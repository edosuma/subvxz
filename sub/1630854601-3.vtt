WEBVTT

00:00.348 --> 00:02.219
Previously on "Below Deck"...

00:02.219 --> 00:03.873
There's no flat water.

00:03.873 --> 00:07.311
As much as you hate to hear it,
I hate to tell you even more.

00:07.311 --> 00:10.445
Bossing is I'm gonna
push you down, make you do it.

00:10.445 --> 00:11.968
That's what
you're just gonna do.

00:11.968 --> 00:14.753
That does not sit
well with me at all.

00:14.753 --> 00:17.060
The pain's getting worse.
Not better.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.366
There we go.

00:18.366 --> 00:20.585
I thought I'd be
running track by now.

00:20.585 --> 00:22.718
Sh--, I can barely
- ing stand up.

00:23.936 --> 00:25.503
Mother----er.

00:25.503 --> 00:26.983
I'm dressing up.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.941
It's gonna be hard to
concentrate on anything else.

00:28.941 --> 00:30.247
Shut up.

00:30.247 --> 00:32.728
I do enjoy the company
of the fairer sex.

00:32.728 --> 00:35.035
Sex being the operative word.

00:36.819 --> 00:39.561
I know that Camille likes Ben,
but she's been a bitch to me,

00:39.561 --> 00:42.129
so I think I'm
still gonna flirt with him.

00:44.609 --> 00:46.655
We're getting
more than we paid for.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.050
Did you enjoy that?

01:23.300 --> 01:25.389
- How are you doing?
- Tired.

01:27.043 --> 01:28.740
No.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.356
Yep, nice.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.402
Where am I?

01:39.795 --> 01:40.883
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:40.883 --> 01:42.145
How are you doing?

01:50.588 --> 01:51.589
Ross, Ross, Lee.

01:51.589 --> 01:52.851
Go ahead, captain.

01:52.851 --> 01:54.157
It looks like
the weather's clear, so...

01:54.157 --> 01:55.550
<i>time to move to the dock.</i>

01:55.550 --> 01:57.813
<i>Make sure
everything is ready to go.</i>

01:57.813 --> 02:00.250
Copy that. Will start
pulling in the nautiboys.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.860
I'm not getting better.

02:01.860 --> 02:05.386
As a captain, you're always
used to being in control.

02:05.386 --> 02:08.084
And to have
to relinquish that control,

02:08.084 --> 02:09.607
even to your own body,

02:09.607 --> 02:12.741
that's a hard thing for
somebody like me to deal with.

02:12.741 --> 02:14.699
It pisses me off.

02:18.921 --> 02:21.576
We need to organize that
mess down the middle there.

02:23.055 --> 02:24.579
Not yet, mate.

02:28.017 --> 02:29.192
I'm really tired,
so I don't

02:29.192 --> 02:31.325
feel really
talking that much today.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.240
So I'm going to
be really quiet.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.850
- Gotcha.
- Thank you.

02:34.850 --> 02:37.287
The first charter
sucked immensely.

02:37.287 --> 02:40.203
You got new crew and all
of us learning a new boat.

02:40.203 --> 02:41.770
She's bigger than Moby's dick.

02:41.770 --> 02:44.947
It's so important for me
to do better this next round.

02:44.947 --> 02:46.731
I need to get my sh-- together.

02:46.731 --> 02:49.169
- Morning, Rachel.
- Morning, sweetheart.

02:52.694 --> 02:55.262
- Did you see Katie?
- No, I haven't seen her.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.177
I was just literally just
coming--

02:57.177 --> 02:59.614
I'm going to go
and wake up Katie.

02:59.614 --> 03:01.616
I'm a little bit
pissed with Katie.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.792
Partying goes hand in
hand with working on yachts.

03:03.792 --> 03:06.360
Sometimes you're bleeding
alcohol out of the skin.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.666
However, you need to
be able to show up for work.

03:11.713 --> 03:13.454
I'm coming, I'm coming.

03:13.454 --> 03:16.587
We're, uh, we're already doing
tendering and everything.

03:16.587 --> 03:18.502
I'll speak to you about,
but I just don't have time.

03:18.502 --> 03:21.505
Okay. I didn't know what time
we were supposed to get up...

03:21.505 --> 03:25.248
I told everyone last night,
7:15. Including you.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.207
We're up to eight tomorrow,
by the way.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.469
- Eight?
- Sorry, what's that, 12?

03:34.083 --> 03:35.867
You need to get
on deck right now.

03:35.867 --> 03:37.739
We'd like pulling stuff.
We're pulling up the hook.

03:37.739 --> 03:39.654
- We're going on the dock.
- My bad.

03:45.137 --> 03:46.313
Gross.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.618
All right,
let's get out of here.

03:47.618 --> 03:49.533
Copy that.
Katie, we're hauling.

03:50.447 --> 03:52.188
- Katie?
- Yeah.

03:52.188 --> 03:54.234
- Hauling.
- Yeah, you're good.

03:55.365 --> 03:56.714
Ross is just
pulling out the anchor.

03:56.714 --> 03:58.281
I literally just rolled
out of bed.

03:58.281 --> 04:00.109
The heaving line...

04:00.109 --> 04:01.371
Don't you do both?

04:01.371 --> 04:03.199
- The little one first.
- Okay.

04:03.199 --> 04:04.983
And then the big one.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.898
I have no bra on right now.

04:06.898 --> 04:08.596
Anchor in the pocket.

04:08.596 --> 04:10.728
<i>Copy that,
let's get out of here.</i>

04:13.731 --> 04:15.516
I'm tired of you, bitch.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.693
Oh, that pillow is disgusting.

04:18.693 --> 04:21.304
What the [bleep] is that, babe?

04:21.304 --> 04:22.305
They look very different.

04:22.305 --> 04:25.439
Oh, absolutely mortifying.

04:25.439 --> 04:27.528
Stop making me laugh,
it's too much.

04:27.528 --> 04:29.312
Darling, there's no skill.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.271
- Get the weight in the top.
- Yeah.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.837
Grab it by
the top and put it down.

04:32.837 --> 04:34.186
- Hold at the top.
- Hold at the top.

04:34.186 --> 04:35.449
Wiggle.

04:35.449 --> 04:37.189
And then you grab it
where you want it.

04:37.189 --> 04:38.669
- Fold it under.
- And you fold it under.

04:38.669 --> 04:41.237
When I was in my early 20s,

04:41.237 --> 04:43.979
I had the chief stew from hell.

04:43.979 --> 04:46.373
Bitch made me sleep
in the bloody laundry room

04:46.373 --> 04:47.678
for two months.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.854
- No. Oh God,
- What have I done?

04:49.854 --> 04:51.421
The complete opposite
of what's been asked.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.902
Oh my gosh.
Was it the other way?

04:53.902 --> 04:56.774
- Yeah.
- But Fraser is so patient.

04:56.774 --> 05:00.300
He's kind.
He's my boat mummy.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.563
- I did it. That's it, isn't it?
- Yeah.

05:02.563 --> 05:04.086
You're like
the bed whisperer, aren't you?

05:04.086 --> 05:05.740
I love housekeeping.

05:05.740 --> 05:08.482
I'm on the good old fender
where it needs to be watch.

05:08.482 --> 05:11.746
You're going to be
between here and the stairs.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.922
<i>Get you sh-- straight now
because I'm heading in</i>

05:13.922 --> 05:16.751
and I want radio silence
and I mean radio silence.

05:16.751 --> 05:18.448
I hear one
peep out of the interior,

05:18.448 --> 05:21.582
<i>somebody's ass is on the line.</i>

05:21.582 --> 05:24.585
The first time you're docking
a new boat, it's intense.

05:24.585 --> 05:25.847
You can't go into it with

05:25.847 --> 05:28.153
"I think I can get it to the
dock"

05:28.153 --> 05:29.764
No, there's none of that sh--.

05:29.764 --> 05:32.070
This is your job.
Get it to the dock.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.594
Quit sniveling.

05:34.856 --> 05:37.989
- God damn it.
<i>- Port side.</i>

05:37.989 --> 05:40.252
<i>Parked boats, 25 feet.</i>

05:40.252 --> 05:42.951
<i>Port bow 30 feet and
closing to the dock.</i>

05:42.951 --> 05:44.953
Seems like we're
going in awful fast.

05:44.953 --> 05:47.434
Right here is about
where I'm going to start reverse

05:47.434 --> 05:49.610
because I just want
to catch on up.

05:49.610 --> 05:52.090
Cap, bow's 15 feet and holding.

05:52.090 --> 05:53.527
Okay, let's ease her on in.

05:53.527 --> 05:55.833
- Send a line.
- Yes, sir.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.400
Tony, this is going to
be quick.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.141
I need you to take
all the tension up.

05:59.141 --> 06:00.360
It's going to be quick.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.709
Straight on there.
Nice, Katie.

06:02.492 --> 06:03.711
Take it up, Tony.

06:03.711 --> 06:05.669
- All right.
- Take it up. Take it up.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.454
Come on, let's take it up.
Take it up.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.369
<i>We don't
have all goddamn day.</i>

06:27.604 --> 06:29.650
You tell me when
the fender's being squeezed.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.303
Strong tension on
the bowline, Cap.

06:31.303 --> 06:32.435
Copy that, thank you.

06:32.435 --> 06:33.828
Now!

06:33.828 --> 06:36.004
Let's tighten up
on the spring lines please.

06:36.004 --> 06:37.266
Come on, Katie.

06:37.266 --> 06:38.789
Cap, foredeck.
The lines are sitting nice.

06:38.789 --> 06:40.530
Happy, all lines are good.

06:40.530 --> 06:41.879
Roger that, thank you gentlemen.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.446
Seems like you've done
that before.

06:43.446 --> 06:44.708
Once or twice.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.843
Why?

06:48.843 --> 06:52.020
Your priorities today are
to get laundry in a place

06:52.020 --> 06:55.197
and then I need you to just do
some of the crew laundry stuff.

06:55.197 --> 06:56.198
Oh, got it. Okay.

06:56.198 --> 06:57.982
Thank you, bub.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.290
We'll get some
washing going, I guess.

07:01.290 --> 07:04.554
Yeah. He might want to wear
your jackets, your rain jacket.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.034
- We can do that.
- Ross. Ross. Lee.

07:06.034 --> 07:07.731
<i>Go ahead, Captain.</i>

07:07.731 --> 07:10.647
Can I get you and the
rest of your deck team

07:10.647 --> 07:12.519
up to the bridge, please?

07:12.519 --> 07:14.172
Oh, boy.
Copy, on the way.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.219
We tried.

07:17.219 --> 07:18.525
Jeez, that----ing steam.

07:18.525 --> 07:21.702
I love how your inside
with sunglasses on.

07:21.702 --> 07:24.444
Ow, I always do that.
It's the 15th time.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.446
- Morning.
- Good morning.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.622
- Haven't seen you yet.
- So...

07:32.539 --> 07:34.192
I thought
we did a good job today.

07:34.192 --> 07:37.892
Thank you.
Docking came off flawlessly.

07:37.892 --> 07:40.938
You guys are doing a good
job and I do appreciate it.

07:40.938 --> 07:42.157
Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.

07:42.157 --> 07:43.550
Carry on.

07:43.550 --> 07:44.812
Thanks, cap.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.944
- Thank you.
- Let's go, guys.

07:49.077 --> 07:52.167
Interior, interior.
Let's go have a meeting

07:52.167 --> 07:54.038
<i>in the Sky Lounge, please.</i>

07:54.038 --> 07:55.431
On my way, Fraser.

07:55.431 --> 07:56.432
- Hello.
- Hi.

07:56.432 --> 07:57.694
Hi.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.435
- How are we doing?
- Great.

07:59.435 --> 08:00.784
- Good.
- Good?

08:00.784 --> 08:03.004
Well, guys,
I just wanted to say, obviously,

08:03.004 --> 08:05.876
overall, we're going through
teething issues at the moment.

08:05.876 --> 08:07.748
It got dark at some point,

08:07.748 --> 08:10.228
but we got through it and we're
going to get to that again.

08:10.228 --> 08:13.797
So we continue
thinking sh-- we are lowest low,

08:13.797 --> 08:16.191
but we still just did it.

08:16.191 --> 08:18.585
I think we all
get along really well.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.282
- Generally.
- Definitely.

08:20.282 --> 08:21.588
- Generally, yes.
- Generally.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.546
I know that you told Camille

08:23.546 --> 08:25.853
to finish up
the Sky Lounge and then

08:25.853 --> 08:27.376
she stomped her feet
a little bit at the fact

08:27.376 --> 08:29.857
that I was asking her
to vacuum up the crew area.

08:29.857 --> 08:31.772
We're not going to always see
eye to eye on the same thing.

08:31.772 --> 08:34.688
That is human nature.
That is life. That is so normal.

08:34.688 --> 08:36.385
But we're going to be
short with each other.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.779
- Let's try not.
- Right.

08:38.779 --> 08:41.042
You guys are amazing.
Thank you so much.

08:41.042 --> 08:42.043
Brilliant, let's go.

08:42.043 --> 08:42.957
Okay. Thank you.

08:42.957 --> 08:45.655
Damn it, [bleep] me in the ass.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.574
Oh, that's
the most terrible noise.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.577
Right, let's take a tea break.

08:54.577 --> 08:56.144
All right,
I'll see you down there.

08:56.144 --> 08:58.233
Katie, I'll just have
a quick word with you here.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.277
Yeah.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.935
All right,
as you know,

09:06.850 --> 09:09.636
I mean, I'm pretty sure
I told everyone 7:15.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.159
I know. I totally
didn't hear that.

09:11.159 --> 09:12.856
Obviously, you know,
I'm not happy about it.

09:12.856 --> 09:14.031
We can't be late on deck.

09:14.031 --> 09:15.293
It lets
the rest of the team down.

09:15.293 --> 09:16.381
Of course.

09:16.381 --> 09:17.861
It's probably not coincidental.

09:17.861 --> 09:20.168
it happened after an evening out
with alcohol involved.

09:20.168 --> 09:21.648
- Yeah.
- Obviously we don't want to

09:21.648 --> 09:23.475
make a repeat performance of it.

09:23.475 --> 09:25.652
It definitely does suck
more when

09:25.652 --> 09:27.131
you're getting reprimanded
and you're messing up

09:27.131 --> 09:29.003
in front of the guy
that you have a crush on.

09:29.003 --> 09:30.482
You know,
being a girl on deck,

09:30.482 --> 09:32.180
you do have to kind of work
harder than the guys and

09:32.180 --> 09:34.269
you do have to prove to
yourself day in and day out.

09:34.269 --> 09:37.620
It's such a sinking feeling.
It's like... sh--.

09:37.620 --> 09:41.319
If it happens again, I will have
to let Captain know about it.

09:41.319 --> 09:42.799
Yeah, of course.

09:44.192 --> 09:45.193
Coming up...

09:45.193 --> 09:48.413
Smile. Smile.
Hold on, hold on.

09:48.413 --> 09:49.719
Babe, what are you doing?

09:50.981 --> 09:54.245
She literally yanked
a wig off of a living lady.

09:54.245 --> 09:55.682
Uh... mmm...

09:55.682 --> 09:57.771
If you don't check her,
I'm going to check her.

09:57.771 --> 10:06.562
And that's sh--
not going to go okay.

10:06.562 --> 10:07.563
Rachel...

10:09.870 --> 10:11.872
Oh my God, okay.

10:15.571 --> 10:16.877
Yeah, man, this is all right.

10:16.877 --> 10:18.530
You can just throw
it back there.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.271
- From here to here.
- Yeah.

10:28.497 --> 10:31.065
Party in captain's cabin!

10:31.065 --> 10:32.675
So, can we come in, sir?

10:32.675 --> 10:35.504
Yes. That's a little bit
after the fact,

10:35.504 --> 10:36.897
but of course you can.

10:36.897 --> 10:39.464
- How are you doing?
- I'm excellent.

10:39.464 --> 10:42.119
I am particular
about my clothing.

10:42.119 --> 10:45.688
I was actually in
the laundry room thinking,

10:45.688 --> 10:47.777
like I'm sure you get
used to this.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.039
Crease always goes in the front.

10:50.214 --> 10:52.652
Casual shirts, they get
pressed but never dried.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.175
Right.

10:54.175 --> 10:56.481
We work on a super yacht,
not a----ing tramp steamer.

10:56.481 --> 10:59.354
That shirt had more
wrinkles than a basketball.

10:59.354 --> 11:00.790
I'll repress.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.010
But rest assured, I'll
be more than happy

11:03.010 --> 11:04.533
to teach you.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.622
- We're on a superyacht.
- Understandable.

11:06.622 --> 11:07.623
- What is this?
- What are we scrubbing?

11:07.623 --> 11:09.538
This is a sports pole.

11:09.538 --> 11:11.671
- That's so cute.
- This could be yours.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.020
Probably is
about the right height.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.805
Perfect. Yeah.
Look at it. Almost too big.

11:15.805 --> 11:18.765
We re-ironed his shirts,
like eight times now.

11:21.071 --> 11:23.813
Thank you.
I love activities.

11:23.813 --> 11:26.033
I don't like sitting still.
Unless I'm tired.

11:26.033 --> 11:28.731
What is the craziest activity
that you have ever done?

11:28.731 --> 11:30.254
Sh--, I've jumped
out of plane's drunk.

11:30.254 --> 11:32.735
still from the night before.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.737
No, I'm not even kidding.

11:34.737 --> 11:36.565
What's the craziest
thing you've done?

11:36.565 --> 11:38.349
Play with sharks, huh?

11:38.349 --> 11:40.569
Okay, so we've
done that in the Bahamas.

11:40.569 --> 11:43.964
I really like Rachel because
I think she's crazy as hell.

11:43.964 --> 11:46.401
- Yeah, we did the same.
- Woo!

11:46.401 --> 11:49.143
She is just like one
of my ex-girlfriends,

11:49.143 --> 11:51.406
and she feeds me so
immediately I love her

11:51.406 --> 11:53.538
because she's
putting food in this belly.

11:53.538 --> 11:56.672
My second officer was chumming
the water inside the cage.

11:56.672 --> 11:58.892
That----er.

11:58.892 --> 12:01.764
Ross, Rachel and Mr. Olender,
could I see you three

12:01.764 --> 12:04.593
up in the sky lounge for
a preparation meeting, please?

12:04.593 --> 12:05.899
Copy, Captain.
Coming now.

12:10.381 --> 12:11.818
I am greasy.

12:11.818 --> 12:12.906
Pick them up.

12:12.906 --> 12:14.777
Okay, we've got Michelle Pearl.

12:14.777 --> 12:17.127
She's an E.R.
doc based in Seattle.

12:17.127 --> 12:18.825
Michelle and her girlfriends,
they've been

12:18.825 --> 12:20.087
traveling the world
together since

12:20.087 --> 12:22.045
they met back
in their residency.

12:22.045 --> 12:23.960
Ten years as E.R. physicians.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.788
So it's all about the party.

12:25.788 --> 12:28.182
Day one, Hollywood glam night.

12:28.182 --> 12:30.793
Multi course menu,
highlighting truffles.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.534
I love truffle.
It's rich.

12:32.534 --> 12:34.188
It's great on everything.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.103
It's going to be epic
and they're going to love it.

12:36.103 --> 12:38.801
You pay me to come in
and I will----ing slaughter

12:38.801 --> 12:40.455
the [bleep] out of
whatever you need.

12:40.455 --> 12:42.326
I am the menu murderer.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.546
Night two,
they want a beach picnic,

12:44.546 --> 12:47.636
and then we come back for a red,
black and gold vintage

12:47.636 --> 12:49.072
Moulin Rouge dance party.

12:49.072 --> 12:51.031
It's a late pickup,
so no need for lunch.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.293
- I like it.
- This sounds like we're going

12:52.293 --> 12:54.512
to have a good
time with these people.

12:55.731 --> 12:56.906
Thank you, sir.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.386
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

12:58.386 --> 13:01.432
You turned the sink on
and left this in the sink.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.217
Oh, I so didn't.

13:03.217 --> 13:04.653
- You did.
- We got a poltergeist.

13:04.653 --> 13:05.915
Maybe...

13:05.915 --> 13:09.136
- Captain Lee?
- Come in.

13:09.136 --> 13:10.833
I'm going to get this right. Eventually.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.008
You will.
No problem.

13:12.008 --> 13:14.532
- Looks great.
- That's good.

13:14.532 --> 13:16.273
Gold coast.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.145
It's like right on the border
of Queensland and South Wales.

13:18.145 --> 13:19.711
But people ask me
where I'm from

13:19.711 --> 13:23.150
and everyone thinks
I'm like, Spanish.

13:23.150 --> 13:25.892
Italiano!

13:25.892 --> 13:26.893
I'm indigenous Australian.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.633
Like native Australian.

13:28.633 --> 13:31.114
That's why I'm this color.
Dad is white, mom is dark.

13:31.114 --> 13:34.291
A cool study found that the
Australian indigenous people,

13:34.291 --> 13:35.597
like, from my heritage

13:35.597 --> 13:37.773
are the oldest living
culture at the moment.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.383
So I'm actually more
Australian than anyone

13:39.383 --> 13:40.689
you've probably ever met.

13:40.689 --> 13:42.212
In primary school,
the kids would be

13:42.212 --> 13:44.519
like, oh, you're dark,
you should be with a dark girl.

13:44.519 --> 13:48.305
So I think I was kind of lucky
that they got us away from that.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.568
Went to the east coast
where everything is a bit more,

13:50.568 --> 13:52.353
I suppose,
accepted and everyone's

13:52.353 --> 13:54.442
tanned already, so you can't
tell who's different anyway.

14:03.364 --> 14:04.365
Yeah.

14:04.365 --> 14:05.583
And I think, like...

14:05.583 --> 14:06.889
We found some
common ground within that.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.064
Something to
build something off.

14:08.064 --> 14:09.457
Exactly.

14:10.762 --> 14:12.895
My man.
We're the same skin.

14:12.895 --> 14:15.332
- Yeah.
- That's so funny, man.

14:16.812 --> 14:18.292
What the...

14:18.292 --> 14:20.555
Was that my arse?

14:20.555 --> 14:21.643
It's me.
It's all right.

14:21.643 --> 14:22.992
Nothing to see here.

14:22.992 --> 14:24.820
Just don't walk
right into that vicinity.

14:29.303 --> 14:31.914
You need to pay attention
today and start working.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.569
This is all of our mixers

14:34.569 --> 14:37.485
and liqueurs and
stuff like that.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.052
I love you so much.

14:39.052 --> 14:40.401
And then this
is all of our liquor.

14:40.401 --> 14:43.012
Cool. Yeah,
you guys----ing...

14:44.100 --> 14:46.668
Phew.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.365
Tired by now?
Jesus.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.067
- We got pizza.
- Woo.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.546
Yay!

14:55.546 --> 14:58.288
Oh, I just got so my tits
are so sweaty.

14:58.288 --> 15:01.465
Guys, our Captain,
I feel so bad for him.

15:01.465 --> 15:02.814
He clearly is just like...

15:02.814 --> 15:03.859
Don't, it actually
really upsets me.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.252
So disappointed in himself.

15:05.252 --> 15:06.862
- And that's so sad...
- Really upsets me.

15:06.862 --> 15:08.603
- ...to like watch.
- It's really not nice.

15:08.603 --> 15:11.388
Every time I see him,
every time I walk in his room,

15:11.388 --> 15:13.260
His eyes are like,
yay, somebody's here.

15:13.260 --> 15:16.828
Captain Lee, unfortunately
can't move fast at the moment.

15:18.482 --> 15:19.875
It concerns me.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.398
I don't want him
to ever be in a sticky situation

15:21.398 --> 15:24.880
to where he can't
perform to his full capacity.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.621
My father is very sick.

15:26.621 --> 15:29.102
He's not able to physically
accomplish the things

15:29.102 --> 15:30.668
he wants to accomplish.

15:30.668 --> 15:33.280
So when I see Captain Lee
like this, I feel like I do have

15:33.280 --> 15:35.282
a bit of an understanding
of what he's going through.

15:35.282 --> 15:39.155
- It makes me sad.
- He wants to be a part of this.

15:39.155 --> 15:40.940
He really does
want to be a part of it.

15:42.463 --> 15:43.246
Coming up...

15:43.246 --> 15:44.769
<i>Coming towards the dock.</i>

15:44.769 --> 15:45.988
<i>Closing.</i>

15:45.988 --> 15:47.468
We gotta get that stern off.

15:47.468 --> 15:49.818
We're gonna
hit where we can't fender.

15:49.818 --> 16:00.655
God damn it!

16:32.295 --> 16:34.210
I'm exhausted.

16:34.210 --> 16:37.039
Haley.
Camille. Alissa.

16:38.345 --> 16:39.563
Come on.

16:39.563 --> 16:40.564
- Morning.
- Morning.

16:40.564 --> 16:41.826
Morning.

16:41.826 --> 16:43.263
Let's start getting those buckets

16:43.263 --> 16:45.308
for the wipe down
prepared and put the flag up.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.136
Yes. Let's get that----ing
thing up.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.312
You guys, before you make
the beds, look under them.

16:49.312 --> 16:52.141
See if there's
anything in the little

16:52.141 --> 16:53.664
ports that are down there.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.144
- Got it?
- Yeah, yeah.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.885
Okay. See you all later.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.107
- Let's go this way.
- To here?

17:01.107 --> 17:02.760
No, that goes over here.
There you go.

17:02.760 --> 17:06.460
What are you doing? We've never
done that before in our lives.

17:06.460 --> 17:09.245
Oh, my gosh.
Look at the lampshade.

17:09.245 --> 17:11.334
<i>All crew, all crew, provisions
on the dock.</i>

17:11.334 --> 17:12.988
<i>Interior, if you wouldn't
mind helping,</i>

17:12.988 --> 17:15.077
that would be great
for this one.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.949
Oh, my gosh. This part sucks.

17:17.949 --> 17:22.084
Up and down and up
and----ing down.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.175
Got all pretty. I'm just
going to sweat it all off.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.532
- How are we doing, Katie?
- Good.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.317
After oversleeping
the night before,

17:37.317 --> 17:39.101
I definitely have
that pressure.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.538
In Miami, Yacht owners look at
you and think,

17:41.538 --> 17:43.584
oh, she just wants to be
someone's sugar baby.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.107
I'm not like that.

17:45.107 --> 17:46.674
It might be a pretty face,
but I know how to rock it.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.459
There you go, darling.

17:49.459 --> 17:51.113
- I really need a pillow.
- And this is clean.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.636
Wait, do you not have one?

17:52.636 --> 17:55.422
I have one, but it's
like rock hard and large.

17:55.422 --> 17:57.119
You don't like
rock hard and large?

17:57.119 --> 17:59.078
Oh, I love rock hard and large.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.470
- But not...
- For your head.

18:00.470 --> 18:01.602
Under my head.

18:01.602 --> 18:02.733
- More like...
- In front of your head.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.083
In my face.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.736
Okay, well, that was
a great conversation.

18:05.736 --> 18:06.737
I'll see you later.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.087
Attention all crew,

18:08.087 --> 18:09.697
charter guests will be here
in 30 minutes.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.133
Let's get changed.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.395
What are we going to get
changed into now, though?

18:12.395 --> 18:14.093
- Whites.
- I've got yours right here.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.399
Okay. I'll come back.
Do you have yours ready?

18:16.399 --> 18:18.140
I'll press my own
and you change.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.141
Okay, great.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.316
- Alissa?
- Yes?

18:20.316 --> 18:21.752
Can I borrow
you one second, please?

18:21.752 --> 18:23.189
- Yes.
- What's in here?

18:23.189 --> 18:24.842
- This is sauvignon?
- This is all white.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.496
I know for sure.

18:26.496 --> 18:28.107
Yeah, you just
incorporate into that time

18:28.107 --> 18:29.934
- that you need to get ready.
- Okay, great.

18:29.934 --> 18:31.110
Cool.

18:32.372 --> 18:33.547
God.

18:33.547 --> 18:36.289
Do I look like
a ginger pineapple?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.990
Why am I nice enough
to offer to do it myself?

18:43.600 --> 18:45.602
Getting the boy uniforms?
No, it's not.

18:46.908 --> 18:48.692
You know how Camille
was supposed to do her whites?

18:48.692 --> 18:50.564
She didn't finish it,
and I thought she had something

18:50.564 --> 18:52.522
to do, so I was like,
you go do what you got to do.

18:52.522 --> 18:55.351
And then she likes Fraser, she's
like, can I go take a cigarette?

18:55.351 --> 18:57.658
Fraser needs to stop being
so lenient with Camille.

18:59.355 --> 19:01.401
It's kind of getting
on my nerves right now.

19:01.401 --> 19:04.143
It's backfiring on the team and
it's making me feel like sh--.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.405
How can you feel comfortable

19:05.405 --> 19:07.624
putting the job that was
assigned to you

19:07.624 --> 19:09.800
on somebody else
to go take a cigarette?

19:09.800 --> 19:11.541
That's nice.

19:11.541 --> 19:14.762
- Not you.
- No, I know that.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.416
But maybe you.

19:16.416 --> 19:18.592
Tony, if you just
want to go top to bottom,

19:18.592 --> 19:20.811
- just looking for details.
- No problem.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.204
<i>Attention, all crew,</i>

19:22.204 --> 19:24.989
I need everybody on
the aft deck in five.

19:24.989 --> 19:27.122
<i>Copy that, Captain.</i>

19:30.952 --> 19:32.432
I cannot believe
we're doing this.

19:35.043 --> 19:36.697
no.
How close are they?

19:38.525 --> 19:40.004
There's a lot of
glamor on the dock.

19:40.004 --> 19:41.745
There's a lot
of glamor right here.

19:41.745 --> 19:43.269
- There we go.
- Right?

19:43.269 --> 19:45.575
- Hey.
- Yay.

19:45.575 --> 19:47.186
- Hello.
- Hi.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.666
- Hello.
- We're so happy to be here.

19:49.666 --> 19:51.712
- Glad to have you.
- Michelle, nice to meet you.

19:51.712 --> 19:53.366
- Captain Lee.
- Fraser, nice to meet you.

19:53.366 --> 19:54.976
- Welcome aboard.
- Alla.

19:54.976 --> 19:56.804
- Ben
- Cheers.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.502
Welcome aboard, ladies.

19:59.502 --> 20:01.243
We are here at your service

20:01.243 --> 20:03.114
to just knock this out
of the park.

20:03.114 --> 20:07.467
It's so nice to do something
for somebody that has sacrificed

20:07.467 --> 20:10.121
the way they have
over the last two years.

20:10.121 --> 20:11.688
These are the doctors
you're going to see

20:11.688 --> 20:14.387
when you go into
the emergency room,

20:14.387 --> 20:16.519
and they're
going to save your life.

20:16.519 --> 20:18.913
If you want to get drunk and
puke over the side of the boat,

20:18.913 --> 20:21.698
guess what? Cappy will be right
there holding your hair back.

20:21.698 --> 20:24.832
Their service and dedication
means that much to me.

20:24.832 --> 20:27.182
I'm going to have
Mr. Olender give you a tour of

20:27.182 --> 20:29.010
the vessel
and we will get underway.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.533
- All right.
- Thank you, guys.

20:30.533 --> 20:31.621
Thank you.

20:31.621 --> 20:32.927
Do you want
to follow me up here?

20:32.927 --> 20:34.233
Yes.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.712
The girls always have
so much sh--.

20:35.712 --> 20:37.801
We're going to try and
avoid taking glassware

20:37.801 --> 20:39.281
on any of the decks

20:39.281 --> 20:40.891
just because I don't want
anyone getting hurt.

20:40.891 --> 20:42.241
Even though your nurses,
I'm pretty sure you can...

20:42.241 --> 20:43.242
...Deal with it.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.287
Doctors, sorry.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.811
This is awkward.

20:50.118 --> 20:52.642
Glad I did that now, right?

20:52.642 --> 20:54.557
Don't forget Louis.
Constant charter guest, Louis.

20:54.557 --> 20:57.560
- This is your master suite.
- Is this yours?

20:57.560 --> 21:00.955
We could probably fit three
or four ladies in this room.

21:00.955 --> 21:02.304
Right now, we're going to have
snacks go up.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.175
And I also
have bread, too, to go.

21:04.175 --> 21:05.351
Yeah, cool.

21:05.351 --> 21:06.526
So this is our...

21:06.526 --> 21:07.831
Sam and
I will take the twin beds,

21:07.831 --> 21:09.093
and then you can
have the big bed yourself.

21:09.093 --> 21:10.399
Yeah, but I don't need that.

21:10.399 --> 21:11.531
- Well, then we...
- They want theirs.

21:11.531 --> 21:13.576
Oh, excuse me, okay. Fine.

21:13.576 --> 21:15.926
Listen...

21:18.277 --> 21:20.104
- Prepare to disembark.
- Copy. Standing by.

21:20.104 --> 21:21.715
Standing by on the bow.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.412
All right, let's go.
Bow to stern, commencing now.

21:23.412 --> 21:24.674
And pull, pull, pull, pull.

21:28.112 --> 21:31.115
Let's hustle on
that goddamn stern line.

21:31.115 --> 21:33.509
Pull it in, Katie. Go, go, go.

21:34.684 --> 21:36.338
Roger that. Thank you.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.210
...holding.

21:39.210 --> 21:40.647
Can you watch
the fenders, please?

21:40.647 --> 21:41.517
Yeah.

21:41.517 --> 21:43.302
Starboard quarter five feet.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.694
Coming towards the dock. Closing.

21:45.956 --> 21:46.957
We got to get that stern off.

21:46.957 --> 21:48.568
There's a lot of wind,

21:48.568 --> 21:50.787
so the boat's not as responsive
as I would like it to be.

21:50.787 --> 21:53.224
Closing 15 feet.
12 feet.

21:53.224 --> 21:54.443
Closing 10 feet.

21:54.443 --> 21:56.967
You can do a lot
of damage in 15 seconds

21:56.967 --> 21:58.404
with 1000 tons on the move.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.231
- Oh, it's moving.
- I don't like it.

22:00.231 --> 22:02.059
Closing four feet.

22:02.059 --> 22:04.801
But it's getting close to a spot
where a fender can't reach.

22:04.801 --> 22:06.412
We're going to hit.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.808
Starboard quarter three feet, closing.

22:13.332 --> 22:16.683
God damn it.

22:16.683 --> 22:19.338
Cap, you're
gonna have to push ahead.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.252
We're gonna
hit where we can't fender

22:21.252 --> 22:22.341
God damn it.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.777
Three feet.
Cap, forward.

22:23.777 --> 22:26.345
<i>You've got no
obstructions ahead.</i>

22:28.390 --> 22:30.436
Okay, we're opening fast.

22:30.436 --> 22:33.352
Oh, my God.
That was so----ing close.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.179
Did I make you nervous?

22:35.179 --> 22:37.094
Close doesn't count.

22:37.094 --> 22:38.792
If you miss it by two inches,

22:38.792 --> 22:41.490
you miss it by 20 miles,
you still missed it.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.187
That's why you
get the big bucks.

22:43.187 --> 22:45.494
All right, guys, let's
get these lines up to the bow.

22:45.494 --> 22:47.496
- Thank you.
- This is beautiful.

22:47.496 --> 22:49.019
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, look at that view!

22:49.019 --> 22:50.673
That looks amazing.

22:50.673 --> 22:52.109
Alissa.

22:52.109 --> 22:53.894
Florida.

22:53.894 --> 22:56.505
I live in Orlando right now with

22:56.505 --> 22:58.681
like, 100 Jamaican
family members, yeah.

22:58.681 --> 23:00.422
That's how we do it,
though, right?

23:00.422 --> 23:02.250
- My dad is from Jamaica.
- No, which one?

23:02.250 --> 23:04.078
Yeah, he's from St. Anne.

23:05.601 --> 23:08.212
My work ethic
definitely comes from my dad.

23:08.212 --> 23:10.127
He moved to Delaware
from Jamaica

23:10.127 --> 23:11.477
when he was twelve years old.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.435
You can be my cousin.
We don't know.

23:13.435 --> 23:15.698
He obviously was teased
for his accent,

23:15.698 --> 23:18.832
the food that he ate, and
he went on to be a pilot,

23:18.832 --> 23:21.487
a real estate agent,
an entrepreneur.

23:21.487 --> 23:25.229
My relationship with my dad
right now is pretty rocky.

23:25.229 --> 23:27.406
He's really controlling,
really strict.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.451
But at the end of the day,
even if we're not close,

23:29.451 --> 23:31.279
I still want to make him proud.

23:31.279 --> 23:33.194
Can I get a double Bailey's?

23:33.194 --> 23:35.022
For some reason,
I just want a rum cream.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.545
Yes, sir.

23:36.545 --> 23:40.897
I was thinking I'd give
Ben a go at doing the anchor.

23:40.897 --> 23:43.247
I wanted to know
how you felt about that.

23:43.247 --> 23:44.553
Has you been versed on it?

23:44.553 --> 23:45.772
Yeah, we've been
training through it.

23:45.772 --> 23:47.426
Okay.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.862
Overall, the team's doing really
well. I'm very happy with them.

23:48.862 --> 23:50.820
Ben's my most
experienced crew member,

23:50.820 --> 23:52.561
and he knows what he's
doing in a lot of areas.

23:52.561 --> 23:54.171
If you're comfortable
with it, so am I.

23:54.171 --> 23:57.174
Yeah. It's important
that I manage to delegate

23:57.174 --> 23:59.002
some of
the key responsibilities.

23:59.002 --> 24:01.440
Otherwise I'm running around
this boat like a mental man.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.571
, It's exhausting.

24:02.571 --> 24:04.051
Thanks, Ross.
Well done at the dock.

24:04.051 --> 24:06.009
Yeah, thank you. You too.

24:06.009 --> 24:07.228
Skinny margarita.

24:07.228 --> 24:09.099
Yes, girl.

24:09.099 --> 24:10.579
Okay, deck team,
I think that went pretty well.

24:10.579 --> 24:12.189
- Yes.
- Yeah.

24:12.189 --> 24:16.367
Coming up to the anchors,
how do you feel about being...

24:19.414 --> 24:20.589
Yeah? Let's get these
fenders in,

24:20.589 --> 24:22.417
let's get changed,
get some water,

24:22.417 --> 24:24.027
and then let's get
back at it.

24:24.027 --> 24:25.202
Michelle's my work wife.

24:25.202 --> 24:27.378
We work three shifts together.

24:27.378 --> 24:28.467
We run a pod in the E.R. together.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.859
It's so great.

24:29.859 --> 24:31.470
It's always good to
have friends at work.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.167
Nothing more comforting
than running a code

24:33.167 --> 24:34.342
with your best friend.

24:34.342 --> 24:36.170
What's food for dinner?

24:36.170 --> 24:37.867
Lamb.

24:37.867 --> 24:40.696
It'll be tiny, little itty
bitty bites all doing truffle.

24:40.696 --> 24:42.611
We're going to do
it kind of like an Italianesque

24:42.611 --> 24:44.047
Mediterranean theme.

24:44.047 --> 24:45.614
I love this.

24:45.614 --> 24:48.835
I'm going to have
a Hollywood Glam-themed dinner.

24:48.835 --> 24:51.925
I'm like, what the [bleep]?
You wouldn't have a dinner.

24:51.925 --> 24:57.278
You'd be anorexia fueled
on cocaine, vodka, and hate.

24:57.278 --> 25:00.281
And also, there's so
much decor for tonight's party

25:00.281 --> 25:02.152
that I really need to
start thinking about that.

25:02.152 --> 25:03.327
Yes, please.

25:03.327 --> 25:04.633
Let's prep for anchor.

25:04.633 --> 25:06.417
Copy, cap, you got Ben
up on the foredeck.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.550
I'm like your dog
falling behind you.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.857
- Yeah.
- And drop now.

25:13.033 --> 25:15.601
I swear we'll be really cool.
We're very low maintenance.

25:17.385 --> 25:18.647
<i>Cap, that's four shots on deck.</i>

25:18.647 --> 25:21.258
<i>Copy that. Lock it in
right there.</i>

25:21.258 --> 25:22.477
<i>Good job, Ben.</i>

25:22.477 --> 25:24.827
<i>Copy that, Cap. Thanks.</i>

25:24.827 --> 25:27.787
- Extra spicy s'il vest plait.
- Absolutely.

25:27.787 --> 25:29.179
- Same thing?
- Please, please, please.

25:29.179 --> 25:30.833
No problem.

25:35.621 --> 25:36.578
Camille, can I help
you with anything?

25:36.578 --> 25:38.058
Oh, you know what you could do?

25:38.058 --> 25:40.451
There's two skinny spicy
margs that need to go out.

25:40.451 --> 25:41.496
Margs? Cool.

25:41.496 --> 25:42.497
- It's good?
- Yeah.

25:42.497 --> 25:43.716
- Yep.
- There you go.

25:47.981 --> 25:50.636
I've got your drinks
right here, okay?

25:50.636 --> 25:52.072
We need more drinks!

25:52.072 --> 25:54.204
More, more, more!

25:54.204 --> 25:56.163
<i>Alissa, Camille.</i>

25:56.163 --> 25:57.556
<i>What can I do for you, boo?</i>

25:59.645 --> 26:02.691
Looking good, babe.
I'm looking good.

26:03.518 --> 26:04.563
Oh, sh--.

26:04.563 --> 26:05.868
Who put that there?

26:05.868 --> 26:08.654
Yeah, she's just
having a moment, I think.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.090
We might actually
have to get you to move because

26:10.090 --> 26:13.006
I think we're going
to try and tidy this.

26:13.006 --> 26:16.618
I heard you, sorry,
I was carrying the drinks.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.316
Hi, two skinny margaritas?

26:19.316 --> 26:22.058
Interior. Interior. Can you
get into your blacks, please?

26:22.058 --> 26:23.233
Agh!

26:23.233 --> 26:24.583
Cankles on fire.

26:25.975 --> 26:27.586
This is your cover up,
isn't it, baby?

26:27.586 --> 26:29.152
- Pink one?
- Pink one's mine.

26:29.152 --> 26:31.851
Okay, we'll take them
down to laundry and dry them.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.334
Gorgeous. This is my
favorite time of the day, guys.

26:37.334 --> 26:41.295
What, standing on the main aft
deck not doing anything?

26:41.295 --> 26:42.601
Sunset?

26:46.517 --> 26:49.477
How does one
do things around here?

26:51.000 --> 26:53.655
That looks horrendous,
but what do you want from me?

26:53.655 --> 26:55.744
We'll have an Oscar here.

26:55.744 --> 26:58.921
I love this corny little party
that's about to pop off.

26:58.921 --> 27:00.096
I know, right?

27:05.711 --> 27:07.451
For tonight's dinner,
our charter guests

27:07.451 --> 27:09.410
have requested truffle.

27:09.410 --> 27:11.368
I call this
for all these beautiful,

27:11.368 --> 27:12.761
wonderful women doctors,

27:12.761 --> 27:14.850
the mufftruff experience.

27:18.419 --> 27:21.030
Well, guess what? I can't
find my----ing truffles.

27:21.030 --> 27:23.772
So we're now having
a truffle kerfuffle.

27:25.295 --> 27:26.775
Oh, damn it.

27:26.775 --> 27:27.950
I can't.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.256
Okay, we've got literally
15 minutes

27:29.256 --> 27:31.301
to get everything up here.

27:31.301 --> 27:33.303
Stars are going to be up here.

27:38.134 --> 27:39.309
Sorry.

27:39.309 --> 27:41.485
Jewel, you are 20
minutes late already.

27:41.485 --> 27:42.486
Get your clothes on, sister.

27:42.486 --> 27:43.705
First of all...

27:43.705 --> 27:45.794
Jewel, I am a hungry
white bitch.

27:45.794 --> 27:48.754
Yeah, we need to put
a big hose somewhere else.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.756
All right, ladies, let's go.

27:50.756 --> 27:53.367
Jewel, I need you,
honey, right now.

27:53.367 --> 27:56.544
You make me wait to eat,
I am going to cut a bitch.

27:58.415 --> 27:59.808
VIP.

27:59.808 --> 28:01.157
What?

28:01.157 --> 28:04.726
Welcome to
your Hollywood Oscar theme.

28:04.726 --> 28:07.598
Yes. What?
Strut the red carpet, babe.

28:08.643 --> 28:11.472
Wait the Oscar goes to...

28:11.472 --> 28:14.867
Jewel Jones.
Jewel Jones.

28:14.867 --> 28:17.913
I think the Oscar
goes to Michelle.

28:17.913 --> 28:21.351
I think so. I think Dr. Pearl
deserves it every time.

28:21.351 --> 28:24.528
Getting us
all here was...

28:24.528 --> 28:25.529
- Miracle.
- Monumental.

28:25.529 --> 28:26.792
A miracle.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.663
I cannot believe
I----ing did that.

28:28.663 --> 28:30.491
I think I lost my truffle.

28:30.491 --> 28:32.014
Please, dear Lord,
be in here.

28:32.014 --> 28:36.062
If not, you know what?
Just I'm going to retire.

28:36.062 --> 28:38.368
Okay, ready?
One, two, three.

28:38.368 --> 28:43.765
Whatever you normally do, don't
do it because it's not working.

28:46.899 --> 28:50.598
I like to look off to the side.
It's not working.

28:51.599 --> 28:53.253
Babe, what are you doing?

28:56.865 --> 29:01.217
She literally yanked
a wig off of a living lady.

29:02.610 --> 29:03.872
Okay, ready?

29:03.872 --> 29:05.569
Smile.
Smile.

29:05.569 --> 29:07.615
Uh... Mmm...

29:07.615 --> 29:09.965
I was just teasing you. Jewel.

29:13.795 --> 29:14.883
I actually want to go
to the bathroom.

29:14.883 --> 29:16.102
You want to come?
Come.

29:16.102 --> 29:17.190
Sure.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.110
Anybody need a top off?

29:28.201 --> 29:29.768
Can I give you
a little top off?

29:29.768 --> 29:31.595
If you don't check her,

29:31.595 --> 29:41.780
I'm going to check her and that
sh-- is not going to go okay.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.217
I said everyone do
something different

29:44.217 --> 29:47.046
and she pulls my hair.
Why is she pulling my hair?

29:51.528 --> 29:54.618
It took everything in me not...

29:54.618 --> 29:55.881
Michelle.

30:00.973 --> 30:03.018
The blondie is
like tipsy as hell

30:03.018 --> 30:05.891
and she pulled the Black woman
in the blue dresses wig

30:05.891 --> 30:07.196
and it slipped back for real.

30:07.196 --> 30:09.590
- Okay. Hold on.
- It's not working.

30:09.590 --> 30:10.852
Babe...

30:10.852 --> 30:12.593
It was literally...

30:12.593 --> 30:14.160
That's hellish.

30:14.160 --> 30:15.857
When is dinner?
The dinner is at nine.

30:15.857 --> 30:17.293
- Hey, Fraser.
- Yeah?

30:17.293 --> 30:19.643
Our dinner was supposed
to start a half an hour ago.

30:19.643 --> 30:20.862
What's going on?
We're hungry.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.690
I just gotta find the truffle.

30:28.043 --> 30:29.392
No!

30:29.392 --> 30:31.307
Let's go.
Let's do it, ladies, let's go.

30:31.307 --> 30:35.007
How soon can you have
your first course on the table?

30:35.007 --> 30:36.791
- I'm about to plate.
- Brilliant.

30:36.791 --> 30:37.836
- Okay. Thank you.
- Amazing.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.533
With a bigger sized vessel,

30:39.533 --> 30:40.926
it's so easy
to lose sh--.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.884
Don't [bleep] with me today.

30:42.884 --> 30:44.973
And I still can't
find the truffle.

30:44.973 --> 30:46.801
I'm going to have to
pull out everything that has

30:46.801 --> 30:48.890
truffle inside of it.

30:48.890 --> 30:51.850
Truffle pecorino cheese,
truffle salts,

30:51.850 --> 30:53.982
truffle powder,
lots of mushrooms

30:53.982 --> 30:56.028
and maybe they won't notice.

30:56.028 --> 30:58.334
Interior, I know it
sounds crazy, but

30:58.334 --> 31:00.423
I got some stuff
to go out at the table.

31:00.423 --> 31:01.947
<i>No problem.</i>

31:03.383 --> 31:06.865
Hey, we have mushroom
and truffles.

31:07.691 --> 31:10.303
I love me some truffles.

31:10.303 --> 31:12.174
- Lovely.
- Mm-mm.

31:12.174 --> 31:13.610
Hello.

31:13.610 --> 31:16.831
What's going... you've got
black gloves on, too?

31:16.831 --> 31:18.964
Yeah.
Bend over and cough.

31:18.964 --> 31:21.140
It's kind of working
as an outfit going on here.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.011
This is really
nice presentation.

31:23.011 --> 31:25.448
Thanks. I pulled that
out of my----ing snatch.

31:28.016 --> 31:29.757
This is ready to go.

31:29.757 --> 31:32.412
We're just going to use as many
hands as we can

31:32.412 --> 31:33.892
to get this to the table.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.155
Can you tell us the meal,
what it's about?

31:36.155 --> 31:39.375
Why would you ever
grab somebody's hair?

31:39.375 --> 31:42.161
You've got
beautiful truffle oil coated

31:42.161 --> 31:45.033
buffalo mozzarella
and fresh tomatoes.

31:45.033 --> 31:46.078
Superb.

31:48.645 --> 31:51.039
That looks absolutely stunning.

31:51.039 --> 31:52.649
It's amazing.
It's absolutely beautiful.

31:52.649 --> 31:54.129
I really appreciate people

31:54.129 --> 31:55.826
who could be like, oh yeah,
I had a really bad day

31:55.826 --> 31:57.480
and I'm sorry.
It wasn't my best moment.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.830
We're grown enough to not be
assholes at a certain age.

31:59.830 --> 32:01.441
I'm working on that.

32:01.441 --> 32:04.139
At a certain age you should
know not to be an asshole.

32:04.139 --> 32:06.054
- I stand by that.
- We are all human.

32:06.054 --> 32:08.622
We all make mistakes.
I messed up. I'm sorry.

32:08.622 --> 32:11.103
That smells like
heaven on earth.

32:11.103 --> 32:13.496
- Thank you, baby.
- Thanks.

32:15.803 --> 32:16.978
Ooh!
Voila!

32:20.634 --> 32:25.117
This evening, you have a risotto
done in like a Sicilian style

32:25.117 --> 32:26.596
with a trumpet mushroom sauté,

32:26.596 --> 32:28.903
with a little bit
of Sicilian olive oil.

32:28.903 --> 32:30.731
- Thank you.
- Everything has been delicious.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.211
All right, just go, bro.

32:32.211 --> 32:34.213
- You're going to bed?
- Are you going to stay?

32:34.213 --> 32:35.779
- Yeah.
- Game over for me.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.172
These are ready to roll.

32:37.172 --> 32:39.305
Look at that. But that
goes to the queen bee.

32:39.305 --> 32:40.915
Oh, so pretty.

32:40.915 --> 32:43.657
- For the queen bee yourself.
- Ladies!

32:43.657 --> 32:48.227
It is a vanilla honey
hannacata with fresh mangoes.

32:48.227 --> 32:51.621
Your details and
the presentation is... mwa.

32:51.621 --> 32:53.449
Not proud of myself
for this whole thing,

32:53.449 --> 32:55.451
but, I mean, it just
pulled off

32:55.451 --> 32:57.453
a truffle tasting menu
without truffle.

32:57.453 --> 32:59.020
Please enjoy.

33:00.195 --> 33:03.546
We resuscitated
this dinner service.

33:08.073 --> 33:09.552
Be on the floor at 6:30.

33:09.552 --> 33:12.164
- Go to bed now.
- I really appreciate that.

33:17.691 --> 33:18.997
I'm going to be up at seven.

33:20.476 --> 33:23.001
Can I get you any rose
or champagne, love?

33:23.871 --> 33:26.134
Cool.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.049
- I'm going to bed.
- Thank you.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.964
Okay, mate.

33:31.879 --> 33:33.533
Restocking the fridges
just real good.

33:33.533 --> 33:34.838
The glass bottles of sparkling.

33:34.838 --> 33:36.405
The glass bottles
of that fancy water.

33:36.405 --> 33:38.494
Make sure
there's just a champagne.

33:38.494 --> 33:41.541
There's no regard for
the amount of work I'm doing.

33:41.541 --> 33:44.848
Being a deck stew, everyone
sees me as not doing enough

33:44.848 --> 33:47.025
yet I'm doing twice the things.

33:47.025 --> 33:51.333
Yeah. Champs, whispering angels,
and one rose.

33:51.333 --> 33:52.378
And then...

33:52.378 --> 33:54.206
I feel like the
runt in the pack.

33:54.206 --> 33:56.512
I feel like the little baby
that can't get to the nipple.

33:56.512 --> 33:58.384
I got to run
this drink really quick.

34:02.518 --> 34:05.434
You want the shirt off?
I can take it off.

34:05.434 --> 34:06.696
What?

34:06.696 --> 34:09.047
This guy, right here,
with his shirt off.

34:21.146 --> 34:22.712
- Camille.
- Yes.

34:22.712 --> 34:24.584
Can you do this one down here?

34:24.584 --> 34:26.064
What is it?

34:26.064 --> 34:27.543
Girl, it's literally
what I told you to do.

34:31.417 --> 34:35.160
Do you see the space where
more bottles can go?

34:35.160 --> 34:38.424
- Oh, you wanted it...
- Full.

34:39.207 --> 34:40.600
- Full...
- Stocked.

34:40.600 --> 34:43.255
Stocked.

34:43.255 --> 34:46.562
If you have so much time to
walk around and do these checks,

34:46.562 --> 34:47.911
maybe you could grab it.

34:47.911 --> 34:49.565
I would love
to not check your work,

34:49.565 --> 34:52.090
but you're making me
check your work.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.266
Camille just doesn't
want to do her job,

34:54.266 --> 34:56.137
but she doesn't
want to be corrected,

34:56.137 --> 34:59.097
which is just childish.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.360
Five more sparkling.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.666
Five more sparkling waters.

35:05.494 --> 35:07.148
Good night, ladies.

35:09.803 --> 35:10.847
Whoa.

35:10.847 --> 35:12.110
Gonna go to bed.

35:12.110 --> 35:15.635
This is like girl,
like we're done.

35:15.635 --> 35:18.159
Everything is done
super yacht style?

35:18.159 --> 35:20.770
Super-Camille-yacht style
for sure.

35:20.770 --> 35:22.598
Yacht. All right. Good night.

35:23.773 --> 35:24.948
Jokes on me.

35:24.948 --> 35:26.950
All righty.

35:26.950 --> 35:29.475
Ha ha ha.
I'm losing my mind.

35:46.927 --> 35:48.146
Doctor.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.409
<i>Hey, captain.
How are you?</i>

35:50.409 --> 35:54.456
The problem I'm having, I've
lost all feeling in my left leg.

35:54.456 --> 35:57.894
It just gives out.
It won't support anything.

35:57.894 --> 36:00.419
<i>We definitely
need to figure this out.</i>

36:15.260 --> 36:17.218
I'm craving pizza lately.

36:18.741 --> 36:19.742
How are ya?

36:25.879 --> 36:28.795
There's nothing we can do right
now. Is any of the guests up?

36:28.795 --> 36:31.406
If they are awake by nine,
I would be very surprised

36:31.406 --> 36:33.147
because I wouldn't do
it if I was them.

36:33.147 --> 36:34.670
They didn't go to bed
until, like, 1:00.

36:34.670 --> 36:37.020
- I cannot do it.
- I was going delusional.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.544
I struggle with that sh--,
you know?

36:38.544 --> 36:41.329
I don't like it.
I really don't like it.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.679
It's like psychologically,
like torture.

36:43.679 --> 36:46.552
This is how I lose my mind.
I will lose my mind.

36:46.552 --> 36:51.034
I will get crampy. And then...
the dark side, you know?

36:52.427 --> 36:53.298
Coming up...

36:53.298 --> 36:55.169
We got cutlery and plates coming

36:55.169 --> 36:56.518
with the guests.

37:05.614 --> 37:10.489
God damn it.

37:10.489 --> 37:12.491
The weather's clearing up.

37:12.491 --> 37:13.753
We should be getting
the sun deck ready.

37:13.753 --> 37:14.971
Oh, yeah.
I should change.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.190
I see that you guys
wearing polos.

37:16.190 --> 37:18.192
T-shirts is off charter.

37:19.454 --> 37:21.282
- All right, see you there.
- We've got no guests up,

37:21.282 --> 37:22.979
but everything's set up,
ready to go.

37:22.979 --> 37:24.546
So if you want to
let me know what you're

37:24.546 --> 37:25.808
doing for breakfast,
then we'll just go from there.

37:25.808 --> 37:27.201
Our usual.

37:27.201 --> 37:29.159
Never had so many uniforms
in my entire life.

37:29.159 --> 37:31.901
So excited.
I cannot hide the happiness.

37:31.901 --> 37:33.294
I can feel the vibes.

37:33.294 --> 37:34.513
There's something different
this morning.

37:34.513 --> 37:36.906
Like a disturbance
in the force.

37:36.906 --> 37:39.344
I don't think Tony's realize
what yachting's all about.

37:43.130 --> 37:45.175
It's a mother----er
and it will get you.

37:49.919 --> 37:51.181
Good morning.
Good morning.

37:51.181 --> 37:53.401
Can I get some wellness
shots for you too?

37:53.401 --> 37:54.402
Sure.

37:54.402 --> 37:56.317
Checking in on the laundo.

37:56.317 --> 37:58.754
What do we have done?
Here we go.

38:00.365 --> 38:01.540
Oh, that's disgusting.

38:05.544 --> 38:07.110
You know,
I still feel like I'm going

38:07.110 --> 38:09.852
to go down there
and steal some snacks.

38:09.852 --> 38:11.550
Thank you.

38:14.030 --> 38:16.468
I can go to the beach at
1:30 with Camille.

38:16.468 --> 38:18.426
Right. I'll start
getting stuff over there.

38:18.426 --> 38:20.472
I love hot pink.
I used to never wear pink

38:20.472 --> 38:22.648
and now I'm like
I buy lots of pink stuff.

38:22.648 --> 38:25.520
- Laundry complete.
- Right. Go take your break.

38:28.784 --> 38:30.351
- Does that work?
- Yeah.

38:30.351 --> 38:32.310
So you and Tony are going
to be on the beach to start.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.660
Probably best if
you're in your wet clothes.

38:42.102 --> 38:44.713
Interior, interior, I'm ready
for someone to be on standby

38:44.713 --> 38:46.541
to take these up in one minute.
Not even.

38:46.541 --> 38:48.413
I'm going to
the beach shortly and

38:48.413 --> 38:51.285
then I'm going to swap
out with Alissa.

38:51.285 --> 38:53.374
What I need you to do is
be in charge with Rachel

38:53.374 --> 38:54.593
because I'm not going
to be there to run the service.

38:54.593 --> 38:56.203
You're going to
run the whole thing.

38:56.203 --> 38:58.510
Okay, copy that.
I'd love to do a beach picnic.

38:58.510 --> 39:00.425
I wasn't supposed
to have this whole thing

39:00.425 --> 39:02.557
- but it just happened. Okay?
- It's too moist.

39:02.557 --> 39:03.950
You can't stop.

39:03.950 --> 39:05.865
Watch your feet, because
it's still going to go up.

39:07.083 --> 39:09.869
- Whatever.
- All right.

39:09.869 --> 39:11.392
- Looks delicious.
- Start with this, and

39:11.392 --> 39:13.351
I'll bring you some more
cutlery as well.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.135
- Perfect. Thank you.
- Pleasure.

39:19.052 --> 39:20.401
Didn't eat dinner Last night.

39:20.401 --> 39:22.751
Camille, can I borrow you
for five minutes?

39:22.751 --> 39:24.797
Just trying
to put it up real quick.

39:28.801 --> 39:30.324
I'm on deck right now.

39:30.324 --> 39:33.632
I just want to make that clear.
You're not my boss.

39:33.632 --> 39:35.590
That's the lazy sh--
I'm talking about.

39:35.590 --> 39:38.637
- Here's your bacon.
- Yes.

39:40.639 --> 39:42.075
Is she my boss?

39:42.075 --> 39:44.730
I'm on deck right now.
But you're running your mouth.

39:47.341 --> 39:49.691
You could just give
me five to seven minutes.

39:49.691 --> 39:51.780
Oh, that's gorgeous.
With that light?

39:51.780 --> 39:53.478
The lighting is just...

39:56.872 --> 39:59.135
Two platters,
but one for your halibut.

39:59.135 --> 40:00.833
- Yes.
- I've got one for your chicken.

40:00.833 --> 40:02.225
Guys, this is too much.

40:02.225 --> 40:03.966
I can't go back to my day
to day life now.

40:03.966 --> 40:05.881
Like, how am I supposed
to live normally now?

40:08.884 --> 40:10.103
Thanks, mate.

40:10.103 --> 40:11.147
Let me know
if you need anything.

40:11.147 --> 40:12.453
Yeah, I will.

40:12.453 --> 40:13.454
Put a table here
because they're going

40:13.454 --> 40:14.977
to want to eat in the shade.

40:14.977 --> 40:17.153
Okay. So I'll bring
one of the tables over here.

40:17.153 --> 40:19.286
Yeah, so we'll
just do two on each end.

40:19.286 --> 40:21.810
- Okay.
- That is great.

40:21.810 --> 40:24.247
Can I draw a penis on there?
Yeah, you can if you want.

40:24.247 --> 40:25.597
It would be funny.

40:25.597 --> 40:28.121
Zhuzhing it up with a cock.

40:28.121 --> 40:29.122
He's in.

40:29.122 --> 40:30.428
- I know.
- Yes.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.213
Finally, a time to
have fun, to relax,

40:33.213 --> 40:36.216
to actually enjoy
this beautiful place.

40:46.531 --> 40:48.446
I think we've done
a marvelous job, kiddos.

40:48.446 --> 40:51.840
- I think we did, too.
- And you got it.

40:51.840 --> 40:54.016
You made me proud.
Thanks, guys. Good luck.

40:54.016 --> 40:55.583
Hey, buddy.

40:55.583 --> 40:57.280
Go ahead and get changed now,
because the next trip is

40:57.280 --> 40:59.413
your trip to the beach.
Yeah?

40:59.413 --> 41:02.895
Oh, let's see this
deckhand abilities.

41:02.895 --> 41:04.070
All right.

41:04.070 --> 41:05.463
This is life.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.900
I need to, like, refreshen up.

41:18.737 --> 41:21.566
Can I please get
a copy on the coolers?

41:24.569 --> 41:26.527
I could have a glass of wine,
but I keep feeling

41:26.527 --> 41:27.789
we're going to leave.
We're not leaving.

41:27.789 --> 41:29.356
I don't know where
the coolers are.

41:29.356 --> 41:30.618
I never heard anything
about the coolers.

41:38.887 --> 41:41.977
They're in the lockerette
by the ice machine.

41:45.024 --> 41:46.329
Oh, no.

41:49.811 --> 41:52.422
You cannot send the guests
without those cooler.

41:52.422 --> 41:53.511
God damn it.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.600
Don't make a big deal about it.

41:55.600 --> 41:59.473
This is absurd, but I think
I've been a little bit too kind.

42:01.475 --> 42:03.564
I can't just be Mr. Nice Guy.

42:03.564 --> 42:06.567
I need to put my foot
down here and stop this.

42:06.567 --> 42:08.482
I'm going to
have to be that bitch.

42:13.966 --> 42:15.315
Was there wine in it?

42:17.099 --> 42:19.667
Wow. I bet they're
right where I said they were.

42:24.977 --> 42:26.631
Next on Below Deck...

42:31.157 --> 42:32.593
- Can I touch your hair?
- Yeah, sure.

42:32.593 --> 42:34.377
I've been wanting to do
that for a long time.

42:34.377 --> 42:35.944
Yeah?

42:37.163 --> 42:39.034
No. It ain't----ing lukewarm.

42:42.951 --> 42:44.170
That's super----ed up.

42:44.170 --> 42:46.346
And I'm not going to
- ing look at that.

42:53.571 --> 42:56.704
My mind's there,
my heart's there.

42:56.704 --> 42:58.184
My body just won't cooperate.

42:58.184 --> 42:59.315
Ah!

42:59.315 --> 43:01.709
So I made a decision.
