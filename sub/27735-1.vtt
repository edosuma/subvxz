Subtitles by explosiveskull

02:51.537 --> 02:53.337
<i>...guns fired.</i>

02:53.339 --> 02:56.874
<i>Multiple officers down.
Wilcock Road.</i>

02:56.876 --> 02:57.874
<i>Immediate assistance.</i>

02:57.876 --> 03:00.945
<i>I repeat,
multiple officers down.</i>

03:00.947 --> 03:04.348
<i>Heavy armed gunmen
opened fire...</i>

03:17.462 --> 03:18.561
I heard it.

03:18.563 --> 03:19.465
<i>What time you got?</i>

03:22.001 --> 03:23.301
6:21.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.405
<i>Just be here by 6:30.
Nothing but the radio.</i>

04:16.422 --> 04:17.322
That's soothing.

04:18.423 --> 04:19.325
Inside.

04:46.217 --> 04:47.718
Where are the others?

04:47.720 --> 04:48.587
They're on their way.

05:12.311 --> 05:13.276
About 30 minutes ago,

05:13.278 --> 05:15.244
a gunman opened fire
at a crowd of people.

05:15.246 --> 05:16.646
I don't know who,
I don't know why,

05:16.648 --> 05:18.482
I don't know where.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.550
But I know
the rifle was automatic.

05:20.552 --> 05:21.518
What's the news say?

05:21.520 --> 05:23.586
Public shooter,
multiple fatalities.

05:23.588 --> 05:24.356
That's all so far.

05:27.126 --> 05:28.525
Do they know whose it was?

05:28.527 --> 05:30.093
- Whose what was?
- A man walked out of the woods

05:30.095 --> 05:31.528
with an automatic weapon

05:31.530 --> 05:33.364
and started shooting on
a funeral at Wilcock Cemetery.

05:33.366 --> 05:34.665
Do they know whose it was?

05:34.667 --> 05:36.100
On a funeral?

05:36.102 --> 05:36.766
That's what I said.

05:40.338 --> 05:41.771
- He got away.
- Who?

05:41.773 --> 05:43.439
The shooter.
The shooter got away.

05:43.441 --> 05:45.309
- He didn't kill himself?
- No!

05:45.311 --> 05:46.710
What does that
have to do with anything?

05:46.712 --> 05:48.078
Public shooters
usually realize

05:48.080 --> 05:49.612
how badly they fucked up
once they finish.

05:49.614 --> 05:51.514
They also realize the solution
to that feeling,

05:51.516 --> 05:52.583
it's in their hands.

05:52.585 --> 05:54.650
It doesn't matter.
He's still alive.

05:54.652 --> 05:57.153
My bet is, the cops don't even
know where the shooter is.

05:57.155 --> 05:58.189
They're still
searching the area.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.490
Helicopters, ground units,
dogs, door-to-door.

06:00.492 --> 06:01.359
That's not
going to do anything.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.292
There's enough leaves
in the trees.

06:02.294 --> 06:03.460
It'll will cover him
from the Heli units

06:03.462 --> 06:05.498
and the dogs, they don't pick up
the scents or anything.

06:08.566 --> 06:10.367
What do you know?

06:10.369 --> 06:12.335
A guy walked
out of the woods,

06:12.337 --> 06:15.641
opened fire on a funeral
with an AR-15.

06:17.342 --> 06:20.410
- What?
- AR-15 automatic rifle,

06:20.412 --> 06:23.814
body armor, grenades,
flash bangs,

06:23.816 --> 06:27.184
IEDs planted on
the surrounding headstones.

06:27.186 --> 06:29.119
Military grade everything.

06:29.121 --> 06:30.487
You're confident
on the AR part?

06:30.489 --> 06:32.388
Heard it on the news.

06:32.390 --> 06:33.424
I don't think
the news realizes

06:33.426 --> 06:36.160
that AR-15's bought off
the rack are semiauto.

06:36.162 --> 06:37.393
- So?
- The gun was automatic.

06:37.395 --> 06:38.595
I heard it.

06:38.597 --> 06:40.763
You heard a modified AR.

06:40.765 --> 06:43.236
Okay. So correct me
if I'm wrong, but now...

06:44.669 --> 06:46.502
aren't we the only people
that have those?

06:46.504 --> 06:49.206
ARs are legal.
Auto-kits are gettable.

06:49.208 --> 06:50.210
It was the cops.

06:52.544 --> 06:54.410
Cops funeral.
Cop in the casket.

06:54.412 --> 06:56.312
Cop in attendance.

06:56.314 --> 06:58.648
The IED shrapnel
took out most of them.

06:58.650 --> 07:00.484
More on their way
to St John's.

07:00.486 --> 07:01.485
Jesus Christ!

07:01.487 --> 07:02.388
This boring you?

07:06.191 --> 07:07.059
What'd you hear,
Keating?

07:09.794 --> 07:10.761
Right.
Can we not waste time

07:10.763 --> 07:11.694
waiting for 'Chief' to speak?

07:23.676 --> 07:24.577
Well, Noah?

07:27.278 --> 07:28.845
They're saying the shooter
on the cop funeral

07:28.847 --> 07:30.383
was a militia man.

07:33.451 --> 07:35.184
How'd they ID him as that?

07:35.186 --> 07:36.319
It doesn't matter
how they IDed him,

07:36.321 --> 07:37.754
what matters is,
they announced it.

07:37.756 --> 07:39.889
So a militia man
just shot up a police funeral

07:39.891 --> 07:40.857
and the remaining cops,

07:40.859 --> 07:42.525
and the inevitable
military reinforcements

07:42.527 --> 07:46.232
are searching for... us.

07:50.768 --> 07:52.602
That's what
they're saying.

07:52.604 --> 07:55.304
Then we shouldn't
let that happen.

07:55.306 --> 07:56.639
Well put,
we need to leave.

07:56.641 --> 07:58.275
What the fuck
are we still doing here?

07:58.277 --> 07:59.746
- Let's back up.
- No. Don't go anywhere.

08:02.248 --> 08:05.249
Cops already know there's
militia presence in the area.

08:05.251 --> 08:06.786
They've got checkpoints up.
Patrol cars.

08:08.787 --> 08:10.657
That call went out 10 minutes
after the first shot went off.

08:12.357 --> 08:15.158
National Guard reinforcement's
going to get brought in.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.559
Their undersized police force

08:16.561 --> 08:18.427
with not enough cops
or cars to put them in

08:18.429 --> 08:21.732
become a decent size army
with military grade weapons.

08:21.734 --> 08:24.268
Not enough lumber warehouses
to check.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.737
Okay, fine.
We call the cops.

08:26.739 --> 08:27.705
Say that we didn't do it.

08:27.707 --> 08:29.939
You want to
bring them over here?

08:29.941 --> 08:33.943
We have AR-15s, bump stocks,
armor piercing rounds, grenades.

08:33.946 --> 08:35.410
We're militia with intent,

08:35.413 --> 08:37.280
and each one of us here
is going to do 20 years.

08:37.282 --> 08:38.448
Look, you got a point,
or you just want to tell me

08:38.450 --> 08:39.515
how fucked I am?

08:39.518 --> 08:40.582
Look, I'm just saying

08:40.585 --> 08:42.184
that maybe we should
just stay put.

08:42.187 --> 08:44.887
- Until when?
- Until they find the shooter.

08:44.889 --> 08:46.356
And if he's on foot,
that'll be quick enough.

08:46.358 --> 08:47.491
You guys got phones on you?

08:47.493 --> 08:49.859
Standard practice is to check up
on every militia member.

08:49.861 --> 08:52.328
So I guarantee you
they've pinged all our phones.

08:52.330 --> 08:53.729
Yeah.
Batteries out now.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.900
No TV. No Internet.

08:56.902 --> 08:57.767
What now?

08:57.769 --> 08:59.069
Let's clear out the armory.

08:59.071 --> 09:01.771
We should get rid of anything
that can link us to a shooting.

09:01.773 --> 09:02.741
Let's do it now.

09:28.533 --> 09:29.434
One's missing.

09:38.476 --> 09:39.378
Where's nine?

09:44.483 --> 09:45.385
Who's got it?

09:55.661 --> 09:57.961
They said he was wearing Kevlar.

09:57.963 --> 09:59.599
We're supposed to have 25.
How many?

10:02.801 --> 10:04.434
Fewer than that.

10:04.436 --> 10:05.535
Grenades,
last time I counted,

10:05.537 --> 10:07.337
we had two cases, 48.

10:07.339 --> 10:09.772
Safe to say
we're several short.

10:09.774 --> 10:12.608
The keypad on that door
has a self-changing combination

10:12.610 --> 10:14.477
every 48 hours.

10:14.479 --> 10:15.812
The only people
aware of that combination

10:15.814 --> 10:16.716
are in this room.

10:19.051 --> 10:19.953
One of you did it.

10:27.058 --> 10:27.993
Please...

10:30.829 --> 10:31.830
just man up.

10:35.533 --> 10:38.403
Save us some pain...
and say you did it.

10:43.075 --> 10:45.942
Do it, or I'll radio the cops,
give them our position.

10:45.944 --> 10:47.044
Are you
out of your mind?

10:47.046 --> 10:48.511
If I don't give up who did it

10:48.513 --> 10:49.681
and they find us,
we all go down.

10:51.316 --> 10:52.683
Which one of you did it?

10:52.685 --> 10:53.583
Why would anyone do that?

10:53.585 --> 10:55.419
Why would he shoot up
a bunch of cops

10:55.421 --> 10:56.819
and then come back here?

10:56.821 --> 10:59.088
Arsonists like to
watch their work from a crowd.

10:59.090 --> 11:00.924
This isn't much different.

11:00.926 --> 11:02.391
Where were you?

11:02.393 --> 11:03.328
Me?

11:04.629 --> 11:06.829
- I was at work.
- Where were you?

11:06.831 --> 11:08.865
McNeil's Bar.
What else?

11:08.867 --> 11:09.535
Where were you?

11:11.003 --> 11:13.636
- On a hunt.
- Prove it.

11:13.638 --> 11:16.508
There's a still warm eight-point
buck in my truck bed.

11:17.909 --> 11:18.810
Where were you?

11:21.046 --> 11:22.415
Fuckin' sign or something?

11:23.782 --> 11:26.349
- Huh?
- I was at the range.

11:26.351 --> 11:28.017
The guy working there
sold me like 100 rounds

11:28.019 --> 11:29.685
probably 30 minutes ago.

11:29.687 --> 11:30.590
And you?

11:32.624 --> 11:34.924
How do we know it's not you?

11:34.926 --> 11:38.362
How are we sure this isn't some
'old cop attacks his own' shit?

11:38.364 --> 11:39.896
I was hunting.

11:39.898 --> 11:42.366
- The truck's outside.
- So is mine. So what?

11:42.368 --> 11:43.534
I'm assuming
you've hunted once in your life;

11:43.536 --> 11:46.069
you know the kill bleeds out
in the back of your truck.

11:46.071 --> 11:47.103
Why don't you go outside
and take a look?

11:47.105 --> 11:48.804
I haven't hosed it down...

11:48.806 --> 11:50.073
Both you and Hubbel
have dead game in your truck.

11:50.075 --> 11:50.973
A little convenient.

11:50.975 --> 11:53.142
Not really.
It is deer season.

11:53.144 --> 11:54.511
So you're not a suspect

11:54.513 --> 11:56.713
because your car's
covered in blood.

11:56.715 --> 11:57.848
If I wanted to kill
a bunch of cops,

11:57.850 --> 11:58.948
and then come here and hide,

11:58.950 --> 12:00.650
is because I want to
get away with it.

12:00.652 --> 12:01.918
If I want to get away with it,

12:01.920 --> 12:03.753
why would I leave blood
in the back of my truck?

12:03.755 --> 12:04.820
And if I want to kill
a bunch of cops

12:04.822 --> 12:05.789
and get away with it,

12:05.791 --> 12:06.890
I'm not putting the dead ones
in the back.

12:06.892 --> 12:11.060
An old cop hermit
living in the woods snaps.

12:11.062 --> 12:12.027
All of a sudden,
there's a shooting,

12:12.029 --> 12:15.732
and his cover was hunting!

12:15.734 --> 12:17.032
And we're the ones
left to explain

12:17.034 --> 12:18.801
why we let him in
in the first place.

12:18.803 --> 12:21.003
Because four militias
got taken down last year

12:21.005 --> 12:25.141
by infiltrating UC's,
and he keeps us clean.

12:25.143 --> 12:27.080
So unless you have
something of use to say...

12:30.516 --> 12:32.549
no one leaves here
until I find out who did it.

12:33.951 --> 12:36.420
How are you planning
on doing that?

12:36.422 --> 12:37.389
He's gonna question you.

12:39.725 --> 12:41.857
Our only option
is to prove our innocence

12:41.859 --> 12:43.193
that it was a lone gunman.

12:43.195 --> 12:45.694
You say no,
and we all go to war

12:45.696 --> 12:47.066
because one of us
has lost his mind.

12:51.736 --> 12:52.704
I'm going to need a baseline.

12:55.072 --> 12:57.607
- How tall are you?
- Go fuck yourself.

12:57.609 --> 12:58.775
How much do you weigh?

12:58.777 --> 13:00.577
Hard.

13:00.579 --> 13:01.977
Did you do it, Morris?

13:01.979 --> 13:03.148
Really fuckin' hard.

13:05.683 --> 13:06.750
Where were you before this?

13:06.752 --> 13:08.651
- At my job.
- Which is?

13:08.653 --> 13:11.087
At school.
Grading papers.

13:11.089 --> 13:12.923
I'm sorry,
why are you asking me questions

13:12.925 --> 13:14.591
that you already
know the answer to?

13:14.593 --> 13:15.625
Where are you from?

13:15.627 --> 13:17.227
Michigan, originally.

13:17.229 --> 13:18.962
How tall are you?

13:18.964 --> 13:20.997
5'3.

13:20.999 --> 13:23.132
When is the last time
you measured yourself?

13:23.134 --> 13:24.503
Ms. Wilson's class.

13:27.873 --> 13:28.775
When is your birthday?

13:30.108 --> 13:30.977
What's your favorite color?

13:32.845 --> 13:33.845
Can you see color?

13:35.614 --> 13:36.516
Did you do it?

13:40.219 --> 13:41.251
Where were you before this?

13:41.253 --> 13:42.486
I was at the range.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.687
What time
did you get there?

13:43.689 --> 13:44.987
I don't know.
4:30 maybe.

13:44.989 --> 13:46.055
I didn't look at the clock.

13:46.057 --> 13:47.623
Why didn't you
return my texts?

13:47.625 --> 13:49.125
I didn't have my phone.

13:49.127 --> 13:52.862
Noah, does anybody
in this militia

13:52.864 --> 13:53.799
know that you're a cop?

13:58.503 --> 13:59.438
I don't know.

14:01.005 --> 14:02.572
Any others inside?

14:02.574 --> 14:03.772
I don't know.
I don't think so.

14:03.774 --> 14:05.674
I don't know for sure.

14:05.676 --> 14:07.611
I don't know who anyone is
or what the hell happened.

14:07.613 --> 14:11.113
- I've just... I was.
- Shhh. Relax.

14:11.115 --> 14:12.018
I'm relaxed.

14:15.753 --> 14:16.819
What are you doing?

14:16.821 --> 14:18.288
- You can't do that.
- No, it's on the phone now.

14:18.290 --> 14:19.990
Once I turn this on,
the cops will trace it.

14:19.992 --> 14:21.724
They'll be here
in 10 minutes.

14:21.726 --> 14:22.758
Wait, wait, Gannon, don't...

14:22.760 --> 14:23.595
I'm gonna tell them
you did it.

14:25.196 --> 14:27.232
What are you...
what are you talking about?

14:29.734 --> 14:32.135
You got them to buy
your armor piercing rounds

14:32.137 --> 14:34.103
for the AR-15s,
you did your job.

14:34.105 --> 14:36.006
I'm gonna tell them it was you.

14:36.008 --> 14:38.007
You're going to tell them
who you are.

14:38.009 --> 14:39.041
And you're going
to get confirmed

14:39.043 --> 14:39.476
by your superior.

14:39.478 --> 14:41.711
Wait. Just wait.

14:41.713 --> 14:43.549
My superior was at the funeral.

14:46.118 --> 14:47.052
Marlowe.

14:48.287 --> 14:50.152
The only one who knew
I was undercover.

14:50.154 --> 14:52.588
They said his name on the radio.

14:52.590 --> 14:55.324
He was at the funeral.
He's gone.

14:55.326 --> 14:56.726
If you send me back there,

14:56.728 --> 14:59.596
they'll kill me
just like they would you.

14:59.598 --> 15:01.564
Please, Gannon,
I can't go back.

15:05.170 --> 15:07.073
Who's running UC's
at the 47th Precinct?

15:09.941 --> 15:12.007
- Kowalski.
- And you have a distress call

15:12.009 --> 15:13.144
in case you need extraction,
right?

15:14.979 --> 15:16.947
Hotel Charlie Echo.

15:16.949 --> 15:18.814
Would he know that?

15:18.816 --> 15:20.317
I don't know. Maybe.

15:20.319 --> 15:22.618
Okay.

15:22.620 --> 15:24.788
Okay.
Here's what we're gonna do.

15:24.790 --> 15:26.589
I'm gonna find out who did it,

15:26.591 --> 15:29.325
and we're going to prove it,
and then we get you outta here.

15:29.327 --> 15:31.361
Okay?

15:31.363 --> 15:33.597
Make sure they confess
on tape somehow,

15:33.599 --> 15:35.165
otherwise we have nothing.

15:35.167 --> 15:37.266
I narrowed it down to two.

15:37.268 --> 15:39.102
Then pick two.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.038
Morris.

15:41.940 --> 15:43.205
- Is this a joke?
- No.

15:43.207 --> 15:46.141
But if you have nothing to hide,
you have nothing to worry about.

15:46.143 --> 15:48.211
Okay, you said two.

15:48.213 --> 15:49.115
Keating.

15:50.816 --> 15:54.083
Hubbel, take Morris
downstairs to the basement.

15:54.085 --> 15:55.952
- Tie him to a chair.
- Put a hand on me,

15:55.954 --> 15:58.324
I'll pull you in by it
and crush your fuckin' skull.

16:00.359 --> 16:01.857
Hubbel, you keep
this trained on his chest

16:01.859 --> 16:03.863
from 10 feet away
in case he moves.

16:06.764 --> 16:08.167
- Let's go.
- Keys.

16:15.840 --> 16:18.210
Keating, do you want to
make this easy on me?

16:30.088 --> 16:32.722
Take Noah out back
and tie him to the fence.

16:32.724 --> 16:33.890
I didn't say Noah.

16:33.892 --> 16:35.424
I was at the range.

16:35.426 --> 16:37.694
I was thinking about that.
The range is 20 minutes away.

16:37.696 --> 16:39.161
You were here 10 minutes
after I called you.

16:39.163 --> 16:40.362
- Where were you?
- I was at the range.

16:40.364 --> 16:42.399
I swear to God.

16:42.401 --> 16:43.769
Do you know
what you're doing?

16:45.436 --> 16:46.368
You really think
you're in a position

16:46.370 --> 16:47.872
to question me, Gannon?

16:50.142 --> 16:52.074
Bring the federal lamp outside
when you're done.

16:52.076 --> 16:53.242
We need eyes on the road.

16:53.244 --> 16:54.176
Does your foreman still fish?

16:54.178 --> 16:55.411
Is his gear here?

16:55.413 --> 16:57.046
What has that got to do
with anything?

16:57.048 --> 16:58.213
Well, I can
convert the fish finder

16:58.215 --> 16:59.748
to pick up radio signals.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.785
We'll know if anybody
with a CB radio is near us.

17:01.787 --> 17:03.752
And I can convert the CB radio
over to LS signals

17:03.754 --> 17:05.186
so that we can dodge traces.

17:05.189 --> 17:06.423
I don't understand.

17:06.425 --> 17:07.757
All right.
I can do a bunch of stuff

17:07.759 --> 17:08.589
so the cops won't find us,

17:08.592 --> 17:09.392
and we'll know
if they're near us.

17:09.394 --> 17:10.291
- Then do that.
- Good.

17:10.294 --> 17:12.060
And then, go to
the comm room afterwards

17:12.063 --> 17:13.996
and contact
the other militias nearby.

17:13.998 --> 17:15.865
- Tell 'em what?
- Tell 'em we didn't do it.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.701
Then bringing the cars
to the loading dock.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.001
Keys, both of you now.

17:19.002 --> 17:20.868
- Beck.
- Yeah.

17:20.871 --> 17:21.738
- When you're on the CB,

17:21.740 --> 17:23.338
if you hear of a cop
named Kowalski,

17:23.339 --> 17:26.242
you say this to him twice.
He's a friend of mine.

17:26.243 --> 17:27.944
- What does it mean?
- It means stand down.

17:27.945 --> 17:29.381
We have the situation
under control.

17:31.483 --> 17:32.848
All right.

17:47.799 --> 17:50.733
How long does something
like this usually take?

17:50.735 --> 17:53.802
Hours.
Days sometimes.

17:53.804 --> 17:56.241
Okay.
You got neither. Get going.

18:20.465 --> 18:22.268
Did you bring that deer
to your truck on your own?

18:24.034 --> 18:25.801
Mm-hmm.

18:25.803 --> 18:27.436
Can you bring it down here?

18:27.438 --> 18:28.773
Okay.

19:00.038 --> 19:02.838
Hey, how are you doing?

19:02.840 --> 19:04.374
You're right.
I'm so sorry about this.

19:04.376 --> 19:07.042
I'd to bring you down here
because I think it's Keating.

19:07.044 --> 19:08.811
And if I don't have Keating
relaxed and thinking

19:08.813 --> 19:12.014
he's going to get away with it,
then the whole thing is shot.

19:12.016 --> 19:14.184
And why am I
still tied to a chair?

19:14.186 --> 19:16.021
It's got to look like
I really interrogated you.

19:18.156 --> 19:19.457
Once sec, don't go anywhere.

19:22.994 --> 19:24.196
How are those zip ties?

19:25.397 --> 19:26.829
Are they too tight?

19:26.831 --> 19:28.330
You better speak up now

19:28.332 --> 19:30.835
because if your circulation
gets cut off, you are fucked.

19:33.839 --> 19:34.738
I'd untie you myself,

19:34.740 --> 19:38.007
but we got to
keep the appearances up

19:38.009 --> 19:39.311
just in case
someone comes down here.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.081
Cops deserved it,
if you ask me.

19:55.392 --> 19:56.461
I knew it when I was a cop.

19:58.362 --> 20:00.195
It's only a matter of time.

20:00.197 --> 20:02.932
- Ticking clock.
- Yeah.

20:02.934 --> 20:04.369
I still remember
what you said to me.

20:06.303 --> 20:08.006
The night I joined this militia,

20:10.175 --> 20:14.277
you said, "One day, someone's
going to snap on you people.

20:14.279 --> 20:15.878
Kill every one of you."

20:21.386 --> 20:23.353
And then you said,
"I might be the one to do it."

20:23.355 --> 20:24.921
Pretty good memory you got.

20:24.923 --> 20:26.255
It was a pretty
memorable thing to say.

20:26.257 --> 20:27.656
You're telling me
I'm the only person

20:27.658 --> 20:29.492
who's thinking that
at a militia meeting?

20:29.494 --> 20:31.293
No, I think everyone
here feels the same way.

20:31.295 --> 20:32.928
- Including you.
- Including me.

20:32.930 --> 20:34.563
And yet,
I'm tied to this chair

20:34.565 --> 20:37.035
and you're free
to be over there.

20:47.544 --> 20:48.912
This hypothetical situation

20:48.914 --> 20:51.915
you threatened me with
a year ago,

20:51.917 --> 20:54.149
that actually happened tonight.

20:54.151 --> 20:56.154
So we're not just
keeping up appearances, are we?

20:58.990 --> 20:59.959
No.

21:15.372 --> 21:16.407
All right.
Thank you.

21:23.247 --> 21:24.213
This is the part
where you ask me

21:24.215 --> 21:25.982
why I hate cops so much?

21:25.984 --> 21:27.349
When you took
a psych evaluation

21:27.351 --> 21:29.018
when you got your discharge
from the Corps,

21:29.020 --> 21:31.119
turns out you have a fear
of authoritative figures

21:31.121 --> 21:32.523
due to your abusive father.

21:36.561 --> 21:38.560
The truth is,
my job is to profile.

21:38.562 --> 21:40.530
Because of the situation
and lack of time,

21:40.532 --> 21:42.100
let's just assume
you are the shooter.

21:45.235 --> 21:48.203
Late 40's, early 50's.

21:48.205 --> 21:49.571
Now I can't see
the clover leaf tattoo,

21:49.573 --> 21:51.707
but I'm assuming it is there

21:51.709 --> 21:53.311
because you are
ex Aryan Nations.

21:55.312 --> 21:58.481
The person sitting in your seat
has two choices.

21:58.483 --> 22:01.184
Confession or denial.

22:01.186 --> 22:04.386
What makes your circumstance
so special

22:04.388 --> 22:06.521
is that if you confess to me,

22:06.523 --> 22:09.492
I'm gonna run upstairs
and I'm gonna radio the news,

22:09.494 --> 22:12.028
which means you're public.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.062
People are gonna know your name.

22:14.064 --> 22:15.999
People are gonna know
why you did it.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.166
There's going to be a trial,

22:18.168 --> 22:19.304
and then you're
going to go to jail.

22:21.005 --> 22:25.674
But in your case,
jail as a punishment is defense,

22:25.676 --> 22:27.042
because if you don't
confess to me

22:27.044 --> 22:28.511
right here, right now,

22:28.513 --> 22:31.250
the cops come and get you,
and if the cops find you...

22:33.318 --> 22:34.716
sure as water's wet
and time ticks,

22:34.718 --> 22:36.452
you get no trial.

22:36.454 --> 22:38.387
You're not going to jail.

22:38.389 --> 22:43.091
You get tortured
within an inch of your life,

22:43.093 --> 22:45.060
and then you just disappear.

22:45.062 --> 22:46.729
That's it.
Nobody knows your name.

22:46.731 --> 22:48.364
Nobody knows why you did it,

22:48.366 --> 22:50.732
and nobody knows
why you martyred yourself.

22:50.734 --> 22:52.670
People are just going to ask,
what happened to that guy?

22:56.041 --> 22:57.976
I don't know. Well...

23:00.311 --> 23:01.480
I already know you did it.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.149
I just wonder why you did it.

23:06.684 --> 23:07.716
And think about this,

23:07.718 --> 23:09.051
the reason
you're gagging right now

23:09.053 --> 23:10.653
and I'm fine with the smell

23:10.655 --> 23:12.523
is just to let you know
I'm not lying.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.562
That's it?

23:20.564 --> 23:24.299
You know I did it 'cause of
something I said a year ago.

23:24.301 --> 23:25.768
Buddy, you got no evidence.

23:25.770 --> 23:26.735
You're an ex-member

23:26.737 --> 23:28.570
of the Jackson Aryan
Brotherhood, correct?

23:28.572 --> 23:29.771
- Yeah.
- They were responsible

23:29.773 --> 23:31.374
for six cop murders
in three years.

23:31.376 --> 23:32.341
It doesn't mean I did 'em.

23:32.343 --> 23:34.342
You have experience
dismantling improvised

23:34.344 --> 23:35.711
explosive devices in Iraq.

23:35.713 --> 23:38.213
Dismantling, not making,
you fuckin' genius.

23:38.215 --> 23:39.449
The best way to learn
how to make some things

23:39.451 --> 23:40.384
is to take it apart.

23:40.386 --> 23:42.350
You got an affinity
for assault rifles,

23:42.352 --> 23:44.419
and then that little
inadvertent admission to me,

23:44.421 --> 23:46.588
an ex-cop, that you were
thinking about an attack

23:46.590 --> 23:48.691
a year ago that just happened
to happen tonight.

23:48.693 --> 23:51.293
So you see, evidence
really isn't an issue,

23:51.295 --> 23:53.796
but you see what happens
if you deny this.

23:53.798 --> 23:55.665
You and whatever,
whoever you care about,

23:55.667 --> 23:59.101
they become a stain
on the basement floor.

23:59.103 --> 24:00.371
I want to help you avoid that.

24:03.108 --> 24:04.009
Even if I did it...

24:06.410 --> 24:08.379
why is it that you think
I would've done it?

24:09.813 --> 24:13.215
Aryan Nation
is blood in, blood out.

24:13.217 --> 24:14.151
If you'd the balls to leave,

24:14.153 --> 24:15.721
they probably came after you
pretty hard.

24:17.754 --> 24:18.823
But they don't threaten you
with death.

24:21.391 --> 24:23.358
They come and they try to
destroy everything you love.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.728
Everybody you know.

24:25.730 --> 24:28.664
I'm pretty sure you would go
to extremes to avoid that.

24:28.666 --> 24:31.233
You went after the people
they hate the most.

24:31.235 --> 24:32.734
You get back
in their good graces.

24:32.736 --> 24:34.770
Are you serious?

24:34.772 --> 24:37.373
I'm the moron ex-Aryan bro
looking to get busted.

24:37.375 --> 24:38.875
That's the best you can do?

24:38.877 --> 24:40.675
Yeah, that's it.
Fuck, you got me, man.

24:40.677 --> 24:43.546
- I am spooked.
- Phew!

24:43.548 --> 24:44.513
I was terrified.

24:44.515 --> 24:47.149
They were going to kill me.
I was desperate.

24:47.151 --> 24:49.152
Scared as a lost little girl.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.089
That was it right there.

24:52.357 --> 24:53.792
Why did you do that?
Why do you use that word?

24:56.394 --> 24:57.429
I know your whole history.

24:59.397 --> 25:00.596
Aryan phase,
let's call it that.

25:00.598 --> 25:02.764
You had all these priors.

25:02.766 --> 25:06.702
Conspire B&E, conspire to sell,
and then it was just nothing.

25:06.704 --> 25:07.736
And then you join the militia.

25:07.738 --> 25:08.605
So it just makes me believe

25:08.607 --> 25:09.673
that there was something
that happened.

25:09.675 --> 25:12.578
Not on the books.
It's not in any of the reports.

25:14.244 --> 25:16.578
Something happened
that made you stop...

25:16.580 --> 25:18.848
until tonight.

25:20.885 --> 25:22.717
I know you're a hard ass,
Morris,

25:22.719 --> 25:24.921
and I know you're not allowed to
care about anybody or anything

25:24.923 --> 25:26.521
because then you're not
a hard ass anymore,

25:26.523 --> 25:30.626
but I just got this feeling
like it was personal.

25:30.628 --> 25:32.528
Someone hurt
somebody you care about.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.463
So you wanted to hurt them.

25:34.465 --> 25:35.466
What happened?

25:37.599 --> 25:37.636
A cop fuck your wife?

25:39.837 --> 25:40.906
Beat up your sister?

25:42.240 --> 25:43.407
Bang your daughter?

25:47.477 --> 25:48.746
What happened?

25:52.282 --> 25:53.715
<i>Rick McCollum here.
Gary, Indiana.</i>

25:53.717 --> 25:55.917
<i>Responding to
a distress call I got.</i>

25:55.919 --> 25:58.553
Rick.
We're isolated tech-wise

25:58.555 --> 26:00.655
and not giving out
any specific locations.

26:00.657 --> 26:03.626
So, please excuse my vagueness.

26:03.628 --> 26:05.461
<i>Alright, go ahead.</i>

26:05.463 --> 26:07.495
We're calling out
to all militia, letting you know

26:07.497 --> 26:11.334
that we had nothing to do
with anything on the news.

26:11.336 --> 26:12.702
<i>Copy that.</i>

26:12.704 --> 26:15.605
<i>You mean what's happening
in Michigan or Pennsylvania?</i>

26:15.607 --> 26:17.475
Wait, what's happening now?

26:19.377 --> 26:21.476
<i>Are you serious?</i>

26:21.478 --> 26:22.712
Tell me
what happened to her?

26:22.714 --> 26:23.980
Unless you're trying to
join your friends

26:23.982 --> 26:25.248
- from the cemetery.
- No, just tell me

26:25.250 --> 26:26.351
what they did to her.

26:28.785 --> 26:31.553
If the reason you did this
was halfway understandable,

26:31.555 --> 26:33.455
the public needs to know.

26:33.457 --> 26:35.523
The jury will take pity on you.

26:35.525 --> 26:37.862
You get moved to a safer prison
away from the Aryan Brotherhood.

26:39.830 --> 26:42.868
What if what you did
wasn't wrong?

26:44.369 --> 26:45.533
Think about that.
What if what you did

26:45.535 --> 26:46.571
was understandable?

26:48.505 --> 26:49.608
You got kids?

26:50.907 --> 26:52.340
Two.

26:52.342 --> 26:53.509
- Boys, girls?
- Girls?

26:53.511 --> 26:54.976
- How old?
- 8 and 12.

26:54.978 --> 26:56.614
What if one of them got raped?

26:58.282 --> 26:59.648
I'd kill the guy who did it.

26:59.650 --> 27:01.919
What if it was a gang?
What if they killed her after?

27:03.553 --> 27:04.819
When the gang got busted,

27:04.821 --> 27:06.489
you find out there was
an undercover cop inside,

27:06.491 --> 27:08.523
watched it happen
and did nothing,

27:08.525 --> 27:09.827
just to keep his cover safe.

27:11.428 --> 27:12.427
You try to go public,

27:12.429 --> 27:15.330
but lawyers don't have enough
to make a case

27:15.332 --> 27:16.499
and who's going to
represent a guy

27:16.501 --> 27:18.834
who's been a part of
what I have?

27:18.836 --> 27:21.337
So the cops keep the case
private,

27:21.339 --> 27:22.437
the cop anonymous,

27:22.439 --> 27:24.575
and turn you
into a conspiracy nut.

27:25.877 --> 27:28.743
I bet you knew who he was.

27:28.745 --> 27:34.317
You guys go huntin',
watch the game on Sunday.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.488
Celebrate when you heard
he wasn't being charged.

27:40.957 --> 27:43.392
If what happened to my daughter
was done by a normal person,

27:43.394 --> 27:45.030
they'd be looking
at the death penalty.

27:47.564 --> 27:48.899
Why shouldn't a cop?

27:50.467 --> 27:51.969
You did what
any parent would do.

27:54.105 --> 27:55.774
You didn't start this, Morris.
They did.

28:00.344 --> 28:01.579
Tell me you did it.

28:04.115 --> 28:05.651
Tell me you did it.

28:08.019 --> 28:08.818
I killed
that son of a bitch

28:08.820 --> 28:11.587
because he watched
my daughter die,

28:11.589 --> 28:12.655
and I waited a week,

28:12.657 --> 28:13.621
and came back
for the rest of 'em

28:13.623 --> 28:15.523
who let him get away with it.

28:15.525 --> 28:17.792
You want me to confess to doing
what needed to be done?

28:17.794 --> 28:20.631
Fine. Go get the radio.

28:32.776 --> 28:33.943
What was his name?

28:33.945 --> 28:35.110
Who?

28:35.112 --> 28:36.947
The cop you killed,
what was his name?

28:38.983 --> 28:40.018
Michaels.

28:48.126 --> 28:49.759
I'll bring the radio down.

28:49.761 --> 28:51.793
He's lying.

28:51.795 --> 28:56.067
The funeral was for a cop
named Callahan, not Michaels.

29:06.077 --> 29:07.809
We use him anyway.

29:07.811 --> 29:09.578
Give him to the cops,
they got their man.

29:09.580 --> 29:11.113
Give up the position
of the entire group

29:11.115 --> 29:12.548
to hand over the wrong guy?

29:12.550 --> 29:13.752
It buys us time.

29:15.119 --> 29:16.355
They're not going to break him.

29:40.744 --> 29:42.380
When I get out of this...

29:59.897 --> 30:02.833
Well, have at it.

30:14.978 --> 30:16.947
You just wanted to
give her some publicity.

30:19.984 --> 30:21.520
You didn't do shit.

30:37.234 --> 30:38.803
You still think
they won't break him?

30:59.557 --> 31:01.155
It's spreading.

31:01.157 --> 31:03.992
There's been three more attacks
on cops, all by militias.

31:03.994 --> 31:06.194
- Where?
- One in South Dakota

31:06.196 --> 31:09.264
on a police precinct,
one in Utah on a district court,

31:09.266 --> 31:11.068
and one in Pennsylvania
on a cop car.

31:15.639 --> 31:17.239
How many cops down total?

31:17.241 --> 31:19.841
- Eighty, give or take.
- Take how many?

31:19.843 --> 31:20.675
Well, if I knew
the answer to that,

31:20.677 --> 31:22.978
I wouldn't have said
give or take.

31:22.980 --> 31:24.646
Talked to
any of the leaders?

31:24.648 --> 31:26.882
Two. Both said
they're ready to launch attacks.

31:26.884 --> 31:28.017
Where?

31:28.019 --> 31:29.117
Pennsylvania,
and another one

31:29.119 --> 31:30.653
about seven miles from here.

31:30.655 --> 31:32.855
The 47th Precinct.

31:32.857 --> 31:34.255
Take out the last of them,
they said.

31:34.257 --> 31:35.991
They keep saying
they were inspired by them.

31:35.993 --> 31:37.162
No, no!

31:38.862 --> 31:40.197
We can't let them do that.

31:43.033 --> 31:45.136
Did you bet on the 48th
or something?

31:47.972 --> 31:49.674
You're too close in proximity.

31:51.943 --> 31:53.274
We're both
under the same umbrella.

31:53.276 --> 31:55.045
- Or a different group.
- To who?

31:57.348 --> 31:58.282
Do it.

31:59.649 --> 32:01.716
Tell them we had nothing
to do with this.

32:01.718 --> 32:03.087
To stop following it.

32:05.055 --> 32:06.056
Alright.

32:07.958 --> 32:09.924
I need to talk to Keating.

32:09.926 --> 32:11.562
You talk to people?

32:13.296 --> 32:14.865
Never heard you talk.

32:17.234 --> 32:20.205
Don't know if you ever
even spoke before.

32:26.109 --> 32:30.814
I live here 13 years now,
so I keep quiet myself.

32:34.985 --> 32:37.755
They've got schools
for kids like you?

32:43.194 --> 32:46.729
I was a highway contractor...

32:46.731 --> 32:50.098
until one of my crew
fucked up a pour.

32:50.100 --> 32:52.303
Used cheaper concrete
than usual.

32:55.639 --> 32:58.776
I had a pothole so big,
a semi hit it and capsized.

33:00.276 --> 33:01.912
Eighteen-car pileup.

33:03.714 --> 33:04.749
Five dead.

33:07.752 --> 33:12.823
I cover for the foreman
and get the crew to keep quiet.

33:16.292 --> 33:21.363
One night, the foreman started
tellin' me about coming clean,

33:21.365 --> 33:24.767
'cept his coming clean
was a lie.

33:24.769 --> 33:28.069
He'd get reduced time
if he said that me and my crew

33:28.071 --> 33:30.204
wanted to use
that cheap concrete

33:30.206 --> 33:31.709
to cause the rupture.

33:33.244 --> 33:36.377
Now, I didn't have one,

33:36.379 --> 33:39.083
but all my crew
had family at home.

33:40.751 --> 33:42.317
How are they going to
take care of their own

33:42.319 --> 33:43.989
from Jackson Correctional?

33:48.192 --> 33:49.327
So I killed him.

33:51.227 --> 33:52.397
Moved out here,

33:53.863 --> 33:55.899
save the others
a lot of trauma.

33:59.203 --> 34:00.739
But I gotta say,

34:01.972 --> 34:03.875
sometimes I get tired

34:06.811 --> 34:09.947
and I miss it. Back there.

34:11.882 --> 34:12.784
Hey Hubbel,

34:14.185 --> 34:15.387
wanna post up somewhere else?

34:26.429 --> 34:27.665
It's not Keating.

34:30.201 --> 34:31.866
What?

34:31.868 --> 34:33.434
We know it's not Morris.

34:33.436 --> 34:34.737
Right.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.404
Then that leaves Keating.

34:36.406 --> 34:40.976
The fuckin' mute moron
who is incapable of talking,

34:40.978 --> 34:44.246
much less manning
goddamn inspiring attack.

34:44.248 --> 34:48.784
Or Noah, who is.

34:48.786 --> 34:50.119
Keating's not our guy.

34:50.121 --> 34:51.353
No, you have to
let me question him.

34:51.355 --> 34:52.387
No, you don't.
He's not the guy.

34:52.389 --> 34:53.855
Then what are you proposing?

34:53.857 --> 34:55.224
We write a confession.

34:55.226 --> 34:58.293
Have Noah call the cops
on the CB to say he did it.

34:58.295 --> 34:59.764
Then we hand him over to them.

35:01.498 --> 35:03.165
- Why don't you get this?
- Wait a minute.

35:03.167 --> 35:04.800
Are you telling me you think
it's Noah because he was late?

35:04.802 --> 35:05.634
- No, because...
- But you don't think

35:05.636 --> 35:07.136
it's Keating
because he doesn't talk.

35:07.138 --> 35:09.170
Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

35:09.172 --> 35:10.773
Do you get it?

35:10.775 --> 35:12.241
This thing has spread.

35:12.243 --> 35:14.275
If we don't pin this
on one person,

35:14.277 --> 35:15.911
this whole thing is
going to turn into something

35:15.913 --> 35:17.346
that's not going to end,

35:17.348 --> 35:19.114
and a lot of people
are going to die.

35:19.116 --> 35:20.018
It wasn't Noah.

35:22.118 --> 35:24.253
Why not Noah,
you smug son of a bitch?

35:24.255 --> 35:25.457
Do you know something
I don't know?

35:28.859 --> 35:29.828
Okay. You know what?
You're right.

35:31.228 --> 35:32.163
You're right. It's Noah.

35:33.797 --> 35:34.933
That's the best option you got.

35:38.802 --> 35:41.235
Besides, it's not like
when the shootings happen,

35:41.237 --> 35:43.438
that the gunman
was ever described as...

35:43.440 --> 35:44.375
detached...

35:45.576 --> 35:47.011
quiet, antisocial.

35:50.380 --> 35:53.081
It's not like when these things
happen, anybody ever says,

35:53.083 --> 35:54.753
I never imagined
it would have been that guy.

35:57.520 --> 35:58.254
Right?

36:01.826 --> 36:04.025
I'm going to
question my suspect.

36:04.027 --> 36:05.163
I'd like you
to stay out of my way.

36:09.900 --> 36:10.835
What?

36:13.103 --> 36:14.405
You're hiding something.

36:15.471 --> 36:16.406
What is it?

36:18.909 --> 36:21.212
We always knew
this was going to happen.

36:24.514 --> 36:26.315
<i>Calling out to Abilene Militia.</i>

36:26.317 --> 36:29.217
Do not engage
with the 47th Precinct.

36:29.219 --> 36:31.054
I repeat.

36:33.156 --> 36:34.290
<i>We've been coming here,</i>

36:34.292 --> 36:39.397
getting together every week
for years to be prepared.

36:40.563 --> 36:42.533
Well, what have we
been prepping for?

36:44.634 --> 36:48.337
For the day
we hoped we'd never see,

36:48.339 --> 36:51.005
the day the seize happens.

36:51.007 --> 36:53.608
The morning Doomsday rolls in.

36:59.116 --> 37:02.451
Well, that day may look
a little different now,

37:02.453 --> 37:04.188
but that day is here.

37:05.556 --> 37:09.090
They say a militia man did this
and we're sitting here

37:09.092 --> 37:12.293
trying to make everybody think
it wasn't us.

37:12.295 --> 37:15.063
If you turn that on,
they come here

37:15.065 --> 37:17.465
and none of us make it out.

37:17.467 --> 37:19.337
We should be
at the armory loading up,

37:20.603 --> 37:24.639
go to that cop precinct
as one...

37:24.641 --> 37:27.608
us versus them,

37:27.610 --> 37:29.444
because this fight,
it has started,

37:29.446 --> 37:31.545
and we got to win it.

37:31.547 --> 37:33.484
So we go to war with cops?

37:35.252 --> 37:39.389
Deep down,
who didn't really want that?

37:42.493 --> 37:44.458
Hey.

37:44.460 --> 37:47.295
Hey, there's a car
rolling down now.

37:47.297 --> 37:49.463
- Lights out.
- Lights out now! Now!

38:28.404 --> 38:29.971
What the hell
are you doing?

38:29.973 --> 38:32.174
I'm not gonna die
for something I didn't do.

38:52.663 --> 38:53.628
If he sees Noah,

38:53.630 --> 38:54.599
the others will go.

39:09.612 --> 39:11.445
Call in a location
with other militia.

39:11.447 --> 39:12.279
What are you talking about?

39:12.281 --> 39:14.181
Listen to me,
the cops will leave

39:14.183 --> 39:15.419
if you call another location.

39:17.020 --> 39:18.619
The militia that was
gonna attack the 47th.

39:36.306 --> 39:38.476
The side door.
He's gonna see Noah.

39:40.110 --> 39:41.179
Goddamn it!

40:04.567 --> 40:05.766
<i>Six-one-two...</i>

40:05.768 --> 40:06.701
I'd like to report the location

40:06.703 --> 40:07.636
of a militia in Kitchman

40:07.638 --> 40:09.603
planning an attack
on the 47th Precinct.

40:09.605 --> 40:12.476
Their location is 1-8-9-2-1.

40:51.147 --> 40:53.181
<i>Dispatch,
this is Unit 4301, copy that.</i>

40:53.183 --> 40:53.818
<i>En route.</i>

41:20.243 --> 41:21.144
Hey!

41:22.279 --> 41:24.179
I'm gonna go check on Noah.

41:24.181 --> 41:26.217
Hubbel, go with him.

41:27.317 --> 41:28.753
You won't mind company.

41:39.163 --> 41:41.766
Hey Hubbel, I need to
go talk to the suspect alone.

41:43.467 --> 41:44.333
Why don't you stand here
and try not to

41:44.335 --> 41:46.204
fuck everything up
by being yourself?

41:56.313 --> 41:58.313
It wasn't Morris.

41:58.315 --> 41:59.183
How do you know?

42:00.484 --> 42:02.183
It was Keating.

42:02.185 --> 42:03.918
- You questioned him?
- Not yet.

42:03.920 --> 42:05.719
Then, how do you know?

42:05.721 --> 42:07.588
Because it has to be.

42:07.590 --> 42:08.857
You'll never
get him to confess.

42:08.859 --> 42:10.491
He doesn't talk.

42:10.493 --> 42:11.528
Then he can write it down.

42:12.828 --> 42:14.764
They'll kill me if you don't
get him to confess.

42:16.667 --> 42:17.634
I'm not going to leave you here.

42:19.268 --> 42:20.170
All right?

42:21.371 --> 42:22.273
You're my brother.

42:25.375 --> 42:26.344
I'll get you out.

43:37.748 --> 43:39.282
- All right.
- Hey...

43:41.518 --> 43:43.451
Need you here.

43:43.453 --> 43:44.652
Kinda in the middle
of something...

43:44.654 --> 43:45.956
Now.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.595
If you try and go over my head
like that again,

43:51.895 --> 43:53.898
I'll hand you over
to the cops myself.

43:55.398 --> 43:56.534
Turn it up.

43:59.636 --> 44:00.768
<i>...took place over 30 seconds,</i>

44:00.770 --> 44:02.871
<i>and the assailant
fired off 400 rounds,</i>

44:02.873 --> 44:04.105
<i>but police have informed us</i>

44:04.107 --> 44:07.574
<i>in fact, it took two minutes
and 1,400 rounds.</i>

44:07.576 --> 44:10.578
<i>Also, the attack took place on
the south side of the cemetery,</i>

44:10.580 --> 44:12.047
<i>which has authorities puzzled,</i>

44:12.049 --> 44:14.382
<i>considering the difficulties
to gain access</i>

44:14.384 --> 44:15.784
<i>to the south side by car.</i>

44:15.786 --> 44:18.018
<i>For AM News 11:30, I'm...</i>

44:18.020 --> 44:19.753
If you can't prove
it's Keating,

44:19.755 --> 44:21.755
I'm going to write
a confession note,

44:21.757 --> 44:25.295
I'm going to string a noose,
and I'm going to hang Noah.

44:30.433 --> 44:32.902
Beckmann says public shooters
usually kill themselves.

44:34.503 --> 44:37.975
Then this one can too,
just a little later than usual.

45:46.976 --> 45:48.011
I know you don't talk much.

45:57.686 --> 45:58.989
I also know you can hear.

46:06.163 --> 46:07.561
Page nine.

46:07.563 --> 46:10.598
That is particularly
interesting.

46:10.600 --> 46:13.034
"Each and all,
they will lay reticent.

46:13.036 --> 46:13.938
"Taciturn...

46:15.806 --> 46:19.940
"Gone to the dim
and out with silence.

46:19.942 --> 46:20.977
"Their crime

46:23.212 --> 46:26.783
"whose only punishment fit

46:28.985 --> 46:29.954
"is execution,

46:33.757 --> 46:36.560
"yet it could have been ceased,

46:39.496 --> 46:41.165
"extinguished, yielded,

46:42.833 --> 46:43.768
"if only

46:45.969 --> 46:47.505
"the ones who spoke

46:51.674 --> 46:52.676
are established."

47:14.764 --> 47:16.500
Keating, let me explain
what's gonna happen to you here.

47:18.235 --> 47:20.534
You're either going to confess,

47:20.536 --> 47:21.471
or I'm going to say you did it.

47:22.906 --> 47:24.938
And they will come here,

47:24.940 --> 47:25.975
and they're going to put
your neck in that...

47:28.210 --> 47:29.479
and you're gonna swing from it.

47:31.581 --> 47:32.783
And that really
would be a tragedy

47:34.951 --> 47:36.987
because no one is gonna know
what you had to say in all this.

47:39.089 --> 47:40.090
This was nice.

47:43.259 --> 47:44.794
A very nice thing to watch.

47:46.295 --> 47:48.630
But did you really think
it would work?

47:48.632 --> 47:52.666
This little performance
would make me want to confess?

47:52.668 --> 47:55.036
A stage reading in my journal,
which is inadmissible at best,

47:55.038 --> 47:57.105
would excite me
to take responsibility

47:57.107 --> 47:58.242
for these actions?

47:59.808 --> 48:00.974
I can tell you're not using
FAINT interview technique

48:00.976 --> 48:01.942
due to your lack of structure,

48:01.944 --> 48:06.079
but as nice as this was,
it wasn't effective.

48:08.150 --> 48:09.217
Are you
out of your fuckin' mind?

48:09.219 --> 48:10.753
Did you fire off
a fuckin' round?

48:12.656 --> 48:13.590
Yes.

48:14.891 --> 48:15.926
He did.

48:18.627 --> 48:19.826
<i>Negative, Clark County,</i>

48:19.828 --> 48:21.695
<i>Nevada just had
three separate attacks. Over.</i>

48:21.697 --> 48:22.831
<i>Copy that.</i>

48:22.833 --> 48:24.766
<i>Any news activity
in Texas as well? Over.</i>

48:24.768 --> 48:25.800
<i>Copy. How many Tac units</i>

48:25.802 --> 48:27.768
<i>got dispatched to Top Hill?
Over.</i>

48:27.770 --> 48:28.804
<i>Kowalski, here.</i>

48:28.806 --> 48:30.241
<i>That's 23 units, two-three.
Over.</i>

48:32.609 --> 48:33.641
<i>Running up to
Groves and Witheby,</i>

48:33.643 --> 48:35.279
<i>got a call on a vacant auto.
Over.</i>

48:43.319 --> 48:47.855
Yes, Lieutenant Kowalski.
Over.

48:47.857 --> 48:49.991
<i>This is
a closed channel, goddamn it.</i>

48:49.993 --> 48:52.996
Copy that.
I have a message for you.

48:58.634 --> 49:00.034
Hotel Charlie Echo.

49:00.036 --> 49:02.606
I repeat, Hotel Charlie Echo.

49:05.609 --> 49:06.277
<i>Who is this?</i>

49:08.011 --> 49:11.645
I-I can't...
I can't tell you that.

49:11.647 --> 49:12.880
<i>Hang on, HQ.
Got a group of men</i>

49:12.882 --> 49:15.949
<i>inside the vehicle
on Groves and Witheby. Over.</i>

49:15.951 --> 49:17.751
<i>Copy that. Kowalski,</i>

49:17.753 --> 49:18.719
<i>proceed with caution.</i>

49:18.721 --> 49:19.654
<i>And whoever this is,
I repeat,</i>

49:19.656 --> 49:21.659
<i>this is a closed
goddamn channel.</i>

49:23.027 --> 49:25.994
<i>HQ, HQ, men descending
on my position from tree-line!</i>

49:25.996 --> 49:27.628
<i>Immediate assistance requested,
I repeat...</i>

49:31.768 --> 49:32.636
<i>Kowalski?</i>

49:35.071 --> 49:36.670
<i>Kowalski,
please respond.</i>

49:36.672 --> 49:37.971
Try not to seem so shocked.

49:37.973 --> 49:38.806
Any person of intelligence

49:38.808 --> 49:40.808
will keep silent
in this environment.

49:40.810 --> 49:42.809
An outcast mute,

49:42.811 --> 49:45.279
all of a sudden,
starts talking like he's a book.

49:45.281 --> 49:47.317
I got a feeling
this has been rehearsed.

49:50.386 --> 49:51.918
If you want me to talk
to Salinger here,

49:51.920 --> 49:53.123
I need you guys to walk away.

50:09.672 --> 50:12.440
Now you picked a pretty
special night to start talking.

50:12.442 --> 50:13.608
Most topics
under discussion here,

50:13.610 --> 50:16.110
I disagree with or am not
qualified to give an opinion on.

50:16.112 --> 50:17.411
So why even be here?

50:17.413 --> 50:21.882
I was instructed
to socialize more.

50:21.884 --> 50:22.785
- By who?
- Whom.

50:26.690 --> 50:29.791
You seem smart. Guess.

50:29.793 --> 50:32.360
So you picked
a militia to socialize.

50:32.362 --> 50:33.895
This is the only
environment which qualifies

50:33.897 --> 50:35.896
where no one cared
whether or not I spoke

50:35.898 --> 50:38.433
as long as I showed up
and believed in the cause.

50:38.435 --> 50:39.367
Right,
I'm gonna have to ask you

50:39.369 --> 50:41.302
a few more questions
just because I'm now

50:41.304 --> 50:43.204
dealing with a completely
different human being.

50:43.206 --> 50:44.806
Be my guest.

50:44.808 --> 50:47.842
- What's your name?
- Keating Vassileff.

50:47.844 --> 50:50.244
- Where do you live?
- 6420, Clifton Road.

50:50.246 --> 50:52.313
- How old are you?
- 23.

50:52.315 --> 50:53.246
What is the highest
grade of education

50:53.248 --> 50:54.782
you completed?

50:54.784 --> 50:55.717
I was four credits
short of graduating

50:55.719 --> 50:57.150
summa cum laude
on a Mitchell Scholarship

50:57.152 --> 50:59.253
at University of Michigan.
At 19, however...

50:59.255 --> 51:00.387
Did you commit the shooting?

51:00.389 --> 51:01.456
Which one?

51:01.458 --> 51:02.790
What do you mean,
which one?

51:02.792 --> 51:03.824
One put an officer
in the ground,

51:03.826 --> 51:06.360
another took down those
attending his funeral.

51:06.362 --> 51:07.462
Which one?

51:07.464 --> 51:09.329
Did you conspire
to commit either?

51:09.331 --> 51:11.132
Conspire, as in
making plans in secret

51:11.134 --> 51:13.266
in an attempt to carry out
an unlawful or harmful act

51:13.268 --> 51:14.869
with another human being?

51:14.871 --> 51:16.369
Yeah, that's the one.

51:16.371 --> 51:17.739
There's something
you have to understand about me.

51:17.741 --> 51:19.273
I'm isolated.

51:19.275 --> 51:23.277
And because of my isolation,
I've had to compensate.

51:23.279 --> 51:26.246
And my personal form of such
was learning,

51:26.248 --> 51:28.315
absorbing knowledge,
collecting information.

51:28.317 --> 51:29.250
So I know all the ways
you failed to do

51:29.252 --> 51:31.319
what it is you're
currently trying to do.

51:31.321 --> 51:32.954
MITT technique.
Scan method.

51:32.956 --> 51:34.188
Integrated
irrelevant questions.

51:34.190 --> 51:36.224
None will work.

51:36.226 --> 51:39.761
So please, sit.

51:39.763 --> 51:42.329
Give me everything you have.
Show me my mistakes.

51:42.331 --> 51:44.297
Show me how you know it was me.

51:44.299 --> 51:45.967
You're not going to make this
easy on me, are you?

51:45.969 --> 51:48.335
Easy for me? Yes.

51:48.337 --> 51:51.340
For you? I can't say.

52:09.292 --> 52:10.157
You have enough
ammunition in your locker

52:10.159 --> 52:11.793
to take down
a branch of government.

52:11.795 --> 52:13.795
That's militia armor.

52:13.797 --> 52:16.029
There's enough evidence in there
to incriminate every one of us.

52:16.031 --> 52:18.266
You've the map of the cemetery
and a plan

52:18.268 --> 52:20.101
and the exact same style
of attack.

52:20.103 --> 52:22.103
Plans? Yes. Of what?
Who could say?

52:22.105 --> 52:24.838
It's a 300-page
manifesto of reasons

52:24.840 --> 52:26.541
why the world
never listened to you,

52:26.543 --> 52:28.241
wrapped up in the psychopath
gold standard

52:28.243 --> 52:30.344
of a fucking novel.

52:30.346 --> 52:31.878
I'm still learning
my writing style.

52:31.880 --> 52:33.413
Do you ever lie
to get out of trouble?

52:33.415 --> 52:35.916
I've never been in trouble.

52:35.918 --> 52:37.250
Ever tried to
get even with someone?

52:37.252 --> 52:39.455
Getting even means
lowering yourself. So, no.

52:42.225 --> 52:44.324
Comparative questions and
leveraging identifiable traits.

52:44.326 --> 52:47.195
This isn't working.
Change tactic.

52:47.197 --> 52:49.063
What are you gonna do when they
find your DNA at the cemetery?

52:49.065 --> 52:50.965
They will.
I walk there, all the time.

52:50.967 --> 52:51.965
God, you're a smart kid.

52:51.967 --> 52:53.400
A compliment to gain rapport.

52:53.402 --> 52:55.603
This is insulting to the mental
capacity of the accused.

52:55.605 --> 52:59.005
Is that something they recommend
when teaching this method?

52:59.007 --> 53:01.275
You know what's interesting?

53:01.277 --> 53:02.210
- What?
- Why haven't you

53:02.212 --> 53:03.444
brought up the fact
that Morris and Noah

53:03.446 --> 53:06.514
have splash patterns of mud
on their pant legs, and I don't?

53:06.516 --> 53:07.581
It didn't rain today.

53:07.583 --> 53:08.516
But it rained all week.

53:08.518 --> 53:10.483
Safe to say
there's mud near a cemetery

53:10.485 --> 53:12.520
if you're escaping on foot.

53:12.522 --> 53:14.154
Safe to say you own
another pair of pants.

53:14.156 --> 53:15.857
Why haven't you swabbed
copper and potassium chloride

53:15.859 --> 53:18.025
on our wrists to see
whose show gunpowder residue?

53:18.027 --> 53:19.559
Because you'd see that
I haven't shot a gun in days,

53:19.561 --> 53:20.527
but one of them has.

53:20.529 --> 53:22.963
Gun residue tests
are inherently unreliable.

53:22.965 --> 53:26.032
Did you forget that we live
within two miles of each other?

53:26.034 --> 53:28.201
And I assume you heard it.

53:28.203 --> 53:30.404
I thought it was
fireworks at first.

53:30.406 --> 53:32.373
So I turned on
my police scanner.

53:32.375 --> 53:34.942
<i>"Shots fired on
officer funeral in progress.</i>

53:34.944 --> 53:37.445
<i>1010, Wilcox Road,
explosive devices detonated.</i>

53:37.447 --> 53:40.213
<i>Immediate assistance requested."</i>

53:40.215 --> 53:42.616
So what? You know what
they said on the radio.

53:42.618 --> 53:43.784
You could have heard it
while you were attack...

53:43.786 --> 53:46.857
I could have heard a radio
over an AR-15 assault rifle?

53:49.958 --> 53:50.893
Are you going to stop? I get it.

53:52.362 --> 53:54.462
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

53:54.464 --> 53:56.563
You know, when I first
went off by myself,

53:56.565 --> 53:58.498
people asked if I was lonely.

53:58.500 --> 54:00.101
And I answered them people
looking at me funny

54:00.103 --> 54:01.405
saying they didn't think
I knew how to talk.

54:03.672 --> 54:05.672
You know, and they said
loneliness is

54:05.674 --> 54:08.141
worse than smoking.

54:08.143 --> 54:12.346
It causes heart disease,
depression, suicide,

54:12.348 --> 54:14.116
early death
in all its variants.

54:16.386 --> 54:18.652
I say, bullshit.

54:18.654 --> 54:22.158
I say, togetherness,
that's weakness.

54:26.128 --> 54:28.161
Loneliness brought us
everything.

54:28.163 --> 54:30.630
Loneliness brought us the great
books, great musicians.

54:30.632 --> 54:33.203
I say loneliness builds...

54:36.605 --> 54:37.540
I lie.

54:41.444 --> 54:43.411
Because the truth is,
I live in a room alone.

54:43.413 --> 54:47.181
I got the shades drawn,
bottles on the floor,

54:47.183 --> 54:48.349
all the smartest ways
to hate the world

54:48.351 --> 54:50.150
and fastest ways to go insane.

54:50.152 --> 54:52.522
Brilliant. Morose.
Typical...

54:55.290 --> 54:57.491
just like you.

54:57.493 --> 55:00.427
Both of us thinking we're
poles apart from each other.

55:00.429 --> 55:01.728
Both of us thinking
that we're the other ones

55:01.730 --> 55:02.999
that people look up to.

55:05.335 --> 55:08.605
You're brilliant, Keating.
You're just like me.

55:11.139 --> 55:12.042
I know you did it.

55:14.978 --> 55:16.513
And we're not going to stop
until you say you did.

55:30.293 --> 55:34.094
Force of assertion plus
leverage to get a confession.

55:34.096 --> 55:35.130
I don't mean to trade
monologues with you,

55:35.132 --> 55:37.498
but you know what happens
in solitary confinement?

55:37.500 --> 55:38.733
I got a feeling
I'm gonna find out.

55:38.735 --> 55:43.003
Sensory deprivation,
social skills nullify,

55:43.005 --> 55:44.204
they move their beds
to the wall

55:44.206 --> 55:46.042
so that they can feel
something.

55:47.643 --> 55:51.045
You say loneliness builds.
I say it amplifies.

55:51.047 --> 55:53.514
Makes you notice
what you wished you didn't.

55:53.516 --> 55:56.717
And the real question is,
how do you fight that feeling?

55:56.719 --> 55:58.686
You sleep with your TV on

55:58.688 --> 56:01.154
and have friends who
you've nothing in common with,

56:01.156 --> 56:02.425
marry who you don't love?

56:04.460 --> 56:06.330
Join a militia
for an unknown reason.

56:09.098 --> 56:11.165
Whatever put you out there
by yourself, Gannon,

56:11.167 --> 56:13.567
eavesdropping on the world
that lost its use for you,

56:13.569 --> 56:15.735
punishing society by
depriving it of your presence,

56:15.737 --> 56:17.404
I really don't care about.

56:17.406 --> 56:18.405
What I do care about is:

56:18.407 --> 56:20.310
What could possibly
bring you back into this?

56:22.110 --> 56:23.277
I told you why
I joined the militia,

56:23.279 --> 56:25.579
but why would you?

56:25.581 --> 56:27.348
I mean, you don't strike me
as a classic 'minuteman'

56:27.350 --> 56:29.116
so that takes 'belief' out.

56:29.118 --> 56:30.418
An ex-cop
moves out on his own

56:30.420 --> 56:32.319
suggests you wanted to
be away from guns,

56:32.321 --> 56:33.489
not be near them again.

56:36.826 --> 56:38.128
So I'm left with: A person.

56:40.263 --> 56:42.695
Someone in here
secretly matters to you

56:42.697 --> 56:44.665
more than you let on.

56:44.667 --> 56:48.471
So, who is it?
I can't say it's me.

56:51.507 --> 56:54.275
Beckmann seems a little
high strung for you.

56:54.277 --> 56:55.476
Morris? No.

56:55.478 --> 56:56.780
Hubble? No.

56:59.114 --> 57:00.317
That leaves Ford...

57:03.252 --> 57:04.186
and Noah.

57:09.826 --> 57:11.360
What's so special
about him, Gannon?

57:13.628 --> 57:14.594
What's it going to feel like

57:14.596 --> 57:16.499
having to hang someone
so important to you?

57:49.866 --> 57:51.297
Open your fuckin' mouth.

57:51.299 --> 57:53.467
Open your mouth.
Eat it.

57:53.469 --> 57:56.137
Eat it, you little shit, say it.
I wanna hear you say it.

57:56.139 --> 57:57.172
I wanna hear you say you did it,

57:57.174 --> 57:58.771
or I'm gonna feed you
your own fuckin' diary.

57:58.773 --> 58:00.277
Your own fuckin' diary!

58:44.420 --> 58:46.022
Where we at
with Holden Caulfield?

58:49.891 --> 58:50.826
Gannon?

58:58.601 --> 58:59.900
Bring Noah in.

58:59.902 --> 59:00.837
No!

59:16.953 --> 59:17.753
You know, all these shootings;

59:21.790 --> 59:22.825
you know what
they all have in common?

59:25.594 --> 59:26.696
Everyone knows
the shooter's name.

59:37.540 --> 59:40.277
What if...
I took that away from you?

59:41.543 --> 59:42.545
What if I did it?

59:44.580 --> 59:45.549
You won't.

59:51.286 --> 59:52.886
You asked me
a question, Keating.

59:52.888 --> 59:53.956
Why did I leave?

59:56.292 --> 01:00:00.326
When I was a cop,
I worked in anti-gang units.

01:00:00.328 --> 01:00:02.996
I was a UC; we'd go into
these different groups.

01:00:02.998 --> 01:00:05.532
We'd plant evidence,
and we raid 'em.

01:00:05.534 --> 01:00:07.867
There's another cop
I used to work with, Richmond.

01:00:07.869 --> 01:00:10.670
And we were taking down
a white supremacy cell.

01:00:10.672 --> 01:00:11.875
I got a call from my superior.

01:00:13.842 --> 01:00:15.978
He says, meet me...
out in the woods.

01:00:22.851 --> 01:00:23.853
What are we doin' out here?

01:00:31.893 --> 01:00:32.861
<i>Eleven of 'em come out.</i>

01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:47.978
So he starts taking
these bullets...

01:00:51.413 --> 01:00:54.581
and he's throwing 'em
at my feet,

01:00:54.583 --> 01:00:58.319
tacks to see if I'd move.

01:00:58.321 --> 01:00:59.253
If we do this,

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:01.422
and blame it
on the Klan cell you're in,

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:02.989
we can raid them tonight,

01:01:02.991 --> 01:01:05.092
and any other group that
they're working with by Rico.

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:06.029
You're out.

01:01:08.096 --> 01:01:08.998
If we do what?

01:01:14.936 --> 01:01:16.272
<i>And there was Richmond.</i>

01:01:17.839 --> 01:01:19.340
We've been sending him threats

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:20.974
from the Klan cell
for the past three months.

01:01:20.976 --> 01:01:24.078
Got fingerprints from
Klan members left at his house

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.746
and we can place
three of his key leaders

01:01:26.748 --> 01:01:28.349
at this scene here tonight.

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:33.923
So, now, all you need to do...

01:01:39.661 --> 01:01:40.694
Why him?

01:01:40.696 --> 01:01:41.764
We need a body.

01:01:44.799 --> 01:01:48.937
And the only other person
we can place prints on, is you.

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:04.418
<i>Kill one of your own
to take down the others.</i>

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.822
I need to know where you stand.

01:02:53.768 --> 01:02:56.503
We raided
15 Klan cells that week,

01:02:56.505 --> 01:02:58.041
stopped 'em from doing
God knows what.

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:00.677
But I was done.

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:05.548
<i>I lost someone that night.</i>

01:03:09.884 --> 01:03:10.919
<i>I'm not going to do it again.</i>

01:03:12.654 --> 01:03:14.454
Tonight should've been me.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:18.762
And now when they find my body,

01:03:20.862 --> 01:03:21.797
who will it be?

01:03:40.181 --> 01:03:41.083
I did it.

01:04:21.257 --> 01:04:23.155
My name is Keating Vassileff.

01:04:23.157 --> 01:04:25.025
I'm 23 years old.

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:26.862
I live at 6420 Clifton Road.

01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:31.297
I'm the gunman
who attacked the funeral.

01:04:31.299 --> 01:04:32.965
I planned the attack alone.

01:04:32.967 --> 01:04:35.067
I carried it out alone.

01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:36.837
The militias had no prior
knowledge of my intentions,

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:39.540
nor do they condone my actions.

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:41.974
The weapon used is my AR-15,
which I obtained legally

01:04:41.976 --> 01:04:43.543
without any additional
participant

01:04:43.545 --> 01:04:45.248
in the delivery of the weapon
or ammunition.

01:04:47.081 --> 01:04:49.282
I chose to attack
north side Wilcox Cemetery

01:04:49.284 --> 01:04:51.951
because that's the fastest
route to the highway

01:04:51.953 --> 01:04:52.953
so that the attack
could take place

01:04:52.955 --> 01:04:54.190
in less than 30 seconds.

01:04:56.058 --> 01:05:01.027
And that's when I fired up
about, about 400 rounds.

01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:02.161
400 exactly.

01:05:02.163 --> 01:05:04.130
And, I chose to escape
on foot

01:05:04.132 --> 01:05:05.732
because that would have

01:05:05.734 --> 01:05:07.768
the least amount of attention
for that kind of travel,

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:09.335
and no one would expect
someone such as myself

01:05:09.337 --> 01:05:11.971
to have the mental acuity
to see through the expectations

01:05:11.973 --> 01:05:14.710
of what people think
I'm capable of, consistently.

01:05:16.712 --> 01:05:20.813
The reasoning for my assault,
for my raid on these people,

01:05:20.815 --> 01:05:23.916
is justified and warranted
by those attacked

01:05:23.918 --> 01:05:25.886
who forced me to be
the champion of this cause

01:05:25.888 --> 01:05:28.788
because, because
they chose to ignore me.

01:05:28.790 --> 01:05:30.924
They chose not to listen to me.

01:05:30.926 --> 01:05:32.661
They chose not to include me.
So I...

01:05:34.596 --> 01:05:36.829
I included them.

01:05:36.831 --> 01:05:38.264
<i>Their inefficiency,
their ineptitude,</i>

01:05:38.266 --> 01:05:40.300
<i>their mediocrity,
their blatant inferiority</i>

01:05:40.302 --> 01:05:42.069
<i>is what delivered
this reckoning.</i>

01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:44.837
<i>And I acted as the pitchfork,
as the staff,</i>

01:05:44.839 --> 01:05:47.242
as, as the...

01:06:00.822 --> 01:06:03.724
Um, and, and that's,
that's why I did what I did.

01:06:03.726 --> 01:06:05.391
I'll be waiting on the corner
of Mound and Middlebelt Road

01:06:05.393 --> 01:06:07.296
in 25 minutes, unarmed.

01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:23.679
Are we good?

01:06:34.188 --> 01:06:35.889
<i>Another false confession.</i>

01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:37.724
<i>Third one in the last hour.</i>

01:06:37.726 --> 01:06:38.425
<i>They just keeping coming.</i>

01:06:38.427 --> 01:06:40.259
<i>Don't pay any attention.</i>

01:06:40.261 --> 01:06:41.360
<i>You may wanna
think about changing channels</i>

01:06:41.362 --> 01:06:42.931
<i>to cut down on the nut factor.</i>

01:06:48.703 --> 01:06:51.337
Two people
lying about the same crime

01:06:51.339 --> 01:06:52.641
in less than an hour.

01:06:54.442 --> 01:06:55.844
It's my job
to get a confession.

01:06:58.212 --> 01:06:59.147
Not the truth.

01:07:00.415 --> 01:07:01.316
It's Noah.

01:08:24.298 --> 01:08:25.301
It's not Morris...

01:08:27.035 --> 01:08:28.104
and it's not Keating.

01:08:31.339 --> 01:08:32.274
Noah...

01:08:37.511 --> 01:08:40.381
I need to hear,
I need to hear you didn't do it.

01:08:48.790 --> 01:08:49.926
Tell me you didn't do it.

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:55.362
All I ever wanted

01:08:55.363 --> 01:08:58.899
was to not be
an embarrassment to you,

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:00.103
just once, Gannon.

01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:03.138
Just once.

01:09:04.839 --> 01:09:05.874
What are you talking about?

01:09:07.542 --> 01:09:08.844
What did you do?

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:12.447
I'm sorry.

01:09:15.017 --> 01:09:17.453
You don't understand.

01:09:31.332 --> 01:09:33.770
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- You have got a gun.

01:09:38.106 --> 01:09:39.108
Untie him.

01:09:40.308 --> 01:09:41.209
You're making
a big mistake here.

01:09:42.944 --> 01:09:44.045
I need you to listen to me
for a second.

01:09:47.281 --> 01:09:48.881
Alright.
Listen to me.

01:09:48.883 --> 01:09:49.750
Step away. Step away.

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:51.850
Listen to me.
It's not him.

01:09:51.853 --> 01:09:52.788
Ford...

01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:56.159
wait a minute.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.295
Stop!

01:10:01.996 --> 01:10:03.266
Ford, he's my brother.

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:07.270
So?

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:27.356
Gannon.

01:10:39.968 --> 01:10:40.903
Gannon!

01:10:45.606 --> 01:10:46.842
I didn't do it.

01:10:50.111 --> 01:10:51.379
Gannon, please.

01:10:54.215 --> 01:10:57.352
Please, Gannon. Please.

01:11:41.228 --> 01:11:42.130
Who's got their phone?

01:11:44.298 --> 01:11:45.567
Who's got their fucking phone?

01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:50.636
Spread out, find it!

01:11:50.638 --> 01:11:52.604
Find it!

01:11:52.606 --> 01:11:53.642
Watch him.

01:12:05.253 --> 01:12:06.956
You know where it is.

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:02.277
The cops are coming, man.

01:13:04.612 --> 01:13:05.647
I need you ready.

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:17.625
How long do we have?

01:13:44.218 --> 01:13:45.154
It's a timer.

01:13:53.261 --> 01:13:54.693
Come on,
are you alright?

01:13:54.695 --> 01:13:57.197
Come on. Get up.
Can you walk? Come on.

01:14:12.347 --> 01:14:13.215
The whole time!

01:14:20.655 --> 01:14:21.557
You ruined us.

01:14:24.825 --> 01:14:25.828
You brought this.

01:15:06.868 --> 01:15:08.337
Out! Now!

01:16:17.539 --> 01:16:18.770
Are you undercover?

01:16:47.602 --> 01:16:48.771
Ford, tell them
it was you and me.

01:16:52.307 --> 01:16:53.442
It was you and me.

01:16:56.444 --> 01:16:58.677
Ford, you just
got to tell the truth.

01:16:58.679 --> 01:17:01.881
You tell them it was you and me,
and everybody else goes free.

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:03.683
He's lying.

01:17:03.685 --> 01:17:05.318
You guys hear that?
It was me and Ford.

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.855
Shut the fuck up.

01:18:59.933 --> 01:19:01.070
Alright, get Noah up.

01:19:03.704 --> 01:19:05.104
<i>Kowalski here with 23 unit.</i>

01:19:05.106 --> 01:19:08.107
<i>HQ, HQ, militia ascending
on my position from tree line.</i>

01:19:08.109 --> 01:19:09.641
<i>Immediate assistance requested.</i>

01:19:09.643 --> 01:19:11.010
<i>I repeat.
Immediate assistance.</i>

01:19:11.012 --> 01:19:12.748
Get them back to
the precinct to be debriefed.

01:19:15.182 --> 01:19:16.448
<i>32, Oscar Victor Charlie...</i>

01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:18.917
<i>I've got a Caucasian male
at the lumber warehouse</i>

01:19:18.919 --> 01:19:20.720
<i>on Sparrow and Cedar.</i>

01:19:20.722 --> 01:19:21.854
<i>...attack
took place over 30 seconds,</i>

01:19:21.856 --> 01:19:24.055
<i>and the assailant
firing off 400 rounds.</i>

01:19:24.057 --> 01:19:25.957
<i>AM News 11:30.</i>

01:19:25.959 --> 01:19:27.859
<i>Need immediate Evac.</i>

01:19:27.861 --> 01:19:29.494
Somebody get HQ on the radio.

01:19:29.496 --> 01:19:30.531
Tell them we need
a body disposal unit.

01:19:35.469 --> 01:19:36.735
We've got
four down, right away, please.

01:19:48.615 --> 01:19:49.951
All they did was make threats.

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:53.519
Say they were
going to attack us,

01:19:53.521 --> 01:19:54.787
we needed to do something.

01:20:01.929 --> 01:20:03.798
So we faked an attack
on ourselves.

01:20:05.767 --> 01:20:07.002
You made it up?

01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:14.806
And all it took was
hiding a single gun

01:20:14.808 --> 01:20:17.710
to make them
tear themselves apart.

01:20:17.712 --> 01:20:21.213
We plant the seed of society
being torn down,

01:20:21.215 --> 01:20:24.583
<i>chaos actually happening,
spreading,</i>

01:20:24.585 --> 01:20:27.252
<i>making them believe that
others were following along,</i>

01:20:27.254 --> 01:20:28.355
<i>that they started
some revolution.</i>

01:20:31.558 --> 01:20:33.428
<i>Coming together
as who we needed them to be.</i>

01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:36.828
They believed
they weren't alone in this,

01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:38.967
but really,
they're part of nothing.

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:43.502
<i>An Ex-Aryan Brotherhood member
who ties to cop murders.</i>

01:20:43.504 --> 01:20:46.171
<i>A missing highwayman
responsible for five deaths,</i>

01:20:46.173 --> 01:20:49.108
<i>some kid plotting to shoot up
his old high school.</i>

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:51.243
These aren't a loss, Gannon.

01:20:51.245 --> 01:20:54.680
These are pieces on a board
for a bigger play.

01:20:54.682 --> 01:20:57.783
<i>Northern Michigan militia
found with automatic weapons.</i>

01:20:57.785 --> 01:20:59.952
Armor piercing rounds,

01:20:59.954 --> 01:21:01.790
and plans to attack
a police funeral.

01:21:06.727 --> 01:21:08.094
If you bring in
the best interrogator

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:10.296
the police ever had?

01:21:10.298 --> 01:21:11.997
<i>Someone who's
made people confess</i>

01:21:11.999 --> 01:21:14.069
<i>to what they've never
done countless times?</i>

01:21:15.736 --> 01:21:18.003
Someone who knows
we track signals,

01:21:18.005 --> 01:21:19.072
<i>and will keep the militia</i>

01:21:19.074 --> 01:21:20.843
<i>on a defensive,
unreachable lockdown.</i>

01:21:24.111 --> 01:21:26.047
One night gives us
a tipping point.

01:21:27.581 --> 01:21:29.948
No more psychopaths
with automatic rifles,

01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:32.318
no more lunatics
who can go buy a machine gun

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.589
and walk into a school.

01:21:37.225 --> 01:21:38.826
We did it perfectly.

01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:48.203
Stay down.

01:21:55.209 --> 01:21:56.278
Put it down, Gannon.

01:22:07.588 --> 01:22:08.756
Why didn't you tell me?

01:22:11.993 --> 01:22:12.861
You could have just...

01:22:19.968 --> 01:22:21.970
After everything I did.

01:22:25.205 --> 01:22:26.107
Why didn't you just tell me?

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:29.278
I'm sorry.

01:22:30.777 --> 01:22:32.114
You're not a cop anymore.

01:22:57.405 --> 01:22:58.269
Good to see you again, brother.

01:22:58.271 --> 01:22:59.240
You too.

01:23:05.913 --> 01:23:06.815
Guns down.

01:23:13.687 --> 01:23:15.022
Take care of yourself out there.

01:23:23.664 --> 01:23:24.600
You know...

01:23:27.802 --> 01:23:28.837
We could use some help.

01:23:34.042 --> 01:23:34.977
Coming?

01:24:08.879 --> 01:24:11.176
