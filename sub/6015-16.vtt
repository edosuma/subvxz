WEBVTT

00:00.969 --> 00:03.009
I never really understood...

00:03.050 --> 00:05.741
the importance of the conductor.

00:05.808 --> 00:09.662
Between you and me,
what the hell is this guy doing?

00:09.729 --> 00:13.791
Do you really need somebody
waving a stick in your face...

00:13.858 --> 00:17.128
to play the violin?
Does that really help you out?

00:17.529 --> 00:20.549
I could see how we need him
at the beginning, okay?

00:20.657 --> 00:22.217
Tap, tap, tap.

00:22.409 --> 00:25.512
"Start." Okay.
I could see how you need that.

00:25.579 --> 00:29.016
But once we're going, okay.
Once it's all happening...

00:29.083 --> 00:30.893
what do we need him for then?

00:30.960 --> 00:36.149
I don't see the cellist looking up,
"I'm confused. I don't know what to do."

00:36.216 --> 00:39.319
And the conductor goes,
"Do this. Like this..."

00:39.386 --> 00:42.197
"Oh, okay, thank you.
Thank you very much."

00:47.436 --> 00:49.538
Why try anymore?
There's no sense to it.

00:49.605 --> 00:51.749
I'll never meet anybody.
I should accept it.

00:51.816 --> 00:54.127
- Oh, yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

00:54.277 --> 00:56.713
Yeah, maybe you won't.

00:56.947 --> 01:01.009
It's hard enough to meet a woman
you dislike, much less like.

01:03.037 --> 01:05.180
- Are my nostrils getting bigger?
- No.

01:05.247 --> 01:09.435
See, why must it be so difficult?
Why all this tension and hostility?

01:09.502 --> 01:13.731
Why can't I just walk up to a woman
and say, " Hi, I'm George.

01:13.798 --> 01:15.900
How are you? "Is that so terrible?

01:16.176 --> 01:18.111
H... H... Hi.

01:18.553 --> 01:20.572
Hi. Hi.

01:23.892 --> 01:25.911
- There's no men out there.
- I know.

01:25.978 --> 01:29.957
The problem is that the good ones
know they're good.

01:30.024 --> 01:31.459
They know they're in demand.

01:31.526 --> 01:34.879
They're not interested in confining
themselves to one person.

01:34.946 --> 01:37.382
I hate the good ones.

01:37.449 --> 01:38.758
Is Jerry a good one?

01:38.825 --> 01:41.970
That's a good question.
I think he thinks he is.

01:43.497 --> 01:45.349
The mediocre ones are available...

01:45.416 --> 01:47.476
but so insecure
about not being a good one...

01:47.543 --> 01:49.770
that they always go,
"I'm not good enough for you.

01:49.837 --> 01:54.609
What are you doing with me?"
Eventually I just go,"You're right."

01:56.595 --> 01:59.281
Maybe you need somebody
between good and mediocre.

01:59.348 --> 02:01.325
No, maybe I need somebody
who has nothing.

02:01.391 --> 02:05.579
Somebody who just appreciates being
with me because he's so desperate.

02:09.317 --> 02:12.712
It's gotten to the point where I'm
flirting with operators on the phone.

02:14.322 --> 02:16.716
I almost made a date with one.

02:16.783 --> 02:18.385
Oh, so there's still hope.

02:18.535 --> 02:22.014
I don't want hope. Hope is killing me.

02:22.539 --> 02:25.184
My dream is to become hopeless.

02:25.251 --> 02:26.602
The hopeless don't care.

02:26.669 --> 02:29.563
When you don't care,
that indifference makes you attractive.

02:30.214 --> 02:33.651
- So hopelessness is the key.
- It's my only hope.

02:34.052 --> 02:36.613
You see, I wouldn't really mind
so much...

02:36.680 --> 02:38.406
but I feel badly for my mother.

02:38.473 --> 02:41.118
If my mother weren't around,
it wouldn't be so bad.

02:41.185 --> 02:45.372
But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married
by the time I'm 40, I'll have to kill her.

02:45.481 --> 02:48.793
Because it's the only fair thing to do.

02:49.443 --> 02:51.421
I just couldn't put her through that.

02:52.739 --> 02:54.549
At least you're not bitter.

02:55.742 --> 02:57.302
Who says I'm not bitter?

02:57.369 --> 03:00.681
- Aren't you too young to be bitter?
- No, you can be young and bitter.

03:01.373 --> 03:05.060
Just maybe not as bitter as I'll be
10 years from now.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.354
But I'm bitter.

03:07.672 --> 03:10.525
Anyway, don't tell anyone.

03:11.634 --> 03:14.779
Don't worry. Your bitterness
is safe with me.

03:15.221 --> 03:18.366
Okay. Order me a piece of cake.

03:18.642 --> 03:20.494
I'm gonna go throw up.

03:27.276 --> 03:28.627
Look at my hands.

03:28.778 --> 03:30.254
Look.

03:31.030 --> 03:32.548
Filthy from the paper.

03:32.866 --> 03:36.886
They should give you a Wet-Nap when
you buy one, like at those rib joints.

03:38.121 --> 03:40.849
- What did you do last night?
- Went out with George. You?

03:40.916 --> 03:42.726
Went out with Cynthia.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.311
What did you talk about?

03:44.420 --> 03:48.691
Oh, you know, the usual.
The Federal Reserve, the rain forest.

03:51.344 --> 03:53.529
Cynthia felt we should nuke
the rain forest.

03:53.596 --> 03:56.825
Get rid of it in one fell swoop
so we could eliminate it...

03:56.892 --> 03:58.952
as a subject of conversation.

03:59.978 --> 04:02.789
- What about you?
- We brushed on that.

04:05.067 --> 04:07.920
Actually, George was in rare form.

04:07.987 --> 04:10.506
He just can't find anybody.

04:10.573 --> 04:12.258
I know. Cynthia too.

04:12.325 --> 04:14.928
- She's really given up.
- George too.

04:20.291 --> 04:22.811
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, right.

04:25.422 --> 04:28.401
- I've never fixed anybody up.
- Me neither.

04:28.467 --> 04:32.113
And I am not about to
start with George.

04:34.557 --> 04:37.285
Well, why wouldn't you start
with George?

04:37.352 --> 04:39.079
You think she's too good for George?

04:39.271 --> 04:41.206
I didn't say "too good," did I?

04:41.273 --> 04:43.625
- You implied it.
- I didn't say it.

04:43.692 --> 04:45.628
If you think she's too good
for George...

04:45.694 --> 04:48.798
you are dead wrong. Dead wrong.

04:50.032 --> 04:51.717
Who is she?

04:51.868 --> 04:54.304
- Who is he?
- He's George.

04:54.704 --> 04:57.140
- She's Cynthia.
- So what?

04:58.166 --> 05:00.519
What, you don't think
she's beautiful?

05:01.003 --> 05:02.938
What's with the eyebrows?

05:05.174 --> 05:08.152
You know what your problem is?
Your standards are too high.

05:08.261 --> 05:09.946
I went out with you.

05:14.559 --> 05:17.746
That's because my standards
are too low.

05:20.566 --> 05:24.294
And by the way,
women kill for eyebrows like that.

05:24.361 --> 05:28.507
Do you know that?
Women pluck their real eyebrows...

05:28.574 --> 05:31.677
out of their head one by one...

05:31.744 --> 05:35.348
until they're bald, Jerry,
bald above the eyes.

05:35.415 --> 05:38.852
And then they paint in these eyebrows
to look like that.

05:38.919 --> 05:41.313
Well, let me tell you something
about George.

05:41.380 --> 05:43.524
He is fast.

05:43.716 --> 05:46.151
He can run like the wind.

05:46.302 --> 05:47.695
And he's strong.

05:47.762 --> 05:50.948
I've seen him lift 100 pounds over
his head without even knowing it.

05:51.307 --> 05:54.536
You wouldn't know it to look at him,
but George can bait a hook.

05:54.769 --> 05:57.122
- He can really do that?
- Come on, let's do it.

05:57.189 --> 05:58.957
I think they'll really get along.

05:59.024 --> 06:02.961
- What, are you into this?
- Yeah, come on, it's a good match.

06:03.028 --> 06:06.006
Wait. They'll be telling us how
their dates went.

06:06.073 --> 06:07.800
Are we gonna share
that information?

06:07.867 --> 06:09.385
Naturally.

06:10.953 --> 06:14.766
We're going to tell each other
everything? Every secret?

06:14.958 --> 06:16.309
Everything.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.855
- What if it worked out?
- Yeah, right

06:22.883 --> 06:26.570
Out of the question.

06:26.762 --> 06:30.074
- Why?
- No. I'm not going to do that.

06:30.224 --> 06:33.036
It's one step away from personal ads.

06:33.645 --> 06:35.246
Then prostitutes.

06:35.313 --> 06:38.917
No! No! I am not going
down that road.

06:44.365 --> 06:46.425
What does she look like?

06:47.660 --> 06:49.428
- She's good-looking.
- How good-looking?

06:49.495 --> 06:51.431
- Very good-looking.
- Really good-looking?

06:51.497 --> 06:54.058
- Really very good-looking.
- Would you take her out?

06:54.375 --> 06:56.102
- Yes, I would.
- You hesitated.

06:56.169 --> 07:00.023
- What hesitate? I didn't hesitate.
- Something's up. You hesitated.

07:00.090 --> 07:02.442
I'm telling you, she's good-looking.

07:03.218 --> 07:05.654
- What about the body?
- Good body. Nice body.

07:05.721 --> 07:07.865
- How nice?
- Nice. Pretty nice.

07:07.974 --> 07:11.452
- Really good?
- Really very nice and good.

07:17.067 --> 07:19.753
- What about personality?
- Good personality.

07:22.030 --> 07:23.966
Funny. Bright.

07:24.033 --> 07:26.093
I don't want anyone smarter than me.

07:26.160 --> 07:29.221
How could she be smarter than you?

07:32.208 --> 07:35.437
All right, let's see. Let's see.
What else? What else?

07:35.629 --> 07:37.522
What does she do?

07:37.839 --> 07:39.775
First of all, what does he do?

07:39.841 --> 07:41.652
He was in real estate.

07:41.718 --> 07:44.154
He's not working right now.

07:44.221 --> 07:46.949
Oh! He's not working?
No. No. No.

07:47.016 --> 07:48.951
How come he's not working?

07:49.018 --> 07:51.996
Well, I mean, he got fired.

07:52.063 --> 07:53.414
Why did he get fired?

07:57.777 --> 08:01.673
Oh, right. Well...

08:01.740 --> 08:05.010
He tried to... poison his boss.

08:05.077 --> 08:06.929
Excuse me?

08:07.413 --> 08:12.435
It's such a long story. Seriously,
he just had some problems at work.

08:12.502 --> 08:14.646
- Is he nuts?
- No, no, no.

08:14.713 --> 08:18.108
He's a really, really funny guy.

08:18.258 --> 08:19.693
What does he look like?

08:20.135 --> 08:23.030
- Pardon?
- What does he look like?

08:24.265 --> 08:26.951
Well, he's got a lot of character
in his face.

08:27.018 --> 08:30.705
He's short. He's stocky.

08:30.772 --> 08:32.123
He's fat.

08:32.190 --> 08:34.082
Is that what you're saying,
that he's fat?

08:34.275 --> 08:35.585
Powerful.

08:35.652 --> 08:41.674
He is so powerful. He can lift
100 pounds right up over his head.

08:41.825 --> 08:44.386
And, what else? What else?

08:44.453 --> 08:47.056
Oh, right, well...

08:47.123 --> 08:51.686
He's, he's kind of...
Just kind of... Losing his hair.

08:51.836 --> 08:54.772
- He's bald?
- No.

08:54.923 --> 08:58.068
No, no, no. He's not bald.

08:58.135 --> 09:00.070
He's balding.

09:00.262 --> 09:03.407
- So he will be bald?
- Yeah.

09:03.724 --> 09:07.077
- What kind of hair?
- You know, long, dark hair.

09:07.144 --> 09:08.704
Flowing?

09:09.856 --> 09:11.207
Flowing?

09:11.524 --> 09:15.670
Is it flowing? I like flowing,
cascading hair.

09:15.820 --> 09:19.299
Thick, lustrous hair
is important to me.

09:25.331 --> 09:27.266
"Thick, lustrous hair
is important to me."

09:27.333 --> 09:28.851
- Is that what you said?
- Right.

09:28.918 --> 09:30.645
Just clarifying.

09:31.754 --> 09:33.982
Let me ask you this.

09:38.345 --> 09:42.658
If you stick your hand in the hair,
is it easy to get it out?

09:46.187 --> 09:47.663
Do you want to get it out?

09:47.730 --> 09:50.291
Or do you want to not be able
to get it out?

09:50.983 --> 09:53.962
- I'd like to be able to get it out.
- I think you'll get it out.

09:54.821 --> 09:56.339
What about the skin?

09:56.406 --> 09:58.717
I need a good cheek.
I like a good cheek.

09:59.409 --> 10:01.345
She's got a fine cheek.

10:01.495 --> 10:03.138
Is there a pinkish hue?

10:06.041 --> 10:10.354
- A pinkish hue?
- Yes, a rosy glow.

10:10.838 --> 10:12.940
There's a hue.

10:13.675 --> 10:17.320
She's got great eyebrows.
Women kill to have her eyebrows.

10:19.181 --> 10:21.074
Who cares about eyebrows?

10:23.978 --> 10:26.497
Is she sweet? I like sweet.

10:26.814 --> 10:29.625
But not too sweet.
You could throw up from that.

10:32.946 --> 10:35.173
I don't think you'll throw up.

10:36.408 --> 10:38.802
She likes to throw up.

10:45.251 --> 10:47.770
- Has he ever been married?
- No.

10:48.504 --> 10:50.314
Has he been close?

10:50.757 --> 10:53.860
He once spent a weekend
with a woman.

10:57.264 --> 10:59.950
He didn't really try
to poison his boss.

11:00.142 --> 11:01.952
Yeah, he did.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.626
We had an incredible
phone conversation.

11:08.693 --> 11:10.503
We talked for, like, 20 minutes.

11:10.570 --> 11:13.548
I threw away my notes
in the middle of the call.

11:16.117 --> 11:18.470
I thought she had
a great voice timbre.

11:18.537 --> 11:20.055
Is it "timbre" or "tambre"?

11:20.122 --> 11:23.308
- I think it's tambre.
- Why'd I think timbre?

11:23.375 --> 11:24.977
She could do voice-overs.

11:25.044 --> 11:26.729
You didn't tell me about her voice?

11:26.796 --> 11:29.899
- I didn't notice the voice.
- It's mellifluous.

11:30.967 --> 11:32.652
So, Saturday night.

11:32.719 --> 11:35.071
She had to be impressed
by that conversation.

11:35.138 --> 11:38.116
It was a great performance.
I am unbelievable on the phone.

11:38.183 --> 11:42.996
On the date, they should just have two
phones on the table at the restaurant.

11:43.814 --> 11:45.624
- Hi.
- Hi!

11:46.484 --> 11:49.837
- Out we go Saturday night.
- I know.

11:49.904 --> 11:54.217
- So, what did she say?
- You're getting together Saturday night.

11:55.744 --> 11:57.929
- That's it?
- Yeah.

11:58.121 --> 12:01.558
- She didn't mention the conversation?
- No.

12:03.460 --> 12:05.562
See? I don't get that.

12:06.255 --> 12:09.650
We had a relaxed, stimulating, great
conversation. She doesn't mention it?

12:09.717 --> 12:11.068
- Why not mention it?
- What?

12:11.135 --> 12:12.820
She could have mentioned it.

12:12.887 --> 12:16.282
All right. All right. I'll go on the date,
but that's that.

12:21.688 --> 12:23.791
You know my friend Bob Sacamano?

12:23.857 --> 12:28.295
- The guy from Jersey.
- He just got a job at a condom factory.

12:29.363 --> 12:31.507
Look at this. He gave me a gross.

12:34.953 --> 12:38.265
- What will you do with all of them?
- Oh, well...

12:43.837 --> 12:45.481
Take some, Jerry. Grab them.

12:45.548 --> 12:48.484
No, thanks. They look like
they came out of a cereal box.

12:48.551 --> 12:51.904
Come on, Elaine, here.
Take half a bag.

12:52.764 --> 12:55.074
Half a bag?

12:55.225 --> 12:57.661
What am I, a hooker?

12:59.229 --> 13:01.582
Anyway, they look kind of cheap.

13:02.691 --> 13:04.877
I'll take one.

13:08.739 --> 13:10.383
It's possible.

13:11.617 --> 13:15.430
The problem with the condom
is still buying them.

13:15.497 --> 13:20.018
I think we should have, like,
a secret signal with the druggist.

13:20.085 --> 13:22.896
You walk into the store,
go to the counter. He looks at you.

13:22.963 --> 13:24.857
And if you go like this:

13:26.759 --> 13:29.320
He puts them in the bag
for you. That's it.

13:29.595 --> 13:33.074
Show up there with your little
shaving cream, your little toothpaste.

13:33.141 --> 13:34.742
"How are you today?"

13:38.105 --> 13:40.707
"Have a nice day." "You too."

13:43.027 --> 13:45.963
So where are they? It's 11:45.
They should be back by now.

13:46.030 --> 13:48.799
- What did they do?
- I think they went out to dinner.

13:48.908 --> 13:51.260
Oh, wait. I got another call.
That must be him.

13:51.327 --> 13:53.137
- Hello.
- It's me. I just got home.

13:53.204 --> 13:54.722
Hold on.

13:55.081 --> 13:58.059
- It's George. He just got home.
- Yeah. I got Cynthia on the line.

13:58.126 --> 14:02.147
- I'll call you back when I'm done.
- Remember our pact: Full disclosure.

14:02.214 --> 14:03.982
Of course.

14:04.466 --> 14:05.901
Yeah, go ahead.

14:06.552 --> 14:09.196
I'm gonna tell you,
but I made a pact with Cynthia.

14:09.263 --> 14:11.407
We swore we wouldn't tell
you and Elaine.

14:11.474 --> 14:13.743
- You can tell. I'll vault it.
- It's in the vault?

14:13.810 --> 14:16.997
I'm locking the vault. What? Come on.

14:18.231 --> 14:21.084
- We had sex.
- Oh, my God, you had sex?

14:21.151 --> 14:23.045
- How did that happen?
- I don't know.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.880
I closed my eyes and made a move.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.382
- At your apartment?
- Yeah.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.509
- She didn't stay over?
- No. She left.

14:28.576 --> 14:31.345
Listen, you can't mention
any of this to Elaine.

14:31.412 --> 14:34.224
Cynthia will kill me. We made a deal.

14:34.582 --> 14:35.934
Oh, my God.

14:36.001 --> 14:38.353
He was uncomfortable
because it was our first time.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.732
So he felt he'd perform better
if we did it in the kitchen.

14:41.799 --> 14:43.650
- What?
- He says the kitchen...

14:43.717 --> 14:45.653
is the most sociable room
in the house.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.113
And he was serious.

14:47.555 --> 14:50.408
- So how was it?
- How good could it be?

14:50.475 --> 14:52.827
My head was on a hot plate.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.288
I got another call. Must be Jerry.

14:55.355 --> 14:58.917
- Oh, don't you tell him any of this.
- Yeah, okay.

15:00.193 --> 15:02.880
- Hello?
- So, what did she say?

15:02.946 --> 15:05.966
- What did he have to say?
- He said he had a good time.

15:06.283 --> 15:08.552
- Her too.
- Oh, good.

15:08.703 --> 15:10.304
- Anything else?
- No.

15:10.663 --> 15:12.932
- You?
- No.

15:13.249 --> 15:15.685
- You sure?
- Yeah.

15:16.211 --> 15:18.980
- You?
- Yeah.

15:20.591 --> 15:23.444
All right, well...

15:24.053 --> 15:26.322
I guess everything is under control.

15:26.388 --> 15:28.783
Yeah. Okay then.

15:28.849 --> 15:30.284
Alrighty.

15:30.476 --> 15:32.036
- Good night.
- Good night.

15:35.732 --> 15:39.127
I left three messages.
I can't believe this woman.

15:39.194 --> 15:42.840
We have sex, she leaves 10 minutes
later, then I never hear from her again.

15:42.906 --> 15:44.717
What kind of a person does this?

15:44.867 --> 15:49.221
She used me. I feel cheap and violated.

15:53.668 --> 15:56.396
- I'm gonna do something about this.
- What are you gonna do?

15:56.463 --> 15:58.565
Never mind. Disgraceful.

15:58.632 --> 16:03.695
Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen
floor like some kind of roach trap.

16:04.054 --> 16:06.282
Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.

16:06.348 --> 16:08.659
Sir. Whatever.

16:09.143 --> 16:11.120
She's not gonna get away with this.

16:11.270 --> 16:14.916
I keep racking my brain
to try to figure out what I did.

16:14.983 --> 16:16.918
I was smart. I was funny.

16:16.985 --> 16:19.087
I made great small talk
with the waitress...

16:19.154 --> 16:21.840
so she could see I could relate
to the commoners.

16:21.907 --> 16:23.759
I'm a man of the people.

16:23.951 --> 16:25.552
- I'm gonna call her.
- Don't call.

16:25.619 --> 16:28.597
- No, I'm calling her.
- No, Jerry, I don't want you to.

16:28.664 --> 16:30.892
- Get away from me.
- Give me the phone.

16:30.958 --> 16:34.145
- You wanna fight me?
- Jerry, I'm gonna kill you.

16:34.212 --> 16:36.231
Hey, hey, hey!

16:36.298 --> 16:38.191
Hey, come on, Jerry, George.
Stop it.

16:38.300 --> 16:39.985
I'll just call her when you leave.

16:40.052 --> 16:41.403
It's none of your business!

16:41.470 --> 16:43.822
- It is so my business.
- Give me that!

16:43.889 --> 16:45.824
Stop it, boys!

16:48.936 --> 16:50.830
I don't want another word
from either of you.

16:50.897 --> 16:53.207
- Tell him...
- Hey, hey, hey!

16:55.318 --> 16:59.381
The next one of you that opens your
mouth, you'll have to deal with me.

17:01.325 --> 17:04.219
I bet I know what this is about.
It's about a woman, isn't it?

17:04.453 --> 17:06.096
- Yeah, but...
- You see!

17:06.163 --> 17:08.182
This is exactly what they want
to do to you.

17:08.249 --> 17:10.184
They play one against the other.

17:10.292 --> 17:12.353
You can't let them
manipulate you like that.

17:12.420 --> 17:13.938
- But, Kramer...
- No, no, no!

17:14.005 --> 17:15.898
I want you guys to shake hands.

17:16.049 --> 17:18.859
Come on, there are plenty women
out there for all of us.

17:19.010 --> 17:20.319
Shake.

17:20.512 --> 17:22.446
Yes! You see?

17:22.513 --> 17:25.409
Isn't that better than fighting?
Animosity?

17:25.476 --> 17:28.579
You wanna fight with somebody,
you fight with me.

17:30.064 --> 17:34.210
By the way, those condoms I gave you?
They're defective. Don't use them.

17:40.868 --> 17:42.177
- What?
- Yeah.

17:42.244 --> 17:44.263
- Defective?
- Defective.

17:44.330 --> 17:46.849
How could you give me
a defective condom?

17:48.125 --> 17:50.144
I didn't even know
they were defective.

17:50.211 --> 17:52.480
- Didn't think you'd use them.
- What do you mean...?!

17:53.631 --> 17:54.941
Take it easy.

17:55.008 --> 17:57.068
Just spread out!

18:05.686 --> 18:08.748
Don't worry. If anything was wrong,
she'd have called you.

18:10.441 --> 18:12.126
I missed my period.

18:12.902 --> 18:14.420
Oh, my God!

18:14.571 --> 18:18.425
I am very worried. I am never late.

18:18.575 --> 18:20.510
But he used a condom, right?

18:20.577 --> 18:23.555
I know, but these things
aren't always foolproof.

18:24.707 --> 18:26.851
Oh, no.

18:28.502 --> 18:29.937
What?

18:30.004 --> 18:31.522
Was it blue?

18:33.258 --> 18:35.527
Yeah. How'd you know?

18:36.761 --> 18:38.655
Just a hunch.

18:43.435 --> 18:47.915
It says "twist-off."
Twist off! Twist! Off!

18:49.609 --> 18:51.836
Oh, hi. Soda?

18:52.487 --> 18:54.172
No, thanks.

18:55.115 --> 18:56.841
So tell me.

18:56.908 --> 19:00.804
What's the problem with your little
flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?

19:01.663 --> 19:03.724
Who are you to talk
about her like that?

19:03.791 --> 19:05.851
She'll call him when she's
good and ready.

19:05.960 --> 19:08.062
- You don't even know her.
- Oh, I know her.

19:08.212 --> 19:09.605
I know her type.

19:10.131 --> 19:12.400
Her type? What type?

19:12.467 --> 19:14.110
The type that doesn't return calls.

19:14.177 --> 19:17.572
I knew we shouldn't have done it.
It was a bad idea. I told you.

19:17.639 --> 19:20.701
You told me? You pushed
this whole thing on me.

19:20.767 --> 19:22.202
It was your idea.

19:22.269 --> 19:24.705
I was just helping your bitter,
twisted friend.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.499
She's not bitter.

19:26.565 --> 19:28.501
Bitter's a judgment call.
She's twisted.

19:28.568 --> 19:32.088
Twisted? God, I did you a favour!

19:32.155 --> 19:35.175
You said they had a good time.
What else are you keeping from me?

19:35.241 --> 19:38.094
- Are you calling me a liar?
- I'm calling you one if you are.

19:38.161 --> 19:40.180
- Are you?
- Get your finger out of my face.

19:40.247 --> 19:42.474
- Get yours out.
- I don't care.

19:42.541 --> 19:45.102
Get out! Out! Out! Out!

19:45.169 --> 19:47.980
Hey, hey, hey! Come on, stop it!

19:48.047 --> 19:50.149
Come on. Break it up!

19:50.842 --> 19:52.235
Hey, hey!

19:52.719 --> 19:54.779
What's the matter with you?

19:55.805 --> 20:00.619
Now, don't you two see
that you're in love with each other?

20:02.980 --> 20:05.291
I mean, why can't you
face that already?

20:05.357 --> 20:08.294
You're running around looking
for something not even there...

20:08.361 --> 20:11.672
when everything you dream of
is right here in front of you.

20:11.739 --> 20:13.716
Now why can't you admit that?

20:14.325 --> 20:17.387
By the way, when you see George,
give him these. These'll work.

20:19.289 --> 20:22.559
I knew those condoms
were defective!

20:22.960 --> 20:25.896
How did you know
they were defective?!

20:26.088 --> 20:30.526
Because! Because she missed
her period!

20:30.968 --> 20:33.237
She missed her period?

20:36.558 --> 20:38.493
Oh, my God!

20:38.810 --> 20:40.704
I can't believe it.

20:41.063 --> 20:43.707
I'm a father! I did it!

20:43.774 --> 20:45.459
My boys can swim!

20:45.526 --> 20:49.755
I can do it! I can do it!
I'm a father!

20:54.744 --> 20:57.764
So he shows up. He's all out of breath.
He's dishevelled.

20:57.831 --> 21:02.311
And tells me that whatever happens,
whatever I decide is fine with him...

21:02.836 --> 21:04.396
and I could depend on him...

21:04.463 --> 21:07.817
and that he'd support me
in whatever way I need.

21:08.050 --> 21:10.820
Elaine, I was speechless.

21:11.220 --> 21:14.616
Wow. Wow. You see?
You think you know somebody.

21:14.682 --> 21:18.495
I said to him, " I really appreciate this,
but I just got my period."

21:18.562 --> 21:20.330
- Yeah.
- So I asked him to come in...

21:20.397 --> 21:21.873
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

21:21.940 --> 21:26.295
Sorry we're late. We got so
hung up in traffic. I'm sorry.

21:27.071 --> 21:29.215
- What happened?
- Acting.

21:31.993 --> 21:34.554
- Very mature.
- Thank you.

21:35.372 --> 21:36.973
- Hi, Cynthia.
- Hi.

21:37.040 --> 21:39.518
This is a great place to sit
you got here.

21:39.668 --> 21:42.020
Best seat in the house.
Right next to the kitchen.

21:42.087 --> 21:44.189
Oh, stop it. Stop it.

21:46.759 --> 21:49.820
- So, what are these?
- We ordered appetizers. Start eating.

21:50.304 --> 21:51.906
Oh, fabulous.

21:55.143 --> 21:57.245
This is good. Oh, this is good.

21:58.063 --> 22:00.332
Is that salt on this?

22:00.816 --> 22:02.709
Is there salt on this?

22:02.860 --> 22:04.837
But have you ever fixed anybody up?

22:04.904 --> 22:06.922
Why do we do it? Why?

22:07.323 --> 22:09.091
You thought
they'd have a good time...

22:09.158 --> 22:11.302
and a little power trip
for you, isn't it?

22:11.953 --> 22:13.346
Now you're playing God.

22:13.413 --> 22:16.599
Of course, God was
the first person to fix people up.

22:16.666 --> 22:18.685
He fixed up Adam and Eve.

22:18.752 --> 22:20.729
I'm sure he said to Adam,
"No, she's nice.

22:20.796 --> 22:26.443
She's... Yes, she's very free
about her body.

22:26.510 --> 22:28.779
Doesn't really wear much.

22:28.846 --> 22:32.241
She was going out with a snake.
I think that's over, though."
