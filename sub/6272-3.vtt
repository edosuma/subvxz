I can't conduct my research in a brothel,

46:14.502 --> 46:16.336
and this study will suffocate

46:16.370 --> 46:19.272
without the respectability
of this hospital.

46:19.307 --> 46:21.775
BARTON: Dear God,
you are a dog with a bone.

46:21.809 --> 46:25.612
WILLIAM: I'm more like a cash
cow to you... to this hospital.

46:25.646 --> 46:27.581
And I'm on the front page,
in case you hadn't noticed.

46:27.615 --> 46:30.750
That kind of publicity
could buy you a new wing...

46:30.785 --> 46:33.653
instead of a long and costly
lawsuit over four dead newborns,

46:33.688 --> 46:36.123
which is where you were headed
until I stepped in.

46:36.157 --> 46:37.757
BARTON:
Which is why I put you on the case.

46:37.792 --> 46:40.594
WILLIAM: I could just as easily,
uh, tell the press the truth...

46:40.628 --> 46:42.362
that you actually
put a fellow on the case.

46:42.396 --> 46:45.332
BARTON:
Do not fuck with me, Bill!

46:45.366 --> 46:47.134
Because when it comes
to throwing weight around,

46:47.168 --> 46:49.836
I will crush you into dust,

46:49.871 --> 46:52.139
even if I don't want to.

46:52.173 --> 46:55.642
Now, four babies are downstairs

46:55.676 --> 46:58.044
that wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

46:58.079 --> 47:00.680
It was a good day.
Go home to your wife.

47:00.715 --> 47:04.451
Come back tomorrow
to the job you were meant to do.

47:04.485 --> 47:05.619
WILLIAM:
[ Sighs ]

47:05.653 --> 47:07.487
You know, I met a young man
at the brothel...

47:07.522 --> 47:10.423
A prostitute, a homosexual.

47:10.458 --> 47:11.858
He came to see me last night.

47:11.893 --> 47:13.160
BARTON:
For Christ's sake, Bill.

47:13.194 --> 47:16.062
WILLIAM: He opened my eyes
to a few, uh, realities.

47:16.097 --> 47:18.532
BARTON: I mean it...
Spare me the lurid details.

47:18.566 --> 47:19.933
WILLIAM:
The men who pay to see him...

47:19.967 --> 47:22.769
They're not convicts or reprobates.

47:22.803 --> 47:25.639
They're not degenerates.

47:25.673 --> 47:27.607
They're family men,

47:27.642 --> 47:33.079
living a double life,
suffering in the shadows.

47:33.114 --> 47:34.548
I don't believe in shadows.

47:34.582 --> 47:37.684
I believe
in the light of scientific inquiry.

47:37.718 --> 47:41.788
I believe I have
a responsibility to those men,

47:41.822 --> 47:46.426
whether they're salesmen
or lawyers...

47:46.460 --> 47:50.797
or a provost of a major university.

47:56.637 --> 47:58.672
[ Sighs ]

48:00.675 --> 48:03.677
I'm begging you to reconsider.

48:03.711 --> 48:06.947
If not for my sake,

48:06.981 --> 48:10.483
then for those men in the shadows.

48:10.518 --> 48:13.119
BARTON:
What the hell is this, Bill?

48:14.722 --> 48:16.957
WILLIAM:
It's a necessary evil.

48:26.100 --> 48:28.569
BARTON:
Thought you'd gone AWOL.

48:29.036 --> 48:32.572
WILLIAM:
Uh, I'm not much for goodbye parties.

48:32.607 --> 48:33.873
BARTON:
[ Chuckles ]

48:33.908 --> 48:36.444
If they play "Meet Me in St. Louis"
one more time,

48:36.479 --> 48:39.795
- I'm gonna give myself an auriculectomy.
- WILLIAM: [ Chuckles ]

48:39.830 --> 48:41.581
Margaret looks happy.

48:41.616 --> 48:44.651
BARTON: Ah, wife of the new
provost of Washington University?

48:44.685 --> 48:48.255
She thinks she's Eleanor Roosevelt.

48:48.289 --> 48:51.858
WILLIAM:
Well... She'll be missed.

48:51.892 --> 48:53.193
BARTON:
Mm.

48:53.227 --> 48:56.062
WILLIAM:
You both... both will.

48:58.266 --> 49:00.100
BARTON: Dean Young tells me
that you you put in

49:00.134 --> 49:03.703
for a fellowship in Wash U's
obstetrics department.

49:03.738 --> 49:06.172
Wish I'd heard that from you.

49:06.207 --> 49:08.808
WILLIAM: Well, I-I didn't want
you to feel like, you know,

49:08.843 --> 49:11.331
you had to intervene.

49:12.046 --> 49:14.147
I don't...
I don't think I impressed them.

49:14.181 --> 49:16.283
BARTON:
Oh, they were impressed.

49:16.317 --> 49:17.617
They thought you were

49:17.652 --> 49:19.519
the most arrogant resident
they ever interviewed...

49:19.553 --> 49:22.856
A smug, self-satisfied horse's ass.

49:22.890 --> 49:25.592
- WILLIAM: Ah.
- BARTON: Yeah, "we can't take him

49:25.626 --> 49:28.528
because we'd have to build
a separate wing for his ego"...

49:28.562 --> 49:31.364
Something like that.

49:31.399 --> 49:33.533
- WILLIAM: I see.
- BARTON: [ Chuckles ]

49:33.567 --> 49:38.104
I, uh, I told Dean Young
he could take us both,

49:38.139 --> 49:41.007
or he could take the provost job
and shove it.

49:43.244 --> 49:46.212
So meet me in St. Louis?

49:52.019 --> 49:56.289
[ Chuckles ]
Bill...

50:01.929 --> 50:03.063
WILLIAM:
[ Sniffles ]

50:22.416 --> 50:25.985
The study will resume
tomorrow evening

50:26.020 --> 50:28.288
in the hospital.

50:31.525 --> 50:38.031
# Believe the stars
that fill the skies #

50:38.065 --> 50:41.935
# Are in my eyes #

50:41.969 --> 50:43.670
# Guess you feel #
[ Door opens, closes ]

50:43.704 --> 50:46.673
# You'll always be #

50:46.707 --> 50:50.577
# The one and only one for me #

50:50.611 --> 50:53.580
# And if you think you could #

50:53.614 --> 50:56.483
LIBBY:
So glad you're home, daddy.

50:56.517 --> 51:00.653
# Well, chances are,
your chances are #

51:00.688 --> 51:02.288
Sit down.

51:02.323 --> 51:07.594
# Awfully good #

51:07.628 --> 51:15.969
# The chances are,
your chances are #

51:16.003 --> 51:17.971
It's been a good day.

51:18.005 --> 51:25.211
# Awfully good #

51:26.305 --> 51:32.481
