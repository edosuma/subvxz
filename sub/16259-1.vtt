01:37.723 --> 01:39.393
<i>Home.</i>

01:40.350 --> 01:43.850
<i>They say once gone,
you can never return.</i>

01:44.896 --> 01:47.316
<i>But what about those like me?</i>

01:47.441 --> 01:51.941
<i>Born in the dust,
whose home was the road?</i>

01:52.195 --> 01:54.905
<i>No family with whom to share.</i>

01:56.491 --> 01:58.411
<i>Like my family,</i>

01:59.661 --> 02:04.161
<i>taken from me
by those whom I'd deceived.</i>

02:07.711 --> 02:10.800
<i>Tent and totem, I sold them a promise,</i>

02:10.922 --> 02:14.722
<i>and in return they sold me themselves.</i>

02:18.388 --> 02:20.428
<i>You see, orphans without a god</i>

02:20.557 --> 02:23.137
<i>will open their doors
to whomever might knock.</i>

02:24.394 --> 02:27.194
<i>Hammer and nail,
we build our heaven.</i>

02:28.273 --> 02:31.863
<i>Room by room... our hell.</i>

02:33.362 --> 02:35.322
<i>And so now we build.</i>

02:38.116 --> 02:41.446
<i>What a magnificent structure
it will be.</i>

02:57.177 --> 03:00.597
- Look, if this is about my copy...
- It's terrific. You're the best I got.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.772
You write like they wrote
back in the day.

03:02.891 --> 03:06.771
Cigarettes, little brown hats. Things
that say: "Scoop." No, I love your copy.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.685
- So what's this about?
- Your copy.

03:08.814 --> 03:09.984
Jesus, Chester!

03:10.107 --> 03:14.607
I put you on a story about
rising mortgage rates.

03:14.986 --> 03:18.356
You are a real estate writer, Talben,
not Woodward at the goddamn post.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.330
What I need from you are numbers.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.330
Re-fis, jumbos, rates.
What I don't need is color.

03:23.453 --> 03:26.833
Black's a color. White's a color.
It's all there in black and white.

03:26.957 --> 03:30.087
I'm just trying to make it interesting
for our three readers.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.800
This thing reads
like a murder investigation.

03:32.921 --> 03:36.261
- Then put me on crime.
- Doug's on crime. He's got scars.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.393
You got ambition and perfect skin.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.308
Still no Pulitzer?

03:44.224 --> 03:48.194
They don't give Pulitzers for commercial
occupancy rate reports, detective.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.401
You don't write, you don't call.

03:50.522 --> 03:54.072
I'd be writing now if I didn't have
a talkative cop giving me grief.

03:55.610 --> 03:56.860
Ok.

03:56.987 --> 03:59.817
The least I can do,
after you ate all my breakfast cereal.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.278
That was another lifetime.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.288
- I seem to remember us both there.
- What are you doing here?

04:04.411 --> 04:08.251
Eyewitness sketch for Doug. We're using
the press to flush out a suspect.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.713
How's Charlie doing? Any improvement?

04:10.834 --> 04:12.924
Working on it.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.924
We should catch up.

04:15.046 --> 04:17.086
Coffee? Bourbon?

04:17.214 --> 04:20.675
Raincheck me.
I have dinner at Amanda's house tonight.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.762
The sister who overcooks the vegetables.
Tsk.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.349
See you later.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.315
- There he is.
- Oh, you're home!

04:38.320 --> 04:40.160
Oh, no place I'd rather be.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.026
- Hey-
- hey-

04:45.452 --> 04:47.412
dinner's almost ready.
Wanna go wash his hands?

04:47.537 --> 04:50.037
- Sure. Come on, soldier.
- Yes, sir.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.922
- Any response on the story yet?
- Nothing fit to print.

04:57.047 --> 05:01.127
I might have a lead. I got a call from
this adoption agency in the northeast.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.589
The administrator read Charlie's story.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.095
Any luck on the donor list?

05:07.224 --> 05:08.774
Mom's our only hope.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.650
Who abandons their children?

05:12.771 --> 05:14.651
We're gonna find her.

05:14.773 --> 05:17.903
Even if she doesn't wanna be found.
Charlie will be ok.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.356
I promise.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.538
Ok. Close your eyes.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.501
Hands out.

05:29.621 --> 05:31.751
- Are you peeking?
- No, I'm not.

05:31.873 --> 05:34.383
Ok. Here.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.881
- But mom and dad won't let me.
- That's why it's gotta be our secret.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.719
Hey, look at me.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.474
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

05:48.139 --> 05:51.019
I promise. Ok?

06:17.002 --> 06:18.712
Lipstick on the collar is one thing.

06:18.837 --> 06:21.087
But the ink on your fingertips
wasn't all that different.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.884
The paper doesn't let its reporters
get engaged to cops,

06:24.009 --> 06:26.509
especially with a history
as complicated as ours.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.386
It's a fuck-all conflict of interest.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.603
I have a husband and a six-year-old.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.734
They conflict
with every interest I have.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.476
- Are you two gossiping?
- She's brooding.

06:36.605 --> 06:39.565
- I'm sulking. It's a whole new thing.
- About what?

06:39.691 --> 06:41.941
I'm ankle deep, and I'm going nowhere.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.358
- Doug has crime. I've got nothing.
- That's not true.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.278
You have us. Your family.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.157
Ambition. Your tenacity.
You got your hopes and dreams.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.445
Hell, I'd kill to have
my hope and dream back.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.369
Go start the laundry.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.540
I swear I feel like
I have two children sometimes.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.669
That's why I'm not married.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.700
Are you following me, detective?

07:30.825 --> 07:33.325
Stakeout.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.333
Following a person of interest.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.576
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know.
I shouldn't be here, but...

07:42.087 --> 07:43.457
...l didn't care.

07:43.588 --> 07:47.588
- You're right. You shouldn't be here.
- And I don't care.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.300
Old habits die hard.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.234
I need time, and you need to heal.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.771
You need to stop blaming yourself.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.015
You know, what happened...

08:01.147 --> 08:03.567
It can't...
Couldn't have been prevented.

08:03.692 --> 08:05.442
I sped it along.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.424
Julia, her and I were through
before there ever was a you and me.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.137
Aargh!

09:17.140 --> 09:20.770
- Charlie?
- Help me! Get off me!

09:21.978 --> 09:23.188
Charlie?

09:23.313 --> 09:26.153
No! No!

09:46.669 --> 09:49.509
There's a call for you. Line two.
The guy says it's urgent.

09:49.631 --> 09:53.801
Ok. Kyle, I'm gonna have
to call you back in five.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.805
<i>- This is Julia.
- Miss Talben?</i>

10:05.230 --> 10:06.860
Who is this?

10:06.981 --> 10:08.901
<i>I'm afraid
I've have done something terrible.</i>

10:10.235 --> 10:12.815
- I'm sorry?
- So am I.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.446
<i>Gravely.</i>

10:15.156 --> 10:16.696
To whom am I speaking?

10:16.825 --> 10:18.615
<i>I'm the man
who just killed your sister.</i>

10:33.133 --> 10:36.263
Amanda! She's not answering.

10:41.432 --> 10:42.772
Amanda!

10:42.892 --> 10:44.182
Jules, wait.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.478
Amanda?

10:54.904 --> 10:57.414
- Charlie?!
- Jules, do not go up those stairs.

10:57.532 --> 11:01.202
Shit. What the fuck did you do?

11:02.453 --> 11:04.793
Only what I had to.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.544
Oh, no.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.036
Amanda? Amanda?

11:09.460 --> 11:10.540
Charlie?!

11:17.719 --> 11:18.969
No...

11:19.095 --> 11:22.805
- Get down! Get down! Don't you move!
- No...

11:22.974 --> 11:24.734
You fuck! Do not move!

11:25.852 --> 11:28.482
- Jules?!
- ' No!

11:28.771 --> 11:30.311
Moving up!

12:52.272 --> 12:54.232
They were a beautiful family.

13:02.365 --> 13:04.525
You're all that I have left.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.829
You know the same is true for me, right?

13:08.246 --> 13:09.956
Come on. I'm driving.

13:18.047 --> 13:21.627
You should eat something.
Why don't we stop at castles?

13:21.759 --> 13:23.639
Get some of that pecan pie you like.

13:23.761 --> 13:27.351
- I wanna go to Renshaw's.
- Whoa, whoa, absolutely not.

13:27.473 --> 13:30.733
The last thing I wanna do
is bring more crazy into your life.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.019
Ok.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.476
I put my sister and her kid
in the ground today.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.977
I need the why.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.860
Renshaw is bat shit.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.607
Guys like that don't give exposition.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.700
No prize, no motive, no connection.

14:01.424 --> 14:04.804
- The bank sold the house?
- You said they were drowning in debt.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.297
I didn't say "drowning."
I said they had bills.

14:07.430 --> 14:09.390
Charlie's treatment is expensive.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.228
Was expensive.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.902
- They didn't own the house.
- The house owned them.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.276
It's been less than a week.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.315
You can't get through escrow that fast.

14:26.449 --> 14:30.949
Not to mention appraisal,
inspection, title, hud-1 form.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.040
It's just not possible.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.166
Right. A real estate journalist.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.110
Something doesn't feel right.

15:06.656 --> 15:07.736
Huh?

15:20.670 --> 15:23.090
Ls somebody in the house?

15:23.214 --> 15:25.594
It sounds like
it's coming from Charlie's room.

15:28.803 --> 15:30.763
Grady?

15:36.269 --> 15:38.649
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.782
Goddammit.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.263
Ok, ok. I know I owe you a call.

16:04.380 --> 16:08.010
Who the fuck buys a house, and cuts
the entire crime scene out of it?

16:08.134 --> 16:12.014
How is that legal?
How do you close escrow in five days?

16:12.138 --> 16:15.348
Give me the buyer.
Give me the information, Kyle.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.805
Or I will have consumer affairs
so far up your ass,

16:17.935 --> 16:19.935
they'll be brushing your teeth.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.623
A Po box in town?

16:34.118 --> 16:35.618
You need to start talking.

16:35.745 --> 16:38.535
Charlie's room is ripped
out of the goddamn house.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.964
You coming in here
talking about rooms being taken,

16:41.083 --> 16:43.923
that's like saying MacBeth
to a Broadway actor.

16:44.045 --> 16:47.965
You're gonna tell me a fairytale?
"Once upon a time"?

16:48.090 --> 16:49.930
Realtors are Glengarry guys.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.551
You don't have myths.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.813
Right when I started,
I caught this lead.

16:55.932 --> 16:58.772
Some high rise downtown.

16:58.893 --> 17:01.983
Only hitch was
that it was slightly infamous.

17:02.104 --> 17:06.364
Seems some husband went sideways
on his wife with a kitchen implement.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.290
Ohh!

17:18.913 --> 17:20.413
It was a crime scene?

17:20.540 --> 17:22.880
Oh, he made it one,
that's for damn sure.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.524
Unsellable, right?

17:39.475 --> 17:41.305
Two days later I'm closing escrow

17:41.435 --> 17:44.645
with a guy old enough
to be my great-great-grandfather.

17:45.523 --> 17:48.323
Less than a week later,
the old guy, he flips for a loss.

17:48.442 --> 17:51.282
- One renovation.
- The kill room is ripped out.

17:51.404 --> 17:54.494
Whole fucking room, gone.

17:54.615 --> 17:57.865
Now, you tell this tale,
you hear two more just like it.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.584
And the end of this fairytale
is always the same.

18:00.705 --> 18:04.995
Never heard from the buyer again.
I'd like to keep it that way.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.627
Found this in the closing papers.
That's all I got.

18:19.473 --> 18:23.853
Now wherever this leads,
make sure it's away from my office.

18:27.398 --> 18:30.858
Alright, you got the city records.
I did you a title search.

18:30.985 --> 18:34.235
12 hits on revelation holdings
over seven states.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.195
Your bus-bench huckster was right.

18:39.327 --> 18:43.827
Half a dozen properties bought and sold
by revelation over a 50-year span.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.750
And each one purchased...

18:47.877 --> 18:49.707
After a tragic event
occurred in the house.

18:49.837 --> 18:53.757
All of the homes did some sort of
remodeling after the crime took place.

18:53.883 --> 18:55.933
- And the rooms?
- Taken.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.967
So what's the explanation?

19:08.272 --> 19:11.442
When I moved in,
I didn't even have a roof over my head.

19:12.193 --> 19:16.243
- Why? What used to be up there?
- Vaulted ceiling being reinforced.

19:16.364 --> 19:17.914
Antique chandelier.

19:18.032 --> 19:22.042
- I started hearing noises.
- What kind of noises?

19:22.161 --> 19:26.331
It was in the hallway
across from the master bedroom.

19:26.457 --> 19:28.957
<i>There was an energy.</i>

19:29.085 --> 19:31.795
Family moved in late-'87, early-'88.

19:32.797 --> 19:35.797
Wasn't till three years later
that the tenants did the math.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.675
Points out the obvious.

19:37.802 --> 19:41.762
To hear the neighbors tell it, it was
a speakeasy, a brothel, a drug house,

19:41.889 --> 19:43.769
and who knows what else.

19:43.891 --> 19:47.731
If something could be done
to offend heaven, it was done here.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.693
- What's on the other side of this wall?
- Repairman was working late.

19:50.815 --> 19:53.475
<i>Forgot to cut the power on
the elevator. Crushed the poor bastard.</i>

19:54.944 --> 19:56.784
Damn near broke every bone in his body.

19:56.904 --> 20:00.624
I guess she reckoned she'd rather
go out above the ground than below it.

20:02.368 --> 20:06.868
But I did some research that ten years
before I took over the ownership,

20:07.915 --> 20:12.415
there was a nasty home invasion.

20:17.883 --> 20:22.383
Let us go! Please! Let us go!

20:22.513 --> 20:25.063
Please? Let us go...

20:30.980 --> 20:32.060
Shhh...

20:39.155 --> 20:43.525
Church bought the place back in '82
for a penny and a half.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.499
Poisoned by a competing tycoon.

20:46.620 --> 20:50.830
Someone came in and removed
the whole room, floor to ceiling.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.168
To understand the story,
two days after it happened,

20:53.294 --> 20:54.964
someone offered to buy the building.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.877
Owners wanted out,
didn't want the press, so they sold.

20:58.007 --> 21:01.587
And then someone just scampered off
with the entire ceiling?

21:01.719 --> 21:05.429
Two weeks later, elevator's gone,
and the building is back on the market.

21:06.223 --> 21:09.063
In your email you mentioned
something about revelation holdings.

21:09.185 --> 21:12.395
The newspaper did take up the story.

21:12.521 --> 21:16.981
And the day it went into print,
I get a knock at the door.

21:18.027 --> 21:20.817
<i>A man starts asking me questions.</i>

21:20.946 --> 21:25.446
<i>He's more interested in the murders
than the real estate.</i>

21:28.120 --> 21:32.620
<i>Two hours later, gives me a check
for 20 percent more than the value.</i>

21:34.960 --> 21:39.460
<i>And then the next week, I remembered
that I left a box over there.</i>

21:53.938 --> 21:56.768
<i>And the hallway was gone.</i>

21:56.899 --> 21:58.439
So let me get this straight.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.357
- The story bends.
- What do you mean it bends?

22:01.487 --> 22:03.987
Husband slits his wrists
after finding his wife dead in bed.

22:04.114 --> 22:07.284
Along comes an old man, buys the house,
rips out the murder room.

22:07.409 --> 22:10.999
Contractor shoots the carpenter
eight times in the head with a nail gun

22:11.121 --> 22:13.081
before putting a nail into his own eyes.

22:13.207 --> 22:16.337
- Nice touch, tools of the trade.
- Christmas morning, 2004.

22:16.460 --> 22:20.630
A husband and wife are opening presents
when their landlord axes them both.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.006
- And get this...
- Takes off with the murder room?

22:23.133 --> 22:24.433
Yes.

22:24.552 --> 22:26.472
Color me intrigued,
but that's about all.

22:26.595 --> 22:29.175
Fucked-up people
collect fucked-up shit, right?

22:29.306 --> 22:32.226
Part of his collection
happens to be my family.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.402
Which is horrible, but it's faded news.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.362
You can't rewrite that story.
It's already gone to press.

22:39.483 --> 22:42.033
Rewrite it?
I haven't even finished a rough draft.

22:43.821 --> 22:47.321
I get it. It's stranger than strange.
It's fucking nuts.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.699
But these are all solved murders.

22:49.827 --> 22:53.707
Cases of people taking out
their loved ones, and then themselves.

22:53.831 --> 22:56.381
We had your guy in a padded cell.

22:57.209 --> 23:01.169
He's facing triple murder. That's it.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.877
Case open, case closed.
There's no mystery.

23:04.008 --> 23:06.138
You don't have to protect me, Grady.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.310
I won't break.

23:12.474 --> 23:13.774
- I want to see him.
- No.

23:13.893 --> 23:14.983
- Yes.
- No.

23:15.102 --> 23:18.112
You don't get to make that decision.
I want to see him.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.148
Look...

23:21.817 --> 23:23.937
I know you're trying to make this right.

23:24.069 --> 23:27.779
But whatever it is you're doing,
it's not gonna bring them back.

23:28.866 --> 23:30.656
L just need to see him.

23:30.784 --> 23:33.374
If I don't see him
I'm gonna be asking these questions

23:33.495 --> 23:35.285
that I'm never gonna
have the answers to.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.674
So, please, help me. Please?

23:40.252 --> 23:44.132
Alright.
I'll... I'll make some calls, ok?

23:44.423 --> 23:46.633
You'll make some calls?

23:46.759 --> 23:48.389
You're a cop.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.600
You're my cop.

23:50.721 --> 23:52.601
And that was my sister.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.426
Get me in front of him.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.939
Shit. Fuck.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.582
The adoption agency.

24:24.046 --> 24:26.206
Mother: Eulalia Howard.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.133
New English.

24:47.528 --> 24:49.698
Some people can't do what you're doing.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.162
Believe me, I know what you're doing.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.985
43 stories I can confirm.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.910
The earliest one going back to 1953.

24:59.665 --> 25:02.535
My family's death was not random.
It's connected.

25:04.128 --> 25:06.168
Each time a shell company.

25:06.296 --> 25:08.546
No picture, no face.

25:08.674 --> 25:11.844
The guy's a ghost collecting ghosts,
and one of them is my sister.

25:12.261 --> 25:15.681
And this is where I warn you.

25:15.806 --> 25:18.426
You're getting too close
to this one, kiddo.

25:18.934 --> 25:23.104
And this is where I ignore you,
and chase it anyway.

25:29.987 --> 25:31.817
This came for you in today's mail.

25:35.993 --> 25:37.163
New English?

25:42.666 --> 25:44.706
"Always forward never reverse."

26:06.648 --> 26:10.898
I don't need to see anymore of this,
and nor do you. Who sent this?

26:16.742 --> 26:20.082
New English?
Renshaw's last address was new English.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.214
There's no such thing as a coincidence.

26:22.331 --> 26:26.711
The world broke, and you broke with it.
This is your head cobbling the pieces.

26:26.835 --> 26:29.415
That repairman Brent Johnson,
who was crushed.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.506
Guess where he was from? New English.

26:31.632 --> 26:33.932
The bathtub murders? New English.

26:35.677 --> 26:38.257
Guess where I was born?

26:38.388 --> 26:40.468
There's a connection.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.979
Look at the evidence and do the math.

26:43.727 --> 26:46.097
That's my sister and her family
on that tape.

26:46.230 --> 26:50.440
You have the monster behind bars
who did this. I am owed this, Grady.

26:50.818 --> 26:53.988
- What?
- The walls.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.703
What?

26:55.823 --> 26:57.913
Give me this.

27:00.702 --> 27:04.962
Look. Look at the walls.
They're not connected.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.169
The walls are not connected.

27:14.007 --> 27:17.177
Wing's under construction.
I had him moved here for you.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.512
A little more private, a lot more safe.

27:21.265 --> 27:24.425
Listen, he gets weird, you get scared,
I'll be right...

27:24.560 --> 27:26.560
- I'm fine.
- Don't get too close.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.609
Could I talk to him alone?

27:35.737 --> 27:40.067
- That ain't happening.
- Please? Just for a few minutes.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.950
I'm fine.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.997
Best I can do is down the hall.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.800
I don't remember the last time
I slept so well.

27:54.923 --> 27:57.433
You fucking monster.

27:59.261 --> 28:03.521
I am. And I feel terrible
about what befell your kin.

28:06.643 --> 28:10.773
I feel worse knowing
what will soon befall you.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.952
I'll watch you burn in hell
for what you did to them.

28:18.071 --> 28:21.201
I deserved that, and much worse.

28:21.325 --> 28:24.615
- That tape you sent me...
- I didn't send you any tape.

28:24.745 --> 28:26.615
Liar! Do not lie to me!

28:26.747 --> 28:28.367
I might have caused its creation,

28:28.498 --> 28:31.828
but I had no part in making it,
or sending it to you.

28:32.753 --> 28:36.303
I'm under lock and key here.

28:37.174 --> 28:39.554
- Her room was...
- Was taken.

28:39.676 --> 28:42.006
Like so many before it.

28:42.137 --> 28:44.717
I have made a barter with him.

28:44.848 --> 28:48.848
And now I have a room he cannot take.

28:49.937 --> 28:53.147
He who? Crone?

28:53.732 --> 28:56.282
Why did he take her room?

28:56.401 --> 29:00.111
Amanda's room fits into his puzzle.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.409
One more tragedy
to add to his collection.

29:04.201 --> 29:08.701
And some souls don't go above a level.
They're stuck.

29:10.707 --> 29:13.037
When a person dies unexpectedly,

29:13.168 --> 29:17.628
they leave behind a tear in the fabric
of our world like a fracture.

29:17.756 --> 29:22.256
You put enough cracks together,
like rooms in a house,

29:22.970 --> 29:27.270
all the pain, all the fear,
all the emotions

29:27.391 --> 29:29.561
left behind after death...

29:31.436 --> 29:33.516
...they start to turn acidic.

29:33.647 --> 29:38.147
And they echo on themselves
until finally it all collapses.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.282
Knock a hole in a prison wall,

29:42.406 --> 29:45.116
and walk out with all the prisoners.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.000
I'm sorry for what's coming.

29:51.373 --> 29:54.543
God, make it stop!
I have done a horrible thing.

29:55.585 --> 29:58.085
Owl

30:00.924 --> 30:02.014
agh!

30:02.134 --> 30:05.554
What is he building?
Please just tell me what he's building!

30:05.679 --> 30:07.599
The miracle of new English.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.480
<i>Listen to me.
I know the sky is falling for you.</i>

30:14.354 --> 30:16.654
But you need to back off,
and let me do my job.

30:19.401 --> 30:21.321
Go home.
I'll be five minutes behind you.

31:22.923 --> 31:24.013
Shit.

31:35.143 --> 31:36.603
License and registration.

31:38.814 --> 31:40.944
That's real clever. I like that.

31:42.192 --> 31:45.782
Care to put your feet up in our
well-appointed lounge while you wait?

32:00.710 --> 32:04.090
- Are you ok?
- Do I not look ok?

32:05.173 --> 32:06.723
Actually, no.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.799
If you're looking for service,
you have to go back

32:11.930 --> 32:14.310
about four miles in the other direction.

32:16.184 --> 32:19.814
Well, I'm actually just passing through
on my way to new English, officer,

32:19.938 --> 32:22.268
or is it trooper?

32:22.983 --> 32:24.783
It's sheriff.

32:24.901 --> 32:28.491
This is not a town you "pass through".
It's barely a town that you live in.

32:28.613 --> 32:31.373
What brings you
to this part of the world?

32:31.491 --> 32:34.791
I'm a real-estate reporter.
Just doing a little house-hunting.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.750
Well, here's some free reporting.

32:37.873 --> 32:41.503
Nothing's been built, bought,
or sold in new English in decades.

32:42.502 --> 32:45.132
All the houses are family-owned,
and passed down.

32:45.255 --> 32:49.585
And if it wouldn't be for that,
you'd be walking through a ghost town.

32:49.718 --> 32:52.718
My advice? Act as if you were.

33:02.731 --> 33:06.361
Miss Talben, if I seem inhospitable,
take it for hospitality.

33:06.485 --> 33:09.065
This is a small town.
They don't take much to strangers.

33:09.196 --> 33:10.856
Why's that?

33:12.407 --> 33:14.197
They're strange.

33:42.229 --> 33:43.649
Excuse me?

34:51.422 --> 34:53.513
Hello?

34:54.717 --> 34:56.257
Excuse me?

35:09.107 --> 35:10.897
We close in five minutes.

35:11.026 --> 35:13.276
Good day.

35:13.403 --> 35:16.573
I just need
archived birth and death records.

35:16.698 --> 35:19.868
You might actually know the person
I'm trying to find.

35:19.993 --> 35:21.493
Eulalia Howard?

35:22.621 --> 35:24.621
I don't know her.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.538
Never heard of her.

35:29.210 --> 35:30.790
Ok.

35:31.921 --> 35:36.421
How about local newspaper archives?
Town records?

35:37.427 --> 35:39.177
Local histories?

35:45.018 --> 35:48.348
Alright. Thank you for your help.
I'm just gonna show myself around.

35:48.480 --> 35:52.360
Well, as long as you show yourself
out that door in four minutes.

36:06.790 --> 36:08.330
That's my car!

36:11.419 --> 36:12.669
Goddammit!

36:31.189 --> 36:32.269
Ok, Howard...

38:01.696 --> 38:03.776
Jesus! You scared me.

38:03.907 --> 38:05.697
I have that effect on people.

38:06.576 --> 38:08.406
Alicia.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.956
Call me Allie, or I will grimace!

38:12.081 --> 38:14.331
- Julia.
- On.

38:14.459 --> 38:15.999
Julia.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.883
I don't meet many strangers.

38:19.756 --> 38:21.416
Oh.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.839
You are making me uncomfortable, Julia.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.428
Oh.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.513
I'm sorry. I was starting to think that

38:27.639 --> 38:30.139
no one in new English
had any social graces.

38:30.266 --> 38:33.596
This town soured
long before you were born, dear.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.058
I could tell by the warm welcome.

38:35.188 --> 38:37.688
Frigid, right? Well, fuck 'em!

38:37.816 --> 38:42.316
Town this small, this old,
you can measure its age in secrets.

38:43.613 --> 38:46.033
Like the rings on a redwood.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.777
What brings you to me?

38:48.910 --> 38:51.410
Eulalia Howard.

38:51.538 --> 38:53.538
She was my mother.

38:54.415 --> 38:56.455
Julia.

38:56.584 --> 38:59.424
Hate to be the one brings you this news.

38:59.546 --> 39:03.256
But cancer took Eulalia
about 30 years back.

39:03.383 --> 39:06.093
I bought her property back in '85.

39:06.845 --> 39:09.005
You knew her?

39:09.138 --> 39:11.138
In passing.

39:11.266 --> 39:13.976
A town this small,
everybody knows everybody.

39:18.898 --> 39:23.358
Well, I think it's time you headed back
to where you come from.

39:24.529 --> 39:25.659
I'm Sony?

39:25.780 --> 39:29.070
Best thing you could do
is put this town in your rear view.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.410
Now go.

39:31.536 --> 39:33.656
I buried my sister
and her entire family last week.

39:33.788 --> 39:36.998
So, I will leave your porch,
but I am not leaving new English.

39:39.127 --> 39:41.127
Oh, Julia.

39:44.549 --> 39:47.219
Your face, as pretty as it is,

39:47.343 --> 39:51.183
it might be the last new thing
that I ever see.

39:51.306 --> 39:55.476
So, a blanket and a bed,
that's the least I could do, right?

39:55.602 --> 39:57.272
Come on in.

39:57.395 --> 40:00.015
After you, milady.

40:01.983 --> 40:03.233
So...

40:04.277 --> 40:06.647
At one point,
this was a bed and breakfast.

40:06.779 --> 40:10.239
That being said, you are my first guest.

40:11.367 --> 40:13.487
All these vintage things.

40:13.620 --> 40:15.580
It's like the inside of my head.

40:16.539 --> 40:19.789
Remind me to clean this place.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.223
Oh, forget that.

40:27.342 --> 40:30.762
You'd do better out here with a tin can
and a really long piece of string.

40:30.887 --> 40:33.597
- So, no-go on cellular, huh?
- No-go, no-go, no-go.

40:33.723 --> 40:36.563
No cable, no gridlock, no fast food.

40:36.684 --> 40:41.184
And no deal till you drink with
the town witch. Come to poison you.

40:44.275 --> 40:47.185
- How do you like your Whisky?
- In a glass.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.200
Perfect.

40:52.909 --> 40:54.239
Thank you.

40:54.369 --> 40:55.789
Cheers, Julia.

40:55.912 --> 40:57.252
Cheers.

40:58.373 --> 41:00.043
So are you from new English, Allie?

41:02.627 --> 41:03.707
Mmm.

41:05.964 --> 41:08.844
Born, raised, and surely will die.

41:12.053 --> 41:14.723
Are they doing construction
out on the forest?

41:14.847 --> 41:18.927
- Cut right to the chase.
- Help me fill in the blanks, please.

41:23.314 --> 41:26.034
You should have seen this town
in its day.

41:27.443 --> 41:30.653
Now it's dying by decades.
Year by year.

41:30.780 --> 41:35.280
It's shrinking like the skin
on my bones. I'm an old woman now.

41:35.618 --> 41:37.408
Old face, old hair, old hands.

41:37.537 --> 41:41.167
Big veins, feet that feel like
they're a thousand years old.

41:41.290 --> 41:44.000
Wasting away just like this town.

41:46.295 --> 41:48.505
Allie, who's Jebediah Crone?

41:53.386 --> 41:57.886
What's the point of having secrets...
If you got no one to share them with?

42:03.980 --> 42:06.980
Terrible thing to die before your time.

42:07.108 --> 42:10.028
The only thing worse
is dying on your feet.

42:10.153 --> 42:12.163
That was us back then.

42:17.326 --> 42:19.076
But worst of all...

42:20.371 --> 42:23.461
...is watching your children
die before you.

42:26.919 --> 42:30.089
You remember how
the dust bowl preachers of the 1930s,

42:30.214 --> 42:34.714
they came into the wasteland,
and they gave people god?

42:34.886 --> 42:38.256
The <i>grapes</i> of wrath. I read the book.

42:38.389 --> 42:40.099
Well, Jebediah Crone...

42:42.185 --> 42:46.265
He came from the wasteland,
and he took god from us.

42:46.606 --> 42:48.936
For a moment of his glory, this.

42:49.067 --> 42:51.647
There's the public record
you can see at the library.

42:51.778 --> 42:53.908
And then there is my record.

42:55.114 --> 42:57.324
There's things that I save.

42:58.576 --> 43:02.366
Things that this town...
Might wish lost.

43:03.289 --> 43:06.669
Should have burned this. Surely
would destroy a lot of people's lives.

43:06.793 --> 43:08.173
Here.

43:13.883 --> 43:15.433
Allow me.

43:16.511 --> 43:18.301
I love old things.

43:19.305 --> 43:22.555
Then you're gonna love new English.

43:27.313 --> 43:30.653
When the town fell, we all fell with it.

43:30.775 --> 43:32.435
We got broke. We got sick.

43:32.568 --> 43:35.448
We blamed each other.
We blamed ourselves.

43:35.571 --> 43:38.321
Then came Crone with an answer.

43:40.952 --> 43:44.002
He said: "Blame god."

43:50.086 --> 43:53.376
<i>So much has been taken from you,
from this town.</i>

43:53.506 --> 43:56.586
<i>From god-fearing people.</i>

43:57.677 --> 44:01.847
To understand Jebediah Crone,
you can't hear just about the man.

44:01.973 --> 44:03.893
You have to hear the man himself.

44:04.016 --> 44:06.136
<i>False scripture you have in your hands.</i>

44:06.269 --> 44:08.979
<i>Make a testament
to what you hold most dear.</i>

44:09.730 --> 44:12.400
<i>The loved ones,
your homes, your children!</i>

44:12.525 --> 44:14.525
Write it down. Put it on parchment.

44:14.652 --> 44:16.702
Hold it high
for this counterfeit god to see!

44:16.821 --> 44:18.531
Hallelujah!

44:18.656 --> 44:22.196
<i>Now, my children,
in this time of destitution...</i>

44:23.619 --> 44:25.079
<i>...tainted by ruin...</i>

44:25.872 --> 44:29.462
<i>...we have struggled,
and been stolen from.</i>

44:29.584 --> 44:32.004
<i>Denied ourselves and been left empty.</i>

44:33.171 --> 44:36.631
<i>Send up a prayer, like a child's
balloon, like prideful Icarus,</i>

44:36.757 --> 44:38.547
<i>and watch it burn before heaven.</i>

44:38.676 --> 44:42.296
<i>But bury it deep in rot, in filth,
and watch it take root in hell.</i>

44:42.430 --> 44:45.680
He'd opened our eyes,
and blinded us at the same time.

44:45.808 --> 44:50.228
Gave us control without morals.
Or mercy.

44:50.354 --> 44:54.784
It's unspeakable, the things
a person will do not to feel powerless.

44:54.901 --> 44:58.491
So imagine what
a thousand might do together?

44:58.988 --> 45:01.658
<i>That sacrifice is required.</i>

45:01.782 --> 45:04.582
<i>This ailing boy, so undeserving,
can indeed be healed!</i>

45:04.702 --> 45:08.962
<i>As this town can be made whole again
by power and pleasure!</i>

45:09.081 --> 45:13.581
<i>By wealth and dominion!
But first, lambs must rise to lions!</i>

45:14.045 --> 45:17.255
<i>Beg miracles from murder!
For hell demands a sacrifice!</i>

45:18.174 --> 45:21.514
<i>You, boy! You with your camera!</i>

45:21.636 --> 45:25.966
<i>Filming, judging, offering nothing.
Stealing souls one frame at a time!</i>

45:26.098 --> 45:27.598
You wait here.

45:31.187 --> 45:33.187
<i>Oh, god, please! Christ, no!</i>

45:34.607 --> 45:37.687
- May I help you?
- Ls Julia here?

45:37.818 --> 45:40.648
Julia who?

45:40.821 --> 45:43.491
I know she's here.
Are we gonna play this game?

45:44.450 --> 45:45.870
Grady.

45:47.995 --> 45:50.535
- A friend of yours?
- Yeah.

45:56.921 --> 45:58.711
Call me if you need me.

46:00.841 --> 46:02.721
Jesus Christ. What happened to you?

46:02.843 --> 46:05.393
I've been trying to call you
for six goddamn hours.

46:05.513 --> 46:07.773
You're a writer.
Write me a list of your friends.

46:07.890 --> 46:10.350
Not your sources, or contacts,
but your friends.

46:10.476 --> 46:13.146
I bet you it's a really short one.
Am I even on it?

46:13.271 --> 46:14.441
You're the last one.

46:15.982 --> 46:18.572
- How did you find me?
- Welcome to the 21st century.

46:18.693 --> 46:21.453
- I'm a cop and you're an open book.
- I'd make an awful criminal.

46:21.570 --> 46:24.320
Yeah. Well, you'd make
an even worse victim.

46:24.448 --> 46:26.068
Listen to me.

46:26.200 --> 46:30.250
No matter how many times you leave,
or how far you go,

46:30.371 --> 46:34.291
turn around and look behind you,
that shadow's gonna be me, ok?

46:35.751 --> 46:38.801
Now, can I come in,
or do I have to go scare up a warrant?

46:38.921 --> 46:41.761
Please, join us.

46:42.883 --> 46:45.093
- Mister...?
- Detective Declan Grady, ma'am.

46:45.219 --> 46:47.139
Cut out the "ma'am" shit.

46:47.805 --> 46:51.595
My name is Allie. And this is my house.

46:53.102 --> 46:54.982
Now, if you'd like to come in.

46:56.897 --> 46:58.977
This way.

46:59.650 --> 47:03.400
Hey, this dance we're doing
has a pretty short song.

47:03.529 --> 47:05.569
Comes a time, we don't move forward,

47:05.698 --> 47:08.868
we're just gonna be two people
standing in the dark, ok?

47:12.663 --> 47:14.623
I need you to show you something.

47:17.710 --> 47:19.710
<i>Get off me! Christ, no!</i>

47:22.590 --> 47:24.590
<i>God doesn't come.
Your savior doesn't save!</i>

47:24.717 --> 47:26.637
<i>You're in his house,
and yet he turns his back.</i>

47:26.761 --> 47:28.801
<i>You call his name
and he does not answer.</i>

47:28.929 --> 47:31.679
<i>Darkness, Grant life from life,
blood from blood</i>

47:31.807 --> 47:35.767
<i>that this useless flesh might yield
useful hands and do your work.</i>

47:35.895 --> 47:38.555
<i>- Will you fall with me, children?
- Yes!</i>

47:38.689 --> 47:41.109
<i>Will you rip from this boy
as you would from the world?</i>

47:41.233 --> 47:43.443
<i>- Yes!
- So be it!</i>

47:53.079 --> 47:55.119
Ah, Jesus!

47:55.247 --> 47:59.287
Was nowhere to be found that day.
Or any day that followed.

47:59.418 --> 48:01.878
Jebediah Crone had been to hell.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.920
And he brought back with him...

48:06.300 --> 48:08.090
...some of his secrets.

48:09.303 --> 48:12.603
<i>Stand, son.
Receive the blessing due you.</i>

48:20.356 --> 48:24.776
Sacrificing that man
gave a cripple the ability to walk.

48:25.486 --> 48:29.986
And it was through sacrifice
that we would rebuild new English.

48:30.491 --> 48:33.701
<i>Let this be a testament
to the power of self.</i>

48:33.828 --> 48:36.158
<i>Now that you have seen this power,
know this:</i>

48:36.288 --> 48:40.328
<i>If heaven is a house of many rooms,
we shall build a hell of many more.</i>

48:41.419 --> 48:45.009
<i>To restore new English,
we shall build a great monument.</i>

48:46.048 --> 48:48.838
<i>Tall and terrible and absolute.</i>

48:48.968 --> 48:53.058
<i>That would make god writhe in awe,
and Satan weep with envy.</i>

48:53.180 --> 48:57.560
<i>That will memorialize ourselves
in life and death.</i>

48:57.685 --> 49:02.145
<i>Are you willing to build this
foundation on the bones of angels?</i>

49:03.774 --> 49:06.404
<i>Anoint yourself. Deliver yourself.</i>

49:08.654 --> 49:10.324
What the hell is this?

49:12.283 --> 49:16.783
It's the miracle that Jebediah Crone
provided to new English.

49:18.497 --> 49:22.917
Better living through sin and sacrifice.

49:23.043 --> 49:26.463
- The town killed the man.
- And many more after that.

49:26.589 --> 49:28.589
The town made a pact with Crone.

49:28.716 --> 49:32.676
We all did, but we pledged more
than we had the power to give.

49:32.803 --> 49:37.303
Oh, Julia. I've seen and done
far worse things than you.

49:37.683 --> 49:39.893
But I have lived past giving a shit.

49:41.854 --> 49:44.314
But this town has not.

49:46.692 --> 49:48.822
It's fearful.

49:50.905 --> 49:54.905
And there's nothing more dangerous
than something that's afraid.

50:48.671 --> 50:50.171
Hey.

50:50.297 --> 50:52.507
Put this on. You must be freezing.

50:55.761 --> 50:57.891
Do you believe me now?

50:59.014 --> 51:01.024
I always believed you.

51:02.351 --> 51:05.401
- Thought you didn't have service.
- I don't.

51:08.566 --> 51:12.316
- Just press play.
- Jules, I've already seen this video.

51:12.444 --> 51:14.114
I'm still trying to forget it.

51:14.238 --> 51:16.318
Please, watch it again.

51:16.448 --> 51:19.408
What am I looking for here?

51:19.535 --> 51:22.155
The walls were already bloody
before the attack.

52:10.878 --> 52:15.218
The room, it doesn't look right.
It doesn't look the same.

52:15.341 --> 52:18.261
It's like it's... staged.

52:19.303 --> 52:21.893
Alright, look. I did make some calls.

52:22.014 --> 52:24.774
Pulled some favors
and wound up with this.

52:30.856 --> 52:34.526
"Dorothy and Cecelia Crone were laid
to rest in Brookline cemetery today.

52:34.652 --> 52:36.902
Survived by reverend Jebediah Crone,

52:37.029 --> 52:39.909
still in a critical condition
at mercy falls hospital."

52:40.032 --> 52:44.042
- How did I miss this?
- Now get this fascinating little extra.

52:44.161 --> 52:45.831
Crone died twice.

52:45.954 --> 52:48.754
Flat-lined from a gunshot before
his ticker starting beating again.

52:48.874 --> 52:51.334
What the fuck is that?

52:51.460 --> 52:53.550
Jesus Christ!

52:54.630 --> 52:58.550
Anyway, somebody didn't like
the snake oil the old man was selling,

52:58.676 --> 53:01.386
and he capped the whole fucking family
in front of him.

53:03.639 --> 53:05.599
What?

53:05.724 --> 53:07.814
That's what Allie said.

53:09.144 --> 53:11.904
"He went to hell,
and he brought back its secrets."

53:13.982 --> 53:15.902
You gotta be kidding me.

54:25.429 --> 54:26.759
Grady?

54:47.493 --> 54:49.753
Shall we finish what we started?

54:53.665 --> 54:55.285
Allie?

55:02.257 --> 55:06.427
- Grady?
- Shh. You stay here.

55:17.940 --> 55:21.070
Allie? Allie?

55:24.738 --> 55:27.988
Allie? Shit!

55:29.576 --> 55:31.486
She stole my fucking car!

55:35.499 --> 55:36.749
Shit.

55:40.212 --> 55:41.592
Hey, you!

55:44.800 --> 55:47.260
Don't move! Oh, god! Shit!

55:51.056 --> 55:52.966
Get back in the house. Go! Now!

56:03.318 --> 56:04.648
Grady?

56:26.758 --> 56:29.178
We have to get out of here.
Get away, get home, now.

56:29.303 --> 56:32.513
I can rain my own hellfire
on this place. SWAT, feds, whatever.

56:32.639 --> 56:37.059
I can swing a big fucking hammer,
but not with you still here. Let's go.

56:45.444 --> 56:47.454
Who doesn't have a goddamn phone?

56:47.571 --> 56:49.991
Somebody that doesn't wanna be found.

56:50.115 --> 56:52.945
What's wrong? What?

56:55.203 --> 56:57.293
You know this person?

56:59.458 --> 57:01.208
Look at that woman.

57:03.587 --> 57:06.967
- Is this Allie?
- And Amanda, and me.

57:09.593 --> 57:12.353
She lied to me. She's my mother.

57:15.223 --> 57:18.813
Ok, look, we gotta go now.
Alright? Let's go. Come on.

57:20.145 --> 57:21.765
Jules...

57:23.815 --> 57:28.315
What kind of paper stops publishing in
1981, and then starts back up in 1987?

57:29.154 --> 57:31.704
No clue.
Can we talk about it on the way out?

57:32.908 --> 57:36.618
The school fire. It happened
two weeks after Crone showed up.

57:36.745 --> 57:38.405
February 11th, 1981.

57:38.538 --> 57:41.368
All of the kids died,
and there were no survivors.

57:42.417 --> 57:44.747
He collects tragedies.

57:44.878 --> 57:47.758
This entire town is a tragedy.

57:47.881 --> 57:50.631
Renshaw said Crone
was collecting cracks.

57:50.759 --> 57:53.929
"Put enough cracks together,
and they turn acidic."

57:54.054 --> 57:55.564
Fucking Renshaw.

57:55.681 --> 57:58.771
He said knock a hole in the prison wall,
and walk out with the prisoners.

57:58.892 --> 58:02.692
- How old was Amanda in '81?
- I don't know. Seven? Why?

58:02.813 --> 58:06.073
Old enough to attend that school, right?
If you match the dates.

58:08.819 --> 58:11.069
Amanda should have died in that fire.

58:13.198 --> 58:15.738
Alright, listen to me.
The town's three miles away.

58:15.867 --> 58:18.787
We're getting out, and I'm calling it
in. Let's go. Come on.

58:18.912 --> 58:22.542
I think my dad was onto something.
He tried running. Got us both out.

58:22.666 --> 58:25.086
- Out of new English?
- Yes, out of this town.

58:25.210 --> 58:28.090
No, dear. He was running from me.

58:29.047 --> 58:30.167
Fuck!

58:37.639 --> 58:40.349
Allow me to introduce myself.

58:40.475 --> 58:44.475
My name is Jebediah Crone,
and this is my card.

58:44.604 --> 58:48.364
One inch forward, six feet down.
You understand, old man?

58:48.483 --> 58:51.153
Oh, I've been there before.

58:51.695 --> 58:54.655
Minor inconvenience, death.

58:55.240 --> 58:57.740
Make no mistake,
I will shoot you in the fucking head,

58:57.868 --> 59:00.368
and sleep like a baby tonight.

59:01.455 --> 59:03.745
I enjoy your writing, miss Talben.

59:03.874 --> 59:08.174
Especially the lovely tale
about the mother of the afflicted child

59:08.295 --> 59:10.955
searching for her birth parents.

59:11.089 --> 59:12.969
Made my heart weep.

59:13.091 --> 59:15.761
You collect words
the way I collect rooms,

59:15.886 --> 59:18.046
and the damned that wander them.

59:18.180 --> 59:19.810
We are, both of us...

59:21.558 --> 59:24.348
...clear in our pursuits.

59:24.478 --> 59:28.358
We both want a reunion
with those close to our hearts.

59:28.482 --> 59:31.902
L just have to go further to get mine.

59:32.027 --> 59:36.527
Tell me, dear, have you found
what you're looking for yet?

59:36.782 --> 59:40.122
- I'm excited to know.
- You took them from me!

59:42.496 --> 59:45.786
I took nothing from you, miss Talben.

59:47.084 --> 59:49.344
Just purchased a piece of real estate.

59:49.461 --> 59:51.841
No crime in that.

59:51.963 --> 59:54.473
Don't you move.

59:59.471 --> 01:00:02.101
Amanda's death itself, a tragedy.

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:04.434
True. Tragic.

01:00:04.559 --> 01:00:08.599
But a promise fulfilled.
A debt collected.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:10.690
Don't you dare say her name.

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:16.025
Ah, family is truly the only real
heaven you'll ever know.

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:21.579
I'm gonna find out
what you're doing, I promise,

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:24.041
and I'm gonna burn it
to the fucking ground.

01:00:24.913 --> 01:00:29.413
Oh, I know a few things about fire,
miss Talben.

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:32.053
Spent time in the flames.

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:36.670
Watched as they flickered
and danced and consumed things.

01:00:38.844 --> 01:00:42.934
Fire has a way of... motivating you.

01:00:44.099 --> 01:00:47.059
What kind of hold do you have
on these people and this town?

01:00:47.853 --> 01:00:52.353
I'm sure you've heard the old saying:
"Tragedy brings folks together".

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:56.438
I can assure you the verity
of that statement.

01:00:57.237 --> 01:01:00.567
It was the tragedy that bound this town.

01:01:02.242 --> 01:01:06.622
It is one last tragedy
that will set them free.

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:11.749
If it brings you any comfort,
miss Talben,

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:15.297
know that Amanda and Charlie live on,
and Felix, too.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:21.930
- But you've seen the video.
- What the fuck did you just say?!

01:01:25.223 --> 01:01:27.353
Weapon on the deck! Now!

01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:29.765
Hands high, fingers spread,
so I can see 'em.

01:01:29.895 --> 01:01:34.355
- Do it, slick!
- I'm a cop, goddamn it!

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:38.154
What'd you do? Call in reinforcements?
I thought I asked you to leave.

01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:41.698
Sheriff, you're harboring a criminal
who's just run off into the woods.

01:01:41.823 --> 01:01:45.373
The woods around these parts
tend to take more than they give.

01:01:45.493 --> 01:01:47.373
What do you two hope to accomplish?

01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:50.205
Aren't you the goddamn law in this town?
Huh?

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:53.592
They're constructing something
in the forest.

01:01:54.586 --> 01:01:57.256
But you already know that, don't you?

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:01.220
This town and its wellbeing
is my concern, not yours.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:04.643
And that out there...

01:02:06.181 --> 01:02:09.181
...that's the past unburying itself.

01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:13.099
And you do not lend it a shovel.
Do you read me?

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.690
- Do you read me?
- Yeah, I read you.

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:25.777
Alright.

01:02:27.035 --> 01:02:30.535
Eddie'll be here in about 45 minutes
to unhook you.

01:02:32.123 --> 01:02:36.133
Get your car. Be on your way.
Get out of town.

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:39.013
Not later, not in a few hours. Now.

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:42.170
I promise you, if I see you again
you'll be wearing handcuffs.

01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:45.762
Has anyone ever found this thing?
Whatever the fuck it is he's building?

01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:48.007
Do you think
you're the first one to look?

01:02:48.139 --> 01:02:51.139
First one to hear a rumor,
stretch a tall tale?

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:55.601
Some folks come out,
their eyes all glassed over.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:58.440
Some folks come out
and put a bullet in their mouth.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:02.146
Most just come out
with a bad case of poison sumac,

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:03.949
and they itch like the very devil.

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:08.695
I'll keep an eye out for your car,
detective, but don't hold your breath.

01:03:09.244 --> 01:03:12.914
Follow the highway home.
Live a full life.

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:17.253
Don't come back to new English.

01:03:18.169 --> 01:03:20.049
Thanks for the tip.

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:23.166
Jerk-off.

01:03:37.105 --> 01:03:39.145
They're hiding something.

01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:40.944
This entire town.

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:50.239
You know what? It's time we found out
what Jebediah Crone is building.

01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:15.017
I don't know if it's the fact
I don't know the difference

01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:18.483
between an oak or an elm,
or a Rockefeller center Christmas tree,

01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:22.185
or that we walked into the forest
version of the Bermuda triangle.

01:04:22.984 --> 01:04:25.244
Ok. Stop.

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:41.923
What is this?

01:05:02.607 --> 01:05:04.477
"I pledge my son, Charles Eaton."

01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:07.399
"I pledge penny Marie Goodwin,
my daughter."

01:05:07.529 --> 01:05:09.859
"I pledge my daughter, Lexi,
and my son, Jeremy."

01:05:12.367 --> 01:05:15.157
"I pledge Lance Luther, my son."

01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:22.964
Grady, the school fire.

01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:27.256
Crone talked of sacrifice in that
sermon. This town pledged their kids.

01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:31.545
- This is awful.
- Jules, Jules...

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.350
"I pledge Amanda Howard, my daughter."

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:40.351
No. No!

01:05:40.478 --> 01:05:42.648
Jules, what can I do?

01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:28.112
What is this?

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:30.364
His collection.

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:45.211
Grady, look at this.

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:58.176
Look at all these rooms.

01:07:06.773 --> 01:07:08.613
Look at this.

01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:56.236
- Julia...
- Her room is out here somewhere.

01:07:58.700 --> 01:07:59.740
Argh!

01:07:59.867 --> 01:08:04.077
- Grady, behind you!
- Drop the weapon! Drop it!

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:05.785
The trigger...

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:07.915
Go! Go!

01:08:08.042 --> 01:08:09.962
What is this? No!

01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:13.755
- Grady!
- That! That! What the fuck was that?

01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:15.421
Let's go! Let's go!

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:29.857
Where's your boyfriend?

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:34.069
- Where is he?!
- Right behind you, asshole.

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:38.236
' - Grady!

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:45.792
Grady!

01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:55.761
Tell me what the fuck is going on
in new English.

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:58.682
- If I tell you, he kills me.
- If you don't, I will.

01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:01.505
Fuck!

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:05.219
- Hey. Here. Put these on for me.
- You fucking kidding me?!

01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:07.770
Shut up! Put 'em on!
Put 'em on right now!

01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:09.734
- Julia, get in the car.
- What?

01:09:09.854 --> 01:09:11.814
Get in the car! Put 'em on!

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:21.568
So tell me,
what the fuck is going on here?

01:09:21.698 --> 01:09:23.578
And I don't believe in ghosts.

01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:26.331
I gave you every opportunity to leave,

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:28.794
and you had to kick over
the goddamn hornet's nest.

01:09:28.915 --> 01:09:32.075
- Fuck you. Book us.
- Afraid that option's off the table.

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:36.127
Just do what he says, ok?
Just do what he says.

01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:38.545
Get out. Out.

01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:43.511
- Get the fuck off me!
- No, no, no, no!

01:09:43.638 --> 01:09:48.138
I stayed away from those woods half of
my goddamn life like a frickin' plague.

01:09:49.769 --> 01:09:52.769
Kids burning alive in a school building.
Tell me what happens next.

01:09:52.897 --> 01:09:57.147
What happens next? You have no idea
what this town was promised,

01:09:57.276 --> 01:09:58.686
or why we did what we did.

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.910
I came all the way out here to die.
Just talk!

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:04.990
- Get down on your knees.
- It wasn't an electrical fire, was it?

01:10:05.118 --> 01:10:08.248
You sacrificed your kids to him?
And for what?

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:11.291
The miracle of new English?
Show me the miracle of new English.

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:14.126
Show me the miracle of Jebediah Crone,
you stupid man.

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:18.629
The ground needed to be consecrated.

01:10:19.507 --> 01:10:21.797
The foundations need to be laid.

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:26.305
It started with a tragedy,
and it's gonna end with one. You...

01:10:26.431 --> 01:10:28.471
- No, no...
- You and your sister are leaving.

01:10:28.599 --> 01:10:32.769
It symbolized the one thing
that he was trying to remove: Hope.

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:34.515
Please don't do this! Please!

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:37.857
No, I'm gonna spare you both
from a very unfortunate life there.

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:40.991
' <i>'</i> No!

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:43.702
No, no, really.
I'm doing you a great kindness here.

01:10:43.823 --> 01:10:47.703
I don't expect you to understand,
but this is probably the last good deed

01:10:47.827 --> 01:10:50.247
I'm gonna do with my wretched life.
Believe me,

01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:54.871
the alternative they got planned for you
out in the forest is much, much worse.

01:10:56.085 --> 01:11:00.255
Julia Howard, this town
has awaited your return

01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:02.721
like lambs to the slaughter.

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:06.006
The two that got away.

01:11:06.137 --> 01:11:08.307
The only blood in new English
that survived.

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:12.771
Well, I'm gonna give you an out
that I couldn't give your sister.

01:11:12.894 --> 01:11:15.904
You just consider this bullet
to be the savior

01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:18.862
of what's waiting for you out there
in that forest.

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:23.953
Because you can't build
a room out of water.

01:11:26.073 --> 01:11:29.243
- I wish you a peaceful, always forward.
- No.

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:41.207
- No!
- Julia!

01:11:41.339 --> 01:11:43.049
Grady! No!

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:52.426
This way...

01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:25.416
Grady?

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:35.095
This way...

01:14:23.918 --> 01:14:26.088
Welcome, my dear.

01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:31.875
Please, allow me to offer you a deal.

01:14:32.009 --> 01:14:34.719
A compact, let's say.

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:36.715
One time only.

01:14:36.847 --> 01:14:41.307
You can walk away.
Tell your story to the whole world.

01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:45.685
Oh, what a captivating story
it would be. What a scoop.

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:50.282
Plucky writer exposes
some supernatural malefactor

01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:53.073
who makes a collection of ghosts,

01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:57.697
who opens a portal
to some fearful netherworld

01:14:58.619 --> 01:15:02.619
that exploits the denizens of a town

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:06.038
that sacrifices their children.

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:09.378
Front pager, for sure, but...

01:15:10.631 --> 01:15:13.051
...one without an ending.

01:15:13.551 --> 01:15:18.051
Or you may enter my house
upon your own free will.

01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:24.189
See your loved ones once again.
Be united.

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:28.190
But that choice is entirely up to you.

01:15:28.315 --> 01:15:31.605
- The video of Amanda?
- Taken in this very house.

01:15:31.736 --> 01:15:34.356
They await you inside.

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:38.284
- What did you do with Grady?
- He's alive.

01:15:38.409 --> 01:15:40.869
But that is neither here nor there.

01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:43.455
Decide, please.

01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:48.207
Forward... or reverse?

01:15:49.295 --> 01:15:51.955
Your sister awaits a reunion.

01:15:56.343 --> 01:15:59.473
As they say in the south: "Come on in."

01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:07.725
Forgive the disorder.

01:16:10.066 --> 01:16:11.976
They're unaccustomed to guests.

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:26.327
Daddy dearest... did everything he could
to save his daughters.

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:29.591
Only to have them to return to me.

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:33.300
There was a time I thought
you burned with the rest.

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:34.842
Clever that one.

01:16:34.965 --> 01:16:38.425
Years I spent wondering
where I went wrong.

01:16:38.552 --> 01:16:41.142
Never realizing the two that escaped.

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:42.853
What do you want?

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:47.137
Merely for you to listen.

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:49.689
I'm a man of words after all.
Tongue tipped in silver.

01:16:51.107 --> 01:16:53.937
And I do not enjoy being misunderstood.

01:16:54.068 --> 01:16:56.528
When we first spoke,
I told you about the fire.

01:16:56.654 --> 01:16:58.914
I gather you figured out
how I got there.

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:04.240
You killed innocent children,
and you corrupt an entire town. Why?

01:17:05.704 --> 01:17:08.964
I was a swindler swindled, miss Talben.

01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:11.633
That's a quote. You can quote me.

01:17:11.752 --> 01:17:16.252
One curries no favor with the devil.
It all truly is just flames.

01:17:16.674 --> 01:17:19.134
Divine irony.

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:23.180
But like Christ,
the great deceiver, I ascended.

01:17:25.057 --> 01:17:28.637
You live amongst the shadows
of the past

01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:33.269
with your typewriter
and snappy repartee.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.360
You carry your dearly departed around

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:39.864
like... atlas bore the weight
of the world.

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:44.986
I have seen what awaits on the other
side, and I have become proactive.

01:17:45.119 --> 01:17:49.539
You have hopes and dreams.

01:17:50.082 --> 01:17:52.752
Turn around. Walk away.

01:17:54.795 --> 01:17:56.665
Bother us no more.

01:17:58.382 --> 01:18:01.512
You killed my family. You poisoned them.

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:06.602
Where did you put him? Where is he?!

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:11.480
Would you like to see
my collection?

01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:15.654
Death and re-death
for the rest of all eternity.

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:20.087
Why?

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:23.300
I'm just connecting the dots.

01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:27.795
To combine these tragedies,
and create a discordancy.

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:29.930
A crack within cracks.

01:19:30.057 --> 01:19:34.387
I'm a collector, miss Talben,
and this house is my collection.

01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:39.149
Small pieces combined
to form a greater whole.

01:19:40.192 --> 01:19:43.992
Each death collected,
one step closer to breaking the wall

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:47.413
between this world and after.

01:19:49.243 --> 01:19:51.083
Goodbye, miss Talben.

01:19:51.912 --> 01:19:53.512
I hope you find what you're looking for.

01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:17.147
<i>This way...</i>

01:20:41.754 --> 01:20:43.344
<i>Charlie!</i>

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:45.970
Charlie!

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:48.682
<i>Charlie!</i>

01:20:48.802 --> 01:20:51.682
Charlie? Amanda?

01:21:08.489 --> 01:21:10.659
Amanda? Charlie?

01:21:10.783 --> 01:21:12.703
<i>Please help us!</i>

01:21:25.255 --> 01:21:27.165
Julia!

01:21:32.763 --> 01:21:34.063
Julia!

01:21:41.688 --> 01:21:44.018
Julia!

01:21:47.194 --> 01:21:49.114
<i>This way...</i>

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:05.460
Charlie?

01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:12.257
Julia!

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:27.992
Charlie?

01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:35.326
Julia!

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:37.870
Where the fuck is she?

01:22:37.995 --> 01:22:41.825
Before you enter,
of your own free will, dare I say,

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:45.787
let me offer you a comeback, a bargain.

01:22:45.919 --> 01:22:47.919
- No strings.
- What?

01:22:48.046 --> 01:22:49.916
You may walk away, right now,

01:22:50.048 --> 01:22:53.968
as you have suggested yourself,
so many times before.

01:22:54.094 --> 01:22:57.894
Live your life fully and freely.

01:22:58.015 --> 01:23:01.385
Or you can continue to follow the woman
who has brought you nothing...

01:23:01.518 --> 01:23:04.308
- Shut the fuck up.
- ...But grief.

01:23:04.438 --> 01:23:06.898
Hasn't she brought you
enough pain already?

01:23:08.025 --> 01:23:12.525
It would be a tragedy
to go one step further, detective.

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:15.074
Learn from your past mistakes.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.830
The future is that way, son.

01:23:19.161 --> 01:23:21.871
There's nothing in this house,
but the past.

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:57.818
Oh, my god.

01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:18.300
Hey! Hey, you!

01:24:34.987 --> 01:24:36.987
Oh, my god!

01:24:38.031 --> 01:24:39.121
Help!

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:43.292
No! No!

01:24:43.412 --> 01:24:45.412
No! No; “q!

01:24:45.539 --> 01:24:47.459
No, no, no, no! No!

01:24:49.626 --> 01:24:51.706
No!

01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:05.349
No!

01:25:17.988 --> 01:25:20.658
Grady!

01:25:48.769 --> 01:25:50.269
Fuck!

01:25:57.986 --> 01:26:00.406
Julia!

01:26:50.664 --> 01:26:54.634
<i>Mommy! Help me, mommy! Help me!</i>

01:26:57.087 --> 01:26:59.667
<i>Mommy, help me! Help me!</i>

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:11.230
<i>Mommy, help me!</i>

01:27:16.565 --> 01:27:19.185
Guys.

01:27:20.402 --> 01:27:24.412
Charlie? Charlie?

01:27:28.994 --> 01:27:31.964
Charlie? I'm here, Charlie.

01:27:39.838 --> 01:27:42.048
<i>This way...</i>

01:27:44.009 --> 01:27:48.259
- <i>Help!
- This way...</i>

01:27:53.393 --> 01:27:56.693
No, no.

01:28:07.616 --> 01:28:09.366
Ahhh...

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:18.538
<i>This way...</i>

01:28:19.085 --> 01:28:20.995
<i>This way...</i>

01:28:23.215 --> 01:28:25.625
<i>This way...</i>

01:28:27.344 --> 01:28:29.854
Charlie.

01:28:35.393 --> 01:28:37.653
No!

01:28:38.688 --> 01:28:40.268
No...

01:28:41.983 --> 01:28:45.743
- <i>Charlie?
- Charlie? Charlie?</i>

01:29:11.888 --> 01:29:14.598
Julia!

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:19.062
Julia!

01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:23.569
Julia, we've gotta go! Come on!

01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:26.490
Julia!

01:29:27.946 --> 01:29:30.696
Julia! Julia!

01:29:31.616 --> 01:29:33.326
Julia!

01:29:36.246 --> 01:29:37.616
Grady, no!

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:44.710
Grady! What do I do?

01:29:45.171 --> 01:29:47.921
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:29:54.139 --> 01:29:57.269
No, this isn't happening.

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:01.810
Touching, really.

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.690
Poor miss Julia Talben.

01:30:04.816 --> 01:30:08.396
One so easily played.

01:30:09.195 --> 01:30:12.905
Julia Talben,
all ambition with nothing to lose,

01:30:13.033 --> 01:30:16.833
perfectly inclined
to be my willing guest.

01:30:16.953 --> 01:30:21.453
This house of a thousand tragedies
required only a single tragedy

01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:23.880
all its own to become complete.

01:30:24.002 --> 01:30:26.052
- Julia Talben...
- Grady.

01:30:26.171 --> 01:30:27.511
...murderess.

01:30:27.631 --> 01:30:30.221
Killed the man she loved.

01:30:30.342 --> 01:30:32.592
The only one in this world

01:30:32.719 --> 01:30:37.219
capable of loving her in return
just for who she is.

01:30:37.891 --> 01:30:42.391
I gave him every chance to walk away,
as I did you.

01:30:44.856 --> 01:30:47.436
L would never turn my back on my family.

01:30:48.026 --> 01:30:49.856
Nor me, mine.

01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:00.750
You did all of this for them.

01:31:00.872 --> 01:31:02.832
They were the first.

01:31:03.416 --> 01:31:05.536
The anchor to my abattoir.

01:31:07.837 --> 01:31:09.837
Your wife and daughter?

01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:12.380
Still in the flames.

01:31:14.386 --> 01:31:17.346
Paid the price for my sins.

01:31:17.472 --> 01:31:20.852
Burned because of my indiscretions.

01:31:21.601 --> 01:31:26.101
Sentenced to an eternity of suffering,
forever and ever indeed.

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:32.649
You see, you and I are not so different,
miss Talben.

01:31:33.571 --> 01:31:37.031
You would brave a hell
for your loved ones.

01:31:37.158 --> 01:31:40.328
I would construct one for mine.

01:31:41.579 --> 01:31:44.619
And you are my final tragedy.

01:31:44.749 --> 01:31:47.209
The capstone to my foundation.

01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:49.795
Your sacrifice is what unlocks it all.

01:31:49.921 --> 01:31:53.261
You were pledged at birth,
and belong to this house.

01:31:53.383 --> 01:31:57.353
The final drop of blood
born from new English.

01:31:58.054 --> 01:32:01.604
My final stray come home at last.

01:32:05.311 --> 01:32:08.481
What did he have to do with your plan?
Why him?

01:32:08.606 --> 01:32:11.396
His blood is on your hands.

01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:16.026
The only family you have
is now at home with me.

01:32:16.239 --> 01:32:18.319
Think on it. Ponder it.

01:32:18.450 --> 01:32:22.910
Then spend the rest of your short life
regretting it.

01:32:28.334 --> 01:32:30.174
This is not real.

01:32:30.295 --> 01:32:34.465
You are just a nightmare.
This is just a nightmare.

01:32:34.591 --> 01:32:37.801
You're not real. You're not.

01:32:41.473 --> 01:32:45.733
It's too late for that brand
of histrionic denial.

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:10.330
I pledge my daughter, Julia Howard.

01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:21.390
I'd love to stay,
and delve in this longer, ms Talben,

01:33:21.513 --> 01:33:26.013
but I cannot permit my family
to suffer one moment longer.

01:33:31.064 --> 01:33:32.364
Go.

01:33:37.821 --> 01:33:39.991
They're waiting for you.

01:33:44.494 --> 01:33:45.584
Go.

01:33:49.124 --> 01:33:51.384
Adieu, ms Talben.

01:34:00.677 --> 01:34:03.007
<i>Every house is haunted.</i>

01:34:03.138 --> 01:34:05.558
<i>Every man a ghost.</i>

01:34:05.723 --> 01:34:08.233
<i>Downstairs are very best.</i>

01:34:08.351 --> 01:34:11.151
<i>Upstairs are worst.</i>

01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:14.612
<i>We are often enough born in our homes,</i>

01:34:14.732 --> 01:34:17.032
<i>and in the end we die,</i>

01:34:17.152 --> 01:34:21.652
<i>and in between we live,
if we are lucky.</i>

01:34:22.991 --> 01:34:27.001
<i>It is said that one
can never go home again.</i>

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:31.620
<i>But I wonder, do we ever truly leave?</i>
