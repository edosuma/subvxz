00:04.868 --> 00:07.534
Aaron, where's Joey?

00:07.601 --> 00:08.734
Taking a leak.

00:08.801 --> 00:10.334
Buddy system.

00:10.400 --> 00:11.434
Come on.

00:11.501 --> 00:12.701
Which way did he go?

00:12.767 --> 00:14.234
I don't know. Geez.

00:14.300 --> 00:16.634
Joey's gotta whiz, like,
every ten minutes and I...

00:32.500 --> 00:34.467
Trauma to the forehead.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.467
Eyes full of maggots and all you see

00:36.534 --> 00:38.367
is the boo-boo on the forehead.

00:38.434 --> 00:40.200
Hands bound in front of him.

00:40.267 --> 00:42.868
Definitely not execution style.

00:42.934 --> 00:44.534
What's the, uh, shiny stuff on the nose?

00:44.601 --> 00:46.634
Some kind of emollient.

00:46.701 --> 00:48.334
It's around his lips, too.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.100
You get anything out of the boy who found him?

00:50.167 --> 00:51.801
Only thing came out of the kid was vomit.

00:51.868 --> 00:54.534
That would explain the pervasive smell.

00:54.601 --> 00:56.934
Why am I here?Dead guy.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.767
Foul play.It's your main function.

00:58.834 --> 01:00.634
With... bones.

01:00.667 --> 01:02.767
This is very

01:02.834 --> 01:04.167
No, there's a bit of bone here.

01:04.233 --> 01:06.367
And there.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.467
And look at all the maggots.

01:07.534 --> 01:09.767
"Bones," I said, not "bugs."

01:09.834 --> 01:12.167
Lividity looks fixed.

01:12.234 --> 01:14.234
So, it's not a body dump--he was killed here.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.000
This is all flesh.

01:16.067 --> 01:18.000
Why'd you call me in on this?

01:18.067 --> 01:20.200
-Wasn't me.-It was me.-Why?

01:20.267 --> 01:22.300
Is it because you're trying to thi of excuses

01:22.367 --> 01:24.033
to put Booth and me together on cases?

01:24.100 --> 01:25.634
I wouldn't do that,Dr. Brennan.

01:25.701 --> 01:28.467
'Cause we worked things out 
and we're fine. Right?

01:28.534 --> 01:29.734
Yeah. Hundred percent.

01:29.801 --> 01:32.033
That's... That's not why I called you in.

01:32.100 --> 01:34.234
Then why?

01:34.300 --> 01:35.868
Feet are missing.
Because his feet are missing,

01:35.934 --> 01:41.300
which suggests bone trauma,
which immediately suggested you.

01:41.367 --> 01:42.534
Oh, look at that.

01:42.601 --> 01:44.367
Blood.

01:44.434 --> 01:47.334
Do you think that's from, uh...
the wound on the forehead?

01:47.400 --> 01:48.667
No. Too much.

01:48.734 --> 01:53.901
All right, looks like the blood trail stops here.

01:53.968 --> 01:55.667
You want the honor?

01:55.734 --> 01:57.934
The honor is all yours.

02:02.801 --> 02:05.868
I got a foot...

02:07.000 --> 02:08.100
Me, too.

02:08.167 --> 02:11.067
Find a third one,

02:12.801 --> 02:16.033
I estimate time of death 
and at or around four days.

02:16.100 --> 02:18.267
Hodgins took a look at the 
maggots and agrees.

02:18.334 --> 02:20.567
Trauma to the frontal bone 
would have been fatal.

02:20.634 --> 02:22.801
Yeah, and tissue damage 
indicates some kind of blade.

02:22.868 --> 02:23.934
So does bone damage.

02:25.567 --> 02:27.467
Dr. Brennan, you aren't being competitive

02:27.534 --> 02:29.634
between flesh and bone, are you?

02:29.701 --> 02:31.567
It's possible.

02:34.167 --> 02:35.767
Absence of pronounced ecchymosis

02:35.834 --> 02:37.601
on the wrists indicates the hands

02:37.667 --> 02:38.968
were bound post-mortem.

02:39.033 --> 02:40.267
Consistent with the feet.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.868
No hemorrhagic tissue.

02:41.934 --> 02:43.200
They were removed post-mortem.

02:43.267 --> 02:44.868
Was that competitive?

02:44.934 --> 02:47.801
No, I'm hearing a tone, but it 
could be my imagination.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.901
Angela's going to be hypnotized.

02:49.968 --> 02:51.133
Why?

02:51.200 --> 02:52.868
She's going deep into her subconscious

02:52.934 --> 02:54.400
to remember her husband's name

02:54.467 --> 02:57.467
so we can find him, divorce him, 
get married ourselves

02:57.534 --> 02:59.667
and live happily for all eternity.

02:59.734 --> 03:01.701
You won't live for eternity. 
I thought you had a name.

03:01.767 --> 03:02.734
A name for what?

03:02.801 --> 03:04.734
Angela's husband.Birimbau.

03:04.801 --> 03:07.133
But our private investigator 
says it's a nickname.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.400
Well, you can't get much off a nickname.

03:08.467 --> 03:10.567
Birimbau is, uh, "little flute."

03:10.634 --> 03:12.000
Brazilian.

03:13.868 --> 03:14.968
What?

03:16.634 --> 03:19.400
I'm suddenly filled with a sense of well-being.

03:19.501 --> 03:22.267
The jury is out on the efficacy and validity

03:22.334 --> 03:23.400
of recovered memories.- That's great.

03:23.467 --> 03:24.667
Speaking of names,

03:24.734 --> 03:26.300
I, uh, ran the vic's prints.

03:26.367 --> 03:27.367
I got a hit.

03:28.734 --> 03:30.033
The shiny substance you found

03:30.100 --> 03:31.367
on the victim's nose and mouth--

03:31.434 --> 03:32.634
it's sunscreen.

03:32.701 --> 03:35.701
Per the manufacturer,"it protects and maintains

03:35.767 --> 03:38.868
the natural color of coats, manes and tails."

03:38.934 --> 03:42.334
Coats, manes and tails. Oh, my.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.000
Formulated for horses.

03:44.067 --> 03:45.367
Any human applications?

03:45.434 --> 03:47.033
The manufacturer recommends <i>against</i>

03:47.100 --> 03:48.634
use on human skin.

03:48.701 --> 03:50.534
Guys, contents of the victim's stomach

03:50.601 --> 03:54.033
are corn, raw oats and dried molasses.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.968
-Horse food?-FYI.

03:56.033 --> 03:57.434
There's such a thing as too much fiber.

03:57.501 --> 03:59.467
All right, I can draw inferences

03:59.534 --> 04:01.000
from multiple equine implications.

04:01.067 --> 04:02.501
What?

04:02.567 --> 04:05.868
She's going along with the 
horsey theme.Incised wounds

04:05.934 --> 04:08.167
extending into the periosteum of the maxilla,

04:08.234 --> 04:10.667
between the molars and premolars.

04:11.734 --> 04:12.901
What?

04:12.968 --> 04:15.400
His teeth and jaw show evidence of a bit.

04:18.767 --> 04:20.132
His name is "Ed."

04:21.934 --> 04:23.033
Why is that funny?

04:23.100 --> 04:24.400
As in, "A horse is a horse..."

04:24.467 --> 04:26.167
Of course, of course.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.534
The famous Mr. Ed?

04:31.434 --> 04:34.267
Mr. Ed?!

05:03.701 --> 05:06.634
he was suppose in coorporate 
retreat in Orlando, Florida.

05:07.701 --> 05:08.801
He's in marketing.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.167
Are you able to identify

05:11.234 --> 05:13.267
your husband's body from that photograph?

05:14.334 --> 05:17.267
Yes, that's Ed.

05:17.334 --> 05:20.467
I don't understand...

05:20.534 --> 05:22.467
who could've done that.

05:22.534 --> 05:24.801
We found your husband's body

05:24.868 --> 05:27.801
just outside Harrisonburg, Virginia.

05:27.868 --> 05:29.801
Virginia?

05:29.868 --> 05:30.900
Did he, uh,

05:30.967 --> 05:34.401
mention any recent disagreements?

05:34.467 --> 05:37.234
Friends, co-workers,family members?

05:37.300 --> 05:38.567
No.

05:38.634 --> 05:39.933
Ed was one of "those guys."

05:40.000 --> 05:41.900
When we got married,we owned

05:41.967 --> 05:43.067
an apartment building.

05:43.134 --> 05:44.401
If a tenant couldn't afford the rent,

05:44.467 --> 05:45.667
Ed would cut him a break.

05:45.734 --> 05:46.900
That's how he was with everyone.

05:46.967 --> 05:48.000
Do you have a ranch?

05:48.067 --> 05:50.434
Own a racehorse,

05:50.501 --> 05:52.467
a pony ride,

05:52.534 --> 05:53.534
anything like that?

05:53.601 --> 05:54.601
No. Why?

05:54.667 --> 05:56.801
Did Ed ever go to the racetrack?

05:56.868 --> 05:58.801
Rodeos?

05:58.868 --> 06:01.033
I'm not sure Ed even ever saw a real horse

06:01.100 --> 06:02.701
up close and in person.

06:02.768 --> 06:03.868
Why?

06:03.933 --> 06:06.434
I don't have anything concrete,right now,

06:06.501 --> 06:08.501
but when I do I'll let you know.

06:16.033 --> 06:17.267
Hey!

06:17.334 --> 06:19.067
Hay is for horses.

06:19.134 --> 06:21.200
Hey, that's funny, Bones.

06:21.267 --> 06:23.033
I found it on this Web site about horses.

06:23.100 --> 06:24.534
Yeah?Where do horses

06:24.601 --> 06:26.534
stay in a hotel?

06:26.601 --> 06:27.701
Bridle suite.

06:27.768 --> 06:28.868
That's correct.

06:29.967 --> 06:31.534
So, did you find out anything useful?

06:31.601 --> 06:34.200
The hooves of champion thoroughbreds

06:34.267 --> 06:36.200
are buried separately from their corpses.

06:36.267 --> 06:37.868
The hooves represent "power"

06:37.933 --> 06:39.534
and are given their own resting spot.

06:39.601 --> 06:42.067
Our victim's feet were separated from his body.

06:42.134 --> 06:45.067
The victim's wife said he was at a corporate retreat.

06:45.134 --> 06:47.734
And his boss said he took time off to spend with the family.

06:47.801 --> 06:48.834
He lied.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.300
Yeah, they could all be lying.

06:50.367 --> 06:53.234
How did you know the answer to the bridle suite joke?

06:53.334 --> 06:54.834
I have a five year old son.

07:01.967 --> 07:04.401
Hey, have you seen Brennan?

07:04.467 --> 07:06.067
You just missed her.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.401
Booth tracked down the victim's last credit card purchase

07:08.467 --> 07:10.401
to a country inn in Virginia.

07:10.467 --> 07:12.401
Why? Do you need her?

07:12.467 --> 07:15.067
No, I was sort of hoping that she needed me.

07:15.134 --> 07:17.167
Well, I admire your work ethic

07:17.234 --> 07:18.834
but she didn't say anything to me.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.100
What about you?

07:20.167 --> 07:21.367
You need anything?

07:21.434 --> 07:23.367
I am weighing human organs.

07:23.434 --> 07:24.868
Not really your thing.

07:24.933 --> 07:25.900
Right.

07:25.967 --> 07:26.933
Okay.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.434
Are you passing the time

07:28.501 --> 07:29.667
until you're hypnotized?

07:29.734 --> 07:30.701
Did Hodgins

07:30.768 --> 07:32.567
tell everybody?Oh, he's excited.

07:32.634 --> 07:33.734
We all are.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.234
Delving into the subconscious

07:35.300 --> 07:37.234
to find the name of the mystery husband?

07:37.300 --> 07:39.234
Very romantic.

07:39.300 --> 07:41.067
Yeah, well, it won't be so romantic

07:41.134 --> 07:42.734
when I divorce him.Romantic

07:42.801 --> 07:44.768
for you and Hodgins when you can finally get married.

07:44.834 --> 07:45.801
You nervous?

07:45.868 --> 07:47.033
No.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.434
No, I'm annoyed.

07:48.501 --> 07:50.234
I know about this hypnotism thing.

07:50.300 --> 07:51.967
I was a magician's assistant

07:52.033 --> 07:55.701
at a little gypsy carnival in Brazil.

07:55.768 --> 07:57.701
Ugh, Mysteria was really cute

07:57.768 --> 07:59.701
and I was younger then and...

07:59.768 --> 08:02.534
the whole being sawed in half thing was actually kind of hot.

08:02.601 --> 08:04.434
We were talking about hypnotism.

08:04.501 --> 08:05.634
Right.

08:05.701 --> 08:07.434
Well, this guy could

08:07.501 --> 08:08.501
rub an alligator's stomach

08:08.567 --> 08:10.167
so I could stick my head inside

08:10.234 --> 08:12.167
its mouth, but every time he hypnotized people,

08:12.234 --> 08:14.634
it was always a scam.

08:14.701 --> 08:17.634
Angela, therapeutic hypnosis is a proven technique.

08:17.701 --> 08:19.601
Electroencephalography shows

08:19.667 --> 08:21.768
an increase in activity in the the cerebral cortex

08:21.834 --> 08:23.567
which opens the subconscious.

08:23.634 --> 08:24.567
Really?

08:24.634 --> 08:25.567
Yeah, it alters

08:25.634 --> 08:27.134
the alpha and the theta waves.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.567
Read the Stanford University study.

08:28.634 --> 08:29.567
It's not a party trick.

08:29.634 --> 08:30.567
You read that?

08:30.634 --> 08:32.900
And I've been hypnotized myself.

08:34.134 --> 08:35.234
Why?

08:35.299 --> 08:36.567
I was in Vegas.

08:36.634 --> 08:39.768
I got called up on stage,

08:39.833 --> 08:42.267
and apparently,I clucked like a chicken

08:42.333 --> 08:44.134
in front of 3,000 people, but I have

08:44.200 --> 08:45.967
absolutely no memory of it.

08:46.033 --> 08:48.467
Was this little episode in the Stanford study?

08:48.534 --> 08:49.634
No, it should have been.

08:49.701 --> 08:50.933
For the next three days,

08:51.000 --> 08:52.667
every time someone said "coffee," I'd cluck.

08:52.734 --> 08:53.768
Awkward.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.933
Okay, why am I not feeling better about this?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.134
Trust me.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.667
No crazier than you drinking kava

08:58.734 --> 09:00.134
and marrying a giant in Fiji.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.300
And Hodgins seems to be pretty cool with that, so...

09:02.367 --> 09:04.134
if he wants you to try hypnosis

09:04.200 --> 09:06.534
I'd say get drowsy.

09:06.601 --> 09:08.534
I guess you're right.

09:08.601 --> 09:10.167
I've done crazier stuff than this.

09:10.234 --> 09:11.234
Yeah.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.367
What can happen, right?

09:12.434 --> 09:13.734
There you go.

09:18.434 --> 09:20.501
Coffee?

09:21.300 --> 09:22.467
Kidding.

09:22.534 --> 09:24.768
It's been two years.

09:32.200 --> 09:35.134
So you say you're with the FBI.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.801
That is the third time he's shown you his I.D.

09:40.134 --> 09:41.567
Why would I know this man?

09:41.634 --> 09:43.967
Because we have his credit card history and you're part of it.

09:44.033 --> 09:45.667
Sir, why are you being so difficult?

09:45.734 --> 09:47.667
Not difficult.

09:47.734 --> 09:49.567
Discreet.

09:49.634 --> 09:51.367
What do you do? Run a service

09:51.434 --> 09:52.534
for cheating husbands?

09:52.601 --> 09:53.567
Call in the SWAT team.

09:53.634 --> 09:54.567
Theyre anything but discreet.

09:54.634 --> 09:58.933
O-Okay, okay, that's Mr. Ed.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.534
A horse is a horse,

10:00.201 --> 10:01.767
of course,of course?

10:01.934 --> 10:03.301
That's the general idea, yes.

10:05.567 --> 10:07.734
Come with me, please.

10:10.867 --> 10:12.467
The Ambassadora is a
place where people come

10:12.534 --> 10:15.134
to indulge in
pony-play fantasy,

10:15.200 --> 10:16.801
24 hours a day,

10:16.867 --> 10:18.400
without fear
of judgment.

10:18.467 --> 10:21.068
Mr. Ed is a pony.

10:21.134 --> 10:23.101
Is this some kind of sex thing?

10:23.168 --> 10:24.567
How'd you get there so quickly?

10:24.634 --> 10:26.400
The man said "fantasy."
I just made the leap.

10:26.467 --> 10:28.068
Ed took off a couple
of days ago,

10:28.134 --> 10:30.600
which was odd,
since he pre-paid.

10:30.667 --> 10:31.767
Pre-paid for what?

10:31.834 --> 10:33.434
Oh, we're, uh,

10:33.500 --> 10:35.934
we're in the middle of what
you might call our convention.

10:36.001 --> 10:38.001
So, unless this is really
important,i'd rather not disturb my guests

10:40.434 --> 10:43.367
Well, two miles from here,
in the woods,

10:43.434 --> 10:46.634
Mr. Ed was found dead.

10:53.267 --> 10:55.233
Woe? What's going on here?

10:55.333 --> 10:56.901
BRENNAN:
It's a fetish.

10:56.967 --> 10:58.500
BOOTH:
Uh, so the idea
here is that

10:58.567 --> 10:59.734
one of them
is the horse

10:59.801 --> 11:01.101
and the other one
is the rider?

11:01.168 --> 11:02.101
Basically.

11:02.168 --> 11:03.434
Well, this isn't
about the horses.

11:03.500 --> 11:04.934
It's about a dominant

11:05.001 --> 11:06.934
versus submissive
balance of power,

11:07.001 --> 11:09.233
a variation on
sadomasochism.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.267
Those people are eating
from troughs.

11:11.333 --> 11:14.367
Do you think
that's sexy?

11:14.434 --> 11:16.367
Fetishism is a way
of indulging

11:16.434 --> 11:18.134
in sexual activity
without actually

11:18.200 --> 11:20.101
engaging emotionally
with the other person

11:20.168 --> 11:21.600
as a fully formed
human being.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.101
Okay, sex is all
about engaging.

11:24.168 --> 11:26.634
You don't want to engage,
you just stay home and...

11:26.701 --> 11:27.667
you know.

11:27.734 --> 11:29.001
They have
masturbation fetishes,

11:29.068 --> 11:31.168
often involving women's
shoes or undergarments.

11:31.233 --> 11:33.068
Uh, can we just talk
to Mr. Ed's mistress,

11:33.134 --> 11:34.267
dominatrix, whatever.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.434
I'm going to have to talk
to a few people

11:36.500 --> 11:37.967
and ask permission
to "out" them.

11:38.034 --> 11:40.034
e three lawyers,
a half a dozen doctors...

11:40.101 --> 11:42.333
Excuse me, we need to
speak with Mr. Ed's groom?

11:42.400 --> 11:45.400
Whoever... rode him last?

11:45.467 --> 11:47.434
It's a great way to cut to
the chase there, Bones, okay?

11:47.500 --> 11:49.300
All right, FBI.

11:49.367 --> 11:51.001
And, sir, could you
turn your behind

11:51.068 --> 11:53.567
around so it's behind?

12:00.934 --> 12:05.200
My name in the world is
Anne Marie Ostenbach.

12:05.267 --> 12:06.934
Here, I'm Annie Oakley.

12:07.001 --> 12:09.434
Naturally.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.101
So Mr. Ed is dead?

12:11.168 --> 12:12.667
How well did you
actually know him?

12:12.734 --> 12:14.767
Obviously, she knew
him very well.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.767
Sexual fetishes
are all about role playing.

12:16.834 --> 12:18.867
She probably never knew
his real name.

12:18.934 --> 12:21.600
We met online
over a year ago.

12:21.667 --> 12:24.600
We were a match--
I mean, compatible in every way.

12:24.667 --> 12:26.834
You have no idea how hard it is
to find the perfect pony.

12:26.901 --> 12:29.168
BOOTH:
Don't look at me.

12:29.233 --> 12:31.734
Mr. Ed was easy
to handle, but he wasn't
mindlessly obedient.

12:31.801 --> 12:34.333
Okay.
And yes,

12:34.400 --> 12:36.233
we had sex, if that's
your next question.

12:36.300 --> 12:37.300
When did you
first meet

12:37.367 --> 12:39.134
in person so that you could,

12:39.200 --> 12:41.801
you know, um... ride him?

12:41.867 --> 12:43.500
Six months ago.

12:43.567 --> 12:45.367
I fell in love with him.

12:45.434 --> 12:46.701
Meaning, what,

12:46.767 --> 12:47.734
a little light whipping?

12:47.801 --> 12:49.068
When I say
"love," I don't

12:49.134 --> 12:51.567
mean romantically.

12:51.634 --> 12:54.233
I mean the way a young girl
feels about her first pony.

12:54.300 --> 12:57.233
Have you ever heard
of anything like

12:57.300 --> 12:58.801
one pony fighting another?

12:58.867 --> 13:01.034
No. No, pony play
is not like that.

13:01.101 --> 13:03.467
Mr. Ed's body was found
only a few miles from here.

13:03.534 --> 13:06.200
Evidence on the body
suggested an equine fetish.

13:06.267 --> 13:09.001
So you understand why we might
think that someone from your

13:09.068 --> 13:11.001
sex game community
killed him?

13:11.068 --> 13:13.333
You should talk to his wife.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.667
His wife?
Yes, she showed up here

13:14.734 --> 13:16.068
and the next morning,
Ed was gone.

13:16.134 --> 13:17.834
Oh, well, he didn't just run off

13:17.901 --> 13:19.534
and join a band
of wild mustangs now, did he?

13:19.600 --> 13:20.567
You know,

13:20.634 --> 13:21.934
I'm speaking to you willingly,

13:22.001 --> 13:23.734
without a lawyer present,

13:23.801 --> 13:26.333
you could at least pretend
to show me some respect.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.867
Yeah, I'll try.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.068
The night Ed took off,

13:30.134 --> 13:32.767
I was in the stables with him.

13:32.834 --> 13:35.834
I'd worked him hard that day
and was rubbing him down.

13:35.901 --> 13:37.934
Which is when she caught us.

13:38.001 --> 13:39.233
Did you know he was married?

13:39.300 --> 13:40.801
I didn't want to
marry the man,

13:40.867 --> 13:42.801
I just wanted to play
with the pony.

13:42.867 --> 13:44.701
How did he react
when he saw his wife?

13:44.767 --> 13:47.034
He never broke character.

13:47.101 --> 13:48.734
What?
He remained a pony.

13:48.801 --> 13:50.134
I finished
rubbing him down

13:50.200 --> 13:52.101
and I went to bed alone.

13:52.168 --> 13:54.068
The next morning at
breakfast, he was gone.

13:54.134 --> 13:55.767
I assumed he went
back to his wife.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.534
BOOTH:
Okay, I'd appreciate

13:57.600 --> 13:59.200
if you kept the fact
that Ed Milner was murdered

13:59.267 --> 14:00.634
to yourself.

14:04.134 --> 14:06.034
BOOTH:
 <i>What's worse?</i>

14:06.101 --> 14:07.434
Okay, finding out

14:07.500 --> 14:09.534
that your spouse
is having an affair

14:09.600 --> 14:12.667
or finding out that he has
a secret life as a pony?

14:12.734 --> 14:15.934
Pony fetishism has been
around since the Greeks.

14:16.001 --> 14:17.667
Had to have been
the wife, right?

14:17.734 --> 14:20.801
Aristotle extolled the joys
of being ridden like a horse.

14:20.867 --> 14:23.101
Aristotle also thought that
the purpose of the human heart

14:23.168 --> 14:24.267
was to solve math problems.

14:24.333 --> 14:26.467
I'm surprised you know that.

14:26.534 --> 14:28.701
Oh, it turns out I'm smarter
than a fifth grader.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.667
In Victorian England,
scantily clad women

14:32.734 --> 14:34.901
put on erotic shows
dressed as ponies.

14:34.967 --> 14:36.600
Just saying, wife sees
some woman in a harness

14:36.667 --> 14:39.300
rubbing her husband down
while he's nibbling on oats?

14:39.367 --> 14:40.400
That's harsh.

14:40.467 --> 14:41.934
In 16th century Turkey,

14:42.001 --> 14:43.734
the king kept stables
of pony girls

14:43.801 --> 14:45.467
and pony boys
for his pleasure.

14:45.534 --> 14:47.134
Okay, the king of Turkey
was a freak.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.767
Why are you being so judgmental?

14:48.834 --> 14:50.001
When you turn someone

14:50.068 --> 14:53.600
into an object of sexual pleasure, it's wrong.

14:53.667 --> 14:55.367
How do you know?
It says in the Bible.

14:55.434 --> 14:56.500
It does not.

14:56.567 --> 14:58.767
Then it got left out by mistake.
We are all

14:58.834 --> 15:00.400
hard-wired differently.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.500
If someone needs to shout

15:02.567 --> 15:03.934
"giddyup"
to heighten arousal,

15:04.001 --> 15:06.168
what's wrong with that?

15:06.233 --> 15:07.667
Maybe if Ed lived like a man,

15:07.734 --> 15:09.600
he wouldn't have died
like a horse.

15:09.667 --> 15:11.667
That's all.

15:13.901 --> 15:16.134
BRENNAN:
 <i>You knew your husband</i>
 <i>wasn't in Florida.</i>

15:16.200 --> 15:18.801
Yes, I lied.
Why?

15:18.867 --> 15:21.434
I was married to Ed
for nine years.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.834
We have kids.

15:22.901 --> 15:24.934
My first concern
was to make sure

15:25.001 --> 15:27.333
that they didn't find out
their father was a pervert.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.233
So his fetish was
a surprise to you?

15:29.300 --> 15:31.068
Try a complete shock.

15:31.134 --> 15:32.801
Why would Ed do that?

15:32.867 --> 15:34.801
We had a good sex life.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.734
More likely, there was a part
of your husband

15:36.801 --> 15:39.001
that could never have been
satisfied by love alone.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.500
Bones, that's one of those--

15:40.567 --> 15:43.333
we... how did
you track him down?

15:43.400 --> 15:45.333
What?
Well, I mean,
you didn't just,

15:45.400 --> 15:50.567
you know, wander into his,
uh, his stable, or paddock,

15:50.667 --> 15:52.168
No, I really did think

15:52.233 --> 15:54.434
he was in Orlando
on a business trip.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.267
I got a call.
From whom?

15:56.333 --> 15:58.068
A man.

15:58.134 --> 15:59.834
He said Ed was
with another woman

15:59.901 --> 16:02.300
and told me
where I could find them.

16:02.367 --> 16:04.267
He didn't mention
the pony stuff.

16:04.333 --> 16:06.567
Did you recognize his voice?
No.

16:06.634 --> 16:08.333
Anything distinctive at all?

16:08.400 --> 16:11.068
An accent.

16:11.134 --> 16:14.200
Um, Australian maybe, English.

16:14.267 --> 16:18.534
So, you walked in
on Ed and his, um...

16:18.600 --> 16:19.834
Rider.

16:19.901 --> 16:20.934
Rider.

16:21.001 --> 16:22.901
Is that what they call it?

16:22.967 --> 16:25.434
What happened next?

16:25.500 --> 16:27.434
I got the hell out of there.
I drove home.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.134
Did you hear from him again?

16:29.200 --> 16:31.867
No, I engaged
a divorce attorney right away,

16:31.934 --> 16:34.467
who said all communications
should go through her.

16:34.534 --> 16:36.701
Did anyone see you
come home that night?

16:36.767 --> 16:38.400
Why is that important?

16:38.467 --> 16:41.734
I think you know <i>why</i>
that's important, Mrs. Milner.

16:41.801 --> 16:45.701
Agent Booth,
if I had killed my husband,

16:45.767 --> 16:48.367
then I wouldn't need
a divorce lawyer, would I?

16:48.501 --> 16:52.034
No, but u would need an alibi

16:54.767 --> 16:56.367
So you don't think
she did it, hmm?

16:57.434 --> 16:59.634
- No.
- You want to put that down?

16:59.701 --> 17:01.367
Why, because of the whole
lawyer/alibi thing?

17:01.434 --> 17:03.467
No, because of the
feet cut off thing.

17:03.534 --> 17:04.867
It was ritualistic.

17:04.934 --> 17:06.467
The killer knew about horses.

17:06.534 --> 17:09.967
Or maybe she started
cutting him into little bits

17:10.034 --> 17:11.701
to scatter across
the countryside

17:11.767 --> 17:14.134
and it was too much
work for it,or maybe

17:14.200 --> 17:15.367
it made her sick.

17:15.434 --> 17:16.800
Or he wouldn't fit
in the trunk.

17:16.867 --> 17:18.834
Booth, we are immersed
in a culture here.

17:18.901 --> 17:20.200
Pony play is a culture?

17:20.267 --> 17:21.867
Anthropologically speaking.

17:21.934 --> 17:23.567
And not just because
of the feet.

17:23.634 --> 17:26.834
Ed's hands were tied together.
Historically rangers bound

17:26.901 --> 17:30.300
the front two legs of horses
to prevent tm from straying.

17:30.367 --> 17:32.967
Not to mention all the
other equine attributes

17:33.034 --> 17:34.134
associated with this case.

17:34.200 --> 17:35.801
Yes, this is a culture

17:35.867 --> 17:38.567
and we need to
investigate accordingly.

17:38.634 --> 17:39.901
Do you still think she did it?

17:39.967 --> 17:41.001
No, not now.

17:42.068 --> 17:43.767
We need to find
the mystery caller.

17:43.834 --> 17:46.200
If he had a reason
to contact Ed's wife,

17:46.267 --> 17:49.101
he had a motive
to murder him.

17:49.168 --> 17:51.434
Right, so, what,
back to the Ambassadora?

17:51.500 --> 17:54.034
Giddyup.
Yeah, um...

17:54.101 --> 17:55.701
(clicks tongue)
Don't, don't say that.

17:58.701 --> 18:00.600
There were radiate fracture ranging out of the wound

18:00.600 --> 18:03.434
which suggest the tip of the blade was blunt.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.168
I'm trying to determine
the type of weapon.

18:06.233 --> 18:08.034
Fill the negative space
with microsol,

18:08.101 --> 18:10.300
thus determining the approximate
shape of the blade's tip.

18:10.367 --> 18:12.934
Yes.
Hmm.

18:13.001 --> 18:16.467
You know, this guy got his rocks off 
pretending to be a horse.

18:16.534 --> 18:19.434
Yes.
I've never tried that.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.500
I pretended to be a
horse a lot as a child,

18:21.567 --> 18:22.801
but there was no
sexual component.

18:22.867 --> 18:24.534
What melon is in season?

18:24.600 --> 18:26.567
Why?

18:26.634 --> 18:28.434
Once I've I.D.'d a
possible murder weapon,

18:28.500 --> 18:30.901
we'll want to compare an
exemplar to the entry wound.

18:30.967 --> 18:33.300
Cantaloupe.

18:40.934 --> 18:43.233
Okay, what is this,
a sicko rodeo?

18:43.300 --> 18:45.767
Stylized movements,
posturing

18:45.834 --> 18:47.934
as a kind of sexual signal.

18:48.001 --> 18:49.901
Who are these people?
In real life,

18:49.967 --> 18:51.134
In real life, they tend to be very orthodox.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.500
You heard what Lucky said,

18:52.567 --> 18:55.434
they're lawyers,
judges, FBI guys.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.267
Oh, this is not normal.

18:58.333 --> 18:59.734
It's, uh...
It's what, Booth?

19:00.967 --> 19:02.333
You're not interested in, uh...?

19:02.400 --> 19:03.967
Pony play?

19:04.034 --> 19:05.434
No, but I'm the first

19:05.500 --> 19:07.467
to admit that
in sexual situations,

19:07.534 --> 19:09.600
I have indulged
in role playing.

19:09.667 --> 19:14.034
Hey, you know what, it's
getting a little warm out here.

19:14.101 --> 19:15.801
Brennan:We're wondering if any

19:15.867 --> 19:18.767
of the riders or ponies
has an accent.

19:18.834 --> 19:19.767
Uh, Thor.

19:19.834 --> 19:21.101
WOMAN:
That's good.

19:21.168 --> 19:22.134
You're doing good.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.634
LUCKY:
He grew up in England.

19:23.701 --> 19:25.667
BRENNAN:
With Annie Oakley?
Yeah, that's right.

19:25.734 --> 19:27.701
You know, I'm going to need
Thor's actual, normal,

19:27.767 --> 19:29.200
human name.
Calvin Johnson.

19:29.267 --> 19:30.734
Calvin Johnson.
That's great, come on.

19:30.801 --> 19:32.367
Thanks.

19:32.434 --> 19:33.667
WOMAN:
Come on! Higher!

19:33.734 --> 19:36.734
We all indulge in role playing
in sexual situations.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.168
Oh, not me.

19:38.233 --> 19:39.500
Completely normal here.

19:39.567 --> 19:42.667
Booth, anytime you look
at a woman and make the judgment

19:42.734 --> 19:44.500
that she's beautiful,
you're objectifying her.

19:44.567 --> 19:47.200
And anytime I put on lipstick
and nice clothes,

19:47.267 --> 19:49.534
I'm objectifying myself.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.300
It's more subtle than
what these people are doing,

19:52.367 --> 19:54.333
but otherwise,
it's the same dynamic.

19:54.400 --> 19:57.168
You wearing lipstick, Bones,
it's not like this.

19:57.233 --> 19:59.801
Uh, Calvin Johnson?
(neighs)

19:59.867 --> 20:01.834
Calvin Johnson.
(claps)

20:01.901 --> 20:04.634
He's wearing a bit gag.

20:04.701 --> 20:06.534
Could I help you
take that off?

20:06.600 --> 20:08.034
No, not until I say so.

20:08.101 --> 20:09.534
Well, we either
talk to him here

20:09.600 --> 20:11.101
or we all go downtown

20:11.168 --> 20:13.101
and he misses a whole day
of horsing around.

20:13.168 --> 20:16.001
How do you release him from his
pony personae? Is it a word?

20:16.068 --> 20:17.934
A motion?

20:18.001 --> 20:19.101
Oh, just tap him
on the forehead.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.200
So what's up, then?

20:00.567 --> 20:02.534
Calvin Johnson.
(claps)

20:02.601 --> 20:05.334
He's wearing a bit gag.

20:05.401 --> 20:07.234
Could I help you
take that off?

20:07.300 --> 20:08.734
No, not until I say so.

20:08.801 --> 20:10.234
Well, we either
talk to him here

20:10.300 --> 20:11.801
or we all go downtown

20:11.868 --> 20:13.801
and he misses a whole day
of horsing around.

20:13.868 --> 20:16.701
How do you release him from his
pony personae? Is it a word?

20:16.768 --> 20:18.634
A motion?

20:18.701 --> 20:19.801
Oh, just tap him
on the forehead.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.900
So what's up, then?

20:27.967 --> 20:28.933
Hardly even knew Ed.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.167
Never even spoke to the guy.

20:30.234 --> 20:31.734
Oh, then why'd you
call his wife?

20:31.801 --> 20:33.801
Well, I'm fairly certain
you can't prove that was me.

20:33.868 --> 20:35.000
She recorded the call.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.367
We can do voice analysis.

20:36.434 --> 20:37.933
you know what,
and if you lie,

20:38.000 --> 20:39.334
we'll charge you
with obstruction of justice.

20:39.401 --> 20:42.334
And public display
of sexual paraphernalia.

20:42.401 --> 20:44.734
Okay, then yes,
I called her. So what?

20:44.801 --> 20:46.033
Why'd you call her, Calvin?

20:46.100 --> 20:47.900
Swap recipes.

20:47.967 --> 20:50.367
BRENNAN:
He did it so that he could have
Annie Oakley as his groom.

20:50.434 --> 20:52.567
Oh, come on, ratting on a guy
to his wife is hardly

20:52.634 --> 20:53.900
a federal crime, is it?

20:53.967 --> 20:55.334
How'd you get
his home phone number?

20:55.401 --> 20:57.200
It was under "home"
on his cellphone.

20:57.267 --> 20:58.501
Ed Milner's an idiot.

20:58.567 --> 20:59.501
<i>Was</i> an idiot.

20:59.567 --> 21:00.534
Now he's a murder victim.

21:00.601 --> 21:01.868
So what happened there, Thor?

21:01.933 --> 21:03.134
Ed's wife showed up,

21:03.200 --> 21:05.067
but to your chagrin,
she left without him,

21:05.134 --> 21:07.933
so you do what you had to do in
order to get your groom back.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.467
Annie's one hell of a jockey,

21:10.534 --> 21:12.234
but she's not worth
killing for.

21:12.300 --> 21:15.067
I did not kill Mr. Ed.

21:15.134 --> 21:17.801
I may enjoy being dominated
by the ladies from time to time,

21:17.868 --> 21:19.167
that doesn't make me crazy.

21:19.234 --> 21:21.967
Might want to look in a mirror
there, my friend Flicka.

21:22.033 --> 21:23.900
Whoa, oh, no.

21:23.967 --> 21:25.401
I went to Stanford Law.

21:25.467 --> 21:27.200
Clerked for a federal judge.

21:27.267 --> 21:29.900
Might want to rethink
your actions there, Agent Booth?

21:35.534 --> 21:37.501
Thank you.

21:37.567 --> 21:39.601
Yeah, he's got motive.

21:39.667 --> 21:41.167
He knows about horses.

21:41.234 --> 21:42.534
What was
with all the lying?

21:42.601 --> 21:44.167
We've got voice tapes

21:44.234 --> 21:45.933
and public display
of sexual paraphernalia?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
It was role playing.

21:47.067 --> 21:49.167
I was being all lard ass
and good cop.

21:49.234 --> 21:52.300
Hard ass and bad cop, Bones.

21:52.367 --> 21:54.701
Hard ass and bad cop.

21:59.900 --> 22:02.834
What's going on?

22:02.900 --> 22:04.000
You first.

22:04.067 --> 22:07.200
Cantaloupes.

22:07.267 --> 22:09.067
Zack and I need them
for an experiment.

22:09.134 --> 22:10.634
Of course you do.

22:10.701 --> 22:13.567
I talked to Dr. Jasper,
that hypnotist.

22:13.634 --> 22:14.567
Yeah?

22:14.634 --> 22:16.900
She asked me to bring in photos.

22:16.967 --> 22:18.467
But all I could find

22:18.534 --> 22:19.801
are these.

22:19.868 --> 22:21.434
I'm not sure those'll
going to any help.

22:21.501 --> 22:23.834
Which is why I'm looking
for the wedding photo.

22:23.900 --> 22:25.067
You were married on the beach

22:25.134 --> 22:26.567
at dawn in the middle
of nowhere.

22:26.634 --> 22:29.601
Well, when I got off the phone
with Dr. Jasper, I remembered

22:29.667 --> 22:31.801
that somebody snapped
a Polaroid of me

22:31.868 --> 22:33.234
right after I said "I do."

22:33.300 --> 22:35.701
And I stuck it in a book
as a bookmark, but I,

22:35.768 --> 22:38.033
I can't find it.

22:38.100 --> 22:40.900
You know, I really hate going
through this story

22:40.967 --> 22:42.401
of marrying a guy.

22:42.467 --> 22:44.234
I didn't even
know his name.

22:44.300 --> 22:46.567
People are looking
at me like I'm nuts.

22:46.634 --> 22:48.067
You are.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.501
Thanks a lot.

22:49.567 --> 22:54.534
Come on, Angie,
embrace the irony.

22:54.601 --> 22:57.367
You married him,
then you're going to marry me.

22:57.434 --> 22:58.601
None of it
makes any sense.

22:58.667 --> 22:59.967
I'm supposed to take advice
from a guy

23:00.033 --> 23:01.900
who's walking around
with honeydew melons?

23:01.967 --> 23:05.234
Cantaloupes, it's a common
mistake, and hey...

23:05.300 --> 23:07.300
you need to relax.

23:09.768 --> 23:12.367
You want me there
when you go under?

23:12.434 --> 23:14.567
I can hold your hand
or something.

23:14.634 --> 23:16.367
I'm not "going under."

23:16.434 --> 23:18.300
I'm being hypnotized.

23:20.033 --> 23:24.167
Okay, this is me walking away
with my melons,

23:24.234 --> 23:25.434
so you can relax.

23:25.501 --> 23:27.768
I love you.

23:27.834 --> 23:29.834
Psycho.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.868
* Ta-da! *
The weapon was blunt,

23:37.933 --> 23:40.067
an inch wide and curved.

23:40.134 --> 23:41.167
That's unusual.

23:41.234 --> 23:42.501
Not if you're a horse.

23:42.567 --> 23:43.768
I'm not a horse.

23:43.834 --> 23:45.000
But the victim was.

23:45.067 --> 23:47.501
At least he pretended to be one.

23:47.567 --> 23:48.933
What is that?

23:49.000 --> 23:50.267
A hoof knife.

23:50.334 --> 23:52.501
They're curved to conform
with the natural shape

23:52.567 --> 23:53.567
of a horse's foot.

23:53.634 --> 23:55.000
Could I have one
of those honeydews?

23:55.067 --> 23:57.601
It's a cantaloupe.

24:00.267 --> 24:02.167
My research shows that horses 
are slaughtered 

24:02.234 --> 24:04.367
by a single blow
to the forehead.
All right now,

24:04.434 --> 24:06.067
I'm thinking that we should
place the melons

24:06.134 --> 24:08.768
at exactly five-foot-11,
which was the victim's height.

24:08.834 --> 24:09.933
Now, we should devise a plan

24:10.000 --> 24:11.300
to pull the cantaloupe away

24:11.367 --> 24:13.933
because he most likely
saw the knife coming...

24:14.000 --> 24:16.467
Okay, fine.

24:16.534 --> 24:20.000
You know, we used to think
things through together.

24:20.067 --> 24:21.801
Oh, I-I apologize.

24:21.868 --> 24:24.768
It's possible that my time
in Iraq transformed me

24:24.834 --> 24:26.300
into a man of action.

24:27.534 --> 24:28.868
I'll watch
out for that.

24:28.933 --> 24:31.401
Looks like we found
the right weapon.

24:31.467 --> 24:34.000
Mr. Ed wasn't just playing
like a horse,

24:34.067 --> 24:35.933
and having sex
like a horse.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.534
He was slaughtered
like one, too.

24:39.601 --> 24:41.934
all right, now, The victim's hands
were tied together

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
like this with
baler's twine

24:44.067 --> 24:45.967
Bales of hay
baler's twine?
Yup.

24:46.033 --> 24:47.634
It's embedded
with a UV protective filament

24:47.701 --> 24:49.801
that prolongs the life
of the twine in sunlight.

24:49.868 --> 24:50.900
The technology
is patented,

24:50.967 --> 24:52.734
and they sell directly
to the consumer.

24:52.801 --> 24:54.933
They had only 228 sales
last year.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.200
Booth can get a warrant

24:56.267 --> 24:58.267
to identify all the pony players
and cross reference.

24:58.334 --> 24:59.434
I'm on it.

25:00.467 --> 25:02.601
Hodgins?

25:02.667 --> 25:04.834
Hodgins?!

25:08.267 --> 25:09.467
Is somebody there?

25:10.868 --> 25:12.267
Hodgins?

25:12.334 --> 25:14.234
Why don't you just
open your eyes?

25:14.300 --> 25:15.801
Ah, sweetie.

25:15.868 --> 25:17.868
It'll break the spell.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.100
What spell?
Are you still hypnotized?

25:21.167 --> 25:22.100
No.

25:22.167 --> 25:23.267
It never took.

25:23.334 --> 25:24.567
Why?

25:24.634 --> 25:28.667
Because that doctor said
that I wasn't relaxed enough.

25:28.734 --> 25:30.634
Can you believe that?

25:30.701 --> 25:33.401
I mean, how would she know
if I'm relaxed or not?

25:34.734 --> 25:37.434
Well, you're twisting
your bracelet,

25:37.501 --> 25:40.300
your voice is half
an octave higher
than usual, and

25:40.367 --> 25:41.768
you smell like nervous sweats.

25:41.834 --> 25:43.401
Oh, don't say that.

25:43.467 --> 25:44.701
Really?

25:44.768 --> 25:46.734
I'm going back there
at 6:00.

25:46.801 --> 25:49.134
She says that if my pulse rate
is still above 60

25:49.200 --> 25:51.300
that she's going
to push me off till next week.

25:51.367 --> 25:53.267
Rapid pulse rate,
high blood pressure--

25:53.334 --> 25:55.900
they're indicators
of emotional distress.

25:55.967 --> 25:58.401
What, you think
I don't want to be hypnotized?

25:58.467 --> 26:00.601
I simply made
a factual observation.

26:02.701 --> 26:05.167
You think I'm afraid
of disturbing old memories?

26:05.234 --> 26:06.768
You think
that somehow

26:06.834 --> 26:08.401
I-I like this idea of Birimbau

26:08.467 --> 26:11.601
as some sort of untouchable
fantasy figure, hmm?

26:11.667 --> 26:14.734
That somehow
finding his real name will just

26:14.801 --> 26:17.033
bring him down to earth
and make this whole

26:17.100 --> 26:20.467
mishegas banal
and uninteresting?

26:20.534 --> 26:24.768
I don't know
what mishegas means.

26:24.834 --> 26:28.033
I'm not sure I know
what any of that meant.

26:28.100 --> 26:32.534
Why do I feel like I need
to apologize for something?

26:32.601 --> 26:35.667
I'll be ready next time, okay?

26:35.734 --> 26:37.768
You'll see.

26:37.834 --> 26:40.367
Could you excuse me...
sweetie?

26:41.401 --> 26:43.134
Hey, shut that door

26:52.801 --> 26:54.200
You recognize that?

26:54.267 --> 26:55.601
Yeah.

26:55.667 --> 26:57.100
That'd be twine.

26:57.167 --> 26:58.367
Yeah.

26:58.434 --> 27:00.367
Fairly specialized stuff, hmm?

27:00.434 --> 27:03.334
Doesn't deteriorate
in the sun.

27:03.401 --> 27:05.601
Only the best
for your pony clients.

27:05.667 --> 27:08.567
You got it off one
of my hay bales?

27:08.634 --> 27:10.100
Got it off the corpse
of Ed Milner.

27:10.167 --> 27:12.701
Do I need a lawyer?

27:12.768 --> 27:14.701
That's your call.

27:14.768 --> 27:16.167
I didn't kill Ed.

27:16.234 --> 27:17.933
We traced the owner of that
twine to the Ambassadora Ranch.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.200
Any of my guests

27:19.267 --> 27:21.334
could have taken this twine
off my hay bales.

27:21.401 --> 27:23.900
Your company used to be co-owned
by your ex-wife till recently?

27:23.967 --> 27:25.534
I paid her off
in the divorce.

27:25.601 --> 27:27.834
Your ex-wife being
Anne Marie Ostenbach?

27:27.900 --> 27:30.967
Rider named Annie Oakley?

27:31.033 --> 27:32.501
Ed Milner's sex partner.

27:32.567 --> 27:34.334
You can see
how things are starting

27:34.401 --> 27:36.134
to line up
against you here, Lucky?

27:36.200 --> 27:37.501
We aren't married anymore.

27:37.567 --> 27:40.134
You're going to tell me
that it doesn't bother you

27:40.200 --> 27:44.401
to see your ex-wife
playing sex games

27:48.067 --> 27:49.567
What's that?

27:49.634 --> 27:51.267
It's a warrant.

27:51.334 --> 27:54.734
I already told you,
I've got that twine
all over the ranch.

27:54.801 --> 27:56.167
We'll be looking
for a hoof knife.

27:56.234 --> 27:57.200
I've got a hoof knife.

27:57.267 --> 27:59.000
Great.
And it was
stolen.

27:59.067 --> 28:00.334
Four days ago from my truck.

28:00.401 --> 28:01.567
Did you report the theft?
Come on.

28:01.634 --> 28:03.734
Like the cops are going to care
about a $10 knife.

28:03.801 --> 28:04.834
Think I know
who did it, though.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.200
I'm listening.

28:06.267 --> 28:10.334
I have a rider client
named Tom Mularz.

28:10.401 --> 28:12.834
Couple days ago, he starts
passing out fliers advocating

28:12.900 --> 28:14.734
the consumption of horse meat,
but what do you expect?

28:14.801 --> 28:15.933
He's a butcher.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.100
Why did he break
into your truck?

28:17.167 --> 28:18.300
Well, I took the
fliers from him,

28:18.367 --> 28:19.401
I tossed them in the truck,

28:19.467 --> 28:22.401
and I kicked him out
of the convention.

28:22.467 --> 28:23.567
So, he took back the fliers and hoof knife?
I don't know.

28:23.634 --> 28:25.801
All I know is,
I came out the next morning,

28:25.868 --> 28:27.567
the fliers were gone,
so was the knife.

28:27.634 --> 28:31.234
That is

28:31.900 --> 28:33.267
Wow.

28:33.334 --> 28:35.267
You just figured that out.

28:38.334 --> 28:41.000
Oh, I found something

28:41.067 --> 28:42.834
very interesting.
The victim's

28:42.900 --> 28:46.000
feet were severed from the body
with remarkable skill.

28:46.067 --> 28:48.601
Excellent insight, Zack,
but the polite response is,

28:48.667 --> 28:50.401
"Really, Hodgins?

28:50.467 --> 28:51.701
What did you find?"

28:51.768 --> 28:53.434
There's a sharp force
disarticulation

28:53.501 --> 28:56.601
from the distal tibia
and fibula, passing

28:56.667 --> 28:58.134
cleanly above the talus.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.734
No. I wasn't asking you.

28:59.801 --> 29:01.467
I was telling you

29:01.534 --> 29:02.768
you should ask me.

29:02.834 --> 29:04.434
Really, Hodgins?

29:04.501 --> 29:05.701
What did you find?

29:05.768 --> 29:08.601
The feet were severed
with the hoof knife.

29:08.667 --> 29:10.434
I know.
Because I told you.

29:10.501 --> 29:12.267
No, because I examined the cuts

29:12.334 --> 29:14.467
under the confocal
laser-scanning microscope.

29:14.534 --> 29:16.234
How did you find out?

29:16.300 --> 29:17.567
Traces of steel left
on the skull

29:17.634 --> 29:20.100
match traces of steel
left on the feet.

29:20.167 --> 29:21.434
Same weapon.

29:21.501 --> 29:22.768
Same weapon.

29:22.834 --> 29:24.467
You suck all the fun

29:24.534 --> 29:26.334
out of every moment of personal truimph

29:32.134 --> 29:34.234
I hate the smell
of a butcher shop.

29:34.300 --> 29:37.000
Oh, maggots and rotting faces
and burst guts don't bother you,

29:37.067 --> 29:39.000
but the smell
of a butcher shop does?

29:39.067 --> 29:41.000
It's a very small step
between selling dead meat

29:41.067 --> 29:43.000
and making meat dead.

29:43.067 --> 29:45.501
I'm considering
becoming a vegetarian.

29:45.567 --> 29:46.801
Not me.

29:46.868 --> 29:48.967
Yeah, that's why I
said, "I," not, "we."

29:49.033 --> 29:51.834
Zack said that the
killer was adept at
cutting through bone.

29:51.900 --> 29:53.701
Like a butcher.
Yeah.

29:53.768 --> 29:55.267
"Horse Meat--

29:55.334 --> 29:58.634
Sweet, Rich, Lean and Soft."

29:58.701 --> 29:59.734
Can I help you?

29:59.801 --> 30:02.933
Yeah, we're looking
to score some horse meat.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.701
there's only two slaughterhouses

30:04.768 --> 30:07.000
in the U.S., and they don't export to Virginia.

30:07.067 --> 30:08.334
Oh, that's a shame.

30:08.401 --> 30:09.601
You Tom Mularz?

30:09.667 --> 30:10.868
Why?

30:10.933 --> 30:12.768
I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth.

30:12.834 --> 30:13.701
This here... Oh.

30:13.768 --> 30:16.334
Go around, cut him off.

30:18.567 --> 30:21.667
Stop, or I'll kick you in the testicles.

30:23.467 --> 30:24.567
You are strong.

30:24.634 --> 30:26.834
Well, you know, I try to stay in shape.

30:26.900 --> 30:28.834
Stop, or I'll kick you in the testicles?

30:28.933 --> 30:29.967
It worked.

30:30.033 --> 30:31.667
I'll tell you what... you and me,

30:31.734 --> 30:33.501
we're going to work on the cop talk.

30:35.434 --> 30:36.734
What did you hit me with?

30:36.801 --> 30:38.067
- A building. - You know what?

30:38.134 --> 30:40.300
I've been thinking about the psychology of all this.

30:40.367 --> 30:42.734
All right, you know, I know that you hate that,

30:42.801 --> 30:45.567
but just go with me here, okay?

30:45.634 --> 30:47.167
Tom is a butcher.

30:47.234 --> 30:49.634
He advocates the consumption of horse meat.

30:49.701 --> 30:51.267
Ed Milner was horse meat.

30:51.334 --> 30:54.000
I can see that. Symbolically.

30:54.067 --> 30:55.200
Who's Ed Milner?

30:55.267 --> 30:57.434
Mr. Ed ring a bell?

30:57.501 --> 30:59.000
He's dead?

30:59.067 --> 31:00.567
Yeah.

31:00.634 --> 31:02.367
Oh, man.

31:02.434 --> 31:04.534
He was a good pony.

31:04.601 --> 31:05.834
Okay.

31:05.900 --> 31:07.801
Did you ride Mr. Ed?

31:07.868 --> 31:09.401
No.

31:09.467 --> 31:12.334
No. I'm a... I'm a rider, 
but I prefer female horses.

31:12.401 --> 31:13.601
I just...

31:13.667 --> 31:15.367
I just admired his...

31:15.434 --> 31:17.401
his style.

31:17.467 --> 31:18.933
Why did you throw me into a wall?

31:19.000 --> 31:20.300
Why did you run? Well, you're FBI.

31:20.367 --> 31:22.868
Oh, I need a little bit more than that.

31:26.534 --> 31:28.567
I'm a deserter.

31:28.634 --> 31:30.134
They send the FBI after deserters.

31:30.200 --> 31:31.501
A deserter from what?

31:32.933 --> 31:34.868
The National Guard.

31:34.933 --> 31:40.067
I signed up to save people from floods 
and earthquakes and stuff, but not to kill them.

31:40.134 --> 31:42.434
We found your fingerprints 
on Lucky's truck.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.734
Well, I broke into it to get my fliers back.

31:44.801 --> 31:46.768
- They're mine. 
- Your horse meat fliers?

31:46.834 --> 31:50.534
Why can't they see that if we 
revere horses sexually,

31:50.601 --> 31:52.267
then eating their flesh

31:52.334 --> 31:54.834
is an act of holy communion?

31:56.334 --> 31:58.367
You know what? There's crazy pony players,

31:58.434 --> 31:59.834
then there's really whacked out

31:59.900 --> 32:01.534
- crazy pony players. - Yeah.

32:03.467 --> 32:06.100
What did you do after you got your fliers back?

32:06.167 --> 32:08.000
I drove straight to my folks in Jersey.

32:08.067 --> 32:09.067
When did you get there?

32:09.134 --> 32:10.367
Before midnight.

32:10.434 --> 32:11.734
They can vouch for me.

32:11.801 --> 32:13.967
And plus, I got credit card receipts from gas.

32:14.033 --> 32:15.567
You deserted the National Guard.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.000
I'm not a killer.

32:17.067 --> 32:18.300
You're a butcher.

32:18.367 --> 32:20.234
Well, not a people butcher.

32:20.300 --> 32:22.868
I'm innocent.

32:25.734 --> 32:27.634
How am I doing?

32:27.701 --> 32:29.501
Because the pressure of 
having to have a low pulse

32:29.567 --> 32:31.701
could be driving my pulse up, 
and I in no way want

32:31.768 --> 32:33.933
to be penalized for that.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.933
58 beats per minute.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.300
Very nice, Angela.

32:37.367 --> 32:39.601
I did some deep breathing.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.367
You're not going to make me

32:41.434 --> 32:42.868
cluck like a chicken, are you?

32:44.100 --> 32:45.667
Sorry.

32:45.734 --> 32:48.100
Bombs away.

32:48.167 --> 32:50.601
Let's begin.

32:51.634 --> 32:53.567
Angela,

32:53.634 --> 32:55.701
close your eyes.

32:57.701 --> 33:01.300
Take a deep, cleansing breath in...

33:01.367 --> 33:04.868
and out.

33:04.933 --> 33:06.300
Very good.

33:06.367 --> 33:08.000
Take in another breath.

33:10.634 --> 33:11.933
And out.

33:13.401 --> 33:14.933
Focus on your arms.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.868
They're very heavy.

33:16.933 --> 33:22.267
Imagine them sinking into your chair.

33:24.467 --> 33:25.933
Got your page. What's up?

33:26.000 --> 33:31.933
when you washed the maggots 
from the eye sockets,were there 
any remaining ocular tissue at all?

33:32.000 --> 33:34.701
No. Little buggers ate the eyes 
clean through to the bone. 

33:34.768 --> 33:37.100
I have an alternate explanation.

33:37.167 --> 33:38.300
For the eyes missing?

33:40.100 --> 33:43.501
Check out the tiny nicks 
around the suaorbital process,

33:43.567 --> 33:46.334
the lacrimal bone, the sphenoid.

33:46.401 --> 33:51.033
You think the killer gouged out the eyeballs?

33:51.100 --> 33:53.667
I think "gouged" is a good description
using some kind of curved instrument of

33:53.734 --> 33:54.868
Probably the hoof knife.

33:54.933 --> 33:56.634
The murderer, cutting off the feet,

33:56.701 --> 33:58.200
gouging out the eyes.

33:58.267 --> 34:00.634
This was a bloody, violent killing.

34:00.701 --> 34:02.768
Killers are often driven by fury.

34:02.834 --> 34:03.933
No, Dr. Brennan.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.234
The feet weren't lopped off.

34:05.300 --> 34:06.434
They were removed carefully.

34:06.501 --> 34:08.134
The eyes were gouged out.

34:08.199 --> 34:10.967
This was done by someone 
who was not squeamish about flesh.

34:11.033 --> 34:13.333
The butcher's alibi checked out.

34:13.400 --> 34:15.768
Booth said some of those pony people

34:15.833 --> 34:18.467
were lawyers, judges and doctors.

34:18.534 --> 34:19.967
You think a doctor did this?

34:20.033 --> 34:22.868
Someone who is good with a 
knife and not afraid of blood.

34:22.933 --> 34:24.434
Sounds like a doctor to me.

34:24.501 --> 34:28.234
Annie Oakley is a doctor, and 
she was the victim's groom, but

34:28.300 --> 34:30.367
she wasn't the only doctor 
at the convention.

34:30.434 --> 34:33.000
I found evidence of sperm in 
Ed Milner's urogenital track.

34:33.067 --> 34:35.266
Why is that relevant?

34:35.333 --> 34:37.634
Annie Oakley claims that she 
rubbed down her pony

34:37.701 --> 34:39.000
and then went to sleep.

34:39.067 --> 34:41.933
You think she had one last romp 
with the decedent?

34:42.000 --> 34:46.367
If she lied about that, 
what else is she lying about?

34:48.234 --> 34:50.501
Very good.

34:50.567 --> 34:53.768
We're ready now to begin the journey.

34:53.833 --> 34:57.167
If you can hear me,Angela, nod your head.

34:59.467 --> 35:00.667
Very good.

35:00.734 --> 35:03.534
You're on the island of Vatulolo

35:03.601 --> 35:06.134
in Fiji in the village of Nakavala.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.868
I'm pretty sure

35:07.933 --> 35:11.200
I'm on the Rialto Bridge in Venice.

35:11.267 --> 35:16.200
No. You're on the beach in Fiji.

35:16.267 --> 35:18.900
In front of you  is a red door.

35:18.967 --> 35:20.134
No.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.667
There's not.

35:21.734 --> 35:24.967
I need for you not to fight me, Angela.

35:25.033 --> 35:26.768
Do you see the door?

35:26.834 --> 35:28.501
I see the door.

35:28.567 --> 35:30.534
When you pull the door open,

35:30.601 --> 35:33.134
your husband will be 
standing in front of you.

35:33.200 --> 35:37.834
When you see him, you will greet him 
by his proper name.

35:37.900 --> 35:39.667
I'm going to pull it open.

35:39.734 --> 35:41.734
Pull the knob.

35:51.434 --> 35:53.267
Angela, I'm going to count to three,

35:53.334 --> 35:54.601
and when I reach three,

35:54.667 --> 35:56.534
you're going to open up your eyes.

35:56.601 --> 35:59.167
You're going to feel 
relaxed and refreshed.

35:59.234 --> 36:00.534
You're going to remember everything,

36:00.601 --> 36:02.534
but you're not going to be scared.

36:02.601 --> 36:05.900
One, two, three.
1  2  3

36:15.100 --> 36:16.933
Did it work? Angela,

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
you need to tell me your husband's name.

36:21.167 --> 36:25.334
I opened the door... and I saw a wasp.

36:25.401 --> 36:27.900
A White Anglo-Saxon Protestant?

36:27.967 --> 36:31.701
No, a big, flying, stinging insect.

36:31.768 --> 36:33.534
Buzzing around your husband's head?

36:33.601 --> 36:37.267
No, it no, it was the size of a of a human being

36:37.334 --> 36:39.234
It was a very large human being.

36:39.300 --> 36:41.933
I see.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.300
What does that mean to you?

36:43.367 --> 36:45.467
Nothing.

36:45.534 --> 36:46.768
It must.

36:46.834 --> 36:48.200
I'm sorry.

36:48.267 --> 36:49.634
I have no idea.

36:49.701 --> 36:53.267
Well, you're not what I would 
call a compliant personality.

36:53.334 --> 36:54.801
This is my fault? Well,

36:54.868 --> 36:57.434
perhaps another session, 
we'll explore this wasp.

36:57.501 --> 37:01.667
Yeah, and next time 
I'll open the door to what,

37:01.734 --> 37:03.200
a giant snake?

37:03.267 --> 37:05.601
I don't think so, Doc.

37:08.334 --> 37:10.434
BRENNAN:
 <i>You're an eye surgeon,</i>
 <i>Dr. Ostenbach.</i>

37:10.501 --> 37:13.467
<i>Ed Milner's eyes were</i>
 <i>cut out of his head.</i>

37:13.534 --> 37:15.167
Whoa. Don't you have to wait
till I call my lawyer?

37:15.234 --> 37:16.933
We have the right to
execute the warrant.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.401
You have the right
to call your lawyer.

37:18.467 --> 37:20.734
Lucky, Sparkles is
a litigation lawyer.

37:20.801 --> 37:22.634
Oh, a lawyer
named Sparkles.

37:22.701 --> 37:24.534
Now I'm,
I'm shivering.
Look...

37:25.801 --> 37:27.100
...you're making
a mistake.

37:27.167 --> 37:29.100
I did not kill Ed Milner.

37:29.167 --> 37:32.134
She actually killed
her pony Mr. Ed.

37:32.200 --> 37:33.167
Look, I loved Mr. Ed.

37:33.234 --> 37:35.167
But he didn't love
you back.

37:35.234 --> 37:37.234
I mean, not enough
to leave his wife.

37:37.300 --> 37:39.067
What happened, Annie,
did he talk to you

37:39.134 --> 37:40.900
befo you slapped
him on the forehead

37:40.967 --> 37:42.267
and you turned him
into a human being?

37:42.334 --> 37:43.768
you don't know anything

37:43.834 --> 37:45.000
Well, I'm pretty sure

37:45.067 --> 37:47.067
that he told you
he was going back to his wife

37:47.134 --> 37:48.567
and you convinced him

37:48.634 --> 37:50.834
to engage in one last session
of pony play.

37:50.900 --> 37:52.701
BOOTH:
You took Lucky's truck
out to the pasture,

37:52.768 --> 37:55.367
you had sex with him, and
you... finished him off.

37:55.434 --> 37:58.534
Hiding in plain sight.

37:58.601 --> 38:00.134
Thanks for making
this part easy.

38:00.200 --> 38:02.200
Th-That's a hoof knife.
So what?

38:02.267 --> 38:03.467
Your DNA will be
on the handle

38:03.534 --> 38:06.933
and Ed Milner's blood
on the blade.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.334
Mr. Ed's blood.

38:08.401 --> 38:10.501
Your pony misbehaved, so you
stabbed him in the forehead.

38:10.567 --> 38:13.267
You cut off his feet,
you bound his wrists,

38:13.334 --> 38:15.701
but his human eyes were
staring back at you,

38:15.768 --> 38:18.501
so you gouged
them out.

38:19.834 --> 38:22.167
I left my husband
for him.

38:24.467 --> 38:29.434
I left Thor for him...
and he was going to leave me?

38:31.134 --> 38:33.701
What was I supposed to do?

38:41.334 --> 38:44.801
So... I, uh, I looked up
"wasp" in dream theory.

38:44.868 --> 38:45.834
I love dream theory.

38:45.900 --> 38:46.834
I know you do.

38:46.900 --> 38:48.534
And guess what I found:

38:48.601 --> 38:52.067
A wasp signifies
anger and envy.

38:52.134 --> 38:53.067
Bees are good.

38:53.134 --> 38:54.300
Any chance it
was a bee?

38:54.367 --> 38:55.834
No, Jack.

38:59.434 --> 39:02.401
A book about nuclear radiation
creating a giant wasp.

39:02.467 --> 39:04.768
I was reading it in Fiji.

39:04.834 --> 39:07.200
I mean, between all the
snorkeling and the...

39:07.267 --> 39:08.334
Sight... seeing.

39:08.401 --> 39:09.367
Let's go with that.

39:09.434 --> 39:10.501
What's it mean?

39:10.567 --> 39:12.701
Look inside.

39:14.267 --> 39:16.234
That's Birimbau.

39:18.267 --> 39:20.701
His face is turned so there's
still not much to go on.

39:20.768 --> 39:22.434
The guy is a giant.

39:22.501 --> 39:24.000
Flip the picture.

39:24.067 --> 39:26.900
"Angie and Grayson."

39:26.967 --> 39:29.601
His name was Grayson.

39:29.667 --> 39:31.567
Grayson Barasa.

39:31.634 --> 39:34.868
Once I say the first name,
the rest of it just flows out.

39:34.933 --> 39:36.134
Grayson Barasa.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.134
You did it, Angie.

39:38.200 --> 39:41.067
You really do
want to find him.

39:41.134 --> 39:43.401
I really, really do.

39:43.467 --> 39:44.734
To divorce him?

39:44.801 --> 39:47.967
I want a divorce.

39:48.033 --> 39:50.167
And then I want a wedding.

40:11.567 --> 40:15.100
There are many health
benefits to being vegetarian.

40:15.167 --> 40:21.167
It's a rational choice in a
world where food supplies...are affected by
global warming issues.

40:21.234 --> 40:22.434
what'bout going with taste issues?

40:22.501 --> 40:26.334
Is that meat sweet, rich,
super lean, and soft?

40:28.367 --> 40:30.401
What? Does it taste
like horse meat?

40:30.467 --> 40:32.801
Maybe you should consider
going vegetarian, too.

40:32.868 --> 40:33.834
I didn't lose my appetite

40:33.900 --> 40:35.300
because you mentioned
horse meat.

40:35.367 --> 40:36.567
I lost my appetite

40:36.634 --> 40:38.768
because you made me think
about all those people

40:38.834 --> 40:41.801
parading around pretending
to be something they aren't

40:41.868 --> 40:44.134
just so they could have
crappy sex.

40:44.200 --> 40:45.467
How do you know
it's crappy?

40:45.534 --> 40:47.601
Gotta be, Bones.

40:47.667 --> 40:49.601
Come on, it's gotta be
Why?

40:51.167 --> 40:53.534
Why?

40:53.601 --> 40:55.701
I'll tell you why.

40:55.768 --> 40:58.701
Here we are,
all of us,

40:58.768 --> 41:01.667
basically alone,
separate creatures,

41:01.734 --> 41:03.467
just circling
each other,

41:03.534 --> 41:05.434
all searching
for that slightest hint

41:05.501 --> 41:07.134
of a real connection.

41:07.200 --> 41:09.100
Some look
in the wrong places,

41:09.167 --> 41:10.567
<i>some-- they just give up hope</i>

41:10.634 --> 41:12.601
<i>because, in their mind,</i>
 <i>they're thinking,</i>

41:12.667 --> 41:15.134
<i>"Oh, there's nobody</i>
 <i>out there for me,"</i>

41:15.200 --> 41:18.768
<i>but all of us, we keep trying</i>
 <i>over and over again.</i>

41:18.834 --> 41:20.234
<i>Why?</i>

41:20.300 --> 41:23.701
<i>Because every once in a</i>
 <i>while... every once in a while,</i>

41:23.768 --> 41:27.401
<i>two people meet</i>
 <i>and there's that spark,</i>

41:27.401 --> 41:30.701
<i>and yes, Bones, 
he's handsome  and she's beautiful</i>

41:30.768 --> 41:34.434
<i>and maybe</i>
 <i>that's all they see at first,</i>

41:34.501 --> 41:36.634
but making love...

41:36.701 --> 41:40.367
making love...

41:40.434 --> 41:44.900
that's when two people
become one.

41:46.134 --> 41:49.367
It is scientifically
impossible

41:49.434 --> 41:51.334
for two objects to
occupy the same space.

41:51.401 --> 41:54.334
Yeah, but what's important
is we try,

41:54.401 --> 41:57.367
and when we do it right,
we get close.

41:57.434 --> 41:58.734
To what?

41:58.801 --> 42:00.267
Breaking the
laws of physics?

42:00.334 --> 42:03.300
Yeah, Bones-- a miracle.

42:05.334 --> 42:08.868
Those people with their
role-playing and their fetishes

42:08.933 --> 42:12.868
and their little sex games,
it's crappy sex,

42:12.933 --> 42:16.100
well, you know, at least
compared to the real thing.

42:19.167 --> 42:21.100
You're right.

42:21.167 --> 42:23.701
Yeah, but...

42:25.401 --> 42:27.067
Wait a second,
I just won that argument?

42:27.134 --> 42:28.334
Yep.
