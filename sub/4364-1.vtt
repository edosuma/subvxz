02:02.849 --> 02:07.487
Thomas...
Thomas, Richard - come. Wake now.

02:07.711 --> 02:08.829
I want to sleep.

02:08.854 --> 02:10.494
Come. Dress quickly, please.

02:20.919 --> 02:22.397
You are going to him?

02:22.399 --> 02:24.719
I have no choice.

02:31.999 --> 02:32.999
Elizabeth?

02:34.799 --> 02:36.679
Take this for luck.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.759
It may help you. And it cannot harm.

02:41.439 --> 02:44.159
Nothing will help me
with a man like him, Mother.

02:50.879 --> 02:51.999
Come, Richard.

02:54.199 --> 02:56.357
Where are we going, Mother?

02:56.359 --> 02:57.517
Why must we go so early?

02:57.519 --> 03:01.557
We are going to go and meet the king.
King Henry?! Is he back?

03:01.559 --> 03:04.117
No. The new king. Edward.

03:04.119 --> 03:07.477
Edward of York is not the king!
He killed our father!

03:07.479 --> 03:09.317
Ssh. He is king now.

03:09.319 --> 03:12.239
And we must show our loyalty to him.
Come on, Thomas.

04:20.079 --> 04:21.039
Stop! Thomas!

04:27.679 --> 04:28.839
Halt!

04:31.399 --> 04:33.079
Halt!

04:36.919 --> 04:38.839
Halt!

04:40.959 --> 04:44.359
Edward? Now? Really?

04:56.679 --> 04:58.039
All right. Rest a while.

05:04.999 --> 05:06.679
Is he really the king?

05:13.439 --> 05:14.959
I'm Lady Elizabeth Grey, Your Grace.

05:16.719 --> 05:18.119
Rise up.

05:23.399 --> 05:25.437
You've come to see me?

05:25.439 --> 05:27.517
I...

05:27.519 --> 05:30.077
I cannot obtain my son's
inheritance,

05:30.079 --> 05:33.319
my husband's lands which were
taken from me when he died.

05:34.359 --> 05:36.519
My boys
and I have nothing to live on.

05:37.599 --> 05:41.637
My husband was Sir John Grey.
He died in battle at...

05:41.639 --> 05:44.557
He was the leader
of the Lancastrian cavalry.

05:44.559 --> 05:47.837
They killed 700 of our men.
He nearly ran you through, Edward.

05:47.839 --> 05:49.879
He did his duty as he believed
it to be, Your Grace.

05:50.519 --> 05:52.679
He was loyal to the man
he thought king.

05:54.719 --> 05:56.639
My boys are innocent of anything.

05:58.279 --> 05:59.997
And these are his sons?

05:59.999 --> 06:03.237
My only fortune.
This is Richard and Thomas Grey.

06:03.239 --> 06:05.397
Edward, you don't have time for her!

06:05.399 --> 06:07.477
Your home is near here?

06:07.479 --> 06:09.917
It is over the fields!
And very near.

06:09.919 --> 06:12.199
Warwick. Lead the men on.

06:13.479 --> 06:15.479
I'll catch up with you.

06:17.719 --> 06:20.079
The men may go on. I'll escort you.

06:23.239 --> 06:24.759
Forward!

06:34.839 --> 06:36.717
We met the king. I know.
We met the king!

06:36.719 --> 06:37.759
Go back to Mama.

06:41.039 --> 06:43.159
You are very welcome to
Grafton Manor, Your Grace.

06:43.279 --> 06:49.319
Jacquetta Woodville!
Is the pageboy at home as well?

06:50.399 --> 06:52.317
Baron Rivers is away, unfortunately.

06:52.319 --> 06:54.997
Ha ha, I forgot!

06:54.999 --> 06:57.757
Baron Rivers!

06:57.759 --> 07:00.917
A hastily made-up title
to cover red faces when

07:00.919 --> 07:06.117
a high-born Lancastrian lady bedded
a grubby commoner, as I recall!

07:06.119 --> 07:09.277
He was a squire, and always twice
the man that you are, Lord Warwick.

07:09.279 --> 07:10.357
Aha...

07:10.359 --> 07:12.239
Will you take a glass of small ale,
Your Grace?

07:13.039 --> 07:15.637
Or we have some fine
wine from my cousins in Burgundy.

07:15.639 --> 07:17.197
Edward!

07:17.199 --> 07:19.797
Surely, you are not...

07:19.799 --> 07:23.997
I'll take the wine,
with thanks, Lady Rivers.

07:23.999 --> 07:26.757
Boys.
I have an important job for you.

07:26.759 --> 07:28.079
Guard Fury for me.

07:37.719 --> 07:40.639
There is not a man on earth
who could ride past my daughter,
Your Grace.

07:41.879 --> 07:44.437
Not one with his sight, anyway.

07:44.439 --> 07:46.279
Good health, Your Grace.

07:56.719 --> 07:59.439
Oh! Excuse me.

08:07.039 --> 08:08.839
Sit.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.919
Aren't you happy here,
with your father and mother?

08:23.199 --> 08:25.317
I love my parents.

08:25.319 --> 08:27.959
I am used to running my own lands
and household.

08:29.879 --> 08:33.996
My sons will have nothing
if I can't reclaim them.

08:33.999 --> 08:37.597
Too many have
suffered during these wars.

08:37.599 --> 08:41.277
But if I can keep my throne,
I will see the law of England

08:41.279 --> 08:45.477
run from one coast to the other,
and we will all be Englishmen again.

08:45.479 --> 08:48.759
I wish for nothing more than
that my sons will never fight.

08:52.919 --> 08:54.359
Do you think it possible?

08:56.879 --> 08:59.077
There must be one more battle.

08:59.079 --> 09:03.637
Henry has regained his wits,
for now at least,

09:03.639 --> 09:06.359
but I will try
and keep it from your door, my lady.

09:08.479 --> 09:10.999
You are confident of winning.

09:13.559 --> 09:18.237
I am quick, I am brave
and I am lucky.

09:18.239 --> 09:20.239
I am as lucky in battle...

09:21.399 --> 09:22.719
as I am in love.

09:26.239 --> 09:30.157
I will win. Thank you for the wine.

09:30.159 --> 09:31.357
You're leaving?! Yes.

09:31.359 --> 09:33.797
We have not yet... Write down
the details of your claim,

09:33.799 --> 09:36.397
the land you say is yours
and the details of your ownership.

09:36.399 --> 09:39.999
Yes, of course. And I shall collect
the paper from you tomorrow.

09:43.159 --> 09:44.199
On my own.

10:03.679 --> 10:05.397
Well?

10:05.399 --> 10:07.839
He is... He's coming back tomorrow.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.919
Of course he is.

10:26.799 --> 10:29.639
Mother, where are you taking me?

10:31.039 --> 10:32.519
You'll see.

10:47.999 --> 10:49.157
Choose a thread.

10:49.159 --> 10:52.957
Magic? Do you want to be
drowned on a ducking stool?

10:52.959 --> 10:54.757
It's forbidden and you promised.

10:54.759 --> 10:56.517
No-one knows but you and I.

10:56.519 --> 10:59.557
We are descended
from the river goddess Melusina.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.757
Magic is in our blood, Elizabeth.

11:01.759 --> 11:03.119
Now choose a thread.

11:21.599 --> 11:22.637
What were they?

11:22.639 --> 11:24.997
Things that you will never know.

11:24.999 --> 11:28.677
Children who will not be born,
chances you will not take.

11:28.679 --> 11:30.237
They are lost to you.

11:30.239 --> 11:34.357
And what will I catch at the end of
this fishing line of yours, Mother?

11:34.359 --> 11:35.399
The future.

11:37.159 --> 11:40.239
Reel it in. A foot every day.

12:10.639 --> 12:12.917
Argh!

12:12.919 --> 12:14.719
Lizzie, Lizzie!

12:16.799 --> 12:18.519
It's the... I know who it is.

12:37.359 --> 12:38.639
Lady Elizabeth.

12:41.359 --> 12:42.759
JACQUETTA!

12:52.279 --> 12:53.839
Baron Rivers.

12:56.679 --> 12:58.639
Sh! Sh!

13:05.959 --> 13:08.999
Your Grace. And these are my sons.

13:10.079 --> 13:13.437
Anthony, John. We've met.

13:13.439 --> 13:16.037
At the battle of Towton.

13:16.039 --> 13:19.157
When you slaughtered
half of England in one day.

13:19.159 --> 13:22.917
And in Calais, when your father
insulted my mother over her marriage

13:22.919 --> 13:25.037
and called my father a nobody.
Anthony.

13:25.039 --> 13:27.797
Because you backed a king
whose court was poison,

13:27.799 --> 13:30.117
whose taxes were unpayable

13:30.119 --> 13:33.757
and who murdered men
he had smiled on and pardoned!

13:33.759 --> 13:36.437
And yet you called him pious!

13:36.439 --> 13:41.359
Well, now your pious Henry
is defeated, and I am King.

13:46.679 --> 13:49.357
Lady Elizabeth tells me
she has lost her marriage lands.

13:49.359 --> 13:52.037
She didn't lose them,
they were taken.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.557
And all she asks for is justice.

13:54.559 --> 13:57.077
Justice! From the Yorks!

13:57.079 --> 14:00.837
Your Lancastrian Queen
murdered my father and brother,

14:00.839 --> 14:02.837
and stuck their heads on spikes.

14:02.839 --> 14:05.239
So do not talk to me of justice!

14:11.719 --> 14:13.959
Have you written
down your claim for me?

14:16.479 --> 14:17.719
Yes.

14:22.119 --> 14:24.879
Then they'll be returned to you.
By your King.

14:26.639 --> 14:28.719
Thank you. Elizabeth.

14:29.799 --> 14:34.557
Lady Elizabeth, would you show me
around the gardens before I leave?

14:34.559 --> 14:36.637
The air in here is...

14:36.639 --> 14:37.799
stale.

14:42.639 --> 14:44.399
I cannot stay for long.

14:45.679 --> 14:48.839
Henry's Queen is bringing the French
to join his northern army.

14:50.399 --> 14:51.759
I must be ready for them.

14:52.839 --> 14:55.077
You don't fear you may lose?

14:55.079 --> 14:57.717
Isn't that what you would wish?

14:57.719 --> 14:59.759
Are you not on the side
of Lancaster?

15:00.839 --> 15:02.719
I wish there were no sides.

15:04.799 --> 15:07.397
May I send a pageboy
to bring you to me tonight?

15:07.399 --> 15:09.997
I have a longing for you,
Lady Elizabeth.

15:09.999 --> 15:11.557
More than I have felt for any woman.

15:11.559 --> 15:13.879
Your Grace,
I cannot be your mistress.

15:15.639 --> 15:18.157
I may die in battle
and this could be my last request.

15:18.159 --> 15:19.559
You would deny your King that?

15:20.879 --> 15:22.917
You will not die.

15:22.919 --> 15:25.717
You are quick

15:25.719 --> 15:28.637
and brave and lucky.

15:28.639 --> 15:31.039
Then I must go?
And this be the end of it? No.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.037
Tomorrow.

15:36.039 --> 15:37.039
At sunset.

15:38.159 --> 15:40.799
Meet me by the big oak tree
where I first saw you.

15:41.879 --> 15:43.479
Even if only to say goodbye.

15:49.839 --> 15:53.077
She shouldn't have gone with him
alone.

15:53.079 --> 15:55.557
He's a lecher. They are looking
at the garden, Richard.

15:55.559 --> 15:57.117
And what comes next?!

15:57.119 --> 16:00.117
He will not return her lands
for charity!

16:00.119 --> 16:02.157
We are Lancastrians
who stood against him.

16:02.159 --> 16:04.757
He will want payment.
If he has not taken it already!

16:04.759 --> 16:06.557
He's bedded every
woman in his court,

16:06.559 --> 16:08.119
why would he not take Elizabeth?

16:09.519 --> 16:12.277
He could be forcing her this moment
while we argue! Shhh... John.

16:12.279 --> 16:14.037
He will not take her in a rosebush,
John.

16:14.039 --> 16:15.397
How can you possibly know that?

16:15.399 --> 16:17.557
He will summon her to court
when she is obligated.

16:17.559 --> 16:18.879
When he has returned her lands.

16:22.159 --> 16:24.037
Is that not so, Elizabeth?

16:24.039 --> 16:26.639
I only ask for what is mine
to be returned to me.

16:27.919 --> 16:31.317
I ask for justice, and the King
has promised it as he should.

16:31.319 --> 16:33.479
A hard man to deny,
though, Elizabeth.

16:34.879 --> 16:39.637
And if he summons you to court,
how will you answer?

16:39.639 --> 16:41.999
However you advise me
at the time, Father.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.437
Will anyone play chess?

16:47.439 --> 16:50.237
Well, I shall certainly
advise against it.

16:50.239 --> 16:52.317
It is not you we question.

16:52.319 --> 16:54.997
That man has been through
half the wives of London.

16:54.999 --> 16:57.637
And the Yorkist army
rape our women as they go.

16:57.639 --> 16:59.357
As does King Henry's.

16:59.359 --> 17:01.159
And at least this new king
has his wits.

17:02.479 --> 17:04.916
We were once friends
with that witless King.

17:04.919 --> 17:07.517
And his Queen.
Or have you forgotten, Jacquetta?

17:07.519 --> 17:09.477
I don't forget.

17:09.479 --> 17:12.117
But the wheel of fortune
rises and it falls.

17:12.118 --> 17:15.676
And the Queen, my friend,
became too vicious,

17:15.679 --> 17:16.997
and now this man is King

17:16.999 --> 17:18.999
and Elizabeth needs her lands
returned to her.

17:20.118 --> 17:21.839
Just not at any price.

17:30.399 --> 17:32.399
It's not just the lands you want
though, is it?

17:33.639 --> 17:35.077
You want him too.

17:35.079 --> 17:36.479
He is the King of England.

17:37.999 --> 17:41.077
I must show loyalty
if I am to have my land.

17:41.079 --> 17:43.279
How else can a poor widow make
her way in the world?

17:47.599 --> 17:50.997
You'd be a fool to sell yourself
too cheaply, Elizabeth.

17:50.999 --> 17:53.119
I don't intend to sell myself
at all.

18:58.639 --> 18:59.799
I knew you'd come.

19:01.239 --> 19:02.759
I can't stay for long.

19:10.119 --> 19:12.039
Let down your hair so I may see it?

19:25.759 --> 19:26.999
I am mad for you.

19:28.799 --> 19:31.237
I've been thinking about you
all day long.

19:31.239 --> 19:33.399
Shouldn't you be
thinking about your battle?

19:45.479 --> 19:46.479
Sit with me.

20:06.079 --> 20:07.479
Edward, I can't.

20:15.439 --> 20:16.479
Elizabeth...

20:18.519 --> 20:20.639
No. No. I can't.

20:24.799 --> 20:26.357
I told you, no! I meant it.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.557
You came to meet me!

20:27.559 --> 20:29.517
To say goodbye!
And now I shall say it and go!

20:29.519 --> 20:30.679
Don't run away.

20:38.039 --> 20:40.239
Dear God, Elizabeth,
let me have you.

20:43.439 --> 20:44.879
I'm desperate for you...

20:57.559 --> 21:01.199
No. No. No. I said, no!

21:03.039 --> 21:04.719
No. No.

21:12.199 --> 21:14.997
You draw a knife on me?!
Upon your King?

21:14.999 --> 21:16.237
That is treason!

21:16.239 --> 21:17.719
I draw the blade upon myself.

21:19.039 --> 21:22.437
If you come one step closer, I will
cut my throat and die right here.

21:22.439 --> 21:23.757
Play-acting.

21:23.759 --> 21:26.197
I'm sorry if I have misled you
in my coming here,

21:26.199 --> 21:28.437
but I will not be your mistress.

21:28.439 --> 21:30.797
I could take that from you
in a single second.

21:30.799 --> 21:32.959
Not before I slice my throat.
Stop it!

21:36.399 --> 21:39.559
Don't doubt my courage, Your Grace.

21:40.999 --> 21:42.759
I'm match for any man.

21:47.359 --> 21:48.399
So I see.

21:52.079 --> 21:54.399
You may keep my dagger
as a souvenir.

21:55.759 --> 21:58.317
Your Grace?
You have made a fool of me.

21:58.319 --> 22:00.479
You may congratulate yourself
on that.

22:02.439 --> 22:03.759
You'll never see me again.

22:44.999 --> 22:47.477
You've had no word from him,
no token?

22:47.479 --> 22:49.079
He said I would never see him again.

22:50.279 --> 22:53.637
Well, they say the battle
will be any day now,

22:53.639 --> 22:54.717
and if King Henry wins

22:54.719 --> 22:57.837
then it will not matter what Edward
thinks or does for he will be dead

22:57.839 --> 22:59.917
and you will have your lands
back either way.

22:59.919 --> 23:02.797
But you know that there's more
to it than that, mother.

23:02.799 --> 23:06.319
He asked me to lie with him
and I refused.

23:07.799 --> 23:10.317
And if he dies,
I'll regret that for ever!

23:10.319 --> 23:12.317
I regret it now.

23:12.319 --> 23:14.557
You are a girl
from the House of Lancaster,

23:14.559 --> 23:17.237
and you live in a country
that is divided.

23:17.239 --> 23:19.597
You may not fall in love
with a York King

23:19.599 --> 23:21.637
unless there is some profit
in it for you.

23:21.639 --> 23:24.397
Your life will not be easy
because you wish it to be so.

23:24.399 --> 23:27.717
You will have to wade through blood
and you will know loss,

23:27.719 --> 23:29.637
you must be stronger.

23:29.639 --> 23:31.477
And this is your fortune for me?

23:31.479 --> 23:33.277
What do you foresee for yourself?

23:33.279 --> 23:36.837
I know what you think, Mother,
but I don't share your gifts.

23:36.839 --> 23:40.477
I'm the daughter of a humble squire.
I have no seeings or foresight.

23:40.479 --> 23:42.157
You are of my line.

23:42.159 --> 23:44.399
And you will come to know
that in time.

23:45.719 --> 23:48.439
But what I foresee is that you
may have whatever you want...

23:50.559 --> 23:52.639
if you will take the consequences.

24:35.119 --> 24:36.799
Hold the horses!

24:39.639 --> 24:41.197
What is it, Father?

24:41.199 --> 24:43.757
A muster. We are to go to war again.

24:43.759 --> 24:47.117
No. Why? Why you, Anthony
or my brothers? Not again?!

24:47.119 --> 24:49.757
The King has commanded me
to provide a dozen men.

24:49.759 --> 24:53.999
Fitted and kitted to march under his
command against the Lancaster King.

24:55.279 --> 24:56.757
We are to change sides.

24:56.759 --> 24:58.557
Did he say anything else?

24:58.559 --> 25:01.797
It's a muster, not an invitation
to a May Day breakfast.

25:01.799 --> 25:03.517
What do you expect him to say?

25:03.519 --> 25:06.479
They will be through the day after
tomorrow. The men will fall in then.

25:18.239 --> 25:20.157
Perhaps we should go out
and wave them off.

25:20.159 --> 25:23.157
I'm sure the girls would
like to see the army on their way.

25:23.159 --> 25:24.317
John!

25:24.319 --> 25:27.517
Have you not had your fill
of seeing men go off to war?

25:27.519 --> 25:29.637
We should show our support, Richard.

25:29.639 --> 25:31.637
If he wins,
it will be better for us,

25:31.639 --> 25:34.437
and if he loses no-one will remember
that we wished him well

25:34.439 --> 25:36.517
and we can soon deny it.

25:36.519 --> 25:40.317
I'm paying them, aren't I?
Arming them from what I have!

25:40.319 --> 25:43.477
And we should find a purse of gold
from the treasure room
for His Grace.

25:43.479 --> 25:46.357
A purse of gold
to wage war against King Henry?

25:46.359 --> 25:48.237
What, woman,
have you lost your wits?

25:48.239 --> 25:50.279
Are we Yorkists now?!

25:51.839 --> 25:54.037
Yes, if he wins,

25:54.039 --> 25:55.877
and he is likely to.

25:55.879 --> 25:58.277
For then he will control
all our fortunes,

25:58.279 --> 26:00.797
and all the marriages

26:00.799 --> 26:03.119
and there are many girls
in this family, Richard.

26:07.719 --> 26:11.119
Sometimes, woman,
you even scare me.

26:14.119 --> 26:15.717
Very well.

26:15.719 --> 26:16.957
We'll do it your way.

26:16.959 --> 26:20.917
And we'll wear white roses too,
if you wish,

26:20.919 --> 26:22.719
if you can find some this early.

26:30.919 --> 26:35.997
Let's go! I'm so excited!
Those ribbons are beautiful!

26:35.999 --> 26:39.519
Can I borrow your green dress?
Can I borrow your green dress?

26:44.239 --> 26:48.119
We don't want to be late! Hurry up!
Hurry up! Come on!

27:45.359 --> 27:49.437
My men, Your Grace,
all sworn to your service.

27:49.439 --> 27:51.157
I won't forget your support.

27:51.159 --> 27:53.677
Nor how dizzyingly quick
it was conjured out of nowhere!

27:53.679 --> 27:55.157
Tell me, if I scratch that rose,

27:55.159 --> 27:57.357
will I find its true red colour
underneath?

27:57.359 --> 27:59.359
Leave it, Warwick.

28:01.719 --> 28:02.719
Your Grace.

28:06.039 --> 28:08.119
We offer you this
to help your cause.

28:12.439 --> 28:14.477
You never accepted
your defeat at Towton,

28:14.479 --> 28:17.077
nor given up hope of mad old Henry
back on the throne.

28:17.079 --> 28:19.317
It seems no matter what we do,

28:19.319 --> 28:21.277
we lose in your eyes, Warwick.

28:21.279 --> 28:22.759
I cannot sleep.

28:24.919 --> 28:27.477
I haven't slept
since I last saw you.

28:27.479 --> 28:29.039
Nor I.

28:30.399 --> 28:31.959
Nor can I eat.

28:33.279 --> 28:34.479
No.

28:37.359 --> 28:38.359
Because of me?

28:40.919 --> 28:41.919
Yes.

28:45.639 --> 28:46.679
So, is this love then?

28:48.079 --> 28:49.757
Is this what it feels like?

28:49.759 --> 28:51.757
I thought you were well versed
in love.

28:51.759 --> 28:54.439
Not love. Perhaps the other!

28:57.519 --> 28:59.599
I cannot ride the battle like this.

29:01.639 --> 29:02.877
I have to have you.

29:02.879 --> 29:04.479
And if you will not be
my mistress...

29:06.159 --> 29:08.477
then you must marry me.
Don't joke.

29:08.479 --> 29:10.157
Marry me.

29:10.159 --> 29:11.399
It is the only way.

29:13.559 --> 29:14.879
I'm mad for you.

29:17.319 --> 29:18.879
Will you marry me?

29:23.159 --> 29:24.479
Yes.

29:26.399 --> 29:28.317
Tomorrow, at sunrise.

29:28.319 --> 29:29.717
Meet me at your chapel.

29:29.719 --> 29:31.437
Bring your mother as a witness.

29:31.439 --> 29:32.879
I will bring my chaplain.

29:34.119 --> 29:36.037
We have to keep it secret
for a while.

29:36.039 --> 29:39.959
Trouble to be riled by me
if I am so far beneath you.

29:42.199 --> 29:43.999
May we offer you refreshment?

29:46.759 --> 29:49.437
No. But I will take supper
with you tomorrow, if I may?

29:49.439 --> 29:52.117
A few hours' hunting while
the last of the men are recruited

29:52.119 --> 29:53.119
and we'll be close by.

30:37.239 --> 30:40.399
I was early. I couldn't wait.

30:58.079 --> 31:00.359
I'm a fool! I forgot the ring!

31:02.679 --> 31:05.157
Lady Rivers, do you have a ring
that I could borrow?

31:05.159 --> 31:06.839
I...I have one.

31:45.439 --> 31:47.839
Your Grace. Thank you.

31:56.199 --> 31:58.637
Lady Rivers?
Where can I take my bride?

31:58.639 --> 32:00.997
There's a hunting lodge by the lake.

32:00.999 --> 32:03.079
I've had it made ready for you.

32:12.039 --> 32:13.439
I'm never nervous!

32:14.399 --> 32:16.319
Don't be.

32:18.439 --> 32:20.079
Don't be.

33:22.799 --> 33:27.197
Thank the Lady of Heaven
we're dining at your father's.

33:27.199 --> 33:30.319
I'm starving to death,
you wanton woman.

33:31.999 --> 33:36.157
If you'd let me out of bed,
I can get you some bread and cheese.

33:36.159 --> 33:38.997
Yes, but then you'd be gone
too long.

33:38.999 --> 33:40.919
I could not spare you.

33:46.079 --> 33:47.639
I must wash.

34:14.518 --> 34:16.516
You have no appetite, Your Grace?

34:16.518 --> 34:19.757
I thought you would be
hungry after hunting.

34:19.759 --> 34:24.397
I thought the same myself,
but I am exhausted.

34:24.399 --> 34:26.438
She led me quite a merry dance.

34:48.239 --> 34:50.799
Elizabeth, I have to go.

34:52.199 --> 34:53.397
You have to go?

34:53.399 --> 34:55.516
To battle. The men are ready.

34:55.518 --> 34:56.637
It's time.

34:56.639 --> 34:58.277
What? You must go now? Today?

34:58.279 --> 35:01.357
This moment, I'm afraid.
Or else I risk my crown.

35:01.359 --> 35:02.757
And how should you love me then?

35:02.759 --> 35:04.997
I would love you even if you
were a common pauper,

35:04.999 --> 35:06.717
and right now I'd be glad for it.

35:06.719 --> 35:10.797
Elizabeth. We must discuss - should
luck go against me and I am killed,

35:10.799 --> 35:13.237
you must say
nothing of this marriage.

35:13.239 --> 35:15.197
You would gain
nothing by revealing it.

35:15.199 --> 35:17.397
You will remember me
in your prayers, I hope,

35:17.399 --> 35:18.997
and I would like you to marry again.

35:18.999 --> 35:21.797
If you find yourself with child,
then you must leave England.

35:21.799 --> 35:23.237
Henry and his son may die young

35:23.239 --> 35:26.717
and if you have a boy, he will be
the only heir to the throne.

35:26.719 --> 35:30.559
Go to my brothers, to Warwick. They
will help you raise our York boy.

35:31.599 --> 35:33.637
Just come back to me, Edward.

35:33.639 --> 35:37.237
Elizabeth, you are not going to
lose me on the battlefield.

35:37.239 --> 35:38.717
I will die in bed

35:38.719 --> 35:42.119
beside the most beautiful queen
that England has ever known.

35:58.599 --> 36:00.597
You whore.

36:00.599 --> 36:04.077
You shamed our house and our name.

36:04.079 --> 36:07.357
And your dead husband who
gave his life fighting that usurper.

36:07.359 --> 36:09.237
No, Anthony. Don't touch me!

36:09.239 --> 36:11.197
It isn't what you think!

36:11.199 --> 36:13.877
What? My eyes deceive me? And this
is an honourable coupling?

36:13.879 --> 36:16.557
This IS honourable!

36:16.559 --> 36:20.157
We are married!

36:20.159 --> 36:21.599
Oh, dear God, Elizabeth!

36:23.839 --> 36:25.237
He's fooled you.

36:25.239 --> 36:26.637
What?

36:26.639 --> 36:29.037
Oh, my poor, dear sister!

36:29.039 --> 36:31.557
Let me guess,

36:31.559 --> 36:33.917
a secret wedding in our chapel?

36:33.919 --> 36:36.837
None of his family attended -
Lord Warwick must not be told?

36:36.839 --> 36:41.877
For now. Elizabeth, think! This is
a man who is King of England.

36:41.879 --> 36:45.037
He will marry a princess,
not some commoner from the camp

36:45.039 --> 36:47.317
of his enemy he found
begging by the roadside!

36:47.319 --> 36:48.557
He is married to me now!

36:48.559 --> 36:51.237
You are not married, Elizabeth.

36:51.239 --> 36:52.479
You've been tricked.

36:54.719 --> 36:57.077
It was a pretend service.

36:57.079 --> 36:59.277
There were witnesses.

36:59.279 --> 37:00.957
Who?

37:00.959 --> 37:04.317
Mother! And a priest!

37:04.319 --> 37:07.037
Which priest?

37:07.039 --> 37:09.797
I...I don't know.

37:09.799 --> 37:13.517
He's tricked you with a pretend
priest to get you into bed.

37:13.519 --> 37:16.237
He's done it before
and he has a bastard son.

37:16.239 --> 37:18.117
He is Warwick's puppet, Elizabeth.

37:18.119 --> 37:21.117
Without him, Edward could never have
claimed the throne.

37:21.119 --> 37:24.077
Warwick is the kingmaker.

37:24.079 --> 37:26.557
You can be very sure he will make
the queen as well.

37:26.559 --> 37:29.237
You are wrong. Edward is king!

37:29.239 --> 37:31.557
He does not have to do what
Warwick tells him.

37:31.559 --> 37:33.119
You are wrong!

38:17.479 --> 38:19.797
Elizabeth?

38:19.799 --> 38:22.359
Elizabeth? A messenger.

38:26.359 --> 38:28.357
My Lord. Thank you.

38:28.359 --> 38:29.639
Father! Is there news?

38:31.279 --> 38:33.637
Another bloody battle.

38:33.639 --> 38:34.637
Who's won?

38:34.639 --> 38:38.077
The Lancaster forces were routed.
Henry is defeated.

38:38.079 --> 38:40.437
Oh, dear God!
Edward? Edward has won?

38:40.439 --> 38:44.077
Henry has fled to the moors
with a price on his head

38:44.079 --> 38:46.197
like a border rebel.

38:46.199 --> 38:47.477
He's lost his wits again.

38:47.479 --> 38:49.757
Oh, the poor man.
And Queen Margaret?

38:49.759 --> 38:51.877
She's taken her son to Scotland.

38:51.879 --> 38:53.757
She won't give up, though.

38:53.759 --> 38:56.077
She'll never give up
until her son's on the throne.

38:56.079 --> 38:59.197
And so this war will never be over.

38:59.199 --> 39:02.237
No-one may doubt now that
Edward of York is king.

39:02.239 --> 39:04.439
And all our fortunes rest with him.

40:06.159 --> 40:07.599
Mmm...

40:09.399 --> 40:12.997
I have to go. Or father will miss me
at dinner. No, stay.

40:12.999 --> 40:16.437
You are not helping, husband.
I am not trying to help.

40:16.439 --> 40:19.077
Unless we were to
announce our marriage and then...

40:19.079 --> 40:21.877
Not yet.

40:21.879 --> 40:24.237
If he had his way,

40:24.239 --> 40:28.997
Lord Warwick would have me marry
the Princess Bona of France,

40:28.999 --> 40:31.877
and he will need some
time to see it is not to be.

40:31.879 --> 40:33.637
A few days?

40:33.639 --> 40:34.959
Weeks.

40:38.719 --> 40:41.877
Oh, Elizabeth! He is like
an older brother to me.

40:41.879 --> 40:45.357
He gave me my first sword.
He stood beside me my whole life.

40:45.359 --> 40:48.039
I must take the time to explain it
to him. I owe him that much.

40:49.519 --> 40:50.917
But you will tell him?

40:50.919 --> 40:53.877
And I will come to court as your
wife? Yes. When the time is right.

40:53.879 --> 40:58.077
May I at least tell Father,
so we can meet openly when you are...
We may as well tell the town crier!

40:58.079 --> 41:02.077
If we met openly,
the whole town would know

41:02.079 --> 41:03.957
and the rest of England soon after.

41:03.959 --> 41:06.799
We must keep our secret
a little while longer.

41:14.479 --> 41:17.917
I'm rather enjoying it, though -
aren't you?

41:17.919 --> 41:19.399
Our humble hunting lodge?

41:23.079 --> 41:24.919
I have to go.

41:31.839 --> 41:34.717
So... he didn't take you with him?

41:34.719 --> 41:37.637
He has to tell Lord Warwick first.
He must explain to him.

41:37.639 --> 41:40.397
Or perhaps Lord Warwick will explain
to Edward that he must marry

41:40.399 --> 41:44.917
the Princess Bona of France,
and throw off his little commoner.
I will not hear it, Anthony!

41:44.919 --> 41:49.637
In any case, I love Edward so much,
I would have him any way I had to.

41:49.639 --> 41:53.159
Then I'm sorry. Because I think
you've seen the last of him.

42:03.759 --> 42:04.759
My Lord.

42:09.879 --> 42:11.679
Your Grace. Your Grace.

42:13.159 --> 42:14.519
Your Grace.

42:19.359 --> 42:22.797
He writes me "Lady Elizabeth Grey".

42:22.799 --> 42:25.437
He does not say "wife",
he writes "my love"!

42:25.439 --> 42:27.837
There's nothing here that
speaks of a marriage, Mother.

42:27.839 --> 42:29.757
Not a word to prove
it ever happened.

42:29.759 --> 42:31.077
Read the rest.

42:31.079 --> 42:34.797
He writes that he's busy
but he will see me soon.

42:34.799 --> 42:37.237
The court is in London,
the council is sitting,

42:37.239 --> 42:39.957
Henry has still not been captured
and Queen Margaret has sailed

42:39.959 --> 42:43.277
home to France with her son
demanding help.

42:43.279 --> 42:46.717
He says he loves me.
He burns for me.

42:46.719 --> 42:48.637
That's lovers' words, nothing more.

42:48.639 --> 42:50.997
Does he say whether he has
spoken to Lord Warwick?

42:50.999 --> 42:54.077
He does not say.
It means he has not.

42:54.079 --> 42:56.479
What should I do?
Should I trust him?

42:58.759 --> 43:02.757
The messenger who brought your
letter also brought a summons
for your father.

43:02.759 --> 43:07.077
It has gone out to all the nobles,
requesting they attend the court.

43:07.079 --> 43:09.717
It will be to announce his marriage.

43:09.719 --> 43:11.517
That's what your father believes.

43:11.519 --> 43:12.839
To me?

43:17.399 --> 43:18.879
Or to another?

43:20.799 --> 43:22.557
It seems...

43:22.559 --> 43:24.959
the French Princess Bona
is at court.

43:27.599 --> 43:28.797
Your Grace. Your Grace.

43:28.799 --> 43:29.999
Your Grace. Your Grace.

43:35.999 --> 43:37.879
My Lords. We welcome you to court.

43:39.239 --> 43:42.397
The king has some important news
he wishes to share with you

43:42.399 --> 43:44.799
about Princess Bona of France.

43:54.359 --> 43:55.759
Lord Warwick?

44:08.319 --> 44:10.119
Whatever can be the problem now?

44:12.399 --> 44:15.477
Father, I think the king may
announce...

44:15.479 --> 44:16.959
that he is married to Elizabeth.

44:18.359 --> 44:19.559
Elizabeth who?

44:20.519 --> 44:21.759
Our Elizabeth.

44:22.879 --> 44:24.399
Are you out of your mind?

44:25.359 --> 44:27.557
Although
he married another before her.

44:27.559 --> 44:28.837
And the first lady has his son.

44:28.839 --> 44:32.199
So he might equally announce
his marriage to the first one.

44:35.319 --> 44:36.717
Dear God!

44:36.719 --> 44:39.477
I should've guessed that whore
would get her hooks into you

44:39.479 --> 44:41.077
when she lured you into her hovel.

44:41.079 --> 44:43.357
You may not call her that.
She is the queen.

44:43.359 --> 44:47.797
SHE is a roadside strumpet and this
can easily be undone. It must be.

44:47.799 --> 44:49.397
She is my queen of choice and I...

44:49.399 --> 44:51.197
Of choice?

44:51.199 --> 44:53.317
Have you gone mad? We've...

44:53.319 --> 44:56.117
We've got a peace treaty to
conclude with France

44:56.119 --> 44:58.837
and without it, that whore of Anjou
will bring the whole French army

44:58.839 --> 45:01.117
against us
and this time they will win!

45:01.119 --> 45:03.637
I cannot help it.
Well, you will have to help it!

45:03.639 --> 45:05.757
I've not spent the last
year of my life

45:05.759 --> 45:10.277
scraping to that fat French pig
for Princess Bona's hand for you

45:10.279 --> 45:11.917
to just throw it all away!

45:11.919 --> 45:14.359
Now get in there
and make the announcement.

45:23.319 --> 45:24.919
Um, thank you for your patience.

45:26.839 --> 45:29.077
We are

45:29.079 --> 45:31.599
proud and happy to announce...

45:36.839 --> 45:39.839
I am married
to Lady Elizabeth Grey.

46:44.559 --> 46:47.559
Your Grace?

46:49.359 --> 46:51.999
Sorry, that... Mm, it's beautiful.
Thank you.

46:55.799 --> 46:58.397
I have written to my family
in Burgundy,

46:58.399 --> 47:01.437
inviting them to London
for the coronation.

47:01.439 --> 47:04.637
They will confer on us the royal
position we shall need
to see this through

47:04.639 --> 47:08.197
and if we fail, they will be there
for refuge and support.

47:08.199 --> 47:11.277
You're making it sound more like
a battle, Mother, than a marriage!

47:11.279 --> 47:14.477
Oh, it IS a battle,
make no mistake, Elizabeth.

47:14.479 --> 47:16.477
The king has done what
he should not.

47:16.479 --> 47:19.637
He has married from another house,
and a commoner at that.

47:19.639 --> 47:22.679
There are many who will be cursing
our luck and wishing us to fall.

47:25.119 --> 47:28.637
But you, Elizabeth -
you may have it all.

47:28.639 --> 47:32.397
You love your husband,
and he will give you prestige, too.

47:32.399 --> 47:34.559
You are blessed. Mm?

47:35.879 --> 47:37.797
Oh, and after the Coronation,

47:37.799 --> 47:42.439
we must send your boys to live with
their kinsmen. They must learn...
No! My boys stay with me!

47:44.919 --> 47:46.519
Girls. Out!

47:50.679 --> 47:52.479
Elizabeth!

47:54.839 --> 47:58.037
You're as cold as ice!
Elizabeth... Elizabeth!

47:58.039 --> 47:59.239
I... This is a seeing!

48:00.719 --> 48:02.717
You have been warned of danger
to your boys.

48:02.719 --> 48:04.119
Now, do you see more? I...

48:07.039 --> 48:08.797
They must not be with strangers.

48:08.799 --> 48:10.557
So be it.

48:10.559 --> 48:13.517
We have had a warning and now
we will keep them close with us

48:13.519 --> 48:14.719
and they will be safe.

48:18.279 --> 48:22.279
You're of my line, Elizabeth.
I knew you had the sight.

49:20.719 --> 49:21.759
Father.

49:24.199 --> 49:25.319
Good to see you.

49:30.079 --> 49:31.719
My Lord.

49:39.039 --> 49:41.397
Do you give me your blessing,
Father?

49:41.399 --> 49:43.317
Of course I do.

49:43.319 --> 49:46.997
And you will always be my daughter,
no matter what.

49:46.999 --> 49:49.277
My little Elizabeth.

49:49.279 --> 49:50.319
Oh!

49:52.399 --> 49:55.597
Anthony. You can stay down there!
The things you said to me.

49:55.599 --> 49:57.717
I beg your forgiveness, sister.

49:57.719 --> 50:00.077
I hope you know that it
was out of love.

50:00.079 --> 50:01.757
I am happy for your joy.

50:01.759 --> 50:03.957
Get up, then.

50:03.959 --> 50:06.437
Common tart!

50:06.439 --> 50:08.437
Anthony... Anthony!

50:08.439 --> 50:12.159
We had a secret wedding.
We must expect some jibes.

50:34.079 --> 50:35.079
Elizabeth.

50:38.559 --> 50:39.759
My wife.

50:51.479 --> 50:53.957
Jacquetta Rivers. Mm-hm?

50:53.959 --> 50:55.997
So you've turned your coat to York.

50:55.999 --> 50:58.837
Margaret Beaufort. Lady Tudor.

50:58.839 --> 51:00.637
Lady Stafford now.

51:00.639 --> 51:02.077
Oh, you remarried?

51:02.079 --> 51:03.877
As women must, it seems.

51:03.879 --> 51:06.357
Though some of us
still loyal to our own house.

51:06.359 --> 51:08.677
These are different times,
Lady Margaret.

51:08.679 --> 51:11.917
Lancaster brought us only war.
King Edward will bring us peace.

51:11.919 --> 51:15.997
He is a pretender.
He has taken the throne by force.

51:15.999 --> 51:17.437
He is the king.

51:17.439 --> 51:20.559
And those who speak against him
are guilty of treason.

51:23.839 --> 51:25.199
Is all well? Mm.

51:27.759 --> 51:31.077
A common Lancastrian girl as queen.

51:31.079 --> 51:33.597
It's an insult to the lords
who fought for him,

51:33.599 --> 51:36.159
to take a bride whose family
killed for Henry.

51:38.599 --> 51:42.237
The worst part is
he kept it from you.

51:42.239 --> 51:46.837
The boy is fogged by lust.
I shall bring him back.

51:46.839 --> 51:49.637
I have sacrificed too much
to lose him now.

51:49.639 --> 51:52.359
The Rivers whore will wish
she'd never come here.

51:53.959 --> 51:57.959
My brothers - George and Richard.
My sister Margaret.

52:04.759 --> 52:07.877
My cousin, Lord Warwick.

52:07.879 --> 52:10.679
His Countess,
and daughters Isabel and Anne.

52:15.839 --> 52:20.119
My royal court,
I give you the Queen of England.

52:24.959 --> 52:27.637
Lord Warwick looks as
though he's swallowed poison.

52:27.639 --> 52:31.517
All his plans for Edward
smothered in their sleep.

52:31.519 --> 52:34.557
They'll make Edward pay for it,
though. You can be sure of that.

52:34.559 --> 52:38.599
And now
we have the joy that is his mother.

53:07.079 --> 53:10.959
Duchess Cecily.
It is an honour to meet...

53:15.159 --> 53:17.319
I am not happy about this marriage.

53:20.759 --> 53:23.277
That's a shame. We're all delighted.

53:23.279 --> 53:26.797
I would remind the Lady Rivers

53:26.799 --> 53:28.637
that the wedding was a secret one
which...

53:28.639 --> 53:32.037
Private. It was private. Not secret.

53:32.039 --> 53:35.717
I was there,
as were other witnesses.

53:35.719 --> 53:39.997
But if your son, the king, did not
invite you, then I am afraid you
must take that up with him.

53:39.999 --> 53:44.637
Your daughter is a widow
and years older than my son!

53:44.639 --> 53:45.717
I know.

53:45.719 --> 53:47.517
That's such an advantage, isn't it,

53:47.519 --> 53:50.157
as my daughter has already
proved herself fertile

53:50.159 --> 53:53.077
with two handsome
and legitimate boys, so we may

53:53.079 --> 53:56.397
feel confident that God will bless
this new royal couple with issue.

53:56.399 --> 53:59.997
Your daughter could never be royal!

53:59.999 --> 54:02.037
She's not my choice.

54:02.039 --> 54:04.917
Nor that of my nephew, Lord Warwick.

54:04.919 --> 54:07.117
Her father was a commoner!

54:07.119 --> 54:10.277
And while I might overlook THAT,
if Edward were not the king...

54:10.279 --> 54:13.719
He IS the king. And he has chosen me.

54:18.479 --> 54:21.359
Unless I should unseat him.

54:24.999 --> 54:27.557
And how would you do that,
Duchess Cecily?

54:27.559 --> 54:29.679
I could disown him.

54:31.479 --> 54:35.519
I could put his brother George
upon the throne in his place.

54:36.799 --> 54:41.759
How would you like that as
the outcome of your private
wedding, Lady Rivers?

54:45.439 --> 54:50.477
Yes. I did hear some talk,
when Edward was born.

54:50.479 --> 54:53.957
Um... it was an archer, wasn't it?

54:53.959 --> 54:56.037
By the name of, um...

54:56.039 --> 54:57.597
Blaybourne. That's it.

54:57.599 --> 55:02.357
Yes. People said that you had made
a cuckold of your husband,

55:02.359 --> 55:05.717
but in fact, I was of
the few who swore that

55:05.719 --> 55:08.557
a lady of your standing
would never stoop so low.

55:08.559 --> 55:11.877
And yet it seems you did. If that is
what you're saying, Duchess Cecily,

55:11.879 --> 55:15.637
that you admit yourself a common
whore and declare your son,

55:15.639 --> 55:16.917
the king, a bastard?

55:16.919 --> 55:19.919
For I cannot see how else
you would unseat him. Enough!

55:21.999 --> 55:23.679
Enough.

55:29.359 --> 55:32.119
So then your words against the king
will go no further?

55:33.559 --> 55:38.517
And now that we all are friends,
I believe you do know the proper

55:38.519 --> 55:42.039
custom when presented with
the Queen of England is to curtsy?

56:12.439 --> 56:15.239
It is an honour to meet you,
Duchess Cecily.

56:18.479 --> 56:20.557
I'm surprised you won her over.

56:20.559 --> 56:24.237
You must have really worked
some charm.

56:24.239 --> 56:26.757
I confess I had expected
quite a battle.

56:26.759 --> 56:30.999
She is your mother, Edward.
How much trouble could she be?

56:33.719 --> 56:38.837
Edward? Does the Earl of Warwick
like me? He makes me nervous.

56:38.839 --> 56:42.677
He made me what I am, Elizabeth.
You must love him for my sake.

56:42.679 --> 56:44.837
He's my closest kinsman.

56:44.839 --> 56:45.839
Then I shall try.

56:48.199 --> 56:52.119
But loving you is very much easier.

56:54.199 --> 56:55.239
Mmm.

56:56.439 --> 56:59.877
Now let us make a son,
to scotch the Lancastrian threat

56:59.879 --> 57:02.319
and start our dynasty.

57:25.639 --> 57:29.117
More magic?
I could have been anyone, Mother.

57:29.119 --> 57:32.317
Who else would come in here
at this time of night?

57:32.319 --> 57:34.079
I'm trying to see our futures.

57:37.879 --> 57:39.879
I said we'd keep them close.

57:44.439 --> 57:48.637
So, tell me, then,
who are my enemies?

57:48.639 --> 57:50.797
I do not need to scry
to tell you that.

57:50.799 --> 57:53.077
Lord Warwick and Duchess Cecily.

57:53.079 --> 57:56.437
Well, then - tell me
something we do not know.

57:56.439 --> 57:58.797
How many children
shall I give Edward?

57:58.799 --> 58:02.119
How many sons and daughters of...

58:04.359 --> 58:07.997
What is it?
Elizabeth, what do you see?

58:07.999 --> 58:09.439
A woman!

58:10.679 --> 58:12.957
With blood on her hands!

58:12.959 --> 58:16.117
A woman, wearing red. I...

58:16.119 --> 58:18.277
I do not know.

58:18.279 --> 58:19.959
Whose blood was it?

58:23.079 --> 58:24.479
I think it was mine.
