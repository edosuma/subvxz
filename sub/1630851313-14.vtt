20:58.332 --> 21:00.833
The way you talk to Dr. Lim.

21:00.985 --> 21:05.412
-I thought you'd feel better
after talking to him.
-Yeah.

21:05.581 --> 21:09.825
Sometimes it's hard.
Frank asks a lot of questions.

21:09.918 --> 21:12.085
And you know,
talking about things

21:12.212 --> 21:13.512
that are scary or sad

21:13.606 --> 21:18.276
can be... exhausting.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.836
I guess.

21:20.929 --> 21:23.188
But it's still a good thing
to do,

21:23.283 --> 21:25.783
so I'm gonna keep talking
to Frank,

21:25.934 --> 21:30.513
and eventually

21:30.531 --> 21:32.348
I will feel better.

21:32.366 --> 21:36.752
The things that make you sad,
am I one of them?

21:42.360 --> 21:44.135
Never.

21:44.362 --> 21:46.712
-(Jee-Yun crying)

21:46.864 --> 21:48.288

21:48.308 --> 21:50.808
-Good to see you.
-Thank you for seeing us
so late.

21:50.959 --> 21:53.460
How are you doing,
young lady?

21:53.554 --> 21:54.870
You know what,
she's really tired today.

21:54.889 --> 21:56.372
She didn't eat much,
and then I noticed

21:56.465 --> 21:59.132
-she was running a fever.
-Any bowel movements?

21:59.301 --> 22:00.876
One this morning,
but not since.

22:00.895 --> 22:02.545
-Shh. It's okay.
-Definitely a fever.

22:02.563 --> 22:05.639
-Okay. It's okay.
-Let's check the belly, okay?

22:05.733 --> 22:07.974
-(crying continues)
-Sweetheart, it's all right.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.994
He just wants to make sure
you're okay.

22:10.813 --> 22:13.331
We need to get her into
the emergency room right now.

22:13.558 --> 22:15.166
What?

22:17.228 --> 22:19.503
-Uh, I'm looking for Han.
First name...
-Howie.

22:19.655 --> 22:20.913
Hey, what happened?

22:21.065 --> 22:22.731
The doctor thinks
it's intussusception.

22:22.825 --> 22:25.751
They're running tests now
to confirm,

22:25.903 --> 22:27.236
see if her intestines
are blocked,

22:27.329 --> 22:29.329
-and if so, how serious it is.
-Okay.

22:29.498 --> 22:31.515
Okay, any theories
on an underlying cause?

22:31.667 --> 22:34.743
Viral infection. She's too young
for appendicitis.

22:34.762 --> 22:38.356
Okay, uh, could be autoimmune,
Celiac, Crohn's.

22:38.583 --> 22:41.767
A tumor. I mean,
it's a possibility, right?

22:41.919 --> 22:44.436
"None of the above" is also
one of the possibilities, okay?

22:44.589 --> 22:46.313
Sometimes kids just get
intussusception.

22:46.366 --> 22:48.607
No one knows why.
Might be a family history.

22:48.759 --> 22:52.578
Yeah, leukemia.
That's in my family history.

23:00.771 --> 23:03.005
<i> (excited chatter on video)</i>

23:04.050 --> 23:07.126
Any word from Chimney
or your sister?

23:07.220 --> 23:10.096
Uh, no. Still just
waiting on updates.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.727
Hey, uh, awesome catch.

23:16.879 --> 23:18.229
Mm.

23:19.381 --> 23:24.293
But-- and I say this with
some experience here--

23:24.311 --> 23:27.196
maybe don't let it go
to your head.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.467
It's not.

23:32.227 --> 23:35.996
(scoffs)
She should have died.

23:37.324 --> 23:40.659
Nine times out of ten,
I don't catch her.

23:40.811 --> 23:43.812
Or I don't see her in time,
I don't move fast enough.

23:43.906 --> 23:45.648
Or I grab her
and she slips through,

23:45.666 --> 23:47.407
and she takes me with her.

23:47.427 --> 23:50.577
Wait, you're obsessing over
things that didn't happen?

23:50.596 --> 23:52.930
I'm trying to figure out
how I should have saved her

23:53.081 --> 23:56.750
in a way that doesn't
involve luck. (sighs)

23:56.769 --> 23:59.186
So I'm ready for next time.

24:01.499 --> 24:04.275
My first year here,
there was this guy

24:04.426 --> 24:06.610
hanging from a roller coaster.

24:08.597 --> 24:11.340
I didn't get to him in time,
and he fell.

24:11.433 --> 24:13.600
Yeah, I remember that.

24:13.694 --> 24:15.619
I spent a lot of time

24:15.771 --> 24:20.015
running that one back
in my mind, you know.

24:20.034 --> 24:22.275
What if I had got to him faster?

24:22.295 --> 24:26.038
What if the truck had been
at a better angle?

24:26.190 --> 24:29.525
What if he had just grabbed
my damn hand?

24:29.543 --> 24:32.528
You have any epiphanies?

24:32.546 --> 24:36.474
That it didn't matter what
brilliant hypothetical scenario

24:36.701 --> 24:38.434
I could come up with.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.396
He was still gonna be dead.

24:44.208 --> 24:48.043
That lady... she didn't die,

24:48.136 --> 24:50.488
'cause you caught her.

24:53.159 --> 24:57.553
So accept it was a lucky break

24:57.646 --> 24:59.738
and move on?

24:59.832 --> 25:02.057
Look, your luck could change
tomorrow,

25:02.076 --> 25:05.044
so we take the wins
when we can get 'em.

25:06.506 --> 25:07.988
-(alarm ringing)
<i> -MAN (over P.A.): Attention,</i>

25:08.007 --> 25:09.081
<i> Station 118...</i>

25:09.233 --> 25:11.917
Anyway, luck or not,

25:12.069 --> 25:14.345
that was still a great save.

25:17.165 --> 25:19.433
(sighs heavily)

25:29.028 --> 25:31.362
-Stop what you're doing.
-I'm not doing anything.

25:31.589 --> 25:34.256
Just waiting.

25:34.349 --> 25:35.607
Shouldn't we know something
by now?

25:35.701 --> 25:38.184
-I'm gonna go ask someone.
-(exhales sharply) Maddie,

25:38.262 --> 25:40.095
this isn't your fault.

25:40.188 --> 25:41.688
We don't know what it is.

25:41.782 --> 25:43.541
Whatever it is,
it's not your fault.

25:43.768 --> 25:46.451
Even if it turns out to be
the same, exact

25:46.546 --> 25:48.212
rare form of leukemia
that your brother had,

25:48.363 --> 25:49.547
it wouldn't be your fault.

25:49.698 --> 25:51.273
I just keep thinking

25:51.292 --> 25:54.385
is it reckless or selfish

25:54.612 --> 25:56.870
to have a baby
with that family history?

25:56.964 --> 25:58.538
Well, your parents had
three kids.

25:58.558 --> 26:01.541
Two of 'em grew up to be
perfectly healthy.

26:01.619 --> 26:03.635
One didn't, but that was
30 years ago,

26:03.788 --> 26:05.729
and the field of medicine has
come a long way since then.

26:05.956 --> 26:09.567
Hell, there wasn't even a bone
marrow database back then.

26:11.478 --> 26:14.405
I can't be the reason
that she's in danger again.

26:14.481 --> 26:18.075
You're not.
You never were.

26:18.226 --> 26:21.470
Last time it was an accident.
This time...

26:21.563 --> 26:24.665
we don't even know
what it is yet.

26:25.567 --> 26:27.710
Yeah.

26:39.323 --> 26:41.682
I slammed a car door
on her hand.

26:44.495 --> 26:45.436
We were somewhere around Toledo,

26:45.587 --> 26:47.438
and we had stopped
for the night,

26:47.589 --> 26:49.273
and I had unbuckled her
from her car seat,

26:49.500 --> 26:50.833
but I realized she needed
a warmer jacket,

26:51.001 --> 26:54.278
so I was gonna go to the back
to grab one for her.

26:54.429 --> 26:56.947
(sighs) I didn't realize
she climbed out of her car seat,

26:57.099 --> 27:00.525
and I shut the door,
and her hand was there.

27:00.620 --> 27:01.860
Oh, my God.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.121
And she screamed bloody murder,
and I thought that

27:04.348 --> 27:07.182
I had maimed her for life.

27:07.201 --> 27:09.001
But I didn't.

27:14.282 --> 27:17.209
How long did you
beat yourself up for that?

27:17.303 --> 27:19.119
(scoffs)

27:19.180 --> 27:21.388
I'll let you know when I stop.

27:25.870 --> 27:28.812
By the time I saw
the RPG coming,

27:28.964 --> 27:30.981
it was too late.

27:31.133 --> 27:34.893
We got hit, and we went down.

27:35.045 --> 27:36.987
You said Mills was
the first one to see it.

27:37.214 --> 27:40.640
Did you both have the same
vantage point at the time?

27:40.734 --> 27:44.811
Uh, no. She was in the front.
I was sitting behind her.

27:44.905 --> 27:46.889
Did you have a clearer view
out the window than Mills did?

27:46.891 --> 27:50.650
Not really. I kind of had my
hands full working on Greggs.

27:50.744 --> 27:52.670
Okay, let me see
if I understand.

27:52.897 --> 27:55.397
Mills had a better view
of the ground down below,

27:55.490 --> 27:57.490
and you couldn't really
look out the window

27:57.584 --> 27:59.843
because you were trying
to save an injured man's life.

27:59.995 --> 28:03.255
Not that it mattered.
He died anyway.

28:03.407 --> 28:04.831
You regret trying to save him?

28:04.850 --> 28:08.593
What? No.

28:08.688 --> 28:10.336
I only ask because
when you talk about

28:10.356 --> 28:12.080
the chopper being shot down,
you imply that

28:12.099 --> 28:13.916
you could have done something
to stop it.

28:13.934 --> 28:17.177
From what you've told me,
the only way that's possible is

28:17.196 --> 28:19.029
if you let Greggs die.

28:19.256 --> 28:20.647
Was that ever an option?

28:20.700 --> 28:25.536
My job was trying to save him.
I was doing my job.

28:25.763 --> 28:27.871
So your job wasn't to look
for hostiles on the ground?

28:28.098 --> 28:29.114
No.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.208
Then why is it your fault

28:31.359 --> 28:33.961
that you didn't see them sooner?

28:45.207 --> 28:47.540
-Hey.
-Hey. How'd it go?

28:47.634 --> 28:50.635
Usual. Crack myself open
for 50 minutes,

28:50.788 --> 28:53.505
walk out feeling like
I was hit by a bus.

28:53.657 --> 28:55.140
I think that means
it's working.

28:55.292 --> 28:58.384
I'm supposed to feel better
at some point, right?

28:58.404 --> 28:59.461
Where's Chris?

28:59.554 --> 29:02.314
He's in his room,
finishing homework.

29:02.466 --> 29:04.074
Oh.

29:08.396 --> 29:09.654
Chris drew this?

29:09.807 --> 29:13.751
BUCK: That one's mine.
I misunderstood the assignment.

29:22.428 --> 29:26.004
Hey, you ever think that
maybe it's not worth it?

29:26.215 --> 29:29.415
Not the therapy, the...

29:29.510 --> 29:32.436
What we do for a living
that makes us need therapy.

29:32.587 --> 29:36.848
What I put myself through,
what I put my kid through.

29:37.001 --> 29:39.359
The greater good and all.

29:41.188 --> 29:43.197
Maybe that's not a thing.

29:45.175 --> 29:47.117
Maybe it's just random.

29:48.603 --> 29:52.080
If that's the case, then
what's the point of it all?

29:53.626 --> 29:55.942

Oh, tell me about it. I was
standing right next to her,

30:05.879 --> 30:07.471
and I'm still not sure
how she did it.

-Yeah, that's us.

30:19.059 --> 30:22.319
Okay. I've got good news
and great news.

30:22.470 --> 30:24.563
Well, we like how
you're starting.

30:24.715 --> 30:26.639
It was intussusception,
which we confirmed

30:26.733 --> 30:28.717
with a lower GI series
that very helpfully

30:28.735 --> 30:31.644
put her intestine back
where it belonged.

30:31.705 --> 30:33.405
It happens sometimes.

30:33.499 --> 30:36.333
But that means we don't have to
repair it surgically.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.671
Uh, what about
the underlying cause?

30:45.235 --> 30:46.993
Okay, so when can we see her?

30:47.087 --> 30:48.420
They'll be bringing her up soon.

30:48.572 --> 30:50.238
Just want to keep an eye on her
for a few hours,

30:50.257 --> 30:52.165
see if there's any adverse
reaction to the barium.

30:52.217 --> 30:54.076
Then you can take her home.

30:54.094 --> 30:55.352

early, we might not be so lucky.

30:59.583 --> 31:02.067
It was a good call
bringing her in.

31:13.280 --> 31:16.856
Man, we'd be done by now if we
hadn't lost that stop sign.

31:16.934 --> 31:19.284
Lost? Try sabotaged.

31:19.436 --> 31:20.544
Nick and Colton
probably chickened out

31:20.621 --> 31:22.212

-Tr-Trevor.

32:50.135 --> 32:51.710
Why'd you run?

32:51.862 --> 32:53.804
You would have arrested us.

32:54.031 --> 32:55.288
It was a misdemeanor.

32:55.365 --> 32:57.382
You're gonna die
over a misdemeanor?

32:57.534 --> 32:59.643
(Trevor choking)

32:59.794 --> 33:01.203
-What do we do?
-All right,

33:01.296 --> 33:02.980
we're gonna push him
on his side, he's choking.

33:03.131 --> 33:04.314
We're gonna push on three.

33:04.466 --> 33:07.542
Keep his head,
neck and back aligned.

33:07.561 --> 33:09.544
-On three.
-Okay.

33:09.713 --> 33:12.614

34:43.807 --> 34:44.989
I'll call into the ER now.

34:45.158 --> 34:47.250
-Are you good?
-Yeah.

34:47.402 --> 34:49.419
All right.

34:53.166 --> 34:54.649
GENE:
Is he okay?

34:54.668 --> 34:58.911
♪<i> For a minute there...</i> ♪

34:58.931 --> 35:01.581
What's wrong with you?

35:01.600 --> 35:04.342
We were just collecting stop
signs for the scavenger hunt.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.511
-We were just having fun.
-Fun?!

35:06.663 --> 35:09.255
Your stolen signs injured
a cyclist.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.166
Nearly punctured her artery.

35:11.184 --> 35:12.834
She barely made it
to the hospital.

35:12.853 --> 35:15.428
-Now your friend may die.
-I'm so sorry.

35:15.447 --> 35:18.022
-We were just being...
-Reckless.

35:18.117 --> 35:21.952
You think because you're young
that you're invincible?

35:22.179 --> 35:24.604
You're not.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.606
Is he gonna be okay?

35:26.625 --> 35:30.001
It's out of our hands.

35:33.523 --> 35:34.539
BAILEY:
What do we got?

35:34.633 --> 35:36.967
17-year-old male
struck by a motor vehicle

35:37.194 --> 35:38.360
at a high rate of speed.

35:38.453 --> 35:40.953
Got massive blood loss
from a leg wound

35:40.973 --> 35:43.289
and some bruising
on his abdomen,

35:43.383 --> 35:44.716
consistent with internal
bleeding.

35:44.810 --> 35:47.310
Okay. Prep the OR for
an exploratory laparotomy.

35:47.462 --> 35:49.704
Also give Ortho a heads-up.

35:49.797 --> 35:51.039
We're gonna need to try
and save that leg

35:51.132 --> 35:52.440
after we save his life.

35:56.155 --> 35:59.972
I know you. Both of you.

35:59.992 --> 36:02.975
Good to see you
on your feet this time.

36:02.995 --> 36:05.620
Thanks again.

36:07.741 --> 36:10.167
She's the trauma surgeon.

36:12.820 --> 36:15.246
Talk about your dumb luck.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.090
(scoffs)

36:21.496 --> 36:23.346
Any news on the boy
from the accident?

36:23.498 --> 36:26.090
I have a feeling that
Athena's gonna want to know.

36:26.243 --> 36:28.000
He's doing really well.

36:28.020 --> 36:30.929
Apparently he had
a really great surgeon.

36:31.081 --> 36:32.439
Oh, would you stop.

36:33.266 --> 36:35.358
-What?
-HEN: The surgeon.

36:35.510 --> 36:38.528
She was that woman that
fell off the balcony.

36:38.680 --> 36:41.589
Wow, what are the chances
of that?

36:41.591 --> 36:43.366
That's like a two-for-one
special.

36:43.518 --> 36:45.443
BOBBY:
It's a pretty busy hospital.

36:45.595 --> 36:48.688
Who knows how many people Lucy
actually saved in the long run?

36:49.857 --> 36:54.285
So, do you feel any differently
about catching her now?

36:54.362 --> 36:58.773
Doctor or not,
that woman got to live.

36:58.866 --> 37:00.217
HEN:
You know, it's weird.

37:00.444 --> 37:04.112
I never really thought
about it before, but now,

37:04.130 --> 37:06.205
I wonder how many other people

37:06.299 --> 37:07.949
we've inadvertently saved

37:07.968 --> 37:10.101
by saving someone else.

37:18.478 --> 37:19.627
BOBBY:
Hey.

37:19.646 --> 37:23.556
-Hey.
-You're up early.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.817
Oh, are you preparing for
another battle royale

37:25.969 --> 37:27.151
poker night against
the Wilsons?

37:27.304 --> 37:29.637
No, just good old solitaire.

37:29.731 --> 37:33.250
I used to play this after work
back in my rookie days.

37:33.401 --> 37:35.477
Helped keep my mind off things

37:35.479 --> 37:38.146
I couldn't shake off
from the job.

37:38.164 --> 37:39.814
How's that working for you now?

37:39.907 --> 37:43.593
I've been playing all night.
Couldn't sleep.

37:47.099 --> 37:49.599
Have you heard about that boy
from the accident?

37:49.751 --> 37:52.477
I wasn't sure I wanted to.

37:53.513 --> 37:56.255
You know Harry has
those same shoes.

37:56.349 --> 37:59.943
When you arrived on the scene,
I saw one of them

38:00.094 --> 38:01.444
in the middle of the street

38:01.596 --> 38:03.688
because that boy had been
knocked out of it

38:03.840 --> 38:05.023
when the car hit him.

38:05.175 --> 38:07.933
And all I could think was,
"Harry has those shoes."

38:07.953 --> 38:10.862
His are probably
two sizes smaller,

38:11.014 --> 38:13.123
but not for long.

38:13.274 --> 38:16.293
-Harry's a good kid.
-Yeah, well,

38:16.520 --> 38:20.112
-even good kids do dumb things.
-They do.

38:20.132 --> 38:22.357
That boy is gonna be okay.

38:22.450 --> 38:24.542
-He's made it out of surgery.
-(exhales sharply)

38:24.711 --> 38:26.544
Feel like you can sleep now,
or do you want me to make

38:26.696 --> 38:28.029
a pot of coffee
and you can deal me in?

38:28.048 --> 38:33.059
No. I am done
with games of chance.

38:35.055 --> 38:37.129
Hey, good morning.

38:37.149 --> 38:40.058
-(sighs)
-How was your shift?

38:40.152 --> 38:42.060
Uh, yeah, you know, pretty good.

38:42.154 --> 38:44.395
-Yeah?
-What are you working on?

38:44.489 --> 38:45.805
Lucy Donato.

38:45.899 --> 38:49.326
-Uh, what?
-I've been trying to get

38:49.402 --> 38:51.143
an interview with this woman
for days,

38:51.163 --> 38:52.737
but she won't return my calls.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.239
I was starting to take it
personally, but apparently

38:55.334 --> 38:57.167
she's not returning
anyone's calls.

38:57.394 --> 39:01.838
Uh, you mean she's not taking
reporters' calls, right?

39:02.065 --> 39:04.248
Exactly. So...

39:04.401 --> 39:08.160
I was thinking maybe
you could talk to her

39:08.180 --> 39:10.071
and put in a good word for me.

39:10.164 --> 39:12.498
-No. Absolutely not.
-Oh...

39:12.592 --> 39:15.668
Never gonna happen,
but-but-but, hey, hey,

39:15.745 --> 39:20.081
I will give you an exclusive
and pretty heartwarming

39:20.174 --> 39:23.342
surprise ending to the story
that no one else knows.

39:23.362 --> 39:26.588
Oh, I'm intrigued.
What's the catch?

39:26.606 --> 39:29.699
I need you to help me
find someone.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.577
(horse snorts)

39:35.874 --> 39:37.782
BUCK: Hey, so, uh,
so what do you think?

39:37.951 --> 39:40.618
-They're really tall.
-(Buck laughs)

39:40.770 --> 39:42.879
If you don't want to do this
or it gets too scary,

39:43.030 --> 39:44.029
we can leave.

39:44.049 --> 39:46.549
When do I get to ride one?

39:46.776 --> 39:49.368
Okay, maybe not that scary.

39:49.462 --> 39:52.296
First, I am gonna introduce you
to all the horses,

39:52.465 --> 39:54.724
and then I'm gonna show you
how to groom them

39:54.951 --> 39:57.619
and feed them, and then you're
gonna walk around on a lead.

39:57.637 --> 39:59.879
-That sounds like work.
-(Buck chuckles)

39:59.973 --> 40:01.380
Yeah. Yeah, it's work.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.974
But it's how the horses
learn to trust you,

40:03.126 --> 40:05.235
and you learn to trust
the horses.

40:05.386 --> 40:06.794
Can I show him around the place?

40:06.813 --> 40:07.979
Sure.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.797
-I'll be here
if you need me, okay?
-Okay.

40:09.816 --> 40:12.150
-All right.
-Ready?

40:12.244 --> 40:14.318
Let's go meet some horses.

40:14.471 --> 40:18.489
-Have fun.
-Okay, Dad. Thanks.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.417
(speaking quietly)

40:20.568 --> 40:22.326
Equine therapy?

40:22.479 --> 40:24.979
I was doing some research
with Taylor,

40:24.998 --> 40:26.238
and I found this place.

40:26.258 --> 40:27.907
What kind of research?

40:27.926 --> 40:30.318
Well, you were saying
the other day

40:30.487 --> 40:32.487
how random everything seems.

40:32.505 --> 40:34.989
Like, is there, is there
a point to anything?

40:35.082 --> 40:36.749
I remember.

40:36.768 --> 40:42.013
So before you joined the 118,
right, we had this rule.

40:42.165 --> 40:45.942
Don't go past the glass doors.

40:46.093 --> 40:47.835
We bring someone to the ER,

40:47.929 --> 40:49.337
we hand them over,

40:49.355 --> 40:51.948
and that's it-- our job is done.

40:52.099 --> 40:53.841
Never heard that one.

40:53.860 --> 40:57.178
I'm not sure who the first one
to break the rule was.

40:57.197 --> 40:58.846
-Probably me.
-Yeah.

40:58.865 --> 41:02.292
Our job was always just to save
the person in front of us.

41:02.443 --> 41:05.353
Whatever happens next,
well, we...

41:05.446 --> 41:06.796
we aren't supposed to know.

41:06.948 --> 41:10.875
I can see the wisdom
in that philosophy.

41:11.027 --> 41:13.953
It got me thinking...

41:13.972 --> 41:16.556
about the day you got shot.

41:18.626 --> 41:21.886
Well, with everything that
happened, I almost forgot,

41:21.980 --> 41:23.371
that wasn't even our call.

41:23.464 --> 41:26.399
-We were only there
because of...
-Charlie.

41:27.468 --> 41:29.134
It made me wonder
if you ever wished

41:29.154 --> 41:30.561
we hadn't saved him.

41:30.638 --> 41:31.821
-What?
-Come on.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.823
The kid is being poisoned
by his mom.

41:34.050 --> 41:35.900
Probably gonna be
messed up for life.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.903
He almost died.
You don't regret going there?

41:39.055 --> 41:41.906
-No.
-But if it's all just random...

41:42.000 --> 41:43.649
It was still
the right thing to do.

41:43.818 --> 41:46.077
Yeah.

41:46.229 --> 41:49.172
I think so, too.

41:54.346 --> 41:55.586
That's Charlie.

41:55.739 --> 41:58.756
BUCK:
He lives with his aunt
and uncle now.

41:58.908 --> 42:00.591
They seem like really
good people.

42:00.744 --> 42:03.502
They've been bringing him here
for the past few months.

42:03.596 --> 42:06.338
He looks happy.

42:06.432 --> 42:09.751
BUCK:
'Cause he got the help
he needed.

42:09.769 --> 42:12.362
And that started with you.

42:12.589 --> 42:17.700
Whatever happens to him next,
you gave him that second chance.

42:19.020 --> 42:21.162
Maybe that's the point.

42:25.026 --> 42:27.710
Yeah.
(chuckles)

42:27.862 --> 42:29.420
Maybe it is.
