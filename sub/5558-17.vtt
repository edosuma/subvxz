we’ve met five times.

09:50.583 --> 09:52.792
I changed a flat tire
for you once.

You are so funny.

Beginnings Academy.

10:04.709 --> 10:06.083
It’s the best preschool
in the city,

10:06.083 --> 10:07.166

to that sweet little preschool

10:15.417 --> 10:17.000
at the end of our street?

10:17.000 --> 10:18.500
Lower your voice

10:18.500 --> 10:20.583
and raise your standards, okay?

10:20.583 --> 10:21.959
Preschool’s gonna set
the academic tone

10:21.959 --> 10:23.083
for the rest of Lark’s life.

10:23.083 --> 10:24.583

10:24.583 --> 10:26.041
that we hated
who had every advantage?

10:26.041 --> 10:27.250
Don’t we want that for Lark?

10:27.250 --> 10:28.667
Well, yeah,
but I don’t think they make

10:28.667 --> 10:30.834

with Beethoven.

Okay, I don’t think
it’s that impressive.

17:06.458 --> 17:09.000
I mean, it’s, like, the
complete opposite of nuts.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.375
Mm-hm.

17:10.375 --> 17:11.667
So then he got up
on the desk

17:11.667 --> 17:13.125
in front of the whole office

17:13.125 --> 17:14.834
and he told everyone
that he was quitting,

17:14.834 --> 17:15.917
just so we could date.

17:15.917 --> 17:18.250
MIA: Ooh, that gives me chills.

17:18.250 --> 17:20.000
(laughter)

17:20.000 --> 17:21.458
Well, what can I say?

17:21.458 --> 17:23.083
I was in love.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.500
MIA: I love a creative type.

17:25.500 --> 17:29.041
Colleen’s dad is also a painter.

17:29.041 --> 17:31.000
Yeah. He’s a--
well, he’s an artist.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.458
-His name is Miguel.
MATT: Mm-hm.

17:32.458 --> 17:35.083
He was my first love.

17:35.083 --> 17:38.542
I could never truly marry again
after your father.

17:38.542 --> 17:41.125
Well, you’ve married
four times since, so...

17:41.125 --> 17:43.250
Yeah, but not truly.

17:43.250 --> 17:45.333
Mm. I stand corrected.

17:45.333 --> 17:48.417
(laughing)

17:48.417 --> 17:49.625
MIA: No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

17:49.625 --> 17:50.834
Can’t let you take the couch.

17:50.834 --> 17:52.709
COLLEEN: No, it’s fine.
You take my bed.

17:52.709 --> 17:53.709
Unless you’d rather
sleep outside

17:53.709 --> 17:55.750
under the stars
on your bed roll.

17:55.750 --> 17:59.166
You jest,
but it’s exciting

17:59.166 --> 18:01.417
to date different
types of men, dear,

18:01.417 --> 18:04.208
unlike you,
who only have one type of man.

18:04.208 --> 18:07.041
-And what type is that?
-Your father.

18:07.041 --> 18:09.333
-Okay. That’s not true.
MIA: Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

18:09.333 --> 18:12.542
Everyone you fall in love with
is some version of him.

18:12.542 --> 18:14.583
And he’s a passionate dreamer

18:14.583 --> 18:17.375
and he’s impulsive
and he’s sensual...

18:17.375 --> 18:18.583
COLLEEN:
Okay, that’s gross, Mom.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.750
And Matt is nothing like Dad.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.083
Dad walked out on us.

18:22.083 --> 18:25.417
Unlike Matt,
who walked out of a job.

18:25.417 --> 18:27.166
Well, that’s not the same.

18:27.166 --> 18:29.375
So he’s stable?

18:29.375 --> 18:31.000
Never been married before?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.834
Got his own place?

18:32.834 --> 18:34.333
It’s complicated.

18:34.333 --> 18:35.875
It always is.

18:35.875 --> 18:37.250
Baby, baby...

18:37.250 --> 18:38.750
I know this guy.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.208
I married him twice.

18:40.208 --> 18:42.875
It’s very exciting
and it’s wonderful,

18:42.875 --> 18:44.542
because he’s in love with love.

18:44.542 --> 18:46.667
And then one day,
he gets spooked

18:46.667 --> 18:48.125
and he just takes off,

18:48.125 --> 18:51.041
like a mustang
who’s spotted a coyote.
