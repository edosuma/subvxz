And that was
my great-grandmother's.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.398
CLARlSSE/ Something

13:25.538 --> 13:28.974
[Snorts] Yeah, sure.

13:29.041 --> 13:31.305
My father was
the prince of Genovia.

13:31.343 --> 13:33.368
Uh-huh. You're joking.

13:33.445 --> 13:37.848
Why wouId I joke about
something Iike that?

13:37.883 --> 13:41.478
No! Because if he's reaIIy

Shut up?

14:04.376 --> 14:05.638
Your Majesty, in America...

14:05.678 --> 14:07.145
it doesn't aIways mean
''Be quiet.''

14:07.213 --> 14:09.204

''Wow,'' ''Gee whiz,'' ''GoIIy''--

14:09.248 --> 14:11.580
Oh, I understand.
Thank you.

14:11.617 --> 14:15.314

14:19.558 --> 14:23.358
Why wouId you pick me
to be your princess?

Since your father died,
you are the naturaI heir...

14:26.799 --> 14:29.962
to the throne of Genovia.
That's our Iaw.

14:30.002 --> 14:31.833

14:44.250 --> 14:45.945
I never Iead anybody--

14:45.985 --> 14:49.079
not at Brownies,
not at Camp Fire GirIs--

14:49.121 --> 14:52.522
Queen CIarisse,
my expectation in Iife...

14:52.558 --> 14:55.118
is to be invisibIe,
and I'm good at it.

14:55.160 --> 14:58.152
AmeIia, I had
other expectations aIso.

14:58.197 --> 14:59.596
In my wiIdest dreams...

14:59.632 --> 15:01.224
I never expected this
to happen.

his 15 minutes of fame.

your criticism.

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:50.576
You're saying that as a queen,
I was too harsh on her.

But about what, hmm?

01:21:10.666 --> 01:21:12.293
How you broke
my brother's heart...

01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:14.427
or how you stuck me
with Jeremiah...

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:15.835
during my cabIe show doing...

01:21:15.904 --> 01:21:18.168
''Pick a card, pick a card.''
Mwah mwah mwah!

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.400
I'm sorry, OK?

01:21:19.475 --> 01:21:20.669
I forgot to caII you

01:21:20.743 --> 01:21:21.767
that I couIdn't make it.

01:21:21.844 --> 01:21:24.108
So I was stuck with
the Happy Houdini...

01:21:24.146 --> 01:21:26.478
whiIe you make out
with the Yachting Yahoo.

01:21:26.515 --> 01:21:28.346
Those are reaIIy

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:33.349

and I'm just reaIIy sorry.

01:21:38.994 --> 01:21:42.691
LILL Y: I can't beIieve
that you hung me up...

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:44.460
after aII I did for you.

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:46.730
I kept your royaI secret.

01:21:46.769 --> 01:21:48.361
And do you know
how hard it is...

01:21:48.437 --> 01:21:50.268
to have a cabIe show
and keep a secret?

01:21:50.339 --> 01:21:51.863
You didn't keep it
a secret from me...

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:54.170
how jerky you thought
my being a princess was.

01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:56.109
WeII, congratuIations.
You got your wish.

01:21:56.145 --> 01:21:57.703
I'm not gonna be a princess.

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:58.940
You're not?

01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:00.346
No.

01:22:00.382 --> 01:22:03.749
But I want you to be.

01:22:03.786 --> 01:22:05.720
What?

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:07.585
[Sighs]

01:22:07.623 --> 01:22:09.147
I didn't mean it.

01:22:09.191 --> 01:22:11.751
The green monster
of jeaIousy came out...

01:22:11.794 --> 01:22:13.989
because you were Miss PopuIar...

01:22:14.029 --> 01:22:15.997
and l thought l was
losing my best friend...

01:22:16.031 --> 01:22:19.933
so I got angry and upset
and hurt and...

01:22:19.968 --> 01:22:21.458
I toId you!

01:22:21.537 --> 01:22:23.528
I need an attitude adjustment.

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:26.438
But the truth is...

01:22:26.475 --> 01:22:30.275
you being a princess
is kind of a miracIe.

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:31.939
Whoa! No!

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:33.811
What miracIe?

01:22:33.849 --> 01:22:36.010
It's a nightmare!

01:22:36.051 --> 01:22:38.246
No! Think about it!

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:40.187
I just found out
that my cabIe show...

01:22:40.222 --> 01:22:41.814
onIy reaches 12 peopIe.

01:22:41.857 --> 01:22:46.419
Wanting to rock the world,
but having zip power like me--

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:48.123
now, that's a nightmare.

01:22:48.163 --> 01:22:50.427
But you--Wow!

01:22:50.466 --> 01:22:52.434

01:22:57.339 --> 01:23:00.206
Wow is having the power

01:23:01.543 --> 01:23:03.704
How many teenagers
have that power?

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:05.542
What more of a miracIe
do you want?

01:23:05.581 --> 01:23:07.014
WeII...

01:23:07.049 --> 01:23:10.883
we'II just have to find
a different miracIe.

01:23:10.919 --> 01:23:14.184
Not more, just different.

Mia, it's not
a championship game.

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:06.799
It's not even a big game.
It's just gym cIass.

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.069
Just hit the baII.

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:10.111

It was found
among his possessions.

01:29:34.169 --> 01:29:37.297
My birthday's not for two weeks.

01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:38.566
CLARlSSE/ l know...

01:30:07.836 --> 01:30:09.497
That's aII right, Grandma.

01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:12.802
I've been thinking about it
a great deaI...

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:13.966
and the truth is...

01:30:14.042 --> 01:30:17.341
I think you'd make
a very fine princess.

01:30:17.379 --> 01:30:19.040
You know, people think...

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.139

to wear tiaras...

01:30:21.182 --> 01:30:23.241

than that.

01:30:27.889 --> 01:30:30.289
It's a reaI job.

01:30:34.296 --> 01:30:38.960
You are an extraordinary person,
Grandma...

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.696
but I don't think
I'm meant to do this.

01:30:41.770 --> 01:30:45.399
I wouId be so afraid...

01:30:45.473 --> 01:30:49.239

the peopIe of Genovia...

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:51.006

to disappoint you again.
