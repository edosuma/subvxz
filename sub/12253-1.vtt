WEBVTT

00:20.280 --> 00:21.430
Caspar, what are you doing?

00:21.520 --> 00:24.558
Training for the Winter Olympics.
What are you doing?

00:24.640 --> 00:26.757
Well, whilst you've been training
for the Winter Olympics,

00:26.840 --> 00:29.355
- I've come up with an idea. Look.
- Whoa!

00:29.440 --> 00:31.591
- That's a lot of words for you, Joe.
- Yeah, I know.

00:31.680 --> 00:32.909
What do they mean?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.514
So, you know
how you've never had a job?

00:34.600 --> 00:36.034
Like a proper, proper job?

00:36.880 --> 00:38.394
Stop rubbing that in.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.950
So I thought, right,
how about we go on a road trip

00:41.040 --> 00:44.750
for a week,
no YouTube, no phones and no money?

00:44.840 --> 00:47.071
We've just got to
work our way around Europe.

00:47.160 --> 00:48.435
What do you reckon?

00:48.640 --> 00:50.632
I think I'd be a lot better at that
than you would.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.279
Well, you carry on thinking that

00:52.360 --> 00:54.920
and whilst you're thinking about that,
can you please take the rubbish out?

00:55.000 --> 00:58.038
'Cause it's been here for about a week
and it stinks.

01:03.440 --> 01:04.476
Oh!

01:06.440 --> 01:08.238
- Uh, Joe...
- Yep?

01:08.360 --> 01:09.714
I've got a problem.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.757
I think everyone knows
you've got a problem, Caspar.

01:11.840 --> 01:15.390
- What is it?
- There's a massive ledge here.

01:16.280 --> 01:18.636
You are useless.

01:18.720 --> 01:21.554
This is going to be
an absolute disaster.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.472
Hold on. I think I need a run-up.

01:39.440 --> 01:41.875
Hello, or should I say <i>buongiorno!</i>

01:41.960 --> 01:44.236
Because we're in Venice, Italy.

01:44.560 --> 01:47.632
Oh, and we're in a camper van, right?

01:47.720 --> 01:49.552
But it's not just any old camper van.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.280
It's a Volkswagen Transporter T2.

01:52.360 --> 01:55.478
Joe, you're not Jeremy Clarkson
and this isn't <i>Top Gear.</i>

01:55.560 --> 01:57.153
Okay.

01:57.240 --> 01:59.630
Tell them where
we really got the camper van from.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.030
Okay, we borrowed it off
Oli White's parents.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.112
No, you did not borrow it, you stole it.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.590
What is the definition of stealing?

02:06.680 --> 02:09.673
You got the keys from my house
and just drove off.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.800
Joe! Joe!

02:13.880 --> 02:15.599
I went through a green light,
why are you shouting at me?

02:15.680 --> 02:18.149
Why is Joe driving?
He can't even reach the pedals.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.876
I think we're about five minutes
away from a little café

02:25.960 --> 02:28.236
where we're going to meet Greta,
who's an Italian YouTuber.

02:28.320 --> 02:30.471
- Is she nice? What?
- Oli!

02:30.560 --> 02:31.560
- Look at him.
- She's your type!

02:31.640 --> 02:32.640
Really?

02:32.760 --> 02:34.194
Oli! Hey! Hey!

02:34.280 --> 02:35.555
Hold on, let's stop here.

02:35.640 --> 02:38.439
There's an ice cream place,
how about I go get four ice creams?

02:38.600 --> 02:39.600
Yes, please.

02:39.680 --> 02:40.830
Come on,
that's a nice little present.

02:40.920 --> 02:41.990
- Chocolate?
- Yeah, chocolate.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.037
I'm having chocolate as well, right.
Four chocolates.

02:44.480 --> 02:45.880
Two scoops, please, Oli.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.633
Wait there, I'll be two minutes.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.110
- 30 minutes.
- An hour.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.429
Yeah.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.398
Oh!

02:56.480 --> 02:58.312
I was kind of looking
forward to an ice cream

02:58.400 --> 03:00.153
but this is way better.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.156
Guys?

03:07.160 --> 03:08.196
Caspar?

03:08.960 --> 03:09.960
Joe?

03:12.360 --> 03:15.080
- This must be it here on our right.
- Oh, yeah, it must be it.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.640
- It must be.
- Wait, wait, wait.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.832
- Oh, I can see Greta.
- Yay!

03:18.920 --> 03:20.798
Yes, we found it,
we found it, we found it.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.952
- Greta!
- Oh, hi!

03:24.040 --> 03:27.351
- Good to see you. Joe.
- Hey, nice to meet you.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.874
- Three kisses?
- Yeah.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.229
Oh, pizza.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.834
So, we're in Venice, and...

03:31.920 --> 03:34.754
Is there any jobs going round here
that'd be interesting to do?

03:34.840 --> 03:37.230
Well, uh, Venice
is a very romantic city.

03:37.640 --> 03:41.236
I've been thinking,
maybe you should be gondoliers.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.312
- Like the, the boats?
- Yeah, what do you think?

03:43.400 --> 03:44.470
Does sound quite cool.

03:44.560 --> 03:47.553
But first, I think you should
take lessons, you know?

03:47.640 --> 03:49.438
And I have a friend of mine that...

03:49.520 --> 03:52.399
She teaches people
how to become a gondolier.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.758
We definitely, definitely, definitely
need lessons in something like that.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.240
- Let's do it. Sweet.
- Come with me.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.394
- Hi!
- Hi, Greta.

04:05.480 --> 04:07.039
So this is my friend, Julia.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.077
- Hi, Julia. I'm fine.
- How are you?

04:09.320 --> 04:10.720
- So, this is Joe.
- Hi Julia, Joe. Nice to meet you.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.120
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Julia.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.680
- This is Caspar.
- I'm Caspar.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.114
I'm Julia.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.428
Nice to meet you, Julia.

04:16.519 --> 04:18.432
She'll teach you
how to become a gondolier.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.714
- Oh, wow!
- Nice!

04:19.800 --> 04:21.519
Um, I don't know if Greta told you

04:21.600 --> 04:23.831
but we trying to make
some money really quickly

04:23.920 --> 04:25.639
and I heard gondoliers make a lot.

04:25.720 --> 04:28.076
Uh, yes, quite a lot, yeah.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.719
Good. How long do you think
that it will take for us

04:29.800 --> 04:32.156
to be really good enough
to do this professionally?

04:32.240 --> 04:34.277
Well, to be good, three or four months.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.670
To be really good,
maybe a little bit more.

04:37.080 --> 04:39.914
We do not have...
We've only got a few hours to learn.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.471
Uh, it's okay, we can try
and then we will see.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.756
I can see you have an eye for talent.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.910
Look, I know we're not meant
to mix business with pleasure

04:49.000 --> 04:50.798
but she's gorgeous.
Please wingman me on this?

04:50.880 --> 04:51.950
Well, you wingman me.

04:52.040 --> 04:54.191
No, she was looking at me.

04:54.880 --> 04:55.996
I got this.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.356
You know, just stand up
a little bit more.

04:58.440 --> 04:59.715
I'm just quite tall.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.520
- I'm a lot taller than Joe.
- See, you can make this shorter.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.034
It's like watching a baby learn to walk.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.790
I bet your boyfriend
wouldn't be this bad, Julia.

05:07.880 --> 05:10.156
Uh, ahem, I don't know
because I don't have one any more.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.240
What?

05:11.320 --> 05:14.950
I think it was pretty obvious that, um,
we were flirting with Julia.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.680
- What's your favourite colour?
- Uh, light blue.

05:17.760 --> 05:18.760
- Aw!
- Mmm-hmm.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.797
Same colour as my eyes.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.873
But she was only laughing at my jokes.

05:23.960 --> 05:27.158
Caspar was useless, absolutely useless
but... Everything he does.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.914
Sometimes I think he's just not human.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.310
Like, he's just not... I don't know,
I think he's, like, he wasn't even born.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.834
He was just...
Came out of a hole in the ground.

05:33.920 --> 05:36.674
- Make the oar shorter.
- But then it's going to hit the side.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.513
Julia was actually
quite impressed, I think.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.671
- Wait, wait. Wait! Wait!
- No, that's not right.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.912
- We're going to, we're going to...
- Not too much.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.356
Just calm down,
you're going to snap the oar.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.591
Typical Caspar, you know,
he tries so hard.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.114
He's trying too hard to impress her.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.271
I know if I don't make the first move
and ask her out tonight,

05:52.360 --> 05:54.556
he definitely will.
I know what he's like.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.438
Caspar, look at me, Caspar.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.910
Caspar! Caspar, look at me.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.632
Caspar! Caspar!

06:01.720 --> 06:04.838
He has a very good balance,
so this is good.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.150
It doesn't seem
that it is his first time.

06:09.640 --> 06:12.439
- So I think you are ready to work.
- See that, Caspar?

06:12.720 --> 06:13.915
What about me?

06:14.920 --> 06:16.036
Ah...

06:16.120 --> 06:17.520
There's absolutely no chance

06:17.600 --> 06:19.717
that Joe's going to take Julia
out for dinner tonight.

06:20.360 --> 06:23.034
But if he does,
there will be hell to pay.

06:23.240 --> 06:26.278
Did he actually say that?

06:26.360 --> 06:29.239
No, 8 p.m. tonight.
Couldn't believe it.

06:31.720 --> 06:32.949
Ooh!

06:33.240 --> 06:34.560
Look at the hat.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.359
<i>- Buongiorno!</i>
- Hello!

06:36.440 --> 06:38.079
- Hello, oh...
- I'm Bernardo.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.231
- Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.277
- This is my boat.
- Awesome.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.670
- That's very nice.
- Thank you for letting us use it.

06:44.760 --> 06:45.955
Yeah, no problem.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.600
How do we get people
to actually get in the boat?

06:48.680 --> 06:51.991
Oh, see, you're only say,
"Gondola! Gondola!

06:52.080 --> 06:53.673
"Eighty euros, Gondola!"

06:53.760 --> 06:55.274
- Okay, I think we got that.
- I think we got that.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.750
I think we can do that,
thank you very much again.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.035
- Okay, you're welcome.
- Thank you. Cheers.

06:59.120 --> 07:02.079
- Gondola! Gondola!
- Gondola!

07:02.200 --> 07:04.999
- How much for the gondola ride?
- Uh, 80 euros.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.993
Gondola! Gondola!

07:08.080 --> 07:10.436
'Cause you have such a nice watch,
it's going to cost 80 euros.

07:10.520 --> 07:11.636
Ooh! Ah...

07:11.720 --> 07:13.074
Gondola!

07:13.160 --> 07:15.595
Yes, you in the window, gondola!

07:15.840 --> 07:17.957
Your accent, it doesn't sound Italy.

07:18.040 --> 07:19.633
I get that a lot.

07:19.720 --> 07:23.999
But I've been
in Italy for five years now, so get in.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.399
Yes, 80 euros, 40 minutes.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.035
Jesus!

07:36.120 --> 07:37.600
Gondola!

07:38.400 --> 07:41.040
I must just warn you,
I've a bit of a bad back today.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.600
So we're not going to be going too far.

07:42.680 --> 07:46.230
But luckily,
we're right next to Hogwarts!

07:46.320 --> 07:48.880
That's what the Hogwarts
was based on in Harry Potter.

07:48.960 --> 07:53.079
Venice, believe it or not, was actually
named after Venice Beach

07:53.160 --> 07:54.958
- in LA, California. Do you know?
- Yeah. Yeah.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.635
Yeah, a lot of people don't actually
know that but that's a fact.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.996
Do you think the, um,
tide is going that way?

08:00.080 --> 08:02.800
- Yeah, yeah definitely.
- Okay, let's go that way.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.235
Okay, but...

08:04.320 --> 08:05.720
That's easier.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.393
If you look really closely
on to this bridge

08:07.480 --> 08:10.871
you can see a very famous, uh,
signature, autograph.

08:10.960 --> 08:12.553
- Yeah.
- Etched into the stone. Do you see it?

08:12.640 --> 08:13.676
Yeah. Yeah.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.480
- Can you guess who's it is?
- Eh, no.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.040
It's Leonardo Di Caprio's.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.520
- See it?
- Wow!

08:19.600 --> 08:21.717
I can't really concentrate
while you talk, sorry.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.439
I know that's rude. I'm just really,

08:23.520 --> 08:25.989
really concentrating
and I got the bad back as I...

08:26.080 --> 08:28.470
- You're style?
- Did I tell you I have a bad back?

08:28.560 --> 08:29.676
<i>Ciao.</i>

08:29.760 --> 08:31.353
<i>- Ciao.
- Ciao.</i>

08:31.440 --> 08:32.590
Fun fact for you guys.

08:32.679 --> 08:36.390
My very first customer was
Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.240
So I've really gone downhill
since then, haven't I?

08:41.799 --> 08:45.237
You're lucky because I've actually been
nominated as Gondolier of the Year.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.436
- Oh, really?
- Yeah!

08:46.520 --> 08:47.670
That's coming up in a few weeks' time.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.877
So I'm just getting some extra
practice in.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.874
Did you hear about the whale

08:51.960 --> 08:54.395
- that swam up the canal from the sea?
- Yeah.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.153
And he actually came around here,
passed underneath this bridge.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.240
- Hmm.
- Ah, okay.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.471
That's why I always do whale song.
A lot of people don't know about that.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.472
- Take 100.
- Thank you very much, you want change?

09:01.560 --> 09:03.392
- No, it's all right.
- You sure?

09:09.080 --> 09:11.754
I'll give you 20 more
because it was wonderful.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.752
- Oh, thank you so much, thank you.
- Okay.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.396
- Okay. Please keep the change.
- Thank you very much.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.392
- Thank you, thank you so much!
- You can keep the change.

09:18.480 --> 09:19.550
Oh, shit!

09:21.440 --> 09:22.760
Oh, God!

09:25.600 --> 09:27.831
Stop, I want to... I want to step off.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.479
- Please stop.
- You want to stop?

09:29.560 --> 09:30.994
- Please?
- Yeah.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.400
Oh, my!

09:37.720 --> 09:40.155
Caspar!

09:41.680 --> 09:42.716
Shit!

09:42.800 --> 09:44.757
Caspar, don't swallow!

09:44.880 --> 09:46.758
- Caspar, are you listening?
- Oh, my God.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.240
- Shut up, Joe!
- Make sure you spit.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.720
Don't, don't swallow the water.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.474
- I think I swallowed.
- Don't swallow, always spit.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.678
Grab this oar. Grab this.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.638
You bloody wally. Grab it.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.232
Wait, wait get your hat first.
Get your hat first.

09:59.320 --> 10:00.356
No!

10:00.440 --> 10:01.999
- You have to! You can't...
- Oh, buddy!

10:02.080 --> 10:03.878
Julia gave that to us.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.715
There's an undercurrent!
There's an undercurrent!

10:07.880 --> 10:10.315
You're all right, just grow up.
You big baby!

10:11.200 --> 10:12.429
Caspar.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.557
- Your oar as well. You have to.
- No.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.718
- Oh, Joe!
- Julia's going to be so annoyed with us.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.512
I'm so sorry about this, guys.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.956
- I've got you, buddy. I've got you.
- No...

10:23.040 --> 10:24.952
- I got you!
- You're going to scrape me!

10:25.040 --> 10:26.759
I'm not. Give me your hand.

10:30.240 --> 10:35.076
I was so inspired by Julia's words. She
said I'd improved but I didn't at all.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.072
I got really... Actually, I got worse.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.080
I just wanted to put everything into it

10:39.160 --> 10:41.800
<i>and I kind of went too far in
with the rod</i>

10:42.560 --> 10:45.632
<i>and I guess I couldn't carry
the weight of the water</i>

10:45.720 --> 10:47.234
<i>that I had pulled with the rod</i>

10:47.600 --> 10:48.795
<i>and I fell in.</i>

10:48.880 --> 10:50.792
150, 200...

10:50.880 --> 10:54.874
20, 40, 60, 80... 300 in the end!

10:54.960 --> 10:56.553
That's 60 in tips!

10:56.640 --> 10:58.836
Before, I was going to take her
somewhere pretty basic,

10:58.920 --> 11:00.240
you know, don't know where I am, anyway.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.994
But now I can take her
to the finest place, probably.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.434
I don't know
what Caspar's going to do tonight

11:04.520 --> 11:06.989
but I think, uh,
I left some crisps in the camper van.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.639
So I'm sure he'll find them.

11:09.280 --> 11:10.316
So you've probably guessed by now

11:10.400 --> 11:12.039
that we're not using
our vlogging cameras to make this.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.316
Uh, we do indeed have an actual crew.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.199
Pan around, Caspar. Show them the crew.

11:16.280 --> 11:18.033
- Hello, everyone! Hi!
- Here they are.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.555
Who have worked on amazing stuff,
including <i>Top Gear.</i>

11:20.640 --> 11:23.109
Oh, wait, this is kind of...
It's getting a little bit heavy.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.395
Try and do a zoom in.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.880
- I'll have my camera back now.
- Sorry.

11:25.960 --> 11:28.395
- You're no good at it at all.
- Yeah, that's probably not a good idea.

11:29.960 --> 11:32.156
Joe, I do want you know
how much I appreciate you

11:32.240 --> 11:33.959
using some of
your money to pay for this taxi.

11:34.040 --> 11:37.590
This is really beautiful,
thank you so much for being so generous.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.160
Oh, wait, Caspar,
that's St Mark's Square.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.560
That's where we're going
to meet her tonight.

11:40.640 --> 11:42.120
- Who?
- Huh?

11:42.200 --> 11:43.520
Who are you meeting there tonight?

11:43.600 --> 11:45.000
I said, "That's where
we're going to be eating tonight."

11:45.080 --> 11:46.719
No, you said, "That's where I'm going to
meet her tonight."

11:46.800 --> 11:47.836
I said "eating".

11:58.440 --> 12:01.114
- Chip?
- No thanks, man. I'm full.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.873
But you love these chips.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.872
Yeah, I know, but I've just had
a full-on meal, haven't I?

12:04.960 --> 12:08.397
- I'm stuffed.
- Wait, I thought you were on the toilet.

12:08.480 --> 12:09.709
What, for three hours?

12:09.800 --> 12:12.269
Don't be stupid. I was having a meal,
wasn't I, with Julia?

12:12.360 --> 12:14.795
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did. Oh, and it was great!

12:14.880 --> 12:16.633
I even had tiramisu,
I don't really have that.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.076
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.310
I didn't even like it that much

12:20.400 --> 12:21.550
but I thought
I'd have it in your honour.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.233
Shut up!

12:24.440 --> 12:26.113
All right, Caspar,
we're getting low on fuel.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.157
So keep an eye out
for a petrol station, all right?

12:28.240 --> 12:30.277
Do they look the same here
as they do in England?

12:30.360 --> 12:32.829
I hope so, yeah.
Otherwise we're in a lot of trouble.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.435
I must warn you
that I've never done this before.

12:35.520 --> 12:37.637
Well, this one has four pumps. Oh, God.

12:37.720 --> 12:38.720
Oh, no!

12:39.200 --> 12:40.873
Turn the lights off.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.989
- I don't think it's going to reach it.
- Joe, it's, uh...

12:45.080 --> 12:47.515
Just pull it, you blooming idiot.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.600
Hold on.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.353
Don't put the money on the floor,
it's going to blow away!

12:50.440 --> 12:51.840
Look, put your foot on it.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.559
Caspar, it's going to blow away.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.393
- I've got my foot on it.
- Good.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.473
Joe, come out here and help.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.359
Oh, my...

13:01.880 --> 13:03.280
You know what you are?

13:04.520 --> 13:06.512
Wait, keep your foot on the money.

13:06.600 --> 13:07.954
What money? Oh!

13:08.040 --> 13:09.793
Yes, there we go...

13:10.480 --> 13:12.199
Yeah, it wasn't that easy, was it, huh?

13:12.280 --> 13:14.078
Are you using the right key? Oh, yes.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.600
There we go. Now it's stuck.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.478
Now it's locked, see.
Unlock it like this.

13:17.560 --> 13:18.710
Pull it.

13:19.040 --> 13:22.192
You twist, I'll pull.
Should we get someone to help us?

13:27.720 --> 13:30.155
We had to get the cameraman,
let me film him.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.516
Ah, film it, film it.
Don't drop the camera.

13:32.720 --> 13:35.235
Come on, boys.
How bloody hard is it?

13:35.440 --> 13:37.272
So the cameraman
is currently, uh...

13:37.360 --> 13:40.637
- Phil can't do it, oh, Phil's done it.
- No way!

13:40.760 --> 13:42.080
Do you want me to help you with this?

13:42.160 --> 13:43.514
I got it. Forty euros, right?

13:43.600 --> 13:44.750
- Go for it.
- I'm just going to go.

13:44.840 --> 13:48.311
But make sure
you don't go over, over 40.

13:48.480 --> 13:49.800
It's on one.

13:49.880 --> 13:53.351
For every cent you go over, I get
to punch you in arm as hard as I can.

13:53.480 --> 13:55.472
- Keep going. Yeah, all right.
- Yeah, it's on six.

13:55.560 --> 13:59.156
- You can for it, a little bit.
- Seven, eight, nine, ten.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.798
Oh, shit! I think it's full!

14:04.880 --> 14:06.837
All right, okay, grab the money
before someone else takes it.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.073
You can do it, I'm proud of you.

14:10.840 --> 14:12.559
I did it!

14:14.440 --> 14:16.716
Well done. Right. On to Verona!

14:16.800 --> 14:18.553
Verona!

14:18.640 --> 14:20.279
Where... Where am I going?
Where am I going?

14:24.200 --> 14:26.317
I'm so tired, Caspar,
we need to pull over.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.392
Uh, then, just pull over.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.117
I'm going to pull over
just here, all right?

14:32.200 --> 14:35.272
- You sure it's safe?
- Yeah, it'll be fine.

14:46.560 --> 14:49.359
We're in the middle of
a freaking roundabout, you dickhead!

15:03.480 --> 15:06.154
- Look at this.
- That's great.

15:06.320 --> 15:09.279
As funny as that is, it wasn't funny
what happened this morning.

15:09.360 --> 15:12.717
And from now on, I'm going to be the one
who decides where we park.

15:12.840 --> 15:15.435
- All right, fair enough.
- Thank you.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.558
Anyway, in terms of work,
um, before we left Venice,

15:18.640 --> 15:21.200
I spoke to Greta and she said that
there's someone in Verona

15:21.280 --> 15:23.237
who can potentially sort us out
with a job for today.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.320
Great.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.914
But you know, I don't know
if it's your thing, it's...

15:26.000 --> 15:28.356
I'm not too keen on it
but it's up to you,

15:28.440 --> 15:30.238
it's just making pizza, so...

15:30.320 --> 15:31.879
Oh yeah, you like pizza, don't you?

15:31.960 --> 15:33.314
- I forgot.
- Joe! Thank you.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.198
Yeah, you really like pizza,
this is your thing, then.

15:35.280 --> 15:37.590
Finally, I can thrive at something.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.240
That job doesn't start till 11:00,
so we've got loads of time to kill.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.551
Apparently, the balcony
from <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> is down there.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.758
- So if you're up for that, follow me.
- What?

15:46.520 --> 15:49.911
Joe, I just picked this magnet up
and you just...

15:56.920 --> 15:58.513
Oh, wow, that must be it.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.069
- The balcony from <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>
- Oh, yeah, look.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.959
The letter things, you're meant to
write a love letter to someone

16:05.040 --> 16:07.077
and you can put them in the cracks.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.876
- Hey!
- Hey!

16:23.960 --> 16:25.189
Wait, hold on, listen to this.

16:25.840 --> 16:28.958
Her vestal livery is but green
and none but fools do wear it,

16:29.040 --> 16:30.440
- cast it off!
- I can't hear you, mate.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.671
Oh, it is my lady. Oh, it is my love.

16:32.760 --> 16:34.160
Oh, that she knew she were!

16:34.280 --> 16:36.556
- Can't hear you.
- She speaks, but she says nothing.

16:36.640 --> 16:38.632
I bet Julia would love
to see you up there, Joe.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.077
- What do you mean?
- I read your letter.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.640
- You read my letter?
- Yeah.

16:42.720 --> 16:45.110
- You're not allowed to read my letter.
- Oh, so you can hear me now,

16:45.200 --> 16:46.600
but you couldn't hear me earlier?

16:46.680 --> 16:48.433
Well, yeah, I can hear you
now you're talking about Julia.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.955
I thought I was your one true love.

16:52.080 --> 16:54.515
Oh, well, would you just
look at that, Caspar?

16:54.600 --> 16:55.829
- Beautiful.
- It is, isn't it?

16:55.920 --> 16:58.674
I know a very interesting
historical fact about this Colosseum.

16:58.760 --> 17:00.991
- What's that?
- One Direction played there once.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.998
- Really?
- Yeah. Lucky Colosseum, huh?

17:03.080 --> 17:05.675
Yeah. Anyway, I think this restaurant
we're supposed to be working at

17:05.760 --> 17:07.079
is just over here, so...

17:07.160 --> 17:08.878
Let's go check it out.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.515
Oh, wow, look at it.

17:13.520 --> 17:14.920
- Hi, Joe and Caspar.
- Good morning.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.593
We're looking for a guy named Jack.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.034
Ah, okay. Jack.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.510
- Hey. Joe and Caspar.
- Hi guys, nice to meet you.

17:20.599 --> 17:22.272
- Joe. Greta sent us to meet you.
- Yeah, sure.

17:22.359 --> 17:23.714
- I was expecting you, come on over.
- Brilliant.

17:24.319 --> 17:25.720
- You ready for this?
- I was made for this.

17:25.800 --> 17:26.800
Let's do it.

17:27.359 --> 17:29.158
Although it kind of looks like
I'm wearing a skirt.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.152
Some people want to meet Barack Obama,

17:31.240 --> 17:32.560
others want to meet Harry Styles.

17:32.640 --> 17:35.155
Hey, guys, this is Marcello,
he is our best pizza maker.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.240
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

17:36.320 --> 17:38.551
I've always wanted to meet
Marcello de Marco,

17:38.680 --> 17:40.353
from the oldest pizzeria in Verona.

17:40.440 --> 17:41.715
Oh, my God, you're my hero.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.953
- Calm down, Caspar.
- Okay, so, we just have

17:45.040 --> 17:46.679
- to watch him and...
- Yeah, just watch his hands,

17:46.760 --> 17:48.513
- see what he does.
- Oh, wow!

17:48.600 --> 17:50.592
- Just slapping it about.
- He's so quick with that.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.838
Tomato first, Joe.
Look how he does that.

17:52.920 --> 17:54.639
I can... Yeah, I love
the symmetricalness of this.

17:54.720 --> 17:55.720
Love the spiral.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.680
Oh, wow!

17:58.800 --> 18:00.837
The way you put that cheese on
was very professional.

18:00.920 --> 18:03.389
You're like the Michael Phelps of pizza.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.153
- I like some salami, please.
- Yes, salami.

18:05.240 --> 18:07.072
Little bit of greens. Make it healthy.

18:07.160 --> 18:10.073
Yeah. And the mozzarella balls
here are amazing.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.072
- The way he places it.
- I know, I'm very proud of him.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.514
It's almost like
he knows he's being filmed.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.592
- Oh, olives.
- Oh, no.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.200
Would you put ham on there, too?

18:17.280 --> 18:19.556
Bit too much? Yeah, you're the expert.

18:19.680 --> 18:20.830
I just want to see
how he tears it up.

18:20.920 --> 18:21.920
- Oh, it's perfect.
- Oh, wow.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.070
Perfect tearing.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.392
Sorry.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.516
Get out the way, Joe.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.398
It's like one of those things
you have in the swimming pool.

18:29.480 --> 18:30.960
To get the crap
out of the swimming pool.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.480
Don't try and keep up with him,
he's an expert, all right?

18:33.560 --> 18:35.756
- Just take your time.
- Yeah. I know what I'm doing.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.275
You've got to show it who's boss.
See, look, he's showing it who's boss.

18:38.560 --> 18:39.560
He's not messing around.

18:39.640 --> 18:40.835
He's like a flat-pizza man,
look at him.

18:40.960 --> 18:43.634
Now, Marcello, don't show off, now.

18:43.720 --> 18:46.076
Oh, Marcello, you crazy!

18:46.720 --> 18:48.598
- What are you putting on, Caspar?
- I'm putting on some salami.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.158
Just make sure it looks
symmetricaland neat

18:51.240 --> 18:52.390
because we need to earn some money here.

18:52.480 --> 18:53.960
- Yeah, buddy.
- Symmetrical.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.269
Don't want too many olives.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.158
Double cheese.
Everyone likes cheese.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.558
It's going to be a doughy old base.

19:05.680 --> 19:06.909
Now we wait.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.719
Use those little thatcher hands.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.110
My little chipolata sausage fingers.

19:11.240 --> 19:12.799
I'm going to do you proud, Caspar.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.634
Trying to go as fast as Marcello
but he's too quick.

19:16.840 --> 19:18.559
You're pretty fast.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.034
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.709
- Oh.
- It looks like a sad ghost, doesn't it?

19:26.360 --> 19:28.636
- Oh, Caspar.
- Whoa!

19:29.680 --> 19:31.751
- It's hot. Look at it.
- Look at that.

19:31.840 --> 19:32.956
That looks so good.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.633
That's got
a little style on that.

19:39.320 --> 19:41.312
Fantastic

19:41.840 --> 19:42.840
Buddy...

19:42.960 --> 19:46.795
All right, Caspar, you're booked here.
We want you for the afternoon. Good job.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.394
My man, yeah!

19:48.480 --> 19:50.756
Thank you, Marcello. <i>Gracias.</i>

19:50.840 --> 19:52.433
Everyone loves cheese.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.671
- Everyone loves salami.
- Ooh.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.991
I don't know what the hell this is
but it's going on.

19:57.080 --> 20:00.118
He has no idea what he's doing.
He's not a natural like me, is he?

20:00.200 --> 20:03.238
It's good, everyone wants everything on.
Where are those, like, big tomatoes?

20:03.880 --> 20:05.075
Will that work?

20:05.160 --> 20:08.358
Caspar's pizza was really good.
I was really impressed with his pizza.

20:08.440 --> 20:11.035
So I thought, "You know what, Joe,
you're going to have to take a gamble."

20:11.400 --> 20:13.232
Wow, Joe, that is very creative.

20:13.320 --> 20:15.232
Sometimes you just got to think
outside the box. You know what I mean?

20:15.320 --> 20:16.834
I wanted to make a tomato
version of Vesuvius,

20:16.920 --> 20:18.240
so you cut into the tomato

20:18.320 --> 20:21.791
and this liquid hot tomato juice
sprays out.

20:22.120 --> 20:23.952
Which, thinking about it now,
is a bit dangerous.

20:24.440 --> 20:25.874
Watch out, Caspar.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.155
Marcello.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.280
No, no.

20:43.240 --> 20:46.711
You're going to work in the kitchen
washing dishes. Sorry.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.439
Welcome to the pizzeria.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.354
Thank you. Joe, leave.

20:52.480 --> 20:53.994
Well, I can still make money
from washing up, right?

20:54.080 --> 20:55.230
Yes, you can.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.470
<i>I think Joe
had a lot of potential</i>

20:56.560 --> 20:57.560
<i>but he kind of went over the top.</i>

20:57.640 --> 20:59.836
When he saw how well I was doing,
he wanted to one-up me

20:59.920 --> 21:01.559
by being a bit too creative.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.394
And that can really hurt you with pizza,
because you gotta just stick

21:04.480 --> 21:06.790
to what you know
and, yeah, he went wrong.

21:14.920 --> 21:16.832
<i>Hate touching food,
when it's in water in a sink.</i>

21:16.920 --> 21:18.036
Hate it, makes me gag.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.393
<i>I would feel sorry for Joe.</i>

21:21.480 --> 21:24.871
He had to spend whole afternoon
washing up for half the pay I got.

21:26.480 --> 21:30.474
But yesterday, I was swimming in shit.
And then there's Julia.

21:30.560 --> 21:32.438
So, no, I don't feel sorry at all.

21:39.920 --> 21:43.197
So, she told the doctor,
"No, I don't need your help."

21:44.560 --> 21:46.552
Oh, Jack, how many pizzas
did you think I made today?

21:46.640 --> 21:48.632
- Well, maybe 20, 30, I don't know.
- Wow.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.832
Joe, how many plates did you wash?

21:50.920 --> 21:52.673
Too many, stop making such great pizzas.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.552
Anyway, Jack, is there any other jobs
that we can do today,

21:55.640 --> 21:56.640
before the day's over?

21:56.720 --> 21:57.836
We've got a long drive
ahead of us, to Milan.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.037
Actually, yeah, there is something
we do here in the restaurant.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.032
But you need special training.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.077
- Are you guys up for it?
- Yeah, definitely.

22:04.160 --> 22:05.230
- Yeah.
- Excellent.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.834
- Wow.
- Thank you.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.151
Um, well, my boy Jack from downstairs...

22:26.240 --> 22:27.240
Yeah.

22:27.320 --> 22:30.996
...uh, hooked us up with you
but we're not quite sure why.

22:31.080 --> 22:32.833
I'm Anastasia. I'm an opera singer

22:32.920 --> 22:38.120
and I'm here for teaching you
to be a singing waiter.

22:38.320 --> 22:40.073
- Wow!
- Oh!

22:40.160 --> 22:42.231
- That makes a lot of sense.
- Are you able to sing?

22:42.440 --> 22:43.794
- Um...
- Not very well.

22:43.920 --> 22:46.116
Not really. Okay, guys, who's the first?

22:46.200 --> 22:47.200
Oh, like, right now?

22:47.280 --> 22:48.839
Yeah, right now, I mean...
What are you waiting for?

22:48.920 --> 22:50.479
- Rock paper scissors?
- Rock paper scissors.

22:50.560 --> 22:52.358
One, two, three, shots.

22:52.480 --> 22:53.630
Yes.

22:53.760 --> 22:56.355
Ha! Okay. Great.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.511
First, we have to warm up your voice.

22:58.600 --> 22:59.600
- Okay.
- Like this.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.477
# He... # Oh, what?

23:07.560 --> 23:10.598
I really wanted to show off my voice
but I felt like I was a bit nervous

23:10.680 --> 23:13.991
'cause she was so good,
she just made me feel a bit scared.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.193
- That's even higher.
- Yeah, of course.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.714
- All right.
- We have to warm up.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.400
Go, go, go.

23:32.360 --> 23:34.955
- Don't touch your belly, please.
- I look stupid doing this.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.555
You cannot sing like this
because you will be a waiter.

23:37.640 --> 23:41.156
So, you need to be able to bring stuff,
like this, and then...

23:43.840 --> 23:46.560
I've never met an opera singer
with tattoos before,

23:46.920 --> 23:48.832
uh, but it was actually kind of sexy.

23:49.240 --> 23:50.435
Especially when she sung.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.757
- Do you know <i>Nessun Dorma?</i>
- Who?

23:52.840 --> 23:55.309
Anastasia was a real character.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.312
Um, she can sing.

24:13.440 --> 24:16.114
Dorma.

24:16.240 --> 24:18.960
She was a really good instructor,
actually, she wasn't afraid to tell us

24:19.040 --> 24:21.919
that we were shit, basically.

24:31.840 --> 24:33.115
- More boy?
- More boy!

24:33.200 --> 24:34.680
You are a girl now.

24:37.400 --> 24:38.516
With your normal voice.

24:38.600 --> 24:42.879
Anastasia, uh... She's quite full-on.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.956
Okay, good. Now, listen, stop...

24:48.280 --> 24:53.036
Caspar was the worst student
I have seen in my entire life.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.874
- Let's try a phrase, please, okay?
- Okay.

25:17.720 --> 25:21.316
I must say that
Caspar is a handsome guy, yeah.

25:21.400 --> 25:27.192
He's not my type, he's too much angelic,
you know, too much blonde and light.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.234
I am very dark.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.397
Anastasia definitely fancied Caspar.

25:31.480 --> 25:33.312
<i>I remember when she first
introduced herself,</i>

25:33.400 --> 25:35.312
<i>she looked at Caspar the whole time,
didn't even look at me.</i>

25:35.400 --> 25:37.517
So, yeah, she definitely
wanted a slice of Caspar.

25:37.600 --> 25:38.954
I feel like you're kind of
liking the singing.

25:39.040 --> 25:40.918
You keep touching my hand,
I feel like you enjoyed it.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.435
- I'm sorry.
- I think she fancied me

25:43.600 --> 25:46.593
but she was also, like,
making fun of my pitch.

25:46.680 --> 25:48.558
Do you want to sing like a girl
or like a man?

25:48.640 --> 25:50.996
- Like a man.
- Okay, so, don't...

25:51.080 --> 25:53.311
- Stop singing like a girl.
- Okay.

25:53.400 --> 25:54.880
Be masculine.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.470
No.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.150
Kill me, please.

26:07.240 --> 26:10.153
I think it is impossible that Caspar

26:10.240 --> 26:13.711
can earn some money doing singing.

26:14.680 --> 26:19.960
<i>In fact, I think that
people will be put off the food</i>

26:20.040 --> 26:23.670
<i>if they can hear Caspar singing.</i>

26:24.040 --> 26:27.670
They will be, like, terrified.

26:27.880 --> 26:28.950
- Listen to me.
- Okay.

27:17.440 --> 27:18.760
It was very nerve-wracking,

27:18.840 --> 27:20.479
going out there with a restaurant
full of customers.

27:20.560 --> 27:21.560
And it wasn't just the restaurant,

27:21.640 --> 27:24.439
the whole entire square
is full of tourists.

27:24.600 --> 27:27.991
Caspar went first and I saw that
we weren't going to make money that way

27:28.080 --> 27:29.080
and I thought, "You know what, Sugg,

27:29.160 --> 27:30.196
"you're going to have to pull it
out of the bag."

27:54.040 --> 27:55.713
It made me feel like, uh...

27:55.880 --> 27:57.678
Like I could potentially
be a singer in the future.

27:57.760 --> 28:01.470
I'm really pleased for Joe,
he made money from tips, I didn't.

28:01.560 --> 28:04.439
But Marcello sorted me out.

28:04.520 --> 28:07.638
Making dough made me dough.

28:20.760 --> 28:24.470
- We freaking killed it today.
- I'm so proud of us both.

28:24.760 --> 28:27.195
- How much moulah did we make?
- Moulah!

28:27.280 --> 28:28.794
- Yeah.
- Why are you saying "moulah"?

28:28.880 --> 28:30.280
- Moulah!
- Okay, we made...

28:30.360 --> 28:32.317
- It's my new word.
- We made... We made a lot.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.710
'Cause you killed it
with the singing, man.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.792
Mate, I didn't even know I had it in me.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.792
Who knew I had such big lungs
in this little body of mine?

28:39.960 --> 28:41.235
And also, you with the bloody pizza.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.312
Well, it's kind of obvious you were
going to be really good at making pizza.

28:43.400 --> 28:44.400
Let's be honest.

28:44.480 --> 28:46.437
I feel like I've been training
my whole life for that moment.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.637
That was your moment,
Caspar, and you took it.

28:54.280 --> 28:56.840
Oh, man, I'm sweating.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.479
- Do you know what?
- What?

28:58.560 --> 29:00.153
I need a poo as well.

29:00.240 --> 29:01.913
- I'm not going to lie.
- Joe, I know you need to poo.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.116
I can smell it, buddy.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.351
You've been dropping a few bombs.

29:05.440 --> 29:06.794
No, that's the thing,
I haven't even farted.

29:06.880 --> 29:07.916
- You have.
- No, I haven't.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.152
Because... Trust me, I haven't farted.
If I'd farted... I'm scared to fart.

29:11.240 --> 29:13.197
If I fart, I'm going to follow through.

29:13.280 --> 29:15.192
Hold on, I think I see a lake.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.670
May be they'll have somewhere
to stop over here.

29:17.760 --> 29:20.719
I can't poo in a lake, Caspar.

29:34.360 --> 29:36.192
Oh, wow.

29:36.280 --> 29:37.794
I'll tell you what, mate,

29:37.880 --> 29:40.714
there's worse places in the world
to stop and take a dump.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.157
Joe, do you think you could
take a photo of me,

29:44.240 --> 29:45.833
you know,
looking through this telescope?

29:45.920 --> 29:47.195
I can't, can I?

29:47.280 --> 29:49.237
- What?
- We haven't got our phones with us.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.232
Brian the director's got them.
Remember at the start of the road trip?

29:51.320 --> 29:54.233
He took 'em off us.

29:54.320 --> 29:55.879
Schoolboy error.

29:57.920 --> 29:59.639
Wait, no way! Hold on.

29:59.720 --> 30:01.200
- Joe, come here.
- What are you seeing?

30:01.280 --> 30:03.158
I think two seagulls are having it off.

30:04.760 --> 30:06.080
- Take a look.
- Where am I looking?

30:06.160 --> 30:08.072
- Which way, by that pier?
- To the right.

30:08.160 --> 30:09.640
- Where?
- Up.

30:09.720 --> 30:10.720
Oh...

30:10.800 --> 30:12.234
Oh, are they doing it
or are they fighting?

30:12.320 --> 30:14.152
- I think they're doing it.
- Wait.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.311
Oh, yeah,
they're definitely getting it on.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.278
Oh, I kind of...
I feel a bit guilty looking at this.

30:18.360 --> 30:19.589
Yeah, they're definitely doing it.

30:19.680 --> 30:20.680
Yeah.

30:28.880 --> 30:31.873
So, Joe, I've been thinking
about something a lot recently.

30:31.960 --> 30:36.193
- Right.
- Ah, I'm not sure, you know,

30:36.320 --> 30:39.233
- how to ask.
- Yeah, go for it, man.

30:39.520 --> 30:43.230
- Please don't overreact.
- Oh, God, what is it?

30:43.560 --> 30:46.280
I'd really like to drive.

30:47.920 --> 30:50.640
- Good one.
- No, Joe, I'm being serious.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.951
I'd like to have a turn.

30:53.040 --> 30:54.599
You're serious?

30:54.680 --> 30:58.469
- Wait, wait, you are serious?
- Please, let me drive.

30:58.840 --> 31:00.433
Um...

31:01.320 --> 31:03.277
I'm going to be honest with you, Caspar,

31:03.360 --> 31:05.556
I'm a little bit scared of you being
behind the wheel of this thing.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.791
'Cause one, it's actually
quite hard to drive.

31:07.880 --> 31:09.712
Two, I'm not supposed to tell you this

31:09.800 --> 31:11.792
but I had a chat with Brian
and the rest of the crew.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.673
Brian the director
specifically said to me,

31:13.760 --> 31:17.640
"Joe, no matter what happens,
you can't let Caspar drive the van."

31:17.800 --> 31:20.634
- I'm sorry.
- That's bull, Joe.

31:21.120 --> 31:22.349
There's no way he said that

31:22.440 --> 31:25.877
and even if he did,
who's Brian the director?

31:26.000 --> 31:28.515
He's had 18 years of driving-show
experience, Caspar,

31:28.600 --> 31:30.239
I think he knows
what he's talking about.

31:30.320 --> 31:33.518
- Joe, come on, just let me do it.
- I can't. I'll get in so much trouble.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.080
- Let's do it.
- I'll get some... Get out of the wheel!

31:35.160 --> 31:37.436
- Joe, please? Joe, Joe, Joe.
- I'll get in...

31:37.720 --> 31:38.915
- Look at me.
- I can't.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.593
Joe, look at me.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.356
Oh, don't. I hate it
when you look at me like that. Stop it.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.954
Stop it...

31:45.040 --> 31:46.440
- Stop it.
- Come on.

31:46.520 --> 31:47.954
I'll get in so much trouble.

31:50.240 --> 31:53.278
Fine, okay, we'll do it.

31:53.360 --> 31:54.476
- See this road up here?
- Yeah.

31:54.560 --> 31:56.597
We'll pull in here
and we'll quickly switch round.

31:56.680 --> 31:57.680
Yay!

32:03.560 --> 32:05.153
Oh, my God, I feel alive!

32:05.240 --> 32:06.640
- Ready? Get to gear two...
- Gear two!

32:06.720 --> 32:07.790
Clutch down.

32:07.880 --> 32:09.109
That's it, go, go, go.

32:09.240 --> 32:10.799
- Perfect. Watch out for that bump.
- Yeah!

32:10.880 --> 32:11.996
- Don't hit that bump.
- Oh! Oh!

32:12.080 --> 32:13.080
No, don't hit that.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.310
Sorry. Sorry.

32:14.640 --> 32:16.279
- Okay.
- When was the last time you drove?

32:16.360 --> 32:19.831
Uh... Like in Christmas time?

32:20.040 --> 32:21.440
- Last Christmas.
- Okay, let me rephrase that.

32:21.520 --> 32:24.479
When was the last time you drove a car
and didn't crash?

32:24.840 --> 32:25.910
At school.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.395
I'm gonna give it some beans.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.153
No, no. Caspar, slow down.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.240
Get out of the way.

32:32.320 --> 32:33.834
- This is good, okay, we're fine.
- Okay.

32:33.920 --> 32:35.115
- Give it some beans!
- No, no, just slow down!

32:35.200 --> 32:36.759
- Slow down!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

32:36.840 --> 32:39.480
Joe, I'm doing my best,
you're kind of stressing me out a bit.

32:39.640 --> 32:40.835
Can you just not...

32:41.400 --> 32:42.914
- It's really difficult to drive.
- Stop talking.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.037
Just stop talking
and just concentrate. Please.

32:45.120 --> 32:46.395
- Okay.
- Two hands on the wheel. Right.

32:46.480 --> 32:48.472
<i>Joe, what the hell is going on?</i>

32:48.560 --> 32:51.439
<i>I told you under no circumstances
to let Caspar drive.</i>

32:51.520 --> 32:52.670
What is that, Joe?

32:52.760 --> 32:54.080
- Joe, what is that?
- Who the bloody hell was that?

32:54.160 --> 32:55.958
- Just keep going.
- God?

32:56.600 --> 32:59.069
- Where was that coming from?
<i>- Come in, Joe.</i>

32:59.160 --> 33:01.231
Oh!

33:01.400 --> 33:02.436
Joe to Brian.

33:03.240 --> 33:04.240
<i>What's going on, Joe?</i>

33:04.320 --> 33:06.789
<i>I told you, do not let Caspar drive.
What are you doing?</i>

33:06.880 --> 33:07.916
We're driving!

33:08.000 --> 33:11.118
We're driving. I deserve to drive
just as much as he does!

33:11.320 --> 33:13.551
We, um... How can you even see us?

33:14.760 --> 33:16.160
<i>Guys, pull over now.</i>

33:16.280 --> 33:17.873
No! No, Brian!

33:18.040 --> 33:19.918
I am part of this, too!

33:21.760 --> 33:24.229
<i>I want you guys to pull over,
I mean it.</i>

33:24.320 --> 33:27.677
I am 21 years old,
I'm an independent boy.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.991
Caspar, shut up. Pulling over now.

33:30.080 --> 33:31.230
- No!
<i>- Pull over.</i>

33:31.440 --> 33:32.556
- No!
<i>- Pull over.</i>

33:32.640 --> 33:34.393
No! Joe, fight with me.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.199
- Hello! Okay, pull over! Pull over!
- Fight with me on this.

33:36.280 --> 33:37.475
Fight with me on this.

33:37.560 --> 33:38.994
Close the windows. Close the windows.

33:39.080 --> 33:40.309
- Close the windows.
- Oh, we're in trouble!

33:40.400 --> 33:42.995
- I'm so... I told you it was a bad idea.
- Close the windows!

33:43.080 --> 33:44.480
I told you it was a bad idea.

33:44.560 --> 33:46.711
Okay, okay, Joe, do this with me, boy.

33:46.920 --> 33:49.480
- Okay.
- All right, do as I say. Duck.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.320
- Guys, guys, Caspar.
- Get down.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.470
Joe!

33:53.600 --> 33:55.398
Caspar...

33:55.480 --> 33:57.631
Right, Caspar, open the door.

33:58.200 --> 34:01.398
Guys! Guys, I can see you.
Open the door.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.234
Caspar, get out of the car.

34:10.120 --> 34:11.634
Wow, he looked angry!

34:13.120 --> 34:14.440
I've never seen him like that.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.156
Never.

34:20.239 --> 34:22.630
Let's do this!
Sorry if that went in your eye.

34:24.159 --> 34:25.799
Joe! Wait, hold on, what are you doing?

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Putting it in the kettle.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.717
It should start whistling
when it's ready.

34:35.679 --> 34:37.239
Wow, that's loud.

34:37.320 --> 34:38.879
- What?
- It's really loud.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.757
I know it's really loud!
Should I turn it off?

34:40.840 --> 34:41.989
Yeah.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.719
Oh, no. It's very watery.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.520
- Oh, whatever.
- You've got way more than me.

34:47.600 --> 34:49.193
There you go... Scrape, scrape, scrape.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.429
Well, mine's watery.

34:50.520 --> 34:51.715
Thanks, dude.

34:51.880 --> 34:54.270
- Just one second.
<i>- Bon appétit.</i>

34:54.360 --> 34:55.429
Oh, no!

34:56.199 --> 34:58.476
What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?

34:58.560 --> 35:00.153
My mum told me
that the trick to testing

35:00.240 --> 35:03.233
if pasta's ready or not
is to see if it sticks on the window.

35:03.320 --> 35:05.312
Try with your own food, not mine!

35:06.000 --> 35:07.992
Don't talk to me.

35:08.320 --> 35:09.879
- Sorry, Joe.
- Don't talk to me.

35:25.800 --> 35:28.031
So Caspar, another day, another dollar.

35:28.120 --> 35:29.190
Why are you laughing?

35:29.280 --> 35:31.317
'Cause we're not making dollars,
you idiot.

35:31.400 --> 35:33.710
Yeah, well, anyway,
whilst you were out getting muffins,

35:33.800 --> 35:35.792
which I have no idea
why you thought of that...

35:35.880 --> 35:38.918
Not the ideal thing for breakfast.
I picked up this.

35:39.320 --> 35:42.597
Which is a flyer, for Nolo... Nologo?

35:42.760 --> 35:46.549
Turns out it's a modelling agency.
We're in Milan, the home of fashion

35:46.680 --> 35:48.558
and it says down here
"no experience needed".

35:48.640 --> 35:50.040
What do you say?

35:50.280 --> 35:52.192
Well, Joe, we'd better stop
eating these muffins.

35:52.320 --> 35:53.515
- Should we give it a go?
- Yeah, let's go.

35:53.600 --> 35:54.600
Cool, let's do it.

35:55.440 --> 35:57.193
All right, rubbish.

35:57.520 --> 36:00.433
Oh, I just put my hand in bird poo.
That's gross.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.320
I've always been attractive in my eyes.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.516
What are you on about?

36:21.600 --> 36:22.875
Is it this one here?

36:23.280 --> 36:24.794
- Um...
- Ah, here we go.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.838
- Nolo... Nolo...
- Nolos...

36:26.920 --> 36:28.912
- Nologios?
- Nologo.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
I have no idea. Wait.

36:30.080 --> 36:31.958
There's a buzzer.

36:33.080 --> 36:34.309
- Hi!
- Hello.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.000
- I'm Caspar.
- Hi, Caspar.

36:36.080 --> 36:38.197
- I'm Joe, nice to meet you.
- We're here for the modelling.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.634
Oh, yes, yes, please come in.

36:39.760 --> 36:41.114
- Yay!
- Cool.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.316
Thank you.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.433
They came for an interview...

36:49.520 --> 36:50.556
- Oh, hi!
- Hey!

36:50.640 --> 36:51.756
- Joe, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

36:51.880 --> 36:53.997
- Nice to meet you, I'm Lisa.
- Caspar, nice to meet you.

36:54.080 --> 36:56.151
Okay, so you came for the interview?

36:56.280 --> 36:57.280
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:57.360 --> 37:00.080
But before we start, I just wanted
to make sure you understand that

37:00.160 --> 37:01.480
I'm not just a pretty face.

37:01.560 --> 37:02.560
- Yeah.
- Okay.

37:02.640 --> 37:05.439
And my mum always told me I should
put these giant eyebrows to good use.

37:05.680 --> 37:08.240
- Okay...
- See it?

37:08.320 --> 37:09.834
- Yeah, I see.
- Watch it, this one.

37:09.960 --> 37:11.519
Look at it for a second.

37:12.440 --> 37:13.794
- Shh, Caspar...
- Okay.

37:14.200 --> 37:17.750
So I have just some questions
to ask you before starting. Okay?

37:17.840 --> 37:21.675
Are you doing something?
Studying, working, modelling, maybe?

37:21.760 --> 37:24.150
No, that's the issue, we're currently,
like, travelling around Europe,

37:24.240 --> 37:26.800
trying to look for jobs to earn
enough money to get back home.

37:26.880 --> 37:29.634
Okay, and about modelling,
do you have any experience?

37:29.720 --> 37:32.792
Uh, well, you like taking
Instagram photos and stuff.

37:32.880 --> 37:35.156
Yeah, but who doesn't? Everyone
likes taking Instagram pictures.

37:35.240 --> 37:37.118
- Um, yeah.
- You have Instagram?

37:37.200 --> 37:38.200
- Yeah.
- Okay,

37:38.280 --> 37:39.760
and how many followers do you have?

37:39.840 --> 37:42.639
- Uh, just around about 3.2 million.
- Yeah.

37:42.840 --> 37:45.594
- Sorry? How much?
- 3.2 million.

37:45.920 --> 37:47.036
- Okay, okay.
- Is that good?

37:47.120 --> 37:48.952
Yeah, it's perfect. It's great.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.713
So I'm going to take
some pictures of you

37:50.800 --> 37:52.632
to see how you look
in front of the camera.

37:52.720 --> 37:55.792
We will see you walking over here
and then we will decide together.

37:55.960 --> 37:57.394
- Okay? So...
- Hug?

37:57.560 --> 37:58.710
- No. I'm sorry.
- Okay.

37:58.800 --> 38:01.110
Okay. Let's go over there. Okay?

38:04.720 --> 38:08.680
Okay, guys. The first thing that
we need to do is take measurements.

38:08.760 --> 38:11.639
Okay?
So I need you to take your shirt off.

38:12.840 --> 38:13.876
Uh...

38:14.360 --> 38:16.670
- Sure?
- Yeah. I mean, it's important.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.837
No problem. Hold on...

38:19.480 --> 38:20.960
Director Brian?

38:22.080 --> 38:24.311
Caspar, just take it off,
it's fine. Take it off.

38:28.880 --> 38:31.634
To be honest, you're a little bit
short to be a model.

38:34.280 --> 38:36.033
- Stop, stop moving.
- Sorry.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.474
- Stop moving, stop moving.
- Sorry.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.790
Now we will start
with the pictures, okay?

38:43.880 --> 38:45.553
Look in front of me and you don't move.

38:46.600 --> 38:47.795
This way, and look in front.

38:47.880 --> 38:49.553
I've got a spot on this side, though.

38:49.640 --> 38:51.120
Don't worry, it's not a problem.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.395
Which is my good angle?

38:52.560 --> 38:53.755
I think all your angles
are good, mate.

38:53.840 --> 38:55.399
Thanks, buddy.

38:55.640 --> 38:57.472
- You're running through the jungle...
- Okay.

38:57.560 --> 38:59.040
- From a tiger...
- Yeah.

38:59.120 --> 39:01.237
- What kind of tiger?
- Uh, just a big one.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.512
React, ready? Three, two, one, go.

39:08.240 --> 39:10.391
Okay. Now, Joe, please, it's your turn.

39:10.480 --> 39:11.516
Okay, yep. Me.

39:11.680 --> 39:13.433
Okay, so fix...

39:13.520 --> 39:14.636
What are these?

39:15.520 --> 39:16.840
- These?
- Yeah.

39:16.920 --> 39:19.230
- They're secret socks.
- Okay.

39:19.720 --> 39:20.915
Do you not have them in Italy?

39:21.000 --> 39:22.639
You put these on
before you wear plimsolls.

39:22.720 --> 39:25.076
Can't see you've got socks on
but you still have socks on.

39:25.880 --> 39:26.880
Look it up.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.958
Dude, don't be rude to the photographer,
take your socks off.

39:29.040 --> 39:30.838
- I'm not, I'm just saying...
- Come on, Joe!

39:30.920 --> 39:32.149
Joe, take the socks off.

39:33.360 --> 39:34.635
Yes, Director Brian.

39:35.360 --> 39:36.919
He's so powerful.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.080
Okay.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.033
Your sister just told you
she's pregnant.

39:46.200 --> 39:47.475
- Oh, that's good.
- Okay.

39:47.560 --> 39:49.791
Now, guys, we need to do
pictures in underwear.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.274
Oh... All of us?

39:52.560 --> 39:53.710
No, just you.

39:53.880 --> 39:55.075
- One second, sorry.
- Yeah.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.640
We need to talk about this.

39:57.440 --> 39:59.477
I don't feel
like this is appropriate.

39:59.920 --> 40:00.920
I agree.

40:01.040 --> 40:02.394
Maybe we should ask Director Brian.

40:02.480 --> 40:03.516
I can't ask him.

40:03.600 --> 40:06.035
Also, you're not a very good whisperer,
I think everyone can still hear us.

40:06.120 --> 40:10.399
- Shut up.
- Uh... Director Brian?

40:11.000 --> 40:13.310
- Yeah, Joe?
- We're not too sure

40:13.400 --> 40:14.470
if we're comfortable with this.

40:14.640 --> 40:18.031
We don't want people to think
that we're cheap and easy.

40:18.720 --> 40:20.234
And we don't feel comfortable

40:20.320 --> 40:22.039
being the only ones in our underwear.

40:22.120 --> 40:25.238
And we don't feel comfortable
being the only ones in our underwear.

40:26.880 --> 40:30.396
So, we do the same way,
front, profile and three quarters.

40:30.720 --> 40:31.995
Ready?

40:33.360 --> 40:35.591
I'm sorry,
I really need to use the bathroom.

40:35.680 --> 40:37.831
- Okay, Joe, please, your turn.
- Yeah.

40:39.680 --> 40:42.320
When they asked me to take
my clothes off, it was a bit of a shock.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.113
Normally, I do it anyway, all the time.

40:44.200 --> 40:46.669
But it seems weird
when there's a very attractive lady

40:46.760 --> 40:48.114
telling you to take your clothes off.

40:48.200 --> 40:49.395
Doesn't happen that often.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.517
When it does, you know,
I wasn't really prepared for it.

40:51.600 --> 40:58.200
Joe's body is kind of not ordinary,
in this world, I mean.

40:58.280 --> 41:01.079
Because he has really a thin body

41:01.280 --> 41:06.230
and he has, like, kind of
girl measurements, I would say.

41:08.520 --> 41:11.115
They thought Joe had the body of a girl?

41:11.200 --> 41:13.237
Oh, he's not going to like that.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.558
So let me introduce you to Gaia.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.996
- Hi Gaia. Caspar, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.958
She's the booker of the men's division.

41:20.040 --> 41:21.076
Oh, wow, so you're in charge.

41:21.160 --> 41:22.276
- Yeah, sure.
- Hmm...

41:22.360 --> 41:24.272
What did you think of our photos?
Have you seen them yet?

41:24.360 --> 41:27.114
They're very nice.
You're very peculiar people.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.594
- Peculiar?
- Yes.

41:28.680 --> 41:29.830
That's a compliment, right?

41:29.920 --> 41:31.115
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, definitely.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.398
Okay, so, let's start with the walking.

41:50.120 --> 41:51.236
Joe!

41:52.920 --> 41:54.036
Joe?

41:54.560 --> 41:55.560
That's enough.

41:56.600 --> 41:57.600
Joe!

42:00.440 --> 42:01.556
Let's get down to business.

42:01.680 --> 42:03.080
- So this is the casting room.
- Yes.

42:03.160 --> 42:05.117
This is the place where
we make all the decisions.

42:05.280 --> 42:06.396
We're going to be rich.

42:06.480 --> 42:09.552
And we're going to make one
about you guys.

42:09.720 --> 42:12.189
- Okay.
- Because I have seen a lot of boys

42:12.280 --> 42:13.873
but nobody like you.

42:13.960 --> 42:17.032
And I think I can have
the right job for you,

42:17.320 --> 42:19.312
which is perfect for you, today.

42:19.400 --> 42:20.959
- Okay.
- Okay, at 2:00,

42:21.040 --> 42:23.396
be on time at this address, here.

42:23.480 --> 42:24.755
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

42:24.840 --> 42:26.240
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

42:26.400 --> 42:27.550
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

42:27.640 --> 42:29.359
Thanks so much. Thank you.

42:30.080 --> 42:32.914
Oh! Thank you so much!

42:33.000 --> 42:34.593
You really don't know
how much this means to us.

42:34.680 --> 42:35.750
Okay.

42:35.880 --> 42:37.234
Why are you laughing?

42:37.360 --> 42:38.476
We were in there,
I thought, you know what,

42:38.560 --> 42:41.758
modelling might not actually be my thing
because, obviously, the height thing.

42:41.920 --> 42:44.674
Uh, but yeah, we both got a job
out of it, so we're really pleased.

42:44.760 --> 42:47.639
Holy mackerels, they loved us.

42:47.720 --> 42:50.554
Did you see that? And I think
we're going to get a huge job later.

42:50.640 --> 42:52.757
They seem like a pretty well established
modelling agency.

42:52.840 --> 42:54.797
They knew what they were doing,
they were pretty professional,

42:54.880 --> 42:56.280
it's got to be something good,
it's got to be.

42:56.480 --> 42:58.358
I felt a bit intimidated
when we walked in,

42:58.440 --> 43:01.512
'cause there were so many
pictures of good-looking people.

43:01.800 --> 43:03.359
<i>They were quite
impressed by your muscles.</i>

43:03.760 --> 43:05.911
They were impressed by my muscles?

43:06.600 --> 43:07.600
No way!

43:07.680 --> 43:09.319
Yeah, they think
you had a really good body.

43:09.400 --> 43:12.234
I've been swimming
a little bit recently, so...

43:12.520 --> 43:13.874
That's really nice to know.

43:13.960 --> 43:15.394
They said I had the body of a girl?

43:16.160 --> 43:17.160
- Yeah.
- Really?

43:17.240 --> 43:18.959
- Yeah.
- You're joking.

43:19.040 --> 43:20.918
I'm not,
that's exactly what they said.

43:23.400 --> 43:25.357
That's bullshit. That's bullshit.

43:26.200 --> 43:28.078
That's actually really not nice.

43:28.160 --> 43:29.913
- They actually said that?
- They did say that.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.037
They're supposed to be professional.

43:32.360 --> 43:35.512
Crush your dreams like that,
it's stupid.

43:46.640 --> 43:49.439
What a successful morning!
We absolutely smashed it, mate.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.040
I'm so proud of us.

43:51.120 --> 43:52.315
Are you sure
these were a good buy, though?

43:52.400 --> 43:54.278
I mean, we spent all
of our money from Verona.

43:54.360 --> 43:55.680
Of course, it's a wise investment.

43:55.760 --> 43:57.194
And we're going to look
the absolute part,

43:57.280 --> 43:59.237
we're going to make so much money.

44:10.840 --> 44:12.274
- We're here.
- Oh my gosh, we're here.

44:12.360 --> 44:13.714
We're models and we're here, this is it.

44:13.800 --> 44:14.916
AC Milan!

44:15.000 --> 44:17.276
What do you think of my, uh...
My new purchase?

44:17.360 --> 44:18.555
Yeah, scarves, we're models now.

44:18.640 --> 44:20.552
- Yeah, you like it?
- We're models.

44:20.640 --> 44:23.474
Caspar, you're going to work with me
in the shirts department.

44:24.760 --> 44:27.195
Joe, you come with me,
another part of the store.

44:27.280 --> 44:28.280
Oh, okay!

44:28.360 --> 44:30.033
Joe, this is my big break!

44:30.120 --> 44:32.316
I'm going to be a real model
like Katie Price.

44:32.400 --> 44:34.278
Where am I going?

44:39.560 --> 44:41.040
So, Marcello, where can I put these on?

44:41.120 --> 44:42.839
I feel like
I need something more private.

44:42.920 --> 44:44.559
I know I'm a model but I get shy.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.553
- So where can I get changed?
- No, no, no Caspar. That's not your job.

44:47.960 --> 44:48.960
What?

44:49.120 --> 44:51.476
Your job is to put the name on it.

44:52.240 --> 44:53.879
Put the name on the shirt?

44:54.560 --> 44:55.880
No, no, no, I'm a model.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.232
My first reaction when I found out
that I wasn't doing any modelling today

44:59.320 --> 45:04.520
and I was putting names on T-shirts
was one of devastation.

45:04.600 --> 45:10.278
You have to choose the letters,
like, C, A, S...

45:10.480 --> 45:12.073
This is like <i>Countdown.</i>

45:13.120 --> 45:14.713
I'm really disappointed.

45:14.840 --> 45:16.593
I thought I was going
to be a model today.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.994
But then I started cheering up
a little bit, because I realised

45:21.080 --> 45:24.915
that the people here weren't judging me
based on things like looks

45:25.000 --> 45:29.279
or height or weight, they were
judging me because of my skills

45:29.360 --> 45:31.750
and my, you know, friendliness.

45:31.840 --> 45:34.674
Wow, Marcello, I've never made something
like this before. Thank you so much.

45:34.760 --> 45:37.434
How many am I going to have to make
in the next four hours?

45:38.880 --> 45:40.553
We have a list, man.

45:42.160 --> 45:43.833
- Let's start.
- What!

45:44.040 --> 45:46.077
There must be hundreds of names on here.

45:46.760 --> 45:48.240
We'll never have time.

45:48.320 --> 45:49.993
Trust me, we will.

45:51.240 --> 45:52.754
What kind of name is Klein?

46:18.120 --> 46:20.840
Caspar. Caspar.

46:21.040 --> 46:22.040
Hello?

46:22.120 --> 46:23.120
It's me, Joe.

46:23.240 --> 46:24.674
- No, it's not.
- They put me in this giant suit.

46:24.760 --> 46:26.479
- It's so hot!
- What?

46:26.560 --> 46:28.153
I can't breathe.

46:28.240 --> 46:30.596
What the hell have they done to you?

46:33.200 --> 46:35.431
- You look ridiculous.
- Don't just stand there and laugh,

46:35.520 --> 46:36.874
- help me!
- Yeah...

46:39.240 --> 46:41.630
You look like Po from the <i>Teletubbies.</i>

46:41.720 --> 46:43.518
No!

46:43.600 --> 46:47.913
Four hours, wait,
I've got only four fingers.

46:48.120 --> 46:51.158
I spent four hours in this thing.
Do you know how hot it is in here?

46:52.040 --> 46:53.156
<i>Very, very warm.</i>

46:53.240 --> 46:54.240
<i>I tell you what,</i>

46:54.800 --> 46:58.271
<i>doing this actually, was modelling,
but it's also playing a character.</i>

46:58.360 --> 47:01.398
So, I'm thinking now, maybe,
I could try a bit of acting.

47:04.240 --> 47:06.118
Where's the camera?

47:07.080 --> 47:08.080
<i>Ciao!</i>

47:09.160 --> 47:10.913
Goooooal!

47:11.000 --> 47:12.150
I had to take loads and
loads of photographs,

47:12.240 --> 47:13.799
which was great, you know,

47:13.880 --> 47:16.952
but the weird thing was when you
take a picture, you're used to smiling

47:17.040 --> 47:19.350
so I kept smiling
beneath the helmet thing

47:19.440 --> 47:21.397
and obviously
I realised, like, halfway through,

47:21.480 --> 47:23.153
what's the point of smiling?
They can't see it.

47:23.240 --> 47:24.435
<i>I'm just a big devil.</i>

47:24.680 --> 47:26.080
Joe, you know what,
I've actually done something,

47:26.160 --> 47:27.196
that I think is going to cheer you up.

47:27.280 --> 47:28.714
Right, okay, what?

47:28.800 --> 47:30.120
You just stay right there,
I'm going to fetch it.

47:30.200 --> 47:31.200
Okay.

47:31.720 --> 47:35.600
I got you a brand new AC Milan shirt
with your name on it!

47:35.680 --> 47:36.680
Yes!

47:41.280 --> 47:42.280
What the hell is that?

47:42.840 --> 47:45.719
It's a... It's an AC Milan football top.

47:45.800 --> 47:49.555
I'm in this giant suit,
which has been used before,

47:49.640 --> 47:51.871
it smells like an old sock. Right?

47:52.160 --> 47:53.879
- Yeah?
- What age is this?

47:53.960 --> 47:55.838
- What age?
- Age...

47:56.920 --> 48:00.072
- It's just, uh, UK 7-8.
- Well, well, then...

48:00.160 --> 48:03.232
I think you should be more appreciative,
I've been working my arse off all day.

48:03.320 --> 48:05.039
And they gave me that for free
to give you

48:05.120 --> 48:07.954
'cause I did such a good job
and all you do is complain.

48:08.040 --> 48:09.110
How many have you had to do?

48:09.320 --> 48:11.437
I mean, like, hundreds.

48:11.520 --> 48:13.830
Joe wasn't very grateful
when I gave him a shirt.

48:13.920 --> 48:15.798
I'm surprised that
he's surprised, because

48:15.880 --> 48:19.430
it was clearly for a 7-year-old boy,
not a...

48:19.520 --> 48:21.955
But then again, I did get told
today that I had a girl's body,

48:22.040 --> 48:23.076
but that's not the point.

48:23.160 --> 48:24.514
That's not the point, Brian.

48:25.080 --> 48:26.116
You know?

48:26.200 --> 48:30.399
He didn't react very well.
Kind of a bit spoilt, if you ask me.

48:30.480 --> 48:31.880
I think YouTube's gone to his head.

48:32.480 --> 48:35.314
Anyway, I have to get back to work.
See you in a bit.

48:35.640 --> 48:37.154
- Proud of you, man.
- Do you want a picture?

48:37.360 --> 48:39.716
I'd sure would love a picture
but I don't have a phone.

48:39.880 --> 48:41.599
- Too late, take care. Ta-ra.
- Okay.

48:51.960 --> 48:55.032
- Get your shoe, Joe.
- I think I broke my knee. Ow!

48:55.280 --> 48:56.714
<i>Caspar got paid 50?</i>

48:56.840 --> 48:59.230
<i>Well, that's great, that's good,
that's good and...</i>

48:59.320 --> 49:00.515
<i>Well, how much did I get paid?</i>

49:00.640 --> 49:02.711
- You got paid 40.
- Forty.

49:02.800 --> 49:03.870
Okay.

49:03.960 --> 49:05.838
I don't think that's fair,
I'm not going to lie.

49:05.920 --> 49:08.151
That's not fair, who decided that?

49:08.840 --> 49:09.840
I'm not having this.

49:09.920 --> 49:11.752
I've been wearing this suit
for four hours,

49:11.840 --> 49:13.274
sweating my tits off!

49:13.600 --> 49:15.831
And Caspar's over there
just stamping on letters on a shirt,

49:15.920 --> 49:17.274
I'm surprised he can spell.

49:18.320 --> 49:19.993
Did he even finish school? Probably not.

49:20.080 --> 49:22.356
How can he even spell? He can't even
spell my name right. Probably.

49:22.440 --> 49:24.875
I haven't really looked
at the shirt yet, properly.

49:24.960 --> 49:27.191
That's rubbish. Right, I'm going to go
and get out of this costume.

49:38.920 --> 49:40.070
How's that knee of yours?

49:41.800 --> 49:42.995
Still hurts.

49:44.520 --> 49:46.557
Well, at least we made 90 euros today.

49:50.600 --> 49:53.274
- 70 euros.
- No, no, we made 90.

49:53.360 --> 49:56.319
No, 70 euros. Think about it.

49:56.400 --> 49:59.120
The modelling agency
takes 20% commission.

49:59.560 --> 50:01.597
But surely AC Milan pay that.

50:01.680 --> 50:03.319
No, don't be stupid.

50:03.400 --> 50:05.278
Anyway, Caspar, we've got
a long drive to Cannes tomorrow

50:05.360 --> 50:06.874
and we're going to need this for petrol.

50:13.120 --> 50:14.873
I hope they give refunds.

50:15.280 --> 50:16.280
Yeah, same.

50:19.560 --> 50:21.119
So, it's come down to this.

50:21.680 --> 50:24.434
Four mints. Um...

50:24.560 --> 50:26.597
I guess the only way
to decide who gets them

50:26.720 --> 50:28.791
is to do a sack race
in our sleeping bags

50:28.960 --> 50:30.838
around the camper van and that tree.

50:30.920 --> 50:34.357
Last one back to this point
is the loser.

50:34.440 --> 50:36.033
Three, two, one, go.

50:37.440 --> 50:39.432
You're pushing me!
You can't push me, Caspar.

50:39.520 --> 50:42.080
I'm going to hurt myself.

50:43.160 --> 50:45.800
Yeah, I won. I won, I won, I won, I won.

50:46.960 --> 50:48.519
Joe, you threw the mints!

50:52.400 --> 50:54.596
I'm sure there's some crisps
still in there, anyway.

50:59.360 --> 51:01.829
So, Caspar, we've got about
200 miles to get to Cannes

51:01.920 --> 51:03.912
and we've only got 70 euros left.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.310
So, um... Yeah, we're in trouble.

51:08.040 --> 51:09.872
I'm really hungry.

51:10.120 --> 51:11.315
Well, at the moment,

51:11.400 --> 51:14.313
petrol is more important than food,
I'm afraid.

51:14.400 --> 51:16.437
You were the one
who made us buy those stupid scarves,

51:16.520 --> 51:18.398
we would have so much money still.

51:18.480 --> 51:21.314
Okay, one, they were not stupid,
they were fashionable and cool,

51:21.400 --> 51:22.914
and two...

51:23.280 --> 51:26.398
Yeah, okay, that was quite
a stupid idea, I'm sorry.

51:27.840 --> 51:30.639
Everyone makes mistakes, Caspar,
it's just one of those things.

51:30.720 --> 51:32.359
It's a long road trip,
we're going to make a lot of mistakes,

51:32.440 --> 51:34.238
but we're going to learn from them
and we're going to move on.

51:34.880 --> 51:35.880
Oh, wait, hang on,

51:35.960 --> 51:37.474
there's a sign here
for a petrol station.

51:55.520 --> 51:56.749
Wait here.

51:56.920 --> 51:59.310
- Why do I always have to wait here?
- It's fine.

51:59.400 --> 52:00.629
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

52:00.720 --> 52:02.677
Erm, do you do it, or do I do it?

52:02.760 --> 52:04.274
You do it? Brilliant.

52:04.360 --> 52:07.034
Er, we want... Caspar, how much, 65?

52:07.120 --> 52:08.349
Joe, why do you tell me
to stay in the front

52:08.440 --> 52:10.671
when you needed
some crucial information from me?

52:10.760 --> 52:11.760
Sixty-five, yeah?

52:11.840 --> 52:14.309
Yes... How can you not remember
that kind of basic information?

52:14.640 --> 52:16.518
Why is this key not going in?
There we go.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.400
Oh, I've done it!

52:18.760 --> 52:20.558
- I'm proud of you.
- You don't know how hard that was.

52:20.640 --> 52:23.075
Like, last petrol station,
we could not do it. Took ages,

52:23.160 --> 52:25.117
we had to get Phil to do it,
Phil the cameraman, for us.

52:25.200 --> 52:26.714
Done it, I've done it!

52:32.120 --> 52:33.793
So, what's your favourite colour?

52:40.360 --> 52:42.556
You have a favourite colour?

52:47.880 --> 52:50.111
- Okay, we just spent 65 for petrol.
- Yeah.

52:50.200 --> 52:51.919
- Now we've got five euros left.
- Okay.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
Let's make this work.

52:53.240 --> 52:55.357
- Biscuits? Not feeling that?
- No.

52:55.440 --> 52:57.318
- Ice cream!
- Yeah, let's do it.

52:57.400 --> 52:58.720
- You think...
- Chocolate is healthy,

52:58.800 --> 53:00.359
ice creams are cooling.

53:00.440 --> 53:01.954
It's just going to melt, isn't it?
It's not very filling, is it?

53:02.040 --> 53:03.110
It's what you have at the beach.

53:03.200 --> 53:04.475
We're in a sweaty camper van.

53:04.560 --> 53:08.076
Well, we could get one pack of this
and maybe haggle them down for this.

53:08.160 --> 53:09.674
How much for these two?

53:09.760 --> 53:11.114
We only have five.

53:11.840 --> 53:12.876
Okay.

53:12.960 --> 53:15.156
- Oh!
- You're a master at this.

53:15.240 --> 53:17.277
- Thank you. Oh, you're the best.
- Okay.

53:18.680 --> 53:21.798
Joe, maybe I should become a haggler.

53:21.880 --> 53:24.793
Nice, but what did you buy?
What even are these?

53:25.200 --> 53:26.270
Oh, God.

53:27.520 --> 53:29.034
That's...

53:29.120 --> 53:30.349
Why did we buy this?

53:30.440 --> 53:32.113
I think we just got
caught up in the moment, didn't we,

53:32.200 --> 53:33.200
and bought the wrong thing?

53:33.280 --> 53:35.192
- I haggled him.
- We should've got bread.

53:35.280 --> 53:37.715
At least this will
keep us going until Cannes.

53:37.800 --> 53:39.598
Yeah, hopefully, erm...

53:39.680 --> 53:40.716
But then when we get there,

53:40.800 --> 53:42.120
we need to find
some proper work, all right?

53:42.200 --> 53:43.600
Proper work leads to proper food.

53:43.680 --> 53:45.672
- Like lobster?
- Yes, like lobster.

53:46.240 --> 53:47.356
Come on, let's go.

53:52.880 --> 53:54.758
Joe, did you ever think,
like, two years ago,

53:54.840 --> 53:56.115
when you were on a roof thatching,

53:56.200 --> 53:58.635
that you would be driving around Europe
in a camper van

53:58.720 --> 54:00.837
with, like, the coolest South African
in the whole world?

54:01.720 --> 54:04.394
And, look at it.
There's that Ian, cameraman guy,

54:04.480 --> 54:05.994
one of the best cameramen
in the whole world,

54:06.080 --> 54:07.992
- and he's like 67 years old.
- Look at him.

54:08.080 --> 54:09.958
And he's just loving life.

54:10.040 --> 54:11.599
I've never looked at
a bloke before and thought,

54:11.680 --> 54:13.273
"Do you know what?
He looks like a veteran."

54:13.360 --> 54:14.635
That's how I describe him.

54:14.720 --> 54:16.439
He looks like an absolute veteran.

54:16.520 --> 54:18.159
So, look, Caspar,
we're about halfway through the trip

54:18.720 --> 54:20.552
and we still haven't even named
the camper van yet.

54:20.640 --> 54:22.393
I feel like we should name it
something with a C,

54:22.480 --> 54:24.119
so it's something, the camper van.

54:24.200 --> 54:25.395
Caspar?

54:25.480 --> 54:28.120
No, definitely not Caspar,
anything but Caspar.

54:28.200 --> 54:29.919
Do you think it's a girl or a boy?

54:30.000 --> 54:31.673
Uh, it's, uh, definitely a girl.

54:31.880 --> 54:33.553
Cucumber.

54:33.840 --> 54:35.911
It's a C but it's not a girl's name.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.036
I thought...

54:37.120 --> 54:38.270
How many girls do you know
called Cucumber?

54:38.360 --> 54:40.670
I just thought, 'cause, you know,
cucumbers are cool.

54:40.760 --> 54:42.353
Yes, but it's not a girl's name, is it?

54:42.440 --> 54:45.353
Okay, what about Katy?

54:45.440 --> 54:48.672
Yeah, Katy's good, Katy's good,
it's not a C,

54:48.760 --> 54:50.240
but it's got a ring to it.

54:50.320 --> 54:52.471
- Katy the camper.
- Katy the camper van.

54:52.560 --> 54:54.199
Do you know what? I actually like that.

54:54.280 --> 54:57.193
That's good. For once,
you've actually done something right.

54:57.280 --> 54:59.749
- I'm proud of you.
- Aw.

55:15.200 --> 55:17.669
- Are you ready for this?
- I'm so ready.

55:19.480 --> 55:20.834
Ta-da!

55:32.000 --> 55:34.435
Oh, they're supposed to stick.

55:45.800 --> 55:47.598
So, this is what it's come down to.

55:47.680 --> 55:50.275
Two free glasses of tap water
and one sweet.

55:55.400 --> 55:57.756
Yes!

56:04.760 --> 56:06.911
Anyway, I've been looking
through the paper at jobs

56:07.000 --> 56:08.229
and there are a lot of temporary jobs

56:08.320 --> 56:10.915
but they require you to speak fluent
French, which obviously we can't do.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.196
There's one job down here

56:13.280 --> 56:14.760
but it's manual labour.

56:16.480 --> 56:18.153
What's that?

56:18.240 --> 56:19.833
Manual labour.

56:19.920 --> 56:22.594
- Yeah?
- You don't know what that is?

56:23.160 --> 56:25.755
- It says here "deck hands".
- Like on a yacht?

56:25.840 --> 56:28.799
- Do you think?
- Yeah. I saw Kylie Jenner had a yacht

56:28.880 --> 56:30.200
in an Instagram photo one time

56:30.280 --> 56:32.192
and there were loads
of pretty girls on there.

56:32.280 --> 56:33.634
- Really?
- Yeah.

56:33.760 --> 56:35.035
This could be the one.

56:39.120 --> 56:41.919
We're looking for Bay 412.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.037
That's 417, so we're
obviously on the right track.

56:44.560 --> 56:46.119
414...

56:46.680 --> 56:48.353
- 413, 41...
- There it is.

56:48.480 --> 56:49.755
- Awesome.
- That must be it.

56:49.840 --> 56:51.718
He looks quite scary.

56:51.800 --> 56:52.836
You speak to him.

56:52.920 --> 56:54.434
Pascal, when I first saw him,
I was a little bit scared.

56:54.520 --> 56:57.080
He had those round lens glasses

56:57.160 --> 56:58.833
that reflect back
so you couldn't see his eyes.

56:58.920 --> 57:00.673
He looks like a Bond villain.

57:00.760 --> 57:01.989
- Don't laugh.
- Sorry.

57:02.080 --> 57:04.311
Hi, uh, we saw your advert in the paper.

57:04.400 --> 57:06.392
- You're looking for deck hands?
- Yeah, yeah, great.

57:06.480 --> 57:07.755
Come on board for a chat.

57:07.840 --> 57:08.876
- Sweet.
- Thank you.

57:08.960 --> 57:10.076
<i>When I first
turned up at the boat,</i>

57:10.160 --> 57:11.719
<i>I was really intimidated by Pascal.</i>

57:11.800 --> 57:14.235
Obviously, when you see someone
on a boat that expensive,

57:14.320 --> 57:17.597
you assume they're quite
powerful and scary.

57:18.280 --> 57:21.034
Okay, guys, uh, let me
introduce you to Jenny.

57:21.120 --> 57:22.349
She's my yacht manager.

57:22.440 --> 57:23.556
- Hi.
- Hi, Jenny.

57:23.640 --> 57:26.599
Later on, we're taking the boat out,
so I have some friend coming.

57:26.680 --> 57:29.070
And I want the boat
really, really clean.

57:29.160 --> 57:31.880
So, I leave you with Jenny
and she'll tell you what to do.

57:32.160 --> 57:34.470
- Okay, have fun. Bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

57:34.560 --> 57:36.552
Okay, guys, I'll get your crew uniforms

57:36.640 --> 57:37.790
and I hope you're good at cleaning.

57:37.880 --> 57:40.156
- Oh, we're the best.
- Yeah, um...

57:40.240 --> 57:42.755
Just, uh, out of interest,
how much are we getting paid for this?

57:42.840 --> 57:44.069
The pay is 15 euros an hour.

57:44.160 --> 57:45.196
Per person, or...

57:45.600 --> 57:46.670
That is each.

57:47.120 --> 57:48.713
I mean, that seems pretty standard,

57:48.840 --> 57:50.274
- for a day's work.
- Yeah.

57:50.360 --> 57:51.794
Think about it, mate.
We can earn a lot of money here.

57:51.880 --> 57:53.951
- I can get a natural tan.
- Exactly. Three hours, 15 euros each...

57:54.040 --> 57:55.269
- Okay, here we go.
- Hey...

57:55.360 --> 57:57.192
Oh, wow. Thanks, Jenny.

57:57.280 --> 57:59.511
- You're the best.
- You are the best.

58:01.080 --> 58:02.594
- Cool.
- Ooh!

58:13.520 --> 58:15.751
Caspar, would you just put the cushions
out round the table, please?

58:15.840 --> 58:17.877
Yes, sir... Ma'am. Sorry.

58:17.960 --> 58:19.917
- Just around in all the corners.
- Okay.

58:27.360 --> 58:28.794
Uh...

58:29.600 --> 58:31.512
- Surely you've put cushions out before?
- Yeah.

58:31.600 --> 58:32.875
- Uh, yeah.
- Right.

58:35.120 --> 58:37.510
- All right.
- Right, so just do them like that.

58:37.600 --> 58:38.875
- Okay?
- Yeah.

58:59.640 --> 59:01.359
Don't mind if I do.

59:05.840 --> 59:07.240
Oh.

59:11.960 --> 59:13.997
Okay, guys.
We've got few guests arriving early,

59:14.120 --> 59:16.476
so if you can get the champagne open,
that would be great.

59:16.560 --> 59:19.120
And we're just about to take
the boat out for some engine checks.

59:19.200 --> 59:21.476
I don't know if this is too much
but we have a crew with us

59:21.560 --> 59:23.870
and we're wondering if we can
maybe bring them along?

59:23.960 --> 59:27.431
- Uh, how many of you got?
- Um, it's those guys.

59:28.280 --> 59:30.317
Okay.

59:32.400 --> 59:34.471
Who would've thought, earlier today,
we were in a camper van,

59:34.560 --> 59:36.233
now we're on a super-yacht.

59:36.320 --> 59:37.549
It's crazy how life changes.

59:37.640 --> 59:39.313
Caspar, I'm worried this is all
going to your head, mate.

59:39.400 --> 59:41.756
- You need to snap out of it.
- It's not going to my head.

59:45.600 --> 59:46.920
Come here.

59:48.680 --> 59:51.798
Hi, guys. Hi, Joanne.
Hey, welcome onboard.

59:51.880 --> 59:53.280
Come and have some champagne.

59:53.360 --> 59:55.272
- How are you?
- How are you?

59:55.600 --> 59:57.432
- Welcome. Welcome aboard.
- Oh, thank you.

59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.433
Thank you.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.115
Thank you.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.432
Both the girls
were really hot, don't you think?

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.751
Yeah, yeah. I hope he's gay.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.799
Ah, more birdshit!

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.238
- It's not coming off.
- Okay, guys.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.676
I was just with Pascal.
He's been driving the boat

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.240
and he's really pleased
with the work you've done today.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.515
So thanks for that.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.034
And he'd like you to join
the party with us

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.440
until the main guests arrive.

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:35.636
- Aw. Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:36.720
Cheers!

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.352
I was thirsty.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.472
- Hold on to me, Joe, hold on tight.
- I'm holding on.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:50.279
- I'll never let go, Caspar.
- You promise?

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.874
- I'll never let go.
- Thank you.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.389
I know it's hard to believe
because I'm so fresh-faced

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.550
but this actually my...

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:17.790
Oh, my God. He's underneath me.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.400
Oh, my God.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.520
Go on, Caspar.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:23.070
<i>I think today, I would rate
it a solid nine and a half.</i>

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:26.756
<i>The reason it doesn't get a 10 is
because all the crew got their kit off.</i>

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:28.194
<i>And no one wants to see that.</i>

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.715
<i>Right now, I'm quite
tired after all of that activity.</i>

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:35.158
<i>But inside, I'm just...
I can't even explain, I'm so happy,</i>

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:38.711
<i>I had so much fun
and I just really wish I had a boat.</i>

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.994
<i>It was the best experience of my life.</i>

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.796
<i>Okay, guys,
you really did a good job.</i>

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:57.191
You work well, you party hard.

01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.112
It's really, really cool.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:02.796
So, if you fancy a little more money,
guys, a few euros,

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.840
I've got a couple of cars to clean.
Would you be interested?

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:08.115
- Of course.
- Yes, yes.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.271
- Sure? Okay. So, let's do it.
- Thank you so much.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.957
- Thank you.
- That's okay, guys.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.440
- Thank you, Dad.
- That was really cool.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.432
Why is there not more people
in the world like you, Pascal?

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.554
Careful we don't dent it.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.472
Who is it?

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.914
- Was it the old man?
- Yeah.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.480
Oh, he's running away.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:09.274
I think, without a doubt,
that's been my favourite day.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.192
Joe, wow!

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.319
Who would've thought
when we left London without any money

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:15.357
we would end up on a yacht
in the south of France?

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.999
You just couldn't write it, could you?

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.719
And Pascalas well,
when we first met him,

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.996
I was thinking,
"Oh, God, this guy looks shady."

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.912
Turned out to be the nicest guy
we've ever met.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.600
And he said, "Let me know when
you're next in the south of France."

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.717
And we can go back on there again
and do some more work.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.439
- Oh, he is the best.
- I know.

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:32.758
Being on that boat really reminded me
of South Africa, like,

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:36.470
- blue sky, the fresh air, the adventure.
- Blue water.

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:39.234
Also, how the hell did you fall in,
you plonker? How did that happen?

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:43.030
Well, you know, I was chatting up
the girls and, uh,

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.510
obviously being a bit risky
at the same time

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.991
by leaning over the side and then
all of a sudden, I kind of fell in.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.673
But they thought it was cute,
to be honest.

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.353
If only we could always have
a super-yacht on hand

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.636
- whenever we meet girls.
- Oh, that would help.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.590
Joe, I've got to be honest
with you, um...

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:07.115
All of that boating
has made me very tired.

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.477
Yeah, me too, man.

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:13.440
Do you think I can have a little nap?
Like an hour or two and then...

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:15.512
Yeah, mate. Oh, no, no, you go ahead.

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:18.752
No, no, it's fine.
I'll just sit here on my own.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.559
I'll start singing. I'll sing to myself.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:24.116
That's fine, I can handle
this whole trip. It's fine.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.429
- You sure?
- Yeah, no, no, no.

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.352
Honestly, that's fine.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:30.956
It's fine. No, no, no, no, no.
No, stop that, it's fine.

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.040
We've got this.

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:55.390
Mate, look.

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:58.032
- Look where we are.
- Where?

01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.440
Barcelona.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:00.950
- What?
- Yeah.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.190
How long was I asleep for?

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.159
About four hours.

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.879
Aw. Sorry.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:08.759
So, listen. We've got plenty of euros,
we're in Barcelona,

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:13.357
I say we treat ourselves
to a nice hostel, warm showers.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.750
- What do you reckon?
- Oh, Joe.

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.832
You're crazy sometimes.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.320
How do I get down?

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:32.309
Joe, I must say
that it was really worth the money

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.400
going to that hostel.

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.880
- I feel so refreshed.
- Yeah, I know.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.314
You do have some good ideas.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:39.154
So nice. I don't have many good ideas
but when I do have a good idea,

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:41.391
it's normally good.

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.914
Anyway, before we set out on this trip,

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.639
I arranged to meet
a YouTuber called Mellow.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.713
But the only thing was I arranged
to meet her at 10:00 a.m. today.

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.439
But I don't have my phone
on me, have I?

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:50.954
Neither have you.
Director Brian's got them.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.040
I hate him.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:54.191
Hopefully, she'll be there to meet us.

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.476
- Where?
- Christopher Columbus statue?

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.755
- Where's that?
- I have no idea.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:58.956
So, just keep an eye on for it.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.397
- Christopher Columbus statue?
- Yeah.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.995
- Oh, wow, is that it?
- Oh, that's it. Yeah, that big old...

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.117
Christopher Columbus,
good old Chris.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.634
<i>Didn't he direct</i> Harry Potter?

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:21.076
<i>I thought it was</i> Titanic.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:25.680
Mellow?

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.399
- Hey, how you doing?
- Oh, Joe!

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:28.880
- Good to see you.
- How are you?

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.440
Hi, lovely to see you.

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.000
- How are you, dude?
- Sorry we're late.

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:35.630
I've been texting you for like
six days now, emailing, what happened?

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.120
I know, I'm so sorry.

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:39.032
- Basically, see this guy over here?
- Yeah.

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:42.511
That's Brian, the director.
He took our phones off us from day one.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.000
- So I couldn't reply. I'm so sorry.
- Oh.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:45.080
- He's a massive asshole.
- Yeah.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.160
Oh, okay.

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:48.232
I heard that you need
to earn some money, right?

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:50.471
- Yes. Oh, yeah.
- And that you're good at drawing.

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:53.359
Yeah, I've got an A-level in art,
but that was ages ago.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.318
Okay. I know some guys that, uh...

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:56.834
One does portrait

01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:58.752
- and the other one does caricature.
- Yeah.

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:02.550
And they're letting us use their
stand for an hour, if it's early.

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:03.994
- That sounds great.
- Awesome.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.834
So if you want to try, I mean,
you could earn some money. It's good.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.752
Sweet. Sounds good. Let's do it.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.788
I've known the artist
for about a year now.

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:23.272
And, well, he and his friend were
really happy to help the guys.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.120
I've got this.

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:31.277
Hello, so, okay,
what's your name, sorry?

01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:32.794
- Danielle.
- Danielle. I'm Joe.

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.075
I'll be drawing you today.

01:08:34.399 --> 01:08:36.118
Okay, let's get going.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:40.080
The first guy I met was a lovely dude
who... He's a programmer or something.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.152
He was really nice, very friendly.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.673
How long have you been doing this?

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:48.231
I can't remember but my earliest memory
was when I was three years old.

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:50.913
Keep very, very still.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.917
Just getting the measurements
of your head.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:56.750
I remember seeing people painting
and thinking, "How can I do that?"

01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:00.754
I spend more time looking at paper
than I do the real world, sometimes.

01:09:01.479 --> 01:09:03.392
You look very young, how old are you?

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:05.517
I'm actually 23.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.399
Yeah, I look very young for my age.
I think it's like an artist thing.

01:09:08.479 --> 01:09:11.917
I think, Joe, he tried, so...

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.274
You know.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:15.475
You've got a lot of hair.

01:09:16.279 --> 01:09:19.113
- Yes, it was longer.
- Oh, really? That's really nice.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.631
One of my customers
was a girl from Israel.

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:23.951
She was really sweet,
she had a beautiful smile.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.712
Um... And I kind of ruined it.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.154
You have very nice eyebrows.

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:30.595
Kind of like...
Do you know Cara Delevingne?

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.520
- What?
- The model?

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.273
- No.
- Very good eyebrows.

01:09:34.359 --> 01:09:36.555
Yeah, maybe went a little bit
too hard on the eyebrows

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.109
but I don't know,
I think eyebrows is a great thing.

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.919
As you've learnt from this trip,
it can get you really far.

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.430
It feels like the pencil's attached
to my body.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.876
But I travel the world doing art.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:49.158
Kind of cultural type of artistic style.

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:54.920
Right. I think I'm ready
to show this to you now.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.957
I think you're going to love it.
You're going to love this.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.520
This is a portrait of you.

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:03.710
What do you think?

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:11.911
Uh, I made her look
a little bit like the thing

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.356
from <i>Planet of the Apes,</i>
which wasn't good.

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.760
And you got a great smile.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.674
So, I thought I'd capture that.
And great eyes, great eyebrows.

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:21.434
Oh, wow.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.398
- That's awesome.
- Are you really happy with it?

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.233
I'm really happy with it.

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.755
Before I give it to you, I just have
to give it a little signy-sign.

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.593
Otherwise it's worth nothing.

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:31.831
Fifty. Yes!

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.674
I was really thankful that
the Israeli man gave me euros,

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.911
because, let's be honest
I'm not the best artist.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.151
When you look at this,
how does it make you feel?

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:41.038
That maybe I would like my money back?

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.800
<i>- Hola!
- Hola.</i>

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:48.473
How are you doing?

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:51.280
I'm, uh...
I'm going to be drawing you today.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:53.670
I don't know what his name was,
so I just called him Colin.

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.753
There was a bit of a language barrier.
But we got on really well.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.915
Where's the best places
to go out in Barcelona?

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.195
Barcelona.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.558
Where are the best, like, nightclubs?

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.074
- Holiday.
- Holiday.

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:14.397
We chatted about things like
Jägerbombs, nights out in Zante.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.517
I went to place called
Zante once in Greece

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.670
for a lads holiday.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.997
It's where I discovered the...
discovered Jägerbombs.

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:21.230
Do they have Jägerbombs out here?

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:25.513
Please, can you concentrate for
a second? I'm trying to work here.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.559
Your mum's paying good money for this.
I want you to concentrate, okay?

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:29.790
A little bit of maturity.

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.795
He's like my new best mate.
In fact, like...

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:38.635
If Caspar ever moves out, first person
I'll ask to be my roommate is that guy.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:41.235
I feel like this is kind of,
like, the sort of place where

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:43.033
you can really get absolutely bladdered.

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.793
Yeah, I'm a great artist.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.109
Look at me when I talk to you.

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:49.030
Have you ever been to, um,
Magaluf in Spain?

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.237
People throwing up in the street,

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.834
get into fights all the time.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:55.719
You would've loved it.
Just shots after shots, as well.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.878
Concentrate. Thank you. Thank you.

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:04.356
I think I will settle down at some point
in my life.

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:06.400
You're probably in the same boat,
we're just...

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.630
We're not at that stage yet,

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.473
we just need to go out and have fun.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.835
Have you ever had a house?

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:13.355
And you attached loads of balloons
to it, and you flew,

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:14.840
with a little, with a little Boy Scout

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.912
to South America to find a special bird?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.834
- Yes.
- I knew it! I knew I recognised you.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.036
Okay, that's good.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.032
Yeah, this is looking really good.
I'm very pleased with this.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.759
I'm just going to sign it.

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:28.155
What do you think?

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.552
You don't like it?
Stop shaking your head at me.

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.313
I'm right here, you don't have to rude.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.557
<i>Uno, dos, tres...</i>

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:39.594
Yeah!

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:43.597
My favourite moment was when the dog
jumped on me.

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:48.072
You're so cute, Freezer.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:50.914
You don't even have to pay me,
I love you. Aw!

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.515
The dog really loved Caspar.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.398
So, that was good.

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:58.120
I'm tired of working with humans,
I want to work with animals.

01:12:58.200 --> 01:12:59.680
He really liked the picture.

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:03.560
Oh, good.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.790
If you're ever in London,

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.439
we'll go for drinks
in Mahiki or somewhere.

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.680
Do you know these guys?

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:22.955
A friend of mine knows them.
He just sets them up.

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:24.520
- Oh, wow.
- She's got perfectly white teeth.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.353
Oh, it's a woman. Hello.

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:30.720
Thank you.

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:33.156
I don't want to alarm you
but I think your wife's dead.

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.959
That's not funny, Joe.

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.633
Just give him the money.

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.672
So, did you enjoy it?

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.717
- Yeah, it was really good.
- Yeah?

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.871
- Really enjoyed it.
- How much money did you make?

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.031
Uh... I made 60.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.157
I made 35, so, 95.

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.711
That's really good for an hour's work.
That's really good.

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.473
- Proud of you, Caspar.
- You're the man.

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.951
You're the man, no, you're the man.

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:02.032
Yeah, I'm quite annoyed
that I made less than him, though.

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:08.594
So, while you were doing the drawing,
um, I made some phone calls.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:09.680
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.479
That's something we can't do. Brian.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.790
I've got really nice jobs for you.

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:17.111
- Ooh, what are they?
- Really? Yeah, what is it?

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:19.954
I'm not going to say
but you'll find out.

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:39.951
Why is everyone staring at me?
This is so weird.

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.035
I'm looking at the moon.

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:05.109
I really need a wee.

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:11.070
Personally, I was
torn between two characters.

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:13.755
On one end,
I wanted to be the scary dragon,

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.275
but the other side of me
was still Caspar.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.199
Hello! Oh, you're so brave.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:22.272
Oh! There's a wasp in my eye.

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:24.113
To start with, I didn't really know
who I was, to be fair,

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:25.554
I was stood there like,
"Well, who am I supposed to be?"

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:27.996
Look at that.
That's my speciality, that is.

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:30.276
Did Galileo do this, in Galilean times?

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.510
Then, I really got into character.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.319
Have a look through there,
what do you see?

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.675
It's amazing that even with, like,

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:38.197
complete foreign,
like, language barrier,

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.476
all you need is a telescope,
then you're best friends.

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.153
- Wow.
- Yeah, it's good, isn't it?

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:46.120
It got to the point where I wasn't even
looking, I could just hear ching, ching,

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.237
into the pot, and I was thinking,
"Oh, this is good times.

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.192
"Someone's eating tonight."

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.634
Yeah, oh. Cheers, love.

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.759
Do you not find me, uh, scary?

01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.115
No.

01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:59.200
Sorry...

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:04.234
It really taught me
not to judge a book by its cover.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.397
Like I did when I met Joe.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.834
Hold my telescope for me, love.

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:11.480
Is that a <i>Joe and Caspar
Hit The Road</i> DVD?

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:13.631
Oh, yeah, it is.
Oh, my God, it's amazing. Wow.

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.636
Don't worry, I'm a nice guy.

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:17.915
My arm is really aching.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.071
You still looking at it?
That is the Milky Way.

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:22.072
I think Joe's character is a bit lame.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:23.719
Why are you nodding? That's not fair.

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.234
She's loving that. Look at that.

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.996
Oh, come on,
can't you be scared?

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:31.439
Hey!

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.196
- Tell me what you see.
- Eh, nothing.

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.272
Oh, yeah, I know.
It's pretty bad, isn't it?

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.517
All right, guys,
this is the moment of truth.

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:41.195
Let's find out how many Jägerbombs
we can buy tonight.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.480
Did you see that?

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.519
Yeah, buddy.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:51.640
Making it rain.

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:53.916
Mate, I reckon
there's well over 50 euros here.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.960
- It's got to be. Or near 50, easily.
- You think so? Bad.

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:01.192
Oh, with what we made earlier,
we're going to have a crazy night.

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.634
I'm so excited to treat the crew.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.393
It's going to be such a big party.

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:11.597
My head hurts.

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.911
That's the champagne talking, mate.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.832
Come on, wake up.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.389
That was... I'll tell you what, though,
that was a crew party.

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.480
Phwoar!

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:23.916
I can't believe how far we've come.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.195
This has been crazy.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:30.038
I kind of hate myself for saying this,
but I'm actually really proud of you.

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:31.349
- Really?
- Like, really proud.

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.352
You've done proper work.
How does it feel?

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.238
It feels weird
you saying something nice to me.

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.994
I know, it feels weird to me, too.
But, you know...

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.116
- It was fun.
- Proper jobs, proper money,

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.600
proper work, how does it feel?

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:44.754
Amazing. Like, Barcelona,
we were dressed up in, like, outfits,

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.151
I was a dragon,
scaring little kids and old ladies,

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.913
and it was really cool.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.595
<i>And the portrait painting,
Colin, the old man.</i>

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:54.911
Colin may have been cute, but my dog...

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:59.958
He was... Oh... I just wanted to
grab his little face and go...

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.269
Oh, my head. That really hurt my head.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.589
Sorry.

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:03.909
What else did we do?

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.276
- Oh, the boat!
- Yeah, Pascal.

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.635
- Pascal.
- What a legend.

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:10.275
<i>I can't believe...
I still remember his number in my head.</i>

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:13.478
<i>I'm usually really bad with numbers,
but because it was Pascal, I had to.</i>

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:14.960
<i>And that little weird red thing,</i>

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.918
<i>I don't even know what it was,
but it was bloomin' marvellous.</i>

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.192
- And his cars...
- Oh!

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.876
<i>I was a bit worried about you
with the cars for a few seconds,</i>

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.440
<i>you got quite obsessed.</i>

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:27.080
I didn't realise, but I love Katy.
Look at her. She's beautiful.

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.038
She is, isn't she?

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:33.273
I'll tell you what, Joe, in Milan,
you really cracked me up.

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.555
With the mascot kit.

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.040
Oh, I know, that was...

01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:38.510
I think this is hot,
that was twice as hot as this.

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.313
<i>- But you were so good at it.
- You're sweating now, right? Yeah.</i>

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:43.598
<i>You were like...
You were moonwalking and skateboarding.</i>

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:45.319
<i>I was skate boy, skate boy.</i>

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:47.915
<i>That's not even a word. Like skate boys.
Yeah. That's the one.</i>

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.070
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.560
<i>And then
when I gave you that T-shirt</i>

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:52.597
<i>and you got really angry
'cause it was so small</i>

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:54.239
<i>and you fell and hurt your knee.</i>

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.118
Yeah. It still hurts now.

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.316
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.880
- No, it's this one.
- Oh.

01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.189
It's fine. Don't touch it, it's fine.

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.119
<i>Hey, what about
the crew getting their kit off?</i>

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:04.920
<i>- At the model agency? Yeah.
- Yeah. That's the...</i>

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.072
That time, not the other four times,
but that time was really funny.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:12.154
For me, Verona was my favourite city,
'cause the whole thing was beautiful,

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.351
- not just certain parts.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:17.000
<i>- And the pizza. Marcello!
- Oh, yeah.</i>

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:18.355
<i>Marcello, the pizza.</i>

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:20.955
<i>I really want to meet more
Marcellos 'cause they're all awesome.</i>

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.509
<i>- And Anastasia, the opera singer.
- Yeah.</i>

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.353
<i>She... She definitely...
Have you spoke to her since?</i>

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:27.432
<i>No, I'm worried
that she's going to hurt me.</i>

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:29.796
Remember when we stopped off
at Lake Garda so I go for a dump?

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.793
And we saw the seagulls bonk.
I really enjoyed that.

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.631
<i>It's crazy to think that it all
started back in Venice, as well.</i>

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:39.315
<i>Yeah, with the
gondolas, and... And Julia.</i>

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:40.794
<i>- Julia!
- We really liked her.</i>

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.153
Oh, yeah. It's a passing phase, though.
I can't do long-distance, I can't.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.078
I'm sure she probably has
another boyfriend by now.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:49.391
Probably, yeah. And you falling in.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:51.597
Oh, my God.
You fell in the water.

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.990
<i>I really
actually didn't like that.</i>

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.116
Stop laughing.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.793
You know, meeting up with Greta
for ice cream...

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.473
Oh, my God! Oli!

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.474
How about I go get four ice creams?

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:04.153
I'll be two minutes.

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:07.680
Thirty minutes?

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:09.958
- An hour.
- Yeah.

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:11.880
Oh!

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:14.159
I was kind of
looking forward to an ice cream

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.959
but this is way better.

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:20.672
Guys?

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:22.558
Caspar?

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:25.917
Joe?

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.834
Oh, it's so hot in here.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.397
Go! Go.

01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:57.033
Are you sure
it's down here, Caspar?

01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.191
I've got a fourth sense about this.

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:01.192
I can... I remember that part.

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.158
I just really hope he's here.

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.072
- Oh, that street, yes.
- Yes.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.039
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.713
Oh, look at him.

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.032
Oh, God!

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:13.755
- Oli!
- Where have you guys been?

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:16.230
Mate...

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:17.390
What happened?

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:18.800
Where have you been?

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:21.839
I've been texting you for the last week
standing here with ice cream.

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:22.990
We weren't allowed
to use our phones, were we?

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:26.232
That was part of the challenge,
we weren't allowed to use any phones.

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:28.277
I don't care!
Do you know what kind of week I've had?

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:30.920
I've been outside
on that bench for a whole week.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.957
- Look, I've even lost a shoe.
- You've lost a shoe?

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.679
Yeah, a dog stole it.

01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:37.229
- And it's all over your hands.
- I know, I'm an absolute mess.

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.390
- I stink.
- You're gross.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:41.154
I know. No, you guys aren't friends.
You are not good friends.

01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:43.072
- Come on, let's get you home. Come on.
- It's time to go home.

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:46.153
- Can I go in the front?
- Absolutely no way. You stink.

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:47.310
Joe! Come on, please.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:48.470
Come on, get in the back.
Get in the back.

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.153
- Oh...
- Come on. We fixed the DVD player.

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:51.240
Oh, yes.

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:52.720
Your journey home will be fine.
Get in there.

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:55.797
Right, what DVD are we going to watch?

01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:58.076
<i>- Into the Blue.</i>
- And don't spill it on the floor.

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:02.234
Oh, it's already... Sorry, Joe.
It's already on the floor.

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:05.552
Oh, it's on my shoe! My only shoe.
It's on my shoe as well!

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.555
To be fair, though, Oli,
we did go to some pretty amazing places.

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.756
- Where did we go?
- You would have loved it.

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:14.675
Verona, Milan, Cannes, Barcelona.

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:15.760
We went everywhere.

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.035
- Yeah, guess where I was?
- Where?

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:18.839
Sitting on a bench
with some soggy ice creams.

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:21.953
At least you've got
a big old beard on you now.

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:23.633
Yeah, and at least
I lost a shoe by a dog.

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.916
You know what I feel like?
That beard really defines your face.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000
- It's nice.
- Really?

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:29.675
Did you meet any interesting
people on the streets of Venice?

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:31.399
Yeah, I made
a couple of good friends.

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:32.709
Uh, probably wouldn't
hang out with them again

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.120
but yeah, it was interesting.

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:35.919
Did you learn any Italian?

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.116
Uh, no...

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:06.760
I hope you guys enjoyed the film!

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.160
We enjoyed making it so much

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:11.551
and just wanted to thank the first
8,000 people who pre-ordered it.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:14.997
Yeah, and your names will be up
in the credits right now.
