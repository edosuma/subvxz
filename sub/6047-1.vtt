23:14.733 --> 23:17.480
it but we haven't had time.
Why?

23:18.397 --> 23:20.399
No reason.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.363
Okay.

24:08.989 --> 24:11.708

24:49.905 --> 24:53.330
David!

24:59.790 --> 25:01.633
<i>(Loud scream)</i>

25:03.085 --> 25:05.712
Oh, God! David,
there's someone out there!

25:05.713 --> 25:07.181
Honey, there's
someone out there.

25:07.182 --> 25:10.517
There's a man in a
hood just down there.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.274
There's nobody out here.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.602
I saw someone.

25:19.685 --> 25:22.279
Okay. If he comes back
I'll be on him, okay?

25:22.280 --> 25:25.523
Wait. You don't believe me?

25:25.524 --> 25:27.400
I didn't say that.
No, it's...

25:27.401 --> 25:29.654
Look, it's a new house,
middle of nowhere,

25:29.655 --> 25:32.864
it's creepy outside.
You're expecting...

25:32.865 --> 25:37.871
We're expecting and you know...

25:38.245 --> 25:40.794
You went off those meds.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.922
That's what happens.

25:45.461 --> 25:48.135
Come on.
There's nothing.

25:48.589 --> 25:50.506
Come to bed.

25:50.507 --> 25:51.929
(Sadie) You are not crazy.

25:51.930 --> 25:55.720
Think of all the tweakers
running around this area.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.805
It just... it felt so real.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.852
You have to listen
to your intuition.

25:59.853 --> 26:03.525
And who knows? Maybe it could be
your mommy sense kicking in.

26:03.526 --> 26:06.522
Oh, mommy sense.
Is that like Spidey sense?

26:06.523 --> 26:07.398
Kind of.

26:07.399 --> 26:10.239
One time, when I was a baby,
my sister was giving me a bath

26:10.240 --> 26:12.737
and left me in there with the
water running and my morn was

26:12.738 --> 26:15.410
downstairs running the vacuum,
obviously couldn't hear

26:15.411 --> 26:17.909
anything. But she just
got this feeling, you know?

26:17.910 --> 26:21.414
She ran upstairs and there I
was, underwater, drowning.

26:21.415 --> 26:24.633
She just knew.
Mommy sense.

26:24.792 --> 26:29.844
Yeah, it's mommy sense, or
it's something more than that.

26:31.757 --> 26:35.807
I was in a car accident
about a year ago.

26:36.261 --> 26:39.356
They said it wasn't my fault,
but there was a mother and a

26:39.357 --> 26:42.272
baby in the other car and...

26:43.393 --> 26:46.021
the baby didn't make it.

26:48.023 --> 26:49.440
I'm so sorry.

26:49.441 --> 26:52.401
That's so awful.
Jesus Christ.

26:52.402 --> 26:55.154
I tried to reach out to the
other family but they didn't

26:55.155 --> 26:59.617
take my calls, and I
can't say I blame them.

26:59.618 --> 27:03.913
Anyway, then David put me on
an antidepressant because well,

27:03.914 --> 27:05.757
I felt like I
was losing my mind.

27:05.758 --> 27:09.710
Obviously, that stopped once
I found out I was pregnant.

27:09.711 --> 27:10.428
Yes. Good. I'm glad.

27:10.429 --> 27:13.845
You shouldn't be putting those
chemicals into your body anyway.

27:13.846 --> 27:15.174
I know.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.931
Is not your fault.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.649
Thank you for being a friend.

27:22.650 --> 27:26.111
How 'bout I get you a
chocolate mousse, huh?

27:26.687 --> 27:29.031
I'd have a cookie.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.044
David?

28:04.349 --> 28:06.477

28:10.147 --> 28:12.064

28:13.233 --> 28:15.443

28:15.444 --> 28:17.486
Who is it?
Who's there?

28:50.062 --> 28:50.900
Oh, David. David.

28:50.901 --> 28:52.273
What happened?
What's going on?

28:52.274 --> 28:54.732
The wine bottles just exploded!

28:54.733 --> 28:56.485
What?

28:58.028 --> 29:00.156
What're you talking about?

29:00.864 --> 29:02.616
They just...

29:03.992 --> 29:04.951
They...

29:04.952 --> 29:08.877
And there was...
there was a gun over there.

29:12.918 --> 29:16.462
David, there was a
goddamn gun there!

29:16.463 --> 29:18.465
<i>(Bonks on door)</i>

29:22.469 --> 29:25.096
(Leo) Hey, David.
- Hi. Come on in.

29:25.097 --> 29:28.307
Honey, this is Leo Cottrell.
He lives down the road.

29:28.308 --> 29:28.808
Hello.

29:28.809 --> 29:30.980
You know, when we talked
the other day, I realized

29:30.981 --> 29:34.278
I was just way overdue
to stop by and say hello.

29:34.279 --> 29:38.442
(David) Yeah, Leo runs a a
artisanal olive oil business.

29:38.443 --> 29:39.777
Right?
- Yeah.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.621
We were talking about it
and I just don't want any

29:41.622 --> 29:44.535
misunderstandings. You guys
should come by and check it out.

29:44.536 --> 29:47.377
Okay. Thanks for stopping by.
Appreciate it.

29:47.378 --> 29:49.954
Yeah, yeah!
See you guys around.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.832
All right.

29:54.084 --> 29:56.127
I know what I saw.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.880
I know.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.303
(David) This isn't
just seeing things.

30:02.304 --> 30:05.271
These are major hallucinations
we're talking about.

30:05.272 --> 30:07.888
The hooded guy, a gun?

30:07.889 --> 30:10.483
(Dr. Mathison) This is what we
discussed, Eveleigh. Your

30:10.484 --> 30:15.438
pregnant body is basically a
cocktail of competing hormones.

30:15.439 --> 30:17.148
I'm not taking any drugs.

30:17.149 --> 30:20.115
But you were on medication for
nearly half a year after the

30:20.116 --> 30:23.451
accident and it could help
you deal with your symptoms.

30:23.452 --> 30:26.073
And I felt like a zombie
and I wasn't pregnant.

30:26.074 --> 30:28.326
There are very few side effects
with this. You don't need

30:28.327 --> 30:32.044
to worry about that. This is
a very common antidepressant.

30:32.045 --> 30:33.878
But I'm not depressed.
And we don't know for

30:33.879 --> 30:36.593
sure there are zero side
effects. Nobody knows.

30:36.594 --> 30:40.463
(David) Evey,
we can't live like this.

30:40.464 --> 30:42.214
I can't live like this.

30:42.215 --> 30:44.809
I want you to promise me
that if you have one more

30:44.810 --> 30:48.054
hallucination, you go
back on your medication.

30:48.055 --> 30:51.980
David, we have to put
the baby first now.

30:56.063 --> 30:57.736
(David) I'm gonna give this
a minute to open up.

30:57.737 --> 31:01.702
(Ben) I'm not sure I ever drank
anything that needed to open up.

31:01.703 --> 31:03.110
Drunk. Whatever.

31:03.111 --> 31:06.781
We're on more of a Two Buck
Chuck budget ourselves.

31:06.782 --> 31:07.624
(David) That's all right.

31:07.625 --> 31:10.582
So, when are you gonna get
this winery up and running?

31:10.583 --> 31:13.374
We're close. The problem
out here though is rain.

31:13.375 --> 31:16.250
The vines really should have
shoots by now but I've been

31:16.251 --> 31:19.547
bringing in two water trucks
a week since we took over.

31:19.548 --> 31:21.217
Water trucks, that sucks.

31:21.218 --> 31:25.841
Isn't this supposed to be like
the worst drought in decades?

31:25.842 --> 31:28.719
(Sadie) Okay, maybe
don't rub it in, Ben.

31:28.720 --> 31:29.765
- Just sayin'.
- It's OK.

31:29.766 --> 31:32.733
(Ben) What about you, Eveleigh?
How do you like the place?

31:32.734 --> 31:34.100
(David) Evey.

31:34.101 --> 31:36.149
Sorry, what?

31:36.895 --> 31:39.023
She's been a little out
of it recently, so...

31:39.024 --> 31:44.199
Well, imagine how out of it I'll
be when I'm medicated, David.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.116
Sorry, I didn't mean
to ruin the vibe.

31:46.117 --> 31:49.740
But you can't take
medication, you're pregnant!

31:49.741 --> 31:50.533
Thank you.

31:50.534 --> 31:53.327
Ben, why don't I
show you the winery?

31:53.328 --> 31:55.751
I think the ladies
have had enough of us.

31:55.752 --> 31:57.456
Yeah. Yeah.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.666
I'm sorry.

31:58.667 --> 31:59.667
Don't wander off too far.

31:59.668 --> 32:02.137
We don't want to send
a search party for you.

32:02.138 --> 32:04.004
Yes, your majesty.

32:04.005 --> 32:06.633
I'm sorry I just did that.

32:07.342 --> 32:08.343
No.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.179
Ben seems sweet.

32:12.180 --> 32:15.184
Yeah. I think he's a keeper.

32:15.851 --> 32:18.650
Sorry, I don't mean to pry,
but what is this about

32:18.651 --> 32:20.896
putting you on medication?

32:20.897 --> 32:22.273
Antidepressants.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.447
No, you can't let
them do that to you.

32:26.570 --> 32:28.664
What do you think?

32:30.615 --> 32:32.458
I think there is
something wrong here,

32:32.459 --> 32:35.330
and I don't think
I'm imagining it.

32:37.456 --> 32:38.795
That's your mommy sense.

32:38.796 --> 32:41.464
Right now, your protective
instincts they're at an all

32:41.465 --> 32:45.588
time high so, if something
happened in this house you're

32:45.589 --> 32:47.798
way more receptive to it.

32:47.799 --> 32:48.470
What do you mean?

32:48.471 --> 32:53.940
I mean-I think this
house might be haunted.

32:55.348 --> 32:58.851
(Glenn) Well, I'm disappointed
that the house isn't living

32:58.852 --> 32:59.692
up to your expectations.

32:59.693 --> 33:01.173
That's the understatement
of the year.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.112
Is to know about the vineyard.

33:05.113 --> 33:08.988
Hm-mm. Yeah, I did every search
I could think of. Police logs,

33:08.989 --> 33:12.948
real estate disclosures
and there is nothing.

33:12.949 --> 33:15.701
No history of violence, natural
disasters, agricultural

33:15.702 --> 33:19.663
accidents or any event that
might be at the root of your

33:19.664 --> 33:20.915
paranormal activity.

33:20.916 --> 33:23.010
I'm actually surprised to hear
you complain because most people

33:23.011 --> 33:25.880
would love to be able to say
that their house was haunted by

33:25.881 --> 33:30.885
the spirits of the old wine
makers-blah, blah, blah.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.310
It adds to the romance.

33:32.311 --> 33:35.095
What about the ruins,
behind the house?

33:35.096 --> 33:37.190
It looked like there used
to be a big old house there.

33:37.191 --> 33:41.185
Going back 80 years, nothing
that I could see, no.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.814
It's been zoned for agriculture
the entire time until the

33:43.815 --> 33:46.362
Porters got their building
permit to convert the stable

33:46.363 --> 33:49.360
into a house.
Try looking them up.

33:49.361 --> 33:52.613
That would be my recommendation.

33:52.614 --> 33:55.788
It's been a pleasure, ladies,
and you let me know if I can do

33:55.789 --> 33:58.754
any more ghostbusting for you.

It was terrifying.

playing in a neighbor's house.

Sometimes your eyes and ears

you're alone for too
long. Look, I just think

36:10.669 --> 36:11.964
Hey, honey.
How was today?

36:11.965 --> 36:14.088
I replaced all the posts
on the north slope.

36:14.089 --> 36:17.263
I had to chase off some
more of those raccoons, too.

36:17.264 --> 36:18.634
What're you up to?

36:18.635 --> 36:22.429
I just spoke to Eileen
and she's off to Paris.

36:22.430 --> 36:25.352
Honey, how much do you
know about the Porters?

36:25.353 --> 36:27.142
Not much,
guy's in prison. Why?

36:27.143 --> 36:28.986
Don't you think it's weird that
we don't know anything about

36:28.987 --> 36:31.193
the people that lived
in this house before us,

36:31.194 --> 36:32.528
what might have happened here?

36:32.529 --> 36:34.400
Not really.
What's going on?

36:34.401 --> 36:37.986
What if what I'm
feeling is not PTSD

36:37.987 --> 36:43.585
and it's not hormonal,
and it's something else.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.628
Like what?

36:45.954 --> 36:49.254
Something supernatural.

36:53.378 --> 36:54.712
I don't know.

36:54.713 --> 36:55.838
Sweetheart, let's
not even go there.

36:55.839 --> 36:57.136
That's the last thing
you need right now.

36:57.137 --> 37:01.218
David, what if something
terrible happened back in the

37:01.219 --> 37:02.641
days of the old house?

37:02.642 --> 37:06.557
So, like what, it's a ghost
that only you can see?

37:06.558 --> 37:08.481
Maybe because of my pregnancy.

37:08.482 --> 37:12.856
Maybe I'm getting I don't
know, a sixth sense.

37:13.398 --> 37:14.523
Listen to me for a second.

37:14.524 --> 37:16.572
You went through something
really tragic last year and

37:16.573 --> 37:21.071
that would be traumatic for
anyone, sweetheart and you have

Let me go and get that.

59:54.299 --> 59:56.095
My great grandmother
was a tough cookie and

59:56.096 --> 59:59.097
she wasn't gonna let go of
the house easily so she hired

59:59.098 --> 01:00:02.350
a medium to cleanse the place.

01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:09.605
Now, the story goes...

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:13.279
is that the medium went into
a trance to try to contact

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.028
the spirits that were
trapped in the house.

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:20.500
And these are some of
the sketches she did.

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:55.952
David!

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:01.037

living in the house.

What're you talking about?

me and get out of the house.
