-Templeton, when I allow Mommy and Daddy

to "get me," that's a choice.
It amuses me.

you're not really the boss.

you're just a baby.

Thank you, sir.

That's why we're number one.

It just wants to be loved, too.

06:14.749 --> 06:20.213
Does that make it the enemy? Yes.
And that is why we crushed Puppy Co.

-Yeah!
-Killing it, Staci.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.758
This meeting is making me uncomfortable.

06:23.841 --> 06:26.803
But at least puppies
were an enemy with honor.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.221
See the kitten?

is so you'll let your guard down.

Do you really just let Mommy and Daddy
fix everything for you?

07:04.590 --> 07:05.425

No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

07:20.773 --> 07:23.860
He was on our doorstep.
Must've gotten lost.

07:23.943 --> 07:27.321
That's so weird.
A tag, but no address or owner?

07:27.405 --> 07:30.908
-Just "Gaa-gaa"?
-Weird name for a cat.

-Bootsy Calico.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.506

07:45.923 --> 07:49.385
Okay. The vet says he can find a home
in a few weeks.

07:49.469 --> 07:54.932
In the meantime, he thinks it's a great
idea for us to foster our lost kitty.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.767
-[Boss Baby sputters]
-Oh, of course.

07:56.851 --> 08:01.189
We'll call him Little Nugget,
and we promise we won't get too attached.

08:02.440 --> 08:06.235
Hey, for no reason,
do you guys have that vet's address?

08:09.155 --> 08:11.574
Why are we going to the vet?
Think I can get him

08:11.657 --> 08:13.951
-to foster that kitten somewhere else?
-Hmm? What?

08:14.035 --> 08:15.953
Oh, no. I just want revenge.

-[thumps]
-Ow!

08:17.830 --> 08:19.165
Vengeance!

08:19.582 --> 08:21.459
Now, the only remaining question is,

08:21.542 --> 08:25.379
why is this Bootsy Calico kitten
inside my house?

08:25.463 --> 08:29.342
Answer: the classic
"cat's in the cradle" gambit.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.178
Out with baby, in with kitty.

08:32.261 --> 08:36.766
Little Bootsy's trying to replace me
in my own home.

So you can't show up for work on time,

08:39.769 --> 08:43.314
and you've got a kitty-kitty cat
taking your place at home?

08:43.397 --> 08:47.151
You're not just not a boss.
You're not even a good baby.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.236
[laughing]

08:49.362 --> 08:54.158
So are you calling for help from a real
executive baby who hasn't gone soft?

08:54.242 --> 08:55.660
Because I'm one of those.

08:55.743 --> 09:00.456
No, I'm calling to set the table for how
breathtaking my victory will be later.

09:00.623 --> 09:03.292
And to get the last word.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.044

-Last word!

-No, no. It doesn't help now.

he's still a boss.

[lapping]

09:27.650 --> 09:32.363
You think you can come here in my home,
steal my love?

09:32.446 --> 09:35.783
No, no, no, no. Not on my watch, kitty.

09:35.866 --> 09:40.246
You're not kicking me out.
I'm kicking you out. Winner take all.

09:40.329 --> 09:45.376

of this house first, stays out. For good.

09:45.459 --> 09:46.460
[Tim] What?

09:46.544 --> 09:50.673
That is an insane contest!
Why would you even offer that?

09:50.756 --> 09:53.426
-You don't think I can win?
-That's not what I'm saying.

09:53.509 --> 09:54.969
[squeaking] Meow. Meow.

09:55.177 --> 09:59.223
I can't tell if you're agreeing to terms
or swearing at me.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.976
-Meow.
-I'll take it as a yes. Deal.

10:02.059 --> 10:06.188
May the cutest baby win.
Jimbo, please stop petting the cat.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.315
Sorry, boss.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.900
How're you gonna get him kicked out
of the house?

10:09.984 --> 10:13.654
I'm a baby, Staci.
And he's just a household pet.

10:13.738 --> 10:18.200
I just give Mommy and Daddy a choice:
"Whom do you love more?"

11:03.371 --> 11:04.914
[mimics slicing]

11:04.997 --> 11:08.042
I really think I should tell Mom and Dad.

11:08.125 --> 11:11.170
Even if I wanted to,
that's a terrible idea.

11:11.253 --> 11:14.131
Have I told you why Baby Corp
operates in secret?

11:14.215 --> 11:18.010
The company ran some research trials
in Pittsburgh a few years back.

11:18.094 --> 11:21.722
Showed a mommy and daddy the truth
about what Baby Corp does.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.642
It snapped their brains

Now, how do I get this cat kicked out
of my house?

-Ideas. Go.
-[giggles]

11:50.084 --> 11:52.128

-Not an idea. Staci.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.547
What if you broke stuff
and blamed the cat?

11:54.630 --> 11:58.592
Yes. That's the A-game we need.
Gold star for Staci.

11:58.676 --> 12:01.011
In fairness, the cat thought of it first.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.847

12:44.930 --> 12:48.350
Oh, the kitten was playing football
in the living room?

12:48.434 --> 12:50.311
-What?
-[faint tap]

You don't have to go. We can fix this.

-[Staci] Yay!

13:40.611 --> 13:42.905
Did your plan have to include
getting me in trouble?

13:42.988 --> 13:44.573
-Sure. Let's say it did.
-Meow.

13:45.407 --> 13:46.575

13:46.659 --> 13:49.370
Gracious in defeat. I respect that.

My baby brother won.

Cats are anarchists.
They don't play by rules.

That felt good. Thanks for waiting.

14:36.333 --> 14:40.045
Now, what do we do about the cat?
One time when I was in daycare,

14:40.129 --> 14:43.924
a boy kept chasing me, so I told him
to meet me at the slide.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.885
But when he went, I wasn't there.

14:45.968 --> 14:50.848
I was back in his cubbyhole,
filling his lunchbox with centipedes.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.224
[chuckles]

14:52.433 --> 14:55.644
-That's unhelpful, and you terrify me.
-I love that story.

14:55.728 --> 14:59.106
Templeton, you like imagining things.
Imagine me a solution.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.524
Ooh, good idea.

15:01.483 --> 15:04.111
[Tim] There we were, underground,

15:04.194 --> 15:09.325

-That's your plan?
-We have to get Mom and Dad.

15:28.469 --> 15:31.889
-Why?!
-Because that's what kids do.

15:31.972 --> 15:35.976
And you are just a baby!

15:38.354 --> 15:40.898
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.150

This is my fight.

Staci, Jimbo, thank you for your service.
Vaya con baby Dios.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.124
Wait! What are you doing?

There's an extra "a" in the second "gaa."

Not "gaa." It's "gaaa."
That changes the whole meaning.

-That's not the full message.
