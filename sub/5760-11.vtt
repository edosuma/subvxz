00:07.401 --> 00:10.301
My name
is melinda gordon.

00:11.467 --> 00:12.900
I just got married,

00:12.967 --> 00:16.033
just moved to a small town,
just opened up an antique shop.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.900
I might be just like you.

00:18.967 --> 00:20.900
Except from the time
that i was a little girl,

00:20.967 --> 00:23.067
i knew that i could
talk to the dead.

00:24.134 --> 00:25.367
Grandmother:
It's all right, honey.

00:25.434 --> 00:27.900
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them,

00:27.967 --> 00:30.234
the ones who have not
crossed over

00:30.301 --> 00:32.534
because they have unfinished
business with the living,

00:32.601 --> 00:34.767
and they come
to me for help.

00:34.833 --> 00:38.067
To tell you my story,
i have to tell you theirs.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

01:02.034 --> 01:04.833
Double jab cross.
Ok.

01:04.900 --> 01:06.034
Double jab cross!

01:06.100 --> 01:07.501
Stay on top of him.
Stay on top of him!

01:07.568 --> 01:08.934
Be first! Be first!

01:09.000 --> 01:10.100
1, 2, 1, 2.

01:10.167 --> 01:12.668
Get inside... and time!

01:14.467 --> 01:16.833
Nice work,
nice work, nice work.

01:16.900 --> 01:19.401
Hey, teo, don't make me
come up there and show
you how it's done, huh?

01:19.467 --> 01:21.000
Keep dreaming.

01:21.067 --> 01:23.100
What's going on?
We selling those tickets?

01:23.167 --> 01:25.167
We had to print more.

01:25.234 --> 01:28.034
I'm gonna go hit up
the ladies in the
self-defense class.

01:28.100 --> 01:31.800
Nice. Ladies.
My new target audience.

01:31.867 --> 01:32.800
Hah!
Hah!

01:32.867 --> 01:34.733
And again, and attack!

01:34.800 --> 01:35.967
Hah!
Hah!

01:36.034 --> 01:38.534
Ok. I can't wait
to see you all
next time.

01:38.601 --> 01:42.301
Ladies, don't forget,
next saturday,
it's fight night

01:42.367 --> 01:44.867
right here
in our own beautiful
village square.

01:44.934 --> 01:46.434
It's our own
teo de la costa

01:46.501 --> 01:48.301
vs. Jackie o'callahan
from centerville.

01:48.367 --> 01:50.634
I have to tell you,
i do not get boxing.

01:50.700 --> 01:53.301
2 guys hit each
other over and over
again on purpose

01:53.367 --> 01:54.534
until one of them
falls down.

01:54.601 --> 01:56.367
Oh, well,
it's quicker than football.

01:56.434 --> 01:59.634
All the proceeds
go right to the firehouse
reconstruction project, too.

01:59.700 --> 02:00.733
So, i'll see you
at the store?

02:00.800 --> 02:01.733
Mm-hmm.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.067
Oh, bring coffee?

02:03.134 --> 02:05.367
Of course. Muffin?

02:05.434 --> 02:06.733
I think
i've earned it.
Pumpkin.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.467
Ooh! Done!

02:08.533 --> 02:09.800
Girls, stone cold.

02:09.866 --> 02:12.334
Ho ho! That's right.
Hey.

02:12.401 --> 02:15.501
Hey, come on.
I want you to
meet teo.

02:16.800 --> 02:17.767
Uhh!

02:17.833 --> 02:20.034
Teo, sorry to interrupt.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.167
I wanted to introduce
you to my wife.

02:22.234 --> 02:23.334
Mrs. Clancy,
it's a pleasure.

02:23.401 --> 02:26.467
Mrs. Clancy
is my mother-in-law.

02:26.534 --> 02:28.201
Please,
just call me melinda.

02:28.267 --> 02:30.167
Melinda.

02:30.234 --> 02:32.201
That's what
i taught him.

02:32.267 --> 02:34.700
Never to
call a grownup
by their first name

02:34.767 --> 02:36.000
unless
given permission.

02:36.067 --> 02:40.601
Um... just one thing,
though.

02:40.668 --> 02:42.401
Do you think you could
take a dive in the eighth,

02:42.467 --> 02:44.201
'cause i got a couple
hundred bucks on o'callahan.

02:44.267 --> 02:45.401
You made a bad bet,
my friend.

02:45.467 --> 02:46.467
Take a dive.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.467
My son would never
do such a thing.

02:50.167 --> 02:51.867
It was a joke.

02:51.934 --> 02:53.167
No, no,
it's not a joke.

02:53.234 --> 02:54.634
I gotta cover
all my bases.

02:54.700 --> 02:55.800
You're crazy, dude.

02:55.867 --> 02:57.434
All right.
Do what you do best.

02:57.501 --> 02:58.434
I'll check you later.

02:58.501 --> 02:59.833
All right.

02:59.900 --> 03:01.501
Hey, jim.
What's up, baby?
How you doin'?

03:01.568 --> 03:03.334
[Speaking spanish]

03:03.401 --> 03:05.668
My spanish is
a little rusty.

03:05.733 --> 03:08.568
Can you see me?

03:08.634 --> 03:10.367
Come on.

03:10.434 --> 03:13.201
Something terrible has
happened to my family.

03:13.777 --> 03:16.777
???

03:59.251 --> 04:01.051
i know you can see me.

04:01.117 --> 04:03.483
I know. I can
tell by the way

04:03.550 --> 04:05.851
you're pretending
not to see me.

04:05.917 --> 04:07.851
Not here. I can't
talk to you here.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.350
Can you see me now?

04:16.151 --> 04:17.617
Ok, new policy.

04:17.684 --> 04:19.951
No more talking
to ghosts in public.

04:20.017 --> 04:23.084
Too many people staring,
and nobody is buying
the cell phone excuse.

04:23.151 --> 04:24.984
Is this some kind
of stream of
consciousness thing

04:25.051 --> 04:26.483
you picked up
in yoga class?

04:27.817 --> 04:30.084
Oh, um, ok. Su...
uh...

04:30.151 --> 04:31.851
i'll be
in the back room

04:31.917 --> 04:34.184
doing some stuff.

04:36.917 --> 04:38.517
You have to help me.

04:38.584 --> 04:40.350
With what?
My husband.

04:40.417 --> 04:43.984
He was always
with my son, always
watching over him,

04:44.051 --> 04:47.884
protecting him,
and now they're not even
talking to each other,

04:47.951 --> 04:49.284
and i don't know why.

04:49.350 --> 04:51.017
Do you know when
they stopped talking
to each other?

04:51.084 --> 04:52.184
Was it before you died?

04:52.251 --> 04:53.617
I don't remember.

04:53.684 --> 04:56.084
All the medicine
that they gave me
made me so foggy.

04:56.151 --> 04:57.450
Do you remember
your name?

04:57.517 --> 04:59.717
Oh. I'm so sorry. Yes.

04:59.784 --> 05:01.984
My name is
estella de la costa.

05:02.051 --> 05:03.517
Estella,
let me be honest.

05:03.584 --> 05:05.051
I think this is
a domestic problem

05:05.117 --> 05:06.851
between 2 living people,

05:06.917 --> 05:08.383
and they need to work it
out for themselves.

05:08.450 --> 05:10.017
It's not really what
i do. Hi.

05:10.084 --> 05:11.951
So, then,
what do you do?

05:12.017 --> 05:13.951
I help people
cross over.

05:14.017 --> 05:16.383
I cannot even think
about cross over

05:16.450 --> 05:18.784
before i know
what happened to them.

05:18.851 --> 05:21.550
Look, i'm sorry.
Family disputes are
none of my business.

05:21.617 --> 05:22.817
This is something
you need to make peace
with and move...

05:22.884 --> 05:25.017
it's not
a family dispute.

05:25.084 --> 05:26.218
It's not that simple.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.550
It can't be.
[Bells on door
jingle]

05:27.617 --> 05:30.717
They just love
each other so much.

05:30.784 --> 05:32.151
Oh, hi.

05:43.251 --> 05:45.550
Just once, i wish
one of those ghosts
following you around

05:45.617 --> 05:47.251
would actually
buy something.

05:57.784 --> 06:00.750
Ok. I don't understand
something about you.

06:00.817 --> 06:03.218
Plain pizza?

06:03.284 --> 06:07.184
Uhh! You don't like
anything on it at all?

06:07.251 --> 06:08.750
I'm a purist.

06:08.817 --> 06:11.517
You, mr. Gourmet cook,
and you have naked pizza.

06:11.584 --> 06:13.218
That is just indecent.

06:13.284 --> 06:15.951
As soon as you
put meat and fish and
pineapple on a pizza,

06:16.017 --> 06:18.617
it's not pizza anymore.
It's frankenpizza.

06:18.684 --> 06:19.817
It's unnatural,

06:19.884 --> 06:22.483
and actually, it's
insulting to the pizza.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.717
Now you're saying
i'm insulting pizza?

06:24.784 --> 06:25.984
I'm surprised it's
even speaking to you.

06:27.084 --> 06:29.284
You need help.
I am begging you

06:29.350 --> 06:31.251
to get help
for that whole thing.

06:31.318 --> 06:33.318
All right.
Ha ha ha ha!

06:33.383 --> 06:35.884
I met someone
interesting today.

06:35.951 --> 06:37.550
Should i be jealous?

06:37.617 --> 06:39.650
A living person?

06:39.717 --> 06:41.117
Oh, right.
Of course not.

06:41.184 --> 06:42.650
How could that be
interesting?

06:42.717 --> 06:44.117
Teo's mother.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.450
No kidding.

06:48.517 --> 06:50.251
You know anything
about the family at all?

06:50.318 --> 06:53.550
Not really. Well,
his dad used to train
him at that gym,

06:53.617 --> 06:56.117
but he hasn't been
around for a long time.

06:56.184 --> 06:59.251
Well, apparently,
he hasn't talked to
his dad in a long time,

06:59.318 --> 07:00.784
and his mom
doesn't know why.

07:03.218 --> 07:04.450
What happened to her?

07:04.517 --> 07:06.951
I don't know.
She doesn't know.

07:07.017 --> 07:08.117
I don't know if
there's anything i can do.

07:08.184 --> 07:10.417
I mean,
i want to help her,

07:10.483 --> 07:13.218
but then, am i
getting involved in
their family business?

07:13.284 --> 07:14.383
Yeah.

07:14.450 --> 07:15.450
I just feel
like i have to start

07:15.517 --> 07:17.318
setting some boundaries,
you know?

07:17.383 --> 07:18.584
What do you think?

07:18.650 --> 07:19.951
That's a tough call,

07:20.017 --> 07:22.117
because when you
start talking
about boundaries,

07:22.184 --> 07:24.084
i start thinking about
uninterrupted dinners,

07:24.151 --> 07:26.483
nights at the movies,
and weekends
out of town, and...

07:26.550 --> 07:28.650
right.
Am i a bad person?

07:28.717 --> 07:31.051
No. Because then i
start thinking about
teo and his dad,

07:31.117 --> 07:34.184
and they used to be
at that gym 24/7.

07:34.251 --> 07:37.084
I mean, his dad was
training him to get
ready for the olympics.

07:37.151 --> 07:39.951
Well, the least i can do
is let teo talk to his mom

07:40.017 --> 07:41.784
and see if she can
get them back together.

07:41.851 --> 07:42.984
Right, yeah.

07:44.218 --> 07:46.318
Hey, i think one
of your anchovies

07:46.383 --> 07:48.951
is violating
the air space of my
perfectly plain pizza.

07:49.017 --> 07:51.218
Embrace the anchovy.
Embrace it.

07:51.284 --> 07:52.483
Come on, do it.

07:52.550 --> 07:53.851
You need help.
You know you want to.

07:53.917 --> 07:55.483
I'll embrace it.
You think
i need help?

07:55.550 --> 07:57.318
This is me,
embracing it.

07:57.383 --> 07:58.550
Ooh!
Oh, my god.

07:58.617 --> 07:59.750
It's alive.

07:59.817 --> 08:01.151
Out, demon.

08:01.218 --> 08:02.650
Ha ha ha!

08:39.116 --> 08:41.383
You need
a sparring partner?

08:41.450 --> 08:44.517
No way. I'd definitely
be outclassed by you.

08:44.584 --> 08:47.084
Oh, it's true.
I am undefeated
in my weight class.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.550
Ha ha ha ha!

08:48.617 --> 08:49.917
Did i interrupt?

08:49.984 --> 08:52.784
No. Melinda, right?

08:52.851 --> 08:54.184
Right.

08:54.251 --> 08:55.984
Everyone's
really excited
about the fight.

08:56.051 --> 08:57.584
Yeah? Good.

08:57.650 --> 08:58.917
It's gonna be
a good one.

08:58.984 --> 09:01.117
Do you ever get scared
in the ring?

09:01.184 --> 09:03.350
I mean, when somebody's
coming at you like that,
attacking you?

09:03.417 --> 09:04.684
I look forward to it.

09:04.750 --> 09:07.684
Oh. 'cause i get
scared when i
have to fend off

09:07.750 --> 09:11.584
a 70-year-old woman
named edith in my
self-defense class.

09:11.650 --> 09:14.251
You know, even
if you're afraid,
you should never show it.

09:14.318 --> 09:17.350
If you let your opponent
sense your fear,
then you're done.

09:17.417 --> 09:19.517
The first question
i ask every time
i step in the ring,

09:19.584 --> 09:21.517
is this guy scared?

09:21.584 --> 09:24.517
They usually are.

09:24.584 --> 09:27.251
Your parents must be
very proud of you.

09:27.318 --> 09:28.417
Are they coming?

09:28.483 --> 09:31.251
My mother died last year.

09:33.117 --> 09:35.617
Well, maybe
she'll be watching you
on saturday anyway.

09:35.684 --> 09:37.617
You believe that stuff?

09:37.684 --> 09:39.784
Actually, yes.

09:39.851 --> 09:40.884
Well, i don't.

09:40.951 --> 09:42.051
There's nothing
after this.

09:42.117 --> 09:44.417
There's no heaven,
there's no hell.

09:44.483 --> 09:46.517
You're born,
you live, you die.

09:46.584 --> 09:47.784
That's it.

09:48.917 --> 09:50.084
Are you sure?

09:52.218 --> 09:54.151
Yeah, i'm sure.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.417
I'm here to do one
thing in this life,
and that's fight,

09:56.483 --> 09:58.817
so that's what
i'm gonna do.

09:58.884 --> 10:01.717
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't talk
about my mother.

10:03.084 --> 10:04.817
Not like that.

10:06.051 --> 10:12.383
Stubborn as a mule,
just like his <i>mami.</i>

10:12.450 --> 10:13.517
Ha ha ha ha!

10:13.584 --> 10:17.750
Oh, i laughed at them...
the doctors...

10:17.817 --> 10:20.750
when they told me i had
a tumor in my brain.

10:20.817 --> 10:24.084
I didn't care about
the odds or statistics.

10:24.151 --> 10:26.917
I got out of
castro's cuba.

10:26.984 --> 10:30.350
I come to this country
with nothing,

10:30.417 --> 10:32.951
made a home,
raised a child.

10:33.017 --> 10:37.017
I had so many challenges
in my life.

10:37.084 --> 10:40.951
I never thought cancer
was gonna beat me.

10:41.017 --> 10:46.284
But then the tumor
spread out
like a spider web.

10:46.350 --> 10:49.017
The doctors
couldn't operate.

10:49.084 --> 10:54.784
I started feeling
like i was disappearing.

10:54.851 --> 10:59.350
They said i had
6 months to live.

10:59.417 --> 11:02.184
6 months?

11:02.251 --> 11:04.318
Teo and my husband

11:04.383 --> 11:07.517
were away in a tournament
when i died.

11:12.117 --> 11:15.584
I watched.

11:15.650 --> 11:17.717
I saw him win.

11:22.084 --> 11:24.517
That is the last thing
i remember.

11:34.450 --> 11:37.450
After my funeral,

11:37.517 --> 11:41.117
teo packed up
and left our house.

11:41.184 --> 11:44.450
It's a mother's
worst nightmare.

11:44.517 --> 11:49.851
She died, and her husband
can't protect your child.

11:49.917 --> 11:52.951
If i just could talk
to gilberto,

11:53.017 --> 11:56.884
ask him what happened
between the two of them.

12:04.117 --> 12:06.117
Look, abby,
you're dragging
your feet!

12:06.184 --> 12:08.151
Come on!
Look alive!

12:11.151 --> 12:13.750
Not gonna beat
holy family looking
like that, girls.

12:16.284 --> 12:19.218
Look at him.
So focused.

12:19.284 --> 12:23.550
Everything he does,
he does 100%.

12:23.617 --> 12:26.984
You'd never say his
heart is breaking.

12:27.051 --> 12:28.450
All right.
Work on your headers.

12:31.717 --> 12:34.184
Excuse me.
Mr. De la costa, hi.

12:34.251 --> 12:35.184
Hi.

12:35.251 --> 12:36.184
I'm melinda gordon.

12:36.251 --> 12:37.218
Nice meeting you.

12:37.284 --> 12:38.750
I'm a friend
of estella's.

12:38.817 --> 12:43.184
Oh. I'm sorry,
have we met before?

12:43.251 --> 12:44.483
I don't remember you.

12:44.550 --> 12:47.184
I'm really more of an
acquaintance of estella's.

12:47.251 --> 12:50.617
Um... she spoke to me
about you.

12:50.684 --> 12:54.984
She loved you...
very much.

12:55.051 --> 12:57.117
Sorry.

12:59.483 --> 13:03.350
Sometimes it's like
i find a new little
piece of her every day.

13:05.584 --> 13:09.483
My friends told me
i would get over this

13:09.550 --> 13:12.051
and that i'll move on.

13:14.717 --> 13:16.584
It just doesn't
get any better.

13:18.483 --> 13:20.917
My heart is so sore.

13:20.984 --> 13:22.017
I'm sorry.

13:22.084 --> 13:24.483
I know
how much it hurts.

13:26.884 --> 13:28.417
You do, don't you?

13:29.584 --> 13:32.218
Ok. That's it for today!

13:32.284 --> 13:35.750
Make sure you get some
orange and water inside you!

13:35.817 --> 13:37.984
And stretch!

13:38.051 --> 13:41.251
Do you ever
feel like sometimes
she's still with you?

13:41.318 --> 13:44.218
Yes. Yes, i do.

13:44.284 --> 13:47.151
Little hints
here and there.

13:47.218 --> 13:49.350
I'll be on the field on
a beautiful, sunny day,

13:49.417 --> 13:52.584
and i'll feel
a surge of happiness

13:52.650 --> 13:55.218
just like i used to feel
when i was coming
home to her.

13:55.284 --> 13:58.717
And for an instant,
i feel like if i just
turn around and look,

13:58.784 --> 14:01.151
she'll be there
beside me.

14:01.218 --> 14:04.151
And, of course, i look,
and she's not there.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.650
Hmm.

14:05.717 --> 14:07.917
And i die a little bit
more inside.

14:07.984 --> 14:11.684
So, how did you meet?

14:11.750 --> 14:15.617
In cuba. I was walking
across the town square

14:15.684 --> 14:17.750
in havana
with my friend miguel,

14:17.817 --> 14:19.917
and i saw her walking
toward me.

14:19.984 --> 14:24.251
He took my picture
before we even met.

14:24.318 --> 14:25.917
You took her picture
before you even met.

14:25.984 --> 14:27.984
With an
old-fashioned camera.

14:28.051 --> 14:30.151
Yes.
It was the last moment

14:30.218 --> 14:31.584
you two
didn't know each other.

14:34.750 --> 14:37.084
I don't understand.

14:37.151 --> 14:40.417
Look, the reason i know
your wife, how i know her,

14:40.483 --> 14:43.218
is that i can see her.

14:43.284 --> 14:44.750
It's a gift i have.

14:51.117 --> 14:54.450
You... estella's here?

14:54.517 --> 14:55.884
She hasn't passed
over yet,

14:55.951 --> 14:57.650
and she
wants to talk to you.

14:59.450 --> 15:02.383
I knew it in my bones
that if i had faith,

15:02.450 --> 15:03.884
that she'd come back
to me.

15:03.951 --> 15:06.383
Is she ok?
No more suffering?

15:06.450 --> 15:07.750
No. Not from sickness.

15:07.817 --> 15:09.951
From something else, though.
She's confused.

15:10.017 --> 15:12.884
Why are you not
training him for
the olympics?

15:12.951 --> 15:14.151
What happened?

15:14.218 --> 15:15.951
She wants to know why
you're not training teo

15:16.017 --> 15:16.984
for the olympics.

15:17.051 --> 15:18.650
You tell her...

15:18.717 --> 15:19.851
you can tell her.

15:19.917 --> 15:22.951
She's standing
right in front of you.

15:23.017 --> 15:24.917
Where?

15:24.984 --> 15:28.483
What's done is done.
I did what you asked
me to do.

15:30.483 --> 15:32.251
What did she
ask you to do?

15:32.318 --> 15:33.784
That's between us.

15:33.851 --> 15:36.483
Excuse me, miss gordon.
I gotta go.

15:39.517 --> 15:42.951
What did you
ask him to do?

15:43.017 --> 15:45.784
????

16:16.788 --> 16:20.687
teo. Remember me?
Anthony majors.

16:20.754 --> 16:22.987
We met in brooklyn,
kid gloves,
a couple years ago.

16:23.053 --> 16:25.053
You saw me fight
fast louie leone.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.053
Tko, third round.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.154
You never had a fight
that went more than 5.

16:29.220 --> 16:30.888
You signed
my fight card.

16:30.953 --> 16:33.154
I still have it, sir.

16:33.220 --> 16:36.320
Well, now we know
we both have
excellent memories.

16:36.387 --> 16:38.320
What are you doing here?
I mean, in grandview?

16:38.387 --> 16:39.953
I'm looking for you.

16:40.020 --> 16:42.087
Me?

16:42.154 --> 16:43.521
A couple of years ago,

16:43.587 --> 16:45.754
your old man was training
you for the olympics.

16:45.821 --> 16:49.953
I read that you qualified
for the national team.
You were big...

16:50.020 --> 16:52.087
then you just dropped
out of sight.

16:52.154 --> 16:53.587
And when i finally
hear your name again,

16:53.654 --> 16:55.621
they tell me
you're fighting in
these little towns,

16:55.687 --> 16:58.053
so i had to come up
and see for myself.

16:58.120 --> 17:02.320
What happened?

17:02.387 --> 17:04.887
We had a death
in the family.

17:04.953 --> 17:06.119
My mother.

17:06.186 --> 17:08.721
I'm sorry to hear that.

17:08.788 --> 17:12.087
I lost my old man when
i was about your age,
so i know how it feels.

17:12.154 --> 17:13.788
I just want to
keep fighting.

17:13.854 --> 17:16.053
The olympics?

17:16.119 --> 17:18.087
Don't really matter
to me anymore.

17:19.253 --> 17:21.319
Is your father
still training you?

17:21.387 --> 17:22.788
No, sir.

17:22.854 --> 17:24.354
Look, teo, i didn't
come all this way

17:24.421 --> 17:26.987
just to talk
about the past.

17:27.053 --> 17:29.053
I want you to come
to my training camp
in florida,

17:29.120 --> 17:32.087
work with my guys,
real trainers.

17:32.154 --> 17:33.287
All due respect.

17:33.354 --> 17:37.154
Take you along slow,
steadily,

17:37.220 --> 17:39.587
the right fights,
the right opponents.

17:39.654 --> 17:43.621
In a year or two,
you'll be the main event.

17:45.587 --> 17:49.254
This is your time,
my friend. Your shot.

17:49.320 --> 17:51.987
I've never been to florida,
mr. Majors.

17:52.053 --> 17:55.387
Well, i guess you could
use a change of scenery,

17:55.454 --> 17:57.554
find the joy
in the sport again,

17:57.621 --> 17:59.721
make nice money.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.621
Make a lot of money.

18:03.354 --> 18:06.621
Look, teo, i know this
is a lot at once,

18:06.687 --> 18:09.020
so why don't we
just hang out for
a couple of days,

18:09.087 --> 18:11.020
let me work with you.

18:11.087 --> 18:12.254
Ok.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.654
Attack!
Yah!

18:13.721 --> 18:14.788
Aah!
Oh, my god!

18:14.854 --> 18:16.754
Oh, i'm sorry!
Ow!

18:16.821 --> 18:18.788
Ow!
Oh, i'm so sorry.
Are you ok?

18:18.854 --> 18:20.888
Have you been
practicing
at home?

18:20.953 --> 18:22.287
A little.

18:22.354 --> 18:25.554
What are you
planning on being,
an urban vigilante?

18:25.621 --> 18:27.053
Well, i don't have
big, strong jim

18:27.120 --> 18:28.587
beside me to protect
me all the time.

18:28.654 --> 18:31.020
Well, i don't always
have big, strong jim
beside me, either.

18:31.087 --> 18:32.854
Ok, then. So you
want to go again?

18:32.920 --> 18:34.053
No.
Uhh!

18:34.120 --> 18:36.554
Ok, class, that's it!

18:36.621 --> 18:37.953
Let's give it up for us!

18:38.020 --> 18:39.220
Whoo!

18:45.687 --> 18:46.987
...get to know
each other.

19:05.387 --> 19:08.654
I love this coat.
I got it at an estate
sale in saratoga.

19:08.721 --> 19:10.654
It belonged to a woman
whose great-grandmother's
best friend

19:10.721 --> 19:11.821
was eleanor roosevelt.

19:11.888 --> 19:13.487
There's a problem.

19:13.554 --> 19:15.920
Andrea can ring that up
for you.

19:15.987 --> 19:17.788
Explain to me something.

19:17.854 --> 19:19.788
Why is it bad
for teo to sign up
with a promoter?

19:19.854 --> 19:21.487
I mean, isn't that
what fighters do?

19:21.554 --> 19:24.888
Well, only amateur
fighters can go to
the olympics.

19:24.953 --> 19:26.654
Once you turn
into a professional,
that's it.

19:26.721 --> 19:28.020
It's all
about the money.

19:28.087 --> 19:31.020
And he's too young
to deal with all that.

19:31.087 --> 19:33.387
We have to talk to
gilberto.

19:33.454 --> 19:37.120
Yeah. I'll talk to him.

19:38.254 --> 19:40.788
Do you know a promoter
named anthony majors?

19:40.854 --> 19:43.387
I knew him when his name
was tony mangione.

19:43.454 --> 19:45.854
He's made a name for
himself on the back
of a lot of boxers.

19:45.920 --> 19:49.354
He wants to take teo
with him to florida,

19:49.421 --> 19:50.888
wants him to turn pro.

19:50.953 --> 19:51.920
What did teo say?

19:51.987 --> 19:55.187
He seems to be
thinking about it.

19:55.254 --> 19:57.020
Your wife came to me
about this.

19:57.087 --> 19:58.220
She's very upset.

19:59.654 --> 20:02.454
I've seen what majors
does to his fighters.

20:02.521 --> 20:04.287
He'll use teo
as cannon fodder

20:04.354 --> 20:06.554
for his top contenders.

20:06.621 --> 20:09.087
He came to me several
years ago in brooklyn,

20:09.154 --> 20:11.287
and i told him,
i am teo's trainer.

20:11.354 --> 20:13.621
We don't need you.

20:13.687 --> 20:15.621
I guess now that i'm
out of the picture...

20:15.687 --> 20:17.920
estella needs you
to talk to teo,

20:17.987 --> 20:20.254
even if it's just to
warn him about majors.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.521
He doesn't have
anyone to guide him.

20:22.587 --> 20:23.754
He needs you.

20:23.821 --> 20:26.888
My son, eh?

20:26.953 --> 20:28.687
You know how it is
between us.

20:28.754 --> 20:31.754
If i tell him to stay
away from majors,
he'll run to him.

20:31.821 --> 20:35.754
Maybe, but if he does
go with him and
something bad happens,

20:35.821 --> 20:37.187
can you live with that?

20:37.254 --> 20:39.521
Majors: That's the advantage
of having a manager

20:39.587 --> 20:40.654
and a promoter.

20:40.721 --> 20:42.154
I make sure that
you're taken care of,

20:42.220 --> 20:43.354
win or lose.

20:43.421 --> 20:45.654
All your contracts
are air-tight.

20:45.721 --> 20:47.120
I meant what l...

20:47.187 --> 20:49.020
what are you
doing here?

20:49.087 --> 20:50.754
I came to talk to you.

20:50.821 --> 20:53.587
I'm anthony majors.

20:53.654 --> 20:55.254
I'm teo's father.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.854
Nice to meet you.

20:56.920 --> 20:59.854
We met several years
ago, mr. Mangione.

20:59.920 --> 21:02.454
I came to talk to him,
not you.

21:02.521 --> 21:05.254
Whatever
you want to say to me,
you can say to mr. Majors.

21:05.320 --> 21:08.354
Son, i know we don't
see eye to eye,

21:08.421 --> 21:09.754
but you're smarter
than this!

21:09.821 --> 21:11.220
This man's
not your friend.

21:11.287 --> 21:13.521
I can take care
of myself, pop.

21:13.587 --> 21:17.287
Mr. De la costa, i
assure you, i just want
what's best for him.

21:17.354 --> 21:19.621
You want
what's best for you.

21:19.687 --> 21:22.287
Well, that's teo's
decision, isn't it?

21:22.354 --> 21:24.454
Mr. Majors thinks
i'm ready to go pro.

21:24.521 --> 21:25.721
So do i.

21:25.788 --> 21:29.621
Son, you were heading
towards the olympics.

21:29.687 --> 21:31.287
You were this close.

21:31.354 --> 21:33.053
We both know what happened
with that, don't we, pop?

21:33.120 --> 21:34.621
Your mother
wanted that for you!

21:34.687 --> 21:37.387
Who are you to talk to me
about my mother?

21:37.454 --> 21:39.220
You know what she wanted.

21:40.521 --> 21:41.888
Anyway, she's gone.

21:41.953 --> 21:43.387
All that matters now
is what i want.

21:43.454 --> 21:45.421
Don't you see
that what she wanted

21:45.487 --> 21:48.587
is more important now
than ever because
she's gone?

21:48.654 --> 21:50.387
I don't have to listen
to you,

21:50.454 --> 21:52.387
not anymore.

21:52.454 --> 21:54.587
You don't think i feel
what you feel?!

21:54.654 --> 21:56.154
Look at me, boy!

21:56.220 --> 21:59.154
She was your mother,
but she was my wife!

21:59.220 --> 22:00.587
And i wasn't with her,
either.

22:00.654 --> 22:04.554
Please, don't do this
to each other.

22:07.821 --> 22:10.354
It's too late, <i>papi.</i>

22:10.421 --> 22:11.788
It's too late.

22:21.788 --> 22:23.287
Please, don't go!

22:23.354 --> 22:25.387
????

22:33.794 --> 22:36.694
So far, we've raised
5 grand for the firehouse,

22:36.761 --> 22:37.794
and with this fight...

22:37.861 --> 22:39.360
i thought you were
hoping for 1,000.

22:39.427 --> 22:43.028
Ah, people in the town
are just really
turning out for teo.

22:43.093 --> 22:44.627
It's great to see.
Hmm.

22:47.694 --> 22:49.093
They all want to say
they knew him when.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.093
Did you get his father
to talk to him?

22:52.160 --> 22:54.594
Apparently, it only
made things worse.

22:54.661 --> 22:56.093
He's really hurting.

22:56.160 --> 22:57.827
What is so hard about
people just talking
to each other?

22:57.894 --> 23:01.193
Talk, listen,
talk, listen.

23:01.260 --> 23:04.961
Was it ever that
simple for you
and your parents?

23:05.028 --> 23:08.227
Ok. We had the talking
part down pretty good.

23:08.294 --> 23:10.494
I don't know. There's
something else, though.

23:10.561 --> 23:12.160
Something
they're keeping from me.

23:12.227 --> 23:13.227
What do you think it is?

23:13.294 --> 23:15.260
I don't know.
Family stuff.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.260
Hard to unravel.

23:17.327 --> 23:19.594
I'm not really sure
it should be unraveled,

23:19.661 --> 23:21.327
at least not by me.

23:21.394 --> 23:22.994
Anything i can do?

23:23.060 --> 23:26.327
Funny you should ask.

24:07.861 --> 24:10.227
I fight for you, <i>mami.</i>

24:10.294 --> 24:12.894
Everything i do is for you.

24:12.961 --> 24:17.360
Every time i win,
i feel closer to you.

24:17.427 --> 24:19.527
I wish you were here.

24:33.961 --> 24:36.494
Who would you say
your greatest influence is?

24:36.561 --> 24:38.160
Definitely
oscar de la hoya.

24:38.227 --> 24:40.028
I remember watching him
win the gold in barcelona.

24:40.093 --> 24:42.894
Against marco rudolph...
the only u.s. Gold medal.

24:42.961 --> 24:44.827
Wasn't your dad
training you
for the olympics?

24:44.894 --> 24:46.861
Why does everyone want
to talk about my father?

24:46.928 --> 24:48.093
He's dead to me.

24:48.160 --> 24:49.494
Oh, i know
what you mean.

24:49.561 --> 24:51.861
My dad's
dead to me, too.

24:51.928 --> 24:52.894
What? You mean...

24:52.961 --> 24:55.227
yeah. Dead dead.

24:56.294 --> 24:57.627
Listen, i'm sorry.

24:57.694 --> 24:58.694
I didn't mean to bring...
don't worry about it.

24:58.761 --> 25:00.227
It's all the same.

25:00.294 --> 25:02.561
We weren't really
speaking at the end.

25:02.627 --> 25:03.694
Why not?

25:03.761 --> 25:05.627
I don't know.
He didn't like who i was

25:05.694 --> 25:07.227
or who i became,
i guess.

25:07.294 --> 25:08.260
Come on.
You're kidding,
right?

25:08.327 --> 25:10.527
No. He wanted
my brother and me

25:10.594 --> 25:12.028
to go into
his brokerage business,

25:12.093 --> 25:14.028
one of these huge
wall street companies.

25:14.093 --> 25:17.160
A lot of people
with very nice shoes.

25:17.227 --> 25:18.794
Then my brother died

25:18.861 --> 25:19.861
and the pressure
was really on me

25:19.928 --> 25:20.961
to step up and,
you know,

25:21.028 --> 25:22.794
take my place
in the family dynasty.

25:22.861 --> 25:24.227
What do i do?

25:24.294 --> 25:28.227
I become a paramedic,
a civil servant.

25:29.661 --> 25:33.761
I was never happier,
but him, he was never
more miserable.

25:33.827 --> 25:34.761
So what happened?

25:34.827 --> 25:35.894
You know,
he cut me off,

25:35.961 --> 25:37.227
i cut him off.

25:37.294 --> 25:38.394
It's what men do,
right?

25:38.460 --> 25:41.861
You don't need me.
Watch me not need you.

25:41.928 --> 25:43.294
The thing is,
you know, somehow

25:43.360 --> 25:45.861
you always think
it'll get sorted out,

25:45.928 --> 25:47.861
and you always
think there's time.

25:47.928 --> 25:49.928
Anyhow, that's just me.

25:49.994 --> 25:51.561
I'm sure you guys
have plenty of time.

25:51.627 --> 25:53.360
You know, i bet
it's been a while

25:53.427 --> 25:54.961
since you've had
a home-cooked meal.

25:55.028 --> 25:56.561
Why don't you
come over tonight,

25:56.627 --> 25:57.961
have dinner
with me and my wife?

25:58.028 --> 26:01.928
Listen, you know,
i gotta wake up early,

26:01.994 --> 26:02.994
and i gotta
watch what i eat.

26:03.060 --> 26:05.193
Great. See you
tonight around 7:00?

26:10.360 --> 26:11.661
Ooh, that's great.

26:11.727 --> 26:13.327
I'll swing by
the grocery store
on my way home.

26:13.394 --> 26:17.127
Hey, i am very capable
of making a wonderful
dinner under pressure.

26:17.193 --> 26:18.827
I'll see you
in an hour. Bye.

26:20.494 --> 26:21.427
You're leaving?

26:21.494 --> 26:23.127
It's closing time.

26:23.193 --> 26:24.627
And?

26:24.694 --> 26:28.227
And i'm going home.
That's what closing
time means.

26:28.294 --> 26:29.761
That's funny,
'cause tonight,

26:29.827 --> 26:30.994
i thought it meant
self-defense class

26:31.060 --> 26:32.994
and dinner after.
You forgot.

26:33.060 --> 26:34.761
Completely forgot.

26:34.827 --> 26:38.761
It's just that i got
jim to invite teo
for dinner, and...

26:38.827 --> 26:40.794
i'm sorry.

26:40.861 --> 26:43.394
It's, um... it's fine.
It's totally fine.

26:43.460 --> 26:45.694
I'll find out if we can
take a makeup class.

26:45.761 --> 26:48.127
I feel terrible
about this.
Don't.

26:48.193 --> 26:49.827
You take your responsibilities
very seriously,

26:49.894 --> 26:51.994
and i really
admire that.

26:52.060 --> 26:53.761
Are you mad?

26:53.827 --> 26:55.527
Melinda, stop.

26:55.594 --> 26:56.928
All right?

26:58.260 --> 26:59.761
Wait a minute.
You're planning
on cooking?

26:59.827 --> 27:00.994
Wish me luck.

27:01.060 --> 27:01.994
I should wish teo luck.

27:02.060 --> 27:03.494
Gee, thanks.

27:03.561 --> 27:04.561
Have fun.

27:05.594 --> 27:08.594
1, 2...

27:08.661 --> 27:12.561
honey, you need
way more red pepper
than that.

27:12.627 --> 27:15.127
Don't worry.
It's not gonna hurt you.

27:15.193 --> 27:16.894
Why are you
so distracted?

27:16.961 --> 27:18.360
Let's just say
i won't be getting

27:18.427 --> 27:21.861
my own cooking show
on the food network
anytime soon.

27:21.928 --> 27:23.227
I'm telling you,

27:23.294 --> 27:26.894
<i>churrasco estilo cubano</i>
is teo's favorite dish.

27:26.961 --> 27:30.661
Now, if it is not spicy,
he's not gonna like it.

27:30.727 --> 27:33.594
Didn't your mother
teach you how to cook?

27:33.661 --> 27:34.761
I am already
stressed out.

27:34.827 --> 27:35.794
Please do not
bring up my mother.

27:39.327 --> 27:43.494
Oh, wow! That is
really good! Ha!

27:43.561 --> 27:45.160
I can't believe
i made it myself.

27:45.227 --> 27:47.594
Right. Being dead
means i get no credit?

27:47.661 --> 27:49.294
I would have never
thought to use
this much seasoning,

27:49.360 --> 27:51.193
but whoo! Ha ha!

27:51.260 --> 27:56.260
A lesson you should apply
for the other parts
of your life.

27:58.928 --> 27:59.861
Yeah.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.694
Yeah.

28:01.761 --> 28:04.427
Teo. Hey,
how you doing?

28:04.494 --> 28:05.861
Nice house.
Thanks.

28:05.928 --> 28:07.193
Just don't take
too close a look

28:07.260 --> 28:09.193
at the plumbing,
the wiring, or the roof.

28:10.694 --> 28:11.827
Hi.

28:11.894 --> 28:12.894
Hi, melinda.

28:12.961 --> 28:15.093
Nice to
see you again, teo.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.294
Thank you.

28:16.360 --> 28:17.227
Look, i'm sorry
about what happened

28:17.294 --> 28:18.294
at the gym
the other day.

28:18.360 --> 28:19.394
Forget it.

28:19.460 --> 28:20.894
I tend to have
that effect on people.

28:20.961 --> 28:21.894
Wine?

28:21.961 --> 28:22.894
No, thanks.
I don't drink.

28:22.961 --> 28:24.594
Told you. Water?

28:24.661 --> 28:26.294
Yes, please.

28:28.193 --> 28:29.561
Hello, son.

28:49.781 --> 28:51.380
Dinner is served.

28:51.447 --> 28:52.380
Smells great.

28:52.447 --> 28:53.614
Here we go, guys.

28:53.681 --> 28:55.781
We eat like this
every day.
What is that?

28:55.848 --> 28:58.214
<i>Churrasco estilo cubano.</i>

28:58.280 --> 29:00.414
It's my favorite.
How'd you know?

29:00.481 --> 29:03.214
Oh! Put that spoon down!

29:03.280 --> 29:04.547
Put your spoon down.

29:06.781 --> 29:08.080
Estella:
Where are your manners?

29:08.147 --> 29:10.314
We don't eat
until we say grace.

29:10.380 --> 29:13.547
I would like to say grace
first, if that's ok.

29:15.113 --> 29:16.881
I'm sorry.

29:18.980 --> 29:21.414
God bless this house
and this family.

29:21.481 --> 29:23.814
God bless this house
and this family.

29:23.881 --> 29:25.414
Make us grateful...

29:25.481 --> 29:26.914
make us grateful...

29:26.980 --> 29:28.380
for your mercy...
for your mercy...

29:28.447 --> 29:30.547
and mindful for
the needs of others.

29:30.614 --> 29:31.781
And mindful
of needs of others.

29:31.848 --> 29:33.848
Amen.
Amen.

29:41.514 --> 29:45.414
Mmm! This tastes
just like my wife's.

29:45.481 --> 29:47.848
It's almost
as if she's here.

29:48.881 --> 29:49.980
Is she?

29:51.180 --> 29:53.080
What's going on?
Teo.

29:53.147 --> 29:54.414
You rigged
this whole thing,
didn't you?

29:54.481 --> 29:55.647
No, i didn't.

29:55.714 --> 29:57.948
You gave her
<i>mami's</i> recipe.

29:58.013 --> 29:59.314
You told her how
she always said grace,

29:59.380 --> 30:01.113
the exact words
she said.

30:01.180 --> 30:03.747
Teo, i promise you,
i didn't say a thing.

30:03.814 --> 30:05.481
No, it's true.
He didn't say anything to me.

30:10.080 --> 30:11.814
Look, the truth is...

30:14.481 --> 30:17.414
the truth is,
your mom is here,

30:17.481 --> 30:18.881
and that's why
i invited you to dinner...

30:18.948 --> 30:20.848
because i can see her.
I can talk to her.

30:20.914 --> 30:22.147
You're lying.
Teo.

30:22.214 --> 30:24.614
My mother is dead.

30:24.681 --> 30:25.980
He put you up
to this

30:26.047 --> 30:27.647
'cause he's trying
to get me to do
what he wants.

30:27.714 --> 30:29.481
I don't care
what you want!
No, that's not...

30:29.547 --> 30:31.047
i do what's best
for me.

30:32.280 --> 30:33.481
Teo.

30:35.481 --> 30:38.180
I know you have
my photo in your bible.

30:38.247 --> 30:40.047
You have a picture
of her in your bible.

30:40.113 --> 30:41.980
What is this?

30:42.047 --> 30:43.347
What are you doing?

30:43.414 --> 30:46.380
All i want is peace
between you and
your father.

30:46.447 --> 30:48.881
She just wants you
and your father
to be at peace.

30:48.948 --> 30:52.447
It's true.
Your mother's here.
I can feel her.

30:52.514 --> 30:54.047
You got to
sense her, too.

30:54.113 --> 30:55.380
I always feel her.

30:55.447 --> 30:57.247
You can't hate me forever.

30:57.314 --> 30:58.347
She doesn't want that.

30:58.414 --> 30:59.948
I don't hate you, <i>papi.</i>

31:00.013 --> 31:02.581
But i can't forgive you
for taking me away
from her.

31:02.647 --> 31:04.547
You let her die alone.

31:10.080 --> 31:11.314
Teo, stop. Please!

31:11.380 --> 31:13.447
Leave me alone!

31:13.514 --> 31:14.914
How did you know
those things?

31:14.980 --> 31:16.514
How did you
know that i had
that photo?

31:16.581 --> 31:19.280
Think about it.
How could i have known
unless she told me?

31:21.881 --> 31:26.380
My mother... is she
really here with me?

31:26.447 --> 31:29.848
Yes. She's right here.

31:31.714 --> 31:35.347
I can't believe that.
I can't. How can...

31:35.414 --> 31:37.180
you have you gifts,
and i have mine.

31:37.247 --> 31:43.080
I am so proud of you.
I'm proud of everything
you've done.

31:43.147 --> 31:44.414
She's so proud of you, teo.

31:44.481 --> 31:47.948
Although i never
liked you to be
a boxer.

31:48.013 --> 31:50.681
Did you know that
she never wanted you
to be a boxer?

31:50.747 --> 31:51.848
What?

31:51.914 --> 31:52.848
What mother would
want to see her baby

31:52.914 --> 31:55.914
get beaten up?
Ha ha ha ha!

31:55.980 --> 31:58.581
She would have
wrapped me in band-aids
if i would have let her,

31:58.647 --> 32:00.314
from head to toe.

32:00.380 --> 32:01.481
No.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.914
I couldn't
protect her.

32:07.980 --> 32:09.948
I wasn't there
when she died.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.747
I'll never forgive
him for that.

32:15.247 --> 32:16.881
No one's perfect.

32:16.948 --> 32:21.080
Everyone makes mistakes,
even your parents.

32:21.147 --> 32:22.948
She's saying that
no one is infallible.

32:23.013 --> 32:25.814
Please, <i>mami.</i>
Stop making
excuses for him.

32:25.881 --> 32:28.581
He took me away.

32:28.647 --> 32:29.581
He made me go
to that tournament.

32:29.647 --> 32:31.047
I didn't want to go,
but...

32:31.113 --> 32:32.481
he insisted.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.647
I didn't want
to leave you.

32:42.180 --> 32:44.280
Now i'm never gonna
go to the olympics

32:44.347 --> 32:45.881
because i don't
deserve to go.

32:45.948 --> 32:47.514
I wasn't with you.

32:47.581 --> 32:49.814
This is my punishment.
No.

32:49.881 --> 32:52.013
She wants you to let go
of your anger.

32:52.080 --> 32:55.681
Everything
that happened
is in the past.

32:55.747 --> 32:57.614
Melinda: You can't
live in the past.

32:57.681 --> 32:59.314
You have to
forgive yourself.

33:01.747 --> 33:03.481
I can't.

33:05.080 --> 33:06.647
I can't.

33:06.714 --> 33:08.380
I'm sorry.

33:15.214 --> 33:17.581
Why did you take him away
to the tournament?

33:17.647 --> 33:19.914
Estella wants to know
why you took teo away.

33:21.080 --> 33:23.314
She's saying
she doesn't remember?

33:23.380 --> 33:24.948
Yes.

33:25.013 --> 33:27.013
<i>Mi amor,</i>

33:27.080 --> 33:30.714
it's because
you told me to.

33:36.828 --> 33:38.761
jim: Good evening,
grandview!

33:39.794 --> 33:42.227
And welcome to the fight
of the century!

33:42.294 --> 33:46.060
Thank you. Because of you,
we have raised over $7,000,

33:46.127 --> 33:47.360
so give yourself a big hand.

33:51.761 --> 33:53.861
Let's go, baby.
Tonight's
the night.

33:53.928 --> 33:55.027
Be the man
out there, ok?

33:55.093 --> 33:56.427
All right.

33:59.928 --> 34:00.993
Where's your head,
champ?

34:01.060 --> 34:02.194
I'm here.

34:02.260 --> 34:03.527
Good.

34:03.594 --> 34:04.960
Listen, after you
knock this guy out,

34:05.027 --> 34:06.561
i got some papers
for you to sign

34:06.627 --> 34:09.661
and a first-class
plane ticket
to miami.

34:09.726 --> 34:12.661
Oh, what is this?
Grand central station?

34:12.726 --> 34:14.661
I came here
to talk to my son.

34:14.726 --> 34:16.159
It won't take long.

34:16.226 --> 34:17.561
It's important.

34:17.627 --> 34:20.360
If you need me,
i'll be right outside.

34:20.427 --> 34:22.393
Your mother and i
need you to know

34:22.460 --> 34:24.993
why we made that
decision for you to
go to the tournament.

34:25.060 --> 34:26.194
She's here?

34:26.260 --> 34:28.793
Estella:
Teo, i told you

34:28.860 --> 34:30.993
that everybody
makes a mistake.

34:31.060 --> 34:32.393
I was talking
about me.

34:32.460 --> 34:34.928
One of the last times
she was able to
talk to me,

34:34.993 --> 34:37.928
before her mind went,

34:37.993 --> 34:39.561
before she started
to fade away...

34:39.627 --> 34:43.694
my will is in
the safety deposit box,

34:43.761 --> 34:48.694
along with the birth
certificates and
our marriage license.

34:48.761 --> 34:51.893
You're not
gonna die, ok?

34:51.960 --> 34:53.527
So stop talking
like that.

34:53.594 --> 34:56.360
You must do as i say.

34:58.993 --> 35:03.027
This is going to happen.

35:05.561 --> 35:07.160
I know it's hard,

35:07.227 --> 35:09.794
but soon enough, i...

35:09.861 --> 35:13.661
i won't even know
we had this talk,

35:13.727 --> 35:15.993
and you have to
remember this for me.

35:16.060 --> 35:17.861
I'm listening.

35:17.928 --> 35:21.527
Teo's career
must come first.

35:21.594 --> 35:22.627
Do you understand?

35:22.694 --> 35:24.260
Yes.

35:24.327 --> 35:25.894
Yes.
Do you?

35:25.960 --> 35:29.027
Look at me.

35:29.093 --> 35:32.661
I don't want teo
to miss his moment

35:32.727 --> 35:37.694
because he's at my bedside
watching me die.

35:37.761 --> 35:41.861
We only have one chance
to live this life.

35:41.928 --> 35:43.761
Don't!

35:43.828 --> 35:46.427
I had my chance.

35:46.494 --> 35:48.527
He must have his.

35:49.527 --> 35:51.894
Now, promise me.

35:51.960 --> 35:55.960
Tell him someday
to forgive me.

35:56.027 --> 36:01.861
Hey, he's gonna
have to forgive me,
not you. Never you.

36:04.394 --> 36:06.661
I was just trying
to protect you.

36:06.727 --> 36:09.561
She didn't realize she
was taking away your
chance to say good-bye.

36:09.627 --> 36:11.227
It was
my mistake, teo.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.227
My mistake,
not your father's.

36:13.294 --> 36:15.427
She needs you
to forgive her.

36:16.794 --> 36:19.360
Of course i forgive her.

36:19.427 --> 36:22.127
And she needs to know
that you forgive
your father.

36:22.194 --> 36:26.461
He was only
doing what she
asked him to.

36:27.894 --> 36:29.527
All this time, <i>papi...</i>

36:30.694 --> 36:32.727
you let me think
it was you?

36:32.794 --> 36:34.993
I thought you were
putting the olympics
ahead of her.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.527
Why didn't you say
something?

36:36.594 --> 36:39.794
You know it was
easier for you to be
mad at me than at her.

36:39.861 --> 36:42.027
I didn't think you
would understand, son,

36:42.093 --> 36:45.761
and i'm sorry,
'cause your mother
and i made a mistake.

36:45.828 --> 36:48.661
Estella: You need
to be a family again,

36:48.727 --> 36:50.027
stay together.

36:51.461 --> 36:53.327
She needs you
to stay together,

36:53.394 --> 36:56.294
be a family.

36:56.360 --> 36:57.594
Teo.

36:57.661 --> 37:00.894
She's giving you
the chance to say
good-bye.

37:37.794 --> 37:38.794
I'm ready.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.993
She wants you to win
tonight. She also said

37:42.060 --> 37:43.727
not to hurt the guy
too badly.

37:44.960 --> 37:46.394
No single punches.

37:46.461 --> 37:47.561
Combinations.

37:47.627 --> 37:49.661
And i want you to be
first, always first.

37:49.727 --> 37:51.727
Be aggressive.

37:53.561 --> 37:54.993
Crowd: Teo! Teo!

37:55.060 --> 37:56.894
Teo! Teo!

37:56.960 --> 37:58.694
Teo! Teo!

37:58.761 --> 38:00.327
Teo! Teo!

38:00.394 --> 38:01.527
Teo! Teo!

38:01.594 --> 38:03.360
Teo! Teo!

38:03.427 --> 38:04.461
Teo! Teo!

38:04.527 --> 38:06.060
You're gonna go
all the way, teo.

38:06.127 --> 38:07.794
Tonight's just
the beginning.

38:07.861 --> 38:09.360
You're right, mr. Majors.
I am...

38:09.427 --> 38:12.027
but not with you.
Thanks for everything.

38:13.694 --> 38:15.294
Teo! Teo!

38:15.360 --> 38:16.727
Teo! Teo!

38:16.794 --> 38:18.461
Teo! Teo!

38:18.527 --> 38:20.394
I have one more
good-bye to say.

38:22.427 --> 38:28.060
Gilberto, estella knows
that she took your chance
to say good-bye away,

38:28.127 --> 38:29.928
and she
wants to fix it now.

38:29.993 --> 38:31.594
So...

38:34.194 --> 38:37.327
You make my life
so beautiful.

38:38.360 --> 38:40.160
[Speaking quietly]

38:40.227 --> 38:41.794
I hope you find
love again.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.993
[Speaking quietly]

38:44.060 --> 38:45.960
I will never forget you,
estella.

38:46.027 --> 38:50.993
I will raise our son,
and everything i do,

38:51.060 --> 38:54.160
i'll do like if you're
watching me, so...

39:00.861 --> 39:02.360
Hey!
Ha ha ha!

39:07.694 --> 39:09.960
Jim: Ladies and gentlemen...
and firemen...

39:10.027 --> 39:11.661
you know who you are...

39:11.727 --> 39:14.527
uh, without further ado,
i'd like to introduce
tonight's fighters.

39:14.594 --> 39:17.260
In the blue corner,
in green trunks,

39:17.327 --> 39:22.894
weighing 140 pounds,
centerville's best...
jackie o'callahan.

39:29.527 --> 39:33.727
And in the red corner,
in the red trunks...

39:40.093 --> 39:42.894
teofilo de la costa!

39:57.427 --> 39:58.993
I won't quit
my day job.

40:01.661 --> 40:03.727
Teo! Teo! Teo!

40:30.394 --> 40:31.794
He's down!
