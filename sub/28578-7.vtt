00:05.108 --> 00:06.896
U-S-A!

00:06.959 --> 00:10.340
Hello, racist
bumper-sticker salespeople,

00:10.428 --> 00:12.731
guys who've punched
a claw machine,

00:12.818 --> 00:16.295
people who frequently graffiti
their ex's garage door,

00:16.383 --> 00:19.649
teens who will have their
Ivy League admission rescinded,

00:19.736 --> 00:21.920
and other shrieking jackals!

00:22.069 --> 00:24.899
I'm here to announce that,
in 2020,

00:24.986 --> 00:29.287
win or lose,
I will win the election!

00:30.459 --> 00:32.715
I'm walking over here now...

00:32.803 --> 00:35.065
showing you
that I'm keepin' it loose...

00:35.152 --> 00:38.524
proving to everyone that
I can be a tough walkin' man.

00:38.611 --> 00:41.521
And now I'm moseying on back.

00:42.110 --> 00:45.399
Now, as I explained to
ABC's George Snuffaluffagus,

00:45.486 --> 00:47.732
I am now accepting
foreign intelligence

00:47.819 --> 00:49.584
on my Democratic opponents.

00:49.672 --> 00:51.314
Simply call the number below!

00:51.402 --> 00:53.248
Operators are standing by!

00:53.336 --> 00:56.940
No more stuff on Biden.
That treasure chest is full!

00:57.028 --> 00:59.209
So many people
have made tonight possible,

00:59.297 --> 01:03.514
but none more so than
Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.

01:03.678 --> 01:07.201
You two have done
absolutely nothing to stop me,

01:07.289 --> 01:10.899
and, for that, please accept
this statue of a family dog

01:10.986 --> 01:12.959
watching the house
get robbed.

01:13.068 --> 01:16.107
You said we'd discuss
the infrastructure bill!

01:16.194 --> 01:17.565
You're being
too pushy.

01:17.652 --> 01:19.178
Thank you, Mr. President.

01:19.266 --> 01:21.387
- Thank you, everyone!
- You're making us blush!

01:21.527 --> 01:23.582
For more on
my second-term agenda,

01:23.670 --> 01:27.668
please direct your easily seized
attention to the jumbotron!

01:27.756 --> 01:29.988
If you thought
President Trump's first term

01:30.076 --> 01:31.465
got your pulse pounding,

01:31.553 --> 01:33.980
his second term
will make your heart explode.

01:34.068 --> 01:36.691
National Guard... on speed dial.

01:36.778 --> 01:38.896
Nuclear secrets... for sale.

01:38.984 --> 01:41.396
Basic human decency... buh-bye!

01:41.486 --> 01:43.605
And think Trump
can't spell any worse?

01:43.693 --> 01:44.982
Think aglenn.

01:45.069 --> 01:46.941
Donald Trump 2020.

01:47.028 --> 01:49.107
You're Gonna Get
a Rash, Buster.

01:49.466 --> 01:50.523
Alright!

01:50.611 --> 01:52.649
Who wants pig hearts?!

01:52.736 --> 01:56.273
Not enough to go around,
so start clawing!

02:07.130 --> 02:09.336
Don, did you
put the crime sock on the door?

02:09.425 --> 02:11.189
Yeah, Dad.
No one will bother us.

02:11.277 --> 02:13.649
Okay, let's talk
shady self-enrichment!

02:13.736 --> 02:15.441
How's our
Washington hotel?

02:15.529 --> 02:16.533
We're killing it!

02:16.621 --> 02:19.565
The Chinese spent five million
dollars on room service.

02:19.652 --> 02:21.524
It's floor-to-ceiling
french toast!

02:21.611 --> 02:23.933
Okay, let's hear
from my favorite son.

02:24.021 --> 02:26.649
- Ivanka?
- Mnuchin gave me the keys to the Treasury

02:26.736 --> 02:29.023
and said on the weekends,
anything goes!

02:29.110 --> 02:30.705
What the hell,
Pompeo?!

02:30.831 --> 02:32.728
Hey, is this sock on
the doorknob up for grabs?

02:32.816 --> 02:34.572
- It's pretty nice.
- La. la la la la!

02:34.660 --> 02:36.034
I can't hear what's
being conspired in here!

02:36.121 --> 02:37.386
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

02:37.473 --> 02:39.330
Look what you did, Pompeo!

02:39.418 --> 02:41.136
You take the crime sock
off the door,

02:41.224 --> 02:43.777
and this place turns into
Grand Central Station!

02:43.975 --> 02:46.347
So... can I put this
on my foot or...?

02:46.980 --> 02:49.345
Even though Mueller
gave you a pass on collusion,

02:49.432 --> 02:51.220
you still have to worry
about the money laundering,

02:51.307 --> 02:52.637
the campaign finance
violations,

02:52.724 --> 02:54.627
and those other crimes
I won't mention in case

02:54.715 --> 02:56.729
there's still recording devices
hidden in the lampshades.

02:56.816 --> 02:59.762
Hello. I'll just pardon
myself. Are we done?

02:59.849 --> 03:02.470
I could be committing
systematic genocide right now.

03:02.529 --> 03:05.064
Okay, it is far from guaranteed
that the Supreme Court

03:05.152 --> 03:06.622
will uphold the power
to pardon yourself.

03:06.709 --> 03:08.144
Of course
they will, Jared.

03:08.232 --> 03:11.472
The ruling was foretold in
the Great Prophecy of Valantium.

03:11.893 --> 03:12.907
Let me ask you.

03:12.995 --> 03:14.919
H-How exactly do you think
the Supreme Court works?

03:15.006 --> 03:16.877
If you spent less time
in the weight room

03:16.965 --> 03:18.745
and more time in class,
you would know that...

03:18.832 --> 03:20.822
every
half moon, the Supreme Court

03:20.910 --> 03:24.012
rises out of the ancient swamps
of Kilga-Goranth

03:24.099 --> 03:26.754
to exact their
righteous judgment on our kind.

03:26.842 --> 03:27.894
The big, buff justices

03:27.982 --> 03:30.340
wear magical cloaks
that they can keep on

03:30.451 --> 03:32.781
even when they go through
airport security.

03:32.932 --> 03:34.845
♪ Justice ♪

03:35.097 --> 03:37.386
You're actually a lot
closer than I thought.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.808
Ooh, justice!

03:41.047 --> 03:43.251
Mmm, justice.

03:43.393 --> 03:45.683
Ooh, justice.

03:45.794 --> 03:47.673
I'm Jake Tapper,
and I go to movies

03:47.761 --> 03:50.386
just to shush stepdads
and their sons.

03:50.473 --> 03:53.386
Justice John Roberts spoke
today at a legal conference

03:53.473 --> 03:55.580
and discussed the power
of the president

03:55.668 --> 03:57.410
to pardon himself.
Take a look.

03:57.498 --> 04:00.469
Obviously, I'm not going to
present my opinion here,

04:00.557 --> 04:01.637
but I will say that

04:01.724 --> 04:04.230
presidential power
is not absolute.

04:04.363 --> 04:06.461
Here to analyze
Roberts' comments

04:06.549 --> 04:09.416
is constitutional scholar,
political expert,

04:09.504 --> 04:11.337
and mezzo soprano... me.

04:11.425 --> 04:15.121
♪ Trump is definitely screwed ♪

04:16.553 --> 04:20.027
I booked our next big-game
hunting trip, Don!

04:20.115 --> 04:22.244
They just shove
a drugged-up lion

04:22.332 --> 04:23.931
into the back
of a Honda Odyssey,

04:24.019 --> 04:25.929
and we get to shoot it
through the windows.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.553
I'm afraid you'll have to take
those hunting trips alone.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.595
As the eldest,
I'll be inheriting

04:30.683 --> 04:32.261
the presidency in 2024.

04:32.348 --> 04:34.566
So if you're launching
your political career,

04:34.654 --> 04:37.683
does that mean I'm gonna run
the Trump Organization?

04:37.798 --> 04:39.336
You're not cut out
for that!

04:39.454 --> 04:42.613
You're meant for dumber shit
like ventriloquism school.

04:45.207 --> 04:47.746
I tried, but me
and Deion the Donkey

04:47.849 --> 04:49.230
didn't have
what it takes.

04:49.418 --> 04:51.352
Then you must show Dad
that you can be

04:51.440 --> 04:53.004
an upstanding businessman
like me.

04:53.092 --> 04:54.853
Now pretend you lost
your factory job

04:54.941 --> 04:57.035
so I can practice nodding
as if I care.

04:57.123 --> 04:59.371
- W-We're down to one single sheet...
- Okay.

04:59.475 --> 05:02.136
- Of white bread for my family of eleven.
- Uh-huh. I don't care. I mean, I do care.

05:02.223 --> 05:03.840
- Please, Mr. Trump.
- Nodding, nodding.

05:04.793 --> 05:06.136
You're not screwed.

05:06.223 --> 05:07.512
You got four out of five

05:07.599 --> 05:09.637
conservative justices
in the bag.

05:09.724 --> 05:11.550
Just go schmooze
the robes off of him.

05:11.638 --> 05:14.480
I'm not the schmoozer, Mitch.
I'm the schmooz-ee.

05:14.599 --> 05:17.136
Check the mug. I just wish
I could add more buff

05:17.223 --> 05:19.595
Supreme Court justices
who dig my vibe.

05:19.682 --> 05:21.666
That's called
"packing the court,"

05:21.754 --> 05:23.553
and there's nothing
in the Constitution

05:23.640 --> 05:24.970
that says you can't do it.

05:25.057 --> 05:28.386
I'm sorry, but why the eff
did you not say this earlier?

05:28.473 --> 05:30.681
Upending centuries
of judicial protocol

05:30.769 --> 05:33.804
is way easier than schmoozing
John Roberts for three minutes!

05:33.891 --> 05:35.178
Just a heads up, though.

05:35.265 --> 05:38.207
The Democrats might have
some thoughts on this.

05:40.762 --> 05:43.133
And as Aristotle said,

05:43.221 --> 05:44.301
"Fear is pain...

05:44.389 --> 05:47.844
Arising from the
anticipation of evil."

05:48.055 --> 05:52.504
That concludes my one-slide
PowerPoint by Eric Tump.

05:52.650 --> 05:56.035
Sorry about the typo.
I couldn't find the backspace.

05:56.123 --> 05:59.377
Eric, you're just not cut out
for the family business.

05:59.465 --> 06:02.378
Remember when I let you build
Trump International Manhattan?

06:02.466 --> 06:06.045
I believe you're referring
to the infamous Jelly Tower.

06:06.148 --> 06:07.937
We saved a lot of money
on beans

06:08.094 --> 06:10.173
but lost a lot
of money on jelly.

06:10.307 --> 06:11.662
Hmm.

06:14.508 --> 06:17.185
My father liked to dangle
his approval in front of me,

06:17.273 --> 06:18.849
and it's only right
I do the same.

06:18.974 --> 06:21.338
Prove to me you can handle
more responsibility,

06:21.426 --> 06:24.011
and I'll make you
my last-ditch pick for CEO.

06:24.099 --> 06:28.044
Dad, I'll be so responsible,
you'll leave your kids with me.

06:28.168 --> 06:30.596
Fat chance!
My kids are assholes!

06:30.684 --> 06:32.466
You wouldn't last
a second!

06:32.653 --> 06:34.762
We now join
the Senate Judiciary Committee

06:34.849 --> 06:36.838
who is hearing testimony
from President Trump's

06:36.926 --> 06:40.231
Supreme Court nominee,
My Pillow CEO, Michael Lindell.

06:40.319 --> 06:42.495
So, I crawled
out of the drain pipe,

06:42.583 --> 06:44.542
my pants shredded
like those things

06:44.630 --> 06:46.387
that slap you at the car wash

06:46.475 --> 06:48.395
when you're hiding out
from three guys

06:48.483 --> 06:50.966
with knives Scotch-taped
to their knuckles,

06:51.054 --> 06:52.997
and all I've got left
to my name

06:53.085 --> 06:57.307
is a baby bottle full of NyQuil
and 30 dimes of flake.

06:57.395 --> 07:01.565
So I'm thinkin', "Mikey, ya
gotta get the heck out of Fresno

07:01.653 --> 07:04.262
before you end up
married again."

07:04.390 --> 07:07.950
Sir, uh, all we asked
was your date of birth.

07:08.038 --> 07:11.208
I can give you the month...
Summer.

07:11.557 --> 07:13.929
"Crash-and-burn"
is what people are saying

07:14.016 --> 07:15.887
about Trump's effort
to pack the court.

07:15.974 --> 07:18.303
The three remaining nominees
withdrew after learning

07:18.397 --> 07:22.223
their wages would be garnished
for child support. Yeesh!

07:27.099 --> 07:28.434
Oh, God.

07:28.665 --> 07:31.362
Donald J. Trump,
the court finds you guilty

07:31.450 --> 07:34.512
of phony witch-hunt charges
made up by losers and fakes!

07:34.600 --> 07:37.591
I sentence you to
a million years in prison!

07:40.569 --> 07:42.524
Recreation time is up!

07:42.612 --> 07:44.567
Everyone back in their cells

07:44.655 --> 07:47.651
for 23 hours
of sedentary rest!

07:47.783 --> 07:48.973
- Hooray!
- Whoo!

07:49.061 --> 07:50.864
Ahh. I kinda like this.

07:50.952 --> 07:53.466
No one's making me do stuff,
food's chewy,

07:53.554 --> 07:57.341
I get cool geometric tattoos
from white supremacists.

07:58.057 --> 08:00.470
You said it, Dad!
I mean, roomie!

08:00.557 --> 08:02.136
I got a million years
in here, too!

08:02.223 --> 08:04.887
How many years is a
million years? Let's count.

08:04.974 --> 08:08.470
One, two, three,
four, five...

08:08.598 --> 08:11.286
sex... sick! seven!

08:16.286 --> 08:17.388
You were right, Mitch.

08:17.476 --> 08:18.630
I must be the schmoozer,

08:18.718 --> 08:20.511
and Supreme Court,
the schmoozees.

08:20.599 --> 08:22.963
Great! What we need
is a fancy place

08:23.051 --> 08:26.553
where French guys serve Italian
food under Chinese lanterns!

08:26.640 --> 08:28.012
We're in Washington,
Rudy.

08:28.099 --> 08:30.054
All the restaurants suck,
and there aren't any good

08:30.141 --> 08:31.762
husband-and-wife
cabaret acts.

08:31.849 --> 08:33.442
There's only one place
ritzy enough

08:33.530 --> 08:35.818
to schmooze Roberts
and those other nobodies.

08:35.905 --> 08:38.861
The place where everyone can be
whoever they want to be.

08:38.948 --> 08:41.528
As long as they pay
the $200,000 fee.

08:41.616 --> 08:44.011
Where on Earth
could that be?!

09:41.932 --> 09:43.893
Your security detail

09:43.981 --> 09:45.428
from our homes
in the dead of night.

09:45.515 --> 09:46.958
And they scared
the daylights

09:47.046 --> 09:49.625
out of the paparazzi
standing in my yard.

09:49.713 --> 09:53.393
Did you know that last year
they made two movies about me?

09:53.481 --> 09:54.380
Yes.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.297
Who gives a crap
how we got here?

09:56.385 --> 09:58.630
We're away from our jobs,
our families,

09:58.724 --> 10:00.301
the specters of our past.

10:00.389 --> 10:01.928
That's the
alarming spirit.

10:02.016 --> 10:05.260
Swing vote John Roberts,
you're so cute and dangerous.

10:05.348 --> 10:07.929
Come ride with me
in my executive golf cart.

10:08.016 --> 10:11.551
The rest of you can ride in
Stephen Miller's hatchback.

10:11.989 --> 10:14.612
No eating of the smoked trout
in the back seat!

10:14.700 --> 10:16.911
That's for
Uber customers.

10:17.389 --> 10:20.219
Does Roberts look like
he'll melt in my arms yet?

10:20.307 --> 10:23.136
I'd worry more about your sailor
on shore leave over there.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.887
It says you're open at 8:00,
but it's 8:02!

10:25.974 --> 10:28.716
I could sue you
for false advertising!

10:29.332 --> 10:32.770
He asked the concierge if,
instead of a regular room with a mini-bar,

10:32.858 --> 10:34.845
he could get a mini-room
with a regular bar.

10:34.932 --> 10:37.303
I could look after
Judge Kavanaugh!

10:37.391 --> 10:38.606
Sure, kid.

10:38.694 --> 10:41.094
Keep that twitchy lush
from ruining my schmooze-fest,

10:41.182 --> 10:44.669
and you can be CEO of any
of my billion-dollar fronts.

10:45.724 --> 10:47.970
Excuse me.
Could I have a juice?

10:48.058 --> 10:51.221
My on-again-off-again boyfriend
always gets me a juice.

10:51.337 --> 10:54.230
I told you...
He's a starfucker!

10:54.343 --> 10:56.631
To get the full
Mar-a-Iago experience,

10:56.719 --> 10:58.758
you gotta sit
with the power players.

10:58.891 --> 11:01.208
Rudy Giuliani.
God damn it!

11:01.296 --> 11:04.262
I spilled ketchup on the gravy
I spilled on my suit!

11:04.390 --> 11:06.559
Shinzo Abe.
He's always here.

11:08.689 --> 11:11.060
Then there's this Russian guy.
We have an understanding.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.044
He tells me to do stuff,
and I do it.

11:13.917 --> 11:16.618
We should really invite over
the other justices.

11:16.706 --> 11:18.735
They actually told me
they think you stink

11:18.823 --> 11:20.261
and are probably
a bad kisser.

11:20.348 --> 11:22.774
The best way to get back at them
is to let me pardon myself

11:22.862 --> 11:25.206
for crimes past,
present, and future.

11:25.294 --> 11:27.963
I... have to go to
the little men's room.

11:28.051 --> 11:30.886
Oy. Way to go, Shinzo.
You blew it.

11:30.974 --> 11:32.485
Take your meal
back to your room.

11:32.573 --> 11:34.527
It's always
Shinzo's fault.

11:34.615 --> 11:37.526
And don't spill caramel
on the bed again!

11:37.614 --> 11:38.768
<i>I know!</i>

11:38.856 --> 11:40.304
So, in order to graduate

11:40.392 --> 11:43.389
from Victor Balloon's
School of Ventriloquism,

11:43.477 --> 11:45.557
Deion the Donkey and I
needed to execute

11:45.645 --> 11:48.526
the fabled
double-donkey hee-haw.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.993
Anyways,
you work at, uh...?

11:51.081 --> 11:53.594
SCOTUS! I should have
never signed up!

11:53.682 --> 11:55.178
It's the worst thing
I've ever done!

11:55.265 --> 11:56.970
Where's my beer?!

11:57.057 --> 11:59.956
I worked my whole life to
drink a beer right now!

12:00.065 --> 12:02.987
I'm actually not supposed
to let you drink.

12:03.075 --> 12:06.887
Uhh! But I like beer!
I like beer! I like beer!!

12:06.974 --> 12:08.595
What if I just
vouch for you

12:08.682 --> 12:11.041
like the way
Squi vouched for me?

12:11.129 --> 12:12.292
You'd do that?

12:12.387 --> 12:15.134
Beep-borp-bup-bup.
Hello? Mr. Trump?

12:15.222 --> 12:16.969
Yes, I am sober.

12:17.057 --> 12:19.511
You'll make Eric the CEO
tomorrow morning?

12:19.599 --> 12:21.345
I'll tell him right now!
Beep.

12:21.433 --> 12:23.041
A round of beers
to celebrate?!

12:23.129 --> 12:25.588
Okay! But just one.

12:32.611 --> 12:33.709
G-Gah!

12:33.797 --> 12:36.487
Rise and shine,
my favorite justice!

12:36.599 --> 12:39.573
We've got an amazing,
action-packed day ahead of us.

12:39.682 --> 12:40.745
How did you get in here?

12:40.833 --> 12:42.651
I have all the keys
to all the doors.

12:42.739 --> 12:44.568
The groundskeeper fished
the bloated, dead guy

12:44.656 --> 12:46.643
out of the pool,
so get your trunks on,

12:46.731 --> 12:48.185
then you'll let me
pardon myself,

12:48.273 --> 12:49.978
then we'll hit
the omelet bar.

12:50.066 --> 12:52.312
I know you're trying to
exert undue influence on me

12:52.400 --> 12:53.440
to vote in your favor.

12:53.528 --> 12:56.357
And as umpire of the court,
I call that a foul ball.

12:56.765 --> 12:58.348
I usually don't do this,

12:58.436 --> 13:01.303
but what if I switched you
to a bed-bug free room?

13:03.859 --> 13:06.938
Is that the hardest
you can slap, Jelly Boy?!

13:07.026 --> 13:09.814
Hey! You promised
you wouldn't call me that!

13:09.902 --> 13:12.077
I turned my back
on Deion the Donkey

13:12.165 --> 13:13.761
to build Jelly Tower!

13:13.849 --> 13:16.595
Oh, I'm sorry,
Jelly Boy!

13:16.784 --> 13:20.114
You gonna cry boysenberry tears
out of your marmalade eyes

13:20.202 --> 13:23.833
coming out of your
jelly face, Jelly Boy?!

13:23.921 --> 13:26.061
I'm a Jelly Man!

13:26.225 --> 13:27.220
Oww!

13:27.307 --> 13:30.364
Now my face is gonna go
from beautiful crimson

13:30.452 --> 13:31.921
to ugly vermilion!

13:32.009 --> 13:33.637
What are you
gonna do about it...

13:33.724 --> 13:37.053
Wah-wah cry like you did
at your hearing?

13:37.170 --> 13:39.254
I'm gonna head-butt you
'til you die!

13:39.396 --> 13:42.303
- Bring it!
- One, two...

13:44.845 --> 13:46.759
Donald, quit trying to
schmooze the Supreme Court

13:46.846 --> 13:49.538
and just poke them with
a poison-tipped umbrella.

13:49.682 --> 13:51.460
We don't have umbrellas
in Florida.

13:51.548 --> 13:52.936
It's the Sunshine State.

13:53.024 --> 13:55.094
Then get some kompromat
that'll make Roberts

13:55.182 --> 13:57.075
the laughingstock
of the whole judiciary.

13:57.163 --> 13:58.220
Ooh, and while
you're at it,

13:58.307 --> 14:00.428
do the other justices
dirty, too!

14:00.515 --> 14:02.845
That's why you're the leader
of the free world.

14:02.932 --> 14:04.288
I can't take
all the credit.

14:04.376 --> 14:06.678
You got to give some
to the death squads.

14:07.927 --> 14:11.436
Wow! Do you guys know
how to party or what?!

14:12.616 --> 14:14.428
And keep that applause going

14:14.515 --> 14:17.100
for our Guy of the Year
Award recipient,

14:17.188 --> 14:19.268
Chief Justice Roberts!

14:19.432 --> 14:22.382
Are you any closer
to giving me my self-pardon?

14:22.470 --> 14:24.966
I said "no"
and I look like a fool.

14:25.081 --> 14:27.591
Fine! Then the only thing left
is the group kompromat...

14:27.679 --> 14:28.801
I mean group photo.

14:28.889 --> 14:31.427
Everyone grab some champagne
and hop on stage!

14:31.599 --> 14:33.264
Let's just do this
so we can go to bed.

14:33.352 --> 14:35.552
- Sanders, remember.
- Downward angle, find your light.

14:35.640 --> 14:37.054
I know, I know.

14:37.141 --> 14:38.512
Say "blackmail."

14:38.599 --> 14:39.772
Blackmail.

14:39.860 --> 14:41.356
Is it hot fire?

14:41.577 --> 14:44.657
♪ I've got my kompromat,
I've got my kompromat ♪

14:44.745 --> 14:46.260
Wow. You should be
on Broadway.

14:46.348 --> 14:48.220
So the Supreme Court
will issue a decision

14:48.307 --> 14:50.845
on the presidential
self-pardon Monday at noon.

14:50.932 --> 14:53.155
I wonder who
I'll self-pardon first.

14:53.243 --> 14:55.452
Hmm. I'm thinking me.

14:55.702 --> 14:57.220
Look at that.
As a result of this

14:57.307 --> 14:59.874
compromising leaked photo,
the eight justices pictured

14:59.962 --> 15:01.928
have recused themselves
from all legal matters

15:02.016 --> 15:03.117
pertaining to the president.

15:03.204 --> 15:04.701
Who would leak
such a thing?

15:04.789 --> 15:07.969
I took that in the privacy
of a 250-seat ballroom

15:08.057 --> 15:09.366
with 19 entrances.

15:09.454 --> 15:11.999
The hot photo appeared
on the Instagram account

15:12.087 --> 15:14.501
of Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe.

15:14.589 --> 15:17.085
I want Shinzo's badge and gun
on my desk by morning.

15:17.195 --> 15:18.944
This means that,
in the upcoming hearing

15:19.032 --> 15:21.181
concerning the president's
self-pardon power,

15:21.269 --> 15:23.120
the opinion will be issued
at the sole discretion

15:23.207 --> 15:26.829
of the one Justice not recused,
Brett Kavanaugh.

15:26.932 --> 15:28.208
Ohh! Even better!

15:28.296 --> 15:29.720
He'll give you
the kind of justice

15:29.807 --> 15:31.810
that rich, white guys have
been passing back and forth

15:31.897 --> 15:33.473
ever since
the nation's founding.

15:33.561 --> 15:34.803
All we have to do
is make sure

15:34.891 --> 15:36.803
Brett Kavanaugh's
on that bench on Monday.

15:36.891 --> 15:39.551
Don't worry. I got
my best, weirdest son

15:39.639 --> 15:40.973
taking care of him.

15:42.749 --> 15:44.116
Whoa.

15:44.204 --> 15:46.094
What happened
last night?

15:46.182 --> 15:49.386
It's just like that R-rated
bachelor-party movie

15:49.473 --> 15:51.100
The Hang Glider.

15:52.959 --> 15:54.882
"Jelly Man,
last night reminded me

15:54.970 --> 15:56.795
how much I enjoy
being away from it all,

15:56.883 --> 15:58.541
drowning in liquid fun!

15:58.629 --> 15:59.914
Don't come looking for me,

16:00.002 --> 16:01.533
or I'll take the fuck off
running!

16:01.640 --> 16:04.517
Signed, coach of my daughter's
basketball team, Brett K."

16:06.390 --> 16:09.025
I can't find him anywhere, Don!

16:09.113 --> 16:11.512
You're lucky I'm an
expert at understanding

16:11.599 --> 16:14.406
the inner workings
of a middle-aged party king.

16:14.494 --> 16:15.553
You have any clues?

16:15.640 --> 16:19.762
There's a loafer print headed
due west in this mound of vomit.

16:19.849 --> 16:22.181
He flew the coop!
I'm coming down there, Eric.

16:22.269 --> 16:24.264
Good thing I have shit loads
of Southwest points

16:24.352 --> 16:26.681
from tickets I bought so I could
get drunk at I. Guardia.

16:26.769 --> 16:28.932
Wait! I think
I know where he is!

16:29.020 --> 16:32.135
Have you ever heard of
a town called... Orlando?

16:32.223 --> 16:33.876
Have you ever heard
of a town called

16:33.964 --> 16:35.830
"Shut Up,
I'll Meet You There"?

16:36.894 --> 16:39.820
Let us bow our heads in prayer
to Brett Kavanaugh

16:39.908 --> 16:42.490
for making this lawlessness
possible for me.

16:42.578 --> 16:44.939
May he go to bed
without getting the spins.

16:45.027 --> 16:46.150
Amen.

16:46.238 --> 16:47.945
Now, what crimes
should I commit?

16:48.033 --> 16:51.178
And remember, there are no small
crimes... only short criminals.

16:51.265 --> 16:52.742
Before you commit
more crimes,

16:52.830 --> 16:54.054
shouldn't you wait
until Kavanaugh

16:54.141 --> 16:55.744
actually hands down
his ruling?

16:55.832 --> 16:57.343
That's strike three,
Pompeo.

16:57.431 --> 16:59.219
Strikes one and two
were existing.

16:59.307 --> 17:00.471
Will there be
any more innings?

17:00.558 --> 17:02.013
We just found
our next crime...

17:02.101 --> 17:05.472
We're gonna torture Pompeo until
he swallows his own tongue!

17:05.560 --> 17:07.138
- That's great!
- Let's kill him, huh?

17:07.227 --> 17:09.400
I'm free all day,
so just let me know.

17:10.656 --> 17:12.344
These dolphins
are kept alive

17:12.432 --> 17:14.954
only by the fish
they receive mid-backflip.

17:15.042 --> 17:18.626
Wow! Wait. What the hell
are we doing at SeaWorld?

17:18.714 --> 17:22.009
Brett's note said he wanted
to drown in "liquid fun."

17:22.097 --> 17:25.928
I used my deductive,
future CEO logic to deduce

17:26.016 --> 17:30.072
that SeaWorld is the liquid-fun
capital of Florida.

17:30.160 --> 17:34.053
Eric, "liquid fun"
is bro-slang for beer!

17:34.141 --> 17:36.056
There's no beer
at SeaWorld!

17:36.144 --> 17:38.891
How long has he been gone?
Two days.

17:38.979 --> 17:41.053
Two days of drunk stumbling

17:41.141 --> 17:43.126
is four days
of sober sprinting.

17:43.214 --> 17:44.416
He could be anywhere,

17:44.504 --> 17:48.208
you irresponsible, grade-A,
grass-fed, all-beef ass-patty!

17:48.426 --> 17:51.007
♪ It's the weekend,
it's time to have fun ♪

17:51.124 --> 17:53.161
Mike Pompeo,
for the crime of being

17:53.265 --> 17:55.212
a boring-annoying-dumb
loser,

17:55.300 --> 17:57.755
I sentence you to
sledgehammering of the legs,

17:57.843 --> 18:00.089
then blowtorching,
then poisoning,

18:00.177 --> 18:03.328
and finally being eaten
good and slow by fire ants.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.012
If I'm gonna be
covered in ants,

18:05.099 --> 18:06.887
can I at least have
a picnic with them?

18:06.974 --> 18:09.386
That's it. I'm setting
the crossbow to turbo.

18:09.473 --> 18:11.136
It's Eric, sir.
Do you wanna talk

18:11.223 --> 18:13.095
or should I just
make up something?

18:13.182 --> 18:14.212
Ugh...

18:14.300 --> 18:15.876
Dad, remember
when you said

18:15.964 --> 18:18.705
you'd always love me no matter what?
Nope.

18:18.800 --> 18:22.517
I lost Brett Kavanaugh!

18:22.619 --> 18:24.408
D-a-a-ad!

18:24.530 --> 18:26.205
Kavanaugh is gone.

18:26.298 --> 18:28.515
Now I'm just another
below-the-law schmuck

18:28.603 --> 18:30.762
who can be thrown in jail
like my former lawyer,

18:30.850 --> 18:32.015
former campaign chief,

18:32.103 --> 18:34.392
and three dozen
of my closest associates.

18:34.486 --> 18:37.994
I could pardon you if I was
president. Hint, hint.

18:38.908 --> 18:40.306
It's been two days

18:40.394 --> 18:43.266
since Supreme Court Justice
Brett Kavanaugh

18:43.354 --> 18:46.302
disappeared into
the humid badlands of Florida.

18:46.390 --> 18:48.378
Search parties
continue to comb through

18:48.466 --> 18:50.365
every roadside motel bar

18:50.453 --> 18:53.741
and empty Circuit City with
a back door you can jimmy open.

18:53.829 --> 18:55.701
Maybe they found Kavanaugh
on Hannity.

18:55.789 --> 18:58.785
With Brett Kavanaugh missing,
we all have no choice

18:58.873 --> 19:01.619
but to retreat underground
with the survivalist buckets

19:01.707 --> 19:04.203
for sale exclusively
on my website!

19:04.291 --> 19:07.779
My favorite is the Hannity
Jalapeño Popper Pizza Slop!

19:07.867 --> 19:09.982
Mmm! Buy the...
Buy the whole pail!

19:10.099 --> 19:12.970
Melania, I can't go to
prison looking this pretty.

19:13.057 --> 19:14.441
I know this is difficult,

19:14.529 --> 19:16.771
but I need you to hit me
as hard as you...

19:18.249 --> 19:20.669
Thanks for
pitchin' in, honey.

19:21.679 --> 19:22.926
Drat!

19:23.014 --> 19:24.589
Thought it might be
Kavanaugh,

19:24.677 --> 19:27.810
but it's just another
dead, bloated guy.

19:27.898 --> 19:29.685
Time to face facts...
You'll always be

19:29.773 --> 19:31.266
the businessman
fisher-outer

19:31.354 --> 19:33.255
and never
the businessman fishee.

19:33.390 --> 19:36.470
How will I ever live up
to my family name?

19:36.557 --> 19:38.638
All I have
are my handsome gums

19:38.763 --> 19:42.326
and 28 credits toward
my ventriloquism degree.

19:42.414 --> 19:44.660
Forget it, Eric.
Your only career path now

19:44.748 --> 19:46.677
is to join
my Secret Service detail

19:46.765 --> 19:49.677
and somehow not fall in love
with me, à la The Bodyguard.

19:49.765 --> 19:51.130
And good luck
because I am...

19:51.218 --> 19:54.099
♪ Enchanting as ass ♪

19:54.662 --> 19:55.836
Because all the judges

19:55.932 --> 19:58.855
are either recused
or horking into the Everglades,

19:58.943 --> 20:01.470
the Supreme Court
will fail to hear my case.

20:01.557 --> 20:03.637
You're the man of
the White House now, Mikey.

20:03.724 --> 20:05.787
Here's the presidential
suit and tie.

20:05.875 --> 20:07.455
They'll probably
be tight on you.

20:07.568 --> 20:11.458
As much as I appreciate the
gesture, I shall not accept.

20:11.546 --> 20:14.443
If there's one thing your
supporters don't want to see,

20:14.599 --> 20:17.771
it's you being held accountable
for your actions.

20:17.859 --> 20:20.255
Pardon or no pardon,
you need to fight

20:20.343 --> 20:23.029
to make sure America
continues to be a place

20:23.117 --> 20:26.919
where guys like you
can get away with anything.

20:30.939 --> 20:33.841
♪ And I'm with you ♪

20:34.057 --> 20:36.115
♪ Tonight ♪

20:36.466 --> 20:38.678
Eric, are you seriously
not gonna put your name in?

20:38.765 --> 20:39.804
They got Sublime!

20:39.891 --> 20:42.474
I see why Brett
was so into this beer.

20:42.591 --> 20:45.553
It makes being a failure
a lot more palatable.

20:45.640 --> 20:46.951
You didn't fail today.

20:47.039 --> 20:48.810
You failed the moment
you tried to be

20:48.898 --> 20:50.602
a bad-ass business Trump
like me

20:50.690 --> 20:52.395
instead of an artsy
ass-wad Trump

20:52.483 --> 20:54.310
walking around with
a donkey on his hand.

20:54.398 --> 20:56.425
I just want to
prove I'm responsible

20:56.515 --> 20:59.428
and get
Brett Kavanaugh back!

20:59.515 --> 21:01.720
Sorry, Eric.
As a child of privilege,

21:01.807 --> 21:04.095
you don't always get what you
want the minute you want it.

21:04.182 --> 21:06.470
Sometimes you have to wait for
things to fall into your lap.

21:06.557 --> 21:07.693
Ahh!

21:07.898 --> 21:10.185
And next up
for karaoke is Coach Brett K!

21:10.280 --> 21:14.652
Uh... how's everybody doin'?!
Shut up!

21:15.845 --> 21:18.224
I don't
wanna go to Washington!

21:18.312 --> 21:22.469
Take me to Tobin's garage
for whip-its and garlic knots!

21:22.557 --> 21:24.488
You belong
on the Supreme Court

21:24.576 --> 21:26.303
deciding
the reproductive fate

21:26.390 --> 21:28.574
of every single
American woman!

21:28.662 --> 21:30.497
We don't have much time!
Floor it!

21:30.585 --> 21:32.841
Is this the end
of your presidency?

21:32.929 --> 21:34.258
When you came for Clinton,

21:34.346 --> 21:36.302
he hopped
on Jeffrey Epstein's jet

21:36.390 --> 21:39.136
and hightailed it to Harlem
to write his memoirs.

21:39.223 --> 21:41.303
When you tried to pin
those million Iraq murders

21:41.397 --> 21:43.495
on George W. Bush, he escaped

21:43.583 --> 21:45.935
to his artist's loft
to paint bathtubs.

21:46.023 --> 21:48.083
And when you came
for William Henry Harrison,

21:48.171 --> 21:49.896
he got pneumonia and died!

21:49.984 --> 21:51.708
But America elected me

21:51.796 --> 21:53.941
to see how much stuff
I could get away with,

21:54.036 --> 21:56.354
and I'm not done
getting away with stuff.

21:56.442 --> 21:58.926
- <i>Mr. President!</i>
- Get the hell out of my way!

21:59.014 --> 22:01.093
Mr. President,
it's your shithead sons.

22:01.205 --> 22:04.293
Dad! It's your shithead sons!
We found Brett Kavanaugh!

22:04.406 --> 22:06.736
He smells like an
un-air-conditioned food court!

22:06.824 --> 22:08.320
Sandblast the puke
from his face

22:08.408 --> 22:09.697
and get him
in that judge dress.

22:09.785 --> 22:11.410
We have no time to lose.

22:15.958 --> 22:17.245
Kavanaugh's on his way.

22:17.333 --> 22:18.665
You need to stall
until he gets here.

22:18.752 --> 22:19.895
I'm on it!

22:19.983 --> 22:21.783
For my first stall,

22:21.871 --> 22:24.676
I'd like to take a really
long time to say my name.

22:24.849 --> 22:29.207
Ruuuuuudddddyyy
Giuuuuliannniii

22:29.295 --> 22:31.877
Crap! That came out way
faster than I meant it to!

22:31.965 --> 22:33.643
Alright. What else?
What else? Um...

22:33.731 --> 22:34.918
Ah, one of the old favorites!

22:35.006 --> 22:37.502
It was a beautiful
September morning,

22:37.590 --> 22:39.457
not a cloud in the sky...

22:40.921 --> 22:43.011
I think he peed!

22:43.099 --> 22:44.845
Oh, good.
That means he's alive!

22:44.932 --> 22:48.393
So Lorne Michaels turns to me
and says, "Can we be funny?"

22:48.481 --> 22:49.919
- Is this over yet?
- <i>And, totally off the cuff, I said...</i>

22:50.006 --> 22:52.512
- I'm meeting with Jeff Katzenberg at 4:00.
- <i>What did I say?</i>

22:52.599 --> 22:55.895
I told you, Hollywood's
gonna eat you alive!

22:56.129 --> 22:58.385
Wait! Don't marry him
or whatever!

22:58.473 --> 23:00.160
Quick, Eric.
Get him on the bench!

23:00.248 --> 23:03.231
I would, Dad, but he's
too blitzed to speak.

23:03.319 --> 23:06.385
If I'm so blitzed, then
how come I can still say...

23:06.473 --> 23:08.035
BLLUUGHHHH!

23:08.123 --> 23:09.662
There's nothing left
to do now

23:09.750 --> 23:11.621
but accept
our pitiful failure.

23:11.759 --> 23:16.082
If only someone could make
Brett Kavanaugh talk...

23:19.338 --> 23:22.844
So, Justice Kavanaugh,
do you think my dad

23:22.932 --> 23:25.072
should be able
to pardon himself?

23:25.160 --> 23:26.637
I sure do,

23:26.724 --> 23:29.707
as much as I think
you need a bath!

23:29.832 --> 23:30.887
Got 'im!

23:30.974 --> 23:34.386
Aww. That's not
very nice, Justice Kavanaugh.

23:34.473 --> 23:36.595
You know
what's even more not nice?

23:36.682 --> 23:39.254
Charging the president
for his crimes.

23:39.347 --> 23:41.094
He is above us all.

23:41.213 --> 23:42.684
Hee haw!

23:42.772 --> 23:44.260
Holy shit! He did it!

23:44.348 --> 23:46.450
He did the
double-donkey hee-haw!

23:46.538 --> 23:47.993
Who said that?

23:48.080 --> 23:49.168
Aah!

23:49.267 --> 23:50.930
He bit off his finger!

23:51.080 --> 23:52.827
I don't care if I go to jail.

23:52.915 --> 23:55.494
This is the best thing
I've ever seen!

23:55.673 --> 23:58.106
It was a dramatic day
at the Supreme Court.

23:58.194 --> 24:00.858
We have these exclusive
courtroom sketches.

24:00.953 --> 24:02.657
There's Kavanaugh
biting off Eric's finger,

24:02.783 --> 24:06.416
then regurgitating it
toward Donald Jr.'s scrotum,

24:06.504 --> 24:07.918
then there's some keep-away.

24:08.095 --> 24:10.174
But Kavanaugh did submit
a written opinion,

24:10.301 --> 24:11.809
which I have here.

24:12.192 --> 24:15.418
Okay. This is a bar menu from a
West Palm Beach Margaritaville.

24:15.506 --> 24:17.877
As to whether the president
can pardon himself,

24:17.971 --> 24:20.551
it's still unclear,
but between Dred Scott

24:20.639 --> 24:22.803
and Citizens United,
the ruling to allow

24:22.891 --> 24:24.918
"Maui Wowie Nacho Tacos

24:25.006 --> 24:26.862
to be two-for-one
on Wednesdays"

24:26.950 --> 24:28.804
is one of the least-harmful
decisions

24:28.891 --> 24:30.621
the Supreme Court has ever made.

24:32.223 --> 24:34.770
So, are you allowed
to pardon yourself or nah?

24:34.858 --> 24:35.801
No one knows.

24:35.889 --> 24:38.969
So I'll just give it a shot,
see if anyone freaks out.

24:39.057 --> 24:42.098
Eric, I want to thank you
for tracking down Kavanaugh

24:42.186 --> 24:43.300
and bringing him back here,

24:43.388 --> 24:45.426
no matter how bad
it made the city smell.

24:45.557 --> 24:48.428
You've proven you really
can handle responsibility.

24:48.551 --> 24:51.815
Does this mean
I'm CEO of Trump Org?!

24:51.903 --> 24:52.970
Even better!

24:53.057 --> 24:57.136
I'm making you CEO of
Trump Ventriloquism University!

24:57.223 --> 25:00.362
We're opening
a Ventriloquism University?!

25:00.450 --> 25:01.932
It's more of
a money-laundering front

25:02.020 --> 25:04.095
for which you will be held
legally responsible,

25:04.182 --> 25:05.215
but you're the CEO.

25:05.303 --> 25:08.926
When the Feds come, I'll make
Deion the Donkey take the fall!

25:09.057 --> 25:10.345
That's my boy!

25:10.432 --> 25:13.072
Now everyone shut up and put
the crime sock on the door.

25:13.160 --> 25:14.728
