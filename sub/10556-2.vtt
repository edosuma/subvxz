00:46.312 --> 00:48.405
Gentlemen,
it is my distinct honor

00:48.481 --> 00:50.972
to introduce
our keynote speaker,

00:51.051 --> 00:54.452
Inspector Thomas Brackenreid.

00:57.023 --> 00:59.617
Thank you.

00:59.659 --> 01:03.254
Gentlemen, those of us
at Police Station Number Four

01:03.329 --> 01:04.989
of the Toronto Constabulary

01:05.065 --> 01:08.626
had never been confronted
by such a puzzling crime.

01:08.701 --> 01:12.228
The victim was found
in a windowless room

01:12.305 --> 01:14.671
that was locked from the inside.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.039
But that was not
the most baffling part.

01:17.110 --> 01:19.772
The victim
had been electrocuted,

01:19.846 --> 01:21.780
yet the room had no electricity.

01:27.854 --> 01:31.381
All that was out of the ordinary
was a shattered jar,

01:31.458 --> 01:34.791
a chain, a wooden disc,
and some foil.

01:36.896 --> 01:41.390
It soon became apparent
that the victim had been killed

01:41.468 --> 01:43.629
by a Leyden jar.

01:46.473 --> 01:48.031
A question, Inspector.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.770
Chief Constable Stockton.
Of course.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.311
What is a Leyden jar?

01:52.378 --> 01:55.609
Uh, it's a device for storing
electric charge.

01:55.682 --> 01:56.944
Then it's a battery.

01:57.050 --> 01:59.712
No. No, it's...
It's a...

01:59.752 --> 02:02.220
It's a capacitor.

02:03.490 --> 02:04.855
What's a capacitor?

02:04.924 --> 02:06.323
Uh...

02:06.392 --> 02:09.383
A device for storing
electric charge.

02:09.461 --> 02:11.828
- Then it's a battery.
- Well...

02:11.898 --> 02:15.493
- Inspector, if I may interject
- Of course.

02:15.568 --> 02:18.196
Detective William Murdoch,
gentlemen.

02:18.271 --> 02:21.331
Gentlemen, both a battery
and a capacitor

02:21.407 --> 02:22.931
do store electrical charge.

02:23.009 --> 02:26.740
However, a battery creates
that charge internally

02:26.813 --> 02:28.405
by chemical reaction.

02:28.481 --> 02:31.678
A capacitor needs
an outside source of power.

02:33.419 --> 02:35.910
So, in 1746, van Musschenbroek

02:35.989 --> 02:38.423
had made the same discovery
that von Kleist had...

02:38.491 --> 02:39.924
The foil inside the jar

02:39.993 --> 02:41.961
could store
a significant electrical charge,

02:42.028 --> 02:43.893
in the order
of hundreds of volts.

02:43.963 --> 02:45.294
More than enough to kill a man.

02:47.567 --> 02:50.559
So, in summary,
there was no foul play.

02:50.637 --> 02:53.299
The cause of death
was misadventure.

02:53.373 --> 02:55.034
Good God, man.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.838
How did you ever come up
with such a conclusion?

03:09.956 --> 03:13.119
Sometimes these things
just come to me.

03:15.328 --> 03:16.590
Thank you, Detective.

03:18.464 --> 03:20.762
Now, might I suggest
that we take a short break

03:20.833 --> 03:24.064
for tea and cake
and maybe a wee dram, gentlemen?

03:29.209 --> 03:31.507
Detective, might I have a word?

03:31.578 --> 03:33.739
Yes, sir.
Of course.

03:38.985 --> 03:41.249
"These things just come to me. "

03:41.321 --> 03:42.754
I'm sorry.

03:42.822 --> 03:44.687
I did not mean to commandeer
that meeting, sir.

03:44.757 --> 03:47.851
Forget it, Murdoch. I'm used to
you and your ideas by now.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.089
What did Stockton
want to speak to you about?

03:53.166 --> 03:55.361
He suggested I apply
for the inspector position

03:55.435 --> 03:57.164
coming open
at Station Number Three.

03:57.270 --> 03:58.396
You, an inspector?

03:58.438 --> 04:00.269
I think my record
speaks for itself.

04:00.340 --> 04:02.035
Murdoch,
you're a bloody good copper,

04:02.108 --> 04:04.201
and you've got a mind
like no one else I've ever met.

04:04.277 --> 04:05.301
But trust me...

04:05.378 --> 04:07.744
You're not cut out for the shite
that comes with the job.

04:07.814 --> 04:09.304
Perhaps.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.577
But I could use
the raise in pay.

04:11.651 --> 04:14.415
And I suppose the change
in scenery could do me good.

04:14.487 --> 04:16.978
What, are we not good enough
for you at Station Number Four?

04:17.055 --> 04:18.853
No, no. Not at all.
It's just that...

04:18.925 --> 04:21.951
Well, as you know, I've had
some challenges as of late.

04:22.028 --> 04:24.087
Yes, yes.
Well, suit yourself.

04:24.163 --> 04:26.131
But don't say I didn't warn you.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.432
Thank you, sir.

04:39.879 --> 04:41.813
Inspector, there was a trunk
delivered for you.

04:41.881 --> 04:42.939
This note came with it.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.347
Right.

04:44.417 --> 04:47.352
Whatever's in there is,
uh, quite substantial.

04:49.989 --> 04:52.048
Open it, Crabtree.

05:03.836 --> 05:05.633
Oh, my God.

05:19.185 --> 05:20.482
Have you finished
with the trunk?

05:20.553 --> 05:21.952
Yes, for now.

05:22.021 --> 05:23.249
Gentlemen.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.730
His name is Pollack.
Percival Pollack.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.737
- The lawyer?
- Yes.

05:38.805 --> 05:41.535
When can I expect your report,
Doctor Ogden?

05:41.607 --> 05:43.802
I'll perform the postmortem
right away.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.173
Thank you.

05:50.717 --> 05:52.582
Murdoch.

05:59.125 --> 06:02.686
What kind of man delivers
a corpse to a police station?

06:03.596 --> 06:05.427
"Dear Inspector Brackenreid,

06:05.498 --> 06:06.760
have you missed me?

06:06.833 --> 06:08.892
Percy did.
I paid him a visit. "

06:08.968 --> 06:09.900
He's taunting me.

06:09.969 --> 06:12.096
This note would suggest
you, the killer, and the victim

06:12.171 --> 06:13.365
had a relationship of some sort.

06:13.439 --> 06:15.703
Percy Pollack and I have
crossed paths with lots of men

06:15.775 --> 06:17.766
who didn't particularly want to
see the inside of a jail cell.

06:17.844 --> 06:19.436
Would any of them
want to see you dead?

06:19.512 --> 06:21.480
Dozens.

06:23.316 --> 06:24.681
Right, then.

06:26.819 --> 06:30.550
Time to perform
the messy part of the job.

06:35.361 --> 06:37.693
Hello, Molly.
We're here to see Clara.

06:37.764 --> 06:39.994
No. No.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.296
Clara.

06:42.368 --> 06:43.630
Clara.

06:44.837 --> 06:46.702
Shhh, shhh.

06:46.839 --> 06:48.033
Hey.

06:49.675 --> 06:51.575
Shhh, shhh.

06:58.284 --> 06:59.478
Thank you.

06:59.552 --> 07:01.076
This will help.

07:09.662 --> 07:11.960
Why would anyone do this
to Percy?

07:12.031 --> 07:13.623
We don't know, Clara.

07:13.699 --> 07:16.964
Mrs. Pollack, had he any trouble
with any cases recently?

07:17.036 --> 07:18.401
An accused, perhaps?

07:19.605 --> 07:21.937
He was a lawyer.
There was always little things.

07:22.008 --> 07:26.069
But nothing
that would suggest... this.

07:26.145 --> 07:27.874
When was the last time
you saw him?

07:27.947 --> 07:30.347
- A week ago.
- A week ago?

07:30.416 --> 07:33.613
He was taking the train
to Montreal.

07:33.686 --> 07:35.711
Something to do with some case.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.585
Wait.

07:37.657 --> 07:40.217
He was going to make a stop
before leaving.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.487
Any idea where?

07:41.561 --> 07:45.497
At a business meeting.

07:45.565 --> 07:47.089
Outside of Mimico.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.599
You have an address?

07:50.603 --> 07:53.231
Thomas, I think
I'm going to be sick.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.372
Thank you, Molly.

08:03.916 --> 08:05.178
Will she be all right?

08:05.251 --> 08:08.084
She has a sister
coming to stay with her.

08:08.154 --> 08:11.021
There's no way Percy Pollack
was in that trunk for a week.

08:11.090 --> 08:12.318
No.

08:12.391 --> 08:14.825
We need to know when he died
and where he was in the interim.

08:14.894 --> 08:16.828
Doctor Ogden will supply
the time of death.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.295
I'll retrace his steps.

08:18.364 --> 08:20.161
I'll go over the cases
Percy and I worked on,

08:20.233 --> 08:21.495
see if I can come up
with a name.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.228
Very good.

08:23.302 --> 08:25.065
Murdoch...

08:25.137 --> 08:26.604
I want this bastard caught.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.230
Understood.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.746
Excuse me!

09:11.083 --> 09:12.607
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

09:12.685 --> 09:13.947
Dr. Gilbert Birkins?

09:14.020 --> 09:15.214
Yes!

09:15.288 --> 09:17.722
Detective William Murdoch,
Toronto Police.

09:19.158 --> 09:22.286
Police?

09:22.361 --> 09:24.761
What are you doing all the way
out here in Mimico?

09:32.238 --> 09:35.298
It's the way of the future.
Percy thought so too.

09:35.374 --> 09:36.568
Mechanical power, I mean.

09:36.642 --> 09:38.371
The horse
is a thing of the past.

09:38.444 --> 09:40.969
Yes, well, a device like this
has some advantages.

09:41.047 --> 09:42.947
Some, Detective?
Why, this is liberation.

09:43.015 --> 09:44.710
Anyone can travel
wherever they desire.

09:44.784 --> 09:45.910
Well, I understand,

09:45.985 --> 09:48.783
but a world full of mechanized
vehicles like this...

09:48.854 --> 09:51.254
The fumes alone, let alone the
roads needed to carry them...

09:51.324 --> 09:53.383
It's all quite manageable,
if it's thought through.

09:53.459 --> 09:55.620
Yes, "if. "

09:55.695 --> 09:58.220
So you and Mr. Pollack
were business associates?

10:00.199 --> 10:01.461
Partners.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.934
Pioneers in the
mechanized-bicycle business.

10:04.003 --> 10:07.439
Percy was one of the few men
I knew who shared my passion.

10:07.506 --> 10:09.838
Mr. Pollack visited you
before he left for Montreal?

10:09.909 --> 10:11.137
He came up for a brief meeting

10:11.210 --> 10:13.144
about some milling work
to be done on a cylinder.

10:13.212 --> 10:15.373
- Was anything bothering him?
- Not that I'm aware of.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.474
No, in fact, he seemed
in exceptional spirits.

10:19.318 --> 10:22.776
Do you know of anyone who might
have wanted to harm Mr. Pollack?

10:24.390 --> 10:26.017
Harm Percy?

10:26.993 --> 10:29.291
Couldn't imagine it.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.456
And the last you saw of him?

10:31.530 --> 10:34.055
Stepping into a coach
bound for the city.

10:35.768 --> 10:39.204
Right, then. Should I need to
get in touch with you again...

10:39.271 --> 10:41.330
I, uh...
I'm mostly here.

10:41.407 --> 10:43.534
I still practice medicine
in Toronto.

10:43.609 --> 10:46.578
Even Renaissance men
need to pay the bills.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.971
Oh.
You have a telephone out here?

10:50.049 --> 10:51.482
In case I'm needed
for my patients.

10:51.550 --> 10:54.314
- If you'll excuse me.
- Of course.

11:07.733 --> 11:09.598
Yeah, I remember him.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.694
I took him out to a farm
in Mimico.

11:11.771 --> 11:14.069
I remember it because there was
this noisy bike

11:14.140 --> 11:15.835
that scared the tar
out of my horse.

11:15.908 --> 11:19.674
- Then you came back to the city?
- Dropped him at Union Station.

11:52.478 --> 11:55.470
Perfect timing.
Just finishing with our patient.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.038
And?

11:57.149 --> 11:59.117
The cause of death
was massive blood loss

11:59.151 --> 12:01.051
due to a single puncture wound
to the heart.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.680
- And the weapon?
- A narrow-bladed knife.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.280
I think the killer
knew what he was doing.

12:05.357 --> 12:06.415
What makes you say that?

12:06.492 --> 12:07.925
There's no bruising
around the wound.

12:07.993 --> 12:10.655
He realized there was no need
to drive the weapon to the hilt.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.357
As if he had done it before.

12:12.431 --> 12:14.126
Were there any defensive wounds?

12:14.200 --> 12:17.033
None. Perhaps the killer
surprised Mr. Pollack.

12:17.103 --> 12:19.230
That, or the victim
and killer knew each other.

12:19.305 --> 12:21.603
Did you find any fibers
or hairs?

12:21.674 --> 12:22.800
No hair.

12:22.875 --> 12:25.537
But I did find this
in the scalp.

12:27.113 --> 12:28.876
- Sawdust?
- Precisely.

12:28.948 --> 12:30.540
Where did he pick that up?

12:30.616 --> 12:32.675
Perhaps a construction site
or sawmill?

12:32.752 --> 12:34.447
Anywhere where
there was carpentry.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.612
And the time of death?

12:35.688 --> 12:37.918
Based on decay,
discoloration, rigor,

12:37.990 --> 12:40.015
I'd say 36 to 48 hours ago.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.258
Interesting.
He was last seen a week ago.

12:43.329 --> 12:45.627
That leaves five days
unaccounted for.

12:46.732 --> 12:49.701
There's one last thing.
I found these in the wound.

12:50.736 --> 12:52.203
Pupae.

12:52.271 --> 12:56.002
- Any idea what species?
- Entomology is not my field.

12:57.576 --> 12:58.975
Thank you for these.

12:59.044 --> 13:01.342
It's my pleasure.

13:04.483 --> 13:05.541
Could you have the operator

13:05.618 --> 13:07.176
connect me
to Lawson's Butchery, please?

13:07.253 --> 13:08.515
Right away, sir.

13:19.965 --> 13:20.897
Sir?

13:20.966 --> 13:24.231
Chief Constable Stockton's
office called for you earlier.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.565
Mmh. Did they?

13:25.638 --> 13:28.004
Something about
an appointment this afternoon?

13:28.908 --> 13:30.068
Oh.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.700
Yes, of course.
I almost forgot.

13:31.777 --> 13:33.506
Thank you, George.

13:36.582 --> 13:38.709
Yes, this is
Detective William Murdoch

13:38.784 --> 13:40.274
at Police Station Number Four.

13:40.352 --> 13:41.979
I'd like to place an order,
please.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.147
Nova Scotia, eh?

13:46.225 --> 13:48.125
Yes, sir.
That's where I was born.

13:48.194 --> 13:51.220
- What'd your father do?
- He was a fisherman, sir.

13:51.297 --> 13:53.857
- Still out there?
- We've lost touch.

13:53.933 --> 13:55.457
Oh.

13:55.534 --> 13:56.899
And your mother?

13:57.002 --> 13:59.300
My mother passed away
when I was just a lad.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.600
Ah.

14:02.441 --> 14:04.272
You joined the force
10 years ago.

14:05.778 --> 14:07.439
Where were you before that?

14:07.513 --> 14:09.504
I worked in a lumber camp
up north.

14:09.582 --> 14:12.676
I went there from Montreal,
stayed two winters.

14:12.751 --> 14:15.549
I met a lumberman there who had
done a stint as a constable.

14:15.621 --> 14:19.113
I liked the sounds of it,
so I applied.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.058
What makes you think
you'd make a good inspector?

14:22.127 --> 14:23.924
I spent five years
as a constable

14:23.996 --> 14:27.124
before becoming acting detective
at Station House Number Four.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.463
I was promoted to full detective
three years ago.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.400
I've headed up
36 murder investigations

14:31.470 --> 14:33.700
and achieved convictions
in all but two.

14:33.772 --> 14:36.639
- I get on well with the men.
- Very impressive.

14:37.576 --> 14:39.373
Marital status?

14:39.445 --> 14:41.310
Bachelor.

14:42.348 --> 14:44.908
I was engaged to Liza Milner.

14:44.984 --> 14:47.509
She passed away
just over a year ago.

14:49.521 --> 14:51.113
My condolences.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.820
Well...

14:55.261 --> 14:57.320
What else should I know
about you?

14:57.429 --> 14:59.090
Sir, I like to read.

14:59.131 --> 15:01.565
Mostly medical
and scientific journals.

15:01.634 --> 15:04.694
I'm strong, healthy, punctual.

15:04.770 --> 15:07.238
- Religious affiliation?
- Roman Catholic.

15:07.306 --> 15:09.740
I can only attend
but once or twice a week,

15:09.808 --> 15:12.333
but I try to make confession
as often as possible.

15:14.847 --> 15:18.180
Well, Inspector Brackenreid
gives you a fine report.

15:18.250 --> 15:22.482
I think that's all I need from
you at the moment, Detective.

15:22.554 --> 15:26.046
All sounds very impressive.
I'll let you know.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.524
Thank you.

15:38.037 --> 15:39.732
Sir?

15:39.805 --> 15:41.272
George, please don't
sneak up on me.

15:41.340 --> 15:43.604
Sorry about that.
What are you doing?

15:43.676 --> 15:45.940
Inspecting the note
the killer left with the body.

15:46.011 --> 15:48.377
- Anything to be learned?
- Unfortunately not.

15:48.447 --> 15:49.914
It was written
using a straightedge,

15:49.982 --> 15:52.576
so it's impossible to link it
to a suspect's handwriting.

15:52.651 --> 15:55.279
The paper's commonly available,
as is the trunk.

15:55.354 --> 15:56.753
I could try to raise
fingermarks.

15:56.855 --> 15:58.152
Already tried it, George.

15:58.190 --> 16:00.715
No marks on the paper, and the
trunk is heavily smudged.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.626
- What about on your end?
- I spoke with the stationmaster.

16:03.696 --> 16:04.628
And?

16:04.697 --> 16:06.562
Mr. Pollack did have a ticket
for Montreal,

16:06.632 --> 16:07.792
but it was never used.

16:09.335 --> 16:12.668
So he was dropped at the station
but never boarded the train.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.474
- What became of him?
- Murdoch.

16:17.543 --> 16:18.942
Get your hat.

16:22.748 --> 16:24.010
Thomas.

16:24.083 --> 16:26.017
- Where is it?
- In the study.

16:28.787 --> 16:30.049
- Father!
- Father!

16:30.122 --> 16:32.113
- Whoa!
- Guess what I did today!

16:32.191 --> 16:34.022
I'll tell you what...
You can tell me later.

16:34.093 --> 16:35.890
But at the minute,
Daddy's really busy,

16:35.961 --> 16:37.121
so go to your mother.

16:37.196 --> 16:39.221
You come here
and let your father be.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.535
The missus found it when she got
back from the Ladies Auxiliary.

16:47.606 --> 16:49.130
- I see.
- Is it for me?

16:49.208 --> 16:50.903
John!
Get away from that trunk!

16:50.976 --> 16:53.945
Listen, I didn't mean
to shout at you.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.072
But that's a present
for your father.

16:56.148 --> 16:57.513
Margaret.

16:58.617 --> 16:59.879
Come.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.250
It's addressed to you, sir.

17:29.114 --> 17:30.809
First, Percy Pollack, lawyer.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.748
And now Judge Henry Scott.

17:32.818 --> 17:33.910
It would seem as though

17:33.986 --> 17:36.079
someone has it in
for officers of the court

17:36.155 --> 17:39.124
and that the next target
is you, sir.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.924
Gentlemen,
I have preliminary results.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.393
Judge Scott died from...

17:43.462 --> 17:46.488
A wound almost identical to the
one that killed Percy Pollack.

17:46.565 --> 17:47.623
That's right.

17:47.699 --> 17:50.896
The weapon was a narrow-bladed
knife, possibly a...

17:50.969 --> 17:53.938
- Stiletto.
- That would be consistent, yes.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.598
Uh, the blow was delivered...

17:55.674 --> 17:58.768
Between the third and fourth
vertebrosternal ribs.

17:58.877 --> 18:01.539
Is there something you haven't
shared with us, sir?

18:23.368 --> 18:24.357
Scotch?

18:24.436 --> 18:26.097
No, thank you.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.240
There was a case five years ago.

18:30.309 --> 18:33.472
Small-time gangster
named Walter Ayotte.

18:33.545 --> 18:35.445
Smuggling, gambling,
petty theft.

18:35.514 --> 18:37.277
Yes, I remember.

18:37.349 --> 18:39.112
He had no qualms
about getting rid of anyone

18:39.184 --> 18:40.583
who stood in his way.

18:40.652 --> 18:42.984
Stiletto.
That was his trademark.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.888
- Ah, the knife wounds.
- Mmh.

18:45.958 --> 18:46.982
We finally nailed him

18:47.059 --> 18:49.220
on the murder
of his mistress's husband.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.488
I brought him in.

18:50.562 --> 18:52.655
Percy Pollack
was the Crown prosecutor.

18:52.731 --> 18:54.392
Henry Scott was the judge.

18:54.466 --> 18:57.162
He vowed that all three of us
would pay.

18:57.269 --> 18:59.635
I made inspector
because of that case.

18:59.671 --> 19:01.969
But Walter Ayotte
can't be our man.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.701
I remember he died
in a jailbreak.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.140
Did he?

19:05.210 --> 19:07.110
You're suggesting he didn't?

19:07.179 --> 19:09.477
I'm not suggesting.

19:09.548 --> 19:11.743
Sir, if Ayotte is still alive,

19:11.817 --> 19:14.479
then we should assign
a man or two to protect you.

19:14.553 --> 19:17.750
What do you think I am?
A frightened schoolgirl?

19:17.823 --> 19:21.156
No, sir. It's just that you are
the last name on his list.

19:21.226 --> 19:24.093
The criminals don't dictate
to this police force.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.427
I'll look after myself, Murdoch.

19:29.434 --> 19:30.731
Cheers.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.203
Listen up, lads.

19:35.274 --> 19:39.108
This piece of filth's name
is Walter Ayotte.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.738
I want every tavern,
every brothel,

19:41.813 --> 19:43.872
every gambling den
in and around the city

19:43.949 --> 19:45.712
scoured for Ayotte
and his cronies.

19:45.784 --> 19:47.809
I want anyone
who's ever had anything to do

19:47.886 --> 19:49.683
with this two-bit gobshite
questioned.

19:49.755 --> 19:53.122
Sir, Ayotte's pals aren't
exactly the type to squeal.

19:54.259 --> 19:57.023
If you can't make him talk,
I will!

19:57.095 --> 19:59.620
- Now get out there!
- Sir.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.029
- Sir, a word.
- What is it?!

20:01.099 --> 20:02.259
Sir, I don't believe

20:02.334 --> 20:04.393
that such a strong-handed
approach is the right one.

20:04.469 --> 20:05.458
- Oh, you don't?
- No.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.164
Perhaps it would be best
if we didn't let on

20:07.239 --> 20:08.729
that we know
that Ayotte's still alive.

20:08.807 --> 20:09.899
Is that what you think?

20:09.975 --> 20:11.840
You'd rather wait
till Ayotte strikes again?

20:11.910 --> 20:13.343
No, sir, but there are
dissimilarities

20:13.412 --> 20:14.344
between the two murders.

20:14.413 --> 20:17.211
The knife, the wound... They're
Ayotte through and through.

20:17.282 --> 20:18.943
Granted, but I think
there's more to this

20:19.017 --> 20:20.041
than meets the eye...

20:20.118 --> 20:22.143
the pupae recovered,
the time of death.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.688
Let me make this clear,
Detective.

20:23.755 --> 20:25.655
If you want to spend your time
dilly-dallying

20:25.724 --> 20:27.521
on your modern little theories,
feel free.

20:27.593 --> 20:30.562
But I'm gonna find Ayotte
before he finds me.

20:42.274 --> 20:44.174
The last of
the jailbreak files, sir.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.505
Excellent.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.439
Has something gone off in here?

20:48.513 --> 20:51.038
- What?
- That smell.

20:51.116 --> 20:52.777
I don't smell anything.

20:54.419 --> 20:55.886
Here it is.

20:55.954 --> 20:58.422
Don Jail.
June 10, 1890.

20:58.523 --> 21:00.718
Prison riot and jailbreak.

21:00.759 --> 21:03.990
Fire broke out in the kitchen,
spread to the cell area.

21:04.062 --> 21:05.689
Two prisoners
managed to scale a wall.

21:05.764 --> 21:06.890
Suspected escapees

21:06.965 --> 21:08.523
are Carson O'Day
and Daniel Vitacelli.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.125
I believe those two
are still on the loose, sir.

21:11.203 --> 21:13.194
Badly charred body
of one inmate was found,

21:13.272 --> 21:15.832
that of Walter Ayotte,
convicted murderer.

21:16.842 --> 21:18.173
How badly charred, I wonder.

21:18.243 --> 21:20.177
Badly enough that the doctor
doing the postmortem

21:20.245 --> 21:21.712
may have mistaken his identity?

21:21.780 --> 21:24.613
Only one way to find out.
I want that body exhumed.

21:24.683 --> 21:26.651
Right away.
And you, sir?

21:26.718 --> 21:29.186
I'm going to try to determine
Judge Scott's whereabouts

21:29.254 --> 21:30.414
before he was killed.

21:32.257 --> 21:33.918
Come on!
Come on!

21:33.992 --> 21:36.119
Hey.
What's all this, then?

21:37.062 --> 21:40.031
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Delmer Ward.

21:40.098 --> 21:42.032
Pleasure to see you again,
Delmer.

21:44.169 --> 21:46.069
I see the feeling's not mutual.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.333
But I'm sure that I'll soon
win you 'round.

21:48.407 --> 21:49.533
Get him in the back, lads.

21:49.608 --> 21:51.508
Come on.

22:00.385 --> 22:04.082
Judge Scott was a gentleman
through and through.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.420
I can't imagine
who would want him dead.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.982
Had he recently mentioned
a man named Ayotte?

22:09.061 --> 22:10.028
No.

22:10.095 --> 22:12.723
- Nothing unusual?
- No.

22:12.798 --> 22:15.232
What about the judge's family...
his wife, children...

22:15.300 --> 22:16.665
Might they be able to help me?

22:16.735 --> 22:19.431
Mrs. Scott passed on
several years ago.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.768
It was a great tragedy
for the judge.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.035
They didn't have any children.

22:24.109 --> 22:26.100
Female troubles, I heard.

22:27.112 --> 22:29.580
What can you tell me about
the judge's activities that day?

22:29.648 --> 22:32.583
He was in court
and then left at end of day.

22:32.651 --> 22:35.484
- Nothing out of the ordinary?
- No.

22:36.555 --> 22:38.250
Wait.

22:38.323 --> 22:40.382
Wait, there was
that telephone call.

22:40.459 --> 22:41.858
What about it?

22:41.927 --> 22:45.226
The judge received a telephone
call about half past 4:00.

22:45.297 --> 22:48.198
And there was something unusual
about this call?

22:48.266 --> 22:51.360
Well, I-I'm just
the judge's secretary,

22:51.436 --> 22:54.462
but, uh, it was from a woman.

22:54.539 --> 22:57.099
Do you have any idea
who placed the call?

22:57.209 --> 23:02.010
No. But, uh, whoever it was,
she sounded upset.

23:06.585 --> 23:09.986
So, me old mucker,
anything coming back to you?

23:10.055 --> 23:11.716
Any sudden rush of memories?

23:14.292 --> 23:17.056
I can do this
a lot longer than you can.

23:20.866 --> 23:22.527
Have it your way, then.

23:27.539 --> 23:31.031
I relent.
I relent.

23:31.109 --> 23:32.474
Good boy, Delmer.

23:32.544 --> 23:34.569
Good boy.

23:38.917 --> 23:39.884
George.

23:39.951 --> 23:41.748
Judge Scott received
a telephone call

23:41.820 --> 23:42.912
the afternoon he was murdered.

23:42.988 --> 23:44.580
I need you to find out
where it came from.

23:44.656 --> 23:47.591
- That can be done?
- I don't see why not.

23:47.659 --> 23:49.126
Murdoch.

23:49.194 --> 23:51.560
You may have your fancy-dan way
of doing things,

23:51.630 --> 23:54.565
but sometimes my way
can be very effective.

24:06.178 --> 24:08.669
He's been here recently.
It's still fresh.

24:08.747 --> 24:11.648
Sergeant Mulligan,
I want every available man

24:11.716 --> 24:13.684
searching the surrounding area.

24:13.752 --> 24:16.152
Someone's tipped Ayotte off.

24:16.221 --> 24:17.779
But who?

24:17.856 --> 24:21.917
We've got Ward still locked up
tight down at the station, so...

24:25.263 --> 24:27.231
- Sir, wait!
- What?

24:27.299 --> 24:28.630
Trip wire.

24:30.101 --> 24:32.661
May I see your walking stick?

24:32.737 --> 24:33.999
Pardon me.

24:40.645 --> 24:41.976
Bloody hell.

24:49.387 --> 24:50.752
Aah!

24:50.822 --> 24:52.187
Come here, Delmer!
Come here!

24:55.527 --> 24:58.189
You set me up,
you shifty little bastard!

24:58.296 --> 25:00.992
Now I'm gonna tell
you something, sunshine.

25:01.032 --> 25:02.863
I'm gonna make you wish
you hadn't!

25:02.934 --> 25:06.267
Now, where is Ayotte really at?!

25:06.338 --> 25:07.362
Huh?!

25:07.439 --> 25:10.408
Go ahead.
Do your worst.

25:10.475 --> 25:15.037
I'd rather take my chances with
you than face Ayotte's knife.

25:24.155 --> 25:26.123
Ayotte and Ward.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.988
They were in this together.

25:32.330 --> 25:34.321
They knew that I'd come to Ward
looking for Ayotte,

25:34.399 --> 25:36.333
and they knew that I'd be eager.

25:36.401 --> 25:38.028
Perhaps too eager.

25:38.103 --> 25:40.867
But I won't be making
the same mistake again.

25:40.939 --> 25:42.236
Sir, it's clear Delmer Ward

25:42.307 --> 25:43.706
won't be telling you
anything further.

25:43.775 --> 25:45.242
Oh, he'll talk, all right.

25:45.310 --> 25:46.368
Should he not?

25:46.444 --> 25:48.036
Well, then,
some other bugger will!

25:48.113 --> 25:49.740
With all due respect, sir,

25:49.814 --> 25:51.714
you can beat every crooked man
in this city,

25:51.783 --> 25:53.546
but I don't believe
you'll find Ayotte that way.

25:53.618 --> 25:55.609
He's covered his tracks
too well.

25:56.788 --> 25:57.982
So, what do you suggest?

25:58.056 --> 25:59.648
I suggest
we follow the evidence.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.351
And just what evidence
might that be?

26:01.426 --> 26:02.950
Well, there are
a number of leads.

26:03.028 --> 26:05.519
But, to me, the key still seems
to be the time of death.

26:05.597 --> 26:07.030
Yes, yes,
you keep telling me this,

26:07.098 --> 26:08.258
but I've yet to see a result.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.665
If you'll bear with me,
I just need a bit more time.

26:10.735 --> 26:12.032
I will get
to the bottom of this.

26:12.103 --> 26:13.035
Time.

26:13.104 --> 26:15.971
Time's not something
that I have a lot of.

26:16.041 --> 26:18.305
I believe
it's our best course of action.

26:18.376 --> 26:19.900
Fine.

26:19.978 --> 26:22.572
But I want to know everything
you come up with. Understood?

26:22.647 --> 26:23.579
Yes, of course.

26:23.648 --> 26:26.082
And, again, I suggest a couple
of men be assigned to you.

26:26.151 --> 26:27.083
Sod that!

26:27.152 --> 26:28.813
There might not be much
I can do right now.

26:28.887 --> 26:30.184
But if Walter Ayotte
comes looking

26:30.255 --> 26:31.950
and expects me to go quietly,

26:32.023 --> 26:33.513
then he's got
another think coming.

26:44.235 --> 26:45.224
Detective.

26:46.972 --> 26:48.735
What on Earth is that odor?

26:48.807 --> 26:51.173
Perhaps something
has died in the walls.

26:51.242 --> 26:52.971
A mouse or a rat or something.

26:53.044 --> 26:54.773
I don't think there's
any perhaps about it.

26:54.846 --> 26:55.835
How can you stand it?

26:55.914 --> 26:57.506
I suppose I've become
accustomed to it.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.743
Yeah, or lost
your sense of smell.

26:59.784 --> 27:02.116
- Shall we step outside?
- Yes.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.586
Oh, much better.

27:05.657 --> 27:07.181
I've finished
with the exhumed remains.

27:07.258 --> 27:08.225
Ah. And?

27:08.293 --> 27:10.284
The bone structure
is too small to be Ayotte.

27:10.362 --> 27:13.798
But it is consistent with one of
the other escapees... Vitacelli.

27:13.865 --> 27:16.129
So Vitacelli is killed,
his body burned.

27:16.201 --> 27:17.828
The doctor performing
the postmortem

27:17.902 --> 27:20.769
misidentifies the corpse as
Ayotte, allowing him to escape.

27:20.839 --> 27:22.898
I find it hard to believe
a doctor worth his letters

27:22.974 --> 27:24.635
would make that kind of mistake.

27:24.709 --> 27:26.176
So do I.
Let me look into it.

27:26.244 --> 27:27.302
I'd appreciate that.

27:27.379 --> 27:30.143
- So is it true?
- Is what true?

27:31.516 --> 27:33.245
That you've applied
for a new position.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.547
Yes.

27:37.188 --> 27:40.123
Well, I-I would be sorry
to see you leave.

27:40.191 --> 27:42.591
Sir? Sir.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.426
It took some work, but I found
Judge Scott's caller.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.659
I think I'll call the technique
I used "tracing. "

27:48.733 --> 27:51.463
I had the operator
literally trace the wires

27:51.536 --> 27:52.798
from the switchboard.

27:52.871 --> 27:54.600
Yes, yes, fine.
Do you have a name?

27:54.673 --> 27:57.801
I do.
And it may surprise you.

27:59.511 --> 28:02.036
So why did you call Judge Scott?

28:02.113 --> 28:06.072
I needed some advice...
legal advice.

28:06.151 --> 28:11.521
And so I called Henry, and he
agreed to come by the house.

28:11.589 --> 28:14.114
When I saw the paper
the next day...

28:23.168 --> 28:26.626
First Percy.
And now Henry.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.536
What time did
Judge Scott arrive?

28:28.606 --> 28:30.471
Straight after
he'd finished work.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.533
- How long did he stay?
- Perhaps half an hour.

28:32.610 --> 28:34.908
Did he give any indication
as to where he was going?

28:34.979 --> 28:37.777
Home. I remember he said
he had had a long day.

28:37.849 --> 28:39.976
- Did he seem anxious, off?
- No.

28:41.486 --> 28:44.080
This advice you were seeking...
What was it?

28:44.155 --> 28:48.615
Percy had made a large
investment just before he died.

28:48.693 --> 28:50.888
Practically all of our savings.

28:50.962 --> 28:53.157
An investment.
What kind?

28:53.231 --> 28:54.528
That...

28:55.800 --> 28:59.395
...pardon my language...
darned motorcycle business.

28:59.504 --> 29:00.801
With Dr. Birkins?

29:00.839 --> 29:04.570
What if the venture fails?
I could be left destitute.

29:04.642 --> 29:07.543
And so I asked Henry for advice.

29:07.612 --> 29:10.172
This investment...
It was a surprise to you?

29:10.248 --> 29:11.909
I knew that Percy
was considering it,

29:11.983 --> 29:14.349
but I hoped
that he had changed his mind.

29:14.419 --> 29:15.784
Why?

29:22.727 --> 29:25.491
He was concerned
about a previous venture

29:25.563 --> 29:27.155
that had not gone so well.

29:27.232 --> 29:29.757
This previous venture...
Do you know what it was?

29:31.002 --> 29:32.230
I don't know.

29:32.303 --> 29:35.670
Only that it was another one
of Dr. Birkins' inventions.

29:36.508 --> 29:37.634
Look at this.

29:37.709 --> 29:39.677
The self-pouring teapot.

29:39.744 --> 29:41.735
Pours a steaming-hot cup of tea

29:41.813 --> 29:44.373
without you ever having
to touch the pot.

29:45.650 --> 29:47.641
Thank God.

29:47.719 --> 29:50.210
What will they think of next?

29:50.288 --> 29:51.755
Oh, you'll like this one, sir.

29:51.823 --> 29:54.724
A bicycle tire
is engraved with lettering

29:54.793 --> 29:56.852
so that you can
leave messages behind

29:56.928 --> 29:58.555
when you ride
through the mud.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.120
George.

30:04.135 --> 30:07.866
So I heard you were interviewed
for that inspector's position.

30:09.574 --> 30:12.099
Obviously,
a very poorly kept secret.

30:12.177 --> 30:16.443
Well, on behalf of myself
and the lads, it's, uh...

30:16.514 --> 30:18.004
It's been an honor
working with you.

30:18.082 --> 30:19.447
It was just an interview,
George.

30:19.517 --> 30:20.677
Oh, you're a shoo-in, sir.

30:21.953 --> 30:24.421
Let's just concentrate on
the task at hand, shall we?

30:27.592 --> 30:29.025
Ah, here it is.

30:30.562 --> 30:35.932
"Dr. G. Birkins, applicant.
Patent number 405060."

30:36.000 --> 30:37.865
- What's it for?
- Corn shards.

30:37.936 --> 30:40.700
"A breakfast product made
from reconstituted corn pulp,

30:40.772 --> 30:43.002
meant to be eaten
with cold milk. "

30:43.074 --> 30:46.271
That sounds revolting.

30:46.344 --> 30:49.871
You know, I had an idea once
to put meat in a can.

30:49.948 --> 30:50.972
Think about it.

30:51.049 --> 30:54.416
You could send it halfway across
the world if you wanted to.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.174
Corn shards weren't a bad idea.

31:17.242 --> 31:19.710
I'm sure they would have taken
off if that Kellogg fellow

31:19.777 --> 31:21.540
hadn't got his product
on the market first.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.342
Causing your venture to fail.

31:23.414 --> 31:25.575
That and my backers
getting cold feet.

31:25.650 --> 31:27.709
I think they made
a very large mistake.

31:27.785 --> 31:30.515
But only time will tell.

31:30.588 --> 31:34.354
Had Mr. Pollack gotten cold feet
about the motorcycle venture?

31:34.425 --> 31:37.189
Percy had questions.
Any good businessman would.

31:37.262 --> 31:38.456
Is that what you two discussed

31:38.529 --> 31:39.860
when he came out
to meet with you?

31:39.931 --> 31:40.989
It came up.

31:41.065 --> 31:42.999
But we ironed out
our differences.

31:43.067 --> 31:45.262
So he decided to make
a sizable investment?

31:45.336 --> 31:46.303
$5,000.

31:46.371 --> 31:48.236
- That's a fortune.
- Well, to some.

31:48.306 --> 31:50.740
To others, those with foresight,

31:50.808 --> 31:52.799
the rewards far exceeded
the risk.

31:52.877 --> 31:55.175
And what was Mr. Pollack's
investment to accomplish?

31:55.246 --> 31:56.804
The final adjustments
to the prototype

31:56.915 --> 31:58.405
in the first phase
of production.

31:58.449 --> 32:01.418
Look, the bank wired the money
through the day after we met.

32:10.461 --> 32:13.055
So the money arrived
the day after they met?

32:13.131 --> 32:16.100
Yes. Also the day after
he was last seen alive.

32:16.167 --> 32:17.657
- Curious, isn't it?
- Mmh.

32:17.735 --> 32:18.861
But how does it affect matters?

32:18.937 --> 32:21.428
The time of death was determined
to be a few days later.

32:21.506 --> 32:23.269
Something about that
is bothering me as well.

32:23.341 --> 32:25.366
Surely you're not questioning
Dr. Ogden's finding.

32:25.443 --> 32:26.410
Not at all.

32:26.477 --> 32:29.469
I believe her interpretation
of the facts was accurate.

32:29.547 --> 32:31.811
But she can only reach
an accurate conclusion

32:31.883 --> 32:34.351
if provided with all of
the necessary information.

32:34.419 --> 32:36.046
And how much information
was she missing?

32:36.120 --> 32:38.384
I'm not completely certain.
Yet.

32:38.456 --> 32:40.117
However, if I'm not mistaken,

32:40.191 --> 32:41.852
I believe the stork
has paid me a visit.

32:41.926 --> 32:42.984
Of sorts.

32:49.067 --> 32:50.967
William.
You wanted to see me?

32:51.035 --> 32:52.798
Oh, my!

32:52.870 --> 32:55.566
I really must insist
that you do something

32:55.640 --> 32:57.437
about whatever has died
in your walls!

32:57.542 --> 32:59.737
Nothing has died.

33:00.445 --> 33:01.503
It's liver rotting.

33:01.579 --> 33:02.978
I've been conducting
an experiment,

33:03.047 --> 33:05.038
and you're just in time.

33:05.116 --> 33:08.950
The pupae recovered from
Pollack's wound have hatched.

33:09.020 --> 33:10.749
June bugs.

33:12.757 --> 33:14.281
According to this,
the pupal form

33:14.359 --> 33:16.020
has an 18-day incubation period

33:16.094 --> 33:17.527
before hatching
into adult beetles.

33:18.796 --> 33:22.288
The june bug pupae virtually
all hatch on the same day.

33:22.367 --> 33:25.063
Yes, I spoke to an entomologist
at the University of Toronto,

33:25.136 --> 33:27.434
and he told me that
they all hatched five days ago.

33:27.505 --> 33:29.302
But your june bugs
hatched today.

33:29.374 --> 33:32.172
Yes.
What could cause that?

33:32.243 --> 33:34.211
Well, there could be
a number of factors

33:34.278 --> 33:36.371
that could cause a delay
in their development, I suppose.

33:36.447 --> 33:38.074
A cold snap, for example.

33:38.149 --> 33:40.344
But the weather
has been singularly hot.

33:47.959 --> 33:49.358
Percy Pollack was stabbed.

33:50.895 --> 33:53.591
His body was left on the ground
for some time.

33:53.664 --> 33:56.861
That's how the june bug pupae
got into the wound.

33:56.968 --> 33:58.833
But something delayed
their hatching.

33:58.870 --> 33:59.996
Sawdust.

34:00.872 --> 34:01.804
Excuse me?

34:01.873 --> 34:05.036
You told me you found sawdust
on Pollack's body.

34:05.109 --> 34:07.873
Sawdust is used as insulation
in icehouses.

34:07.945 --> 34:09.139
Which means Pollack's body...

34:09.213 --> 34:10.703
Was kept cold in an icehouse,

34:10.782 --> 34:12.647
causing a delay in the hatching
of the june bugs.

34:12.717 --> 34:13.775
But more importantly,

34:13.851 --> 34:15.819
if we factor in the five days'
delay in hatching,

34:15.887 --> 34:17.752
that would mean Percy
was actually murdered...

34:17.822 --> 34:19.880
The very night
he was to have left Toronto.

34:19.956 --> 34:22.050
And that changes everything.

34:29.600 --> 34:30.965
Like I told you before,
Detective,

34:31.034 --> 34:32.400
I took that fellow
out to the farm

34:32.469 --> 34:34.097
and then dropped him
at the train station.

34:34.172 --> 34:36.139
Yes, well,
now please think hard.

34:36.206 --> 34:38.175
When your fare
came back outside,

34:38.242 --> 34:40.904
did you actually see his face?

34:43.447 --> 34:46.212
Now that I recall,
it was a bit strange.

34:46.284 --> 34:48.650
- What was strange?
- Well, it was a warm evening.

34:48.719 --> 34:51.119
But he had his collar turned up
and his hat pulled low

34:51.188 --> 34:52.315
like he'd taken a chill.

34:52.389 --> 34:55.257
So it may not have been
Mr. Pollack.

34:55.326 --> 34:57.191
I suppose not.

35:01.732 --> 35:03.324
So you're saying
that Pollack died

35:03.401 --> 35:05.232
the night he was
supposed to get on the train.

35:05.303 --> 35:08.238
I don't think Mr. Pollack ever
made it to the train station.

35:08.306 --> 35:09.830
So he was killed
at Birkins' farm,

35:09.907 --> 35:12.307
and then someone impersonating
him got into the cab.

35:12.376 --> 35:14.344
Which would seem to suggest
some association

35:14.412 --> 35:16.107
between Ayotte and Dr. Birkins.

35:16.180 --> 35:18.273
Why would Birkins
want Percy Pollack dead?

35:18.349 --> 35:20.010
Mr. Pollack
was having reservations

35:20.084 --> 35:21.176
about the business deal.

35:21.252 --> 35:22.810
I believe he wanted out.

35:22.887 --> 35:25.151
So Birkins has Ayotte
kill Pollack

35:25.223 --> 35:26.747
to keep him from backing out
of the deal.

35:26.824 --> 35:28.985
Yes, but Dr. Birkins still
needed Mr. Pollack's money.

35:29.060 --> 35:32.086
So he put the body on ice,
delaying the time of death,

35:32.163 --> 35:33.892
until the transaction
was completed.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.023
And then Pollack's found

35:35.099 --> 35:36.760
tragically murdered
just days later.

35:36.834 --> 35:38.495
Never to see the results
of his investment.

35:38.569 --> 35:40.867
I'd like to revisit
the suspected crime scene.

35:40.938 --> 36:06.594
Keep an eye out, me old mucker.

36:12.503 --> 36:15.495
Ah, the Ayotte postmortem files.
Thank you.

36:28.986 --> 36:30.112
Inspector?

36:31.322 --> 36:33.313
Chief Constable.
Please come in.

36:33.391 --> 36:36.087
- Can I get you tea, sir?
- No, thank you.

36:36.160 --> 36:37.957
I'm looking
for Detective Murdoch.

36:38.029 --> 36:40.964
He's off investigating a new
development in the Pollack case.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.124
New development, eh?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.667
Yes, we have reason to believe

36:43.734 --> 36:45.565
that Walter Ayotte
wasn't acting alone.

36:45.636 --> 36:47.365
He's looking into it
as we speak.

36:47.438 --> 36:49.133
Murdoch.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.868
Good copper.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.434
But it'll be
a bloody cold day in hell

36:53.511 --> 36:56.969
before a papist becomes an
inspector in my police force.

36:57.081 --> 36:59.845
Sir, Detective Murdoch
is quite exceptional.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.375
- The fact that he's Catholic...
- Thomas.

37:05.256 --> 37:06.951
You're an ambitious man.

37:07.024 --> 37:09.083
And I can see
someday you being an alderman

37:09.160 --> 37:10.559
or maybe even a mayor.

37:11.796 --> 37:14.458
But Toronto
is a Protestant city.

37:16.934 --> 37:20.301
- You'd be wise to remember that.
- Yes, sir.

37:21.539 --> 37:23.837
Give Murdoch the news for me.

37:25.676 --> 37:27.007
Prick.

37:49.300 --> 37:51.996
- Take no chances. Understood?
- Yes, sir.

38:03.147 --> 38:04.205
Dr. Ogden.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.307
Inspector, I was looking
for Detective Murdoch.

38:06.384 --> 38:09.285
Detective Murdoch is conducting
an investigation.

38:09.353 --> 38:11.753
- Can I be of any help?
- Perhaps.

38:13.024 --> 38:15.151
I was puzzled by the postmortem

38:15.226 --> 38:17.091
done on Ayotte's body
after the jailbreak,

38:17.161 --> 38:19.026
so I began looking
through the medical records.

38:19.096 --> 38:20.324
Did you find anything?

38:20.398 --> 38:22.389
I'm not sure.
It may just be a coincidence.

38:22.466 --> 38:24.661
Coppers don't believe
in coincidences.

38:25.936 --> 38:29.099
The postmortem
was performed by Dr. Sherman.

38:29.173 --> 38:30.731
He's dead now,
but Dr. Sherman...

38:30.808 --> 38:34.403
He shared his practice
with Dr. Gilbert Birkins.

38:35.546 --> 38:37.343
That's very interesting, Doctor.

38:37.415 --> 38:39.383
Yes, I-I tried to get him
on the telephone,

38:39.450 --> 38:40.883
but he's busy at his practice.

38:40.951 --> 38:42.942
At his practice?

38:43.020 --> 38:45.511
I think I'll pay
the good doctor a visit.

38:51.028 --> 38:52.893
No one, sir.
They seem to be long gone.

38:52.963 --> 38:54.362
George, is there
an icehouse here?

38:54.432 --> 38:56.627
There is, but I've
searched it already.

39:12.616 --> 39:14.777
As you can see,
there's no one here.

39:17.021 --> 39:18.818
Give me a hand, George.

39:18.889 --> 39:20.356
What are we looking for, sir?

39:21.759 --> 39:25.490
I believe Percy Pollack's body
was stored somewhere cold.

39:26.330 --> 39:27.388
Most likely here.

39:27.465 --> 39:29.797
But how would Ayotte
know to keep the body cold?

39:29.867 --> 39:32.563
He wouldn't.
But Dr. Birkins would.

39:32.636 --> 39:35.434
Then they're in on it together?

39:39.910 --> 39:42.140
Jesus Christ.

39:43.748 --> 39:46.216
Well, we've found Walter Ayotte.

39:47.685 --> 39:49.152
So if Ayotte's dead...

39:50.287 --> 39:52.016
Then the killer must be
Dr. Birkins.

39:52.089 --> 39:55.149
- May I help you?
- Inspector Thomas Brackenreid.

39:55.226 --> 39:58.024
It's regarding the murder
of Percy Pollack.

39:58.095 --> 40:01.064
I see.
Please, come in.

40:03.300 --> 40:04.927
Thank you.

40:06.504 --> 40:07.732
George, we have a problem.

40:07.805 --> 40:10.137
Inspector Brackenreid is
conducting a personal interview

40:10.207 --> 40:11.333
with Dr. Birkins.

40:11.409 --> 40:14.310
He doesn't know that...
The inspector's in grave danger.

40:14.378 --> 40:16.437
- We have to hurry.
- Wait, wait.

40:16.514 --> 40:18.982
We don't have time for that.

40:33.063 --> 40:34.223
I don't know what I can tell you

40:34.298 --> 40:36.266
that I haven't told
Detective Murdoch already.

40:36.333 --> 40:37.925
Well, I've uncovered
some information

40:38.002 --> 40:40.368
that he's not aware of.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.462
Oh?

40:41.539 --> 40:43.871
It concerns Dr. Sherman.

40:46.310 --> 40:47.402
What about him?

40:47.478 --> 40:49.844
You two used to share
this practice, I believe.

40:50.948 --> 40:52.074
What of it?

40:52.149 --> 40:54.879
Well, Dr. Sherman carried out
a postmortem

40:54.952 --> 40:56.510
on a man named Walter Ayotte.

41:05.196 --> 41:06.788
The only problem is

41:06.864 --> 41:09.731
that he didn't actually perform
the postmortem, did he?

41:12.636 --> 41:14.263
What are you talking about?

41:14.338 --> 41:16.932
Well, his name's
on the death certificate.

41:17.007 --> 41:18.872
But you were the one
who actually performed it.

41:18.943 --> 41:21.138
That's how you knew that
Walter Ayotte was still alive.

41:21.212 --> 41:24.670
This is absurd.

41:25.616 --> 41:28.346
Percy wanted to pull out of
your little motorcycle venture.

41:28.419 --> 41:30.717
But you needed his cash,
so you tracked down Ayotte

41:30.788 --> 41:33.018
and got him to do
your dirty work for you.

41:35.359 --> 41:36.986
It was the perfect setup.

41:37.061 --> 41:39.120
Ayotte got his revenge,

41:39.196 --> 41:40.857
and you solved
your cash problems.

41:40.931 --> 41:42.922
All you had to do
was alter the time of the death.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.592
We were about to
change the world.

41:44.668 --> 41:47.694
Percy was worried
about a few dollars.

41:47.771 --> 41:49.830
You think I could
just let him back out?

41:49.907 --> 41:51.033
What about Henry Scott?

41:51.108 --> 41:52.700
He didn't have
anything to do with this.

41:52.776 --> 41:55.142
I never meant for anything
to happen to him.

41:59.283 --> 42:02.844
Look, I never wanted
anyone to die.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.581
Not even Percy.

42:04.655 --> 42:05.883
Where's Ayotte?

42:07.291 --> 42:09.088
He had to be stopped.

42:09.159 --> 42:10.683
Stopped?

42:13.030 --> 42:14.429
Aah!

42:18.536 --> 42:19.468
Sir?

42:19.537 --> 42:22.563
Murdoch.
Good timing.

42:27.011 --> 42:28.603
Well, maybe not.

42:37.955 --> 42:39.422
- Detective?
- Yes, George.

42:39.490 --> 42:41.117
He's coming in.

42:43.694 --> 42:45.924
Hip, hip, hooray!

42:45.996 --> 42:48.931
Hip, hip, hooray!
Hip, hip, hooray!

42:50.401 --> 42:51.868
I'm not back from the grave,

42:51.936 --> 42:53.836
so don't think will curry
any favors with me,

42:53.904 --> 42:55.462
you bunch
of brownnosing bastards!

42:56.740 --> 42:58.367
Murdoch.
Get in my office.

43:05.583 --> 43:06.811
Close the door.

43:09.153 --> 43:10.711
Are you all right, sir?

43:10.788 --> 43:12.483
Course I'm not all right,
you daft bugger.

43:12.556 --> 43:14.490
I've just been in hospital
for two days.

43:14.558 --> 43:16.082
Get me a scotch.

43:17.161 --> 43:18.594
Birkins?

43:18.662 --> 43:20.425
He confessed.

43:20.497 --> 43:22.863
Seems as though he was
in financial trouble

43:22.933 --> 43:24.924
over this corn-shards fiasco.

43:25.002 --> 43:28.301
He needed money,
fell in with a bad lot.

43:28.372 --> 43:31.864
And that is how he met Ayotte
in the first place.

43:32.910 --> 43:34.605
And the judge?

43:34.678 --> 43:37.146
That was Ayotte
acting on his own.

43:37.214 --> 43:38.442
Pull up a chair.

43:40.484 --> 43:43.942
And it appears
you were to be next.

43:44.021 --> 43:47.752
But Dr. Birkins didn't want
Ayotte's rampage to expose him.

43:47.825 --> 43:50.157
- So he killed Ayotte.
- Yes.

43:50.227 --> 43:51.990
And he was going to dispose
of the body,

43:52.062 --> 43:54.860
making it appear as though
Ayotte had moved on or vanished.

43:54.932 --> 43:56.365
Leaving me
looking over my shoulder

43:56.433 --> 43:57.695
for the rest of my life.

43:57.801 --> 44:00.235
I suppose so.

44:00.270 --> 44:03.296
Have you heard about that
job yet that you applied for?

44:03.374 --> 44:05.001
- Not yet.
- I see.

44:06.343 --> 44:08.811
- I'd like you to reconsider.
- Sir?

44:09.813 --> 44:11.474
This is a good station house.

44:11.548 --> 44:13.072
And for reasons beyond me,

44:13.150 --> 44:15.141
the men seem to think
the world of you.

44:15.219 --> 44:16.948
And it's also plain to see

44:17.021 --> 44:19.581
that I could clearly use
a good right-hand...

44:19.657 --> 44:22.319
left-hand man,
keep me out of trouble.

44:22.393 --> 44:25.191
I also suspect that,
as you warned me,

44:25.262 --> 44:29.426
I wouldn't care much for the
politics involved with the job.

44:29.500 --> 44:30.967
No, you wouldn't.

44:33.737 --> 44:36.535
In that case, it would be my
honor to continue to serve here

44:36.607 --> 44:38.131
at Station House Number Four.

44:38.208 --> 44:41.200
I'll inform the chief constable
of your decision.

44:41.278 --> 44:43.041
Thank you, sir.

44:47.818 --> 44:49.445
And the raise, sir?

44:49.520 --> 44:52.216
Don't push your luck, Murdoch.

44:52.289 --> 44:53.950
Right, then.
