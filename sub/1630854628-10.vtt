14:40.760 --> 14:42.760
Her whole family's here for her.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.260
It's just one semester,
isn't it? Three months?

14:47.360 --> 14:49.360
Four. Nearly four.

14:50.160 --> 14:55.120
Yeah, it won't be easy,
but she'll be fine.

14:58.360 --> 15:03.060
Oh, here they are,
the nocturnal adventurers.

15:03.160 --> 15:05.380
Can we have pancakes, Grangie?

15:05.480 --> 15:07.480
With syrup?

15:08.200 --> 15:12.060
I think little girls
who sneak out at night

15:12.160 --> 15:15.380
and almost give
their poor mother a heart attack

15:15.480 --> 15:18.980
do not deserve pancakes.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.080
Uh-uh-uh.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.420
What's going on?

15:34.520 --> 15:36.960
It's time to go.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.100
I've packed your, um, sneakers,

15:46.200 --> 15:48.840
your Eminem shirt, your charger.

15:55.040 --> 15:58.360
It's not the way I wanted
things to go, but, um...

16:01.440 --> 16:04.420
The thing is, Santi,

16:04.520 --> 16:07.580
you're not ready for this

16:07.680 --> 16:10.880
and maybe you never will be.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.820
I'm not gonna be
anyone's backup plan.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.460
-That's not what you are.
-Isn't it?

16:20.560 --> 16:22.560
No.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.880

-Please. Come on!

-Mine, obviously.

17:46.040 --> 17:48.700
-Gabe, no!
-It's too good.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.260
Honestly, man, I can't believe
you came up with this idea.

17:51.360 --> 17:56.000
Gabe, look, you can't
make a kid drink piss!

17:58.480 --> 18:00.780
He dakked me in front of
a bunch of chicks in PE.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.580

with some boy stuff.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.260
Ay, no. Spare me.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.360
I have to go to the big shop
because...

18:18.120 --> 18:20.120
-Ciao.
-'Bye, baby.

18:22.840 --> 18:26.960

to stop while you're ahead.

-Oh, no. He's the donor.

-Oh, you're the partner?
-No, I'm the donor's...friend.

need you to wait outside.

-No.

onto the bed.

had contractions?

more than 12 hours ago?

19:35.960 --> 19:37.500
Yeah.

OK, you're still
only at two centimetres.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.780
I'm afraid we might have to do
an augmentation

19:41.880 --> 19:43.260
to get things moving faster.

19:43.360 --> 19:44.620
OK.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.180
What's an augmentation?

19:46.280 --> 19:48.660
Because I'm not having
an induction.

19:48.760 --> 19:49.940
-It's an induction.
-ARIEL: No.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.980
No, no, no, no!

19:52.080 --> 19:54.060
That's not part of the plan

19:54.160 --> 19:56.860
because I'm having
a natural birth.

be waiting a while.

be here? Do you have PTSD?

take my best friend.

what to say to Mum.

that she's pregnant?"

"Fuck that,
no way am I pregnant,"
