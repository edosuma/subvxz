00:01.000 --> 00:03.218
ANNOUNCER: Previously on
Pretty Little Liars...

00:03.270 --> 00:04.623
Mona placed some
kind of LoJack on her laptop

00:04.670 --> 00:06.194
before she died.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.629
Looks like it's a storage place
off of the turnpike.

00:08.670 --> 00:10.706
Talmadge recently hired
Jackie Molina

00:10.740 --> 00:11.559
as an admissions officer.

00:11.610 --> 00:13.134
ARIA: I regret
that I squandered

00:13.180 --> 00:14.636
my high school career
getting involved

00:14.680 --> 00:15.635
with an older guy.

00:15.680 --> 00:16.749
Tell me
you didn't send this.

00:16.780 --> 00:18.202
Jackie read it.

00:18.250 --> 00:19.376
What are you
gonna tell Ezra?

00:19.420 --> 00:21.274
ASHLEY: Jason and I,
it was nothing.

00:21.320 --> 00:22.480
You love Ted, right?

00:22.520 --> 00:24.181
Because he really loves you.

00:24.220 --> 00:25.312
Will you marry me?

00:25.350 --> 00:26.317
I need a minute.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.180
Is this you
outside of work?

00:28.220 --> 00:30.154
Casual looks good on you.

00:30.190 --> 00:31.384
TANNER:
Alison DiLaurentis,

00:31.430 --> 00:32.556
you are under arrest
for the murder

00:32.600 --> 00:34.295
of Mona Vanderwaal.

00:34.330 --> 00:35.490
Don't touch anything.

00:35.530 --> 00:37.395
Everything's bagged.
It looks like evidence.

00:37.430 --> 00:38.658
What did you and Caleb find?

00:38.700 --> 00:39.894
SPENCER: I can't tell you.

00:39.940 --> 00:42.158
CALEB: Hanna, that storage
unit is rented in your name.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.360
And I'm pretty sure that Mona's
body is hidden inside of it.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.348
You guys seriously think
Mona's body is in that barrel?

00:49.380 --> 00:50.802
Yes.

00:50.850 --> 00:54.149
We knew Alison was crazy,
but to do something like that?

00:54.180 --> 00:55.647
Makes her even
sicker than we thought.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.319
And now that psychopath
is targeting me.

01:01.860 --> 01:03.282
Hanna, this has to be payback

01:03.330 --> 01:04.479
from when you confronted
her in jail.

01:04.530 --> 01:06.418
Whoa, slow down.
When did you see Ali?

01:06.460 --> 01:07.688
And how does
Aria know about that,

01:07.730 --> 01:08.754
and we're just finding out?

01:09.770 --> 01:11.419
Guys, that has nothing
to do with this. Okay?

01:11.470 --> 01:13.335
That storage unit was rented
in Hanna's name

01:13.370 --> 01:14.689
4 months ago, okay.

01:14.740 --> 01:17.436
The day before
Mona was murdered.

01:17.470 --> 01:18.732
So it was Ali's plan
all along to frame you.

01:18.770 --> 01:20.738
Yeah. And that bloody
knife that Toby found

01:20.780 --> 01:22.407
I probably have
my prints all over it.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.179
I think it was a good choice
to get rid of it.

01:24.210 --> 01:25.302
Yeah.

01:25.350 --> 01:26.442
We should do the same thing
with the stuff in the bin.

01:26.480 --> 01:29.586
Hanna. Mona's body could
seriously be in that barrel.

01:29.620 --> 01:30.644
Do you want
to burn that, too?

01:30.690 --> 01:31.884
No. Of course not.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.353
But we can put it somewhere.

01:33.390 --> 01:34.482
If we touch anything,

01:34.520 --> 01:35.714
that's tampering
with the evidence.

01:35.760 --> 01:36.886
Evidence
that could convict Ali.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.886
And me. And I don't
have a good alibi.

01:38.930 --> 01:40.488
CALEB: Yes, you do.

01:40.530 --> 01:41.599
You were with me
at your house,

01:41.630 --> 01:42.597
prepping
the Thanksgiving turkey.

01:42.630 --> 01:44.166
Caleb, we were alone.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.792
The cops will just think
that you're protecting me.

01:45.830 --> 01:47.491
What about your mom?
Where was she?

01:47.540 --> 01:48.768
She was at the
soup kitchen with Ted.

01:51.310 --> 01:53.778
Well, we do have
one thing going for us.

01:53.810 --> 01:55.209
We're a step
ahead of Holbrook.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.673
He doesn't know
that we traced Mona's laptop

01:56.710 --> 01:58.200
back to the storage unit.

01:58.250 --> 02:00.138
How do we even know
that Holbrook's behind this?

02:00.180 --> 02:02.216
It could be any one
of Ali's little minions.

02:02.250 --> 02:03.319
Yesterday, we thought

02:04.650 --> 02:05.514
Yeah, but he wasn't.

02:05.550 --> 02:07.211
_ He sent me
on a Wild goose chase for...

02:08.860 --> 02:11.249
no reason.

02:11.290 --> 02:14.327
My point is, we have some time
to play a little offense.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.362
I will corrupt their data files
and make sure

02:16.400 --> 02:18.368
that Hanna's name is no longer
connected to that bin.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.662
SPENCER: Then we can tell
Tanner that we traced

02:19.700 --> 02:20.769
Mona's laptop there.

02:20.800 --> 02:21.869
ARIA: Yeah,
and she'll eventually

02:21.900 --> 02:23.663
put the pieces together
that Holbrook's behind this.

02:23.710 --> 02:24.768
Yeah, and if she doesn't?

02:24.810 --> 02:26.175
It will just boomerang
back onto me.

02:26.210 --> 02:27.199
EMILY: That's not gonna happen.

02:27.240 --> 02:28.332
How are you so sure?

02:28.380 --> 02:30.268
Hanna, this is the safest plan
we've got.

02:30.310 --> 02:31.868
Yes, safe for you guys.
Not for me.

02:33.450 --> 02:34.439
Hanna.

02:40.790 --> 02:43.327
* Got a secret,
can you keep it? *

02:43.360 --> 02:45.885
* Swear this one
you'll save *

02:45.930 --> 02:48.353
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

02:48.400 --> 02:50.925
* Taking this one
to the grave *

02:50.970 --> 02:52.892
* If I show you
then I know *

02:52.940 --> 02:55.966
* You won't tell what I said

02:56.000 --> 02:58.503
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

02:58.540 --> 03:01.179
* If one of them is dead

03:02.880 --> 03:04.347
Thinking about Mona
in that barrel

03:04.380 --> 03:05.506
gave me nightmares.

03:05.550 --> 03:07.415
I know. I barely slept.

03:07.450 --> 03:09.418
And when I did, I dreamt
that Holbrook wallpapered

03:09.450 --> 03:11.611
Ezra's entire apartment
with my letter to Jackie.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.785
I mean, I need to tell him
that I wrote it.

03:17.460 --> 03:18.427
Is he back there?

03:18.460 --> 03:19.358
No, not yet.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.594
He has meetings
with vendors all morning.

03:20.630 --> 03:23.963
Okay, I'm gonna call him.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.695
See ifI can catch him
between meetings.

03:39.480 --> 03:40.708
Did you make
that for Ezra?

03:40.750 --> 03:41.739
Yeah.

03:41.780 --> 03:43.486
I heard pecan's
his favorite.

03:46.320 --> 03:49.585
Look, um, Talia,
I'm getting the feeling

03:49.630 --> 03:51.985
that you think
he's available.

03:52.030 --> 03:53.452
But he's not.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.492
It's just a thank you
for hiring me.

03:56.530 --> 03:58.669
Not a marriage proposal.

03:58.700 --> 04:02.534
But I'm sorry
if I stepped on your turf.

04:02.570 --> 04:05.004
Oh, no.
No, I'm not interested in Ezra.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.871
Or any guys.

04:06.910 --> 04:09.378
So your ex is a girl?

04:09.410 --> 04:10.672
Yeah.

04:11.950 --> 04:14.748
By the way, he's dating
one of my good friends.

04:14.780 --> 04:16.338
So you might
want to back off.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.642
Good to know.

04:28.660 --> 04:29.627
Morning.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.297
Hi.

04:31.330 --> 04:32.888
I heard you
on the phone earlier.

04:32.940 --> 04:33.895
Was that Ted?

04:33.940 --> 04:35.362
Yeah.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.402
How'd it go?

04:40.880 --> 04:43.303
He was understanding.

04:43.350 --> 04:45.910
I explained to him after
you've failed at marriage once,

04:45.950 --> 04:48.316
it's not as easy
saying yes again.

04:49.950 --> 04:51.486
Did you tell him about Jason?

04:53.060 --> 04:54.084
No.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.520
And I've decided not to.

04:56.560 --> 04:59.620
Mom, last night you said
he deserves to know the truth.

04:59.660 --> 05:00.820
And I thought
about it some more.

05:00.860 --> 05:04.819
And I realized it would just
cause him unnecessary pain.

05:04.870 --> 05:06.019
Yeah, well,
it's gonna be worse

05:06.070 --> 05:07.628
if he ﬁnds out
from someone else.

05:07.670 --> 05:10.935
The only people who know
about it are you and Jason.

05:10.970 --> 05:13.404
And I trust that both
of you will keep it quiet.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.806
Ijust feel like
if you do marry Ted,

05:15.840 --> 05:17.478
I can see it
being the kind of thing

05:17.510 --> 05:19.068
that might gnaw at you
over the years.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.010
Enough, Hanna!

05:21.050 --> 05:23.018
If you really want to help,
forget it ever happened.

05:23.050 --> 05:24.847
Okay?

05:24.890 --> 05:26.585
That's what
I'm trying to do.

05:27.990 --> 05:29.457
I have errands to run.

05:29.490 --> 05:30.752
I'll see you at dinner.

05:30.790 --> 05:31.984
( cell phone rings )

05:54.680 --> 05:55.749
I need to speak to you.

05:55.780 --> 05:56.815
Spencen

05:56.850 --> 05:58.442
Can we please go
somewhere private?

05:58.490 --> 05:59.650
Are you okay?

05:59.690 --> 06:00.679
I'm fine.

06:00.720 --> 06:01.755
It's Hanna.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.855
Does this have to do
with what you and Caleb

06:06.900 --> 06:08.424
were texting about
last night?

06:08.460 --> 06:09.597
Yes.

06:09.630 --> 06:10.995
I thought we'd agreed
that you'd stop

06:11.030 --> 06:12.065
whatever it was
you were domg.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.692
It's not that simple, okay?

06:13.740 --> 06:16.504
You know that I wouldn't be
here if it wasn't important.

06:16.540 --> 06:18.462
I'm really afraid that Hanna's
gonna do something stupid.

06:18.510 --> 06:20.501
And I need your help.
Okay?

06:22.610 --> 06:24.009
Spencen
Hey.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.108
Shouldn't you be
at school?

06:25.150 --> 06:27.914
Uh, I was just
on my lunch break.

06:27.950 --> 06:32.011
But it's almost over,
so I should probably get going.

06:32.050 --> 06:33.051
Please call me soon.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.490
Oh, what's that?

06:39.530 --> 06:41.623
Alison DiLaurentis' case file.

06:41.660 --> 06:44.458
Oh, brushing up on the facts
before the trial starts?

06:44.500 --> 06:45.489
Yeah.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.998
But the facts
aren't so clear.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.804
They rarely are
in murder investigations.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.104
I think somebody
might have manipulated

06:53.140 --> 06:54.539
Alison's polygraph.

06:55.680 --> 06:56.749
Why would someone do that?

06:56.780 --> 06:58.702
To make it look like
she passed.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.913
Toby, for somebody
to change the results,

07:01.950 --> 07:03.042
they would have had
to have been there

07:03.090 --> 07:04.045
when she took the test.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.717
That's the only way

07:05.750 --> 07:07.559
they would know
what she missed.

07:07.590 --> 07:09.729
And the only people
there were Tom Higgins,

07:09.760 --> 07:13.548
who administered the polygraph,
two Rosewood cops and--

07:13.600 --> 07:14.953
Detective Holbrook.

07:17.570 --> 07:18.798
Careful.

07:18.830 --> 07:20.639
Don't make accusations
you can't back up.

07:20.670 --> 07:22.069
I'm not making accusations.

07:22.100 --> 07:24.466
I'm just saying
it's a possibility.

07:24.510 --> 07:27.673
Why would Holbrook
help Alison?

07:29.580 --> 07:31.707
People saw them kissing
at the Ice Ball dance.

07:31.750 --> 07:33.217
People?

07:33.250 --> 07:34.945
You mean your
high school girlfriend?

07:34.980 --> 07:36.641
I looked into Holbrook.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.112
He's not taking care
of his father.

07:38.150 --> 07:39.811
His father isn't even sick.

07:39.860 --> 07:43.125
You have been a cop
for all of 6 minutes,

07:43.160 --> 07:46.550
and you have the nerve
to investigate your superior?

07:46.600 --> 07:49.251
If you want
to keep your job,

07:49.300 --> 07:51.461
your little research project
ends here.

07:57.940 --> 07:59.737
I came as soon as I heard.
Is everything okay?

08:01.240 --> 08:03.105
Yeah, everything's fine.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.708
I just wanted to...

08:06.850 --> 08:09.273
I just wanted to tell you
that I got into Talmadge.

08:09.320 --> 08:11.481
That's fantastic news.

08:14.220 --> 08:17.849
I guess Jackie doesn't review
every single application.

08:20.160 --> 08:23.288
Aria, Talmadge is
a very good school,

08:23.330 --> 08:24.888
and it's a big one.

08:24.930 --> 08:26.693
It's unlikely
you would ever run into Jackie.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.189
Don't let her ruin this
for you.

08:29.240 --> 08:30.901
No, she won't.

08:32.170 --> 08:34.070
Look, I'm so happy
you told me.

08:34.110 --> 08:36.647
And I'm sorry, but I have
to get back to work.

08:36.680 --> 08:38.875
But, um, we can
celebrate tonight.

08:38.910 --> 08:39.945
Okay?

08:39.980 --> 08:41.242
Okay.
Okay, great.

08:45.990 --> 08:47.287
Ezra.
Yeah.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.754
Um, that's not
the only thing

08:49.790 --> 08:50.984
that I wanted to talk
to you about.

08:53.230 --> 08:56.028
Jackie did review
my application.

08:57.630 --> 08:58.665
How do you know that?

09:00.240 --> 09:02.299
Well, I wrote a letter
to the admission's board

09:02.340 --> 09:05.229
hoping that it would land
on her desk.

09:05.270 --> 09:07.807
And it did.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.649
What letter?

09:18.820 --> 09:21.789
*_-

09:23.360 --> 09:27.023
*_-

09:32.100 --> 09:33.692
( knocking on door)

09:38.040 --> 09:39.064
Hey.

09:39.110 --> 09:40.134
Hey.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.238
Mission accomplished.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.941
You erased the files?

09:42.980 --> 09:45.801
Not erased, but corrupted.

09:45.850 --> 09:47.010
Do you want me
to tell the girls?

09:47.050 --> 09:48.847
Not yet.

09:55.020 --> 09:56.681
What is all this?

10:03.830 --> 10:06.799
Hanna, you can't move
everything on your own.

10:06.840 --> 10:07.966
You will get caught.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.662
I know.
That's why you're gonna help me.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.268
No, I'm not.

10:12.310 --> 10:13.971
We agreed we weren't
gonna touch anything.

10:14.010 --> 10:15.739
No, you guys agreed.

10:15.780 --> 10:16.974
And since I could spend
the rest of my life

10:17.010 --> 10:19.046
in an orange jumpsuit,
I think that I have

10:19.080 --> 10:20.149
the final say here.

10:21.850 --> 10:22.817
We're never gonna
pull this off.

10:22.850 --> 10:23.885
Yes, we will.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.388
Look, I found a drill bit
that can break that lock.

10:26.420 --> 10:28.809
And I already
rented a van and a dolly.

10:30.690 --> 10:32.226
What are you gonna do
with everything inside the bin?

10:32.260 --> 10:33.955
We'll burn the clothes
and personal Items.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.126
And the barrel?

10:35.160 --> 10:36.229
We'll roll it into
the woods somewhere,

10:36.260 --> 10:38.069
and then we'll call the police
with a burner phone.

10:38.100 --> 10:39.226
No. They'll trace
your tire tracks.

10:39.270 --> 10:41.135
I won't drive
on any dirt roads.

10:41.170 --> 10:43.138
Hanna, you're not
a forensic expert. Okay?

10:43.170 --> 10:45.229
You cannot possibly know
everything that you need

10:45.270 --> 10:46.874
to do to avoid
leaVIng a trace.

10:46.910 --> 10:49.299
Look, Alison has gone
through a lot of trouble

10:49.340 --> 10:50.238
to pin this on me.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.271
For all I know she could
have stuck a wad

10:52.310 --> 10:54.141
of my gum on
one of Mona's shoes.

10:54.180 --> 10:57.217
My DNA could be
anywhere in there.

10:57.250 --> 11:00.788
I have no choice
but to do this.

11:00.820 --> 11:01.980
Just like you didn't
when you found that knife.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.798
This has to work.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.028
You forgot one thing.

11:12.070 --> 11:13.389
What's that?

11:13.440 --> 11:15.067
The cameras.

11:23.180 --> 11:24.442
No wonder you got in.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.970
I don't blame
you for being furious.

11:26.010 --> 11:27.773
It was
a really stupid thing to do.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.378
And I realized
that after I did it.

11:29.420 --> 11:30.944
I mean,
I tried to get the letter back

11:30.990 --> 11:32.139
from Jackie,
but she'd already read it.

11:32.190 --> 11:33.282
It was too late. I--

11:33.320 --> 11:36.016
Aria, stop.
I'm not angry.

11:36.060 --> 11:37.459
You're not?

11:37.490 --> 11:41.096
It's a brilliant move.
Jackie must have lapped it up.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.098
Oh, yeah, she definitely did.

11:48.240 --> 11:51.061
Ezra, I'm-- I'm sorry.
Really.

11:51.110 --> 11:53.305
You did what you had
to do to get in.

11:53.340 --> 11:54.375
There was no harm done.

11:54.410 --> 11:55.672
Yes, there was.

11:55.710 --> 11:57.905
I actually made Jackie believe
that I feel this way about you.

11:57.950 --> 11:59.474
Well, I don't care
what Jackie thinks.

11:59.510 --> 12:02.308
Only what you do.
And that is all that matters.

12:07.460 --> 12:08.950
Yeah,
but I didn't have to do it.

12:08.990 --> 12:10.787
Write that letter.

12:10.830 --> 12:13.196
And I don't even
want to go to Talmadge.

12:13.230 --> 12:14.857
I was just scared
that if I didn't get in,

12:14.900 --> 12:15.958
I'd be stuck here.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.468
Well, now you don't have
to worry.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.943
I reviewed the tenant contracts,
made some notes.

12:31.980 --> 12:34.119
And I organized
the contractor bills.

12:34.150 --> 12:35.469
They tend
to overcharge for labor,

12:35.520 --> 12:37.010
so you got to watch out
for that.

12:40.990 --> 12:42.014
You don't have to do this.

12:42.060 --> 12:44.028
Do what?

12:44.060 --> 12:45.755
Quit because of
what happened the other night.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.254
Yes, I do.

12:49.300 --> 12:54.533
Look, I admit
it was unexpected.

12:54.570 --> 12:56.868
But I think unexpected
is a good thing

12:56.910 --> 12:58.207
in my life right now.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.538
Jason, I'm seeing someone.

13:02.610 --> 13:04.805
And it's serious.

13:07.050 --> 13:08.074
How serious?

13:08.120 --> 13:11.009
Serious enough that
he proposed to me last night.

13:11.050 --> 13:13.211
That is serious.

13:15.890 --> 13:17.118
He was gone
for 3 months.

13:17.160 --> 13:21.290
And our relationship had been
a lot of phone calls and emails.

13:23.970 --> 13:24.994
And I was lonely.

13:28.070 --> 13:29.059
I know what that's like.

13:31.640 --> 13:34.529
It wouldn't be right for me
to keep working for you.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.571
I wasn't gonna stay past
the end of the month anyway.

13:36.610 --> 13:38.475
Yeah.

13:39.650 --> 13:40.674
Yeah, I get it.

13:40.720 --> 13:45.419
Feel free to swing by
the office this afternoon

13:45.450 --> 13:47.111
to pick up
the rest of your stuff.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.048
I'll be out most of the day.

13:49.090 --> 13:50.557
Thank you.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.491
Wait, you don't think
anyone will check the cameras?

14:02.100 --> 14:04.068
Nobody was watching the monitors
when we walked by the office.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.099
And if they do?

14:05.140 --> 14:06.368
We'll deal with it then.
Okay?

14:06.410 --> 14:08.207
It's better to take
that chance than to have

14:08.240 --> 14:09.400
any of this recorded.

14:11.980 --> 14:14.244
All right,
let's get the dolly.

14:16.250 --> 14:17.217
Where you going?

14:17.250 --> 14:18.911
I want to see
what we're dealing with first.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.497
I can't believe you told Ezra
and lived to talk about it.

14:32.530 --> 14:33.531
I know.

14:33.570 --> 14:35.959
I mean, I wasted so much
energy worrying about

14:36.000 --> 14:37.308
how he was gonna react
when I could have been

14:37.340 --> 14:38.307
worrying about
all the other things

14:38.340 --> 14:39.932
that I have to worry about.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.129
Like Hanna.

14:41.180 --> 14:42.670
She isn't taking mine
or Spencer's calls.

14:42.710 --> 14:43.642
Have you talked to her?

14:43.680 --> 14:44.442
No.
I haven't.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.368
But hopefully,
I can lure her out

14:46.410 --> 14:47.877
of the house
with a hot fudge brownie.

14:49.350 --> 14:50.681
Uh, I don't think

14:50.720 --> 14:53.689
that's an actual parking spot,
Spence.

14:53.720 --> 14:54.687
The laptop's moving.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.256
What?

14:56.290 --> 14:57.222
Mona's laptop.

14:57.260 --> 14:58.659
Somebody's taken it
out of the storage unit.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.248
Holbrook?
My money's on Hanna.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.551
She wasn't
in school today.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.999
Okay, Hanna
might be scared,

15:03.030 --> 15:04.258
but she wouldn't
do something like that.

15:04.300 --> 15:05.892
Are you sure?

15:07.170 --> 15:08.660
There's only one way
to find out.

15:12.110 --> 15:13.099
Come on.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.411
Oh, sorry.

15:28.460 --> 15:29.552
I thought you'd be
gone by now.

15:29.590 --> 15:32.286
I had some things to do
before I could get over here.

15:32.330 --> 15:35.151
I'll go.
Let you finish up.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.599
That's right.
I'm almost done.

15:49.010 --> 15:50.341
An engagement
but no ring?

15:53.080 --> 15:54.217
Yeah.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.945
I haven't given him
an answer yet.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.084
He's a pastor.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.452
And there are _
certain responSIbIIItIes

16:02.490 --> 16:03.718
that go along
with marrying him.

16:03.760 --> 16:06.081
I'm not sure I'm cut out
for that life.

16:07.630 --> 16:09.996
Yeah. I bet those church
socials can be pretty brutal.

16:11.500 --> 16:12.296
I wish it was that simple.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.103
I haven't always
made the best choices.

16:19.510 --> 16:22.502
I just wouldn't want anything
I've done to hurt him...

16:24.480 --> 16:25.504
or all that he's worked for.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.616
Can I ask you something?

16:35.660 --> 16:38.322
Sure.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.759
Did Saturday night happen

16:39.790 --> 16:43.328
so that you'd have
an excuse to say no?

16:43.370 --> 16:47.636
Because I've done
stuff like that before.

16:47.670 --> 16:49.490
Screwed up a good thing
because I was afraid

16:49.540 --> 16:51.804
my past was gonna
get in the way.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.400
That's not what it was, Jason.

16:54.440 --> 16:59.275
Maybe not,
but I wouldn't be offended

16:59.310 --> 17:00.345
if it had been.

17:00.380 --> 17:03.281
It wasn't.
Really.

17:11.830 --> 17:18.793
* Bones shake,
it's lonely, it's late *

17:18.830 --> 17:25.633
* Footsteps echo,
glimmers of hate *

17:25.670 --> 17:28.309
* There's a sadness

17:30.450 --> 17:35.171
_ * Hard times
just won't let me go *

17:36.420 --> 17:37.580
Take this left.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.454
How much further?

17:43.260 --> 17:44.818
The GPS says that
we're about a mile away.

17:46.130 --> 17:47.552
Why would Caleb
help Hanna do this?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.295
We don't know
that he is.

17:49.330 --> 17:51.161
They're not at Hanna's house,
they're not calling us back.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.462
He's got to be
helping her.

17:55.870 --> 17:58.065
It's up ahead on the right.

17:59.210 --> 18:00.234
Hurry up.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.838
I'm going
as fast as I can.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.102
So much for being
a step ahead of Holbrook.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.613
Why would
he leave the barrel?

18:45.920 --> 18:47.012
I don't know.

18:47.050 --> 18:48.517
Maybe he thought it was
too heaw to carry it himself.

18:51.590 --> 18:52.818
We need to open it.

18:52.860 --> 18:54.350
No, I can't look.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.222
Look, Mona's body
might actually be in there.

18:58.270 --> 18:59.567
It's bad enough
that she's gone,

18:59.600 --> 19:01.363
but if she went
like this...

19:08.840 --> 19:10.137
Okay.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.319
But if Mona's body is in there,
we have to get it out of here.

19:19.390 --> 19:20.687
Let's get the dolly.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.465
EMILY: What is this place?

19:37.310 --> 19:39.437
SPENCER: Looks like it's an
old ice cream factory.

19:49.550 --> 19:52.417
Why would Hanna and Caleb
come all the way out here?

19:52.450 --> 19:54.384
Because they knew
no one else would.

19:58.360 --> 19:59.520
( metal door closing )

20:09.570 --> 20:10.935
Hanna?

20:10.970 --> 20:12.369
Caleb?

20:23.020 --> 20:25.215
That's got to be
the wind moving stuff around.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.851
Where does the tracker
say the laptop Is?

20:29.890 --> 20:30.959
( tracker beeps )

20:32.490 --> 20:33.923
I completely lost service.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.848
Right, well,
this place is huge.

20:35.900 --> 20:37.492
We should probably
split up.

20:37.530 --> 20:39.725
Yeah, I'll go check out
the second floor.

20:39.770 --> 20:41.237
Okay.

20:46.340 --> 20:47.477
Which way is the exit?

20:48.810 --> 20:50.505
I think
it's around that corner.

21:02.660 --> 21:05.686
So you're here
to rent a storage unit?

21:05.730 --> 21:06.879
Yeah, just wanted
to see what sizes

21:06.930 --> 21:07.954
they have available.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.423
TANNER: You're a little young
to have accumulated

21:10.470 --> 21:11.892
so much stuff.

21:11.930 --> 21:13.466
Well, I just moved
back to town.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.593
And the place that I'm staying
at doesn't really

21:15.640 --> 21:17.699
have enough room
for all my things, so...

21:17.740 --> 21:19.662
I see.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.708
Did you know your friend was
looking to rent a unit here?

21:24.750 --> 21:27.002
No, I didn't.

21:32.690 --> 21:34.612
Nervous about something?

21:34.660 --> 21:35.558
Yeah.

21:35.590 --> 21:36.909
IfI can make it
to the bathroom in time.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.052
I really have to pee.

21:38.090 --> 21:40.650
Oh, well, then
you better get going.

21:55.580 --> 21:56.831
Do we need to wait
for the manager

21:56.880 --> 21:58.541
to show him
the search warrant?

21:58.580 --> 22:00.719
He's on his way over now.

22:06.490 --> 22:08.310
Looks like
someone's camera shy.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.414
( muffled voices )

22:48.500 --> 22:49.592
( rustling )

23:08.980 --> 23:10.049
( gasps )

23:28.070 --> 23:29.594
We're not gonna need that.

23:49.660 --> 23:51.127
( muffled voices )

23:56.760 --> 23:57.897
CALEB: ( on computer)
What are you gonna do

23:57.930 --> 23:59.158
with all the stuff in the bin?

23:59.200 --> 24:00.189
HANNA: ( on computer )
We'll burn the clothes

24:00.230 --> 24:01.197
and personal items.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.639
And the barrel?

24:02.670 --> 24:03.807
We'll roll it
into the woods,

24:03.840 --> 24:04.966
and then we'll call the police
with a burner phone.

24:05.010 --> 24:06.466
We'll never pull this off.

24:06.510 --> 24:07.738
Yes, we will.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.873
I found a drill bit
that can break the lock.

24:09.910 --> 24:12.572
And I already
rented a van and a dolly.

24:14.580 --> 24:16.719
What are you gonna do
with all the stuff in the bin?

24:16.750 --> 24:18.638
We'll burn the clothes
and personal Items.

24:18.690 --> 24:19.941
And the barrel?

24:19.990 --> 24:22.652
We'll roll it
into the woods,

24:22.690 --> 24:24.157
and then we'll call the police
with a burner phone.

24:26.230 --> 24:27.219
We'll never pull this off.

24:27.260 --> 24:28.898
Yes, we will.

24:28.930 --> 24:30.966
I found a drill bit
that can break the lock.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.163
And I already
rented a van and a dolly.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.667
What are you gonna do
with all the stuff in the bin?

24:35.700 --> 24:37.509
We'll burn the clothes
and personal Items.

24:37.540 --> 24:38.734
And the barrel?

24:38.770 --> 24:39.759
We'll roll it
into the woods...

24:39.810 --> 24:41.573
Hey, sorry.

24:41.610 --> 24:42.872
Come, look at this.

24:42.910 --> 24:43.877
We'll never
pull thIs off.

24:43.910 --> 24:45.104
Yes, we will.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.879
I found a drill bit
that can break the lock.

24:46.910 --> 24:50.539
And I already rented
a van and a dolly.

24:50.590 --> 24:51.818
What are you gonna do
with all the stuff in the bin?

24:51.850 --> 24:52.987
Somebody knows
we're here.

24:53.020 --> 24:54.715
It's not Hanna and Caleb.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.113
Let's go find Emily.
Come on.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.559
And then
we'll call the police...

24:57.590 --> 24:58.887
( clattering )

24:58.930 --> 25:00.181
Whoa, whoa.

25:17.240 --> 25:18.571
No!

25:18.610 --> 25:20.077
( screaming )

25:22.750 --> 25:24.286
( motor buzzing )

25:24.320 --> 25:25.582
Wait, what's happening?

25:25.620 --> 25:27.144
I thought this place
was shut down.

25:27.190 --> 25:28.657
( alarm rings )

25:33.600 --> 25:34.794
Hey!

25:39.030 --> 25:40.019
Emily!

25:40.070 --> 25:41.537
Oh, my God,
this is really cold.

25:42.770 --> 25:44.635
That's liquid nitrogen.

25:44.670 --> 25:45.807
What does that mean?

25:45.840 --> 25:46.864
It means that the
temperature's gonna

25:46.910 --> 25:47.831
drop below zero.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.029
And if we don't get out
of here really soon,

25:49.080 --> 25:51.071
we're gonna freeze to death.

25:51.110 --> 25:52.304
( both gasping )

25:52.350 --> 25:53.908
Oh, my God.

25:53.950 --> 25:55.941
Oh, my God,
it's very cold.

25:55.980 --> 25:57.948
Oh, my God.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.082
Oh, my God.

26:00.790 --> 26:01.757
What are we gonna do?

26:01.790 --> 26:03.212
What do we do?

26:03.260 --> 26:04.750
( banging )

26:04.790 --> 26:06.018
Emily!

26:06.060 --> 26:07.652
Oh, my God.

26:10.800 --> 26:11.767
( screaming )

26:11.800 --> 26:12.767
It won't budge!

26:12.800 --> 26:14.131
Emily!

26:14.170 --> 26:15.194
Help me please!

26:17.870 --> 26:18.939
( both panting and gasping )

26:34.860 --> 26:35.986
Emily!

26:40.430 --> 26:42.022
Oh, God.

26:48.270 --> 26:49.794
Okay, hang on.

26:52.170 --> 26:53.159
( both whimpering )

26:53.210 --> 26:54.802
Oh, my God.

27:09.860 --> 27:10.849
Hang on.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.118
Okay.

27:12.160 --> 27:13.252
Are you guys okay?

27:13.290 --> 27:14.826
Oh, my God.

27:14.860 --> 27:16.828
Here.

27:16.860 --> 27:18.020
Oh, my God.

27:40.290 --> 27:41.951
What's that smell?

27:41.990 --> 27:43.059
I'm not sure.

27:44.790 --> 27:46.018
Go call the station
and tell them

27:46.060 --> 27:47.652
that we need a HazMat team.

28:28.370 --> 28:29.894
Thanks for helping me
with the boxes.

28:31.970 --> 28:33.062
What's this?

28:33.110 --> 28:34.930
It's a list of headhunters
In the area.

28:34.980 --> 28:37.130
_It shouldn't be too hard
to ﬁnd someone to replace me.

28:37.180 --> 28:38.408
Thank you.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.816
And I'm sorry about
what I said earlier.

28:40.850 --> 28:42.078
I hope
I didn't cross a line.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.781
You didn't.

28:43.820 --> 28:46.209
Honestly, there's probably
some truth to it.

28:48.390 --> 28:50.255
So do you think
you'll stick with the business?

28:51.890 --> 28:53.949
Well, it's not gonna be easy
working with my father.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.319
We're not talking
much right now.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.363
And when we do,
usually it just consists of him

28:58.400 --> 29:01.494
reminding me of all the ways
that I've disappointed him.

29:01.540 --> 29:04.429
Maybe you shouldn't
work with him.

29:06.010 --> 29:07.978
_ You can't move forward
If you're stuck In the past.

29:08.010 --> 29:10.399
Good advice.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.916
I hope
it works out for you.

29:14.950 --> 29:17.145
You, too.

29:26.060 --> 29:27.049
Jason.

29:28.460 --> 29:30.257
I'm sorry.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.461
This can't happen again.

29:50.450 --> 29:52.111
Hanna, it's me, again.

29:52.150 --> 29:53.856
Where are you?

29:53.890 --> 29:55.380
Call me as soon
as you get thIs.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.948
Oh, hi.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.161
I didn't think anyone else
was back here.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.326
Just me and my apples.

30:10.340 --> 30:11.432
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

30:11.470 --> 30:12.903
Ezra just asked me
to close up.

30:12.940 --> 30:13.929
So...

30:13.980 --> 30:15.299
I'll just wait outside.

30:15.340 --> 30:16.329
You want to take over?

30:16.380 --> 30:18.575
And I'll finish cleaning up.

30:18.610 --> 30:21.170
We both know
I'm not much of a cook.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.814
Oh, come on,
you'll be doing me a favor.

30:30.990 --> 30:33.481
Okay.

30:33.530 --> 30:36.090
So grab and stir.

30:37.930 --> 30:39.989
Yeah, that's all
there's to it.

30:41.900 --> 30:43.128
You have something
in your hair.

30:43.170 --> 30:44.467
What?

30:45.640 --> 30:47.107
What were you doing?

30:47.140 --> 30:48.368
Running through the woods?

30:48.410 --> 30:50.230
Oh, Ijust...

30:50.280 --> 30:51.372
I've no idea
how that got in there.

30:52.910 --> 30:54.969
All right, well, I'm gonna
put some things away.

30:57.220 --> 30:58.517
( cell phone beeps )

31:05.130 --> 31:06.449
Oh, my God!

31:10.970 --> 31:12.494
Hey, don't worry.

31:12.530 --> 31:13.622
It happens sometimes.

31:13.670 --> 31:14.932
I'm so sorry. I--

31:14.970 --> 31:17.495
No, it's nothing, trust me.

31:17.540 --> 31:18.939
The last place I worked at,

31:18.970 --> 31:20.369
I almost burned
the whole kitchen down.

31:21.540 --> 31:23.098
On second thought,
why don't you go

31:23.140 --> 31:24.175
read out in the front.

31:24.210 --> 31:25.575
And I'll finish up here.
Okay.

31:33.620 --> 31:35.656
You didn't eat that much.

31:35.690 --> 31:36.884
Yeah, I'm not that hungry.

31:44.700 --> 31:45.724
What is this?

31:45.770 --> 31:48.637
Something to celebrate
your getting into Talmadge.

31:59.380 --> 32:02.417
It's-- It's beautiful.
Thank you so much.

32:02.450 --> 32:05.510
I remember how excited I was
when I got accepted to Hol|Is.

32:05.550 --> 32:09.156
There are so many amazing
adventures ahead of you.

32:09.190 --> 32:14.127
And I don't want you to
miss out on a single one,

32:14.160 --> 32:15.024
the way that you missed out

32:15.060 --> 32:17.153
on so much of high school
because of me.

32:19.070 --> 32:22.164
Ezra, I don't actually feel
that way.

32:22.200 --> 32:23.428
I read the letter again.

32:23.470 --> 32:24.334
Yeah, but you know I only wrote

32:24.370 --> 32:26.133
what I thought Jackie
wanted to hear.

32:26.170 --> 32:28.331
I think it rang
true to her for a reason.

32:28.380 --> 32:29.631
Yeah.
Because I'm a good writer.

32:33.450 --> 32:34.348
I don't understand.

32:34.380 --> 32:36.041
This morning you were
practically laughing

32:36.080 --> 32:36.910
when you read it.

32:36.950 --> 32:38.645
Then I had a chance
to think about it.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.681
And I don't think
you could've written

32:40.720 --> 32:42.688
what you did if there wasn't
some small part of you

32:42.720 --> 32:44.119
that thought
that way about us.

32:44.160 --> 32:47.027
I don't regret being
with you, Ezra, at all.

32:47.060 --> 32:48.596
Maybe not now,
but if we stay together--

32:48.630 --> 32:49.619
If?

32:51.770 --> 32:54.330
What are you--
What are you saying?

32:54.370 --> 32:56.190
I'm saying I want
what's best for you.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.434
You're approaching

32:57.470 --> 32:59.461
a very exciting time
in your life.

32:59.510 --> 33:00.659
You're going to be
meeting new people.

33:00.710 --> 33:02.439
You're going to be
discovering yourself.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.301
Right. I can do all of that
and still be with you.

33:13.490 --> 33:17.551
If we stay together,
you might grow to resent me.

33:19.460 --> 33:22.224
But if you take this time
for yourself...

33:24.400 --> 33:25.526
there will be no regrets.

33:32.340 --> 33:34.001
Promise me you'll at least
think about it.

33:40.550 --> 33:41.710
Yeah, I will.

33:43.820 --> 33:45.617
How could you tell Toby
about the storage unit?

33:45.650 --> 33:46.639
I didn't.
Well,
I don't believe you.

33:46.690 --> 33:49.352
I wanted to tell him. Okay?
I almost told him.

33:49.390 --> 33:50.379
But I didn't.

33:50.420 --> 33:51.387
Well, then how come
he and Tanner

33:51.430 --> 33:52.385
showed up there today?

33:52.430 --> 33:53.488
_ Because Holbrook
broke Into your computer, Hanna.

33:53.530 --> 33:56.351
He recorded the conversation
that you and Caleb had.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.391
He knew that you were
going to the storage unit.

33:58.430 --> 33:59.658
And he probably
just tipped them off.

33:59.700 --> 34:01.531
Why wouldn't he just
leave everything in there

34:01.570 --> 34:03.128
if he and Ali
want to pin this on me?

34:03.170 --> 34:04.137
I don't know.

34:04.170 --> 34:05.239
And why didn't
Toby warn us?

34:05.270 --> 34:06.407
I don't know.

34:06.440 --> 34:08.135
Toby knew about
the knife, Spencer.

34:08.180 --> 34:09.807
Okay? He knew one of us
was being set up.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.307
Well, he didn't
see it that way.

34:13.780 --> 34:15.316
Since when did his job
become more important

34:15.350 --> 34:16.510
than his friends?

34:16.550 --> 34:19.383
You know, you can't
blame this on Toby.

34:19.420 --> 34:20.546
We told you not to
move that stuff.

34:20.590 --> 34:22.410
You didn't listen to us.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.382
You screwed yourself
by going in there.

34:24.430 --> 34:26.227
And you screwed
over Caleb, too.

34:26.260 --> 34:29.388
Wow. Nice.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.429
( phone buzzes )

34:49.720 --> 34:51.847
We need to talk about
what happened tonight.

34:51.890 --> 34:53.687
Okay.

34:53.720 --> 34:56.382
We know
one or more people helped

34:56.420 --> 34:58.581
Alison kill Mona
and move her body.

35:00.530 --> 35:04.125
I don't know if what we found
are Mona's remaIns.

35:04.170 --> 35:08.368
But I do know if those
drops of blood match her DNA,

35:08.400 --> 35:09.867
your friends will be
the first people

35:09.900 --> 35:11.504
I bring in for questioning.

35:13.570 --> 35:16.607
Let me remind you,
you took an oath

35:16.640 --> 35:18.244
when you became
a police officer.

35:19.480 --> 35:23.348
Withholding information
is not an option.

35:23.380 --> 35:30.354
So if there is
anything that I should know,

35:30.390 --> 35:32.529
now is the time to tell me.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.230
I'm not even sure
that this is Holbrook anymore.

35:41.270 --> 35:43.898
I mean, why would he be
willing to kill for Alison?

35:43.940 --> 35:45.703
Spencer and Aria almost froze
to death tonight.

35:45.740 --> 35:50.837
And I-- Hanna, I got to go.
I'll call you when I get home.

35:52.410 --> 35:55.243
I'm almost done. I just need
to wipe down the counters.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.269
Okay.

35:57.750 --> 36:00.412
And about your dish--

36:00.450 --> 36:01.781
You didn't ruin it, Emily.

36:01.820 --> 36:05.426
My apple pie
is now apple flambe.

36:07.760 --> 36:12.561
I'm sorry, I'm just--
I'm not really myself today.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.433
Do you want
to talk about it?

36:17.570 --> 36:19.538
Um, not really.

36:19.570 --> 36:24.598
I just need some sleep. Rest.
You know, recharge.

36:24.650 --> 36:25.776
Have you eaten?

36:25.810 --> 36:27.903
Not much.

36:27.950 --> 36:29.918
Well, you can't recharge
on an empty stomach.

36:31.750 --> 36:32.682
You made that for me?

36:32.720 --> 36:35.689
Mashed potatoes
always make me feel better,

36:35.720 --> 36:38.928
so maybe they'll do
the same for you.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.621
Thank you.

36:43.960 --> 36:46.463
I can't imagine
what you must think of me.

36:50.470 --> 36:53.701
Ever since you got here
I've been a mess.

36:53.740 --> 36:54.934
You know,
first I tried to kick you

36:54.980 --> 36:57.574
out of the kitchen,
then I broke down

36:57.610 --> 37:00.773
about my ex, and now this.

37:00.810 --> 37:04.439
You know, I wouldn't say
I'm the smoothest person,

37:04.490 --> 37:07.846
but generally
I'm a little less--

37:07.890 --> 37:09.482
Neurotic?

37:12.960 --> 37:15.326
That's probably better than
coming across like

37:15.360 --> 37:19.592
a total control freak,
which is how I imagine

37:19.630 --> 37:20.597
you probably see me.

37:20.630 --> 37:21.938
No.

37:24.370 --> 37:29.831
So the other day when I made
that comment about

37:29.880 --> 37:31.279
Ezra being cute...

37:31.310 --> 37:33.608
Yeah.

37:33.650 --> 37:37.848
I didn't say it because
I was interested in him.

37:39.720 --> 37:43.611
I said it because
I'm interested in you.

37:43.660 --> 37:46.629
I was trying to figure out
if you were

37:46.660 --> 37:50.494
into guys or girls
by your reaction.

37:52.530 --> 37:55.636
I should go finish cleaning up
the kitchen.

38:01.810 --> 38:03.801
Holbrook recorded
our conversatIon, Caleb.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.774
He knew that we're going
to the storage unit.

38:05.810 --> 38:06.777
He set us up.

38:06.810 --> 38:10.018
He probably already sent
that video to Tanner.

38:10.050 --> 38:12.348
No, if he did,
we wouldn't be standing here.

38:12.390 --> 38:13.641
Well, then it's only
a matter of time

38:13.690 --> 38:14.657
before he does.

38:14.690 --> 38:16.908
Okay, then we'll deal with that
if it happens.

38:16.960 --> 38:20.020
Oh, God, you told me
not to touch that stuff

38:20.060 --> 38:21.027
and I didn't listen.

38:21.060 --> 38:23.051
I pulled you
into this mess.

38:23.100 --> 38:24.920
I'm not gonna drag you
down any further.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.824
Meaning?

38:28.130 --> 38:29.836
If Holbrook shows
Tanner the video,

38:29.870 --> 38:33.533
I'll just say that I forced you
to go with me.

38:33.570 --> 38:36.471
And that you lied for me.
And that it was my idea.

38:36.510 --> 38:38.034
She's not gonna see
it like that.

38:40.050 --> 38:42.541
Well, then you should
stay away from me for a while.

38:42.580 --> 38:44.548
That's not gonna happen.

38:44.590 --> 38:46.512
Caleb, don't you get it?

38:46.550 --> 38:48.017
I'm dangerous to be
around right now.

38:48.050 --> 38:50.553
If this little plan of Ali's
doesn't work out,

38:50.590 --> 38:52.979
then she's gonna
think of something else.

38:53.030 --> 38:54.452
She's not gonna give up.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.320
Then we'll both be
behind bars.

38:57.860 --> 38:59.396
Maybe not at the
same facility.

38:59.430 --> 39:00.988
I'm serious, Caleb.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.460
Me too.

39:07.040 --> 39:11.101
* Love

39:11.140 --> 39:18.046
* Is the air that feels me

39:18.080 --> 39:22.710
* Is the hope

39:22.760 --> 39:27.754
* That this morning may see

39:30.900 --> 39:37.829
* Believe me.
There's no reason to stay *

39:42.080 --> 39:49.043
* I will follow.

39:54.020 --> 39:57.581
* And we search for
the reasons *

39:57.620 --> 40:00.885
* And pray for the gods

40:00.930 --> 40:06.891
* Day by day

40:06.930 --> 40:12.562
* Building our bridges
on common ground *

40:12.610 --> 40:19.573
* We hope for
what's never been there *

40:28.490 --> 40:30.082
( cell phone rings )

40:33.690 --> 40:36.193
Where have you been?
I've been calling you for hours.

40:36.230 --> 40:37.197
TOBY: I'm still at work.

40:37.230 --> 40:39.528
I'm buried in paperwork.

40:39.570 --> 40:42.494
What were you doing
at that storage unit?

40:42.540 --> 40:45.134
Tanner got an anonymous call
that Mona's body was in there.

40:45.170 --> 40:46.967
Okay, well, why didn't you
call and tell me?

40:47.010 --> 40:48.932
You knew that I was
worried about Hanna.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.174
I found out
on the drive over.

40:50.210 --> 40:53.668
I couldn't exactly call you
with Tanner sitting next to me.

40:53.710 --> 40:56.508
What was in the barrel?

40:58.690 --> 40:59.816
Toby?

41:00.850 --> 41:02.112
I can't talk about it.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.252
What do you mean,
you can't talk about it?

41:03.290 --> 41:05.952
Hanna and Caleb need to know
if Mona's body was in there.

41:05.990 --> 41:08.026
I got to go.
Tanner's calling me.

41:08.060 --> 41:10.221
Okay, well, just come over
after work then.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.660
I'll be here late.

41:12.700 --> 41:13.962
I don't really care
what time you get off.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.797
I really need to see you.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.968
I can't, Spencer, okay.
I'll call you tomorrow.

41:19.010 --> 41:19.999
Wait--

42:11.690 --> 42:13.180
( door closing )
