00:35.827 --> 00:36.828
Hi.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.456
Hi.

01:54.698 --> 01:57.159
Please tell me my keys are here.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.328
In the fishbowl.

02:10.214 --> 02:11.882
I don't see them…

02:11.965 --> 02:14.801
They are there. I took them.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.889
Here they are.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.725
But not all of them.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.977
I don't know. That's what you had.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.760
-Freddie.
-I'm not pausing.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.972
Open the door.

04:08.624 --> 04:12.711
You can only eat this junk on weekends.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.588
-It's all we have.
-It's not.

04:16.632 --> 04:17.798
Come on. Get going.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.718
-To go to school?
-You have to go to school?

04:19.801 --> 04:22.221
Yeah, you have to go to school.
I go to work. You go to school.

04:22.304 --> 04:23.472
That's the deal.

04:23.555 --> 04:24.848
You weren't working though.

04:27.226 --> 04:28.560
I was at the office.

04:28.644 --> 04:30.354
-I called you from there.
-No, you didn't.

04:32.648 --> 04:33.690
Okay.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.568
Okay, Freddie, maybe I didn't.
I don't know.

04:36.652 --> 04:38.946
But you still have to go to school.
Please.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.241
Let's go to school.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.118
I'll drop you off.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.620
Hey.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.251
You leave this in the car?

04:52.334 --> 04:53.544
That's not mine.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.391
Yeah, okay. I heard you.

05:55.731 --> 05:56.940
Wait. We have to make lunch.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.822
I'll fix something for you.
What do you want?

07:19.231 --> 07:21.525
Any chance you've pulled
the statehouse interviews?

07:22.317 --> 07:24.528
Regional asked us
to put a hold on those

07:24.611 --> 07:26.321
until they got back from Springfield.

07:26.405 --> 07:28.073
Yeah. I can't wait that long.

07:28.657 --> 07:29.658
Of course.

07:35.789 --> 07:36.957
Here.

07:38.876 --> 07:40.335
How's it going on Madrigal?

07:41.378 --> 07:43.505
I'm looking for other possible victims.

07:44.173 --> 07:47.509
Pulling unsolved homicide cases,
women who made stalking complaints.

07:47.593 --> 07:51.680
I would keep my search broad,
weed out gang violence--

07:51.763 --> 07:55.434
Domestic disputes.
Yeah, I pulled 136 so far.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.605
You've been with us how many years now?

07:59.688 --> 08:01.023
Three in October.

08:01.523 --> 08:02.608
You're doing good work.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.028
But Dan shouldn't have
brought you in on this.

08:06.862 --> 08:09.364
I was the one who flagged
our initial coverage

08:09.448 --> 08:10.741
on the Madrigal disappearance.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.367
-For who?
-For myself.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.704
By the time Dan showed up,
I had done most of the legwork.

08:16.580 --> 08:17.748
Is he sober?

08:18.290 --> 08:21.126
I mean, you're not new.
You know he took a leave of absence.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.172
You saw a lane and took it.
There's nothing wrong with that.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.257
I started with Dan at The Observer.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.218
I'm the one who brought him here.

08:30.052 --> 08:33.472
But I had to have maintenance drill
a lock on the outside of his old office.

08:33.972 --> 08:37.142
When he'd really spin out,
it was the safest place to keep him.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.058
Whatever-- Whatever--

09:21.019 --> 09:22.354
Anything that would identify him.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.650
All women, all murdered.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.863
It's too much.
Pull up closed cases, suicides.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.364
I don't know. Make less.

09:32.447 --> 09:35.951
That's what I did.
These are all from the last 25 years.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.035
Hey. You there?

09:38.161 --> 09:40.372
Hello? Yeah,
I'll have someone run it over to you.

09:41.123 --> 09:42.541
Okay. Thank you.

09:43.542 --> 09:46.044
Look. Joanne Sellers, 1982.

09:46.128 --> 09:48.005
-Hamilton Park, stabbing.
-Kirby.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.300
-Angela Stevens, 1976--
-Okay. These are blurbs.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.721
It's names, background.
There's not much else here.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.764
That's why I can't rule anyone out.

09:57.848 --> 10:00.642
I can't do anything else
without the police records.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.354
Okay. Leave it here.

10:06.565 --> 10:07.983
We have the tape. I can call it.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.068
We can't use the tape. You stole it.

10:10.652 --> 10:12.279
The police won't like that.

10:14.531 --> 10:15.574
Okay.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.870
Let's say that you get them past it.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.748
You go there, and you tell them
that you recognize the voice.

10:22.831 --> 10:23.832
What can they do?

10:25.125 --> 10:27.127
It's not a credible form of verification,

10:27.211 --> 10:30.422
and you are a source
they already consider unreliable.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.555
Then this is what you have
to write the story with.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.644
How many of these were unsolved?

10:49.942 --> 10:51.652
Why'd you take a leave of absence?

10:56.406 --> 10:58.116
I wanted to spend time with my kid.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.165
You're not going to follow that up?

11:08.168 --> 11:09.878
-You believe me?
-Why shouldn't I?

11:10.504 --> 11:11.630
I don't know.

11:11.713 --> 11:14.675
You already heard something else.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be asking me this.

11:14.758 --> 11:16.510
If you don't want to tell me, you won't.

11:18.554 --> 11:19.763
What did you hear?

11:20.305 --> 11:21.515
Doesn't matter.

11:22.558 --> 11:25.686
-Don't do that. You asked me.
-You didn't answer.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.399
Is Abby checking up on me?
Is that what's going on here?

11:30.482 --> 11:32.442
Yes, but that's not why I wanted to know.

11:33.235 --> 11:34.653
Then why did you?

11:35.237 --> 11:38.574
I've answered everything you've asked me.
I thought you would do the same.

11:40.868 --> 11:44.621
Whatever Abby told you, that's not me.

12:10.022 --> 12:12.357
Lieutenant Hayworth
faxed over your requests.

12:12.441 --> 12:13.734
What favor did you call in?

12:13.817 --> 12:15.944
I'm writing up a profile on him.

12:16.028 --> 12:18.071
Something for him to stick on the fridge.

12:18.155 --> 12:20.532
Yeah. Well, that only buys you
a look at the backup copies.

12:20.616 --> 12:23.118
-That's all I need. I appreciate it.
-Okay.

12:24.620 --> 12:27.247
Miss, everything over there is off-limits.

12:27.915 --> 12:28.916
What's in them?

12:28.999 --> 12:31.627
This site is for cold cases,
five years and older.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.712
Any physical evidence goes in the barrels.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.298
But I keep the DD5s up ahead.

12:36.381 --> 12:38.217
Come on. I have you set up there.

12:51.063 --> 12:52.481
I'll go dig up the rest.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.274
Thanks, Shel.

12:55.692 --> 12:59.029
Here, start with these. Names, DR numbers.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.240
Call out anything you think
you can eliminate.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.298
Fucking ridiculous.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.384
Here, take it.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.512
Lisa? Who's she?

13:23.595 --> 13:26.139
Look at it. That's me, obviously, asshole.

13:26.223 --> 13:27.516
Put 'em back.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.393
You do know nobody cares, right?

13:29.476 --> 13:31.395
Like,
this isn't fucking Idaho or anything.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.105
I'm just gonna go buy them somewhere else.

13:33.188 --> 13:34.273
You go do that.

13:50.372 --> 13:51.540
Excuse me, sir?

13:53.041 --> 13:54.334
Could you do me a favor?

13:54.418 --> 13:57.129
If I give you this ten bucks,
will you buy this for me?

13:57.212 --> 13:59.548
The guy's being a prick,
and I forgot my ID.

14:00.674 --> 14:03.468
Didn't he just give it back to you, Lisa?

14:04.970 --> 14:06.388
Do you want the money or not?

14:06.972 --> 14:08.015
I don't need it.

14:08.098 --> 14:10.267
Fine. Then do it for free.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.357
All of those for you?

14:18.442 --> 14:19.693
Do you care?

14:22.070 --> 14:23.238
Just take 'em.

14:24.489 --> 14:27.159
-He'll check my bag.
-Nah, don't let him see you leave.

14:27.659 --> 14:30.287
That side door over there
puts you on Ashland. Go on.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.247
He'll see me go back there.

14:32.998 --> 14:34.333
Not when he drops his quarters.

14:35.292 --> 14:36.293
What quarters?

14:41.298 --> 14:42.633
You can go now.

15:11.703 --> 15:12.704
Hey.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.333
They just left these out.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.544
That's generally
how things are stored.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.214
Oh, no. I don't drink.

15:24.550 --> 15:26.593
How'd you know about the quarters?

15:26.677 --> 15:28.345
I know everything about this store.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.014
Know everything about the clerk,
about his customers.

15:34.476 --> 15:36.061
But it's the first time I noticed you.

15:41.024 --> 15:43.777
I should go. My friends are waiting.

15:45.362 --> 15:46.446
I'm sure.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.244
-Out through there?
-Straight back.

16:02.671 --> 16:03.797
What are you doing?

16:04.590 --> 16:07.342
I have to go out this way.
Otherwise, he'll know I was down here.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.680
-Right.
-Yeah.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.369
-Where's the door? I don't see it.
-Whoops.

16:35.746 --> 16:37.748
Thought there was one down here.
I guess not.

16:41.502 --> 16:43.504
-Move, or I'll yell for the guy.
-Let him come.

16:43.587 --> 16:45.672
You're the one with his beers in your bag.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.467
Here. Just take it.

16:48.550 --> 16:50.636
No, I told you I don't need your money.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.180
Then what do you want?

16:54.681 --> 16:58.393
-Why did you let me follow you?
-I didn't let you do any--

16:58.477 --> 17:00.604
Yes, you did.
Otherwise, we wouldn't be here.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.023
I don't understand.

17:04.107 --> 17:05.608
You kept walking.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.489
You didn't want to, but you did.

17:12.907 --> 17:16.244
-Where else was I supposed to go?
-Not exactly where I told you to go.

17:17.496 --> 17:18.955
What do you want from me?

17:19.748 --> 17:20.790
Nothing.

17:24.461 --> 17:26.380
You know that it should have taken us…

17:27.881 --> 17:30.676
years to get here?

17:32.052 --> 17:34.096
Why would I follow you any further?

17:36.139 --> 17:39.017
You can't even find the door.

17:47.985 --> 17:50.904
Rebecca Piper. Drug overdose.

17:52.447 --> 17:53.448
You?

17:54.366 --> 17:55.617
Andrea Johnson.

17:56.368 --> 17:59.079
Most likely ex-boyfriend,
but they couldn't prosecute him.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.918
How many do we have left?

18:09.923 --> 18:10.924
What?

18:12.718 --> 18:13.719
Willie Rose.

18:13.802 --> 18:16.138
Body found on Lower Wabash
behind a Caulfield's.

18:18.765 --> 18:19.933
It's the same as mine.

18:22.561 --> 18:23.979
Anything left inside of her?

18:27.941 --> 18:29.193
Debris.

18:30.569 --> 18:32.487
The ME report should list out
the contents.

18:35.365 --> 18:36.700
Only one item found:

18:38.577 --> 18:39.703
gold pin.

18:44.374 --> 18:48.545
This is from over eight years ago.
March of '84.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.256
There'll be more.

19:16.698 --> 19:17.866
Kirby.

19:26.834 --> 19:27.876
Catherine Moore.

19:46.061 --> 19:47.104
Margot Zelle.

19:59.575 --> 20:00.659
Dan.

20:01.410 --> 20:02.411
Karen Polachek.

20:17.009 --> 20:20.345
I found another one. Summer Francis.

20:38.822 --> 20:41.366
Okay, I have to call my kid,
make sure he's home.

21:44.930 --> 21:46.598
Freddie, right?

21:47.099 --> 21:48.767
Yeah, you're Dan Velazquez's boy.

21:48.851 --> 21:51.812
I worked with him at The Observer.
Saw you there a bunch of times.

21:51.895 --> 21:54.648
I mean, you were about this big
at the time. So…

21:55.148 --> 21:56.483
Oh, yeah. Hi.

21:57.192 --> 21:58.402
How's your dad doing?

21:59.403 --> 22:01.989
-Okay, I guess.
-Yeah? Whatcha got?

22:03.866 --> 22:06.118
I don't see any candy in there. No pop.

22:06.702 --> 22:08.954
-Where's all the good stuff?
-This is for my dad.

22:09.037 --> 22:12.374
Oh, making you do all the grunt work?
Yeah.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.001
Sounds like Dan.

22:15.961 --> 22:17.838
-Okay.
-Yeah. I'll see ya.

22:32.352 --> 22:36.064
I haven't seen one of your dad's articles
in a while. Is he still at the Sun-Times?

22:38.358 --> 22:40.277
They don't let him do very much, huh?

22:41.403 --> 22:43.447
I don't know. He's working.

22:44.072 --> 22:45.324
On anything special?

22:47.534 --> 22:48.744
Yeah, probably.

22:49.786 --> 22:51.747
When he works like this,
it's only on big stuff.

22:52.331 --> 22:55.626
Big stuff, like what?

22:57.544 --> 22:58.837
He doesn't tell anyone.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.298
Not before it's done.

23:05.761 --> 23:10.140
Did he ever talk to you about Julia,
the dead girl?

23:10.891 --> 23:11.892
No.

23:11.975 --> 23:13.852
I'm surprised he didn't
tell you about her.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.481
I thought you and your dad were close.

23:20.150 --> 23:21.902
Doesn't talk to me about dead people.

23:24.905 --> 23:27.032
Imagine what else
he's not telling you about.

23:34.164 --> 23:35.374
Here.

23:37.668 --> 23:39.628
Make sure he doesn't work you too hard.

24:02.860 --> 24:04.695
Yeah. Bye-bye.

24:22.421 --> 24:23.422
Kirby?

24:31.972 --> 24:33.140
Kirby?

24:36.435 --> 24:37.436
Kirby?

24:42.191 --> 24:43.442
Kirby?

24:59.416 --> 25:00.918
You can't be back here.

25:01.835 --> 25:04.254
I haven't seen any of this.
Not since the hospital.

25:04.755 --> 25:06.256
Okay, we should--

25:06.882 --> 25:10.052
We should call it a night
and pick up in the morning.

25:11.053 --> 25:13.096
I'm all finished. I found another woman.

25:14.056 --> 25:15.933
With Julia, there's eight of us.

25:18.227 --> 25:19.228
You sure?

25:19.311 --> 25:22.147
They're all the same as me.
I just got to live through it.

25:25.275 --> 25:27.903
Okay, let's get the files copied and go.

25:27.986 --> 25:29.530
I really need to go home.

25:30.113 --> 25:31.114
Okay.

25:32.991 --> 25:34.326
Can we work from there?

25:36.245 --> 25:38.372
We should leave it for tomorrow.

25:39.790 --> 25:40.791
Okay.

25:42.584 --> 25:43.627
That's fine.

25:45.170 --> 25:47.631
I'll take them with me. I can get started.

25:51.969 --> 25:53.387
Okay, we can--

25:53.470 --> 25:55.639
Yeah, we can work at my place.
That's fine.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.516
I only have to get dinner going
for Freddie.

26:01.478 --> 26:02.855
You have to put it back.

26:15.659 --> 26:17.286
He left it inside me.

26:20.914 --> 26:22.207
It's mine.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.084
It's evidence.

26:27.129 --> 26:28.297
There'll be a trial.

26:29.548 --> 26:31.049
And you'll want this to be there.

26:32.384 --> 26:34.678
After he's convicted,
then you get it back.

26:35.512 --> 26:38.682
Hey, we're gonna find him.

26:42.728 --> 26:43.729
'Kay.

27:21.183 --> 27:22.351
I wasn't playing.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.981
Don't lie to me, man.
My hand's burning up.

27:28.565 --> 27:29.900
I wasn't playing.

27:30.901 --> 27:31.985
Yeah, right.

27:32.778 --> 27:33.779
Hey.

27:34.821 --> 27:36.365
Don't be rude.

27:36.949 --> 27:38.909
Say hi to Kirby. She works with me.

27:39.618 --> 27:41.453
-Hi, Kirby.
-Hi, Freddie.

27:43.997 --> 27:45.207
It's not that hot.

27:49.336 --> 27:51.046
Okay, we can set up in here.

27:55.509 --> 27:58.679
Ran into some weird guy
you used to work with. He says hello.

27:59.179 --> 28:00.806
-Who was he?
-I don't know.

28:02.015 --> 28:06.353
Always get names, take notes.
You gotta build the habit, man.

28:36.800 --> 28:40.512
All right. I have coffee, tea.

28:41.013 --> 28:45.184
I think I have some bananas. Beer.

28:46.935 --> 28:48.395
Tea, please.

28:49.605 --> 28:50.814
You need to call Marcus?

28:52.733 --> 28:54.484
You should let him know
you're here, right?

28:56.403 --> 28:57.404
Yeah.

29:00.616 --> 29:02.159
Is this Freddie's mom?

29:02.242 --> 29:04.661
Yeah. Yeah, that's Gina.

29:05.162 --> 29:06.580
He looks more like you.

29:07.080 --> 29:11.418
Oh, bad news. I'm out of tea.

29:12.044 --> 29:13.962
-You want a beer?
-Sure.

29:23.514 --> 29:24.515
Thanks.

29:26.141 --> 29:27.768
Do Freddie and his mom get along?

29:29.520 --> 29:34.650
He adores her, but she's an addict,
among other issues.

29:37.444 --> 29:38.862
So she's not around?

29:38.946 --> 29:39.947
No.

29:40.781 --> 29:42.449
She has to keep her distance.

29:43.075 --> 29:44.284
Is that what you want?

29:52.751 --> 29:53.877
I…

29:54.503 --> 29:57.297
It doesn't go too well
when we're together.

29:57.381 --> 30:00.676
So, we're not.

30:02.553 --> 30:03.720
Phone's over there.

30:04.721 --> 30:07.140
Go call your husband, okay?
It goes a long way.

30:08.517 --> 30:09.518
Okay.

30:18.485 --> 30:20.654
Margot Zelle, 27, 1981.

30:20.737 --> 30:23.115
Her body was found
at the Lakefront Terminal.

30:24.408 --> 30:26.243
The Longshoremen's Union runs that port,

30:26.326 --> 30:28.495
so whoever found her
should still be there.

30:28.579 --> 30:30.789
We can follow up with them. Who's next?

30:31.290 --> 30:36.420
Karen Polachek, 1974. No witnesses.
Her body was found in a boiler room.

30:36.503 --> 30:40.257
She has no family. A nurse.
Just a brother.

30:40.340 --> 30:42.926
He'd be in his 40s now. Local?

30:45.804 --> 30:47.639
There's no follow-up report.

30:48.473 --> 30:51.143
Is there anyone more recent?
Who's the one from '85?

30:51.226 --> 30:53.228
The real estate agent.

30:53.770 --> 30:57.316
She was found by a dumpster
on the Far South Side.

31:01.320 --> 31:02.404
What's all this?

31:04.990 --> 31:09.995
Your address, Marcus's name,
his age, your bus route.

31:11.121 --> 31:13.498
-I take notes, same as you.
-No, these aren't notes.

31:13.582 --> 31:15.375
These aren't notes.

31:15.459 --> 31:16.585
These are--

31:17.419 --> 31:19.379
These are basic facts
that you already know.

31:27.638 --> 31:28.764
I'm in here.

31:32.601 --> 31:33.602
What?

31:34.853 --> 31:37.773
You have a log of every conversation
that we have? What is--

31:40.067 --> 31:43.487
What is this? Why are you doing this?
Who is this for?

31:43.570 --> 31:44.738
It's for me.

31:44.821 --> 31:46.156
Why would you need this?

31:48.200 --> 31:50.494
When I got out of the hospital,
everything was…

31:53.121 --> 31:54.623
Everything was different.

31:55.165 --> 31:57.501
I needed a way to help me navigate.

31:59.795 --> 32:01.380
And you still feel lost?

32:17.729 --> 32:19.356
This can't be making it any easier.

32:19.439 --> 32:20.440
It does.

32:21.692 --> 32:24.736
I think about what happened to me
all the time.

32:26.154 --> 32:27.531
This gives me a reason to.

32:40.127 --> 32:42.087
What's the name of the real estate agent?

32:49.845 --> 32:52.848
Anne Lower. 1985.

32:52.931 --> 32:54.766
The sanitation workers who found her
are listed.

32:54.850 --> 32:58.437
Okay. So, they all had similar wounds.
They were roughly around the same age.

32:58.520 --> 33:02.149
-No witnesses--
-And he left something inside all of us.

33:02.232 --> 33:05.277
Anne had the devotional card.
Karen, the button.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.279
Julia, the radium.

33:07.362 --> 33:08.947
That has to be enough of a connection.

33:09.031 --> 33:11.283
Not to print, no. Not yet.

33:11.783 --> 33:14.077
We can't rely on police records
we're not supposed to have.

33:14.161 --> 33:16.413
We'll have to verify details
with other sources,

33:16.496 --> 33:19.625
with family, witnesses,
whoever is still around.

33:19.708 --> 33:23.170
Of course, it's going to be easier
with the recent victims. But, hey…

33:25.130 --> 33:26.924
there's enough here to get started.

33:28.050 --> 33:30.093
I want to bring this to Abby
tomorrow morning.

33:31.803 --> 33:32.804
Okay.

33:38.936 --> 33:41.021
What did he leave with Summer Francis?

33:44.441 --> 33:45.651
I can't tell.

34:29.987 --> 34:31.029
Hey.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.114
Hey.

34:33.031 --> 34:34.199
Where's your dad?

34:34.824 --> 34:36.952
He said he had to catch Abby early.

34:44.001 --> 34:45.710
It's okay. I've seen worse.

34:55.804 --> 34:57.054
I made coffee for you.

34:58.473 --> 35:00.517
I used to make coffee for my mom too.

35:01.977 --> 35:04.688
She'd let me drink it with her
when we got home.

35:05.647 --> 35:07.274
I just drink it whenever I want.

35:08.609 --> 35:09.693
Here.

35:23.040 --> 35:26.585
-The earliest we found was '72.
-And the wounds are all the same?

35:27.586 --> 35:29.505
There's no suspects in any of these cases?

35:29.588 --> 35:30.881
Not ones that weren't cleared.

35:30.964 --> 35:32.674
And the tapes. Anything useful there?

35:32.758 --> 35:33.926
I'll know tomorrow.

35:34.426 --> 35:35.636
We need CPD to weigh in.

35:35.719 --> 35:41.683
This… blows their suspect
for Julia Madrigal.

35:41.767 --> 35:43.644
The arraignment isn't till next week.

35:43.727 --> 35:46.146
We should let 'em know before then.
Give them time to save face.

35:46.230 --> 35:48.899
I could use their help tracking down
some of the families.

35:48.982 --> 35:50.776
Most of them aren't listed here.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.861
These are a lot of women.

35:54.112 --> 35:55.572
How'd everyone miss this?

35:56.198 --> 35:57.199
How did we?

36:01.203 --> 36:04.414
We need space to run it.
Maybe a series on Sundays.

36:05.499 --> 36:07.918
Which one is your source?
We should lead with her.

36:09.419 --> 36:10.879
Come on, Dan. Who is she?

36:15.175 --> 36:16.510
It's Kirby.

36:16.593 --> 36:19.263
-The fucking archivist?
-She was a reporter, or was about to be.

36:19.346 --> 36:21.431
That's why you've been
dragging her around?

36:21.515 --> 36:24.268
How do you manage to make such
a colossal fucking mess of everything?

36:24.351 --> 36:27.020
She came to me about Julia Madrigal.

36:27.104 --> 36:29.022
-After the cops--
-Why'd she come to you?

36:29.106 --> 36:31.567
-Is there something going on there, Dan?
-Abby, come on.

36:31.650 --> 36:32.693
Are you sleeping with her?

36:33.277 --> 36:36.196
She came to me about Julia Madrigal
after the cops called her in.

36:36.280 --> 36:38.574
-And that's it, okay?
-When were you gonna tell me?

36:39.157 --> 36:41.076
She won't be in the article.

36:42.452 --> 36:44.246
Not after what she had to go through
last time.

36:44.329 --> 36:46.290
She had to change her name and everything.

36:46.373 --> 36:48.458
All these women have been dead for years.

36:48.959 --> 36:51.795
A survivor hunting a serial killer,
that's your story.

36:55.507 --> 36:56.758
I know. I know.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.138
I can't force her.

37:04.766 --> 37:05.809
Hey.

37:11.148 --> 37:12.900
Those clothes are for you.

37:12.983 --> 37:14.568
Did you get any sleep?

37:15.194 --> 37:17.446
Not really.
There was a lot of follow-up on Madrigal.

37:17.529 --> 37:19.281
Yeah, I got your message.
Got your message.

37:19.781 --> 37:21.158
What's Dan got you doing for it?

37:21.241 --> 37:23.702
I had to go to the property warehouse,
pull some records.

37:24.328 --> 37:27.289
-Don't you usually call those in?
-Yeah, but there were so many.

37:27.831 --> 37:29.958
-Dan just folded you in on this?
-Yeah.

37:31.084 --> 37:34.671
Was Gerard Matthiesen here
when you started?

37:34.755 --> 37:36.548
Gerry? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nordic type.

37:37.174 --> 37:39.468
Died a couple of years ago
of stomach cancer. Why?

37:39.551 --> 37:41.261
Would his negatives still be on file?

37:44.431 --> 37:47.100
Well, that's from 1972.
What's this got to do with Madrigal?

37:47.184 --> 37:48.185
Background.

37:50.604 --> 37:53.690
The rolls will be in storage.
I can grab 'em, send 'em up for Dan.

37:53.774 --> 37:55.567
I can look at them.

37:56.151 --> 37:57.110
Why?

37:58.028 --> 37:59.738
I'll know which ones he wants printed.

38:03.116 --> 38:06.203
This is from 20 years ago.
How is this background?

38:07.412 --> 38:09.164
We think it might be the same guy.

38:10.707 --> 38:12.376
You and Dan worked all that out?

38:17.798 --> 38:18.841
Here, try this one.

38:29.977 --> 38:30.978
Who was she?

38:31.061 --> 38:33.814
She was a structural engineer
at Holabird and Root.

38:33.897 --> 38:35.941
All of these are too far away.

38:36.567 --> 38:38.861
-What are you looking for?
-Close-up of her.

38:58.964 --> 39:00.174
Oh, my God.

39:01.300 --> 39:03.302
It's like yours. She's cut like you were.

39:03.385 --> 39:04.887
There's something beside her.

39:04.970 --> 39:06.722
Kirby, what is this story?

39:07.639 --> 39:09.266
We think that I wasn't just random.

39:09.349 --> 39:11.977
There were other women like her,
like Julia.

39:13.896 --> 39:15.564
This is what you're working on with Dan?

39:16.398 --> 39:18.233
That's why you've been like this
since my birthday.

39:18.317 --> 39:20.485
-Kirby, why did you not tell me?
-I wasn't sure yet.

39:23.113 --> 39:24.615
What did the cops say?

39:24.698 --> 39:28.243
Well, they didn't find any of this. I did.

39:30.037 --> 39:31.496
How do you know you're right?

39:32.497 --> 39:35.083
-Look at her.
-I see. I see that.

39:35.167 --> 39:38.045
But is this just you and Dan
pulling shit from storage?

39:39.713 --> 39:41.548
No, this is us breaking a story.

39:42.591 --> 39:45.469
Dan doesn't break stories. He chases them.

39:46.136 --> 39:47.346
He never actually gets there.

39:47.429 --> 39:50.015
They fall apart,
and he disappears after a few weeks.

39:51.350 --> 39:52.643
But this isn't about him.

39:52.726 --> 39:55.562
That's what I'm saying.
Kirby, you're in a good place.

39:56.772 --> 39:58.565
We worked really hard for that.

39:58.649 --> 40:02.444
All of this shit is going to bring you
right back to where you were.

40:03.278 --> 40:05.405
Dan doesn't give a fuck.
He will run right through you.

40:05.489 --> 40:07.783
He will run right through you
to get to nowhere.

40:13.664 --> 40:15.415
This is the one I need printed.

43:19.099 --> 43:20.100
Dad?

43:33.488 --> 43:34.865
-Hey.
-Hey.

43:34.948 --> 43:36.491
I told Freddie to let you sleep.

43:36.575 --> 43:39.244
He did. He was the perfect host.

43:39.328 --> 43:40.704
-I followed up on Summer Francis--
-Yeah.

43:40.787 --> 43:42.706
I need to run something by you first.

43:43.290 --> 43:44.291
Okay.

43:46.418 --> 43:47.836
I told Abby that you're the source.

43:50.422 --> 43:54.551
There's no world we could publish this
without her knowing. There never was.

43:54.635 --> 43:56.803
And you've been here
long enough to know that.

43:56.887 --> 43:58.347
Was she mad?

43:59.097 --> 44:01.308
She got over it, but she has questions.

44:02.226 --> 44:05.938
-Okay.
-Like… why aren't you in the story?

44:08.065 --> 44:10.776
Your assault, your recovery,

44:10.859 --> 44:13.111
how you tracked down
all these other women--

44:13.195 --> 44:15.739
-This is not what we agreed on.
-Then stay anonymous.

44:16.365 --> 44:17.699
I'll keep identifying details out.

44:17.783 --> 44:21.078
We fucked up the police's case.
They're going to leak my name.

44:21.161 --> 44:23.539
-Then what?
-Then you face the firing squad.

44:25.374 --> 44:27.334
You face it.
You tell them what you went through.

44:27.417 --> 44:29.503
And every time somebody asks you
a question,

44:29.586 --> 44:32.047
you remind them of all the murdered
women that they ignored.

44:34.466 --> 44:35.467
I can't.

44:35.551 --> 44:41.181
Listen, if you want this to play,
you have to speak for those women.

44:41.265 --> 44:42.474
You saw my notebook.

44:42.558 --> 44:46.436
When I woke up at your house this morning,
I didn't know if I had spent the night

44:46.520 --> 44:48.730
or if I had been there
for the last five years.

44:48.814 --> 44:50.357
No one should listen to me.

44:52.651 --> 44:53.652
Okay.

44:55.654 --> 44:56.822
Okay, I--

44:57.948 --> 44:59.867
I can try to work off the other seven.

45:00.534 --> 45:01.577
That's not enough?

45:02.077 --> 45:05.122
I'll write it,
but it won't stick with people.

45:05.205 --> 45:06.582
I promise you that.

45:07.249 --> 45:11.587
Listen, Kirby,
these other women, they're bodies.

45:13.380 --> 45:16.800
When you write about the dead,
you write with water.

45:16.884 --> 45:18.969
As soon as you put it down,
it starts to dry up,

45:19.052 --> 45:23.390
and pretty soon there's nothing,
nothing left for anyone to remember.

45:25.350 --> 45:27.603
But you are still here,

45:28.645 --> 45:30.564
and no one could forget you.

45:35.068 --> 45:37.029
And that's what I wanted for the story.

46:35.379 --> 46:36.380
Excuse me.

46:37.422 --> 46:38.882
Yeah, the show has already started.

46:38.966 --> 46:42.302
That's okay.
I think I found a key from here.

46:42.386 --> 46:46.723
That's to a staff locker.
You have the actual key?

46:46.807 --> 46:49.268
Do you keep records of who these
were assigned to?

46:58.735 --> 47:00.445
38's here.

47:00.529 --> 47:02.990
Now, if you have the key,
I'll run it back to her.

47:04.449 --> 47:05.701
She still works here?

47:06.451 --> 47:09.997
Pulsars are
highly magnetic rotating compact stars

47:10.080 --> 47:12.082
that emit beams
of electromagnetic radiation

47:12.165 --> 47:13.834
out of their magnetic poles.

47:13.917 --> 47:16.378
Pulsars start out larger than the sun,

47:16.461 --> 47:19.256
growing so big
they collapse in on themselves.

47:19.756 --> 47:22.759
They die in a massive explosion,

47:22.843 --> 47:25.262
but when it finally burns out,

47:25.345 --> 47:26.722
the pulsar isn't gone.

47:27.973 --> 47:29.892
A small part is left behind.

47:31.101 --> 47:35.314
These stars survive their own deaths.

47:36.231 --> 47:37.816
They still emit light.

47:38.442 --> 47:40.819
They still have a gravitational pull.

47:42.863 --> 47:44.281
They're still with us.

47:57.002 --> 47:59.296
Hey, Dan. You're still here?

47:59.796 --> 48:00.797
Hey.

48:00.881 --> 48:03.634
Just trying to wrap up the day, Marcus.

48:03.717 --> 48:04.801
What's--

48:06.178 --> 48:07.179
Is everything okay?

48:08.931 --> 48:11.642
When I first shot for you,
I bought into your whole vibe.

48:12.142 --> 48:14.645
Anarchy leads to truth,
or whatever it is you're doing.

48:16.522 --> 48:20.108
Abby's kind. She gave you a desk
when no one else would.

48:21.068 --> 48:22.986
You disappoint people
in the name of something bigger,

48:23.070 --> 48:24.738
but there's never anything bigger.

48:25.781 --> 48:27.783
All you do is let people down.

48:31.078 --> 48:33.288
Don't let my wife be one of those people.

48:40.462 --> 48:42.714
Okay, Marcus. You got it.

51:30.674 --> 51:31.925
Hey.

51:32.009 --> 51:34.136
I only caught the end, but that was great.

51:34.219 --> 51:36.471
Stop by next week. We run the same show.

51:36.555 --> 51:37.556
Okay.

51:41.602 --> 51:43.437
Sorry. Excuse me.

51:44.104 --> 51:45.772
I found some keys.

51:45.856 --> 51:50.110
And the woman at the front,
she said they were to your locker.

51:51.403 --> 51:53.280
Yeah.

51:54.573 --> 51:56.450
Yeah, those are mine.
I lost them last week.

51:56.533 --> 51:59.036
-Why did you take a photo?
-These are yours?

51:59.119 --> 52:01.163
I paid 15 bucks for a replacement.
So, yeah.

52:01.747 --> 52:03.790
So do you know who had
the locker before you?

52:03.874 --> 52:06.668
No one.
We just got staff lockers this year.

52:07.544 --> 52:10.589
Look, you can just dump them.
They already replaced the lock.

52:12.007 --> 52:13.634
Do you know a Summer Francis?

52:14.760 --> 52:17.054
Why? Did she steal my keys?

52:17.804 --> 52:20.432
How about a Julia Madrigal?

52:22.601 --> 52:25.479
-No.
-How about Margot Zelle? Sharon Leads?

52:26.313 --> 52:28.315
Am I supposed to know these people?

52:35.656 --> 52:37.824
Hey, are you okay?

52:43.163 --> 52:44.790
Can you please look at this?

52:45.374 --> 52:47.334
Just really make sure they're yours.

52:47.417 --> 52:50.671
What's going on? Where did you find them?

52:51.380 --> 52:55.634
You couldn't have lost these last week.
This photo's from 1972.

52:58.345 --> 53:01.223
I don't think I can help you anymore.

53:23.954 --> 53:24.955
Hey, hold up.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.168
Oh, God.

53:30.794 --> 53:31.795
Oh, man.

53:31.879 --> 53:33.213
Fuck!

53:33.297 --> 53:34.548
-Shit.
-Take it easy.

53:34.631 --> 53:36.216
-Wait. Go slow, go slow.
-Oh, fuck.

53:36.300 --> 53:37.426
-You all right?
-I'm okay.

53:37.509 --> 53:38.510
-Yeah?
-I'm okay.

53:38.594 --> 53:41.471
-Take it easy. Go slow, go slow.
-I'm okay. I'm okay.

53:41.555 --> 53:44.766
Ouch.
I think you got yourself good there.

53:45.642 --> 53:46.643
-Yeah.
-You all right?

53:46.727 --> 53:47.978
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

53:48.061 --> 53:49.563
Yeah, I'm fine.

53:53.275 --> 53:54.484
Mr. Daily News.

53:54.568 --> 53:55.777
That's right.

53:56.445 --> 53:58.197
You could use a hand. Which way you going?

53:58.280 --> 53:59.406
Home.

53:59.489 --> 54:00.490
Home?

54:00.574 --> 54:03.285
Which is this way.

54:19.468 --> 54:21.178
You coming along for the ride?

54:21.678 --> 54:23.680
I thought you lived over by Julia.

54:25.432 --> 54:27.559
I got a gal waiting in Beverly.

54:34.316 --> 54:37.653
-What about you? Anyone waiting?
-No, no. Not tonight.

54:39.571 --> 54:40.656
That's too bad.

54:46.119 --> 54:48.038
So what were you out celebrating?

54:50.040 --> 54:51.041
Finish your article?

54:53.001 --> 54:54.586
It doesn't work like that.

54:54.670 --> 54:55.879
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

54:55.963 --> 54:58.715
But, you know, did you…

55:00.634 --> 55:02.177
find the guy that killed Julia?

55:06.348 --> 55:08.559
You said it wasn't the guy
that got arrested. So…

55:12.271 --> 55:14.231
We're still pulling the story together.

55:19.027 --> 55:20.320
So what do you know about him?

55:27.661 --> 55:28.954
Why do you care, man?

55:31.456 --> 55:35.377
Well, I mean, he killed a woman
four blocks from my house.

55:35.460 --> 55:37.421
Well,
you seem like you can handle yourself.

55:37.504 --> 55:39.256
Oh, come on. I got a kid at home.

55:41.049 --> 55:42.801
I worry about my son as is.

55:43.594 --> 55:45.387
Having this on top of it is just…

55:51.643 --> 55:53.187
Who's taking care of your kid?

55:55.189 --> 55:56.648
He's with my ex tonight.

56:00.903 --> 56:02.279
I never leave him on his own.

56:06.950 --> 56:10.120
So, is this guy from my neighborhood?
Is he still around?

56:14.124 --> 56:15.667
Your son is not his type.

56:16.251 --> 56:17.503
Oh, he's got a type?

56:20.631 --> 56:22.257
So, it wasn't just Julia?

56:24.968 --> 56:26.178
There's more than one?

56:30.057 --> 56:32.559
Did a cop tell you that?

56:34.686 --> 56:35.938
What do they ever know?

56:40.192 --> 56:41.735
Well, then how can you be so sure?

56:46.281 --> 56:48.367
She said he was the same.

56:50.744 --> 56:52.454
Is that where you're getting all this?

56:53.622 --> 56:56.625
Red line train
is approaching the station.

56:56.708 --> 56:57.876
Did--

56:59.086 --> 57:00.462
Did some woman survive?

57:02.297 --> 57:04.174
-That's my train.
-Yeah.

57:20.941 --> 57:22.150
Hey. Whoa.

57:22.693 --> 57:24.444
Easy. Easy.

57:38.292 --> 57:40.210
Stand clear of the closing door.

58:00.230 --> 58:01.398
Next stop…
