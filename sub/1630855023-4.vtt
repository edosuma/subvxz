WEBVTT

00:04.395 --> 00:05.918
[Jughead] Things were dire.

00:05.962 --> 00:07.659
My friend Ethel's parents

00:07.703 --> 00:09.792
had been brutally murdered
the night of the sock hop.

00:09.835 --> 00:12.664
And suddenly, Ethel and I
were the prime suspects.

00:13.796 --> 00:14.710
You drew this picture,

00:15.667 --> 00:17.017
didn't you, Ethel?

00:17.060 --> 00:18.496
And they're meant to be
your mother and father.

00:19.367 --> 00:21.760
Yes, but it was a joke.

00:21.804 --> 00:27.636
Then why did Mr. Jones hide it
under his mattress
like a dirty secret?

00:27.679 --> 00:30.204
And is this where your
far-fetched story

00:30.247 --> 00:32.728
about a killer milkman
came from? A comic book?

00:32.771 --> 00:35.818
No, no. I saw a milkman
leaving my house--

00:35.861 --> 00:38.081
Don't say anything else,
not until we talk to a lawyer.

00:38.125 --> 00:42.651
You know, a picture is worth
a thousand words, Mr. Jones.

00:42.694 --> 00:47.090
And these... Well, these
tell a very disturbing story.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.661
Well...

00:52.704 --> 00:54.750
Well, maybe
they'll be more talkative
down at the station.

01:04.803 --> 01:07.110
Jughead, what's happening?

01:07.154 --> 01:08.329
They're railroading us.

01:08.372 --> 01:09.765
[Sheriff Keller]
Let's go, Jughead.

01:10.853 --> 01:12.289
[students murmuring]

01:16.859 --> 01:20.732
Where do you get off, Andrews,
taking advantage of my sister?

01:20.776 --> 01:23.648
Going all the way with her
at Veronica's make-out party.

01:25.259 --> 01:29.089
Okay, first of all,
you encouraged me
to date Cheryl.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.742
And second of all, I didn't.

01:31.830 --> 01:34.268
We did not go all the way.

01:34.311 --> 01:35.530
That's not what
Cheryl's saying.

01:41.710 --> 01:43.320
[door slams]

01:43.364 --> 01:46.845
Cheryl, why did you
tell your brother
we went all the way?

01:46.889 --> 01:49.152
We didn't, we kissed.
That's all we did.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.459
We did more than that, Archie.

01:51.502 --> 01:54.723
I mean, Bela Lugosi didn't
give me this beauty mark.

01:54.765 --> 01:58.509
Oh, okay, okay.
We barely made it
to second base.

01:58.553 --> 02:01.295
So why tell Julian
we scored a homerun?

02:02.948 --> 02:04.646
I can't explain it.

02:04.689 --> 02:06.691
But by saying that we did,
it's helping me...

02:07.518 --> 02:09.564
with a problem I'm having.

02:10.869 --> 02:13.350
Just know that by
corroborating my story...

02:14.830 --> 02:17.876
you'd be protecting me.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.878
Protecting you?
How and from whom?

02:20.662 --> 02:22.925
My family.

02:22.968 --> 02:24.927
Archie, please don't ask me
any more questions than that.

02:27.321 --> 02:30.498
Anyway, it's just
a little white lie, right?

02:31.542 --> 02:35.242
Really, who is it hurting?

02:37.591 --> 02:41.683
♪ These are
The in-between years ♪

02:41.726 --> 02:43.685
♪ We're going through ♪

02:43.728 --> 02:45.295
I want to give this
back to you, Betty.

02:46.383 --> 02:48.777
[Betty] That was fast.

02:48.820 --> 02:51.345
Did you glean something
from it, at least?

02:51.388 --> 02:52.520
I think so.

02:52.563 --> 02:53.912
I think I know what you want.

02:55.914 --> 02:57.220
And?

02:57.264 --> 02:59.701
And I... I wanna wait
until marriage.

03:02.878 --> 03:03.879
Oh, I see.

03:07.926 --> 03:08.927
Well, how about this?

03:10.929 --> 03:12.583
I'm not okay with you

03:12.627 --> 03:16.065
making all of the decisions
in this relationship, Kevin.

03:16.108 --> 03:19.068
So, as far as I'm concerned,

03:19.111 --> 03:20.809
we're not going steady anymore.

03:26.162 --> 03:28.643
[sighs]

03:28.686 --> 03:30.645
[Toni] Betty, what is it?
Why are you crying?

03:31.646 --> 03:33.213
Kevin and I broke up.

03:33.256 --> 03:36.520
[sighs] Boys ruin everything.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.393
What did he do?

03:39.436 --> 03:42.656
[sighs] Well, we were talking
about having a more
physical relationship.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.835
And an ultimatum was put down.

03:48.445 --> 03:50.534
You wanted to wait
till marriage?

03:53.015 --> 03:56.453
No, Kevin said he wanted
to wait until marriage.

03:58.020 --> 03:59.281
So I broke up with him.

03:59.326 --> 04:02.720
Don't be ashamed
of your desires, Betty.

04:02.764 --> 04:05.245
More girls should do
what you did.

04:05.288 --> 04:08.030
Ask for what they want
from their supposed boyfriends.

04:10.424 --> 04:11.903
What do I do now?

04:11.947 --> 04:15.864
Well, how about you and I
go to the Dark Room

04:15.907 --> 04:17.125
and grab a coffee?

04:17.168 --> 04:18.779
And Betty...

04:18.822 --> 04:22.827
maybe this breakup is exactly
what the doctor ordered.

04:26.570 --> 04:29.138
[Veronica]
How's poor Ethel doing?

04:29.181 --> 04:31.706
I think she's in shock.

04:31.749 --> 04:34.970
I can only imagine.
What are they saying to you?

04:35.013 --> 04:38.974
Not much. Just that they
can only hold us
legally for 24 hours.

04:39.017 --> 04:42.107
After which, they either have
to release us or charge us.

04:42.151 --> 04:43.370
But you were at the dance.

04:43.413 --> 04:44.936
We were all there together.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.982
If there was some way
that we could prove the time

04:47.025 --> 04:50.899
that Ethel's parents
were killed, it might be
enough to clear me.

04:50.942 --> 04:53.467
Then I'd figure out a way
to exonerate Ethel.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.991
Putting on my Nora Charles hat,

04:56.034 --> 04:58.558
doesn't Riverdale
have a coroner?

04:58.602 --> 05:00.996
That would have performed
an autopsy on the Muggs?

05:01.039 --> 05:02.780
Every town has a coroner.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.129
But I don't know who that is.

05:04.173 --> 05:05.348
Let me find out.

05:06.001 --> 05:06.915
I'll be back.

05:08.133 --> 05:11.789
Hey, Veronica... Nora Charles?

05:11.833 --> 05:14.792
The Thin Man
is one of my favorite films.

05:15.837 --> 05:16.881
I had a feeling.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.501
Mom, what's wrong?

05:28.371 --> 05:31.200
Mrs. Blossom just came by.

05:31.243 --> 05:33.768
Is it true what she's saying
you and Cheryl did?

05:37.989 --> 05:40.122
How did this happen?

05:40.165 --> 05:42.907
Mom, I don't really
feel comfortable
discussing this with you.

05:42.951 --> 05:44.561
You think I do?

05:44.605 --> 05:45.909
Never mind.

05:45.954 --> 05:48.130
Just go upstairs
and change into your suit.

05:49.044 --> 05:50.567
Why?

05:50.611 --> 05:53.135
Because we're going over
to the Blossoms' for dinner,

05:53.178 --> 05:57.531
to figure out a path
through this mess
that you and Cheryl made.

06:11.588 --> 06:13.895
[soft music playing]

06:24.645 --> 06:27.561
So, how was your trip
to Washington, Mr. Mayor?

06:27.604 --> 06:29.606
Oh, Mary, please.
It's Clifford.

06:29.650 --> 06:33.523
As for my trip, well,
it was, uh...
It was productive.

06:35.090 --> 06:37.222
But...

06:37.266 --> 06:40.617
to come home
to our fair town
torn asunder.

06:40.661 --> 06:45.056
Two murders,
and our young people
in crisis.

06:45.100 --> 06:48.146
World has indeed gone sideways.
Joe was right.

06:48.190 --> 06:49.626
Senator McCarthy.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.023
So, tell me, Archie.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.590
What do you think
of the Russia problem?

06:59.331 --> 07:00.202
The Russia problem, sir?

07:01.638 --> 07:05.294
The Russians.
Arming themselves against us,

07:05.337 --> 07:07.992
infiltrating us, undermining
our very way of life.

07:10.255 --> 07:11.126
Well...

07:14.085 --> 07:15.739
Well, Russia is a big...

07:17.698 --> 07:19.090
It's a massive problem, sir.

07:19.134 --> 07:20.614
It's, I mean, clearly...

07:22.180 --> 07:24.400
You're a very smart
young man, Archie.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.141
You remind me of your father.

07:26.184 --> 07:30.145
Fred was a decent,
hard working,
red-blooded American.

07:30.188 --> 07:31.929
Thank you, sir.

07:31.973 --> 07:34.584
Mary, after dinner, I think
we should adjourn to my study.

07:34.628 --> 07:35.803
We have much to discuss.

07:39.241 --> 07:40.982
[Cheryl] I'm sorry
I never got to meet your dad.

07:42.766 --> 07:43.941
You must miss him a lot.

07:45.595 --> 07:46.640
Yeah, he was...

07:47.554 --> 07:48.772
He was my best friend.

07:49.991 --> 07:51.079
That is so sweet.

07:52.863 --> 07:56.345
We used to go to the movies
almost every weekend.

07:56.388 --> 07:59.000
-Westerns,
those were his favorites.
-[chuckles softly]

08:00.001 --> 08:01.698
Mine too.

08:01.742 --> 08:04.527
And afterwards we'd go
to Pop's for burgers.

08:04.571 --> 08:08.313
We'd joke about riding
out west to California,
to live on a ranch.

08:08.357 --> 08:09.706
[both laugh]

08:09.750 --> 08:10.838
Being cowboys.

08:15.016 --> 08:17.105

when Mr. and Mrs. Muggs
were murdered.

09:28.916 --> 09:32.354
This doesn't account
for Ethel's whereabouts
at the time of the murders.

09:32.397 --> 09:34.399
That may be the case.

But you can at least
release Jughead, can't you?

Mm.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.593
I think they were trying
to starve me in there.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.682
Thankfully, I managed
to get Ethel
to finally open up.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.988
She told you where she was
when her parents were killed?

09:58.032 --> 10:01.470
Mm-hmm. And her reluctance
to fess up makes sense too.

It turns out, she was doing
the car seat cha-cha
with, get this...

10:06.823 --> 10:08.129
Julian Blossom.

10:10.305 --> 10:12.655
Ethel was waiting
at the bus stop
to go to the dance

10:12.699 --> 10:15.832
when Julian drove by
and offered to take her.

10:15.876 --> 10:16.964
You going to the dance?

10:18.705 --> 10:19.967
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.320
[Jughead] When instead,
he took her to Lover's Lane

10:25.363 --> 10:28.149
and then tried
to put the moves on her.

10:28.192 --> 10:30.151
As Ethel described it,
she welcomed it at first.

10:30.194 --> 10:33.241
But Julian decided
to get a little handsy.

10:34.329 --> 10:35.156
[Julian grunts]

10:37.375 --> 10:39.290
[Jughead] Julian warned her
not to say anything

10:39.334 --> 10:42.032
and that if she did, he would
call her a nymphomaniac.

10:42.076 --> 10:43.817
Make her the town
laughingstock.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.165
[Veronica sighs]

10:45.209 --> 10:47.516
Of course, we know
what happened after that.

10:47.559 --> 10:49.866
When she decided to go home
instead of the dance.

10:50.562 --> 10:51.999
Terrible.

10:52.042 --> 10:54.697
I say we talk to Julian
at school tomorrow.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.177
Ethel thinks
that ratting him out

10:56.220 --> 10:57.308
is only going to make
things worse for her.

10:57.352 --> 10:58.658
And she may be right.

11:00.050 --> 11:02.183
So it's up to Julian
to do the honorable thing.

11:03.619 --> 11:04.707
God help us.

11:08.798 --> 11:10.713
[door opens]

11:14.674 --> 11:16.937
And where have you been,
young lady?

11:16.980 --> 11:20.114
I was just having coffee
with my friend Toni.

11:21.115 --> 11:25.554
Hmm. Well, Mrs. Keller called.

11:25.597 --> 11:27.469
Did you break up
with Kevin today?

Oh, Betty, why did you do that?

He's devastated.

Mrs. Keller doesn't know
where he is.

She's worried sick.

11:38.872 --> 11:40.090
Kevin is fine.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.223
I just saw him
at the coffeehouse.

11:42.266 --> 11:45.095
And rest assured, he's found
a shoulder to cry on.

11:45.139 --> 11:46.749
A very manly shoulder.

11:48.272 --> 11:50.100
And?

11:50.144 --> 11:52.668
And looking back, that's been
the problem with
us this whole time, Mom.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.235
Kevin likes boys.

11:55.236 --> 11:57.020
Oh, Elizabeth.

Even if he does,
it's just a phase.

12:07.639 --> 12:11.208
See, carnal passion like that,
it never lasts.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.470
It will fade.

12:12.514 --> 12:14.821
And then, eventually,
he'll be ready to--

12:14.864 --> 12:15.909
To what?

12:15.952 --> 12:17.737
To kiss me? To want to kiss me?

To marry you.

12:19.434 --> 12:20.740
To settle down.

marry and live with Kevin,

12:25.832 --> 12:27.703
knowing the truth now?

You and Kevin,

12:29.313 --> 12:32.142
you've been building
a relationship for two years.

12:32.186 --> 12:33.840
I know.

kind of sexual identity crisis,

12:36.581 --> 12:39.106
don't you owe it to him
to help him through it?

12:40.760 --> 12:42.413
If only as a friend.

12:50.030 --> 12:51.596
[light buzzing]

12:51.640 --> 12:53.033
Holy heck.

12:58.429 --> 12:59.387
[sighs]

13:13.618 --> 13:14.837
Hot Dog.

13:18.275 --> 13:19.494
Where'd they take you, boy?

13:23.411 --> 13:24.325
Well... [sighs]

13:25.326 --> 13:26.980
That was torture.

13:27.023 --> 13:30.070
Well, Mr. Blossom said
some nice stuff
about Dad, at least.

13:30.113 --> 13:33.247
Oh, Clifford Blossom
has always been a hypocrite.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.815
And a war profiteer
and a draft dodger.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.729
How is he a war profiteer?

13:37.773 --> 13:41.124
He sold maple syrup
to the Army at a premium
during the Korean War.

13:41.995 --> 13:43.561
[sighs]

13:43.605 --> 13:45.781
I've always managed to give
the Blossoms a wide berth.

13:45.825 --> 13:49.480
But now, thanks to you,
we'll be linked
for the rest of our lives.

13:50.612 --> 13:53.180
What are you talking about?

13:53.223 --> 13:55.312
The Blossoms and I
have had a long talk.

13:55.356 --> 13:59.447
And we've decided that,
based on your actions,

13:59.490 --> 14:01.623
the best thing to do
would be for you and Cheryl...

14:02.624 --> 14:03.538
to get married.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.020
Married?

14:07.063 --> 14:09.283
Aren't Cheryl and I
too young to do that?

14:09.326 --> 14:12.939
Dr. Werthers will be giving
you and Cheryl a test tomorrow.

14:12.982 --> 14:14.679
I have to take a test now too?

14:14.723 --> 14:16.681
A compatibility test.

14:16.725 --> 14:19.728
Cupid's checklist, to make sure
that you and Cheryl are--

14:19.771 --> 14:21.164
Compatible.

14:21.208 --> 14:24.472
Yes, and psychologically
ready to get married.

14:25.995 --> 14:27.170
[clears throat]

14:28.998 --> 14:30.652
Mom, this can't be
what you want for me.

14:30.695 --> 14:31.653
It isn't.

14:32.828 --> 14:34.438
But if you're old enough to...

14:35.918 --> 14:37.441
do what you did,

14:37.485 --> 14:40.140
then you're old enough
to take responsibility for it.

14:40.183 --> 14:42.185
Think of Cheryl's honor.

14:42.229 --> 14:45.232
That poor girl's reputation
could be destroyed.

14:45.275 --> 14:46.886
And I know you don't want that.

14:59.420 --> 15:03.554
Gosh, Midge... Are you sure?

15:03.598 --> 15:04.555
I'm never late.

15:05.252 --> 15:06.862
I'm scared, Fangs.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.082
Don't worry, baby.
I love you.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.388
We're going to figure this out.
I promise.

15:18.352 --> 15:20.658
[scoffs] What do you two want?

15:20.702 --> 15:23.487
We know that you were
with Ethel before
arriving to the dance.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.493
Is that what Ethel says?

15:29.537 --> 15:31.365
[scoffs] She wishes.

15:31.408 --> 15:34.150
[chuckles]
You're a terrible liar.

15:34.194 --> 15:36.283
If you already know
the whole story,
then why the third degree?

15:36.326 --> 15:38.415
Because they're trying
to bamboozle Ethel.

15:38.459 --> 15:41.114
You were the only one
that was with her when
her parents were eighty-sixed.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.637
So you can be her alibi.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.856
But you need to tell the truth
to Sheriff Keller.

15:44.900 --> 15:45.770
I'm not doing that.

15:45.814 --> 15:46.728
Why not?

15:46.771 --> 15:47.642
I'm a Blossom.

15:48.643 --> 15:50.862
It would be...

15:50.906 --> 15:53.953
unseemly for me to admit
that I made a play
for someone as...

15:55.519 --> 15:58.174
inappropriate
as Ethel Muggs.

15:58.218 --> 16:00.524
Then why do it
in the first place?

16:00.568 --> 16:02.048
I don't know.

16:02.091 --> 16:03.179
Cheap thrills, I guess.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.791
What the hell, Jones?

16:06.835 --> 16:08.489
You disgust me, Julian.

16:08.532 --> 16:11.144
People like you
make my stomach churn.

16:11.187 --> 16:13.407
You're rich.
You're entitled.

16:13.450 --> 16:16.105
You strut around the world
like you own it.

16:16.149 --> 16:19.761
And then you take
advantage of people
like my friend, Ethel.

16:19.804 --> 16:22.503
So you're going to do
the right thing
for once in your life.

16:33.644 --> 16:35.124
Julian gave a statement.

16:35.168 --> 16:36.517
Ethel's free to go, right?

16:36.560 --> 16:38.736
Yeah. She's no longer
an active suspect.

16:38.780 --> 16:41.217
Though an adult is gonna need
to sign her out.

16:41.261 --> 16:44.133
The Coopers are on their way.
They've agreed
to take her in again.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.703
[Dr. Werthers]
My compatibility test,

16:48.746 --> 16:50.444
or, uh, Cupid's checklist,

16:50.487 --> 16:52.707
shall we say, consists
of only three questions.

16:55.797 --> 16:57.016
First question.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.235
Do you come
from similar backgrounds?

16:59.279 --> 17:02.630
The Blossoms are descended
from European
barons and baronesses.

17:03.587 --> 17:05.546
Um, my dad used to talk about

17:05.589 --> 17:08.896
how Grandpa Artie and his wife
barely survived the Dust Bowl.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.029
Very good.

17:11.943 --> 17:13.423
Second question.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.077
Are you close friends?

17:15.121 --> 17:18.166
[scoffs] Um...

17:18.211 --> 17:22.040
You know, I pride myself
on getting along
with pretty much everyone.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.259
Hmm.

17:26.348 --> 17:28.221
Last question.

17:28.263 --> 17:30.658
Do you understand
the concept of marriage?

17:34.270 --> 17:36.533
Uh... Um...

17:36.577 --> 17:39.623
Marriage is not to be
taken lightly, Ms. Blossom.

17:41.016 --> 17:44.367
And you, Mr. Andrews,
you must remain faithful.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.717
It goes against our nature
as men, of course.

17:46.761 --> 17:48.502
But...

17:48.545 --> 17:52.114
a kind word, sympathetic ear
and a home-cooked meal

17:52.158 --> 17:56.292
can go a long way
towards keeping
a wandering eye in check.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.253
Have I clarified things?

18:03.343 --> 18:07.173
[Penelope] Well, that is such
a relief to hear, Dr. Werthers.

18:07.216 --> 18:09.262
Mrs. Andrews and I are elated.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.568
Yes, we'll talk soon.

18:11.612 --> 18:12.656
My best to Myrna.

18:14.615 --> 18:17.922
The most wonderful news,
Mary, dear.

18:17.966 --> 18:19.489
The children are compatible.

18:19.533 --> 18:22.623
Well, frankly, I'm surprised.

18:22.666 --> 18:27.062
You know, Archie and Cheryl
are so different.

18:27.106 --> 18:31.197
Well, they both have that
glorious red hair, don't they?

18:38.856 --> 18:41.424
[Toni] Hey, Fangs.
How's it hanging?

18:41.468 --> 18:44.297
Not well, Toni.

18:44.340 --> 18:47.561
Midge thinks that she
might be in trouble.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.737
Oh, jeez.

18:49.780 --> 18:50.825
Are you sure?

18:50.868 --> 18:53.567
Not 100%, but, yeah,
pretty sure.

18:54.829 --> 18:56.526
Okay, well,
first things first.

18:56.570 --> 18:59.181
We need to confirm that Midge
is, in fact, pregnant.

19:00.487 --> 19:02.097
Here's what we're going to do.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.620
You, me and Midge
are going to meet

19:03.664 --> 19:06.362
at the biology lab
at school tonight at midnight.

19:06.406 --> 19:09.844
That'll give me enough time
to gather the supplies
we need to make our own test.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.152
Can you dig it?

19:14.109 --> 19:15.066
Big Daddy?

19:15.110 --> 19:16.285
[sighs]

19:18.548 --> 19:20.333
[piano music playing]

19:26.121 --> 19:28.297
Kev, can we talk?

19:30.865 --> 19:31.779
[door closes]

19:33.824 --> 19:35.870
I went to the Dark Room
last night,

19:38.307 --> 19:39.917
and I saw you and Clay there.

19:39.961 --> 19:43.704
[scoffs] Yeah, I don't know
what you think you saw,

19:43.747 --> 19:45.358
but Clay and I were just
kidding around.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.927
No.
No, you weren't.

19:55.063 --> 19:56.760
How long have you and Clay...

20:00.590 --> 20:02.810
[sighs] Last night
was the first time.

20:05.987 --> 20:09.556
After you broke up with me,
I went to the gym and...

20:09.599 --> 20:12.341
just was bawling
my eyes out and...

20:13.690 --> 20:15.562
Clay was in the locker room

20:15.605 --> 20:17.955
and he just heard me,
and he came
and just talked to me and...

20:23.918 --> 20:25.789
I'm sorry.

20:25.833 --> 20:29.184
I know this must be
throwing you for a loop,
but just believe me.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.577
If I had known what...

20:31.926 --> 20:34.972
I... I was, I wouldn't
have wasted your time.

20:39.977 --> 20:44.330
I'm not going to pretend
that I understand most of this.

20:46.419 --> 20:48.899
But our relationship
was not a waste of time.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.251
At least not to me.

20:57.473 --> 21:00.346
[bright pop music playing]

21:01.956 --> 21:04.785
[both slurping]

21:09.093 --> 21:11.792
Well, I guess it's happening.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.012
Mr. and Mrs. Andrews.

21:15.796 --> 21:16.753
So, it seems.

21:21.062 --> 21:24.718
Cheryl, are you... Are you sure
you really wanna
go through with this?

21:24.761 --> 21:26.241
Would it really be that bad?

21:26.285 --> 21:27.460
To be married to you?

21:27.503 --> 21:29.940
No. Oh, heck, no.

21:33.422 --> 21:36.643
I just... I wanna
get to know you better.

21:36.686 --> 21:40.647
And through that process,
maybe I'll get to know
myself better too.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.823
I think it's easy
to figure out your path

21:42.866 --> 21:45.304
when someone's
walking alongside you.

21:48.611 --> 21:53.355
Word around school is
you wrote Veronica
a beautiful love poem.

21:53.399 --> 21:58.360
Maybe you could
find it in your heart
to write one for me.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.014
Yeah, yeah. Sure I can.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.065
[jazz music playing]

22:08.109 --> 22:09.415
To small victories.

22:09.458 --> 22:10.851
Hear, hear!

22:10.894 --> 22:12.809
Though Ethel's not out
of the woods just yet.

22:12.853 --> 22:16.117
No, but she's in a better place
than she was two hours ago.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.207
[Jughead clears throat]

22:19.250 --> 22:21.818
We make a good team, Nick.

22:21.862 --> 22:23.951
Yes, we do, Nora.

22:23.994 --> 22:24.908
[chuckles]

22:26.257 --> 22:29.391
So, after dinner,

22:29.435 --> 22:32.263
what do you think
about walking me home?

22:32.307 --> 22:34.178
Oh, shucks...

22:34.222 --> 22:36.964
I was actually planning
on staying here tonight.

22:37.007 --> 22:37.878
At the diner?

22:38.879 --> 22:40.446
Why?

22:40.489 --> 22:42.622
Sheriff Keller
and his goon squad
trashed my train car.

22:43.057 --> 22:43.927
Oh.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.540
Well...

22:47.583 --> 22:49.455
do you want to stay
at the Pembrooke?

22:50.586 --> 22:52.196
[both chuckle]

22:52.240 --> 22:54.982
No, no. I'm...
I'm allergic to silk sheets.

22:56.549 --> 22:58.333
You're in luck, then.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.727
Because we only
have sheets made

23:00.770 --> 23:03.382
from the finest
Egyptian cotton.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.254
Well, I wouldn't
wanna crowd you.

23:06.297 --> 23:08.474
Please. There's an entire
wing of the apartment

23:08.517 --> 23:09.736
I haven't even set foot in.

23:11.215 --> 23:12.652
Really, I insist.

23:20.007 --> 23:22.444
-[frog croaking]
-I'm confused, Toni.

23:22.488 --> 23:25.752
How will any of this stuff
tell us whether or not
I'm pregnant?

23:25.795 --> 23:28.015
It's a simple process.

23:28.058 --> 23:31.671
I'm going to inject
some of your pee
into our friend here.

23:31.714 --> 23:33.629
And if you're pregnant,
it's gonna cause

23:33.673 --> 23:37.546
a chemical reaction
in the frog, causing it
to lay eggs overnight.

23:37.590 --> 23:39.374
Will it hurt the frog?

23:39.418 --> 23:42.290
No, it's quick and painless.

23:42.333 --> 23:43.857
Promise.

23:43.900 --> 23:47.295
Okay, I got Midge's pee
in a cup in a bag here.

23:47.338 --> 23:49.906
So why don't you two
just wait outside
and I'll be out in a jiffy?

23:51.299 --> 23:52.996
[frog croaking]

24:03.964 --> 24:05.574
[frog croaking]

24:07.358 --> 24:10.927
Well, Midge,
you're definitely preggers.

24:10.971 --> 24:14.191
There's like,
400-500 eggs in there.

24:14.235 --> 24:16.629
Oh, my God.

24:16.672 --> 24:18.892
All right.
Fangs, Midge, listen up.

24:18.935 --> 24:20.763
Do you two love each other?

24:20.807 --> 24:23.070
-Yeah, we do.
-Completely.

24:23.113 --> 24:25.768
All right. Fangs, you're going
to have to clean yourself up.

24:25.812 --> 24:27.640
Wash the grease
out of your hair,

24:27.683 --> 24:29.250
put on a button-up shirt

24:29.293 --> 24:31.948
and go ask the Klumps
for Midge's hand in marriage.

24:31.992 --> 24:34.298
I'd do anything for Midge.

24:34.342 --> 24:37.650
But no way will her folks
give us their blessing.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.956
Well, you're gonna
at least have to try.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.785
And maybe they'll surprise you.

24:42.829 --> 24:46.180
But, I wouldn't tell them
that Midge has a bun
in the oven just yet.

24:52.795 --> 24:53.970
[plates clanking]

24:54.014 --> 24:57.800
Good morning.
What's all this?

24:57.844 --> 24:59.933
Well, I woke up early.
I figured I'd make you

24:59.976 --> 25:01.804
a little breakfast
as a show of gratitude.

25:02.457 --> 25:04.459
Little?

25:04.503 --> 25:07.549
My typical breakfast
consists of half a grapefruit
and a cup of coffee.

25:07.593 --> 25:11.379
I feel like I'm at
the Polo Lounge
having Sunday brunch.

25:11.422 --> 25:14.208
How did you sleep?
Were the sheets to your liking?

25:14.251 --> 25:16.210
I slept like a log.

25:16.253 --> 25:18.995
But I'll admit,
I do feel a bit like
Little Orphan Annie in here.

25:19.039 --> 25:22.085
Which makes me, who?
Daddy Warbucks?

25:25.567 --> 25:27.003
Should we walk
to school together?

25:27.917 --> 25:29.266
I'm skipping school today.

25:29.310 --> 25:32.618
I have to go to the pound
and spring Hot Dog.

25:32.661 --> 25:34.663
And then I have to fix up
my train car.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.056
Well then, I'll skip too.

25:38.101 --> 25:40.408
Why don't you focus
on getting Hot Dog

25:40.451 --> 25:42.802
and I'll focus on
sprucing up your train car?

25:45.674 --> 25:46.936
[Betty] Wait a minute.

25:46.980 --> 25:49.112
You and Cheryl
didn't go all the way?

25:50.723 --> 25:53.334
But now you two
are getting married?

25:53.377 --> 25:54.640
I know. It's confusing.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.076
It's lunacy, Arch.

25:56.119 --> 25:57.599
Why don't you just tell
your mom the truth,

25:57.643 --> 25:59.340
so you don't have
to do any of this?

25:59.383 --> 26:01.037
Cheryl's in trouble, Betty.

26:01.081 --> 26:03.823
And I want to protect her.

26:03.866 --> 26:05.694
And it's weird to say,
but if I can save her

26:05.738 --> 26:07.827
from something,
it might help me...

26:09.437 --> 26:10.569
I don't know.

26:10.612 --> 26:12.658
Figure out my purpose in life.

26:15.269 --> 26:16.270
But do you love her?

26:19.752 --> 26:20.840
-I could.
-[sighs]

26:20.883 --> 26:22.276
I mean, according
to Dr. Werthers,

26:22.319 --> 26:23.973
love grows over time.
He showed us a graph.

26:24.017 --> 26:25.932
It starts when you're 17
and it peaks when you're 21.

26:25.975 --> 26:27.977
I mean, that's when you
really start loving someone.

26:28.021 --> 26:32.112
Arch, there's a difference
between saving someone
and loving someone.

26:32.155 --> 26:35.289
What if the love never grows?

26:35.332 --> 26:40.555
Archie. My father
has requested a sit-down
with us after school.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.601
I trust you can
accommodate him.

26:42.644 --> 26:44.646
-I'll be there.
-Wunderbar.

26:44.690 --> 26:45.778
I'll let him know.

26:47.475 --> 26:48.389
Betty.

26:53.176 --> 26:55.526
You're a wonderful guy, Arch.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.964
And it's really sweet
that you wanna help Cheryl.

26:58.007 --> 27:01.402
But marriage is forever.

27:03.491 --> 27:04.971
It's the rest of your life.

27:09.932 --> 27:14.284
[Clifford] So very happy
to hear that you passed
Dr. Werthers' evaluation.

27:14.328 --> 27:16.678
I suppose you're both wondering
what happens next.

27:16.722 --> 27:20.464
Well, we were thinking
of a small ceremony
at Niagara Falls.

27:20.508 --> 27:21.988
Don't be asinine, Cheryl.

27:22.031 --> 27:24.338
You're going to be married
by a judge at Thornhill.

27:24.381 --> 27:27.863
And I will set Archie up
with a part-time job
at the Naval factory.

27:27.907 --> 27:29.604
And you'll both graduate
high school, of course.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.258
And college as well.

27:31.301 --> 27:32.999
That's a waste
of time and money.

27:33.042 --> 27:35.001
After high school,
you, Archie, will enter into

27:35.044 --> 27:37.351
the Blossom Management
Training program.

27:37.394 --> 27:41.398
And once that's completed,
we'll start you on full-time.

27:41.442 --> 27:43.705
Cheryl will help her mother
manage Thornhill,

27:43.749 --> 27:45.968
eventually learning how
to run the estate herself.

27:46.012 --> 27:47.666
Why? It's not as if
we're gonna live here.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.493
Certainly you will.

27:49.537 --> 27:50.756
Where else are you gonna live?

27:52.627 --> 27:55.195
Well, Cheryl and I haven't
talked about it yet, sir,

27:55.238 --> 27:58.851
but I was thinking we could
move into my parent's house.

27:58.894 --> 28:01.680
Cheryl? In that hovel?

28:03.943 --> 28:05.292
[jazz music playing]

28:19.262 --> 28:20.437
Wow!

28:20.481 --> 28:24.659
I barely even
recognized you, Fangs.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.921
How did it go with the Klumps?

28:25.965 --> 28:27.183
It went horrible.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.012
They had a conniption.

28:31.448 --> 28:35.235
Forbade me from
ever seeing Midge again.

28:35.278 --> 28:37.846
Yeah, I was afraid
that was gonna happen.

28:38.542 --> 28:39.892
Midge is rich.

28:39.935 --> 28:42.416
She's white,
her parents love her.

28:42.459 --> 28:46.072
And on top of it all, you're
a greaser wannabe rockstar.

28:46.550 --> 28:48.074
Oh, jeez.

28:49.423 --> 28:51.251
What do I do, Toni?

28:51.294 --> 28:53.253
You do exactly
what the Klumps say.

28:53.949 --> 28:56.256
Stay away from Midge.

28:56.299 --> 28:57.953
They don't know she's pregnant.

28:57.997 --> 29:00.608
You got four months before
she starts to show.

29:00.651 --> 29:03.219
Which means we have
four months to make you into

29:03.263 --> 29:05.004
a Ritchie Valens-type
rock star.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.790
Huh?

29:08.834 --> 29:12.141
Once you become rich and famous
and undeniable,
you'll re-propose to Midge

29:12.185 --> 29:14.100
and they'll have no choice
but to give you their blessing.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.320
You're in love.

29:17.364 --> 29:21.411
Like a Romeo and Juliet
kind of love.

29:21.455 --> 29:23.370
No matter what,
you and Midge will be together.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.898
Well, do you fellas approve?

29:32.596 --> 29:36.905
Wow! You really
are like Daddy Warbucks.

29:36.949 --> 29:40.561
I consulted with some of my set
decorator friends out West.

29:40.604 --> 29:43.564
I could have done more,
but time was very limited.

29:43.607 --> 29:44.521
Are you kidding?

29:46.045 --> 29:48.569
It's like the Orient Express.

29:48.612 --> 29:50.179
Without the murder, of course.

29:50.223 --> 29:51.137
Of course.

29:53.530 --> 29:55.271
You know, Jughead,
you and Hot Dog

29:55.315 --> 29:57.970
are more than welcome to stay
at the Pembrooke.

29:58.013 --> 30:00.668
Um, golly, uh...

30:00.711 --> 30:04.498
I appreciate the offer.
I'm just a creature of habit.

30:05.629 --> 30:06.500
As is Hot Dog.

30:09.111 --> 30:12.593
But thank you for everything.
This is... Gosh.

30:13.420 --> 30:14.377
My pleasure.

30:18.729 --> 30:21.602
All right. Well, I will
leave you boys to it.

30:25.824 --> 30:26.825
Bye.

30:36.573 --> 30:38.184
Do you wanna explain
this to me?

30:39.707 --> 30:41.491
What were you doing in my room?

30:41.535 --> 30:42.666
Cleaning it.

30:42.710 --> 30:45.147
Now tell me,
why do you have this book?

30:45.191 --> 30:47.367
[sighs]
I was reading it, Mom.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.369
To try to make
some sense of my life,

30:49.412 --> 30:52.851
since everything that you
tell me is backwards
and nonsensical.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.722
Watch your tone, little miss.

30:54.765 --> 30:57.203
A girl your age should not
be reading this filth.

30:57.246 --> 30:59.466
Well, then when, Mom?

30:59.509 --> 31:02.164
And it's not filth.
It's just the truth.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.036
Where did you even find this?

31:04.079 --> 31:05.167
[Ethel] It's mine.

31:08.518 --> 31:12.479
It was at my house.
That's where Betty found it,
Mrs. Cooper.

31:12.522 --> 31:16.048
I ordered it from a catalog
through the mail.

31:16.091 --> 31:19.834
Oh, Ethel. Why am I
not surprised?

31:19.878 --> 31:21.140
It doesn't matter
where I got it.

31:21.183 --> 31:22.489
And I'm not done
reading it yet.

After that crazy talk
with your dad,

32:07.360 --> 32:11.625
this whole plan is suddenly
feeling really wrong to me.

32:11.668 --> 32:13.975
I understand, Archie.

32:14.019 --> 32:15.020
I do.

32:15.063 --> 32:17.457
I demanded too much of you.

to marry into my life,

That's my cross,

32:42.308 --> 32:43.483
You could get away
from your family.

32:43.526 --> 32:45.050
I could get a job on a ranch.

32:46.529 --> 32:49.141

we can find ourselves.

weighing you down here.

If only it were that easy.

33:02.589 --> 33:04.025
It can be.

33:04.069 --> 33:05.244
We just have to do it.

33:09.161 --> 33:10.901
Okay.

33:10.945 --> 33:12.773
Okay, let's try, Archie.

about men like you.

off of our relationship.

You went to my mom for advice?

34:03.389 --> 34:06.044
No, she...
She reached out to me.

would be a huge mistake.

34:32.679 --> 34:36.074
You don't understand
my situation.

from Riverdale, your family.

and move across the country.

have to look at yourself

35:28.343 --> 35:31.085
in the mirror and face
who you really are.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.695
Otherwise,
you'll just wither away.

Mom, where's Ethel?

35:47.014 --> 35:48.320
Why, she's gone, dear.

35:49.451 --> 35:51.932
Gone? Gone where?

35:51.975 --> 35:54.543
I called my friend Janet
at Social Services,

35:54.587 --> 35:56.066

it would be best

35:56.110 --> 35:58.330
that we send Ethel
to The Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

35:58.373 --> 36:01.115

are bonkers.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.508
They do experiments on people.

36:02.551 --> 36:04.249
They do not, Elizabeth.

36:04.292 --> 36:06.207
That rumor has been debunked.

It's what's best for Ethel.

Trust me. I know
I'm right about this.

Is that what you said to Kevin
when you told him to pin me?

36:16.826 --> 36:19.873
What on earth
are you talking about?

36:19.916 --> 36:24.182
Did you give this to Kevin
and tell him to pin me, Mother?

36:24.225 --> 36:26.880
To settle me and my urges down?

36:26.923 --> 36:29.883
I may have given
some advice in passing.

36:29.926 --> 36:31.624
Oh, come off it, Mom.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.365

and you'll thank me for it.
