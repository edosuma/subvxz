00:06.256 --> 00:09.592
Oh, my God! We've been waiting
here for like 20 hours!

00:09.676 --> 00:10.677
You know they should
invent a bank

00:10.760 --> 00:13.346
where actual people help you.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.348
What's your rush?

00:15.432 --> 00:17.225
- I can't tell you.
- Fine.

00:17.308 --> 00:20.061
Seriously, you can't know.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.771
- Okay.
- Stop it.

00:21.855 --> 00:25.150
It has nothing to do
with your Christmas present.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.277
I have to go now
or the place is gonna close.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.319
- So go.
- Well, I can't.

00:28.403 --> 00:29.738
I have to deposit my paycheck.

00:29.821 --> 00:32.240
That's stupid.
I got to deposit mine.

00:32.323 --> 00:34.075
Just give me your PIN.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.577
Uh..

00:37.120 --> 00:38.204
You don't trust me?

00:38.288 --> 00:40.039
No, no.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.207
Of course I trust you.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.334
It's just..

00:43.418 --> 00:46.087
Okay, before I tell you my PIN

00:46.171 --> 00:47.338
you have to know

00:47.422 --> 00:48.882
that nobody has ever

00:48.965 --> 00:51.092
gotten inside my heart and soul

00:51.176 --> 00:52.218
the way you have.

00:52.302 --> 00:55.221
I love you <i> so much.</i>

00:55.305 --> 00:57.223
- Holly, what's the--
- Ben-4-ever.

00:58.683 --> 00:59.601
[sighs]

00:59.684 --> 01:02.145
Mmm, baby, it's cool.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.480
You had a life before me.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.482
- Aw, you're so--
- Change it.

01:05.565 --> 01:06.858
Done.

01:08.401 --> 01:11.488
So here's my paycheck
and save the receipt.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.907
Thanks.

Lauren, Lauren, Lauren!

02:15.718 --> 02:18.221
Oh, my God, it happened.
Vic and I--

02:18.304 --> 02:19.180
Holy crap!

02:19.264 --> 02:21.391
You and ham arms finally did it?

02:21.474 --> 02:24.269
No, we kissed.
And it was amazing.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.855
- Oh, my god, you kissed?
- Hm-mmm.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.523
How was the breath?

02:28.606 --> 02:32.610
Like a field of mint
with a touch of candied yam.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.112
Oh!

02:34.195 --> 02:36.114
So what happened after the kiss?

02:36.197 --> 02:37.866
He left.

02:37.949 --> 02:40.159
- He left?
- Yeah.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.786
He said that he wants to woo me

02:41.870 --> 02:44.539
so he's taking me out
on a date tonight.

02:44.622 --> 02:47.500
So, you guys are gonna woo
after your date?

02:47.584 --> 02:49.460
Okay, do you know what
the word "Woo" means?

02:49.544 --> 02:51.421
Yeah, it means
that Vic gets naked

02:51.504 --> 02:53.506
and then you go, woo.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.135
- Val, this came for you.
- Ooh!

02:57.218 --> 02:58.553
This must be one of the clues.

02:58.636 --> 02:59.846
Vic said he's gonna
send me clues

02:59.929 --> 03:02.599
about where
he's taking me tonight.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.143
Oh, look, it's a poem.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.520
"Time that keeps
dear love from me

03:07.604 --> 03:10.481
is but my lonely
heart's enemy."

03:10.565 --> 03:13.234
Is that the sweetest?

03:13.318 --> 03:15.904
What's he saying with that?

03:15.987 --> 03:18.781
Yeah, I think he's telling her
that he like-y the dudes.

03:18.865 --> 03:22.076
No, no, it's about time
and love and--

03:22.160 --> 03:24.579
Ooh! And, oh, look,
there's a watch.

03:24.662 --> 03:26.623
Oh, look.
It's stopped at 6:00.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.291
That must mean our date
is at 6:00.

03:28.374 --> 03:32.045
Yeah or your gay husband got
a good deal on a broken watch.

03:32.128 --> 03:35.840
Oh, Lauren, stop it.
This is Val's day, okay?

03:35.924 --> 03:37.884
After making out
with her ex-fiance

03:37.967 --> 03:41.054
you get no days for
the rest of your life, now!

03:41.137 --> 03:44.641
Oh, my God, I can't believe
that you are still harping on--

03:44.724 --> 03:46.643
Okay, you know what, Gary?
It's okay.

03:46.726 --> 03:49.228
Lauren and I
have moved past the fact

03:49.312 --> 03:52.482
that she betrayed me
and made out with my ex-fiance.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.400
Yeah, what about the fact
that she betrayed me?

03:54.484 --> 03:55.526
I told the woman not to go--

03:55.610 --> 03:56.819
Hey, when have I ever
listened to you?

03:56.903 --> 03:58.738
Hey, I'm a man,
I'm a player!

03:58.821 --> 04:00.865
Okay! Stop it!

04:00.949 --> 04:02.533
It's my day.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.412
Oh.

04:07.288 --> 04:08.498
Isn't Vic incredible?

04:08.581 --> 04:11.834
So sweet and thoughtful
and romantic.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.920
Yeah. Rick was romantic.

04:14.003 --> 04:17.257
Yeah, with you, with his wife,
Sara down the street.

04:17.339 --> 04:20.385
Okay! Gary, I said
it's over, alright?

04:20.468 --> 04:21.970
Let's not talk about it anymore.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.722
Let's just be happy that
that loser is out of her life.

04:24.806 --> 04:25.765
Excuse me?

04:25.848 --> 04:27.892
You heard right.

04:27.976 --> 04:31.562
Uh, w-what do you mean
by "Loser?"

04:31.646 --> 04:33.731
Well, Lauren, honey

04:33.815 --> 04:36.985
I mean this
in the most loving way.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.987
When someone is a cheat
and a liar

04:39.070 --> 04:40.238
it kinda makes them a loser.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.365
Okay, come on!
We have customers.

04:42.448 --> 04:45.493
Uh, okay, just because
he cheated and lied to you

04:45.576 --> 04:47.912
does not mean that he's going
to treat me the same way.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.872
Yeah, he's already treating you
the same way.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.791
He's cheating on you
with his wife.

04:51.874 --> 04:55.545
Yeah, but that's just 'cause
she doesn't like to get freaky.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.797
Come here.
Listen to me.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.549
Rick is never
gonna leave his wife.

04:59.632 --> 05:02.051
Uh, hey, what are you,
the God of Rick?

05:02.135 --> 05:03.261
You don't know that.

05:03.344 --> 05:04.512
Uh, I was engaged

05:04.595 --> 05:05.888
to the man, I think I know him.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.807
You don't know him
the way that I know him.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.183
Okay, look, he is gonna

05:09.267 --> 05:11.436
break your heart
just like he broke my heart

05:11.519 --> 05:13.062
just like he is breaking
his wife's heart

05:13.146 --> 05:14.981
just like he's gonna break
the next girl's heart.

05:15.064 --> 05:16.315
That's what he does.

05:16.399 --> 05:19.027
Rick is never gonna leave
his wife for you!

05:19.110 --> 05:23.614
Okay, now you're really
pissing me off, nasty.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.366
See, unlike the two of you

05:25.450 --> 05:27.577
Rick and I are on the same page.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.579
Oh, you mean, the same web page?

05:29.662 --> 05:30.747
Isn't that where you two started

05:30.830 --> 05:32.290
your deep and meaningful
relationship?

05:32.373 --> 05:33.791
Oh, yes, as opposed to

05:33.875 --> 05:36.377
your deep, meaningful
relationship with Vic?

05:36.461 --> 05:38.755
Hmm, now when did that start?
Let me think back.

05:38.838 --> 05:42.091
Oh, yes, the bottom
of a tequila bottle!

05:42.175 --> 05:44.010
That's just because
Rick cheated on me!

05:44.093 --> 05:45.636
And I don't blame him!

05:45.720 --> 05:46.971
(Valerie)
Mmm!

05:49.223 --> 05:53.061
Okay, let's all give it up
for the Sugar Babies players.

06:03.237 --> 06:05.073
[instrumental music]

06:07.742 --> 06:08.868
Hey, man, hey, hey.

06:08.951 --> 06:10.119
Can I talk to you
about something?

06:10.203 --> 06:11.829
It's, it's kind of embarrassing.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.498
Oh, say no more.

06:13.581 --> 06:15.792
Use the cream from the third
shelf in the medicine cabinet.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.376
It takes away everything.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.795
Gary, it's about Holly.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.171
Oh, tell Holly, "Use the cream

06:20.254 --> 06:21.297
from the third shelf in the--"

06:21.380 --> 06:23.424
Gary, it's not about that.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.302
I saw Holly's paycheck.
It's huge.

06:26.385 --> 06:27.720
I can't stop
thinking about it, man.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.931
She makes so much
more money than me.

06:30.014 --> 06:32.475
- And?
- And it bugs me.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.186
I mean, I'm the man.
I'm supposed to be the provider.

06:35.269 --> 06:36.979
No, no, you are the man

06:37.063 --> 06:38.940
because you found yourself
a rich girlfriend.

06:39.023 --> 06:40.358
High five.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.903
So it wouldn't bother you
that your girlfriend

06:43.986 --> 06:45.446
makes twice
as much money as you?

06:45.530 --> 06:48.783
Look, man, why make it a problem
when there is no problem?

06:48.866 --> 06:50.159
You love her. She loves you.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.536
- Yeah, but it bugs me that--
- Okay, okay.

06:51.619 --> 06:52.954
So you think
that Holly is so far

06:53.037 --> 06:54.497
beneath you
that she isn't entitled

06:54.580 --> 06:55.581
to making more money than you?

06:55.665 --> 06:56.791
No, it's just--

06:56.874 --> 06:58.042
Then she doesn't deserve
to make more money?

06:58.126 --> 06:59.043
No, she deserves--

06:59.127 --> 07:01.170
Then it's your stupid pride.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.464
Aw, that could be it.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.341
Now, what are you gonna do
about it?

07:05.424 --> 07:07.510
I'm gonna get past it,
try to get past it.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.721
No, you're gonna do it,
because real men get past it.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.348
And you're acting
like a weak man.

07:12.431 --> 07:13.891
Now, are you a real man?

07:13.975 --> 07:15.518
Raargh!

07:15.601 --> 07:18.354
Weird man, but real man.

07:18.437 --> 07:19.814
Thanks, Gary.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.235
Now, you know
you got to pay for that.

07:24.318 --> 07:26.028
Put it on Holly's tab.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.739
A real man can let his woman
pay for his muffin.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.117
That's what I'm talking about.
Keep it pimpin', player!

07:31.200 --> 07:34.203
Keep it pimpin', alright.
I wrote the book on macking.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.872
Hey, Val,
someone's here for you.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.123
(Valerie)
'Oh, ho!'

07:37.206 --> 07:39.208
'Lauren, did you
come to apologize'

07:39.292 --> 07:40.751
finally see the error of..

07:40.835 --> 07:42.670
Oh, flowers, hm-mmm.

07:44.046 --> 07:45.047
Here.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.008
Clue number two.

07:47.091 --> 07:50.136
See, Gary,
Lauren needs to understand

07:50.219 --> 07:51.846
what a real relationship
is about.

07:51.929 --> 07:53.723
A relationship with a man

07:53.806 --> 07:55.725
who is not a liar and a cheat.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.728
A man who can put these flowers
on his MasterCard

07:58.811 --> 08:01.772
and not worry that his wife
is gonna find out about it.

08:03.774 --> 08:06.903
"Dear Lauren, I've left my wife.
Love, Rick."

08:06.986 --> 08:09.030
My mistake.
Not your clue.

08:10.531 --> 08:13.034
[instrumental music]

08:15.494 --> 08:17.455
[knock on door]

08:17.538 --> 08:18.706
Coming.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.251
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.837
So I got your text message.
What's the emergency?

08:24.921 --> 08:28.007
You need your man
for something?

08:28.090 --> 08:30.760
Lift something heavy,
kill a bug, ride a bull?

08:30.843 --> 08:32.636
I'm your man.

08:32.720 --> 08:36.474
Yeah, later. First, I want you
to open your present.

08:36.557 --> 08:37.892
Merry Christmas!

08:37.975 --> 08:40.394
I know it's early
but I couldn't wait. Come on.

08:40.477 --> 08:41.687
Why can't we just
wait till Christmas?

08:41.770 --> 08:43.022
Because I'm too excited

08:43.105 --> 08:44.690
and you have no idea
how hard it was for me

08:44.774 --> 08:47.568
to keep this trip
to the Caribbean a secret.

08:47.652 --> 08:48.945
Oops.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.196
See?

08:51.697 --> 08:52.698
You bought me a trip?

08:52.782 --> 08:54.825
I bought us a trip.

08:56.118 --> 08:58.996
Four days, blues skies,
golden sands.

08:59.080 --> 09:03.501
That's, uh...that's very
generous of you.

09:03.584 --> 09:04.794
Raargh.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.130
Anything for my baby.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.716
Ah! Wait till you see
the hotel I got.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.302
It was completely booked, so
I schmeared the guy a little bit

09:13.386 --> 09:16.764
and I got us this great deal
on a room with an ocean view.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.226
Who's the man?

09:23.229 --> 09:26.274
I can't go. I-I can't take
four days off of work.

09:26.357 --> 09:27.316
Wait. What?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.401
Well, part of it's a weekend

09:28.484 --> 09:29.485
so it's really only two days.

09:29.568 --> 09:30.945
I-I just can't pick up
and leave.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.488
Well, it's two days.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.408
Last year you took off an entire
day to see "The Incredibles."

09:37.451 --> 09:38.411
I'm not going.

09:38.494 --> 09:40.663
Wait. What?
Yes, you are.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.665
Don't tell me
what I'm gonna do.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.875
Okay, fine. Don't go.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.836
- Merry Christmas, weirdo.
- Same to you.

09:46.919 --> 09:50.089
Well, sucks for you
because it's the luxury resort

09:50.172 --> 09:52.550
where Britney and Kevin
got married!

09:52.633 --> 09:55.136
[instrumental music]

10:01.058 --> 10:02.101
I can't do it, Gary.

10:02.184 --> 10:03.352
I tried to be cool

10:03.436 --> 10:06.355
but I cannot be a kept man.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.482
You ain't trying hard enough.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.193
I don't understand him, Tina.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.612
I gave him the trip
and he totally freaked out.

10:13.696 --> 10:16.699
I hate him so much right now,
but I don't know why.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.744
I may be able to help you.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.329
Hold, please.

10:21.412 --> 10:22.997
(Vince)
'I got to make
more money, Gary.'

10:23.080 --> 10:25.541
I, uh, Holly is just gonna
keep making more and more.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.587
I'm telling you,
she's going places.

10:29.670 --> 10:32.840
And I'm just going to those
places to deliver packages.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.094
Relax, man. Alright?

10:37.178 --> 10:40.556
There are many ways for you
to make some serious cash.

10:40.639 --> 10:42.767
Two words.
Sell your kidney.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.062
I feel like such a loser.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.313
I mean, what kind of job
can I get

10:47.396 --> 10:49.231
to even come close
to what she has?

10:49.315 --> 10:51.650
(Gary)
'Um, I don't know, let's think
about it for a second.'

10:51.734 --> 10:53.361
You've never worked
in an office.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.696
You don't have any experience.

10:55.780 --> 11:00.076
Um...you know what
I can see you doing?

11:00.159 --> 11:01.702
Selling real estate.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.748
(Vince)
'Real estate?
I don't know anything about--'

11:05.831 --> 11:07.750
Look, man, the key
to New York real estate

11:07.833 --> 11:09.043
is inside information.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.920
And who knows the city
better than you?

11:11.003 --> 11:14.507
You've delivered to every
doorman in every building.

11:14.590 --> 11:17.176
I do know what's going down
on the streets.

11:19.804 --> 11:24.225
Dude...I am so
a real estate agent.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.820
[instrumental music]

11:39.907 --> 11:41.534
Oh, Gary.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.661
I have looked everywhere.
There's no sign of Lauren.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.204
Why did I have to open
my big mouth?

11:45.287 --> 11:48.457
Why is everyone
coming to me today?

11:48.541 --> 11:51.460
I am tired of trying to help
everybody with their problems.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.004
I tried to help Vince,
I tried to help..

11:54.088 --> 11:56.799
Wait, who else did I
try to help?

11:56.882 --> 11:58.092
Just me.

11:58.175 --> 12:00.177
Oh. Well, how can I help you?

12:01.220 --> 12:02.763
Gary, I am a horrible friend.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.223
I said some horrible things

12:04.306 --> 12:06.934
and the horrible things
I said are all wrong.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.018
Yeah, but you're the man, see

12:08.102 --> 12:10.146
and you make more money
than her.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.315
- What?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.025
I'm getting my clients
all mixed up.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.902
Uh, let's see.
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.988
You're the one with
the second clue to your date.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.739
Oh.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.408
Isn't he precious?

12:22.491 --> 12:24.535
Yeah, it's not often
you see a teddy bear

12:24.618 --> 12:27.204
in his formal attire.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.790
It must mean Vic's taking me
someplace fancy.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.334
Where do you think she could be?

12:32.418 --> 12:34.044
Who?

12:34.128 --> 12:35.546
Lauren!

12:35.629 --> 12:38.215
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Uh, she's at the Fashion Corner.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.593
She called a while ago.

12:40.676 --> 12:45.139
Uh-oh. I-I think I sent..
Oh, well.

12:45.222 --> 12:48.058
I hope Vince finds something
cute when he gets there.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.561
[instrumental music]

13:01.697 --> 13:03.824
She's been in here
for, like, two hours.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.826
She tried to have
some wonton soup delivered

13:05.910 --> 13:07.745
but we have a strict
"No food" policy.

13:07.828 --> 13:09.663
Yeah, you wouldn't know it
by the cows I've seen

13:09.747 --> 13:11.332
parading through here.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.421
Lauren?

13:17.505 --> 13:18.464
Hmm.

13:18.547 --> 13:21.342
What are you doing here?

13:21.425 --> 13:24.595
Finding you to apologize.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.722
I'm so sorry
for the things I said.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.807
Oh, I'm sorry too.

13:30.976 --> 13:34.688
Hey, um...why do you think it is

13:34.772 --> 13:36.941
that every time I find
a guy I like

13:37.024 --> 13:38.442
there's always some "But."

13:38.526 --> 13:40.528
You know, he's cute,
but he's gotta get back

13:40.611 --> 13:42.738
to the psych unit before 6:00.

13:42.821 --> 13:44.949
He's super smart,
but he's a flasher.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.867
And now Rick.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.994
You know, I thought that
we could have been soulmates

13:49.078 --> 13:51.288
but he's married.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.582
Yeah, about that

13:53.666 --> 13:57.628
this came for you
with a dozen roses.

13:57.711 --> 14:01.257
Oh, my God.
He left his wife?

14:01.340 --> 14:03.092
That's what it says.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.593
So I was right.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.345
And I was wrong.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.430
And, you know, I've been
thinking about it.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.850
Whatever you wanna do,
I am there for you, okay?

14:11.934 --> 14:14.770
I don't ever wanna let Rick
ruin our friendship.

14:14.853 --> 14:18.274
Oh, sweetie, he never will.

14:18.357 --> 14:21.860
Uh, Val?
Can I ask you a question?

14:21.944 --> 14:23.612
Anything.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.197
Does this beret
make me look French

14:25.281 --> 14:27.324
or like I work at La Crepe?

14:28.701 --> 14:30.911
Mostly, it just
makes you look stupid.

14:33.455 --> 14:35.249
See? We're friends.

14:35.332 --> 14:36.375
I can say that.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.919
Yeah.
Your hair looks flat.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.255
Oh!

14:41.338 --> 14:42.590
[both giggle]

14:42.673 --> 14:45.092
You know what?
Maybe I just misjudged him.

14:45.175 --> 14:48.220
You know, maybe truly
being in love with someone

14:48.304 --> 14:49.430
can change a person.

14:49.513 --> 14:50.598
Yeah, I mean look how

14:50.681 --> 14:52.308
being in love with Vic
has changed you.

14:52.391 --> 14:53.809
Yeah, and I never
would have gotten there

14:53.892 --> 14:56.270
if I didn't have a friend
like you to help me.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.022
Aw.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.898
I'm so great.

15:00.941 --> 15:03.110
Yes, you are.
You're terrific.

15:04.486 --> 15:07.698
Okay, um, Val, there's something
that I should prob--

15:07.781 --> 15:11.076
Ladies, can I ring
any of that up for you?

15:11.160 --> 15:13.746
- No.
- Then we're closed. Get out.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.874
Closed? Oh, my God,
what time is it?

15:16.957 --> 15:18.667
Ohh! Oh, no.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.377
I don't even know where
I'm supposed to meet Vic.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.421
He said he was gonna leave
another clue at the bakery.

15:22.504 --> 15:23.505
Where's my cell?
Where's my cell?

15:23.589 --> 15:24.798
Here-here, use mine.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.967
Okay. Oh, okay.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.137
- Quit.
- Okay, sorry.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.388
Oh. Oh, God.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.849
H-he-he says
that he waited 45 minutes

15:33.932 --> 15:35.309
at the restaurant
and then he left

15:35.392 --> 15:36.894
because he thought that
I got scared and backed out.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.312
No, no, no.
You didn't back out.

15:38.395 --> 15:39.355
No, I didn't back out!

15:39.438 --> 15:40.397
I came here to find you.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.650
Oh, I'm sorry!
I'm really sorry!

15:42.733 --> 15:44.777
[alarm blaring]

15:50.407 --> 15:52.034
[instrumental music]

15:54.620 --> 15:56.080
[knock on door]

15:56.955 --> 15:58.457
Coming.

16:00.501 --> 16:03.087
Hi. I am so glad you came.

16:03.170 --> 16:06.590
I have been calling you
and calling you..

16:06.674 --> 16:09.635
Oh. Tha-that's not
a loving look.

16:09.718 --> 16:11.136
[chuckles]

16:11.220 --> 16:12.513
So, funny thing.

16:12.596 --> 16:14.973
Yeah, I was out all day

16:15.057 --> 16:16.975
trying to find a new job.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.602
What? You're looking
for a new job?

16:18.686 --> 16:20.229
- I thought you loved your--
- Holly?

16:20.312 --> 16:22.314
Continue.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.233
So I got a call
for an interview

16:24.316 --> 16:26.068
with a really huge
real estate firm.

16:26.151 --> 16:29.321
That's so fast-paced
and exciting.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.572
Real fast-paced.

16:30.656 --> 16:31.907
So fast-paced, in fact

16:31.990 --> 16:33.242
they called me in
for an interview

16:33.325 --> 16:34.993
based on an impressive resume

16:35.077 --> 16:36.245
I didn't send them.

16:36.328 --> 16:37.913
That is awesome.

16:39.456 --> 16:40.416
You're unbelievable.

16:40.499 --> 16:41.750
You made me a resume

16:41.834 --> 16:43.502
and sent it over
without even asking?

16:43.585 --> 16:46.672
Vince, I just didn't want
you pounding the pavement

16:46.755 --> 16:48.090
'cause it's not how you do it.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.675
No, it's not how <i> you</i> do it.

16:49.758 --> 16:51.427
Holly, I can get
my own interviews.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.220
No. Why won't you just
let me help you?

16:53.303 --> 16:55.848
No, Holly, I've been
taking care of myself

16:55.931 --> 16:56.932
since I was 17 years old.

16:57.015 --> 16:58.809
I know, but

16:58.892 --> 17:00.686
if I have experience
in something--

17:00.769 --> 17:01.937
No. Baby, no.

17:02.020 --> 17:03.397
[sighs]

17:03.480 --> 17:07.651
Holly, I wanna be the one
who takes care of you.

17:07.734 --> 17:10.779
I wanna be the one that buys
tickets to the Caribbean.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.031
I wanna be Britney Spears.

17:16.910 --> 17:19.038
Okay, but what's the difference

17:19.121 --> 17:22.290
if we're both going
to the Caribbean together?

17:22.374 --> 17:24.626
I don't know. It's just..

17:24.710 --> 17:26.545
It's just different.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.591
You do take care of me.

17:30.674 --> 17:31.967
Oh, yeah?

17:32.050 --> 17:33.844
How do I take care of you?

17:33.927 --> 17:35.471
You love me.

17:35.554 --> 17:39.016
And...you go
to the Caribbean with me.

17:41.852 --> 17:44.521
Only if I pay for the next trip.

17:44.605 --> 17:45.773
Okay.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.153
And...if I were you

17:51.236 --> 17:52.863
I would go with
the gray pinstripe suit

17:52.946 --> 17:55.491
for the interview.

17:55.574 --> 17:58.076
Holly, I can pick out
my own clothes.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.747
Good call on the gray pinstripe.

18:01.830 --> 18:04.917
Hey, look, it's the program
from my high school graduation.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.376
Huh!

18:06.460 --> 18:09.421
Vince, your interview's
gonna go great.

18:09.505 --> 18:13.675
You're gonna be charming,
funny, smart, sexy.

18:13.759 --> 18:14.927
(Robin)
'Vince!'

18:16.428 --> 18:18.096
- Robin?
- Vince!

18:18.180 --> 18:19.598
I was just so excited

18:19.681 --> 18:21.433
when your resume
came through the fax.

18:21.517 --> 18:22.893
I pulled it immediately
and got you

18:22.976 --> 18:25.979
an interview with daddy
before he left town.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.689
[laughs]

18:27.773 --> 18:29.608
Oh, I hope you don't mind.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.610
I got your address
off your resume.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.028
I just wanted
to give you a heads-up

18:33.111 --> 18:34.363
before you meet with daddy.

18:34.446 --> 18:37.157
Robin, wow. Robin?

18:37.991 --> 18:38.951
I didn't know you were..

18:39.034 --> 18:40.369
Holly, this is Robin.

18:40.452 --> 18:41.703
Yes, I gathered.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.164
- Robin Marquette.
- I'm Holly Tyler. I'm Vince's--

18:44.248 --> 18:48.126
Wow. So Marquette Properties
is your--

18:48.210 --> 18:49.086
Daddy's company.

18:49.169 --> 18:50.379
That little parking lot business

18:50.462 --> 18:51.588
he started when
we were in high school

18:51.672 --> 18:52.548
really took off.

18:52.631 --> 18:53.966
We went to high school together.

18:54.049 --> 18:56.593
Oh. So are you in the program?

18:56.677 --> 18:58.846
If those parking lots
could talk, huh, Vince?

19:00.430 --> 19:02.599
But they can't.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.518
Pavement.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.311
When I went off
to Sarah Lawrence

19:06.395 --> 19:08.897
I totally lost touch
with this guy.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.524
You know how it is
when you go to college.

19:10.607 --> 19:14.153
Yeah, I know, totally.
Yeah, I graduated comma sum..

19:14.236 --> 19:15.737
You know, whatever.

19:17.155 --> 19:19.199
Can you believe
this coincidence?

19:19.283 --> 19:21.660
No. I mean, it's unbelievable.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.204
Come on.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.831
I've got the company limo.

19:25.914 --> 19:28.584
My God, how is it
you look even better

19:28.667 --> 19:30.669
than you did four years ago?

19:30.752 --> 19:32.754
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, back at ya.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.215
- I'll call you.
- Okay. Yeah.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.925
Knock 'em dead.

19:38.218 --> 19:39.303
[stomps foot]

19:39.386 --> 19:40.846
I am not pleased.

19:40.929 --> 19:43.432
[instrumental music]

19:47.853 --> 19:50.272
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.190
You missed your date
because of me.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.526
Oh, the traffic out there
was so bad.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.153
Maybe the President is in town.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.405
He's always making
a mess of everything.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.741
Damn. No messages.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.117
[indistinct chatter on TV]

20:02.201 --> 20:03.285
Oh, okay.
Here's what it was.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.704
Look, Val,
there's a huge fire in Soho.

20:05.787 --> 20:10.042
[gasps]
Oh, please, dear God,
don't let it be the DKNY store.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.211
(man on TV)
'Additional units
from Spring, Jones'

20:12.294 --> 20:15.130
'and Duane Street stations
were called in to help out.'

20:15.213 --> 20:17.299
Duane Street. Oh, my God.
T-that's Vic's station.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.718
'We've just been informed
that three firefighters'

20:19.801 --> 20:22.638
'have been seriously injured
in a roof collapse.'

20:22.721 --> 20:25.307
Okay, uh, Val,
I am sure that right now

20:25.390 --> 20:26.767
Vic is into his third martini

20:26.850 --> 20:29.269
telling the bartender
what a freak his wife is, okay?

20:30.062 --> 20:31.021
[telephone rings]

20:31.104 --> 20:32.064
Look, that's probably him

20:32.147 --> 20:33.190
right now, drunk dialing.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.109
Hello?

20:37.903 --> 20:39.071
It's the fire department.

20:39.154 --> 20:40.489
[dramatic music]

20:40.572 --> 20:43.450
Yes, this is Mrs. Meladeo.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.995
Oh, God.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.713
[theme music]
