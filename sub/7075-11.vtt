WEBVTT

00:01.915 --> 00:04.925
It's that very special time of year,
Greendale.

00:04.926 --> 00:06.646
A time for me to remind you

00:06.647 --> 00:09.372
that your school acknowledges
no specialness

00:09.373 --> 00:10.847
to this time of year.

00:10.883 --> 00:13.395
You do, of course, have
a constitutional right

00:13.396 --> 00:14.740
to lend this season

00:14.741 --> 00:16.152
the significance of your choosing

00:16.152 --> 00:18.958
in any of our designated holiday zones.

00:21.460 --> 00:22.631
Merry Christmas, everybody.

00:22.632 --> 00:24.472
Don't you mean season's greetings?

00:24.473 --> 00:25.985
Come on, Shirley. You know it's Christmas.

00:25.986 --> 00:27.562
Yes, but as a modern Christian,

00:27.563 --> 00:28.795
I've learned to be sensitive

00:28.796 --> 00:30.294
to other cultures' jealousies.

00:30.295 --> 00:31.461
So what are we doing this year?

00:31.462 --> 00:33.252
Well, I'm taking a relaxation course

00:33.253 --> 00:34.234
next semester.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.285
And I was going to use the break

00:35.286 --> 00:36.637
to do all the reading in advance.

00:36.638 --> 00:38.696
I'm shutting myself in with my video games.

00:38.751 --> 00:40.382
Fake-murdering people is gonna be

00:40.383 --> 00:42.046
my new holiday tradition.

00:42.532 --> 00:43.756
Hm. This is disappointing.

00:43.757 --> 00:45.286
What do you care about Christmas, Abed?

00:45.287 --> 00:46.009
You're Muslim.

00:46.010 --> 00:47.102
Don't your people spend this season

00:47.103 --> 00:48.889
writing angry letters to TV guide?

00:48.890 --> 00:50.628
It's true. Religiously, I'm Muslim.

00:50.629 --> 00:52.303
But I've always been a big fan
of Christmas.

00:52.304 --> 00:53.806
And this is the most important Christmas

00:53.807 --> 00:55.354
in the history of the universe.

00:55.355 --> 00:57.491
I'm assuming that's why we're all
stop-motion animated.

00:59.408 --> 01:00.783
I vote we let it go.

01:00.791 --> 01:02.283
What did you say we were, Abed?

01:02.284 --> 01:03.356
We're stop-motion animated.

01:03.357 --> 01:04.677
I don't understand what he's saying.

01:04.678 --> 01:06.454
I never understand what
any of you are saying.

01:06.455 --> 01:07.439
You guys don't see it?

01:07.440 --> 01:08.784
I noticed it this morning.

01:08.804 --> 01:10.441
That's how I knew it was
a special Christmas.

01:10.442 --> 01:12.049
We've clearly entered a whole new medium.

01:12.050 --> 01:14.012
Abed, does the word clearly
mean the same thing

01:14.013 --> 01:15.831
to you as it does to normal people?

01:15.832 --> 01:17.799
It's probably Arabic for "not clearly."

01:18.706 --> 01:20.610
You really expect me to tarnish
the high five

01:20.611 --> 01:21.765
for that?

01:22.050 --> 01:23.776
You guys really don't see what I'm seeing?

01:24.566 --> 01:25.944
That worries me a little.

01:25.945 --> 01:27.629
I think it worries all of us.

01:27.630 --> 01:29.203
Is there something that we can do

01:29.204 --> 01:32.551
to help you with your situation, Abed?

01:32.552 --> 01:34.093
For starters, you could move around more.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.144
Not much point in being animated

01:35.145 --> 01:35.962
if you don't.

01:35.963 --> 01:37.405
And I think we should commit to the format.

01:37.555 --> 01:39.085
Starting with a song.

01:40.539 --> 01:42.791
You start. I'm sure we'll join in.

01:43.457 --> 01:45.016
* Give me the snow

01:45.017 --> 01:46.656
light up the trees

01:46.666 --> 01:48.222
deck every hall

01:48.234 --> 01:49.864
and while you can see

01:49.946 --> 01:51.629
roast every nut

01:51.712 --> 01:53.236
mistle the toe

01:53.237 --> 01:55.358
this needs to be the best Christmas

01:55.359 --> 01:57.240
since the original.

01:57.241 --> 02:00.478
20,000 years from now

02:00.479 --> 02:02.155
they'll say

02:02.324 --> 02:04.946
the most successful Christmas

02:04.947 --> 02:07.435
was today. *

02:08.733 --> 02:10.139
Okay, we got him.

02:10.140 --> 02:11.645
We got him. He's down.

02:11.942 --> 02:14.695
Now, how many fingers am I holding up?

02:14.696 --> 02:16.018
And, more importantly,

02:16.019 --> 02:17.854
are they still made of clay?

02:17.855 --> 02:19.279
Three, and I told you, we're not clay.

02:19.280 --> 02:20.665
We're silicone dolls with foam bodies

02:20.666 --> 02:22.043
over ball-and-socket armatures.

02:22.044 --> 02:23.312
Fascinating.

02:23.568 --> 02:24.749
And publishable.

02:24.750 --> 02:26.350
And you say you have no memory

02:26.351 --> 02:27.262
of this morning.

02:27.263 --> 02:29.239
You don't recall the emotional crisis

02:29.240 --> 02:30.577
that caused you to take shelter

02:30.578 --> 02:31.670
in this delusion.

02:31.671 --> 02:34.544
- It's not a delusion.
- Very, very publishable.

02:34.568 --> 02:36.853
Abed, I've been a professor of psychology

02:36.854 --> 02:39.409
here at Greendale for many years.

02:39.410 --> 02:41.174
And I think I see a solution to this

02:41.175 --> 02:44.344
that might also help you
with your situation.

02:44.345 --> 02:46.455
I'd like to do extensive sessions with you,

02:46.456 --> 02:47.851
including hypnosis.

02:47.852 --> 02:49.882
- I don't need therapy.
- Nobody said you did.

02:49.883 --> 02:51.703
I just think it would benefit you

02:51.704 --> 02:54.015
and, incidentally, me,

02:54.016 --> 02:56.484
to get to the real meaning of all this.

02:56.485 --> 02:57.878
You're right. That's it.

02:57.879 --> 02:59.391
I need to find the meaning of Christmas.

02:59.392 --> 03:00.339
Ah, well...

03:00.340 --> 03:01.402
If I can find the meaning of Christmas,

03:01.403 --> 03:02.909
everything will go back to normal.

03:02.939 --> 03:03.838
Asterisk.

03:03.839 --> 03:05.077
Abed, the dean says

03:05.078 --> 03:06.278
if you don't get help,

03:06.279 --> 03:08.226
they might kick you out of school.

03:08.227 --> 03:09.259
Why would I want to be in a school

03:09.260 --> 03:10.702
that hates Christmas?

03:11.769 --> 03:12.940
He's got a point.

03:12.941 --> 03:14.072
Kidding.

03:14.121 --> 03:16.929
* Sad quick Christmas song

03:17.122 --> 03:20.105
sad quick Christmas snowman

03:20.106 --> 03:22.858
tragic day gone wrong

03:22.931 --> 03:26.069
sad quick Christmas song. *

03:26.295 --> 03:27.702
I don't suppose you know
the meaning of Christmas,

03:27.703 --> 03:28.863
lonely snowman.

03:28.864 --> 03:30.414
Apparently, it means getting fondled

03:30.415 --> 03:31.969
by singing mental cases.

03:31.970 --> 03:33.363
My snowman is alive!

03:33.364 --> 03:34.581
I'm not a snowman.

03:34.582 --> 03:35.715
I'm Chang.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.305
What the hell's wrong with you today?

03:37.306 --> 03:38.238
I thought I made you.

03:38.239 --> 03:39.590
Yeah, you made me need to cry

03:39.591 --> 03:41.018
in the shower tonight.

03:41.842 --> 03:42.961
It's a text from Britta.

03:42.962 --> 03:44.243
She says, "the meaning of Christmas

03:44.244 --> 03:45.732
is in the study room."

03:46.058 --> 03:47.667
Hey, now that you started it,

03:47.668 --> 03:50.391
how 'bout ten more seconds
on that third button, huh?

03:54.602 --> 03:56.755
You lied to lure me into
a group therapy session?

03:56.756 --> 03:57.679
Surprise!

03:57.680 --> 03:59.768
Pierce, you promised not to do that.

03:59.812 --> 04:00.946
Surprise.

04:00.947 --> 04:02.503
- Not cool.
- H-h-hold on, Abed.

04:02.504 --> 04:04.130
I'm not just a psych professor.

04:04.131 --> 04:07.372
I'm also a Christmas wizard.

04:07.373 --> 04:08.003
You are?

04:08.004 --> 04:08.796
I am.

04:08.797 --> 04:12.577
And I can help you find
the meaning of Christmas.

04:12.578 --> 04:13.436
Right, guys?

04:13.437 --> 04:15.093
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah.

04:15.152 --> 04:16.541
Oh, this feels safe.

04:16.543 --> 04:17.672
Shut up, Winger.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.654
What do you think, Abed?

04:19.654 --> 04:21.644
Christmas wizard. Hm.

04:22.874 --> 04:23.963
I guess I can see that.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.222
Have a seat, then.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.844
Nothing to be afraid of.

04:26.845 --> 04:28.286
All your friends are here.

04:28.287 --> 04:30.384
They just want to help.

04:30.936 --> 04:32.280
I'm here for the cookies.

04:32.281 --> 04:33.245
So what do we do?

04:33.246 --> 04:34.261
Well, with your permission,

04:34.262 --> 04:35.603
I'd like to put you into a state

04:35.604 --> 04:38.408
of christmasnosis

04:38.409 --> 04:41.094
and take you on a magic journey.

04:41.095 --> 04:42.087
To winter wonderland?

04:42.088 --> 04:42.949
Sure.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.292
Your own personal winter wonderland.

04:45.293 --> 04:46.507
Come on, everyone.

04:46.508 --> 04:49.027
You all know how magic
Christmas journeys work.

04:49.028 --> 04:50.073
Mm-hmm.

04:50.074 --> 04:51.696
You are playing with so much fire.

04:51.697 --> 04:52.916
Shut up, Winger.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.434
Hands on the table.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.949
Eyes closed.

04:55.967 --> 04:57.210
Heads relaxing.

04:57.216 --> 04:58.626
Necks relaxing.

04:58.627 --> 05:00.720
Don't relax Pierce any lower.

05:00.721 --> 05:01.586
Screw you.

05:01.587 --> 05:04.317
Abed, focus on the sound of my voice,

05:04.318 --> 05:06.336
and let yourself relax.

05:06.337 --> 05:08.331
With each breath, you'll feel...

05:08.332 --> 05:09.651
- It's beginning.
- All right, then.

05:09.652 --> 05:10.532
The table's moving.

05:10.533 --> 05:12.556
Shaking like a rocket about to take off.

05:12.573 --> 05:13.856
Now it's leaving the floor

05:13.857 --> 05:15.320
as the walls and the ceiling fly away.

05:15.884 --> 05:18.024
We're in outer Christmas space.

05:18.177 --> 05:19.483
There's planet holly.

05:19.567 --> 05:20.927
And planet jolly.

05:21.258 --> 05:23.291
Oh, and what's that up ahead?

05:23.292 --> 05:25.407
Ah, it's planet Abed.

05:25.408 --> 05:26.039
Subtle.

05:26.040 --> 05:26.948
Yeah, we're actually descending

05:26.949 --> 05:28.074
onto planet Abed now.

05:28.075 --> 05:30.064
It's the most christmassy planet
in the universe.

05:30.065 --> 05:31.911
Its atmosphere is 7% cinnamon.

05:31.917 --> 05:33.178
Awww.

05:37.382 --> 05:39.176
We're here. Winter wonderland.

05:39.177 --> 05:40.129
See how sparkly?

05:40.130 --> 05:41.787
What, are you crazy?
All I see is the study...

05:41.788 --> 05:43.824
Ooh, sparkly wonderland.

05:43.825 --> 05:45.209
You might notice that during our journey,

05:45.210 --> 05:46.697
you've transformed into Christmas versions

05:46.698 --> 05:47.743
of yourselves.

05:47.744 --> 05:48.946
Jeff-in-the-box.

05:51.254 --> 05:52.222
Uh-huh.

05:52.223 --> 05:53.375
Troy soldier.

05:53.774 --> 05:55.493
Cool! Do I have a gun?

05:55.494 --> 05:57.152
- You have a drum.
- Cool.

05:57.153 --> 05:58.697
Britta, you're Britta-bot.

05:58.748 --> 05:59.999
- Uh...
- Just go with it.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.381
Bleep, bloop.

06:01.382 --> 06:02.559
Teddy Pierce.

06:03.245 --> 06:04.867
Bleep, bloop for me, too.

06:04.868 --> 06:06.066
Ballerannie.

06:06.655 --> 06:07.413
Oh.

06:07.414 --> 06:08.737
Baby doll Shirley.

06:09.143 --> 06:10.918
Baby what? What the hell?

06:11.296 --> 06:13.339
Well, we are making fabulous

06:13.340 --> 06:15.830
and unexpectedly intense progress.

06:15.831 --> 06:17.093
Now, what I'd like to do

06:17.094 --> 06:21.496
is visit the cave of frozen memories.

06:21.497 --> 06:22.996
Pass. Let's head for the north pole.

06:22.997 --> 06:24.629
The meaning of Christmas will be there.

06:24.659 --> 06:26.205
Um, well, yeah.

06:26.206 --> 06:27.312
Yeah, sure. Cheers.

06:27.313 --> 06:29.340
And I actually think I know a shortcut

06:29.341 --> 06:30.348
to the north pole

06:30.349 --> 06:33.083
through the cave of frozen memor...

06:33.084 --> 06:34.231
Fine, I guess we can take gumdrop road

06:34.232 --> 06:35.801
through Carol Canyon 
and stop at the cave.

06:35.802 --> 06:36.930
I wouldn't call it a shortcut,

06:36.931 --> 06:38.870
but you got us here,
so I'll throw you a bone.

06:39.430 --> 06:40.622
* Come with me

06:40.623 --> 06:41.888
and walk with me

06:41.889 --> 06:44.086
and see what we can find.

06:44.373 --> 06:45.530
* Accompany me

06:45.531 --> 06:46.970
on a journey with me

06:46.971 --> 06:49.049
through the wonderland

06:49.050 --> 06:51.603
in my mind. *

06:52.413 --> 06:53.547
Let's move, folks.

06:53.548 --> 06:56.483
This isn't going to be fun, easy, or safe.

07:02.111 --> 07:03.231
Shut up, Winger.

07:03.232 --> 07:04.463
Mm-hmm.

07:10.455 --> 07:11.401
Fair warning, guys.

07:11.402 --> 07:12.481
A journey through winter wonderland

07:12.482 --> 07:14.256
tends to test your commitment to Christmas.

07:14.257 --> 07:16.222
And when I say test, I mean wonka style.

07:16.223 --> 07:17.524
I'm talkin' dark.

07:17.640 --> 07:19.933
Stay honest, stay alert,

07:19.934 --> 07:21.291
and for the love of God,

07:21.292 --> 07:22.867
stay between the gumdrops.

07:23.495 --> 07:25.063
Look up there, Abed.

07:25.064 --> 07:28.957
I think I see the cave of frozen memories.

07:28.958 --> 07:30.066
A great place...

07:30.067 --> 07:31.431
It's actually the cave of frozen peas.

07:31.432 --> 07:32.581
It's a common mistake.

07:32.582 --> 07:33.686
Don't worry, Christmas wizard.

07:33.687 --> 07:34.533
I got this.

07:34.534 --> 07:35.573
Terrific.

07:37.536 --> 07:39.998
Abed, did you say my Christmas self

07:39.999 --> 07:41.047
was a baby?

07:41.048 --> 07:43.558
Are you sure you didn't say
I was a Christmas angel?

07:43.559 --> 07:44.943
I think that must be what you said, right?

07:44.944 --> 07:45.865
Because you respect me too much

07:45.866 --> 07:46.812
to imagine me as a baby.

07:46.813 --> 07:48.916
Jeez, maybe if you cry enough,
he'll change you.

07:48.917 --> 07:50.937
Uh, you do know why he said
you were a robot, right?

07:50.938 --> 07:52.814
Because I'm progressive and kick ass.

07:52.815 --> 07:54.385
How 'bout heartless and godless?

07:54.386 --> 07:56.201
I think he just gave us random identities,

07:56.202 --> 07:56.886
you guys.

07:56.887 --> 07:58.607
I mean, me, a ballerina?

07:58.608 --> 08:01.614
It's not like I'm that thin and graceful.

08:01.615 --> 08:02.440
Right?

08:02.441 --> 08:05.846
Annie, it's because you're fragile
and tightly wound.

08:07.061 --> 08:07.866
Oh!

08:07.867 --> 08:09.489
Ladies, cut the non-thematic chatter,

08:09.490 --> 08:10.896
and keep your eyes on the prize.

08:10.992 --> 08:12.446
We're looking for the meaning of Christmas.

08:12.447 --> 08:13.575
Uh, you know what, Abed?

08:13.576 --> 08:15.103
I happen to know the meaning of Christmas.

08:15.104 --> 08:16.943
And I'm pretty sure I'm the only one
here that does.

08:16.944 --> 08:19.068
So I would appreciate
a certain level of respect,

08:19.069 --> 08:20.002
even if I am a guest

08:20.003 --> 08:21.663
in your make-believe therapy wonderland.

08:21.664 --> 08:23.028
- Therapy?
- All right!

08:23.029 --> 08:25.760
I am freezing Shirley with my wand.

08:26.311 --> 08:29.205
And I am ejecting her from planet Abed

08:29.206 --> 08:34.933
with a remote control
Christmas pterodactyl.

08:35.977 --> 08:38.114
- Oh, nice.
- Now we're talking.

08:39.991 --> 08:41.690
The point being, if you're not interested

08:41.691 --> 08:42.590
in helping Abed,

08:42.591 --> 08:44.249
there's no reason to be here.

08:45.244 --> 08:46.350
Cookies.

08:47.989 --> 08:50.275
* Swaddled in her diaper

08:50.291 --> 08:52.291
high upon her throne

08:52.338 --> 08:54.356
the queen of Christmas babies

08:54.357 --> 08:57.990
thought that Christmas was her own. *

08:59.107 --> 09:01.224
That's wonderful.

09:01.225 --> 09:02.598
Let's get back to the magic journey

09:02.599 --> 09:03.382
and wrap up.

09:03.383 --> 09:04.782
Some of us have women to sleep with.

09:04.783 --> 09:05.888
You guys hear that?

09:06.128 --> 09:07.175
Humbugs.

09:07.176 --> 09:09.462
- Humbugs?
- Yeah, a whole swarm of them.

09:09.463 --> 09:10.410
See?

09:12.923 --> 09:14.376
Everyone stay perfectly sincere.

09:14.377 --> 09:16.091
Humbugs are attracted to sarcasm.

09:16.092 --> 09:16.844
Wow.

09:16.845 --> 09:18.670
Somewhere out there,
Tim Burton just got a boner.

09:18.671 --> 09:20.410
Jeff, don't be sarcastic.

09:20.411 --> 09:21.836
Oh, are they on me now?

09:21.837 --> 09:23.344
Oh, no.

09:23.345 --> 09:24.618
They're eating him alive.

09:24.619 --> 09:26.147
If only he could find the power

09:26.148 --> 09:27.764
to not be a smug douche.

09:27.765 --> 09:29.287
Ah, no can do.

09:29.288 --> 09:30.802
I'm just a horrible guy.

09:30.805 --> 09:33.797
Guess I'll have to go get laid...

09:36.914 --> 09:38.759
Ooh, can I sing this one?

09:39.975 --> 09:42.155
Bitter shallow hipster

09:42.156 --> 09:44.438
sweater matching socks

09:44.439 --> 09:46.291
Christmas needs more presence

09:46.292 --> 09:50.070
than a haircut in a box.

09:50.489 --> 09:51.918
Annie, nice.

09:51.919 --> 09:53.905
Get what I did with the word presence?

09:55.604 --> 09:56.694
This is Carol canyon.

09:56.695 --> 09:57.547
Instead of oxygen,

09:57.548 --> 09:58.910
the plants produce Christmas songs.

09:58.911 --> 10:00.329
Will it cost a lot to walk through here?

10:00.330 --> 10:01.401
No, no, it's public domain.

10:01.402 --> 10:02.663
You guys know Jesus was born

10:02.664 --> 10:04.332
in the middle of April, right?

10:04.333 --> 10:06.124
The church moved his birthday to December

10:06.125 --> 10:07.553
so they could steal the solstice

10:07.554 --> 10:08.616
from the pagans.

10:08.617 --> 10:11.186
Season's greetings from Britta Perry.

10:11.334 --> 10:13.106
Maybe you could sing
a song about it, Britta.

10:13.107 --> 10:14.191
I don't sing.

10:14.192 --> 10:16.880
And if I did, I wouldn't sing
Christmas songs.

10:17.151 --> 10:18.573
I guess that means
you're gonna have me ejected

10:18.574 --> 10:19.957
from winter wonderland

10:19.958 --> 10:21.661
for not loving Christmas enough.

10:21.662 --> 10:22.995
Nope, not for that.

10:23.317 --> 10:25.060
Let's get to the cave of frozen memories.

10:25.619 --> 10:28.127
Man, it is cave-like in here.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.043
What do you mean, cave-like? It's a cave.

10:30.277 --> 10:31.446
Nothing to be afraid of.

10:31.447 --> 10:34.647
The cave of frozen memories is a safe place

10:34.648 --> 10:38.202
where we can observe suppressed experiences

10:38.203 --> 10:40.617
without being affected by them.

10:40.618 --> 10:41.764
Can you show me how to do it?

10:41.972 --> 10:42.868
Sure.

10:42.869 --> 10:45.601
Here, I'm focusing on a part of the cave,

10:45.602 --> 10:48.119
and I'm seeing my tenth Christmas.

10:48.120 --> 10:48.867
All right?

10:48.868 --> 10:50.744
Now you try with this morning.

10:51.373 --> 10:52.880
I can't see your tenth Christmas.

10:52.881 --> 10:54.046
How do you even know that's you?

10:54.047 --> 10:57.121
Well, it's my house on 52nd street

10:57.122 --> 10:58.086
in Islington.

10:58.087 --> 10:59.972
What room are you in?
What color are the walls?

10:59.973 --> 11:01.229
Our living room.

11:01.230 --> 11:02.740
Cream-colored plaster.

11:03.112 --> 11:04.511
There's an oil painting of a forest

11:04.512 --> 11:05.882
above the sofa.

11:06.322 --> 11:08.195
I'm reading Paddington books.

11:08.528 --> 11:10.894
Mom got me Paddington every year.

11:10.895 --> 11:12.076
Where's your dad?

11:12.315 --> 11:13.730
It's Christmas, professor.

11:13.731 --> 11:14.565
Where is your dad?

11:14.566 --> 11:16.819
I don't know! We never know!

11:16.820 --> 11:18.542
Mom won't stop crying!

11:18.543 --> 11:21.209
I'm going to America with grandma!

11:26.953 --> 11:28.729
He is good.

11:28.730 --> 11:29.964
We lost our wizard.

11:29.965 --> 11:31.364
We don't need him. Never did.

11:31.365 --> 11:32.911
And nobody needs this cave.

11:34.310 --> 11:35.710
Initiate self-destruct.

11:35.711 --> 11:38.054
Self-destruct initiating.

11:39.381 --> 11:41.836
This slide goes directly
to pine tree station.

11:41.837 --> 11:43.655
We can catch a train
to the north pole from there.

11:44.195 --> 11:45.038
The wizard didn't bring us here

11:45.039 --> 11:46.388
to find the meaning of Christmas.

11:46.389 --> 11:47.902
And I can't have anyone
going beyond this point

11:47.903 --> 11:49.211
that's on his side.

11:50.818 --> 11:52.087
With you to the end, man.

11:52.503 --> 11:53.716
Always.

11:59.659 --> 12:01.457
Like I said, I came for the cookies.

12:01.458 --> 12:02.450
Ouch!

12:02.849 --> 12:03.642
I'm not ejecting you

12:03.643 --> 12:05.246
for your not liking Christmas music,
Britta.

12:05.247 --> 12:06.400
I'm ejecting you for lying

12:06.401 --> 12:07.614
to trick me into therapy.

12:07.615 --> 12:10.739
Abed, they will kick you out of school.

12:10.752 --> 12:12.717
I was trying to save you.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.373
* Britta-bot

12:15.374 --> 12:17.623
programmed badly

12:17.939 --> 12:22.137
wires with fraying ends

12:22.389 --> 12:24.420
functioning

12:24.421 --> 12:26.733
mad and sadly

12:27.019 --> 12:30.654
no faith in herself

12:30.944 --> 12:33.877
or friends

12:36.160 --> 12:37.171
bye, Britta.

12:39.000 --> 12:45.074

12:50.281 --> 12:52.889
Damn, it got real up in that memory cave.

12:52.890 --> 12:54.181
I know, right?

12:54.182 --> 12:55.888
Speaking of real, this has been great.

12:55.889 --> 12:56.911
But the cookies are gone,

12:56.912 --> 12:58.517
and I have to take a giant leak.

13:00.813 --> 13:01.847
We should be at the north pole

13:01.848 --> 13:03.787
00 eastern candy time.

13:03.889 --> 13:05.302
You guys see the countryside?

13:05.547 --> 13:06.920
There's the menorah mountains.

13:06.921 --> 13:08.236
And Jehovah witness bay.

13:08.242 --> 13:09.765
Thanks for adding that, man.

13:11.013 --> 13:12.927
This is nicer than all the Christmases

13:12.928 --> 13:14.302
I ever celebrated.

13:14.303 --> 13:15.295
But you're Jewish.

13:15.296 --> 13:16.486
On my mom's side.

13:16.487 --> 13:18.152
But my dad's episcopalian.

13:18.153 --> 13:19.694
And before the divorce,

13:19.695 --> 13:22.478
the holidays were a minefield
of overlapping rituals.

13:22.479 --> 13:23.814
I like the rituals.

13:24.030 --> 13:25.556
My parents are divorced, too.

13:25.830 --> 13:26.940
My mom's Polish.

13:26.941 --> 13:28.308
She loves Christmas.

13:28.309 --> 13:30.197
Every year, she visits on the same day.

13:30.198 --> 13:31.205
December 9th.

13:31.206 --> 13:32.418
And every year, we sit and watch

13:32.419 --> 13:34.772
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer together,

13:34.956 --> 13:35.997
every year.

13:37.435 --> 13:39.929
But, Abed, today is December 9th.

13:40.288 --> 13:42.339
It's the last day of classes.

13:43.861 --> 13:44.779
Yeah.

13:44.780 --> 13:45.870
That can't be right.

13:45.871 --> 13:47.038
She comes every year.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.630
Today must be December 8th.

13:49.380 --> 13:50.636
'Cause she comes every year.

13:54.665 --> 13:55.689
Okay, Abed.

13:55.690 --> 13:57.107
Time to stop the train.

13:57.172 --> 13:59.586
After you emasculated me in the ice caves,

13:59.587 --> 14:01.336
I went to your dorm room.

14:01.344 --> 14:02.941
I know what happened now.

14:02.942 --> 14:03.571
It doesn't matter.

14:03.572 --> 14:04.644
I just need to get to the north pole.

14:04.645 --> 14:06.805
Abed, there is no north pole.

14:06.806 --> 14:08.348
We're in the library study room,

14:08.349 --> 14:10.177
and I'm not a Christmas wizard.

14:10.178 --> 14:10.891
I know.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.499
You're a Christmas warlock.

14:13.278 --> 14:14.445
You're trying to destroy Christmas

14:14.446 --> 14:15.937
because you blame your sadness on it.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.189
I'm crawling out the window.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.191
No, you're not.

14:18.192 --> 14:19.600
Snap out of it.

14:19.601 --> 14:20.854
Whoa, whoa, who taught you therapy?

14:20.855 --> 14:21.914
Michael Jackson's dad?

14:21.915 --> 14:23.415
I am a professional.

14:23.416 --> 14:24.261
And you are tampering

14:24.262 --> 14:26.119
with a highly delicate book deal.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.938
I mean, human being.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.339
Oh, now we're losing him.

14:29.340 --> 14:30.559
I'm on the roof of the train.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.385
Oh, great.

14:31.386 --> 14:33.619
Well, I'm teleporting there.

14:33.620 --> 14:35.002
Because I can do that.

14:35.003 --> 14:36.835
'Cause I'm a wizard.

14:36.836 --> 14:37.892
Bloink!

14:39.352 --> 14:41.478
Abed, there is no train.

14:41.479 --> 14:43.173
This is not real!

14:43.174 --> 14:44.225
I can't hear you.

14:44.226 --> 14:45.659
I'm going to the front car.

14:46.212 --> 14:47.386
You're very clever.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.115
But it stops here.

14:49.127 --> 14:50.610
There's no more journey.

14:50.611 --> 14:52.642
It's just you against reality.

14:52.643 --> 14:55.359
And reality always wins.

14:55.414 --> 14:56.564
Abed!

14:56.565 --> 14:58.556
I'm unhitching the cars, okay?

14:58.827 --> 15:00.997
What? Oh, give me a break.

15:00.998 --> 15:02.472
Do you know what you're doing?

15:02.473 --> 15:04.449
Bloink! We're learning to teleport.

15:04.450 --> 15:06.280
And we're helping our friend
find the meaning

15:06.281 --> 15:07.274
of Christmas.

15:07.275 --> 15:08.611
Hey, you're actually grabbing me

15:08.612 --> 15:10.272
in real life, delinquent!

15:10.273 --> 15:11.896
We'll keep him away, Abed!

15:11.897 --> 15:12.755
Go!

15:12.756 --> 15:14.622
Find the meaning of Christmas!

15:14.623 --> 15:15.899
At the very least,

15:15.900 --> 15:17.527
somebody take notes!

15:35.257 --> 15:36.950
Whoof. All right, where are we?

15:36.951 --> 15:38.079
Christmas train?

15:39.339 --> 15:40.822
I didn't wanna go home.

15:40.895 --> 15:42.790
It's depressing there this time of year.

15:57.933 --> 15:59.343
What are we looking at?

16:00.405 --> 16:01.671
Santa's workshop.

16:07.995 --> 16:08.593
Okay.

16:08.594 --> 16:10.328
So, meaning of Christmas, right?

16:10.438 --> 16:11.505
You see it?

16:12.349 --> 16:14.036
Well, can it just be anywhere?

16:14.106 --> 16:16.098
Like...There?

16:18.047 --> 16:19.224
Good job, Pierce.

16:31.799 --> 16:33.993
It's the first season of lost on DVD.

16:34.226 --> 16:35.952
That's the meaning of Christmas?

16:35.953 --> 16:37.309
No, it's a metaphor.

16:37.310 --> 16:38.705
It represents lack of payoff.

16:38.706 --> 16:39.909
Correct.

16:39.910 --> 16:41.471
Thinking there was something you could do

16:41.472 --> 16:42.821
to save Christmas,

16:42.822 --> 16:45.237
turning yourself into an animated character

16:45.238 --> 16:47.033
in search of the holiday's meaning,

16:47.034 --> 16:51.057
these were mechanisms you used
to escape this.

16:52.219 --> 16:53.545
This Christmas card.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.389
Left where you dropped it

16:55.390 --> 16:57.086
on the floor of your dorm.

16:57.557 --> 16:58.706
"Abed,

16:58.753 --> 17:00.424
"I can't make it this year.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.511
"I have a new family now.

17:02.766 --> 17:04.144
"You'll meet them one day.

17:04.451 --> 17:05.781
"You're a man now.

17:06.184 --> 17:07.606
"Take care of dad.

17:08.165 --> 17:09.442
Wash your dupa."

17:10.169 --> 17:11.616
Mommy's moved on.

17:12.454 --> 17:13.654
New family.

17:13.750 --> 17:14.883
New life.

17:15.792 --> 17:17.122
There's nothing left to do now

17:17.123 --> 17:18.464
but heal.

17:18.557 --> 17:20.794
And share the experience

17:20.795 --> 17:24.655
with as many reputable journals
as possible.

17:25.906 --> 17:26.790
Great.

17:26.791 --> 17:28.127
Look what you did to the kid.

17:28.128 --> 17:29.429
What's your article gonna be called?

17:29.430 --> 17:30.384
"Worst shrink ever"?

17:30.385 --> 17:32.309
Hey, this is not my fault.

17:32.310 --> 17:34.435
This is what Christmas does to people.

17:34.436 --> 17:36.129
We put too much meaning into it,

17:36.130 --> 17:37.545
and it lets us down.

17:38.212 --> 17:39.582
We beg to differ.

17:39.583 --> 17:40.805
What are you doing back here?

17:40.806 --> 17:42.356
Saving Christmas.

17:42.357 --> 17:45.855
Everybody point your magic Christmas
weapons at him.

17:47.030 --> 17:48.054
Oh, brother.

17:48.055 --> 17:49.187
This is ridiculous.

17:49.188 --> 17:51.388
You are enabling a delusion.

17:51.389 --> 17:52.797
The delusion you're trying to cure

17:52.798 --> 17:54.981
is called Christmas, Duncan.

17:54.982 --> 17:56.112
It's the crazy notion

17:56.113 --> 17:58.760
that the longest, coldest, darkest nights

17:58.761 --> 18:00.796
can be the warmest and brightest.

18:00.797 --> 18:03.148
Yeah, and when we all agree
to support each other

18:03.149 --> 18:04.411
in that insanity,

18:04.412 --> 18:06.896
something even crazier happens.

18:06.897 --> 18:08.403
It becomes true.

18:08.404 --> 18:09.961
Works every year.

18:09.962 --> 18:11.151
Like clockwork.

18:11.152 --> 18:13.628
Try telling that to your catatonic friend.

18:13.629 --> 18:14.954
I got a better idea.

18:14.955 --> 18:16.792
Why don't we sing it?

18:16.793 --> 18:18.904
- Wait... what?
- Yeah, let's not go overboard.

18:18.905 --> 18:20.521
Will you two commit to something
for a change?

18:20.522 --> 18:22.510
- Let's sing it.
- Yeah, let's sing.

18:22.511 --> 18:24.405
Can we sing while we blow Duncan away?

18:24.406 --> 18:25.688
Absolutely.

18:25.689 --> 18:27.337
Ow! Ah, ah!

18:27.662 --> 18:29.007
You start, Britta.

18:30.172 --> 18:33.526
* Christmas time is a time to sing

18:33.527 --> 18:36.400
that's what Christmas is for

18:36.484 --> 18:39.619
* Christmas can even be a Hanukkah thing

18:39.638 --> 18:42.161
that's what Christmas is for

18:42.162 --> 18:43.904
* and for a huge percentage

18:43.905 --> 18:45.432
of this God-fearing planet

18:45.433 --> 18:46.695
it's about the birth

18:46.696 --> 18:49.941
of Jesus Chri-i-ist

18:49.942 --> 18:51.329
* but for the rest of us

18:51.330 --> 18:52.776
it's still a good time

18:52.777 --> 18:56.072
to remember that it's good to be nice

18:56.073 --> 18:59.105
* music and cookies and licorice dreams

18:59.106 --> 19:01.909
that's what Christmas is for

19:02.001 --> 19:05.246
* video games for two straight weeks

19:05.247 --> 19:07.021
* that's what Christmas is for. *

19:07.022 --> 19:08.085
Hey, not the face.

19:08.086 --> 19:11.036
* hanging out with the people you love

19:11.037 --> 19:14.562
* and saying I love you

19:15.488 --> 19:18.511
* that's what Christmas is

19:18.512 --> 19:21.482
that's what Christmas is

19:21.483 --> 19:25.365
that's what Christmas

19:25.366 --> 19:27.678
is for...*

19:27.679 --> 19:31.847
And...Christmas pterodactyl!

19:33.162 --> 19:34.935
All right, all right. I'm leaving.

19:34.936 --> 19:37.293
Initiate self-destruct.

19:37.550 --> 19:39.434
Don't you think that's a little bit...

19:50.654 --> 19:51.684
I get it.

19:52.238 --> 19:53.890
The meaning of Christmas is...

19:54.048 --> 19:55.777
The idea that Christmas has meaning.

19:56.072 --> 19:57.620
And it can mean whatever we want.

19:57.829 --> 19:59.822
For me, it used to mean being with my mom.

20:00.695 --> 20:02.150
Now it means being with you guys.

20:04.362 --> 20:05.602
Thanks, lost.

20:11.835 --> 20:12.767
Wow.

20:13.075 --> 20:14.450
I feel so much better now.

20:14.751 --> 20:16.574
I guess we don't need to be
stop-motion anymore.

20:16.578 --> 20:18.396
Well, why not just keep it going

20:18.397 --> 20:19.864
for the rest of Christmas?

20:20.273 --> 20:22.995
It just feels so right.

20:28.362 --> 20:30.162
You ever get the urge to just...

20:30.872 --> 20:32.459
"Merry Christmas!"

20:32.680 --> 20:34.381
Ah, there.

20:34.382 --> 20:35.393
Said it.

20:49.237 --> 20:50.310
We're stop-motion again.

20:50.311 --> 20:51.735
Oh, don't worry, man. I did this.

20:51.736 --> 20:53.402
- You did?
- Yeah, it's cool.

20:53.403 --> 20:54.718
Oh. Why?

20:54.719 --> 20:56.402
Well, I always liked the way
fake food looked

20:56.403 --> 20:57.530
on those animated shows.

20:57.531 --> 20:59.598
I mean, get a load of these things.

20:59.599 --> 21:00.991
They really stepped up a notch

21:00.992 --> 21:02.585
in terms of visual deliciousness.

21:02.586 --> 21:03.365
I know what you mean.

21:03.366 --> 21:04.677
Look at that perfect bite.

21:05.059 --> 21:06.081
It's a little odd that I see this,
too, though,

21:06.082 --> 21:06.968
don't you think?

21:06.969 --> 21:09.871
Yeah. We're weird that way.

21:11.569 --> 21:13.084
Ah, that's better.

21:13.085 --> 21:14.416
So weird.
