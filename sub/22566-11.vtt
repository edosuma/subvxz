in return for him dropping

01:45.139 --> 01:46.474

01:46.574 --> 01:49.477
Firstly, Mr. Shaw did not
drop the investigation.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.379
His office determined
there was no basis for one.

02:28.316 --> 02:30.751

because you paid him off?

02:30.851 --> 02:32.286
Bribery isn't the problem.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.955
It wasn't bribery.

02:35.055 --> 02:37.425
Doesn't matter.
Call it what you want.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.126
Government is the problem.

02:39.227 --> 02:41.762
Government and its
ever-expanding regulation

02:41.862 --> 02:43.797
is the biggest obstacle
to the free market

02:43.897 --> 02:45.699

02:45.799 --> 02:49.102
So, if bribery helps destroy

Are you in love with her?

03:21.902 --> 03:22.736
Maybe, at one point.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.905
Near the beginning
of our relationship

03:25.005 --> 03:27.007
I was infatuated with her.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.910
She had the kind of career
and success that I wanted.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.680

how dependent she is

To be honest, I find
her clinginess repulsive.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.390
But she's been helpful
along the way.

She introduced me
to a lot of people

SANDRA:
I was looking
at the wire transfer

18:47.494 --> 18:49.162
from Peter Koscielny.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.397
What about it?

18:50.497 --> 18:53.533
Koscielny set up A4 Trust,
a shell company

18:53.633 --> 18:56.035
to make the transfer,
but ownership changed hands

18:56.135 --> 18:58.037
three days before
the wire was made.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.839
And a new company,
Citizens First

18:59.939 --> 19:02.209
now controls A4.

19:02.309 --> 19:04.177
I searched
for registration information

19:04.277 --> 19:06.679
for Citizens First

19:23.129 --> 19:24.497
No.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.201
But this isn't good.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.440
Citizens First is owned
by S.L.C. Holdings

19:33.540 --> 19:35.575
a shell company
also registered in Toronto

19:35.675 --> 19:38.211

19:43.883 --> 19:46.419
and Canada's eighth
largest company by revenue.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.121
Hoban Industries' core
businesses are in the oil

19:49.222 --> 19:51.691
and gas sectors,
primarily fossil fuel extraction

19:51.791 --> 19:54.527
and refining and distribution
of petrochemicals.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.829
What's Hoban's connection
to Koscielny?

19:56.929 --> 20:00.367
CIPC Capital has stakes
in several of Hoban's businesses

20:00.467 --> 20:02.802
including a minority position
in Hoban Industries.
