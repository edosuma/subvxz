WEBVTT

00:04.272 --> 00:05.506
So, you think
you'll be able to find

00:05.539 --> 00:06.807
the guy that
broke into my car?

00:06.840 --> 00:09.243
We tried to leave
the crime scene untouched.

00:09.277 --> 00:12.080
Except for some powder
on the dash when my mom tried

00:12.113 --> 00:15.349
to dust for prints
using her makeup brush.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.118
Well, we'll do our best
to find the culprit,

00:17.151 --> 00:19.520
but, uh, with these
small jobs, who knows?

00:19.553 --> 00:21.522
Who knows?
Is that your new slogan?

00:21.555 --> 00:23.157
Schoolkids will be

00:23.191 --> 00:25.526
so inspired when across
the side of your cruisers

00:25.559 --> 00:28.796
they read,
"Leesburg Police, Who Knows?"

00:30.398 --> 00:33.201
(chuckles)
Listen, I know you're upset,

00:33.234 --> 00:35.369
but, uh, I promise you,
we're gonna

00:35.403 --> 00:37.538
do everything we can
to find your...

00:37.571 --> 00:38.772
extendable windshield scraper,

00:38.806 --> 00:41.309
memory foam
steering wheel cover,

00:41.342 --> 00:43.477
pine tree air freshener

00:43.511 --> 00:46.114
that still has lots
of good smell left

00:46.147 --> 00:48.749
and a book on tape
by Suze Orman.

00:48.782 --> 00:51.085
Oh, they can keep
that. She's terrible.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.689
Well, like I said,
we'll do our best,

00:55.723 --> 00:58.492
but, uh, these smash-and-grabs
are hard to solve.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.428
Hard to solve?
Hard to solve?

01:00.461 --> 01:03.397
Thank you for coming,
Officer. Save yourself.

01:03.431 --> 01:04.665
Then why bother, right?

01:04.698 --> 01:06.834
Is it too hard
to increase patrols in the area

01:06.867 --> 01:09.537
or monitor the local pawnshops
for the stolen goods?

01:09.570 --> 01:10.738
Are you guys
too busy shoving

01:10.771 --> 01:14.542
bananas into each other's
tailpipes?

01:14.575 --> 01:15.776
Excuse me.
Where I put my banana is...

01:15.809 --> 01:19.113
You know what?
It's just...

01:19.147 --> 01:21.749
It's a reference to the movie
Beverly Hills Cop. It's just...

01:21.782 --> 01:23.751
Well, I'll call
if I hear anything.

01:23.784 --> 01:26.620
Maybe we'll answer.
Who knows?!

01:52.280 --> 01:54.615
Okay, let's not beat
around the bush.

01:54.648 --> 01:57.818
It's my birthday week, and
you people need to go shopping.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.590
"Blue striped scarf
from that kiosk at the mall.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.892
"Parentheses, the sales girl
has a big mole on her face.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.594
"It is not food.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.263
"Don't tell her
to brush it off."

02:09.297 --> 02:13.667
Mine says, "Spa massage
and no female therapist."

02:13.701 --> 02:15.269
It's my birthday.
(clicks tongue)

02:17.438 --> 02:19.873
My piece of
paper's blank.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.575
That's because all Grandma
wants from you for her birthday

02:21.609 --> 02:24.445
is a sweet little poem
about anything you want.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.446
Okay.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.747
Stick to nature themes.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.750
And I like
an ABBA rhyme scheme.

02:29.783 --> 02:33.421
And no cutesy made-up words--
it's a crutch.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.527
Mom, the fun of giving a gift

02:39.560 --> 02:41.429
is having it be
somewhat of a surprise.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.531
I mean, it's bad enough that
every time this family tries

02:43.564 --> 02:47.201
to throw you a surprise party,
you figure it out and ruin it.

02:47.235 --> 02:49.603
Well, I hope you liked
your birthday dinner.

02:49.637 --> 02:53.541
Guess now
we'll just watch some TV.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.543
Why don't you grab us
a few drinks from the kitchen.

02:55.576 --> 02:56.844
Nah.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.380
Why don't we have it
brought out by one of my...

02:59.413 --> 03:01.382
35 friends
standing in the kitchen!

03:01.415 --> 03:02.683
GUESTS:
Aw!

03:02.716 --> 03:04.585
Nice try.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.587
(quietly):
Okay.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.856
She just went upstairs
to use the bathroom.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.624
Everybody take your positions.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.393
Come on. How you doing?

03:12.426 --> 03:13.794
(chuckles):
This is...

03:13.827 --> 03:15.796
(whispers):
This is so exciting.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.966
Nice try.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.379
(mouthing)

03:31.412 --> 03:32.713
Nice try.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.014
OTHERS:
Aw!

03:34.047 --> 03:36.684
(screaming)

03:38.752 --> 03:40.788
I'm too smart
to be fooled.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.624
It's a burden I live with
every day of my life.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.260
Ten seconds into
The Crying Game,

03:46.294 --> 03:49.797
I yelled out, "It's a dude."

03:49.830 --> 03:51.999
Hey. Say hello
to the two newest members

03:52.032 --> 03:53.734
of the neighborhood watch.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.637
Hey, good for you,
doing your civic duty.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.839
Eh, with Nathan's car getting
broken into right out front,

03:58.872 --> 04:00.708
we felt we should.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.810
Plus, any organization
that would kick your mom out,

04:02.843 --> 04:04.745
I want to be part of.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.381
That's why I joined A.A.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.585
I didn't know the neighborhood
watch kicked you out.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.787
I was betrayed
by Louise Templeton.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.890
I don't know why those idiots
listen to her.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.492
For the past ten years,
she's been

04:18.526 --> 04:21.762
outwitted by
the same family of gophers.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.632
(sighs)

04:24.665 --> 04:26.434
Wow, it must be tiring

04:26.467 --> 04:28.736
always being the smartest person
in the room.

04:28.769 --> 04:29.903
Exhausting.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.672
The bad part

04:31.705 --> 04:33.974
about my birthdays is knowing
that I'm getting older

04:34.007 --> 04:36.777
and someday you people are gonna
have to fend for yourselves.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.512
I'll be up in Heaven,

04:38.546 --> 04:41.982
terrified to look down
to see what you're doing.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.684
(whispering):
Okay.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.687
Huddle up, huddle up.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.688
I'm telling you,
this is the year

04:47.721 --> 04:49.022
we can finally surprise her.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.658
Oh, I'd love to.
I mean, she always

04:50.691 --> 04:52.726
throws us such great birthdays;
she deserves it.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.695
And I'd love to finally knock
that superior look

04:54.728 --> 04:56.029
off of her face.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.366
I've never been
in a huddle before.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.834
Together, we can come up
with the perfect plan.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.370
Who's with me?

05:02.403 --> 05:03.771
Okay. I'm in.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.573
Me, too.
Me, too.

05:05.606 --> 05:06.407
Me, too.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.642
(others groan)

05:08.676 --> 05:10.978
Nice try.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.948
Hey, guys. All right, Ray,

05:14.982 --> 05:17.418
do a sweep of the house
for any signs of my mom.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.119
I'm on it.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.689
Adam, what are you
doing to my father?

05:21.722 --> 05:25.092
Dad has a raisin stuck somewhere
between his nose and his mouth.

05:25.125 --> 05:29.096
I'm just trying to figure out
whether he should suck or blow.

05:31.632 --> 05:35.068
I'm telling you, I taste it
more than I smell it.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.706
Wait, why is Ray
sweeping the house?

05:38.739 --> 05:41.909
Oh, because I was up all night
devising a foolproof plan

05:41.942 --> 05:43.811
to throw Mom a surprise party.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.446
No sign of Carol.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.648
I even looked
under the bed.

05:47.681 --> 05:51.151
Adam, you're
a weird dude.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.821
(clears throat)
That's mine, actually.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.460
So, this year, instead of
trying to outsmart her,

05:59.493 --> 06:01.595
we're gonna let her
outsmart herself.

06:01.629 --> 06:02.830
How, you ask?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.498
*

06:04.532 --> 06:06.934
Every great plan
starts with a ruse.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.171
The morning of her birthday,
we give her a cake

06:11.204 --> 06:13.741
to make her think
this is her celebration.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.909
If you wished for a hug
from a tall handsome man

06:15.943 --> 06:18.679
who smells like vanilla and
cedar, it's about to come true.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.848
(chuckles)
Mmm...

06:20.881 --> 06:24.585
Then we act like the obedient
sheep she expects us to be.

06:24.618 --> 06:25.919
I love it.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.455
That's the right one?

06:27.488 --> 06:29.890
I was nervous that I went
to the wrong scarf kiosk

06:29.923 --> 06:33.594
run by a girl with
a disgusting mole on her face.

06:33.627 --> 06:34.828
Here you go, Carol.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.030
Thank you, Ray.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.066
Pepper spray?

06:39.099 --> 06:40.734
I know you weren't feeling safe

06:40.768 --> 06:41.935
after Nathan's car
got broken into.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.537
Look at
the inscription.

06:43.571 --> 06:44.872
"If you can read this,

06:44.905 --> 06:46.940
you are a rapist and
about to go blind."

06:49.042 --> 06:51.912
Then we hit her
with a little misdirection.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.881
Later that day, Debbie arrives

06:53.914 --> 06:56.183
to take Mom away
to her big spa day.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.652
Mom, I've arrived to take you
away to your big spa day.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.721
Great. Let me get my purse.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.624
Oh, forget it.
Your money is no good here.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.526
Neither is mine.
Nathan, credit card?

07:05.559 --> 07:08.496
Then we plant the bait.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.864
Whenever we try to bring Mom
somewhere on her birthday,

07:10.898 --> 07:12.733
she's nervous and mistrustful.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.502
So, we just going to the spa?

07:14.535 --> 07:16.804
I wonder if I'll see
someone I know there or...

07:16.837 --> 07:18.806
25 partygoers I know there.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.742
So this time, we'll encourage
her not to go somewhere

07:21.775 --> 07:24.878
and let her own stubbornness
bring her to her party.

07:24.912 --> 07:27.915
Nope, it's just you and me
getting very long massages.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.883
I want to be out of the house
as long as possible

07:29.917 --> 07:31.852
so I miss the neighborhood
watch meeting.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.555
There's a meeting
at our house?
Oh, right.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.490
Uh, they're-they're voting,
uh, to put up

07:36.524 --> 07:37.958
the surveillance cameras
in the neighborhood.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.960
Cameras? Cameras?
Of course

07:39.993 --> 07:42.496
they're using technology
to do the work for them.

07:42.530 --> 07:45.165
Like kids with their calculators
and shoes with wheels.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.868
Don't get all worked up, Mom.
It's your birthday, okay?

07:47.901 --> 07:50.538
Let's-let's just go
to the spa and relax.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.772
Yeah.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.073
I've got a flask full of vodka

07:53.106 --> 07:54.875
we can put
in the cucumber water.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.912
Then we reel her in.

07:58.946 --> 08:01.081
We all know
Mom won't be able to relax.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.016
Her only mission
will be getting herself

08:03.050 --> 08:04.618
to that neighborhood watch
meeting.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.286
Maybe I should
postpone this.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.956
My vertebrae are feeling
especially brittle today.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.224
Plus, I skipped
my bone density yogurt.

08:11.258 --> 08:13.761
Okay, I think you're sturdy
enough for a massage.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.763
Last Easter,
I saw you walk three blocks

08:15.796 --> 08:17.631
carrying a cross
made out of railroad ties.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.068
And then Debbie turns the screw
a little more.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.936
I'm just glad to be here
with you instead of back

08:22.970 --> 08:25.005
at my house with
Louise Templeton.

08:25.038 --> 08:28.008
Louise Templeton's coming to
the neighborhood watch meeting?

08:28.041 --> 08:30.277
Of course. She's the president.
What?!

08:30.310 --> 08:32.145
I think she bribed the
voters with her famous

08:32.179 --> 08:34.081
coconut-peanut butter
crispy treats.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.649
They're called
Crispy Flabbergasters,

08:35.683 --> 08:37.117
and I invented them.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.620
And then we have Mom
right where we want her.

08:39.653 --> 08:40.854
Carol.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.255
Nice to see you again.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.191
Aw, enjoy your massage, Mom.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.529
(sighs heavily)

08:57.070 --> 08:58.872
Then Debbie leaves
her car behind

08:58.906 --> 09:01.041
so Mom thinks she's still
inside and rushes home

09:01.074 --> 09:03.911
on Mikayla's bike
she stashed earlier.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.948
(panting)

09:10.250 --> 09:11.952
Meanwhile, Mom will try
to relax,

09:11.985 --> 09:13.621
but we all know
that will be impossible.

09:13.654 --> 09:16.724
Juan Mario,
wipe the oil off your hands

09:16.757 --> 09:18.125
and toss me my panties.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.260
Mama needs a rain check.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.762
Mom will want to get
to the meeting

09:21.795 --> 09:23.263
without Debbie catching her,

09:23.296 --> 09:25.799
so she'll find her own way back
to the house.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.367
Oh. Excuse me.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.102
Which way
is the nearest bus stop?

09:29.136 --> 09:31.304
To make sure
we time things right,

09:31.338 --> 09:33.306
we need good intel.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.142
That's where you come in, Adam.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.144
Adam will stake out
the end of the block

09:37.177 --> 09:38.612
and tell us when Mom's coming.

09:38.646 --> 09:41.014
(phone ringing)

09:42.249 --> 09:44.151
Hey, Nate. I'm in position.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.986
NATHAN: Great.
I'll make sure to call you
the minute...

09:46.019 --> 09:48.321
(yawning): that I see her
walking down the street.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.157
Sorry about yawning.

09:50.190 --> 09:53.026
Adam, do not fall asleep.
Don't worry, Nate.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.929
Despite my reputation
as being a lover of car naps,

09:55.963 --> 09:57.665
I will not doze off, okay?

09:57.698 --> 10:00.300
I got my large full-caf latte
right here.

10:00.333 --> 10:04.004
And, since I've been drinking
only decaf since 1998,

10:04.037 --> 10:06.840
if this car's a-rockin'...
(chuckles)

10:06.874 --> 10:10.177
I'm probably having a seizure,
so please call for help.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.180
Adam, buddy,
you can't fall asleep,

10:13.213 --> 10:16.083
so whatever you do,
keep the dial off NPR.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.118
All right, we're gonna be
waiting for your call.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.787
You guys almost done
with those balloons?

10:19.820 --> 10:21.989
Yep. Your mom's
gonna love 'em.

10:22.022 --> 10:25.192
They say "Happy Hanukkah."

10:25.225 --> 10:26.694
What? Those aren't
birthday balloons.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.028
Ray, why is my mom
gonna love 'em?

10:28.061 --> 10:29.830
These were half-off.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.999
And there's only one thing a
mom loves more than a bargain,

10:32.032 --> 10:34.334
and that's comfortable
undergarments.

10:34.367 --> 10:37.337
And I'm not ready to
cross that line yet.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.007
All right,
check out this cake.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.009
It's pieced together
from four different bakeries

10:42.042 --> 10:44.177
so no one place would know
the complete message.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.379
Mm.

10:46.413 --> 10:49.349
"No more Mrs. Nice Try."

10:49.382 --> 10:53.153
Oh, you're trying to be witty.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.455
Oh.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.157
You are a cute kid.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.192
I'm telling you,
this is the year

10:59.226 --> 11:00.861
we're finally
gonna surprise her.

11:00.894 --> 11:04.064
Everything so far is going
exactly according to plan.

11:04.097 --> 11:07.034
I am just gonna go and
say "hi" to all the guests.

11:08.869 --> 11:12.105
Dad, where are all the guests?

11:12.139 --> 11:13.306
I don't know.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.008
I assumed they were hiding.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.143
(panting)

11:16.176 --> 11:17.745
Sorry I'm late.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.179
If I were a big-breasted woman,

11:19.212 --> 11:21.248
riding this bicycle
would be impossible.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.083
If you were
a big-breasted woman,

11:23.116 --> 11:26.119
someone would have
offered you a ride.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.955
Where is everyone?

11:27.988 --> 11:29.156
Yeah, I'm just trying
to figure that out.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.457
Dad, you invited everyone,
right?

11:30.490 --> 11:32.025
I didn't know I was supposed to.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.260
Are you kidding me?!

11:33.293 --> 11:35.428
You had one responsibility,
Dad, one!

11:35.462 --> 11:37.097
I thought I was
in charge of ice.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.266
By the way, we should probably
fill up the trays.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.834
Oh, my God.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.169
Dad, you ruined the party!

11:42.202 --> 11:43.403
I specifically told you

11:43.436 --> 11:46.206
that you were in charge
of inviting the guests.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.141
Remember? We were sitting
right here watching Matlock.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.410
Wait. Nathan, you can't tell him
something during Matlock

11:50.443 --> 11:51.979
and expect him to remember it.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.180
Oh, the party's ruined.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.982
I could pack this room
full of ladies,

11:55.015 --> 11:56.183
but it's gonna cost you.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.151
You know what?

11:58.185 --> 11:59.953
You know, maybe...
maybe it's not ruined.

11:59.987 --> 12:02.022
I mean, we're all here, right?

12:02.055 --> 12:05.392
We got... we got decorations
and cake and presents.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.327
Check it out;
I got her a necklace

12:07.360 --> 12:08.962
with her children's
birthstones.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.031
That's not my birthstone.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.801
Yeah, I got two of mine.
Nobody likes topaz.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.803
Okay, right, I guess
all we're really trying

12:15.836 --> 12:18.238
to do here is surprise her,
so, yeah, I think we're good.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.774
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's not panic, okay?

12:20.808 --> 12:23.110
We got a room full of people
she loves, plus Dad.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.845
I'll go get the cake.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.449
What the...?

12:29.482 --> 12:32.886
Care for some cake?

12:32.920 --> 12:35.122
I don't have my
reading glasses.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.190
What does it say?

12:37.224 --> 12:38.826
"Nice try."

12:38.859 --> 12:40.928
Were you trying to be...?

12:40.961 --> 12:43.296
Witty. Yes, I was
trying to be...

12:49.569 --> 12:51.138
This is unbelievable!

12:51.171 --> 12:52.940
I can't believe
you figured this out!

12:52.973 --> 12:54.908
Hey, what's going...?

12:54.942 --> 12:56.309
(gasps)
She's the Devil.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.546
So when did you figure this out?

12:59.579 --> 13:01.148
You know what?
I almost didn't.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.850
I was pretty worked up

13:02.883 --> 13:04.317
about the neighborhood watch
meeting

13:04.351 --> 13:08.221
until Juan Mario
released a big knot in my back.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.323
(groans loudly)

13:10.357 --> 13:12.392
Ooh, yeah!

13:12.425 --> 13:16.363
And once I was relaxed,
my brain went to work.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.032
Great! Let me get my purse.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.468
The first thing
that was a little off was

13:21.501 --> 13:23.170
when Debbie asked for money.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.238
Oh, forget it, Mom.
Your money's no good here.

13:25.272 --> 13:28.175
Neither is mine.
Nathan, credit card?

13:28.208 --> 13:30.043
Usually when
you give her money,

13:30.077 --> 13:32.279
you tack on
a snide comment, like...

13:32.312 --> 13:34.882
"Maybe I should change
my name to Debbie

13:34.915 --> 13:36.583
since you always
have my credit card."

13:36.616 --> 13:38.518
Or at the very least a...

13:38.551 --> 13:41.254
"Ha, ha! I have
more money than you!"

13:41.288 --> 13:43.857
But instead, you quietly
reached into your wallet

13:43.891 --> 13:46.226
and gave her your credit card.

13:48.628 --> 13:51.198
Then, when we were walking
into the spa,

13:51.231 --> 13:54.601
I thought I spotted
Mikayla's bike in the bushes.

13:54.634 --> 13:58.138
But sometimes I think I see
Dan Rather at the Food Lion,

13:58.171 --> 14:00.207
so I don't trust my eyes.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.875
But what really gave you away
was Debbie.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.243
You know how when she lies

14:03.276 --> 14:04.611
she starts giving
too many details.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.279
So, for the meeting,
Dad cut eight lemons,

14:06.313 --> 14:07.580
but Adam didn't think
that was enough

14:07.614 --> 14:09.382
because people tend to
really like iced tea,

14:09.416 --> 14:11.118
and they were expecting
14 people; Dad was wearing

14:11.151 --> 14:12.152
that white button-up shirt, dark
blue jeans and those loafers

14:12.185 --> 14:13.954
he has-- not the brown ones
with the buckles,

14:13.987 --> 14:15.322
but the tan ones
without the buckles.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.489
I guess he wanted to look
nice for the meeting.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.325
I'm just glad to
be here with you

14:18.358 --> 14:20.060
instead of back at my house
with Louise Templeton.

14:20.093 --> 14:23.296
That's when I put
all the pieces together.

14:23.330 --> 14:26.133
Juan Mario,
wipe the oil off your hands

14:26.166 --> 14:27.867
and toss me my panties.

14:29.402 --> 14:32.205
I saw her car in
the parking lot, but no bike.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.974
I knew I had to get
to the bus quickly

14:34.007 --> 14:36.276
if I was going to catch
all of you trying to give me

14:36.309 --> 14:39.512
the surprise party
I've always dreamed of.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.281
And your look-out was...

14:41.314 --> 14:42.916
(snoring)

14:42.950 --> 14:45.919
...a bad choice.

14:45.953 --> 14:48.521
I'd say that it didn't take
a genius to figure this out,

14:48.555 --> 14:51.091
but it kind of did.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.625
I think Carol might be close!

14:52.659 --> 14:55.228
Damn it.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.997
Way to go, Adam.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.331
You fell asleep
at the wheel,

14:58.365 --> 14:59.699
which, for most people,
is a metaphor,

14:59.732 --> 15:01.634
but somehow
you made it come true.

15:01.668 --> 15:05.338
What are you gonna do next?
Have this cake and eat it, too?

15:05.372 --> 15:06.639
Hey, you know what?
Don't yell at Adam.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.308
Just admit you had
a stupid plan.

15:08.341 --> 15:11.444
The only thing stupid about my
plan was the partners I chose.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.280
It would have worked fine if
Debbie had been a better liar,

15:13.313 --> 15:15.282
or Dad could remember to do
what I told him to do!

15:15.315 --> 15:18.385
Filling up the ice trays?!
How would that have helped?!

15:20.387 --> 15:22.322
God help you people if I die.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.124
I thought maybe
this was the year

15:24.157 --> 15:25.725
I could stop worrying
about my health.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.428
Eat cake instead of salad,
maybe smoke a little,

15:28.461 --> 15:31.965
find a crooked doctor and get
some fun prescriptions, but no.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.466
I got to stay healthy

15:33.500 --> 15:36.669
so I can keep taking care
of you dumb-dumbs.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.572
And that's the real present
you want every year, isn't it?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.508
You love the ego boost
of thinking

15:41.541 --> 15:43.743
that without you,
we'd all fall apart.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.278
Well, wake up.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.446
You made us this way--

15:46.479 --> 15:48.048
dependent on you.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.582
But you know what? It's over.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.452
Because from now on,
I don't want or need your help.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.292
I can't find my keys.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.628
Thank you.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.363
It was a good speech.

16:03.396 --> 16:06.533
Shut up!

16:06.566 --> 16:10.437
Anyway, that's why I'm
missing so many toenails.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.671
Hmm.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.740
Well, thanks for
driving me home, Ray,

16:13.773 --> 16:15.775
but I would have been
perfectly fine walking.

16:15.808 --> 16:19.012
After Nate got his car
broken into, no way.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.114
Well, thank you, Ray.
(patting knee)

16:21.148 --> 16:23.783
I love your car.
It's so roomy.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.752
Yeah.
You could fit
another car in the back.

16:25.785 --> 16:28.055
(screaming)
(yelling)

16:29.356 --> 16:31.658
(yelling)

16:31.691 --> 16:33.293
Mom!
Nathan!

16:33.326 --> 16:35.262
Yes, Nathan!
Oh! Oh!

16:35.295 --> 16:36.763
What were you doing?!

16:36.796 --> 16:39.499
I was trying to surprise you
one last time!
Oh!

16:39.532 --> 16:41.168
Look, I got you a necklace.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.636
Why do you have to make
everything so difficult?!

16:45.705 --> 16:46.673
(sighs)

16:46.706 --> 16:47.607
Of all the different ways

16:47.640 --> 16:50.510
you tried to surprise me,
why a carjacking?

16:50.543 --> 16:53.280
Well, I was desperate.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.815
My plan had fallen apart,
I just...

16:55.848 --> 16:58.118
I walked out, I saw Ray's
snow gear in the car,

16:58.151 --> 16:59.819
and I just thought
I'd give it a shot.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.589
Like most carjackings,
it was a crime of opportunity.

17:02.622 --> 17:07.094
Oh, my gosh,
Nathan Miller from WXDN?

17:07.127 --> 17:08.761
You're my favorite reporter.

17:08.795 --> 17:11.198
I didn't realize
it would be so easy

17:11.231 --> 17:13.433
to recognize you
just from your mouth.

17:13.466 --> 17:16.203
Oh, great lips,
by the way.

17:16.236 --> 17:20.140
I'd love to watch you
eat a peach in slow motion.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.275
(sighs)
What happened?

17:22.309 --> 17:24.377
My mother
pepper-sprayed him.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.147
Okay, great. You can
come with me, Mr. Miller.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.548
I'll take you
right back. Here.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.783
Hold my hand.
Oh.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.721
Tighter.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.456
Wait-wait a second.
Wait a second.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.691
I-I got something I got to
say to my mother before I go.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.428
Mom, this is a hospital,

17:41.461 --> 17:44.164
and a lot of unexpected things
can happen.

17:44.197 --> 17:47.167
So I guess I just wanted
one last chance to say...

17:47.200 --> 17:48.435
surprise.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.737
ALL:
Surprise!

17:50.770 --> 17:52.139
(whooping and cheering)

17:52.172 --> 17:53.806
Oh, my! Oh!

17:53.840 --> 17:56.776
Susan! Oh.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.579
And Jimmy and Mary, you drove
all the way from Myrtle Beach!

17:59.612 --> 18:01.448
Betty.

18:01.481 --> 18:02.849
Betty, is that you?

18:02.882 --> 18:05.218
I thought you were dead. Oh.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.220
Oh.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.821
And you're not really hurt?

18:08.855 --> 18:11.224
No. The pepper spray that
Ray gave you was just water.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.193
I ordered it
from an online joke store.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.762
And, Debbie,
you were in on this, too?

18:15.795 --> 18:17.564
No. Kind of freaked
out right now.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.831
I'm very confused.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.400
(clears throat)

18:20.433 --> 18:21.834
When did you start
plotting this?

18:21.868 --> 18:24.837
From the very beginning.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.840
The first thing I did was
steal stuff out of my own car.

18:27.874 --> 18:31.144
Then I hired a fake cop to come
and take the police report.

18:31.178 --> 18:33.446
However, there was a little
confusion about what services

18:33.480 --> 18:36.149
I was hiring the fake cop for.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.917
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.886
I kept everyone in the dark
on my plan,

18:39.919 --> 18:42.155
because let's face it,

18:42.189 --> 18:44.224
I wasn't exactly dealing
with the brightest crew.

18:44.257 --> 18:47.360
Dad was right; I never actually
told him to invite the guests.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.529
Though we did watch
an episode of Matlock,

18:49.562 --> 18:51.798
and it was surprisingly good.

18:51.831 --> 18:55.568
This is surprisingly good.

18:55.602 --> 18:58.471
The night of Mom's birthday,
I switched out Adam's latte.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.807
Hey, buddy, how about
a hug good-bye?

19:00.840 --> 19:02.309
Oh, my God.

19:02.342 --> 19:05.378
Nine years, and finally
you asked me first.

19:08.315 --> 19:11.150
The whole time, he was chugging
decaf and warm milk.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.956
I knew that Mom was aware
of Debbie's bad lying skills,

19:16.989 --> 19:19.359
and my snarkiness
when she asked for money.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.928
So I exploited them
and put her on the wrong track.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.496
And then
I used my connections

19:23.530 --> 19:25.198
here at the hospital
to arrange this party.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.567
Might cost me my job,
but years from now,

19:27.600 --> 19:30.470
we're gonna tell our kids this
story and laugh, right, Nate?

19:30.503 --> 19:32.539
(chuckles): I'm just kidding.
I'm very fertile.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.243
All right, everybody,
let's keep this party going

19:36.276 --> 19:38.345
across the street
at McGee's Rib Shack!

19:38.378 --> 19:40.580
Be careful on the
way out not to slip.

19:40.613 --> 19:43.350
There was stabbing victim
earlier who lost a lot of blood.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.520
Well, Mom, even though
I feel very used

19:47.554 --> 19:49.822
by my brother right now,
it was worth it.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.524
You finally got
a birthday as good

19:51.558 --> 19:53.760
as the ones you've given us,
and you deserve it.

19:56.296 --> 19:59.666
Hey, after we eat some ribs,
we're gonna go out

19:59.699 --> 20:02.201
and find the guy
who did this to you.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.408
You know what?

20:08.441 --> 20:10.677
Maybe Dad can get a CAT scan
while we're here.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.445
(chuckles)

20:12.479 --> 20:14.547
Honestly, are you
a little disappointed

20:14.581 --> 20:16.283
that I finally outsmarted you?

20:16.316 --> 20:17.850
Maybe just a little bit?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.252
Are you kidding?

20:19.286 --> 20:21.421
This is the best gift
I could have gotten.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.556
Now that I know there's
someone else smart enough

20:23.590 --> 20:26.526
to take care of this family,
I'm not afraid to die anymore.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.629
I can finally find out
what a rave is all about.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.799
That's great, Mom.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.268
Happy birthday.
I love you.

20:37.304 --> 20:40.440
By the way, I do not want to
take over for many, many years.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.377
Bye, Nate.
You owe me a dinner.

20:44.411 --> 20:45.745
Just kidding.

20:45.778 --> 20:48.781
Not really!
I'm off on Thursdays!

20:53.486 --> 20:54.887
(silly groaning)

20:54.921 --> 20:56.389
Aah! Aah!

20:56.423 --> 20:57.990
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.992
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.962
(screaming, laughing)

21:02.995 --> 21:05.365
Ooh, that little piggy
went to Heaven.

21:05.398 --> 21:08.568
Ooh, baby.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.069
Nobody can ever know about this.
