the paint and the explosives

the paint will be propelled
out the nozzle of the tank

09:25.159 --> 09:26.760

Water is incompressible.

That means that there's pressure
on the hull.

Second reason is that

canvasses his canvases...

27:38.754 --> 27:40.021
Oh, yeah.

27:40.022 --> 27:41.522
That's really nice.

27:41.523 --> 27:45.293
...It's clear that all six
were mostly covered with paint.

27:45.294 --> 27:46.862
Well, I don't know much about art,

27:46.863 --> 27:48.696

making it with explosives.

27:48.697 --> 27:51.299
Hey, well, two of them
have some nice colors going.

27:51.300 --> 27:52.600
They show some promise.

27:52.601 --> 27:54.870
Maybe... maybe you could take
an art class or something.

27:54.871 --> 27:57.605
[ Laughs ]
What do you think?

27:57.606 --> 27:59.274
I'm very pleased. I'm very pleased.

27:59.275 --> 28:00.808
But while the results

28:00.809 --> 28:03.478
of Adam's art deco are a little muddy,

28:03.479 --> 28:05.780
it's the process that was beautiful.

28:08.784 --> 28:11.552
Nice. Can't wait to see
what Jamie comes up with.

28:11.553 --> 28:13.088
Top that, Hyneman.

28:13.089 --> 28:15.323
Next, will a rocket sled

28:15.324 --> 28:18.626
close the case
on this unsolved myth-tery?

28:18.627 --> 28:19.827
Tory: This is it, man.

28:19.828 --> 28:21.796
Hopefully, we can cut this boat in half.

28:21.797 --> 28:24.665
And can Jamie's paint ball
deck the wall?

28:24.666 --> 28:27.869

this one from the bunker.

You guys ready for this?

28:53.530 --> 28:56.532
If there's one thing I like, it's fast.

28:56.533 --> 28:57.934
Let's do it.

29:00.337 --> 29:04.540
Grant: When we want to fly a wall
down a track and pulverize a car,

29:04.541 --> 29:05.975
when we want to cause

29:05.976 --> 29:09.245
a rear-end collision
at nearly 400 miles an hour...

29:09.246 --> 29:11.681
[ Laughing ] That was one of the
coolest things I've ever seen!

29:11.682 --> 29:13.215
...we come here

29:13.216 --> 29:15.685
because, "A," there's no one
around to get in harm's way,

29:15.686 --> 29:17.954
and, "B," nobody does extreme

29:17.955 --> 29:20.289
like our friends at new Mexico Tech.

29:20.290 --> 29:22.992
And today is gonna be no exception.

29:22.993 --> 29:26.029
So, why are we taking it
to these extremes

29:26.030 --> 29:28.131
and using a rocket-powered sled?

29:28.132 --> 29:30.332
Well, we tested
the myth just like it stated,

29:30.333 --> 29:33.235
crashing a boat at 25 miles
an hour into a channel marker,

29:33.236 --> 29:35.104
but we couldn't get it to split in half.

29:35.105 --> 29:36.605
So, the myth is busted.

29:36.606 --> 29:38.775
But now it's my favorite part
of the show,

29:38.776 --> 29:40.309
where we replicate the results.

29:40.310 --> 29:42.244
Now, if it's worth doing,
it's worth overdoing,

29:42.245 --> 29:43.980
and I would have to say
this is overdoing.

29:43.981 --> 29:46.282
Kari: Now, this is the boat
that we're going to use.

29:46.283 --> 29:48.951
It's not the exact same boat
as the one in the myth,

29:48.952 --> 29:50.452
but it's gonna do just fine.

29:50.453 --> 29:51.821
It will be weighted the same.

29:51.822 --> 29:53.556
It's made of the same materials.

29:53.557 --> 29:55.158
And the center of the bow

29:55.159 --> 29:57.626
is still hitting the center of the pole.

29:57.627 --> 29:59.028
There's only one difference.

29:59.029 --> 30:00.830
Narrator: Yep, and the reason
for that difference

30:00.831 --> 30:03.766
is very familiar to the MythBusters.

30:03.767 --> 30:05.434
Grant: Cable broke.
[Bleep]

30:05.435 --> 30:08.671
And inside NMT's high-tech classroom...

30:08.672 --> 30:10.173
Hey, Van. Welcome back.

30:10.174 --> 30:13.209
...Van Romero has the solution.

30:13.210 --> 30:15.344
Flying the boat down a track
is a little tricky.

30:15.345 --> 30:17.880
Getting a boat to go 100,
150 miles an hour...

30:17.881 --> 30:19.916
what's gonna happen
with a fast acceleration

30:19.917 --> 30:21.483
is it's probably gonna fly apart.

30:21.484 --> 30:23.619
But we do have another option.

30:23.620 --> 30:25.521
Instead of moving
the boat down the track,

30:25.522 --> 30:28.290
let's look at moving
the piling down the track.

30:28.291 --> 30:29.325
Awesome.

30:29.326 --> 30:30.526
If we do that,

30:30.527 --> 30:32.929
we can accelerate this pipe
as fast as we want.

30:32.930 --> 30:34.030
We won't have any problems.

30:34.031 --> 30:35.231
The physics is identical

30:35.232 --> 30:36.866
as long as we get the closing speed

30:36.867 --> 30:38.367
to match the closing speed that we want.

30:38.368 --> 30:40.469
Narrator: The roles will be reversed,

30:40.470 --> 30:42.404
and the pylon will hit the boat

30:42.405 --> 30:44.874
traveling at the top speed
of a speedboat.

30:44.875 --> 30:47.777
So, it's time to trek back to the track

30:47.778 --> 30:49.445
and prepare the sled.

30:49.446 --> 30:51.914
Grant: The first thing you'll
probably notice about the pole

30:51.915 --> 30:54.250
is unlike our previous experiment,

30:54.251 --> 30:56.219
it's metal instead of wood.

30:56.220 --> 30:59.421
The reason for this is that at
the speeds we're talking about,

30:59.422 --> 31:00.623
wood would simply shatter,

31:00.624 --> 31:02.291
where we know
the metal's not gonna shatter.

31:02.292 --> 31:03.292
The more important thing

31:03.313 --> 31:04.313
is the sheer amount

31:04.338 --> 31:05.799
of kinetic energy it's gonna generate.

31:05.809 --> 31:08.745
The pole plus the sled
weighs almost 600 pounds.

31:08.746 --> 31:11.648
It's gonna be traveling
at nearly 200 miles per hour.

31:11.649 --> 31:14.984
See, the key to any good
rocket-sled experiment...

31:14.985 --> 31:16.920
lubrication.

31:16.921 --> 31:19.322
That's the kind
of kinetic energy we need

31:19.323 --> 31:21.992
to give this boat split
a fighting chance.

31:22.019 --> 31:26.022
Narrator: But first, the marker
needs a maritime makeover.

31:26.023 --> 31:28.191
So, we're out here
in the middle of New Mexico.

31:28.192 --> 31:29.993
There's not a lot of ocean around, so...

31:29.994 --> 31:31.060
[ Seagull honking ]

31:31.061 --> 31:32.262
We decided to make it more marine-like.

31:32.263 --> 31:34.497
So, we brought a seagull.

31:34.498 --> 31:36.232
[ Seagull honking ]

31:37.301 --> 31:39.802
Is that the most irritating
thing you've ever heard?

31:39.803 --> 31:42.538
Narrator:
With the pole sitting pretty...

31:42.539 --> 31:43.940
[ Honking continues ]
Kari: Aww.

31:43.941 --> 31:46.509
...It's the boat's turn to get nautical.

31:46.510 --> 31:48.111
Ocean spray.

31:48.112 --> 31:49.512
We're going to add
a little water to this boat

31:49.513 --> 31:50.780
just to keep the fans happy.

31:50.781 --> 31:53.749

So, it's floating on air.

32:01.691 --> 32:04.060
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

32:04.061 --> 32:05.694
The boat's in place.

32:05.695 --> 32:07.964
Now it's time to load up
the sled with rockets

32:07.965 --> 32:10.266
and see if we can
split this boat in half.

32:10.267 --> 32:12.468
Three, two, one!

32:23.247 --> 32:25.348
...and created art with explosives.

32:25.349 --> 32:27.283
That's beautiful!

32:27.284 --> 32:31.921
But now it's the Hyneman's
turn to paint and detonate.

[ Ominous music plays ]
You need that.

32:33.324 --> 32:36.625
I do. It's time to load it up.

32:36.626 --> 32:39.762
The myth requires 100% wall coverage,

32:39.763 --> 32:42.465
so Jamie's reducing his boom.

32:42.466 --> 32:44.533
On our first test, we used C-4,

32:44.534 --> 32:47.070
which is a very fast, high explosive.

32:47.071 --> 32:48.972
This time, we've slowed it down

32:48.973 --> 32:53.142
to about 1/4 or 1/5 of that
speed with ditching dynamite.

32:53.143 --> 32:56.112
This stuff goes off
at about 5,000 feet per second,

32:56.113 --> 33:00.049
and I'm hoping that it'll have
a lot more push with it.

33:00.050 --> 33:01.650

out through the jets.

paint thickness will be

for this particular spray-paint job.

33:48.465 --> 33:50.833
I mean, normally,

33:50.834 --> 33:53.202
you thin paint a little bit
when you put it in a sprayer,

33:53.203 --> 33:56.239
so I figure
this wouldn't be any different.

33:56.240 --> 33:58.841
And in any case, the thinner the paint,

33:58.842 --> 34:02.011
the more it's gonna break apart
when it's sprayed.

34:02.012 --> 34:03.812

37:35.367 --> 37:37.601
So, I heard you got some rockets for us.

37:39.304 --> 37:42.306
[ Deep voice ] This is the most
dangerous part of our day...

37:42.307 --> 37:44.242
loading the rockets onto the sled.

37:44.243 --> 37:45.409
[ Laughs maniacally ]

37:45.410 --> 37:47.344
Narrator: It's dangerous all right.

37:47.345 --> 37:51.849
In fact, it's so dangerous,
it requires a costume change.

37:52.851 --> 37:55.019
This is an incredibly tense moment,

37:55.020 --> 37:57.021
and the reason is that the rockets

37:57.022 --> 38:00.024
have their igniters pre-installed.

38:00.025 --> 38:03.694
So, just by handling them,
they could ignite,

38:03.695 --> 38:06.964
and that would be a very,
very bad thing.

38:06.965 --> 38:09.366
And the other thing
that makes it difficult

38:09.367 --> 38:13.037
is that the ignition level
is not very high,

38:13.038 --> 38:15.539
one volt at one amp.

38:15.540 --> 38:19.076
When you just walk around
in wool clothing,

38:19.077 --> 38:21.045
you could generate a static charge

38:21.046 --> 38:23.514
of upwards of 40,000 volts.

38:23.515 --> 38:26.450
So, that's why we have to remove

38:26.451 --> 38:28.752
anything that's not cotton
and ground ourselves

38:28.753 --> 38:30.888
because we don't want
these things going off.

38:30.889 --> 38:32.589
Narrator: Yep, they're staying grounded

38:32.590 --> 38:34.358
'cause the power of these rockets

38:34.359 --> 38:36.861
could knock more than their socks off.

38:36.862 --> 38:40.597
To send this pylon down
the track at 200 miles an hour,

38:40.598 --> 38:42.399
we are using vintage, Korean-war,

38:42.400 --> 38:44.601
high-velocity aircraft motors.

38:44.602 --> 38:47.471
That's gonna give us
the 200 miles an hour we need,

38:47.472 --> 38:52.476
375 G's, and 12,000 pounds of thrust.

38:52.477 --> 38:55.112
It's gonna annihilate
the <i>mythity split 3.</i>

38:55.113 --> 38:56.180
Narrator: Indeed.

38:56.181 --> 38:57.481
That pylon will be traveling

38:57.482 --> 39:01.118
at the maximum speed
a super-fast speedboat can go,

39:01.119 --> 39:03.254
which means there's no margin for error.

39:03.255 --> 39:04.856
To the bunker.

39:04.857 --> 39:06.757
[ Grant laughs ]

39:08.160 --> 39:10.194
Okay. So, our high-speed cameras
are in place.

39:10.195 --> 39:11.528
We are ready to go.

39:11.529 --> 39:13.397
This is the moment of truth.

39:13.398 --> 39:15.032
What do I think is gonna happen?

39:15.033 --> 39:17.668
Look, that's a fiberglass boat.

39:17.669 --> 39:19.337
It's a steel pole coming at it.

39:19.338 --> 39:22.240
That thing is gonna shatter
into a million pieces.

39:22.241 --> 39:23.875
Mark my words.

39:23.876 --> 39:27.345
Narrator: Well, where the curse of
the bifurcated boat is involved,

39:27.346 --> 39:29.347
nothing is certain.

39:29.348 --> 39:32.083
But they've cleared the decks.

39:32.084 --> 39:35.353
All right, the pylon is loaded and hot.

39:35.354 --> 39:36.720
We've got our boat in place.

39:36.721 --> 39:37.989
Batten down the hatches.

39:37.990 --> 39:39.690
Tory: [ Normal voice ]
This is it, man.

39:39.691 --> 39:43.394
Finally, hopefully,
we can cut this boat in half.

39:43.395 --> 39:46.264
[ Siren blares ]
And now it's full steam ahead.

39:47.866 --> 39:52.569
All right.
Rocket-sled pylon versus boat.

39:52.570 --> 39:55.572
Three, two, one.

39:58.143 --> 39:59.476
Yeah!
[ Laughs ]

39:59.477 --> 40:00.677
Wow! We got bifurcation!

40:03.181 --> 40:05.049
It cut right down the middle!

40:05.050 --> 40:07.385
We did it finally!

40:07.386 --> 40:08.585
Ha-ha!
Awesome!

40:08.586 --> 40:10.321
That was awesome.

40:10.322 --> 40:12.656
Narrator: Yep, it seems
the curse has lifted,

40:12.657 --> 40:15.192
and they finally split the boat.

40:15.193 --> 40:18.262
Finally! After all this time,
we bifurcated a boat.

40:18.263 --> 40:20.464
But you know what that shows me?

40:20.465 --> 40:23.634
That dude had to be going fast.

40:23.635 --> 40:25.136
- Real fast.
- Yep.

40:27.372 --> 40:29.540
Let's go check out the carnage.

40:29.541 --> 40:30.841
All right.

40:34.079 --> 40:36.914
Narrator: Outside, it's clear
that this ship is wrecked.

40:36.915 --> 40:38.515
[ Laughs ]

40:38.516 --> 40:40.484
I cannot tell you how happy I am

40:40.485 --> 40:42.253
that this boat is finally split.

40:42.254 --> 40:43.821
It split in two.

40:43.822 --> 40:46.690
I mean, it's annihilated,
but there is a clear division.

40:46.691 --> 40:47.691
[ Imitates explosion ]

40:47.692 --> 40:50.227
The rocket sled does not disappoint.

40:50.228 --> 40:53.097
Narrator: It does not.

40:53.098 --> 40:58.035
Reaching 200 miles per hour
in only 200 feet,

40:58.036 --> 41:01.138
the rocket-powered pylon
plowed into the prow,

41:01.139 --> 41:02.739
tossing the boat into the air

41:02.740 --> 41:07.411
and leaving two halves in its wake.

41:07.412 --> 41:09.113
Grant: All right, so, my prediction

41:09.114 --> 41:10.982
was that when
the channel marker hit the boat,

41:10.983 --> 41:13.384
it would shatter into a million pieces.

41:13.385 --> 41:16.253
But as you can see here,
it actually tore a hole

41:16.254 --> 41:18.456
almost all the way down the hull,

41:18.457 --> 41:21.225
leaving this in two
pretty-much-intact halves.

41:21.226 --> 41:24.695
I've never been happier
to say that I was wrong.

41:24.696 --> 41:25.963
And it just goes to show

41:25.964 --> 41:29.066
that even a blunt object
like our channel marker

41:29.067 --> 41:32.370
could turn into a knife
when you add enough speed.

41:32.371 --> 41:36.640
Kari: There's no way that guy
was going 25 miles an hour.

41:36.641 --> 41:38.775
We tried it over and over at 25.

41:38.776 --> 41:41.145
We tried it off water, on water.

41:41.146 --> 41:45.449
It took 200
before it started to split it.

41:45.450 --> 41:48.552
We didn't even get a dent at 25.

41:48.553 --> 41:51.455
I think he might have been lying.

41:52.991 --> 41:54.492
Tory: [ Deep voice ]
Seven years in the making,

41:54.493 --> 41:59.897
four channel markers, three
boats, a barge, and a crane,

41:59.898 --> 42:03.200
but nothing could bifurcate the boat

42:03.201 --> 42:09.040
until now... With a rocket-powered sled.

42:09.041 --> 42:12.944
But it looks like
this one's still busted.

42:17.020 --> 42:19.262
That was fun.

42:19.287 --> 42:21.645
What do you think we could
put on the rocket sled next?

42:21.670 --> 42:24.097
- I don't know.
- Maybe a bus.

42:24.122 --> 42:26.122
Uhhh.
