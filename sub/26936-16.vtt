WEBVTT

00:00.870 --> 00:02.420
Tonight on The Curse

00:02.420 --> 00:03.420
of Oak Island...

00:03.420 --> 00:05.169
28 feet of water, lads!

00:05.169 --> 00:06.229
These are targets

00:06.229 --> 00:07.229
that we've identified.

00:07.229 --> 00:09.010
I don't think that's a rock.

00:09.010 --> 00:10.929
There it is!

00:10.929 --> 00:12.150
Finally, we've exposed

00:12.150 --> 00:13.940
the entire slipway structure.

00:13.940 --> 00:15.110
It's the biggest mystery,
isn't it?

00:15.110 --> 00:16.250
They want to keep things secret.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.520
Ooh! Look at that!
That looks like

00:18.520 --> 00:21.010
it's off
a substantial treasure chest.

00:21.010 --> 00:23.260
- Hello!
-We're gonna find out

00:23.260 --> 00:25.890
from a blacksmith
how old the hinge is.

00:25.890 --> 00:27.150
That is early 1600s.

00:27.150 --> 00:29.880
This could be pre-Money Pit.

00:29.880 --> 00:32.929
There is an island

00:32.929 --> 00:35.210
in the North Atlantic

00:35.210 --> 00:38.079
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.079 --> 00:41.480
for more than 200 years.

00:41.480 --> 00:44.789
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.789 --> 00:48.170
with strange symbols carved
into it,

00:48.170 --> 00:50.750
mysterious fragments
of human bone,

00:50.750 --> 00:54.429
and a lead cross whose origin
may stretch back

00:54.429 --> 00:57.210
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:57.210 --> 01:01.920
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

01:01.920 --> 01:05.400
And, according to legend,

01:05.400 --> 01:08.020
one more will have to die

01:08.120 --> 01:11.480
before the treasure
can be found.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074

01:36.280 --> 01:39.850
Let's get Craig on the phone.

01:39.850 --> 01:43.130
 It is the start
of another day on Oak Island...

01:43.130 --> 01:45.480
-Hi, guys.
-ALL: Hey, Craig.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.030
...as brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina,

01:48.030 --> 01:50.500
along with other members
of their team,

01:50.500 --> 01:52.210
have arranged to meet
with their partner,

01:52.210 --> 01:54.550
Craig Tester,
via video conference.

01:54.550 --> 01:57.640
So, we're wanting
to talk about the dye tests.

01:57.640 --> 01:59.820
Okay.
-Um, here's what happened,

01:59.820 --> 02:00.820
okay?

02:00.820 --> 02:03.040
We pumped somewhere between
maybe a quarter million

02:03.040 --> 02:04.600
and half a million gallons.

02:04.600 --> 02:06.500
The biggest surprise was

02:06.500 --> 02:10.590
we saw seepage
down in Smith's Cove,

02:10.590 --> 02:13.420
which definitely turned
rusty-colored.

02:13.420 --> 02:14.959
Wow.

02:14.959 --> 02:17.769
One day ago,

02:17.769 --> 02:20.159
Rick, Marty and the team

02:20.159 --> 02:22.409
conducted what is known
as a dye test

02:22.409 --> 02:24.459
in order to find out

02:24.459 --> 02:27.390
if the man-made flood tunnels
believed to exist

02:27.390 --> 02:30.670
at Smith's Cove
could still be directly traced

02:30.670 --> 02:32.879
to the Money Pit
treasure vault.

02:32.879 --> 02:33.879
Let's do this.

02:33.879 --> 02:37.260
After pumping thousands
of gallons of seawater

02:37.260 --> 02:40.870
mixed with nontoxic red dye
into the C-1 shaft...

02:40.870 --> 02:43.379
MARTY (over radio):
The dye has been cast.

02:43.379 --> 02:45.549
...metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

02:45.549 --> 02:48.639
spotted what appeared
to be red-colored water...

02:48.639 --> 02:52.999
If we're looking for red, guys,
I'd say that's red.

02:52.999 --> 02:54.750
...water which, when analyzed,

02:54.750 --> 02:58.079
tested positive
for traces of the red dye.

02:58.079 --> 02:59.120
11.98.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.170
That's a good
positive indication.

03:01.170 --> 03:02.170
Yeah!

03:02.170 --> 03:03.860
All the rocks

03:03.860 --> 03:06.099
turned, like,
an orangey-brown color

03:06.099 --> 03:09.560
wherever the water
flowed over the rocks.

03:09.560 --> 03:12.810
It was never flowing
like that before,

03:12.810 --> 03:15.629
and I never saw that color
in that area.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.730
So, that was interesting start
to the pumping.

03:18.730 --> 03:22.859
Well, it's consistent with
a flood tunnel that's plugged.

03:22.859 --> 03:26.140
And maybe, you know, pumping in
caused them to silt up.

03:26.140 --> 03:28.680
Maybe there's something
under the pad.

03:28.680 --> 03:30.200
Structures or a tunnel.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.279
I think there is something
under the crane pad.

03:33.279 --> 03:35.879
In order to construct

03:35.879 --> 03:39.819
the massive
525-foot-wide steel cofferdam

03:39.819 --> 03:42.180
that now surrounds
Smith's Cove,

03:42.180 --> 03:44.040
the Laginas and their partners

03:44.040 --> 03:46.569
hired the team
from Irving Equipment Limited

03:46.569 --> 03:49.519
to build a 6,000-square-foot
wooden pad

03:49.519 --> 03:50.810
capable of supporting

03:50.810 --> 03:54.790
the weight and movement
of a 300-ton crane.

03:54.790 --> 03:57.319
But now,
although the excavation efforts

03:57.319 --> 04:00.599
at Smith's Cove
have been hugely successful,

04:00.599 --> 04:03.730
the team must deal
with an unintended consequence

04:03.730 --> 04:04.930
of their operation.

04:04.930 --> 04:09.459
The crane pad is most likely
built directly over the spot

04:09.459 --> 04:12.810
that Rick and Marty
have been most eager to find,

04:12.810 --> 04:15.980
the convergence point
where the stone box drains meet

04:15.980 --> 04:19.478
on their way to the original
Oak Island Money Pit.

04:19.478 --> 04:21.410
But you mess around

04:21.410 --> 04:22.410
with that crane pad,

04:22.410 --> 04:23.840
and Irving's gonna want
to do it,

04:23.840 --> 04:26.460
because they're gonna
want it all done to their specs.

04:26.460 --> 04:29.550
Yeah. Marty's point is
we need to talk to them.

04:29.550 --> 04:31.020
The larger context is,

04:31.020 --> 04:33.389
what do we do in Smith's Cove
at this point?

04:33.389 --> 04:35.690
Do we dig at the crane pad,
yes or no?

04:35.690 --> 04:37.550
Craig, what do you want to do?

04:37.550 --> 04:39.479
I-I really want
to pursue it, uh,

04:39.479 --> 04:42.759
and try to get everything
in Smith's Cove done this year.

04:42.759 --> 04:44.910
Um, I really like
going under the pad.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.610
I know it's a pain, but, um,

04:47.610 --> 04:50.120
you know, following that water,

04:50.120 --> 04:52.530
follow it while we can, while
we got the cofferdam in place.

04:52.530 --> 04:55.960
The point is,
we're not done in Smith's Cove.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.610
I think we all will agree
with that, Rick.

04:58.610 --> 05:00.310
Although Rick, Marty

05:00.310 --> 05:01.310
and the team

05:01.310 --> 05:03.600
are eager to verify
if they have found

05:03.600 --> 05:05.360
the main flood tunnel
that links

05:05.360 --> 05:06.990
to the Money Pit
treasure vault,

05:06.990 --> 05:08.210
they must first

05:08.210 --> 05:10.290
obtain additional
environmental permits

05:10.290 --> 05:11.750
from the Canadian government

05:11.750 --> 05:13.990
to expand
their excavation efforts.

05:13.990 --> 05:15.650
They will also need

05:15.650 --> 05:17.940
an extension
on their existing permit

05:17.940 --> 05:20.440
to keep
the massive cofferdam in place.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.180
In Smith's Cove,

05:22.180 --> 05:23.979
you have to deal with all kinds

05:23.979 --> 05:26.090
of governmental
oversight agencies--

05:26.090 --> 05:27.810
Department of Fisheries
and Oceans,

05:27.810 --> 05:28.990
Department of Environment.

05:28.990 --> 05:33.280
And we have long sought
and worked laboriously

05:33.280 --> 05:35.432
to make certain
-That's right.

05:35.432 --> 05:38.849
that we have respect
for the environment.

05:38.849 --> 05:41.310
We are going to figure out a way
to move this crane pad

05:41.310 --> 05:43.569
and dig underneath it.

05:43.569 --> 05:46.260
The more we dig,
the more we discover.

05:46.260 --> 05:48.570
So let's just continue digging
and,

05:48.570 --> 05:50.699
hopefully, we get lucky.

05:50.699 --> 05:55.180
So let's go make it so.

05:55.180 --> 05:59.159
Following their morning meeting

05:59.159 --> 06:00.350
in the war room,

06:00.350 --> 06:04.139
Rick, Marty and Dave
arrive at Smith's Cove.

06:04.139 --> 06:05.800
We're gonna go talk to Billy

06:05.800 --> 06:09.069
about the process there.
 Go talk to Billy. Fine.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.500
Although the team
has made a number

06:10.500 --> 06:12.919
of significant discoveries
at Smith's Cove

06:12.919 --> 06:15.069
during the past eight weeks,

06:15.069 --> 06:19.669
the time to finish excavating
the area is running short.

06:19.669 --> 06:21.760
Summer is almost over,

06:21.760 --> 06:23.800
and the permits
that Marty and Rick obtained

06:23.800 --> 06:26.539
from the government
in order to build the cofferdam

06:26.539 --> 06:27.810
are set to expire.

06:27.810 --> 06:29.740
Even if the team obtains

06:29.740 --> 06:31.770
the necessary permissions
to dig up

06:31.770 --> 06:34.710
the crane pad,
they will have to move quickly

06:34.710 --> 06:37.389
if they intend to do
a thorough search of the area

06:37.389 --> 06:39.680
for important artifacts
and clues.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.819
We've certainly set out

06:41.819 --> 06:44.509
to uncover the secrets
of Smith's Cove.

06:44.509 --> 06:47.430
Now it's time to get to work to
try to come to an understanding

06:47.430 --> 06:49.759
as to what
these structures represent.

06:49.759 --> 06:52.410
Oh! Hey!

06:52.410 --> 06:55.949
(excavator engine shuts off)

06:55.949 --> 06:56.949
Okay.

06:56.949 --> 06:59.620
The first question is,
what do you got to do here?

06:59.620 --> 07:02.370
The objective is to get as close
as we can to the...

07:02.370 --> 07:04.530
to the slipway with the machine

07:04.530 --> 07:07.919
and then clean it off by hand.
Right.

07:07.919 --> 07:11.479
After building a massive

07:11.479 --> 07:12.949
525-foot-wide cofferdam

07:12.949 --> 07:15.900
and draining a large area
of Smith's Cove,

07:15.900 --> 07:18.250
the Oak Island team
has unearthed

07:18.250 --> 07:19.780
a number of mysterious

07:19.780 --> 07:22.960
and previously undocumented
structures.

07:22.960 --> 07:26.509
What is it?
-It's concrete.

07:26.509 --> 07:28.710
In addition to a concrete wall,

07:28.710 --> 07:32.280
they have uncovered evidence
of a stone box drain

07:32.280 --> 07:35.819
and remnants of
an ancient wharf, or slipway,

07:35.819 --> 07:38.040
which was previously discovered
by treasure hunter

07:38.040 --> 07:42.300
Gilbert Hedden in 1936.

07:42.300 --> 07:43.520
Let's stay focused on this.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.919
Billy thinks a couple shovelers
here helping Laird,

07:46.919 --> 07:49.849
dig this down
and then blade this off.

07:49.849 --> 07:52.759
Get it nice and level.
Okay. Great.

07:52.759 --> 07:53.999
Let's go.

07:53.999 --> 07:56.000
The reason why I wanted

07:56.000 --> 07:58.569
to do Smith's Cove in
the first place was to answer

07:58.569 --> 08:00.490
the questions of who and when.

08:00.490 --> 08:02.509
And I think
there are some clues,

08:02.509 --> 08:06.139
hopefully, that reside
within this slipway structure.

08:06.139 --> 08:07.469
(beeping)

08:07.469 --> 08:12.379
I got an hit here, Jack.

08:12.379 --> 08:13.379
(sustained beep)

08:13.379 --> 08:17.290
It's iron,
and it's reading four inches.

08:17.290 --> 08:24.303
Hang on, mate.
I think I saw it.

08:24.303 --> 08:25.303
No, not in there.

08:25.303 --> 08:26.303
JACK: Pretty sure that... Oh.
-Ooh!

08:26.303 --> 08:34.360
That's a beauty.

08:34.360 --> 08:35.639
This looks hand-forged.

08:35.639 --> 08:37.110
This looks old.

08:37.110 --> 08:41.750
This freaking reminds me
of some kind of, like,

08:41.750 --> 08:44.750
a spear point.

08:44.750 --> 08:47.350
This looks like
a projectile of some kind.

08:47.350 --> 08:50.240
Like a spear tip?

08:50.240 --> 08:52.050
Yeah, a spear tip.

08:52.050 --> 08:53.740
A spear tip?

08:53.740 --> 08:55.230
This is almost weapon-like.

08:55.230 --> 08:57.180
It was while metal detecting

08:57.180 --> 08:59.870
in this same area
four weeks ago

08:59.870 --> 09:04.000
that Gary discovered
a nearly identical object,

09:04.000 --> 09:05.380
which was strikingly similar

09:05.380 --> 09:09.370
to one found
on the island's southern shore.

09:09.370 --> 09:11.980
What it appears to be...

09:11.980 --> 09:12.980
is Roman.

09:12.980 --> 09:14.720
-No way!
No way.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.440
A possible Roman pilum,

09:17.440 --> 09:20.050
a spear point used
by Roman soldiers

09:20.050 --> 09:23.310
as far back
as the first century BC.

09:23.310 --> 09:25.889
I mean, we don't know.

09:25.889 --> 09:28.440
We don't know
how old these structures are,

09:28.440 --> 09:30.630
who made 'em,

09:30.630 --> 09:32.100
and, possibly,

09:32.100 --> 09:33.100
who protected 'em.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.410
I mean, look at that.
It looks like

09:35.410 --> 09:38.300
it was made like that
on purpose.

09:38.300 --> 09:40.110
I don't think this is
no fastener, mate.

09:40.110 --> 09:43.240
I think these are,
potentially, weapons.

09:43.240 --> 09:46.510
-Well, that wasn't
fastened into anything.

09:46.510 --> 09:47.510
Yeah.

09:47.510 --> 09:48.510
Laird!

09:48.510 --> 09:50.800
Check this out, mate!

09:50.800 --> 09:54.120
This was below
where the bottom of this log

09:54.120 --> 09:55.570
would be.
-Oh, right.

09:55.570 --> 09:59.180
-So it's a disturbed area? Yeah.
And... Yeah. Well...

09:59.180 --> 10:00.550
Why would anyone make something

10:00.550 --> 10:03.120
That tapers down like that?
-I don't know.

10:03.120 --> 10:05.440
I don't know why they'd create
a weak point right there.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.040
It reminds me of,

10:07.040 --> 10:08.120
like, a projectile.

10:08.120 --> 10:10.560
Like, a-a weapon of some kind.

10:10.560 --> 10:14.240
This is a really sweet find.

10:14.240 --> 10:17.610
More and more I'm starting to
think the slipway is really old.

10:17.610 --> 10:19.649
And if there's anything
in Smith's Cove

10:19.649 --> 10:22.120
that's original
from the depositors,

10:22.120 --> 10:23.329
it's the slipway.

10:23.329 --> 10:26.600
-It's certainly hand-forged.
- I just don't think

10:26.600 --> 10:27.850
these are tools.
Yeah.

10:27.850 --> 10:29.860
 But That looks
really old.

10:29.860 --> 10:30.860
LAIRD: Yeah.

10:30.860 --> 10:32.940
I think we've got

10:32.940 --> 10:33.940
something interesting

10:33.940 --> 10:35.600
going on in this area.
Right.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.600
Yeah.

10:36.600 --> 10:37.600
There's only one way

10:37.600 --> 10:38.600
to find out.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.010
Yeah. Find some more.

10:40.010 --> 10:46.600
While Gary, Jack and the team

10:46.600 --> 10:48.980
continue to investigate
the mysterious slipway

10:48.980 --> 10:50.060
at Smith's Cove...

10:50.060 --> 10:51.240
-Hi, Vanessa!
How you doing today?

10:51.240 --> 10:53.410
...brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina,

10:53.410 --> 10:57.240
along with Dave Blankenship,
head to the Money Pit area

10:57.240 --> 10:58.760
to meet with representatives

10:58.760 --> 11:00.220
of Irving Equipment Limited.

11:00.220 --> 11:03.080
The plan for today is
to get H-8 leveled,

11:03.080 --> 11:06.510
put the falsework in place,
crane mats in place,

11:06.510 --> 11:08.850
Get things bolted up.
VANESSA: I think We pushed H-8

11:08.850 --> 11:11.130
as far as We can safely.
 Been a lot

11:11.130 --> 11:12.310
of stuff down here.

11:12.310 --> 11:13.389
Exactly. Exactly.
Yeah.

11:13.389 --> 11:14.470
We're obviously antsy,

11:14.470 --> 11:20.702
but we know
you got to do it right.

11:20.702 --> 11:21.702
I don't know
what the heck that is.

11:21.702 --> 11:22.702
Oh, that's... pottery.

11:22.702 --> 11:23.702
Two weeks ago, while excavating

11:23.702 --> 11:24.702
the borehole known as H-8,

11:24.702 --> 11:26.850
the borehole
that Marty Lagina believed

11:26.850 --> 11:28.510
was most likely on the site

11:28.510 --> 11:31.050
of the original
Money Pit treasure shaft...

11:31.050 --> 11:37.389
...the ground surrounding the
50-inch-wide drilling caisson

11:37.389 --> 11:41.540
began to suddenly
and mysteriously collapse.

11:41.540 --> 11:43.959
Although the team
from Irving Equipment Limited

11:43.959 --> 11:46.889
was able to stabilize
the massive sinkhole

11:46.889 --> 11:49.580
using a powerful
vibro hammer tool,

11:49.580 --> 11:53.690
the site is now considered
too unstable and too unsafe

11:53.690 --> 11:56.420
to continue excavating.

11:56.420 --> 11:57.620
It's full stop.

11:57.620 --> 12:01.339
Uh, again, frustrating, 'cause
H-8 was giving up some data.

12:01.339 --> 12:02.700
No, incredibly frustrating.

12:02.700 --> 12:05.870
I mean, we may not
be done with H-8,

12:05.870 --> 12:08.480
but we may be done this year.

12:08.480 --> 12:11.140
Unfortunately.
It's unsafe.

12:11.140 --> 12:13.070
Doesn't mean
we can't move forward.

12:13.070 --> 12:15.149
Doesn't mean we can't
be successful.

12:15.149 --> 12:17.830
Determined to continue,

12:17.830 --> 12:19.639
the Laginas and their partners

12:19.639 --> 12:23.190
have decided to return to one
of their earlier strategies.

12:23.190 --> 12:25.990
They will attempt to reach
the Money Pit treasure vault

12:25.990 --> 12:29.639
by means of an adjacent tunnel,
Shaft Six.

12:29.639 --> 12:34.440
Well, I have high hopes
for the first site.

12:34.440 --> 12:37.269
Shaft Six has always been,
uh, important to me.

12:37.269 --> 12:39.800
I think I've
somewhat convinced these two.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.800
He's certain there's
gonna be something there,

12:41.800 --> 12:43.910
which makes it...

12:43.910 --> 12:45.970
-You've set yourself
a tough course, big brother.

12:45.970 --> 12:46.970
I know I have.

12:46.970 --> 12:48.680
And I think if there's anything
to be found in the Money Pit,

12:48.680 --> 12:50.020
it's in that shaft.

12:50.020 --> 12:52.100
CHARLES:
Uh-oh, that's wood.

12:52.100 --> 12:54.170
11 weeks ago,

12:54.170 --> 12:55.639
while conducting an extensive

12:55.639 --> 12:57.910
core-drilling operation
in the area,

12:57.910 --> 13:01.820
the team found evidence of
a 19th-century searcher tunnel

13:01.820 --> 13:03.720
that was dug
in a failed attempt

13:03.720 --> 13:06.949
to enter the original
Money Pit from below.

13:06.949 --> 13:10.360
I think we're right on target
for that tunnel.

13:10.360 --> 13:15.100
How specific do you need,
in terms of the location?

13:15.100 --> 13:16.100
How specific?

13:16.100 --> 13:18.300
If we know approximately
within a couple of feet,

13:18.300 --> 13:20.890
at this point, uh,
just to get the pad prepped.

13:20.890 --> 13:22.899
-All right, well,
let's let him get to work.

13:22.899 --> 13:23.899
Yep.

13:23.899 --> 13:24.930
-All right,
have a good day, guys.

13:24.930 --> 13:25.930
 Thank you.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.690
 See you later.
DAVE: Yep.

13:27.690 --> 13:28.690
(wind whistling)

13:28.690 --> 13:29.829
Before another day ends

13:29.829 --> 13:31.760
on Oak Island...

13:31.760 --> 13:34.540
Tony, welcome back

13:34.540 --> 13:36.570
to the war room. Yeah.
-Thanks, buddy.

13:36.570 --> 13:40.089
...Rick and Marty Lagina
join members of the team,

13:40.089 --> 13:42.850
along with professional diver
Tony Sampson,

13:42.850 --> 13:43.850
in the war room.

13:43.850 --> 13:45.680
They are eager to follow up

13:45.680 --> 13:47.459
on data they retrieved

13:47.459 --> 13:48.990
during a recent investigation

13:48.990 --> 13:50.850
of the island's southern shore

13:50.850 --> 13:54.480
that was conducted by the
Centre for Geographic Sciences,

13:54.480 --> 13:57.149
otherwise known as COGS.

13:57.149 --> 14:00.470
What we're gonna do here today
is we're gonna go over

14:00.470 --> 14:05.240
the offshore data that the
COGS students obtained for us,

14:05.240 --> 14:06.399
and they came up

14:06.399 --> 14:08.639
with some interesting stuff
on the seafloor.

14:08.639 --> 14:11.350
So Jack and Alex have
the data in front of them.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.810
Why don't you show Tony
what we got.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.600
Mm-hmm.
-Yeah. So, so, Tony,

14:14.600 --> 14:16.339
-we've got the data
on the screen there.

14:16.339 --> 14:17.339
Uh-huh.

14:17.339 --> 14:18.339
But there's a couple

14:18.339 --> 14:19.339
in particular

14:19.339 --> 14:20.750
that we're
especially interested in.

14:20.750 --> 14:22.639
 Okay.
-Jack, if you can pull up

14:22.639 --> 14:25.250
-the, uh, image of 12.
on it.

14:25.250 --> 14:29.150
-Oh, my God, that's interesting.
Right.

14:29.150 --> 14:30.550
Look at the shadow.

14:30.550 --> 14:32.709
Look at the jagged top
to that thing.

14:32.709 --> 14:33.950
And it's very skinny.

14:33.950 --> 14:35.750
I don't think that's a rock.

14:35.750 --> 14:36.750
Yeah.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.500
I think that's something

14:38.500 --> 14:40.170
sticking out of the seafloor.

14:40.170 --> 14:43.710
And anything sticking out
of the seafloor near Oak Island

14:43.710 --> 14:45.240
is worth a look.

14:45.240 --> 14:46.240
Yeah.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.250
In addition to finding

14:48.250 --> 14:50.339
what could be evidence
of a flood tunnel

14:50.339 --> 14:52.209
off the island's
southern shore...

14:52.209 --> 14:54.269
These two yellow columns

14:54.269 --> 14:56.080
are possible vent locations.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.350
...the scans also detected

14:58.350 --> 15:00.819
a number of possible
man-made objects

15:00.819 --> 15:02.959
on the ocean floor,

15:02.959 --> 15:05.180
including a mysterious
triangle formation

15:05.180 --> 15:09.240
that appeared to point
directly towards the Money Pit.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.899
That is clearly worth a dive.

15:11.899 --> 15:13.610
Yep.

15:13.610 --> 15:14.610
While the team waits

15:14.610 --> 15:16.230
for the government permits
they need

15:16.230 --> 15:19.519
in order to expand their
excavation of Smith's Cove,

15:19.519 --> 15:22.660
they will redirect their
efforts in hopes of locating

15:22.660 --> 15:26.279
what is believed to be
a second flood tunnel system,

15:26.279 --> 15:29.440
one that lies just off
the island's southern shore.

15:29.440 --> 15:32.560
I'm sure you've seen
a lot of strange things

15:32.560 --> 15:35.660
-on the sea bottom, right?
-Exactly, yeah.

15:35.660 --> 15:37.560
It's clearly an anomaly.

15:37.560 --> 15:41.759
Um, you probably know this,
but I'm just gonna say it.

15:41.759 --> 15:43.990
Those boulders sitting there
are not gonna be nice and clean.

15:43.990 --> 15:46.410
There's gonna be stuff
growing all over them.

15:46.410 --> 15:48.440
I mean, this feature
I find interesting,

15:48.440 --> 15:52.000
and only because, to me,
that looks like it lines up.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.240
PETER: the two rocks?
Yep.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.889
'Cause you could say that

15:54.889 --> 15:58.699
the two features
are the gunsight,

15:58.699 --> 16:02.760
and the rock is, like,
the end of your barrel.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.209
Yeah.
- So let's go

16:04.209 --> 16:06.889
to the next one.

16:06.889 --> 16:10.690
This is the possible anchor.

16:10.690 --> 16:12.750
Now, that's very interesting.

16:12.750 --> 16:14.290
And if you zoom in,

16:14.290 --> 16:15.290
you can see that there's

16:15.290 --> 16:19.120
a break in the shadow
between these two objects.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.120
Whoa.

16:20.120 --> 16:24.481
A boat anchor found
off the island

16:24.481 --> 16:26.330
could be
completely insignificant,

16:26.330 --> 16:28.790
or it could be very significant.

16:28.790 --> 16:30.920
It would matter whether
it was a boat anchor

16:30.920 --> 16:34.170
from a 1900s boat or a...

16:34.170 --> 16:35.170
late-1800s boat

16:35.170 --> 16:38.279
or, let's say, a 1600s boat.

16:38.279 --> 16:39.730
And so we have to have a look.

16:39.730 --> 16:42.460
I want to see
which of those it is.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.790
- If you find a feature,
Mm-hmm.

16:44.790 --> 16:47.500
I'd like to know
physical measurements, sizes...

16:47.500 --> 16:49.310
Yeah.
-...and really come up

16:49.310 --> 16:51.870
with an understanding
of what these things look like.

16:51.870 --> 16:54.029
Mm-hmm.
Well, take these guys with you.

16:54.029 --> 16:55.819
 Okay.
They both are certified divers.

16:55.819 --> 16:57.990
Okay. Well, with that in mind,
what we'll do, guys,

16:57.990 --> 17:00.420
is, with these anomalies,
we'll run a line, and then

17:00.420 --> 17:02.269
we can put an underwater compass
on the bottom,

17:02.269 --> 17:05.280
so you'll have hard numbers
as to where she is.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.400
Okay.
- Okay, this is good.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.030
We have a plan, a plan.

17:09.030 --> 17:11.020
We have the perfect people
to execute it.

17:11.020 --> 17:13.339
So let's come back
with some good data,

17:13.339 --> 17:14.390
and I'm happy.

17:14.390 --> 17:17.099
Let's go underwater.

17:17.099 --> 17:21.720
 It's the start
of another promising day

17:21.720 --> 17:25.579
on Oak Island, and as
archaeologist Laird Niven

17:25.579 --> 17:27.470
and members of the team

17:27.470 --> 17:28.860
continue their excavation

17:28.860 --> 17:31.970
of the mysterious slipway
in Smith's Cove...

17:31.970 --> 17:35.390
- Lock and load, buddy.
RYAN M.: Okay.

17:35.390 --> 17:37.669
...Alex Lagina, Peter Fornetti
and Jack Begley,

17:37.669 --> 17:40.900
along with professional diver
Tony Sampson,

17:40.900 --> 17:43.830
prepare for
an investigative dive operation

17:43.830 --> 17:46.690
in the waters
just off the southern shore.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.580
28 feet of water, lads!

17:48.580 --> 17:51.090
-51 degrees!
-The team's first target

17:51.090 --> 17:54.270
will be the mysterious
triangle-shaped formation,

17:54.270 --> 17:55.270
which appeared to point

17:55.270 --> 17:57.840
directly towards
the Oak Island Money Pit,

17:57.840 --> 17:59.700
and which the team believes

17:59.700 --> 18:03.380
may be associated with a second
man-made flood tunnel system,

18:03.380 --> 18:05.120
which, in turn, might lead

18:05.120 --> 18:08.020
directly to the Money Pit
treasure vault.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.780
Mark!

18:09.780 --> 18:11.610
In previous years,

18:11.610 --> 18:13.000
looking for things offshore

18:13.000 --> 18:15.650
was not a primary goal for us,

18:15.650 --> 18:16.820
because we needed information

18:16.820 --> 18:20.770
to point us to an "X marks
the spot" on the island.

18:20.770 --> 18:23.100
But now we need

18:23.100 --> 18:24.620
all the information we can get.

18:24.620 --> 18:27.020
And if it's offshore,

18:27.020 --> 18:28.120
it's offshore.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.600
Point us to something,
where to dig.

18:29.600 --> 18:30.600
Okay, so,

18:30.600 --> 18:31.650
what we have here, guys,

18:31.650 --> 18:34.350
in the bag, we have the compass
so we can get Marty's point

18:34.350 --> 18:37.780
and his orientation towards
the Money Pit or wherever else.

18:37.780 --> 18:40.789
Great.
Got it?

18:40.789 --> 18:42.799
Yep.
Excellent.

18:42.799 --> 18:44.330
We're not just

18:44.330 --> 18:45.330
checking these things out

18:45.330 --> 18:46.550
for the sake of doing it.

18:46.550 --> 18:48.020
Theories are numerous
on the island,

18:48.020 --> 18:49.679
and many of them include
underwater features.

18:49.679 --> 18:51.220
So the hope,
obviously, is to find

18:51.220 --> 18:53.450
some of these features,
or something, and hopefully,

18:53.450 --> 18:54.450
we'll have
our next breakthrough.

18:54.450 --> 18:56.860
Okay, the terminals
are both hooked up.

18:56.860 --> 18:59.310
-The container's back together.
 Fantastic.

18:59.310 --> 19:00.780
While Tony Sampson

19:00.780 --> 19:01.890
and Alex Lagina

19:01.890 --> 19:03.630
perform their dive,

19:03.630 --> 19:06.370
Peter Fornetti will maintain
continuous communication

19:06.370 --> 19:08.560
with them from the boat.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.210
Should either diver
need assistance

19:10.210 --> 19:13.130
during the operation,
Jack Begley--

19:13.130 --> 19:15.570
who is also
a certified scuba diver--

19:15.570 --> 19:18.610
will be ready
to enter the water.

19:18.610 --> 19:27.850
Are you guys ready?

19:27.850 --> 19:34.320
Surface to diver. Over.

19:34.320 --> 19:40.270
Despite the fact

19:40.270 --> 19:42.309
that Alex and Tony

19:42.309 --> 19:44.760
have seen the anomaly
on a sonar scan,

19:44.760 --> 19:47.740
they may have great difficulty
actually finding it

19:47.740 --> 20:01.840
due to the heavy vegetation
covering the ocean floor.

20:01.840 --> 20:12.940
Although the team

20:12.940 --> 20:14.630
is permitted to search for

20:14.630 --> 20:17.540
and recover treasure
on Oak Island,

20:17.540 --> 20:19.370
provincial laws prohibit
the removal

20:19.370 --> 20:23.150
of any artifacts
from the surrounding waters.

20:23.150 --> 20:25.740
Even so much as touching
or disturbing one

20:25.740 --> 20:29.790
is against the law.

20:29.790 --> 20:32.150
While Tony and Alex
continue their search

20:32.150 --> 20:34.870
in the waters off
the island's southern shore,

20:34.870 --> 20:37.590
at the Oak Island
Research Center,

20:37.590 --> 20:40.740
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina,
along with other members

20:40.740 --> 20:42.250
of the team...
 Steve.

20:42.250 --> 20:43.250
Hi.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.360
...have arranged to meet

20:44.360 --> 20:46.850
with professional surveyor
Steve Guptill.

20:46.850 --> 20:50.190
They are hoping that Steve,
using maps

20:50.190 --> 20:53.510
and more than 100 years
of notes and surveys,

20:53.510 --> 20:57.059
can help them pinpoint the
exact location and orientation

20:57.059 --> 20:59.660
of the Shaft Six tunnel.

20:59.660 --> 21:02.840
Although Rick believes the team
located it 11 weeks ago...

21:02.840 --> 21:05.130
I think he hit
the tunnel from Shaft Six.

21:05.130 --> 21:09.070
...he is concerned that if
any new excavation is off,

21:09.070 --> 21:11.779
even by a few feet,
they will miss finding

21:11.779 --> 21:14.740
the Money Pit's
underground treasure vault.

21:14.740 --> 21:17.760
I'm not sure if Doug
has filled you in,

21:17.760 --> 21:18.940
at least a little bit about,

21:18.940 --> 21:21.070
-you know, the basics.
-Well, a little bit.

21:21.070 --> 21:23.029
Yeah. We've got all
of these data sets

21:23.029 --> 21:24.900
from the different decades
of treasure hunters

21:24.900 --> 21:28.570
and researchers, and Dan is
really interested in the idea

21:28.570 --> 21:30.870
of bringing them ALL together.
-Yeah, it's all possible.

21:30.870 --> 21:32.809
I think you guys have
some depths, as well, right?

21:32.809 --> 21:35.120
So what I can do is, I can take
these images over the years,

21:35.120 --> 21:37.860
and I can lay them on their...
each on a separate layer.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.730
And eventually,
when we get the data overlaid

21:39.730 --> 21:42.320
and it's geo-referenced
properly, um,

21:42.320 --> 21:44.351
we can make it so we can start
putting the depths in

21:44.351 --> 21:48.549
and we can see the drill paths.

21:48.549 --> 21:49.919
Might you find out,
in this process,

21:49.919 --> 21:51.740
-that the surveys don't tie?
That happens.

21:51.740 --> 21:53.420
Yeah.
it can still be done.

21:53.420 --> 21:54.960
We just have to find other...

21:54.960 --> 21:57.440
So, what I would do from
that point, I'd look for trees,

21:57.440 --> 21:59.559
-buildings, landmarks.
Okay.

21:59.559 --> 22:01.380
Yeah.
- I think it's

22:01.380 --> 22:02.380
gonna be helpful

22:02.380 --> 22:04.200
as we carry it out
into the field.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.920
Yeah, I would love
to find Shaft Number Six.

22:06.920 --> 22:09.600
Well, find Six,
and we'll dig it.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.419
The overlay will assist

22:11.419 --> 22:14.130
in determining
the location of Shaft Six,

22:14.130 --> 22:16.309
because the early data is all

22:16.309 --> 22:20.299
about shafts
numbered one through seven,

22:20.299 --> 22:21.500
or one through eight,

22:21.500 --> 22:27.830
but if you establish where
eight, four, three and two are,

22:27.830 --> 22:29.760
you'll know exactly
where Six is.

22:29.760 --> 22:32.291
It's doable,
and that's the thing.

22:32.291 --> 22:33.291
You know, and I think
it's gonna bear fruit.

22:33.291 --> 22:34.850
STEVE G.:
Yeah, it sounds interesting,

22:34.850 --> 22:35.850
sounds fun.

22:35.850 --> 22:36.850
And, we're on
a treasure hunt here.

22:36.850 --> 22:37.850
-Let's go.
(laughter)

22:37.850 --> 22:39.620
As Rick and Marty conclude

22:39.620 --> 22:41.039
their meeting
with Steve Guptill...

22:41.039 --> 22:47.520
...Alex Lagina and Tony Sampson

22:47.520 --> 22:49.200
believe they may have finally

22:49.200 --> 22:51.940
located the mysterious
triangular formation

22:51.940 --> 23:10.840
in the waters
off the southern shore.

23:10.840 --> 23:29.929
The fact that Alex and Tony

23:29.929 --> 23:33.090
have confirmed that
the rock formation does point

23:33.090 --> 23:35.860
in the direction of
the Money Pit is significant.

23:35.860 --> 23:39.679
It suggests that it might have
been deliberately placed here

23:39.679 --> 23:41.669
as some sort of marker,

23:41.669 --> 23:46.070
pointing the way to
the Oak Island treasure vault.

23:46.070 --> 23:52.100
Divers coming up.

23:52.100 --> 23:54.539
Mark!

23:54.539 --> 23:58.279
Shortly after completing

23:58.279 --> 24:00.320
their search for the mysterious

24:00.320 --> 24:02.039
triangle-shaped object
in the waters

24:02.039 --> 24:04.970
just off the southern shore
of Oak Island,

24:04.970 --> 24:08.340
Alex Lagina, Jack Begley
and Peter Fornetti,

24:08.340 --> 24:11.510
along with diver Tony Sampson
and his crew,

24:11.510 --> 24:13.929
are about to perform
a second dive

24:13.929 --> 24:16.580
in an attempt to locate
what they believe

24:16.580 --> 24:18.679
might be a ship's anchor.

24:18.679 --> 24:21.170
Okay, guys. As you can see,

24:21.170 --> 24:22.970
the weather's turned to crap,
so we're going

24:22.970 --> 24:24.110
to live-boat this one now.

24:24.110 --> 24:25.559
We'll just walk
straight off the bow

24:25.559 --> 24:28.350
and onto the buoy like now.
Sounds good.

24:28.350 --> 24:30.779
Okay. Let's kit up, guys.

24:30.779 --> 24:32.309
Because the weather conditions

24:32.309 --> 24:34.690
have made it difficult
to drop anchor,

24:34.690 --> 24:38.000
Captain Ryan Mosher will
strategically place the barge

24:38.000 --> 24:40.780
directly over the target area.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.710
This will allow Tony and Alex

24:42.710 --> 24:45.260
to enter the water
the safest way possible

24:45.260 --> 24:49.880
to search
for the mysterious object.

24:49.880 --> 25:09.309
 ALL ready?
- Yep, all set.

25:09.309 --> 25:25.970
Good luck, but be safe.

25:25.970 --> 25:31.520
(water gurgling)

25:31.520 --> 25:38.580
A rock?

25:38.580 --> 25:40.010
Is it possible that the object

25:40.010 --> 25:41.679
that appeared to be man-made

25:41.679 --> 25:47.120
is, in reality,
merely a natural formation?

25:47.120 --> 25:51.000
I think if you were sensitive

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
to disappointment,

25:52.000 --> 25:53.770
you would not be on Oak Island,

25:53.770 --> 25:54.770
but it's not discouraging.

25:54.770 --> 25:56.860
We had a list to look at.

25:56.860 --> 25:58.690
We got eyes on them.

25:58.690 --> 26:01.409
We still know more
than we did this morning.

26:01.409 --> 26:04.409
Good results, though?

26:04.409 --> 26:07.179
Uh...
Or just rocks?

26:07.179 --> 26:08.399
It was definitely a rock.

26:08.399 --> 26:09.830
it was not an anchor.
 Okay.

26:09.830 --> 26:11.340
Well, it was kind of

26:11.340 --> 26:12.340
interesting.

26:12.340 --> 26:13.340
We hit the bottom there to what

26:13.340 --> 26:15.659
we thought was gonna be
the anchor, and we ended up

26:15.659 --> 26:17.180
coming across, like, two rocks,

26:17.180 --> 26:18.380
-eh, Alex? Yeah.
Yeah.

26:18.380 --> 26:19.980
Although Tony and Alex

26:19.980 --> 26:21.730
are momentarily disappointed

26:21.730 --> 26:24.740
by what they found
during their dive,

26:24.740 --> 26:26.880
their earlier discovery
of a possible

26:26.880 --> 26:30.030
triangle-shaped stone marker
offers a compelling

26:30.030 --> 26:33.010
and potentially important clue,

26:33.010 --> 26:34.870
one which could lead
to the discovery

26:34.870 --> 26:38.520
of a second flood tunnel system
designed to protect

26:38.520 --> 26:41.149
the original
Money Pit treasure vault.

26:41.149 --> 26:42.960
There's more research

26:42.960 --> 26:45.900
that needs to be done
on the stone marker,

26:45.900 --> 26:47.950
because it looks like
it is actually pointing

26:47.950 --> 26:49.100
at the Money Pit.

26:49.100 --> 26:51.120
That's-that's kind of a success,
but I want to see

26:51.120 --> 26:54.180
where exactly
the compass bearing leads us.

26:54.180 --> 26:57.289
Great. Well, I'm gonna
get out of this and, uh,

26:57.289 --> 26:59.030
Get warmed up a little bit.
-Yeah, I don't blame you, buddy.

26:59.030 --> 27:00.360
Okay, mate.
You do that.

27:00.360 --> 27:01.429
Okay.
- Hey, Ryan?

27:01.429 --> 27:10.149
If you want to steam towards
the buoy buddy, we'll haul her.

27:10.149 --> 27:11.840
Okay.

27:11.840 --> 27:16.149
 the next day...
 Look at that.

27:16.149 --> 27:19.659
-Pretty cool, eh?
-CRAIG: Yeah, it is massive.

27:19.659 --> 27:21.279
...Marty Lagina

27:21.279 --> 27:22.470
and his business partner

27:22.470 --> 27:25.160
Craig Tester arrive
at Smith's Cove...

27:25.160 --> 27:26.940
Hey, guys. How are you?

27:26.940 --> 27:30.820
Good. You about got it?

27:30.820 --> 27:31.820
Pretty much. Pretty much done.

27:31.820 --> 27:34.480
So, pretty quick,
we'll be able to remove this,

27:34.480 --> 27:37.620
and then we can get over
to that stuff, and then we can

27:37.620 --> 27:39.100
-excavate here, is that right?
-Yeah, exactly.

27:39.100 --> 27:40.970
It's gonna be interesting
to get under it.

27:40.970 --> 27:42.779
Now that the entire slipway

27:42.779 --> 27:44.390
is exposed,

27:44.390 --> 27:47.110
archaeologist Laird Niven
will photograph

27:47.110 --> 27:50.809
and meticulously record
the details of the structure.

27:50.809 --> 27:53.470
The team will then
carefully disassemble it

27:53.470 --> 27:56.080
in order to search
the area beneath it

27:56.080 --> 27:58.400
for artifacts
or possible clues.

27:58.400 --> 28:01.240
and you can See it
on the other side?

28:01.240 --> 28:02.240
-Oh, yeah.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.230
Yeah?
-Yeah, at low tide,

28:04.230 --> 28:05.230
it's visible. Yep.

28:05.230 --> 28:06.230
Wow.
Yeah.

28:06.230 --> 28:07.230
It's pretty big for a slipway.

28:07.230 --> 28:08.230
Certainly,
the ones we're used to.

28:08.230 --> 28:09.280
For hauling... just hauling up
your little fishing boat,

28:09.280 --> 28:10.500
-it's a lot larger.
Yeah.

28:10.500 --> 28:11.730
And the other thing is,

28:11.730 --> 28:12.730
they're really too close.

28:12.730 --> 28:15.299
To haul a ship up, you only

28:15.299 --> 28:17.070
need one every three
or four feet.

28:17.070 --> 28:20.320
Yeah, but a cart full of gold,
you'd need 'em every...

28:20.320 --> 28:21.320
Right?
(LAIRD laughs)

28:21.320 --> 28:22.350
just to strengthen it?
Yes.

28:22.350 --> 28:24.029
'Cause it'd be...
the wheels would be

28:24.029 --> 28:25.870
way closer together and stuff.

28:25.870 --> 28:28.580
I guess my question is,

28:28.580 --> 28:29.580
why-why use a slipway

28:29.580 --> 28:31.409
as opposed to a wharf?

28:31.409 --> 28:32.809
You know,
there's some people that feel

28:32.809 --> 28:36.210
that they want to keep things
secret, so it's very low...

28:36.210 --> 28:37.720
It's a low, almost no profile.

28:37.720 --> 28:40.630
Is it possible that the slipway

28:40.630 --> 28:43.620
was actually
a sort of secret wharf,

28:43.620 --> 28:45.809
one used not
for the docking of ships,

28:45.809 --> 28:47.340
but rather as a ramp

28:47.340 --> 28:50.550
to offload something of value
onto Oak Island?

28:50.550 --> 28:53.570
And, if so,
what else might the team find

28:53.570 --> 28:56.590
buried underneath
this mysterious structure?

28:56.590 --> 28:58.320
The slipway is clearly

28:58.320 --> 29:00.170
a-a rather massive structure.

29:00.170 --> 29:01.720
It appears to be quite old.

29:01.720 --> 29:03.890
It doesn't have a lot
of iron in it.

29:03.890 --> 29:06.130
It clearly looks like
it was used

29:06.130 --> 29:09.590
to load or unload something
for this island.

29:09.590 --> 29:11.779
Well, a whole bunch
of somebodies thought

29:11.779 --> 29:13.290
this was really important.

29:13.290 --> 29:15.910
It's pretty much
the biggest mystery, isn't it?

29:15.910 --> 29:19.059
This massive undertaking down
here, and hardly any detritus.

29:19.059 --> 29:20.990
I mean...
and the majority of it

29:20.990 --> 29:21.990
is actually

29:21.990 --> 29:23.120
-coming from here,
as Gary suspected.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.130
-Right here, yeah.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.860
Well, it will be interesting

29:25.860 --> 29:27.350
to dig a little deeper here,

29:27.350 --> 29:29.600
See What you find.
- Yeah. No, absolutely.

29:29.600 --> 29:30.730
All right, well,

29:30.730 --> 29:31.850
let's keep going.

29:31.850 --> 29:33.809
ALL Right.
-Carry on, man.

29:33.809 --> 29:35.120
Talk to you later.

29:35.120 --> 29:37.269
As archaeologist Laird Niven

29:37.269 --> 29:41.030
begins to carefully dig
beneath the slipway area,

29:41.030 --> 29:43.110
(beeping)
metal detection expert

29:43.110 --> 29:46.350
Gary Drayton continues
to search the spoils

29:46.350 --> 29:49.030
for possible clues.

29:49.030 --> 29:50.580
(beep)

29:50.580 --> 29:52.130
(beeping)

29:52.130 --> 29:55.230
(loud beep)

29:55.230 --> 29:59.870
Here we go!

29:59.870 --> 30:02.970
Hmm. Interesting.

30:02.970 --> 30:10.720
That looks like an hinge.

30:10.720 --> 30:11.720
That looks like an oldie.

30:11.720 --> 30:12.720
What's an hinge doing down here?

30:12.720 --> 30:13.720
(wind whistling)

30:13.720 --> 30:21.830
That looks like an oldie.

30:21.830 --> 30:25.299
While searching through spoils

30:25.299 --> 30:28.100
recently taken
from Smith's Cove,

30:28.100 --> 30:30.940
metal detection expert
Gary Drayton has just made

30:30.940 --> 30:33.860
what could be
an important discovery.

30:33.860 --> 30:37.570
It's not gold,
but it's interesting.

30:37.570 --> 30:41.549
That looks like
an old wrought iron hinge.

30:41.549 --> 30:44.090
That is cool.

30:44.090 --> 30:49.700
What do you make of the iron?

30:49.700 --> 30:54.390
That's nice. I don't know
if it's off a door, a chest

30:54.390 --> 30:57.299
or whatever,
but that's a substantial

30:57.299 --> 30:59.549
hinge piece.
Pretty massive.

30:59.549 --> 31:01.029
-Yeah, it is.

31:01.029 --> 31:04.490
What I make of that is
that it's old.

31:04.490 --> 31:06.510
How many "verys"?

31:06.510 --> 31:09.090
I can give you at least
a couple of very, very olds.

31:09.090 --> 31:10.230
Really?
it might even be

31:10.230 --> 31:12.140
very, very, very old.

31:12.140 --> 31:13.179
Really?

31:13.179 --> 31:16.330
An iron hinge?

31:16.330 --> 31:18.140
Possibly from a chest?

31:18.140 --> 31:21.290
And found more than six feet
deep beneath the seabed?

31:21.290 --> 31:24.420
Could it have been part
of a container used

31:24.420 --> 31:26.159
to bring something
of great value

31:26.159 --> 31:28.490
onto Oak Island centuries ago?

31:28.490 --> 31:31.059
You imagine the pin
that went in there?

31:31.059 --> 31:33.059
I mean, that is cool.

31:33.059 --> 31:34.650
That is cool.

31:34.650 --> 31:37.679
Do you think that's
a square hole?

31:37.679 --> 31:38.679
It's tough to tell, isn't it?

31:38.679 --> 31:39.760
The way it's angled.

31:39.760 --> 31:41.870
'Cause this looks broken off
at the end here.

31:41.870 --> 31:42.870
Yeah.
So it...

31:42.870 --> 31:45.260
-Well, that has gone through...
it had to be

31:45.260 --> 31:46.390
at least this long.

31:46.390 --> 31:52.961
I mean that's a huge length
to put on even a chest.

31:52.961 --> 31:54.620
Looks like there's a little more
out there somewhere.

31:54.620 --> 31:56.159
Yeah.

31:56.159 --> 31:58.130
Something like this
really opens the door

31:58.130 --> 31:59.680
to finding something else.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.020
Yeah.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.590
Well, one thing's for sure,
we can bring this

32:03.590 --> 32:06.679
to Get compositional analysis
done on it.

32:06.679 --> 32:07.679
Yeah.

32:07.679 --> 32:08.679
The hinge Gary found

32:08.679 --> 32:09.679
was very interesting.

32:09.679 --> 32:11.220
It did look very old.

32:11.220 --> 32:14.049
I mean, the metal itself seemed
to be hammered

32:14.049 --> 32:17.110
at some point in time
in layers like that,

32:17.110 --> 32:20.590
so we can find experts
that might tell us, you know,

32:20.590 --> 32:23.240
what it was used for,
what time period it was used.

32:23.240 --> 32:25.029
So we just got to follow up
on that.

32:25.029 --> 32:27.480
All right, mate, I'll try
and find whatever...

32:27.480 --> 32:28.480
A-Associated with that.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.480
That's a pretty cool hinge.

32:29.480 --> 32:34.429
It is.

32:34.429 --> 32:41.409
The following morning,

32:41.409 --> 32:43.159
while the careful
investigation efforts

32:43.159 --> 32:46.740
at Smith's Cove continue,

32:46.740 --> 32:49.010
Marty Lagina and his son Alex,

32:49.010 --> 32:51.399
along with area historian,
Doug Crowell,

32:51.399 --> 32:54.240
head some 20 miles north
of Oak Island

32:54.240 --> 32:57.919
to the Ross Farm Museum,
located in the nearby town

32:57.919 --> 33:00.220
of New Ross, Nova Scotia.

33:00.220 --> 33:02.139
They have arranged to meet

33:02.139 --> 33:05.050
with blacksmithing expert
Carmen Legge.

33:05.050 --> 33:06.360
All right.

33:06.360 --> 33:07.660
-Hello!
-Hello, sir.

33:07.660 --> 33:09.400
-Hey, there.
-I'm Marty.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.860
Hi. Carmen Legge. How are you?
-Hi, Carmen. Pleasure.

33:11.860 --> 33:13.700
-Carmen, I'm Alex.
-Alex. I've met you before.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.500
Doug. How you doing again?
Good to See you.

33:15.500 --> 33:18.150
-Yeah, very good.
- So we've got some...

33:18.150 --> 33:21.130
pieces of metal-worked items,

33:21.130 --> 33:23.260
and we're wondering if you can
identify them

33:23.260 --> 33:25.960
or shed some light on their time
of manufacture.

33:25.960 --> 33:29.840
Let's do it.
Let's have a look.

33:29.840 --> 33:31.610
All right.

33:31.610 --> 33:34.559
(Marty, Alex and Doug laugh)

33:34.559 --> 33:36.330
It is.

33:36.330 --> 33:41.559
Yeah, this one
is really interesting.

33:41.559 --> 33:45.169
Hmm.

33:45.169 --> 33:59.539
There were several. These were
all found in Smith's Cove.

33:59.539 --> 34:17.800
So, for a shaft,
for sure, right?

34:17.800 --> 34:24.440
How about age on that, Carmen?

34:24.440 --> 34:32.940
I mean, any way to know?

34:32.940 --> 34:40.810
Crib spikes?

34:40.810 --> 34:44.699
Dating back as early
as the mid-1600s?

34:44.699 --> 34:47.280
Could they have been used in
the construction of the slipway

34:47.280 --> 34:50.810
that the team has recently
uncovered at Smith's Cove?

34:50.810 --> 34:53.080
The funny thing
about the crib spikes

34:53.080 --> 34:55.350
is that there were only
a few of them.

34:55.350 --> 34:58.550
I mean, if they were being
used, say, in the slipway,

34:58.550 --> 35:00.730
they would have been used
en masse.

35:00.730 --> 35:02.930
There would have been
a lot of them.

35:02.930 --> 35:21.280
But maybe there's a cribbing of
some sort we haven't found yet.

35:21.280 --> 35:33.000
hmm.
 this is the kind of thing

35:33.000 --> 35:35.030
you would use in-in,
like, a house, or a,

35:35.030 --> 35:39.720
you know, something like that,
right?

35:39.720 --> 35:44.060
Why did you think

35:44.060 --> 35:47.560
it was real old?

35:47.560 --> 35:48.590
Mm-hmm.

35:48.590 --> 35:49.620
Mm-hmm.

35:49.620 --> 35:52.710
What time period?

35:52.710 --> 35:54.770
Before 1800.

35:54.770 --> 36:06.070
At the

36:06.070 --> 36:07.330
Ross Farm Museum

36:07.330 --> 36:10.510
in the town of New Ross,
Nova Scotia,

36:10.510 --> 36:12.530
Marty Lagina, his son Alex,

36:12.530 --> 36:14.510
and historian Doug Crowell

36:14.510 --> 36:17.630
have just been informed
that the large metal hinge

36:17.630 --> 36:20.110
recently discovered
at Smith's Cove

36:20.110 --> 36:23.770
could date back as early
as the 17th century,

36:23.770 --> 36:26.190
more than 100 years before
the discovery

36:26.190 --> 36:30.390
of the Money Pit in 1795.

36:30.390 --> 36:33.780
Wow.

36:33.780 --> 36:38.000
(laughs) We have no idea.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.321
We know activity
took place there.

36:39.321 --> 36:41.390
Smith's Cove,
I'll just tell you, flat out,

36:41.390 --> 36:42.890
has just been
a complete mystery.

36:42.890 --> 36:45.110
The more we dig, the more we
don't understand what happened.

36:45.110 --> 36:46.450
There's a lot of stuff in there.

36:46.450 --> 36:53.930
Now We do. Now We do. (laughs)
(laughs) We do now.

36:53.930 --> 36:55.520
Yeah.

36:55.520 --> 36:57.900
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

36:57.900 --> 37:00.980
I'm going to vote flood gate.

37:00.980 --> 37:03.330
Is it possible that the team

37:03.330 --> 37:04.540
has found a piece

37:04.540 --> 37:07.660
of the fabled booby-trapped
flooding system,

37:07.660 --> 37:10.280
believed to be protecting
whatever lies buried

37:10.280 --> 37:12.200
deep in the Oak Island
Money Pit?

37:12.200 --> 37:13.760
Well, it's massive.

37:13.760 --> 37:17.600
There would have been several
of these, right?

37:17.600 --> 37:18.930
Probably? Yeah.

37:18.930 --> 37:20.960
Carmen Legge thought the hinge

37:20.960 --> 37:22.910
was very old, and then
he also thought the hinge

37:22.910 --> 37:25.590
supported something
very massive.

37:25.590 --> 37:27.190
Could be evidence of,

37:27.190 --> 37:29.390
and perhaps lead us to,
the flood tunnel.

37:29.390 --> 37:30.590
So, that's exciting.

37:30.590 --> 37:32.460
Carmen, this has been great.
Thank you very much.

37:32.460 --> 37:34.320
We learned a lot.
 We Got some more.

37:34.320 --> 37:38.070
-We'll be back.
- Yeah, we'll be back.

37:38.070 --> 37:42.010
-CARMEN: I'll be waiting.
 ALL Right.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.010
Following his

37:43.010 --> 37:44.010
informative meeting

37:44.010 --> 37:46.150
with blacksmithing expert
Carmen Legge...

37:46.150 --> 37:48.600
-Hey, guys. How you doing?
-Oh, Marty.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.450
...Marty Lagina
has arranged to meet

37:50.450 --> 37:52.560
with his brother Rick
and other members

37:52.560 --> 37:55.910
of the Oak Island team,
at the Mug and Anchor Pub

37:55.910 --> 37:58.200
in the nearby town
of Mahone Bay.

37:58.200 --> 37:59.880
Alex and I actually went

37:59.880 --> 38:00.880
to see a blacksmith,

38:00.880 --> 38:03.180
and the guys there
is Carmen Legge.

38:03.180 --> 38:04.240
Very, very knowledgeable.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.680
I loved the guy
right off the bat.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.330
I mean, he-he was great.

38:07.330 --> 38:10.140
Anyhow, couple of those things
you thought were weapons,

38:10.140 --> 38:12.330
he thought were crib spikes.
Oh.

38:12.330 --> 38:14.330
-What's a crib spike?
- Well, you get

38:14.330 --> 38:16.060
two pieces of a log,
and you're trying

38:16.060 --> 38:17.860
to put them together like this,

38:17.860 --> 38:20.280
you drive a crib spike
right down through the corner.

38:20.280 --> 38:22.680
like making a tunnel. Yeah.
 Yeah.

38:22.680 --> 38:24.080
Far as date goes, it was old.

38:24.080 --> 38:27.630
You know, looking
for that key date, uh,

38:27.630 --> 38:30.790
pre-1795, which is always
what I'm focused on.

38:30.790 --> 38:32.290
Yeah.
he thought it could be

38:32.290 --> 38:33.850
pre-Money Pit.

38:33.850 --> 38:37.660
This... again,
I thought wasn't much.

38:37.660 --> 38:39.032
You did. And so does he.

38:39.032 --> 38:43.460
This... is that famous hinge.

38:43.460 --> 38:46.510
Oh. The strap
or the hinge, yeah.

38:46.510 --> 38:49.160
Uh, he thought this was
the oldest piece in the bunch

38:49.160 --> 38:51.830
and was willing to say this
could easily be...

38:51.830 --> 38:52.931
it could be pre-Money Pit,

38:52.931 --> 38:56.570
and he thought it could be, uh,
quite a ways pre-Money Pit.

38:56.570 --> 38:58.580
How-how old at the oldest?

38:58.580 --> 39:00.530
-1795 is the Money Pit.
 Right.

39:00.530 --> 39:01.530
Yeah.

39:01.530 --> 39:03.270
He thought, easily,
into the 1600s.

39:03.270 --> 39:06.450
(chuckles)
-And he also said,

39:06.450 --> 39:08.530
look, this held something
substantial.

39:08.530 --> 39:11.410
he said this-this was...
as wide as it is.

39:11.410 --> 39:14.600
Yeah. He said this held
a two-inch,

39:14.600 --> 39:16.670
to two-and-a-half-inch piece
of something.

39:16.670 --> 39:20.750
It was a... you know, and when
he heard it was in Smith's Cove,

39:20.750 --> 39:22.260
he was... said, well,
it's hard to picture

39:22.260 --> 39:26.050
what sort of big door
would be down in a cove.

39:26.050 --> 39:27.640
Yeah.
Yeah. he was quite intrigued

39:27.640 --> 39:28.640
with it.

39:28.640 --> 39:30.870
I'm-I'm quite excited about it,
because he thought that,

39:30.870 --> 39:33.260
wow, this could be very, very,
very old, this one.

39:33.260 --> 39:35.200
We got some clues.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.960
I wouldn't be surprised
if these are a depositor.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.700
-Uh, ths one, for sure.

39:40.700 --> 39:41.700
Yeah.

39:41.700 --> 39:42.700
If it holds up

39:42.700 --> 39:43.700
and it really is that old,

39:43.700 --> 39:45.260
perhaps it could be original.

39:45.260 --> 39:46.960
And it's exciting, because

39:46.960 --> 39:50.500
I feel like we might be closing
in on the information hunt.

39:50.500 --> 39:52.080
I-I really do, with these dates

39:52.080 --> 39:54.310
and these things
we-we need to look into.

39:54.310 --> 39:56.430
I think we might figure out
what happened here.

39:56.430 --> 39:59.890
What it tells me is not only
we're making, you know,

39:59.890 --> 40:01.250
really substantial finds,

40:01.250 --> 40:03.530
but it's all about
the information hunt,

40:03.530 --> 40:06.270
and when you source someone
who really can give us,

40:06.270 --> 40:07.940
-you know, input...
Mm-hmm.

40:07.940 --> 40:09.770
...I-I think that's very,
very important.

40:09.770 --> 40:11.680
We need to continue
to cultivate,

40:11.680 --> 40:13.920
you know,
contacts like-like Carmen.

40:13.920 --> 40:16.260
Well, here's to the ancient
and venerable trade

40:16.260 --> 40:18.500
of blacksmithing.
DAVE: Agreed.

40:18.500 --> 40:19.980
May it help us find
the treasure.

40:19.980 --> 40:21.600
 Cheers to
the blacksmiths.

40:21.600 --> 40:22.670
 Cheers.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.230
After a week that began

40:24.230 --> 40:25.310
with dead ends

40:25.310 --> 40:28.500
and potentially
devastating setbacks,

40:28.500 --> 40:31.230
have the Laginas and
their partners finally found

40:31.230 --> 40:34.220
what they call "the one thing,"

40:34.220 --> 40:38.180
the indisputable evidence of
man-made activity on Oak Island

40:38.180 --> 40:42.400
prior to the discovery
of the Money Pit in 1795?

40:42.400 --> 40:44.900
But could something as simple

40:44.900 --> 40:48.760
as a crib spike, or a hinge,

40:48.760 --> 40:50.520
really be proof
that the slipway

40:50.520 --> 40:53.100
and other wooden structures
at Smith's Cove

40:53.100 --> 40:57.510
were put there, not by
searchers, but by depositors?

40:57.510 --> 41:00.610
If so, then what was deposited?

41:00.610 --> 41:04.570
A vast treasure of gold
and silver?

41:04.570 --> 41:06.560
Precious jewels?

41:06.560 --> 41:08.370
Priceless artifacts?

41:08.370 --> 41:12.620
Or was it something
completely different?

41:12.620 --> 41:13.930
Something so incredible

41:13.930 --> 41:18.500
that finding it
will change history forever?

41:18.500 --> 41:21.280
Next time on

41:21.280 --> 41:23.220
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:23.220 --> 41:24.450
We have a dozen survey plans.

41:24.450 --> 41:26.960
We now have an ability

41:26.960 --> 41:27.960
to overlay the surveys.

41:27.960 --> 41:29.470
Shaft Six is right here.

41:29.470 --> 41:31.280
Put your finger on the map,
big brother.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.190
We focused in
on the most likely spot

41:33.190 --> 41:35.100
in the Money Pit to find
some actual treasure.

41:35.100 --> 41:37.250
I think it's there. I really do.

41:37.250 --> 41:38.250
Ooh! There's a coin.

41:38.250 --> 41:40.250
No way.
this could be depositor.

41:40.250 --> 41:40.850
Those are some

41:40.850 --> 41:42.150
really big timbers.

41:42.150 --> 41:43.550
-Yeah, there we go.
- They're oak.

41:43.650 --> 41:45.850
Which would be the only oak
we've ever seen, underground.

41:45.950 --> 41:47.250
We must be near the Money Pit.

41:47.350 --> 41:51.553
That changes everything.
