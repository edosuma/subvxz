This check of yours is

Marge, I never read a

and I'm not going to start now.

Hey, a cartoon!

01:49.460 --> 01:51.590
Ain't it the truth?

01:51.660 --> 01:52.990
No, it's not
the truth, Homer.

01:53.060 --> 01:54.730
It's well-documented

01:54.790 --> 01:56.750
that women are
safer drivers than men.

01:56.830 --> 02:00.200
Aw Marge, cartoons don't have
any deep meaning.

02:00.270 --> 02:01.140
They're just stupid drawings

Who is that bookworm, Smithers?

02:19.620 --> 02:20.660
Homer Simpson, sir.

02:20.720 --> 02:23.320
Simpson, eh?
How very strange.

God forbid they would

02:39.970 --> 02:42.910
You've certainly taken a shine
to that magazine.

02:42.980 --> 02:44.780
It's not just
one magazine,
Marge,

02:44.840 --> 02:47.940
They take hundreds of magazines,
filter out the crap

02:48.010 --> 02:50.040
and leave you with something

02:50.120 --> 02:52.690
that fits right
in your front pocket.

03:01.190 --> 03:02.820
Hey, what gives, man?

03:02.900 --> 03:04.500
We're all going
to sit down as a family

03:04.560 --> 03:08.090
and listen to an inspiring story
of wilderness survival.

03:08.170 --> 03:10.200
"..Then I heard the sound

of the sea lion."

03:15.570 --> 03:17.340
He'll be killed!

03:17.410 --> 03:21.180
Homer, he obviously got out
alive if he wrote the article.

03:21.250 --> 03:23.150
Don't be so...

03:23.220 --> 03:24.790
Oh, you're right.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.230

03:34.290 --> 03:37.060

something you'd like
to do too.

How's it going, honey?

Not very well.

When I got stuck like this,
I'd go for a bike ride.

on bike rides anymore?

maybe bikes

that word? "Cool?"

Patriotism Editor

10:08.870 --> 10:10.670
of <i>Reading Digest.</i>

10:10.740 --> 10:11.940
Ooh, I love your magazine.

10:12.010 --> 10:13.480
My favorite section

10:13.540 --> 10:15.980
is "how to increase
your word power."

10:16.040 --> 10:18.510
is really, really, really...
good.

10:18.580 --> 10:23.950
Well good.
Lisa, I'd like you to meet
some of the other finalists.

10:24.020 --> 10:26.360
This is Trong Van Dinh
and Maria Dominguez.

10:26.420 --> 10:27.560
Hello.
Hello.

10:27.620 --> 10:29.450
Maria is the National
Spelling Bee Champion.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.220
and Trong has won both

10:31.290 --> 10:32.920
the Westinghouse
Talent Search

10:32.990 --> 10:36.260
and the N.F.L. Punt,
Pass and Kick Competition.

10:36.330 --> 10:38.940
Have either of you ever run
into any problems

10:39.000 --> 10:40.810
because of
your superior ability?

10:40.870 --> 10:42.370
Sure, I guess.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.310
Oh, me too.

10:45.510 --> 10:47.480
These are special
V.I.P. badges.

10:47.540 --> 10:48.270
They'll get you
into places

10:48.340 --> 10:49.740
other tourists never see.

10:49.810 --> 10:51.450
Miss, what does the "I"
stand for?

10:51.510 --> 10:52.470
Important.

10:52.550 --> 10:54.750
Ooh...How about the "V"?

10:54.820 --> 10:56.220
Very.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.780
- Oh... and Miss?
Just one more question.
- Person.

10:58.850 --> 11:00.750
Ahh....

11:00.820 --> 11:01.380
What does the "I"

11:01.460 --> 11:02.190
stand for again?

11:02.260 --> 11:02.960
Oh!

11:07.000 --> 11:10.970
"On this spot, Richard Nixon
bowled back-to-back 300 games."

11:11.030 --> 11:12.130
Yeah, right.

11:12.200 --> 11:15.610
Wow, the President's bathroom.

11:19.210 --> 11:20.980
Do you mind?

11:21.040 --> 11:22.940
Barbara Bush!

11:23.010 --> 11:25.180
Oh, you have
those damn badges.

11:25.250 --> 11:26.850
Okay.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.890
This tub was installed
in 1894...

11:29.950 --> 11:33.960
Mmm-- money.

11:34.020 --> 11:36.560
Ahhh.

11:36.630 --> 11:38.700
Hey, watch it, Chief.

11:38.760 --> 11:42.400
Folks, we print more than
18,000,000 bills a day.

11:42.460 --> 11:45.730
Oh, and in case
you were wondering,

11:45.800 --> 11:48.970
no, we don't give out
free samples.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.740
Lousy, cheap country.

Oh, Marge, grow up!

12:11.830 --> 12:12.830
Man:
<i>Congressman,</i>

12:12.890 --> 12:14.660
this is
Springfield National Forest.

12:14.730 --> 12:18.070
Basically, what we want to do
is cut her down.

12:18.130 --> 12:19.490
As you can see
in our artist's
rendition

12:19.570 --> 12:23.040
it's full of old growth,
just aging and festering away.

12:23.100 --> 12:26.600
In comes our logging company
to thin out the clutter.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.410
It's all part
of nature's cycle.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.710
Jerry, you're a whale
of a lobbyist

12:30.780 --> 12:33.120
and I'd like to give you
a logging permit, I would..

12:33.180 --> 12:35.790
but this isn't
like burying toxic waste.

12:35.850 --> 12:38.760
People are gonna notice
those trees are gone.

12:38.820 --> 12:42.060
Congressman, this is where
it gets awkward.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.890
I never quite know
how to put this.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.630
I just want to...

12:47.700 --> 12:48.700
Offer me a bribe?

12:50.770 --> 12:51.700
( <i>laughing</i> )

( <i>intercom buzzing</i> )

12:53.000 --> 12:54.410
What is it?

12:54.470 --> 12:56.370
It's that little girl
from Springfield

12:56.440 --> 12:57.910
who wrote the essay.

12:57.970 --> 12:59.300
Could be a good photo-op.

12:59.370 --> 12:59.930
Sure, fine.

13:00.010 --> 13:01.580
So where do we..?

13:01.640 --> 13:05.910
Not here. I've got a
little place that I use
for these matters.

13:05.980 --> 13:07.350
Call me tonight.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.890
Well, hi there.
You must be
Lisa Simpson.

13:09.950 --> 13:11.560
Hello, sir.

13:11.620 --> 13:14.960
Lisa, you're a doer.
And who knows?
Maybe someday

13:15.020 --> 13:16.720
you'll be a congressman
or a senator.

13:16.790 --> 13:18.660
We have quite a few
women senators,
you know.

13:18.730 --> 13:20.430
Only two.
I checked.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.400

13:30.740 --> 13:32.410
Oh, isn't that nice?

13:32.470 --> 13:34.740
Now there is a politician
who cares.

13:34.810 --> 13:36.910
If I ever vote,
it will be for him.

13:36.980 --> 13:37.680
( <i>burping</i> )

13:42.750 --> 13:44.360
Mom?

13:44.420 --> 13:47.760
Lisa, the contest
isn't for three hours.

13:47.820 --> 13:49.420
I'm too excited
to sleep.

13:49.490 --> 13:51.800
Anyone up for the Winifred
Beecher Howe Memorial?

13:51.860 --> 13:52.930
Who's that?

13:52.990 --> 13:54.690
An early crusader
for women's rights.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.590
She led the Floor Mop
Rebellion of 1910.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.940
Later she appeared on the highly
unpopular 75-cent piece.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.160
( <i>groans</i> )

14:02.240 --> 14:05.310
Okay, but you don't know
what you're missing.

Amen, sister.

no one ever came here.

on Springfield Forest?

I need your advice.

What can I do to make this
a better country?

Is this a good time
to buy a house?

15:14.110 --> 15:15.550
I can't get my
boy to brush properly.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.050
Would I look good
with a moustache?

but that just made it worse.

No one ever comes to see me.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.540
I don't blame them.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.140
I never did anything important--

15:46.210 --> 15:48.010
just The Declaration
of Independence

15:48.080 --> 15:49.750
The Louisiana Purchase,
The Dumbwaiter...

all the votes you need

Mr. Speaker,
I'm all for the bill, but..

and had no money in our pockets.

or possibly Canada--

19:51.790 --> 19:54.220
could our family find
such opportunity?

That's why whenever I see
the stars and stripes

19:57.830 --> 20:01.800
I'll always be reminded
of that wonderful word, "flag."

20:20.820 --> 20:22.620
Give me one of those.

Marge:
"Imprisoned congressman becomes

20:25.020 --> 20:26.760
born-again Christian."

20:26.820 --> 20:28.060
I can't believe it.

20:28.120 --> 20:30.120
The system works.

He already sang this song.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.300
No, that was about
the budget gap.

20:39.370 --> 20:42.670
This is the trading gap.

20:42.740 --> 20:44.910
And now the moment of truth.

20:44.970 --> 20:46.670
Will the winning essay be

20:46.740 --> 20:49.550
"Bubble On, Oh, Melting Pot"

20:49.610 --> 20:52.650
"Lift High Your Lamp,
Green Lady"

20:52.710 --> 20:55.810
"U.S.A. A-Okay"

20:55.880 --> 20:58.310
or "Cesspool on the Potomac"?

20:58.390 --> 20:59.460
Cesspool! Cesspool!

20:59.520 --> 21:01.360
Cesspool! Cesspool! Cesspool!

21:01.420 --> 21:03.480

Miss Crowley, thank you

21:14.000 --> 21:15.840
for this oversized
novelty check.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.100
I would like
to share this honor

21:18.170 --> 21:20.070
with all
of my fellow essayists

21:20.140 --> 21:22.080
particularly
the courageous Lisa Simpson

21:22.140 --> 21:25.310
whose inflammatory
rhetoric reminded us

21:25.380 --> 21:27.950
that the price of freedom
is eternal vigilance.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.290
Give her the check!

21:29.350 --> 21:31.390

21:31.450 --> 21:33.550
