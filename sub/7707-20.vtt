WEBVTT

00:03.704 --> 00:07.506
How come so many of these
are lemon-scented?

00:07.508 --> 00:10.809
Because lemon
smells nice, I guess.

00:10.811 --> 00:12.611
Well, in that case,
why don't they make one

00:12.613 --> 00:15.014
that smells like old sneakers?

00:16.517 --> 00:18.684
Manly, yes

00:18.686 --> 00:20.719
but I like it too.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.257
Lynn, uh, you want me to dry?

00:25.259 --> 00:26.825
Thanks, dad.

00:26.827 --> 00:29.561
Hey, look, you could tell
fortunes with these.

00:29.563 --> 00:33.098
Behold, a Fantastik Future.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.100
Ha!

00:35.102 --> 00:38.804
Dare I ask what's behind
this fascination

00:38.806 --> 00:40.973
with cleaning products?

00:40.975 --> 00:42.241
Cleaning.

00:42.243 --> 00:45.310
I thought I'd help out
now that Kate's in detox.

00:45.312 --> 00:46.378
[chuckles]

00:46.380 --> 00:48.047
ALF, she's not in detox.

00:48.049 --> 00:51.383
She went
to a real estate seminar.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.619
That's your story.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.020
[doorbell rings]

00:55.022 --> 00:56.121
Oh, great.

00:56.123 --> 00:59.124
I was just gonna
wax and buff in there.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.995
ALF, I hate to stifle
your generosity

01:02.997 --> 01:06.331
but I don't think we can afford
any more of your help.

01:06.333 --> 01:09.034
Hey, if you're referring
to the striped shirt incident

01:09.036 --> 01:10.969
I got the stains
out of it, didn't I?

01:10.971 --> 01:13.005
You also got the stripes out.

01:14.075 --> 01:17.476
Willie, Willie.
You're so negative.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.511
Take my advice.

01:19.513 --> 01:22.114
Gain Joy.

01:24.351 --> 01:26.485
You take mine.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.753
Vanish.

01:34.061 --> 01:36.161
[theme music]

02:03.457 --> 02:06.291
[music continues]

02:35.489 --> 02:38.023
[instrumental music]

02:40.661 --> 02:42.461
- Danny, hi.
- Hi.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.666
Did you come by for
anything special or was that it?

02:47.668 --> 02:49.801
My dad just told me
that I have to go

02:49.803 --> 02:52.771
to our family reunion
in San Diego.

02:52.773 --> 02:56.408
Lucky you. Our family reunion
was in Oxnard.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.543
No, unlucky me.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.011
I'm not gonna make it
back in time

02:59.013 --> 03:00.846
to take you
to the spring dance tomorrow.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.748
- Oh, no.
- I know, I fe..

03:02.750 --> 03:05.184
I feel really terrible.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.451
Yeah!

03:06.453 --> 03:09.321
Well...you didn't
just go out and buy a dress

03:09.323 --> 03:10.756
that you're gonna have
to hide the bill

03:10.758 --> 03:13.692
from your father for...it.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.360
And you're the English tutor.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.428
[chuckles]

03:16.430 --> 03:18.497
I'm-I'm really sorry about this.

03:18.499 --> 03:22.167
Well, there'll be
other dances, I guess.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.202
Yeah.

03:24.238 --> 03:25.837
Do you want a soda
or something?

03:25.839 --> 03:29.708
I can't. I've gotta go help
my mom make coleslaw.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.211
I just wanted
to comfort you in person.

03:34.148 --> 03:36.882
There. Are you comforted now?

03:36.884 --> 03:39.618
Not quite.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.820
There. Better?

03:42.790 --> 03:45.057
It'll do for now.

03:45.059 --> 03:47.593
Uh, I-I'll call you
when I get back.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.027
Great!

03:49.029 --> 03:51.196
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:54.301 --> 03:56.535
[sighs]

03:56.537 --> 03:59.104
- Let's call Kate again.
- Why?

03:59.106 --> 04:00.939
I forgot to tell her something.

04:00.941 --> 04:04.309
- What?
- That I washed her new sweater.

04:05.980 --> 04:09.081
Uh, on second thought,
that could be a surprise.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.384
Who was that
at the door, sweetheart?

04:12.386 --> 04:16.188
- Danny.
- Uh-oh. Boy troubles?

04:16.190 --> 04:17.222
Dad, really.

04:17.224 --> 04:19.758
You make it sound
like I'm 12 years old.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.293
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.495
[clears throat]
What's the problem?

04:23.497 --> 04:25.063
Just a little..

04:25.065 --> 04:27.666
<i> ...difficulty</i> with..

04:27.668 --> 04:29.268
...a guy.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.970
And you say you understand
your daughter.

04:33.007 --> 04:35.073
Danny can't go
to the dance tomorrow night.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.975
Oh, what a shame.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.644
I was really
looking forward to it.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.979
Well, isn't there somebody else
you can go with?

04:40.981 --> 04:42.714
I think I might be free.

04:42.716 --> 04:45.317
I'll check my week at a glance.

04:45.319 --> 04:47.753
It wouldn't be right
to get another date.

04:47.755 --> 04:51.156
Danny and I
are going steady.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.724
Kind of.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.726
Well, did you exchange socks?

04:54.728 --> 04:57.896
- No.
- Trade bellybutton lint?

04:58.932 --> 05:01.933
What exactly
are you talking about?

05:01.935 --> 05:05.037
The three stages
of courtship on Melmac

05:05.039 --> 05:08.640
exchange left socks,
trade bellybutton lint

05:08.642 --> 05:10.842
and spit in each other's soup.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.081
Well, you got to admit
it's a bond.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.819
When did you and Danny decide
that you were going steady?

05:20.821 --> 05:23.355
There wasn't
one specific moment.

05:23.357 --> 05:26.291
But he's not seeing
any other girls?

05:26.293 --> 05:29.227
He didn't say that exactly.

05:29.229 --> 05:31.897
But he doesn't want you
to date other guys?

05:31.899 --> 05:35.133
I don't know.
He probably doesn't.

05:35.135 --> 05:38.804
So you have no promises,
no lint, no spit.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.706
What do you have?

05:40.708 --> 05:42.874
If you need me,
I'll be in my room.

05:44.311 --> 05:48.480
This problem would be solved
if she would just hocktooey

05:48.482 --> 05:50.782
into Danny's chowder.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.551
That's disgusting.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.486
Know what's wrong
with you, Willie?

05:54.488 --> 05:56.455
No sense of romance.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.660
[instrumental music]

06:04.865 --> 06:06.832
Expansive.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.334
[whispering]
Expansive. Expansive.

06:09.336 --> 06:12.537
Widely extended
or comprehensive?

06:12.539 --> 06:13.972
Right.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.941
Expedient.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.844
[whispering]
Expedient. Expedient. Expedient.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.946
Suitable for a purpose?

06:22.516 --> 06:24.750
Uh, was that right?

06:24.752 --> 06:26.318
Oh, I'm sorry. It-it was.

06:26.320 --> 06:29.588
I guess my mind
was just someplace else.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.324
[sighs]
Exasperate.

06:32.326 --> 06:34.626
[whispering]
Exasperate. Exasperate.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.962
To frustrate or annoy?

06:36.964 --> 06:38.930
Tell me about it.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.234
To annoy or frustrate?

06:43.437 --> 06:45.537
[chuckles]
I'm sorry, Randy.

06:45.539 --> 06:48.840
You were right the first time.
I was just thinking out loud.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.109
I wish I could do that.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.511
What do you mean?

06:52.513 --> 06:55.881
Thinking and stuff
because I'm stupid.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.315
No, you're not.

06:57.317 --> 06:59.684
Sure I am. Everybody says so.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.754
Well, everybody is wrong.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.589
You're not stupid, you're..

07:06.593 --> 07:08.560
...quiet.

07:08.562 --> 07:11.997
It's hard to think of stuff
to say when you're stupid.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.665
You are not stupid.

07:13.667 --> 07:17.269
You're learning these
vocabulary words in no time.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.604
Well, that's because of you.

07:19.606 --> 07:23.208
You're...you know, brilliant.

07:24.278 --> 07:27.045
Randy, I'm hardly brilliant.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.814
Sure you are.

07:28.816 --> 07:32.184
And earnest and empathetic..

07:32.186 --> 07:35.554
...and...exorbitant.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.990
Exorbitant?

07:38.992 --> 07:40.992
I wasn't sure about that one.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.329
You're very sweet.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.999
Hey, Randy. How's it going?

07:49.336 --> 07:51.536
- Okay.
- Well, good.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.572
How are things
with the track team?

07:55.375 --> 07:57.409
Okay.

07:57.411 --> 07:59.611
Still putting the old shot?

08:01.081 --> 08:02.581
Yeah.

08:04.451 --> 08:06.651
How's the vocabulary going?

08:08.689 --> 08:10.088
Okay.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.191
Keep up the good work.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.127
Okay.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.463
Oh, uh, Julie called
a little earlier.

08:18.465 --> 08:20.198
It was something
about the dance.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.534
Oh, did you tell her
I'm not going?

08:22.536 --> 08:25.070
Yeah, but she-she wants you
to call her anyway.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.072
Okay. Thanks.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.174
Nice talking to you, Randy.

08:35.516 --> 08:37.549
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

08:37.551 --> 08:40.685
- I'll see you next Saturday.
- Okay.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.021
So I guess I won't see
you tonight at the dance, huh?

08:43.023 --> 08:45.657
- Oh. Are you going?
- No.

08:45.659 --> 08:48.159
Oh, me neither.
But you knew that.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.461
- Yeah.
- Did you wanna take those--

08:49.463 --> 08:52.264
So I guess we're
not going together.

08:52.266 --> 08:54.466
I mean, like, you know

08:54.468 --> 08:57.068
we're not<i> going</i> together.

08:57.070 --> 09:00.539
I mean, we're not going
not together.

09:02.309 --> 09:05.710
Yes. We<i> aren't.</i>

09:05.712 --> 09:09.481
Unless...you wanted
to go together.

09:09.483 --> 09:12.817
Just since we're not going
not together.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.254
Oh.

09:16.256 --> 09:19.457
Oh, you mean,
us with each other?

09:19.459 --> 09:21.459
- Yeah, exactly.
- Oh, I don't know if--

09:21.461 --> 09:23.662
- Oh, that's okay.
- Oh.

09:23.664 --> 09:27.232
No, it's not that. It's just
that, see, Danny and I were..

09:27.234 --> 09:29.801
See, we have
this understanding, which we..

09:32.172 --> 09:34.005
Sure. Why not?

09:34.007 --> 09:35.807
It might be fun.

09:35.809 --> 09:36.875
Okay.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.614
7 o'clock?

09:42.616 --> 09:43.648
Okay.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.424
- Thank you.
- Oh, they're not from me.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.768
Lynn, look at this.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.270
Mom's silver stuff. So?

10:05.272 --> 10:07.105
It's miraculous.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.406
Look.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.877
ALF, it's silver polish.

10:12.879 --> 10:15.180
But it zips through
your cleaning chores

10:15.182 --> 10:17.182
quicker than you ever
dreamed possible.

10:18.518 --> 10:21.820
You need a life.
I'm going to wash my hair.

10:21.822 --> 10:24.022
Randy's taking me to the dance.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.124
Better be a slow dance.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.026
Ha!

10:28.028 --> 10:29.194
Oh, and if mom calls

10:29.196 --> 10:31.596
double-check
her flight time tonight.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.398
Righty-o!

10:34.267 --> 10:36.101
Makes cleaning your silver

10:36.103 --> 10:39.904
almost as much fun
as tarnishing it.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.473
[phone rings]

10:44.144 --> 10:46.411
Hello?

10:46.413 --> 10:49.881
Uh, uh, no, she can't come
to the phone right now.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.485
Oh, hi, Danny. Uh, me?

10:53.487 --> 10:55.987
Oh, I'm Lynn's cousin
Alf...fred.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.123
Alfred. Yeah.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.859
Uh, how's San Diego?

11:00.861 --> 11:02.594
Oh, really?

11:02.596 --> 11:04.629
No, no, don't bother
rushing back.

11:04.631 --> 11:07.799
Lynn's got another date
for the dance.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.602
Hello? Hello?

11:12.305 --> 11:15.306
[instrumental music]

11:18.011 --> 11:19.744
[video game beeps]

11:19.746 --> 11:22.280
Has anybody seen
my black velvet purse?

11:22.282 --> 11:25.784
Laundry room.
I washed it for you.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.552
How bad is it?

11:27.554 --> 11:30.722
Looks like a drowned beaver.
I think you might like it.

11:30.724 --> 11:33.058
Check it out.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.026
That's okay.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.828
Can we order the pizza now?

11:36.830 --> 11:39.130
Ixnay on the izza-pay

11:39.132 --> 11:42.467
in front of your ister-say.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.869
No pizza, ALF. You just ate.

11:44.871 --> 11:48.139
But we wanted to give Kate
a homecoming gift.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.008
And what could be
more appropriate

11:50.010 --> 11:53.812
than a greasy cardboard box?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.380
ALF, you'd better
get in the kitchen.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.415
Randy will be here any minute.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.017
I just hope Danny
doesn't misunderstand

11:59.019 --> 12:01.419
my going to the dance
with someone else.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.788
He didn't sound
too mad on the phone.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.558
What?

12:06.560 --> 12:09.594
Of course, he did hang up on me.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.262
What?

12:11.264 --> 12:13.465
Did I neglect to mention
that Danny called

12:13.467 --> 12:15.633
while you were in the shower?

12:15.635 --> 12:17.268
Yes!

12:17.270 --> 12:18.670
Sorry.

12:18.672 --> 12:20.905
He called while
you were in the shower.

12:22.275 --> 12:25.009
So, Bri, what say
we make some popcorn?

12:25.011 --> 12:27.145
Yeah.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.114
ALF..

12:29.116 --> 12:31.316
...what have you done?

12:31.318 --> 12:33.585
Nothing. It's Danny.

12:33.587 --> 12:37.021
You shouldn't date
somebody so unreliable.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.558
What did he say?

12:40.560 --> 12:42.260
Just that he could
make it back in time

12:42.262 --> 12:43.628
for the dance after all.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.730
- ALF!
- Don't worry.

12:45.732 --> 12:48.600
I told him not to bother
'cause you had another date.

12:49.736 --> 12:50.935
You're welcome.

12:52.038 --> 12:54.839
It's not a real date,
it's just Randy.

12:54.841 --> 12:56.508
Because we're friends
and we were not

12:56.510 --> 12:58.576
going not together.

12:58.578 --> 13:02.313
Don't panic.
I not know what not to do.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.450
What?

13:05.452 --> 13:08.486
Call Randy, you tell him
you have amnesia.

13:08.488 --> 13:11.356
Better yet,
tell him<i> he</i> has amnesia.

13:11.358 --> 13:12.824
He'll buy that.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.995
Alright, you tell him the truth.

13:16.997 --> 13:20.098
Your boyfriend's back
and he's gonna be in trouble.

13:20.100 --> 13:23.735
Hey now, hey now,
your boyfriend's back.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.438
I can't believe this.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.940
I know what you mean.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.810
I can't believe
Bruce Willis is a star

13:31.812 --> 13:33.344
but there it is!

13:34.981 --> 13:36.815
I was going
to explain to Danny

13:36.817 --> 13:38.783
that I'm just going
with Randy as a friend.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.552
Now, thanks to you
he's gonna think

13:40.554 --> 13:42.420
that I'm seeing somebody else.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.922
[doorbell rings]

13:43.924 --> 13:45.557
There's Randy.

13:45.559 --> 13:48.226
But don't think this means
you're off the hook.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.994
Well, this is the last time

13:49.996 --> 13:53.031
I play Kelly Girl for you.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.399
Good.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.339
Danny.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.508
You, uh, you mind if I come in?

14:10.417 --> 14:11.916
[instrumental music]

14:13.253 --> 14:16.721
So...who is he?

14:16.723 --> 14:17.956
Danny, I can explain.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.058
No, I'm not even gone
one day and

14:20.060 --> 14:23.027
and you're already bringing
in somebody from the bench.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.796
It wasn't like that.

14:24.798 --> 14:26.197
You said you couldn't be here

14:26.199 --> 14:27.632
I didn't wanna miss the dance

14:27.634 --> 14:31.035
somebody else asked me,
and I said yes.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.037
Who? Who asked you?

14:33.039 --> 14:35.006
Randy Boylan.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.876
No, really, Lynn,
you can tell me. Who is he?

14:37.878 --> 14:42.113
Randy.
He happens to be very sweet.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.215
Besides, you said
you couldn't go to the dance.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.550
What did you expect me to do

14:45.552 --> 14:47.518
just sit home and stare
at your picture?

14:47.520 --> 14:49.520
I spent the whole day
talking my dad

14:49.522 --> 14:50.922
into letting me come back.

14:50.924 --> 14:53.558
I call to tell you, and your
cousin Alfred informs me

14:53.560 --> 14:55.026
that you're going
with somebody else.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.861
Unfortunately,
Alfred isn't the most

14:56.863 --> 15:00.798
reliable source
of information around here.

15:00.800 --> 15:04.469
I am going with someone else,
but he's just a friend.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.640
Alright. Alright.

15:08.642 --> 15:10.875
It's no big deal.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.911
Randy will show up,
you'll give him

15:12.913 --> 15:14.412
the brush
and then we're out of here.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.480
Danny, just because you..

15:15.482 --> 15:16.714
[doorbell rings]

15:17.450 --> 15:18.816
[sighs]

15:22.222 --> 15:24.122
- Hi.
- Hi, Randy.

15:24.124 --> 15:27.191
Hey, I didn't know
if you liked candy or what.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.194
Very smooth, man.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.230
- Danny, please.
- Hey, Danny.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.866
I would like to explain this.

15:34.868 --> 15:37.368
What's to explain?
Just tell him.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.970
Tell him what?

15:41.074 --> 15:43.074
How about some soda first?

15:43.076 --> 15:45.243
What kind you got?

15:45.245 --> 15:46.978
Oh, yeah.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.681
Will you stop playing hostess?
We're gonna be late.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.015
Late for what?

15:51.017 --> 15:53.384
The dance.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.186
I'm confused.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.588
Now there's a newsflash.

15:57.590 --> 16:00.224
How can you tell
when the popcorn's done?

16:00.226 --> 16:01.592
When it stops popping

16:01.594 --> 16:03.728
or when the fire department
gets here

16:03.730 --> 16:05.697
whichever comes first.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.967
What's going on out there?

16:08.969 --> 16:12.870
Danny just broke
Lynn's date with Randy.

16:12.872 --> 16:15.039
Is Randy mad?

16:15.041 --> 16:16.341
He doesn't know yet.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.209
The information
has entered his head

16:18.211 --> 16:21.679
and is now searching
desperately for his brain.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.983
Wait a minute.

16:24.985 --> 16:27.819
- I think he's getting it.
- Danny.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.623
Danny and I had a date
for the dance tonight..

16:32.625 --> 16:34.158
...which he broke.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.627
Well, if he broke your date,
then you can go with me.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.363
W-well,
I-I'm un-breaking the date.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.597
I'm takin' her.

16:39.599 --> 16:40.965
I'm takin' her.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.867
In that jacket?

16:42.869 --> 16:44.769
What's wrong with this jacket?

16:44.771 --> 16:47.939
Oh, nothing, if you happen
to sell Buicks.

16:47.941 --> 16:50.408
Yeah. What about your jacket?

16:50.410 --> 16:51.943
What about it?

16:53.079 --> 16:54.112
It's okay.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.183
Are they fighting yet?

16:59.185 --> 17:02.787
No. They're discussing
fashion trends.

17:03.656 --> 17:06.057
You want salt on your yours?

17:06.059 --> 17:07.959
Curry powder.

17:07.961 --> 17:09.327
Yuck.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.661
It's good for you.

17:10.663 --> 17:13.765
Grows hair in your ears.

17:13.767 --> 17:16.701
Why are those guys
fighting over Lynn, anyway?

17:16.703 --> 17:18.669
It's a little hard to explain.

17:18.671 --> 17:21.939
I mean, it's not like
she's Heather Locklear.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.143
Maybe I don't have to explain.

17:28.081 --> 17:30.114
Really, guys,
I don't think I'm worth--

17:30.116 --> 17:33.618
Lynn, please.
This is between Randy and me.

17:33.620 --> 17:37.055
Now, look, I don't wanna
fight about this.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.824
Why not?
Afraid I'll mess up your jacket?

17:39.826 --> 17:42.260
Hey, this jacket comes off.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.996
Yeah? Well, see
if you head does too.

17:46.366 --> 17:49.767
Ten bucks says Randy mops up
the floor with Danny.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.203
I don't take sucker bets.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.105
Uh-oh. Incoming sister.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.644
[sighs]
What am I going to do?

17:59.646 --> 18:01.979
They're hanging up
their jackets.

18:01.981 --> 18:03.181
Oh, no.

18:03.183 --> 18:06.717
Stop them before they
iron Willie's shirts.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.820
ALF, help me.
They're gonna fight.

18:08.822 --> 18:11.456
- I've got to stop them.
- Oh, sure, Lynn.

18:11.458 --> 18:14.926
I'll just zap them
with my time-freezing phaser.

18:14.928 --> 18:17.628
We saw that on "Star Trek."

18:17.630 --> 18:19.764
I wish mom and dad were here.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.632
Well, you know what
Willie would say.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.067
What?

18:23.069 --> 18:25.870
You got yourself into this,
get yourself out.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.806
ALF, he'd say that to you.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.509
This isn't my fault.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.377
Wait a minute.

18:33.379 --> 18:35.446
Maybe it is.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.281
That's it.
Thanks, ALF.

18:37.283 --> 18:40.751
No problem.
Diplomacy is my middle name.

18:43.022 --> 18:45.223
Okay, if you insist
on playing this game

18:45.225 --> 18:46.824
you're gonna
play by my rules.

18:46.826 --> 18:49.093
- What rules?
- You each only get one punch.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.963
- One's all I need.
- Okay, Randy, you go first.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.464
Hit me.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.765
Hit you?

18:54.767 --> 18:57.068
- You're a girl.
- Right.

18:57.070 --> 18:59.270
I'm the girl
that caused this mess.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.806
So, why aren't
either of you mad at me?

19:03.042 --> 19:05.877
- I'll tell you why.
- Oh, good.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.946
Because this isn't about me.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.848
It's about
some kind of macho thing.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.918
This guy is moving in
on my territory.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.920
Your territory?

19:15.922 --> 19:18.256
What do I look like,
the Louisiana Purchase?

19:18.258 --> 19:19.390
Yeah. Beat it.

19:19.392 --> 19:22.160
And who asked you
to play Rambo for me?

19:22.162 --> 19:24.162
I'm sorry.

19:24.164 --> 19:27.465
Randy, I said I'd go
to the dance with you

19:27.467 --> 19:29.200
because I think you're sweet

19:29.202 --> 19:31.869
not because you can
beat people up.

19:31.871 --> 19:35.072
You mean, you still
wanna go with me?

19:35.074 --> 19:36.741
Yes. I do.

19:38.211 --> 19:39.610
Okay.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.379
Oh, hey, hold on a minute--

19:41.381 --> 19:43.214
Danny, may I please see you
on the porch?

19:43.216 --> 19:44.649
No. A-anything
you have to say--

19:44.651 --> 19:45.983
Porch.

19:53.293 --> 19:56.060
Look, none of this
was Randy's fault.

19:56.062 --> 19:57.595
Oh, I suppose it was my fault.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.964
Danny, you raced back here

19:59.966 --> 20:02.033
assuming I'd be sitting
around waiting for you.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.335
- Well, I wasn't.
- We have been dating.

20:04.337 --> 20:07.205
Exactly. We've been dating.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.307
No more, no less.

20:09.309 --> 20:12.143
Wh.. You're not saying
that you wanna stop seeing me?

20:12.145 --> 20:14.111
Not at all.

20:14.113 --> 20:16.047
Are you saying
you wanna stop seeing me?

20:16.049 --> 20:18.182
No!

20:18.184 --> 20:21.485
Well...then..

20:21.487 --> 20:24.755
If you wanna get more serious

20:24.757 --> 20:28.426
I...I think
we should talk about it.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.861
Okay. Let's talk about it.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.265
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.837
Lynn..

20:39.839 --> 20:41.839
...how do you feel about..

20:41.841 --> 20:44.742
...being serious?

20:44.744 --> 20:46.510
I feel okay.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.479
Okay.

20:49.415 --> 20:50.448
Okay.

20:51.985 --> 20:54.685
So does this mean that you won't
go to the dance with Randy?

20:54.687 --> 21:00.258
No. He's my friend,
he asked me and I accepted.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.359
Yeah.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.128
Well, I-I guess, that's okay.

21:04.130 --> 21:07.865
- Thank you for your permission.
- No. Wait. I didn't mean..

21:07.867 --> 21:10.268
I'm sorry.
Let me start again.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.772
How would you feel if we..

21:14.774 --> 21:16.674
...be serious

21:16.676 --> 21:19.243
starting tomorrow?

21:19.245 --> 21:20.311
Okay.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.614
Okay.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.950
Well, have a good time tonight.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.551
- I will.
- But not too good.

21:27.553 --> 21:30.421
- And-and be home by 11.
- 11?

21:30.423 --> 21:32.290
Alright. 11:30.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.928
There. Are you comforted now?

21:37.930 --> 21:39.864
Not quite.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.669
- Better?
- No.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.304
- Goodnight.
- Night.

21:46.306 --> 21:49.774
Oh, and-and tell Randy
I'm sorry I insulted his jacket.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.876
And his mother.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.210
Will do.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.916
Shall we go?

21:58.918 --> 22:01.085
Okay.

22:01.087 --> 22:03.654
Night, Bri. Night...dad.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.122
Thanks for your help.

22:05.124 --> 22:08.125
(ALF)
'Night, daughter.
Be home by 11.'

22:14.033 --> 22:17.768
They didn't even hit
each other once. What a gyp.

22:17.770 --> 22:20.871
You shouldn't look
at violence as entertainment.

22:20.873 --> 22:23.574
It's not good
for your development.

22:23.576 --> 22:27.611
Come on, Geraldo's
on Morton Downey. Grab a chair.

22:27.613 --> 22:29.914
[instrumental music]

22:31.818 --> 22:33.651
[instrumental music]

22:37.924 --> 22:39.090
(Kate)
'Thanks, honey.'

22:39.092 --> 22:41.292
Careful, Kate,
the floor is still wet.

22:41.294 --> 22:43.527
No, it's not.
It's just that I've cleaned it

22:43.529 --> 22:45.329
right down to the shine.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.733
I have never seen this kitchen

22:48.735 --> 22:51.235
look so spotless.

22:51.237 --> 22:53.904
Even the light fixtures
look cleaner.

22:53.906 --> 22:56.107
And they are.

22:56.109 --> 22:57.942
And it smells like..

22:57.944 --> 23:01.245
Like a pine forest
just after a rain.

23:01.247 --> 23:04.281
- Exactly.
- Check out the dishes.
