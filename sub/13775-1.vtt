WEBVTT

00:01.904 --> 00:03.847
Welcome back to the 2012
draft.

00:03.961 --> 00:06.725
We've been talking about it for
months, so the next pick will

00:06.845 --> 00:08.510
not come as a surprise.

00:08.630 --> 00:12.180
It's going to be Robert Griffin
III, quarterback out of Baylor.

00:12.184 --> 00:14.815
See you soon.

00:14.818 --> 00:16.717
Did it. Love you, Mom.

00:16.721 --> 00:19.620
Love you. Whew.

00:19.624 --> 00:21.656
Good job, man. Thanks, man.

00:21.660 --> 00:24.892
Congratulations. How you doing, my man?

00:24.896 --> 00:27.462
Have a good one. I'm gonna do that.

00:27.466 --> 00:30.131
Rg3, rg3...

00:30.135 --> 00:32.564
- Hey.
- Welcome to the league.

00:32.685 --> 00:34.824
Thanks, Commissioner. Yeah, here we go.

00:35.044 --> 00:36.300
Uh-oh, what's this? There it is.

00:36.420 --> 00:38.187
Here we go, Rob.

00:38.307 --> 00:40.729
Here it is. It's official.

00:40.770 --> 00:42.681
Bam. All right.

00:42.683 --> 00:44.515
All right. Congratulations, Robert.

00:44.518 --> 00:46.131
Thank you.
All your hopes and dreams

00:46.251 --> 00:49.481
have finally culminated in you
being a member of Pete top/Kevin

00:49.601 --> 00:51.889
bottom.
I mean, all the hard work's

00:51.892 --> 00:53.734
definitely paid off.
Those days of protein shakes and

00:53.854 --> 00:56.340
bad gas landed me on team Ruxin.
We're the best.

00:56.460 --> 00:58.645
Just how good do you think it can be?

00:58.765 --> 01:02.530
I think, uh, Pete top/Kevin bottom can
definitely win the Shiva bowl. Whoa-ho.

01:02.650 --> 01:06.264
Shiva komedi somakanakram, bitches!

01:06.384 --> 01:08.609
And you don't find him
even remotely annoying?

01:08.833 --> 01:10.665
Actually I do not. I respect him.

01:10.785 --> 01:12.712
That's right, Andre's on the clock.

01:12.832 --> 01:15.763
Suck it! Wait up, Rodney.

01:15.883 --> 01:17.525
Man, why you telling people we're family?

01:17.645 --> 01:21.219
Next up in the 2012 draft,
it's the pick from the poorly

01:21.339 --> 01:25.342
named double entendres.

01:25.640 --> 01:28.311
You suck.

01:28.546 --> 01:31.930
Sorry. The double entendres select

01:32.050 --> 01:34.747
Trent Richardson, running back, Alabama.

01:34.867 --> 01:40.208
Let's do this. Dodged a bullet on that one, huh?
Yeah, all right, I like that.

01:40.328 --> 01:42.045
There it is, yeah, put it on, right?

01:42.343 --> 01:45.644
Boom, double entendres.
Trent, I got to ask you, how

01:45.646 --> 01:47.578
does it feel to be the newest
team member of a uninspired

01:47.583 --> 01:50.995
squad?
Worst feeling ever.

01:51.115 --> 01:52.814
I demand a trade.
Please, can you reconsider?

01:52.819 --> 01:54.683
Never. You won't regret this.

01:54.685 --> 01:56.451
Yes, you will. Back it up, back it up.

01:56.456 --> 01:57.883
Okay, first of all, who are you?

01:58.003 --> 01:59.570
His Mother. Okay, I am sorry.

01:59.690 --> 02:01.544
Um, look, I'll draft the whole family.

02:01.664 --> 02:03.226
I got a lot of positions.
No, no, not interested.

02:03.346 --> 02:05.063
You'd be a great kicker.
What did you call me?

02:05.183 --> 02:06.390
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
What?

02:06.510 --> 02:08.066
Is that a bad thing?
You little skinny MC Hammer.

02:08.186 --> 02:09.406
Whoa! Well, this appears to be

02:09.526 --> 02:12.546
another draft day first.
Wonder what the Commissioner has

02:12.666 --> 02:14.098
to say about that. Rodney?

02:14.569 --> 02:17.336
Rodney, Rodney. Hmm.

02:17.758 --> 02:22.171
Rodney. Oh, call me Roger,
call me Roger. Roger?

02:22.291 --> 02:25.742
What happened?

02:26.487 --> 02:32.955
I drafted too early. Think I got
a second round pick coming.

02:33.075 --> 02:37.558
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:37.678 --> 02:41.114
All right, this round is
brought to you by your Shiva

02:41.234 --> 02:43.063
- bowl champion.
- All right, take it

02:43.183 --> 02:44.883
easy, Rudy. Last season is definitely going

02:45.003 --> 02:47.241
to have an asterisk by it.
No, no asterisks.

02:47.361 --> 02:50.006
I earned it.
Ooh, Kevin McAsterisk.

02:50.126 --> 02:51.707
That has a nice ring to it.
Yes.

02:51.827 --> 02:54.529
They call Mr. McAsterisk.
No, they don't.

02:54.649 --> 02:55.845
Can I be Taco McAsterisk?

02:55.965 --> 02:57.433
You guys can be the McAsterisk brothers.

02:57.553 --> 03:00.517
Whoa, bam! Boo.

03:01.051 --> 03:03.508
What, come on, it's cool.
What, are we gonna do "talk"

03:03.628 --> 03:05.339
"to the hand" next?
Ooh, is that back in?

03:05.474 --> 03:08.458
Talk to the hand because
the face don't understand.

03:08.578 --> 03:10.175
I'm sorry that you have
to pleasure that monster.

03:10.179 --> 03:12.310
It must be unbearable for you.

03:12.312 --> 03:14.211
All right, I have a grievance here.

03:14.216 --> 03:17.315
You are the Sacko.
I would like to dole out Sacko

03:17.317 --> 03:19.450
punishments, but I'm not
allowed to all of a sudden?

03:19.455 --> 03:22.621
I think my punishment was
enough when I got a full-on

03:22.625 --> 03:28.360
stroke. Hey, which one of y'all is Kevin?
The one with the freakishly

03:28.364 --> 03:30.462
large head.
Uh, what the hell is this?

03:30.466 --> 03:32.965
This is my new online cowboy business.

03:32.969 --> 03:36.423
A division of Taco Corp.
Do you have some bad news for

03:36.543 --> 03:39.705
someone? Hire a cowboy to deliver the message.
Everything sounds better coming

03:39.709 --> 03:43.375
from a cowboy. This one's for you, Kevin.

03:43.379 --> 03:51.483
♪ Kevin, the money you loaned Taco he
ain't payin' it back. ♪

03:51.487 --> 03:53.552
I like it.
I need Howdy Doody to tell me that.

03:53.556 --> 03:55.520
Y'all have a good one. Bye.

03:55.522 --> 03:57.822
I am going to make a fortune.
No, you're not going to make

03:57.825 --> 03:59.757
a fortune. It's time to talk football.

03:59.762 --> 04:02.394
Commissioner, please, what is
our draft order this year?

04:02.398 --> 04:07.066
Um, I am no longer the
Commissioner of this league.

04:07.070 --> 04:10.368
Wait a second, if you're not
the Commissioner, who is?

04:10.372 --> 04:13.706
Howdy, partners. Oh.

04:13.710 --> 04:16.007
Oh, no, no. No, I told you, no cards.

04:16.012 --> 04:19.411
You son of a bitch.
So this is how you were able to

04:19.415 --> 04:22.214
hold onto your championship.
By the way, I don't like the "C"

04:22.218 --> 04:24.750
word, but this is collusion.
It is not collusion because

04:24.754 --> 04:27.251
I'm Commissioner and I'm
saying it's not collusion.

04:27.254 --> 04:29.087
Kevin... you see what you've done here?

04:29.092 --> 04:33.726
The concept of total
control is erotic to me.

04:33.730 --> 04:38.296
I am at full chub right now.

04:41.333 --> 04:43.430
So, how'd they take it?

04:43.550 --> 04:45.381
Not well.
Yeah?

04:45.385 --> 04:46.684
Draft gonna be next weekend still?

04:46.804 --> 04:51.314
Indeed. Shit, draft me a beautiful team next weekend.
Week after that, have a

04:51.434 --> 04:53.705
beautiful baby boy.
And I get to name him?

04:53.825 --> 04:55.889
That was the deal.
My beautiful boy.

04:56.009 --> 04:57.890
Mmm... mmm.

04:58.374 --> 05:01.181
I love you. I love you.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.734
Uh-uh, uh-uh, no, no, no. Doo-doo-doo.

05:03.738 --> 05:04.905
What? Easy.

05:05.017 --> 05:07.048
Come on, Kevin, I'm not gonna explode.

05:07.052 --> 05:10.218
I just don't want my son that
close to my dick, I just don't.

05:10.222 --> 05:12.603
How big do you think you are, Kevin?

05:14.824 --> 05:19.329
I just feel like right now that tunnel
is outbound traffic only. Really?

05:19.449 --> 05:22.496
Yeah. Because my other outbound tunnel

05:22.500 --> 05:25.066
you have tried to go inbound on many times.

05:25.068 --> 05:27.234
Well, you're not in the car
during rush hour, and the

05:27.239 --> 05:29.070
traffic signs are very confusing.

05:29.074 --> 05:31.605
Oh, come on, I miss it.
I know, I miss it, too, I

05:31.609 --> 05:33.942
really do.
You want me just a little?

05:33.944 --> 05:36.410
Look, look, look, look, look,
look at the proximity here.

05:36.413 --> 05:38.378
It's like they're whispering to each other.

05:38.383 --> 05:40.048
Don't you miss it?
I do.

05:40.052 --> 05:41.715
Well, then, do something about it.

05:41.719 --> 05:46.456
I tried watching pregnancy porn, but it
just grossed me out more. Okay, okay.

05:46.576 --> 05:48.957
Come on, just get comfortable.

05:48.961 --> 05:51.759
You should be on bed rest.

05:51.763 --> 05:53.894
Good night, my sweet love. Good night.

05:53.898 --> 05:55.830
Did you say something?

05:57.000 --> 06:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:04.788 --> 06:05.896
Guess what.
What?

06:06.136 --> 06:08.734
I got a new job.
Oh, look at that.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.669
Congratulations, Pete.
Got rid of that dead-end

06:10.672 --> 06:12.570
pencil-pushing job.
No, no, not in life... in the

06:12.575 --> 06:14.841
league. Look, I figured, since the Sacko

06:14.843 --> 06:17.464
Commissioner was going dormant
this year, I got myself a new

06:17.584 --> 06:21.247
title. I am the custodian of the hall of records.
Custodian's fitting.

06:21.249 --> 06:23.048
Look, the league web site has
this thing called the "league"

06:23.053 --> 06:25.861
"history" and it's been criminally ignored.

06:25.981 --> 06:27.052
Think that's where I send my lineup.

06:27.057 --> 06:29.422
Well, that's why you don't
have an actual lineup.

06:29.424 --> 06:31.723
Anyhow, I filled our league
history page with factoids and

06:31.726 --> 06:33.692
little fun tidbits from our time together.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.661
That's a pretty solid idea, Pete.

06:35.665 --> 06:39.168
That's ni... oh, what the shit, man?

06:39.288 --> 06:42.368
It's a factoid. He posted naked
pictures of me.

06:42.370 --> 06:46.118
Well, yeah, it's really just a
nice remembrance of the time

06:46.238 --> 06:48.204
when you used to get drunk in
college and run errands naked.

06:48.207 --> 06:51.478
Whoa, w-wait, what is this?
"Women that Andre has slept"

06:51.491 --> 06:52.588
with"? Oh, let me see that.

06:52.708 --> 06:54.164
No, no, no, this is not a complete list.

06:54.284 --> 06:55.430
There's, like, only four people on here.

06:55.550 --> 06:57.118
I-I have slept with plenty of women.

06:57.238 --> 06:58.450
Taco, you want to back me up here?

06:58.570 --> 06:59.815
Yep, all four are there. Come on.

06:59.935 --> 07:01.354
You guys see what Pete's doing?

07:01.494 --> 07:04.892
He can't torture one of us as
the Sacko Commissioner, so he's

07:04.896 --> 07:09.664
going to torture all of us by being the
custodian of the hall of records. Yes.

07:09.668 --> 07:11.500
Cards, ladies and gentlemen. Nice.

07:11.504 --> 07:15.202
Custodian. Okay, you can't just make up
jobs like this. Right, Commissioner?

07:15.207 --> 07:18.006
I am not your Commissioner.
If you want to talk to me, you

07:18.010 --> 07:20.542
can refer to me as your league
champion, and I have also made

07:20.546 --> 07:22.544
up some cards. Woo.

07:22.546 --> 07:24.105
What, did you guys all
get cards without me?

07:24.225 --> 07:27.849
Yep. Oh, Taco, who is "the Taco of"

07:27.853 --> 07:31.719
"the league."

07:31.723 --> 07:35.990
Hello? This is Jerry Jones with the Cowboys.
Yeah, uh, o-okay, Jerry

07:35.994 --> 07:37.991
Jones. Yeah, and this is Dan Snyder.

07:37.994 --> 07:40.394
This is Jerry Jones, owner of the
Cowboys, and I need to speak

07:40.399 --> 07:42.997
to Taco. He owns something I want.

07:43.001 --> 07:46.901
Um... it's Jerry Jones for Taco.

07:46.905 --> 07:49.904
Jerry Jones of, like, the
Dallas Cowboys Jerry Jones?

07:49.906 --> 07:52.239
Yeah, I highly doubt it.
Maybe it's Jenny Jones asking

07:52.244 --> 07:56.110
if he'll be on the show.
Dallas Cowboys. Oh.

07:56.114 --> 07:58.746
See, I figured the best place to
start my online Cowboys business

07:58.750 --> 08:02.384
was Dallas, and I was looking for
a web site to start it and I

08:02.388 --> 08:05.453
squatted on dallascowboys.com,
and I guess they let it lapse.

08:05.457 --> 08:07.722
Wait, you own dallascowboys.com?

08:07.726 --> 08:09.757
Darn tootin'.
What?!

08:09.759 --> 08:13.562
Hello? Hello? Hey! Hey! Put it on
speaker, speaker, speaker. Hello? Hello?

08:13.566 --> 08:17.031
This is Taco, the person.
I want that dallascowboys.com

08:17.035 --> 08:19.184
back, and I'm prepared to pay for it.

08:19.304 --> 08:21.211
I don't do deals over the phone, Jerry.

08:21.331 --> 08:24.406
Why don't I fly you and your
friends to Cowboys training

08:24.410 --> 08:27.075
camp, watch a little practice,
meet some players, we'll talk a

08:27.077 --> 08:30.978
little business. I can't imagine that
my friends would want to... what?!

08:30.982 --> 08:32.214
Yes, we would! All right, fine.

08:32.333 --> 08:34.914
My assistant, Marilyn, will
call you back with the details.

08:34.919 --> 08:37.419
Is Marilyn hot?
What a bunch of morons.

08:37.421 --> 08:41.296
I can't believe these frittatas get to
go to camp and we can't go. I can't go.

08:41.416 --> 08:43.990
Babe! You're gonna go into
labor any minute... how can I

08:43.995 --> 08:46.094
leave you alone?
Do you remember what we did

08:46.098 --> 08:48.463
to Ruxin last year?
One of us has to make sure he

08:48.467 --> 08:50.557
doesn't pull that same shit on us.

08:51.512 --> 08:54.736
You're going. If you are not
gonna stay here and make love to

08:54.740 --> 08:59.441
this beautiful body... Oh... what do I
do, what do I do? What are you gonna do?

08:59.445 --> 09:04.746
I'm gonna go. Thank you so much! Oh... Mm.
I love you. I love you. Go. Have fun.

09:04.750 --> 09:08.250
Okay. All right. Say hi
to Jason Witten. I will.

09:08.254 --> 09:10.985
So hot. Oh. I won't.

09:10.989 --> 09:11.898
Good God.

09:18.764 --> 09:22.631
What's up, guys? Hey, fellas.
How you doing?

09:22.635 --> 09:25.300
Guys, ro-romo.
Tony...!

09:25.304 --> 09:28.202
What's up, guy?

09:28.206 --> 09:32.039
Right! Unbelievable.

09:32.041 --> 09:34.040
I've always talked about going
to a training camp, and here we

09:34.045 --> 09:39.140
are, Dallas Cowboys camp. Ooh...
Yes! I could do that.

09:39.260 --> 09:41.682
Play professional football?
Does that pay well?

09:41.687 --> 09:43.163
Yeah. For, like, two or three years.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.657
You know what, you may think
that this is great, but tonight

09:45.777 --> 09:49.391
is even gonna be better because
I have yelp'd one of the best

09:49.395 --> 09:51.493
sea urchin spots in all of Oxnard.

09:51.497 --> 09:53.494
Shut up, Andre.
All right, guys, I got to get to

09:53.499 --> 09:55.129
my meeting with Jerry Earl Jones.

09:55.133 --> 09:56.646
It's Jerry Jones. Jerry Earl Jones.

09:56.766 --> 09:58.942
No, James Earl Jones was Darth Vader.

09:59.062 --> 10:01.503
Yeah. Darth Vader owns the Dallas Cowboys.

10:01.507 --> 10:03.705
Okay, that's fine. Lawyers?

10:03.709 --> 10:05.124
Let's go.
Okay.

10:05.244 --> 10:07.865
Taco's making deals.
I remember our deal, that your

10:07.985 --> 10:11.153
championship stands and I get
naming rights to your child.

10:11.273 --> 10:12.962
You weren't really serious about that.

10:13.082 --> 10:16.518
Dead serious. Fine. Fine.

10:16.522 --> 10:19.253
Okay, just don't name him
something stupid, please.

10:19.255 --> 10:21.322
No, I'll find something that
goes well with McAsterisk.

10:21.327 --> 10:23.525
Hey, assholes. Let's go, we're late.

10:23.529 --> 10:25.593
So, I see you've brought
along your two lawyers.

10:25.597 --> 10:27.340
Uh, this guy's my actual lawyer.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.232
This underdressed human being
is my tagalong brother.

10:31.234 --> 10:33.701
Well, I can tell by this
business card here that I'm

10:33.706 --> 10:38.206
dealing with the cofounder
of the Taco Corporation.

10:38.210 --> 10:40.742
Should I respond?
You can respond.

10:40.744 --> 10:45.046
That is correct. Let's get down to brass tacks.
Jerry, my client has something

10:45.050 --> 10:48.182
that you want, and I'm sure
that we can reach a fair and

10:48.186 --> 10:50.184
agreeable price for that product.

10:50.186 --> 10:52.519
I don't know about this.
I may never have another idea as

10:52.524 --> 10:54.889
good as this one. That, I do not doubt.

10:54.893 --> 10:57.692
And just being here at this
training camp, I got to say,

10:57.694 --> 10:59.893
there are a lot of Cowboys out
there who'd be really good for

10:59.898 --> 11:01.963
my company.
So you really think my

11:01.967 --> 11:05.099
players had rather go tell
someone their dog had died or

11:05.103 --> 11:08.071
that they'd been fired than to
play professional football?

11:08.191 --> 11:11.008
They're both glamorous, but,
Jerry, I'm offering them a

11:11.128 --> 11:13.707
chance at a real career.
This is like talking to a

11:13.712 --> 11:15.574
mound of pudding.
On a good day, Sir.

11:15.694 --> 11:18.015
- Butterscotch pudding.
- Oh.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.626
So, let's cut the crap.
How much is this gonna cost me?

11:20.746 --> 11:23.818
Jer-bear, my client has a few
very specific demands...

11:23.822 --> 11:28.098
I want to be able to post whatever I
want on dallascowboys.com. Post what?

11:28.322 --> 11:31.893
Musings, pictures of shoes I
like, drawings of historical

11:31.897 --> 11:35.096
figures interacting with food
in unusual ways, portraits of

11:35.098 --> 11:38.733
people I know drawn from memory,
sex photos... No. What?

11:38.737 --> 11:40.039
Let me tell you how this is gonna happen.

11:40.159 --> 11:43.103
I'm gonna write a number down
on this piece of paper...

11:43.108 --> 11:47.341
And I drew a picture of myself
on this piece of paper.

11:47.345 --> 11:48.976
And this is going in the garbage.

11:48.980 --> 11:50.977
But that's a picture of me riding a tiger.

11:50.982 --> 11:53.681
No. He'll take this.
That works, that works.

11:53.685 --> 11:57.351
Taco, you just made $250,000. I'm sure he's

11:57.355 --> 11:58.942
gonna spend it wisely. That's a lot of

11:59.062 --> 12:01.288
butterscotch pudding.
Now, you chuckleheads, get

12:01.293 --> 12:06.428
your ass out of my office. And, you, put
that football back. Oh, this football.

12:06.432 --> 12:10.197
It's not mine. I'll put it back.
All right! Looking good!

12:10.201 --> 12:12.678
Well, Taco is rich.
Rich to Taco is, like, having

12:12.798 --> 12:15.710
20 bucks and a can of four loko.
No, like... you rich.

12:15.830 --> 12:18.840
How's it feel, Taco? Eh.
I've been rich before.

12:18.844 --> 12:21.509
Well, guys, money comes and
goes, but the draft order is

12:21.513 --> 12:24.011
forever. And as your Commissioner, I have

12:24.015 --> 12:26.781
devised an amazing way to figure it out.

12:26.785 --> 12:31.319
Okay, well, try and top this. Hey, Jason,
Felix, come on over, guys. Holy shit!

12:31.323 --> 12:33.788
What's up, fellas? How's it going?

12:33.792 --> 12:36.190
Hey, what's up? Good to see you, man.

12:36.192 --> 12:38.191
Hey, you must be Rodney.
You didn't play me last year

12:38.196 --> 12:39.745
against Tampa bay. What's up with that?

12:39.865 --> 12:42.730
It was a mistake on my part.
And everybody calls me Ruxin.

12:42.734 --> 12:44.731
Well, I'm gonna call you Rodney, Rodney.

12:44.734 --> 12:46.366
Well, I'm gonna call you Felix, Felix.

12:46.371 --> 12:48.009
Rodney. Felix.

12:48.129 --> 12:49.734
Rodney. Oh.

12:49.854 --> 12:51.578
Wait, how did you know who he was?

12:51.698 --> 12:53.807
Oh, he showed us the hall of records.

12:53.810 --> 12:55.642
It's amazing you guys are
putting all that stuff on the

12:55.647 --> 12:57.289
Internet. People actually look

12:57.409 --> 12:59.646
at that stuff, you know.
By the way, Kev, lost some

12:59.649 --> 13:01.247
weight since all those naked photos, huh?

13:01.252 --> 13:03.852
And I just want you guys to
know that I've totally, uh,

13:03.854 --> 13:05.853
slept with more than four women.
Like, it's more like

13:05.858 --> 13:08.222
upwards of five. Upwards of five?

13:08.226 --> 13:12.225
What's upwards mean? I totally, like,
French-kissed a nipple. Oh, my God.

13:12.230 --> 13:14.068
Right. All right.
We got you guys something.

13:14.188 --> 13:16.498
Jack. Ty. What's this?

13:16.502 --> 13:19.000
Oh... autographed, too?

13:19.004 --> 13:21.669
Gonna put this in the office.
Now that you guys got the

13:21.673 --> 13:24.038
football, try to score.
Wh-what do you mean?

13:24.040 --> 13:26.172
You're gonna start on this end
of the field, you're gonna

13:26.175 --> 13:28.174
get to the other end zone,
with the ball, of course.

13:28.179 --> 13:30.378
Through the practice?
Yep, through the practice.

13:30.382 --> 13:34.382
First person in the end zone gets the
first pick in the draft. Whoa. Wait.

13:34.386 --> 13:36.584
Wait, are we gonna start...

13:36.588 --> 13:39.854
Oh! Okay, all right!

13:39.858 --> 13:45.226
Why are we running?
Wait, wait... wait for me!

13:45.230 --> 13:47.529
Get out of here!

13:50.042 --> 13:53.234
Uh, coach Eckhart's here. Run, run!

13:55.574 --> 14:00.408
Run, Andre!

14:00.412 --> 14:02.443
Got him!

14:02.447 --> 14:05.046
Ow!

14:05.050 --> 14:07.982
Ha-ha! Up yours, Felix!

14:07.986 --> 14:09.984
Rodney! Eyes up!

14:09.988 --> 14:12.587
See what you're hitting, buddy.
Ha-ha-ha, I got this!

14:12.591 --> 14:15.122
Ho-ho-ho-ho! Aw, shit! Aw, shit!

14:15.126 --> 14:17.324
Come on! No, no, not today, buddy.

14:17.328 --> 14:19.393
You're looking tired, Rudy. Not today.

14:19.397 --> 14:25.332
Yeah, take care! Woo! Oh, yeah, first
pick, first pick, first pick!

14:25.336 --> 14:29.335
Oh!  You don't steal from the
Cowboys, you don't score on the Cowboys.

14:29.340 --> 14:31.338
Aah! What?!

14:31.342 --> 14:36.277
N-nothing. I have a present for you,
Mr. Ratliff, Sir. Thank you. I got this.

14:36.281 --> 14:39.480
Streaker! Woo! Hey, come on, man!

14:39.484 --> 14:43.117
Taco, no one wants to see your junk.

14:43.121 --> 14:49.891
Second base... third base...
Home run! Woo! Woo! Yes!

14:50.011 --> 14:52.460
First pick of the draft! Ha-ha-ha!

14:52.464 --> 14:54.625
Unh, unh, unh, unh! What's your name?

14:54.745 --> 14:56.709
Brandon Carter.
You don't look like a kicker.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.994
But guess what? You're my first pick.

14:59.114 --> 15:00.853
Give me a hug. I'm not touching that.

15:00.973 --> 15:02.856
Ooh! Ooh! That is refreshing. Taco, here.

15:02.976 --> 15:06.291
Come on! Cover your taco
bells, please. Oh! Oh!

15:06.411 --> 15:08.814
I win! Suck it! Suck it! Hey!

15:08.934 --> 15:12.714
Mr. Jones is willing to let you use his
private plane to go home. Yeah! Yeah!

15:12.718 --> 15:13.851
Cool! If you leave right now.

15:13.971 --> 15:16.450
Oh. We go that way then?

15:16.454 --> 15:21.089
Go! Oh, the exit... Okay. See you guys.
I knew I could play football!

15:33.241 --> 15:36.039
Ugh! Those shit sippers.

15:37.071 --> 15:40.704
They're at goddamn cowboy camp
right now, and I'm just here,

15:40.708 --> 15:44.074
beached. You know what? Fine.

15:44.078 --> 15:48.178
Mama's just gonna stay here by herself...
and get happy.

15:48.182 --> 15:53.583
Mmm. Oh, yeah!

15:53.587 --> 15:55.587
Ah! Oh, yeah.

15:59.760 --> 16:03.529
Okay. Hey, Jenny.

16:03.649 --> 16:05.843
It's Jason Witten. Hey, Jason.

16:05.963 --> 16:08.718
How you doing? I'd love to be on your team.

16:08.838 --> 16:11.578
Yeah, you can be on my team, Jason.

16:12.252 --> 16:14.808
Hey, Jenny. What's up, girl?
This is Desean.

16:14.928 --> 16:18.421
Oh, hey, Desean. You draft me, I'm talking

16:18.425 --> 16:21.355
about two touchdowns a game.
Oh, I want all your TDS.

16:21.475 --> 16:23.068
And don't forget about the punt returns.

16:23.188 --> 16:27.930
Oh, I won't. Oh, shit!

16:27.934 --> 16:30.299
Desean Jackson! Kevin!

16:30.303 --> 16:32.262
I-I won't say anything.
It's cool. I'll just watch.

16:32.382 --> 16:36.138
No. Get out of here.
Desean is the only man I want

16:36.142 --> 16:42.177
to talk to right now. Oh, God, my team's
gonna be so good this year. Hi, Jenny.

16:42.181 --> 16:46.081
Shiva? It's me, Shiva.

16:46.085 --> 16:49.351
Oh, my God! Wow.

16:49.355 --> 16:52.822
You know, you're the only one
of these shit-sipping frittatas

16:52.826 --> 16:55.658
I can relate to?
Oh, my God, is this my year?

16:55.662 --> 16:58.828
It's our year. Totally.

16:58.832 --> 17:01.096
Totally. Totally!

17:01.100 --> 17:03.533
Totally. Totally.

17:03.537 --> 17:07.336
Totally. Oh, Shiva!

17:07.339 --> 17:15.109
Mmm. Oh, you know what? I don't...
Oh, no, it's good. Awesome!

17:15.114 --> 17:17.007
No, Kevin. It's my fantasy. Go away!

17:17.127 --> 17:23.018
Um... this isn't
really gonna work for me. No. Shiva!

17:23.021 --> 17:25.387
God, Kevin! Oh, come on, Jenny!

17:25.391 --> 17:29.559
Jenny? Jenny?

17:29.563 --> 17:31.694
Jenny? Oh, God, Kevin, go away!

17:31.696 --> 17:35.565
Jenny? Jenny? Oh, Shiva! Shiva! Oh, Shi...
Jenny, stop it. Stop doing it.

17:35.569 --> 17:38.367
Shiva komedi somakanakram.
Jenny... come on, babe.

17:38.371 --> 17:40.369
Listen. Hello! Oh, my God!

17:40.373 --> 17:42.404
Hello?! Oh!

17:42.408 --> 17:44.405
What are you doing?!
You don't recognize your own

17:44.410 --> 17:46.407
wife's vinegar strokes?
I wasn't doing that.

17:46.410 --> 17:49.262
Whoa. It's onto her and her baby's soul...
both not great.

17:49.382 --> 17:53.262
No. Jenny, you were flicking that bean
like mean Joe Greene. No, I wasn't.

17:53.382 --> 17:55.248
Your pants are all wet. Oh, my God.

17:55.251 --> 17:59.253
I think my water just broke. Is that
how a lady says she's coming? What?

17:59.255 --> 18:01.254
I think I'm having the baby.
Right-right-right now?

18:01.259 --> 18:03.290
Yeah.
Okay, if it's amniotic fluid,

18:03.292 --> 18:05.124
it will smell sweet. Let me take a look.

18:05.129 --> 18:06.643
Stop it!
What? What?

18:06.763 --> 18:07.958
You're doing really well.

18:08.078 --> 18:09.367
You're about eight centimeters dilated.

18:09.503 --> 18:13.301
Oh! Continue to breathe through it...
breathe in and out. Doing great, babe.

18:13.306 --> 18:15.304
Steady breathing. Okay.

18:15.306 --> 18:17.238
What's the word? It's been 14 hours.

18:17.241 --> 18:19.207
This baby's not coming out.
Look, draft's about to start.

18:19.212 --> 18:21.310
You coming or what?
Just hold on one second.

18:21.314 --> 18:23.379
Nice. How are those contractions?

18:23.383 --> 18:25.381
Oh. Oh! Oh.

18:25.385 --> 18:28.511
They feel kind of like
that every couple minutes.

18:28.631 --> 18:30.584
About every three minutes. Thank you.

18:30.588 --> 18:32.585
We're not gonna make it.

18:32.588 --> 18:35.032
Whatever, caption auto draft.
Has the draft started?

18:35.152 --> 18:36.951
Yeah, but you know what?
We'll do the draft from here.

18:36.956 --> 18:39.154
Yeah. I got a phone. Okay, good.

18:39.156 --> 18:41.121
Oh, here we go. Don't worry. Really. Okay.

18:41.124 --> 18:42.990
Okay, good, good, good, breathe. Breathe.

18:42.993 --> 18:44.051
All right, this is good.
Breathe and tell me your

18:44.171 --> 18:44.970
thoughts on Adrian Peterson. What?

18:45.106 --> 18:46.273
Where are you picking? Third.

18:46.393 --> 18:48.883
Are you crazy?! God. I know.
I don't know. I...

18:49.003 --> 18:51.441
He's on the B.U.B. still. Mr.
McArthur, can we let her

18:51.446 --> 18:54.402
concentrate here, please? Yes, of course.

18:54.522 --> 18:56.521
Adrian Peterson's a beast,
but it did happen week 16.

18:56.526 --> 18:58.723
What do you think about that ACL?

18:58.727 --> 19:00.345
Listen to me! You are about to become the

19:00.465 --> 19:03.261
father of a boy, and I would be
remiss in my duties if I did not

19:03.264 --> 19:05.663
tell you that I think Adrian
Peterson, any time before the

19:05.668 --> 19:09.795
third round, is nuts. Yup.

19:09.915 --> 19:12.868
No running back has ever come
back from an ACL to have a good

19:12.988 --> 19:15.096
season the following year
with the exception of deuce

19:15.218 --> 19:17.766
McAllister, and he was 22
years old at the time.

19:17.886 --> 19:19.883
Just what he said.
What kind of league is this,

19:19.888 --> 19:20.893
anyway? It's an eight-man league.

19:21.013 --> 19:23.887
That's child's play.
Let's focus on this, okay?

19:23.890 --> 19:25.889
Yes. Oh, oh. Oh, here we go!
Okay, keep breathing.

19:25.894 --> 19:26.551
Keep breathing now. Okay, here it comes.

19:26.671 --> 19:28.201
Now don't push.
Get your mitt and your pail.

19:28.318 --> 19:30.187
Get it out. We don't use... We
don't use a mitt or a pail.

19:30.307 --> 19:31.847
Having my baby. Let's get this baby out.

19:31.967 --> 19:32.989
Let's keep breathing here. Come on, baby.

19:33.229 --> 19:34.379
There you go... hey, hey, hey!

19:34.500 --> 19:36.431
Let's get ready to draft!
Excuse me. You guys have to

19:36.434 --> 19:39.461
wait outside. Well, the Commissioner is

19:39.555 --> 19:41.754
requiring that we draft here.

19:41.756 --> 19:45.196
All right, I love hospital parties.
Where is the bar?

19:45.316 --> 19:46.462
There's no bar.

19:46.582 --> 19:48.727
It's a hospital. It's America.

19:48.847 --> 19:50.490
There's always a bar. This cannot happen.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.587
You people cannot be in here.
No. They can stay.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.589
I want to make my own first-round pick.

19:54.594 --> 19:58.474
Oh, God! Okay, the baby is descending.

19:58.594 --> 20:00.458
It's time to push. All right!

20:00.462 --> 20:03.238
It's happening? Hey, Jenny, what's the
wifi password?

20:03.358 --> 20:04.600
Is that all caps or lower case?

20:04.711 --> 20:06.710
Doc, I'm gonna use the
bassinet for these stickers.

20:06.713 --> 20:10.742
They're basically sterile.
The bar is officially open.

20:10.862 --> 20:13.282
Who wants a screwdriver?
Okay, the baby is crowning.

20:14.189 --> 20:17.574
Oh, looking good, Jenny!
Hey, get back behind the line

20:17.694 --> 20:19.435
of scrimmage! Off sides, Andre!?

20:19.555 --> 20:20.713
Fine. Go!

20:21.070 --> 20:22.080
Shh, shh, shh. It's really good.

20:22.171 --> 20:26.632
So the Commissioner announces
that the draft will begin now.

20:26.752 --> 20:29.350
Jenny, I need you to ignore
your bullshit eight-man league

20:29.470 --> 20:31.068
and focus on your baby, please.
Yeah, just breathe.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.094
Oh, I can do both.
With the first pick in the

20:33.098 --> 20:35.863
draft, we have Taco.
And with my first pick, I

20:35.867 --> 20:38.666
would like to announce a trade. What?!

20:38.670 --> 20:40.145
What? Really?

20:40.265 --> 20:44.702
A trade? A who done it? Well, I'll
tell you who done did it. Oh.

20:44.950 --> 20:47.381
Arian Foster. Puh-pwap! No!

20:47.385 --> 20:49.120
Oh! Come on!

20:49.240 --> 20:51.421
You traded away your
first-round draft pick?

20:51.541 --> 20:53.419
What did you get in return? Naming rights.

20:53.539 --> 20:56.157
What? Kevin?! Push, Jenny, push!

20:56.159 --> 20:57.912
That's it.
Push for me! Push!

20:58.032 --> 20:59.873
One big push! Howdy, y'all.

20:59.993 --> 21:02.395
What the hell is this?
Is that cowboy sterile?

21:02.400 --> 21:06.567
I doubt it.
 ♪ There's a new Sheriff in town...
Come on, push, Jenny.

21:06.571 --> 21:11.139
Try to ignore them.
No! I don't want it like this!
♪ And this cowpoke's name

21:11.143 --> 21:18.192
is Chalupa Batman McArthur...
What the hell, Kevin?!

21:18.312 --> 21:20.710
Push. Push. Good. Push.

21:20.830 --> 21:23.450
One more big push, Jenny. There you go!

21:26.474 --> 21:30.465
We have a son!
♪ Chalupa Batman McArthur!

21:30.585 --> 21:31.770
Oh!

21:31.890 --> 21:34.115
See? Everything sounds
better coming from a cowboy.

21:34.235 --> 21:37.525
Oh, fuck you guys.
It is decided.

21:37.645 --> 21:41.344
Chalupa Batman.
Yee-haw!
