LUCY: Previously
on /(/7/joy5...

00:02.880 --> 00:05.940
Aneela?
Mother.

00:06.040 --> 00:08.144
I need you to give Lucy
the coordinates to the pulsar.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.299
JOH/V: The pu/sar’s not gone.
It’s hidden.

00:10.400 --> 00:12.425
By a fake black hole.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.897
Once I introduce this
compound Into the plasma,

00:15.000 --> 00:16.501
it will kill everyone
linked with the Green,

00:16.600 --> 00:17.919
and this WI7/ a// be over.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.103
Look what she's dripping.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.145
The Lady has a Greenpool.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.344
What are you doing here?
What's that for?

00:23.440 --> 00:25.146
I think I should go.
No, no, no, you stay.

00:25.240 --> 00:26.662
This is part
of your training, too.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.625
Self-defense is one thing,
but that was something else.

00:28.720 --> 00:30.187
The Lady wants him,

00:30.280 --> 00:31.907
and he is the key
to stopping her.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.707
He is special, and I can
train him to be a weapon.

00:34.800 --> 00:37.143
What am I?
You're my son.

00:37.240 --> 00:38.457
Pack your bags.

00:38.600 --> 00:39.988
We're gonna hit the road.

00:42.520 --> 00:45.546
LUCY: Approach/77g 7'e/en.
Welcome home, Johnny.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.221
So, very
important question,

00:47.320 --> 00:49.663
dark boots or the slightly
darker boots?

00:49.760 --> 00:52.661
This is an extraction, Johnny,
not popping down to Telen

00:52.760 --> 00:54.387
for a home-cooked meal
and fresh laundry.

00:54.480 --> 00:57.825
Yes, but our slingshot around Kupri
got us here way ahead of the Hullen,

00:57.920 --> 01:00.104
and I always have time for
looking sexy.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.100
So? Huh?

01:02.600 --> 01:03.737
Steel-toe ones, then.

01:03.840 --> 01:05.580
Best for kicking
your brother's ass.

01:05.680 --> 01:08.137
You sure you don't want
to be the one to do it?

01:08.240 --> 01:10.504
It's gonna be weird enough for
D'Av when you show up.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.103
LUCY: John, I’m sending
you a sat map.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.747
Shit.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.228
What is it, D'Av or Hullen?

01:16.320 --> 01:18.823
Worse, a silica storm.

01:18.920 --> 01:20.820
What, are you afraid
of a little bad weather?

01:20.920 --> 01:23.980
More like Telen's answer to black rain,
but with the world's shittiest sand.

01:24.080 --> 01:26.139
It'll strip the flesh
from your bones in minutes.

01:26.240 --> 01:27.901
Get above the atmo
as soon as I'm gone.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.740
Scanners and _come
are already frItzed.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.909
I'm gonna be flying blind.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.706
Look, if you need an evac
once you find D'Av,

01:32.800 --> 01:34.301
the safest place is
the eye of the storm.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.300
Lucy will find you.
LUCY:
[always
do-.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.719
Appreciate it, ladies.

01:37.800 --> 01:40.223
Plus side, I know exactly
where to find D'Av now.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.697
Our fem/Yy’s got one ”break
glass
in case of emergency" place.

01:44.760 --> 01:46.625
Just better
be breaking it fast.

01:46.720 --> 01:49.746
They got about 20 minutes
before it hits.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.019
Can we go back
to Utopia now?

01:57.480 --> 01:59.220
Still no.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.541
There's sand in my boots.

02:05.640 --> 02:06.959
It's silica dust.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.939
There's silica in my boots.

02:10.040 --> 02:12.907
Are we ever gonna see Dutch
and Uncle Johnny again?

02:13.640 --> 02:14.664
(SIGHS)

02:17.800 --> 02:18.937
Did I do something wrong?

02:21.000 --> 02:23.139
No.
Then why are we here?

02:23.240 --> 02:24.457
It's about keeping you safe.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.221
Is safe always this boring?

02:26.320 --> 02:27.787
This is Kipsey County, bud.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.381
Most kids would kill
to come here,

02:29.480 --> 02:33.507
campfires, silica sliders,
pit diving.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.227
So,boflng.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.747
We had to stop aging you
at teenager.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.020
It's just for one night.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.145
Your grandmother left something
that I need to pick up

02:44.240 --> 02:47.220
so I can take you somewhere
safe and not boring.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.419
_ Grandma.
WIll I get to meet her?

02:51.520 --> 02:54.546

How the hells long
has it been, huh?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.945
"Welcome"? You opened
fire on us.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.019
You live to my age

03:44.160 --> 03:47.266
occasionally mistake a
person for a sand bear, huh?

03:47.360 --> 03:49.066
And they let
you keep your guns.

03:50.680 --> 03:51.942
What is this place?

03:52.040 --> 03:53.940
The Jaqobis
family cabin.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.339
Can I look around?
Yeah, go nuts.

03:58.440 --> 04:01.944
Yeah, helped build it
with my father.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.065
Now, I know what
you're thinking, young fella.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.946
"Cabin?

04:06.040 --> 04:07.507
"Looks like a bunker."

04:07.640 --> 04:10.302

effect of the planet's rings...

04:10.400 --> 04:11.583

04:11.680 --> 04:13.466

04:13.560 --> 04:16.461

even know what a cabin is.

Help me
with the air filter.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.781
So a little shore-leave action
came back to haunt you?

04:35.600 --> 04:38.626
Mama hunt you down
and dump him on your doorstep?

04:39.840 --> 04:41.660
And you were planning
on telling me when?

04:41.800 --> 04:43.427
I wasn't planning
on telling you anything.

04:45.120 --> 04:48.339
I know we've had our issues,
but I'm a changed man.

04:54.840 --> 04:57.479
But you weren't you.
You were this...

04:57.560 --> 05:00.586

of silver-haired scientist

us a way back into greenspace.

for running off with Pip?

06:41.040 --> 06:42.428
Depends. Did it work?

06:42.520 --> 06:44.021
Depends. Did you get the
spiderbot out of his brain?

about the night you joined the army?

It's complicated.

07:15.120 --> 07:17.543
Well, anyways,
your father?

07:17.640 --> 07:20.586
He had some behavior issues
that got him into trouble.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.944
I'm the one with
behavioral issues. Really?

07:23.040 --> 07:24.985
So I was sheriff
at the time,

07:25.080 --> 07:26.980
and I knew what kind of life
he was looking at

07:27.080 --> 07:29.457
if he didn't straighten
himself out.

07:29.560 --> 07:32.779
He asked my advice,
talked it out, man-to-man.

that he hid them up here.

gave a damn about wompball.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.986
Zeph, do you really want to be
talking about boys right now?

10:35.080 --> 10:37.719
0h, Gods, no. Nope. I would
rather drink my own sick.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.461
Then let's just
science, okay?

10:39.560 --> 10:42.347
SO how do we stop the spore from
dying before I can even use it?

10:42.440 --> 10:44.226
Well, spores
are simple organisms.

10:44.320 --> 10:47.505
Taking it apart on your end should
allow me to re-create it here.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.465
Take it apart how?

10:49.560 --> 10:51.983
A centrifuge, obvious/y.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.344
Right, yeah, obviously.

10:54.440 --> 10:55.464
Do I have one of those?

10:56.080 --> 10:57.183
Mmm.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.304
There.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.460
Centrifugal force is how we 7/ separate
the components from the spore base,

11:01.560 --> 11:05.906
//ke how a salad spinner
pu/Ls water away from salad.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.582
How you toss your salad
is between you and Pip.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.139
Okay, we need to work
on your dirtyjoke game.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.185
That would have killed
with Johnny.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.304
(GASPS)

11:29.480 --> 11:34.258
Great, your dad's a badass,
and you get scared by laundry.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.264
There you are.

11:43.880 --> 11:46.440
Hey, hey, it's okay.
It's me.

11:47.760 --> 11:48.863
Shh...

11:49.960 --> 11:51.587
JAQ: Hullen?

11:52.120 --> 11:53.860
GO, go:

12:00.400 --> 12:01.389
Made it.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.740
Johnny?
Johnny?

12:04.840 --> 12:06.740
Hey, Pops, how are things?
Good? Peachy.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.341
D'Av, we got to go now.
What the hells is going on?

12:08.440 --> 12:10.146
Where's Dutch?
Avoiding you.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.743
Also finding us an exit. We got
a squad Of Black Root incoming.

12:12.840 --> 12:14.341
What the hell
is a Black Root?

12:14.440 --> 12:16.305
What kind of shit have you
boys tracked onto my rug?

12:16.400 --> 12:18.186
What are you gonna do?
Ground us?

12:18.280 --> 12:19.383
Nice.
Oh.

12:19.480 --> 12:20.583
(CLANGING)

12:20.680 --> 12:22.819
Shit.
I thought I lost them.

12:22.920 --> 12:24.820
Dad, take him to the
back Of the cabin.

12:24.920 --> 12:26.547
Barricade yourselves in,
wait for our signal.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.864
Don't tell me what to do
In my goddamn home!

12:28.960 --> 12:30.302
Do it.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.618
Jaq, everything's gonna be okay.
Just wait for us.

12:35.160 --> 12:38.061
SO, best family
reunion ever?

12:41.040 --> 12:43.065
(WIND HOWLING)

12:47.680 --> 12:48.817
They cut the power.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.137
Yeah, that's just
the first move.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.741
We got to fortify before
they breach.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.347
I got trip charges in my pack.
No,no,no.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.987
No power, no filter.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.661
This place will be filled up
with silica in an hour,

12:56.760 --> 12:57.943
so they won't
have to come in.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.541
They'll just wait
and smoke us out.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.298
We can't get
this thing back online.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.903
What are the chances that Dad
maintained the sand suits?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.945
Sand suits? What do you
need sand suits for?

13:07.040 --> 13:08.223
Why aren't you
with Jaq?

13:08.320 --> 13:09.821
I_ can walk _
around In my own cabin!

13:09.920 --> 13:11.626
Mom's cabin.
I asked you to do one thing.

13:11.720 --> 13:14.280
One!
He's 13, he's fine.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.920
Would someone please tell me
what the hells is going on?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.103
It's complicated.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.464
I was a goddamn sheriff
for 35 years, try me.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.027
Okay-

13:23.480 --> 13:25.664
Jaq is the product
of merging the DNA of D'Av

13:25.760 --> 13:27.307
and a 275-year-Old woman

13:27.400 --> 13:29.300
who disappeared
in a trans-dimensional space,

13:29.400 --> 13:32.107
and now we're being hunted
by her undying enemy.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.661
Fine, don't tell me!

13:34.760 --> 13:37.024
Eldest son is AWOL
from the army,

13:37.120 --> 13:39.543
youngest is doing who knows
what shit with his life.

13:39.640 --> 13:42.302
Actually, Dad,
I'm a Killjoy now.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.469
Level Five.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.143
Oh, no, you don't.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.740
A bounty hunter?

13:54.600 --> 13:56.306
Bullshit.

13:59.720 --> 14:00.857
Can I help?

14:04.640 --> 14:05.709
They're trying
to get in.

14:09.160 --> 14:10.900
Hey, it's Okay to be scared.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.820
I'm not scared.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.265
Were you scared
when you went into the army?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.342
Yeah.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.305
But Grandpa
said you wanted to go.

14:22.400 --> 14:26.461
Grandpa likes to tell stories, but
he doesn't always get it right.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.267
(METAL SCRAPPING)

14:30.160 --> 14:33.186
You know, your Grandpa and I
didn't just not get along.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.305
He was mean.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.062
And when he drank, he would
take it out on Johnny.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.378
But Uncle Johnny's the best.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.107
Yeah, but Johnny had a way

14:42.200 --> 14:44.760
of getting under the Old
man's skin, which meant

14:44.840 --> 14:47.024
he'd take a beating.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.224
SO, more often than not,

14:49.320 --> 14:51.060
I would take it for him.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.225
One night,

14:53.320 --> 14:55.379
I had enough

14:55.520 --> 14:58.341
and I fought back hard.

14:58.760 --> 15:00.079
(TICKING)

15:00.160 --> 15:02.025
Next thing I knew,

15:02.120 --> 15:04.065
I was in the army.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.947
But you came back a man.

15:08.520 --> 15:10.465
That's not how
you become a man.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.344
But Grandpa said when
he sent me into the tunnels...

15:14.280 --> 15:15.622
He did what?

15:17.360 --> 15:20.784
SO, Killjoy,
huh? (CHUCKLES)

15:23.040 --> 15:25.986
Guess you got a real job
there now, huh?

15:27.120 --> 15:28.337
Thanks.

15:28.440 --> 15:31.079
I guess you finally learned
how to read worth a damn.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.906
And there it is.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.266
Did you send Jaq
into the tunnels?

15:35.360 --> 15:36.463
SO what if I did?

15:36.560 --> 15:37.879
You could have
got him killed.

15:37.960 --> 15:40.417
Please. He was jumping
at his own shadow.

15:40.520 --> 15:43.102
He can't grow up in a bubble.
He's not in a bubble.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.542
I'm in a sand suit.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.104
Okay, bad timing.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.419
I did the sggne for him
I did for
YOU,
as
the old man did for me.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.465
Look what happens when you
don't toughen them up.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.187
Hey, you have no idea
what I do.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.987
Oh, please, you fly around
drinking and getting into trouble.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.399
No!

16:00.560 --> 16:01.743
Sometimes.

16:02.480 --> 16:03.868
It's not like I had
a great example.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.337
You got something
to say to me, JJ?

16:06.440 --> 16:08.101
Sound off like
you got a paIr.

16:10.800 --> 16:14.622
SO, after all these years, I still
got a smart-mouth, slacker,

16:14.720 --> 16:18.065
and now a bastard
bed wetter to deal with.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.503
Say that again about my son.
I can still smack you, boy.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.147
Hey! Both of you!
Go ahead!

16:22.680 --> 16:24.545
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
(LOUD EXPLOSION)

16:25.080 --> 16:26.104
Jaq.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.222
You okay?
I'm Okay.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.344
Okay-

16:31.440 --> 16:33.067
Trip wire
caught something.

16:40.720 --> 16:41.823
Come on.

16:42.640 --> 16:44.141
He's Black Root.

16:44.240 --> 16:45.662
We got to restrain him
before he recovers.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.057
All right, I got him.
I got him here.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.225
That bastard
is dead, son.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.821
Nah, Hullen
are very resilient.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.822
Damn.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.346
Storm tunnels are clear.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.862
His friends
must have fallen back.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.342
Well, they're coming in,
that's for sure.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.657
We have to take
the fight to them.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.421
No, no, we stick to the
plan with the suits.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.657
We head to the eye
of the storm and Dutch.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.546
No, Dad's right.
Excuse me?

17:10.640 --> 17:12.107
What?
Even if we go topside,

17:12.200 --> 17:13.224
they're gonna come after us.

17:13.320 --> 17:15.060
Hullen don't need
suits like we do.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.060
Dad and I will hold them down.
You get Jaq off planet.

17:17.160 --> 17:18.741
I need you to stay
with your uncle.

17:18.840 --> 17:21.741
No! Dad, you can't go. You
said you wouldn't leave me.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.341
I said I wouldn't let
anything happen to you.

17:23.440 --> 17:24.623
And I won't, okay?

17:26.880 --> 17:28.859
Whatever happens, I'm
gonna come back for you.

17:31.560 --> 17:32.663
You ready?

17:32.760 --> 17:34.227
Yeah.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.680
Johnny, the storm's messing
with Lucy's readings,

17:46.760 --> 17:51.379
but I'm detecting between four to seven
new bio signals in the tunnel with you.

17:52.360 --> 17:53.782
Johnny?

17:53.880 --> 17:55.347
LUCY: The charged particles
in the atmosphere

17:55.440 --> 17:57.863
are disrupt/ng my ab/lity
to connect with Johnny.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.939
Okay, keep trying-

18:00.040 --> 18:01.780
ZL-‘PH’. This is the Shit; n'ght?

18:01.880 --> 18:04.860
Theories, hypotheses,
answers right and wrong.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.269
This Ls where
the magic happens.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.748
We need to get you
drinking more.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.024
Ooh. Wh/le we wait; want to
play ”Guess My Hypothesis ”?

18:11.120 --> 18:12.587
Is it a drinking game?
No.

18:12.680 --> 18:13.863
But also, do you need help?

18:15.200 --> 18:17.862
The game is, I make a
hypothes/s, then you do.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.587
You play your way,
I'll play mine.

18:19.680 --> 18:23.787
Okay. Spores are how plants,
algae, and fungi reproduce.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.747
The Hullen parasite relies
on a host organ/ism

18:26.840 --> 18:28.501
in a symbiotic
relationship.

18:28.600 --> 18:32.104
Well, nothing disrupts a symbiotic
relationship like reproducing.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.587
Okay, so, again, I feel him
this is not about the science.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.459
50g of
whiskey dick.
What?

18:40.560 --> 18:42.619
The centrifuge isn ’t
separating the spore.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.177
Whatever this compound is,
it repairs its bonds

18:45.280 --> 18:47.589
faster than centrifugal force
can pull them apart.

18:47.680 --> 18:49.341
SO we spin faster.
Up the G-force.

18:49.480 --> 18:50.663
At the rate
this thing heals,

18:50.760 --> 18:52.660
you’d have to hurl yourself
against the sun is gravity

18:52.760 --> 18:54.580
I mean, thats not just...

18:54.680 --> 18:55.749
What?

18:55.840 --> 18:57.580
Any sun?

19:04.280 --> 19:06.225
It's gonna be okay, champ.

19:06.320 --> 19:07.582
No, it's not.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.864
Dad and Grandpa
are going to get hurt.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.342
I can see it.

19:11.440 --> 19:14.307
What?
I can

19:14.400 --> 19:17.540
remember things
before they happen.

19:17.640 --> 19:20.746
Well, that's unique.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.787
What do you remember
right now?

19:25.880 --> 19:29.020
You and Dad and Grandpa,

19:29.120 --> 19:32.260
you're all close together.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.426
It's dark,
and I'm in trouble.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.506
But no one's coming
to save me.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.580
Well, no Offense, champ, but
that's how I know you're wrong,

19:43.680 --> 19:45.784
because,one,

19:45.880 --> 19:47.507
there's no way your father
wouldn't save you.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.624
And, two,

19:49.760 --> 19:52.547
Jaqobis haven't
been close, ever.

19:52.640 --> 19:55.302
Is that why you let Grandpa
send my dad to the army?

19:56.080 --> 19:57.468
No, that's not how
that happened.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.899
Whatever happens, stay hidden.
Go, go, gO!

20:04.080 --> 20:05.900
Stop.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.139
Identify yourself.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.617
I said identify yourself!

20:13.520 --> 20:14.623
Put the gun down.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.706
Nah-uh. You first.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.906
You know, last I checked,
Hullen don't need gas masks.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.503
No, but sheriffs do.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.786
Charlie?

20:25.880 --> 20:27.017
Charlie Volford?

20:27.160 --> 20:30.857
Johnny godsdamn Jaqobis.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.266
How the hell are you?

20:39.600 --> 20:42.262
Okay, on my 9-

20:46.320 --> 20:47.639
Head shots only!

20:50.880 --> 20:52.097
What the hells?

20:52.400 --> 20:53.389
(GRUNTING)

20:53.520 --> 20:54.908
Dad!

20:55.000 --> 20:57.184
I told you, head shots only!
Stay behind me!

20:57.280 --> 20:59.862
I've been a lawman for 35 years!
I get behind nobody.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.622
Come on, you sons of bitches!
No! Dad!

21:02.720 --> 21:05.780
Come on!
Dad! Dad!

21:07.080 --> 21:08.104
Shit!

21:11.640 --> 21:15.462
D'Av? D'Av? D'Av!

21:16.280 --> 21:18.384
D'Avw!
He hates that, you know.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.663
Oh, I know.

21:19.760 --> 21:23.423
Do belly buttons ever get mad that
mouths put them out of business?

21:24.360 --> 21:26.260

I'm giving her the finger.
Can she see it?

32:44.880 --> 32:46.620
Probably not.

32:46.720 --> 32:48.426
Look, Charlie,
you have kids.

32:48.520 --> 32:50.021
And they both
need food, clothing,

32:50.120 --> 32:52.099
all of that on a public
servant's salary.

32:52.240 --> 32:54.663
Money for intel, that's all
this was supposed to be.

32:54.760 --> 32:56.785
It's not_too late.
We can still help you.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.064
(CHUCKLES)

32:58.440 --> 33:02.024
Some of us don't get to fly
away on a boosted ship

33:02.120 --> 33:04.304
looking for
Velubian princesses.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.265
(GASPS)
Did I get them?

33:11.360 --> 33:13.146
No, Dad, you didn't.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.227
Where am I?

33:15.320 --> 33:18.062
Oh, shit. What did you
boys do now?

33:24.680 --> 33:26.864
I'll signal once
the ship is ready.

33:26.960 --> 33:29.099
Stay here with
the First Born.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.379
I was expecting something more

33:33.240 --> 33:34.662
impressive.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.100
I hope she's right
about him.

33:49.040 --> 33:50.860
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)

34:09.240 --> 34:10.423
(GROANS)

34:15.400 --> 34:17.709
Want to know _
how you're gonna die?

34:24.840 --> 34:26.819
(ALARM BLARING)

34:37.320 --> 34:41.586
Lucy, disengage
manual controls.

34:41.680 --> 34:44.319
LUCY: Emergency
auto-reroute mit/a/ized.

34:44.400 --> 34:47.221
(WHOOPS)
Yes, Yes, yes, yes!

34:50.240 --> 34:51.423
I am the worst dad.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.385
I am the flaming garbage
heap of dads.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.698
Trust me,
no matter what you do,

34:55.800 --> 34:58.587
no matter how hard you try,
it's never enough.

34:58.680 --> 34:59.817
Hey,Dad.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.660
What, Johnny?
Shut up.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.380
Why do I smell burning?

35:07.800 --> 35:10.303
(GRUNTING)

35:11.920 --> 35:13.387
Dad's mini-laze.

35:13.480 --> 35:15.619
What'd I say about
borrowing my tools?

35:15.720 --> 35:17.187
Thanks for the loan.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.819
(COUGHING)

35:21.240 --> 35:23.424
Now all we have to do
is get this door open,

35:23.520 --> 35:25.101
and we can save...

35:25.200 --> 35:27.179
Jaq.
I did it. I got out.

35:28.520 --> 35:31.307
They tied me up, but I did what
Auntie Dutch taught me and got out.

35:31.440 --> 35:33.624
And I hit a Hullen
guard in the head!

35:33.720 --> 35:35.506
Are you crazy? You could
have been hurt or killed.

35:35.600 --> 35:38.387
But I'm okay!
And I did it on my own.

35:38.800 --> 35:39.983
And look what I found.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.783
Guns.

35:46.480 --> 35:47.868
My boy brought guns.

35:49.800 --> 35:50.869
Can he have one?

35:55.360 --> 35:56.827
Fine.

35:56.920 --> 35:59.184
But stay
with your uncle, okay?

35:59.280 --> 36:01.305
And make sure
you leave it on "stun."

36:01.400 --> 36:04.665
Trust me, Jaq, you never
forget your first firefight.

36:22.240 --> 36:24.265
He's gonna be fine.

36:24.880 --> 36:27.701
Just like you.
SO I'm fine now.

36:28.400 --> 36:30.106
Look at you,

36:30.200 --> 36:32.304
big-time Killjoy, huh?

36:33.040 --> 36:34.940
I guess I did
something right, huh?

36:35.040 --> 36:36.462
Yeah, I guess so.

36:37.440 --> 36:38.509
Yeah, well,

36:39.840 --> 36:41.307
I did the best I could.

36:42.920 --> 36:44.706
No, you didn't.

36:47.360 --> 36:48.987
But I Will.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.863
You could have been k/l/ed.
You should have been k/l/ed.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.177
But you saved me

37:01.320 --> 37:03.584
so we can re-create the
spore, so I call that a Win.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.864
You gagged me and forced me
to almost watch you die.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.706
So what do you call that?
Teamwork.

37:07.800 --> 37:09.700
Anyway, I say it calls
for a drink.

37:09.800 --> 37:11.301
5177/ a hologram.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.539
Maybe you could warm it up for me.
I kind of fancy a hot toddy.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.389
Too soon?

37:17.480 --> 37:19.698
I get that n'sking everything
for everyone is what you do,

37:19.840 --> 37:21.819
but literal/y shutting out the
people that care about you

37:21.920 --> 37:23.740
when all they’re trying to do
Ls save your life

37:23.840 --> 37:25.387
Ls not so badass,

37:27.760 --> 37:29.341
Is this about Pip?
No!

37:29.440 --> 37:30.782
Maybe.

37:30.880 --> 37:32.905
Look, I just...

37:33.000 --> 37:35.560
I don ’t want .
my fnends to d/e.

37:35.640 --> 37:36.857
Okay?

37:36.960 --> 37:38.860
I ’rn greedy him that.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.501
How bad is he?

37:46.560 --> 37:50.144
If I cut out the spider,
I k/l/ him.

37:51.120 --> 37:54.863
And if/ lea ve it in,
the spider k/lLs him.

38:00.080 --> 38:03.265
Then, you do
what you do best.

38:05.520 --> 38:06.908
Face the truth.

38:08.360 --> 38:10.385
We'_|| kick its ass
With SCIence.

38:10.480 --> 38:11.902
Okay, but Dutch,

38:13.000 --> 38:16.777
no matter what dark shit
you ’ve been through,

38:16.880 --> 38:21.021
you can let in some light without
setting everything on ﬁre.

38:26.840 --> 38:28.228
This is Volford.

38:28.320 --> 38:31.380
Where the hells is the money
transfer, you Hullen bastards?

38:31.480 --> 38:32.947
JOHN: Late for curfew again?

38:39.800 --> 38:42.621
Tell me you sold out my family for
more than just money, Charlie.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.345
I told you.

38:45.440 --> 38:48.659
I have kids.
My brother has a kid!

38:48.760 --> 38:51.502
We could go, right now.

38:51.640 --> 38:52.823
What?

38:52.920 --> 38:54.979
You know,
like we always said we would.

38:55.080 --> 38:57.947
Grab a ship, any ship,
head out past the stars.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.587
Just you and me.

39:00.680 --> 39:02.022
What about your kids?

39:02.120 --> 39:04.338
They have grandparents.

39:05.080 --> 39:06.707
Besides,

39:06.800 --> 39:08.665
what do you
have holding you back?

39:20.720 --> 39:24.599
A heart,
like you used to.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.140
Yeah?

39:28.240 --> 39:30.879
How's that working out
for you?

39:44.120 --> 39:46.577
SO, how was homecoming?

39:46.680 --> 39:48.705
When we get back to
Westerly, I'll tell you.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.824
Guess what move I used
to get out of the cuffs.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.427
Spider twist?
Spider twist.

39:59.560 --> 40:01.300
Hey, mini-D'Av.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.982
You want to see the only cool
thing about being on this rock?

40:09.240 --> 40:10.264
(EXHALES)

40:11.840 --> 40:13.262
I used to lie on the dunes

40:13.360 --> 40:15.737
and wonder what it would be
like to escape to the stars.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.500
See that one?

40:18.600 --> 40:20.181
That's Quispan.

40:22.200 --> 40:23.747
And over there past
that mountain

40:23.840 --> 40:25.057
is the Unagin Belt.

40:25.160 --> 40:27.537
Why are the Hullen
hunting me?

40:33.200 --> 40:36.226
We know the Lady wants you.
We just don't know why.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.065
But we're gonna keep fighting
her until she stops.

40:39.160 --> 40:42.505
But you can't fight her if Dad's
always trying to protect me.

40:46.040 --> 40:48.383
Before she left,

40:49.200 --> 40:51.020
Delle Seyah gave me this

40:52.240 --> 40:54.026
in case I need to find her.

40:55.840 --> 40:58.104
I think I could be safe there

40:58.200 --> 40:59.781
with her.

41:01.680 --> 41:04.422
Do you think my dad
will understand?

41:04.920 --> 41:07.559
I think knowing you're safe
is all he ever wanted.

41:14.280 --> 41:15.907
It's the same bunker,

41:16.000 --> 41:17.900
same shitty furniture.

41:22.720 --> 41:24.540
I forgot how easy it is

41:26.280 --> 41:29.022
to fall back into the same

41:29.120 --> 41:30.144
toxic patterns.

41:30.240 --> 41:32.265
Is that why you left?

41:32.360 --> 41:33.827
'Cause you didn't think
I could break out Of mine?

41:33.960 --> 41:36.827
Dutch... You had every
right to be angry,

41:36.920 --> 41:39.024
to protect your son,
all of it.

41:40.240 --> 41:42.583
But...

41:42.760 --> 41:44.944
You left because

41:45.080 --> 41:47.423
you didn't believe
I could do better.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.900
And it hurts.

41:59.760 --> 42:01.660
_ I need to know
if you're giving up on us.

42:01.760 --> 42:02.863
No.

42:08.440 --> 42:10.180
Good.

42:10.280 --> 42:11.986
'Cause neither am |.

42:23.960 --> 42:27.418
You know, this is probably the most
adult conversation I have ever had.

42:27.520 --> 42:28.623
(BOTH LAUGHING)

42:28.720 --> 42:30.187
Same.

42:31.240 --> 42:32.559
(GASPING)

42:32.640 --> 42:34.107
What the hells?

42:34.880 --> 42:37.667
Ow! My back! D'Avin, D'Avin,
get it off, get it off!

42:37.760 --> 42:39.148
What's happening?

42:41.200 --> 42:42.588
It burns!
