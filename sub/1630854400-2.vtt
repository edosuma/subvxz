16:07.096 --> 16:08.532
Timed to the second.

16:08.576 --> 16:10.534
Or better yet, like a sausage
that's been stuffed

16:10.578 --> 16:12.710
full of pork
to the brink of explosion.

16:12.754 --> 16:15.670
We don't have extra time.
- I understand. I do.

16:15.713 --> 16:17.977
But the fans need to know

16:18.020 --> 16:19.891
why Rocky Maivia
is turning heel.

16:19.935 --> 16:21.328
Otherwise,
they're never gonna care.

16:21.371 --> 16:24.026
I just need a chance
to show them the real me.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.375
- I'm listening.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.160
- So if you gave me, like,
12 minutes

16:27.203 --> 16:29.292
to explain it to them--
- I'll give you 2.

16:29.336 --> 16:31.077
- I'll take it.
- Yeah.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.600
- But, you know,
2 1/2 would give me some time

16:32.643 --> 16:34.428
to work in some backstory...
2 is fine.

16:35.907 --> 16:36.038
.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.345
- Ultimately, that was a vote
of confidence from Vince.

16:38.388 --> 16:39.824
I mean, getting microphone time

16:39.868 --> 16:42.653
on a live broadcast of "Raw"
is precious.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.873
And he still believed
in Rocky Maivia enough

16:44.916 --> 16:47.571
to give it to me,
and I had to prove him right.

16:47.615 --> 16:50.357
I had one shot
to make the crowd give a damn.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.620
- So did you know
what you were gonna say?

16:52.663 --> 16:54.578
- I just wanted to be honest.

16:54.622 --> 16:56.493
- ♪ We are the Nation

17:11.117 --> 17:12.814
- Heel looks good on him.

17:12.857 --> 17:15.034

Your son's wife can see

17:31.137 --> 17:32.442
I want you to take a look
at this man right here.

17:32.486 --> 17:34.444

his promo,

17:34.488 --> 17:37.099
time slowed down for me
as I waited for my moment.

to be my honest,

at all those fans
who had given me hell

17:43.801 --> 17:47.066
over the past year,
it all became clear.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.720
- Tell 'em, Rocky.

17:49.764 --> 17:52.506
- I've got three words...

17:52.549 --> 17:56.945
die, Rocky, die.

17:56.988 --> 17:59.600
That's the gratitude I get
from you pieces of crap...

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:05.997 --> 18:08.609
This isn't
about the color of my skin.

18:08.652 --> 18:12.178
This is about respect.

18:12.221 --> 18:16.269
I became the youngest
intercontinental champion

18:16.312 --> 18:18.227
in WWF history.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.229
And what did it get me?

18:20.273 --> 18:22.362
In arenas across the country,

18:22.405 --> 18:24.799
I heard chants
of "Rocky sucks."

18:24.842 --> 18:26.496
[crowd chanting "Rocky sucks"]

18:26.540 --> 18:29.456
Well, Rocky Maivia's
a lot of things,

18:29.499 --> 18:32.154
but sucks isn't one of them.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.810
And I want to make
one thing clear

18:35.853 --> 18:38.247
to all you jackass fans

18:57.745 --> 19:00.574
- At that moment,
I felt incredible.

19:00.617 --> 19:02.141
I mean, finally getting
a chance

19:02.184 --> 19:04.621
to express myself,
my true self--

19:04.665 --> 19:06.188
- Kind of like when I played
Kim Jong Un,

19:06.232 --> 19:08.451
except no one saw it.
- I saw it.

19:08.495 --> 19:09.800
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You were great.

19:09.844 --> 19:11.280
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

19:11.324 --> 19:12.847
But, you know, at that time,

19:12.890 --> 19:14.022
I didn't know whether or not

19:14.065 --> 19:15.850
my promo registered
with the fans

19:15.893 --> 19:17.591
or even the WWE executives.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.854
You've gotta remember
it was 1997.

19:19.897 --> 19:21.899
So there was no hopping
on social media

19:21.943 --> 19:23.249
to get instant reactions.

19:23.292 --> 19:25.686
- Oh, that sounds amazing.
- If only.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.688

some read on how it went.

- Interesting stuff there,
Rock.

19:33.259 --> 19:34.521
- Yeah, what'd you think?

19:34.564 --> 19:35.739
They were riled up, right?

19:35.783 --> 19:37.132
I mean, at least some of them.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.960
- Uh, I mean you rattled
a few cages,

19:39.003 --> 19:40.353
but it could be cheap heat.

19:40.396 --> 19:41.658
You called them pieces of crap.

19:41.702 --> 19:42.920
- [chuckles] Yeah.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.357
That was fun. I did enjoy that.

you were more interesting

19:46.359 --> 19:47.490
in the last two minutes

19:47.534 --> 19:48.535
than you've been
in the last six months.

19:48.578 --> 19:49.884
- Wow, okay.

19:49.927 --> 19:52.060
Everybody just out the gate
with the honesty.

19:52.103 --> 19:54.236

necessarily good.

You know? My cat throws up
a human thumb.

19:56.282 --> 19:59.198
Is it interesting? Sure.
But is it good? No.

- Hey, stay focused.

is what the folks at home think

20:18.739 --> 20:20.393
- [clears throat]

20:20.436 --> 20:23.700
- Well, I casually walked
by Vince four times that night

20:23.744 --> 20:25.659
and got nothing.

20:25.702 --> 20:27.922
I didn't know how any of it
was gonna shake out.

20:27.965 --> 20:29.967
But either way,
I'm glad I did it.

20:30.011 --> 20:33.754
It allowed me the opportunity
to be my true, authentic self,

20:33.797 --> 20:35.277
to control my narrative.

20:35.321 --> 20:39.586
And that, Mr. President,
is exactly what you need to do.

20:39.629 --> 20:42.284
- You're right.

20:42.328 --> 20:43.677
Thank you for your insight,
Dwayne.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.766
You are a gifted storyteller.

20:45.809 --> 20:47.289
- Isn't he?

20:47.333 --> 20:48.943

to bring some of that magic

20:48.986 --> 20:51.250
to Gjelgjiughm and solve
this coffee crisis for us.

20:51.293 --> 20:55.210
Turns out Prime Minister Honig
is a huge Rock fan.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.299
She uses your catchphrases
in her speeches.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.780
She knows
all of your matches in detail,

20:59.823 --> 21:01.477
and I think, with
the exception of "Huskies,"

21:01.521 --> 21:02.957
has seen all of your movies.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.524
- Is she not an animation fan
or something?

21:04.567 --> 21:06.090
Because "Huskies" was good.

21:06.134 --> 21:07.440
- We need you to fly
to Gjelgjiughm

21:07.483 --> 21:09.964
and convince her to take
this coffee trade deal.

21:10.007 --> 21:13.184
America needs you,
Dwayne Johnson.

21:13.228 --> 21:15.665
You are the only man
for this job.

21:15.709 --> 21:20.757
Will you go on a coffee run
for America?

21:20.801 --> 21:23.978
- I'm honored, Mr. President.
Thank you.

21:24.021 --> 21:27.198

that last bit.
