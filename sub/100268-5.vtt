Look at you, out there in nature.
Is that a lake? Oh, that's so fun!

00:31.239 --> 00:33.783
Don't anger the bees.
Got your Epinephrine?

00:33.867 --> 00:35.869
I'm not allergic to bees, Mom!

00:35.952 --> 00:40.331
So you say. Wait until you get attacked
and blow up into a giant blueberry.

00:40.415 --> 00:43.626
How's your science?
Is our little baby making friends?

00:43.710 --> 00:46.588
I'm not a baby! Can a baby build this?

00:47.714 --> 00:51.551
Wanda, look! It's like those wings he made
when he was a baby.

00:51.801 --> 00:53.678
Oh yeah! That was pretty cool.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.764
But this is better!

00:55.847 --> 00:58.725
It's a drone suit! Watch!

00:59.476 --> 01:02.353
I'm flying! Woo-hoo!

01:02.437 --> 01:06.941
Frostee, that's amazing!
Look Wanda, our little angel is flying.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.943
Don't you bring that thing home.

01:09.027 --> 01:13.114
I just got the laser nonsense fixed.
I don't need a hole in the roof.

-Mm-hm.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.379

going to get us rich or kill us all.

01:51.778 --> 01:56.241
Look dude, I'm just saying, you can't
use your car to stop a speeding train,

01:56.491 --> 01:58.576
then complain when it has problems.

01:58.660 --> 02:01.287
If I didn't stop it,
we'd have more problems.

That thing is called "the engine".

02:16.970 --> 02:19.139
Ahh... Thanks.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.224
I'll hold, you tighten.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.477
I didn't realize you got your hands dirty.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.230
My nails have enough dirt
to plant potatoes.

02:27.313 --> 02:31.317
You're the one with baby hands. So soft.
What moisturizer do you use?

02:31.401 --> 02:35.238
What? These mitts are like leather on iron
covered in barbed wire.

02:35.321 --> 02:39.284
Please. You can't hold a cup of tea

-[chuckles] Shut up.
-Uh, you here for any reason?

02:45.582 --> 02:49.377
To tell y'all about the next event.
We're going up Mount Zebulon.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.838
-What's that?
-It's Shashi's dream rally.

02:51.921 --> 02:54.090
He's always talking about it.

02:54.173 --> 02:57.093
The whole mound is owned by
some tech billionaire.

02:57.176 --> 02:59.554
The codes we stole unlock the security.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.347
Is it a diamond mine or...?

03:01.431 --> 03:04.851
-Is it hollowed out like a giant vault?
-Is it a volcano?

03:05.351 --> 03:07.645
Why would Shashi want to rob a volcano?

03:07.854 --> 03:10.899
To get the pumice.
To corner the soap market.

03:10.982 --> 03:15.695
Shashi loves cars, and nothing gets grease
out from under your nails like pumice.

03:15.904 --> 03:20.575
Step back! I'm going to slam the hood
on Cisco's head to get it working again.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.911
We're not stealing this time.

03:22.994 --> 03:26.164
It just makes him mad
that one guy can own a mountain.

03:26.247 --> 03:29.125
He wants it to be
the biggest SH1FT3R rally ever.

03:29.334 --> 03:32.629
We'd better adjust your fuel mix
so it runs at altitude.

03:32.712 --> 03:35.840
Get your cars ready too.
Shashi wants everyone racing.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.551
[both gasp] Yeah!

03:38.635 --> 03:42.055
I put in wide stance wheels
for stabilization and turns.

03:42.138 --> 03:44.641
[slurps] I put in mega-cupholders.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.392
Booster rockets for thrust.

03:46.851 --> 03:48.728
Hot  and  cold cupholders!

03:48.811 --> 03:52.774
Top secret experimental government battery
and a sick new paint job.

03:52.857 --> 03:54.692
I mounted on this sweet rocket,

03:54.776 --> 03:58.321
and in case I have to work on it,
undercarriage cupholders!

03:58.404 --> 04:01.366
With all those cupholders,
you'll need a bathroom.

04:01.449 --> 04:04.285
Who needs a bathroom
with all these empty cups?

04:04.369 --> 04:05.286
[Echo] Ew!

04:08.790 --> 04:10.708
I don't care what Layla said.

04:10.792 --> 04:14.462
Breaking into a mountain lair
owned by a reclusive billionaire?

04:14.545 --> 04:16.297
Shashi is stealing something.

04:16.547 --> 04:19.550
I don't think you get it.
Layla and Shashi trust me.

04:19.634 --> 04:23.763
I'm on the inside, deep cover.
They've no idea I'm a spy. I'm good.

04:24.222 --> 04:27.725
-I've pulled off everything he's given me.
-One mission.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.519
Yeah. Every mission.

04:29.602 --> 04:33.231
If it were a heist, I'd know.
Layla's like my best friend now.

[exhales] Don't scare me like that, bro.

04:40.947 --> 04:44.075
Gary, pull up a holographic map
of Mount Zebulon.

04:45.368 --> 04:46.286
[Frostee] Hm.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.833
-Where are you going?
-Just to get coffee.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.502
You want coffee, you can roll over to it.

04:56.796 --> 04:59.757
-What are you doing, Julius?
-I need the bathroom.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.135
Roll, baby. Roll on.

05:03.303 --> 05:07.890
Think they can outstep me in the fitness
challenge? They're sadly mistaken.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.852
See the satellite dishes
on the mountaintop.

05:10.935 --> 05:13.604
Up there,
Shashi can hack air traffic control,

05:13.688 --> 05:16.649
shut down communication
throughout North America...

05:16.733 --> 05:19.193
Who knows? Maybe the keys are satellites.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.404
Are there satellites in his vault?

05:21.487 --> 05:22.822
[scoffs] Nah, man.

05:22.905 --> 05:27.410
But there was a lot of cool stolen stuff.
Oh, and some awesome custom cars.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.203
Yeah, those rides were dope.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.581
Check it out, T. I took some pictures.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.459
-Sweet! What kind of car is that?
-I don't know.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.503
I looked, but couldn't find
where they were made.

05:37.587 --> 05:41.132
[Frostee] They have weird frames
of an experimental alloy,

05:41.215 --> 05:42.675
a magnetic signature--

05:42.759 --> 05:46.220
Forget the cars!
It's always about cars with you people.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.723
We're looking for keys.

05:49.223 --> 05:52.727
We didn't find any keys,
secret drives, codes, or nothing.

05:52.810 --> 05:56.647
But Frostee and I researched Delwyn Usk,
who owns the mountain.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.859
He has a connection
to the other dudes Shashi robbed.

05:59.942 --> 06:00.818
Yeah.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.696
Check out this picture from 1993.

If you're waiting for me to be
embarrassed, keep waiting. I look  good.

06:14.332 --> 06:18.044
[laughs] Okay, I'm just playing.
[chuckles]

06:18.127 --> 06:22.715
Okay, so there's Usk, who obviously built
all the cool rockets and space stuff;

06:22.799 --> 06:25.468
the software founder
who had the bullet train;

06:25.551 --> 06:27.804
Williams, whose yacht got robbed.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.014
I don't know who these guys are.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.266
So they're all connected...

06:32.558 --> 06:35.645
Of course.
All rich people know each other, right?

06:35.728 --> 06:38.231
That's right.
Ever heard of the Illuminati?

06:38.314 --> 06:41.192
You should be looking out
for the Bilderbergers.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.402
Yeah! The wizard people!

06:43.486 --> 06:45.363
-How do you---
-Shut up, Julius.

06:45.863 --> 06:48.908
Can we focus on
the actual conspiracy please?

06:49.492 --> 06:51.285
This mountain is a target.

06:51.702 --> 06:54.997
[Ms. Nowhere]  Delwyn Usk must have
a key here somewhere.

06:55.081 --> 06:59.252
I'll stick by Shashi, but if he were
stealing something, I'd know.

06:59.335 --> 07:02.046
I mean, these guys saw
Layla opening up to me.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.965
Yeah. Kinda made me sick.

07:04.298 --> 07:06.384
Don't fall for the honeypot, T.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.344
See me using my spy talk?

07:08.594 --> 07:10.012
I'm not falling for her.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.557
We're just friends. Colleagues.

07:12.640 --> 07:16.269
You're neither.
She's a criminal you're investigating.

07:16.352 --> 07:20.106
Get your head straight.
You've been a spy for about two minutes.

07:20.189 --> 07:22.692
Don't be threatened
by the next generation.

07:22.775 --> 07:27.029
Whoo. It is a long way up this thing.
Glad I enlarged my cupholders.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.031
I'm taking a bucket-sized Yoka.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.283
You're not going.

07:30.366 --> 07:33.578
You'll stay in the hauler
and monitor those satellites.

07:33.661 --> 07:38.541
Besides, I'm not throwing a 13-year-old
into a mess with no operational security.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.751
-Let the kid come along.
-Kid?!

07:40.835 --> 07:44.005
I got this locked down
tighter than Gary's glutes.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.090
Oh! Thank you, Tony.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.884
He's staying in the hauler.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.512
Oh, man! Science camp is boring.

08:06.277 --> 08:07.320
[Shashi] Tony!

08:09.947 --> 08:13.075
-Hey, man.
-You all ready to tame that beast?

08:13.326 --> 08:16.245
-You know it.
-I put in so many cupholders.

08:17.663 --> 08:18.498
Cool...

08:19.665 --> 08:24.921
I've dreamt of this for years. My parents
and I would camp here before they passed.

08:25.213 --> 08:28.841
Then this rich jerk bought the whole thing
and fenced it off.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.510
-That's messed up.
-Right?

08:30.760 --> 08:34.805
How can one man own a whole mountain
and keep everyone off of it?

08:34.889 --> 08:37.767
In America, land of the free!

08:37.850 --> 08:40.019
[crowd cheers]

08:40.353 --> 08:43.439
Today, we're gonna roll
right through the front gate.

08:43.523 --> 08:47.109
Today, we're taking Mount Zebulon
back for the people.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.402
Let's roll!

08:50.363 --> 08:53.241
Stick close.
We'll lead the way up together.

Excuse me! Can you guys help me?
I'm looking for Mount Zebulon.

09:10.174 --> 09:13.719
I'm sorry, sir, this is private property.
You can't be here.

09:13.803 --> 09:18.599
Yeah. I'm just trying to get to this old
campsite I used to visit with my parents.

09:18.683 --> 09:22.103
You see, they passed away,
and it's a special place for me.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.772
Sir, I have to ask you to move along.

09:24.855 --> 09:28.150
Mount Zebulon is private property,
there's no admittance.

09:28.234 --> 09:31.153
-The whole mountain is private property?
-Yes sir.

09:31.487 --> 09:32.822
You think that's okay?

09:35.032 --> 09:36.993
If you don't leave immediately,

09:37.076 --> 09:40.580
we are authorized to remove you
by any means necessary.

09:41.455 --> 09:42.331
Wait a second.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.668
Do the citizens of this country
even get a vote anymore?

09:45.751 --> 09:49.005
Or is the whole system
run by billionaires like Usk?

09:49.297 --> 09:53.217
You have ten seconds before we open fire.
Please leave.

09:53.634 --> 09:57.805
Look at you, surrounded by technology
you think makes you strong.

09:57.888 --> 10:01.434
But your dependence on it
is actually your greatest weakness.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.102

Man, I want to race up a mountain.

10:33.799 --> 10:37.928
I don't like this. Shashi is
drawing attention. Something isn't right.

-[Layla] Woo-hoo!
-Didn't I say this place was awesome?

10:50.399 --> 10:53.861
It's incredible! I hope you don't mind
if I take the lead?

10:55.946 --> 10:58.991
Not at all.
But get ready for a few surprises.

-Yeah, son! [laughs]

11:08.042 --> 11:08.876
Hooray...

11:10.461 --> 11:13.547
Although we hacked
Delwyn Usk's security to get in,

11:13.631 --> 11:16.258
there are already
federal agents on our tail.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.261
You see, Tony Toretto and his crew...

11:20.137 --> 11:21.889
are working for the feds.

Mr. "Deep Cover."

11:29.397 --> 11:32.066
Huh. Maybe espionage isn't my thing.

11:32.691 --> 11:33.526
No way.

11:33.609 --> 11:36.654
I know. Hard to believe
a Toretto would turn rat.

11:36.987 --> 11:39.073
That's what the world is coming to.

11:39.448 --> 11:44.036
His crew broke into my house, went through
my stuff, and even ate my froyo!

11:44.120 --> 11:45.579
That was my bad.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.748
Some would say this is bad news,

and turn them into lemonade.

Yes. Get back down, we'll take it
