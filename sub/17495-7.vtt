WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.307 --> 00:09.309
'The Geordie squad are back.'

00:09.376 --> 00:11.644
This time, it's gonna be massive.

00:11.711 --> 00:13.246
Fuck off, Newcastle.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.883
We're gonna mission
around the party islands.

00:18.151 --> 00:22.255
(screaming)

00:22.322 --> 00:24.591
Things are about to get
Lionel Messi.

00:26.626 --> 00:29.095
There's gonna be pool parties.

00:29.162 --> 00:30.797
Boat parties.

00:31.731 --> 00:33.266
Paint parties.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.668
The biggest parties
of our fucking lives.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.071
More necking on.

00:39.806 --> 00:42.008
Oh, shit.

00:42.075 --> 00:44.611
There's gonna be
shit loads of bucking.

00:46.613 --> 00:49.182
Belly flop! Belly flop!

00:49.249 --> 00:50.784
Let's fucking do this.

00:53.119 --> 00:55.855
There's gonna be carnage.
Fucking little slag!

00:59.893 --> 01:01.928
Kick-offs.
(shouting)

01:01.995 --> 01:03.630
Marnie, Marnie!

01:05.665 --> 01:07.267
Drama.

01:10.036 --> 01:11.638
Oh, my God!
(siren)

01:11.704 --> 01:14.073
Let's get fucking mortal.

01:15.375 --> 01:18.445
This is the ultimate
party island crawl.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.783
(farts) Welcome to the girls' room,
you little radge packet!

01:25.151 --> 01:28.521
Me, Charlotte and Gary
used to call ourselves the Tripod.

01:28.588 --> 01:31.224
It upsets us
that we'll never be the same.

01:36.196 --> 01:39.632
Sophie's dropped the bombshell
that Charlotte's not over us.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.939
Me and Aaron have made up
and we're back together.

01:46.005 --> 01:47.640
And it's amazing.

01:47.707 --> 01:52.812
I'm gonna get in bed with Marty. If
his cock slips in my vagina, result!

01:53.913 --> 01:55.682
This is typical me and Marty.

01:55.748 --> 01:58.318
One minute we're arguing,
the next we're in bed.

01:58.384 --> 02:00.753
If this isn't true love,
I don't know what is.

02:03.590 --> 02:06.326
Ayia! Ayia! Ayia fucking Napa!

02:06.392 --> 02:08.394
(all chant) Napa! Napa! Napa!

02:09.596 --> 02:11.631
Fucking hell. That hurt.

02:14.634 --> 02:17.203
I dislocated my knee,
but it went back in,

02:17.270 --> 02:19.606
so there's no long-lasting damage.

02:19.672 --> 02:22.208
I am a fucking good nurse.

02:23.309 --> 02:26.379
I haven't come to Napa
to play happy families with Chloe.

02:26.446 --> 02:28.181
I've came here to pull birds.

02:28.248 --> 02:32.185
Marty is not right in the head.
Yesterday, he had sex with us

02:32.252 --> 02:34.921
and now he's gone on the pull.
What the fuck?

02:38.291 --> 02:42.028
Us two together
have ruined everyone's nights.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.898
I'm gonna be honest,
I'm getting sick of it.

02:44.964 --> 02:47.400
I said everything
would be fine with Chloe,

02:47.467 --> 02:50.270
but now I'm starting to think
maybe it won't.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.007
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:54.073 --> 02:56.309
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

02:56.376 --> 02:59.178
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

02:59.245 --> 03:01.481
I'm gonna tear the place up.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.850
I'm radge and I wrap lads
around my finger.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.885
I'm preened to perfection.

03:05.952 --> 03:07.820
I'm totally crackers me, like.

03:07.887 --> 03:10.056
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

03:10.123 --> 03:12.325
Me banter's pure naughty.

03:12.392 --> 03:14.460
I'm fake, flirty,
I've got double Fs.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.529
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

03:27.574 --> 03:29.609
Our first night out in Napa was shit.

03:29.676 --> 03:32.345
Marty went fucking mental.
Chloe went AWOL.

03:32.412 --> 03:34.480
Aaron and Marnie weren't even there.

03:34.547 --> 03:37.116
And I woke up alone. What happened?

03:37.183 --> 03:40.286
What you doing there?
It's the coolest room in the house.

03:40.353 --> 03:42.288
Last night, I needed to cool down.

03:42.355 --> 03:44.824
And the coolest place
is the pool table.

03:47.293 --> 03:51.130
I love to prank, and top of
my prank hit list is Nathan.

03:51.197 --> 03:55.034
When I see him asleep on the sofa,
I'm not wasting this opportunity.

03:56.035 --> 03:59.505
(laughs) YOLO, bitches.
Fuck you doing, you idiot?

03:59.572 --> 04:02.408
(laughter)

04:05.912 --> 04:08.948
Morning. Well, last night was shit,
wasn't it?

04:09.015 --> 04:10.617
I'm so pissed off with Marty.

04:10.683 --> 04:14.921
I can't believe he went on the pull
after we had sex the day before.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.423
I kicked off cos I like him so much.

04:17.490 --> 04:21.293
It's hard, Chloe, cos I know
you like him and everything.

04:21.361 --> 04:23.062
But you still end up in his bed,

04:23.129 --> 04:26.499
which sometimes you just gotta
fight that temptation.

04:26.566 --> 04:28.534
It's easier said than done, but...

04:28.601 --> 04:31.804
We've all been through this.
It's not like you're the first.

04:31.871 --> 04:34.407
We know. We're trying
to tell you what we know.

04:34.474 --> 04:36.876
It's just hard
cos I like him so much.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.978
I do feel for Chloe.

04:39.045 --> 04:41.581
All of us girls have been
pied by lads in the past

04:41.648 --> 04:43.483
and it's one of those life lessons.

04:43.549 --> 04:45.485
It's honestly so disgusting

04:45.551 --> 04:48.454
how he can shag a different girl
every fucking night

04:48.521 --> 04:51.524
and then come back to me.
It's so disgusting.

04:51.591 --> 04:54.594
I don't want to talk about it
any more cos it winds us up.

04:55.762 --> 04:58.231
I'm sick about
talking about fuck face.

04:59.465 --> 05:00.466
(cries)

05:06.272 --> 05:09.976
It wasn't that good after you were
trying to bend it around my head.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.345
Me and Aaron
had the most amazing night.

05:12.412 --> 05:15.148
I took care of him.
I nursed him back to health.

05:15.214 --> 05:16.482
I'm a good girlfriend.

05:16.549 --> 05:18.985
I even got on top
and I did all of the work.

05:19.052 --> 05:22.789
Marnie looked after us last night.
I could get used to this.

05:22.855 --> 05:25.658
Maybe my knee might take
a little bit longer to heal.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.794
(both laugh)

05:29.529 --> 05:31.264
(both laugh)

05:34.967 --> 05:36.536
(indistinct) Ah.

05:36.602 --> 05:38.204
Oh, no!
Oh!

05:38.271 --> 05:41.174
I'm smashing Gaz at table football,

05:41.240 --> 05:43.943
but mind you,
he's like an old man compared to me.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.946
Speaking of old men, morning, Aaron.
You all right?

05:47.013 --> 05:49.482
How was your night?
Did you cruise missile her?

05:49.549 --> 05:51.651
Fucking good.
What was yours like?

05:51.718 --> 05:53.252
Whole night was a nightmare.

05:53.319 --> 05:56.122
I'm gonna have a word with her.
I'm gonna say,

05:56.189 --> 05:59.492
"It doesn't matter what I do.
You're gonna kick off anyway."

05:59.559 --> 06:02.361
It's a lot easier
when you actually didn't speak.

06:02.428 --> 06:04.797
The only answer is Marty and Chloe

06:04.864 --> 06:07.533
just stay out of each other's way
for a few days,

06:07.600 --> 06:10.837
until the group actually
has some good fucking nights out.

06:10.903 --> 06:13.239
Every day and night
is getting ruined.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.046
(phone rings)

06:20.113 --> 06:24.183
So the phone's ringing
and it can only be one person, Anna.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.519
Hello, the mental house.

06:32.191 --> 06:34.927
Right, see you back in Newcastle.
Bye.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.699
Fuck's sake. Anna said that
I've gotta go back to Newcastle.

06:39.766 --> 06:41.334
I'm not ready to go home.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.536
What'd she day?
So...

06:44.904 --> 06:47.907
Tonight is my last night.
I gotta go back to Newcastle.

06:47.974 --> 06:49.408
(sniffles)
Holly, sorry.

06:49.475 --> 06:52.044
Not only did we have
a shit night last night,

06:52.111 --> 06:53.946
but Sophie's gotta leave as well.

06:54.013 --> 06:56.482
Could this day
actually get any worse?

06:56.549 --> 07:01.187
For me, please, please, please,
let's just get the gang together.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.789
I'm not ready to say goodbye.

07:02.855 --> 07:07.460
Despite all the shit that's went on,
I am gonna miss this place.

07:07.527 --> 07:09.562
It kills us
to have to leave everyone.

07:09.629 --> 07:10.963
It's your last day.

07:11.030 --> 07:13.232
Make it fucking amazing.
We will, man.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.772
We're gutted it's Sophie's last day,

07:19.839 --> 07:22.608
but I'm determined
to send her out with a bang.

07:22.675 --> 07:26.813
And I know just the thing.
Beach party!

07:31.651 --> 07:34.253
Yous, I'm gutted
this is my last day and night.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.557
My mam's fucking off. Who am I
gonna go to when I'm crying?

07:42.962 --> 07:46.265
We get to the beach party
and it's fucking wicked.

07:46.332 --> 07:49.669
The crowd are wicked. We're wicked.

07:49.735 --> 07:52.104
This is gonna be wicked.

07:59.679 --> 08:00.913
Right, come on.

08:03.449 --> 08:05.418
I need to find out
who is on the pull.

08:05.484 --> 08:09.155
I hope the lads aren't up for it
cos I've had a change of heart.

08:14.594 --> 08:17.697
I realised that
I actually miss Charlotte

08:17.763 --> 08:19.765
a lot more than I thought I did.

08:26.105 --> 08:29.842
I know Chloe better than anyone
and she fucking adores Marty,

08:29.909 --> 08:32.611
but she needs to get over him
cos he's not into her

08:32.678 --> 08:34.947
and everyone is sick of the shit.

08:41.187 --> 08:44.357
I do hear Nathan. I don't wanna
ruin everyone's holiday.

08:44.423 --> 08:47.727
I know everyone's getting sick
of it. I need to change my ways.

08:55.801 --> 08:58.104
I promised Nathan
that I won't kick off.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.644
Which is so hard because once I see
Marty pull, it kills us inside.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.513
I need to keep my feelings to myself
and stay strong.

09:15.087 --> 09:18.090
What the fuck is going on
on that stage?

09:18.157 --> 09:21.527
It looks pure mint.
Marnie, let wuh gan.

09:28.267 --> 09:30.002
All this girl-on-girl dancing.

09:30.069 --> 09:32.805
This is an amazing start
to my last night in Napa.

09:34.707 --> 09:38.945
Me and Chloe just smashed it. I hope
Aaron sees the funny side in it.

09:39.011 --> 09:40.479
It was an innocent dance.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.824
It's Sophie's last night.

09:51.891 --> 09:54.827
This beach party
has been incredible.

09:54.894 --> 09:57.930
We've all got drunk, had a laugh.
It's time to head back.

10:01.233 --> 10:04.770
So far, so good. I haven't pulled
and I've ignored Chloe,

10:04.837 --> 10:08.074
so she hasn't kicked off.
I'm gonna keep it that way.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.014
Marty's having cramps.
We send him to hospital.

10:15.081 --> 10:18.384
I felt like there was a fucking
alien trying to burst out.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.486
I'm gutted to be going home.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.855
I'm just glad everyone's on a high.

10:22.922 --> 10:25.691
Aaron, what the fuck is that?

10:25.758 --> 10:27.493
It's a tiny little scratch.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.363
I've got a plan that will help her
get over Marty.

10:30.429 --> 10:32.365
I'm gonna shave my hair off.

10:32.431 --> 10:34.767
(all) Geordie Shore! Why-aye!

10:37.003 --> 10:37.203
.

10:39.705 --> 10:39.939
.

10:40.006 --> 10:43.909
'Alreet? The very bad language and
sexual scenes continue throughout.'

10:43.976 --> 10:47.680
'If you're easily offended,
you know what to do. Stop watching.'

10:53.252 --> 10:57.089
We're back at the villa to get ready
for the second half of our night.

10:57.156 --> 11:00.626
We've been a family. We've had
a laugh, so to my last night.

11:00.693 --> 11:02.361
Let's all stick together.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.530
Fucking right.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.665
We are all loving
Sophie's last night.

11:06.732 --> 11:09.035
Get us to that club
and we're gonna go mad.

11:23.649 --> 11:26.719
I get this radge pain in my belly
on the way to the club,

11:26.786 --> 11:29.789
so we turn round and head for home
and it gets no better.

11:33.192 --> 11:36.529
Marty's having bad cramps,
so we have to send him to hospital.

11:36.595 --> 11:38.264
See you when you get back.

11:38.330 --> 11:42.001
That's another man down. It's like
a fucking sick note, this place.

11:42.068 --> 11:46.405
Marty's fucked off to hospital,
so we're gonna party at the villa.

11:46.472 --> 11:48.140
Oh!
Hey!

11:48.207 --> 11:50.943
So, Marty may be down,
but we're certainly not out.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.579
It's after-party time
and the vibe's great.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.414
Let's raise a burger to Marty.

11:55.481 --> 11:57.650
There's one way
to get this party started

11:57.716 --> 12:01.320
and that is with the ultimate Slip
'N slide and we are raring to go.

12:03.789 --> 12:04.790
Go!

12:05.825 --> 12:07.827
What the fuck? I'm shit at this.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.029
It's cos Gaz has stolen
my best Speedos.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.597
Oh!

12:12.598 --> 12:14.800
# Slip, slide, slip and slide

12:14.867 --> 12:16.669
# Are you gonna get inside? #

12:16.735 --> 12:18.337
Ah!

12:18.404 --> 12:22.007
(they laugh)
What the hell's she doing?

12:22.074 --> 12:24.810
You'd think them double Fs
would help her bounce.

12:24.877 --> 12:26.278
Go on, Marn!

12:26.345 --> 12:27.646
(they laugh)

12:30.116 --> 12:33.219
Shit. I forget it's concrete
under the sheet

12:33.285 --> 12:35.054
and I've bruised my fanny.

12:36.155 --> 12:38.757
Aaron, may have to
look after yourself tonight.

12:38.824 --> 12:40.559
Go on, son!

12:40.626 --> 12:42.528
Go on in! Go!

12:49.969 --> 12:52.338
(laughter)

12:52.404 --> 12:54.140
We are all having so much fun

12:54.206 --> 12:57.143
and it's times like this
that I love this family.

12:57.209 --> 13:01.213
I'm gutted Sophie's going tomorrow.
We're gonna miss her so much.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.582
Whenever I'm feeling down
about anything,

13:03.649 --> 13:06.318
I turn to you and you
make us laugh and cheer us up.

13:06.385 --> 13:08.787
Thank you. Aww.

13:08.854 --> 13:11.624
Right... (cries)

13:11.690 --> 13:14.660
I feel like it's me wedding...
(laughter)

13:14.727 --> 13:18.130
Honestly, I've literally
not cried this whole time.

13:18.197 --> 13:21.333
It's the end of the night
and we're all talking about Sophie

13:21.400 --> 13:24.537
and it's starting to sink in
how much I'm gonna miss her.

13:24.603 --> 13:26.605
When you came back,

13:26.672 --> 13:30.309
I felt like my sister who'd been
here since day one was with us.

13:30.376 --> 13:32.077
Thank you.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.580
I'm just so happy.
I wish you were staying.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.681
I know. I know.

13:35.748 --> 13:38.884
Erm, right, for me...
Gaz, say it.

13:38.951 --> 13:41.187
Me and Gary have been through a lot,

13:41.253 --> 13:43.923
but he fucked up big time
with my friend Charlotte.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.458
Let's hope he's about to say
the right thing.

13:46.525 --> 13:49.528
I'm devastated cos I am starting
to miss Charlotte

13:49.595 --> 13:51.564
and I am getting a bit...
(groans)

13:51.630 --> 13:56.202
One person that understands what
I've been through with her is you.

13:56.268 --> 13:59.805
And if you go back and you see her,
you know what to tell her.

13:59.872 --> 14:01.974
And I've got this.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.643
Having Sophie here
reminds me of Charlotte

14:04.710 --> 14:06.779
and I'm starting to think,

14:06.845 --> 14:10.649
what is more important? Pulling
or rescuing things with Charlotte?

14:10.716 --> 14:14.286
I'm not gonna lie. When I first
came in here, I thought,

14:14.353 --> 14:16.488
the person I dread to see is Gary.

14:16.555 --> 14:20.125
Now I know we've sorted it out
and I genuinely hope

14:20.192 --> 14:24.463
you and Charlotte will sort it out,
but for now, I'm glad I've came in.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.765
I've said my bit
from her view and mine.

14:26.832 --> 14:30.970
Gary wants me to tell Charlotte that
he wants to make amends with her

14:31.036 --> 14:33.606
and I would love it to happen,
but who knows?

14:33.672 --> 14:35.407
Even though he is a dickhead,

14:35.474 --> 14:37.843
deep down,
I think he might have a heart.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.545
Sophie, I love you.

14:39.612 --> 14:43.015
I love you more than...
Chicken nuggets?

14:43.082 --> 14:44.383
I wouldn't go that far.

14:44.450 --> 14:46.585
Chicken nuggets or me?

14:46.652 --> 14:48.487
Chicken nuggets.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.956
I'm gonna miss Sophie so much,

14:51.023 --> 14:53.993
but, babe, you or chicken nuggets?
No contest.

14:56.295 --> 14:58.464
This has been
the perfect last night.

14:58.530 --> 15:01.333
We've had so much fun.
I'm gutted she's gotta leave.

15:21.787 --> 15:23.489
What is happening to everyone?

15:23.555 --> 15:25.858
I feel like something's
gonna happen to me.

15:25.924 --> 15:27.626
Lads are dropping like flies.

15:27.693 --> 15:30.162
First Scott, then Aaron.
Marty's in hospital.

15:30.229 --> 15:31.463
Shit. Who's next?

15:31.530 --> 15:34.533
You're the last man standing.
Last man standing.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.803
Last night, Marty ended up
in hospital with a bad stomach.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.439
Either that or he wanted
a break from Chloe.

15:40.506 --> 15:43.042
He best get his arse
back to this villa soon.

15:43.108 --> 15:46.845
I was laughing at Slip 'N Slide.
I had Nathan's fucking Speedos on.

15:46.912 --> 15:48.947
Don't you ever buy a pair of them.

15:53.952 --> 15:55.321
Good morning.

15:55.387 --> 15:57.556
Ugh, who's farted?

15:57.623 --> 15:58.757
Me.

15:58.824 --> 16:02.561
I've woken up and I feel like shit
and if that's not bad enough,

16:02.628 --> 16:04.797
it smells like Sophie's done a shit.

16:04.863 --> 16:06.732
D-Day. It's the day you leave.

16:06.799 --> 16:10.302
I know. I've gotta pack.
Your presence will be missed.

16:10.369 --> 16:13.305
Yous, it's getting a bit morbid now.

16:13.372 --> 16:16.542
I'm only going to Newcastle.
It's a two-hour flight.

16:16.608 --> 16:18.844
I've loved living in a house
with Sophie.

16:18.911 --> 16:22.247
I've got really close to her
and it's like she's my big sister.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.849
I'm gutted she's leaving.

16:23.916 --> 16:27.653
Me and Marty still haven't spoke,
like. I hope he's OK.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.688
Marty's unwell. I do miss him.

16:29.755 --> 16:32.825
I hope he gets better
and comes home so I can speak to him.

16:32.891 --> 16:34.827
At least yous didn't kick off.

16:34.893 --> 16:38.130
I wouldn't dare kick off
on your last night, Sophie.

16:43.836 --> 16:47.706
Last night I felt like there was an
alien trying to burst out my belly.

16:47.773 --> 16:51.210
I feel all right now. I just hope
I get back to say bye to Sophie.

16:55.447 --> 16:56.849
Boys, I'm going.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.619
Didn't really have that much, did I?

17:00.686 --> 17:02.588
I'm gutted about going home.

17:02.654 --> 17:05.124
I'm glad I'm leaving
when everyone's on a high.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.559
I hope when I've gone,
there's no kick-offs

17:07.626 --> 17:09.494
and they carry on the way they are.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.931
I love you so much. Thank you.
I've had such a good time.

17:12.998 --> 17:15.501
I'm gonna go
cos I don't want a big speech again.

17:15.567 --> 17:16.734
Get in the middle.

17:16.801 --> 17:19.972
We're all gonna see Sophie
when we go home,

17:20.038 --> 17:22.307
but it won't be the same
without her here.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.375
We love you.

17:24.643 --> 17:26.744
See yous later. Be good.

17:31.016 --> 17:33.519
Having Sophie back has been amazing

17:33.585 --> 17:36.288
and now that she's going,
I'm fucking gutted.

17:36.355 --> 17:38.424
Our numbers are just dropping.

17:38.490 --> 17:40.826
Everyone's got a face
like a smacked arse.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.829
I've got an idea
that will cheer everybody up.

17:43.896 --> 17:47.966
Get ready. Get some swim shorts on
and get to a fucking waterpark.

17:48.033 --> 17:49.601
I was sad Sophie's leaving,

17:49.668 --> 17:52.504
but fuck that shit.
We're going to a waterpark

17:52.571 --> 17:54.973
and they're my favourite thing
in the world!

18:09.121 --> 18:10.889
This waterpark looks amazing.

18:10.956 --> 18:13.358
I'm not gonna lie.
My knee is loads better.

18:13.425 --> 18:16.528
But crutches are getting me
sympathy shags from Marnie,

18:16.595 --> 18:20.165
so do I stick with that or do I go
on the slides? What a dilemma.

18:20.232 --> 18:22.201
You should take it off
and go with it.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.368
(laughs)

18:23.435 --> 18:26.238
As much as I love you, Aaron,
I just want us to have fun,

18:26.305 --> 18:28.640
not be stuck here
on the loungers all day.

18:28.707 --> 18:31.677
It clicked in earlier
and doesn't seem so bad, so...

18:31.743 --> 18:33.145
Let's have a little look.

18:34.279 --> 18:37.549
(laughs) There's nothing there.
Right. Aaron!

18:37.616 --> 18:39.284
What the fuck is that?

18:39.351 --> 18:41.420
It's a tiny little scratch.

18:41.487 --> 18:43.589
You've been doing this
for attention.

18:43.655 --> 18:46.725
I can't deal with you.
You are a baby.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.429
I've been busted, but fuck it.
I'm away on the slides.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.999
(screams)

18:56.835 --> 19:00.772
Forget my knee. I think I've just
dislocated both my balls.

19:15.554 --> 19:17.756
(both scream)

19:28.433 --> 19:31.169
Last night, Chloe promised
she wouldn't kick off

19:31.236 --> 19:33.338
and she didn't
and I'm proud of that.

19:33.405 --> 19:34.940
I know how much she likes him.

19:35.007 --> 19:38.277
Tonight, I've got a plan
that'll help her get over him.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.546
We need to help her
get with someone else.

19:40.612 --> 19:43.348
She's not gonna do that.
She's all mouth, no action.

19:43.415 --> 19:47.252
But we need to put her mouth
in action and get a dick in it.

19:47.319 --> 19:50.088
Nathan's telling us
that we need to get Chloe a man

19:50.155 --> 19:52.858
to get over Marty.
I don't know if it's gonna work.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.093
We all know what Chloe's like.

19:55.160 --> 19:59.298
To show solidarity in this
and to show that I'm a good friend,

19:59.364 --> 20:01.199
and so that she has to go along,

20:01.266 --> 20:03.302
I'm gonna shave my hair off.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.938
But if I shave my hair off,
the conditions are

20:06.004 --> 20:07.706
she has to stick to the plan.

20:07.773 --> 20:10.242
She can never kick off
and cry over him again.

20:10.309 --> 20:13.612
Nathan's gonna shave his head
in support of Chloe.

20:13.679 --> 20:15.213
If it works, brilliant.

20:15.280 --> 20:19.451
If it doesn't, we're gonna have an
angry, bald Nathan. Also brilliant.

20:29.695 --> 20:32.130
Ow! My fanny!
(they laugh)

20:32.197 --> 20:36.735
Ah, shit! I think I've just ripped
my fanny clean off. Where's it gone?

20:36.802 --> 20:38.170
Oh, my God.

20:41.039 --> 20:42.174
Whoa!

20:42.240 --> 20:44.977
If she kicks off,
I'm not talking to her again.

20:45.043 --> 20:47.479
If it works,
then that's fucking great for me.

20:47.546 --> 20:49.181
Take it off.
What's wrong?

20:49.247 --> 20:53.018
I look like Lord fucking Voldemort.
That's what's wrong with it.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.354
Whoa.
Nathan turned into a Creme Egg.

20:56.388 --> 20:58.924
Marty, look what I've got.
Oh, sorry.

20:58.991 --> 21:02.894
I didn't think she'd bring that lad
home, let alone rub it in my face.

21:03.895 --> 21:05.263
God, that's fucking big.

21:05.330 --> 21:07.466
(all) Geordie Shore! Why-aye!

21:10.469 --> 21:10.669
.

21:13.205 --> 21:13.405
.

21:27.319 --> 21:31.089
Right, it's time to shave my hair
off to help Chloe get over Marty.

21:31.156 --> 21:33.759
And I better do it now
before I change my mind.

21:33.825 --> 21:36.228
Please can I have that chair?
Oh, OK.

21:36.294 --> 21:38.797
OK, King Nathan.
We need to speak to you.

21:38.864 --> 21:40.332
Me?
Yeah.

21:40.399 --> 21:42.367
About what? Oh, God.

21:42.434 --> 21:45.103
Oh, shit. Nathan says
he wants to talk to us.

21:45.170 --> 21:48.807
He sounds serious, but I've not
done anything wrong today, have I?

21:48.874 --> 21:51.777
Me and Marnie have talked today.
We came up with a plan.

21:51.843 --> 21:55.547
And you're gonna have to go along.
We're taking it to the next level.

21:55.614 --> 21:58.583
If you backtrack on this,
I will never talk to you again.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.085
Is it a big thing?
Yeah.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.988
I just hope they're not
shaving her fanny in here

22:03.055 --> 22:04.690
cos that's unhygienic.

22:04.756 --> 22:07.359
What, cut my hair?
We're not gonna cut your hair.

22:07.426 --> 22:10.962
We feel like you should
stop kicking off and ruining nights.

22:11.029 --> 22:15.200
We're gonna find you someone to get
under so you can get over Martin.

22:15.267 --> 22:19.638
Get over to get under? Eh? I don't
know what Marnie's talking about.

22:19.705 --> 22:21.440
I like the sound of another lad.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.642
To show that
we're committed to this,

22:23.709 --> 22:25.243
I'm gonna shave off my hair.

22:26.478 --> 22:29.948
Right, are you being serious?
That's why we have this here.

22:30.015 --> 22:34.286
Bullshit. You'll look like a massive
dildo if you shaved your head.

22:34.352 --> 22:36.655
Would you vibrate
if I put batteries in you?

22:36.722 --> 22:40.325
This hair represents the shit times
that you used to argue with.

22:40.392 --> 22:42.561
I'll take the first chunk.

22:42.627 --> 22:45.764
Ooh! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
(laughs)

22:45.831 --> 22:47.866
That I did not expect to see.

22:47.933 --> 22:50.702
I thought Nathan
was giving it the big bollocks

22:50.769 --> 22:52.370
to try and get Chloe to change.

22:54.406 --> 22:57.109
Nathan, I can't believe
you're doing this for us.

22:57.175 --> 22:58.844
You don't have to do this.

23:07.519 --> 23:11.923
I've been in the hospital since last
night and thank fuck I'm going home.

23:11.990 --> 23:14.659
I hope the others
have been doing shit jobs

23:14.726 --> 23:17.129
and I haven't missed out
on anything good.

23:21.633 --> 23:23.602
(laughs)
Hi, Marty.

23:23.668 --> 23:26.004
(laughs)

23:26.071 --> 23:29.641
Whoa! What's happened here?
Feeling better?

23:29.708 --> 23:30.776
I love that.

23:30.842 --> 23:33.378
I'm glad Marty's back and he's OK.

23:33.445 --> 23:35.814
We need to speak,
but I can't face it just yet.

23:35.881 --> 23:37.749
Why have you done that to your head?

23:37.816 --> 23:40.619
We're sick of her
kicking off with you. Right.

23:40.685 --> 23:44.322
So, we decided that we're gonna try
and get Chloe to kiss a boy

23:44.389 --> 23:46.358
or do something to get over you.

23:46.424 --> 23:50.562
But the hair on my head marked the
times which were bad for yous two.

23:50.629 --> 23:53.932
If she kicks off after this,
I'm not talking to her again.

23:53.999 --> 23:56.768
Cos I'm bald now!
That's a good idea, actually.

23:56.835 --> 23:59.504
And if it works,
then that's fucking great for me.

23:59.571 --> 24:01.873
In fact,
I'd even help her find a new fella.

24:09.214 --> 24:11.683
(gasps) There's a spider on the wall!

24:11.750 --> 24:13.718
(they scream)

24:13.785 --> 24:15.921
Look at that big tarantula!
Gary!

24:15.987 --> 24:18.356
Stand back, women. Leave this to me.

24:18.423 --> 24:19.925
Oh, my God! (indistinct)

24:19.991 --> 24:21.960
(they scream)

24:23.595 --> 24:25.864
Thanks, Gary.
You're more pussy than us.

24:25.931 --> 24:27.766
I knew we should've called Nathan.

24:27.833 --> 24:30.435
(screams) It jumped!
It's a jumper!

24:39.878 --> 24:43.982
We're all looking and smelling good.
Even Chloe, and that makes a change.

24:44.049 --> 24:47.619
We're just waiting for Nathan to
neck some drinks and hit the club.

24:47.686 --> 24:50.422
Take it off.
I'm quite happy with a hat on.

24:50.488 --> 24:54.359
What's wrong with it?
I look like Lord fucking Voldemort.

24:54.426 --> 24:57.362
Look at that! Look at that!
(laughter)

24:57.429 --> 24:59.331
Whoa. Hang on a minute.

24:59.397 --> 25:02.801
Nathan turned into a Creme Egg.
What has happened to him?

25:02.868 --> 25:04.803
It looks blonde.

25:04.870 --> 25:08.840
There's never been a time I haven't
wanted to look at my own reflection.

25:08.907 --> 25:11.576
Now I can't bare the thought
of looking at myself.

25:11.643 --> 25:13.144
To the Malteser!

25:15.614 --> 25:18.283
Right, get me to the club
cos tonight is my night.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.286
I'm gonna get over Marty
by getting under someone else.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.554
Hopefully it works.

25:28.526 --> 25:32.464
We're all on fire tonight.
We might even melt Club Ice.

25:32.530 --> 25:35.467
It's already bouncing
when we get there. Bring it on.

25:35.533 --> 25:39.838
(dance music)

25:39.905 --> 25:43.408
I'm not gonna pull.
I'm gonna leave that to Chloe.

25:43.475 --> 25:47.345
When she does, it'll give me a free
pass to do whatever I want tomorrow.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.986
I'm having a mint time.

25:55.053 --> 25:58.657
The drinks are flowing, the music's
blasting and I'm horny as hell.

25:58.723 --> 26:01.026
There's one thing I need to do.

26:05.997 --> 26:08.400
Chloe is about to go
and talk to Marty

26:08.466 --> 26:10.568
and if anything kicks off,

26:10.635 --> 26:13.972
I will grab that weave from
her skull and put it on my head.

26:28.486 --> 26:30.255
Chloe's rocked over for a chat.

26:32.691 --> 26:35.593
I hope this goes well
for everyone else's sake.

26:44.602 --> 26:46.705
Just friends? Who am I kidding?

26:46.771 --> 26:50.608
I like him a lot. Let's hope Marnie
and Nathan can help me pull a fitty

26:50.675 --> 26:53.044
so I can under him
and get over Marty.

26:54.946 --> 26:58.850
Finally, but I'll believe it when
I see it. I'll give it two drinks.

27:05.790 --> 27:09.361
I'm glad we've made up. We're back
to flirting far too quickly.

27:09.427 --> 27:13.031
Shit. It's best for everyone
if she goes and pulls someone else.

27:15.633 --> 27:19.104
I wanna kiss him, but I can't.
I need to find some fresh meat.

27:37.956 --> 27:41.259
Marnie and me are wing-manning Chloe
cos she's horny as fuck.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.228
Now let's go get this bitch laid.

27:57.675 --> 27:59.077
Something's up with Gary.

27:59.144 --> 28:02.347
Usually he's cracking on with girls
the minute he steps out,

28:02.414 --> 28:06.117
but he hasn't pulled in the last
couple of days. Something's up.

28:09.654 --> 28:12.757
You wanna what? After everything
you've done to the girl?

28:26.104 --> 28:28.807
I finally realised
that I wanna be with Charlotte.

28:28.873 --> 28:32.477
I might've fucked things up,
but I've gotta give it another go.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.413
If that means not pulling
for the rest of the time,

28:35.480 --> 28:36.714
that's what I'll do.

28:37.849 --> 28:40.885
It's great that Gary's
realised his true feelings,

28:40.952 --> 28:43.254
but for me, it's just too late.

28:46.224 --> 28:49.928
Me and my wingmen have scouted
the club and I've found my target

28:49.994 --> 28:52.230
and horny Chloe
is going in for the kill.

28:54.732 --> 28:59.070
The lad that Chloe's pulled
isn't too bad looking. Go on, lass.

29:00.405 --> 29:05.210
I am buzzing. I've gone from being
a curly-headed fuck to Cupid.

29:05.276 --> 29:06.644
(indistinct)

29:06.711 --> 29:10.248
Everything has gone to plan. That
means free pass for me tomorrow.

29:11.516 --> 29:14.385
Let me see
what this stallion is made of.

29:23.528 --> 29:27.465
I am so happy that shaving my head
wasn't for nothing.

29:27.532 --> 29:29.567
What would happen
if I shaved my pubes?

29:33.171 --> 29:36.641
We've smashed this place.
We've got drunk. Chloe's pulled.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.243
Time to get back to the villa.

29:38.309 --> 29:42.080
I've only just started having fun.
I'll see yous later.

29:42.147 --> 29:44.315
Me and my new boyfriend
are staying here.

30:09.974 --> 30:12.544
I get back to the villa
with my boyfriend-to-be.

30:12.610 --> 30:16.548
Before we get hanky panky,
Marty, look what I've got!

30:18.550 --> 30:19.684
Oh, sorry. Come on.

30:19.751 --> 30:21.119
Chloe is taking the piss.

30:21.186 --> 30:24.656
I didn't think she'd bring
that lad home, let alone rub it in.

30:24.722 --> 30:27.492
That bed, not that bed, OK?

30:27.559 --> 30:31.229
Chloe, I am over the moon for you,
but please don't shag in my bed.

30:31.296 --> 30:33.331
I don't wanna catch your crabs.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.402
God, that's fucking big!

30:48.146 --> 30:50.014
(shrieks)

30:50.081 --> 30:51.849
Top shagger. Top shagger.

30:51.916 --> 30:53.718
It's made us feel ten times worse.

30:53.785 --> 30:57.088
The Marty pulling machine
is in full force.

30:57.155 --> 30:59.624
Marty swapped his free pass
for a two-for-one.

31:00.825 --> 31:03.528
I'm not kissing one.
I'm going for the tricycle.

31:03.595 --> 31:05.863
Marty's a dick and I swilled him.

31:05.930 --> 31:07.432
(glasses shatter)

31:08.399 --> 31:11.069
I fucked up,
but Aaron made it ten times worse.

31:14.472 --> 31:16.841
(all) Geordie Shore! Why-aye!

31:18.943 --> 31:19.143
.

31:21.679 --> 31:21.879
.

31:21.946 --> 31:25.049
'This part contains loads more
strong language, sex talk,

31:25.116 --> 31:28.753
plus some very aggressive behaviour.
You have been warned.'

31:38.496 --> 31:40.932
Morning, glory.

31:40.999 --> 31:42.867
I've woken up in the lads' room.

31:42.934 --> 31:46.738
Last night I gave Chloe the girls'
room so she could get shagged.

31:46.804 --> 31:49.207
Let's go for some breakfast.

31:51.609 --> 31:53.745
Morning. Morning, babe.

31:55.246 --> 31:59.317
I'm so loved up right now. My life's
just like one big, huge heart emoji.

32:02.787 --> 32:06.524
That means we're past the honeymoon.
We're in husband and wife mode.

32:06.591 --> 32:09.093
Right, you need to slow down, pet.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.429
We're acting like a normal couple,

32:11.496 --> 32:13.831
without all the head fucks
and mind games.

32:16.134 --> 32:19.737
Last night was good, though.
I had such a good time.

32:19.804 --> 32:22.106
How're you feeling?
I could not be happier.

32:22.173 --> 32:24.575
I was sitting there,
thinking, "Tonight!"

32:24.642 --> 32:27.145
Whoa.
(laughs)

32:27.211 --> 32:31.783
Everyone was expecting me to be
jealous when Chloe pulled that lad,

32:31.849 --> 32:33.651
but I felt like shaking his hand.

32:33.718 --> 32:36.054
He is a walking, talking favour.

32:36.120 --> 32:40.158
Mate, I was bouncing around. That's
how happy I was. I was ecstatic.

32:40.224 --> 32:43.561
I love Marty's optimism.
He thinks just cos Chloe's pulled

32:43.628 --> 32:46.397
that he's in the clear.
Yeah, that's gonna happen.

32:46.464 --> 32:48.866
I honestly think
that kid's still here.

32:48.933 --> 32:50.668
Should we go and check?

32:52.704 --> 32:54.572
My nosy nature's got the best of me.

32:54.639 --> 32:58.209
I need to find out if Chloe shagged
this lad and if he's still here.

32:58.276 --> 33:00.244
Oh.
Oh, boring.

33:00.311 --> 33:02.080
Morning.
Hi!

33:02.146 --> 33:05.850
As if I would let that poor boy
hang around and meet you radgies.

33:05.917 --> 33:08.052
He's done his service,
then fucked off.

33:08.119 --> 33:09.620
Did you shag?

33:09.687 --> 33:11.422
Yes.
(shrieks)

33:11.489 --> 33:14.325
Top shagger. Top shagger.
Top shagger.

33:14.392 --> 33:16.928
Was it good?
It was so big.

33:16.994 --> 33:20.131
It was a massive cucumber.

33:20.198 --> 33:22.166
I'm so pleased that Chloe pulled.

33:22.233 --> 33:24.802
I'm not convinced
it's enough to get over Marty.

33:24.869 --> 33:26.904
What are you gonna do
when Marty pulls?

33:26.971 --> 33:29.440
Nothing.
He didn't kick off at all.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.042
I'm not gonna do anything.

33:31.109 --> 33:32.677
I'm pleased.
I'm happy.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.479
Thank you.
Well done, guys.

33:37.248 --> 33:39.484
I am not hanging round
this villa all day.

33:39.550 --> 33:41.285
I'm going to the beach.

33:41.352 --> 33:44.389
Snorkelling, jet-skiing,
anything but this.

33:44.455 --> 33:46.224
I'm gonna work on my tans.

33:46.290 --> 33:48.559
Fuck that. I'm not going nowhere.

33:48.626 --> 33:51.262
Have you seen my tan? No.
Cos it doesn't exist.

33:51.329 --> 33:54.198
What are you staying for?
Me? I don't like sand.

33:54.265 --> 33:55.466
Going to see fishies!

34:01.706 --> 34:03.007
This is nice.

34:03.074 --> 34:05.042
We get to the beach and it's unreal.

34:05.109 --> 34:09.112
It's nice to see parts of Ayia Napa
that don't include the strip.

34:11.949 --> 34:14.619
It's nice to get out
of that fucking madhouse.

34:14.685 --> 34:16.554
Marty, get your snorkel.

34:18.089 --> 34:21.324
This is lush, to be fair. It's
better than sitting by the pool.

34:21.391 --> 34:22.927
The sea's so blue, isn't it?

34:22.994 --> 34:26.164
I'm sat with Chloe. Considering
she got bucked last night,

34:26.230 --> 34:28.900
she doesn't look very happy.
I'd be grinning.

34:28.966 --> 34:31.768
So last night, you made love.
(chuckles)

34:31.835 --> 34:34.304
How do you feel?
You don't look happy about it.

34:35.306 --> 34:36.440
(sighs)

34:37.442 --> 34:41.245
I just regret it.
I-I-I thought that...

34:41.312 --> 34:43.080
Don't cry. Don't cry.
(cries)

34:43.147 --> 34:44.549
Aww.

34:45.683 --> 34:48.886
I was trying to get over Marty,
but I like him so much,

34:48.953 --> 34:51.322
shagging that lad
wasn't gonna change that.

34:51.389 --> 34:52.790
(cries)

34:55.760 --> 34:57.027
You all right?

34:58.296 --> 35:02.166
I just thought it would help us
get over him, but it's not.

35:02.233 --> 35:05.336
Like, it's made us feel
ten times worse.

35:05.403 --> 35:09.440
Like, I've not felt this way
about someone before. (sniffles)

35:09.507 --> 35:10.808
I feel so bad for Chloe.

35:10.875 --> 35:14.178
Her head's mixed up
and she doesn't know what to do.

35:14.245 --> 35:17.949
I think, personally, your plan
for tonight should be don't drink.

35:18.015 --> 35:20.651
You might be tempted to kick off.

35:20.718 --> 35:23.020
I don't wanna kick off.
I know.

35:23.087 --> 35:25.523
But you can't
cos I don't have hair on my head.

35:25.590 --> 35:29.126
I might not have Marty any more,
but at least I've still got Nathan.

35:29.193 --> 35:31.295
It's a shame
he can't be my boyfriend.

35:32.864 --> 35:36.334
That's weird. Your head went down.
Let's never hug again.

35:45.276 --> 35:46.277
(phone rings)

35:46.344 --> 35:47.478
Ah!
Ah!

35:47.545 --> 35:49.547
Ring, ring, ring. Ring-a-ding.

35:49.614 --> 35:52.183
We're back five minutes
and the phone rings.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.685
I guarantee you I know who that is.

35:56.487 --> 35:58.689
I'm good. You? (clears throat)

36:04.762 --> 36:07.665
(chuckles) Some VIPs. Right.

36:07.732 --> 36:11.068
Anna wants me, Marty and Aaron
to go entertain some VIPs.

36:11.135 --> 36:13.004
I think that can be done.

36:16.107 --> 36:18.643
The Marty pulling machine
is in full force.

36:18.709 --> 36:21.946
I can already tell this night
is gonna be fucking mint.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.014
Goodbye.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.449
Bye!
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

36:25.516 --> 36:27.351
Bye! Bye!

36:34.959 --> 36:36.861
Oy, oy!
Oy, oy!

36:36.928 --> 36:39.764
Me, Gaz and Aaron get to work
to meet the VIP guests

36:39.830 --> 36:42.700
and it's just ten fit birds.

36:42.767 --> 36:44.802
Oh! Put me in for overtime.

36:44.869 --> 36:47.905
I haven't even got one!
One, two, three, cheers!

36:49.807 --> 36:53.177
Anna did say "entertain" these VIPs.

36:53.244 --> 36:55.446
What better way
than pass the ice cube?

37:00.284 --> 37:02.253
I can't get involved
in ice cube games

37:02.320 --> 37:04.422
because Marnie
will cut my balls off.

37:04.488 --> 37:07.291
The only person
passing me the ice cube is Gaz.

37:07.358 --> 37:08.826
Oh!

37:09.927 --> 37:11.829
Gaz and Aaron might be necking,

37:11.896 --> 37:14.865
but there's a fit bird on my team.
I'm gonna neck with her.

37:21.439 --> 37:24.875
Fucking hell, Marty. How'd you
manage that, you podgy devil?

37:27.712 --> 37:30.648
I need to put this free pass
in full use.

37:30.715 --> 37:34.485
So I've asked this blonde bird
to meet us at the club later. Bosh.

37:41.759 --> 37:43.527
I am so excited for tonight.

37:43.594 --> 37:47.264
All the lads are at work. The girls
and Nathan can go for pre-drinks

37:47.331 --> 37:49.200
and just have a bloody lovely time.

37:54.305 --> 37:57.241
It's took me and Aaron so long
to get where we are today,

37:57.308 --> 38:00.478
I couldn't be happier. I don't want
things to ever change.

38:02.313 --> 38:04.649
(they cheer)

38:04.715 --> 38:07.318
Marnie has just dropped the L bomb.
What the hell?

38:09.186 --> 38:12.423
I'm so happy for them, but I wish
me and Marty were in love.

38:19.030 --> 38:21.999
All right, girls,
thank you for coming.

38:22.066 --> 38:23.868
It's been a pleasure.

38:23.934 --> 38:26.570
Right... Geordie Tours is done.

38:26.637 --> 38:29.440
Now it's time to get the others
and hit the club.

38:35.546 --> 38:36.914
Oy, oy!

38:38.749 --> 38:43.654
Marnie must've missed us. Tonight
is definitely gonna be a good night.

38:46.891 --> 38:49.393
It's time to hit the club.
I can't wait.

38:55.332 --> 38:57.334
This club is amazing.

38:57.401 --> 39:00.237
I'm sticking to my promise
and I'm not gonna kick off.

39:00.304 --> 39:02.773
I'm gonna have a lovely jubbly time.

39:08.079 --> 39:12.116
What a belter. That bird from work's
turned up and brought her mate.

39:14.285 --> 39:17.655
I'm not just kissing one.
I'm going for the tricycle.

39:17.722 --> 39:21.525
Fucking hell. Marty swapped his
free pass for a two-for-one voucher

39:21.592 --> 39:23.961
and that kid isn't wasting any time.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.500
Marty's pulled. I'm keeping my cool.

39:29.567 --> 39:31.969
I'm stood there
like the Angel of the North.

39:32.036 --> 39:34.004
She's a statue. She doesn't move.

39:36.173 --> 39:38.609
Chloe keeps looking at us
with these birds.

39:38.676 --> 39:41.245
Sorry, darling.
Tongue-fest for three only.

39:43.013 --> 39:47.051
I'm not having Marty upset my Chloe.
I'm not having it.

39:49.186 --> 39:52.690
All of a sudden,
Marnie swills the three of wuh.

39:52.757 --> 39:56.026
Marty's a dick and I swilled him
and I'm not sorry.

39:57.027 --> 40:00.397
Shock. Once again,
Marnie has decided to throw her nose

40:00.464 --> 40:02.967
in other people's businesses.
Here we go.

40:04.201 --> 40:05.603
Two can play that game.

40:05.669 --> 40:08.038
(glasses shatter)

40:08.105 --> 40:11.342
Why the fuck am I the one
standing here soaking wet?

40:11.408 --> 40:14.078
Marnie, this has got
nothing to do with us.

40:18.048 --> 40:21.719
I can't believe Marnie has done that.
She has definitely got my back.

40:21.786 --> 40:23.687
But I thought we were being cool.

40:31.929 --> 40:34.799
Why would I stick up for Marnie?

40:39.270 --> 40:43.207
Of course I've taken Marty's side
over yours. You're in the wrong.

40:50.714 --> 40:53.984
I am sick to death
of having a boyfriend

40:54.051 --> 40:57.588
who chooses to stick up and stand up
for everyone other than me.

40:57.655 --> 40:59.390
It's driving us nuts.

41:01.192 --> 41:02.893
Why do things always get messy?

41:02.960 --> 41:05.763
It's time to get out
before things go west again.

41:07.998 --> 41:10.935
No way I'm bringing
these birds back to the villa

41:11.001 --> 41:15.005
with mental Marnie and crazy Chloe.
God knows what'll happen to them.

41:20.644 --> 41:24.215
Tonight has been a disaster.
Fuck this. I'm going to bed.

41:31.355 --> 41:35.726
You threw a full glass off Martin.

41:35.793 --> 41:37.628
No one's done that for us before.

41:37.695 --> 41:39.797
Marnie has been
such an amazing friend.

41:39.864 --> 41:43.667
I can't believe she stuck up for us.
I hope her and Aaron are all right.

41:43.734 --> 41:45.736
Martin threw it at Aaron.

41:45.803 --> 41:48.138
I know,
but the thing is about Martin,

41:48.205 --> 41:51.442
I'm upset about him and I love him,
but you are more important.

41:51.508 --> 41:54.745
This isn't about Marty any more.
This is about me and Aaron

41:54.812 --> 41:57.348
and how he doesn't
act like a proper boyfriend.

41:57.414 --> 41:59.049
It's driving us insane.

42:00.050 --> 42:05.256
Can you imagine, Chloe walked that
lad in last night and I went swill?

42:05.322 --> 42:07.358
And she went,
"What'd you do that for?"

42:07.424 --> 42:09.927
and I went, "Marty's my mate,
so I swilled him."

42:09.994 --> 42:11.829
Marnie's in the wrong.

42:11.896 --> 42:14.798
Unless she apologises
and explains why she kicked off,

42:14.865 --> 42:15.933
I won't talk to her.

42:16.000 --> 42:20.371
I never thought that would result
in Aaron doing what he did.

42:20.437 --> 42:23.140
Aaron doesn't agree
with everything I do,

42:23.207 --> 42:26.010
but he shouldn't take Marty's side
and go against us.

42:26.076 --> 42:28.412
I'm his fucking girlfriend.

42:28.479 --> 42:31.949
Marnie and Chloe can fuck clean off.
They ruined my threesome.

42:32.016 --> 42:32.983
We're done.

42:45.529 --> 42:47.164
(screaming)

42:47.231 --> 42:49.566
Happy birthday!
(screams)

42:49.633 --> 42:51.802
We hate each other,
but happy birthday.

42:51.869 --> 42:54.905
Oy, oy!
Oh, my God! It's Kyle!

42:54.972 --> 42:58.509
Stop flirting with us. I'm trying
to pretend I don't fancy him.

42:58.575 --> 43:01.278
Me and Marnie,
we're practically married.

43:01.345 --> 43:03.981
It all came crashing down
over a stupid argument.

43:04.048 --> 43:06.917
I don't want someone like that.
I don't like you.

43:06.984 --> 43:08.619
Who else wants some? Come on.

43:08.686 --> 43:11.488
Where's your friends?
You're fat as fuck!

43:11.555 --> 43:13.257
He's got no respect for anyone.

43:13.324 --> 43:16.627
How could he make me feel
so insecure?

43:41.452 --> 43:41.652
.
