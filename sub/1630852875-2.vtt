00:17.251 --> 00:19.184

my brother and Melissa.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.919

00:20.921 --> 00:23.589
He was just saying
my father has done things.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.690
- He said, "I am a terrible
person, I am a scumbag.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.726
Your father is the best.
I agree."

skeletons in their closet.

from the beginning,

00:36.069 --> 00:37.202

00:37.204 --> 00:38.804

- And you called her slutty.

You make it out like you're
better than everybody else.

00:40.340 --> 00:41.674

I'm better than--

- Everybody else.

You always say,
"Bill's the best."

00:45.946 --> 00:48.280
Listen, he had an affair.
- You're jealous.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.616
- Everybody knows, and that's
why he left his old job.

00:50.618 --> 00:53.218
Bill had the affair with the
office manager for two years.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.487
- She's not an office manager.

00:54.489 --> 00:56.321
She was a ----ing

- Managed through it.

01:09.436 --> 01:11.504

And it made us stronger.

01:11.506 --> 01:12.804

01:12.806 --> 01:14.306

I retaliate.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.579
Jennifer villainized me
for having an affair.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.380
- The way that she met
her husband

01:22.382 --> 01:23.716
I thought was very taboo.

01:23.718 --> 01:24.983
You know what, Margaret?

01:24.985 --> 01:26.852
You're used to an environment
of cheating.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.388
Your mother ----ed someone
for 15 years.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.756
I get it!

01:30.758 --> 01:32.724
- But your husband
was no different.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.660
- I could have lied about it,
and I didn't.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.461

biggest hypocrite.

01:36.463 --> 01:38.297

01:38.299 --> 01:40.165
- She's bringing up something
that, like,

01:40.167 --> 01:41.933
happened a long time ago,

01:41.935 --> 01:43.401

You want to get some food?

01:45.606 --> 01:47.874
You want me to get you
some more water?

01:47.876 --> 01:49.975
- She's just not honest
and up front.

01:49.977 --> 01:51.943
- Take a deep breath,
and tell me, what did I miss?

01:51.945 --> 01:53.412
- Hi, hi, hi, tell me.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.080
Everything okay?
How did it end?

01:55.082 --> 01:57.150
- Not good.
- What is going on?

01:57.152 --> 01:58.551
- I said to her,
"Just be honest."

01:58.553 --> 02:00.485
I've known about Bill's affair
for years.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.888
Anytime Jennifer's name
would come up,

02:02.890 --> 02:06.491
that would be the first story
endless people would say.

02:06.493 --> 02:08.393
And then when she said,
"My husband's the best.

02:08.395 --> 02:11.163
I have a great life,"
I go, "Just stop."

02:11.165 --> 02:13.632
It's not like I haven't
mentioned this before.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.233
- I'm secure in my marriage,

02:15.235 --> 02:17.702
so it doesn't bother me
where the (BLEEP) he sleeps.

02:17.704 --> 02:20.372
- I know, whether it's
in his girlfriend's bed or not.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.274
And she had such
a visceral reaction.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.942
- You better shut
the (BLEEP) up with that!

02:23.944 --> 02:25.911
- That I was like,
"I'm not doing this,"

02:25.913 --> 02:28.513
but tonight,
she just pushed me too far.

02:28.515 --> 02:31.317
I said, "Your husband
also had an affair."

02:31.319 --> 02:33.318
- Ooh.
- "And you worked it out."

02:33.320 --> 02:35.520
- And what'd she say?
- He did.

02:35.522 --> 02:38.090
- She said he did?
- Yes.

02:38.092 --> 02:39.457
- Wait a minute, wait.

02:39.459 --> 02:40.726
- She admitted it?
- But I was telling Margaret--

02:40.728 --> 02:42.193
- Yes.

02:42.195 --> 02:45.464
- I knew about Bill's affair
because Margaret told me.

02:45.466 --> 02:48.199
There's rumors about you, too,
so just be careful,

02:48.201 --> 02:50.402
because karma's a bitch.

02:50.404 --> 02:53.139
But I would never
have brought it up,

02:53.141 --> 02:55.073
because I know firsthand

02:55.075 --> 02:58.911
how bringing up infidelity
can hurt a couple.

02:58.913 --> 03:00.478
- Your ----ing husband's
cheating on you!

03:00.480 --> 03:01.513
That's why you're crying!

03:01.515 --> 03:03.081
- What was the fight about?

03:03.083 --> 03:05.884
- She just wanted to sabotage,
like, a happy home.

03:05.886 --> 03:06.952
- Happy home?

03:06.954 --> 03:08.387
Was there something, like,

03:08.389 --> 03:10.088

that I don't know about?

03:10.090 --> 03:11.356

it, you leave it where it is.

He's not even in this country.

of my house today

21:36.295 --> 21:39.497
because I am in packing hell.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.665
My kids are going away
for two weeks.

21:41.667 --> 21:43.133
- Where are they going?

21:43.135 --> 21:44.768
- We're flying them down
to Florida.

21:44.770 --> 21:47.005
All four of them
are going for 13 days.

21:47.007 --> 21:48.406
- It's like a camp?
- It's a camp.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.874
It's the summer program.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.942
- I feel like I need
to invite Jackie over

21:51.944 --> 21:54.412
because we made up
when we were at Teresa's party.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.146
- I'm gonna forgive her, okay?
- Okay.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.283
- So if you're a friend to me,
I'll be a friend to you.

21:58.285 --> 21:59.616
- Yeah.
- Okay?

21:59.618 --> 22:02.820
- And I feel like,
because Jackie and Evan

22:02.822 --> 22:04.822
went through something
similar last year...

22:04.824 --> 22:07.958
- Evan, how do you feel
you weathered the storm?

22:07.960 --> 22:10.395
- The main thing really was
my kids going on Google

22:10.397 --> 22:11.829
and checking out their dad--

22:11.831 --> 22:14.231
- I'm hoping that Jackie
can shed some light on this.

22:14.233 --> 22:18.836
- So I heard what happened
between you and Margaret.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.905
I know that she confronted you--

22:21.907 --> 22:23.841
- Did you know?
- With information about Bill.

22:23.843 --> 22:24.843
- Did you know that?

22:24.845 --> 22:27.711
- She told me, like,
a few months ago.

22:27.713 --> 22:31.181
Even though I knew,
I never said a word about it

22:31.183 --> 22:33.183
because honestly,
I don't want to hurt--

22:33.185 --> 22:34.452
- Yeah.
- Another woman.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.320
I felt bad.
- Mm-hmm.

22:36.322 --> 22:37.621
- Right, like--
- Sure.

22:37.623 --> 22:38.857
- If anybody can relate.

22:38.859 --> 22:40.992
- Right, especially--well,
I can't really relate

22:40.994 --> 22:42.526
because, like, the Evan thing
was just a rumor, but...

22:42.528 --> 22:43.660
- No, it was.

22:43.662 --> 22:45.797
- It was a mob,
and you said to me

22:45.799 --> 22:47.397
that you never
believed it anyway.

22:47.399 --> 22:48.866
- I don't.
- Okay.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.468
- No, and again, I don't even
want to bring it up,

22:50.470 --> 22:51.803
because it was last year,
and I don't...

22:51.805 --> 22:53.503
- Yeah.
- Want to do anything

22:53.505 --> 22:55.405
to make it seem like I'm trying
to hurt you, 'cause--

22:55.407 --> 22:56.874
- Right.
- That's not my intention.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.542
- Dolores, this woman,
since she met me,

22:58.544 --> 23:01.812
has attacked me for having
an affair, insulted my mother,

23:01.814 --> 23:05.015
then tried to drag my dear
friend Jackie through the mud.

23:05.017 --> 23:07.151
Calling up your own
ex-husband Frank

23:07.153 --> 23:08.686

23:08.688 --> 23:10.421

about the affair.

23:10.423 --> 23:11.956

- She called you?

23:11.958 --> 23:13.357
What'd she do?

23:13.359 --> 23:14.958
- Supposedly I have pictures--I
never even thought

23:14.960 --> 23:17.595
that Evan even cheated,
and supposedly I have pictures.

23:17.597 --> 23:20.164
- Horrible, I can't.
That's not for me.

23:20.166 --> 23:21.566

23:21.568 --> 23:23.100
<i>- Dolores and I have known,
for several months</i>

23:23.102 --> 23:26.437
that Jennifer was trying
to get dirt on Evan,

23:26.439 --> 23:28.372
from Frank,
but I've never told Jackie,

23:28.374 --> 23:30.040
because I know
she would just go crazy.

23:30.042 --> 23:32.077
And then I found out
she called my girlfriends

23:32.079 --> 23:34.111

friends--trying

23:34.113 --> 23:36.381
to shake them down saying,
"You know the gym he goes to.

23:36.383 --> 23:37.981
You live in Tenafly."

23:37.983 --> 23:39.249
- No, she didn't do that.
- "I'm trying to find out."

23:39.251 --> 23:41.152

- I don't like that, Margaret.

23:41.154 --> 23:42.853
What was she gonna do
with that information?

23:42.855 --> 23:45.623
- She wanted to see
someone else suffer, you know,

23:45.625 --> 23:46.924
and that's really what it was.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.258
- That really bothers me.

23:48.260 --> 23:52.997
- If we were really going
to try to be, like,

23:52.999 --> 23:55.465
good with each other,
I just would want to know that,

23:55.467 --> 23:57.635

any more of this, like, sneaky,

23:57.637 --> 23:59.670

other kind of stuff, you know.

23:59.672 --> 24:00.737

tried to do it to me.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.146
Is that okay?

24:08.148 --> 24:09.514
- I actually don't have
a problem

24:09.516 --> 24:10.815

and not just 'cause--

24:10.817 --> 24:12.417

I think that you've said
to her a million times

24:13.886 --> 24:16.421
how awful she is
for cheating on her husband.

24:16.423 --> 24:20.357
I don't think that Margaret
was wrong to come back at you.

24:20.359 --> 24:23.094

she did something wrong.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.527
- Wait, what's going on?
- No.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.462
I don't want to bring up
my husband's name anymore.

36:39.464 --> 36:40.831
As hard as everybody looked,

36:40.833 --> 36:42.265
they found nothing
on my ----ing husband,

36:42.267 --> 36:43.967
'cause there is nothing.

36:43.969 --> 36:46.570
- I was just asking
because it was curiosity.

36:46.572 --> 36:48.705
- But Jennifer, you looked
into my husband

36:48.707 --> 36:50.608
when your husband did stuff!

36:56.515 --> 36:58.115
Everybthey found nothing
on my ----ing husband

36:58.117 --> 36:59.415
'cause there is nothing.

36:59.417 --> 37:01.918
- I was just asking
because it was curiosity.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.187
- But Jennifer, you looked
into my husband

37:04.189 --> 37:06.490
when your husband did stuff!

37:06.492 --> 37:08.791
Why would you even
try to dig more?

37:08.793 --> 37:10.526
- It wasn't digging.
- Jen.

37:10.528 --> 37:11.795
- It's curiosity!

37:11.797 --> 37:13.663
It's human nature to be--

37:13.665 --> 37:15.665
- Oh, come on, Jennifer.

37:15.667 --> 37:18.135
You comment
on other people's marriages

37:18.137 --> 37:20.470
when you knew that there
was something in your past.

37:20.472 --> 37:22.005
- That happened ten years ago.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.206
- But you judge me

37:23.208 --> 37:24.941
about things that happened
30 years ago!

37:24.943 --> 37:27.277
- What you did was mean.
- I did nothing to you.

37:27.279 --> 37:29.412
- It was my children!
- Your children?

37:29.414 --> 37:31.215
Jennifer,
you've hurt endless people.

37:31.217 --> 37:34.552
- Okay, but you really
just hit below the belt.

37:34.554 --> 37:36.186
- Kids are resilient.
- My kids are resilient, okay.

37:36.188 --> 37:37.420
- You'll go to therapy,
and you'll work it out.

37:37.422 --> 37:38.888
- My babies.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.023
- Honey, we love your kids.
I think you--

37:40.025 --> 37:41.358
- No, don't.
- Have amazing children.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.459
And I also think
you're an amazing--

37:42.461 --> 37:43.760
- No.
- Mother.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.662
<i>- I've been friends
with Melissa for years,</i>

37:45.664 --> 37:47.563
so it's really hard for me
to take sides,

37:47.565 --> 37:50.767
<i>but it really is baffling
to me how she and Margaret</i>

37:50.769 --> 37:53.636
can't seem to understand
why Jennifer's falling apart.

37:53.638 --> 37:56.773
- Jennifer, don't cry
because there's no reason to.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.709
- You think I'm ----ing
weak for crying!

37:58.711 --> 38:00.643
- No!
- I'm not weak for crying!

38:00.645 --> 38:02.045
- I don't think--
- Okay?

38:02.047 --> 38:03.513
- You're weak for crying.
- I'm ----ing brave for crying.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.315
- Please, Melissa, understand,
you have kids.

38:05.317 --> 38:06.582
- I do understand.
- Okay.

38:06.584 --> 38:08.317
Just, like, all things aside.

38:08.319 --> 38:10.453
- Forget it, forget it.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.588
I mean, I want to talk this out
with Jennifer,

38:12.590 --> 38:14.557
but everybody's too emotional.

38:14.559 --> 38:16.025
We can't have a conversation.

38:16.027 --> 38:17.794
Let's drop it.
- Get her a drink.

38:17.796 --> 38:20.197
- Let's take a break
from this conversation.

38:20.199 --> 38:22.598
Let's eat.
Come on, let's drink.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.234
- Food makes everything better.
- Let's eat.

38:24.236 --> 38:27.136
- Yeah, let's get some more
champagne flowing, definitely.

38:27.138 --> 38:29.005
- Hello?
- Yes, I would take champagne.

38:29.007 --> 38:30.273
- Whoo!
- Sorry.

38:30.275 --> 38:32.041
- Hi.
All: Hi!

38:32.043 --> 38:34.744
- There she is.

38:34.746 --> 38:36.446
- Hi, honey, how are you?
- How are you doing?

38:36.448 --> 38:38.347
- How are you?
Sorry I'm late, guys.

38:38.349 --> 38:39.949
I had to take Audriana to dance.

38:39.951 --> 38:41.685
- Can I get you anything?
What would you like?

38:41.687 --> 38:43.152
- Oh, champagne.
- This is okay?

38:43.154 --> 38:44.353
- Yeah, yeah.
Okay, that's good.

38:44.355 --> 38:45.822
That's good.
Thank you.

38:45.824 --> 38:49.025
Oh, my God, it's, like,
such a beautiful place!

38:49.027 --> 38:50.293
- Thank you.
- I love it.

38:50.295 --> 38:51.929
- Jennifer?
- I'm good, thank you.

38:51.931 --> 38:53.463
- I think you can use
a little swing.

38:53.465 --> 38:54.831
- I'm okay.
- There you go.

38:54.833 --> 38:55.965
- So what did I miss?

38:55.967 --> 38:57.233
- So Jennifer comes
through the door,

38:57.235 --> 38:58.636
and she was a little shaky.

38:58.638 --> 39:02.506
And she starts, like, sobbing,
and then Margaret came over,

39:02.508 --> 39:04.640
and she was like,
"What are you crying for?"

39:04.642 --> 39:06.909
- What is she crying for?
She's hurt.

39:06.911 --> 39:08.978
- Margaret's main point was,

39:08.980 --> 39:10.347
"Stop being a ----ing hypocrite.

39:10.349 --> 39:13.583
You were, like,
searching for stuff on Jackie."

39:13.585 --> 39:16.019
She shouldn't have been--
- Wait, what'd she do?

39:16.021 --> 39:18.355
- She was asking people
who the girl was

39:18.357 --> 39:20.723
that Evan cheated on,
and it got back to them.

39:20.725 --> 39:22.191
She shouldn't have
----ing did that.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.994
- You don't think that
what Margaret did was wrong?

39:23.996 --> 39:25.329
- Would I have done it?
No.

39:25.331 --> 39:27.064
- That's crossing the line.
It really is.

39:29.867 --> 39:31.934
I gotta really pee.

39:31.936 --> 39:33.202
- Are you okay, Jen?

39:33.204 --> 39:35.204
- Truth be told, I'm struggling.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.073
- Yeah, I don't think
you're gonna sway Margaret.

39:37.075 --> 39:39.075
- But I don't think
I would ever say that, no.

39:39.077 --> 39:41.411
- Listen, Jennifer, I want you
to feel supported right now,

39:41.413 --> 39:42.813
but you need
to recognize your part.

39:42.815 --> 39:44.148
- Okay.

39:44.150 --> 39:46.283
- As frustrated
as I am with Jennifer...

39:46.285 --> 39:47.618
- I'm sorry.
- I know you are.

39:47.620 --> 39:49.086
- I really am.
- I know you are.

39:49.088 --> 39:50.653
<i>It's hard for me</i>

39:50.655 --> 39:52.155
to see another woman
going through so much pain.

39:52.157 --> 39:55.258
Listen, I'm not mad.
It actually feels good to me.

39:55.260 --> 39:57.026
Even if you did look,
nothing was there.

39:57.028 --> 39:58.961
I mean, I knew that,

39:58.963 --> 40:01.431
and I don't want
to bring him back into it.

40:01.433 --> 40:03.634
<i>But I can be the bigger person</i>

40:03.636 --> 40:06.403
because Jennifer definitely
needs support right now.

40:06.405 --> 40:07.904
- Guys, you guys
aren't eating enough.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.305
- I know.
What am I gonna eat next?

40:09.307 --> 40:10.907
- What is that?
- They're so cute.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.177
- Is that an alligator?
- Ahh, it's eating my hand!

40:13.179 --> 40:14.644
Oh, my God.

40:14.646 --> 40:15.913
- I'm gonna grab some
of that peach salad.

40:15.915 --> 40:18.781
- This looks really good,
this little turkey thing.

40:18.783 --> 40:20.617
- So Dolores filled me in
on what happened.

40:20.619 --> 40:22.118
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good, babe.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.087
Just, like, it was a lot,

40:24.089 --> 40:26.689
and I just want to,
like, process.

40:26.691 --> 40:28.724
- I don't want
to hurt her kids, and that's--

40:28.726 --> 40:30.927
- You would never.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.396
- Let's not forget,
Bill did cheat on Jennifer,

40:33.398 --> 40:35.399
<i>and that's what's painful
for her and the kids,</i>

40:35.401 --> 40:37.400
not that the truth
was made public.

40:37.402 --> 40:39.869
- Well, are you good
with Margaret?

40:39.871 --> 40:41.070
- We're working.

40:41.072 --> 40:42.873
- But can I just say
one thing, Margaret?

40:42.875 --> 40:43.940
- Yes.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.676
- Why was I such a bad person

40:46.678 --> 40:49.813
when I was telling you,
Dolores, and Melissa

40:49.815 --> 40:51.481
a rumor I heard about Jackie,

40:51.483 --> 40:56.219
but then you come to my party
and blast Jennifer?

40:56.221 --> 40:57.420
- 'Cause she went right
to Jennifer.

40:57.422 --> 40:58.821
You didn't come to me.

40:58.823 --> 41:01.425
- Would you want me to ruin--
- At his birthday party?

41:01.427 --> 41:02.960
- No, we're not going back.

41:02.962 --> 41:05.362
- We are not going there.
Jackie's not having it.

41:05.364 --> 41:06.963
- I don't think anyone liked
the way that happened.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.497
- No, I got crucified for it.

41:08.499 --> 41:12.201
- It just blows my mind,
still to this day,

41:12.203 --> 41:15.171
Teresa does not feel
like she did anything wrong.

41:15.173 --> 41:17.640
- Alls I was trying to do
was be a girl's girl.

41:17.642 --> 41:21.511
- I know that this rationale
is not making sense to anybody,

41:21.513 --> 41:24.248
<i>but to Teresa it's logical.</i>

41:24.250 --> 41:25.781
What do I say?

41:25.783 --> 41:27.250
- All right.
- Yes.

41:27.252 --> 41:29.652
- I mean, I don't get it.

41:29.654 --> 41:30.788
It's a different situation.

41:30.790 --> 41:32.989
I think Teresa personally
doesn't even care

41:32.991 --> 41:34.124
what I said to Jennifer,

41:34.126 --> 41:35.459
<i>as long as it makes
her look good.</i>

41:35.461 --> 41:36.927
<i>Like, "Oh, look.</i>

41:36.929 --> 41:38.929
Margaret did it too,
so what I did isn't as sh---y."

41:38.931 --> 41:41.998
Jennifer chastised me and
judged me for certain things

41:42.000 --> 41:44.200
that have been gone on
in her own backyard.

41:44.202 --> 41:45.268
- And you guys,
like, went at it?

41:45.270 --> 41:47.336
- It's like
I can't really be here.

41:47.338 --> 41:50.274
- But you can't say all these
horrible things to me,

41:50.276 --> 41:52.308
chastise me for cheating.

41:52.310 --> 41:54.310
But I don't think it compares.

41:54.312 --> 41:55.478
- I gotta go.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.413
- I wasn't trying
to get her upset.

41:57.415 --> 41:58.781
- I am very angry.

41:58.783 --> 42:00.417
