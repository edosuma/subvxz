<i>After 15 years
as a journalist,</i>

00:02.711 --> 00:04.629
<i>I've learned it's important to
grab the reader's attention</i>

00:04.629 --> 00:06.297
<i>with a catchy headline.</i>

00:06.297 --> 00:09.884
<i>Here's mine-- "Local Woman,
37, Ruins Own Life."</i>

00:09.884 --> 00:13.179
<i>Five years ago, Nell Serrano
threw away a promising career</i>

00:13.179 --> 00:14.848
<i>to move to London for a man.</i>

00:14.848 --> 00:16.766
I'm sleeping!

00:16.766 --> 00:18.351
<i>She went all-in on love.</i>

00:18.351 --> 00:20.395
<i>Until it drop-kicked her
in the face.</i>

00:20.395 --> 00:22.647
<i>Now she's back,
trying to stay hydrated.</i>

00:23.940 --> 00:26.776
<i>But hey, who needs
a promising career...</i>

00:27.694 --> 00:30.238
<i>...a fairy-tale wedding...</i>

00:30.238 --> 00:31.406
<i>...or clean underwear...</i>

00:31.406 --> 00:33.908
<i>when you can wear
bathing suit bottoms.</i>

00:33.908 --> 00:35.910
<i>Again.</i>

00:35.910 --> 00:39.039
<i>The good news is the weird
roommate I met on Craigslist</i>

00:39.039 --> 00:41.958
<i>is extremely laid back and
not passive aggressive at all.</i>

00:41.958 --> 00:44.669
<i>Oh, also, he makes me
walk his dog.</i>

00:44.669 --> 00:46.838
<i>Unfortunately,
he's a shy pooper.</i>

00:46.838 --> 00:49.382
<i>The dog, not the roommate.
That's gross.</i>

00:49.382 --> 00:51.217
<i>And all this made me late
for my first day</i>

00:51.217 --> 00:52.469
<i>back at my old job.</i>

00:52.469 --> 00:54.346
<i>But at least I got
the last parking spot,</i>

00:54.346 --> 00:55.597
<i>so things are looking up.</i>

00:56.598 --> 00:57.640
Oh.

01:00.685 --> 01:03.021
Oh. Sorry.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.151
Oh, my...

01:08.151 --> 01:09.778
I really gotta clean out
this trunk.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.947
<i>More on this
ongoing disaster as it unfolds.</i>

01:29.964 --> 01:31.257
- You are late.
- Oh.

01:31.257 --> 01:32.300
But I told everyone
that your phone

01:32.300 --> 01:33.551
was still set on UK time

01:33.551 --> 01:34.969
and that you
were donating blood.

01:34.969 --> 01:36.096
Okay?
So, act kinda woozy.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.138
What if I act hungover?

01:37.138 --> 01:38.264
What if I am hungover?

01:38.264 --> 01:40.225
So, I got you a plant
for your first day.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.768
- Hey.
- Of my old job?

01:41.768 --> 01:43.645
Yeah, and some pens
for your birthday.

01:43.645 --> 01:44.813
Oh, 'cause I'm another
year older?

01:44.813 --> 01:45.855
- Sports section.
- Oh.

01:45.855 --> 01:48.316
- Go long!
- No, because I love you, baby.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.068
- Aww.
- No stealing, girls.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.778
You are not
the boss of me.

01:51.778 --> 01:52.862
True, but I am
the boss of you.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.572
- Ooh.
- Is it weird?

01:54.572 --> 01:55.615
It's weird
that either of you

01:55.615 --> 01:56.950
are the bosses of anybody, really.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.326
Well, technically,
she is the boss...

01:58.326 --> 01:59.369
- Oh!
- ...of the lifestyle section...

01:59.369 --> 02:00.412
- MAN ♪2: Sorry!
- ...so that

02:00.412 --> 02:01.871
- doesn't really count.
- Ooh.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.498
Ooh.
"I'm Mr. Metro.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.458
I have to edit
a six-part series

02:05.458 --> 02:07.669
about the changes
in the zoning bylaws."

02:07.669 --> 02:10.130
I'm sorry, don't you have
a meeting to go to about...

02:10.130 --> 02:11.381
I want to say sandals.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.591
Look, bitch--

02:13.591 --> 02:15.719
Actually, I am late
to a meeting about sandals.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.178
- Oh.
- Ugh.

02:17.178 --> 02:18.722
- Coffee later?
- Yep.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.932
So, what are you
gonna put me on?

02:20.932 --> 02:22.517
City beat? Crime beat?

02:22.517 --> 02:24.269
The dead beat.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.229
Oh, my God, you're
putting me on obituaries?

02:26.229 --> 02:27.480
Here's
your new office.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.815
Ta-da.

02:28.815 --> 02:29.941
Ew.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.778
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie,
this is a closet.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.321
That seems generous.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.991
Look, you gotta jump back
in somewhere, Nell.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.243
Start here.
Your first obit.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.494
Monty Waxberg.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.706
A musician you may know
for his most famous jingle,

02:44.706 --> 02:45.832
the "Yummy Yum Bubble Gum" song.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.459
I hated that song as a kid.

02:47.459 --> 02:50.045
Don't judge a person
by their jingle, Nell.

02:50.045 --> 02:53.465
Everyone has a story,
and it's your job to find it.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.091
And don't touch that pipe.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.343
It'll strip your skin.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.098
This is on me.

03:02.098 --> 03:03.516
Just give me one sec.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.393
Oh, here, give me that.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.020
Oh! See?
This is why I love you.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.188
Still know how to party.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.564
Byow-byow-byow-byow!

03:09.564 --> 03:11.024
No.
Your airhorn's broken.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.109
That is because it is
a breast pump.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.155
Do you remember when these boobs
were for, like, flashing people?

03:17.155 --> 03:19.324
Now they are for
feeding people.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.575
What happened to me?

03:20.575 --> 03:23.036
You became
a badass working mom,

03:23.036 --> 03:25.455
who made two of my favorite
little humans.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.290
Yeah, I should warn you,

03:27.290 --> 03:29.417
Tilly still likes to wear
her flower girl dress

03:29.417 --> 03:31.711
to school every day,
in case that's a trigger.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.088
Way to punch down, Tilly.

03:33.088 --> 03:35.674
So, when you are ready
to talk about Phillip,

03:35.674 --> 03:38.134
I have a bunch of nasty things
I have written in my journal

03:38.134 --> 03:39.803
that I am so excited
to share with you.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.388
Eh, I don't want to do that.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.555
You know what I want to do
for my birthday?

03:42.555 --> 03:44.891
I just want to throw down
like we used to

03:44.891 --> 03:47.394
and pretend it's not gonna take
me three days to recover.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.063
- Okay?
- Okay!

03:50.063 --> 03:51.564
Oh, God. Oh, no.
Hide me.

03:51.564 --> 03:53.441
- Oh. Unh-uh. Nope. Hide me.
- What?

03:53.441 --> 03:55.777
- Oh, hide me.
- What? Why? Where? What? Who?

03:55.777 --> 03:57.612
It's Scotch Tape.

03:58.279 --> 03:59.239
Oh.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.449
Yeah, Nell, you can't call
her that anymore, okay?

04:01.449 --> 04:05.662
Lexi is your boss now,
and as crazy as it sounds,

04:05.662 --> 04:08.415
- we have actually become...
- I will smack your face.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.792
- ...work friends.
- What? We hate her!

04:10.792 --> 04:12.127
I know.
I'm so sorry.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.211
The only reason
why she has this job

04:13.211 --> 04:14.754
is because her dad
owns the newspaper.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.047
And half of Pasadena.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.757
Yeah, I know.
She's a little rich and weird,

04:17.757 --> 04:19.676
and she thinks that Old Navy
is a branch of the military,

04:19.676 --> 04:22.137
but when you are
a working mom,

04:22.137 --> 04:23.888
it is hard to meet
other working moms.

04:23.888 --> 04:27.017
What? No.
What about Tina from Metro?

04:27.017 --> 04:28.184
She used to always talk
about her kids.

04:28.184 --> 04:29.728
It was sweet.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.772
They were dolls.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.733
Everyone's really worried
about Tina.

04:37.193 --> 04:39.571
- Hi.
- Hi, Tina.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.741
What's this?

04:42.741 --> 04:45.744
You shouldn't have.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.997
Mmm.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.583
Let's hope there's no cherries
in this one.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.085
It's caramel.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.253
Mmm.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.755
Did you go to Stanford?

04:56.755 --> 04:58.256
Yeah.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.507
Why are you eating
the chocolates

04:59.507 --> 05:00.967
I got for my girlfriend?

05:02.218 --> 05:04.179
Because it's my birthday and I
thought you got them for me.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.597
No.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.350
Gross.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.185
I'm going to San Diego,
without chocolates,

05:10.185 --> 05:11.519
to visit my girlfriend.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.188
So, please remember
to walk Arthur

05:13.188 --> 05:14.856
and use compostable poop bags

05:14.856 --> 05:16.441
instead of telling the dog
just to hold it.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.318
And if you raise
the heat above 68,

05:18.318 --> 05:20.236
- the Nest will alert me.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.827
Do you have any plans
for your birthday?

05:27.827 --> 05:29.329
Oh, yeah.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.789
I'm gonna throw
a massive rager,

05:30.789 --> 05:32.707
and I'm thinking of getting
a couple of kegs

05:32.707 --> 05:33.833
and maybe even a reggae band,

05:33.833 --> 05:35.919
and I'm gonna do it right
over there by your Peloton.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.837
No! You can't do it here.
We have an agreement.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.422
Your lease specifically states
that any guests

05:39.422 --> 05:41.883
need to be pre-authorized...

05:41.883 --> 05:43.718
- You're joking?
- Obviously, dude.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.512
What, do you have like
Asperger's or something?

05:45.512 --> 05:47.347
I do.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.723
You do?

05:48.723 --> 05:50.308
Oh, my God, I am so sorry
I said that.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.602
I don't.
You thought I had Asperger's?

05:52.602 --> 05:54.646
I mean, kind of.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.231
I do.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.900
All right,
have a good weekend.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.197
- <i>Beam me up ♪</i>
- <i>Beam me up ♪</i>

06:04.197 --> 06:05.740
<i>Count me in ♪</i>

06:05.740 --> 06:07.075
Ah, thank you.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.746
Wow. $14 bucks
for a cocktail.

06:11.746 --> 06:12.956
You know, back in the day,

06:12.956 --> 06:15.333
we used to make
LSD in the bathtub

06:15.333 --> 06:18.086
and give it away for free!

06:18.086 --> 06:19.921
Ah, damn,
I miss the '90s.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.423
- Mm.
- Mm.

06:21.423 --> 06:24.134
How come your nose
is buried in your phone?

06:25.844 --> 06:27.762
Ah, honestly?

06:27.762 --> 06:31.016
I was wondering if
my ex-fiance was gonna bother

06:31.016 --> 06:32.183
to wish me a happy birthday,

06:32.183 --> 06:33.685
but so far, he hasn't, so...

06:33.685 --> 06:35.520
You know the best way
to get over someone?

06:35.520 --> 06:37.814
- Hmm?
- Get under someone else.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.275
Awesome.
Thank you for your wisdom.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.194
Hey!

06:43.194 --> 06:45.822
- There she is! My birthday girl!
- Hi!

06:45.822 --> 06:48.033
- Yes!
- Hi.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.117
Okay, I know you said
no presents,

06:49.117 --> 06:50.785
but we stopped
by the gas station

06:50.785 --> 06:54.456
- and got you a little something.
- Aww, you guys.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.499
Condoms and scratchers?

06:56.499 --> 06:58.752
'Cause you finna
get lucky this year!

06:58.752 --> 07:00.420
Hey! And we're gonna have
a great time tonight

07:00.420 --> 07:02.422
no matter who else
shows up.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.548
So...

07:03.548 --> 07:05.383
Who else is coming?

07:05.383 --> 07:06.551
Hi, squirrel friend.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.678
Sorry I'm late.

07:08.678 --> 07:12.766
Well, I hope it's not too weird
that I crashed your birthday.

07:12.766 --> 07:13.975
No.
Not at all.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.477
We're co-workers.

07:15.477 --> 07:18.229
Well, not exactly "co."

07:18.229 --> 07:20.357
Kidding.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.275
Although technically,
that is accurate.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.443
I mean, I am your boss.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.819
Right.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.488
But I just want you to know
that I'm going to strive

07:26.488 --> 07:28.823
to be a different kind of boss
than my father was.

07:28.823 --> 07:32.285
I mean, he was just so
aloof and out of touch,

07:32.285 --> 07:34.329
and if I learned anything
after I broke my back

07:34.329 --> 07:35.872
during the
Olympic Dressage trials,

07:35.872 --> 07:39.918
it's that you are only as strong
as the horse you're riding.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.295
- Mm.
- Mm.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.131
And you--
you are my horse.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.174
Hey, Lexi?

07:46.174 --> 07:48.677
Am I being weird
and entitled again?

07:48.677 --> 07:50.553
Yeah, when you referred to us
as your horse.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.389
See? This is why I need you.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.140
Oh, my gosh,
that reminds me.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.475
One weekend during quarantine

07:55.475 --> 07:56.768
when our families
podded together--

07:56.768 --> 07:58.103
Oh.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.479
You guys podded together?

07:59.479 --> 08:00.897
- Yeah.
- We did.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.024
And it was such fun.
Oh!

08:03.024 --> 08:05.568
I know a lot of people say
they didn't enjoy the pandemic,

08:05.568 --> 08:07.362
but I really thrived.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.782
Anyway, one night, Sam and I
got into le sauvignon blanc,

08:10.782 --> 08:13.618
and she got really
honest with me

08:13.618 --> 08:16.246
about how I can come off
to people,

08:16.246 --> 08:19.833
and I'm just very grateful
to have a friend

08:19.833 --> 08:21.501
like you in my life.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.420
I got you.

You're okay with her
being here, right?

08:32.345 --> 08:33.847
Totally.

08:33.847 --> 08:34.973
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.725
I guess I just didn't realize
you guys were, like,

08:36.725 --> 08:38.435
- friends-friends.
- I know.

08:38.435 --> 08:39.561
But it's fine.

08:39.561 --> 08:40.812
You just owe me
a do-over, yeah?

08:40.812 --> 08:42.397
- You got it.
- Yes!

08:42.397 --> 08:43.523
- Yes.
- Okay, so I got us two tickets

08:43.523 --> 08:45.150
to The Underground
this Saturday night.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.943
It's '80s Prom Night.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.111
I thought I'd wear
my wedding dress,

08:48.111 --> 08:49.904
you'd wear your
maid-of-honors dress.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.197
Might as well get
some use out of it.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.240
I would love to do it.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.034
It's just that
Saturday night,

08:54.034 --> 08:57.162
um, I have some plans--

08:57.162 --> 08:58.204
You have plans with Lexi.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.498
Yeah. I do. I do.

09:00.498 --> 09:04.461
<i>Don't go breaking my heart ♪</i>

09:04.461 --> 09:06.588
We almost got it.
It was almost there.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.800
Whoo! Whoo!

09:10.800 --> 09:12.344
Let's give it up for Dennis
and Scotch Tape!

09:13.219 --> 09:14.804
- Scotch Tape?
- Oh, yeah.

09:14.804 --> 09:15.847
It's just a nickname
we gave you, you know.

09:15.847 --> 09:18.266
Just some little inside joke
between old friends.

09:18.266 --> 09:19.309
Nell, Nell, slow down.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.685
- What? Come on.
- Nell.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.020
Scotch Tape.
Because you're stuck up.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.063
Get it?

09:23.063 --> 09:24.606
We also thought
you were Scottish.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.608
You screamed one day, and it
sounded like <i>Braveheart.</i>

09:26.608 --> 09:27.650
I was like, "Scottish."

09:27.650 --> 09:29.903
Come on.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.946
You think it's funny, right?

09:31.946 --> 09:34.074
I'm not the only one!

09:34.074 --> 09:35.116
Yeah, totally.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.785

Aah! Aah!

10:05.397 --> 10:07.524

10:08.274 --> 10:09.984
Don't you come any closer.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.027
Don't bother.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.445
I'm already dead.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.409

10:17.409 --> 10:19.411
Please don't do that.
Please, please don't do that.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.371
No, I am not here
to kill you.

the chili cheese fries

10:38.304 --> 10:40.098
and the cake
and the five cocktails

10:40.098 --> 10:41.266
and maybe
the half gummy I ate.

So, I--
I'm just gonna--

10:46.688 --> 10:48.440
I'm gonna go to my room,
and I'm gonna lock the door,

10:48.440 --> 10:50.525
and I'm gonna put a bunch
of heavy boxes in front of it.

10:50.525 --> 10:51.901
You know, not because
I think that you're real,

10:51.901 --> 10:54.487
but just because, uh--
um, I need the cardio.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.655

in the morning,

10:55.655 --> 10:56.865

- Aah!

11:13.048 --> 11:14.716

11:14.716 --> 11:16.509
How did you get past
the boxes?

11:16.509 --> 11:18.845
I have no idea.
I've never been dead before.

11:18.845 --> 11:22.265
Also, I haven't had to pee
since I died,

11:22.265 --> 11:24.059
which frees up
a lot of time.

- Come in.

No.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.738
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Good.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.073
Will you clean
the living room, please?

11:38.073 --> 11:39.908
Because it's filled
with condoms.

Duh. Yeah.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.827

11:42.827 --> 11:45.038
Okay, nice.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.333

No!

11:54.756 --> 11:55.924
This is not happening.

11:55.924 --> 11:56.966

11:56.966 --> 11:58.718
I know I've been sad lately,

11:58.718 --> 12:00.428
and maybe even
a little depressed, you know?

12:00.428 --> 12:02.013
And I haven't really been
taking good care of myself.

12:02.013 --> 12:04.557
Maybe I just need
to do more exercise.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.227
Oh, okay. Why don't we go
for a bike ride?

12:07.227 --> 12:08.770
No, thank you.
I need some air.

Hey, Siri, text Sam.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.777
"Sorry I got over-served
last night.

a cup of coffee later?"

12:30.875 --> 12:32.002

12:32.002 --> 12:33.795
- What?
- Just kidding.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.505
It was prostate cancer.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.636
Stop following me!

12:41.636 --> 12:43.138
Oh, God. Enough.

12:43.138 --> 12:44.472
What do I have to do
to get you to leave?

12:44.472 --> 12:45.765
I don't know.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.392
I have no idea why I'm here.

12:47.392 --> 12:48.935
No rules, no instructions.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.895
It's very poorly run.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.188
Okay, I've seen the movies.
There's gotta be

12:52.188 --> 12:53.606
some magic words
that I can say

12:53.606 --> 12:54.816
to get you to move on.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.317
Ooh, like, um--

12:56.317 --> 12:58.069
"I absolve you
of your messed up life."

12:58.069 --> 13:00.113
"Go to the light,
Carol Anne!"

13:01.489 --> 13:04.242
- My messed up life?
- Yes. Your messed up life.

13:04.242 --> 13:06.036
I don't know if you remember,
but I've been writing about you,

13:06.036 --> 13:08.288
and you're a dead,
twice-divorced, wannabe musician

13:08.288 --> 13:10.373
who wrote one jingle
that made me hate bubble gum.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.125
Uh-huh.
And what about you?

13:12.125 --> 13:13.543
I've been around you
for about 24 hours,

13:13.543 --> 13:15.170
and I can tell,
you're no prize.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.546
You drink too much,

13:16.546 --> 13:18.548
you're jealous of other
people's happiness,

13:18.548 --> 13:20.258
and you literally
just run away

13:20.258 --> 13:22.010
from any difficulty
in your life.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.555
I'm not doing this.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.223
I'm not getting psychoanalyzed
by some dead person.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.601
See?
You're running away.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.104
I am n-- No.

13:33.104 --> 13:34.647
No. Ah.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.067
Great. Thank you.
I just missed Sam's call.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.694
<i>Hey, I got your text.</i>

13:39.694 --> 13:41.613
<i>Last night got a little
out of hand.</i>

13:41.613 --> 13:43.948
<i>I mean, I know it was funny
how we used to not like Lexi,</i>

13:43.948 --> 13:47.035
<i>but she's been a great friend
to me while you've been gone.</i>

13:47.035 --> 13:49.079
<i>She is also the boss,
so if I were you,</i>

13:49.079 --> 13:51.289
<i>I would think about apologizing.</i>

13:51.289 --> 13:53.958
<i>Anyway, I guess
we'll talk later.</i>

13:53.958 --> 13:56.628
So, what are you
gonna do now?

14:02.592 --> 14:04.761
What...?

14:04.761 --> 14:09.391
Well, this is, um,
quite the office, Lexi.

14:09.391 --> 14:11.101
Whoa.

14:11.101 --> 14:13.937
Ah. Yes, that's the horse
that bucked me-- Todd.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.605
I keep it as a reminder
of my failures.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.899
- Wow.
- So, what can I do for you?

14:17.899 --> 14:21.403
I wanted to drop off
some apology donuts.

14:21.403 --> 14:22.904
Last night,
I wasn't at my best,

14:22.904 --> 14:24.781
and I wanted to say I'm sorry

14:24.781 --> 14:27.075
and I promise to be more
professional from now on.

14:28.535 --> 14:29.869
Did you steal these
from the break room?

14:29.869 --> 14:31.079
No. Why?

14:31.079 --> 14:32.247
Several have bites
taken out of them,

14:32.247 --> 14:34.791
and it says "break room"
on the box.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.084
Then, yes, I did.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.335
Okay. Uh, sorry.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.837
Bye.

14:38.837 --> 14:41.589
That was a pretty
half-assed apology.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.174
I mean, obviously,
you have something

14:43.174 --> 14:44.509
you'd like to say to me.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.428
So, be a reporter.

14:46.428 --> 14:47.804
Give me the full story.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.264
I don't think that's
a good idea.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.349
I have an idea.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.852
Let's take 30 seconds
and tell the other person

14:53.852 --> 14:56.938
exactly what we think of them
with no repercussions.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.606
Huh?
I'll go first.

14:58.606 --> 15:01.234
I think you are
a sloppy drunk.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.277
Oh, wow.

15:02.277 --> 15:03.361
You're just gonna
go right in there.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.405
Well, I think
your relationship

15:05.405 --> 15:07.073
with your horse
is inappropriate.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.367
I think that shirt looks like
it was bought from Wet Seal.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.827
I took the bites
out of those donuts.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.579
You still work in newspapers.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.206
You work in newspapers.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.666
I knew you didn't want me
at your birthday party,

15:16.666 --> 15:18.126
but I invited
myself anyway.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.712
I don't think you're good enough
to be friends with Sam.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.468
When Dennis asked me
to hire you, I said no.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.636
You gave up a promising career
to chase after some guy,

15:28.636 --> 15:29.804
and when it doesn't work out,

15:29.804 --> 15:31.264
I'm supposed to
pick up the pieces?

15:31.264 --> 15:34.142
I only changed my mind when Sam
told me you were in a sad spot

15:34.142 --> 15:35.935
and really needed
to catch a break.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.645
I hired you for her.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.065
But I am your boss,
and if you don't perform,

15:40.065 --> 15:41.149
you will be the first to go,

15:41.149 --> 15:42.859
and it won't matter
who you're friends with.

15:45.070 --> 15:47.113
Okay, good to know.

15:48.573 --> 15:50.450
I really don't think that's
a fun game, by the way.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.243
Oh, it's a lot better if you're
playing with your family.

15:59.668 --> 16:00.960
- Are you here?
- Yep.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.879
- Oh.
- I keep closing my eyes

16:02.879 --> 16:05.423
and hoping when I open them,
I'll be in Madrid.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.260
Oh, no.
What's with the face?

16:10.345 --> 16:11.971
For some dumb reason,

16:11.971 --> 16:13.890
I thought that I would just

16:13.890 --> 16:16.685
come back home and pick
back up where I left off,

16:16.685 --> 16:19.813
but... everything's changed

16:19.813 --> 16:22.524
and I feel really disconnected
from everyone.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.569
So, what do we do then?

16:26.569 --> 16:28.697
Just sit here
and feel sorry for you

16:28.697 --> 16:30.448
for the rest of eternity?
Hmm?

16:30.448 --> 16:32.075
Am I in Hell?

16:32.075 --> 16:34.452
- If you're with me, probably.
- Oh, my God.

16:34.452 --> 16:37.247
You know, I can't listen
to any more of your whining.

16:37.247 --> 16:38.498
I'm either gonna smother you
with that pillow

16:38.498 --> 16:39.916
or we're going out.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.918
Smother me.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.431
This is so dumb.

16:54.431 --> 16:55.932
What are we doing here?

16:55.932 --> 16:57.392
I mean, (scoffs) are we
gonna split a bruschetta?

16:58.727 --> 17:00.562
You know, you don't need
those things.

17:00.562 --> 17:03.440
I feel like everyone
is staring at me,

17:03.440 --> 17:05.442
wondering
what's wrong with me

17:05.442 --> 17:08.528
and why I'm all alone
in such a beautiful place.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.863
Let me tell you something.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.699
I was prodigy on the piano.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.910
I moved to California
in the Summer of Love,

17:15.910 --> 17:18.496
and I was gonna make
incredible music.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.540
And I ended up writing...

17:20.540 --> 17:22.417
- <i>Yummy Yum-- ♪</i>
- Oh, no singing.

17:22.417 --> 17:23.835
I know.
It's embarrassing.

17:25.128 --> 17:26.629
Because I wanted
so much more.

17:28.340 --> 17:29.924
So, I got angry,

17:29.924 --> 17:32.260
and I pushed people away.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.763
And eventually,
I climbed out of my own ass

17:34.763 --> 17:38.516
and realized that there were
people all around me

17:38.516 --> 17:40.101
living their lives...

17:41.144 --> 17:44.356
...not caring about
what life should be,

17:44.356 --> 17:46.316
but about what it is.

17:46.316 --> 17:49.486
And when I got that,
everything changed.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.781
I mean, look at that
woman over there.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.449
She's not self-conscious.

17:54.449 --> 17:57.285
Just enjoying life as
it's happening right now.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.287
- You don't have to do this.
- Do what?

17:59.287 --> 18:00.955
Ghost-of-Christmas-Future me
into thinking

18:00.955 --> 18:02.457
that if I don't
change my ways,

18:02.457 --> 18:04.501
I'm gonna end up alone
and all dressed up,

18:04.501 --> 18:06.544
wearing some ugly
turquoise necklace.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.963
Or maybe you wear it because
your husband

18:08.963 --> 18:11.841
bought it for you in Spain
for your anniversary.

18:16.388 --> 18:17.430
Is that your wife?

18:17.430 --> 18:18.848
Yes, it is.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.642
Oh, my God.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.647
I'm so sorry.

18:25.647 --> 18:28.108
I ju-- I-I just can't seem
to get out of my own way.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.150
I'm a mess.

18:29.150 --> 18:30.819
- Yeah, you are.
- Thanks.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.570
- But, you know, it's okay.
- Hmm?

18:32.570 --> 18:35.448
'Cause so was I
before I met Cricket.

18:37.283 --> 18:41.037
God, I wish I could tell her
once more how beautiful she is.

18:50.422 --> 18:51.631
Okay.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.260
Excuse me.

18:55.260 --> 18:57.429
I hope this isn't too weird,

18:57.429 --> 18:59.347
but I just thought
someone should tell you

18:59.347 --> 19:01.182
how beautiful
you look tonight.

19:01.182 --> 19:04.060
Well, isn't that a kick?

19:04.060 --> 19:05.228
Thank you.

19:05.228 --> 19:06.813
And I really love
your necklace.

19:07.939 --> 19:09.357
My husband gave it to me.

19:09.357 --> 19:13.445
It's a little gaudy,
but it makes me think of him.

19:15.030 --> 19:16.948
You know, this is-- this is
really out of character for me,

19:16.948 --> 19:18.742
but would it be
the strangest thing

19:18.742 --> 19:21.119
if I asked to join you
for a glass of wine?

19:21.119 --> 19:23.455
Only if it's tequila.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.500
I'm Nell.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.793
I'm Cricket.

19:33.715 --> 19:35.216
Come in.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.052
Hey.

19:37.052 --> 19:38.887
I got more poop bags
for Arthur's business

19:38.887 --> 19:41.973
so you're always ready.

19:41.973 --> 19:43.850
Thank you.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.393
Is there something else?

19:45.393 --> 19:48.897
Technically, it's not called
Asperger's anymore.

19:48.897 --> 19:50.940
It's called
"Autism Spectrum Disorder."

19:50.940 --> 19:52.108
It means a lot of
different things

19:52.108 --> 19:53.985
to a lot of different people,
but for me,

19:53.985 --> 19:56.821
it means I need
structure and routine.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.406
There's a right way
to do things,

19:58.406 --> 20:01.076
and there's a wrong way
to do things.

20:01.076 --> 20:02.535
And there's not much
in-between.

20:02.535 --> 20:05.538
- Like the poop bags.
- Yeah. Kinda.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.581
But I'm an
environmental lawyer,

20:06.581 --> 20:08.500
so that's just
being responsible.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.252
- The world's on fire right now.
- Right.

20:11.252 --> 20:13.296
Also...

20:13.296 --> 20:16.091
I know at times
I could be...

20:16.091 --> 20:19.260
difficult to live with.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.929
Or so I've been told.

20:23.181 --> 20:24.432
So have I.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.476
So, maybe we're a good match.

20:30.689 --> 20:31.981
Well, have a nice day.

No, I know that we're not

It's just taking a little

21:02.887 --> 21:05.015

21:22.824 --> 21:25.035
Hey!

21:25.035 --> 21:27.495
Are you ready to rock
our faces off?

21:27.495 --> 21:30.749
- Sure am.
- Come on, girl. I can tell you

21:30.749 --> 21:32.459
- about the '80s, now.
- Oh. Please.

21:34.169 --> 21:36.755
"And since,
as Monty Waxberg believed,

21:36.755 --> 21:39.341
you never really know where
life is going to take you,

21:39.341 --> 21:42.344
so just open up your heart
along the way and listen.

21:42.344 --> 21:44.888
Everyone has a story
if you just take the time

21:44.888 --> 21:47.098
to find out what it is."

21:48.600 --> 21:49.893
I would tell you
this is really good,

21:49.893 --> 21:51.394
but then you'd just want
to start a union,

21:51.394 --> 21:53.855
so instead, I'm just gonna
upload it to publication.

21:53.855 --> 21:56.149
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:57.192 --> 21:59.069
Don't let those nice words
go to your head, old man.

21:59.069 --> 22:01.237
I'm just trying to
keep this job.

22:05.408 --> 22:07.243
Didn't even say goodbye.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.328
What a jerk.

22:08.328 --> 22:10.830
Hey, I just e-mailed you
your next assignment--

22:10.830 --> 22:13.708
a woman who ran a successful
Dim Sum restaurant in Chinatown.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.627
On it.

22:18.254 --> 22:19.589
- Hi.
- Oh.

22:19.589 --> 22:21.132
I'm gonna be honest
because I'm dead.

22:21.132 --> 22:22.676
Your natural deodorant
doesn't work.

22:22.676 --> 22:24.552
And why aren't you married?

22:24.552 --> 22:26.429
Time's ticking.
