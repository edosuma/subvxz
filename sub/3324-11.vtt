WEBVTT

00:02.003 --> 00:03.584
Previously on "Teen Wolf:"

00:03.754 --> 00:05.290
That puts Matt at the scene
of three murders.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.121
We know it's Matt.
Just do what he says.

00:08.217 --> 00:09.502
What, are you gonna kill
everyone in here?

00:09.677 --> 00:11.668
That's what Jackson's tor.

00:11.888 --> 00:13.503
Your mother wrote this note.

00:13.681 --> 00:18.266
I don't know how I could sit
until someone paid for her death.

00:18.436 --> 00:20.848
What Peter managed to do
doesn't come without a price.

00:21.063 --> 00:22.473
He's gonna come at you, Derek.

00:26.819 --> 00:28.059
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

00:28.237 --> 00:30.649
I've done everything that
you've asked of me.

00:30.823 --> 00:32.063
Help your friends.

00:32.241 --> 00:34.653
Leave Matt and Jackson to me.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.339
You know when you're drowning,
you don't actually inhale

00:51.511 --> 00:53.376
until right before you black out.

00:54.096 --> 00:55.927
It's called voluntary apnea.

01:01.521 --> 01:03.637
It's like no matter how much
you're freaking out,

01:03.856 --> 01:06.768
the instinct to not let any water in is so
strong that you won't open your mouth

01:06.943 --> 01:08.854
until you feel like your head's exploding.

01:11.489 --> 01:14.697
But then when you finally do let it in,
that's when it stops hurting.

01:15.868 --> 01:17.699
It's not scary anymore.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.277
It's actually kind of peaceful.

01:22.083 --> 01:25.917
Are you saying you hope Matt felt
some peace in his last moments?

01:28.339 --> 01:29.579
I don't feel sorry for him.

01:29.924 --> 01:33.416
Can you feel sorry for the
nine-year-old Matt who drowned?

01:33.594 --> 01:35.710
Just because a bunch of dumbasses
dragged him into a pool

01:35.888 --> 01:37.674
when he couldn't swim,
doesn't really give him the right

01:37.848 --> 01:40.055
to go off killing them one by one.

01:41.352 --> 01:44.059
And by the way, my dad told me that
they found a bunch of pictures of Allison

01:44.272 --> 01:46.354
on Matt's computer.
And not just of her though.

01:46.524 --> 01:49.140
I mean, he Photoshopped himself
into these pictures.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.775
Stuff like them
holding hands and kissing.

01:51.988 --> 01:54.980
You know, like he had built
this whole fake relationship.

01:55.157 --> 01:58.194
So yeah, maybe drowning when he was
nine years old was what sent him off the rails,

01:58.369 --> 02:01.406
but the dude was definitely
riding the crazy train.

02:02.748 --> 02:06.081
One positive thing came out
of this, though.

02:06.252 --> 02:07.287
Right?

02:11.757 --> 02:12.792
Yeah.

02:14.343 --> 02:17.050
Yeah, but I still feel like
there's something wrong between us.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.471
I don't know.
It's just, like, tension when we talk.

02:20.683 --> 02:22.219
Same thing with Scott.

02:22.768 --> 02:24.929
Have you talked to him since that night?

02:25.146 --> 02:26.431
No, not really.

02:28.316 --> 02:30.432
I mean, he's got his own
problems to deal with, though.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.198
Mom.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.410
Mom, we're gonna have to talk
about this eventually.

02:58.554 --> 02:59.885
Okay.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.883
I'm going.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.509
I love you.

03:09.482 --> 03:11.689
I don't think
he's talked to Allison, either.

03:11.901 --> 03:14.734
But that might be more her choice,
you know.

03:28.167 --> 03:30.123
Her mom dying hit her pretty hard.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.622
But I guess it brought her
and her dad closer.

03:48.479 --> 03:49.468
Jackson?

03:51.982 --> 03:54.598
Jackson hasn't really been
himself lately.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.018
Actually the funny thing is,
as of right now,

03:57.196 --> 03:59.687
Lydia is the one who seems
the most normal.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.738
And what about you, Stiles?

04:01.909 --> 04:05.993
Feeling some anxiety about that
championship game tomorrow night?

04:08.165 --> 04:10.281
Why would you ask me that?

04:10.710 --> 04:11.665
Oh.

04:12.044 --> 04:14.501
Uh, no. I never actually play.

04:15.673 --> 04:18.380
But hey, since one of my teammates
is dead and another one's missing,

04:18.592 --> 04:20.048
who knows, right?

04:20.261 --> 04:21.842
You mean Isaac.

04:22.054 --> 04:24.136
One of the three runaways.

04:24.348 --> 04:27.556
You haven't heard from any of them,
have you?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.759
How come you're
not taking any notes on this?

04:30.271 --> 04:32.262
I do my notes after the session.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.062
Your memory's that good?

04:34.233 --> 04:35.894
How about we get back to you?

04:39.155 --> 04:40.361
Stiles?

04:43.826 --> 04:44.861
I'm fine.

04:46.495 --> 04:50.408
Yeah, aside from the not sleeping,
the jumpiness,

04:50.624 --> 04:53.001
the constant,
overwhelming, crushing fear

04:53.210 --> 04:55.246
that something terrible
is about to happen.

04:55.421 --> 04:57.503
It's called hyper-vigilance,

04:57.673 --> 05:01.006
the persistent feeling
of being under threat.

05:01.552 --> 05:04.089
But it's not just a feeling, though.

05:05.139 --> 05:07.255
It's like it's a panic attack.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.806
You know, like I can't even breathe.

05:10.019 --> 05:11.680
Like you're drowning?

05:13.105 --> 05:14.060
Yeah.

05:14.273 --> 05:17.265
So if you're drowning,

05:17.485 --> 05:22.730
and you're trying to keep your mouth
closed until that very last moment,

05:23.908 --> 05:26.570
what if you choose to
not open your mouth?

05:27.161 --> 05:28.742
To not let the water in?

05:29.747 --> 05:31.988
Well, you do anyway. It's a reflex.

05:32.166 --> 05:36.409
But if you hold off
until that reflex kicks in,

05:37.713 --> 05:39.123
you have more time, right?

05:39.590 --> 05:40.875
Not much time.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.503
But more time to fight your way
to the surface?

05:43.677 --> 05:44.712
I guess.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.502
More time to be rescued?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.420
More time to be in agonizing pain.

05:48.599 --> 05:51.682
And did you forget about the part where
you feel like your head's exploding?

05:51.852 --> 05:54.594
If it's about survival,

05:54.814 --> 05:57.180
isn't a little agony worth it?

05:57.608 --> 05:59.769
And what if it just gets worse?

06:01.779 --> 06:04.145
What if it's agony now, and then...

06:06.408 --> 06:08.148
Then it's just hell later on?

06:08.327 --> 06:11.694
Then think about something
Winston Churchill once said.

06:12.998 --> 06:15.330
"If you're going through hell,

06:16.210 --> 06:17.996
keep going."

06:45.906 --> 06:47.112
As you can see, Scott,

06:47.283 --> 06:50.446
there's been some interesting
developments lately.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.244
I think we should catch up.

07:37.708 --> 07:42.873
Come on, Scott, let's be realistic about
who's got the upper hand here.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.545
- Let her go.
- Can't do that.

07:45.716 --> 07:48.173
But let her live?

07:49.386 --> 07:50.842
That's up to you.

07:51.722 --> 07:54.134
- What do you want?
- lwant to talk.

07:54.350 --> 07:56.966
You haven't been
answering your phone.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.386
Let her go, and we can talk
about whatever you want.

08:02.358 --> 08:05.691
I want the same thing
that l have always wanted.

08:06.487 --> 08:09.274
I want Derek and his pack.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.692
You have them all in hiding.
How am I supposed to know where they are?

08:14.870 --> 08:16.371
I think with the proper motivation,

08:16.580 --> 08:18.195
you could draw them out.

08:18.374 --> 08:22.538
And if you hadn't noticed,
I now have a fairly impressive means

08:22.753 --> 08:25.460
by which I can motivate people.

08:27.424 --> 08:30.086
Why do you think
I'm able to control him?

08:30.302 --> 08:32.384
You know the myth, Scott.

08:32.596 --> 08:35.383
The Kanima is a weapon of vengeance.

08:36.475 --> 08:38.340
This is about Kate?

08:38.560 --> 08:42.178
l didn'tjust come here
to bury my daughter.

08:42.398 --> 08:44.559
I came to avenge her.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.487
Are you okay?

08:53.659 --> 08:55.741
I don't know what's happening.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.578
I don't know what that thing was
or even what you are,

08:59.748 --> 09:02.581
but whatever he wants,
just give it to him.

09:03.002 --> 09:03.957
Mom,

09:05.504 --> 09:06.835
it's not that easy.

09:07.506 --> 09:08.871
Do what he wants.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.132
Just give him what he wants.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.840
I don't know if I can.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.382
Derek told us
to be back before sunup.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.184
I thought I heard something.

09:23.355 --> 09:25.687
Look, if we're gonna do that whole
"I thought I heard something" thing,

09:25.858 --> 09:27.519
then we shouldn't be stopping.
We should be running.

09:27.693 --> 09:29.024
No, listen.

09:31.780 --> 09:32.940
Coyote?

09:35.868 --> 09:36.903
Wolf?

09:37.494 --> 09:40.076
No, it can't be.
There are no wolves in California.

09:40.289 --> 09:42.655
No, but there are werewolves.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.949
That didn't sound like Derek.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.296
Maybe it was.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.772
You decided.

10:15.532 --> 10:16.521
When?

10:17.659 --> 10:18.910
Tonight.

10:19.078 --> 10:20.943
Everyone's gonna be
at the game.

10:21.455 --> 10:24.538
- And we figured it was the best time.
- It's not like we want to.

10:26.877 --> 10:28.788
What do you want?

10:29.004 --> 10:32.997
Since ljust turned 16 a month ago,
I wouldn't mind getting my license.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.670
I can't do that if I'm dead, you know.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.009
Well, I told you there was a price.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.258
You didn't say it would be like this.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.343
Yeah, but I told you
how to survive.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.758
You do it as a pack.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.515
And you're not a pack
without an Alpha.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.388
We know.

10:56.782 --> 10:58.613
You wanna look for another pack?

11:01.245 --> 11:03.531
How are you even gonna find one?

11:06.416 --> 11:08.031
We think we already did.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.759
Would you mind seeing who that is?

11:34.778 --> 11:36.314
It's okay, Isaac.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.022
We're open.

11:44.997 --> 11:47.613
Like all of a sudden
we heard all this howling.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.369
It was unbelievable.

11:49.585 --> 11:51.997
- There must have been a dozen of them.
- Maybe more.

11:52.171 --> 11:54.082
Yeah, or maybe only two.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.422
You know what
the Beau Geste effect is?

11:57.593 --> 11:59.879
If they modulate their howls
with a rapid shift in tone,

12:00.095 --> 12:01.801
two wolves can sound like 20.

12:02.431 --> 12:04.387
Look, that doesn't matter, okay?

12:05.767 --> 12:08.429
There's another pack out there.
There's got to be.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.722
We've made up our minds.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.356
We lost, Derek.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.733
And it's over.

12:18.572 --> 12:19.732
We're leaving.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.150
No.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.114
No, you're running.

12:23.452 --> 12:25.659
And once you start, you don't stop.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.449
You'll always be running.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.683
I expected a slightly warmer welcome.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.476
But...

12:53.899 --> 12:55.309
point taken.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.275
Why does it smell like that?

13:05.827 --> 13:06.816
What?

13:06.995 --> 13:10.533
Scott said almost the same thing to me
a few months ago.

13:11.208 --> 13:13.745
One day he could somehow tell
the difference

13:13.919 --> 13:17.127
between which animals were
getting better and which...

13:18.423 --> 13:19.754
were not.

13:22.511 --> 13:24.297
He's not getting better, is he?

13:30.852 --> 13:32.353
Is it cancer?

13:33.272 --> 13:34.557
Osteosarcoma.

13:34.773 --> 13:37.606
It has a very distinct scent, doesn't it?

13:39.111 --> 13:40.271
Come here.

13:45.951 --> 13:49.068
I know you're well aware of what
your new abilities can do for you.

13:49.788 --> 13:52.780
Improved strength,
speed, and healing.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.659
You ever wonder
what it could do for others?

14:03.760 --> 14:05.216
Give me your hand.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.803
Go on.

14:36.585 --> 14:37.995
What did I do?

14:39.129 --> 14:41.461
You took some of his pain away.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.625
Only a little bit.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.257
But sometimes a little
can make quite a difference.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.799
It's okay.

14:51.266 --> 14:53.302
First time he showed me, I cried, too.

15:02.694 --> 15:05.071
Quite a situation
you've got yourself in here, Derek.

15:05.489 --> 15:07.354
I mean, I'm out of commission
for a few weeks

15:07.532 --> 15:10.365
and suddenly, there's lizard people,
geriatric psychopaths,

15:10.577 --> 15:14.411
and you're cooking up werewolves out of every
self-esteem-deprived adolescent in town.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.499
What do you want?

15:16.708 --> 15:18.744
Well, I want to help.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.920
You're my nephew.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.212
The only relative that I have left.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.756
You know, there's still a lot
that I can teach you.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.631
Can we just talk?

15:33.141 --> 15:35.132
Sure. Let's talk.

15:39.815 --> 15:42.648
They're leaving tonight,
during the game.

15:44.653 --> 15:46.609
So, why are you telling me?

15:46.780 --> 15:49.066
I'm not telling you.
I'm asking you.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.068
I'm asking for your advice.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.449
From me? Why?

15:54.413 --> 15:55.778
Because I trust you.

15:57.541 --> 15:58.496
Why?

15:58.667 --> 16:01.784
Because you always seem to
want to do the right thing.

16:02.003 --> 16:05.131
I usually have no idea what I'm doing.

16:07.092 --> 16:09.128
Actually, I always have no idea
what I'm doing.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.002
Do you want to let me know
what you're doing right now?

16:13.932 --> 16:16.298
I'm not going anywhere,
if that's what you mean.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.854
l have too many people here
who need me.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.222
Well, I guess
that makes me lucky 'cause...

16:25.402 --> 16:28.064
'Cause I don't have anyone, so...

16:30.073 --> 16:32.234
Are you gonna go with them?

16:32.451 --> 16:33.691
Yeah.

16:33.869 --> 16:35.484
Yeah, I think I will.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.993
- Good luck with the game, though.
- Well, thanks, but I'm not going either.

16:40.208 --> 16:44.247
Can't even think about playing
some meaningless game right now.

16:45.088 --> 16:46.999
You weren't at practice last week,
were you?

16:47.382 --> 16:49.247
No, I skipped it. Why?

16:49.801 --> 16:51.132
And you didn't hear?

16:52.596 --> 16:54.928
- Hear what?
- Jackson was there.

16:56.391 --> 16:59.929
- What do you mean "there"? Like, he was...
- As if nothing had happened.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.560
Wait. That means...

17:02.731 --> 17:04.346
- The game tonight?
- Yeah.

17:05.734 --> 17:07.395
He's playing.

17:16.870 --> 17:17.825
Whoo!

17:17.996 --> 17:19.577
Yeah, go Cyclones!

17:22.626 --> 17:24.162
You okay, dude?

17:25.045 --> 17:26.410
I'm perfect.

17:27.255 --> 17:30.167
Well, we all know that,
but are you okay?

17:31.426 --> 17:33.838
You didn't answer my texts all week.

17:34.429 --> 17:36.260
I'm getting worried about you.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.005
Jackson.

17:38.642 --> 17:39.848
Jackson!

17:40.310 --> 17:42.096
Wow! Let's go!

17:49.903 --> 17:52.360
Stay in the goal tonight, Danny.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.073
Do not come out.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.238
And if you see me coming towards you,

17:57.744 --> 18:02.204
run the other way as fast as you can.

18:20.350 --> 18:21.715
Good morning.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.722
In less than an hour,
aircraft from here

18:24.938 --> 18:27.179
will be joining others
from around the world.

18:27.399 --> 18:31.938
And you will be launching the largest
aerial battle in the history of mankind.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.601
What?

18:33.822 --> 18:38.065
Mankind. That word should
have new meaning for all of us today.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.906
- What the hell is he talking about?
- He does this every year.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.237
-Seﬁoudy?
-Yeah.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.198
- We are fighting for our right to live.
- Yeah!

18:46.793 --> 18:48.249
Wait, is this...

18:48.420 --> 18:51.332
Yeah, it's the speech from
"Independence Day".

18:52.048 --> 18:56.087
But as the day the world declared
in one voice...

18:56.261 --> 18:57.751
It's coach's favorite movie.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.723
We will not go quietly into the night!

19:00.890 --> 19:03.677
- He doesn't know any sports speeches?
- I don't think he cares.

19:03.852 --> 19:08.346
Today we celebrate
our independence day!

19:08.565 --> 19:10.226
Yeah!

19:11.610 --> 19:13.396
Well spoken, coach.

19:13.862 --> 19:16.820
I might have chosen something
with a little more historical value,

19:16.990 --> 19:19.197
but there's no denying your passion.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.278
And while I haven't been here long,

19:21.453 --> 19:25.617
there's no denying my pride in having
a winning team for this school.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.073
I know you'll all be brilliant tonight,

19:28.251 --> 19:31.994
even with only one co-captain
leading you.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.789
Now, I'm your principal,
but I'm also a fan.

19:35.967 --> 19:40.461
So don't think I'll be content
to watch you merely beat this team.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.591
Get out there and murder them.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.761
You heard the man.

19:46.561 --> 19:48.552
Asses on the field!

19:48.730 --> 19:49.845
Yeah!

19:50.023 --> 19:52.309
Coach, are you benching me?

19:52.525 --> 19:54.937
- It's not my decision.
- But I have to play.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.898
McCall, you're failing three classes.
Academics come first.

19:58.073 --> 19:59.904
Coach, you don't get it.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.777
You have to let me play.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.154
McCall, no. Not tonight.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.578
Tonight, you're on the bench.

20:20.553 --> 20:24.967
You don't actually think that I want
to be the Alpha again, do you?

20:25.183 --> 20:28.641
That wasn't my finest performance,
considering it ended in my death.

20:28.812 --> 20:30.677
I mean, I'm usually more...
Okay, go ahead! Come on, do it.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.436
Hit me, hit me.

20:33.483 --> 20:36.065
I can see that it's cathartic for you.

20:36.528 --> 20:39.019
You're letting go of all the anger,
self-loathing, and hatred

20:39.239 --> 20:41.946
that comes with total
and complete failure.

20:42.617 --> 20:44.448
I may be the one
taking the beating, Derek,

20:44.619 --> 20:46.655
but you've already been beaten.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.950
So, go ahead.

20:49.165 --> 20:52.248
Hit me if it'll
make you feel better.

20:53.795 --> 20:56.707
After all, I did say
that I wanted to help.

20:59.968 --> 21:01.583
You can't help me.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.303
- Your dad coming?
- Yeah, he's already here.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.061
- You seen Allison?
- No, you seen Lydia?

21:14.274 --> 21:15.514
Not yet.

21:15.734 --> 21:17.565
You know what's going on?

21:18.278 --> 21:19.518
Not yet.

21:20.238 --> 21:22.900
Yeah.
It's going to be bad, isn't it?

21:24.117 --> 21:25.982
I mean, like people screaming,
running for their lives,

21:26.161 --> 21:28.698
blood, killing,
maiming kind of bad?

21:32.751 --> 21:34.116
Looks like it.

21:37.922 --> 21:38.877
Scott,

21:40.633 --> 21:43.670
the other night seeing my dad
get hit over the head by Matt,

21:43.845 --> 21:47.804
you know, while I'm just lying there
and I can't even move, itjust...

21:50.310 --> 21:52.301
I want to help, you know,

21:53.646 --> 21:56.558
but I can't do the things
that you can do.

21:58.401 --> 21:59.516
I can't...

22:01.905 --> 22:03.270
It's okay.

22:05.408 --> 22:06.693
We're losing, dude.

22:06.868 --> 22:09.450
What the hell are you talking about?
The game hasn't even started.

22:09.621 --> 22:11.703
Now put on your helmet and get
out there. You're in for Greenberg.

22:11.873 --> 22:15.491
- What? What happened to Greenberg?
- What happened to Greenberg? He sucks.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.920
You suck slightly less.

22:19.547 --> 22:22.163
I'm playing? On the field?

22:22.675 --> 22:24.051
With the team?

22:24.260 --> 22:27.627
Yes, unless you'd rather
play with yourself.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.929
I already did that today, twice.

22:30.308 --> 22:32.424
- Get the hell out there!
- All right.

22:36.314 --> 22:38.771
Oh, no. Why is my son
running on the field?

22:40.318 --> 22:42.650
Because he's on the team?

22:45.156 --> 22:46.532
He is.

22:47.575 --> 22:49.691
He's on the team.
He's on the field.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.780
My son is on the field!

22:57.627 --> 22:59.083
Oh, dear God.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.881
Scott. Can you hear me?

23:05.802 --> 23:07.963
Ah, you can. Good.

23:09.180 --> 23:13.514
Then listen closely because
the game is about to get interesting.

23:33.329 --> 23:34.614
Play it again.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.766
Let's put a real clock
on this game, Scott.

24:01.858 --> 24:04.725
I'll give you
until the last 30 seconds.

24:04.903 --> 24:08.521
When that scoreboard clock
begins counting down from 30,

24:08.698 --> 24:12.782
if you haven't given me Derek,
then Jackson is gonna kill someone.

24:16.581 --> 24:19.618
So tell me, Scott,
who's gonna die tonight?

24:19.876 --> 24:23.960
Should it be your mother,
who so bravely came out to support you?

24:24.172 --> 24:25.582
Or the sheriff,

24:26.215 --> 24:27.876
your best friend's father?

24:29.636 --> 24:31.797
Or how about
the pretty little redhead

24:32.013 --> 24:34.880
who managed to survive
the bite of an Alpha?

24:36.517 --> 24:38.599
Or maybe one of these
innocent teenagers

24:38.770 --> 24:41.227
with their whole life ahead of them?

24:41.439 --> 24:42.679
Oh, God.

24:45.234 --> 24:49.273
Or should I do everyone a favor
and kill that ridiculous coach?

24:50.865 --> 24:51.980
It's up to you, Scott.

24:52.158 --> 24:56.572
But you are going to help me
take Derek down.

24:57.956 --> 24:59.537
Because if you don't...

25:01.417 --> 25:05.456
I'll have Jackson rip someone's head off
right in the middle of the field

25:05.672 --> 25:10.166
and drench everyone you love
and care about in blood.

25:14.722 --> 25:15.928
See?

25:16.099 --> 25:18.010
Prime example right here.

25:18.226 --> 25:20.137
I'm not healing as fast.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.810
Coming back from the dead
isn't easy, you know.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.308
I'm not as strong as I used to be.

25:26.067 --> 25:27.898
I need a pack.

25:28.111 --> 25:30.193
An Alpha like you.

25:31.447 --> 25:33.403
I need you as much as you need me.

25:36.577 --> 25:39.410
Why would I want help
from a total psycho?

25:39.622 --> 25:41.908
First of all, I'm not a total psycho.

25:42.125 --> 25:45.083
And by the way, you're the one
that slashed my throat wide open.

25:45.294 --> 25:48.161
But we're all works in progress,
right? So...

25:49.549 --> 25:51.255
We need each other.

25:51.467 --> 25:55.380
Sometimes when you need help,
you turn to people you'd never expect.

26:04.105 --> 26:06.141
He's probably just warming up.

26:06.399 --> 26:09.186
Ooh, I got it, I got it.

26:12.697 --> 26:14.312
Oh, he's just a little nervous.

26:14.490 --> 26:16.230
Plenty of time to turn it around.

26:18.536 --> 26:19.571
Ow.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.584
- Sit down, McCall.
- But, coach, we're dying out there.

26:32.759 --> 26:35.466
I'm aware of that. Now sit.

26:42.602 --> 26:44.092
You came to help.

26:45.855 --> 26:47.311
I came to win.

26:56.866 --> 26:57.981
Come on!

26:58.618 --> 26:59.653
Run!

27:00.286 --> 27:01.787
- Come on!
- Run!

27:24.560 --> 27:25.891
- Run!
- Come on!

27:38.825 --> 27:39.780
Allison, wait.

27:40.118 --> 27:41.073
No!

27:41.285 --> 27:42.491
No, no, run.

27:43.412 --> 27:44.447
Go.

27:44.622 --> 27:45.862
Go!

28:15.236 --> 28:16.476
You got a plan yet?

28:16.696 --> 28:21.190
No, right now it's pretty much just
keep Jackson from killing anyone.

28:21.409 --> 28:24.276
Well, that might be easier
if you're actually in the game.

28:24.495 --> 28:27.453
We have to make it so coach has
no choice but to play you.

28:27.623 --> 28:28.703
How do we do that?

28:28.875 --> 28:32.038
He's got a bench full of guys he can use
before he ever puts me on the field.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.177
Can you do it without putting anyone
in the hospital?

28:42.138 --> 28:43.503
I can try.

29:02.575 --> 29:03.530
La hey!

29:05.912 --> 29:07.152
Ramirez!

29:08.164 --> 29:09.529
You're in.

29:19.050 --> 29:20.335
Murphy!

29:21.052 --> 29:22.337
You're in.

29:32.063 --> 29:33.269
La hey!

29:33.439 --> 29:36.556
Seriously, what the hell
is your problem?

30:11.185 --> 30:12.300
Stop!

30:27.493 --> 30:29.484
It's not broken.
But I can't move it.

30:31.289 --> 30:34.372
I think Jackson nicked me
'cause I can feel it spreading.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.287
You want to play chess, Scott?

30:37.461 --> 30:40.794
Then you better be willing to
sacrifice your own pawns.

30:41.382 --> 30:42.747
One, two, three.

30:42.925 --> 30:44.631
Crap. McCall.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.429
Either you're in or we forfeit.

30:48.139 --> 30:49.094
Okay.

30:50.433 --> 30:53.641
Something's happening, isn't it?
Something more than a lacrosse game?

30:53.853 --> 30:56.765
- You should go.
- Oh, I'm not going anywhere.

30:56.981 --> 30:59.768
But everything that I said before,
forget it. All of it. Okay?

30:59.984 --> 31:02.396
If you can do something to help,
then you do it.

31:02.611 --> 31:03.987
You have to.

31:05.072 --> 31:06.152
I will.

31:11.996 --> 31:13.031
Stop!

31:13.789 --> 31:15.290
Please, Allison, stop!

31:57.708 --> 32:00.950
Don't you know
what you're really bargaining for, Scott?

32:01.670 --> 32:05.663
Haven't you guessed what
the real offer on the table is?

32:06.300 --> 32:07.801
It's Allison.

32:08.010 --> 32:09.796
It's always been Allison.

32:11.222 --> 32:15.431
You give me Derek,
and I'll let you have Allison.

32:20.981 --> 32:23.063
YOU owe me CI new bOW.

32:23.984 --> 32:25.895
You owe me an explanation.

32:26.946 --> 32:29.938
For what? I caught them.

32:30.157 --> 32:31.533
Me.

32:31.742 --> 32:35.155
"Caught" came very close to kill.
And that's not the way we do this.

32:35.329 --> 32:37.615
Maybe it's not the way you do it.

32:37.790 --> 32:40.327
I think my way
worked out pretty well.

32:41.085 --> 32:42.325
Allison.

32:43.421 --> 32:45.912
Hey, Grandpa, it's me.
We got our two runaways.

32:46.090 --> 32:47.580
Call us back.

32:51.345 --> 32:52.425
What?

32:54.223 --> 32:56.885
It's just the first time
I've heard you call him that.

33:05.192 --> 33:07.353
It was a good effort, Isaac.

33:07.570 --> 33:08.810
It was.

33:12.825 --> 33:17.660
This would be so much more poetic
if it were halftime.

33:23.169 --> 33:25.034
You tried to build your pack.

33:25.254 --> 33:27.119
You tried to prepare for the worst.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.125
You weren't ready.

33:29.341 --> 33:32.003
Because of it, Gerard is winning.

33:33.095 --> 33:35.177
He's taking his time.
He's toying with Scott.

33:35.389 --> 33:38.426
He's going after your wolves,
one by one.

33:38.642 --> 33:40.178
He's relishing in his victory.

33:40.394 --> 33:42.851
How about you tell me something
I don't know?

33:43.063 --> 33:44.519
Oh, I'm going to.

33:44.732 --> 33:47.599
And it's gonna prove why you
should trust me.

33:48.486 --> 33:50.522
Why you need to trust me.

33:50.738 --> 33:52.945
Because I'm going to tell you
how to stop Jackson.

33:53.157 --> 33:55.944
What do you mean?
How to kill him?

33:58.329 --> 34:00.365
Actually, how to save him.

34:21.852 --> 34:23.058
McCall!

34:23.687 --> 34:25.268
Where's McCall?

34:34.240 --> 34:36.071
Where is it?
Where's the ball?

34:36.283 --> 34:38.569
Hey, who's got the ball?
Where did it go?

34:40.412 --> 34:41.538
Oh, oh, oh.

34:47.503 --> 34:48.367
Oh, crap.

34:51.924 --> 34:53.084
Stilinski!

34:54.051 --> 34:56.667
Shoot it. Shoot the ball!

34:57.763 --> 34:58.878
Shoot it, you idiot!

34:59.056 --> 34:59.886
Shoot it!

35:06.438 --> 35:07.393
Yeah!

35:07.606 --> 35:09.107
- Yes!
- Whoo-hoo!

35:09.275 --> 35:10.435
I scored a goal?

35:11.694 --> 35:13.434
I scored a goal!

35:13.612 --> 35:15.694
I scored a goal!

35:20.786 --> 35:22.242
Where is he?

35:30.254 --> 35:31.334
Yeah!

35:39.888 --> 35:42.630
Yes! Yes! Whoo!

35:43.225 --> 35:46.058
There's a myth that you
can cure a werewolf

35:46.270 --> 35:48.226
simply by calling out
its Christian name.

35:48.397 --> 35:49.512
It's just a myth.

35:49.732 --> 35:52.849
Sometimes myths and legends
bear a hint of truth.

35:53.611 --> 35:57.695
Our name is a symbol of who we are.
But the Kanima has no identity.

35:58.407 --> 36:00.443
That's why it doesn't seek a pack.

36:00.618 --> 36:01.733
It seeks a master.

36:01.910 --> 36:04.401
And who else grows up with no pack?

36:05.122 --> 36:06.532
No identity?

36:06.707 --> 36:09.323
- An orphan.
- Like Jackson.

36:09.543 --> 36:11.408
And right now,
his identity is disappearing

36:11.587 --> 36:13.498
beneath the reptilian skin
and you need to bring him back.

36:13.672 --> 36:16.584
- How?
- Through his heart. How else?

36:16.800 --> 36:18.256
You know,
in case you hadn't noticed,

36:18.427 --> 36:21.919
Jackson doesn't really have
too much of a heart to begin with.

36:22.264 --> 36:23.720
Not true.

36:24.224 --> 36:26.886
He'd never admit it,
but there is one person.

36:27.061 --> 36:30.519
One young lady with whom Jackson
shared a real bond.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.601
One person who can reach him.

36:34.526 --> 36:35.777
Who can save him.

36:38.697 --> 36:39.652
Lydia.

36:48.374 --> 36:49.784
Yeah!

36:51.126 --> 36:52.241
Yes!

36:54.296 --> 36:55.331
Whoo!

36:56.173 --> 37:00.257
Your best ally has always been anger,
Derek, but what you lack most is heart.

37:00.427 --> 37:04.261
That's why you've always known that
you need Scott more than anyone.

37:04.431 --> 37:07.468
And even somebody as burned
and dead on the inside as me

37:07.643 --> 37:12.228
knows better than to underestimate
the simple yet undeniable power

37:12.439 --> 37:14.100
of human love.

38:24.386 --> 38:26.547
We did it. We won!

38:28.140 --> 38:29.095
Yes!

38:29.641 --> 38:31.723
Yeah! Yes!

38:32.561 --> 38:34.426
Nothing happened. Nothing.

39:03.008 --> 39:04.123
Scott!

39:04.968 --> 39:06.799
Scott, where are you?

39:11.934 --> 39:14.516
- Scott!
- Mom. Are you okay?

39:14.728 --> 39:16.343
Yeah, I'm fine.
But somebody is hurt.

39:16.522 --> 39:18.478
- Somebody is down on the field.
- What?

39:18.649 --> 39:19.729
He's not moving!

39:22.569 --> 39:25.276
Get out of the way!
Move! Back off!

39:29.451 --> 39:30.861
Move. Move.

39:33.580 --> 39:34.786
Jackson?

39:35.541 --> 39:37.532
What's happened to Jackson?
Jackson!

39:37.709 --> 39:40.121
Jackson!
Jackson, what's happening?

39:40.337 --> 39:42.077
Can we get a medic over here?

39:42.256 --> 39:43.837
We're gonna need a medic!

39:48.720 --> 39:50.631
He's not breathing. No pulse.

39:50.806 --> 39:52.797
- Nothing? Oh!
- Nothing. Oh!

39:53.016 --> 39:54.677
Oh, my God. There's blood.

39:54.852 --> 39:55.887
There's blood.

39:56.395 --> 39:57.350
Look.

39:59.648 --> 40:01.388
He did it to himself?

40:02.734 --> 40:04.235
Get down here.

40:04.444 --> 40:07.686
Get down here and hold his head.
Tilt it up.

40:21.837 --> 40:23.577
Where's Stiles?
Where's my son?

40:23.797 --> 40:24.912
Where...

40:25.966 --> 40:27.456
Where's my son?

40:28.594 --> 40:30.505
Where's Stiles?
Where's Stiles?

40:30.762 --> 40:32.844
Where the hell is my son?
