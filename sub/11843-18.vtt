- <i>She's a stranger, Isabel.</i>

00:07.907 --> 00:10.342
- I saw Topolsky last night.
- There's a hunter.

00:10.410 --> 00:13.004
An alien hunter.

00:13.079 --> 00:17.243
- He's buried deep inside the F.B.l.
- What's he looking for?

00:17.317 --> 00:20.548
It's a communicator,
and there's another onejust like it.

00:20.620 --> 00:23.317
I took it from the special unit
evidence vault back in Washington.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.381
I know they only work
when they're together.

00:25.458 --> 00:29.918

- No one can know we have that!

00:29.996 --> 00:34.263
- Dr. Margoiin is a psychiatric specialist.
- She had a breakdown.

01:51.710 --> 01:54.077
- He's got the orb.
- Which proves nothing.

- If you hadn't taken it out of the apartment-
- It's always my fault.

01:57.316 --> 01:59.751
Blaming each other

Valenti now has something
from our planet in his possession.

- We don't even know what it is.

05:53.952 --> 05:55.886
Hmm. He's sweet.

05:55.954 --> 05:58.980
Sweet as in nice guy, or sweet
as in potential love connection?

05:59.057 --> 06:01.719
Sweet as in I don't know.

06:01.793 --> 06:04.455
What about you?
You've been here a couple of weeks.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.625
- You must have somebody in your radar.
- Still soaking it all in.

Although I have to admit, I'm a little
bummed your brother's unavailable.

06:11.370 --> 06:14.533
I'm sort of into
those serious, wounded guys.

06:14.606 --> 06:17.303
Well, you can forget it.
He's a total goner.

06:17.376 --> 06:20.038
You should hear him talk about-
“Liz is my soul mate.

06:20.112 --> 06:23.377
I never felt like this before.“
It's enough to make you want to gag.

06:23.448 --> 06:27.009
- That's weird. I... thought I felt him-
- What?

06:27.085 --> 06:29.918
Nothing.
I'm sure it was nothing.

06:29.988 --> 06:31.922

I'm sorry, Sheriff...

11:01.393 --> 11:04.522
but I'm afraid Kathleen Topolsky
was one of the victims of the fire.

11:07.666 --> 11:11.694
Doctor, has anything happened
since our meeting last week...

11:11.770 --> 11:14.967

might have been set to do her harm?

11:15.040 --> 11:18.442
- Our meeting? - Here in Roswell.
You came looking for Miss Topolsky.

11:18.510 --> 11:20.808

What do you mean?

11:50.642 --> 11:52.906
Not having anyone to talk to.

Something tearing you up inside,

Is that what you need to do, Sheriff?

12:09.728 --> 12:12.095

right there in front of us. Who was he?

And how the hell did he look like
a doctor who was 3,000 miles away?

12:46.464 --> 12:49.923
There's a crazy thing my father used to
talk about called a shape-shifter.

the form of another person.

12:52.037 --> 12:55.530
- There's no such thing as a shape-shifter.
- What if there is, Max?

12:55.607 --> 12:58.235

told us was true?
