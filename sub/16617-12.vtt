00:01.101 --> 00:02.935
<i>You're watching</i>
The Last Man on Earth.

00:02.937 --> 00:04.436
Yes!

00:04.438 --> 00:05.971
<i>Catch all-new episodes Sundays.</i>

00:05.973 --> 00:08.140
<i>And check out</i>
<i>our other Fox programs,</i>

00:08.142 --> 00:09.708
Bob's Burgers--
Whoo!

00:09.710 --> 00:11.977
Brooklyn Nine-Nine
<i>and</i> Family Guy.

00:11.979 --> 00:14.546
-Can me and Ramon
go ride shirtless bikes?
-(sighs)

00:14.548 --> 00:15.748
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:16.950 --> 00:19.318
<i>Previously on</i>
The Last Man on Earth...

00:19.320 --> 00:20.853
This is for her own safety.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.121
We don't know what we're doing.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.355
We're not doctors.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.823
Has anybody seen my mom?

00:24.825 --> 00:26.458
Come find me!

00:26.460 --> 00:27.726
(bullet ricochets)
(Gail groans)

00:27.728 --> 00:29.628
I've only flown
in a simulator.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.030
You got to take
that leap one day.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.231
LEWIS:
<i>Okay, I'm gonna do it.</i>

00:32.233 --> 00:34.800
(all cheering)
(Carol screams)

00:34.802 --> 00:37.169
TANDY:<i> I created something</i>
<i>to honor Lewis</i>

00:37.171 --> 00:38.904
and help us see the light.

00:53.019 --> 00:55.087
(light groan)

01:14.674 --> 01:17.576
Hey, look who's back.
(chuckles)

01:17.578 --> 01:19.378
Went pretty hard
up in Napa, huh?

01:19.380 --> 01:20.879
Looks like someone
needs a vacation

01:20.881 --> 01:22.614
after a vacation,
am I right?

01:22.616 --> 01:24.283
JK, you look great.

01:24.285 --> 01:26.985
Everyone's in the common room.
I'll be right up.

01:31.357 --> 01:33.392
Oh, good God, Gail!

01:33.394 --> 01:34.626
(shouts)

01:34.628 --> 01:36.462
I told you she wasn't
the "D" word.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.697
You're back! Hi.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.966
Oh, Gail. Ugh,
you smell like

01:40.968 --> 01:43.068
the inside of an
unwashed sock puppet.

01:43.070 --> 01:45.804
Must have been
quite the bender, huh?

01:45.806 --> 01:47.306
CAROL: Looks like you got
some wine on your leg there.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.942
Someone needs to go back
to drinking school.

01:49.944 --> 01:52.444
It's supposed to go
in your mouth, Gail.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.545
Look what the cat dragged in.

01:53.547 --> 01:54.947
Nice of you
to finally join us, Gail.

01:54.949 --> 01:56.582
This whole place
has fallen apart.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.450
You decide to go party down
on your own.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.252
Ridiculous.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.753
Hey, I think she's trying
to say something.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.455
Wa...

02:04.991 --> 02:06.558
(shouts)
Oh, geez.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.593
Gail?

02:07.595 --> 02:10.696
Wine. She needs wine!

02:14.167 --> 02:15.801
ERICA: Maybe we should
elevate her head.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.636
No, no, we need
to leave her neck unkinked

02:17.638 --> 02:19.004
for maximum air flow.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.572
Okay, here, Gail.
This should help.

02:20.574 --> 02:23.442
Here we go.
Yes.

02:23.444 --> 02:25.477
Oh, what did you give her?

02:25.479 --> 02:26.445
It's a Sex on the Beach.

02:26.447 --> 02:27.980
Here, force it down.
Hair of the dog.

02:27.982 --> 02:30.816
Hair of the dog.
I'm not hungover, you idiot.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.751
I have been trapped

02:32.753 --> 02:35.521
in an elevator and
I've got a friggin'...

02:35.523 --> 02:37.156
bullet hole in my leg.

02:37.158 --> 02:38.190
Whoa. Wait, who shot you?

02:38.192 --> 02:39.191
CAROL: Whoa.
ERICA: What?

02:39.193 --> 02:40.926
I did.

02:40.928 --> 02:44.863
It's always the person
you least expect.

02:44.865 --> 02:48.200
I was just...
trying to get some alone time.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.002
Because I bugged you so much?

02:50.004 --> 02:51.303
(sighs)
No, no.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.371
Well, yes,

02:52.373 --> 02:53.705
but no.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.274
I just needed some space,

02:55.276 --> 02:58.043
and so I was heading up
to the roof next door

02:58.045 --> 03:01.046
when I got trapped because
the damn power went out.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.881
I was in there for, like,

03:02.883 --> 03:04.650
ten days.
Oh.

03:04.652 --> 03:05.817
And I kept

03:05.819 --> 03:09.354
shooting off bullets,
but I guess nobody heard me.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.355
And then

03:10.357 --> 03:12.724
I got zipped by a ricochet
and I just...

03:12.726 --> 03:14.159
Mm.

03:14.161 --> 03:15.994
...I started fading.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.330
I said a prayer, and, um,

03:18.332 --> 03:23.001
loaded up my last bullet
and thought that was it.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.303
God, Gail, that's awful.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.737
Ten days?

03:25.739 --> 03:28.707
What did you do for your...
you know...

03:28.709 --> 03:30.475
private business?

03:30.477 --> 03:31.476
Tandy.
Tandy.

03:31.478 --> 03:33.045
What? It's a valid question.
It's...

03:33.047 --> 03:34.046
Mini fridge.

03:34.048 --> 03:37.749
Ew.
Go on.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.919
It really was hell on Earth.

03:40.921 --> 03:44.523
I just... thought for sure
I was gonna die in there.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.191
And then...

03:46.193 --> 03:49.595
by the grace of God,
the power came back on.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.396
Oh, uh, that was me... and God.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.764
You know, uh,
God working through me.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.934
Standard, uh, vessel situation,
you know, but, uh, bottom line,

03:55.936 --> 03:58.870
yes, I, uh, turned
the power back on. Yeah.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.239
Oh, my God.

04:00.241 --> 04:03.508
I thought I was never gonna see
your idiot face again.

04:03.510 --> 04:06.545
Get in here, you dumb turd.

04:06.547 --> 04:09.081
One dumb turd coming in hot.
(laughs)

04:09.083 --> 04:11.950
Come on.
Oh, get in here, all y'all.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.119
Oh.
Gail.
Oh, my God.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.288
Hey.
We're so glad
you're back.

04:16.290 --> 04:19.091
Thank you, and
where's the others?

04:19.093 --> 04:20.692
Where's Lewis?

04:21.794 --> 04:23.795
(whispering):
I'll take this.

04:23.797 --> 04:28.400
Gail, uh... got something
we have to tell you about Lewis.

04:28.402 --> 04:32.271
(inhales deeply)
Lewis, uh...

04:32.273 --> 04:33.972
is great.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.241
He just got
into CrossFit and P90X.

04:36.243 --> 04:37.643
Uh, he's super into
muscle confusion.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.878
H-He's not confused
about it or f...

04:39.880 --> 04:42.547
he's just focused and-and vital

04:42.549 --> 04:43.949
and feeling...
How'd he die?

04:43.951 --> 04:45.484
Peacefully.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.819
Minor plane crash.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.855
And how about Melissa?

04:51.758 --> 04:54.626
So, you just locked her up
in there?

04:54.628 --> 04:56.962
We had no other choice.
She was a danger to herself.

04:56.964 --> 05:01.166
Well, I know exactly
what she's going through.

05:01.168 --> 05:04.469
Trapped in a box. Poor thing.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.938
You know what, Gail,
you need your rest.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.641
Why don't we roll you into an
elevator and get you upstairs?

05:09.643 --> 05:11.810
Uh, I am not getting
in no damn elevator.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.979
Oh, 'cause you just
got stuck in one?

05:13.981 --> 05:15.013
TANDY:
Gail, you know,

05:15.015 --> 05:16.014
we live on this floor.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.282
Wh-Why don't you
come stay with us

05:17.284 --> 05:18.283
until you feel better?

05:18.285 --> 05:19.418
Oh, it might be nice

05:19.420 --> 05:21.353
to have someone
look after me for a while.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.688
So, thanks.

05:22.690 --> 05:23.755
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.590
Let me get you here.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.331
CAROL:
Okay, take your time.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.499
(grunts)
Okay.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.201
There you go.

05:36.203 --> 05:37.803
GAIL:
What's all this?

05:37.805 --> 05:39.671
Oh, oh, that's nothing.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.540
Let me just get that
stuff out of your way.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.708
Ah.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.310
You gave me the friggin'
googly-eye treatment.

05:45.312 --> 05:48.647
I was angry at the time.
I'm sorry.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.816
I deserved it.

05:50.818 --> 05:51.983
No, you didn't.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.186
I mean, to have
no control over your pupils

05:54.188 --> 05:55.520
like a substitute teacher?

05:55.522 --> 05:57.789
No one deserves that,
not even a picture.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.792
Carol... it's fine. Relax.

06:00.794 --> 06:04.496
(laughing):
Oh. Relax. I'm way ahead of you.

06:04.498 --> 06:07.199
That's my whole thing now,

06:07.201 --> 06:10.001
is just relaxing
during situations.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.870
I mean, so much
has changed

06:11.872 --> 06:14.706
since I drove you away,
and I'm not just talking

06:14.708 --> 06:16.942
about the amount of human waste
in your mini fridge.

06:18.010 --> 06:19.745
I've mellowed out now. Mm-hmm.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.246
Oh, yeah, now they call me

06:21.248 --> 06:26.251
the Mellow Submarine
or John Cougar Mellow-camp,

06:26.253 --> 06:29.755
and Old Meller, and, hey, it's
Henry Wadsworth Long-Mellow.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.590
Carol, I get it.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.258
I'm mellow.
Yeah.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.394
You sure you're okay
with me taking your bed?

06:35.396 --> 06:36.395
Oh, absolutely.

06:36.397 --> 06:37.929
Tandy and I'll make do,

06:37.931 --> 06:40.198
and I'll just be outside

06:40.200 --> 06:44.002
relaxing during situations.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.238
(chuckles)

06:46.240 --> 06:48.974
Mellow-nor Roosevelt out.

06:52.211 --> 06:56.348
Nobody comes into my house and
tries to take over my hallway.

07:02.622 --> 07:04.623
Damn it. Split.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.793
Tandy. Tandy.
I figured it out, man.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.294
Oh, great, bud. What is it?

07:09.296 --> 07:10.429
We're going to Akron.

07:10.431 --> 07:12.397
Perfect. Let's do it.
Yeah.

07:12.399 --> 07:15.133
Oh, uh, uh, uh, and why
are we going to A-Akron?

07:15.135 --> 07:16.468
'Cause that's
where Melissa's from.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.236
Of course. Let's go.
Let's go.
Yeah.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.304
(stammers)

07:19.306 --> 07:21.306
Uh, but what-what
does that matter?

07:21.308 --> 07:22.641
Well, 'cause last night
I couldn't stop thinking

07:22.643 --> 07:24.910
about what Gail said
about being trapped in that box.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.244
Hell on Earth, she called it.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.313
Well, Melissa's trapped
in a box, too, man.

07:28.315 --> 07:29.648
Well, yeah,
I mean she's only trapped

07:29.650 --> 07:31.383
in a sense that she can't leave
whenever she wants.

07:31.385 --> 07:33.652
Like, you know, the traditional
sense of the word "trapped."

07:33.654 --> 07:35.120
Yeah, you got a point.
Yeah, and

07:35.122 --> 07:36.154
we got to figure this out.
I mean,

07:36.156 --> 07:37.222
we can't keep her in there
forever.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.657
It's solid loge,

07:38.659 --> 07:40.058
but how will going
to Akron help?

07:40.060 --> 07:41.460
'Cause that's where
she grew up, man.

07:41.462 --> 07:42.928
That's where her
family's from.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.130
Her medical records
are probably there.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.599
Who knows what we could learn?
You know, and if nothing else,

07:47.601 --> 07:49.501
she'll get a little time
out of that box.

07:49.503 --> 07:51.336
Wait, she's going with us?

07:51.338 --> 07:52.804
Yeah, she wouldn't tell me
her address.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.841
(sighs)
Todd, if I'm being honest,

07:55.843 --> 07:58.009
I think
we're making a huge mistake

07:58.011 --> 07:59.344
for not having done this
earlier.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.947
You go grab Melissa,
I'll go get my travel underwear.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.149
(Todd yells)
Pick up that spare first.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.906
Picked up the spare!

08:29.876 --> 08:33.278
TANDY:
<i>Why are you being so stubborn</i>
<i>about giving us your address?</i>

08:33.280 --> 08:34.846
We're doing this
to help you.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.548
People are very
worried about you.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.049
You're sterile.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.352
And Carol's pregnant
with Mike's baby.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.553
Just words.

08:41.555 --> 08:44.055
You see, I-I'm rubber,
and you're glue,

08:44.057 --> 08:46.892
and whatever you say bounces
off me and sticks to you.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.059
So<i> you're</i> sterile.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.662
(laughs)

08:50.664 --> 08:52.664
See, now we're getting
somewhere, huh?

08:52.666 --> 08:54.399
Laughter is the
best medicine.

08:54.401 --> 08:57.569
No, I was just thinking
about your tiny penis.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.404
Carol told me
all about it.

08:59.406 --> 09:02.908
Uh, so you know
my balls are huge, though.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.676
She said
those are really small, too.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.412
I'm gonna have to talk
to Carol about this.

09:07.414 --> 09:10.248
And just so you know,
I'm proud of my little tea set.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.083
Yep, uh-huh, and by the way,

09:12.085 --> 09:14.920
<i>you</i> have a small penis. Mm-hmm.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.688
Okay, next subject.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.690
What is your freaking address
in Akron?

09:18.692 --> 09:20.392
One-Sixth of an Inch Avenue,

09:20.394 --> 09:23.328
Tandy's Penis Is Tiny City,
Ohio.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.330
(stammering): You know what--
you know what, where you live?

09:25.332 --> 09:27.766

09:37.678 --> 09:39.744

my penis is way larger

09:39.746 --> 09:41.379
than one-sixth of an inch.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.915
Well, larger than one-sixth

09:43.917 --> 09:45.784

09:45.786 --> 09:47.285

Oh.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.721
Uh, thanks.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.590
Oh, no, it's not
an age-related gift.

09:51.592 --> 09:52.891
This is for your leg.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.961
Now, see, I didn't really go
to the age thing,

10:01.969 --> 10:03.635
Sorry. Don't want to interrupt.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.036
Oh, Carol, it's okay.
Come hang out.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.438
CAROL:
Oh, no.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.074
No, I just noticed
that you weren't at our house.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.742
Of course you're not,
'cause you're right here.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.777
(chuckles)
Duh, Carol. Anyway,

10:12.779 --> 10:13.912
I didn't know
if you had

10:13.914 --> 10:16.414
left, left, like,
did you move out?

10:16.416 --> 10:18.283
'Cause you can.
I mean, I don't own you.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.417
I just don't know if
I should strip the bed

10:19.419 --> 10:21.820
or whatever,
just stop it, Carol!

10:21.822 --> 10:25.290
GAIL:
Carol? Carol.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.158
I'm still staying in there.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.594
Oh, yeah? That's awesome.

10:29.596 --> 10:30.996
Sweet, all right.
Cool, well, whatever.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.798
You know, just forget
I even showed up here.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.100
Rewind, right?

10:35.102 --> 10:36.835

10:43.176 --> 10:45.677
Okay. I know I'm
still recovering,

10:45.679 --> 10:48.813
but she's weirder
than normal, right?

10:48.815 --> 10:51.282
I really can't tell
anymore.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.284
TODD:
So this is you, huh?

10:53.286 --> 10:54.753
Ah, and just our luck,

10:54.755 --> 10:57.255
she lived in a
19-story walk-up.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.990
Hey, Melissa.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.159
Thanks for telling us
where you lived,

11:01.161 --> 11:03.194
this is really gonna help us

11:03.196 --> 11:05.997

some good memories or...

11:05.999 --> 11:07.165
Todd?

11:07.167 --> 11:10.135
You better come
take a look at this.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.302
Ah, God.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.171
TANDY:
I know.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.205
I mean, first of all,
she's dealing with

11:14.207 --> 11:15.206
the pain of adoption.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.207
And then,
they don't let her

11:16.209 --> 11:18.543
into any
of their family pictures.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.145
How brutal.

11:20.147 --> 11:22.047
Look what you made,
you monsters!

11:22.049 --> 11:23.548
Tandy, she's not adopted.

11:23.550 --> 11:24.716
(Melissa laughs)

11:24.718 --> 11:26.551
You know, Melissa,
this is not funny.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.853
Okay? Why won't you
let us help you?

11:28.855 --> 11:30.955
We need you to
take us to your house.

11:31.891 --> 11:34.225
Good night.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.360
(door closes)

11:35.362 --> 11:36.761
MELISSA:
Body in the bed.

11:37.730 --> 11:38.830
(body clunks on floor)

11:38.832 --> 11:39.998
All clear!

11:40.000 --> 11:42.567
Not a very
auspicious start.

11:42.569 --> 11:45.837
Yeah, that's probably, uh,
how the<i> Titanic</i> felt, as well.

11:45.839 --> 11:48.039
The movie, you know.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.408
You know,
second only to<i> Avatar.</i>

11:50.410 --> 11:52.177
That's a pretty cool thing.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.478
TODD:
<i>Tandy?</i>

11:53.480 --> 11:56.014
Tandy! Melissa's gone!

11:56.016 --> 11:57.248
What? Where?

11:57.250 --> 11:59.417
Ju... Come on!
I-I... Come on!

11:59.419 --> 12:01.419
TANDY: Where? Where?
I don't know!

12:01.421 --> 12:02.921
TODD:
<i>Damn it, we lost her again!</i>

12:02.923 --> 12:04.856
I'm stupid!
This is getting ridiculous!

12:04.858 --> 12:07.358
Todd, don't
panic, okay?

12:07.360 --> 12:09.227
Not to harp on
the<i> Titanic,</i>

12:09.229 --> 12:11.596
but there are solid lessons
to be gleaned there.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.765
Now, you remember
that string quartet

12:13.767 --> 12:16.234
and how calm they were
when the ship was sinking?

12:16.236 --> 12:18.103
Tandy, they sank with the ship
and died.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.537
Yes, in the movie.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.439
But yeah, no, now I'm talking
about the actual event.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.041
Yeah, they died
in that, too.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.375
Oh, they did, now?

12:24.377 --> 12:27.245
Huh.
Wait, Tandy,
loo-look!

12:28.948 --> 12:30.281
Oh, my God, one
of my billboards!

12:30.283 --> 12:32.817
No, look at the picture.

12:33.786 --> 12:35.687
(whispers):
Oh, my God.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.260
TODD:
<i>Melissa?</i>

12:42.262 --> 12:44.629
Melissa?

12:44.631 --> 12:46.364
Oh, hey, look at that.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.033
(chuckling):
Nice blazer.

12:49.035 --> 12:50.969
Blazer? I hardly
knew her. Boom.
Ah.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.871
Okay, let's look for her desk.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.539
Maybe we can figure out
where she lives.

12:54.541 --> 12:55.874
All right.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.876
Talk to me, Chartres,

12:57.878 --> 13:00.278
where'd you close those
mother friggin' deals?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.384
Aha! Got it.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.286
Got it, got it, got it.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.822
All right.
Okay, in order to
find out where she lives,

13:10.824 --> 13:12.457
we got to get ourselves
in the mindset.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.559
Okay, I'm on the phone,
I'm selling houses.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.227
Got a big house
on Baltic Avenue,

13:16.229 --> 13:18.229
got a red hotel
on Park Place.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.131
Okay, trapped
in a high stakes bidding war,

13:20.133 --> 13:22.100
this is gonna be
a long day.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.235
Okay, coffee, coffee, sale.
Coffee, sale.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.904
Sale, coffee.
Sale, sale.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.239
You know it's a good day when
you got more sales than coffees.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.975
Okay, 5:00 rolls around,
the whistle blows,

13:30.977 --> 13:33.444
the foreman yells,
"It's quitting time!"

13:33.446 --> 13:35.246
You clean up
your desk area.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.748
I crop-dust
my boss' office.

13:36.750 --> 13:38.817
They never guess it's me,
'cause I'm a lady in a blazer.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.151
Head for the door.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.653
But where do I go? Got it!

13:41.655 --> 13:42.921
Hmm?
Home.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.089
But where is home?

13:45.091 --> 13:46.858
Oh, Tandy, I got it.

13:46.860 --> 13:49.260
(laughs)
Of course!

13:49.262 --> 13:50.495
She's a subscriber

13:50.497 --> 13:51.796
to<i> Modern Bathroom and Kitchen</i>
magazine.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.765
It was right in front
of our faces the whole time!

13:53.767 --> 13:55.166
This is gonna lead us
right to her.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.835
Now where are the most modern
bathrooms and kitchens?

13:56.837 --> 13:58.169
New York City. Let's go.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.705
No, Tandy.
Chicago?

14:00.707 --> 14:02.607
No, her address is
on the magazine.
Even better!

14:02.609 --> 14:04.375
New York or Chicago?
It's Akron.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.611
Oh, that's handy.
Yeah.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.179
CAROL:

14:09.816 --> 14:11.516

14:11.518 --> 14:13.117

They're scoops, of course.

14:13.119 --> 14:17.121
Oh, Carol.
I don't need anything special.

14:17.123 --> 14:18.623
Copy that, Gail.

14:20.626 --> 14:23.061
You may have noticed
that I called you Gail?

14:23.063 --> 14:24.729
Rather than Mom.
(chuckles)

14:24.731 --> 14:27.131
Because you are obviously
not my mom.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.667
And those silly adoption papers
that I drew up,

14:29.669 --> 14:31.469
they were never official.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.470
So...

14:32.472 --> 14:34.072
Gail, just to clarify,

14:34.074 --> 14:36.975
I think what happened is I said,

14:36.977 --> 14:38.309
"Let's be mother and daughter."

14:38.311 --> 14:40.712
And you were like,
"You're serious?"

14:40.714 --> 14:43.882
And then you just ran with it
and I was like, "Gail, wait!"

14:43.884 --> 14:45.650
But you were
a runaway train.

14:45.652 --> 14:50.054

it was always Goof City, USA,

15:08.341 --> 15:11.843

doing this?

15:18.084 --> 15:20.351
