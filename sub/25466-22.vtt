Johnny Appleseed
never flew in a helicopter

09:54.898 --> 09:57.640
or spray-painted
a forest kitty!

09:57.684 --> 09:59.076
You know what?
Forget it.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.470
This has clearly been
a waste of everyone's time.

10:01.513 --> 10:04.734
Hey, don't be so hard
on yourself, dude.

10:04.778 --> 10:06.344
Friend Cyborg is correct.

10:06.388 --> 10:09.130
We do not need
the tall tales to inspire us.

10:09.173 --> 10:13.569
Your leadership inspires us
on a daily basis.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.701
Thank you.

10:14.744 --> 10:17.051
You guys
really mean that?

10:17.094 --> 10:17.965
No, fool!

10:18.008 --> 10:19.880
That be
another tall tale.

10:19.923 --> 10:21.142
[LAUGHING]

10:21.185 --> 10:23.535
[ALL LAUGHING
AND CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]

10:23.579 --> 10:25.668
CYBORG: Oh, you should've
seen your face!

10:25.712 --> 10:27.104
He is so disappointed!

10:27.148 --> 10:28.628
Howdy!
