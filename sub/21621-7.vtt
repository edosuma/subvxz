WEBVTT

00:02.969 --> 00:06.240
-What's up?
-Man, I'm so happy just chilling.

00:06.306 --> 00:08.242
-I know.
-It's a sunny day outside.

00:08.308 --> 00:10.878
Who would've ever thought
that we'd be sitting in this car

00:10.943 --> 00:13.180
doing Carpool Karaoke together?

00:13.247 --> 00:17.251
I'm getting misty-eyed about it.
We gotta sing some music.

00:17.317 --> 00:19.820
-Let's get hyped.
-Okay, let's sing something.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.832
I should just be
a background dancer for this one.

00:51.818 --> 00:53.787
Yeah!

00:53.854 --> 00:55.355
With what!

01:04.431 --> 01:06.867
-Oh, my God, La.
-You're going on tour with me.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.836
-We're gonna do "Ladies First".
-Hey, most definitely.

01:08.902 --> 01:14.675
I remember when you came to Baltimore
when I was 16 years old.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.744
And you were like
in an African skirt and you had...

01:17.811 --> 01:19.880
And your feet were bare
and I'll never forget.

01:19.947 --> 01:23.383
I got so hyped because I'd never seen
anything like you before.

01:23.450 --> 01:26.353
I was like, "Yo!"
I went up to the promoters.

01:26.420 --> 01:29.189
I was like,
"I have to introduce this artist."

01:29.256 --> 01:30.357
You sure did.

01:34.928 --> 01:39.099
-I know you know this.
-I knew all the dance moves at one point.

01:39.132 --> 01:41.401
I know you did.
I know you did, girl.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.444
That's that Jam and Lewis right there.

02:05.759 --> 02:08.595
-She don't like nasty fools.
-She don't like nothin' nasty.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.164
Here's the thing she like.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.574
I know. Sing.

02:32.085 --> 02:34.288
-She killed this video.
-She murdered this.

02:34.354 --> 02:36.390
Like her whole, like, kind of...

02:37.491 --> 02:39.860
What's up with that brake jamming?

02:39.927 --> 02:42.529
I think we're about to be called
"Carcrashpool Karaoke."

02:47.401 --> 02:53.140
Jada, you know I love you on Gotham
but you played that character really real.

02:53.207 --> 02:54.575
You played that to the bone.

02:54.641 --> 02:57.477
Yeah, that part right there.

02:57.544 --> 03:02.382
I wonder how much your "villain you"
or your "hero you" is real life.

03:02.449 --> 03:04.151
That depends on who you ask.

03:04.218 --> 03:08.422
I'm gonna ask you coz I prepared a game.
If you look in here, I got some paddles.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.624
Check it out, in the middle console.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.827
Look at you.
You got the villain and...

03:13.894 --> 03:15.195
OK.

03:15.262 --> 03:19.466
Have you ever bumped a car in the parking
lot and left without doing anything?

03:26.073 --> 03:30.077
Whoo! I was about to say,
"Ooh, you wrong for that."

03:30.077 --> 03:32.980
Yeah, I know. Never done that one.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.115
How about this?
Have you ever pretended to press

03:35.182 --> 03:39.119
the open door button on an elevator when
you know you were pressing the close door?

03:45.826 --> 03:49.096
Of course you did.
You were like: "Let me close this."

03:49.930 --> 03:53.800
I'll tell you, I've gotten trapped
in elevators so many times that

03:53.867 --> 03:56.370
I get paranoid when
it's too many of us on the elevator.

03:56.436 --> 03:58.939
Hell yeah, you one of them?
So you be like, close.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.808
I'd be like: "Oh, man."
And as the doors close,

04:01.875 --> 04:04.278
"I'm so sorry. I tried to... Ahh!"

04:05.679 --> 04:07.681
OK, how about this one?

04:07.748 --> 04:10.751
Have you ever made an excuse
to get out of your friend's invite

04:10.817 --> 04:14.521
to their three-year-old's ballet recital?

04:19.493 --> 04:21.894
-Ooh!
-I'm wrong for that.

04:21.962 --> 04:25.432
-She's only three.
-You know, I just be tired.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.704
If she's three, she's not gonna
remember I was there.

04:30.771 --> 04:34.208
So I'm going to wait till she's 12.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.677
-That's a big-ass leap.
-I'm just saying.

04:36.743 --> 04:39.780
She gonna remember around seven, eight.
At 12, you really do.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.582
-You're right.
-I think you're mostly a hero.

04:41.648 --> 04:44.184
-I hope.
-With some villain tendencies.

04:44.251 --> 04:46.587
Like I said,
it depends on who you ask.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.035
No.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.654
-Hi, lady.
-Hey.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.335
That's the part right there.

06:10.270 --> 06:13.707
You know how I used to get in
lip-sync contests

06:13.774 --> 06:15.409
and do Prince impersonations...

06:15.475 --> 06:17.110
-Like when?
-...to win money?

06:17.177 --> 06:19.146
-I would do "I Would Die 4U".
-Did you...

06:19.213 --> 06:21.748
-I'd do "Little Red Corvette".
-...dress up?

06:21.815 --> 06:23.817
Yes, I dressed up as Prince.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.620
I'll never forget meeting Prince
and showing him pictures

06:26.687 --> 06:28.922
and him being utterly disgusted with me.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.424
Oh, my God.

06:34.328 --> 06:38.165
Whoo. Come on, Prince. Hey.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.757
Yeah!

07:48.836 --> 07:51.471
Oh, snap. That's Regina. Hello?

07:52.606 --> 07:55.475
We're doing Carpool Karaoke today.

07:58.879 --> 08:01.014
Well, it's almost done today.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.016
We're pretty much wrapping it up.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.651
-Maybe next time.
-Yeah.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.655
-You're coming with us?
-Yeah, I'm coming with ya.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.023
Oh, snap.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.125
Just rolled right on up.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.627
Hi!

08:13.694 --> 08:16.797
-What's up?
-Hey.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.333
-Now we ready.
-Well, let's roll.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.177
Hey.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.720
Stiff robot.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.125
Hey, boo, I wanna have fun.

09:34.208 --> 09:36.076
Go!

09:36.143 --> 09:40.914
I almost got in a crossfire over here.
I just remembered that.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.749
-Crossfire?
-Yes.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.419
-Wait, hold up.
-This corner right here.

09:45.485 --> 09:46.954
-What were you doing?
-What happened?

09:47.054 --> 09:50.290
-I was driving.
-This must have been in the early '90s.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.658
It was!

09:51.725 --> 09:55.529
Yeah, we all got caught
in a gang crossfire.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.698
I've been in a couple of those.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.834
Some dudes were beefing
with some dudes across the street

10:00.901 --> 10:03.237
and all you see is everybody
was grabbing for...

10:03.303 --> 10:04.771
-Were you at a light?
-Yes.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.641
-I went through that red light so fast.
-You did.

10:07.708 --> 10:12.579
-The time to take that damn light.
-Gang crossfire, sounds right.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.815
But girls do like to have fun.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.783
I know. It's hard to.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.920
-Girls don't like to get shot, though.
-Girls don't like to get shot.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.996
We had so much fun doing Girls Trip.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.831
-I missed y'all, too.
-That was a blast.

10:30.898 --> 10:33.667
I feel I learned something
from every single one of y'all,

10:33.734 --> 10:37.171
just working with y'all,
I feel it made me grow as a human.

10:37.237 --> 10:41.208
Especially you, Regina.
You taught me how to be a ratchet.

10:41.275 --> 10:42.943
-But, Jada...
-Nice.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.746
-You taught me how to be classy.
-Oh my God.

10:45.812 --> 10:49.249
I know the promotion team
is making it happen.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.417
Yeah, they...

10:50.484 --> 10:52.553
-They're doing what they can.
-I think we can do better.

10:52.619 --> 10:55.389
I know we could do better.
We could at least help.

10:55.455 --> 10:58.926
-I got an idea how to get the word out.
-I like when you put on your thinking cap.

11:02.529 --> 11:05.699
-Across the street. Yeah, you!
-You got to see Girls Trip.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.068
Funniest movie of the summer.
Rated R comedy.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.905
Whoever you're talking to on the phone,
tell them we said to go see Girls Trip.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.273
Super funny.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.909
If it's a woman, take her.
If it's a man, take him.

11:17.277 --> 11:21.849
Hey, brother in the white truck.
Make sure you go see Girls Trip.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.884
-You're looking good.
-Family.

11:23.951 --> 11:27.754
Take your baby mama, your other
baby mama, your other, other baby mama.

11:27.821 --> 11:31.225
I got an idea.
We should shoot out these T-shirts.

11:31.291 --> 11:34.494
You want one, bro? There you go.

11:34.561 --> 11:37.831
-That's a good catch.
-Guys, check it out.

11:37.898 --> 11:38.999
T-shirt cannon.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.501
All right.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.436
There goes one over there
in the white.

11:42.503 --> 11:45.873
Oh, s***, Tiffany, what the f*** is you
doing with that T-shirt cannon?

11:45.939 --> 11:49.209
You know I used to be
a professional T-shirt cannon person.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.778
What's up there? Girls Trip!

11:53.347 --> 11:55.115
We ain't giving a T-shirt
away for nothing.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.450
They should be on everybody.

11:56.517 --> 11:58.452
Aww, yeah!

12:02.055 --> 12:04.491
We done made these boys
some feminists, I like it.

12:05.492 --> 12:08.262
Y'all got to go see Girls Trip. July 21st.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.731
-You will have free diamonds.
-And gold.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.267
That's for you, boo.

12:15.736 --> 12:16.803
Make sure y'all get that.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.843
Zebra hat! Make sure you see Girls Trip.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.847
This is a lot of work.
I don't even think we're getting paid.

12:26.914 --> 12:29.750
-I'm tired.
-We ain't getting paid for this?

12:29.816 --> 12:32.085
-We ain't getting paid for this.
-We done.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.621
I didn't know we weren't getting paid.
This is ridiculous.

12:34.688 --> 12:36.823
We could have been in Vegas.
