00:17.880 --> 00:19.800
I spoke to Dr.  Rogers.

00:21.040 --> 00:23.000
He was very pleased
with your progress.

00:23.600 --> 00:27.280
I passed the neuro
tests, I feel physically fit

00:28.120 --> 00:29.440
and I don't have any
more series to watch.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.040
Mike, you need more time.

00:33.160 --> 00:34.680
-You are not well yet...
-You are wrong.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.560
No I did not.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.080
But I don't decide.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.240
The body

00:42.400 --> 00:46.600
Your father especially
said you are ready.

00:48.320 --> 00:49.680
Here are the basic rules.

00:49.840 --> 00:51.800
- basic rules?
-Take it slow.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.040
Center stage and seriously
injured people are taboo.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.000
They only have an advisory role,

00:57.720 --> 00:59.720
and in a few weeks
we will reclassify you.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.720
Okay, I can handle that.

01:08.280 --> 01:09.480
Welcome back Dr.  Leighton.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.160
He said that?  You are back?

01:11.360 --> 01:14.280
I'm no longer an instructor,
but I'm back to work.

01:20.560 --> 01:21.560
What?

01:21.960 --> 01:23.760
Gabapentin, amitriptyline.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.560
Do you still have a
headache and nerve pain?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.760
I was in a coma for three months.
I also take topiramate.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.560
- Quiet.  I can do it.
-All right.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.400
Okay, let's do it!

01:38.520 --> 01:41.960
Angels, 12 cars are on the way.
14 unconscious patients.

01:42.120 --> 01:43.640
Five were already
dead, cause unknown.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.400
We found her like that in a house.
Five were already dead.

01:51.960 --> 01:54.600
Two lost consciousness.
Carbon monoxide poisoning?

01:54.840 --> 01:55.840
Maybe.

01:55.960 --> 01:57.600
Center Stage, please,
and this one too, and

01:57.720 --> 01:59.480
other critical cases,
the rest should...

01:59.640 --> 02:01.120
-Was there any drug accessories?
-No.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.160
... I want to know what
we have there, go on guys.

02:03.760 --> 02:04.920
Bring her in here.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.520
Arterial bleeding
from a head injury.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.960
He must have fallen
when he passed out.

02:11.480 --> 02:12.560
What's this?

02:13.040 --> 02:14.880
I don't know,
they all wear that.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.400
The rest of their
stuff is in here.

02:16.560 --> 02:17.560
I take this.

02:18.520 --> 02:19.520
What do we have here?

02:20.160 --> 02:22.000
I don't know, we're
just trying to find out.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.680
Let's prepare for a transfer.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.160
On three.  One two Three.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.840
This patient is short of breath!

02:28.960 --> 02:30.560
You have to
intubate, Dr.  Dixon.

02:31.160 --> 02:32.400
-Dr.  Rorish?
-Yes.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.880
You take over Paul
Wentworth, 42 from Ohio.

02:35.000 --> 02:35.960
Understood.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.800
I cannot intubate.
His airways swell.

02:38.320 --> 02:41.080
Take the endotracheal
tube and Risa, get a 6-0.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.440
-Yes, doctor.
-Dr.  Willis.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.280
You take over Charlie
Loffredo, 21 from Missouri.

02:45.920 --> 02:47.200
Keep 4-0 Prolene material ready.

02:47.480 --> 02:49.040
He then needs a CT.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.440
We need pacemaker pads here.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.840
The girl's name is Dana
Albright, 19, from Colorado.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.680
Sure you didn't
find it on a tour bus?

02:54.840 --> 02:56.320
Blood pressure and
pulse drop rapidly.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.880
I enter dopamine,
one, two, three.

03:01.360 --> 03:02.520
He throws up.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.040
-Suction and ondansetron, mom.
-Let's turn it.

03:05.960 --> 03:08.520
Dr.  Rorish, she's
breathless too.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.520
Put them next to the counter.  Dr.
Leighton, are you doing this?

03:11.640 --> 03:12.400
Yes.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.160
Why is he still having seizures?

03:20.320 --> 03:22.640
-The medication should work.
-Yes they should.

03:23.440 --> 03:25.600
Willis, do you have any ideas?

03:27.840 --> 03:30.520
That could be sarin gas.
There are the same symptoms.

03:32.080 --> 03:35.520
I can't get the tube in.
His neck is too swollen.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.160
He needs a cricothyrotomy.

03:39.640 --> 03:40.480
Watch out.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.040
The patient has
circulatory failure.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.360
- One of us fell over here.
-Someone has to help him.

03:56.840 --> 03:57.880
Sluggish.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.280
What the hell is going on in here?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.600
It is not a gas.
It sticks to them.

04:02.760 --> 04:03.920
It's her clothes.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.560
A cholinergic toxidrome.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.200
Listen all man!

04:08.360 --> 04:12.640
The patients have to get out of
here now.  Quickly and carefully.

04:12.840 --> 04:15.920
Nobody touches them until they
are decontaminated.  Come on!

04:16.040 --> 04:18.880
Get them out, cut
them all out of clothing.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.680
Take as much
atropine as you can.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.200
Path.  Clear the corridor.

04:22.840 --> 04:23.800
Fast fast!

04:25.600 --> 04:26.720
We are here.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.080
Get them in.
Put them down.  Come on!

04:31.720 --> 04:33.160
Cut open her clothes.

04:34.640 --> 04:35.760
Still seizures.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.600
Okay, the atropine
should work right now.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.120
What the hell?

04:41.600 --> 04:42.880
Is that supposed to be a joke?

04:43.360 --> 04:46.080
Guys, the bracelets are
firmly attached to them.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.600
What do you mean by "attached"?

04:48.160 --> 04:49.720
Do not remove the bracelet.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.440
We need an X-ray of this.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.440
What's happening?  Where am I?

04:54.800 --> 04:57.800
Where's dana?  Dana!

04:57.920 --> 05:00.680
Charlie, I'm here.
I'm over here.

05:00.840 --> 05:01.880
Stay calm.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.320
Dana!  You are not allowed to do anything!
They must not treat you!

05:07.520 --> 05:11.480
He knocked off his drip.
I can't give atropine.

05:11.640 --> 05:14.360
-Do you want a new access?
-No time.  Hold down.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.000
Come on buddy, stay down.
Gently.  Enter it!

05:20.320 --> 05:22.000
Has anyone seen my wife?

05:22.360 --> 05:24.800
Susan!  Susan!

05:25.320 --> 05:26.280
Susan!

05:26.840 --> 05:29.280
I'm so sorry.
She died on the spot.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.480
She did it!

05:39.320 --> 05:41.280
She did it!

05:48.040 --> 05:50.840
They seem to be connected
to the nerve cords of the wrist.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.560
What are they good for?

05:53.000 --> 05:55.400
Has anyone succeeded
except my wife?

05:56.760 --> 05:59.880
Five others died, if that's
what you mean by success.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.720
What are the bracelets for?

06:01.840 --> 06:03.640
Paul, listen to me,
the atropine stabilized

06:03.800 --> 06:07.040
you, but it is
becoming less effective.

06:07.320 --> 06:10.320
We don't know what it is
and things can get worse.

06:10.840 --> 06:13.280
At least say what
toxin you took.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.560
I insist on my right
to refuse treatment.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.960
I insist on my right
to refuse treatment.

06:25.240 --> 06:26.520
That's not scary at all.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.600
You are not allowed to remove

06:29.720 --> 06:31.520
the bracelet or give
me medical care.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.280
You are not allowed to remove

06:34.440 --> 06:36.640
the bracelet or give
me medical care.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.760
They apparently
poisoned their minds too.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.000
Poisoned?

06:42.960 --> 06:44.520
No, we transcend.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.560
Do you transcend?  What?

06:46.720 --> 06:49.960
Our 1.0 body.
We will live forever.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.080
Sounds stressful.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.200
We should separate
him from his disciples.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.400
I Agree.

06:56.560 --> 06:59.520
They are not disciples.
It's science, not religion.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.680
Science?  Clear.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.920
Okay, let's move
him to a private room.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.240
Are you not one of them?

07:07.360 --> 07:08.480
Can i see dana?

07:08.600 --> 07:10.680
First I have a couple of questions.
What did he use?

07:10.840 --> 07:13.760
A liquid, a gas?  Did it smell?

07:14.040 --> 07:16.640
He wanted to take
some kind of fertilizer

07:17.320 --> 07:20.520
I don't know what,
and horse shampoo.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.520
These are organophosphates.
He made pesticides himself.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.880
-We need 2 PAM.
-Yes, a lot of it.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.200
Understood.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.160
What about the bracelets?

07:30.360 --> 07:32.840
-Paul is a futurist.
-A futurist.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.440
And neurosurgeon as well as
biomedical engineer.  A genius.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.240
And besides, he's crazy.

07:38.480 --> 07:39.800
And the bracelet?

07:41.480 --> 07:45.120
He supposedly managed
to digitize our consciousness.

07:45.880 --> 07:49.240
The bracelet is connected
to the central nervous system.

07:49.360 --> 07:51.080
And at the moment
of death it should

07:51.200 --> 07:53.840
transfer our mind
into a virtual world,

07:55.320 --> 07:56.960
where we wait
for our new bodies.

07:57.080 --> 07:58.320
And you believed that.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.080
In the beginning it
was all theoretical.

08:01.240 --> 08:02.720
I didn't think we'd pull it off.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.920
-But you have.
-No.

08:06.440 --> 08:08.720
But I...

08:09.680 --> 08:12.360
I mean I stopped doing that.
I called 911.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.280
And I saw Dana
fall to the ground.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.160
He said we wouldn't
be scared, but I was.

08:17.320 --> 08:18.440
I was afraid.

08:18.640 --> 08:23.240
I pulled them out.
After that I don't know anything anymore.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.200
Is Dana your girlfriend?

08:26.720 --> 08:28.520
Oh my God.  What did we do!

08:30.320 --> 08:31.840
You are a psychologist.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.440
Is that so obvious?

08:34.039 --> 08:37.520
Dana, what brought you
to the Children of Elysian?

08:37.640 --> 08:39.000
Don't talk to her, Dana!

08:39.120 --> 08:40.720
It's not a secret to me.

08:42.240 --> 08:43.720
There is nothing she can say.

08:43.880 --> 08:46.960
If it's no secret how did
someone like you get here?

08:47.120 --> 08:48.320
I needed an answer

08:49.720 --> 08:51.160
and no one else had one.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.720
And Paul had the answer?

08:53.080 --> 08:55.240
He always asked
the same question.

08:57.240 --> 09:00.600
When we advance in
life through technology

09:02.560 --> 09:05.600
then why can't we
move forward in death?

09:07.720 --> 09:08.680
Dana?

09:08.800 --> 09:10.280
I need help here!

09:11.000 --> 09:14.280
Pulse oximeter is down to 72.
Blood pressure is 50 to 35.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.880
-Dana, can you hear me?
-You mustn't touch her!

09:17.000 --> 09:18.720
The atropine loses its effectiveness.
She needs 2-PAM.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.520
She said she doesn't
want to be treated.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.080
Sister, close the curtain.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.360
Dana, I'm here!  Be brave!

09:23.480 --> 09:25.600
-Did she refuse the treatment?
-Yes, all of them.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.360
-What are you doing?
-Is she sane?

09:27.480 --> 09:29.200
Yes, she seemed clear
and determined to me.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.720
Joining a cult, wiring
the nervous system,

09:31.880 --> 09:33.880
and poisoning yourself,
indicates sanity?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.320
An ampoule of 2-PAM, here.

09:37.280 --> 09:38.240
We have to talk about it.

09:38.360 --> 09:39.720
If we talk any
longer she will die.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.560
You are violating your rights.

09:42.680 --> 09:44.040
Dr.  Willis, she
refused treatment.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.320
She is hypoxic, her
brain is not getting oxygen.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.720
She cannot make a decision.

09:47.840 --> 09:48.800
Folks, she's going to collapse.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.920
In addition to the ethical
consequences, there are also legal ones!

10:00.040 --> 10:02.880
They joined a cult to email
each other in the future.

10:03.040 --> 10:04.680
Isn't that the
definition of insanity?

10:04.800 --> 10:06.120
No, it's not at all.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.320
I agree with Ethan.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.280
You are unable to
decide against treatment.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.880
Atropine is temporary.  We
don't have a lot of time to consider.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.760
In the end the damage
will be irreversible

10:15.000 --> 10:17.200
and the 2-PAM won't work.
For some it may be.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.880
Paul Wentworth is a doctor.
He calls them his patients.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.720
We don't like him
or his theories...

10:21.840 --> 10:22.800
I've heard enough.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.240
We treat them.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.840
Everyone gets 2-PAM immediately.

10:32.360 --> 10:33.680
Pretty good.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.440
Yes!  They had it!  Yes!

10:38.840 --> 10:39.960
Thank you!

10:40.120 --> 10:43.240
For a guy who was upset,
it's an interesting choice.

10:43.440 --> 10:46.080
We all have vices when
we get nervous or anxious.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.360
Some do fitness, others
meditate, others listen to Kanye.

10:49.520 --> 10:50.720
Nobody hears Kanye.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.600
No, for you it's...

10:52.720 --> 10:53.880
... just cheese balls.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.800
Is Eloise okay?
I heard she bumped her head.

10:59.280 --> 11:00.240
Yes, she is fine.

11:01.520 --> 11:02.560
There.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.480
Do you like my
nurse, sugar bear?

11:05.600 --> 11:07.880
I just worry...
from a medical point of view.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.840
-Medical.
-People.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.000
We have a lot of
patients who need doctors.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.760
Grab a file and
save a few lives.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.240
Are you heading the
internship program again?

11:16.360 --> 11:18.680
No, I'm just kicking all
of you in the ass again.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.800
-I wanted to eat with you...
-Linda...

11:28.920 --> 11:31.360
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be in the east by now?

11:31.720 --> 11:33.800
I thought we could get
to know each other better.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.120
Better?  Linda, I
don't know you at all.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.160
Let's change that.

11:38.400 --> 11:39.920
Okay look...

11:40.640 --> 11:41.960
You look very nice, but...

11:42.080 --> 11:43.440
I have no place
in my life for...

11:43.560 --> 11:44.760
...Family?

11:44.880 --> 11:47.280
You don't belong
in the family, right?

11:47.400 --> 11:49.200
You were Dad's girlfriend,
and now he's dead.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.520
Sorry, I have patients.
I have to go.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.680
Mario.  I'll be in
town for a while.

11:58.640 --> 11:59.840
Will you call me?

12:10.080 --> 12:11.880
He shouldn't have
climbed the tree.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.400
I just turned away for a second.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.240
-It's broken, right?
-Yes.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.440
It does not hurt.

12:18.440 --> 12:19.840
That's the adrenaline
rushing out of you, buddy.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.680
I'll call your mom
again, Keigan.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.720
His mother is outside.
She will kill me.

12:23.880 --> 12:25.920
Children fall down, don't
be so strict with yourself.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.560
He's hyperventilating.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.600
The mailbox is about to answer.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.200
Take a deep breath, Keigan.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.560
OK then.  And again.

12:36.800 --> 12:39.000
Jesse, this could
be a fractured rib.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.080
Let's do a chest X-ray.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.720
-I want to see his lungs.
-All right.

12:41.840 --> 12:43.880
And draw up ten
units of lidocaine.

12:44.480 --> 12:45.600
Keigan.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.920
I'm numbing your
wrist so we can fix this.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.960
You won't feel anything.
Promised.

13:01.640 --> 13:04.000
No hernial anesthesia,
let's just sedate him.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.760
No, he has a
fractured distal radius.

13:06.880 --> 13:10.880
That should go well.
Let me... damn it!

13:13.560 --> 13:15.640
Jesse, how about you sedate him?

13:16.240 --> 13:18.640
Two milligrams
per kilo of ketamine.

13:19.680 --> 13:20.800
Take a deep breath.

13:22.480 --> 13:23.440
Just like that.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.200
You can't stop me.

13:28.480 --> 13:29.840
Why do you want to
kill yourself so badly?

13:29.960 --> 13:31.360
I am not killing myself.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.800
Then explain it to me.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.280
You wouldn't understand.

13:38.120 --> 13:40.360
-A friend wanted to see you.
-Dana!

13:42.280 --> 13:43.240
As...

13:43.800 --> 13:45.840
-How could you?
-I couldn't stand your death.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.520
But I wouldn't have died.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.720
Sam is waiting for me
and you took that from me.

13:50.840 --> 13:51.800
Sam?

13:52.400 --> 13:53.960
It's getting stranger.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.000
Come on, Dana.
He's not waiting for you.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.240
There is nothing there but death!

13:57.360 --> 13:58.640
and how do you know that?

13:58.760 --> 14:01.920
Do you teach quantum
physics in vocational school?

14:04.880 --> 14:07.160
-It's not you, Dana.
-Where do you want to get that from?

14:07.280 --> 14:08.960
You don't know anything about me

14:09.080 --> 14:10.960
That wasn't exactly
one of our best plans.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.760
I know i love you  And
that you love me too.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.760
-I know that.
-Loving You?

14:15.880 --> 14:17.200
You are crazy.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.360
How many more times do
I have to tell you, Charlie?

14:20.480 --> 14:21.640
I am married!

14:24.480 --> 14:27.320
That's what this is all
about, and you know it!

14:29.360 --> 14:31.000
Oh my God.  He needs help!

14:31.120 --> 14:32.640
All right, let's get him to bed.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.080
I need a wheelchair.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.320
If you want me to go, I'll go.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.280
But only because I can't
watch you hurt yourself.

14:49.720 --> 14:53.120
Dana, what did you mean?
That it's only about one thing?

14:53.800 --> 14:55.720
My husband is waiting for me

14:56.840 --> 14:57.880
in Elysian.

14:58.760 --> 15:00.360
And where is this Elysian?

15:00.720 --> 15:03.440
This is a virtual world
that Paul created.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.840
A place where we
can be together.

15:11.960 --> 15:12.960
Thank you.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.320
What are you looking for, honey?
A vein?

15:25.480 --> 15:26.680
They are all skeletonized.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.560
If you mean every
millimeter of my body has

15:28.680 --> 15:30.880
been stabbed by my
radiation doctor, then yes.

15:31.240 --> 15:33.080
Ashley, this is Barbara.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.800
I can't make it to the
meeting, something came up.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.960
-I'm sorry.
-So.  I did it.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.800
I'm in the hospital.

15:41.520 --> 15:45.800
I broke my ankle.
We must move it.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.480
Stepdaughter.  I want
to evade your sympathy.

15:50.720 --> 15:53.520
The CT will definitely show us
whether it is an intestinal obstruction.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.680
This is quite common with
colorectal cancer patients.

15:55.800 --> 16:00.080
If you could read, you
would have read I had three.

16:01.840 --> 16:03.160
Okay so...

16:03.280 --> 16:05.600
We'll be back when
the radiology is ready.

16:05.720 --> 16:08.080
-I just can not wait it.
-How long will it take?

16:08.240 --> 16:09.400
It can take a few hours.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.640
Is there anyone
else we should call?

16:13.040 --> 16:15.640
Nobody wants to have anything
to do with that.  Trust me.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.320
You think i'm crazy don't you?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.200
I think you did something bad.

16:26.360 --> 16:29.480
You and I are the same.
We are both doctors.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.600
When you heard about heaven,
did you think it was crazy?  I do.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.560
But how do you know that is
exactly what God didn't mean?

16:39.080 --> 16:41.160
Just as he led
Moses to Mount Sinai,

16:41.320 --> 16:43.320
or Noah to the ark,
how do you know

16:43.760 --> 16:45.640
that he didn't take
me to Elysian?

16:45.760 --> 16:46.800
So are you a prophet?

16:46.920 --> 16:49.440
These are your words, not mine.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.360
Your heaven...

16:52.480 --> 16:53.600
How is it there?

16:54.520 --> 16:55.560
There is no guilt.

16:57.400 --> 16:58.560
There is no more grief.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.240
There is no more regrets.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.359
There is no more pain.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.640
It's just not part
of the program.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.160
People like you always promised

17:13.280 --> 17:16.319
To alleviate pain since
the beginning of time.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.440
- Let's talk about your pain.
-D rather not.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.800
It is obvious.
It is your burden.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.079
You don't have to
bring them to Elysian.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.360
Your blood pressure rises.
Do you have high blood pressure?

17:30.480 --> 17:33.160
-I see you...
-Who do you see, Paul?

17:34.840 --> 17:36.240
His blood pressure
skyrockets him.

17:36.560 --> 17:37.640
His pulse too.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.040
Paul.

17:41.520 --> 17:44.000
-He's having a fit.
-Give him more lorazepam.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.280
I have him.

17:48.560 --> 17:49.720
Okay here.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.840
So good.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.520
The seizure caused
a dislocated shoulder.

18:01.960 --> 18:03.160
Do you mind

18:06.920 --> 18:08.520
It was way too easy.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.760
An arm isn't that loose
after just one attack.

18:12.160 --> 18:14.520
Maybe he's got bigger
problems than the poison.

18:35.640 --> 18:37.480
So Dana is still alive?
Is she OK?

18:37.600 --> 18:38.840
She is stable.

18:39.240 --> 18:41.120
When was the last time you
heard from your daughter?

18:41.280 --> 18:42.440
About six months ago.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.400
She sent us a message
that Sam had died.

18:44.680 --> 18:45.680
His poor mother.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.040
When we wanted to enter the
property, we were sent away.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.600
She didn't even
want to talk to us.

18:50.120 --> 18:51.920
Could we take
this a little slower?

18:52.120 --> 18:55.680
Sam was our neighbor boy.
They were inseparable.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.360
Since they were
16, they wanted to

18:58.480 --> 18:59.720
get married as
soon as it was legal.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.200
And then he got the diagnosis.

19:02.720 --> 19:03.840
Leukemia.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.800
He was given another year.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.760
They looked for
alternative therapies,

19:08.880 --> 19:10.840
they went from one
quack to the next.

19:11.160 --> 19:12.280
Of course, none of it worked.

19:12.440 --> 19:14.400
Then she heard from Paul
and the Children of Elysian.

19:14.560 --> 19:18.240
He said he couldn't heal
Sam's body, but he could free it.

19:18.360 --> 19:19.880
Better yet, Dana could join him.

19:20.200 --> 19:23.000
So she thinks she
sees Sam in this Elysian.

19:23.320 --> 19:24.760
That's not how we raised them.

19:24.960 --> 19:28.120
Why did the monster
hypnotize my baby?

19:28.280 --> 19:29.400
Apply for guardianship.

19:29.520 --> 19:30.920
But you might not get it.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.560
Why not?  She is obviously sick.

19:32.720 --> 19:35.160
Because the court may
not find them incompetent.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.600
But it would if you suggest it.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.120
Can we see them

19:41.120 --> 19:42.480
I'm sorry, she refused.

19:51.240 --> 19:54.080
I wonder why you're
on the wrong side here.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.920
I don't want that.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.440
But I also know that
in relation to the psyche

19:58.800 --> 20:00.800
People cannot be forced to heal.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.000
You have to want it yourself.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.520
Take a look at it.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.800
You know how to read a CT.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.960
-Everything I saw...
-You didn't see anything.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.400
The seizures stop when
we remove the tumor.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.040
And also the visions.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.040
That's funny.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.840
I'm a neurosurgeon, but
that never crossed my mind.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.760
Even if it makes sense.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.080
I have to tell you the truth.

20:52.320 --> 20:53.560
You deserve to know.

21:06.440 --> 21:08.960
I thought the pain
killers would help.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.440
Still have a stomach ache?

21:11.640 --> 21:13.160
Like a scene from alien.

21:14.680 --> 21:18.120
Not hardened, but white blood
cells and temperature are high...

21:19.920 --> 21:21.320
Where's the plaster of paris?

21:22.320 --> 21:25.880
Your ankle is actually what?
The lift that you wanted?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.040
This is a county
hospital, Ashley.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.800
Studying on Brown
was a waste, wasn't it?

21:30.960 --> 21:33.640
Not today.  Dad's house has
been negotiating for a year

21:33.760 --> 21:35.960
-it should all be clarified.
-Not that you have your money...

21:36.160 --> 21:37.720
-Then you cancel.
-... not before the weekend.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.720
It's not about the money, Barbara.
I want my parents' house.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.200
-More is not left of them.
-My stuff is in there

21:43.360 --> 21:44.600
because your
father left it to me.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.800
-And you were a guest in the house.  For
-20 years?

21:46.920 --> 21:47.880
Yes...

21:48.000 --> 21:49.360
Your stepmother
is pretty sick, so...

21:49.480 --> 21:50.520
So...

21:51.880 --> 21:54.640
Why don't you go out
and we'll do our job.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.640
Just get her out
of here, please.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.880
Listen all man!

22:21.640 --> 22:23.480
The doctors told me the truth.

22:25.560 --> 22:26.720
I have a tumor.

22:28.120 --> 22:29.680
It caused my seizures.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.920
And he explains
my vision of Elysian.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.000
My tumor

22:40.360 --> 22:41.960
was another gift from God.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.040
Okay, that's enough now.

22:44.160 --> 22:47.160
He gave me what I
needed to go into the future.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.920
So that we can meet
his highest expectations.

22:50.040 --> 22:53.560
There is no more guilt,
no grief, no remorse.

22:53.680 --> 22:56.440
We will not give up.
We love you Paul.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.040
See you in Elysian.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.520
See you in Elysian.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.200
His pulse oximeter reads 75.

23:10.360 --> 23:12.200
What's wrong with him?
Help him!

23:12.320 --> 23:13.760
He is worse off.

23:13.880 --> 23:15.640
Could be a complication
of the broken rib.

23:15.760 --> 23:18.080
-Put on a non-rebreather.
-His chest x-ray was normal.

23:20.040 --> 23:22.280
No, he has a pneumothorax
on his left side.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.880
-Let me see that.
-I do that.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.120
How could I miss that?

23:25.320 --> 23:26.520
Will he get well again?

23:26.640 --> 23:28.400
We need to intubate his
chest so he can breathe.

23:28.520 --> 23:29.520
Prepare the chest drain.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.640
Dr.  Leighton, the chest tube.

24:27.240 --> 24:28.400
I'm ready.

24:31.280 --> 24:32.320
I am brave.

24:40.160 --> 24:41.520
Okay, please.

24:46.760 --> 24:48.520
Do you hear the stridor

24:48.640 --> 24:49.920
This is strange
even for a pneumo.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.800
-Back back, Dr.  Leighton.
-Is he going to get well again?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.160
Yes he will be again.

24:54.280 --> 24:55.400
And again.

24:56.520 --> 24:58.160
Scalpel, please.  Thank you.

24:58.400 --> 25:01.120
-Mike.  Listen to me!
-Angus, get out of there!

25:03.840 --> 25:06.160
Keigan, you are going to
feel some pressure now.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.040
OK.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.640
-Wait!  Mike!  Stop!
-What?

25:18.480 --> 25:20.120
This is not his x-ray!

25:20.280 --> 25:22.640
It's not from Keigan.
You took the wrong one.

25:23.560 --> 25:24.880
His airways close.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.960
I need a unit of Epi and
125 methylprednisolone, now!

25:28.200 --> 25:29.800
He has a rash.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.200
His pharynx is swollen.
It's anaphylaxis.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.120
What's happening?

25:35.840 --> 25:37.040
Hang in there, buddy.  Hold on.

25:38.760 --> 25:40.040
-Input.
-OK.

25:43.320 --> 25:44.800
Okay, the stridor is getting less.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.080
His pulse oximeter
readings go up.

25:46.320 --> 25:47.920
All good.

25:49.440 --> 25:50.880
Please, buddy.

25:56.200 --> 25:57.600
Keigan will be fine.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.360
But we have to keep him
here for a few more hours.

26:01.480 --> 26:02.440
OK.

26:10.840 --> 26:12.320
Hey where are you going

26:12.480 --> 26:13.840
-I need to see him, please.
-No.

26:15.160 --> 26:16.920
-He took my daughter from me.
-I understand that.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.440
I want him to explain it to me.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.160
I need to understand
how that happened.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.800
Listen, he can't
do anything for you.

26:22.920 --> 26:25.360
Focus on your daughter again.

26:25.800 --> 26:26.920
No!

26:28.680 --> 26:29.720
Jesse!

26:31.200 --> 26:32.640
No no!

26:32.800 --> 26:34.080
Here here!

26:34.280 --> 26:35.720
Cut him off!

26:35.840 --> 26:38.160
No!  You don't die!

26:38.280 --> 26:39.800
Not now!

26:39.960 --> 26:42.080
Okay, let's let him down.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.640
You don't die!

26:45.800 --> 26:46.960
Not now!

26:47.120 --> 26:49.240
There's no Elysian Valley
for you yet, you sick bastard.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.360
How are you now, Barbara?

26:54.160 --> 26:55.800
The pain is bothering me.

26:57.520 --> 26:58.480
Oh God.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.120
Are you still there?

27:06.680 --> 27:07.760
Do you feel any pain?

27:09.320 --> 27:10.560
Tell me what's wrong with you

27:11.120 --> 27:14.880
My therapist has four
houses thanks to this question.

27:15.000 --> 27:15.960
Barbara.

27:16.480 --> 27:17.640
Colon cancer.

27:18.560 --> 27:20.200
How long have you known?

27:20.560 --> 27:21.560
For about a year.

27:21.680 --> 27:22.720
And you never called.

27:23.520 --> 27:26.000
-You don't either.
-I don't have cancer.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.560
-How long did Dad have Alzheimer's?
-Oh God.

27:29.720 --> 27:30.560
Two years before you told me?

27:30.680 --> 27:33.280
-I did not know it.
-But yes.

27:33.800 --> 27:36.600
You close up when things get
bad and pretend there is nothing.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.640
Like me.  You avoided me too.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.000
I'm avoiding things?

27:41.280 --> 27:43.320
I was with him, day after day,

27:43.440 --> 27:44.880
as he lost himself
more and more.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.480
I fed him, bathed him

27:47.680 --> 27:50.160
and I didn't even
get a thank you!

27:50.280 --> 27:52.760
That's unfair, I wanted to be
there, but you were so mean...

27:52.880 --> 27:55.840
You already hated me when I
didn't even go into the house.

27:55.960 --> 27:56.960
Why should i hate you

27:57.080 --> 27:59.120
Because I wasn't your mother.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.560
Barbara?

28:04.480 --> 28:05.440
Barbara?

28:05.560 --> 28:06.600
- She's in shock.
-Barbara!

28:06.840 --> 28:08.920
Hard stomach, it must
have a perforated bowel.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.200
Let's put her on the IV.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.480
Call the OR and
get the CT ready.

28:12.600 --> 28:13.840
Will she be fine again?

28:16.400 --> 28:17.560
Here is a needle.

28:18.240 --> 28:19.720
I'm sorry, Barbara.

28:21.280 --> 28:23.600
She is hot.  It's not a
perforation, it's typhlitis.

28:24.760 --> 28:25.920
We give her vasopressors.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.440
May I ask a question?

28:41.440 --> 28:44.600
Have you ever mourned
your husband Sam?

28:45.960 --> 28:47.680
Why should I mourn

28:48.360 --> 28:49.640
He is not dead.

28:51.240 --> 28:52.200
Oh yes.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.440
I want to show you something.

29:11.080 --> 29:14.840
They think I'm
scared to see them.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.840
Sophia is at home now.

29:21.840 --> 29:23.280
She did it.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.040
I'll see her again soon.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.760
It's not Sophia.

29:38.920 --> 29:39.880
Charlie...

29:53.480 --> 29:56.720
Dana you know

29:57.360 --> 30:00.280
what is organophosphate
poisoning as a cause of death?

30:03.560 --> 30:05.080
First his airways closed

30:05.600 --> 30:07.400
as if a hand had
wrapped around his neck.

30:08.680 --> 30:10.040
Then he vomited

30:10.520 --> 30:12.800
uncontrollable, he
literally drowned in it.

30:15.440 --> 30:18.360
We shocked him with 360 joules,

30:18.520 --> 30:21.200
which is like a horse
kick in the chest.

30:23.840 --> 30:26.400
His mind was still awake...

30:27.760 --> 30:30.200
The smell of your own
burnt meat on your nose.

30:31.520 --> 30:34.080
His ribs broken from
the resuscitation.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.160
They rose from the
breastbone with a crack,

30:36.480 --> 30:40.040
like ice breaking deep
beneath the surface.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.840
There was no Elysian for Charlie.

30:53.080 --> 30:54.800
There wasn't even dignity.

30:55.720 --> 30:58.440
Now he's here in this icy room.

30:58.560 --> 30:59.720
And if no one comes
for him, he'll be buried

30:59.840 --> 31:02.080
in the grave of the
Nameless in Potters Field.

31:02.520 --> 31:05.120
And nobody will
ever remember him.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.600
I will remember him.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.560
Are you sure?

31:15.080 --> 31:16.920
Do you remember
things in Elysian?

31:20.480 --> 31:21.520
I know grief.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.440
Better than most.

31:24.600 --> 31:25.680
I want to tell you one thing...

31:29.640 --> 31:31.200
You can't escape grief.

31:32.320 --> 31:34.080
You can only get through it.

31:58.240 --> 31:59.640
But at some point you did it.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.360
Somehow

32:03.000 --> 32:04.360
get through this.

32:18.680 --> 32:19.920
Hi Dana.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.560
Dr.  Rorish thought
you might want to talk.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.280
I can't cry

32:26.640 --> 32:27.720
What do you mean by that?

32:28.880 --> 32:30.680
I know that I should

32:31.760 --> 32:32.880
but I can not.

32:37.640 --> 32:39.960
Am I still human at all?

32:41.960 --> 32:43.080
Of course you are.

32:53.600 --> 32:55.040
How is she doing?

32:55.200 --> 32:56.760
The surgeons successfully
removed her bowel,

32:58.240 --> 33:00.480
but during the operation

33:00.680 --> 33:02.960
they found more
tumors in their spine.

33:03.960 --> 33:05.360
We can make it as
easy as possible for

33:05.480 --> 33:07.800
her, but she doesn't
have much time left.

33:08.960 --> 33:09.920
You...

33:10.160 --> 33:11.480
You can now visit her.

33:11.640 --> 33:13.720
I don't know what to tell her.

33:15.800 --> 33:18.240
She's just the woman
who married my dad.

33:18.440 --> 33:19.800
She seemed to have
loved him very much.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.520
You both have that
in common, don't you?

33:24.120 --> 33:26.280
She doesn't belong to my family.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.040
She is part of
your father's family.

33:28.880 --> 33:31.280
And maybe the
family is your family

33:31.560 --> 33:32.560
yes your family.

33:33.520 --> 33:34.800
If that makes sense.

33:56.720 --> 33:57.680
Hi.

34:00.680 --> 34:01.840
I am so sorry.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.120
Did i die

34:03.720 --> 34:05.360
Does this look
like heaven to you?

34:05.920 --> 34:08.560
You are funny.

34:09.520 --> 34:11.199
You were always so funny.

34:11.960 --> 34:13.199
You were right earlier.

34:14.679 --> 34:17.360
I never thanked you
for taking care of him.

34:19.400 --> 34:20.880
Thank you, Barbara.

34:25.199 --> 34:26.600
It was a hard job

34:27.560 --> 34:29.040
you coped with them
without complaining.

34:29.440 --> 34:32.560
Are you kidding?
I kept complaining.

34:33.480 --> 34:36.239
But I was glad that
strangers never had to do it.

34:37.679 --> 34:38.760
The truth is,

34:39.080 --> 34:40.719
I would have done
anything for this man.

34:42.400 --> 34:43.840
I loved him so much.

34:44.239 --> 34:45.440
I know that.

34:46.239 --> 34:47.320
Oh stop

34:48.080 --> 34:50.840
I'm not saying that sometimes
you are not impossible

34:51.800 --> 34:53.520
because that's you,
but I want to say...

34:53.639 --> 34:54.800
Hey...

34:55.960 --> 34:57.640
I love you too, little one.

35:27.640 --> 35:28.840
They love you, Dana.

35:30.560 --> 35:32.440
They're still the same
as they always were.

35:33.920 --> 35:34.880
OK?

36:38.160 --> 36:39.920
I am so sorry.

37:06.160 --> 37:08.480
Many people struggled
to keep you alive.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.160
Sorry that it didn't
turn out as you hoped.

37:12.840 --> 37:14.240
60 years ago

37:15.600 --> 37:18.880
a doctor would have
pronounced me crazy if I

37:19.920 --> 37:23.480
would have told him that you can
see fetuses through the abdominal wall.

37:23.880 --> 37:28.200
But in 1956 an obstetrician
used an ultrasound for this.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.920
And now you use
ultrasound every day.

37:32.040 --> 37:34.720
You're right.
The technology is wonderful.

37:35.280 --> 37:36.920
And she saved your life today.

37:37.200 --> 37:39.120
But it wouldn't have
worked without people.

37:39.240 --> 37:40.760
We don't say

37:40.960 --> 37:43.240
that the future
exists without people,

37:43.600 --> 37:45.360
but that it expands.

37:45.720 --> 37:49.480
There will be no more
sickness, no more loss.

37:50.520 --> 37:51.840
No pain.

37:53.240 --> 37:54.600
I want my pain.

37:55.760 --> 37:58.280
Why would you want to feel pain?

37:58.400 --> 37:59.720
Because I want to feel love.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.760
I feel pain because
I miss people.

38:04.920 --> 38:08.200
I feel it because I love her.

38:11.240 --> 38:13.840
I wouldn't want to trade
this love for anything.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.200
Not even the pain.

38:30.240 --> 38:31.880
I was surprised that you called.

38:32.080 --> 38:34.840
I thought to myself i drink
coffee, you drink coffee

38:35.040 --> 38:36.160
so why not?

38:38.120 --> 38:39.240
Nice.

38:39.920 --> 38:41.040
Do not celebrate too early.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.280
Too late.

39:07.080 --> 39:08.640
Keigan had a bee sting.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.000
That caused the anaphylaxis.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.000
This is my favorite place.

39:18.520 --> 39:20.760
When I think of how many
doctors have climbed those steps...

39:22.760 --> 39:24.560
I can feel the story.

39:27.080 --> 39:29.080
I felt it when I
first climbed it.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.200
I knew I was part of a legacy.

39:35.680 --> 39:37.120
Mike, just give it some time.

39:38.840 --> 39:41.200
You can do it, Mike.

39:48.920 --> 39:49.960
Here.

39:50.320 --> 39:51.920
Wait.

39:52.040 --> 39:54.240
I wanted to come
back early, Angus.

39:54.920 --> 39:56.840
And I wanted to find my
way back to everyday life

39:58.080 --> 40:01.400
but that doesn't even
exist for me at the moment.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.640
I am not the same anymore.

40:05.280 --> 40:06.640
I don't know when
I can be it again.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.000
This is yours now.
