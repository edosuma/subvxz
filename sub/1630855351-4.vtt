00:08.394 --> 00:13.315
I don't know how Brother Kelvin does it.
My nerves are in knots right now.

00:14.149 --> 00:16.443
- I can handle it if you want me to.
- No.

00:16.818 --> 00:19.404
He gave the responsibility to me.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.366
It's my duty to achieve.

00:27.788 --> 00:32.500
Hiya. I'll be today's leader of this
ice cream and wiener party.

00:33.961 --> 00:37.046
Also-and this is also Tarin.
If you need anything.

00:37.046 --> 00:39.716
- Where is Kelvin?
- Nothing bad has happened to him.

00:39.716 --> 00:41.551
He's not dead.
He believes in me so much,

00:41.551 --> 00:44.472
he gave me this opportunity
to prove myself.

00:44.472 --> 00:48.225
You know, this is good, because
we've known Kelvin for years,

00:48.225 --> 00:50.935
but we haven't had the pleasure
of getting to know you yet, Keefe.

00:50.935 --> 00:53.105
Keefe is a sick breakdancer.

00:54.064 --> 00:57.943
Well, you've got their respect.
That's the most important thing.

00:58.610 --> 01:01.113
Hey, Blondie.
It is you.

01:01.988 --> 01:03.698
- Oh, no.
- I know you!

01:04.658 --> 01:06.452
Yeah, buddy,
it's me, Clarence.

01:06.452 --> 01:08.745
I own the adult emporium
off the highway.

01:09.080 --> 01:10.873
You cleaned me out
a couple days back.

01:10.873 --> 01:13.334
Bought every last butt-buzzer
I had I stock.

01:13.334 --> 01:16.295
You stop by next week.
We just got some premium fuck dolls.

01:16.295 --> 01:17.754
Take care, buddy.

01:24.761 --> 01:28.724
It's not what you think.
It's something we did with your kids.

01:32.478 --> 01:37.941
Why don't we all enjoy
some ice creams and wieners together?

01:51.247 --> 01:55.835
Thank you. Good afternoon.
A pleasure to be a part of the society.

01:57.836 --> 02:00.713
- Who you planning to shoot?
- Ain't shoot nobody.

02:00.713 --> 02:03.801
I'm practicing some potential moves
for my swearing in ceremony.

02:03.801 --> 02:06.345
- Like choreography to music?
- No.

02:06.804 --> 02:08.930
This is a very serious organization.

02:08.930 --> 02:12.517
Cape and Pistol is the most elite
of ministers and pastors.

02:13.560 --> 02:17.023
My daddy was a lot older than me
when they finally swore him in.

02:17.023 --> 02:20.233
And yet here I am.
My time to shine.

02:20.233 --> 02:24.071
Finally, motherfuckers.
Nothing can stop me now.

02:24.071 --> 02:26.574
What the hell are you doing, dummy?

02:26.574 --> 02:28.616
Can't anybody have any
damn privacy around here?

02:28.951 --> 02:30.786
Pontius, can you take Michaela
and go somewhere?

02:30.786 --> 02:33.037
Like where?
You said we weren't allowed in my room.

02:33.037 --> 02:34.915
You can go outside.
Enjoy some nature.

02:35.374 --> 02:37.542
Nature sucks.
Shit's boring.

02:37.542 --> 02:39.962
You got a really smart-ass mouth
for a little boy

02:39.962 --> 02:42.756
who didn't get accepted
into one single college.

02:42.756 --> 02:45.759
How come none of them mouth smarts
are in your brain, dickhead?

02:45.759 --> 02:47.928
If you wanna be a winner
like your old man,

02:47.928 --> 02:50.680
who's being inducted into
a super exclusive organization...

02:51.474 --> 02:54.477
...you're going to college.
You can pick it or we will.

02:54.477 --> 02:57.605
I bet you the boys of the Citadel
would split your ass

02:57.605 --> 03:00.023
like a pair of Chinese chopsticks.

03:00.023 --> 03:02.360
You can pay for classes,
don't mean I'll go.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.652
Don't mean I'll go.

03:03.652 --> 03:07.073
This whole Pete Davidson act
you got going on does not suit you.

03:07.073 --> 03:12.118
Tattoos and a dumb-ass haircut?
It's not original. You're not him.

03:12.118 --> 03:15.748
- I'm not trying to be Pete Davidson.
- Well, good, because you're not.

03:15.748 --> 03:17.249
Fuck my parents.

03:18.792 --> 03:22.630
- I do not like his girlfriend.
- She definitely seems like a bitch.

03:26.509 --> 03:30.261
- Reading about Hitler?
- No, asshole. John Adams.

03:30.638 --> 03:32.180
The pleasures of retirement is

03:32.180 --> 03:35.101
you don't have to work on a sermon
on a Sunday morning.

03:35.101 --> 03:37.727
You seen my boys?
They're gonna to be late for church,

03:37.727 --> 03:40.271
even if it is a TV show church.

03:40.271 --> 03:42.941
- They left a couple hours ago.
- Where they go?

03:43.567 --> 03:45.069
Getting ready for church.

05:26.921 --> 05:33.218
Praise the Lord,
his righteousness at hand.

05:34.345 --> 05:40.559
Holy war, the battle has begun.

05:41.143 --> 05:44.687
So praise the Lord,

05:45.189 --> 05:50.111
his righteous love has come.

05:53.572 --> 05:55.074
I know.

05:56.074 --> 05:59.160
- You all are crazy.
- That ain't right.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.997
The haircuts are good,
but I don't love those suits.

06:01.997 --> 06:05.042
- What's that material?
- Silk, momma.

06:05.042 --> 06:09.922
- I don't like how shiny it is.
- It's supposed to be shiny, I think.

06:09.922 --> 06:13.008
- It is. That's considered good.
- Good for a lady's negligee.

06:13.008 --> 06:15.678
A little loud and proud for me.
But that's fine.

06:15.678 --> 06:19.056
You can't ever give it up.
Always talking that trash.

06:19.056 --> 06:21.891
I mean, their lives sure have improved
since coming here.

06:21.891 --> 06:24.729
Karl's presenting like a straight-up
cunt-smasher now.

06:25.603 --> 06:27.230
Hi, everybody!

06:28.899 --> 06:30.192
Peter!

06:30.192 --> 06:33.279
- You got no business here, Peter.
- I come in peace.

06:33.279 --> 06:36.073
I'm here to apologize to my sons,
and that's it.

06:56.260 --> 07:00.930
All right. I'll make this quick.
Boys, I apologize. I was wrong.

07:02.141 --> 07:06.687
I accused you of being betrayers,
and now I know that it wasn't you.

07:06.687 --> 07:08.563
- Who was it, Pa?
- Lucas.

07:09.231 --> 07:11.941
Fat-ass Lucas.
I believe it.

07:12.568 --> 07:15.779
And now I'd like you
to come back home with me.

07:15.779 --> 07:20.117
We got a brand-new place.
It's a beautiful old farm.

07:20.492 --> 07:23.620
Like real nice.
Tons of birds.

07:23.620 --> 07:26.248
They ain't going nowhere with you.
You go home to your tons of birds.

07:26.582 --> 07:29.084
I think the boys can speak
for themselves.

07:31.337 --> 07:32.505
Well?

07:38.802 --> 07:41.721
Papa, we got a good thing going here.

07:43.098 --> 07:45.810
The Gemstones,
they've been like family.

07:46.143 --> 07:51.148
'Cause they gave you some fancy
haircuts? Some new clothes?

07:51.148 --> 07:56.237
You think you look like slick boys?
You look silly. plain ridiculous.

07:58.154 --> 08:02.117
We ain't going, Pa.
Please leave.

08:02.535 --> 08:04.077
Yeah. Read the room, dude.

08:04.077 --> 08:07.581
You're gonna read the back of my hand
if you sass me again, Judy.

08:07.581 --> 08:10.376
You're gonna get your ass shot if you
don't get the fuck out of here.

08:10.376 --> 08:13.879
- Who's gonna shoot me?
- I am.

08:13.879 --> 08:16.464
I was about to say
the same fucking thing.

08:17.632 --> 08:19.384
Beat us to the draw.

08:28.102 --> 08:32.814
You all Gemstones of the Rednecks.
Look at you.

08:37.068 --> 08:38.279
Fine.

08:40.948 --> 08:45.994
Little Gabriel is gonna blow his horn.
When he does, the reckoning will come.

08:47.537 --> 08:51.708
I think he might be blowing that horn
a little sooner than you think.

08:55.296 --> 08:56.671
Honk!

08:59.759 --> 09:02.470
It happened so fast.
I didn't have time to shoot him.

09:02.470 --> 09:04.347
Why did he honk my nose?

09:04.347 --> 09:07.683
I assume he identified you
as the weakest person at this table.

09:09.268 --> 09:11.062
When did you guys get guns?

09:13.229 --> 09:17.234
"Keefe is creepy. I'm not comfortable
with him around kids."

09:17.902 --> 09:19.778
I told you, it's no good.

09:21.696 --> 09:26.659
This is bonkers.
What the fudge, Keefe?

09:26.994 --> 09:29.830
You had one job.
It's your only responsibility.

09:30.623 --> 09:32.165
What happened?

09:32.165 --> 09:36.879
I bumped into that fellow that
I bought all the bullets and the dildos

09:36.879 --> 09:40.674
and the butt-buzzers and the plugs
and stuff from at the porno store,

09:40.674 --> 09:43.052
and he outed me
in front of the parents.

09:44.260 --> 09:47.138
Did you explain that you bought
all this stuff on church business?

09:47.138 --> 09:49.224
I tried, but I just couldn't seem
to articulate

09:49.224 --> 09:52.185
how buying bunches of sex toys was
in the best interest of the church.

09:52.185 --> 09:59.526
Keefe, if you are not capable of
running Parents and Teens United,

09:59.526 --> 10:02.779
are you really qualified to
be my assistant youth pastor?

10:02.779 --> 10:04.447
No.

10:06.032 --> 10:07.159
Yes.

10:07.159 --> 10:11.996
This is not good, Keefe.
Speak of this no more.

10:13.374 --> 10:15.751
This kind of talk makes
my a-hole burn.

10:15.751 --> 10:19.337
I hate to think I'm responsible
for your a-hole burning, brother.

10:24.218 --> 10:26.804
Learn to paint while
you drink fine wines?

10:26.804 --> 10:29.557
You always know about
the coolest activities, Lollipop.

10:29.557 --> 10:32.268
Well, BJ, your wife is
one of the cools.

10:32.268 --> 10:35.521
So cool.
Do you like my painting?

10:38.149 --> 10:41.318
- Is that your cock?
- He's my childhood pet, Rags.

10:41.318 --> 10:43.863
Is Rags an explosive diarrhea
that you named?

10:43.863 --> 10:45.489
He was my dog.

10:45.489 --> 10:50.201
I never got the pleasure to meet Rags,
so that's why I don't recognize him.

11:04.216 --> 11:08.178
It's just my gyno's office.
They're just like texting me

11:08.178 --> 11:11.056
about a routine
"holes and folds" checkup.

11:16.269 --> 11:18.229
Stephen:
"Text me back or else."

11:19.607 --> 11:20.982
Another one?

11:21.357 --> 11:23.985
They sent it twice. Robots.

11:26.113 --> 11:29.866
So annoying they would send it twice.
I already got the appointment.

11:34.037 --> 11:37.665
Somebody sent me a dick pic.
I better text this guy back,

11:37.665 --> 11:40.044
let him know he's got
the wrong recipient.

11:40.044 --> 11:41.879
No. BJ, just block it.

11:41.879 --> 11:44.798
But some lucky gal is missing out
on that glorious cock shot.

11:44.798 --> 11:46.925
BJ, that's a perv, okay?

11:46.925 --> 11:49.845
That's like an old-school dude
in a raincoat trying to flash people

11:49.845 --> 11:51.806
to get his rocks off.

11:51.806 --> 11:53.848
Okay. There. It's blocked.

11:55.225 --> 11:57.060
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:00.730 --> 12:02.023
"Told ya."

12:05.944 --> 12:07.822
Geez Louise,
what was that all about?

12:07.822 --> 12:11.242
I'm just trying to do a panes of glass.
You know what I mean?

12:11.242 --> 12:13.243
It was just like constant
medical checks.

12:13.243 --> 12:18.456
How can somebody have a good time
with her husband? Let's paint and sip.

12:22.127 --> 12:25.338
The cape shall embrace you
like the arms of Jesus Christ.

12:25.965 --> 12:28.508
You wear it in celebration of his love.

12:33.514 --> 12:36.017
The pistol gives the power to take life.

12:36.767 --> 12:39.395
The Lord gave us free will
to do what we choose.

12:39.811 --> 12:45.692
It is a righteous man who wears
the pistol yet does no evil.

12:45.692 --> 12:49.780
Jesse Gemstone,
under the eyes of God,

12:50.573 --> 12:54.785
you are hereby inducted into
the Cape and Pistol Society.

13:12.302 --> 13:14.763
Congrats, Jesse.
A made man.

13:14.763 --> 13:18.391
That's right. Finally a part of
the Cape and motherfucking Pistol.

13:18.391 --> 13:21.394
Jesse, we don't talk like that
in Cape and Pistol.

13:21.394 --> 13:24.231
- You all don't do cuss words?
- No.

13:24.231 --> 13:26.900
My bad. Thanks for keeping me
in the dark on that one, Daddy.

13:27.275 --> 13:31.946
Anyway, it was a long ride but I knew,
eventually, I would make it to the top.

13:31.946 --> 13:33.699
Of course, you knew.

13:33.699 --> 13:36.659
Isn't that some kind of a given
for somebody like you?

13:36.659 --> 13:37.912
I'm sorry. How so?

13:37.912 --> 13:40.413
Well, maybe because you're
Eli Gemstone's son.

13:40.413 --> 13:42.875
Maybe that's got something
to do with it.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.169
I earned this on my own merits.

13:45.169 --> 13:47.546
I run one of the largest churches
in the entire country.

13:47.546 --> 13:49.964
So stop tripping, buddy.
Tell him, Daddy.

13:49.964 --> 13:53.177
Of course, you learned it.
Just settle down, Jesse.

13:53.177 --> 13:58.641
Dr. Gemstone's running defense.
I love it. Just making an observation.

13:59.141 --> 14:02.352
- Wee, wee, sucker.
- Don't you wee, wee, sucker me.

14:02.770 --> 14:06.523
You have appeared to have gotten
some sort of ass-whooping.

14:06.523 --> 14:10.611
That's correct. Didn't rob me
or nothing. Just beat me.

14:10.944 --> 14:14.572
- And the cops don't know who did it.
- No, they don't.

14:14.572 --> 14:18.076
I just thank the Lord that my sister
and brother weren't around.

14:18.076 --> 14:22.081
Just somebody who is trying to
teach you a lesson in particular.

14:22.081 --> 14:24.874
Maybe somebody you crossed
or were very rude to or something.

14:24.874 --> 14:26.709
- I don't know.
- Well, I'm not so sure.

14:26.709 --> 14:28.378
I am.
I'm sure.

14:31.048 --> 14:33.801
- This bread is the fucking tits.
- Excuse me.

14:34.468 --> 14:36.679
You're not supposed to cuss
in Cape and Pistol.

14:36.679 --> 14:39.056
Yeah. No fucking dude.
My daddy already told me.

14:39.056 --> 14:42.851
It's a talent.
A level of respect we show each other.

14:42.851 --> 14:44.603
Show some respect, Jesse.

14:44.603 --> 14:49.107
Profanity in the chambers.
A white slap shall be issued.

14:49.107 --> 14:51.484
White slap?
What the fuck is that?

15:45.373 --> 15:50.502
Jesse Gemstone. Jesse, I'm here.
Hang on now.

15:51.128 --> 15:52.797
What the fuck are you doing?

15:52.797 --> 15:59.470
Hey, what you think? I made it in.
I heard you is being sworn in today.

16:01.138 --> 16:03.349
Well, come on now.
Let me in. Hook me up.

16:03.349 --> 16:05.726
This is a secret society.
You can't just roll up in.

16:05.726 --> 16:11.023
It ain't a secret if I heard about it.
If you ain't gonna make Baba Bonkers,

16:11.023 --> 16:13.901
maybe some of these other
influential Christians will.

16:13.901 --> 16:17.405
None of Cape and Pistol are gonna
give a fuck about Baba Bonkers.

16:17.405 --> 16:21.492
Boy, I watched you become a man,
but don't think

16:21.492 --> 16:25.203
I won't bend you over my knee
and turn that fat ass red now.

16:25.203 --> 16:29.624
I'd love to see you turn this
big, fat ass red.

16:30.459 --> 16:32.795
I'll give you 20 bucks to try
and see what happens.

16:32.795 --> 16:36.673
I don't need $20 to kick your ass.
Let's go. I'll show you right now.

16:36.673 --> 16:40.011
What you gonna do, you fucking old
man? Get the fuck off.

16:41.344 --> 16:44.764
Go back inside your little
fucking Mickey Mouse club now.

16:46.015 --> 16:48.728
- Goddamn Harry Potter wannabes.
- No, we're not.

16:48.728 --> 16:54.442
You're so hell-bent on running
this church the way your daddy did.

16:55.316 --> 16:58.904
Only problem is, Jesse Gemstone,
you ain't your fucking daddy.

16:58.904 --> 17:01.656
What did my daddy had that
made him so fucking special?

17:01.656 --> 17:07.912
He had a star by his side, your mama.
You ain't got that. What you got?

17:07.912 --> 17:13.586
- You got you and two not really stars.
- Actually, that is kind of the reality.

17:13.586 --> 17:16.296
Ain't no kind of about it, Jesse.
If you wanna capture the magic,

17:16.296 --> 17:20.634
you need your mama,
and I can give it to you now.

17:20.634 --> 17:22.845
What are you gonna do,
dress up like her?

17:22.845 --> 17:25.473
I ain't nobody gonna
put on no female clothes.

17:26.098 --> 17:30.436
I'm talking about resurrection.
Bringing her back to life.

17:30.811 --> 17:34.482
Uncle Baby Billy, I don't know what
you're smoking but I ain't buying it.

17:34.482 --> 17:37.735
No one in our family trusts you.
I ain't about to start.

17:38.318 --> 17:42.197
Thanks for coming by and giving me
congratulations on my induct-ments.

17:42.864 --> 17:47.661
Resurrection, boy, from the ashes
in fulfillment of the scriptures.

17:47.661 --> 17:50.413
Put it back on that stage.
Restore the kingdom.

17:51.039 --> 17:53.875
Come see me when
you're ready to believe in miracles!

18:11.059 --> 18:12.812
What the hell was that?

18:13.895 --> 18:17.942
You got pocket gophers. We're just doing
a little pest control for you.

18:17.942 --> 18:19.777
It sounded like a bomb went off.

18:19.777 --> 18:23.489
We made a little homemade explosive
with some fertilizer, some gas.

18:23.822 --> 18:27.034
One more, we've cleared out
the whole den for you.

18:27.034 --> 18:29.536
You know we got a ground crew
for that kind of stuff.

18:29.536 --> 18:33.624
We know.
But they ain't half as good as we are.

18:34.290 --> 18:37.419
Plus, we just wanna show you
we appreciate all you've done for us.

18:37.419 --> 18:41.382
I appreciate the thought. I'm proud of
the way you stood up to your daddy.

18:41.382 --> 18:45.553
I know it wasn't easy.
We're happy you all are here.

18:49.431 --> 18:50.724
Here it goes.

18:55.813 --> 18:57.857
- You got scared.
- No, I didn't.

18:58.982 --> 19:02.402
- You see any gophers?
- Not no more.

19:04.028 --> 19:06.823
Parents of teens, good to see you all.

19:08.993 --> 19:11.786
This is a good turnout. Very cool.

19:12.163 --> 19:17.126
So I just wanted to address some
of the letters I received in the SBC.

19:19.712 --> 19:21.797
That is suggestion box comments.

19:22.131 --> 19:25.760
The issue is simple. We do not feel
safe with the assistant youth pastor.

19:25.760 --> 19:29.972
- We heard he's a devil worshiper.
- That's false. Fake news.

19:29.972 --> 19:32.682
No, Keefe is an ex-Satan worshiper.

19:33.017 --> 19:37.521
I don't judge people's past. I used to
sell fireworks on the side of the road.

19:37.521 --> 19:41.191
But I don't want him
influencing our children.

19:41.191 --> 19:43.276
You don't have to worry
about Keefe around children.

19:43.276 --> 19:47.615
I vouch for him. He is one of my closest
personal friends. He is my dude.

19:47.615 --> 19:52.536
With all the rumors swirling about you,
can't you see how strange this looks?

19:54.872 --> 19:58.793
- There's rumors swirling about me?
- Remove him or we remove our kids.

20:00.585 --> 20:07.550
Okay. Thank you for your feedback.
Enjoy your Woks On Water.

20:13.556 --> 20:16.769
I was hoping Thomas would be here
today. He's my usual partner.

20:16.769 --> 20:19.689
Someone slashed all his tires.
He can't make it.

20:20.022 --> 20:23.483
- Well, that's disturbing.
- We need to find you a new partner.

20:24.151 --> 20:25.527
I'll play.

20:30.573 --> 20:35.703
BJ, right? Didn't recognize you.
You're always in a suit in church.

20:35.703 --> 20:38.791
Well, don't let the
Versace couture fool you. It's still me.

20:41.043 --> 20:44.964
- So you go to Salvation Center?
- I do. I'm Steven.

20:45.297 --> 20:49.176
- I actually work with your lady.
- Nice! She's a lot of fun, right?

20:51.094 --> 20:55.849
- Is she ever? Should we rock out?
- Yeah. Let's rock out.

20:55.849 --> 20:59.227
Although, I think pickleball
is a little bit more like jazz.

21:01.188 --> 21:06.569
It feels good. Get the blood flowing.
Lately, it's been rushing to my cock.

21:06.985 --> 21:08.738
- Oh, for real?
- Yeah, bro.

21:09.112 --> 21:13.575
I've been hooking up with this chick,
so hot. Horniest gal I've ever met.

21:13.575 --> 21:15.910
You should see
how wet her pussy gets.

21:15.910 --> 21:19.748
I touch her and it's just
instantly fucking dripping.

21:22.917 --> 21:28.299
- Fucking full-on rainfalls.
- Well, thanks for filling in.

21:29.215 --> 21:30.843
I'm filling in all right.

21:30.843 --> 21:33.721
I just meant that my usual team mate,
Thomas, isn't here today.

21:33.721 --> 21:36.640
I'm talking about how, hopefully,
I'll be filling in this chick's pussy.

21:36.640 --> 21:38.976
I dry-humped her till I came.

21:38.976 --> 21:42.646
Had the fucking map
of Hawaiian Islands all down my slacks.

21:42.979 --> 21:44.940
Time out, you guys.
Time out.

21:46.399 --> 21:49.904
Steven, I have to say,
I find what you're saying offensive.

21:49.904 --> 21:51.279
Do you?

21:51.279 --> 21:54.075
I don't really enjoy poontang talk
with other fellas.

21:54.075 --> 21:57.827
I know it's seen as locker room chat
but I find it to be disrespectful.

22:02.582 --> 22:07.962
- You're a weak little fag, ain't you?
- No. I'm a straight cis male.

22:07.962 --> 22:12.175
But I don't believe that queer people
should be referenced that way.

22:14.219 --> 22:17.597
You fellas gonna play pickleball
or keep flapping them gums?

22:27.065 --> 22:28.442
I love her, you dick!

22:33.698 --> 22:38.743
Henry. You're bleeding so much.
Is he on blood thinners?

22:46.126 --> 22:48.628
They said Jesus struggled
with the crossword.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.589
He always got stuck at two across.

22:55.427 --> 22:58.931
- You're going to hell, Eli.
- Maybe not today. It's too nice out.

22:59.724 --> 23:05.187
Yeah, it is pretty here in the garden.
I can see why Aimee-Leigh liked it.

23:05.187 --> 23:08.690
I thought it was a bad thing
to treat yourself nice, is it?

23:09.065 --> 23:13.320
Yeah, I could never live like you do.
All the things you have.

23:15.530 --> 23:17.574
I was never jealous of your riches.

23:19.618 --> 23:22.287
But I am jealous that
your kids still love you.

23:23.288 --> 23:25.791
That's more than
I can say about my own.

23:25.791 --> 23:31.881
Don't mistake love for dependency.
I feel like one of them old dogs

23:31.881 --> 23:35.468
with swollen nipples you see on a
ranch searching for shade.

23:36.260 --> 23:38.304
You look like one too.

23:39.220 --> 23:43.892
It's been three years since those boys
played their instruments for me.

23:44.268 --> 23:47.353
They refused to because
they know it gives me joy.

23:47.353 --> 23:50.900
- That's how much they hate me.
- They don't hate you, May-May.

23:52.109 --> 23:58.199
- You're just hard to love sometimes.
- Gave them everything I could.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.078
The problem is I never had
a damn thing.

24:08.626 --> 24:13.506
We are here to discuss when people
think people might be molesting people.

24:14.172 --> 24:18.719
- Keefe's gotta go, Kelvin.
- What? Okay.

24:19.512 --> 24:22.640
I can't even believe what I'm hearing.
Fire Keefe?

24:22.640 --> 24:24.975
He just can't be
assistant youth pastor anymore.

24:24.975 --> 24:27.977
Martin thinks there might be a place for
him in immigrant outreach.

24:27.977 --> 24:31.106
Okay.
I like working with Keefe closely.

24:31.565 --> 24:34.484
- Okay.
- He'll be so crushed.

24:34.484 --> 24:38.239
Think about your own family's feelings
for once instead of Keefe's!

24:38.572 --> 24:40.366
Do you know what
it feels like to be me

24:40.366 --> 24:43.744
who fucking makes sacrifices right
and left to run this shit?

24:43.744 --> 24:47.580
Why are you acting like you're
the only one doing stuff? We all do!

24:47.580 --> 24:49.874
The stuff that your friend is doing,
the molesting

24:49.874 --> 24:53.421
or whatever the fuck is going on there,
that is not good for the church.

24:53.421 --> 24:56.215
Church leaders gotta think
about optics, Kelvin.

24:56.215 --> 25:00.552
- You need to suck it up, homie.
- Like you sucked it up on tour?

25:01.594 --> 25:03.680
How fucking dare you?

25:04.013 --> 25:06.307
- You two.
- I'm gonna fuck you up.

25:06.307 --> 25:08.811
- Both of you, enough.
- Fucker. I'm gonna get you.

25:08.811 --> 25:09.895
Enough!

25:10.938 --> 25:14.984
No, Jesse. No, son. I don't like that.
I don't like you acting like daddy.

25:14.984 --> 25:18.528
I don't like how you're both acting,
like little immature babies. Sit down.

25:19.612 --> 25:21.574
I'm sitting down 'cause I want to.

25:21.574 --> 25:26.746
This isn't fair and I think you all know
that. Martin, you got anything to say?

25:27.120 --> 25:29.331
Life is not fair.

25:29.331 --> 25:33.044
And Keefe as assistant youth pastor
does not work.

25:34.045 --> 25:36.964
This is not the hill to die on, Kelvin.
I'm sorry.

25:39.883 --> 25:44.305
I'm just getting my coffee. I'm leaving.
I vote no on everything else today.

25:44.305 --> 25:47.766
The next thing we're gonna vote for was
funding the battered women's shelter.

25:47.766 --> 25:49.143
It's a no.

25:51.228 --> 25:54.522
Ran into your coworker Steven
at the pickleball court.

25:54.522 --> 25:57.777
- Pardon?
- Steven. Spikey hair man from music.

25:58.234 --> 26:01.029
What's up with him? What did he say?
What did he want?

26:01.029 --> 26:05.034
We played as a team but it was strange.
He started doing graphic sex talk.

26:05.409 --> 26:08.287
I didn't really get on board.
I kind of upset him.

26:08.287 --> 26:11.123
What kind of graphic sex talk?
That's so weird.

26:11.123 --> 26:14.125
Explicit descriptions of sex acts
he'd done with a woman.

26:14.125 --> 26:18.089
How her vaginal secretions
made full puddles on the ground.

26:18.463 --> 26:22.425
How she liked it when he shot into
his own trousers, was kind of gross.

26:22.802 --> 26:25.261
I said, "No, thanks."
He lashed out at me.

26:25.261 --> 26:29.350
The dude's a sicko, BJ.
He's got major problems in his brain.

26:29.350 --> 26:32.560
- That's why he got fired.
- Steven got fired? What for?

26:32.560 --> 26:35.438
I don't know. It was like
a time's up me too type deal.

26:35.772 --> 26:39.943
That's why he was so prickly with
me. He's upset he lost his job.

26:40.611 --> 26:41.986
I should call him.

26:42.321 --> 26:45.865
What? No! Don't you dare do that.
Just leave it alone.

26:45.865 --> 26:48.869
Sometimes when men boasts,
they're really just insecure.

26:48.869 --> 26:51.162
Stop trying to figure this dude out.

26:51.706 --> 26:55.918
You are a good guy. He is
a very bad guy. That's it.

26:55.918 --> 27:00.089
- I didn't know you felt so strongly.
- I don't know.

27:00.840 --> 27:03.091
I feel like the opposite of strongly.

27:03.091 --> 27:05.886
Don't give a shit whether
the dude lives or dies.

27:05.886 --> 27:10.850
I lean toward hoping he dies today.
But, also, I could care less.

27:22.152 --> 27:26.281
Look who it is.
It's your favorite cousin Jesse.

27:27.115 --> 27:30.619
Big, bad Jesse.
You ready for a miracle?

27:41.338 --> 27:43.965
Nephew, prepare yourself.

27:53.851 --> 27:55.394
Here she comes.

28:31.679 --> 28:34.266
Hey, buddy.
What you working on?

28:34.975 --> 28:38.478
I'm fashioning pieces of
construction paper into crosses

28:38.478 --> 28:42.732
for the youth group bulletin board,
but they keep coming out like daggers.

28:43.317 --> 28:45.026
I'm sure it's fine, Keefe.

28:46.987 --> 28:53.953
I have to talk to you about something,
and it's not easy to talk about.

28:55.203 --> 28:57.038
- Sexual stuff?
- No.

28:59.624 --> 29:02.752
We're gonna move you out
of youth group. But guess what?

29:02.752 --> 29:05.214
I got you a gig
in immigrant outreach.

29:05.214 --> 29:07.924
You're finally gonna get
to use your Cantonese.

29:07.924 --> 29:11.928
Hen ku.
That means very cool. I looked it up.

29:13.305 --> 29:18.393
I understand. I'm sorry
for the trouble I brought upon you.

29:18.393 --> 29:20.729
You were no trouble.
You saved me

29:22.231 --> 29:25.860
and I will walk the righteous path
from here on out because of you.

29:25.860 --> 29:27.445
It's time to take what I've learned

29:27.445 --> 29:32.324
and put it to good use,
alone, by myself.

29:32.324 --> 29:34.702
No, Keefe.
We're just shifting your position.

29:34.702 --> 29:38.372
I need to give you space that
the air can be cleared.

29:38.831 --> 29:41.751
- I don't want space.
- I'll move out.

29:42.167 --> 29:47.797
This is a big decision. Take your time.
You should pray on it.

29:48.381 --> 29:50.175
I'll be out tomorrow.

29:51.176 --> 29:55.889
You Gemstones were stars
destined to burn bright.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.477
Best I step aside.

30:06.942 --> 30:08.193
Keefe.

30:20.498 --> 30:21.665
Hey, sexy!

30:28.546 --> 30:31.633
- So you're stalking my husband now?
- I told you I wouldn't give up.

30:31.633 --> 30:36.722
Hey, Steven, you gave it the college
try. But my decision stands.

30:36.722 --> 30:41.477
This is never gonna happen.
It's a mistake I never should have made.

30:41.477 --> 30:44.313
- I love BJ.
- I hate Christie.

30:44.313 --> 30:47.023
I wish I could chop her head off
while she's making omelets.

30:47.023 --> 30:48.608
- Okay. Do it.
- I would.

30:48.608 --> 30:52.529
Whatever you do, I need you to respect
my wishes and stop harassing me.

30:52.529 --> 30:55.741
Harassing you?
You want me, Judy.

30:55.741 --> 30:59.203
No, boy. If I wanted you,
I would have you.

30:59.870 --> 31:03.164
I'm just doing what I thought you're
supposed to do when you're a rock star.

31:03.498 --> 31:08.420
I thought, "people wanna fall in love
with me, suck my dick, so be it."

31:09.421 --> 31:13.467
It turns out I'm not Daniel Le Roux.
I'm Judy Gemstone.

31:13.842 --> 31:19.556
I'm BJ Barnes' bitch and no one else's.
You're not half the man that he is.

31:22.267 --> 31:25.980
- It's funny you should mention him.
- Judy, what are you doing here?

31:27.897 --> 31:31.276
Called my old pickleball partner here
to bury the hatchet.

31:31.736 --> 31:37.532
See... I can't stand
all this lying anymore.

31:38.242 --> 31:40.286
Exhausting to live that way.

31:42.787 --> 31:48.752
So... do you wanna
tell him the truth, Judy,

31:50.171 --> 31:51.756
or do I have to?

32:01.347 --> 32:04.642
- Hi, Mama.
- What's going on? Who died?

32:05.018 --> 32:08.146
We just thought that
we'd play our music for you.

32:10.482 --> 32:14.027
We're gonna play Sinner You Better
Get Ready. Your favorite.

32:18.239 --> 32:19.909
Two, three, four.

32:34.799 --> 32:40.846
Sinner, you better get ready.
O, you better get ready, halleluia.

32:41.221 --> 32:47.019
Sinner, you better get ready.
Time's comin' when the sinner must die.

32:49.605 --> 32:52.233
O, sinner man, you better pray.

32:52.733 --> 32:55.819
Time's a-comin'
when the sinner must die.

32:55.819 --> 33:00.198
Get prepared for your judgment day...

33:00.532 --> 33:03.160
- Pontius, what the fuck?
- Get the fuck out!

33:05.329 --> 33:08.248
Put your fucking pants on
and come to my office.

33:11.001 --> 33:13.379
About to be burned
in the flames of hell.

33:13.963 --> 33:16.549
Time's comin'
when the sinner must die.

33:19.135 --> 33:21.929
We were horny, so we fucked.
Big whoop.

33:22.304 --> 33:25.807
It is a big whoop, Pontius.
You're my son. I'm head of the church.

33:25.807 --> 33:27.184
Co-head.

33:27.184 --> 33:30.145
All right. You know what?
I was gonna be cool but fuck that.

33:30.145 --> 33:32.398
The reason why Michaela was allowed
to come to this house

33:32.398 --> 33:35.400
is because we trust you.
But if you're gonna sit there

33:35.400 --> 33:38.862
and put jism on her behind our backs
then you can kiss that trust goodbye.

33:39.238 --> 33:44.033
Trust is a gift that should
be cherished. Life is tough.

33:44.033 --> 33:46.369
When you allow yourself
to trust another person

33:46.369 --> 33:48.163
that takes some of the weight off.

33:48.163 --> 33:51.791
And that's why it stings extra
when that trust is betrayed.

33:56.838 --> 34:00.509
People do not like having the rug
pulled out from underneath them.

34:01.344 --> 34:04.680
Love can be lost.
Relationships can be damaged forever.

34:04.680 --> 34:09.393
It can take years and years to mend
all that wasted fucking time.

34:09.851 --> 34:13.438
Trust is the only thing keeping
the entire house of cards standing.

34:13.438 --> 34:17.485
Without it, we're left with a shit
stained world full of liars and cheats.

34:20.028 --> 34:24.407
Somebody gifting you their trust is
a very powerful thing.

34:25.034 --> 34:27.285
So breaking that trust is
the equivalent of saying,

34:27.285 --> 34:30.955
"Hey, buddy, fuck you. I don't
give a fuck about what you think".

34:32.540 --> 34:35.877
Is that what you want? Is that what you
wanna portray to me and your mom?

34:35.877 --> 34:39.965
"Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. Fuck you. I don't
give a fuck about what you think."

34:39.965 --> 34:43.594
Someone saying fuck you to family
will not be tolerated in this house.

34:43.927 --> 34:46.346
As your father,
have I made myself clear?

34:46.888 --> 34:49.600
Yeah. Whatever.

34:59.651 --> 35:00.902
We love you, Mama.

35:00.902 --> 35:02.487
That's for you, Mama.

35:06.866 --> 35:09.120
You proud, Pa? We do good?

35:09.536 --> 35:11.830
Five thousand pounds
of ammonium nitrate.

35:11.830 --> 35:15.418
You stick that up Uncle Sam's ass
and bull him straight to Mars.

35:17.002 --> 35:20.881
Yes, you did good, boys.

35:24.010 --> 35:25.468
You did real good.

35:30.640 --> 35:33.810
