00:00.468 --> 00:01.300
ADULT ADAM: <i> Back in the day,</i>

00:01.302 --> 00:03.602
<i> winter break</i>
<i> was my favorite time of year.</i>

00:03.604 --> 00:05.437
<i> The hot cocoa,</i>
<i> the gift-wrapping,</i>

00:05.439 --> 00:06.372
<i> the taste of buttery popcorn</i>

00:06.374 --> 00:08.340
<i> as you watched</i>
<i> your favorite holiday movie.</i>

00:08.342 --> 00:11.377
<i> For me and my big bro,</i>
<i> it was</i> A Christmas Story.

00:11.379 --> 00:13.278
<i> For some reason,</i>
<i> it just spoke to us.</i>

00:13.280 --> 00:16.615
<i> The Sox traded bullfrog,</i>
<i> the only player they got,</i>

00:16.617 --> 00:17.216
<i> for Shottenhoffen.</i>

00:17.218 --> 00:21.153
The Phils are trading
Ryne Sandberg for Larry Bowa!

00:21.155 --> 00:22.154
It's ludicrous!

00:22.156 --> 00:23.522
<i> Ralphie!</i>
<i> On the double!</i>

00:23.524 --> 00:25.324
Everybody get your asses
in here!

00:25.326 --> 00:28.293
<i> We didn't do Christmas,</i>
<i> but we had Hanukkah.</i>

00:28.295 --> 00:30.496
<i> And that meant</i>
<i> lots of forced family time</i>

00:30.498 --> 00:32.431
<i> and Eastern European foods.</i>

00:32.433 --> 00:34.566
Gah!
What's that smell?

00:34.568 --> 00:35.167
Lucky, not cool!

00:35.169 --> 00:37.436
ADULT ADAM: <i> But it wasn't</i>
<i> the dog. It was this.</i>

00:37.438 --> 00:38.203
Stuffed cabbage time!

00:38.205 --> 00:40.205
Let's go!
It's freakin' Hanukkah!

00:40.207 --> 00:42.207
Again?
Didn't we just do that?

00:42.209 --> 00:43.642
Yeah, last year.
Go set the table.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.310
ADULT ADAM: <i> A lot of people</i>
<i> think that because there are</i>

00:45.312 --> 00:48.213
<i> eight nights of Hanukkah,</i>
<i> you get eight awesome</i>
<i> presents.</i>

00:48.215 --> 00:50.816
<i> Truth is,</i>
<i> they were mostly filler.</i>

00:50.818 --> 00:51.483
Shoelaces.

00:51.485 --> 00:52.918
Batteries.
Underpants.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.119
I got to go.
I got a thing.

00:54.121 --> 00:56.655
ADULT ADAM: <i> As the days</i>
<i> stretched on,</i>
<i> so were the limits</i>

00:56.657 --> 00:58.891
<i> of what was considered</i>
<i> a present.</i>

00:58.893 --> 00:59.792
School supplies.

00:59.794 --> 01:01.226
Raisins.
Underpants.

01:01.228 --> 01:01.994
I got to go.
I got a thing.

01:01.996 --> 01:05.731
ADULT ADAM: <i> By night 8,</i>
<i> it was straight-up bottom</i>
<i> of the barrel.</i>

01:05.733 --> 01:06.498
Toothbrush.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.168
Zit cream?
More underpants?

01:09.170 --> 01:10.235
What is the deal, people?

01:10.237 --> 01:13.372
Zit cream isn't a gift!
It's an insult!

01:13.374 --> 01:14.373
I'm gonna go.
I got a...

01:14.375 --> 01:17.276
Thing. We know.
You've got a thing.

01:17.278 --> 01:20.079
And your new underpants
are a gift for me, Barry.

01:20.081 --> 01:21.814
ADULT ADAM: <i> Even if we didn't</i>
<i> have the holiday spirit,</i>

01:21.816 --> 01:23.782
<i> we tried our best</i>
<i> to make it fun.</i>

01:23.784 --> 01:26.318
What the hell happened
to all the sour cream?

01:26.320 --> 01:27.086
Adam dared me.

01:27.088 --> 01:29.421
I ate it, along with
the rest of the condiments.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.323
In your face,
mustards and jams!

01:31.325 --> 01:33.992
What is the one rule
we have in this house, huh?

01:33.994 --> 01:35.727
No daring Barry
to do stupid stuff.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.063
Why?
'Cause I have no regard
for my personal well-being.

01:38.065 --> 01:41.333
ADULT ADAM: <i> Frankly, for us,</i>
<i> it wasn't the most</i>
<i> joyous holiday,</i>

01:41.335 --> 01:44.369
<i> especially after visiting</i>
<i> the Christmas wonderland</i>

01:44.371 --> 01:45.237
<i> at the Kremps'.</i>

01:45.239 --> 01:47.172
Daisy,
it's the Goldbergs!

01:47.174 --> 01:48.874
(BABY VOICE)
Hello, Goldbergs.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.410
(LAUGHS)
We've been expecting you!

01:51.412 --> 01:54.580
Merry Chris...
Holiday.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.949
Winter fest.

01:56.951 --> 01:57.683
Welcome!

01:57.685 --> 01:59.284
Oh, uh,
Charles is out back

01:59.286 --> 02:00.786
splitting wood
for the Yule fire.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.154
Do you want
to give him a hand, Murray?

02:02.156 --> 02:03.422
He's good.
I believe in him.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.991
Can I wet your whistle
with some eggnog?

02:05.993 --> 02:06.992
Don't forget
your cinnamon stick.

02:06.994 --> 02:09.394
Be careful.
Scott is our college boy,

02:09.396 --> 02:10.429
and he makes
a strong nog.

02:10.431 --> 02:13.165
Mom? Did you finally give me
that BB gun I always wanted?

02:13.167 --> 02:14.967
Oh, this is a snare drum,
isn't it?

02:14.969 --> 02:16.635
I told you,
no peeking, okay?

02:16.637 --> 02:20.139
I want the two of you back to
icing that gingerbread house.

02:20.141 --> 02:22.508
Chad,
put down the snare drum.

02:22.510 --> 02:23.709
I knew it!

02:23.711 --> 02:24.710
He gets me every year.

02:24.712 --> 02:27.412
Okay, what are my eyes
looking at?

02:27.414 --> 02:29.581
Nothing. They're just excited
for Kremp Christmas.

02:29.583 --> 02:33.685
But why are your kids here,
willingly participating?

02:33.687 --> 02:35.287
What else are they gonna do?
Seriously?

02:35.289 --> 02:37.089
You mean to tell me
you're that good at family?

02:37.091 --> 02:38.724
Good at family?
That's not a saying.

02:38.726 --> 02:41.693
Oh, it's a saying,
and you are good at family.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.128
You are good at family.

02:43.130 --> 02:43.996
We're fine at family.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.631
You're fab at family.
We're not.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.299
It's been fun. It has.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.834
Let's do it again
sometime.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.136
Uh, but let's not make a plan.
We'll wing it.

02:51.138 --> 02:52.337
Oh, Murray,
before you go,

02:52.339 --> 02:54.806
I have the teensiest of favors
to ask you.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.175
Our Santa fell through
this year,

02:56.177 --> 02:58.010
and it would just
mean the world to us

02:58.012 --> 03:01.480
if you could just pop over
and hand out some gifts.

03:01.482 --> 03:04.716
Thank you so much
for thinking of him.

03:04.718 --> 03:05.951
He'd love to.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.886
Murray,
you'll put on the suit.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.288
Or...

03:12.760 --> 03:13.792
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

03:13.794 --> 03:18.297
<i> ¶ But nonetheless,</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

03:20.434 --> 03:21.166
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

03:21.168 --> 03:25.037
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

03:25.039 --> 03:28.507
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It was December 23,</i>
<i> 1980-something.</i>

03:28.509 --> 03:29.141
<i> Christmas vacation.</i>

03:29.143 --> 03:31.944
<i> That meant my brother's</i>
<i> dopey friends were</i>
<i> out of town,</i>

03:31.946 --> 03:33.378
<i> and I was his only playmate.</i>

03:33.380 --> 03:35.314
<i> The alone time with Barry</i>
<i> was awesome!</i>

03:35.316 --> 03:39.251
<i> It's how we came up with</i>
<i> our favorite brotherly game,</i>
<i> ball ball.</i>

03:39.253 --> 03:41.286
<i> There were hundreds of rules,</i>
<i> but the most important</i>

03:41.288 --> 03:44.356
<i> was every time you took</i>
<i> a shot, you had to yell...</i>

03:44.358 --> 03:45.290
Ball ball!

03:45.292 --> 03:47.359
Ball ball!
Ball ball!

03:47.361 --> 03:48.260
Whoo!

03:48.262 --> 03:49.261
Nine points.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.495
I win. Suck it!

03:50.497 --> 03:51.330
Looks like
the trophy is mine.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.298
Damn it!
You cheated!
Rematch!

03:53.300 --> 03:56.835
ADULT ADAM: <i> It was days</i>
<i> and days of bro-ing out</i>
<i> with Barry.</i>

03:56.837 --> 03:57.469
You ready, Barry?

03:57.471 --> 04:00.239
You better be, 'cause
we're about to play some...

04:00.241 --> 04:01.306
Ball ball!
Ball ball!

04:01.308 --> 04:03.842
Ball ball!
Yes! 10 points.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.110
What the hell is this?

04:05.112 --> 04:06.111
(CHUCKLES)
It's called ball ball.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.547
It's this awesome game
where you throw the ball
back and forth...

04:08.549 --> 04:10.882
I'm familiar
with the game.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.251
I helped invent it.

04:12.253 --> 04:14.419
I added
the second "ball."

04:14.421 --> 04:16.955
And I'm the official
World Champion.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.524
Yeah, we don't recognize
that federation anymore.

04:19.526 --> 04:22.794
Lainey and I now play for
Champion of the Universe!

04:22.796 --> 04:24.396
I didn't ratify
these changes.

04:24.398 --> 04:25.797
Adam, it's fine.
You can play.

04:25.799 --> 04:28.300
No! The ball ball he knew
is over.

04:28.302 --> 04:29.768
Plus, I wouldn't even
be able to explain

04:29.770 --> 04:32.537
all the changes we made
in the past 10 minutes.

04:32.806 --> 04:33.872
Whatever.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.107
Enjoy your stupid game.

04:35.109 --> 04:36.275
ADULT ADAM:
<i> While I was losing Barry,</i>

04:36.277 --> 04:40.178
<i> my mom was gonna win over</i>
<i> our family with a new</i>
<i> holiday plan.</i>

04:40.180 --> 04:41.280
Big news, everyone.

04:41.282 --> 04:45.083
This family's about to
experience some exciting
changes

04:45.085 --> 04:45.817
this holiday season.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.287
If it costs me money,
it ain't happening.

04:48.289 --> 04:49.655
It'll actually
save you money.

04:49.657 --> 04:50.789
It's happening.
In the long run.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.292
In the short run,
it'll cost way more.

04:53.294 --> 04:53.825
(GROANS)

04:53.827 --> 04:56.261
I just got back from
the Kremps', and guess what.

04:56.263 --> 04:59.164
There are people out there
who actually enjoy

04:59.166 --> 05:01.533
celebrating the holidays
together. (CHUCKLES)

05:01.535 --> 05:05.404
Turns out, it's not that
we're not good at family.

05:05.406 --> 05:08.106
It's just that we've been
doing it all wrong.

05:08.108 --> 05:11.376
So this year,
we're gonna spice things up

05:11.378 --> 05:15.080
with a little celebration
I like to call...

05:15.516 --> 05:17.115
Super Hanukkah!

05:17.117 --> 05:19.751
Whoo! Mama's jazzed,
and here's why.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.254
We're gonna make Hanukkah
sizzle and pop!

05:22.256 --> 05:23.355
We're gonna
decorate the house.

05:23.357 --> 05:24.956
We're gonna drink
buttery booze milk

05:24.958 --> 05:28.226
and put all our gifts
under a festive topiary

05:28.228 --> 05:30.729
together
as one big family.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.164
So, like a
Christmas tree?

05:32.166 --> 05:33.398
No! A Hanukkah bush!

05:33.400 --> 05:36.101
And instead of opening
presents on eight
separate nights,

05:36.103 --> 05:39.971
we're gonna save 'em up
and open 'em all on
one night!

05:39.973 --> 05:41.239
Or one morning.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.708
So, like
Christmas morning?

05:42.710 --> 05:44.476
No,
super Hanukkah morning.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.877
But you better not
be naughty,

05:45.879 --> 05:49.047
or else you-know-who
won't bring you any presents.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.115
Santa Claus!

05:50.117 --> 05:51.249
No!
Hanukkah Harry.

05:51.251 --> 05:54.186
The Jon Lovitz character
from <i> Saturday Night Live?</i>

05:54.188 --> 05:56.388
Actually, he's based on
a real person.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.423
Don't look it up!
Who has the time?

05:58.425 --> 05:59.224
Just trust me on this.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.626
Well, I'm all for getting this
over with in one night.

06:01.628 --> 06:03.995
That's the super Hanukkah
spirit!

06:03.997 --> 06:07.299
And here's a box of lights for
you to string up on the house.

06:07.301 --> 06:08.900
This has now become work.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.902
Not work, fun.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.437
Just like the Kremps have.

06:12.439 --> 06:13.739
Now get to work.

06:13.741 --> 06:14.906
I mean fun!

06:14.908 --> 06:17.209
<i> ¶ You better watch out</i>

06:18.278 --> 06:20.645
<i> ¶ You better not cry</i>

06:20.748 --> 06:22.447
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And so my mom finally got</i>

06:22.449 --> 06:24.883
<i> the Hanukkah</i>
<i> she always wanted...</i>

06:24.885 --> 06:25.951
<i> Christmas.</i>

06:25.953 --> 06:27.085
Do it with care.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.688
<i> One that would rival</i>
<i> the Kremps'.</i>

06:29.857 --> 06:30.455
<i> Before we knew it,</i>

06:30.457 --> 06:34.426
<i> we'd all been swept up</i>
<i> in the super Hanukkah spirit.</i>

06:34.962 --> 06:35.961
<i> And for the first time ever,</i>

06:35.963 --> 06:38.096
<i> our house wasn't</i>
<i> the only one on the block</i>

06:38.098 --> 06:39.898
<i> that didn't have</i>
<i> festive lights.</i>

06:39.900 --> 06:42.601
Three, two, one.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.736
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)
(LAUGHS)

06:44.738 --> 06:46.004
Yeah, baby!

06:46.006 --> 06:46.872
Looks expensive.

06:46.874 --> 06:49.608
It is!
Super Hanukkah!

06:49.610 --> 06:51.610
<i> ¶ Gonna find out</i>

06:51.745 --> 06:53.645
Oh, my god!
(GASPS)

06:53.647 --> 06:55.614
It's like I gave you
a list of stuff I wanted

06:55.616 --> 06:56.815
and you actually
bought it!

06:56.817 --> 06:59.918
Well, you made the list.
I checked it twice.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.354
No socks. No raisins.

07:02.356 --> 07:02.854
No underpants.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.624
Every gift under the bush
is better than the last!

07:05.626 --> 07:07.826
There's more
where that came from.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.261
This bad boy's from me.

07:09.263 --> 07:12.264
That's an officially licensed
key chain.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.131
(SNIFFS) Very rare.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.966
Stop speaking
your stupid words.

07:14.968 --> 07:18.136
Behold the gift Lainey got me,
an Eagles jersey!

07:18.138 --> 07:21.106
My dad re-tiled
their training facility.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.908
But the best part...

07:22.910 --> 07:24.709
The whole team
signed it!

07:24.711 --> 07:26.244
But the limit was $10!

07:26.246 --> 07:28.780
Oh, it's cool.
I got it for free.

07:29.183 --> 07:30.882
I love you so much
right now.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.217
This is the holiday
of my dreams,

07:32.219 --> 07:35.620
and I don't ever want it
to end, ever!

07:35.622 --> 07:37.022
<i> ¶ You better not pout</i>

07:37.024 --> 07:38.690
Ever!
(CHUCKLES)

07:38.692 --> 07:40.659
What the hell is this?

07:40.661 --> 07:42.027
Super Hanukkah!

07:42.029 --> 07:43.428
<i> ¶ Santa Claus ¶</i>
And what is this music?

07:43.430 --> 07:46.331
Neil Diamond,
the voice of our people.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.499
It's a Christmas song!

07:47.501 --> 07:50.001
My god!
Is that a Christmas tree?

07:50.003 --> 07:51.670
No,
it's a Hanukkah bush.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.905
That's not a thing.
A...

07:53.907 --> 07:54.840
Oh, my lord.

07:54.842 --> 07:58.410
Did you hang stockings
by the chimney with care?

07:58.412 --> 08:00.645
Not stockings,
Hanukkah socks.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.281
Ma, we're running out
of candy canes.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.150
Not candy canes.

08:05.152 --> 08:05.951
Peppermint J's.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.954
Can I wet your whistle
with some Hanu-nog?

08:08.956 --> 08:09.287
No!

08:09.289 --> 08:11.523
Dad, I'm just trying
to spice it up,

08:11.525 --> 08:12.324
like the Kremps do.

08:12.326 --> 08:15.060
They're good at family,
and now so are we.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.329
Trading in
your family's tradition

08:17.331 --> 08:18.964
is not
being good at family.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.932
I mean, what's next?
Santa Claus.

08:20.934 --> 08:24.870
I did the thing
for the blond neighbor people.

08:24.872 --> 08:25.537
No more.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.205
Understand?
No more!

08:27.207 --> 08:30.141
ADULT ADAM: <i> And just when Pops</i>
<i> thought it couldn't get</i>
<i> any worse...</i>

08:30.143 --> 08:31.142
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Hi!

08:31.144 --> 08:33.845
Hello!
I brought you
some decorations.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.081
(GASPS) Oh, my!
Oh, my.

08:36.083 --> 08:39.985
Your holiday is just so much
more vibrant than I remember.

08:39.987 --> 08:41.753
Well, we kicked it
up a notch.

08:41.755 --> 08:45.123
No! Hanukkah only has
one notch.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.124
Look at this!

08:46.126 --> 08:46.892
That's our Hanukkah bush.

08:46.894 --> 08:50.061
You know, I never knew
that there were
so many similarities

08:50.063 --> 08:51.096
between our two holidays.

08:51.098 --> 08:54.332
What is the story behind
the Hanukkah bush, anyway?

08:54.334 --> 08:56.101
Yeah, Betty.
What is the story?

08:56.103 --> 09:00.105
I mean, obviously, there's
a rich cultural significance.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.107
Otherwise, why would you
do this to me?

09:02.109 --> 09:07.078
Well, the Maccabees only had
enough oil for one night,

09:07.080 --> 09:08.880
and it was a miracle.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.348
And another miracle,

09:10.350 --> 09:14.786
was the finding of the bush
in the temple basement.

09:14.788 --> 09:18.857
And they decorated it
with festive tchotchkes.

09:18.859 --> 09:19.491
So interesting.

09:19.493 --> 09:21.660
Where'd they find
the tchotchkes?

09:21.662 --> 09:22.794
In their pockets.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.629
Tchotchke pockets.
They were potchkes.

09:24.631 --> 09:28.833
You forgot the part
where Aquaman swam to Egypt

09:28.835 --> 09:32.304
and parted the Red Sea
with his fish friends

09:32.306 --> 09:33.738
and Moses, the porpoise.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.608
Okay, that's enough.
You're being ridiculous.

09:36.610 --> 09:37.842
I'm ridiculous?

09:37.844 --> 09:41.379
I'll show you
who's ridiculous.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.213
You'll see.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.015
(DOOR CLOSES)
POPS: You'll see!

09:44.017 --> 09:47.018
Well, that was
the traditional
re-enactment

09:47.020 --> 09:51.089
of the storming out
of the land of Egypt,

09:51.391 --> 09:52.924
by Aquaman.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.326
Whoa.

09:56.897 --> 09:59.030
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As the holiday break wore on,</i>

09:59.032 --> 10:00.599
<i> Lainey continued</i>
<i> to edge me out</i>

10:00.601 --> 10:02.434
<i> of my holiday traditions</i>
<i> with Barry.</i>

10:02.436 --> 10:04.569
<i> She even edged me</i>
<i> off the couch.</i>

10:04.571 --> 10:06.137
(RUSTLING)

10:06.139 --> 10:06.905
Shh!

10:06.907 --> 10:08.139
Stop shifting
in the beanbag.

10:08.141 --> 10:11.309
Lainey and I are trying
to watch our favorite movie
here.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.210
Your favorite movie?

10:12.212 --> 10:14.045
It's supposed to be
our favorite movie.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.847
Well, it's been
re-favorited.

10:15.849 --> 10:16.948
That's not even a word.

10:16.950 --> 10:17.816
There's no way to know.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.784
You know what?
Fudge both you guys!

10:19.786 --> 10:23.955
And you've seen the movie,
so you know what that means!

10:26.259 --> 10:28.259
Dude, wait.
What's your deal?

10:28.261 --> 10:29.127
Did I do
something wrong?

10:29.129 --> 10:32.397
Oh, look at you,
acting all foxy and innocent.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.398
I'm onto you, lady.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.332
What are you
talking about?

10:34.334 --> 10:35.700
This is the only time
all year

10:35.702 --> 10:37.235
that Barry's
actually nice to me.

10:37.237 --> 10:40.672
But then you crashed our movie
and stole ball ball

10:40.674 --> 10:42.007
and ruined everything.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.308
I didn't mean to, okay?

10:43.310 --> 10:44.776
I'd never get between
two brothers.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.745
Again. It happened once
at summer camp.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.446
There were these
hot twins, and...

10:48.448 --> 10:49.114
It's not important.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.249
I'll just give you and Barry
some time alone.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.884
Y-you'd do that for me?

10:52.886 --> 10:53.385
Of course.

10:53.387 --> 10:55.286
I think it's really
cute that you love
your big brother.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.321
I'd never
get in the way of that.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.256
Have fun with Barry.
Tell him I'll see
him tomorrow.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.692
Thanks for being
so curvy and understanding.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.128
Hey, no problem.
Wait, what?

11:03.130 --> 11:04.963
Nothing! See ya.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.033
Guess who made
caramel corn.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.702
Move! That seat is saved
for Laineys only.

11:10.704 --> 11:11.736
Actually,
she had to bail,

11:11.738 --> 11:14.172
but now we get to watch
<i> A Christmas Story</i> together,

11:14.174 --> 11:14.973
like we always do.

11:14.975 --> 11:17.075
Nyeh. I've seen it
a billion times.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.177
Wait! Wait!
Where you going?

11:19.179 --> 11:20.712
Lainey's.
I miss her laugh.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.947
That's very sweet
and angering!

11:22.949 --> 11:25.617
See? You get it.
Bye, nerd.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.886
(MUFFLED)
<i> Don't leave me! Come back!</i>

11:27.888 --> 11:30.522
ADULT ADAM: <i> In that moment,</i>
<i> I decided to get Barry to stay</i>

11:30.524 --> 11:33.992
<i> by breaking the one</i>
<i> cardinal rule in our house,</i>

11:33.994 --> 11:36.661
<i> never dare Barry Goldberg.</i>

11:36.663 --> 11:37.529
Wait!

11:37.531 --> 11:39.431
You could go see Lainey,

11:39.433 --> 11:41.866
or you could accept
my double dog dare.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.169
Tell me what it is,
and I'll do it right now.

11:44.171 --> 11:44.869
I don't know.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.738
You'll be way too afraid
of this one.

11:46.740 --> 11:49.174
Impossible! I was born
without the fear gene.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.476
It's a medical miracle.
Ask any doctor.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.811
Okay. It's on.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.012
Grab your jacket.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.046
Dare complete. I win.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.015
Yeah,
that's not the dare.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.283
Follow me
to the tetherball pole.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.785
ADULT ADAM: <i> While I was trying</i>
<i> to spend time with my brother,</i>

12:00.787 --> 12:03.521
<i> my mom was having</i>
<i> the time of her life</i>

12:03.523 --> 12:05.657
<i> with her made-up holiday.</i>

12:06.059 --> 12:07.726
Lucky! Stop it!

12:07.994 --> 12:08.460
Hey, honey.

12:08.462 --> 12:11.062
Have you been wearing
that Santa suit all day?

12:11.064 --> 12:11.496
Oh, yeah.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.498
Turns out these pants keep
the fellas warm and toasty.

12:13.500 --> 12:17.669
And the girl at Wawa,
she gave me a free
lotto ticket.

12:17.671 --> 12:20.004
People love Santa Claus!

12:20.107 --> 12:21.239
Who knew?

12:21.241 --> 12:22.173
I think everyone.

12:22.175 --> 12:26.111
And a Merry Hanukkah
to you and yours!

12:26.113 --> 12:27.245
Dad,
what are you doing?

12:27.247 --> 12:30.582
What's it look like?
I'm handing out goodies
for the holiday.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.616
If you're trying
to be Hanukkah Harry

12:31.618 --> 12:34.786
to rub it in my face,
you've got it all wrong.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.454
No. I'm Hanu-Claus.

12:36.456 --> 12:40.525
I'm mashing two words together
to make one offensive one,

12:40.527 --> 12:41.693
just like you do.

12:41.695 --> 12:44.496
Now, who wants presents?

12:44.498 --> 12:45.563
Me, Hanu-Claus!

12:45.565 --> 12:46.865
Then prepare yourselves

12:46.867 --> 12:49.968
as I dole out gifts
from my sack of shame.

12:49.970 --> 12:53.738
No! Guilt has no place
in our people's holiday.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.440
BEVERLY: Shame on you.
I hope you feel guilty.

12:55.442 --> 12:59.677
Look! It's your Great-Grandpa
Samuel Solomon.

12:59.679 --> 13:02.447
He crossed Poland
with $2 in his shoe

13:02.449 --> 13:06.351
so his traditions
could live on here
in America,

13:06.353 --> 13:09.687
only for you
to dismantle his dream.

13:09.689 --> 13:10.655
Fun!

13:10.657 --> 13:12.123
I don't like Hanu-Claus.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.358
And what's this?

13:13.360 --> 13:15.260
This jar stores
all the traditions

13:15.262 --> 13:17.629
you've passed down
to your children.

13:17.631 --> 13:18.997
But it's empty.

13:18.999 --> 13:19.731
And look!

13:19.733 --> 13:22.333
Why, it's a button,
from the sweatshop

13:22.335 --> 13:26.304
your grandmother worked in
to put food on our table,

13:26.306 --> 13:28.807
even though
we didn't have a table.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.175
You had a table, Al.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.409
It wobbled!

13:31.411 --> 13:32.010
My god.

13:32.012 --> 13:35.013
There's like 20 more
super-sad things in here.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.015
And we're going through
them all,

13:37.017 --> 13:40.618
every last
depressing one of them.

13:41.154 --> 13:41.619
Fun!

Do it already.

Oh, I will do it.

I've stuck my tongue
to tons of different things.

Come on.

That's right.

14:15.455 --> 14:18.356
You ain't going nowhere,

14:18.792 --> 14:21.526
You've been ignoring me
all week, but no more!

out with your little brother,

15:02.535 --> 15:08.473
<i> ¶ On the fifth day of Hanukkah</i>
<i> My daughter said to me</i>

<i> ¶ Five backs a-stabbing</i>

15:29.996 --> 15:31.262
Okay, this was fun
for a bit,

15:31.264 --> 15:33.731
and then it got sad,
and now it's just bonkers.

15:33.733 --> 15:36.367
Give it to me.
Give me the banjo.
No!

15:36.369 --> 15:38.169
Just give her the banjo, Al!

Hey!

16:07.634 --> 16:08.866
Interesting tradition
there.

16:08.868 --> 16:11.469
Can we come over
and hear all about it?

16:11.471 --> 16:14.172
What exactly
does all this symbolize?

16:14.174 --> 16:17.075
We suck at family, okay?
Is that what you want to hear?

16:17.077 --> 16:19.377
You don't suck at all,
but we do.

16:19.379 --> 16:24.549
We, like,
suck butt at family.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.384
The big suck.

(BLEEP)

16:27.887 --> 16:29.320
Yeah!

16:31.157 --> 16:32.590

16:33.693 --> 16:35.293
(BLEEP)

16:36.429 --> 16:38.529
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It was hour two on the pole.</i>

16:38.531 --> 16:40.365
<i> It was freezing,</i>
<i> but nothing could thaw</i>

16:40.367 --> 16:43.034
<i> the tension</i>
<i> between me and Barry.</i>

17:45.799 --> 17:47.565
(GRUNTS)

17:48.435 --> 17:51.202
(BOTH GRUNTING)

17:52.138 --> 17:53.838
(DOOR OPENS)

17:55.875 --> 17:58.209
(BOTH GRUNTING)

18:01.915 --> 18:03.781
I've raised morons.

18:05.151 --> 18:06.551
ADULT ADAM:
<i> That's the thing about family.</i>

18:06.553 --> 18:08.686
<i> Even though</i>
<i> you may not say it clearly,</i>

18:08.688 --> 18:09.654
<i> you know in your heart</i>

18:09.656 --> 18:11.789
<i> they'll always be there</i>
<i> for you.</i>

18:11.791 --> 18:12.857
Hey.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.725
There any room for me?

18:14.828 --> 18:16.160
Of course.

18:16.162 --> 18:17.995
ADULT ADAM: <i> And sometimes</i>
<i> you just have to accept</i>

18:17.997 --> 18:20.932
<i> that there's enough love</i>
<i> to go around.</i>

18:20.934 --> 18:23.234
You guys have
some good brother time?

18:23.470 --> 18:24.702
It was all right.

18:24.704 --> 18:27.004
<i> ¶ Who's naughty and nice</i>

18:27.107 --> 18:27.772
<i> ¶ Say it now</i>

18:27.774 --> 18:30.007
ADULT ADAM:
<i> 'Cause being good at family</i>
<i> wasn't about</i>

18:30.009 --> 18:32.777
<i> making the old holiday</i>
<i> sizzle and pop.</i>

18:32.779 --> 18:33.711
<i> It was about remembering</i>

18:33.713 --> 18:37.048
<i> why the holiday was important</i>
<i> in the first place.</i>

18:37.050 --> 18:40.218
Hey, Dad.
What you got there?

18:40.587 --> 18:41.452
Mom's locket.

18:41.454 --> 18:45.256
Never saw this picture
of me and her before.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.924
(CHUCKLES)

18:47.327 --> 18:50.094
She looks so happy.

18:50.096 --> 18:51.696
Oh, she was.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.065
It was
your first Hanukkah.

18:54.067 --> 18:55.199
Meant the world to her.

18:55.201 --> 18:58.136
Dad, I'm sorry.
I guess I just got
carried away.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.838
I think it's safe to say
we both did.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.741
All I wanted was to be
good at family, you know?

19:03.743 --> 19:04.742
And you are, Bev.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.278
But part of
being good at family

19:07.280 --> 19:10.181
is knowing
where you came from.

19:11.718 --> 19:12.650
<i> ¶ Come on, now</i>

19:12.652 --> 19:16.087
<i> ¶ Santa Claus</i>
<i> is comin' to town</i>

19:16.089 --> 19:16.621
Thanks, Dad.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.890
<i> ¶ Santa Claus</i>
<i> is comin' to town</i>

19:18.892 --> 19:23.961
<i> ¶ Santa Claus</i>
<i> is comin' to town</i>

19:23.963 --> 19:25.563
<i> ¶ Oh, yeah ¶</i>

19:25.565 --> 19:27.965
Ginzy? You okay?

19:28.168 --> 19:29.300
Yeah.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.935
Yeah, all good.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.137
Even though
everything's poop.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.972
It's all poop, Bev,
all of it.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.375
What are you
talking about?

19:37.377 --> 19:40.278
You're good at family!
Remember?

19:40.280 --> 19:41.078
Are you kidding?

19:41.080 --> 19:42.079
Scott gave Daisy
some nog.

19:42.081 --> 19:44.315
Now I have to
get my rugs cleaned.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.917
Steve shot Drew
with the stupid BB gun,

19:45.919 --> 19:47.318
and Charles
burned the ham.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.886
Now we don't even have
Christmas dinner.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.355
ADULT ADAM:
<i> In that moment,</i>
<i> my mom realized</i>

19:51.357 --> 19:53.090
<i> the Kremps were no better</i>
<i> at family than us</i>

19:53.092 --> 19:56.794
<i> and there was no such thing</i>
<i> as a perfect holiday.</i>

19:57.897 --> 19:59.363
Come with me.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.097
I know a place.

20:00.099 --> 20:06.170
<i> ¶ Better be good</i>
<i> For goodness' sake</i>

20:06.172 --> 20:08.673
<i> ¶ Little tin horns</i>

20:08.975 --> 20:09.974
<i> ¶ And little toy drums</i>

20:09.976 --> 20:12.977
Who even knew
restaurants were open today?

20:12.979 --> 20:13.744
We knew.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.681
Chinese on Christmas,
it's kind of our thing.

20:16.683 --> 20:17.481
(CHUCKLES)

20:17.483 --> 20:19.884
Learn something new
every day, right?

20:20.553 --> 20:21.552
Sure do.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.021
ADULT ADAM:
<i> So, this was our</i>
<i> Christmas story.</i>

20:24.023 --> 20:25.389
<i> It for sure</i>
<i> doesn't look like yours,</i>

20:25.391 --> 20:29.427
<i> but it's not about</i>
<i> how or what you celebrate.</i>

20:29.429 --> 20:31.862
<i> It's who you celebrate with.</i>

20:31.864 --> 20:34.131
<i> And, yeah, ours was crazy.</i>

20:34.133 --> 20:35.666
Aah!
Oh, geez!

20:35.668 --> 20:37.802
<i> But it was awesome.</i>

20:38.605 --> 20:40.271
<i> ¶ Can't stop that man no-how</i>

20:40.273 --> 20:42.673
<i> ¶ Santa Claus</i>
<i> is comin' to town ¶</i>

20:44.644 --> 20:45.876
Merry Christmas.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.378
That's a great present.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.347
Chet, what do you have there?
What is that?

20:49.349 --> 20:51.148
Let me look.
(DRUMMING)

20:51.150 --> 20:53.684
Whoa!
Dude, check this out!

20:54.420 --> 20:55.052
Sit! Sit!

20:55.054 --> 20:57.555
You want to have
your Christmas present?

20:57.557 --> 20:59.023
Whoa!

21:02.562 --> 21:05.329
Oh! A card!

21:05.331 --> 21:06.364
Thank you!

21:06.366 --> 21:07.632
It's the eighth day
of Hanukkah.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.267
Figure I'd save the best
for last.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.468
Well, I love it.

21:10.470 --> 21:13.037
But you know what present
I'd really love?

21:13.039 --> 21:14.972
A snuggie
from my biggest boy.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.875
Yeah, not gonna happen.
Not even if I dare you?

21:17.877 --> 21:19.944
Oh, god.
Don't do this.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.646
Triple dog dare!

21:21.648 --> 21:23.814
You'll regret
ever challenging me.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.316
Take these snuggies!

21:25.318 --> 21:25.983
Take 'em!

21:25.985 --> 21:26.851
Barry wins
at everything.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.953
(CHUCKLING)
That's right, honey. You win.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.921
Barry wins
at everything!
