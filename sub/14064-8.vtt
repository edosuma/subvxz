00:13.972 --> 00:15.098
Hey!

00:16.058 --> 00:17.933
Hey, pal!

00:19.519 --> 00:22.272
Jeez, what,
what are you doing?

00:48.298 --> 00:50.008
Thank you.

00:53.470 --> 00:54.936
Night terrors?

00:54.971 --> 00:56.730
I haven't had them in years.

00:56.765 --> 01:00.101
Usually it's
brought on by distress.

01:00.136 --> 01:03.438
Maybe it's my
breakup with Tara.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.947
You jump off balconies?

01:05.982 --> 01:09.110
I could where I
happen to be living.

01:09.569 --> 01:12.654
I see images of someone or

01:12.739 --> 01:16.074
something after me
and in my sleep, I run.

01:16.110 --> 01:19.412
–It's awful.
–Last week it was clowns.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.666
Denny…

01:23.833 --> 01:27.211
how would you feel
about sleeping with me?

01:27.246 --> 01:29.887
Next to me, until this passes,

01:29.922 --> 01:32.967
just to make sure I
don't leap off the 14th floor.

01:33.002 --> 01:35.004
You'll do anything
to get me into bed.

01:35.004 --> 01:38.014
Denny, night terrors, they can

01:38.097 --> 01:41.058
be potentially
life-threatening.

01:46.147 --> 01:48.030
Because we're friends,

01:48.065 --> 01:53.321
I'm gonna tell you something
that nobody else knows.

01:56.032 --> 01:57.846
I'm homophobic.

01:57.881 --> 01:59.625
I'm stunned.

01:59.660 --> 02:02.955
Look, I'd do
almost anything for you,

02:02.990 --> 02:05.583
but I cannot share my bed.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.402
Be a man. Get a girl.

02:39.582 --> 02:40.532
Ass fat!

02:40.603 --> 02:41.448
Pardon?

02:41.519 --> 02:42.843
Tori, let me.

02:42.922 --> 02:43.895
She gets upset.

02:43.973 --> 02:45.376
Okay, Tori and I
have been friends

02:45.376 --> 02:46.818
since I won't
even tell you how long,

02:46.818 --> 02:48.493
so when we decided
to have our lips done…

02:48.493 --> 02:50.285
–We had our lips done.
–We did our research.

02:50.285 --> 02:51.844
And we found the
best lip man in Boston.

02:51.844 --> 02:52.935
Reputed to be the best.

02:52.935 --> 02:54.337
–Yes, and he
doesn't use collagen

02:54.337 --> 02:55.740
He doesn't use
collagen, instead…

02:55.740 --> 02:57.454
Instead he sticks a
hollow needle into you,

02:57.454 --> 02:58.583
you know, back there,

02:58.583 --> 03:00.493
and he removes a sample
of fat from the buttocks.

03:00.493 --> 03:02.519
–Lasts longer than collagen.
–Oh, totally natural.

03:02.519 --> 03:03.883
He then injects
it into the lips,

03:03.883 --> 03:05.168
making them
youthful and lovely.

03:05.168 --> 03:06.103
Very hygienic.

03:06.181 --> 03:07.544
And it was all
good and fine until

03:07.544 --> 03:08.948
one day last
week, we got a call…

03:08.948 --> 03:10.818
We got a call from
his physician's assistant.

03:10.818 --> 03:12.493
She was present at all of the

03:12.571 --> 03:14.207
procedures, not
attractive, not happy.

03:14.207 --> 03:15.766
And she told us
that our doctor…

03:15.766 --> 03:16.701
Oh, God.

03:16.778 --> 03:18.348
… has been injecting his own

03:18.415 --> 03:19.973
ass fat into women's lips.

03:20.052 --> 03:21.142
His own…

03:21.220 --> 03:23.012
Yes. We want to
sue Dr Glouberman.

03:23.012 --> 03:23.947
For fraud.

03:24.025 --> 03:25.350
–Or malpractice.
–Or something.

03:25.350 --> 03:27.376
I have the
man's ass in my face.

03:27.454 --> 03:31.661
Did you say Dr Glouberman,
Dr Barry Glouberman?

03:31.740 --> 03:34.077
She's had work. I told you.

03:34.155 --> 03:36.376
Dr Glouberman is a
client at this firm.

03:36.454 --> 03:38.791
We structured his corporation,
among other things,

03:38.791 --> 03:41.909
so we can't represent you in
any action against him.

03:41.986 --> 03:43.311
Well, that's stupid.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.298
In fact, if you do sue

03:45.376 --> 03:47.207
him, I'll be the one he calls.

03:47.285 --> 03:49.329
I can't represent you.

03:49.414 --> 03:51.373
This whole thing is absurd.

03:51.459 --> 03:52.949
Any number of people could

03:52.949 --> 03:54.354
have run over that old man.

03:54.354 --> 03:56.781
But Jason's the one
about to go on trial.

03:56.781 --> 03:57.846
With an alibi.

03:57.931 --> 03:59.847
Who happens to be his father.

03:59.933 --> 04:01.764
Are you saying that
you don't believe me?

04:01.764 --> 04:03.296
Of course we believe you.

04:03.298 --> 04:05.640
We even believe the part
about the car being stolen.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.214
We believe it all, Ronald.

04:07.214 --> 04:09.174
That's why you pay us.

04:09.260 --> 04:11.403
We're not saying we can't win.

04:11.491 --> 04:14.483
How can you not
win? My son has an alibi.

04:14.572 --> 04:16.492
There's no physical

04:16.581 --> 04:18.457
evidence linking
him to the crime.

04:18.457 --> 04:22.296
–The car.
–Which was stolen.

04:22.386 --> 04:30.426
Jason, do you
have anything to say?

04:31.102 --> 04:32.103
I did it.

04:32.186 --> 04:33.438
Son…

04:33.521 --> 04:35.023
Dad…

04:36.691 --> 04:39.152
I ran that guy over.

04:42.946 --> 04:44.741
I did it.

04:55.543 --> 04:57.461
No, no. I paid that.

04:57.496 --> 04:58.959
On the, uh…

04:58.994 --> 05:00.423
the, uh…

05:00.923 --> 05:02.139
14th.

05:02.174 --> 05:05.094
Yeah, well, my records
clearly show that I did.

05:05.129 --> 05:06.477
Yeah, well…

05:06.512 --> 05:08.139
Yeah, well,
maybe, maybe I'm the

05:08.139 --> 05:09.557
victim of
identity theft, okay?

05:09.557 --> 05:12.893
Okay, maybe, maybe,
I am not who I am, huh?

05:12.928 --> 05:14.854
Have you thought of that?

05:19.233 --> 05:21.145
Obviously, we can't
call Jason to the stand.

05:21.145 --> 05:22.611
We'd be suborning perjury.

05:22.611 --> 05:25.322
I talked to the kid.
He won't admit it again.

05:25.357 --> 05:28.075
Denny, we cannot knowingly put

05:28.159 --> 05:30.786
a client on the stand to lie.

05:30.828 --> 05:32.210
Because?

05:32.246 --> 05:33.789
Fortunately, we
may not have to.

05:33.789 --> 05:36.208
Our only eyewitness
suffers from Alzheimer's.

05:36.208 --> 05:38.287
The state may well not
be able to make their case.

05:38.287 --> 05:40.080
What about the other
witness who saw the car?

05:40.080 --> 05:41.136
Which was stolen.

05:41.171 --> 05:42.923
Oh, right. I keep forgetting.

05:42.958 --> 05:44.675
I'd like you to canvass the

05:44.758 --> 05:46.218
neighborhood one last time,

05:46.218 --> 05:48.470
see if anybody
else saw anything.

05:48.554 --> 05:49.930
In the meantime, Paul, maybe

05:49.930 --> 05:51.265
you could
visit our eyewitness,

05:51.265 --> 05:53.976
see what we're dealing with.

05:54.059 --> 05:57.020
You're the one who will
be crossing her, Shirley.

05:57.104 --> 05:59.815
Those assisted
living places…

05:59.898 --> 06:01.358
I'm sorry, I know

06:01.442 --> 06:03.110
heebie-jeebies
isn't a legal term but…

06:03.110 --> 06:04.611
It needs to be you,

06:04.695 --> 06:06.113
Shirley. You're
trying this case.

06:06.113 --> 06:09.658
You need to
interview this woman.

06:14.288 --> 06:15.546
This is ridiculous.

06:15.581 --> 06:16.957
And the women claim that it's

06:16.957 --> 06:18.160
your old physician's assistant

06:18.160 --> 06:19.873
that's the whistle-blower.

06:19.908 --> 06:21.551
Helen? I had to fire her.

06:21.586 --> 06:23.297
The woman broke a needle three

06:23.297 --> 06:24.833
times in three
different patients.

06:24.833 --> 06:26.341
She was a
danger to my clients.

06:26.341 --> 06:27.361
Barry, calm down.

06:27.425 --> 06:29.106
Yeah, it was either fire her

06:29.136 --> 06:30.762
or send my malpractice

06:30.846 --> 06:32.514
insurance
screaming through the roof.

06:32.514 --> 06:35.517
So then she turns
around and sues me.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.103
Fired for
wrongful termination.

06:38.186 --> 06:39.686
And we took care of that.

06:39.688 --> 06:43.441
This kind of
allegation alone, though…

06:43.525 --> 06:45.694
What am I gonna do?

06:45.777 --> 06:47.279
We need to meet
with this woman,

06:47.279 --> 06:49.447
your ex-nurse,
get her to recant.

06:49.531 --> 06:51.074
It's the best way to head

06:51.157 --> 06:52.659
this lawsuit off at the pass.

06:52.659 --> 06:55.287
She's a vicious,
spiteful, treacherous pig.

06:55.370 --> 06:56.705
That's what she is.

06:56.788 --> 06:58.748
I'm not gonna lead with that.

06:58.832 --> 07:00.667
Do I need to meet with her

07:00.750 --> 07:02.460
alone, or can you be civil?

07:04.796 --> 07:07.292
Oh, are you illiterate
or you just can't read?

07:07.292 --> 07:08.306
You know…

07:08.341 --> 07:11.594
No, “final notice” means that
it's the final notice.

07:11.629 --> 07:13.923
Otherwise it would
say, “final shutoff.”

07:13.923 --> 07:15.014
Suppose I was in my

07:15.014 --> 07:16.558
apartment hooked
up to a respirator.

07:16.558 --> 07:18.268
I would be dead
right now, okay?

07:18.268 --> 07:19.853
You would be
talking to a dead person.

07:19.853 --> 07:21.604
Melissa?

07:27.861 --> 07:30.905
Would you excuse us, please?

07:36.035 --> 07:38.288
From what I
gather, you seem to be

07:38.371 --> 07:40.706
having some
financial difficulties.

07:40.741 --> 07:43.042
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm just a, uh…

07:43.077 --> 07:44.384
a shopper.

07:44.419 --> 07:45.962
You know, there's
a certain power to

07:45.962 --> 07:47.505
being able to buy
anything you want,

07:47.505 --> 07:49.340
and I don't know, have you

07:49.424 --> 07:51.217
been to the
new pottery barrel?

07:51.217 --> 07:52.635
–No.
–No.

07:52.718 --> 07:55.763
If you get their
catalog, turn to page 37.

07:55.847 --> 07:57.306
That's my bedroom.

07:57.390 --> 08:01.435
Would you like to earn
some extra money, Melissa?

08:01.519 --> 08:05.314
Uh, how?

08:06.524 --> 08:10.069
I have a condition.

08:10.903 --> 08:13.913
It's called night terrors.

08:13.948 --> 08:21.080
During the deepest
levels of non-REM sleep,

08:21.115 --> 08:24.834
I hear voices,
terrifying voices,

08:24.869 --> 08:27.218
and sometimes I run.

08:27.253 --> 08:32.299
Since I'm sound
asleep when I'm running,

08:32.333 --> 08:37.346
this puts me in
significant physical danger.

08:38.806 --> 08:43.143
I need somebody
to guard me at night.

08:43.178 --> 08:46.355
When you say “guard”…

08:46.522 --> 08:50.504
I need you to lie
in the bed with me.

08:50.540 --> 08:54.488
Should I get up to
run outside, stop me.

08:57.199 --> 08:59.639
How stupid do you think I am?

08:59.674 --> 09:02.079
So you'll think about it?

09:15.843 --> 09:19.680
Lydia, this is
Shirley Schmidt.

09:19.715 --> 09:22.396
–Hello, Lydia.
–Hello.

09:22.432 --> 09:24.851
–Who is she, Toque?
–Shirley Schmidt.

09:24.893 --> 09:26.395
She was going to talk to you

09:26.395 --> 09:27.854
about Albert
being hit by the car.

09:27.854 --> 09:30.399
Yes, I know.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.234
Where's my apple juice?

09:32.317 --> 09:34.403
I'm getting it now.

09:36.697 --> 09:40.158
–Your violets are lovely.
–Ceramic pots.

09:40.193 --> 09:43.745
Never terra-cotta. They
collect salt.

09:43.780 --> 09:45.831
But you're not here for that.

09:45.866 --> 09:48.166
No, I'm afraid I'm not.

09:51.586 --> 09:54.005
Here's a little
one all dressed up.

09:54.040 --> 09:56.108
My granddaughter.

09:56.142 --> 09:58.176
Oh, she's adorable.

09:59.302 --> 10:01.116
What's her name?

10:01.151 --> 10:02.896
You're testing me.

10:02.931 --> 10:06.267
–I'm afraid I am.
–Her name is Julie.

10:06.302 --> 10:09.688
She's dressed as Groucho Marx

10:09.771 --> 10:13.066
from my
favorite movie of 1939,

10:13.108 --> 10:15.617
“At the circus.”

10:15.652 --> 10:19.656
And that boy
committed the crime.

10:21.533 --> 10:24.577
People think I
don't remember things,

10:24.612 --> 10:26.871
and a lot of things I

10:26.955 --> 10:29.207
don't, like
names and so forth,

10:29.242 --> 10:33.294
but traumatic events?

10:33.503 --> 10:35.505
I'll never
forget what happened

10:35.588 --> 10:37.548
outside that
window that night.

10:37.583 --> 10:39.390
It was horrible.

10:39.425 --> 10:42.887
I'm sorry. It must
have been awful for you.

10:44.263 --> 10:46.272
Toque?

10:46.307 --> 10:48.066
This is orange juice.

10:48.101 --> 10:50.207
Oh, they were
out of apple, honey.

10:50.242 --> 10:52.403
But it's always
apple for lunch.

10:52.438 --> 10:54.565
It's okay,
Lydia. Orange is okay.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.948
No, it's not!

10:55.983 --> 10:59.362
Orange is for
breakfast. Apple's for lunch.

10:59.397 --> 11:02.830
It's always apple! Always!

11:02.864 --> 11:04.784
–Can I help?
–Here, let me help.

11:04.784 --> 11:06.946
There's nothing to
do but calm her down.

11:06.946 --> 11:08.663
It's okay, honey. It's okay.

11:08.698 --> 11:10.748
It's okay. It's okay.

11:18.547 --> 11:21.050
I was out walking my dog, when

11:21.133 --> 11:23.552
suddenly I
heard this screech…

11:23.587 --> 11:26.472
and, uh, then a thump.

11:26.507 --> 11:27.688
I turned around.

11:27.723 --> 11:30.274
I saw a white sedan speed off,

11:30.309 --> 11:33.069
uh, with a body at
the side of the road.

11:33.104 --> 11:36.164
–Were you able to get a license plate number?
–Yes.

11:36.183 --> 11:39.658
ZXL3R. Massachusetts plates.

11:39.693 --> 11:42.106
The record will
reflect the parties stipulate

11:42.106 --> 11:43.906
that the license is registered

11:43.989 --> 11:45.741
to the
defendant Jason Matheny.

11:45.741 --> 11:48.077
Thank you, Mr Nasland.

11:49.536 --> 11:51.420
Don't go rough.

11:51.455 --> 11:54.249
He just lost his
grandfather, for God's sakes.

11:54.284 --> 11:56.908
That wasn't his
grandfather who died, Denny.

11:56.908 --> 11:59.498
He's just a witness
who was walking his dog.

11:59.498 --> 12:01.632
Whatever.

12:03.092 --> 12:06.970
Sir, were you able to
see who was driving the car?

12:07.004 --> 12:08.729
–No.
–Thank you.

12:08.764 --> 12:11.009
For the record, the
parties stipulate the car was

12:11.009 --> 12:14.645
reported stolen the
night of the accident.

12:15.354 --> 12:17.773
Too rough?

12:43.840 --> 12:45.425
Standard service agreement

12:45.509 --> 12:47.191
contract, mostly boilerplate.

12:47.191 --> 12:48.887
The language
of what I will and

12:48.887 --> 12:50.555
will not do is quite specific,

12:50.555 --> 12:53.642
so there won't be
any Clintonian mishaps.

12:53.677 --> 12:56.985
“Is” means is.

12:57.020 --> 13:00.773
“No touching, no
cuddling, no sex.”

13:00.809 --> 13:02.549
You've taken out all the fun.

13:02.567 --> 13:03.652
These are my terms.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.543
For that, I will
sleep in your bed

13:05.543 --> 13:07.399
and will make
sure you don't wig out,

13:07.399 --> 13:08.955
and that's it.

13:08.990 --> 13:13.495
I'm not sure the term
“wig out” has legal teeth.

13:13.530 --> 13:16.206
But it is extremely Xeroxable

13:16.289 --> 13:18.917
for all the
partners' windshields.

13:20.668 --> 13:22.427
Thank you, Melissa.

13:22.462 --> 13:27.050
I give you my word I'll honor
all your terms and…

13:27.085 --> 13:29.093
thank you.

13:31.679 --> 13:34.015
I'll see you at 10 o'clock.

13:38.394 --> 13:40.160
Wait a second.
You're denying this?

13:40.160 --> 13:42.127
–Of course I'm denying it.
–Barry…

13:42.127 --> 13:44.060
–It never happened.
–I was there!

13:44.060 --> 13:46.069
Hold on. Barry.

13:46.361 --> 13:47.814
When you say you were there…

13:47.814 --> 13:49.280
I helped him remove his own

13:49.280 --> 13:50.740
fat cells from his buttocks.

13:50.740 --> 13:52.700
–To use on myself.
–Barry…

13:52.784 --> 13:54.077
That's what you said, Barry.

13:54.077 --> 13:55.912
Look, I removed the cells, I

13:55.995 --> 13:57.789
harvested the fat,
and I marked the vials.

13:57.789 --> 13:59.949
And I saw him go
to the vials to use

13:59.957 --> 14:02.043
that fat to
inject into other women.

14:02.043 --> 14:04.170
Then why didn't you say
something if you thought…

14:04.170 --> 14:05.379
Because I first thought it

14:05.379 --> 14:06.714
was with the
patients' consent,

14:06.714 --> 14:09.050
And then I asked a few.
–Asked them what?

14:09.050 --> 14:10.218
Where the harvested fat for

14:10.218 --> 14:11.385
their procedures came from.

14:11.385 --> 14:12.637
They said their own buttocks.

14:12.637 --> 14:13.721
Which is the truth.

14:13.721 --> 14:14.805
Barry… Oh, please!

14:14.889 --> 14:17.391
You're just trying to ruin me.

14:17.475 --> 14:18.476
Barry.

14:18.559 --> 14:21.062
Ms Gershen,
obviously this kind of charge,

14:21.062 --> 14:22.313
when it goes to a person's

14:22.313 --> 14:23.522
profession, is libel per se.

14:23.522 --> 14:27.193
We wouldn't even have
to show actual damages.

14:27.276 --> 14:29.737
I'm no lawyer,
but on the TV shows,

14:29.820 --> 14:32.156
they say truth is
a defense to libel.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.324
I see.

14:33.407 --> 14:35.534
And are you prepared to prove

14:35.618 --> 14:37.703
the truth of
these allegations?

14:37.787 --> 14:39.413
Sure.

14:39.497 --> 14:41.457
May I ask how?

14:41.540 --> 14:43.640
Do DNA on him.
Do it on their lips.

14:43.709 --> 14:45.252
You'll see a match.

14:45.336 --> 14:47.838
Won't she, Barry?

14:48.631 --> 14:50.973
I'm not giving
any DNA samples.

14:51.008 --> 14:55.554
That's, um,
unconstitutional, right?

14:58.891 --> 15:00.970
You met with the
woman, Shirley. Certainly…

15:00.970 --> 15:02.680
I don't want to do
it. It's that simple.

15:02.680 --> 15:04.653
No, it is not that simple.

15:04.688 --> 15:06.649
We have an
obligation as attorneys…

15:06.649 --> 15:09.818
Oh, spare me the speech,
Paul, would you please?

15:09.853 --> 15:12.073
Well, evidently,
you need the speech.

15:12.106 --> 15:13.546
Like it or not, this job

15:13.614 --> 15:15.636
gets dirty from time to time.

15:15.671 --> 15:17.659
What the hell
is going on here?

15:17.743 --> 15:18.786
It's just..

15:20.287 --> 15:23.165
preying on somebody
with Alzheimer's when…

15:23.200 --> 15:26.043
obviously I'm a
little sensitive given…

15:26.078 --> 15:28.135
Given what?

15:28.170 --> 15:30.214
I say a if a woman's
brain has turned to oatmeal,

15:30.214 --> 15:32.466
let's throw in some raisins

15:32.549 --> 15:34.635
and have her for breakfast.

15:34.718 --> 15:36.386
What, you think you have to

15:36.470 --> 15:38.096
handle me with
kid gloves, Shirley?

15:38.096 --> 15:40.057
This case has nothing
to do with you, Denny.

15:40.057 --> 15:42.351
Don't lie to me.

15:42.434 --> 15:45.937
Would you excuse
us for a second, Paul?

15:50.692 --> 15:52.152
I know how terrified you are.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.613
–I'm afraid of nothing.
–Denny…

15:54.654 --> 15:56.990
whether or not
you have some mild

15:57.073 --> 15:59.402
form of Alzheimer's, and
maybe you don't,

15:59.402 --> 16:02.502
there is no
denying your denying.

16:02.537 --> 16:06.687
You walk around saying
you have mad cow disease.

16:06.722 --> 16:10.837
God forbid people
think you have Alzheimer's.

16:11.463 --> 16:13.722
It took your father.

16:13.757 --> 16:17.344
You're afraid it'll take you.

16:18.053 --> 16:19.638
You don't know me, Shirley.

16:19.638 --> 16:21.097
Hell, I don't even know me.

16:21.097 --> 16:24.225
Have you talked
to Alan about this?

16:24.726 --> 16:25.775
Why should I?

16:25.810 --> 16:28.438
Because he's your best friend.

16:34.402 --> 16:36.779
“Do not crowd the afflicted.

16:36.821 --> 16:39.080
Do not chase the afflicted.”

16:39.115 --> 16:42.327
–I'm the afflicted.
–You think?

16:42.744 --> 16:44.294
“Use soothing tones.”

16:44.329 --> 16:45.997
“Say the
afflicted's name gently.”

16:45.997 --> 16:49.730
“Use comforting phrases
such as come back to bed,”

16:49.765 --> 16:53.463
“you are safe, everything is
all right, I am here.”

16:54.714 --> 16:59.635
So how long have you
had these, um, episodes?

17:00.178 --> 17:03.354
Are they, you know, bad?

17:03.389 --> 17:07.935
Have you ever read
“Oroonoko” by Aphra Behn?

17:08.227 --> 17:11.189
–No.
–Neither have I.

17:12.190 --> 17:15.693
–La-di-da.
–By the way, Melissa,

17:15.728 --> 17:17.694
as immune as you are to any

17:17.778 --> 17:20.571
sexual advances on my part,

17:20.607 --> 17:23.367
I have had the occasional

17:23.451 --> 17:26.996
fantasy about
the Michelin man.

17:37.882 --> 17:41.218
People know where I am
if anything happens to me.

18:29.183 --> 18:31.414
Good work.

18:31.449 --> 18:33.645
You can go.

18:45.657 --> 18:47.492
How many patients?

18:47.527 --> 18:48.834
Not too many.

18:48.869 --> 18:50.245
Lie to me
again, Barry, and you

18:50.245 --> 18:51.621
can get
yourself a new attorney.

18:51.621 --> 18:55.250
How many women did
you inject your fat into?

18:55.333 --> 18:57.878
Nine, ten.

18:59.087 --> 19:00.088
30.

19:00.171 --> 19:02.674
You can see,
there's an endless supply.

19:02.757 --> 19:06.887
You injected your fat
into as many as 30 women?

19:06.970 --> 19:09.764
What do I do?
If this gets out,

19:09.848 --> 19:11.892
it's not like I'm a

19:11.975 --> 19:14.019
multidimensional
person with a family.

19:14.019 --> 19:17.564
All I have is my
job, my reputation.

19:17.647 --> 19:21.776
Before we go any further, um,

19:22.152 --> 19:24.612
the injections you gave me

19:24.696 --> 19:26.997
for my chicken pox scars…

19:27.032 --> 19:30.827
do I have extractions from
your buttocks in my face?

19:32.370 --> 19:33.712
Oh, my God.

19:33.747 --> 19:36.416
You didn't want to
harvest your own fat.

19:36.458 --> 19:38.626
The synthetic stuff has only

19:38.710 --> 19:40.760
been FDA-approved for a year.

19:40.795 --> 19:43.840
Some cells are
better than others.

19:43.875 --> 19:45.974
This may sound funny,

19:46.009 --> 19:49.185
but I built my
reputation on my ass.

19:49.220 --> 19:52.515
It's why they all come
to me, however unwittingly.

19:52.550 --> 19:56.269
I would never do
anything to harm a patient.

19:56.304 --> 19:59.272
My fat, Denise,
it's the good stuff.

19:59.307 --> 20:01.072
First…

20:01.107 --> 20:02.667
we are gonna try to settle

20:02.734 --> 20:04.193
with these
women before they sue,

20:04.193 --> 20:06.327
or else your
fat ass is history.

20:06.362 --> 20:11.951
Then I will decide
whether I sue you myself.

20:17.290 --> 20:20.668
I saw Mr Bellows
crossing the street,

20:20.702 --> 20:23.421
and then this
big white car came

20:23.504 --> 20:26.986
racing through the
intersection and hit him.

20:27.021 --> 20:30.469
The car stopped for a
moment and then sped away.

20:30.504 --> 20:33.635
People came
running out screaming.

20:33.670 --> 20:35.823
Mr Bellows was
just lying there.

20:35.858 --> 20:37.977
And did you get a good look at

20:38.019 --> 20:39.312
who was driving the white car?

20:39.312 --> 20:40.603
Yes, I did.

20:40.688 --> 20:42.857
It was that boy over there.

20:42.940 --> 20:45.234
I saw him
through the windshield.

20:45.317 --> 20:48.821
The streetlight was
shining on his face.

20:48.903 --> 20:50.448
One final question.

20:50.531 --> 20:54.076
Have you been diagnosed with
stage four Alzheimer's?

20:54.160 --> 20:57.246
That's what my
doctors tell me.

20:57.329 --> 21:00.207
So I get a little distracted

21:00.291 --> 21:03.127
at times, but I
know what I saw.

21:03.210 --> 21:08.173
That boy hit Mr Bellows
and then drove away.

21:08.257 --> 21:10.843
Thank you, Mrs Tuffalo.

21:13.262 --> 21:14.756
The fact that
she's stage four could

21:14.756 --> 21:16.265
give us reasonable
doubt right there.

21:16.265 --> 21:18.517
Do we really want to
risk alienating the jury?

21:18.517 --> 21:20.894
Don't be ridiculous. We

21:20.978 --> 21:23.272
cannot let that
testimony stand.

21:23.355 --> 21:25.399
Just a thought.

21:25.941 --> 21:28.228
Hello, Mrs Tuffalo.
I'm Shirley Schmidt.

21:28.228 --> 21:30.411
–We met the other day.
–Yes, dear.

21:30.445 --> 21:33.991
–How are you today?
–I'm fine, thank you.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.326
You say you get a
little distracted?

21:36.410 --> 21:38.620
I'm wondering
how little is little?

21:38.662 --> 21:40.379
I know what I saw.

21:40.414 --> 21:41.915
I'm sure you think you do,

21:41.915 --> 21:43.625
but it was dark
and overcast the

21:43.625 --> 21:45.245
night of the
accident, wasn't it?

21:45.245 --> 21:46.843
It was dark.

21:46.878 --> 21:52.050
As for being overcast,
it's seldom sunny at night.

21:52.085 --> 21:54.886
The driver never got
out of the car, did he?

21:54.920 --> 21:57.597
I saw him through
the windshield.

21:57.632 --> 22:00.642
What's my name, Mrs Tuffalo?

22:00.677 --> 22:01.893
It's Shirley Schmidt.

22:01.893 --> 22:04.306
Through the glare of a
windshield on a dark night

22:04.306 --> 22:07.458
from a window well
over a hundred feet away,

22:07.493 --> 22:10.610
you were able to
see my client speed by?

22:10.645 --> 22:12.696
I have very good eyesight.

22:12.737 --> 22:14.477
Don't your nurses have to lay

22:14.489 --> 22:16.116
out your medication
every night

22:16.116 --> 22:17.986
so that you don't
take the wrong pills?

22:17.986 --> 22:20.252
Those pills are so small.

22:20.287 --> 22:21.830
They're right in front of you,

22:21.830 --> 22:23.325
and you can't tell them apart?

22:23.325 --> 22:25.048
I can tell them apart.

22:25.083 --> 22:27.127
What are the
names of the pills?

22:27.162 --> 22:29.094
I don't know or care.

22:29.129 --> 22:31.381
I take what
they tell me to take.

22:31.416 --> 22:33.883
What's my name?

22:34.634 --> 22:36.212
–It's Shirley.
–Shirley what?

22:36.212 --> 22:37.512
–Objection.
–What time do

22:37.512 --> 22:38.763
you typically take your pills?

22:38.763 --> 22:42.058
–8.
–8. You take eight pills every day.

22:42.093 --> 22:43.101
–Yes.
–Objection!

22:43.101 --> 22:44.853
Who is the president
of the United States?

22:44.853 --> 22:45.937
Objection, your honor.

22:45.937 --> 22:47.897
–Overruled.
–What day is it today?

22:47.897 --> 22:50.441
I don't know or
care what day it is.

22:50.525 --> 22:53.444
You don't know what day it is?

22:53.528 --> 22:56.197
How did you get here today?

22:56.281 --> 22:58.116
I…

22:58.199 --> 23:00.743
I took the bus!

23:00.827 --> 23:02.787
You were driven by car.

23:02.870 --> 23:05.415
–What's my name?
–Stop asking me that!

23:05.498 --> 23:07.250
I saw that boy.

23:07.333 --> 23:09.373
–What's that boy's name?
–Shirley!

23:09.377 --> 23:11.421
No, that's my
name, my first name.

23:11.504 --> 23:13.589
–What's my last name?
–I don't know!

23:13.589 --> 23:15.216
I don't know!

23:15.299 --> 23:20.680
Your last name is
whatever it is, damn it!

23:26.352 --> 23:29.480
It's Schmidt.

23:53.838 --> 23:56.549
She couldn't
remember Shirley's name.

23:56.584 --> 24:00.925
Alan, if I'm ever like that…

24:00.960 --> 24:05.266
am I like that now sometimes?

24:05.301 --> 24:07.268
Of course not.

24:07.601 --> 24:09.281
Denny, if you're really this

24:09.311 --> 24:10.931
concerned, you
should get tested.

24:10.931 --> 24:12.106
I did a couple of years ago.

24:12.106 --> 24:16.568
Understood, but to see
if things have progressed.

24:16.652 --> 24:18.572
It could give
you peace of mind.

24:18.612 --> 24:19.613
Or not.

24:19.697 --> 24:22.491
This motion thingy needs to be

24:22.574 --> 24:25.327
signed before we can file it.

24:35.712 --> 24:36.964
Let me get this straight.

24:36.964 --> 24:40.050
She slept with you
because of the nightmares?

24:40.085 --> 24:43.554
Night terrors.
There's a difference.

24:43.971 --> 24:45.639
Wow.

24:47.558 --> 24:50.227
Would you do it with me?

24:50.435 --> 24:51.401
I'm sorry?

24:51.436 --> 24:54.231
If I agreed to get tested,

24:54.266 --> 24:57.234
would you do it, too?

24:59.486 --> 25:02.781
I really don't think I
have Alzheimer's, Denny.

25:02.816 --> 25:04.491
You're afraid of clowns.

25:04.574 --> 25:06.201
You've got the night terrors.

25:06.201 --> 25:09.871
There's something
screwy going on up there.

25:09.906 --> 25:13.542
But the problem
isn't likely neurological.

25:13.576 --> 25:15.836
Oh, okay, I get it.

25:16.086 --> 25:18.588
It was a stupid idea, anyway.

25:18.672 --> 25:19.673
Denny.

25:20.382 --> 25:24.594
Make an appointment.
We'll get tested together.

25:31.977 --> 25:33.436
First of all, we do not admit

25:33.436 --> 25:34.771
that the fat cells harvested

25:34.771 --> 25:37.023
and injected in
your respective lips

25:37.107 --> 25:39.317
were derived from
my client's buttocks.

25:39.317 --> 25:41.361
–That's a horrible opener.
–Horrible. Tori…

25:41.361 --> 25:42.737
That's not settlement talk.

25:42.737 --> 25:44.114
–If I may be
allowed to finish

25:44.114 --> 25:46.616
even assuming the
truth of your allegations…

25:46.616 --> 25:47.867
She's tricky.
Oh, very.

25:47.867 --> 25:49.619
–Tori…
–George…

25:49.702 --> 25:50.995
Ladies, let's hear opposing

25:50.995 --> 25:52.205
counsel before we jump to…

25:52.205 --> 25:54.916
She was supposed
to be our lawyer.

25:54.999 --> 25:56.000
Tori?

25:56.084 --> 25:57.544
My point is, that even had you

25:57.544 --> 25:59.003
known the origin
of the fat cells,

25:59.003 --> 26:00.296
you may very well have

26:00.296 --> 26:01.798
consented to the
injections anyway.

26:01.798 --> 26:04.175
–It's the good stuff.
–Barry!

26:04.259 --> 26:05.927
I'm sorry, but did you just

26:06.010 --> 26:07.595
say what I think you said?

26:07.679 --> 26:09.931
That we would
have said okay to this?

26:10.014 --> 26:11.683
Tori, Kiersten,

26:11.766 --> 26:13.476
there was nothing
in the contract that

26:13.476 --> 26:15.103
stipulated it
would be your own tissue.

26:15.103 --> 26:17.263
All right, this
is nonsense, Denise.

26:17.271 --> 26:18.272
What nonsense.

26:18.356 --> 26:19.899
This is what people do

26:19.982 --> 26:21.609
every day,
especially these two.

26:21.609 --> 26:23.109
They agreed to have human

26:23.111 --> 26:24.570
fat injected in their bodies

26:24.570 --> 26:27.406
or collagen made
from rendered cowskin,

26:27.490 --> 26:29.992
hyaluronic acid
extracted from rooster combs.

26:29.992 --> 26:32.119
They shoot
botulism in their foreheads.

26:32.119 --> 26:33.913
–But we're not
talking about botox

26:33.913 --> 26:36.290
We're talking about
this man's buttocks.

26:36.290 --> 26:39.001
And I agree. It's
not a pretty picture.

26:39.085 --> 26:41.420
But neither are the
blood clots, infections

26:41.420 --> 26:43.673
and scarring you
risk from your tummy tucks

26:43.673 --> 26:45.591
or the bleeding, bruising and

26:45.675 --> 26:47.593
deflation from your
saline breast implants.

26:47.593 --> 26:49.095
How about possible nerve

26:49.178 --> 26:50.763
damage from your face-lifts,

26:50.763 --> 26:53.181
the risk of
blindness from eyelid surgery?

26:53.181 --> 26:57.019
It's all pretty
ugly, but you did it.

26:57.103 --> 26:58.646
You know, Ms Bauer,

26:58.729 --> 27:02.524
you've just painted a pretty
pathetic picture of us,

27:02.608 --> 27:06.028
and maybe we're every bit…

27:06.112 --> 27:09.114
That didn't
give you the right.

27:09.198 --> 27:13.326
We're offering
you $300,000 each.

27:14.411 --> 27:16.151
Now you might get more if you

27:16.163 --> 27:17.866
go to trial,
but you might not,

27:17.866 --> 27:19.546
given your propensity to say

27:19.583 --> 27:21.390
yes to any and
every procedure.

27:21.390 --> 27:23.212
My client is
also willing to treat

27:23.212 --> 27:24.915
you for free for
the rest of your lives.

27:24.915 --> 27:26.006
You might not want to have

27:26.006 --> 27:27.216
anything to do with him now,

27:27.216 --> 27:29.885
but given that
he is reputedly the

27:29.968 --> 27:32.596
best cosmetic
plastic surgeon in Boston,

27:32.680 --> 27:34.807
money and
services, this is an offer

27:34.807 --> 27:36.850
potentially worth more
than a million dollars.

27:36.850 --> 27:42.272
But if you go public or sue,
the offer is rescinded.

27:49.696 --> 27:51.657
She has Alzheimer's disease.

27:51.697 --> 27:53.450
She has trouble remembering a

27:53.534 --> 27:55.279
lot of things,
including names,

27:55.279 --> 27:56.662
little things.

27:56.745 --> 27:59.331
But catastrophic events,

27:59.414 --> 28:01.875
traumatic ones, those sink in.

28:01.959 --> 28:04.503
Which is why she
remains steadfast that

28:04.585 --> 28:07.089
Jason Matheny was
driving the car that night.

28:07.089 --> 28:08.507
And consider this.

28:08.590 --> 28:10.509
If Jason weren't
driving that night,

28:10.509 --> 28:12.928
what a monumental
coincidence then that

28:13.011 --> 28:15.411
Lydia picked him
out of a police lineup.

28:15.430 --> 28:17.140
She just
happened to pick the guy

28:17.140 --> 28:18.767
who owned the
offending vehicle.

28:18.767 --> 28:19.976
Please!

28:20.060 --> 28:21.728
Lydia picked out the defendant

28:21.728 --> 28:23.230
because she saw him that

28:23.313 --> 28:24.815
night through the windshield,

28:24.815 --> 28:26.691
and that's not
changed by the fact

28:26.691 --> 28:31.446
she had trouble remembering
Shirley Schmidt's name.

28:40.705 --> 28:43.548
I don't doubt she
remembered Jason's face.

28:43.583 --> 28:46.433
The police picked him
up as the owner of the car,

28:46.433 --> 28:49.214
plopped him in a
lineup and brought Lydia in.

28:49.249 --> 28:51.424
Now we can't know whether the

28:51.508 --> 28:53.600
police nudged
or influenced Lydia

28:53.635 --> 28:56.172
to select the man they
felt committed the crime,

28:56.172 --> 28:58.681
but it's been known to happen,

28:58.716 --> 29:01.100
especially with a witness

29:01.142 --> 29:03.443
who needs a little assistance.

29:03.478 --> 29:06.439
And that's where
Lydia's Alzheimer's comes in.

29:06.474 --> 29:09.209
Her brain plays tricks on her.

29:09.243 --> 29:11.945
She takes
Jason's face from the

29:12.028 --> 29:14.948
lineup and
transfers it to the car.

29:14.989 --> 29:19.285
Stage four Alzheimer's is a
form of dementia.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.496
We have an eyewitness who not

29:21.578 --> 29:23.629
only couldn't
remember my name,

29:23.664 --> 29:26.119
she didn't know what
day of the week it was,

29:26.119 --> 29:28.332
thought she had
come here by bus

29:28.367 --> 29:30.546
when she had
been driven by car.

29:30.581 --> 29:34.634
She suffers from dementia.

29:35.426 --> 29:38.721
I know we all feel
for her. How could we not?

29:38.756 --> 29:41.230
She's adorable,

29:41.265 --> 29:43.524
seemingly trustworthy,

29:43.559 --> 29:46.187
and our hearts
have to go out to anyone

29:46.222 --> 29:48.571
who has this
insidious disease.

29:48.606 --> 29:53.944
One day we or someone
we know will be her.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.364
More than 1.5 million

29:56.447 --> 29:58.442
Americans suffer
from Alzheimer's.

29:58.442 --> 30:00.951
By the year 2015, that number

30:01.035 --> 30:03.537
could increase to 14 million.

30:03.621 --> 30:07.333
This is not
someone else's disease.

30:07.416 --> 30:12.463
It has or will affect
every single one of us.

30:12.546 --> 30:16.842
And of course, our
heart goes out to Lydia.

30:16.926 --> 30:21.222
But this trial is
about proving guilt

30:21.305 --> 30:25.309
beyond all reasonable doubt,

30:25.392 --> 30:28.270
and that hasn't happened here.

30:28.354 --> 30:30.689
All the
prosecution has given you

30:30.773 --> 30:34.485
is a lone witness who

30:34.568 --> 30:38.238
suffers from
terminal dementia.

30:38.781 --> 30:43.202
Beyond all reasonable doubt?

30:44.620 --> 30:46.872
You know better.

31:15.067 --> 31:16.526
Alan?

31:18.737 --> 31:21.031
Alan, what are you…

31:21.066 --> 31:22.199
Alan!

31:22.824 --> 31:24.993
Whoa, whoa. Do you hear me?

31:26.620 --> 31:28.205
Alan!

31:28.663 --> 31:30.165
Alan!

31:30.332 --> 31:31.458
Oh, God.

31:31.625 --> 31:32.626
Oh, God.

31:32.709 --> 31:33.793
Oh, God.

31:33.877 --> 31:36.630
Okay, okay, here we go.

31:36.713 --> 31:38.882
Alan, Alan!

31:38.965 --> 31:41.134
Okay, Alan, okay.

31:41.217 --> 31:42.597
Alan, come back to bed.

31:42.677 --> 31:43.678
Calm down.

31:43.762 --> 31:45.305
Everything's all right, Alan.

31:45.305 --> 31:46.848
Everything's all
right! You're safe!

31:46.848 --> 31:48.767
You're safe, Alan!

31:48.850 --> 31:51.061
Okay? That's right.

31:51.144 --> 31:52.812
I'm here now, okay?

31:52.896 --> 31:54.564
I'm here.

31:54.647 --> 31:56.649
Everything's gonna be okay.

31:56.733 --> 31:58.651
Okay, you hear me now?

31:58.735 --> 32:00.236
All right?

32:00.320 --> 32:02.155
I'm here, okay?

32:02.238 --> 32:04.491
Okay, you're safe.

32:04.574 --> 32:07.368
Okay, okay.

32:07.452 --> 32:10.205
That's good. No, no worries.

32:10.288 --> 32:12.373
Nothing's wrong.

32:12.457 --> 32:16.127
Okay, okay.

32:16.210 --> 32:21.090
Yeah, yeah, just relax.

32:22.842 --> 32:24.475
I'm here.

32:24.510 --> 32:27.638
I'm not going anywhere.

32:36.105 --> 32:37.356
You'll hear a knocking sound

32:37.356 --> 32:38.649
while we're taking the images.

32:38.649 --> 32:42.111
The main thing is,
remain as still as possible.

32:42.195 --> 32:44.489
Why couldn't
Alan have gone first?

32:44.572 --> 32:46.824
I'm right over here, Denny.

32:46.908 --> 32:49.160
Okay, still as possible, sir.

32:52.079 --> 32:54.165
–You doing okay?
–Fine.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.585
Here we go. Still.

32:58.419 --> 33:00.921
Maybe I should
have removed my…

33:01.464 --> 33:03.507
watch.

33:05.801 --> 33:07.470
Okay.

33:09.555 --> 33:12.349
Your glutamate
levels are about the same.

33:12.384 --> 33:14.608
So is the evidence of plaque.

33:14.643 --> 33:17.389
–But nothing's got worse?
–I don't believe so.

33:17.389 --> 33:19.248
You do show precursors,

33:19.283 --> 33:21.108
so it's important that you

33:21.192 --> 33:22.853
continue to
exercise your brain,

33:22.853 --> 33:24.445
different areas of the brain.

33:24.445 --> 33:27.274
Try writing with your other
hand, do the crosswords.

33:27.274 --> 33:30.784
Is it possible I
have mad cow disease?

33:30.819 --> 33:32.543
We can't rule it out.

33:32.578 --> 33:35.087
They do have some
identical symptoms.

33:35.122 --> 33:36.992
There could be
countless numbers of people

33:36.992 --> 33:38.912
we've diagnosed
with Alzheimer's

33:38.917 --> 33:40.753
who really have
mad cow disease.

33:40.753 --> 33:42.171
See?

33:42.921 --> 33:43.922
Do him now.

33:44.006 --> 33:46.508
I'm afraid a
PET scan isn't going

33:46.592 --> 33:49.011
to tell us why
he's afraid of clowns.

33:49.094 --> 33:51.638
What about the night terrors?
He had one last night.

33:51.638 --> 33:53.932
–Again…
–That's okay. I can come

33:54.016 --> 33:56.226
back later after
a few hamburgers.

33:56.310 --> 33:58.896
You promised
you'd get tested, too.

33:58.979 --> 34:00.899
Denny, those
machines can't test

34:00.939 --> 34:02.816
for the stuff
I've got going on.

34:02.816 --> 34:05.569
–You tricked me.
–Hey, Denny.

34:05.652 --> 34:08.196
You haven't gotten worse.

34:12.743 --> 34:15.620
They agreed to all the terms?

34:15.655 --> 34:18.463
Confidentiality, all of it?

34:18.498 --> 34:20.898
Apparently the
offer of free laser peels

34:20.958 --> 34:23.288
in perpetuity was
just too good to pass up.

34:23.288 --> 34:25.464
You dodged a
nuclear bullet, Barry.

34:25.498 --> 34:26.672
Thank you.

34:26.757 --> 34:28.317
That still leaves open the

34:28.382 --> 34:29.967
question as to
whether I will sue you.

34:29.967 --> 34:31.928
Denise, I am so sorry.

34:32.012 --> 34:33.804
I just want to know why.

34:33.889 --> 34:37.516
Why would you risk
your career, your…

34:37.601 --> 34:39.895
I don't understand.

34:39.978 --> 34:43.063
Look at my face.

34:43.148 --> 34:45.065
In high school,

34:45.150 --> 34:48.570
everybody called me “fat ass.”

34:48.652 --> 34:51.572
I think the idea that it could

34:51.656 --> 34:54.534
ever be
associated with beauty…

34:54.617 --> 34:58.496
I'm obsessed
with beauty, Denise,

34:58.580 --> 35:01.833
obsessed with the
thought that these

35:01.916 --> 35:05.044
beautiful women
would be walking around

35:05.128 --> 35:09.340
with a tiny bit of
Barry Glouberman inside them

35:09.424 --> 35:13.720
and that when people
look at them and admire them,

35:13.803 --> 35:18.099
they'd be admiring a

35:18.182 --> 35:22.437
microscopic
fraction of my physicality.

35:23.563 --> 35:25.815
You need help.

35:26.232 --> 35:28.109
If you do not
agree to get help,

35:28.109 --> 35:30.737
I will do so much
worse than sue you.

35:30.772 --> 35:33.406
You could go to jail.

35:33.573 --> 35:36.013
I'm not kidding, Barry.

35:36.048 --> 35:38.453
I will see you in jail.

35:39.954 --> 35:42.540
I give you my word.

35:50.798 --> 35:53.342
The defendant
will please rise.

35:55.887 --> 35:57.346
Madame foreperson, have you

35:57.346 --> 35:58.681
reached a unanimous verdict?

35:58.681 --> 36:01.315
–We have, your honor.
–What say you?

36:01.350 --> 36:04.221
In the matter of the
commonwealth vs Jason Matheny

36:04.221 --> 36:06.414
on the charge of
vehicular homicide,

36:06.449 --> 36:08.607
we find the
defendant Jason Matheny

36:08.642 --> 36:11.152
not guilty.

36:11.402 --> 36:12.820
Members of the jury, the

36:12.820 --> 36:14.280
court thanks you
for your service.

36:14.280 --> 36:17.408
You are hereby excused.

36:19.076 --> 36:21.996
–Thank you, Shirley.
–You're welcome.

36:22.496 --> 36:23.876
Congratulations, Jason.

36:23.908 --> 36:26.083
Yeah, thanks.

36:27.585 --> 36:29.399
So uh…

36:29.434 --> 36:31.213
that's it?

36:31.505 --> 36:33.924
That's it.

36:44.685 --> 36:46.270
Lydia…

36:46.854 --> 36:49.898
I know what I did was…

36:51.191 --> 36:52.658
it's my job.

36:52.693 --> 36:56.697
Yes, your job
was to secure the

36:56.780 --> 37:00.701
freedom of a boy
who killed somebody.

37:02.244 --> 37:04.496
I…

37:07.207 --> 37:09.341
wish you well.

37:09.376 --> 37:13.463
You too, Ms Schmidt.

37:15.716 --> 37:17.335
I'm sure by this time tomorrow

37:17.335 --> 37:19.219
she won't have any memory

37:19.261 --> 37:21.138
of how despicable you were.

37:21.221 --> 37:25.017
Can I buy you dinner
or something, Shirley?

37:25.100 --> 37:28.270
–Some other time, thank you.
–The thing is,

37:28.854 --> 37:32.190
I'm having
these night terrors.

37:32.225 --> 37:35.527
I'm afraid to
be alone at night.

37:47.330 --> 37:49.970
I don't doubt that
you're afraid, but, Alan,

37:49.993 --> 37:51.876
as much as I
appreciate you vesting

37:51.876 --> 37:56.089
so much responsibility
so early into my job, I…

37:56.124 --> 37:57.804
I just can't handle being in

37:57.841 --> 37:59.461
charge of saving your life.

37:59.467 --> 38:03.595
After last night, I don't
think I could fall asleep.

38:03.631 --> 38:05.432
Okay.

38:06.766 --> 38:09.067
Thank you, Melissa.

38:09.102 --> 38:13.148
You may very well have
saved my life last night.

38:15.942 --> 38:17.944
I know.

38:21.573 --> 38:27.453
You're a really
weird man, aren't you?

38:27.488 --> 38:29.706
It seems so.

38:55.105 --> 38:56.656
Asleep?

38:56.691 --> 38:59.575
Sort of. Difficult day.

38:59.610 --> 39:03.072
I wish I could say there's
been improvement but…

39:18.962 --> 39:20.923
Hey, dad.

39:21.382 --> 39:23.467
It's Shirley.

39:41.402 --> 39:45.364
I won my case in court today.

39:45.572 --> 39:49.243
Not my finest hour.

39:51.036 --> 39:54.998
Not even close.

40:00.295 --> 40:05.050
Well, what
shall we read tonight?

40:08.220 --> 40:11.744
How about “A
tale of two cities”?

40:11.779 --> 40:15.269
We haven't read
that one in a while.

40:20.190 --> 40:22.484
“It was the best of times,

40:22.567 --> 40:24.882
it was the worst of times,”

40:24.917 --> 40:27.197
“It was the age of wisdom, it

40:27.280 --> 40:29.928
was the age of foolishness,”

40:29.963 --> 40:32.577
“It was the
season of light”…

40:48.093 --> 40:49.100
It isn't right.

40:49.135 --> 40:51.054
I tried that night terror

40:51.137 --> 40:53.014
routine on six
different women.

40:53.049 --> 40:54.481
No takers?

40:54.516 --> 40:56.309
It isn't right.

40:58.895 --> 41:00.397
Thanks for coming with me

41:00.480 --> 41:02.711
today. Thanks
for making me do it.

41:02.746 --> 41:04.943
I've always
felt friends should

41:05.026 --> 41:07.987
encourage friends to
have their heads examined.

41:08.022 --> 41:10.156
You okay?

41:10.407 --> 41:14.911
Melissa quit her
moonlighting job.

41:17.872 --> 41:20.667
You're really scared.

41:21.209 --> 41:23.878
Just concerned.

41:23.913 --> 41:26.548
Not to worry.

41:26.798 --> 41:28.848
Oh, all right.

41:28.883 --> 41:30.385
I'll sleep with you in

41:30.468 --> 41:31.963
your room, but not in the bed.

41:31.963 --> 41:33.388
Denny, you sleep like a log.

41:33.388 --> 41:36.148
I'd have to step on
your head for you to stir.

41:36.175 --> 41:38.434
Tie a rope around me.

41:38.935 --> 41:42.438
–You mean it?
–It'll be like a sleepover.

41:42.473 --> 41:44.499
Friends have sleepovers.

41:44.534 --> 41:46.491
We could watch a movie.

41:46.526 --> 41:48.368
–Popcorn.
–Root beer floats.

41:48.403 --> 41:51.155
–Tell ghost stories.
–Talk about girls.

41:51.190 --> 41:53.116
Yeah.

41:53.825 --> 41:56.160
Pretend we're kids.

41:58.246 --> 42:01.039
Pretend we're kids.
