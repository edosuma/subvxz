00:01.000 --> 00:02.270
Previously on
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:02.303 --> 00:03.537
Whoever this Josh Chan is,

00:03.570 --> 00:05.539
you are,
you're obsessed with him.

00:05.573 --> 00:06.607
So you're saying that
I moved here from New York

00:06.640 --> 00:08.676
and I left behind a job
 that would've paid me

00:08.709 --> 00:11.112
$545,000 a year for a guy

00:11.145 --> 00:14.082
I dated for two months
 when I was 16 at a summer camp?

00:14.115 --> 00:16.084
I did not do that.
What's the deal
with you and Josh?

00:16.117 --> 00:17.385
Josh isn't my type.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.721
But, like, speaking of types,

00:20.754 --> 00:23.357
like, what type's
his girlfriend?
I should go.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.492
Did you see this résumé?

00:24.525 --> 00:25.693
Harvard? Yale?

00:25.726 --> 00:27.395
What the hell is she doing here?

00:27.428 --> 00:30.264
* I was working hard
at a New York job *

00:30.298 --> 00:32.133
* Making dough
but it made me blue *

00:32.165 --> 00:33.667
* One day I was crying a lot

00:33.701 --> 00:35.069
* And so I decided to move

00:35.103 --> 00:36.637
* To West Covina, California

00:36.670 --> 00:37.838
* Brand new pals
and new career *

00:37.871 --> 00:40.241
* It happens to be
where Josh lives *

00:40.274 --> 00:42.776
* But that's not why I'm here

00:42.810 --> 00:44.778
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *
What? No, I'm not.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.514
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

00:46.547 --> 00:48.082
That's a sexist term.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.083
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

00:49.117 --> 00:50.551
Can you guys stop singing
for just a second?

00:50.584 --> 00:53.121
* She's so broken inside *

00:53.154 --> 00:54.522
The situation's a lot more
nuanced than that.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.524
* C-R-A-Z-Y *

00:56.557 --> 00:57.825
Okay! We get it!

00:57.858 --> 01:00.294
* Crazy ex-girlfriend. *

01:01.729 --> 01:03.697
REBECCA:
Ugh...

01:03.731 --> 01:04.864
It's so hot.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.400
Is it always this hot?

01:06.434 --> 01:07.668
Yeah.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.803
You're getting a sexy
SoCal farmer's tan.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.572
Now, that's
a good look.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.141
So I've been thinking
about it...
Yes?

01:13.174 --> 01:14.742
And there
could be, like,

01:14.775 --> 01:17.111
a million reasons why
Josh hasn't texted me back.

01:17.145 --> 01:19.113
Look, he specifically
wrote in his text:

01:19.147 --> 01:21.715
"Want to grab dinner?
Smiley face."

01:21.749 --> 01:23.684
Which is the least
he can do, since you left

01:23.717 --> 01:25.819
your great job and moved
to this dump to be with him.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.688
Hey! I didn't move here
for him, remember?

01:27.721 --> 01:29.157
I moved here because
I needed a change

01:29.190 --> 01:30.191
and Josh just
happens to be here.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.559
Get it straight.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.462
Oh, are we still doing that?
Okay.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.430
All right, just let me know
when we can stop, because

01:36.464 --> 01:37.698
I actually want
to know what's keeping him

01:37.731 --> 01:39.167
from having dinner
with his dear old friend

01:39.200 --> 01:41.535
from summer camp.
I don't know.

01:41.569 --> 01:44.172
What are you...
Don't do that.
Let's see what
he's been up to.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.473
Let's see what he's been up to.
You can't take a person's
personal electronic...

01:45.506 --> 01:46.907
I just did.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.809
Oh, look at this.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.578
What? Wait, wait, wait.
Has he updated his status

01:50.611 --> 01:51.745
in the last 20 minutes?

01:51.779 --> 01:53.347
Not that I've been
checking, I was...

01:53.381 --> 01:55.649
Checking?
Oh, that is amateur hour.

01:55.683 --> 01:57.685
You gotta change
your push notifications. Look.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.920
He is going to
a club called Spiders

01:59.953 --> 02:01.689
with his friends
tonight.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.691
And so, we will, too.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.593
Spiders. I drove by there
the other night.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.827
It was hopping.

02:06.860 --> 02:07.895
But I always
wonder, though,

02:07.928 --> 02:08.929
is it possessive Spider's

02:08.961 --> 02:09.863
or plural Spiders?

02:09.896 --> 02:11.799
Because every time
I see a flyer for it,

02:11.832 --> 02:13.701
the apostrophe's
in a different location.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.236
What difference
does it make?

02:15.269 --> 02:16.370
It doesn't make a difference,
it's just, like,

02:16.404 --> 02:17.338
it's two different things.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.607
Like, either the club
is owned by a spider

02:19.640 --> 02:21.742
or the club is filled with,
like, a bunch of spiders.

02:21.775 --> 02:22.710
So... it's a different thing.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.478
Okay, let's go back
to what you were saying.

02:24.512 --> 02:25.579
You know what?

02:25.613 --> 02:26.580
I actually
really like your idea.

02:26.614 --> 02:27.381
Let's go to Spider's tonight.

02:27.415 --> 02:28.882
(gasps)
Just, like,
as a gal date.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.484
Like, not-not 'cause
Josh is there.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.785
In fact, I hope
Josh isn't there,

02:31.819 --> 02:34.622
so that when I do my sexy

02:34.655 --> 02:36.290
dance moves,
it's just for me.

02:36.324 --> 02:37.725
It's just for me.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.593
(dance music playing)

02:42.796 --> 02:43.764
Oh!

02:43.797 --> 02:45.366
Hey!

02:45.399 --> 02:46.900
Hi. Cool hat.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.369
Hats are the new tattoos.

02:48.402 --> 02:49.303
Oh, yeah, I read that.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.371
Let's go find Josh.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.939
Okay, well,
you can find Josh

02:51.972 --> 02:53.541
and I'll be in there
just checking out

02:53.574 --> 02:55.376
the local indigenous culture.
Uh-huh.

02:55.409 --> 02:56.910
Well, while you're
in there chatting

02:56.944 --> 02:58.579
about the majestic history
of the 10 freeway,

02:58.612 --> 03:00.414
I'm gonna be
asking Josh Chan

03:00.448 --> 03:02.216
why he's been
dodging you.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.818
See, now, there it's possessive.

03:07.821 --> 03:08.789
PAULA:
Yo...

03:08.822 --> 03:10.424
You see my hat?

03:10.458 --> 03:11.825
It's like a tattoo,

03:11.859 --> 03:14.295
but on my head.

03:14.328 --> 03:15.829
(whispers):
Let us in.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.698
You on the list,
Mrs. Butterworth?

03:17.731 --> 03:19.767
I don't care for that tone--

03:19.800 --> 03:21.535
or that reference.
Okay.
Um, I... I...

03:21.569 --> 03:22.770
I got this. Sorry.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.672
Sorry, she doesn't know
about club culture.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.475
Um... I should've
done this earlier,

03:27.508 --> 03:30.010
it's more suave,
but... let us in?

03:30.043 --> 03:31.812
Thank you.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.881
Yo, this is $500.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.616
Um... yeah.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.884
Yeah, it is.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.287
Look, if this had been a 20,
you'd be good.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.789
But either you're a cop
or you're a drug dealer.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.491
Either way,
y'all ain't getting in.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.694
Okay.

03:46.727 --> 03:47.695
Okay...

03:47.728 --> 03:49.463
Okay.
Yeah.

03:49.497 --> 03:50.798
No, not tonight. No.

03:50.831 --> 03:51.832
Oh, see...
Hey, hey.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.000
Come on. Come on.
Come on, come on.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.468
You gonna get runs
in your stockings

03:54.502 --> 03:55.903
and all that stuff, man,
you don't want that.

03:55.936 --> 03:56.904
Gotta keep moving.
Come on.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.339
Okay.
All right.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.340
I'm sorry,
not tonight.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.541
Just-- easy,
easy, killer.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.743
All right.
You know.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.712
All right. Well, if we're
not getting in the club,

04:04.745 --> 04:05.646
do you want to...

04:05.679 --> 04:07.315
do you want to hang out,
do something else?

04:07.348 --> 04:08.449
Ooh!

04:08.482 --> 04:09.883
There's a new Olive
Garden in Arcadia.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.285
They're still figuring
out their portions.

04:11.319 --> 04:12.386
Nah, I don't...

04:12.420 --> 04:13.721
I kind of want to just
call it a night.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.556
No-- oh, come on, man.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.690
I got a pass.

04:16.724 --> 04:17.991
I told Scott
I was gonna be

04:18.024 --> 04:19.459
out all night
having my period.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.329
He asked me
no questions.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.530
(whines)

04:22.563 --> 04:23.864
I just, you know...

04:23.897 --> 04:25.333
coming from New York,

04:25.366 --> 04:27.668
a quiet night is a luxury.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.403
Can we take a rain check?
All right.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.639
I like alone time.

04:31.672 --> 04:32.973
No...

04:33.006 --> 04:35.643
I love alone time.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.945
*

04:46.454 --> 04:49.823
And it was then
the Fuhrer decided upon

04:49.857 --> 04:51.525
the Final Solution.

04:53.361 --> 04:54.962
What are you doing?

04:54.995 --> 04:56.997
*

05:10.411 --> 05:12.746
(exhales)

05:21.154 --> 05:25.859
MAN (over P.A.):
Uh, Danny, could I get a price
check on, uh, pork rinds?

05:25.893 --> 05:27.895
Price check on pork rinds.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.500
(fairy tale music playing)

05:33.967 --> 05:38.706
REBECCA:
 Josh-osh-osh-osh.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.923
Can I help you, ma'am?

05:57.558 --> 05:59.092
No, I'm fine.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.828
I'm just watching
my ex-boyfriend

06:00.861 --> 06:02.730
make out with
the hottest girl I've ever seen.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.898
Ah, she's okay.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.634
No...

06:06.667 --> 06:08.101
You know what?

06:08.135 --> 06:09.937
She's smoking.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.171
Oh, yeah, I see it now.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.007
She's got one of
them secret booties.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.076
Oh, does he know
you still dig him?

06:16.109 --> 06:18.011
He's just a friend!

06:18.045 --> 06:20.781
Sorry. It's a long story.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.155
Oh!
Whoa, whoa!

06:28.188 --> 06:29.423
Whoa. Sor...

06:29.457 --> 06:31.592
(sighs)

06:31.625 --> 06:33.427
Hey.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.929
Wow.

06:35.963 --> 06:38.832
Um... so I-I texted you
after the party,

06:38.866 --> 06:39.933
but I didn't hear back.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.201
Yeah, I'm sorry.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.936
I've been really busy with work.
Seriously, though,

06:42.970 --> 06:44.605
now that I have you here,

06:44.638 --> 06:45.939
could we maybe have a postmortem

06:45.973 --> 06:47.441
on the whole
makeout-crying session?

06:47.475 --> 06:49.209
I really don't think
it's the time

06:49.242 --> 06:50.978
or the place. I...

06:51.011 --> 06:52.112
Wow.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.213
Dude, they got
Twizzlers.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.749
Throwback!
That's great.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.518
Um, Rebecca,

06:57.551 --> 06:59.520
let me introduce you
to these two fine gentlemen.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.590
This is Hector,
203rd best surfer in the state.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.024
202nd.
GREG:
Great.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.158
And this is White Josh,

07:05.192 --> 07:06.460
so named because
he looks just like Josh,

07:06.494 --> 07:07.595
except for he's white.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.863
Also, my...
my name is also Josh.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.098
Mmm.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.066
Well, we've all met.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.769
Um, hopefully the next time,
I'll be...

07:15.803 --> 07:16.904
Better looking?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.606
Thanks.
He doesn't mean that.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.040
Uh... it's fine.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.042
Um, I will text you
at some point,

07:22.075 --> 07:24.044
I just... I-I really...
I have to...

07:24.077 --> 07:25.979
Okay.
Yeah.
I have to go.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.815
Bras are in aisle one.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.617
(guys chuckling)

07:29.650 --> 07:30.918
That's really nice.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.052
It's, like,
only $5.26.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.054
That's not that bad.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.023
Um, I think the ice cream
is down here.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.157
What are you
talking about, Joshy?

07:37.190 --> 07:38.158
It's right in
front of you.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.494
Are you okay?

07:40.528 --> 07:43.196
Wait, why is Greg
talking to a homeless?

07:44.765 --> 07:46.934
Oh, hi, Rebecca.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.802
Hey.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.638
You know each other?

07:50.671 --> 07:53.741
Yeah, uh, this is
my friend Rebecca.

07:53.774 --> 07:54.775
We, um,

07:54.808 --> 07:57.210
met at summer camp,
like, a million, billion,

07:57.244 --> 07:59.813
trillion, like,
a zillion years ago.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.114
Summer camp?

08:01.148 --> 08:02.550
You guys met in summer camp?

08:02.583 --> 08:04.785
Yeah, we were like...
like, eight years old.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.687
Right, Rebecca?

08:06.720 --> 08:07.287
No, we were...

08:08.989 --> 08:10.624
We were eight and a half.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.159
That was very
important to me

08:12.192 --> 08:13.961
when I was eight.
I'm eight and a half!

08:13.994 --> 08:14.995
You know. Kids.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.565
Uh, this is Valencia.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.832
My girlfriend.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.300
Hi.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.935
Nice to meet you.
Oh.
Hi.

08:26.674 --> 08:27.841
My lady.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.643
GREG:
I'm confused.

08:29.677 --> 08:30.911
You don't know each other
from New York?

08:30.944 --> 08:31.945
No.
Nope.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.746
Wait.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.148
How do you guys know each other?

08:35.182 --> 08:36.650
(laughs)
Oh, we, um,

08:36.683 --> 08:38.284
met at Home Base, um,

08:38.318 --> 08:40.854
and then we just became,
like, cazh buds,

08:40.888 --> 08:43.123
and, yeah, that's-that's just,
that's what happened.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.726
Valencia,
that's such a beautiful name.

08:45.759 --> 08:46.994
What's the origin of that?

08:47.027 --> 08:48.261
Well, it used
to be Maria,

08:48.295 --> 08:50.030
but I never felt
like a Maria

08:50.063 --> 08:53.266
so I changed it to my mother's
maiden name: "Valencia."

08:53.300 --> 08:55.168
It's the Spanish word
for "brave."

08:55.202 --> 08:56.203
That's really cool.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.705
Actually, I thought
about doing the same thing

08:57.738 --> 08:58.739
with my mother's maiden name.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.140
Um, it's "Garfinkel,"

09:00.173 --> 09:02.142
which is the Yiddish word
for "diamond dealer."

09:02.175 --> 09:03.611
Um...

09:03.644 --> 09:05.245
God, I love that dress.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.580
Can I just say, like,

09:06.614 --> 09:08.048
I cannot wear
dresses like that,

09:08.081 --> 09:11.318
and you pull it off so, so well.

09:11.351 --> 09:14.287
I mean, you are...
you're just so pretty.

09:14.321 --> 09:15.589
I mean, you have
a great body.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.124
Well, I teach yoga.
Keeps me fit.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.626
Oh, my God, I love yoga!

09:18.659 --> 09:20.160
That's so funny
that we're meeting right now,

09:20.193 --> 09:21.194
'cause I love yoga.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.362
You do?

09:22.395 --> 09:23.664
Yeah, I-I love it.

09:23.697 --> 09:24.665
Well, maybe you
should come

09:24.698 --> 09:25.666
to one of my classes.

09:25.699 --> 09:26.700
I would love that!

09:26.734 --> 09:28.769
I would love
to have you!
I would love to be had!

09:28.802 --> 09:30.070
(whispering):
Why are their voices so high?

09:30.103 --> 09:31.104
REBECCA:
Cool.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.340
Well, God, this has
just been the best night.

09:33.373 --> 09:34.875
It was so great
meeting you.

09:34.908 --> 09:38.912
I'm just going
to gracefully exeunt,

09:38.946 --> 09:41.915
pursued by a bear.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.851
Uh, hey, I'll be right back.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.285
Can you get me
two more pints?

09:45.318 --> 09:46.920
Oh, my God, she's so pretty,
oh, my God, she's so pretty,

09:46.954 --> 09:49.322
oh, my God, she's so pretty, oh,
my God, she's so pretty.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.724
Hi.

09:50.758 --> 09:51.725
Hey.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.160
What was up with that
"eight years old" thing?

09:53.193 --> 09:54.862
We were 16 when we were at camp.

09:54.895 --> 09:55.863
No biggie.
Just, uh...

09:55.896 --> 09:57.765
the thing with us at camp,
no one knows that,

09:57.798 --> 09:59.132
especially Valencia,

09:59.166 --> 10:00.233
so let's just keep it
on the DL.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.703
Is this because
I look like a homeless?
No, just,

10:02.736 --> 10:04.805
Valencia, she sometimes
sweats these things.

10:04.838 --> 10:05.806
You get it.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.675
Wait...

10:07.708 --> 10:09.710
Is that the reason you haven't
gotten back to me about dinner?

10:09.743 --> 10:11.879
Come on, dude.

10:11.912 --> 10:12.913
I'm no threat!

10:12.946 --> 10:13.914
Look at her!

10:13.947 --> 10:14.915
Look at me!

10:14.948 --> 10:16.950
Her! Me!

10:16.984 --> 10:18.251
Yoga! Homeless!

10:18.285 --> 10:20.387
And I...
I have no problem with her.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.822
I think she's terrific.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.256
I mean, did you see how we...

10:23.290 --> 10:24.692
we instantly bonded?
Actually, I...

10:24.725 --> 10:25.959
I would like
to be friends with her.

10:25.993 --> 10:26.960
What? No.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.128
That's not a good idea.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.130
I don't think you guys
should be friends

10:30.163 --> 10:31.965
or anything
like that.
Okay, okay.
No, you're right, you're right.

10:31.999 --> 10:32.966
I am.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.134
Just chill, okay?

10:34.167 --> 10:36.069
Okay.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.404
Anyway,

10:37.437 --> 10:39.339
I got to roll.
Catch you later.
Oh, okay.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.308
I'll catch you...

10:41.341 --> 10:43.276
Hey, Val?
I got your chin.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.445
I got
your chin.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.080
What are you doing?

11:02.896 --> 11:04.898
(computer chimes)

11:06.934 --> 11:08.936
(chuckles)

11:20.213 --> 11:21.849
Josh's girlfriend
is so nice.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.417
Like, so nice.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.119
Like, stop being this nice.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.255
You are so pretty.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.957
So, I got provisions for us

11:29.990 --> 11:31.391
for while we work
on this arbitration,

11:31.424 --> 11:33.794
because it is going to be...

11:33.827 --> 11:35.963
(laughs):
a long day.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.197
First...

11:37.230 --> 11:39.366
Mama got you
the strawberry donuts

11:39.399 --> 11:41.368
that you like from the place
around the corner.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.203
(squeals)
And...

11:43.236 --> 11:46.173
look at what I found
at the car wash.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.507
Sh-bam!

11:47.540 --> 11:50.210
It's a Statue of Liberty
key chain.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.979
'Cause you're from New York.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.480
Do you get it?

11:53.513 --> 11:55.248
Do you, do you like it?

11:55.282 --> 11:56.316
Yeah, no...
(stammers)

11:56.349 --> 11:58.085
I'm sorry, I love it, yeah!

11:58.118 --> 11:59.486
Oh, that's so sweet.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.121
I don't have anything for you.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.455
Put it on your keys!

12:02.489 --> 12:04.091
Okay, yeah.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.392
No, I mean, like, right now!

12:05.425 --> 12:07.094
'Cause I want to,
I want to watch it happen!

12:07.127 --> 12:09.129
Oh, okay.

12:10.798 --> 12:11.999
Ah, I'm sorry.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.834
I'm sorry,
I always wanted a daughter.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.969
I didn't, my-my kids
are not daughters.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.905
They're terrible.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.372
I'll-I'll tell you
about it later.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.473
Or now.

12:20.507 --> 12:21.541
So, Valencia's interests

12:21.574 --> 12:23.010
include tempeh patties,

12:23.043 --> 12:25.045
and Vampire Weekend.

12:25.078 --> 12:28.048
I just feel like
we have so much in common.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.883
What's Vampire Weekend?

12:29.917 --> 12:32.285
Um, it's a weekend
away with vampires.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.387
(chuckles)
I'm pretty sure it's not that.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.889
No, I-I read about it
in The New Yorker.

12:35.923 --> 12:36.857
It's very popular.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.525
Let me see her picture.
Let me see her face.

12:38.558 --> 12:39.993
Here, take a look, see?

12:40.027 --> 12:42.062
PAULA:
Whoa-ho-ho!

12:42.095 --> 12:44.798
She is smoking!

12:44.832 --> 12:46.399
So pretty, right?

12:46.433 --> 12:48.468
And Josh says I can't
be friends with her,

12:48.501 --> 12:50.070
but I really like her.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.072
(laughs)
Come on.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.075
You loathe her.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.277
Um, no, I don't.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.445
Oh, okay!

12:58.478 --> 13:00.113
Let me tell you how this works.

13:00.147 --> 13:03.316
Women of equal sexual viability
hate each other.

13:03.350 --> 13:07.087
Even if they pretend
to like each other.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.588
And that is how it has worked

13:08.621 --> 13:11.258
since the day vaginas
were invented.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.325
See, okay, look.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.494
You're like these two,
all right?

13:14.527 --> 13:16.396
You're Taylor Swift
and she's Katy Perry.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.198
Oh, wait a minute--
maybe you're Katy Perry.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.167
No! No, you're Taylor Swift.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.234
You're uptight and weird, right?

13:21.268 --> 13:23.603
Okay, this is why
I don't read this drivel, right?

13:23.636 --> 13:25.873
Because it perpetuates
the very misogynist myth

13:25.906 --> 13:27.941
that women
can't get along, right?

13:27.975 --> 13:29.542
Look at this cover!

13:29.576 --> 13:31.378
"Femme feud, girl fight.

13:31.411 --> 13:32.612
Who wore it better?"

13:32.645 --> 13:34.214
It's like,
"Who wore it equally?"

13:34.247 --> 13:35.215
God, you're boring.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.483
Look, I get what you're doing

13:36.516 --> 13:38.618
with this girl
and I totally approve!

13:38.651 --> 13:41.454
You befriend the enemy and you
get more face time with Josh.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.223
If you really
neutralize her,

13:43.256 --> 13:45.092
maybe she'll give you some
solo time with him, so...

13:45.125 --> 13:46.226
No, no, mm-mm, no.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.360
That's not what I'm doing.

13:47.394 --> 13:48.495
That's not what
I'm doing at all.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.563
I know, that is not
what you're doing

13:50.597 --> 13:52.599
at all-- wink.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.135
No, I... (chuckles)
I really want to be her friend.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.569
Like, genuinely
want to be her friend.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.438
Wink.
Stop winking!

13:58.471 --> 14:00.207
(giggles)

14:00.240 --> 14:03.076
Ooh. Oh, she's teaching
a yoga class today at 3:00.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.377
Oh, that's, like, now!

14:04.411 --> 14:05.445
Change of plans.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.114
Eat the donut for me.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.481
I'm gonna go.
While I'm gone,

14:08.515 --> 14:10.918
pull up the Mendez file,
and see what previous motions

14:10.951 --> 14:13.020
the plaintiff has put
before the judge, okay?

14:13.053 --> 14:14.121
Yeah...
I love this!

14:14.154 --> 14:16.156
Gonna use it
on my car right now.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.157
Okay...

14:17.190 --> 14:20.060
Go get her!

14:21.694 --> 14:23.897
I'll be right here.

14:28.435 --> 14:31.671
And just breathe.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.041
Good.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.476
Everyone, thank you
for joining me today

14:36.509 --> 14:39.612
in a journey of self-discovery
and reflection.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.182
Oh, you came.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.450
How nice.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.085
Everyone, we have
some new faces today.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.920
Welcome.
Namaste.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.155
Namaste.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.157
Can I get an "ohm"?

14:50.190 --> 14:51.158
(laughs)

14:51.191 --> 14:52.559
Okay.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.128
So, let's start
in a gentle stretch.

14:55.162 --> 14:57.064
Breathe in.
(deep inhale)

14:57.097 --> 15:00.033
And out.
(exhales)

15:00.067 --> 15:02.702
Good, now let's move into our
first Vinyasa flow.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.472
And breathe in.

15:05.505 --> 15:09.176
And exhale on an ah...

15:09.209 --> 15:10.944
Ah!

15:10.978 --> 15:12.445
ALL:
Ah...

15:12.479 --> 15:16.016
(mystical music playing)

15:16.049 --> 15:19.252
* We are in a yoga class

15:19.286 --> 15:24.157
* Now is the time to let
your mind go blank *

15:24.191 --> 15:27.060
* And focus instead
on how awesome *

15:27.094 --> 15:30.998
* The yoga teacher is

15:37.770 --> 15:41.108
* Look at me, look at me

15:41.141 --> 15:43.343
* I'm so good at yoga

15:43.376 --> 15:45.078
* Look at me, look at me

15:45.112 --> 15:48.181
* I'm so good at yoga

15:48.215 --> 15:50.350
* Exhale on another sigh

15:50.383 --> 15:52.652
* Rebecca sucks *

15:55.055 --> 15:56.523
* I do stuff with my body

15:56.556 --> 15:59.259
* That no human
should be able to do *

15:59.292 --> 16:01.361
* Like putting my face
behind my knees *

16:01.394 --> 16:03.763
* Turning my hand into a shoe

16:03.796 --> 16:05.732
* As the morning sun
kisses a lotus *

16:05.765 --> 16:08.401
* I kiss my own hoo-ha--
can you do that? *

16:08.435 --> 16:10.503
* Great each day "Namaste"

16:10.537 --> 16:12.272
* Screw... you

16:12.305 --> 16:14.374
* You're fat

16:14.407 --> 16:16.243
* Look at me, look at me

16:16.276 --> 16:19.012
* I'm so good at yoga

16:19.046 --> 16:20.647
* Look at me, look at me

16:20.680 --> 16:23.383
* I'm so good at yoga

16:23.416 --> 16:25.685
* Look at her, look at her *

16:28.255 --> 16:30.157
* Look at her, look at her *

16:30.190 --> 16:32.292
* I'm so much better than you

16:35.295 --> 16:36.463
If you want to just
stay in child's pose,

16:36.496 --> 16:37.564
it's totally fine.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.099
Nope, I'm an adult!

16:39.132 --> 16:41.168
* I'm not afraid
to get tattoos *

16:41.201 --> 16:44.271
* And they are all in Sanskrit
* Panther *

16:44.304 --> 16:46.306
* Butt stuff
doesn't hurt at all *

16:46.339 --> 16:48.308
* Most times I prefer it

16:48.341 --> 16:49.809
* That's what this tattoo says

16:49.842 --> 16:52.045
* Look at her,
 look at her *

16:52.079 --> 16:55.448
* I'm so good at yoga
* Look at her, look at her *

16:55.482 --> 16:58.651
* I orgasm instantly

16:58.685 --> 17:00.787
* Look at her, look at her *

17:00.820 --> 17:03.323
* I'm not afraid
of clowns and trains *

17:03.356 --> 17:05.492
Come on!
* Look at her, look at her *

17:05.525 --> 17:08.261
* My father didn't leave me

17:08.295 --> 17:10.430
* Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah,
nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah *

17:10.463 --> 17:12.665
* N-N-N-N-N-Nyah
* Boom! *

17:12.699 --> 17:14.701
* Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah,
nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah *

17:14.733 --> 17:18.271
* I'm so good at yoga

17:18.305 --> 17:21.208
* Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah,
nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah *

17:21.241 --> 17:22.675
* N-N-N-N-N-Nyah
* Boom! *

17:24.344 --> 17:26.779
REBECCA:
Wow!

17:26.813 --> 17:29.482
Um, that was, like, amazing.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.618
Yeah, you are really sweating.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.653
I think you really
cleared out some toxins.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.756
I can see those heavy metals
just pouring out of you.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.091
Heavy metals, yeah.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.826
Well, I do eat
a lot of auto parts.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.128
Huh?

17:41.161 --> 17:42.162
Nothing, it's stupid.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.263
I'm stupid.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.398
Hey, do you want to go grab,
like, a coffee with me

17:45.432 --> 17:46.699
or something?

17:46.733 --> 17:48.401
I only drink water.

17:48.435 --> 17:49.869
And I got to go do some cardio.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.172
It's hard to break a sweat
doing beginner's yoga.

17:52.205 --> 17:55.142
Of... yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.209
So, maybe another time.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.444
Well, no worries.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.578
'Cause I'm just gonna
keep coming back.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.113
Um, I bought a 20-pack
on my way in,

18:00.147 --> 18:01.881
so I'm kind of your sugar mama

18:01.914 --> 18:03.283
if you know
what I'm saying.

18:03.316 --> 18:04.151
(laughs)
Yeah, I wish.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.785
I only get to keep
50% of each class.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.221
But until I own my own studio,
I can't complain.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.223
Well, your own studio.
I mean, that's,

18:10.257 --> 18:11.624
that's a great idea.
Have you looked into stuff yet?

18:11.658 --> 18:13.293
Because I-I'm actually,
I'm a lawyer

18:13.326 --> 18:14.894
and real estate
is my specialty.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.496
And I could help you
find a cheap place,

18:16.529 --> 18:17.830
get a good deal on a lease.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.699
Why would you want to do that?

18:19.732 --> 18:22.635
Well, that's why I moved here--
to support a local community.

18:22.669 --> 18:25.738
And building small businesses
is an essential part of that.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.508
Wow, did you, like,
go to Harvard or something?

18:28.541 --> 18:31.378
Um, yeah, but I don't like
to talk about it,

18:31.411 --> 18:32.745
'cause people get weird.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.314
Your shirt says Harvard.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.716
That way I don't have
to talk about it.

18:36.749 --> 18:39.652
Hmm, wow.
That's... impressive.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.254
Hey! Oh, mmm!

18:41.288 --> 18:42.655
This just popped into my nogs.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.391
Why don't we get lunch
sometime this week,

18:44.424 --> 18:47.394
and I'll just, I'll go over
all the deets about leases

18:47.427 --> 18:49.529
and how it works.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.531
And I can buy you
a really nice water.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.533
Okay.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.402
I like boxed water.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.537
Great.

18:58.938 --> 19:01.274
PAULA:
So...

19:01.308 --> 19:04.411
have a nice lunch with Valerio.

19:04.444 --> 19:05.812
Who knows, maybe next time,

19:05.845 --> 19:07.814
you'll actually
have lunch with Josh.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.816
Uh, okay, again,
this is not because of Josh.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.185
(phone chimes)

19:12.219 --> 19:13.586
Who's that?

19:13.620 --> 19:15.622
Josh!

19:24.731 --> 19:26.433
JOSH:
Hey!

19:26.466 --> 19:27.700
Hi!

19:27.734 --> 19:28.835
Sorry.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.437
Hi, um, so you
wanted to see me?

19:30.470 --> 19:32.539
Oh, before we go talk,
do you want some boba?

19:32.572 --> 19:33.606
It actually horrifies
me personally.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.408
It's like drinking
little tumors.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.444
But if you want some,
like, knock yourself out.

19:37.477 --> 19:38.645
No, I'm good, I'm good.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.413
So, listen, uh,
I've been scratching my head

19:40.447 --> 19:42.582
a little bit here,
'cause I heard

19:42.615 --> 19:46.419
you were having lunch
with Valencia?

19:46.453 --> 19:48.888
And I thought you were
gonna keep a little distance?

19:48.921 --> 19:50.690
Yeah, um, the friendship thing.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.592
I know that we talked
about that.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.728
But it just kind of,
it happened organically.

19:55.762 --> 19:56.729
You know?

19:56.763 --> 19:57.830
I won't say a word about camp.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.031
Oh, my God, like,

19:59.065 --> 20:01.468
I don't even factor that whole
thing into our friendship.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.836
I honestly,
I barely remember it.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.605
I mean, I've had many
sexual partners since.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.374
Clean as a whistle, though.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.608
I don't know.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.310
Uh, uh, she can get mad.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.644
She can, you know,

20:11.678 --> 20:14.347
get really mad.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.682
But what's there
to be mad about?

20:15.715 --> 20:17.750
Because if we're just
gonna be buds, that's all.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.886
And the great thing is,
if we're friends,

20:19.919 --> 20:22.622
then we can all hang out
and it won't be awkward.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.891
Right? We could
have lunches

20:24.924 --> 20:26.759
and dinners
and go to Spiders.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.895
Find out if it's
possessive or plural.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.763
(laughs)
Right?

20:32.599 --> 20:35.335
Thank you for letting me order
off the children's menu.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.770
You're so nice.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.540
This looks so good.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.841
So I really think
we're gonna

20:41.874 --> 20:43.042
get the property
on East Cameron.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.377
You think so?

20:44.411 --> 20:45.778
It would be so perfect.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.614
The square footage
is exactly what I need.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.048
But it was so expensive.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.917
And you low-balled the guy.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.785
No, no.
By the end of lunch,

20:52.819 --> 20:54.454
that guy's gonna call and cave.

20:54.487 --> 20:55.455
So, um,

20:55.488 --> 20:57.657
go back to what you were
saying about your diet,

20:57.690 --> 20:59.326
'cause it was,
it was fascinating.
Oh, yeah.

20:59.359 --> 21:02.395
So, I sent my wellness
coach a drop of my blood,

21:02.429 --> 21:04.764
and she told me which foods
go best with my blood type.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.699
So it's lots and
lots of greens

21:06.733 --> 21:08.435
and lean proteins
and no legumes.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.404
REBECCA:
 No legumes, no starches.

21:11.438 --> 21:12.939
God, she's so skinny.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.941
No wonder Josh loves her.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.676
You know, I-I sent
a drop of blood

21:16.709 --> 21:18.411
to a wellness coach one time,

21:18.445 --> 21:21.381
and they said that my blood type
works best with Panda Express.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.750
Really?
No. No, it doesn't.

21:23.783 --> 21:24.884
Oh, you were making a joke.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.419
Yeah, yeah.
Oh.

21:26.453 --> 21:27.954
Yeah, I think you
did that once before.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.789
Sorry, I don't like humor.

21:29.822 --> 21:30.923
Okay.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.393
Um, I've been
meaning to ask you.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.395
What kind of face
moisturizer do you use?

21:35.428 --> 21:37.864
'Cause my face has been dry
for, like, 20 years.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.532
Unrefined coconut oil.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.067
Really?
Yeah, mm-hmm.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.536
So, anyway, something else
my wellness coach said was--

21:43.570 --> 21:45.638
actually don't do the oil
pulling for 20 minutes...

21:45.672 --> 21:48.408
REBECCA:
 Coconut oil.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.010
Long necklace nestled
 in cleavage.

21:51.043 --> 21:53.546
Silky romper-- how do you
 pee in that thing?

21:53.580 --> 21:55.081
(cell phone chimes)
Hold on.

21:55.114 --> 21:57.584
Hold that very
important thought.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.621
We got your yoga studio.

22:01.654 --> 22:02.889
We did?
Yeah.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.791
Oh, my God, you're amazing.

22:04.824 --> 22:05.792
Oh.
Oh, my God.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.794
Hey, you're amazing.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.996
You smell like roasted corn.
Huh?

22:10.029 --> 22:11.998
I said you smell
like roasted corn.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.566
Oh, thanks.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.967
God, I can't
believe you did it.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.436
Well, I went to Harvard.

22:16.469 --> 22:17.970
I don't mess around.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.607
Do all people who go to Harvard
say it as much as you do?

22:20.640 --> 22:22.842
Yeah.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.618
You've checked your phone,
like, 80 times.

22:31.651 --> 22:32.885
Why are you so worried

22:32.919 --> 22:34.554
about Valencia having
lunch with Rebecca?

22:34.587 --> 22:38.024
Don't know, it just...
feels weird.

22:38.057 --> 22:40.159
Why? Did you and Rebecca
hook up or something?

22:40.192 --> 22:42.895
(scoffing): Um, no, bro,
I was eight years old.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.631
Even I am not
that big of a stud.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.399
Hmm.
Wait, why?

22:48.501 --> 22:50.503
Are you into Rebecca?

22:50.537 --> 22:51.504
Well...

22:51.538 --> 22:52.572
Is that why you're asking me?

22:52.605 --> 22:55.174
Uh, I'm not...
 not interested.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.175
Whoa.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.645
Wow, Serrano, coming from you,

22:58.678 --> 23:00.880
that is like...
a declaration of love.

23:00.913 --> 23:01.881
(scoffs)

23:01.914 --> 23:03.650
Dude, if you want her,
go for it.

23:03.683 --> 23:06.052
Maybe I will.
(grunts)

23:06.085 --> 23:09.121
Maybe I will throw my saddle

23:09.155 --> 23:10.790
on that filly.
Yeah.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.792
Take her for a ride
around the paddock.

23:12.825 --> 23:13.926
Yeah.

23:13.960 --> 23:14.927
Oh, yeah, you're gonna
ride that filly.

23:14.961 --> 23:16.796
(neighs)
(neighs)

23:16.829 --> 23:18.798
(grunts)

23:18.831 --> 23:20.733
Men are disgusting.

23:20.767 --> 23:23.135
Yeah.

23:23.169 --> 23:25.872
Hey, don't worry about
Valencia and Rebecca.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.607
They are not gonna
become friends.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.076
You know how Valencia
is with other women.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.811
Come on, she's not a bonder.

23:31.844 --> 23:32.979
She can't bond.

23:33.012 --> 23:34.581
(both laughing)

23:34.614 --> 23:36.816
I love you.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.851
No, I love you.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.587
(laughs)

23:40.620 --> 23:42.622
(chuckles)

23:47.594 --> 23:49.496
Hey, what's-what's wrong?

23:51.531 --> 23:53.032
Uh, it's just, you
wouldn't get this about me

23:53.065 --> 23:55.034
because of my wide
student fan base,

23:55.067 --> 23:58.004
but I actually don't have
a lot of girlfriends.

23:58.037 --> 24:00.106
Huh.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.108
The last time I had a solid
crew was in high school,

24:02.141 --> 24:03.576
but then they all got jealous

24:03.610 --> 24:04.977
because I got these
amazing boobs

24:05.011 --> 24:06.045
and they were still trolls,

24:06.078 --> 24:08.648
and so they spread all
these rumors that I, like,

24:08.681 --> 24:09.782
slept with the
English teacher.

24:09.816 --> 24:10.850
No.
I know.

24:10.883 --> 24:11.651
Which is a total lie,

24:11.684 --> 24:13.219
because we only
did hand stuff.

24:13.252 --> 24:14.621
And then everyone
turned on me,

24:14.654 --> 24:17.156
and since then, I just...

24:17.189 --> 24:19.225
I don't get along that
well with other girls.

24:19.258 --> 24:20.960
Oh, my God,
I'm the exact same way.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.895
Yeah?
I mean, except for the
English teacher part.

24:22.929 --> 24:25.064
That's-that's really cool.
Thanks.

24:25.097 --> 24:27.066
Although, um,
it-it's really cool,

24:27.099 --> 24:29.068
but, like, you know,
you should have reported that.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.970
Did you report it
to the appropriate authorities?

24:31.003 --> 24:33.573
Nah, it's just hand stuff--
it's not a big deal.

24:33.606 --> 24:36.843
Well, I mean, depending
on what age you were,

24:36.876 --> 24:39.211
it's technically a little
bit of statutory rape.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.647
Eh...
But, you know.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.649
I'll allow it.

24:42.682 --> 24:44.183
But seriously, a judge
would not have allowed it.

24:44.216 --> 24:45.184
He should be in jail.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.686
Do you know if he went to jail?

24:46.719 --> 24:47.954
Did he do it to other kids?

24:47.987 --> 24:50.156
Oh, my God, you're
amazing, you're so nice.

24:50.189 --> 24:53.159
I thought you just only wanted
to do real estate stuff with me,

24:53.192 --> 24:56.162
but we're friends.

24:56.195 --> 24:57.664
We're friends, right?

24:57.697 --> 24:59.932
Yeah. Yeah, we're...
we're fr...

24:59.966 --> 25:01.133
Yeah, we're friends...

25:01.167 --> 25:02.702
Yeah, we're friends.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.771
Yeah, 'cause, I mean, like,

25:04.804 --> 25:07.039
what other agenda
could I possibly have?

25:07.073 --> 25:08.908
(both laugh)

25:08.941 --> 25:10.943
That is such a weird
thing to say.

25:10.977 --> 25:11.944
(laughing):
I know!

25:11.978 --> 25:13.212
Aah!
Yeah.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.247
(both laugh, sigh)

25:19.351 --> 25:21.053
Mmm, your tushy's warm.

25:21.087 --> 25:21.788
Thanks.

25:26.158 --> 25:27.760
REBECCA (sighs happily):
 Yeah.

25:27.794 --> 25:30.296
Valencia and I are
basically the same person.

25:30.329 --> 25:33.032
Oh, she's like
me, except for...

25:33.065 --> 25:35.034
I don't know what
she is-- Guatemalan?

25:35.067 --> 25:36.769
I don't know, don't
quote me on that.

25:36.803 --> 25:39.772
Anyway, between us, it's
like we're Siamese souls.

25:39.806 --> 25:42.775
Excuse me,
just one second.

25:42.809 --> 25:44.811
(imitates vomiting)

25:46.212 --> 25:49.181
Now, uh, in case you missed it,
that was me vomiting.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.851
No, I got it.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.119
What's wrong with you?

25:53.152 --> 25:55.755
'Cause, like, I've made
a really cool friend.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.757
She's, like,
pretty and nice,

25:57.790 --> 25:59.759
and she knows about, like,
a lot of cool things,

25:59.792 --> 26:02.762
like coconut oil and movies
and Vampire Weekends.

26:02.795 --> 26:03.896
Like, what's your deal?

26:03.930 --> 26:07.767
We had a plan-- uh, neutralize
the enemy, not snuggle it.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.035
No, we didn't have a plan.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.203
You had a plan, I'm
making a friend.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.605
What?!
Wow.

26:12.639 --> 26:13.740
Are you jealous?

26:13.773 --> 26:16.275
(scoffs)
I am not jealous.

26:16.308 --> 26:19.278
I'm not saying this for me,
I'm saying this for you,

26:19.311 --> 26:22.014
you munchkin dumb-ass.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.049
This is unhealthy.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.784
Okay, all right.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.786
You need to take some
Motrin or something.

26:26.819 --> 26:29.055
Oh, you know, I have never
met anyone in my life

26:29.088 --> 26:30.757
who lies to themselves
as much as you do.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.024
You lie about
why you came here,

26:32.058 --> 26:33.225
You lie about how
you feel about Josh.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.895
You lie about why you want to
become friends with Valencia.

26:35.928 --> 26:38.164
Okay, okay, that's
enough! God!

26:38.197 --> 26:39.899
Let's just do this
stupid meeting

26:39.932 --> 26:41.400
with these stupid clients.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.903
Hello, gentlemen.

26:45.171 --> 26:48.040
So we heard most of that.

26:48.074 --> 26:50.910
I'm realizing that now
as I see the horrified looks

26:50.943 --> 26:52.645
on your faces.

26:52.679 --> 26:53.846
I'm so sorry.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.682
Paula and I were just having
a little disagreement out there.

26:55.715 --> 26:56.683
It has nothing to do with you.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.217
It will not
happen again.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.418
Let's get down
to business,

26:59.451 --> 27:00.552
shall we?

27:00.586 --> 27:02.154
You know that was very
inappropriate what we overheard.

27:02.188 --> 27:03.155
(cell phone chimes)
I understand.

27:03.189 --> 27:05.024
One sec...

27:05.057 --> 27:06.726
(whoops)
Going to Spiders.

27:06.759 --> 27:09.095
Which seems to be
possessive plural.

27:10.196 --> 27:10.997
Oh.
REBECCA:
Oh, I'm sorry.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.765
Did I mention that
I got Robertson

27:12.799 --> 27:14.133
to agree to an
arbitration next week?

27:15.401 --> 27:16.435
I didn't mention that.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.237
Should have led
with that. Sorry.

27:18.270 --> 27:19.706
How did you do that?

27:19.739 --> 27:21.440
Uh, we've been trying
to do that for years.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.910
Actually, I threatened
a lawsuit on the grounds

27:23.943 --> 27:25.444
that they were impeding
commercial development,

27:25.477 --> 27:27.880
and that they would be liable
for interest or extra costs.

27:27.914 --> 27:29.982
(clicks tongue)
(chuckles)

27:30.016 --> 27:32.985
So, news flash-- next week,
you are going to a hearing

27:33.019 --> 27:34.721
that will allow you to--
most likely--

27:34.754 --> 27:37.790
build the $10 million complex
downtown you have always wanted

27:37.824 --> 27:39.058
in your little heart of hearts,

27:39.091 --> 27:42.061
and I am going
to a super cool nightclub.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.796
Oh, I got
to go get ready.

27:43.830 --> 27:46.332
I should buy jewelry,
I don't have jewelry.

27:46.365 --> 27:48.367
(dance music pulsates)

27:56.242 --> 27:58.244
*

28:16.028 --> 28:17.730
Uh, love your dress.

28:17.764 --> 28:20.232
Oh, um, you
too, bitches.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.500
Do you want to
take a selfie?

28:21.533 --> 28:22.735
Yeah.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.272
Okay, all right,
one, two, three.

28:26.305 --> 28:29.275
(phone rings)

28:33.279 --> 28:34.513
What?

28:34.546 --> 28:36.983
MAN:
Uh, Mom, I stabbed Tommy.

28:37.016 --> 28:38.250
Uh, kind of.

28:38.284 --> 28:40.519
Brendan, I told you
I had to work late.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.521
But, uh, he's sort of bleeding.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.024
Okay, you know what,
figure it out.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.898
*

28:53.900 --> 28:54.867
Yeah.

28:54.901 --> 28:56.135
(whoops)
(whoops)

28:56.168 --> 28:58.137
It's hugging
my throat.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.339
(laughs) Don't you
just love her, Joshy?

29:00.372 --> 29:01.808
Don't you just want to put her

29:01.841 --> 29:03.142
in a bowl with chocolate sauce
and eat her?

29:03.175 --> 29:05.111
(imitates noshing)

29:05.144 --> 29:08.314
Uh, uh, I thought we were
off sugar, Valencia.

29:08.347 --> 29:09.315
Oh, you're funny.

29:09.348 --> 29:11.050
I'm starting to like humor.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.318
Come on,
dance with me, Joshy.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.253
I want to see you
work that thang.

29:19.926 --> 29:22.428
What's up with your
resting Maggie Smith face?

29:22.461 --> 29:23.830
What?

29:23.863 --> 29:25.031
What is this?

29:25.064 --> 29:27.299
This? This is called
a metallic mini.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.902
No, the thing where you
copy another girl's outfit.

29:29.936 --> 29:32.171
What are you up to,
you duplicitous minx?

29:32.204 --> 29:34.140
I'm not copying her.

29:34.173 --> 29:36.142
I'm just heavily
influenced by her,

29:36.175 --> 29:39.411
like... like how Picasso was
influenced by early portraiture

29:39.445 --> 29:41.380
before he created
the Cubist movement.

29:41.413 --> 29:43.515
You went to Harvard--
we get it.

29:43.549 --> 29:46.385
Anyway, can I
get you a drink?

29:46.418 --> 29:47.286
Um...

29:47.319 --> 29:49.488
How many bras are you
wearing, by the way?

29:49.521 --> 29:51.223
(sighs) Come on,
you crazy kids, let's dance.

29:51.257 --> 29:53.459
Okay.
Come on.

29:53.492 --> 29:54.460
Okay.
(whoops)

29:54.493 --> 29:56.963
Whoa, you
clean up good.

29:56.996 --> 29:58.064
Oh, thanks.

29:58.097 --> 30:00.166
I'm just gonna go dance
with my friend, though, so...

30:00.199 --> 30:01.901
Hey, whatever happened
with you and your ex?

30:01.934 --> 30:02.701
Uh, I saw him over there.

30:02.734 --> 30:04.336
It's the buff
Asian dude, right?

30:04.370 --> 30:05.838
Ex?

30:05.872 --> 30:07.106
No, he's not my ex.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.408
I... I was just talk...
I was just talking...

30:09.441 --> 30:11.277
Oh, you're still bummed
he's with that other girl.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.278
Don't worry.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.213
You'll get him, kid.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.949
Hey, I'll see you
at the market.

30:16.983 --> 30:19.218
Oh, next week we're having
a sale on clementines.

30:19.251 --> 30:20.987
It's gonna be tight!

30:23.489 --> 30:24.456
Wait a second.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.392
You and Josh dated?

30:26.425 --> 30:28.260
Okay, so nobody knows.

30:28.294 --> 30:29.896
Well, that guy knows.

30:29.929 --> 30:32.598
(scoffs)
I am so stupid.

30:32.631 --> 30:35.067
It all makes sense now--
everything, all of it.

30:35.101 --> 30:37.503
When did you date?
In New York?
It's complicated.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.906
(scoffs) No, something
with you is complicated?

30:39.939 --> 30:40.873
VALENCIA: Rebecca!
Oh, my God.

30:40.907 --> 30:41.908
Just please... just please
don't say anything.

30:41.941 --> 30:44.310
Please, please, please,
please don't say anything.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.344
Please, please,
please, please.

30:52.284 --> 30:53.519
Why so serious?

30:53.552 --> 30:55.254
Come on, dance with Greg.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.023
Dance with Greg.

30:59.025 --> 30:59.791
Get away from me.

30:59.825 --> 31:01.260
She-she wants me
to dance with you.

31:01.293 --> 31:02.528
You do everything
she says?

31:02.561 --> 31:04.030
No.

31:13.472 --> 31:15.474
(giggling):
Hi.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.314
Ooh, oh.

31:28.654 --> 31:32.658
(whooping)

31:39.665 --> 31:43.369
* Hey, cutie,
don't know if you knew *

31:43.402 --> 31:46.705
* But I've kind of got
a girl crush on you *

31:46.738 --> 31:50.442
* You're everything
that I wish I could be *

31:50.476 --> 31:54.046
* Gonna tell you what I want
to do to you, tee hee hee *

31:54.080 --> 31:57.649
* I want to lock you in a
basement with soundproof walls *

31:57.683 --> 32:01.387
* And take over your identity

32:01.420 --> 32:05.324
* I want to cut the silky hair
right off your head *

32:05.357 --> 32:08.594
* And slurp it up
like spaghetti *

32:08.627 --> 32:10.496
* Want to clone you
and consume you *

32:10.529 --> 32:12.398
* Want to own you
and cartoon you *

32:12.431 --> 32:15.267
* Fly your dirty panties
like a kite *

32:15.301 --> 32:16.102
* Kite

32:16.135 --> 32:18.104
* 'Cause I-I-I-I

32:18.137 --> 32:21.673
* I'm feeling kind of
naughty tonight *

32:21.707 --> 32:25.244
* Sorry I said
that creepy stuff out loud *

32:25.277 --> 32:28.714
* That was super rando

32:28.747 --> 32:32.051
* I meant to say I want
to do cutesy stuff *

32:32.084 --> 32:36.188
* Like pillow fight
or go swimming commando *

32:36.222 --> 32:39.125
* I want to kill you and wear
your skin like a dress *

32:39.158 --> 32:43.362
* But then also have you see me
in the dress *

32:43.395 --> 32:46.198
* And be like, "O-M-G,
you look so cute in my skin" *

32:46.232 --> 32:48.367
* I want to lock you
in a basement *

32:48.400 --> 32:52.771
* But in that basement you would
also be my personal trainer *

32:52.804 --> 32:54.473
* I want your abs

32:54.506 --> 32:57.443
* Break into your mom's house,
collect your baby teeth *

32:57.476 --> 33:00.412
* And turn them into
my new retainer *

33:00.446 --> 33:02.014
* I want your smile

33:02.048 --> 33:03.649
* Cook your spit
into a chowder *

33:03.682 --> 33:05.584
* Dry your sweat into a powder

33:05.617 --> 33:08.420
* And do lines of you
all through the night *

33:08.454 --> 33:09.421
* Night

33:09.455 --> 33:13.059
* 'Cause I-I-I-I-I-I-I

33:13.092 --> 33:14.593
* I'm feeling kind of naughty

33:14.626 --> 33:16.462
* Take measurements
of your body *

33:16.495 --> 33:18.297
* Then go up to a surgeon

33:18.330 --> 33:20.066
* Make my body like your body

33:20.099 --> 33:22.168
* Like that film with Liberace

33:22.201 --> 33:25.471
* 'Cause I'm feeling
kind of naughty tonight. *

33:25.504 --> 33:27.706
(both laughing)

33:29.508 --> 33:31.143
Wait, wait.

33:37.516 --> 33:38.650
Oh!

33:38.684 --> 33:39.751
Are you crazy?!

33:39.785 --> 33:41.187
What is wrong with you?!

33:41.220 --> 33:42.488
We were just being cute!

33:42.521 --> 33:43.489
Cute kissing.

33:43.522 --> 33:44.723
For attention.

33:44.756 --> 33:47.193
(groans)
Are you stupid, Harvard?

33:47.226 --> 33:49.195
Oh, this is why I can't
be friends with women!

33:49.228 --> 33:51.430
Why does everyone want
to have sex with me?!

33:51.463 --> 33:53.432
Okay, so, Valencia, Valencia?

33:53.465 --> 33:55.101
It's all good, okay?

33:55.134 --> 33:57.203
It's just, it's just
there's so much love here.

33:57.236 --> 33:58.370
Just back off, okay?

33:58.404 --> 33:59.738
I-I think we should
call it a night.

33:59.771 --> 34:01.340
You think?
Hey, shh, come on.

34:01.373 --> 34:02.674
No, I-I just want to apologize!
I want to talk to you...

34:02.708 --> 34:04.743
The reason why,
the reason with her-- Valencia?

34:04.776 --> 34:06.178
See, okay, it
all makes sense,

34:06.212 --> 34:07.379
because it's a circle of love.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.148
Because I love you.

34:09.181 --> 34:10.081
You love Josh.

34:10.116 --> 34:12.384
And Josh and I used
to love each other.

34:12.418 --> 34:14.420
(groans)

34:18.690 --> 34:20.726
What is this drunk bitch
talking about?

34:20.759 --> 34:22.393
REBECCA:
Um...

34:22.428 --> 34:24.429
so I'd like to start by saying

34:24.463 --> 34:26.431
that it was nothing.

34:26.465 --> 34:28.600
What... is... she...

34:28.634 --> 34:31.603
talking about?!

34:31.637 --> 34:33.605
Um...

34:33.639 --> 34:35.440
um...

34:35.474 --> 34:38.777
Do you remember that summer
between 11th and 12th grade

34:38.810 --> 34:41.813
when, uh, I went to camp...

34:41.847 --> 34:44.382
and we were
technically on a break?

34:44.416 --> 34:46.217
It was, it was eons ago!
Right? It was eons ago!

34:46.252 --> 34:47.553
It meant nothing!

34:47.585 --> 34:49.420
It was just two young bucks

34:49.455 --> 34:52.123
sharing two months
of summer love.

34:52.158 --> 34:53.625
It was a moment of connection.

34:53.659 --> 34:57.429
And isn't that
what yoga's all about?

34:57.463 --> 35:00.199
Why did you lie to me?

35:00.232 --> 35:02.734
B-Because he...

35:02.768 --> 35:05.171
I-I was afraid.
I was afraid.

35:05.204 --> 35:06.672
I was afraid, okay?!

35:06.705 --> 35:08.440
I was afraid.

35:08.474 --> 35:09.841
I don't know
what you're trying to do

35:09.875 --> 35:12.711
or why you pretended
to be my friend,

35:12.744 --> 35:14.313
but stay away from me

35:14.346 --> 35:17.216
and my Josh.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.393
Are you okay?

35:29.295 --> 35:30.729
No.

35:30.762 --> 35:32.731
Let me go out on a limb and say

35:32.764 --> 35:34.466
telling the truth
from the beginning

35:34.500 --> 35:36.602
probably would've been
the better option here?

35:36.635 --> 35:38.637
You're right.

35:38.670 --> 35:39.738
(chuckles)

35:39.771 --> 35:42.208
I messed everything up.

35:43.909 --> 35:46.212
Thank you for pointing it out.

35:46.245 --> 35:48.347
Is this what you wanted?

35:48.380 --> 35:50.549
You're right.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.551
I'm hungry.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.520
You want to go to a diner?

35:54.553 --> 35:56.288
Maybe get a cup of coffee?

35:56.322 --> 35:58.490
You could use a cup of coffee,
some flapjacks.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.226
Just... I...

36:00.259 --> 36:02.261
Stop being nice to me, okay?

36:02.928 --> 36:05.731
Great to see you, Mr. Spiders!

36:05.764 --> 36:07.766
Well, at least
that's been cleared up.

36:13.004 --> 36:16.208
(humming "We Wish
You a Merry Christmas")

36:17.909 --> 36:20.212
It's not Christmas!

36:20.246 --> 36:21.980
Well, I just like the song.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.114
Where's Rebecca?

36:23.148 --> 36:25.784
I usually see you two at break
enjoying your Luna Bars.

36:25.817 --> 36:27.686
Who cares?
I don't care about her.

36:27.719 --> 36:29.455
She talks too much.

36:29.488 --> 36:30.789
Well, I don't know about that.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.224
But she does always
eat the Lemon Zest bars,

36:32.258 --> 36:34.793
before I can get my mitts
on them, mmm.

36:34.826 --> 36:37.863
You know Luna Bars
are for women, right?

36:37.896 --> 36:40.666
Oh, I did not.

36:40.699 --> 36:44.403
Yeah, I think they have,
like, menstrual blood in them.

36:44.436 --> 36:45.704
Stop that.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.973
No, they don't.

36:48.006 --> 36:49.975
Oof!

36:51.377 --> 36:53.412
It's a long story.

36:53.445 --> 36:56.682
Can I get the number
for Luna Bars customer service?

36:56.715 --> 36:58.584
I feel like I've lost her.

36:59.985 --> 37:01.420
I know I still have you.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.822
But you have
your rugby friends now.

37:06.325 --> 37:07.959
What should I do?

37:14.065 --> 37:16.502
Hey.

37:16.535 --> 37:18.937
Hey.

37:20.472 --> 37:21.740
Oh!

37:21.773 --> 37:24.543
Munchkin.

37:24.576 --> 37:27.446
God, I am so sorry.

37:27.479 --> 37:30.649
I'm such a bad friend.

37:30.682 --> 37:33.485
You're the only person
that I can trust.

37:33.519 --> 37:35.554
You know why?
You're a true friend.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.956
Because a true friend
is somebody who loves you

37:37.989 --> 37:39.558
no matter what.

37:39.591 --> 37:42.294
Even if your Downward Dog
is horrible.

37:42.328 --> 37:44.896
(laughing):
Oh, come here.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.565
Oh, you guys.

37:46.598 --> 37:49.435
Ow, not you, Darryl!
Get off!

37:49.468 --> 37:51.770
You know, that's not true
about Luna Bars.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.772
Talked to the customer service.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.807
They were very nice.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.883
So, my client, Mr. Mendez,
will drop his countersuit

38:04.916 --> 38:08.854
and will reimburse Mr. Robertson
for all of his relocation fees

38:08.887 --> 38:11.457
for the entire
duration of construction.

38:11.490 --> 38:14.025
Also, he will provide
a free lease

38:14.059 --> 38:15.494
on a floor-through space

38:15.527 --> 38:18.497
for a period of 18 months.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.366
Hmm, Ms. Bunch,

38:20.399 --> 38:22.768
your arguments are...

38:22.801 --> 38:24.636
persuasive.

38:27.406 --> 38:28.774
I rule in your favor,
Mr. Mendez.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.409
You are free to build
on that lot,

38:30.442 --> 38:32.878
pending the usual approvals
and inspections.

38:32.911 --> 38:34.380
(laughing)

38:34.413 --> 38:35.981
Thank you.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.649
Ah!

38:37.683 --> 38:40.752
I have been trying to settle
this case for ten years.

38:40.786 --> 38:42.688
Uh, yeah, I think you mentioned
that once or twice.

38:42.721 --> 38:45.657
This is what she did for you her
first week of working for you.

38:45.691 --> 38:47.526
Imagine what she's
gonna do next week.

38:47.559 --> 38:49.094
Yes! Yes!

38:49.127 --> 38:50.662
Yes! Let's go.

38:50.696 --> 38:52.531
Go drink, gentlemen.
Yes! Ha-ha!

38:52.564 --> 38:53.632
Thank you, thank you.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.801
You're welcome.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.035
(both shriek)

38:57.068 --> 38:59.438
Oh, my God!

38:59.471 --> 39:01.072
Well done!
Bang! Bang! Bang!

39:01.106 --> 39:02.408
Oh! Oh, guess what.

39:02.441 --> 39:03.942
What?
I got something for you.

39:03.975 --> 39:05.377
Oh, Paula, another present?

39:05.411 --> 39:06.545
Come on, you don't
have to do that.

39:06.578 --> 39:08.580
(stammers)
Don't move.

39:10.549 --> 39:13.485
I got these...

39:14.820 --> 39:16.622
(both laughing)

39:16.655 --> 39:19.157
...for your feud with Valencia.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.026
So, you know,

39:21.059 --> 39:24.095
if it ever becomes a feud again,

39:24.129 --> 39:27.899
we'll have these handy.

39:27.933 --> 39:29.401
(laughs)

39:29.435 --> 39:31.537
Paula, that's really sweet.

39:31.570 --> 39:32.604
Thank you.

39:32.638 --> 39:35.106
I just want you to know
that if you ever need it,

39:35.140 --> 39:39.878
this... T-shirt will
always be there for you.

39:39.911 --> 39:41.980
I know, thank you.

39:42.013 --> 39:43.114
Okay.

39:43.148 --> 39:44.516
And I'm here.

39:44.550 --> 39:46.518
The-the T-shirt is me.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.554
Which you got that.
Yeah, I get it.

39:48.587 --> 39:49.788
I don't know why

39:49.821 --> 39:52.624
I felt the need
to explain that to...

39:56.061 --> 39:57.763
Hi, excuse me.

39:57.796 --> 39:59.731
Um, I'm here
to see Rebecca Bunch.

39:59.765 --> 40:00.966
Is she here?

40:05.937 --> 40:07.773
Hi.

40:07.806 --> 40:09.174
Hi, do you have a second?

40:09.207 --> 40:11.510
Uh, yeah, I have a second.

40:11.543 --> 40:13.879
I have two seconds.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.515
How many... (laughs)
seconds do you need?

40:16.548 --> 40:17.849
Let's take all the seconds.

40:17.883 --> 40:19.017
Okay.
Let's go...

40:19.050 --> 40:20.151
This is my good luck room!

40:20.185 --> 40:21.887
Let's go
in my good luck room.

40:21.920 --> 40:22.854
You know why it's
my good luck room?

40:22.888 --> 40:24.890
I just actually won,
like, a big case in here.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.626
Like, literally seconds ago,
I won a huge case.
Wow.

40:27.659 --> 40:29.695
Yeah.
This place is sweet!

40:29.728 --> 40:30.862
Yeah, yeah, it's...

40:30.896 --> 40:32.130
Why are you here?
Why are...?

40:32.163 --> 40:34.232
Not, like, why are you here?
Why are you here?

40:34.265 --> 40:36.502
Uh, I've been thinking
about it a lot,

40:36.535 --> 40:39.004
and I realize...

40:39.037 --> 40:41.006
I shouldn't have
asked you to lie.

40:41.039 --> 40:43.975
The-the crazy stuff that
happened last night, it was

40:44.009 --> 40:46.244
all my fault in a way,
because of the lying.

40:46.277 --> 40:49.548
No, no.
Some of it was my fault, too.

40:49.581 --> 40:52.718
I mean, sticking my tongue down
your girlfriend's throat

40:52.751 --> 40:54.786
kind of crossed a line.

40:54.820 --> 40:56.154
Right?

40:56.187 --> 40:57.923
Well, anyway, uh,
I'd like to make it up to you.

40:57.956 --> 41:01.560
So I was thinking you want
to grab that dinner tonight?

41:01.593 --> 41:04.663
Um...

41:04.696 --> 41:06.264
yeah.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.867
That sounds great.

41:14.906 --> 41:17.609
Mmm, mmm!
So good.

41:17.643 --> 41:18.910
Right?
Mmm!

41:18.944 --> 41:20.278
This place is awesome.
I know.

41:20.311 --> 41:21.813
Do you come here a lot?

41:21.847 --> 41:23.549
Well, nah, it's a little far.

41:23.582 --> 41:26.552
I was gonna say I drove,
like, 45 minutes to get here.

41:26.585 --> 41:27.953
Yeah.

41:27.986 --> 41:31.056
Does Valencia know
we're hanging out tonight?

41:31.089 --> 41:32.591
Uh, no, she says
she doesn't want me

41:32.624 --> 41:33.925
to see you ever again.

41:33.959 --> 41:35.694
So this is
probably the last time

41:35.727 --> 41:37.228
we can have dinner.

41:37.262 --> 41:39.665
(laughs)
Well, we'll see about that.

41:39.698 --> 41:40.799
(laughing):
Yeah.

41:40.832 --> 41:42.834
We'll see about that.

41:48.006 --> 41:50.676
Welcome, everyone,

41:50.709 --> 41:52.878
to Vampire Weekend.

41:52.911 --> 41:55.013
For those of you who would
like to go waterskiing,

41:55.046 --> 41:56.748
there will be a tutorial

41:56.782 --> 42:00.552
at 2:00... a.m.

42:00.586 --> 42:02.554
You see?
