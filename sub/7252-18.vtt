00:14.431 --> 00:16.475
you're picking everything out?

00:16.517 --> 00:18.226
Well, they've ruined trail mix.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.226
They used to be simple.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.020
Now they put too much

00:20.061 --> 00:21.730
to expect with any given bite.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.357
Will it be fruity?

00:21.772 --> 00:23.357
Will it be granola-y?

00:23.398 --> 00:25.901
Will it be chocolate

- Soybean.

Ladies, please, we're saying

00:27.903 --> 00:30.739
goodbye to Mr. Twickham.

- So?

00:30.781 --> 00:32.533

00:38.622 --> 00:40.332

00:40.374 --> 00:42.584
I forget. When was the last

00:40.374 --> 00:42.584
time we thought he was dying?

00:42.626 --> 00:45.128
- It's been a good two years.

00:42.626 --> 00:45.128
- I remember now.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.631
- The last time, the rain.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.631
- We got drenched.

00:47.673 --> 00:49.675
It made the he's dying thing

00:47.673 --> 00:49.675
a total bummer.

00:49.717 --> 00:52.386
Ladies, please,

01:03.146 --> 01:04.815
Andrew?

01:04.857 --> 01:06.942
- A little tired.

01:04.857 --> 01:06.942
- Well, dying is exhausting.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.109
Yeah, he's thinking

01:06.984 --> 01:08.109
of taking a break

01:08.151 --> 01:09.528
and picking up

01:08.151 --> 01:09.528
again tomorrow.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.279

01:09.570 --> 01:11.279
- We've waited for an hour.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.365
He's kinda distracted anyway,

01:11.321 --> 01:13.365

01:13.407 --> 01:16.035
he was TiVoing

01:13.407 --> 01:16.035

01:16.076 --> 01:17.202
Do we have time

01:16.076 --> 01:17.202

Ugh, not really,

01:21.248 --> 01:23.500
"Goodbye, Mr. Twickham",

01:21.248 --> 01:23.500
and then vamoose.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.836
He should really start

01:23.542 --> 01:25.836

- Old man Twickham.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.994
who should interview you.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.705
Okay, Alisha Kensington,

06:09.036 --> 06:11.705
staff writer

06:11.746 --> 06:15.416
too green, and way too stiff.

06:11.746 --> 06:15.416
Too many adverbs.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.253
Frederick Fairmount,

06:15.458 --> 06:18.253
he talks more about himself

06:18.295 --> 06:19.587
than the person

06:18.295 --> 06:19.587
he's interviewing.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.215
Something boozy about him too.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.091
I don't think they let you pick

06:21.256 --> 06:23.091
who's gonna interview you.

06:23.133 --> 06:26.385
Well, just in case they offer.

06:23.133 --> 06:26.385
But this is big.

06:26.427 --> 06:29.514
Yeah, I guess it is. Ah!

06:26.427 --> 06:29.514
What happened there?

06:29.556 --> 06:31.725
Uh, what do you think? Taylor.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.434
How did Taylor break the window?

06:33.476 --> 06:35.187
How do you think?

06:33.476 --> 06:35.187
By being Taylor.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.105
Taylor's taylorness

06:35.229 --> 06:37.105
can now break glass?

06:37.147 --> 06:38.481
You know what I mean,

06:37.147 --> 06:38.481
he's doing something

06:38.523 --> 06:40.025
and crash, bang, there you go.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.569
- Hey, is it, uh, 6:00 yet?

06:40.067 --> 06:42.569
- A little past.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.696
Oh, shoot!

06:42.610 --> 06:44.696
Town meeting started.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.073
- So?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.073
- So, I thought we'd go.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.824
I mean, you like those things,

06:46.114 --> 06:47.824
right?

06:47.866 --> 06:49.450
- Uh, yeah, but you don't.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.450
- Alright, but, you know.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.661
This is your big night,

06:49.492 --> 06:51.661
you know, with the article

06:51.703 --> 06:53.496
and everything, look, why

06:51.703 --> 06:53.496
don't we hit the town meeting

06:53.538 --> 06:55.582
then we'll go get something to

06:53.538 --> 06:55.582
eat like a little celebration?

06:55.623 --> 06:57.292
- Oh, sounds good.

06:55.623 --> 06:57.292
- Yeah, great, alright.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.753
- We gotta, we gotta hurry.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.753
- Okay.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.797
Come on, people.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.797
It's not that complicated.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.841
- I don't wanna be a burden.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.841
- Uh, Patty.

07:04.883 --> 07:07.135
What about the couch you have

07:04.883 --> 07:07.135
in the back of the studio?

07:07.177 --> 07:10.597
In her freezing cold studio

07:07.177 --> 07:10.597
with no insulation and no heat.

07:10.638 --> 07:12.182
- 'Sounds great.'

07:10.638 --> 07:12.182
- Hi.

07:12.224 --> 07:14.851
- Hi, what's happening?

07:12.224 --> 07:14.851
- Problems with Kirk's schedule.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.354
Urgh! Can't Sheriff Taylor

07:14.893 --> 07:17.354
just let him

07:17.396 --> 07:18.772
share a cell with Otis

07:17.396 --> 07:18.772
for the night?

07:18.813 --> 07:21.233
Well, maybe the Morris'

07:18.813 --> 07:21.233
will take him again.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.277
Their kid stuck things

07:21.275 --> 07:23.277
in my nose.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.028
Well, then, lock the door

07:23.318 --> 07:25.028
when you sleep.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.613
It wasn't while I was asleep.

07:26.654 --> 07:29.324
- Hey, how'd you drag Luke here?

07:26.654 --> 07:29.324
- Ah, he wanted to come.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.743
I'll just sleep outside

07:29.366 --> 07:31.743
in the gazebo.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.704
I would ask though

07:31.785 --> 07:34.704
that if I die from exposure

07:34.746 --> 07:36.123
don't just dump me

07:34.746 --> 07:36.123
in the landfill.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.499
No one's dumping you

07:36.164 --> 07:38.499
in a landfill, Kirk.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.419
It's against regulations.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.046
Uh, let's pigeonhole this matter

07:40.460 --> 07:43.046
for now, people.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.340
Get on to our next order

07:43.088 --> 07:45.340
of business.

07:45.382 --> 07:48.343
It's the matter of the estate

07:45.382 --> 07:48.343
of the late Joshua Twickham.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.804
- You bring food?

07:48.385 --> 07:50.804
- After the trail mix fiasco?

07:50.845 --> 07:52.555
- I wouldn't dare.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.555
- Shh.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.975
Sorry.

07:55.016 --> 07:58.561
....that this beloved elder was

07:55.016 --> 07:58.561
generous even on his deathbed.

07:58.603 --> 08:03.317
Mr. Twickham has left

07:58.603 --> 08:03.317
his beautiful home to the town.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.319
Is his deathbed still there?

08:03.358 --> 08:05.319
I'm not picky.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.945
What does that mean?

08:05.360 --> 08:06.945
To the town?

08:06.987 --> 08:08.196
Luke, what are you doing here?

08:08.238 --> 08:10.240
Just keep going, Taylor.

08:10.282 --> 08:13.701
He left the house to the

08:10.282 --> 08:13.701
Stars Hollow Historical Society

08:13.743 --> 08:17.456
along with his ample collection

08:13.743 --> 08:17.456
of valuable memorabilia.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.458
His will stipulates

08:17.497 --> 08:19.458
that the house

08:19.499 --> 08:21.293
is to be converted

08:19.499 --> 08:21.293
into a museum.

08:21.335 --> 08:22.877
A museum?

08:22.919 --> 08:24.421
Are you going to interrupt me

08:22.919 --> 08:24.421
the whole meeting?

08:24.463 --> 08:26.173
I'm just asking.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.342
A Stars Hollow Museum.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.969
We will display his personal

08:28.383 --> 08:30.969
historical artifacts

08:31.011 --> 08:32.929
for a period of two months,

08:31.011 --> 08:32.929
after two months

08:32.971 --> 08:35.265
the house is to be disposed

08:32.971 --> 08:35.265
of at the discretion

08:35.307 --> 08:37.392
of the head

08:35.307 --> 08:37.392
of the Historical Society.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.353
- Meaning me.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.353
- Oh, goody.

08:39.394 --> 08:40.645
So now, you're gonna talk

08:39.394 --> 08:40.645
under your breath.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.314
- I'm sorry.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.314
- 'Funny.'

08:42.356 --> 08:43.815
I didn't hear those words

08:42.356 --> 08:43.815
come out of your mouth

08:43.857 --> 08:45.566
this morning

08:43.857 --> 08:45.566
after you tried to kill me.

08:45.608 --> 08:46.985
What?

08:47.027 --> 08:49.279
So we're going to need

08:47.027 --> 08:49.279
strong volunteers

08:49.321 --> 08:51.239
to make this dream a reality.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.074
Now, anyone with

08:51.281 --> 08:53.074
the appropriate skills

08:53.116 --> 08:54.617
let's see a show of hands.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.745
Uh, you really have

08:55.535 --> 08:57.745
to fill me in on the gag here.

08:57.787 --> 09:01.208
Luke, don't come to these things

08:57.787 --> 09:01.208
just to mock our business.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.335
I'm not mocking anything.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.335
I'm volunteering.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.337
After you threw a frying pan

09:03.377 --> 09:05.337
at my head.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.005
You threw a frying pan

09:05.379 --> 09:07.005
at Taylor's head?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.882
Just for playing

09:07.047 --> 09:08.882
my Muzak too loud.

09:08.923 --> 09:11.592
I mean,

09:08.923 --> 09:11.592
who doesn't love Muzak?

09:11.634 --> 09:13.220
Oh! Music lovers?

09:13.261 --> 09:15.555
The thing slipped out

09:13.261 --> 09:15.555
of my hand.

09:15.596 --> 09:18.308
Right after you said, quote,

09:15.596 --> 09:18.308
um, "You better duck, Taylor

09:18.350 --> 09:20.560
because I'm going to throw

09:18.350 --> 09:20.560
this frying pan at your head."

09:20.601 --> 09:22.812
You threw a frying pan at

09:20.601 --> 09:22.812
Taylor's head without me there?

09:22.854 --> 09:24.398
- I hate you.

09:22.854 --> 09:24.398
- I'm volunteering.

09:24.439 --> 09:25.690
Take it or leave it.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.067
Patty, take down the names

09:27.108 --> 09:29.403
of the legitimate volunteers,

09:27.108 --> 09:29.403
please.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.405
Now, whoever is actually

09:29.444 --> 09:31.405
going to show up

09:31.446 --> 09:33.532
our day will start

09:31.446 --> 09:33.532
at 7:00 sharp.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.867
To the rest, shame on you.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.495
'Now, on to item number three'

09:38.537 --> 09:40.830
'budgetary concerns

09:38.537 --> 09:40.830
about the new snowplow.'

09:40.872 --> 09:43.708
I'm sorry, does Taylor have

09:40.872 --> 09:43.708
compromising pictures of you?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.585
- Or something?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.585
- It's no joke.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.337
Why on earth are you

09:45.626 --> 09:47.337
volunteering for Taylor?

09:47.379 --> 09:50.382
- Well, um..

09:47.379 --> 09:50.382
- Luke?

09:50.424 --> 09:52.259
How well did you know

09:50.424 --> 09:52.259
old man Twickham?

09:52.300 --> 09:54.886
- Somewhat.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.886
- Well, I knew him all my life.

09:54.928 --> 09:58.265
He was like another dad

09:54.928 --> 09:58.265
in a way.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.391
Wow, nice.

09:59.433 --> 10:00.767
I didn't show up

09:59.433 --> 10:00.767
to say goodbye

10:00.808 --> 10:02.936
and I was feeling

10:00.808 --> 10:02.936
a little guilty about it.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.313
You know, he was a good guy.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.313
I just wanna do right by him.

10:05.355 --> 10:08.483
Well, you are a terrific fellow,

10:05.355 --> 10:08.483
Luke Danes.

10:08.525 --> 10:11.445
No, Kirk, if you build

10:08.525 --> 10:11.445
an igloo to sleep in

10:11.486 --> 10:13.821
and the town plow runs

10:11.486 --> 10:13.821
over it and kills you

10:13.863 --> 10:17.242
we are not going to just

10:13.863 --> 10:17.242
leave your corpse in the snow.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.411
Okay, but I don't wanna

10:17.284 --> 10:19.411
be a burden.

10:20.661 --> 10:23.206
Let's store all the boxes

10:20.661 --> 10:23.206
inside, sort through them

10:23.248 --> 10:25.708
in there, then store what

10:23.248 --> 10:25.708
we don't need in the garage.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.669
- Morning, Taylor.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.669
- What are you doing here?

10:28.711 --> 10:31.047
- I volunteered.

10:28.711 --> 10:31.047
- I don't get the joke.

10:31.089 --> 10:34.008
There's no joke.

10:31.089 --> 10:34.008
I'm at your disposal.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.802
Now, we're gonna need

10:34.050 --> 10:35.802
a nice, flat staging area.

10:35.843 --> 10:38.555
Perhaps over there, because

10:35.843 --> 10:38.555
there's no space here out front.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.974
- What about right here?

10:38.597 --> 10:40.974
- My office is going here.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.517
Your office?

10:41.015 --> 10:42.517
Why do you need an office?

10:42.559 --> 10:44.352
- So, you came to complain?

10:42.559 --> 10:44.352
- No, I was just..

10:44.394 --> 10:46.271
I'm organizing. I'm working.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.271
I need an office.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.189
Okay, fine.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.189
Sorry. Carry on.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.358
Uh, come on, everybody,

10:48.231 --> 10:50.358
let's hook up with people inside

10:50.400 --> 10:52.777
and I'll start

10:50.400 --> 10:52.777
handing out assignments.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.238
- Uh, where are you going?

10:52.819 --> 10:55.238
- Inside.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.616
- Why?

10:55.280 --> 10:57.616
- I'm a volunteer.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.498
- Hey, Luke.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.498
- Hey, Kyle.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.958
- Just thought I'd lend a hand.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.958
- Good one.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.043
- Is this everybody, people?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.043
- I believe so, Taylor.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.337
What the hell are you

11:09.085 --> 11:10.337
doing here?

11:10.378 --> 11:12.464
I can't keep

11:10.378 --> 11:12.464
answering this question.

11:12.506 --> 11:15.634
Come in, good folk.

11:15.674 --> 11:18.219
We are embarking

11:15.674 --> 11:18.219
on a wonderful adventure.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.888
Right here in this room,

11:18.261 --> 11:20.888
we'll display Mr. Twickham's

11:20.930 --> 11:23.224
impressive collection

11:20.930 --> 11:23.224
of memorabilia.

11:23.266 --> 11:26.561
Upstairs, we'll house

11:23.266 --> 11:26.561
the multimedia dioramas

11:26.603 --> 11:28.271
depicting the history

11:26.603 --> 11:28.271
of the town.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.648
Sounds good.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.316
Now, I took

11:29.730 --> 11:31.316
the liberty of doing up

11:31.358 --> 11:33.443
some fun shirts

11:31.358 --> 11:33.443
that we all can wear.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.903
Everyone, please,

11:33.485 --> 11:35.903
put one on.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.660
(Taylor)

11:39.866 --> 11:41.660
'Isn't that nice?'

11:41.700 --> 11:43.702
Uh, they all take

11:41.700 --> 11:43.702
a cold-water wash

11:43.744 --> 11:46.665
and tumble dry, low.

11:46.705 --> 11:49.708
Now, before we begin,

11:46.705 --> 11:49.708
I'd like us all to join hands.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.836
- What?

11:49.750 --> 11:51.836
- He's a twisted, little perv.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.380
- If you ask me.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.380
- Come on, everybody.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.839
Take hands.

11:56.841 --> 12:00.094
Let's close our eyes

11:56.841 --> 12:00.094
and visualize our goal.

12:00.136 --> 12:05.433
Picture a freckle-faced boy,

12:00.136 --> 12:05.433
eyes wide with curiosity

12:05.475 --> 12:08.353
drinking in the history of

12:05.475 --> 12:08.353
the town as he wanders the room.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.938
He's by the door.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.938
He's going by the stairs.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.107
- He's delighting--

12:10.980 --> 12:13.107
- Luke's peeking.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.984
That means you're peeking too,

12:13.149 --> 12:14.984
snitch.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.320
- Quiet, please.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.320
- Hey, I've lost track.

12:17.362 --> 12:18.988
Where's the freckle-faced kid

12:17.362 --> 12:18.988
walking?

12:19.030 --> 12:21.408
Okay, I think that's enough

12:19.030 --> 12:21.408
visualizing, everybody.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.868
How about we start organizing

12:21.449 --> 12:23.868
all these boxes, okay?

12:25.828 --> 12:27.830
I'd like a moment

12:25.828 --> 12:27.830
with you, Luke.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.332
Yeah, time to let go

12:27.872 --> 12:29.332
there, Taylor.

12:29.374 --> 12:30.791
I want the straight

12:29.374 --> 12:30.791
skinny from you.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.210
Really? Let go of my hand.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.878
Not until you tell me

12:32.252 --> 12:33.878
what you're doing.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.296
I'm really just trying

12:33.920 --> 12:35.296
to get my hand away from you.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.257
Why are you here?

12:35.338 --> 12:37.257
Why did you volunteer?

12:37.298 --> 12:38.425
Because I wanted to.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.301
Luke, you hated

12:38.466 --> 12:40.301
old man Twickham.

12:40.343 --> 12:41.678
I know that for a fact,

12:40.343 --> 12:41.678
you said

12:41.720 --> 12:44.264
despicable things

12:41.720 --> 12:44.264
about him your whole life.

12:44.305 --> 12:47.267
Well, okay. If you must know,

12:44.305 --> 12:47.267
Lorelai asked me.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.976
- Lorelai?

12:47.308 --> 12:48.976
- That's right.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.271
You know, we've been through

12:49.018 --> 12:51.271
a bit of a rough patch.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.481
Well, I wanna make things

12:51.312 --> 12:53.481
right with her.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.024
Get off to a good, new start.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.569
She really wants me to get

12:55.066 --> 12:57.569
involved in community things

12:57.611 --> 12:59.904
and she asked me to get involved

12:57.611 --> 12:59.904
so I'm doing it for her.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.115
Well, I think

12:59.946 --> 13:02.115
that's very nice.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.866
So I'm here for you, Taylor.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.327
- One hundred percent.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.327
- Good.

13:06.369 --> 13:08.580
- Because you're not untalented.

13:06.369 --> 13:08.580
- Thank you.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.541
How about I make you

13:08.622 --> 13:11.541
my right-hand man? Stick by me.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.251
Be me when I'm not here.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.251
What do you say?

13:13.293 --> 13:15.754
Well, I'll need my right hand

13:13.293 --> 13:15.754
back for that, I think.

13:15.794 --> 13:17.838
Oh, of course.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.382
Okay, good.

13:19.424 --> 13:22.510
This is a new side of you,

13:19.424 --> 13:22.510
Luke, and I like it.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.096
Alright,

13:22.552 --> 13:25.096
let's get started, everybody.

13:28.683 --> 13:30.477
(female #1)

13:28.683 --> 13:30.477
'So, which is your favorite

13:28.683 --> 13:30.477
room?'

13:30.518 --> 13:33.313
Oh, that changes daily.

13:30.518 --> 13:33.313
Today it's the library.

13:33.354 --> 13:36.608
- What do you love about it?

13:33.354 --> 13:36.608
- It hugs you, you know?

13:36.650 --> 13:39.110
- Does that sound silly?

13:36.650 --> 13:39.110
- Not at all.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.488
Uh, the kitchen turned out

13:39.152 --> 13:41.488
so wonderfully so, uh

13:41.529 --> 13:43.573
the kitchen and library

13:41.529 --> 13:43.573
are duking it out right now.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.366
I should definitely get

13:43.615 --> 13:45.366
the name of your designer.

13:45.408 --> 13:46.660
Ners, we went through

13:45.408 --> 13:46.660
quite a few.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.369
Really?

13:46.701 --> 13:48.369
The design's so cohesive.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.580
What you see is a lot of me.

13:50.622 --> 13:51.914
Uh, she said that so humbly.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.708
Hey, credit

13:51.956 --> 13:53.708
where credit is due.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.543
I put my soul

13:53.750 --> 13:55.543
into this place

13:55.585 --> 13:58.630
my heart, my liver,

13:55.585 --> 13:58.630
a couple of kidneys

13:58.672 --> 14:00.340
and I had a great partner

13:58.672 --> 14:00.340
in Sookie

14:00.381 --> 14:03.009
and, uh, we had a great

14:00.381 --> 14:03.009
community rooting for us.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.762
That's what you feel here.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.762
Support. Family.

14:05.804 --> 14:08.222
Homeyness, warmth. It must

14:05.804 --> 14:08.222
reflect your upbringing.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.099
- Pfft!

14:08.264 --> 14:10.099
- 'No?'

14:10.141 --> 14:12.519
I'm just happy I wasn't sipping

14:10.141 --> 14:12.519
coffee when you said that.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.978
It would have come out my nose.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.939
Oh, childhood

14:14.020 --> 14:16.939
wasn't so warm and fuzzy?

14:16.981 --> 14:18.899
You know Superman's

14:16.981 --> 14:18.899
"Fortress Of Solitude?"

14:18.941 --> 14:21.653
A Jamaican beach

14:18.941 --> 14:21.653
compared to my mother's house.

14:21.695 --> 14:24.739
Oh, so I'll cross your mother

14:21.695 --> 14:24.739
off your list of inspirations.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.533
No, I actually did pick up

14:24.781 --> 14:26.533
some valuable lessons

14:26.574 --> 14:28.242
on running a staff

14:26.574 --> 14:28.242
from my mother.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.077
- How so?

14:28.284 --> 14:30.077
- 'Well..'

14:30.119 --> 14:32.038
I consider what my mother

14:30.119 --> 14:32.038
would do in a given situation

14:32.079 --> 14:34.457
then I dial it back and I have

14:32.079 --> 14:34.457
what Mussolini would do

14:34.499 --> 14:36.626
then I dial it back,

14:34.499 --> 14:36.626
and I have what Stalin would do

14:36.668 --> 14:39.086
and then I dial that back,

14:36.668 --> 14:39.086
and it starts approaching

14:39.128 --> 14:40.463
what a sane person would do.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.256
- Ouch!

14:40.505 --> 14:42.256
- 'You're right.'

14:42.298 --> 14:44.509
Let's find a topic happier than

14:42.298 --> 14:44.509
my relationship with my mother.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.554
Basically, that'd be anything

14:44.551 --> 14:47.554
short of famine.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.640
Okay, I will tell you one story

14:50.682 --> 14:52.600
about my mother

14:50.682 --> 14:52.600
on a family vacation.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.936
Jimmy Carter was there,

14:52.642 --> 14:55.936
and he had a bigger room.

14:55.978 --> 15:00.024
Alrighty, upstairs floors

14:55.978 --> 15:00.024
and walls cleaned. Check.

15:00.066 --> 15:03.277
And blackout curtains delivered

15:00.066 --> 15:03.277
and ready to be installed.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.988
- Check. Uh, Luke?

15:03.319 --> 15:05.988
- Yeah.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.449
It would really help

15:06.030 --> 15:08.449
to hear you say check.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.117
Uh, I'm-I'm getting it, Taylor.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.661
But how do I know that

15:10.159 --> 15:11.661
unless you say check

15:11.703 --> 15:14.080
after I say check?

15:14.121 --> 15:15.956
Fine.

15:15.998 --> 15:19.168
And audio equipment delivered,

15:15.998 --> 15:19.168
awaiting mounting brackets.

15:19.210 --> 15:22.004
- Check?

15:19.210 --> 15:22.004
- Check.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.339
Excellent.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.801
Boys, boys, what's so funny?

15:26.843 --> 15:28.135
I took the mannequin

15:26.843 --> 15:28.135
by the arms, and I said--

15:28.177 --> 15:29.429
Wait, wait, I'll tell him.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.555
So, he goes,

15:29.470 --> 15:30.555
"Grab the other end"--

15:30.597 --> 15:32.098
No, no I said,

15:30.597 --> 15:32.098
"Grab her end."

15:32.139 --> 15:33.600
Right, so I grabbed her

15:32.139 --> 15:33.600
right here.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.518
- Right under her rear end.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.518
- Her rear end.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.061
I was walking with it like that.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.855
Really, do I have

15:37.103 --> 15:38.855
to separate you two?

15:38.897 --> 15:41.148
Now set that down

15:38.897 --> 15:41.148
and bring in the others.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.276
Modestly.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.820
[both laughing]

15:48.322 --> 15:50.324
So, Gypsy,

15:48.322 --> 15:50.324
find some interesting stuff?

15:50.366 --> 15:52.368
How does a George Washington

15:50.366 --> 15:52.368
letter sound?

15:52.410 --> 15:54.287
- Fantastic.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.287
- Wow, that's great.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.663
Mint condition too.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.498
Let's frame it

15:55.705 --> 15:57.498
and hang it in a place of honor.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.626
Uh, I'm not sure this is

15:57.540 --> 15:59.626
what you think it is.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.419
What do you mean?

15:59.667 --> 16:01.419
It's a letter to the editor.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.129
Of a newspaper

16:01.461 --> 16:03.129
signed George Washington.

16:03.170 --> 16:05.339
- It's dated 1944.

16:03.170 --> 16:05.339
- That's a little smudge.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.801
- That could be 1744.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.801
- It mentions Jack Benny.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.552
Well, we could cross out

16:07.842 --> 16:09.552
the Jack Benny part.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.763
Let's put it

16:09.594 --> 16:11.763
on the to-be-displayed pile

16:11.805 --> 16:13.598
and we'll, uh,

16:11.805 --> 16:13.598
authenticate it a later time--

16:13.640 --> 16:15.975
Uh, actually, why don't we put

16:13.640 --> 16:15.975
it in the maybe pile, Taylor.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.477
There's gotta be better

16:16.016 --> 16:17.477
than this.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.437
You're right.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.437
Let's keep our standards high.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.272
Good thinking, Luke.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.272
Now, Gypsy.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.900
As soon as we have everything

16:21.314 --> 16:23.900
catalogued, my man, Luke here

16:23.942 --> 16:26.068
will liaise with you

16:23.942 --> 16:26.068
to coordinate your needs.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.528
- Right, we'll liaise.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.528
- Fine.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.155
But I'm not doing nothing dirty.

16:29.196 --> 16:30.197
Carry on.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.951
Hey, so we should

16:31.324 --> 16:32.951
start moving this stuff

16:32.992 --> 16:34.786
in the other room,

16:32.992 --> 16:34.786
so we can clean here.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.537
- Luke.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.537
- Yeah.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.498
Taylor would like

16:36.579 --> 16:38.498
to see you in his office.

16:38.539 --> 16:41.793
- What? He was just here.

16:38.539 --> 16:41.793
- That's what he said.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.210
I'll be right back.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.637
[knocking]

16:52.679 --> 16:53.930
(Taylor)

16:52.679 --> 16:53.930
'Come in.'

16:57.642 --> 16:59.560
- You wanted to see me?

16:57.642 --> 16:59.560
- Ah, Luke, yes.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.813
Sit down, won't you?

16:59.602 --> 17:01.813
We need to talk.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.606
Now, if you're going

17:01.855 --> 17:03.606
to disagree with me

17:03.648 --> 17:05.107
which you have every right to,

17:03.648 --> 17:05.107
please

17:05.149 --> 17:06.818
don't do it in front

17:05.149 --> 17:06.818
of the rest of the crew.

17:06.860 --> 17:09.069
- What are you talking about?

17:06.860 --> 17:09.069
- That George Washington letter?

17:09.111 --> 17:10.780
- I was humiliated.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.780
- No, you weren't.

17:10.822 --> 17:12.824
Luke, we're a team.

17:10.822 --> 17:12.824
Don't forget that.

17:12.866 --> 17:16.243
Fine, okay, I won't disagree

17:12.866 --> 17:16.243
with you in front of the crew.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.663
Good, although,

17:16.285 --> 17:18.663
it's probably safest for you

17:18.705 --> 17:20.832
not to disagree with me

17:18.705 --> 17:20.832
at all, don't you think?

17:20.874 --> 17:23.668
- Uh, sure. I agree.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.668
- Good.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.629
- 'Taylor?'

17:23.710 --> 17:26.629
- This is Taylor Doose.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.631
(Kirk)

17:26.671 --> 17:28.631
'The carpenter is here, Taylor.'

17:28.673 --> 17:31.342
Copy that.

17:28.673 --> 17:31.342
Uh, liaise with him, will you?

17:31.384 --> 17:33.761
You took the words

17:31.384 --> 17:33.761
right out of my mouth.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.731
- Where's the guy, Kirk?

17:42.562 --> 17:44.731
- Right over there.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.484
[Kirk and Kyle chattering]

17:55.658 --> 17:57.994
[disco music]

18:04.333 --> 18:06.002
[sighs]

18:06.044 --> 18:07.921
Every one of these people

18:06.044 --> 18:07.921
is dead.

18:07.962 --> 18:10.339
- That makes me sad.

18:07.962 --> 18:10.339
- That movie's from the 60s.

18:10.381 --> 18:12.466
- 'They're not all dead.'

18:10.381 --> 18:12.466
- Well, they're old.

18:12.508 --> 18:15.011
Osteoporosistic. These days,

18:12.508 --> 18:15.011
if they shake it, they break it.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.888
- That makes me sad.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.888
- Switch back to Mahler.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.765
Hey, it was your idea

18:16.930 --> 18:18.765
for me to watch a movie.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.349
It was my idea for you

18:18.806 --> 18:20.349
to do whatever it took

18:20.391 --> 18:21.517
to get your mind off Doyle.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.269
So you're going away, huh?

18:23.310 --> 18:25.521
- No Huntzberger this weekend?

18:23.310 --> 18:25.521
- Obviously not.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.189
You guys were hot and heavy

18:25.563 --> 18:27.189
for a couple of weeks.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.482
- What happened?

18:27.231 --> 18:28.482
- Nothing.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.150
Feast turned into famine, huh?

18:30.192 --> 18:31.986
Fine. If you must know, yes.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.863
See, Paris? I'm not in denial.

18:33.905 --> 18:35.573
Logan and I were hot and heavy.

18:33.905 --> 18:35.573
Had a good two weeks.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.658
Then it became about

18:35.615 --> 18:37.658
voice mails. Then cricket.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.954
So, yes, he pulled back,

18:37.700 --> 18:40.954
and I'm going crazy

18:40.995 --> 18:42.455
but I'm not gonna

18:40.995 --> 18:42.455
stay here and wallow

18:42.496 --> 18:43.748
and watch you be all depressed.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.750
- You're right.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.750
- About what?

18:45.792 --> 18:47.251
About you staying here.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.251
You should get out.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.628
I should get out.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.628
This place is poison.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.630
- It is.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.630
- I don't wanna be like this.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.173
I wanna live my life so that

18:50.671 --> 18:53.173
I'll be able to read an in-depth

18:53.215 --> 18:55.509
biography about myself

18:53.215 --> 18:55.509
in later years and not puke.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.553
- Good.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.553
- I'm going to get up and pack.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.430
And I'm going to have

18:57.595 --> 18:59.430
some fun this weekend.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.347
Good.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.184
- How does this end?

19:02.141 --> 19:04.184
- They dance again.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.603
Okay.

19:07.438 --> 19:10.066
Hey, Zach. Grandy's closes

19:07.438 --> 19:10.066
at 8:00 tonight.

19:10.108 --> 19:11.985
A little early 'cause

19:10.108 --> 19:11.985
it's one of his kids' birthdays

19:12.026 --> 19:14.695
but I checked with Luke,

19:12.026 --> 19:14.695
and he's letting me off at 7:00

19:14.737 --> 19:15.989
so we've got plenty of time.

19:16.030 --> 19:18.324
- For what?

19:16.030 --> 19:18.324
- To shop at Grandy's.

19:18.365 --> 19:19.909
- We set it up last week.

19:18.365 --> 19:19.909
- We did?

19:19.951 --> 19:21.869
- Yes.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.869
- Huh.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.455
Well, could we go next week?

19:24.497 --> 19:26.540
Zach, we haven't hit Grandy's

19:24.497 --> 19:26.540
in four months.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.501
We're completely out

19:26.582 --> 19:28.501
of cleaning supplies.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.587
Well, I can't go tonight,

19:28.542 --> 19:31.587
so just go without me.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.673
But you love shopping

19:31.629 --> 19:33.673
for cleaning supplies.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.800
I know, but tonight,

19:33.714 --> 19:35.800
I've got something to do.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.259
What?

19:37.301 --> 19:39.219
Just gonna go chill

19:37.301 --> 19:39.219
with some friends.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.763
- Who?

19:39.261 --> 19:40.763
- Whoa, officer!

19:40.805 --> 19:41.973
Okay, I confess.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.307
- Body's in the trunk.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.307
- Zach.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.767
I'm just gonna see

19:43.349 --> 19:44.767
some old friends.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.560
God, what do you want?

19:44.809 --> 19:46.560
Names and addresses?

19:46.602 --> 19:48.646
No, fine,

19:46.602 --> 19:48.646
I'll go by myself.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.439
- Good.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.693
And don't forget to get

19:52.150 --> 19:53.693
a dishwashing liquid

19:53.734 --> 19:55.569
that's gentle on my hands.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.488
I will.

20:03.369 --> 20:06.288
- Hello.

20:03.369 --> 20:06.288
- Hi, honey.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.582
This is okay, right? Springing

20:06.330 --> 20:08.582
a surprise visit on you?

20:08.624 --> 20:11.085
This is your definition

20:08.624 --> 20:11.085
of surprise?

20:11.127 --> 20:12.837
This is not a surprise.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.837
Come on in.

20:12.879 --> 20:16.132
- I'll show you a surprise.

20:12.879 --> 20:16.132
- Paris.

20:16.174 --> 20:18.634
I packed my bags and was on the

20:16.174 --> 20:18.634
road before I remembered that

20:18.676 --> 20:20.386
my parents don't own property

20:18.676 --> 20:20.386
in the United States anymore.

20:20.427 --> 20:21.721
Since when?

20:21.762 --> 20:23.681
Since the IRS

20:21.762 --> 20:23.681
red-foxed my father.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.766
The place in Asylum Hill,

20:23.723 --> 20:25.766
the Nantucket cottage

20:25.808 --> 20:28.352
even the crack house in Harlem

20:25.808 --> 20:28.352
that we converted into a co-op

20:28.394 --> 20:29.562
was sold off to one

20:28.394 --> 20:29.562
of the "Queer Eye" guys.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.064
Where did they go?

20:31.105 --> 20:32.439
They're going to wire me

20:31.105 --> 20:32.439
when they're safe.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.400
Anyway, I'm here.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.400
Should I leave?

20:34.441 --> 20:36.569
No, stay.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.569
Um, if it's okay with mom.

20:36.610 --> 20:37.737
It's okay with me.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.279
So I guess

20:37.778 --> 20:39.279
you can have the couch.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.281
- Uh, sorry, that's spoken for.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.281
- What?

20:41.323 --> 20:44.451
Hey, Rory.

20:41.323 --> 20:44.451
This is a nice surprise.

20:44.493 --> 20:46.537
The Maddis' were supposed

20:44.493 --> 20:46.537
to have him tonight.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.497
They have goldfish.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.497
Kirk's afraid of goldfish.

20:48.539 --> 20:51.333
They're always staring at you.

20:48.539 --> 20:51.333
All gold and unblinking.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.878
I like sleeping on the floor

20:51.375 --> 20:53.878
anyway. It's good for my back.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.964
Okay. Enjoy.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.964
Can I, um..

20:57.006 --> 20:58.883
- Mm?

20:57.006 --> 20:58.883
- Mm-hmm.

21:02.302 --> 21:05.389
- So, what inspired your visit?

21:02.302 --> 21:05.389
- Just nothing else to do.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.307
Oh, well, don't I feel special.

21:07.349 --> 21:08.768
Oh, sorry.

21:07.349 --> 21:08.768
You know what I mean.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.228
You mean, I love you, mommy.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.228
I miss you, mommy.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.604
That's what I meant.

21:11.645 --> 21:15.191
So no parties or anything?

21:11.645 --> 21:15.191
No...dates?

21:15.233 --> 21:18.736
No, just a nice, quiet weekend.

21:15.233 --> 21:18.736
It's perfect.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.613
Oh, wait,

21:18.778 --> 21:20.613
you didn't have anything

21:20.654 --> 21:22.698
planned with Luke tonight?

21:20.654 --> 21:22.698
Don't cancel it on my account.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.325
No, it's okay, he's busy,

21:22.740 --> 21:25.325
Taylor's making him drive out

21:25.367 --> 21:27.828
to fetch a historical cannonball

21:25.367 --> 21:27.828
that old man Twickham

21:27.870 --> 21:29.288
had lent to his sister

21:27.870 --> 21:29.288
in Mystic.

21:29.329 --> 21:30.998
What would you borrow

21:29.329 --> 21:30.998
a cannonball for?

21:31.040 --> 21:32.625
- It's been bugging me too.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.625
- Hmm.

21:32.666 --> 21:34.252
So, how'd your

21:32.666 --> 21:34.252
magazine interview go?

21:34.293 --> 21:36.254
Good, I think. I mean,

21:34.293 --> 21:36.254
I've never done one before.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.630
She didn't stab me

21:36.295 --> 21:37.630
with her pencil or anything.

21:37.671 --> 21:38.839
A very good sign.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.758
My interviewer

21:38.881 --> 21:40.758
was really cool. Sandra.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.136
It was more

21:40.800 --> 21:43.136
like...friends chatting

21:43.177 --> 21:44.804
than being interviewed.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.514
She loved the inn,

21:44.845 --> 21:47.514
she asked some good questions

21:47.556 --> 21:50.309
and she<i> loved,</i> loved

21:47.556 --> 21:50.309
my Emily stuff.

21:50.350 --> 21:51.769
- Your Emily stuff?

21:50.350 --> 21:51.769
- Yeah.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.271
She asked me questions

21:51.811 --> 21:53.271
about my background.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.897
I gave it to her, unplugged.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.565
- You didn't.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.565
- She asked.

21:56.607 --> 21:58.484
- But you couched it, right?

21:56.607 --> 21:58.484
- What do you mean?

21:58.525 --> 22:00.736
I mean, you described it

21:58.525 --> 22:00.736
in so many words.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.280
Colorful, but unemotional?

22:02.321 --> 22:03.948
I called her

22:02.321 --> 22:03.948
"the female Pol Pot."

22:03.990 --> 22:05.866
- Mom, you didn't.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.866
- She laughed.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.994
- For like, a minute.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.994
- That's so harsh.

22:08.035 --> 22:10.788
- Harsh but true.

22:08.035 --> 22:10.788
- Can I get some water?

22:10.830 --> 22:12.039
Why are you covering

22:10.830 --> 22:12.039
your eyes, Kirk?

22:12.081 --> 22:13.833
In case you're naked.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.835
You thought I'd walk into my

22:13.874 --> 22:15.835
daughter's room and get naked?

22:15.876 --> 22:17.628
I don't know

22:15.876 --> 22:17.628
your domestic routine.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.379
Glasses are

22:17.670 --> 22:19.379
above the sink.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.966
So, you attribute

22:19.421 --> 22:21.966
any war crimes to grandma?

22:22.008 --> 22:23.759
Any environmental disasters?

22:23.801 --> 22:26.386
What? We were just talking.

22:23.801 --> 22:26.386
She won't print any of it.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.139
Why, was it

22:26.428 --> 22:28.139
off the record?

22:28.181 --> 22:30.016
Yeah, technically.

22:28.181 --> 22:30.016
It wasn't about the inn.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.725
But did you say

22:30.057 --> 22:31.725
"it's off the record"?

22:31.767 --> 22:33.477
- No.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.477
- Then it's fair game.

22:33.519 --> 22:35.229
- So she can print all of it.

22:33.519 --> 22:35.229
- Including the limerick?

22:35.271 --> 22:37.690
- You did your limerick?

22:35.271 --> 22:37.690
- I am very proud of it.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.775
I found<i> two</i> dirty words

22:37.731 --> 22:39.775
that rhyme with "Emily."

22:39.817 --> 22:41.485
- Oh, boy.

22:39.817 --> 22:41.485
- Well.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.361
Can't I call the reporter and

22:41.527 --> 22:43.361
tell her it was off the record?

22:43.403 --> 22:45.531
You can't take things off

22:43.403 --> 22:45.531
the record once they're on.

22:45.572 --> 22:47.365
Well, so what,

22:45.572 --> 22:47.365
the chances that my mother reads

22:47.407 --> 22:49.160
American Travel

22:47.407 --> 22:49.160
are extremely slim.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.368
Yeah, except for the fact

22:50.410 --> 22:52.205
that I told her

22:50.410 --> 22:52.205
about it tonight.

22:52.246 --> 22:53.747
I needed some small talk.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.124
What? And "how are

22:53.789 --> 22:55.124
the girls at the club?"

22:55.166 --> 22:56.917
And "ooh, that's gorgeous,

22:55.166 --> 22:56.917
is it new?"

22:56.959 --> 22:58.836
Doesn't work anymore? Those

22:56.959 --> 22:58.836
are tried and true stand-bys.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.754
Well, I told her about it,

22:58.878 --> 23:00.754
and she jotted down the title.

23:00.796 --> 23:03.132
- She's gonna read it.

23:00.796 --> 23:03.132
- Okay, well.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.591
You know what?

23:04.633 --> 23:05.843
Fine. Let her.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.345
I-It's all true.

23:07.385 --> 23:09.471
I'm tired of protecting people,

23:07.385 --> 23:09.471
of being polite

23:09.513 --> 23:11.431
of worrying

23:09.513 --> 23:11.431
about other people's feelings.

23:11.473 --> 23:12.766
Let her get

23:11.473 --> 23:12.766
all Condoleezza Rice

23:12.808 --> 23:13.934

23:12.808 --> 23:13.934
if she wants.

23:13.976 --> 23:15.311
(Kirk)

23:13.976 --> 23:15.311
'Ow!'

23:15.353 --> 23:17.479
- Kirk, you can open your eyes.

23:15.353 --> 23:17.479
- I'm fine.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.273
- 'Ow, my head!'

23:17.521 --> 23:19.273
- Kirk.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.734
'I'm fine.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.734
Ow, my toe!'

23:21.775 --> 23:24.195
- Kirk!

23:21.775 --> 23:24.195
- 'Ow, my knee!'

23:24.237 --> 23:25.905

[cannonball rolling]

23:43.172 --> 23:44.340
[cannonball bangs]

23:47.260 --> 23:49.511
You were right. We should've

23:47.260 --> 23:49.511
tied the cannonball down.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.222
Taylor, you don't like

23:49.553 --> 23:51.222
to drive after dark

23:51.264 --> 23:52.973
so, we didn't have

23:51.264 --> 23:52.973
time to tie it down.

23:53.015 --> 23:55.351
You didn't have the proper tools

23:53.015 --> 23:55.351
to secure it with, anyway.

23:55.393 --> 23:57.270
- Netting, twine.

23:55.393 --> 23:57.270
- Yes, well, drat my luck.

23:57.311 --> 23:58.979
I took all my

23:57.311 --> 23:58.979
cannonball-securing tools

23:59.021 --> 24:01.732
out of the truck

23:59.021 --> 24:01.732
just yesterday.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.155
It must weigh

24:06.737 --> 24:08.155
about a 100 pounds.

24:08.197 --> 24:10.116
Something like that.

24:10.157 --> 24:11.367
Oh, good, we're in luck.

24:10.157 --> 24:11.367
Hey, Dean!

24:11.409 --> 24:13.160
No, Taylor,

24:11.409 --> 24:13.160
I'll move it myself.

24:13.202 --> 24:14.620
Luke,

24:13.202 --> 24:14.620
don't be headstrong.

24:14.661 --> 24:17.164
Once, I sprained my pecs

24:14.661 --> 24:17.164
lifting a birdbath

24:17.206 --> 24:19.166
and they were

24:17.206 --> 24:19.166
no good to me ever again.

24:19.208 --> 24:22.086
- What do you need, Taylor?

24:19.208 --> 24:22.086
- Got a big, heavy ball here.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.879
How are your pecs?

24:23.921 --> 24:25.131
They're fine.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.091
Help us to the house?

24:31.053 --> 24:33.347
[grunting]

24:35.266 --> 24:37.226
- Look, buddy--

24:35.266 --> 24:37.226
- Where do you want it, Taylor?

24:37.268 --> 24:38.894
Uh, on the lawn is fine.

24:38.936 --> 24:40.604
We'll put it in place

24:38.936 --> 24:40.604
tomorrow morning.

24:43.899 --> 24:46.277
(Taylor)

24:43.899 --> 24:46.277
'Lucky you were here.'

24:46.319 --> 24:49.155
Yeah...lucky.

Breakfast!

25:16.640 --> 25:18.351
- Morning.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.351
- Morning. Rory, you up?

25:18.392 --> 25:20.311
- She's probably on the phone.

25:18.392 --> 25:20.311
- I'm not on the phone.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.771
- I was just getting dressed.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.771
- Coffee?

25:22.813 --> 25:24.898
- Definitely, yes.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.442
So, did you

25:24.940 --> 25:26.442
get any rest?

25:26.484 --> 25:28.526
- Kirk talks in his sleep.

25:26.484 --> 25:28.526
- Anything juicy?

25:28.568 --> 25:30.528
- He deals blackjack.

25:28.568 --> 25:30.528
- Hmm. Kirk?

25:30.570 --> 25:32.072
- 'Yeah?'

25:30.570 --> 25:32.072
- Turn off the TV.

25:32.114 --> 25:34.158
- And come have your breakfast.

25:32.114 --> 25:34.158
- 'In a minute.'

25:34.200 --> 25:36.076
- Now!

25:34.200 --> 25:36.076
- How old is he?

25:36.118 --> 25:38.954
You'd have to cut

25:36.118 --> 25:38.954
him open and count the rings.

25:38.996 --> 25:40.414
- Morning.

25:40.456 --> 25:41.707
- Morning.

25:40.456 --> 25:41.707
- Hmm.

25:41.748 --> 25:43.459
You really should

25:41.748 --> 25:43.459
see a sleep therapist.

25:43.501 --> 25:44.918
- Roulette?

25:43.501 --> 25:44.918
- Blackjack.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.838
- Sorry.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.838
- Kirk, is the TV still on?

25:47.880 --> 25:50.548
- Oh, I forgot.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.548
- No, no, I'll get it.

25:50.590 --> 25:52.343
And you'd forget your head

25:50.590 --> 25:52.343
if it wasn't screwed on.

25:52.385 --> 25:54.261
Don't deny

25:52.385 --> 25:54.261
that you were on the phone.

25:54.303 --> 25:56.805
- Phone's in the living room.

25:54.303 --> 25:56.805
- Oh, that's your phone?

25:56.847 --> 25:58.598
- It rang about an hour ago.

25:56.847 --> 25:58.598
- It was ringing?

25:58.640 --> 26:00.142
- No.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.142
- Knock it off.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.268
What are you guys

26:00.184 --> 26:01.268
talking about?

26:02.353 --> 26:04.021
[sighs]

26:04.063 --> 26:05.231
Fine.

26:06.357 --> 26:08.025
No forts.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.609
Now, I don't know

26:08.067 --> 26:09.609
what all your plans are

26:09.651 --> 26:12.196
but the grand opening

26:09.651 --> 26:12.196
of the Stars Hollow museum

26:12.238 --> 26:13.613
is this morning,

26:12.238 --> 26:13.613
any takers?

26:13.655 --> 26:14.823
It's always amusing

26:13.655 --> 26:14.823
when provincials

26:14.865 --> 26:16.574
grasp for legitimacy,

26:14.865 --> 26:16.574
I'm in.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.077
- I wouldn't miss it.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.077
- I helped build it.

26:18.118 --> 26:19.828
- Bully.

26:18.118 --> 26:19.828
- Alright.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.330
We'll finish up here, grab

26:19.870 --> 26:21.330
your jackets and we'll go.

26:21.372 --> 26:22.580
I don't need a jacket.

26:22.622 --> 26:23.874
Well, it's chilly, Kirk.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.292
I don't wanna

26:23.916 --> 26:25.292
wear a jacket.

26:25.334 --> 26:26.919
Well, then maybe

26:25.334 --> 26:26.919
you won't go

26:26.960 --> 26:29.171
to the grand opening

26:26.960 --> 26:29.171
of the Stars Hollow museum.

26:29.213 --> 26:33.133
- I'll put on my jacket.

26:29.213 --> 26:33.133
- Finish your breakfast first.

26:33.175 --> 26:35.886
Kirk, do not

26:33.175 --> 26:35.886
turn that TV on.

[cartoon on TV]

26:36.970 --> 26:39.348

26:41.100 --> 26:43.685
Please enjoy the museum

26:41.100 --> 26:43.685
and come back for some punch.

26:43.727 --> 26:45.187
Good morning, ladies.

26:45.229 --> 26:46.522
- Hi, Patty.

26:46.564 --> 26:49.442
Oh, I remember you.

26:46.564 --> 26:49.442
You poor thing.

26:49.483 --> 26:50.901
Thanks.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.570
That's $3 each,

26:50.943 --> 26:52.570
but that includes a punch.

26:52.610 --> 26:54.154
Would you

26:52.610 --> 26:54.154
like yours now?

26:54.196 --> 26:56.156
Oh, how about later,

26:54.196 --> 26:56.156
after I eat a loaf of bread

26:56.198 --> 26:59.493
a pound of crackers, and chase

26:56.198 --> 26:59.493
it with a quart of olive oil.

26:59.535 --> 27:02.329
Well, it's not my punch

26:59.535 --> 27:02.329
if it's not strong.

27:02.371 --> 27:03.663
- Hey, you guys coming?

27:02.371 --> 27:03.663
- Oh!

27:03.705 --> 27:05.249
Looks like

27:03.705 --> 27:05.249
we're the first group in.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.750
I'll catch up. I told

27:05.291 --> 27:06.750
Lane I'd meet up with her.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.877
- Okay, see ya.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.877
- Bye.

27:08.919 --> 27:12.005
- How<i> you</i> doing?

27:08.919 --> 27:12.005
- I'm fine.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.591
Doyle's probably

27:12.047 --> 27:13.591
called me at the dorm

27:13.631 --> 27:14.925
and my not

27:13.631 --> 27:14.925
calling him back means

27:14.967 --> 27:16.385
he may

27:14.967 --> 27:16.385
never call me again.

27:16.427 --> 27:17.844
There you go.

27:16.427 --> 27:17.844
There you have it.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.475
I don't wanna buckle.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.475
I really don't wanna buckle.

Here, keep it for me.

you sure?

You got it.

- Hello.

- What's wrong with you?

27:30.316 --> 27:32.776
- I don't wanna talk about it.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.776
- Well, we're a fun group.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.155
- Paris.

- We paid our $3.

Then let it remove

27:39.617 --> 27:42.286

- Here it is.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.583
- Oh, it's nice.

You really turned

27:47.625 --> 27:49.502
this around fast, huh?

27:49.543 --> 27:51.378
Well,

28:12.024 --> 28:15.235
to take the Sears tag off of it.

- "Civil war era cannonball."

- Oh, where's the cannonball?

- Flashlights.

I don't see it.

28:41.261 --> 28:43.472

28:43.514 --> 28:46.016
- Oh.

28:43.514 --> 28:46.016
- Nice.

28:46.058 --> 28:50.312
He just flat-out looked out

28:46.058 --> 28:50.312
of his face right into my face

28:50.354 --> 28:53.649
and said to my face

28:50.354 --> 28:53.649
that he was lying.

28:53.691 --> 28:55.651
Zach said

28:53.691 --> 28:55.651
that he was lying?

28:55.693 --> 28:59.071
No, he lied

28:55.693 --> 28:59.071
from his face into my face

28:59.112 --> 29:01.156
about where he was going,

28:59.112 --> 29:01.156
that's what hurts the most.

29:01.198 --> 29:03.992
The lie. Except for seeing

29:01.198 --> 29:03.992
him with that woman.

29:04.034 --> 29:06.036
That hurts most,

29:04.034 --> 29:06.036
more than the lie.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.830
You'd think they'd

29:06.078 --> 29:08.830
stumble onto the truth.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.374
Just accidentally.

29:10.416 --> 29:13.627

29:13.669 --> 29:16.338
Just because they say so many

29:13.669 --> 29:16.338

29:16.380 --> 29:19.550
- That's like...man!

29:23.679 --> 29:25.805

29:25.847 --> 29:28.350
I bet you, Doyle's

29:25.847 --> 29:28.350

You don't know

29:28.392 --> 29:29.893
that he is spreading.

29:29.935 --> 29:33.146
This...is...tasty.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.190
- I've had it.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.190
- Had what?

29:35.232 --> 29:36.942
I'm getting

29:35.232 --> 29:36.942

Where's

29:51.665 --> 29:53.083

No, Paris, no.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.294

...whoever, yeah.

40:01.774 --> 40:02.817
Huh.

40:02.859 --> 40:05.237
Well, I'll think

40:02.859 --> 40:05.237
about it.

40:07.989 --> 40:10.575
We have got to bring everyone

40:07.989 --> 40:10.575
we know to this immediately

40:10.616 --> 40:13.411
before the Nederlanders swoop in

40:10.616 --> 40:13.411
and whisk it away to broadway.

40:13.452 --> 40:15.496
And at 3 bucks a pop,

40:13.452 --> 40:15.496
that crappy Abba show

40:15.538 --> 40:17.082
cost a 100 bucks.

40:17.123 --> 40:19.167
I gotta make a quick call.

40:17.123 --> 40:19.167
Maybe we'll go through again.

40:19.209 --> 40:21.627
Once is not enough.

40:25.882 --> 40:29.052
Sandra, hi,

40:25.882 --> 40:29.052
it's Lorelai Gilmore again.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.845
Listen,

40:29.094 --> 40:30.845
I was thinking

40:30.887 --> 40:33.598
and I think you should just

40:30.887 --> 40:33.598
pull the article.

40:33.639 --> 40:36.851
Yeah, I'm sure.

40:33.639 --> 40:36.851
But thanks. Bye.

40:36.893 --> 40:38.228
[cellphone beeps]

40:40.772 --> 40:42.982
So, was it all I said

40:40.772 --> 40:42.982
it would be?

40:43.024 --> 40:45.110
Oh! And more.

40:45.151 --> 40:47.237
I've gotta go through with Rory.

40:45.151 --> 40:47.237
Seen her anywhere?

40:47.279 --> 40:48.780
I haven't seen her, no.

40:48.821 --> 40:50.823
- Wow.

40:48.821 --> 40:50.823
- What?

40:50.865 --> 40:53.326
I just never really looked

40:50.865 --> 40:53.326
at this place before.

40:53.368 --> 40:54.786
- 'Those columns, that brick.'

40:53.368 --> 40:54.786
- 'Yeah.'

40:54.827 --> 40:56.204
(Lorelai)

40:54.827 --> 40:56.204
'It's beautiful.'

40:56.246 --> 40:58.039
Yeah. It's a great house.

40:58.081 --> 40:59.999
Mom.

41:00.041 --> 41:01.626
Oh, Rory, honey,

41:00.041 --> 41:01.626
what's wrong?

41:01.667 --> 41:04.129
I don't feel good.

41:01.667 --> 41:04.129
I really don't feel good.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.381
I think I can guess why.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.381
Come on, let's get you home.

41:06.423 --> 41:07.882
You need help?

41:06.423 --> 41:07.882
Want me to drive?

41:07.924 --> 41:10.385
That's okay. It's just

41:07.924 --> 41:10.385
five minutes. Come on.

41:22.439 --> 41:23.856
[sighs]

41:27.402 --> 41:29.988
Okay, Dean, come on.

41:27.402 --> 41:29.988
Don't give me that attitude.

41:30.029 --> 41:31.406
What's up?

41:31.448 --> 41:33.032
What is this? Is this still

41:31.448 --> 41:33.032
about the "Pippi" night?

41:33.074 --> 41:34.367
The bop it?

41:34.409 --> 41:36.577
Fine, you hate me.

41:34.409 --> 41:36.577
Whatever.

41:36.619 --> 41:37.870
You wanna punch me?

41:36.619 --> 41:37.870
Go ahead.

41:37.912 --> 41:39.538
I'm a terrible guy.

41:37.912 --> 41:39.538
I deserve it.

41:39.580 --> 41:41.207
Go ahead, take a shot.

41:39.580 --> 41:41.207
I won't even fight back.

41:41.249 --> 41:42.750
Make you feel better,

41:41.249 --> 41:42.750
huh, buddy?

41:42.792 --> 41:44.085
Just go back

41:42.792 --> 41:44.085
to your girlfriend.

41:44.127 --> 41:45.753
Fine, whatever.

41:45.795 --> 41:47.422
While you got one.

41:47.464 --> 41:48.465
What's that supposed

41:47.464 --> 41:48.465
to mean?

41:48.506 --> 41:49.632
What do you

41:48.506 --> 41:49.632
think it means?

41:49.674 --> 41:51.259
I'm not playing

41:49.674 --> 41:51.259
games here.

41:51.301 --> 41:53.636
Your situation's

41:51.301 --> 41:53.636
no different from mine,<i> buddy.</i>

41:53.678 --> 41:54.929
I've got work to do.

41:54.971 --> 41:56.514
Then go.

41:56.555 --> 41:58.141
They want more than this.

41:58.183 --> 41:59.642
Don't you see that?

41:59.684 --> 42:02.854
And all you<i> are</i> is this.

42:02.895 --> 42:05.106
Rory was a kid, Dean.

42:02.895 --> 42:05.106
She grew up. She moved on.

42:05.148 --> 42:06.732
Accept it.

42:06.774 --> 42:09.402
You accept it.

42:06.774 --> 42:09.402
This town, it's all you are.

42:09.444 --> 42:10.945
And it's not enough.

42:10.987 --> 42:13.614
She's gonna get bored,

42:10.987 --> 42:13.614
and you can't take her anywhere.

42:13.656 --> 42:15.033
You're here forever.

42:15.074 --> 42:17.494
- It's different.

42:15.074 --> 42:17.494
- It's not different.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.996
You and me...same thing.

42:27.879 --> 42:31.257
[crying]

42:31.299 --> 42:33.843
Why doesn't

42:31.299 --> 42:33.843
he like me?

42:33.885 --> 42:35.470
Why doesn't he

42:33.885 --> 42:35.470
call me?

42:35.512 --> 42:37.138
What did I do?

42:37.180 --> 42:40.266
Shh, honey, it's okay.

42:37.180 --> 42:40.266
It's okay.

42:40.308 --> 42:42.894
Mommy, I-I..

42:44.354 --> 42:46.481
Shh. It's okay.
