00:03.069 --> 00:05.403
We did a great job
on this letter.

00:05.404 --> 00:07.739
Yeah! Mark's gonna
fall for this big time.

00:07.740 --> 00:08.940
Here he comes!

00:11.811 --> 00:15.714
Hey, mark! You got a letter
from the detroit pistons.
I did?

00:15.715 --> 00:18.783
Yeah. The return address
says it's from isiah thomas.

00:18.784 --> 00:21.820
See? I told you
he'd write me back.

00:21.821 --> 00:23.688
What does it say?

00:23.689 --> 00:28.093
"dear mark.
Thank you for your 25 letters.
You're my biggest fan."

00:28.094 --> 00:31.096
Does he say
anything else?

00:31.097 --> 00:33.098
"I can't wait to meet you.

00:35.835 --> 00:39.303
"don't tell anybody,
but I'm coming to your
house Saturday night.

00:39.304 --> 00:43.074
P.S. If you're cooking,
I love corn on the cob."

00:43.075 --> 00:44.876
He's coming
to our house!

00:44.877 --> 00:48.980
Yeah! This is gonna
be cool! Yeah!

00:48.981 --> 00:50.682
I'm gonna go put this
in my scrapbook!

00:50.683 --> 00:54.152
Way to go, marcus!
Wow.

00:54.153 --> 00:55.520
Yes!

00:55.521 --> 00:57.522
Oh, we are too good.

02:07.492 --> 02:09.994
Well, what do you think?
Could we put the kids
in the middle?

02:14.800 --> 02:19.003
<i>(all)</i> â™ª happy birthday to you!

02:19.004 --> 02:20.671
<i>(cheering)</i>

02:20.672 --> 02:23.407
Ok, make a wish.
Come on.

02:30.916 --> 02:33.051
<i>(all)</i> yeah!

02:33.052 --> 02:34.285
Now, we eat.

02:34.286 --> 02:38.223
Ok, who wants sleeve,
who wants armpit?

02:38.224 --> 02:40.691
Sleeve.
<i>(brad and randy)</i> pits.

02:40.692 --> 02:42.827
Ok. Tim?

02:42.828 --> 02:46.297
I'll just take
a little chest hair.

02:46.298 --> 02:49.768
So, al, what did
you wish for?

02:49.769 --> 02:53.604
Oh, no. No, no. I couldn't tell
you that or it won't come true.

02:53.605 --> 02:57.642
What are you, al?
Seven? Eight now?

02:57.643 --> 03:02.814
Sorry, tim. It's just that
I'm a little superstitious
about those things.

03:02.815 --> 03:04.749
Yeah?

03:04.750 --> 03:06.751
Well, if you don't tell us
what you wished for,

03:06.752 --> 03:08.452
You're not getting
your present.

03:08.453 --> 03:11.089
Well, if you must know, I...

03:11.090 --> 03:13.057
I wished for a wife.

03:15.394 --> 03:18.496
Hey! Perfect!

03:18.497 --> 03:20.564
That's what we got ya!

03:22.168 --> 03:25.036
Just don't
overinflate her.

03:28.274 --> 03:31.642
Tim, knock it off.
Al has a very good chance
of getting his wish.

03:31.643 --> 03:35.479
In fact, I might have
somebody to introduce you to.
Really?

03:35.480 --> 03:38.216
Back the lonely-heart mobile up.

03:38.217 --> 03:40.551
Stay out of this.
You are the worst matchmaker.

03:40.552 --> 03:43.221
I am not! Besides
this woman is perfect.

03:43.222 --> 03:46.791
What's her name?
I don't know.

03:46.792 --> 03:48.726
So she's a good friend?

03:48.727 --> 03:51.595
She is the sister of the woman
I sit next to at work.

03:51.596 --> 03:55.266
She's supposed to be very sweet.
I'll call beth, get her number,
then call you.

03:55.267 --> 03:58.937
Then you call her,
then you call me and tell me
everything she said.

03:58.938 --> 04:01.639
No, no.
Then you call me.

04:01.640 --> 04:05.944
I'll call eddie,
he'll call freddie,
we'll all get pedicures.

04:05.945 --> 04:07.645
<i>(watch alarm beeps)</i>

04:07.646 --> 04:09.881
Gosh, it's seven already?

04:09.882 --> 04:12.650
I better call the bingo hall,
tell 'em I'm running late.

04:12.651 --> 04:14.518
This isn't your
usual bingo night.

04:14.519 --> 04:16.721
No, I know.

04:16.721 --> 04:20.825
When you're a regular,
they do something special
for you on your birthday.

04:20.826 --> 04:25.263
You get to sit next
to the caller and use
your age as a free space.

04:28.968 --> 04:32.136
Tonight, I'm n35.

04:33.472 --> 04:36.507
You know, it just seems
like yesterday I was i19.

04:39.811 --> 04:42.313
He really needs somebody.

04:45.951 --> 04:49.220
Her name's ilene
and she's an orthodontist.

04:49.221 --> 04:50.321
Who?

04:50.322 --> 04:53.224
The woman that jill
found for me. Thank you

04:53.225 --> 04:54.759
I just spoke to her
on the phone.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.861
She has a delightful
sense of humor.

04:56.862 --> 04:58.363
Listen to this.

04:58.364 --> 05:01.132
How does an orthodontist
hold on to a lawyer?

05:01.133 --> 05:03.701
She makes him a retainer.

05:08.040 --> 05:11.609
I think I know
why she's available.

05:11.610 --> 05:14.345
Well, I've invited her
over for Friday night.

05:14.346 --> 05:16.948
Told her there
would be a few people.

05:16.949 --> 05:19.183
Now I just have to
find a few people.

05:19.184 --> 05:21.752
Would you and jill
like to come?

05:21.753 --> 05:25.156
Can't make it.
And if you were smart,
you wouldn't show up either.

05:25.157 --> 05:28.826
Why?
Jill is the world's
worst matchmaker.

05:28.827 --> 05:31.930
She put seven couples together.
Six are getting divorced.

05:31.931 --> 05:35.366
Well, maybe we would be
like the seventh couple.

05:35.367 --> 05:40.071
The seventh couple
couldn't get married.
Turned out they were cousins.

05:40.072 --> 05:45.009
<i>Does everybody know</i>
<i>what time it is?</i>
<i>It's "tool time"!</i>

05:45.010 --> 05:50.581
That's right! Binford tools
is proud to present
tim "the tool man" taylor!

05:50.582 --> 05:53.418
<i>(cheering and applause)</i>

05:54.286 --> 05:56.787
Thank you.

05:56.788 --> 05:59.757
Thank you all, and welcome
once again to <i>tool time.</i>

05:59.758 --> 06:01.826
I'm your host,
tim "the tool man" taylor,

06:01.827 --> 06:04.362
And you all know my assistant,
al "catch of the day" borland.

06:06.631 --> 06:09.900
It's male hobby week
all this week on <i>tool time.</i>

06:09.901 --> 06:13.404
And today, al and I are doing
our <i>tool time</i> salute...

06:13.405 --> 06:15.473
<i>(fishing reel unwinding)</i>

06:15.474 --> 06:17.275
To fishing.

06:17.276 --> 06:21.012
Hobbies are important to men
because they allow us to wind
down a bit.

06:21.013 --> 06:24.349
I can't speak for everybody, but
I work awful hard all week long.

06:24.350 --> 06:26.284
You have another job
somewhere, tim?

06:29.088 --> 06:32.590
Gosh, darn it.
That was funny, al.
It really was.

06:32.591 --> 06:35.460
Who's writing your material?
An orthodontist?

06:38.030 --> 06:40.631
Bite on that one,
big worm.

06:40.632 --> 06:43.534
Look. We're talking about
fly-fishing today.

06:43.535 --> 06:46.670
To get a good information base,
we've invited a special guest.

06:46.671 --> 06:51.575
I want a warm <i>tool time</i> welcome
for ace angler chuck norwood.

06:51.576 --> 06:53.577
<i>(cheering and applause)</i>

06:57.249 --> 07:01.452
Welcome, chuck.
Thanks, tim. Al.

07:01.453 --> 07:03.321
You brought a nice
selection of rods here.

07:03.322 --> 07:06.357
I'd love to see a worm
try to wiggle off one
of those big bad boys.

07:06.358 --> 07:10.028
Actually, tim, with fly-fishing,
there's no live bait involved.

07:10.029 --> 07:12.430
The fish are drawn
to the fly.

07:12.431 --> 07:15.299
Under the heading of flies,
you've got two basic types.

07:15.300 --> 07:18.102
The opened and closed, chuck.

07:20.906 --> 07:24.075
Chuck meant the dry fly
and the wet fly.

07:24.076 --> 07:28.746
This is a joke, al.
The dry fly floats on top of the
water, whereas your wet fly...

07:28.747 --> 07:32.216
Has kept you out of every major
restaurant in the detroit area.

07:33.952 --> 07:35.619
How about a little
demonstration?

07:35.620 --> 07:41.426
Yeah. This first one
is a real classic.
It's handmade bamboo.

07:41.427 --> 07:44.028
Look at this.
That's a good-looking rod.

07:44.029 --> 07:46.897
The prices for that
start at about...

07:51.937 --> 07:54.772
$800.

07:54.773 --> 07:58.443
Now it's $1600.
You got two of 'em.

07:58.444 --> 08:00.545
We have an insurance policy
for these little accidents.

08:00.546 --> 08:04.115
Actually, our insurance
cancelled after the fourth show.

08:04.116 --> 08:06.984
Well, glue it.
What do we got now?

08:06.985 --> 08:08.819
This next one's
my personal favorite.

08:08.820 --> 08:11.655
This is a morgan bxl graphite.

08:11.656 --> 08:13.357
Not even you can
break that, tim.

08:13.358 --> 08:15.259
Don't bet on it.

08:15.260 --> 08:17.962
That's a beauty.
Look at that thing.

08:17.963 --> 08:20.631
I bet you'd get a big old
stinky bass on this thing.

08:20.632 --> 08:23.901
Hey, al. Open up.

08:23.902 --> 08:27.105
You want to be careful
using a graphite rod
in a lightning storm

08:27.106 --> 08:30.774
Because it is an excellent
conductor of electricity.

08:30.775 --> 08:34.044
We've been known to have
a lot of electrical storms
in the studio.

08:34.044 --> 08:37.780
I'm just saying that if
they happen to be in an area
that is susceptible....

08:48.260 --> 08:50.828
Mom, can we have
corn on the cob
Saturday night?

08:50.829 --> 08:54.031
Sure. Why?
Not supposed to tell.

08:54.032 --> 08:56.667
If you want corn,
you'll tell.

08:56.668 --> 08:58.236
Ok.

08:58.237 --> 09:00.904
Isiah thomas is coming to dinner
and he really loves corn.

09:00.905 --> 09:04.842
Isiah thomas?

09:04.843 --> 09:07.578
You can't say anything
to anybody, ok?

09:07.579 --> 09:09.880
<i>(tim)</i> hey, I'm home.

09:09.881 --> 09:12.816
Oh, I don't believe it.
Well, I'm right here.

09:16.688 --> 09:18.922
What is this?
Brad and randy
wrote to mark

09:18.923 --> 09:20.991
Pretending to be
isiah thomas.

09:20.992 --> 09:23.194
It's not from isiah?

09:23.195 --> 09:27.698
Mark, no professional
basketball player is gonna come
to our house to eat corn.

09:29.801 --> 09:33.604
Especially your mom's corn.

09:33.605 --> 09:36.274
Honey... Look, you're
eight years old now.

09:36.275 --> 09:39.810
It's time that
we had this talk.

09:39.811 --> 09:43.414
Stop being such a sap!

09:43.415 --> 09:46.517
But the letter looked so real.

09:46.518 --> 09:48.886
Let me give you
some guidelines here.

09:51.056 --> 09:53.257
If something good
happens to you,

09:53.258 --> 09:56.126
And brad and randy
are happy that it happened,

09:56.127 --> 09:59.730
It's probably
not a good thing.

09:59.731 --> 10:01.199
I'm gonna get them back!

10:01.200 --> 10:03.734
Wait. What are you
gonna do to 'em?

10:03.735 --> 10:08.206
I'm gonna tell them that they're
ugly and that their feet stink.

10:09.274 --> 10:11.275
<i>(whistles)</i> ouch!

10:13.512 --> 10:17.348
It's probably not
a good idea to tell 'em
stuff they already know.

10:17.349 --> 10:20.017
Think of something,
all right?
Ok.

10:20.018 --> 10:23.987
By the way, keep Friday open.
I got sleepovers
for all the kids.

10:23.988 --> 10:27.425
We are going out.
All right!

10:27.426 --> 10:30.494
We almost got roped
into going to al's house.
Where are we going?

10:30.495 --> 10:34.164
Al's house.
No!

10:34.165 --> 10:37.000
More dip?
No, thank you, al.

10:37.001 --> 10:39.036
Dipped out,
big fella.

10:44.008 --> 10:47.211
Don't worry, al.
Ilene'll be here any minute.

10:53.452 --> 10:55.253
Any minute.

10:55.254 --> 10:58.956
Boy, I should take a look
at that rack of lamb before
it dries out.

11:02.628 --> 11:04.962
She's 30 minutes late.
She's not coming. Let's eat.

11:04.963 --> 11:10.268
She's coming. Stop whining.
Try to say something supportive.

11:10.269 --> 11:12.136
Nice butt, al.

11:15.407 --> 11:17.207
<i>(doorbell)</i>

11:17.208 --> 11:18.976
Well, that's probably her now.

11:23.315 --> 11:26.484
Hi.
Hi.

11:26.485 --> 11:28.552
Al?
Ilene?

11:30.289 --> 11:33.023
Would you like to come on in?
Come on in.

11:33.024 --> 11:35.926
Hi. I'm jill.
I work with beth.
Nice to meet you.

11:35.927 --> 11:38.929
And the man behind the cheese
ball is my husband tim.
Hi.

11:38.930 --> 11:42.900
This is very exciting for me.
I'm a big fan of the show.

11:42.901 --> 11:45.235
You are so funny.
Thank you very much.

11:45.236 --> 11:48.972
And al.
So competent.

11:51.743 --> 11:55.145
Thanks. Would you like
something to drink?

11:55.146 --> 11:57.448
That'd be great.
Uh... Wine?

12:02.153 --> 12:04.054
This really isn't like me,
being late.

12:04.055 --> 12:06.156
Normally I am right on time.
Or early.

12:06.157 --> 12:10.494
What a coincidence.
Al is always early.
Isn't that right, tim?

12:10.495 --> 12:13.063
Yeah. Sometimes he shows up
before he's invited.

12:14.833 --> 12:17.267
I just couldn't get out
of the office.

12:17.268 --> 12:19.236
Then on the way over
here my car stalled.

12:19.237 --> 12:22.239
I'll take a look at it.
Al should look at it.

12:22.240 --> 12:25.976
Ilene, I would love
to look under your hood.

12:25.977 --> 12:30.080
I mean... I mean of your car!
Of her car!

12:30.081 --> 12:32.282
Al, you have a great
sense of humor.

12:32.283 --> 12:34.652
A sense of humor is very
important in a relationship.

12:34.653 --> 12:38.155
If I didn't have a sense
of humor, I never would have
been able to stay with tim.

12:40.659 --> 12:41.859
<i>(beeping)</i>

12:41.860 --> 12:43.461
How long have you
two been married?

12:43.462 --> 12:46.029
It seems like forever.

12:46.030 --> 12:47.732
In a good way.

12:47.733 --> 12:51.635
Children?
Yes. We have three
delightful boys.

12:51.636 --> 12:53.738
And who would <i>they</i> be?

12:55.374 --> 12:59.309
I myself would love
a big family.

12:59.310 --> 13:04.281
Me too. Although I'm 36
and I worry it's a little
late to be getting started.

13:04.282 --> 13:07.518
Oh, no. You have plenty
of good childbearing years left.

13:09.755 --> 13:13.190
It's not only that.
It's the whole process.

13:13.191 --> 13:14.925
First you have
to meet somebody,

13:14.926 --> 13:18.429
Then you have to date,
see if the chemistry's right.

13:18.430 --> 13:20.498
I wish there was a way
to cut through that.

13:20.499 --> 13:23.200
So do I.
You do?

13:23.201 --> 13:25.403
You know, I...

13:25.404 --> 13:28.038
I wouldn't want to be
too forward, but I...

13:28.039 --> 13:31.241
I would love to be
the father of your children.

13:42.587 --> 13:45.289
Do you mind if we eat first?

13:52.030 --> 13:56.767
"I'd love to be the father
of your children."

13:56.768 --> 14:02.840
I still can't believe
the woman didn't go running out
of the apartment, screaming.

14:02.841 --> 14:06.944
That's 'cause she's just
as desperate as he is.

14:06.945 --> 14:10.581
Honey, you've got
to applaud yourself.
They're a perfect match.

14:10.582 --> 14:13.651
We gotta talk to al.
What are you doing?
Don't talk... No.

14:13.652 --> 14:15.453
They're going way too fast.
Way too fast.

14:15.454 --> 14:17.321
She practically moved in
before dessert.

14:17.322 --> 14:20.290
Her car stalls once
on the way over,
and by the end of the night,

14:20.291 --> 14:22.025
She thinks she can't
make it home?

14:22.026 --> 14:26.263
"oh, gee, al. Maybe I'd better
stay on your couch."

14:26.264 --> 14:28.499
How long is she gonna be
alone on that couch?

14:28.500 --> 14:31.068
Knowing al, six months.
Come on!

14:31.069 --> 14:32.336
Hang up.

14:32.337 --> 14:34.772
You are just not
getting this at all.

14:34.773 --> 14:37.174
These people are not
acting rationally.

14:37.175 --> 14:38.742
<i>You're</i> not acting rationally.

14:38.743 --> 14:42.145
Hey, you cannot
build a relationship
based on desperation.

14:42.146 --> 14:44.682
<i>We</i> did!

14:44.683 --> 14:47.952
Tim, they were
naming their babies.

14:47.953 --> 14:49.319
They were joking.

14:49.320 --> 14:52.823
They laughed when I said,
"call it tim." remember?

14:52.824 --> 14:55.659
Hang up.
Not until you promise me
you'll call them.

14:55.660 --> 14:58.662
All right. I won't call al,
I'll talk to him tomorrow. Ok?

14:58.663 --> 15:01.499
It's a waste of time.
They'll work it out.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.468
When you're in
a new relationship,
you're on an emotional high.

15:04.469 --> 15:08.105
But after a while,
you come crashing down
to reality. I know <i>I</i> did.

15:20.451 --> 15:23.921
Happy hour, wilson?
<i>(chuckles)</i>

15:23.922 --> 15:26.089
No! No, no, no, tim.

15:26.090 --> 15:30.060
I find that two coats of bourbon
give my paintings a nice gloss.

15:30.061 --> 15:34.598
Two coats of bourbon will
give anybody a nice gloss.

15:34.599 --> 15:37.601
Tim, it was rumored
that the mona lisa

15:37.602 --> 15:39.970
Was covered with
a splash of whiskey.

15:39.971 --> 15:43.340
That would explain why she had
that little plastered look.

15:43.341 --> 15:45.943
Actually, tim, that look
may have had more to do

15:45.944 --> 15:49.780
With her supposed relationship
with leonardo da vinci.

15:49.781 --> 15:52.182
I don't wanna talk
about relationships today.

15:52.183 --> 15:55.586
Problem, tim?
Yeah. Jill's
driving me nuts.

15:55.587 --> 15:57.487
She fixes al up
with a girl he likes.

15:57.488 --> 16:00.190
Now she thinks they're
moving too fast
and wants to break 'em up.

16:00.191 --> 16:03.928
Why do women meddle
in relationships?
Men don't care about that.

16:03.929 --> 16:06.196
Uh-oh. You're falling victim
to a cultural stereotype.

16:06.197 --> 16:09.066
Historically, men have been
the primary matchmakers.

16:09.067 --> 16:11.869
<i>(grunts quizzically)</i>
<i>(grunts)</i>

16:11.870 --> 16:14.304
For example, among
the xhosa kaffir tribe,

16:14.305 --> 16:18.308
A young man's father
would choose his first,
sometimes even his second, wife

16:18.309 --> 16:22.479
In exchange for a sack
of barley or a goat.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.982
I'd hold out for a sack
of cash and a jag.

16:27.452 --> 16:30.854
You see, unlike
the ancient matchmakers,

16:30.855 --> 16:32.422
Who received goods
for their services,

16:32.423 --> 16:34.491
Jill's motives are much purer.

16:34.492 --> 16:36.827
She only wants
what's best for al.

16:36.828 --> 16:38.295
But why does she
drag <i>me</i> into it?

16:38.296 --> 16:40.631
Who the heck knows?
You know women.

16:44.302 --> 16:48.171
Ok, mom. Here's the fake letter.
We're gonna get them great!

16:48.172 --> 16:49.907
Boy, this is a big
moment for you.

16:49.908 --> 16:51.809
Your first prank
against your brothers.

16:51.810 --> 16:53.611
You came up with it
all by yourself.

16:53.612 --> 16:56.780
Mom, this is only the beginning.

16:59.484 --> 17:01.151
Hi, guys.
How you doing?

17:01.152 --> 17:03.420
Ah, so tonight's
the big night, eh, mark?

17:03.421 --> 17:05.489
I hope you have
enough corn for isiah.

17:05.490 --> 17:08.458
Hey, mark. Look at this.
You got a letter
from isiah thomas.

17:08.459 --> 17:11.595
Wow! Another letter.

17:17.969 --> 17:21.805
Cool! Isiah's leaving me five
tickets to the bulls game!

17:21.806 --> 17:23.941
Wait a second.
Let me see that.

17:25.676 --> 17:29.513
Oh, man. Courtside seats
for the whole family.

17:29.514 --> 17:31.181
All we have to do
is present the letter.

17:31.182 --> 17:34.151
Wait a minute.
Let me see that.

17:34.152 --> 17:36.386
Right. We're invited
to the locker room

17:36.387 --> 17:38.321
To get an autographed
game ball after that?

17:38.322 --> 17:41.458
Oh, my gosh,
I can't believe it!
Oh, my gosh, I can't either.

17:41.459 --> 17:43.994
Well, I don't believe it.
Did you guys write this?

17:43.995 --> 17:46.530
No! I swear!
Really, mom,
we didn't.

17:46.531 --> 17:50.167
Yeah, we wrote
the other one!
They wrote the other one!

17:50.168 --> 17:52.602
Yeah, but this one's real!
Wait a minute.

17:52.603 --> 17:54.138
You wrote a fake letter?

17:54.139 --> 17:56.874
Yeah, but this one's real.
This one's real.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.576
I don't believe it.
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

17:59.577 --> 18:01.812
No!
Come on!

18:01.813 --> 18:03.781
<i>(brad)</i> I got this piece.

18:03.782 --> 18:05.983
Tim! Tim.

18:05.984 --> 18:09.386
Mark wrote that letter.

18:09.387 --> 18:11.755
I knew that.
We're all in this together.

18:11.756 --> 18:13.390
Suckers, suckers.

18:15.493 --> 18:18.195
Nice try, dad.
I knew he did that.

18:18.196 --> 18:21.198
Guys, go on up
and wash your hands.
Good job!

18:21.199 --> 18:23.300
Can I go up
and tease 'em?
Absolutely.

18:23.301 --> 18:24.601
Thank you.

18:24.602 --> 18:26.704
Great!

18:26.705 --> 18:28.806
I'm gonna clean up
and get to work.

18:28.807 --> 18:31.775
Don't forget
to talk to al about ilene.

18:31.776 --> 18:33.343
I got a better idea.

18:33.344 --> 18:36.914
I'm thinking maybe
I'll bring 'em over,
both of them.

18:36.915 --> 18:38.849
They can watch
how we are together.

18:38.850 --> 18:41.384
I'm sure they'll decide
they're much better off single.

18:44.322 --> 18:47.424
Ford part, obviously.
Mustang, '67.

18:47.425 --> 18:48.892
You know it, tim.

18:48.893 --> 18:52.462
I have over 700 wheel covers
and hubcaps in my collection
at home.

18:52.463 --> 18:56.033
Wow! That takes a lot of space.
You must have a real
understanding wife.

18:56.034 --> 18:58.568
She left me, tim.

18:58.569 --> 19:00.838
She said it was either
her or the hubcaps.

19:00.839 --> 19:02.706
Hate to hear that.

19:02.707 --> 19:05.743
But I think you made
the decision most of us
would have made.

19:05.744 --> 19:09.213
Right, al?
I don't think so, tim.

19:09.214 --> 19:12.916
I would never trade wheel covers
for the love of a good woman.

19:12.917 --> 19:16.820
And, unlike you,
I have never used the show
as my personal forum.

19:16.821 --> 19:19.456
I would like to say something
to my special lady.

19:19.457 --> 19:21.358
What are you gonna do?
Speak from the heart.

19:21.359 --> 19:23.360
Al, don't do this. Al!

19:23.361 --> 19:25.996
<i>(tim)</i> it was good to have
you on the show. Thanks.

19:25.997 --> 19:29.266
Dr. Ilene markham.
I, albert borland,

19:29.267 --> 19:32.136
Would like to spend
the rest of my life with you.

19:32.137 --> 19:34.204
Will you marry me?
<i>(laughs)</i>

19:34.205 --> 19:36.774
That's great. Great.
That's great.

19:36.775 --> 19:39.209
What are you doing?
I'm proposing.

19:39.210 --> 19:41.544
Are you crazy?
He's crazy.
Crazy in love.

19:41.545 --> 19:44.381
Oh, boy! Aren't you?
Aren't we all?

19:44.382 --> 19:47.417
That's all the time we have.
Klaus, the music, please.
Thank you.

19:47.418 --> 19:50.420
That's it for <i>tool time.</i>
See you next time.

19:50.421 --> 19:52.089
Thank you very much.

19:52.090 --> 19:53.523
<i>(woman)</i> you're clear.

19:53.524 --> 19:54.758
Are you out of your mind?

19:54.759 --> 19:57.094
On the contrary.
I've never felt clearer.

19:57.095 --> 19:59.029
You've only known
her a couple of days!

19:59.030 --> 20:01.064
Yes, but I know
everything about her.

20:01.065 --> 20:03.533
Is she married?
I don't know.

20:03.534 --> 20:06.203
Is she from around here?
I don't know.

20:06.204 --> 20:09.739
Is she allergic to flannel?
Does she have any weird tattoos?

20:09.740 --> 20:11.809
Can she digest
asparagus properly?

20:11.810 --> 20:13.043
I don't know!

20:13.044 --> 20:14.544
What <i>do</i> you know
about her?

20:14.545 --> 20:16.613
I do know that I like her.

20:16.614 --> 20:19.283
And I want to start a family
before I get too old.

20:19.284 --> 20:21.852
What?
Well, you know...

20:21.853 --> 20:26.323
My father was almost 60
when I was born.

20:26.324 --> 20:29.092
I didn't know that.
Yeah, well, I...

20:29.093 --> 20:33.096
Thank you.

20:33.097 --> 20:36.266
When we would go to the park,
we would sit
and feed the pigeons

20:36.267 --> 20:39.102
While I would watch the other
kids play ball with their dad.

20:41.472 --> 20:43.841
60 is a ways off, buddy.

20:43.842 --> 20:47.677
And getting married
is a big step.

20:47.678 --> 20:49.880
It's, um...

20:49.881 --> 20:51.648
It's like when you
bought your saber saw.

20:51.649 --> 20:55.152
You didn't buy
the first one you saw.
Of course not!

20:55.153 --> 20:57.687
You went back to the hardware
store a couple of times,
looked at a few of 'em,

20:57.688 --> 20:59.723
To make sure
there's no surprises.

20:59.724 --> 21:02.492
Well, yeah.
That's... True.

21:02.493 --> 21:03.793
Women are like that.

21:03.794 --> 21:05.762
You don't want
to marry a saber saw

21:05.763 --> 21:11.634
And wake up one day
and find yourself lying
next to a... Jackhammer.

21:11.635 --> 21:14.338
So, what you're saying is,

21:14.339 --> 21:15.906
You don't want to
go to bed with one tool

21:15.907 --> 21:18.242
And wake up with another.

21:22.580 --> 21:26.250
Ideally, you don't want
to be going to bed with tools.

21:26.251 --> 21:30.120
You know what
I'm driving at here, al?

21:30.121 --> 21:32.356
Yes, I do.

21:32.357 --> 21:34.724
Oh, but, tim,

21:34.725 --> 21:37.427
I've already proposed.
It's gonna be on the air
in a few hours.

21:37.428 --> 21:39.429
I think I got that covered.

21:39.430 --> 21:41.365
Really?
Yeah.

21:41.366 --> 21:44.902
What do you say you and I
go over to the park
and play a little catch?

21:44.903 --> 21:47.771
That'd be great. Then maybe
we could feed the pigeons.

21:47.772 --> 21:50.774
Let's not get
carried away, al.

21:50.775 --> 21:56.780
<i>I'd say this is a mustang,</i>
<i>probably '67.</i>
<i>You know it, tim.</i>

21:56.781 --> 21:59.649
He really proposes
to her on the air?
Yeah, yeah.

21:59.650 --> 22:01.785
Why didn't you stop him?
I couldn't.

22:01.786 --> 22:05.188
He was like a belt sander
headed for some pine.

22:05.189 --> 22:07.291
What will happen
when she sees this?

22:07.292 --> 22:09.192
Covered, covered.

22:10.895 --> 22:12.195
<i>Dr. Ilene markham.</i>

22:12.196 --> 22:14.965
<i>I, albert borland,</i>
<i>would like to spend...</i>

22:14.966 --> 22:16.699
<i>(tim's voice) Tuesday night.</i>
<i>...With you.</i>

22:16.700 --> 22:18.701
<i>(electronic voice</i>
<i>with japanese accent)</i>

22:22.640 --> 22:25.943
<i>Look, it's godzilla.</i>

22:25.944 --> 22:29.246
<i>The city's in danger.</i>
<i>It's godzilla!</i>

22:29.247 --> 22:32.615
<i>It's not,</i>
<i>it's your mother!</i>

22:39.457 --> 22:43.760
Dear mark.

22:43.761 --> 22:47.197
Sorry it's taken me
so long to write back,

22:47.198 --> 22:48.999
But I've been really busy.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.169
<i>(woman)</i> isiah, honey,
come to dinner.
In a minute.

22:52.170 --> 22:56.340
I gotta write back to this kid.
He's written me 25 times.

22:56.341 --> 22:58.275
Your corn's getting cold.

23:01.312 --> 23:04.314
<i>(woman)</i> isiah, honey.
Come to dinner.
In a minute.

23:04.315 --> 23:08.785
I've gotta write back to this
kid. He's written me 25 times.

23:08.786 --> 23:13.556
Come on, zeke, man.
Forget the kid.
The corn's on, buddy.

23:13.557 --> 23:15.492
We got plenty of corn.

23:15.493 --> 23:19.329
There's pimentos with it.
Come on, buddy.

23:19.330 --> 23:21.731
Come on, I said.
