WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:03.033
(Thunder rumbling)

00:03.034 --> 00:06.106
Heading into the east wing
for 10:00 P.M. bed check. Over.

00:06.107 --> 00:09.039
(Man) Copy that. East
wing, 10:00 P.M. bed check.

00:09.040 --> 00:12.543
(Rainfall)

00:17.017 --> 00:19.750
Get in bed, Samantha.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.755
Die! Die! Die!

00:25.756 --> 00:27.057
Colleen.

00:27.058 --> 00:29.799
(Panting) I'm sorry.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.431
Where's Renee?

00:31.432 --> 00:33.404
She's gone far away.

00:34.635 --> 00:35.765
Code green in east wing.

00:35.766 --> 00:39.239
Renee Caldwell is missing.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.041
(Man) Copy that. Code green,
Renee Caldwell. (Water running)

00:42.042 --> 00:43.613
(Static hisses)

00:43.614 --> 00:47.177
Security, be advised we
are on code green lockdown.

00:47.178 --> 00:49.249
(Hinges squeak)

00:49.250 --> 00:50.580
(Water continues running)

00:50.581 --> 00:53.654
Renee! Are you in here?

00:56.827 --> 00:59.059
Oh, my god.

01:00.331 --> 01:03.233
(Dunn) Victim's name is
Renee Caldwell, 15 years old.

01:03.234 --> 01:04.694
Last seen at dinner last night.

01:04.695 --> 01:06.696
Roommate says she never
made it back to their room

01:06.697 --> 01:08.298
for lights out.

01:08.299 --> 01:10.840
A nurse found the body during
their 10:00 P.M. bed check.

01:10.841 --> 01:13.343
Thanks, officer Dunn.

01:13.344 --> 01:15.575
You're welcome, detective.

01:15.576 --> 01:19.079
(People speaking indistinctly)

01:22.153 --> 01:24.083
What, are you marking
your territory or what?

01:24.084 --> 01:26.586
In your dreams. But she was.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.689
Something going
on between you two?

01:29.690 --> 01:31.561
Absolutely nothing,
I assure you.

01:31.562 --> 01:33.723
Ooh, it didn't
seem like nothing.

01:33.724 --> 01:35.094
Trust me.

01:35.095 --> 01:38.097
I'm saving myself
for someone special.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.430
(Exhales)

01:40.431 --> 01:43.533
(Camera shutter clicking)

01:43.534 --> 01:45.236
(Sighs)

01:46.707 --> 01:49.509
She's in full rigor. Been
dead at least 12 hours.

01:49.510 --> 01:50.680
Maybe less.

01:50.681 --> 01:52.842
The room was full of
steam when I got here.

01:52.843 --> 01:54.214
Were the showers on?

01:54.215 --> 01:56.686
All of 'em... Full
blast, high heat.

01:56.687 --> 01:59.849
Could the hot steam have
accelerated the rigor mortis?

01:59.850 --> 02:03.122
Mm. Look at you, learning stuff.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.554
I read a little.

02:04.555 --> 02:05.855
Smart killer.

02:05.856 --> 02:07.597
Strike in the shower

02:07.598 --> 02:09.859
and then watch all the
evidence wash down the drain.

02:09.860 --> 02:11.801
That's a nasty blow
to the head, too.

02:11.802 --> 02:13.803
Three blows, all
in the same place

02:13.804 --> 02:15.835
with a blunt object.

02:15.836 --> 02:16.906
So we haven't turned
up a murder weapon yet.

02:16.907 --> 02:18.568
Any idea what we're looking for?

02:18.569 --> 02:20.170
There's too much blood to tell.

02:20.171 --> 02:22.141
We'll know more once
we get her cleaned up.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.874
Renee was a, uh,
paranoid schizophrenic.

02:24.875 --> 02:27.146
It's rare in somebody so young.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.848
Strong girl.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.850
She was committed to...

02:30.851 --> 02:32.852
Getting out of here,
moving on with her life.

02:32.853 --> 02:35.855
It makes what happened
all the more tragic.

02:35.856 --> 02:38.288
Do you have any
idea who did this?

02:38.289 --> 02:40.730
I'm concerned about the
safety of my other patients.

02:40.731 --> 02:43.333
Could someone have just
walked into the building?

02:43.334 --> 02:45.465
No, everybody has
to sign in with security

02:45.466 --> 02:47.737
and, uh, all the guests
have been accounted for.

02:47.738 --> 02:49.439
Could somebody have broken in?

02:49.440 --> 02:50.770
It's unlikely.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.802
Security does an
hourly perimeter check

02:52.803 --> 02:55.345
to ensure all windows
and doors are locked.

02:55.346 --> 02:56.506
There's been no breach.

02:56.507 --> 02:58.708
Then Renee was
probably killed by a patient

02:58.709 --> 03:01.781
or... an employee.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.953
It looks that way,
unfortunately.

03:03.954 --> 03:05.555
Well, we'd like to start

03:05.556 --> 03:07.287
talking to the girls
as soon as possible.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.618
Of course.

03:08.619 --> 03:11.391
But I insist on being
present during the interviews.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.192
Oh, that's not how it works.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.964
Well, I have a
responsibility to protect

03:14.965 --> 03:16.626
the young women in my care,

03:16.627 --> 03:18.968
many of whom are in
a delicate mental state.

03:18.969 --> 03:20.970
Being questioned
by two strangers

03:20.971 --> 03:22.632
could be disturbing,

03:22.633 --> 03:24.504
possibly even damaging.

03:24.505 --> 03:25.735
I can't allow you to be there.

03:25.736 --> 03:27.377
Well, then I can't
allow the interviews.

03:27.378 --> 03:30.510
Are you impeding
our investigation?

03:30.511 --> 03:32.712
My hospital, my rules.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.585
If you don't like it,
get a court order.

03:35.586 --> 03:36.886
So Renee was your roommate.

03:36.887 --> 03:38.648
Did you guys get along okay?

03:38.649 --> 03:39.789
Yeah,

03:39.790 --> 03:41.921
till she lied to me.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.424
What did she lie to you about?

03:44.425 --> 03:47.527
She promised never to leave me.

03:47.528 --> 03:51.701
Now she's dead, and
I'll be alone forever.

03:51.702 --> 03:53.733
So do you know anyone who
would want to harm Renee?

03:53.734 --> 03:54.934
Yep.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.736
Definitely.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.308
Who would that be?

03:58.309 --> 04:00.440
Me.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.672
Okay.

04:02.673 --> 04:04.744
Tell us how you did it.

04:04.745 --> 04:08.848
I lured her into the showers
and smashed her head in.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.481
Not like my last victim.

04:11.482 --> 04:12.922
Uh, who... who was that?

04:12.923 --> 04:16.255
(Whispers) President
John F. Kennedy.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.928
At least that case is solved.

04:18.929 --> 04:20.930
I should've asked
her about Jimmy hoffa.

04:20.931 --> 04:23.463
We've got no
witnesses, no evidence.

04:23.464 --> 04:24.794
We're on fire.

04:24.795 --> 04:25.866
(Gasps) Oh.

04:27.398 --> 04:29.369
I'm so sorry.

04:29.370 --> 04:32.373
(People speaking indistinctly)

04:34.345 --> 04:35.875
I'm not crazy.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.877
I shouldn't even be here.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.579
And I know you've
heard that a lot today,

04:39.580 --> 04:40.750
but it's the truth.

04:40.751 --> 04:42.782
Why'd you give me this note?

04:42.783 --> 04:44.754
I know who killed Renee.

04:44.755 --> 04:47.858
Okay. We're listening.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.060
Last night, I saw a
man climbing down

04:51.061 --> 04:52.762
from the heating
vent in the hallway,

04:52.763 --> 04:54.063
right outside my room.

04:54.064 --> 04:55.595
What did he look like?

04:55.596 --> 04:56.926
It was too dark. I
couldn't see his face.

04:56.927 --> 05:00.570
What makes you so
sure he killed Renee?

05:00.571 --> 05:03.573
Because he came here to kill me

05:03.574 --> 05:05.705
because of what I know.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.737
That's why I'm here...

05:07.738 --> 05:10.039
To keep me from
telling the truth.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.581
Then why did he kill Renee?

05:11.582 --> 05:12.912
By mistake.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.744
She lives just across the hall.

05:14.745 --> 05:17.517
What do you know, darby?

05:17.518 --> 05:18.989
(Door opens)

05:21.091 --> 05:23.593
Please believe
me. I'm not crazy.

05:23.594 --> 05:24.955
Let's go, darby.

05:49.420 --> 05:50.750
(Tommy) Well, that was a bust.

05:50.751 --> 05:51.951
I don't know.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.983
Darby seemed different
than the other girls.

05:53.984 --> 05:55.755
Yeah, a different kind of crazy.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.457
Yeah, that's exactly my point.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.859
She doesn't seem
that crazy to me.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.831
Well, neither did
j.F.K.'S assassin.

06:01.832 --> 06:04.734
Yeah. Okay. You're right.

06:04.735 --> 06:06.766
Will you say that again?

06:06.767 --> 06:08.868
I want to use it
for my ringtone.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.040
If darby says that she saw a guy

06:11.041 --> 06:12.842
climbing out of
the heating vent,

06:12.843 --> 06:15.545
don't you think that you
should at least check it out?

06:15.546 --> 06:18.508
Okay, I'll have c.S.U.
Process the vent.

06:18.509 --> 06:21.151
Thank you.

06:28.519 --> 06:29.859
Thanks for coming, mom.

06:29.860 --> 06:31.561
Quality time with
my only child...

06:31.562 --> 06:32.862
I wouldn't miss it.

06:32.863 --> 06:34.424
But I can see by
the look on your face

06:34.425 --> 06:36.726
that this is not
a social call, so...

06:36.727 --> 06:37.867
What's going on, Megan?

06:37.868 --> 06:39.569
I know you don't want to talk

06:39.570 --> 06:42.171
about daddy's suicide note.

06:42.172 --> 06:46.536
The lab found a partial print.

06:46.537 --> 06:48.908
Not enough for
an I.D., but enough

06:48.909 --> 06:52.181
to determine...
It wasn't daddy's.

06:52.182 --> 06:53.713
And of course you
believe that this print

06:53.714 --> 06:56.446
belongs to your father's killer?

06:56.447 --> 06:57.817
It's a possibility.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.789
There are a
thousand explanations

06:59.790 --> 07:01.551
for this fingerprint

07:01.552 --> 07:03.523
that don't mean murder.

07:03.524 --> 07:06.696
Right, which is why I
need to see the body.

07:06.697 --> 07:08.057
Oh, I see what's going on here.

07:08.058 --> 07:11.731
Now you need me to sign
an exhumation notice so that...

07:11.732 --> 07:15.434
Mom, I want this to be
over as much as you do.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.136
I seriously doubt that.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.809
Then just sign
the order, please.

07:19.810 --> 07:21.871
I need to do this.

07:21.872 --> 07:23.873
A-And if I find
nothing on the body...

07:23.874 --> 07:25.615
It's not a body.

07:25.616 --> 07:28.648
It's your father.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.521
If I don't find anything

07:31.522 --> 07:33.152
on the body,

07:33.153 --> 07:36.055
I swear to you,
I will let it go.

07:36.056 --> 07:39.859
Have you given a
second thought as to

07:39.860 --> 07:42.091
my feelings about this,

07:42.092 --> 07:44.994
about how this
could affect my life?

07:44.995 --> 07:47.097
I just want the truth.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.001
No matter who it hurts.

07:53.674 --> 07:54.804
I'm sorry.

07:54.805 --> 07:56.646
I'm not signing.

07:56.647 --> 07:58.549
But... (Scoffs)

08:00.711 --> 08:01.881
(Door opens)

08:01.882 --> 08:03.153
(Door closes)

08:10.561 --> 08:12.221
Hey. What are you doing here?

08:12.222 --> 08:14.493
Just returning your call.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.126
Isn't that usually
done by phone?

08:17.127 --> 08:18.828
Yeah, but then I
wouldn't get to have

08:18.829 --> 08:20.169
the pleasure of your company.

08:20.170 --> 08:22.602
(Chuckles) What
can I do for you?

08:22.603 --> 08:25.535
I need help getting
an exhumation order.

08:25.536 --> 08:26.776
Who you want to dig up?

08:26.777 --> 08:28.639
My father.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.842
He died when I was 12,

08:32.843 --> 08:36.185
and I grew up thinking
that he killed himself.

08:36.186 --> 08:38.017
Now you're not so sure?

08:38.018 --> 08:41.821
Recently, I got ahold
of his suicide note.

08:41.822 --> 08:45.855
And the lab ran a test,
found a partial print.

08:45.856 --> 08:47.757
Wasn't his.

08:47.758 --> 08:49.559
And you think he was murdered.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.000
Yes, I do.

08:51.001 --> 08:54.063
But I know this is...
It's asking a lot of you.

08:54.064 --> 08:56.166
I'll see what I can do.

08:57.608 --> 08:58.868
What?

08:58.869 --> 09:00.740
(Laughs)

09:00.741 --> 09:02.011
I don't know. It's just,

09:02.012 --> 09:03.843
everybody else has been
telling me why I'm wrong,

09:03.844 --> 09:06.746
and I guess I expected
you to do the same.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.247
I trust your instincts.

09:08.248 --> 09:12.082
You tell me something's
off, I believe you.

09:13.784 --> 09:15.785
(Megan) Cause of
death was most likely

09:15.786 --> 09:20.289
an acute subdural hematoma
to the frontal parietal area.

09:20.290 --> 09:22.892
The hemorrhage was caused
by several blows to the skull

09:22.893 --> 09:24.834
in quick succession

09:24.835 --> 09:26.035
with a blunt instrument.

09:26.036 --> 09:28.768
What did the killer use
as a murder weapon?

09:28.769 --> 09:30.900
(Curtis) I got three
depressed skull fractures,

09:30.901 --> 09:32.972
but too small for a hammer.

09:32.973 --> 09:36.646
Yeah, but not too small
for a ball peen hammer.

09:36.647 --> 09:37.747
You might be right.

09:37.748 --> 09:39.979
So how does somebody inside

09:39.980 --> 09:43.052
a mental institution get
access to a ball peen hammer?

09:43.053 --> 09:45.885
Unless the killer
came from the outside.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.787
(Ethan) Hey.

09:47.788 --> 09:51.922
Check out this trace
from her left shoulder.

09:53.724 --> 09:55.825
It's odorless but thick,

09:55.826 --> 09:57.927
like petroleum jelly.

09:57.928 --> 09:59.769
Explains why the shower
didn't wash it away.

09:59.770 --> 10:02.231
Bad luck for the
killer. Good luck for us.

10:02.232 --> 10:03.933
(Cell phone rings and beeps)

10:03.934 --> 10:05.635
What's up, Tommy?

10:05.636 --> 10:07.877
Hey. Turns out darby's
little sister was murdered

10:07.878 --> 10:09.038
two years ago.

10:09.039 --> 10:10.740
Got the lead
detective from the case

10:10.741 --> 10:12.742
coming to give
us a crash course.

10:12.743 --> 10:14.644
On my way.

10:14.645 --> 10:17.086
(Man) Beth stone was 5 years
old at the time of her death.

10:17.087 --> 10:19.088
She'd gained
some local attention

10:19.089 --> 10:20.750
as a child beauty queen.

10:20.751 --> 10:22.922
Her mother Julia was raising
her two daughters alone

10:22.923 --> 10:25.324
after the death of her husband.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.896
On the night in question,

10:26.897 --> 10:28.898
Julia had put Beth to bed early

10:28.899 --> 10:32.201
so she could watch
TV alone with darby.

10:32.202 --> 10:33.362
(TV playing indistinctly)

10:33.363 --> 10:34.904
(Man) An hour later,

10:34.905 --> 10:36.906
they heard Beth screaming
from her bedroom.

10:36.907 --> 10:38.207
(Screaming)

10:38.208 --> 10:39.969
Beth?

10:39.970 --> 10:41.911
Honey?

10:41.912 --> 10:43.813
As they entered her room,

10:43.814 --> 10:46.415
both reported
seeing a male suspect

10:46.416 --> 10:49.919
fleeing out the window.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.781
(Gasping)

10:51.782 --> 10:53.853
They found Beth in bed...

10:53.854 --> 10:55.785
Dead from multiple stab wounds.

10:55.786 --> 10:57.286
(Megan) What did
the body tell you?

10:57.287 --> 10:59.088
Cause of death
was exsanguination

10:59.089 --> 11:01.060
due to aortic laceration.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.832
Got a profile on the killer?

11:02.833 --> 11:05.795
Single white male
in his mid to late 20s,

11:05.796 --> 11:06.966
a loner.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.138
Any chance that he knew Beth?

11:09.139 --> 11:11.300
I've always believed
he spotted Beth

11:11.301 --> 11:13.873
at one of her beauty pageants.

11:13.874 --> 11:16.305
Those things are a
magnet for pedophiles.

11:16.306 --> 11:17.676
Mm.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.009
Do you think my guy
also killed your victim?

11:20.010 --> 11:21.911
It's not likely.

11:21.912 --> 11:22.883
We're still getting
some background

11:22.884 --> 11:24.053
on darby right now, though.

11:24.054 --> 11:26.315
Well, keep me in the loop.

11:26.316 --> 11:29.759
I still keep a picture
of Beth in my wallet.

11:29.760 --> 11:33.122
It'll stay there until
I catch the bastard.

11:33.123 --> 11:35.795
You want to interview
darby? (Door closes)

11:35.796 --> 11:37.096
That's right.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.368
How nice of you to ask
my permission this time.

11:39.369 --> 11:40.900
So what did darby tell you?

11:40.901 --> 11:42.902
Darby claims that a male suspect

11:42.903 --> 11:45.334
climbed out of the heating vent
across the hall from her room

11:45.335 --> 11:46.906
the night of the murder.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.407
Well, this explains why
there's a crime scene unit

11:48.408 --> 11:50.039
crawling around in my ceiling.

11:50.040 --> 11:53.783
She also believes that she
was the killer's intended target

11:53.784 --> 11:55.444
and that Renee
was killed by mistake.

11:55.445 --> 11:56.946
Two days ago,

11:56.947 --> 11:58.147
darby didn't want to
go to her group meeting

11:58.148 --> 11:59.488
so she went to the infirmary

11:59.489 --> 12:01.120
and she was complaining
about back pain.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.251
I assure you,

12:02.252 --> 12:04.994
the man in the vent
is equally fictitious.

12:04.995 --> 12:06.896
What was darby's
diagnosis again?

12:06.897 --> 12:08.798
You know I can't
discuss that with you.

12:08.799 --> 12:09.959
How convenient.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.831
You don't get it, do you?

12:11.832 --> 12:13.462
Until you find Renee's killer,

12:13.463 --> 12:15.965
all of my patients are at risk.

12:15.966 --> 12:18.407
We want to talk to darby
and we want to talk to her now.

12:18.408 --> 12:19.909
Well, now is not a good time.

12:19.910 --> 12:21.871
Why not?

12:21.872 --> 12:24.113
What are you hiding, doctor?

12:24.114 --> 12:26.216
(Door opens)

12:28.318 --> 12:29.979
Darby?

12:29.980 --> 12:31.150
Huh?

12:31.151 --> 12:32.751
Darby, can you hear me?

12:32.752 --> 12:34.924
(Mutters)

12:34.925 --> 12:36.886
What the hell did you give her?

12:36.887 --> 12:38.788
Mild sedative.

12:38.789 --> 12:40.960
This is not mild.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.462
You're punishing her for
talking to us behind your back.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.464
Don't you dare presume
to judge my decision.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.096
You're only here
because I'm allowing it.

12:47.097 --> 12:48.938
Darby's my patient.

12:48.939 --> 12:50.439
Don't even try to play
the doctor card with me.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.872
You're way out of your league.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.274
Megan, let's go.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.947
We'll be back tomorrow
with your court order.

12:57.948 --> 13:00.349
She better be lucid and alert.

13:00.350 --> 13:01.982
You understand me?

13:10.420 --> 13:11.790
Malcolm is definitely
keeping darby sedated

13:11.791 --> 13:12.962
so she can't talk to us.

13:12.963 --> 13:14.163
Well, he's
definitely got an ego.

13:14.164 --> 13:17.266
But it's possible that
darby had a manic episode.

13:17.267 --> 13:19.168
Oh, so it's just a coincidence?

13:19.169 --> 13:20.469
Like it's a coincidence
that he didn't want us

13:20.470 --> 13:22.171
talking to his other
patients alone?

13:22.172 --> 13:23.472
Megan, you just
need to ask yourself

13:23.473 --> 13:25.174
if you're being objective here.

13:25.175 --> 13:26.405
Really, do I?

13:26.406 --> 13:28.077
Yes. You've got a
14-year-old daughter at home.

13:28.078 --> 13:29.378
It's only natural
you're gonna start

13:29.379 --> 13:31.310
feeling protective of darby.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.012
Tommy, I'm a big girl.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.144
I can separate my
feelings from the case.

13:35.145 --> 13:36.315
And maybe you're right.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.017
Maybe darby's making
the whole thing up.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.318
But no one should have

13:39.319 --> 13:41.851
that much power
over other people.

13:41.852 --> 13:43.252
I found something,
detective Sullivan.

13:43.253 --> 13:44.994
Please tell me it's
the murder weapon.

13:44.995 --> 13:46.155
(Chuckles) No such luck,

13:46.156 --> 13:47.097
but the vent's pretty
banged up inside.

13:47.098 --> 13:48.427
Someone definitely used it

13:48.428 --> 13:50.129
to climb down from
the roof and enter here.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.431
How do you know it wasn't
damaged before the murder?

13:52.432 --> 13:53.963
They just had a
routine inspection.

13:53.964 --> 13:55.604
It was fine three days ago.

13:55.605 --> 13:57.967
There's more. We also
found trace amounts

13:57.968 --> 14:00.269
of this thick, sticky substance.

14:00.270 --> 14:01.971
Which the suspect
could've left behind

14:01.972 --> 14:03.612
when he accidentally
touched the vent cover.

14:03.613 --> 14:05.144
I sent a sample to the lab.

14:05.145 --> 14:08.117
We found a similar
substance on Renee's body.

14:08.118 --> 14:09.378
If that matches,

14:09.379 --> 14:10.920
then whoever came
through this vent killed Renee.

14:10.921 --> 14:14.524
And it confirms darby's story.

14:21.191 --> 14:23.562
Dr. Malcolm's letting
you talk to me alone?

14:23.563 --> 14:25.594
Didn't have a choice.

14:25.595 --> 14:28.397
Your story checks out, darby.

14:28.398 --> 14:31.100
And we also know
about your sister.

14:31.101 --> 14:35.204
So we are here...

14:35.205 --> 14:37.446
Just to listen.

14:37.447 --> 14:40.080
Thank you.

14:41.511 --> 14:43.953
You know, the scariest part
about being committed here

14:43.954 --> 14:47.216
is that overnight, no one
believes a word you say anymore.

14:47.217 --> 14:50.289
Everything out of your
mouth just sounds crazy.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.590
Even the truth.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.892
Especially the truth.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.595
So let's assume you
were the real target

14:56.596 --> 14:58.167
and not Renee.

14:58.168 --> 15:00.100
Who would want to kill you?

15:02.172 --> 15:03.672
My mother.

15:03.673 --> 15:06.275
Darby, I thought you
said you saw a man

15:06.276 --> 15:08.407
going down a vent.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.280
Yes. She hired him to kill me.

15:11.281 --> 15:14.414
And why would she do that?

15:17.117 --> 15:20.250
Darby, it's okay.

15:21.651 --> 15:24.624
(Crying) I saw her
kill my little sister.

15:26.626 --> 15:29.358
Darby, there's no
evidence linking your mother

15:29.359 --> 15:31.160
to Beth's murder.

15:31.161 --> 15:33.502
She destroyed
it. The knife, too.

15:33.503 --> 15:35.304
Yeah, but in the police report,

15:35.305 --> 15:36.635
you and your mother both said

15:36.636 --> 15:38.467
you saw Beth's killer
leaving through a window.

15:38.468 --> 15:40.439
No, my mom made me lie.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.971
She said if I didn't,

15:41.972 --> 15:45.114
child services would
come, and I'd have no one.

15:45.115 --> 15:48.517
So you covered up for her?

15:48.518 --> 15:50.279
I tried to.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.680
(Sniffles)

15:51.681 --> 15:54.053
For six months, Beth
was in my nightmares,

15:54.054 --> 15:56.626
begging me to stand up for her.

15:58.428 --> 16:00.289
I finally realized
that... (Sniffles)

16:00.290 --> 16:01.430
If I didn't tell the truth,

16:01.431 --> 16:03.692
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself.

16:03.693 --> 16:05.134
(Continues crying)

16:05.135 --> 16:07.136
Mom caught me
trying to call the police

16:07.137 --> 16:09.198
and freaked out.

16:09.199 --> 16:12.301
That's why she sent me here...

16:12.302 --> 16:14.173
To shut me up.

16:14.174 --> 16:18.147
Nobody believes
a mental patient.

16:18.148 --> 16:20.149
(Tommy) But, darby, you've
been here for two years.

16:20.150 --> 16:22.111
Why would your
mother wait that long?

16:22.112 --> 16:24.183
Why would she suddenly
decide now to kill you?

16:24.184 --> 16:25.684
I think Dr. Malcolm told her

16:25.685 --> 16:28.387
that he couldn't
control me anymore.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.119
Malcolm's in on this?

16:30.120 --> 16:31.290
Yes.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.292
He knows I'm not really crazy.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.764
My mother pays him to
make sure I keep quiet.

16:35.765 --> 16:37.426
Why do you think
he's been trying so hard

16:37.427 --> 16:39.098
to keep you away from me?

16:39.099 --> 16:41.200
(Sniffles)

16:41.201 --> 16:44.503
I'm so scared.
(Continues crying)

16:44.504 --> 16:47.307
Will you help me?

16:54.384 --> 16:55.614
(Elevator bell dings)

16:55.615 --> 16:57.116
Megan, you just gotta calm down.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.787
I want to talk to darby's
mother right now.

16:58.788 --> 17:00.519
We will, as soon as I can check

17:00.520 --> 17:02.191
the financial connection
between her and Malcolm.

17:02.192 --> 17:03.322
What, you don't believe her?

17:03.323 --> 17:05.224
It's just a really
elaborate story.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.795
For all we know, Renee's murder

17:06.796 --> 17:08.797
has nothing to do
with darby at all.

17:08.798 --> 17:11.500
Evidence proved her
right about the heating vent.

17:11.501 --> 17:13.202
Doesn't mean she's
right about everything.

17:13.203 --> 17:14.403
And she is a mental patient.

17:14.404 --> 17:15.564
I don't know, Tommy.

17:15.565 --> 17:17.706
I looked her right in the eye...

17:17.707 --> 17:19.468
I believe her.

17:19.469 --> 17:20.639
(Water spritzes)

17:20.640 --> 17:22.211
Hey.

17:22.212 --> 17:24.573
What brings you here?

17:24.574 --> 17:29.078
Just dropping off
some paperwork.

17:29.079 --> 17:31.080
Well, nice to see you.

17:31.081 --> 17:32.551
Actually, I came to see you.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.483
Can I ask you something?

17:34.484 --> 17:35.654
Sure.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.256
This might seem
a little awkward,

17:37.257 --> 17:40.429
but I just want to make sure
I'm not stepping on any toes.

17:40.430 --> 17:42.761
Okay.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.134
Is something going on between
you and detective Sullivan?

17:45.135 --> 17:47.296
That's none of your business.

17:47.297 --> 17:48.537
Look, I'm just asking

17:48.538 --> 17:50.399
because Tommy and I
went out a few weeks ago.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.342
Like a...

17:53.343 --> 17:55.574
"Date" date?

17:55.575 --> 17:57.576
Yeah, to a flyers game.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.278
And we had a great time.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.710
But if you two are involved...

18:01.711 --> 18:04.513
I-I just need to know
what to do here.

18:04.514 --> 18:08.258
Hey, you do whatever you want.

18:10.820 --> 18:12.521
(Tommy) So...

18:12.522 --> 18:15.324
Darby claims that the murderer
killed Renee by accident

18:15.325 --> 18:17.326
that she was actually
the intended victim,

18:17.327 --> 18:20.269
and that you
orchestrated it all.

18:20.270 --> 18:21.830
That is ridiculous.

18:21.831 --> 18:24.203
She also says you killed Beth.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.104
My daughter's a very sick girl.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.138
So you're saying it isn't true.

18:29.139 --> 18:30.839
Of course not.

18:30.840 --> 18:33.183
I'm sorry. I had to ask.

18:36.486 --> 18:41.220
I apologize. I know you're
just trying to do your job.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.822
But it is very hard for me to
hear about darby's delusions.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.595
They're why I had her
committed in the first place.

18:46.596 --> 18:50.159
I'm sure this is very
stressful on you.

18:50.160 --> 18:53.432
(Exhales deeply)

18:53.433 --> 18:55.404
What do you want from me?

18:55.405 --> 18:56.905
The law prohibits Dr. Malcolm

18:56.906 --> 18:59.708
from disclosing
darby's diagnosis.

18:59.709 --> 19:02.311
We were hoping
you could tell us.

19:02.312 --> 19:04.613
Darby has borderline
personality disorder

19:04.614 --> 19:07.316
with psychosis.

19:07.317 --> 19:11.320
Was that triggered by
the murder of her sister?

19:11.321 --> 19:14.152
Uh, no, but it did
push her over the edge.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.154
So her symptoms
appeared previously?

19:16.155 --> 19:18.156
I really don't know
when it started.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.629
She was always a very...

19:20.630 --> 19:22.691
Emotionally fragile child.

19:22.692 --> 19:24.563
Is there any documentation

19:24.564 --> 19:27.396
of this illness from childhood?

19:27.397 --> 19:29.238
(Swallows)

19:29.239 --> 19:31.169
No.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.601
Why would that matter?

19:32.602 --> 19:34.303
Oh, it's just interesting.

19:34.304 --> 19:37.175
Most mental
patients have a long,

19:37.176 --> 19:39.948
well-documented
history of their illness

19:39.949 --> 19:42.311
before they're committed.

19:42.312 --> 19:45.684
All darby had was... Your word.

19:45.685 --> 19:49.918
You're beginning to
believe my daughter's lies.

19:49.919 --> 19:52.891
So it's not true that
you and Dr. Malcolm

19:52.892 --> 19:55.294
colluded to kill darby?

19:55.295 --> 19:57.266
No.

19:57.267 --> 19:59.968
See, this is typical darby.

19:59.969 --> 20:01.670
She turns everyone
who tries to help her

20:01.671 --> 20:02.831
into her mortal enemy.

20:02.832 --> 20:04.633
We've done a
little investigating

20:04.634 --> 20:06.335
into your financials.

20:06.336 --> 20:09.338
You've donated quite a
bit of money to the hospital.

20:09.339 --> 20:12.811
So that means that
I killed my daughter?

20:12.812 --> 20:15.213
You tell me.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.515
I gifted that money

20:16.516 --> 20:19.588
because I believe in
Dr. Malcolm's work.

20:19.589 --> 20:21.790
Or you paid him off
to keep darby silent.

20:21.791 --> 20:23.422
How dare you.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.694
I did not have her committed
'cause I want to get rid of her.

20:25.695 --> 20:27.696
I want to help her so that
she can come home someday.

20:27.697 --> 20:29.498
And that is why I
told Dr. Malcolm

20:29.499 --> 20:31.400
that he could start
this new treatment.

20:31.401 --> 20:33.962
What treatment?

20:33.963 --> 20:35.464
Electroshock therapy?

20:35.465 --> 20:37.235
Electroconvulsive therapy.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.268
Darby's been deeply depressed
ever since Renee's death.

20:39.269 --> 20:41.670
She's not depressed.
She's... she's terrified.

20:41.671 --> 20:42.971
Dr. Hunt, I had no idea

20:42.972 --> 20:45.243
you had credentials
in psychiatry.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.317
E.c.t. Is like playing Russian
roulette with her brain.

20:48.318 --> 20:51.350
It's controversial
because it's unpredictable.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.951
I've had more success
treating depression with e.C.T.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.323
Than prescription meds.

20:54.324 --> 20:55.984
It also causes memory loss.

20:55.985 --> 20:57.986
Or maybe that's the point.

20:57.987 --> 20:59.828
Okay, look, can we just
hold off on the procedure

20:59.829 --> 21:01.029
till we get to the
bottom of this?

21:01.030 --> 21:02.731
Maybe as a gesture
of good faith...

21:02.732 --> 21:05.033
I'm all out of good
faith, detective.

21:05.034 --> 21:06.395
You're intruding in the therapy

21:06.396 --> 21:07.866
of a very sick girl

21:07.867 --> 21:10.739
who, contrary to your
baseless accusations,

21:10.740 --> 21:12.270
I'm trying to help.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.572
We think that her
mother hired somebody

21:13.573 --> 21:15.043
to break in here and kill darby.

21:15.044 --> 21:17.746
Maybe with a little
help from the inside.

21:17.747 --> 21:19.348
You should listen to yourself.

21:19.349 --> 21:22.711
Why? You think
I'm going crazy, too?

21:22.712 --> 21:24.983
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.386
An appeal can take weeks to get.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.859
Let me know when you have one.

21:33.062 --> 21:34.323
(Man) Thanks.

21:34.324 --> 21:37.566
Well, somebody
looks properly sedated.

21:44.334 --> 21:45.934
Yep.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.510
I'll be right back
to strap her in.

21:51.511 --> 21:52.582
Okay.

only want what's good for you.

Darby escaped?

22:58.908 --> 23:00.449
Less than an hour ago.

23:00.450 --> 23:01.750
Apparently she
attacked Dr. Malcolm

23:01.751 --> 23:03.752
just as he was
about to start e.C.T.

23:03.753 --> 23:05.884
Oh, Jesus. I don't blame her.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.556
I've got ten units that
are combing the streets.

23:07.557 --> 23:09.418
Darby's got an aunt
lives just outside the city.

23:09.419 --> 23:10.559
She may try to contact her.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.390
I think we should
head out there now.

23:12.391 --> 23:13.662
She'll show up.

23:13.663 --> 23:15.464
Hope so. Don't want to
see anyone else get hurt.

23:15.465 --> 23:16.895
She was protecting herself.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.528
Megan, we don't know
what this girl's capable of.

23:19.529 --> 23:21.069
I just got a call
from Dr. Malcolm.

23:21.070 --> 23:23.001
He's filing a
complaint against us.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.833
Been a few of those lately.

23:24.834 --> 23:26.134
Based on what?

23:26.135 --> 23:27.636
He blames you
for darby's escape.

23:27.637 --> 23:29.007
(Laughs) Why?

23:29.008 --> 23:30.509
I don't know. Maybe
it has something to do

23:30.510 --> 23:32.140
with you validating
darby's delusions,

23:32.141 --> 23:33.642
which then triggered
her manic episode.

23:33.643 --> 23:34.813
Oh, please.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.585
He's blaming me
to cover his own ass.

23:36.586 --> 23:38.717
Maybe. Or maybe he's right.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.519
Excuse me?

23:40.520 --> 23:43.151
Dr. Malcolm is a
highly respected

23:44.594 --> 23:45.754
So am I.

29:38.908 --> 29:42.511
It's positive for human blood.

29:43.983 --> 29:48.417
I want to see darby's
mom explain that away.

29:50.359 --> 29:51.990
(Tommy) The blood d.N.A.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.561
Extracted from the Pearl
matches your dead daughter.

29:53.562 --> 29:56.424
Makes a pretty strong
case that you killed her.

29:56.425 --> 29:58.897
No. No, that's a lie.

29:58.898 --> 30:01.099
Julia, pressure had been
building up for a while now.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.101
Your husband gets
cancer, he dies,

30:03.102 --> 30:05.803
leaves you alone to raise
two girls all by yourself.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.836
The bills start piling up.

30:07.837 --> 30:09.177
Beth is throwing
tantrums all the time.

30:09.178 --> 30:10.979
I'm surprised you could
even hear yourself think.

30:10.980 --> 30:12.810
Something had to give.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.543
No, I loved Beth. I-I
would never hurt her.

30:15.544 --> 30:18.816
Why did we find her
blood on your pearls?

30:18.817 --> 30:20.388
I don't know.

30:20.389 --> 30:22.451
Just admit what you did.

30:24.123 --> 30:26.424
(Voice breaks) Okay. Yes.

30:26.425 --> 30:29.557
I destroyed the evidence.

30:29.558 --> 30:32.360
(Crying) But I could
never hurt my sweet angel.

30:32.361 --> 30:35.935
If you didn't kill
Beth, who did?

30:37.967 --> 30:39.267
Darby.

30:39.268 --> 30:41.509
(Crying)

30:41.510 --> 30:44.542
You really have
no shame, do you?

30:44.543 --> 30:46.044
Ohh.

30:46.045 --> 30:47.515
But if you're capable
of killing one daughter,

30:47.516 --> 30:49.547
why not try to pin
it on the other?

30:49.548 --> 30:51.951
Please. Would you
just listen to me?

30:53.582 --> 30:56.054
I put Beth to bed
early that night.

30:56.055 --> 30:58.856
And Beth would not
stop screaming and...

30:58.857 --> 31:02.931
I went upstairs to try
to calm her down, twice.

31:02.932 --> 31:05.433
But, uh...

31:05.434 --> 31:07.495
Darby went up the third time.

31:07.496 --> 31:10.169
And the screaming stopped.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.573
But darby didn't come back down.

31:16.545 --> 31:19.548
(TV playing indistinctly)

31:24.083 --> 31:26.284
(Julia) So I went
to check on them.

31:26.285 --> 31:27.455
(Door creaks)

31:27.456 --> 31:30.488
(Gasps) Ah! Aah! No!

31:30.489 --> 31:33.421
It just didn't even
seem real. Aah!

31:33.422 --> 31:35.663
And I didn't have time
to think. I just reacted.

31:35.664 --> 31:37.895
I...

31:37.896 --> 31:41.329
I made darby
undress in the shower,

31:41.330 --> 31:43.972
and I took her
clothes and my clothes

31:43.973 --> 31:46.475
and the knife and
I just dumped it all.

31:48.938 --> 31:53.141
That's how Beth's blood
got on my necklace.

31:53.142 --> 31:55.483
If that's true, then why'd
you lie to the police?

31:55.484 --> 31:58.246
To protect darby.

31:58.247 --> 31:59.687
I don't buy it.

31:59.688 --> 32:02.590
You don't protect
your child's killer.

32:02.591 --> 32:04.592
You do if the killer
is also your child,

32:04.593 --> 32:07.455
and she's all
that you have left.

32:07.456 --> 32:09.627
(Sobs)

32:09.628 --> 32:12.260
You're very convincing.

32:12.261 --> 32:16.004
And I would believe you...

32:16.005 --> 32:17.605
If you hadn't tossed

32:17.606 --> 32:20.038
darby aside

32:20.039 --> 32:23.141
like a piece of trash
to hide what you did.

32:23.142 --> 32:25.143
You weren't protecting her.

32:25.144 --> 32:29.217
You were protecting yourself,
just like you're doing now.

32:29.218 --> 32:31.479
What kind of mother are you?

32:31.480 --> 32:34.622
No. (Sobs)

32:34.623 --> 32:36.455
Oh.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.560
(People speaking indistinctly)

32:42.561 --> 32:44.362
You looking for Dr. Hunt?

32:44.363 --> 32:46.364
You know, sometimes I think
she senses I'm coming over

32:46.365 --> 32:47.996
and she just disappears.

32:47.997 --> 32:49.497
(Chuckles) Oh, she
has spidey sense.

32:49.498 --> 32:52.000
No doubt about that. Especially
when she's mad at you.

32:52.001 --> 32:53.271
You know where she went?

32:53.272 --> 32:54.602
Yeah, darby was
released from custody.

32:54.603 --> 32:55.743
She's driving her down
to her aunt's house.

32:55.744 --> 32:57.275
Said she'd be
back in a few hours.

32:57.276 --> 32:58.546
Thanks.

32:58.547 --> 33:00.008
(Ethan) Detective
Sullivan, I got the lab results

33:00.009 --> 33:01.679
on the sticky substance
we found in the vent

33:01.680 --> 33:03.381
and Renee's shoulder.

33:03.382 --> 33:06.584
It was a-a tricky I.D.
Multiple ingredients.

33:06.585 --> 33:07.655
What is it?

33:07.656 --> 33:09.587
It's a polymer-based
ibuprofen ointment

33:09.588 --> 33:11.119
called dolgit.

33:11.120 --> 33:13.161
It's used for muscle
aches and pains.

33:13.162 --> 33:14.622
Wait a second.

33:14.623 --> 33:16.624
Darby went to the
infirmary for back pain

33:16.625 --> 33:18.126
just hours before
Renee was killed.

33:18.127 --> 33:19.567
Is it possible she got
this stuff on her hands

33:19.568 --> 33:20.568
and didn't realize it?

33:20.569 --> 33:22.070
That puts her in direct contact

33:22.071 --> 33:24.532
with the vent and Renee's body.

33:24.533 --> 33:27.405
Oh, no. Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

33:27.406 --> 33:29.678
Darby killed Renee.
I gotta warn Megan.

33:33.482 --> 33:37.245
Will I have to go
back to the institution?

33:37.246 --> 33:39.587
Well, you'll have to have
a psychiatric evaluation.

33:39.588 --> 33:42.320
And then go before a judge,

33:42.321 --> 33:44.392
who will make
the final decision.

33:44.393 --> 33:47.325
But you have
nothing to worry about.

33:47.326 --> 33:52.061
The evidence is
overwhelmingly in your favor.

33:53.532 --> 33:56.135
Thank you for believing me.

33:57.636 --> 34:00.208
Thank you for believing in me.

34:00.209 --> 34:01.669
(Cell phone rings)

34:01.670 --> 34:03.241
Hey, Tommy.

34:03.242 --> 34:05.243
Megan, I need you to
listen to me very carefully,

34:05.244 --> 34:06.474
but do not let darby

34:06.475 --> 34:07.775
see you react.

34:07.776 --> 34:09.278
Okay.

34:10.579 --> 34:12.120
I'm at the m.E.'S office.

34:12.121 --> 34:13.321
It's starting to look like
darby actually killed Renee,

34:13.322 --> 34:14.482
and if that's true,

34:14.483 --> 34:17.825
she probably killed
her sister as well.

34:17.826 --> 34:19.527
Yeah, she's doing great.

34:19.528 --> 34:21.229
She's just relieved not to
be back in that institution.

34:21.230 --> 34:22.560
Megan, listen.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.832
Leave your phone on so we
can track your GPS location.

34:24.833 --> 34:26.594
I'm coming to get you.

34:26.595 --> 34:29.537
Okay. Talk to you later.

34:29.538 --> 34:31.839
That was detective Sullivan.

34:31.840 --> 34:34.643
He was just checking
to see how you're doing.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.649
You're a good liar, Dr. Hunt.

34:41.850 --> 34:44.212
But not as good as me.

34:44.213 --> 34:45.383
(Clicks seat belt release)

34:45.384 --> 34:47.515
No! Darby!

34:47.516 --> 34:49.488
(Tires squeal)

34:53.392 --> 34:54.762
Stop!

34:54.763 --> 34:56.594
(Panting) Darby! Stop!

34:56.595 --> 34:58.266
Help! Help!

34:58.267 --> 35:00.398
This woman tried to
kidnap me! She's got a gun!

35:00.399 --> 35:01.729
Hold it right there. Hands up.

35:01.730 --> 35:03.431
I'm unarmed. I can explain.

35:03.432 --> 35:04.602
Tell me what happened.
She pulled a gun on me

35:04.603 --> 35:05.574
when I was walking
home from school

35:05.575 --> 35:06.704
and told me to get into her car.

35:06.705 --> 35:08.476
She was gonna kill me!

35:08.477 --> 35:10.638
She's lying! She's a suspect
in a murder case. (Crying)

35:10.639 --> 35:12.610
She should be in
custody. Who are you?

35:12.611 --> 35:14.282
I'm Dr. Megan hunt.
I'm a medical examiner.

35:14.283 --> 35:15.583
I am with the city.

35:15.584 --> 35:17.145
See? She's totally crazy!

35:17.146 --> 35:18.316
Do you have credentials?

35:18.317 --> 35:20.548
Yes, I do. They're in my car...

35:20.549 --> 35:22.590
A city vehicle
around the corner.

35:22.591 --> 35:24.492
No! Watch out!

35:24.493 --> 35:26.225
Ohh!

35:27.756 --> 35:30.159
Don't you dare move.

35:44.573 --> 35:46.615
You must think
you're pretty clever.

35:48.817 --> 35:50.778
Oh, this is funny to you?

35:50.779 --> 35:52.820
What if it is?

35:52.821 --> 35:54.151
You killed two people,

35:54.152 --> 35:55.783
put a cop in the hospital.

35:55.784 --> 35:57.285
I don't think that's very funny.

35:57.286 --> 35:58.786
You have no
proof I did anything.

35:58.787 --> 36:00.488
Well, we got the
ibuprofen ointment.

36:00.489 --> 36:01.829
Well, that's weak.

36:01.830 --> 36:03.761
I'm pretty sure I'm not the
only patient who used it.

36:03.762 --> 36:06.195
Thought you might say that.

36:08.637 --> 36:10.198
Thanks.

36:10.199 --> 36:12.370
(People speak indistinctly)

36:12.371 --> 36:14.302
The murder weapon...

36:14.303 --> 36:15.744
A ball peen hammer.

36:16.945 --> 36:18.806
Where did you find that?

36:18.807 --> 36:20.808
Had a hunch it was in
one of the heating vents.

36:20.809 --> 36:22.810
First one I checked
was in the showers.

36:22.811 --> 36:24.482
I got lucky.

36:24.483 --> 36:25.783
It's got Renee's
blood on the head

36:25.784 --> 36:27.785
and your skin
cells on the handle.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.186
We got you, darby.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.618
Whatever.

36:30.619 --> 36:32.660
Why'd you kill your sister?

36:32.661 --> 36:34.223
(Scoffs)

36:36.825 --> 36:38.866
Beth was a whiny brat.

36:38.867 --> 36:40.598
Trust me. I did the
world a big favor.

36:40.599 --> 36:41.829
(Megan) And you
ruined your mother's life.

36:41.830 --> 36:43.831
Yeah? Well, she
tried to ruin mine

36:43.832 --> 36:45.633
by throwing me
into that freak zoo.

36:45.634 --> 36:46.804
She was trying to get you help.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.536
Mom was never gonna
let me out of there.

36:48.537 --> 36:50.238
So I had to do it myself.

36:50.239 --> 36:51.409
That's why you murdered Renee,

36:51.410 --> 36:52.840
to lure us into the institution?

36:52.841 --> 36:55.483
So you could tell us
your sad little story.

36:55.484 --> 36:58.946
(Scoffs) All I had to do was
find someone to believe it.

36:58.947 --> 37:00.888
I chose you.

37:00.889 --> 37:03.421
Your mother's right.

37:03.422 --> 37:05.222
You're a sick little girl.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.894
And your daughter was right.

37:06.895 --> 37:08.426
You act all tough, but...

37:08.427 --> 37:11.360
You really just
want to help people.

37:12.901 --> 37:15.704
It was so easy to make
you feel sorry for me.

37:18.407 --> 37:21.669
Now I feel nothing for you.

37:21.670 --> 37:24.813
And you're going
away for a long time.

37:27.416 --> 37:29.947
We'll just have
to see about that,

37:29.948 --> 37:31.820
won't we?

37:43.732 --> 37:45.733
I know that you...

37:45.734 --> 37:47.895
Judge me for protecting darby.

37:47.896 --> 37:51.999
She was so sweet
one moment, and then...

37:52.000 --> 37:55.343
So cold the next.

37:55.344 --> 37:58.376
And I kept telling myself
that it was just a phase,

37:58.377 --> 38:00.548
that darby was still
my sweet little girl.

38:00.549 --> 38:02.810
But then after what
she did to Beth,

38:02.811 --> 38:06.314
I blamed myself for
not seeing the signs

38:06.315 --> 38:09.787
and for not getting
her help sooner.

38:09.788 --> 38:15.523
But I also wanted
to believe that...

38:15.524 --> 38:17.995
She could still be saved.

38:17.996 --> 38:20.798
And that's why I sent
her to Dr. Malcolm.

38:20.799 --> 38:24.432
I don't blame you.

38:24.433 --> 38:26.774
I can't.

38:26.775 --> 38:29.877
(Exhales) I wanted
to believe her

38:29.878 --> 38:31.740
as well.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.514
Did you come here to gloat?

38:36.515 --> 38:39.517
No, no, I came to apologize.

38:39.518 --> 38:41.719
I was, uh, wrong
about darby, too.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.792
Uh, obviously, she's
a total sociopath.

38:44.793 --> 38:46.854
I knew she was lying to you,

38:46.855 --> 38:48.896
but I-I didn't think she
was capable of murder.

38:48.897 --> 38:52.900
I wanted to tell you that.

38:52.901 --> 38:54.863
Thank you.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.339
Um... (Sighs)

39:02.941 --> 39:05.413
You know, i-I've
always thought of myself

39:05.414 --> 39:07.745
as a woman of science.

39:07.746 --> 39:09.647
And when the cops,

39:09.648 --> 39:12.780
they talk about gut instincts,

39:12.781 --> 39:15.483
it just makes me
think of intestines.

39:15.484 --> 39:16.785
It's messy.

39:18.727 --> 39:22.530
I let myself get messy.

39:22.531 --> 39:25.633
People are messy.

39:25.634 --> 39:27.695
We're no different.

39:27.696 --> 39:29.868
Mm.

39:41.850 --> 39:43.881
Hey.

39:43.882 --> 39:47.114
(Sighs)

39:47.115 --> 39:50.688
She found my weak spot, Tommy...

39:50.689 --> 39:53.862
A little girl who
nobody will listen to.

39:55.624 --> 39:58.497
She used it against me.
I should've known better.

39:59.898 --> 40:02.900
You're human,
like the rest of us.

40:02.901 --> 40:06.534
Yeah? Well, I don't like it.

40:06.535 --> 40:07.835
You can't always be right.

40:07.836 --> 40:09.777
I have to. It's my job.

40:09.778 --> 40:11.078
And if I'm wrong about her,

40:11.079 --> 40:13.541
then what else am I wrong about?

40:13.542 --> 40:15.543
My father?

40:15.544 --> 40:17.885
(Voice breaking) Am I
being cruel to my mother

40:17.886 --> 40:19.817
because I'm not seeing the truth

40:19.818 --> 40:22.089
that's right in front of me?

40:22.090 --> 40:25.753
Megan, you're being
pretty hard on yourself.

40:25.754 --> 40:28.956
You're better at your
job than anybody I know.

40:28.957 --> 40:30.728
(Scoffs)

40:30.729 --> 40:33.060
Come on. Let's go get a drink.

40:33.061 --> 40:36.033
(Sighs) I don't think so.

40:36.034 --> 40:39.767
Okay.

40:39.768 --> 40:41.769
(Sighs) All right,
you know what?

40:41.770 --> 40:44.842
I didn't want to
say anything, but...

40:44.843 --> 40:46.544
I talked to Riley.

40:46.545 --> 40:49.446
She told me about your date.

40:49.447 --> 40:50.778
(Inhales deeply)

40:50.779 --> 40:53.450
Mm. Our date.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.122
We went to a hockey game.

40:55.123 --> 40:56.654
You lied to me.

40:56.655 --> 40:59.026
You said there was nothing
going on between you two.

40:59.027 --> 41:00.828
You see what you're
doing, don't you?

41:00.829 --> 41:02.530
I mean, this isn't about Riley.

41:02.531 --> 41:04.061
This is about...

41:04.062 --> 41:06.033
You're trying to find
any excuse you can

41:06.034 --> 41:07.495
to push me away

41:07.496 --> 41:09.897
because you know that
we would actually be happy,

41:09.898 --> 41:12.240
and that idea
just terrifies you.

41:22.010 --> 41:26.484
I think that we should
put the past... to rest.

41:30.158 --> 41:31.719
Megan...

41:31.720 --> 41:34.762
It's for the best.

41:34.763 --> 41:37.025
(Sighs)

41:38.797 --> 41:41.269
Good night, Tommy.
