00:00.066 --> 00:01.442
Previously on Ghost Whisperer

00:01.454 --> 00:02.685
The day of the accident,

00:02.723 --> 00:05.014
I saw Jim's ghost step into Sam's body

00:06.454 --> 00:08.240
- You're back.  - Do I know you?

00:08.491 --> 00:10.275
I see the same guy that you see...

00:10.312 --> 00:11.195
It's not Jim.

00:11.214 --> 00:13.503
I just know what I see when I look into those eyes.

00:13.511 --> 00:15.265
And Jim is in there somewhere.

00:15.303 --> 00:16.344
Wait. You're not gonna tell me

00:16.344 --> 00:17.985
you think I'm your husband reincarnated.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.224
I see ghosts.

00:20.234 --> 00:22.800
Because this thing that I do, it's a really big part of me.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.466
And if you don't believe in it, I...

00:25.673 --> 00:27.523
Hey, you needed a little time,you needed a little space.

00:27.643 --> 00:29.072
To get ready to tell me this.

00:29.461 --> 00:30.930
Take all the time you need.

00:36.767 --> 00:38.910
No,no,no. It's easy.

00:39.130 --> 00:41.930
OK? I walk you through it. Do you see the light?

00:43.811 --> 00:44.347
No?

00:45.464 --> 00:46.788
All right, we'll try it again.

00:48.710 --> 00:51.198
OK, great. So you do see the light. OK.

00:51.417 --> 00:53.820
So now just press the start key.

00:53.940 --> 00:55.290
And enter the code.

00:56.518 --> 00:57.382
OK.

00:58.803 --> 01:00.670
Great. All right. I'll see you later, bye.

01:01.434 --> 01:02.871
- Morning.  - Sorry.

01:03.607 --> 01:06.302
Delia is having some trouble with our security system.

01:07.094 --> 01:08.130
That's good.

01:12.087 --> 01:14.387
- You thought that I...  - Into the light,you know?

01:14.760 --> 01:16.570
Well, to be fair,

01:16.570 --> 01:18.380
It looks similar only minus the ear piece.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.305
Do you mind...I really need some coffee now.

01:20.443 --> 01:22.360
No, it's fine. Help yourself.

01:24.252 --> 01:27.343
Look, I know that this is hard to wrap your head around.

01:28.105 --> 01:30.340
But I want to be an open book with you.

01:30.760 --> 01:32.731
Especially with you.

01:33.730 --> 01:34.553
OK,

01:35.069 --> 01:37.530
Well,that's good. Because I've got a lot of questions.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.490
Well, I have some answers.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.037
All right,so this is what it looks like. Right?

01:43.075 --> 01:44.549
When you talk to them.

01:44.886 --> 01:46.816
And how they...wait a minute. First of all.

01:46.816 --> 01:48.746
Are there any of them around here right now?

01:48.992 --> 01:51.311
No. But they do visit me here.

01:51.339 --> 01:53.471
I mean, some because they need my help.

01:53.489 --> 01:55.400
And they know that I have a gift.

01:55.520 --> 01:58.509
And others just pop up when you are least expected.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.050
And you just talk to them.

02:00.210 --> 02:02.740
Yeah, I help them figure out why they still earth-bound,you know.

02:02.930 --> 02:04.251
Get them into light.

02:04.371 --> 02:05.819
Any light does the same thing?

02:06.347 --> 02:07.962
In its own way. Yeah.

02:10.065 --> 02:11.533
A part of the day's work, I guess.

02:11.653 --> 02:12.566
It's not every day.

02:12.686 --> 02:15.972
It's just...when they do show up,I feel like it's my job to help.

02:17.643 --> 02:18.413
Right.

02:19.750 --> 02:20.986
Melinda, I wanna believe you.

02:21.106 --> 02:23.117
A, because I'm crazy about you,

02:23.155 --> 02:26.480
But B because it's just so amazing.

02:29.436 --> 02:31.028
Look, I'm off today, and I just...

02:31.028 --> 02:32.620
I wanna go down and check on the jobsite.

02:32.656 --> 02:35.239
But can I come back and just hang out with you and...

02:36.269 --> 02:38.280
Watch you do what you do?

02:39.767 --> 02:40.970
Bad idea. What's wrong?

02:41.090 --> 02:41.932
No.

02:43.624 --> 02:47.314
No, it's just this is more than...what I do.

02:47.382 --> 02:48.460
It's who I am.

02:48.580 --> 02:51.779
No ghost jokes, I promise. Cross my heart not to die.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074

03:04.634 --> 03:05.567
Nope.

03:05.634 --> 03:07.467
Not a ghost in sight.

03:08.467 --> 03:09.901
Now, wait a minute. What about, uh...

03:09.967 --> 03:12.400
What about when the lights went off in the hardware store?

03:12.467 --> 03:13.600
Power failure.

03:13.667 --> 03:15.501
Oh, and those boxes that fell at the post office...

03:15.568 --> 03:16.634
- Just gravity.  - Yep.

03:16.900 --> 03:19.167
I gotta say, I'm a little disappointed so far.

03:19.234 --> 03:20.167
Are you kidding?

03:20.234 --> 03:22.434
A day without ghosts is like a vacation.

03:22.450 --> 03:25.367
I mean, it is nice to be able to run errands without being harassed,

03:25.434 --> 03:26.834
Although the day is young.

03:26.901 --> 03:28.634
Hmm. All right, whatever you say.

03:28.701 --> 03:31.501
Look, I gotta run in here and grab a check from my boss.

03:31.567 --> 03:33.534
He's, uh, redeveloping this whole place as a school,

03:33.600 --> 03:34.701
grade by grade.

03:34.768 --> 03:35.933
Cool.

03:39.367 --> 03:41.868
Oh, wow. Cute kids.

03:43.567 --> 03:45.467
I do remember liking them.

04:04.067 --> 04:05.868
What is it?

04:07.400 --> 04:09.034
You look like you've seen a ghost.

04:09.101 --> 04:11.433
3, actually. There's...

04:11.500 --> 04:14.334
There's one by the tree, one on the merry-go-round, and...

04:16.666 --> 04:18.000
One on the swing.

04:20.634 --> 04:21.901
Really?

04:21.966 --> 04:24.134
What was this place before you guys renovated it?

04:24.200 --> 04:26.534
Some kind of clinic, I think.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.233
Ok, everybody, let's line up.

04:28.300 --> 04:30.001
Snack time.

04:34.000 --> 04:34.734
What?

04:34.801 --> 04:37.233
I think some of the patients are still here.

05:21.067 --> 05:22.701
Ok, so prior to last year,

05:22.768 --> 05:24.801
Parkdale Academy was Providence Care Clinic,

05:24.867 --> 05:26.900
Established 1962, and prior to that...

05:27.607 --> 05:30.374
It was the Valley Springs Sanatorium.

05:30.441 --> 05:33.273
A mental hospital, which would explain the ghosts I saw.

05:33.340 --> 05:35.340
I know exactly what you're thinking.

05:35.407 --> 05:36.974
Maybe this was something she already knew

05:36.991 --> 05:40.707
Or something she once heard and then she just forgot.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.273
You had your doubts, too?

05:44.707 --> 05:45.640
Ah, big doubts.

05:45.707 --> 05:48.407
Well, what finally convinced you?

05:49.874 --> 05:54.208
I just saw all the people that she helped,

05:54.273 --> 05:58.340
You know, most of which didn't even believe her either at first, so...

05:59.208 --> 06:01.474
Ok. There are ghosts.

06:01.540 --> 06:03.273
But how can they be threatening?

06:03.340 --> 06:05.273
Uh, it depends. I mean,

06:05.340 --> 06:06.974
Sometimes the ghosts can be benign.

06:06.991 --> 06:09.191
Other times, they're a complete nuisance,

06:09.258 --> 06:12.524
And then the really troubled ones, they can be dangerous.

06:12.590 --> 06:13.957
How so?

06:14.024 --> 06:15.857
Well, in this case, for example,

06:15.924 --> 06:17.758
You're dealing with children under the age of 10,

06:17.823 --> 06:21.090
so they could be influenced by them, 'cause kids that age,

06:21.157 --> 06:23.857
They can see and talk to ghosts.

06:23.924 --> 06:25.291
We grow up, and it goes away,

06:25.357 --> 06:27.791
There's no room in the rational adult brain.

06:27.857 --> 06:30.390
Well, I have no memory of ever seeing ghosts.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.924
Which, in my case, would make that completely meaningless, so...

06:34.991 --> 06:36.190
Now that their home has been turned into a school,

06:36.257 --> 06:39.891
The ghosts could scare the children or even worse.

06:39.957 --> 06:41.757
And that's where you come in.

06:42.490 --> 06:43.524
What's your next step?

06:43.791 --> 06:45.290
Well, I have to talk to them,

06:45.357 --> 06:47.190
You know, figure out what's keeping them here,

06:47.257 --> 06:49.024
And then hopefully get them into the light.

06:49.490 --> 06:50.423
Yeah, but it's a kindergarten.

06:50.490 --> 06:52.790
I mean, they're not gonna let you in and let you say,

06:52.857 --> 06:54.157
"hey, I wanna talk to ghosts."

06:54.224 --> 06:55.224
How are you gonna do that?

06:55.291 --> 06:57.191
I think you mean "we."

06:58.590 --> 07:00.523
Not at all. We're delighted.

07:00.590 --> 07:02.057
I mean, all this time you were working here,

07:02.124 --> 07:03.757
And you never once mentioned you had a child.

07:03.824 --> 07:04.824
Well, we don't.

07:04.891 --> 07:06.224
Wait. Not yet.

07:06.891 --> 07:08.490
When is your due date?

07:08.557 --> 07:10.424
Oh, look. Not pregnant. Nope.

07:10.457 --> 07:12.224
Right. We're just planning ahead.

07:12.591 --> 07:14.583
Oh. Way, way ahead.

07:14.590 --> 07:16.391
'Cause, you know, we don't even know if we wanna stay here or...

07:16.457 --> 07:17.790
- Move to the city.  - Right.

07:17.857 --> 07:20.557
And if we do stay here, you know, what are the best schools?

07:21.524 --> 07:22.891
It just seems a little crazy, huh?

07:22.957 --> 07:24.690
No, not at all. It's smart.

07:24.757 --> 07:26.991
I wish more parents had your foresight.

07:27.058 --> 07:28.191
So, how long have you been married?

07:28.457 --> 07:29.991
- W-we're not yet.  - 6 months.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.826
He means that we're getting married...

07:31.892 --> 07:33.358
In 6 months.

07:33.725 --> 07:35.826
- Well, congratulations.  - Thank you.

07:35.893 --> 07:37.459
Well, let me finish showing you around,

07:37.526 --> 07:39.509
And then we'll stop by the admissions office

07:39.509 --> 07:41.092
and pick up a brochure.

07:41.159 --> 07:42.092
Thanks.

07:50.159 --> 07:51.092
Oh, hello.

07:51.359 --> 07:53.125
Penny, this is Sam and Melinda.

07:53.192 --> 07:54.826
They're checking out the academy.

07:54.893 --> 07:55.893
Hi. Nice to meet you.

07:56.129 --> 07:58.262
Well, we're all very proud of the school.

08:00.895 --> 08:03.262
Did they learn that beautiful French phonetically?

08:03.329 --> 08:04.462
I didn't teach them.

08:04.529 --> 08:05.800
They must have learned it in music class.

08:05.800 --> 08:10.300
I thought Jane was teaching them rhythm with sign language.

08:18.096 --> 08:20.129
You think a ghost taught the kids that song?

08:20.195 --> 08:21.495
Well, you heard it for yourself.

08:21.562 --> 08:22.829
It wasn't one of the teachers.

08:22.896 --> 08:24.429
Well, there's gotta be a logical explanation.

08:24.495 --> 08:26.129
One of the kids learned it and then taught the others.

08:26.196 --> 08:27.495
Yeah, I would think the same thing, too,

08:27.562 --> 08:28.895
If I hadn't seen the ghost for myself.

08:29.162 --> 08:31.000
Well, wait. Since you didn't talk to her...

08:31.000 --> 08:33.062
It...them, what do you do now?

08:33.129 --> 08:34.029
We go and see Eli.

08:34.096 --> 08:35.162
'Cause he can hear ghosts?

08:35.328 --> 08:36.996
No, because the ghosts were mental patients,

08:37.063 --> 08:38.662
And he's a shrink.

08:40.261 --> 08:42.196
All the files from the valley springs sanatorium,

08:42.261 --> 08:43.794
They were donated to the psych department

08:43.861 --> 08:45.429
When the place shut down in '61.

08:45.495 --> 08:48.329
You're telling me you got all the files for this place here?

08:48.396 --> 08:50.029
Of all the things you need to digest,

08:50.096 --> 08:51.562
I'm thinking that's the least strange.

08:51.828 --> 08:53.429
Right.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.396
Yeah. That's her.

08:58.462 --> 09:00.929
I pulled pictures of women who fit the description.

09:00.995 --> 09:03.429
Greer Clarkson. Is that the ghost that you saw?

09:03.496 --> 09:04.596
Well, according to her file,

09:04.663 --> 09:05.828
She was committed shortly after giving birth.

09:05.895 --> 09:08.496
She said that she was having dark thoughts.

09:08.563 --> 09:10.262
Sounds like P.P.D., postpartum depression,

09:10.329 --> 09:13.029
Which wasn't exactly taken seriously in the fifties.

09:13.095 --> 09:15.995
It also says here that she was delusional, that she heard voices.

09:16.662 --> 09:19.462
Ok, she died in the asylum in '59,

09:19.529 --> 09:20.562
But the cause of death isn't listed.

09:20.629 --> 09:22.629
You think the hospital might have had something to hide?

09:22.696 --> 09:25.896
Well, it's possible. Maybe that's what's keeping her earthbound.

09:26.962 --> 09:29.129
Or this. Oh, my god.

09:29.195 --> 09:31.129
What? What is it?

09:32.195 --> 09:33.729
It's a therapy journal.

09:33.796 --> 09:37.162
She writes about how she drowned her baby.

09:37.229 --> 09:40.229
God, who would do that?

09:40.295 --> 09:42.362
Someone with postpartum psychosis.

09:42.429 --> 09:44.462
And now she's surrounded by children,

09:44.529 --> 09:46.496
Living children.

09:47.329 --> 09:49.495
Ok, let's all quiet down.

09:49.562 --> 09:51.763
We're gonna get in line for a play break.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.529
Children.

10:02.896 --> 10:03.829
Todd.

10:07.396 --> 10:09.462
What are you...

10:18.462 --> 10:20.229
Ok, sweetie. Go sit down.

10:31.462 --> 10:32.529
Rosalyn.

10:32.596 --> 10:34.429
I think we need to call Todd Langston's parents.

10:34.495 --> 10:35.929
He's just done the strangest thing.

10:35.996 --> 10:37.195
- Is he ok?  - I don't know.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.095
And I'm gonna need help getting permanent marker

10:39.162 --> 10:40.029
Off the dry-erase board.

10:40.095 --> 10:41.395
You won't believe what he wrote.

10:41.462 --> 10:43.362
I didn't even know he could write.

10:46.429 --> 10:47.596
Oh, my god.

10:49.462 --> 10:51.429
They were all just right here.

10:51.495 --> 10:54.362
Then where did they go?

10:57.262 --> 10:58.429
The ghost you saw, you're sure

10:58.496 --> 10:59.529
She wants to harm the kids?

10:59.596 --> 11:00.496
No, but it's possible.

11:00.562 --> 11:01.796
And you're sure it's that lady,

11:01.863 --> 11:03.895
The...the one who killed her kid?

11:03.912 --> 11:06.012
I could see her face as clearly as I see yours.

11:06.079 --> 11:07.835
And you're gonna go into this place and tell the people who run...

11:07.846 --> 11:09.479
As little as possible, ok?

11:09.546 --> 11:11.612
I know how this sounds to people,

11:11.779 --> 11:14.312
And I don't know. I try to keep what I can do quiet.

11:14.379 --> 11:15.712
Oh, no.

11:16.745 --> 11:18.779
Jill. Hey, what's happening?

11:18.846 --> 11:19.712
Hey, Melinda.

11:19.779 --> 11:21.345
You don't have anyone here, do you?

11:21.412 --> 11:22.546
No, no, no, no. We're just passing by.

11:22.712 --> 11:24.013
- This is Sam Lucas.  - Officer.

11:25.078 --> 11:26.078
It's unbelievable.

11:26.145 --> 11:27.913
I don't know who's running the school.

11:27.979 --> 11:29.879
There's a whole kindergarten class missing.

11:29.946 --> 11:32.279
You know, um, Sam, he worked in this building,

11:32.346 --> 11:33.879
So maybe he could help you.

11:33.945 --> 11:34.879
Uh, sure.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.612
Um, I need to try to find this ghost.

11:36.679 --> 11:39.012
- I'll meet you in there.  - All right. Yeah.

11:45.379 --> 11:47.946
How could a 5-year-old have written this?

11:48.013 --> 11:50.278
How could 14 students leave the premises

11:50.345 --> 11:53.112
Without a single adult or security camera capturing their exit?

11:53.279 --> 11:54.700
And only one way out.

11:54.700 --> 11:57.434
Unit 6, please respond to village square, main and oak.

11:57.501 --> 11:59.768
We've located those missing juveniles from Parkdale Academy.

11:59.834 --> 12:00.768
Copy that.

12:00.834 --> 12:03.300
How the hell did they get there?

12:22.334 --> 12:23.401
Jennifer

12:24.134 --> 12:25.700
Todd, what happened, come here!

12:26.867 --> 12:28.134
Come here.

12:29.468 --> 12:30.734
Todd you scared me.

12:30.767 --> 12:32.200
How did you get here?

12:32.334 --> 12:33.468
We have to finish this song.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.634
If we don't sing, she gets so sad.

12:36.701 --> 12:38.197
Honey who?

12:39.300 --> 12:40.968
Where are they taking them?

12:41.434 --> 12:44.900
Home, I'm sure. Did you do this?

12:44.967 --> 12:46.500
Did you lead these children away?

12:46.567 --> 12:49.667
Uh, I'm not exactly sure what's happening right here.

12:49.734 --> 12:51.867
Sorry. I'm just gonna pretend like I'm talking to you,

12:51.934 --> 12:52.900
So keep looking at me.

12:53.067 --> 12:54.401
All right.

12:55.168 --> 12:56.268
I can help you.

12:57.368 --> 12:59.268
But please don't hurt those children.

12:59.334 --> 13:01.167
I don't want to.

13:02.533 --> 13:05.000
Done such a terrible thing.

13:05.067 --> 13:06.200
But you don't have to do this.

13:06.267 --> 13:07.934
You can just let the children be.

13:08.001 --> 13:09.634
They want to be with me.

13:09.701 --> 13:10.901
They heard me singing.

13:10.967 --> 13:12.301
They don't belong to you.

13:12.368 --> 13:13.367
You're dead.

13:13.434 --> 13:15.168
Ok, this place is a school now.

13:15.233 --> 13:17.334
They belong with the living. Just nod.

13:17.401 --> 13:20.001
They need to be quieter.

13:20.067 --> 13:22.167
Is that why you wrote that on the blackboard?

13:23.267 --> 13:24.500
"I'll be quiet when I'm dead."

13:24.567 --> 13:25.767
Were you threatening them?

13:30.567 --> 13:31.767
Keep them away.

13:31.834 --> 13:33.901
They mustn't come back.

13:35.034 --> 13:36.901
It's not safe.

13:39.134 --> 13:40.368
She's gone.

13:45.368 --> 13:46.368
I'll get the car ready.

13:47.167 --> 13:50.501
Keep them away from what, the school or from her?

13:50.568 --> 13:52.034
I don't know. I'm just glad that

13:52.100 --> 13:53.567
the place is closed down for a few days.

13:53.634 --> 13:55.868
You know, maybe there is a...a bad teacher

13:55.934 --> 13:57.567
Or...or something at the school itself.

13:57.633 --> 13:59.500
Like what, a toxic mold?

13:59.667 --> 14:01.034
The woman killed her own baby.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.800
She suffered from postpartum psychosis.

14:02.867 --> 14:04.134
I'm just considering our options.

14:04.201 --> 14:05.867
I mean, we know who she is.

14:05.934 --> 14:07.634
We have no idea what she wants,

14:07.700 --> 14:09.634
And all we know is that she seemed,

14:09.700 --> 14:11.768
You know, genuinely concerned about those kids.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.867
Then why did she keep kidnapping them

14:13.933 --> 14:15.500
And writing death threats on their board?

14:15.567 --> 14:17.801
Ok, she did not write that. A boy did.

14:17.867 --> 14:19.767
Oh, when he was 5? Did she possess him?

14:19.834 --> 14:22.334
Or maybe it was automatic writing.

14:22.901 --> 14:24.367
Wh-what kind of writing?

14:24.434 --> 14:25.867
Automatic writing... channeling a spirit

14:25.933 --> 14:28.468
Without being completely taken over by it.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.000
You mean versus possession.

14:30.367 --> 14:31.568
Yeah.

14:31.633 --> 14:34.867
You know, it's kind of like if you can believe

14:34.934 --> 14:38.634
That a... a spirit can exist outside a body...

14:38.701 --> 14:42.867
Then is it such a stretch to think it could push into another body?

14:46.733 --> 14:48.167
How are you doin'?

14:49.300 --> 14:51.568
You know, all right, I'm here to learn. I'm here to support.

14:51.633 --> 14:53.700
I don't wanna get in the way of you guys solving this.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.468
Ok, good, because we have to figure out

14:55.534 --> 14:57.468
How she got those kids out of the school

14:57.534 --> 14:59.334
And stop it from happening again,

14:59.401 --> 15:01.001
Which means we have to go back there.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.967
So,what? We're looking for another way to leave the building?

15:04.034 --> 15:06.333
But there was only one exit to the building.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.333
Uh, for the grounds.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.234
Where else would an exit go?

15:11.168 --> 15:12.834
To the tunnels.

15:13.667 --> 15:15.101
The...the what?

15:15.267 --> 15:17.634
I can't believe I'm gonna have to tell you this.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.434
Underneath Grandview, there's a series of tunnels,

15:19.501 --> 15:21.067
a town under the town.

15:21.134 --> 15:23.001
And a lot of people died there.

15:23.067 --> 15:25.433
They still think it's their home,

15:25.500 --> 15:26.800
If you catch my drift.

15:26.867 --> 15:28.401
Uh, you found this?

15:28.667 --> 15:31.333
No. The only person that's been down there is Melinda.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.434
I'm sorry. I can't have your back on this one.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.800
I'm scared of small spaces.

15:37.401 --> 15:38.634
I'm not.

15:43.434 --> 15:45.967
Good job getting past the security guard.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.167
Sam.

16:02.291 --> 16:03.924
Looks like another door. What the?

16:03.991 --> 16:05.457
Do you think the kids found this?

16:05.724 --> 16:07.224
Yeah, or were led to it.

16:07.290 --> 16:08.690
Hang on.

16:25.057 --> 16:27.391
I don't remember that door being spring-loaded.

16:27.457 --> 16:30.823
Yeah, that's 'cause it wasn't.

16:46.790 --> 16:47.890
What is it?

16:54.257 --> 16:56.591
What's going on?

17:09.457 --> 17:12.290
Sing your little song, Greer, if it calms you.

17:12.357 --> 17:14.023
Doesn't bother me a bit.

17:14.089 --> 17:17.089
Soothe yourself, as you soothed your child,

17:17.156 --> 17:19.191
And say good-bye to him now,

17:19.257 --> 17:22.857
To all the bad memories, all the thoughts.

17:22.924 --> 17:24.890
Let it all go.

17:27.391 --> 17:28.358
What?

17:28.424 --> 17:29.590
Melinda.

17:31.991 --> 17:33.490
She needs more.

17:34.358 --> 17:35.823
Wait, Melinda, what's going on?

17:35.890 --> 17:37.090
Stop!

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
Melinda, Melinda, hey.

17:56.634 --> 17:58.367
- Are you ok?  - Yeah.

18:03.867 --> 18:06.834
- Sometimes I get... I get visions. - What?

18:06.900 --> 18:09.533
It's like I was Greer, and now I know.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.400
You know what?

18:12.034 --> 18:13.633
How she died.

18:18.700 --> 18:20.099
Sam pretty much has reached his limit.

18:20.166 --> 18:22.899
I mean, mental patients haunting children and then possessions,

18:22.966 --> 18:24.932
And, oh, yeah, let's not forget the tunnels.

18:24.999 --> 18:26.932
That's a lot to swallow.

18:27.599 --> 18:28.599
Make sense, though.

18:28.666 --> 18:30.766
The courthouse is right in the town square.

18:30.773 --> 18:32.739
The tunnels let them transport the criminally insane.

18:32.806 --> 18:34.172
Yeah, so that people couldn't see them.

18:34.439 --> 18:35.372
But electroshock therapy?

18:35.439 --> 18:37.172
I mean, how did they get away with that?

18:37.239 --> 18:39.872
Well,in the fifties,it was still kind of an experimental treatment.

18:39.939 --> 18:41.605
You know, patients had different reactions,

18:41.672 --> 18:44.240
And hospitals weren't exactly advertising their fatalities.

18:44.306 --> 18:46.273
It was so sad. She was just trying to calm herself,

18:46.339 --> 18:47.755
You know, and she kept singing that song.

18:47.772 --> 18:49.239
- Alouette. - Yeah.

18:49.306 --> 18:50.739
You know what that song even means?

18:51.105 --> 18:53.406
It's a bunch of french words that nobody understands.

18:53.473 --> 18:54.640
It's about a bird,

18:54.706 --> 18:56.506
And the refrain means to "pluck your head."

18:56.573 --> 18:58.172
That's disgusting.

18:58.239 --> 18:59.673
No, it's insulting...

18:59.740 --> 19:01.006
To psychiatry...

19:01.072 --> 19:02.006
To me.

19:02.072 --> 19:04.306
To pluck your head. Get it?

19:04.373 --> 19:06.506
All right, fine, so it's not exactly subtle,

19:06.572 --> 19:08.239
But why do you think she'd be taking a swipe at her doctors?

19:08.305 --> 19:10.439
Not doctors, doctor.

19:10.506 --> 19:13.406
The one that she keeps mentioning in all of her therapy journals

19:13.473 --> 19:15.572
Is this Dr. Byrd, a Calvin Byrd.

19:15.639 --> 19:18.006
So that's the guy that I saw in my vision.

19:18.073 --> 19:21.073
If it is, he might have done more than oversee her final zap.

19:21.139 --> 19:23.439
He may have plucked her head, got inside of her mind.

19:23.445 --> 19:25.512
Yeah, but that still doesn't tell me what she wants.

19:25.579 --> 19:27.579
It would help to know what he found inside of her mind,

19:27.645 --> 19:31.012
Because if Greer's nuts, we'll never be able to reason with her,

19:31.039 --> 19:33.972
And you'll never be able to get her into the light.

19:38.172 --> 19:39.373
Hello.

19:39.439 --> 19:41.072
Hey. Hi. It's me.

19:41.139 --> 19:44.506
I know it's late, but, uh, can we talk?

19:44.573 --> 19:46.840
Are you home?

19:46.905 --> 19:48.939
I'm actually on your front porch.

19:49.005 --> 19:50.972
Well, then come in.

19:52.939 --> 19:56.272
Hey. I just didn't want to, uh, scare you.

19:56.339 --> 19:57.272
Right.

19:57.339 --> 19:59.840
Kind of like I scared you tonight.

19:59.905 --> 20:01.573
No, it's ok.

20:02.773 --> 20:05.272
I'm really... I'm ok if...

20:05.339 --> 20:06.439
If you are.

20:06.506 --> 20:07.373
I am.

20:07.439 --> 20:09.573
I'm ok.

20:11.005 --> 20:12.639
Are those bunny slippers?

20:12.706 --> 20:14.106
Sorry.

20:15.106 --> 20:18.005
Really wasn't expecting company.

20:18.072 --> 20:21.905
In fact, I thought I would never see you again.

20:25.072 --> 20:26.673
I live in your garage.

20:26.740 --> 20:28.506
You know what I mean.

20:30.272 --> 20:34.972
Melinda, this thing you went through in the school...

20:35.039 --> 20:35.973
The vision.

20:36.039 --> 20:37.873
Did it hurt? I mean, were you in any pain?

20:38.939 --> 20:40.973
It's kind of like a dream.

20:41.039 --> 20:44.706
But, you know, I mean, i-it feels real when it's happening,

20:44.772 --> 20:46.706
But it's also kind of removed.

20:46.772 --> 20:48.572
Just please...

20:48.639 --> 20:50.572
Don't worry about me.

20:51.806 --> 20:54.405
Have you ever met anybody who can do what you do?

20:54.472 --> 20:55.405
Besides Eli.

20:55.472 --> 20:57.939
Some, but not many.

20:59.273 --> 21:02.139
I just wish you could subcontract to them right now.

21:02.506 --> 21:03.772
You know...

21:06.240 --> 21:08.039
You could keep helping me.

21:11.340 --> 21:12.806
Ok.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.672
All right, where are we?

21:15.739 --> 21:20.106
We think that the ghost died as a result of electroshock therapy,

21:20.373 --> 21:22.672
But that doesn't explain what's keeping her earthbound.

21:22.739 --> 21:25.072
Eli thinks it's more about her treatment with this...

21:25.139 --> 21:27.139
This Dr. Byrd guy.

21:27.206 --> 21:29.640
Dr. Byrd. Ok. What does that have to do

21:29.706 --> 21:31.206
With her warnings about the children?

21:31.273 --> 21:32.273
I don't know.

21:32.339 --> 21:34.405
I mean, honestly I think what drives her

21:34.472 --> 21:38.539
Is her guilt about, you know, what she did to her child.

21:38.606 --> 21:42.072
I'm guessing it was too long ago for Dr. Byrd to give you any insight.

21:42.139 --> 21:43.139
Well, he looked like he was in his fifties,

21:43.206 --> 21:44.439
And that was 50 years ago, so...

21:44.505 --> 21:45.539
He's dead.

21:46.106 --> 21:47.272
How old was Greer?

21:47.339 --> 21:48.272
23.

21:52.239 --> 21:53.839
Her husband...

21:56.472 --> 21:59.706
Leighton. You know, I saw his name in the files,

21:59.873 --> 22:03.606
'cause he was the... he was the person that checked her in. I'm...

22:06.473 --> 22:09.772
Ok, there's a few Clarksons. Here.

22:10.506 --> 22:13.406
Leighton died in 2001.

22:13.473 --> 22:14.739
Wait a minute. What's that?

22:15.006 --> 22:17.039
It's a wedding announcement.

22:17.106 --> 22:20.206
"Douglas Clarkson, the son of Leighton and Greer Clarkson."

22:20.773 --> 22:21.773
Wait. She had another kid.

22:21.840 --> 22:22.873
No.

22:22.940 --> 22:25.406
Douglas was the name of the child she drowned.

22:25.473 --> 22:27.639
She was committed for killing her son...

22:29.506 --> 22:31.105
But he's alive.

22:36.972 --> 22:38.373
I never knew my mother.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.233
I was 2 1/2 when she died,

22:40.299 --> 22:42.700
So I don't really have any memories of her.

22:44.166 --> 22:47.499
I know she died in the hospital. I just don't know the cause.

22:47.566 --> 22:48.433
Hospital?

22:48.499 --> 22:50.765
That's a kind word.

22:50.832 --> 22:52.566
It was an asylum.

22:52.633 --> 22:54.999
She died of heart failure.

22:55.066 --> 22:57.132
Why wasn't it in the hospital's records?

22:57.199 --> 22:58.233
I don't know.

22:58.299 --> 23:01.032
They kept a lot of things hidden back then,

23:01.099 --> 23:02.799
My mother being one of them.

23:02.865 --> 23:04.566
You don't think she belonged there?

23:05.533 --> 23:07.600
My dad didn't know what else to do.

23:07.666 --> 23:09.333
One day, he's reading the newspaper,

23:09.399 --> 23:12.000
And she's giving me a bath in the kitchen sink,

23:12.000 --> 23:15.167
And she turns to him, tells him, "take the baby away,"

23:15.234 --> 23:18.867
And then she tells him she needs to be taken away.

23:19.633 --> 23:22.667
Do you know, according to her files,

23:22.733 --> 23:25.099
Says she actually drowned you.

23:25.100 --> 23:27.534
Obviously there was some confusion.

23:31.067 --> 23:33.868
By all accounts, before I was born,

23:33.934 --> 23:37.501
My mother was a loving,

23:37.567 --> 23:41.801
Smart, sane woman.

23:43.100 --> 23:45.834
You can't blame yourself for your mother's illness.

23:45.901 --> 23:48.400
"her dark thoughts,"

23:48.467 --> 23:51.367
That's what my dad said she called 'em.

23:51.434 --> 23:53.701
And she was afraid of hurting me,

23:53.707 --> 23:54.973
But she never did.

23:55.040 --> 23:57.441
Why was she in there for so long?

23:57.507 --> 23:58.808
She never recovered.

23:58.874 --> 24:01.240
She just got worse.

24:01.307 --> 24:03.340
Did you know that she got electroshock therapy?

24:06.574 --> 24:08.507
They said she requested it.

24:08.574 --> 24:09.808
She wanted to get better.

24:09.874 --> 24:12.174
But dad said she came out of the sessions

24:12.240 --> 24:14.274
Rambling worse than ever.

24:14.340 --> 24:16.607
Says in her files time and time again,

24:16.674 --> 24:18.607
Her sessions with a Dr. Byrd.

24:19.641 --> 24:21.974
Has your father ever mentioned him?

24:22.040 --> 24:23.441
No, not a word.

24:23.507 --> 24:25.773
And believe me, I heard him rant

24:25.840 --> 24:28.341
About every other soul in that place.

24:29.374 --> 24:31.407
So, who is this doctor?

24:31.474 --> 24:33.107
That's what I'm wondering.

24:33.874 --> 24:35.740
I did a search of records at the time,

24:35.807 --> 24:38.840
And there's no mention at the hospital of a Dr. Byrd

24:38.907 --> 24:40.074
Or with privileges.

24:40.141 --> 24:41.174
Well, how could that be?

24:41.241 --> 24:44.707
I don't know. Maybe he was a figment of her imagination.

24:44.774 --> 24:46.540
Think about it. The husband always visited her.

24:46.607 --> 24:47.707
He never knew him.

24:47.774 --> 24:50.640
I mean, she was gettin' enough shock therapy to kill her.

24:50.707 --> 24:53.540
Along the way, maybe she lost her rational mind

24:53.607 --> 24:55.607
Wait a minute.

24:55.674 --> 24:57.341
The rational mind.

24:59.274 --> 25:00.807
Ok...

25:00.874 --> 25:02.740
What else does shock therapy do?

25:02.807 --> 25:03.807
It calms people.

25:03.874 --> 25:06.041
It suppresses cognitive areas of the brain.

25:06.107 --> 25:09.041
Are you talking about the part of the brain

25:09.107 --> 25:13.241
That allows people to only believe what they can actually see and touch,

25:13.308 --> 25:15.107
Like the part I had way too much of?

25:15.974 --> 25:17.340
He's gotta be in here.

25:17.407 --> 25:20.607
There's gotta be a reason he's connected to the hospital.

25:21.741 --> 25:24.273
Well, did you check all these staff records,

25:24.340 --> 25:25.974
I mean, before Greer was admitted?

25:26.041 --> 25:29.407
I did, from 1950 to '59 and '40 to '49.

25:29.474 --> 25:31.807
We go back any further, I'm gonna be at Sigmund Freud.

25:31.874 --> 25:34.041
Well, keep goin',

25:34.108 --> 25:36.707
All the way back if you have to.

25:40.607 --> 25:43.007
Sorry to barge in, but your door was wide open.

25:43.074 --> 25:44.007
Always.

25:44.074 --> 25:47.707
You have to see what Eli and I found. Look.

25:48.807 --> 25:50.940
Well, that's him. That's Dr. Byrd.

25:50.997 --> 25:53.797
Yeah, but look what it says at the bottom.

25:53.864 --> 25:55.630
"Dr. Calvin byrd and staff,

25:55.697 --> 25:57.498
Valley springs sanatorium. April, 1922."

25:57.564 --> 26:00.763
Greer didn't even go into the asylum until 1956.

26:00.830 --> 26:03.164
Yeah, but this is the man I saw. He was a doctor there.

26:03.231 --> 26:05.464
Exactly, so he must have died not long after that,

26:05.531 --> 26:07.498
Stayed at the hospital, but out of the light.

26:07.564 --> 26:09.930
Eli says that shock therapy can rewire your brain,

26:10.197 --> 26:12.531
Take away that part that says ghosts don't make sense.

26:12.597 --> 26:14.764
What if she could see him

26:14.830 --> 26:16.230
And he got inside her head?

26:16.297 --> 26:18.031
And pluck it. He wasn't a delusion.

26:18.097 --> 26:20.830
So Greer's mind was being twisted by a ghost

26:20.897 --> 26:22.830
While she was still alive.

26:30.197 --> 26:31.997
Well, just to get it straight,

26:32.064 --> 26:33.697
This ghost that's haunting the kids,

26:33.763 --> 26:35.864
She was haunted herself by another ghost?

26:36.231 --> 26:37.463
Yeah, and based on her journals,

26:37.530 --> 26:39.463
We know it's when she was still alive.

26:39.530 --> 26:41.463
And this other ghost was the ghost of a doctor.

26:41.530 --> 26:43.730
That's why he was able to do so much damage.

26:43.797 --> 26:45.897
She trusted him, you know. He was an authority figure.

26:45.964 --> 26:46.897
A ghost?

26:46.964 --> 26:48.830
Yeah. He knew how to talk to her.

26:48.897 --> 26:50.530
I mean, he was probably the one

26:50.597 --> 26:52.730
Who convinced her that she killed her own child.

26:52.797 --> 26:55.264
Her ability to do this, I mean, talk to ghosts,

26:55.330 --> 26:56.830
Was from electroshock therapy.

26:56.897 --> 26:58.597
That's my best guess so far.

26:58.664 --> 27:00.064
Why's he doing this at all?

27:00.131 --> 27:01.964
I mean, I thought you said ghosts only haunt

27:02.031 --> 27:03.398
Things that they know, people they know.

27:03.463 --> 27:04.898
I don't know. He was a doctor, you know.

27:04.964 --> 27:06.730
Maybe he had a... a god complex,

27:06.797 --> 27:08.298
Or maybe they were connected in some way

27:08.364 --> 27:09.597
That we don't even know about yet.

27:09.664 --> 27:12.031
At least I'm not the only one who's in the dark.

27:12.097 --> 27:13.364
I have to get in there, ok?

27:13.430 --> 27:15.097
I need to find out what she's protecting those kids from.

27:15.164 --> 27:17.298
It's saturday. It's closed.

27:17.364 --> 27:18.764
There's no one...

27:20.197 --> 27:22.430
Here to let us in.

27:22.497 --> 27:25.131
- You'd just break in there, wouldn't you? - Yeah.

27:25.197 --> 27:26.830
I got a key from the contractor.

27:26.897 --> 27:28.563
Let's go.

27:28.630 --> 27:30.164
Wait. Where are we going?

27:30.231 --> 27:32.630
I mean, can't you just yell out the ghost's name?

27:32.647 --> 27:33.564
I don't think that's a good idea.

27:33.631 --> 27:36.497
She keeps giving warnings to people about being quiet.

27:36.563 --> 27:38.897
Why? Can ghosts sleep?

27:38.964 --> 27:40.398
Are...are we gonna wake one up?

27:40.463 --> 27:44.664
If you make noise, you can't hear him whispering.

27:44.730 --> 27:46.497
Greer.

27:47.530 --> 27:50.563
Makes him angry when he can't be heard.

27:50.630 --> 27:52.630
Dr. Byrd?

27:52.697 --> 27:55.697
Is that what you were protecting those children from?

27:56.697 --> 27:58.231
That's why you taught them that song,

27:58.298 --> 28:01.031
So that they could give you a warning anytime he got close.

28:01.097 --> 28:04.997
I don't want him to pluck their heads.

28:06.064 --> 28:08.331
That's how he got that little boy

28:08.398 --> 28:10.130
To write on the blackboard, isn't it?

28:10.197 --> 28:11.264
They're so trusting,

28:11.330 --> 28:14.464
And then when he whispers in their ears,

28:14.531 --> 28:17.631
It's hard not to listen,

28:17.697 --> 28:20.164
Even when you can't believe what he's saying.

28:20.230 --> 28:23.831
Like when he told you that you hurt your own child.

28:23.898 --> 28:25.597
Dr. Byrd understood.

28:25.664 --> 28:28.864
I loved my son so much,

28:28.930 --> 28:32.230
Sometimes it hurt to even look at him.

28:32.297 --> 28:34.564
He was so small and fragile.

28:35.697 --> 28:40.664
I don't know why I did what I did,

28:40.731 --> 28:42.030
Not anymore.

28:42.097 --> 28:43.798
I was sick.

28:43.864 --> 28:45.997
Y-your son is still alive.

28:46.063 --> 28:48.064
No, I remember holding him in the water.

28:48.131 --> 28:51.264
No, you gave him baths. You cared for him,

28:51.280 --> 28:52.831
and then when you thought that you were gonna hurt him,

28:52.898 --> 28:54.697
you turned him over.

28:54.764 --> 28:58.164
No, that's not possible. The doctor said...

28:58.230 --> 28:59.531
Well, the doctor lied.

29:00.297 --> 29:03.298
Ok, my friend, he talked to your son.

29:03.363 --> 29:06.164
Doug, he's still alive, and he's married with children of his own.

29:06.231 --> 29:07.864
Here. Just look.

29:10.897 --> 29:15.664
But wh-why would he tell me those things,

29:16.130 --> 29:19.331
My own doctor?

29:19.397 --> 29:21.030
He wasn't a doctor.

29:21.897 --> 29:23.264
He was a ghost.

29:25.231 --> 29:26.297
Look, you knew to...

29:26.364 --> 29:27.764
To keep him away from those children,

29:27.830 --> 29:29.830
So why would you believe what he had to say to you?

29:30.097 --> 29:33.597
They don't deserve to be punished, but I do.

29:33.864 --> 29:36.231
Even if I didn't hurt my child,

29:36.297 --> 29:38.197
I still abandoned him.

29:38.199 --> 29:39.533
That's not true.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.633
You asked for those shock treatments.

29:41.700 --> 29:43.867
You told your doctors that you would do anything

29:43.933 --> 29:46.200
Just to get home to be with your son.

29:47.633 --> 29:49.399
Think.

29:49.466 --> 29:52.300
Please, I know you can remember that.

29:57.766 --> 29:59.133
M-maybe I do.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.234
Good. Then please just look for the light,

30:01.299 --> 30:03.266
Because you're ready to move on.

30:03.333 --> 30:05.500
No, no. I... I can't leave them.

30:05.566 --> 30:07.767
Don't worry about them. I'll protect those children.

30:07.833 --> 30:10.433
Not just them, all my friends here.

30:10.500 --> 30:13.500
He whispers bad things to them, too.

30:13.566 --> 30:15.000
The patients.

30:15.467 --> 30:16.900
Where are they?

30:16.967 --> 30:18.833
He's dangerous.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.800
Don't make him angry.

30:20.867 --> 30:23.733
I'll take care of him. Where are your friends?

30:25.266 --> 30:27.566
It's a bad place down there.

30:27.633 --> 30:29.167
Don't go.

30:37.700 --> 30:39.700
She's gone.

30:39.767 --> 30:42.134
What was that about?

30:43.633 --> 30:45.333
Let's go.

30:52.866 --> 30:54.066
The tunnels are through here.

30:55.133 --> 30:56.600
You don't wanna go through that, do you?

30:57.367 --> 31:00.666
Yeah. That's the way that the kids went to get to the square.

31:00.733 --> 31:02.167
Through a locked metal door?

31:02.234 --> 31:03.733
Greer must have helped them.

31:03.800 --> 31:06.667
I mean, you've seen ghosts slam doors now, move things around.

31:06.733 --> 31:08.533
No, I've seen doors slam and things move around.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.134
I...I haven't seen ghosts do anything.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.266
Ok, well, whatever it is that you've seen,

31:12.273 --> 31:13.673
I need to get in here, so...

31:13.740 --> 31:14.673
Hey, Melinda, why?

31:14.740 --> 31:15.774
Why now? Why do you gotta do that?

31:15.840 --> 31:17.373
Because there's souls in there.

31:17.440 --> 31:18.807
They need help.

31:18.873 --> 31:21.973
Look, if this is too much for you to absorb in one sitting,

31:22.039 --> 31:23.874
It's...It's ok. You can go, and I...

31:23.939 --> 31:25.240
Why can't you?

31:25.306 --> 31:28.306
Why have we gotta take this to the end of the story, huh?

31:29.073 --> 31:30.706
The story?

31:30.773 --> 31:33.373
Look, if you're telling me that ghosts can,

31:33.440 --> 31:35.607
You know, move things, if they have mind control,

31:35.673 --> 31:38.000
They can disappear, they can reappear,

31:38.033 --> 31:39.734
Why can't they just cross themselves into the light,

31:39.741 --> 31:41.601
And then we're just done here, huh?

31:41.667 --> 31:42.900
You are done, aren't you?

31:48.601 --> 31:51.101
Look, I'm just... I'm just tired.

31:51.167 --> 31:52.500
No, you're done trying.

31:52.867 --> 31:54.034
No, it's not about trying.

31:54.100 --> 31:54.801
It's about some things make sense,

31:54.868 --> 31:56.401
And some things don't. I'm sorry...

31:56.567 --> 31:58.033
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.

31:58.700 --> 31:59.434
And if you don't keep trying,

31:59.501 --> 32:01.634
You're never gonna get back what you lost.

32:01.701 --> 32:03.501
Me? We were just talking about ghosts.

32:03.567 --> 32:05.033
Yeah, we are.

32:06.033 --> 32:08.300
Your memories...

32:08.367 --> 32:11.050
The reason that you can never make sense of them

32:11.050 --> 32:12.734
is they're not yours.

32:14.367 --> 32:16.868
They belong to a ghost...

32:16.934 --> 32:18.567
Ok. Now, look...

32:18.634 --> 32:22.267
Someone who died and then went into Sam's body.

32:22.334 --> 32:25.701
S-sam? You're talking about Sam as if he's...

32:25.767 --> 32:27.200
He's gone.

32:27.267 --> 32:29.167
He went into the light.

32:29.234 --> 32:30.501
You're not Sam anymore.

32:30.567 --> 32:32.167
- Who am I?  - Jim.

32:33.968 --> 32:35.167
My husband.

32:36.100 --> 32:38.934
Or at least, what's left of him.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.167
You may not remember that now, and you may never

32:41.234 --> 32:44.067
remember that, but I told you to go into the light,

32:44.133 --> 32:47.334
And you wouldn't, and then Sam's body offered a second chance.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.201
Ok, listen, Melinda.

32:48.268 --> 32:49.800
Look, I know how hard it is to accept this, ok?

32:49.867 --> 32:51.901
But just think about what's happened.

32:52.267 --> 32:53.568
All the random memories,

32:53.634 --> 32:54.800
The gunshot, all those things

32:54.867 --> 32:56.733
That you suddenly remembered about medicine...

32:56.800 --> 32:59.568
Those things came from Jim, and then...

33:00.534 --> 33:03.067
Then there's me.

33:06.334 --> 33:07.700
What you feel...

33:09.034 --> 33:10.867
What we both feel,

33:10.934 --> 33:13.700
You remembering that you wanted children...

33:13.767 --> 33:15.601
That all came from someplace.

33:17.934 --> 33:21.833
It came from a life that you shared with me.

33:26.267 --> 33:29.167
That has to mean something, right?

33:37.334 --> 33:39.668
Yes, it means something.

33:41.668 --> 33:44.501
It means that... that you lost your husband,

33:44.568 --> 33:46.034
And it turned your life upside down,

33:46.100 --> 33:47.616
And it's worse than anything I lost,

33:47.616 --> 33:48.733
because you know what you lost.

33:48.800 --> 33:51.034
We have to face facts, you and I,

33:51.100 --> 33:54.167
And the fact is that what is gone is gone.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.167
I'm not Jim.

33:58.767 --> 34:01.601
I'm...I'm not your husband.

34:10.733 --> 34:12.201
In the basement of a former asylum,

34:12.266 --> 34:13.201
You told him everything?

34:13.266 --> 34:14.733
Yeah. What else was I supposed to do?

34:14.800 --> 34:17.234
I don't know. Wait till he has a couple drinks in him

34:17.301 --> 34:19.201
Or, you know, right until after sex.

34:19.266 --> 34:21.001
Wait. You haven't had sex yet?

34:21.067 --> 34:22.034
I'm not telling you that.

34:22.100 --> 34:23.233
What planet are you from?

34:23.233 --> 34:25.434
Don't you know you never open the closet door

34:25.449 --> 34:27.107
Until you make sex.

34:27.484 --> 34:30.417
Please hold the flashlight.

34:36.850 --> 34:40.350
Oh, my god! You're psycho! I'm not going in there with you.

34:40.417 --> 34:41.417
Dr. Byrd is a shrink.

34:41.484 --> 34:44.016
You don't go into a knife fight without taking your knife.

34:44.083 --> 34:45.683
Oh, I'm really not that sharp.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.016
Get in there.

34:47.083 --> 34:48.350
- I don't... - Go!

34:49.683 --> 34:52.750
Too creepy!

34:57.650 --> 34:59.850
Why are you here?

34:59.917 --> 35:02.150
Who said that?

35:02.217 --> 35:03.650
You better show yourself.

35:03.716 --> 35:06.250
Or better yet, show yourself somewhere else.

35:06.817 --> 35:09.451
Calm down. They're just ghosts.

35:24.251 --> 35:26.551
Way too spooky. Need more lights.

35:26.616 --> 35:27.484
Good.

35:27.551 --> 35:29.583
That's much better.

35:37.551 --> 35:38.750
What do you see?

35:38.817 --> 35:41.250
Greer.

35:41.317 --> 35:42.983
Show us the way.

35:43.050 --> 35:45.250
We'll help your friends find the light.

35:57.451 --> 35:59.750
It's the treatment room,

35:59.817 --> 36:01.783
Where she got her shock therapy.

36:13.983 --> 36:16.551
The doctor's looking for me.

36:16.616 --> 36:17.916
He'll be here soon.

36:18.383 --> 36:19.517
Then we don't have much time.

36:19.583 --> 36:20.683
We need your help.

36:20.750 --> 36:21.683
How?

36:21.750 --> 36:22.917
Your friends...

36:23.983 --> 36:26.484
They're troubled. Help us talk to them.

36:27.917 --> 36:29.117
Help them bring the light.

36:29.184 --> 36:31.050
Ok.

36:33.417 --> 36:36.350
He's trapped you here with fear, fear of the light,

36:36.417 --> 36:38.217
But you don't have to be afraid.

36:38.284 --> 36:40.683
Time is running out. Just believe us.

36:40.750 --> 36:42.917
What's going on?

36:48.583 --> 36:50.417
Are we making new friends?

36:51.550 --> 36:53.883
I trust we're not forgetting our old ones.

36:53.950 --> 36:55.650
They all know that you've been lying to them.

36:55.717 --> 36:57.284
If part of your job was to help them,

36:57.351 --> 36:58.683
You might wanna remember how to do that.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.050
I think I help 'em.

37:00.917 --> 37:03.350
Who brings you news of your loved ones?

37:03.417 --> 37:06.183
Who tells your family what you want them to know,

37:06.250 --> 37:09.183
Not the true things, the bad thoughts,

37:09.250 --> 37:12.784
The secrets, the nasty things I know, but keep safe?

37:12.950 --> 37:13.884
You, doctor.

37:13.950 --> 37:16.617
And who really knows you deep down,

37:16.654 --> 37:18.153
But takes care of you anyway?

37:18.220 --> 37:20.653
These people? Strangers?

37:21.220 --> 37:22.320
Don't trust them.

37:22.387 --> 37:23.887
They said you lied about the light.

37:24.186 --> 37:25.353
Oh? Did I?

37:25.420 --> 37:28.687
Is there someone here who wants to go into the light?

37:28.754 --> 37:30.387
We might.

37:30.453 --> 37:31.753
Then go ahead.

37:31.820 --> 37:34.087
What do you think the light's gonna do

37:34.153 --> 37:38.587
When it knows all your secrets just like I do?

37:40.854 --> 37:43.153
You'll go into oblivion.

37:43.287 --> 37:45.121
Greer, look into the light.

37:45.486 --> 37:48.820
Tell them. Tell your friends what you see.

37:55.020 --> 37:56.553
My parents.

37:58.287 --> 37:59.753
My brothers and sisters.

37:59.820 --> 38:02.853
What do you see in their eyes? Is it judgement?

38:02.920 --> 38:06.287
No. Just...

38:06.654 --> 38:08.087
Love.

38:08.153 --> 38:11.587
Please, tell them.

38:11.654 --> 38:14.354
Over here, everyone. Look inside.

38:14.420 --> 38:18.120
Don't trust 'em. You can't go.

38:20.387 --> 38:23.153
Trust your fears. They'll protect you.

38:27.287 --> 38:28.487
It's a mistake!

38:32.254 --> 38:34.920
You're not gonna trick me into that hole.

38:34.987 --> 38:37.387
You might find forgiveness there.

38:37.987 --> 38:41.320
Oh, I'll be staying right here, where you live.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.753
What are you waiting for?

38:48.420 --> 38:49.387
Go.

38:49.454 --> 38:51.687
I have something to do first.

38:55.987 --> 38:59.653
Your mother wants you to know how badly she feels.

39:04.553 --> 39:06.753
All the time you spent without her,

39:06.820 --> 39:08.620
She...she thinks it's her fault.

39:08.686 --> 39:09.887
Her fault?

39:11.087 --> 39:12.853
How is it her fault?

39:12.920 --> 39:15.620
She was happy and healthy until I was born.

39:15.686 --> 39:21.720
My body, it just wasn't strong enough.

39:21.787 --> 39:24.220
She still doesn't realize that doctors then,

39:24.287 --> 39:27.887
They had no idea, no idea what could happen to mothers.

39:27.953 --> 39:30.987
None of that matters anymore.

39:31.054 --> 39:35.120
Looking at you, I feel so strong now.

39:35.187 --> 39:40.354
But seeing you grown up, she feels healthy and strong.

39:48.553 --> 39:49.887
I'm all better.

39:49.953 --> 39:52.920
The bad thoughts are gone,

39:52.987 --> 39:56.354
And the lifetime together that we missed...

39:56.421 --> 39:57.787
You'll spend it...

39:57.853 --> 40:00.787
On the other side.

40:01.787 --> 40:04.220
Will you tell him I'll wait for him?

40:07.320 --> 40:09.521
But to take his time.

40:09.586 --> 40:15.254
He has children who need him,

40:15.320 --> 40:16.753
My grandchildren.

40:16.820 --> 40:18.953
I promise.

40:19.020 --> 40:20.387
I'll tell him.

40:56.320 --> 40:58.720
Well,that was a pretty big bombshell you dropped on me back there.

40:58.787 --> 40:59.920
I know. I'm sorry.

40:59.987 --> 41:02.054
I really wish that there'd been another way.

41:02.121 --> 41:03.954
Look, I understand this. I do.

41:04.021 --> 41:05.120
- Really?  - Yeah.

41:05.187 --> 41:06.420
I think I finally do.

41:06.486 --> 41:09.287
I mean, it didn't make any sense to me before, but then...

41:09.353 --> 41:11.454
I remembered some stuff.

41:11.521 --> 41:12.686
Well, like what?

41:13.753 --> 41:15.686
Well, first there was the hospital.

41:15.953 --> 41:19.220
You know, every time I woke up, you were there.

41:19.287 --> 41:20.943
Yeah. I...I was worried about you.

41:20.943 --> 41:23.586
Yeah. I mean, you were there every minute,

41:23.853 --> 41:25.920
Whether I was asleep or I was awake.

41:25.987 --> 41:27.020
Yeah.

41:27.087 --> 41:29.387
I kept asking myself, "why would she do that?"

41:29.454 --> 41:34.087
You know, unless it was about not me, but your husband.

41:34.453 --> 41:37.320
Which you said, you know, but then I remembered some other stuff

41:37.386 --> 41:40.154
Was that you kept talking about that ghost doctor

41:40.220 --> 41:42.886
And how he made people do things by whispering in their ear.

41:42.953 --> 41:43.787
No. Wait. I...

41:43.853 --> 41:45.020
That's what you did.

41:45.287 --> 41:46.687
You whispered in my ear.

41:46.954 --> 41:49.054
All those hours you sat by my bed,

41:49.121 --> 41:54.087
I mean...you decided you couldn't accept that your husband is dead,

41:54.454 --> 41:57.387
So you made up your mind that his spirit is in me,

41:57.454 --> 41:59.620
And so you filled my head with his memories.

41:59.686 --> 42:01.187
You wanted to make it real for yourself. The gunshots...

42:01.254 --> 42:02.287
Please don't do this.

42:02.354 --> 42:03.887
The paramedic stuff, wanting to have kids.

42:03.953 --> 42:05.421
The longer that you don't accept it...

42:05.487 --> 42:06.787
No, no. You have to stop, ok?

42:06.853 --> 42:08.421
It's all a fantasy.

42:08.487 --> 42:10.387
Stop.

42:10.454 --> 42:11.387
You need help.

42:11.454 --> 42:12.787
I wanna be there for you, all right,

42:12.853 --> 42:14.720
But you need professional help.

42:15.087 --> 42:16.353
I'll do whatever it takes.

42:16.420 --> 42:18.020
I'll get the best doctors. I'll wait for you.

42:18.087 --> 42:20.053
No, I think you've got it backwards.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.687
I think you're the one that needs help.

42:22.753 --> 42:25.654
No, Melinda. You're angry right now.

42:25.660 --> 42:27.327
I can't do this anymore.

42:29.561 --> 42:31.993
I can't.

42:33.327 --> 42:38.161
You have a... a lifetime of memories buried somewhere,

42:38.227 --> 42:40.460
But the obstacle that you need to move is you.

42:40.527 --> 42:41.493
No.

42:41.982 --> 42:44.115
I tried.

42:46.082 --> 42:48.949
I really, really tried.

42:52.316 --> 42:54.415
I think you should just get your things and leave.

42:54.782 --> 42:56.382
- Melinda...  - Good-bye.
