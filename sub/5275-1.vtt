01:00.060 --> 01:01.227
You move over.

01:01.353 --> 01:04.605
Hey, this is Luke. This is my film.
Let me ask you a couple of questions.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.274
Why do you dance?

01:06.400 --> 01:08.943
Because it's like breathing,
it's like walking to me.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.070
I'm not pretending.
When I dance I don't pretend.

01:11.196 --> 01:14.240
l'm more myself when l dance
than any other moment of the day.

01:14.366 --> 01:17.493
I dance to become someone else.

01:17.619 --> 01:20.997
There are so many things in this world
that want to push down on you,

01:21.123 --> 01:22.373
but when you dance you are free.

01:22.499 --> 01:26.961
We started dancing at the age of seven
in our house, in the living room.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.964
Just dancing, dancing,
copying Michael Jackson.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.633
And I'm just like listening to the music
in the grocery store,

01:32.760 --> 01:34.969
just like dancing through the aisles
and stuff like that,

01:35.095 --> 01:37.096
and she's like,
"Contain yourself, calm down."

01:37.222 --> 01:39.932
And l'm like, "l can't stop,
I have to do it, I have to do it."

01:40.058 --> 01:44.437
After everybody went to sleep I would
open the garage and just practise.

01:44.563 --> 01:48.316
That's pretty much when I knew
I loved it because I had never dedicated

01:48.442 --> 01:50.610
so much time and effort
into something like that.

01:50.736 --> 01:53.237
It's not us just jumping around.
Dance has vocabulary.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.822
- lnglewood.
- I'm from Argentina.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.032
I'm from northern Uganda.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.700
- Miami, Florida.
- Koreatown, Los Angeles.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.327
There's a lot of gangs and violence.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.787
I couldn't be stuck there all my life.

02:00.913 --> 02:01.746
My village was attacked.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.581
My parents didn't even want me
around any more.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.041
She actually kicked me out of the house.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.876
- l had to go.
- Dance saved me.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.419
Dance definitely saved me.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.797
lf it wasn't for dance,
I don't know what we'd be doing right now.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.173
I didn't have anything,
I didn't have money.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.259
I was living with $1 5 a week
in New York City.

02:15.385 --> 02:18.179
Dance brought us together too,
all around the world. We're here.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.181
Truth is everybody is a dancer inside.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.307
We all have a heartbeat.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.976
We all have a rhythm inside.
Boom-boom, boom-boom.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.896
- What's that one thing you say?
- Yeah, what do you call us?

02:27.022 --> 02:28.564
- (Luke) Born from a boombox?
- Yes.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.275
- Born from a boombox.
- That's pretty good.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.485
Born from a boombox.

02:32.611 --> 02:35.238
(Luke) It sounds stupid,
but I do feeI Iike that.

02:35.364 --> 02:36.906
And if we listen hard enough,

02:37.032 --> 02:40.409
we realise that maybe we're all
pIugged into the same song.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.840
(♪ Dance music)

02:54.842 --> 02:58.261
New York University freshmen,
welcome to Washington Square Park.

02:58.387 --> 03:02.473
It's the central hub of our urban campus,
and to the right...

03:08.063 --> 03:10.565
Mom? Dad? You guys can really go.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.775
No! We're gonna take you
and Camille out for dinner.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.443
We promised her parents we'd feed her.

03:14.570 --> 03:16.404
We're already paying for our meal plans.
It's all good.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.072
Yeah, we're fine, we really are, Mrs A.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.866
- We should go.
- All right. One last picture.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.200
OK. One last picture.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.911
Get together, you're best friends,
you could drive a truck through you.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.789
- We're close.
- Get closer! Put your arm around her.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.332
- OK.
- Good boy.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.668
All right. Ready? Say, "Mom is pretty."

03:30.794 --> 03:32.628
- (Both) Mom is pretty.
- Thank you.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.297
(Laughs) Ready? And... Oop.

03:34.423 --> 03:38.092
Oh. Look at this. Picture of a hat.
I got a hat with hair.

03:38.218 --> 03:42.346
lf my father could see me now saying
goodbye to my son, a future engineer...

03:42.472 --> 03:45.224
l'm just so happy you're done
with that dance business, I can't tell you.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.517
Oh, but you have...

03:46.643 --> 03:49.645
- OK, all right. You make me proud.
- OK. This is it.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.314
Could I get in your backpack? Come on.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.774
- That's too tight. OK. All right.
- Come on.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.902
I'll make you proud
if I could just go to orientation.

03:56.028 --> 03:58.237
- No! You're my baby.
- Everybody left already.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.948
- All right. OK.
- I'll call you when I get to the dorm.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.034
- Wear deodorant, deodorant. Every day.
- Come on.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.619
- OK, honey? It's important.
- Come on, honey.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.746
- Cos you're a man now.
- Honey, we got to beat the traffic.

04:06.872 --> 04:07.955
All right.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.125
- Wow! They really...
- Are embarrassing.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.836
- I was gonna say "love you".
- Sorry.

04:15.339 --> 04:17.089
Hey, Cam, check those out.

04:17.214 --> 04:20.134
Those are the limited edition
gunmetal Nike Dunks.

04:20.260 --> 04:25.181
Uh-oh. I know that look. OK, Moose,
seriously, next on the tour, Union Square.

04:25.307 --> 04:29.060
I just wanna get a closer look.
I'm gonna be right back. OK? Cover me.

04:29.186 --> 04:30.645
I guess.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.153
(Cheering)

04:39.279 --> 04:41.280
(♪ NASA: Whatchadoin?)

04:43.909 --> 04:45.618
(Bookie) All right, let's go, who you got?

04:45.744 --> 04:49.246
- I want 25 on Kid Darkness.
- 25 on Darkness, let's go, let's go.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.084
(Cheering)

04:54.044 --> 04:55.920
- Give my money.
- Sorry, guy, I got you.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.297
Oh, snap! Did you see that?

05:01.176 --> 05:02.843
Yo, I want ten on the skinny kid.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.639
Give me 20.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.183
Give me that 20.

05:15.524 --> 05:17.066
Yo, you see that?

05:17.192 --> 05:18.567
Oh, whoo-hoo-hoo!

05:19.611 --> 05:21.529
It's over, it's over, that's it!

05:21.655 --> 05:23.406
Go home! Go home!

05:24.366 --> 05:26.367
Come on, new kid, get in there!

05:27.327 --> 05:28.995
Come on, let's see what you got.

05:29.121 --> 05:31.288
I think we're done here.

05:31.415 --> 05:32.999
He ain't got no flava.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.835
- Yo, look at the kid!
- He moves pretty good for a geek.

05:35.961 --> 05:38.629
Buddy, that kid is real!
Been holding out!

05:39.464 --> 05:41.465
I didn't know that dude
could dance like that.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.718
Let's go, new kid,
let's see what you got.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.345
Hey, you give me five on that.
Give me five on that.

05:52.436 --> 05:53.853
Let's go, Darkness!

05:58.734 --> 06:04.947
(Crowd) Oh!

06:10.078 --> 06:12.079
(Cheering)

06:21.423 --> 06:23.382
Buddy, that kid is real!

06:26.595 --> 06:27.970
(Laughs)

06:35.020 --> 06:37.438
(Crowd) Oh!

06:42.235 --> 06:44.779
Who's gonna pay for my balloons?
Hey, he's right here!

06:44.905 --> 06:48.282
- Get this guy.
- Stop! Police! Hold it right there!

06:48.408 --> 06:51.243
Come on, man. They're after you.
Go. Come on!

06:53.038 --> 06:54.789
Come on, kid.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.252
Come on, let's go.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.879
All right, man, time-out. I can't.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.881
We don't have time for that. Come on!

07:04.007 --> 07:06.217
- Police!
- Get out of the way!

07:07.761 --> 07:09.637
What are you doing? What are you doing?

07:09.763 --> 07:11.430
Jump first, fear later.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.518
Whoa.

07:15.644 --> 07:18.104
- Get out of the way!
- (Luke) Come on, come on!

07:18.980 --> 07:19.980
(Moose) Excuse me!

07:20.107 --> 07:22.108
Out of the way! Out of the way, folks.

07:25.529 --> 07:27.321
(Moose) Oh. Ah.

07:27.447 --> 07:31.617
My ribcage. I feel like
I just threw up in my mouth.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.869
- lt's burning.
- (Car horns beeping)

07:33.995 --> 07:36.205
Where are you going?

07:36.331 --> 07:37.581
Yo.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.376
How did you just do that back there?

07:40.502 --> 07:43.754
I mean, you were like freaking flying, man.
You're like a ninja.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.090
- Luke.
- No, it's like this. You gotta blow it up.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.134
(Makes explosive noise)

07:48.260 --> 07:50.261
Ah, come on.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.264
How's that?

07:53.390 --> 07:54.473
All right.

07:54.599 --> 07:57.017
I'm Robert Alexander the Third,
by the way.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.062
Just since you ask.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.856
But you can just call me Moose.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.650
- I haven't seen you around.
- I'm just starting at NYU.

08:04.776 --> 08:07.319
- I'm actually an engineering major.
- But you're gonna be dancing too.

08:07.445 --> 08:08.821
No, no, no, not any more.

08:08.947 --> 08:12.283
I mean, dancing was cool in high school,
but it's time for me to face the real world.

08:12.409 --> 08:15.828
You really have no idea
what you did back there, do you?

08:15.954 --> 08:18.455
- You're B-FAB.
- What's a B-FAB?

08:18.582 --> 08:20.499
- Born from a boombox.
- (Laughs)

08:20.625 --> 08:23.878
Like, some people learn to dance,
others are born to.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.630
And you're in New York City,
the dance centre of the world.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.216
Check this.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.888
It's the biggest battle ever.
There's never been this kind of prize money.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.222
And those guys in the park,
they're gearing up for this.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.143
You're good enough.
You should be in this.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.898
(Moose) This your car?

08:44.024 --> 08:46.901
Oh, my God, that's so sick!

08:47.027 --> 08:48.903
Get in.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.822
What you saw in the park today
is just the beginning.

08:52.824 --> 08:55.367
(♪ Jay-Z & Alicia Keys:
Empire State of Mind)

09:46.586 --> 09:48.712
This is it.

09:50.173 --> 09:52.800
- What the heck is this place?
- Come on.

09:54.511 --> 09:57.221
Welcome to my house.
The House of Pirates.

09:58.890 --> 09:59.890
(Muffled music)

10:00.016 --> 10:03.352
Nice place. It's a little small to live in.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.021
(Clanging)

10:06.147 --> 10:08.482
My parents converted this place years ago.

10:08.608 --> 10:12.194
We all live and train upstairs and run a club
downstairs to make ends meet.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.864
Kinda like a secret hideout.
Right, this is it.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.827
We call this the Vault.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.954
(♪ K'naan: ABC's)

10:27.627 --> 10:29.962
Around here, dance is your identity.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.756
We live together, work together,
battle together.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.801
But unlike other crews,
we all have different styles.

10:35.927 --> 10:39.847
I found all these guys out in the city.
Crazy talent but no place to go.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.558
We've become kind of a pseudo family here

10:42.684 --> 10:44.685
where we can be ourselves
and rules don't apply.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.980
This place is off the chain.

10:48.106 --> 10:51.066
Thing 1 and Thing 2 over there,
that's the Santiago twins.

10:51.192 --> 10:54.403
You, man, you... We saw you dancing
at the park this morning. You were...

10:54.529 --> 10:56.613
- Amazing!
- You are from another planet.

10:56.740 --> 11:00.242
- Your own planet! You're amazing, man.
- l have a question...

11:00.368 --> 11:03.579
No, no, no, guys. Come on. No questions.
I gotta show him around.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.581
Got it! Come on.

11:05.707 --> 11:06.665
You're great!

11:06.791 --> 11:08.751
- Luke.
- Jacob!

11:08.877 --> 11:10.502
What's up, brother?

11:10.628 --> 11:12.880
- Meet Moose.
- Pleased to meet you, Moose.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.299
This guy right here,
he's the captain of the ship.

11:15.425 --> 11:19.261
More like the first mate. I heard you did
some impressive work in the park today.

11:19.387 --> 11:20.596
How does everybody know that?

11:20.722 --> 11:23.390
News travels fast when you beat someone
like Kid Darkness.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.393
But, Luke, l need to borrow you
for one second. We've got some things...

11:26.519 --> 11:28.937
- Can we wait? I've got to show him around.
- We'll take him.

11:29.064 --> 11:30.147
Let us show him around.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.024
- I don't know about that, guys.
- Please!

11:32.150 --> 11:34.026
- Please. What would Jesus do?
- Come on.

11:34.569 --> 11:36.528
- All right. Don't hurt him, all right?
- Promise.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.864
Moose, this is the Ticks. Good luck.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.450
(Excited chatter)

11:41.576 --> 11:43.744
This came from the bank today.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.579
We're six months late on our payments.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.165
- We paid them last month.
- What about the other five?

11:48.291 --> 11:50.626
We're working on it.
The club's not making the money it used to.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.087
The bank doesn't want to hear that.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.590
If they don't get the money they're going
to put the Vault up for public auction.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.093
Listen, don't I always have a plan?

11:59.219 --> 12:02.971
This kid, Moose, he beat Kid Darkness
today, and he did it with style.

12:03.098 --> 12:05.766
With a little bit of training,
he could be the spark that we need

12:05.892 --> 12:09.353
to win the hundred grand from
the World Jam and pay back what we owe.

12:09.479 --> 12:13.982
Jacob, we're not gonna lose the Vault,
all right? We won't let that happen.

12:14.109 --> 12:17.403
(Tick 2) You don't understand. Nobody ever
smoked Kid Darkness and got it on tape.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.029
(Pirates) Whoo!

12:19.155 --> 12:21.073
- That was serious.
- You're the man.

12:21.199 --> 12:23.200
You think the Samurais
are gonna let you go like that?

12:23.326 --> 12:25.577
They'll find you and they'll batter you again.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.579
- Sam who?
- The House of Samurai.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.456
The most cut-throat house in the city.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.333
- Our fiercest rival.
- Yeah.

12:31.459 --> 12:32.835
They're gonna find me?

12:32.961 --> 12:36.004
They got technology out there,
like the bears with a little GPS inside.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.340
- Watch out, they're right behind you!
- (Laughter)

12:38.466 --> 12:41.009
Come on, that's enough.
Don't let them freak you out.

12:41.136 --> 12:43.637
- You're with us now.
- And nobody messes with us.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.306
- Not even the Samurai.
- Not unless you want to get roasted!

12:46.433 --> 12:47.808
(Cheering)

12:47.934 --> 12:51.895
Unless they want to get
a big patata in their traste!

12:52.021 --> 12:53.772
(Both speaking Spanish)

12:56.734 --> 12:58.277
- What?
- OK, you don't get it

12:58.403 --> 13:00.654
but I know what I'm saying.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.448
(Chatter continues)

13:02.574 --> 13:04.950
(Twins) You got it.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.870
- That's not boring.
- (Tick 2) Losers.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.997
(Chatter continues)

13:10.957 --> 13:14.668
She's back.
The one I've been telling you about.

13:15.420 --> 13:18.839
Hey, Moose. Come on,
I'll show you round the club downstairs.

13:18.965 --> 13:22.134
- Party pooper!
- (Tick 3) Come on, Luke.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.636
Come on, this way.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.639
(♪ T-Pain: Take Your Shirt Off)

13:32.729 --> 13:34.146
Oh!

13:34.272 --> 13:36.773
What? What?

13:36.900 --> 13:39.109
(Luke) Watch out, they bite.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.237
(Cheering)

13:45.742 --> 13:48.869
Crazy, right? Hang out, take a look around.
I'll be back in a second.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.008
(Crowd groans)

15:26.968 --> 15:28.802
(Muffled music)

15:39.272 --> 15:41.106
(Toilet flushes)

15:54.370 --> 15:56.830
Nobody battles the Samurai just once.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.084
Now it's time for the real battle.

16:02.045 --> 16:04.880
- (Samurai laughs)
- Come on, now, you scared?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.007
Come here, man.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.842
(♪ Dance music)

16:16.517 --> 16:19.561
Where do you think you're goin'?
This ain't over yet.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.650
Get him, Baba, get him.

16:27.945 --> 16:28.904
Ow!

16:29.030 --> 16:30.572
Go get the kid!

16:40.249 --> 16:42.042
(Cheering)

17:12.740 --> 17:15.867
I just want a few rounds with the kid.
We got some unfinished business.

17:15.992 --> 17:18.286
You wanna get to him,
you gotta go through us.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.915
Come on, Luke. Be a good sport.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.459
- What are you doing here, Julien?
- Nice to see you, too.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.502
Get your boys and get off our property.

17:26.628 --> 17:29.923
Your property? It's not gonna be
your property for much longer.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.843
And don't worry. When I buy this place,
I'll take good care of it.

17:32.969 --> 17:36.555
When we win the World Jam, you and your
trust fund won't be able to touch us.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.682
(Crowd) Whoa.

17:41.436 --> 17:44.271
That's cute.
Your boy can't even finish his battles.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.606
Bubbles and balloons? That's so amateur.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.067
Enough, man. He will finish it
at the World Jam and so will we.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.861
I don't even know what you just said.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.321
Yo, man, stop being disrespectful
to my crew, yo.

17:53.448 --> 17:54.448
(Hubbub)

17:59.328 --> 18:01.580
Get off!

18:01.706 --> 18:03.373
Hey.

18:05.418 --> 18:08.211
Come on, I'll get you out of here.
Get off her, man.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.092
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

18:15.178 --> 18:17.012
Thank you.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.639
I'm Luke.

18:20.391 --> 18:22.184
I'm Natalie.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.770
So, what's with the bags?

18:24.896 --> 18:29.399
Oh. I'm supposed to be meeting my friend
here but I guess she's a no-show.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.985
Well, what are you gonna do?

18:32.111 --> 18:34.196
I don't know, I haven't figured that out yet.

18:34.322 --> 18:36.281
You could stay here.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.911
- What, in the club?
- No, I mean upstairs, in the living room.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.248
You don't even know me.

18:45.374 --> 18:49.211
Yeah, I do. Your name's Natalie
and you need a place to sleep.

18:52.173 --> 18:55.050
OK. Sure, thank you.

18:55.176 --> 18:57.219
OK. Grab your stuff.

18:57.345 --> 18:59.346
(Shouting)

19:10.149 --> 19:11.817
Are you sure they won't mind?

19:11.943 --> 19:14.945
Everyone here knows what it's like
to be a nomad.

19:16.697 --> 19:19.699
- So where are you from?
- Here.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.910
But I've been living in London
the last few years.

19:22.036 --> 19:23.119
Wow.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.498
Well, this place'll be a departure.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.041
Thank you.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.960
You're welcome.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.881
So, are you ready?

19:35.007 --> 19:36.174
For bed?

19:36.300 --> 19:40.303
No, for the battle. The World Jam?
We could really use someone like you.

19:40.429 --> 19:44.015
- Are you up for a little competition?
- lt's what l live for.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.476
- Been competing my whole life.
- Do you win?

19:46.602 --> 19:47.978
I never lose.

19:48.771 --> 19:49.813
Good.

19:51.357 --> 19:55.193
I'll see you in the morning.
We have a lot of work to do.

20:04.745 --> 20:08.623
Moose. Where were you yesterday?
I thought we had plans.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.001
- I know, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

20:11.127 --> 20:15.088
I had to eat dinner with my freakazoid
roommate who smells so badly.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.508
And she would not stop yammering
about her pet rat's blog.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.927
We should hook our roommates
up together.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.805
Mine looks like a pet rat.
He's got the nose and everything,

20:23.931 --> 20:26.933
- he's got, like, the claws. Ugh!
- (Laughs)

20:27.059 --> 20:29.394
Oh. There you go!

20:29.520 --> 20:31.771
Now I need you to help me find
this engineering lab.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.065
- Moose.
- What?

20:35.234 --> 20:37.027
(Sighs)

20:37.153 --> 20:40.280
- What would I do without you?
- l don't know. l really don't.

20:42.325 --> 20:44.200
(She sighs)

20:44.327 --> 20:46.286
Later, gator.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.413
(Muffled music)

21:10.436 --> 21:12.437
(♪ Dance music)

21:22.740 --> 21:25.325
I see you've found the speaker room.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.661
- Yeah.
- (Music stops)

21:27.787 --> 21:31.164
I built this myself when we could actually
find boomboxes in the city.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.249
- Impressive.
- (Laughs)

21:33.376 --> 21:35.752
- You're up early.
- Already warmed up.

21:35.878 --> 21:40.048
Good. Cos you're my new recruit.
It's my responsibility to get you up to speed.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.677
- Then let's train.
- No, no, no. We're not training here.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.095
OK. Then where?

21:45.221 --> 21:46.888
Out there.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.474
Just try to keep up.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.685
(♪ Dance music)

22:05.324 --> 22:08.618
Before we divide up into lab groups
and begin the work, though,

22:08.744 --> 22:12.789
I wanna talk to you about,
well, what engineering means to me.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.457
What's your name?

22:14.583 --> 22:16.835
(Teacher) And what hopefully engineering
will mean to you.

22:16.961 --> 22:19.129
Silence, that's my name.

22:19.255 --> 22:22.090
- Silence during class.
- (Teacher) Second of all...

22:34.353 --> 22:36.521
(Phone ringing)

22:36.647 --> 22:39.065
Go answer it, Mr Popular.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.077
(Laughs) What?

22:51.203 --> 22:55.457
Open up the cages, boys. Show these
newbies why we call this the Vault.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.417
(Twin 1 ) OK.
(Both) Hey.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.919
Moose boy. How are you, my friend?

23:00.046 --> 23:02.714
- Oh. What a beautiful senorita.
- Por favor.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.049
Nice to meet you.

23:04.967 --> 23:07.260
- Can I give you two?
- (Laughs)

23:07.386 --> 23:08.303
Come on.

23:08.429 --> 23:10.555
- You gonna get mad at me?
- I'm not gonna get mad at you.

23:10.681 --> 23:12.557
I'm just saying hi to her, man.

23:12.683 --> 23:14.934
- I'm introducing myself.
- No, no, no.

23:15.061 --> 23:18.188
You stopped me when I'm introducing
myself to this beautiful...

23:18.314 --> 23:20.523
- Don't listen to him. Don't listen.
- You are so cute.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.734
- (Both speak Spanish)
- OK.

23:23.861 --> 23:28.031
Ladies and gentlemen,
our most prized possessions.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.790
Check it out.

23:36.916 --> 23:40.585
(Twin 2) If dance is our weapon,
then this is our armour.

23:40.711 --> 23:42.879
These are the most beautiful shoes
in the world.

23:43.005 --> 23:46.716
- The way they smell, the way they fit.
- (Twin 1 ) You're sounding like a girl, man.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.510
You're like, "I love the shoes."

23:48.636 --> 23:52.305
You gotta say, "I love the shoes,"
like a macho man. OK, bro.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.058
Luke's lucky shoes? Smart boy.

23:55.184 --> 23:58.812
(Luke) OK, Moose, don't get too attached,
you gotta earn your kicks in this house.

23:59.855 --> 24:02.899
And beyond door number two,
the Graffiti room.

24:03.025 --> 24:03.942
Oh, what?

24:04.068 --> 24:06.402
- Who's that guy?
- That? That's Jason.

24:06.529 --> 24:10.657
He's our graffiti guru. l'm talking
electronic billboard hacks, LED lights,

24:10.783 --> 24:11.991
anything to mark who we are.

24:12.118 --> 24:16.246
Dudes! Excellent timing. l have been
working on a portable light tagging system

24:16.372 --> 24:18.957
and I can't figure out how to get it to stick
to 12V batteries...

24:19.083 --> 24:21.876
- You got any electrical tape?
- Yeah, there you go.

24:22.002 --> 24:25.171
Tape it right there, wrap it round
and it creates a snug fit.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.382
- You know lights?
- Yeah, I dabble.

24:27.508 --> 24:29.467
Check it out.

24:30.302 --> 24:33.596
You... Yes! Yes! I love this kid!

24:33.722 --> 24:36.224
Fix the LED to the battery to the magnet.

24:36.350 --> 24:39.144
They're beautiful.
Like neon fireflies.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.980
- Neoflies.
- Yeah, neoflies.

24:42.106 --> 24:43.940
Neoflies. I like it.

24:44.358 --> 24:46.067
(Chatter)

24:46.193 --> 24:47.527
Cool. Check it out.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.446
Yeah, we could do something with this.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.366
- (Carlos whistles)
- Neoflies.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.536
Listen up. World Jam
is right around the corner,

24:56.662 --> 25:00.081
but to get there, we got to get through
the two qualifying rounds, which means...

25:00.207 --> 25:03.126
Which means
we got a lot of work cut out for us.

25:03.252 --> 25:05.503
Moose, Natalie. Are you guys in?

25:05.629 --> 25:07.255
(Plays suspenseful music)

25:08.048 --> 25:09.674
Erm...

25:09.800 --> 25:11.843
I don't know,
I mean, I have to go to school...

25:11.969 --> 25:13.386
We'll figure something out.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.306
Pirates... Pirates...

25:16.432 --> 25:21.269
(Chanting) Pirates! Pirates! Pirates!

25:21.395 --> 25:24.147
- I can do one battle, guys.
- (Cheering)

25:24.273 --> 25:25.857
All right, all right. Natalie?

25:25.983 --> 25:27.150

26:18.577 --> 26:19.619
(Tick) Owww!

26:24.458 --> 26:25.583
Whoo!

26:26.252 --> 26:27.252
Yeah!

26:34.468 --> 26:35.510
Whoo!

27:49.668 --> 27:50.960
Whoo-hoo!

28:09.480 --> 28:13.024
(AnaIa) l'm more of myself when
l dance than any other moment of the day.

28:13.150 --> 28:15.735
(Vlado) I dance to become someone eIse.

28:16.570 --> 28:21.407
(Jacob) They aIways think that we are just
a bunch of kids with no direction,

28:21.533 --> 28:24.744
but what we do is very hard.
We make it Iook easy.

28:24.870 --> 28:28.164
You spin and your equilibrium is off
and you stand up,

28:28.290 --> 28:31.834
and aII you have to reIy on
is how well you know your body

28:31.960 --> 28:35.630
and you place your two feet on the floor,
finding your horizon within yourself.

28:35.756 --> 28:37.507
- Wow.
- Hey.

28:37.633 --> 28:39.467
- This is quite the setup.
- Thanks.

28:39.593 --> 28:41.761
I collect footage of dancers who inspire me.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.181
Clearly. (Laughs)

28:45.307 --> 28:47.809
What are you gonna do with it all?

28:48.685 --> 28:51.396
l don't know. Nothing.
I just play around with it.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.441

Check this out... Check...

29:02.741 --> 29:04.534
..become someone eIse.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.244
We were born...

29:06.370 --> 29:08.037
b-b-born from a boombox.

29:08.163 --> 29:11.082
- I had no idea.
- They're amazing, aren't they?

29:11.458 --> 29:12.917
I mean you.

29:14.962 --> 29:17.171
You're a film-maker.

29:18.132 --> 29:20.591
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, I...

29:20.717 --> 29:22.427
usually don't show people this stuff.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.513
It's just me.

29:28.517 --> 29:30.685
All right.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.645
- You're gonna show me?
- Yeah.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.772
OK.

- Promise not to laugh?
- Oh, I promise.

29:38.152 --> 29:40.528
..or to choose a hobby,
or something Iike that.

29:40.654 --> 29:43.990
lt's another thing for that thing
to choose you.

- Raptor!
- Yes!

30:00.507 --> 30:01.799
Whoo!

30:04.344 --> 30:06.262
How do you guys even do that?

30:07.639 --> 30:08.848
We can read each other's minds.

30:08.974 --> 30:12.143
Aw, you guys are so cute.
How long have you been dating?

30:12.269 --> 30:14.604
- Oh. No, no, no. It's not like that.
- (Phone rings)

30:14.730 --> 30:16.939
We're just...friends.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.232
(Clears throat) No.

30:18.358 --> 30:22.528
- Correction, everyone. We're best friends.
- (Both) Aw.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.072
Anyway, sorry, guys,
I have to go, I'm in a rush.

30:25.199 --> 30:28.951
- You're leaving? We just started.
- I'll call you later, though. Have fun.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.453
You guys lost.

30:30.579 --> 30:32.288
(Girls) Whatever!

30:33.248 --> 30:34.749
Uh... OK...

30:36.335 --> 30:37.543
Gotcha.

30:41.840 --> 30:45.384
Oh, wow. lt's so obvious,
it makes so much sense now.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.762
- What?
- You're totally in love with him, aren't you?

30:47.888 --> 30:50.723
- No! No, no, no. It's...
- Yes, yes, yes.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.517
..not like that, we're just...

30:52.643 --> 30:56.562
Like, one of those, we grew up together.
No, that would be really weird.

30:57.523 --> 30:58.731
Um... (Clears throat)

30:58.857 --> 31:00.149
I think it's your turn.

31:00.275 --> 31:01.317
- So...
- Me?

31:01.443 --> 31:03.402
Yeah, you're up. You're up.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.907
- OK.
- You go first.

31:10.118 --> 31:13.120
Um... Squirrel. Kangaroo?

31:14.873 --> 31:16.082
Keep trying.

31:20.420 --> 31:24.006
Hey. Look who's up early now.

31:25.092 --> 31:27.385
Actually, I haven't been to sleep yet.

31:28.470 --> 31:30.888
- Can I join you?
- Sure.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.725
- What are you looking at?
- l come out here to listen.

31:36.603 --> 31:39.063
The river, the traffic, the birds.

31:40.524 --> 31:43.234
Make me feel like
I'm part of something bigger.

31:43.360 --> 31:47.280
Traffic makes you feel like
you're a part of something bigger?

31:47.406 --> 31:49.073
That is deep.

31:49.199 --> 31:51.659
Like I said, I've been up all night.

31:54.288 --> 31:58.791
So I've been thinking about your video
from last night.

31:58.917 --> 32:02.795
Like, l think you should finish it.
And you should show it to people.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.341
- Yeah, I don't know about that.
- Clearly you love it, right?

32:08.343 --> 32:11.470
Look at you, you've been up all night
and you're like...

32:11.597 --> 32:14.724
l don't know,
you're glowing or something.

32:14.850 --> 32:16.601
Glowing? (Laughs)

32:18.812 --> 32:20.605
I see a glow.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.532
We should get to Red Hook.

32:32.534 --> 32:33.951

the Pirates!

37:01.261 --> 37:04.096
(Crowd chants) Pirates! Pirates! Pirates!

37:10.729 --> 37:12.980
(Luke) No, no, no.
(Twin 1 ) Yeah. Yeah!

37:13.106 --> 37:17.234
Now it's time for you to be in front
of the camera, my good-looking Pirate.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.278
Do you want some make-up, baby?

37:19.404 --> 37:21.405
(Laughter)

37:22.115 --> 37:25.492
- (Natalie) So, Captain Luke...
- Gimme the camera.

37:25.619 --> 37:28.287
- (Twins) No, no, no.
- It's not that easy on this side, huh?

37:28.413 --> 37:31.665
- It's uncomfortable.
- (Luke) Yeah, why don't you keep walking?

37:31.791 --> 37:34.209
- (Jason) Oh, look at this guy.
- (Natalie laughs)

37:34.336 --> 37:36.253
What do you love about dance?

37:36.379 --> 37:41.508
l don't know. Dance music,
it's just always been there for me, I guess.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.263
(Natalie) Is that it?

37:47.390 --> 37:49.266
What? (Laughs)

37:49.392 --> 37:51.268
(Laughs) I know you can do better than that.

37:51.394 --> 37:53.270
- Come on.
- All right.

37:54.064 --> 37:55.981
My parents used to be dancers.

37:56.107 --> 37:59.026
And they started this place
for people like them,

37:59.152 --> 38:01.820
but that didn't just want to be
backup dancers.

38:03.031 --> 38:06.700
You know, do their own thing,
build their own respect.

38:07.452 --> 38:11.705
l thought that was cool, so l wanted
to carry on the tradition, in my own way,

38:11.831 --> 38:13.832
but for them, you know?

38:15.293 --> 38:19.254
So what do they think of you
turning this place into a madhouse?

38:21.841 --> 38:23.842
They never got to see it.

38:30.183 --> 38:31.475
I'm so sorry.

38:31.601 --> 38:34.103
No, don't be. It's OK.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.481
So that's why you're
so devoted to this place,

38:37.607 --> 38:39.149
carrying on what your parents wanted?

38:39.275 --> 38:41.860
Family is family, you know?

38:41.987 --> 38:44.488
The Vault used to be their life,
and now it's mine.

38:45.865 --> 38:48.367
It's amazing what we do for family
sometimes.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.160
So, tell me about your parents.

38:50.286 --> 38:51.412
(Laughs)

38:51.538 --> 38:53.789
They split up a while back.

38:53.915 --> 38:58.419
And me and my older brother, we were sort
of the dice that got rolled between them.

38:58.545 --> 39:00.170
Where's your brother now?

39:00.296 --> 39:03.632
We're still close.
I mean, he pretty much raised me.

39:03.758 --> 39:06.218
So I owe him everything.

39:10.181 --> 39:14.560
So, Tarantino, are you planning on
blackmailing us with all that footage?

39:14.686 --> 39:16.103
No.

39:16.229 --> 39:17.688
Just you.

39:29.367 --> 39:33.328
Hi. So, I'm sorry for being late, OK?
l won't...

39:33.455 --> 39:35.664
Oh! I'm so sorry.

39:35.790 --> 39:38.083
I thought you were somebody else.
I'm sorry.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.211
- OK...
- (Girls chatting)

39:41.337 --> 39:43.672
- Do you know that trick when they take...
- Really?

39:43.798 --> 39:47.134
They kinda look alike,
l think they're twins.

39:47.260 --> 39:50.054
Camille! What's going on?
I thought we had lunch.

39:50.180 --> 39:51.680
Is it lunch time?

39:51.806 --> 39:53.098
Whoa! Um...

39:53.224 --> 39:56.435
Wow, we got so carried away
with the costumes, I lost track of time.

39:56.561 --> 39:58.062
Costumes for what?

39:58.188 --> 40:02.441
It's for the dorm Halloween party. People
plan their costumes like all semester.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.902
All right. So what are we going to go as?

40:05.028 --> 40:06.195
Oh, um...

40:06.321 --> 40:07.821
Well, actually...

40:07.947 --> 40:09.990
I tried calling you but you didn't pick up,

40:10.116 --> 40:13.786
so Kristin and I are gonna be
the Olsen Twins.

40:16.498 --> 40:18.290
Wait, wait, wait. Kristin?

40:19.918 --> 40:21.335
Kristin?

40:21.461 --> 40:23.545
Camille, Kristin?

40:24.589 --> 40:26.673
What about Moose?

40:27.592 --> 40:29.593
Go ahead, you guys.

40:31.888 --> 40:34.598
You haven't exactly been around lately.

40:34.724 --> 40:37.726
I mean, I couldn't wait forever.

40:39.229 --> 40:42.106
OK, well, hey, Camille,
look, I'm here now.

40:45.401 --> 40:47.152
Come on, what do you say?

40:47.278 --> 40:50.489
You know you're gonna have
way more fun with me than...

40:50.615 --> 40:51.740
Kristin.

40:53.076 --> 40:55.536
Are you asking me to the dance?

40:58.123 --> 40:59.832
(Scoffs)

40:59.958 --> 41:04.753
Camillian? You know that I was born
to be the Ashley to your Mary-Kate.

41:04.879 --> 41:07.172
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.926
OK, OK, fine.

41:11.052 --> 41:13.428
- I'll cancel with Kristin.
- Yes!

41:14.305 --> 41:15.389
I'll see you later.

41:15.515 --> 41:17.891
Guess I'll see you later, then.
Get back to your frie...

41:18.017 --> 41:22.062
- Hey, Kristin! In your face!
- Bye.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.940
(Luke) OK, you gotta stop complaining.
(Natalie) I'm sorry.

41:25.066 --> 41:28.068
I just feel ridiculous holding this giant cup.

41:28.194 --> 41:32.656
Whoever said it was OK to have a small,
medium, large and then ginormous?

41:32.782 --> 41:34.116
Hey, look.

41:37.203 --> 41:39.371
- That's you.
- What are you talking about?

41:39.497 --> 41:41.582
- This guy looks exactly like you.
- He doesn't.

41:41.708 --> 41:44.751
He's got a camera popping out of his head,
pretty little cheekbones.

41:44.878 --> 41:48.380
It does not look like me, and I would not
be caught dead with those culture vultures.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.633
I've seen your work,
and you don't fool me.

41:51.759 --> 41:54.678
Yeah, but it's just for fun.
lt's nothing professional.

41:54.804 --> 41:58.056
Well, what if the Pirates
and the rivalry didn't exist?

41:59.058 --> 42:01.101
Wouldn't you give your film-making a shot?

42:01.227 --> 42:03.604
That film academy sounds amazing.

42:03.730 --> 42:07.357
Yeah, but it's not an option,
so l don't think about it.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.401
The World Jam's our main focus.

42:09.527 --> 42:12.946
- OK, so, tell me, then, how do you do it?
- Do what?

42:13.072 --> 42:15.365
Get all your amazing footage.

42:15.491 --> 42:18.785
I don't know. I just try to see things
that people don't normally see.

42:20.455 --> 42:22.456
Show me.

42:23.333 --> 42:24.374
All right, come here.

- What? (Laughs)
- Watch this.

could get eliminated from the World Jam.

50:26.107 --> 50:29.651
Luke, l don't know.
Maybe somebody else should do it.

50:29.777 --> 50:34.114
If we pull this off, we'll kill it on stage.
Julien won't even know what hit him.

50:37.785 --> 50:39.994
Whatever happened between you two?

50:40.121 --> 50:42.038
Me and Julien?

50:42.164 --> 50:45.625
He used to be a Pirate.
We used to be best friends back in the day.

50:45.751 --> 50:47.752
But as time went on, things changed.

50:47.878 --> 50:49.713
How do you mean, they changed?

50:49.839 --> 50:51.464
We found out he had a gambling problem.

50:51.590 --> 50:56.010
He wound up in debt. He bet against our
house and threw the battle to win the bet.

50:56.137 --> 50:58.138
He threw a battle to win a bet?

50:58.264 --> 51:02.058
The whole house was devastated,
so we had to kick him out.

51:02.184 --> 51:04.018
He's been trying to take us down
ever since.

51:04.145 --> 51:08.148
The crazy thing is, if we don't win
the World Jam he could actually do it.

51:48.814 --> 51:50.815
Hey.

51:51.442 --> 51:54.110
- Welcome home.
- You lied to me.

51:55.070 --> 51:57.989
You told me Luke kicked you out
because he was jealous.

51:58.115 --> 52:00.992
But it wasn't that, was it?
You threw a battle for a bet?

52:01.118 --> 52:04.287
- Natalie...
- Don't! I went in there for you, Julien.

52:04.413 --> 52:06.748
I can't believe you stole that DVD
and put it online.

52:06.874 --> 52:09.834
What are you talking about?
What kind of BS did he say about me now?

52:09.960 --> 52:13.338
Luke was jealous. He wanted to be
the leader, so he kicked me out.

52:13.464 --> 52:15.465
He used me and he kicked me out.

52:21.263 --> 52:23.681
I'm sorry.

52:23.808 --> 52:26.309
We have to stick together,
Natalie, you know that.

52:26.435 --> 52:28.812
I don't like to be lied to.

52:28.938 --> 52:32.857
I just want our house
to win the World Jam. OK?

52:32.983 --> 52:35.568
We have too much in this.
We've worked too hard.

52:35.694 --> 52:38.947
Despite what Mom and Dad say,
it doesn't always have to be about winning.

52:39.073 --> 52:43.117
You're starting to sound like him. You need
to remember whose side you're on.

52:43.244 --> 52:44.869
Friggin' ridiculous!

52:44.995 --> 52:46.913
Luke isn't some monster, Julien.

52:47.039 --> 52:49.791
He's a good guy.
He takes care of the people that he loves.

52:49.917 --> 52:52.418
Who are you going to believe?
Him or your family?

52:52.545 --> 52:54.045
You're going to talk to me about family?

52:54.171 --> 52:57.173
When Luke isn't even related to any of
those dancers, he would never lie to them.

52:57.299 --> 53:01.052
Oh. I'm a liar? What about you?

53:01.178 --> 53:03.137
How do you think your precious Luke

53:03.264 --> 53:06.307
is going to feel when he finds out
that you have been playing him?

53:06.433 --> 53:09.310
Actually, now that I think of it...

53:09.436 --> 53:10.854
you should come clean.

53:10.980 --> 53:13.523
That might be what I need
to throw his game off for World Jam.

53:13.649 --> 53:16.401
Thanks, sis. You really helped me.

53:16.527 --> 53:21.698
You're not putting him out on the streets
over some stupid rivalry.

53:24.285 --> 53:26.286
I will not be part of it.

53:42.011 --> 53:44.637
Jacob. You scared me.

53:44.763 --> 53:47.223
You don't seem like a girl
that's easily scared.

53:51.687 --> 53:53.271
Tell Luke I'm sorry.

53:58.527 --> 54:01.112
You have a choice, you know?

54:04.325 --> 54:05.825
It's not that easy.

54:05.951 --> 54:08.995
The most important decisions in life
are never easy.

54:25.804 --> 54:27.805
(Jason) Dance can reveaI a Iot
about a person,

54:27.932 --> 54:30.642
the way they move,
the way they learn new steps.

54:30.768 --> 54:35.146
l mean, if you're dancing for real, it comes
from the most truthfuI part of your souI.

54:35.272 --> 54:37.732
I dance to express how I feel inside,

54:37.858 --> 54:40.777
whether it's anger, happiness,

54:40.903 --> 54:42.320
loneliness.

54:42.446 --> 54:44.906
Once I found the Vault,
it was like coming home.

54:45.032 --> 54:49.369
This is where I feel safe.
This is where l belong.

54:49.495 --> 54:51.162
This is where my family is.

54:51.288 --> 54:53.164
This place is special. It's our world.

54:53.290 --> 54:56.626
I think, finally,
I had somewhere I could be myself.

54:56.752 --> 55:00.046
People say that you don't
really choose your family. We did.

55:00.172 --> 55:02.924
- If you are one of us, Luke will find you.
- Yeah.

55:47.928 --> 55:51.180
- Luke.
- Why would she just leave like this?

55:51.306 --> 55:55.226
I don't know. But for the moment,
we've got bigger problems than that.

55:56.270 --> 55:58.271
The bank's put our house up for auction.

55:58.397 --> 56:00.481
- What?
- They're selling it.

56:02.276 --> 56:04.902
I'm going to deal with this, all right?

56:06.572 --> 56:08.823
- What the hell, Walter?
- Hey, Luke. How are you? Sit down.

56:08.949 --> 56:10.491
I don't want to sit down.

56:10.617 --> 56:12.201
I understand how hard this must be.

56:12.327 --> 56:14.704
If you can just wait a few days,
we'll have the money.

56:14.830 --> 56:16.622
You're five months behind
on your mortgage.

56:16.749 --> 56:18.332
Unless you catch up with your payments,

56:18.459 --> 56:20.877
I'm afraid there's nothing more
l can do for you.

56:21.003 --> 56:22.754
The warehouse sits on prime property.

56:22.880 --> 56:25.256
The bank is well aware
what it's going to go for at auction.

56:25.382 --> 56:28.551
- I need more time.
- I'll see if I can suspend the foreclosure.

56:28.677 --> 56:30.803
But don't get your hopes up.

56:30.929 --> 56:33.389
They could take
your warehouse today, Luke.

56:33.515 --> 56:36.350
That's not gonna happen
cos it's not for sale.

56:40.147 --> 56:41.898
(Luke) Look what I just got from Natalie.

56:42.024 --> 56:44.066
What does it mean?

56:44.193 --> 56:46.319
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.

56:50.657 --> 56:52.575
- Come with me.
- Who, me?

56:52.701 --> 56:55.244
- Yeah, I need you.
- I have a Halloween party tonight.

56:55.370 --> 56:57.413
I mean, I would, but I can't miss it.

56:57.539 --> 56:59.791
College parties start late.
l'll get you back in time.

56:59.917 --> 57:02.168
I'm supposed to be Ashley Olsen, man.

57:02.294 --> 57:03.377
Ashley Olsen?

57:03.504 --> 57:06.506
Yeah. You know how long it takes
to straighten this hair?

57:06.632 --> 57:08.633
Come on. You're my boy.

57:09.551 --> 57:13.137
It's been a long day, man.
I need a good friend right now.

57:13.889 --> 57:15.306
All right, I got your back.

57:21.313 --> 57:23.272
Oh. Invitations, please.

57:23.398 --> 57:27.902
- Invitations? I got one on my cellphone.
- No invite, no entry.

57:28.028 --> 57:29.612
Can you guys push off, please?

57:29.738 --> 57:32.573
- Just over there.
- My name's right there. It's Jeff Bernstein.

57:32.699 --> 57:34.700
- Check...Mr Bernstein.
- You know what?

57:36.119 --> 57:37.662
Thank you.

57:37.788 --> 57:39.789
Hey, how are you doing?

57:41.333 --> 57:42.792
There's got to be another way.

57:50.759 --> 57:52.552
Let's go.

57:54.096 --> 57:57.265
(Announcer) And now, the broken tango.

57:57.391 --> 57:59.141
Take it away.

57:59.268 --> 58:03.646
(Luke) Look, at this place, Moose. Come on.
(Moose) Where you going? Luke? Luke!

58:27.337 --> 58:29.213
(♪ Jazmine Sullivan:
Bust Your Windows)

58:47.566 --> 58:49.567
- Luke.
- I got you.

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:03.432
Come with me.

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:12.066
(Phone rings)

01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:13.526
(Chatter)

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:20.449
Hey, Camille, we're all ready for the party.
You coming?

01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:23.744
l'm gonna meet you guys there.
Moose'll be here like any minute.

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:26.956
Giddy up, girl! Yee-ha!

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:33.129
I got something for you.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.716
I hope you like it.

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:38.509
Your film?

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.512
- You did it?
- Yeah.

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:42.763
Luke.

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:45.766
I'm so happy you finished it.

01:00:55.027 --> 01:00:56.944
Let's get out of here.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:01:00.156
- No one can see us. We're fine.
- No, l mean let's leave.

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:04.035
We could go anywhere. California, even.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:06.912
Come on, you can go to film school.
We can start fresh.

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:10.708
(He sighs)

01:01:13.879 --> 01:01:17.590
Luke. I'm so glad you made it.

01:01:18.592 --> 01:01:23.471
You know, l was a little concerned
that you wouldn't get the invitation in time.

01:01:23.597 --> 01:01:26.515
- What are you doing here?
- Julien, you invited him?

01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:30.186
What? I just wanted to invite him
to come celebrate the birthday

01:01:30.312 --> 01:01:32.938
of my amazing and lovely sister.

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:36.650
He's... He's joking, right?

01:01:36.777 --> 01:01:38.402
Wow.

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:41.447
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry?

01:01:41.573 --> 01:01:43.741
- This was all a lie, wasn't it?
- Yes, it was.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:46.160
- Shut up, Julien.
- Why? It was.

01:01:46.787 --> 01:01:50.414
Listen, at first it was,
and then I got to know you, OK?

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.166
And I...

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:53.751
I started to fall for you.

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:56.295
And that was real,
that's why I had to leave.

01:01:57.798 --> 01:01:59.840
I'm... I'm so sorry.

01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:03.177
- Please tell me you believe me.
- Don't touch me.

01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:06.055
Luke, you...

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:11.769
- You don't need to deal with...
- Don't, Julien!

01:02:12.813 --> 01:02:14.313
Don't worry about him. He's a loser.

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:17.399
Natalie, are you really
getting mad about that?

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:31.163
Camille.

01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:35.000
- Camille, I thought that you...
- I'm over it.

01:02:35.127 --> 01:02:37.253
You clearly have better things to do.

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:40.464
- No, Camille, it's not like that.
- (Sighs)

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:43.300
- Come on, I got caught up.
- Great. Thanks.

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:46.137
I... I've been dancing.

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:52.601
Before school, during school and after.

01:02:54.146 --> 01:02:59.692
So you've been lying to me
and ditching me for some secret life?

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:04.029
I mean, you could have at least told me.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:10.452
But I guess I'm not important enough
in your new cool life to know.

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:15.207
I should have just told you. I know.

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:17.042
But I'm sorry, OK?

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:21.964
And it's all over now.

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:25.259
You're right. It's over now.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.572
- Luke. Luke, Luke.
- What the hell?

01:03:46.698 --> 01:03:49.200
- Hey, man, this is bullshit.
- (Jason) We tried to stop them,

01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:51.035
but there was nothing we could do.

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:53.204
(Luke) We gotta get in there!
They can't do this to us!

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:55.372
Luke! Hey.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.374
I grabbed as much as I could.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.418
It's Julien.

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:02.796
- Julien's trying to buy the house.
- So what are we going to do now?

01:04:02.923 --> 01:04:05.716
Can't you see? We're finished.

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:08.177
But the World Jam is just around the corner.

01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:11.472
- But if we have nowhere to rehearse...
- We have nowhere to sleep.

01:04:11.598 --> 01:04:15.267
We're fooling ourselves,
thinking this place was going to last.

01:04:16.311 --> 01:04:17.978
I'm out.

01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:22.566
Anyone else?

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:37.122
Hey, it's not your fault.
Julien started this.

01:04:37.249 --> 01:04:39.250
You guys deserve better than this.

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:42.211
There's nothing more I can do.
l screwed up.

01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:44.755
The Pirates are done.

01:05:07.279 --> 01:05:08.279
We tried.

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:06.397
Hi.

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:12.277
So, on a scale of one to ten...

01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:17.783
how much do you hate me?

01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:19.910
I don't hate you, Moose.

01:07:21.329 --> 01:07:22.454
I miss you.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:28.794
And what's worse,
feeling like you don't miss me at all.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.630
I don't even matter to you any more.

01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:37.136
We spent all senior year
talking about NYU,

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:41.056
the real world, facing it together.

01:07:43.143 --> 01:07:45.060
What changed?

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:51.442
You're my best friend
in the whole wide world, Camille.

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:56.447
And I never want to let that go.

01:08:03.204 --> 01:08:06.540
My mom just sent this in the mail.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.296

Oh, wow.

but...

01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:38.529

l miss you more.

What?

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:58.550
Are you serious? No, back of the line.

01:08:58.676 --> 01:09:00.469
Just one second, little girl. One moment.

01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:02.595
- l'm sorry.
- Hey, can you turn that song up a bit?

01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:04.805
Do I look like a jukebox to you, pal?

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.350
Um...

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:08.435
How about five bucks?

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:11.688
- Give me that. I'll be right back.
- OK.

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:13.148
(Music gets louder)

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:14.524
(They laugh)

01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:16.443
- Oh, my gosh.
- MSA freshmen year. We met...

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:17.819
(Both) To this song!

01:09:17.946 --> 01:09:20.613
- This is ridiculous.
- (Moose) Remember the choreography?

01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:23.951
- Step forward... Come on, let's try it.
- No, not a chance.

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:25.993
Dance with him! Please!

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.580
- Go.
- You heard the kid. Come on.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.167
All right.

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:35.587
(♪ I Won't Dance)

01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:38.090
Moose, stop! Oh, my gosh!

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:42.010
OK, not in public.

01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:44.720
I'm sorry.

01:09:44.846 --> 01:09:46.848
I'm not doing this.

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:49.393
Whoa! (Laughs)

01:09:50.395 --> 01:09:52.395
Moose!

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:55.232
Hey!

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:57.359
Give me my hat back!

01:10:20.508 --> 01:10:21.550
Whoo!

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.602
What are you doing? Get out of here!

01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:34.396
Oh, man, you know what?
I'm gonna squirt you.

01:10:34.522 --> 01:10:37.524
I'm gonna squirt you! Get out of here!

01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:42.029
- Get outta here!
- Hey!

01:10:42.155 --> 01:10:43.488
I'm sorry.

01:10:57.045 --> 01:10:58.962
Come on! Come on! Get outta here.

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:02.633
- Come on, gimme your scooter, kid.
- Hey, that's my scooter!

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:06.053
You dented it, you freak!

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:38.335
(She laughs, he cheers)

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:41.088
Oh, my gosh,
you have leaves all over you.

01:11:42.215 --> 01:11:43.507
Oh, wow.

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:46.510
(They sigh)

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:50.722
You can never give it up.
You were born to dance.

01:11:50.848 --> 01:11:53.809
Give it up. You suck!

01:11:54.435 --> 01:11:55.852
Really?

01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:58.563
- Don't listen to them.
- (Laughs)

01:11:59.899 --> 01:12:03.110
- l know, but you gave it up.
- Yeah, cos I'm not like you.

01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:07.114
l'm a good dancer,
but, Moose, you're a great dancer.

01:12:09.117 --> 01:12:13.870
- My parents gave up everything...
- So you wouldn't have to. I know, I know.

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:15.497
We can figure this out.

01:12:15.623 --> 01:12:17.624
Together.

01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:20.627
OK.

01:12:21.421 --> 01:12:23.338
(Makes explosive sound)

01:12:23.464 --> 01:12:26.591
- OK.
- Come on. Like my new hat?

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:29.511
Hey, Vince,
I need a coffee on table eight.

01:12:30.722 --> 01:12:31.680
Everything all right?

01:12:31.806 --> 01:12:33.807
What do I have to do to get a menu here?

01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:36.309
- What are you doing here?
- I have two things to say to you.

01:12:36.436 --> 01:12:37.978
I'll have an egg salad sandwich,

01:12:38.104 --> 01:12:40.397
and I still think we can win the World Jam
and get the house back.

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:42.482
I'm out of egg salad sandwiches
and you're out of your mind.

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:45.652
- l thought that's why you liked me.
- You're crazy. We have nobody left.

01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:48.613
But I'm here. Means we got one back.

01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:53.618
Luke, you're the only one that can get
everybody back together to save your house.

01:12:53.745 --> 01:12:56.329
- The Pirates just need your leadership.
- They don't need me.

01:12:56.456 --> 01:12:58.415
I took what my parents gave me
and threw it away.

01:12:58.541 --> 01:12:59.916
You don't know what you've done.

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:03.712
Luke, you gave these people a place
where they can live out their dreams.

01:13:03.838 --> 01:13:06.006
- Sit down, man.
- Dude, I got tables to work.

01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:08.091
No, no, no, just take a seat.

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:11.887
- This better be quick.
- You never asked why I wanted to dance.

01:13:12.013 --> 01:13:13.722
You want to know why?

01:13:13.848 --> 01:13:16.475
l dance
because dance can change things.

01:13:18.019 --> 01:13:22.189
One move can set
a whole generation free, like Elvis.

01:13:23.566 --> 01:13:24.483
Uh-huh.

01:13:24.609 --> 01:13:27.861
One move can make you believe there's
something more. Remember this one?

01:13:31.449 --> 01:13:32.365
Ow!

01:13:32.492 --> 01:13:34.826
Moose, sit down before
you make a fool out of both of us.

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:41.041
And some moves...

01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:44.085
can give a skinny, curly-haired kid...

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:48.882
that just wants to dance...

01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:54.346
some...some hope.

01:13:57.517 --> 01:13:59.518
Hope that he's actually special.

01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:03.271
Excuse me! Excuse me! Hello? Coffee?

01:14:03.397 --> 01:14:05.607
Decaf, don't want it. Regular.

01:14:06.984 --> 01:14:09.152
I'm sorry, I can't. I can't do regular.

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:11.321
I tried. It's just not me.

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:15.617
- I've been waiting here for 30 minutes.
- Hey, he can't do regular, the man said.

01:14:15.743 --> 01:14:19.079
Great, Fred Astaire. l didn't pay
for a floorshow. I paid for some coffee.

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:22.916
OK, that's cool, Moose, but how are we
going to get everyone together?

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:25.001
I had to get everybody here somehow.

01:14:27.713 --> 01:14:29.381
Man, did I miss you guys!

01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:31.842
My mornings are way too quiet
without you guys yapping.

01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:36.513
- You see? I told you he would miss us.
- Yeah, OK, OK, you're right.

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:40.267
Look, I know the odds are against us.
We have no house, no routine.

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:42.519
Hell, l don't even know
how we're going to do this.

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:44.855
But I believe in us, and I know you do too.

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:46.606
That's what I'm talking about.

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:51.361
We've come way too far to stop now.
l know we can win this.

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:54.197
(All sing) We be the Pirates!
We be the Pirates!

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:55.574
We be the Pirates!

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:57.826
We still don't have a place to rehearse.

01:14:57.952 --> 01:15:00.954
Don't worry about it.
Moose said he found us a place.

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:12.549
Moose!

01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:17.637
- Kido!
- Doggone! There you are!

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:20.432
(Both make explosive sound)

01:15:20.558 --> 01:15:22.934
- What's up?
- I miss you.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.145
I miss you. Come here, give me a hug.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.525
Guys, hey, this is Kido.
We used to dance together in high school.

01:15:30.651 --> 01:15:34.863
Am I missing something? What do these
games have to do with the World Jam?

01:15:34.989 --> 01:15:38.366
You said you needed space, right?
l got you, brother.

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:41.786
- Brother?
- Come on.

01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:44.456
Nice to meet you.

01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:52.130
Come on. This way, watch your step.
You're gonna like this place.

01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:54.507
Just come.

01:15:55.509 --> 01:15:56.593
Da-da!

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.637
See, I told you.

01:15:58.763 --> 01:16:01.431
Whoo-hoo! OK, I like it, man.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.892
(Tick 1 ) I used to love this game
when I was little.

01:16:04.018 --> 01:16:06.019
Who do they belong to?

01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:09.981
Oh, me. I watch them after school
because their parents work here.

01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:12.442
(Tick 1 ) l don't know.
Do you think this is gonna work?

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:15.779
And there's so much junk. There's no room,
and we barely have any dancers.

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:18.156
Yeah, and the Samurai,
they outnumber us two to one.

01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:20.825
- (Buzzer)
- He has a point.

01:16:20.952 --> 01:16:23.036
(Buzzer continues)

01:16:23.162 --> 01:16:24.955
Hold that thought.

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:29.209
Come on.

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:35.256
(♪ J. Cole: Who Dat)

01:16:43.975 --> 01:16:46.893
Oh, my God! MSA Crew!
Long time, no see!

01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:49.938
Kido! You ruined our slow-motion thing!

01:16:52.525 --> 01:16:54.609
Guys, I thought you might need
some extra dancers.

01:16:54.735 --> 01:16:56.945
Pirates, meet the MSA Crew.

01:16:57.071 --> 01:16:59.114
Hey, let's show them what we got.

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:01.992
(Moose) A highly good idea, Kido.

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:03.743
All right, so first up we got,

01:17:03.869 --> 01:17:06.162
we got a floor master, Monster.

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:10.291
(Jason) Yeah, that's tight.

01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:12.377
(Pirates) Whoo!

01:17:13.212 --> 01:17:16.214
We got Cable, the man with no bones.

01:17:17.842 --> 01:17:19.509
Whoo!

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:24.723
Fly, Fly can groove and shake.

01:17:26.058 --> 01:17:27.600
(Wolf-whistling)

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:34.774
The popping tapper, Hair.

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.444
(Cheering, applause)

01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:43.199
Last but not least, Smiles,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:57.088
All right, guys, I think this is gonna work.

01:17:57.214 --> 01:17:59.549
Work? We gonna kick some ass!

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:05.972
(♪ Flo Rida: Club Can't Handle Me)

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:15.398
(Dancers) Whoo!

01:19:02.863 --> 01:19:04.739
Will we win the World Jam?

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:11.079
You may have...

01:19:11.956 --> 01:19:13.248
Hey.

01:19:13.374 --> 01:19:15.041
Hey, yo! Zoltan!

01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:17.627
Hey, machine!
Yo, give me my money back, man.

01:19:32.309 --> 01:19:34.811
Hey, guys, check this out.
This is for the World Jam.

01:19:34.937 --> 01:19:36.855
Imagine these lights on this shirt.

01:19:36.981 --> 01:19:38.606
Oh! Oh!

01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:40.650
Oh God! Oh God!

01:19:43.904 --> 01:19:45.488
(Coughing)

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:47.282
That didn't work.

01:20:03.382 --> 01:20:05.091
(Video game) Game over.

01:20:05.217 --> 01:20:09.512
- I like your dance moves.
- I like your accent.

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:11.806
You like my accent? That's good.

01:20:11.932 --> 01:20:14.058
I like yours.

01:20:15.186 --> 01:20:16.603
I don't have a accent.

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:21.191
(Snoring)

01:20:25.946 --> 01:20:27.280
(Phone ringing)

01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:39.834
(Luke) Carlos. I knew you'd come back.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.961
- We need you, man.
- You need me, huh?

01:20:42.087 --> 01:20:43.713
- Yeah.
- Well, check this out.

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:45.715
I got a message from Julien.

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:48.593
- I've been training with the Samurais, right?
- What?

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:52.138
- They want to offer you a deal.
- Is this a joke?

01:20:52.264 --> 01:20:55.308
If you want the house back,
you can have it back, free and clear.

01:20:55.434 --> 01:20:58.144
- What's the catch?
- Throw the battle.

01:20:58.270 --> 01:21:00.188
- (Laughs) Throw the battle?
- Yeah.

01:21:00.314 --> 01:21:03.608
Can't you see? I'm trying to give you all
a chance to have what you want.

01:21:03.734 --> 01:21:06.319
- How could you do this?
- This is real life, Luke.

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:09.447
When you gonna wake your ass up
and see that?

01:21:09.573 --> 01:21:13.368
It's time to grow up.
The Samurai will win at any cost.

01:21:13.494 --> 01:21:15.620
You need to leave now.

01:21:17.581 --> 01:21:20.208
Think about it. The offer stands.

01:21:21.252 --> 01:21:24.587
Or you can take your chances
at the battle. (Laughs)

01:21:48.279 --> 01:21:50.697
What's up, everybody?

01:21:50.823 --> 01:21:52.615
My name is Grandmaster Caz,

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:56.452
and l'd like to welcome you
to the biggest dance battle on Planet Earth.

01:21:56.578 --> 01:22:01.833

The House of Pirates
versus the House of Samurai.

01:22:41.915 --> 01:22:46.836
And this battle
is the battle you won't forget.
