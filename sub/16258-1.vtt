20:56.839 --> 20:59.467
They're all dirty. I'm down to my last sock.
衣服都脏了 最后一只袜子都没了

20:59.675 --> 21:02.428
Then you'll have to go to the launderette, won't you?
那你就去自助洗衣店 行吧?

21:02.636 --> 21:05.389
What? A launderette? Are you serious?

21:05.556 --> 21:07.229
Of course I am. What's the problem?
是呀 有什么问题?

21:07.391 --> 21:11.988
It's just... You're asking a lot, Clair, okay?
只是... 你要求太多了 克莱尔 知道吗?

21:12.146 --> 21:15.275
I don't do launderettes. Never have done, never will.
我从来不去自助洗衣 以前不会 将来也不会

21:15.441 --> 21:17.114
It's no place for a man like me.
那地方不适合我这样的男人

21:17.318 --> 21:20.538
Exposing your most intimate articles in front of strangers.
怎么能把最私密的物品展露在陌生人面前

21:20.696 --> 21:24.917
- Stop it, you're being ridiculous.  - You know me, Clair. I'm sensitive.

21:29.413 --> 21:33.043
Jack, I've worked very hard getting your script to the right people
杰克 我一直很尽力地把你的手稿给合适的人看

21:33.209 --> 21:36.088
and I'm afraid there's no interest.
恐怕没人有兴趣

21:36.253 --> 21:40.383
I said nothing because I didn't want to disturb you. That's the reality.
我什么都没说是因为不想打扰你写作 但这就是事实

21:40.549 --> 21:42.222
I can't see any other options.
我只能说 你别无选择

21:42.384 --> 21:44.978
It's Humphries or bust.
要么去见汉弗莱斯 要么破产

21:47.056 --> 21:49.980
- I understand.  - Good.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.440
Call and let me know how it goes, darling.
打电话告诉我事情进展 亲爱的

22:03.155 --> 22:09.538
And so it was that I first came to hear the name Harvey Humphries.
这是我第一次听到哈维·汉弗莱斯的名字

22:09.745 --> 22:12.749
I had sat in every head of scripts department in London,
我曾经拜访过伦敦每一家出版社的头儿

22:12.915 --> 22:16.089
listening to these twats full of white wine and arugula,
听这些吃饱喝足了的笨蛋们讲话

22:16.252 --> 22:18.300
but I had never heard of this man.
但我从来没听过这个人的名字

22:18.504 --> 22:21.758
"Harvey Humphries of Humbolt Mews."
"洪堡街的哈维·汉弗莱斯"

22:21.966 --> 22:24.219
I didn't like the sound of it.
我不喜欢这个发音

22:24.385 --> 22:28.435
The name seemed innocent enough, but there was something that jarred.
这个名字看起来很天真 内里却很刺耳

22:28.639 --> 22:32.394
It might be the "Harvey Humphries Humbolt" bit that was worrying me.
可能是"洪堡街的哈维·汉弗莱斯"让我感觉不爽吧

22:32.601 --> 22:35.354
But I had a friend, Garry Gordon in Garrick Street.
不过我有个朋友 住在格里克大街的盖里戈登

22:35.563 --> 22:37.565
And he'd never caused me any problem.
他就从来没让我感到不舒服过

22:37.773 --> 22:39.366
No.
不

22:39.775 --> 22:42.949
It was something stronger than just a repetition of the H.
并不是简单的连续H字头

22:43.112 --> 22:46.207
It was more a sensation of having heard Harvey Humphries
感觉更像是从一个臭名昭彰的角度 

22:46.407 --> 22:50.037
in some unsavory context.
听过哈维·汉弗莱斯的名字

22:51.871 --> 22:53.214
Harvey.
哈维

22:54.748 --> 22:57.092
It was the Harvey.
是那个哈维

23:06.510 --> 23:10.640
Harvey was the middle name of Dr. Hawley Harvey Crippen,

the Yank Who'd spent all night in the basement

Crippen had come from America.

23:23.944 --> 23:26.447
Humphries was going to America within hours
汉弗莱斯在见过我之后

23:26.614 --> 23:28.582
of completing his business with me.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.253
Was Humphries related to Crippen?

23:32.453 --> 23:36.503
Far-fetched as it might seem to others, it was not impossible.
有点牵强 并不是不可能

23:36.707 --> 23:39.176
Crippen was an American. Yes.
克里平是美国人 对

23:39.376 --> 23:40.753
And so was Humphries.
而且汉弗莱斯也是

23:40.961 --> 23:44.591
Surely it was more than a coincidence that a man going to America
一个马上去美国的人会被这个是叫做"死亡年代"的题目所吸引

23:44.798 --> 23:47.722
should be excited by a title like "Decades of Death"
这一切肯定不仅仅是个巧合

23:47.927 --> 23:52.728
and have the middle name of one of the most famous killers of the lot.
而且还和最著名凶手的中间名一样

23:55.100 --> 23:56.977
No.
不

23:57.895 --> 23:59.363
No, no, no.
不 不 不

23:59.563 --> 24:04.410
Facts like that are beyond the realm of coincidence.
这样的事实绝不仅仅是巧合

24:28.509 --> 24:31.103
Hello? Who's there?

Can you tell her to call Jack back regarding Harvey Humphries?

Okay, okay. Be rational, be rational.

25:09.550 --> 25:13.225
Clair was obviously not in her office, so she must've telephoned you from home.
克莱尔不在办公室 所以她肯定是从家给你打电话的

25:13.429 --> 25:15.648
But as you don't have her private number,
可是因为你没有她的私人号码

25:15.848 --> 25:19.273
and she's ex-directory, there's no way you can call her back.
而且她也不在号码记录上 你没办法给她打回去

25:19.435 --> 25:22.564
I have to trust it was Clair, and that she meant no malice.

25:22.771 --> 25:25.399
After all, she has no reason to wish me any harm.

25:25.566 --> 25:29.821
She had no way of knowing a man related to a murderer.
她不可能认识一个与凶案有关的人

25:29.987 --> 25:33.332
Only a highly suspicious, paranoid cynic...
只有生性多疑 偏执妄想的愤青...

25:33.532 --> 25:36.832
Or someone like me, with an eye for clues and patterns
或是像我一样 有双能发觉蛛丝马迹的慧眼

25:37.036 --> 25:38.879
could possibly connect the dots.
