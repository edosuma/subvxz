00:00.625 --> 00:02.458
Previously on Good Luck Charlie...

00:03.625 --> 00:07.166
The Duncans are going to Hawaii!

00:07.250 --> 00:08.208
What?

00:08.250 --> 00:10.917
- I'm Teddy.
- Aloha, Teddy. I'm Kai.

00:11.417 --> 00:14.083
We missed you yesterday
at the time share presentation.

00:14.166 --> 00:15.625
If you don't attend the one today,

00:15.709 --> 00:17.959
we'll be forced to charge you
for your entire trip.

00:20.709 --> 00:21.834
What are you doing?

00:21.917 --> 00:23.667
Putting a curse on you.

00:24.250 --> 00:26.208
Swimming and jellyfish.

00:26.750 --> 00:27.959
Things keep happening.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.041
Please, God, if you let me live
through this,

00:36.125 --> 00:38.291
I promise I'll do something good.

00:46.208 --> 00:47.125
Charlie?

00:48.083 --> 00:49.208
Charlie?

00:50.125 --> 00:52.500
Charlie? Here, girl!

00:53.458 --> 00:55.250
Come out, come out wherever you are...

00:55.542 --> 00:57.625
oh, before Teddy starts to cry.

00:58.250 --> 00:59.667
- Hey, honey.
- Oh, Dad!

01:00.375 --> 01:02.458
- What's up?
- Oh. Oh, nothing.

01:02.542 --> 01:04.542
Just a... just a quick plant inspection.

01:04.625 --> 01:06.291
Yep, ficus.

01:08.250 --> 01:10.333
Teddy, you okay?

01:10.417 --> 01:12.792
I'm fine.

01:12.875 --> 01:16.583
So, have you seen, uh, anyone
around the hotel from the family,

01:16.667 --> 01:18.458
you know, kid-wise?

01:18.542 --> 01:19.583
You've already seen me,

01:19.667 --> 01:21.917
so I guess it'd have to be one
of the others

01:22.000 --> 01:26.083
like PJ, or Gabe, or... Charlie.

01:27.333 --> 01:28.625
Did you hit your head again?

01:29.250 --> 01:30.875
Did you hit yours?

01:31.750 --> 01:33.125
What's with all the questions?

01:41.166 --> 01:44.250
Oh, hold on, hold on.
Here you go, sweetie.

01:44.375 --> 01:46.583
- You need to wear one of these.
- Why?

01:46.667 --> 01:48.417
Because we don't want you to get lost.

01:48.500 --> 01:51.834

Come on, PJ, I need your list of fears.

02:50.959 --> 02:51.709
Don't rush me.

02:51.792 --> 02:54.875
Oh, that reminds me, number 27, "Being...

02:55.417 --> 02:56.333
how do you spell "rushed"?

02:56.417 --> 02:58.875
Gimme that.

02:59.959 --> 03:01.834
"Things PJ'S afraid of.

03:01.917 --> 03:03.792
Clowns, heights, falling,

03:03.875 --> 03:05.917
spiders, unicorns,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.291
trolls, ogres."

03:09.041 --> 03:11.583
Okay, how about we start with things
that actually exist?

03:11.667 --> 03:12.792
Good idea.

03:13.583 --> 03:15.500
Where you gonna find an ogre in Hawaii?

03:18.792 --> 03:21.417
Okay, item number one.

03:22.208 --> 03:24.750
- Gabe: You ready?
- Yeah, I think so.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.750
Hiya, PJ.

03:32.834 --> 03:34.583
How you doing?

03:35.500 --> 03:36.542
Fine.

03:37.917 --> 03:39.041
Oh.

03:39.709 --> 03:41.625
Don't be afraid.

03:41.709 --> 03:43.625
Allow me to introduce myself.

03:44.166 --> 03:46.792
I'm not scary, the clown.

03:49.333 --> 03:51.625
Oh, you... you look a little sweaty.

03:51.709 --> 03:53.917
Here, try my handkerchief.

03:56.583 --> 03:57.709
Yeah.

03:59.166 --> 04:01.875
Make it stop. Make it stop!

04:05.333 --> 04:07.709
Oh, this is gonna take a while.

04:14.166 --> 04:15.583
Well, thank you anyway.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.542
Whoa, honey! What happened?

04:21.625 --> 04:23.709
Remember that curse
I was telling you about?

04:23.792 --> 04:25.917
- That's what happened.
- What are you talking about?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.417
Oh, come here.
I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

04:28.834 --> 04:31.583
Okay, I was on the putting green
with Charlie

04:31.667 --> 04:34.250
when I stepped on sacred ground
and got cursed.

04:34.625 --> 04:37.500
Then, I danced on sacred ground

04:37.583 --> 04:39.125
and got the rest of the family cursed.

04:40.250 --> 04:41.959
Still not hearing about the giant neck.

04:43.208 --> 04:47.083
Okay, then I decided to go
for a relaxing swim with jellyfish.

04:47.417 --> 04:48.834
To cover the welts, I put on a lei,

04:48.917 --> 04:51.208
only to discover that I'm allergic
to the plumeria flower.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.750
That's how I got a giant neck.

04:53.583 --> 04:55.250
Wait... Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

04:55.333 --> 04:57.750
All of this, is because of a curse?

04:57.834 --> 04:59.333
Yes, all of it.

04:59.417 --> 05:02.375
Me getting stuck in the elevator,
Teddy getting knocked out,

05:02.458 --> 05:04.375
the boys almost crashing
in a helicopter accident.

05:04.458 --> 05:06.250
You buying that shirt.

05:08.166 --> 05:09.458
What? You don't like this?

05:10.333 --> 05:12.125
I lost the receipt. I can't take it back.

05:12.208 --> 05:13.250
The curse!

05:14.500 --> 05:17.959
Honey, come on.
There is no such thing as a curse.

05:18.500 --> 05:21.166
Everything that's happened
is just a coincidence.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.166
All right, you know what you need?

05:24.250 --> 05:26.250
A size 43 turtleneck?

05:27.959 --> 05:32.458
Honey, what you need
is a nice relaxing day at the spa.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.667
Go pamper yourself.

05:34.750 --> 05:35.959
Get a massage. Get a steam.

05:36.041 --> 05:38.375
Just get all this curse stuff
put out of your head.

05:38.417 --> 05:40.125
Okay, maybe you're right.

05:40.208 --> 05:41.583
I'm overreacting.

05:41.667 --> 05:43.083
Of course you are.

05:44.834 --> 05:46.834
Bob, honey, be honest with me.

05:47.750 --> 05:49.041
How bad do I look?

05:49.834 --> 05:51.583
Every time I look at you,

05:52.041 --> 05:54.750
all I see is my beautiful wife.

05:55.709 --> 05:58.417
Aw. That's nice.

06:01.125 --> 06:02.625
Yeesh.

06:07.792 --> 06:10.500
Okay, I saw this on TV.

06:10.583 --> 06:13.750
If you can walk across these coals,
you won't be afraid of anything.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.583
I don't know.

06:16.083 --> 06:19.125
Hey, come on, you can do it.
It's all about mind control.

06:19.208 --> 06:22.834
Now, take a moment
to empty your mind completely.

06:22.917 --> 06:23.959
Done.

06:25.625 --> 06:27.542
- Already?
- Let me check.

06:28.458 --> 06:29.792
Yeah, done.

06:31.917 --> 06:33.750
Okay, come on.

06:34.250 --> 06:37.333
Now, take a deep breath and focus.

06:37.417 --> 06:39.250
I'm just gonna go find the guy--

06:39.333 --> 06:41.667
Whoo! Whoo!

06:42.583 --> 06:43.875
I did it.

06:44.291 --> 06:45.917
PJ, the coals weren't lit.

06:46.375 --> 06:49.000
Lit? Like fire lit?

06:50.250 --> 06:53.041
Yeah, you're supposed
to walk across hot coals.

06:53.125 --> 06:54.500
But that would hurt.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.709
And you know I suffer from S.F.S.

06:56.792 --> 06:59.583
- S.F.S.?
- Sensitive Foot Syndrome.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.792
It's real, Gabe.

07:04.875 --> 07:06.917
Why do you think I never played hopscotch?

07:12.500 --> 07:14.417
Oh, excuse me, ma'am, have you seen--

07:15.792 --> 07:17.000
Oh!

07:18.542 --> 07:19.709
Mom?

07:20.709 --> 07:22.875
- What happened?
- Oh.

07:22.959 --> 07:25.041
Full body massage.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.208
Turns out the massage oil
had plumeria in it.

07:28.917 --> 07:30.750
Doctor says I'm gonna be fine.

07:31.166 --> 07:32.333
Is it bad?

07:36.542 --> 07:40.291
No. No. You've never looked more...

07:41.208 --> 07:42.250
What?

07:43.125 --> 07:44.667
That's it. Just more.

07:46.625 --> 07:49.250
Uh, listen, Mom, there's something
that I need to tell you.

07:49.959 --> 07:51.583
- It's about Charlie.
- Yeah?

07:51.917 --> 07:53.000
She's...

07:54.000 --> 07:55.250
Doing the hula.

07:59.250 --> 08:01.709
Amy: Oh, that's adorable!

08:01.792 --> 08:03.333
That's the greatest thing I've ever seen.

08:03.792 --> 08:05.542
Hi, Charlie!

08:19.458 --> 08:22.792
Welcome to the opportunity of a lifetime.

08:22.875 --> 08:26.041
A chance to own a timeshare of paradise.

08:26.709 --> 08:30.000
Before we begin,
Mr. Duncan, quick question.

08:30.709 --> 08:33.333
I lost the receipt. I can't take it back.

08:33.834 --> 08:35.625
It's not about your shirt.

08:36.125 --> 08:37.792
Is Mrs. Duncan on her way?

08:37.875 --> 08:39.375
Man, I hope not.

08:39.458 --> 08:42.959
If both spouses
aren't at the presentation,

08:43.041 --> 08:46.667
we're going to have to charge you
for your entire trip.

08:50.458 --> 08:53.959
Okay, then I will be right back
with my lovely wife.

08:55.250 --> 08:56.917
Or somebody else.

09:19.917 --> 09:21.834
Quick favor.

09:21.917 --> 09:23.500
I need you to pretend to be mom.

09:23.750 --> 09:26.250
Dad, really bad time to get super weird.

09:26.333 --> 09:29.500
Uh, I just found out that my wife

09:29.583 --> 09:31.166
has to be at the timeshare presentation.

09:31.500 --> 09:34.500
Obviously, I can't take mom. Please.

09:34.583 --> 09:37.333
This is an emergency.

09:40.166 --> 09:42.166
All right, fine, just give me a minute.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.375
- Hey.
- Oh.

09:46.041 --> 09:47.375
Ready for our date?

09:47.500 --> 09:50.583
Um, actually,
I have one more slight delay.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.333
I have to help my dad with something.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.875
Teddy, I'm starting to think
you don't wanna hang out with me.

09:54.959 --> 09:57.542
No, no, no. No, I totally do.
It's not gonna take long.

09:57.625 --> 09:59.917
I'll just meet you on the beach
in an hour?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.458
I'll be there.

10:01.542 --> 10:02.417
Great.

10:06.208 --> 10:08.333
- Really gotta go.
- Don't rush me. I'm coming.

10:09.834 --> 10:12.959
Wow, you are gonna be great as your mom.

10:19.333 --> 10:21.959
Hey, what are we doing up here?

10:22.041 --> 10:23.542
You're gonna overcome your fear of heights

10:23.625 --> 10:26.166
by jumping off this cliff
into the water below.

10:28.291 --> 10:30.709
Whoa! Are you crazy?

10:32.792 --> 10:33.959
People do it all the time.

10:34.041 --> 10:36.417
Yeah, but those people are professionals!

10:36.834 --> 10:38.625
Come on, there's nothing to be afraid of.

10:39.583 --> 10:41.625
He's right, PJ,
it's gonna be okay.

10:41.709 --> 10:42.834
Just jump.

10:44.834 --> 10:48.417
Stop! Are you crazy?
Do you wanna get yourself killed?

10:50.625 --> 10:52.500
PJ, empty your mind.

10:52.583 --> 10:54.667
Quiet. I think he can hear us.

10:57.083 --> 10:58.750
Come on, you can do it.

11:03.667 --> 11:04.834
I don't think so, Gabe.

11:05.542 --> 11:08.208
Maybe I should start
with something smaller, or...

11:20.709 --> 11:21.792
PJ?

11:23.083 --> 11:24.166
PJ!

11:25.417 --> 11:26.500
Yeah?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.208
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be down there.

11:29.291 --> 11:31.750
Well, luckily,
there was a little ledge, see?

11:31.834 --> 11:34.250
And, uh, some steps, see?

11:35.583 --> 11:36.917
So you jumped four feet?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.917
And what a rush!

11:39.792 --> 11:41.083
Yeah!

11:50.083 --> 11:52.875
Before we begin,
let's get to know each other a little.

11:52.959 --> 11:54.333
Why don't we start with the Duncans?

11:54.875 --> 11:55.709
Of course.

11:55.792 --> 11:57.834
Why don't you stand up
and introduce yourselves?

12:00.250 --> 12:01.875
- Bob.
- Ted-- Amy.

12:02.333 --> 12:03.458
Tedamy.

12:06.083 --> 12:07.208
Tedamy?

12:07.792 --> 12:09.333
That's an interesting name.

12:09.417 --> 12:12.083
Yeah, well, my parents
were really messed up.

12:13.625 --> 12:16.500
So, Bob and Tedamy...

12:17.041 --> 12:18.291
how'd this happen?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.542
Uh...

12:20.625 --> 12:23.000
Uh... oh, he was my exterminator,

12:23.083 --> 12:25.291
and he came over to my apartment

12:25.375 --> 12:27.750
with that giant tank of poison
on his back,

12:27.834 --> 12:30.458
and I just knew that Bobby-boo
was the one for me.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.333
And just so you know,
I don't wear the tank on my back.

12:34.375 --> 12:35.875
No one cares about the details.

12:35.959 --> 12:37.792
- I care.
- Do we have to do this here?

12:40.041 --> 12:43.375
Let's meet someone else, shall we?
You guys.

12:43.792 --> 12:45.959
Man, it feels good to conquer your fears.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.000
PJ, you didn't conquer anything.

12:49.500 --> 12:50.959
You ran from a clown,

12:51.041 --> 12:53.041
walked across slightly warm coals,

12:53.125 --> 12:55.000
and jumped down four feet onto a ledge.

12:55.083 --> 12:56.875
Which I did not know would be there.

12:58.500 --> 13:02.000
PJ, I made a promise
that I would do something good.

13:02.458 --> 13:04.333
And do you know
who I made that promise to?

13:05.166 --> 13:06.959
The guy upstairs.

13:07.041 --> 13:08.333
Bill from Seattle?

13:09.542 --> 13:11.458
He seems like a nice guy,
but what does he care about--

13:11.542 --> 13:14.583
More upstairs! I promised God, PJ!

13:14.667 --> 13:16.041
We gotta keep trying.

13:17.250 --> 13:18.250
Fine.

13:18.333 --> 13:20.250
Well, I have a fear of bedspreads.

13:21.125 --> 13:22.458
Oh, look, I overcame it.

13:24.083 --> 13:25.125
Actually, that's a quilt.

13:25.208 --> 13:27.625
Ooh, this is a quilt? Ooh, ooh!

13:27.709 --> 13:28.875
Whew.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.125
Fine. If you won't do it for yourself,

13:32.208 --> 13:34.667
or me, do it for Charlie.

13:35.875 --> 13:37.166
She looks up to you.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.166
She does?

13:41.542 --> 13:42.709
Did you see that?

13:43.750 --> 13:46.458
Fine. I'll give it one more shot.

13:48.208 --> 13:51.583
Turns out there's plumeria in the shampoo.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.875
Be honest, is it bad?

13:58.959 --> 14:00.917
No, no. You look fine, Mom.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.709
Oh, that's good.

14:04.667 --> 14:06.083
Both: Yeesh.

14:09.417 --> 14:12.542
Remember, it's not about spending money.

14:12.625 --> 14:15.542
Man: It's about spending
your vacation in paradise.

14:15.625 --> 14:17.917
I really need to use the restroom.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.166
We have a break coming up in 90 minutes.

14:21.250 --> 14:24.125
Oh, I can't-- I'm gonna make this simple.

14:24.208 --> 14:26.917
I am going to pee now.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.375
Is it going to be in A, that plant?

14:30.458 --> 14:32.417
B, that trashcan?

14:32.500 --> 14:34.583
Or C, the bathroom in the hallway?

14:34.667 --> 14:36.000
Please go with C.

14:38.333 --> 14:40.375
Fine. You may leave.

14:41.959 --> 14:44.083
Now, let's talk about payment plans.

14:44.166 --> 14:46.041
- Excuse me.
- Yes, Tedamy?

14:46.917 --> 14:49.333
Oh, how much longer are we gonna be here?

14:49.417 --> 14:51.166
Only five and a half more hours.

14:52.208 --> 14:54.417
But I have a date with a really cute boy.

14:55.875 --> 14:57.834
I, I thought you were married.

14:58.625 --> 15:01.125
Well, I'm married, not dead.

15:05.125 --> 15:07.000
Is there any way that I can leave sooner?

15:07.083 --> 15:11.166
Sure, sign that paper
and you are free to go right now.

15:11.250 --> 15:13.125
Great. Okay.

15:14.750 --> 15:15.792
Aloha.

15:17.125 --> 15:21.083
All right,
the ball is now officially rolling.

15:28.208 --> 15:29.834
All I did was go to the bathroom.

15:31.125 --> 15:33.500
We have sold our first timeshare unit.

15:33.583 --> 15:36.667
Congratulations, Bob and Tedamy Duncan!

15:36.750 --> 15:38.333
Should have picked the plant.

15:47.208 --> 15:49.667
- What did you say this was called again?
- Parasailing.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.375
You're gonna go up in the air

15:51.458 --> 15:53.166
- and get a gentle peaceful--
- Up in the air?

15:53.250 --> 15:54.792
You didn't say anything
about up in the air.

15:55.417 --> 15:57.000
What did you think the parachute was for?

15:57.083 --> 16:00.000
Parachute? I thought this was
a very colorful cape.

16:01.125 --> 16:03.125
How do I get out of here?
How do I get out of this thing?

16:03.208 --> 16:04.625
Fine, fine, fine!

16:04.709 --> 16:07.834
If you don't wanna do it,
just signal the guy on the boat like this.

16:07.917 --> 16:10.625
Hey, boat guy! Hey, boat guy!

16:12.917 --> 16:14.333
That was the go signal, wasn't it?

16:14.417 --> 16:16.542
Yep, you might wanna start running.

16:23.125 --> 16:25.291
I'm kind of glad we weren't able to get
together until now,

16:25.375 --> 16:27.500
because this could not be more perfect.

16:27.875 --> 16:29.458
I know. It's beautiful.

16:43.375 --> 16:45.542
Teddy: Kai, this is my brother PJ.

16:45.625 --> 16:47.625
PJ, Kai.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.709
Teddy, what did you do?

16:59.792 --> 17:01.542
I had a date on the one spot on the beach

17:01.625 --> 17:03.500
where idiots fall out of the sky.

17:04.959 --> 17:06.959
I'm talking about the timeshare.

17:07.041 --> 17:08.959
We now own this room.

17:10.542 --> 17:12.250
All I did was sign a piece of paper.

17:12.333 --> 17:14.875
Which bought us a timeshare,

17:14.959 --> 17:16.417
which we can't afford.

17:16.917 --> 17:19.291
You are the worst wife I've ever had.

17:20.667 --> 17:22.625
Well, I'm sorry.
Why don't you make PJ your wife?

17:22.750 --> 17:25.083
Because I'm sure he'd do
a much better job.

17:26.291 --> 17:28.375
Quiet down, people. Quiet!

17:31.333 --> 17:33.250
Why are you wearing a mop?

17:33.375 --> 17:36.125
Because my hair's coming out in clumps.
Wanna see?

17:36.208 --> 17:38.000
No. No. Mop's good.

17:38.083 --> 17:39.166
Mop it up.

17:41.458 --> 17:44.208
Hey, kids, there's something
that I have to tell you.

17:44.291 --> 17:46.583
I know this is gonna sound really crazy,
but here goes.

17:47.625 --> 17:49.125
We've been cursed.

17:49.542 --> 17:51.375
- Cursed?
- Yes.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.625
By Mano, a grumpy Hawaiian man

17:54.709 --> 17:57.375
who does not like it
when you do the robot on sacred ground.

17:59.917 --> 18:02.417
A curse? Come on.

18:02.500 --> 18:06.208
Think about it. Everything bad
started happening after I got us cursed.

18:06.291 --> 18:08.375
- Like the helicopter.
- And mom's fatness.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.500
- And me getting knocked out.
- And mom's baldness.

18:10.583 --> 18:12.125
- The timeshare.
- And mom's grotesqueness.

18:12.208 --> 18:13.250
Okay, got it!

18:14.750 --> 18:17.041
Wait a second. Back up.
What's this about a timeshare?

18:17.625 --> 18:19.166
Go on and tell her, Bobby-boo.

18:20.250 --> 18:21.625
She bought it, not me.

18:21.709 --> 18:22.834
You bought a timeshare?

18:22.917 --> 18:25.625
Okay, the only reason we were
at that stupid thing

18:25.709 --> 18:27.291
was so dad wouldn't have
to pay for the room.

18:27.375 --> 18:29.875
Whoa! But let's not forget
about the curse.

18:29.959 --> 18:33.250
Okay, you not telling me about a timeshare
has nothing to do with a curse.

18:33.333 --> 18:34.417
Or does it?

18:36.959 --> 18:38.792
So that's it? We're cursed forever?

18:38.875 --> 18:40.375
No, we are not.

18:40.458 --> 18:43.291
I got us into this mess,
and now I'm gonna get us out of it.

18:43.667 --> 18:44.583
I'm gonna find Mano,

18:44.667 --> 18:46.291
and have him reverse the curse.

18:48.625 --> 18:49.625
What?

18:49.709 --> 18:52.417
I'll tell mano to reverse the curse.

18:53.792 --> 18:56.542
Looks like you're going
to the doctor again. Plumeria tea.

18:56.625 --> 18:57.959
Oh, nuts.

19:05.166 --> 19:07.125
Hey, excuse me. Are you Mano?

19:07.583 --> 19:08.917
I am Mano.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.333
Yeah, listen,
you put this curse on my family,

19:12.417 --> 19:14.417
and I was just wondering
if you could reverse it.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.875
Curse.

19:16.583 --> 19:19.000
- There is no curse.
- There isn't?

19:19.083 --> 19:21.875
Eh, I just say that to keep
the guests out of the plants.

19:22.208 --> 19:23.375
I'm the gardener.

19:25.250 --> 19:27.250
But what about all the bad stuff
that's happened to us?

19:27.917 --> 19:29.333
Just got lucky, I guess.

19:30.041 --> 19:31.959
My family thinks the curse is real.

19:32.750 --> 19:34.458
Tell them it's not.

19:36.208 --> 19:37.125
I could do that.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.625
Or we could have a little fun.

19:40.208 --> 19:42.500
You say that with an evil look
in your eye.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.166
That gives me pleasure.

19:49.166 --> 19:52.291
The curse removal ceremony now begins.

19:54.375 --> 19:56.291
We are so lucky he does this.

19:56.667 --> 19:58.125
You have no idea.

19:59.834 --> 20:03.208
First, the family, except
for the youngest male,

20:03.291 --> 20:06.667
must circle the mother hopping,
and chanting

20:06.750 --> 20:12.000
"Big and gross, big and gross,
she's the one that's cursed the most."

20:16.208 --> 20:18.083
Um, what should I do?

20:18.208 --> 20:21.250
That's the best part. You do the robot.

20:22.208 --> 20:24.041
Oh, I do a good robot.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.417
♪ Big and gross, big and gross ♪

20:28.500 --> 20:30.750
♪ She's the one that's cursed the most ♪

20:30.834 --> 20:32.917
♪ Big and gross, big and gross ♪

20:33.000 --> 20:35.208
♪ She's the one that's cursed the most ♪

20:35.375 --> 20:37.875
Looking good, guys. Making memories here.

20:37.959 --> 20:40.000
♪ She's the one that's cursed the most ♪

20:40.083 --> 20:42.417
- How come Gabe doesn't have to do this?
- I don't know.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.041
Seems awfully chummy with that Mano guy.

20:44.125 --> 20:46.583
Guys, I think they're just
messing with us.

20:46.667 --> 20:48.709
Oh, Mr. Duncan, there you are.

20:48.792 --> 20:52.041
Uh, we had a little accident
with your timeshare contract

20:52.125 --> 20:53.667
and a tiki torch.

20:53.750 --> 20:56.959
So if you don't mind, we need
to get your wife's signature again.

20:57.458 --> 20:59.333
It's working! Keep going!

20:59.625 --> 21:01.834
♪ Big and gross, big and gross ♪

21:01.917 --> 21:04.166
♪ She's the one that's cursed the most ♪

21:06.625 --> 21:07.750
All right, all right, all right.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.917
I wanna make a toast.
I wanna make a toast.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.125
To the love of my life,

21:12.250 --> 21:14.041
my very beautiful wife Amy.

21:14.125 --> 21:15.583
- Aw.
- Happy anniversary.

21:16.125 --> 21:18.917
And thank you for making me
the luckiest man on Earth.

21:19.458 --> 21:22.625
- I love you.
- Aw. I love you too.

21:23.125 --> 21:24.083
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

21:24.166 --> 21:27.417
Aw, isn't that sweet?

21:27.500 --> 21:30.291
Mom and Dad finally got to have
their romantic moment in Hawaii.

21:31.041 --> 21:33.166
And, uh, as for me, not so much,

21:33.250 --> 21:38.125
but that's okay, because family vacations
are about spending time with family.

21:38.208 --> 21:39.458
Kai: Teddy?

21:39.542 --> 21:40.875
Wanna go for a walk?

21:40.959 --> 21:42.667
Teddy: Here, wrap this up.

21:43.083 --> 21:45.834
What am I supposed to-- Goodbye, Charlie.

21:45.917 --> 21:47.667
All: Good luck, Charlie.

21:48.417 --> 21:49.500
Whatever.

21:54.291 --> 21:56.458
Hi, I'm PJ Duncan.

21:56.959 --> 21:59.875
Tonight, we've had a lot of fun
with the subject of S.F.S.

21:59.959 --> 22:01.250
Sensitive Foot Syndrome.

22:02.125 --> 22:04.542
But Sensitive Foot Syndrome
is a serious problem

22:04.625 --> 22:07.083
that affects almost a dozen people
across the globe.

22:08.083 --> 22:10.667
Come, walk with me. Ow!

22:13.542 --> 22:15.458
It is a particularly sensitive day.

22:16.667 --> 22:20.041
Now you see what me and almost
11 other guys have to go through.

22:20.667 --> 22:23.583
- Hey, what you doing?
- I'm informing people about S.F.S.

22:23.667 --> 22:26.083
PJ, there's no such thing.
It doesn't exist.

22:26.166 --> 22:28.875
Really? Oh, what a relief.
