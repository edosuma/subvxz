00:59.280 --> 01:02.120
-Hello, everyone.
-Hello!

01:02.160 --> 01:04.040
Thank you.

01:05.640 --> 01:10.000
-Greetings, everybody.
-Wow!

01:10.040 --> 01:13.360
-We got a rowdy bunch in!
-They are, they are.

01:13.400 --> 01:16.920
Thank you so much.
Thank you, everybody.

01:16.960 --> 01:19.640
Thank you and welcome.

01:19.680 --> 01:24.160
And, in this edition
of our car show...

01:24.200 --> 01:27.840
Richard steals
some sun cream...

01:27.880 --> 01:30.240

01:37.800 --> 01:38.880
40?

(LAUGHTER)

01:40.360 --> 01:43.000
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:43.040 --> 01:47.400
All that...
All that is to come.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.240
But, we begin with Jaguar.

01:50.280 --> 01:54.600
Now, us three, we love Jags
because they're so...
they're so roguish.

01:54.640 --> 01:58.240
You can take a girl for
dinner if you have a Jag,
and then she will pay.

01:58.280 --> 02:01.280
You could go and stay
with people for the weekend,

02:01.320 --> 02:03.280
help yourself to
all their belongings

02:03.320 --> 02:08.640
and no one will mind because
"you have a Jag". Exactly!

02:08.680 --> 02:10.200
In fact, people expect it.

02:10.240 --> 02:13.200
You have somebody to stay
at your house who owns a Jag,

02:13.240 --> 02:15.920
you've got to accept you're
gonna lose some paintings.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.120
And some cutlery.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.440
The thing is, though, OK,
even though a Jaguar

02:19.480 --> 02:22.560
is an international
get-out-of-jail-free card,

02:22.600 --> 02:25.160
very few people
actually ever buy one.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.960
Who here has got a Jag?
One, two...

02:28.000 --> 02:31.920
Only three people in Britain
drive Jaguars.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.160
It's astonishing.

02:33.200 --> 02:37.000
Yeah, I've actually got
the sales figures here
and they are pretty tragic,

02:37.040 --> 02:39.320
because in the five years
up to 2016,

02:39.360 --> 02:43.680
Jaguar sold
200,000 cars worldwide.

02:43.720 --> 02:47.760
And in the same period,
Audi, Mercedes and even BMW,

02:47.800 --> 02:51.600
each sold over eight million.

02:51.640 --> 02:53.760
It's a staggering statistic,
it really is.

02:53.800 --> 02:57.280
We were talking about this
in the office the other day
and Mr Wilman said,

02:57.320 --> 03:00.560
people don't buy Jags because
they used to break down.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.280
Yeah, but, that's
just not true.

03:02.320 --> 03:03.840
And we decided to prove this

03:03.880 --> 03:07.880
by taking The Grand Tour
this week to Colorado.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.560
(BELL TOLLS)

03:19.640 --> 03:21.560
(BIRDS SCREECHING)

03:26.720 --> 03:31.000
The car I've chosen is,
I think, the best car
Jaguar ever made.

03:31.040 --> 03:36.280
The V8 super-charged XJR.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.040
It's cool without being
Cool Britannia.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.760
It's caddish
without being laddish.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.680
It's...violent
without being vicious.

03:45.720 --> 03:50.240
And it is just the last word
in sophistication.

03:50.280 --> 03:53.680
Hannibal Lecter had one
and that says it all because

03:53.720 --> 03:57.560
the last we saw of him
he was on a plane, scot-free,

03:57.600 --> 04:02.000
eating
a district attorney's head.

04:02.040 --> 04:05.720
Soon I reached
the meeting point,
where I found James,

04:05.760 --> 04:08.920
who'd bought
an XK8 convertible.

04:08.960 --> 04:14.160
Here we are, look.
A big cat near an old dog.

04:26.840 --> 04:29.160
-Greetings, May.
-Moron.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.280
JAMES: It's not a Subaru!

04:31.320 --> 04:34.440
You're supposed to be
upholding the reputation
of the Jag driver.

04:34.480 --> 04:36.680
-Why have you bought that?
-Because it's excellent.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.120
-It isn't.
-It is.

04:38.160 --> 04:41.360
-This was a very poor Jaguar.
-This was a very good Jaguar.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.360
You could go camping
in the wheel arches of it!
They're so high up.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.200
They looked all right when
they were super-charged
and lower but this is...

04:47.240 --> 04:49.840
They didn't work properly
when they were
super-charged and lower

04:49.880 --> 04:51.560
because they had
a terrible ride.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.040
The one thing you get
from a Jag is a nice ride.

04:54.080 --> 04:57.040
You're disconnected from
the world, that's the point.
Anyway...

04:57.080 --> 05:00.000
And those wheels!
There's no "anyway" about it.

05:00.040 --> 05:02.320
That's the best Jag
probably ever made.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.320
-Hmm. No.
-Well, it is.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.480
Tell me what's wrong
with that?

05:06.520 --> 05:08.680
One of the wheels is odd.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.840
Yes, ah, I know exactly
what's happened here.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.120
Previous owner's
had a puncture.

05:17.160 --> 05:21.880
He's simply borrowed a wheel
from another car to use.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.360
-And he's gonna give it back?
-Of course he is.

05:24.400 --> 05:27.120
-Because he drives a Jag.
-Exactly.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.440
And look in here!

05:28.480 --> 05:31.760
It looks as if there's been
a knife fight in the car.

05:31.800 --> 05:35.200
That's because he went
to stay with some friends,
obviously,

05:35.240 --> 05:36.520
thought,
"I'll borrow their cutlery"

05:36.560 --> 05:41.720
tucked it into his trousers
and then he's cut his seats,
that's what's happened.

05:41.760 --> 05:45.800
At this point,
Mr Hammond hoved into view.

05:45.840 --> 05:49.120
-God, is that a Mark X?
-That is a Mark X.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.480
JAMES: That's a properly
villainous Jag.

05:51.520 --> 05:54.440
-That that is a proper Jag.
-Yeah.

05:54.480 --> 05:58.600
Whatever you do, OK,
do not tell him that.

05:58.640 --> 05:59.920
No, no.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.960
-Hammond, you idiot.
-What?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.160
We're supposed to be
upholding the reputation
of Jaguar,

06:04.200 --> 06:07.760
you've brought an antique,
you've brought an old
piece of furniture.

06:07.800 --> 06:11.680
I am celebrating and
revelling in the glories
of Jaguar.

06:11.720 --> 06:15.200
This is 1967 420G.

06:15.240 --> 06:18.960
This front end
started with this car.
That's the Jaguar look.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.040
The forehead lamps,
the narrow grill.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.240
Hammond, seriously.
What is that?

06:23.280 --> 06:25.200
It's a 420G.
This was the favour--

06:25.240 --> 06:28.880
-No, no not that. That.
-This? It's my jacket.

06:28.920 --> 06:32.040
I thought, a bit of style.
We're in Jaguars.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.640
There's no style
in the jacket at all.

06:34.680 --> 06:35.920
It's riddled with style!

06:35.960 --> 06:38.280
Some of your jackets
are terrible, but I can't--

06:38.320 --> 06:42.040
RICHARD: Anyway, this was
favoured by every villainous
bank robber and baddie

06:42.080 --> 06:43.760
in and around England
in the '60s.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.040
-How much did you pay for it?
-£6,500.

06:46.080 --> 06:49.360
-What?
-That is a lot of car for
six-and-a-half grand.

06:49.400 --> 06:52.280
-Look at the size of it!
-Hammond, that is 1,000...

06:52.320 --> 06:55.560
No, wait, £2,500 more

06:55.600 --> 06:58.040
than I paid for
a super-charged Jaguar.

06:58.080 --> 07:02.040
That is Jaguar's
embarrassing attempt to
recapture their own design

07:02.080 --> 07:04.400
that started with this,
the four head-lamps,
the narrow grill.

07:04.440 --> 07:07.520
This is definitive.
Your car is derivative.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.400
JEREMY: And Hammond
wasn't finished there.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.760
Look at the size of this!

07:12.800 --> 07:15.520
Imagine how many
oil paintings, borrowed,
I could get in there.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.840
JAMES: Smells terrible.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.760
-Tool kit.
-Let me have a look.

07:18.800 --> 07:22.720
-That's for opening windows.
-It is, no this is...

07:22.760 --> 07:25.520
Not necessarily for
fixing the car! (LAUGHS)

07:25.560 --> 07:28.600
That's for cutting through
somebody's fence.

07:28.640 --> 07:32.520
This is for undoing
the paintings from the walls.

07:32.560 --> 07:35.800
All the Jaguar toolkit
is just for burglaries.

07:35.840 --> 07:37.560
RICHARD:
It's got a jemmy in it!

07:37.600 --> 07:39.240
(LAUGHTER)

07:46.600 --> 07:51.040
JEREMY: At this point
we set off into the heart
of Colorado,

07:51.080 --> 07:55.160
eager to demonstrate
the magnificence of our cars.

07:58.920 --> 08:03.040
Now it is telling me here
that the traction control
has failed,

08:03.080 --> 08:07.320
the stability control
has failed, and that the
anti-lock brakes have failed.

08:07.360 --> 08:12.560
And that's brilliant, because
Jaguar obviously realised
when they made this car

08:12.600 --> 08:15.240
that drifting would one day
become very popular,

08:15.280 --> 08:18.520
and driver aids like this
would be unwelcome
and unnecessary.

08:18.560 --> 08:22.240
So they were designed
to break, and they have done.

08:27.440 --> 08:32.600
RICHARD: This particular 420G
is from 1967.
Quite well-equipped.

08:32.640 --> 08:36.440
This row of toggle switches
here on the dash,
six of them.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.640
Wiper. Look at that!

08:39.680 --> 08:41.800
Look at... Oh.

08:41.840 --> 08:45.400
Yeah!
That's the wipers there.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.960
And then this is...
They won't turn off now.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.200
This is the fan. That doesn't
do anything at the moment.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.760
These are features.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.440
This is character that has
evolved over the years.

08:56.480 --> 08:58.560
These are the beauty spots,

08:58.600 --> 09:02.080
or the slight squint
to one eye that makes
a person beautiful.

09:02.120 --> 09:06.360
If anything... If anything...
Oh. The glove box has come
open.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.440
I'll close that now.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.920
-(GLOVE BOX OPENS)
-It's done it again.

09:15.520 --> 09:18.520
JAMES: Normally
I'd say at this point,
now we're alone, viewers,

09:18.560 --> 09:21.560
let me talk you through
a couple of things that
aren't right with my car.

09:21.600 --> 09:25.360
I'm afraid I can't do that
because everything in here
works perfectly.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.960
There is, if you look in
the left-hand dial,
which is the rev counter,

09:29.000 --> 09:31.560
there's an engine
warning light on

09:31.600 --> 09:36.360
to remind me that the
engine warning light works,
and that it's there.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.120
When you brake, like that,

09:39.160 --> 09:44.840
the brake pedal
judders for you,
so you know you're braking.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.640
That's brilliant! Why doesn't
everybody do that?

09:50.640 --> 09:52.960
I will give
Hammond's car one thing,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.640
it does give good
rear view mirror.

09:55.680 --> 09:58.080
It looks villainous.

09:58.120 --> 10:03.000
The Kray twins actually had
420s just like Hammond's Jag.

10:03.040 --> 10:06.200
If you're watching this in
America and you don't know
who the Krays are,

10:06.240 --> 10:09.280
they're the reason the Mafia
never got to London.

10:09.320 --> 10:13.760
They were too scared
of the Krays.

10:13.800 --> 10:16.720
Some incredibly strong smells
in this car.

10:16.760 --> 10:19.320
There's a sort of
gluey, resiny smell.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.200
And burning.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.680
Yeah, burning.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.320
(CAR DOOR CREAKS)

10:27.480 --> 10:29.120
It's having a smoke!

10:29.160 --> 10:31.760
It's from the '60s.
Everybody smoked in the '60s.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.200
-It would smoke, it's a Jag.
-That's what's it's...

10:34.240 --> 10:35.480
You have a smoke, mate.

10:35.520 --> 10:38.880
It's seen this nice view
and thought, "I'll have
a pipe and contemplate it."

10:38.920 --> 10:41.560
Like, like a red native.
What are they called?

10:41.600 --> 10:43.200
-Native American?
-Yes, that.

10:45.360 --> 10:48.240
JEREMY: Once Hammond's car
had finished its smoke,

10:48.280 --> 10:50.880
we resumed our
fuss-free journey,

10:50.920 --> 10:53.240
and I got my foot down.

10:56.320 --> 10:59.520
It's still got tons of poke.
Look at that!

10:59.560 --> 11:01.400
Which went well.

11:04.920 --> 11:09.280
It's just not changing gear.
It's... There's neutral.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.880
Right, now it's in,
I think, second.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.440
Jeremy, why are we
going so slowly?

11:14.480 --> 11:18.760
I'll tell you exactly why,
because the only
German part in here,

11:18.800 --> 11:21.840
the Mercedes gearbox,
has gone wrong.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.800
That was a sad lapse of
judgment on Jaguar's part.

11:24.840 --> 11:28.440
Any idiot knows you don't
put German bits in a car.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.120
-Manually changing gear.
-What is wrong with it?

11:31.160 --> 11:35.880
It's selecting a gear
for the moment and
then just sticking with it.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.360
I can't wait for it
to choose reverse.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.800
(LAUGHS)

11:41.840 --> 11:47.320
This problem with shoddy
German engineering couldn't
have come at a worse time,

11:47.360 --> 11:49.840
because we were
now arriving at the location

11:49.880 --> 11:53.280
for Mr Wilman's
first challenge

11:53.320 --> 11:55.600
and I'd have to
fix things sharpish.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.600
RICHARD: Now look.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.480
"Now look" what?

11:59.520 --> 12:01.960
Don't let us distract you
Professor, Doctor.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Listen, I have worked
this out all by my own!

12:05.040 --> 12:09.480
The gearbox has overheated, OK?
So I'm gonna put some
fluid in it.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.840
How much
do you need to put in?

12:11.880 --> 12:14.160
Don't know. How
much do you need to put in?

12:14.200 --> 12:18.760
-Put enough in. Go on.
-Yeah, put some in.

12:18.800 --> 12:22.440

a really, really old drunk
pour himself a Scotch!

is coming out, there it is.

a man operating
at his absolute limit.

at an off-road course,

12:53.480 --> 12:55.640
which Mr Wilman was convinced

12:55.680 --> 13:00.720
would break our
ancient Jaguars into
1,000 pieces.

13:02.800 --> 13:08.360
However, James had worked out
a way to prove him wrong.

13:08.400 --> 13:12.400
OK, are you ready?
In three, two, one, go!

13:14.680 --> 13:19.000
-It's a long car. It takes
a long time to go past.
-That's what it is.

13:19.040 --> 13:22.640
I'd better brake for this
left-hander, change down.

13:22.680 --> 13:24.400
Oh, concentrate!

13:24.440 --> 13:26.640
And approaching the jump.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.960
JEREMY: He may get air here.

13:31.280 --> 13:32.720
There you go.

13:32.760 --> 13:35.000
Know this, if you're
turning over now to watch

13:35.040 --> 13:37.480
Man In A High Castle,
something of that nature,

13:37.520 --> 13:38.880
James is gonna
finish this course.

13:38.920 --> 13:42.360
Which, eventually, he did.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.040
-And...across the line.
-There he is.

13:46.440 --> 13:47.680
RICHARD: Yeah.

13:47.720 --> 13:50.320
JEREMY: James May,
you just set a lap record.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.280
Yes!

13:52.320 --> 13:54.600
The fastest ever lap

13:54.640 --> 13:57.840
in a Jaguar XK8
around this track.

13:57.880 --> 14:01.040
As you can see,
the perfect track day car.

14:01.080 --> 14:07.760
This Jaguar has done a lap
of this very demanding race
circuit, and it's perfect.

14:07.800 --> 14:12.760
JEREMY: Next up was me,
in the tight-fit XJR.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.640
It is quite snug in here.
Look, really.

14:15.680 --> 14:20.720
-There is a problem. If I hit
the top of your head...
-Oh, hang on!

14:20.760 --> 14:22.920
RICHARD:
That's what that's for!

14:22.960 --> 14:25.400
It's a helmet hatch.
That's what it is.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.560
You'll almost certainly
be killed, though.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.120
You know when they take
the top off a boiled egg?

14:30.160 --> 14:35.280
-You do the countdown.
-In three, two, one, go!

14:36.400 --> 14:37.720
(ENGINE REVS)

14:37.760 --> 14:39.560
Yeah, there's some dust.

14:39.600 --> 14:46.240
And there we are!
I have unleashed
385 horsepower!

14:46.280 --> 14:53.120
And I would now demonstrate
that this 17-year-old car had
lost none of that horsepower.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.920
Or any of its
razor-sharp handling.

14:58.520 --> 15:01.680
Oh, yeah. Just feel
the tail going nicely.

15:01.720 --> 15:04.280
Oh, bollocks! It didn't.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.640
I have slightly
got that wrong,

15:06.680 --> 15:11.200
but we can edit that out
and cut to this,
and it looks good.

15:11.240 --> 15:14.400
God, he's all over the place.
Look at that!

15:14.440 --> 15:17.320
What you're watching here
is liquid poetry.

15:17.360 --> 15:20.000
And flick it in!

15:20.040 --> 15:21.840
JAMES: He's completely
messed it up.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.240
RICHARD: Yeah, he's just...
What... What is he doing?

15:25.280 --> 15:28.520
I've had a spin there.
A slight spin has gone.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.160
I'm blind as a bat now.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.560
That's... That's added
to his time quite a lot.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.600
There we go,
speed up again now.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.040
And...

15:36.080 --> 15:38.120
You ready?

15:38.160 --> 15:39.960
...across the line.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.040
1:54.

15:45.080 --> 15:47.920
JEREMY:
But the important thing is,

15:47.960 --> 15:52.680
that's a lap record
for the XJR,
and it's still working.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.000
(DRUM ROLL)

15:54.040 --> 15:58.160
JEREMY: Finally,
it was the turn of Ronnie
and Reggie Hammond.

15:58.200 --> 16:03.800
Here we go.
In three, two, one, go!

16:03.840 --> 16:08.680
Here we go, unleashing
4.2-litre straight-six.

16:08.720 --> 16:12.160
JEREMY: Because Hammond's
50-year-old Jag was a senior
citizen,

16:12.200 --> 16:14.680
we hoped he'd take it easy.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.360
However...

16:16.400 --> 16:18.080
Let's do this properly.
Come on!

16:20.680 --> 16:22.680
JEREMY:
Oh, his boot's come open.

16:22.720 --> 16:27.200
-He hasn't really got the
point of this from the start.
-No. No, he hasn't.

16:27.240 --> 16:30.280
You've got a bit more
than that in you.
I know you have!

16:30.320 --> 16:32.040
You've got more to give me.
Give me more!

16:35.640 --> 16:38.480
JEREMY: Oh, no, look!
Tons of black smoke.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.480
(LAUGHS) Yeah!

16:40.520 --> 16:43.040
Ha-ha-ha! Come on!

16:56.360 --> 16:58.520
RICHARD:
Back at the finish line,

16:58.560 --> 17:00.800
my colleagues were
not impressed  with me.

17:00.840 --> 17:03.400
JAMES: There's oil
everywhere, and coolant.

17:03.440 --> 17:07.040
All you had to do was
go round pretending
it was a bit dramatic

17:07.080 --> 17:09.520
proving that a Jaguar
worked properly
and was durable.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.880
I gave it a bit of the beans
in a corner,
bit of a tail-out.

17:12.920 --> 17:15.720
This lot at home are fooled.
They think I was
trying my hardest.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.520
I pulled a face.
I went like that.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.120
-What did you do?
-Gave it--

17:19.160 --> 17:21.640
And look at the back
of your car.

17:21.680 --> 17:26.600
Smashed rear window.
Boot lid, no other word, off.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.360
Does it actually start?

17:29.480 --> 17:31.720
(ENGINE STRUGGLES)

17:33.120 --> 17:35.320
(METALLIC CLANGING)

17:36.720 --> 17:38.120
(ENGINE OFF)

17:38.160 --> 17:40.960
-I think you threw a rod.
-It's all fixable.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.760
What was that?
What was that "glang" noise?

17:44.800 --> 17:49.880
It could be a rod going
through the side of the wall.
I can fix this.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.760
And sure enough ...

17:52.800 --> 17:58.320
I would have bet my left ear
that Hammond would never be
able to get that Jag going,

17:58.360 --> 18:02.120
and yet, he has!

18:02.160 --> 18:05.640
Turns out the actual damage
was nowhere near as bad
as we thought.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.160
All I had to do,
straighten the boot lid,

18:10.200 --> 18:13.120
top up the water in the
radiator, that did need
doing, that was it.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.760
Yep.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.800
Never noticed the sun roof
before. That's good.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.200
So, there we are,

18:22.240 --> 18:26.240
proof you can go off-road
racing with three Jaguars,

18:26.280 --> 18:30.840
and all of them will survive.

18:30.880 --> 18:34.240
Well, it is just good that
we're back as a three,

18:34.280 --> 18:37.240
with the three cars
running well.

18:48.440 --> 18:50.440
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

18:50.480 --> 18:53.200
I think we
got away with that.
They never noticed.

18:53.240 --> 18:56.000
No, nobody.
Yeah, we're good. We're good.

18:56.040 --> 18:58.960
-Anyway, shh, shh, shh.
-Yeah.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.520
I can't believe,
I simply cannot believe,
how robust those Jags were.

19:03.560 --> 19:07.160
I can, they are tremendously
well-made cars,
they really are.

19:07.200 --> 19:11.480
Swiss watchmakers,
they gasp sometimes when they
look at an old Jag and go,

19:11.520 --> 19:14.040
"I cannot believe
how much perfection
there is in there."

19:14.080 --> 19:16.760
Exactly, and we will
come back to that later on,

19:16.800 --> 19:21.400
but right now it's time
to slide across
an icy puddle of chat

19:21.440 --> 19:23.440
on Conversation Street.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.040
(JAZZ MUSIC)

19:26.080 --> 19:29.360
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

19:29.400 --> 19:31.200
-That hurt?
-Yeah.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.600
Right now,
we begin with this.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.680
You know the fire brigade
these days

19:35.720 --> 19:38.800
have been issued with those
big hydraulic, erm,
poultry shears?

19:38.840 --> 19:40.200
You mean the jaws of life?

19:40.240 --> 19:42.040
-Whatever they're called.
-Jaws of life.

19:42.080 --> 19:47.040
If you give a man a tool
like that, he is going to
use it all the time.

19:47.080 --> 19:51.000
Which means whenever the
fire brigade now turn up at
the most minor car accident,

19:51.040 --> 19:53.040
out they come,
they cut the car's roof off.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.960
-Yeah, they do.
-Are there any firemen here?

19:55.000 --> 19:58.040
No, because they're too busy
out there cutting people's
roofs off. They are!

19:58.080 --> 20:00.480
Loads of them out there.
It is getting out of hand.

20:00.520 --> 20:04.560
There was a story recently,
somebody had a pretty much
brand-new Range Rover Sport,

20:04.600 --> 20:06.080
it had done 400 miles.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.640
They had a bit of a shunt.
I think we've got a picture.

20:08.680 --> 20:11.200
It's broken a headlamp,
but that's about it.

20:11.240 --> 20:15.200
Fire brigade come along and
immediately cut the roof off,
there you go.

20:15.240 --> 20:17.720
-(LAUGHTER)
-I mean, that's made
everything worse!

20:17.760 --> 20:21.000
I can beat that, OK?
Couple of years ago there was
this woman driving along.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.920
There'd been
a minor accident,
she wasn't involved,

20:22.960 --> 20:24.720
but the people who were,
were standing around.

20:24.760 --> 20:27.640
She said, "Do you want to sit
down in the back of my car?"

20:27.680 --> 20:30.880
Fire brigade turn up,
cut the roof off her car.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.000
-What, they...
-There, look!

20:33.040 --> 20:35.240
RICHARD: That hadn't
been in the crash?

20:35.280 --> 20:36.600
They'd gone in
through the doors, said,

20:36.640 --> 20:38.840
"We'll cut the roof off,
easier to get you out."

20:38.880 --> 20:40.440
The doors are working, look!

20:40.480 --> 20:43.360
RICHARD: She was being
a good Samaritan
and that's what she got?

20:43.400 --> 20:47.120
-Do you know they actually
did this to the police?
-Who, the fire brigade?

20:47.160 --> 20:50.280
The police turned up
at the scene of an accident,
a very minor one.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.080
The people were unhurt
but it was raining.

20:52.120 --> 20:55.240
They said, "Would you like to
rest in the police car?"
(LAUGHS)

20:55.280 --> 20:56.720
No, please tell me...
They didn't!

20:56.760 --> 20:59.320
The fire brigade cut the roof
off the police car!

20:59.360 --> 21:01.480
-(LAUGHTER)
-That's gonna escalate.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.560
I think what
happened later on

21:03.600 --> 21:07.400
was the police went in
their convertible police car
round to the fire station

21:07.440 --> 21:11.200
and blew up the fire engine
in a "controlled explosion"
which is what the police do!

21:11.240 --> 21:12.560
It's gonna build!

21:12.600 --> 21:15.520
I kerbed the wheel on my car
the other day and I thought,

21:15.560 --> 21:18.920
"I hope the fire brigade
didn't see me do that.
They'll cut the roof off!"

21:18.960 --> 21:21.920
They wouldn't cut the roof
off your car because
that's only a Golf.

21:21.960 --> 21:25.520
-What they like to do is
cut the roof off a Porsche!
-That's more exciting.

21:25.560 --> 21:28.120
You say at the pub, "I cut
the roof off a Porsche!"

21:28.160 --> 21:30.080
It's better than
a Golf or a Hyundai.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.440
-It's a better story.
-Exactly.

21:31.480 --> 21:32.920
I know why they're doing it.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.680
To be brutally honest,
they're doing it
because they can.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.280
They should take a lesson
from the Queen.

21:37.320 --> 21:40.280
She's been the Queen now
for, what, 65 years?

21:40.320 --> 21:45.200
Now, she has the
constitutional right
and power... (LAUGHS)

21:45.240 --> 21:48.720
(LAUGHTER)

21:48.760 --> 21:52.040
Weirdly this is... this is,
actually their display team.

21:52.080 --> 21:54.080
This bit better go in,

21:54.120 --> 21:57.240
because that's gonna be
un (BEEP) ing editable,
that is!

21:57.280 --> 21:59.280
They should take a lesson
from the Queen.

21:59.320 --> 22:02.080
-She's been in power now,
what, 65 years?
-Yeah.

22:02.120 --> 22:06.360
She has the constitutional
right to declare war on
another country, OK?

22:06.400 --> 22:08.240
She can do that,
and she never has.

22:08.280 --> 22:11.000
How long would you last
before you declared war
if you had the ability?

22:11.040 --> 22:14.320
-I'd give it two days,
and it'd be all-out war.
-Exactly.

22:14.360 --> 22:17.080
"I'm declaring war
on France.
That's what I'm doing."

22:17.120 --> 22:20.160
Well, you would if you could,
that's the problem.
That's why they do it.

22:20.200 --> 22:23.600
I sympathise with the fire
brigade, because I bought
a chainsaw the other day.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.640
-Oh, my God! Are you sure?
-No, I did.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.080
But when you've got
a chainsaw,
you use it for everything.

22:28.120 --> 22:31.360
I was thinking, "I've got to
carve the Sunday joint.
I'll get the chainsaw."

22:31.400 --> 22:34.280
Opening a letter,
get the chainsaw.
Bread, use the chainsaw.

22:34.320 --> 22:37.720
Your eyebrows could do
with a bit of a trim.

22:37.760 --> 22:38.880
(LAUGHTER)

22:38.920 --> 22:41.960
As soon as the show's over,
they're coming off with
a chainsaw.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.760
-You've got it,
so you use one.
-Exactly.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.640
-They've got jaws of life?
-Jaws of life.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.840
They're gonna use it,
and they are doing.

22:47.880 --> 22:51.520
We've got an important
message actually for all
firemen and firemenwomen.

22:51.560 --> 22:53.160
Stop cutting the roofs...

22:53.200 --> 22:55.320
(LAUGHTER)

22:55.360 --> 22:56.680
Sorry!

22:56.720 --> 22:58.120
(LAUGHTER)

22:58.160 --> 22:59.880
I think that's right.
That's right, mate.

22:59.920 --> 23:04.560
-It's equal opportunities,
what's the matter with you?
-It's a modern world.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.200
Stop cutting the roofs off
our cars or we'll come round

23:07.240 --> 23:10.400
and cut the roof off your
painting and decorating van.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.040
(LAUGHTER)

23:12.080 --> 23:13.360
That's covered
the fire brigade.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.880
-Yep.
-Hope we don't need them
any time soon.

23:15.920 --> 23:19.200
So do I, cos we're gonna be
trapped in a car, "Please!"

23:19.240 --> 23:21.720
Aston Martin's launched this.
It's the new Vantage.

23:21.760 --> 23:23.960
-(CROWD MURMURS)
-RICHARD: That looks great.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.560
JEREMY:
Absolutely spectacular.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.600
That actually looks like
the one-off Aston they made
for the Bond film.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.800
Oh, from the back especially.
Have you got a picture of it
from the back?

23:31.840 --> 23:34.360
I mean, that is just
a spectacular-looking thing,

23:34.400 --> 23:39.280
and it's been fitted with
the twin-turbo charged
four-litre V8 from Mercedes.

23:39.320 --> 23:40.840
-The AMG engine.
-Yeah.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.680
And that is just brilliant.

23:42.720 --> 23:46.360
It's the work actually of
the man with the best name
in the motor industry.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.680
No, second best name.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.640
Man with the best name
is Lamborghini's chief
test driver.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.560
-He's called Max Venturi.
-Yeah.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.800
-He's never had sex.
-No, no, no.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.200
-He's young and good-looking
as well.
-Yes, I know.

23:57.240 --> 24:02.000
Anyway, the guy at Aston,
their technical officer,
is called Max "Szwaj".

24:02.040 --> 24:05.000
-What?
-Max "Szwaj".

24:05.040 --> 24:07.280
-"Szwaj"?
-No, "Sz".

24:07.320 --> 24:09.880
-That's what I said "Szwa".
-No, it's "Sz".

24:09.920 --> 24:13.400
-You sound like a broken
dentist drill, "Szwaj".
-You're just being racist.

24:13.440 --> 24:15.200
-I'm not!
-You are, the man's Irish.

24:15.240 --> 24:18.560
-I'm not being racist!
-Just cos you want him
to be called Paddy O'Malley!

24:18.600 --> 24:22.520
I didn't say... You can't
accuse me of being racist
on television!

24:22.560 --> 24:24.840
Anyway, we'll gloss over
your frankly...

24:24.880 --> 24:27.960
-I'm not. That is...
-It's embarrassing.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.640
They've also... He,
I should say, Max "Szwaj",

24:30.680 --> 24:34.520
has also put the Mercedes
engine in the DB11.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.920
And I love that engine,
and I love that car.

24:36.960 --> 24:39.120
That's gonna be
one hell of a combination.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.000
RICHARD: Could be amazing.
How much will it be?

24:41.040 --> 24:44.440
Well, weirdly,
not much less than the V12.

24:44.480 --> 24:48.160
But I think that the V8
will be better cos
the engine will be lighter.

24:48.200 --> 24:51.800
So what you're saying,
in fact,
is smaller is better.

24:51.840 --> 24:53.280
(LAUGHTER)

24:54.840 --> 24:59.160
-No.
-(LAUGHTER)

24:59.200 --> 25:02.960
You know Chinese companies
like to give themselves
Western names, OK?

25:03.000 --> 25:06.960
-I know what you mean.
-Well, there's a Chinese
spare part company.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.960
They do brakes
and what have you,
that's called, erm, this.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.840

25:14.880 --> 25:16.880
Well, well, it's...

25:16.920 --> 25:19.000

-It's memorable, isn't it?

25:19.040 --> 25:21.600
Thing is, though, if you
type that into Google...

25:21.640 --> 25:24.480
-Oh, don't!
-(LAUGHTER)

25:24.520 --> 25:29.360
You've really got some strong
images for 27 pages before
you get to your brake disks.

Sitting there an hour later
with eyes like that.

25:31.960 --> 25:36.960
"Only wanted some brake pads,
and now I've seen things
I can't unsee!"

25:37.000 --> 25:38.880
What were you looking for
when you came across...?

25:38.920 --> 25:40.360

25:40.400 --> 25:41.800
What had you put in?

25:41.840 --> 25:44.600

all 27,000 pages
to get to that one?

25:44.640 --> 25:46.200

week's Conversation Street.

25:51.760 --> 25:55.760
-(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
-That's very kind, thank you.

25:55.800 --> 25:59.800
Thank you, and now it's time
to get back to our film

25:59.840 --> 26:03.800
in which we're proving
that Jaguar's reputation
for unreliability

26:03.840 --> 26:06.160
is completely unfounded.

26:06.200 --> 26:10.840
Yes, we pick up the action
at a hotel where,
because we're driving Jags,

26:10.880 --> 26:15.800
we'd spent the night in rooms
as far away as possible
from the reception desk,

26:15.840 --> 26:21.080
and its pesky
checking-out requirements.

26:21.120 --> 26:25.240
JEREMY: The next morning
we were up way before
the hotel staff,

26:25.280 --> 26:27.240
to get back on the road.

26:35.920 --> 26:38.040
(CLATTERING)

26:43.080 --> 26:45.160
-Morning.
-Morning.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.000
What's with the towels?

26:47.040 --> 26:49.080
Well, they had
this sign that explained

26:49.120 --> 26:51.960
how environmentally damaging
and expensive it is
to wash them,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.120
so I've saved them
the trouble.

26:54.160 --> 26:55.800
-That's good thinking.
-That's kind.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.760
That is.

27:03.680 --> 27:06.400
JEREMY: Because we'd had
such an early start,

27:06.440 --> 27:08.920
we decided after
a little while to pull over

27:08.960 --> 27:13.800
and admire some of the
beautiful rock formations.

27:13.840 --> 27:16.240
-(ENGINE SPUTTERING)
JEREMY: Do you see
the sandstone has been

27:16.280 --> 27:21.760
eroded by time, wind,
and the pressure of
water seeping through it.

27:21.800 --> 27:24.200
(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

27:24.240 --> 27:27.880
It's baffling, isn't it,
how a simple stream

27:27.920 --> 27:33.440
can have carved such
an extraordinary gorge.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.920
I don't think there's any
point continuing to do that.

27:35.960 --> 27:38.920
I think you're going to just
melt the starter motor.

27:38.960 --> 27:42.480
Now, it's a heck of
a battery, though.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.680
JAMES: How have you managed
to break it so quickly?

27:44.720 --> 27:47.400
-Literally we left
the hotel...
-You've had it five minutes!

27:47.440 --> 27:48.640
...40 minutes ago.

27:48.680 --> 27:51.560
It's something I've done.
It's certainly not the car.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.920
-Look at those cross braces.
JEREMY: Mm.

27:53.960 --> 27:56.560
I fitted those as well,
that it didn't have before.

27:59.160 --> 28:01.920
JEREMY: Because the problem
was bound to be minor,

28:01.960 --> 28:04.000
James and I
left Richard to it

28:04.040 --> 28:08.280
and continued onwards
to our next destination.

28:12.960 --> 28:16.120
JEREMY:
This is one hell of a road!

28:16.160 --> 28:21.240
Surface is good.
Scenery is fantastic.
No traffic.

28:21.280 --> 28:26.520
These were ideal conditions
for a Jag like mine.

28:26.560 --> 28:30.320
One of the things
I absolutely love
about the XJR

28:30.360 --> 28:35.800
is the way the faster you go,
the more it starts to
sort of float.

28:35.840 --> 28:39.520
It's like you're sort of
powder skiing.

28:39.560 --> 28:41.840
(IMITATES SKIING SOUNDS)

28:41.880 --> 28:46.960
It actually encourages you
to go faster because
you're so relaxed.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.680
This, let's not forget,
is a 155-mile-an-hour
machine.

28:52.720 --> 28:55.840
Nought to 60,
five-and-a-half seconds.

28:55.880 --> 28:59.000
It's quick,
even by today's standards.

29:02.280 --> 29:07.080
Right, problem is fuel pump
not working, that's because
there's no power to it.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.040
But the really clever thing
about a Jaguar

29:09.080 --> 29:11.720
is you get lots of
spare stuff you can use

29:11.760 --> 29:14.320
when a problem arises,
should it,
which is very unlikely.

29:14.360 --> 29:17.880
In this instance,
I disconnected this which
powers the electric aerial.

29:17.920 --> 29:20.800
That has got power.
Obviously I can do without
the electric aerial.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.400
I didn't want to
use it anyway.

29:22.440 --> 29:26.640
Hook this up to the
fuel pump, job done,
we're away.

29:26.680 --> 29:30.120
JEREMY: Sure enough,
he was soon back
on the move...

29:32.840 --> 29:35.120
I love this thing.
It's a beautiful little car.

Yes, Constable, however,

Very good, yes.

It never fails in America.

I also told the officer I was
travelling with Mrs May,

30:30.240 --> 30:31.680
the British Prime Minister.

30:33.480 --> 30:35.880

James and I had arrived
at the location for our
next challenge...

31:28.640 --> 31:30.400
...a runway.

31:30.440 --> 31:33.000
And once our colleague
had arrived,

31:33.040 --> 31:36.720
I explained what
Mr Wilman had planned.

31:36.760 --> 31:40.960
We'll go from here,
one at a time, 0-100,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.080
and then back to 0 again.

31:43.120 --> 31:46.960
You've got to stop before
the end of the runway,
and really do have to stop,

31:47.000 --> 31:52.400
because this airport has a...
a slightly unusual feature.

31:52.440 --> 31:55.760
Perched on the summit
of a rocky mountain,

31:55.800 --> 32:01.080
Telluride is the highest

And at the end of the runway,
there is...

If anything, the engine seems
to have become even smoother,

36:39.720 --> 36:43.760
almost as if it's gained
50% more cylinders.

36:43.800 --> 36:47.720
But that's the thing
about Jags,
they just get better.

36:49.840 --> 36:53.040
JEREMY: With all three cars
still running well,

36:53.080 --> 36:58.040
we headed off to face
our final and toughest
challenge...

36:58.080 --> 37:01.160
...in the ski resort
of Telluride.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.680
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

37:07.720 --> 37:09.800
-They applauded your death.
-They did.

37:09.840 --> 37:12.160
-They applauded your death.
-Thank you very much!

37:12.200 --> 37:16.040
I have to say though, James,
it really was extraordinary

37:16.080 --> 37:20.080
that you went down
that 1,000-foot fall,
not a scratch.

37:20.120 --> 37:22.120
Completely unharmed.

37:22.160 --> 37:25.160
It's weird that Jag
don't make more of that
in their commercials.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.760
Anyway,
we'll pick that up later on.

37:26.800 --> 37:30.200
Now though, it's time for
Celebrity Face Off.

37:39.320 --> 37:41.080
(APPLAUSE)

37:41.120 --> 37:46.280
Yeah, and today we are asking
another important question,
and it's this.

37:46.320 --> 37:51.880
Who is the world's
fastest actor, whose
middle name is George?

37:51.920 --> 37:55.960
Surprisingly hard to find
contenders for this one,
but we've managed it.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.840
So please welcome Luke Evans
and Kiefer Sutherland!

37:59.880 --> 38:02.560
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

38:04.320 --> 38:06.880
Jack Bauer! How are you?

38:06.920 --> 38:10.200
You. How are you?
Have a seat.

38:10.240 --> 38:12.200
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

38:12.240 --> 38:16.560
No messing about this week!
We are not messing about.

38:16.600 --> 38:19.640
(APPLAUSE CONTINUES)

38:19.680 --> 38:22.600
Can I just explain
before we start? Yes.

38:22.640 --> 38:26.000
-You get a Canadian flag
because you're Canadian?
-Yeah.

38:26.040 --> 38:28.360
-But if you win
it'll become British.
-It'll become British.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.800
-Because you were born...
-I was born in London.

38:30.840 --> 38:33.360
-Born in London, so do you
have a British passport?
-I do.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.480
-And you're a Canadian
citizen?
-Yes.

38:35.520 --> 38:37.600
-But you live in America?
-Yes.

38:37.640 --> 38:40.040
-(LAUGHTER)
-I am a well-travelled man!

38:40.080 --> 38:42.640
Yeah. You travel
the colonies. Erm...

38:42.680 --> 38:44.280
(LAUGHTER)

38:46.080 --> 38:49.440
-You're Welsh
whatever happens.
-Good.

38:49.480 --> 38:51.520
Now, this business
of middle names...

38:51.560 --> 38:53.640
-You've just got the one
middle name?
-Yes.

38:53.680 --> 38:55.520
-Which is George?
-George, yes.

38:55.560 --> 38:57.440
-You...
-I've got the five.

38:57.480 --> 38:59.080
-(LAUGHTER)
-Which are...

38:59.120 --> 39:02.600
Kiefer William Frederick
Dempsey George
Rufus Sutherland.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.280
-Ah, wow!
-(CROWD MURMURS)

39:05.320 --> 39:07.880
-So, your dad--
-My father owed
a lot of people money!

39:07.920 --> 39:09.640
(LAUGHTER)

39:09.680 --> 39:14.400
I think he would just say,
"I can't pay you, but I'll
name my son after you."

39:14.440 --> 39:15.640
(LAUGHTER)

39:15.680 --> 39:17.280
Now we'll get onto you,
Luke, if we may.

39:17.320 --> 39:20.240
Obviously, your new
blockbuster is
Beauty And The Beast.

39:20.280 --> 39:23.760
But you're best known,
certainly among this
audience, I should imagine-

39:23.800 --> 39:26.280
-I've a feeling I know
which one it is.
-Fast and Furious.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.280
-Yeah.
-Fast and Furious 6.

39:28.320 --> 39:31.720
-Yeah.
-(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)

39:31.760 --> 39:37.440
Now, what fascinates me
about this Fast and Furious
business is somehow

39:37.480 --> 39:42.280
you make a living from
driving around, smashing up
very expensive cars.

39:42.320 --> 39:44.280
I mean, how is that
even possible?

39:44.320 --> 39:46.520
-(LAUGHTER)
-You tell me.

39:46.560 --> 39:48.440
-(LAUGHTER)
-Touché.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.680
-It must be a riot.
-It is a riot, yeah.

39:50.720 --> 39:54.040
Especially when they... they
make them from scratch,

39:54.080 --> 39:56.360
like the flip car
that I drove in Fast 6.

39:56.400 --> 39:59.440
That was hand-made by
this genius in Los Angeles

39:59.480 --> 40:01.960
who makes all
the cars in the films.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.520
-And the flip car was--
-It's got a tongue on it...

40:04.560 --> 40:07.080
It's basically like
a door wedge, basically,

40:07.120 --> 40:09.320
which had, I think it was
a Formula One engine.

40:09.360 --> 40:12.200
But it was just the shell,
so the sound was deafening.

40:12.240 --> 40:15.640
We all had to have ear plugs
and stuff and...
But it was great.

40:15.680 --> 40:18.720
All the wheels could crab,
so they all could turn
at the same time,

40:18.760 --> 40:22.000
so you go could
go underneath lorries,
trailer lorries.

40:22.040 --> 40:24.240
-They're tricky to drive,
I presume.
-Very tricky.

40:24.280 --> 40:28.680
It was, erm...it wasn't
a normal sort of gear shift.
It was a ratchet.

40:28.720 --> 40:33.960
So you'd have to press
a button and then you had
to pump the clutch

40:34.000 --> 40:38.080
then you had to
ratchet it up to first,
and it was so complicated.

40:38.120 --> 40:40.520
-While doing acting?
-While doing acting, yeah.

40:40.560 --> 40:41.760
(LAUGHTER)

40:41.800 --> 40:45.720
See, he's so cool, why would
you have me on the show?

40:45.760 --> 40:49.600
No, I mean, you do crash even
more cars than Hammond does.

40:49.640 --> 40:52.000
-(LAUGHTER)
-I've got the figures here.

40:52.040 --> 40:54.960
You've destroyed, or the
Fast And Furious people,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.960
-1,478 cars...
-Wow!

40:58.000 --> 41:01.120
...in the franchise,
which is quite a lot.
Someone worked out the cost.

41:01.160 --> 41:04.760
-You've only done £3.7
million worth of damage.
-That's not bad.

41:04.800 --> 41:08.280
Jason Statham's got through
148 million quid's worth
of cars.

41:08.320 --> 41:10.040
(LAUGHTER)

41:10.080 --> 41:12.480
Actually, Richard Hammond
has provided me with
a question here.

41:12.520 --> 41:14.920
He said, "Is it because
he can't drive very well?"

41:14.960 --> 41:18.400
I did not say that! I didn't!
Why would I fall out with
Jason Statham?

41:18.440 --> 41:20.080
-I didn't say that!
-You thought it.

41:20.120 --> 41:22.080
Can he drive? I've always
wanted to get Jason...

41:22.120 --> 41:24.880
I have no idea!
Yes, I'm sure, yeah. I...

41:24.920 --> 41:27.880
-Are you sure he can't drive?
There you go, Hammond.
-I didn't ask that!

41:27.920 --> 41:29.360
I'm sure he can.

41:29.400 --> 41:32.160
Did you crash any cars?
Not to the extent they do,
but did you?

41:32.200 --> 41:34.840
No, actually,
I was thinking how cool
all your stories were.

41:34.880 --> 41:36.200
Mine was so embarrassing.

41:36.240 --> 41:38.920
Er...I had a scene,
all I had to do,

41:38.960 --> 41:41.840
and a very normal car,
the wheels didn't crab,

41:41.880 --> 41:45.800
I just had to drive it to the
mark, get out, draw my weapon
and say something.

41:45.840 --> 41:49.680
And that day they had
a really wonderful actress.

41:49.720 --> 41:53.320
I had a bit of a crush
on her, and I was really
trying to show off.

41:53.360 --> 41:57.960
And I spun the car a bit,
threw it into a stop,
threw open the door,

41:58.000 --> 42:01.840
pulled out my weapon,
said my line and slowly
the car passed me.

42:01.880 --> 42:03.640
(LAUGHTER)

42:03.680 --> 42:06.560
I had forgot...
I had forgot to
put it in park.

42:06.600 --> 42:11.080
And er...and it hit the fence
that the camera operator was
sitting on and he fell off.

42:11.120 --> 42:12.120
(LAUGHTER)

42:12.160 --> 42:16.120
The girl never talked to me
again and that was
the end of my day.

42:16.160 --> 42:20.080
We'll get onto cars cos you
both started with Mustangs,
I think I'm right in saying.

42:20.120 --> 42:22.560
-Yeah.
-Well, sort of yeah.

42:22.600 --> 42:25.960
-You were very late to...
-Yeah, I was 30 when
I passed my driving test.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.160
I'd never been to LA,
and I had to go there
for a screen test,

42:29.200 --> 42:34.600
and the first time I got in a
car on my own was a hire car
from LAX Airport,

42:34.640 --> 42:38.080
which was a Mustang,
and then I went on the 405
to West Hollywood.

42:38.120 --> 42:40.400
-Shat myself.
-That'll teach you
how to drive!

42:40.440 --> 42:41.760
(LAUGHTER)

42:41.800 --> 42:45.880
My hands were so wet
that they were sliding off
the steering wheel.

42:45.920 --> 42:50.360
-And the steering wheel's on
the wrong side of the road.
-I mean, five lanes!

42:50.400 --> 42:54.320
I do love saying wrong
side of the road in front of
people who aren't... (LAUGHS)

42:54.360 --> 42:56.320
It's the right side
of the road.
We're the idiots.

42:56.360 --> 42:58.320
No, we're not.
No, we're not!

42:58.360 --> 43:01.120
Steering wheel's on
the wrong side, on
the wrong side of the road.

43:01.160 --> 43:04.320
-The 405 is a nightmare.
-It's hell.

43:04.360 --> 43:06.960
-I'd not want to do
my first solo drive.
-Yeah.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.640
-Now your first car was a--
-My first car was
a 1967 Mustang.

43:10.680 --> 43:14.480
And er...I had a couple of
jobs in New York,

43:14.520 --> 43:16.800
that allowed me
to buy the car.

43:16.840 --> 43:19.560
Then I was gonna drive it
from New York to Los Angeles,

43:19.600 --> 43:22.160
where I had another job
waiting for me.

43:22.200 --> 43:24.560
And I was driving
across Texas,

43:24.600 --> 43:28.720
and this was the cheaper
model of the 1967 Mustang.

43:28.760 --> 43:30.800
It was a straight-six,
not a lot of power.

43:30.840 --> 43:34.920
And I guess there was
an 80-mile-an-hour wind
coming east.

43:34.960 --> 43:36.560
(LAUGHTER)

43:36.600 --> 43:40.560
I was trying to go west,
and the wind was more
powerful than my car

43:40.600 --> 43:43.080
so in the middle of the
highway it just stopped.

43:43.120 --> 43:44.280
(LAUGHTER)

43:44.320 --> 43:46.720
And, I'm not
a mechanically-inclined guy

43:46.760 --> 43:49.840
so I got rid of the Mustang
as quickly as I could.

43:49.880 --> 43:52.480
You, on the other hand,
are mechanically-minded,
aren't you?

43:52.520 --> 43:57.880
Yeah, well, my best mate
as I grew up was
a farmer's boy

43:57.920 --> 44:00.960
and so I was always
on the farms with him.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.560
And there was, like, tractors
and quads and motorbikes.

44:04.600 --> 44:08.320
-Are you a bike enthusiast?
-My dad is a big biker.
Like, big, big biker.

44:08.360 --> 44:11.120
So I was always on
the back of his bike.

44:11.160 --> 44:13.280
Pillion passengers through
the Brecon Beacons, you know?

44:13.320 --> 44:15.120
Did your dad have a 1600E?

44:15.160 --> 44:17.440
That was...
Yeah, when I was born,

44:17.480 --> 44:21.240
he had a 1600E Cortina
in azure blue,

44:21.280 --> 44:24.240
and when I was born,
he put my name on
his number plate.

44:24.280 --> 44:26.160
I grew up with this
very special car.

44:26.200 --> 44:28.360
Well, now you're into
my specialist subject here.

44:28.400 --> 44:32.120
You may have to tune out for
a moment here, because to...

44:32.160 --> 44:34.280
I don't think it was
available in blue,
the 1600E.

44:34.320 --> 44:38.680
No. It wasn't.
But you'll need to ask him
the answer to that.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.440
-Why, is he here?
-He's there.

44:40.480 --> 44:44.000
-Was it, how did you get...?
He's brought his dad?
-Brought my dad, yeah.

44:44.040 --> 44:46.640
-Have you brought your dad?
-No.
-That'd be hilarious.

44:46.680 --> 44:48.160
(LAUGHTER)

44:48.200 --> 44:51.120
How did you have
a blue Cortina 1600E?

44:51.160 --> 44:53.520
Well, the Mark IIs
came out in the silver fox,

44:53.560 --> 44:55.960
but after a few years
they started to fade.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.280
-So I bought one and
I had it re-sprayed.
-You painted it?

44:59.320 --> 45:01.480
-I thought, I sort of...
-Stylish for a Valley boy!

45:01.520 --> 45:04.680
-(LAUGHTER)
-Azure blue, I mean, come on!

45:04.720 --> 45:07.880
I had a 1600E.
It was amber gold.
They were the coolest cars.

45:07.920 --> 45:10.280
-Do you remember it?
-Yeah, I do remember it.
It was beautiful.

45:10.320 --> 45:14.120
I mean, I remember that
I chipped the...
the walnut, er, dashboard,

45:14.160 --> 45:18.840
cos I was in the car
like this with my teeth,
and he'd braked and I split.

45:18.880 --> 45:22.120
I literally have guilt
even now and I was
only five at the time.

45:22.160 --> 45:26.360
Your dad was cross with you
for smashing your teeth out
cos he braked too hard?

45:26.400 --> 45:28.960
Oh, yeah, the car was
everything, like yeah.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.800
You smashed your
face in on the dashboard?

45:30.840 --> 45:33.960
Yeah, I lost my front teeth,
but it was the walnut veneer
that was the...

45:34.000 --> 45:38.280
-This is the Poor Parenting
Award here, this is.
-(LAUGHTER)

45:38.320 --> 45:39.920
Now we've got to find out,

45:39.960 --> 45:42.200
well, basically whether
we're gonna call you
Canadian or British.

45:42.240 --> 45:45.120
-Who wants to see their laps?
-(CHEERING)

45:45.160 --> 45:48.160
-So, Kiefer, we're gonna
have a look at yours first.
-OK.

45:48.200 --> 45:49.440
So, here we go.

45:49.480 --> 45:53.640
JEREMY: It's a beautiful day
once again
in the heartland of England.

45:53.680 --> 45:56.640
Accelerate.
Accelerate, brake.

45:56.680 --> 46:00.600
That's the right way
to do it. Oh, cutting
that corner nicely.

46:00.640 --> 46:04.200
It's tricky here cos you've
got to slow down then
get on the power,

46:04.240 --> 46:06.320
which you've done very well
as you go left

46:06.360 --> 46:09.800
and into what we're calling
The Difficult Bit.

46:09.840 --> 46:11.960
And there we go.

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
Oh, that's tidy.
That is tidy. Not exuberant.

46:16.040 --> 46:17.640
(CHUCKLES)

46:17.680 --> 46:19.880
(AUDIENCE LAUGHTER)

46:19.920 --> 46:25.720
Through the banked turned,
the Gravelsel, and back down
toward the Difficult Bit Two.

46:25.760 --> 46:28.280
I must say you are
holding that very nicely
through there.

46:28.320 --> 46:32.920
We had the traction control
wound back so you've got
a loose rear end.

46:32.960 --> 46:37.240
Now it goes very slippery.
Oh, nicely held there.

46:37.280 --> 46:40.640
On the power ready to go down
the straight bit that isn't
really very straight,

46:40.680 --> 46:42.920
like our other track.

46:42.960 --> 46:45.720
Hell, let's see if
you've got any bottle.

46:45.760 --> 46:50.120
Supposed to be flat through.
Oh...that is actually
very quick through there!

46:50.160 --> 46:51.680
That is very nicely
done indeed.

46:51.720 --> 46:55.440
Hard on the brakes and
through the last corner

46:55.480 --> 46:57.600
also very nicely
and across the line.

46:57.640 --> 47:01.160
-That is tidy!
-(APPLAUSE)

47:01.200 --> 47:05.800
Tidy lap. It was quite good.

47:05.840 --> 47:09.240
-You've got people that are
very helpful out there.
-Yeah. Well, they do.

47:09.280 --> 47:12.400
They teach you how, but then
you've got to go solo.
You have to do it.

47:12.440 --> 47:15.240
-So how was yours, good fun?
-I loved it.

47:15.280 --> 47:18.240
I didn't want to get out.
They had to peel me
out of the car!

47:18.280 --> 47:19.880
-Who'd like to see the lap?
-(CHEERING)

47:19.920 --> 47:21.760
Come on.
Let's have a look at Luke's.

47:21.800 --> 47:23.880
(ENGINE REVS)

47:26.120 --> 47:28.720
-(YELLS) Come on!
-(LAUGHTER)

47:28.760 --> 47:32.720
OK, right. Also cutting
the corner, taking it...

47:32.760 --> 47:36.920
I think it's a good idea
to go sl... Oh, ha-ha.

47:36.960 --> 47:42.240
Just about hold it together
and onto the gravel.

47:42.280 --> 47:45.480
Listen to that exhaust
popping away, that's good
for a two-litre engine, that.

47:45.520 --> 47:49.200
Oh, exuberant!
Coming wide through there,
that looks good.

47:49.240 --> 47:52.400
This gravel is crazy!

47:52.440 --> 47:57.440
It's not necessarily the
fastest way to have the arse
of it hanging out like that,

47:57.480 --> 47:59.120
but it does look good.

47:59.160 --> 48:02.480
Right, yeah, looking good
through there as well.

48:02.520 --> 48:05.360
This is keeping it tidier,
this is better.

48:05.400 --> 48:09.120
It can get a bit fish-taily
down here if you're not
careful, but it's all right.

48:09.160 --> 48:12.800
And onto the slippery,
dusty bit.

48:12.840 --> 48:15.440
Keeping it wide.

48:15.480 --> 48:18.680
Now, flat-out.
Do you keep it flat through
the last corner?

48:18.720 --> 48:20.800
Now I should brake,
but I'm not gonna.

48:22.880 --> 48:25.640
Are you not gonna brake?
No, you are not!

48:25.680 --> 48:28.080
Oh, though, that is fast,
nearly losing it,

48:28.120 --> 48:31.200
but just got it together
in time to brake
for the last corner.

48:31.240 --> 48:33.760
Nicely held through there
and across the line!

48:33.800 --> 48:36.120
-(APPLAUSE)
-Well done.

48:37.680 --> 48:39.760
Well done.

48:39.800 --> 48:43.560
Right. I have got
your times here.

48:43.600 --> 48:45.800
(CLEARS THROAT)

48:45.840 --> 48:48.040
So, Kiefer Sutherland,

48:48.080 --> 48:53.680
you did it in
one minute...17.8.

48:53.720 --> 48:56.720
-OK.
-I'll pop that up there, now.

48:56.760 --> 48:59.120
(APPLAUSE)

49:02.840 --> 49:05.720
Luke Evans. One minute...

49:06.920 --> 49:09.440
...21.3.

49:09.480 --> 49:12.120
(CROWD GROANS, APPLAUSE)

49:12.160 --> 49:15.000
So, there's nothing
we can do about that.

49:15.040 --> 49:16.760
LUKE: I loved it.

49:16.800 --> 49:20.000
-Now you're British!
-Oh, great!

49:20.040 --> 49:23.720
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)

49:24.880 --> 49:26.640
Can't resist it.

49:27.760 --> 49:29.840
So there we are.

49:29.880 --> 49:33.480
Just in case you're thinking,
"Oh, no, I'm gonna have to
hang myself..."

49:33.520 --> 49:37.960
-(LAUGHS)
-We've had a 1:24.4.
1:24.1. 1:23.6. 1:23.

49:38.000 --> 49:41.080
You're actually there
the fifth fastest.

49:41.120 --> 49:42.720
So that's really
not a bad time.

49:42.760 --> 49:45.760
It's just his was stellar,
absolutely stellar.

49:45.800 --> 49:47.640
There we are,
ladies and gentlemen,

49:47.680 --> 49:50.720
Luke Evans and the
fastest actor in the world

49:50.760 --> 49:53.960
whose middle name is George,
Kiefer Sutherland!

49:54.000 --> 49:55.440
-(CHEERING)
-Thank you very much.

49:55.480 --> 49:58.840
-(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
LUKE: Brilliant!

50:01.640 --> 50:03.560
Now, thank you.

50:03.600 --> 50:06.080
Now, tonight we are proving

50:06.120 --> 50:09.560
that old Jaguars are
reliable and brilliant.

50:09.600 --> 50:13.320
Yep, and we rejoin the action
just as we are about to embark

50:13.360 --> 50:17.000
on one of the biggest
challenges us three
have ever faced,

50:17.040 --> 50:21.040
avoiding the expense
of ski passes and
hiring all the kit,

50:21.080 --> 50:24.240
by going skiing in our cars.

50:34.640 --> 50:37.920
JEREMY:
Easter Sunday, Telluride.

50:37.960 --> 50:41.560
Rich pickings for a man
with a Jag.

50:43.440 --> 50:45.400
Hello, my dear.

50:46.960 --> 50:49.760
JEREMY: Having found
somewhere to park,

50:49.800 --> 50:52.200
Hammond checked
into the hotel.

50:52.240 --> 50:55.560
Check-in please. Thank you.
Can I borrow your pen?
Thank you.

50:55.600 --> 50:59.760
WOMAN: You can fill that out.
And right here is your key.

50:59.800 --> 51:02.200
-Room number, Wi-Fi.
-Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.

51:09.840 --> 51:12.400
I, meanwhile,
headed for the restaurant.

51:15.280 --> 51:17.200

51:22.040 --> 51:23.440
(EXHALES)

51:38.280 --> 51:40.520
(GULPS)

51:52.440 --> 51:54.400
It's definitely corked.

51:54.440 --> 51:56.600
(SIGHS) Sorry.

52:01.440 --> 52:04.240
The next morning,
it was cold outside.

52:04.280 --> 52:08.000
So, we needed warm clothes
for our trip
up the mountains.

52:08.040 --> 52:12.560
James therefore
went shopping, Jag-style.

52:15.280 --> 52:17.320
And I didn't.

52:20.920 --> 52:25.160
Welcome to the hotel, sir. I
could take your... your coat.

52:25.200 --> 52:27.440
Thank you very much.

52:27.480 --> 52:30.280
-Had a pleasant trip?
-Yes. Yes, thank you.

52:30.320 --> 52:32.360
-Your hat?
-Oh, well, thank you.

52:32.400 --> 52:34.560
Perhaps your bag as well,
sir. Thank you very much.

52:34.600 --> 52:37.320
If you'd like to see my
colleague on reception
that would be marvellous.

52:37.360 --> 52:39.720
-Excellent.
-Thank you very much.
Thank you.

52:43.000 --> 52:46.600
Right, that's my warm weather
gear sorted out.

52:46.640 --> 52:49.440
I actually nicked that idea
from Peter Sellers.

52:49.480 --> 52:54.200
Don't think he'll mind
because of course,
he had a Jag.

52:54.240 --> 52:57.960
Once we were fully equipped
with suitable clothing,

52:58.000 --> 53:00.840
we drove straight
past the lifts,

53:00.880 --> 53:03.320
and hit the gradients.

53:03.360 --> 53:04.920
Ha-ha, slopes.

53:04.960 --> 53:09.840
Here we go. Speed and power.

53:09.880 --> 53:15.120
Unfortunately, for once,
speed and power
didn't seem to do the trick.

53:15.160 --> 53:19.520
Oh... Ski, damn you!
Come on ski, Jag!

53:19.560 --> 53:24.320
We're going to have to admit
this isn't working.

53:24.360 --> 53:26.920
Luckily, James then
had a brainwave.

53:28.080 --> 53:29.440
(TOOLS CLATTERING)

53:29.480 --> 53:33.360
And down at the resort's
workshop, he borrowed
some metal poles,

53:33.400 --> 53:37.400
which he used to
shackle our cars together.

53:41.760 --> 53:44.840
If this works,
I'll eat my own head.

53:44.880 --> 53:47.560
Six-wheel drive,
all at the same time.

53:47.600 --> 53:53.520

53:57.520 --> 54:01.280

(ENGINE REVVING)

54:21.400 --> 54:23.560

you're jack-knifing me
towards the edge.

54:23.600 --> 54:25.600
Or Clarkson,
one of you, somebody.

54:25.640 --> 54:27.800
I'm not doing anything!
You're steering.

54:27.840 --> 54:30.000
You're at the front.
You're the head
of this caterpillar!

54:30.040 --> 54:32.800
JAMES: I'm not steering!
You are. It's jack-knife...

54:32.840 --> 54:36.480
No, it's the edge!
Stop, stop!

Right, everybody in reverse.

54:45.960 --> 54:50.520
-Jeremy, where are you going?
-You're the one that
steers us going backwards.

54:50.560 --> 54:53.160
I wasn't steering you
that way, why are you there?

54:53.200 --> 54:57.280
-You've jack-knifed us
Hammond, you stupid idiot!
-I'm not doing that!

54:57.320 --> 55:00.200
I'm not!

55:00.240 --> 55:02.520
Eventually,
after much bickering...

55:02.560 --> 55:04.640
JEREMY: You're pushing me
over the edge,
you blithering...

55:04.680 --> 55:07.200
JAMES: When you're
going backwards,
you're steering you.

55:07.240 --> 55:09.680
-Whose idea was this?
-Hammond,
you're doing it again.

55:09.720 --> 55:12.040
...we started to
get the hang of it.

55:16.480 --> 55:22.040
I knew this would work.
All you got to do is
co-ordinate the brains.

55:22.080 --> 55:25.440
This is what comes from
many, many years of
working together,

55:25.480 --> 55:28.560
that intuitive bond
that links us.

55:28.600 --> 55:30.600
Bond of hatred.

And there we are, the summit.

Good. Right, let's unhitch.

56:07.280 --> 56:13.400
JEREMY: Having bypassed
the lifts and cable cars, it
was time to start skiing.

56:13.440 --> 56:15.440
Which was a bit of a worry.

56:15.480 --> 56:17.200
Don't look over that edge.

56:17.240 --> 56:20.680
But there's a bit of...
It gets really steep.

56:20.720 --> 56:23.560

People do this for fun, yeah?

56:23.600 --> 56:26.000
JAMES: Not in old Jags.
-Oh, yeah, you're right.

56:26.040 --> 56:31.560
If you went wrong here, look.
You'd have time to phone
your insurance company.

I can see Heathrow from here.

way down was down,
we set off.

I need to bail out.

working a bit... Ah!

57:17.960 --> 57:21.280
Ooh!

Oh, gawd. What you've got
to be wary of is losing
the back of the car.

(YELLS) Ah...it won't stop!

57:49.720 --> 57:52.880

There's nothing... No.

57:52.920 --> 57:55.240
Jesus Christ!

57:55.280 --> 57:58.840
Mercifully, the gradient
eventually levelled out,

57:58.880 --> 58:03.520
but then it became
very narrow.

58:03.560 --> 58:05.760
Oh, my God!
Look at the drop on our left.

58:07.920 --> 58:09.440

58:12.600 --> 58:14.720
It's... Oh, God.

58:16.120 --> 58:19.240
(GASPS) Oh!
That's genuinely alarming!

58:20.440 --> 58:22.280

58:26.040 --> 58:28.160
Bloody hell.

58:28.200 --> 58:30.880
Just, why don't you just go
in a straight line?

58:30.920 --> 58:34.240
Just please,
just briefly... (GASPS)

58:34.280 --> 58:38.600
JEREMY: James, is your car
crabbing as well for
absolutely no reason?

58:38.640 --> 58:41.680
JAMES: Yeah,
it's absolutely terrifying.

58:41.720 --> 58:44.800
RICHARD: Oh. Oh.

58:44.840 --> 58:47.040
Don't look at the view.
Don't look at the drop.

58:49.760 --> 58:53.440
JEREMY: (BEEP) ing hell,
this is scary.

58:53.480 --> 58:56.320
Ah...oh.

58:56.360 --> 59:00.000
(GASPS) Oh, shit. Shit, shit!

59:00.040 --> 59:02.960
Having not fallen over
the terrifying drop,

59:03.000 --> 59:05.360
we then had to
drive down one.

59:05.400 --> 59:08.040
Holy mother of God!

59:10.360 --> 59:12.320
Oh, my God!

59:15.960 --> 59:17.480
Oh, my giddy aunt.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.960
This is quick now.

59:22.160 --> 59:24.520
Oh-ho-ho!

59:24.560 --> 59:29.560
I'm gonna change up a gear.
That was a mistake.
That was a massive mistake.

59:32.840 --> 59:35.640
Just go in a straight line,
you bastard.

59:39.320 --> 59:41.480
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.

59:42.720 --> 59:44.560
(YELLS) Oh!

59:44.600 --> 59:50.040
But none of us died,
and then Jag-skiing
started to come together.

59:59.800 --> 1:00:04.480
Oh, yes, I'm slalom skiing
now is what I'm doing,
and I'm doing it well!

1:00:08.600 --> 1:00:10.360
Ya-ha-ha!

1:00:12.160 --> 1:00:13.840
JAMES: Ho-ho!

1:00:13.880 --> 1:00:18.320
And let's be honest,
after one day on normal skis,

1:00:18.360 --> 1:00:20.400
you'd still be
pretty rubbish.

1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:25.760
Whereas here,
we are absolutely brilliant.

1:00:25.800 --> 1:00:29.240
Love to do this with
other people on the slopes
at the same time.

1:00:29.280 --> 1:00:32.000
Could actually
run into a snowboarder.

1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:34.360
"Oh, I'm sorry,
was that annoying?

1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:36.240
Now you know
what it feels like."

1:00:36.280 --> 1:00:41.040
Eventually, we started on the
final leg down into the town,

1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:44.480
and Richard and I
got into a bit of a race.

1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:47.480
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:49.960
Give me a little bit more go.

1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:53.600
Oh, bumpy, oh, very bumpy.
Very bumpy.

1:00:53.640 --> 1:00:56.480
-Oh, yes.
-Oh, no!

1:00:59.080 --> 1:01:01.160
Whoa, that was a biggy!

1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:04.080
Meanwhile,
a little further back...

1:01:05.640 --> 1:01:09.240
Oh, gawd! I've got
a brake warning light on.

1:01:09.280 --> 1:01:13.560
I don't know what that means.
Pad wear? System failure?
God knows.

1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:18.000
JEREMY: There's the town.

1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:21.920
We're coming in
hot and stylishly.

1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:26.080
And we wouldn't have to walk
to the hotel in silly boots.

1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:28.760
We'd simply drive there.

1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:30.600
Oh, hello.

1:01:30.640 --> 1:01:32.720
Whoa!

1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:35.800
(YELLS) Whaagh!

1:01:36.880 --> 1:01:39.280
RICHARD: Oh-ho-ho-no!

1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:43.200
JEREMY: Oh ho-ho-ho!
Oh, there's been an accident.

1:01:43.240 --> 1:01:45.800
(ENGINE REVS)

1:01:45.840 --> 1:01:47.840
RICHARD: Ah.
JEREMY: Damn.

1:01:47.880 --> 1:01:50.200
RICHARD: Right.

1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:52.920
Only we...

1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:57.200
No, look, we meant to park
them there, they look good.

1:01:57.240 --> 1:01:58.920
JAMES: Oh, no!

1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:03.800
Just keep working, brakes,
for another ten seconds
or so.

1:02:03.840 --> 1:02:06.160
Exactly where we
wanted them to be,

1:02:06.200 --> 1:02:08.400
and that's where they are,
and that's good.

1:02:08.440 --> 1:02:13.160
Er...anyway, the thing is
that we got here...
well, there,

1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:17.920
without a single problem,
and with a very
definite conclusion.

1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:20.640
-Buy an XJR.
-Whoa, no, hang on!

1:02:20.680 --> 1:02:25.200
The point of this exercise
was to demonstrate Jaguar's
reliability as a make.

1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:27.360
Yes, but we have,
and we've also...

1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:29.440
What? Oh.

1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:34.360
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:37.200
Oh, er...

1:02:37.240 --> 1:02:39.120
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1:02:39.160 --> 1:02:44.960
Brilliant, so we get
all the way to the very end,

1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.360
and then you ruin it.

1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:49.880
It was hardly my fault,
was it? The brakes failed!

1:02:49.920 --> 1:02:52.040
-(LAUGHTER)
-But now you've just
told everybody!

1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:55.440
And now they all think that
Jaguars have faults,
and they won't buy one.

1:02:55.480 --> 1:03:00.080
Which means this entire
programme has been
a complete waste of time.

1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:02.520
And on that terrible
disappointment,
it's time to end.

1:03:02.560 --> 1:03:05.360
Thank you so much for
watching, see you next time.
Goodbye.

1:03:05.400 --> 1:03:08.320
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
