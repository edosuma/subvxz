Hey, if I knew I was
gonna get a present,

02:31.985 --> 02:36.406
{\an1}I would've tried out
for a play a long time ago.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.783
{\an1}<i>The Method,</i> by
Lee Strasberg?!

02:38.867 --> 02:40.910
{\an3}I know it sounds like some
kind of birth control,

02:40.994 --> 02:41.911
{\an3}but it's an
acting technique.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.079
Marilyn Monroe used it.

02:43.162 --> 02:44.914
{\an1}And now that you're
the next big thing...

02:44.998 --> 02:47.083
Guys, I just got a callback,

02:47.167 --> 02:48.543
and I think it was
beginner's luck.

02:48.626 --> 02:49.919
Look, don't fight it.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.212
You've got the gift.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.130
There's no law that says

02:52.213 --> 02:54.090
{\an3}you have to be a theater
major like Brenda.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.633
(knocking on door)

02:55.717 --> 02:57.427
I'll get it. Thanks.

03:01.389 --> 03:02.307
Hi. Come on in.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.267
{\an3}We were just
talking about you.

03:06.644 --> 03:07.562
Congratulations.

03:07.645 --> 03:08.438
You got a callback.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.106
Yeah, I saw your name
up there, too.

03:10.189 --> 03:11.232
What a surprise.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.442
Hi, Bren.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.068
Hi.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.404
I mean, all last week,
when I was helping you

03:16.487 --> 03:17.447
{\an3}find the nerve to
audition-- remember?

03:17.530 --> 03:20.575
{\an3}You told me you were going
out for the part of Mae.

03:20.658 --> 03:23.912
I was, but then Roy Randolph
asked me to read for Maggie.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.455
And I suppose he asked you out

03:25.538 --> 03:27.081
{\an3}for coffee after
the audition, too?

03:27.165 --> 03:27.999
Yeah, he did...

03:28.082 --> 03:29.959
and everybody else who
was still stuck there.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.336
Well, if Roy Randolph

03:31.419 --> 03:33.463
{\an3}forced you into it,
why didn't you tell me?

03:33.546 --> 03:35.423
Honestly, I was afraid
of how you would react.

03:35.506 --> 03:37.133
Stab me in the back, I bleed.

03:37.216 --> 03:38.635
Um, you guys, could
you keep it down?

03:38.718 --> 03:39.844
You're scaring the puppy.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.430
{\an1}What do you expect me
to do, Brenda, drop out?

03:42.513 --> 03:43.723
Make more room for you?

03:43.806 --> 03:47.143
{\an5}Kelly, it's not your part.
What makes you
think you own it?

03:47.226 --> 03:48.937
Why don't you get
a life of your own

03:49.020 --> 03:50.188
and stop trying
to steal mine?

03:50.271 --> 03:52.023
I've got a life of my own.

03:52.106 --> 03:53.483
Yeah, I know all about it.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.406
I cannot believe this.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.827
Spirited performances.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.080
I give 'em two thumbs up.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.498
David, this isn't funny.

04:13.461 --> 04:15.171
{\an3}Hey, puppy.
(dog barks)

04:19.509 --> 04:20.218
{\an1}Whoops!

04:20.301 --> 04:23.221
{\an3}Sorry.
No, uh, Bran...

04:23.304 --> 04:24.639
you know
Laura Kingman.

04:24.722 --> 04:25.890
Yeah.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.183
Hi, Laura.

04:27.266 --> 04:28.309
Hi.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.352
{\an4}BRANDON:
I didn't mean
to interrupt.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.895
I thought we had a game at 2:00.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.522
We do. And I'm there.
I was just...

04:32.605 --> 04:34.065
Warming up?

04:36.776 --> 04:37.694
{\an1}Thank you.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.196
You make me feel better.

04:42.156 --> 04:43.491
Bye.
Bye.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.496
Don't... say... a word.

04:50.456 --> 04:51.874
{\an1}Let me guess:
You were playing baseball.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.877
{\an1}You kiss her on
the strikes and she...

04:54.961 --> 04:57.213
{\an1}I know I said there wouldn't
be any body contact,

04:57.296 --> 04:59.173
{\an1}but-- when you're
rehearsing, stuff happens.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.717
{\an3}That was no rehearsal
I was watching.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.385
We were taking
a break, okay?

05:02.468 --> 05:03.886
{\an1}Mostly, I work with her.
I do.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.556
{\an1}And you know what?
I'm good at it.

05:06.639 --> 05:07.849
I think I found my calling.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.600
{\an3}What, hopping into bed
with actresses?

05:09.684 --> 05:11.227
I love show business.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.688
Ah, geez,
it's the chancellor.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.106
Behave yourself, all right?

05:15.189 --> 05:16.107
Behave myself?

05:16.190 --> 05:17.108
Brandon!

05:17.191 --> 05:18.484
{\an1}Chancellor!
I'd like you to meet

05:18.568 --> 05:20.278
my good friend,
Steve Sanders.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.237
It's an honor to meet you.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.322
You're a friend of Brandon's.

05:24.615 --> 05:27.118
Tell him it's time he stopped
going behind my back.

05:27.201 --> 05:28.578
Excuse me?

05:29.787 --> 05:31.122
Clare told me.

05:31.205 --> 05:33.416
{\an3}About her
senior prom.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.376
{\an3}I'm glad you're
taking her.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.753
{\an3}She's very
excited about it.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.464
I think she's out
shopping for a new dress.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.257
Good!

05:41.340 --> 05:43.426
Well, Friday night, then.

05:43.509 --> 05:44.719
Friday night.

05:44.802 --> 05:45.720
Nice to meet you.

05:48.222 --> 05:49.098
Clare, huh?

05:49.182 --> 05:50.600
I guess you finally figured

05:50.683 --> 05:52.393
{\an3}that a girl who handcuffs
herself to your bed

05:52.477 --> 05:54.812
{\an3}is someone you want to get
to know a little better, huh?

05:54.896 --> 05:55.897
Not exactly, Steve.

05:55.980 --> 05:58.858
{\an4}This was the first
I've heard about
the senior prom.

05:58.941 --> 06:00.151
The chancellor's daughter!

06:00.234 --> 06:01.819
Clare strikes again, huh?

06:01.903 --> 06:03.488
(playful laughter)

06:05.156 --> 06:06.407
DYLAN:
<i>Well, Kevin</i>

06:06.491 --> 06:08.117
and Suzanne are both
taking the day off,

06:08.201 --> 06:09.744
and it's Erica's
first time at the beach

06:09.827 --> 06:11.662
{\an1}since she learned how
to swim, Kel, okay?

06:11.746 --> 06:12.497
You can't back out now.

06:12.580 --> 06:13.915
This is important to me.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.625
When I said I'd go,
I didn't know

06:15.708 --> 06:17.627
that I'd be doing
callbacks right now.

06:17.710 --> 06:18.795
That's important to <i> me.</i>

06:18.878 --> 06:20.129
No one says it isn't.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.964
Nobody except Brenda.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.174
What do you expect, Kel?

06:23.257 --> 06:24.425
You guys rehearsed
together all week.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.426
Supposedly it's for her.

06:25.510 --> 06:28.221
{\an1}As it turns out,
it's for you.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.181
{\an3}The director asked me
if I would try out.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.100
{\an1}I know what
the director said, okay?

06:32.183 --> 06:34.644
{\an1}But think about it
from Bren's point of view.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.312
Why don't you ever
look at things

06:36.395 --> 06:37.772
from my point of view?

06:46.864 --> 06:49.283
Ah, there's your man.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.284
{\an1}CLARE:
Brandon!

06:50.368 --> 06:51.828
Clare.
Hi.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.330
{\an1}Your friend was
just reading my palm.

06:54.413 --> 06:56.165
She spotted my heart attack.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.209
{\an3}Ooh, just a little
late, I'd say.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.002
Steve, Clare.
Clare, Steve Sanders.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.338
If you ever need a
date for the prom

07:02.421 --> 07:03.714
{\an3}in the future,
please consider me.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.174
Oh, no.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.592
You've been talking
to my dad, haven't you?

07:06.676 --> 07:08.177
Yes.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.763
Well, I guess you two have
a little catching up to do.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.684
Thanks for the reading.

07:14.767 --> 07:15.685
{\an3}Great load
off my mind.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.311
(laughter)

07:18.980 --> 07:21.607
{\an3}I... wanted to
tell you myself.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.193
{\an1}You know Clare,
usually, it's customary

07:24.277 --> 07:26.571
to <i> ask</i> somebody if they
want to go out with you;

07:26.654 --> 07:29.198
{\an1}especially if you're talking
about going to a prom.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.368
Yeah, but... you
would've said no.

07:32.451 --> 07:35.037
Still; it's traditional.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.623
{\an3}Another reason not
to do it, right?

07:42.128 --> 07:43.379
Do you know Clare?

07:43.462 --> 07:46.174
Hmm. Intimately.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.885
We were roommates when I went
to that retreat with Brandon.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.261
Did she bring
her handcuffs?

07:50.344 --> 07:52.054
{\an3}I don't think I
want to hear this.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.681
{\an1}Fortunately, I have
to get to the theater.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.725
Whoa! I thought auditions
weren't for a couple of days.

07:55.808 --> 07:56.726
They're not.

07:56.809 --> 07:57.643
But, tonight, we get

07:57.727 --> 07:59.687
one-on-one direction
from Roy Randolph.

07:59.770 --> 08:00.855
Mm. Lovely.

08:00.938 --> 08:03.149
But, tomorrow, we're
at the beach, right?

08:04.150 --> 08:06.944
Hey... tell Laura
Kingman I said hi.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.362
{\an3}You know I'm coaching
her, don't you?

08:08.446 --> 08:10.781
Coach all you want.
It's a free country.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.742
{\an5}Well, not according
to Brenda.
KELLY:
I know.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.077
She acts like she has some
special claim on the lead.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.913
{\an3}Which is ridiculous,
when you consider the fact

08:16.996 --> 08:18.706
{\an3}that Laura's the one
with the resume.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.291
Unlike me, you mean.

08:20.374 --> 08:21.918
{\an1}That is not
what he said, Kel.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.252
{\an1}KELLY:
So Laura has Steve,

08:23.336 --> 08:25.087
and Brenda has you.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.131
Tell me, Dylan, who do I have?

08:27.215 --> 08:28.132
{\an3}Kelly...

08:28.216 --> 08:29.133
Let her go.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.760
The theater beckons.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.097
{\an1}Bye.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.600
{\an3}Callbacks.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.434
Yeah, Brenda's
comatose, too.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.895
Laura's
stopped eating.

08:40.977 --> 08:44.273
{\an3}See? Compared to an
actress, I'm a bargain.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.905
Listen up, all of you.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.448
The scene isn't just

08:52.531 --> 08:55.409
{\an1}Maggie angry
that Brick's living

08:55.493 --> 08:56.827
at the bottom
of a whisky bottle.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.330
It's not just... this.

08:59.413 --> 09:02.833
{\an1}On the contrary, she's trying
to hold things together.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.961
And what else can you do
when you find yourself

09:05.044 --> 09:07.922
wading through the seamy
underworld of an alcoholic?

09:09.674 --> 09:11.300
I take it you're acquainted

09:11.384 --> 09:14.178
with the subject?

09:14.262 --> 09:15.930
Yeah,
both my boyfriend

09:16.013 --> 09:17.098
and my mom are
recovering now.

09:17.181 --> 09:18.641
Thank God.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.643
So you tell us:

09:20.726 --> 09:22.770
What's going through
Maggie's head?

09:22.853 --> 09:26.107
{\an1}If she could reach Brick
for just one honest second,

09:26.190 --> 09:29.318
she could save them both.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.319
At least that's

09:30.403 --> 09:31.195
what she thinks.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.406
And, of course,
he'll have none of it.

09:35.032 --> 09:36.158
Kelly.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.451
You're up.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.162
Reach him.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.083
Take it from...
(clears throat)

09:44.166 --> 09:46.127
"Silence about a thing."

09:51.632 --> 09:55.553
{\an1}Silence about a thing
just magnifies it.

09:55.636 --> 09:58.014
It grows and festers
in silence,

09:58.097 --> 10:00.308
becomes malignant.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.184
Give me my crutch.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.979
Lean on <i> me.</i>

10:05.062 --> 10:07.732
{\an5}RANDOLPH:
No, just give me
my crutch.

10:07.815 --> 10:09.859
Lean on my shoulder.

10:09.942 --> 10:10.860
I don't want

10:10.943 --> 10:14.196
to lean on your shoulder,
I want my crutch.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.198
{\an3}Are you gonna
give me my crutch,

10:16.282 --> 10:18.909
or do I have to get
down on my knees

10:18.993 --> 10:20.536
on the floor and...?

10:20.620 --> 10:21.829
(crutch clatters)
Here.

10:21.912 --> 10:24.874
Take it. Take it.

10:29.712 --> 10:30.796
{\an3}Thanks.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.091
That was it.

10:35.634 --> 10:36.886
This girl is an actress.

10:39.847 --> 10:42.600
Yeah, she pretends
to be your friend.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.439
I know that the lab test

10:48.522 --> 10:50.983
{\an1}says everything's okay,
but... I don't know.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.068
I still feel strange.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.862
{\an3}Andrea, didn't Dr. Haller
say every mother-to-be

10:54.945 --> 10:57.948
{\an3}gets anxious at
one time or another?

10:58.032 --> 11:01.035
But, Jesse, I feel
anxious all the time.

11:01.118 --> 11:04.455
Well, then, I have got
exactly what you need.

11:04.538 --> 11:07.458
{\an3}One exercise video
for those with child.

11:07.541 --> 11:08.793
(both laugh)

11:08.876 --> 11:11.629
{\an3}You relax, you stretch,
you stop worrying...

11:11.712 --> 11:14.256
{\an1}This is your solution, to
put me in front of the tube?

11:14.340 --> 11:16.467
I hope you don't have this
planned for our offspring.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.219
No.

11:18.302 --> 11:20.971
And you know I would not
be going to San Francisco

11:21.055 --> 11:22.890
if I had any choice.

11:22.973 --> 11:23.974
Yeah, I know, I know.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.060
{\an1}This is the price you pay
for your federal clerkship.

11:26.143 --> 11:27.103
Yeah.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.271
{\an3}No earthquakes while
I'm gone, okay?

11:29.355 --> 11:30.773
I'll call tomorrow night.

11:30.856 --> 11:31.857
All right.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.276
{\an3}I love you.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.528
I love you.

11:35.611 --> 11:36.779
Both of you.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.490
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

11:39.573 --> 11:40.866
See ya.

11:55.923 --> 11:58.134
This yours, little boy?

11:58.217 --> 12:00.928
I didn't think you were coming.

12:01.011 --> 12:02.346
{\an1}I wasn't.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.307
But last night, I was
rehearsing this scene,

12:05.391 --> 12:07.101
{\an1}and everybody
was watching...

12:07.184 --> 12:08.811
ERICA:
Hey, Dylan, come here!

12:08.894 --> 12:10.855
{\an3}Okay, I'm coming.
Just a second.

12:10.938 --> 12:13.190
{\an1}It was the strangest
thing, Dylan.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.984
I'll tell you what, Kel,

12:15.067 --> 12:16.861
why don't we increase
the peace here, huh?

12:16.944 --> 12:18.112
When we discuss the play.

12:18.195 --> 12:20.614
{\an1}I wanted to tell you
how my rehearsal went.

12:20.698 --> 12:21.490
You can do that later.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.200
{\an3}Right now, I want you
to meet Kevin.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.035
{\an3}Come on.

12:25.119 --> 12:28.205
{\an5}Kevin Weaver,
this is Kelly Taylor.
Hi, Kelly.

12:28.289 --> 12:31.000
{\an4}Hi. Yeah, I've seen you
at the Peach Pit.
That's no surprise.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.003
{\an6}It's sort of become
home base since
I met Suzanne.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.963
{\an1}DYLAN:
Listen, Kevin and I

12:36.046 --> 12:38.174
were gonna take a little walk
down the beach here

12:38.257 --> 12:41.135
and see some of that sludge
that rolls out into the bay.

12:41.218 --> 12:43.512
{\an1}You came to the beach
to see sewage?

12:43.596 --> 12:46.348
It's an occupational hazard--
I'm an environmental chemist.

12:46.432 --> 12:49.185
(laughs)
Excuse me.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.728
We'll be gone
about an hour.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.688
{\an1}Can you live without me
for that long?

12:52.771 --> 12:54.690
Definitely.
Thank you!

12:54.774 --> 12:57.067
Sure. We girls
will have a blast.

12:58.777 --> 13:01.071
Come on, let's go.

13:03.073 --> 13:05.409
It's just an hour, okay?

13:13.292 --> 13:16.045
Don't forget the Peach Pit
sorority meeting tonight.

13:16.128 --> 13:19.048
{\an3}Oh, I have auditions
tomorrow; I can't.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.674
{\an3}Sorry, no time
for socializing.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.885
You mean socializing with Kelly.

13:22.968 --> 13:23.886
You said it, I didn't.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.388
Although she did hit
an all-time low when she

13:26.472 --> 13:29.058
pulled out her lost-child-of-
an-alcoholic act at rehearsal.

13:29.141 --> 13:32.061
She was crying so hard I thought
we were all gonna drown.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.104
Yeah, well, it must've been
pretty painful for her.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.857
Yeah, it really hurts
being the director's favorite.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.442
{\an1}Bren...

13:40.444 --> 13:42.738
DONNA:
There's Roy and Laura now.

13:42.821 --> 13:45.032
I suppose Laura's
a sleaze now, too?

13:45.115 --> 13:48.118
No. She is just trying
to keep up with the leader.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.287
{\an3}Which is exactly what
I should be doing. Bye.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.497
Wait.

13:54.333 --> 13:58.045
(groans):
I just love eating alone.

13:59.630 --> 14:02.049
{\an1}So you're telling me
that bacteria can eat up

14:02.132 --> 14:04.093
{\an1}all that sludge
we just saw down there?

14:04.176 --> 14:07.137
{\an6}Absolutely-- you just
have to build yourself
the right kind of organism.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.265
{\an1}Well, get to the building
organism, will ya?

14:09.348 --> 14:12.768
{\an4}Every time it rains,
I can't go in the water
for two weeks.

14:12.851 --> 14:16.105
{\an3}Yeah. The bay sure looks
beautiful today, doesn't it?

14:16.188 --> 14:17.773
Not in this bottle.

14:17.856 --> 14:19.858
Know what else
is beautiful?

14:21.610 --> 14:24.572
{\an4}KEVIN:
What is it that girls
always talk about anyway?

14:24.655 --> 14:26.824
I don't know.

14:26.907 --> 14:29.243
Let's go find out.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.163
Hey, sorry we took so long.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.040
What kept you?

14:35.124 --> 14:37.001
Well, it was kind of
my fault, actually.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.044
{\an1}I got talking to Kevin
about his job,

14:39.128 --> 14:40.838
{\an1}and I'll tell you, it's
pretty fascinating stuff.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.007
Well, if I'm not mistaken,
you promised to take me

14:43.090 --> 14:45.175
for a walk up the beach,
Mr. Weaver.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.136
And I never break a promise.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.638
{\an3}Then will someone
go swimming with me?

14:49.722 --> 14:51.640
{\an6}You want to
go swimming?
With us?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.309
KEVIN:
We could take you swimming!

14:53.392 --> 14:56.145
(Erica squeals)
To the ocean!

14:56.228 --> 14:58.147
(Suzanne, Erica laughing)

14:58.230 --> 15:00.190
{\an1}I was beginning
to think your sister

15:00.274 --> 15:02.693
{\an1}was part of a government plot
to drive me nuts.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.194
Kel, what is it
with you lately?

15:04.278 --> 15:06.155
{\an3}I mean, yesterday, you're
bagging on Brenda and Steve,

15:06.238 --> 15:07.489
{\an3}and today, you can
barely be civil.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.658
{\an1}Well, I came to the beach
to be with you,

15:09.742 --> 15:11.160
{\an1}not be dumped
with Suzanne and Erica.

15:11.243 --> 15:14.163
Well, if that's the way you
feel about my little sister,

15:14.246 --> 15:15.873
{\an3}you shouldn't
have come at all.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.126
{\an1}You know, Dylan,
the minute I tried

15:19.209 --> 15:21.170
{\an1}to talk to you
about my rehearsal...

15:21.253 --> 15:23.047
{\an3}What, I don't want to hear
about the same fights

15:23.130 --> 15:25.132
{\an6}you've been having with
Brenda for two years?
No, I don't.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.176
{\an1}No, that's not
what this is about.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.178
Well, then what is
it about, Kel, huh?

15:29.261 --> 15:31.013
{\an3}Is it about the play?
The twit director?

15:31.096 --> 15:33.390
The way you come alive in
the glow of the spotlight?

15:33.474 --> 15:35.184
{\an3}Come on, you're behaving
like an actress.

15:35.267 --> 15:36.977
{\an3}And you know what?
I'm not really

15:37.061 --> 15:38.228
that interested.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.688
{\an1}I know you're not
interested, I know.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.316
{\an1}It's okay for Brenda,
but it's not okay for me?

15:42.399 --> 15:44.860
{\an3}That is exactly what I'm
talking about right there.

15:44.943 --> 15:45.861
Thanks for listening.

15:45.944 --> 15:48.322
You know what, if you're
gonna clean up the bay,

15:48.405 --> 15:49.740
{\an1}maybe you should
start with yourself.

15:58.749 --> 16:02.294
♪♪

16:02.378 --> 16:04.254
{\an1}You know, with Jesse gone,
I've been climbing the walls.

16:04.338 --> 16:07.216
I can't tell you how great it is
to talk to another human being.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.884
{\an6}Thank you.
Well, it's
just too bad

16:08.967 --> 16:10.219
Brenda and Kelly
aren't speaking.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.221
{\an3}You could've had
all three of us here.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.264
{\an1}Well, callbacks are tomorrow;
it'll be over soon.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.183
{\an3}I don't know, I mean,
you should've heard

16:16.266 --> 16:18.686
{\an3}the way Brenda was dumping
on Kelly at lunch.

16:18.769 --> 16:21.230
{\an6}It's just kind of scary--
it's like whatever
held us together

16:21.313 --> 16:24.441
in high school is gone, and
everyone's different, and...

16:24.525 --> 16:26.694
{\an3}it's just all
catching up to us now.

16:26.777 --> 16:29.905
Well, if it's any comfort,

16:29.988 --> 16:33.909
{\an1}despite my ever-expanding
waistline, I'm still the same.

16:33.992 --> 16:35.119
Are you kidding?

16:35.202 --> 16:36.245
{\an3}You've changed
more than anyone.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.956
{\an1}No, I haven't, not deep down,
not where it's important.

16:39.039 --> 16:42.167
Andrea, a year ago, you were
a virgin on your way to Yale.

16:42.251 --> 16:45.587
{\an6}And then there was Dan,
and then Jesse, and
now you're pregnant.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.257
I don't think the girl
you were a year ago

16:48.340 --> 16:49.425
would even recognize you now.
(gentle laugh)

16:49.508 --> 16:51.135
Look, Donna,
if you want to see me

16:51.218 --> 16:53.220
as someone who slept around
and got knocked up,

16:53.303 --> 16:54.430
I can't stop that.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.098
That's not what I meant.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.933
Yeah, but that's
exactly what you said.

16:58.016 --> 17:01.103
{\an1}Look, I liked being virgins
with you, okay, I really did.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.855
{\an1}But I can't keep
that going anymore.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.272
I'm pregnant, I'm married.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.191
I know, and that's
all I was saying.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.403
{\an1}Look, I just needed
somebody to talk to today.

17:09.486 --> 17:10.487
{\an3}Andrea...

17:10.570 --> 17:12.196
No. It's been real.

17:16.242 --> 17:18.287
(sighs)

17:18.369 --> 17:20.372
(crickets chirping)

17:22.540 --> 17:24.585
(rings doorbell)

17:26.545 --> 17:28.255
Brandon.
Chancellor.

17:28.338 --> 17:29.381
Come in.
Thanks.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.300
Clare'll be down
in just a second.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.762
{\an3}Uh, I hope this isn't
awkward for you,

17:34.845 --> 17:36.263
because it's not for me.

17:36.346 --> 17:37.473
I'm delighted.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.808
No, no, no, I'm, uh...

17:42.936 --> 17:45.230
I'm delighted, too.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.611
Well, is someone
gonna say something?

17:50.694 --> 17:52.613
{\an3}You look
beautiful, honey.

17:52.696 --> 17:56.158
Seldom wrong, and right again,
Chancellor.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.160
{\an1}Oh, Brandon,
you shouldn't have.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.661
It's beautiful.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.663
{\an3}I've <i> got</i> to
get a picture.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.165
Just a second.

18:03.248 --> 18:06.418
{\an1}I can't believe you bought me
one of these wrist things.

18:06.502 --> 18:07.669
You're so funny.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.963
{\an3}Actually, uh, you
know what's funny is

18:10.047 --> 18:11.799
{\an3}that, uh, I don't
dance at all,

18:11.882 --> 18:14.176
so I hope you don't
mind standing around

18:14.259 --> 18:16.470
drinking punch all night.

18:16.553 --> 18:18.180
You don't actually think
I'd waste an all-nighter

18:18.263 --> 18:20.182
{\an1}at a high school
dance, do you?

18:20.265 --> 18:23.227
{\an3}CHANCELLOR: Okay, I'll make
this as painless as possible.

18:23.310 --> 18:26.355
All right... smile.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.191
That was nice,

18:29.274 --> 18:31.568
but could you just move
a little closer together.

18:31.652 --> 18:34.279
(groans)

18:36.115 --> 18:38.492
{\an1}(quietly): You're in

18:51.839 --> 18:54.716
Clare, you finally made it! Hi!

18:54.800 --> 18:56.510
Yeah, we had to stop off
at the prom

18:56.593 --> 18:58.053
for our official Kodak moment.

18:58.136 --> 18:59.388
Wow, one of those

18:59.471 --> 19:02.224
high school dance
corsages! Cool!

19:02.307 --> 19:04.393
Y-Yeah, uh, Brandon,
this is Renee.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.270
{\an3}Hi, Renee.
Where's Peter?

19:06.353 --> 19:11.066
Ha-ha-ho!
Tequila makes me crazy!

19:11.149 --> 19:12.401
{\an3}How you doing, man?
I'm Brandon.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.486
Oh, yeah.
Peter, Peter, Peter.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.613
{\an1}Uh, Clare told us she
tricked you into coming, huh?

19:16.697 --> 19:19.741
{\an1}Thanks! You promised
you wouldn't tell anyone.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.452
Well, you both
already know.

Dance with me.

19:27.165 --> 19:28.584
{\an1}Come on, let's get
some champagne.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.253
Uh, actually, Clare, I'm not big
on drinking and driving.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.255
I wrapped my car around a truck

19:33.338 --> 19:36.550
{\an1}about three years ago, during
a party just like this one.

19:36.633 --> 19:40.220
Oh. So you <i> did</i> have a
wild and crazy period.

19:40.304 --> 19:43.307
{\an3}Just think, if you
hadn't given that up

19:43.390 --> 19:47.060
and become a model citizen,
I would never have met you.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.301
Absolutely.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.470
Okay. Bye.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.640
{\an1}CLARE:
Whoo-hoo!

20:24.723 --> 20:27.392
(laughter, indistinct chatter)

20:30.354 --> 20:32.522
When in Rome...

20:37.194 --> 20:38.946
(crickets chirping)

20:39.029 --> 20:41.490
I wish you could talk to me.

20:41.573 --> 20:45.285
And I don't mean
dog biscuits and liver treats.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.828
(door opens)

20:48.580 --> 20:50.499
You got a pal there?

20:52.250 --> 20:54.544
{\an3}Well, at least he
pretends to listen.

20:54.628 --> 20:57.005
{\an3}I'm not in the mood for
Tennessee Williams tonight.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.050
{\an1}Well, I wish you could've come
to the Peach Pit with me.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.219
You could've stopped me
from tormenting Andrea

21:02.302 --> 21:03.387
about getting pregnant.

21:03.470 --> 21:05.097
Why'd you do that?

21:05.180 --> 21:07.265
I don't know;
I had all these feelings

21:07.349 --> 21:09.184
about her sexual revolution.

21:09.267 --> 21:10.519
Then all this horrible stuff

21:10.602 --> 21:12.521
just kind of
burst out of nowhere.

21:12.604 --> 21:13.855
Well, I know <i> that</i> feeling.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.524
Yeah, I guess

21:15.607 --> 21:17.192
it's going around--
Brenda has it, too.

21:17.275 --> 21:19.361
Tell me about it.

21:19.444 --> 21:23.532
{\an1}The only reason I am
in this whole mess is 'cause

21:23.615 --> 21:26.660
{\an5}I thought it would
be fun to try out for
a play <i> with</i> Brenda.

21:26.743 --> 21:29.162
And it <i> was</i> fun, until
the director decided

21:29.246 --> 21:32.374
{\an6}that he liked me as
the tortured desperate
Maggie character.

21:32.457 --> 21:33.667
Well, you're great at it.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.752
I don't want to
be great at it.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.379
{\an3}I want to
forget about it.

21:37.462 --> 21:40.090
Crying on cue is not
my idea of a good time.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.009
{\an1}So, then why are
you doing it?

21:42.092 --> 21:44.261
{\an1}I mean, it's just
a college play.

21:44.344 --> 21:45.887
{\an3}(sighs):
I don't know.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.848
{\an3}Maybe the only reason
that I'm hanging on

21:47.931 --> 21:50.225
is because Brenda told me
I should forget about it.

21:50.308 --> 21:52.519
So it <i> is</i> Brenda.

21:52.602 --> 21:55.063
And when Dylan sides with
her, it drives me crazy.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.107
Well, no one says
you have to be a martyr,

21:57.190 --> 21:58.108
just back off World War III.

21:58.191 --> 22:01.069
{\an3}Hey, I'm not the one
who came howling in here.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.238
{\an1}Look, Brenda is not
a threat to you.

22:03.321 --> 22:05.407
{\an1}It's more like
the other way around.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.701
{\an3}That's the way
<i>you</i> see it.

22:07.784 --> 22:11.038
No, actually, that's
the way <i> she</i> sees it.

22:11.121 --> 22:12.330
She told me.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.166
{\an1}She said she's still
screwed up about

22:14.249 --> 22:15.125
losing Dylan to you.

22:15.208 --> 22:17.294
{\an1}And now with the play,
I mean, think about it--

22:17.377 --> 22:18.420
who's under attack?

22:19.629 --> 22:20.881
I don't know.

22:20.964 --> 22:22.549
The poor pregnant woman
you tortured?

22:32.476 --> 22:35.645
{\an3}Well, I guess tequila makes
Clare crazy, too, huh?

22:35.729 --> 22:37.814
{\an1}Naw, she doesn't
really drink.

22:37.898 --> 22:39.232
Doesn't need to.

22:39.316 --> 22:41.443
Mwah.
Hi!

22:42.736 --> 22:44.696
{\an3}You mean she's
naturally perfect?

22:48.200 --> 22:50.285
{\an1}Hey, Brandon,
come on, dance with me.

22:50.368 --> 22:52.287
{\an1}Oh, right, you don't
dance-- I forgot.

22:52.370 --> 22:54.289
Especially
not for strangers.

22:54.372 --> 22:55.749
They're not strangers.

22:55.832 --> 22:58.126
{\an3}They've been gawking at me
for, like, ten minutes.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.462
Whoo!

23:00.545 --> 23:01.838
(laughing)

23:01.922 --> 23:03.757
Hey, dollface,
what's the room number up there?

23:03.840 --> 23:06.009
Wouldn't you like to know?

23:06.093 --> 23:09.221
Ladies, maybe we should relax
for a minute, here, huh?

23:09.304 --> 23:11.264
It's 308!

23:11.348 --> 23:13.767
Are you crazy?

23:13.850 --> 23:14.935
Hey, big guy!

23:15.018 --> 23:16.895
Thirsty?

23:18.063 --> 23:19.773
{\an1}CLARE:
Whoo!

23:19.856 --> 23:21.775
{\an5}CLARE:
Oh, my gosh,
they're coming in.

23:21.858 --> 23:23.443
{\an3}Come on, we gotta
lock the door.

23:24.444 --> 23:25.362
Oh, man...

23:25.445 --> 23:26.530
She's insane.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.573
Oh, isn't it great?

23:28.657 --> 23:30.617
(mumbling, laughing)

23:31.743 --> 23:33.161
(pounding)

23:33.245 --> 23:34.162
Open up the door!

23:34.246 --> 23:34.871
{\an3}Come on,
we want to party!

23:34.955 --> 23:36.665
{\an1}Listen, guys,
if we're quiet,

23:36.748 --> 23:39.042
{\an5}maybe they'll
just leave, okay?
Yeah, right.

23:39.126 --> 23:41.211
Does it really sound like
they're gonna leave?

23:41.294 --> 23:42.546
(pounding on door)

23:47.759 --> 23:49.636
{\an3}Sorry, guys, this
is a private party.

23:49.719 --> 23:51.012
Yeah, well, uh...
we were invited.

23:51.096 --> 23:53.890
{\an6}BRANDON:
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.234
(giggles)

24:04.317 --> 24:06.069
{\an6}What, am I some kind
of joke to you?
Is that what I am?

24:06.153 --> 24:08.697
{\an1}Come on, nobody thinks
you're a joke, man.

24:08.780 --> 24:09.906
Oh, yeah, well, your
skanky friend does.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.658
{\an3}Look, why don't you
just leave, all right?

24:11.741 --> 24:13.952
Or what, huh?

24:14.035 --> 24:15.453
{\an3}What were you
trying to show me

24:15.537 --> 24:16.663
{\an3}under that little
dress of yours?

24:16.746 --> 24:18.206
Listen, guys,

24:18.290 --> 24:20.792
{\an1}I think it might be better
if you just left, okay?

24:29.759 --> 24:31.553
Hey! Break it up!

24:31.636 --> 24:32.721
Break it up!

24:32.804 --> 24:33.889
Gentlemen...

24:33.972 --> 24:35.807
{\an3}you leave quietly
right now

24:35.891 --> 24:37.684
{\an4}and we can forget
the whole thing.
The "gentlemen"

24:37.767 --> 24:39.686
just tried to kill us.

24:41.354 --> 24:42.814
Big damn joke.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.816
{\an3}I said quietly,
right now.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.363
You okay?

24:50.447 --> 24:52.282
Yeah. Fine. Thanks.

24:54.034 --> 24:57.037
MANAGER:
Quite an expensive mess.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.581
{\an3}I'm gonna call
my father, all right?

24:59.664 --> 25:00.582
He'll take care of it.

25:00.665 --> 25:02.042
{\an1}No, we are not
calling your father.

25:02.125 --> 25:03.919
You're doing something.

25:04.002 --> 25:05.921
{\an1}(sighs heavily):
We'll take care of it.

25:06.004 --> 25:08.131
Fine.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.466
{\an3}Everyone else,
the party's over.

25:09.549 --> 25:11.384
{\an3}The doorman will be
putting you in taxis.

25:11.468 --> 25:12.302
(guests murmuring, groaning)

25:12.385 --> 25:14.137
Let's go, now,

25:14.221 --> 25:15.805
before I lose
my patience.

25:25.398 --> 25:28.360
Alone at last.

25:34.491 --> 25:35.909
WOMAN (on TV):
Exhale... whew!

25:35.992 --> 25:37.118
Take everything
over to your right.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.954
Stretch over.

25:39.037 --> 25:41.164
Make sure both fingertips
are reaching out,

25:41.248 --> 25:43.375
top of the head is reaching;
don't drop over here.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.794
Keep it lifted,
keep the shoulder back.

25:45.877 --> 25:47.170
(doorbell rings)

25:47.254 --> 25:48.922
Now circle that top arm back.

25:49.005 --> 25:50.131
(turns off video)

25:54.886 --> 25:57.305
Hi. Can I come in?

25:57.389 --> 25:59.140
On one condition:

25:59.224 --> 26:01.184
{\an3}We forget what happened
at the Peach Pit.

26:01.268 --> 26:04.145
Well, then you'll miss
my apology.

26:04.229 --> 26:06.439
And you'll miss mine.

26:06.523 --> 26:07.899
I'm sorry, Donna.

26:07.983 --> 26:08.984
I was going
to call you.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.944
My hormones have been
raging lately.

26:11.027 --> 26:12.237
No one's safe.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.949
Would you like some ice cream?

26:16.032 --> 26:18.535
Always.

26:23.873 --> 26:25.208
Are you all right?

26:25.292 --> 26:26.793
Andrea, what's wrong?

26:26.876 --> 26:28.962
I think I'm going into labor.

26:29.045 --> 26:30.839
Okay, where's
the doctor's number?

26:30.922 --> 26:32.299
It's by the phone.

26:39.764 --> 26:42.100
Yes, Dr. Haller, please.

26:42.183 --> 26:43.810
Yes, could you page her?

26:43.893 --> 26:45.854
Andrea Zuckerman.

26:45.937 --> 26:48.064
Oh, no.

26:48.148 --> 26:49.858
Uh...
when she calls, can you tell her

26:49.941 --> 26:51.651
we're leaving for the hospital
right now?

26:51.735 --> 26:53.486
Thanks.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.989
Oh, this isn't
supposed to be happening.

26:56.072 --> 26:57.032
They said I was all right.

26:57.115 --> 26:58.825
{\an3}You'll be okay.
Don't worry.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.161
(gasps, groans)

27:01.244 --> 27:03.830
{\an5}(cries):
I think I'm losing
the baby.

27:03.913 --> 27:04.998
No, you're not.

27:05.081 --> 27:07.250
{\an3}Just hang in there.
We're on our way.

27:12.630 --> 27:14.049
{\an5}STEVE:
<i>Come here, Laura.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

27:14.132 --> 27:16.760
{\an3}(switch clicks)
Now,

27:16.843 --> 27:18.261
soak it up.

27:18.345 --> 27:21.014
{\an1}It'll be just like
this tomorrow.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.269
Why am I so catty?

27:26.353 --> 27:31.066
'Cause I'm consumed with envy
and eaten up with longing.

27:31.149 --> 27:33.777
Dare to be great.

27:33.860 --> 27:38.073
Hey, just show him what
we both know you've got.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.492
Now there's just
one final touch.

27:47.123 --> 27:49.042
I don't think it's me.

27:49.125 --> 27:51.461
It's not you.

27:51.544 --> 27:53.880
It's Maggie.

27:53.963 --> 27:56.883
{\an1}You mean wear this
to the audition?

27:56.966 --> 27:58.968
{\an3}Well, my mom got
rave reviews in it,

27:59.052 --> 28:01.054
{\an3}when she did
Tennessee Williams.

28:01.137 --> 28:04.057
This is it, Laura.

28:04.140 --> 28:08.186
A good actress has to take it
all the way.

28:12.899 --> 28:15.485
(man clears throat
in distance)

28:17.821 --> 28:19.781
We'll be done
in 30 seconds, okay?

28:24.411 --> 28:26.621
How do you feel?

28:26.704 --> 28:29.791
{\an1}Like a cat
on a hot tin roof.

28:31.167 --> 28:32.168
Come on.

28:35.088 --> 28:37.006
{\an1}CLARE:
Brandon, can I come in?

28:40.885 --> 28:43.304
I straightened the place up.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.098
Congratulations.

28:45.181 --> 28:48.059
{\an3}It's a good thing I got my
friends to leave dough, huh?

28:48.143 --> 28:50.979
{\an1}Yeah, they only
came up $300 short.

28:51.062 --> 28:55.024
{\an3}I told you I'll pay
you back, okay?

28:55.108 --> 28:56.276
{\an3}Look, you know,
I should have just

28:56.359 --> 28:58.278
{\an3}called my dad,
like I said.

28:58.361 --> 29:00.280
And told him what?

29:00.363 --> 29:03.116
That some guy you flashed
from a hotel balcony

29:03.199 --> 29:04.868
decided to take you up
on your offer?

29:04.951 --> 29:06.828
Or that I was stupid enough
to let it happen?

29:06.911 --> 29:09.998
{\an3}No, I thought we could just
make something up, okay?

29:10.081 --> 29:13.126
Yeah, you would.

29:15.295 --> 29:16.337
(door slams)

29:37.567 --> 29:40.653
Clare...

29:40.737 --> 29:42.655
{\an1}it's been
a rough night.

29:46.784 --> 29:48.161
You know, the balcony
didn't work out

29:48.244 --> 29:49.704
so well for you last time.

29:49.787 --> 29:52.165
{\an1}Maybe you want
to get off.

29:52.248 --> 29:56.211
{\an6}(voice breaking):
Yeah, maybe I should
just jump off.

29:56.294 --> 29:59.756
God, I hate my life.

29:59.839 --> 30:04.219
I hate it.

30:04.302 --> 30:07.222
{\an3}I just want you
to care about me.

30:07.305 --> 30:09.891
I do care.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.893
No, you don't.

30:11.976 --> 30:15.021
You just said
that you don't.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.531
So, you want to go home now?

30:24.614 --> 30:28.743
{\an3}I want to strangle myself
with my own hands.

30:28.826 --> 30:32.163
I don't think
that's physically possible.

30:37.293 --> 30:39.546
You know...

30:39.629 --> 30:43.174
a hotel room like this is
a terrible thing to waste.

30:45.927 --> 30:48.054
It's already been wasted, Clare.

30:50.306 --> 30:52.058
Ow, ow.

30:52.141 --> 30:53.601
(chuckles)

30:56.312 --> 31:00.066
Maybe I should just
take you home, huh?

31:00.149 --> 31:01.859
Yeah.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.152
Come on.

31:06.072 --> 31:09.117
(siren wailing)

31:09.200 --> 31:12.245
{\an3}This is a terbutaline
injection to stop the labor.

31:12.328 --> 31:14.998
{\an3}We'll put you on
a pill form tomorrow.

31:15.081 --> 31:17.292
{\an3}Andrea, are you
listening?

31:17.375 --> 31:19.294
{\an1}I knew everything
wasn't fine.

31:19.377 --> 31:22.297
Well, you might feel
a few more flutters,

31:22.380 --> 31:24.632
{\an3}and you've got some heavy-duty
bed rest in your future,

31:24.716 --> 31:26.593
but everything
should be fine.

31:26.676 --> 31:28.094
Well, that's exactly
what my O.B. told me

31:28.177 --> 31:29.178
the day before yesterday.

31:29.262 --> 31:29.971
She might
tell you that again

31:30.054 --> 31:30.930
when she examines you
tomorrow.

31:31.014 --> 31:34.183
{\an3}I know this is not
very comforting to hear,

31:34.267 --> 31:37.228
but these things happen.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.938
I wish Jesse was here.

31:39.022 --> 31:41.149
We'll keep you a few more hours,
then you'll be on your way.

31:41.232 --> 31:42.775
And then what?

31:42.859 --> 31:44.152
{\an3}And then I will watch
you every second

31:44.235 --> 31:46.154
{\an3}for the next three months,
till the baby's born.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.530
You've got
a good friend there.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.035
Thank you, Donna.

31:52.118 --> 31:53.494
Oh...

31:53.578 --> 31:55.288
I don't know what to say.

31:55.371 --> 31:57.290
Shh. Just rest.

32:02.629 --> 32:05.131
(doorbell rings)

32:07.216 --> 32:08.134
{\an1}JIM:
Brenda?

32:08.217 --> 32:10.219
I got it, Dad.

32:13.264 --> 32:16.184
Shouldn't you be getting ready
for your big callback?

32:16.267 --> 32:18.311
I'm dropping out.

32:18.394 --> 32:19.562
You are?

32:19.646 --> 32:21.314
{\an1}JIM:
Brenda, who is it?

32:21.397 --> 32:22.357
It's just Kelly, Dad.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.108
{\an3}You can go
back to sleep.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.195
{\an3}Anyway,

32:27.278 --> 32:29.197
I just thought you should know.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.698
Good luck.

32:30.782 --> 32:35.078
Whoa. Wait a minute.

32:35.161 --> 32:37.163
What did Randolph say?

32:37.246 --> 32:38.915
I haven't told him yet.

32:38.998 --> 32:41.417
{\an1}Well, look, I don't want to
change your mind, believe me,

32:41.501 --> 32:43.211
but I don't want
Randolph thinking

32:43.294 --> 32:45.171
{\an1}that I sabotaged
his favorite actress.

32:45.254 --> 32:48.341
{\an3}I don't want
to be an actress.

32:48.424 --> 32:50.343
I never wanted to be one.

32:50.426 --> 32:54.180
{\an1}So then why did you put
yourself through all this?

32:54.263 --> 32:57.725
I don't know.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.728
(sighs heavily)

33:00.812 --> 33:05.817
It's like... every time
something good happens to you,

33:05.900 --> 33:09.570
part of me feels like
I'm getting left behind.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.906
I don't know.

33:11.989 --> 33:13.866
{\an3}Forget it;
I can't explain it.

33:15.201 --> 33:17.370
Well, how do you think
I felt in high school

33:17.453 --> 33:19.288
{\an1}when you were voted,
like, spring queen

33:19.372 --> 33:21.249
{\an1}and most beautiful
and everything else?

33:21.332 --> 33:23.584
I thought you said that stuff
didn't matter to you.

33:23.668 --> 33:27.213
I couldn't let you know
how jealous I was, now, could I?

33:27.296 --> 33:32.301
I should have known we were
in trouble the first day we met.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.554
Remember, we went shopping
after school

33:34.637 --> 33:38.891
{\an3}and you spotted that
amazing spangley jacket,

33:38.975 --> 33:41.894
and I was the one
who ended up taking it home.

33:41.978 --> 33:44.939
Yeah, well, I would have been
totally crushed

33:45.022 --> 33:47.525
if you didn't think
it was worth having.

33:47.608 --> 33:51.446
I always wanted you
to have the role of Maggie,

33:51.529 --> 33:53.948
and I still do,

33:54.031 --> 33:57.118
so if there's anything I can do
to help or whatever...

33:57.201 --> 33:59.954
Well, if you're offering to help
me rehearse, I'd love it.

34:00.037 --> 34:00.955
You would?

34:01.038 --> 34:02.373
{\an1}Yes.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.125
And we can compare notes
on what it's like

34:04.208 --> 34:05.209
to have an alcoholic boyfriend.

34:05.293 --> 34:09.338
Yeah, we can put the "fun"
back in dysfunctional.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.299
{\an3}Come on.
When we're done,

34:11.382 --> 34:12.675
Randolph won't know
what hit him.

34:26.397 --> 34:29.233
Breakfast is served.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.485
You know, I was trying
to find a passage in there

34:31.569 --> 34:33.571
that would tell me
what happened to me was common,

34:33.654 --> 34:35.322
but I don't know,
I just can't find it.

34:35.406 --> 34:38.409
Well, don't start
worrying on me again.

34:39.452 --> 34:40.286
(gently):
Jesse...

34:40.369 --> 34:42.163
(quietly):
Hey, baby...

34:42.246 --> 34:44.373
I'm so sorry.

34:44.456 --> 34:47.126
Oh... Oh, I'm so
glad you're here.

34:47.210 --> 34:48.628
{\an1}It's okay to hold you,
isn't it?

34:48.710 --> 34:50.420
Yes, I'm fine.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.380
{\an3}At least that's what
Donna keeps telling me.

34:52.465 --> 34:53.841
{\an3}She's starting
to convince me, too.

34:53.925 --> 34:57.178
{\an1}Thanks for calling me
up there, Donna.

34:57.261 --> 34:59.138
{\an4}Andrea's always told me
how you're everyone's
guardian angel.

34:59.222 --> 35:01.682
Yeah, some angel.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.351
Donna, what's wrong?

35:03.434 --> 35:07.063
Well, I just started thinking
last night that...

35:08.231 --> 35:10.483
...well, maybe all that stuff
I said to you

35:10.566 --> 35:12.318
in the Peach Pit
caused this to happen.

35:14.403 --> 35:16.572
{\an3}Donna, I knew something was
wrong before Jesse left.

35:16.656 --> 35:18.533
It had nothing
to do with you.

35:18.616 --> 35:20.243
{\an1}Donna, you got her
through it.

35:20.326 --> 35:22.829
{\an1}You got her smiling
for the first time in weeks.

35:22.912 --> 35:25.331
Well, I'm just glad
you're having this baby.

35:25.414 --> 35:28.042
Yeah, me, too.

35:32.421 --> 35:35.925
{\an1}Remember, the operative word
is "desperate."

35:36.008 --> 35:37.885
Good, 'cause I'm feeling
pretty desperate.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.178
You'll be fine.

35:39.262 --> 35:40.179
Guess what?

35:40.263 --> 35:41.597
It's show time.

35:43.099 --> 35:45.560
{\an1}Laura and Roy
look pretty cozy.

35:45.643 --> 35:46.561
Don't worry about it.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.104
You're the one to beat.

35:49.939 --> 35:52.233
Hail, hail, the gang's all here.

35:52.316 --> 35:53.568
Eddie will take you down

35:53.651 --> 35:54.569
into the theater.

35:54.652 --> 35:56.863
I'll see you
all shortly.

35:56.946 --> 35:58.364
Mesdames...

36:06.497 --> 36:08.374
Well, destiny awaits.

36:08.457 --> 36:10.293
Someone else's destiny.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.378
I've decided not to try out.

36:12.461 --> 36:13.754
You can't be serious.

36:13.838 --> 36:14.922
Yeah, I am.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.966
I wanted to come and tell you,

36:17.049 --> 36:18.092
and also thank you
for everything.

36:18.175 --> 36:21.304
I'm only going to say this once,
so listen carefully.

36:21.387 --> 36:24.640
I can lift you out
of your frivolous little life

36:24.724 --> 36:27.435
{\an3}of sorority parties
and study dates.

36:27.518 --> 36:29.061
I can make you into something.

36:29.145 --> 36:30.438
I've done it before.

36:30.521 --> 36:34.192
All you have to do is be
smart enough to say "yes."

36:34.275 --> 36:37.570
The only reason I was ever
trying out was because...

36:37.653 --> 36:38.529
{\an3}Do what you
have to,

36:38.613 --> 36:41.866
but spare me
your little rationalizations.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.417
{\an3}You could've been
a contender.

36:58.507 --> 37:00.259
Is it safe yet?

37:00.343 --> 37:03.262
What a weird guy.

37:03.346 --> 37:05.640
{\an3}Brandon, what
happened to you?

37:05.723 --> 37:07.516
I went on a date with Clare.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.769
Oh. Was it fun?

37:09.852 --> 37:11.479
Hardly, but I think
she's finally realized

37:11.562 --> 37:13.773
I'm after a Clare-free
environment.

37:13.856 --> 37:15.566
{\an1}Come on, I think
they're gonna start.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.526
{\an3}Okay.

37:33.751 --> 37:34.669
{\an1}RANDOLPH:
Laura.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.587
I'll take you first.

37:38.422 --> 37:39.423
Good luck.

37:46.222 --> 37:47.515
When you're ready.

37:47.598 --> 37:48.683
Take your time.

38:04.657 --> 38:09.203
You were a wonderful lover.

38:09.286 --> 38:12.999
Such a wonderful person
to go to bed with

38:13.082 --> 38:18.337
and I think, mostly, because you
were really indifferent to it.

38:18.421 --> 38:20.506
Isn't that right?

38:20.589 --> 38:24.176
Never had any anxiety about it,

38:24.260 --> 38:27.388
just did it naturally...

38:27.471 --> 38:32.560
easily... slowly...

38:32.643 --> 38:36.230
absolute confidence
and complete calm.

38:36.313 --> 38:37.690
More like you...

38:37.773 --> 38:39.108
That's Laura?!

38:39.191 --> 38:42.570
{\an1}I told you I've been working
wonders on her psyche.

38:42.653 --> 38:44.030
{\an1}I'll say.

38:44.113 --> 38:45.698
{\an1}She must've felt
just fine about herself

38:45.781 --> 38:48.576
{\an1}when she picked out
that dress.

38:48.659 --> 38:51.245
{\an1}LAURA:
Strange...

38:51.328 --> 38:52.246
{\an1}but true.

38:52.329 --> 38:54.206
{\an3}You know,

38:54.290 --> 38:57.209
{\an1}if I thought you would
never, never, never

38:57.293 --> 38:58.711
make love to me again,

38:58.794 --> 39:01.547
I would go downstairs
to the kitchen and pick out

39:01.630 --> 39:04.216
the longest, and the sharpest
knife I could find

39:04.300 --> 39:06.218
and stick it
straight into my heart...

39:06.302 --> 39:09.597
I swear that I would.

39:09.680 --> 39:16.479
{\an5}LAURA (in distance):
But one thing I don't have is
the charm of the defeated.

39:16.562 --> 39:18.606
My hat is still in the ring,

39:18.689 --> 39:21.484
and I am determined to win!

39:21.567 --> 39:26.447
{\an1}What is the victory
of a cat on a hot tin roof?

39:26.530 --> 39:28.115
I wish I knew.

39:28.199 --> 39:32.912
Just staying on it, I guess.

39:34.330 --> 39:35.706
That was fantastic.

39:39.502 --> 39:40.669
Brenda, you're up.

39:45.299 --> 39:47.093
{\an1}Same piece, please.
At your leisure.

39:51.430 --> 39:53.599
You were a wonderful lover.

39:55.684 --> 39:58.604
Such a wonderful person
to go to bed with.

40:01.232 --> 40:04.110
I think, mostly, because you
were really indifferent to it.

40:04.193 --> 40:06.278
Isn't that right?

40:06.362 --> 40:11.951
Never had any anxiety
about it...

40:12.034 --> 40:13.994
did it naturally...

40:14.078 --> 40:16.622
easily...

40:20.126 --> 40:23.754
Your indifference
made you wonderful...

40:26.757 --> 40:30.678
Um, I'm sorry, I think I...
left out a few lines.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.263
Could I start over?

40:43.774 --> 40:46.902
Bren! Bren, Bren, Bren,
Bren, Bren, Bren, Bren.

40:46.986 --> 40:48.362
Brandon, let me go.

40:48.445 --> 40:50.030
{\an1}I know what's going
through your head right now.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.157
Don't do this to yourself.

40:51.240 --> 40:52.491
Bran, this was my one chance

40:52.575 --> 40:54.201
to turn my life around
and I blew it.

40:54.285 --> 40:56.203
{\an3}Only a idiot would choose me
over any of the others.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.746
{\an1}Maybe Randolph will give you
a second chance, huh?

40:57.830 --> 40:59.623
Yeah, right.

41:01.250 --> 41:04.170
{\an6}Well, it's been
a rough 24 hours for
the Walsh kids, huh?

41:04.253 --> 41:06.672
You know, I really want to thank
you two for your help out here.

41:06.755 --> 41:08.674
Thank you very much, really.

41:08.757 --> 41:10.009
{\an1}STEVE: Come on,
this was definitely

41:10.092 --> 41:10.885
{\an1}a brother
and sister moment.

41:10.968 --> 41:14.346
{\an1}Brandon, I wouldn't have
known what to say.

41:14.430 --> 41:15.890
{\an3}KELLY:
Brandon.

41:15.973 --> 41:17.516
{\an1}Bran...

41:17.600 --> 41:18.559
Oh, man...

41:18.642 --> 41:19.560
{\an1}Hi, guys.

41:19.643 --> 41:21.770
Was that your sister?

41:21.854 --> 41:24.523
{\an1}She seemed
kind of tormented.

41:24.607 --> 41:25.733
Yeah, it runs in the family.

41:25.816 --> 41:27.109
How did you know I was here?

41:27.193 --> 41:29.945
Well, I went by your house.

41:30.029 --> 41:31.071
{\an1}Your mom and dad
told me.

41:31.155 --> 41:32.406
Clare.

41:32.489 --> 41:34.074
Do not go by my house.

41:34.158 --> 41:35.242
Do not call me.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.286
{\an1}Do not trick me
into going out with you.

41:37.369 --> 41:39.121
{\an1}Do not talk about me
with your father.

41:39.205 --> 41:41.916
{\an1}In fact, don't talk
to me at all.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.042
And if you do all
of these things,

41:43.125 --> 41:44.418
{\an1}you and I will
get along just fine.

41:44.501 --> 41:46.086
Do you understand that?

41:46.170 --> 41:47.171
{\an3}You know, I'd love
to stick around

41:47.254 --> 41:49.882
{\an3}and hear the rest of this,
but I gotta bail. Ciao.

41:51.884 --> 41:53.010
{\an3}So do I.

41:54.220 --> 41:57.389
{\an3}I know you didn't really
mean what you said.

42:07.191 --> 42:09.777
(doorbell rings)

42:16.700 --> 42:18.077
{\an3}I hope you're
glad to see me.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.870
{\an1}Of course I'm glad
to see you.

42:22.206 --> 42:24.166
{\an1}Look, I don't want to bring up
a sore subject,

42:24.250 --> 42:25.584
but how'd your audition go?

42:25.668 --> 42:26.669
It didn't.

42:26.752 --> 42:28.087
I dropped out.

42:28.170 --> 42:30.506
Kel, I hope that I didn't...

42:30.589 --> 42:33.676
It had nothing to do
with what you said.

42:33.759 --> 42:34.927
Really.

42:35.010 --> 42:36.804
I know it's
every little girl's dream

42:36.887 --> 42:38.305
to grow up and become a star,

42:38.389 --> 42:39.765
but it's not mine.

42:39.848 --> 42:40.849
I hate acting.

42:40.933 --> 42:44.478
And that is what I was trying
to tell you yesterday.

42:44.561 --> 42:45.813
Well, if I'd have known

42:45.896 --> 42:47.314
that that is what you were
trying to tell me,

42:47.398 --> 42:48.315
I would've listened.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.442
{\an3}Unfortunately,
the way it works

42:50.526 --> 42:52.319
is that you have
to listen first.

42:52.403 --> 42:53.654
I know that.

42:53.737 --> 42:54.863
I will.

42:54.947 --> 42:56.407
I'll try.

42:58.909 --> 43:00.077
So you think you can live

43:00.160 --> 43:02.538
with seeing Brenda's name in
lights, up all over the campus?

43:02.621 --> 43:03.664
Oh, I could've,

43:03.747 --> 43:06.000
{\an3}but she choked
at her audition.

43:06.083 --> 43:08.877
What? You're kidding me.
After all that?

43:08.961 --> 43:11.839
{\an1}She's not as strong
as she seems, is she?

43:11.922 --> 43:13.799
Well, it always amazes me

43:13.882 --> 43:15.676
how people think Brenda
is so strong.

43:15.759 --> 43:18.846
I mean, in reality,
she's pretty fragile.

43:18.929 --> 43:21.181
{\an3}I wouldn't worry about her
though; she's just like a cat,

43:21.265 --> 43:23.183
always lands on her feet.

43:34.111 --> 43:36.071
(rings doorbell)

43:44.246 --> 43:45.039
What can I do for you?

43:45.122 --> 43:47.916
{\an1}I know you don't believe
in second chances,

43:48.000 --> 43:52.129
but I want you to know that
I <i> can</i> play Maggie the Cat.

43:53.297 --> 43:56.175
{\an3}Okay. Show me
what you've got.
