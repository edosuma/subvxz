00:02.888 --> 00:05.632
Read the prepared statement
and then ask for questions.

00:05.672 --> 00:08.192
And expect Hanratty to ask
about the Wilkey Gardens bust.

00:08.232 --> 00:09.536
Reflect, but don't deny.

00:09.576 --> 00:11.332
Right. You got your notes?

00:11.400 --> 00:12.644
Don't need 'em.

00:12.712 --> 00:14.336
Thanks for making the trip.

00:14.376 --> 00:16.818
And now here's Captain David Aceveda.

00:17.832 --> 00:18.954
Thank you, Wanda.

00:19.592 --> 00:21.344
The Farmington district of Los Angeles…

00:21.384 --> 00:24.128
which I've been commanding
for the last four months…

00:24.168 --> 00:28.064
has traditionally been one of the most
dangerous, crime-ridden areas of the city.

00:28.104 --> 00:32.460
Some reporters have gone
so far as to label Farmington a war zone.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.505
Yeah, it's over at the corner!

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:51.880 --> 00:54.976
I'm proud to announce
that murders, rapes, armed robberies…

00:55.016 --> 00:58.144
and many other violent crimes
have decreased dramatically here…

00:58.184 --> 00:59.702
in the last six months.

01:03.848 --> 01:05.920
Under my direction,
law enforcement officers…

01:05.960 --> 01:09.260
now participate
in neighborhood outreach programs.

01:19.816 --> 01:22.272
Already, the effect
is being felt by local families.

01:22.312 --> 01:25.348
Mothers feel safer
as they shop for groceries.

01:29.896 --> 01:31.423
Too late, G-man.

01:32.744 --> 01:36.640
With the continued support of community
leaders and ordinary citizens…

01:36.680 --> 01:39.941
we can make the Farmington district
a safer home…

01:40.008 --> 01:41.022
for all of us.

01:42.632 --> 01:43.647
Mother…

01:45.864 --> 01:47.712
That's for running, asshole.

01:48.456 --> 01:49.601
Get up.

01:52.008 --> 01:53.666
What the hell, man?

01:55.648 --> 01:57.371
Look at that, Booty.

01:58.288 --> 02:01.160
Looks like you got
some kind of third nad going down there.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.589
Let me get that for ya.
No, wait!

02:03.664 --> 02:04.711
Shit!

02:05.744 --> 02:07.560
I got an evidence bag
somewhere.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.042
No, that's okay. I got it.
All right.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.280
Come on.

02:16.176 --> 02:17.518
Buenos dias.

02:18.704 --> 02:20.133
Any questions?

02:30.808 --> 02:31.888
Christ!

02:31.960 --> 02:34.192
You do not see a pair like that every day.

02:34.232 --> 02:35.508
It's called rigor.

02:35.575 --> 02:38.192
Rigor or no rigor, that's a serious rack.

02:38.232 --> 02:39.792
You wanna give 'em a squeeze?

02:39.832 --> 02:42.064
How much time we got
before the ME shows up?

02:42.104 --> 02:44.752
Victim's sister is outside.
Wants to know what happened.

02:44.792 --> 02:47.247
Dutch is in charge
of all potential criers.

02:47.287 --> 02:48.269
Thanks.

02:48.696 --> 02:49.968
Are you the first one here?

02:50.008 --> 02:51.599
Yeah. Me and Julien got the call.

02:51.639 --> 02:54.544
Last few weeks,
dead bodies seem to follow you around.

02:54.584 --> 02:56.591
Yeah, I'm a real fun-time gal.

02:56.664 --> 02:57.711
Any notions on this one?

02:57.751 --> 02:59.472
Nature of the wounds, we're looking at…

02:59.512 --> 03:01.232
an inexperienced under-achiever type.

03:01.272 --> 03:03.344
Covered genitals,
feels shame for what he did.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.776
Family member, boyfriend.
This one will break easy.

03:05.816 --> 03:07.921
Don't! Let me go!

03:07.992 --> 03:09.906
Goddamn it! Get outta my way!

03:09.944 --> 03:12.082
Miss, I need you to calm down.

03:12.151 --> 03:13.968
–Who are you?
–Detective Wagenbach.

03:14.008 --> 03:15.186
Is she dead?

03:15.256 --> 03:16.463
There's a young woman inside.

03:16.503 --> 03:17.744
We haven't identified her yet.

03:17.784 --> 03:19.248
This is my sister's place.

03:19.288 --> 03:21.232
Like I said, we don't know who she is yet.

03:21.272 --> 03:22.922
Long blonde hair, pretty.

03:24.023 --> 03:26.292
That sounds like her. I'm sorry.

03:35.447 --> 03:36.658
Ma'am.

03:40.503 --> 03:41.616
Ma'am.

03:45.848 --> 03:47.277
Where's Jenny?

03:47.991 --> 03:49.104
Jenny?

03:49.207 --> 03:51.451
Nancy's little girl. Where is she?

03:52.600 --> 03:53.974
Come with me.

04:01.592 --> 04:03.315
Guess what's missing?

04:06.392 --> 04:09.174
Shit, son.
I know.

04:09.432 --> 04:11.319
It just got interesting.

04:19.447 --> 04:20.855
Hey, Sarge.

04:21.976 --> 04:23.121
Thanks.

04:24.056 --> 04:27.488
I gotta hit the head.
I'll see you in the clubhouse.

04:28.856 --> 04:30.320
Hey, doll.
Just in time.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.592
I've got some reporters here.
You feel like talking?

04:32.632 --> 04:33.526
Nah.

04:33.592 --> 04:36.143
You sure? Gilroy and the chief
will push this story hard.

04:36.183 --> 04:38.352
Your team deserves a lot of credit.

04:38.392 --> 04:40.304
Let the poster boy do his thing.

04:40.344 --> 04:42.067
Talk to you.

04:43.415 --> 04:45.456
Peterson, the John's still not working?

04:45.496 --> 04:46.736
Plumber must have gotten lost.

04:46.776 --> 04:48.144
If this city wants to thank us…

04:48.184 --> 04:50.480
for a job well done,
how's about making sure…

04:50.520 --> 04:54.348
we don't all have to all cram
into the same goddamn stall?

04:57.592 --> 04:58.704
Vic, can I see you?

04:58.744 --> 05:00.724
Give me a sec.
I need you now.

05:00.791 --> 05:02.220
I'm taking a piss.

05:02.296 --> 05:04.591
Provided a spot
in the ladies' room opens up.

05:04.631 --> 05:06.289
I got my fingers crossed.

05:06.359 --> 05:07.374
Now.

05:11.351 --> 05:12.912
Aye, aye, Captain.

05:13.623 --> 05:14.736
Great.

05:15.095 --> 05:16.819
Have fun in here, bro.

05:17.848 --> 05:19.790
You remember Miguel Esteana.

05:20.024 --> 05:21.071
Sure.

05:21.528 --> 05:24.559
Miguel's a piece-of-shit drug dealer
with the 25th Street Coronas.

05:24.599 --> 05:27.504
This is the kind of attitude you foster
under your command?

05:27.544 --> 05:30.063
–Mr Esteana's attorney, José Garcia…
–I know José.

05:30.103 --> 05:32.368
He represents a bunch
of piece-of-shit drug dealers.

05:32.408 --> 05:35.119
What I do is ensure my clients' rights
aren't violated…

05:35.159 --> 05:36.347
by thugs like you.

05:36.408 --> 05:39.856
Mr Esteana claims
you used excessive force during his arrest.

05:39.896 --> 05:41.041
Really?

05:41.623 --> 05:43.762
Is that what you claim, Miguel?

05:44.888 --> 05:47.280
Yeah, that's some hickey.
Boyfriend give you that?

05:47.320 --> 05:50.190
No, you did it with some pliers.

05:50.871 --> 05:52.813
I don't recall any pliers.

05:53.432 --> 05:56.431
I remember the eight dime bags
of pure H we nabbed you with.

05:56.471 --> 05:59.248
The search, we'll be contesting
with Judge McAllister.

05:59.288 --> 06:03.024
I'm sorry. I'm drawing a blank
on this whole pliers thing.

06:03.064 --> 06:06.287
Feel free to ask my guys, but I doubt
they remember it that way either.

06:06.327 --> 06:08.176
You're a disgrace.
That's funny.

06:08.216 --> 06:12.836
I don't recall signing up for ethics class
from a scumbag drug lawyer.

06:13.559 --> 06:14.770
Is that all…

06:14.840 --> 06:16.782
or can I go take that piss?

06:17.943 --> 06:19.119
So Miguel is lying?

06:19.159 --> 06:20.528
Anything to stay out of jail.

06:20.568 --> 06:22.703
Fourth complaint since I came here.

06:22.743 --> 06:25.078
Lucky for me you don't believe 'em.

06:25.752 --> 06:27.666
Keep smiling for the cameras.

06:27.703 --> 06:31.333
See what you can do
about getting the men's John fixed.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.904
I stopped listening to you five minutes ago.

06:37.944 --> 06:39.983
I'm just saying our un-sub's disorganized…

06:40.023 --> 06:41.936
probably a record and no violent history.

06:41.976 --> 06:44.154
–“Un-sub”?
–Unidentified subject.

06:44.312 --> 06:45.719
You mean the killer.

06:46.039 --> 06:46.988
Yeah.

06:47.064 --> 06:49.006
Then just say that! Christ!

06:50.936 --> 06:52.656
You think Danny would go out with me?

06:52.696 --> 06:53.711
Danny?

06:54.264 --> 06:58.223
A study says over 40 percent of female
police meet their spouses on the job.

06:58.263 --> 06:59.984
You wanna date again, fine.

07:00.024 --> 07:02.127
But why chase after a uni-cop
in our own station?

07:02.167 --> 07:03.376
That's just lazy, son.

07:03.416 --> 07:05.648
Get her out of uniform,
I'll bet she's a knockout.

07:05.688 --> 07:07.056
Sign up for dance classes.

07:07.096 --> 07:09.274
Take out an ad. Join a book club.

07:09.335 --> 07:11.280
For God's sake, show some imagination.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.234
No wonder your wife left you.

07:13.304 --> 07:17.104
–Lucy had intimacy issues unrelated to me.
–Right, unrelated to you.

07:17.144 --> 07:19.533
Buzzer, Sarge!
Yeah!

07:19.608 --> 07:23.152
You're such an expert,
how come both your husbands left you?

07:23.192 --> 07:25.936
It sure as hell
wasn't for a lack of imagination.

07:25.976 --> 07:27.376
You got a missing kid?

07:27.416 --> 07:30.415
Jenny Reeborg, 8 years old.
We found her mother stabbed to death.

07:30.455 --> 07:31.383
Any leads?

07:31.448 --> 07:33.232
We're following some things up.

07:33.272 --> 07:34.922
What have you got so far?

07:35.096 --> 07:36.560
Her father's a crackhead.

07:36.600 --> 07:40.111
Personal nature of the crime, his daughter
missing, he's gonna be our guy.

07:40.151 --> 07:43.888
Also, a neighbor saw Ponyboy Harris
banging on the dead lady's door yesterday.

07:43.928 --> 07:44.944
Who's Ponyboy Harris?

07:44.984 --> 07:47.120
He's a local fence. Bit of a fancy.

07:47.160 --> 07:49.776
Collared him three or four times personally.

07:49.816 --> 07:52.528
You guys need anything run down, just ask.

07:52.568 --> 07:53.648
I wanna help.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.407
Thanks, Captain.

07:55.480 --> 07:58.054
Since when does he get his hands dirty?

07:58.584 --> 08:00.689
Can't blame a guy for trying.

08:02.296 --> 08:03.506
Danny, hey!

08:05.527 --> 08:06.956
How's the coffee?

08:07.512 --> 08:09.170
Usual police issue?

08:09.624 --> 08:12.341
Pretty much.
There's a shock.

08:13.911 --> 08:16.278
Listen, I don't…

08:16.344 --> 08:18.063
I don't know what your plans are…

08:18.103 --> 08:20.591
Lookie here, Shane, it's the ladykiller!

08:20.631 --> 08:21.936
Dutch boy, what's this I hear…

08:21.976 --> 08:24.912
about some dead girl's sister
blowing you at the crime scene?

08:24.952 --> 08:26.602
Dutch man! Going to town!

08:27.160 --> 08:29.331
You guys are sick.
Us?

08:29.400 --> 08:33.936
You're the one getting your pipe smoked
by a grieving relative right by the body.

08:33.976 --> 08:36.015
She was upset. I was comforting her.

08:36.056 --> 08:38.960
You don't have to tell me
about the different stages of grief.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.573
There's denial, anger, sucking you off.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.148
If you can think of anything else,
you just call 911 and ask for Det. Blow Me.

08:49.144 --> 08:51.991
Excuse me.
“Detective Blow Me.”

08:52.055 --> 08:54.864
Dutch, what?
Come on, don't be so sensitive.

08:54.904 --> 08:56.176
That was real classy.

08:56.216 --> 08:58.864
Come on. Dutch thinks he's
a notch above the rest of us.

08:58.904 --> 09:00.592
I'm bringing him back down to earth.

09:00.632 --> 09:02.225
That's big of you.

09:04.216 --> 09:06.288
I gotta go run an errand,
but I was thinking…

09:06.328 --> 09:08.048
you and I should get a drink tonight.

09:08.088 --> 09:09.408
Is your wife coming?

09:09.847 --> 09:12.752
Damn, she can't make it.
Damn, neither can I.

09:12.792 --> 09:14.772
Since when did you get morals?

09:15.288 --> 09:17.487
Always had them.
Sometimes I just lose track.

09:17.527 --> 09:18.673
Really?

09:19.416 --> 09:22.254
How's about you
lose track of them tonight?

09:23.064 --> 09:24.582
Yeah, I don't think so.

09:25.432 --> 09:27.016
You want me to back off?

09:27.479 --> 09:30.383
All you gotta do is tell me it wasn't great.

09:31.927 --> 09:33.204
You ready?

09:36.471 --> 09:37.519
Yeah.

10:08.568 --> 10:09.712
–Back to the barn.
–Who was that?

10:09.752 --> 10:10.798
–Back to the barn.
–Who was that?

10:10.838 --> 10:12.147
Guy I know.

10:36.310 --> 10:37.806
I went through the books.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.302
The guy I saw Mackey talking to
is a drug dealer named…

10:40.342 --> 10:42.000
Named Rondell Robinson.

10:42.070 --> 10:43.150
Right.

10:43.222 --> 10:45.102
You suggesting
Mackey's working for a dealer?

10:45.142 --> 10:47.022
I'm suggesting
he's working for Mackey.

10:47.062 --> 10:49.070
What?
Robinson's main competition…

10:49.110 --> 10:50.694
is a guy named Two-Time.

10:50.710 --> 10:52.558
Mackey's been taking out all his dealers…

10:52.598 --> 10:54.420
giving Robinson a monopoly.

10:54.486 --> 10:57.198
A monopoly means
profits go up for Robinson…

10:57.238 --> 10:59.502
street violence goes down for Mackey.

10:59.542 --> 11:01.876
And I want you to help me prove it.

11:08.150 --> 11:09.132
Okay.

11:14.198 --> 11:16.685
–Who's he?
–Moses Hernandez.

11:16.950 --> 11:18.350
We went to SC together.

11:18.390 --> 11:19.884
He's in Justice.

11:19.958 --> 11:21.714
Moses, this is Terry.

11:22.166 --> 11:23.182
It's good to meet you.

11:23.222 --> 11:25.454
I didn't agree to be a witness
in a federal case.

11:25.494 --> 11:28.494
The friends Mackey has,
federal's the only way we'll nail him.

11:28.534 --> 11:33.550
I go outside the department and rat out
another cop, my life's not worth crap in LA.

11:33.590 --> 11:34.834
He's right.

11:35.414 --> 11:36.590
It's too dangerous.

11:36.630 --> 11:37.838
He can't pull it off.

11:37.878 --> 11:39.198
I didn't say I that.

11:39.254 --> 11:40.236
I know.

11:40.310 --> 11:43.054
I just meant you need assurances
of an upside to all this.

11:43.094 --> 11:45.265
Such as?
Such as…

11:45.334 --> 11:48.206
a guarantee of a job in Justice
when it's all over.

11:48.246 --> 11:51.534
You think I want to be an errand boy
in some Alaskan outpost?

11:51.574 --> 11:53.092
You pick the city then.

11:53.782 --> 11:56.564
Okay. Try the home office in DC.

11:56.822 --> 11:58.990
I'm gonna need moving expenses.
Sure.

11:59.030 --> 12:01.747
Plus a car and a nice big fruit basket.

12:02.486 --> 12:04.942
I'm giving up my life,
you gotta give me something back.

12:04.982 --> 12:06.062
I can make it happen.

12:06.102 --> 12:08.366
Okay, no offense,
I'd like it in writing today.

12:08.406 --> 12:09.902
Let's be clear here, Terry.

12:09.942 --> 12:11.694
We're talking about making a case…

12:11.734 --> 12:14.254
that puts Mackey
behind bars for a long time.

12:14.294 --> 12:16.208
Because if we only wound him…

12:16.246 --> 12:18.542
his friends upstairs will crush both of us.

12:18.582 --> 12:20.238
Yeah, I know what I have to do.

12:20.278 --> 12:21.326
Good.

12:22.934 --> 12:25.310
I know what I'm getting out of this.

12:26.038 --> 12:28.078
What are you getting out of this?

12:28.118 --> 12:30.692
I just want a dirty cop off the street.

12:31.478 --> 12:37.088
You wanna be mayor someday, better learn
how to lie a hell of a lot better than that.

12:46.070 --> 12:47.052
Ponyboy!

12:47.478 --> 12:48.590
Goddamn!

12:48.662 --> 12:50.350
Claudette! Look what you made me do.

12:50.390 --> 12:51.758
What is all this stuff?

12:51.798 --> 12:56.022
That? That's just a big bunch of VCRs
I stole from Circuit City.

12:58.838 --> 13:00.430
I don't know anything about that girl.

13:00.470 --> 13:02.926
All right? Be real.
You know me. Come on.

13:02.966 --> 13:05.070
Why were you
at Nancy Reeborg's house yesterday?

13:05.110 --> 13:07.278
I was looking for her old man, Lonnie.

13:07.318 --> 13:09.102
Lonnie's not living there anymore.

13:09.142 --> 13:11.518
–I know that.
–You ever find Lonnie?

13:11.926 --> 13:13.444
You know Bunny Jenkins?

13:13.462 --> 13:16.750
Said he was using at this crack house
run by a guy named Monty.

13:16.790 --> 13:20.430
I was gonna go there after I unloaded
the VCRs, which is when you showed up.

13:20.470 --> 13:22.706
Okay. Good.
Good?

13:22.774 --> 13:25.646
Now let's work out
this Circuit City misunderstanding.

13:25.686 --> 13:26.864
Claudette?

13:34.038 --> 13:35.697
Vic?
Yeah, what?

13:35.766 --> 13:38.190
You know a crack house run
by some guy named Monty?

13:38.230 --> 13:41.422
Yeah, sure. It's on Crescent,
just west of 7th. Why?

13:41.462 --> 13:42.958
I gotta pick up a smokehound there.

13:42.998 --> 13:43.980
No, no can do.

13:44.054 --> 13:46.702
Monty gives me dirt,
I give him safe passage.

13:46.742 --> 13:50.570
This guy might have
something to do with the missing girl.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.422
All right, I'll go get him myself.

13:53.462 --> 13:55.534
The cards suck anyways.
Come on, Vic.

13:55.574 --> 13:56.696
No, I'm gonna go.

14:04.342 --> 14:05.520
Shut up!

14:08.214 --> 14:09.424
Vic.
Open.

14:11.926 --> 14:13.104
Shut up!

14:20.470 --> 14:21.998
Lonnie Reeborg. He here?

14:22.038 --> 14:24.678
–In there. Is there a problem?
–Show me.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.025
Okay, Lonnie. Let's go.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.070
Come on. Rise and shine.

14:33.110 --> 14:34.933
You stop that.
Let's go!

14:38.358 --> 14:39.765
What'd he do?

14:40.630 --> 14:43.150
You got kids here.
It's Teacher Institute Day.

14:43.190 --> 14:45.070
Where's their mom?
Buying supplies.

14:45.110 --> 14:47.886
Jesus Christ, Monty.
You can't have kids around this place.

14:47.926 --> 14:50.670
What am I supposed to do?
Stick them in a back room.

14:50.710 --> 14:53.230
–Rent The Lion King.
–Someone stole the TV.

14:53.270 --> 14:55.246
Then buy them some crayons
for Christ's sake!

14:55.286 --> 14:57.596
Just keep them away from this shit.

15:00.278 --> 15:01.969
Think back, Lonnie.

15:02.038 --> 15:04.150
You killed your wife last night.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.838
Why do you keep saying that?

15:05.878 --> 15:07.822
'Cause that's the God's truth, son.

15:07.862 --> 15:09.998
–You can't lie to God.
–Or the crime lab.

15:10.038 --> 15:11.790
Her blood's all over your shirt.

15:11.830 --> 15:13.739
I don't even got a shirt.

15:13.814 --> 15:15.091
It's evidence now.

15:15.382 --> 15:16.429
Where's Jenny?

15:16.726 --> 15:17.653
Jenny?

15:17.718 --> 15:19.182
Where is your daughter?

15:19.222 --> 15:20.718
I went there to pick her up.

15:20.758 --> 15:22.897
Where is she?
I needed her.

15:23.894 --> 15:26.228
You remember killing Nancy?

15:27.318 --> 15:29.141
You remember the knife?

15:29.270 --> 15:31.277
I just went there for Jenny.

15:32.630 --> 15:35.249
Think, Lonnie.
You went over there…

15:35.318 --> 15:37.739
I said that.
to get Jenny.

15:37.814 --> 15:40.629
She's half mine.
Nancy made you angry.

15:40.950 --> 15:42.286
She wouldn't let me take Jenny.

15:42.326 --> 15:45.262
You didn't mean to kill her,
she made you do it.

15:45.302 --> 15:46.960
I didn't kill no one.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.670
Think, Lonnie. What did you do to Nancy?

15:50.774 --> 15:52.017
I don't feel good.

15:52.086 --> 15:54.475
Concentrate!
What happened to Nancy?

15:54.550 --> 15:57.452
I don't…
You gotta keep trying.

15:57.718 --> 15:59.027
I'm trying.

16:02.198 --> 16:04.140
I went there to get Jenny.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.091
Yeah.

16:06.838 --> 16:08.661
Nancy tried to stop me.

16:10.262 --> 16:11.920
Keep going, Lonnie.

16:13.078 --> 16:14.671
She had a knife.

16:17.654 --> 16:18.930
What then?

16:21.142 --> 16:23.029
I took it away from her.

16:30.454 --> 16:31.763
What is it?

16:34.422 --> 16:36.081
What is it, Lonnie?

16:47.286 --> 16:48.693
I killed her.

16:49.942 --> 16:52.495
I killed my sweet Nancy!

16:56.374 --> 16:57.967
And where's Jenny?

16:58.294 --> 17:00.116
What did I do that for?

17:00.374 --> 17:02.032
'Cause you like crack?

17:02.230 --> 17:03.572
My daughter!

17:03.638 --> 17:05.838
I told you from the start this guy did it.

17:05.877 --> 17:07.438
Now where is she?

17:12.182 --> 17:13.491
I sold her.

17:18.998 --> 17:21.038
Sold her? You sold her to who?

17:21.109 --> 17:24.144
He gave me $200.

17:24.694 --> 17:27.060
Who did?
This guy.

17:28.438 --> 17:29.900
He likes girls.

17:30.742 --> 17:33.677
How come nobody stopped me?

17:38.038 --> 17:39.445
I don't know.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.317
Search warrant!

17:47.351 --> 17:48.341
Search warrant!

17:58.549 --> 18:00.075
George Sawyer.

18:01.888 --> 18:03.676
Where's Jenny Reeborg?

18:08.256 --> 18:09.663
“Sexy Schoolgirls.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.418
Jane at 15.”

18:11.488 --> 18:12.920
This is quite the reading list.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.204
Where's my mother?

18:14.272 --> 18:16.824
–It's time for her medication.
–I'll make a call.

18:16.864 --> 18:18.392
Make sure she gets her meds.

18:18.432 --> 18:20.920
If you wanna hold this pervert's hand,
be my guest.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.065
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

18:34.432 --> 18:35.708
Okay.

18:36.864 --> 18:38.489
Who took my Ding Dongs?

18:39.296 --> 18:40.504
Problem, Dutch Boy?

18:40.544 --> 18:42.424
I had some Ding Dongs. They're gone now.

18:42.464 --> 18:43.292
Ding Dongs?

18:43.359 --> 18:45.735
What are you, in kindergarten?
Look.

18:46.272 --> 18:48.471
I've got a suspect
whose profile screams:

18:48.511 --> 18:50.808
“Organized, humiliation-driven offender.”

18:50.848 --> 18:52.440
Which means he won't crack easy.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.256
Which means an interrogation
that will go on all night.

18:55.296 --> 18:57.367
Which means I need my Ding Dongs…

18:57.407 --> 18:58.935
and you took them. Didn't you?

18:58.975 --> 18:59.706
Right.

18:59.775 --> 19:03.575
'Cause I can't make it through the night
without one of your precious Ding Dongs.

19:03.615 --> 19:05.912
Stay away from me,
and stay away from my desk.

19:05.952 --> 19:07.577
We got an interview.

19:07.648 --> 19:09.368
What are you all riled up about?

19:09.408 --> 19:10.424
He took my Ding Dongs.

19:10.464 --> 19:13.398
Come on, son. Fork over his Ding Dongs.

19:17.663 --> 19:20.440
At my old squad,
people had respect for other people's…

19:20.480 --> 19:21.658
Forget it!

19:21.728 --> 19:24.376
How come everyone loves
this asshole so much?

19:24.416 --> 19:26.167
Let's go, we've got an interview.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.439
I think I saw some Twinkies
up in the break room.

19:28.479 --> 19:30.063
It's not the same thing.

19:33.216 --> 19:34.590
Here's your coffee.

19:34.656 --> 19:37.175
When you gonna call about
my mom's pills?

19:37.215 --> 19:38.742
In a minute.

19:39.008 --> 19:40.796
I got nothing to hide.

19:41.055 --> 19:42.200
I know.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.677
Tell me something.

19:48.160 --> 19:51.196
Think there's something wrong
with gay people?

19:51.775 --> 19:52.986
Something wrong?

19:53.056 --> 19:54.455
In the head, you know.

19:54.495 --> 19:57.752
With queers, I mean,
you think they got a screw loose?

19:57.792 --> 20:00.093
I don't know.
Not so long ago…

20:00.159 --> 20:02.424
medical community
classified homosexuality…

20:02.464 --> 20:03.609
as a disorder.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.066
Called it an illness.

20:05.440 --> 20:06.367
Yeah?

20:06.432 --> 20:09.463
Now scientists think maybe it's
some gene that makes people gay.

20:09.503 --> 20:10.485
So?

20:11.712 --> 20:13.239
For booking.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.735
So if God made 'em that way…

20:15.775 --> 20:19.640
who are we to say they're wrong
for doing the things they do?

20:19.680 --> 20:21.338
It got me thinking.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.096
What if scientists discovered…

20:23.136 --> 20:25.687
there's a gene
that predisposes some people…

20:25.727 --> 20:27.773
to be attracted to young girls?

20:28.576 --> 20:31.227
You think there is? In some people?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.461
Why not?

20:33.536 --> 20:37.148
And if scientists discover that gene, then…

20:38.176 --> 20:40.056
Then maybe people won't think…

20:40.096 --> 20:43.132
it's so wrong
to have sex with underage girls.

20:44.767 --> 20:46.044
Maybe not.

20:47.776 --> 20:50.284
Forgot to call about your mom's pills.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.940
How's the car running, Miguel?

21:08.864 --> 21:10.074
It's leaking oil.

21:10.144 --> 21:12.600
Yeah, these old cars
always need a lot of work.

21:12.640 --> 21:15.320
Must be a handy guy
with these tools laying around though.

21:15.360 --> 21:16.920
No pliers though.

21:16.992 --> 21:18.552
Miguel's not too fond of pliers.

21:18.592 --> 21:20.534
I can't say I blame him.

21:21.055 --> 21:22.903
Where's your lawyer, Miguel?

21:23.488 --> 21:25.081
I don't know.

21:35.104 --> 21:38.536
Miguel Esteana's dropping his complaint
against you.

21:39.232 --> 21:40.504
Told you it was bogus.

21:40.544 --> 21:43.576
I'd like your incident report
first thing tomorrow morning.

21:43.616 --> 21:47.864
Sure. It'll be a couple of days.
I got something on the back burner.

21:47.904 --> 21:49.562
It's not a request.

21:49.888 --> 21:51.448
Tomorrow morning.

21:51.840 --> 21:55.160
You'll get my report in a couple of days.
Maybe a week.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.720
You don't like the timetable,
you take it up with Gilroy.

21:57.760 --> 21:58.776
I don't have to.

21:58.816 --> 22:01.020
In this building, I'm in charge.

22:02.624 --> 22:04.631
Maybe in your own mind, amigo.

22:05.440 --> 22:07.480
But in the real world,
I don't answer to you.

22:07.520 --> 22:10.886
Not today, not tomorrow,
not even on Cinco de Mayo.

22:17.728 --> 22:18.807
You call for the police?

22:18.847 --> 22:20.631
Yeah, about two and a half hours ago.

22:20.671 --> 22:21.687
What's the problem?

22:21.727 --> 22:24.856
What you think the problem is?
Look at my goddamn tires!

22:24.896 --> 22:26.424
Someone slashed your tires?

22:26.464 --> 22:28.603
Was the real police busy today?

22:30.304 --> 22:33.934
–Any idea who might have done this?
–Lamar. He's my ex.

22:34.080 --> 22:37.016
I see he wasn't handling
his responsibilities as a man.

22:37.056 --> 22:40.252
I see that, I got no choice
but to step in.

22:41.344 --> 22:43.671
Did you witness
this Lamar slash your tires?

22:43.711 --> 22:45.752
Yeah, bro. I got the whole thing
on tape.

22:45.792 --> 22:47.801
Come on, man.
The brother dumb, but he ain't stupid.

22:47.841 --> 22:48.921
Are you gonna go arrest him?

22:48.961 --> 22:49.624
Are you gonna go arrest him?

22:49.664 --> 22:50.852
We'll talk to him.

22:50.912 --> 22:54.648
In the meantime, can you think of anyone
else who might have slashed your tires?

22:54.688 --> 22:55.833
Like who?

22:56.447 --> 22:58.302
Maybe a business associate?

22:58.624 --> 23:00.347
Business associate?

23:00.639 --> 23:02.680
What, you tryin' to imply something?

23:02.720 --> 23:04.574
Nah. I'm just wondering…

23:04.640 --> 23:07.869
why you got a $30·000 car
with $500 tires…

23:07.936 --> 23:10.774
parked outside of a
$400-a-month apartment.

23:26.016 --> 23:28.087
Give me the goddamn money for this…

23:28.127 --> 23:29.654
You, go to work.

23:31.328 --> 23:34.230
Dmitri. Heard you got paroled.

23:34.687 --> 23:36.536
I see you got your old job back.

23:36.576 --> 23:38.616
I'm just temping
for somebody who got the flu.

23:38.656 --> 23:40.063
Hand it over.

23:43.135 --> 23:44.597
Bankroll, too.

23:44.672 --> 23:48.434
Come on, Mackey, man.
That's just my playing-around coin.

23:50.016 --> 23:53.016
DMITRI: This ain't right.
Get lost.

23:53.087 --> 23:54.298
Yes, sir.

23:56.480 --> 23:58.199
What did I tell you last week?

23:58.239 --> 24:00.021
No more free passes, right?

24:00.352 --> 24:03.102
–I know.
–Let's go. Come on.

24:13.247 --> 24:15.222
Any news on Two-Time's party?

24:15.296 --> 24:17.804
It's definitely on
for Saturday night.

24:18.464 --> 24:19.511
Sure?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.822
'Cause I gotta be sure.

24:22.687 --> 24:24.411
He called up Ringo…

24:24.480 --> 24:27.978
and asked for his four best girls
for Saturday night.

24:30.336 --> 24:32.316
Guess I got left off the list.

24:32.384 --> 24:35.552
Look like you lost some weight.
You been eating?

24:36.383 --> 24:38.325
Sure, after business hours.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.864
I'll give you some money. Skip a couple
of tricks, get yourself some soup.

24:43.904 --> 24:45.560
I don't need your money, Vic.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.087
Here. You look thin. Get some soup.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.788
Don't worry about me, Vic.

24:54.367 --> 24:55.480
I get by.

24:56.224 --> 24:57.631
Where's your boy?

25:01.247 --> 25:02.524
With my mom.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.256
Yeah. Get him some soup, too.

25:15.424 --> 25:18.174
–You're sweet, Vic.
–Go see your son.

25:23.679 --> 25:26.811
I got a daughter. 14 next month.

25:28.479 --> 25:30.552
She's got a few friends,
like to come over…

25:30.592 --> 25:33.112
hang out, do homework,
that kind of thing.

25:33.152 --> 25:36.188
I don't know anything
about that missing girl.

25:36.704 --> 25:38.750
You know who Britney Spears is?

25:39.360 --> 25:40.767
I've seen videos.

25:40.832 --> 25:42.392
My daughter's got these friends…

25:42.432 --> 25:45.080
who like to dress up
like Britney Spears.

25:45.120 --> 25:47.967
Tight jeans, cutoff T-shirts.

25:50.496 --> 25:51.903
13 years old.

25:54.176 --> 25:56.085
She's got this one friend.

25:56.160 --> 25:57.338
Natalie.

25:58.656 --> 26:00.150
I'm telling you…

26:00.704 --> 26:02.936
I know I shouldn't be thinking
what I'm thinking…

26:02.976 --> 26:05.623
but the way this goddamn girl looks,
I mean…

26:05.663 --> 26:08.600
She may not be a woman yet,
but you can't call her a girl either.

26:08.640 --> 26:10.528
You know what I'm saying?

26:12.383 --> 26:13.910
Thirteen's a good age.

26:16.160 --> 26:18.429
Yeah, I bet it is.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.979
Can I get you some more coffee?

26:28.512 --> 26:30.360
I didn't know he had a daughter.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.222
He doesn't.

26:34.656 --> 26:36.440
What's your take on Vic Mackey?

26:36.480 --> 26:38.007
How do you mean?

26:38.144 --> 26:39.835
You know what I mean.

26:41.152 --> 26:42.581
I hear things.

26:43.007 --> 26:45.816
But as long as he's producing
on the street, he's got friends.

26:45.856 --> 26:47.644
Gilroy, even the chief.

26:47.712 --> 26:50.265
So he's bulletproof?
From you, yeah.

26:51.647 --> 26:53.848
I know what everybody here thinks.

26:53.888 --> 26:56.824
I'm a test taker.
I didn't earn it on the street.

26:56.864 --> 27:00.184
Came time to name a new captain,
I was the right color at the right time.

27:00.224 --> 27:02.775
You think taking on Mackey's
gonna change people's minds?

27:02.815 --> 27:04.376
I'm just talking.

27:05.695 --> 27:09.560
Right now, Vic Mackey must look like
a mighty big catch to you.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.771
Do the smart thing though, son.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.050
Cut bait.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.255
It doesn't bother you,
the things he does?

27:15.295 --> 27:17.944
–I don't judge other cops.
–Mackey's not a cop.

27:17.984 --> 27:19.512
He's Al Capone with a badge.

27:19.552 --> 27:22.552
Al Capone made money
by giving people what they wanted.

27:22.592 --> 27:24.312
What people want these days…

27:24.352 --> 27:27.512
is to make it to their class
without getting mugged.

27:27.552 --> 27:30.455
Come home from work,
see their stereo still there.

27:30.495 --> 27:32.312
Hear about some murder in the barrio…

27:32.352 --> 27:34.968
find out the next day
the police caught the guy.

27:35.008 --> 27:36.664
If having all that means some cop…

27:36.704 --> 27:38.808
roughs up some nigger or spic
in the ghetto…

27:38.848 --> 27:40.600
as far as most people are concerned…

27:40.640 --> 27:42.647
it's don't ask, don't tell.

27:44.704 --> 27:46.907
How you figure on changing that?

27:58.888 --> 28:00.481
Lamar Tilton?

28:00.808 --> 28:01.790
Yeah?

28:01.864 --> 28:04.928
We're investigating vandalism to a car
owned by your ex-girlfriend.

28:04.968 --> 28:06.882
You mean the tires I slashed?

28:07.433 --> 28:08.360
Yeah.

28:08.424 --> 28:09.792
You admit to vandalizing the car?

28:09.832 --> 28:10.781
Sure. Why not?

28:10.856 --> 28:12.480
How about 'cause the car isn't yours?

28:12.520 --> 28:15.869
I gave that skank $1·500
on her down payment.

28:16.808 --> 28:19.584
Day after she makes the delivery,
she kicks me out…

28:19.624 --> 28:23.265
then gives the car to this scrawny bitch
she's been balling on the side.

28:23.305 --> 28:26.469
–Your point being?
–My point being $1·500!

28:26.985 --> 28:28.032
Shit.

28:28.201 --> 28:30.945
The way I figure it,
that at least make the tires mine.

28:30.985 --> 28:33.632
Look, you tell that bitch
if she got a problem with that…

28:33.672 --> 28:35.363
she know where I am.

28:37.128 --> 28:39.136
Now this is all wrong, man.

28:40.073 --> 28:41.250
Jewelry.

28:41.832 --> 28:43.648
You see that new guy she's with?

28:43.688 --> 28:44.744
Yeah, I saw him.

28:44.808 --> 28:48.438
Then you know what kind of prick
I'm dealing with here.

28:48.873 --> 28:50.596
So where's the love?

28:50.664 --> 28:53.534
Bible. Galatians, chapter 7, verse 6.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.353
“For whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap.”

28:56.393 --> 28:58.901
You can stop with the sermon, Grandma.

28:59.177 --> 29:00.416
When I'm gettin' outta here?

29:00.456 --> 29:03.162
As soon as you arraign
and you post bail.

29:04.520 --> 29:05.664
You got anything else?

29:05.704 --> 29:07.231
How much bail gonna be?

29:07.592 --> 29:08.869
$200, $300.

29:08.968 --> 29:11.357
$200? I don't got that kind of cash.

29:13.640 --> 29:16.256
How were you able
to afford this jewelry then?

29:16.296 --> 29:18.672
I don't gotta explain myself to you.

29:19.689 --> 29:21.217
Lonnie knew I liked them young.

29:21.257 --> 29:23.489
He needed money.
Said I could do whatever I wanted…

29:23.529 --> 29:24.990
to his girl for $200.

29:25.064 --> 29:26.144
When he brought her by…

29:26.184 --> 29:28.641
it was obvious
she was like seven, eight years old.

29:28.681 --> 29:29.824
Was that a problem?

29:29.864 --> 29:31.904
I told Lonnie I like 'em 12 or 13.

29:31.944 --> 29:34.305
Like you were talking about,
developed a little.

29:34.345 --> 29:35.648
You must have been disappointed.

29:35.688 --> 29:39.103
Yeah, but Lonnie'd
already spent the money, so…

29:39.656 --> 29:41.664
Even though I didn't want her,
the girl was…

29:41.704 --> 29:43.008
you know, she was still mine.

29:43.048 --> 29:44.032
So you got rid of her?

29:44.072 --> 29:45.194
I don't hurt 'em.

29:45.544 --> 29:48.414
I like 'em to like me. Romantic-like.

29:48.489 --> 29:50.881
Things just didn't work out this time.

29:50.921 --> 29:52.256
What'd you do with her?

29:52.296 --> 29:53.540
I traded her.

29:54.249 --> 29:55.328
You traded her?

29:55.400 --> 29:56.928
To a doctor I met on the Internet.

29:56.968 --> 29:58.240
He likes them 7 or 8.

29:58.280 --> 30:00.481
He came right over and picked her up.

30:00.521 --> 30:01.797
You traded her?

30:02.120 --> 30:03.549
I was out $200.

30:03.753 --> 30:05.793
What'd this doctor trade you?

30:05.865 --> 30:07.774
A girl to be named later.

30:08.264 --> 30:11.564
You know,
like the kind of trades ball teams make.

30:11.816 --> 30:12.929
Right.

30:20.808 --> 30:23.175
That's a nice boat.
Thanks.

30:23.240 --> 30:25.472
I take the kids
up to Lake Powell every year.

30:25.512 --> 30:26.912
You know, fishing and swimming.

30:26.952 --> 30:29.312
–Sounds great.
–Two weeks' vacation doesn't make up…

30:29.352 --> 30:30.656
for a year of double shifts…

30:30.696 --> 30:32.544
but the kids really look forward to it.

30:32.584 --> 30:33.574
How's the meat?

30:33.640 --> 30:35.585
Five more minutes,
you can bring out the buns.

30:35.625 --> 30:36.607
Great.

30:36.680 --> 30:39.233
Did you tell Matthew
he could keep a spider in his room?

30:39.273 --> 30:40.641
That's for a school project.

30:40.681 --> 30:42.721
If that thing gets loose…
It won't.

30:42.761 --> 30:44.081
Yeah, it better not.

30:44.104 --> 30:46.439
It won't.
Better not.

30:50.088 --> 30:52.794
What did I tell you
about jumping in the…

30:54.121 --> 30:55.639
They grow up too quick.

30:55.945 --> 30:58.083
Especially with the job we got.

30:58.280 --> 31:01.216
Yeah, what you're doing though,
has to be done.

31:01.256 --> 31:02.685
You think?

31:02.792 --> 31:04.101
Absolutely.

31:04.744 --> 31:07.328
My dad was a cop.
He admired guys like you.

31:07.368 --> 31:10.368
Those were some
honest-to-goodness men back then.

31:10.408 --> 31:13.790
Guys like Captain Aceveda,
they never understand.

31:14.504 --> 31:17.276
What do you expect
from a damn quota baby?

31:19.976 --> 31:22.625
I think I could be a lot
more useful to you.

31:22.665 --> 31:24.909
You know, do more than just drive.

31:24.968 --> 31:25.983
Yeah?

31:26.057 --> 31:28.480
Yeah. I know why you've been reluctant
to include me.

31:28.520 --> 31:32.064
You got a team. You watch out for
each other, know how the others will move.

31:32.104 --> 31:34.282
You'd kill to protect each other.

31:34.408 --> 31:36.577
It's all about trust,
otherwise, you end up dead.

31:36.617 --> 31:37.664
Yeah.

31:39.112 --> 31:40.574
Listen.

31:40.648 --> 31:43.328
Up till now,
Two-Time's has been impossible to nail.

31:43.368 --> 31:45.376
Never keeps drugs at his place
until tonight.

31:45.416 --> 31:47.008
Yeah, what's so special about tonight?

31:47.048 --> 31:48.992
He's gearing up for a big bash
tomorrow night.

31:49.032 --> 31:51.744
He's got a bunch of coke
he's handing out as party favors.

31:51.784 --> 31:53.792
Our one chance to nail him with the goods.

31:53.832 --> 31:56.221
–Lock and load, baby.
–Yeah!

31:56.648 --> 31:58.816
This is not gonna be
any beauty pageant, ladies.

31:58.856 --> 32:00.192
He's got steel-enforced doors…

32:00.232 --> 32:03.264
so we go through a window
and be fast before he starts flushing.

32:03.304 --> 32:04.608
Knock, knock, who's there?

32:04.648 --> 32:07.624
Strike Team, Mr Drug Dealer.

32:07.944 --> 32:10.976
And on top of that,
Terry here is losing his cherry tonight.

32:11.016 --> 32:13.760
He's coming with us.
Terry is losing his cherry.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.003
Welcome aboard. Congratulations.

32:17.512 --> 32:20.000
Remember, the team comes first.

32:20.072 --> 32:22.464
We take care of each other, all right?

32:22.504 --> 32:24.773
–Cheers.
–Cheers.

32:27.528 --> 32:29.600
We just have a few more questions.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.550
–Dr Grady.
–Right, Dr Grady.

32:31.624 --> 32:33.184
And I have a practice to attend to…

32:33.224 --> 32:36.320
patients to see, so charge me
with something or release me.

32:36.360 --> 32:37.951
Do you know who Jenny Reeborg is?

32:37.991 --> 32:39.360
DR. No.
George Sawyer says…

32:39.400 --> 32:42.432
he gave Jenny to you
for the purpose of sexual intercourse.

32:42.472 --> 32:44.479
I don't even know the man.

32:45.384 --> 32:46.847
You tell us where Jenny is…

32:46.887 --> 32:48.992
we'll get the DA to make a favorable offer.

32:49.032 --> 32:50.821
Charge me or release me.

32:51.240 --> 32:53.149
We'll see what we can do.

32:54.664 --> 32:55.908
Tell me something.

32:55.976 --> 32:58.336
As a man of science, I'd like your opinion.

32:58.376 --> 33:01.310
Is homosexuality genetic or environment?

33:01.384 --> 33:03.136
The latest studies suggest it's genetic.

33:03.176 --> 33:05.478
Really? Just the way they are?

33:05.544 --> 33:07.072
Can't help themselves, huh?

33:07.112 --> 33:09.422
I see where you're going with this.

33:09.448 --> 33:11.041
Don't waste my time.

33:11.560 --> 33:12.770
Or yours.

33:14.024 --> 33:15.911
I've got plenty of time.

33:16.999 --> 33:18.374
I'm bored.

33:18.632 --> 33:20.454
Charge me or release me.

33:22.888 --> 33:25.696
This guy is definitely
a domination-control pedophile.

33:25.736 --> 33:27.167
Is he capable of killing her?

33:27.207 --> 33:28.451
Fits the profile.

33:28.519 --> 33:31.104
–Let him sit for a couple hours, try again.
–Couple hours?

33:31.144 --> 33:34.239
Girl's missing since yesterday morning.
Has she got food or water?

33:34.279 --> 33:36.704
–I can break him by the end of the day.
–Take all week.

33:36.744 --> 33:38.400
There's no way this pecker's gonna talk.

33:38.440 --> 33:40.576
I know what buttons to push
with this guy.

33:40.616 --> 33:41.824
I'm smarter than he is.

33:41.864 --> 33:44.128
This is not a quiz show, Dutch.
Lose the ego.

33:44.168 --> 33:45.472
Think about Jenny Reeborg.

33:45.512 --> 33:47.690
I am. You got a better plan?
Yes.

33:47.752 --> 33:48.734
Let him go.

33:48.808 --> 33:50.112
–Let him go?
–We tail him.

33:50.152 --> 33:53.184
If we lose him, first thing he'll do is
kill her, dump the body.

33:53.224 --> 33:54.592
Look, I can break this guy.

33:54.632 --> 33:56.224
Your way will get her killed.

33:56.264 --> 33:57.693
So will yours!

34:01.096 --> 34:02.340
Anywhere in here.

34:02.600 --> 34:05.022
What about attack dogs? I hate dogs.

34:06.056 --> 34:07.365
I need you.

34:21.096 --> 34:22.623
And who are you?

34:24.424 --> 34:25.699
DR. Who is he?

34:31.400 --> 34:33.539
You know what you're doing, son?

34:38.951 --> 34:40.543
What's in the bag?

34:53.096 --> 34:54.812
DR. What's that stuff for?

34:55.400 --> 34:59.904
That's what I'm gonna use to get you
to tell me where Jenny Reeborg is.

34:59.944 --> 35:01.660
Your turn to play bad cop?

35:01.672 --> 35:05.152
No. Good cop and bad cop left for the day.

35:06.664 --> 35:08.671
I'm a different kind of cop.

35:12.264 --> 35:14.112
I'm ready to see my lawyer now.

35:14.152 --> 35:15.362
Later.

35:16.039 --> 35:18.625
Right now it's just you and me.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.542
People are watching us.

35:24.327 --> 35:26.144
I got a little girl back at home.

35:26.184 --> 35:29.315
8-year-old daughter. Her name is Cassidy.

35:30.056 --> 35:31.648
What do you say I bring her down here?

35:31.688 --> 35:33.664
Let you stick your dick in her.

35:33.704 --> 35:35.024
How'd you like that?

35:35.400 --> 35:37.342
–What?
–You know.

35:37.992 --> 35:40.170
Suck her tits a little bit maybe?

35:41.064 --> 35:42.471
Not interested.

35:43.208 --> 35:46.528
So you want to have some other guy's
little girl, but not my Cassidy?

35:46.568 --> 35:48.064
What's up with that, man?

35:48.104 --> 35:51.232
I'd like to take a look
at this Jenny for myself.

35:51.272 --> 35:54.110
See what she's got
that my Cassidy doesn't.

35:54.536 --> 35:56.648
I'm sure you could arrange that.

35:56.936 --> 35:58.560
I don't know where the girl is.

35:58.600 --> 36:00.316
Her name is Jenny Reeborg.

36:00.680 --> 36:03.808
I'm giving you one chance
to let me know where you're hiding her.

36:03.848 --> 36:05.790
I'm sorry. I wish I could…

36:15.432 --> 36:16.992
DR. You're the police!

36:46.368 --> 36:48.663
He's got a basement apartment
under a fake name.

36:48.703 --> 36:49.912
Jenny's there alone.

36:49.952 --> 36:52.196
Last he knew, she was still alive.

36:55.968 --> 36:58.344
You got something to say, Dutch boy?

36:59.200 --> 37:01.510
Like, “Thanks for solving my case”?

37:02.911 --> 37:04.700
Just glad I could help!

37:40.351 --> 37:41.944
Jenny?

37:47.552 --> 37:49.242
Watch out.

37:51.199 --> 37:54.068
Come on, goddamn it. Come on!

38:06.975 --> 38:08.404
It's okay, baby.

38:09.055 --> 38:10.004
Jenny.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.283
Jenny, you're safe now, sweetie.

38:12.639 --> 38:14.166
You're safe now.

38:19.615 --> 38:22.387
No way, man. I ain't got to listen to you.

38:24.095 --> 38:25.175
Dutch.

38:25.823 --> 38:27.224
Heard you found your missing girl.

38:27.264 --> 38:31.224
Yeah, guy turned out to be
a domination-control sociopath.

38:31.295 --> 38:33.565
Had her locked in this cage thing.

38:33.919 --> 38:35.160
Good thing you took him out.

38:35.200 --> 38:36.094
Yeah.

38:36.447 --> 38:38.357
So what are you doing here?

38:38.432 --> 38:40.056
Your shift was over this morning.

38:40.096 --> 38:41.622
As I… Right?

38:41.920 --> 38:45.143
Wickman and Greenwalt called in sick
and me and Julien worked a double.

38:45.183 --> 38:46.198
I hate doubles.

38:46.271 --> 38:47.640
I'm on my way home now.

38:47.680 --> 38:50.298
Listen, I was gonna grab a beer…

38:50.367 --> 38:53.015
with some of my old buddies
from Sunset in case…

38:53.055 --> 38:55.191
you wanna tag along?
–That'd be great.

38:55.231 --> 38:58.046
–Great.
–But I'm not free…

38:58.111 --> 38:58.972
tonight.

38:59.040 --> 39:01.975
I mean, my friend Betsy set me up
on this blind date.

39:02.015 --> 39:03.863
It's probably gonna be a nightmare and…

39:03.903 --> 39:05.725
No, it sounds like fun.

39:06.047 --> 39:07.448
So some other time, okay?

39:07.488 --> 39:09.816
I'd love to go out
with you and the guys and stuff…

39:09.856 --> 39:11.832
and hear some of the old stories.

39:11.872 --> 39:14.206
–What's that smell?
–What?

39:14.271 --> 39:15.962
You don't smell that?

39:16.511 --> 39:17.940
Oh, man. Yeah.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.309
What is that?

39:25.695 --> 39:28.445
It's dog shit. Jesus Christ.

39:28.511 --> 39:32.273
All right. Whoever did this
better clean it up right now.

39:33.663 --> 39:37.719
It's you, isn't it? You clean this up,
or I'm gonna shove it down your throat.

39:37.759 --> 39:39.581
You got the wrong guy.

39:39.647 --> 39:41.559
I promise you, I am not gonna rest…

39:41.599 --> 39:43.543
until the culprit is brought to justice.

39:43.583 --> 39:45.241
Attention, everyone.

39:45.311 --> 39:47.416
I'm declaring this an official crime scene.

39:47.456 --> 39:50.888
Nobody leaves here
without providing a stool sample.

39:51.871 --> 39:54.205
Who gets to bag the evidence?

39:59.583 --> 40:02.103
Some prank.
Yeah.

40:03.391 --> 40:06.552
You know,
I once heard about this old cop tradition.

40:06.592 --> 40:10.007
Anytime someone in the squad
started getting a big head…

40:10.047 --> 40:13.047
some other cop
would put dog crap in his locker.

40:13.087 --> 40:14.265
Or desk.

40:15.263 --> 40:17.303
Remind him he's just one guy.

40:17.535 --> 40:19.095
Part of the team.

40:20.735 --> 40:22.645
You heard about that?

42:27.528 --> 42:28.837
TWO-Give me that.

42:30.823 --> 42:31.968
Get up.

08:37:49.835 --> 08:37:50.794
