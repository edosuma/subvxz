WEBVTT

00:04.862 --> 00:06.241
You got a few minutes?

00:07.655 --> 00:09.034
What's up?

00:09.068 --> 00:11.310
Well, my biggest
thing is,

00:11.344 --> 00:12.965
you know, we're getting
pretty late into this trip.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.172
We've seen some
pretty good stuff, but, uh,

00:15.206 --> 00:16.620
we haven't jumped
on anything yet.

00:16.655 --> 00:18.689
And it's, uh, got me
kinda worried.

00:18.724 --> 00:20.931
Your season's coming
pretty fast.

00:20.965 --> 00:22.827
Listen, the thing is, man,

00:22.862 --> 00:26.655
the reality is, you still
haven't actually chosen what
type of plant you want.

00:26.689 --> 00:29.724
We should probably
be at that stage by now.

00:29.758 --> 00:32.068
If I knew which one I want,
we wouldn't
be in the country.

00:32.793 --> 00:34.172
That's why we're on this trip.

00:34.206 --> 00:35.689
Oh, I know it is, but...

00:36.655 --> 00:38.379
...we're quite a long way
into it.

00:38.413 --> 00:41.206
Surely, like, if you can make
that decision,

00:41.241 --> 00:43.620
then we can move on
to the next step

00:43.655 --> 00:45.862
and, like, get the ball
rolling, right?

00:47.034 --> 00:48.137
I'm leaving.

00:49.517 --> 00:52.034
Don't tell me what
to do, Danny.

01:09.758 --> 01:12.482
This is the most time
I've ever spent anywhere
that was, like,

01:12.517 --> 01:14.896
next to the open ocean.

01:14.931 --> 01:18.275
Yeah, Alaska's all, like,
inner coast, you know, like,

01:18.310 --> 01:19.482
inlets and fjords.

01:21.344 --> 01:23.482
<i>Nine years ago,</i> <i>
Parker Schnabel</i>

01:23.517 --> 01:25.655
<i>left his grandpa's claim</i> <i>
in Alaska</i>

01:25.689 --> 01:28.379
<i>to find big gold in the Yukon.</i>

01:28.413 --> 01:30.689
3,362.

01:30.724 --> 01:33.482
Good job, buddy.

01:33.517 --> 01:37.620
<i>Now, after mining</i> <i>
over $70 million in gold,</i>

01:37.655 --> 01:40.344
<i>he's betting his fortune</i> <i>
and reputation</i>

01:40.379 --> 01:43.586
<i>on a new venture back home</i> <i>
in Alaska.</i>

01:43.620 --> 01:45.241
It's a weird point where...

01:46.655 --> 01:48.655
you have to decide to quit
while you're ahead,

01:48.689 --> 01:51.689
<i>or do you double down</i> <i>
and get lean and mean?</i>

01:52.724 --> 01:54.758
<i>And that starts</i> <i>
with a wash plant.</i>

01:54.793 --> 01:56.689
<i>You know, wash plant's</i> <i>
the heart of your operation.</i>

01:57.896 --> 02:00.206
Are we gonna go visit our
favorite South African today?

02:00.241 --> 02:02.793
You know shaker decks
inside out, so why do you
wanna see this one?

02:02.827 --> 02:05.793
I'd like to cut... talk myself
out of a trommel if I could,

02:05.827 --> 02:09.689
because they're
more complicated than
a screen deck is.

02:09.724 --> 02:13.862
<i>After four weeks</i> <i>
searching for the perfect</i> <i>
plant in New Zealand,</i>

02:13.896 --> 02:16.586
<i>Parker still hasn't pulled</i> <i>
the trigger.</i>

02:16.620 --> 02:19.793
Fairbanks is gonna be full
of a whole lot of surprises,

02:19.827 --> 02:23.241
lots of clay, lots of very
difficult-to-recover gold.

02:23.275 --> 02:25.793
<i>And, you know, to buy</i> <i>
the wash plant</i>

02:25.827 --> 02:27.310
<i>that can deal</i> <i>
with all of that,</i>

02:27.344 --> 02:30.689
be... hype production,
and be portable...

02:32.724 --> 02:35.655
...you know,
it's a huge challenge.

02:35.689 --> 02:39.241
<i>So far,</i> <i>
Parker has looked exclusively</i> <i>
at trommels,</i>

02:39.275 --> 02:43.172
<i>known for their ability</i> <i>
to handle clay-laden ground.</i>

02:43.206 --> 02:46.344
This sets a very high standard
for what we're looking for.

02:47.344 --> 02:48.827
<i>But...</i>

02:48.862 --> 02:51.586
- Oh, You've got two more plants running here.
- Yeah.

02:51.620 --> 02:55.551
<i>...after spotting</i> <i>
a shaker deck at miner</i> <i>
Louis Nel's,</i>

02:55.586 --> 02:57.344
<i>Parker is wavering.</i>

02:59.068 --> 03:02.137
I think we should come back.
I'd like to see a screen deck.

03:03.793 --> 03:05.724
You and I both know screens
inside and out.

03:07.068 --> 03:09.068
Parker really likes
shaker decks.

03:09.103 --> 03:12.344
But, if he starts to sort
of change his mind

03:12.379 --> 03:15.103
about the way he wants
to mine Alaska now,

03:15.137 --> 03:17.793
it will be quite a big U-turn.

03:17.827 --> 03:20.758
And that could have
ramifications down the line.

03:25.655 --> 03:27.931
<i>The team</i> <i>
are returning to Louis Nel's</i>

03:27.965 --> 03:31.379
<i>gold-rich, 500-acre claim</i> <i>
near Ruatapu.</i>

03:32.551 --> 03:34.793
All right.
Let's go find Louis.

03:38.172 --> 03:40.137
You guys see
what I'm saying?

03:40.172 --> 03:42.758
Yeah, yeah.

03:44.103 --> 03:45.482
- Yes.
- Good.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.275
I know, we just
couldn't resist coming back
and checking out

03:47.310 --> 03:49.137
- some of your other wash plants.
- Oh?

03:49.172 --> 03:51.448
You got so many of them running around here.

03:56.103 --> 03:58.689
<i>Kiwi miners favor</i> <i>
trommels to process</i>

03:58.724 --> 04:01.827
<i>the country's clay-ridden pay.</i>

04:01.862 --> 04:05.517
<i>Louis is the only miner</i> <i>
they've met who uses</i> <i>
a shaker deck.</i>

04:16.344 --> 04:18.965
Our screen decks
in the Yukon have gotten
pretty, like, specialized

04:19.000 --> 04:22.206
and they're all very similar,
and I wanna see if you've
done anything different.

04:22.241 --> 04:25.862
Mind if I hop up there and check it out?

04:25.896 --> 04:28.517
<i>Shaker decks</i> <i>
are renowned</i> <i>
for their durability</i>

04:28.551 --> 04:30.241
<i>and compact design.</i>

04:30.275 --> 04:32.965
<i>Spray bars mounted</i> <i>
on the vibrating decks</i>

04:33.000 --> 04:35.206
<i>wash the gold from the rocks,</i>

04:35.241 --> 04:38.068
<i>which is then sorted through</i> <i>
a series of screens.</i>

04:39.137 --> 04:42.000
<i>Shakers often struggle</i> <i>
to wash sticky clay.</i>

04:43.103 --> 04:45.310
<i>And tailings can be expelled</i>

04:45.344 --> 04:47.482
<i>before all the gold</i> <i>
has been recovered.</i>

04:53.206 --> 04:54.241
Right.

04:58.137 --> 05:00.793
Well, there's no way
to see them run like
running them yourself.

05:00.827 --> 05:02.379
Do you mind if I hop in there?

05:06.620 --> 05:09.413
It sounds like they probably
use this for mostly, for like,

05:09.448 --> 05:11.758
material that's pretty easy
to wash.

05:11.793 --> 05:14.827
- Cleaner material.
- Yeah, but once I get in the hoe here,

05:14.862 --> 05:17.517
I've gotta run and get in,
but ask him about

05:17.551 --> 05:18.965
if they'll send a couple loads

05:19.000 --> 05:20.965
- of the dirtier clay stuff.
- See what it does?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.689
Yeah. He might not want to,
but ask him.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.000
Yeah. No, I'll ask him
for sure.

05:32.068 --> 05:35.000
I know Parker's got
some ground, you know,

05:35.034 --> 05:36.655
<i>in Alaska and it's got</i> <i>
clay in it,</i>

05:36.689 --> 05:39.379
<i>and I was curious if maybe</i> <i>
we can run some ground</i> <i>
through here</i>

05:39.413 --> 05:40.793
<i>- with a bit of clay in it.</i>
- <i>Yep.</i>

05:40.827 --> 05:43.206
Perfect, well, we'll let
him run this and we'll go
grab some.

05:43.965 --> 05:44.931
Yeah.

05:48.275 --> 05:51.482
If you're on ground that's
difficult to wash,

05:51.517 --> 05:54.206
then everybody's gonna say,
"Get a trommel".

05:54.241 --> 05:56.758
<i>But, screen decks</i> <i>
are what we know.</i>

05:56.793 --> 05:59.896
A lot of our parts
would be... interchangeable,

05:59.931 --> 06:03.793
but ultimately gold recovery
has to overshadow
those things.

06:03.827 --> 06:05.689
<i>You know,</i> <i>
the ground in Fairbanks,</i>

06:05.724 --> 06:07.896
there is one spot where
we hit this, like,

06:07.931 --> 06:10.551
<i>kind of a false bedrock layer</i> <i>
with quite a bit of gold</i> <i>
in it.</i>

06:10.586 --> 06:14.275
And that was, like,
really sticky, nasty clay.

06:14.310 --> 06:19.000
And recovery with a screen
deck is gonna suffer.

06:19.034 --> 06:20.931
You know, you get a lot more
bang for your buck

06:20.965 --> 06:23.827
<i>in terms of yards an hour</i> <i>
our of a screen cage,</i> <i>
too, like,</i>

06:23.862 --> 06:27.551
the equivalent size screen
versus a trommel,

06:27.586 --> 06:29.551
is a huge factor difference.

06:33.034 --> 06:35.068
So, this material
down here

06:35.103 --> 06:37.137
is the closest I think
we're gonna get

06:37.172 --> 06:39.172
- to the ground of Parker's up in Alaska.
- Yeah.

06:39.206 --> 06:41.793
<i>Can we take some</i> <i>
of this and run it through</i> <i>
the shaker?</i>

06:42.655 --> 06:43.655
Perfect.

06:46.827 --> 06:49.965
<i>Oh, yeah. Perfect.</i> <i>
There's the good stuff.</i>

06:52.655 --> 06:53.862
<i>Right on.</i>

06:55.724 --> 06:57.103
<i>Hey, uh, Parker.</i>

06:57.137 --> 07:00.344
<i>Um, I've got some, uh,</i> <i>
ground from the, uh,</i> <i>
bottom pit there.</i>

07:00.379 --> 07:02.310
Do you wanna start running
that through now,

07:02.344 --> 07:04.206
we'll start doing
a bit of, uh, tests,
see how it does?

07:04.241 --> 07:05.413
Copy that.

07:07.413 --> 07:09.793
<i>Parker has just</i> <i>
three weeks left</i>

07:09.827 --> 07:12.241
<i>to find the perfect plant</i> <i>
and ship it home</i>

07:12.275 --> 07:16.206
<i>in time for the start</i> <i>
of Alaska's mining season.</i>

07:16.241 --> 07:18.068
<i>Starting to feel</i> <i>
a little bit of pressure,</i>

07:18.103 --> 07:20.034
<i>so is Jeff, so is Danny.</i>

07:20.068 --> 07:21.241
We don't have time to waste.

07:21.275 --> 07:24.344
<i>If Parker wants to start</i> <i>
mining in Alaska this year,</i>

07:24.379 --> 07:26.827
he has to start making
some big decisions and ASAP,

07:26.862 --> 07:28.068
and he's just not doing that.

07:28.103 --> 07:29.724
I'm just hoping that
after today,

07:29.758 --> 07:33.068
we can at least narrow it down
in some way or another.

07:33.103 --> 07:36.965
<i>This place</i> <i>
is the best opportunity</i> <i>
to make some decisions</i>

07:37.000 --> 07:38.620
<i>about what the wash plant is.</i>

07:38.655 --> 07:41.379
So if we can't, then I think
we've got problems.

07:43.827 --> 07:44.965
Or Parker has problems.

07:50.862 --> 07:52.689
Danny! Danny,
come look at this.

07:52.724 --> 07:54.344
- Come here!
- What is it?

07:55.586 --> 07:58.655
- Gold?
- No, look at it.

08:02.793 --> 08:04.482
- Oh, wow.
- How stunning is that?

08:04.517 --> 08:05.758
That's quite
a lump, huh?

08:05.793 --> 08:07.620
- Yeah.
- It's huge.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.137
What's the deal
with that? Is that a little,

08:09.172 --> 08:11.413
- a little bobby bonus, Louis?
- No.

08:16.655 --> 08:18.517
Oh, wow.
Does it mean a lot to them?

08:22.206 --> 08:23.482
- Oh, gotcha.
- Yeah.

08:23.517 --> 08:25.172
So are you taking it
back to him now,
is that what the...

08:29.000 --> 08:29.931
Yeah.

08:32.482 --> 08:33.620
I can take it
if you want.

08:34.655 --> 08:35.931
You're busy with the...
I can do it.

08:38.379 --> 08:40.172
- Yay. Dan, you wanna come?
- Yeah.

08:40.206 --> 08:41.517
- Nice.
- Go ahead, grab it.

08:41.551 --> 08:42.724
How heavy is it?

08:49.551 --> 08:53.724
- Don't drop that. Is it heavy?
- heavy.

08:53.758 --> 08:56.000
Are they gonna be,
like, super pleased
to see this, Louis?

08:58.241 --> 08:59.482
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

08:59.517 --> 09:01.034
Is that worth,
is that worth a few quid?

09:02.034 --> 09:03.310
Like, thousands?

09:05.724 --> 09:06.689
Yeah, okay.

09:08.379 --> 09:10.344
- All right.
- Let's do it.

09:10.379 --> 09:11.482
Hit the road.

09:11.517 --> 09:14.413
I'm excited.
What a nice little adventure.

09:14.448 --> 09:16.620
<i>Sacred to the Maori people,</i>

09:16.655 --> 09:19.655
<i>the green stone gives</i> <i>

<i>Te Waipounamu,</i> <i>

09:24.413 --> 09:25.655
<i>In 1997,</i>

09:25.689 --> 09:29.000
<i>the government decreed</i> <i>
it was owned by the Maori</i>

09:29.034 --> 09:31.827
<i>and any found must</i> <i>
be returned to them.</i>

09:34.655 --> 09:35.862
This the right way?

09:35.896 --> 09:37.344
So, it's down
this road.

09:37.379 --> 09:39.137
I think that's gonna be a hill
coming up, we're gonna
head down it.

09:41.137 --> 09:42.931
Wow, we are out in it.

09:42.965 --> 09:46.137
- Look at that.
- We are in the sticks.

09:46.172 --> 09:49.896
<i>Tyler and Danny</i> <i>
head deep into the Kaimata</i> <i>

<i>to locate Maori pounamu hunter</i> <i>

09:55.241 --> 09:56.310
All right.

09:58.275 --> 10:00.758
A little bit.

10:02.241 --> 10:03.206
Hello?

10:05.379 --> 10:06.379
Te Rua?

10:08.620 --> 10:09.620
<i>Hello?</i>

10:17.620 --> 10:19.655
This is a bit small, but...

10:21.172 --> 10:22.206
...it's a nice little plant.

10:23.655 --> 10:25.068
<i>I'd like to make it work.</i>

10:27.517 --> 10:28.655
<i>At Louis Nel's,</i>

10:28.689 --> 10:30.896
<i>Parker is running a test</i> <i>
to determine</i>

<i>if the shaker deck can</i> <i>
recover gold</i>

10:33.172 --> 10:34.689
<i>from clay-ridden pay.</i>

10:37.103 --> 10:39.655
On Indian River, we usually
don't run into too much,

10:39.689 --> 10:42.344
<i>like, really sticky</i> <i>
material, but...</i>

10:42.379 --> 10:44.758
<i>...it's like this kind</i> <i>
of stuff when we do,</i>

10:44.793 --> 10:46.482
<i>springs don't like it much.</i>

10:51.413 --> 10:52.827
<i>I'd like to see what</i> <i>
the tailings look like,</i>

10:52.862 --> 10:54.275
coming off the end
of the conveyor.

10:54.310 --> 10:55.827
Then we'll know
if it's working or not.

11:01.931 --> 11:04.758
There's quite a bit of, uh,
grit left on there.

11:08.379 --> 11:11.275
This is what happens when,
uh, we're not getting
a good enough wash.

11:11.310 --> 11:14.172
Um, it actually leaves
material behind on these.

11:14.206 --> 11:17.034
And over a course of a day,
that's quite a bit
of material you're losing,

11:17.068 --> 11:18.482
so you could lose
a lot of gold.

11:30.551 --> 11:32.206
<i>If you can get</i> <i>
the material washed,</i>

11:32.896 --> 11:36.896
screens are the way to go.

<i>Parker Schnabel</i> <i>

<i>to see if can process</i> <i>
clay-ridden pay.</i>

11:46.344 --> 11:48.689
<i>But so far, the results</i> <i>
aren't good.</i>

11:50.241 --> 11:52.689
Been watching the material
go through.

11:52.724 --> 11:53.965
And, you know,
there's a few rocks

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
with a bit of, uh,
material still left on them.

11:56.034 --> 11:58.724
And, obviously, you know,
over a course
of a day, that's...

11:59.931 --> 12:01.310
...possibly a bit
of a loss, right?

12:01.344 --> 12:03.827
- Well, the problem is on bedrock.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:03.862 --> 12:06.068
That's where
the gold's sitting, right?

12:06.103 --> 12:07.310
Kinda had a look
at the machine,

12:07.344 --> 12:09.172
<i>and I think I can come up</i> <i>
with a bit of a concept</i>

12:09.206 --> 12:11.448
<i>to get a little bit more</i> <i>
wash up top.</i>

12:11.482 --> 12:13.931
See if we can eliminate
some of this, just to see.

12:13.965 --> 12:15.931
- That's why we're here, man. Try out.
- Yeah.

12:18.724 --> 12:21.000
I personally like shaker decks
more than trommels.

12:21.034 --> 12:24.241
<i>And I know Parker really</i> <i>
does like shaker decks.</i>

12:24.275 --> 12:28.137
So I think if I can prove
to him that it can wash
that material as well,

12:28.172 --> 12:29.172
then he might consider it.

12:41.793 --> 12:44.620
<i>Louis's shaker</i> <i>
has a series of spray bars</i>

12:44.655 --> 12:46.551
<i>that loosens pay</i> <i>
from the rocks.</i>

12:46.586 --> 12:50.793
<i>Jeff plans to add a pre-wash</i> <i>
with much higher pressure,</i>

12:50.827 --> 12:54.482
<i>that should break up the clay</i> <i>
and wash the rocks clean.</i>

12:57.034 --> 12:58.896
The thought process is that...

12:59.793 --> 13:01.862
...if you can get
the material washed

13:01.896 --> 13:03.931
<i>before it gets</i> <i>
to the screen deck,</i>

13:03.965 --> 13:06.827
<i>then the screen deck is just</i> <i>
classifying the material.</i>

13:06.862 --> 13:09.103
And so what Jeff's
talking about doing,

13:09.137 --> 13:12.275
<i>is a very valid experiment</i> <i>
to be running.</i>

13:14.793 --> 13:16.344
All right, so, an inch
and a half hose,

13:16.379 --> 13:17.758
that's kinda the first thing
I'm looking for.

13:22.103 --> 13:24.586
<i>Short on time,</i> <i>
Jeff must improvise.</i>

13:27.896 --> 13:31.482
Um, do you have any
nozzles or any pipe fittings
or anything?

13:35.172 --> 13:36.172
That'll work.

13:36.206 --> 13:38.586
Can I bend this up
a little bit?

13:44.448 --> 13:46.517
Parker's brought me here
to be his wash plant guy.

13:46.551 --> 13:48.000
<i>If we go through this trip</i>

13:48.034 --> 13:50.275
<i>and we don't find what</i> <i>
Parker's looking for,</i>

13:50.310 --> 13:52.689
it's a ton of pressure.
It adds a lot of pressure.

13:52.724 --> 13:54.448
Let's try that. Fit in there.

13:58.172 --> 13:59.793
Yeah, I mean,
it's not ideal,

13:59.827 --> 14:03.068
but I just wanna show Parker
that if we get a little bit
more pressure

14:03.103 --> 14:05.206
- in there, a little more water volume.
- Yeah.

14:05.241 --> 14:07.310
It will, uh, it will help. Yeah.

14:07.344 --> 14:09.448
Maybe we'll be able to shoot
Parker from here.

14:12.241 --> 14:13.206
Perfect.

14:16.344 --> 14:17.310
Hello?

14:19.862 --> 14:21.551
Te Rua?

14:21.586 --> 14:23.482
<i>30 miles from</i> <i>
Louis's claim,</i>

14:23.517 --> 14:26.172
<i>on the banks</i> <i>
of the Kaimata River,</i>

14:26.206 --> 14:30.275
<i>Tyler and Danny search</i> <i>
for pounamu hunter Te Rua.</i>

14:30.310 --> 14:31.310
Look, there he is, down there.

14:33.620 --> 14:34.620
Oh, yeah.

14:36.172 --> 14:39.344
- Hello.
- Greetings.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.068
- I'm Tyler.
- Te Rua. You can call me T.

14:42.103 --> 14:43.827
- Nice to meet you, T.
- That's what I'm told.

14:43.862 --> 14:46.413
The reason we're actually here
is because we found

14:46.448 --> 14:49.068
- a quite impressive pounamu stone.
- Oh, yeah?

14:49.103 --> 14:51.586
I'll be willing to receive it
on behalf of our people.

14:51.620 --> 14:53.103
What is it
about pounamu?

14:53.137 --> 14:55.482
'Cause it has such a strong
connection to your culture,
doesn't it?

14:55.517 --> 14:58.413
Pounamu is, um,
brought through all
of our histories.

14:58.448 --> 15:00.034
We started
as a nomadic people,

15:00.068 --> 15:03.379
a lot of heirlooms have been
passed down, are all created
out of pounamu,

15:03.413 --> 15:07.068
and was all, um, transferred
of that energy through
the pounamu,

15:07.103 --> 15:09.275
handed down from generation
to generation to generation,

15:09.310 --> 15:10.862
to, uh, where we
are here today.

15:10.896 --> 15:13.448
And your tattoos
are impressive.

15:13.482 --> 15:16.000
- Yes, they are, thank you.
- Must be a lot of meaning behind them.

15:16.034 --> 15:19.517
My facial one talks about,
um, our family connection
to the pounamu.

15:20.241 --> 15:21.310
- Wow.
- Um, so.

15:21.344 --> 15:23.206
- Can we show it to you, then?
- Yeah.

15:23.241 --> 15:25.551
So, it's just here.

15:25.586 --> 15:28.034
- Is that a good sized one?
- Yeah, that's nice pounamu.

15:29.379 --> 15:31.517
On behalf of our people,
I'd like to thank you
very much.

15:31.551 --> 15:33.137
Thank you.

15:33.172 --> 15:36.931
It'd be cool while we're here,
we actually got to go
prospecting for pounamu.

15:36.965 --> 15:38.793
- Would that be possible?
- Yeah, I think so.

15:38.827 --> 15:40.137
It's a good day for it.

15:40.172 --> 15:41.413
How do you come upon it?

15:41.448 --> 15:43.758
You're looking
for those splashes of green,

15:43.793 --> 15:45.655
where somebody's just
got a paintbrush
and just flicked it.

15:45.689 --> 15:49.034
But, you know, without it
being a hocus-pocus
sort of story, it's, uh,

15:49.068 --> 15:50.172
sort of like love.

15:50.206 --> 15:51.793
Some people can search for it
their whole life

15:51.827 --> 15:53.655
and they'll never understand
what it's about.

15:53.689 --> 15:55.482
But when looking for a piece
of pounamu,

15:55.517 --> 15:58.862
once you find it,
there's a connection between
you and the stone.

15:58.896 --> 16:00.275
It's just something
that's meant to be.

16:00.310 --> 16:04.206
Is it true that pounamu
and gold are found
together often?

16:04.241 --> 16:05.482
Uh, that seems
to be the way.

16:05.517 --> 16:07.620
Do you mind, actually,
if I get my metal detector out

16:07.655 --> 16:09.827
and have a prospect for gold?

16:09.862 --> 16:12.000
I think it'll
be a perfect opportunity.

16:12.034 --> 16:13.137
Cool.

16:13.172 --> 16:14.517
All right, I'm gonna
turn this on.

16:16.310 --> 16:17.862
Well, just make your way
up around here

16:17.896 --> 16:20.310
and you can have
a bit of a hunt.
You might get lucky.

16:20.344 --> 16:22.793
Awesome, I'll follow
your lead.

16:22.827 --> 16:25.724
This will be cool if we
could find some gold
and some pounamu.

16:27.344 --> 16:28.896
<i>Gold and pounamu</i>

16:28.931 --> 16:32.620
<i>formed around the fault line</i> <i>
between tectonic plates.</i>

16:32.655 --> 16:35.172
<i>When these collided to create</i> <i>
the Southern Alps,</i>

16:35.206 --> 16:38.689
<i>the gold and pounamu</i> <i>
were also pushed up.</i>

16:38.724 --> 16:42.344
<i>Since then, glaciers have</i> <i>
plucked both from the rocks,</i>

16:42.379 --> 16:45.551
<i>carrying them down</i> <i>
to the rivers together.</i>

16:45.586 --> 16:47.206
So when the big
floods come through,

16:47.241 --> 16:49.965
- it must just refresh it all.
- Yup, refreshes it, start again.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.827
So after big rains,
you guys tend to come down?

16:51.862 --> 16:53.517
- Definitely.
- Do you ring the boss up and say,

16:53.551 --> 16:55.965
"I'm not going to work,
I'm going hunting"?

16:56.000 --> 16:57.931
Well, no, I tell
the boss that I'm sick.

17:01.689 --> 17:03.517
Oh.

17:05.689 --> 17:07.586
Oh, goodness,
I've actually got a signal.

17:07.620 --> 17:09.586
Well, I didn't think
we're in nugget country.

17:09.620 --> 17:11.931
- Do people find nuggets here?
- We're in nugget country.

17:11.965 --> 17:14.034
- Are we?
- Yes, we are.

17:17.241 --> 17:18.551
We'll just scrape it.

17:21.172 --> 17:23.620
- Oh,
- Oh, there it is, eh?

17:23.655 --> 17:26.758
What is that?

17:26.793 --> 17:29.793
It's like an anchor
or something.

17:29.827 --> 17:31.379
Okay, I'm just gonna
have a break from that.

17:31.413 --> 17:32.793
I wanna concentrate
on the pounamu,

17:32.827 --> 17:34.344
I can't do two things
at... oh!

17:34.379 --> 17:35.344
Oh, that's a leaf.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.586
<i>Big plan here</i> <i>
is to make sure that</i>

17:45.620 --> 17:47.000
<i>the material comes out</i> <i>
a lot more clean.</i>

17:47.034 --> 17:49.793
<i>Hopefully it works for Parker.</i>

17:49.827 --> 17:52.689
<i>To find out</i> <i>
if the shaker deck</i> <i>
can process clay,</i>

17:52.724 --> 17:55.206
<i>Jeff is rigging</i> <i>
a pre-wash system</i>

17:55.241 --> 17:57.103
<i>using a high-pressure</i> <i>
water jet.</i>

17:58.172 --> 18:00.103
I'm actually really
torn about

18:00.137 --> 18:02.310
<i>screen decks versus trommels,</i>

18:02.344 --> 18:04.827
because screens, to me,

18:04.862 --> 18:08.482
are more simple
and easier to work on.

18:08.517 --> 18:11.862
<i>And those are two</i> <i>
of the biggest factors</i>

18:11.896 --> 18:13.379
<i>that we need to consider.</i>

18:13.413 --> 18:15.482
<i>To clean</i> <i>
the sticky clay,</i>

18:15.517 --> 18:19.068
<i>the jet must hit the rocks</i> <i>
with a force of 50 psi.</i>

18:28.000 --> 18:29.586
That's not gonna
be enough pressure.

18:31.103 --> 18:32.965
I was hoping for, like,
a jet,

18:33.000 --> 18:34.172
not like a piss stream.

18:34.724 --> 18:35.862
Nice try, Jeff.

18:36.551 --> 18:37.896
Oh, what a pain.

18:39.482 --> 18:41.103
Looks like they have
some real water problems.

18:45.482 --> 18:47.448
<i>I get what Jeff</i> <i>
is trying to do.</i>

18:47.482 --> 18:49.793
But you just can't do that
with a garden hose.

18:56.620 --> 18:58.689
Brought in the reinforcements.

18:59.586 --> 19:01.034
<i>Once we ran the hose</i> <i>
to the top</i>

19:01.068 --> 19:03.103
there just wasn't
enough pressure, so Plan B.

19:05.965 --> 19:07.793
<i>Jeff's called</i> <i>
in Louis's water truck,</i>

19:07.827 --> 19:10.137
<i>equipped with a high</i> <i>
pressure pump.</i>

19:23.793 --> 19:24.793
There we go.

19:56.931 --> 19:57.931
Yeah.

20:07.448 --> 20:09.206
<i>Proof of the test's success</i>

20:09.241 --> 20:11.137
<i>will be in the tailings.</i>

20:11.172 --> 20:12.724
<i>The biggest problem</i> <i>
we've got right now</i>

20:12.758 --> 20:14.206
is we're up against it
for time.

20:14.241 --> 20:17.689
Like, if we don't find a plant
in-country to buy,

20:17.724 --> 20:20.034
that we can move to Fairbanks
in time,

20:20.068 --> 20:21.034
it's gonna be a disaster.

20:31.068 --> 20:32.827
I guess once
you have an eye for it,

20:32.862 --> 20:34.206
- it becomes a lot easier.
- Yep.

20:34.241 --> 20:35.827
It's about
having an eye in.

20:35.862 --> 20:39.137
It takes people
their whole life
to sometimes get their eye,

20:39.172 --> 20:40.310
some don't even get it.

20:40.344 --> 20:41.620
<i>At the foot</i>

20:41.655 --> 20:43.517
<i>of New Zealand's</i> <i>
Southern Alps,</i>

20:43.551 --> 20:48.517
<i>Te Rua, Tyler and Danny</i> <i>
are hunting for valuable</i> <i>
green stone.</i>

20:49.793 --> 20:51.206
Even if you
don't find anything,

20:51.241 --> 20:54.000
it's just beautiful being
out here and listening
to the...

20:54.034 --> 20:56.310
listening to the sounds
of the water. Um...

20:56.344 --> 20:57.586
You sound a lot
like my dad.

20:57.620 --> 20:59.034
He always says
when you're out wandering

20:59.068 --> 21:01.689
in the bush and just enjoying
the nature and everything,

21:01.724 --> 21:03.068
that's when you come
across gold.

21:03.103 --> 21:04.896
Exactly the same
with the pounamu.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.068
You've gotta be like water.

21:06.103 --> 21:07.000
You gotta become it.

21:08.379 --> 21:10.344
And so, the particular sort
of stone that we're

21:10.379 --> 21:12.724
looking for is, um,
is either gonna be

21:12.758 --> 21:15.310
a beautiful dock leaf green

21:15.344 --> 21:18.379
or it's gonna be
a chalky white.

21:18.413 --> 21:20.896
- That's chalky.
- Yep, now you're getting your eye.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.413
You're getting closer.
You're getting closer.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.620
But that's not
quite chalky enough.

21:23.655 --> 21:25.241
No, that's not chalky enough.

21:25.275 --> 21:28.379
That speckled look
isn't it, is it?

21:28.413 --> 21:30.241
No, no.
That's, that's not it.

21:30.275 --> 21:32.206
This is
kind of chalky.

21:32.241 --> 21:34.000
It's a bit big, isn't it?

21:34.034 --> 21:35.344
Yep, you wanna know
what color?

21:35.379 --> 21:37.620
That's exactly what
we're looking for right there.

21:37.655 --> 21:39.379
No way!

21:39.413 --> 21:41.241
That's exactly what
we're looking for right there.

21:41.275 --> 21:43.344
- Oh, my That's green.
- Yes.

21:44.241 --> 21:45.413
Oh, my

21:45.448 --> 21:47.206
So that's,
that's the white,
that's the, um,

21:47.241 --> 21:49.448
the smoothness
and that chalkiness

21:49.482 --> 21:50.689
right there
that we're talking about.

21:50.724 --> 21:52.310
That's white.

21:52.344 --> 21:55.034
- We're in the money.
- It's huge!

21:56.827 --> 21:58.689
When whenever
we find a smaller one,

21:58.724 --> 22:00.413
we always look around
and ask ourselves,

22:00.448 --> 22:01.793
"Where's your big brother
or something?"

22:01.827 --> 22:03.241
Oh, yeah.

22:03.275 --> 22:04.862
- But, um...
- Surely this is as big as they get.

22:04.896 --> 22:06.758
It looks like
we found the big brother.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.862
Um...

22:08.896 --> 22:10.206
So how much
is it worth?

22:10.241 --> 22:11.689
In this instance, uh,
we're looking

22:11.724 --> 22:13.068
at a couple
hundred pound, easy.

22:13.103 --> 22:16.344
That could range anywhere
from $10,000 to $15,000 raw.

22:16.379 --> 22:17.689
- Far out.
- Yeah.

22:19.103 --> 22:21.862
<i>Worth up</i> <i>
to $10,000 US dollars,</i>

22:21.896 --> 22:25.482
<i>the pounamu is carved</i> <i>
into unique pieces</i> <i>
of jewelry</i>

22:25.517 --> 22:27.137
<i>by Te Rua's tribe,</i>

22:27.172 --> 22:29.413
<i>potentially tripling</i> <i>
its value.</i>

22:31.793 --> 22:33.586
I think the best way
to acknowledge this,

22:33.620 --> 22:35.000
it's just, uh, it's just
to give thanks

22:35.034 --> 22:36.000
to this place here.

22:47.413 --> 22:49.448
I'd like to give you
a hongi, Tyler.

22:49.482 --> 22:51.000
So when we have a hongi...

22:51.034 --> 22:53.137
So it's just, uh, a light
touching of the nose

22:53.172 --> 22:54.896
and of our foreheads.

22:54.931 --> 22:58.137
And just a slight inhaling,
just through the nose,

22:58.172 --> 22:59.068
the breath of life.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.344
Yeah.

23:16.379 --> 23:18.517
<i>Before Parker</i> <i>
can decide if Louis'</i>

23:18.551 --> 23:20.275
<i>shaker deck is the one,</i>

23:20.310 --> 23:22.655
<i>he needs to see</i> <i>
if Jeff's bush fix</i>

23:22.689 --> 23:24.758
<i>successfully washed away</i> <i>
the clay.</i>

23:29.137 --> 23:31.275
As you can see they're
definitely a lot cleaner.

23:31.310 --> 23:33.206
- The task did work.
- Sweet.

23:33.241 --> 23:36.413
And obviously
in a perfect world,
we'd do a few modifications

23:36.448 --> 23:37.517
to make that a lot better,

23:37.551 --> 23:39.448
but it, uh, gets
the concept across.

23:39.482 --> 23:43.344
I mean, It does make me
start to lean towards
a screen a bit more

23:43.379 --> 23:45.000
because you can get
the throughput

23:45.034 --> 23:46.551
in a smaller footprint,
you know.

23:46.586 --> 23:48.965
- Yep.
- Trommels are huge

23:49.000 --> 23:51.206
to get a 180
or more yards an hour

23:51.241 --> 23:52.241
- out of.
- They are.

23:52.275 --> 23:54.448
If you can combine the wash

23:54.482 --> 23:56.413
that you get out of trommel
with a screen deck

23:56.448 --> 23:57.379
by just hammering water to it,

23:57.413 --> 24:00.551
you're getting
all that broken up.

24:00.586 --> 24:02.275
You get the throughput
of a screen deck

24:02.310 --> 24:03.551
with the wash of a trommel...

24:04.551 --> 24:06.517
Sounds like a win-win.

24:06.551 --> 24:07.965
Yeah, the problem is
we're not gonna

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
- find that plant for sale.
- No.

24:11.034 --> 24:14.620
So we might still be
better off getting something
that works

24:14.655 --> 24:17.517
that's in time, rather than
what's perfect.

24:17.551 --> 24:18.620
- Right?
- Hmm-mmm.

24:22.034 --> 24:23.517
If Parker bought this
shaker deck here,

24:23.551 --> 24:26.344
<i>he would have to do quite</i> <i>
a bit of modifications</i>

24:26.379 --> 24:27.931
<i>to make it work</i> <i>
for his ground.</i>

24:27.965 --> 24:32.241
So I'm not sure whether
or not he's decided himself

24:32.275 --> 24:35.000
whether he wants
a trommel or a shaker deck.

24:35.034 --> 24:39.275
I came on this trip thinking
that while it's a good thing
that there's lots of trommels

24:39.310 --> 24:40.965
in New Zealand
'cause I want a trommel

24:41.000 --> 24:45.655
<i>and now I'm like maybe</i> <i>
we want a screen deck.</i>

24:45.689 --> 24:47.620
<i>If I was forced to make</i> <i>
a decision today,</i>

24:48.379 --> 24:49.241
<i>I'd be like...</i>

24:50.413 --> 24:51.965
<i>screen deck.</i>

24:52.000 --> 24:54.103
But yesterday, I was trying
to buy a trommel.

24:54.137 --> 24:57.551
We've got still a few
other sites and plants
to look at,

24:57.586 --> 24:58.689
but I've got your number.

24:58.724 --> 25:00.517
Thanks for everything.

25:00.551 --> 25:02.551
- Really appreciate it.
- Thanks, Louis. That was awesome

25:02.586 --> 25:04.379
Thanks for letting me
do those tests.

25:04.413 --> 25:06.931
We better go find, um,
Old Danny and Tyler.

25:09.551 --> 25:12.137
<i>The worst decision that</i> <i>
I could possibly make</i> <i>
is no decision.</i>

25:13.862 --> 25:15.758
Can't
stand indecision.

25:21.310 --> 25:22.379
Did you bring beer?

25:29.448 --> 25:31.241
It's getting dark.

25:31.275 --> 25:35.241
<i>With the sun</i> <i>
setting, the team head</i> <i>
to a nearby farm.</i>

25:40.172 --> 25:41.275
- Hello!
- How is it going?

25:41.310 --> 25:42.724
Where are you all going?

25:42.758 --> 25:45.620
Uh, well, we were
actually just looking
for a place to camp.

25:47.103 --> 25:48.689
Oh, yeah.

25:48.724 --> 25:51.206
I could put you somewhere
where you can go for a camp
for the night.

25:56.724 --> 25:58.827
- Now, if you wanna follow me.
- Thank you.

26:06.413 --> 26:09.172
Or he's taking us to a place to kill us all.

26:09.206 --> 26:11.689
- I think it's a puzzle.
- Parker, could you please not do this to me

26:11.724 --> 26:14.206
'cause I have anxiety
about being murdered

26:14.241 --> 26:15.586
- Do you?
- Yes.

26:15.620 --> 26:17.517
- Well, this is how it happens, okay?
- Oh, definitely.

26:17.551 --> 26:19.413
You could get
buried out here
and you'd have no idea.

26:27.241 --> 26:30.068
Guys, this is
textbook Wolf Creek Murder.

26:30.103 --> 26:33.379
The cows will leave you alone,
but, other than that,
try and keep warm and...

26:33.413 --> 26:34.413
Yeah.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.344
Where should we set up camp?

26:55.965 --> 26:59.586
Tyler, I put a wrench
in the back of the seat
on your side.

26:59.620 --> 27:01.758
Can you just see
if you can grab that?

27:09.068 --> 27:10.034
That was good.

27:13.103 --> 27:14.482
I weed myself.

27:15.482 --> 27:16.724
Ah!

27:16.758 --> 27:17.827
and then peed yourself.

27:19.482 --> 27:20.413
Oh, wow.

27:22.413 --> 27:25.310
Today it was
really nice that Danny
and I got to split away

27:25.344 --> 27:27.724
from that wash plant talk
and go and do
something different.

27:27.758 --> 27:30.448
Um, and I kind of feel
like it refreshed the team

27:30.482 --> 27:31.862
once we do
get back together, but...

27:32.896 --> 27:36.206
to be honest though,
I was hoping

27:36.241 --> 27:38.379
that we'd leave Louis Nel's
for the final time

27:39.275 --> 27:41.413
with a really clear direction.

27:41.448 --> 27:45.689
Parker's gonna still
humming and hawing

27:45.724 --> 27:48.275
whether it's a trommel
or it's a shaker.

27:48.310 --> 27:50.758
And personally, it's starting
to stress me out.

27:50.793 --> 27:53.068
Um, 'cause I've never really
seen Parker like this.

27:53.103 --> 27:57.758
The Parker I know
is fiercely... fierce
with his decision making.

27:57.793 --> 28:00.000
He's hard and fast.
He knows what he wants.

28:00.034 --> 28:03.034
We're gonna have to wait
to see what he...
wait to see what he does.

28:06.206 --> 28:07.482
Hopefully it's not too late.

28:20.034 --> 28:21.241
Where we're off
to, then, Tyler?

28:21.275 --> 28:23.310
Um, so we're
gonna see a wash plant
for sale.

28:23.344 --> 28:24.482
It's Groundhog Day.

28:26.172 --> 28:29.482
<i>With only</i> <i>
seven weeks until the start</i> <i>
of the season,</i>

28:29.517 --> 28:32.379
<i>Parker is still undecided</i> <i>
on a wash plant</i>

28:32.413 --> 28:34.310
<i>for his new Alaskan venture.</i>

28:35.517 --> 28:37.724
Now we're chewing
through these viewings now.

28:37.758 --> 28:41.310
And it's not really
about quantity as much
as it is quality.

28:41.344 --> 28:43.310
Well, yeah, but I think
it's fair to say there was

28:43.344 --> 28:45.137
a fair bit of quality
at Louis Nel's.

28:45.172 --> 28:47.689
I am worried that it doesn't
really get better
than Louis Nel's.

28:47.724 --> 28:51.413
So just a head's up, Parker,
around here it's gonna be
slim pickings.

28:51.448 --> 28:53.758
Anything special
about this one
we're gonna see.

28:53.793 --> 28:56.034
I think it's got
hydraulic legs.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.068
- Is it another trommel?
- Another trommel.

28:58.103 --> 29:00.275
We have seen
a lot of trommels now.

29:00.310 --> 29:02.344
There's just not
a lot of shaker decks.

29:02.379 --> 29:05.000
Have you thought anymore
about that, Parker?

29:05.034 --> 29:06.448
Yeah, I've thought about it.

29:10.206 --> 29:14.068
<i>From Ruatapu,</i> <i>
Tyler's final plant</i> <i>
on the West Coast</i>

29:14.103 --> 29:19.413
<i>is 18 miles northeast,</i> <i>
near the historic
goldmining town of Kumara.</i>

29:24.793 --> 29:26.344
- Hello!
- Hello.

29:26.379 --> 29:27.551
Nice to meet you.

29:27.586 --> 29:30.551
- What's your name?
- Thomas, but everyone calls me TC.

29:30.586 --> 29:32.379
- How long have you worked here?
- A year and a half.

29:32.413 --> 29:34.551
- What did you do before that?
- Coal mining.

29:34.586 --> 29:36.172
Big tractors.

29:36.206 --> 29:38.551
Uh, the head of big tractor
up there are 475.

29:38.586 --> 29:41.310
- But you didn't get to use it.
- No, unfortunately I wasn't that age yet at 50.

29:41.344 --> 29:44.137
- Some old grumpy guy got to run the 475, right?
- Yep.

29:44.172 --> 29:45.724
But you're not old
and grumpy, right? Are you?

29:45.758 --> 29:47.103
- I don't run a tractor.
- No.

29:48.655 --> 29:50.827
Is there a lot
of gold in this ground?

29:50.862 --> 29:52.206
Ah, there is a bit, yeah.

29:52.241 --> 29:54.620
We've, um, we come across
a lot up against
the road edge there.

29:54.655 --> 29:56.586
It's a bit,
it's a bit deeper than we like
to do normally.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.137
Right.

29:58.172 --> 29:59.689
- But, um...
- Tell me you've just told us more

29:59.724 --> 30:02.827
about how much gold
you're catching than
all the other miners combined

30:02.862 --> 30:04.586
that we've filmed since being in New Zealand.

30:04.620 --> 30:06.137
I didn't tell you how much.

30:06.172 --> 30:10.137
- You've said a lot.
- You're making him really nervous.

30:12.689 --> 30:14.931
I spoke to your boss
on the phone and he said
this was for sale.

30:14.965 --> 30:16.344
Sure is.

30:16.379 --> 30:19.793
- How old is it?
- It's same as for your dash. I'll say that much.

30:19.827 --> 30:21.827
But so we catch
this gold, so...

30:21.862 --> 30:24.137
- That's what matters, right?
- Exactly.

30:24.172 --> 30:25.655
- Moves pretty easily.
- Pretty mobile, yeah.

30:25.689 --> 30:27.758
- Yeah?
- Hydraulic legs, right?

30:27.793 --> 30:29.655
Yeah, they make
it really easy to level.

30:30.137 --> 30:31.000
Good stuff.

30:33.068 --> 30:37.137
<i>Parker needs</i> <i>
a wash plant that is mobile</i> <i>
for his claim in Alaska.</i>

30:37.172 --> 30:42.896
<i>This 20-ton trommel has</i> <i>
a price tag of $190,000.</i>

30:42.931 --> 30:46.655
<i>Built on skids</i> <i>
for maximum movability.</i>

30:46.689 --> 30:52.241
<i>It's USP is four</i> <i>
hydraulic legs to level</i> <i>
the plant easily and quickly.</i>

30:54.551 --> 30:56.724
But, like, if you're gonna
see it running,
we gotta move it.

30:56.758 --> 30:59.000
- All right, well, can we give you a hand?
- Yeah.

30:59.413 --> 31:01.413
All right, sweet.

31:01.448 --> 31:04.620
One thing that Parker wanted
to see a lot of was mobility.

31:04.655 --> 31:07.103
<i>This is good because we get</i> <i>
to see it moving and the fact</i>

31:07.137 --> 31:09.827
it's got the hydraulics
on the bottom of it is a plus.

31:09.862 --> 31:12.689
The only problem is it's got
a heavy stacker on it,
so when we turn it

31:12.724 --> 31:14.793
we have to try stop it from,
uh, falling over.

31:14.827 --> 31:16.275
Oh, no.

31:18.655 --> 31:20.862
I'll give you the nice new one.

31:20.896 --> 31:22.620
- Well, we'll see what happens.
- Yeah.

31:24.896 --> 31:26.620
<i>I've seen</i> <i>
a couple plant moves.</i>

31:26.655 --> 31:28.413
But they always make me
a little bit nervous,
you know.

31:28.448 --> 31:29.482
There's a lot
that could go wrong.

31:29.517 --> 31:31.379
<i>It's a heavy thing</i> <i>
to be moving around</i>

31:31.413 --> 31:33.448
<i>and there's a lot of parts</i> <i>
coming off of it and stuff.</i>

31:33.482 --> 31:36.241
And especially,
when you need two diggers
to move the one plant

31:36.275 --> 31:39.241
is you know,
double the space for error.

31:39.275 --> 31:40.448
Here they come.

31:41.206 --> 31:42.758
Brother and sister.

31:45.551 --> 31:46.862
Which side do you want?

31:46.896 --> 31:48.310
I'll go in the back
and lift the back up.

31:48.344 --> 31:50.586
I'll move over there.
Then you jump
on that front corner.

31:50.620 --> 31:51.724
And pull her around.

31:53.103 --> 31:55.896
- You got some, uh, shackles.
- Yeah.

31:55.931 --> 32:00.137
<i>To move</i> <i>
the 19-foot tall,</i> <i>
20-ton plant uphill</i>

32:00.172 --> 32:02.206
<i>to the new mining pad,</i>

32:02.241 --> 32:04.620
<i>Parker's excavator</i> <i>
will pull from the front,</i>

32:04.655 --> 32:08.413
<i>while TC steers at the back.</i>

32:08.448 --> 32:12.275
So, yeah, the only thing
really to watch out for
is the stacker, obviously.

32:12.310 --> 32:13.689
- Yeah, don't hit the stacker.
- Don't hit the stacker.

32:13.724 --> 32:14.655
Got it.

32:14.689 --> 32:16.862
Um, I see it's already
a little bit bent.

32:18.137 --> 32:20.103
- That wasn't me.
- Yeah, alrighty then.

32:20.862 --> 32:22.275
I break it. I buy it?

32:22.310 --> 32:23.931
You break it. You buy it.
That's for sure.

32:29.586 --> 32:31.034
<i>All right, Parker.</i> <i>
Are you ready?</i>

32:31.068 --> 32:32.034
Yep!

32:43.620 --> 32:45.793
So much pressure
on those chains.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.413
<i>One thing</i> <i>
with the chains is you can</i>

32:48.448 --> 32:49.862
<i>never tell</i> <i>
where it's gonna break.</i>

32:49.896 --> 32:51.034
They just break.

32:51.068 --> 32:53.172
Make them
fire off to the side.

32:53.206 --> 32:54.896
Oh, you don't wanna be
in the bait.

33:10.068 --> 33:12.689
- Just right there.
- And that looks good.

33:16.103 --> 33:17.482
Went super good.

33:17.517 --> 33:20.413
Nice, easy pullout.
Nice, easy pull back.
A little bit of a twist.

33:20.448 --> 33:22.379
- All right, what's next?
- We gotta level up.

33:22.413 --> 33:23.586
The fun part.

33:23.620 --> 33:25.034
Some meaty jacks!

33:25.068 --> 33:26.689
Some meaty jacks. Yeah.
They're off for digging.

33:26.724 --> 33:29.000
I was just gonna say
they're off an excavator,
aren't they?

33:32.344 --> 33:34.379
Yeah, it's stooping down
in the back.

33:34.413 --> 33:35.379
And then, we're...

33:35.965 --> 33:37.310
We're high on that side.

33:37.344 --> 33:40.586
<i>Wash plants must</i> <i>
run as level as possible.</i>

33:40.620 --> 33:44.275
<i>Running off-center unevenly</i> <i>
packs the sluice box</i>

33:44.310 --> 33:47.241
<i>preventing the gold</i> <i>
from being caught</i> <i>
in the riffles</i>

33:47.275 --> 33:49.310
<i>and lost off the end</i> <i>
of the sluice.</i>

33:58.379 --> 34:02.103
<i>It takes Parker a day</i> <i>
to level his Yukon plants.</i>

34:02.137 --> 34:06.310
<i>The hydraulic legs can achieve</i> <i>
the same results in minutes.</i>

34:08.275 --> 34:11.344
- That's level there.
- That was relatively easy.

34:11.379 --> 34:13.965
Jeff, that's sweet.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.448
- That's pretty sweet.
- Yeah.

34:15.482 --> 34:17.758
Way overbuilt. Super simple.

34:18.862 --> 34:20.172
Okay, let's get
this water going.

34:21.586 --> 34:23.310
This pipeline
is getting hooked up
to that hose?

34:23.344 --> 34:24.206
Yeah.

34:25.620 --> 34:27.206
So now we just need
to get it running.

34:27.827 --> 34:29.379
Get Jeff's eyes on it.

34:29.413 --> 34:30.793
And who knows.
Parker might wanna buy it.

34:33.379 --> 34:36.034
These little plants
like this are super easy
to move.

34:36.068 --> 34:40.896
I mean, this actually
really does fit the bill
in terms of portability.

34:40.931 --> 34:42.724
Cheap as peanuts to run too.

34:46.724 --> 34:50.965
Yeah, I like how slick
those leveling jacks are.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.517
Like they're actually
x-ramps off an excavator.

34:53.551 --> 34:56.793
Um, excavator is just like
super heavy duty,

34:56.827 --> 35:00.620
like you could pick up
a plant twice the size
with those jacks.

35:01.517 --> 35:02.965
All right, what now?

35:05.689 --> 35:06.793
Sweet!

35:13.586 --> 35:14.965
Here comes the water.

35:23.275 --> 35:26.379
<i>At the moment, I think</i> <i>
he might still be considering</i> <i>
buying this plant,</i>

35:26.413 --> 35:29.586
but, uh, we never know
what Parker is thinking.

35:29.620 --> 35:32.517
<i>And until we get his word,</i> <i>
everything is gonna be</i> <i>
at a standstill</i>

35:32.551 --> 35:33.896
<i>for the start of next season.</i>

35:33.931 --> 35:36.068
So I want him
to hurry the up
so we can get this going.

35:37.586 --> 35:38.793
You got a few minutes?

35:38.827 --> 35:40.620
- What's up?
- Come take a look.

35:41.310 --> 35:42.551
Yeah, hey.

35:42.586 --> 35:45.551
- TC, will you run this?
- Yeah, I'll run that. Yeah.

35:45.586 --> 35:46.655
Trade you out.

35:49.517 --> 35:52.586
- What's up?
- Well, I just had a good look around.

35:53.413 --> 35:55.000
Everything looks pretty good.

35:55.034 --> 35:56.517
It's got the leveling jacks.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Got a conveyor.

35:58.862 --> 36:01.827
Got a self-cleaning system
up top.

36:01.862 --> 36:03.413
What do you, uh...
What do you think?

36:08.034 --> 36:10.000
- Too small.
- Uh...

36:10.034 --> 36:11.206
It's a little bit small.

36:25.896 --> 36:26.689
Here we are.

36:27.689 --> 36:29.517
Kiwi Wild Lodge.

36:31.827 --> 36:33.517
<i>Unique to New Zealand,</i>

36:33.551 --> 36:37.793
<i>Kiwi birds are</i> <i>
on the endangered list.</i>

36:37.827 --> 36:41.034
I'm gonna shine
a light in here and tell me
if you can see it.

36:41.068 --> 36:42.965
<i>Flightless and nocturnal,</i>

36:43.000 --> 36:47.206
<i>Kiwis have an unexpected</i> <i>
feature to help</i> <i>
navigate the dark.</i>

36:47.241 --> 36:49.379
It's got like whiskers.

36:49.413 --> 36:51.620
If you'd like to,
you can touch this kiwi.

36:51.655 --> 36:53.758
Have a little feel, feel this,
just gently.

36:56.862 --> 36:59.482
<i>Despite being</i> <i>
born ready to run,</i>

36:59.517 --> 37:04.758
<i>only 2% of these</i> <i>
defenseless birds</i> <i>
make it to adulthood.</i>

37:04.793 --> 37:06.655
Slide kiwi back in there.

37:12.620 --> 37:13.862
It's a little bit small.

37:15.379 --> 37:16.655
Is that something
you can work around?

37:17.655 --> 37:19.000
- No.
- No?

37:20.517 --> 37:22.275
<i>Midway through the run,</i>

37:22.310 --> 37:25.275
<i>Parker shuts down</i> <i>
the test of TC's trommel.</i>

37:25.310 --> 37:28.000
Like it's perfect.
It's just too small.

37:28.034 --> 37:30.689
<i>Gunning for a big pay day</i> <i>
in Alaska,</i>

37:30.724 --> 37:33.896
<i>Parker needs</i> <i>
a plant that can chew</i> <i>
through the ground.</i>

37:36.206 --> 37:39.758
Well, my biggest thing is,
you know, we're getting
pretty late into this trip.

37:39.793 --> 37:42.034
We've seen
some pretty good stuff,

37:42.068 --> 37:44.931
but, uh, we haven't jump
on anything yet.

37:44.965 --> 37:47.310
It's, uh... It's got me
kind of worried
for timing right now.

37:48.206 --> 37:50.551
New season
is coming pretty fast.

37:50.586 --> 37:54.413
I feel like I'm
starting to get at the end
of my contact list.

37:54.448 --> 37:55.620
It's getting hard.

37:55.655 --> 37:58.206
Like I'm scrapping
the bottom of the barrel here.

37:58.241 --> 38:00.344
Listen,
the thing is, man.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.517
The reality here is you still
haven't actually chosen

38:02.551 --> 38:04.344
what type of plant you want.

38:04.379 --> 38:07.344
You should probably be
at that stage by now.

38:07.379 --> 38:09.689
If I knew which one I want,
we wouldn't be
in this country.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.172
That's why we're on this trip.

38:12.206 --> 38:14.068
Well,
I know it is, but...

38:14.103 --> 38:16.000
we're quite
a long way into it.

38:16.034 --> 38:18.827
Surely, like, if you,
if you could make
that decision,

38:18.862 --> 38:21.172
then we can move on
to the next step.

38:21.206 --> 38:23.448
And that gets
the ball rolling, right?

38:24.586 --> 38:25.655
I'm leaving.

38:27.206 --> 38:29.896
Don't tell me
what the to do, Danny.

38:35.310 --> 38:36.310
That didn't go great.

38:37.310 --> 38:38.413
No, it didn't.

38:42.172 --> 38:43.931
I feel like I'm losing
this battle here.

38:46.724 --> 38:49.689
<i>This plant is decent.</i> <i>
It would do the job for him.</i>

38:49.724 --> 38:51.172
<i>So, yeah.</i>

38:51.206 --> 38:54.310
It's kind of a bit of a blow
that he's not interested
in this one.

38:54.344 --> 38:56.689
<i>So that's that.</i> <i>
It's got me a bit worried.</i>

38:56.724 --> 38:58.758
We need a plant
for our season coming.

38:58.793 --> 39:01.896
We've been out here for,
you know, quite a while now.

39:01.931 --> 39:03.517
We've seen quite
a few wash plants.

39:03.551 --> 39:05.034
<i>He's not buying them.</i>

39:05.068 --> 39:08.241
<i>They're not meeting</i> <i>
his requirements</i> <i>
or his standards.</i>

39:08.275 --> 39:10.689
<i>So we need</i> <i>
to carry on looking.</i>

39:10.724 --> 39:13.310
<i>But we also need</i> <i>
to nail down what he wants.</i>

39:13.344 --> 39:14.103
Otherwise...

39:15.551 --> 39:17.827
I don't think Alaska
is going to be a thing.

39:29.137 --> 39:30.965
We've seen
a lot of wash plants now.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.034
Don't you think sometimes
you might have bitten off
a little bit

39:33.068 --> 39:34.655
more than you can chew.

39:34.689 --> 39:36.068
Sometimes.

39:36.103 --> 39:39.896
Um, I wouldn't say
that I've bitten off more
than we can chew.

39:39.931 --> 39:43.379
I'm more scared
of just like to pull
the trigger on anything.

39:44.896 --> 39:47.068
I haven't
pulled at any triggers

39:47.103 --> 39:49.206
on any big ticket item
for Fairbanks, yet

39:49.241 --> 39:50.206
because I'm like [bleep],

39:50.241 --> 39:53.275
do I really want to spend
that $5 million?

39:54.724 --> 39:57.793
It will spend before we pull
an ounce of gold
out of the ground.

39:59.344 --> 40:00.793
Like you could retire
with that.

40:00.827 --> 40:02.482
It's a lot
of money. Mmm.

40:02.517 --> 40:06.517
It's just like do you really
want to dump it all back
into the next project?

40:06.551 --> 40:08.172
- You know.
- Hmm-mmm.

40:08.206 --> 40:09.655
Do you think you're making
decisions like that

40:09.689 --> 40:11.034
because it's kind
of in your blood?

40:11.068 --> 40:13.620
It's definitely...
It's a part
of this family thing.

40:13.655 --> 40:17.413
My grandpa and my dad
never paid themselves
anything out of the companies.

40:17.448 --> 40:20.241
And just like pumped it
all back into the business.

40:20.275 --> 40:22.896
My grandpa didn't work
the last time
he did it, right?

40:22.931 --> 40:25.241
Like his sawmill
went bankrupt.

40:26.241 --> 40:28.000
But, yeah, I don't know.

40:28.034 --> 40:31.931
I really, in the next, like,
while I'm on this trip, I have
to start making the decision

40:31.965 --> 40:33.689
and start spending
lots of money.

40:33.724 --> 40:35.206
Like Jeff's pushing me.

40:35.241 --> 40:37.793
- I don't wanna push you hard 'cause I know you know.
- I know.

40:37.827 --> 40:39.758
- And I know.
- I know. I know that you know that I know.

40:39.793 --> 40:40.689
Yeah.

40:40.724 --> 40:42.793
That's like skydiving.

40:42.827 --> 40:45.103
I need somebody
to boot me
out the door

40:45.137 --> 40:45.965
and then we're flying.

40:46.000 --> 40:46.931
I'll do it.

40:46.965 --> 40:48.310
Perfect.

40:48.344 --> 40:50.586
I'm going to bed.

40:50.620 --> 40:52.379
- Cheers, mate.
- Cheers.

40:52.413 --> 40:55.896
Dan got me
thinking tonight about
the whole Fairbanks project.

40:55.931 --> 40:59.793
And just like, you know,
the financial side of it.

41:02.931 --> 41:04.275
It's definitely, um...

41:06.724 --> 41:07.896
a bit daunting.

41:07.931 --> 41:09.482
Like I'm used
to spending a lot of money,

41:09.517 --> 41:13.827
but there's also, you know,
a lot of money coming in.

41:13.862 --> 41:17.482
Um, when you're setting up
a new project, it's like...

41:17.517 --> 41:20.034
that money is just
to step foot on the ground.

41:20.068 --> 41:22.275
Mentally, it's, uh...

41:24.310 --> 41:25.793
...a challenge.

41:25.827 --> 41:29.000
Like I have to start making
the big decisions in spending
the big money.

41:31.827 --> 41:33.310
<i>Yeah, time's ticking away.</i>
