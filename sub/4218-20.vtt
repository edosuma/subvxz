WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.044
Present arms!

00:05.756 --> 00:07.256
Previously on
Chicago Fire...

00:11.095 --> 00:13.054
Could this be
Voight-related?
Voight?

00:13.222 --> 00:15.348
When it comes
to gang violence,
the man has a long reach.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.433
I'm gonna push
to fast-track
Peter Mills to Squad.

00:18.811 --> 00:19.977
Sounds like
you guys have all
the answers.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.563
This is Tara Little.
She's a candidate.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.191
She's gonna be riding
along with you guys for
the next few shifts.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.818
Who asked who out?
I'm just curious.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.945
Wait, you did, right?
What?

00:29.113 --> 00:30.530
Yeah, you asked me to
dinner that one night.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.031
Oh, no,
that wasn't a date.

00:35.661 --> 00:36.828
Come on!

00:37.287 --> 00:39.497
Kelly, I wanna know
if you'd like to
have a baby with me.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.083
I'm in.

00:43.669 --> 00:46.045
That you don't have
enough sack to admit
you're sleeping with Heather.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.046
I'm done explaining myself.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.298
You haven't explained
a damn thing!

00:49.466 --> 00:50.550
'Cause you're wrong!

01:04.648 --> 01:07.608
Hey.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.485
So, we're off
and running.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.612
We're what?

01:11.780 --> 01:13.865
I went to the doctor's
office this morning,
got my hormone shot.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.408
Oh. Yeah.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.326
Yeah.
How you feeling?

01:17.828 --> 01:19.287
Fine. Yeah.

01:19.455 --> 01:20.663
It's not affecting
me at all.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.707
It just, uh,
it means the, uh,

01:22.875 --> 01:24.625
window for ovulation
is gonna be in
the next couple of days,

01:24.793 --> 01:25.752
so don't make any plans.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.045
And, um,
as soon as these

01:28.213 --> 01:29.881
say that
I'm good to go,

01:30.048 --> 01:31.674
we've got to
get to the clinic

01:31.842 --> 01:33.760
and perform our
respective duties.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.388
Oh, okay, yeah.

01:37.556 --> 01:40.391
Well...
Sorry, I'm just...
I'm really excited.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.560
I can see that.
Yeah.

01:43.187 --> 01:44.395
All right.

01:46.148 --> 01:47.064
Hey.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.232
Hmm?

01:48.984 --> 01:50.318
I am, too.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.577
Oh! Oh, yeah!
Pecan caramel popcorn!

01:59.745 --> 02:01.412
Let's get
into this before
Herrmann finds out.

02:01.580 --> 02:02.914
Herrmann's gone hunting
with his brother.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.124
It's all the pecan
caramel popcorn
you can eat.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.667
All right!
Sweet!

02:06.835 --> 02:07.752
Who brought
this in?

02:07.920 --> 02:08.628
Uh, the paramedic
candidate

02:08.796 --> 02:09.712
who's riding with
Dawson and Shay.

02:09.880 --> 02:10.922
Oh, yeah, Tara?

02:11.089 --> 02:13.549
Uh, apparently
she spent a couple
of shifts over at 95.

02:13.717 --> 02:16.219
Bob MacElroy, uh,
said she's pretty cool.

02:16.386 --> 02:17.678
What, are you
stalking her now?

02:17.846 --> 02:19.055
No, I'm not stalking her.

02:19.223 --> 02:20.640
I just like knowing
who I'm working with.

02:20.808 --> 02:21.849
Are you
wearing cologne?

02:22.309 --> 02:23.559
No.

02:24.937 --> 02:25.895
Body spray, maybe.

02:27.856 --> 02:28.981
Hey, Tara!

02:29.149 --> 02:30.149
Hey.

02:31.902 --> 02:34.445
Uh, Severide,
I think Capp's
looking for you.

02:34.613 --> 02:35.863
Nah, I just left him.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.698
Hi, everybody.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.367
Hi.
Hey!

02:39.535 --> 02:41.452
Did you bring
this popcorn?
'Cause it's amazing.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.955
I am not above
buying people's
affection.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.542
So, um,

02:48.168 --> 02:50.962
I hear that
you are quite
a graphic designer.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.631
So is anyone
with a laptop.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.259
Yeah, I wish
I'd figured
that out before

02:56.426 --> 02:59.804
I racked up $60,000
in student loans.
Uh-huh.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.681
What made you want
to be an E.M.T?

03:01.849 --> 03:04.225
Uh, my roommate's
a paramedic at 35.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.143
I didn't have to
hang out with her
very long

03:06.311 --> 03:08.187
before I realized
the firehouse
is where it's at.

03:11.358 --> 03:14.277
Engine 51,
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61...

03:14.444 --> 03:15.611
Here we go.

03:15.779 --> 03:18.114
...industrial accident,
Racine and 15th Street.

03:26.999 --> 03:27.915
Hey, what happened?

03:28.083 --> 03:29.750
Uh, worker backed
a forklift into
the shelves

03:29.918 --> 03:31.878
and the whole thing
came down on top
of him.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.880
Don't move
the palettes.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.385
Give him a hand
with that.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.220
Here,
watch your back.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.472
Hang in there, buddy.
We're going to
get you out.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.141
Coming to you.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.102
Hey, can you
tell me your name?

03:48.687 --> 03:50.980
Phil...
Phil Manfreddi.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.941
Okay. Hi, Phil.

03:56.862 --> 03:57.862
Okay, Phil,

03:58.030 --> 04:00.156
I want you to
breathe slow and easy
for me, okay?

04:00.949 --> 04:03.284
See his nail beds?
How blue they are?
What's that mean?

04:03.994 --> 04:05.328
Shock. He's in shock.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.622
Very good. We're going
to keep his C-spine
nice and straight,

04:07.789 --> 04:08.748
and we need
to warm him up.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.666
Okay, I'm going
to lift your head, hon.

04:10.834 --> 04:11.918
Let's get the spreaders.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.003
Forget the spreaders.
Get the torch in here.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.171
We need to cut
this beam.

04:15.339 --> 04:16.422
Copy that.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.799
Wait, why don't we
try and lift it?

04:18.967 --> 04:20.301
It's too unstable.
Anything shifts,

04:20.469 --> 04:22.261
it'll all fall right
back on top of him.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.348
Hey, is there anything
flammable in these boxes?

04:25.515 --> 04:26.557
No, sir.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.017
Need water over here.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.628
Severide!
Kill the torch!

04:56.088 --> 04:57.004
What?

04:57.172 --> 04:59.840
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Look out! Everybody down!

05:18.860 --> 05:21.153
Is it out?
Can't tell. I need
to get in there.

05:25.534 --> 05:26.784
Still smoldering.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.495
This could go up
again any second.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.705
You've got to
move him.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.206
I didn't make it
through the beam.

05:32.374 --> 05:33.624
Wait!

05:34.751 --> 05:36.210
Wait, how about this?

05:39.464 --> 05:40.923
It's worth a try.
Hadley!

05:41.341 --> 05:42.633
Yeah.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.311
Focus on his face
and keep him calm.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.147
All right.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.482
You're going
to be okay, Phil.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.112
Quick thinking,
Candidate.

06:06.658 --> 06:07.908
Gear's all
picked up, Lieutenant.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.077
All right, let's get
back home.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.121
Where's Mills?

06:17.252 --> 06:18.252
Leave his ass.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.046
You got it.

06:21.423 --> 06:22.590
So then, what's the
difference between

06:22.758 --> 06:25.051
an oxy/acetylene torch
and an exothermic torch?

06:25.218 --> 06:26.802
For starters,
an exothermic
will cut through

06:26.970 --> 06:29.680
a solid block
of concrete.
Cool.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.974
Yeah. Here, let me
show you what
else we use.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.115
He'll get over it.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.222
Your lieutenant says
the bathroom needs
a good cleaning, Candidate.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.525
Hey. Kelly, right?

07:22.692 --> 07:24.693
Yeah.
We have
a mutual friend.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.278
Jennifer Robinson?

07:26.446 --> 07:28.656
She tends bar
at Cubby Bear?

07:28.824 --> 07:30.116
Oh.
She said
to say "hello."

07:30.283 --> 07:31.659
Okay, yeah.
Tell her
I said "hello."

07:31.827 --> 07:33.160
Will do.

07:33.328 --> 07:36.413
It's nice to have
a connection with
someone here.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.332
Yeah, it's a great
group at 51.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.084
I'm sure that
you'll fit right in.

07:40.544 --> 07:41.836
Shay and Dawson
taking good care
of you?

07:42.003 --> 07:42.962
Yeah.

07:43.130 --> 07:46.090
I actually have some
copies to go make
for Dawson right now.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.384
So, I'll see you later.

07:48.552 --> 07:49.635
Sure.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.724
Hey, Otis,
check this out.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.478
My grandparents,
in Madrid.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.064
My grandfather
proposed to her there.
Hmm.

08:03.525 --> 08:06.527
You will never see
Russian grandparents
smiling like that.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.196
That place they're
standing in front of

08:09.364 --> 08:11.240
is one of the oldest
restaurants in Europe.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.492
You been?
No. Someday.

08:15.078 --> 08:18.289
I think Molly's
needs a big wooden
door like this.

08:18.456 --> 08:19.665
Something timeless
and beautiful.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.751
How did I know
there was an agenda
attached to this story?

08:22.919 --> 08:24.170
It is a nice door.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.423
Look, Dawson,
now is not the time
to be making

08:27.591 --> 08:29.300
design decisions,
okay?

08:29.467 --> 08:32.511
Herrmann's unreachable
in the woods of
Ontario somewhere.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.513
Yeah, exactly why
now is the time.

08:34.681 --> 08:35.890
Well, we don't
have any money left.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.641
There's a salvage
place I use,

08:37.809 --> 08:40.352
has all kinds of
old structural pieces.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.813
Might take some searching,
but we could take a look.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.565
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.861
Yeah? All right.
Yeah, sounds good.
Thanks.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.114
Bathrooms are done,
Lieutenant.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.160
Showers need
a good cleaning, too.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.497
Okay.

09:02.792 --> 09:06.212
Uh, can I
talk with you for
a minute first?

09:06.630 --> 09:07.963
In private?

09:08.423 --> 09:09.590
Sure.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.728
I wanted to apologize
for this morning.

09:23.605 --> 09:26.482
I know I screwed up,
and it won't happen again.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.443
But I also want
to formally let
you know that

09:29.611 --> 09:33.572
I will be pursuing
that open opportunity
at Squad.

09:34.449 --> 09:35.616
I heard.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.702
But right now,
you are on truck.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.958
And while you're here,
you better act like it.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.587
Yes, sir.

09:52.050 --> 09:56.637
Ambulance 61,
laceration injury,
670 North Talman Avenue.

10:03.853 --> 10:04.979
So sorry about this.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.397
My husband, Dennis,

10:06.564 --> 10:07.481
he was working
on the garage door

10:07.649 --> 10:09.275
and it just
started opening.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.585
His arm is caught in there.
We're not equipped
for this. Call it in.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.254
Dispatch,
this is Ambulance 61.

10:30.422 --> 10:33.132
We need a truck
company to 670
North Talman Avenue.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.425
My shoulder...

10:34.592 --> 10:36.719
I heard the muscle
make a ripping sound.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.934
Okay, we're going
to get you down, Dennis.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.437
Let me support
your weight, okay?

10:46.604 --> 10:47.771
Tara, take hold
of his legs with me.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.356
We're going
to lift him up.

10:49.524 --> 10:50.566
Tara.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.192
I need your help.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.002
Dawson, see if you
can lift the door.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.634
Tara, get up here
and help me.

11:18.803 --> 11:19.887
Lift this, come on.

11:21.556 --> 11:22.556
Dennis,

11:23.266 --> 11:25.642
this is going to hurt
like hell, but it's going
to be quick. All right?

11:25.810 --> 11:26.935
Tell me,
what are you gonna do?

11:30.732 --> 11:31.857
All right.
Get me down.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.700
Arelene, my arm!

11:41.868 --> 11:43.410
Sweetie,
you're all right.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.747
- All right, come on.
- You can come with us.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.379
Where'd Tara go?
Is she off crying
in a corner somewhere?

11:53.546 --> 11:55.089
Oh, come on,
that was pretty gnarly.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.548
Cut her some slack.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.425
So you and Casey
are going, uh,

11:58.593 --> 11:59.760
treasure hunting
after shift, huh?

11:59.928 --> 12:01.595
Don't even start that.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.931
I got to say, though,
it's just nice to be
back to normal with him.

12:04.099 --> 12:05.224
Normal?

12:05.392 --> 12:08.143
Normal as in buried
romantic feelings

12:08.311 --> 12:10.771
and unspoken
sexual tension?

12:11.189 --> 12:12.981
Hey, I ran into Mike,

12:13.149 --> 12:15.567
and he says Hallie,
she's long gone,
she's history.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.236
She's off
"finding herself,"

12:17.404 --> 12:18.695
doing some
medical aid work

12:18.863 --> 12:20.531
in South America
or somewhere...

12:20.698 --> 12:22.950
I don't care, Shay.
I got my man, all right?

12:23.535 --> 12:25.994
Hey, hey, excuse me!
Don't touch that.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.663
That's not yours!

12:28.832 --> 12:29.790
Put it back.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.880
How long ago since
that hormone shot?

12:37.048 --> 12:38.507
Just don't mess
with my gurney.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.885
Grabbed a couple
coffees for you guys.

12:42.053 --> 12:43.595
Thank you.
Thanks.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.639
I, uh, saw the doctor
in the hall.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.766
She said you saved
that man's arm.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.810
Well, we got
him here fast.
That's the key.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.061
Yeah.

12:51.229 --> 12:52.771
Quick response
is everything.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.064
Okay.
Okay?

12:54.232 --> 12:55.441
Mmm-hmm.

13:01.990 --> 13:02.948
Mills.

13:04.075 --> 13:05.993
Yeah, Lieutenant?
Come here.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.374
Have a seat.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.965
Pretty good article
on the different types
of cutting torches

13:20.133 --> 13:22.009
and what situations
they're best for.

13:22.844 --> 13:25.262
Cool.
Thanks, Lieutenant.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.014
How are the
classes going?

13:28.016 --> 13:29.808
Good. Really good,
actually.

13:30.226 --> 13:33.395
I couldn't get
into Vertical Rescue
this time around,

13:33.563 --> 13:35.189
so, it's full up.

13:36.858 --> 13:38.275
What are you doing?
You can't stop it.

13:38.902 --> 13:40.319
Where's the defense
in this game?

13:40.487 --> 13:41.987
There is no defense
in paper football.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.780
I get a penalty kick.
Put up your uprights.

13:44.407 --> 13:45.908
Ah!

13:48.620 --> 13:49.745
Can someone
please explain to me

13:49.913 --> 13:52.414
why our Truck
candidate is sitting
at the Squad table?

13:53.041 --> 13:53.832
Does Severide know?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.167
Severide's there!

13:55.335 --> 13:57.878
They're all there.
It's a little tea party,

13:58.046 --> 14:00.047
and Peter Mills
is the guest of honor.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.175
Call Lieutenant Brunson,

14:03.343 --> 14:05.010
tell him I want
you in his class.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.681
Great, I will.
Good.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.395
I guess we're
not good enough
for him anymore.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.147
What a slap
in the face.

14:17.315 --> 14:20.400
Mills could use
a lecture on
company loyalty.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.569
I've been here,
what, five years?

14:22.737 --> 14:24.071
Nobody ever
talked about

14:24.239 --> 14:25.822
grooming me
for Rescue Squad.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.075
But Mills, oh, Mills...

14:28.243 --> 14:30.035
Maybe that's because
he's busting his ass.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.712
Bet you a dollar
you miss that.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.214
Make it a beer.

14:42.924 --> 14:44.007
You're on.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.929
Gee, I guess
I owe you a beer.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.560
Chief, you got a sec?

14:55.228 --> 14:56.311
Yeah.

15:03.570 --> 15:07.281
This business about
getting Mills on Squad...

15:08.157 --> 15:09.449
You sure he's ready?

15:11.244 --> 15:12.703
Severide thinks so.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.831
Yeah, I'm sure he does.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.792
Have you talked
to Mills about it?

15:18.960 --> 15:20.127
Yeah, I have.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.629
A real conversation,

15:22.797 --> 15:24.298
or just long enough

15:24.465 --> 15:26.717
for him to say
what you wanted
to hear?

15:29.137 --> 15:31.763
Look, Casey,
I get it.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.974
You're tired of
sniffing out talent

15:34.142 --> 15:36.893
and training them up,
only to have them
poached by Squad.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.770
This isn't
about me, Chief.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.940
And it shouldn't be
about you, either,

15:42.942 --> 15:46.028
or your feelings
of obligation toward
Henry Mills.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.201
Your concerns

15:57.206 --> 15:58.832
are duly noted.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.762
Yeah, no,
I know I missed
a couple sessions,

16:11.929 --> 16:14.806
but, uh, Lieutenant Severide,
he really wants me
to take this class,

16:14.974 --> 16:17.934
so I'm hoping
that there's still
time to jump in.

16:19.562 --> 16:20.687
Yeah.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.856
Oh, that's great.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.733
Great. I'll wait
to hear from you.

16:24.901 --> 16:25.734
Okay.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.403
Hey, what are
you doing here?

16:28.571 --> 16:31.156
Uh, taking care
of some business.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.161
Okay.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.124
I feel like I'm doing
something wrong.

16:45.922 --> 16:46.588
I...

16:46.756 --> 16:48.840
I see the way that
people are looking at me,

16:49.008 --> 16:51.551
and I can just imagine
what they're saying
behind my back.

16:59.894 --> 17:02.104
Ambition makes
people uncomfortable.

17:02.855 --> 17:03.772
You just have
to remind yourself

17:03.940 --> 17:06.108
that you're not
doing it for them.

17:08.653 --> 17:09.653
Yeah, well,
I think it's something

17:09.821 --> 17:12.197
a little deeper, though,
with Casey, isn't it?

17:15.785 --> 17:17.536
What do you mean?

17:19.080 --> 17:20.664
You think he'd be
riding me this hard

17:20.832 --> 17:22.582
if I wasn't with
the girl that he likes?

17:26.963 --> 17:28.588
You don't know
what you're talking
about, Pete.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.006
You messed up,

17:30.174 --> 17:31.633
Casey rapped your
knuckles for it.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.719
You know how
many times Otis
had to mop this house

17:33.886 --> 17:35.721
top to bottom
when he was
a candidate?

17:35.888 --> 17:49.317
Uh-huh.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.466
Cindy!
Hi, Leslie.

18:12.884 --> 18:14.718
How're you feeling?
Fat.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.431
Oh, Christopher
left a set of
car keys here,

18:19.599 --> 18:21.433
I just need
to grab them.
Okay.

18:21.601 --> 18:22.976
Did he, uh,
call you yet to brag

18:23.144 --> 18:24.603
about how many
innocent birds
he's killed?

18:24.771 --> 18:27.063
No,
they're deep in
the woods up there

18:27.231 --> 18:29.274
so I don't expect
to hear from him.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.861
Mmm, well, I'm sure
we'll all get an
earful when he's back.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.533
You okay?

18:38.993 --> 18:42.162
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
I just got real winded
walking in here.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.581
That's what I get
for gaining 25 pounds

18:44.749 --> 18:46.374
in the first
two trimesters.

18:54.050 --> 18:56.259
When did the,
uh, shortness
of breath start?

18:56.427 --> 18:59.262
Uh, I guess
it got tricky
about an hour ago.

19:00.056 --> 19:03.141
I should sit
a few minutes, maybe.
Mmm-hmm. Yup.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.685
All right, well,
just to be safe,

19:05.853 --> 19:08.230
I'm gonna go
ahead and take
your vitals, okay?

19:09.023 --> 19:10.106
Oh, it's probably nothing.

19:10.525 --> 19:11.525
Yeah.

19:15.029 --> 19:17.030
Everything look okay?
Yeah. Yeah,
everything's all right,

19:17.198 --> 19:18.615
but I just
want to get you
to Lakeshore

19:18.783 --> 19:20.116
and have a few things
checked out. Okay?
Okay.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.493
So just stay here,

19:21.661 --> 19:24.538
take nice, easy breaths,
and I'm gonna go tell
Chief Boden, okay?

19:24.705 --> 19:25.956
Okay.
Okay.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.548
Chief, Cindy's oxygen
levels are way too low.
It could be a P.E.

19:34.715 --> 19:35.966
We need to get her
to Lakeshore, now.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.384
Go. Go!

19:42.807 --> 19:44.474
All right, Cindy,
nice, easy breaths.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.601
In and out,
you just relax.

19:50.398 --> 19:51.773
Dawson, she's lost
consciousness.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.859
Call ahead to Lakeshore,
give them the report.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.026
I've got to tube her.

19:55.862 --> 19:56.862
You need my help?

19:58.447 --> 20:00.156
No, just get us there
as fast as possible.

20:01.409 --> 20:02.784
Give me
the intubation kit.

20:03.578 --> 20:04.911
Tara!
Okay.

20:06.956 --> 20:07.956
Come on!

20:09.166 --> 20:10.166
Hurry up!

20:12.962 --> 20:14.337
Hand me the 71/2.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.093
Ambu bag.

20:20.761 --> 20:21.887
Come on, Cindy.

20:27.977 --> 20:30.145
Thirty-eight-year-old female,
26 weeks gestation.

20:30.313 --> 20:33.064
She went unresponsive,
stopped breathing,
and I had to intubate.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.400
She's a friend,
wife of one
of our guys.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.110
Sounds like a P.E.

20:37.278 --> 20:39.404
Let's push T.P.A.
And tell the C.T. Scanner
we're coming.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.740
Right away.
We've got her.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.455
She shouldn't be
here alone.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.124
You should
go with her.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.211
You sure?

20:56.464 --> 20:57.672
100%.

20:58.758 --> 20:59.758
Thanks.

21:13.064 --> 21:14.356
Hey, how is she?

21:14.523 --> 21:15.857
The clot traveled
to her lungs.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.984
We did a thrombectomy
and fished it out.

21:18.986 --> 21:19.986
And how's the baby?

21:20.154 --> 21:21.655
The baby is fine.

21:21.822 --> 21:22.989
We're starting her
on blood thinners,

21:23.157 --> 21:25.075
so she'll be on bed rest
for the remainder
of the pregnancy.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.910
But other than that,
she's fine.

21:28.245 --> 21:28.954
Okay.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.705
You can go in
and see her.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.415
Thank you.

21:44.804 --> 21:45.845
Hey, girl.

21:47.181 --> 21:48.348
Get over here.

21:54.897 --> 21:56.314
I'm so glad
you're okay.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.153
Thank you, Leslie.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.489
Of course.

22:20.381 --> 22:21.881
You and Mouch get
a hold of Herrmann?

22:22.049 --> 22:24.509
Yeah, uh,
park rangers
tracked him down.

22:24.677 --> 22:25.677
He's on his
way home now.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.430
Great news
about Cindy.

22:29.056 --> 22:29.931
Thanks to Shay.

22:37.148 --> 22:38.189
Uh-oh.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.692
What'd I do now?
Morning, Dawson.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.777
Hey, Chief Hatcher.

22:42.945 --> 22:44.904
I came by to see
how Tara Little
is doing on the rig.

22:45.865 --> 22:46.906
Uh...

22:47.908 --> 22:50.869
Yeah, she's a nice girl.
Putting in a real effort.

22:52.621 --> 22:53.788
Dawson,

22:54.665 --> 22:55.915
the one thing
I know I can
rely on with you

22:56.083 --> 22:57.834
is the straight story,

22:58.002 --> 22:59.753
and that's what
I'm looking for
here now.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.842
She's not cut out
for a busy house, Chief.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.552
She's game, and has
a positive attitude,

23:07.720 --> 23:09.387
but she just
doesn't have
the stomach for it.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.307
Sounds like
city work's not for her.

23:13.434 --> 23:14.434
Maybe the suburbs.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.103
Thanks, Dawson.

23:18.022 --> 23:19.189
No problem.

23:22.860 --> 23:23.985
Been nice...

23:24.612 --> 23:26.571
Not seeing any
violations with
your name lately.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.073
Keep it up.

23:32.536 --> 23:36.289
I love how solid
all this old
construction stuff is.

23:36.457 --> 23:37.749
Houses were
built to last.

23:40.753 --> 23:41.920
Cool. Let me
check it out.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.129
It's pretty heavy.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.548
I'm sorry,
are you saying
I can't manage?

23:45.716 --> 23:47.967
Ooh, look at
that game face.

23:48.469 --> 23:50.345
Give it to me.
All right.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.180
I got it.

23:53.182 --> 23:54.390
It's fine.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.976
It's not that bad.
Yeah, you look
like you got it.

23:57.728 --> 23:58.978
Okay. No, take it.

23:59.146 --> 24:00.480
Yeah? Sure?
Take it. Take it.

24:05.778 --> 24:06.778
Doors.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.542
Oh, Casey.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.255
Ooh.

24:27.174 --> 24:28.174
This is it.

24:28.342 --> 24:29.968
Yeah, we can
strip it down,

24:30.136 --> 24:31.928
stain it a dark
mahogany or something.

24:32.096 --> 24:34.764
Yeah. It's perfect.

24:35.516 --> 24:36.975
If my mom
sees this hanging
up at Molly's,

24:37.143 --> 24:39.185
she is going
to go nuts.

24:46.193 --> 24:47.402
Let me get this...

24:51.574 --> 24:52.866
- Hey.
- Hey there.

24:53.033 --> 24:55.827
Uh, look, I'm going
to have to blow off
dinner tonight.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.787
Yeah, they're letting me
jump into this Vertical
Rescue class,

24:57.955 --> 24:59.455
and I just can't.
Oh, yeah.
No worries.

24:59.623 --> 25:02.041
Um, we can...
We can do it
tomorrow night.

25:02.585 --> 25:04.919
Okay.
Where you at?

25:06.881 --> 25:09.716
Um, I'm looking at
doors for the bar.

25:09.884 --> 25:10.884
By yourself?

25:11.385 --> 25:13.678
You wanna
wait until tomorrow?
I can help you.

25:14.722 --> 25:16.097
Um, no. I'm good.
Thanks.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.433
Talk to you later.
Okay.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.109
I always hold up
my end of a bet.

25:29.236 --> 25:32.113
Uh, very
honorable of you.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.783
Am I interrupting
something?

25:36.535 --> 25:37.869
Uh, not really.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.037
Um...

25:40.331 --> 25:41.331
Come on in.

25:46.212 --> 25:49.464
It was kind of a rough
time when I started
my E.M.T. Certification.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.884
My family thought
I was crazy,

25:53.052 --> 25:54.761
shifting gears
from design.

25:56.180 --> 25:57.513
They support you now?

25:57.681 --> 25:58.806
Not really.

26:00.142 --> 26:01.226
But they will,

26:01.393 --> 26:03.394
as soon as
I show them
I can hack it.

26:07.524 --> 26:10.360
I could tell that
you didn't really
remember Jennifer,

26:10.527 --> 26:12.195
the bartender
I asked you about.

26:12.363 --> 26:14.072
No, I do,
the blonde.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.990
Black hair. Black.

26:16.158 --> 26:18.159
Oh.
Nice try.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.537
She remembered you.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.666
When I told her
I was gonna be
working at 51,

26:24.833 --> 26:26.209
she warned me
about you.

26:27.044 --> 26:29.087
She said that you
were just my type,

26:30.339 --> 26:32.548
that I'd have
a hard time
staying away.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.301
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.388
She's a smart girl,
that Jen.

26:38.973 --> 26:41.599
What the hell, Kelly?

26:43.227 --> 26:44.185
What's wrong?

26:44.353 --> 26:46.646
What's wrong?
I called you,
like, 10 times.

26:48.565 --> 26:50.650
I must have left
my phone at the gym.

26:50.818 --> 26:52.777
I told you
to be on alert!
I'm in the window!

26:52.945 --> 26:54.988
I...
Now the clinics closed!

27:03.038 --> 27:04.205
Unbelievable.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.374
Unbelievable!

27:06.542 --> 27:08.793
Hey! I'm sorry.
Hey, listen, Shay!

27:08.961 --> 27:10.086
I'm sorry, okay?

27:10.254 --> 27:11.754
We can go
to the clinic
tomorrow morning.

27:11.922 --> 27:12.714
That's still
in the window,
isn't it?

27:12.881 --> 27:15.049
No, there's no way
to be sure about that!

27:17.469 --> 27:19.762
I got to ask,
is this you talking
or is this the...

27:19.930 --> 27:22.307
Don't blame this
on the hormones!

27:22.474 --> 27:25.143
You can't even bother
to look your phone.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.395
You can't even
think to look at it?

27:27.563 --> 27:28.896
I didn't have it!

27:29.773 --> 27:31.983
A baby isn't
an afterthought, Kelly.

27:32.568 --> 27:33.693
I know that.

27:34.111 --> 27:35.278
Do you?

27:43.537 --> 27:47.081
So I release you
of the obligation.

27:58.552 --> 28:00.011
Okay, save some
for the lady.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.305
Why?
She tanked Tara.

28:03.599 --> 28:06.309
You tanked the single,
attractive E.M.T.

28:06.477 --> 28:08.770
I didn't tank her,
Otis.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.773
I just said she wasn't
cut out for the streets
of Chicago, okay?

28:11.940 --> 28:13.900
They'll probably
move her to Mayberry
or something.

28:14.068 --> 28:17.403
Wrong.
Her probationary status
was revoked, Dawson.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.203
Hey, did you
show Otis?

28:25.621 --> 28:28.414
Uh, no, not yet.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.292
Show me what?
The new door
for the bar.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.586
Oh, Dawson,
I was happy with
the one we had.

28:33.754 --> 28:34.712
Don't worry about it.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.005
I know the guy
who runs the place.

28:36.423 --> 28:39.342
Dawson has
expensive tastes, granted,

28:39.510 --> 28:41.219
but I managed to
talk him down.

28:47.101 --> 28:50.978
Engine 51,
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.398
House fire.
4800 block West Thomas.

28:53.941 --> 28:57.151
Oh, look, guys,
Mills is going
to ride with us.

29:06.203 --> 29:07.954
Severide,
get that gate down.

29:10.124 --> 29:12.375
Hadley,
grab the k12.
Got it.

29:13.043 --> 29:14.544
The windows are all
covered up, Chief.

29:14.711 --> 29:15.920
I can't get
a look inside.

29:17.714 --> 29:20.049
Not seeing
a lot of signs of
occupancy here.

29:28.976 --> 29:29.809
Smell a little
skunky to you?

29:29.977 --> 29:30.977
Yep.

29:36.400 --> 29:39.026
Patched into the city
service just below
the weather head.

29:39.194 --> 29:40.611
They're stealing
electricity.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.072
Looks like
we got a marijuana
grow house, Chief.

29:44.074 --> 29:45.867
Give me a small
primary search team,

29:46.034 --> 29:47.493
and be careful in there.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.036
Power's disconnected.

29:49.997 --> 29:52.206
Bring Mills in.
Teach him how to
breach a grow house.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.584
You mind if I run
my own company?

29:57.463 --> 29:59.172
All right, Mills,
pay attention.

30:03.093 --> 30:04.093
Wow.

30:05.888 --> 30:07.472
Watch out
for booby traps.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.932
Don't get tangled up
in wires or duct work,

30:10.100 --> 30:11.893
and keep an eye out
for chemicals or fuel.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.644
Copy that, Lieutenant.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.572
- Fire department!
- Call out!

30:24.740 --> 30:26.032
Anybody here?

30:30.621 --> 30:32.246
Capp, pick him up.

30:33.081 --> 30:34.165
You got it.

30:48.931 --> 30:49.972
Pass him to me.

30:53.560 --> 30:54.769
Watch the glass.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.871
What was that?
Sounded like electricity.

31:15.249 --> 31:16.916
Get him on the gurney.

31:18.168 --> 31:19.418
Okay, we got him.

31:19.586 --> 31:21.879
Where's Capp?
Right behind me.

31:28.929 --> 31:30.304
Capp!
Hey, hey, hey!

31:30.472 --> 31:31.430
Chief!
Take it easy.

31:31.598 --> 31:32.974
We've already got
two men inside.

31:35.519 --> 31:37.937
Casey, you got
eyes on Capp?

31:38.105 --> 31:39.146
Not yet.

31:41.525 --> 31:42.817
Capp, call out!

31:43.652 --> 31:44.902
Capp,
where are you?

31:49.032 --> 31:51.033
Chief, the electricity
is still on.

31:51.910 --> 31:52.952
Come on.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.038
We're looking
for a secondary
line now. Hang on.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.334
- There. Right there.
- Yeah.

32:04.381 --> 32:06.048
Capp, call out!

32:15.559 --> 32:16.559
Capp?

32:18.729 --> 32:19.770
Talk to me, Casey.

32:19.938 --> 32:20.896
He's caught up
in some wires.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.898
I can't tell if
they're energized.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.901
Don't touch him!
Stay back.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.742
Casey, the secondary
line is cut.

32:32.909 --> 32:34.327
We're still looking
for other lines.

32:34.494 --> 32:35.995
Can't wait.

32:36.496 --> 32:37.830
Stand back, Mills.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.393
Hey, Casey,
do you hear me?

33:09.112 --> 33:10.112
Get in there!

33:10.864 --> 33:11.864
Help him!

33:13.617 --> 33:14.992
I can't tell
if he's breathing.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.252
Hey.

33:27.464 --> 33:28.631
How you
feeling, Capp?

33:31.760 --> 33:33.636
Smells like
a Phish concert
out here.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.934
We'll take him in
to get checked out.
Okay.

33:40.102 --> 33:41.560
Come on. Get up.

33:43.397 --> 33:44.647
I got him.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.110
Rescuing Rescue Squad.

33:49.820 --> 33:51.195
Nicely done, Mills.

34:08.296 --> 34:10.548
Not gonna
miss your ride
this time, huh?

34:14.136 --> 34:15.177
Lieutenant,

34:16.680 --> 34:18.264
how come you never
went for Squad?

34:24.896 --> 34:26.105
Mills,

34:28.358 --> 34:31.318
all the lives we save,
the people we help,

34:33.029 --> 34:35.990
you think they give
a damn which company
insignia we wear?

34:42.164 --> 34:43.748
Truck 81,
are you available

34:43.915 --> 34:46.000
to assist in a
shooting incident?

34:46.168 --> 34:47.585
Truck 81 responding.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.044
We gotta go.

35:08.190 --> 35:10.983
No rush, ladies.
He's not going anywhere.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.654
Territorial dispute.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.199
A couple of
corner boys ran up
and shot him.

35:19.409 --> 35:21.076
Same old story.

35:21.244 --> 35:23.037
How do I
know this guy?

35:27.876 --> 35:29.126
Curtis.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.546
This the guy
who helped Antonio
bust Voight.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.060
Hey, we're too late.

35:47.813 --> 35:50.272
Okay. How's Capp?

35:51.441 --> 35:52.775
He's good, he's good.

35:52.943 --> 35:55.236
No electrical
burns or anything.
They gave him an E.K.G.

36:06.623 --> 36:08.207
Yeah. I know.

36:16.299 --> 36:17.591
So, what does
this mean?

36:17.759 --> 36:19.009
According to Boden,

36:19.177 --> 36:23.639
the DA's office remains
committed to its case
against Detective Voight.

36:24.307 --> 36:28.394
And, after all, Curtis
testimony wasn't the only
arrow in their quiver.

36:28.562 --> 36:29.937
Is that what
you're hearing, Casey?

36:31.481 --> 36:32.982
I thought we were
here to celebrate.

36:33.149 --> 36:35.693
Exactly!
Come on, guys!

36:35.861 --> 36:38.863
It's time for the
inaugural round of
beers at Molly's.

36:39.739 --> 36:41.115
- Hey, Casey.
- Hey, Shay.

36:41.283 --> 36:43.450
Hey.
Hey, how's
Cindy doing?

36:43.618 --> 36:44.618
She's good.

36:44.786 --> 36:47.121
Herrmann's back,
glued to her side,
which is driving her crazy.

36:47.289 --> 36:49.540
All right guys.
Belly up. Come on.

36:52.460 --> 36:53.836
Oh, wait.
Wait, wait.

36:55.005 --> 36:56.338
What do you think?

36:56.506 --> 36:57.798
Hey.
To Molly's.

36:57.966 --> 37:00.009
To Molly's.

37:03.805 --> 37:04.972
- Mmm...
- It's delicious, Otis.

37:06.308 --> 37:08.893
But are you
gonna chill it
before opening?

37:09.394 --> 37:11.437
I swear
I plugged that in.

37:11.855 --> 37:13.439
Okay, who wants
to see this door?

37:13.607 --> 37:14.899
Me!

37:17.819 --> 37:18.694
Hey, can I
talk to you?

37:18.862 --> 37:20.070
Yeah. Uh...

37:24.910 --> 37:26.243
Listen, about
the other day...
I'm so sorry. I...

37:26.411 --> 37:27.745
About the other day,
listen, I messed up.

37:27.913 --> 37:28.954
Big time.
I know that.

37:29.789 --> 37:31.874
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

37:32.042 --> 37:34.376
I mean, it was
the hormones, I think.

37:34.544 --> 37:37.671
I'm not sure.
But, look, I...

37:38.214 --> 37:39.840
I think I should make
other arrangements,

37:40.008 --> 37:41.592
because, it's like,

37:41.760 --> 37:43.844
our friendship
is one of the only
really good things

37:44.012 --> 37:45.137
I have going on
in my life,

37:45.305 --> 37:46.889
and I don't want
to mess that up.

37:47.474 --> 37:49.725
That's the
silliest thing
I've ever heard.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.895
Kelly...
You're trying to give
me an easy out, I get it.

37:53.063 --> 37:55.606
I do. But I don't
need one, okay?

37:59.027 --> 38:00.194
We're doing this.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.074
Okay?
Okay.

38:05.533 --> 38:06.867
Come here.

38:13.917 --> 38:16.752
I have to admit
it looks pretty
damn good.

38:16.920 --> 38:17.836
Right?

38:18.004 --> 38:19.463
And hey, can you...
I need a picture.

38:19.631 --> 38:20.798
Okay.

38:25.845 --> 38:27.805
Come here.
All right.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.892
I hope this
comes out okay.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.186
I don't have
my glasses.
Just give me this.

38:34.771 --> 38:36.563
All right, guys.

38:36.731 --> 38:37.773
Oh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

38:37.941 --> 38:39.650
Whoa!
Whoa, sorry.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.360
Come on, come on!
We're trying to take
a picture.

38:41.528 --> 38:43.320
Looks great.
Sorry. Sorry.

38:43.488 --> 38:44.488
All right, guys...

38:47.784 --> 38:49.118
Ready?

38:49.285 --> 38:50.411
One more.

38:51.371 --> 38:52.871
Hey, Pete.

38:54.958 --> 38:56.667
Hi. I thought
you had classes
all day.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.752
Oh, I do.
Just wanted to carve out
a couple minutes

38:58.920 --> 39:00.713
to come see
this door.
Looks great.

39:07.929 --> 39:09.972
Ah, I got
to go to
the firehouse.

39:11.975 --> 39:13.058
What for?

39:13.727 --> 39:16.270
I don't know.
See you guys.
See you.

39:34.164 --> 39:35.164
Hey, Tara.

39:41.963 --> 39:43.047
Okay.

39:54.309 --> 39:55.309
Chief?

39:55.477 --> 39:56.977
Come on in, Kelly.
Take a seat.

40:05.153 --> 40:06.862
Lieutenant Severide,

40:09.699 --> 40:10.866
a subordinate
has accused you

40:11.034 --> 40:13.118
of luring her
to your apartment

40:14.829 --> 40:16.830
and trying to force
yourself upon her.

40:16.998 --> 40:17.998
What?

40:18.166 --> 40:19.666
She hasn't pressed
criminal charges as yet,

40:19.834 --> 40:20.709
and we're trying
to convince her

40:20.877 --> 40:22.419
to keep this
an internal matter.

40:24.005 --> 40:25.964
Are you talking
about Tara Little?

40:26.132 --> 40:27.216
What did she
say I did?

40:27.634 --> 40:29.927
You're gonna
want to talk to
your union rep.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.055
See about
getting a lawyer.

40:46.069 --> 40:48.070
I really
appreciate this, Casey.

40:49.405 --> 40:50.823
It means a lot.

40:51.783 --> 40:52.950
I know.

40:54.911 --> 40:56.578
That's why I did it.

41:03.253 --> 41:06.588
Seems like things
are going pretty well
with you and Mills.

41:11.886 --> 41:14.054
Yeah. They are.

41:16.224 --> 41:17.808
He's a lucky guy.

41:24.607 --> 41:26.024
Uh, sorry,
we're closed.

41:31.364 --> 41:32.364
Hallie?

41:32.532 --> 41:33.574
Hey, Matt.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.951
What?

41:40.331 --> 41:42.374
I thought you were
in South America.

41:42.876 --> 41:44.418
I was.
I just got back.

41:44.586 --> 41:46.545
The guys at
the station said
you might be here.

41:48.548 --> 41:50.048
Hey, Gabby,
how are you?

41:50.216 --> 41:53.010
I'm good. I'm good.
You look...
You look great.

41:53.678 --> 41:54.761
Thanks.

41:55.471 --> 41:58.682
Uh, you wanna
