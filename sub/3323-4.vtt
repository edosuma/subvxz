He was. Now he's barely even human.

Six years ago, my sister and l were
at school. Our house caught fire.

Eleven people were trapped inside.

37:26.704 --> 37:28.365
He was the only survivor.

37:30.708 --> 37:34.371
So what makes you so sure
that they set the fire?

'Cause they're the only ones
that knew about us.

They say they'll only kill an adult
and only with absolute proof.

But there were people in my family
that were perfectly ordinary in that fire.

It had width and power.
