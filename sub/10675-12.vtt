00:00.421 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:08.969 --> 00:11.132
OK, the timer is set.

00:11.132 --> 00:14.725
Nothing better than pranking
new victims on Halloween.

00:16.097 --> 00:17.898
This is perfect.

00:17.898 --> 00:19.810
Bree just did her hair,

00:19.810 --> 00:21.402
and Chase has
no sense of humor.

00:21.402 --> 00:22.693
What could possibly
go wrong?

00:24.695 --> 00:27.698
They have no idea
what's about to hit them.

00:32.653 --> 00:34.155
So are we just gonna
pretend that we don't notice

00:34.155 --> 00:36.497
Kaz and Oliver plotting
something over there?

00:36.497 --> 00:38.249
It's easier that way.

00:38.249 --> 00:41.252
I'm not getting involved
until something explodes.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.925
Hey, Skylar,

00:44.925 --> 00:46.547
I just wanted to remind you

00:46.547 --> 00:49.090
about my standing offer
for one romantic dinner,

00:49.090 --> 00:51.762
and that offer also applies
to romantic lunch,

00:51.762 --> 00:54.805
breakfast, smoothie,
and other select
thick beverages.

00:56.477 --> 00:58.849
Sure.
How about dinner tonight?

00:58.849 --> 01:00.141
I get it.
You're busy.

01:00.141 --> 01:01.312
I totally understand.

01:02.773 --> 01:04.945
Wait!
Did you just say yes?

01:06.777 --> 01:09.190
Oliver, you can't
do dinner tonight.

01:09.190 --> 01:10.821
We have plans.

01:11.952 --> 01:13.824
Annual Halloween pranks?

01:13.824 --> 01:16.036
We've been doing
them together
since we were eight?

01:16.036 --> 01:18.199
New victims?

01:18.199 --> 01:19.660
I'm so sorry.

01:19.660 --> 01:21.582
I totally forgot
that it was Halloween.

01:21.582 --> 01:22.833
We can do dinner tomorrow.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.835
No! No, no, no!
You already said yes!

01:24.835 --> 01:26.547
You can't take it back!
We're doing this!

01:29.009 --> 01:30.341
She said yes!

01:30.341 --> 01:32.012
All right! All right!

01:32.012 --> 01:33.134
( timer ticking )
Where do I begin?

01:40.431 --> 01:42.933
Hey, I still have
a date with Skylar.

01:42.933 --> 01:46.317
Not even a nose full
of pumpkin can change that.

01:48.028 --> 01:50.321
( theme music playing )

02:34.275 --> 02:35.906
Chase, help!

02:35.906 --> 02:37.448
I was flying
around the city

02:37.448 --> 02:40.040
and I clipped
a radio tower!

02:40.040 --> 02:41.872
You'll be fine.

02:43.784 --> 02:45.956
Oh, come on.
What gave it away?

02:45.956 --> 02:48.789
Rubber arm, fake blood,

02:48.789 --> 02:50.671
and you have
two left hands.

02:52.633 --> 02:56.006
Ugh. Without Oliver,
all my pranks are lame.

02:56.006 --> 02:59.009
His recipe
for fake blood is amazing,

02:59.009 --> 03:01.852
second only to his oozing
"marshmallow pus."

03:01.852 --> 03:03.724
( chuckles )

03:03.724 --> 03:07.898
You two have
a very odd relationship.

03:07.898 --> 03:11.071
Hey. Hey, you're smart.

03:11.071 --> 03:13.574
You want to help me
pull off some pranks?

03:13.574 --> 03:15.155
I got my sights set
on Bree.

03:15.155 --> 03:18.739
I'm thinking something
in the realm of corn.

03:18.739 --> 03:21.872
As fun as that sounds,

03:21.872 --> 03:23.664
and it doesn't,

03:23.664 --> 03:26.166
I got a lot of work to do.

03:26.166 --> 03:28.669
You remember when Roman
and Riker blasted
out our widows?

03:28.669 --> 03:30.090
Of course I remember.

03:30.090 --> 03:31.462
The glass got everywhere.

03:31.462 --> 03:34.755
I had to throw out
a whole bowl of salsa.

03:34.755 --> 03:37.508
Well, I was able
to extract their DNA

03:37.508 --> 03:39.600
from the flash drive
they left behind.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.513
If I can isolate
the components of their
shape-shifting power,

03:42.513 --> 03:45.516
I can replicate it
and figure out a way
to stop them from using it.

03:45.516 --> 03:47.728
Then we'll finally get rid
of the biggest threat

03:47.728 --> 03:50.481
to superheroes
this world has ever known.

03:50.481 --> 03:53.854
Mmm!
But it's Halloween!

03:58.659 --> 04:02.162
Aah!

04:03.574 --> 04:05.125
What's goin' on, Perry?

04:05.125 --> 04:06.206
It's Halloween!

04:06.206 --> 04:08.419
That means
it's my turn to die!

04:10.170 --> 04:11.792
You may recall

04:11.792 --> 04:13.253
that I was a child actor

04:13.253 --> 04:16.587
on the hit TV show
The Little Squirts.

04:16.587 --> 04:18.589
Nope.

04:18.589 --> 04:19.880
Well, I was.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.091
Here, I'll show you.

04:27.057 --> 04:29.940
The series was canceled
after a horrible accident

04:29.940 --> 04:32.353
killed an actor
on Halloween night.

04:32.353 --> 04:33.524
Yeah, I really don't--

04:33.524 --> 04:35.526
Every year since,

04:35.526 --> 04:38.028
one more member
of the cast and crew

04:38.028 --> 04:39.990
had met an untimely fate
on Halloween

04:39.990 --> 04:43.163
in ways that directly
relate to the show.

04:43.163 --> 04:44.575
Again, Perry,
I'm really not interest--

04:44.575 --> 04:47.167
We once did an episode
with a butcher,

04:47.167 --> 04:50.621
and ten years later, bam,
my co-star Cindy McDoogal

04:50.621 --> 04:52.373
choked on a flank steak!

04:55.005 --> 04:56.256
Tonight I realized,

04:56.256 --> 04:58.419
I'm the last
living cast member.

04:58.419 --> 05:01.592
I'm the last Squirt.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.725
Death is coming for me.

05:04.725 --> 05:07.428
I have to be ready
for anything.

05:07.428 --> 05:09.099
Well, I hope
you're ready for this,

05:09.099 --> 05:10.190
because I'm kicking
you out.

05:10.190 --> 05:11.482
No!

05:11.482 --> 05:13.233
No, you can't!

05:13.233 --> 05:15.025
Perry, relax, OK?

05:15.025 --> 05:16.487
You're not gonna die.

05:16.487 --> 05:18.148
I'm sure it's
just a coincidence

05:18.148 --> 05:21.281
that 34 of your co-workers
suffered horrible deaths

05:21.281 --> 05:23.113
on the same day every year.

05:24.905 --> 05:28.208
Yeah, you might be
in trouble.

05:28.208 --> 05:30.000
Which is why
you're gonna protect me.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.582
I'm not leaving your side
until this thing's over!

05:31.582 --> 05:34.004
Whoa, OK.
Run that by me again?

05:34.004 --> 05:36.667
I have to wait until midnight
until I'm in the clear,

05:36.667 --> 05:38.509
then I can go get candy!

05:39.510 --> 05:41.802
Come on.
It'll be fun.

05:41.802 --> 05:46.056
Bree and Perry,
hangin' out all night,

05:46.056 --> 05:48.729
doin'
middle-age lady stuff.

05:48.729 --> 05:51.311
Uh, I'm 17.

05:51.311 --> 05:53.233
Really? Yikes!

05:53.233 --> 05:55.275
Time has not been
kind to you.

05:59.279 --> 06:01.281
I'm sorry I'm so nervous.

06:01.281 --> 06:04.655
It's just whenever
you look at me
with those beautiful eyes,

06:04.655 --> 06:07.988
I... get all emotional.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.372
I agree, Skylar.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.796
I am the most handsome man
in Centium City.

06:17.297 --> 06:20.170
Oh, wait, you got
a little something on your...

06:20.170 --> 06:22.503
Oh, my.

06:22.503 --> 06:24.555
It's really happening,
isn't it?

06:26.306 --> 06:27.307
Hey, Oliver.

06:27.307 --> 06:29.810
Uh! This isn't
what it look--

06:29.810 --> 06:31.351
I was just--

06:31.351 --> 06:33.393
OK, you need to knock.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.186
What is all this?

06:36.186 --> 06:37.518
I'm just doing
a practice dinner

06:37.518 --> 06:39.229
to make sure everything
goes smoothly tonight,

06:39.229 --> 06:42.653
and good news,
so far, you love everything.

06:48.118 --> 06:50.741
OK, Perry,
you seriously need to stop!

06:50.741 --> 06:52.913
You follow me
every time I take a step.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.495
Then take less steps.

06:55.536 --> 06:57.798
Aah! Popcorn!

06:57.798 --> 06:59.339
Oh, relax.

06:59.339 --> 07:01.251
It is obviously
just one of Kaz's lame pranks.

07:01.251 --> 07:02.543
You can see his shoes
sticking out.

07:05.045 --> 07:06.256
Ohh.

07:08.348 --> 07:11.261
Worst Halloween ever.

07:15.265 --> 07:18.358
Hey, could one of you
drizzle some butter on me?

07:32.573 --> 07:33.954
Hey, Chase.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.165
You want to help me
for a second?

07:35.165 --> 07:36.416
Real busy here, Kaz.

07:36.416 --> 07:37.958
I don't have time
for pranks.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.289
Oh, this isn't a prank.

07:39.289 --> 07:40.841
I'm actually stuck.

07:42.673 --> 07:44.294
Hold on.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.218
Yeah. Ow! Ow!

07:48.218 --> 07:50.300
Ow!

07:50.300 --> 07:53.053
( groaning )

07:53.053 --> 07:56.226
Just get-- Oh, you're
going over the head.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.267
That makes more sense.

07:59.940 --> 08:01.191
Pfft!

08:05.485 --> 08:08.198
Oh! Thanks.

08:08.198 --> 08:09.199
Mm-hmm.

08:09.199 --> 08:11.491
Man, I can't prank you,

08:11.491 --> 08:13.243
I can't prank Bree.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.285
The only ones left
are Oliver and Skylar,

08:15.285 --> 08:16.827
but they know
all my tricks.

08:16.827 --> 08:19.209
Halloween is ruined.

08:19.209 --> 08:22.082
Well, you can stay
down here with me.

08:22.082 --> 08:24.885
( laughs )
I'm not that desperate.

08:27.217 --> 08:29.840
How's your, uh,
shape-shifty
science thing going?

08:29.840 --> 08:33.013
Great. I was able
to successfully replicate

08:33.013 --> 08:35.055
Roman and Riker's powers
into a serum.

08:35.055 --> 08:36.226
Oh, so it's ready?

08:36.226 --> 08:38.098
Yeah, I think so.

08:38.098 --> 08:39.940
I'm just gonna go
dig up some earthworms
to try it on.

08:39.940 --> 08:41.311
I'll be right back.

08:44.905 --> 08:46.446
Who needs earthworms

08:46.446 --> 08:49.109
when you got this squirmy
little guy right here?

08:51.742 --> 08:53.283
( coughs )

08:53.283 --> 08:55.285
I'm sensing that's
supposed to be injected,

08:55.285 --> 08:57.117
not swallowed.

09:01.251 --> 09:03.584
Dinner was delicious,
Oliver.

09:03.584 --> 09:06.587
This is going much better
than I expected.

09:06.587 --> 09:09.299
Although I'm not sure
why she's here.

09:12.222 --> 09:13.674
Well, she was already
wearing the dress,

09:13.674 --> 09:15.475
so I figured I'd
invite her to dinner.

09:15.475 --> 09:17.598
You're cute.

09:20.100 --> 09:21.772
( wind gusting )

09:23.523 --> 09:25.445
It's Roman and Riker!

09:25.445 --> 09:27.277
OK, I know
they're supervillains,

09:27.277 --> 09:29.069
but even for them,
this is cruel.

09:30.861 --> 09:32.282
KAZ: Ow!

09:38.078 --> 09:39.499
Kaz?
Kaz?

09:39.499 --> 09:41.541
Ha!

09:41.541 --> 09:44.374
Oh, you should have
seen the look on your faces!

09:44.374 --> 09:46.336
Even the mannequin jumped!

09:47.798 --> 09:50.340
Chase made
a shape-shifting serum.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.672
So all you have to do

09:51.672 --> 09:53.674
is think about what form
you want to change into.

09:53.674 --> 09:54.675
Check it out.

09:57.517 --> 10:01.141
Hi. I'm Bree.
I smell like flowers.

10:03.353 --> 10:04.985
Hi. I'm Perry,

10:04.985 --> 10:07.728
and I definitely
don't smell like flowers.

10:11.782 --> 10:13.493
OK, big deal.

10:13.493 --> 10:15.365
Mr. Davenport's
cybercloaks
do the same thing.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.367
No, this is way better.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.369
I can turn into anything,
not just people.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.540
Watch.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.505
( bleating )

10:25.505 --> 10:28.418
Kaz, you're a sheep.

10:29.509 --> 10:32.302
Still less creepy
than your mannequin friend.

10:34.174 --> 10:36.056
OK, fun's over.

10:36.056 --> 10:38.348
Switch back so Skylar
and I can finish dinner.

10:38.348 --> 10:41.061
Now, I can't
remember how long we
were holding hands for,

10:41.061 --> 10:43.643
so we should probably
just start that part over.

10:47.357 --> 10:51.862
Well, I can see
your evening is going
as well as expected.

10:54.364 --> 10:55.696
Has anyone seen Kaz?

10:55.696 --> 10:57.778
I'm missing a vial
of my shape-shifting serum.

10:57.778 --> 10:59.199
That's 'cause he drank it.

10:59.199 --> 11:01.371
He's right there.
( bleats )

11:01.371 --> 11:04.244
What? He changed
into a sheep?!

11:04.244 --> 11:05.375
No!

11:05.375 --> 11:06.837
No, no,
no, no, no, no no!

11:06.837 --> 11:08.418
Why? What's wrong?

11:08.418 --> 11:11.501
When Roman and Riker
shape-shift supernaturally,

11:11.501 --> 11:13.593
they still think
like Roman and Riker,

11:13.593 --> 11:15.555
but when Kaz changed
into a sheep,

11:15.555 --> 11:18.258
he took on the mental
capacity of a sheep!

11:18.258 --> 11:21.561
And a sheep has
a very small mental capacity!

11:21.561 --> 11:23.563
Less than Kaz?

11:23.563 --> 11:25.395
That seems unlikely.

11:27.067 --> 11:28.398
Well,
just change him back.

11:28.398 --> 11:29.980
I can't.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.982
I haven't figured out
how to do that yet.

11:31.982 --> 11:37.237
Wait. You mean Kaz could
be stuck like this forever?

11:37.237 --> 11:41.621
Well, no, not forever.

11:41.621 --> 11:43.744
Sheep have
a very short lifespan.

11:52.793 --> 11:54.544
Okay, we have to find a way

11:54.544 --> 11:56.797
to turn Sheep Kaz
back into Kaz.

11:56.797 --> 12:00.390
Do we have to right now?
He's really cute!

12:02.803 --> 12:04.264
I got it!

12:04.264 --> 12:06.056
I'll--I'll show him
a picture of real Kaz.

12:06.056 --> 12:08.899
Maybe that will jog
his little sheep memory.

12:10.650 --> 12:12.652
Hey, buddy,
this is you.

12:12.652 --> 12:14.354
No, pay no attention
to the sweater.

12:14.354 --> 12:15.445
It's not wool, it's, uh--

12:15.445 --> 12:17.317
It's-- it's polyester.

12:17.317 --> 12:18.779
( bleating )

12:22.702 --> 12:24.244
Okay, it's not working.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.665
Why won't he turn back?

12:25.665 --> 12:28.078
I don't know. Let's go
down to Mission Command

12:28.078 --> 12:29.790
and try to find a way
to reverse the serum.

12:29.790 --> 12:32.292
'Kay. Kaz...

12:32.292 --> 12:34.004
stay.

12:39.139 --> 12:41.301
And when Tilly Dobson
fell off that ladder,

12:41.301 --> 12:42.432
down the mountain,

12:42.432 --> 12:43.844
and right
onto that chainsaw,

12:43.844 --> 12:45.145
I knew I was next.

12:46.686 --> 12:48.228
( gasps )
A sheep!

12:48.228 --> 12:50.851
This is it!
This is how I'm gonna die!

12:50.851 --> 12:53.063
Okay, that is ridiculous.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.985
Can I explain why there
is a sheep in the living room?

12:54.985 --> 12:56.316
No, I-I can't.

12:56.316 --> 12:58.819
But... it's probably
just another one

12:58.819 --> 13:00.200
of Kaz's stupid pranks.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.112
It does not mean
it's here to kill you.

13:02.112 --> 13:03.904
Just get rid of it
before I do!

13:03.904 --> 13:05.615
Okay. Fine.

13:06.496 --> 13:08.408
You poor thing.

13:08.408 --> 13:10.911
Come on, let's take you
someplace safe before
Kaz gets back.

13:14.544 --> 13:17.297
Okay, this new serum
should turn Sheep Kaz

13:17.297 --> 13:18.508
back into Kaz-Kaz.

13:20.510 --> 13:22.973
Kaz, you shapeshifted
into Perry!

13:22.973 --> 13:25.475
Oliver, you shapeshifted
into an idiot!

13:26.726 --> 13:29.519
( laughing )
Nope, that's all Perry.

13:30.520 --> 13:31.771
I have a question:

13:31.771 --> 13:33.984
What happened to the sheep
that was here?

13:33.984 --> 13:35.105
Oh, that?

13:35.105 --> 13:36.606
Yeah, it was here
to kill me,

13:36.606 --> 13:38.738
so Bree took it to someplace
it'd be appreciated.

13:38.738 --> 13:40.901
I'm guessing
a slaughterhouse.

13:42.112 --> 13:43.743
What?!

13:43.743 --> 13:44.784
Oh, no.

13:44.784 --> 13:46.947
I'd better call her.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.122
Wow.

13:52.122 --> 13:53.663
Nothing says Halloween

13:53.663 --> 13:55.715
like a bunch of
smelly farm animals.

13:56.877 --> 13:57.878
Hup.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.301
Hey, Chase, what's up?

14:01.301 --> 14:02.883
Bree, where are you?

14:02.883 --> 14:05.265
I am at the petting zoo.

14:05.265 --> 14:08.468
Whatever you do,
do not give away that sheep.

14:08.468 --> 14:10.020
( chuckles )
Too late! I just swapped it

14:10.020 --> 14:12.272
for 20 bucks
and a coupon for a hayride.

14:13.563 --> 14:17.687
Well, you'd better get it back,
because that sheep is Kaz!

14:17.687 --> 14:18.818
What?

14:18.818 --> 14:20.440
Ew, seriously?

14:20.440 --> 14:21.982
I let him
lick my hand.

14:23.613 --> 14:24.864
Okay,
just hold on.

14:24.864 --> 14:28.368
Hi, um, if I ask
for my sheep back,

14:28.368 --> 14:30.080
do I still get
the hayride?

14:33.994 --> 14:36.256
Okay, Bree's bringing
the sheep back here.

14:36.256 --> 14:38.378
That thing
is coming back here?

14:38.378 --> 14:41.171
Well, I'm gonna barricade
myself in Mission Command.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.552
I'll be safe there.

14:42.552 --> 14:43.763
No one on my TV show
ever died

14:43.763 --> 14:45.265
in a high-tech
control center.

14:45.265 --> 14:48.428
Wait-- library,
movie theater,
bowling alley.

14:48.428 --> 14:49.679
Nope! I'm good!

14:52.272 --> 14:54.394
And now she's gone.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.775
Win-win.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.943
Kaz, there you are.

15:02.943 --> 15:05.485
You okay?
He-- he looks pale to me.

15:05.485 --> 15:07.027
Does he look pale
to you?

15:08.118 --> 15:09.699
He's a sheep.

15:10.830 --> 15:12.702
Are you sure we can't
keep him this way?

15:12.702 --> 15:15.705
I mean, until we can all
at least get a nice
sweater out of him?

15:17.837 --> 15:19.419
Okay.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.251
There we go.

15:22.542 --> 15:24.754
All right, so,
if the serum works,

15:24.754 --> 15:27.047
then Sheep Kaz
should become...

15:32.642 --> 15:35.475
Then Sheep Kaz
should become...!

15:38.518 --> 15:40.860
Then Sheep Kaz
should become...!

15:40.860 --> 15:41.901
( bleating )

15:44.324 --> 15:46.736
Yay! We might all get
sweaters after all!

15:46.736 --> 15:47.777
Whoo!

15:52.122 --> 15:54.204
Perry, are you down here?

15:54.204 --> 15:55.535
Over here!

15:59.539 --> 16:01.631
I'm freaking out.
It's almost midnight,

16:01.631 --> 16:04.134
so whatever's gonna happen
is gonna happen soon.

16:04.134 --> 16:06.636
This is the only thing
I could find to protect me.

16:06.636 --> 16:09.219
Uh, there's a whole room
of weapons and artillery,

16:09.219 --> 16:10.510
but, okay.

16:12.092 --> 16:13.393
Hey, you know what?

16:13.393 --> 16:15.595
How 'bout I make you
a nice cup of tea

16:15.595 --> 16:17.307
to calm you down, okay?

16:17.307 --> 16:19.689
Tea? Are you
trying to kill me?

16:19.689 --> 16:21.731
My co-star,
Phillip Damasio,

16:21.731 --> 16:23.693
died when he drank
from a pot of tea

16:23.693 --> 16:25.865
while the water
was still boiling.

16:25.865 --> 16:27.987
His insides melted!

16:29.529 --> 16:31.321
I heard the only thing left

16:31.321 --> 16:33.783
was his signature
handlebar mustache,

16:33.783 --> 16:36.706
floating in a puddle
of chamomile.

16:38.538 --> 16:41.581
Handlebar mustache?

16:41.581 --> 16:43.833
I'll be right back.

16:45.585 --> 16:47.887
( panting and chuckling )

16:47.887 --> 16:49.389
Who's this guy?

16:49.389 --> 16:51.761
Uh, it's-- it's
Phillip Damasio.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.683
He's-- he's alive and well

16:53.683 --> 16:55.395
and working at
the Centium City petting zoo.

16:55.395 --> 16:56.686
What a coincidence!

16:56.686 --> 16:59.729
Here's 20 bucks.
Just go with it.

16:59.729 --> 17:01.521
Is it really you,
Philly D?

17:01.521 --> 17:03.733
Oh, yes, it is. See?

17:03.733 --> 17:05.275
Right age, right look,

17:05.275 --> 17:07.277
little handlebar mustache.

17:09.489 --> 17:12.242
Wait. So you went
from being a child star

17:12.242 --> 17:14.614
to working in a petting zoo?

17:14.614 --> 17:16.286
You're living the dream!

17:18.618 --> 17:19.959
Hey, look, look!

17:19.959 --> 17:21.751
I-it's 12:01, see?

17:21.751 --> 17:23.623
You made it!
You're alive!

17:23.623 --> 17:27.167
That means you and I are
the last two living squirts.

17:28.758 --> 17:30.130
It must be fate.

17:30.130 --> 17:31.971
Let's go grab
a late-night dinner.

17:31.971 --> 17:35.555
Maybe we can rekindle
our onscreen romance.

17:38.348 --> 17:39.769
Just-- here's 20 more.

17:40.850 --> 17:43.443
I'm waiting!

17:43.443 --> 17:44.984
All right,
just take it all!

17:44.984 --> 17:46.986
Here. Just go. Go!

17:50.490 --> 17:52.902
I can't believe
my serum didn't work.

17:52.902 --> 17:54.954
This is awful.

17:54.954 --> 17:56.956
Kaz cannot be a sheep
for the rest of his life.

17:56.956 --> 17:59.459
He owes me ten bucks!

17:59.459 --> 18:00.830
Wait.

18:00.830 --> 18:01.961
When I zapped the swarm

18:01.961 --> 18:03.963
thinking it was Roman
and Riker,

18:03.963 --> 18:06.256
it changed Kaz
back into his normal self.

18:06.256 --> 18:08.878
Maybe if I zap Sheep Kaz,
it'll do the same thing.

18:08.878 --> 18:11.921
That could work.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:11.921 --> 18:14.053
What if it doesn't?
It could kill him?

18:14.053 --> 18:15.635
That is true.

18:15.635 --> 18:17.927
Plus, the whole place
would smell like burnt wool.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.681
It's our only option,
Oliver.

18:22.772 --> 18:23.723
But...

18:27.687 --> 18:28.938
Fine.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.651
Hold on.

18:32.862 --> 18:35.325
Just in case
it doesn't work out,

18:35.325 --> 18:37.737
I have a few things
I want to say to Kaz first.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.454
Could you give us some space?

18:47.747 --> 18:49.249
Hey, buddy,

18:49.249 --> 18:51.341
I'm sorry I wasn't there
for you on Halloween.

18:51.341 --> 18:53.713
I should have rescheduled
my date with Skylar.

18:53.713 --> 18:56.256
I mean, she and I are
going to be together for
the rest of our lives,

18:56.256 --> 18:58.848
so we'll have plenty of time
for dinner later.

18:59.929 --> 19:01.261
Run that by me again?

19:03.933 --> 19:05.895
No matter what happens now,

19:05.895 --> 19:07.937
you'll always be
my best friend.

19:09.319 --> 19:11.150
But you do still
owe me ten bucks.

19:12.942 --> 19:13.943
I love you, man.

19:17.197 --> 19:18.948
Don't get emotional, Kaz,

19:18.948 --> 19:20.950
you're gonna make me cry.

19:22.332 --> 19:24.334
Um... Oliver?

19:24.334 --> 19:26.586
Kaz.

19:27.707 --> 19:29.128
Kaz, you're not a sheep.

19:31.381 --> 19:33.132
How is this possible?

19:33.132 --> 19:36.846
Well, the serum wore off
while a 6-year-old
was petting me.

19:42.392 --> 19:44.514
Well, don't stop.

19:47.106 --> 19:49.108
Yeah, that kid's gonna be
scarred for life.

19:51.521 --> 19:53.943
Bree must have grabbed
the wrong sheep.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.985
I-I'm sorry I ruined
your guys' night.

19:55.985 --> 19:57.487
You didn't.

19:57.487 --> 20:00.119
Really?
Really?

20:00.119 --> 20:02.372
Yeah. I mean,
at least it was interesting.

20:02.372 --> 20:03.913
I was afraid you were
gonna end it

20:03.913 --> 20:05.915
with some cheesy
fireworks or something.

20:05.915 --> 20:07.587
( scoffing )

20:07.587 --> 20:09.329
( clears throat )

20:09.329 --> 20:10.960
Oliver to base:
Cancel the show.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.333
I repeat, cancel the show.

20:23.102 --> 20:24.724
What's up, Kaz?

20:24.724 --> 20:27.607
I just took the other sheep
back to the petting zoo,

20:27.607 --> 20:30.560
and I'm pretty sure Perry
has a new boyfriend.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.482
Yeah, some guy with
a handlebar mustache.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.564
I saw them tandem-riding
a donkey.

20:36.486 --> 20:37.987
Ugh.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.279
What are you up to?

20:39.279 --> 20:40.950
Oh, I just got rid
of my research.

20:40.950 --> 20:42.862
I can't crack shapeshifting.

20:42.862 --> 20:44.954
No matter what I did,
my scientific methods

20:44.954 --> 20:46.576
only worked temporarily.

20:46.576 --> 20:48.127
Which is a good thing for you,

20:48.127 --> 20:51.170
or else you'd still be
munching on hay right now.

20:51.170 --> 20:53.172
It's not that bad.

20:53.172 --> 20:54.544
It's all you can eat.

20:56.085 --> 20:59.549
Well, I guess Roman
and Riker's powers
are still a mystery,

20:59.549 --> 21:01.761
so we're pretty much
right back to where
we started.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.183
Hey, don't sound
so disappointed.

21:04.183 --> 21:07.807
I'm back to normal,
although my feet
are killing me.

21:13.102 --> 21:14.153
Oliver!

21:14.153 --> 21:16.946
Get down here!
Kaz is still part sheep!

21:20.199 --> 21:21.611
OLIVER'S VOICE:
Hey, what's up, guys?

21:21.611 --> 21:24.203
Oh, no! I just
threw away all my research!

21:25.955 --> 21:28.538
( shrieks )

21:29.829 --> 21:32.542
Oh, it's good to have
you back, buddy!

21:32.542 --> 21:33.753
( chuckles )
