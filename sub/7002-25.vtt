WEBVTT

00:02.969 --> 00:05.670
A good spring tune-up.
Right, al?

00:05.671 --> 00:07.471
That's right,
but before we go,

00:07.473 --> 00:10.008
We'd like to
make an announcement I'm sure
you all have been waiting for.

00:10.009 --> 00:12.677
Al is a woman
trapped in a man's body.

00:15.815 --> 00:19.217
No. I'm sure our audience
knows that's not true.

00:19.218 --> 00:21.285
I'm just kidding, al.

00:21.286 --> 00:23.788
We invited our viewers to vote
for their all-time favorite
guest here on <i>tool time,</i>

00:23.789 --> 00:25.657
And today, we'll
announce the winner.

00:25.658 --> 00:28.994
That's right.
You were able to go down
to your local hardware store

00:28.995 --> 00:33.331
And pick up a ballot that
listed every single guest
we've ever had on <i>tool time,</i>

00:33.332 --> 00:37.068
Although bob vila
was left off that list.

00:38.270 --> 00:40.071
Computer error, al.

00:41.674 --> 00:43.975
Anyway, our three finalists
are george foreman,

00:43.976 --> 00:45.710
Mario and michael andretti,

00:45.711 --> 00:48.312
And dwayne from the
k&b construction company.

00:50.215 --> 00:53.685
From our ever-widening audience,
we've had thousands of viewers
write in.

00:53.686 --> 00:56.387
Lisa, what's the final count?
112 postcards, tim.

00:56.388 --> 00:58.256
Thank you, lisa.

00:58.257 --> 01:00.992
And the winner for
the most popular guest
here on <i>tool time</i> is...

01:00.993 --> 01:03.862
<i>(fanfare)</i>

01:03.863 --> 01:05.730
I've got goose bumps,
I really do.

01:07.767 --> 01:09.233
What? No.

01:12.404 --> 01:15.173
Mario
and michael andretti.

01:16.475 --> 01:18.109
<i>(al stutters)</i>

01:18.110 --> 01:20.444
Tim, that's not what...
That's not what it...

01:20.445 --> 01:22.013
That's not what it says.
Yes, it does.

01:22.014 --> 01:23.381
No, it... No, it doesn't.
Yes, it does.

01:23.382 --> 01:25.050
Does not.
Does too.

01:26.652 --> 01:28.720
Bob vila.

01:33.358 --> 01:36.394
It can't... It can't be...
It cannot be bob vila.

01:36.395 --> 01:38.429
It can't be bob vila.
I erased his name...

01:38.430 --> 01:42.266
Computer error
took his name off that list.

01:42.267 --> 01:44.202
Well, maybe the viewers

01:44.203 --> 01:46.437
Did what I did
and wrote his name in.

01:46.438 --> 01:47.505
That's what I did.

01:47.506 --> 01:51.342
Write-ins
weren't allowed, lisa.

01:51.343 --> 01:53.812
Al told me I could.
He did, did he?

01:53.813 --> 01:55.513
Yes, I did.

01:57.149 --> 01:58.817
So please join us next time

01:58.818 --> 02:01.786
When we'll meet
our winning guest - bob vila.

02:01.787 --> 02:05.423
So popular that,
even though he was deliberately
left off the ballot,

02:05.424 --> 02:07.859
Won with a write-in campaign.

02:07.860 --> 02:09.860
So join us next time
on <i>tool time,</i>

02:09.862 --> 02:12.764
When bob and al discuss
how to remove crusty food
from their beards.

02:12.765 --> 02:14.933
See you next time
on <i>tool time.</i>

03:28.373 --> 03:30.408
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

03:33.946 --> 03:37.115
Jill, this is unbelievable.
I've never won anything before.

03:37.116 --> 03:39.217
A day of beauty for two
at adriana's.

03:39.218 --> 03:42.486
It is so great
that it is for two.

03:42.487 --> 03:44.488
Can you imagine a whole day
of being pampered?

03:44.489 --> 03:46.657
What, tim doesn't
pamper you?

03:46.658 --> 03:48.759
Yeah, right.

03:48.760 --> 03:50.995
Tim's idea of pampering me

03:50.996 --> 03:54.032
Is to wear his pants
to breakfast.

03:54.033 --> 03:55.533
<i>(oven timer dings)</i>

03:55.534 --> 03:59.770
Jill, are brad and randy
planning to do some gardening?

03:59.771 --> 04:01.840
Hey! Hey, guys!

04:01.841 --> 04:05.310
Where are you going
with that shovel and that rake?

04:05.311 --> 04:06.377
Nowhere.

04:06.378 --> 04:09.948
Don't go near
the cemetery again.

04:09.949 --> 04:11.515
Cemetery?

04:11.516 --> 04:13.852
Yeah. Last week, they dug a hole
near the cemetery wall

04:13.853 --> 04:17.454
And told mark that
one of the bodies escaped.

04:19.124 --> 04:22.593
We're just
going down to the creek
to build a dam.

04:22.594 --> 04:26.297
Forget the dam, beaver boy.
Lose the shovel. Lose the rake.

04:26.298 --> 04:28.166
Aw, man.

04:28.167 --> 04:31.035
Now, listen, if you guys
get back before karen and I do,
go to wilson's.

04:31.036 --> 04:33.671
Mark's gonna be
over at billy's.

04:33.672 --> 04:36.407
Morning, tim.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:36.408 --> 04:38.709
Aw, it's nice to see
that tim

04:38.710 --> 04:40.745
Is his usual charming,
bubbling self.

04:40.746 --> 04:42.247
Oh, ignore him.

04:42.248 --> 04:45.350
He's always in a snit
when bob vila's on the show.

04:45.351 --> 04:48.386
Isn't he the guy that has
that national tool show
that tim ripped off?

04:48.387 --> 04:50.554
Don't start, karen, please.

04:50.555 --> 04:53.691
All I've heard all week long is,
"bob vila this, bob vila that."

04:53.692 --> 04:56.094
What does bob vila have
that I don't?
High ratings.

04:56.095 --> 04:57.528
Fans.
Big salary.

04:59.131 --> 05:00.531
Are you through?

05:00.532 --> 05:03.601
Oh, pookie.
We're just kidding.

05:03.602 --> 05:07.338
Remember, you have
something to be proud of
that bob vila does not have.

05:07.339 --> 05:09.340
Oh, yeah. What?
Al.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.443
<i>(giggles)</i>

05:12.444 --> 05:14.779
Normally, I would have
seen that coming.

05:14.780 --> 05:17.415
I'm very vulnerable right now.

05:17.416 --> 05:19.117
Tim, you're so tense.

05:19.118 --> 05:21.286
Maybe you should come
and pamper yourself
at adriana's.

05:21.287 --> 05:24.322
Yeah, yeah. They have manicures
and pedicures for men.

05:24.323 --> 05:26.925
Let me tell you two gals
something.

05:26.926 --> 05:28.927
Men don't let other people
touch their feet.

05:28.928 --> 05:30.594
A real man
clips his own toenails

05:30.595 --> 05:32.530
And flicks 'em
in his wife's hair.

05:36.501 --> 05:38.369
Does everybody
know what time it is?

05:38.370 --> 05:40.305
Tool time!

05:40.306 --> 05:42.740
That's right. Binford tools
is proud to present

05:42.741 --> 05:46.010
Tim "the tool man" taylor.

05:50.282 --> 05:52.083
Thank you, lisa.
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

05:52.084 --> 05:54.152
I'm your host
tim "the tool man" taylor.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.454
You all know
my assistant al.

05:56.455 --> 05:58.356
Well, tim,
this is the big day.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.658
It sure is. We get to do
that subfloor. Ooh, yeah.

06:00.659 --> 06:03.261
I don't think that's why
the audience is watching today.

06:03.262 --> 06:05.896
I'm sure that, like me,
they're all excited
about seeing

06:05.897 --> 06:08.799
Our favorite guest
contest winner.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.202
Aren't we all, al.
Aren't we all.

06:11.203 --> 06:14.405
Now, the subfloor
will start...
Tim.

06:14.406 --> 06:17.608
Why don't we introduce
our favorite guest?

06:17.609 --> 06:19.610
Why not? Our favorite guest

06:19.611 --> 06:21.812
Is someone
a few of you may know...

06:21.813 --> 06:24.415
I think we all know bob
and love him.

06:24.416 --> 06:27.452
Are we gonna have to
hose you down, al?

06:27.453 --> 06:28.987
Let me introduce

06:28.988 --> 06:33.024
The paterfamilias
of home repair -
mr. Bob vila.

06:36.428 --> 06:39.230
Thank you. Thanks
for that warm welcome.

06:39.231 --> 06:42.266
Mr. Vila,
I just want you to know
I'm one of your biggest fans.

06:42.267 --> 06:45.503
In my opinion, you've
completely redefined
television home repair.

06:45.504 --> 06:47.138
Lisa.

06:47.139 --> 06:48.606
Right.

06:48.607 --> 06:50.341
Good to have you here
again, bob.
Thanks.

06:50.342 --> 06:51.842
That goes double for me.

06:51.843 --> 06:53.911
Thanks, al.
It's always good to see you.

06:53.912 --> 06:56.914
I was so thrilled
to find out I was picked
your favorite guest here.

06:56.915 --> 06:59.550
Well, I encouraged
a lot of people
to vote for you.

07:01.453 --> 07:03.454
Bob, why don't you
take a seat right here?

07:03.455 --> 07:05.723
Now, a lot of people
think there's a big rivalry
between bob and I,

07:05.724 --> 07:07.625
But, actually, there's
a lot of mutual respect
between us, right, bob?

07:07.626 --> 07:09.827
Absolutely, jim.

07:11.163 --> 07:12.663
It's tim.

07:12.664 --> 07:15.333
I was just pulling
your leg, buddy.
Just kidding.

07:19.905 --> 07:23.307
I don't... I don't know
if we can have bob
on the show anymore.

07:23.308 --> 07:26.744
My... My sides
are about to split.

07:26.745 --> 07:28.979
Al, you've got a wonderful
sense of humor.

07:28.980 --> 07:31.516
Doesn't he, though?

07:31.517 --> 07:33.551
Well, you know,
bob is also here

07:33.552 --> 07:35.920
To promote one of my
favorite charities.

07:35.921 --> 07:39.990
The society for the prevention
of cruelty to flannel.

07:39.991 --> 07:41.725
Actually, tim,
I'm supporting

07:41.726 --> 07:43.928
The metropolitan
detroit children's fund.

07:43.929 --> 07:45.963
I'm just pulling your leg,
actually.

07:45.964 --> 07:48.132
It's a wonderful charity,
and I bet they're excited
that you're their chairperson.

07:48.133 --> 07:50.768
I understand that you're
working on a lawn-mower race.

07:50.769 --> 07:53.771
That's right. And
I'm having a tough time
getting some competition.

07:53.772 --> 07:55.239
Well,
you know, bob,

07:55.240 --> 07:58.576
Tim has
a very powerful
lawn mower.

07:58.577 --> 08:00.578
I tweaked out
my lawn mower at home

08:00.579 --> 08:02.580
And dumped a big motor in it.

08:02.581 --> 08:05.183
Mine isn't homemade.

08:05.184 --> 08:07.718
I actually had mine designed
and built by professionals.

08:07.719 --> 08:09.554
Yeah? Well, I...

08:09.555 --> 08:13.057
I dumped a 300cc harley
with a special cam in it.

08:13.058 --> 08:14.758
That sounds like
the junior model.

08:14.759 --> 08:16.760
Bob here put in a 410.

08:16.761 --> 08:19.230
Good for bob.
Bad for you.

08:19.231 --> 08:20.864
Yeah, and I've got
an elongated throttle.

08:20.865 --> 08:23.634
I've actually been clocked
at 42 miles an hour.

08:23.635 --> 08:25.570
<i>(both)</i> 42?

08:25.571 --> 08:27.638
You have a lawn mower
that goes 42?
Yeah.

08:27.639 --> 08:30.774
Well, bob,
I think it's time
to kick some grass.

08:30.775 --> 08:32.477
What do you say? Are you
up to the challenge?

08:32.477 --> 08:34.111
To... I... You know...

08:34.113 --> 08:36.547
Yeah, why not?
Sure, I'll race you.

08:36.548 --> 08:39.750
Great.
Sure. That'll be good.
A lot of fun.

08:39.751 --> 08:41.085
For charity.

08:41.086 --> 08:43.121
Well, tim,
I just hope

08:43.121 --> 08:45.323
You're not
a poor loser.

08:45.324 --> 08:48.426
Al, I think the audience
knows just what kind
of loser I am.

08:48.427 --> 08:50.294
Experienced.

08:52.631 --> 08:54.765
<i>(jill)</i> tim!
Yeah. Out here.

08:54.766 --> 08:55.699
Timmy!

09:00.005 --> 09:01.972
I thought you guys
were going to that spa.

09:04.543 --> 09:07.278
We've been there
six hours.

09:07.279 --> 09:09.079
You look fabulous.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.948
Thank you.

09:10.949 --> 09:13.050
Come out to the garage.
I wanna show you something.
Time for the unveiling.

09:13.051 --> 09:14.452
Unveiling of what?

09:14.453 --> 09:17.488
What are you up to now?
Prepare to be amazed, girls.

09:20.725 --> 09:22.960
I'm amazed.

09:22.961 --> 09:24.061
You like it?

09:24.062 --> 09:25.896
Like it? I hate it.

09:25.897 --> 09:26.997
What is it?

09:26.998 --> 09:28.699
What is it?

09:28.700 --> 09:32.970
It's a riding lawn mower
with a jet engine
off a chinook helicopter.

09:34.439 --> 09:37.275
Are you out of your mind?

09:37.276 --> 09:40.144
You put a jet engine
on a lawn mower?

09:40.145 --> 09:43.080
No, but thanks
for thinking I could.

09:43.081 --> 09:44.982
I borrowed this.

09:44.983 --> 09:47.017
It's on loan from
the u.S. Lawn mower
racing association.

09:47.018 --> 09:49.086
Why would anyone
do this?

09:49.087 --> 09:50.721
Think about it.

09:50.722 --> 09:52.690
You got riding lawn mower,
you got jet engine.

09:52.691 --> 09:56.594
Sooner or later,
somebody was gonna
put 'em together.

09:56.595 --> 09:59.129
Tell me you're not gonna
race this thing.

09:59.130 --> 10:01.199
Technically,
it won't be a race.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.701
It's just an exhibition
with... Bob vila.

10:03.702 --> 10:06.270
I should have known.
Whenever bob vila's
on the show,

10:06.271 --> 10:08.339
You turn everything
into a competition.

10:08.340 --> 10:09.840
Jill, this is for charity.

10:09.841 --> 10:11.442
No, it's not.
It's to compete.

10:11.443 --> 10:14.445
Honey, this is no competition.
This is gonna be a slaughter.

10:14.446 --> 10:16.480
I'll be at the finish line,

10:16.481 --> 10:19.183
And bob vila will be
back there at the starting post
picking mulch out of his beard.

10:19.184 --> 10:21.519
"see you, bobby."

10:21.520 --> 10:23.454
How fast
does this thing go?

10:23.455 --> 10:26.757
Right now, this gearing,
about 62.

10:26.758 --> 10:30.160
But if I regear it,
94 I'll get out of it.

10:30.161 --> 10:33.664
And after they pry you
out of this with a crowbar,

10:33.665 --> 10:36.534
I'll turn to the crowd
and say,

10:36.535 --> 10:39.837
"he was a nice man, a good man,
but not a bright man."

10:41.206 --> 10:45.776
Honey, this'll
mow a football field
in 11 seconds.

10:50.181 --> 10:51.415
Hi, guys. Where did you go?

10:51.416 --> 10:53.884
We went down to the creek
and caught some tadpoles.

10:53.885 --> 10:55.620
Why didn't you
come and get me?

10:55.621 --> 10:57.955
We looked all over,
and we couldn't find you.

10:57.956 --> 10:59.557
I was in my room.

10:59.558 --> 11:03.227
Boy, brad, the one place
we didn't look.

11:03.228 --> 11:06.063
Why don't you take me
anywhere with you guys?

11:06.064 --> 11:08.266
It's because
you always rat on us.

11:08.267 --> 11:10.200
Promise I won't
rat on you again.

11:10.201 --> 11:11.702
Oh, really?

11:11.703 --> 11:14.305
Hey, brad, maybe we should
make him take the test.

11:14.306 --> 11:16.240
Yeah, the test.

11:16.241 --> 11:17.742
What test?

11:17.743 --> 11:20.010
The tadpole secrecy test.

11:20.011 --> 11:21.646
What's that?

11:21.647 --> 11:25.082
You have to put
a live tadpole
in your mouth.

11:25.083 --> 11:27.217
Ew! No way!

11:27.218 --> 11:29.186
Ok, fine.

11:29.187 --> 11:31.889
But then you don't get to
come to the creek with us
and build a raft.

11:31.890 --> 11:33.457
See ya.

11:33.458 --> 11:35.993
Wait.

11:35.994 --> 11:38.429
How long do I have to
hold it in my mouth?

11:38.430 --> 11:40.264
Three seconds.

11:40.265 --> 11:41.932
Three whole seconds?

11:41.933 --> 11:44.101
I told you
he'd be a chicken.

11:44.102 --> 11:46.203
I'm not chicken.

11:46.204 --> 11:49.039
I'll do it.

11:54.646 --> 11:57.548
Buddy, come here.

11:57.549 --> 12:02.453
Now close your eyes.
Open your mouth.

12:02.454 --> 12:05.456
Ooh, here's a nice slimy one.

12:05.457 --> 12:07.991
You'd better watch out.
He's really wiggly.

12:07.992 --> 12:08.992
Here he comes.

12:08.993 --> 12:11.929
Closer, closer.

12:11.930 --> 12:14.365
One thousand one.

12:14.366 --> 12:16.667
One thousand two.

12:16.668 --> 12:19.169
One thousand three.
You did it.

12:30.382 --> 12:33.217
Mark, you weren't supposed
to swallow the tadpole.

12:33.218 --> 12:35.152
What's gonna happen?

12:35.153 --> 12:38.088
Well, it's gonna swim around
inside you and grow into a frog.

12:38.089 --> 12:39.056
Yeah.

12:41.693 --> 12:42.793
Ribbit-ribbit.

12:42.794 --> 12:44.862
Shut up, brad!

12:44.863 --> 12:47.231
Hey, mark, I wouldn't
drink any water.

12:47.232 --> 12:49.433
Might make it grow faster.

12:49.434 --> 12:51.301
I'm gonna tell
mom and dad on you.

12:51.302 --> 12:56.106
Oh, yeah, like mom and dad
are gonna believe that
we made you eat a tadpole.

12:56.107 --> 12:59.677
Brad... I wouldn't
use that argument.

12:59.678 --> 13:00.944
<i>(mark)</i> mom!

13:03.248 --> 13:05.315
Mom!

13:05.316 --> 13:07.718
Mom!
What is it? What is it?
What's the matter?

13:07.719 --> 13:10.187
Brad and randy
made me eat a tadpole.

13:10.188 --> 13:12.956
A what?
A tadpole.

13:12.957 --> 13:15.526
Where are they?
They ran away.

13:15.527 --> 13:17.628
Well, mark, you're
gonna be fine.

13:17.629 --> 13:19.397
I'll get you
a glass of water.

13:19.398 --> 13:21.932
No! Not water!

13:21.933 --> 13:23.868
Ok.

13:23.869 --> 13:26.236
It's turning into a frog.

13:26.237 --> 13:28.406
No, it isn't, honey.

13:28.407 --> 13:30.941
This thing
can't possibly survive
inside of your stomach.

13:30.942 --> 13:34.779
Look, you're
just gonna digest it
like a piece of fruit.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.881
You sure?
I'm positive.

13:36.882 --> 13:40.217
You're just gonna
poop that thing
right out.

13:40.218 --> 13:45.756
Now just go outside and play.
Listen, eating a tadpole's
no big deal.

13:45.757 --> 13:49.226
Aaargh! Gross!
That is so gross.

13:49.227 --> 13:52.029
Can you imagine having that
slimy thing swimming around
inside your stomach?

13:52.030 --> 13:54.698
I know. Yuck!
I cannot believe
that they did this.

13:54.699 --> 13:57.034
Oh, it's so gross.
What happened?

13:57.035 --> 13:59.603
Brad and randy made
mark eat a tadpole.

13:59.604 --> 14:01.839
<i>(laughs)</i>

14:04.676 --> 14:07.778
This is not funny.
It's a terrible thing to do.

14:07.779 --> 14:10.781
Oh, come on. They're boys.
What's the big deal?

14:10.782 --> 14:13.216
When I was little,
I made one of my brothers
eat spaghetti.

14:13.217 --> 14:16.053
It had an earthworm in it.
Oh, tim, please.

14:16.054 --> 14:18.088
Steve didn't even know
it was in there

14:18.089 --> 14:20.958
Until one of the noodles
tried to crawl back out.

14:20.959 --> 14:23.160
It was great.
Oh, he paid me back.

14:23.161 --> 14:25.429
He made me eat
my mashed potatoes with
a big cockroach in there.

14:25.430 --> 14:27.631
Oh! Tim!

14:27.632 --> 14:30.501
Oh, quit ohhing.
They're good. They're crunchy.
They're not bad.

14:37.342 --> 14:38.976
What's that smell?

14:38.977 --> 14:41.411
It's clam chowder...

14:41.412 --> 14:45.483
Mushrooms, raisin
and little bits of liver.

14:45.484 --> 14:47.084
Ugh!

14:47.085 --> 14:51.622
I want brad and randy
to think it's tadpole soup.

14:51.623 --> 14:54.625
That's disgusting.
I love it.

14:55.694 --> 14:57.528
I'm just going with the flow.

14:57.529 --> 15:00.865
Go out and tell them
that the soup is on.

15:00.866 --> 15:03.801
<i>(sinister laugh)</i>

15:04.903 --> 15:08.205
Brad! Randy!
Hustle up. Dinnertime.

15:08.206 --> 15:09.673
Hi-ho, neighbor.

15:09.674 --> 15:11.909
Hi there, wilson.

15:11.910 --> 15:13.210
You missed a snip.

15:13.211 --> 15:14.411
Mm-hmm.

15:14.412 --> 15:18.749
I bet you can't guess
what I got in my garage.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.551
Well, just off
the top of my head,

15:20.552 --> 15:24.254
I'd say
a small riding lawn mower
with a jet engine attached.

15:24.255 --> 15:25.956
<i>(grunts)</i>

15:25.957 --> 15:28.358
Mark told me.

15:28.359 --> 15:29.960
Think about it, wilson.

15:29.961 --> 15:32.963
I'll be driving the fastest
riding lawn mower on earth.

15:32.964 --> 15:34.765
Uh-huh, uh-huh-huh-huh.

15:34.766 --> 15:38.368
I'm gonna be
a lawn-mowing legend.
Oh-oh-oh.

15:38.369 --> 15:42.907
Well, tim, it sounds to me like
you're dealing with hubris.

15:42.908 --> 15:45.676
Hubris? What's that
in english?

15:45.677 --> 15:49.046
It is english.
It means "excessive pride."

15:49.047 --> 15:52.249
Oh, yeah, I got that.
<i>(grunts)</i>

15:52.250 --> 15:54.284
Not necessarily
a good thing.

15:54.285 --> 15:57.187
I don't have that.
I don't want it.

15:57.188 --> 16:00.824
I'm just in this
lawn-mowing competition
with bob vila.

16:00.825 --> 16:03.126
Mm, nothing like
the rousing spirit
of competition.

16:03.127 --> 16:05.696
Yeah. Jill and karen
think it's a stupid idea.

16:05.697 --> 16:08.966
Well, tim,
competition can be
a very healthy thing.

16:08.967 --> 16:11.101
That's what I think. I think
competition inspires men,

16:11.102 --> 16:14.171
Challenges us to build
the biggest building,
the fastest missile,

16:14.172 --> 16:17.908
The most absorbent
bathroom tissue.
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

16:17.909 --> 16:20.243
Competition brings out
the best in product.

16:20.244 --> 16:21.445
You're darn right.

16:21.446 --> 16:23.948
But sometimes
the worst in men.

16:23.949 --> 16:24.982
<i>(grunts)</i>

16:24.983 --> 16:27.517
Hey, guys. I was
just looking for you.

16:27.518 --> 16:29.987
Hey, dad.

16:29.988 --> 16:31.288
We're really sorry.

16:31.289 --> 16:34.024
Sorry about what?

16:34.025 --> 16:37.027
Didn't you talk to mark?
No.

16:37.028 --> 16:39.429
Oh. Then we're sorry
we're late for dinner.

16:39.430 --> 16:41.431
Well, your mom's
got it ready for you.

16:41.432 --> 16:43.500
Take those muddy shoes off
before you get in the house.

16:43.501 --> 16:44.735
All right.

16:44.736 --> 16:47.237
Tim, would the boys
be in trouble?

16:47.238 --> 16:49.707
Big trouble. They made mark
eat a tadpole,

16:49.708 --> 16:52.943
So jill's making them think
they're having tadpole soup.

16:52.944 --> 16:55.713
Mm-hmm. Well, if you want
to try the real thing,

16:55.714 --> 16:58.281
Why don't you come over
to my house on Saturday night?

16:59.918 --> 17:03.120
Well, hello, brad and randy.

17:03.121 --> 17:04.887
Hi, mom.

17:04.888 --> 17:06.022
Where's mark?

17:06.023 --> 17:08.058
He's upstairs playing.

17:08.059 --> 17:09.492
Is he ok?

17:09.493 --> 17:11.996
Yeah, he's fine.
Why do you ask?

17:11.997 --> 17:14.431
No reason. Just because
we love him.

17:16.701 --> 17:19.036
Hope you're hungry.

17:19.037 --> 17:20.270
Oh, yeah.

17:20.271 --> 17:23.007
Oh. Guess I'm done
with this now.

17:23.008 --> 17:25.442
That had
our tadpoles in it.

17:25.443 --> 17:28.244
Not anymore.
Soup, anyone?

17:28.246 --> 17:31.448
What's up, guys?
Hi, mom.

17:31.449 --> 17:33.117
Is mark eating this?

17:33.118 --> 17:35.552
No, that's just for you.
I'm having ice cream.

17:35.553 --> 17:37.287
Oh, sweetie,
it's right over there.

17:37.288 --> 17:41.591
Well, hi. I've got the soup
for the boys all ready.
You want some?

17:41.592 --> 17:43.694
Well, what's in it?

17:43.695 --> 17:46.530
Oh, a tad of this,
tad of that.

17:47.766 --> 17:50.467
Sounds a tad
too rich for me.

17:50.468 --> 17:54.371
Oh, I get it. You want us
to think the tadpoles
are in the soup.

17:54.372 --> 17:57.440
Now why would your mother
do something like that?

17:57.441 --> 17:59.342
Come on, dig in.

17:59.343 --> 18:02.245
Come on, randy. This is
just a big bluff.
Yeah.

18:02.246 --> 18:04.882
Come on, boys. Hop to it.

18:13.925 --> 18:17.027
You know, it does
taste kind of weird.

18:17.028 --> 18:20.030
Yeah, but there's no way
it's tadpoles.

18:20.031 --> 18:23.167
Oh, I guess I can't
fool you guys.

18:23.168 --> 18:24.334
Ooh!

18:24.335 --> 18:27.004
Well, what is this?

18:27.005 --> 18:30.174
<i>(both scream)</i>

18:30.175 --> 18:32.642
Yeah!

18:32.643 --> 18:36.246
It's just a rubber frog.
How did that feel?

18:36.247 --> 18:38.281
Next time you feel like
pulling something,

18:38.282 --> 18:41.318
Maybe you'll remember that
I see all, hear all, know all
that goes on in this house.

18:41.319 --> 18:43.887
Do you understand?

18:43.888 --> 18:45.622
<i>(both)</i> we're sorry.

18:45.623 --> 18:49.459
Ok. Now I'll fix

Hey, bob. Who do you think
is going to win the race, huh?

19:33.071 --> 19:36.073
It's for charity,
tim. The real winners
are the children.

19:36.074 --> 19:38.976
Of course they are, bob.
The winners are the kids.

19:38.977 --> 19:43.914

In a distant third, bob.

Oh, boy.

So... How was your day?

21:24.482 --> 21:25.815
Well...

21:25.816 --> 21:30.153
When I heard on the news
that there was a lawn mower

21:30.154 --> 21:34.224
Running amuck down I-96

21:34.225 --> 21:37.560
With a police helicopter
in hot pursuit,

21:37.561 --> 21:40.630

"could this be my husband?"

21:40.631 --> 21:41.932
Are you all right?

21:41.933 --> 21:43.967
Pretty good chance of that.
Yeah, I'm all right.

There's good news and bad news.
The bad news is...

21:46.604 --> 21:49.873
I got a ticket, and they
impounded the lawn mower.

21:49.874 --> 21:51.308
What's the good news?

21:51.309 --> 21:53.143
Good news is...

21:53.144 --> 21:55.445
I mowed 40 lawns
and made 186 bucks.

21:59.417 --> 22:02.052
What is this thing?

22:02.053 --> 22:05.355
This thing is a helmet-cam
so we could see my perspective
during the race.
