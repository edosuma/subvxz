is very challenging.

1:13:25.276 --> 1:13:27.528

1:13:29.363 --> 1:13:31.657

kind of bike that you would buy

We always knew that this season
would have a lot of scope

1:13:43.169 --> 1:13:45.046
and scale.
So, we shot a lot

1:13:45.129 --> 1:13:48.966
in Singapore, where the streets
look beautiful and gleaming.

1:13:49.175 --> 1:13:52.386
And, it really looks idyllic
in a way, and ordered.

1:13:52.470 --> 1:13:55.473
But as Dolores comes
to understand the world,

1:13:55.932 --> 1:13:59.268
she realizes that there is
a darkness underlying

1:13:59.352 --> 1:14:00.311
that order.

1:14:00.603 --> 1:14:01.687
(HYDRAULIC LOCK OPENS)

1:14:01.771 --> 1:14:03.564
EVAN RACHEL WOOD: Dolores
discovers that,

1:14:03.648 --> 1:14:04.857
in the real world,

1:14:05.274 --> 1:14:07.693
there has been some serious
data collecting going on,

1:14:07.777 --> 1:14:09.403
just like the place
that she came from.

1:14:09.487 --> 1:14:12.323
She learns about
this large company, Insight,

1:14:12.406 --> 1:14:15.034
which has all the promises
of this utopia,

1:14:15.117 --> 1:14:18.037
and a way to really sort of
carve out your life for you.

1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:20.915
It basically
is the tech company.

1:14:20.998 --> 1:14:23.042
If one tech company
took over the world,

1:14:23.125 --> 1:14:24.418
it would be a company like this.

1:14:24.669 --> 1:14:26.879
It has a vast
artificial intelligence,

1:14:26.963 --> 1:14:30.883
that looks at the aggregated
data of all individuals.

1:14:31.258 --> 1:14:33.761
My dad thought that if you could
chart a course

1:14:33.844 --> 1:14:37.264
for every single person,
then you could make the world

1:14:37.348 --> 1:14:38.182
a better place.

1:14:38.641 --> 1:14:40.643
JOY: We live in a world now
where, between social media

1:14:40.726 --> 1:14:44.105
and location tracking,
and phone calls, and emails,

1:14:44.522 --> 1:14:47.984
there is a digital trail
for each of us.

1:14:48.609 --> 1:14:51.487
What if 30 more years elapse,
exactly the trajectory

1:14:51.570 --> 1:14:52.822
we're on, right now.

1:14:53.197 --> 1:14:54.699
What does that world look like?

1:14:56.200 --> 1:14:58.619
MAN: People die because
of our machines.

1:14:58.703 --> 1:15:01.038
Robots don't kill people,
people kill people.

1:15:01.497 --> 1:15:04.458
One person in particular,
who orchestrated that massacre,

1:15:04.542 --> 1:15:05.710
Bernard Lowe.

1:15:06.335 --> 1:15:10.047
The starter of season three,
we find Bernard

1:15:10.381 --> 1:15:15.302
in what is essentially
a industrial meat farm.

1:15:15.594 --> 1:15:17.555
He's been framed
for the events

1:15:17.722 --> 1:15:19.682
that happened in the park,
so he finds himself

1:15:19.765 --> 1:15:22.935
a fugitive.
But he's also trying to discover

1:15:23.561 --> 1:15:25.604
‐what Dolores' path is.
‐EVAN RACHEL WOOD: Dolores,

1:15:25.688 --> 1:15:27.982
ultimately, is really trying
to survive.

1:15:28.065 --> 1:15:30.276
She obviously has other allies,
but I think she feels

1:15:30.359 --> 1:15:32.236
a really special bond with Hale.

1:15:32.570 --> 1:15:35.823
The two of them are very alone
in this crusade.

1:15:36.157 --> 1:15:37.533
TESSA THOMPSON: At the beginning
of this season,

1:15:37.616 --> 1:15:40.619
this Hale that we see now
is a complete new invention.

1:15:40.828 --> 1:15:43.581
There's a lot of mystery
as to what she is, who she is.

1:15:44.081 --> 1:15:48.002
We know, leaving season two,
that she's not the Hale

1:15:48.085 --> 1:15:50.004
we once knew.
The question becomes,

1:15:50.087 --> 1:15:51.714
who the Hale is she?

1:15:53.674 --> 1:15:55.217
MAN 2: I want this, and the car.

1:15:56.135 --> 1:15:57.428
You ever drive one
of those things?

1:15:59.597 --> 1:16:01.640
You would imagine that
a total surveillance state

1:16:01.724 --> 1:16:04.310
means no more crime.
That's not how things work out.

1:16:04.518 --> 1:16:05.978
Make money, mother fuckers.

1:16:06.187 --> 1:16:09.148
AARON PAUL: Rico app,
it's how Caleb is able

1:16:09.231 --> 1:16:11.192
to get that extra cash.

1:16:11.275 --> 1:16:12.693
It's‐‐ It's really hard
for him,

1:16:12.777 --> 1:16:14.695
just working
the construction job

1:16:14.779 --> 1:16:15.863
to pay the bills.

1:16:15.946 --> 1:16:17.615
NOLAN: Crime is part
of our economy.

1:16:17.990 --> 1:16:18.949
It's not going anywhere.

1:16:19.366 --> 1:16:22.620
Rico is an app built on
the reality of the blockchain.

1:16:22.912 --> 1:16:24.955
Which changes the way
the internet works.

1:16:25.372 --> 1:16:27.625
You and I can have
a financial exchange of services

1:16:27.958 --> 1:16:29.835
that the government
cannot possibly track or trace,

1:16:29.919 --> 1:16:30.795
that is infallible.

1:16:31.128 --> 1:16:33.130
Meaning, I can't cheat you,
you can't cheat me.

1:16:33.506 --> 1:16:36.467
You download the app,
specify the level of criminality

1:16:36.634 --> 1:16:38.344
which you are willing
to participate in.

1:16:38.594 --> 1:16:40.429
Caleb is not willing
to participate in,

1:16:40.513 --> 1:16:42.556
what we call, personals.
Kidnapping, murder,

1:16:42.640 --> 1:16:43.474
the heavy shit.

1:16:43.808 --> 1:16:45.434
‐RICO USER: You do personals?
‐Nah.

1:16:45.810 --> 1:16:47.603
You should.
Your stats are shitty man.

1:16:47.686 --> 1:16:49.188
Petty larceny,
grand theft auto,

1:16:49.271 --> 1:16:50.147
all those things, sure.

1:16:50.356 --> 1:16:51.857
‐RICO USER: How you been?
‐Good.

1:16:53.025 --> 1:16:54.068
He okay?

1:16:54.443 --> 1:16:55.653
Tell him you okay, G.

1:16:55.986 --> 1:16:57.988
I'm most definitely not okay.

1:16:58.572 --> 1:17:01.325
I got a newfound respect
for the actors, to see the‐‐

1:17:01.534 --> 1:17:02.827
the long hours
that they put in,

1:17:03.077 --> 1:17:05.746
at the drop of a dime, just,
get into character‐‐

1:17:05.830 --> 1:17:07.498
‐(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
‐...and be able to perform.

1:17:08.165 --> 1:17:10.084
‐No smoke, please.
‐CREWMEMBER 4: No smoke at all.

1:17:10.167 --> 1:17:12.586
Jonah was directing,
who is so meticulous

1:17:12.670 --> 1:17:15.464
and fast and‐‐
and knows exactly what he wants

1:17:15.548 --> 1:17:16.841
everything to do and be.

1:17:17.091 --> 1:17:19.093
But...
There's a lot of moving parts,

1:17:19.176 --> 1:17:21.303
they needed the explosion
to look exactly right.

1:17:21.387 --> 1:17:22.930
But once we got comfortable
with it,

1:17:23.013 --> 1:17:24.014
it just felt amazing.

1:17:26.100 --> 1:17:28.185
I think Caleb has nothing left
to lose.

1:17:28.644 --> 1:17:31.230
And maybe he doesn't value
his life that much, honestly.

1:17:31.313 --> 1:17:33.607
But the one thing
that doesn't really stop,

1:17:34.108 --> 1:17:37.319
is his capacity to feel
for others.

1:17:37.570 --> 1:17:41.157
So when he finds Dolores,
his programming insists

1:17:41.782 --> 1:17:43.242
that he save her.

1:17:43.742 --> 1:17:46.787
While Dolores is very hard
to kill... (CHUCKLES)

1:17:47.329 --> 1:17:49.540
She is capable of‐‐
of dying.

1:17:49.748 --> 1:17:51.792
And of needing help
and being vulnerable.

1:17:51.876 --> 1:17:54.003
And she literally falls
into Caleb's arms.

1:17:54.253 --> 1:17:57.590
Much like the way she fell
into William's arms.

1:17:57.965 --> 1:17:59.925
So I think right away
we know that

1:18:00.009 --> 1:18:01.177
something's about to begin.
