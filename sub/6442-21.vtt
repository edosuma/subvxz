00:04.428 --> 00:05.918
Thanks.

00:06.631 --> 00:09.998
We'll see how far two semesters
of French gets me.

00:10.201 --> 00:12.135
Just remember, a smile goes a long way.

00:12.336 --> 00:14.236
Even in Paris.

00:14.572 --> 00:17.006
And to smooth the transition....

00:18.442 --> 00:21.002
-Lex, I already have a ticket.
-I know.

00:21.212 --> 00:23.442
I just got you a little upgrade.

00:23.648 --> 00:27.277
It's open-ended, for whenever you're ready
to say goodbye to Smallville.

00:27.485 --> 00:31.182
-This is first class. I can't accept this.
-You have to. It's a gift.

00:31.522 --> 00:32.784
Trust me.

00:32.990 --> 00:35.481
This is gonna be a year
you'll never forget.

00:39.363 --> 00:41.593
-Clark.
-I didn't mean to interrupt.

00:41.999 --> 00:43.728
-I didn't know you were here.
-No.

00:43.935 --> 00:47.268
Lex was just giving me some
last-minute travel tips.

00:49.040 --> 00:51.975
-When is the big day?
-Saturday.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.912
I should probably go.

01:02.453 --> 01:03.977
Thanks.

01:11.028 --> 01:12.655
Clark, you need to let her go.

01:14.098 --> 01:16.157
I suppose I don't have much of a choice.

01:16.367 --> 01:18.733
She's the one who wanted to leave.

01:20.104 --> 01:23.471
And if there's anybody
who set that ball in motion, it's you.

01:23.674 --> 01:27.075
Clark, all Lana's ever wanted is for you
to be honest with her.

01:27.278 --> 01:29.212
If you're not willing to step up...

01:29.413 --> 01:32.712
...you need to move aside
and let her get on with her life.

01:55.773 --> 01:57.968
Time for lights out. Good night, Emily.

02:01.212 --> 02:02.702
Night.

02:09.854 --> 02:13.085
Logging off at 21 1 5 hours.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.429
Hello?

03:52.590 --> 03:56.424
You're ruining it.
It's perfect and you're ruining it.

03:57.027 --> 03:58.585
You must be Lana.

03:58.796 --> 04:00.764
This place doesn't belong to you.

04:02.500 --> 04:07.335
Miss Lang, I know you put a lot of work
into this coffee shop...

04:07.538 --> 04:09.472
...but you signed the papers.

04:22.620 --> 04:24.315
It belongs to Lana.

05:30.855 --> 05:33.187
Get out there and take your shot.

05:34.358 --> 05:39.386
-Yep. She's moving to Wichita.
-Wichita?

05:39.697 --> 05:41.790
Yeah, she got the federal judgeship.

05:41.966 --> 05:43.900
She starts work on Monday.

05:44.301 --> 05:46.565
That was fast.

05:46.737 --> 05:49.831
-What about your dad?
-Well, he's staying in Smallville.

05:51.141 --> 05:53.974
I guess that means they're
going through with the divorce.

05:54.144 --> 05:55.509
I'm really sorry, Pete.

05:55.913 --> 05:57.881
I've been avoiding the whole thing...

05:58.048 --> 06:02.678
...because I knew when I finally told you,
it'd-- lt'd definitely sink in.

06:03.487 --> 06:06.354
Guess you're the last man standing
in the nuclear family zone.

06:06.657 --> 06:11.117
Pete, you're not losing your family,
it's just changing.

06:11.295 --> 06:14.492
It can be hard to find out your
parents are hiding things from you.

06:14.765 --> 06:17.359
It's just so weird when you realize
that the people...

06:17.534 --> 06:21.994
...you thought had all the answers
are just human like everybody else.

06:22.740 --> 06:24.139
What are you gonna do?

06:24.308 --> 06:27.744
I didn't go through three years of high
school just to miss out on senior year.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.408
I wish Lana felt that way.

06:33.150 --> 06:37.519
I'm gonna say this once and then it falls
into the "none of my business" category.

06:37.688 --> 06:40.782
The whole yo-yo thing with you and Lana?
It's gotta stop.

06:40.958 --> 06:44.291
You sound like Lex.
He thinks I'm the reason Lana's leaving.

06:44.461 --> 06:46.622
I hate to agree with Uncle Fester...

06:46.797 --> 06:50.233
...but I don't think Lana's going to Paris
just to see the Mona Lisa.

06:51.435 --> 06:53.335
You ever wish I'd never
told you about me?

06:56.707 --> 07:00.404
It's rough at times,
covering with Chloe and everybody...

07:01.478 --> 07:04.914
...but the truth is, no one's ever
put that much trust in me before.

07:09.086 --> 07:11.919
You're not thinking about coming clean
with Lana, are you?

07:12.089 --> 07:15.354
It might be the only way to stop her
from getting on that plane.

07:36.113 --> 07:40.345
-Looks like you could use a garage sale.
-Yeah, you'd think I was....

07:40.551 --> 07:42.109
Moving halfway around the world?

07:43.854 --> 07:46.186
You know, I think that's pretty brave.

07:47.324 --> 07:49.189
Did you lose something?

07:49.360 --> 07:52.625
Yeah, my mom's bracelet.

07:57.901 --> 08:00.995
Lana, I know you're busy with
the move and everything...

08:01.705 --> 08:05.232
...but I was wondering if you'd
wanna have dinner with me...tonight?

08:08.912 --> 08:11.312
I don't know if that's
such a great idea, Clark.

08:15.386 --> 08:17.684
There's something I should've told you.

08:17.855 --> 08:19.584
I should've told you a long time ago.

08:20.557 --> 08:24.653
-ls everything okay?
-I hope it will be.

08:30.734 --> 08:34.067
Yeah, of course.
Of course I'll be there.

08:42.011 --> 08:45.413
This is Emily 1 1 months ago.

08:45.582 --> 08:49.518
This is Emily now.

08:53.223 --> 08:54.952
She looks just like her mother.

08:55.125 --> 08:58.788
Yeah, well, I bet her mother can't
move through a brick wall.

08:58.962 --> 09:02.398
She didn't go out the door, Mr. Dinsmore,
she went through the door.

09:03.267 --> 09:05.633
You created her, how'd she do it?

09:06.737 --> 09:10.696
That means her molecules are vibrating so
fast, they can be absorbed through matter.

09:10.874 --> 09:16.369
Well, that's a little detail that my
ex-project director failed to discover.

09:19.450 --> 09:21.816
Where do you think she's going,
Mr. Dinsmore?

09:22.553 --> 09:26.455
Last time she left, she went straight to
her best childhood friend.

09:26.623 --> 09:30.184
Yes, Lana Lang. And that meeting ended
with Miss Lang near death...

09:30.360 --> 09:33.591
-...at the bottom of a river.
-You can't blame her for that.

09:33.764 --> 09:37.165
No matter what age Emily appears to be,
her emotional development...

09:37.334 --> 09:39.700
-...is that of a child.
-Well, she's not a child.

09:39.870 --> 09:43.499
She's a failed experiment
and a colossal liability.

09:46.643 --> 09:52.013
Mr. Dinsmore, it is imperative
that I find her before anyone else.

09:55.352 --> 09:57.513
All right, I'm gonna do one
of two things.

09:57.688 --> 10:01.784
I'm gonna either send out a team that will
do whatever it takes to retrieve her...

10:01.959 --> 10:05.520
...or I will send you...

10:07.231 --> 10:08.459
...her father.

10:12.202 --> 10:15.228
Well, I guess you're not gonna
miss the 5 a.m. pastry deliveries.

10:15.405 --> 10:18.897
It's weird. All I was trying to do
was save this place from being torn down.

10:19.076 --> 10:22.512
Next thing I know,
it kind of took over my life.

10:22.679 --> 10:24.340
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

10:24.515 --> 10:27.541
I thought they were turning the Talon
into a house of heartburn.

10:28.218 --> 10:30.243
Why would I do that?

10:35.058 --> 10:36.889
-You must be Lana.
-Yeah.

10:37.060 --> 10:38.652
I thought I was meeting Mr. Kerns.

10:39.763 --> 10:43.529
-He's my dad.
-Oh, I didn't realize.

10:43.700 --> 10:45.361
He sent me to set everything up.

10:45.536 --> 10:48.164
-I'm Emma.
-Hi.

10:51.808 --> 10:54.675
Have we met before?
You seem really familiar.

10:55.612 --> 10:57.307
Everybody says that.

10:57.981 --> 11:01.417
This is Chloe. She'll be one of your
frequent "caffeinators."

11:01.585 --> 11:04.053
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:04.221 --> 11:08.089
Just out of curiosity, what's going on
with the burrito bar?

11:08.258 --> 11:09.623
Oh, it was all wrong.

11:09.793 --> 11:12.921
Everything-- It's perfect just the way it is.

11:13.797 --> 11:18.257
Lana, would you mind staying around a
little while and showing me the ropes?

11:18.435 --> 11:20.027
No, no. It's the least I could do.

11:21.572 --> 11:24.063
Oh, and I wanted to give you these.

11:24.241 --> 11:26.004
Found an extra set of keys.

11:26.176 --> 11:29.873
I sort of feel like I'm handing over
half of my life to you.

11:30.380 --> 11:33.543
Don't worry, it's in good hands.

11:43.293 --> 11:45.557
-Hi.
-Hey, Mom.

11:50.801 --> 11:52.769
Does this mean I'm off the hook
for dinner?

11:52.936 --> 11:54.301
I invited Lana over.

11:55.672 --> 11:57.572
It must be hard to say goodbye.

11:59.776 --> 12:02.745
Well, if this works, I won't have to.

12:04.348 --> 12:06.578
Do you think it's fair
to keep doing this to her?

12:06.750 --> 12:10.208
No. That's why I've decided
to tell her tonight.

12:11.521 --> 12:13.318
Tell her?

12:14.191 --> 12:15.681
Everything.

12:15.859 --> 12:17.417
Clark...

12:18.562 --> 12:22.191
...asking someone to keep your
secret is a big responsibility, you know.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.891
-Look at Pete. It hasn't been easy for him.
-I know.

12:25.068 --> 12:27.161
And Pete has had some close calls.

12:27.337 --> 12:29.396
But I'm still glad I told him and so is he.

12:29.573 --> 12:31.803
It's made us better friends.

12:32.943 --> 12:36.902
-Are you sure Lana's ready?
-She keeps asking me to be honest.

12:37.080 --> 12:39.275
I owe her the chance
to decide for herself.

12:42.853 --> 12:45.185
I guess it's not fair to raise you
as one of us...

12:45.355 --> 12:50.452
...and then try to keep you from
experiencing one of the best parts of life.

12:51.695 --> 12:52.957
So you're okay with this?

12:54.197 --> 12:57.223
I trust you to make your own decision.

13:01.705 --> 13:03.696
I told you about the delivery truck, right?

13:03.874 --> 13:06.274
-Tuesday mornings at 6.
-Yeah.

13:06.810 --> 13:12.715
Well, I guess that's everything.

13:12.883 --> 13:15.283
It was fun having you around today.

13:15.452 --> 13:19.388
Are you sure you want to leave all this?
I mean, everything you know is here.

13:20.257 --> 13:24.591
Yeah, well, you know,
that's exactly why I need to go.

13:24.761 --> 13:28.390
That's too bad.
I thought we could've been friends.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.365
Maybe even best friends.

13:36.039 --> 13:38.974
Well, I'm sorry we won't get a chance
to know each other better.

13:39.142 --> 13:40.473
We already do, silly.

13:42.312 --> 13:43.870
I'll show you.

13:50.887 --> 13:52.980
-Mr. Dinsmore?
-ls she here?

13:53.523 --> 13:55.923
-Who?
-Emily.

13:59.863 --> 14:01.262
Oh, my God.

14:02.032 --> 14:05.399
I knew she would come to you, Lana.
I have to get her back to LuthorCorp.

14:05.569 --> 14:08.037
-You know how dangerous she is.
-What does she want?

14:16.980 --> 14:18.379
You have to forgive me.

14:18.849 --> 14:21.784
I forgave you.
That's what friends do.

14:37.868 --> 14:40.098
I'm sorry, Lana.

15:13.003 --> 15:15.062
Emily!

15:21.711 --> 15:26.273
Help! Help me! Somebody help me!

15:28.452 --> 15:30.044
Emily!

15:31.922 --> 15:35.153
Help! Help!

15:48.305 --> 15:52.867
That's not exactly the face of someone who
just secured another government contract.

15:53.610 --> 15:58.172
-Everything okay?
-Fine. Everything is just...

15:58.348 --> 15:59.747
...fine.

15:59.916 --> 16:01.543
I...

16:02.185 --> 16:05.086
...asked you here because l....

16:06.156 --> 16:08.249
I need your help, son.

16:08.625 --> 16:12.755
I have an executive
who has proven himself...

16:12.929 --> 16:16.296
...in so many ways,
and I want to reward his efforts...

16:16.466 --> 16:19.993
...or his accomplishments with a--

16:20.170 --> 16:22.798
I don't know, a promotion.

16:23.406 --> 16:24.771
I'm missing the dilemma.

16:24.941 --> 16:29.139
The dilemma is that I have a feeling
he's not trustworthy.

16:30.647 --> 16:32.672
What would you do
if you were in my shoes?

16:32.849 --> 16:37.286
Would you give him a chance
to fess up?

16:38.321 --> 16:42.087
To confess to any disloyal behavior
he's guilty of?

16:42.459 --> 16:46.953
Maybe the same ruthless qualities
that make you question his trust...

16:47.130 --> 16:50.327
...would make him a valuable asset
when it comes to running a company.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.024
Or maybe they'd...

16:52.202 --> 16:54.102
...just make him...

16:57.407 --> 16:59.534
...a disloyal son.

17:00.644 --> 17:03.340
-Dad.
-You betrayed me, your own father.

17:03.513 --> 17:05.640
I protected myself,
just like you taught me to.

17:05.815 --> 17:10.718
Lex, whatever problems we have, keep them
within the walls of our own house.

17:10.887 --> 17:14.323
-Don't stoop to this level.
-Spare me the lecture, Dad.

17:16.726 --> 17:21.220
I had nothing to do with the murders of
Dr. Teng and her team at the Metron lab.

17:22.031 --> 17:25.297
You sold me out to the cops
for your inexplicable blood experiments.

17:25.468 --> 17:29.029
-I did it to make you stronger.
-The hell you did!

17:29.372 --> 17:31.966
You can't hide every deceitful thing
you've done to me...

17:32.142 --> 17:34.576
...under the guise of mentorship!

17:35.779 --> 17:37.770
You brought this on yourself.

17:40.150 --> 17:42.141
You've gotten careless.

17:42.319 --> 17:44.014
Why is that, Dad?

17:44.187 --> 17:48.146
Why would you risk everything
on all these obscure projects?

17:50.126 --> 17:51.957
What could be that important?

17:52.128 --> 17:57.589
If you had given me any reason
to trust you...

17:58.835 --> 18:00.860
...you wouldn't have to ask that question.

18:03.406 --> 18:04.896
Get out.

18:20.957 --> 18:23.653
-What?
-Yeah, it's Loder.

18:24.027 --> 18:25.756
Your kid hasn't found anything.

18:26.363 --> 18:29.594
If he does, believe me,
I'll make sure it stays buried.

18:30.233 --> 18:31.632
Good.

18:32.035 --> 18:33.866
And our other...

18:34.771 --> 18:38.366
-...situation?
-I'm looking into the Ross kid.

18:38.541 --> 18:39.769
All right.

18:40.276 --> 18:43.609
-Go talk to him.
-I'm working on it.

19:04.901 --> 19:06.994
Your mother told me you were up here.

19:07.937 --> 19:11.737
Don't worry, Dad. Lana stood me up.
The secret's still safe.

19:13.076 --> 19:14.737
You know...

19:14.911 --> 19:18.813
...there could be 1 00 different reasons
why Lana didn't show up here tonight.

19:19.949 --> 19:22.213
None of them might have anything
to do with you.

19:23.219 --> 19:26.347
I've given Lana so many reasons
not to trust me.

19:28.291 --> 19:29.952
But I'm not gonna give up.

19:30.393 --> 19:32.918
There's no way I can talk you
out of this, right?

19:39.636 --> 19:45.199
Clark, sometimes a person can hold on
too tight for too long.

19:45.375 --> 19:48.469
Dad, I've liked Lana since the first time
I saw her. You know that.

19:48.645 --> 19:52.081
-It's not gonna change.
-I'm not talking about you.

19:52.248 --> 19:54.409
I'm talking about me.

19:54.584 --> 19:59.146
You see, a father is supposed to
help his son build a life...

20:00.623 --> 20:02.454
...not try to hold him back from one.

20:03.159 --> 20:07.858
-But you still think it's a bad idea?
-Yeah, I do.

20:08.598 --> 20:13.695
But honestly, Clark, I don't trust
my instincts the way I used to.

20:16.573 --> 20:18.473
I just hope you can trust yours.

20:36.960 --> 20:40.157
-Excuse me.
-Can I help you?

20:40.330 --> 20:44.164
-I'm Clark Kent. I'm a friend of Lana's.
-Then the first cup of coffee is free.

20:44.334 --> 20:46.325
Actually, I'm just looking for her.

20:46.503 --> 20:50.166
She was supposed to meet me last night.
Chloe said the last time she saw her...

20:50.340 --> 20:54.436
-...she was here with you.
-Oh. She didn't tell you?

20:55.311 --> 20:57.108
Lana's gone.

20:57.413 --> 20:59.574
She already left for Paris.

20:59.883 --> 21:02.010
She wasn't supposed to leave
for two more days.

21:02.185 --> 21:05.177
-Maybe she changed her mind.
-She wouldn't just leave like that.

21:05.355 --> 21:07.380
Not without saying goodbye to anyone.

21:07.557 --> 21:11.721
I heard her say something
about hating goodbyes.

21:35.652 --> 21:37.950
I made us TV dinners.

21:39.956 --> 21:43.221
They're our favorite, with the brownie.

21:45.128 --> 21:49.292
Emily, I'm sure that you've been
through a lot...

21:49.465 --> 21:52.593
...and I know that you're
probably very lonely.

21:53.002 --> 21:56.096
But we can still be friends
without you keeping me in here.

21:56.272 --> 21:58.433
How can we be best friends
if you go away?

22:00.543 --> 22:02.704
We'll write each other letters.

22:02.879 --> 22:04.676
You know, and you can come visit me.

22:04.848 --> 22:07.408
-Wouldn't you like to see Paris?
-No.

22:07.584 --> 22:09.609
I don't want you to go either.

22:09.853 --> 22:12.219
Things are better this way.
You'll see.

22:12.388 --> 22:16.017
We'll have so much fun.
And then, one day, if you're good...

22:16.192 --> 22:17.989
...we can run the Talon together.

22:20.029 --> 22:21.587
Emily...

22:22.665 --> 22:26.829
...you can't just force someone
to be your friend.

22:27.003 --> 22:30.336
It's something that happens over time
when you trust each other.

22:30.506 --> 22:32.872
I know what a friend is.

22:33.243 --> 22:38.408
A friend is someone who would
stand up for you and protect you.

22:38.581 --> 22:43.177
A friend is someone who would jump in
a river to save you from drowning...

22:43.519 --> 22:46.750
...even if it meant they had to give up
their own life for you.

22:47.991 --> 22:50.186
You don't need to tell me...

22:51.427 --> 22:53.952
...what it means to be a friend.

22:54.597 --> 23:00.502
Then you know that a friend would
never keep me locked up in here.

23:01.437 --> 23:02.699
Get used to it.

23:03.306 --> 23:04.568
I did.

23:11.981 --> 23:14.313
People are going to come looking for me.

23:15.184 --> 23:16.583
No.

23:17.487 --> 23:18.852
They won't.

23:22.992 --> 23:24.983
They think you already went to Paris.

23:39.342 --> 23:41.606
My father found the wire, Clark.

23:41.778 --> 23:45.077
The FBl's dropping the case unless
I can find something incriminating.

23:45.248 --> 23:48.149
With everything your father's done,
that shouldn't be too hard.

23:48.318 --> 23:51.617
Well, my father's sort of mastered the art
of covering his tracks.

23:51.788 --> 23:54.018
You wouldn't know anything about that,
would you?

23:54.190 --> 23:56.522
You mean like hiding things
from your best friend?

23:56.693 --> 23:58.251
You tell me, Lex.

23:58.428 --> 23:59.952
Look, I'm a little under the gun.

24:00.129 --> 24:02.597
If I upset you,
you're gonna have to be more specific.

24:02.765 --> 24:05.598
Lana's ticket.
Why didn't you tell me you changed it?

24:05.768 --> 24:07.861
Well, I didn't think
I needed your permission.

24:08.037 --> 24:10.631
If anything, I thought I was buying
you more time.

24:10.807 --> 24:13.935
It's an open-ended ticket
so she can leave whenever she wants.

24:16.946 --> 24:20.905
-So she didn't say goodbye to you, either?
-What's going on?

24:21.084 --> 24:23.416
According to the daughter of
the new Talon owner...

24:23.586 --> 24:25.986
..."whenever she wants" was today.

24:26.823 --> 24:28.381
Lana's gone.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.858
Clark, the new owner
doesn't have a daughter.

24:48.044 --> 24:49.272
Sorry, we're closed.

24:49.445 --> 24:50.912
Why did you tell me Lana left?

24:51.080 --> 24:54.277
My friend pulled some strings and checked.
She never got on any plane.

24:54.450 --> 24:58.318
Like you care. You weren't a very good
friend if you were gonna let her go away.

24:58.488 --> 25:02.618
-What did you do to her?
-She doesn't need you anymore.

25:02.825 --> 25:04.486
You tell me where she is.

25:04.660 --> 25:08.494
You were nicer to me when I was little.
You told me you were different too.

25:08.664 --> 25:12.657
So you know what it's like
to be left alone without anybody.

25:30.253 --> 25:32.278
Good evening, Miss Sullivan.

25:33.923 --> 25:36.824
Just when you thought it was safe
to go back into the hallways.

25:36.993 --> 25:39.723
All right, you can cut the sarcasm.

25:39.896 --> 25:42.364
I'm only here because I need your help.

25:43.132 --> 25:47.296
With all your resources, Mr. Luthor,
what could you possibly want from me?

25:47.470 --> 25:48.994
Your friendship...

25:51.107 --> 25:52.438
...with Lana Lang.

25:52.608 --> 25:56.806
A young woman in my care,
daughter of a friend, is missing.

25:56.979 --> 26:00.380
-We can't locate her.
-I'll congratulate her when I see her.

26:00.550 --> 26:02.541
I don't know what this has
to do with Lana--

26:02.718 --> 26:06.484
Her father was looking for her.
He's disappeared as well.

26:06.756 --> 26:11.659
She was Lana's best friend
when they were children.

26:11.828 --> 26:14.991
So it's possible she might show up
here in Smallville.

26:15.465 --> 26:17.797
The girl is sick.

26:18.835 --> 26:22.430
Very sick. She needs treatment.

26:22.605 --> 26:26.371
If she's here in Smallville,
I'm sure you'll find out about it.

26:27.143 --> 26:29.338
I'll expect a call from you.

26:50.867 --> 26:54.860
Lana, your tea's gonna get cold.

27:05.214 --> 27:07.409
Would you like some more tea, Emily?

27:41.250 --> 27:43.775
You're not my friend anymore.

27:48.257 --> 27:49.690
It's Emily Dinsmore.

27:49.859 --> 27:52.589
They found her father's car
abandoned outside the Talon.

27:52.762 --> 27:56.129
Lionel must've nabbed her last year
after she pushed Lana off the bridge.

27:56.299 --> 28:00.201
And in the meantime, she's picked up
a bad habit of walking through walls.

28:00.369 --> 28:04.533
We know why Lionel's trying so hard to
get her back. He can't let Lex find her first.

28:04.774 --> 28:07.402
Wait a minute, when did Lex
enter the equation?

28:08.177 --> 28:12.079
Chloe, Lex has been working with the FBl
to try and take down his father.

28:12.715 --> 28:16.116
If you knew Lex was looking for dirt
on Lionel, why didn't you tell him...

28:16.285 --> 28:18.753
-...about his grandparents?
-We never had evidence...

28:18.921 --> 28:22.857
...about what Lionel was doing. Besides,
the last time Lex confronted him about it...

28:23.025 --> 28:24.686
...it almost got him killed.

28:26.429 --> 28:30.559
But if we found Emily, then we could prove
that Lionel has been illegally cloning people.

28:30.733 --> 28:33.634
What I don't get is if Emily
could've escaped at any time...

28:33.803 --> 28:36.294
...why wait till now for the
sudden encore appearance?

28:36.472 --> 28:39.270
Maybe she found out
she was gonna lose Lana forever.

28:39.575 --> 28:43.136
Then the question is, what would you do
to keep someone from leaving?

28:44.780 --> 28:47.305
Try to make things go back
to the way they were before.

28:48.517 --> 28:50.508
You mean when they were kids?

28:51.053 --> 28:53.146
Emily still thinks Lana's her best friend...

28:53.322 --> 28:55.882
...and everything can be like
when they played together.

28:56.058 --> 28:58.322
You lived next door to Lana,
do you remember them?

28:58.494 --> 29:00.826
No, they spent most of their time
at Emily's.

29:00.997 --> 29:03.761
What we need to do is figure out
where that is.

29:09.272 --> 29:11.832
-Goodbye, Lana.
-Emily, please don't do this.

29:12.008 --> 29:13.635
Emily, please!

29:53.983 --> 29:55.610
Lana.

29:57.787 --> 29:59.414
Clark.

31:11.627 --> 31:13.219
-Was I speeding?
-No, kid.

31:13.396 --> 31:16.126
But I'm gonna have to ask you
to step out of the car.

31:17.199 --> 31:21.226
FBl. I just have a few questions for you.
It won't take long.

31:21.670 --> 31:24.571
-I'm pretty sure you got the wrong guy.
-You Pete Ross?

31:24.740 --> 31:25.968
Is this about my mom?

31:26.142 --> 31:29.043
Federal judges gotta go through
a routine security check.

31:29.211 --> 31:31.145
I just got a few questions to ask you.

31:33.549 --> 31:36.882
So you have information that could
put my father in prison.

31:37.052 --> 31:41.216
So did you, before you obliterated those
seven weeks of your memory at Belle Reve.

31:41.390 --> 31:44.587
-Do you know what he was trying to hide?
-Lex...

31:45.761 --> 31:49.094
...your father murdered his parents
in a tenement fire.

31:49.265 --> 31:52.757
He hired a crime lord named Morgan Edge
to do the dirty work.

31:53.369 --> 31:58.534
You got Edge's confession on videotape,
but Daddy Dearest destroyed it.

31:59.608 --> 32:01.769
Then there's no proof.

32:04.146 --> 32:08.139
Only the voice mail confession
of Lionel Luthor himself.

32:08.384 --> 32:11.785
He tried to scrub it, but erased voice
mail's like deleted computer files.

32:11.954 --> 32:14.354
Someone with enough pull
and the right password...

32:14.523 --> 32:16.548
...can resurrect them
from the cyber graveyard.

32:16.725 --> 32:19.285
-Why didn't you come to me sooner?
-Your psychiatrist...

32:19.462 --> 32:22.522
...didn't accidentally wrap her car
around a tree. You showed me...

32:22.698 --> 32:25.531
...the investigator's body
on a slab in the morgue.

32:25.701 --> 32:28.192
Luthor family politics can get
a little grim.

32:29.438 --> 32:30.996
Chloe...

32:33.309 --> 32:36.574
...it means a lot you're willing
to do this for me...

32:36.745 --> 32:42.308
...but if you come forward, you're putting
yourself between my father and the FBl.

32:42.918 --> 32:45.250
That's not a very safe place to be.

32:46.789 --> 32:48.313
I know.

32:49.024 --> 32:52.585
But I can't get out from under
your father's grip by myself.

32:52.761 --> 32:56.424
Besides, I know you won't
let anything happen to me.

33:01.170 --> 33:02.398
Get up!

33:03.873 --> 33:07.502
-You know how to swim, Pete?
-Get off me, man.

33:07.676 --> 33:11.407
-What are you doing?
-I'm losing my patience with you.

33:11.614 --> 33:13.582
You're crazy.

33:14.550 --> 33:18.179
-I don't know anything about a secret.
-You're just his best friend.

33:19.255 --> 33:22.156
You know, you can continue
to play the hero if you want...

33:22.324 --> 33:24.849
...but are the skeletons in his closet
worth your life?

33:25.027 --> 33:26.858
I'm not telling you anything.

33:27.696 --> 33:30.665
-Oh, I think you will.
-Loder!

33:33.168 --> 33:36.467
-Pete, you okay?
-You're the one who's got him after Clark?

33:36.639 --> 33:38.971
No. But I have a feeling my father did.

33:39.141 --> 33:43.339
Didn't he? He found out you were
working with me and paid you off.

33:43.512 --> 33:46.481
No wonder you were so anxious
to drop the case against him.

33:47.016 --> 33:51.680
I really don't want a morality lesson from
someone willing to rat out their own father.

33:52.421 --> 33:55.117
So how much did he toss in
to do leg work on Clark?

33:55.291 --> 33:58.021
If I was you, I'd be worried
less about this farm kid...

33:58.193 --> 34:00.684
...and more about the homicide charges
you'll face...

34:00.863 --> 34:05.232
-...when I throw you to Metropolis P.D.
-Somehow I'm not too concerned.

34:05.401 --> 34:08.268
I bet your supervisors would be
very interested...

34:08.437 --> 34:11.895
...to know about your
unique interrogation methods.

34:12.741 --> 34:14.174
What is it you want, Luthor?

34:14.342 --> 34:17.402
I want you to get back to the case
you were assigned.

34:18.981 --> 34:22.212
That's all the evidence you'll need
on my father.

34:30.259 --> 34:33.023
You're making a mistake, Lex.

34:36.465 --> 34:39.661
This kid is sitting on something
bigger than you...

34:40.936 --> 34:42.995
...or even your dad.

34:43.172 --> 34:45.333
Isn't that right, Pete?

34:54.817 --> 34:56.751
You sure you're all right?

34:59.221 --> 35:03.453
Clark was probably right
confiding in you instead of me.

35:03.626 --> 35:05.924
Couldn't ask for a better friend.

35:06.996 --> 35:08.725
Come on.

35:09.465 --> 35:11.262
I thought that guy was gonna kill me.

35:11.433 --> 35:13.560
I guess I owe you a thanks.

35:14.436 --> 35:17.997
I'm sure when the time comes
you'll do the same for me.

35:28.050 --> 35:29.677
Hey, Pete.

35:32.388 --> 35:35.880
-What happened to you?
-FBl agent decided to go off payroll.

35:36.058 --> 35:37.855
Wanted to know about you.

35:38.027 --> 35:40.052
Don't worry.
I didn't tell him anything.

35:40.796 --> 35:42.661
-I should've been there.
-That's just it.

35:42.831 --> 35:47.063
You can't always be there.
I gotta look out for myself.

35:49.071 --> 35:51.767
I just thought you should know
they're onto you.

35:52.541 --> 35:57.274
-Thanks for the warning.
-The FBl isn't who I'm warning you about.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.580
Lex was there.

35:59.748 --> 36:02.012
He's the one who pulled the fed off me.

36:02.885 --> 36:07.151
-He's investigating his father, not me.
-That doesn't matter. He knows.

36:07.322 --> 36:09.654
Now, I'm not exactly sure how much...

36:09.825 --> 36:12.521
...but he's not gonna stop
until he's got everything.

36:13.328 --> 36:15.455
Clark, you gotta keep an eye on him.

36:15.831 --> 36:17.594
Look out for yourself.

36:21.070 --> 36:22.560
Pete?

36:23.472 --> 36:25.463
Why are you talking like that?

36:25.874 --> 36:30.334
-I'm moving to Wichita with my mom.
-No, Pete.

36:30.546 --> 36:32.411
I thought that--

36:33.148 --> 36:34.877
What about senior year?

36:38.721 --> 36:41.781
No, Pete, you can't do this because of me.

36:41.957 --> 36:44.949
I know that I told you
keeping your secret wasn't hard...

36:45.661 --> 36:49.654
...but I lied. I walk around every day,
afraid that I'm gonna slip up.

36:49.832 --> 36:53.199
-Well, why didn't you tell me sooner?
-Because you needed a friend.

36:53.368 --> 36:55.165
And so did l.

36:56.672 --> 36:59.641
You don't have to move.
You don't have to change your whole life.

36:59.808 --> 37:02.106
There must be a way.
No one has to know we're friends.

37:02.277 --> 37:04.837
There's a lot of things that
I can handle...

37:05.013 --> 37:08.005
...but I could never live with myself
if I betrayed you.

37:10.319 --> 37:11.809
Pete.

37:14.556 --> 37:16.524
I'll see you around, Clark.

37:52.561 --> 37:54.085
Hi.

37:55.564 --> 37:58.362
-Lana.
-I heard Emily disappeared from Belle Reve...

37:58.534 --> 38:01.935
-...as soon as she was admitted.
-Yeah, even under heavy sedation.

38:02.404 --> 38:05.202
-Do you think she's going to come back?
-No.

38:05.607 --> 38:07.973
I think Lionel Luthor
will make sure of that.

38:10.479 --> 38:12.003
Are you okay?

38:13.148 --> 38:15.139
Yeah.

38:15.551 --> 38:17.246
Yeah, I'm fine.

38:19.087 --> 38:21.555
I'm just sorry that I ruined dinner.

38:21.723 --> 38:24.624
That's okay. I'm sure I've racked up
more than a few lOUs.

38:24.793 --> 38:28.058
Well, I was really looking forward to it.

38:28.397 --> 38:30.160
So was l.

38:33.001 --> 38:36.630
So there's something that
you wanted to tell me.

38:37.172 --> 38:38.571
What is it?

38:41.410 --> 38:44.208
I just wanted to tell you that....

38:58.961 --> 39:01.395
Have a great time in Paris.

39:01.797 --> 39:04.231
I hope you find what you're looking for.

39:12.541 --> 39:14.532
Goodbye, Clark.

40:08.530 --> 40:11.363
Forgive them, for they know not
what they do.

40:11.533 --> 40:13.899
Is that what you expect from me,
forgiveness?

40:14.069 --> 40:17.698
Don't try to make me out
as your own personal Judas.

40:17.873 --> 40:20.341
I didn't come here for forgiveness.

40:20.809 --> 40:24.609
I came here to congratulate you on
sweeping another mishap under the rug.

40:26.281 --> 40:30.615
-Emily Dinsmore?
-Oh, yes. Emily Dinsmore.

40:32.487 --> 40:37.447
I should have remembered.
You should have warned them.

40:37.626 --> 40:40.527
Belle Reve has a habit of...

40:40.929 --> 40:44.330
...misplacing its patients. The details--

40:44.499 --> 40:46.729
I've always tried to teach you, Lex.

40:47.169 --> 40:49.535
The devil is in the details.

40:49.705 --> 40:53.072
If you don't pay attention
to the details...

40:53.709 --> 40:54.937
...he'll win.

40:55.110 --> 40:57.738
Then it's a good thing I'm a fast learner.

40:57.913 --> 41:03.010
You went through all the trouble of having
your own son committed to an asylum...

41:03.185 --> 41:06.450
...and shooting 600 volts of electricity
through his body...

41:06.621 --> 41:08.782
...just to cover up your trespasses.

41:09.291 --> 41:13.751
But like I said, Dad,
you've gotten careless.

41:19.868 --> 41:23.304
Loder, why are you here?

41:23.805 --> 41:26.501
Lionel Luthor, you're under arrest.

41:28.844 --> 41:30.937
On what charge?

41:32.147 --> 41:36.880
The murder of your parents,
Lachlan and Eliza Luthor.

41:43.658 --> 41:45.285
Let's go.

41:49.297 --> 41:52.130
Be careful, son. Don't forget.

41:52.300 --> 41:55.360
Judas hung himself with his own rope.

41:58.000 --> 42:04.000
