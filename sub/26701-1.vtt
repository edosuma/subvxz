01:47.732 --> 01:52.070
You stay right there, Mrs. Djuvara.
I'm going to get something for your cough.

01:53.571 --> 01:55.073
Thank you, Dr. Tepes.

01:56.616 --> 01:59.536
It bubbles when I breathe. Did I say that?

01:59.619 --> 02:04.040
Yes, you did. Don't move.
I'll be right back with some medicine.

02:04.958 --> 02:10.130
More leaves, I expect.
Mr. Djuvara always gives me leaves.

02:10.421 --> 02:14.259
Leaves and acorns.
Probably turning into a squirrel.

02:15.593 --> 02:17.554
I didn't know you were married.

02:18.596 --> 02:23.101
My husband is traveling abroad.
He'll be home before winter's done.

02:23.643 --> 02:24.769
I'll be right back.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.127
Yes.

02:53.047 --> 02:56.426
I hate that you're not here, every day.

02:57.468 --> 03:00.179
But I love that you gave me the knowledge
to help people.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.610
Is that leaves?

03:13.693 --> 03:17.780
If I have to chew more cud,
I'm going to start making milk, Dr. Tepes.

03:17.864 --> 03:21.576
No, no. It's a powder
mixed with some strawberry wine.

03:21.659 --> 03:25.747
A powder? You sound like
the old wise woman we used to have.

03:26.164 --> 03:29.584
The powder turned out to be
her dried foot skin.

03:29.667 --> 03:32.754
My God.
I'm amazed any of you are still alive.

03:33.421 --> 03:37.050
No, this powder is a medicine
that grows as mold.

03:37.133 --> 03:41.221
You're giving me mold?
I think I want the leaves.

03:41.304 --> 03:45.225
Trust me. Take two sips three times a day
until the bottle's empty.

03:45.642 --> 03:46.476
That's all?

03:46.559 --> 03:50.647
Come and see me next week.
But your chest should be clear by Friday.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.568
I don't know how we coped
before you came here, doctor.

03:55.777 --> 03:58.446
Magic powders. My Lord.

03:58.529 --> 03:59.697
It's not magic.

04:00.031 --> 04:04.702
It's nothing but things we used to know,
that we forgot or lost over the years.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.579
No foot skin required.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.508
-Mrs. Lisa Tepes?
-Yes?

04:19.676 --> 04:20.802
You go on home now.

04:40.571 --> 04:43.449
I am an emissary
of the Archbishop of Targoviste.

04:43.783 --> 04:48.037
Do I understand correctly that you serve
as a physic to this community?

04:48.121 --> 04:49.914
I'm a doctor, yes.

04:50.915 --> 04:54.043
Can I help you? Is the Archbishop ill?

04:54.585 --> 04:56.254
You know what to look for.

05:00.383 --> 05:04.220
What? What do you need?
Tell me, I'll gladly give it to you.

05:04.595 --> 05:07.432
-Silence.
-I will not be silent.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.309
Just let me help.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.185
With Satan's tools?

05:13.062 --> 05:14.314
I don't think so.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.481
Excuse me?

05:16.899 --> 05:18.359
Here, Your Eminence.

05:23.489 --> 05:24.741
Satan's tools.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.035
Make fire. Clean it out.

05:27.118 --> 05:27.952
What?

05:28.619 --> 05:32.957
We were told something was wrong here.
It seems she was telling the truth.

05:33.416 --> 05:37.253
What are you doing here, that you need
to subject the good people of this land

05:37.336 --> 05:39.589
to such fearsome engines?

05:39.672 --> 05:41.049
I don't understand.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.508
Look around you!

05:43.342 --> 05:47.388
Do you pretend that these things
are not witchcraft and alchemy?

05:49.348 --> 05:51.142
It moves on its own!

05:52.393 --> 05:53.728
What is this?

05:53.811 --> 05:55.021
It's medicine.

05:55.104 --> 05:58.983
How can engines of the devil
be physic, woman?

05:59.067 --> 06:00.943
It's old knowledge, that's all.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.863
Sciences from older times,
lost to history.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.949
I have-- I mean, I've studied times past,

06:07.033 --> 06:10.912
and learned ways to serve our people
more effectively. That's all.

06:13.706 --> 06:14.540
Paganism.

06:15.917 --> 06:21.005
No. It's just science.
It has nothing to do with any god or--

06:21.089 --> 06:22.840
Nothing to do with God?

06:22.924 --> 06:24.675
No, that's not what I meant.

06:25.259 --> 06:29.472
Take her to the cathedral at Targoviste.
There shall be an Inquisition.

06:29.555 --> 06:30.848
After she's interned,

06:31.641 --> 06:35.937
you may take some alms to she
who was the wise woman of this village.

06:36.896 --> 06:42.527
Tell her that her good deed will,
well, carry her into heaven.

06:43.611 --> 06:47.573
Destroy everything in this room.
Let no trace of her magic remain.

06:48.407 --> 06:51.202
Please.
Please, you don't know what you're doing.

06:51.285 --> 06:55.706
I know exactly what I'm doing.
I am saving Wallachia from witches.

06:55.998 --> 07:01.462
No, listen, please. You don't know what
you'll bring upon yourself if you harm me.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.297
You threaten me?

07:03.589 --> 07:08.761
Listen. Just let me go.
I'll leave. You'll never see me again.

07:09.178 --> 07:11.973
I can't promise your safety
if you harm me.

07:12.056 --> 07:15.017
You dare menace me with Satan?

07:15.393 --> 07:18.062
Get her out of here
before I strike her dead.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.188
Not Satan!

07:19.730 --> 07:23.818
If you anger him, he's worse.
Because he's real.

07:23.985 --> 07:27.447
Please! He's come so far.
Don't make him do it.

07:28.239 --> 07:31.117
No, don't make him kill you all! Please!

09:14.762 --> 09:16.639
Stand up like a man.

09:41.706 --> 09:42.999
My generals.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.586
We prosecute a good war.

09:47.295 --> 09:48.671
In killing my wife,

09:48.921 --> 09:52.883
humanity has proven to me
that they don't deserve Wallachia.

09:53.801 --> 09:57.555
Wallachia will now become our seat.

09:59.348 --> 10:01.767
We will scour them off the land.

10:03.519 --> 10:06.063
We will continue to use the night hordes,

10:06.355 --> 10:09.942
all the creatures of terror
that humanity once drove away.

10:11.986 --> 10:15.948
Afterwards, I think
I will give Wallachia to them.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.743
Perhaps that will be better.

10:23.164 --> 10:27.835
Hector, Isaac, present me with plans
for our next steps today.

10:30.087 --> 10:33.215
The only two humans in your inner court,

10:33.424 --> 10:36.510
and they are the ones
who will plan our next attack?

10:38.679 --> 10:43.267
The only two generals in my court
who are not driven by thirst.

10:44.185 --> 10:48.314
The only two who are bound
by loyalty and intellect.

10:48.773 --> 10:53.361
True, they are not vampires
like you and I, Godbrand.

10:54.445 --> 10:57.323
And that is why I trust them.

10:58.449 --> 11:02.912
For we are about the business
of wiping humanity from the Earth...

11:04.080 --> 11:06.916
and they still stand with me.

11:16.258 --> 11:18.260
What the hell was that?

11:18.677 --> 11:23.391
He summons us from all over the world,
tells us it's war,

11:23.808 --> 11:27.770
we're finally putting the screws
to the livestock and taking over,

11:28.104 --> 11:29.605
and now this?

11:29.939 --> 11:32.983
Turning the whole thing over
to a couple of humans?

11:34.026 --> 11:35.277
What is this shit?

11:35.486 --> 11:38.948
-Hey! Where are you two going?
-We're going to talk to him.

11:39.031 --> 11:42.201
Why would he want to talk to you
rather than me?

11:43.035 --> 11:45.955
Perhaps he wants to meet
with his own kind.

11:46.038 --> 11:49.708
Godbrand, you've never met anything
you didn't kill, fuck,

11:49.792 --> 11:51.419
or make a boat out of.

11:51.502 --> 11:56.173
I don't understand why our lord doesn't
tie you up outside with the animals.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.384
Bigot!

11:59.427 --> 12:02.513
I like boats. I'm a fucking Viking.

12:02.596 --> 12:04.640
We're supposed to make boats
out of things.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.147
Master?

12:11.981 --> 12:13.649
Hector. Isaac.

12:14.358 --> 12:15.401
You may approach.

12:16.110 --> 12:19.155
We are honored by your faith in us.

12:19.738 --> 12:23.576
But to serve you correctly,
we have to ask--

12:23.784 --> 12:24.618
Why us?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.750
Did you hear Godbrand down there?

12:32.960 --> 12:34.545
"Livestock," he said.

12:36.046 --> 12:38.340
So many of my kindred are the same.

12:40.259 --> 12:43.846
They can no longer conceive of humans
as thinking beings.

12:45.764 --> 12:46.682
Just livestock.

12:48.767 --> 12:51.562
It's the privilege of our condition,
I suppose.

12:51.645 --> 12:55.816
You can't hate livestock.
They are simply what they are.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.487
Grazing animals to be slaughtered.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.531
But you two are different.

13:03.824 --> 13:08.704
You are human. You are not looking
at the scouring of humanity from the Earth

13:09.038 --> 13:12.166
as an opportunity
to get the livestock under control,

13:12.458 --> 13:16.545
and to fill stables
and abattoirs and pantries.

13:17.963 --> 13:21.258
You... hate your species.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.220
You hate humans.

13:25.513 --> 13:28.474
You have a focus and clarity
that the others lack.

13:29.683 --> 13:32.228
You understand that humans think...

13:33.562 --> 13:36.732
and scheme, and betray.

13:37.733 --> 13:41.946
You understand why they all must die.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.742
Yes. This is the work we were born for.

13:47.993 --> 13:48.827
Thank you.

13:49.912 --> 13:50.746
Yes.

13:51.872 --> 13:55.751
Thank you for clarifying, Master.
We will try to direct the war accordingly.

13:57.253 --> 14:00.631
I only hope
your generals will listen to us.

14:00.714 --> 14:03.717
They will have no choice. They obey me.

14:04.510 --> 14:09.431
You are my chosen authors of the war,
and so, they will obey you.

14:10.474 --> 14:11.725
The matter is closed.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.352
Of course.

14:22.653 --> 14:26.574
I never wanted you, Hector.
You sicken me. Do you understand?

14:26.782 --> 14:29.869
The moment you came out of me,
I knew you were wrong.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.413
Alchemy is for money and power, boy.

14:32.496 --> 14:36.292
Money and power and buying our safety
are all that matters.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.920
Stop whining about cruelty.
This is the world.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.089
This is the way things are.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.049
Now, get away from me.

14:44.383 --> 14:47.803
Hector? Hector, unlock this door at once!

14:48.971 --> 14:51.140
Are you burning something out there?

15:01.567 --> 15:03.027
I understand completely.

15:05.571 --> 15:09.909
It's going to be all right.
We're going to kill them all for you.

15:10.701 --> 15:11.827
They will suffer.

15:13.078 --> 15:16.206
The suffering doesn't matter to me
anymore, Isaac.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.084
Only the death.

15:20.794 --> 15:22.630
Only the death matters now.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.542
Your people are going to be fine.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.545
I know. And I know they have to do it.

16:45.254 --> 16:48.841
Other towns need their aid.
And to have their stories saved.

16:49.883 --> 16:54.013
-I'm not worried about them.
-You're worried about yourself, Sypha.

16:54.096 --> 16:57.641
You've always been with family.
You've never traveled alone.

16:58.225 --> 17:03.063
Never. Isn't it silly? They're heading
into who knows what danger,

17:03.397 --> 17:09.403
and I'm standing here sad and angry
because they're together, and I'm alone.

17:12.823 --> 17:16.910
This is where you're supposed to tell me
that I'm not alone, Belmont.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.622
You are really not very good at this.

17:20.873 --> 17:25.794
I learned to travel alone early in life.
Maybe I just got too used to it.

17:26.336 --> 17:27.838
You had a family, though?

17:28.297 --> 17:30.924
Not much of one, and not for long.

17:31.925 --> 17:32.843
Okay, look.

17:33.302 --> 17:37.264
I know a little bit
about what you're feeling. I'm sorry.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.516
But we have a thing to do now.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.644
All I can do is try and make sure
it doesn't get you killed,

17:42.728 --> 17:47.399
-so you can see your family again.
-That's your encouraging talk?

17:48.567 --> 17:51.487
Or you get killed
and they get eaten in the forest

17:51.570 --> 17:54.114
so none of you have to be sad. How's that?

17:54.823 --> 17:58.952
I was right about you the first time,
you know. You are rude.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.121
I've been called worse.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.332
Oh, I'm just getting started.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.478
Alucard, they called me.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.357
The opposite of you.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.278
Mother never liked that.
Did you know that?

18:34.780 --> 18:37.908
She hated the idea
that I might define myself by you.

18:38.992 --> 18:40.619
Even in opposition to you.

18:42.788 --> 18:46.667
She loved us both, enough that
she wanted us to be our own people,

18:47.459 --> 18:48.919
living our own lives...

18:50.212 --> 18:52.089
making our own choices.

18:53.966 --> 18:59.304
And so, here I am... choosing
to honor my mother by killing my father.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.100
No longer Adrian Tepes.

19:04.476 --> 19:09.064
Choosing to be Alucard of Wallachia,
the name of my mother's people.

19:12.609 --> 19:13.694
I'm sorry, Mother.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.123
And so, we begin again.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.130
Little Cezar, what are you doing?

19:36.967 --> 19:40.762
It's not really doing much, Hector.
It's dead.

19:41.597 --> 19:45.225
You really don't understand
the act of forging. He's not dead.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.686
We make life from death here.

19:47.936 --> 19:50.189
And you make soldiers for Dracula,

19:50.731 --> 19:55.319
which is one reason why
he invests so much in you, despite your...

19:56.570 --> 19:57.988
humanity.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.532
What do you want, Godbrand?

20:01.575 --> 20:07.539
I actually came to apologize
for my outburst in the War Hall.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.499
Excellent apology.

20:09.583 --> 20:13.712
Dracula brought us all here
to fight his war, Hector.

20:14.254 --> 20:16.590
All the vampires under his reign.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.426
The war. Not his war.

20:19.968 --> 20:22.512
It's just somewhat galling

20:22.596 --> 20:26.683
to have him look
to the two humans in the room first.

20:26.767 --> 20:30.979
I should have held my tongue,
so, I apologize.

20:31.563 --> 20:32.773
Accepted.

20:32.856 --> 20:38.070
But the other generals and my subordinates
have some questions.

20:39.112 --> 20:42.574
Hector, do you think
this war is going well?

20:43.116 --> 20:45.577
-We're hardly losing.
-No, of course not.

20:45.786 --> 20:52.125
But it seems chaotic, undirected,
as if we were lashing out at humanity

20:52.209 --> 20:55.379
without any real plan
beyond wild destruction.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.632
I think wild destruction is what he wants.

20:59.132 --> 21:01.260
There should be order. Right?

21:01.927 --> 21:05.055
Even in the removal of a species
from a place,

21:05.389 --> 21:08.642
wars have order,
plans, and maps, and lines.

21:08.725 --> 21:10.852
It could be done in less of a...

21:12.521 --> 21:15.107
It could be done more carefully.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.445
There is more bloodshed than I would like.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.365
I don't love the rest of humanity.

21:23.782 --> 21:28.578
I don't wanna share a world with them,
but... the suffering...

21:32.291 --> 21:35.585
-The last of the dead from Gresit?

21:36.003 --> 21:39.256
The night hordes took as many victims
as they could for the forges.

21:43.760 --> 21:47.014
This will do.
If there are any left, take them to Isaac.

21:55.772 --> 22:00.110
The Devil Forgemaster at work again,
raising the dead.

22:00.193 --> 22:04.531

22:05.824 --> 22:08.827
If you'll excuse me, Godbrand,
I have work to do.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.300
He's moving the castle again.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.010
Yes.

22:25.677 --> 22:27.095
His wonders to perform.
