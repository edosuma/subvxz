WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.269
<i>Previously on Dracula...</i>

00:04.271 --> 00:05.504
I do not need to see your offer.

00:05.506 --> 00:06.605
My interests are not for sale.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.207
At any price.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.509
Mr. Grayson has offered me
a position in his firm.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.677
I want you to tell me

00:11.679 --> 00:13.345
everything you know
about Lord Laurent.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.713
Everything you need to know
you can find out

00:14.715 --> 00:19.218
at 10:00 p.m.
at the Swinburne Club.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.252
What do you want?

00:20.254 --> 00:22.254
I presume you have no objection

00:22.256 --> 00:23.288
to my deployment of the seers.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.824
There is a vampire in London.

00:25.826 --> 00:28.827
You shall find him forthwith.

00:28.829 --> 00:31.263
He detected them
and then employed

00:31.265 --> 00:33.298
some kind of countermeasure.

00:33.300 --> 00:36.468
I will track him,
and I will destroy him.

00:36.470 --> 00:39.304
Why engage Harker to bring
the woman into your orbit?

00:39.306 --> 00:41.807
Surely you have the power
to simply take her.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.475
To turn her
into such as I am,

00:43.477 --> 00:45.544
it would be an abomination.

02:01.221 --> 02:03.422
So it is written,

02:03.424 --> 02:06.525
and so it shall be done.

02:45.398 --> 02:47.733
Ilona.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.442
Ilona.

03:18.631 --> 03:19.631
Where am I?

03:19.633 --> 03:20.732
Why am I not dead?

03:20.734 --> 03:23.435
This is the price of your defiance.

03:23.437 --> 03:26.738
Using the power of the god
you denounced,

03:26.740 --> 03:29.341
Ordo Draco has made a monster.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.310
Thou art condemned,

03:31.312 --> 03:36.315
condemned to endless night.

03:38.885 --> 03:44.523
Yah!

03:44.525 --> 03:47.292
Vlad Tepes is condemned

03:47.294 --> 03:51.296
to be undead.

04:26.799 --> 04:29.034
I had no idea you played, sir.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.035
It's been over a century

04:30.037 --> 04:32.371
Since I last put fingers to keys.

04:35.709 --> 04:38.744
I was thinking
about Lady Jayne Wetherby

04:38.746 --> 04:42.481
and her decidedly unwholesome
avocation.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.916
Really? Which one, sir?

04:46.920 --> 04:49.354
Her vampire hunting, of course.

04:49.356 --> 04:51.290
It stretches credulity to think

04:51.292 --> 04:53.091
she's unaffiliated with the Order.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.093
I would tend to agree, sir.

04:55.095 --> 04:59.898
But then she is a female.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.801
I suppose I shall have
to ascertain it

05:02.803 --> 05:06.305
one way or the other.

05:06.307 --> 05:07.873
What's that?

05:07.875 --> 05:10.742
Ah, yes, written confirmation

05:10.744 --> 05:12.711
from Lord Laurent's solicitor.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.846
Congratulations, sir.

05:14.848 --> 05:17.049
You are now
a majority stockholder

05:17.051 --> 05:19.618
of British Imperial Coolant.

06:22.148 --> 06:24.649
Jonathan. Oh.

06:24.651 --> 06:27.519
Good morning.
You look dreadful.

06:27.521 --> 06:30.922
Pack your trunk and we shall go.

06:30.924 --> 06:34.092
Mother decamped for paris
and left me on my own,

06:34.094 --> 06:36.762
and you know
how much I hate that.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.964
So, if the cure for my
loneliness and your broken heart

06:38.966 --> 06:41.933
are the same thing...

06:41.935 --> 06:43.001
How did you know?

06:43.003 --> 06:44.069
Dearest Mina,

06:44.071 --> 06:45.904
Do not shed a single tear

06:45.906 --> 06:47.973
for Jonathan Harker.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.008
Honestly, there's no point
in wasting a single minute more

06:50.010 --> 06:50.976
thinking about what an awful twit

06:50.978 --> 06:53.178
He turned out to be.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.982
Not when you could be having fun
with me instead.

07:10.897 --> 07:13.732
Dr. Murray,
I have two young relatives

07:13.734 --> 07:15.567
under my charge,
sharp, young minds,

07:15.569 --> 07:18.103
But lately they've experienced
a great psychic strain.

07:18.105 --> 07:22.808
I understand, in your capacity
as director of this institution,

07:22.810 --> 07:26.211
that you've had the privilege
of serving as an alienist

07:26.213 --> 07:29.080
To certain individuals of high renown.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.650
I have treated a number
of public figures.

07:31.652 --> 07:34.653
You understand of course
that I can't divulge...

07:34.655 --> 07:36.855
No, no, your reputation

07:36.857 --> 07:38.490
for discretion precedes you.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.725
Which is why I'm here.

07:40.727 --> 07:43.061
Not for myself naturally,

07:43.063 --> 07:45.497
But for close relations

07:45.499 --> 07:49.601
who wish
to remain anonymous.

07:49.603 --> 07:52.571
Please, how may I be of service?

07:53.806 --> 07:55.006
You should be able to meet
our order

07:55.008 --> 07:56.675
without a problem, Mr. Worth.

07:56.677 --> 08:00.712
Are you suggesting we dedicate
the entirety of our operation

08:00.714 --> 08:01.980
to the needs of a single client?

08:01.982 --> 08:04.516
No.

08:04.518 --> 08:07.018
But I think he is.

08:07.020 --> 08:11.189
Get out of my office now,
both of you.

08:16.162 --> 08:20.065
Very well.
Though I must regretfully

08:20.067 --> 08:24.035
inform you that your employment
here is terminated,

08:24.037 --> 08:25.971
Effective immediately.

08:25.973 --> 08:29.040
You don't have the authority
to dismiss me.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.643
You're nothing more
than a rich man's novelty

08:31.645 --> 08:33.178
I wouldn't even let
into my home.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.046
Now hold on a minute.
You have no right to speak...

08:35.048 --> 08:36.815
As a majority shareholder

08:36.817 --> 08:40.784
of British Imperial Lubrication
and Coolant Co., limited,

08:40.787 --> 08:44.089
Alexander Grayson
is now your employer.

08:44.091 --> 08:48.026
When I speak,
I speak with his authority.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.829
I'll give you a second chance
to do as you're told.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.331
Have I made myself clear?

08:59.539 --> 09:02.173
Yes.

09:04.110 --> 09:06.678
Sir.

09:10.316 --> 09:13.184
In future, I'd appreciate it
if you tried to earn

09:13.186 --> 09:16.321
Mr. Grayson's trust,
not to mention generosity,

09:16.323 --> 09:19.691
and I'd start by sharing
your undivided attention

09:19.693 --> 09:20.926
during business meetings.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.594
I'm sorry.
There's no excuse.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.062
I provided a list of individuals

09:24.064 --> 09:26.598
Mr. Grayson
would very much like you

09:26.600 --> 09:28.667
to foster friendships with.

09:28.669 --> 09:31.603
I'm sure you recognize
most of the names on the list.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.572
And, Harker...

09:33.574 --> 09:37.609
Never again presume
to defend me to anyone.

09:41.147 --> 09:44.883
If you wish, I'd be happy
to mix a stimulant.

09:44.885 --> 09:49.588
Now may I inquire
as to your client's name?

09:49.590 --> 09:52.390
I'd rather not say.

09:52.392 --> 09:57.128
Please, doctor,
indulge a humble academic.

10:00.833 --> 10:04.336
Well, professor,
I suppose I can rely

10:04.338 --> 10:06.871
on your discretion?

10:10.009 --> 10:13.778
She is Lady Jayne Wetherby.

10:16.716 --> 10:19.050
Ah.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.987
I see. I see.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.956
Our huntswoman is seeking
a new drug for her seers.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.225
Yes.

10:27.227 --> 10:30.996
I'm certain of it.

10:30.998 --> 10:34.199
Give it to her.

10:36.235 --> 10:41.106
Well, if you insist,
I'll concoct a serum

10:41.108 --> 10:44.242
of inadequate potency.

10:44.244 --> 10:48.179
And force our enemy to seek
a new solution elsewhere,

10:48.181 --> 10:49.981
beyond our control.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.050
Well done, Van Helsing.

10:52.052 --> 10:55.020
Short-sighted and foolish.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.989
I suppose you have a better plan?

10:57.991 --> 11:01.126
If Grayson brings off
his geomagnetic scheme,

11:01.128 --> 11:02.827
the Order's oil
and petroleum holdings

11:02.829 --> 11:03.995
Won't be worth the paper
they're written on.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.464
I am well aware
of the threat he poses

11:06.466 --> 11:07.766
to all of us.

11:07.768 --> 11:11.202
To sell him your shares
in british imperial coolant?

11:11.204 --> 11:12.804
Had I a choice in the matter,

11:12.806 --> 11:14.706
I would never have agreed
to his terms.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.442
He threatened you.

11:19.912 --> 11:22.681
There is no protection, none,

11:22.683 --> 11:25.150
for any brother who violates
the principal oath.

11:27.787 --> 11:30.055
If you have anything to say
to me in your defense,

11:30.057 --> 11:32.691
I suggest you do so now,
or stand before your brothers

11:32.693 --> 11:35.860
and suffer
the punishment proscribed.

13:55.634 --> 13:58.369
Kill me.

13:58.371 --> 14:02.941
Please. Kill me.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.543
Shh.

15:06.338 --> 15:08.640
Grayson.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.150
This way, please.

15:19.152 --> 15:23.288
Here we are. Madam.

15:27.627 --> 15:32.730
Daniel, is that
Alexander Grayson's man?

15:32.732 --> 15:34.232
Jonathan Harker.

15:34.234 --> 15:37.302
Yes, father,
that's him.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.203
Winston.

15:39.205 --> 15:42.273
Will you send a bottle of Bordeaux
over to that young man

15:42.275 --> 15:44.275
dining on his own, Mr. Harker,

15:44.277 --> 15:47.278
with our compliments?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.247
Is there a problem?

15:49.249 --> 15:52.250
No, sir.
It's just Mr. Harker directed us

15:52.252 --> 15:55.186
to send this over
with his compliments.

15:55.188 --> 15:59.724
Hmm, Latour 1890.

16:03.062 --> 16:04.195
We shall make a full circuit,

16:04.197 --> 16:05.363
starting at the Savoy

16:05.365 --> 16:07.198
and arriving fashionably late

16:07.200 --> 16:08.733
at the officers' club ball,

16:08.735 --> 16:10.501
where the men shall be delicious,

16:10.503 --> 16:13.304
if a little too well-behaved.

16:13.306 --> 16:18.242
Lucy...
When you went to the house,

16:18.244 --> 16:22.447
are you sure
you didn't see Jonathan?

16:22.449 --> 16:23.648
No, Mina.

16:23.650 --> 16:27.218
Not a note, not a card, nothing.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.454
No doubt he's already found
some silly little cow

16:29.456 --> 16:33.458
who fits his description
of a proper English wife.

16:36.528 --> 16:41.366
What do we do
with these delicious officers?

16:44.070 --> 16:48.773
Ladies.

17:00.786 --> 17:05.522
Where are you going?

17:05.525 --> 17:06.758
You know I have to.

17:06.760 --> 17:09.093
To steal away
like a thief in the night?

17:09.095 --> 17:10.560
The die is cast.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.296
Then we'll run away.

17:12.298 --> 17:14.699
We'll run as far
and as fast as we can

17:14.701 --> 17:18.236
to a safe haven
beyond the reach of the Order.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.537
There's no such place, Daniel.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.239
And you know it.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.741
- Then we'll simply come clean.
- Are you mad?

17:23.742 --> 17:25.209
What of my reputation?

17:25.211 --> 17:26.544
I will not shirk death

17:26.546 --> 17:30.248
only to see my family's legacy
compromised.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.616
I signed my death warrant

17:31.618 --> 17:34.318
the moment that I capitulated
to that American.

17:34.320 --> 17:37.655
I knew this when I did it.

17:37.657 --> 17:41.793
And I would do it again.

17:45.364 --> 17:49.267
Stop!

17:49.269 --> 17:51.502
Finally.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.438
We've been waiting here
all night.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.676
Sir, the sun.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.878
Just a moment more.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.515
What is it?

18:04.517 --> 18:06.584
Sir.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.319
I want to see her face

18:08.321 --> 18:10.188
When she reads the card.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.090
Are they from Jonathan?

18:12.092 --> 18:14.158
- No.
- Oh, let me see.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.427
I'm sorry, sir.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.129
Damn!

18:18.131 --> 18:20.264
"When it comes to dreams,
one might falter,

18:20.266 --> 18:22.266
"but the only way to fail
is to abandon them.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.102
Congratulations."

18:24.104 --> 18:27.105
It's unsigned.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.173
Who do you think
might have sent them?

18:29.175 --> 18:32.310
I haven't the slightest.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.178
Okay.

18:59.204 --> 19:01.339
Have you made any progress
with the solar vaccine?

19:01.341 --> 19:03.908
Not while devising the serum
for Lady Jayne, no.

19:03.910 --> 19:07.278
How long must I spend
skulking in the shadows?

19:07.280 --> 19:09.380
I want to walk in the sun
like any other man.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.249
You will never be
like any other man.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.384
You would do well to remember that.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.820
I've increased the duration
of the vaccine

19:15.822 --> 19:17.321
to three minutes and 12 seconds.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.323
Ah!

19:19.325 --> 19:22.393
- Three minutes.
- And 12 seconds.

19:24.329 --> 19:27.298
You leave me just enough time
to have a cup of tea

19:27.300 --> 19:29.967
before I burst into flames.

20:35.602 --> 20:38.536
Brother Stephen James Laurent,

20:38.538 --> 20:40.271
did you place your own interests

20:40.273 --> 20:42.640
before those
of this most august order?

20:45.444 --> 20:48.446
I did.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.649
The punishment is proscribed
within these pages.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.918
So it is written...

20:53.920 --> 20:57.521
And so it shall be done.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.523
The sentence
has been handed down

20:59.525 --> 21:01.659
from generation to generation.

21:01.661 --> 21:04.762
Will you accept the blade?

21:06.798 --> 21:09.300
I will.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.407
What are you thinking?

23:37.682 --> 23:41.085
Ah, you...
you need more absinthe.

23:41.087 --> 23:44.989
Perhaps, but by way
of careful study and experiment,

23:44.991 --> 23:47.458
I may have discovered my limit.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.560
Beautiful and witty.

23:49.562 --> 23:52.463
Hmm, I'm not sure
whether to write a poem

23:52.465 --> 23:54.198
or paint your portrait.

23:54.200 --> 23:57.668
I wonder, how many women
have you flattered

23:57.670 --> 24:00.237
with paper and canvas?

24:00.239 --> 24:02.840
You're the last one.
I promise.

24:02.842 --> 24:07.878
My way of contact with reality

24:07.880 --> 24:10.047
is through a limited aperture.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.483
Our transfluence takes place

24:12.485 --> 24:16.587
through one small...

24:16.589 --> 24:18.189
opening.

24:20.026 --> 24:22.259
I amuse you?

24:22.261 --> 24:24.228
Do women really fall for that?

24:24.230 --> 24:28.199
"Transfluence."

24:28.201 --> 24:29.900
How superior you are.

24:29.902 --> 24:32.069
A woman of your means

24:32.071 --> 24:34.171
slumming the lower depths.

24:34.173 --> 24:39.243
Observing us like we're animals
at the zoo.

24:39.245 --> 24:42.580
Ah.

24:45.584 --> 24:47.818
You see there are no bars here.

24:47.820 --> 24:53.090
And we are not caged.

24:55.695 --> 25:00.297
All right. I'm fine. Fine.

25:08.707 --> 25:10.841
Move!

25:13.745 --> 25:15.980
Mr. Grayson.

25:21.153 --> 25:24.822
Thank you
for my rescue.

25:24.824 --> 25:28.158
It was nothing.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.995
But what brought you here?

25:32.531 --> 25:35.032
This place is notorious
for its parties.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.167
I like the music.

25:37.169 --> 25:40.337
Hmm.

25:40.339 --> 25:43.707
You're troubled.

25:43.709 --> 25:46.810
- No.
- Tell me.

25:46.812 --> 25:49.079
Please.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.948
It's Jonathan.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.117
Harker?

25:53.119 --> 25:56.353
I can't believe
he'd do anything to hurt you.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.822
But he did.

25:58.824 --> 26:02.693
He said the most horrible things,
and I walked away,

26:02.695 --> 26:04.762
and we haven't seen
each other since.

26:04.764 --> 26:07.765
I don't know how to fix it.

26:11.970 --> 26:14.905
You know, bohemian nightlife

26:14.907 --> 26:18.342
is a poor substitute for happiness.

26:21.146 --> 26:24.348
Sometimes the people
and places we are meant for

26:24.350 --> 26:26.984
take us by surprise.

26:26.986 --> 26:28.752
Well, there's a <i>tableau vivant.</i>

26:28.754 --> 26:31.655
Heathcliff and Cathy
on the moors.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.628
It's getting late.

26:37.630 --> 26:40.331
- May I see you ladies home?
- No. Thank you.

26:40.333 --> 26:43.267
My carriage is waiting.

26:43.269 --> 26:47.271
Miss Murray, Miss Westenra.

26:47.273 --> 26:51.909
Thank you... Mr. Grayson.

27:04.723 --> 27:07.324
I had lunch with several of the men
on your list yesterday...

27:07.326 --> 27:10.260
Davenport and son,

27:10.262 --> 27:13.130
Lord Rothcroft, General Shaw.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.765
I see. Anyone else?

27:14.767 --> 27:17.267
A Mr. Browning.

27:17.269 --> 27:21.038
- Browning?
- Yes, he was at your party.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.807
Are you sure?

27:23.809 --> 27:26.076
Yes, quite.

27:26.078 --> 27:29.146
Now a mutual friend has told me,

27:29.148 --> 27:31.348
in complete discretion of course,

27:31.350 --> 27:35.152
that you have recently broken
from a young lady.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.453
Her name escapes me.

27:36.455 --> 27:37.788
Mina Murray.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.923
Charming gal.

27:39.925 --> 27:43.994
I'd rather not discuss it,
if you don't mind.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.796
But I do.

27:45.798 --> 27:48.198
If only to prevent you
from turning my study

27:48.200 --> 27:51.835
Into a funeral parlor.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.704
I'm sorry.

28:04.883 --> 28:08.419
I've known Miss Murray...

28:08.421 --> 28:12.723
Mina... For a long time.

28:12.725 --> 28:14.725
She's always been very stubborn.

28:14.727 --> 28:19.697
She insists on continuing
her studies despite the fact

28:19.699 --> 28:21.732
that I now have the means
and every intention

28:21.734 --> 28:24.368
of supporting her as my wife.

28:24.370 --> 28:27.371
I understand.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.473
- You do?
- Uh-huh.

28:29.475 --> 28:32.076
I understand that you are a fool.

28:34.746 --> 28:37.748
How can a man who wishes
to defy social convention

28:37.750 --> 28:40.150
And rise above his station

28:40.152 --> 28:42.853
Deny the same thing
in the woman he loves?

28:46.157 --> 28:47.424
You're calling me a hypocrite.

28:47.426 --> 28:48.859
No, Harker.

28:48.861 --> 28:50.961
I'm calling you a fool.

28:50.963 --> 28:53.430
But you are a man in love.

28:56.134 --> 29:00.270
And they are very often
the same thing.

29:00.272 --> 29:03.807
Finish up. Go home.

29:24.195 --> 29:27.564
Mm.

29:29.834 --> 29:31.135
You're up.

29:31.137 --> 29:32.803
Thinking.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.938
Oh. "thinking."

29:34.940 --> 29:38.008
I do think, you know,
every so often.

29:39.111 --> 29:43.213
And what are you thinking about?

29:43.215 --> 29:44.581
You.

29:44.583 --> 29:47.818
You inspire me to...

29:47.820 --> 29:51.054
I don't know, greater independence,
I suppose.

29:51.056 --> 29:53.190
What time is it?

29:53.192 --> 29:55.192
2:00.

29:55.194 --> 29:58.295
We gave half the day to the night.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.831
- 2:00?
- Mina, what is it?

30:00.833 --> 30:04.434
I missed
professor Van Helsing's class.

30:10.327 --> 30:12.843
Willow bark to ease
the pounding in your head.

30:12.845 --> 30:17.181
It tastes awful,
but it will work wonders.

30:17.183 --> 30:19.016
Thank you, professor.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.324
Miss Murray,

30:27.326 --> 30:30.460
am I wasting my time with you?

30:32.564 --> 30:35.866
There are dreams we must fight for.

30:35.868 --> 30:38.902
If you want to advance
beyond the boundaries

30:38.904 --> 30:40.871
society has made for you,

30:40.873 --> 30:42.606
You must fight.

30:42.608 --> 30:45.142
You're not wasting your time.

30:45.144 --> 30:47.911
Give me a second chance,
and I will prove it to you.

30:55.587 --> 30:58.589
Return here tomorrow morning
at 5:00 a.m. sharp.

30:58.591 --> 31:02.392
You will report to me
as my assistant for the term.

31:22.080 --> 31:24.982
The serum for Lady Jayne's seers
is ready.

31:29.554 --> 31:33.657
We'll track their power
to its source,

31:33.659 --> 31:37.928
And there will be a plague
upon this city.

31:45.937 --> 31:48.038
Take this directly
to the address as written.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.072
Don't dawdle.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.474
If you return within an hour

31:50.476 --> 31:51.575
with a signed receipt of delivery,

31:51.577 --> 31:53.210
A second shilling
will be your reward.

31:53.212 --> 31:56.513
Go on.
Yes, sir.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.482
Yes, sir.

32:18.436 --> 32:21.371
Is the stimulant working, sister?

32:21.373 --> 32:24.174
Can you see the vampire?

32:30.748 --> 32:33.717
I can see. It's working.

33:09.654 --> 33:12.789
The vampire.

33:12.791 --> 33:14.758
He's with her.

33:40.718 --> 33:43.820
Help me, I can't move.

33:47.558 --> 33:49.760
We've been poisoned.

34:02.640 --> 34:06.043
I see my serum has taken hold.

34:06.045 --> 34:08.712
By now you will
both be paralyzed.

34:12.617 --> 34:16.753
Do you have any idea...

34:19.257 --> 34:21.757
what it's like
to hear the screams

34:21.760 --> 34:25.529
of your wife and children?

34:31.735 --> 34:33.637
My children would be
in their 20s now.

34:33.639 --> 34:37.574
The Order burned them alive
for no other reason

34:37.576 --> 34:40.543
than to punish me
for my disobedience.

34:41.879 --> 34:44.514
I lost everything.

34:52.723 --> 34:54.891
The monster you seek,

34:54.893 --> 34:57.360
I cannot let you find him.

34:57.362 --> 34:59.663
Not as long
as he is of use to me.

34:59.665 --> 35:02.833
Until we've destroyed the Order
once and for all.

35:02.835 --> 35:07.604
I'm afraid traces of the drug

35:07.606 --> 35:10.807
will stay in your brain tissue
post-mortem.

35:10.809 --> 35:14.644
Since I'm the only man
in Britain

35:14.646 --> 35:16.613
who possesses the expertise

35:16.615 --> 35:19.249
to process and administer

35:19.251 --> 35:22.385
a non-lethal dose,

35:22.387 --> 35:24.754
I would fall under suspicion.

35:24.756 --> 35:26.656
This evidence I must destroy.

35:26.658 --> 35:31.394
It is unfortunate, but sometimes
science requires sacrifice.

35:38.503 --> 35:42.606
Don't worry. I will be quick.

35:56.655 --> 35:59.489
Coming.

36:08.299 --> 36:10.534
I'm sorry.

36:10.536 --> 36:11.835
For everything.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.638
It's my fault, not yours.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.306
I've been stubborn.

36:16.308 --> 36:18.241
I've been so obsessed
with chasing my own dreams

36:18.243 --> 36:20.243
that I never even took the time
to understand yours,

36:20.245 --> 36:21.778
And I do.

36:21.780 --> 36:25.882
But I now realize
you don't require my protection,

36:25.884 --> 36:27.484
and you are in no need of keeping.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.822
So, if.. if you could,

36:32.824 --> 36:35.892
just let me love you instead.

36:44.602 --> 36:47.804
Good evening, Miss Murray.

36:58.349 --> 37:01.418
Jonathan!

37:05.590 --> 37:09.492
You've forgotten
the most important thing.

37:09.494 --> 37:11.394
What?

37:11.396 --> 37:13.863
Marry me.

37:15.032 --> 37:18.001
Be my husband,
and I will be your wife.

37:26.677 --> 37:29.379
I wanted to ask you
so many times.

37:29.381 --> 37:31.915
I even bought a ring.

37:33.851 --> 37:36.486
Wait.

37:41.392 --> 37:44.027
May I?

38:21.766 --> 38:23.700
The oddest thing
happened to me today.

38:23.702 --> 38:27.671
Really, sir? Just one?

38:27.673 --> 38:30.540
I performed an act
which brought great joy

38:30.542 --> 38:32.575
to someone other than myself.

38:32.577 --> 38:34.844
Whom?

38:34.846 --> 38:37.914
Harker, Mina Murray.

38:37.916 --> 38:40.850
What exactly did you do?

38:40.852 --> 38:43.520
I guided the one back to the other.

38:43.522 --> 38:45.855
By the looks of it, they'll be wed.

38:45.857 --> 38:47.724
A good deed then.

38:47.726 --> 38:50.627
Yes.

38:50.629 --> 38:54.597
I should be horrified,

38:54.599 --> 38:57.834
But in truth, I can't say
I dislike this feeling.

38:57.836 --> 39:00.904
- And yet...
- And yet?

39:00.906 --> 39:03.907
Keeping your employee
and Miss Murray together

39:03.909 --> 39:07.877
keeps her in your orbit.

39:07.879 --> 39:11.948
Like gravity.
Close but not too close.

39:11.950 --> 39:15.051
When it might be wiser
to let her go.

39:17.588 --> 39:20.023
Sometimes you're too smart
for your own good.

39:20.025 --> 39:24.994
It's like a millstone around my neck.

39:28.632 --> 39:31.167
On that first morning

39:31.169 --> 39:34.471
when they made me what I am,

39:34.473 --> 39:36.973
the sunlight burned my skin.

39:39.810 --> 39:42.712
I don't know how or why,

39:42.714 --> 39:45.048
but I knew
I would never be the same.

39:47.017 --> 39:49.919
What did you do?

39:49.921 --> 39:53.957
Ripped out the throat
of the bastard priest.

39:53.959 --> 39:59.529
So not a bad morning,
all things considered.

39:59.531 --> 40:01.831
I've had worse.

40:15.613 --> 40:17.147
How can this be?

40:17.149 --> 40:19.115
I don't know.

40:19.117 --> 40:21.084
It's unprecedented.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.620
To track the trackers...
It has never been done before.

40:23.622 --> 40:26.423
- It's a disaster.
- Oh, it's worse than that.

40:26.425 --> 40:29.592
This is the work
of the vampire that I seek.

40:29.594 --> 40:31.728
Now that the seers are dead,

40:31.730 --> 40:35.598
he will much more easily
attract others of his kind.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.701
An abomination.

40:38.703 --> 40:42.972
Soon London will be crawling
with the vermin.

40:58.689 --> 41:03.026
Stephen.

41:44.935 --> 41:47.303
Daniel!

41:48.539 --> 41:50.507
Oh, my boy!

42:13.931 --> 42:17.634
Grayson.

42:17.636 --> 42:19.068
Grayson!
