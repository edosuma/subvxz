00:00.033 --> 00:02.341
Previously on "secrets and lies"...

00:02.360 --> 00:05.668
I'm Detective Andrea Cornell.
Please let go of the victim.

00:05.770 --> 00:07.403
She's my wife.

00:07.505 --> 00:09.232
Kate fell from the roof.

00:09.252 --> 00:11.715
I need to know if I'm
investigating a murder

00:11.817 --> 00:13.083
or if this was a suicide.

00:13.185 --> 00:14.551
My wife didn't kill herself.

00:14.653 --> 00:15.886
How can you be so sure?

00:15.988 --> 00:17.421
'Cause she was pregnant.

00:17.441 --> 00:19.256
Cornell thinks Kate was murdered.

00:19.358 --> 00:23.527
- You are the prime suspect.
- Kate didn't commit suicide.

00:23.629 --> 00:24.761
Someone killed her.

00:24.863 --> 00:27.178
Who would have pushed
my wife off the roof?

00:27.198 --> 00:28.632
Somebody was in here.

00:28.734 --> 00:30.467
Did you know she had a P.O. Box?

00:30.536 --> 00:32.369
Kate Warner died from a 12-story fall.

00:32.438 --> 00:34.271
This is a homicide.

00:34.373 --> 00:37.174
There were signs of separation
of the pelvic girdle.

00:37.194 --> 00:39.728
You didn't know your wife
had another man's baby?

00:39.748 --> 00:42.412
- I did not kill my wife.
- What about Steven Porter?

00:42.514 --> 00:44.715
I didn't mean to kill him.

00:44.817 --> 00:48.118
â™ª

00:50.189 --> 00:52.923
You publicly exposed
Eric's juvenile record

00:53.025 --> 00:55.158
at his wife's memorial.

00:55.260 --> 00:57.461
A record that was sealed and expunged.

00:57.563 --> 00:59.496
It no longer exists.

01:04.236 --> 01:08.338
Employees mentioned seeing
your wife with a black eye.

01:08.440 --> 01:10.207
You want to explain that?

01:10.309 --> 01:12.075
Kate's black eye was an accident.

01:12.177 --> 01:15.529
She was walking into the kitchen
when I opened the cupboard.

01:17.316 --> 01:20.016
Are you telling me that
your wife walked into a door?

01:20.119 --> 01:23.553
I know how it sounds,
but it's the truth.

01:23.655 --> 01:27.004
Why did you go up to
the roof, Mr. Warner?

01:31.330 --> 01:33.497
It was time for me to give my speech.

01:33.599 --> 01:35.966
I was nervous about it.

01:36.068 --> 01:38.668
Kate practiced with me
for weeks to prepare.

01:38.771 --> 01:41.905
She wrote down talking
points on 3x5 cards,

01:41.974 --> 01:43.907
told me to tell a few jokes.

01:44.009 --> 01:48.247
Kate couldn't tell a joke 'cause
she'd always blow the punch line.

01:48.961 --> 01:50.847
Anyway, the... the cards
were in her purse.

01:50.949 --> 01:53.342
When I couldn't find her in the office,

01:53.870 --> 01:58.088
I figured she'd be on the roof.
She liked it up there.

02:23.916 --> 02:28.952
But we didn't find any 3x5 cards
on the roof or by your wife.

02:30.956 --> 02:32.722
Why would I lie about this?

02:32.825 --> 02:34.925
Why does anybody lie, Mr. Warner?

02:35.027 --> 02:36.927
You think I killed my wife.

02:37.029 --> 02:39.062
I didn't.

02:39.164 --> 02:42.118
And I didn't kill Steven Porter either.

02:42.348 --> 02:46.022
Your juvenile record says you
had something to do with it.

02:47.906 --> 02:50.106
Porter was a star running back.

02:50.209 --> 02:52.943
He liked to bully,
and I was his favorite target.

02:53.045 --> 02:56.112
Finally, I couldn't take it anymore.

02:56.215 --> 03:01.451
So I took a swing at him.
One punch, and the guy died.

03:03.722 --> 03:06.269
No one knew Porter had a broken neck

03:06.289 --> 03:08.066
or how long he'd had that injury.

03:08.086 --> 03:11.094
Even the medical examiner couldn't tell.

03:11.196 --> 03:14.097
What the M.E. did say
was that Steven Porter's neck

03:14.199 --> 03:16.099
was likely broken playing football,

03:16.201 --> 03:19.102
and he could have died from
any sudden contact after that.

03:19.204 --> 03:21.071
You can read it in the transcripts.

03:21.173 --> 03:24.975
Well, as you said, counselor,
the transcripts no longer exist.

03:25.077 --> 03:28.476
Except for the ones
in my father's possession.

03:28.496 --> 03:31.886
I'll make sure we send it over.
Will that suffice?

03:34.653 --> 03:39.134
Did you know that your wife
withdrew $100,000 from the bank?

03:39.504 --> 03:41.358
Don't answer that.

03:41.460 --> 03:43.693
From your savings account, in cash.

03:46.039 --> 03:47.862
Excuse me.

03:57.209 --> 03:59.409
How you feeling? You okay?

04:02.073 --> 04:04.447
Honestly, I don't know.

04:04.550 --> 04:06.283
We'll be leaving soon.

04:06.385 --> 04:08.952
Sure doesn't feel like it.

04:09.054 --> 04:12.923
That man was Cornell's boss,
and he's telling her to back off.

04:14.889 --> 04:18.194
- Why would he do that?
- We have a lot of friends.

04:18.297 --> 04:19.894
I'm well aware,

04:20.185 --> 04:23.581
but they're making me look bad,
and I don't have anything to hide.

04:26.215 --> 04:28.197
You're free to leave.

04:35.280 --> 04:38.582
You already sent one
innocent man to prison.

04:38.684 --> 04:41.251
Don't be a repeat offender.

04:49.127 --> 04:50.727
It's gonna be fine.

04:50.796 --> 04:52.062
There's no way it can be.

04:52.164 --> 04:54.164
Tell me what I can do.
What do you need right now?

04:54.266 --> 04:58.034
Answers. Kate's dead,
and I keep finding out things

04:58.136 --> 04:59.970
about my relationship
that make me question...

05:00.072 --> 05:02.405
Eric, don't do that. Don't
pick apart your relationship

05:02.507 --> 05:03.773
when Kate is not here to defend it.

05:03.875 --> 05:06.242
She had a baby, Amanda. A baby.

05:06.345 --> 05:08.845
Where is it? Did it die?
Did she give it up for adoption?

05:08.947 --> 05:11.107
Who's the father, and where is he?

05:11.380 --> 05:14.517
$100,000.

05:15.688 --> 05:18.081
What is going on? Did you
know about any of this?

05:18.101 --> 05:22.025
No. But I know that she did not
take that money without a reason.

05:22.127 --> 05:25.908
- Then why not tell me about it?
- I don't know.

05:26.186 --> 05:28.432
All right. I-I got to find out.

06:24.840 --> 06:27.323
If... if that's all the space
I get after giving up my lease,

06:27.426 --> 06:28.591
we should talk.

06:28.727 --> 06:32.195
What, I gave you two
shelves, and... okay.

06:35.532 --> 06:37.361
That section.

06:37.942 --> 06:39.602
Why don't we just get a bigger place?

06:39.622 --> 06:41.883
No, not until we're ready
to start a family.

06:41.903 --> 06:44.841
- Uh-huh.
- Wait, I thought you wanted kids.

06:44.943 --> 06:46.643
Of course. Kids are great.

06:46.745 --> 06:48.745
Your place is... Yes, it's doable,

06:48.847 --> 06:51.715
but, um, the closet
is what's not gonna work.

06:51.817 --> 06:53.583
Why do you need more space than this?

06:53.685 --> 06:55.785
If you got rid of half of your stuff,

06:55.921 --> 06:58.421
- I'd have all the space I need.
- No, I need this.

06:58.523 --> 07:00.590
Okay.

07:00.692 --> 07:02.025
Okay. Compromise.

07:02.127 --> 07:05.395
You... you're moving. I'm not.

07:06.418 --> 07:08.058
Am I being pushy?

07:08.078 --> 07:09.899
I know your last girlfriend...

07:10.001 --> 07:13.336
Was certifiably crazy.

07:13.930 --> 07:17.474
- She hoarded clothes, too.
- Funny.

07:17.576 --> 07:19.509
At least you're honest.

07:19.611 --> 07:20.977
Why wouldn't I be?

07:21.079 --> 07:22.812
Lots of couples lie to each other.

07:22.914 --> 07:24.681
Well, in order for this to work,

07:25.264 --> 07:27.427
we have to tell each other the truth.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.186
Okay. I don't want to
give you half my closet.

08:29.623 --> 08:31.881
Come on, buddy. Open up.

08:31.983 --> 08:33.549
My hands are full.

08:48.166 --> 08:50.103
You've gone rogue.

08:50.123 --> 08:52.370
Why are you here?

08:52.652 --> 08:55.438
Thought you might need company.

08:56.177 --> 08:57.907
How long you planning on staying?

08:58.009 --> 09:03.513
As long as you need. A few days
to talk, listen, or just be quiet.

09:05.099 --> 09:07.183
I don't need a sitter.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.185
You need something.

09:14.450 --> 09:16.726
Um... I went through Kate's things

09:16.828 --> 09:19.062
to try and figure out
who the hell she was.

09:19.164 --> 09:20.563
Why?

09:20.665 --> 09:22.298
She was hiding things.

09:23.728 --> 09:25.902
Who doesn't have secrets? Hmm?

09:26.004 --> 09:29.005
We're good friends. I didn't have
a clue about your time in juvie.

09:29.107 --> 09:30.607
It was hard enough to do that time.

09:30.709 --> 09:32.805
I just never wanted to look back.

09:33.889 --> 09:37.280
So, you, uh... you find any
of Kate's secrets in this mess?

09:37.382 --> 09:38.982
Nope.

09:40.907 --> 09:44.053
She had a baby she never mentioned.

09:44.523 --> 09:45.542
What?

09:45.562 --> 09:48.992
And she took a bunch of cash
out of my savings.

09:49.094 --> 09:51.294
- Well, how much?
- Six figures.

09:51.396 --> 09:53.429
- Did you find the money?
- No.

09:53.531 --> 09:57.467
But maybe it's in the P.O. Box,
that I didn't know Kate had.

09:57.569 --> 09:59.602
Check that out tomorrow.

10:05.010 --> 10:06.409
Hi.

10:08.146 --> 10:11.011
- I wanted to know about...
- Mr. Warner.

10:11.901 --> 10:13.284
Thank you.

10:17.622 --> 10:19.555
A search warrant.

10:19.658 --> 10:21.391
As next of kin,
you're entitled to a copy

10:21.493 --> 10:22.859
and a receipt for the contents.

10:22.961 --> 10:25.328
I want to see what's inside
before you take it.

10:25.430 --> 10:28.398
- Do you have a key to the box?
- No.

10:30.168 --> 10:32.402
I didn't know Kate had
one until recently.

10:32.504 --> 10:36.653
Interesting. You didn't want
to report it to the police?

10:38.576 --> 10:42.345
Where were you two weeks
ago on Wednesday night?

10:42.890 --> 10:45.448
Why are you asking me
questions without my attorney?

10:45.550 --> 10:48.117
I can ask. You don't have to answer.

10:48.219 --> 10:51.087
But it makes me wonder
what else you're hiding.

10:51.189 --> 10:53.489
Where were you, Mr. Warner?

10:56.795 --> 11:00.363
Two weeks ago, I was watching my wife

11:00.465 --> 11:04.801
have dinner with her
ex-boyfriend, Shane Campbell.

11:05.650 --> 11:09.172
- Did you have an open marriage?
- Of course not.

11:09.274 --> 11:10.873
Shane has a high-tech security firm.

11:10.976 --> 11:13.009
Kate said he just needed legal advice.

11:13.111 --> 11:15.044
There are plenty of good
lawyers in this town.

11:15.146 --> 11:16.579
Nothing happened, Detective.

11:16.681 --> 11:19.882
- I trust my wife.
- And yet you followed her.

11:19.985 --> 11:22.085
I don't trust Shane Campbell.

11:22.187 --> 11:24.887
He and your wife met two
more times after that.

11:24.990 --> 11:29.025
Were you aware that Kate was
seeing her ex on a regular basis?

11:30.929 --> 11:33.529
No matter how much you dig,

11:33.631 --> 11:37.500
you'll never find anything
to prove I killed my wife.

11:58.367 --> 11:59.900
Good morning.

12:09.785 --> 12:11.344
Good morning.

12:11.670 --> 12:13.221
Hey, Sherry.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.286
Yes, of course.

12:19.355 --> 12:21.622
Sherwood equity group.
John Warner's office.

12:21.724 --> 12:23.223
Hold, please. Hold, please.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.891
- Can I have him call you back?
- Mm-hmm.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.627
- I will be sure to tell him.
- Mm-hmm.

12:26.729 --> 12:30.077
Well, the family's doing as well
as can be expected, Phil.

12:30.097 --> 12:32.924
Thank you for the flowers.
That was very kind.

12:32.944 --> 12:34.401
Well, I'm disappointed.

12:34.503 --> 12:37.400
You'll be missing future opportunities.

12:37.673 --> 12:39.220
Okay. Let me know.

12:39.722 --> 12:41.408
Looks like our investors
are jumping ship.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.831
Don't blame yourself, Eric.

12:43.851 --> 12:47.566
Doesn't require much for a good
reputation to take a hit, son.

12:47.586 --> 12:50.886
It's just rumors and gossip,
Eric. Problems we can fix.

12:57.458 --> 13:01.128
I want everyone in the
conference room in five minutes.

13:01.493 --> 13:04.563
S.E.G. is a business. No question.

13:05.384 --> 13:07.164
But my father wasn't wrong

13:07.184 --> 13:09.169
when he said we've evolved
into something more.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.469
We've become a family.

13:11.538 --> 13:13.605
Which is why I owe you an explanation.

13:13.707 --> 13:18.743
Some of you overheard
that I killed someone.

13:18.845 --> 13:20.378
And without knowing the facts,

13:20.480 --> 13:22.614
you naturally filled in all the blanks.

13:22.749 --> 13:26.184
I want you to hear from me
what really happened.

13:34.027 --> 13:36.844
What are you doing, numb nuts?

13:37.990 --> 13:40.932
What are you doing? Don't you walk
away from me when I'm talking to you.

13:41.034 --> 13:42.400
I was scared.

13:42.502 --> 13:43.702
I was pissed off.

13:43.804 --> 13:46.071
And I wanted the attacks to stop.

13:50.077 --> 13:51.676
You know your mother's a lush.

13:51.778 --> 13:54.112
Bet she sleeps in her own puke.

13:54.214 --> 13:55.947
Come on, man.

13:57.284 --> 14:00.185
- Ohh!
- Oh, man.

14:00.253 --> 14:03.622
I served six months
in juvenile detention.

14:03.724 --> 14:06.691
I paid with my freedom
for hitting Steven Porter.

14:06.793 --> 14:08.454
But no one...

14:09.496 --> 14:11.496
No one paid more than his family.

14:11.598 --> 14:14.032
What happened here? What happened?

14:16.536 --> 14:18.097
Steven!

14:18.555 --> 14:19.938
Dial 911!

14:20.040 --> 14:21.461
Now!

14:23.506 --> 14:27.145
If I could go back and...
And change the outcome...

14:31.351 --> 14:33.151
I can't.

14:34.085 --> 14:38.723
I am responsible for Steven's death.

14:39.406 --> 14:42.498
But my wife's a different story.

14:44.022 --> 14:46.865
Someone murdered her.

14:46.967 --> 14:51.169
I am a suspect, but so is
everyone who was there.

14:51.271 --> 14:54.739
You all know me, and you knew Kate.

14:56.408 --> 15:00.712
What you didn't know was that
whoever killed my wife also killed...

15:00.814 --> 15:03.515
Our unborn child.

15:06.753 --> 15:09.254
My world is gone.

15:10.924 --> 15:15.260
The easy thing would be
for me to go home,

15:15.362 --> 15:18.115
shut the door, and just give up.

15:19.032 --> 15:22.500
But I won't do that.
And I hope you won't do that.

15:22.602 --> 15:27.906
S.E.G. is successful because
of each and every one of you.

15:29.710 --> 15:34.012
And I can't do this alone.
I need you now more than ever.

15:34.832 --> 15:38.283
Now, if any of you feel like
I still had something

15:38.385 --> 15:41.119
to do with Kate's death,
you should leave.

15:41.221 --> 15:42.854
No hard feelings.

15:42.956 --> 15:45.457
Otherwise...

15:46.724 --> 15:48.442
Stay.

15:49.796 --> 15:51.963
Help us heal.

15:52.065 --> 15:54.265
And let's get back to work.

16:09.916 --> 16:12.092
That took guts.

16:12.112 --> 16:13.718
Drama queen.

16:27.033 --> 16:28.633
Uh...

16:28.735 --> 16:30.568
Well...

16:30.670 --> 16:33.271
It looks like a few people are missing.

16:34.206 --> 16:37.420
- Where are they?
- Two analysts quit.

16:38.318 --> 16:40.478
And Kate's assistant, Liam,
hasn't come back

16:40.498 --> 16:43.184
since your father
gave everyone time off.

16:43.204 --> 16:45.049
He and Kate were close.

16:45.069 --> 16:46.718
Maybe we should reach out
to him, give him a call,

16:46.820 --> 16:48.019
and make sure he's okay.

16:48.039 --> 16:51.089
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

16:51.191 --> 16:53.258
Hand over my father's call sheet.

16:53.278 --> 16:55.894
It's time the investors heard
it from the horse's mouth.

16:55.962 --> 16:57.562
Yeah.

17:03.069 --> 17:05.036
Okay, I'm, uh, ready for the next one.

17:05.137 --> 17:07.271
That's the end of the list, Eric.

17:10.065 --> 17:12.810
Thanks, May.

17:16.817 --> 17:18.616
How'd it go?

17:20.038 --> 17:22.020
You'll probably have
to follow up, but...

17:22.122 --> 17:24.355
Everyone heard me out.

17:24.848 --> 17:28.327
Well, if they don't like it, they
can take their money somewhere else.

17:28.347 --> 17:29.794
Screw them.

17:29.896 --> 17:31.529
You don't mean that, Dad.

17:31.631 --> 17:33.431
Business always came first.

17:37.255 --> 17:39.070
I did the best I could.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.975
I'm worried about you.

17:45.112 --> 17:48.081
So many people are worried about me.

17:49.683 --> 17:51.416
I'm fine.

17:51.518 --> 17:53.218
No, you're not fine.

17:53.238 --> 17:56.120
And you won't be fine tomorrow.
You won't be fine the next day.

17:56.223 --> 17:59.090
But eventually, you will.

17:59.192 --> 18:02.560
And when is that supposed to happen?

18:02.662 --> 18:04.643
I have no idea.

18:05.304 --> 18:07.480
I don't know your pain.

18:09.936 --> 18:11.769
I'm sorry, Dad.

18:11.789 --> 18:13.171
Don't be.

18:13.273 --> 18:15.106
I have my memories of your mother.

18:15.126 --> 18:16.941
And I have you kids.

18:23.281 --> 18:24.875
This is...

18:26.514 --> 18:29.131
Hard...

18:29.151 --> 18:31.890
But I have to give you this.

18:32.223 --> 18:34.392
A birth certificate.

18:34.494 --> 18:36.861
Kate was 16 years old.

18:36.881 --> 18:40.131
She had a baby boy at a
Boone County Hospital.

18:40.233 --> 18:42.333
Father is listed as "unknown."

18:42.435 --> 18:43.935
She gave her son up for adoption.

18:44.037 --> 18:45.370
Why do you have this?

18:45.472 --> 18:49.474
I had an investigator run it down
'cause I knew it was gonna eat at you.

18:54.014 --> 18:55.380
I should have known about this.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.881
What... what if he came looking for her?

18:56.901 --> 18:58.950
What was I supposed to say...
Just, "welcome to the family"?

18:58.970 --> 19:01.586
Eric, this is not necessarily about you.

19:01.655 --> 19:03.988
What were the circumstances
of her pregnancy?

19:04.008 --> 19:06.190
Was she forced to give up her baby?

19:08.561 --> 19:12.330
Don't judge when you
only have half the story.

19:43.059 --> 19:45.363
- No! No!
- Hey! Hey!

19:45.465 --> 19:47.899
- Hey!
- Stay out of it!

19:49.469 --> 19:51.936
You okay?

19:55.993 --> 19:57.462
- There he is.
- Mr. Warner.

19:57.482 --> 19:59.344
Why were you at the police
station yesterday, Eric?

19:59.412 --> 20:01.546
Where were you when
Kate went off the roof?

20:01.648 --> 20:03.481
Any idea who pushed Kate
off the building?

20:03.583 --> 20:04.731
How are you feeling at this time?

20:04.751 --> 20:05.899
They're saying your wife was pregnant.

20:05.919 --> 20:06.933
Could you please give us
a statement, sir?

20:06.953 --> 20:08.134
How does it feel to lose a child?

20:08.154 --> 20:09.636
Mr. Warner, did you know
your wife was pregnant?

20:09.656 --> 20:12.056
Any indication at all that...

20:15.059 --> 20:16.160
How bad is it?

20:16.262 --> 20:18.329
Ohh. I've been better.

20:18.431 --> 20:19.897
You know that guy?

20:19.999 --> 20:21.499
Never seen him before.

20:21.601 --> 20:24.435
You look fine, so I guess
you didn't catch him.

20:24.537 --> 20:26.237
God, what were you thinking?

20:26.339 --> 20:28.406
I don't know. Let's get
you to the hospital.

20:28.508 --> 20:29.941
Ohh, you go.

20:30.043 --> 20:32.410
I just need ibuprofen
and three fingers of scotch.

20:32.512 --> 20:34.879
- You need a doctor.
- He didn't hit me that hard.

20:34.981 --> 20:36.114
Ohh!

20:36.216 --> 20:37.548
Okay. I got you. Okay.

20:37.617 --> 20:39.584
- I got you. I got you.
- All right.

20:39.686 --> 20:41.552
You owe money?

20:41.654 --> 20:44.322
Only to those bloodsucking
ticks I was married to.

20:44.424 --> 20:45.590
What about other women, huh?

20:45.658 --> 20:48.092
Any crazy boyfriends or husbands
trying to run you off?

20:48.194 --> 20:50.728
The only women I see
are on pay-per-view.

20:52.355 --> 20:54.732
- Why?
- Oh, come on.

20:59.005 --> 21:00.861
Just what we need.

21:02.138 --> 21:04.569
Mr. Warner, Mr. Oliver.

21:05.027 --> 21:07.044
I understand there was some
trouble here this evening.

21:07.147 --> 21:08.546
What are you doing here, Detective?

21:08.648 --> 21:11.482
One of your neighbors heard
a fight and called the cops.

21:11.584 --> 21:13.311
I recognized the address.

21:13.331 --> 21:14.886
Do you sleep? Or have a life?

21:14.988 --> 21:16.454
I don't know. Anything else?

21:16.556 --> 21:17.989
Yes.

21:19.092 --> 21:21.459
I'm ready to take your statements.

21:21.561 --> 21:23.961
I'd prefer if we did this
some other time.

21:24.063 --> 21:26.197
Well, you can tell me
what happened here,

21:26.299 --> 21:28.886
or I can take Mr. Oliver off your hands.

21:29.035 --> 21:30.639
It's up to you.

21:41.247 --> 21:43.414
â™ª

21:44.536 --> 21:46.800
Interesting what you've
done with the place.

21:50.256 --> 21:52.456
So, Mr. Oliver, your attacker?

21:52.592 --> 21:54.859
He came out of nowhere and
just started pounding on me.

21:54.961 --> 21:56.260
Have you seen him before?

21:56.362 --> 21:58.763
Thanks. No.

21:58.865 --> 21:59.997
I see.

22:00.066 --> 22:02.200
So, he didn't ask you for your wallet

22:02.302 --> 22:04.435
or demand that you hand over

22:04.537 --> 22:06.571
that very expensive breitling watch?

22:06.673 --> 22:08.105
Of course he did.

22:08.208 --> 22:10.608
Eric showed up and stopped him.

22:12.242 --> 22:13.293
Then what happened?

22:13.313 --> 22:16.514
I chased him out of
the lobby, but he got away.

22:16.616 --> 22:18.508
Do you know what he looked like?

22:18.528 --> 22:21.536
He's white. 6 feet. Stocky.

22:22.391 --> 22:25.210
Was this the man that attacked you?

22:30.129 --> 22:32.296
That's him.

22:32.398 --> 22:33.864
Who is he?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.834
I believe Mr. Oliver is the
best person to explain that.

22:36.936 --> 22:39.722
I just told you... I don't know the guy.

22:40.004 --> 22:41.973
I don't think you're
telling me the truth.

22:42.075 --> 22:44.976
As usual, you're making
a big deal out of nothing.

22:45.078 --> 22:46.811
What's going on?

22:46.913 --> 22:48.479
Neil's expense report.

22:48.581 --> 22:51.282
You will reimburse the
company management $400.

22:51.384 --> 22:52.984
It's a legitimate expense.

22:53.086 --> 22:55.386
- I had lunch with an investor.
- Who?

22:55.488 --> 22:56.621
Marty Fields.

22:56.723 --> 22:58.422
Really? He says he hasn't
seen you in months.

22:58.524 --> 23:00.391
- Try again.
- You called him?

23:00.460 --> 23:01.759
Oh, see, that's dirty.

23:01.861 --> 23:04.362
The S.E.C. is cracking down
on inflated fund expenses,

23:04.464 --> 23:08.099
- so knock it off.
- It's a lousy 400 bucks.

23:08.201 --> 23:11.068
Next time you treat the interns,
tell them not to talk about it after.

23:11.170 --> 23:13.437
And who eats at a
buffet at a strip club?

23:13.539 --> 23:15.473
Men, Kate! Men!

23:15.575 --> 23:17.341
We get hungry.

23:20.089 --> 23:23.080
That's why you're paying for it.

23:27.687 --> 23:29.120
We had a blast.

23:29.222 --> 23:31.355
You should have come.

23:31.457 --> 23:33.758
Wings and ass don't go together, Neil.

23:33.826 --> 23:35.126
Sure, they do.

23:35.228 --> 23:36.327
Why didn't you call me?

23:36.429 --> 23:39.664
Because you're married
now and legally dead.

23:42.030 --> 23:44.201
Let's go over your movements
the night Kate died.

23:44.221 --> 23:47.004
At any point, did you leave
the party and return?

23:47.106 --> 23:49.359
I already gave you my statement.

23:49.940 --> 23:53.711
A lot of witnesses forget details

23:53.813 --> 23:56.113
or leave things out.

23:56.215 --> 23:58.783
I'm giving you a chance to remember.

23:59.952 --> 24:02.219
I, uh...

24:02.322 --> 24:04.975
I went outside for about a half an hour.

24:05.187 --> 24:08.190
- Not up to the roof?
- Where'd you go?

24:08.314 --> 24:09.794
I went downstairs to smoke.

24:09.896 --> 24:12.897
You don't smoke, not even cigars.

24:12.999 --> 24:14.498
Weed.

24:14.600 --> 24:17.601
I-I got bored, so I took a joint
off one of the assistants.

24:17.704 --> 24:19.870
- Satisfied?
- The assistant's name?

24:19.972 --> 24:21.824
Liam Connors.

24:22.124 --> 24:23.595
Mm.

24:25.785 --> 24:29.547
What's the name of this woman
standing with you and Liam?

24:32.590 --> 24:34.167
I don't know her.

24:34.264 --> 24:35.920
- She wasn't your date?
- No.

24:35.988 --> 24:38.673
I tried getting her number,
and she shot me down.

24:38.693 --> 24:40.061
Mm.

24:40.405 --> 24:41.926
Thank you so much for your time.

24:42.028 --> 24:45.833
I'll be sure to be in touch
if I locate your attacker.

24:56.642 --> 24:59.343
You do know why that guy was after you.

24:59.445 --> 25:02.012
No. No, but, you know,
the last few days,

25:02.115 --> 25:03.447
I thought someone was following me.

25:03.549 --> 25:06.217
- I just saw...
- What the hell is wrong with you?

25:06.285 --> 25:08.586
You came here to hide out,
and you bring trouble with you?

25:08.688 --> 25:10.955
You know what? I see it's time
for me to give you some space.

25:11.057 --> 25:12.390
You're lying to that cop.

25:12.492 --> 25:13.457
Now you're lying to me.

25:13.559 --> 25:14.992
- You need to cool down.
- It's too late.

25:15.094 --> 25:16.460
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

25:16.562 --> 25:18.629
That guy kicked your ass. He'll be back.

25:18.731 --> 25:21.212
Next time, I won't be there.

25:22.649 --> 25:24.902
- You've got this all wrong.
- Kate's dead!

25:25.004 --> 25:27.972
The guy who hit me doesn't have
anything to do with Kate's murder.

25:28.074 --> 25:31.218
Then why does Cornell
already have a sketch of him?

25:33.980 --> 25:35.413
Get the hell out.

25:36.315 --> 25:37.703
Get out!

25:54.160 --> 25:55.667
Were you able to contact Liam?

25:55.687 --> 25:57.391
No. I've left three voicemail messages.

25:57.411 --> 26:00.412
- He hasn't called back.
- Okay, text me his number, please.

26:07.354 --> 26:09.688
Dad wants me to go to meetings.

26:09.708 --> 26:11.623
Probably not a bad idea.

26:11.692 --> 26:13.992
Maybe give the bottle a rest.

26:14.655 --> 26:16.661
Business meetings, dumb-ass.

26:16.763 --> 26:17.796
Not A.A.

26:20.400 --> 26:22.167
Makes sense.

26:22.269 --> 26:24.669
Owes it to the firm to make
sure things are running smoothly

26:24.771 --> 26:28.006
- in case I have to bail.
- Oh, how did this get to be about you?

26:28.108 --> 26:30.275
Me going to lunch
with Dad's farting cronies

26:30.295 --> 26:32.110
is a trick to get me
to be more responsible.

26:32.212 --> 26:34.279
You should want that for yourself.

26:34.381 --> 26:37.315
I am very happy the way
that I am, thank you.

26:37.417 --> 26:39.084
And besides, Dad is
not worried about you.

26:39.186 --> 26:41.686
This isn't the first time he's tried
to get me to be more like you.

26:41.788 --> 26:43.955
The old man is always playing the odds.

26:44.057 --> 26:45.845
- If something happens...
- Let me rephrase this.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.765
Dad is not worried
about you getting pinched.

26:47.867 --> 26:49.100
I went away once.

26:49.202 --> 26:51.069
That's not happening again.

26:51.171 --> 26:54.668
The only place that you're
going is to lunch with me.

26:54.688 --> 26:56.240
I'm working, Patrick.

26:56.343 --> 26:59.098
You're not sleeping. You're not eating.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.578
Come on. Let's roll.

27:01.364 --> 27:02.747
Look, you should probably drive, though.

27:02.849 --> 27:04.482
I'm not... I'm not saying
that I've had a few.

27:04.502 --> 27:06.751
- Okay.
- But I'm not denying it either, so...

27:06.853 --> 27:08.686
Okay, you got to stop.

27:08.755 --> 27:10.588
Look, Melanie's already
at the restaurant waiting,

27:10.690 --> 27:13.491
and she does not like to wait.

27:13.593 --> 27:15.259
Or cook.

27:15.362 --> 27:17.996
Or clean or service me in any way.

27:18.098 --> 27:20.898
- All right, all right.
- Come on.

27:21.001 --> 27:22.467
â™ª

27:22.569 --> 27:24.936
I lost my father when I was 18.

27:25.038 --> 27:27.605
It gets bearable,
but it never goes away.

27:29.122 --> 27:31.864
I read that on a sympathy
card once. It's so true.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.083
Um...

27:33.242 --> 27:35.346
Mel is not a shrink,

27:35.448 --> 27:37.448
even though she plays
one in her own mind.

27:38.852 --> 27:40.685
I think Melanie likes to mislead people

27:40.787 --> 27:42.320
as to how smart she really is.

27:42.389 --> 27:44.622
So, Kate was a teen mom.

27:44.724 --> 27:46.891
I mean, did anyone think
she was that interesting?

27:46.993 --> 27:48.926
This is like reality TV, but better.

27:49.029 --> 27:51.845
- It's pillow talk.
- Oh, come on.

27:51.865 --> 27:53.164
This family never talks
about anything...

27:53.266 --> 27:54.547
Anything important at all.

27:54.567 --> 27:57.191
You guys just brush
everything under the rug.

28:00.006 --> 28:04.009
Ever cross your mind it might be too
soon for me to talk about my wife?

28:04.029 --> 28:05.276
Why, Eric?

28:05.378 --> 28:07.145
Kate was young when she
had the baby, right?

28:07.247 --> 28:08.513
It was a long time ago.

28:08.615 --> 28:09.681
Long before she married you.

28:09.783 --> 28:12.341
How much of her life
were you entitled to?

28:15.121 --> 28:17.388
Have you ever kept
something from Patrick?

28:19.959 --> 28:22.293
She only tells me what I need to know.

30:12.803 --> 30:14.371
When did the cops search your place?

30:14.391 --> 30:16.841
Don't get excited. They didn't. I did.

30:16.910 --> 30:18.548
Why?

30:19.270 --> 30:21.412
Because my wife was a liar.

30:22.159 --> 30:24.132
Okay, you know that's not true.

30:24.388 --> 30:27.018
I just found out
about a baby, a P.O. Box,

30:27.120 --> 30:28.286
and a lot of missing money.

30:28.388 --> 30:30.254
It sure sounds true to me.

30:30.356 --> 30:31.556
All right.

30:31.624 --> 30:33.491
You are in a place right now,

30:33.593 --> 30:36.794
and I don't know what to
say to pull you out of it.

30:36.896 --> 30:38.996
Well, then leave me alone.

30:39.098 --> 30:41.566
Please.

30:41.668 --> 30:44.702
So you can keep doing things like this?

30:45.311 --> 30:48.121
What exactly were you expecting to find?

30:48.588 --> 30:51.442
Answers. Insight.

30:52.127 --> 30:54.074
Who the hell was my wife?

30:54.629 --> 30:56.735
I know she loved you.

30:57.035 --> 30:58.488
Just stop.

30:58.918 --> 31:00.233
You didn't know Kate either.

31:00.253 --> 31:03.154
I tore this whole place apart,
and I didn't find anything.

31:03.256 --> 31:05.022
Maybe I never will.

31:05.124 --> 31:06.457
Did you check the bathroom?

31:07.203 --> 31:09.760
Why... why would I look in there?

31:09.863 --> 31:13.759
Women will hide things in the
one place a man will never look.

31:24.577 --> 31:26.744
What is it?

31:35.221 --> 31:37.721
It's an extortion letter.

31:38.091 --> 31:40.170
You were being blackmailed.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.676
Did you know about this?

31:47.693 --> 31:50.902
Who the hell was
blackmailing you, and why?

31:56.433 --> 31:59.867
Blackmail is a felony. Did you pay it?

32:00.146 --> 32:02.853
I absolutely refused.

32:04.719 --> 32:07.051
This came in the mail?

32:07.153 --> 32:09.523
There's no stamp, no return address,

32:09.543 --> 32:11.176
so someone must have slipped
this in the mailbox.

32:11.196 --> 32:13.712
I have no idea who sent this.

32:14.509 --> 32:16.015
Pay it.

32:16.117 --> 32:17.449
Hell, no.

32:17.551 --> 32:19.652
If my time in juvie
comes out, I'll resign.

32:19.687 --> 32:22.388
I'm not gonna pay someone
50 grand to cover up my past.

32:22.408 --> 32:24.490
One day soon, your father
will hand you the firm.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.558
You don't need this
hanging over your head.

32:26.661 --> 32:27.826
I won't lie, Kate.

32:27.928 --> 32:29.110
I'm not asking you to.

32:29.130 --> 32:31.263
We... we pay the blackmail.
We track the money.

32:31.332 --> 32:32.765
We hand the bastard over to the police.

32:32.867 --> 32:33.932
We don't even know who this is.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.367
They could be desperate
or even dangerous.

32:35.469 --> 32:37.870
We don't have to get close.
There's tracking software.

32:37.972 --> 32:41.140
Eric, we need to control
this information.

32:45.146 --> 32:46.512
It's my past.

32:46.614 --> 32:49.181
It's my decision.

32:58.004 --> 33:01.193
So Kate must have
intercepted a second demand.

33:01.295 --> 33:03.595
They wanted 50 grand the first time.

33:03.664 --> 33:04.797
This time, $100,000.

33:04.899 --> 33:07.032
They must have doubled
the price when I didn't pay it.

33:07.134 --> 33:09.601
That is why Kate took the cash
out of your savings...

33:09.670 --> 33:11.394
To protect you.

33:12.195 --> 33:14.073
What's in the second envelope?

33:16.777 --> 33:18.944
It's a DNA report.

33:19.046 --> 33:21.780
Kate sent the envelope to a private lab.

33:21.849 --> 33:26.018
She wanted to identify whoever
was trying to shake me down.

33:27.688 --> 33:30.022
You should have brought
this to me, Eric.

33:30.124 --> 33:32.658
I know how to handle scumbags like this.

33:32.760 --> 33:35.171
You work in the Public
Defenders' Office.

33:35.191 --> 33:38.030
Like you said, it's a felony. Wouldn't
you have to report it to the cops?

33:38.050 --> 33:39.198
Yes, and if I had,

33:39.218 --> 33:41.800
the bastard would probably
already be in cuffs.

33:41.902 --> 33:44.670
Maybe Kate would still be alive.

33:46.374 --> 33:48.941
Can we use the DNA report to find him?

33:48.961 --> 33:51.243
There are 350 million
people in this country.

33:51.345 --> 33:53.928
Less than 4% are in the database.

33:53.948 --> 33:55.730
A long shot's better
than nothing, right?

33:55.750 --> 33:58.517
Following a paper trail in
the digital age is not so easy.

33:58.619 --> 34:00.519
If your blackmailer's not in the system,

34:00.539 --> 34:02.488
his DNA won't matter until he's caught.

34:02.590 --> 34:04.123
That's Cornell's problem.

34:04.225 --> 34:06.597
We cannot give this to Cornell yet.

34:10.541 --> 34:12.464
Eric.

34:12.565 --> 34:13.866
How do you think a Homicide Detective

34:13.886 --> 34:16.335
will receive your new evidence?

34:16.437 --> 34:19.181
Cornell will have to investigate it.

34:19.428 --> 34:24.643
"Interesting you're only bringing this
to my attention now, Mr. Warner."

34:29.083 --> 34:30.181
Seriously, Eric,

34:30.284 --> 34:32.551
Cornell will accuse you
of trying to distract her

34:32.620 --> 34:34.853
from finding a killer
who she thinks is you.

34:34.922 --> 34:37.989
If I give her this DNA report,
she'll know it's not me.

34:38.092 --> 34:40.359
A.D.As, P.Ds, and cops all think alike.

34:40.428 --> 34:42.360
We are used to people lying to us.

34:42.463 --> 34:44.226
We even expect it.

34:44.455 --> 34:46.364
Kate asked you to pay the blackmail.

34:46.467 --> 34:49.868
You refused. Now I am asking you
to wait before you hand it over.

34:49.888 --> 34:50.896
Until when?

34:50.916 --> 34:54.072
Until Cornell stops thinking
you killed your wife.

34:54.909 --> 34:56.842
Can't do it, Mandy.

34:57.878 --> 35:00.786
This guy could have killed Kate
if she found out who he was.

35:00.806 --> 35:03.449
If I don't turn this in,
his trail goes cold.

35:03.551 --> 35:08.086
Gatling juvenile was like
Summer Camp compared to prison.

35:08.189 --> 35:11.423
Ben Crawford, the innocent
man Cornell put away,

35:11.492 --> 35:13.392
was killed there.

35:18.276 --> 35:20.332
I appreciate what you're trying to do,

35:20.434 --> 35:23.208
but I really need
your support right now.

35:23.228 --> 35:25.070
I want my little sister, not a lawyer.

35:25.139 --> 35:26.872
Well, you know what?

35:26.974 --> 35:28.707
I can't be both.

35:30.444 --> 35:31.877
- What's this?
- It's a list...

35:31.979 --> 35:35.005
Of the best defense attorneys I know.

35:35.128 --> 35:37.736
Do not talk to Cornell without one.

35:55.581 --> 35:56.962
Hey.

35:58.337 --> 36:00.453
- Amanda called you.
- I'm glad she did. Look.

36:00.555 --> 36:01.955
I know you're upset.

36:02.057 --> 36:03.623
The hits just keep coming,

36:03.725 --> 36:05.692
and this feels like the right next step.

36:05.794 --> 36:06.793
I have thought this through.

36:06.895 --> 36:08.595
If you had, you would not be here now.

36:08.697 --> 36:10.360
This isn't a business deal gone wrong.

36:10.380 --> 36:11.864
You don't have any
experience in this world.

36:11.967 --> 36:12.981
That's not true, Eric.

36:13.001 --> 36:16.441
I learned a lot about this world
the last time you were in trouble.

36:17.739 --> 36:19.505
This is different.

36:19.608 --> 36:22.241
I have friends in the know who advise me

36:22.344 --> 36:25.111
that you are squarely
in that woman's cross hairs.

36:25.131 --> 36:27.395
And I need you and your
friends to back off, please.

36:29.884 --> 36:31.451
You can go with the officer.

36:31.586 --> 36:33.186
Ma'am.

36:35.926 --> 36:37.926
- Thank you.
- Come with me.

36:41.354 --> 36:45.248
Is there something I can
help you with, Mr. Warner?

36:46.339 --> 36:50.953
I just want to know when I can see
the mail from Kate's P.O. Box.

36:51.050 --> 36:55.308
The contents will be returned to you
if they're not logged as evidence.

36:55.925 --> 36:57.781
And when will that be?

36:57.801 --> 37:00.094
When I've made my arrest.

37:00.693 --> 37:02.715
Mr. Warner.

37:03.197 --> 37:06.899
I'd like to thank you for your
donation to the fraternal order.

37:06.919 --> 37:10.056
We so appreciate your generosity.

37:15.664 --> 37:18.064
Who was that woman
who was with the detective?

37:18.971 --> 37:20.466
Her name is Tina Sawyer.

37:20.568 --> 37:23.236
We, uh... We dated briefly.

37:23.338 --> 37:25.675
And why does Cornell
want to talk to her?

37:25.895 --> 37:30.142
Because she's gonna tell her
exactly what she wants to hear.

37:33.815 --> 37:35.415
Hey, what's going on?

37:35.517 --> 37:37.650
I'll tender my resignation
first thing in the morning.

37:37.752 --> 37:39.252
Wait. What are you talking about?

37:39.320 --> 37:41.387
What can that woman say
that could be so damaging?

37:41.489 --> 37:43.690
If any more of my past gets
leaked, the firm goes down.

37:43.792 --> 37:45.792
If... if I get arrested,
the firm goes down.

37:45.894 --> 37:47.794
Just let me put some distance between us

37:47.862 --> 37:49.829
so that you and the
company are protected.

37:49.931 --> 37:52.865
I am your father. I protect you.

37:52.967 --> 37:54.167
Not this time.

37:54.269 --> 37:56.769
Please don't do anything rash.

37:56.871 --> 37:59.205
How can I help you if you
won't tell me what's going on?

37:59.307 --> 38:01.474
There's nothing you can do about it.

38:17.575 --> 38:19.346
Is everything all right?

38:20.228 --> 38:21.803
It's fine.

38:22.864 --> 38:25.432
I didn't think you were coming in today.

38:25.969 --> 38:29.906
Uh... I have some paperwork
I got to take care of.

38:29.926 --> 38:31.706
Want me to stay?

38:33.398 --> 38:35.408
No. No.

38:36.711 --> 38:38.211
Were you able to reach Liam?

38:38.313 --> 38:39.579
I sent you the number.

38:39.681 --> 38:41.848
Uh, slipped my mind. I'll try him now.

38:41.950 --> 38:43.182
Uh...

38:48.056 --> 38:49.555
You've reached Liam. Leave me a message.

38:49.657 --> 38:51.747
It went straight to voicemail.

38:51.767 --> 38:52.992
You know what? Just give me his address.

38:53.094 --> 38:56.129
And I'll, uh... I'll check on him later.

38:56.231 --> 38:58.981
Anything else I can do?

39:00.136 --> 39:01.400
Um, no.

39:01.503 --> 39:02.902
Go home.

39:03.004 --> 39:05.158
- Good night.
- Good night.

39:15.388 --> 39:17.564
It's been a rough few days.

39:19.821 --> 39:22.789
You're upset. But you know me.

39:22.857 --> 39:26.157
I would never do anything
to jeopardize our friendship.

39:28.723 --> 39:31.831
I know you like to cover your own ass

39:31.933 --> 39:34.534
and pretend you're doing
everyone else a favor.

39:34.636 --> 39:36.969
That's... fair.

39:38.540 --> 39:42.330
I have my faults, but I didn't
think I was alone in that.

39:43.423 --> 39:44.937
You're not.

39:46.417 --> 39:48.183
So we're good?

39:48.703 --> 39:51.217
As soon as you come clean...

39:51.926 --> 39:53.519
We'll be great.
