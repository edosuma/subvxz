00:51.685 --> 00:57.692
Sometimes, God taketh away
what God hath giventh.

00:57.858 --> 01:01.203
A mother who bears us
with her loins...

01:01.929 --> 01:03.840
bears us always...

01:04.598 --> 01:08.045
and lives forever in our hearts.

01:12.005 --> 01:13.575
Let's go talk to her now.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.913
Just sit next to her.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.578
Doris.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.691
Hey, sis. How you holding up?

01:20.847 --> 01:21.951
I'm holding up.

01:22.115 --> 01:24.220
Supposed to hold up,
so I'm holding up.

01:24.384 --> 01:27.058
Hey, you know,
we're all pretty devastated, so...

01:27.220 --> 01:30.565
Anyway, Cynthia and I were thinking,
now that Ma's gone...

01:30.724 --> 01:34.194
maybe you could get
your own place in the city...

01:34.361 --> 01:37.808
- close to your job and everything.
- You wouldn't have to ride the ferry.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.376
You've really earned this.

01:39.533 --> 01:42.742
You've been living in Mom's house,
taking care of her all these years.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.940
Which was so noble of you.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.382
- I don't know how you did it. Really.
- So noble.

01:48.542 --> 01:52.581
And I was thinking that, you know,
once we cleaned out Mama's junk...

01:53.313 --> 01:57.318
that we should think about
maybe selling the house too.

01:58.118 --> 02:03.090
- Todd, all my stuff is there.
- Yeah.

02:03.256 --> 02:05.429
All right. Um...

02:05.626 --> 02:07.333
Look, I just...

02:07.494 --> 02:08.973
We, uh...

02:09.128 --> 02:10.130
Here.

02:10.797 --> 02:13.505
Her name is Sylvia Edwards
and she could really help.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.511
- Help with what?
- The hoarding, Doris.

02:16.670 --> 02:19.583
You and Mom,
you held on to a lot of stuff.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.186
Please, sis, just meet with her.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.632
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry. Could someone hit eight, please?

04:23.797 --> 04:25.299
Thanks.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.609
It's tight quarters.

04:38.411 --> 04:41.255
- It's pretty awkward, huh?
- Yeah.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.826
Here. These are a little...

04:48.121 --> 04:50.158
Sorry, they were on your ear.
Is that better?

04:50.323 --> 04:52.564
- Boy, yeah.
- Yeah.

04:56.830 --> 04:57.900
I like your glasses.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.112
They're cat eyeglasses?

05:02.269 --> 05:03.646
Yeah.

05:04.971 --> 05:05.972
They're cool.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.848
Okay. Thanks.

05:48.615 --> 05:49.685
Hey, Doris?

05:50.650 --> 05:51.651
Doris?

05:53.386 --> 05:56.026
Anne's replacing all our chairs
with these posture balls.

05:57.858 --> 06:01.806
She's got a whole truckload.
So I'm gonna need your chair, Doris.

06:01.962 --> 06:04.465
I like my chair. It has a back.

06:04.631 --> 06:07.976
You know I don't make the rules, right?
I'm just the muscle.

06:08.134 --> 06:12.048
Can I have everyone
gather around please? Over here.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.479
Over here.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.044
Over here.

06:16.977 --> 06:21.084
I would like to introduce everyone
to John Fremont.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.159
John is the new art director.

06:23.316 --> 06:27.321
He joins us after a successful stint
in the L.A. office.

06:27.487 --> 06:28.989
We're very happy to have him.

06:29.155 --> 06:31.431
So let's give him
a big New York welcome.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.196
- Speech.
- Speech.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.740
Speech.

06:39.266 --> 06:42.839
Okay, uh, I'll give it a shot.

06:43.536 --> 06:47.416
So I know it's a far cry
from the sandy beaches of Malibu...

06:48.842 --> 06:52.915
But, um, it's really great to be here
in the city that never sleeps.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.181
So that's it.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.456
That's all, folks.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.891
You're so funny, John.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.037
Okay, everyone back to work.

07:06.192 --> 07:07.728
Okay.

07:07.894 --> 07:09.134
Actually, wait.

07:09.729 --> 07:11.868
There's one last thing
that I need to say.

07:12.399 --> 07:15.243
I met a woman in the elevator
this morning.

07:15.402 --> 07:18.281
And we hardly exchanged
more than a few words...

07:18.438 --> 07:20.782
but she made a big
impression on me.

07:21.374 --> 07:23.217
She's standing right there.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.820
Look, lady, I don't even
know your name...

07:28.114 --> 07:31.618
but you set off a fire inside of me
I have not been able to put out...

07:31.785 --> 07:33.822
since the moment
I laid eyes on you.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.795
Can we explore this?

07:38.124 --> 07:39.501
Doris?

07:43.229 --> 07:44.936
Doris?

07:45.565 --> 07:46.839
Doris?

07:47.000 --> 07:50.277
Hey, sorry to interrupt
whatever that was.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.307
Just me and the cats now.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.614
I hope I don't end up like one of those
weird old New Yorkers...

07:57.777 --> 08:00.758
that chokes on a peanut and dies
and no one even misses me...

08:00.914 --> 08:04.020
until the smell of my decomposing
body seeps through the walls.

08:04.184 --> 08:08.155
- Oh, honey, I would miss you. I would...
- Get in the slow lane, ladies.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.494
You go eat some kale.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.534
- Fascist.
- She gave us the finger, Roz.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.103
- Give her the finger.
- Fascist!

08:14.260 --> 08:16.171
- Roz, no, no, no.
- Hey, hey, hey.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.603
Yeah, you'd better run.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.141
Run away.

08:19.299 --> 08:22.678
Run away, girl. Uh-huh.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.544
Will you get your friend?

08:26.706 --> 08:29.778
Oh, Roz. For goodness sakes,
just give her the finger next time.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.063
Look, see, she ran away.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.452
Of course. You scared
the heck out of her.

08:33.613 --> 08:38.357
And then after that,
John says, "Th-Th-That's all, folks."

08:38.518 --> 08:39.895
You know, like Bugs Bunny.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.895
And Anne goes, "ooh," you know.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.898
I don't even think
she got the reference.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.367
- That one is such a phony baloney.
- Yeah. I know.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.132
Come on because I don't wanna
be late for this lecture.

08:49.295 --> 08:51.639
So who is this guy again?

08:51.798 --> 08:53.471
One of those motivational speakers.

08:53.633 --> 08:55.977
Val says he's like that doctor on TV.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.740
- I don't know.
- Only better looking.

08:57.904 --> 08:59.645
Come on.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.244
- I'm coming.
- It'll do you good to be around people.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.392
- They do a snack table here.
- How many things do you get?

09:11.551 --> 09:15.089
- You remember that guy that did the...
- Looks like four bites of cheese.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.235
I'm sorry, ma'am.

09:17.390 --> 09:21.770
We are not allowed to serve the cheese
and crackers until after the lecture.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.035
- Bureaucrat.
- Roz.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.767
- Doris. Hurry up.
- There's Val.

09:25.932 --> 09:28.503
I've got primo seats for us. Hurry up.

09:29.669 --> 09:32.115
There's always one in every crowd.

09:32.705 --> 09:34.013
- Doris.
- Yes.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.552
- I'm so sorry about your mother.
- Yes.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.347
Did you get the Edible Arrangement?

09:38.511 --> 09:40.787
Yes, I did, thank you.
Thank you so much.

09:40.947 --> 09:43.188
Willy Williams.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.525
Hey.

09:45.785 --> 09:46.786
Hey.

09:46.953 --> 09:48.125
Hey, hey.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.063
Hey, hey.

09:50.223 --> 09:52.225
Have you lost your way?

09:52.792 --> 09:54.738
Is there something missing?

09:54.928 --> 09:55.963
Mm-hm.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.539
An emptiness.

09:58.064 --> 10:01.204
But, folks, don't look back at your life
and ask, "Why me?"

10:01.367 --> 10:04.439
Look ahead and ask,
"Why not me?"

10:04.604 --> 10:06.606
Ask yourself, "Why not me?"
Right now.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.083
Why not me?

10:09.242 --> 10:12.382
We've all got fears.
I'm afraid of a lot of things.

10:12.545 --> 10:15.651
Am I safe?
Am I providing for my family?

10:15.815 --> 10:20.093
Am I doing everything I can
to make this world a better place?

10:20.787 --> 10:23.734
But when it comes to our goals
and our dreams...

10:23.890 --> 10:27.235
fear is just another four letter word
that begins with F.

10:27.393 --> 10:31.637
And folks, don't let your fear of what
could happen make nothing happen.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.277
Don't make that mistake.

10:33.433 --> 10:37.904
Life is short, folks. Let me tell you,
it is over in the blink of an eye.

10:38.771 --> 10:40.273
And that's why I always say:

10:40.440 --> 10:42.977
There are seven days in the week...

10:43.143 --> 10:47.523
and "someday" isn't one of them.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.250
Hey, hey.

10:49.415 --> 10:50.917
Hey, hey.

10:51.684 --> 10:52.958
This is very good cheese.

10:53.119 --> 10:56.589
I think it's some kind of a Spanish
Manchego. It has a certain olé to it.

10:56.756 --> 10:59.202
Did you see that really cute guy
in the third row?

10:59.359 --> 11:00.770
- Okay.
- Hubba, hubba.

11:00.927 --> 11:03.007
- He's coming this way. Coming.
- Hello, ladies.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.700
Thanks so much for coming to my talk.
You got my DVD.

11:05.865 --> 11:06.866
Yes.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.513
There's actually some great advice
in there, Doris.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.444
- Yes, yes.
- Great name.

11:11.604 --> 11:15.347
- My mother named me after Doris Day.
- Doris Day is my all-time favorite.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.853
You know what her real last name was?
Von Kappelhoff.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.959
- It's funny, huh?
- Very, very funny.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.721
- Excuse me, I just... I have to...
- Certainly.

11:24.884 --> 11:27.728
Mr. Williams, may I ask a question?

11:27.887 --> 11:29.628
Ask me anything.

11:29.789 --> 11:34.033
Mr. Williams,
there's something I want.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.641
Is this something a someone?

11:37.797 --> 11:39.242
Yes.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.003
And he...

11:41.167 --> 11:44.341
He's very different than me.
It just seems impossible.

11:44.504 --> 11:47.576
- Impossible, a confounding word.
- And yet I use it all the time.

11:47.740 --> 11:50.016
- There's no such thing as impossible.
- No?

11:50.176 --> 11:51.849
- Think about the word itself.
- Okay.

11:52.345 --> 11:56.054
I'm possible.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.423
- I'm possible.
- I'm possible.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.565
We're just looking at things
the wrong way.

12:00.720 --> 12:05.191
Like this glass of water,
is it half full or is it half empty?

12:05.358 --> 12:09.932
- I don't know.
- It's all about the way we look at things.

12:10.096 --> 12:13.236
- Do you see?
- I see.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.743
- Yes, you do see.
- Yes, I do see.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.348
Well, I'm glad lo see you, Doris.

12:18.504 --> 12:21.508
You are perfect inside and out.

12:21.674 --> 12:24.678
You're a green ball of glowing light.

12:24.844 --> 12:28.519
And don't let anyone
tell you otherwise.

12:30.516 --> 12:32.689
Oh, I recognize you.

12:33.119 --> 12:38.899
I'm possible.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.762
I'm possible.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.903
I'm possible.

12:48.768 --> 12:52.272
I guess what I'm thinking is that
whether it's digital or analogue...

12:52.438 --> 12:54.611
- the brand has to be unified.
- I agree. Yeah.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.050
Change up the typeface...

13:07.253 --> 13:08.161
What is this one?

13:08.186 --> 13:10.747
See, I like this one a lot too.
This is...

13:10.890 --> 13:12.335
John?

13:12.492 --> 13:14.403
John, over here, John.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.971
Hello.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.469
Heh, this is...

13:18.631 --> 13:21.578
John, I...

13:21.734 --> 13:24.146
- Just... Hello.
- I'm gonna... Just hold on. Real quick.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.687
Hi, is everything okay?

13:32.845 --> 13:36.088
So I'm... John, this is the situation.

13:36.249 --> 13:39.526
It seems that I have a defective ball.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.697
Yes, I'm...

13:43.122 --> 13:45.625
practically empty here.

13:45.958 --> 13:49.997
- Oh, look at that.
- And the other day I saw you...

13:50.163 --> 13:54.873
so I put it together in my head
because you came in with a bike pump...

13:55.034 --> 13:57.207
and so I thought,
"There you go."

13:57.370 --> 14:00.544
- Let me grab my pump. Be right back.
- Okay. Okay.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.386
BRB.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.287
Lucky bike pump.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.125
- Okay. Let me take a look.
- Okay.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.459
Okay.

14:16.322 --> 14:18.359
- If I could just... Sorry.
- Yeah.

14:18.958 --> 14:21.234
Do you wanna get off the ball
while I do this?

14:21.861 --> 14:24.705
- Do I have to? I have bad knees.
- Oh.

14:25.164 --> 14:27.337
- Uh, oh, okay.
- Okay.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.002
All right.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.313
There we go.

14:37.143 --> 14:40.056
Um... Um...

14:40.747 --> 14:42.590
How are you liking the new job?

14:42.749 --> 14:46.094
- The new j... Pretty good so far, I guess.
- Is it? Is it?

14:46.252 --> 14:47.993
- Feel like I'm managing okay.
- Yeah.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.000
Okay.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.703
- All right.
- Okay.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.566
Sorry.

14:54.927 --> 14:56.497
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:56.662 --> 14:58.198
- How's that?
- Oh, good.

14:58.364 --> 14:59.672
Yeah? It's not too hard?

14:59.832 --> 15:01.243
- No, oh, no.
- Okay.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.711
- I'm gonna pull it out, okay?
- Okay, okay, okay.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.579
- Let me get that back in. All right.
- Ooh.

15:10.676 --> 15:13.282
- Yeah, there you go.
- All right.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.891
Good.

15:15.181 --> 15:17.422
- Well, all right.
- All right.

15:17.583 --> 15:22.089
- I'm really glad I could help.
- I'm glad you're glad you could help.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.236
- That was great pumping. Okay.
- Okay. Yeah.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.268
- Bye.
- Bye.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.081
Oh, hey.

15:53.419 --> 15:56.093
Hey, you guys order the chicken
or the chicken?

15:56.956 --> 15:58.162
I'm possible.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.099
I'm possible.

16:00.259 --> 16:02.051
What's going
on with that guy?

16:02.076 --> 16:04.254
It's okay, but we met
at a Panera Bread...

16:04.397 --> 16:07.571
- because it has clean bathrooms.
- Yeah, that feels like a problem.

16:07.733 --> 16:11.010
- Catch you later. I'll get coffee, okay?
- See you soon.

16:18.010 --> 16:19.512
Oh, hey, Doris.

16:20.112 --> 16:21.113
Is everything okay?

16:21.280 --> 16:25.854
I just wanted to ask
if I could get another cup of coffee.

16:26.786 --> 16:29.528
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course.
Um, let me just get out of your way.

16:29.755 --> 16:32.531
- Om.
- Ow! Ow! Okay.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.330
Damn it. Okay. All right.

16:34.494 --> 16:38.601
- Oh, no. Oh, no, I'm so sorry. So sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

16:38.764 --> 16:41.040
Let me help. I'm so, so sorry.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.146
I'm so sorry.

16:43.302 --> 16:44.940
No, please.

16:45.104 --> 16:47.880
- Doris, stop it.
- God.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.979
Stop.

16:50.643 --> 16:51.883
Okay.

16:52.044 --> 16:54.217
- You did that on purpose, didn't you?
- No.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.189
- Yeah, you did.
- No, no, I didn't.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.623
- You're a liar.
- I'm not.

16:57.783 --> 16:59.660
- And that's okay.
- Oh...!

17:00.186 --> 17:02.029
I...

17:06.025 --> 17:07.299
Oh, my God, you're sexy.

17:07.460 --> 17:10.805
I am?

17:18.037 --> 17:21.040
Doris? Doris?

17:22.474 --> 17:25.080
- Doris, are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

17:26.311 --> 17:29.486
Oh, yeah. I forgot something.

17:49.435 --> 17:50.436
So...

17:51.437 --> 17:55.112
Todd says you and your mother
liked collecting things, is that true?

17:56.876 --> 17:59.186
- Sometimes.
- What kinds of things?

17:59.679 --> 18:04.560
Do you like to buy things new
or do you find things on the street?

18:05.685 --> 18:07.858
Sometimes people throw away
really nice things.

18:08.020 --> 18:11.365
You'd be surprised, is all, you know?

18:14.760 --> 18:17.240
The market on Hylan Boulevard
was a zoo today.

18:17.396 --> 18:19.876
I'm stocking up on frozen food
for Thanksgiving.

18:20.032 --> 18:22.444
I'm thinking of making
a rice stuffing this year...

18:22.602 --> 18:25.412
plus the homemade
cranberry sauce, the rolls...

18:25.571 --> 18:30.111
We know, Roz. You start preparing way in advance.
You tell us every year like it's new information.

18:30.276 --> 18:33.746
I am not Roz to you, I'm your
grandmother. Show some respect.

18:33.913 --> 18:37.986
You can call me Buzozia,
you can call me Noni, Nonni, Nuni.

18:38.150 --> 18:40.630
When you can vote,
you can call me Roz.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.733
Providing you're a Communist,
which in theory was a good idea.

18:44.490 --> 18:46.731
- How's your mother?
- Good.

18:46.892 --> 18:48.394
She's up for parole this summer.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.938
- That's nice.
- She'll get out.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.098
She stole that car but
it was a hybrid.

18:52.598 --> 18:54.771
So you're coming to Thanksgiving,
right, Dorry?

18:54.934 --> 18:56.470
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.515
I'm making my famous
mini-marshmallow sweet potato pie.

18:59.672 --> 19:00.673
Yum.

19:00.840 --> 19:04.413
Oh, Buzuzia, could you get one
of those tofu turkeys for me and Dave?

19:04.577 --> 19:06.955
- We're going vegan.
- Who's Dave?

19:07.113 --> 19:09.821
- Vivian's boyfriend.
- He's not my boyfriend.

19:09.982 --> 19:13.088
Vivian's male friend who is here
constantly eating all the food...

19:13.252 --> 19:16.790
- and sucking face.
- Oh, my God, we do not suck face.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.596
Where'd you meet him?
Is he in your classes with you?

19:19.759 --> 19:21.295
Yeah, we go to the same school.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.133
We're doing <i>The Glass Menagerie.</i>

19:23.295 --> 19:25.866
- He plays the gentleman caller.
- Oh, that's so nice.

19:26.032 --> 19:28.876
- And who do you play?
- I'm operating the light board.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.982
Speaking of gentlemen callers,
what's going on with you, Dorry?

19:32.138 --> 19:33.811
Nothing.

19:33.973 --> 19:37.182
Nothing. Nothing.
I'm getting nowhere with John.

19:37.343 --> 19:40.449
I feel so stupid around him.
It's just not meant to be.

19:40.613 --> 19:43.617
- What's his full name?
- John Fremont.

19:43.783 --> 19:47.356
Love is war, honey.
You need to find common interests.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.660
Melvin and I...
May he rest in peace.

19:51.157 --> 19:52.830
Melvin and I...

19:52.992 --> 19:59.034
Melvin and I... Melvin and I
loved improvisational jazz.

19:59.699 --> 20:03.545
I think you need to find common ground
with this man.

20:03.703 --> 20:08.914
How can I find common ground
when the guy won't even talk to me?

20:09.141 --> 20:11.587
- He's on Facebook.
- Huh?

20:11.911 --> 20:14.517
John Fremont is on Facebook.

20:14.847 --> 20:15.882
See?

20:16.048 --> 20:17.686
He grew up in Chicago.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.158
He went to Syracuse.

20:19.318 --> 20:22.891
He likes yoga, Frisbee, Indian food.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.775
- Roz, he likes Indian food.
- When did you have Indian food?

20:25.925 --> 20:28.872
I didn't,
but I'm sure I'd like it.

20:29.495 --> 20:30.872
- There he is.
- There he is.

20:31.030 --> 20:34.034
- Check this out. Look at that.
- What else? What else? Go on.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.703
We can't see the rest,
we have to be friends with him.

20:36.869 --> 20:40.248
- Well, let's be friends with him.
- No, Doris, it's not like real friends.

20:40.406 --> 20:44.252
We have to make you a profile
and then ask him to befriends.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.890
Oh. No, I can't do that.
I can't do that.

20:47.046 --> 20:49.048
- No.
- Okay.

20:49.215 --> 20:51.456
Then let's make a fake account.
He'll never know.

20:51.617 --> 20:52.857
Yes.

20:53.018 --> 20:55.089
- Okay.
- How about...

20:55.254 --> 20:57.461
- Okay.
- This one?

20:57.623 --> 20:59.569
Oh, this is a very bad idea.

20:59.725 --> 21:01.261
- No, it's not.
- Stop.

21:01.427 --> 21:05.898
Let's see. Find someone who looks like
they have, you know, a master's degree.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.066
Okay.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.210
- Yes. Yes.
- Oh, her?

21:09.368 --> 21:11.279
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah. Totally.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.973
She needs a name.

21:13.139 --> 21:15.483
Lilith Primrose.

21:16.575 --> 21:19.283
I always fantasized my name
would be Lilith Primrose...

21:19.445 --> 21:20.947
if I was in a romance novel.

21:21.113 --> 21:24.151
Or Lilith Comeswell.

21:24.316 --> 21:25.920
Let's just stick with Primrose.

21:26.085 --> 21:28.292
Okay, let's stick with Primrose.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.456
- Let's get you some friends here.
- Oh, yeah?

21:30.623 --> 21:34.503
Because we don't want John thinking
that you're his only friend.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.850
What? What? What happened?

21:53.012 --> 21:54.286
Oh, my God, we're in.

21:54.446 --> 21:55.516
- We're in?
- We got in.

21:55.681 --> 21:56.921
- We're in?
- Yes, look.

21:57.082 --> 21:59.255
Roz. Roz, come quick. We're in.

21:59.418 --> 22:02.262
- I'm in the kitchen. I can't hear you.
- Oh, my God. We're in.

22:02.421 --> 22:04.867
- We're in. Oh, look.
- Look at all this.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.526
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, my gosh.

22:10.296 --> 22:12.867
He rides a bike.

22:13.032 --> 22:16.013
Drinks beer. What else?

22:16.769 --> 22:20.012
Likes dogs.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.515
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

22:25.678 --> 22:29.717
Tapas.

22:30.482 --> 22:36.023
Ahh. "Baby Goya and
the Nuclear Winters."

22:38.791 --> 22:39.861
What?

22:40.025 --> 22:45.407
Oh, "I don't recognize your name.
Have we met?"

22:46.866 --> 22:48.368
Uh...

22:50.169 --> 22:51.170
Okay.

22:51.337 --> 22:53.214
Okay, okay, okay.

22:56.842 --> 22:58.822
Yes.

22:59.712 --> 23:04.559
We met at a party in...

23:05.918 --> 23:07.864
Malibu...

23:08.654 --> 23:10.099
once.

23:29.909 --> 23:33.755
"Oh, okay. Well, see you around."

23:34.546 --> 23:37.425
See you around.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.860
Definitely see you around.

23:41.287 --> 23:43.028
Oh, my God.

23:52.564 --> 23:53.634
Can I help you?

23:53.799 --> 23:56.973
I'm wondering if you have this band.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.116
Baby Goya and the Nuclear Winters.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.080
Electropop. It's cool shit.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.913
- Yeah, cool shit.
- It's over here.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.954
Sure, of course. Cool shit.

Hi, John. I brought you a coffee.

25:22.454 --> 25:26.061
No sugar because I noticed
that's how you like it and...

25:26.225 --> 25:29.035
- That's so cool. Thank you, Doris.
- Who's that, John?

25:29.194 --> 25:32.664
- It's Doris.
- Oh, Doris.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.573
- I should probably go.
- Yeah.

25:35.734 --> 25:38.681
- But thanks for the coffee. All right.
- You're welcome.

25:42.074 --> 25:45.146
Since gay marriage became legal,
it's been like so much pressure.

25:45.310 --> 25:48.086
Everyone's like, "Let's do that."
I don't wanna do that.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.227
Hey, do you guys know Doris?

25:50.549 --> 25:51.926
- Doris?
- Yeah.

25:52.084 --> 25:53.529
- What, from Accounting?
- Yeah.

25:54.486 --> 25:58.559
Uh, kind of. Can you ever
really know someone?

25:58.724 --> 26:01.000
I was dating a girlfriend.
One day, I realized...

26:01.160 --> 26:03.162
I did not even know who she was.

26:03.862 --> 26:06.706
- Who was she?
- No, I mean" I knew who she...

26:06.865 --> 26:09.243
Her name was Jennifer,
but my point is...

26:09.401 --> 26:13.747
- I didn't know who she was.
- She lie to you about her last name?

26:13.906 --> 26:16.079
- No. Who she was.
- You said you didn't know her.

26:16.241 --> 26:19.222
- Her essence. I didn't know...
- What's she like though?

26:19.711 --> 26:20.712
- Are we...?
- Jennifer?

26:20.879 --> 26:25.294
- No, Doris.
- She's, like, a shy person.

26:25.451 --> 26:28.295
- So I don't know. I mean, she's shy.
- How'd she get here?

26:28.454 --> 26:30.798
Oh, she's like a holdover
from the dinosaur ages.

26:30.956 --> 26:34.369
When the company rebranded, we
had to keep some lower-level people...

26:34.526 --> 26:38.099
so she's been doing data entry since
this company was dealing in chinos.

26:38.397 --> 26:41.901
I think she's kind of weird, man.
She has to, like, take a boat to get here.

26:42.067 --> 26:44.104
I think she, like,
lives with her mom, right?

26:44.269 --> 26:47.273
And they're like, you know,
cat ladies or whatever.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.919
- Actually, her mom just passed away.
- Really?

26:50.075 --> 26:52.055
- Yeah, super recently.
- Oh, that's sad.

26:52.744 --> 26:54.655
She was a thousand years old.
It's fine.

26:54.813 --> 26:57.453
Well, she's definitely weird...

26:57.616 --> 27:00.893
but I don't know,
she's like a good weird.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.757
Is that a... ls that a thing?

27:10.129 --> 27:13.133
- Hey, Doris.
- Hey.

27:15.601 --> 27:18.309
Hey, I just wanted to say thank you
for the coffee earlier.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.747
Sorry if I was rude. Anne's been on me
about the December catalog...

27:21.907 --> 27:24.820
since I got here,
and it's been kind of a thing.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.650
No, it's okay.

27:26.812 --> 27:30.589
- I understand.
- Cool. All right.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.526
Is that a Baby Goya
and the Nuclear Winters CD?

27:34.953 --> 27:37.024
- Yes.
- That's my favorite band.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.191
You're kidding.

27:39.358 --> 27:41.804
Wouldn't have thought
you'd be into electronic music.

27:41.960 --> 27:45.032
Oh, I am. I'm a real music person.

27:45.197 --> 27:49.942
I like, you know, electronic
and doowop and show tunes.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.213
You're a baller, Doris.

27:53.639 --> 27:54.845
Straight up.

27:55.941 --> 27:57.545
- Thank you.
- Pound it.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.954
No, pound it.
Put your fist next to mine.

28:02.114 --> 28:04.321
Yeah. Explode it.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.728
Make it rain.

28:11.123 --> 28:12.500
Bye.

28:44.389 --> 28:45.766
- You know what I forgot to do?
- What?

28:45.924 --> 28:47.232
- I forgot to draw. Can I?
- Oh, God.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.531
Just give me a break on this one,
all right?

28:49.695 --> 28:52.005
You didn't draw first?
Or did you just play?

28:52.164 --> 28:54.110
I'm playing now.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.962
Just... Wait, just
forget the rules, okay?

28:56.987 --> 28:57.987
Yeah, okay.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.743
- Forget the rules.
- Forget the rules.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.907
- Forget the rules.
- Would you knock, please?

29:02.074 --> 29:03.951
- Thank you.
- Okay.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.085
- Hello?
- <i>Roz?</i>

29:09.248 --> 29:12.229
- It's me.
- <i>Hey, Dorry.</i>

29:12.384 --> 29:14.921
Look, is Viv around?
Can I talk to her?

29:15.754 --> 29:16.926
Sure. Um...

29:17.089 --> 29:19.296
Yeah, hold on.

29:19.458 --> 29:20.732
Vivi.

29:21.293 --> 29:22.363
Vivian!

29:22.527 --> 29:24.063
- I'll get her.
- No.

29:24.229 --> 29:25.902
- Vivian!
- Vivian!

29:27.399 --> 29:29.037
What?

29:29.201 --> 29:32.614
Pick up the ph...
Pick up the phone.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.309
<i>Why?</i>

29:35.474 --> 29:38.648
Because I asked you
to pick up the phone.

29:38.810 --> 29:40.619
She never listens to me.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.589
- Is she there?
- <i>Fine.</i>

29:44.816 --> 29:46.796
- Great.
- Why does she wanna talk to Vivian?

29:46.952 --> 29:48.158
I don't know.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.300
Why don't we ask her?

29:51.290 --> 29:52.291
Play.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.459
My turn? Do I have to knock
or at the end?

29:54.626 --> 29:57.300
- No, that's at the end.
- Okay. Okay, I'm learning, I'm learning.

29:57.462 --> 29:59.635
<i>Viv, I have
a really important question.</i>

30:01.233 --> 30:03.076
What does "baller" mean?

30:03.669 --> 30:07.082
- Baller?
- Yeah. If someone saris you a baller?

30:07.239 --> 30:10.448
Well, that's really good.
A baller's like a super cool person.

30:10.609 --> 30:13.112
John called me a baller today.

30:13.278 --> 30:16.088
- Doris, he must really like you.
- You know what it was?

30:16.248 --> 30:19.422
I had Baby Goya and
the Nuclear Winters CD on my desk.

30:19.584 --> 30:21.586
- Do you know who they are?
- One sec.

30:21.753 --> 30:25.326
Just because... Yeah, I mean,
you know, it's one of his favorites...

30:25.490 --> 30:27.834
- and so that's why he saw...
- Okay.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.940
Doris, Baby Goya and
the Nuclear Winters is playing...

30:31.096 --> 30:33.133
this Saturday night in Williamsburg.

30:33.298 --> 30:35.141
<i>- You have to go.</i>
- Oh, no, no.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.211
No, no, no. I can't do that.
Williamsburg?

30:37.369 --> 30:40.111
- I'd take a ferry and two trains.
- <i>Doris, It's his favorite band.</i>

30:40.272 --> 30:42.809
- <i>I can't, no. I can't.</i>
- That means he's gonna be there.

30:42.974 --> 30:43.975
This is fate, Doris.

30:44.142 --> 30:46.179
I'm supposed to have dinner
at Todd's house.

30:46.345 --> 30:49.349
That's fine. Just go after.
The concert starts at 10.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.225
<i>Come on, Doris. live a little.</i>

30:51.383 --> 30:55.456
I wouldn't even know
what you wear to a concert.

30:55.620 --> 30:58.567
With electronic music you should
probably just wear, like...

30:58.724 --> 31:02.069
something with bright colors.
Do you own anything neon?

31:02.561 --> 31:04.404
Neon?

31:17.909 --> 31:19.718
Aunt Doris,
can I ask you a question?

31:20.545 --> 31:21.683
Yes, Sawyer.

31:21.847 --> 31:25.852
Do you have a giant pair of shoes
to go with that clown suit?

31:26.017 --> 31:27.257
- Sawyer.
- Enough, you two.

31:27.386 --> 31:31.493
Both of you, just go watch TV
or something. Go on. Go.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.538
They're just being kids, Doris.
They didn't mean anything by it.

31:36.361 --> 31:39.570
I like your outfit.
I think it's a lot of fun.

31:40.098 --> 31:41.771
Thank you.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.618
So, Doris...

31:55.680 --> 31:58.217
how are things going
with Dr. Edwards?

31:58.383 --> 32:01.227
- You making any progress there?
- It's fine. It's fine.

32:01.386 --> 32:03.889
We're gonna clean out the house,
maybe move out.

32:04.055 --> 32:06.695
- No, I'm not planning to do that. No.
- Okay. All right.

32:06.858 --> 32:09.896
Do you realize how selfish
you're being, Doris?

32:10.061 --> 32:12.439
You cannot keep that house
all for yourself.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.304
It belongs to all of us.

32:14.466 --> 32:17.913
It's my home. I've lived in it
my whole life. Todd, it's my home.

32:18.069 --> 32:22.279
Is it too much to ask
that we at least just sell the junk'?

32:22.441 --> 32:26.821
It's not junk, Cindy.
Everything there means something.

32:26.978 --> 32:29.322
How could it possibly
mean anything?

32:29.481 --> 32:32.951
- You live in there like a crazy person.
- All right.

32:33.118 --> 32:37.260
Maybe you're the crazy person and I'm
normal. Did you ever think of that? Hm?

32:37.422 --> 32:38.560
Hm?

32:38.723 --> 32:40.566
I told you
she was gonna act this way.

32:40.725 --> 32:43.262
Why do you have to be confrontational
all the time?

32:43.428 --> 32:45.931
Can't you see
she only wants to help?

32:46.097 --> 32:48.805
- I have to go.
- Where are you gonna go?

32:48.967 --> 32:50.469
To a concert.

32:50.635 --> 32:51.978
A concert?

32:52.137 --> 32:56.415
It's 9:00 o'clock. What, is the Staten Island
Glee Club doing a late show?

32:56.575 --> 33:02.025
No. I'm going to go watch a band called
Baby Goya and the Nuclear Winters.

33:02.180 --> 33:03.591
Ever heard of it?

33:05.283 --> 33:06.284
Huh.

33:11.189 --> 33:12.532
Baby what?

33:32.811 --> 33:35.155
Doris. ls that you?

33:35.981 --> 33:37.483
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.390
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, Gosh, yeah.

33:39.551 --> 33:43.522
I just thought I'd stop by
and, you know, take a peek. I just...

33:43.688 --> 33:45.668
- We don't have to work tomorrow.
- Yeah. No, true.

33:45.824 --> 33:47.497
- Yeah.
- Well...

33:48.527 --> 33:49.801
you look amazing.

33:49.961 --> 33:51.963
Well, thank you, just,
you know, this thing.

33:52.130 --> 33:54.666
I wear it all the time.
Just threw it on. Heh.

33:54.667 --> 33:56.870
Is this your first
Baby Goya show?

33:57.035 --> 33:59.709
It is. I've tried to go before,
but I've been always busy.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.873
He is going to blow your mind.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.678
It's a pretty cool crowd, right?

34:03.842 --> 34:06.482
- Really, really, very cool.
- Great jumpsuit, lady.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.886
- Your outfit is fierce.
- Oh, thank you.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.993
Get in the pose.

36:12.537 --> 36:16.110
- Is he...? No, I think he's done.
- Oh. Oh.

36:16.441 --> 36:19.388
Hey, guys, Baby Goya
wants to meet you.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.224
Come on, let's go.

36:24.382 --> 36:25.486
Okay, wait a minute.

36:50.909 --> 36:53.389
Oh, good, she found you.

36:54.345 --> 36:56.018
- Welcome.
- Man, this is so cool.

36:56.181 --> 36:58.593
I'm such a huge fan, Baby Goya.
I'm John Fremont.

36:58.750 --> 37:01.424
Thanks, bro. Who are you?

37:01.586 --> 37:02.997
Miller, Doris.

37:03.154 --> 37:04.997
M-I-L-L-E-R.

37:05.156 --> 37:07.158
- Doris Miller.
- Hi, Doris Miller.

37:07.325 --> 37:08.827
What'd you think of my show?

37:08.993 --> 37:10.666
And be honest.

37:10.829 --> 37:14.572
It was a little loud in places and I could
have done without the explicit lyrics.

37:14.733 --> 37:17.179
Other than that,
I thought it was wonderful.

37:17.335 --> 37:19.337
I enjoyed it.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.783
- I like you, Doris.
- Why, thank you.

37:26.945 --> 37:29.357
You say what you mean
and you mean what you say.

37:29.514 --> 37:31.187
- Kind of.
- You're a true original.

37:31.349 --> 37:33.109
- I try.
- Niles, what do you think?

37:33.218 --> 37:34.788
She looks fucking sick, dude.

37:34.953 --> 37:36.023
- Right?
- For sure.

37:36.187 --> 37:37.860
- All right.
- Niles and I, We've been looking for...

37:38.022 --> 37:40.798
- a model to be on cover in my new album.
- Oh, good.

37:40.959 --> 37:43.064
It's gonna be called "Fresh Vintage".

37:43.228 --> 37:44.605
- Ooh, that's nice.
- Niles is shooting it.

37:44.763 --> 37:45.969
He's my photographer.

37:46.131 --> 37:48.111
What's up, Doris?
How are you and shit?

37:48.266 --> 37:51.145
- What's happening?
- I'm just fine and shit.

37:51.302 --> 37:53.213
- Just fine.
- That's Niles O'Rourke.

37:53.371 --> 37:55.783
- He's a major fashion photographer.
- Oh, that's nice.

37:55.940 --> 37:58.546
Niles and I love your look, Doris.
Do you wanna do this?

37:59.778 --> 38:02.782
Yeah. Niles, can you get her digits,
we'll have Cassie set it up?

38:02.947 --> 38:05.154
- Get my... Get my what?
- Your digits.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.593
- What?
- It's your fucking phone number.

38:07.752 --> 38:10.096
We need your phone number
to call you and shit.

38:10.255 --> 38:12.166
Okay. Have you got a pencil?

38:13.258 --> 38:16.068
No. Nobody fucking
has pencils anymore.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.433
<i>♪ All the ladies in the place get wild ♪</i>

38:18.630 --> 38:20.507

38:20.732 --> 38:22.769

38:23.935 --> 38:25.015
I make my own vanilla.

38:25.103 --> 38:27.447
Each bottle has a special bean in it.

38:27.605 --> 38:30.814
It's kind of like the worm
in a bottle of tequila...

38:30.975 --> 38:33.751
- except it's not tequila, it's vanilla.
- Oh, that's nice.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.448
And it's not a worm, it's a bean.

38:35.613 --> 38:37.786
- Wonderful.
- And I make my own chocolate bars.

38:37.949 --> 38:41.453
Yeah. Each one's hand-cut
and comes with a haiku in the wrapper.

38:41.619 --> 38:44.259
- That's nice.
- What do you make, Doris?

38:44.422 --> 38:48.632
- I make my own blueberry cornbread.
- Cornbread, that's amazing.

38:48.793 --> 38:52.605
Yeah, well, it comes from a mix
in a box, but I add blueberries in.

38:52.764 --> 38:54.971
- That is such a good idea.
- Yeah.

38:55.133 --> 38:57.204
So how do you fucking know Doris
Or whatever?

38:57.368 --> 38:59.177
Oh, we work together.

38:59.337 --> 39:02.944
Oh, I get it. I totally get it, man.
She's hot. Doris is hot.

39:03.107 --> 39:05.485
No, we're not...
We're not together like that.

39:05.643 --> 39:07.350
We're just...
We're just friends.

39:07.512 --> 39:09.389
Ah, friends with bennies, I hope.

39:11.382 --> 39:12.862
- Friend with benefits. When you fuck...
- No, I get it.

39:12.951 --> 39:15.192
We're just cool, man.
We're just regular friends.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.832
- Oh, I got you, dude.
- Yeah.

39:16.988 --> 39:19.969
I teach at a gay preschool
in Park Slope.

39:20.124 --> 39:21.967
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:22.126 --> 39:26.802
All my kids identify as either lesbian,
gay, bisexual or transgender.

39:26.965 --> 39:29.468
- Well, that's nice.
- Yeah, it's really changed my life.

39:29.634 --> 39:32.376
I mean, like, these little kids
have changed me...

39:32.537 --> 39:34.539
more than I've changed them,
you know?

39:34.706 --> 39:37.710
I dress seasonally and
monochromatically. This fall, I'm pink.

39:37.876 --> 39:41.221
I was thinking about paisley for winter
and white for summer.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.086
What's your method, Doris?

39:43.314 --> 39:45.817
- Oh, I don't have a method.
- Wow.

39:48.486 --> 39:49.829
So, Doris, where do you live?

39:49.988 --> 39:53.197
I live on Staten Island
right near the ferry.

39:53.358 --> 39:54.678
- Wow. Staten Island?
- Yeah.

39:54.759 --> 39:57.330
- That's so first wave.
- It is, yes.

39:57.495 --> 39:58.975
- You're like a pioneer, Doris.
- You know...

39:59.063 --> 40:03.102
I think I was actually the first one
on my block to have cable TV.

40:04.869 --> 40:08.510
You guys, you guys, we should all
leave Williamsburg in a giant bus...

40:08.673 --> 40:10.084
and move to Staten Island.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.845
Yes, oh, my God, yes.

40:12.010 --> 40:14.047
Hey, I wanna make a toast.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.448
To Doris.

40:16.614 --> 40:20.027
- To Doris!
- Whoo!

40:20.251 --> 40:22.026
Thank you.

40:27.892 --> 40:29.462
<i>So things are going well?</i>

40:29.627 --> 40:31.903
<i>I'm having the time of my life.</i>

40:32.063 --> 40:35.704
<i>I mean, these people have really
welcomed me into their world.</i>

40:35.867 --> 40:38.245
<i>It's really something, you know?</i>

40:38.403 --> 40:42.215
<i>Feel like you're ready now
to share a little more with me?</i>

40:42.373 --> 40:44.080
<i>I am. I am. I am.</i>

40:45.410 --> 40:46.912
Tell me about your father.

40:48.212 --> 40:50.385
One morning, we just...

40:51.416 --> 40:54.886
We woke up
and he was gone and, uh...

40:56.721 --> 40:59.167
Well, that was interesting.

41:06.931 --> 41:08.611
Nice. You look fucking tight, Doris.

41:08.766 --> 41:12.077
- No, it's the pants that are tight.
- Hey, let's do this, guys.

41:12.236 --> 41:14.773
Give me fucking beauty,
fucking emotion, all that shit.

41:14.939 --> 41:16.111
Fuck, yeah, Doris.

41:16.274 --> 41:18.811
Give it to me, Doris.
Yes. Give me hot.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.787
You know, fucking steamy
like dance the music.

41:21.946 --> 41:24.825
You know, it's like, "I'm claiming".
Doris, that is so sick.

41:24.983 --> 41:28.829
That's so tight. That's so sick.
That's so tight, Doris.

41:30.455 --> 41:36.428
Nikki was smart and funny, and one day
she just up and broke up with me.

41:36.594 --> 41:38.835
She did it over text.
Do you wanna see it?

41:39.430 --> 41:40.966
Right there.

41:42.367 --> 41:46.110
It sucks because I just feel like
I don't know what went wrong.

41:46.604 --> 41:48.845
Maybe she thought I was boring.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.615
I get nervous
that I'm boring sometimes.

41:53.778 --> 41:56.019
I don't think you're boring, John.

41:56.180 --> 41:57.181
Thank you.

41:57.782 --> 41:59.989
I just want people to like me.

42:00.151 --> 42:01.994
Yeah.

42:03.654 --> 42:04.724
What about you, Doris?

42:04.889 --> 42:07.233
- What?
- You ever been in love?

42:08.393 --> 42:11.966
- I don't know. Heh.
- You don't know?

42:12.630 --> 42:13.665
- I don't know.
- Come on.

42:13.831 --> 42:17.540
I feel like I just spilled my guts
on the floor to you with this...

42:17.702 --> 42:20.046
It's your turn. I'd like to know.

42:20.972 --> 42:22.679
- I was engaged once.
- Were you really?

42:22.840 --> 42:24.877
Yeah, I really was.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.215
I really was.

42:28.079 --> 42:30.582
I was in my early 20s
and his name was Arthur.

42:30.748 --> 42:33.729
And he was a journalism student
at city college...

42:33.885 --> 42:37.094
and we met at a bar in the Village
and I was with my friend Roz...

42:37.255 --> 42:40.862
and he was with his friend Peter,
and they ordered drinks...

42:41.025 --> 42:44.905
and then sat down at our table with us
and we just talked and talked and talked.

42:45.063 --> 42:50.741
And he loved folk music
and foreign films...

42:50.902 --> 42:54.850
and he had brown eyes...

42:55.006 --> 42:58.112
and a big smile and...

42:59.944 --> 43:02.220
We just spent
every moment together...

43:02.380 --> 43:05.918
and he took me to all these
foreign films that were really weird.

43:06.084 --> 43:07.529
And... Heh.

43:07.685 --> 43:11.428
And then one night, he was taking me
home on the ferry, and it was bumpy.

43:11.589 --> 43:13.569
I remember it was really rocky
and bumpy...

43:13.724 --> 43:17.297
and he got down on one knee
and then... And he fell over.

43:17.462 --> 43:23.140
And we laughed and then
he took out a little ring...

43:23.601 --> 43:27.208
and he asked me to marry him
and I said "Yes".

43:27.738 --> 43:29.547
And...

43:30.575 --> 43:34.921
then he got a job, uh,
working on a newspaper...

43:35.079 --> 43:40.222
in Flagstaff, Arizona, of all places,
and he asked me to go with him.

43:40.985 --> 43:42.658
And, uh...

43:43.421 --> 43:44.798
I couldn't leave my mother.

43:44.956 --> 43:49.427
It would have killed her
to leave her alone.

43:51.095 --> 43:54.736
And he left and I stayed,
and that's that.

43:59.437 --> 44:01.439
I'm... I'm sorry.

44:02.106 --> 44:03.483
It's okay.

44:12.083 --> 44:13.858
Thank you for walking me to the train.

44:14.018 --> 44:17.795
Yeah, I mean, of course. I can't believe
you have to take a ferry after this too.

44:17.955 --> 44:20.629
Well, that's all right. I'm used to it.

44:21.125 --> 44:22.661
I had a really good time tonight.

44:22.827 --> 44:24.500
It's just nice talking to you.

44:24.662 --> 44:26.539
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

44:26.697 --> 44:28.608
I like you, Doris. Okay.

44:33.104 --> 44:34.447
I got you a little bit there.

44:34.605 --> 44:36.107
- A little bit.
- Sorry.

44:36.274 --> 44:38.311
Okay, good night.

44:53.824 --> 44:54.825
You look different.

44:56.194 --> 44:57.195
Do I?

44:59.397 --> 45:00.842
Thank you.

45:01.065 --> 45:03.136
Okay, thank you.

45:04.335 --> 45:07.179
Do you think that sometime
you might be willing to let me...

45:07.338 --> 45:11.184
come over and look at your house?
How about I come this weekend?

45:14.545 --> 45:16.388
Oh, that's so cool.

45:17.148 --> 45:19.424
- You look great.
- Oh, stop.

45:19.850 --> 45:22.353
Are you guys, like, together now?

45:22.520 --> 45:25.524
Viv, please.

45:28.392 --> 45:31.601
Well, I'm not saying anything,
but we did kiss.

45:31.762 --> 45:33.605
Doris.

45:33.764 --> 45:37.268
It was accidental, but I felt a spark.

45:37.435 --> 45:40.211
So when are you gonna see him next?
When's your next date?

45:40.371 --> 45:44.285
Well, I'll see him at the office next week.
I'm sure we'll set up something.

45:44.442 --> 45:47.013
Just be careful, okay?

45:47.178 --> 45:48.282
What do you mean?

45:48.446 --> 45:50.619
I mean just what I said. Be careful.

45:50.781 --> 45:53.955
You appear to be taking dating advice
from a 13-year-old.

45:54.118 --> 45:56.724
I don't wanna see you get hurt,
that's all.

45:56.887 --> 45:59.731
- I can handle myself.
- Mm-hm.

46:00.758 --> 46:03.432
"I don't want you to get hurt."

46:08.366 --> 46:11.142
- John.
- Oh, hey, Doris.

46:11.302 --> 46:13.805
- Hi.
- I had so much fun the other night.

46:14.272 --> 46:18.550
Oh, it was, wasn't it?
Yes, it was.

46:18.709 --> 46:22.555
You wanna have lunch together outside
in the park? It's a really warm, lovely day.

46:22.713 --> 46:25.887
I know, I was out earlier,
but, um, I'm super backed up.

46:26.050 --> 46:28.621
I think I'm gonna work through lunch.
But maybe later...

46:28.786 --> 46:30.993
we can get a coffee or something,
yeah? Okay?

46:31.155 --> 46:34.159
- Yeah.
- Okay. Bye.

46:35.159 --> 46:38.106
If you could close the door
on the way out, that'd be great.

46:38.262 --> 46:39.969
Goodbye.

46:40.131 --> 46:42.839
I'll just be closing the door.
The door is closing.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.742
Closing the door.

46:50.574 --> 46:51.985
John. John.

46:52.143 --> 46:54.123
Hey, John.
You know, I meant to tell you.

46:54.278 --> 46:57.020
I saw the funniest thing
on the ferry this morning.

46:57.181 --> 47:00.253
Doris, no, I would love to chat
but I'm gonna be late for a thing.

47:00.418 --> 47:01.658
- We'll talk tomorrow.
- Okay.

47:01.819 --> 47:03.355
All right.

47:26.977 --> 47:29.355
- Hey, Doris.
- John, hi.

47:29.513 --> 47:31.288
- Hey.
- Hi.

47:31.449 --> 47:33.190
Is everything okay?

47:33.351 --> 47:34.989
Yeah, why?

47:35.152 --> 47:38.292
I feel like we've barely had a chance
to speak all week.

47:38.456 --> 47:41.528
You've been kind of distracted.

47:41.692 --> 47:44.730
Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't know,
it's just been a really crazy week.

47:44.895 --> 47:47.000
Yeah. That's okay.

47:47.198 --> 47:48.370
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

47:48.566 --> 47:50.910
I read in the paper
about this new restaurant...

47:51.068 --> 47:54.379
where they serve all their food
in the dark. It's called Dark.

47:54.538 --> 47:57.314
It's about taste and texture
because you cant see the food.

47:57.475 --> 48:01.218
- It's like tasting, touching.
- Yeah, sounds interesting.

48:01.379 --> 48:04.087
- We should go sometime.
- Yes, please, let's do that.

48:04.248 --> 48:06.250
- How about tonight?
- Tonight I can't.

48:06.417 --> 48:08.693
- But at some point, sure.
- Yeah.

48:08.853 --> 48:10.389
- Okay.
- Okay.

48:10.554 --> 48:12.158
- All right.
- Okay.

48:12.323 --> 48:14.064
Okay.

48:22.867 --> 48:25.370
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

48:27.371 --> 48:28.941
- For me?
- Yeah.

48:29.106 --> 48:30.176
It's so cute.

48:30.341 --> 48:32.048
Made it with paper
from the paper shredder.

48:32.209 --> 48:34.416
Thank you. It's lovely.

48:34.578 --> 48:36.524
- How was work?
- It was okay.

48:39.884 --> 48:42.057
- I'm a little worried about my roommate.
- What?

48:42.219 --> 48:45.723
She stopped going to a therapist
and she's seeing a psychic instead.

48:45.890 --> 48:48.598
- A psychic?
- I know, it's ridiculous, right?

48:48.759 --> 48:50.739
She swears by it though. I'm like:

48:50.895 --> 48:53.774
"What does my therapist do for me?"
I mean, I just like...

49:00.070 --> 49:02.311
- You cried during <i>Home Alone?</i>
- Yes.

49:02.473 --> 49:06.615
The part when Kevin looks inside and he
sees that family celebrating Christmas.

49:06.777 --> 49:09.986
And he's all alone. I wanna cry right now
just thinking about it.

49:11.415 --> 49:14.555
- Oh, you find that funny?
- A little bit.

49:20.658 --> 49:22.831
- Do you think you'll live here forever?
- Where?

49:22.993 --> 49:25.337
- Here in New York.
- In New Yor... Uh, I don't know.

49:25.496 --> 49:28.909
Not in this store,
but in New York City.

49:48.519 --> 49:49.964
Doris?

49:50.321 --> 49:52.096
- Hey.
- John.

49:52.256 --> 49:55.931
- What are you doing here?
- I... Um... Love this store.

49:56.093 --> 50:00.098
I love this store.
I come to this store a lot.

50:00.264 --> 50:01.607
- Okay.
- Okay.

50:01.765 --> 50:04.302
Hey, Brooklyn, this is Doris.
Doris, this is Brooklyn.

50:04.468 --> 50:05.606
Remember I told you about her?
She's my co-worker.

50:05.769 --> 50:07.715
- Oh, yeah. It's so nice to meet you.
- Yes.

50:07.872 --> 50:11.046
- Brooklyn, you... Are you from Brooklyn?
- Oh, no. I'm from Colorado.

50:11.208 --> 50:13.711
My parents named me that
because they love Woody Allen.

50:13.878 --> 50:16.051
Why didn't they name you Woody Allen,
you know?

50:16.280 --> 50:19.557
Ha! That's hilarious.
John told me you were so funny.

50:19.717 --> 50:22.891
I have to go. I have to catch the ferry.
So it was nice meeting you.

50:23.053 --> 50:24.253
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah.

50:24.388 --> 50:27.801
We're gonna go to Café Kalen and get
some dessert if you wanna come with.

50:27.958 --> 50:29.460
Brooks is gonna sing some songs.

50:29.627 --> 50:33.336
It's my first time performing them
in front of an audience so I'm super nervous.

50:33.497 --> 50:34.999
- Yeah. Wanna come?
- No, I really...

50:35.165 --> 50:38.738
The ferry's late and then it gets choppy,
and I really have to...

50:38.903 --> 50:42.544
- Please come. I could use the support.
- Yeah, come on, Doris. Come with us.

51:50.874 --> 51:54.583

51:54.745 --> 51:56.533
I like your sweater.
It's nice.

51:56.558 --> 51:59.184
Thank you. I actually...
I knit it myself.

51:59.316 --> 52:01.762
- Really?
- Yeah. Do you knit?

52:01.919 --> 52:05.162
Yes. Yes, I do knit little squares
of things.

52:05.322 --> 52:08.132
Oh, my God, you have to come

52:08.292 --> 52:10.898
That's very nice of you.
Thank you.

52:11.061 --> 52:13.632
I joined the LGBT knitting community
five years ago...

52:13.797 --> 52:16.073
and I cannot imagine my life
without it now.

52:16.233 --> 52:21.012
I'm not a lesbian, but I'm me there.
You know?

52:22.172 --> 52:24.743
Brooklyn, you know,
I feel that way in Staples.

52:24.908 --> 52:26.581

52:26.744 --> 52:29.088

It's a date.

52:32.249 --> 52:34.354

Hey, Doris?

54:55.759 --> 54:57.466
Sis?

54:58.262 --> 55:00.003
Doris?

55:00.164 --> 55:02.235
It's Dr. Edwards.

55:02.399 --> 55:04.606
Come on, open up, sis.

55:05.636 --> 55:08.276
Doris, please open the door.

55:08.438 --> 55:10.145
Sis?

55:10.507 --> 55:12.180
I know she's in there.

55:12.342 --> 55:15.152
- First visit in the house?
- Yeah. Ours.

55:19.283 --> 55:22.696
Hi, Doris. It's Dr. Edwards.

55:22.853 --> 55:24.196
Can we come in?

55:24.354 --> 55:27.961
Sis, just let us in, Doris.

55:37.100 --> 55:38.443
- Hi, Doris.
- Hey.

55:39.336 --> 55:41.213
It's good to see you again.

55:41.371 --> 55:43.442
- Hey.
- Hey.

55:50.113 --> 55:54.823
Oh, my God, Doris,
it is so gross in here.

55:54.985 --> 55:57.727
You need to take all this garbage
and burn it in a Dumpster.

55:57.888 --> 55:59.890
Cynthia, that's not helpful.

56:00.624 --> 56:04.299
Okay, well, I'll just sit in a corner
and keep my mouth shut.

56:04.461 --> 56:07.999
You know, she's gonna look around,
okay? Just gonna look around.

56:08.165 --> 56:12.545
So, Doris, we'll start
by creating three piles.

56:12.703 --> 56:14.979
One for trash.

56:15.138 --> 56:17.015
One to donate.

56:17.174 --> 56:19.176
And one to keep.

56:19.576 --> 56:23.422
Doris, it's totally up to you to decide
what you wanna keep...

56:23.580 --> 56:27.653
and what you're willing to let go of.
Okay? Should we give it a shot?

56:27.818 --> 56:29.195
- Okay.
- Great.

56:29.353 --> 56:31.890
Okay, let's start here
in the dining room.

56:32.055 --> 56:34.831
How about this wooden ski?

56:34.992 --> 56:37.836
Would you like to keep it,
discard it or donate it to charity?

56:38.395 --> 56:40.534
Well, the Wallaces gave us that.

56:40.697 --> 56:43.678
They lived across the street
before they moved to Montreal.

56:43.834 --> 56:48.249
I liked them very much.
And I wanna keep that. I wanna keep it.

56:48.405 --> 56:50.112
Where's the other one?

56:50.908 --> 56:54.515
- I'm not sure.
- You can't go skiing with one ski, Doris.

56:54.678 --> 56:57.887
- All right, then we will donate it.
- Good.

56:58.048 --> 57:03.259
I don't wanna throw it away.
I don't want it to end up in a landfill.

57:03.420 --> 57:04.922
Somebody... Oh!

57:05.555 --> 57:09.799
Take care of it.
It has sentimental value.

57:09.960 --> 57:15.467
What is the point of donating that?
Who's gonna look for only one ski?

57:15.632 --> 57:19.603
- Someone with one leg.
- Oh, you think you're so clever.

57:19.770 --> 57:22.614
Cynthia, please.
This is difficult for Doris.

57:22.773 --> 57:25.652
- Try to be patient.
- Fine.

57:26.743 --> 57:27.778
Great, Doris.

57:28.645 --> 57:31.888
This should give you a sense
of the way it works.

57:32.049 --> 57:35.258
Do you wanna try another one?
How about...?

57:36.820 --> 57:40.267
- How about these magazines here?
- Um...

57:40.457 --> 57:42.164
- Donate.
- Good.

57:42.326 --> 57:45.466
No, no, actually, I changed my mind.

57:45.629 --> 57:48.769
I'm thinking that I would really like
to finish them one day.

57:48.932 --> 57:50.240
- Fine.
- Yeah.

57:50.400 --> 57:52.937
- That's no problem.
- Okay.

57:54.671 --> 57:57.151
- How about these empty containers?
- Keep.

57:57.307 --> 57:59.753
- Keep? Are you sure?
- Keep. Yes. Yes.

57:59.910 --> 58:03.983
I feel that they're going
to be very useful at one point.

58:04.982 --> 58:08.589
What about this, uh, bowl
of shampoo bottles'?

58:08.752 --> 58:10.527
- Keep. Yes.
- Really?

58:10.687 --> 58:12.030
- Doris?
- Yes. Keep.

58:12.189 --> 58:15.659
- You think you'll need shampoo bottles?
- There may be a shortage...

58:15.826 --> 58:19.035
and then people have to come to me
for shampoo, and I really...

58:19.196 --> 58:23.201
- What? What are you doing? No, no, no.
- I am getting rid of useless... Ow!

58:23.367 --> 58:27.281
No, no, no. This is something I want.
This means something to me.

58:27.437 --> 58:30.008
- This means something...
- She's lost her mind.

58:30.173 --> 58:32.483
No, no, no!

58:32.676 --> 58:35.054
No, no, no!

58:35.278 --> 58:36.655
No, no, no!

58:36.847 --> 58:41.819
It's my stuff and Mom's stuff.
This is my house. It's my house.

58:41.985 --> 58:43.987
You go! You go! You go!

58:44.154 --> 58:46.464
- You leave! You leave! You leave!
- Okay. Let's go.

58:46.623 --> 58:48.899
- Go. Go. Go on. You go.
- Come on.

58:49.059 --> 58:52.973
- Leave.
- We'll try this again another time, okay?

58:58.402 --> 59:01.076
I'm disappointed in you, Doris.

59:05.575 --> 59:06.747
You're...

59:06.910 --> 59:10.915
- You're disappointed in me?
- Mm-hm.

59:12.249 --> 59:14.889
You're disappointed in me?

59:15.052 --> 59:16.861
Todd, where were you?

59:17.020 --> 59:19.000
Where were you all those years?

59:19.156 --> 59:24.902
All those years, I took care of her.
I fed her, I clothed her.

59:25.062 --> 59:30.842
I took care of her. Where were you?
Where were you?

59:31.334 --> 59:33.712
We made an agreement, Doris. Huh?

59:34.771 --> 59:37.411
You were in the best position
to take care of her.

59:37.574 --> 59:42.523
And how else would I have gone to
school, start my own business? How?

59:42.679 --> 59:46.957
You agreed to that.
We agreed to that.

59:47.117 --> 59:49.222
I could have had those things.

59:49.386 --> 59:52.367
I could have had them too.

59:52.689 --> 59:54.032
I could have...

59:56.593 --> 01:00:01.064
- Oh, please.
- Cynthia, just...

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:03.700
Give me a minute.
Give me a minute with her.

01:00:03.867 --> 01:00:05.642
Please, give me a minute with her.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:12.883
You have to get away from here, Doris.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:17.448
You're turning into her.

01:00:18.882 --> 01:00:22.830
You're holding on to stuff because
you're telling yourself you might need it.

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:25.660
Someday, you might.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:30.131
I don't know,
maybe you're just scared.

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:33.066
You're lonely.

01:00:34.331 --> 01:00:36.402
I don't know why.

01:00:38.068 --> 01:00:42.175
But I know
that you gotta get out of here.

01:01:00.257 --> 01:01:03.101
- Can we not do this at work?
- We're doing this right now.

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:05.262
I don't care if you're at work or not.

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:07.305
Looks like
there's trouble in paradise.

01:01:07.464 --> 01:01:09.637
Stop lying. I see it on your face.

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:18.944
Asshole!

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:29.459
I never liked her.

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:31.621
Cute shoes though.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:35.465
You're probably wondering
what happened between me and John.

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:39.869
No. No. I didn't... You know,
if you wanna talk about it, I'm here.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:43.477
Yeah, well, it's over between us.
It's donzo.

01:01:43.667 --> 01:01:44.805
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:01:44.968 --> 01:01:47.380
- Why?
- Because he's a fucking liar.

01:01:47.571 --> 01:01:51.178
I'm so stupid. He told me I was the only
woman he was dating, but he's lying.

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:52.911
- It's obvious.
- Who's he seeing?

01:01:53.076 --> 01:01:54.885
Some girl, Lilith Primrose.

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:58.315
She has a master's degree.

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:01.723
- Do you know her?
- No.

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:04.764
Well. she posted some weird love shit
on his Facebook wall...

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:07.492
so I confronted him about it.
They're totally having sex.

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:10.900
- No. No, no, no.
- Yeah. I asked him, "Who is this chick?"

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:13.769
He's like, "I have no idea."
But I can tell he's lying.

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:17.434
It was all over his face.
I've been hurt in the past, so...

01:02:17.601 --> 01:02:19.342
Once bitten, twice shy, you know?

01:02:19.502 --> 01:02:22.711
- Twice shy, I know.
- So anyway, it's done.

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:25.546
But I'm really glad I met you.
You're so cool, Doris.

01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:32.116
<i>Doris, listen, it's John.
Are you around today?</i>

01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:35.120
It's just so weird, Doris.

01:02:35.285 --> 01:02:37.265
She kept asking me
who Lilith Primrose was.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:41.300
And I was like, "I have no idea."
But she never believed me.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:47.097
I was cleaning out my closet last night.
I found a pair of Brooklyn's jeans.

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:49.972
- Yes.
- I was so depressed, I put them on.

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:52.269
I'm wearing them right now.

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:55.905
- They fit me perfectly.
- Yes, yes, they do.

01:02:56.373 --> 01:02:58.114
Anyway...

01:02:58.475 --> 01:03:00.455
it's over now.

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:04.490
Oh, John, I'm so sorry. I wish
there was something I could do to help.

01:03:04.648 --> 01:03:07.254
No, you are helping, Doris. I just...

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:09.795
I just wanna be surrounded
by friends right now.

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:12.229
Okay, good. Good.

01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:14.995
Hey, what are you doing
for Thanksgiving?

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.437
Nothing, really. Just...

01:03:18.595 --> 01:03:21.235
Yeah, I'm having an orphan
Thanksgiving over at my place.

01:03:21.398 --> 01:03:24.106
I'm gonna invite everybody
I've met since I moved out here.

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:27.646
Plus my friend Sasha's in town
from L.A...

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:31.308
and she's gonna sage the apartment.
I don't know, hit a gong and stuff.

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:33.784
Get rid of some of that
bad breakup karma.

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:35.820
- She's a healer.
- Oh.

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:37.958
Will you come?

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:41.459
- Sure. Sure. I'll come. Yes.
- Great.

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:44.957
- Hey, Doris, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:47.761
Would you ever consider
dating a younger man?

01:03:48.358 --> 01:03:50.338
Just curious.

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:52.329
Yes.

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:54.099
Cool.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.173
Come on.

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:03.014
Oh, my God, Doris, it's on.
It's, like, so on.

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:05.278
Really, really, really, you think it is?

01:04:05.442 --> 01:04:10.619
Doris, I don't think, I know.
This is it. It's your moment.

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:12.520
I'm so happy for you.

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:17.658
Doris, Thanksgiving is our special time.
It's like... It's a tradition, Doris.

01:04:17.821 --> 01:04:20.961
I can't believe you're doing this.
I'm making two kinds of stuffing.

01:04:21.124 --> 01:04:24.469
Roz, this is my big opportunity.
It's my chance to be with John.

01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:26.463
Can you be honest with yourself?

01:04:26.629 --> 01:04:30.076
- He's barely old enough to vote.
- He probably votes more than you do.

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:33.009
I am a conscientious objector.
That's different.

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:36.173
Oh, Roz, honestly, I just don't think
this is this big a deal.

01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:38.341
You are not like them.
Don't you get that?

01:04:38.508 --> 01:04:41.011
Why are you doing this?
You were so supportive to me before.

01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:43.054
I'm having a rare moment of clarity.

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:47.662
Maybe you're just jealous because I'm having fun
doing things with other people and not just you.

01:04:47.817 --> 01:04:49.490
You wish!

01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:50.926
Roz.

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:55.661
Roz, there has got to be more to life
than going to lectures at the YWCA...

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:57.930
and stealing cheese.

01:04:58.094 --> 01:05:00.665
I mean, your husband died.
He died, it was tragic.

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:06.542
But that was 15 years ago!
Move the fuck on!

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:09.873
You're telling me to move on?

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:14.249
You have packets of duck sauce
in your refrigerator from the 1970s.

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:18.951
- It keeps.
- Oh, honey. Darling, don't you see?

01:05:19.115 --> 01:05:22.119
You're just a weird little old lady
in the funny clothes to them!

01:05:22.285 --> 01:05:26.290
You're like their weird
fucking art project!

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:30.894
- You take that back.
- Doris, I'm worried about you.

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:34.530
You are not my mother.
My mother is dead.

01:05:34.697 --> 01:05:41.239
So you can stop worrying about me.
I can take care of myself!

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:49.080
I don't steal cheese.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:52.320
That cheese is free.

01:05:53.583 --> 01:05:56.063
<i>What action could you take today...</i>

01:05:56.219 --> 01:06:01.100
<i>that will help you achieve the success
in life that you desire?</i>

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:11.841
<i>If everything you do works,
then you're not trying hard enough.</i>

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:15.582
<i>Let there be light.</i>

01:06:15.738 --> 01:06:17.308
<i>Say it with me.</i>

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:20.284
<i>Let there be light.</i>

01:06:20.443 --> 01:06:23.253
<i>You're possible, Doris.</i>

01:06:23.413 --> 01:06:25.586
<i>You are possible.</i>

01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:33.466
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

01:07:00.283 --> 01:07:01.990
Whoo!

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.324
Whoo!

01:07:08.157 --> 01:07:10.364
- Hey, Doris, you made it.
- Yes.

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:11.904
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:15.742
- Oh, I made a pie.
- Nice.

01:07:15.899 --> 01:07:17.173
- John?
- Yeah.

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:19.472
I would like to talk to you
about something.

01:07:19.636 --> 01:07:21.809
Sure. Let me introduce you
to everybody first.

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:26.215
Come on up. Hey, Doris made a pie,
everyone. Doris made a pie.

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:32.515
- Doris.
- Yes.

01:07:32.682 --> 01:07:34.218
Try this. It's a Thanks-tini.

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:37.695
My mixologist friend Oliver designed it
specifically for the party.

01:07:37.854 --> 01:07:39.134
- Oh.
- Everybody, this is Doris.

01:07:40.423 --> 01:07:43.700
- Of course, you know all these guys.
- Hi, Doris. You look beautiful.

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:47.933
- Thank you.
- This is Keith. We just met on Grindr.

01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:49.770
- How nice.
- I know nothing about him.

01:07:49.933 --> 01:07:52.413
And over there is my Uncle Frank.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:55.880
- Frank is in sales.
- Belts and buckles, to be exact.

01:07:58.675 --> 01:07:59.710
Big buckler.

01:07:59.876 --> 01:08:02.254
Let's give thanks for our families.

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:06.053
Those of us who are here
and those of us who are gone forever.

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:07.285
We miss you, Melvin.

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:11.455
And those of us who are in prison, we
hope that the food there does not suck.

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:16.434
And let's give thanks for friends
who are here instead of someplace else.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:19.130
Friends who have not
abandoned us.

01:08:19.295 --> 01:08:21.969
Friends who have not betrayed us
in our hour of need...

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:26.636
and run off with some hot piece
of whatever.

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:28.874
And let's eat some turkey.

01:08:29.037 --> 01:08:30.813
- Let's.
- Yeah.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.478
Hey. Pretty lady.

01:08:34.644 --> 01:08:37.386
You know, I'm really excited
to chat with you tonight.

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:38.548
Thanks.

01:08:38.715 --> 01:08:40.752
If everybody could listen up
for a second...

01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:44.057
Fiona made the turkey tonight.

01:08:44.654 --> 01:08:47.930
I got dibs on the drumstick.
The drumsticks mine.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.465
You know this has been
a really difficult time for me.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:54.734
I wanted to say how thankful I am
for each and every one of you.

01:08:54.897 --> 01:08:56.569
You guys are the stuff of life.

01:08:56.733 --> 01:08:58.337
- I'm nothing without you.
- Aw...

01:08:58.501 --> 01:09:00.845
- To my awesome friends.
- Cheers.

01:09:01.004 --> 01:09:03.848
- Cheers.
- Eye contact. Eye contact.

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:05.077
Salud, yes.

01:09:06.843 --> 01:09:08.515
So, they say Miss Sheehan fell...

01:09:08.678 --> 01:09:11.750
but everyone knows
she's got a drinking problem.

01:09:11.913 --> 01:09:13.916
So we've had this sub
for like three weeks.

01:09:14.082 --> 01:09:15.653
And his name is Mr. Durphy...

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:20.698
but everyone calls him Dorky Durphy
because he's super weird. Anyways...

01:09:20.857 --> 01:09:25.169
I ride the thing for 15 minutes
before I realize it wasn't my horse.

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:27.501
It wasn't my horse.
Ha-ha-ha!

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:30.202
"Western wolf...

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:32.671
...night sky.

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:37.113
Our naked bodies
twitching under cover of darkness.

01:09:37.273 --> 01:09:39.149
Thread count...

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:42.455
- ...unknown."
- That was brilliant.

01:09:42.612 --> 01:09:45.183
I just feel like my work
has changed so much since...

01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:48.488
Who wants mint chocolate chip
flavored alcohol? Just 10 calories.

01:09:48.885 --> 01:09:51.058
- We should play Never Have I Ever.
- Oh, yes.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.723
- All right?
- What is that?

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:55.370
- It's a drinking game, Doris.
- Okay.

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:59.132
You say the phrase "never have I ever"
and then something crazy...

01:09:59.295 --> 01:10:01.639
and anybody that's done it
has to drink.

01:10:01.798 --> 01:10:04.472
Here, I'll start Never have I ever...

01:10:04.634 --> 01:10:08.047
participated in an orgy.

01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:13.084
- All right, jump right in, huh?
- Who's gonna drink?

01:10:13.242 --> 01:10:14.721
Anybody?

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.717
Nice.

01:10:20.016 --> 01:10:22.895
- My first semester at Oberlin.
- Don't apologize.

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:24.759
Oh, really? At your age?

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:27.733
- Doris?
- What?

01:10:28.157 --> 01:10:29.534
- You go now.
- Oh, all right.

01:10:29.692 --> 01:10:34.038
Say "never have I ever"
and then something crazy.

01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:36.276
Okay.

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:42.082
Never have I ever...

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:47.916
gone to work with my underwear
inside out on purpose. Whoa!

01:10:49.879 --> 01:10:53.725
- Okay.
- Bad idea.

01:10:56.853 --> 01:10:58.423
You're not alone, Doris.

01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:01.967
- Talk about a bad idea.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:11:02.125 --> 01:11:07.097
Well, never have I ever had sex
with my psychiatrist in high school.

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:10.135
- Wow.
- I was a cutter.

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:12.370
Everybody grows out of that.

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:14.240
Great, great.

01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:16.041
I can't get through to her.

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:18.412
- Who?
- Doris.

01:11:18.574 --> 01:11:21.418
- Don't be so hard on her.
- It's like somebody...

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:24.217
stole my friend and replaced her
with a wild animal...

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:26.656
who stays up all night...

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:29.160
and sleeps all day
and wears too much makeup...

01:11:29.318 --> 01:11:31.730
and runs around
with other wild animals.

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:36.896
Let her be, Roz. Just let her be.
Let her live her life.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:41.832
Besides, she's just a kid.

for a minute, in the bedroom.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.846
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:28.648

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:27.741
Heh.

01:13:31.674 --> 01:13:34.018
It's been fun tonight, right?

01:13:34.944 --> 01:13:38.187
- Yes.
- What's up?

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:40.189
John...

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:43.393
from the first moment
we met in the elevator...

01:13:43.552 --> 01:13:45.691
your first day in the office...

01:13:45.855 --> 01:13:49.268
I felt this energy between us.

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:51.769
In the beginning,
I thought we were just friends...

01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:55.137
because girls like you aren't
usually interested in boys like me.

01:13:55.298 --> 01:13:56.641
- Doris.
- You know what I mean.

01:13:56.799 --> 01:13:59.973
You know what I mean.
You know what I mean.

01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:03.143
And then I realized
you were with Brooklyn and I...

01:14:03.306 --> 01:14:05.377
- Can I just say something?
- No.

01:14:06.142 --> 01:14:08.452
Then you broke up...

01:14:09.145 --> 01:14:12.092
and I felt really bad about writing...

01:14:12.248 --> 01:14:14.455
that silly comment
on your Facebook thing...

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:18.929
but then you asked me
if I would ever date a younger man...

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:21.762
and I...

01:14:21.924 --> 01:14:23.597
I knew you felt the same way...

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:28.230
and I... I just like you, John.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:31.907
John.

01:14:32.068 --> 01:14:33.775
No.

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:38.146
Doris, no.

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:43.950
- Doris, I can't.
- What? You...

01:14:44.113 --> 01:14:45.956
And what is that about
the Facebook page?

01:14:46.115 --> 01:14:48.356
What, did you post something
on my Facebook page!

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:50.155
- I did. I'm sorry.
- That was you?

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:51.627
That was me. I'm sorry.

01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:55.462
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't know.

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:58.161
- I liked Brooklyn. What are you...?
- I don't understand.

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:00.273
- Why did you do this?
- I don't understand.

01:15:00.429 --> 01:15:03.774
Why did you say that to me? Why did
you say, would I date a younger man?

01:15:03.933 --> 01:15:10.646
I don't understand. Why did you say that
to me if you didn't feel anything at all?

01:15:10.806 --> 01:15:15.050
I wasn't talking about me, Doris.
I was talking about my Uncle Frank.

01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:19.223
He's like 56 years old or something.
I don't know.

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:24.229
Hi. Is everything okay in here?

01:15:24.387 --> 01:15:26.162
Yeah, everything...

01:15:26.322 --> 01:15:28.962
- Everything's fine.
- Okay.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.998
Okay.

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:35.507

- Oh, honey.
- I'm such a fool.

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:49.131
Oh, don't, don't. Don't do that.
What happened?

01:17:49.298 --> 01:17:50.800
No one even ate my pie.

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:53.879
- Oh, honey, what?
- Yeah.

01:17:54.036 --> 01:17:57.381
Are you hungry? I brought leftovers.

01:17:57.806 --> 01:18:01.049
Come on, let's sit down
and I'll make some coffee.

01:18:02.478 --> 01:18:05.288
- How was the dinner?
- Not the best.

01:18:05.447 --> 01:18:09.224
- What time did everybody leave?
- We missed you.

01:18:09.652 --> 01:18:11.632
All right, just coffee,
just black?

01:18:11.787 --> 01:18:14.233
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:18:16.959 --> 01:18:20.907
I'm just a joke to him. I'm a joke
to everyone. What is the matter with me?

01:18:21.063 --> 01:18:25.034
Nothing is the matter with you.
You got carried away, that's all.

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:27.875
Love makes people
do crazy things.

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:31.507
Look at it this way.
At least you didn't lose an ear.

01:18:32.474 --> 01:18:35.148
You know, like that...
The painter, what's-his-name.

01:18:35.311 --> 01:18:37.382
- Vincent van Gogh?
- Him, yes.

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:39.548
- You know the worst thing?
- What?

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:42.696
- I don't have anything to look forward to now.
- That's not true.

01:18:42.851 --> 01:18:45.388
You have two kinds of stuffing.

01:18:46.021 --> 01:18:48.262
You have real cranberry sauce.

01:18:48.424 --> 01:18:50.870
You have enough turkey there
to feed New Jersey.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.600
- What?
- Oh, my Roz.

01:18:52.761 --> 01:18:53.899
Yeah, yeah.

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:57.340
I'm so sorry I missed our Thanksgiving.
It's our tradition.

01:18:57.499 --> 01:19:00.343
No. We're having it now.

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:16.470
Yeah.

01:22:16.632 --> 01:22:19.476
We were talking about how much
we'll miss you. Right, Robert?

01:22:19.635 --> 01:22:21.581
- Yeah. We were talking about it.
- Bummer.

01:22:21.737 --> 01:22:23.114
- It is a bummer.
- Right?

01:22:23.272 --> 01:22:24.876
- Bummer.
- Yeah.

01:22:25.474 --> 01:22:27.954
Hey, Doris, are you gonna keep
the Schnozz doll?

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:31.315
- Schmear?
- I'm gonna change that name.

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.323
Do you promise to take
good care of him?

01:22:33.482 --> 01:22:36.759
- I'l take such good care of Lance.
- Just take it. Just take it.

01:22:36.919 --> 01:22:38.626
Thank you.

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:42.166
Hey, how about that yoga cats calendar,
Doris? Can I have that?

01:22:42.391 --> 01:22:45.065
- Oh. Yeah. No, take that.
- Thanks so much.

01:22:45.227 --> 01:22:46.831
I've had my eye on it for a minute.

01:22:46.995 --> 01:22:48.406
- Hey.
- They're so flexible.

01:22:48.564 --> 01:22:50.237
It's been a pleasure.

01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:56.513
Look at that.

01:22:56.672 --> 01:23:00.119
That is nice.
Has anyone called dibs on this yet?

01:23:00.843 --> 01:23:02.914
- Oh, take it. Just take it, okay?
- Thank you.

01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:06.685
- Thank you so much, Doris. We'll call.
- Thank you.

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:11.329
- Doris.
- Goodbye, Anne.

01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:13.524
Goodbye? Where do you think
you're going?

01:23:13.689 --> 01:23:16.465
There's plenty of work to be done.
The day has barely begun.

01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:19.299
Anne, I quit. Effective immediately.

01:23:19.461 --> 01:23:21.498
I'm taking all my office supplies.

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:26.503
And... And wait,
one more thing. This ball...

01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:30.282
is not a chair!

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:42.186
Hi.

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:44.792
Hi.

01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:47.125
I wanted to say goodbye.

01:23:50.058 --> 01:23:52.163
- What do you mean?
- I've been here too long...

01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:55.797
and I am just ready...

01:23:55.964 --> 01:23:59.502
to move on.

01:24:00.135 --> 01:24:05.380
And I know I owe you an apology
for Thanksgiving.

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:07.487
John, I...

01:24:07.809 --> 01:24:11.052
I wanna thank you
for your friendship.

01:24:11.213 --> 01:24:13.887
You know? And all the time...

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:18.763
we did spend together.
It was great.

01:24:18.921 --> 01:24:20.662
And, um...

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:23.998
I never meant to hurt anyone.

01:24:26.028 --> 01:24:27.769
So...

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:31.700
you take care of yourself.

01:24:51.353 --> 01:24:52.627
Doris, wait.

01:24:58.393 --> 01:25:00.395
It was more than just a friendship.

01:25:00.562 --> 01:25:05.068
I never should have tried to set you up
with my Uncle Frank. That was stupid.

01:25:05.233 --> 01:25:11.548
Like I can't stop thinking
about what happened at my party...

01:25:11.873 --> 01:25:14.251
and about what you said.

01:25:14.743 --> 01:25:16.723
Look, Doris, I...

01:25:18.213 --> 01:25:21.592
I don't know,
maybe this sounds crazy...

01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:25.958
but why shouldn't we try
to make this work?

01:25:27.823 --> 01:25:29.632
Why can't it? I don't...

01:25:30.225 --> 01:25:32.501
I mean, fuck it, right?

01:25:33.395 --> 01:25:36.137
I guess what I'm trying to ask is...

01:25:37.566 --> 01:25:41.173
do you maybe wanna go
grab a bite to eat...

01:25:41.603 --> 01:25:44.174
- or go see a movie or something?
- Shut up, John.

01:26:13.635 --> 01:26:14.978
Doris, wait.
