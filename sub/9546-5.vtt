00:01.609 --> 00:03.838
Look at that skyline.

00:04.022 --> 00:07.191
It's the second most beautiful
sight in the world.

00:07.191 --> 00:09.300
The most beautiful is you.

00:09.300 --> 00:11.510
Standing in front of me.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.065
Are you okay?

00:16.444 --> 00:20.085
You... you didn't say five words
at dinner.

00:21.203 --> 00:25.878
Jay, remember you said
we couldn't go out on like this.

00:25.878 --> 00:28.062
You said I had to make a decision.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.822
You were right.

00:31.622 --> 00:33.205
I'm going back to Eric.

00:33.205 --> 00:35.468
- I'm going to try and make it work.
- What?

00:35.468 --> 00:38.025
He's my husband, Jay.

00:38.721 --> 00:42.307
I tried to tell you at dinner.
I don't know.

00:42.929 --> 00:45.857
I didn't want to ruin your birthday.

00:50.469 --> 00:53.278
Let's go somewhere.
Just the two of us.

00:53.278 --> 00:55.651
We can go to Bahia Tortolo
for the week.

00:55.651 --> 00:57.339
I can get Dr. Eastman to cover
my patients.

00:57.339 --> 00:59.382
No, Jay, you're not listening.
It's over.

00:59.382 --> 01:00.590
We can leave on Monday.

01:00.590 --> 01:02.304
- The boat's already stocked up.
- What is your problem?

01:02.304 --> 01:06.196
I'm not going anywhere with you
except back to shore.

01:06.738 --> 01:09.057
Whatever you say.

01:09.393 --> 01:10.806
Please.

01:11.195 --> 01:13.740
Just take me home.

01:17.155 --> 01:21.961
I suppose you've told Eric everything.

01:21.961 --> 01:23.313
Are you kidding?

01:23.313 --> 01:26.003
You haven't told anyone?

01:26.003 --> 01:28.309
I'm not exactly proud of this.

01:28.309 --> 01:32.647
So it's like it never happened.

01:32.647 --> 01:34.992
That's one way to look at it.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:46.447 --> 01:48.372
Never happened.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON USA: 2006/08/04

03:14.746 --> 03:16.249
Mr. Monk?

03:18.832 --> 03:20.377
Hello?

03:22.886 --> 03:25.751
- What's going on?
- Making lunch.

03:28.327 --> 03:29.679
And what's wrong with those?

03:29.679 --> 03:31.624
Uh, those are not quite up to snuff.

03:31.624 --> 03:35.408
You know me.
It's got to be snuff.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.360
What's that?

03:39.360 --> 03:41.533
It's a surprise.

03:41.533 --> 03:44.263
Did I ever tell you about my
grandpa, Neville Davenport?

03:44.263 --> 03:46.474
No, is he in the box?

03:46.474 --> 03:49.403
He was a great man.
You remind me of him, actually.

03:49.403 --> 03:51.701
He was an assistant pharmacist
in London.

03:51.701 --> 03:55.008
And then, when he was about you age,
he completely changed his life.

03:55.008 --> 03:55.992
Just like that.

03:55.992 --> 03:59.851
He quit his job and started a
toothpaste company in England.

03:59.851 --> 04:02.983
A toothpaste company in England.
I mean, talk about optimism.

04:02.983 --> 04:06.929
And now, it's the third biggest brand
in the world after Colgate and Crest.

04:06.929 --> 04:08.748
Ah, I love that story.

04:08.748 --> 04:12.662
I guess my favorite part is about
the toothpaste company.

04:12.662 --> 04:14.249
Mr. Monk, there's
a point to this story.

04:14.249 --> 04:16.837
I don't think so.
I've been listening very carefully.

04:16.837 --> 04:21.387
Okay, so I've been thinking
about this. And, uh...

04:22.817 --> 04:24.705
I think you should start your
own company.

04:24.705 --> 04:26.780
Be a private investigator.

04:26.780 --> 04:30.060
I mean, really go for it.
Hire a PR person.

04:30.060 --> 04:33.129
Be aggressive. Advertise.
Get new clients.

04:33.129 --> 04:35.885
Um... / Mr. Monk, there are other
detectives out there

04:35.885 --> 04:38.418
with a fraction of your talent
who are getting rich.

04:38.418 --> 04:39.868
You're Adrian Monk.

04:39.868 --> 04:42.149
People will pay a fortune to hire you.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.686
Yeah, that's something to
think about.

04:44.686 --> 04:49.166
I thought you'd say that, so I did
what Grandpa Neville did, and...

04:49.166 --> 04:51.552
I took the initiative.

04:51.888 --> 04:55.320
A. Monk Private Investigations.

04:55.911 --> 04:58.679
$85?
That's 85 cents a card.

04:58.679 --> 05:01.686
Mr. Monk, that doesn't matter.
You can't be afraid to take risks.

05:01.686 --> 05:03.520
I think I can.

05:03.520 --> 05:06.028
In fact, I think I already am.
Hold on.

05:06.028 --> 05:10.024
Germs, heights, snakes, milk,
needles, risk.

05:10.024 --> 05:11.562
Yeah, it's on there.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.458
Number six.

05:24.458 --> 05:28.381
You know what Grandpa Neville's
favorite expression was?

05:28.742 --> 05:31.847
"Leap and the net will appear."

05:31.847 --> 05:37.815
Well, he sounds like a very
pleasant, very insane person.

05:38.319 --> 05:41.502
It's not even at the right address.

05:41.502 --> 05:42.895
Yes, it is.

05:42.895 --> 05:44.400
No, it isn't.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.518
Shunpike Road.
That's all the way downtown.

05:47.518 --> 05:50.279
- It's the right address.
- It isn't.

05:50.279 --> 05:52.313
Yes, it is.

06:03.890 --> 06:05.610
Can I open my eyes now?

06:05.610 --> 06:08.010
Mr. Monk, your eyes are opened.

06:09.195 --> 06:10.945
When Grandpa Neville first started out,

06:10.945 --> 06:14.296
I swear to you his
office looked just like this.

06:14.296 --> 06:17.600
Okay, so this is my desk.
And yours is in there.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.216
So when the clients come in,
they sit there.

06:20.216 --> 06:23.887
But then they come in here and
talk to me.

06:23.887 --> 06:27.515
And if I think they're legit, then
I send them in to you.

06:27.515 --> 06:29.383
- What clients?
- Oh, they'll be calling.

06:29.383 --> 06:31.792
I took out some ads on the Internet
and in the phone book.

06:31.792 --> 06:35.415
- Uh, Natalie, you can't afford this.
- Actually, you're paying for it.

06:35.415 --> 06:37.674
- I can't afford this.
- Oh, yes, you can.

06:37.674 --> 06:39.324
Remember last month
when you got that bonus

06:39.324 --> 06:41.719
after solving the Kensington case?

06:41.719 --> 06:44.343
No. / That's because I used it for
a down payment.

06:44.343 --> 06:48.016
Grownups have a word for that.
We call it embezzlement.

06:48.016 --> 06:51.336
- Don't tell me... Grandpa Neville.
- That's Grandpa Neville.

06:51.336 --> 06:53.323
Well, it's only fitting that we have
his picture up.

06:53.323 --> 06:55.249
After all, he is our inspiration, right?

06:55.249 --> 06:57.433
Leap and a net will appear.

06:57.669 --> 06:59.936
Okay, I appreciate what you're
trying to do here.

06:59.936 --> 07:01.431
I really do, but, uh...

07:01.431 --> 07:02.744
I have a job.

07:02.744 --> 07:05.697
I am a consultant for
the police department.

07:05.697 --> 07:07.970
Not full time. And, Mr. Monk,
they haven't called in weeks.

07:07.970 --> 07:10.975
Which is fine with me.
I am not an ambitious man.

07:10.975 --> 07:14.463
- I am not Grandpa Neville.
- You just give it a few months.

07:14.463 --> 07:15.587
I'm sorry... Months?

07:15.587 --> 07:17.217
Okay, a few weeks.
You'll see.

07:17.217 --> 07:19.747
It's gonna be great.
Trust me.

07:20.588 --> 07:22.204
You'll see.

07:24.216 --> 07:26.711
How about Hamburg?

07:28.594 --> 07:35.314
I am into yoga, Pilates, getting in
touch with my spirituality...

07:35.562 --> 07:38.055
Been there, married that.

07:39.429 --> 07:43.746
"My hobbies include bike riding,
running, cuddling."

07:43.746 --> 07:45.838
Captain?
You got a second?

07:45.838 --> 07:47.584
Uh, yeah, um...

07:48.065 --> 07:49.814
Hang on, Randy.

07:50.264 --> 07:51.881
Uh, just a minute.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.346
Hang on.

07:54.802 --> 07:56.490
You okay? / Yeah!

07:57.113 --> 07:58.681
Yeah.

07:58.952 --> 08:03.652
This is, um... classified,
need-to-know stuff.

08:03.652 --> 08:05.856
- What's going on?
- Missing schoolteacher.

08:05.856 --> 08:07.348
Husband's looking better and better.

08:07.348 --> 08:09.861
I talked to a neighbor...
trouble in paradise.

08:09.861 --> 08:13.613
Anna Pollard's been talking to a lawyer
four months ago about filing for a separation.

08:13.613 --> 08:17.113
No kidding? He told me that
it was one long honeymoon.

08:17.113 --> 08:19.996
Randy, that man lied to us.
I need to talk to him again.

08:19.996 --> 08:21.230
Yes, sir.

08:21.591 --> 08:26.266
Oh, by the way, my cousin saw
your profile on Make-A-Date.net.

08:26.496 --> 08:29.433
I didn't know you like bossa nova.

08:32.063 --> 08:34.496
Uh, that was, um...

08:35.668 --> 08:40.370
It was... There was an undercover sting
operation going on with the Vice.

08:42.928 --> 08:45.090
Okay, I admit it. I, um...

08:45.090 --> 08:46.881
I signed on.
I was curious.

08:46.881 --> 08:49.224
Tell your cousin that I was just
joking around. / That's okay.

08:49.224 --> 08:53.614
You can tell her yourself.
You've been talking to her all week.

08:53.614 --> 08:56.471
- She's Sexy In Sonoma.
- Wait, that's your cousin?

08:56.471 --> 08:57.819
When did you put in a hot tub?

08:57.819 --> 09:00.162
- I didn't put in a hot tub.
- She said you put in a hot tub.

09:00.162 --> 09:02.634
I had a hot tub
when I was at the motel.

09:02.634 --> 09:04.112
Oh, that must be it.

09:53.990 --> 09:56.901
Adrian Monk Investigations.
What is the nature of your problem?

09:56.901 --> 10:00.298
Being kept in a room
against my will.

10:00.298 --> 10:01.610
You were kidnapped?

10:01.610 --> 10:03.369
Oh, my God.
Hold on, hold on.

10:03.762 --> 10:04.980
Do you know who did it?

10:04.980 --> 10:08.813
Yes, it was my personal assistant.

10:08.813 --> 10:13.239
Her name is Natalie Teeger.

10:13.239 --> 10:15.162
Natalie...

10:15.593 --> 10:17.966
It's been two days.

10:17.966 --> 10:21.013
You're human.
You made a mistake.

10:21.013 --> 10:23.420
- It's not a mistake.
- It's a mistake.

10:23.420 --> 10:27.180
Okay, it took Grandpa Neville's
business a whole year before it took off.

10:27.180 --> 10:28.515
You know...

10:28.515 --> 10:32.680
Not everybody feels the same way
you do about Grandpa Neville.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.508
For example, I was just thinking
how much fun it would be

10:35.508 --> 10:39.830
to dig up his body and poke it
with a big stick.

10:39.830 --> 10:41.391
Who's Grandpa Neville?

10:41.391 --> 10:44.982
And why are we poking him with a stick?

10:47.697 --> 10:49.919
Adrian Monk?
I'm Linda Fusco.

10:49.919 --> 10:51.677
Wait, do I know you?

10:51.677 --> 10:54.937
- Are you an actress?
- Real estate.

10:54.937 --> 10:59.617
Oh, oh, oh, Linda Fusco Realty.
On bus stops and billboards.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.446
Wow, I can't believe Larry finally
rented this dump out.

11:02.446 --> 11:05.321
How much is he getting,
3000 a month?

11:05.540 --> 11:08.358
3200. / Whoa, boy.
He's having you for lunch.

11:08.358 --> 11:09.769
Next time, you come to me.

11:09.769 --> 11:12.514
Adrian, I've been asking around.
Cops, reporters...

11:12.514 --> 11:15.362
And they all say that
you are the man.

11:15.362 --> 11:17.459
Well, I'm a man.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.087
Oh, no, no, no.
He's just being modest.

11:19.087 --> 11:22.298
He is the man.
He is the gold standard.

11:22.298 --> 11:25.287
He is like Philip Marlow and
Sherlock Holmes just rolled into...

11:25.287 --> 11:27.385
Sweetheart, I'm showing a condo
in 20 minutes.

11:27.385 --> 11:30.156
So let's get this going.
Follow me.

11:31.526 --> 11:33.214
Where are we going?

11:33.395 --> 11:34.796
It's right out here.

11:38.499 --> 11:41.148
- This is it.
- That's a nice car.

11:41.148 --> 11:46.175
This is a Lucerne 275 North star V8.

11:46.175 --> 11:49.761
I get a new Buick every year.
It's my trademark.

11:50.325 --> 11:52.166
See?

11:53.919 --> 11:56.034
There's a scratch.

11:56.034 --> 11:57.626
It's a dent.

11:57.626 --> 11:58.870
It's a dent.

11:58.870 --> 12:02.195
Here and here.
Son of a bitch.

12:02.195 --> 12:06.050
And he left this on the windshield.

12:07.629 --> 12:09.806
"Go to Nell."
Who's Nell?

12:09.806 --> 12:12.200
Mr. Monk, I think that's an H.

12:12.200 --> 12:15.427
- So will you take the case?
- What case is that?

12:15.427 --> 12:17.400
This is it.
This is the case.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.964
The dented fender?

12:18.964 --> 12:20.246
Yes.

12:20.246 --> 12:22.473
It happened at the Marina
Wednesday morning.

12:22.473 --> 12:24.257
I have a boat there.

12:24.257 --> 12:26.404
I got there at ten to six
to pick something up,

12:26.404 --> 12:28.372
and then I came back
20 minutes later and...

12:28.372 --> 12:29.545
Mrs. Fusco...

12:29.545 --> 12:31.298
Ms. Fusco. / Miss Fusco.

12:31.298 --> 12:32.748
Ms.

12:32.748 --> 12:36.738
Linda... Linda, you must be insured.

12:36.738 --> 12:39.611
But why should I pay for something
that I didn't do?

12:39.611 --> 12:41.734
I love this car.
This is my baby.

12:41.734 --> 12:44.501
And I want you to find that
son of a bitch, Mr. Adrian Monk,

12:44.501 --> 12:46.306
and make him pay for it.

12:46.306 --> 12:49.058
- Yeah, it's a matter of principle.
- Exactly.

12:49.058 --> 12:52.199
We'll take the case. I'll draw up
the contracts. We get $400 a day.

12:52.199 --> 12:54.600
I'll pay you $3000 if you catch the
son of a bitch.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.069
And if you don't you get zip.

12:56.069 --> 12:58.256
I work on commission.
Why shouldn't you?

12:58.256 --> 13:00.761
Could I talk to you for a second?

13:04.526 --> 13:06.233
- Can we go home now?
- I think we should do it.

13:06.233 --> 13:08.920
Natalie, it's a fender bender.
It's not even a real crime.

13:08.920 --> 13:12.022
It's a crime.
It's a misdemeanor or something.

13:12.022 --> 13:14.146
Mr. Monk, we have to start
somewhere.

13:14.146 --> 13:16.484
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

13:16.484 --> 13:18.519
Well, what's it gonna be?

13:18.519 --> 13:19.907
Are we in business?

13:19.907 --> 13:22.296
Yes, ma'am.
We're on the case.

13:26.587 --> 13:30.553
So according to this snap shots
looks like her Buick was parked over there.

13:30.553 --> 13:33.110
So maybe somebody backed up.

13:33.110 --> 13:34.406
What do you think?

13:34.406 --> 13:38.034
Natalie, what are we doing here?
I'm a homicide detective.

13:38.034 --> 13:40.564
Mr. Monk, I know it's not the crime
of the century,

13:40.564 --> 13:43.993
but someone did this to her,
and Linda Fusco deserves justice too.

13:43.993 --> 13:46.411
Okay, what's next?
Getting cats out of trees?

13:46.411 --> 13:47.964
Chasing jaywalkers?

13:47.964 --> 13:49.526
You know, Grandpa Neville used to
always say...

13:49.526 --> 13:51.547
Grandpa Neville used to say a man's
reputation... / Okay, okay.

13:51.547 --> 13:52.892
Okay, I'll do it.
I'll do it.

13:52.892 --> 13:56.766
I'll do it. Anything but another
Grandpa Neville story.

13:56.766 --> 13:58.364
Thank you.

14:06.222 --> 14:07.731
You're right.

14:09.138 --> 14:13.617
You're right.
He backed out... like this.

14:13.617 --> 14:17.669
He must've gone this way.

14:21.145 --> 14:23.544
He went the wrong way.

14:24.136 --> 14:27.147
Why was he going the wrong way?

14:37.573 --> 14:40.773
Video camera covering the exit.

14:40.773 --> 14:43.880
- He didn't want to be taped.
- Oh, oh, oh!

14:43.880 --> 14:45.375
That's good.
Now we're cooking!

14:45.375 --> 14:46.956
Yeah. Now we're cooking.

14:46.956 --> 14:48.919
So if he didn't want to be taped,

14:48.919 --> 14:52.688
- why would he leave a note?
- Maybe there was a witness.

14:52.688 --> 14:56.408
Somebody saw the accident,
was watching him...

14:56.408 --> 15:01.370
Maybe the perpetrator thought
that if he just drove away,

15:01.370 --> 15:04.161
the witness would report it.

15:04.161 --> 15:07.122
So he got out

15:07.122 --> 15:09.408
- and pretended to leave a note.
- Okay. All right.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.589
So we have to just find that witness.

15:11.589 --> 15:13.713
Ah, where should we start?

15:15.508 --> 15:18.630
We might wanna start with Bill Gibbard.

15:18.913 --> 15:20.877
Bill Gibbard.
That's great. That's great!

15:20.877 --> 15:22.678
Oh, it's exciting!

15:22.678 --> 15:25.296
Oh, yeah.
This is a thrill a minute.

15:25.296 --> 15:27.930
Captain Bill Gibbard
Deep Sea Fishing

15:38.423 --> 15:39.940
Hello, there.
Hi.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.402
We're looking for Mr. Gibbard.

15:41.402 --> 15:43.460
Captain Gibbard,
and you're looking at him.

15:43.460 --> 15:45.388
What's left of him.

15:45.388 --> 15:46.965
But I can't help you today, missy.

15:46.965 --> 15:49.654
Got... bull kelp.

15:49.654 --> 15:54.816
It's fouling my propeller something
terrible every time I go out past
the southeast barrier.

15:54.816 --> 15:58.815
Avoid the southeast barrier.
That's my advice.

15:59.052 --> 16:02.034
Okay. That's some great advice.
Thank you.

16:02.645 --> 16:05.602
- What kind of dog is that?
- He's just a mutt.

16:05.602 --> 16:08.472
Oh, yeah.
How long do they live?

16:08.472 --> 16:10.656
Captain, this is Adrian Monk.

16:10.656 --> 16:12.497
- Monk?
- Yeah, he's a private investigator.

16:12.497 --> 16:14.795
We wanted to talk to you about
a car accident

16:14.795 --> 16:17.782
that happened in that parking lot
on Wednesday morning at 6:00.

16:17.782 --> 16:18.672
I wasn't here.

16:18.672 --> 16:21.855
Your sign says that you're here
at dawn every day.

16:21.855 --> 16:24.586
Well, I guess I must've been.

16:24.586 --> 16:26.285
But I didn't see nothing.

16:26.285 --> 16:27.944
You heard it though, right?

16:27.944 --> 16:30.899
It's only a couple hundred feet away.

16:36.940 --> 16:39.906
Are you calling me a liar, Mr. Monk?

16:39.906 --> 16:41.356
Whoa, what are you doing?

16:41.356 --> 16:43.097
I don't like private investigators.

16:43.097 --> 16:44.913
Neither do I.
It was her idea.

16:44.913 --> 16:47.270
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's jut settle down here.

16:47.270 --> 16:50.547
Captain, if you happen to remember
anything, could you please give us a call?

16:50.547 --> 16:52.348
- Here's our card.
- What are you doing?

16:52.348 --> 16:54.222
- It's 85 cents.
- Let go of the card, Mr. Monk.

16:54.222 --> 16:55.745
Let go of the card!
Let g...

16:55.745 --> 16:57.750
Here you go.
Thank you for your time, Captain.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.030
Let's go.

16:59.030 --> 17:01.012
- You owe me 85 cents.
- Fine. Take it out of my paycheck.

17:01.012 --> 17:03.438
- Don't think I won't.
- How'd you get so cheap? Really?

17:03.438 --> 17:05.032
I work for a living.
All right?

17:05.032 --> 17:06.780
At least, I used to.

17:06.780 --> 17:10.463
Now I just get bull kelp splashed on me.

17:11.121 --> 17:13.007
I really think that's an N.

17:13.007 --> 17:15.089
- It's not an N, Mr. Monk.
- What if it is?

17:15.089 --> 17:21.845
What if there is somebody out there
named Nell who's got all the answers?

17:27.362 --> 17:30.338
What is this red swirl?

17:30.338 --> 17:33.056
I really think that's a brand name
or a logo.

17:33.056 --> 17:35.013
It looks like a J.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.934
Or a T.

17:37.324 --> 17:38.930
- Did you see this?
- What?

17:38.930 --> 17:40.802
- That's wax.
- What...

17:40.802 --> 17:43.214
See? That's a clue.

17:43.214 --> 17:44.799
- Isn't this fun?
- No.

17:44.799 --> 17:46.004
Hello.

17:46.004 --> 17:48.621
I'm looking for Sam Spade.

17:48.621 --> 17:51.207
Nice place.
Looks like a real office.

17:51.207 --> 17:52.913
It is a real office.

17:52.913 --> 17:54.530
I didn't know you had it in you.

17:54.530 --> 17:55.901
How's business?

17:55.901 --> 17:57.068
- It's...
- Good, good, good.

17:57.068 --> 17:59.435
We're building a client base.
One client at a time.

17:59.435 --> 18:00.769
Really?
What are you working on?

18:00.769 --> 18:02.563
We're actually in the middle of
something very big.

18:02.563 --> 18:03.738
Very exciting.
Challenging.

18:03.738 --> 18:05.185
- Homicide?
- Ha... ha.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.110
No, it's more of a property damage thing.

18:07.110 --> 18:09.172
Can't really talk about it.
Confidentiality.

18:09.172 --> 18:11.288
- Is this Mitch?
- No, that's not Mitch.

18:11.288 --> 18:13.369
- Does that look like Mitch?
- I don't know.

18:13.369 --> 18:15.654
That's my grandfather.
That's Neville Davenport.

18:15.654 --> 18:17.088
He's our patron saint.

18:17.088 --> 18:18.386
Was he a detective?

18:18.386 --> 18:19.604
Nah...
No.

18:19.604 --> 18:22.652
He was the famous toothpaste tycoon.

18:22.652 --> 18:23.690
Help me. / What?

18:23.690 --> 18:26.655
Help me!
She's gone mad.

18:26.959 --> 18:29.420
Actually, I was hoping that you might
be able to help us.

18:29.420 --> 18:32.266
We hit a wall on that missing
schoolteacher.

18:32.266 --> 18:33.622
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

18:33.622 --> 18:34.843
We might be missing something.

18:34.843 --> 18:39.243
Her car... We found it in a parking lot at
a shopping mall ten miles from the house.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.160
Was it locked?

18:40.160 --> 18:43.971
Locked, no purse,
no third party prints.

18:43.971 --> 18:45.819
She told her husband that
she was going shopping.

18:45.819 --> 18:48.828
Now, either she lied to him,
or he's lying to us,

18:48.828 --> 18:50.793
or somebody grabbed
her in the parking lot.

18:50.793 --> 18:53.012
- Where was he?
- He says he was at home.

18:53.012 --> 18:55.580
He's now admitting that they were
on the rocks.

18:55.580 --> 18:57.206
But I don't think he's the guy.

18:57.206 --> 18:59.173
- Phone records?
- We're still checking.

18:59.173 --> 19:01.940
- Last seen wearing?
- According to the husband,

19:01.940 --> 19:05.291
a light colored dress, sweater,
and a pair of yellow flip-flops.

19:05.291 --> 19:07.590
I think I'm a little jealous.

19:07.590 --> 19:10.237
Are you seeing other clients behind
my back?

19:10.237 --> 19:12.330
Ms. Fusco, no, no, no.
These aren't clients.

19:12.330 --> 19:13.871
These are former colleagues.

19:13.871 --> 19:15.622
This is Randy Disher, and this is...

19:15.622 --> 19:17.781
Captain Leland Stottlemeyer.

19:17.781 --> 19:20.742
- Linda Fusco.
- I know who you are.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.212
I've seen your billboards.

19:22.212 --> 19:24.665
Actually, we just saw one yesterday.

19:24.665 --> 19:27.234
Captain said that you looked really...

19:27.750 --> 19:29.309
Nothing.

19:29.309 --> 19:31.403
He didn't say anything...

19:31.403 --> 19:34.534
which is strange, because he's
usually pretty talkative.

19:34.534 --> 19:37.363
The sign said that you were the
number one realtor in Northern California.

19:37.363 --> 19:39.270
Tell me something I don't know.

19:39.270 --> 19:42.567
The elephant's the only mammal
that can't jump.

19:42.991 --> 19:44.834
Pardon me?

19:44.834 --> 19:46.534
You said tell you something
you don't know.

19:46.534 --> 19:52.133
And I told you that the only mammal
who can't jump is your elephant.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.667
Ms. Fusco, can we help you?

19:54.667 --> 19:57.915
Yes, I would like to drop this off.

19:58.077 --> 20:00.416
Here is an estimate
from the body shop.

20:00.416 --> 20:03.834
My new bumper's going to cost $900.

20:03.834 --> 20:07.843
And when you find this son of a bitch,
I want you to make him eat this.

20:07.843 --> 20:10.168
Wait a minute.
This is your big case?

20:10.168 --> 20:11.672
A fender bender.

20:11.672 --> 20:13.077
How'd you keep this out of the papers?

20:13.077 --> 20:16.529
It is important to me,
Captain Leland Stottlemeyer.

20:17.498 --> 20:20.930
By the way, sorry about the divorce.

20:20.930 --> 20:23.031
I've been in real estate for 14 years,

20:23.031 --> 20:25.540
and I can smell divorce from
100 yards away.

20:25.540 --> 20:28.812
Who's couch are you sleeping on?

20:28.812 --> 20:30.847
Actually, I'm not sleeping on a couch.

20:30.847 --> 20:32.599
It's a futon.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.644
Thank you, Randy.

20:34.644 --> 20:37.419
Well, when you are ready
for your own apartment,

20:37.419 --> 20:39.950
why don't you give me a call?

20:41.841 --> 20:44.791
- Maybe I will.
- Oh, I know you will.

20:44.791 --> 20:48.758
As a matter of fact, I could show you
a couple of things right now.

20:48.758 --> 20:52.328
As a matter of fact,
I've got a little time right now.

20:52.328 --> 20:56.102
- My car or yours?
- No, I always do the driving.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.637
I'll bet you do.

21:00.856 --> 21:02.391
Let's go.

21:03.527 --> 21:04.995
Randy. / Yes, sir.

21:04.995 --> 21:06.489
Why don't you stay here?

21:06.489 --> 21:09.441
- And?
- And not come with us.

21:10.967 --> 21:13.214
See you back at the station.

21:13.214 --> 21:15.029
Whoo!
That was fast.

21:15.029 --> 21:17.882
Captain Leland Stottlemeyer.

21:17.882 --> 21:19.660
Oh, hey, I've been there.

21:19.660 --> 21:21.357
- Where?
- Joel's. It's good.

21:21.357 --> 21:23.510
It's a bar on Stanton.

21:23.510 --> 21:25.218
I recognize the J.

21:25.218 --> 21:27.688
I told you that was a J.

21:28.945 --> 21:30.859
Is that important?

21:34.247 --> 21:35.422
Hi.

21:36.401 --> 21:38.900
Hi, there.
Welcome to Joel's.

21:38.900 --> 21:40.665
Do you have a reservation?

21:40.665 --> 21:42.851
Actually, we'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

21:42.851 --> 21:46.148
- Do you have a card?
- A card, yes.

21:48.419 --> 21:50.336
- Well, give it to her.
- She can see it.

21:50.336 --> 21:52.730
You can see it, right?

21:56.053 --> 21:57.958
- You're a private eye.
- Yeah, is this...

21:57.958 --> 21:59.394
Is this from here?

21:59.394 --> 22:01.934
Yes, that's one of our doggie bags.

22:01.934 --> 22:03.861
Right, we found some wax on it.

22:03.861 --> 22:06.664
Blue and pink thought it might
be from a candle.

22:06.664 --> 22:09.191
Yeah, was there anybody here
celebrating a birthday here recently?

22:09.191 --> 22:10.362
Maybe Tuesday night?

22:10.362 --> 22:13.261
We're thinking he had a birthday cake and
then brought it home in one of these bags.

22:13.261 --> 22:15.061
Mm-hmm, yeah.
There was this guy.

22:15.061 --> 22:16.705
He was sitting over there.

22:16.705 --> 22:18.408
Can I help you with something, my man?

22:18.408 --> 22:21.659
Oh, yes, uh, this man is a private
investigator. And we would love...

22:21.659 --> 22:23.774
Yeah, I wasn't really
talking to you, honey.

22:23.774 --> 22:25.150
Can I help you with something, my man?

22:25.150 --> 22:26.474
Maybe, maybe.

22:26.474 --> 22:29.160
We're looking for somebody who
was here on Tuesday night.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.677
We don't really talk about
our customers.

22:30.677 --> 22:33.009
People come here, want privacy.

22:33.009 --> 22:34.457
We respect that, so...

22:34.457 --> 22:36.280
You guys should probably just
take a hike.

22:36.280 --> 22:37.884
Here's the thing.

22:37.884 --> 22:41.462
The man I'm looking for may be
responsible for a hit and run.

22:41.462 --> 22:43.765
Good for him.
Now beat it.

22:43.765 --> 22:45.167
Here's the thing...

22:46.704 --> 22:48.697
That's the thing.

22:48.876 --> 22:50.288
Get him out of here.

22:50.902 --> 22:51.805
Oh, Natalie.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.279
Oh, God, Mr. Monk.
Don't try to talk.

22:53.279 --> 22:55.226
For the love of God, I'm begging you.

22:55.226 --> 22:57.033
Let's just go home, please.

22:57.033 --> 22:58.502
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm sorry.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.582
Oh, God, are you okay?
I'm so sorry about Hal.

23:00.582 --> 23:03.156
He can be such a creep.
Listen, listen.

23:03.156 --> 23:05.432
This guy you're looking for, okay,
Jay Bennett.

23:05.432 --> 23:07.577
He's a regular.
I think he's a doctor.

23:07.577 --> 23:08.858
- Thank you.
- Yeah, yeah.

23:08.858 --> 23:09.707
Oh, card. / What?

23:09.707 --> 23:11.861
Can you get the card back?
She gave us a name.

23:11.861 --> 23:12.987
- She doesn't need the card.
- W... wait.

23:12.987 --> 23:16.295
Excuse me, do you still have that
business card?

23:16.295 --> 23:18.253
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, it's a little bent.

23:18.253 --> 23:19.610
Okay, thank you.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.963
Here, Mr. Monk.
Here, here, here.

23:21.963 --> 23:23.533
Here's the card.

23:23.758 --> 23:25.602
There, okay. okay.

23:25.602 --> 23:27.196
Watch your step.

23:38.655 --> 23:40.372
Eggy doesn't like you.

23:40.372 --> 23:43.012
The feeling's mutual.
Let's get this over with.

23:43.012 --> 23:45.624
- You wanna count it?
- It's not enough.

23:45.624 --> 23:47.104
What are you talking about?
We have a deal.

23:47.104 --> 23:50.194
- That was before.
- Before what?

23:50.194 --> 23:54.541
Before a private investigator came
poking around.

23:58.676 --> 24:00.302
Monk?

24:00.496 --> 24:01.986
What'd you tell him?

24:01.986 --> 24:04.317
It's what I didn't tell him.

24:04.721 --> 24:08.163
I didn't tell him that you left here on
Tuesday night with a certain young lady

24:08.163 --> 24:11.167
and that you came back Wednesday
morning, and you were alone.

24:11.167 --> 24:14.222
Now, if I'm gonna be talking to private eyes
or maybe even the cops,

24:14.222 --> 24:16.531
it's gonna be double.

24:20.805 --> 24:22.239
Okay.

24:25.758 --> 24:27.479
I'll double it.

24:27.479 --> 24:31.148
But after that, forget it.
Here's the first half.

24:51.905 --> 24:53.812
Shut up.

25:00.143 --> 25:01.614
Are you sure you're okay?

25:01.614 --> 25:04.339
When I was a detective or a consultant,

25:04.339 --> 25:07.777
I would point to the bad guy,
and the cops would go in.

25:07.777 --> 25:11.649
And they would get shot at, or beat up,
or hit in the stomach.

25:11.649 --> 25:14.248
And it was a wonderful system.
See, everybody was happy.

25:14.248 --> 25:16.965
Okay, Mr. Monk, we can't just
give up now.

25:16.965 --> 25:19.997
Oh, good. There it is.
Dr. J. Bennett

25:19.997 --> 25:21.548
Okay.

25:22.053 --> 25:25.452
Please, please, please,
please, please?

25:35.430 --> 25:37.714
Ah! / What?
What do you think?

25:37.714 --> 25:39.764
It's been repaired recently.

25:39.764 --> 25:42.387
The headlights don't match.
That one's new.

25:42.387 --> 25:44.132
Left one's dirty.

25:44.132 --> 25:45.675
Can I help you?

25:45.675 --> 25:47.298
- Dr. Bennett?
- That's right.

25:47.298 --> 25:48.251
Hi, I'm Natalie Teeger,

25:48.251 --> 25:50.414
and this is my boss.
This is Adrian Monk.

25:50.414 --> 25:54.256
Monk? / Yes, uh...
I'm working for the San Francis...

25:54.256 --> 25:58.437
I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm...
I'm a consultant.

25:58.612 --> 26:00.747
I used to be a...

26:00.747 --> 26:01.993
I don't know what the hell I am.

26:01.993 --> 26:03.733
He's a private investigator, Dr. Bennett.

26:03.733 --> 26:06.582
Were you in the marina
Wednesday morning? / No.

26:06.582 --> 26:09.138
You do keep a boat there, right?

26:09.138 --> 26:11.768
Uh... / All right.
Let's get this over with.

26:11.768 --> 26:15.087
You know what happened on
Wednesday morning and so do we.

26:15.087 --> 26:18.384
- You do?
- Are you gonna deny it?

26:18.581 --> 26:20.495
I, uh...

26:20.801 --> 26:24.876
I don't think I should talk about this.
I think I should call a lawyer.

26:24.876 --> 26:26.078
Oh, no, no, no.

26:26.078 --> 26:28.235
I don't think we need to
drag lawyers into this.

26:28.235 --> 26:29.453
They're just gonna, you know...

26:29.453 --> 26:31.499
Blah, blah, blah.
Make a federal case out of it.

26:31.499 --> 26:34.215
- It was an accident, right?
- That's right.

26:34.215 --> 26:36.767
I mean, these things
happen every day, right?

26:36.767 --> 26:38.522
Uh, well...

26:38.522 --> 26:42.188
- It's not a big deal.
- Not a big deal?

26:42.188 --> 26:44.086
What kind of cop are you?

26:44.086 --> 26:46.963
Come on, you pay a few bucks.
Everybody walks away.

26:46.963 --> 26:49.340
It's like it never happened.

26:49.340 --> 26:51.212
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

26:51.212 --> 26:52.910
- What are you talking about?
- What's he talking about?

26:52.910 --> 26:55.999
We are talking about this.

26:55.999 --> 26:57.331
We have a client.

26:57.331 --> 26:58.850
You hit her Buick.

26:58.850 --> 27:00.770
And you damaged the fender.

27:00.770 --> 27:03.764
- Her fender?
- Yes, it's going to cost her $900.

27:03.764 --> 27:05.817
Plus, I think an apology would be nice.

27:05.817 --> 27:08.151
Yeah, what did you think we were
talking about?

27:08.151 --> 27:11.733
I don't know, but you got the wrong guy.

27:11.733 --> 27:13.071
The wrong guy...

27:13.071 --> 27:14.718
Come on!

27:15.986 --> 27:18.683
It's a new headlight.

27:18.683 --> 27:21.278
You're so smart?
Prove it.

27:21.278 --> 27:23.124
Excuse me.

27:27.102 --> 27:28.637
Hold on.
Wait a minute.

27:28.637 --> 27:31.256
- I don't believe this.
- What?

27:31.256 --> 27:33.744
I'm actually starting to care
about this case.

27:33.744 --> 27:37.450
This stupid $900 fender bender.

27:37.649 --> 27:40.188
How the hell did that happen?

27:41.143 --> 27:42.804
There's brand new carpeting.

27:42.804 --> 27:44.290
There's a washer and
dryer in the basement.

27:44.290 --> 27:47.654
And there is a park right down the
street for your kids.

27:47.654 --> 27:50.719
When they come to visit.

27:51.404 --> 27:53.853
The one that we saw yesterday
was bigger, right?

27:53.853 --> 27:56.872
That's true,
but this one has a better view.

27:58.634 --> 28:00.516
How do you figure?

28:00.516 --> 28:04.357
You see this condo here with the
umbrella on the balcony?

28:04.623 --> 28:07.182
Yeah. / That's me.

28:10.252 --> 28:13.385
You're right.
The view is better.

28:13.385 --> 28:14.496
How much is it?

28:14.496 --> 28:18.239
It's $2250 a month, plus utilities.

28:23.321 --> 28:25.009
I don't know.

28:25.009 --> 28:27.633
Leland, it's been five months.

28:27.633 --> 28:29.796
It's time to do this.

28:29.796 --> 28:31.975
Do you think?

28:32.286 --> 28:35.703
Unfortunately, I speak from experience.

28:35.703 --> 28:38.968
I know you're in pain, but you
can't go around it.

28:38.968 --> 28:40.917
You gotta go through it.

28:40.917 --> 28:43.490
Besides, we'll have
something in common.

28:43.679 --> 28:45.831
Really?
What's that?

28:46.241 --> 28:49.113
I'll have a better view too.

28:52.159 --> 28:54.298
I think there it is.
That's his boat.

28:54.298 --> 28:57.767
All right, so his car wasn't
in the lot, so, uh...

28:57.767 --> 28:59.604
- Let's do it.
- Wait.

28:59.871 --> 29:02.087
Don't.
We don't have a warrant.

29:02.087 --> 29:04.461
We don't need a warrant.
It's a boat.

29:04.461 --> 29:09.031
Well, that's completely false,
but it sounds good.

29:09.504 --> 29:10.986
Let's do it. / Wait.

29:10.986 --> 29:13.338
I can't go.
The boat is on the water.

29:13.338 --> 29:16.374
I don't do water.

29:16.374 --> 29:17.754
You can't swim?

29:17.754 --> 29:20.562
- To be honest, I don't know.
- You don't know.

29:20.562 --> 29:24.721
I mean, I know how to swim...
technically.

29:24.721 --> 29:28.535
I've just never... actually, you know,
done it.

29:28.535 --> 29:30.341
All right, I took a correspondence course.

29:30.341 --> 29:32.464
You learned to swim by mail?

29:32.464 --> 29:34.699
They sent me a little diploma.

29:34.699 --> 29:37.330
And this.

29:38.449 --> 29:41.654
"Swimming Fundamentals.
Don't panic.

29:41.654 --> 29:44.180
Breathe normally.
Keep kicking."

29:44.180 --> 29:45.206
Can I have that back?

29:45.206 --> 29:47.301
Why did you even take the course?
You never go near the water.

29:47.301 --> 29:50.308
- Hello? Tsunamis.
- Mr. Monk. You don't have to worry.

29:50.308 --> 29:52.316
You're not even gonna get wet.
Look, look, look, look.

29:52.316 --> 29:55.348
That boat is tied to the dock.
The dock is bolted down.

29:55.348 --> 29:57.994
It's like part of the land.
I'll stay here.

29:57.994 --> 30:00.912
If Dr. Bennett shows up,
I'll whistle.

30:08.614 --> 30:11.041
Leap, and a net will appear.

30:52.767 --> 30:54.396
Kelp.

31:14.032 --> 31:15.905
Jump. Jump on.

31:24.811 --> 31:25.960
Jump.

31:50.790 --> 31:52.075
Jump.

31:57.510 --> 31:58.994
Go, go.

33:12.755 --> 33:13.820
Hey.

33:15.411 --> 33:16.299
Hey, fella.

33:16.299 --> 33:19.452
Hey, remember me?
What's wrong?

33:19.452 --> 33:21.069
What's wrong?

33:21.725 --> 33:23.071
Oh, my God.

33:23.257 --> 33:24.419
Oh, my God.

33:24.948 --> 33:27.587
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

33:51.750 --> 33:55.732
It says, uh, personal reference.

34:02.440 --> 34:05.076
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

34:07.132 --> 34:08.561
Excuse me.

34:10.964 --> 34:12.005
Stottlemeyer.

34:12.005 --> 34:13.924
Captain, it's me.
It's Natalie.

34:13.924 --> 34:15.800
I'm at the marina.
I'm at Pier 24.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.446
Natalie, I'm a little busy right now.

34:17.446 --> 34:18.938
There's a body.
It's in the water.

34:18.938 --> 34:20.050
I think it's Bill Gibbard.

34:20.050 --> 34:23.130
Mr. Monk and I were just talking
to him yesterday.

34:26.839 --> 34:30.049
Okay, listen, don't touch anything.
I'll call the harbor patrol.

34:30.049 --> 34:32.409
- Be there in a minute.
- Okay. Okay.

34:34.097 --> 34:36.641
No, no, no, no, Mr. Monk!

34:36.812 --> 34:38.483
Mr. Monk!

34:56.902 --> 34:58.875
Stottlemeyer. / Sir.

34:59.115 --> 35:00.640
- How you doing?
- Fine.

35:33.890 --> 35:35.558
Hey, Lieutenant.

35:35.919 --> 35:39.014
- What's going on?
- Oh, you know, a little bit of everything.

35:39.014 --> 35:42.358
A local fisherman drowned.
ME's on his way.

35:42.358 --> 35:43.755
And Monk is stowed away on a boat.

35:43.755 --> 35:45.450
- And the boat took off.
- What?

35:45.450 --> 35:47.778
We were here and
we working on Linda's case.

35:47.778 --> 35:50.745
The fender bender? / Yeah, we
have a suspect... Jay Bennett.

35:50.745 --> 35:53.586
And Mr. Monk snuck on the boat
to look around.

35:53.586 --> 35:55.916
It's all my fault.
I just kept on pushing him.

35:55.916 --> 35:58.836
Jay Bennett.
Dr. Jay Bennett?

35:58.836 --> 36:02.091
That name just came up on the
missing schoolteacher, Anna Pollard.

36:02.091 --> 36:04.303
His name's all over
the phone records, too.

36:04.303 --> 36:06.959
I was just going through them.
Dr. Jay Bennett.

36:09.623 --> 36:11.476
Tuesday night.

36:11.664 --> 36:13.706
Tuesday night, he dumped her
body in the bay.

36:13.706 --> 36:16.240
And then he came back here...

36:16.240 --> 36:19.286
He must've hit your car in the
parking lot while he was leaving.

36:19.286 --> 36:21.335
That's why he didn't leave his
name on the note.

36:21.335 --> 36:23.115
He could not admit that he'd been here.

36:23.115 --> 36:24.280
We need to intercept the boat.

36:24.280 --> 36:25.723
How soon can you
get a cutter out here?

36:25.723 --> 36:27.138
10, maybe 15 minutes.

36:27.138 --> 36:28.508
Damn it.

36:28.712 --> 36:30.407
I have a boat.

36:38.232 --> 36:41.699
This isn't about a dented feder, is it?

36:41.699 --> 36:45.536
You figured that out, huh,
Mr. Private Eye?

36:45.536 --> 36:47.618
Is this where you killed her?

36:48.123 --> 36:49.713
Back up.

36:49.894 --> 36:51.911
Against the railing.

36:53.641 --> 36:55.005
Here's the thing.

36:55.005 --> 36:57.726
I... I don't really think I can swim.

36:57.726 --> 36:59.460
I took a course.

36:59.460 --> 37:03.141
But, I never actually, technically...

37:03.141 --> 37:04.241
It doesn't matter.

37:04.241 --> 37:06.943
You're gonna be dead before you
hit the water.

37:07.402 --> 37:10.317
First, the shoe.

38:19.349 --> 38:21.278
"Don't panic."
Forget that.

38:21.278 --> 38:22.981
"Breath normally.

38:22.981 --> 38:26.225
Flutter kicks. Hand..."

39:27.546 --> 39:28.421
Right.

39:29.430 --> 39:32.131
Bennett's in custody.
Coast Guard just intercepted his boat.

39:32.131 --> 39:34.192
Was Mr. Monk with him?

39:41.276 --> 39:42.995
Hey, there he is!
There's Monk!

39:42.995 --> 39:46.090
- Where?
- 20 degrees to port.

39:46.090 --> 39:49.958
Is he swimming? / What's that
beside him? Is it a life preserver?

39:50.588 --> 39:52.885
Ah, looks like a toilet seat.

39:52.885 --> 39:55.458
Well, if it's floating,
why doesn't he just grab it?

39:55.458 --> 39:58.506
- Oh... too hard to explain.
- Complicated story.

39:58.506 --> 40:01.416
- It's just a weird thing.
- Monk! / Hey!

40:07.905 --> 40:09.135
What?

40:11.945 --> 40:13.545
What did he say?

40:13.545 --> 40:16.227
He said, "Leap and a net will appear,
my ass."

40:16.227 --> 40:18.599
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
Here, here, here.

40:18.599 --> 40:20.138
S... Southeast barrier.

40:20.138 --> 40:21.809
Southeast barrier?
What about it?

40:21.809 --> 40:24.822
Her body...
That's where he dumped her.

40:24.822 --> 40:26.680
- He told you that?
- No.

40:26.680 --> 40:28.578
Kelp.
Bull kelp.

40:28.578 --> 40:30.848
It was on his anchor.

40:30.848 --> 40:34.356
It's still wet... from the b... barrier.

40:34.356 --> 40:37.972
Okay, we'll get some divers out
there straight away.

40:37.972 --> 40:39.167
This is Disher.

40:39.167 --> 40:41.784
We need divers out at the
southeast barrier.

40:41.784 --> 40:44.103
Oh, Mr. Monk.
I'm sorry.

40:44.307 --> 40:46.432
Uh... sorry, sorry.

40:46.432 --> 40:48.501
Sorry about the net thing.

41:02.708 --> 41:04.353
Oh!

41:11.809 --> 41:13.315
Yeah?

41:13.498 --> 41:16.301
It's next to the refrigerator.

41:21.155 --> 41:23.274
The other side.

41:27.952 --> 41:29.641
Thank you.

41:32.007 --> 41:34.217
See you around the neighborhood.

41:34.610 --> 41:36.514
I guess you will.

41:45.355 --> 41:47.476
All right.
