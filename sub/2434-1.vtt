03:01.081 --> 03:04.881
I've got four Lamborghinis
that can't meet smog emission standards.

03:04.952 --> 03:07.079
How many times
you wash out with E.P.A.?

03:07.154 --> 03:10.453
Sir, they're
clearing E.P.A. in a few days.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.924
Three times?
You're on a roll.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.553
Four cars, three times each.
That's zip for twelve.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.189
Are you a mechanic
or a NASA engineer?

03:18.265 --> 03:20.529
I told you I've never
dealt with Lamborghinis...

03:20.601 --> 03:23.764
and yet you assured me that you could
deliver the cars within that time frame.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.350
Don't tell me that,
'cause I'm not even listening.

03:26.417 --> 03:28.442
Sir, I hardly think
that's necessary.

03:28.519 --> 03:30.953
I'll explain that
to my swing loan.

03:31.022 --> 03:33.923
I'm into him for 200,000.
That's thousand, three zeros.

03:33.991 --> 03:37.791
I got my money tied up in these cars.
If I don't get it, I am finished.

03:37.862 --> 03:41.263
- Do you understand that?
- You have to understand our situation.

03:41.332 --> 03:43.960
I got a shark snappin' at my heels.

03:44.035 --> 03:46.526
They could've taken the car
and my business 11 days ago.

03:46.604 --> 03:49.038
I am holding them off
with a whip and a chair.

03:49.106 --> 03:51.574
I understand that.
I know delivery is way overdue.

03:51.642 --> 03:54.770
This fuckin' E.P.A.!
The whole world is chokin' on smog...

03:54.846 --> 03:58.680
and they're gonna correct the situation
by keeping my four cars off the road?

03:58.749 --> 04:01.115
Babbitt Collectibles.

04:01.185 --> 04:03.983
Have you tried cash?
How much do these E.P.A. guys earn?

04:04.055 --> 04:06.023
Charlie, Mr. Wyatt.

04:06.090 --> 04:08.251
- Wyatt?
- Yeah, about the swing Loan.

04:08.326 --> 04:11.853
If he doesn't get the money by 5:30,
he's gonna come and seize all the cars.

04:11.929 --> 04:15.262
- I have to call you back.
- You should talk to Mr. Babbitt.

04:15.333 --> 04:20.168
Tell him you watched me sign the check
on Tuesday, then you put it in the mail.

04:20.238 --> 04:22.365
I need this.
Come on.

04:22.440 --> 04:25.375
I wouldn't do that until
you talk to Mr. Babbitt.

04:25.443 --> 04:27.877
His number?
He's on the road now.

04:27.945 --> 04:30.175
- He wants you to call him immediately.
- Charlie--

04:30.248 --> 04:32.978
Tell him I'm connecting to Barbados,
arriving 1:30 a.m.

04:33.050 --> 04:35.518
- Charlie!
- Lenny, I'm standing right here.

04:35.586 --> 04:38.578
Mr. Bateman wants to back out on his car
and he wants to take Mr. Webb with him.

04:38.656 --> 04:42.456
They want their down payments back.
They found two cars at Valley Motors.

04:42.527 --> 04:45.655
Tell him that that was me on the line,
the cars just passed emissions...

04:45.730 --> 04:47.789
and the E.P.A. paperwork
will be in here momentarily.

04:47.865 --> 04:50.857
- You payin' attention to me?
- Yeah, I'm Listening.

04:50.935 --> 04:54.496
Tell them also that I'm knocking off
five grand on both their deals.

04:54.572 --> 04:57.939
- Do you understand that, Lenny?
- I got it.

04:59.911 --> 05:02.436
Mr. Bateman, that was
Mr. Babbitt on the other Line.

05:02.513 --> 05:05.880
As it happens,
the cars are passing emissions--

05:05.950 --> 05:08.475
What am I saying?
The cars have passed emissions.

05:08.553 --> 05:12.080
We're waiting for the E.P.A. paperwork.
We'll have that momentarily.

05:12.156 --> 05:15.091
And because of your
incredible patience...

05:15.159 --> 05:19.721
we're going to knock off $5,000
on each car.

05:19.797 --> 05:22.391
Well, yes,
you've been most patient.

05:22.466 --> 05:26.402
We really appreciate your patience.
Well, thank you.

05:26.470 --> 05:28.461
Thank you.

05:30.408 --> 05:32.342
Ready for Palm Springs?

05:32.410 --> 05:34.605
You still want to go
with all these problems?

05:34.679 --> 05:37.739
We're seconds away from closing
this deal, clearing 75 grand.

05:37.815 --> 05:40.784
- Not bad for a couple of phone calls.
- No, not bad at all.

05:40.851 --> 05:43.786
- You know where to find us, right?
- Right.

05:43.854 --> 05:45.788
I got it under control.

06:08.713 --> 06:11.079
I don't want to be demanding...

06:11.148 --> 06:16.017
but could you possibly say 10 or
12 words before we get to the hotel?

06:16.087 --> 06:18.612
Consider it foreplay.

06:18.689 --> 06:22.056
Can you include me
in some of your thoughts?

06:23.394 --> 06:26.227
I'm just thinkin'.
Nothing special.

06:26.297 --> 06:30.165
Maybe there's something that
you're thinking about that we can talk.

06:30.234 --> 06:33.032
If there was, Susanna,
we'd be talkin' about it.

06:33.104 --> 06:35.368
What's the big to-do
about me thinkin'?

06:35.439 --> 06:40.342
I just feel like I'm going away for
a few days with someone. Call me crazy.

06:40.411 --> 06:43.676
You wanna talk? Let's talk.
How was your day?

06:43.748 --> 06:48.344
I feel you're excluding me from what's
going on. It's not that I wanna talk.

06:48.419 --> 06:51.650
One of these again, Susanna.
How did we get back to one of these?

06:51.722 --> 06:54.987
I don't want to-- I don't know
why I put up with all of this.

06:55.059 --> 06:58.051
You wanted to go to Palm Springs,
and we're goin'.

06:58.129 --> 07:01.223
But I didn't wanna go alone.
I've been sitting in this car for--

07:01.298 --> 07:04.096
You wanna talk?
Let's talk!

07:04.168 --> 07:07.467
This is not talking.

07:07.538 --> 07:10.473
- Yeah?
- Charlie, this is Lenny.

07:10.541 --> 07:13.237
I've been trying to contact you
for a while.

07:13.310 --> 07:17.007
I got a long-distance call from
Mr. Mooney, your father's lawyer.

07:17.081 --> 07:19.811
He's been trying to reach you.

07:19.884 --> 07:22.375
Your father has died, Charlie.

07:24.455 --> 07:28.789
I'm sorry. The funeral's tomorrow
in Cincinnati. He said you'd know where.

07:28.859 --> 07:31.851
- I've got his number.
- That's not necessary.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.988
Anything else?

07:34.065 --> 07:37.262
- If there's anything I can do--
- All right.

07:39.804 --> 07:43.672
- I'm sorry about the weekend, hon.
- Charlie, the weekend?

07:43.741 --> 07:47.575
I told you before,
we had a falling-out a Long time ago.

07:47.645 --> 07:50.705
My mother died when I was two.
It was just him and me.

07:50.781 --> 07:54.046
We just didn't get along.

07:54.118 --> 07:56.484
- You're going to the funeral, no?
- Yeah.

07:56.554 --> 08:01.218
- I'm coming with you.
- That's sweet, but there's no point.

08:01.292 --> 08:02.850
I want to.

08:02.927 --> 08:06.658
All right. Sorry.
I forgot who I was talkin' to.

08:23.147 --> 08:24.341
...to our beloved neighbor...

08:24.415 --> 08:29.216
for our memory, admiration
and respect for him...

08:29.286 --> 08:32.744
will live beyond the years
of his life on Earth.

08:32.823 --> 08:37.624
Let us consecrate ourselves to follow
his example of zest for Life...

08:37.695 --> 08:40.163
dedication to family...

08:40.231 --> 08:43.325
and charity to all.

08:43.400 --> 08:47.200
And now, with sure and certain hope
of resurrection Life...

08:47.271 --> 08:51.640
we commend to you
the soul of our departed friend.

09:01.418 --> 09:05.377
Just have to go over the details of
the will with him, and then we leave.

09:05.456 --> 09:07.117
I can wait in the car.

09:43.866 --> 09:47.666
Somebody should be watering those roses.
They're all dying.

09:47.736 --> 09:51.672
Knew this car my whole Life.
Only drove it once.

09:51.740 --> 09:56.177
A 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible.
Only 8,000 production models made.

09:56.245 --> 09:58.713
Straight-Eight.
Fireball Eight.

09:58.781 --> 10:03.218
It was the first full year
of the Dynaflow transmission.

10:03.285 --> 10:05.753
Know it by rote.

10:20.803 --> 10:23.271
You were his only child.

10:23.339 --> 10:25.773
You came along when he was...

10:25.841 --> 10:28.503
what, 45 or something?

10:28.577 --> 10:31.375
He probably thought
he was never going to have a son...

10:31.447 --> 10:33.745
so he had to love you.

10:33.816 --> 10:37.718
I think you're exaggerating.
You were his child, his son, his blood.

10:37.786 --> 10:41.654
In these pictures here, he doesn't look
Like a man who doesn't love his son.

10:41.724 --> 10:45.057
What are you doin' lookin' at this?
Put that away.

10:45.127 --> 10:47.220
- You want to hear a story?
- Don't get mad.

10:47.296 --> 10:50.959
You know the convertible in the garage?
His baby, that and the goddamn roses.

10:51.033 --> 10:54.161
- The Buick.
- The car was off-limits to me.

10:54.236 --> 10:57.330
'That's a classic,' he'd say.
'It's not for children.'

10:57.406 --> 10:59.704
Tenth grade, I'm 16 years old,
and for once...

10:59.775 --> 11:02.471
I bring home a report card,
and it's almost all A's.

11:02.544 --> 11:05.138
I go to my old man,
'Can I take the car out?'

11:05.214 --> 11:08.706
Take the guys out in the Buick,
sort of a victory drive.

11:08.784 --> 11:12.743
He says, 'No.'
I steal the keys, I sneak it out.

11:12.821 --> 11:16.723
You took the car with no permission?
Why? Why then?

11:16.792 --> 11:19.488
Because l--
I deserved it.

11:19.561 --> 11:22.928
Nothing I did was good enough for
this guy. Don't you understand that?

11:22.998 --> 11:25.762
We're on Columbia Parkway,
four kids.

11:25.834 --> 11:28.268
- We get pulled over.
- An accident?

11:28.337 --> 11:30.771
Pulled over.

11:30.839 --> 11:34.570
- What is pulled over? Police?
- Yes, police.

11:34.643 --> 11:38.135
Can I finish?
He called in a report of a stolen car.

11:38.213 --> 11:42.274
Not 'his son took the car
without permission.' Just 'stolen.'

11:42.351 --> 11:44.945
Central Station. The other guys' dads
bail 'em out in an hour.

11:45.020 --> 11:48.046
- He left me there two days.
- He left you in prison two days?

11:48.123 --> 11:50.557
Two days.

11:50.626 --> 11:53.459
Were you scared?

11:53.529 --> 11:55.997
Yeah, I was scared.

11:57.166 --> 11:59.100
Left home.
I never saw him again.

11:59.168 --> 12:01.864
Charlie, after a year
we've been together...

12:01.937 --> 12:04.371
this is the first time
I've heard this story.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.135
It's strange, huh?

12:06.208 --> 12:10.144
I mean, how can you keep all this
inside you and not say anything?

12:10.212 --> 12:15.047
When I was a kid and I got scared,
the Rain Man would come and sing to me.

12:16.185 --> 12:18.517
The rain what?

12:18.587 --> 12:22.250
You know, one of those
imaginary childhood friends.

12:22.324 --> 12:25.760
- What happened to him?
- Nothin'. I just grew up.

12:27.796 --> 12:29.889
Not so much.

12:30.032 --> 12:32.933
'And I remember, too,
the day you left home...

12:33.002 --> 12:35.869
so full of bitterness
and grandiose ideas.

12:35.938 --> 12:37.997
So full of yourself.

12:38.073 --> 12:40.541
And being raised without a mother,
the hardness of your heart...

12:40.609 --> 12:42.736
is understandable as well.

12:42.811 --> 12:46.770
Your refusal to even pretend
that you loved or respected me...

12:46.849 --> 12:48.476
all these I forgive.

12:48.550 --> 12:51.781
But your failure to write, to telephone,
to reenter my Life in any way...

12:51.854 --> 12:54.584
has left me without a son.

12:54.656 --> 12:58.615
I wish you all I ever wanted for you.
I wish you the best.'

13:04.366 --> 13:07.699
'l hereby bequeath to my son,
Charles Sanford Babbitt...

13:07.770 --> 13:09.704
that certain Buick convertible...

13:09.772 --> 13:14.607
the very car that, unfortunately,
brought our relationship to an end.

13:14.676 --> 13:18.806
Also, outright title to my
prizewinning hybrid rose bushes.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.815
May they remind him
of the value of excellence...

13:20.883 --> 13:23.317
and the possibility of perfection.

13:23.385 --> 13:26.218
As for my home and all other property,
real and personal...

13:26.288 --> 13:29.451
these shall be placed in trust
in accordance with the terms of...

13:29.525 --> 13:32.688
that certain instrument
executed concurrently herewith.'

13:32.761 --> 13:34.456
What does that mean?

13:34.530 --> 13:38.125
It means that the estate,
in excess of $3 million...

13:38.200 --> 13:42.864
after expenses and taxes,
will go into a trust fund...

13:42.938 --> 13:45.498
for a beneficiary
to be named in this document.

13:45.574 --> 13:48.543
- Who is that?
- I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

13:48.610 --> 13:52.011
- Who controls the money? You?
- No. He's called a trustee.

13:52.081 --> 13:55.244
What is that?
How does that work?

13:55.317 --> 13:58.184
Forgive me,
but there's nothing more I can say.

13:58.253 --> 14:01.154
I'm sorry, son.
I can see that you're disappointed.

14:01.223 --> 14:04.158
Why should I be disappointed?
I got rose bushes, didn't l?

14:04.226 --> 14:06.387
What's his name got--

14:06.462 --> 14:08.487
- What'd you call him? The--
- Beneficiary.

14:08.564 --> 14:11.431
He got $3 million,
but he didn't get the rose bushes.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.491
I definitely got
the rose bushes.

14:13.569 --> 14:16.265
- Charles.
- I mean, those are rose bushes.

14:16.338 --> 14:19.136
- There's no need--
- To what?

14:19.208 --> 14:21.403
To be upset?

14:21.477 --> 14:23.843
To be upset?

14:23.912 --> 14:26.574
If there is a hell, sir,
my father's in it...

14:26.648 --> 14:30.914
and he is looking up right now
and he is laughing his ass off.

14:30.986 --> 14:33.750
Sanford Babbitt. You wanna be
that guy's son for five minutes?

14:33.822 --> 14:37.189
- Were you Listening to that letter?
- Yes, sir, I was.

14:37.259 --> 14:39.523
Were you?

14:39.595 --> 14:43.622
No. Could you repeat it?
'Cause I can't believe my fuckin' ears.

14:47.469 --> 14:50.097
I was looking for you.

14:50.172 --> 14:52.106
How did it go?

14:53.208 --> 14:55.642
I got what I expected.

15:09.758 --> 15:13.387
Susanna, this could take
a few minutes.

15:30.579 --> 15:33.309
- Can I help you?
- I think you can.

15:33.382 --> 15:37.819
I have a problem with a private trust
and-- That's a terrific suit.

15:37.886 --> 15:40.081
- Thank you.
- My father was Sanford Babbitt.

15:50.332 --> 15:52.266
Is this Wallbrook?

15:52.334 --> 15:54.268
Excuse me.
Is this Wallbrook?

15:54.336 --> 15:56.429
Excuse me.

16:03.779 --> 16:05.440
Dr. Bruner is still in conference.

16:05.514 --> 16:07.448
Would you Like
to wait in his office?

16:07.516 --> 16:09.950
No, we'll stay here.
Thank you.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.300
Maybe we're not supposed
to be looking around here.

16:43.485 --> 16:47.285
Good to have you here.
Good luck to all three of you.

16:47.356 --> 16:49.984
Twenty dollars starts you all
on an important match.

16:50.058 --> 16:54.927
In what 1980 comedy film did Goldie Hawn
get away from it all? Lisa?

16:54.997 --> 16:57.261
- 'Private Benjamin.'
- Excuse me, please.

16:57.332 --> 16:59.823
I'd Like to watch
the TV, please.

16:59.901 --> 17:03.894
For whose grandson was the
presidential retreat Camp David named?

17:03.972 --> 17:05.734
- Lisa?
- Eisenhower.

17:05.807 --> 17:08.207
Right, for David Eisenhower.
You've got another five.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.211
Ten-dollar lead for Lisa.

17:10.279 --> 17:13.942
In days of yore, what would
a swashbuckler keep in his sheath?

17:39.741 --> 17:43.074
Whatever this is, I don't understand
the point of secrecy.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.579
This patient is an old
girlfriend of my father's?

17:45.647 --> 17:48.081
I knew your father
since you were two years old.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.811
The year my mother died.

17:49.885 --> 17:53.116
I'm trustee of the fund, but this
hospital receives nothing from that.

17:53.188 --> 17:55.782
Maybe that's something
we could discuss.

17:55.857 --> 18:00.123
I took on this burden out of loyalty
to your father. My loyalty ends there.

18:00.195 --> 18:02.288
And you think
I should feel that loyalty?

18:02.364 --> 18:05.595
I think you feel cheated
out of your birthright...

18:05.667 --> 18:08.158
by a man who had
difficulty showing love.

18:08.236 --> 18:11.501
And I think if I were in your shoes,
I'd probably feel the same.

18:11.573 --> 18:14.440
I was hoping that we could talk, that
you would explain my father's side...

18:14.509 --> 18:16.443
help me understand
the right in what he's done.

18:16.511 --> 18:19.605
Because, failing that,
I have responsibilities of my own...

18:19.681 --> 18:22.445
and they have to be met,
even if that means a fight.

18:22.551 --> 18:25.019
I'm sorry,
this is not your car.

18:25.087 --> 18:27.578
Yeah, my dad lets me
drive slow on the driveway.

18:27.656 --> 18:30.557
- I'm an excellent driver.
- Are you sure that you drive this car?

18:30.625 --> 18:34.561
There's only 28 miles on the odometer
since I drove it a week ago Saturday.

18:34.629 --> 18:38.087
- Should be more than 28 miles.
- Look, my boyfriend is coming.

18:38.166 --> 18:39.758
Of course, today's Monday.

18:39.835 --> 18:42.770
I always drive the car on Saturday.
Never drive on a Monday.

18:42.838 --> 18:45.466
- Who is this guy?
- He jumped into the car.

18:45.540 --> 18:47.974
- Well, he can jump out.
- I'm an excellent driver.

18:48.043 --> 18:51.877
Yeah, that's good. Come on.
I don't have time for this shit.

18:51.947 --> 18:54.643
Why'd you let him get in?
This is not a toy.

18:54.716 --> 18:58.174
- He says he drives this car.
- Dad lets me drive every Saturday.

18:58.253 --> 19:00.551
Of course, the seats were
originally brown leather.

19:00.622 --> 19:03.090
Now they're pitiful red.

19:03.158 --> 19:05.592
You know, these seats
were brown leather.

19:06.795 --> 19:09.389
- You know this car?
- I know this car.

19:12.367 --> 19:14.426
- How do you know this car?
- I definitely know this car.

19:14.503 --> 19:17.666
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster.
Straight-Eight. Fireball Eight.

19:17.739 --> 19:20.207
Only 8,095 production models.

19:20.275 --> 19:22.800
Dad lets me drive on the driveway,
but not on Monday.

19:22.878 --> 19:24.812
- Definitely not on Monday.
- Who's your dad?

19:24.880 --> 19:27.314
- Sanford Babbitt.
- Who? Sanford Babbitt?

19:27.382 --> 19:30.977
10961 Beechcrest Street,
Cincinnati, Ohio.

19:31.052 --> 19:34.146
That's my address.
What is it with this guy? Hey!

19:34.222 --> 19:36.213
- Who's your mother?
- Eleanor Babbitt.

19:36.291 --> 19:39.749
- Eleanor?
- Died January 5th, 1965.

19:39.828 --> 19:43.491
Who the hell are you?
Wait a second. Where are you goin'?

19:43.565 --> 19:46.125
Thirteen minutes to Judge Wapner
and 'The People's Court.'

19:46.201 --> 19:48.260
I wanna ask you a question.

19:48.336 --> 19:50.942
What you are witnessing is real.
The participants are not actors--

19:51.009 --> 19:53.876
- I'm talkin' to you!
- They're actual litigants.

19:53.945 --> 19:56.175
Bruner, who is this guy?

19:56.248 --> 19:58.512
Raymond is your brother.

20:01.086 --> 20:03.418
My brother?
I don't have a brother.

20:03.488 --> 20:06.150
...and have your disputes
settled here in our forum:

20:06.224 --> 20:09.125
'The People's Court.'

20:09.194 --> 20:11.685
'The People's Court.'

20:15.100 --> 20:17.898
'The People's Court.'

20:19.404 --> 20:23.204
Hello, I'm Doug Llewelyn,
and welcome to 'The People's Court.'

20:23.275 --> 20:25.209
- What is he, crazy?
- No.

20:25.277 --> 20:26.744
- Is he retarded?
- Not exactly.

20:26.812 --> 20:30.043
- Not crazy or retarded, but he's here.
- He's an autistic savant.

20:30.115 --> 20:32.049
I don't know what that means.

20:32.117 --> 20:34.608
People Like him used to
be called 'idiot savants.'

20:34.686 --> 20:37.553
They have certain deficiencies,
certain abilities.

20:37.622 --> 20:39.817
- Well, he's retarded.
- Autistic.

20:39.891 --> 20:43.418
- Actually, high-functioning.
- What does that mean?

20:43.495 --> 20:46.726
It means that there's a disability
that impairs the sensory input...

20:46.798 --> 20:48.789
and how it's processed.

20:48.867 --> 20:51.301
English here.
You're talkin' over my head.

20:51.369 --> 20:53.667
Raymond has a problem
communicating and learning.

20:53.738 --> 20:56.673
He can't even express himself
or probably even...

20:56.741 --> 20:59.005
understand his own emotions
in a traditional way.

21:01.313 --> 21:05.909
And after that, the dog bit him.
I yelled at my dog.

21:05.984 --> 21:08.509
There are dangers
everywhere for Raymond.

21:08.587 --> 21:11.522
Routines, rituals--
It's all he has to protect himself.

21:11.590 --> 21:13.990
Rituals. That's a good one.

21:14.059 --> 21:16.823
Well, it's the way he acts...

21:16.895 --> 21:20.831
sleeps, eats, uses the bathroom,
walks, talks, everything.

21:20.899 --> 21:24.892
- Breaking a routine is terrifying.
- How Long has he been here?

21:24.970 --> 21:28.337
- I came here in 1960.
- How old is he?

21:28.406 --> 21:31.000
He was 18 or 20 then.
I have to check the records.

21:31.076 --> 21:33.772
- You've been here that Long?
- That's when I started.

21:33.845 --> 21:37.576
So that's '65, '75, '85--
I was almost three years old.

21:37.649 --> 21:40.641
You knew he had a brother.
You knew I was his brother.

21:40.719 --> 21:44.553
- Yes, but what's the point?
- What's the fuckin' point?

21:44.623 --> 21:48.024
- Why wasn't I told I had a brother?
- What would you have done about it?

21:50.128 --> 21:52.255
I don't know.

21:53.999 --> 21:56.593
Does he know how much money
he's been left?

21:56.668 --> 21:58.829
No. He doesn't understand
the concept of money.

22:00.972 --> 22:03.668
He doesn't understand
the concept of money.

22:03.742 --> 22:06.006
He's just inherited $3 million...

22:06.077 --> 22:08.910
and he doesn't understand
the concept of money?

22:08.980 --> 22:13.246
Well, that is fuckin' poetic,
don't you think?

22:15.387 --> 22:17.446
Good ol' Dad.

22:17.589 --> 22:20.558
What's his name? Yes.
Then who's playing first? Yes.

22:20.625 --> 22:23.856
Who? The fellow playing
first base for St. Louie. Who?

22:23.929 --> 22:25.920
Why is he doin' that?

22:25.997 --> 22:29.023
Whenever he gets nervous,
he does 'Who's On First?'

22:29.100 --> 22:31.034
- Yeah, why?
- Why?

22:31.102 --> 22:33.935
It's his way of dealing with you
touching his books and stuff.

22:34.005 --> 22:38.499
- So he memorized 'Who's On First?'
- That, among other things.

22:38.577 --> 22:41.011
- Ted Kloszevski.
- Kluszewski.

22:41.079 --> 22:43.707
Ted Kluszewski. 'Big Klu.'
First base.

22:43.782 --> 22:46.376
- He played for Cincinnati.
- Traded for Dee Fondee, 1957.

22:46.451 --> 22:50.547
- Lifetime batting average, .298.
- He reads all these great books, huh?

22:50.622 --> 22:53.523
Reads and remembers
whatever he gets his hands on.

22:55.894 --> 22:59.921
Vern. V-E-R-N. Of course, these people
are gonna be here all day, Vern.

22:59.998 --> 23:02.398
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

23:02.467 --> 23:06.233
-This is definitely not a weekend visit.
-He's gettin' anxious.

23:06.304 --> 23:09.467
- It's okay, Ray.
- Vern.

23:09.541 --> 23:12.374
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

23:12.444 --> 23:15.072
- He said not to touch the books!
- Not to touch books.

23:15.146 --> 23:17.341
- You Like Shakespeare?
- I don't know.

23:17.415 --> 23:19.713
- Did you read all this?
- I don't know. Vern?

23:19.784 --> 23:22.184
- Did you read 'MacBeth'?
- I don't know.

23:22.254 --> 23:24.245
- Vern?
- 'The Twelfth Night'?

23:24.322 --> 23:26.552
- Stop it!
- Yes.

23:26.625 --> 23:31.358
You read all the stories in this book,
and you don't know if you read the book?

23:31.429 --> 23:33.454
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

23:33.531 --> 23:34.657
Maybe you'd better put it back.

23:36.568 --> 23:40.698
You don't know.
Okay, Ray, take it easy.

23:40.772 --> 23:43.036
I won't touch anything else, Ray.

23:43.108 --> 23:46.202
It's okay, Ray.
Come on. My main man.

23:46.278 --> 23:49.577
Vern, my main man.
My main man Vern.

23:49.648 --> 23:52.048
It's okay, Ray.

23:52.117 --> 23:54.108
- My main man.
- My main man.

23:54.185 --> 23:59.316
Here are your cards. I didn't know
where you wanted me to put them.

23:59.391 --> 24:03.225
Are you taking any
prescription medication?

24:05.830 --> 24:08.264
That's his way of showing he likes you.

24:08.333 --> 24:11.166
But when I touched him before,
he pulled away.

24:11.236 --> 24:14.399
Don't take it personal.
He never touched me.

24:14.472 --> 24:19.000
I'm closer to him than anybody.
Known him for nine years. It's not him.

24:19.077 --> 24:23.480
If I left town tomorrow and
didn't say good-bye, he'd never notice.

24:23.548 --> 24:25.482
He wouldn't notice?

24:25.550 --> 24:29.316
I'm not sure, but I don't think
people are his first priority.

24:29.387 --> 24:32.220
Ray, you wanna go take a walk?

24:36.227 --> 24:39.321
Can he hear us
when he's Like that?

24:39.397 --> 24:41.627
You wanna show
your brother your ducks?

24:41.700 --> 24:44.100
There's 27 minutes
to 'Jeopardy.'

24:44.169 --> 24:46.797
Don't worry.
We'll bring you right back.

24:46.871 --> 24:49.635
Practically 26 minutes
to 'Jeopardy.'

24:49.708 --> 24:52.677
- We'll bring him right back.
- Twenty-six minutes.

24:52.744 --> 24:55.076
I won't do it.

24:55.146 --> 25:00.049
First of all because of your
tone of voice, this commanding--

25:00.118 --> 25:04.612
You're upset. Raymond,
I'm gonna talk to Susanna alone.

25:04.689 --> 25:08.455
Susanna, just hold on.
Okay? I'll be right back.

25:08.526 --> 25:11.723
No. Just stay there.

25:14.332 --> 25:19.065
Just stay there.
Just stand still, okay? That's good.

25:19.137 --> 25:22.971
I'll do it if you tell me why.
Why do I do--

25:23.942 --> 25:24.874
What?

25:24.943 --> 25:27.673
Why do I have to take the car
and go down there...

25:27.746 --> 25:31.079
and wait for you again
at the gate?

25:31.149 --> 25:33.481
- Why?
- It's for Raymond.

25:33.551 --> 25:35.485
The car disturbs him.

25:36.588 --> 25:38.681
- That's why?
- That's why.

25:39.624 --> 25:41.057
Okay, Raymond.

25:51.703 --> 25:54.501
What are you lookin' at?
The ducks are over here.

25:54.572 --> 25:56.335
I don't know.

25:59.944 --> 26:02.970
Listen, our father died last week.

26:03.047 --> 26:05.038
- Did they tell you?
- I don't know.

26:05.116 --> 26:08.813
You don't know if they told you,
or you don't know what dead is?

26:09.988 --> 26:12.957
That means he's gone.
He's at the cemetery.

26:13.024 --> 26:16.391
- You wanna go see him at the cemetery?
- I don't know.

26:16.461 --> 26:19.828
- Does that mean maybe you wanna go?
- I don't know.

26:23.168 --> 26:27.628
I thought maybe we could go to
Los Angeles and see a Dodgers game.

26:27.705 --> 26:32.039
- Go see the Dodgers play.
- Today's an off day.

26:32.110 --> 26:34.601
- We don't have to go today.
- Monday, no games scheduled.

26:34.679 --> 26:39.082
I just thought maybe you'd Like
to go see Fernando Valenzuela pitch.

26:39.150 --> 26:42.244
He pitched Saturday.
Not scheduled to pitch 'til Wednesday.

26:42.320 --> 26:44.754
- He's gonna pitch Wednesday?
- Wednesday.

26:44.823 --> 26:47.291
- I'm not doin' anything on Wednesday.
- Yeah, Wednesday.

26:47.358 --> 26:50.088
- Let's go to L.A.
- Yeah.

26:50.161 --> 26:52.322
Come on, Ray.

26:53.531 --> 26:55.795
It's a Long way
to California...

26:55.867 --> 26:59.598
and I'm definitely not supposed to be
off the grounds for more than two hours.

26:59.671 --> 27:02.196
Have to be back in two hours.

27:02.273 --> 27:06.073
The people, crowds cheering.
You'll love it.

28:45.977 --> 28:49.140
- This is the presidential suite.
- Dinner's at 6:30 p.m.

28:49.213 --> 28:50.680
Here is Raymond's room.

28:50.748 --> 28:54.582
- Look at this beautiful room.
- This is definitely not my room.

28:54.652 --> 28:57.587
- It's just for tonight.
- Have to go to Wallbrook for dinner.

28:57.655 --> 29:00.818
Little guy! This is gonna be terrific.
We're brothers.

29:00.892 --> 29:04.919
- Dr. Bruner wants us to have fun.
- When did he say--

29:04.996 --> 29:08.762
I don't have my tapioca pudding.
We have that for dessert.

29:08.833 --> 29:11.427
We can do that.
I'm gonna call Lenny.

29:11.502 --> 29:14.335
This is definitely not my room,
and I don't have my tapioca pudding.

29:14.405 --> 29:17.636
- The bed's in the wrong place.
- You can move it.

29:17.709 --> 29:21.110
- Where do you want the bed?
- Should be near the window.

29:21.179 --> 29:25.172
Of course, I don't have my books.
Of course, there's no bookshelves.

29:25.249 --> 29:28.275
I'm definitely out of books.
I'm gonna be book-less.

29:28.353 --> 29:32.255
Here's a book, a big telephone book.
A lot of words.

29:32.323 --> 29:34.291
Pick up, Lenny.

29:34.359 --> 29:38.796
I got $200,000 going to the shithouse,
and he doesn't answer the phone.

29:38.863 --> 29:41.661
- 6:00 here means it's 9:00 there.
- It's 3:00 there.

29:41.733 --> 29:42.995
6:30 p.m. is dinner.

29:43.067 --> 29:46.002
It's 3:00 there.
He doesn't wanna answer the phone?

29:46.070 --> 29:48.004
Orange soda.

29:49.073 --> 29:51.132
Has to be in a can with a straw.

29:51.209 --> 29:54.576
Bruner told you
that you should do this?

29:54.646 --> 29:57.080
- It doesn't make sense.
- I know what's good for him.

30:18.002 --> 30:19.492
V-E-R-N!

30:19.570 --> 30:23.006
Oh, God.
Go see what he's doin'.

30:23.908 --> 30:26.604
- Ray?
- V-E-R-N!

30:26.678 --> 30:28.942
- What is it?
- What's happening, homes?

30:29.013 --> 30:32.278
Everything is fine.
Charlie, let's take him home.

30:32.350 --> 30:35.444
He's okay.
Just get him some dinner.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.511
Did you say you wanted hamburger?

30:37.588 --> 30:39.647
Hamburger, Ray?

30:39.724 --> 30:43.353
- We have pepperoni pizza Monday nights.
- Pizza?

30:43.428 --> 30:47.159
- You get pizza in the institution?
- Monday night's Italian night.

30:47.231 --> 30:50.598
- Law offices of Mitchell and Mitchell.
- Get me Stu.

30:50.668 --> 30:55.071
- I'm sorry, he's not here.
- I've got a bit of a legal problem.

30:55.139 --> 30:57.835
He's out of town
until tomorrow afternoon.

30:57.909 --> 31:00.275
All right,
I'll call him tomorrow.

31:04.949 --> 31:09.318
- Definitely not.
- We can watch TV here. We're allowed.

31:11.923 --> 31:14.756
'Wheel of Fortune'!

31:14.826 --> 31:18.785
Look at this studio filled with
glamorous merchandise...

31:18.863 --> 31:21.331
fabulous and exciting
bonus prizes.

31:21.399 --> 31:25.836
A pair of cars for today's busy couple.

31:25.903 --> 31:28.929
Thousands of dollars in cash.

31:29.006 --> 31:34.410
Over $150,000
just waiting to be won...

31:34.479 --> 31:38.006
as we present
our big bonanza of cash...

31:38.082 --> 31:41.916
on 'Wheel Of Fortune'!

31:41.986 --> 31:46.355
I'd Like to order a large pizza.
Pepperoni, right?

31:46.424 --> 31:47.789
I don't want pepperoni.

31:47.859 --> 31:51.955
Yeah, a large pepperoni.
How Long is that gonna take?

31:52.029 --> 31:55.863
Bring some beer up and orange soda.
You got tapioca pudding?

31:55.933 --> 31:59.198
- No, sir, we don't.
- Just bring the closest thing.

32:00.805 --> 32:04.639
Ray, take this.
Food is coming shortly.

32:04.709 --> 32:06.700
I'll be right back.

32:09.380 --> 32:13.976
Of course, I'm gonna be here
for a Long time, a very Long time.

32:14.051 --> 32:17.344
I'm gone for good,
gone for good from my home.

33:26.547 --> 33:29.175
- Si! Si!
- Si.

33:48.569 --> 33:50.560
What is that?

33:50.638 --> 33:53.471
I think Raymond is in the room.

33:53.541 --> 33:56.169
- Raymond, are you in here?
- Charlie Babbitt.

33:56.243 --> 33:59.508
Well, get out!
Get out!

33:59.580 --> 34:01.514
- Go!
- Stop it.

34:04.685 --> 34:07.620
- Jesus Christ!
- Go in there with him.

34:07.688 --> 34:10.156
- Charlie, go in there.
- Why?

34:10.224 --> 34:13.681
He's afraid.
He doesn't understand this.

34:13.761 --> 34:15.695
Go in there.

34:20.134 --> 34:23.570
Raymond, what were you doin' in my room?
What were you doin' in my room?

34:23.637 --> 34:26.036
- I don't know.
- You don't know what you were doin'?

34:26.106 --> 34:29.438
-Of course, there were noises.
-Those noises are none of your business.

34:29.510 --> 34:31.774
You understand that?

34:31.844 --> 34:34.335
Stop actin' Like an idiot
and go to sleep.

34:34.415 --> 34:36.713
Did you hear what I said?
Go to sleep!

34:36.784 --> 34:38.842
- Go to sleep!
- It's nine minutes to 11:00.

34:38.918 --> 34:42.377
- Lights out at 11:00.
- Yeah, well, new rules.

34:55.335 --> 34:57.827
You don't listen to me.

34:57.905 --> 35:00.772
- What are you talkin' about?
- I asked you to apologize.

35:00.841 --> 35:04.937
- You went there and insulted him again.
- I'm not his mother.

35:05.012 --> 35:07.105
Charlie, you're his brother!

35:07.181 --> 35:09.649
They tell you today
that you have a brother...

35:09.717 --> 35:12.413
and I don't see in your face
one little reaction.

35:12.486 --> 35:16.183
- I'm not saying joy.
- You don't know what I'm goin' through.

35:16.256 --> 35:19.248
What are you going through?
Because I don't know.

35:19.326 --> 35:21.419
You don't tell me anything.

35:21.495 --> 35:24.259
- You just give me lies!
- What lies?

35:24.331 --> 35:28.495
This thing that Dr. Bruner asked you
to bring him here, this is bullshit.

35:28.569 --> 35:31.766
I know it's not true.
So tell me, why is he here?

35:31.839 --> 35:33.204
- I'm pissed at him.
- At who?

35:33.273 --> 35:36.765
- My father.
- So you bring Raymond here. Why?

35:36.844 --> 35:39.938
- 'Cause I got him and they want him!
- This makes no sense!

35:40.014 --> 35:42.380
- Raymond was left all the money.
- How much?

35:42.449 --> 35:45.577
- $3 million. Every penny of it.
- So?

35:45.653 --> 35:47.780
I'm gonna keep him
'til I get my half!

35:51.025 --> 35:54.085
What is this, huh?
Susanna?

35:55.262 --> 35:57.662
- Just take it easy.
- I've had enough.

35:57.731 --> 36:00.529
- What does that mean?
- I'm leaving.

36:00.601 --> 36:03.627
You're leaving me now?
I need you!

36:03.704 --> 36:06.229
You need nobody.

36:06.306 --> 36:08.706
What does that mean?

36:08.776 --> 36:11.643
Just take it easy!
What is my crime here?

36:11.712 --> 36:14.272
Your crime is
that you use people!

36:14.348 --> 36:18.307
- You're using Raymond, you're using me.
- I'm using Raymond?

36:18.385 --> 36:21.377
Raymond, am I using you?

36:21.955 --> 36:25.288
Shut up! He is answering a question
from a half hour ago!

36:25.359 --> 36:27.293
What good is $3 million to him?

36:27.361 --> 36:31.161
That money is only gonna sit there,
and I need that money.

36:31.231 --> 36:35.497
You need it, so it's not Like stealing.
And then what happens to Raymond?

36:35.569 --> 36:39.505
He'll go back to Wallbrook,
or I'll put him in a better place.

36:39.573 --> 36:42.974
- He is gonna be just the same.
- Only you have his money.

36:43.043 --> 36:47.377
His money? That man was my father too.
Where's my fuckin' half?

36:47.448 --> 36:50.076
- I'm entitled to that money!
- You kidnapped this man!

36:50.150 --> 36:53.278
I did not take him.
I took my half.

36:53.353 --> 36:56.322
- Charlie, you're crazy.
- It runs in the family.

36:56.390 --> 37:00.850
You're soaking wet and you're gonna
Leave in the middle of the night. Wait.

37:00.928 --> 37:04.364
My father stuck it to me all my Life.
What do you want from me?

37:04.431 --> 37:06.524
I want out.

37:58.719 --> 38:00.710
- Stop that.
- Good morning.

38:00.788 --> 38:03.621
- Coffee?
- That'd be good.

38:05.125 --> 38:09.027
Dibbs, Sally.
461-0192.

38:09.096 --> 38:11.587
How did you know
my phone number?

38:12.466 --> 38:13.899
How'd you know that?

38:13.967 --> 38:18.165
You said read the telephone book.
Dibbs, Sally. 461-0192.

38:19.106 --> 38:22.940
He remembers things,
little things, sometimes.

38:23.010 --> 38:26.639
Very clever, boys.
I'll be right back.

38:26.713 --> 38:29.580
- How'd you do that?
- I don't know.

38:29.650 --> 38:31.845
Did you memorize the whole book?

38:31.919 --> 38:34.854
- How far did you get?
- 'G.'

38:34.922 --> 38:37.220
'G.' Gottsaken, William Marshall.

38:37.291 --> 38:40.089
- You memorized to 'G'?
- Yeah, 'G.'

38:41.161 --> 38:44.688
- A, B, C, D, E, F, G?
- Half of 'G.'

38:46.700 --> 38:49.066
That's good, Ray.
I Like that.

38:53.207 --> 38:55.801
- You hungry?
- Tuesday we have pancakes.

38:55.876 --> 38:58.606
- That sounds good.
- Maple syrup.

38:58.679 --> 39:01.170
- You bet your butt.
- Bet your butt.

39:02.249 --> 39:05.116
They got pancakes.

39:06.220 --> 39:09.417
- What is this, Ray?
- I don't have my toothpicks.

39:09.489 --> 39:11.753
You don't need toothpicks.

39:11.825 --> 39:15.124
That was okay in the hotel with pizza,
but in a restaurant you use a fork.

39:15.195 --> 39:17.686
- I don't have my toothpicks.
- You don't need toothpicks.

39:17.764 --> 39:19.891
The pancakes
will keep sliding off.

39:19.967 --> 39:23.528
I don't have my maple syrup either.
I'm gonna be without my maple syrup.

39:23.604 --> 39:25.799
You don't see any pancakes,
do you?

39:25.873 --> 39:28.171
Of course,
maple syrup is not here.

39:28.242 --> 39:32.144
Ray, when we order the pancakes,
they're gonna bring the maple syrup.

39:32.212 --> 39:35.306
Maple syrup is supposed to be
on the table before the pancakes.

39:35.382 --> 39:36.815
We haven't ordered yet.

39:36.884 --> 39:40.149
Maple syrup after the pancakes
is definitely too late.

39:40.220 --> 39:44.953
How is that gonna be too late?
We haven't ordered the pancakes yet.

39:45.025 --> 39:48.392
If we're gonna be here all morning
with no maple syrup and no toothpicks...

39:48.462 --> 39:52.398
I'm definitely not gonna
have my pancakes with--

39:52.466 --> 39:54.730
Don't make a scene.

39:54.801 --> 39:57.668
Stop actin' Like a fuckin' retard.

40:19.927 --> 40:21.360
What are you writing?

40:22.429 --> 40:24.363
What the fuck is this?

40:26.333 --> 40:29.302
'Serious'-- 'Serious injury list:
Charlie Babbitt'?

40:29.369 --> 40:32.270
'Serious injury list'?
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

40:33.340 --> 40:35.706
Number 18 in 1988.

40:36.977 --> 40:39.741
Squeezed and pulled
and hurt my neck in 1988.

40:39.813 --> 40:42.441
'Squeezed and pulled and hurt
your neck in 1988'?

40:45.118 --> 40:47.052
Dr. Bruner, it's Charlie Babbitt.

40:47.120 --> 40:48.587
Where are you, son?

40:48.655 --> 40:50.919
That's not important.
What matters is who I'm with.

40:50.991 --> 40:53.721
You have to bring him back,
Mr. Babbitt. Do you understand me?

40:53.794 --> 40:54.920
No problem.

40:54.995 --> 40:58.192
That will be $1.5 million.
I'm not greedy. I just want my half.

40:58.265 --> 40:59.698
Don't touch that.

40:59.766 --> 41:02.826
I can't do that, Mr. Babbitt.
You know I can't.

41:02.903 --> 41:05.303
Just bring him back,
and bring him back now.

41:05.372 --> 41:06.805
He belongs here.

41:06.873 --> 41:10.036
I'm his brother.
It's not Like kidnapping here, is it?

41:10.110 --> 41:13.136
He's always been a voluntary patient
here, but that's beside the point.

41:13.213 --> 41:16.273
This is where he can get
the best care.

41:16.350 --> 41:18.511
We're talking about his well-being.

41:18.585 --> 41:21.213
Yeah. Let's just cut through
the bullshit, okay?

41:21.288 --> 41:23.256
I am entitled to part
of my father's estate.

41:23.323 --> 41:26.622
If you won't cut a deal with me,
I'll fly him back to Los Angeles...

41:26.693 --> 41:28.627
I'll stick him in an institution
out there...

41:28.695 --> 41:32.153
and we can have
a custody battle over him.

41:32.232 --> 41:33.961
Miss, he needs toothpicks.

41:34.034 --> 41:36.127
Could you get him some?
Thank you.

41:36.203 --> 41:38.228
Now, you wanna battle me
in the courts?

41:38.305 --> 41:41.570
You think about that, Dr. Bruner.
Think about that.

41:41.641 --> 41:43.609
Or we can cut a deal right now.

41:43.710 --> 41:47.168
I don't think you have any idea
of the severity of Raymond's condition.

41:47.247 --> 41:49.010
Toothpicks. He needs toothpicks.

41:49.082 --> 41:52.108
Can we just get him
some toothpicks?

41:52.185 --> 41:54.551
I cannot make
money deals with you.

41:54.621 --> 41:56.555
Then I'll see you in court.

42:00.861 --> 42:04.126
Can I have the check?
Sorry about the toothpicks.

42:04.197 --> 42:06.665
82, 82, 82.

42:06.733 --> 42:08.428
82 what, Ray?

42:08.502 --> 42:10.936
- How much is this?
- Toothpicks.

42:13.106 --> 42:15.040
That's more than 82 toothpicks.

42:15.108 --> 42:18.271
246 total.

42:18.345 --> 42:19.676
Keep the change.

42:20.747 --> 42:23.341
How many toothpicks are in there?

42:23.417 --> 42:26.648
- 250.
- Pretty close. Let's go, Ray.

42:26.720 --> 42:28.210
246.

42:29.890 --> 42:31.653
There's four left in the box.

42:33.226 --> 42:35.319
I have to get my backpack.

42:38.331 --> 42:40.891
97X.

42:40.967 --> 42:43.458
The future of rock and roll.

42:44.538 --> 42:46.233
97X.

42:47.407 --> 42:49.705
The future of rock and roll.

42:52.379 --> 42:54.108
97X.

42:55.849 --> 42:57.874
The future of rock and roll.

43:02.956 --> 43:05.083
The future of rock and roll.

43:05.158 --> 43:06.147
Ray.

43:06.226 --> 43:08.194
Enough already.
Change the channel.

43:10.397 --> 43:13.059
The future of rock and roll.

43:19.339 --> 43:22.433
Lenny, I don't care what you think.
Did they say that?

43:22.509 --> 43:24.704
You're gonna have to be
more forceful with them.

43:24.778 --> 43:27.303
Lenny, are you--
Lenny, shut up a moment.

43:27.380 --> 43:30.213
I am in serious trouble.
I can't get to these cars.

43:30.283 --> 43:32.342
I can't get the money.
Do you understand that?

43:32.419 --> 43:35.081
- My Loan is past due.
- I'll call the Loan officer...

43:35.155 --> 43:37.316
tell him we have
a little problem.

43:38.425 --> 43:41.758
- Listen, Charlie, let me talk--
- Lenny, just listen to me.

43:41.828 --> 43:43.853
I'll be in LAX
in three hours, okay?

43:43.930 --> 43:47.832
Now, remember, the Buick
is in A-3, main terminal.

43:47.901 --> 43:50.870
Make sure they pick it up.
All right? See you in a few.

43:55.909 --> 43:59.106
Will Dr. Andrew Baker...

43:59.179 --> 44:01.807
please pick up
a white courtesy phone?

44:01.882 --> 44:03.816
- Dr. Andrew Baker.
- Raymond, let's go.

44:05.886 --> 44:08.650
Ray, let's go. Come on.

44:11.024 --> 44:13.754
- What were you watching?
- I don't know.

44:13.827 --> 44:15.124
You don't know?

44:15.195 --> 44:18.653
Final call for flight 1559...

44:18.732 --> 44:22.356
service to Salt Lake City
and Los Angeles.

44:23.257 --> 44:26.283
There's an airplane out there.

44:26.360 --> 44:28.385
That's right,
and everybody's boarding. Let's go.

44:28.463 --> 44:30.397
- Airline travel's very dangerous.
- Don't be silly.

44:30.465 --> 44:32.865
It's the safest travel in the world.
You'll love this. Trust me.

44:33.668 --> 44:35.158
Now come on.

44:37.772 --> 44:40.036
We're in an airport.
People fly out of airports.

44:40.107 --> 44:42.667
- Why do you think we're here?
- Flying's very dangerous.

44:42.743 --> 44:44.677
In 1987, there were
30 airline accidents.

44:44.745 --> 44:47.942
211 were fatalities
and 230 were definitely passengers.

44:48.015 --> 44:49.949
This plane is very safe.
Believe me.

44:50.017 --> 44:52.212
I gotta get to L.A.
I don't have time for this shit.

44:52.286 --> 44:54.914
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

44:54.989 --> 44:56.581
- You don't know?
- No.

44:56.657 --> 44:58.784
- Is it this airline?
- Yeah.

44:58.860 --> 45:03.092
Okay, fine. We can--
There's an American plane.

45:03.164 --> 45:04.893
American flight 625...

45:04.966 --> 45:07.491
crashed April 27, 1976.

45:08.736 --> 45:10.795
We don't have to take American.
There's a lot of flights.

45:10.872 --> 45:12.134
Pick another airline.

45:12.206 --> 45:16.575
- Continental. We'll take Continental.
- Continental crashed November 15, 1987.

45:16.644 --> 45:19.112
Flight 1713. 28 casualties.

45:20.314 --> 45:22.248
- This is very serious.
- Yeah, very serious.

45:22.316 --> 45:25.808
I have to get to Los Angeles.
So you're gonna get on that plane.

45:25.887 --> 45:27.411
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

45:27.488 --> 45:29.718
- You have to get on a plane.
- Yeah.

45:31.392 --> 45:33.656
Now, there's a Delta.

45:33.728 --> 45:35.923
- Yeah.
- It leaves at midnight.

45:35.997 --> 45:37.123
How's Delta?

45:37.198 --> 45:40.690
Delta crashed August 2, 1985.
Lockheed L-1011.

45:40.768 --> 45:42.759
Dallas-Fort Worth.
Terrible wind shear.

45:42.837 --> 45:45.032
- All airlines--
- 135 passengers.

45:45.106 --> 45:47.506
All airlines have crashed
at one time or another.

45:47.575 --> 45:49.543
That doesn't mean
that they are not safe.

45:49.610 --> 45:51.339
- Quantas.
- Quantas?

45:51.412 --> 45:52.970
Quantas never crashed.

45:54.081 --> 45:56.015
- Quantas?
- Never crashed.

45:57.552 --> 45:59.213
- Well, that's--
- Never crashed.

45:59.287 --> 46:01.221
That's gonna do me
a lot of good.

46:01.289 --> 46:03.723
Quantas doesn't fly to L.A.
out of Cincinnati.

46:03.791 --> 46:06.259
- You have got to get to Melbourne...
- Australia.

46:06.327 --> 46:08.659
in order to get the plane
that flies to Los Angeles.

46:08.729 --> 46:10.424
- Do you hear me?
- Canberra's the capital.

46:10.498 --> 46:12.193
- 16.2 million population.
- Let's go.

46:12.266 --> 46:13.597
Very lovely beaches.

46:13.668 --> 46:16.569
We're getting on this plane!

46:21.242 --> 46:22.732
Ray! Ray! Ray!

46:26.881 --> 46:29.509
We're not gonna take the plane.
He's okay. He's okay!

46:29.584 --> 46:31.575
We're not gonna take the plane.

46:33.254 --> 46:35.313
Just relax.
He was upset.

46:35.389 --> 46:38.381
We were gonna take the plane.
We're not gonna take it now.

46:38.459 --> 46:41.087
- We're not gonna fly, okay?
- No flying.

46:44.365 --> 46:46.663
- We're not gonna fly.
- No flying.

46:47.835 --> 46:49.769
- You tire me, Ray.
- Yeah.

46:49.837 --> 46:51.930
We're gonna drive to Los Angeles.

46:53.074 --> 46:55.008
Okay? Come on, Ray.

46:55.076 --> 46:56.566
Ray? Come on.

46:56.644 --> 46:58.407
- Yeah.

- We're not taking the plane.

47:00.481 --> 47:02.540
- Just grab the fuckin' bag.
- No flying.

47:04.318 --> 47:07.287
You're killin' me, Ray.
I just want you to know.

47:07.355 --> 47:09.289
- No flying.
- I gotta be in L.A. in three hours.

47:09.357 --> 47:11.325
It's gonna take me three days.

47:11.392 --> 47:12.791
Come on!

47:15.663 --> 47:17.062
No flying.

47:17.131 --> 47:18.723
- No flying.
- No flying.

47:20.901 --> 47:23.597
I got 'Jeopardy' at 5:00.

47:23.671 --> 47:26.003
- I watch 'Jeopardy' at 5:00.
- Don't start with that.

47:26.073 --> 47:28.007
'Jeopardy' at 5:00.

48:02.543 --> 48:05.205
- Dispatch, this is 1-0-9.
- Go ahead, 1-0-9.

48:05.279 --> 48:07.907
Can you get another unit here
for point control?

48:07.982 --> 48:10.450
Two more over to you. 10-40.

48:12.353 --> 48:14.014
Let's go!

48:16.590 --> 48:18.615
- Bring some more up.
- What's your E.T.A.?

48:21.896 --> 48:22.954
Ray?

48:23.864 --> 48:25.923
Get in the car.

48:26.867 --> 48:29.028
Get in the car.
Are you crazy?

48:29.103 --> 48:30.934
We'll be outta this in a second.

48:31.005 --> 48:32.495
- Yeah.
- That's good.

48:32.573 --> 48:34.700
It's okay. That's right.

48:34.775 --> 48:37.608
Yeah. We'll be outta here
in a few seconds. That's good.

48:37.678 --> 48:41.011
- That's good. That's good.
- There's a fatal accident over there.

48:42.783 --> 48:45.274
We don't need your help.
Go back to your car.

48:45.352 --> 48:47.479
Just a minute!

48:51.058 --> 48:53.686
Son of a bitch! Ray?

48:55.129 --> 48:56.460
Excuse-- Hey--

48:56.530 --> 48:58.521
- Just wait--
- There's nothing to see here.

48:58.599 --> 49:00.863
- Go back to your car.
- Yes, sir.

49:00.935 --> 49:03.335
- Wrecks make him nervous.
- Get in your car.

49:03.404 --> 49:05.964
Yes, sir. Just stay there
by the side, okay, Raymond?

49:06.040 --> 49:08.065
- Ray. Just stay there.
- A lot of traffic.

49:08.142 --> 49:10.508
Yeah.
Definitely a lot of traffic.

49:11.579 --> 49:13.513
A lot of work for $3 million.

49:13.581 --> 49:16.209
I'd Like to Leave him on the highway
and get outta here.

49:16.283 --> 49:18.979
What? I hear ya! I hear ya!

49:23.824 --> 49:26.486
- Memorial Hospital is ready--
- Stay in your car!

49:33.601 --> 49:35.535
What's it gonna be, Ray?

49:35.603 --> 49:37.571
This is
a very dangerous highway.

49:37.638 --> 49:39.105
How will I get to L.A.?

49:39.173 --> 49:41.733
Driving a car on this interstate
is very dangerous.

49:41.809 --> 49:43.902
You wanna get off the highway?
Will that make you happy?

49:43.978 --> 49:46.208
- Yeah.
- Well, you gotta get in the car...

49:46.280 --> 49:48.214
in order to get off the highway!

49:48.282 --> 49:51.217
In 1986, 46,400 male drivers
were involved in fatal accidents.

49:54.255 --> 49:56.348
I got a great idea.

49:56.423 --> 49:59.119
You'll stay in front of the car
until we get off the exit.

49:59.193 --> 50:02.959
You'll get in, and we'll take
the not-so-dangerous road.

50:03.030 --> 50:04.463
- Is that an idea?
- Yeah.

50:04.532 --> 50:06.796
Give me five, Ray.
That's a great idea.

50:06.867 --> 50:09.563
Give me five. Yeah.
This guy's a fuckin' fruitcake.

50:17.845 --> 50:20.643
I'm asking you. Who's on first?
That's the man's name.

50:20.714 --> 50:23.342
That's whose name? Yes.
Go ahead and tell me.

50:23.417 --> 50:25.977
Who? The guy on first.
Who? The first baseman.

50:26.053 --> 50:27.213
Who is on first.

50:28.122 --> 50:30.454
Whose wife? Yes.

50:30.524 --> 50:32.788
- After all, the man earns it.
- Who does?

50:32.860 --> 50:33.792
Absolutely.

50:33.861 --> 50:36.489
All I'm tryin' to find out
is what the guy's name on first base.

50:36.564 --> 50:38.498
No, what is on second base.

50:38.566 --> 50:41.296
I'm not asking you who's on second base?
Who's on first?

50:41.368 --> 50:43.666
- That's what I'm tryin' to find out.
- Get in the car!

50:43.737 --> 50:45.967
Don't change the players.
Yeah, get in the car.

50:46.040 --> 50:49.134
Get in the car. Yeah.
I have to be in bed by 11:00.

50:49.210 --> 50:51.678
Lights out at 11:00.
Have to watch TV.

50:57.685 --> 50:59.880
Now it's almost
19 minutes to 11:00.

50:59.954 --> 51:02.013
We have to be in bed by 11:00.
Lights out.

51:02.089 --> 51:04.023
We're not flying.
We're not on the interstate.

51:04.091 --> 51:06.924
I'm on some shit secondary road.
I gotta make up time.

51:06.994 --> 51:08.985
I should've been in Los Angeles
this afternoon.

51:09.063 --> 51:10.928
My business needs me.
I gotta make up time.

51:10.998 --> 51:14.695
Definitely watch TV, but be
in bed by 11:00. Lights out.

51:14.768 --> 51:15.962
Forget it.

51:16.036 --> 51:17.970
19 minutes to 11:00.

51:32.086 --> 51:34.987
This is a good one.
'We don't go out when it rains.'

51:35.055 --> 51:37.489
This is a good one.
I hope you appreciate this...

51:37.558 --> 51:39.958
because my business
is going down the toilet.

51:40.027 --> 51:41.654
I should be in L.A.

51:41.729 --> 51:45.722
Instead I'm in the Honeymoon Haven Motel
in Bumblefuck, Missouri...

51:45.799 --> 51:47.892
because you won't
go out when it rains.

51:47.968 --> 51:51.062
It's mystifying. It really is.
Fuckin' mystifying.

51:54.775 --> 51:57.471
What is this?
Good news, bad news?

51:58.479 --> 52:00.413
We passed D.O.T.
but failed E.P.A. again.

52:00.481 --> 52:02.574
It all ends up the same.
I can't get my money.

52:02.650 --> 52:06.051
Well, yes, sir. I'm just stuck
in Cincinnati since the funeral.

52:06.120 --> 52:09.055
So many leftover details.
My family is...

52:09.123 --> 52:11.216
needless to say,
quite overwhelmed.

52:11.292 --> 52:13.522
Yeah, well, thank you.
I appreciate it.

52:13.594 --> 52:15.721
It is a shock, to say the least.

52:17.231 --> 52:19.893
Thank you. Can I get
an extension on that Loan?

52:19.967 --> 52:22.936
A couple of days
would make a big difference.

52:30.577 --> 52:33.045
'We don't go out when it's raining.'

52:37.484 --> 52:39.418
What? Speak up, Lenny.

52:39.486 --> 52:41.420
I didn't buy that kind of time.

52:41.488 --> 52:43.456
I want you to go down--
How much?

52:43.524 --> 52:44.752
- It's 12:30.
- What?

52:44.825 --> 52:46.258
Lunch is 12:30.

52:46.327 --> 52:48.693
- Hold on. What do you want for lunch?
- Wednesday's fish sticks.

52:48.762 --> 52:50.627
- Fish sticks?
- Green lime Jell-O for dessert.

52:50.698 --> 52:53.565
Green lime Jell-O.
Want another apple juice?

52:53.634 --> 52:56.364
I want orange soda.
Oh, it's 12:31.

52:56.437 --> 52:58.371
I gotta go.
He's startin' to rock and moan.

52:58.439 --> 53:00.873
- 12:32. Definitely 12:32.
- It's okay. No.

53:00.941 --> 53:03.068
- Give me that gun.
- Where is he?

53:04.478 --> 53:05.706
Where is he?

53:05.779 --> 53:07.747
How did you figure
to frame Vargas with it?

53:07.815 --> 53:10.807
'Frame'? Where is he?

53:10.884 --> 53:12.943
- There's four fish sticks.
- Huh?

53:13.020 --> 53:15.454
There's supposed to be eight.
There's only four.

53:15.522 --> 53:17.285
There's eight.

53:17.358 --> 53:19.588
You take a shower, Ray?

53:19.660 --> 53:22.959
- Ray, you take a shower, right?
- Yeah.

53:23.030 --> 53:25.658
It's the same as the rain.
You get a little wet.

53:25.733 --> 53:28.167
What do you say, Ray?

53:28.235 --> 53:30.203
'Course, the shower's
in the bathroom.

53:31.372 --> 53:33.101
That's the end
of that conversation.

53:34.241 --> 53:36.175
- Go again.
- British Poetry for 200.

53:36.243 --> 53:41.044
The answer: 'Shakespeare wrote
over 150 poems in this 14-line form.'

53:41.115 --> 53:43.083
- What is a sonnet?
- What is a sonnet?

53:43.150 --> 53:45.084
- You got it.
- Double letters for 200.

53:45.152 --> 53:49.521
The top of that one. 'The last word
in the Pledge of Allegiance.' Mark.

53:49.590 --> 53:50.955
- What is 'stands'?
- No.

53:51.025 --> 53:52.458
Stu, Stu, Stu.

53:52.526 --> 53:56.360
Legally, Bruner never established
a conservatorship of Raymond?

53:58.599 --> 54:01.261
He didn't figure anyone would show up
to contest his authority.

54:01.335 --> 54:04.634
If that's the case,
I definitely will get custody...

54:04.705 --> 54:06.639
and the $3 million, right?

54:06.707 --> 54:11.167
And you set up a date-- Yeah, you set up
a date for the custody hearing.

54:11.245 --> 54:13.713
Stu, I want a firm date,
and I want it early.

54:13.781 --> 54:16.272
I found that it wasn't
an original record...

54:16.350 --> 54:18.511
because the original song
had two verses--

54:18.585 --> 54:22.021
She hasn't come in?
She hasn't called?

54:22.089 --> 54:25.058
If you hear from her, tell her
to call me at this number.

54:37.771 --> 54:40.433
The Air Alpha Force,
from Nike.

54:43.377 --> 54:46.904
Look at that.
1957 Studebaker Goldenhawk.

54:46.980 --> 54:48.470
0 to 60 in under 8 seconds.

54:48.549 --> 54:51.017
275 supercharged horsepower
under that hood.

54:51.085 --> 54:53.576
- It's beautiful.
- 'Course, I'm an excellent driver.

54:53.654 --> 54:55.588
- You know how to drive?
- Yeah.

54:56.557 --> 54:57.819
When did you drive?

54:57.891 --> 55:00.826
I drove the Buick on the driveway
when my dad came to Wallbrook.

55:02.596 --> 55:04.894
Was Dad in the car, Ray?

55:04.965 --> 55:06.091
Yeah.

55:07.734 --> 55:10.703
- He let you drive the Buick?
- Yeah, slow on the driveway.

55:12.806 --> 55:15.001
We'll have to let you
drive sometime.

55:17.511 --> 55:20.878
You never touch this steering wheel
when I'm driving! Do you hear me?

55:20.948 --> 55:22.074
- Yeah.
- Do you hear me?

55:22.149 --> 55:25.050
- I don't have my underwear.
- What?

55:25.119 --> 55:27.053
I'm definitely not wearing
my underwear.

55:27.121 --> 55:30.215
-I gave you a pair of mine this morning.
-They're not my underwear.

55:31.658 --> 55:33.922
I told you to put 'em on.
Where are they?

55:33.994 --> 55:36.087
They're in the pocket of my jacket.

55:36.163 --> 55:37.460
- Where?
- Here.

55:38.832 --> 55:41.027
- These are too tight.
- I don't want them back.

55:41.101 --> 55:43.729
- Mine are boxer shorts.
- What's the difference?

55:43.804 --> 55:46.568
- These are Hanes 32.
- Underwear is underwear.

55:46.640 --> 55:48.699
My boxer shorts have my name.
It says 'Raymond.'

55:48.775 --> 55:51.903
All right. When we pass a store,
we'll pick up some boxer shorts.

55:51.979 --> 55:54.846
I get my boxer shorts
at Kmart in Cincinnati.

55:54.915 --> 55:57.179
We're not going back.
Don't start with that.

55:57.251 --> 55:59.219
- 400 Oak Street.
- We're not going back.

55:59.286 --> 56:01.481
You don't have to go
to Cincinnati for boxer shorts.

56:01.555 --> 56:03.955
- Oak and Burnett in Cincinnati.
- What did I say?

56:04.024 --> 56:06.584
- It's Kmart.
- I know you hear me.

56:06.660 --> 56:09.288
- My boxer shorts have--
- You don't fool me.

56:09.363 --> 56:10.455
Yours are too tight.

56:10.531 --> 56:13.432
Did you fuckin' hear what I said?

56:13.500 --> 56:14.592
Shut up!

56:17.971 --> 56:20.030
Cincinnati's a Long way off.

56:20.107 --> 56:22.940
You're getting further away
from Kmart.

56:23.010 --> 56:25.740
You don't have to go to Cincinnati
to get underwear at Kmart.

56:25.812 --> 56:27.746
You have to go to Kmart,
400 Oak Street.

56:27.814 --> 56:30.078
We are not going to Cincinnati,
and that's final.

56:30.150 --> 56:33.677
- Get my boxer shorts at Kmart.
- That is final. Did you hear me?

56:40.160 --> 56:43.095
I'm goin' out of my mind!

56:43.163 --> 56:47.361
What difference does it make
where you buy underwear?

56:47.434 --> 56:51.063
What difference does it make?
Underwear is underwear!

56:51.138 --> 56:54.630
It is underwear wherever you buy it,
in Cincinnati or wherever!

56:55.742 --> 56:57.733
- Kmart.
- You know what I think?

56:57.811 --> 57:01.144
I think this autism
is a bunch of shit.

57:01.215 --> 57:04.241
You can't tell me that you're
not in there somewhere.

57:04.318 --> 57:05.649
Boxer shorts.

57:06.553 --> 57:08.145
Boxer shorts. Kmart.

57:09.456 --> 57:11.287
These are--
These are Hanes 32.

57:12.359 --> 57:14.725
- Driving me crazy.
- Mine are boxer shorts.

57:14.795 --> 57:17.491
We have to make a little stop,
find a psychiatrist...

57:17.564 --> 57:19.498
'cause you're driving me crazy.

57:19.566 --> 57:21.500
- Oak and Burnett.
- You are driving me--

57:21.568 --> 57:23.627
We have to buy them at Kmart,
Oak and Burnett...

57:23.704 --> 57:25.399
back in--

57:25.472 --> 57:28.737
You put your shorts
on the highway.

57:28.809 --> 57:31.141
We have to go back
to Cincinnati and Kmart.

57:56.871 --> 57:59.305
Good luck finding
a shrink in this town.

58:30.739 --> 58:31.831
Raymond?

59:13.348 --> 59:15.111
Hey, you.

59:15.183 --> 59:16.946
Dipshit, move it!

59:20.688 --> 59:22.622
If you ain't gonna move,
I'll move you.

59:22.690 --> 59:24.783
Hey, buddy.

59:24.859 --> 59:26.326
You'll get run over.

59:26.394 --> 59:28.885
- You're gonna get hurt.
- It said, 'Don't walk.'

59:28.963 --> 59:31.693
- Do you hear me?
- It said, 'Don't walk.'

59:31.766 --> 59:35.224
- Move it.
- Hey, it's all right, sir.

59:35.303 --> 59:37.294
I'm sorry. Raymond?

59:37.372 --> 59:38.532
- Yeah.
- Come on.

59:38.606 --> 59:41.575
- It's all right.
- Gotta get to Kmart.

59:41.643 --> 59:43.577
Raymond, come on.

59:43.645 --> 59:45.670
Kmart, 400 Oak Street.

59:45.747 --> 59:47.681
- It said, 'Don't walk.'
- Yes, it's broken.

59:47.749 --> 59:49.683
It said, 'Don't walk.'

59:50.752 --> 59:52.845
- This way.
- Have to get to Kmart.

59:52.921 --> 59:55.651
400 Oak and Burnett.

59:58.793 --> 01:00:01.057
He said, 'Young man, go west'...

01:00:01.129 --> 01:00:03.597
and this is the way
our country developed...

01:00:03.665 --> 01:00:06.395
from the East Coast
to the West Coast.

01:00:06.468 --> 01:00:09.232
During that period of time...

01:00:09.304 --> 01:00:11.829
there was initiated...

01:00:11.906 --> 01:00:16.104
what was known as
the Pony Express.

01:00:16.177 --> 01:00:19.977
I'm sure you have read something about
it in the history of the United States.

01:00:20.048 --> 01:00:22.881
I may not have the days
or the years exactly right...

01:00:22.951 --> 01:00:27.547
but I'm more or less familiar
with the history of the United States.

01:00:27.622 --> 01:00:30.455
- I love to tell the story--
- He's 'artistic'?

01:00:30.525 --> 01:00:32.083
No, he's autistic.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.890
I'm not familiar with that.

01:00:34.963 --> 01:00:36.863
What is the exact nature
of the problem?

01:00:36.931 --> 01:00:38.455
...in St. Joe's, Missouri--

01:00:38.533 --> 01:00:40.865
He lives in a world of his own.

01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:44.564
I'm sorry,
but what's wrong with him?

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.699
It was a problem gettin' mail
from the East Coast--

01:00:47.775 --> 01:00:51.871
-Raymond, do 'What's On First?' for her.
-Who's on first. What's on second.

01:00:54.482 --> 01:00:58.418
They set up an initial program...

01:00:58.486 --> 01:01:00.545
where the Pony Express...

01:01:00.622 --> 01:01:04.615
would ride for approximately
20 miles--

01:01:04.692 --> 01:01:07.422
What am I supposed to do?

01:01:07.495 --> 01:01:10.259
There's gotta be something
that I can do here.

01:01:10.331 --> 01:01:12.265
Well, I'm not a psychiatrist...

01:01:12.333 --> 01:01:14.927
but I do know his brain doesn't work
Like other people.

01:01:15.003 --> 01:01:16.971
What he does
isn't intended to be annoying.

01:01:17.038 --> 01:01:20.064
If he's gettin' on your nerves,
take a break.

01:01:20.141 --> 01:01:23.008
- Spend time away from him.
- I'll just send him back.

01:01:23.077 --> 01:01:25.068
- Sorry?
- Nothing.

01:01:25.146 --> 01:01:28.274
Inside joke. You're telling me
I just have to deal with this?

01:01:28.349 --> 01:01:30.442
I just gotta deal with it.

01:01:30.518 --> 01:01:33.419
Yeah, that's about it.

01:01:33.488 --> 01:01:36.423
Out of curiosity, does he have
any special abilities?

01:01:38.393 --> 01:01:40.361
Well, he's got
a pretty good memory.

01:01:40.428 --> 01:01:42.419
He counts toothpicks.

01:01:42.497 --> 01:01:44.692
They spilled a box of toothpicks
on the floor...

01:01:44.766 --> 01:01:47.735
and he took one look and knew
exactly how many there were.

01:01:47.802 --> 01:01:51.067
- He counted 'em in seconds.
- Ray.

01:01:51.139 --> 01:01:52.436
- Raymond.
- Yeah.

01:01:52.507 --> 01:01:54.475
Are you good with numbers?

01:01:54.542 --> 01:01:57.375
- Yeah.
- I read about this.

01:01:57.445 --> 01:01:59.504
- I wanna try somethin' here.
- Kmart, 400 Oak Street.

01:01:59.581 --> 01:02:01.913
What'd I tell you?
After this.

01:02:01.983 --> 01:02:04.451
- Ray, can we try somethin'?
- Yeah.

01:02:04.519 --> 01:02:07.454
Do you know how much 312...

01:02:07.522 --> 01:02:09.820
times 123 is?

01:02:09.891 --> 01:02:12.382
38,376.

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:14.018
He's right.

01:02:14.095 --> 01:02:15.858
- What?
- He's right.

01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:17.898
- He's right?
- Yeah. Ray.

01:02:17.966 --> 01:02:21.367
How much is 4,343...

01:02:21.436 --> 01:02:24.633
times 1,234?

01:02:24.706 --> 01:02:26.697
5,359,262.

01:02:26.774 --> 01:02:28.742
- He's a genius.
- That's right.

01:02:29.811 --> 01:02:31.802
- He's a genius.
- Ray.

01:02:31.879 --> 01:02:35.246
Do you know how much
the square root of 2,130 is?

01:02:36.851 --> 01:02:40.651
46.15192304.

01:02:41.389 --> 01:02:43.550
- 2304.
- That's amazing.

01:02:43.625 --> 01:02:46.719
That is amazing. He should
work for NASA or something.

01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:52.657
If you had a dollar,
and you spent 50 cents...

01:02:52.734 --> 01:02:54.827
how much money
would you have left?

01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.766
About 70.

01:02:59.841 --> 01:03:01.775
- Seventy cents?
- Seventy cents.

01:03:01.843 --> 01:03:04.937
- So much for NASA.
- We should go to Kmart.

01:03:05.013 --> 01:03:06.674
After this, Ray.

01:03:06.748 --> 01:03:08.409
400 Oak Street.

01:03:08.483 --> 01:03:10.417
Do you know how much
a candy bar costs?

01:03:11.586 --> 01:03:14.180
- About $100.
- $100, huh?

01:03:14.255 --> 01:03:16.587
You know how much one of those
new compact cars costs?

01:03:16.658 --> 01:03:18.148
About $100.

01:03:19.527 --> 01:03:23.293
In his case, he's pretty well off.
He's very high-functioning.

01:03:23.364 --> 01:03:27.733
Most autistics can't speak
or communicate.

01:03:29.337 --> 01:03:31.396
Do you know what 'autistic' is?

01:03:31.472 --> 01:03:32.962
- Yeah.
- You know that word?

01:03:35.677 --> 01:03:37.611
Are you autistic?

01:03:39.113 --> 01:03:40.580
I don't think so.

01:03:41.649 --> 01:03:44.117
No. Definitely not.

01:03:49.057 --> 01:03:50.820
...problem with the Lamborghinis.

01:03:50.892 --> 01:03:53.292
Let me see if I understand this.

01:03:53.361 --> 01:03:56.296
It's gonna cost me
$10,000 additional for each car.

01:03:56.364 --> 01:04:00.357
- It's very crowded in here.
- Ray, please, just one second, okay?

01:04:00.435 --> 01:04:01.697
What?

01:04:01.769 --> 01:04:04.101
They wanna take out the manifold
and the carburetors...

01:04:04.172 --> 01:04:06.231
in order to put in
a fuel injection system now?

01:04:06.307 --> 01:04:07.774
That is nonsense.

01:04:07.842 --> 01:04:10.572
- What are you doing?
- Too crowded in here for a backpack.

01:04:10.645 --> 01:04:15.082
Just Leave this on. It's gonna cost me
$40,000 just to meet E.P.A. now.

01:04:15.149 --> 01:04:16.776
What? No.

01:04:16.851 --> 01:04:20.617
You give me the number.
I'll call the conversion shop myself.

01:04:20.688 --> 01:04:22.622
That's my pen.
That's definitely my book.

01:04:22.690 --> 01:04:24.851
Taking your book
is not a serious injury.

01:04:24.926 --> 01:04:27.360
For serious injury, look at
the red book. That book is blue.

01:04:27.428 --> 01:04:30.158
Forgive me. I've lost
my secret decoder ring. 4-5-4-5.

01:04:30.231 --> 01:04:32.961
- You're already number 18.
- Got it. 1988, I know.

01:04:33.034 --> 01:04:35.264
It's my book.
That's my pen.

01:04:35.336 --> 01:04:37.361
12 minutes to Wapner.

01:04:37.438 --> 01:04:41.101
- It's definitely very small in here.
- Small... and safe.

01:04:41.175 --> 01:04:43.905
- You don't wanna miss the party.
- What you're witnessing is real.

01:04:43.978 --> 01:04:46.811
Do you know that?
There's a party in your honor, Ray.

01:04:46.881 --> 01:04:49.975
When we get to L.A., a custody hearing.
My lawyer's setting it up.

01:04:50.051 --> 01:04:52.952
You know why there's a party for you?
'Cause you're the 3-million-dollar man.

01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:54.954
- What you are witnessing is real.
- Ken Aldorf.

01:04:55.022 --> 01:04:56.956
- The participants are not actors.
- Charlie Babbitt.

01:04:57.024 --> 01:04:59.458
- Fart.
- Yeah, I'll hold.

01:04:59.527 --> 01:05:01.620
- Fart.
- Did you fart?

01:05:01.696 --> 01:05:03.823
- Fart.
- Did you fuckin' fart?

01:05:03.898 --> 01:05:06.833
Oh, man.
Get the smell out.

01:05:08.169 --> 01:05:11.195
- How can you stand that?
- I don't mind it.

01:05:11.272 --> 01:05:13.206
- Ken Aldorf.
- Ten minutes to Wapner.

01:05:13.274 --> 01:05:15.208
Ken? How are you?
This is Charlie Babbitt.

01:05:15.276 --> 01:05:17.210
We're definitely locked in this box
with no TV.

01:05:17.278 --> 01:05:19.473
I just heard about this $10,000 charge
for every car.

01:05:19.547 --> 01:05:21.811
- They're definitely gonna start--
- How can this be?

01:05:21.883 --> 01:05:25.785
- 'People's Court' starts on the--
- You're telling me another $40,000.

01:05:25.853 --> 01:05:28.549
They start on the button.
They definitely start on the button.

01:05:28.623 --> 01:05:31.592
I've got a problem.
I'll call you from my next stop.

01:05:31.659 --> 01:05:34.423
We're not gonna make it
to the program.

01:05:34.495 --> 01:05:37.055
- Definitely have to go now.
- Yes, we're going, Ray.

01:05:37.131 --> 01:05:39.565
- Just take it easy.
- Eight minutes to Wapner.

01:05:39.634 --> 01:05:41.727
Where am I gonna find
a television around here?

01:05:41.803 --> 01:05:44.465
- Eight minutes to Wapner.
- We got eight minutes to Wapner.

01:06:01.659 --> 01:06:03.650
Come on. Come on.

01:06:04.562 --> 01:06:06.587
You wanna get in there
and see the show?

01:06:06.664 --> 01:06:09.963
Wanna get in and see the show?
Listen up.

01:06:10.034 --> 01:06:13.128
There's not another farmhouse
in sight. This is it.

01:06:15.973 --> 01:06:18.373
You act weird, we don't get in.
You Listening to me?

01:06:18.442 --> 01:06:20.376
- Yeah.
- I want you to look normal.

01:06:20.444 --> 01:06:22.469
As normal as possible, all right?

01:06:22.546 --> 01:06:24.673
Just put your hands down.
Don't rock and moan.

01:06:24.749 --> 01:06:27.309
- Four minutes to Wapner.
- Just shut up and stand there.

01:06:27.385 --> 01:06:30.548
- Yeah. Uh--
- Don't rock and moan.

01:06:30.621 --> 01:06:32.179
Put your hands down.

01:06:35.526 --> 01:06:39.462
Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm Donald
Clemons from the A.C. Nielsen Company.

01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:42.931
- You're familiar with our work?
- You mean the TV ratings?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.935
Yes, ma'am. You've been selected
as a preliminary candidate...

01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:49.097
to become our next Nielsen family
in the tri-county area.

01:06:49.173 --> 01:06:52.199
- My husband's not home.
- If selected, you'll help shape...

01:06:52.276 --> 01:06:56.042
television programming
viewed by our entire nation...

01:06:56.113 --> 01:06:58.138
in return for which
you'll receive a check...

01:06:58.215 --> 01:07:00.809
in the amount of $286 each month.

01:07:00.885 --> 01:07:02.876
Who's he?

01:07:02.954 --> 01:07:06.651
That would be my partner,
Mr. Bainbridge, who does sample--

01:07:10.328 --> 01:07:13.263
- That's it.
- Oh, boy.

01:07:13.331 --> 01:07:14.662
You'll miss your program.

01:07:14.732 --> 01:07:17.132
- It's finished.
- One minute to Wapner.

01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:18.930
One minute to Wapner.

01:07:19.003 --> 01:07:22.336
I had you in there, Ray!

01:07:22.406 --> 01:07:24.567
Defendants! Plaintiffs!
You had it all!

01:07:24.642 --> 01:07:27.668
They're in there
making legal history, Ray.

01:07:27.745 --> 01:07:29.679
- Legal history.
- Oh, boy!

01:07:29.747 --> 01:07:32.113
- Oh, boy.
- What is going on out here?

01:07:32.183 --> 01:07:36.643
I'm sorry, ma'am. I lied to you.
That man is my brother.

01:07:36.721 --> 01:07:38.848
If he doesn't watch 'People's Court'
in about 30 seconds...

01:07:38.923 --> 01:07:40.857
he'll have a fit on your porch.

01:07:40.925 --> 01:07:43.917
Now, you can help me, or you
can stand there and watch it happen.

01:07:45.196 --> 01:07:48.529
We Like to watch cartoons.
You think he'd settle for that?

01:07:48.599 --> 01:07:52.057
...and she sees an identical twin.

01:07:52.136 --> 01:07:55.264
True, he didn't have his shirt on--
the other one did--

01:07:55.339 --> 01:07:57.807
but they sure look alike to me.

01:07:57.875 --> 01:08:01.367
If it got on his chest, even if it
didn't burn or got real cold--

01:08:01.445 --> 01:08:04.414
- I put my hand on the dry ice.
- Daddy's not here now.

01:08:04.482 --> 01:08:08.350
I wanted to take it off quickly
because it got very cold.

01:08:08.419 --> 01:08:11.320
I also confess, I was afraid
I might burn my hand.

01:08:11.389 --> 01:08:13.880
If I put it up
against a bare chest--

01:08:13.958 --> 01:08:16.051
Ken, work with me.
I'll take care of you--

01:08:18.863 --> 01:08:22.629
- You know that song?
- My judgment is for the defendant.

01:08:25.603 --> 01:08:28.037
We'll be back for the reaction...

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:30.595
to Judge Wapner's decision
right after these messages.

01:09:08.011 --> 01:09:10.845
- My credit card's been rejected?
- Yes, sir.

01:09:10.915 --> 01:09:13.383
Must be some accounting error.
How much will this cost?

01:09:13.451 --> 01:09:14.712
Twenty dollars, sir.

01:09:18.823 --> 01:09:20.346
Thank you.

01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:01.862
I'm never going back.
It's gonna be a Long time.

01:10:01.932 --> 01:10:04.867
- Definitely gonna be a Long journey.
- Just a couple of more days.

01:10:04.935 --> 01:10:07.904
You know the fella's name?
Then who's playing first?

01:10:07.972 --> 01:10:10.964
- The fella playing first for St. Louie?
- You gonna start with this again?

01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:13.908
It's just another motel.
You gotta do this every time?

01:10:13.978 --> 01:10:15.912
That's the man's name.
That's whose name.

01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:18.642
What are you asking me for?
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

01:10:18.716 --> 01:10:21.981
Who is on first.
I'm asking you, who's on first?

01:10:22.052 --> 01:10:24.020
- Yo, Ray.
- That's the man's name.

01:10:24.088 --> 01:10:27.285
- This is not a riddle.
- Yeah. Know the fella's name?

01:10:27.358 --> 01:10:30.486
-Yeah. Then who's playing first base?
-You'll never figure out who's on first.

01:10:30.561 --> 01:10:34.292
Who is on first.
That's the joke. It's comedy.

01:10:34.365 --> 01:10:36.356
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

01:10:36.433 --> 01:10:37.695
- Whose wife?
- It's comedy.

01:10:37.768 --> 01:10:39.827
Every dollar of it. Yeah.

01:10:39.904 --> 01:10:41.838
You got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

01:10:41.906 --> 01:10:43.840
It's a routine
between Abbott and Costello.

01:10:43.908 --> 01:10:46.968
When you do it, you're not funny.
You're Abbott and Abbott.

01:10:47.044 --> 01:10:48.443
- Yeah.
- You understand me?

01:10:48.512 --> 01:10:50.707
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

01:10:50.781 --> 01:10:52.043
Whose wife? Yeah.

01:10:52.116 --> 01:10:54.277
- Ray?
- Yeah.

01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:56.285
- You are never gonna solve it.
- Yeah.

01:10:56.353 --> 01:10:58.981
You know why?
It's not a riddle.

01:10:59.056 --> 01:11:00.990
And if you understood that...

01:11:01.058 --> 01:11:04.425
if you understood that it's funny,
you might get better.

01:11:04.495 --> 01:11:07.020
All I'm trying to find out
is what's the guy's name on first base.

01:11:07.097 --> 01:11:11.158
What's the guy's name on first base? No,
what's the guy's name on second base.

01:11:11.235 --> 01:11:13.169
Have you got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

01:11:13.237 --> 01:11:15.171
Then who's playing first?
Yeah.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.640
You know the fella's name?
Yeah.

01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:20.643
Then who's playing first?
Yeah.

01:11:20.711 --> 01:11:22.679
The fella playing first for St. Louie.
Who.

01:11:22.746 --> 01:11:24.714
The guy on first.
Who. The first baseman.

01:11:24.782 --> 01:11:26.647
Who is on first.
What are you asking me for?

01:11:26.717 --> 01:11:29.117
Have you got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

01:11:29.186 --> 01:11:31.120
All right, Ray. Come on.

01:11:31.188 --> 01:11:33.452
We're gonna put the bed
by the window...

01:11:33.524 --> 01:11:37.756
we got your apple juice, we'll put
the pens and paper on the table.

01:11:39.396 --> 01:11:41.330
- Did I forget something?
- The cheeseballs.

01:11:41.398 --> 01:11:43.866
- Yes.
- Definitely have cheeseballs.

01:11:43.934 --> 01:11:46.994
- I forgot the cheeseballs. We got 'em.
- I have to have 12 cheeseballs.

01:11:47.071 --> 01:11:49.437
- Yes, definitely.
- Get my tartar-control toothpaste.

01:11:49.506 --> 01:11:51.531
We got that for you
a couple of days ago.

01:11:51.609 --> 01:11:53.042
Where's my toothpaste?

01:11:55.112 --> 01:11:56.374
Raymond.

01:11:58.515 --> 01:12:01.609
Remember that doctor asked you
those number questions today?

01:12:01.685 --> 01:12:04.153
- Yeah.
- How did you do that?

01:12:04.221 --> 01:12:05.916
I see it.

01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:07.514
I see it.

01:12:07.591 --> 01:12:09.559
What's that?
Will you stop for a second?

01:12:09.627 --> 01:12:11.060
I see it.

01:12:11.128 --> 01:12:13.619
Put that down.
I'm trying to talk to you.

01:12:13.697 --> 01:12:15.961
When I say stop it,
why don't you stop it?

01:12:16.033 --> 01:12:19.002
Why do you always have to act
Like an idiot?

01:12:19.069 --> 01:12:21.435
- Yeah.
- You think that's funny?

01:12:21.505 --> 01:12:23.473
Yeah, funny Rain Man.
Funny teeth.

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.508
- What'd you say?
- Funny teeth.

01:12:25.576 --> 01:12:27.009
Rinse.

01:12:32.349 --> 01:12:35.750
Why'd you say--
Why'd you say funny teeth?

01:12:35.819 --> 01:12:37.787
You said funny teeth,
funny Rain Man.

01:12:39.156 --> 01:12:41.147
'Rain man'?
I said, 'Rain man'?

01:12:41.225 --> 01:12:43.159
Yeah, funny Rain Man.

01:12:46.563 --> 01:12:48.963
Was I trying to say 'Raymond'
and it came out 'rain man'?

01:12:49.033 --> 01:12:51.001
Yeah. Funny Rain Man.

01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:54.929
You? You're the rain man?

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:12.214
- Who took this picture?
- D-a-d.

01:13:13.857 --> 01:13:16.690
- You lived with us?
- Yeah, 10961 Beechcrest Street...

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:19.354
Cincinnati, Ohio.

01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:21.990
When did you Leave?

01:13:22.066 --> 01:13:24.000
January 21, 1965.

01:13:25.069 --> 01:13:27.560
- You remember then?
- It was Thursday. Very snowy out.

01:13:27.638 --> 01:13:30.300
7.2 inches. Snow that day.

01:13:32.209 --> 01:13:35.144
- Just after Mom died. New Year's.
- Yeah, Mom died.

01:13:35.212 --> 01:13:37.146
January 5, 1965.

01:13:37.214 --> 01:13:39.273
And you remember that day
that you left?

01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:42.410
- Short and sudden illness.
- You remember that day you left?

01:13:43.987 --> 01:13:46.012
Was I there? Where was l?

01:13:46.090 --> 01:13:49.116
You were in the window.
You waved to me.

01:13:49.193 --> 01:13:51.821
'Bye-bye, Rain Man.
Bye-bye, Rain Man.'

01:13:54.198 --> 01:13:55.130
So, you--

01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:58.598
- You were the one that sang to me?
- Yeah.

01:14:00.371 --> 01:14:04.307
What did you sing?
What was that song?

01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:08.444
What did you sing?

01:14:09.613 --> 01:14:13.014
She was just seventeen

01:14:13.083 --> 01:14:16.712
You know what I mean

01:14:16.787 --> 01:14:20.951
And the way she looked
was way beyond compare

01:14:22.226 --> 01:14:27.926
So how could I dance
with another

01:14:29.867 --> 01:14:34.327
When I saw her standing there

01:14:39.343 --> 01:14:41.277
Did I Like it
when you sang to me?

01:14:43.747 --> 01:14:47.114
Did we sing any other songs
Like the Beatles?

01:14:51.321 --> 01:14:53.585
Scary! Hot! Scary bad!

01:14:53.657 --> 01:14:56.524
Scary bad! Scary!

01:15:00.864 --> 01:15:03.458
What's scary about it?

01:15:03.534 --> 01:15:05.627
Hot water burn baby!

01:15:05.702 --> 01:15:09.001
- Water!
- 'Hot water burn baby'?

01:15:09.072 --> 01:15:11.233
- What baby? Me?
- Yeah.

01:15:11.308 --> 01:15:13.003
- Yeah.
- Easy, easy.

01:15:13.076 --> 01:15:16.534
- Water-- Hot water burn baby.
- I'm not burned.

01:15:16.613 --> 01:15:18.877
I'm not burned.
Look at me, please.

01:15:18.949 --> 01:15:21.008
- Water burn baby.
- Please. Please!

01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:23.985
Hot water burn--
Tub burn baby.

01:15:24.054 --> 01:15:26.488
- I'm not burned.
- Tub burn baby.

01:15:26.557 --> 01:15:28.491
- I'm not burned.
- Yeah.

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.524
I'm not burned. It's okay.

01:15:34.631 --> 01:15:37.065
It's okay.

01:15:43.874 --> 01:15:46.138
Time for Wallbrook now.

01:15:46.210 --> 01:15:48.610
That's why they put you away.

01:15:48.679 --> 01:15:50.613
They thought you'd hurt me.

01:15:53.250 --> 01:15:55.411
Never hurt baby.

01:15:55.486 --> 01:15:57.920
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

01:15:57.988 --> 01:16:00.889
Never hurt Charlie.

01:16:00.958 --> 01:16:02.892
What? What?

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:06.327
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

01:16:07.231 --> 01:16:08.289
What, Ray?

01:16:12.269 --> 01:16:13.531
What?

01:16:18.108 --> 01:16:20.042
Come on. It's 11:00, Ray.

01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:22.044
- Lights out.
- Yeah.

01:16:31.321 --> 01:16:34.950
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

01:16:42.132 --> 01:16:45.067
There you go. Right where you Like 'em,
at the end of the bed.

01:16:57.114 --> 01:16:58.376
Come on, Ray.

01:17:46.129 --> 01:17:48.063
Hi, it's me.

01:17:48.131 --> 01:17:50.292
You didn't hang up.
Does that mean we're engaged?

01:17:51.401 --> 01:17:52.993
Listen, l, uh--

01:17:55.339 --> 01:17:57.273
I just wanna hear it's not over.

01:17:59.276 --> 01:18:01.301
I'm scared it's over.

01:18:01.378 --> 01:18:04.313
Don't ask me tonight.
I don't know what to say.

01:18:04.381 --> 01:18:07.782
- Let it sit.
- Something I'm not real good at.

01:18:07.851 --> 01:18:10.786
There are a lot of things
that you're not good at.

01:18:10.854 --> 01:18:12.788
I'll call you
when I get back, okay?

01:18:16.827 --> 01:18:18.761
- I'll see you.
- Ciao.

01:19:45.964 --> 01:19:50.367
Why are you looking at that? I bought
a TV, and you're watching a dryer.

01:19:50.436 --> 01:19:52.233
I don't know.

01:19:52.304 --> 01:19:54.397
Because at the shrink hearing,
we'll have to prove...

01:19:54.473 --> 01:19:58.239
you prefer to watch TV as opposed to
the clothes dryer, you understand that?

01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:59.902
- Yeah.
- You Listening to me?

01:20:01.447 --> 01:20:03.438
Turn this off
when you're not watching it.

01:20:03.515 --> 01:20:05.540
- Yeah.
- You'll run down the batteries.

01:20:05.617 --> 01:20:07.881
Then where will you be
at 3:00 when Wapner's on?

01:20:07.953 --> 01:20:10.353
Yeah. The red one
always falls the same.

01:20:10.422 --> 01:20:12.583
Why don't you listen to me?

01:20:12.658 --> 01:20:14.592
You don't wanna
listen to me, do you?

01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:16.594
You wanna go back to Wallbrook?

01:20:16.662 --> 01:20:19.495
I gotta make
a phone call.

01:20:30.275 --> 01:20:31.765
Lenny, it's me.

01:20:31.844 --> 01:20:34.779
Where have you been? I've been
sittin' by this phone for three hours.

01:20:34.847 --> 01:20:36.781
I had to buy some clothes.

01:20:36.849 --> 01:20:39.784
Clothes? Charlie, we are
in serious trouble.

01:20:39.852 --> 01:20:42.082
- Why are you buyin' clothes?
- Take it easy.

01:20:42.154 --> 01:20:44.088
I'm in Tucumcari.
I'll be there--

01:20:44.156 --> 01:20:46.920
They repossessed the cars
to pay off the Loan.

01:20:46.992 --> 01:20:49.654
The cars are gone, Charlie.

01:20:49.728 --> 01:20:52.595
And Bateman wants
his down payment back. They all do.

01:20:52.664 --> 01:20:54.529
That's 80,000, Charlie.

01:20:55.434 --> 01:20:58.369
80,000. I don't have it.

01:20:58.437 --> 01:21:01.463
You gotta pay these people back,
or it's all over.

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:04.873
We're out of business.
What am I gonna tell 'em?

01:21:04.943 --> 01:21:06.069
I don't know.

01:21:23.195 --> 01:21:25.789
Son of a bitch!

01:21:25.864 --> 01:21:28.594
Son of a bitch!

01:22:02.801 --> 01:22:05.895
This would be easier
if you let me put the top up.

01:22:05.971 --> 01:22:07.905
You wouldn't have to fry.

01:22:07.973 --> 01:22:10.373
Put this lotion on
so you don't burn.

01:22:10.442 --> 01:22:13.434
Don't start with that.
You want me to put the top up?

01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:17.107
- I definitely Like the top down.
- I know. I don't want you to burn.

01:22:17.182 --> 01:22:20.481
Definitely Like it
when the top's--

01:22:20.552 --> 01:22:22.884
It's all right.
Just take it easy.

01:22:22.955 --> 01:22:25.048
- Oh, no.
- It's almost over.

01:22:25.123 --> 01:22:27.387
Uh-huh. All right.
How does that feel?

01:22:27.459 --> 01:22:28.983
Very slippery.

01:22:38.804 --> 01:22:43.605
Maldonado swings, and there's
a base hit into center field.

01:22:44.943 --> 01:22:46.274
One run is in.
Here's Brenly going to third.

01:22:46.345 --> 01:22:48.779
The throw by Davis... not in time.

01:22:50.282 --> 01:22:52.682
Brenly in safely
at third base...

01:22:52.751 --> 01:22:54.685
on Maldonado's single.

01:22:54.753 --> 01:22:58.416
He held that ball too Long
in center field, don't you think so?

01:22:58.490 --> 01:23:00.481
We'll look at it again.

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:05.690
Treadwell playing way over towards
the right side, shaded him to pull.

01:23:07.332 --> 01:23:08.264
Here's Davis.

01:23:10.235 --> 01:23:13.534
Yeah, he seems to hold it there
just a bit, Tom.

01:23:13.605 --> 01:23:16.369
Sort of double-pumped it.
Watch the replay.

01:23:16.441 --> 01:23:19.433
He loses all chance
on a play on Brenly...

01:23:19.511 --> 01:23:22.537
even though Brenly
doesn't exactly run fast.

01:23:23.849 --> 01:23:27.945
And the throw into third base
finally is a little bit high.

01:24:00.018 --> 01:24:01.952
Will you give me
a break with this?

01:24:06.058 --> 01:24:07.320
Ray, stop it.

01:24:22.708 --> 01:24:24.039
J-7.

01:24:25.944 --> 01:24:27.878
- K-7? What's that?
- J-7.

01:24:30.082 --> 01:24:31.344
What's J-7?

01:24:33.552 --> 01:24:35.611
What's J-7? The song?

01:24:45.063 --> 01:24:48.499
Look out there, Raymond.
No, out here.

01:24:51.203 --> 01:24:53.103

01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:55.696

01:24:59.578 --> 01:25:02.046

'Course, that's Hank Williams, Jr.

01:25:05.550 --> 01:25:07.484
D-1. D-1.

01:25:11.123 --> 01:25:13.057
'Blue Moon of Kentucky,'
Bill Monroe.

01:25:13.125 --> 01:25:15.059
And the Bluegrass Boys. K-5.

01:25:18.263 --> 01:25:20.254
How many toothpicks
came out of that box?

01:25:20.332 --> 01:25:21.629
246.

01:25:23.268 --> 01:25:25.236
- Yeah.
- 246.

01:25:26.605 --> 01:25:28.630
- Are you paying attention?
- Yeah.

01:25:34.112 --> 01:25:36.080
- You watching that?
- Yeah.

01:25:40.118 --> 01:25:43.053
- You seeing that, Ray?
- Yeah. Falling on the ground.

01:25:46.124 --> 01:25:50.083
Okay. Now what do I have left?

01:25:50.162 --> 01:25:52.357
Two jacks, one 8,
one king, one 6...

01:25:52.431 --> 01:25:56.197
two aces, one 10, one 9, one 5.

01:25:56.268 --> 01:25:58.202
One 5.

01:25:58.270 --> 01:26:00.238
You are beautiful, man.

01:26:23.428 --> 01:26:25.362
- I'm an excellent driver.
- You can't drive now, Ray.

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:27.660
You Listening to me?
This is very important.

01:26:27.732 --> 01:26:31.224
When there's lots of tens and picture
cards left, then it's good for us.

01:26:31.303 --> 01:26:33.771
- Say it. 'Tens are good.'
- Tens are good.

01:26:33.839 --> 01:26:36.808
- Okay. And you're gonna bet one--
- One if it's bad.

01:26:36.875 --> 01:26:40.140
- Two if it's good.
- That's right. Two if it's good.

01:26:40.212 --> 01:26:42.442
Now, listen.
Casinos have house rules.

01:26:44.182 --> 01:26:46.116
The first one is,
they don't Like to lose.

01:26:47.686 --> 01:26:50.484
So you never, never show
that you are counting cards.

01:26:50.555 --> 01:26:52.819
That is the cardinal sin, Ray.

01:26:52.891 --> 01:26:55.519
Are you Listening to me?
That's very, very important.

01:26:55.594 --> 01:26:58.461
Yeah. Counting is bad.

01:26:58.530 --> 01:27:00.122
Yes. Counting is bad.

01:27:01.032 --> 01:27:02.966
I Like to drive
slow on the driveway.

01:27:03.034 --> 01:27:07.266
You get this right, you can drive
wherever you want as slow as you Like.

01:27:07.339 --> 01:27:09.500
I'm an excellent driver.

01:27:41.306 --> 01:27:44.707
Miss Sue Morgan, please pick up
the hotel courtesy phone.

01:29:31.249 --> 01:29:32.716

I'm goin' for it, Nick.

01:30:29.943 --> 01:30:32.935
It certainly looks Like it.

01:30:49.029 --> 01:30:51.896
- You wanna bet one chip or two chips?
- Bet two.

01:30:52.666 --> 01:30:53.758
Bet two?

01:31:40.581 --> 01:31:42.071
What's your secret, guys?

01:31:43.150 --> 01:31:45.482
We cheat.

01:31:45.552 --> 01:31:49.147
This is Sam.

01:32:20.287 --> 01:32:21.720
What do you see?

He's not catching the hole card,
and he's not past posting us.

01:32:25.259 --> 01:32:28.956
- He's not using a computer.
- No, but something's not right.

01:32:29.029 --> 01:32:31.554
No one can count
into a six-deck shoe.

01:33:05.766 --> 01:33:07.028
Hold it here.

01:33:09.336 --> 01:33:12.237

Little black-- No? Easy, easy.

Don't start banging yourself.

01:34:04.458 --> 01:34:07.086

01:34:33.086 --> 01:34:36.419
We don't have to pay for a room.
That's comped. I'm free and clear.

01:34:36.490 --> 01:34:38.549
I'm gonna take a celebration piss.

01:34:41.361 --> 01:34:44.524
Don't go anywhere. Until I get back,
the sign says, 'Don't walk.'

01:34:44.598 --> 01:34:46.589
- Don't walk.
- Don't walk.

01:35:08.488 --> 01:35:11.116

01:36:14.488 --> 01:36:16.786
We're counting cards.

01:36:16.857 --> 01:36:19.018
We're counting cards.

01:36:19.092 --> 01:36:21.185
What else do you do?

01:36:21.261 --> 01:36:23.195
We're counting cards.

01:36:23.263 --> 01:36:25.424
I know that.
What else do you do?

01:36:25.499 --> 01:36:27.490
Are you taking
any prescription medication?

01:36:27.567 --> 01:36:30.468

01:36:36.109 --> 01:36:38.304
I have to be in bed by 11:00.
Lights out at 11:00.

01:36:38.378 --> 01:36:41.905
10:00, daylight saving time.

01:36:41.982 --> 01:36:43.779

I've never seen you in a suit.
He did a great job.

01:36:55.829 --> 01:36:58.354
You don't realize how good you look.
Do you Like it?

01:36:58.432 --> 01:37:00.366
It's not Kmart.

01:37:00.434 --> 01:37:04.495
How could you not Like that suit?
You look fantastic, Ray?

01:37:04.571 --> 01:37:07.836

01:37:07.908 --> 01:37:10.308

- Right by the window.
- Go on up.

01:37:34.801 --> 01:37:37.736
- Just the way you Like it, isn't it?
- Yeah.

01:37:39.206 --> 01:37:41.538
Look at you with all
those lights, Ray.

01:37:41.608 --> 01:37:44.076
You are Mr. Las Vegas now.

01:37:44.144 --> 01:37:46.112
What do you think?

01:37:46.179 --> 01:37:49.410
There's a lot of lights out there.
It's very sparkly. Very twinkly.

01:37:50.317 --> 01:37:53.718
We made a lot of money today.

01:37:53.787 --> 01:37:57.951
Forgetting the $3,000 that we
tossed away at that wheel of fortune.

01:37:58.024 --> 01:38:00.015
Yeah, 'Wheel Of Fortune.'

01:38:00.093 --> 01:38:03.392
And I'm sorry about that.
I got a little carried away.

01:38:03.463 --> 01:38:07.194
I got a little hot, Ray.

01:38:07.267 --> 01:38:11.533
I'm sayin' that I'm sorry, and I just
want you to know that I am sorry.

01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:17.843
I'm apologizing. I got
a little carried away. The money.

01:38:17.911 --> 01:38:22.041
I got a little greedy.
Wanna say somethin'?

01:38:22.115 --> 01:38:24.709
I have to be at the bar
at 10:00 with Iris.

01:38:24.785 --> 01:38:27.015
I gotta thank you, man.

01:38:28.989 --> 01:38:30.923
You did it.

01:38:30.991 --> 01:38:34.119
I was just there.
You saved my ass.

01:38:34.194 --> 01:38:36.983
I'm just along for the ride.

01:38:37.050 --> 01:38:41.077
Be at the bar at 10:00.
Have to go to a date with Iris.

01:38:41.154 --> 01:38:43.281
Iris, that's her name.

01:38:43.356 --> 01:38:45.221
Big date. Gonna go dancing.

01:38:45.292 --> 01:38:48.159
I have to go to a date
with Iris at the bar.

01:38:48.228 --> 01:38:50.287
- Know how to dance?
- I don't know.

01:38:50.363 --> 01:38:52.854
You ought to learn sometime.

01:38:52.933 --> 01:38:55.595
Yeah, have to learn
to dance with a date.

01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:58.934
- I have to learn to dance with a date.
- I was just kidding.

01:38:59.005 --> 01:39:01.235
You're not gonna have to
dance on this date.

01:39:01.308 --> 01:39:05.039
I have to go to the date,
learn to dance. Definitely. Now.

01:39:05.112 --> 01:39:07.137
You don't have to dance now...

01:39:07.214 --> 01:39:09.876
but I'll teach you
how to dance sometime.

01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:13.477
- You won't have to dance on this.
- Have to learn how to dance now.

01:39:13.553 --> 01:39:17.819
I'm sorry I brought this up.
All right, Ray, my mistake.

01:39:17.891 --> 01:39:20.826
You got the only
famous dancing hooker in Vegas.

01:39:20.894 --> 01:39:22.327
Stand over there.

01:39:30.804 --> 01:39:33.170
- Come over here.
- Yeah.

01:39:34.274 --> 01:39:37.607
You hear the music?
Just watch my feet.

01:39:37.677 --> 01:39:40.145
Raymond, watch my feet.

01:39:40.213 --> 01:39:43.239
Just do what I'm doin'. Okay?

01:39:43.316 --> 01:39:47.252
You feel the rhythm of the music?
We're just movin' our feet.

01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:50.653
You're the guy,
so you're gonna have to lead.

01:39:50.724 --> 01:39:53.249
I'm the date, so you want to--

01:39:55.362 --> 01:39:58.695
You wanna put your
left hand up Like this.

01:39:58.765 --> 01:40:02.223
Raymond, don't stop movin'.
Payin' attention?

01:40:02.302 --> 01:40:06.204
Put your left hand up Like this.
Left hand. That's good.

01:40:06.273 --> 01:40:09.504
Don't stop movin'.
Good. Just Like that.

01:40:09.576 --> 01:40:12.010
Take this other hand,
put it behind my back.

01:40:12.078 --> 01:40:15.104
- Ray, you wanna learn how to dance?
- Yeah.

01:40:15.182 --> 01:40:18.481
You gotta touch someone when you dance.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:40:18.552 --> 01:40:21.885
All right?
Just put it right there.

01:40:21.955 --> 01:40:24.446
I take my hand,
I put it up here.

01:40:24.524 --> 01:40:26.617
Watch my feet, Ray.

01:40:26.693 --> 01:40:30.754
The rhythm, the rhythm.
All right?

01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:34.994
You can't watch my feet the whole time,
so you're gonna have to look up.

01:40:35.068 --> 01:40:38.731
Now when I tell you to,
I want you to just look up...

01:40:38.805 --> 01:40:41.330
real slow, just keep movin'.

01:40:41.408 --> 01:40:43.342
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:40:43.410 --> 01:40:45.640
- Start lookin' up.
- Yeah.

01:40:45.712 --> 01:40:47.976
A little more.
Keep movin'.

01:40:48.048 --> 01:40:50.676
- Just a little more.
- Yeah.

01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:52.877
A little more, Ray.

01:40:52.953 --> 01:40:55.046
All the way up.

01:40:57.090 --> 01:40:59.991
There you go, Ray.
You're dancin'.

01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:04.360
- Yeah, dancin'.
- You wanna close your hand here.

01:41:04.431 --> 01:41:08.094
You wanna put it Like that.
You're gonna turn me Like this.

01:41:09.169 --> 01:41:11.797
Just turn me.
That's good.

01:41:11.871 --> 01:41:14.339
- This is dancin'.
- This is dancing.

01:41:14.407 --> 01:41:17.843
I don't know about you,
but I'm startin' to feel a little silly.

01:41:51.077 --> 01:41:53.739
- That's it.
- Yeah.

01:41:53.813 --> 01:41:55.075
All right!

01:41:55.181 --> 01:41:57.149
You are a good dancer.

01:41:57.217 --> 01:41:59.777
- You wanna give me a hug?
- Yeah.

01:42:11.898 --> 01:42:14.992
I just wanted to
give you a hug, Ray.

01:42:16.369 --> 01:42:19.736
I just felt Like givin' you a hug.

01:42:34.888 --> 01:42:36.321
What are you doin' here?

01:42:36.389 --> 01:42:39.790
- I'm unemployed.
- What do you mean?

01:42:39.859 --> 01:42:43.727
- You don't know about the business?
- Yeah, I know. Come on in.

01:42:45.965 --> 01:42:48.991
I'm glad to see you.

01:42:49.069 --> 01:42:50.661
Ray, look who's here.

01:43:15.428 --> 01:43:18.761
It's not right,
what you're doing to Raymond.

01:43:18.832 --> 01:43:21.357
- He's fine.
- I know he's fine.

01:43:21.434 --> 01:43:26.133
He's in Las Vegas in a suit
in a big room. It makes me sad.

01:43:26.206 --> 01:43:28.333
Six minutes to my date.

01:43:28.408 --> 01:43:31.104
Six minutes to Iris.

01:43:31.177 --> 01:43:32.610
He has a date?

01:43:34.214 --> 01:43:38.207
Raymond, it'd be nice if you didn't
carry that television everywhere we go.

01:43:38.284 --> 01:43:40.878
Why do you have to bring
a Watchman on your date?

01:43:40.954 --> 01:43:42.888
A man's dancing.

01:43:42.956 --> 01:43:46.221
But what does your date
look Like, Raymond?

01:43:46.292 --> 01:43:49.056
She's very sparkly.
She looks Like a holiday.

01:43:51.164 --> 01:43:54.065
- I haven't heard that one before.
- Mr. Babbitt?

01:43:54.134 --> 01:43:57.331
- Mr. Kelso would Like to see you.
- I don't know Mr. Kelso.

01:43:57.404 --> 01:44:00.965
He's director of security.
Would you come with me, please?

01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:03.372
Sure. Susanna,
you stay with Raymond.

01:44:03.443 --> 01:44:05.877
- Right this way.
- Certainly.

01:44:21.094 --> 01:44:23.085
10:01, she's not here.

01:44:23.163 --> 01:44:25.461
She'll come. She will.

01:44:34.774 --> 01:44:38.801
Congratulations, Mr. Babbitt.
Counting into a six-deck shoe is a feat.

01:44:38.878 --> 01:44:41.745
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

01:44:41.815 --> 01:44:44.978
We make videotapes, Mr. Babbitt,
and we analyze the tapes...

01:44:45.051 --> 01:44:48.418
and we even share some of the
information with the other casinos.

01:44:48.488 --> 01:44:52.083
These tapes suggest that you should
take your winnings and Leave the state.

01:44:52.158 --> 01:44:54.626
Someone has a good day
at the tables...

01:44:54.694 --> 01:44:57.288
and you accuse them
of illegal activities?

01:44:57.363 --> 01:44:59.558
Is this how you treat
all your guests?

01:44:59.632 --> 01:45:01.896
All you have to do is
close your mouth and go home.

01:45:01.968 --> 01:45:06.701
Those are the best odds you're
gonna see for a while. I'd take 'em.

01:45:15.849 --> 01:45:18.784
- Did you want to dance on your date?
- Yeah.

01:45:18.852 --> 01:45:23.084
There'll be other chances. Many pretty
girls would love to dance with you.

01:45:23.156 --> 01:45:25.590
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be okay.

01:45:43.343 --> 01:45:46.244
- I Like this music, Ray.
- Elevator stopped.

01:45:46.312 --> 01:45:50.612
It's okay. You think you could show me
how you were going to dance with Iris?

01:45:50.683 --> 01:45:52.548
- Yeah.
- Yes?

01:45:52.619 --> 01:45:55.884
- Would you Like to dance with me?
- Elevator's on hold.

01:45:55.955 --> 01:45:58.355
- Give me this.
- Yeah.

01:46:00.894 --> 01:46:03.454
- Yeah.
- Show me how.

01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:05.623
Charlie Babbitt taught me.

01:46:05.698 --> 01:46:08.132
- Charlie Babbitt?
- Yeah.

01:46:08.968 --> 01:46:12.028
Dancing in the elevator.

01:46:12.105 --> 01:46:13.868
It's nice.

01:46:16.476 --> 01:46:17.909
You're very good.

01:46:31.457 --> 01:46:35.188
- Iris missed a beautiful dance.
- Yeah.

01:46:36.429 --> 01:46:39.193
- And a kiss.
- Yeah, a kiss.

01:46:39.265 --> 01:46:42.359
- Have you ever kissed a girl?
- I don't know.

01:46:43.603 --> 01:46:45.867
You don't know?

01:46:47.206 --> 01:46:50.175
Open your mouth. Open.

01:46:50.243 --> 01:46:52.643
- Yeah.
- Like this.

01:46:52.712 --> 01:46:56.478
Like you were tasting
something very good...

01:46:56.549 --> 01:46:59.017
and very soft.

01:47:02.155 --> 01:47:05.318
Like this.
Close your eyes.

01:47:12.131 --> 01:47:14.565
- It's okay, Ray.
- Yeah.

01:47:22.842 --> 01:47:25.333
- How was that?
- Wet.

01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:30.149
- Then we did it right.
- Elevator's definitely stuck.

01:47:30.216 --> 01:47:31.706
No, it's not stuck.

01:47:36.289 --> 01:47:37.415
Here.

01:47:39.492 --> 01:47:42.290
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.

01:47:43.563 --> 01:47:45.893
- Like us.
- Yeah, Like us.

01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:49.987
What'd I tell you, Ray?
I promised you could drive.

01:47:50.064 --> 01:47:53.795
- At Wallbrook, I drive on the driveway.
- Charlie, this is okay?

01:47:53.868 --> 01:47:56.302
- I'm an excellent driver.
- He's good on a driveway.

01:48:55.063 --> 01:48:57.327
Ray, why don't you
get in the front seat?

01:48:58.933 --> 01:49:01.401
So, I'll wait to hear from you
after Raymond's meeting?

01:49:01.469 --> 01:49:04.131
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be fine.

01:49:04.205 --> 01:49:06.605
- Yeah. I'm nervous.
- I know.

01:49:06.674 --> 01:49:10.508
Listen, I'm glad, happy--
I'm happy that you came to Vegas.

01:49:10.578 --> 01:49:13.172
I know.

01:49:14.182 --> 01:49:15.615
Ciao.

01:49:17.118 --> 01:49:21.054
Ray, thank you for the date
in the elevator. It was really nice.

01:49:21.122 --> 01:49:23.056
- Yeah.
- Ciao.

01:49:23.124 --> 01:49:26.321
- Thank you for the what?
- It's something between us.

01:49:26.394 --> 01:49:28.760
- Between us?
- Us.

01:49:32.333 --> 01:49:34.096
Us, Ray?

01:49:39.474 --> 01:49:42.443
Here we go, Ray.
This is your bedroom up here.

01:49:42.510 --> 01:49:45.138
Of course, there's
definitely no bed there.

01:49:45.213 --> 01:49:49.343
No, this is a magic bed, Ray.
You just watch and see.

01:49:49.417 --> 01:49:53.444
We got the table over here.
We got the television, Ray.

01:49:53.521 --> 01:49:56.456
Went to the video store.
Got a surprise for you, Ray.

01:49:56.524 --> 01:49:59.186
Picked up a video for you.

01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:02.388
Don't start with that, Ray.

01:50:02.463 --> 01:50:06.126
It's not just another place, Ray.
This is my place.

01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:08.862
I'm asking you who's on first.
That's the man's name.

01:50:08.936 --> 01:50:11.427
Who? The first baseman.
Who is on first.

01:50:11.506 --> 01:50:14.998
You got a first baseman on first?
Certainly. Then who's playing first?

01:50:18.613 --> 01:50:21.047
- The man's entitled to it.
- Who is?

01:50:21.115 --> 01:50:23.208
Yes.

01:50:23.284 --> 01:50:25.218
- So who gets it?
- Why shouldn't he?

01:50:25.286 --> 01:50:27.220
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.

01:50:27.288 --> 01:50:29.882
- Whose wife?
- Yes.

01:50:29.957 --> 01:50:31.891
- After all, the man earns it.
- Who does?

01:50:31.959 --> 01:50:33.654
Absolutely.

01:50:33.728 --> 01:50:36.128
All I'm tryin' to find out is
what's the guy's name on first base?

01:50:36.197 --> 01:50:38.392
No, What is on second base.

01:50:38.466 --> 01:50:42.061
- Don't you think this is funny?
- Yes, it's funny.

01:50:44.071 --> 01:50:47.302
- Where'd you see this first?
- Dad gave me a book on baseball trivia.

01:50:47.375 --> 01:50:49.536
- Dad, huh?
- Yeah.

01:50:49.610 --> 01:50:52.545
- Guess it didn't read as funny.
- Definitely not.

01:50:54.081 --> 01:50:57.778
Hello, this is Dr. Bruner.
I'd Like you to call me.

01:50:57.852 --> 01:50:59.376
Yeah, what is it?

01:50:59.453 --> 01:51:02.718
I thought I got the machine.

01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:06.521
I just got into town, and the
psychological interview is tomorrow.

01:51:06.594 --> 01:51:08.619
Yes, sir, I know that.

01:51:08.696 --> 01:51:11.028
I thought we should
get together and talk.

01:51:11.098 --> 01:51:15.057
I think it might be in your
best interests to meet me.

01:51:15.136 --> 01:51:16.398
When?

01:51:16.470 --> 01:51:19.633
I'm at the Bonaventure.
How about tonight at 8:30?

01:51:42.029 --> 01:51:45.988
Tomorrow you'll meet Dr. Marston,
who's in charge of Raymond's evaluation.

01:51:46.067 --> 01:51:49.559
- Yeah, I know.
- I gave him boxes of files on Raymond.

01:51:49.637 --> 01:51:52.435
- Good luck.
- This isn't a close call.

01:51:52.506 --> 01:51:55.407
It's a formality. Your brother's
a very disabled individual.

01:51:55.476 --> 01:51:58.343
Are you trying to tell me that
Marston's gonna rule against me?

01:51:58.412 --> 01:52:01.472
No, I'm telling you
it's always been a lost cause.

01:52:01.549 --> 01:52:04.313
- Then why did you call me?
- Let me tell you something.

01:52:04.385 --> 01:52:07.047
Your father put me in charge
of all the money.

01:52:07.121 --> 01:52:09.988
It doesn't matter whether or not
you win custody of Raymond.

01:52:10.057 --> 01:52:13.356
I won't have to pay you a dime.
It's at my discretion.

01:52:13.427 --> 01:52:17.625
- So you can't lose?
- I can lose Raymond.

01:52:17.698 --> 01:52:20.496
I care about your brother's Life
and the treatment he receives.

01:52:20.568 --> 01:52:23.833
I made a commitment to your father
some 20 years ago...

01:52:23.904 --> 01:52:26.236
and I'm not willing
to gamble with that.

01:52:26.307 --> 01:52:28.172
What is this?

01:52:28.242 --> 01:52:29.834
It's a very big check.

01:52:33.447 --> 01:52:35.108
$250,000.

01:52:35.182 --> 01:52:38.583
And no strings attached.
Just walk away, Charlie.

01:52:39.854 --> 01:52:42.288
This isn't about you and me.

01:52:42.356 --> 01:52:44.517
It's not about winning or losing.

01:52:46.861 --> 01:52:50.695
I asked you a week ago, why didn't
anyone ever tell me I had a brother?

01:52:50.765 --> 01:52:52.824
You didn't have an answer.

01:52:53.901 --> 01:52:56.028
I don't know.

01:52:57.438 --> 01:52:59.702
I just realized
I'm not pissed off anymore...

01:52:59.774 --> 01:53:02.140
my father cut me out of his will.

01:53:03.711 --> 01:53:07.374
You probably knew he tried
to contact me over the years.

01:53:07.448 --> 01:53:10.008
I never called him back.
I was a prick.

01:53:10.084 --> 01:53:13.918
If he was my son and didn't return
my calls, I'd have written him out.

01:53:13.988 --> 01:53:16.582
But it's not about
the money anymore.

01:53:17.825 --> 01:53:20.851
You know,
I just don't understand.

01:53:20.928 --> 01:53:23.954
Why didn't he tell me
I had a brother?

01:53:24.031 --> 01:53:27.694
Why didn't anyone ever tell me
that I had a brother?

01:53:31.238 --> 01:53:35.402
Because it'd have been nice to know him
for more than just the past six days.

01:55:20.214 --> 01:55:22.808
Ray! Come on.

01:55:22.883 --> 01:55:25.852
It stopped.
It's all right.

01:55:32.626 --> 01:55:34.617
V-E-R-N.

01:55:34.695 --> 01:55:36.959
Vern. Vern.

01:55:37.031 --> 01:55:39.898
My main man, Vern.

01:55:39.967 --> 01:55:42.401
V-E-R-N.

01:55:49.243 --> 01:55:51.507
My main man, Vern.

01:55:54.181 --> 01:55:57.536
V-E-R-N.
Vern, my main man.

01:55:57.603 --> 01:56:00.197
They got raspberry, blueberry...

01:56:00.272 --> 01:56:02.968
whole wheat, peachy keen,
beer nut, rocky road, buckwheat.

01:56:03.042 --> 01:56:06.341
How about buckwheat?
What kind of pancakes you want, Ray?

01:56:06.412 --> 01:56:08.277
- Pancakes.
- What kind?

01:56:08.347 --> 01:56:10.144
- Pancakes.
- Of course.

01:56:10.216 --> 01:56:13.049
The maple syrup is supposed to be
on the table before the pan--

01:56:17.189 --> 01:56:19.783
Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

01:56:19.859 --> 01:56:22.293
- I made a joke, Ray.
- Yeah.

01:56:42.014 --> 01:56:43.948
Step back a little bit.

01:57:04.236 --> 01:57:05.669
Hello?

01:57:06.739 --> 01:57:09.503
Why don't you go
sit down over there?

01:57:13.179 --> 01:57:14.612
Hello?

01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:18.480
This is not a legal proceeding,
so there's no judge present...

01:57:18.551 --> 01:57:21.384
just the people
who care about Raymond.

01:57:21.454 --> 01:57:25.322
Raymond, have a seat over there.
Mr. Babbitt, other side of the table.

01:57:25.391 --> 01:57:27.951
Raymond, right here.
How about this seat?

01:57:28.027 --> 01:57:31.394
- Take this seat.
- Put your knapsack on the floor.

01:57:31.464 --> 01:57:34.729
This is a good opportunity
to be honest with one another.

01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:39.032
Ray, the TV?
On the floor. I'm sorry.

01:57:39.105 --> 01:57:42.404
I don't know an easy way
to say this, Mr. Babbitt--

01:57:42.475 --> 01:57:44.409
Have I lost already?

01:57:44.477 --> 01:57:46.945
No, you haven't lost.
I'm not the judge and jury.

01:57:47.012 --> 01:57:49.207
I'm just making
a recommendation to a court.

01:57:49.281 --> 01:57:52.944
I must tell you that Dr. Bruner
is a very respected professional.

01:57:53.018 --> 01:57:56.010
Raymond's case has been meticulously
documented over the years...

01:57:56.088 --> 01:57:59.057
and Wallbrook is one of the
finest institutions in this country.

01:57:59.125 --> 01:58:01.559
You've made up your mind.
I'll see you in court.

01:58:01.627 --> 01:58:05.154
My brother came further with me
than he did with you in 20 years.

01:58:05.231 --> 01:58:07.722
- It's not necessary to--
- You don't know anything about us.

01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:11.327
- It's not necessary to challenge him.
- I'm sorry.

01:58:11.403 --> 01:58:13.667
Exactly what happened
this past week, Raymond?

01:58:13.739 --> 01:58:16.469
- We got to know each other.
- I was asking Raymond.

01:58:16.542 --> 01:58:19.739
Raymond, what happened
this past week?

01:58:19.812 --> 01:58:21.803
- What did you do?
- Counted cards.

01:58:21.881 --> 01:58:23.974
- Counted cards?
- Counted cards in Las Vegas.

01:58:24.049 --> 01:58:27.951
- Your brother took you to Las Vegas?
- Lost $3,000 on the wheel of fortune.

01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:29.954
Gave you $3,000 to gamble with?

01:58:30.022 --> 01:58:33.185
Lost $3,000 on pitiful 20.

01:58:33.259 --> 01:58:35.625
- And what else did you do?
- Bet on number 20.

01:58:35.694 --> 01:58:38.788
- What else did you do?
- Danced with Charlie Babbitt.

01:58:38.864 --> 01:58:40.855
- Danced with your brother?
- He wanted to learn.

01:58:40.933 --> 01:58:43.766
Danced in the elevator with Susanna.
Kissed Susanna.

01:58:43.836 --> 01:58:46.100
- You kissed Susanna?
- Yeah, in the elevator.

01:58:46.172 --> 01:58:49.232
- Did you enjoy kissing a woman?
- I don't know.

01:58:49.308 --> 01:58:51.572
- How did it feel?
- It felt wet.

01:58:51.644 --> 01:58:53.111
- Wet?
- Yeah.

01:58:53.179 --> 01:58:55.909
- Quite a trip, huh?
- Yeah.

01:58:55.981 --> 01:58:59.041
- Did you enjoy being on the road?
- I'm an excellent driver.

01:58:59.118 --> 01:59:01.211
- You drove?
- Yeah.

01:59:01.287 --> 01:59:04.779
-Your brother let you drive the highway?
-Slow on the driveway.

01:59:04.857 --> 01:59:08.190
He didn't drive on the highway.

01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:10.922
- Did he have any emotional outbursts?
- What do you mean?

01:59:10.996 --> 01:59:15.262
Well, things they tend to do when--
Inflict bodily harm on themselves.

01:59:15.334 --> 01:59:17.825
- Yeah, a couple of times.
- A couple of times?

01:59:17.903 --> 01:59:21.498
He had what you call an outburst at
the airport because he didn't wanna fly.

01:59:21.574 --> 01:59:24.441
- So we didn't fly.
- When was his last outburst?

01:59:24.510 --> 01:59:26.740
- This morning when--
- This morning?

01:59:26.812 --> 01:59:30.407
This is bullshit, because I could
tell you anything or tell you nothing.

01:59:30.482 --> 01:59:33.747
You'd never know the difference.
This morning the smoke alarm went off.

01:59:33.819 --> 01:59:35.753
He got nervous,
but he's fine now.

01:59:35.821 --> 01:59:38.153
Don't feel as I'm
placing any blame.

01:59:38.224 --> 01:59:40.818
We went out for pancakes.
He's fine.

01:59:40.893 --> 01:59:44.260
- You don't have to be defensive.
- I'm just being honest with you.

01:59:44.330 --> 01:59:47.163
- You're missing the point.
- I'm being truthful about this.

01:59:47.233 --> 01:59:49.201
I'm not placing any blame--

01:59:49.268 --> 01:59:52.362
I had a father I hardly knew,
a mother I didn't know at all.

01:59:52.438 --> 01:59:56.169
I find out now that I have a brother,
and I'm supposed to give him up?

01:59:56.242 --> 01:59:58.176
No one is saying anything.

01:59:58.244 --> 02:00:01.042
I didn't hurt him, he's not hurting me,
we're not hurting you.

02:00:01.113 --> 02:00:03.547
- Why are you interfering?
- I'm not interfering.

02:00:03.616 --> 02:00:06.449
- This is my family.
- I understand that.

02:00:06.518 --> 02:00:10.318
Your brother is not capable
of having a relationship with you.

02:00:10.389 --> 02:00:14.951
That's your opinion. Did you spend 24
hours a day, seven days a week with him?

02:00:15.027 --> 02:00:18.258
You cannot care for your brother
without professional guidance.

02:00:18.330 --> 02:00:21.094
- That's your opinion.
- Yes, it's my opinion.

02:00:21.166 --> 02:00:23.100
There's some things
I'd Like to go over.

02:00:23.168 --> 02:00:26.797
Dr. Bruner states a week ago you
stole Raymond out of the institution...

02:00:26.872 --> 02:00:29.739
and were willing to trade him
for $1.5 million, correct?

02:00:29.808 --> 02:00:31.639
My father died.
I was upset.

02:00:31.710 --> 02:00:33.405
That was wrong.

02:00:33.479 --> 02:00:36.880
Last week you were upset, and this week
you've found a devotion to him...

02:00:36.949 --> 02:00:39.509
and you want to
take care of him.

02:00:39.585 --> 02:00:41.746
Yes.

02:00:41.820 --> 02:00:44.914
From the beginning
it was Like a kidnapping.

02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:47.788
Kidnapping. That's very strong.
I didn't kidnap my brother.

02:00:47.860 --> 02:00:51.523
But in the course of a week, you came
to have an understanding with him.

02:00:51.597 --> 02:00:52.859
Yes.

02:00:52.932 --> 02:00:55.196
- Look, that--
- Yes?

02:00:55.267 --> 02:00:58.293
I understand that this sounds
irrational to you.

02:00:58.370 --> 02:01:00.361
When it started out--

02:01:00.439 --> 02:01:03.374
- Don't feel compelled to be defensive.
- Can I talk?

02:01:03.442 --> 02:01:06.104
- Yes, you can.
- Thank you.

02:01:06.178 --> 02:01:09.011
There's no accusations.
Go ahead.

02:01:09.081 --> 02:01:11.481
No accusations?

02:01:11.550 --> 02:01:14.576
See, you have to understand...

02:01:14.653 --> 02:01:18.885
that when we started out together
that he was only my brother...

02:01:18.958 --> 02:01:20.550
in name.

02:01:24.396 --> 02:01:25.988
And then...

02:01:29.134 --> 02:01:31.329
this morning we had pancakes.

02:01:31.403 --> 02:01:33.428
Maple syrup.
Maple syrup on the--

02:01:33.505 --> 02:01:35.996
Maple syrup on the table.

02:01:36.075 --> 02:01:38.509
And Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

02:01:39.678 --> 02:01:40.940
See, we--

02:01:42.748 --> 02:01:44.409
I made a connection.

02:01:44.483 --> 02:01:46.883
I think it's admirable
that you made a connection...

02:01:46.952 --> 02:01:50.353
but the purpose of this meeting is to
determine what is best for Raymond...

02:01:50.422 --> 02:01:53.220
whether or not he's capable
of functioning in the community...

02:01:53.292 --> 02:01:56.887
and what, in fact, he wants,
if that's possible to determine.

02:01:56.962 --> 02:01:58.327
I'm all for that.

02:01:58.397 --> 02:02:01.560
- Raymond's unable to make decisions.
- You're wrong.

02:02:01.633 --> 02:02:03.567
He can't decide for himself.

02:02:03.635 --> 02:02:06.001
He's capable
of a lot more than you know.

02:02:06.071 --> 02:02:08.437
Why don't we ask Raymond?

02:02:08.507 --> 02:02:12.307
Raymond, can I ask you
a few questions?

02:02:12.378 --> 02:02:15.108
- The doctor's talking to you.
- Can I ask you a few questions?

02:02:18.083 --> 02:02:20.017
Do you wanna stay
with your brother?

02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:25.019
Raymond, would you Like to stay
with your brother in Los Angeles?

02:02:25.090 --> 02:02:27.581
The doctor's asking you a question.

02:02:27.659 --> 02:02:29.786
- So you listen.
- Yeah.

02:02:29.862 --> 02:02:33.855
Raymond, do you wanna stay
with your brother Charlie?

02:02:33.932 --> 02:02:36.992
- Do you wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

02:02:37.069 --> 02:02:39.128
- You do?
- Yeah.

02:02:39.204 --> 02:02:40.466
You wanna stay with your brother?

02:02:40.539 --> 02:02:43.940
Yeah. I wanna stay with
my brother Charlie Babbitt.

02:02:44.009 --> 02:02:46.477
- That's what you want?
- Yeah.

02:02:47.713 --> 02:02:50.443
- You wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

02:02:53.819 --> 02:02:56.515
- Can I ask you something else?
- Yeah.

02:02:56.588 --> 02:02:59.648
- You wanna go back to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

02:02:59.725 --> 02:03:03.684
Raymond, can you make a distinction
between your brother and Wallbrook?

02:03:03.762 --> 02:03:05.195
Yeah.

02:03:06.532 --> 02:03:10.696
- Do you wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

02:03:10.769 --> 02:03:12.669
- Or do you wanna go to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

02:03:12.738 --> 02:03:14.797
They're two separate things.

02:03:14.873 --> 02:03:18.707
Your brother or Wallbrook?
It's not one thing, Raymond.

02:03:18.777 --> 02:03:22.304
- Back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie.
- Okay.

02:03:22.381 --> 02:03:26.340
- Back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie.
- Can you make that choice?

02:03:26.418 --> 02:03:28.852
- One or the other.
- Go back to Wallbrook.

02:03:28.921 --> 02:03:30.320
All right.

02:03:30.389 --> 02:03:32.550
Just hold on here.

02:03:32.624 --> 02:03:34.216
All right.

02:03:34.293 --> 02:03:37.524
All right.
You made your point.

02:03:37.596 --> 02:03:41.726
You don't have to humiliate him.
Ray, it's okay.

02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:43.927
- It's over.
- Yeah.

02:03:44.002 --> 02:03:46.937
Stay back at Wallbrook
with Charlie Babbitt.

02:03:47.005 --> 02:03:49.235
- Stay back at Wallbrook--
- It's over.

02:03:50.275 --> 02:03:52.266
- Raymond?
- Yeah.

02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:57.071
Dr. Bruner, can I talk to you?

02:03:57.149 --> 02:03:58.946
Excuse me.

02:04:07.044 --> 02:04:09.478
- You okay, Ray?
- Yeah.

02:04:11.315 --> 02:04:14.773
- You don't want more questions, do you?
- No.

02:04:17.187 --> 02:04:19.121
I don't know.

02:04:24.494 --> 02:04:28.021
- You don't want more questions, do you?
- No.

02:04:31.935 --> 02:04:34.665
- There won't be any more questions.
- Yeah.

02:04:34.738 --> 02:04:38.265
- I'll make sure of that.
- Yeah, main man.

02:04:39.610 --> 02:04:41.771
- What?
- My main man.

02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:47.783
Listen.

02:04:51.421 --> 02:04:54.686
Ray, I don't know if I'm gonna
have a chance to talk to you again.

02:04:58.028 --> 02:05:00.588
Because you see, these--

02:05:00.664 --> 02:05:04.930
Dr. Bruner really likes you a lot,
and he's probably gonna take you back.

02:05:05.836 --> 02:05:07.963
- You know?
- Yeah.

02:05:09.606 --> 02:05:13.736
What I said about being
on the road with you I meant.

02:05:14.811 --> 02:05:16.608
Connecting.

02:05:17.948 --> 02:05:22.317
- I Like having you for my brother.
- I'm an excellent driver.

02:05:22.386 --> 02:05:25.287
Yes, you are.

02:05:52.549 --> 02:05:55.177
I Like having you
for my big brother.

02:06:13.870 --> 02:06:16.202
C-H-A-R-L-l-E.

02:06:19.309 --> 02:06:21.937
C-H-A-R-L-l-E.

02:06:23.146 --> 02:06:24.909
Main man.

02:06:58.115 --> 02:07:00.242
May I have your attention, please?

02:07:00.317 --> 02:07:04.447
Amtrak train number 36,
the Desert Wind, eastbound...

02:07:04.521 --> 02:07:06.614
now boarding, track number three.

02:07:06.690 --> 02:07:10.126

02:07:10.193 --> 02:07:14.493
Las Vegas, Salt Lake City,
Denver, Omaha, Chicago.

02:07:21.004 --> 02:07:22.437
- Hello, Charlie.
- Dr. Bruner.

02:07:22.506 --> 02:07:23.768
Hello, Raymond.

02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:26.536
Wouldn't you feel more relaxed
in your favorite Kmart clothes?

02:07:26.610 --> 02:07:28.043
Tell him, Ray.

02:07:28.111 --> 02:07:30.170
- Kmart sucks.
- I see.

02:07:30.247 --> 02:07:34.445
I have the tickets, and I'll be on
this car right here to the right.

02:07:34.518 --> 02:07:38.079
Why don't you take a couple of minutes?
See you, Charlie.

02:07:39.256 --> 02:07:42.191
You made a joke, Ray.

02:07:46.963 --> 02:07:51.024
I guess I'd better give this to you.
You're gonna have to carry this now.

02:07:52.536 --> 02:07:55.994
It's got your cheeseballs,
your apple juice...

02:07:56.072 --> 02:07:58.040
notebooks, pens and...

02:07:58.108 --> 02:08:00.542
'Who's On First?' video
that you Like.

02:08:00.610 --> 02:08:03.670
- 'Who's On First?' is very funny.
- I told you it's funny.

02:08:03.747 --> 02:08:05.237
Board!

02:08:05.315 --> 02:08:08.409
- Better get goin'.
- Very shiny train.

02:08:08.485 --> 02:08:10.919
Yeah, it sure is.

02:08:10.987 --> 02:08:14.184
Now listen, Ray.
Dr. Bruner only has custody of you.

02:08:14.257 --> 02:08:17.055
That doesn't mean I can't visit.

02:08:17.127 --> 02:08:19.925
I'm comin' to see you in two weeks.

02:08:19.996 --> 02:08:22.829

02:08:27.671 --> 02:08:29.070
Mystifying.

02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:32.638
'Course, that's 20,160 minutes.

02:08:32.709 --> 02:08:37.612

02:08:37.681 --> 02:08:39.114

02:08:51.461 --> 02:08:52.894
I'll see you soon.

02:08:52.963 --> 02:08:55.557
Yeah.
One for bad, two for good.

02:08:59.703 --> 02:09:01.136
Bet two for good.
