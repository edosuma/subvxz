00:02.501 --> 00:04.402
<i>(all)</i> tool time!

00:04.403 --> 00:07.038
That's right! Binford tools
is proud to present

00:07.039 --> 00:09.774
Tim "the tool man" taylor.
Whoo!

00:14.647 --> 00:16.648
Thank you, heidi.
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

00:16.649 --> 00:18.416
I am tim "the tool man" taylor.

00:18.417 --> 00:21.920
I think you all know
my assistant - al...
Borland.

00:23.756 --> 00:25.624
Today on <i>tool time,</i>

00:25.625 --> 00:28.359
Tim and I are going to be
talking about refinishing.

00:28.360 --> 00:29.995
That's right, al.

00:29.996 --> 00:31.930
Just when you're finished
repairing that old table,

00:31.931 --> 00:35.366
You think you're finished,
but you're not really finished
until you refinish.

00:35.367 --> 00:37.368
Are you finished?

00:37.369 --> 00:39.871
No, but I have an uncle
who lives in denmark.

00:42.174 --> 00:44.776
Tim.
Actually,
his name's lars.

00:47.079 --> 00:49.648
We've taken the first coat
off of this table,

00:49.649 --> 00:51.983
Now we're ready to sand it down
and put our last coat of stain
on there.

00:51.984 --> 00:55.787
Before you get started,
be sure to wear protective
eyewear and dust mask.

00:55.788 --> 00:56.855
That's right.

00:56.856 --> 00:58.990
Allergic reactions to wood
are common

00:58.991 --> 01:02.460
When working with members
of the nut-bearing family.

01:05.931 --> 01:07.532
Like the borlands.

01:09.334 --> 01:13.271
It's also a good idea
to wear protective gloves.

01:13.272 --> 01:15.373
Al, you're starting to act
like my mother.

01:15.374 --> 01:18.409
If that beard were any thicker,
you'd look like your mother.

01:23.582 --> 01:25.684
Tim, I think it's a good idea
to wear the gloves.

01:25.685 --> 01:28.486
I've been working with wood
all my life.
I'm not allergic to hardwood.

01:28.487 --> 01:31.723
That's not the point.
There's a lot of dust
here and...

01:31.724 --> 01:34.159
Well, you can develop
an allergy over time.

01:34.160 --> 01:38.997
Symptoms can include
puffiness around the eyes,
severe rash, extreme swelling.

01:38.998 --> 01:42.067
Oh, al,
I think you may be right.
My eyes are really itchy.

02:57.476 --> 02:59.510
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

03:03.415 --> 03:05.583
Al, we just had lunch
with the crew.

03:05.584 --> 03:09.888
They loved the gag today.
Klaus almost choked
on his hot dog.

03:09.889 --> 03:12.190
They loved the way
the hands swelled up.

03:12.191 --> 03:15.160
Not as swelled up
as your head.

03:15.161 --> 03:17.328
What's eating your shorts?

03:17.329 --> 03:21.166
My shorts are fine,
thank you.

03:21.167 --> 03:23.734
You're gonna be
a load of laughs
at dinner tonight.

03:23.735 --> 03:27.071
Not like you've ever been
a load of laughs.

03:27.072 --> 03:29.974
I don't think that
ilene and I can make it.

03:29.975 --> 03:33.278
Jill's expecting you.
It's not a good night for us.

03:33.279 --> 03:35.980
Why not?

03:35.981 --> 03:38.016
It's personal. I don't
wanna talk about it.

03:38.017 --> 03:41.853
I won't tell anybody.
I'm your best friend.
I'm your only friend.

03:41.854 --> 03:45.056
It's a remark like that
that makes me
not wanna tell you.

03:45.057 --> 03:49.560
I'm kidding. I can see
a big flannel cloud
hovering over your head.

03:49.561 --> 03:52.330
Come on, al. Tell me
what's the matter.

03:55.801 --> 04:00.604
Well, last night, something
very disturbing happened.

04:00.605 --> 04:03.208
Ilene... Had a dream.

04:03.209 --> 04:05.676
No.

04:05.677 --> 04:09.380
Not a dream.
While she was sleeping?

04:09.381 --> 04:11.682
<i>(whistles)</i>

04:11.683 --> 04:14.485
Scientists may want
to study her.

04:14.486 --> 04:17.188
You don't understand.
It was a very passionate dream.

04:17.189 --> 04:20.524
Clothes were strewn about.
Not strewn about!

04:21.927 --> 04:24.462
Yes, strewn.

04:24.463 --> 04:28.466
She was talking to this man who
she said had a very deep voice.

04:28.467 --> 04:32.670
And they were... They were
riding a golden stallion,

04:32.671 --> 04:35.473
And he was wearing
bicycle shorts.

04:40.712 --> 04:42.713
Get a grip, will you?

04:42.714 --> 04:45.750
It's a dream. Don't you dream
about other women sometimes?

04:45.751 --> 04:49.720
No! My dreams
are good, clean fun.

04:49.721 --> 04:53.057
You're driving yourself crazy
over a silly dream
with some jerk in it.

04:53.058 --> 04:56.761
Well, it wasn't just some jerk,
tim. It was you.

04:58.830 --> 05:01.299
Really?
Oh, I shouldn't have
told you that.

05:01.300 --> 05:02.967
Sure you should have.

05:02.968 --> 05:06.104
A golden stallion.
Hyah! Hyah!

05:06.105 --> 05:08.572
Tight bicycle shorts.
Tim!

05:08.573 --> 05:10.942
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...

05:10.943 --> 05:15.046
It's just a dream,
a very common dream.

05:15.047 --> 05:17.048
Women all over
the tri-state area

05:17.049 --> 05:20.385
Look at me
as a symbol of virility.

05:20.386 --> 05:23.788
All I can say is,
I don't want you showing up
in her dreams again,

05:23.789 --> 05:26.157
Or there's gonna be trouble.

05:28.127 --> 05:31.062
What, are you gonna
fall asleep and dream like
you're beating me up?

05:33.399 --> 05:36.100
Ok, I know that
it's not your fault.

05:36.101 --> 05:39.904
It's just that ilene
means so much to me.

05:39.905 --> 05:42.040
And, well...

05:42.041 --> 05:45.276
I wanted to be the one
on that golden stallion
riding into the sunset,

05:45.277 --> 05:48.246
Wearing skimpy
bicycle shorts.

05:49.648 --> 05:52.417
<i>(whistles)</i> there's
a pretty picture.

06:01.460 --> 06:04.329
E-a-t. "eat."

06:04.330 --> 06:06.630
Ok, that's three points.

06:06.631 --> 06:10.401
And it only took you
half an hour
to come up with it.

06:12.904 --> 06:15.106
Ok, randy.
It's your turn.

06:15.107 --> 06:18.476
All right. I'll put an "m"
on top of the "e,"

06:18.477 --> 06:21.712
And then "l-o-n."
that's "melon."

06:21.713 --> 06:25.049
Double word score -
14 points.

06:25.050 --> 06:28.019
Pretty good.
Watch this.

06:29.654 --> 06:35.293
After the "n,"
I'll add "o-l-o-g-y."

06:35.294 --> 06:37.862
That's 16 points.

06:43.268 --> 06:45.003
"melonology"?

06:47.672 --> 06:49.807
The study of melons.

06:52.411 --> 06:54.945
There's no such word
as "melonology."

06:54.946 --> 06:58.816
Yeah, there is.
Call the fruit section
at the grocery store.

06:58.817 --> 07:02.053
Who should I ask for -
the melonologist?

07:03.222 --> 07:05.356
Hey. Hi, guys.
Hey, dad.

07:05.357 --> 07:06.657
Hey, dad.
Hey, dad.

07:06.658 --> 07:10.161
Scrabble. That's a great way
to learn words.

07:10.162 --> 07:12.997
Who put down "melonology"?
Brad.

07:12.998 --> 07:14.198
Me!

07:14.199 --> 07:16.000
All right.

07:18.970 --> 07:20.505
Hi.
Hi.

07:20.506 --> 07:22.640
I'm so proud of brad.

07:22.641 --> 07:25.510
Playing scrabble,
he came up with "melonology."

07:25.511 --> 07:27.645
That's not a word, tim.

07:27.646 --> 07:30.248
Melonology - the study
of guys named mel.

07:32.084 --> 07:34.952
Did you tell al and ilene
to come for dinner at seven?

07:34.953 --> 07:38.456
Yeah. They almost
didn't come.

07:38.457 --> 07:41.459
Al's upset because apparently
ilene had a dream about me.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.827
What'd she eat
before she went to sleep?

07:45.497 --> 07:49.900
Get this. She dreamed that
I was riding a golden stallion,

07:49.901 --> 07:52.636
With a deep sexy voice
and tight bicycle shorts.

07:54.139 --> 07:57.775
Wow! She must have had
a big bean burrito.

08:01.180 --> 08:03.847
Really? A lot of women
watch <i>tool time.</i>

08:03.848 --> 08:08.486
Sooner or later,
they are thinking,
"I want him."

08:15.127 --> 08:18.362
Smirk if you will,
but you're not the only woman
who dreams about me.

08:18.363 --> 08:20.364
I don't dream
about you, tim.

08:20.365 --> 08:23.000
It's bad enough
I have to see you
when I'm awake.

08:23.001 --> 08:25.436
Hey, guys, guys!
Come take this laundry.

08:25.437 --> 08:27.538
Take it upstairs,
fold it and put it away.

08:27.539 --> 08:29.840
Sure, mom.
Yes, mother.

08:32.644 --> 08:35.513
They actually did it.

08:35.514 --> 08:38.982
Be honest with me.
When you dream about me,
what am I usually wearing?

08:38.984 --> 08:41.952
I told you. I don't
dream about you.

08:41.953 --> 08:44.855
Who do you dream about?
You know, the usual.

08:44.856 --> 08:47.925
Like mario andretti, al unser,
that sort of stuff?

08:47.926 --> 08:50.461
No. That's who you
dream about.

08:50.462 --> 08:53.264
The guy that I dream about
isn't even real.

08:53.265 --> 08:57.602
If he's not real, it's,
like, a cartoon character,
like bullwinkle?

08:57.603 --> 09:00.171
No, tim.
It's not bullwinkle.

09:00.172 --> 09:02.106
Scooby-doo?

09:02.107 --> 09:07.178
<i>(laughs)</i> yeah, that's right.
You really know me!
Me and scooby-doo.

09:07.179 --> 09:11.649
I hold scooby's hand.
We walk along the scooby-beach.

09:11.650 --> 09:14.118
Do a little scooby-diving.

09:18.557 --> 09:21.859
Come on! If it isn't scooby-doo
or bullwinkle, who is it?

09:21.860 --> 09:24.028
I'm not gonna tell you.
You'll make fun of me.

09:24.029 --> 09:26.531
No, no.
I'll make you a deal.

09:26.532 --> 09:28.999
I'll tell you what I
dream about if you tell me
what you dream about.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.101
I don't wanna know
what you dream about.

09:31.102 --> 09:33.304
All right, it's your turn.
<i>(laughs)</i>

09:35.707 --> 09:40.077
All right.
If you must know...

09:40.078 --> 09:42.046
I dream about tarzan.

09:44.283 --> 09:45.983
Tarzan of the jungle?

09:45.984 --> 09:49.887
No, tarzan of st. Louis.

09:49.888 --> 09:52.790
Tarzan doesn't even
have a car.

09:52.791 --> 09:57.428
We don't need a car.
We never leave the tree house.

09:57.429 --> 09:59.330
It's just tarzan and me.
I'm jane.

09:59.331 --> 10:01.332
I'm wearing this cute
leopard-skinned outfit,

10:01.333 --> 10:04.335
And I have big,
beautiful breasts.

10:05.404 --> 10:07.871
I dream about that, too.

10:14.879 --> 10:18.015
What's the big deal
about tarzan?

10:18.016 --> 10:23.887
Well, tarzan's very strong
but sensitive.

10:23.888 --> 10:28.426
Takes me in his arms,
pulls me up to this big,
huge, muscular chest.

10:28.427 --> 10:32.563
I can hear his heart beating.
My heart beats faster.

10:32.564 --> 10:35.099
I close my eyes,
he starts kissing my neck...

10:35.100 --> 10:37.668
Jill...
Then he starts kissing...

10:37.669 --> 10:39.670
Got a minute?

10:40.772 --> 10:43.307
Sorry.

10:43.308 --> 10:45.376
God, is it hot in here?

10:50.349 --> 10:53.784
You told al and ilene seven,
right? It's ten after.
They're still not here.

10:53.785 --> 10:56.854
Ilene probably wanted
to get in a nap,

10:56.855 --> 10:59.223
Have one more dream about me
before tonight.

11:01.460 --> 11:06.230
Stop it right there! No jokes
about ilene's dream tonight.

11:06.231 --> 11:08.432
The last thing in the world
I wanna talk about tonight

11:08.433 --> 11:12.102
Is me on
a golden stallion,

11:12.103 --> 11:14.538
Dressed in bicycle shorts
so tight,

11:14.539 --> 11:18.476
No woman could resist me.

11:18.477 --> 11:20.978
This is not something
that you should joke about.

11:20.979 --> 11:22.980
You saying I can't be myself
in my own home?

11:22.981 --> 11:25.683
Yes, exactly. Be somebody else.
Anybody else.

11:25.684 --> 11:28.118
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

11:28.119 --> 11:30.554
I certainly hope ilene
can control herself.

11:30.555 --> 11:34.258
You know how sexy
my deep voice is to her.

11:34.259 --> 11:36.794
Then do us all a favor
and shut up.

11:36.795 --> 11:39.163
Hi! Come on in.
Hi.

11:39.164 --> 11:42.166
It's great of you
to have us over.
It's nice to have you.

11:42.167 --> 11:44.234
I brought
a very lovely tart.

11:44.235 --> 11:48.372
Al, that's no way
to talk about ilene.

11:48.373 --> 11:49.973
I was talking about...

11:49.974 --> 11:52.410
Honey, he was kidding.

11:52.411 --> 11:55.212
You have a delightful
sense of humor.
Thanks. I try.

11:55.213 --> 11:58.349
Well, I have a delightful
sense of humor, too.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.318
A lot of people
find me hilarious.

12:00.319 --> 12:04.488
Of course you are.
It's just that your humor
is more... Subtle.

12:04.489 --> 12:06.957
Yeah. Sometimes al
doesn't even get it.

12:08.727 --> 12:10.728
You guys want some wine?
I'd love some.

12:10.729 --> 12:12.730
I could be persuaded
to partake.

12:12.731 --> 12:15.666
Would you like to sit down?
Could you take the cheese
with you when you go?

12:15.667 --> 12:16.934
Great.

12:16.935 --> 12:20.538
I love a good cheese ball.

12:20.539 --> 12:22.606
So, ilene,
how was work today?

12:22.607 --> 12:25.743
Actually, I had
a pretty tough day today.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.812
Well, you know what they say
about the dental world -

12:27.813 --> 12:30.080
"it's like pulling teeth."

12:32.016 --> 12:33.984
It's pulling teeth.
<i>(forced laugh)</i>

12:36.187 --> 12:39.189
Actually, most orthodontists
don't pull teeth.

12:39.190 --> 12:43.193
Well, I know that.
I was making a joke.
Oh.

12:43.194 --> 12:44.628
And a good one.

12:44.629 --> 12:47.832
Just a lot more subtle
than one I would have picked.

12:47.833 --> 12:48.966
Cheers!

12:48.967 --> 12:50.568
Cheers!
Cheers!

12:50.569 --> 12:52.903
I'm trying a new recipe.
I hope you all like it.

12:52.904 --> 12:56.206
Oh, I'm sure it'll be
great. I'm so hungry,
I could eat a horse.

12:56.207 --> 12:57.842
<i>(al and tim choke)</i>

13:06.251 --> 13:07.284
You're in luck.

13:10.422 --> 13:12.356
Jill cooked stallion.
Tim.

13:14.693 --> 13:16.727
Did I say "stallion"?
I meant "scallion."

13:16.728 --> 13:20.163
Big golden scallion.

13:23.568 --> 13:25.002
Tim, would you just...?

13:25.003 --> 13:26.637
I'm talking about
scallions.

13:26.638 --> 13:28.572
I know what
you're talking about.

13:28.573 --> 13:32.510
Well, it's not like I said
she's cooking bicycle shorts.

13:35.547 --> 13:38.916
Wait a minute.
Bicycle shorts?

13:38.917 --> 13:41.452
Al, did you tell him
about my dream?

13:41.453 --> 13:45.556
Well, no. I... Yes.

13:45.557 --> 13:49.293
I told you that in confidence.
And I told you that
in confidence.

13:49.294 --> 13:51.495
And I told you not
to bring up ilene's dream!

13:51.496 --> 13:53.664
Tim told you?
You told jill?

13:53.665 --> 13:55.933
He shouldn't have.
Al, this is your fault.

13:55.934 --> 13:58.536
It's tim's fault.
It's not. She had the dream.

13:58.537 --> 14:00.538
Would you please shut up?

14:00.539 --> 14:02.606
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What are we talking about?

14:02.607 --> 14:04.909
It's out. Now we can
laugh about it, huh?

14:04.910 --> 14:06.944
I have never been
so embarrassed.

14:06.945 --> 14:09.246
Tim, I... Ilene!

14:09.247 --> 14:13.584
Guys, guys, come on.
What's the big deal?
It's just a silly dream.

14:13.585 --> 14:15.920
Jill dreams about being naked,
running around with tarzan.

14:15.921 --> 14:16.887
Tim!

14:20.358 --> 14:25.429
How can I confide in you again?
I tell you something in private
and now the world knows.

14:25.430 --> 14:28.165
It's not like
the world knows.
I'm really sorry, jill.

14:28.166 --> 14:30.167
I'm sorry, too. I...

14:33.237 --> 14:36.306
Ilene, come on.
What?

14:37.375 --> 14:38.776
<i>(grunts)</i>

14:39.845 --> 14:41.846
You gotta like
guests like that

14:41.847 --> 14:44.147
That don't overstay
their welcome.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.822
<i>(ilene)</i> I thought
you and I were...

14:51.823 --> 14:54.859
...Tell tim about me.
Get away from that window!

14:54.860 --> 14:57.094
They're really going at it
out there.

14:57.095 --> 14:59.096
Tim, I hope
you're happy now.

14:59.097 --> 15:01.331
Do you ever stop and think
before you make stupid jokes?

15:01.332 --> 15:03.333
I couldn't help it.
She said "horse."

15:03.334 --> 15:05.335
The only thing you could
come up with is,

15:05.336 --> 15:09.039
"at least she's not cooking
bicycle shorts"?

15:09.040 --> 15:11.675
You are supposed to be
al's friend.

15:11.676 --> 15:12.943
I am al's friend.

15:12.944 --> 15:14.945
He was really upset
about this,

15:14.946 --> 15:16.947
And I was trying to help him
get over it.

15:16.948 --> 15:20.317
By embarrassing him.
No, no, no, no,
by making him laugh.

15:20.318 --> 15:23.053
I thought
if he laughed, he'd realize
this is just a silly dream.

15:23.054 --> 15:26.390
How do you think al's
feeling now? How do you
think ilene is feeling?

15:26.391 --> 15:28.726
You told them about
my tarzan dream!

15:28.727 --> 15:30.528
Well, how do you think
I'm feeling?

15:34.599 --> 15:37.501
What do you have
to feel bad about?

15:37.502 --> 15:39.770
I don't know.
Give me a minute.

15:39.771 --> 15:41.906
Jill, it's gonna be ok.

15:41.907 --> 15:44.174
They're a couple,
they had a little tiff.

15:44.175 --> 15:46.911
They'll get over it.
Every relationship goes through
stuff like this.

15:46.912 --> 15:49.780
In the long run,
al's gonna thank me for this.

15:49.781 --> 15:53.316
Well, thank you, tim.
There you go.

15:53.317 --> 15:56.720
Ilene broke up with me,
she took my car and never
wants to see me again.

15:56.721 --> 16:00.290
Al, she's coming back.
How would you know?

16:00.291 --> 16:02.793
Well, if she doesn't,
it's grand theft auto.

16:14.405 --> 16:17.708
Practicing for the ballet,
wilson?

16:17.709 --> 16:21.579
No, tim. I'm just
reacquainting myself
with t'ai chi,

16:21.580 --> 16:25.515
An ancient form
of chinese exercise.

16:25.516 --> 16:28.151
It balances
the female and the male,

16:28.152 --> 16:30.387
The yin and the yang.

16:31.957 --> 16:35.759
From over here,
the yin thinks the yang
is a "yidiot."

16:35.760 --> 16:39.229
<i>(chuckles)</i>

16:39.230 --> 16:40.530
Troubles, neighbor tim?

16:40.531 --> 16:42.199
I don't know... Troubles.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.168
Al's girlfriend ilene
had a dream about me,

16:45.169 --> 16:48.706
So I made a joke about it,
and she got upset
and broke up with al.

16:48.707 --> 16:50.708
Jill thinks
it's all my fault.

16:50.709 --> 16:54.044
Tim, humor can be
a wonderful thing.

16:54.045 --> 16:58.582
The koran says,
"he deserves paradise who
makes his companions laugh."

16:58.583 --> 17:02.987
Yeah... Those koreans
know what's funny.

17:09.060 --> 17:10.761
On the other hand, tim,

17:10.762 --> 17:13.964
Cervantes,
the 16th-century novelist,
said...

17:13.964 --> 17:17.800
"a jest that gives pain
is no jest."

17:17.801 --> 17:20.303
In this case, you might have
caused a little bit of pain.

17:20.304 --> 17:22.539
I certainly didn't mean to.

17:22.540 --> 17:25.742
Jokes are what I'm all about.
That's why people like me.

17:25.743 --> 17:28.846
Well, maybe sometimes
you go too far.

17:28.847 --> 17:31.481
I just didn't take the dream
that seriously.

17:31.482 --> 17:35.919
Some people do. You know,
dreams can have a deep
and profound meaning.

17:35.920 --> 17:38.622
You know what
the psychoanalyst
carl jung said?

17:38.623 --> 17:42.126
Yin, yang, jung?
Where does it end, wilson?

17:42.127 --> 17:45.963
Jung said dreams were merely
symbols of something else.

17:45.964 --> 17:50.034
Plus,
he recognized the significance
of names and letters in dreams.

17:50.035 --> 17:52.402
In particular,
first initials.

17:52.403 --> 17:55.906
Hmm. First initials, huh?

17:55.907 --> 17:59.509
Jill dreams about
tarzan and jane.
That's a "t" and a "j."

17:59.510 --> 18:01.611
She's jane, that's jill.
Mm-hmm.

18:01.612 --> 18:05.315
"t" could be tim. Tim and jill.
We're tarzan and jane?

18:05.316 --> 18:07.651
Very good, tarzan.
Jung would be impressed.

18:07.652 --> 18:09.286
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

18:11.890 --> 18:14.191
Hi, heidi.
Hi, tim.

18:14.192 --> 18:16.960
Al, I called to see
if you needed a ride,
but you were gone.

18:16.961 --> 18:18.896
Heidi gave me a ride.

18:18.897 --> 18:21.231
So ilene still has your car?

18:21.232 --> 18:23.734
Yes.

18:23.735 --> 18:25.569
Buddy, on the bright side,

18:25.570 --> 18:28.839
Without a car,
you get some exercise.
Ride your bike to work.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.774
I'll loan you
my bicycle shorts.

18:34.179 --> 18:37.081
Sorry, tim, I'm not
my usual jocular self.

18:37.082 --> 18:39.817
Well, the other night,

18:39.818 --> 18:42.352
I certainly didn't mean
to upset you or ilene.

18:42.353 --> 18:44.688
I shoot my mouth off,

18:44.689 --> 18:47.224
And you're just
a big, bearded bull's-eye.

18:49.393 --> 18:51.895
Was that supposed
to be an apology?

18:51.896 --> 18:53.530
Yeah.

18:53.531 --> 18:56.867
You see?
Even in your apologies,
you have to insult me.

18:56.868 --> 19:00.204
I'm kidding. You want to
rehearse for the show?

19:00.205 --> 19:03.340
You never
want to rehearse.

19:03.341 --> 19:05.375
I thought it'd make you
feel better.

19:05.376 --> 19:07.477
It's not gonna make me
feel better.

19:07.478 --> 19:10.480
Al, I only make fun of people
and joke around with people
I like.

19:10.481 --> 19:12.582
You must like me
an awful lot.

19:12.583 --> 19:15.753
I think of you
like one of my brothers.

19:15.754 --> 19:18.588
You do?
Yeah. I joked with them
all the time.

19:18.589 --> 19:22.192
That's why most of them
won't speak to me to this day.

19:24.528 --> 19:26.563
So what you're saying
is that

19:26.564 --> 19:30.500
When you make fun of
my weight and my beard,
it's because you like me?

19:30.501 --> 19:31.434
Yeah.

19:32.971 --> 19:36.273
How about when you tease me
about wearing flannel?

19:38.276 --> 19:40.911
I do that because
you look ridiculous.

19:46.684 --> 19:48.752
Well, I never
told you this, tim,

19:48.753 --> 19:52.622
But I think of you
as a brother, too.

19:56.727 --> 19:59.096
Ilene.
Of course you lean.
You're lopsided.

20:03.367 --> 20:04.968
Down there.

20:04.969 --> 20:08.806
I just stopped by
to give you your car.

20:08.807 --> 20:11.308
I got to go back to work.

20:12.944 --> 20:17.214
Ilene, I am so sorry
that I told tim
about that dream.

20:17.215 --> 20:19.216
It's just that
I was so upset.

20:19.217 --> 20:22.585
I didn't feel like
I was man enough for you.

20:22.586 --> 20:25.522
You really felt that way?

20:26.825 --> 20:29.126
Yes.

20:29.127 --> 20:34.464
Oh, al, you are the manliest man
I've ever met.

20:36.567 --> 20:40.370
Well, then why were you
dreaming about tim?

20:40.371 --> 20:44.308
Oh, could I take a crack
at that one?

20:44.309 --> 20:48.511
There's this
korean philosopher,
yin yang jung,

20:48.512 --> 20:51.514
And he talks
about dreams, and dreams
are a lot about initials.

20:51.515 --> 20:53.951
She's dreaming about
tim taylor, it's "tt."

20:53.952 --> 20:56.854
It could have been
"tub of tomatoes,"
"tony the tiger..."

20:56.855 --> 20:59.957
Oh, "tater tot."
tater tot, that's it.
Tater tot.

20:59.958 --> 21:03.360
You put a flannel shirt
on a tater tot, you got you.

21:04.963 --> 21:06.596
Thanks, tim.
Mm-hmm.

21:06.597 --> 21:08.665
You've been
a big help.

21:08.666 --> 21:10.901
I'm good with dreams.

21:10.902 --> 21:15.372
Oh, al, it was just
a silly dream.

21:15.373 --> 21:20.410
When I'm awake,
all I dream about is you.

21:20.411 --> 21:23.613
Well, all I dream about
is you.

21:23.614 --> 21:26.116
Really?
Yes.

21:40.765 --> 21:46.236
You know, I'm thinking "tt"
could be <i>"tool time."</i>

21:46.237 --> 21:48.671
It could be... Ooh-how!

21:50.474 --> 21:52.075
Ta-ta!

22:05.423 --> 22:06.756
Tim!

22:08.359 --> 22:10.593
Wow!

22:10.594 --> 22:12.896
Roses, champagne.

22:12.897 --> 22:17.401
Oh! You even put
the little butter knives on.

22:17.402 --> 22:19.202
Tim?

22:19.203 --> 22:20.537
Where are you?

22:23.274 --> 22:24.507
Tim?

22:35.719 --> 22:36.719
Tim?

22:45.396 --> 22:48.065
<i>(tarzan yell)</i>

22:50.134 --> 22:52.769
It's 15 degrees out there.

22:52.770 --> 22:54.838
You jane, me frozen.

22:59.410 --> 23:02.012
Somebody get macy's
on the phone.
Hey, hey, hey!

23:14.525 --> 23:16.460
He looks like a blowfish!

23:18.796 --> 23:20.597
This little piggy
went to market.

23:20.598 --> 23:22.532
This little piggy
went home.

23:24.835 --> 23:27.770
Shouldn't have had
that last burrito, huh?
