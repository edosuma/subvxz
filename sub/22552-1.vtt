01:11.883 --> 01:13.784
Harris?

01:14.452 --> 01:15.719
You must be Rachel.

01:15.721 --> 01:16.887
- Yeah.
- Hey.

01:17.922 --> 01:18.989
Oh.

01:18.991 --> 01:20.724
Oh, sorry, I'm a hugger.

01:20.726 --> 01:22.859
That's, that's okay.

01:22.861 --> 01:24.461
I'm super awkward at the
beginning of these things.

01:24.463 --> 01:28.065
Oh, well, that is why
they invented alcohol.

01:28.067 --> 01:31.068
Hey, man, uh, could we
get one more scotch,

01:31.070 --> 01:33.370
and for Rachel, a... wait, wait.

01:34.338 --> 01:35.939
Uh, let me guess.

01:40.011 --> 01:41.445
What are you doing?

01:41.447 --> 01:43.013
Oh, I can sense a
person's drink aura.

01:43.015 --> 01:44.381
I just need a moment of silence.

01:44.383 --> 01:45.916
My drink aura?

01:50.255 --> 01:51.255
Sorry.

01:52.223 --> 01:53.223
Vodka tonic.

01:53.225 --> 01:54.958
Yeah.

01:54.960 --> 01:57.327
Wait, wait, wait, I'm
also seeing tequila shots.

01:57.329 --> 01:58.328
Rach, I don't know about that.

01:58.330 --> 01:59.763
I did not think that.

01:59.765 --> 02:01.264
Far be it from
me to tell a lady no.

02:01.266 --> 02:02.933
Two tequila shots.

02:02.935 --> 02:03.935
Thanks, man.

02:05.870 --> 02:07.504
You don't mess around, huh?

02:07.506 --> 02:09.339
I guess not.

02:16.180 --> 02:17.314
Leaving?

02:17.316 --> 02:20.317
Oh, hey, yeah.

02:20.319 --> 02:21.752
Didn't want to wake you.

02:21.754 --> 02:23.954
I got work in the morning.

02:23.956 --> 02:28.325
Plus, I have self-diagnosed
restless leg syndrome, so.

02:30.996 --> 02:32.095
But, uh, hey.

02:37.369 --> 02:39.069
I had a lot of fun.

02:39.071 --> 02:40.071
Me too.

02:41.506 --> 02:43.774
All right, sleep tight.

03:12.270 --> 03:13.236
Boom!

03:13.238 --> 03:14.271
Got you again, ShadowMan.

03:14.273 --> 03:15.272
Suck my dick, pussy.

03:15.274 --> 03:16.840
No, come on, man.

03:16.842 --> 03:18.942
It's too early for
that kind of talk.

03:18.944 --> 03:21.311
It's not too early
for your mom to suck my dick.

03:21.313 --> 03:22.379
Eh, clever.

03:25.884 --> 03:27.350
Oh, and I win again.

03:28.820 --> 03:30.253
See you next time, Shadow.

03:30.255 --> 03:31.121
Hope you have a
good day in school.

03:31.123 --> 03:32.489
What grade you in again?

03:32.491 --> 03:34.591
You have a good day being a fag.

03:34.593 --> 03:36.426
Easy with the
homophobia there, kid.

03:36.428 --> 03:37.527
Shut up.

03:37.529 --> 03:38.829
You got it.

03:53.945 --> 03:54.611
Hey.

03:54.613 --> 03:56.046
Hey, morning.

03:58.349 --> 03:59.916
What's up, man?

03:59.918 --> 04:01.151
Mandarin, Jose.

04:12.330 --> 04:13.964
150 likes.

04:13.966 --> 04:15.298
Fuckin' clickbait.

04:18.536 --> 04:20.370
Cute, who's she?

04:20.372 --> 04:22.038
She's my ex.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.507
She used to call blow jobs blowies.

04:24.509 --> 04:28.078
Now she's engaged to
Richard Rodemeier.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.881
This fuckin' bald piece of shit.

04:30.883 --> 04:32.315
Looks like a banker.

04:32.317 --> 04:33.550
What do you think he does?
You think he banks?

04:33.552 --> 04:35.485
Let's have a look.

04:35.487 --> 04:39.623
Pediatric surgeon at Ralph M.
Captain Children's Hospital.

04:39.625 --> 04:40.625
Oh, no.

04:42.026 --> 04:44.327
That's a bummer.

04:44.329 --> 04:46.062
Whatever, man, he still
looks like a piece of shit.

04:46.064 --> 04:47.163
Of that I have no doubt.

04:47.165 --> 04:48.899
You should unfriend her, man.

04:48.901 --> 04:50.533
It's not healthy, you
can drive yourself crazy.

04:50.535 --> 04:52.469
I know, I know, man.

04:52.471 --> 04:54.337
I just can't help it.

04:54.339 --> 04:55.505
Robby, boom.

04:59.944 --> 05:01.511
Harris, Robby, morning.

05:01.513 --> 05:03.079
- Hi.
- Hey, Terri.

05:03.081 --> 05:04.381
The partners and I
made a decision about

05:04.383 --> 05:06.516
the Harry's Auto Insurance spot.

05:06.518 --> 05:08.952
You both had damn good ideas.

05:08.954 --> 05:12.088
But Harris, we're
going with you.

05:12.090 --> 05:13.590
Thanks, Terri.

05:13.592 --> 05:15.358
Well, they're gonna
be here on Wednesday.

05:15.360 --> 05:16.393
You'll be ready
to pitch by then?

05:16.395 --> 05:17.594
Absolutely.

05:17.596 --> 05:20.196
Excellent, keep
up the good work.

05:20.198 --> 05:21.198
You too, Robby.

05:25.269 --> 05:26.136
Better luck next time, Robert.

05:26.138 --> 05:27.637
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:27.639 --> 05:30.974
Think you just got it all
figured out, don't you?

05:30.976 --> 05:33.543
I like to think so, yeah.

05:37.515 --> 05:39.249
Linda, 26.

05:39.251 --> 05:43.553
"I like adventure,
whiskey, sarcasm, Jenga."

05:43.555 --> 05:44.721
She's cute, should
I go left or right?

05:44.723 --> 05:46.089
It's your choice, man.

05:46.091 --> 05:47.958
Mm-mm.
It's your profile.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.460
Eh, I pretty much
always swipe right.

05:50.462 --> 05:52.362
Even if you don't like 'em?

05:52.364 --> 05:53.997
That's putting the
cart before the horse.

05:53.999 --> 05:55.565
At this point, it's
just a numbers game.

05:55.567 --> 05:59.402
Say you swipe right
100 times a day, right?

05:59.404 --> 06:02.405
Out of those 100 likes,
you get 20 matches,

06:02.407 --> 06:05.508
out of those 20 matches,
you message 10,

06:05.510 --> 06:08.578
out of those 10, only
a handful message back,

06:08.580 --> 06:12.349
and out of that handful, you
end up meeting up with one.

06:12.351 --> 06:15.151
What that means is, the
more you like initially,

06:15.153 --> 06:16.686
the higher your chances
are of meeting up

06:16.688 --> 06:18.388
with someone later.

06:18.390 --> 06:20.991
The Tao of swiping.

06:20.993 --> 06:22.425
I'm gonna swipe right,
here we go.

06:22.427 --> 06:24.160
Boom!

06:24.162 --> 06:26.429
- It's a match. God damn.
- Thank you very much.

06:26.431 --> 06:28.131
Technology, it's a great thing.

06:28.133 --> 06:29.466
You know, if this was
around when I was single...

06:29.468 --> 06:30.468
Yeah?

06:31.436 --> 06:33.570
Okay, keep browsing.

06:33.572 --> 06:35.338
Oh!

06:35.340 --> 06:37.007
What about this one?

06:39.343 --> 06:42.645
Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Tzu,
I apologize sincerely.

06:42.647 --> 06:44.180
Okay.

06:44.182 --> 06:45.515
No match.

06:45.517 --> 06:47.117
I'm sorry.

06:47.119 --> 06:49.219
It's all right, it happens.

06:49.221 --> 06:52.555
Oh, you're getting
a text from Lauren.

06:52.557 --> 06:54.391
Uh-huh.

06:54.393 --> 06:56.359
Oh, dear, I gotta split.

06:56.361 --> 06:57.494
Lemme guess.

06:57.496 --> 06:59.529
- Lauren.
- Mm-hmm.

06:59.531 --> 07:00.530
She's another
match I'm guessing?

07:00.532 --> 07:03.033
That is correct.

07:03.035 --> 07:04.367
What happened to the last one?

07:04.369 --> 07:06.469
- What last one?
- Uh, wow.

07:06.471 --> 07:08.338
I guess it's hard to
keep track of both.

07:08.340 --> 07:10.340
I don't know her name,
the last one you saw.

07:10.342 --> 07:11.708
Is that what you
do, you go see them?

07:11.710 --> 07:14.444
- Oh, you mean Rachel.
- Rachel, Rachel.

07:14.446 --> 07:16.346
Yes, she's cool.
Yeah, we had fun.

07:16.348 --> 07:18.715
I just didn't get
the girlfriend vibe.

07:18.717 --> 07:20.717
Oh, okay, what's
the girlfriend vibe?

07:20.719 --> 07:22.719
Well, you know how you felt
when you first met Lydia?

07:22.721 --> 07:23.787
Yeah?

07:23.789 --> 07:26.589
Yeah, well, I felt, not that.

07:27.591 --> 07:29.259
Okay, yeah, I see.

07:30.561 --> 07:32.095
Oh, there she is.

07:32.097 --> 07:33.163
Wait, you had her come here?

07:33.165 --> 07:34.497
Yeah, so?

07:34.499 --> 07:36.232
Dude, I thought we
were gonna part ways.

07:36.234 --> 07:37.634
We are.

07:37.636 --> 07:39.769
I'm gonna go to that
table over there.

07:39.771 --> 07:41.638
You're ridiculous.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.207
Hey!

07:44.209 --> 07:45.608
I'm Harris.

07:45.610 --> 07:47.610
This is for you.
Thank you.

07:47.612 --> 07:48.612
Jeez.

07:49.380 --> 07:50.246
Can I get you a drink?

07:50.248 --> 07:51.114
Sure!

07:51.116 --> 07:52.649
Wait, let me guess.

08:26.651 --> 08:28.184
Well, hello.

08:37.261 --> 08:39.462
- 'Sup?
- Yo.

08:39.464 --> 08:41.563
Who is that?

08:41.566 --> 08:44.167
Girl I matched with.

08:44.169 --> 08:46.903
Seems to be really into
Sonic the Hedgehog.

08:46.905 --> 08:48.671
Listen, um, can
you do me a favor?

08:48.673 --> 08:50.173
What's that?

08:50.175 --> 08:52.609
Can we swap dicks
just for tonight?

09:07.625 --> 09:09.359
- Guess who?
- Whoa!

09:09.361 --> 09:10.360
Gotcha.

09:10.362 --> 09:11.227
Scared the shit out of me.

09:11.229 --> 09:12.595
Whoops!

09:12.597 --> 09:13.696
You know how to
make an intro, huh?

09:13.698 --> 09:15.665
I tend to just go for the hug.

09:15.667 --> 09:17.500
Is this for me?

09:17.502 --> 09:19.469
Uh, yes, actually.

09:19.471 --> 09:21.604
It's kind of cheesy, but.

09:21.606 --> 09:23.573
Very sweet of you.

09:23.575 --> 09:24.674
Hey there.

09:24.676 --> 09:25.542
- Hi.
- What can I do for you?

09:25.544 --> 09:26.743
Uh, can I get a...

09:26.745 --> 09:28.778
Wait, wait, wait, let me guess.

09:28.780 --> 09:31.881
I'm seeing, red.

09:31.883 --> 09:34.517
Uh, vodka cranberry.

09:34.519 --> 09:35.919
Oh, my God, yeah.

09:35.921 --> 09:38.922
Wait, I'm also
seeing tequila shots.

09:38.924 --> 09:40.523
Yeah, I love tequila shots.

09:40.525 --> 09:42.525
All right, here we go.

09:43.794 --> 09:45.628
I like your hair,
it's different.

09:45.630 --> 09:47.230
Oh, yeah, I need
to update my pics.

09:47.232 --> 09:48.665
They're like three weeks old.

09:48.667 --> 09:49.899
No, it's cool.

09:49.901 --> 09:51.734
Can I tell you
something embarrassing?

09:51.736 --> 09:53.203
I'd be offended if you didn't.

09:53.205 --> 09:55.705
When I was a little kid,

09:55.707 --> 09:59.742
I got my hair
bleached like Eminem.

09:59.744 --> 10:01.277
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

10:01.279 --> 10:03.246
Totally.

10:03.248 --> 10:05.381
Take that secret to the grave.

10:05.383 --> 10:06.383
Yeah.

10:07.618 --> 10:08.851
All right, a vodka cranberry.

10:08.853 --> 10:10.553
Tequila shots.

10:10.555 --> 10:12.488
Thank you, sir.

10:12.490 --> 10:13.690
All right.

10:13.692 --> 10:14.924
Down the hatch.

10:17.261 --> 10:18.228
I haven't thought about
some of these games

10:18.230 --> 10:19.796
since I was a little kid.

10:19.798 --> 10:22.498
I mean, I used to be a huge
Sonic fan back in the day.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.500
Oh, my God, are
you fuckin' serious?

10:24.502 --> 10:26.002
Sonic is like my life.

10:26.004 --> 10:27.737
- You don't say?
- Yeah!

10:27.739 --> 10:29.672
I beat the game once,
no cheat codes.

10:29.674 --> 10:31.407
No, I always
thought Chaos Emeralds

10:31.409 --> 10:33.243
would be a great band name.

10:33.245 --> 10:34.777
That's genius.

10:34.779 --> 10:35.779
Shall we?
Yeah.

10:41.452 --> 10:42.819
Oh, my God, I love this song.

10:42.821 --> 10:43.786
What?

10:43.788 --> 10:44.654
Falling Still?

10:44.656 --> 10:45.521
Seriously?

10:45.523 --> 10:46.756
I know these guys.

10:46.758 --> 10:48.524
- Personally.
- No, you don't.

10:48.526 --> 10:51.027
Uh-huh, did the ad
campaign for their new album.

10:51.029 --> 10:52.629
They got a show coming
up, we should go.

10:52.631 --> 10:53.863
I'll get us backstage.

10:53.865 --> 10:55.498
I would fucking love that.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.666
All right.

10:56.668 --> 10:58.835
You know, I knew we'd get along.

10:58.837 --> 11:01.004
I could tell just
from your profile pic.

11:01.006 --> 11:02.438
I knew.

11:02.440 --> 11:03.873
What's your sign?

11:03.875 --> 11:05.508
Uh, Virgo, I think.

11:05.510 --> 11:07.310
Oh, my God!

11:07.312 --> 11:09.879
I'm a Pisces, we're like
the most compatible signs.

11:09.881 --> 11:11.514
Well, what do you know?

11:17.655 --> 11:18.888
Oh, fuck.

11:18.890 --> 11:23.526
- What?
- My ex just liked my post.

11:23.528 --> 11:25.028
I'm sorry?

11:25.030 --> 11:27.030
I think he's just
trying to fuck with me.

11:27.032 --> 11:28.765
By liking your, uh...

11:28.767 --> 11:30.900
I have the best idea.

11:31.769 --> 11:33.036
Uh.

11:33.038 --> 11:34.671
Act like you're
having a good time.

11:34.673 --> 11:35.673
Okay.

11:37.341 --> 11:39.475
Oh, my God, that's great.

11:39.477 --> 11:40.443
You're a good actor.

11:40.445 --> 11:42.078
We make a good team.

12:32.629 --> 12:33.629
Hi.

12:34.365 --> 12:35.498
Hey!

12:35.500 --> 12:36.500
Hey.

12:38.902 --> 12:41.371
I'm just gonna head out, okay?

12:41.373 --> 12:43.740
You don't want to sleep over?

12:43.742 --> 12:48.044
I, I got work tomorrow, so.

12:48.046 --> 12:51.414
Well, you can just leave
from here in the morning.

12:51.416 --> 12:53.816
Venice is kinda far
from where I work.

12:53.818 --> 12:55.852
Plus, I gotta shower.

12:55.854 --> 12:58.955
Well, you could
just shower here.

12:58.957 --> 13:02.892
I could, but, you know, gotta
change and everything, so.

13:02.894 --> 13:05.061
I might have a couple of
shirts you could borrow.

13:05.063 --> 13:06.963
Don't worry, they're
my brother's.

13:06.965 --> 13:09.966
It's just a lot
easier if I go home.

13:12.770 --> 13:14.570
What are you doing tomorrow?

13:14.572 --> 13:15.571
Maybe we could do this again?

13:15.573 --> 13:16.973
Uh, yeah.

13:16.975 --> 13:21.010
Oh, no, I've gotta
work on a pitch, but,

13:21.012 --> 13:23.146
call you as soon as I get free?

13:23.148 --> 13:24.881
Maybe this weekend?

13:27.651 --> 13:29.752
Yeah, maybe.

13:29.754 --> 13:30.820
Okay.

13:30.822 --> 13:32.855
All right.

13:32.857 --> 13:35.057
Sleep well, good night.

13:41.198 --> 13:44.634
Don't gamble with
your car insurance.

13:45.636 --> 13:46.903
Still too long.

13:49.773 --> 13:51.207
We're at a casino.

13:51.209 --> 13:53.609
Blackjack table; we
take a look at our hand.

13:53.611 --> 13:54.744
16, the dreaded.

14:01.685 --> 14:03.119
Oh, Christ, lemme.

14:05.990 --> 14:07.790
We're at a casino.

14:07.792 --> 14:08.792
Blackjack table.

14:12.930 --> 14:13.896
"Hey, what's up?

14:13.898 --> 14:15.131
"What are you doing?"

14:15.133 --> 14:17.834
Trying to work is
what I'm doing.

14:19.136 --> 14:21.237
We're at a casino,
blackjack table.

14:21.239 --> 14:23.940
Jesus fucking Christ.

14:23.942 --> 14:25.641
Okay.

14:27.779 --> 14:29.846
Mm-hmm, shut the fuck up.

14:37.221 --> 14:38.921
We're at a ca... jeez fuck!

14:38.923 --> 14:42.258
I'm gonna kill this
girl if she doesn't.

14:45.229 --> 14:46.229
Well, hello.

14:50.268 --> 14:51.868
I brought wine.

14:53.971 --> 14:56.606
♫ Everyone's a victim

14:56.608 --> 14:59.675
♫ Victim every day

14:59.677 --> 15:02.778
♫ Everyone is looking at me

15:02.780 --> 15:06.015
♫ Don't know what they've heard

15:06.017 --> 15:08.784
♫ Hell no

15:08.786 --> 15:11.053
♫ Hell no

15:45.222 --> 15:46.889
Oh, God.

16:08.245 --> 16:10.146
- Hello?
- Finally!

16:10.148 --> 16:11.180
Dude, are you in the
hospital or something?

16:11.182 --> 16:12.281
Robby?

16:12.283 --> 16:13.149
The hospital?

16:13.151 --> 16:14.784
What are you.

16:14.786 --> 16:16.919
Holy shit, holy fucking shit!

16:16.921 --> 16:18.988
Yeah, dude, you
missed the meeting, man.

16:18.990 --> 16:20.022
Fuck!

16:20.024 --> 16:21.057
God, what happened?

16:21.059 --> 16:22.358
My alarm didn't go off.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.826
Dude, I don't know, man.

16:23.828 --> 16:25.728
You gotta remember
to set that shit.

16:25.730 --> 16:26.762
Oh, fuck, are they still there?

16:26.764 --> 16:28.064
Do I have time to...

16:28.066 --> 16:29.732
They're gone, dude, they left.

16:29.734 --> 16:31.067
Oh, my God, what happened?

16:31.069 --> 16:32.101
Look, everything's fine.

16:32.103 --> 16:33.302
They left totally happy.

16:33.304 --> 16:34.670
They had no idea
anything was wrong.

16:34.672 --> 16:36.138
But how?

16:36.140 --> 16:38.040
Look, we had
to use my pitch, man.

16:38.042 --> 16:40.209
- We didn't have a choice.
- Fuck!

16:40.211 --> 16:42.011
Why didn't you call me,
man, before the pitch?

16:42.013 --> 16:44.013
I literally have
been calling you non-stop.

16:44.015 --> 16:45.181
Why didn't you try again?

16:45.183 --> 16:46.182
I tried, dude.

16:46.184 --> 16:47.750
Well, just forget it.

16:47.752 --> 16:48.851
How's Terri?

16:48.853 --> 16:49.852
What do you think, man?

16:49.854 --> 16:52.221
- She's pissed!
- Fuck!

16:52.223 --> 16:53.923
All right, I'm coming in now.

16:55.859 --> 16:57.026
Where the fuck are my shoes?

16:57.028 --> 16:58.227
Is everything okay?

16:58.229 --> 17:00.896
No, no, everything's not okay.

17:00.898 --> 17:02.398
My alarm didn't go
off or something,

17:02.400 --> 17:04.066
I missed my meeting,
and now I don't even know

17:04.068 --> 17:06.202
if I have a job anymore.

17:06.204 --> 17:07.236
Fuck.

17:07.238 --> 17:08.671
I think.

17:08.673 --> 17:10.839
I think I accidentally
shut it off.

17:10.842 --> 17:12.273
- What?
- It woke me up,

17:12.276 --> 17:17.012
and I sort of just hit the
button and fell asleep.

17:17.015 --> 17:18.114
Why would you do that?

17:18.116 --> 17:19.315
I don't know, reflex I guess.

17:19.317 --> 17:20.683
I am so sorry.

17:21.685 --> 17:23.285
Please don't be mad.

17:23.287 --> 17:25.755
No, no, you know what?
It's fine, it's.

17:25.757 --> 17:27.757
- You drive here?
- I took an Uber.

17:27.759 --> 17:29.859
Harris, I'm really,
really sorry.

17:29.861 --> 17:31.861
No, it's fine, I just, uh.

17:31.863 --> 17:33.262
You know, I have to leave,

17:33.264 --> 17:35.665
I don't have time
to drive you, so.

17:35.667 --> 17:38.167
Of course, I'll get an Uber.

17:42.205 --> 17:45.041
Okay, it's gonna be
here in six minutes.

17:45.043 --> 17:46.142
Have you seen my shirt?

17:46.144 --> 17:47.843
Uh, I can't wait that long.

17:47.845 --> 17:49.245
Just leave me here.

17:49.247 --> 17:53.015
I'll go as soon as
the Uber gets here.

17:53.017 --> 17:54.817
Fine, just lock
up when you leave.

17:54.819 --> 17:56.786
Toss my keys.

17:56.788 --> 17:59.121
Harris, I feel really
shitty about this.

17:59.123 --> 18:00.289
I am so sorry.

18:04.995 --> 18:06.696
- Harris?
- Yeah?

18:06.698 --> 18:09.398
Terri wants to see
you in her office.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.400
Yeah.

18:12.803 --> 18:15.271
You wanna explain what happened?

18:15.273 --> 18:17.440
It was my alarm.

18:17.442 --> 18:19.775
What about it?

18:19.777 --> 18:21.243
I was up late last night

18:21.245 --> 18:23.212
working on the pitch, and
I put my phone on silent

18:23.214 --> 18:24.880
'cause it kept going off,

18:24.882 --> 18:26.482
and when I went to bed
I guess I never turned

18:26.484 --> 18:29.018
the volume back up, so.

18:29.020 --> 18:32.488
When my alarm went off,
I just didn't hear it.

18:33.724 --> 18:35.024
You are aware that they make

18:35.026 --> 18:36.459
actual alarm clocks, right?

18:36.461 --> 18:39.161
I know, it's a
terrible excuse, Terri,

18:39.163 --> 18:41.197
but it's the truth.

18:41.199 --> 18:43.265
You knew how
important today was.

18:43.267 --> 18:44.734
I did.
I'm so sorry.

18:49.005 --> 18:51.307
Do I still have a job?

18:51.309 --> 18:54.844
Yeah, you still
have a job, barely.

18:54.846 --> 18:56.378
But you're off Harry's.

18:56.380 --> 18:59.982
Robby did the pitch,
Robby gets the job.

19:01.318 --> 19:03.319
And I'm gonna need 500 words

19:03.321 --> 19:07.089
on Waldo's Scented
Matches by Friday, got it?

19:09.993 --> 19:11.060
Understood.

19:15.500 --> 19:18.100
- No, I didn't respond.
- Why not?

19:18.102 --> 19:20.269
'Cause she wants
me to lose my job.

19:20.271 --> 19:22.238
What kind of a nut job
shuts off someone's alarm?

19:22.240 --> 19:23.105
Didn't she say
it was an accident?

19:23.107 --> 19:24.940
I don't know.

19:24.942 --> 19:26.275
In my experience, girls who
change their hair all the time

19:26.277 --> 19:28.377
aren't exactly
emotionally stable.

19:28.379 --> 19:30.012
Then why did you see her again?

19:30.014 --> 19:31.547
Dude, come on, serious?

19:31.549 --> 19:33.082
Yeah, okay, look.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.917
I just think that
this could be a sign.

19:34.919 --> 19:36.485
Yeah, man, I'm not so interested

19:36.487 --> 19:38.554
in signs right now,
I kinda just wanna chill out,

19:38.556 --> 19:40.189
play some video games,
and go to bed.

19:40.191 --> 19:42.158
All right, all right,
all right, fine, okay.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.325
Look, I'll let you go,
but can I just give you

19:43.327 --> 19:44.860
one little piece of advice?

19:44.862 --> 19:46.495
One little piece of
advice before I go?

19:46.497 --> 19:48.531
Lay it on me, oh great mystic.

19:48.533 --> 19:52.334
Okay, look, I think
that this may be...

19:52.336 --> 19:54.570
What?
Chuck?

19:54.572 --> 19:56.272
Losing you, Chuck?

20:06.484 --> 20:09.251
♫ I pissed away

20:10.253 --> 20:14.356
♫ Every single day

20:14.358 --> 20:19.261
♫ And all my mistakes,
I take the blame

20:19.263 --> 20:22.264
♫ And it feels okay because

20:22.266 --> 20:24.500
♫ I've never

20:26.203 --> 20:27.203
Hey.

20:28.572 --> 20:30.005
Jesus, Riley.

20:31.074 --> 20:32.374
Why are you still...

20:34.411 --> 20:36.846
You didn't answer my texts.

20:37.848 --> 20:40.015
Uh, yeah, no, I'm sorry.

20:41.284 --> 20:43.552
I should've gotten back to you.

20:45.189 --> 20:47.122
I was just trying to
tell you I was sorry

20:47.124 --> 20:48.390
about this morning.

20:48.392 --> 20:50.392
Yeah, sure, yeah, of course.

20:50.394 --> 20:52.294
Just relax, okay?

20:52.296 --> 20:55.197
There's no reason for
anyone to get hurt.

20:55.199 --> 20:56.199
Hurt?

20:59.236 --> 21:00.502
This?

21:00.504 --> 21:03.472
Oh, my God, I'm cooking dinner.

21:03.474 --> 21:05.608
I'm making chicken stir fry.

21:08.511 --> 21:10.479
I felt so bad about today,

21:10.481 --> 21:12.014
and I wanted to
make it up to you,

21:12.016 --> 21:13.115
so I thought I'd
do something nice

21:13.117 --> 21:14.416
and cook you dinner.

21:14.418 --> 21:15.985
So you broke into my apartment?

21:15.987 --> 21:17.519
No!

21:17.521 --> 21:19.221
Actually, I never
really left except

21:19.223 --> 21:20.522
for when I went
to go buy groceries.

21:20.524 --> 21:21.924
But, you know.

21:21.926 --> 21:24.627
You could've told me, Riley.

21:24.629 --> 21:28.197
I tried, but you
didn't text me back.

21:28.199 --> 21:31.667
Plus, I thought it would
be a nice surprise.

21:36.106 --> 21:38.073
This was a bad idea, wasn't it?

21:38.075 --> 21:39.075
Uh, no.

21:40.677 --> 21:43.345
- You think I'm crazy.
- No, I don't.

21:43.347 --> 21:46.916
Ill-advised maybe.

21:46.918 --> 21:48.250
I just, I already ate, and I got

21:48.252 --> 21:49.251
- a bunch of work to do.
- Consider me gone.

21:49.253 --> 21:51.587
This was almost done anyway.

21:55.025 --> 21:57.293
But it smells amazing.

21:57.295 --> 21:59.128
So, tell you what,

21:59.130 --> 22:02.164
I will have it for
lunch tomorrow.

22:03.533 --> 22:05.334
Really?

22:05.336 --> 22:08.570
So this wasn't like
deal-breaker stuff?

22:08.572 --> 22:11.206
No!
Come on.

22:11.208 --> 22:13.642
What's a little breaking and
entering between friends, huh?

22:16.047 --> 22:17.546
Good.

22:17.548 --> 22:21.083
'Cause I think I might
like you, Harris.

22:22.986 --> 22:25.354
I think I might like you too.

22:27.190 --> 22:29.024
Okay, let me get
out of your hair.

22:29.026 --> 22:32.394
I'll just get my stuff,
and good luck with work.

22:32.396 --> 22:34.630
Uh, I'll text you later?

22:36.166 --> 22:37.166
Okay, bye.

22:52.216 --> 22:55.184
I think I might like you.

22:55.186 --> 22:57.386
To never talk to me again.

23:00.623 --> 23:02.057
Hey, Shadow, is it
possible you got worse

23:02.059 --> 23:03.625
since we last played?

23:03.627 --> 23:05.060
I've been busy.

23:05.062 --> 23:07.096
Let me guess, fucking my mom?

23:07.098 --> 23:09.531
No, fucking your sister!

23:11.435 --> 23:13.235
You have, like,
other insults, right?

23:13.237 --> 23:14.570
Creative ones?

23:14.572 --> 23:17.106
Suck my dick.

23:22.345 --> 23:23.412
"Hi, baby, how are you?

23:23.414 --> 23:25.347
"What are you doing?"

23:29.319 --> 23:31.020
Oh, there he goes.

23:37.660 --> 23:38.727
Gotta be kidding me.

23:38.729 --> 23:40.162
What's the matter?

23:40.164 --> 23:41.563
Don't like getting
your ass kicked?

23:41.565 --> 23:43.265
I wasn't talking
to you, ShadowMan.

23:43.267 --> 23:44.366
Yeah, right.

23:44.368 --> 23:46.335
Actually dealing with a girl!

23:46.337 --> 23:47.669
Ever had a girlfriend before?

23:47.671 --> 23:49.171
Yeah!

23:49.173 --> 23:50.039
I'm not talking
about the body pillow

23:50.041 --> 23:51.473
you sleep with at night,

23:51.475 --> 23:53.375
I'm talking about a
real live human girl.

23:53.377 --> 23:54.243
I don't have a body pillow.

23:54.245 --> 23:55.677
You should get one.

23:55.679 --> 23:57.479
It's gonna be a long
time before any girl

23:57.481 --> 24:01.350
not stuffed with goose down
wants to sleep with you, so.

24:01.352 --> 24:03.519
Wait, Shadow, you.

24:03.521 --> 24:04.521
Oh, he quit?

24:06.256 --> 24:08.090
Well.

24:08.092 --> 24:10.225
Guess he had enough.

24:16.633 --> 24:18.233
Hey.

24:18.235 --> 24:19.234
I'm gonna go down to
the shooting stage

24:19.236 --> 24:20.269
if you wanna roll.

24:20.271 --> 24:22.271
Uh-huh, yeah, one sec.

24:25.442 --> 24:27.543
Is that that girl again?

24:27.545 --> 24:29.278
Fourth time today,
it's not even noon.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.245
Maybe it's important.

24:30.247 --> 24:32.147
Trust me, it's not.

24:32.149 --> 24:33.649
- Uh, Harris?
- Yeah?

24:33.651 --> 24:34.750
I've got a call for you.

24:34.752 --> 24:35.751
Can you take a message?

24:35.753 --> 24:37.386
Uh, well, it's your mom.

24:37.388 --> 24:38.620
She said it's urgent.

24:38.622 --> 24:39.622
My mom?

24:40.824 --> 24:42.424
Should call my cell.

24:42.426 --> 24:45.561
Dude, I'm right behind you.

24:45.563 --> 24:47.496
- Mom?
- Harris.

24:47.498 --> 24:50.265
- Mom, is that you?
- There's been an accident.

24:50.267 --> 24:54.203
- Mom, you sound kinda...
- I peed my pants.

24:54.205 --> 24:55.637
Who is?

24:55.639 --> 24:57.473
- Riley?
- Got you!

24:57.475 --> 24:59.441
- How'd you get this number?
- Online!

24:59.443 --> 25:01.410
You weren't answering your cell.
So I just figured...

25:01.412 --> 25:02.878
I wasn't answering my
cell 'cause I'm at work.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.346
Look, I have to go,
they're shooting a spot,

25:04.348 --> 25:05.447
- I'm gonna be late.
- Just a second.

25:05.449 --> 25:06.715
It's important.

25:06.717 --> 25:08.350
Fine, what is it?

25:08.352 --> 25:11.420
The Falling
Still concert is tonight.

25:11.422 --> 25:12.855
You called me at my
office to see if I want

25:12.857 --> 25:14.790
to go to a concert with you?

25:14.792 --> 25:16.158
Well, you said
that you would take me

25:16.160 --> 25:17.693
when they come to town.

25:17.695 --> 25:19.128
Yeah, you know what,
it's kind of short notice.

25:19.130 --> 25:20.496
Look, Riley, I've
gotta go, okay?

25:20.498 --> 25:21.663
Maybe we could
do something else then?

25:21.665 --> 25:24.366
Like, dinner and a movie?

25:24.368 --> 25:25.400
Yeah, you know what,
I think I'm just

25:25.402 --> 25:27.369
gonna take it easy tonight, so.

25:27.371 --> 25:30.205
So, maybe
just Netflix and chill?

25:30.207 --> 25:31.507
I could bring wine?

25:31.509 --> 25:33.142
Yeah, I'm not feeling so great.

25:34.712 --> 25:37.846
So I'm just gonna stay
home and get to bed early,

25:37.848 --> 25:38.914
but we'll hang out soon.

25:38.916 --> 25:41.383
- Okay?
- Okay.

25:41.385 --> 25:42.451
- Feel better.
- Okay, I will.

25:42.453 --> 25:43.453
Thank you.

25:46.356 --> 25:47.422
Oh, shit.

26:04.474 --> 26:06.775
What the fuck, guy?

26:06.777 --> 26:09.478
Sorry, everyone.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.513
All right, let's go again.

26:13.250 --> 26:13.916
It's called oil pulling.

26:13.918 --> 26:15.417
Oil pulling?

26:15.419 --> 26:17.352
Yeah, you swish
coconut oil in your mouth

26:17.354 --> 26:18.787
for 10 minutes every day.

26:18.789 --> 26:20.589
It's supposed to be
really good for you.

26:20.591 --> 26:22.457
Yeah, I don't see how
that could possibly be true.

26:22.459 --> 26:23.459
It's true!

26:27.830 --> 26:29.264
Uh-huh.

26:29.266 --> 26:30.766
See, it says right here:

26:30.768 --> 26:34.269
"Swishing with coconut oil
for 10 minutes every day

26:34.271 --> 26:36.872
"will strengthen gum and
help fight tooth decay."

26:36.874 --> 26:39.408
Yeah, okay, but look
at the name of the site.

26:39.410 --> 26:41.543
It's althealth.net.

26:41.545 --> 26:43.312
All right, that doesn't
sound like the most

26:43.314 --> 26:45.447
reputable site to me,
I'm sorry, it's true.

26:45.449 --> 26:46.582
Yeah, but look at the comments.

26:46.584 --> 26:47.749
Everyone says it works.

26:47.751 --> 26:49.818
Comments?
Anyone can write.

26:49.820 --> 26:51.720
I have an article
right here which says

26:51.722 --> 26:56.391
that oil pulling has no
proven effect on oral health.

26:56.393 --> 26:57.492
Oh, yeah?

26:57.494 --> 26:59.261
And what site is that?

26:59.263 --> 27:00.462
Healthdaddy.com.

27:00.464 --> 27:01.730
Oh, my God, yeah.
Totally better.

27:01.732 --> 27:03.432
- Most trustworthy source.
- What?

27:03.434 --> 27:04.833
It's...

27:04.835 --> 27:05.801
Oh, my god, you've
gotta be kidding me.

27:05.803 --> 27:07.002
What's up?

27:07.004 --> 27:08.570
It's this girl, she's obsessed.

27:08.572 --> 27:09.905
I mean, she's certifiable.

27:09.907 --> 27:11.440
I'm just glad I
don't have any pets.

27:11.442 --> 27:13.775
- Oh, come on.
- I'm serious!

27:13.777 --> 27:15.444
Man, okay.

27:15.446 --> 27:17.012
She called me today.

27:17.014 --> 27:18.780
No!

27:18.782 --> 27:20.682
She is insane!

27:20.684 --> 27:22.651
Did she use a landline?

27:22.653 --> 27:24.453
Arm yourself, Harris.

27:24.455 --> 27:25.687
This is all a joke
to you guys now,

27:25.689 --> 27:26.788
but when I'm found dead,

27:26.790 --> 27:27.789
I hope you think about this,

27:27.791 --> 27:30.259
and it makes you very, very sad.

27:30.261 --> 27:31.660
Okay, Harris, I'll bite.

27:31.662 --> 27:33.495
How can we help you?

27:33.497 --> 27:35.364
I wish I knew.

27:35.366 --> 27:37.299
Here's an idea.

27:37.301 --> 27:39.434
Stop fucking every
girl you meet online.

27:39.436 --> 27:40.902
I'm serious!

27:40.904 --> 27:42.004
This girl, what's her name?

27:42.006 --> 27:43.872
- Riley.
- Riley.

27:43.874 --> 27:45.707
Did you ever actually
wanna date Riley?

27:45.709 --> 27:47.476
Or did you just use
her because you thought

27:47.478 --> 27:48.577
she'd be an easy lay?

27:48.579 --> 27:50.479
Okay, I didn't use anybody.

27:50.481 --> 27:51.780
Mm-hmm.

27:51.782 --> 27:53.582
Correct me if I'm wrong,

27:53.584 --> 27:55.484
but the order of
events seems to be

27:55.486 --> 27:58.420
you met her, you fucked
her, you ignored her.

27:58.422 --> 28:01.556
What does that
sound like to you?

28:01.558 --> 28:03.825
Chuck, a little help?

28:03.827 --> 28:06.862
Uh, yeah, uh, look.

28:06.864 --> 28:10.632
I think that she
has a point, Harris.

28:10.634 --> 28:12.067
I mean, look, it doesn't
seem like you want

28:12.069 --> 28:13.635
anything more from these girls

28:13.637 --> 28:15.637
other than to just,
you know, have sex.

28:15.639 --> 28:17.439
Okay, okay, 'cause
you two have been

28:17.441 --> 28:18.740
out of the game for so long,

28:18.742 --> 28:20.609
let me give you a
little refresher.

28:20.611 --> 28:22.611
Nobody is doing this shit

28:22.613 --> 28:24.513
because they're in
search of true love.

28:24.515 --> 28:26.782
They may say they are,
but they're lying.

28:26.784 --> 28:29.484
- And what do they want?
- They want to meet someone,

28:29.486 --> 28:32.821
get laid, and bring their boring
lives a little excitement.

28:32.823 --> 28:34.723
It's like going to a
bar on a Friday night

28:34.725 --> 28:37.526
minus everything that sucks
about a bar on a Friday night.

28:37.528 --> 28:40.429
Or maybe that's what you want.

28:40.431 --> 28:41.963
Ever thought about that?

28:41.965 --> 28:44.900
Or were you just too busy
thinking about yourself?

28:44.902 --> 28:45.902
Okay.

28:47.036 --> 28:49.004
You know what?

28:49.006 --> 28:50.706
You're right.

28:50.708 --> 28:52.574
I screwed up, I admit it.

28:52.576 --> 28:54.009
Thank you!

28:54.011 --> 28:57.646
I screwed up by being
a slave to my genitals

28:57.648 --> 29:00.816
and sleeping with the
same lunatic twice

29:00.818 --> 29:03.051
against my better judgment.

29:03.053 --> 29:05.120
- Harris?
- Riley?

29:07.390 --> 29:09.558
I thought you
said you were sick.

29:09.560 --> 29:12.027
Uh, how long have you
been standing there?

29:12.029 --> 29:13.862
Who's Lydia?

29:15.465 --> 29:16.598
Okay, uh, you know what?

29:16.600 --> 29:18.533
We should step outside.

29:18.535 --> 29:20.068
How did you know where I was?

29:20.070 --> 29:22.704
Some girl named Lydia
checked you in on Facebook.

29:22.706 --> 29:24.973
Who is she?

29:24.975 --> 29:27.809
Um, Lydia is my best
friend's girlfriend.

29:27.811 --> 29:30.579
Chuck, Lydia, this is Riley.

29:30.581 --> 29:31.581
- Hey.
- Hi.

29:32.715 --> 29:34.616
So you're not sick?

29:34.618 --> 29:36.451
Uh, I was feeling,

29:36.453 --> 29:37.986
but, you know, I
kind of felt better...

29:37.988 --> 29:41.156
Oh, God, just stop it, Harris.

29:41.158 --> 29:42.824
You think because
I'm some lunatic

29:42.826 --> 29:45.560
you can lie to me
and I'll believe you?

29:45.562 --> 29:46.728
Heard that, huh?

29:46.730 --> 29:48.063
You said you liked me.

29:48.065 --> 29:50.665
Yeah, yeah,
totally, you're great.

29:50.667 --> 29:53.435
You don't give a
shit about me, do you?

29:53.437 --> 29:55.737
You just wanted to make
your boring, little life

29:55.739 --> 29:58.573
a little more exciting,
is that it?

29:58.575 --> 30:00.409
Or was it my life
that was boring?

30:00.411 --> 30:02.043
Okay, can we just,
can we just calm down?

30:02.045 --> 30:03.478
You think I'm just some fuck toy

30:03.480 --> 30:04.713
you can have your way with

30:04.715 --> 30:06.615
and never call again,
is that it?

30:06.617 --> 30:08.083
Whoa, just relax, all right?

30:08.085 --> 30:09.451
I never meant to
hurt your feelings.

30:09.453 --> 30:11.586
Oh, I'm sure you didn't.

30:11.588 --> 30:13.155
I'm sure you never thought
about my feelings at all,

30:13.157 --> 30:14.723
did you?

30:14.725 --> 30:16.725
Did you, you fucking
piece of shit?

30:16.727 --> 30:18.593
You fucking asshole.

30:19.695 --> 30:20.796
Riley!

30:20.798 --> 30:23.698
You can fuck off
and die, Harris.

30:27.437 --> 30:28.804
Way to go, Lydia.

30:33.776 --> 30:35.010
Sorry.

31:27.196 --> 31:28.196
Hello?

31:37.840 --> 31:41.576
If anybody's in here,
I'm calling the police.

31:53.990 --> 31:54.990
Hello?

31:57.660 --> 31:59.261
We were supposed
to be together forever.

31:59.263 --> 32:00.795
Riley?

32:00.797 --> 32:02.597
If I can't have you, no one can.

33:25.715 --> 33:26.815
That's why it's good to
have a good woman

33:26.817 --> 33:28.617
to go home to, you know?

33:28.619 --> 33:29.651
Someone who could rub your feet.

33:29.653 --> 33:31.219
Oh, shut up.

33:31.221 --> 33:33.121
All right, man, I'll see you.

33:33.123 --> 33:36.057
Yeah, dude,
my keys are in your pack.

33:36.059 --> 33:38.193
Oh, yeah.

33:38.195 --> 33:40.028
I guess you will
be needing those.

33:40.030 --> 33:41.796
I will be needing those.

33:41.798 --> 33:42.831
Keys.

33:42.833 --> 33:45.033
Mm-hmm, thank you.

33:45.035 --> 33:46.835
So, I mean do
you want this phone or...

33:46.837 --> 33:48.937
Ah, you can
keep that, that's fine.

33:48.939 --> 33:50.872
All right, man, I'll see you.

33:50.874 --> 33:53.108
All right, see you, man.

33:53.110 --> 33:54.676
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

33:54.678 --> 33:56.111
What?

33:56.113 --> 33:57.812
Riley, she's still harassing me.

33:57.814 --> 33:59.114
She was texting me the whole
time we were up hiking.

33:59.116 --> 34:01.082
Whoa, what she say?

34:01.084 --> 34:02.917
I don't know,
man, I'm not gonna read 'em.

34:02.919 --> 34:05.020
I'm gonna delete 'em, gonna
block her, and move on.

34:05.022 --> 34:06.187
Oh, no, no, no, come on, man.

34:06.189 --> 34:07.155
It's not like you gotta respond.

34:07.157 --> 34:08.322
Hey, hey, I'm curious.

34:08.324 --> 34:09.391
- Oh, you're curious?
- Yeah.

34:09.393 --> 34:11.126
Please, go right ahead.

34:11.128 --> 34:13.194
Have fun, just delete
'em when you're done.

34:13.196 --> 34:16.164
This is like
the highlight of my life.

34:16.166 --> 34:17.732
She says Bye.

34:17.734 --> 34:19.868
Oh, well, finally, she gets it.

34:19.870 --> 34:20.935
Bye!

34:23.139 --> 34:26.074
Whoa.

34:26.076 --> 34:27.909
Whoa, you might
wanna look at this.

34:27.911 --> 34:29.411
Dude, I
honestly just don't care.

34:29.413 --> 34:31.045
No, no, no, Harris.

34:31.047 --> 34:32.047
I'm serious.

34:33.014 --> 34:34.849
What the fuck?

34:34.851 --> 34:36.717
She's not trying
to say she's gonna,

34:36.719 --> 34:38.353
she's gonna kill herself?

34:38.355 --> 34:40.121
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

34:40.123 --> 34:42.123
Oh, come on, this
is just fucking ridiculous, no.

34:42.125 --> 34:43.358
Whoa, whoa,
you're not concerned?

34:43.360 --> 34:44.926
No, man!
Why should I be?

34:44.928 --> 34:46.460
She's just trying
to get my attention.

34:46.463 --> 34:47.395
Okay, that
doesn't mean she's lying.

34:47.397 --> 34:48.862
Dude, come on.

34:48.864 --> 34:51.366
Who sends a suicide
note by text?

34:51.368 --> 34:53.935
Well, I read
about this woman in Taiwan

34:53.937 --> 34:55.937
who live streamed her suicide.

34:55.938 --> 34:58.239
This stuff happens.

34:58.241 --> 35:00.308
Hey.

35:00.310 --> 35:04.345
- What, there's more, right?
- There's a video.

35:04.347 --> 35:05.780
Okay.

35:09.885 --> 35:11.386
- Oh, wow.
- What the fuck?

35:11.388 --> 35:13.221
No, no, no, I mean, come on.

35:13.223 --> 35:15.123
Say this is real, what the fuck
am I supposed to do about it?

35:15.125 --> 35:16.491
- You gotta help her.
- Help her?

35:16.493 --> 35:18.193
She's not my
responsibility, man!

35:18.195 --> 35:19.728
Come on, you
can't be serious, Harris.

35:19.730 --> 35:22.731
Fuck, just, fuck!

35:22.733 --> 35:24.199
Look, just call 911.

35:24.201 --> 35:25.934
I'm not calling 911, man.

35:25.936 --> 35:26.901
This is a fucking prank...

35:26.903 --> 35:28.169
No, then call her.

35:28.171 --> 35:29.771
No, that's what she wants.

35:29.773 --> 35:31.106
That's exactly what
she wants me to do.

35:31.108 --> 35:32.974
Okay, so let
her die, let her die

35:32.976 --> 35:34.109
just so you don't
have to see her again.

35:34.111 --> 35:35.176
No one's gonna die!

35:35.178 --> 35:36.745
This is a fuck!

35:36.747 --> 35:38.513
You know what, fine.
You know what?

35:38.515 --> 35:40.915
I'll call her and you'll see.

35:41.984 --> 35:43.752
It's ringing.

35:43.754 --> 35:45.153
- Harris?
- Riley?

35:45.155 --> 35:46.521
Stop messing around.

35:46.523 --> 35:48.022
Harris, is that you?

35:48.024 --> 35:49.124
Yes, you got me to call.

35:49.126 --> 35:50.258
Now, Riley, just stop.

35:50.260 --> 35:52.127
I'm tired.

35:52.129 --> 35:54.462
Riley, stop messing around.

35:54.464 --> 35:57.432
I just wanted to
hear your voice one last time.

35:57.434 --> 35:59.367
Riley, please, come
on, just stop it,

35:59.369 --> 36:00.835
it's not funny.

36:02.171 --> 36:04.005
Riley?
Riley?

36:06.108 --> 36:07.809
Riley, is this for real?

36:07.811 --> 36:09.944
- Bye, Harris.
- No, wait, wait.

36:09.946 --> 36:13.047
Riley, what did you take
and when did you take it?

36:13.049 --> 36:15.183
Pills.

36:15.185 --> 36:19.020
Pills from my dad's back
surgeries, and whiskey...

36:19.022 --> 36:20.255
All right, Riley,
stay where you are.

36:20.257 --> 36:22.023
I'm gonna call 9-1-1.

36:22.025 --> 36:23.792
No.

36:23.794 --> 36:24.959
Riley, I'm calling
the ambulance.

36:24.961 --> 36:27.028
What's your address?

36:27.030 --> 36:29.531
No ambulance, you come.

36:29.533 --> 36:31.800
Fine, fine.
I'll come.

36:31.802 --> 36:34.035
Riley, what's your address?

36:36.038 --> 36:39.073
Riley, Riley, talk to me!

36:39.075 --> 36:42.577
1738 Palm Drive, apartment four.

36:43.479 --> 36:46.080
Okay, I'm coming.

36:46.082 --> 36:47.315
All right, man, I gotta go.

36:47.317 --> 36:48.550
- All right.
- I'll call you!

36:48.552 --> 36:51.085
- Yeah, let me know.
- Yeah.

36:59.028 --> 37:00.261
Riley!

37:00.263 --> 37:01.263
Riley!

37:02.298 --> 37:04.232
Where the fuck are you?

37:06.135 --> 37:07.836
Riley, talk to me.

37:09.538 --> 37:10.538
Fuck!

37:14.376 --> 37:16.010
Riley?

37:16.012 --> 37:17.178
Riley, please.

37:21.183 --> 37:22.584
Oh, my God.

37:22.586 --> 37:23.586
Oh, shit.

37:24.386 --> 37:25.553
What the fuck?

37:26.488 --> 37:28.056
Come on, come on.

37:28.058 --> 37:30.225
Where's the fucking pulse?

37:33.963 --> 37:36.064
Oh, thank God, come on.

37:36.066 --> 37:39.500
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on!

37:39.502 --> 37:41.069
Come on, fucking come on.

37:41.071 --> 37:42.151
Come on, Riley, think of...

37:43.473 --> 37:45.139
What the fuck?

37:45.141 --> 37:46.141
Gotcha.

37:47.276 --> 37:48.376
You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

37:48.378 --> 37:50.578
This is a prank?

37:50.580 --> 37:52.313
Yeah, a fucking good one.

37:55.185 --> 37:57.185
You should see your
face right now.

37:57.187 --> 37:59.020
How does it feel, Harris?

37:59.022 --> 38:01.122
To be made a fool of.

38:01.124 --> 38:02.124
Shitty?

38:03.226 --> 38:04.626
What the fuck is wrong with you?

38:04.628 --> 38:06.060
You're a fucking psycho, Riley.

38:06.062 --> 38:07.962
Never contact me again.

38:13.136 --> 38:14.168
Fuck!

38:32.421 --> 38:34.188
Dude, what happened
to your hand?

38:34.190 --> 38:35.623
Fuck, just, um, nothing.

38:35.625 --> 38:36.491
Just cut it.

38:36.493 --> 38:37.558
How?

38:37.560 --> 38:38.526
Cooking.

38:38.528 --> 38:40.128
You cook?

38:40.130 --> 38:41.529
Dude, you goose, I
didn't know you cooked.

38:41.531 --> 38:42.664
What'd you make?

38:42.666 --> 38:44.232
Dude, don't you have work to do?

38:44.234 --> 38:45.166
Harris!

38:45.168 --> 38:47.669
Man, I was just asking.

38:47.671 --> 38:51.272
I need to see you in
my office right now.

38:53.676 --> 38:56.277
- Would you, please?
- All right.

38:59.683 --> 39:01.215
Shut the door.

39:06.055 --> 39:08.256
Have a seat.

39:08.258 --> 39:09.691
You're in charge of the
CCG Twitter account, right?

39:09.693 --> 39:11.326
Yeah.

39:11.328 --> 39:14.062
You sent out a series
of tweets last night.

39:14.064 --> 39:15.296
Series of tweets?

39:15.298 --> 39:16.298
Uh.

39:17.399 --> 39:18.566
Okay.

39:18.568 --> 39:20.301
"This company is retarded."

39:20.303 --> 39:22.236
"My co-workers are retarded."

39:22.238 --> 39:24.739
"My boss is retarded."

39:24.741 --> 39:28.009
"I'm sick of working
around so many retards."

39:28.011 --> 39:29.143
And it goes on like this.

39:29.145 --> 39:31.312
You want me to keep going?

39:32.514 --> 39:33.681
Is this a joke?

39:33.683 --> 39:36.217
I don't know, you tell me.

39:37.252 --> 39:39.754
No?

39:39.756 --> 39:42.623
I'm sorry, Terri, I'm
very confused right now.

39:42.625 --> 39:44.525
Me too.

39:44.527 --> 39:46.594
You don't actually
think I wrote those?

39:46.596 --> 39:48.096
The tweets came
from your account.

39:48.098 --> 39:49.097
Yeah, but I didn't write them.

39:49.099 --> 39:50.398
Then who was it?

39:53.002 --> 39:54.602
Riley.

39:54.604 --> 39:56.037
You gotta be shitting me.

39:56.039 --> 39:58.172
- Excuse me?
- No, sorry, not you.

39:58.174 --> 40:01.776
Uh, I know who's responsible
for this, I can fix it.

40:01.778 --> 40:05.179
Even if you didn't write them,
it's not quite that simple.

40:05.181 --> 40:06.581
What do you mean?

40:11.553 --> 40:12.553
Shit.

40:14.256 --> 40:15.289
Are you all right, man?

40:15.291 --> 40:16.524
Yeah, I'm fine.

40:18.093 --> 40:18.793
I can help you.

40:18.795 --> 40:20.228
Will you, shit!

40:22.431 --> 40:23.498
Just fuck it.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.768
Don't you want your stuff?

40:40.183 --> 40:41.082
Hi, you've
reached Riley's phone.

40:41.084 --> 40:41.749
Goddammit!

40:41.751 --> 40:43.117
Riley!

40:43.119 --> 40:44.119
Fuck.

40:48.558 --> 40:50.058
Hi, you've
reached Riley's phone.

40:50.060 --> 40:51.392
Leave a message after the beep

40:51.394 --> 40:54.228
or just be a normal
person and text me.

40:54.230 --> 40:56.464
Enough is enough, Riley,
you have to call me back.

40:56.466 --> 40:58.166
This isn't a fucking
joke anymore.

40:58.168 --> 40:59.534
Call me back, now!

41:13.183 --> 41:14.482
Riley?

41:14.484 --> 41:16.417
This is credit card services.

41:16.419 --> 41:17.419
Goddammit!

41:32.534 --> 41:33.701
Just a minute!

41:43.545 --> 41:45.813
- You Harris Kroller?
- Yeah.

41:45.815 --> 41:48.349
We have a court order
to search the premises.

41:48.351 --> 41:49.450
What do you mean, like
a... like a search warrant?

41:49.452 --> 41:50.785
What?

41:50.787 --> 41:51.752
Yeah, exactly,
where's your computer?

41:51.754 --> 41:53.254
Uh, it's right there.

41:53.256 --> 41:54.288
What the, what the
fuck are you doing?

41:54.290 --> 41:55.823
Guys, could you just...

41:55.825 --> 41:57.391
You want to tell Detective
Rich where your laptop is?

41:57.393 --> 41:58.593
I know you got a laptop.

41:58.595 --> 41:59.760
Well, guys, what
is going on here?

41:59.762 --> 42:01.395
I'm sorry, but.

42:01.397 --> 42:03.464
What's going on is
we need to have a look

42:03.466 --> 42:05.500
at your computer, your laptop,
your telephone, your Xbox,

42:05.502 --> 42:07.168
anything you had access
to the internet with.

42:07.170 --> 42:08.703
What, why?

42:08.705 --> 42:09.570
Why don't
you hand me that bottle

42:09.572 --> 42:11.706
you got there.

42:11.708 --> 42:14.642
Listen, just take a seat,
take a seat, relax.

42:17.847 --> 42:19.714
Look, where's the laptop,
just tell us.

42:19.716 --> 42:21.516
You know we can legally tear
this place apart from top...

42:21.518 --> 42:23.584
It is in the bedroom, I think.

42:23.586 --> 42:24.852
I don't.

42:24.854 --> 42:27.321
Could you?
What the fuck?

42:34.663 --> 42:37.431
Wait, wait, possession
of child pornography?

42:37.433 --> 42:38.799
- What?
- Got it.

42:38.801 --> 42:40.468
No, this has to be some
kind of giant mistake.

42:40.470 --> 42:42.270
I don't have any child porn.

42:42.272 --> 42:43.504
Yeah, well, an IP address

42:43.506 --> 42:45.339
matching the one
from this apartment

42:45.341 --> 42:47.175
was flagged last
night for downloading

42:47.177 --> 42:48.609
over five gigabytes
of illegal data

42:48.611 --> 42:50.411
from servers that
we monitor, so.

42:50.413 --> 42:52.280
But, no, I didn't download
any child porn last night.

42:52.282 --> 42:54.916
I got drunk and fell asleep
on my couch, that's it.

42:54.918 --> 42:57.351
So you were here last night?

42:57.353 --> 42:58.719
- Yeah, but...
- Found it.

42:58.721 --> 43:00.421
In a folder marked Private.

43:00.423 --> 43:02.190
No, that's impossible.
You're lying.

43:02.192 --> 43:04.358
Hey, take it easy.
You're under arrest.

43:04.360 --> 43:06.561
You're under arrest for the
possession of child pornography.

43:06.563 --> 43:07.929
You have the right
to remain silent.

43:07.931 --> 43:10.765
I would recommend
that you use it.

43:19.841 --> 43:21.242
Okay.

43:21.244 --> 43:22.410
Hello.

43:22.412 --> 43:24.512
You are Harris Kroller?

43:25.414 --> 43:26.447
Phew.

43:30.953 --> 43:33.821
My name is Ronald Dale
and I will be your lawyer.

43:33.823 --> 43:35.523
I took a look at your case,
you got a clean record,

43:35.525 --> 43:37.258
which is good.

43:37.260 --> 43:39.894
So, if we plead guilty...
I didn't do anything.

43:39.896 --> 43:41.629
I'm being set up.

43:41.631 --> 43:42.830
By whom?

43:42.832 --> 43:45.766
A girl, her name
is Riley Miller.

43:45.768 --> 43:47.468
Or, I don't know, that
could be a lie too,

43:47.470 --> 43:48.836
come to think of it.

43:48.838 --> 43:50.338
You don't know her name?

43:50.340 --> 43:51.739
I know her address.

43:51.741 --> 43:53.507
She's your ex-girlfriend?

43:53.509 --> 43:55.643
No, that crazy bitch?
No fuckin' way.

43:55.645 --> 43:56.911
Met her online and now she
wants revenge or something.

43:56.913 --> 43:59.347
- What for?
- I don't know.

43:59.349 --> 44:01.415
For not being madly
in love with her?

44:01.417 --> 44:04.952
I'm telling you, this girl
is certifiably insane.

44:04.954 --> 44:07.288
Has she been in your home

44:07.290 --> 44:10.324
or had access to your computer
within the last 48 hours?

44:10.326 --> 44:11.759
No.

44:11.761 --> 44:13.361
Does she have hacking skills?

44:13.363 --> 44:14.829
She got into my Twitter account

44:14.831 --> 44:17.832
and posted a bunch of
tweets that got me fired.

44:17.834 --> 44:19.700
All right, and you
have proof of this?

44:19.702 --> 44:20.702
I, no.

44:23.639 --> 44:26.741
Oh, well, either way,

44:26.743 --> 44:29.644
figuring out a Twitter password
and hacking into an IP address

44:29.646 --> 44:31.512
are two wildly
different skill sets.

44:31.514 --> 44:34.315
Besides, the files were found
on your local hard drive,

44:34.317 --> 44:36.017
which means the hacker
would have had to gain

44:36.019 --> 44:37.985
remote access to
your computer, so...

44:37.987 --> 44:39.887
Yeah, I don't
know how she did it,

44:39.889 --> 44:42.556
but I'm telling
you it wasn't me.

44:42.558 --> 44:44.558
Okay, write down
her name and address

44:44.560 --> 44:46.661
and I will look into it.

44:46.663 --> 44:48.596
But I'm gonna level
with you, Harris,

44:48.598 --> 44:50.464
what you're claiming is
gonna be very hard to prove

44:50.466 --> 44:52.433
without a confession.

44:52.435 --> 44:54.302
If this goes to trial
and you're convicted,

44:54.304 --> 44:56.037
you're looking at
serious jail time.

44:56.039 --> 44:58.339
If you plead guilty,
there's a very strong chance

44:58.341 --> 45:00.841
I can get you off
with just a fine.

45:00.843 --> 45:01.776
Which would be what?

45:01.778 --> 45:02.943
I don't know.

45:02.945 --> 45:05.346
Numbers could be
50, could be 100.

45:05.348 --> 45:06.747
Thousand?

45:06.749 --> 45:10.551
Better than five years
in a federal prison.

45:10.553 --> 45:11.652
Holy fuck.

45:11.654 --> 45:12.687
This cannot be happening.

45:12.689 --> 45:14.722
Well, it is.

45:14.724 --> 45:16.390
We go before a judge
by the end of the week.

45:16.392 --> 45:17.491
If we don't have anything real

45:17.493 --> 45:18.893
to back up your claims by then,

45:18.895 --> 45:21.062
I strongly suggest
pleading guilty.

45:21.064 --> 45:25.433
Now, is there anyone that
you can call to bail you out?

45:28.804 --> 45:29.804
Uh.

45:30.706 --> 45:31.939
I don't have my phone,

45:31.941 --> 45:34.041
I don't know anyone's numbers.

45:34.043 --> 45:36.911
I could send a Facebook message.

45:40.750 --> 45:44.652
♫ So lately been wondering

45:44.654 --> 45:48.823
♫ Who will be there
to take my place

45:48.825 --> 45:50.958
♫ When I'm gone

45:50.960 --> 45:53.027
Last call for alcohol!

45:53.029 --> 45:53.894
Harris!

45:53.896 --> 45:54.962
What, what?

45:54.964 --> 45:58.499
♫ Shadows on your face

46:00.502 --> 46:01.802
I think maybe you've had enough.

46:01.804 --> 46:02.837
Let me take you home.

46:02.839 --> 46:03.839
Home.

46:05.707 --> 46:09.510
My home is either
gonna be a jail cell

46:09.512 --> 46:13.981
or a fuckin' park bench,
because my life is ruined.

46:13.983 --> 46:18.152
And all for what, 'cause some
psychotic bitch felt spurned.

46:21.390 --> 46:23.591
There's gotta be
something you can do, right?

46:23.593 --> 46:25.960
♫ Way up high or down low

46:25.962 --> 46:27.495
According to my lawyer,

46:27.497 --> 46:29.397
barring a full
confession from Riley,

46:29.399 --> 46:33.033
I'm looking at,
best case scenario,

46:33.035 --> 46:35.669
a crippling fine and a spot

46:35.671 --> 46:38.739
on the registered
sex offenders list.

46:40.075 --> 46:43.010
So I will be a convicted felon,

46:43.012 --> 46:44.712
won't be able to get a job,

46:44.714 --> 46:47.982
won't be able to leave town,
can't vote.

46:47.984 --> 46:51.152
It's not like you
even voted before.

46:53.488 --> 46:55.189
I'm sorry, man, I know,
it's not funny.

46:55.191 --> 46:59.093
I'm just trying to
lighten the mood here.

46:59.095 --> 47:02.730
♫ Well I hope there's
someone out there

47:02.732 --> 47:04.999
♫ Who can bring me back to you

47:05.001 --> 47:07.201
Hey.
Who knows?

47:07.203 --> 47:10.471
Maybe Riley might have
a change of heart.

47:10.473 --> 47:11.572
She might admit to everything.

47:11.574 --> 47:12.706
Why?

47:12.708 --> 47:15.176
Why would she do that?
Huh?

47:15.178 --> 47:16.977
There's no way to
prove she did anything.

47:16.979 --> 47:19.513
She, she, she's fucking crazy.

47:19.515 --> 47:20.781
She hates me.

47:20.783 --> 47:23.017
There's no reason for her to.

47:25.854 --> 47:26.854
What?

47:29.591 --> 47:31.792
Think I just figured
a way outta this.

47:31.794 --> 47:32.693
Gotta go.

47:32.695 --> 47:33.761
No, no, no, no, Harris!

47:33.763 --> 47:34.962
I gotta fuckin' go, Chuck.

47:34.964 --> 47:37.164
♫ And bring me back to you

47:37.166 --> 47:38.599
♫ If I could

47:59.988 --> 48:00.988
Riley?

48:02.657 --> 48:04.892
Riley, it's Harris.

48:04.894 --> 48:07.795
What do you want?

48:07.797 --> 48:11.131
I just want to talk to you.

48:11.133 --> 48:12.666
It's 2:30
in the morning.

48:12.668 --> 48:14.034
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

48:14.036 --> 48:15.036
I just, uh.

48:17.272 --> 48:21.842
Doing a lot of soul searching
these last few days and, uh.

48:21.844 --> 48:24.979
I just really, I'd really
like to talk to you, you know?

48:24.981 --> 48:26.046
Face to face.

48:27.949 --> 48:29.950
I...

48:29.952 --> 48:33.120
Please, it'll just
take a few minutes.

48:44.199 --> 48:46.834
Thanks for letting me in, uh.

48:53.708 --> 48:56.310
Just, um, make it quick.

48:56.312 --> 48:59.013
I was about to go to sleep, so.

48:59.015 --> 49:00.848
Yeah.

49:00.850 --> 49:01.882
Uh.

49:04.786 --> 49:06.987
Just came by to say that, uh.

49:09.858 --> 49:11.825
Say that I'm sorry

49:11.827 --> 49:12.827
for

49:15.063 --> 49:16.063
everything.

49:17.732 --> 49:18.732
I, um.

49:21.069 --> 49:24.305
I wasn't a good person to you
and that's not who I am.

49:24.307 --> 49:28.309
Or, I mean, at least it's
not who I want to be and...

49:29.778 --> 49:35.082
So, I'm sorry that I hurt you

49:35.084 --> 49:38.285
and I'm sorry that I used you

49:38.287 --> 49:40.054
and I'm sorry that.

49:43.224 --> 49:45.726
Sorry I made you feel
like you didn't matter.

49:48.129 --> 49:52.299
I wish I could say I had
some kind of excuse, but...

49:55.671 --> 49:57.304
I'm just a selfish asshole

49:57.306 --> 50:01.675
who didn't care about
anybody's feelings but his own.

50:09.050 --> 50:10.918
Why are you telling me this?

50:10.920 --> 50:14.755
'Cause I don't wanna
be that person anymore.

50:16.725 --> 50:19.293
And it took what
happened between us

50:19.295 --> 50:22.196
for me to realize that and...

50:22.198 --> 50:26.166
So, I just wanted
to say I'm sorry

50:26.168 --> 50:29.003
and, I guess thank you

50:32.941 --> 50:35.843
for showing me how
fucked up I was.

50:42.417 --> 50:43.651
Well.

50:45.787 --> 50:47.788
You're welcome, I guess.

50:49.357 --> 50:52.126
You wanna hug it out?

50:53.429 --> 50:55.329
You know me, I'm a hugger.

50:56.331 --> 50:57.931
Sure.

51:10.345 --> 51:14.448
Well, I'll let
you get some sleep.

51:14.450 --> 51:17.985
Thanks for letting me talk.

51:22.891 --> 51:23.891
Wait.

51:27.062 --> 51:29.063
I want to apologize too.

51:31.266 --> 51:32.266
For what?

51:39.174 --> 51:43.310
You really hurt me, Harris,

51:43.312 --> 51:45.212
and it sucked, but, um...

51:48.249 --> 51:51.485
I lashed out and it
wasn't fair to you.

51:53.354 --> 51:55.189
- It's okay.
- No.

51:56.391 --> 51:58.092
No, it's not okay.

51:59.494 --> 52:03.931
That fake suicide stunt
I pulled was not cool

52:03.933 --> 52:07.000
and I, I kind of do
that stuff a lot.

52:09.037 --> 52:10.204
Anyway, I'm sorry.

52:14.342 --> 52:15.943
It's all right.

52:15.945 --> 52:18.145
I guess we kind of both
lost our heads there.

52:18.147 --> 52:20.447
Yeah.

52:24.886 --> 52:26.987
Is there anything else?

52:28.957 --> 52:29.957
Like what?

52:31.192 --> 52:32.993
I don't know, um...

52:34.496 --> 52:37.765
anything else you want
to come clean about?

52:37.767 --> 52:40.868
Like, that you did to me.

52:42.937 --> 52:45.806
I don't, I don't, uh,

52:45.808 --> 52:49.042
know what you're
talking about, Harris.

52:51.913 --> 52:53.280
So you don't know anything about

52:53.282 --> 52:56.950
any child pornography
on my laptop?

52:56.952 --> 52:58.252
The what?

52:58.254 --> 53:00.788
I know it was you, Riley.

53:03.993 --> 53:04.993
Okay.

53:05.894 --> 53:07.427
I, you need to leave.

53:11.299 --> 53:13.333
I'll leave if you
admit what you did.

53:13.335 --> 53:15.869
- Let go of me.
- Just admit it.

53:15.871 --> 53:16.904
Just admit it.

53:16.906 --> 53:19.907
Just admit what you did.

53:19.909 --> 53:21.141
Let go of me or I'll scream.

53:21.143 --> 53:22.342
You're not gonna scream.

53:22.344 --> 53:23.377
Just calm down.

53:25.247 --> 53:26.380
Stop!

53:26.382 --> 53:28.248
Just shut up!

53:28.250 --> 53:29.283
Why are you doing this?

53:29.285 --> 53:31.285
Why do you want to ruin my life?

53:35.057 --> 53:36.323
Are you okay?

53:36.325 --> 53:39.827
- Call the police!
- No, don't!

53:39.829 --> 53:41.295
Tell the cops what
you did, Riley,

53:41.297 --> 53:44.364
or I'm coming back here,
I swear to God.

53:49.938 --> 53:51.338
Harris, it's Ronald Dale.

53:51.340 --> 53:53.907
What the hell did
you do last night?

53:53.909 --> 53:55.375
Nothing, I was home all night.

53:55.377 --> 53:57.110
You're lying.

53:57.112 --> 53:59.446
You were at that woman's
place last night, Miller?

53:59.448 --> 54:01.014
How the hell do you know that?

54:01.016 --> 54:02.216
Because she wants to file

54:02.218 --> 54:03.951
a restraining order against you.

54:03.953 --> 54:06.053
She claims you attacked
her last night.

54:06.055 --> 54:07.955
What were you thinking, Harris?

54:07.957 --> 54:10.324
Do you understand how
bad this looks for us?

54:10.326 --> 54:12.426
It practically negates
your entire defense,

54:12.428 --> 54:14.361
which is thin to begin with.

54:14.363 --> 54:18.498
I didn't attack her, I was
trying to get her to confess.

54:18.500 --> 54:20.100
This is another of
her manipulations.

54:20.102 --> 54:22.202
She's trying to play us.

54:22.204 --> 54:24.338
I checked her out, Harris.

54:24.340 --> 54:27.441
She's got alibis during the
time the files were downloaded.

54:27.443 --> 54:30.277
Pictures on Instagram,
updates on Facebook,

54:30.279 --> 54:32.512
I mean, the girl puts
her whole life online,

54:32.514 --> 54:35.015
but unfortunately for you
that works against us.

54:35.017 --> 54:36.383
She hired someone then.

54:36.385 --> 54:38.252
It's possible, but don't try

54:38.254 --> 54:39.920
and do any more
detective work yourself.

54:39.922 --> 54:41.355
You have two days.

54:41.357 --> 54:43.624
Lay low and think
about what I told you.

54:43.626 --> 54:45.392
I can keep you out of prison,

54:45.394 --> 54:47.461
but not if you keep
mucking it up for yourself.

54:47.463 --> 54:48.463
Okay?

55:18.459 --> 55:21.561
What should be your name?

55:24.532 --> 55:25.699
Robby Barnett.

56:10.278 --> 56:12.679
Oh, Riley, Riley, Riley.

56:12.681 --> 56:15.549
You really should keep
your profile private, babe,

56:15.551 --> 56:17.451
there's creeps out there.

56:19.587 --> 56:22.089
"Aced my Behavioral Psych final!

56:22.091 --> 56:23.557
"Time to celebrate!"

56:24.559 --> 56:25.592
Okay.

56:56.024 --> 56:58.091
All right, let's do this.

57:13.374 --> 57:16.209
Come on, Riley, where are you?

57:16.211 --> 57:17.377
Where are you?

57:23.117 --> 57:24.284
There you are.

57:46.674 --> 57:47.674
That's it.

57:49.510 --> 57:51.845
Do some swiping.

57:51.847 --> 57:56.349
I know you want to find
some other guy to terrorize.

58:02.657 --> 58:05.459
Hey, do I know you?

58:05.461 --> 58:08.762
I think we have
Behavioral Psych together.

58:22.176 --> 58:23.710
Come on, Riley, respond.

58:23.712 --> 58:25.345
Come on, come on.

58:27.381 --> 58:28.615
Come on, come on.

58:30.118 --> 58:31.618
There we go.

58:31.620 --> 58:33.787
I usually sit in the back.

58:35.389 --> 58:37.557
How'd you do on the final?

58:42.597 --> 58:43.697
Aced it.

58:43.699 --> 58:44.664
You?

58:44.666 --> 58:46.266
Same.

58:46.268 --> 58:47.767
What you doing tonight?

58:47.769 --> 58:49.636
We should celebrate.

58:52.441 --> 58:55.308
"I'll be at the Virgil,
you should drop by."

58:55.310 --> 58:56.310
Mm, yes.

58:56.911 --> 58:58.278
I'll be there.

59:00.715 --> 59:01.715
Shit.

59:32.880 --> 59:34.481
♫ No time to come

59:34.483 --> 59:36.216
♫ Your race is run

59:36.218 --> 59:39.219
♫ No time to shine

59:40.655 --> 59:41.821
♫ All cloaked in gloom

59:41.823 --> 59:43.890
♫ You broke too soon

59:43.892 --> 59:47.761
♫ And left behind too late

59:50.766 --> 59:54.367
♫ Why do you wait

59:54.369 --> 59:58.538
♫ To see the golden gate

59:58.540 --> 01:00:02.309
♫ The many hearts we found

01:00:02.311 --> 01:00:05.312
♫ Would not be hard

01:00:21.629 --> 01:00:24.698
♫ My girl says so

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:27.400
♫ Got a style

01:01:04.038 --> 01:01:07.340
Hey, can I get a
vodka cranberry please?

01:01:07.342 --> 01:01:08.875
Hey, can I get
a vodka cranberry?

01:01:08.877 --> 01:01:09.877
Of course.

01:01:25.559 --> 01:01:27.494
That'll be ten dollars.

01:01:29.297 --> 01:01:31.031
Great, thank you.

01:03:12.767 --> 01:03:13.933
That guy Robby's here.

01:03:13.935 --> 01:03:15.769
I'm gonna go meet him.

01:04:07.889 --> 01:04:09.055
Riley.

01:04:09.057 --> 01:04:10.156
Riley, relax.

01:04:10.158 --> 01:04:11.758
Riley, calm down.

01:04:12.993 --> 01:04:14.994
Riley, for God's sake.

01:04:14.996 --> 01:04:17.230
I told you to fuckin' stop.

01:04:18.666 --> 01:04:19.799
Jesus.

01:04:19.801 --> 01:04:21.100
You see what you've done to me?

01:04:21.102 --> 01:04:22.735
You see what you've
turned me into?

01:04:22.737 --> 01:04:26.005
I have never hurt anybody
in my entire life

01:04:26.007 --> 01:04:28.007
and I don't want to
tonight, Riley, I don't,

01:04:28.009 --> 01:04:29.709
do you understand?

01:04:31.111 --> 01:04:33.012
Good.

01:04:33.014 --> 01:04:36.149
If you do exactly
what I tell you to do,

01:04:38.853 --> 01:04:41.554
this all ends tonight.

01:04:41.556 --> 01:04:44.624
Is that what you want?

01:04:44.626 --> 01:04:46.759
Good, me too, me too,
that's what I want.

01:04:46.761 --> 01:04:50.997
So I'm gonna take that
gag off so you can talk,

01:04:50.999 --> 01:04:54.033
but you're not
gonna scream, okay?

01:04:57.071 --> 01:04:58.071
Okay.

01:05:00.007 --> 01:05:01.241
Put this away.

01:05:03.143 --> 01:05:04.844
Taking it off now.

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:20.960
See?

01:05:20.962 --> 01:05:23.296
Cooperating.

01:05:23.298 --> 01:05:27.200
This doesn't have to
be difficult, Riley.

01:05:27.202 --> 01:05:29.002
Where am I?

01:05:29.004 --> 01:05:31.104
You don't need to know.

01:05:31.106 --> 01:05:34.607
All you need to know is that
it's just you and me here

01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:37.043
all weekend if
that's what it takes.

01:05:37.045 --> 01:05:40.747
Oh, and don't bother
trying to escape 'cause

01:05:41.982 --> 01:05:45.218
we're locked up nice and tight.

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:46.819
That guy Robby,

01:05:47.955 --> 01:05:50.156
that was you the whole time?

01:05:50.158 --> 01:05:52.258
A little taste of
your own medicine, huh?

01:05:54.062 --> 01:05:56.563
That's my friends.

01:05:56.565 --> 01:05:59.132
I bet they're looking for me.

01:05:59.134 --> 01:06:01.134
They've been texting
you for a few hours now,

01:06:01.136 --> 01:06:05.004
that's why, um, that's
why I need your passcode.

01:06:05.006 --> 01:06:06.205
What?

01:06:06.207 --> 01:06:07.340
I need to unlock your phone.

01:06:07.342 --> 01:06:09.342
Can I get your passcode?

01:06:10.311 --> 01:06:12.045
And just remember, Riley,

01:06:12.047 --> 01:06:17.216
whatever happens next
is entirely up to you.

01:06:19.954 --> 01:06:22.789
0-9-0-2.

01:06:25.125 --> 01:06:26.125
Ah, voila.

01:06:28.195 --> 01:06:29.996
Thank you, Riley.

01:06:29.998 --> 01:06:32.699
See, if the rest of the
night goes just like this,

01:06:32.701 --> 01:06:35.301
we'll be done in no time.

01:06:35.303 --> 01:06:36.336
Okay.

01:06:36.338 --> 01:06:37.338
How's it look?

01:06:40.642 --> 01:06:41.975
Left with Robby.

01:06:44.111 --> 01:06:46.045
No need to wait up.

01:06:46.047 --> 01:06:47.981
Ooh, Brunch tomorrow?

01:06:50.951 --> 01:06:51.951
Sent.

01:06:53.354 --> 01:06:54.988
See what happens.

01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:57.056
Oh, look, she's typing.

01:06:57.058 --> 01:06:58.324
"Slut."

01:06:58.326 --> 01:07:00.093
"Call me tomorrow."

01:07:01.095 --> 01:07:02.362
That takes care of that.

01:07:02.364 --> 01:07:05.064
And you will call her tomorrow,

01:07:05.066 --> 01:07:06.099
as long as you don't
give me any trouble

01:07:06.101 --> 01:07:07.767
with this next part.

01:07:08.669 --> 01:07:10.169
What do you want?

01:07:10.171 --> 01:07:13.740
I want a full confession.

01:07:13.742 --> 01:07:15.642
I don't know what you
want me to confess to.

01:07:15.644 --> 01:07:18.645
Goddammit, Riley, I thought
we weren't gonna do this.

01:07:18.647 --> 01:07:21.714
I'm cooperating, I just
don't know what you want.

01:07:21.716 --> 01:07:23.082
Just stop!

01:07:23.084 --> 01:07:24.851
For fuck's sake,
enough of your games.

01:07:24.853 --> 01:07:27.420
Just tell the fucking truth
for once in your life.

01:07:27.422 --> 01:07:28.721
Okay, okay.

01:07:30.157 --> 01:07:33.826
I'll confess, to everything.

01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:36.262
Yes, finally.

01:07:37.297 --> 01:07:39.165
Thank you.

01:07:39.167 --> 01:07:41.834
All right, just
don't hurt me, please.

01:07:41.836 --> 01:07:44.270
I won't, okay, here we go.

01:07:44.272 --> 01:07:47.840
All right, I want you to
look straight in the camera

01:07:47.842 --> 01:07:51.010
and when I tell you to,
start talking.

01:07:52.246 --> 01:07:53.446
Well, wait, aren't you gonna

01:07:53.448 --> 01:07:55.415
take me to the police station?

01:07:55.417 --> 01:07:57.817
Oh, yeah, so you can just
start lying to the cops

01:07:57.819 --> 01:07:59.259
the second you walk
through the door?

01:08:00.055 --> 01:08:02.955
No, Riley, it has
to be like this.

01:08:04.124 --> 01:08:05.958
What do you want me to say?

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:07.760
Don't be difficult, Riley.

01:08:07.762 --> 01:08:12.231
I'm not, I just,
I'm, I'm nervous

01:08:12.233 --> 01:08:15.868
and I don't want to
miss anything, okay?

01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:16.870
Fine.

01:08:18.037 --> 01:08:21.006
Tell them about
how we first met.

01:08:21.009 --> 01:08:24.243
Tell them how you
hounded me incessantly,

01:08:24.245 --> 01:08:25.812
how you stalked me,

01:08:25.814 --> 01:08:27.412
and then when you discovered

01:08:27.415 --> 01:08:29.182
that we weren't gonna
be together forever,

01:08:29.184 --> 01:08:31.050
how you took your revenge.

01:08:31.051 --> 01:08:33.786
You hacked into my Twitter
account, you got me fired,

01:08:33.787 --> 01:08:37.457
and then, and this is
the most important part,

01:08:37.459 --> 01:08:40.859
tell them how you somehow
remotely downloaded

01:08:40.862 --> 01:08:44.330
five gigs of child
pornography onto my computer,

01:08:44.332 --> 01:08:48.067
which could get me sent to
prison for half a decade.

01:08:48.069 --> 01:08:49.069
Harris, I.

01:08:53.006 --> 01:08:56.975
Okay, I'll.

01:08:56.978 --> 01:08:59.212
I'll say all of that.

01:08:59.214 --> 01:09:00.214
Thank you.

01:09:01.247 --> 01:09:02.415
Are you ready?

01:09:03.417 --> 01:09:04.751
Yeah.

01:09:04.752 --> 01:09:05.752
Great.

01:09:08.455 --> 01:09:09.455
Go ahead.

01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:15.127
- Wait.
- What? What, Riley?

01:09:15.130 --> 01:09:16.828
For fuck's sake, I know this
is gonna be hard on you,

01:09:16.831 --> 01:09:18.397
just, you don't
really have a choice.

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:22.001
I want to confess to everything.

01:09:24.139 --> 01:09:26.805
It's just, this won't work.

01:09:26.808 --> 01:09:28.774
Why?
Why the fuck not?

01:09:28.777 --> 01:09:30.343
Because look at me, Harris,

01:09:30.345 --> 01:09:34.313
I'm a crying mess and
I'm tied to a chair.

01:09:34.314 --> 01:09:38.216
It looks like I'm,
like I'm kidnapped.

01:09:38.219 --> 01:09:40.252
Can't do anything about that.

01:09:40.255 --> 01:09:42.255
- You could untie me.
- I don't think so.

01:09:42.256 --> 01:09:44.524
Wait, just listen.

01:09:44.526 --> 01:09:48.327
You could untie me and I
could wash up in the bathroom

01:09:48.328 --> 01:09:49.996
and then I could film the video,

01:09:49.997 --> 01:09:51.831
I could, I could make,
like, an Instagram video

01:09:51.832 --> 01:09:54.934
where I'm bragging about
how I screwed up your life

01:09:54.936 --> 01:09:57.303
and then, and then you
could show that to the cops

01:09:57.305 --> 01:10:00.039
and I'll, I'll confess to
everything at the police station

01:10:00.041 --> 01:10:03.209
and it'll seem totally
real, you know?

01:10:05.179 --> 01:10:06.546
Why?

01:10:06.548 --> 01:10:08.948
Why would you do that?

01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:12.318
Because,

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.320
you got me.

01:10:15.055 --> 01:10:17.223
You won.

01:10:17.225 --> 01:10:20.193
I give up.

01:10:20.195 --> 01:10:22.128
You're just clever.

01:10:24.231 --> 01:10:28.267
This is exactly the kind of
clever shit you pulled on me.

01:10:28.269 --> 01:10:30.203
It's a gift, I guess.

01:10:37.511 --> 01:10:39.145
Fine.

01:10:39.147 --> 01:10:42.081
There's a bathroom
attached to the stage.

01:10:42.083 --> 01:10:44.116
It'll work, I swear.

01:10:44.118 --> 01:10:47.053
Riley, don't try
a fucking thing.

01:10:52.326 --> 01:10:54.894
I want you to tell me
what you're gonna say.

01:10:54.896 --> 01:10:56.295
Anything you want.

01:11:07.407 --> 01:11:10.943
Can you get me some
paper towels please?

01:11:23.190 --> 01:11:25.458
Should talk about how,

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:27.293
should talk about how stupid
I am, how you tricked me,

01:11:27.295 --> 01:11:29.495
but don't use my name,
it can't feel staged.

01:11:29.497 --> 01:11:31.497
Okay, got it.

01:11:37.104 --> 01:11:38.404
I think I'm ready.

01:11:40.908 --> 01:11:42.341
Shit.

01:11:42.343 --> 01:11:43.376
My hands are so wet.

01:11:43.378 --> 01:11:45.912
Can I have another paper towel?

01:11:45.914 --> 01:11:47.146
Oh.

01:12:00.361 --> 01:12:03.963
Goddammit!

01:12:03.965 --> 01:12:06.198
Fuckin' bitch!

01:12:11.038 --> 01:12:13.406
Goddammit.

01:12:14.441 --> 01:12:15.474
Riley!

01:12:22.349 --> 01:12:24.650
Riley, where the fuck are you?

01:12:26.053 --> 01:12:27.053
God.

01:12:33.527 --> 01:12:34.527
Riley!

01:12:39.032 --> 01:12:40.466
Riley!

01:13:11.298 --> 01:13:12.565
You think you can get
away from me that easy,

01:13:12.567 --> 01:13:14.100
you crazy bitch?

01:13:14.102 --> 01:13:15.102
Huh?

01:13:24.144 --> 01:13:25.144
Goddammit.

01:14:02.382 --> 01:14:04.083
You call me crazy.

01:14:33.747 --> 01:14:34.747
Hello?

01:14:37.517 --> 01:14:38.517
Help!

01:14:41.589 --> 01:14:42.589
Help me!

01:14:55.635 --> 01:14:56.635
Help!

01:15:01.842 --> 01:15:02.842
Hello!

01:15:04.344 --> 01:15:05.444
Help, please!

01:15:06.646 --> 01:15:07.646
Please!

01:15:19.159 --> 01:15:20.392
You stabbed me.

01:16:43.643 --> 01:16:44.677
Riley.

01:16:47.547 --> 01:16:49.682
Why didn't you just confess?

01:17:05.832 --> 01:17:06.932
Hello?

01:17:06.934 --> 01:17:08.567
Jesus Christ, Harris.

01:17:08.569 --> 01:17:10.302
I've been trying to
reach you all night.

01:17:10.304 --> 01:17:12.371
It's Ronald Dale, your lawyer.

01:17:12.373 --> 01:17:13.739
Where the hell have you been?

01:17:13.741 --> 01:17:14.773
Huh?

01:17:14.775 --> 01:17:16.542
Uh-oh, are you drunk?

01:17:16.544 --> 01:17:18.310
Harris, listen to
me very carefully.

01:17:18.312 --> 01:17:19.478
You're off the hook.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:20.779
What?

01:17:20.781 --> 01:17:22.648
Yeah, you were right, sort of.

01:17:22.650 --> 01:17:25.651
Turns out you were hacked,
but not by that girl.

01:17:25.653 --> 01:17:27.853
By some 15-year-old
kid named Keenan.

01:17:27.855 --> 01:17:29.688
Gil Keenan from
Colorado Springs.

01:17:29.690 --> 01:17:31.657
- Heard of him?
- Keenan?

01:17:31.659 --> 01:17:32.858
Yeah, you probably know him

01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:35.394
from his online name, ShadowMan.

01:17:35.396 --> 01:17:37.296
Apparently you mocked
him on some video game.

01:17:37.298 --> 01:17:38.897
Can you believe that?

01:17:38.899 --> 01:17:41.667
His mom caught him, made
him 'fess up to everything.

01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:42.968
I got the call yesterday
and I've been trying

01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:44.737
to call you ever since.

01:17:44.739 --> 01:17:47.673
You're off the hook,
Harris, you're a free man.

01:17:47.675 --> 01:17:48.774
Go celebrate!

01:17:50.043 --> 01:17:51.710
Hello?

01:17:51.712 --> 01:17:52.945
Harris?

01:17:52.947 --> 01:17:54.546
Are you there?

01:17:54.548 --> 01:17:55.548
Hello?

01:18:06.493 --> 01:18:07.493
Hey, you.

01:18:09.396 --> 01:18:11.730
What are you doing out here?

01:18:12.899 --> 01:18:15.668
Jesus, what the hell happened?

01:18:15.670 --> 01:18:17.303
Holy fuckin' Christ.

01:18:17.305 --> 01:18:21.006
Get your hands where
I can see 'em, now!

01:18:21.008 --> 01:18:23.742
I need backup at 3421
Empire Boulevard.

01:18:23.744 --> 01:18:24.710
Got a maniac here.

01:18:24.712 --> 01:18:26.545
He killed some poor girl.

01:18:45.065 --> 01:18:48.901
♫ I was drifting

01:18:48.903 --> 01:18:52.338
♫ Into dreaming

01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:55.941
♫ And I saw something

01:18:55.943 --> 01:19:00.346
♫ I hadn't seen before

01:19:00.348 --> 01:19:03.782
♫ Two young ladies

01:19:03.784 --> 01:19:07.920
♫ I hadn't seen
since high school

01:19:07.922 --> 01:19:11.423
♫ Holding a piece of me

01:19:11.425 --> 01:19:14.993
♫ Inside a plastic jar

01:19:14.995 --> 01:19:20.065
♫ And there was a
hook attached to it

01:19:22.902 --> 01:19:26.872
♫ And they were
attached at the hip

01:19:46.559 --> 01:19:50.028
♫ I was driving on vacation

01:19:53.466 --> 01:19:57.002
♫ And I saw something

01:19:57.004 --> 01:20:00.839
♫ I hadn't seen in years

01:20:00.841 --> 01:20:04.910
♫ The man was seizing

01:20:04.912 --> 01:20:08.480
♫ On the pavement flailing

01:20:08.482 --> 01:20:12.418
♫ And I did nothing

01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:16.455
♫ A white-dressed
woman carried him off

01:20:16.457 --> 01:20:19.858
♫ I didn't lift a finger

01:20:23.797 --> 01:20:27.032
♫ I didn't stop my car

01:20:31.671 --> 01:20:34.873
♫ I just kept on driving

01:20:39.078 --> 01:20:43.081
♫ I didn't help that man at all

01:20:45.452 --> 01:20:48.921
♫ And I hope he forgives me.
