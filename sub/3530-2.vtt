00:00.960 --> 00:03.120
I've been deceived
about Anne of Cleves.

00:03.120 --> 00:04.600
If I had known what I know now,

00:04.600 --> 00:06.240
she would never have
been brought here.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.960
It is my duty to inform
you that Parliament

00:08.960 --> 00:12.160
have found your marriage
to the King to be invalid.

00:12.160 --> 00:13.760
Gentlemen and Ladies of the Court,

00:13.760 --> 00:16.720
I come here this day to
present to you my new wife:

00:16.720 --> 00:17.760
Queen Katherine.

00:17.760 --> 00:19.160
Queen Katherine!

00:19.400 --> 00:21.240
I feel almost like
a new man, Charles.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.840
Should the man that woman gives
herself to always be happy?

00:23.840 --> 00:26.040
Sex, Charles, is a great medicine.

00:26.160 --> 00:29.440
I do not know who to say this to,
Mr. Culpepper.

00:29.440 --> 00:33.320
I am not so used to
everyone looking at me.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.560
My Lady, you must give
men leave to look...

00:36.080 --> 00:37.040
There is no help for it.

00:38.240 --> 00:41.000
Tell me, my Lord Surrey,
how do you find the English Court?

00:41.000 --> 00:43.560
I find it full of
men of vile birth.

00:43.560 --> 00:44.880
His family have royal blood.

00:44.880 --> 00:47.800
Surely even you can see the
merits of dealing with him!

00:48.600 --> 00:51.000
I invited you here because
I wanted to be friends.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.080
What kind of friends?

00:54.080 --> 00:55.080
Lady Mary,

00:55.080 --> 00:59.000
it is my dearest wish that you
and I may be warm to each other.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.840
After all, you are
now my stepdaughter.

01:02.880 --> 01:06.200
Your old friend is here:
Miss Joan Bulmer.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.680
Do you remember when
you-know-who used to come in?

01:08.680 --> 01:10.800
Late at night? And slip into bed?

01:12.040 --> 01:14.880
For God's sake,
be careful what you say!

01:14.880 --> 01:16.000
She's a little fireball.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.040
Too hot for you, Mr. Culpepper.

01:18.240 --> 01:20.640
Really? Just picture
her naked body,

01:20.960 --> 01:22.960
those breasts, those thighs

01:22.960 --> 01:24.720
that sweet little arse.

01:24.720 --> 01:27.600
All those things
belong to the King.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074

03:27.640 --> 03:30.520
How happy her Majesty must be,
Lady Rochford.

03:30.520 --> 03:33.120
It seems to me she does
nothing but dance and rejoice!

03:33.920 --> 03:36.520
She has every reason to be happy,
Mr. Culpepper.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.200
The King spoils her.

03:38.200 --> 03:41.040
Almost every day he buys
her new dresses or jewels.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.760
It seems he cannot
treat her well enough!

03:44.960 --> 03:46.680
I presume the King
is also very happy?

03:47.520 --> 03:49.360
His Majesty seems like a new man.

03:49.760 --> 03:53.520
He rises between 5 and 6 am,
attends Mass at 7,

03:53.880 --> 03:56.400
rides out early to hunt,
comes back at 10 for dinner,

03:56.400 --> 03:58.000
and attends to business
in the afternoon.

03:58.600 --> 04:01.400
I think his new rule of living
is intended to keep him fit

04:01.840 --> 04:02.880
if you understand me.

04:04.480 --> 04:07.760
I suppose he would needs be fit,
if he wants to satisfy her.

04:09.720 --> 04:12.800
She is very... appealing.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.480
She's just a fool, Mr. Culpepper.

04:19.399 --> 04:22.360
A sweet little fool!

04:27.160 --> 04:28.960
How about you, Lady Rochford?

04:29.320 --> 04:31.760
It's been some time since
George Boleyn's death;

04:32.040 --> 04:34.400
- You've not remarried?
- No.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.200
The Duke of Suffolk, your Majesty.

04:56.400 --> 05:00.240
Charles, I have something
I want to show you.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.400
I've had a medal struck to
commemorate my marriage.

05:06.520 --> 05:11.440
"Henricus VIII:
Rutilands rosa sine spina."

05:12.400 --> 05:13.720
"My rose without a thorn."

05:14.720 --> 05:17.280
Tell me: how is Anne of Cleves?

05:18.800 --> 05:20.960
I believe she has settled
into her new estates,

05:20.960 --> 05:23.040
and shows every sign
of being grateful

05:23.480 --> 05:25.200
for your Majesty's
charity and generosity.

05:26.160 --> 05:30.040
I also understand that she has
maintained her relationships

05:30.040 --> 05:31.560
with your Majesty's daughters

05:33.320 --> 05:35.080
and often asks them
to dine with her.

05:38.080 --> 05:38.920
Risley.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.240
Majesty. We shall
write to the Lady Anne

05:41.240 --> 05:43.000
to thank her for
being so conformable,

05:43.560 --> 05:45.480
and to assure her that if
she continues in this way,

05:45.480 --> 05:47.200
she will find in us
a perfect friend,

05:48.040 --> 05:50.520
content to repute her
as our dearest sister.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.200
Majesty.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.080
Does the Duchess love
you any better, Charles?

05:59.440 --> 06:00.440
She seems to...

06:01.800 --> 06:03.360
but only for the
sake of appearances.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.840
How can I help you Charles?

06:14.320 --> 06:17.240
Well, when she consents to
make love to me again...

06:18.200 --> 06:19.960
strike a medal to commemorate it!

06:35.520 --> 06:38.240
- My Lady.
- My Lord Surrey.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.840
I had rather trusted
to hear from you.

06:41.560 --> 06:42.440
Why?

06:43.080 --> 06:47.040
When we supped together,
you gave me to suppose that...

06:47.680 --> 06:49.080
Mr. Culpepper.

06:49.600 --> 06:50.720
Your Majesty.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.480
That I what, my Lord?

06:59.960 --> 07:01.600
That you would oblige me

07:03.000 --> 07:05.240
and accommodate my desire.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.040
If I gave you that
impression I am truly sorry.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.920
It was far from my intention.

07:20.560 --> 07:21.880
Sleep with me.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.920
Don't you know who I am?

07:31.400 --> 07:33.120
Of course I know who you are.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.040
And you know who my husband is!

07:36.800 --> 07:39.920
Yes I do! He's a Seymour.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.080
His family are wolves.

07:45.240 --> 07:47.840
Mine are lions!

07:50.200 --> 07:53.760
Forgive me for aiming so low!

08:00.520 --> 08:02.440
My Lord, his Majesty
wants to see you.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.240
The Earl of Hertford,
your majesty.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.680
I wish I could go
dancing like all of you!

08:19.280 --> 08:20.800
Whenever I hear the music,

08:20.800 --> 08:24.080
I feel like nobody has
a care in the world!

08:26.640 --> 08:28.000
Look at my cares!

08:29.360 --> 08:32.559
I had someone once who could
take care of all of this!

08:33.280 --> 08:34.320
But now he's gone!

08:35.280 --> 08:36.440
How is my son?

08:37.159 --> 08:40.080
Prince Edward is very well.
He is a strong and healthy boy.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.480
He does his father proud.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.480
Thank God.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.960
I trust he will soon be
followed by other princes.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.680
I'm making you a new appointment.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.920
I'm making you Lieutenant
General to the North.

08:58.240 --> 08:59.840
Recently, there's been
too many incursions

08:59.840 --> 09:02.120
over the border from
Scotland into England.

09:02.480 --> 09:05.240
I want you to deal with my cousin,
the King of the Scots,

09:05.240 --> 09:07.120
and I want these
incursions stopped.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.760
If he does not stop them,

09:09.400 --> 09:10.960
you have our express permission

09:10.960 --> 09:14.120
to harry and persecute the
people on his side of the border

09:14.120 --> 09:17.600
with as much aggression and
as much force as you see fit.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.640
I understand.

09:22.160 --> 09:25.760
We might, in time,
meet our cousin, King James.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.760
For all we know, he may not
be as stupid as he appears.

09:28.760 --> 09:29.760
But for now,

09:30.120 --> 09:33.920
I am trusting you to ensure
that the Scots cease their...

09:37.840 --> 09:39.160
impertinence.

09:42.880 --> 09:43.800
Katherine!

09:44.720 --> 09:48.080
Oh God, oh fuck me!

09:48.080 --> 09:49.160
Katherine!

09:49.160 --> 09:53.240
Oh, fuck me... oh yes... oh yes...

09:53.240 --> 09:56.440
- Oh, Katherine!
- Oh yes... oh yes...

09:56.440 --> 09:58.040
Oh God...

09:58.400 --> 10:00.160
Oh just fuck me...

10:15.640 --> 10:17.240
Go on! Tell me more!

10:18.480 --> 10:20.040
I promised her I wouldn't.

10:21.440 --> 10:24.720
Dearest Joan, you can tell me.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.040
I'm responsible for everything
to do with the Queen.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.240
So, I have to know everything.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.120
That way, I can protect her.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.240
So... when you both lived at Lambeth,

10:36.240 --> 10:38.040
under the protection
of the Duchess,

10:38.560 --> 10:40.400
what exactly happened?

10:42.760 --> 10:44.520
There were these two Gallants.

10:45.480 --> 10:48.040
They were called Frances Dereham

10:48.720 --> 10:50.760
and Edward Waldegrave,

10:51.120 --> 10:53.920
who was a Gentleman in
Waiting upon the Duchess.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.160
Anyway,

10:56.800 --> 11:00.280
they found a way to call,
secretly, at night,

11:00.720 --> 11:02.040
upon Katherine and me.

11:02.560 --> 11:06.200
And they would lie in
our beds all night.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.720
You with Waldegrave

11:09.720 --> 11:11.920
and Katherine with
this Francis Dereham?

11:12.440 --> 11:14.200
Yes. That's how it was.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.360
And what would these
gentlemen do to you?

11:25.200 --> 11:28.760
Didn't anyone say anything?
Didn't they find out?

11:29.960 --> 11:34.200
Well, if Dereham used her
as a man doth his wife,

11:34.720 --> 11:37.880
it was only because she thought
herself already betrothed to him.

11:38.560 --> 11:39.840
Like on a promise.

11:40.320 --> 11:43.080
It went on between
them a long time.

11:52.840 --> 11:54.840
Still, you won't tell anyone,
will you?

11:56.200 --> 11:57.640
You won't say anything?

11:58.640 --> 12:00.200
She made me swear!

12:03.000 --> 12:05.920
No. I won't say anything.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.120
Good morning!
It's a lovely day today!

12:11.120 --> 12:12.680
[Peddler]: Come on!
Get out of my way!

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
What are you looking at?

12:15.000 --> 12:15.840
[Man] Take a bushel!

12:22.200 --> 12:24.240
Hey, clear out of here,
you fucking slut!

12:25.200 --> 12:26.880
Hey! What in God's
name are you doing?!

12:28.400 --> 12:30.400
Starin' at a real woman, are you?

12:32.760 --> 12:33.840
What are you looking at? Eh?

12:38.800 --> 12:41.520
Good sport my Lord, good sport!

12:42.560 --> 12:43.840
Ain't right!

12:48.720 --> 12:52.520
The Earl of Surrey has been jailed
for public disorder, your majesty.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.320
The Earl maintained he
was the scourge of God?

12:56.320 --> 12:57.400
Yes, your Majesty.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.800
And called London itself
"a shameless whore"?

13:01.800 --> 13:03.360
Yes. He did indeed so.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.080
What about eating
meat during Lent?

13:11.080 --> 13:14.200
He told us he had a
license to do so. But...

13:16.320 --> 13:17.240
But what?

13:17.960 --> 13:20.560
Um, Bishop Gardiner suspects

13:20.560 --> 13:23.120
my Lord Surrey of obtaining
his meat on the black market,

13:23.120 --> 13:25.600
from some evangelical
butchers in Honey Lane,

13:25.640 --> 13:26.760
near the church of All Hallows.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.720
This same church, your Majesty,

13:29.720 --> 13:31.800
is suspected by some
of secretly sowing

13:31.800 --> 13:34.440
and setting forth
Lutheran heresies,

13:34.680 --> 13:37.120
and of deliberately flouting the
fasting laws. Pound it back!

13:39.000 --> 13:41.160
I never thought Surrey
could be a heretic.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.960
His father is closer
to a Papist...

13:44.480 --> 13:46.600
although to my face,
he pretends otherwise!

13:47.040 --> 13:49.080
His Grace and I would be inclined,

13:49.080 --> 13:50.440
with your Majesty's permission,

13:50.440 --> 13:53.520
to examine the Earl more closely

13:53.520 --> 13:55.480
on these fundamental matters.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.160
You want to torture him?

14:14.280 --> 14:17.320
No. Release him... for now.

14:21.480 --> 14:22.400
Majesty.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.560
We should make plans
for the New Year.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.560
Yes, your majesty.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.960
I would like to invite
the Lady Mary to court.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.280
Is that one all right?

14:37.280 --> 14:39.240
I'd also like to
invite Anne of Cleves

14:39.320 --> 14:40.880
for New Year's celebrations.

14:41.720 --> 14:43.720
Bring that through.
Fasten it here.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.520
That's it.
Bring it around this way.

14:45.520 --> 14:46.440
Two rods!

14:57.720 --> 15:00.280
My Lady, here are your
presents from the King.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.440
Presents!

15:09.200 --> 15:10.720
So beautiful!

15:12.320 --> 15:16.080
Look! So shiny! Smell!

15:18.840 --> 15:21.040
Smells of roses! It's lovely.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.040
It's perfect!

15:30.480 --> 15:32.320
My Lady! Look!

15:33.760 --> 15:35.240
Oh my goodness!

15:38.600 --> 15:40.600
His Majesty spoils you!

15:40.600 --> 15:42.040
I know he does!

15:43.200 --> 15:45.000
But am I not worth it?

15:47.400 --> 15:48.760
Feel it, it's so soft.

15:51.640 --> 15:54.560
I am the Queen of England.

15:55.360 --> 15:58.160
Oh gold! I love gold!

16:02.160 --> 16:03.320
It goes with my dress.

16:05.960 --> 16:09.000
- Happy Christmas, Ladies.
- Happy Christmas, your Majesty.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.520
Where are we going?

16:12.520 --> 16:13.600
There are more presents.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.400
More?!

16:23.560 --> 16:24.680
What do you think?

16:25.400 --> 16:26.920
They're beautiful.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.840
They were sent ahead by
Anne of Cleves as a gift.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.560
She arrives tomorrow.

16:33.520 --> 16:34.760
Anne of Cleves?

16:35.760 --> 16:38.040
Yes. I've invited
her for New Year.

16:38.800 --> 16:39.920
You don't mind, do you?

16:40.960 --> 16:42.840
No, of course I don't mind.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.880
Your Majesty must do as you will.

16:53.160 --> 16:55.840
But... will I like her,

16:56.600 --> 16:58.000
this Anne of Cleves?

16:59.000 --> 17:00.080
Wait and see.

17:05.119 --> 17:07.960
I hope the Lady Mary will be
more gracious than before.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.040
My Lords, Lady Mary.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.320
Your majesty.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.080
My beautiful daughter, Mary.

17:42.760 --> 17:43.960
Say hello to the Queen.

17:50.120 --> 17:51.080
Madam.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.800
Lady Mary. I am very glad
to see you back at court.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.440
Thank you for my gifts.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.600
Your Majesty, as always,
is more than generous.

18:00.520 --> 18:01.400
Charles.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.200
Lady Anne.

18:37.840 --> 18:38.880
Your Grace.

18:45.640 --> 18:48.000
I remember that you once
taught me to play cards.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.080
I am very grateful.

18:50.480 --> 18:53.440
As a result of your tuition,
I have won a fortune!

18:59.800 --> 19:01.120
My Lords,

19:01.160 --> 19:03.200
Lady Anne of Cleves!

19:21.320 --> 19:22.280
Lady Anne,

19:24.720 --> 19:26.080
welcome to my court.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.600
Your majesty! Happy Christmas.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.800
Allow me to introduce
to you my new wife,

19:33.800 --> 19:34.800
Queen Katherine.

19:35.000 --> 19:35.960
Lady Anne.

19:36.840 --> 19:37.960
Your majesty.

19:38.640 --> 19:40.040
What a great privilege

19:40.040 --> 19:42.920
and honour it is for me
to be presented to you.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.280
I am so delighted.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.680
You are very welcome to court,
Lady Anne.

19:49.560 --> 19:52.440
We thank you so much for the
two fine horses you sent,

19:52.440 --> 19:55.360
and wish you a very
happy New Year.

19:55.520 --> 19:56.840
Thank you, your Majesty.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.400
I think we should all be merry!

20:00.400 --> 20:01.280
Yes!

20:16.360 --> 20:19.000
Ladies. Excellency.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.200
You are not well?

20:22.680 --> 20:25.800
These days I suffer a
little from gout, Lady Mary.

20:26.480 --> 20:28.400
- Please sit.
- Thank you.

20:36.120 --> 20:39.800
You are and always have
been my most faithful

20:41.280 --> 20:43.400
and truest friend
in all this world.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.960
I could not bear it if you
were ever to leave here.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.480
He ought not to have
divorced the Lady Anne.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.560
Now that I know her better,

21:01.560 --> 21:04.280
I think she is perfectly
sweet and gracious.

21:04.280 --> 21:05.960
Nevertheless, Lady Mary,

21:06.200 --> 21:09.640
I fear that you will have to
reconcile yourself to the new Queen.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.440
No, I will not. I hate her.

21:14.760 --> 21:19.400
Then, perhaps, after all,
you do not require my advice any more.

21:37.320 --> 21:40.720
My Lady, I wanted to ask if you
had any news of my brother Edward?

21:41.120 --> 21:44.400
He's well enough. Cold, but well.

21:44.960 --> 21:46.920
Wet, but well.

21:47.720 --> 21:51.040
Apparently, it always rains in the north,
and the mud is free.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.600
Will he see some action?

21:52.960 --> 21:56.480
I believe he intends to punish the
Scots for their terrible wickedness.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.280
That sounds very like my brother.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.640
If only you could be more
like him, Sir Thomas.

22:02.360 --> 22:03.280
What do you mean?

22:05.120 --> 22:07.440
My husband always
takes what he wants.

22:17.480 --> 22:18.680
Ladies, you must forgive me.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.560
I rode out early to hunt this
morning and am very tired.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.680
We shall dine again
together tomorrow evening.

22:24.680 --> 22:26.040
- Lady Anne.
- Your majesty.

22:26.440 --> 22:27.480
My beautiful wife.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.040
Now, I must insist you
stay to enjoy the dancing.

22:34.080 --> 22:34.840
Boy.

22:35.960 --> 22:36.880
Boy!

22:42.600 --> 22:43.520
Lady Mary!

22:47.680 --> 22:50.480
I bid you all a good night.
Happy New Year!

22:50.480 --> 22:52.520
[All]: Happy New Year,
Your Majesty!

23:03.080 --> 23:06.560
I wonder... will you have
some more wine, Lady Anne?

23:06.560 --> 23:09.160
With pleasure,
if your Majesty will.

23:09.760 --> 23:10.440
Yes.

23:11.240 --> 23:12.160
Wine.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.080
Your majesty.

23:16.080 --> 23:16.880
Thank you!

23:19.240 --> 23:20.160
Lady Anne.

23:26.280 --> 23:29.280
His Majesty tells me
that his daughter,

23:29.280 --> 23:31.800
the Lady Elizabeth,
sometimes comes to see you.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.080
How do you find her?

23:37.760 --> 23:39.880
Oh, she is charming.

23:40.040 --> 23:42.360
So clever. And so beautiful.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.280
And so very affectionate.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.720
It is always a
pleasure to see her.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.880
You see, I have no
desire to remarry,

23:56.400 --> 23:59.600
so I am sure I will never
have any children of my own.

24:00.120 --> 24:03.960
I think a little that Elizabeth
is like a daughter to me.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.600
Surely it is so:

24:06.600 --> 24:09.240
To have had her as a
daughter would have been

24:09.240 --> 24:12.960
a greater happiness to
me than ever being Queen.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.240
Jesus Christ!

24:53.560 --> 24:54.440
That's better.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.520
May I ask Your Majesty a question?

25:13.680 --> 25:14.760
Go on.

25:16.160 --> 25:19.440
Why did your Majesty invite Lady
Anne of Cleves for Christmas?

25:27.680 --> 25:29.000
I like her, after all.

25:29.840 --> 25:31.600
She keeps her promises, boy.

25:55.360 --> 25:57.160
Majesty? Come!

27:12.440 --> 27:17.800
So, what did this
Joan Bulmer tell you?

27:20.760 --> 27:24.640
She said that

27:24.640 --> 27:29.560
on the nights Dereham
visited Katherine's bed,

27:29.600 --> 27:32.800
he would bring with him wine,

27:32.800 --> 27:36.080
strawberries, and apples,

27:36.080 --> 27:41.960
and other things
to make good cheer.

27:42.920 --> 27:45.000
And then?

27:46.840 --> 27:50.400
Then...

28:01.520 --> 28:03.800
What then?

28:07.640 --> 28:09.360
There would be kissing

28:09.360 --> 28:15.960
and... he would pull down his
hose and lie down with her.

28:16.640 --> 28:18.920
And the two of them would

28:18.920 --> 28:23.160
hang by their bellies
like two sparrows.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.040
Come here.

28:41.640 --> 28:43.600
"And the two of
them would hang by

28:43.600 --> 28:48.920
their bellies
like two sparrows."

29:03.960 --> 29:06.440
Why are you here?

29:06.800 --> 29:09.200
Taking what I want.

29:09.720 --> 29:12.240
Just like my brother does.

29:12.240 --> 29:15.160
Just like he's always done.

29:18.800 --> 29:22.080
And what if I don't want it?

29:22.080 --> 29:25.240
What if I call my servants?

29:25.240 --> 29:28.520
You won't. And you know why?

29:28.520 --> 29:33.160
Because you hate my brother.

29:33.160 --> 29:37.520
You hate him almost
as much as I hate him

29:37.520 --> 29:39.960
but you can't tell anyone

29:39.960 --> 29:42.680
except me.

30:25.480 --> 30:31.000
Well, Mr. Seymour,

30:33.480 --> 30:36.920
come into my bed.

30:42.520 --> 30:46.000
Enjoy what your brother enjoys.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.680
It will be interesting
to compare you.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.840
Credo in unum Deum
patris omnipotentum.

30:57.840 --> 31:02.160
Credo in unum Deum patris

31:02.160 --> 31:03.920
Patris omnipotentum.

31:03.920 --> 31:07.640
My Lady! My Lady!
The Queen is here!

31:26.240 --> 31:30.600
Lady Mary, I have come here
in person to ask you

31:30.600 --> 31:34.080
why you will not show me the
respect which, as Queen of England,

31:34.080 --> 31:37.160
I am entitled to
expect, even from you.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.040
I noticed, as did everyone else,

31:40.040 --> 31:42.640
that you show the greatest respect
to the Lady Anne of Cleves,

31:42.640 --> 31:46.000
even though she is now just a
private person and worth no account.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.680
Forgive me. But surely
the Lady Anne is

31:48.680 --> 31:51.040
worthy of every respect?

31:51.040 --> 31:53.360
She carries herself
with great dignity

31:53.360 --> 31:55.480
and also modesty,

31:55.480 --> 31:59.280
and desires nothing more than
to please the King, her Lord.

31:59.320 --> 32:01.800
Do you mean I do not
try to please him?

32:01.800 --> 32:04.440
I think you desire almost
nothing else than pleasure!

32:04.480 --> 32:06.680
It pleases you, it seems,
to do nothing but wear

32:06.680 --> 32:08.880
pretty clothes and dance.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.280
Some people may
think that frivolous

32:11.280 --> 32:14.720
in the consort of a King,
whose flesh is also sacred.

32:14.840 --> 32:17.280
If his Majesty thought
me only frivolous,

32:17.280 --> 32:19.480
why did he marry me?

32:20.400 --> 32:22.400
You are thought

32:22.400 --> 32:25.000
capable of bearing sons.

32:25.680 --> 32:28.240
Unfortunately,
for all the King's attentions,

32:28.240 --> 32:31.320
I see you are still not pregnant.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.680
In any case,
he will soon tire of you.

32:34.680 --> 32:36.680
You'll see.

32:39.640 --> 32:42.160
And what about you?

32:45.360 --> 32:47.360
And what about me?

32:47.400 --> 32:49.680
I think you're jealous.

32:49.680 --> 32:52.320
You're jealous because
you're much older than me

32:52.320 --> 32:55.200
and you're still not married.

32:56.040 --> 33:01.000
Perhaps you'll never be married,
and will grow old a maid!

33:04.560 --> 33:07.560
How dare you speak
to me like that.

33:08.560 --> 33:11.600
I dare because I can.

33:13.360 --> 33:16.280
And I can do something else, too.

33:16.280 --> 33:18.880
As punishment for
your lack of respect

33:18.880 --> 33:21.360
towards his Majesty's wife,

33:21.360 --> 33:23.800
I am removing two of your
maids from your service.

33:23.800 --> 33:26.360
A good day to you, Lady Mary.

33:46.760 --> 33:48.880
Here's to love.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.520
To Katherine, Queen of England.

33:52.520 --> 33:56.280
And, God willing, may you
soon be ripe with children.

33:56.280 --> 34:00.440
Thank you. Both of you.

34:00.760 --> 34:03.320
You are so kind, Lady Anne

34:03.320 --> 34:06.600
and my gracious lord.

34:09.000 --> 34:14.880
I am the most happy I have
ever been in my whole life.

34:17.080 --> 34:19.040
I have a gift for you.

34:27.280 --> 34:29.600
Oh my God!

34:31.280 --> 34:33.600
May I please see it, your Majesty?

34:37.400 --> 34:40.880
Oh, what's this?
Not more presents?!

34:40.880 --> 34:42.320
Do you like them?

34:42.320 --> 34:44.560
Oh, I just adore them.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.840
They're so pretty.

34:52.480 --> 34:55.239
- Oh! But...
- But?

34:55.239 --> 34:58.120
With your Majesty's permission,
I would like

34:58.120 --> 35:00.880
to share these gifts
with the Lady Anne.

35:00.880 --> 35:04.200
With me?! No!

35:04.960 --> 35:06.760
May I?

35:07.080 --> 35:08.360
Of course.

35:09.160 --> 35:11.880
Oh, thank you!

35:12.200 --> 35:13.760
So sweet!

35:13.760 --> 35:15.240
They're yours.

35:15.800 --> 35:19.720
- Thank you, Katherine!
- Happy New Year, Lady Anne,

35:22.720 --> 35:24.160
Hello!

35:24.440 --> 35:28.760
Hello. Isn't he sweet?

35:39.360 --> 35:40.400
Lady Mary!

35:40.400 --> 35:41.720
What are you doing?

35:42.120 --> 35:43.920
I'm going back to Hunsdon.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.600
Have you asked his
Majesty's permission?

35:47.120 --> 35:48.960
Why are you leaving?

35:48.960 --> 35:50.560
Haven't you heard?

35:50.560 --> 35:53.000
She has removed two of my maids!

35:53.760 --> 35:55.360
The Queen?

35:55.720 --> 35:58.680
Apparently I don't treat her
with sufficient respect.

35:58.680 --> 36:02.040
Madam, please.
I am sure if you found some

36:02.080 --> 36:04.480
small means to
conciliate the Queen,

36:04.480 --> 36:06.440
then the maids would probably
be allowed to remain...

36:06.440 --> 36:08.360
No! Why should I?

36:08.360 --> 36:10.880
I don't want to conciliate her.

36:30.360 --> 36:32.480
What did she say to you?

36:33.360 --> 36:35.400
She said...

36:36.120 --> 36:38.840
that I'm jealous of her.

36:39.800 --> 36:44.160
Because she is married

36:45.400 --> 36:47.760
and I'm not.

36:55.240 --> 36:57.760
And may never be.

36:59.240 --> 37:01.320
She ought not to have
said such things.

37:01.320 --> 37:06.080
No, but they're true!

37:07.320 --> 37:09.400
They're true!

37:33.160 --> 37:35.560
My sweet Lady.

37:36.720 --> 37:39.680
My poor sweet Lady.

37:51.960 --> 37:53.560
Lady Rochford.

38:01.320 --> 38:04.160
How is the King today, Mr.
Culpepper?

38:04.160 --> 38:05.840
He is very well, your Majesty.

38:06.320 --> 38:07.720
He sends you his love and

38:07.720 --> 38:09.920
hopes you are well looked
after and entertained?

38:10.720 --> 38:13.640
I wanted to go riding today
but the weather was too bad.

38:13.640 --> 38:15.640
I'm very sorry to hear it.

38:21.840 --> 38:23.880
His Majesty wants you to know

38:23.880 --> 38:26.120
that the military campaign
against the Scots has

38:26.120 --> 38:29.760
been a great success, and he is
most pleased with Lord Hertford

38:29.760 --> 38:32.520
and his other Captains,
who performed well in the field.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.640
Which field?

38:35.640 --> 38:37.640
It means the battlefield.

38:37.640 --> 38:41.000
Ah. I'm glad.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.280
- Glad?
- That they did so well.

38:44.360 --> 38:46.600
In the field.

38:51.160 --> 38:56.040
Is there anything else,
Mr. Culpepper?

38:59.960 --> 39:03.320
Yes, yes. This book.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
It was written by
one Richard Jonas,

39:07.000 --> 39:08.840
who came here to England in
the train of Anne of Cleves,

39:08.840 --> 39:10.840
and obviously meant to
dedicate it to his mistress.

39:10.840 --> 39:13.200
But now, with your
Majesty's permission,

39:13.200 --> 39:14.760
he would like to
dedicate it to you.

39:14.760 --> 39:17.360
What is it? Give it me.

39:19.520 --> 39:24.920
"The Byrthe of Mankind"?

39:24.920 --> 39:26.680
I believe it's the
first major work

39:26.680 --> 39:28.400
on midwifery to be
written in English.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.080
Midwifery?

39:43.200 --> 39:47.240
Mr. Jonas would now like to
dedicate it to the most gracious

39:47.240 --> 39:52.200
and in all goodness,
most excellent, virtuous lady,

40:08.160 --> 40:11.600
Oh! Thomas!

40:28.200 --> 40:30.280
I wonder what it would feel like?

40:30.280 --> 40:32.520
What what would feel like?

40:33.280 --> 40:34.880
I suppose I should go
down to her with wine,

40:34.880 --> 40:36.480
apples, and strawberries,

40:36.480 --> 40:37.920
although they are
all out of season.

40:37.920 --> 40:41.600
Who are you talking about?

40:42.600 --> 40:45.200
Who do you think
I'm talking about?

40:46.840 --> 40:50.600
Hanging by their bellies
like two sparrows!

41:05.640 --> 41:08.720
- Do you really want to?
- What?

41:13.680 --> 41:15.600
If you do,

41:17.640 --> 41:21.000
I could arrange it.

41:40.760 --> 41:42.120
My Lord.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.880
- Thank God, your Grace!
- What's happened?

41:55.880 --> 41:56.720
Come. Come!

41:58.880 --> 42:00.480
How bad is it?

42:00.480 --> 42:02.120
Your Grace, the ulcer on his

42:02.120 --> 42:04.440
Majesty's leg has unfortunately
become clogged again.

42:04.480 --> 42:05.840
We have no option but to

42:05.840 --> 42:08.440
drain off the fluid which
has collected there.

42:08.520 --> 42:12.000
Otherwise... we fear for
his Majesty's life!

42:20.560 --> 42:22.800
Forgive me, Majesty...

42:45.640 --> 42:48.240
This is worse than ever before,
your Grace.

42:48.240 --> 42:50.360
What happens if the
King should die?

42:50.440 --> 42:53.800
Your Grace must pray to
heaven that he does not.

42:53.800 --> 42:56.320
But he looks likely to die!

42:56.320 --> 42:58.280
That is what I'm afraid of.

43:34.080 --> 43:39.680
My Lords, I assure you that
I am not content.

43:40.240 --> 43:42.800
I have relied upon you

43:42.800 --> 43:46.560
to inform and counsel me

43:46.560 --> 43:50.200
and yet I am the most deceived.

43:50.280 --> 43:55.040
I have trusted and
favoured all of you.

43:55.960 --> 44:00.680
I have formed a
sinister opinion...

44:01.720 --> 44:04.840
that most of you are liars

44:04.840 --> 44:10.440
and flatterers who look
only to your own profits.

44:10.440 --> 44:13.160
I know what you are plotting.

44:13.160 --> 44:16.480
And if God gives me the strength,

44:16.480 --> 44:19.640
I will see to it that none

44:19.640 --> 44:24.560
of your projects ever succeed!

44:25.320 --> 44:28.800
I mourn Cromwell's death.

44:28.880 --> 44:32.440
Yes! I mourn him.

44:32.440 --> 44:36.920
I mourn him now that I
perceive my Councillors,

44:36.920 --> 44:42.400
by light pretext,
and by false accusations,

44:42.400 --> 44:49.760
made me put to death the most
faithful servant I ever had.

45:00.240 --> 45:02.600
Culpepper.

45:19.600 --> 45:21.920
Your Majesty, Mr.
Culpepper is here.

45:21.920 --> 45:24.360
Thank God! May I see his Majesty?

45:24.360 --> 45:28.240
Forgive me, my Lady,
but his Majesty remains indisposed.

45:28.720 --> 45:29.560
He sends you his love...

45:29.600 --> 45:31.840
and this as a token of it.

45:32.760 --> 45:35.480
I thank his Majesty, but...

45:35.480 --> 45:39.040
It is ten days since I have
been allowed into his presence.

45:39.040 --> 45:41.440
Why will he not see me? Why?

45:41.440 --> 45:44.560
Have I offended him in some way?
What have I done?

45:45.720 --> 45:47.720
He cannot love me so much

45:47.720 --> 45:50.960
if he can so easily neglect me!

45:51.960 --> 45:54.560
Perhaps he has taken a mistress!

45:56.720 --> 45:59.080
Has he taken a mistress,
Master Culpepper?

45:59.120 --> 46:01.120
Is that why he won't see me?

46:02.200 --> 46:04.920
I cannot answer your Majesty.
I'm sorry.

46:06.680 --> 46:09.320
Is he with his mistress now?

46:13.960 --> 46:17.040
Very well. You may go,
since you will not tell me anything,

46:17.040 --> 46:21.000
even though you see how
unhappy and miserable I am!

46:22.880 --> 46:25.920
You know I would do
anything in the world,

46:26.520 --> 46:28.000
anything...

46:28.000 --> 46:31.200
To bring you comfort
and make you happy.

46:31.200 --> 46:35.320
More than any other woman,
you deserve to be happy.

47:20.640 --> 47:23.440
Mr. Culpepper is so handsome.

47:27.120 --> 47:29.800
He's in love with you.

47:33.160 --> 47:34.560
In love?

47:35.680 --> 47:39.280
Yes. He has confessed everything.

47:39.280 --> 47:43.120
He loves you madly.
He told me so. He said

47:43.120 --> 47:46.000
he would happily die for you!

47:46.000 --> 47:48.960
And that he thinks
and dreams of you

47:48.960 --> 47:51.200
day and night.

48:18.760 --> 48:19.960
Surrey has written
a poem about us,

48:19.960 --> 48:21.520
which is circulating the court.

48:21.520 --> 48:23.080
About us?

48:25.240 --> 48:26.640
What does he say?

48:27.080 --> 48:29.240
He calls you the wolf lady.

48:29.240 --> 48:31.520
Naturally, he is the lion.

48:31.520 --> 48:33.160
He says you tried to entrap him

48:33.160 --> 48:36.480
but he is too noble a beast to
be tangled by such cunning hooks!

48:36.880 --> 48:40.080
He also warns you that if you
should cross his path again,

48:40.080 --> 48:43.040
he will feed on you as
you meant to feed on him.

48:44.640 --> 48:49.800
Oh, and he says that we rose
high by murdering the innocent!

49:54.440 --> 49:57.600
<i>Culpepper: You know I'd do
anything in the world,</i>

49:59.400 --> 50:04.600
<i>anything... to bring you comfort.</i>

50:42.840 --> 50:47.000
He wants to visit you. Privately.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.960
Who?

50:50.920 --> 50:52.760
Culpepper.

50:54.960 --> 50:59.040
He can't! That's not possible.

50:59.040 --> 51:01.000
Of course he can!

51:01.520 --> 51:05.560
Just like that other one...
coming to you at night.

51:08.520 --> 51:10.720
You know about that?

51:10.720 --> 51:12.680
Of course I know.

51:12.680 --> 51:15.080
Joan Bulmer told me.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.400
And it can be just the same.

51:18.960 --> 51:21.160
A secret.

51:21.160 --> 51:23.840
Nobody else need ever know...

51:24.640 --> 51:26.680
not the King,

51:28.440 --> 51:30.920
not anybody!

51:46.920 --> 51:48.960
Are you sure?

52:08.640 --> 52:11.680
Come! Come!
