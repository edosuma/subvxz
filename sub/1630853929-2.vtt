07:36.189 --> 07:37.857
with Lyme disease,
she used to sleep

07:37.924 --> 07:39.525
on Heather's coach
all the time,

07:39.592 --> 07:40.993
so she's really attached to it.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.529
That's the couch
that I always sleep on.

07:43.596 --> 07:45.765
I have the best night's sleep
on that couch.

07:45.832 --> 07:47.700
Because of that, do you want
to keep it in the space?

07:47.767 --> 07:49.235
I feel like
we're here to upgrade

07:49.302 --> 07:51.204
-Heather's life.
-SABRINA: Yeah.

07:51.270 --> 07:52.238
And I think we can do better
than that couch.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.706
Everything goes.

07:53.773 --> 07:55.174
<i>DEBBIE:</i>
<i>The renovation is</i>

07:55.241 --> 07:57.043
<i>not about me.</i>
<i>It is about Heather,</i>

07:57.109 --> 08:00.112
<i>and she is entrusting me to do</i>

08:00.179 --> 08:03.616
<i>the modern farmhouse look,</i>
<i>which she loves so much.</i>

08:03.683 --> 08:05.952
Heather likes, like,
a very clean palette, but

08:06.018 --> 08:07.253
just, like, a pop of color
here and there.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.223
-That's my jam. Really.
-I know.
-(whoops)

08:10.289 --> 08:12.058
<i>SABRINA:</i>
<i>Heather loves to entertain,</i>

08:12.124 --> 08:13.626
<i>so we'll start</i>
<i>the transformation</i>

08:13.693 --> 08:15.962
<i>in the living room</i>
<i>with all-new furniture,</i>

08:16.028 --> 08:19.232
<i>a stylish chandelier,</i>
<i>a framed TV</i>

08:19.298 --> 08:21.801
<i>and plenty of accent pieces to</i>
<i>bring the whole room together.</i>

08:23.035 --> 08:24.570
I'm noticing structurally

08:24.637 --> 08:27.240
this division
down the center of the room.

08:27.306 --> 08:30.209
This beam here actually looks
like a load-supporting beam,

08:30.276 --> 08:32.245
so the beam is probably
gonna have to stay.

08:32.311 --> 08:34.280
-DEBBIE: Gonna have to stay.
-ROB: But I feel like

08:34.347 --> 08:37.583
this cabinet, the microwave,
all at eye level--

08:37.650 --> 08:40.753
if we took this down, it would
really open up the room.

08:40.820 --> 08:42.755
DEBBIE:
Yeah.

08:42.822 --> 08:43.990
<i>Heather is really tired</i>
<i>of all the cherry cabinets,</i>

08:44.056 --> 08:46.959
so I'd like to donate
and replace these.

08:48.294 --> 08:50.263
<i>SABRINA:</i>
<i>Heather loves to entertain</i>

08:50.329 --> 08:52.031
<i>so I want to create</i>
<i>a huge kitchen island</i>

08:52.098 --> 08:53.799
<i>where everybody hangs out,</i>

08:53.866 --> 08:55.735
which means I have
to move a few things around.

08:55.801 --> 08:58.070
<i>We know Heather would like</i>
<i>a modern farmhouse kitchen,</i>

08:58.137 --> 09:00.239
<i>so we'll take out</i>
<i>the old countertops,</i>

09:00.306 --> 09:02.241
<i>the appliances</i>
<i>and all those cherry cabinets</i>

09:02.308 --> 09:04.810
<i>that Heather does not like.</i>

09:04.877 --> 09:07.546
<i>With the low-hanging</i>
<i>dividing cabinets out of the way</i>

09:07.613 --> 09:09.749
<i>and the space</i>
<i>completely opened up,</i>

09:09.815 --> 09:11.617
<i>our transformation</i>
<i>will continue</i>

09:11.684 --> 09:13.686
<i>by installing beautiful</i>
<i>white cabinets</i>

09:13.753 --> 09:16.889
<i>and spacious countertops</i>
<i>and a classic backsplash.</i>

09:16.956 --> 09:20.293
<i>We'll place a new range and</i>
<i>hood where the sink used to be,</i>

09:20.359 --> 09:22.261
<i>bring back in</i>
<i>the original refrigerator</i>

09:22.328 --> 09:24.030
<i>that Heather loves,</i>

09:24.096 --> 09:25.765
<i>and then she can get ready</i>
<i>to entertain</i>

09:25.831 --> 09:28.801
<i>because we're building Heather</i>
<i>a huge center island</i>

09:28.868 --> 09:32.038
<i>complete with a deep-basin sink,</i>
<i>new dishwasher,</i>

09:32.104 --> 09:35.107
<i>under-counter microwave</i>
<i>and beautiful pendant lighting.</i>

09:35.174 --> 09:36.642
<i>Where the dining room used</i>
<i>to be,</i>

09:36.709 --> 09:38.678
<i>there will be stylish stools,</i>

09:38.744 --> 09:41.814
<i>plus a large new pantry</i>
<i>to provide plenty of storage.</i>

09:41.881 --> 09:44.717
So if we move the dining room
over here...

09:44.784 --> 09:46.152
How are you even
gonna have room?

09:46.218 --> 09:47.353
It doesn't feel like
it's big enough.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.322
Because this is...
this fireplace here.

09:49.388 --> 09:50.656
But this is a plug-in,
so it's basically a piece

09:50.723 --> 09:51.924
of furniture
that can be moved.

09:51.991 --> 09:52.992
You can send this
to Vegas, too.

09:53.059 --> 09:53.993
-Yes.
-ROB: Right on.

09:54.060 --> 09:55.628
So this is going to Vegas,

09:55.695 --> 09:57.163
and the front room sofa's
going to Vegas.

09:57.229 --> 09:59.065
Yeah, this is gonna
create my set-up there.

09:59.131 --> 10:01.667
The floors are in good shape,
but what if we

10:01.734 --> 10:04.837
just refinish them,
see what color we can pull out,

10:04.904 --> 10:06.138
even if it's, like,
a warm gray?

10:06.205 --> 10:08.074
-ROB: Sand 'em down.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:08.140 --> 10:10.676
Modern farmhouse.
That's right up that alley.

10:10.743 --> 10:12.178
I'm getting excited for her.

10:12.244 --> 10:13.346
-It's not even my house.
-I know, me, too.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.848
I'm gonna come back
and visit more.

10:15.915 --> 10:18.084
<i>SABRINA:</i>
<i>To finish off the facelift</i>
<i>to modern farmhouse,</i>

10:18.150 --> 10:21.320
<i>we'll sand down</i>
<i>all those yellowing oak floors</i>

10:21.387 --> 10:23.856
<i>and give them a beautiful</i>
<i>light grey stain.</i>

10:23.923 --> 10:26.025
<i>Then we'll transform</i>
<i>Heather's old TV room</i>

10:26.092 --> 10:27.827
<i>into a brand-new dining room,</i>

10:27.893 --> 10:30.629
<i>complete with a custom-built</i>
<i>wooden table and seating</i>

10:30.696 --> 10:34.700
<i>and plenty of the pictures</i>
<i>and artwork that Heather love.</i>

10:34.767 --> 10:36.369
We got to get started. We got
to clear all this stuff out.

10:36.435 --> 10:39.372
Yup, and when the dust starts
to fly, I say "goodbye," so...

10:39.438 --> 10:41.240
-(laughter)
-I love that.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.875
<i>SABRINA:</i>
<i>As Nischelle heads out,</i>

10:42.942 --> 10:45.711
<i>now it's time to get busy.</i>

10:45.778 --> 10:49.248
<i>We have to turn this house</i>
<i>into Heather's dream home.</i>

10:50.249 --> 10:52.251
What's this here, Deb?

10:52.318 --> 10:55.087
That is a very,
very special glass.

10:55.154 --> 10:58.024
To celebrate my mama, Diane,
we had these

10:58.090 --> 10:59.925
<i>at her service.</i>

10:59.992 --> 11:02.361
<i>Her favorite drink was</i>
<i>always a vodka gimlet,</i>

11:02.428 --> 11:04.196
so we wanted...

11:04.263 --> 11:06.198
Ah, sorry. It's a challenging,
difficult memory.

11:06.265 --> 11:08.901
Um, we wanted to be able
to do a cheers

11:08.968 --> 11:13.039
to Lady Di,
and, uh, we did it with this,

11:13.105 --> 11:16.275
and Heather obviously kept hers
in a safe place.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.943
And maybe when this is all done,

11:18.010 --> 11:20.346
we can do a big
vodka gimlet cheers.

11:20.413 --> 11:21.714
-That sounds like fun.
-How does that sound?

11:21.781 --> 11:23.215
Sounds great.

11:23.282 --> 11:25.317
I could tell
that being in Heather's house

11:25.384 --> 11:26.986
<i>and packing up all these things</i>

11:27.053 --> 11:28.821
<i>just brought out a ton</i>
<i>of memories for Debbie.</i>

11:28.888 --> 11:30.990
Whoa. You guys want
to see some fun pictures?

11:31.057 --> 11:32.825
-Yes. Okay.
-Come here. Come here.

11:32.892 --> 11:34.860
-Here's me and Heather.
-Oh.

11:34.927 --> 11:37.797
-When we were both
kind of brunettey.
-(Sabrina laughs)

11:37.863 --> 11:38.998
This was the opening
of<i> Beauty and the Beast</i>

11:39.065 --> 11:40.833
<i>on Broadway.</i>

11:40.900 --> 11:43.135
<i>I starred in that.</i>
<i>Heather was there.</i>

11:43.202 --> 11:45.004
Okay, so I looked at this and
thought it was me and Heather,

11:45.071 --> 11:47.039
-but it's Heather and my mom.
-SABRINA: Oh, my God.

11:47.106 --> 11:48.741
-DEBBIE: Like, we just look
so much alike, right?
-ROB: Wow.

11:48.808 --> 11:53.179
<i>DEBBIE: I just know that I have</i>
<i>this unwavering support</i>

11:53.245 --> 11:55.981
<i>in Heather.</i>
<i>I have a true teammate,</i>

11:56.048 --> 11:58.350
like I had with my mom.

11:58.417 --> 12:03.089
And it is so rare to have that
twice in a lifetime,

12:03.155 --> 12:04.957
and I'm-I'm so lucky.

12:08.294 --> 12:09.895

-Yeah.
-Oh, my gosh!

12:11.831 --> 12:14.800
-Safety first.
-Yes, please.

12:14.867 --> 12:17.203
As an eighth-grader,
I wanted to be Debbie Gibson,

12:17.269 --> 12:18.904
<i>so me working with her</i>
<i>and demoing with her--</i>

12:18.971 --> 12:20.506

Now she's on my turf.

12:22.341 --> 12:23.843
-That's backwards.
-Is it backwards?

12:23.909 --> 12:25.778
You got it on backwards, Deb.

12:25.845 --> 12:27.513
Oh, I thought
it was, like, really...

12:27.580 --> 12:28.881
I was like, "This feels
really secure." I was happy.

12:28.948 --> 12:30.816
-Is that it?
-That's it.

12:30.883 --> 12:32.751
I don't... What do I know about
how to put on a hard hat?

12:32.818 --> 12:34.487

<i>She knows as much</i>
<i>about hard hats</i>

12:34.553 --> 12:37.123

about singing on Broadway.

salvageable.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.060
-Mm?
-So we're just gonna...

12:41.127 --> 12:42.761
swing down and break it.

12:42.828 --> 12:45.865
Okay. Like, on this part
or that part?

12:45.931 --> 12:47.800
-That's...
-Like, the edge or here?

12:47.867 --> 12:49.235
-Anywhere?
-Just hit it. Just hit it.

15:41.206 --> 15:43.108
I have no words.

15:43.175 --> 15:44.610
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>I've actually never</i>

15:44.677 --> 15:46.945
<i>seen it done like that before,</i>
<i>but</i>

15:47.012 --> 15:49.081
I wanted it opened up,
and he opened it up.

15:49.148 --> 15:51.283
It looks like
a whole different place already.

15:51.350 --> 15:53.452
And imagine how much bigger
the island's gonna be,

15:53.519 --> 15:56.722
and people can sit, eat,
talk while she's cooking.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.590
-It's gonna be
a whole new experience.
-Yes.

15:58.657 --> 16:00.659
It'll definitely be
a better place to gather.

16:00.726 --> 16:02.361
<i>SABRINA:</i>
<i>It definitely saved time</i>

16:02.428 --> 16:03.662
because the rest
of the countertops

16:03.729 --> 16:05.998
and the cabinets
are getting donated.

16:06.065 --> 16:08.033
-This piece here can definitely
be reused.
-Want to keep it?

16:08.100 --> 16:09.702
<i>SABRINA:</i>
<i>So we need to get those</i>
<i>out of the house</i>

16:09.768 --> 16:12.237
<i>carefully,</i>
<i>along with the furniture.</i>

16:12.304 --> 16:14.540
<i>ROB: So my guys were</i>
<i>ripping out everything</i>

16:14.606 --> 16:16.375
<i>so we can start</i>
<i>with a clean slate.</i>

16:16.442 --> 16:19.378
<i>The trim, the backsplash.</i>

16:19.445 --> 16:21.180
<i>But when we started</i>
<i>ripping out all the drywall,</i>

16:21.246 --> 16:22.348
we ran into an issue.

16:22.414 --> 16:24.149
What's going on?

16:24.216 --> 16:25.451
So, we've ripped down
the-the sheetrock

16:25.517 --> 16:27.453
to get these cans out of here.

16:27.519 --> 16:29.321
We're measuring down.

16:29.388 --> 16:30.756
They're completely off.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.092
-Nothing's-nothing's square
or level.
-Okay.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.260
<i>So when they built this kitchn</i>
<i>ceiling, it just wasn't level.</i>

16:35.327 --> 16:37.262
So what they did was
they shimmed it

16:37.329 --> 16:39.732
with little pieces of wood,
which really isn't ideal.

16:39.798 --> 16:42.167
What if we put some two-by-fours

16:42.234 --> 16:44.403
and ripped 'em on the table saw
the long way,

16:44.470 --> 16:47.473
-and put it up there,
get it all level?
-Yeah.

16:47.539 --> 16:49.675
It's not a structural issue,

16:49.742 --> 16:52.344
-but I think it's important
if everything looks flat.
-Flat.

16:52.411 --> 16:54.246
By ripping some two-by-fours,

16:54.313 --> 16:56.648
<i>we'll be able</i>
<i>to level this ceiling properly.</i>

16:57.449 --> 17:00.352
<i>And the ceiling went in</i>
<i>perfectly level.</i>

17:04.490 --> 17:06.392
<i>As I'm checking out</i>
<i>the rest of the house,</i>

17:06.458 --> 17:08.427
<i>I made a very cool discovery.</i>

17:08.494 --> 17:10.462
-Hey, Sabrina?
-Yeah.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.164
-Check this out.
-This is it.

17:12.231 --> 17:14.233
Is this what
you were telling me about?

17:14.299 --> 17:17.436
This is the piano that Debbie
wrote "Lost in Your Eyes" on.

she grew up with.

17:44.363 --> 17:45.664
ROB:
Oh, my goodness.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.332
I'd love
to get this thing polished,

17:47.399 --> 17:49.501
tuned up and back in action.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.203
Do you want me
to play you something?

17:51.270 --> 17:53.672
-Yeah, I would love that.
-This is gonna blow your mind.

17:53.739 --> 17:58.510
(playing Scott Joplin's
"The Entertainer")

17:58.577 --> 18:00.479
(laughs)
That's actually good.

18:00.546 --> 18:02.514
-No bad, huh?
-Not bad.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.850
-I got more surprises, too.
-(laughs) Oh, great.

18:04.917 --> 18:08.654
<i>ROB:</i>
<i>We got a lot done on day one,</i>
<i>but today,</i>

18:08.720 --> 18:12.191
<i>we need to start by addressing</i>
<i>the plumbing and gas situatio.</i>

18:12.257 --> 18:14.593
-We got the gas line
right here.
-Beautiful.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.662
<i>ROB:</i>
<i>So I know</i>
<i>that swapping the kitchen sink</i>

18:16.728 --> 18:18.664
<i>and the stove doesn't seem lie</i>
<i>a big deal to Sabrina.</i>

18:18.730 --> 18:21.867
Reroute the, uh, drain
into the cast.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.502
<i>But in order to make it happen,</i>

18:23.569 --> 18:25.838
<i>we have to move all the pipes,</i>

18:25.904 --> 18:28.407
which means we have to open
the ceiling in the basement

18:28.474 --> 18:30.108
to get it done.

18:30.175 --> 18:31.109
<i>It took a little while</i>

18:31.176 --> 18:33.245
<i>to get everything figured out,</i>

18:33.312 --> 18:35.714
but my team and I got it done
in just a few hours.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.716
Good. Everything's up
to code now,

18:37.783 --> 18:39.718
and, uh, I appreciate it.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.386
Good going, my man.

18:41.453 --> 18:44.590
-Thank you, sir.
-All right.

18:44.656 --> 18:46.225
<i>SABRINA:</i>
<i>I'm really excited</i>
<i>about this modern</i>

18:46.291 --> 18:48.894
<i>farmhouse facelift,</i>
<i>but I want to make sure</i>

18:48.961 --> 18:50.562
that Heather likes all
of the materials,

18:50.629 --> 18:52.231
and nobody knows Heather
better than Debbie.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.233
So, what do you think
about the shaker style cabinets?

18:54.299 --> 18:56.401
-White?
-Yes. I mean,
that's cherry to cheery

18:56.468 --> 18:58.270
-right there,
and that's really cool.
-Good.

18:58.337 --> 19:01.173
Okay, so that's okay.
'Cause it's black matte,

19:01.240 --> 19:03.575
which is pretty on trend,
but it has that farmhouse vibe.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.878
Yeah, and are you picking this
up in, like, the light fixtures?

19:05.944 --> 19:07.579
-Absolutely.
You're like a little designer.
-(gasps)

19:07.646 --> 19:09.581
I mean, I'm learning so much
with you guys.

19:09.648 --> 19:10.749
I should hang out
with you more often.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.417
Okay, so,
this you need to choose.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.286
These are
the backsplash options.

19:14.353 --> 19:15.621
-Okay.
-So out of all these,

19:15.687 --> 19:17.923
-which one do you like the best?
-I feel like

19:17.990 --> 19:20.926
Heather likes a little texture,
a little dimension.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.928
-Okay.
-So I feel like
she'd really love that.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.297
Okay, good. This gives it a
little bit of depth and warmth.

19:25.364 --> 19:26.932
You like that vibe?

19:26.999 --> 19:28.901
-I love that. Yes.
-Okay, good.

19:28.967 --> 19:30.869
-That was easy.
-A little contrast
between that and that.

19:30.936 --> 19:33.639
-You're an easy client.
-I know my girl a little bit.

19:33.705 --> 19:35.207
-I know Heather a bit, so...
-Okay. Good.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.877
-(saw buzzing)
<i>-NISCHELLE: Everywhere you look,</i>

19:38.944 --> 19:41.413

So Debbie and I called
the current owners...

20:07.839 --> 20:09.474
Oh, my gosh.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.311
-Ready? One, two, three.

20:21.019 --> 20:22.554
So me
and my little sister Denise

20:22.621 --> 20:24.823
shared this room
for a long time.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.359
This was my room!

20:27.426 --> 20:29.828

"We love you, Debbie Gibson!"
right out that window,

23:47.526 --> 23:49.461
Thank you.

23:49.528 --> 23:52.097
(Debbie laughs)

23:52.164 --> 23:54.866
-You had me move for snack time?
-You didn't.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.134
-It's-it's a pantry.
-Can I have one, please?

23:56.201 --> 23:57.536
-Thank you.
-Yeah. Good luck.

23:57.602 --> 23:58.837
Get out of here.
Get out of here.

23:58.904 --> 24:00.572
-Come on! (laughs)
-Get out of here.

24:00.639 --> 24:02.707
-You got a lot of nerve, Rob.
-(Debbie laughs)

24:02.774 --> 24:04.709
<i>ROB:</i>
<i>Everybody's been working</i>

24:04.776 --> 24:06.545
<i>really hard on this renovation.</i>

24:06.611 --> 24:08.213
<i>We cleaned up the outside,</i>

24:08.280 --> 24:10.882
<i>and we definitely</i>
<i>brightened up the inside.</i>

24:10.949 --> 24:14.653
<i>Sabrina's design is looking</i>
<i>really great, and Debbie and I</i>

24:14.719 --> 24:17.722
are just finishing up the
backsplash that she picked out.

24:17.789 --> 24:21.092
DEBBIE:
I love that when I'm visiting,
I'm gonna be able

24:21.159 --> 24:23.829
to say, "I did this."

24:23.895 --> 24:26.798
Really, this whole project
is because of you.

24:26.865 --> 24:30.035
Oh, thank you. Well,
Heather deserves it. (laughs)

24:31.036 --> 24:33.705
<i>NISCHELLE:</i>
<i>As day nine comes to a close,</i>
<i>Debbie's hard work</i>

24:33.772 --> 24:35.574
<i>on the backsplash is done.</i>

24:35.640 --> 24:38.143
-(horn toots)
-(Nischelle laughs)

24:38.210 --> 24:39.878
So while Rob finishes up
some work in the kitchen...

24:39.945 --> 24:41.546
Now we eat.
<i>...Debbie's taking me</i>

24:41.613 --> 24:43.648
<i>to pick up some food</i>
<i>for the crew</i>

24:43.715 --> 24:44.816
<i>and the design team.</i>

24:44.883 --> 24:47.018
-You're driving.
-I'm in. I get it.

24:47.085 --> 24:48.954
-NISCHELLE: Ooh, pizza,
here we come! Yes!
-(laughs)

24:52.090 --> 24:54.092
<i>NISCHELLE:</i>
<i>In driving around</i>
<i>with Debbie through Merrick,</i>

24:54.159 --> 24:55.760
<i>it was clear</i>
<i>that her roots here were strog</i>

24:55.827 --> 24:57.762
<i>as she seemed to know everyone.</i>

24:57.829 --> 25:00.866
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
there's my friend Ron Luparello.

25:00.932 --> 25:02.534
-This guy?
-(toots horn)

25:02.601 --> 25:04.536
What?! How are you?

25:04.603 --> 25:05.804
<i>NISCHELLE:</i>
<i>It turns out that Ron was an old</i>

25:05.871 --> 25:06.972
<i>high school friend of Debbie's.</i>

25:07.038 --> 25:08.740
Prom pose!
<i>And even though</i>

25:08.807 --> 25:10.041
<i>he couldn't</i>
<i>join us on our journey...</i>

25:10.108 --> 25:12.611
There it is.
O.M.G., which stands for

25:12.677 --> 25:13.979
"Oh, my galleria."

25:14.045 --> 25:16.214
(laughter)

25:16.281 --> 25:19.217
So what Debbie didn't know is I
invited two of her old friends,

25:19.284 --> 25:21.553
Buddy and Iris,
to meet us at the pizza place

25:21.620 --> 25:23.021
just like old times.

25:23.088 --> 25:25.023
I walked in here,
and I was like, "Whoa."

25:25.090 --> 25:27.192
The smell hit me.
I needed all of it.

25:27.259 --> 25:29.561
Got to get the sauce right,
and I'm Italian,

25:29.628 --> 25:32.931
and my mom would be
making a sauce

25:32.998 --> 25:35.800
-on Sunday morning
that would get us out of bed.
-Uh-huh.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.836
-And she would simmer it
all morning.
-Yeah.

25:37.903 --> 25:40.705
-We would eat, like, like,
3:00, Italian meal.
-I mean...

25:40.772 --> 25:43.074
And what about Buddy and Iris?
Would they ever,

25:43.141 --> 25:44.676
-like, hang with you?
-Aah!

25:44.743 --> 25:47.178
-(laughter)
-Oh, my God.

25:47.245 --> 25:48.947
-Wait. Both of y'all are here.
-Hey.

25:49.014 --> 25:52.284
What's happening?
Oh, my gosh.

25:52.350 --> 25:55.053
<i>Iris and I met when we were 12</i>
<i>years old in junior high school,</i>

25:55.120 --> 25:58.623
<i>and are still amazing friends</i>
<i>to this day.</i>

25:58.690 --> 26:03.261
<i>Buddy was one of my very first</i>
<i>backup dancers,</i>

26:03.328 --> 26:06.097
<i>and he still dances with me</i>
<i>to this day</i>

26:06.164 --> 26:08.833
<i>and choreographs with me,</i>
<i>and we are besties.</i>

26:08.900 --> 26:10.902
<i>Wait. Can we</i>

26:10.969 --> 26:12.804
tell Nischelle
about our first gig together

26:12.871 --> 26:14.739
at Joey's Place
in Clifton, New Jersey?

26:14.806 --> 26:16.074
-Yes.
-Oh, my gosh, please do.

26:16.141 --> 26:17.909
We put lifts into the show

26:17.976 --> 26:19.277
-thinking we were
quite something.
-Mm-hmm.

26:19.344 --> 26:21.112
-We went through the...
-Had to put a lift...

26:21.179 --> 26:23.882
And so Joey's Place,
what we didn't realize was,

26:23.949 --> 26:26.318
the ceiling was a little lower
than we anticipated,

26:26.384 --> 26:27.986
and there was stucco on it.

26:28.053 --> 26:30.722
I lifted like this,
and she went through...

26:30.789 --> 26:32.657
-Her head went
through the ceiling.
-(laughter)

26:32.724 --> 26:35.193
-Oh, God.
-And so now,
you'd bring her down,

26:35.260 --> 26:37.295
-and there's stucco
raining on her.
-There's a stucco shower.

26:37.362 --> 26:39.331
-I mean...
-And the next day,

26:39.397 --> 26:41.666
-my friends called me and said,
"How'd it go?"
-No.

26:41.733 --> 26:44.336
-I said, "I'm gonna be fired."
-(laughter)

26:44.402 --> 26:45.170
-And I was, and I'm still here.
-In that moment,

26:45.236 --> 26:46.905
-what did you think?
-Here we are.

26:46.972 --> 26:49.607
Buddy's story had me
in stitches, and then Iris

26:49.674 --> 26:52.110
<i>whips out this photo book</i>
<i>that was really special.</i>

26:52.177 --> 26:54.946
-DEBBIE: Oh!
-Here we are very young.

26:55.013 --> 26:56.781
-DEBBIE: Oh, my gosh.
-Is this the three of you?

26:56.848 --> 26:58.249
-Look at you guys.
-I don't know this.
-IRIS: But wait.

26:58.316 --> 26:59.851
I do have pictures of... I think

26:59.918 --> 27:01.820
-Buddy's in some of these.
-BUDDY: Am I in?

27:01.886 --> 27:03.254
-DEBBIE: Oh, my gosh,
look at us!
-IRIS: Is this not funny?

27:03.321 --> 27:05.757
DEBBIE:
Oh, my God. Me try...

27:05.824 --> 27:07.225
Me making tomato sauce.
I was just telling you

27:07.292 --> 27:09.728
-about tomato sauce.
-That is so funny. You were.

27:09.794 --> 27:13.131
<i>NISCHELLE:</i>
<i>Spending time with her besties</i>
<i>was really fun,</i>

27:13.198 --> 27:15.133
<i>but now it's time to get</i>
<i>those pies back to the house</i>

27:15.200 --> 27:17.802
<i>so Debbie and the team</i>
<i>can get a good night's rest</i>

27:17.869 --> 27:20.038
<i>'cause they have another day</i>
<i>of hard work tomorrow.</i>

27:23.908 --> 27:26.077
You're actually
shockingly handy.

27:26.144 --> 27:29.014
-I am?
-I think so. Breaker on, Rob!

27:29.080 --> 27:31.816
-Yay!
-(whoops)

27:31.883 --> 27:33.084
<i>ROB:</i>
<i>If we drop this,</i>
<i>not only are we gonna</i>

<i>break the slab...</i>

27:34.486 --> 27:36.388
Halfway home, boys.
Halfway home.

27:36.454 --> 27:38.890
<i>...but we're gonna damage</i>
<i>the refinished floors.</i>

27:46.231 --> 27:47.365
<i>NISCHELLE:</i>
<i>Our two weeks on Long Island</i>

27:47.432 --> 27:48.933
<i>are coming to a close.</i>

27:49.000 --> 27:51.269
<i>Our team has installed</i>
<i>all the new appliances</i>

27:51.336 --> 27:54.105
<i>and brought back in Heather's</i>
<i>beautiful refrigerator.</i>

27:54.172 --> 27:57.175
<i>With only two days left</i>
<i>on this renovation,</i>

27:57.242 --> 28:00.178
<i>everyone is scrambling to get</i>
<i>the final pieces in place.</i>

28:01.813 --> 28:04.215
The countertops came in
without a hitch.

28:04.282 --> 28:05.817
Everything looks great.

28:05.884 --> 28:07.452
<i>We have a couple</i>
<i>of smaller pieces</i>

28:07.519 --> 28:10.088
<i>already laid down</i>
<i>and secured into place.</i>

28:10.155 --> 28:12.824
<i>But the countertop</i>
<i>on the entertaining island</i>

28:12.891 --> 28:14.692
is an absolute monster.

28:14.759 --> 28:16.294
How much does this thing weigh?

28:16.361 --> 28:18.296
Uh, 500?

28:18.363 --> 28:20.065
-500?
-Yeah.
-500.

28:21.032 --> 28:23.835
<i>ROB: This is a nine-foot,</i>
<i>custom-cut countertop.</i>

28:23.902 --> 28:25.703
Be careful.

28:25.770 --> 28:27.338
<i>It is definitely one</i>
<i>of the largest pieces</i>

28:27.405 --> 28:29.240
<i>I've ever installed.</i>

28:29.307 --> 28:32.177
<i>I have a lot of manpower here</i>
<i>to move it into place.</i>

28:32.243 --> 28:34.045
Watch your back.

28:34.112 --> 28:35.713
-Set it down.
<i>-It's a hard, slow process.</i>

28:35.780 --> 28:37.215
Rest.

28:37.282 --> 28:39.717
Halfway home, boys.

28:39.784 --> 28:43.021
<i>If we drop this, not only</i>
<i>are we gonna break the slab,</i>

28:43.088 --> 28:45.023

and we have no time
to finish before tomorrow.

28:48.359 --> 28:51.463
Oh! Looks good, boys!

28:55.867 --> 28:57.168
You're actually
shockingly handy.

28:57.235 --> 29:00.738
-I am?
-I think so.

29:00.805 --> 29:02.407
Sabrina really, really knows
how to take charge,

29:02.474 --> 29:04.409
and she has a vision.

29:04.476 --> 29:08.179
You know, like, we don't want to
rename my song "Electrocute"

29:08.246 --> 29:10.915
'cause that wouldn't be so cute.
So you're sure the...

29:10.982 --> 29:12.217
-breaker's off, right?
-I'm sure you can handle it.

29:12.283 --> 29:13.918
Yes, the breaker is off.

29:13.985 --> 29:14.953
<i>DEBBIE:</i>
<i>There's nothing she won't do.</i>

29:15.019 --> 29:16.387
She's really fearless

29:16.454 --> 29:17.956
when it comes
to this whole process.

29:18.022 --> 29:21.226
Take one wire, and we're gonna
wrap it around.

29:21.292 --> 29:22.927
-Okay. Okay.
-Like, marry them together.

29:22.994 --> 29:24.429
On there, and then
we're just gonna put it

29:24.496 --> 29:26.231
right back
into the junction box.

29:26.297 --> 29:28.366
-That's it? (gasps)
-Yeah.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.068
All right, let's put
the breaker on, Rob!

29:30.135 --> 29:33.271
-Yay!
-(whoops)

29:33.338 --> 29:35.140
Now you can say that you've
actually wired lighting before.

29:35.206 --> 29:37.876
-Yes, this is amazing!
-This looks great.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.245
Sabrina and I were,
like, all over

29:40.311 --> 29:42.780
<i>the lighting piece</i>
<i>of the puzzle.</i>

29:42.847 --> 29:44.415
-Pop this right in,
and you're okay?
-Oh, my God!

29:44.482 --> 29:46.784
-Then pop it in.
-So gratifying.

29:46.851 --> 29:47.886
-Get in there.
-Look at that.

29:47.952 --> 29:49.087
SABRINA:
Good. Done!

29:49.154 --> 29:50.355
(whoops)

29:53.291 --> 29:55.160
<i>ROB:</i>
<i>Lookit. We're on</i>
<i>the home stretch today.</i>

29:55.226 --> 29:58.229
<i>We got most of the big items</i>
<i>out of the way.</i>

29:58.296 --> 30:01.032
-You ever used
a nail gun before?
-No.

30:01.099 --> 30:02.400
So, today,
it's just punch list things.

30:02.467 --> 30:04.235
Here we go.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.004
-(click)
-You got it. Perfect.
-(Debbie whoops)

30:06.070 --> 30:07.505
One more right here.

30:07.572 --> 30:09.107
-Okay.
-Put it right here.

30:09.174 --> 30:11.109
-(click)
-Awesome!

30:11.176 --> 30:12.577
Easy. You're a pro.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.879
-Great job.
-Oh, my gosh. I mean...

30:15.847 --> 30:18.449
All right, be careful
with this thing, guys.

30:18.516 --> 30:20.585
This is the actual piano
that Debbie Gibson

30:20.652 --> 30:22.187
wrote her first song on.

30:22.253 --> 30:24.155
-Bring it down?
-Set it down.

30:24.222 --> 30:26.224
I don't want
to change the natural charm

30:26.291 --> 30:29.527
and character that this thing
has-- scratches and nooks

30:29.594 --> 30:33.031
and stuff. I just want to get
the dust off and clean it.

30:33.097 --> 30:35.500
Now we'll kind of bring it back
to life,

30:35.567 --> 30:38.203
and it'll be a centerpiece
in this room for sure.

30:38.269 --> 30:40.104
<i>The renovation is done,</i>
<i>and I got to be honest.</i>

30:40.171 --> 30:43.041
After seeing all
of Debbie's hard work

30:43.107 --> 30:45.043
<i>these last two weeks</i>
<i>and being part</i>

30:45.109 --> 30:47.178
<i>of cleaning up her piano</i>
<i>and getting it tuned up...</i>

30:47.245 --> 30:49.080
(playing notes)

30:49.147 --> 30:53.918
...I have officially become
a Debbie Gibson superfan.

30:53.985 --> 30:54.953
<i>I may even ask her</i>

30:55.019 --> 30:57.455
<i>to do a little performance</i>
<i>tomorrow night.</i>

30:58.957 --> 31:01.159
<i>SABRINA:</i>
<i>Is it heavy?</i>

31:01.226 --> 31:02.360
A little bit. It's okay.

31:02.427 --> 31:03.861
Yeah. More like this.

31:03.928 --> 31:05.163
-All right.
-Careful.

31:05.230 --> 31:06.531
This is the best part!

31:06.598 --> 31:08.433
She's almost here!

31:08.499 --> 31:10.301
It's right before the reveal,
and I get

31:10.368 --> 31:12.503
to put the finishing touches
in the space.

31:12.570 --> 31:14.205
-Wait, wait, wait!
-Ooh, secret compartment.

31:14.272 --> 31:15.240
The most important part.

31:15.306 --> 31:16.541
-Pillows?
-Pillows.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.543
<i>DEBBIE:</i>
<i>It's like the heavy lifting's</i>

31:18.610 --> 31:20.912
done, and now,
it's the aesthetics

31:20.979 --> 31:23.982
<i>and, like,</i>
<i>the little pops of color,</i>

31:24.048 --> 31:25.383
<i>and, you know,</i>
<i>the lemons and the flowers.</i>

31:25.450 --> 31:27.418
<i>It's going great,</i>

31:27.485 --> 31:30.154
and it really, really enhances
the look of the place.

31:30.221 --> 31:32.557
-Sabrina,
where do you want this?
-Here.

31:32.624 --> 31:35.093
-Okay. What else?
-Lots more.

31:35.159 --> 31:37.128
<i>DEBBIE:</i>
<i>So excited.</i>

31:37.195 --> 31:39.664
<i>I cannot believe how</i>
<i>this whole project turned out.</i>

31:39.731 --> 31:42.500
<i>SABRINA:</i>
<i>Debbie is excited,</i>
<i>which makes me feel</i>

31:42.567 --> 31:44.135
like Heather's gonna
absolutely love it,

31:44.202 --> 31:45.536
and that's all that matters.

31:45.603 --> 31:48.339
I think it's going
to make Heather so happy

31:48.406 --> 31:50.608
to have this painting
in the space

31:50.675 --> 31:52.377
because her friend
actually painted this for her.

31:52.443 --> 31:54.412
-There?
-No. Other way a little.

31:54.479 --> 31:56.114
-There?
-Little bit more.

31:56.180 --> 31:58.116
-There?
-That's good.

31:58.182 --> 31:59.417
All right, check this out.

31:59.484 --> 32:01.085
DEBBIE:
Oh, my gosh!

32:01.152 --> 32:03.254
<i>I'm blown away by the fact</i>

32:03.321 --> 32:05.957
that her best friend Terry's art

32:06.024 --> 32:09.127
<i>is disguising the fact</i>
<i>that the TV's a TV.</i>

32:09.193 --> 32:12.630
I spent so many years
entertaining my family

32:12.697 --> 32:15.133
<i>while they were eating,</i>
<i>while they were gathered.</i>

32:15.199 --> 32:18.303
<i>When I saw the piano</i>
<i>in the dining room, you know,</i>

32:18.369 --> 32:21.039
it really kind of brought
the whole thing full circle.

32:21.105 --> 32:23.174
We are almost there.

32:23.241 --> 32:24.976
<i>DEBBIE:</i>
<i>I've never done anything</i>
<i>like this before.</i>

32:25.043 --> 32:27.345
No, you can't eat
the decorations!

32:27.412 --> 32:30.448
Mmm! All this hard work
has made me hungry!

32:30.515 --> 32:32.450

Oh, my goodness.

32:32.517 --> 32:35.553
<i>DEBBIE:</i>
<i>So to see the transformation</i>
<i>is incredible.</i>

32:35.620 --> 32:37.689
We're definitely gonna be doing
some celebrating.

They are gonna be here
very soon.

32:39.691 --> 32:41.492
-Oh, my goodness!
-So we got to hurry up.

I'd be a little nervous,
very excited.

33:00.511 --> 33:02.547
-Here we go.
-Deep breath.

33:02.613 --> 33:04.482

-Rob, a hug. Hi. Can we go?
-Yeah.

-Yes.

-Great. We'll see you soon.
-See you all in a bit.

<i>DEBBIE:</i>
<i>I feel like</i>

34:21.793 --> 34:24.529
we captured
her aspirational vision

34:24.595 --> 34:26.531
of her home.

34:26.597 --> 34:28.332
HEATHER:
Where...?

34:28.399 --> 34:29.600
-Where do we start?!
-(Debbie laughs)

34:29.667 --> 34:31.502
-Well, let's start right here.
-Okay.

34:31.569 --> 34:33.571
I mean, you have this beautiful
new sitting room.

34:33.638 --> 34:36.707
And I know that you did not want
a television

34:36.774 --> 34:37.708
right when you walked in.

34:37.775 --> 34:41.179
-HEATHER: That is true.
-But this is a frame TV.

34:41.245 --> 34:43.181
That's Terry's orchid painting.

34:43.247 --> 34:45.516
-Yes! Her bestie's painting.
-Wow.
-That's gorgeous.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.385
So it's a television.

34:47.452 --> 34:49.587
-You can put the art
in it when it's not on.
-Oh, my God.

34:49.654 --> 34:51.255
-NISCHELLE: So it looks...
-COLTON: That's amazing.

34:51.322 --> 34:53.191
-HEATHER: I love that.
-NISCHELLE: Isn't it great?

34:53.257 --> 34:55.293
-And these floors
are your floors.
-HEATHER: They are?

34:55.359 --> 34:56.794
<i>-Amazing.</i>
<i>-COLTON: Beautiful.</i>
<i>-They sanded them down.</i>

34:56.861 --> 34:59.130
<i>They really made them pop.</i>

34:59.197 --> 35:00.364
<i>-HEATHER: They're gorgeous.</i>
<i>-They're gorgeous, right?</i>

35:00.431 --> 35:03.167
-So much to take in. Oh, my God.
-(laughter)

35:03.234 --> 35:05.269
You ready to go see that
cherry to cheery kitchen?

35:05.336 --> 35:07.438
<i>-I am. Let's do it!</i>
<i>-All right. This is good.</i>

-Hey!

35:11.509 --> 35:14.312
Home run!

35:14.378 --> 35:15.179
-HEATHER: Yeah.
-NISCHELLE: The first thing

35:15.246 --> 35:17.114
Sabrina and Rob
said when they walked

35:17.181 --> 35:18.883
in here, and Debbie, too--

35:18.950 --> 35:20.551
"Take it all down!

35:20.618 --> 35:22.753
We're opening this bad boy up."

35:22.820 --> 35:24.322
<i>Because you said</i>

35:24.388 --> 35:26.324
<i>-you wanted a gathering place.</i>
<i>-HEATHER: Yeah.</i>

35:26.390 --> 35:28.493
<i>NISCHELLE: So that's what</i>
<i>they wanted to give you.</i>

35:28.559 --> 35:30.194
<i>-HEATHER: This is...</i>
<i>-They wanted</i>
<i>to give you this space</i>

35:30.261 --> 35:31.629
that's gonna make you the
happiest when you're in here.

35:31.696 --> 35:33.130
-It really does.
-Yeah.

35:33.197 --> 35:34.632
I mean, it is... it is cheery.

35:34.699 --> 35:36.167
-Isn't it?
-And it's light, baby.

35:36.234 --> 35:37.869
-And it is...
-It's light, baby.

35:37.935 --> 35:39.804
This is my jimmy-jam.

35:39.871 --> 35:42.540
-I'm like...
-It's her jimmy-jam!
-(laughter)

35:42.607 --> 35:45.176
I can dig it.
And you have so much storage.

35:45.243 --> 35:48.212
<i>-So you had that table there</i>
<i>before.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

35:48.279 --> 35:50.381
<i>And so, because we extended</i>
<i>and made this island so big</i>

35:50.448 --> 35:52.250
<i>that people can gather at,</i>

35:52.316 --> 35:53.851
<i>they also wanted</i>
<i>to put all your storage here.</i>

35:53.918 --> 35:55.353
<i>Because we took those cabinets</i>
<i>out here...</i>

35:55.419 --> 35:56.687
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-...they wanted to make sure</i>

35:56.754 --> 35:58.589
<i>you have a place for everything.</i>

35:58.656 --> 36:00.825
Moved your stove here.

36:00.892 --> 36:03.394
<i>-Hello.</i>
<i>-HEATHER: What?!</i>

36:03.461 --> 36:05.796
<i>Like, come on now.</i>

36:05.863 --> 36:08.599
-Yeah.
-This is just ridonculous.

36:08.666 --> 36:09.901
<i>DEBBIE:</i>
<i>I feel like</i>

36:09.967 --> 36:12.837
one of the biggest changes
for Heather

36:12.904 --> 36:15.840
in the kitchen is the fact
that the stove

36:15.907 --> 36:18.209
<i>and the sink are flip-flopped.</i>
<i>(laughs)</i>

36:18.276 --> 36:20.811
<i>Like, I think that was, like,</i>

36:20.878 --> 36:23.714
the biggest surprise maybe
for her,

36:23.781 --> 36:26.717
um, in terms of the layout.

36:26.784 --> 36:29.554
-You really have two
gathering spaces now.
-Yeah.

36:29.620 --> 36:31.722
<i>NISCHELLE: I mean, you've got</i>
<i>everyone being able to gather</i>

36:31.789 --> 36:34.292
<i>around the island, but then</i>
<i>you've got this really beautiful</i>

36:34.358 --> 36:36.460
<i>table--</i>
<i>custom table, by the way.</i>

36:36.527 --> 36:38.396
<i>-(Debbie gasps)</i>
<i>-HEATHER: Oh, wow.</i>
<i>-And because,</i>

36:38.462 --> 36:40.865
like, the thing that brought you
all together was music...

36:40.932 --> 36:42.400
-Yes.
-...we had to keep the piano
in here of course.

36:42.466 --> 36:43.868
HEATHER:
Of course you had
to keep the piano.

36:43.935 --> 36:45.269
-We had to keep it.
-COLTON: Yeah.

36:45.336 --> 36:46.771
HEATHER:
Fits perfectly in here.

36:46.837 --> 36:47.471
-DEBBIE: Right. Well, okay.
-COLTON: It does.

36:47.538 --> 36:49.440
It really works in this room.

36:49.507 --> 36:50.575
DEBBIE: You know I like
to do a little, you know,

36:50.641 --> 36:51.943
-dinner theatre.
-(laughter)

36:52.009 --> 36:55.246

for everybody.

37:51.602 --> 37:55.740
The party can't be over without
something really special.

<i>It was Debbie's mother,</i>
<i>Miss Diane, who found Heather,</i>

<i>brought her into the fold,</i>
<i>sent her off</i>

<i>they documented</i>
<i>their whole relationship.</i>

mine and Heather first trip

-Hi, Diane.
-Hi, Di.

<i>HEATHER:</i>
<i>The entire purpose</i>
<i>of doing the video back then</i>

39:01.639 --> 39:03.607
was to say "Hi" to Diane,

39:03.674 --> 39:06.010
<i>to take her on the trip with us</i>
<i>'cause she couldn't come.</i>

39:06.077 --> 39:07.678

Hi, Diane.

She'll love that.

39:21.425 --> 39:22.793
(sniffles)

39:22.860 --> 39:24.995
And, um...

39:25.062 --> 39:28.799
it just shows how much
my mom's always been with me.

39:28.866 --> 39:30.768
Let's talk about you and Mommy.

39:30.835 --> 39:32.970
-Is she here?
-She is here.

39:33.037 --> 39:34.638
-She's your manager, right?
-Yeah, she is.

<i>And even when</i>

that my mom, Diane,
passed to her--

<i>When Debbie's career</i>
<i>first took off,</i>

40:10.474 --> 40:13.410
<i>her mother, Diane, who passed</i>
<i>away earlier this year,</i>

40:13.477 --> 40:15.880
<i>travelled everywhere she went</i>
<i>to take care of her.</i>

40:15.946 --> 40:18.849
<i>She needed to find someone</i>
<i>to pass the torch to.</i>

40:18.916 --> 40:21.018
<i>And only a month</i>
<i>after she first met Heather,</i>

40:21.085 --> 40:23.888
<i>she knew she was the one.</i>

40:23.954 --> 40:25.523
<i>LINDA:</i>
<i>When my sister chose Heather</i>

40:25.589 --> 40:28.192
<i>to, uh, pass the torch to,</i>
<i>that gave her</i>

40:28.259 --> 40:31.162
great comfort
to know that Deborah was going

40:31.228 --> 40:34.431
in the right direction
in Heather's hands.

40:34.498 --> 40:37.902
<i>HEATHER:</i>
<i>She taught me everything</i>
<i>that she knew,</i>

40:37.968 --> 40:39.904
and she was really,
really special to me.

40:39.970 --> 40:42.807
So to honor her in this way,

40:42.873 --> 40:46.510
<i>um, made it feel like</i>
<i>she was here and a part of it.</i>

40:46.577 --> 40:48.612
So, um...

40:52.783 --> 40:54.618
(choked up):
I need a minute.

40:55.786 --> 40:57.755
To friends, family

40:57.822 --> 40:59.757
and the woman who made all
of this blending possible,

40:59.824 --> 41:01.559
Miss Diane. Yes?

41:01.625 --> 41:02.960
-Yes.
-To Diane.
-To Diane.

41:03.027 --> 41:04.595
-Cheers to Diane.
-Mama Diane,

41:04.662 --> 41:06.197
-the queen of all pioneers.
-Cheers.

41:06.263 --> 41:07.565
-Yes, indeed.
-Cheers.

41:07.631 --> 41:09.200
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

41:09.266 --> 41:11.502
My favorite moment
of the day was

41:11.569 --> 41:12.903
<i>when we walked in,</i>
<i>and Debbie got to sit down</i>

41:12.970 --> 41:15.773
<i>at her childhood piano.</i>

41:15.840 --> 41:19.109
I remember coming home
from school

41:19.176 --> 41:23.914
and writing this song
on this piano.

41:23.981 --> 41:25.983
-NISCHELLE: You... Really?
-Yes!

41:26.050 --> 41:27.751
NISCHELLE:
Oh, honey, I... Let me...

41:27.818 --> 41:29.086
let me get ready to go
to the ninth-grade dance.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.589
-Come on.
