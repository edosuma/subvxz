Alright.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.647

00:14.648 --> 00:16.517
Yes, sir.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.052
Ah. Thank you.

00:18.052 --> 00:21.155
Oh, uh, and I have
a small knife around my neck.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.424
You have a knife
around your neck?

00:23.424 --> 00:26.560
In case I can't reach

the question?

02:22.810 --> 02:25.479
You're not worried
about the deposition, are you?

02:25.479 --> 02:28.148
The defense are just
throwing stuff against the wall.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.850
Yeah. Well, the more
that they throw,

02:29.850 --> 02:31.185
the more likely
something will stick.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.820
And if something sticks,
Elijah could walk.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.288
That won't happen.

02:34.288 --> 02:37.725
They can depose me, Grey, half

it won't change
who Elijah Stone is.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.695
I just wish I knew more
about the strategy.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.831
I don't even know
who his defense attorney is.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.666
And the DA's office
has a firewall

02:45.666 --> 02:47.968
between me and anything
relating to Elijah Stone.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.204
The RICO case against
Elijah is solid.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.305
They're just desperate.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.006
That's what worries me.

02:53.006 --> 02:56.544
RICO means anyone involved in
the organization is on the hook.

02:56.544 --> 02:57.778
I was a part
of the organization.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.349
Under duress.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.484
And his lawyers can't argue
that you were a mob lawyer

03:03.484 --> 03:05.586
without admitting
that their client is a mobster.

03:07.255 --> 03:09.357
You're right.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.625
Of course,
because you're always right.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.062
I'm going.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.566
Love you.

03:18.566 --> 03:19.833
I love you, too.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.771
Take my advice--
you want to put a tennis racket

03:23.771 --> 03:25.105
in her hand tomorrow.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.275
Oh, I was hoping we had
a swimmer on our hands.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.710
Whatever gets her
a full ride.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.412
Trust me. You don't want to know
what we're paying

03:31.412 --> 03:32.413
for Dominique's tuition.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.181
What happened?
Leah okay?

03:34.181 --> 03:36.049
Leah's fine. Hey.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.952
We had a minor accident
with the breast milk

03:38.952 --> 03:40.688
you left in the fridge.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.357
Oh, you mean the breast milk
that I woke up at 5:00 a.m.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.025
this morning to pump?
That breast milk?

03:45.025 --> 03:46.460
Yes.
Mm-kay.

03:46.460 --> 03:49.129
Mama is gon' feed

03:51.098 --> 03:54.402
Daddy-- Daddy's gonna wait
in the hot car.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.804
One more thing.
Uh, and I want to preface this

03:56.804 --> 03:58.939
by saying
I'm just the messenger.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.107
What is it?

04:00.107 --> 04:02.276
Lila's best friend, Jenny,

04:02.276 --> 04:03.811
canceled trick or treating
tomorrow night.

04:03.811 --> 04:04.878
Why? What happened?

04:04.878 --> 04:06.246
Her mom didn't say,

04:06.246 --> 04:08.282
but she left an awkward message, though.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.250
Okay. You have a theory.
What is it?

04:10.250 --> 04:13.921
They may not be comfortable
with the whole law-enforcement,

04:13.921 --> 04:15.789
gun-in-the-house thing.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.791
You know, um,
just a wild guess.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.494
You-- You are
on one today.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.397
The hours
take some getting used to.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.999
Mm-hmm. My REM cycle's
all over the place.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.901
I wasn't like this
at the academy.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.404
Yeah, I had something similar
when I first started.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.172
I know it's hard, but you got
to make sleep a priority.

04:32.172 --> 04:33.507
Man, I'm, like,
wide awake

04:33.507 --> 04:35.443
by the time my head
hits the pillow.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.144
When Henry was a baby,
we tried everything

04:37.144 --> 04:38.912
to get him to sleep--
soothing music,

04:38.912 --> 04:41.248
so many road trips
I'm sure we single-handedly

04:41.248 --> 04:42.683
destroyed
the environment,

04:42.683 --> 04:45.085
and a swaddling technique
I can still do in my sleep.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.921
Hmm, I don't think any of this
applies to me.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.190
Didn't a doctor just pull
a bullet out of you?

04:50.190 --> 04:51.425
Like, shouldn't you
be resting?

04:51.425 --> 04:54.294
It was an old bullet.
I'm fine.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.697
What?

04:56.697 --> 04:58.198
I overheard you talking
to Ashley

04:58.198 --> 05:01.101
about picking up some
of your things from her place.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.670
So look, if you want to talk
about it, we can t--

05:07.174 --> 05:09.343
Hello. Good morning.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.679
Chen. Sanford.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.384
What's up with him?

05:16.384 --> 05:18.719
He's just grumpy with everything
he's got going on.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.854
Wait.
What-- What's going on?

05:20.854 --> 05:21.889
Nothing.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.224
What?
He's fine. I'm fine.

05:24.224 --> 05:25.325
We're just eager to protect
and serve.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.294
Aaron.
I have to go. I'm so sorry.

05:27.294 --> 05:28.962
What?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.800
I, uh--
I found this checklist online.

05:32.800 --> 05:37.070
No screens, thermostat at 68,
meditation, lavender oil.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.071
No luck.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.207
Red light. Red light.
Red light!

No. I'm good. I'm good.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.893
No. Not good enough.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.195
When you are sleep deprived,
both your judgment

06:02.195 --> 06:03.997
and your reflexes
are impaired.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.866
It's no better
than being intoxicated.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.000
Do you understand?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.036
Yes, sir.
We switch.

06:10.337 --> 06:11.739
What's the problem?

06:11.739 --> 06:15.008
Oh. Our alert system
flagged several bills

06:15.008 --> 06:16.844
this young woman attempted
to deposit.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.345
Counterfeit?

06:18.345 --> 06:19.747
No, looks like they're
connected to some kind

06:19.747 --> 06:22.015
of law enforcement investigation.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.117
Hi. I-I'm just trying
to make a deposit.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.119
What's going on?
Uh, may I get your name?

06:26.119 --> 06:27.187
Macy Tomkins.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.188
And do you have any ID?

06:31.124 --> 06:33.226
And where did you get the bills
you were trying to deposit?

06:33.226 --> 06:35.295
I had a garage sale
over the weekend.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.698
Made $1,000
on a designer handbag.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.467
Should've gotten more,
if you want to know the truth.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.268
I don't suppose you got a name
or description

06:41.268 --> 06:42.436

06:42.436 --> 06:45.105
Mm, Brentwood housewife.
Yoga pants.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.707
Right. Any cameras around
where you live?

06:46.707 --> 06:48.141
No.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.142
Okay.
I'm just gonna have to get

06:49.142 --> 06:50.410
a little more information
from you.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.479
Celina, will you start

06:52.746 --> 06:54.648

07:05.526 --> 07:06.660
What are you doing here?

07:06.660 --> 07:08.829
Nobody told you?

07:08.829 --> 07:10.564
Told me what?

07:10.564 --> 07:12.533
I'm here for the deposition.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.536
Elijah Stone is my client.

07:17.204 --> 07:21.174
Um... that is a mistake.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.944
You do not want to be
in his orbit.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.146
I'm billing him
$800 an hour.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.481
It's a nice orbit.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.349
You read all the discovery.
You know what he did to me.

07:29.349 --> 07:30.651
I know what you allege
he did to you.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.154
Sorry to keep you waiting.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.923
Uh, the court reporter
is still setting up inside,

07:35.923 --> 07:37.825
but I could take you back,
if you'd like.

07:37.825 --> 07:40.093
Great. I just need
to make a quick call

07:40.093 --> 07:41.161
before we get started.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.162
Yeah. Sure.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.532
Excuse me.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.770
You know Elijah's attorney?

07:49.770 --> 07:51.038
We went to
law school together.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.940
Really?
Mm-hmm.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.307
Is there anything in her bag of
tricks we should look out for?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.309
She's smart, fairly ruthless,

07:56.309 --> 07:58.979
and God forbid you leave
the toilet seat up.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.480
We used to be engaged.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.515
Maybe you should've led
with that.

08:01.515 --> 08:02.883
Mm-hmm.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.053
We're not talking
about it.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.487
Look, I'm just saying
if you want to talk

08:07.487 --> 08:08.822
about the breakup,
I'm here.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.824
I don't.
Look, tomorrow's Halloween.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.325
The crazies are gonna be out
in full force,

08:12.325 --> 08:14.562
so let's just focus
on our job. Alright?

08:14.562 --> 08:15.428
Alright.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.065
Werewolf.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.066
What?

08:19.066 --> 08:20.568
Werewolf.

08:20.568 --> 08:21.669
She looks like she needs a hand.
We should stop.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.645
Morning.
Looks like you need some help.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.513
I have to get this prop to set
or I'm screwed.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.248
Okay. Well, uh, we'll get
your friend here loaded up,

08:35.248 --> 08:36.750
and you'll be
on your way in no time.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.351
Thank you.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.520
So, what are you,
like, a P.A. or...

08:40.520 --> 08:42.389
I'm a director.
I'm shooting a short film,

08:42.389 --> 08:45.225
but I lose my location
in an hour.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.027
That is so cool.
You hear what she said?

08:47.027 --> 08:48.028
Hmm.
She's a director.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.496
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

08:49.496 --> 08:51.531
Help her get to set.
She's losing daylight.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.766
Right.

08:57.571 --> 08:58.706
You know what?
I just need a better--

08:58.706 --> 09:00.173
I need a better angle.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.374
7-Adam-100.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.511
Show us Code 6
at Bronson and Rosewood--

09:04.511 --> 09:06.446
stalled vehicle blocking traffic.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.717
Hang on.
Wait, wait. Hold on.

09:09.717 --> 09:10.718
You shouldn't be lifting anything.

09:10.718 --> 09:11.952
I mean, you just had
major surgery.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.721
You did?
I can handle this.

09:13.721 --> 09:16.924
No, I didn't have <i>major</i> surgery.
I-I'm fine.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.025
Lift on three. Okay.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.260
Alright. One, two, three. Yeah.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.261
Lift.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.229
Yeah.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.230
Let's go! Push!
I'm pushing!

09:23.230 --> 09:24.231
Do you want me
to call someone?

09:24.231 --> 09:25.599
No!

09:25.599 --> 09:26.700
I had back surgery,
remember?
Oh! My leg. My leg.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.701
Oh! My knee. My knee.
My knee. My knee.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.136
You good?

09:29.136 --> 09:31.772
Yeah.
Thank you. Both of you.

09:31.772 --> 09:32.773
Yeah. Happy to help.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.944
Yeah. Bradford.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.712
No.
I assigned Siega to that.

09:38.712 --> 09:43.617
So, uh, what's your short about?
Like, werewolves versus zombies?

09:43.617 --> 09:45.452
The lycanthrope is a metaphor

09:45.452 --> 09:47.755
for the patriarchy's assault
on bodily autonomy.

09:47.755 --> 09:50.023
Wow.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.492
No, I never got it.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.396
So, uh, you know,
maybe I can, uh,

09:56.396 --> 09:58.431
take you out for coffee
and you can tell me more?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.668
No, thanks.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.604
No. No. Don't do anything.
I'll be right there.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.939
Let's go.

10:09.009 --> 10:12.680
<i>7-Adam-15. Possible
arson at Elm and West Sixth.</i>

10:15.448 --> 10:17.317
Just the firefighter
I wanted to see!

10:18.418 --> 10:21.121
I was thinking--
Since we are tied,

10:21.121 --> 10:22.455
how about tonight,
we have a little

10:22.455 --> 10:24.324
Lego-building
competition?

10:24.324 --> 10:25.859
You were a contractor.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.460
I didn't build houses
out of Lego.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.462
I think we should do
something intellectual,

10:29.462 --> 10:30.864
like learn a new language

10:30.864 --> 10:32.833
and see who's more fluent
at the end of the month.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.434
Oh.
Japanese?

10:34.434 --> 10:36.336
You taught English
in Kyoto.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.138
I was hoping
you wouldn't remember.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.306
I remember everything
you tell me.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.874
Uh-huh. What did I ask you
to pick up

10:40.874 --> 10:41.875
from the store after work?

10:41.875 --> 10:43.777
Milk. Eggs. Bread?

10:43.777 --> 10:44.778
Pops--
Popsicles.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.847
Guys?
See?
I remember everything.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.550
Looks like somebody
had money to burn.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.354
I'm very tired.

10:58.525 --> 11:00.127
Maybe the money was cursed.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.294
You know,
fire is very cleansing.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.230
It's used in all sorts
of rituals.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.998
Or it could be
something else.

11:04.998 --> 11:08.902
Or someone was trying to hide
evidence of an old crime.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.370
Tracking device.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.471
Why old crime?

11:11.471 --> 11:12.740
Well,
tracking devices nowadays

11:12.740 --> 11:14.708
are all microchips
and GPS.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.877
This thing's got to be
at least 10 years old.

11:16.877 --> 11:20.513
I'm guessing... federal.
Maybe DEA or FBI.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.682
So the money was part
of a law-enforcement sting?

11:22.682 --> 11:23.717
That seems likely.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.719
But why burn it now?

11:25.719 --> 11:28.021
We figure that out by finding
out whose tracker this is.

11:29.757 --> 11:30.858
Drive safe. Hey.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.559
Uh, I'm not sure
who to talk to.

11:32.559 --> 11:33.927
Yeah.
What's the problem?

11:33.927 --> 11:35.362
Um, these cops stopped
to help me,

11:35.362 --> 11:37.164
and one of them
left his radio behind.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.733
Yeah. I can take that.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.601
Did you happen
to catch their name?

11:41.601 --> 11:43.270
One of them looked exactly
like that guy

11:43.270 --> 11:44.738
from that murder documentary,

11:44.738 --> 11:46.840
but I think the radio
belonged to the broody one. Oh.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.275
The broody--

11:48.275 --> 11:51.845
Tim forgot his radio?
Tim Bradford, super cop?

11:51.845 --> 11:54.681
You know, this guy will not
let me forget that I was once

11:54.681 --> 11:56.016
three and a half minutes
late to roll call.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.217
Can you believe that?

11:57.217 --> 11:58.518
I...guess.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.120
This feels like Christmas.
Thank you.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.721
Cool. So you'll get it
back to him?

12:01.721 --> 12:04.057
Yeah, I got it.
You have a nice day.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.133
How did you become involved
in the sting operation

12:13.133 --> 12:15.202
against Elijah Stone?

12:15.202 --> 12:17.470
I raised my concerns
about his criminal enterprise

12:17.470 --> 12:18.872
to the LAPD.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.474
Paint me a picture.
You went to the front desk

12:21.474 --> 12:23.376
at Mid-Wilshire.
And then what?

12:23.376 --> 12:25.478
Well, I didn't go
through the front desk.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.547
Oh. I guess I'm confused.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.616
In your own words,
describe the first time

12:29.616 --> 12:32.820
you brought up Mr. Stone's
alleged crimes to the LAPD.

12:32.820 --> 12:35.422
I raised my concerns
with Detective Angela Lopez.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.790
At her desk?

12:36.790 --> 12:38.158
In our living room.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.160
They're married.
But you know that already.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.662
Oh. That's right. Mm.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.164
It's in my notes.

12:44.164 --> 12:47.167
Um, and this sting operation
was allowed to proceed

12:47.167 --> 12:50.637
despite an obvious and egregious
conflict of interest?

12:50.637 --> 12:52.973
Well, we had a mutual interest
in the truth.

12:52.973 --> 12:56.676
Is it common for detectives to
work cases involving relatives?

12:56.676 --> 12:59.579
No.
And why is that?

12:59.579 --> 13:02.950
I think there's a concern
that the detectives won't view

13:02.950 --> 13:04.684
the evidence objectively,

13:04.684 --> 13:05.819
but I don't think
that's an issue here. Interesting.

13:05.819 --> 13:06.786
Next question--
Uh, can I finish--

13:06.786 --> 13:07.787
Moving on.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.322
Let's just move on.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.092
I'm telling you,
it's not in the shop.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.027
Well, it didn't just
jump off my hip.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.695
Let me check
this bag again.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.468
The werewolf.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.703
I put down my radio
to help you lift that dumb prop.

13:23.703 --> 13:24.804
The director must have it.

13:24.804 --> 13:25.672
Did you get her number?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.676
Almost.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.949
What the hell?

13:35.949 --> 13:36.950
What is it?

13:40.153 --> 13:41.288
Who sent that?

13:41.288 --> 13:43.223
Someone who's about to get
in a lot of trouble.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.657
You know, uh,
you could just file

13:44.657 --> 13:47.360
an incident report
and get a new radio, right?

13:47.360 --> 13:48.661
And get written up?
That's one day's suspension

13:48.661 --> 13:49.696
without pay.

13:51.398 --> 13:54.334
I think I know where this is.
Let's go.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.304
Bailing on Halloween
is so passive-aggressive.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.172
I mean, if you have a problem
with me being a cop

13:59.172 --> 14:01.474
or having a gun at my house,
then just tell me.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.410
Agreed.
But if that's the issue,

14:03.410 --> 14:05.345
have James invite them over
for dinner tonight.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.081
Show them your gun safe.
Everyone loves James.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.816
People love me, too.

14:09.816 --> 14:12.986
For sure.
I, for example, adore you.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.854
Most people
find you terrifying.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.056
Right back at you.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.925
I know.
It's why we're so good together.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.659
Alright. Fine.

14:19.659 --> 14:22.095
I will have James invite them
to dinner.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.697
Uh, hi. Nyla Harper.
We spoke on the phone.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.333
This is Angela Lopez.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.568
Xavier. Thanks for diving
right in on this.

14:28.568 --> 14:29.836
Of course.

14:29.836 --> 14:31.171
I can't believe we haven't
worked together before--

14:31.171 --> 14:34.441
all the LAPD/DEA task forces
you were on.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.543
Yeah. I never worked anything
that took me to the Midwest.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.246
Smart. Undercover gets a whole
lot more uncomfortable

14:39.246 --> 14:40.880
when it's negative 20 out.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.050
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.
You wanted to see us?

14:43.050 --> 14:45.752
Uh, yes. Officers Nolan
and Juarez.

14:45.752 --> 14:48.855
They found the burned cash
and your old tracker.

14:48.855 --> 14:52.059
Thank you. You don't know what
it means to finally have a lead.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.594
We're happy to help.
A lead on what, exactly?

14:54.594 --> 14:57.297
Ten years ago, my partner,
Robert Buckley, set up a buy

14:57.297 --> 15:00.367
with a mid-level trafficker
named Winslow Harris.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.969
Rob had been deep undercover
for months,

15:01.969 --> 15:03.436
and this was a big break--

15:03.436 --> 15:05.973
a chance to get real intel
on Harris' operation.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.907
It sounds like it
didn't go as planned.

15:07.907 --> 15:11.144
To this day...
I'm not sure what happened.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.714
We found Rob's body
a week later.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.216
The tracker failed,
the money disappeared,

15:16.216 --> 15:18.151
and no one's heard
from Harris since.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.752
Huh.
The money is cursed.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.721
I'm sorry. What?
It's nothing.

15:21.721 --> 15:24.157
Fast-forward to today,
when money from the old sting

15:24.157 --> 15:26.293
set off alarms
at a local bank.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.794
Okay. Wait.
The dumpster fire

15:27.794 --> 15:29.129
and garage-sale chick
are connected?

15:29.129 --> 15:31.498
Macy Tomkins.
I ran info on her--

15:31.498 --> 15:34.501
spotty employment history,
a few overdue parking tickets.

15:34.501 --> 15:35.935
No criminal record.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.271
It can't be a coincidence
that the bills were flagged

15:38.271 --> 15:39.839
at the bank and the rest of them
were burned an hour later.

15:39.839 --> 15:42.642
It seems clear Macy was lying
about where she got the money.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.811
Question is,
how does she connect to Winslow?

15:44.811 --> 15:46.346
Let's go ask her.

15:46.346 --> 15:49.349
Man, this is one sketchy-ass
looking coffee truck.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.118
This is where I get my coffee
every morning.

15:51.118 --> 15:54.154
No Oat Milk Mafia hipsters
rewriting screenplays.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.356
Buck for coffee
and you go to work.

15:56.356 --> 15:59.359
You sound like
the old dude from "Up."

15:59.359 --> 16:00.927
Hey, Johnnie. Hi.

16:00.927 --> 16:03.463
Anyone drop off this radio?

16:03.463 --> 16:06.033
Nope. No.
Alright. Thank you.

16:08.335 --> 16:09.336
Damn it.

16:09.336 --> 16:10.637
They're running us
all over town.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.207
Okay. So, like,
what's the point?

16:14.207 --> 16:15.675
I mean, they haven't asked
for money or anything,

16:15.675 --> 16:17.177
and if they really wanted
to screw with the police,

16:17.177 --> 16:18.711
they could do a whole lot more
with that radio.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.013
I don't know.
We got to figure out

16:20.013 --> 16:21.481
which studio lot that is.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.317
Must have been hard,
all those years

16:24.317 --> 16:26.519
not knowing what happened
to your partner.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.221
Yeah.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.557
He wasn't just your partner.
You loved him.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.192
What?
Celina.

16:32.192 --> 16:35.228
I'm sorry if I overstepped.
You're just so sad.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.830
We met in intelligence.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.566
Once he finished
undercover school,

16:39.566 --> 16:42.569
we both ended up
in organized crime.

16:42.569 --> 16:46.173
After-work beers
turned into dinners...

16:46.173 --> 16:49.842
turned into... more.

16:49.842 --> 16:50.977
No one we worked with knew.

16:50.977 --> 16:53.046
It was a different time.

16:53.046 --> 16:56.316
But... we had each other.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.850
That was enough.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.120
Then he was gone.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.536
Seems a little upscale
for Macy's income bracket.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.771
Seriously. I can't even afford
to park here.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.741
Ms. Tomkins?
It's Officer Nolan.

17:21.741 --> 17:22.975
We met at the bank earlier.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.346
Security says she hasn't
left the building.

17:27.614 --> 17:28.548
Door's open.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.351
Police! We're coming in!

17:40.059 --> 17:41.528
She's dead.

17:43.130 --> 17:45.298
And we're sure
the money's not cursed?

17:53.573 --> 17:55.242
I scrubbed through
the lobby security footage,

17:55.242 --> 17:57.277
and this guy stood out.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.579
Came in about two hours ago,
stayed for 20 minutes,

17:59.579 --> 18:00.813
and then left in a hurry.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.915
Not much to go on.
Does it feel like Winslow?

18:02.915 --> 18:05.885
I don't know. Could be.
I can't see his face.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.720
St. Brendan medal.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.257
Patron saint of sailors.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.325
Winslow smuggled drugs
up the coast.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.926
Spent half his life
on a boat.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.099
He wore a necklace
just like this 10 years ago.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.101
Clasp is broken.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.136
She probably ripped it off

18:23.136 --> 18:24.304
as she was fighting
for her life.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.605
We'll get that checked
for DNA.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.340
It's gonna come back to Harris.
I know it.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.741
Okay. Let's say it does.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.510
What's his relationship
with Macy?

18:30.510 --> 18:32.845
If she lied to us in the bank
about where she got the money,

18:32.845 --> 18:35.515
then it's safe to assume
she was covering for him.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.116
Or she stole it from him.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.851
Either way, when he found out
the money was flagged,

18:38.851 --> 18:40.287
he panicked
and burned the rest.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.688
Then came here
and killed her.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.323
Macy's the key.

18:43.323 --> 18:46.092
We need to tear her life apart
to find him.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.529
Now, <i>this</i>
is my kind of coffee.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.231
Wait, wait, wait.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.668
My favorite movie was shot
right here on this lot.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.938
Wait.
Your favorite coffee place.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.640
Your favorite movie.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.375
Whoever's doing this
knows you really well.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.378
Chen.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.514
Who is Arthur Andrews?

19:07.514 --> 19:09.782
Arthur Andrews witnessed
a murder

19:09.782 --> 19:11.651
committed by one
of Elijah Stone's relatives.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.886
And you represented
this relative

19:13.886 --> 19:15.988
as a favor to Mr. Stone.
Is that right?

19:15.988 --> 19:18.291
If by "favor," you mean
your client threatened

19:18.291 --> 19:21.728
to hurt me if I refused,
then yeah.

19:21.728 --> 19:25.365
Now, you could have questioned
Mr. Andrews in your office,

19:25.365 --> 19:27.400
but you chose to do it
in his home.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.801
Why?

19:28.801 --> 19:30.303
That was more
convenient for him.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.838
Or you were trying
to intimidate him

19:31.838 --> 19:33.573
and you didn't
want any witnesses.

19:33.573 --> 19:36.209
No. No.

19:36.209 --> 19:38.645
I went there
after your client ordered me

19:38.645 --> 19:42.014
to find a way to undermine
Mr. Andrews' credibility.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.752
He said, "Either you make this
witness go away or Moreno will."

19:45.752 --> 19:48.688
And for the record, Moreno is
one of Elijah Stone's enforcers

19:48.688 --> 19:49.889
who is currently in prison,

19:49.889 --> 19:51.424
awaiting trial
on several charges,

19:51.424 --> 19:53.493
including the attempted murder
of police officers.

19:53.493 --> 19:56.596
<i>Alleged</i> enforcer.

19:56.596 --> 20:01.368
But what we know for a fact
is that you called in a tip

20:01.368 --> 20:04.604
about an illegal firearm
in Mr. Andrews' home.

20:04.604 --> 20:06.038
Yeah. And that tip
saved his life.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.674
According to you, yes.

20:07.674 --> 20:10.910
But your client,
a man accused of murder,

20:10.910 --> 20:14.080
went free because
you damaged the reputation...

20:14.080 --> 20:15.382
...of the only witness
against him.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.083
Yeah.
No. It's a good argument. It is.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.351
And if I was on the other side
of that table,

20:18.351 --> 20:19.719
I would be making it myself.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.588
But it's B.S.,
and you know it!
Wes.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.055
I know no such thing.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.091
You just can't admit
that I'm outarguing you.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.393
Yes, if you ignore
the truth!

20:26.393 --> 20:28.761
Wesley, let it go.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.930
You never won an argument in
the five years we were together.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.465
What makes you think now
is going to be any different?

20:32.465 --> 20:33.966
Uh-huh.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.134
Why-- Why don't we pick this up
tomorrow?

20:35.134 --> 20:36.803
Yeah. No.
That's a great idea.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.305
That's perfect.
Of course.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.242
Hey. Wes. Hey. Hold up.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.144
You can't let her
rattle you like that.

20:45.144 --> 20:47.780
Yeah, sorry.
Just lost focus.

20:47.780 --> 20:48.815
Won't happen again.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.417
Okay. Well,
the facts are on our side,

20:50.417 --> 20:51.584
so just focus on that.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.952
Yeah. Right.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.388
I have to ask you this--
how did it end between you two?

20:55.388 --> 20:56.956
Are you asking
if I'm still hung up on her?

20:56.956 --> 20:58.425
Or she on you.
I don't know.

20:58.425 --> 20:59.826
I just need to know
where this thing could go.

20:59.826 --> 21:03.296
Alright. Look. Monica and I
wanted very different lives.

21:03.296 --> 21:04.631
Right out of law school,
she targeted

21:04.631 --> 21:06.265
<i>the</i> most powerful law firms.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.768
I rented a space next to
an aquarium-supply store.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.438
Hm.
It was never gonna work.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.640
Just took us two years
to figure that out.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.608
Okay.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.610
Look, take
the rest of the day,

21:17.610 --> 21:19.846
but tomorrow, you come in
with your game face on, yeah?

21:19.846 --> 21:21.047
Yeah.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.082
Where's my radio?

21:23.082 --> 21:24.584
Did something happen
to your radio?

21:24.584 --> 21:26.653
Oh, you know what?
Halloween <i>is</i> tomorrow.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.521
Maybe a vengeful spirit
took it.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.189
Why are you doing this?

21:30.189 --> 21:32.359
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:32.359 --> 21:34.527
Is holding my radio hostage
payback for how tough

21:34.527 --> 21:35.828
I was on you
as a rookie?

21:35.828 --> 21:38.197
Were you?
Gosh, I hadn't noticed.

21:38.197 --> 21:40.800
Okay.
But again, I don't know
what you're talking about,

21:40.800 --> 21:44.103
but I might be able to help you
look for your radio

21:44.103 --> 21:45.938
if you tell me
what's going on.

21:45.938 --> 21:48.040
Nothing is going on
with me.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.442
Please. I rode with you
long enough

21:49.442 --> 21:53.480
to know when you are being you
and when you're upset.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.047
I mean, are you okay?

21:56.983 --> 22:00.052
It's nothing. I'm fine.

22:00.052 --> 22:02.021
Then I don't know
where your radio is.

22:02.021 --> 22:04.290
You were right about
Macy's finances.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.793
Forensics got into her laptop
and found this.

22:06.793 --> 22:09.396
"SugarBeaus.com.
Opportunities await."

22:09.396 --> 22:11.197
"Anastasia Kennedy."

22:11.197 --> 22:12.632
Macy had a sugar daddy.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.300
Daddies-- plural.

22:14.300 --> 22:15.968
Warrant's in process
of getting their names.

22:15.968 --> 22:18.304
That explains how she paid
for the nice apartment.

22:18.304 --> 22:19.572
You think that's
how she met Harris?

22:19.572 --> 22:21.140
Maybe.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.142
Let me get a look at pictures
as soon as you have a list.

22:23.142 --> 22:25.011
After staring at his face
for the past decade,

22:25.011 --> 22:27.013
I could spot that guy
from space.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.482
<i>♪ You know I want it</i>

22:30.417 --> 22:33.252
♪ I want it all now

22:36.155 --> 22:38.190
I think we need
more tombstones.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.326
Uh, no,
I think we're good.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.565
What's wrong?

22:45.565 --> 22:50.537
The Reeds have declined
our dinner invitation.

22:50.537 --> 22:52.071
What, first trick or treating,
now this?

22:52.071 --> 22:55.274
What-- These people really have
a problem with me being a cop?

22:55.274 --> 22:58.077
That's not why
they're avoiding us.

22:58.077 --> 22:59.746
Honey, did-- did Jenny say
something to you?

23:03.683 --> 23:05.718
Her parents told her
it's not safe here

23:05.718 --> 23:08.621
'cause you hang out
with criminals.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.723
Criminals.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.926
M-Meaning my-- my friends
from the community center?

23:13.926 --> 23:15.462
Lately at school,
Jenny's been repeating

23:15.462 --> 23:18.598
stuff her parents say about
"those people."

23:18.598 --> 23:19.732
And worse.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.233
Okay.
Which house is Jenny's?

23:21.233 --> 23:23.202
I-I-I don't think
confronting them

23:23.202 --> 23:24.036
is going to
be constructive.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.738
Oh, you can screw constructive.

23:25.738 --> 23:29.208
Mom, it's okay.
Just 'cause we live close by

23:29.208 --> 23:31.978
doesn't mean we have
to hang out with her.

23:34.380 --> 23:36.449
Alright. Honey, I'm sorry.
I know--

23:36.449 --> 23:38.585
I know
Jenny was your friend.

23:38.585 --> 23:41.253
Was.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.556
I'm gonna go inside, okay?

23:43.556 --> 23:45.091
Okay. But listen,
you can talk to us

23:45.091 --> 23:46.125
about anything, right?

23:46.125 --> 23:47.126
Okay.

23:47.126 --> 23:49.496
Hm.

23:53.332 --> 23:55.968
It's not right.
It's not.

23:59.572 --> 24:00.907
Thirsty?

24:00.907 --> 24:02.008
I'm fine.

24:02.008 --> 24:05.111
Mm. I'm just saying...

24:05.111 --> 24:07.246
130,000
is a lot of Scovilles.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.482
You realize I've literally
been on fire before.

24:13.753 --> 24:16.355
Mm! Mm! Hm!

24:16.355 --> 24:18.124
Yes!

24:18.124 --> 24:22.762
Bailey 22, Nolan 21.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.931
I've made
a terrible mistake.

24:24.931 --> 24:26.432
I'm thinking
a wedding in May.

24:26.432 --> 24:28.601
We'll miss Mardi Gras,
but the weather will be nice,

24:28.601 --> 24:30.703
and we'll have plenty of time
to get out save-the-dates.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.138
You still have to win by 2.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.773
I think you should quit
while you're behind.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.007
Mm.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.482
I can't sleep.
As soon as I close my eyes,

24:43.482 --> 24:45.184
all I could think about
is you warning me

24:45.184 --> 24:47.319
how dangerous it is for me
to be on duty half asleep.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.721
And I can't-- I-I don't know
what else to do.

24:48.721 --> 24:49.989
What do I do?

24:49.989 --> 24:52.725
Uh...
Hey, come here.

24:52.725 --> 24:54.493
There is no training
that could prep you

24:54.493 --> 24:57.229
for the amount of stress
we are put under day after day.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.298
It'll take some time,
but your body will adapt.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.901
Okay? Why don't you
go sit on the couch?

25:01.901 --> 25:03.369
Okay.
How about some tea?

25:03.369 --> 25:04.837
Yeah. Okay.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.205
Chamomile knocks me out.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.406
So does music.

25:07.406 --> 25:09.475
Uh, actually, valerian root
works better,

25:09.475 --> 25:10.677
and don't play music.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.212
That'll keep her up.
She wants white noise.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.381
How is static gonna help her
get to sleep?

25:15.381 --> 25:16.983
Not static. Science.

25:16.983 --> 25:18.551
You want to bet,
Professor?

25:18.551 --> 25:21.053
Whoever can get Celina
to fall asleep first wins.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.589
How is that even a contest?

25:22.589 --> 25:24.256
Well, we take turns,
and if she falls asleep

25:24.256 --> 25:25.491
on your turn, you win.

25:25.491 --> 25:27.359
Yeah, but you can't separate out
the cause.

25:27.359 --> 25:30.429
I mean, what if she gets sleepy
listening to white noise

25:30.429 --> 25:32.064
but doesn't fall asleep
until she hears music?

25:32.064 --> 25:34.033
Sounds like you're afraid
my way might be better.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.101
I'm not afraid.

25:35.101 --> 25:36.335
You sound afraid.

25:36.335 --> 25:37.737
Okay. I see what
you're trying to do here.

25:37.737 --> 25:38.738
I see you.
Mm-hmm.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.406
She's trying to--

25:45.578 --> 25:46.545
We'll call it a tie.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.914
Yeah.

25:52.852 --> 25:53.853
Hey.

25:55.622 --> 25:58.557
Hey.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.426
Whiskey?

26:00.426 --> 26:02.629
When did you
start drinking whiskey?

26:02.629 --> 26:05.097
I went to Vegas for the weekend,
and when I came back,

26:05.097 --> 26:06.633
my fiancée
had cleared her things out.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.367
Mm.

26:08.367 --> 26:10.236
Maybe she was mad
that you cheated on her.

26:10.236 --> 26:11.871
Oh. Is that why you took
this case?

26:11.871 --> 26:12.605
To get back at me?

26:12.605 --> 26:14.641
Wow. The narcissism.

26:14.641 --> 26:16.208
I did not miss that.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.610
Oh, <i>I'm</i> the narcissist?

26:17.610 --> 26:21.313
Wesley, you think it's
your mission to personally save

26:21.313 --> 26:23.249
all the downtrodden
of Los Angeles.

26:23.249 --> 26:24.651
Mm-hmm. Well, at least I'm
trying instead of selling

26:24.651 --> 26:26.085
my soul
for $800 an hour.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.287
Okay. Some of us have to work
for a living.

26:28.287 --> 26:30.089
I don't have a trust fund
to fall back on.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.158
I didn't say
don't make money.

26:32.158 --> 26:34.927
I'm saying Elijah
is dangerous.

26:34.927 --> 26:35.928
I can handle him.

26:35.928 --> 26:38.497
No, you can't.

26:38.497 --> 26:41.968
He is a manipulator,
and he is always 10 steps ahead.

26:41.968 --> 26:44.336
So whatever control you think
you have, that is an illusion.

26:44.336 --> 26:47.073
And the second you stop
doing his bidding,

26:47.073 --> 26:48.941
he will threaten
the people you love.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.277
You'll live in terror,
and you will compromise

26:51.277 --> 26:52.578
every principle
you hold dear

26:52.578 --> 26:54.647
until you don't
even recognize yourself.

26:57.349 --> 26:59.986
Principles always were
your thing.

26:59.986 --> 27:01.320
Hi.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.623
Oh. Detective Lopez.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.759
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

27:06.759 --> 27:08.460
And you are?

27:10.697 --> 27:13.966
Oh, she doesn't know.
Uh, well, then,

27:13.966 --> 27:16.435
I should
definitely get going.

27:16.435 --> 27:18.671
You two have some things
to, uh, talk about.

27:18.671 --> 27:20.339
I'll see you at
your deposition tomorrow.

27:26.946 --> 27:29.181
Um, I'm gonna need
another one of these.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.149
You're probably gonna
want one, too.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.617
Wesley?

27:31.617 --> 27:34.721
It's not a big deal.
Um, I just found out

27:34.721 --> 27:37.957
that she's the lawyer
representing Elijah

27:37.957 --> 27:39.658
this morning.
I was gonna tell you at dinner.

27:41.894 --> 27:44.196
We, um, used to date.

27:46.332 --> 27:47.366
It was more than that.

27:47.366 --> 27:48.701
We were engaged
for about a year.

27:48.701 --> 27:51.637
But we were bad
for each other,

27:51.637 --> 27:55.674
and I blew it up by cheating
on her with a co-worker.

27:56.709 --> 27:58.510
So much for date night.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.582
Good morning. Morning.

28:03.582 --> 28:05.351
Thanks for letting me crash.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.519
I, um-- you know,
I felt right at home.

28:07.519 --> 28:08.687
My parents
would bicker back and forth,

28:08.687 --> 28:09.922
just like you guys.

28:09.922 --> 28:10.990
It always put me
right to sleep.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.591
Oh, I don't know
that I would call

28:12.591 --> 28:13.760
what Bailey and I do bickering.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.195
More like...
spirited debates.

28:16.195 --> 28:19.598
Speaking of spirits, I was just
telling Bailey about my dream.

28:19.598 --> 28:21.433
And here we go.

28:21.433 --> 28:25.838
I dreamt Winslow was a showgirl
wearing a diamond bra.

28:25.838 --> 28:30.042
We were dancing the tango,
and when I realized who he was,

28:30.042 --> 28:31.377
he ran off.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.445
And I tried to stop him,
but all of a sudden,

28:33.445 --> 28:37.116
I was so thirsty, like,
I couldn't move.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.952
And then I woke up.

28:39.952 --> 28:41.053
So, what do you think
it means?

28:42.989 --> 28:45.357
Me? Are we--
Are we are we really doing this?

28:45.357 --> 28:48.260
Well, the tango is
the forbidden dance.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.262
So it could represent
doing something

28:50.262 --> 28:51.530
you're not supposed to do.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.900
Like drug trafficking
or murder.

28:53.900 --> 28:56.302
Okay.
What about the diamonds?

28:56.302 --> 28:58.704
Diamonds are hard
and unchanging.

28:58.704 --> 29:01.207
Clearly, that means Winslow
hasn't changed his ways.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.408
And you dreamed
you were thirsty

29:02.408 --> 29:04.977
because you think
he's near the water.

29:04.977 --> 29:06.278
Yes.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.884
Is this really
how you solve crimes?

29:11.884 --> 29:13.719
I guess we'll find out.

29:15.454 --> 29:16.789
My neighbors are trash.

29:16.789 --> 29:19.291
That is something the home
inspection does not tell you.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.293
And I wouldn't care,
but now they're dragging Lila

29:21.293 --> 29:23.562
into the middle
of their narrow-minded B.S.

29:23.562 --> 29:26.332
I'm sorry.

29:26.332 --> 29:29.735
Wesley used to be engaged
to Elijah's new attorney.

29:29.735 --> 29:31.137
You're kidding.

29:31.137 --> 29:33.405
No. And it ended
because <i>he</i> cheated on <i>her.</i>

29:33.405 --> 29:35.274
Oh, I did not know
he had that in him.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.575
Neither did I.

29:36.575 --> 29:38.477
And now I'm pissed because
he never told me

29:38.477 --> 29:40.579
I have to go sit across
from his ex in a deposition

29:40.579 --> 29:43.315
where she's gonna do everything
she can to get under my skin.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.784
Uh, maybe leave
your gun here.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.821
Maybe not.

29:48.821 --> 29:50.756
I looked at every
sugar daddy Macy's had.

29:50.756 --> 29:52.358
None of them are Harris.

29:52.358 --> 29:56.662
Well, the DNA from the necklace
was a match to Winslow.

29:56.662 --> 29:58.430
I've gone to bed every night
for the past 10 years

29:58.430 --> 30:01.100
wondering,
"Did I screw up?

30:01.100 --> 30:03.035
Am I the reason
my partner got made?"

30:03.035 --> 30:04.803
Look, you have only ever been
on the outside

30:04.803 --> 30:06.038
of an undercover op.

30:06.038 --> 30:07.806
I have lived for years
on the inside.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.977
And trust me, what happened
wasn't your fault.

30:10.977 --> 30:15.281
Guys, Celina had
an out-of-the-box idea

30:15.281 --> 30:16.983
that we did
our due diligence on,

30:16.983 --> 30:18.384
and I think
it's worth pursuing.

30:18.384 --> 30:19.886
From Macy's
credit-card statements, I mean,

30:19.886 --> 30:22.054
you can tell she spent time
down in the marina district

30:22.054 --> 30:23.655
during the last six months.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.358
But none of her sugar daddy
clients are based there.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.027
You think she
was meeting Winslow?

30:28.027 --> 30:30.229
It makes sense. I mean,
he lived his life around boats.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.331
Maybe he got back
into drug smuggling.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.033
I'd have heard if he got
back in the game.

30:34.033 --> 30:36.035
I mean, catching him
has been my obsession.

30:36.035 --> 30:38.905
Well, then maybe he found
a legit job in the marina,

30:38.905 --> 30:40.907
and that's where they met
and fell in love.

30:40.907 --> 30:42.574
Love?
How'd you get there?

30:42.574 --> 30:43.910
I felt it.

30:43.910 --> 30:46.212
Uh, but-- but
a-a romantic relationship

30:46.212 --> 30:48.247
<i>would</i> explain how Macy got
close enough to Winslow

30:48.247 --> 30:49.982
to try
to deposit that money.

30:49.982 --> 30:52.318
And how he got
into her apartment to kill her.

30:52.318 --> 30:54.053
Either way,
the marina is a big place,

30:54.053 --> 30:55.554
and we are running out
of time.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.323
He could be getting ready
to sail to Mexico.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.391
Well, Macy's credit card
had a bunch of charges

30:59.391 --> 31:01.160
at parking meters
near Pier 9.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.494
Okay. I will call
the Port Police

31:02.494 --> 31:03.495
and have them
meet you there.

31:03.495 --> 31:04.463
Let's go.

31:09.635 --> 31:11.337
Detective Lopez.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.272
I hope you and Wesley
had a lovely date night.

31:13.272 --> 31:14.573
It was great.
Thank you.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.708
Let's dig in,
shall we?

31:16.708 --> 31:18.610
Mid-Wilshire station logs shows
your husband visited

31:18.610 --> 31:21.547
a suspect in custody
by the name of Aiden Merritt.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.582
If that's what's in
the logs.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.584
What's not in the logs
is the fact that the next day,

31:25.584 --> 31:28.187
Merritt was found dead
in his cell at the Twin Towers.

31:28.187 --> 31:30.957
He'd been shanked
by a fellow inmate.

31:30.957 --> 31:33.459
Were you aware that your husband
represented this inmate

31:33.459 --> 31:34.593
that killed Merritt?

31:34.593 --> 31:37.096
I don't keep tabs
on my husband's clients.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.098
I'd keep a close eye
on him if I were you.

31:39.098 --> 31:40.632
I don't have to.
I trust him.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.701
Here's the thing--

31:42.701 --> 31:44.870
Merritt's killer is prepared
to testify

31:44.870 --> 31:47.373
that Wesley paid him
to commit the murder.

31:47.373 --> 31:48.374
That didn't happen.

31:48.374 --> 31:49.608
How can you be certain?

31:49.608 --> 31:51.143
Maybe you don't know
your husband

31:51.143 --> 31:52.544
as well as you think you do.
I know my husband
is not a killer.

31:52.544 --> 31:54.380
Elijah is.

31:54.380 --> 31:56.082
Let me tell you
what it looks like to me.

31:56.082 --> 31:58.750
It looks like your husband
tried to coerce Merritt

31:58.750 --> 32:00.419
into pointing the finger
at my client,

32:00.419 --> 32:03.222
and when he refused,
your husband had him killed.

32:03.222 --> 32:05.224
I've dealt with a lot
of shady lawyers in my day,

32:05.224 --> 32:06.959
but you are next level. Please.
The personal attacks

32:06.959 --> 32:07.893
are so unprofessional. Okay.

32:07.893 --> 32:09.495
It's...
Unprofessional?

32:09.495 --> 32:10.896
You're paying one of Wesley's
clients to give

32:10.896 --> 32:12.898
false testimony.
I did nothing
of the sort.

32:12.898 --> 32:15.067
Then Elijah did.
It doesn't matter.

32:15.067 --> 32:17.003
What matters is what a jury
will believe.

32:17.003 --> 32:19.138
And the slipshod way you ran
this investigation

32:19.138 --> 32:20.772
has provided ample
reasonable doubt.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.976
Honestly, if Elijah goes free,
it will not be because of me,

32:23.976 --> 32:25.244
it'll be because of you.

32:25.244 --> 32:27.346
Okay. Let's just take
a break here, hmm?

32:28.981 --> 32:30.282
Let's.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.084
Great idea.
You and I should talk.

32:34.553 --> 32:36.622
I get what you were trying
to do in there,

32:36.622 --> 32:38.290
and that was clever,

32:38.290 --> 32:40.759
but the fact of the matter is,
we caught your client

32:40.759 --> 32:43.996
in a warehouse
filled with illegal narcotics.

32:43.996 --> 32:47.966
My client was just as shocked
as the LAPD.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.969
Elijah Stone is an upstanding
member of his community.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.604
The only crime here
is that one of the people

32:52.604 --> 32:55.107
he took under his wing
betrayed his trust,

32:55.107 --> 32:56.542
exploiting
my client's goodwill

32:56.542 --> 32:59.645
to further
their own criminal endeavors.

32:59.645 --> 33:02.881
Do you really expect anyone
to believe that Elijah Stone

33:02.881 --> 33:06.018
was oblivious to a massive
drug-smuggling operation

33:06.018 --> 33:07.686
going on right under his nose?

33:07.686 --> 33:09.021
It won't matter.

33:09.021 --> 33:10.722
Okay.
We'll see about that.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.494
Honestly...

33:15.494 --> 33:20.132
the optics of your case
are a hot mess.

33:20.132 --> 33:23.869
If you take this to trial,
I will drag the LAPD

33:23.869 --> 33:27.473
and the DA's office
through five miles of mud.

33:27.473 --> 33:29.808
You and your boss will be lucky
to survive the scandal

33:29.808 --> 33:31.143
with your jobs.

33:31.143 --> 33:34.846
So... do yourself a favor.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.548
Walk away
while you still can.

33:44.723 --> 33:46.325
Hey. Hi.

33:46.325 --> 33:47.593
What the hell
is going on with Tim?

33:47.593 --> 33:48.860
Well, he lost his radio.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.197
I will give you his radio

33:51.197 --> 33:53.365
if you tell me
what's bothering him.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.833
Honestly, I don't know.

33:54.833 --> 33:55.934
He won't tell me either.

33:55.934 --> 33:57.536
What?
Yeah.

33:57.536 --> 33:58.570
Ready to roll?

33:58.570 --> 34:00.606
Mm-hmm.

34:00.606 --> 34:01.907
Hi. Good morning.

34:01.907 --> 34:03.442
Morning.

34:03.442 --> 34:04.543
Still missing your radio?

34:04.543 --> 34:05.911
No. It's in the shop.

34:05.911 --> 34:07.779
<i>7-Adam-100,
officers on event.</i>

34:07.779 --> 34:10.549
<i>7-99 are calling
for a supervisor.</i>

34:13.952 --> 34:16.122
Copy. Show me en route.

34:16.122 --> 34:18.124
Where is
your standard issue?

34:18.124 --> 34:19.358
This is it.

34:19.358 --> 34:21.760
That hasn't been standard
since the '60s.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.529
Let's roll, Thorsen.

34:23.529 --> 34:26.398
Well, wait. Let me get a photo
of you with it first.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.872
7-Adam-100,
can I get a radio check, please?

34:35.207 --> 34:37.109
7-Adam-100, do you copy?

34:56.228 --> 34:58.464
Where's the guard?

34:58.464 --> 35:00.299
Harper said
he'd meet us here.

35:00.299 --> 35:01.167
God, this place is massive.
I mean,

35:01.167 --> 35:02.501
Harris could be anywhere.

35:02.501 --> 35:03.969
Or he could be
casting off right now.

35:14.313 --> 35:16.648
Let's split up. Go that way.

35:18.850 --> 35:21.019
I was a different person
back then.

35:21.019 --> 35:23.622
I was trying to follow
in my father's footsteps--

35:23.622 --> 35:27.159
the white-shoe law firm,
events at the country club,

35:27.159 --> 35:29.828
Christmas in Mustique.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.897
And I was miserable.

35:33.799 --> 35:36.535
This wasn't
about Monica or her co-worker.

35:36.535 --> 35:38.837
It was a selfish and stupid way
to blow up a life

35:38.837 --> 35:40.806
that was making me unhappy.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.276
But I would never
cheat on you.

35:44.276 --> 35:46.378
I know, 'cause
you're afraid of me.

35:46.378 --> 35:48.214
Because I'm in love
with you.

35:49.215 --> 35:51.717
Hey.

35:51.717 --> 35:55.654
Uh... we're dropping the case
against Elijah.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.389
What?
You can't be serious.

35:57.389 --> 35:59.725
I'm afraid I am.
There's just too much risk

35:59.725 --> 36:01.327
in trying
to take this thing to trial.

36:01.327 --> 36:03.829
I put my family in danger
going after this guy.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.197
Look, I get it's upsetting,

36:05.197 --> 36:07.833
but we're just playing the hand
that you dealt us.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.635
So you're just gonna
let him walk?

36:09.635 --> 36:12.003
It became clear
after these depositions

36:12.003 --> 36:14.206
that this case is a loser.

36:14.206 --> 36:15.807
Look, take a few days,
you know,

36:15.807 --> 36:16.908
get your head on right.

36:16.908 --> 36:18.176
We'll talk about
what's next for you here.

36:32.991 --> 36:34.092
Winslow!

36:35.661 --> 36:36.928
Police!
Show us your hands!

36:43.068 --> 36:46.338
7-Adam-15.
Shots fired at 221 Whaling Way.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.774
<i>Suspect is fugitive
Winslow Harris--</i>

36:48.774 --> 36:52.110
<i>Latino male, black shirt,
dark jeans.</i>

36:52.110 --> 36:54.713
Armed with a handgun.
Requesting airship and backup.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.548
You got no move here,
Winslow! It's over!

36:56.548 --> 36:58.717
You okay?
I'm good.

36:58.717 --> 36:59.718
Move. Move.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.855
<i>You're finally gonna pay
for what you did.</i>

37:03.855 --> 37:05.357
You could just walk away.

37:05.357 --> 37:07.293
That the deal you gave
Macy Tomkins?

37:07.293 --> 37:10.862
That wasn't supposed to happen.

37:10.862 --> 37:13.799
She wasn't supposed to find out!
We were happy!

37:13.799 --> 37:15.801
Tell it to her family.

37:15.801 --> 37:17.269
Tell it to the family
of my partner

37:17.269 --> 37:18.970
and the people who loved him.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.239
<i>You won't believe me,
but I'm-a tell you this anyway.</i>

37:21.239 --> 37:24.142
The night at that deal...

37:24.142 --> 37:26.044
the gun went off.
It just...

37:26.044 --> 37:28.714
It went off in my hand.

37:28.714 --> 37:30.549
I didn't know he was a cop!

37:30.549 --> 37:31.983
None of that matters now.

37:34.886 --> 37:37.289
There are no second chances,
are there?

37:37.289 --> 37:39.925
Not for you.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.493
But I'm living one right now.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.230
Drop the gun.
Do it now.

37:54.172 --> 37:55.941
You're under arrest

37:55.941 --> 37:57.843
for the murders
of Macy Tomkins...

37:57.843 --> 37:59.411
...and Robert Buckley.

38:05.517 --> 38:07.519
So, how'd the debrief go?

38:07.519 --> 38:09.421
To be honest, I checked out
after the words "Winslow Harris"

38:09.421 --> 38:12.157
and "consecutive
life sentences."

38:12.157 --> 38:14.460
I can't tell you
what it means to me,

38:14.460 --> 38:16.762
knowing his killer
is behind bars,

38:16.762 --> 38:18.764
what it means
to finally have answers

38:18.764 --> 38:20.532
about those last moments.

38:20.532 --> 38:21.800
Thank you.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.034
Oh, it was our pleasure.

38:23.034 --> 38:27.706
♪ It's okay if we lose
track of time ♪

38:27.706 --> 38:29.941
Hey, happy Halloween.
You got any plans tonight?

38:29.941 --> 38:31.443
Or should I just assume
you're gonna be inside,

38:31.443 --> 38:32.644
hiding with the lights out?

38:32.644 --> 38:33.679
I don't hide.

38:33.679 --> 38:34.846
I leave a bowl of candy
on the porch.

38:34.846 --> 38:37.015
Oh.
Hey.

38:37.015 --> 38:41.219
Um... here.

38:41.219 --> 38:43.889
I thought torturing you
would be more fun,

38:43.889 --> 38:44.890
and getting your mind off

38:44.890 --> 38:47.192
of whatever's been
bothering you.

38:47.192 --> 38:49.495
But I should know better
than trying to get

38:49.495 --> 38:50.996
into your personal business.

38:53.632 --> 38:55.567
Good night.

38:56.968 --> 38:58.236
Ashley and I, uh, broke up.

39:01.206 --> 39:03.742
Well, I guess technically,
she broke up with me.

39:05.644 --> 39:08.514
I'm sorry. Thanks.

39:08.514 --> 39:11.483
Look, and just so you know,
I-I did appreciate

39:11.483 --> 39:13.919
your whole radio gag...
a little.

39:15.320 --> 39:16.988
It took my mind off things.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.156
Well, good.

39:22.694 --> 39:25.163
Lucy. Ready to go?

39:25.163 --> 39:27.533
Uh, yeah. D--
Uh, do you want to join us?

39:27.533 --> 39:29.334
We're gonna go grab
a bite to eat.

39:29.334 --> 39:30.936
Oh, no, no.
I'm good.

39:30.936 --> 39:33.572
I'm g-- I'm-- I'm beat.

39:33.572 --> 39:36.207
You two have fun.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.609
Mediterranean sound good?

39:37.609 --> 39:38.877
Yeah. That sounds great.

39:51.523 --> 39:53.091
Sweetie, I know that
trick-or-treating

39:53.091 --> 39:55.026
with your parents
isn't cool,

39:55.026 --> 39:58.363
but I happen to think
that our outfits are amazing.

39:58.363 --> 39:59.565
They are.

39:59.565 --> 40:01.433
And I'm actually
having fun with you guys.

40:01.433 --> 40:04.936
Are you, now?

40:04.936 --> 40:10.141
Oh, my God.
Someone TP'ed Jenny's house.

40:10.141 --> 40:11.643
Constructive, huh?

40:13.311 --> 40:14.946
Trick or treat.

40:16.448 --> 40:19.150
Bye! Happy Halloween!
What'd you get?

40:19.150 --> 40:22.220
You just have to admit
I wear it better.

40:22.220 --> 40:23.789
Yeah, you wear everything better.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.156
No one's arguing that.

40:25.156 --> 40:27.292
I didn't agree to compete
over this.

40:27.292 --> 40:28.627
Hey!

40:28.627 --> 40:29.895
Happy Halloween!

40:29.895 --> 40:31.897
Oh, that is a brilliant
costume, young man.

40:31.897 --> 40:33.665
You too, slightly older man.

40:33.665 --> 40:36.602
I don't see many Philly fans
this side of the, uh, Rockies.

40:36.602 --> 40:38.236
You from there?

40:38.236 --> 40:40.405
Uh, Foxburg, actually.
Just moved here a few years ago.

40:40.405 --> 40:42.808
God, you look remarkably
like that fella from CNN.

40:42.808 --> 40:43.809
What's his name?

40:43.809 --> 40:44.810
Jake Tapper.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.011
No, that's not it.

40:46.011 --> 40:47.513
Yeah, it is.

40:47.513 --> 40:48.914
Here.
You guys want some candy?

40:48.914 --> 40:50.115
Thank the nice people.

40:50.115 --> 40:51.917
Thank you.
Roger that.

40:51.917 --> 40:52.918
Have a great night.

40:52.918 --> 40:53.919
See you, guys!
You too!

40:53.919 --> 40:54.686
Hey, yo, hey, yo.

40:54.686 --> 40:56.321
Hey!

40:56.321 --> 40:58.256
Can I, uh, sleep over again?

40:58.256 --> 41:00.258
I don't know
that that's a great idea.

41:00.258 --> 41:02.293
Didn't you say quality sleep
is important

41:02.293 --> 41:03.629
for good police work?

41:03.629 --> 41:06.097
Yeah, but I don't sound
like that, do I?

41:06.097 --> 41:08.534
And you want your rookie
to do good police work.

41:08.534 --> 41:09.701
Obviously.

41:09.701 --> 41:11.937
Great. Come on in.
You can sleep here tonight.

41:11.937 --> 41:13.204
I will get the chamomile.

41:13.204 --> 41:14.940
Okay.
But this is the last time.

41:14.940 --> 41:17.108
Mm-hmm.
And didn't we agree
that valerian root

41:17.108 --> 41:18.176
was better for sleep?

41:18.176 --> 41:20.011
Chamomile is easier
on the stomach.

41:20.011 --> 41:21.146
Where did you hear that?

41:28.720 --> 41:31.456
Wesley Evers,
attorney at law.

41:33.559 --> 41:36.327
I told you.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.129
I always win.

41:40.465 --> 41:41.833
Oh, you really think
this is over?

41:41.833 --> 41:46.171
Are you kidding?
You messed up my case so bad

41:46.171 --> 41:49.140
that no one's gonna want
to touch me.

41:49.140 --> 41:52.811
I figure I got
a two-year free pass.

41:52.811 --> 41:55.513
You know, coming after me
before then would be unseemly,

41:55.513 --> 42:00.852
given how compromised
you and your LAPD buddies look.

42:00.852 --> 42:04.522
I wouldn't count on that.

42:04.522 --> 42:06.592
Well, I think
I'm pretty untouchable.

42:09.327 --> 42:13.331
I have some business
to take care of, but, uh...

42:13.331 --> 42:15.934
I'll be seeing you, Counselor.

42:25.744 --> 42:28.614
