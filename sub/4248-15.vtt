12:38.174 --> 12:39.967
PATRICIA?

12:41.302 --> 12:43.179
- WELL, THEN.
- WELL, THEN.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.138
- THIS IS WEIRD.

12:44.221 --> 12:48.934
- JUST A BIT.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.437
MICK, I HAVE TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.482
- NO, I HAVE
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.775
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.945
- I HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.739
- THE REAL MARA.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.365
- YOU NEVER SEEMED
TO NOTICE REAL MARA.

13:03.449 --> 13:07.703
- I WAS IN DENIAL.

13:07.786 --> 13:10.206
- AFTER YOU AND AMBER FINISHED,

13:10.289 --> 13:12.708
I THOUGHT YOU WERE STARTING
TO LIKE ME.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.293
- I WAS.

13:14.376 --> 13:18.339
- BUT THEN, AFTER THAT KISS,
I WAS SURE THAT YOU DIDN'T.

13:18.422 --> 13:21.550
AND I STARTED TO GET JEALOUS
OF SOMEONE ELSE.

13:21.634 --> 13:25.221
- MICK, MR. SWEET'S WAITING
FOR YOU IN HIS OFFICE.

13:25.304 --> 13:28.724
- YEAH, I'LL GO.
I'LL GO NOW.

13:28.807 --> 13:31.268
I CAN TAKE WHATEVER PUNISHMENT
HE GIVES ME.

13:31.352 --> 13:34.647
I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.318
- NO, MICK, WAIT.
I HAVEN'T FINISHED.

13:39.401 --> 13:41.237
- JUST TELL ME LATER, YEAH?

13:48.744 --> 13:49.870
- YOU OKAY, AMBER?

13:51.830 --> 13:55.459
ARE YOU UPSET BECAUSE
I CUT YOUR CANARY SCENE?

13:55.543 --> 13:57.169
- [laughs]

13:57.253 --> 13:58.963
YEAH, MR. WINKLER,
I'M REALLY UPSET

13:59.046 --> 14:00.839
I DIDN'T GET
TO MAKE A TOTAL FOOL OF MYSELF

14:00.923 --> 14:03.217
FLAPPING AROUND LIKE A LUMP
OF CUSTARD WITH A BEAK.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.218
- [laughs]
YEAH, OKAY.

14:04.301 --> 14:05.177
OKAY, AMBER.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.721
I'M SURE YOU WOULD PULL OFF
ANY COSTUME.

14:07.805 --> 14:11.517
- YEAH, YOU'VE GOT A POINT.
- [laughs]

14:11.600 --> 14:12.685
[mysterious music]

14:12.768 --> 14:16.230
- RUFUS.
- I THOUGHT I SAID HALF AN HOUR.

14:16.313 --> 14:17.648
- I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR JOY.

14:17.731 --> 14:18.774
- WELL, DID YOU FIND HER?
- NO.

14:18.857 --> 14:21.777
I WAS HOPING
SHE MIGHT BE WITH YOU.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.946
DID YOU KNOW SHE WAS GONNA BE
AT THE PLAY?

14:24.029 --> 14:26.448
- YES, I ARRANGED
TO MEET HER THERE,

14:26.532 --> 14:27.116
AND THEN VICTOR
SPOTTED HER AND--

14:27.199 --> 14:29.285
- I KNOW.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.661
I SAW HIM CHASING HER.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.705
DO YOU THINK HE CAUGHT HER?

14:32.788 --> 14:35.040
- LET'S HOPE NOT.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.084
HOW DID YOU SPOT HER
IN THE AUDIENCE?

14:37.167 --> 14:40.254
- SHE WROTE ME A NOTE.
DIDN'T SHE TELL YOU?

14:40.337 --> 14:42.798
- YEAH,
IT'S VERY NAUGHTY OF HER.

14:42.881 --> 14:44.550
WHAT IF THAT HAD GOT
IN THE WRONG HANDS?

14:44.633 --> 14:46.802
- IT WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED.
SHE WROTE IT IN CODE.

14:46.885 --> 14:48.804
LOOK.
IT'S BACKWARD WRITING.

14:48.887 --> 14:52.308
"9:00, CLEARING IN THE WOODS,
JOY."

14:52.891 --> 14:53.809
- WELL, THAT'S CLEVER.

14:53.892 --> 14:56.437
- I THINK SHE MEANS
THE MAIN CLEARING,

14:56.520 --> 14:57.938
NEAR BLUEBELL LANE.

14:58.022 --> 15:01.233
- WE CANNOT LET THEM GET
THEIR HANDS ON JOY, PATRICIA.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.776
- I KNOW.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.612
WHAT IF THEY ALREADY HAVE?

15:04.695 --> 15:08.157
- NO.
I AM CERTAIN THAT JOY IS OKAY.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.618
I THINK SHE WILL BE THERE
TO MEET YOU.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.745
CAN YOU GET THERE?
- YES.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.830
I'LL HAVE TO GO BACK
AND SIGN OUT,

15:14.913 --> 15:16.123
MAKE SURE NOBODY MISSES ME.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.333
- ALL RIGHT.

15:17.416 --> 15:17.958
MEET ME THERE IN AN HOUR,
AT THE CLEARING.

15:23.922 --> 15:24.923
- [laughing]

15:25.007 --> 15:27.718
OH, PARTY FOOD
GIVES ME INDIGESTION.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.178
- OH, ME TOO.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.263
OH, I'VE GOT SOME HOMEMADE
HOT POT IN THE FRIDGE.

15:31.347 --> 15:32.931
I'LL HEAT IT UP.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.808
- OH-HO.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.644
- OH, HELLO, SWEETIE.

15:36.727 --> 15:38.520
WHY AREN'T YOU AT THE PARTY
WITH THE OTHERS?

15:38.604 --> 15:39.772
- MY AUNT AND UNCLE
WERE AT THE SCHOOL PLAY.

15:39.855 --> 15:42.191
THEY'RE TAKING ME OUT TO SUPPER.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.400
- OH, THAT'S NICE.
HAVE YOU SIGNED OUT?

15:43.484 --> 15:45.903
- YEAH.

15:45.986 --> 15:48.447
THE THING IS, I MIGHT BE STAYING
AT THEIR HOUSE TONIGHT.

15:48.530 --> 15:49.365
IS THAT OKAY?

15:49.448 --> 15:51.075
- WELL, AS LONG
AS YOU'RE AT SCHOOL

15:51.158 --> 15:52.326
FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING.

15:52.409 --> 15:53.619
- YEAH, YEAH, I WILL.

15:53.702 --> 15:54.912
- ARE THEY OUTSIDE?

15:54.995 --> 15:56.372
WOULD THEY LIKE TO COME IN
FOR A CUP OF TEA?

15:56.455 --> 15:58.749
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
WE NEED TO GET GOING.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.959
I JUST CAME BACK TO GET CHANGED
AND SIGN OUT.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.671
- OKAY.
- OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU.

16:03.754 --> 16:04.963
- BYE.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.092
- SO WHERE'S THIS HOT POT, THEN?
- OH.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.718
- YOU KNOW THAT THE WAY
TO A MAN'S HEART

16:09.802 --> 16:11.136
IS THROUGH HIS STOMACH.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.513
- NO, I DIDN'T KNOW.

16:12.596 --> 16:13.639
- I'M REALLY, REALLY WORRIED
ABOUT PATRICIA.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.766
WE SHOULD HAVE STOPPED HER.

16:15.849 --> 16:17.518
- HAVE YOU MET PATRICIA?

16:17.601 --> 16:22.314
BECAUSE THERE'S NO STOPPING HER
WHEN SHE WANTS TO DO SOMETHING.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.900
- MR. WINKLER.

16:24.983 --> 16:28.904
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE SUBJECT MATTER

16:28.987 --> 16:29.405
OF YOUR LITTLE PLAY.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.448
- OH, YES?

16:31.532 --> 16:33.242
DID YOU ENJOY IT?

16:33.325 --> 16:35.077
- HMM.

16:35.160 --> 16:40.124
"ENJOY" IS PERHAPS NOT EXACTLY
THE RIGHT WORD.

16:40.207 --> 16:43.085
- SOME OF THE THEMES, JASON,

16:43.168 --> 16:47.881
TOUCH ON THE HISTORY
OF OUR SOCIETY.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.216
- OH, REALLY?

16:49.299 --> 16:50.384
- REALLY.

16:50.467 --> 16:51.385
AND LET ME GUESS.

16:51.468 --> 16:54.596
THE PEOPLE WHO CAME UP
WITH THE IDEAS WERE

16:54.680 --> 16:58.225
NINA MARTIN, FABIAN RUTTER,
AND PATRICIA WILLIAMSON.

16:58.308 --> 17:00.060
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,

17:00.144 --> 17:01.645
IT WAS AMBER MILLINGTON
WHO HAD THE--

17:01.729 --> 17:03.021
- [scoffs]
AMBER MILLINGTON? NEVER.

17:03.105 --> 17:06.567
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TWO BRAIN CELLS
TO RUB TOGETHER.

17:06.650 --> 17:09.528
- ACTUALLY, SHE'S A LOT SMARTER
THAN SHE APPEARS.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.280
BUT THEN, YOU KNOW,
COME TO THINK OF IT,

17:11.363 --> 17:15.909
IT WAS NINA AND FABIAN WHO
RESEARCHED AND WROTE THE PLAY.

17:15.992 --> 17:17.118
- I KNEW IT.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.829
- VICTOR KEEPS STARING AT ME
WITH HIS POINTY FACE.

17:19.913 --> 17:22.332
DO YOU THINK THEY KNOW?
- KNOW WHAT?

17:22.415 --> 17:24.126
- THAT I'VE TAKEN
THE PUZZLE PIECE.

17:24.209 --> 17:24.960
- NO, NOT YET.

17:25.042 --> 17:27.588
HE HASN'T BEEN
BACK TO THE HOUSE.

17:27.671 --> 17:30.591
I THINK THAT'S JUST
HIS USUAL LOOK.

17:32.426 --> 17:33.343
[knock at door]

17:33.427 --> 17:34.720
- COME.

17:34.803 --> 17:38.807
AH, CAMPBELL.
SIT DOWN.

17:40.267 --> 17:41.477
- I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO SAY,

17:41.560 --> 17:42.853
AND IT'S NOT TRUE,

17:42.936 --> 17:44.646
AND YOU CAN HAVE THESE BACK.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.984
- MISS ROBINSON SHOULD NEVER
HAVE GIVEN YOU THOSE.

17:49.067 --> 17:50.569
- SHE HAD EVERY RIGHT.

17:50.652 --> 17:51.695
THEY'RE PICTURES OF HER AND ME.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.031
- INDEED THEY ARE.

17:54.114 --> 17:56.950
- WHICH WERE OBVIOUSLY TAKEN
BY SOME SICK INDIVIDUAL WHO--

17:57.034 --> 18:00.162
[knock at door]

18:02.414 --> 18:03.707
- YOU CAN'T EXPEL HIM,

18:03.791 --> 18:04.875
AND YOU CAN'T FINE
MISS ROBINSON EITHER.

18:04.958 --> 18:07.169
- THAT'S VERY NOBLE
OF YOU, MARA,

18:07.252 --> 18:09.338
BUT IF YOU'D KINDLY
LET ME HANDLE THIS.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.507
- IT WAS ME.
I TOOK THE PHOTOS.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.968
- WHAT?

18:15.052 --> 18:19.139
- AND THEN I MADE THEM LOOK
MORE THAN THEY REALLY WERE.

18:19.223 --> 18:19.723
- I SEE.

18:19.807 --> 18:22.017
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

18:22.100 --> 18:24.770
- I DON'T KNOW.

18:24.853 --> 18:27.606
BECAUSE I WAS ANGRY AND JEALOUS,
AND I DON'T KNOW.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.191
I'M SO SORRY, MICK.

18:29.274 --> 18:30.984
I TRIED TO TELL YOU EARLIER
AND THEN EARLIER THAN THAT.

18:31.068 --> 18:34.404
- THAT'S SICK, MARA.
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

18:42.579 --> 18:44.456
[electronic beeping]

18:52.631 --> 18:54.007
- NO.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.387
NO!

19:00.973 --> 19:02.432
- WHAT TIME IS IT NOW?

19:02.516 --> 19:05.018
- SAME AS WHEN YOU ASKED ME
30 SECONDS AGO,

19:05.102 --> 19:06.186
9:20.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.564
I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME
TO GET A WATCH.

19:08.647 --> 19:09.565
- SHE'S NOT COMING, IS SHE?

19:09.648 --> 19:12.109
- I DON'T KNOW.

19:12.192 --> 19:15.737
MAYBE SHE CAN'T.
MAYBE THEY GOT TO HER.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.907
- SO NEAR AND YET SO FAR.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.034
MEDDLING IDIOTS.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.078
[cell phone rings]

19:23.161 --> 19:24.121
- HELLO.

19:24.204 --> 19:26.415
- HEY, IT'S NINA.
ARE YOU OKAY?

19:26.498 --> 19:27.624
- IS THAT JOY?

19:27.708 --> 19:29.585
- OH, YEAH.
WHY WOULDN'T I BE OKAY?

19:29.668 --> 19:30.919
- WHERE ARE YOU?

19:31.003 --> 19:31.587
- WE WERE GOING TO MEET JOY.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.755
I'M WITH RUFUS.

19:33.839 --> 19:34.756
HEY!

19:34.840 --> 19:35.799
[phone beeps]

19:35.883 --> 19:37.926
- THE LINE'S GONE DEAD.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.344
- WHY ARE YOU MENTIONING
MY NAME?

19:39.428 --> 19:41.680
I HAVE TOLD YOU:
TO EVERYONE ELSE, I'M RENE.

19:41.763 --> 19:43.348
- IT'S OKAY.
IT'S NINA.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.184
SHE'S NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING.

19:46.268 --> 19:50.606
I CAN'T CALL YOU RENE ANYWAY.
IT'S TOO ABSURD.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.523
- THAT'S WEIRD.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.734
- I'M SURE IT'S JUST
OUT OF BATTERY.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.777
- PROBABLY.
YEAH.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.195
ANYWAY, SHE SOUNDED FINE.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.781
SHE SAID THEY'RE MEETING JOY,
APPARENTLY.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.658
- I TOTALLY FORGOT
TO TELL YOU.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.786
THE WRITING ON PATRICIA'S CARD,
IT WAS MIRRORED WRITING.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.288
IT WAS A SECRET MESSAGE FROM JOY
ASKING TO MEET UP.

20:06.371 --> 20:10.667
- THAT'S KIND OF BIG INFORMATION
TO FORGET TO TELL ME

20:10.751 --> 20:12.961
MAYBE JOY WILL HAVE
SOME ANSWERS.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.130
- OKAY, JOKE OVER.
GIVE ME THE PHONE.

20:15.213 --> 20:16.590
[locks click]

20:16.673 --> 20:18.467
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHY ARE YOU LOCKING THE DOORS?

20:18.550 --> 20:19.009
LET ME OUT.

20:19.092 --> 20:21.053
- BELT UP, PATRICIA.

20:21.136 --> 20:21.803
- OKAY.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.598
WANT TO TELL ME WHY?

20:24.681 --> 20:25.641
- IT'S GONNA BE A BUMPY RIDE.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.477
- LET ME OUT.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.104
[dramatic music]

20:31.188 --> 20:32.856
LET ME OUT!
