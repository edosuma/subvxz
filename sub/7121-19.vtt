- Jake, you made this?
- Yeah.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.507
And you buried the
treasure right here?

00:40.582 --> 00:41.629
Uh-huh.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.585
Jake, you're awesome!

00:46.213 --> 00:49.137
This is so cool.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.265
A suitcase?

00:56.348 --> 00:57.770
Oh, man!

00:57.849 --> 00:59.351
I found it in the dump

00:59.434 --> 01:01.357
and then buried it
without looking inside.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.234
Whoa.

01:03.313 --> 01:06.157
Wait a second, man.
I know this case.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.577
One night, while you were
away at Lady's house,

01:08.652 --> 01:10.450
I was dancing in the woods.

01:10.529 --> 01:12.497
Evil tapes. Evil!

01:12.573 --> 01:15.543
Perchance, I saw the Ice King
doing something suspicious.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.711
So I trailed him to the dump,

01:17.786 --> 01:20.380
where he buried this
case in the ground.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.378
You're evil tapes!

01:22.457 --> 01:24.130
Full of evil secrets!

01:24.209 --> 01:26.132
That's why I'm going to bury you

01:26.211 --> 01:29.090
where no one will
ever find you...

01:29.172 --> 01:31.049
under all these boogers!

01:31.133 --> 01:32.476
Whee!

01:32.551 --> 01:33.894
Whee!

01:33.969 --> 01:37.269
I waited for him to leave.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.475
But he played in those
boogers for hours.

01:39.558 --> 01:42.687
I decided to come back
later for the case.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.316
But I lost track of it.

01:44.396 --> 01:47.320
- Whoa! And I found it?
- Mm-hmm.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.786
Let's have a secret screening.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.863
I'll make some fliers for it.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.833
There, now nobody
will bother us.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.506
Jake! Jake, come on!

02:08.461 --> 02:11.841
Okay, you can play
this, right, Beemo?

02:11.923 --> 02:13.015
Yes, Finn.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.513
It goes in my butt.

02:14.593 --> 02:17.187
Oh.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.264
This is so exciting!

02:22.225 --> 02:24.193
Hello, dear diary.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.816
Pretty good day so far.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.523
Got up bright and early,

02:27.606 --> 02:29.950
had a healthy and
slimming breakfast,

02:30.025 --> 02:31.743
did 14 minutes of cardio.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.321
Dude, what are we watching?

02:34.404 --> 02:36.748
I think it's the
Ice King's diary.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.666
I mean, I'm not gonna win

02:38.742 --> 02:40.460
carpenter of the
year or anything,

02:40.535 --> 02:43.459
but it's a place to hang
up the old toothbrush.

02:43.538 --> 02:46.041
Wenk.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.718
Gunter. Hey, Gunter.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.388
Get... getaway from
the camera, sweetie.

02:51.463 --> 02:53.761
Papa's recording his
innermost thoughts.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.593
Remember, I explained
this to you?

02:56.677 --> 02:59.931
Hey, Gunter.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.266
Gunter! - Wenk.

03:02.349 --> 03:05.273
Well, anyway, as you can
see, I'm not wearing my...

03:05.352 --> 03:06.353
Wenk.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.438
I'm not wearing my...

03:08.522 --> 03:09.364
Wenk, wenk.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.487
Sweetie, I raised my voice

03:11.566 --> 03:14.319
because you were giving
me the silent treatment.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.405
You understand? - Wenk.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.660
I love you.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.116
Can we fast-forward?

03:19.199 --> 03:21.293
N-No, man, we might
miss something.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.746
There must be more
to life than this.

03:24.830 --> 03:25.830
Wenk.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.842
I know, you don't like
when I'm contemplative.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.510
C-Contemplative? No.

03:30.585 --> 03:33.839
Con-tem-plat... C...
let's put on a play!

03:33.922 --> 03:35.265
What?!

03:35.340 --> 03:38.560
Oh, Ice King, you're so cool!

03:38.635 --> 03:41.138
You take such good
care of yourself!

03:41.221 --> 03:43.394
I want to be with you!

03:43.473 --> 03:44.941
Wenk, wenk, wenk!

03:45.016 --> 03:46.393
No, Gunter, beard stays on.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.272
Wenk.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.446
Gunter, I need you
to wear the beard!

03:49.521 --> 03:50.773
- Wenk.
- Gunter!

03:50.856 --> 03:52.324
Hey, pause it, Beemo.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.278
There's got to be some
evil secrets in here.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.862
I want to keep watching.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.037
Okay-

03:58.113 --> 04:00.662
Well, why don't I
make us some snacks?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.414
So I don't have to watch this.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.119
Can we sit on the floor?

04:04.202 --> 04:06.500
I feel so far away
from you guys.

04:08.749 --> 04:09.545
Wenk.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.467
Aha!

04:11.543 --> 04:13.545
Now hold still.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.847
You moved!

04:15.922 --> 04:19.596
Ooh, what's this?

04:21.386 --> 04:22.933
Secret tapes?!

04:23.013 --> 04:24.230
I wanna watch!

04:24.306 --> 04:26.149
Catch you later, Gunter.

04:26.224 --> 04:27.224
Wenk.

04:39.571 --> 04:42.745
Gunter, no!

04:42.824 --> 04:43.996
Gunter!

04:44.075 --> 04:45.076
Dance p...

04:45.160 --> 04:46.161
Gunter!

04:46.244 --> 04:48.918
Dance party!

04:54.795 --> 04:56.422
Thanks, Gunter.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.841
Mmm!

04:59.925 --> 05:01.768
You're Gunter.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.604
Wenk, wenk, wenk, wenk.

05:04.679 --> 05:07.057
Oh, fine, who needs you?

05:07.140 --> 05:08.642
More dance party for us.

05:08.725 --> 05:11.023
Right, Gunter?

05:11.102 --> 05:12.399
Oh! Uh...

05:14.773 --> 05:16.616
May I have this dance?

05:18.652 --> 05:21.826
There's probably some
evil secrets coming up.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.497
Someone wants to see
the secret tapes!

05:26.576 --> 05:27.748
What?!

05:27.828 --> 05:30.377
Oh, but I was so
clear in my flier.

05:30.455 --> 05:33.254
Let's peek through the
window and check who it is.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.835
Maybe it's just a pizza.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.386
Right!

05:36.461 --> 05:38.384
- Hey, hey!
- What?!

05:38.463 --> 05:40.682
You guys are checking too loud!

05:40.757 --> 05:43.180
Oh, you're right.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.637
More quietly.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.307
I'm quieter now.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.484
Cool.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.239
Hey. guys, it's me.

06:00.318 --> 06:03.071
Can I come in and watch the
secret tapes with you?

06:03.154 --> 06:04.906
I brought some gifts.

06:04.990 --> 06:07.084
Aah!

06:07.158 --> 06:09.126
Okay, if we're
quiet long enough,

06:09.202 --> 06:12.206
Ice King will think no
one's home and go away.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.552
Ah, no one's home.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.629
Guess I'll go away.

06:22.757 --> 06:23.804
Aah! Aah! Ohh!

06:23.884 --> 06:24.884
Huh?

06:25.677 --> 06:26.929
Just turn your alarm off!

06:27.012 --> 06:29.140
Hmm, that sounds like Beemo.

06:35.687 --> 06:38.281
My alarm says it's
time for Finn's bath.

06:38.356 --> 06:39.608
Finn, get naked.

06:39.691 --> 06:42.194
No, just hit your snooze button!

06:42.277 --> 06:43.870
I cannot self-snooze.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.743
It's against my programming.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.075
Well, then, tell
me how to do it!

06:50.076 --> 06:55.424
Press and hold, then press the
button on top of my head.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.085
Phew!

06:58.168 --> 06:59.420
I'm sorry.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.596
We can still take a bath.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.091
He must know we're
watching his tapes.

07:05.175 --> 07:08.054
We need to find his
secrets faster.

07:10.180 --> 07:14.276
Oh, diary, thank you
for listening to me.

07:15.518 --> 07:16.518
Fast-forward, Beemo.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.831
Sorry, been meaning to tell you
something insanely private.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.027
But darest I?

07:20.106 --> 07:21.608
I love to...

07:21.691 --> 07:22.988
fill my bathtub full of milk

07:23.068 --> 07:24.378
and sit in it like
I'm a magic angel.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.324
There, I said it.

07:25.403 --> 07:26.325
The white of the
milk is so dense,

07:26.404 --> 07:28.049
And when I poke my little
toes out from under the milk,

07:28.073 --> 07:29.133
they startle me and I giggle.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.079
I giggle, diary.
They're my own toes,

07:30.158 --> 07:31.660
yet I giggle, and
then I fall asleep.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.471
And the milk curdles and I
get all stinky and sticky.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.042
Disgusting, diary.
Lam disgusting.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.373
I'm disgusting.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.550
I'm disgusting and I
smell like curdled milk.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.172
Anyway, back to the
Turtle Princess.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.093
Play, Beemo.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.762
So, there we are.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.384
Turtle Princess is frozen

07:44.464 --> 07:46.387
and in my little
ice wheelbarrow,

07:46.466 --> 07:48.639
and there was magic in the air.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.686
We were both feeling it.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.524
But before I can
leave the library,

07:54.599 --> 07:56.522
Finn and Jake show up!

07:56.601 --> 07:58.899
You know how Jake is.
Stretch this, stretch that.

07:58.979 --> 07:59.979
Bah!

08:00.021 --> 08:01.523
He knocks off my crown,

08:01.606 --> 08:03.779
and then Finn bonks
me on the nose!

08:03.858 --> 08:05.030
Still hurts, too.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.327
The worst part is,

08:06.403 --> 08:09.657
Turtle Princess took
away my library card.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.918
You know, dear diary,
I'm starting to worry

08:13.994 --> 08:16.747
that all these entries
sound exactly the same,

08:16.830 --> 08:19.549
and that my life is just
me running in place

08:19.624 --> 08:22.218
on some giant hamster wheel.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.921
Ugh, fast-forward, Beemo.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.816
<i>This reminds me of the time
I got stuck in my bathroom.</i>

08:26.840 --> 08:28.217
There was a squirrel.
Dan 't ask.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.259
Anyway, long story short,
imagine me crouched down

08:30.301 --> 08:32.260
on the kitchen ï¬oor talking
to the toilet paper.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.990
Ha ha! I'm like, "Who wants
to go on an adventure?

08:34.014 --> 08:35.607
Ana' the toilet
paper's //ke, "What?"

08:35.682 --> 08:37.480
You're my best friend, diary.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.277
I'm gonna take a nap.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.568
No! These tapes are important.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.318
We just don't know why yet.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.525
Beemo, fast-forward
to triple speed.

08:44.607 --> 08:45.608
Okay-

09:14.554 --> 09:16.898
Beemo, play normal speed.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.271
Come on, baby, in the pocket!

09:20.894 --> 09:22.271
I can't do it. I can't do it.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.276
Maybe he's talking
in secret code.

09:24.355 --> 09:28.201
Telling evil secrets
in secret code...

09:28.276 --> 09:29.198
He's brilliant!

09:29.277 --> 09:31.905
Well, how do we
decode the secrets?

09:31.988 --> 09:34.161
Why don't we call
others for help?

09:34.240 --> 09:35.742
Beemo, you're brilliant!

09:35.825 --> 09:37.748
Well, who do we call?

09:37.827 --> 09:40.046
Um... the smartest
person we know...

09:40.121 --> 09:41.839
Princess Bubblegum.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.885
She's brilliant.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.098
- Hi, Princess Bubblegum.
- Hey, Finn.

09:54.177 --> 09:56.179
Jake and I found a
bunch of secret tapes.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.390
We were wondering if you'd
help us decode them.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.942
- Codes?
- Yeah, they're really stupid,

10:01.017 --> 10:03.861
but, you know, maybe they're
encoded or whatevah.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.860
Oh, you called the right person.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.941
I know a lot about codes.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.697
Let's start with...

10:09.776 --> 10:11.619
- Huh?
- Oh!

10:13.363 --> 10:15.957
Hey, Princess, we
got disconnected.

10:16.032 --> 10:19.252
Hello, Finny.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.329
You sound weird.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.380
Must be a bad connection.

10:23.456 --> 10:27.051
That's why we were disconnected
earlier on the telephone.

10:27.127 --> 10:31.473
Ice King is on the
phone outside.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.926
So, how's the weather
in Candy Kingdom?

10:34.008 --> 10:35.260
Oh, the usual.

10:35.343 --> 10:38.722
There's ice everywhere, and
it smells like penguins.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.228
The only thing that smells like
penguins is you, Ice King!

10:41.307 --> 10:42.900
How did you...

10:42.976 --> 10:44.444
What are you doing?!

10:44.519 --> 10:46.567
I want to watch secret
tapes with you guys.

10:46.646 --> 10:47.442
It'll be nice.

10:47.522 --> 10:48.523
No, man.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.825
But...

10:50.900 --> 10:53.244
He doesn't know that we're
watching his tapes.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.787
We gotta find these evil secrets
