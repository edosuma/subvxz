Rupert, remember
that very expensive bottle

00:38.873 --> 00:41.932
of coconut water I got
from Pressed Juicery in Newport

00:41.950 --> 00:43.600
that we were saving
for a special occasion?

00:43.660 --> 00:45.786
Well, I'm going to need you
to get two Dixie cups

00:45.938 --> 00:47.287
and open it!

00:47.423 --> 00:49.606
I got Busy Bee
for the second week in a row!

00:49.625 --> 00:52.459
Miss Debby said that I was
the best at sharing and helping.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.461
And she didn't even have
to say that.

00:54.613 --> 00:56.463
She just had a cyst removed
from her ovary.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.965
You were right, Rupert.
I did exactly as you said.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.708
I just took it one day at a time

01:00.770 --> 01:02.895
and minded my own beeswax,
and now look.

01:03.088 --> 01:05.138
Two weeks in a row.

01:05.232 --> 01:08.550
This is good for us.
This is very good for us.

01:08.611 --> 01:10.736
I know I wasn't
originally supportive

01:10.887 --> 01:12.387
when you joined A.A.,
but I have to say,

01:12.490 --> 01:14.055
I've gotten something
out of it, too.

01:14.075 --> 01:16.391
I mean, it works when you work,
so work it.

01:16.494 --> 01:18.393
Or, y-you know,
h-however it goes.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.488
The point is,
together, we are unstoppable.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.640
I'm going for three weeks,
Rupert.

01:23.659 --> 01:25.325
Nobody's ever gotten Busy Bee
three weeks in a row before,

01:25.419 --> 01:27.811
and with you by my side,
I know I can do it.

01:27.871 --> 01:30.480
You know, you look good.
I don't tell you that enough.

01:30.499 --> 01:33.425
I want to show you
how much I appreciate you.

01:33.618 --> 01:35.986
LOIS:
Stewie, are you up there?

01:36.088 --> 01:38.246
(laughs)
Her timing, am I right?

01:38.390 --> 01:39.932
-LOIS: Stewie?
-What?

01:40.125 --> 01:41.842
Oh, there you are, sweetie.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.602
You want some animal crackers?

01:43.753 --> 01:45.753
I just went to the market
and got a new crate.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.755
Ugh, can't you ever come back
from shopping

01:47.775 --> 01:49.257
without looking like
you were getting supplies

01:49.276 --> 01:50.592
for a refugee camp?

01:50.686 --> 01:52.686
They're downstairs
if you want some.

01:52.822 --> 01:54.521
Get the hell out of here.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.174
You know what? I actually do
want some animal crackers, so...

01:57.234 --> 01:58.283
to be continued.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.119
The stuff is in the top drawer,

02:00.312 --> 02:03.122
so just, you know, get it ready.

02:10.005 --> 02:12.447
I'm going to do something
really nice for Rupert.

02:12.466 --> 02:15.192
Show him how much
he means to me, Annabelle.

02:15.252 --> 02:17.619
Oh, no, no. No, no,
I don't want you to kill anyone.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.363
-I'll let you know.
-There you are.

02:19.365 --> 02:20.697
What are you doing up here?

02:20.757 --> 02:23.049
Oh, hey, Bri.
I'm making a collage for Rupert.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.035
We've been firing
on all cylinders lately,

02:25.095 --> 02:26.979
and I just wanted
to let him know I care.

02:27.172 --> 02:28.480
That sounds stupid.

02:28.632 --> 02:29.556
Well, Annabelle
doesn't think so.

02:29.692 --> 02:31.483
Right, Annabelle?

02:31.652 --> 02:34.394
PETER:
Holy (bleep), what is that?!

02:34.488 --> 02:36.546
Wow,
look at all these old photos.

02:36.565 --> 02:38.323
Aw, I was such a cute puppy.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.900
That's not you. That's Snuffles.

02:40.052 --> 02:42.143
-He got hit by a car.
-Oh, word?

02:42.204 --> 02:43.720
You want to see
something upsetting?

02:43.780 --> 02:45.555
Look at this photo of Chris.

02:45.574 --> 02:47.908
He's, like, three years old,
and he's in a mobility scooter

02:48.043 --> 02:49.817
rolling around an oxygen tank.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.729
Wait. Is that Rupert?

02:52.748 --> 02:54.915
-Oh, yeah, I guess it is.
-What's he doing with Chris?

02:55.009 --> 02:57.509
Well, Rupert belonged to Chris
before he was yours.

02:57.661 --> 03:00.070
-Didn't you know that?
-No, I did not know that.

03:00.130 --> 03:01.346
Yeah, he was named Skippy.

03:01.539 --> 03:03.164
He had a different name?!

03:03.225 --> 03:04.850
Yeah, Skippy.
Chris took him everywhere.

03:05.001 --> 03:07.093
-Used to sleep with him, too.
-You shut up!

03:07.188 --> 03:09.095
I think he was Peter's
before that.

03:09.248 --> 03:10.689
Oh, God,
this can't be happening.

03:10.882 --> 03:12.507
I thought Rupert was mine first,

03:12.643 --> 03:16.695
not some multigenerational
family dong koozie.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.704
We need to talk,<i> Skippy.</i>

03:25.855 --> 03:27.522
That's right,
I know all about you and Chris.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.857
Ah, ah, ah, don't.
Don't run out, don't run out.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.693
Look, just sit right there,
please.

03:31.754 --> 03:33.119
I'm not angry, all right?

03:33.214 --> 03:35.121
I've j...
I've had a lot of time to think,

03:35.216 --> 03:37.549
and, well, look, I-I don't see

03:37.701 --> 03:40.052
why this has to change anything
between us.

03:40.245 --> 03:42.370
We both have a past.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.223
(high-pitched):
Hello, I'm a lady comedienne.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.783
I want to get on stage
and talk about my husband

03:46.802 --> 03:48.969
and how he leaves
the toilet seat up, et cetera.

03:49.063 --> 03:50.620
Yeah,
you don't seem like a lady.

03:50.639 --> 03:52.456
Maybe a boy or a baby
or something.

03:52.557 --> 03:53.957
I don't know,
but you're no lady.

03:53.976 --> 03:55.067
How dare you, sir!

03:55.260 --> 03:57.069
Must I show you my genitalia

03:57.262 --> 03:59.145
in order to book a gig
at this establishment?

03:59.240 --> 04:01.573
-Because I will.
-Go on. Beat it, weirdo.

04:01.766 --> 04:03.650
(regular voice): Can I
just stick around a little bit

04:03.744 --> 04:06.486
so I can go up onstage
when you guys win an Emmy?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.580
♪ ♪

04:12.920 --> 04:14.811
Uh, I guess I'll hold it.

04:14.830 --> 04:17.405
I had something memorized,
and it all dumped out.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.499
Uh, thank you to the Academy

04:19.593 --> 04:21.718
and to all the viewers
who watch.

04:26.550 --> 04:28.116
Is the light keeping you up?

04:28.185 --> 04:31.103
FYI, I'm more in love
with Michelle,

04:31.254 --> 04:32.679
if that was even possible.

04:32.831 --> 04:35.607
Oh. Oh, you know,
I still have that headache.

04:35.759 --> 04:37.667
Well, if you want to go over
to Chris's room...

04:37.728 --> 04:40.337
I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

04:40.397 --> 04:42.355
I said I wouldn't do that,
and I did it.

04:42.491 --> 04:44.866
I'm just gonna finish
this chapter.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.786
I'm trying, Rupert.

04:47.937 --> 04:49.437
I really am.
I want this to work.

04:49.456 --> 04:52.682
It's just that sometimes
I picture you in his bed, and...

04:52.701 --> 04:54.351
(breathes deeply)

04:54.411 --> 04:57.687
Anyway, big day tomorrow.
They're picking Busy Bee.

04:57.748 --> 04:59.715
I should get some sleep.

05:02.419 --> 05:04.386
(crying)

05:08.225 --> 05:09.716
I'm sorry.

05:09.852 --> 05:12.436
Nights are hard.

05:16.508 --> 05:18.317
Well...

05:19.803 --> 05:22.821
I didn't get it.
They gave Busy Bee to Frederick.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.823
Frederick!

05:24.992 --> 05:26.733
I'm not gonna hit you, so relax.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.327
Anyway, the point is

05:28.478 --> 05:30.311
it's not working anymore,
Rupert.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.664
I can't focus.
I can't concentrate.

05:32.857 --> 05:34.558
Clearly, my work is suffering.

05:34.659 --> 05:37.836
Look, we're both adults.
We can split custody of Simon.

05:38.029 --> 05:39.838
I guess I'd better tell him.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.489
-Simon?
-(beeps)

05:41.592 --> 05:44.158
You know Mommy and Daddy
love you very much.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.585
(beeps twice)

05:45.737 --> 05:47.921
But Mommy and Daddy
need some time apart.

05:48.057 --> 05:49.739
-(sustained low beep)
-Simon.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.684
Simon. Simon.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.747
Knock, knock.

05:57.808 --> 05:59.583
Stewie, can you see who's there?

05:59.643 --> 06:02.419
-What?
-Someone was knocking
at the door.

06:02.479 --> 06:04.754
It-it was me.
I just went "knock, knock."

06:04.773 --> 06:06.031
There they are again.

06:06.182 --> 06:07.090
I don't even know
how to process that,

06:07.109 --> 06:08.608
so I'm just gonna crack on.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.351
I have somebody here
that would like to see you.

06:10.454 --> 06:12.929
-Your teddy bear.
-You don't have to be coy.

06:12.989 --> 06:14.431
I know he was yours first.

06:14.491 --> 06:18.618
And, well, I want you to have...
Skippy back.

06:18.770 --> 06:21.605
-I know you're going to try
and stop me, but hear me...
-Okay.

06:21.665 --> 06:23.123
Oh. Great.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.791
Then I'll just leave him here.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.219
I hope you're both
very happy together, Chris.

06:27.412 --> 06:30.037
He belongs with you, not me.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.707
Well, I should get back
to my book.

06:32.768 --> 06:35.394
That's a clock, but okay.

06:39.257 --> 06:41.066
This is just one night, got it?

06:41.259 --> 06:42.459
Now, I'm going
to call you Rupert.

06:42.477 --> 06:43.643
You okay with that?

06:43.737 --> 06:45.462
And tomorrow,
nothing happened.

06:45.564 --> 06:47.388
By the way,
I have a Sleep Number bed.

06:47.491 --> 06:50.817
But don't worry, I don't
use it for sexual purposes.

06:50.953 --> 06:53.161
(motor whirring)

06:56.141 --> 06:57.307
What do you think of that?

06:57.367 --> 06:59.418
That something
you can work with?

07:07.118 --> 07:10.003
(yawning)

07:10.097 --> 07:12.672
Well, looks like someone
was up late.

07:12.824 --> 07:14.599
Yeah, I tend to sleep
a little longer

07:14.792 --> 07:17.677
when I'm resting under
a big, furry bear.

07:17.829 --> 07:21.665
Oh, no! They's doin'
gay jokes without me.

07:21.725 --> 07:23.850
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.111
You're part of it now.

07:30.233 --> 07:32.433
God, you're sexy.

07:32.494 --> 07:35.269
What are you looking at?!
I told you that was one night!

07:35.330 --> 07:37.289
Now get out.
I called you an Uber.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.607
I'll know if you went further
than your house.

07:40.785 --> 07:42.686
-Hey, what are you doin'?
-Oh, hey, Bri.

07:42.787 --> 07:45.446
I was just putting some product
in my hair, you know.

07:45.466 --> 07:47.874
Yeah, this looks good.
Give it a little height.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.952
Let everyone know Stewie's
back on the market.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.304
I heard that on<i> Friends.</i>

07:52.497 --> 07:54.288
Did you know
they're all 60 now?

07:54.349 --> 07:55.957
I knew Courteney Cox was.

07:56.018 --> 07:58.810
So, how you doing with Rupert
gone and everything?

07:59.003 --> 08:00.704
Are you kidding?
I'm fantastic!

08:00.764 --> 08:03.056
He was kind of holding me back,
if I'm being honest.

08:03.208 --> 08:06.651
It's time I got out there again.
I've had one bear my whole life.

08:06.803 --> 08:08.987
-That's not normal.
-Nothing about you is normal.

08:09.180 --> 08:12.157
I mean, I've already wasted a
whole year of my life with him.

08:12.326 --> 08:13.975
There's only been a year
of your life.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.994
You know, all of your responses
have been very similar,

08:16.145 --> 08:17.737
so you might want to nip that
in the bud.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.724
Look, the truth is, things got
a bit stale between us.

08:20.784 --> 08:22.984
There wasn't one part
of Rupert's body

08:23.045 --> 08:24.894
that I didn't know by heart.

08:24.955 --> 08:26.579
None of it excites me anymore.

08:26.732 --> 08:29.082
Well, do you want me to
keep an eye on Rupert for you?

08:29.176 --> 08:30.567
Make sure he's doing okay?

08:30.585 --> 08:32.402
No need.
I turned him into a nanny cam.

08:32.462 --> 08:34.996
-A nanny cam?
-Yeah, I put it inside him.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.756
Deep.
It's inside him now.

08:36.892 --> 08:39.834
I-I don't know how to respond
that won't sound similar

08:39.853 --> 08:42.412
to other responses I've made,
so just, uh, continue.

08:42.514 --> 08:44.505
Right. Well, whenever Chris
and Rupert interact,

08:44.566 --> 08:47.917
ten minutes later, I'll get a
chime notification on my phone,

08:48.019 --> 08:49.194
and I can pull up the video.

08:49.345 --> 08:50.678
Why is there a delay?

08:50.739 --> 08:52.255
Why can't you get
the video immediately?

08:52.357 --> 08:53.848
I don't know.
Why can't you poop on a toilet?

08:53.909 --> 08:55.200
-Fair.
-(phone chimes)

08:55.351 --> 08:56.609
Ah, it's chiming, it's chiming.

08:56.762 --> 08:58.278
Okay, okay, calm down,
just calm down.

08:58.372 --> 09:01.581
(breathes deeply)
Now, what do we have?

09:02.900 --> 09:06.603
Oops.
Sorry, Skippy.

09:06.663 --> 09:09.030
(gasps) Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

09:09.091 --> 09:10.957
Is Chris wearing
a nicotine patch?

09:11.109 --> 09:12.625
You know what,
it's just like I said.

09:12.719 --> 09:16.037
He and Chris go together,
like peaches and cream.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.889
Peaches.
Peaches, I'm sorry.

09:18.082 --> 09:20.450
