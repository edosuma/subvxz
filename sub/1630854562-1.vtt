WEBVTT

00:21.222 --> 00:24.058
The queen and a horse.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.760
Apparently
the king commanded it.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.261
Peasants' gossip.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.764
It is scandalous the things
being said these days.

00:29.764 --> 00:32.767
I know. But isn't it delicious?

00:56.123 --> 00:58.626
<i>How I ache for you...</i>

00:58.626 --> 01:01.495
<i>to feel your hands upon me,</i>

01:01.495 --> 01:03.464
<i>your breath on my skin.</i>

01:09.303 --> 01:12.072
<i>After what we have shared,</i>

01:12.072 --> 01:15.643
<i>how could I ever bear
the touch of my husband again?</i>

01:17.278 --> 01:21.115
<i>You are my glorious release.</i>

01:21.115 --> 01:25.453
<i>Desire has made me fearless...</i>

01:25.453 --> 01:29.557
<i>and reckless
with my reputation.</i>

01:32.493 --> 01:35.362
<i>Keep these letters safe,
my love.</i>

03:12.626 --> 03:14.261
Get down, get!

03:14.261 --> 03:16.330
Come on.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.740
Hey! Come back!

03:29.610 --> 03:32.212
- Get up, I said!
- Hey, hey!

04:32.773 --> 04:35.676
- God save the king!
- God save the king!

04:36.977 --> 04:41.882
My husband sends another man
to the Heavens to find his god.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.687
Would that he went
to such lengths to know me,

04:46.687 --> 04:49.423
<i>or his people.</i>

04:56.463 --> 04:59.333
If I could fly,
I'd have gone far from here,

04:59.333 --> 05:02.670
and I would have taken
every star I could reach.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.539
You want the stars now?

05:06.874 --> 05:09.643
I've always wanted them.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.059
Shh.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.439
<i>So I cannot give you
the stars,</i>

05:38.439 --> 05:39.873
not yet.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.078
But I can give you Paris.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.719
So, my mapmaker,

05:51.719 --> 05:53.987
take me away from here?

05:58.058 --> 06:00.661
Where do you want to go?

06:00.661 --> 06:03.063
Somewhere
we can always be together.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.104
Our bridge,
where we first kissed?

06:10.104 --> 06:11.872
Before you knew how.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.007
I had to show you, remember?

06:14.007 --> 06:16.443
I pretended
so you'd kiss me more.

06:16.443 --> 06:18.045
Liar.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.047
I taught you
everything you know.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.916
Besides, our bridge
is in the slums.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.819
Take me somewhere
where we're not poor.

06:25.819 --> 06:28.021
We'll start
at the Church of Saint-Sulpice,

06:28.021 --> 06:29.823
pray to the Blessed Mother,

06:29.823 --> 06:33.026
then to Saint-Germain...

06:33.026 --> 06:35.462
or the Tuileries.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.633
And all the way
to the mansions

06:39.633 --> 06:41.935
of Saint-HonorÃ©.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.737
Where the wolves are,

06:43.737 --> 06:46.440
in their disguise of...

06:46.440 --> 06:48.175
fine clothes,

06:48.408 --> 06:49.943
grand houses.

06:49.943 --> 06:52.880
Mm.

06:57.818 --> 07:00.621
I have a plan for us...

07:00.621 --> 07:03.423
for how we can be together.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.643
<i>Everything's a map,
isn't it?</i>

07:22.643 --> 07:25.112
<i>Every line, every scar...</i>

07:25.112 --> 07:27.014
<i>the things we've done...</i>

07:29.183 --> 07:31.618
<i>...the things we will do.</i>

07:32.886 --> 07:35.222
We're all just maps.

07:40.194 --> 07:44.965
<i>And somehow,
we find our way...</i>

07:44.965 --> 07:47.501
<i>to the things we want.</i>

08:14.261 --> 08:16.063
Marry me, Camille.

08:17.731 --> 08:20.667
Forsake all others.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.937
I cannot be without you.

08:23.937 --> 08:27.741
Have you forgotten my debt?

08:27.741 --> 08:30.577
I'll find the money.

08:30.577 --> 08:31.912
How?

08:33.881 --> 08:35.849
Mm.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.130
I love you.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.571
You can't afford me, Pascal.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.314
- Go on, then.
- <i>What?</i>

09:07.547 --> 09:09.983
I know he's all
you want to talk about.

09:11.585 --> 09:14.955
Who?

09:22.062 --> 09:24.264
He asked me to marry him.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.866
Tell me you said no.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.801
Why do you hate him so?

09:27.801 --> 09:29.970
'Cause he lets you do this.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.205
<i>Marry me.</i>

10:38.205 --> 10:40.841
- How much for you?
- No.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.376
Ooh, like to play hard to get,
do you?

10:42.376 --> 10:44.745
Come on, a whore from Jericho
should be grateful

10:44.745 --> 10:45.979
to have a man like me.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.180
I said no.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.716
Monsieur.

10:49.716 --> 10:52.386
Can't you see I'm busy?

10:52.386 --> 10:54.221
No!

10:54.221 --> 10:56.256
Come on.

11:01.928 --> 11:03.730
Thank you.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.866
It's my work
to clear the streets

11:05.866 --> 11:08.268
of immoral persons.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.971
No, it is because
you are kind, sir,

11:10.971 --> 11:12.973
a gentleman.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.199
Ah...

12:27.147 --> 12:29.449
Camille.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.451
<i>Creeping like a mouse.</i>

12:31.451 --> 12:34.454
I hope your pockets
are full of coins.

12:34.454 --> 12:37.224
Fuck some men, Camille.
Make me money.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.993
- I'll do better tomorrow.
- Oh, you will.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.496
Or I will bring the men
to you myself.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.966
<i>Good night, Madame Jericho.</i>

12:45.966 --> 12:48.268
<i>Good night, gentlemen.</i>

12:52.506 --> 12:54.975
I can't do it anymore.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.010
I can't have them touch me.

13:03.517 --> 13:06.953
We'll manage.
We will get out of here.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.923
I'm going to marry him.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.025
I want my life with Pascal.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.195
Victoire, don't sulk.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.164
No, no, this is wonderful.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.533
I love miracles.
So he has money now?

13:19.533 --> 13:20.901
He'll pay your debt
from Jericho,

13:20.901 --> 13:23.503
and you'll run into his arms
as a free woman?

13:23.503 --> 13:25.105
Bravo, Pascal.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.506
<i>You know he has no money.</i>

13:26.506 --> 13:28.041
Then how, Camille?

13:28.041 --> 13:29.509
<i>You can't trust him.</i>

13:29.509 --> 13:31.178
And love won't get you
out of here.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.013
Only this will.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.982
Remind me, how many years
have you been here?

13:35.982 --> 13:38.852
<i>Because the story that I heard
was that Jericho plucked you</i>

13:38.852 --> 13:40.253
from a crab pot

13:40.253 --> 13:42.088
on the banks of the river
when you were just a child.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.591
So I hope you don't mind
if I put my faith in love.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.293
Go.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.994
I hope
you'll be happy together.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.363
- We will be.
- With no need of me.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.431
I am glad.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.300
I'll finally have a bed
to myself.

13:53.300 --> 13:56.169
And I was not in a pot.
I was mending them.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.371
And they were lobsters,
not crabs.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.540
Of course.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.842
So much more glamorous.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.416
Now, will you stop sulking
and come here?

14:11.017 --> 14:13.920
We are getting out of here.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.255
We.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.494
I know what it is
to be abandoned.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.565
I will never leave you.

14:48.922 --> 14:53.593
To whom do we owe
tonight's apartment, Valmont?

14:53.593 --> 14:55.228
<i>The wife of a minister.</i>

14:55.228 --> 14:58.465
Your visit is
quite above suspicion.

14:59.966 --> 15:02.168
If she were here.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.638
Well, then I couldn't do this.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.477
Or this.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.118
Valmont...

15:18.118 --> 15:21.454
tell me I am your only lover.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.490
The only one.

15:25.091 --> 15:28.461
Then give me back my letters.

15:30.230 --> 15:33.266
<i>You will not destroy me, Valmont.</i>

15:33.266 --> 15:35.302
<i>Of course not, my love,</i>

15:35.302 --> 15:37.370
<i>because I will have my title</i>

15:37.370 --> 15:39.439
<i>and you will have
your letters.</i>

15:49.949 --> 15:51.251
Give them to me.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.586
The letters were not there,
Madame de Merteuil.

16:13.206 --> 16:16.476
Clean up this place, Azolan.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.346
Find us something
other than bread to eat.

16:19.346 --> 16:22.582
I would be glad to,
sir, but we've no money.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.185
That will soon change.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.187
Didn't I promise you
the brightest future

16:27.187 --> 16:28.988
when I took you on here?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.323
You did...

16:30.323 --> 16:32.692
though it still
remains too bright to see

16:32.692 --> 16:34.194
with the human eye.

16:44.070 --> 16:47.340
Why do you fuss so much
about those wretched cats?

16:47.340 --> 16:49.109
Because they were
your mother's.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.443
I know you love them, sir.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.379
Well, they're the insult
of my inheritance.

16:52.379 --> 16:53.747
They're there
to remind me of...

16:53.747 --> 16:55.415
Everything I don't have.

16:57.784 --> 17:01.421
It is depressing
to be so underestimated.

17:01.421 --> 17:05.692
As if I'd keep her letters here
in this pit.

17:05.692 --> 17:09.229
What will you do now that madame
will not give you a title?

17:09.229 --> 17:11.531
It was her first move...

17:11.531 --> 17:14.434
a bluff in a game
that I must win.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.704
Perhaps she needs reminding
of the words she's written.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.373
Her husband has one
of the oldest titles in France

17:20.373 --> 17:23.410
and all the power
that comes with it.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.412
I think when she sees
her letters again,

17:25.412 --> 17:27.147
she won't risk her marriage.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.450
I liked her.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.354
She used to give me oranges.

17:42.695 --> 17:46.466
I think the days of oranges
may be behind us.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.829
You have something for me?

18:21.167 --> 18:22.602
And my money?

18:22.602 --> 18:25.705
I find myself in somewhat
reduced circumstances, Emile.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.340
That's not my concern.

18:27.340 --> 18:30.410
A line of credit,
between us, perhaps.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.878
Until the end of the week.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.646
You think it's easy
to get you these apartments

18:33.646 --> 18:35.482
at a moment's notice?

18:35.482 --> 18:37.383
What do you think
would happen to me

18:37.383 --> 18:41.154
if a client found I'd lent out
their place when they're away?

18:41.154 --> 18:43.556
I think
they'd be appalled, Emile.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.358
<i>It shows poor character--</i>

18:45.358 --> 18:48.528
a desire for personal gain
over trust, tut-tut.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.533
For the vault.

18:54.734 --> 18:58.838
And the rent's double,
or find someone else.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.530
They want you on the Ile.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.698
<i>They found your river tunnel.</i>

19:25.698 --> 19:27.333
Mm.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.203
Why must we map
these godforsaken slums?

19:30.203 --> 19:31.905
All of Paris is to be mapped,

19:31.905 --> 19:34.908
every inch and all the people in it
by orders of the king.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.544
Don't you know
we're a city out of control?

19:37.544 --> 19:39.312
Chaos is to be fit.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.880
Now, if you excuse me, gentlemen.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.483
I have a prior engagement.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.721
- Need my light, sir?
- Oh, I know my way.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.726
Ah...

19:53.726 --> 19:55.361
ah...

19:55.361 --> 19:56.396
A.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.433
I could make you happy, sir.

20:02.602 --> 20:05.838
Ah, back again, monsieur.
You should be careful.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.907
My lady will think
it means something.

20:07.907 --> 20:11.344
Take a lover of your own,
Victoire, male or female.

20:11.344 --> 20:14.647
I hope you have money.
My lady costs.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.849
Take a lover, Victoire.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.767
My answer is yes.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.306
Camille.

21:16.009 --> 21:17.844
<i>Camille.</i>

21:20.713 --> 21:24.550
Your timing,
as ever, is wretched.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.653
<i>Camille, Jericho wants money.</i>

21:30.490 --> 21:32.291
Tell her I'll work tomorrow.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.860
She knows he's with you.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.329
She wants payment
for the night.

21:36.329 --> 21:38.531
I told you, my lady costs.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.667
Children,
may we not have one night

21:40.667 --> 21:43.436
where you two don't squabble
amongst one another?

21:43.436 --> 21:45.438
To friendship and love.

21:45.438 --> 21:47.640
<i>I know what it took
to buy that wine.</i>

21:47.640 --> 21:49.542
It wasn't love.

21:51.944 --> 21:55.381
- Where's the money?
- It's in my bag.

21:55.381 --> 21:58.618
This night will clearly cost me everything.

22:56.576 --> 23:00.012
"I am obsessed
with the memory of you."

23:00.012 --> 23:03.716
Pascal, I don't understand.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.653
Give it to me. Please, my love.

23:07.653 --> 23:10.790
"To be made so alive
by you, your kiss,

23:10.790 --> 23:14.761
your touch, your body
means to be dead without you."

23:14.761 --> 23:16.929
It's just a letter.
It's just words.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.998
Who is she?

23:18.998 --> 23:21.667
GeneviÃ¨ve de Merteuil.
I'm sorry.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.469
- I'm--
- Don't touch me.

23:23.469 --> 23:25.538
Oh, for you to be so righteous.

23:25.538 --> 23:26.973
I never lied about who I am.

23:26.973 --> 23:29.442
You never told me who you are.
You give nothing of your life.

23:29.442 --> 23:31.811
Everything I am is here!

23:34.480 --> 23:37.116
For you to procure!

23:37.116 --> 23:39.118
<i>To be such a fool</i>

23:39.118 --> 23:40.620
to believe in you,
to wait for you,

23:40.620 --> 23:41.988
while all the time,
she's waiting, too.

23:41.988 --> 23:44.123
- It's not the same.
<i>- Does she know that?</i>

23:44.123 --> 23:45.958
I have her secrets.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.628
S-she will do anything
to protect them.

23:48.628 --> 23:51.631
She'll give me anything,
whatever I want.

23:51.631 --> 23:54.667
Strange,
I thought you wanted me.

23:59.672 --> 24:01.140
This letter,

24:01.140 --> 24:04.977
I drew it from her for us.

24:06.512 --> 24:10.116
A wife can ruin her husband
with her actions.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.851
So she's married.

24:13.085 --> 24:15.488
You reveal yourself
with every minute.

24:15.488 --> 24:19.225
She will do or pay anything
to save her reputation,

24:19.458 --> 24:20.793
her husband's name.

24:20.793 --> 24:24.197
You would destroy a woman
by blackmail.

24:25.698 --> 24:29.235
Not my mapmaker after all.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.039
Just another whore.

24:41.147 --> 24:43.182
Then how do we live?

24:43.182 --> 24:45.585
Hmm?

24:45.585 --> 24:48.955
Oh, I have no fortune coming.
My stepmother's seen to that.

24:48.955 --> 24:51.190
And you have nothing.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.229
Do not be naive, Camille.

24:59.632 --> 25:02.568
How else do you think
we will have our freedom...

25:04.070 --> 25:06.505
- ...our love?
- You don't know how to love.

25:06.505 --> 25:10.209
My love for you is
the only thing I am sure of.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.819
Beyond secrets, beyond money.

25:19.819 --> 25:21.954
Beyond everything.

25:21.954 --> 25:23.789
Then stop this.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.793
You must stop this.

25:27.793 --> 25:30.630
I won't be betrayed by you.

25:30.630 --> 25:33.866
I won't be weak because of you.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.801
Do you understand?

25:37.103 --> 25:39.038
It's either love or war.

25:39.038 --> 25:42.642
There is nothing
in between, nothing.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.646
It is love.

25:59.759 --> 26:01.327
<i>I will burn them all.</i>

26:02.895 --> 26:04.931
"All"?

26:04.931 --> 26:08.100
She has written to me before.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.770
I keep them only
to execute this plan.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.972
Where, by your bedside?

26:12.972 --> 26:16.676
- There's no sentiment to them.
- But you read them?

26:16.676 --> 26:17.910
No more than I look

26:17.910 --> 26:20.780
at the plans of Versailles
they're stuffed beneath.

26:22.782 --> 26:24.984
<i>They are my security.</i>

26:24.984 --> 26:28.321
I don't seek to destroy her.

26:28.321 --> 26:32.258
I want a better life
for both of us.

26:32.258 --> 26:34.293
<i>Come away with me.</i>

26:34.293 --> 26:37.697
<i>How? Words are easy.</i>

26:37.697 --> 26:39.332
<i>Then let me prove it.</i>

26:39.332 --> 26:42.134
You think Jericho
will simply let me go?

26:42.134 --> 26:44.737
Jericho won't matter.

26:46.739 --> 26:51.010
I'll come to our bridge
at ten tomorrow night,

26:51.010 --> 26:54.080
and all you need to do
is be there, too.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.983
And we'll go far from here...

26:56.983 --> 26:59.652
and we'll start again.

27:04.991 --> 27:07.827
All I want is you.

29:00.005 --> 29:01.307
<i>No more than I look</i>

29:01.307 --> 29:04.410
<i>at the plans of Versailles
they're stuffed beneath.</i>

29:25.364 --> 29:27.800
Uh, what are you doing here?

29:27.800 --> 29:28.834
Hey!

29:36.976 --> 29:38.377
<i>Stop that boy!</i>

29:38.377 --> 29:39.812
Stop him!

29:39.812 --> 29:41.514
Imbecile!

29:49.488 --> 29:51.957
<i>A letter's come for you.</i>

29:51.957 --> 29:54.994
<i>And it's not
Madame de Merteuil's hand, sir.</i>

30:03.335 --> 30:05.938
<i>Where are you,
my wicked pussycat?</i>

30:05.938 --> 30:10.176
<i>Your Florence's thighs
are lonely without you.</i>

30:10.176 --> 30:12.545
No more bloody letters.

30:12.545 --> 30:15.848
We're done
with letters, Azolan.

30:15.848 --> 30:17.316
Put it on the fire.

30:22.121 --> 30:23.222
<i>I must go and see my wretch...</i>

30:23.222 --> 30:25.024
<i>...of a stepmother.</i>

30:30.029 --> 30:32.131
<i>Are you not going
to tell me</i>

30:32.131 --> 30:35.201
<i>how little I've changed
in the years since last you came?</i>

30:37.903 --> 30:40.606
Grief slows the passing
of time.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.042
It keeps one
a prisoner of sorts,

30:43.042 --> 30:45.511
yet acts
as a remarkable elixir.

30:45.511 --> 30:49.281
Well, you're not such a prisoner
in the evenings, huh?

30:49.281 --> 30:52.084
When you dance and dine your way
along the Champs Elysees,

30:52.084 --> 30:53.986
well, you're not grieving then,

30:53.986 --> 30:55.921
nor when you parade
through all the doors

30:55.921 --> 30:57.056
<i>my father opened for you.</i>

30:57.056 --> 30:59.358
So not quite bygones
being bygones.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.460
My request is small enough...

31:01.460 --> 31:05.064
a settlement,
once and for all...

31:05.064 --> 31:09.335
enough for me to buy a piece of land
somewhere in the south.

31:09.335 --> 31:11.270
I'll go from Paris.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.874
I do believe you are in love.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.179
What else could cause you

31:20.179 --> 31:21.880
to lower your sights
on my fortune?

31:21.880 --> 31:22.982
My father's fortune.

31:22.982 --> 31:25.517
- Your mother was a spendthrift, too.
- Do not speak of her.

31:25.517 --> 31:28.520
Your father would tear out
what little hair he had left

31:28.520 --> 31:30.489
as she gave
to every pauper in town.

31:30.489 --> 31:34.260
- Give me something.
- Some advice, then.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.996
Give your soul to God.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.464
Trust in the divine.

31:38.464 --> 31:41.200
<i>Let your faith be
your sustenance.</i>

31:42.668 --> 31:44.169
You don't need to thank me.

31:44.169 --> 31:47.106
All of this--my father's title,
his fortune--

31:47.106 --> 31:49.575
should have been mine when he died,
but you poisoned him against me.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.977
It's not my fault
he fell in love with me.

31:51.977 --> 31:54.546
- Let's call it by its name.
- And I earned it...

31:54.546 --> 31:57.016
every piece of it.

31:57.016 --> 31:59.084
He was a man of great appetite.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.153
I have nothing, Ondine.

32:03.389 --> 32:06.425
I am destitute but for
the pitiful wage that I earn.

32:06.425 --> 32:09.361
<i>- Give me what is mine.</i>
- But I can't.

32:09.361 --> 32:12.298
You see, all this...

32:12.298 --> 32:16.035
vast, vast fortune...

32:16.035 --> 32:18.237
it's for my son.

32:18.237 --> 32:21.173
Your father loved him
as if he were his own.

32:23.208 --> 32:25.678
More, perhaps.

32:53.539 --> 32:56.508
You know your debt to Jericho.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.410
I know, Victoire.

32:58.410 --> 33:01.347
I count it in the sweat
of every man who comes to me.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.749
But if I work
every hour of every day,

33:03.982 --> 33:06.485
I still won't clear it
in my lifetime.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.187
Eat some bread.

33:08.187 --> 33:12.191
She'd rather see you dead
than let you go.

33:14.626 --> 33:18.130
Which is why we cannot make
a mistake tonight.

33:18.130 --> 33:21.200
Under the old bridge,
ten o'clock.

33:23.202 --> 33:25.371
You can't trust him.

33:25.371 --> 33:27.139
I have to.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.390
<i>Send them away, Azolan.</i>

33:44.390 --> 33:45.791
<i>We have to leave.</i>

33:51.296 --> 33:52.564
Sir.

33:59.605 --> 34:01.573
<i>I sent for you, pussycat,</i>

34:01.573 --> 34:04.410
<i>but you have abandoned me.</i>

34:04.410 --> 34:07.579
<i>I have a gift waiting for you.</i>

34:11.784 --> 34:14.086
Shall I put it
on the fire, sir?

34:20.526 --> 34:23.829
- Going somewhere?
- <i>To the opera.</i>

34:24.062 --> 34:25.597
Save yourself a walk.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.766
I have a gentleman for you.

34:38.644 --> 34:40.646
<i>Thank you.</i>

34:44.650 --> 34:46.652
What did you pay for?

34:49.254 --> 34:50.556
You.

34:57.296 --> 35:00.365
Shall I send for wine?
Some food, perhaps?

35:00.365 --> 35:03.469
Where, against the wall,
on the bed?

35:03.469 --> 35:05.471
What do you want?

35:05.471 --> 35:07.840
You've paid for me.
Let's get it done.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.642
No, you misunderstand me, Camille.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.646
How do you know my name?

35:14.646 --> 35:17.850
I've made it my business
to know all about you.

35:22.488 --> 35:26.124
I know you've been in this
godforsaken place four years.

35:28.126 --> 35:31.163
I know you are a prize here...

35:31.163 --> 35:33.232
<i>not like the others.</i>

35:33.232 --> 35:36.502
And we have met before.

35:36.502 --> 35:38.337
Do you not recall?

35:40.506 --> 35:42.641
I have good prospects.

35:42.641 --> 35:46.712
I'm an officer with
the Unit of Moral Discipline.

35:46.712 --> 35:49.214
- Monsieur.
- Call me Gabriel.

35:53.452 --> 35:55.387
What are you doing?

35:55.387 --> 35:58.190
It's your money back, monsieur.

35:58.190 --> 36:00.526
I have to go.
I have to be somewhere.

36:07.432 --> 36:09.568
I am not an insignificant man, demoiselle.

36:09.568 --> 36:11.870
I'm better than the filth
that comes to you,

36:11.870 --> 36:13.639
yet you insult me.

36:13.639 --> 36:15.541
I will not spend
the night with you.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.643
You will stay.
I've paid for you.

36:19.878 --> 36:23.382
Get away from her.
Move, now, slow.

36:23.382 --> 36:25.450
To the window.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.327
I will cut your throat.

36:35.327 --> 36:37.262
<i>Outside.</i>

36:43.368 --> 36:44.937
- Camille?
- Rose, let us pass.

36:44.937 --> 36:46.672
Where are you going?

36:46.672 --> 36:49.541
- To Pascal Valmont?
- I'm sorry.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.710
- What will you give me?
- I have nothing.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.815
Rose, please.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.938
Oi!

37:58.944 --> 38:02.014
Something must have
happened, an accident.

38:02.014 --> 38:05.917
- There's no accident.
- Victoire, enough!

38:05.917 --> 38:07.986
<i>You have to change
how you feel about him</i>

38:07.986 --> 38:09.855
if we're to live together.

38:16.028 --> 38:19.031
You said you had
something for me.

38:19.031 --> 38:21.500
Something...

38:21.500 --> 38:22.701
very special.

38:25.003 --> 38:28.006
A trinket...

38:28.006 --> 38:30.609
for my trinket.

38:40.919 --> 38:44.356
There are more letters...
more women.

38:48.727 --> 38:51.063
All to him,
all from other women.

38:51.063 --> 38:52.464
All write of love.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.704
Read them, Camille.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.639
You'll never cry for him again.

39:04.710 --> 39:07.379
<i>Aren't you tired
of borrowed apartments?</i>

39:11.083 --> 39:12.718
We must have a place.

39:12.718 --> 39:14.553
With two keys...

39:15.987 --> 39:17.789
...one for me

39:17.789 --> 39:20.926
and one for you, my pussycat.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.928
Make it real.

39:25.731 --> 39:27.599
Give me funds tonight,

39:27.599 --> 39:31.603
and I will secure a nest
for us in the morning.

39:31.603 --> 39:35.107
No more...

39:35.107 --> 39:36.408
talking.

40:16.481 --> 40:18.483
<i>Who is she?</i>

40:18.483 --> 40:20.552
<i>GeneviÃ¨ve de Merteuil.</i>

40:29.528 --> 40:31.630
Come, we're going.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.965
Where?

40:46.611 --> 40:49.181
We wish to see
Madame de Merteuil.

40:49.181 --> 40:51.750
Madame helps the poor
through the church.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.718
I suggest you try there.

40:53.718 --> 40:55.687
Tell her
I have news of Valmont.

41:30.589 --> 41:32.791
What could you possibly know
of Valmont?

41:32.791 --> 41:34.659
Throw these creatures out, Majordome.

41:34.659 --> 41:36.261
We have his letters.

42:06.091 --> 42:08.193
Let us be done. How much
do you want for this letter?

42:08.193 --> 42:10.595
I'm not a blackmailer, madame.

42:10.595 --> 42:12.831
Liar.

42:12.831 --> 42:14.866
I do not believe
that women should fall

42:14.866 --> 42:18.303
while men survive
the same indiscretions.

42:18.536 --> 42:20.305
I'm here to offer you
your freedom.

42:22.674 --> 42:26.711
You, offer me my freedom,
from what?

42:26.711 --> 42:30.782
Giving your heart to a man
who does not know how to love.

42:30.782 --> 42:33.285
Get out of my house.

42:33.285 --> 42:35.020
"Your body against mine.

42:35.020 --> 42:38.223
Your strong hands lifting me,
moving me."

42:38.223 --> 42:40.558
Shall I go on?

42:40.558 --> 42:42.661
There are other letters, madame.

42:42.661 --> 42:43.728
Where?

42:43.728 --> 42:45.330
<i>In a place of safety.</i>

42:46.831 --> 42:49.167
Valmont has put you up to this.

42:49.167 --> 42:51.269
I do nothing for Valmont.

42:51.269 --> 42:53.838
I don't believe you.

42:53.838 --> 42:56.708
I see the flush in your cheeks

42:56.708 --> 42:58.977
when you speak his name.

42:58.977 --> 43:01.079
If there is a flush,
then it is anger

43:01.079 --> 43:04.149
at having made myself
so vulnerable in loving him.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.819
Valmont is dead to me.

43:13.591 --> 43:16.795
Can you eat those,
or are they ornamental?

43:21.766 --> 43:24.636
So...

43:24.636 --> 43:27.806
...my rival is a girl
from the slums.

43:29.140 --> 43:31.977
We are only rivals
if we still desire him.

43:33.345 --> 43:35.280
What do you want from me?

43:37.115 --> 43:39.951
Valmont has put me
at great risk.

43:39.951 --> 43:42.320
I cannot go back
to my old life.

43:42.320 --> 43:46.224
I ask again, what do you want?

43:48.026 --> 43:49.828
I don't want
to be betrayed again.

43:49.828 --> 43:53.164
Do not seek
that counsel from me.

43:55.700 --> 43:59.037
I have not always been
in the slums, madame.

43:59.037 --> 44:01.873
I have been
in a great house before.

44:01.873 --> 44:03.675
I have seen wealth and power.

44:03.675 --> 44:05.844
I have seen what it can do,

44:05.844 --> 44:08.813
how it can protect.

44:08.813 --> 44:11.216
I want to learn that privilege.

44:11.216 --> 44:13.651
Privilege cannot be learned.

44:13.651 --> 44:15.720
All things can be learned.

44:16.955 --> 44:19.024
Teach me...

44:19.024 --> 44:22.093
and I will give you back
every one of your letters.

44:22.093 --> 44:25.730
<i>Your marriage will be saved.
You will be free.</i>

44:25.730 --> 44:28.366
You clearly know nothing
of marriage.

44:39.010 --> 44:41.780
Take this off.
You will catch your death.

44:47.986 --> 44:50.021
Excuse me!

44:50.021 --> 44:52.023
I need to see Camille.

44:52.023 --> 44:54.192
I was to meet her. I was late.

44:54.192 --> 44:57.062
She's gone, sir.
She ran out on all of us.

44:57.062 --> 44:59.931
Jericho will find her.
She'll be done for then.

44:59.931 --> 45:01.399
Poor cow.

45:30.428 --> 45:33.064
There is news
from a plantation.

45:33.064 --> 45:36.734
Your husband, the marquis,
has left Saint-Domingue.

45:36.734 --> 45:39.270
He will return
before the month is out.

45:42.440 --> 45:46.144
I find myself much burdened.

45:52.050 --> 45:54.452
I...I brought the cards.

45:54.452 --> 45:56.454
I thought they might provide
a welcome distraction.

45:57.956 --> 46:01.092
It's a miracle I need now.

46:01.092 --> 46:02.994
Or a good friend.

46:12.170 --> 46:14.539
Ah, you are from the slums,

46:14.772 --> 46:18.810
and yet your hands
are not worn or calloused.

46:18.810 --> 46:21.346
They encouraged me
to keep them soft.

46:22.547 --> 46:26.284
I will not ask why,
though I can guess.

46:26.284 --> 46:28.119
So...

46:28.119 --> 46:32.190
you, perhaps,
I can invent a history for.

46:32.190 --> 46:35.860
The daughter of a friend
from the country, new to Paris.

46:35.860 --> 46:38.863
But this creature...

46:40.899 --> 46:42.834
...that's not possible.

46:42.834 --> 46:45.837
One transformation
will be challenge enough.

46:45.837 --> 46:48.406
- She must go.
- She's in my care. She stays.

46:48.406 --> 46:50.909
There are other letters, madame.

46:54.245 --> 46:55.980
Then she must be mute.

46:55.980 --> 46:59.817
<i>Your deaf and silent maid</i>

46:59.817 --> 47:02.053
from... Marseille.

47:02.053 --> 47:04.556
- I will not be silent.
- You will.

47:04.556 --> 47:06.591
Then I will not be
from Marseille--

47:06.824 --> 47:09.060
thieves and liars, all of them.

47:09.060 --> 47:11.029
Thus your provenance.

47:11.029 --> 47:13.364
There's work to do.

47:14.566 --> 47:16.334
Marseille?

47:18.836 --> 47:20.338
Read.

47:20.338 --> 47:23.408
It will help your conversation
at the very least.

47:23.408 --> 47:25.276
I've nothing with pictures,
I'm afraid.

47:25.276 --> 47:26.578
I read.

47:28.947 --> 47:30.215
Though, in Paris,

47:30.215 --> 47:33.051
it doesn't matter
how well-read one is

47:33.051 --> 47:35.420
<i>if one is not appealing
to the eye.</i>

47:44.495 --> 47:48.233
He made us love him
by anticipating our needs

47:48.233 --> 47:50.101
and playing to them.

47:55.473 --> 47:57.275
What did you need?

48:00.278 --> 48:01.946
To forget.

48:04.015 --> 48:07.418
To be lost in someone
so full of fire,

48:07.418 --> 48:11.122
it burned away everything
that went before.

48:13.124 --> 48:15.293
How many lovers did he have?

48:16.661 --> 48:18.930
You may tell me.

48:18.930 --> 48:21.933
I will not break.

48:21.933 --> 48:24.135
Um, I might.

48:28.006 --> 48:30.975
Then we must pile up your hair

48:30.975 --> 48:33.144
and bind you in silk...

48:35.413 --> 48:38.316
...so your broken heart
does not show.

48:40.084 --> 48:41.519
<i>Ah, Madame Berthe,</i>

48:41.519 --> 48:45.123
we will need a full wardrobe
for the season

48:45.123 --> 48:47.625
for Camille...

48:49.127 --> 48:51.362
...the daughter
of a dear friend.

48:51.362 --> 48:55.333
It is a pleasure
always to help you, madame.

49:21.292 --> 49:23.995
What rags are these?

49:26.998 --> 49:30.068
Fresh ribbons, madame.
Berthe, I will choose.

49:47.151 --> 49:48.753
White...

49:50.555 --> 49:52.357
...like the chameleon.

50:40.671 --> 50:42.673
Ah! Bah-bah-bah.

50:53.551 --> 50:55.753
He does not deserve your pain.

50:57.221 --> 51:01.225
- I loved him.
- Love is lethal, Camille.

51:02.627 --> 51:07.098
Explore your own heart,
but study the hearts of others.

51:07.098 --> 51:09.233
Trust me when I tell you

51:09.233 --> 51:11.536
your lover...

51:11.536 --> 51:13.337
is your future enemy.

51:21.212 --> 51:23.781
Men think
they pluck us, Camille,

51:23.781 --> 51:28.152
when we are ripe
and at our sweetest.

51:29.620 --> 51:33.858
Our skill is
in letting them believe that.

51:36.627 --> 51:41.232
That privilege you spoke of...

51:41.232 --> 51:43.668
wealth and power...

51:45.436 --> 51:47.638
...I wanted it, too.

51:47.638 --> 51:50.575
But marriage without love...

51:50.575 --> 51:52.176
...is a prison.

51:53.478 --> 51:58.249
I managed mine
with painstaking effort.

51:58.249 --> 52:00.852
I perfected a faÃ§ade...

52:02.353 --> 52:04.155
...never allowing the truth

52:04.155 --> 52:07.358
of what I thought
or felt to show.

52:08.759 --> 52:10.495
And...

52:12.630 --> 52:15.333
...piece by piece,

52:15.333 --> 52:17.768
secret by secret...

52:20.171 --> 52:23.474
...I escaped the confines
of my marriage...

52:25.776 --> 52:27.612
<i>...built a wall
around my heart</i>

52:27.612 --> 52:31.749
for a life that was mine...

52:31.749 --> 52:34.352
completely...

52:34.352 --> 52:35.686
<i>life where I could have</i>

52:35.686 --> 52:38.723
<i>all that I wanted
without consequence.</i>

52:40.224 --> 52:43.694
My one mistake was Valmont.

52:43.694 --> 52:48.533
<i>I allowed the truth of what
I thought and felt to show.</i>

52:49.700 --> 52:52.236
Worse, I wrote it down.

52:59.810 --> 53:01.812
Your pain shows.

53:01.812 --> 53:03.714
Good.

53:03.714 --> 53:06.217
Then I'll always remember.

53:06.217 --> 53:07.919
What?

53:07.919 --> 53:10.421
What I would otherwise choose
to forget.

53:10.421 --> 53:12.657
No, you must learn to hide it,

53:12.657 --> 53:15.526
because I believe
you can survive in this world

53:15.526 --> 53:18.429
where men have all the power
and we have none.

53:21.399 --> 53:23.434
Hide your pain...

53:24.936 --> 53:28.406
...and close your heart to love
and the ruin it threatens.

53:29.774 --> 53:33.210
With you,
the tide might change.

53:33.210 --> 53:35.446
And what I began...

53:37.548 --> 53:39.550
...you may finish.

53:46.557 --> 53:48.659
Are you ready?

54:08.245 --> 54:10.247
Where have you been, my love?

54:10.247 --> 54:13.351
I've been searching
for your title.

54:13.351 --> 54:16.621
But it is not vicomte.

54:16.621 --> 54:19.957
It is not marquis,

54:19.957 --> 54:21.892
nor duke.

54:21.892 --> 54:24.762
Well, I can hardly bear
the anticipation,

54:24.762 --> 54:28.332
though baron would feel
entirely underwhelming.

54:30.701 --> 54:33.971
It is...

54:33.971 --> 54:36.974
blackmailer.

54:36.974 --> 54:39.310
And I have only to call it out,

54:39.310 --> 54:43.314
and it is you who will be dead
to this society.

54:47.418 --> 54:51.322
And I have only to send
one letter to your husband.

54:53.958 --> 54:55.993
One letter.

54:55.993 --> 54:57.862
Then send it, Valmont...

54:59.463 --> 55:00.998
...if you have it.

55:05.369 --> 55:06.671
Hmm.

55:24.522 --> 55:26.023
Welcome...

55:26.023 --> 55:28.859
to the opera, Camille.

56:23.447 --> 56:25.883
<i>She is Babel...</i>

56:25.883 --> 56:28.452
<i>...the very danger
that it is my work to stop,</i>

56:28.452 --> 56:31.122
<i>and here I am, bewitched.</i>

56:32.957 --> 56:35.793
Therefore,
evil shall come upon thee.

56:37.628 --> 56:40.798
Thou shalt not know
from whence it rises.

56:40.798 --> 56:43.934
Do you mean evil shall
come upon you...

56:43.934 --> 56:45.669
or upon her?

56:47.738 --> 56:49.106
Perhaps us both.
