00:19.967 --> 00:23.000
LOOK AT ME.
SATURDAY NIGHT HOME ALONE.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.233
TV: NEXT ON THE FOOD CHANNEL...

00:25.233 --> 00:26.400
YUMMY CHEWY BROWNIES.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.734
I SHOULD BE DATING
COLLEGE GIRLS, BUT I'M NOT.

00:28.734 --> 00:30.500
TV: AND THIS JUST IN
TO THE WEATHER CHANNEL...

00:30.500 --> 00:34.500
HURRICANE CHESTER
HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED
FROM A STAGE 4 HURRICANE

00:34.500 --> 00:36.200
TO A REFRESHING BREEZE.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.367
I WANT TO DATE
COLLEGE GIRLS, BUT HOW?

00:38.367 --> 00:39.900
HOW, I ASK?

00:39.900 --> 00:41.700
TV: MTV's<i>SINGLED OUT</i>
<i>IS COMING TO PHILADELPHIA.</i>

00:41.700 --> 00:43.000
IF YOU WANT TO BE
A CONTESTANT

00:43.000 --> 00:44.667
AND MEET HUNDREDS
OF COLLEGE GIRLS

00:44.667 --> 00:47.834
ON A VERY SPECIAL
COLLEGE EDITION
OF<i>SINGLED OUT,</i>

00:47.834 --> 00:49.867
THEN CALL THE NUMBER
ON YOUR SCREEN.

00:49.867 --> 00:52.667
TO GIVE YOUR BROWNIES
EVEN MORE CHEWINESS...

00:52.667 --> 00:53.700
WAIT A MINUTE.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.967
TO MEET THOUSANDS
OF COLLEGE GIRLS,

00:55.967 --> 00:57.500
HERE'S THAT NUMBER AGAIN.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.767
SEE YOU ON
<i>SINGLED OUT.</i>

00:59.767 --> 01:01.200
YES, YOU WILL.

01:06.033 --> 01:08.567
A TONSILLECTOMY
IS A REALLY SIMPLE OPERATION.

01:08.567 --> 01:10.567
YEAH. YOU STAY OVERNIGHT
IN THE HOSPITAL,

01:10.567 --> 01:12.900
YOU EAT JELL-O,
AND YOU COME HOME
THE NEXT DAY.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.300
[HOARSELY]
I DON'T NEED
AN OPERATION.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.233
THEN WHY ARE YOU
TALKING LIKE THAT?

01:16.233 --> 01:19.467
I JUST IRRITATED MY TONSILS
BRUSHING MY TEETH.

01:19.467 --> 01:21.800
IT'S THAT DARN
ANGLE TOOTHBRUSH.

01:21.800 --> 01:24.200
TELL YOUR FRIEND HE HAS
TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.967
I'M SORRY.
I GOT SOME SERIOUS
PROBLEMS WITH DOCTORS,

01:25.967 --> 01:28.300
AND I DON'T THINK
I HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY.

01:28.300 --> 01:29.467
EXPLAIN WHY.

01:29.467 --> 01:31.400
LAST NIGHT I'M FLIPPING
THROUGH CHANNELS.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.934
I'M WATCHING CNN.

01:32.934 --> 01:34.200
WATCHING CNN?

01:34.200 --> 01:36.600
YEAH. THEY SUCKERED ME IN
WITH THIS STORY ABOUT CAKE,

01:36.600 --> 01:38.967
THEN THEY DID AN EXPOSÃ©
ON A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY

01:38.967 --> 01:41.767
WHO WENT TO THE HOSPITAL
ON A ROUTINE PROCEDURE...

01:41.767 --> 01:42.600
AND VANISHED.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.600
VANISHED? I WANT
A SECOND OPINION.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.700
CORY, YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT HERE.

01:47.700 --> 01:48.867
CAKE!

01:48.867 --> 01:51.367
SHAWN, GO HOME.
YOU'RE SCARING MY SON.

01:51.367 --> 01:55.500
I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S
MY DUTY TO STAY
AND PROTECT MY FRIEND.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.600
AND I AM PROTECTING CORY
FROM YOU.

01:57.600 --> 02:00.066
YOU KNOW, I COULD
TAKE YOU, TOPANGA.

02:03.133 --> 02:04.600
MAIL! MAIL, MAIL, MAIL!

02:04.600 --> 02:06.300
ERIC, THERE MUST BE
THOUSANDS OF GUYS

02:06.300 --> 02:07.967
TRYING TO GET
ON<i>SINGLED OUT.</i>

02:07.967 --> 02:10.200
IT'LL PROBABLY
TAKE THEM MONTHS
TO MAKE A DECISION--

02:10.200 --> 02:13.567
AND YET, LOOKEE HERE.
TO "ERIC MATTHEWS"
FROM "M-T..."

02:13.567 --> 02:17.900
I CAN'T MAKE OUT

02:17.900 --> 02:18.767

02:21.934 --> 02:23.300
LET'S SEE HERE.

02:24.867 --> 02:26.600

ON BEING SELECTED

02:26.600 --> 02:29.500
"TO APPEAR AS A CONTESTANT

AND PLEASE DON'T BRING YOUR
NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE DAD."

02:32.600 --> 02:34.567
WHAT? LET ME SEE THAT.

02:37.100 --> 02:39.100
WOW, THEY REALLY PUT THAT.

02:42.133 --> 02:44.133
MR. FEENY,
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.467
HOW COULD YOU NOT BE HERE?

02:48.467 --> 02:49.667
MR. FEENY!

02:49.667 --> 02:50.900
MR. FEENY!

02:52.100 --> 02:55.100
MR. MATTHEWS...
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

02:55.100 --> 02:57.500
I GOT A PROBLEM.
YOU'RE NOT OUT HERE
GARDENING.

02:57.500 --> 03:00.800
YOU'RE NOT SCHOOLING,
YOU'RE NOT GARDENING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:00.800 --> 03:02.600
I'M SORRY.
I'M HERE NOW.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.133
OKAY.

03:04.133 --> 03:07.500
I'VE BEEN SELECTED
TO BE ON THIS MTV GAME SHOW
<i>SINGLED OUT.</i>

03:07.500 --> 03:09.500
THEY'RE GONNA INTERVIEW ME
BEFORE I GO ON THE SHOW,

03:09.500 --> 03:11.700
AND I KNOW THEY'RE GONNA
ASK ME WHAT COLLEGE I GO TO.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.100
YOU DON'T GO
TO A COLLEGE.

03:13.100 --> 03:15.200
THE ONE THING
I DON'T WANT TO SAY
IS HARVARD.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.867
THEY'RE GONNA KNOW
I DON'T GO TO HARVARD.

03:16.867 --> 03:19.367
THEY'RE GONNA THINK
I'M SO STUPID BECAUSE
I DON'T KNOW THE NAME

03:19.367 --> 03:20.767
OF SOME OTHER
PRESTIGIOUS SCHOOL,

03:20.767 --> 03:23.300
SO COULD YOU GIVE ME
THE NAME OF THE SCHOOL
YOU WENT TO,

03:23.300 --> 03:24.600
IF IT STILL EXISTS?

03:24.600 --> 03:26.600
I WON'T DO THAT,
MR. MATTHEWS.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.033
GONE, HUH?

03:28.033 --> 03:30.600
I WON'T BE A PARTY
TO THIS DECEPTION.

03:30.600 --> 03:35.233
MY ADVICE TO YOU
IS THINK LONG AND HARD
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

03:38.667 --> 03:40.400
COLLEGE?
HARVARD.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.934
HARVARD?

03:41.934 --> 03:44.500
YEAH. GO, SMART GUYS.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.834
HEY...TELL ME,
IF YOU GO TO HARVARD,

03:47.834 --> 03:51.000
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE
IN PHILADELPHIA?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.200
I GO TO THE
PHILADELPHIA CAMPUS.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.400
THEY HAVE
A PHILADELPHIA CAMPUS?

03:56.400 --> 03:58.667
THEY HAVE 6.
STOP TRYING TO TRAP ME.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.467
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
CHOSE YOU BECAUSE
OF YOUR HAIR.

04:00.467 --> 04:02.600
I UNDERSTAND.
SEE YOU ON
THE SHOW TOMORROW.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.300
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
BYE.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.567
DADDY?

04:11.567 --> 04:13.400
ARE YOU LEAVING?

04:13.400 --> 04:16.200
WELL, ONLY BECAUSE
VISITING HOURS ARE OVER,

04:16.200 --> 04:18.200
AND IF I STAY
ANY LONGER,

04:18.200 --> 04:20.200
THEY'RE GONNA
CHARGE ME $4,500.

04:20.200 --> 04:23.400
WELL, YOU ARE MY DAD,
AND IF YOU'RE NOT WORRIED,

04:23.400 --> 04:25.667
THEN EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE OK, HUH?

04:25.667 --> 04:27.367
CORY, THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

04:27.367 --> 04:30.600
THIS IS
A ROUTINE PROCEDURE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.500
THEY WON'T SLIP
AND CUT OFF MY HEAD?

04:33.500 --> 04:35.000
THIS IS
THE BEST HOSPITAL

04:35.000 --> 04:36.967
WITH THE BEST
DOCTORS IN THE CITY.

04:36.967 --> 04:40.000
DO YOU THINK
THEY JUST LET
ANYBODY IN HERE?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.700
WELL, THE FIRST THING
IS SECURITY AROUND HERE
SUCKS.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.500
HOW'D YOU GET IN HERE?

04:45.500 --> 04:47.934
NEVER MIND ME.
WE GOTTA GET YOU

04:52.400 --> 04:53.900

04:53.900 --> 04:55.400
WE GOTTA GET YOU
OUT OF HERE

04:55.400 --> 04:57.033
BEFORE YOU LOSE
YOUR WHOLE BODY.

04:57.033 --> 04:59.500
YOU'RE STARTING
THAT CRAZY TALK AGAIN.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.467
OH, CRAZY, AM I?

05:01.467 --> 05:03.834

05:11.000 --> 05:13.133
SHAWN, I'M QUITE PRONE

05:13.133 --> 05:16.033
SO I WOULD APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU DIDN'T BRING IN

05:16.033 --> 05:19.567
INVENTED STORIES

SUPERMARKET TABLOIDS, OK?

05:19.567 --> 05:22.000
IT'S IN

05:23.834 --> 05:26.567

SHAWN, YOU ARE CRAZY.

05:32.967 --> 05:35.667
P.A.: DR. HUNTER,
YOU'RE WANTED IN DELIVERY.

05:35.667 --> 05:39.000
CRAZY, HUH? WELL,
THIS HOSPITAL DOESN'T
SEEM TO THINK SO.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.100
IT'S ANOTHER DR. HUNTER,
SHAWN.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.200
I'M GOING TO DELIVERY.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.900

06:16.033 --> 06:19.400
LET'S MEET HIM,

06:32.967 --> 06:34.400
TAKE THE MASK OFF,
ERIC.

06:36.467 --> 06:38.100
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE
FUNNY OR ANYTHING,

06:38.100 --> 06:39.700
BUT YOU'RE A VERY
ATTRACTIVE MAN.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.600
IT'S LIKE LOOKING
IN A MIRROR.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.100
NO. I DON'T THINK SO.

06:43.100 --> 06:45.734
ERIC, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TELL THE GIRLS
A LITTLE ABOUT YOURSELF,

06:45.734 --> 06:47.600
THE BIG HARVARD MAN
THAT YOU ARE.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.900
HARVARD UNIVERSITY,
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.400
OH, NO, NO, NO.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.667
IT'S A HUGE SCHOOL.
WHAT, 35,000 STUDENTS?

06:52.667 --> 06:54.367
WHY DON'T WE--
SOME STUDENTS THERE--

06:54.367 --> 06:55.700
JUST PLAY THE GAME?

06:55.700 --> 06:58.200
OH, AND HE'S MODEST,

WHAT A CATCH.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.300
WELL, ERIC'S A JUNIOR

07:00.300 --> 07:03.667
HE CURRENTLY MAINTAINS
A GPA OF 7.0.

07:03.667 --> 07:05.867
I DIDN'T DO TOO HOT
IN SCIENCE.

07:05.867 --> 07:07.867
Chris: VERY NICE.
SCIENCE WASN'T GOOD.

07:07.867 --> 07:09.900
DO WE HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT THIS ON THE AIR?

07:09.900 --> 07:11.467
NO, WE DON'T,
AND WE WON'T.

07:11.467 --> 07:13.200
WE'LL GO TO
OUR BOARD HERE.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.200
OUR CATEGORIES ARE:
FIRST DATE, BRAINS,

07:15.200 --> 07:16.734
HYGIENE, AGE, HEIGHT,

07:16.734 --> 07:18.400
WHERE WOULD YOU
LIKE TO START?

07:18.400 --> 07:20.834
OK. WHY DON'T WE START
WITH FIRST DATE?

07:20.834 --> 07:22.300
ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD.

07:25.100 --> 07:27.700
WELL, I KNOW MY MOM
WOULD WANT ME TO SEND AWAY
THE NAUGHTY GIRLS, BUT--

07:27.700 --> 07:30.233
ALL RIGHT! HAVE YOU
BEEN NAUGHTY, GET OUT!

07:30.233 --> 07:32.367

07:33.767 --> 07:36.000

WITH...YOU!

07:40.600 --> 07:42.500
NO! CHRIS!

07:42.500 --> 07:45.700
NO, HI! HI!
I DIDN'T MEAN YOU.

07:45.700 --> 07:47.300
I DIDN'T MEAN--
HELLO!

07:47.300 --> 07:49.834
HI! YOU CAN WAIT
FOR ME OUTSIDE.

07:49.834 --> 07:51.200
I CAN BE NAUGHTY.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.500
HE TRICKED ME!

07:52.500 --> 07:54.300
IT WAS--HI.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.367
OH...CHRIS,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?

07:56.367 --> 07:59.467
YOU'RE A STRONG MAN,
SACRIFICING ALL THAT
JUST TO MAKE MOM PROUD.

07:59.467 --> 08:00.567
YOU'RE SWEET
AND SENSITIVE,

08:00.567 --> 08:02.400
EXACTLY THE KIND OF GUY
EVERY GIRL WANTS.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.567
IS THAT NOT TRUE,
LADIES?

08:07.100 --> 08:09.000
WHERE WOULD YOU
LIKE TO GO NEXT?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.767
I WANNA GO WITH
THE NAUGHTY GIRLS.

08:10.767 --> 08:13.500
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
PICK SOMETHING HERE
FROM THE BOARD.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.300
OK. LET'S TRY...BRAINS.

08:16.300 --> 08:20.300
ALL RIGHT, BRAINS.
WE HAVE EINSTEIN

08:20.300 --> 08:22.467
ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE NOT
GONNA FOOL ME THIS TIME.

08:22.467 --> 08:24.367
I KNOW IF I SAY
BEER STEIN FIRST--

08:24.367 --> 08:25.867
ALL RIGHT,
BEER STEINS, GET OUT!

08:25.867 --> 08:27.133

08:45.033 --> 08:46.467
ERIC, FORGET ABOUT THEM!

08:46.467 --> 08:47.967
OH, FINE.

08:47.967 --> 08:51.467
WE'VE NARROWED IT DOWN
TO OUR LAST 5 BRAINY,
CHASTE GIRLS.

08:51.467 --> 08:52.800
IT'S BAD, ISN'T IT?

08:52.800 --> 08:55.133
NO, NO. REALLY,
IT'S FINE, IT'S FINE.

08:55.133 --> 08:57.367
THEY'RE EXACTLY THE KIND
OF GIRLS YOU WANTED.

08:57.367 --> 09:00.100
SWEET, SENSITIVE, INTELLIGENT,
AND FULLY-CLOTHED, AND...

09:00.100 --> 09:03.133
WE WILL SEE HOW BAD IT IS
FOR ERIC WHEN WE COME BACK.

09:03.133 --> 09:05.100
NAUGHTY!
I MEANT NAUGHTY!

09:05.100 --> 09:06.467
IT'S OVER. LET IT GO.

09:06.467 --> 09:07.900

09:35.834 --> 09:39.133
WELL, HERE WE ARE.
IT'S<i>SINGLED OUT,</i>
<i>THE FINAL ROUND,</i>

09:39.133 --> 09:41.100

THERE USED TO BE 50.

09:42.934 --> 09:44.834
LET IT GO, MATH BOY.

09:44.834 --> 09:48.000
BEFORE THE SHOW,
WE GAVE ERIC A POP QUIZ,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
YOU GOT TO TRY
TO MATCH HIS ANSWERS.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
WITH EACH CORRECT ANSWER,
YOU STEP FORWARD.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.834
IF YOU GET
IN THE CIRCLE FIRST,

09:53.834 --> 09:56.367
YOU GET TO GO OUT
WITH OUR HARVARD HUNK ERIC.

09:56.367 --> 09:58.300
HARVARD HUNK!
YOU HEAR THAT, MR. FEENY?

09:58.300 --> 10:00.033
FOCUS. WE'RE HERE.
SORRY.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.133
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S BEGIN.

10:01.133 --> 10:03.233
BAD KISSERS:
DUMP 'EM OR TRAIN 'EM?

10:03.233 --> 10:04.367
DUMP 'EM!

10:04.367 --> 10:05.500
TRAIN 'EM!

10:05.500 --> 10:06.800
TRAIN 'EM!

10:06.800 --> 10:08.400
WHAT'D YOU SAY,
ERIC?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.200
WELL, I'M GONNA TAKE
THE TIME.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.667
I'M GONNA TRAIN 'EM.

10:11.667 --> 10:13.600
Chris:
TRAIN 'EM!

10:13.600 --> 10:16.667
A GUY WHO LISTENS
IS SENSITIVE
OR PICTURING YOU NAKED?

10:16.667 --> 10:17.900
NAKED.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.033
SENSITIVE.

10:19.033 --> 10:20.400
SENSITIVE.
ERIC?

10:20.400 --> 10:24.500
WELL, CHRIS, I WAS SENSITIVE
ENOUGH TO WRITE DOWN...

10:24.500 --> 10:28.000
SENSITIVE.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.867
THIS COULD BE
THE FINAL QUESTION.

10:29.867 --> 10:31.500
BEST WAY TO WAKE UP:

10:31.500 --> 10:34.200
STEAMY HOT COCOA FOR 2
OR STEAMY HOT SHOWER FOR 2?

10:34.200 --> 10:35.200
SHOWER!

10:35.200 --> 10:36.300
SHOWER!

10:36.300 --> 10:37.600
ACTUALLY, COCOA.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.600
AND YOU WERE DOING
SO WELL, TOO.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.767
ERIC, SHOW US SHOWER!

10:41.767 --> 10:45.667
WELL, ACTUALLY,
THE THING IS I KIND
OF REALLY LIKE COCOA!

10:45.667 --> 10:47.500
OK. NOT A PROBLEM.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.567
STAND UP.
YOU KNOW, THE SHOW
MAY ACTUALLY WORK,

10:50.567 --> 10:52.400
WHICH COMPLETELY
BLOWS MY MIND.

10:52.400 --> 10:56.967
ALL RIGHT, ERIC.
SHE'S ALL THE THINGS
YOU WANTED IN A GIRL.

10:56.967 --> 10:59.367
SHE'S SMART,
SHE'S SWEET,
SHE'S SENSITIVE.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.200
SHE LIKES COCOA,
WHATEVER.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.600
AND SHE'S A SOPHOMORE
AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.100
TURN AROUND AND MEET
LISA THURMAN.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.567
CONGRATULATIONS!

11:10.200 --> 11:11.667
TAMI!

11:11.667 --> 11:14.667
Tami: ERIC,
YOU AND LISA WILL ENJOY
A NIGHT ON THE TOWN...

11:14.667 --> 11:16.233
YOU'RE A JUNIOR
AT HARVARD?

11:16.233 --> 11:18.000
ESCORTED IN YOUR OWN
PERSONAL LIMO!

11:18.000 --> 11:19.667
YEAH. YOU GO
TO COLUMBIA?

11:19.667 --> 11:20.834
YEAH.

11:20.834 --> 11:22.734
AFTER SEEING THE SIGHTS
OF HISTORIC PHILADELPHIA,

11:22.734 --> 11:24.200
YOU'LL SETTLE
INTO A COZY BOOTH...

11:24.200 --> 11:26.567
YOU LIKE IT THERE?
YEAH. I LIKE IT A LOT.

11:26.567 --> 11:29.100
AT ONE OF PHILADELPHIA'S
BEST KEPT SECRETS: CHUBBIE'S.

11:29.100 --> 11:30.100
CHUBBIE'S?

11:30.100 --> 11:32.000
OH, I LOVE THAT PLACE!

11:32.000 --> 11:33.600
REALLY?
I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE.

11:33.600 --> 11:34.500
REALLY?

11:34.500 --> 11:35.834
THAT'S THE END
OF THE SHOW.

11:35.834 --> 11:37.500
THANKS FOR WATCHING
<i>SINGLED OUT.</i>

11:37.500 --> 11:39.667
LISTEN. I JUST WANT TO SAY
NICE HAIR.

11:39.667 --> 11:41.133
HEY, BACK AT YOU.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.834
THANKS, BUDDY.
GOOD LUCK.

11:42.834 --> 11:44.200
OK.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.200
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.700
YEAH, HE IS.

11:47.700 --> 11:49.300
SO, UH, CHUBBIE'S.

11:49.300 --> 11:50.767
YEAH.

11:53.300 --> 11:54.667
IT'S A MILD SEDATIVE.

11:54.667 --> 11:57.133
IT SHOULD RELAX HIM
BEFORE WE TAKE HIM TO O.R.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.700
MIGHT MAKE HIM
A LITTLE GROGGY.

11:59.700 --> 12:02.133
I'LL HAVE THE SOUP.

12:02.133 --> 12:04.500
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA HAVE,
KING LOUIS?

12:07.300 --> 12:08.600
NO CHANGE YET.

12:08.600 --> 12:11.367
HONEY, THEY'RE ABOUT READY
TO TAKE YOU IN TO SURGERY.

12:11.367 --> 12:13.934
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.100
SPONGE BATH?

12:15.100 --> 12:16.000
NO.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.800
ALAN...AMY?

12:18.800 --> 12:21.734
GEORGE, IT'S VERY SWEET
OF YOU TO VISIT,

12:21.734 --> 12:23.767
BUT CORY HASN'T EVEN
BEEN IN FOR HIS SURGERY.

12:23.767 --> 12:27.100
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I RECEIVED AN URGENT
PHONE CALL...

12:27.100 --> 12:28.867
IMPLORING ME
TO COME DOWN.

12:28.867 --> 12:30.834
FEENY...

12:30.834 --> 12:33.133
I'M HERE, MR. MATTHEWS.

12:33.133 --> 12:35.133
CLOSER.

12:35.133 --> 12:36.500
I'M CLOSE ENOUGH.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.300
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.600
NOW, I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.734
I NEED TO MAKE PEACE
WITH YOU.

12:44.600 --> 12:45.667
SEDATIVE.

12:45.667 --> 12:49.867
AH...WELL,
ALL IS FORGIVEN,
MR. MATTHEWS.

12:49.867 --> 12:51.400
I WISH IT WAS
THAT SIMPLE.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.834
I'VE DONE A LOT OF BAD
TO YOU OVER THE YEARS.

12:53.834 --> 12:56.100
I WANNA MAKE THINGS RIGHT
BETWEEN US.

12:56.100 --> 12:58.100
YOU'RE MAKING ME
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.

12:58.100 --> 13:00.300
FOR ONCE,
JUST LISTEN TO ME.

13:00.300 --> 13:02.867
IN THE CLASSROOM
UNDER MY DESK IS A KEY.

13:02.867 --> 13:05.367
THE KEY WILL OPEN
AIRPORT LOCKER B-378.

13:05.367 --> 13:08.100
IN THE LOCKER IS
A TATTERED PLAID VALISE.

13:08.100 --> 13:11.100
IN THE VALISE
YOU WILL FIND
ALL MY HOMEWORK...

13:11.100 --> 13:12.900
FOR 5 YEARS.

13:12.900 --> 13:16.233
YOU SEE, ALL THESE YEARS,
I'VE UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING.

13:16.233 --> 13:19.000
I'M ACTUALLY
A BRILLIANT STUDENT.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.133
WHAT IS THE CAPITAL
OF MONTANA?

13:24.200 --> 13:27.100
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO THE AIRPORT, ARE YA?

13:27.100 --> 13:29.800
NO.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.200
[CORY SIGHS]

13:31.200 --> 13:35.500
OK. WE'LL SEE YOU
IN A COUPLE HOURS.

13:35.500 --> 13:39.000
NO. I'M VANISHED.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.900
I AM VANISHED.

13:41.900 --> 13:46.467
"15-YEAR-OLD BOY
VANISHES DURING
SURGERY."

13:46.467 --> 13:48.000
THIS IS IDIOTIC.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.800
NOT EVEN CORY
COULD BELIEVE THIS
COULD HAPPEN TO HIM.

13:59.300 --> 14:04.000
Announcer: THIS IS TELEVISION'S
HARDEST-HITTING EXPLORATION
OF UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA...

14:06.000 --> 14:08.834
AND NOW, HERE IS ANCHOR
GRANT STEELE.

14:08.834 --> 14:11.600
DURING WHAT WAS TERMED
A ROUTINE TONSILLECTOMY

14:11.600 --> 14:13.600
AT A PHILADELPHIA AREA
HOSPITAL,

14:13.600 --> 14:17.834
15-YEAR-OLD CORY MATTHEWS
VANISHED!

14:17.834 --> 14:21.567
HERE I AM WITH THE STORY.

14:21.567 --> 14:24.000
THIS BED IS EMPTY...

14:24.000 --> 14:28.800
BECAUSE A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY
IS NOT IN IT.

14:28.800 --> 14:33.600
WE TALKED TO THE TWO
GRIEF-STRICKEN PARENTS.

14:33.600 --> 14:38.500
AMY, ALAN, TELL US
IN YOUR OWN GRIEF-STRICKEN
WORDS WHAT HAPPENED.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.734
WELL, HE WAS ABOUT
TO GO INTO SURGERY.

14:40.734 --> 14:42.734
WE WERE LOOKING
RIGHT AT HIM.

14:42.734 --> 14:45.000
YOU WERE LOOKING
RIGHT AT HIM.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
WE WERE LOOKING
RIGHT AT HIM, AND, UH,

14:49.000 --> 14:50.500
HE...VANISHED.

14:50.500 --> 14:53.700
WHEN YOU SAY
VANISHED,
YOU MEAN...

14:53.700 --> 14:54.967
HE DISAPPEARED.

14:54.967 --> 14:57.700
WHEN YOU SAY
DISAPPEARED,

14:57.700 --> 14:59.000
YOU MEAN...

14:59.000 --> 15:01.200
HE VANISHED.

15:02.467 --> 15:05.200
HOW ABOUT THAT?

15:05.200 --> 15:06.367
OF COURSE HE VANISHED.

15:06.367 --> 15:08.000
I TOLD HIM HE'D VANISH,
AND HE VANISHED.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.567
I EVEN KNOW
WHERE HE WENT.

15:09.567 --> 15:11.033
HE WENT
WHERE THEY ALL GO.

15:11.033 --> 15:12.400
TO THE FOURTH DIMENSION,

15:12.400 --> 15:14.767
SOMETIMES KNOWN
AS THE BOTTLE CITY
OF KANDOR.

15:14.767 --> 15:16.567
BUT NOBODY
LISTENS TO ME.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.567
THEY ALL THINK
I'M CRAZY.

15:18.567 --> 15:19.567
ARE YOU?

15:19.567 --> 15:21.300
AM I? AM I CRAZY?

15:21.300 --> 15:24.200
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S
FOR YOU TO DECIDE.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.900
NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME,

15:25.900 --> 15:28.567
I GOTTA GO SEW
THIS GUY'S HEAD
BACK ON.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.700
HIS SCHOOL PRINCIPAL,
DEVOTED TEACHER,

15:37.700 --> 15:40.000
AND NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,
GEORGE FEENY.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.367
ARE YOU SURPRISED
CORY MATTHEWS
HAS VANISHED?

15:44.367 --> 15:47.400
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
IT'S ALL HERE.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.967
5 YEARS OF HOMEWORK,

15:48.967 --> 15:50.233
JUST AS THE BOY SAID.

15:50.233 --> 15:52.100
AND THESE PAPERS
ARE REMARKABLE.

15:52.100 --> 15:54.667
SUCH INSIGHT,
SUCH PERSPICACITY.

15:54.667 --> 15:57.500
HOW COULD I HAVE DOUBTED HIM?

15:57.500 --> 15:59.200
HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW,

15:59.200 --> 16:03.200
KNOWING YOU
WERE WRONG ABOUT HIM
ALL THESE YEARS?

16:03.200 --> 16:05.033
ABOUT THE SAME.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.367
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT.

16:09.367 --> 16:11.734
CORY MATTHEWS,
IF YOU'RE OUT THERE,

16:11.734 --> 16:13.133
YOU'RE...

16:13.133 --> 16:14.900
SORT OF MISSED.

16:14.900 --> 16:17.500
GOOD NIGHT, AND WE'LL SEE YOU
ON THE NEXT EDITION OF...

16:25.800 --> 16:29.100
YOU WERE EMBARRASSED?
I WAS THE ONE
WHO WAS EMBARRASSED.

16:29.100 --> 16:31.400
BUT YOU SEEMED
SO CONFIDENT UP THERE.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.567
YEAH? YOU BOUGHT
MY CONFIDENT THING?

16:33.567 --> 16:35.567
OH, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ADORABLE.

16:35.567 --> 16:38.734
THE THINGS YOU
WERE SAYING WERE
SO CUTE AND SMART.

16:38.734 --> 16:41.100
WELL, OF COURSE
YOU'RE SMART,
GOING TO HARVARD.

16:41.100 --> 16:45.033
WELL, YOU MUST BE
PRETTY SMART YOURSELF.
YOU GOT INTO COLUMBIA.

16:45.033 --> 16:46.700
YEAH, BUT I
NEVER THOUGHT

16:46.700 --> 16:50.000
I'D HAVE SO MUCH
IN COMMON
WITH A HARVARD BOY.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.800
WILL YOU FORGET
ABOUT HARVARD?

16:51.800 --> 16:53.300
OK.

16:53.300 --> 16:55.100
THE ONLY REASON
I EVEN WENT ON THAT SHOW

16:55.100 --> 16:57.400
IS BECAUSE IT'S SO HARD
TO MEET SOMEBODY LIKE YOU.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.800
DON'T YOU MEET A LOT
OF GIRLS IN BOSTON?

16:59.800 --> 17:02.700
UH, YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'M IN CLASS ALL THE TIME.

17:02.700 --> 17:07.200
WHEN I'M NOT IN CLASS,
I'M ON<i>SINGLED OUT</i>
AND STUFF,

17:07.200 --> 17:08.700
SO IT'S REALLY HARD
TO MEET PEOPLE.

17:08.700 --> 17:11.800
HOW ABOUT YOU?
AREN'T THERE A LOT
OF NICE GUYS AT COLUMBIA?

17:13.500 --> 17:14.934
YEAH...THERE ARE.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.400
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

17:18.400 --> 17:22.667
THIS WOULD'VE BEEN
SO MUCH EASIER
IF YOU WERE A JERK.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.667
WHAT?

17:24.667 --> 17:27.900
ERIC, I'M NOT
WHAT YOU THINK I AM.

17:27.900 --> 17:29.033
I LIED.

17:29.033 --> 17:30.900
YOU LIED?

17:30.900 --> 17:32.900
YOU'RE REALLY ONE
OF THE NAUGHTY GIRLS?

17:32.900 --> 17:35.667
AW...THERE, I'M OVER IT.
HOW NAUGHTY ARE YOU?

17:35.667 --> 17:37.400
I'M PRETTY NAUGHTY,
ERIC.

17:37.400 --> 17:38.834
WELL, I'M NOT HERE
TO JUDGE.

17:38.834 --> 17:42.000
ERIC, I DON'T GO
TO COLUMBIA.

17:43.033 --> 17:44.500
WHAT?

17:44.500 --> 17:47.033
I APPLIED,
BUT I DIDN'T GET IN.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.100
I DIDN'T GET IN
ANYWHERE.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.233
I WENT ON <i>SINGLED OUT</i>

17:49.233 --> 17:51.567
BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED
TO DATE A COLLEGE GUY

17:51.567 --> 17:55.033
BECAUSE IT WOULD
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER
ABOUT MYSELF.

17:55.033 --> 17:57.400
WOW!

17:58.600 --> 18:00.667
WHERE DO I START?

18:00.667 --> 18:03.467
I'M SORRY.
I'LL LEAVE IF YOU WANT.

18:03.467 --> 18:05.300
NO. NO, DON'T LEAVE.
I'LL LEAVE.

18:05.300 --> 18:07.467
I REALLY SHOULD BE
THE ONE LEAVING.

18:07.467 --> 18:12.100
YOU? I'M THE
PATHETIC TOWNIE WHO LIED
TO GET ON A GAME SHOW.

18:12.100 --> 18:14.233
LISA, IF I HELD UP
MY CARD,

18:14.233 --> 18:17.400
IT WOULD SAY EXACTLY
THE SAME THING.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.567
WHAT?

18:20.367 --> 18:21.967
I DON'T GO TO HARVARD.

18:21.967 --> 18:25.000
I MEAN, I DID
THE SAME THING YOU DID,

18:25.000 --> 18:26.800
BUT YOU CONFESSED FIRST.

18:28.967 --> 18:31.133
YOU KNOW, I WASN'T
EVEN GONNA CONFESS.

18:31.133 --> 18:33.900
I WAS GONNA LET YOU THINK
I REALLY WENT TO HARVARD

18:33.900 --> 18:36.900
UNTIL YOU LIKED ME ANYWAY
AND I FELT BETTER ABOUT MYSELF.

18:36.900 --> 18:38.133
THEN, I DON'T KNOW,

18:38.133 --> 18:41.400
I'D HAVE MY PARENTS
CALL YOU AND TELL YOU I DIED.

18:44.967 --> 18:48.934
WOW! WE REALLY
ARE COMPATIBLE.

18:50.967 --> 18:52.467
YEAH.

18:52.467 --> 18:56.233
SO, YOU WANNA CUT
THE CLASSES WE DON'T HAVE
AND SEE A MOVIE?

18:56.233 --> 18:58.600
I HEAR THERE'S
A GREAT PARTY
AT SWARTHMORE.

18:58.600 --> 18:59.500
WANNA GO?

18:59.500 --> 19:01.100
YOU CAN GET US IN?

19:01.100 --> 19:02.867
ACTUALLY,
I THOUGHT YOU COULD.

19:02.867 --> 19:06.900
WELL...ONE DAY I WILL.

19:14.834 --> 19:16.133
FEEL BETTER NOW, CORY?

19:16.133 --> 19:17.667
I'M COMPLETELY RECOVERED,
DARLING.

19:17.667 --> 19:19.367
THEY MIGHT'VE TAKEN OUT
MY TONSILS,

19:19.367 --> 19:21.500
BUT THEY COULD NEVER
TAKE OUT MY LOVE FOR YOU.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.000
SO, WHAT DO YOU GOT,
SOUP?

19:24.000 --> 19:25.033
SHERBET.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.834
CHICKEN AND RICE.

19:26.834 --> 19:28.767
YOU'RE STILL
A LITTLE WOOZY,
AREN'T YOU?

19:28.767 --> 19:30.500
I'M SEEING 5 OF YA.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.934
YOU FEEL STRONG ENOUGH
TO TAKE A WALK
AROUND THE HALLWAYS?

19:32.934 --> 19:35.667
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I WOULD WALK ANYWHERE
FOR SOUP.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.467
CORY, I PICKED YOU UP
SOME COMIC--

19:46.467 --> 19:48.000
COR?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
CORY, WHERE ARE YOU?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.300
OH, NO.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.467
IT HAPPENED.

19:54.467 --> 19:56.400
HE VANISHED!

19:56.400 --> 19:57.934
AND I'M NEXT.

19:57.934 --> 19:59.934
I KNOW WAY TOO MUCH.

19:59.934 --> 20:01.934
OH, NO, IT'S HAPPENING!

20:01.934 --> 20:03.867
I'M STARTING
TO DEMATERIALIZE.

20:06.600 --> 20:10.100
Cory: SHAWN?

20:10.100 --> 20:11.400
TOPANGA
AND HER 4 SISTERS

20:11.400 --> 20:12.734
ARE TAKING ME
FOR SOUP.

20:12.734 --> 20:13.834
YOU WANT IN?

20:13.834 --> 20:15.400
YEAH. SURE.
