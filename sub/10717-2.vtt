00:01.030 --> 00:03.123
You want to make this
a black thing.

00:03.170 --> 00:05.968
Well, I'm not black.
I'm O.J.!

00:06.000 --> 00:08.161
ANNOUNCER:
The People v. 0.]. Simpson.

00:08.200 --> 00:10.703
All new,
Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.010 --> 00:15.332
FX presents The Americans.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.819
Previously on
"The Americans"...

00:20.850 --> 00:22.386
We work for our country.
The Soviet Union.

00:22.420 --> 00:24.980
Paige, if you
do tell anyone,

00:25.020 --> 00:27.318
we will go to jail for good.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.487
ELIZABETH: I just keep picturing
her walking in there

00:29.530 --> 00:30.849
and spitting
the whole thing out.

00:30.890 --> 00:32.824
What do you think
it's like for Nina,

00:32.860 --> 00:34.498
where she is right now?

00:34.530 --> 00:36.327
Can you imagine what she'd think
if someone told her

00:36.370 --> 00:37.860
the two of us
were Sitting here,

00:37.900 --> 00:40.733
doing what we're doing,
to try to get her out?

00:40.770 --> 00:42.863
I want to arrange a trip
for Elizabeth

00:42.910 --> 00:44.730
to see her mother
one last time.

00:44.770 --> 00:46.670
GABRIEL:
I wish it were possible,

00:46.710 --> 00:48.405
but we both know
that it isn't.

00:54.280 --> 00:57.010
There are certain weapons --
biological.

00:57.050 --> 01:00.213
One of us has been getting
samples for many years.

01:00.260 --> 01:01.682
Who is he?
William.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.757
No dead drops.
Keep it in your custody.

01:04.790 --> 01:06.519
Stan.

01:06.560 --> 01:07.754
Are you screwing my wife?

01:07.800 --> 01:09.529
God, no. I --

01:09.570 --> 01:11.026
don't lie to me!

01:11.070 --> 01:12.890
Jesus, stop!

01:22.480 --> 01:23.777
It's fine.

01:23.810 --> 01:25.107
(door closes)
He looked mad.

01:25.150 --> 01:26.469
He was.

01:27.980 --> 01:30.619
(sighs heavily)

01:38.760 --> 01:40.421
(switch clicks)

01:40.460 --> 01:43.588

01:50.110 --> 01:52.908

02:09.120 --> 02:10.826
(cooler thuds)

02:10.860 --> 02:13.829
(screen thuds)

02:18.000 --> 02:19.297
(sighs)

02:19.340 --> 02:21.194
(sighs deeply)

02:23.710 --> 02:26.008
What was that all about?

02:27.710 --> 02:30.270
(sighs deeply)
It was, um...

02:30.310 --> 02:34.371
It was about...Sandra.

02:38.650 --> 02:41.517
I've, um,
I've -- I've been...

02:41.560 --> 02:43.858
W-- (exhales deeply)

02:47.230 --> 02:49.698
(sighs deeply)

02:49.730 --> 02:52.961
Do you remember when I went
to est with him?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.467
Yeah.

02:54.500 --> 02:58.664
I went back...by myself.

03:00.740 --> 03:02.344
I was interested in it.

03:02.380 --> 03:03.870
(inhales deeply)

03:03.910 --> 03:06.845
I ran into Sandra,
and we went out afterwards,

03:06.880 --> 03:08.643
a couple of times.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.216
She really understands
all this stuff

03:10.250 --> 03:14.016
and she was helping explain
some of it to me.

03:15.590 --> 03:19.697
Stan found out and
took it the wrong way.

03:23.600 --> 03:26.569
How many times
have you gone?

03:26.600 --> 03:28.989
(sighs heavily) Um...

03:29.040 --> 03:31.907
I've done
the introductory seminar

03:31.940 --> 03:35.034
and...another one.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.877
Why?

03:39.620 --> 03:42.180
I don't know.
There's something about it.

03:42.220 --> 03:45.519
You learn things. You learn
how to deal with things.

03:45.550 --> 03:47.017
Like what?

03:47.060 --> 03:51.588
(sighs heavily)
Life, I guess.

03:51.630 --> 03:53.951
You know, everything.

03:57.400 --> 04:00.563
I mean, I knew...
[Inhales deeply]

04:00.600 --> 04:02.602
you were going through
something.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.108
(sighs)

04:05.140 --> 04:08.109
When did you say
you did all this?

04:08.140 --> 04:09.778
Um... (sighs)

04:09.810 --> 04:11.869
You know,
different nights.

04:11.910 --> 04:15.949
Um...when you were
in Germany.

04:22.790 --> 04:25.384
So...

04:25.430 --> 04:27.295
The other day, when you said
you felt something,

04:27.330 --> 04:30.060
is that...

04:30.100 --> 04:32.898
The kind of stuff
that they teach?

04:32.940 --> 04:34.635
What do you --
what do you mean?

04:34.670 --> 04:38.060
That you can feel something
instead of seeing something.

04:38.110 --> 04:44.970
No. No, it doesn't work
like that.

04:45.010 --> 04:46.409
How does it work?

04:46.450 --> 04:49.146
(sighs)

04:49.180 --> 04:51.011
It's hard to explain.

04:56.190 --> 05:00.456
Is it something that
you'd ever want me to go to?

05:07.970 --> 05:09.631
Sure.

05:11.310 --> 05:14.302
**

05:51.850 --> 05:55.047
20 years of E. coli
and hepatitis.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.219
I never thought
we'd get here.

05:57.250 --> 05:59.650
He didn't seem so happy
about it.

05:59.690 --> 06:02.318
Happiness is not exactly
his strong suit.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.988
In fact, his disposition
is one of the things

06:05.030 --> 06:08.227
that's kept him from rising
to the top of his laboratory.

06:08.260 --> 06:10.228
God knows he has
the brains for it.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.158
That a problem now?

06:12.200 --> 06:15.237
With everything that'll be
coming in at Fort Detrick, yes.

06:15.270 --> 06:17.830
His _low clearance
limits his access.

06:17.870 --> 06:20.009
There's nastier stuff
than this?

06:20.040 --> 06:21.871
Oh, much.

06:21.910 --> 06:26.847
The most virulent pathogens
are on biocontainment level 4.

06:26.880 --> 06:29.075
William is only cleared
for level 3.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.088
We'll have to, uh,
get the code

06:31.120 --> 06:33.350
so he can get in there
after hours.

06:33.390 --> 06:37.258
Elizabeth, here is a list
of everyone in his company.

06:38.790 --> 06:41.691
We have to move this out
of the country very carefully.

06:41.730 --> 06:43.197
I usually
take care of it myself,

06:43.230 --> 06:45.369
__ but this is _
a military-level operation.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.766
Now, why don't we
have you do it

06:47.800 --> 06:50.530
before they tell me
to have you do it?

06:50.570 --> 06:52.060
Why don't we have you do it

06:52.110 --> 06:54.078
until they tell you
to have me do it?

06:58.910 --> 07:00.912
(tin clatters)

07:00.950 --> 07:03.418
Come with me.

07:03.450 --> 07:07.250
**

07:18.100 --> 07:20.466
I have a surprise for you.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.559
It's a computer.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.568
For the kids, from you.

07:25.610 --> 07:26.907
I thought we agreed

07:26.940 --> 07:29.602
the Centre would stay quiet
for a while.

07:29.650 --> 07:33.142
It's a life skill these days
for any young person.

07:42.020 --> 07:43.920
(indistinct conversations)

07:43.960 --> 07:45.450

lighter clicks)

08:00.810 --> 08:03.472

08:32.710 --> 08:36.578

(inhales deeply)

08:51.590 --> 08:54.195

09:00.570 --> 09:02.060
WOMAN:
We can't do it Thursdays.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.159
Uh, the choir uses
that room for rehearsals.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.201
What about --
(click, tape advances)

09:06.240 --> 09:09.038
(click)
MAN: Yeah, I'm free next
Wednesday for the fundraiser,

09:09.080 --> 09:11.742
and I already told her
that I can take--
(click, tape advances)

09:11.780 --> 09:14.669
(click)
PAIGE: I think they would've.
I don't know.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.245
I promised them.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.087
I shouldn't have said anything.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.509
PASTOR TIM: You needed
to tell someone, Paige.

09:21.560 --> 09:26.020
Nobody can carry
this sort of thing alone.

09:26.060 --> 09:29.450

09:43.580 --> 09:44.899
(whirring stops)

09:44.950 --> 09:47.578
(panting) She told him.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.576
Everything.

09:49.620 --> 09:51.781
(sighs)

09:51.820 --> 09:53.117
Did he tell anyone?

09:53.160 --> 09:54.912
Not on the tape.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.416
(sighs)

09:56.460 --> 09:58.758
If we move fast,
maybe we're okay.

09:58.790 --> 10:01.258
You want to kill him?

10:01.300 --> 10:03.894
She will run
so far from here.

10:03.930 --> 10:05.568
We don't have a choice,
Philip.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.897
We could try to work him.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.931
That's insane.

10:11.270 --> 10:13.477
We could leave.

10:13.510 --> 10:16.070
Maybe we should leave.

10:16.110 --> 10:17.941
Philip...

10:17.980 --> 10:20.813
You want to kill the one person
in the world that she trusts?

10:20.850 --> 10:22.841
It's better than losing us.

10:29.690 --> 10:32.158
The CIA cleared it.

10:32.190 --> 10:33.953
They got the intel
from multiple sources,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.628
so...you can use it.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.292
I know I'm not, uh,
in the loop on Oleg Burov.

10:42.340 --> 10:45.468
I'm not keeping anything
from you, sir.
Sure.

10:45.510 --> 10:48.274
Well, I know it doesn't, uh,
matter what I say,

10:51.310 --> 10:54.768
on the occasions
you saw fit to make them,

10:54.820 --> 10:56.685
Burov doesn't strike me
as the kind of guy

10:56.720 --> 11:00.486
who responds to blackmail.

11:00.520 --> 11:03.284
This is better
than using those tapes.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.558
Yeah. Much.

11:08.400 --> 11:11.119
I heard you were going to
sit down with gene's parents.

11:11.170 --> 11:14.139
This afternoon.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.297
They have a lawyer.

11:16.340 --> 11:17.807
We didn't kill him.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.172
Oh, that much we know.

indistinctly on TV)

13:19.290 --> 13:22.418
He goes to a cabin
to write his sermons.

13:22.460 --> 13:24.325
Some...
(bottle clinks)

13:24.370 --> 13:26.429
Religious place, retreat.

13:26.470 --> 13:29.667
He'll be there
the day after tomorrow.

13:29.700 --> 13:32.100
I can go check it out tomorrow
after I see Gabriel.

13:32.140 --> 13:33.778
(sighs)
Maybe he'll have

13:33.810 --> 13:36.529
some brilliant idea
and save the day.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.318
(sighs)

13:41.980 --> 13:44.016
You all right?

13:44.050 --> 13:46.644
(sighs)
What do you want me to say?

13:46.690 --> 13:51.286
We can get this miserable
son of a bitch_ out of our lives.
(Sighs)

13:51.330 --> 13:52.854
Paige will have no reason
to suspect

13:52.900 --> 13:54.492
we had anything to do
with this.

13:54.530 --> 13:57.021
You ever try and pull her
into this job,

13:57.070 --> 13:58.822
and she gets even a whiff
of some of the shit

13:58.870 --> 14:00.497
we really do,

14:00.540 --> 14:02.462
she'll figure out
we killed him.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.536
Is that what you're
thinking about right now,

14:04.570 --> 14:06.663
whether or not she's gonna go
to medical school or law school?

14:06.710 --> 14:10.806
I'm -- I'm looking for
something good in all of this.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.216
Well, you might get
what you wanted.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.468
None of this
is what I wanted.

19:25.990 --> 19:28.527
(softly) What would have
made him think that?

19:28.560 --> 19:31.996
He was just acting strange,

19:32.030 --> 19:34.692
the whole flight.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.298
Is there any reason
he would've known?

19:36.340 --> 19:39.207
Anything he could've seen?

19:39.240 --> 19:40.969
I don't know.

19:41.010 --> 19:42.637
Not really.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.478
Look, maybe he just sensed
you were nervous.

19:45.510 --> 19:49.344
Is there any problem
getting it on the plane?

19:49.380 --> 19:50.813
Don't stare. It's okay.

19:50.850 --> 19:52.715
(exhales slowly)
It's nothing. Trust me.

19:52.750 --> 19:54.183
He's just doing his job,
going to the airport.

19:54.220 --> 19:55.687
Look out the window.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.566
(grunts softly)

20:09.540 --> 20:11.838
You all right?

20:11.870 --> 20:14.031
Oh, he, uh...

20:14.080 --> 20:17.948
He had some bad news,
but, uh, gonna be okay.

20:22.780 --> 20:24.714
(lowered voice)
Maybe we should go.

20:24.750 --> 20:26.411
(lowered voice) It's fine.

20:26.450 --> 20:28.611
It's not fine!

20:31.730 --> 20:34.198
Where are you
flying to, sir?

20:34.230 --> 20:35.697
Can I talk to you
for a second?

20:35.730 --> 20:37.869
Um, he got a call
this morning from his wife.

20:37.900 --> 20:39.697
Their son had an accident
last night

20:39.730 --> 20:41.266
and now he's in a hospital.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.530
And she's mad at him because
she thinks it's his fault.

20:43.570 --> 20:45.231
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.

20:45.270 --> 20:47.534
But when I see a distressed
pilot, I got to talk to them.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.104
Yeah.
It's my job.

20:49.140 --> 20:51.870
Of course.
Of -- of course. Yeah.

20:51.910 --> 20:54.117
I don't mean to intrude
on your personal life,

20:54.150 --> 20:56.209
but you don't look too good.
* ...Could give you

20:56.250 --> 20:58.218
I'm okay.
* Take my tears
and that's not nearly all *

20:58.250 --> 21:00.389
So, where are you
flying to today?
* That's not nearly all

21:00.420 --> 21:03.583
* Tainted love
* Oh, oh, oh, oh

21:03.630 --> 21:05.882
* Tainted love
(man gasping)

21:05.930 --> 21:10.560
* Now I know I've got to

21:10.600 --> 21:12.067
* Run away

21:12.100 --> 21:15.137
* I've got to get away

21:15.170 --> 21:18.901
* You don't really want
any more from me *
(both grunt)

21:18.940 --> 21:21.579
* To make things right

21:21.610 --> 21:25.273
* You need someone
to hold you tight *

21:25.310 --> 21:28.438
* And you think love
is to pray *

21:28.480 --> 21:33.417
* But I'm sorry,
I don't pray that way *

21:33.460 --> 21:35.587
* Once I ran to you

21:35.620 --> 21:37.087
*Iran

21:37.120 --> 21:39.088
* Now I run from you

21:39.130 --> 21:40.757
(bones crack)

21:40.800 --> 21:42.597
* This tain_ted love
you've given *

21:42.630 --> 21:46.589
* I give you all
a boy could give you *

21:46.630 --> 21:50.669
* Take my tears
and that's not nearly all *

21:50.710 --> 21:53.634
* Tainted love
* Oh, oh, oh

21:53.680 --> 21:56.979
* Tainted love
* Oh, oh, oh

21:57.010 --> 22:00.514
* Tainted love
* Oh, oh, oh

22:00.550 --> 22:03.610
* Tainted love
* Oh, oh, oh

22:03.650 --> 22:07.108
* Touch me, baby,
tainted love *

22:07.150 --> 22:09.311
* Tainted love

22:09.360 --> 22:10.622
(sighs)

25:51.210 --> 25:54.213
(indistinct conversations

26:00.620 --> 26:04.522
He said the test
was successful.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.687
Somewhat successful.

26:06.730 --> 26:08.925
They showed me the results.

26:12.570 --> 26:16.233
The radar signature
was reduced,

26:16.270 --> 26:18.363
but it was still there.

26:18.410 --> 26:21.072
So you made some progress.
Yes, but that's it.

26:21.110 --> 26:23.032
(inhales deeply)

26:23.080 --> 26:24.638
(sighs)

26:26.610 --> 26:30.068
I'm at the limits
of my understanding here.

26:30.120 --> 26:33.385
It doesn't matter
what they get me, I'm...

26:33.420 --> 26:35.888
i-i can't make
any more progress.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.478
Don't tell them that.

26:40.260 --> 26:43.252
It's okay.

26:43.300 --> 26:45.461
I'm not scared,

26:45.500 --> 26:47.968
just a little nervous.

26:56.140 --> 26:58.608
I wasn't going
to say anything.

26:58.650 --> 27:01.414
It's not finished.

27:01.450 --> 27:03.270
But I think I may have
found a way

27:03.320 --> 27:05.140
to let your son know
you're alive.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.087
What are you talking about?

27:10.120 --> 27:12.020
That's all I can say.

27:14.630 --> 27:16.188
Nina...

27:18.330 --> 27:21.128
I won't let you do anything
that could put you in danger.

27:21.170 --> 27:22.967
It's not up to you.

27:25.470 --> 27:28.439
I needed to do this.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.971
It's not just for you.

27:33.510 --> 27:35.671
What will happen to you?

27:35.720 --> 27:37.369
Nothing.

27:38.820 --> 27:40.139
Probably nothing.

27:44.690 --> 27:47.523
I don't know what to say.
I...

27:47.560 --> 27:49.494
In a place like this...

27:52.000 --> 27:54.036
...You have been a surprise.

27:56.670 --> 27:58.206
You, too.

28:07.180 --> 28:08.670
(lights click)

28:08.720 --> 28:11.689
(train wheels clacking,
crossing bell clanging)

28:35.540 --> 28:38.077
(sighs)

28:38.110 --> 28:39.372
(sniffles)

28:41.380 --> 28:44.042
So?

28:44.090 --> 28:46.547
They're not gonna
make the trade.

28:48.620 --> 28:50.178
There's some other prisoner
in Russia

28:50.220 --> 28:52.927
my government wants
more than Nina.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.765
(sighs)

29:05.070 --> 29:09.074
I wonder
whose life we saved.

29:09.110 --> 29:12.147
(train passing in distance)

29:18.820 --> 29:21.550
I heard about your brother.

29:21.590 --> 29:23.080
I'm so sorry.

29:23.990 --> 29:25.821
(sighs)

29:29.430 --> 29:31.295
So, we are friends now?

29:38.440 --> 29:39.759
(door closes)

29:42.110 --> 29:43.634
(train horn blows)

29:46.810 --> 29:48.949
(engine starts)

29:48.980 --> 29:50.982
(gears shift)

29:54.120 --> 29:55.985
(sighs)

29:58.530 --> 30:01.795
How'd it go?

30:01.830 --> 30:03.923
Pretty bad.

30:03.970 --> 30:06.621
The guy I was supposed
to hand over to,

30:06.670 --> 30:09.138
I tried to
get it back to Gabriel,

30:09.170 --> 30:10.637
but I couldn't reach him.

30:10.670 --> 30:12.501
So it's back in our house?

30:12.540 --> 30:14.974
You can't just leave it.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.609
You?

30:19.650 --> 30:23.017
The cabin has a space heater,
but there's a groundskeeper.

30:23.050 --> 30:25.541
We're both gonna
have to be there.

30:30.190 --> 30:33.523
You make up
with your boyfriend yet?

30:33.560 --> 30:35.494
Stan.

30:37.360 --> 30:38.668
Not yet.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.331
How bad did it go?

30:45.570 --> 30:49.506
I've been thinking a lot
about, um...

30:55.550 --> 30:59.646
There was this...kid,

30:59.690 --> 31:02.056
back home, after the war,

31:02.090 --> 31:06.186
when everything
was still torn up.

31:06.230 --> 31:08.994
He and his friends
used to come after me

31:09.030 --> 31:11.328
when I used to go across town
to get milk.

31:11.370 --> 31:16.160
You know, they'd take it from me
and beat the crap out of me.

31:16.200 --> 31:19.067
And one time,
I fought back,

31:19.110 --> 31:23.001
but I...
(inhales deeply)

31:23.040 --> 31:25.179
I really fought back.

31:25.210 --> 31:27.246
Good.

31:27.280 --> 31:31.683
They -- they were bigger
than me, but I had this rock.

31:31.720 --> 31:34.689
I hit them with it.

31:34.720 --> 31:38.019
I hit this one kid in the head
over and over...

31:38.060 --> 31:40.858
And over...

31:40.890 --> 31:42.790
Until, you know...

31:44.300 --> 31:46.723
How old were you?

31:46.770 --> 31:49.364
10.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.868
Hmm.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.401
I've been thinking about him
a lot.

31:54.440 --> 31:56.101
(sighs)

32:01.250 --> 32:06.745
This is the kind of thing
that comes up at est.

32:06.790 --> 32:08.883
Is that good?

32:08.920 --> 32:12.720
They help you
deal with it,

32:12.760 --> 32:14.955
but you have to think
about it.

32:19.100 --> 32:21.989
(crickets chirping)

32:29.110 --> 32:30.975
Pastor Tim?

32:32.680 --> 32:35.240
Pastor Tim?

32:35.280 --> 32:37.419
Pastor Tim?

32:37.450 --> 32:40.283
(screaming)

32:40.320 --> 32:43.756
No! (muffled screaming)

32:43.790 --> 32:45.257
(inhales sharply)

32:45.290 --> 32:48.293
(breathing heavily)

32:55.000 --> 32:56.695
(sighs)

33:16.320 --> 33:19.323
(indistinct conversations,
dog barking in distance)

33:35.340 --> 33:37.171
Feeling safe, are we?

33:37.210 --> 33:40.373
I liked you better
as a blonde.

33:40.410 --> 33:43.174
We have surveillance reports
from inside the FBI.

33:43.220 --> 33:46.678
They seem to be working.
Oh, that helps.

33:46.720 --> 33:50.212
Everybody's very happy
about the Fort Detrick contract,

33:50.260 --> 33:52.979
and they say everything's
paying off now, all your work.

33:53.030 --> 33:54.497
Is that what they say?

33:54.530 --> 33:57.226
I still haven't been able
to, um...

33:57.260 --> 33:58.727
Pass along your package.

33:58.770 --> 34:01.659
It'd be a lot easier
ifI could do a drop.

34:01.700 --> 34:05.329
Picture this --
some dog sniffing around

34:05.370 --> 34:08.999
or some little kid noses
into your dead drop.

34:09.040 --> 34:10.507
When has that
ever happened?

34:10.540 --> 34:13.907
Let's say
this is the one time

34:13.950 --> 34:17.670
the dog or kid opens it up.

34:17.720 --> 34:21.212
Tens of thousands of people
start oozing pus

34:21.260 --> 34:23.683
all over
the streets of DC.

34:23.720 --> 34:27.258
so, it's safe in my house?

34:27.290 --> 34:28.848
What do you want me to say?

34:28.900 --> 34:31.698
There's a reason
these things are kept

34:31.730 --> 34:34.858
in Hermetically sealed
biocontainment labs.

34:34.900 --> 34:38.609
Gabriel said something about
getting stuff from level 4.

34:38.640 --> 34:41.575
Do you even know
what level 4 is?

34:41.610 --> 34:43.202
One higher than level 3?

34:43.240 --> 34:45.379
I don't have access
to level 4.

34:45.410 --> 34:48.573
Yeah, we're working on
getting you the access code.

34:50.080 --> 34:53.447
Anything you can do
to not succeed

34:53.490 --> 34:56.414
would be
greatly appreciated.

35:11.940 --> 35:14.773
(indistinct conversations)

35:25.450 --> 35:28.089
Can we get that thing
out of our house?

35:28.120 --> 35:29.610
What happened?

35:29.660 --> 35:31.423
The courier didn't want it,
that's what happened.

35:31.460 --> 35:33.257
And I don't want it in my house,
not with my kids.

35:33.290 --> 35:34.996
We'll take care of it.

35:40.670 --> 35:43.138
Elizabeth, your mother died.

35:44.840 --> 35:48.606
We had someone with her.
She wasn't alone.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.938
And she spoke
of you and Paige,

35:50.980 --> 35:54.040
wanted to send a message
that she loved you.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.843
Did she?

36:03.820 --> 36:06.129
What do you mean?

36:06.160 --> 36:08.355
Did she really say that?

36:10.530 --> 36:12.191
Of course she did.

36:22.380 --> 36:24.701
Elizabeth...

36:24.750 --> 36:28.140
When you do what we do,

36:28.180 --> 36:31.980
it's very easy
to lose your bearings.

36:32.020 --> 36:35.080
I don't want that to happen
to you.

36:46.230 --> 36:49.563
(man speaking Russian
over P.A.)

38:16.790 --> 38:18.451
(sighs)

38:29.970 --> 38:31.437
Thanks, Stavos.

38:31.470 --> 38:33.461
Just, um, have him call me
as soon as he gets back.

38:33.510 --> 38:35.808
Oh, hang on a second.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.831
No, it's not him.
(door closes)

38:37.880 --> 38:39.677
All right, bye.

38:39.710 --> 38:41.177
(receiver clicks)

38:47.650 --> 38:51.950
What's wrong?

38:51.990 --> 38:55.153
I got word my mother died.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.366
Mom.

39:12.250 --> 39:15.708
(voice breaking) Oh,
I'm so glad you got to meet her.

39:15.750 --> 39:19.516
I know_. Me too.
(sniffles)

39:26.860 --> 39:29.658
We need you to stay home
with Henry tonight.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.668
Your dad and I have
some work to do.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.361
You're working tonight?

39:33.400 --> 39:35.197
Have to.

39:41.940 --> 39:43.373
(sighs)

39:45.380 --> 39:46.870
This is excellent.

39:46.910 --> 39:48.514
Mm.

39:48.550 --> 39:50.575
No, seriously.
It's way better than my mom's.

39:50.620 --> 39:53.384
Really?
mm-hmm. Yours is cheesier,

39:53.420 --> 39:55.854
and hers is, like, sometimes
burnt around the edges.

39:55.890 --> 39:57.517
But this is really great.
Mm.

39:57.560 --> 39:59.027
What's your secret?

39:59.060 --> 40:00.925
Well, usually,
I'm in a hurry...
mm-hmm.

40:00.960 --> 40:04.350
So I cook it less time
than it says on the box.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.265
(utensils clinking)

40:08.230 --> 40:10.266
You want me to make you
another one?

40:10.300 --> 40:12.609
No. I have to save room
for dinner.

40:12.640 --> 40:15.279
Good idea.

40:15.310 --> 40:16.902
You should come over
and see my computer.

40:16.940 --> 40:20.103
Oh, you know, I think
I'm done for the night.

40:20.150 --> 40:23.039
Oh. Well, how about
after dinner?

40:23.080 --> 40:24.718
I will.
(dish clatters)

40:24.750 --> 40:26.945
Not tonight,
but, uh, I will.

40:26.990 --> 40:28.719
Soon. Okay?

40:28.760 --> 40:31.115
Okay.
(dish clatters,
faucet running)

40:31.160 --> 40:33.788
Can I ask you a question?

40:33.830 --> 40:35.627
Yeah?

40:35.660 --> 40:39.391
Well, it's about this girl
at school.

40:39.430 --> 40:41.898
Oh.
But it's kind of weird.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.794
Why?

40:43.840 --> 40:45.467
Well, like, honestly?

40:45.510 --> 40:47.603
I mean, yeah. What is this?

40:47.640 --> 40:49.574
She's my teacher.

40:49.610 --> 40:51.749
(laughs)
I'm serious.

40:51.780 --> 40:53.805
Well, what do you want me
to say, Henry?

40:53.850 --> 40:55.408
Well, I mean,
it's not like she's old.

40:55.450 --> 40:56.815
And she's really cute.

40:56.850 --> 40:58.147
Like, how old
do you think she is?

40:58.180 --> 41:00.580
I don't know.
Probably, like 25, 30.

41:00.620 --> 41:02.759
And what subject
does she teach?
SCIence.

41:02.790 --> 41:04.758
You have
a cute saence teacher?
mm-hmm.

41:04.790 --> 41:07.088
Man, are you blessed.
Yeah.

41:07.130 --> 41:09.098
What's her number?

41:09.130 --> 41:10.757
What?
(laughs) No, I'm kidding.

41:10.800 --> 41:13.325
(laughs) No, but -- but, like,
seriously, though, right?

41:13.370 --> 41:16.669
Is there any chance
that she would like me?

41:16.700 --> 41:18.964
Honestly?
Yeah.

41:19.010 --> 41:21.001
No.

41:21.040 --> 41:22.439
Okay.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.334
Hey, what's she look like?

41:24.380 --> 41:26.940
Well, she's got, like...

41:26.980 --> 41:28.845
Oh, and today, she was
wearing this dress, right,

41:28.880 --> 41:30.347
with a zipper up the front.

41:30.380 --> 41:31.813
Holy shit.
Yeah.

41:31.850 --> 41:33.841
I went to school
at the wrong time.

41:33.890 --> 41:36.358
My best-looking teacher
was Miss Graulick.
mm-hmm.

41:36.390 --> 41:38.153
And she had a mustache.

41:38.190 --> 41:40.624
(laughing)
Shaved it every Tuesday.

41:40.660 --> 41:42.196
(laughs)

41:42.230 --> 41:43.959
Hey,
are you wearing cologne?

41:44.000 --> 41:45.524
Yeah. Ralph Lauren.

41:45.570 --> 41:47.697
(smacks lips) Nice.

41:47.730 --> 41:49.288
Yeah, I got a bottle
I bought for Matthew

41:49.340 --> 41:51.137
lying around here somewhere.

41:51.170 --> 41:53.468
It's unopened.
He never wore it.

41:53.510 --> 41:54.875
You want it?
Sure.

41:54.910 --> 41:57.378
I think it's upstairs.
Hold on.

41:57.410 --> 41:58.843
Okay.

42:38.590 --> 42:40.387
Paige?

42:40.420 --> 42:41.887
I'm sorry, mom.

42:41.920 --> 42:44.582
What? What's wrong?

42:44.630 --> 42:47.519
Itold him.

42:47.560 --> 42:50.597
Pastor Tim.
I told him. I'm so sorry.

42:50.630 --> 42:53.098
What did you tell him?

42:53.130 --> 42:56.896
Everything,
about you and --

42:56.940 --> 42:59.363
Ijust -- I didn't know
what to do.

42:59.410 --> 43:01.037
I'm so sorry.
I know that I shouldn't have,

43:01.070 --> 43:02.378
but I just didn't know
what to do.

43:02.410 --> 43:05.868
I'm sorry.
This was the one thing --

43:05.910 --> 43:08.208
the one thing
that you couldn't do.

43:08.250 --> 43:09.774
I know.

43:09.820 --> 43:11.708
Why? I mean,
do you not understand?

43:11.750 --> 43:13.718
Do you not understand
what this means?

43:13.750 --> 43:15.752
I do. I just... (sighs)

43:15.790 --> 43:17.758
(telephone ringing)

43:24.830 --> 43:26.798
Hello?

43:26.830 --> 43:29.390
(sighs) Can you just
please come home?

43:29.440 --> 43:33.228
Just come home, please.

43:33.270 --> 43:34.737
Bye.

43:34.780 --> 43:36.236
(receiver clicks)

43:36.280 --> 43:38.601
I talked to Pastor Tim
about this and --

43:38.650 --> 43:40.777
if I hear one more time
about Pastor Tim --

43:40.810 --> 43:42.277
you have to understand this,
too.

43:42.320 --> 43:45.312
It -- it's not normal.
What was I supposed to do?

43:45.350 --> 43:47.443
You were supposed
to put this family first!

43:47.490 --> 43:48.912
That is what you are
supposed to do!

43:48.960 --> 43:51.827
This is killing me, mom.

43:51.860 --> 43:54.078
It's killing me,
and I can trust him.

43:54.130 --> 43:57.497
We can trust him.
Paige, you have no idea
about anything.

43:57.530 --> 44:00.294
I'm not a liar, mom.
I told you that.

44:00.330 --> 44:03.333
You have no trouble
lying to me.

44:03.370 --> 44:04.928
That's not fair.

44:04.970 --> 44:08.007
You put me in this position.
You did this to me.

44:08.040 --> 44:12.204
Okay. Okay.

44:14.150 --> 44:17.017
We'll figure this out, okay?
We'll figure it out.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.480
(sighs)

44:28.660 --> 44:31.527
(garage door whirring)

44:37.340 --> 44:39.501
(engine stops)

44:46.010 --> 44:49.013
(switch clicks, whirring)

44:55.920 --> 44:59.185
What's going on?
(exhales slowly)

44:59.230 --> 45:01.824
She told me.

45:01.860 --> 45:03.657
She admitted it.

45:03.700 --> 45:05.327
(sighs)

45:05.370 --> 45:07.668
What did you say?

45:07.700 --> 45:11.397
I said, "wait till your father
gets home."

45:13.270 --> 45:15.329
(sighs)

45:15.380 --> 45:18.031
Well, that's it.

45:18.080 --> 45:20.378
She'd certainly
put it all together now.

45:27.220 --> 45:29.552
My mother died.

45:42.570 --> 45:44.458
(sighs)

45:49.780 --> 45:52.248
We're in trouble.

45:55.080 --> 45:57.617
I know.

45:57.650 --> 46:00.778

46:22.810 --> 46:26.598
