00:22.188 --> 00:23.690
Love changes.

00:23.773 --> 00:25.358
It does not.

00:26.943 --> 00:28.069
Eun-seong.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.154
Eun-seong!

00:29.237 --> 00:30.488
Ji-hun.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.759
My child ripped the picture by mistake.

00:51.092 --> 00:52.343
My husband's going to kill me.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.221
Hello, Mr. Han.

00:55.764 --> 00:56.765
Hello.

00:57.932 --> 00:59.059
Eun-seong!

01:04.064 --> 01:05.190
Does she work here?

01:07.067 --> 01:08.693
She's an assistant chef at my restaurant.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.071
Did you see that picture just now?

01:11.988 --> 01:13.198
What picture?

01:13.281 --> 01:15.533
The man looked a lot like you.

01:15.617 --> 01:16.868
What do you mean?

01:17.285 --> 01:19.746
What picture? Who looks like me?

01:21.164 --> 01:23.500
Never mind. I must've seen wrong.

01:25.251 --> 01:26.294
Eun-seong!

01:29.172 --> 01:30.173
Eun-seong!

01:30.256 --> 01:31.299
Why you...

01:35.136 --> 01:36.387
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.556
I'm sorry.

01:43.144 --> 01:44.145
Let's go.

01:45.605 --> 01:46.564
Let's go home.

01:50.735 --> 01:51.986
Where were you going alone?

01:54.072 --> 01:54.989
Tell me.

02:03.873 --> 02:05.375
Enjoy.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.003
Your restaurant is nice.

02:09.629 --> 02:12.966
I didn't think you and business
would mesh well together.

02:13.758 --> 02:17.053
This place is already known to be
the hot spot in the area.

02:17.887 --> 02:18.847
Thanks.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.852
But about that worker earlier...

02:26.271 --> 02:28.231
Does she bring her kid to work?

02:30.233 --> 02:31.901
You didn't come to talk about that.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.695
What's up?

02:35.738 --> 02:38.366
Does something need to be up
for me to come?

02:39.117 --> 02:40.660
Why are you being so stiff?

02:40.743 --> 02:42.453
I'm not being stiff.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.330
I'm a busy man.

02:44.747 --> 02:47.667
It's rude to just drop in
without a heads up.

02:50.211 --> 02:51.462
I came because I missed you.

02:51.921 --> 02:53.047
Is that wrong?

03:02.223 --> 03:03.474
This is Seungjin Hospital.

03:03.558 --> 03:06.185
I've e-mailed you the schedule
for the follow-up interview.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.604
Please bring your child with you.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.148
Ji-hun.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.445
I have an urgent meeting to get to.

03:15.528 --> 03:16.779
I need to go to the head office.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.364
I'll see you later.

03:19.574 --> 03:20.742
Ji-hun.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.380
From now on,

03:34.464 --> 03:36.007
please refrain

03:36.966 --> 03:38.218
from coming here.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.596
I don't have enough time
to entertain family guests.

03:54.442 --> 03:55.443
Eun-seong,

03:56.319 --> 03:57.862
do you hate that man that much?

03:58.321 --> 04:00.406
Do you like that man that much?

04:02.700 --> 04:03.826
Yes.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.745
What do you like?

04:05.954 --> 04:08.998
He's always saying, "Listen to me,"

04:09.332 --> 04:12.585
and always yelling and saying mean things.

04:13.127 --> 04:14.379
Still.

04:14.462 --> 04:17.674
Even if he yells and says mean things,
it doesn't mean he's a bad person.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.217
That's silly.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.636
You always tell me to say nice things.

04:22.679 --> 04:23.930
That's true,

04:24.931 --> 04:29.477
but he isn't totally
a bad person after all.

04:30.311 --> 04:33.481
At first, I also thought he was a bad man,

04:33.648 --> 04:35.275
but I realized he wasn't.

04:35.608 --> 04:36.859
He may yell,

04:37.110 --> 04:40.071
but he has a soft and kind heart.

04:40.321 --> 04:41.990
He's not soft and kind.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.242
Eun-seong.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.869
You know that cat that you like?

04:47.203 --> 04:49.414
What does he do when he's scared?

04:49.580 --> 04:50.832
If he's scared,

04:51.708 --> 04:53.584
he cries like this.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.503
Right?

04:55.628 --> 04:59.299
People cry like that cat
when they're scared too.

05:00.049 --> 05:02.051
He yells because he's scared,

05:02.135 --> 05:04.512
but he's very soft and kind on the inside.

05:05.346 --> 05:06.597
For example,

05:06.931 --> 05:08.808
thanks to him, I paid back money

05:08.891 --> 05:11.185
to those really scary men.

05:11.269 --> 05:14.564
Thanks to him, we have a home
where we're living now.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.275
He's actually done a lot for us
if you think about it.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.652
Still, I don't like him.

05:19.861 --> 05:20.862
Eun-seong.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.071
Eun-seong!

05:26.993 --> 05:28.578
Did your guest leave already?

05:33.499 --> 05:34.751
Did the hospital text you?

05:35.084 --> 05:36.085
Pardon?

05:37.503 --> 05:38.755
They'll text you

05:39.213 --> 05:40.465
about interviewing Eun-seong.

05:41.090 --> 05:43.926
I'll take care of it, so don't worry.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.387
How?

05:47.513 --> 05:49.265
We need to pass the test.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.060
They won't fail us for that.

05:53.686 --> 05:54.979
I'll handle it.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.648
Stop working on the kid. It may backfire.

05:58.691 --> 05:59.984
She hates me so much.

06:00.359 --> 06:01.944
It'll only be trouble if we take her.

06:02.612 --> 06:03.863
You're a good dancer.

06:04.322 --> 06:05.573
Where are your parents?

06:06.282 --> 06:07.533
Over there.

06:08.701 --> 06:09.952
Is that your dad?

06:10.912 --> 06:12.497
He isn't my dad!

06:13.331 --> 06:14.415
Eun-seong!

06:15.124 --> 06:16.375
I'm sorry.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.177
Have you heard anything?

06:26.761 --> 06:28.763
-About what?
-Ji-hun.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.307
Are you sure he isn't seeing someone?

06:31.516 --> 06:34.352
He switches girls every three days.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.062
That's his joy in life.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.314
Why would he want to get married?

06:38.397 --> 06:40.233
But still,

06:40.358 --> 06:42.401
he's not one to disobey me.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.029
Something is definitely going on.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.325
What's wrong? Do you not have an appetite?

06:50.701 --> 06:52.453
You don't look well lately.

06:53.830 --> 06:54.956
Let me excuse myself.

07:03.047 --> 07:04.298
Jeong-hun.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.426
Jeong-hun. What's wrong?

07:08.177 --> 07:09.554
Are you feeling sick?

07:10.179 --> 07:11.347
No.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.724
You wanted to go golfing with Na-yoon.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.268
What happened to that?

07:15.935 --> 07:17.061
What's wrong?

07:17.478 --> 07:18.729
Did you two fight?

07:20.440 --> 07:21.774
She's seeing someone else.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.443
She wants to break up with me.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.237
What?

07:27.822 --> 07:29.782
Wait. Jeong-hun.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.662
-The person you are trying to reach
-What's going on?

07:34.745 --> 07:38.124
-cannot answer the phone.
-Where has she gone?

07:41.377 --> 07:42.837
Where's your mom?

07:43.004 --> 07:44.464
Why can't I reach her?

07:44.797 --> 07:45.798
She...

07:45.882 --> 07:47.425
She went on a trip.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.677
What trip? Where?

07:51.471 --> 07:53.264
For about two months

07:54.432 --> 07:55.516
to Europe...

07:56.017 --> 07:57.977
Yes, Santiago in Europe.

07:58.394 --> 08:00.813
She went on a walking trip for two months.

08:01.814 --> 08:05.026
What trip is this? I spoke with her
a few days ago and she had a cold.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.987
She had promised a friend
from a while ago.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.864
Your mom has no friends!

08:10.114 --> 08:12.783
She's acting strange,
as if she's about to die.

08:13.242 --> 08:15.536
She hated walking
even in the neighborhood.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.246
What? A walking trip?

08:18.706 --> 08:20.750
Why are you suddenly asking for her?

08:20.917 --> 08:22.919
I thought it was better for you
if she didn't contact you.

08:23.002 --> 08:23.961
Forget it.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.296
Anyway,

08:25.755 --> 08:27.632
when will you have time?

08:28.716 --> 08:30.343
I'm sorry.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.678
I have a meeting with investors tonight.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.263
Push it back and come out.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.307
I can't push it back.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.477
I'm in the middle of a meeting right now.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.145
I'll call you back.

08:46.442 --> 08:47.568
Gosh.

09:12.468 --> 09:13.719
Ms. Oh!

09:13.928 --> 09:15.179
Ms. Oh.

09:15.429 --> 09:16.681
Are you okay?

09:16.764 --> 09:18.015
-Are you okay?
-Let go.

09:19.809 --> 09:20.768
Ms. Oh!

09:20.851 --> 09:22.436
Let go of me. Let go!

09:23.271 --> 09:24.522
Ms. Oh!

09:25.439 --> 09:26.440
Let go.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.901
-Please.
-Then go with me.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.570
I'll die with you.

09:33.864 --> 09:35.741
If you die, I die.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.535
If you die,

09:37.910 --> 09:39.495
I'll die too.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.165
You need to live for me to live.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.085
Ma'am,

09:46.502 --> 09:48.296
I want to live like crazy.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.841
I really want to live like crazy.

09:53.342 --> 09:54.594
Ms. Oh, please...

09:56.095 --> 09:57.555
We should both live.

09:59.515 --> 10:01.809
Living is still better, isn't it?

10:03.019 --> 10:05.521
Even if it's a pathetic life,
living is still better.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.820
Why do I want to save you so badly?

10:17.992 --> 10:20.578
Do I need to say this myself?

10:25.082 --> 10:26.334
Because you're family.

10:27.251 --> 10:28.711
You're my only family.

10:29.503 --> 10:30.630
Got it?

10:46.562 --> 10:47.563
Ma'am.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.398
Try some of this.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.235
Think of your son and daughter-in-law.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.241
You need to become stronger.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.786
If you don't eat anything,

11:01.994 --> 11:04.121
how will you get surgery?

11:04.789 --> 11:07.416
Ma'am, please eat a little.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.006
Later.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.466
I'll eat later.

11:15.549 --> 11:17.385
Goodness.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.770
THE PROMISE

11:51.043 --> 11:52.086
This is Seungjin Hospital.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.880
I've e-mailed you the schedule
for the follow-up interview.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.298
Please bring your child with you.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.016
DAD

12:26.328 --> 12:27.746
I need to talk to you.

12:27.830 --> 12:28.956
Come in.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.294
I can't stay long. Eun-seong is asleep.

12:33.836 --> 12:37.047
I got the text from the hospital
to come for the interview tomorrow.

12:37.381 --> 12:38.757
We already talked about that.

12:38.924 --> 12:39.925
No.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.760
Can't we push it back a little?

12:42.178 --> 12:44.263
I'll convince Eun-seong somehow.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.516
How will you do that?

12:48.142 --> 12:49.435
And didn't you say

12:49.768 --> 12:51.729
you didn't want to hurt her?

12:51.812 --> 12:53.063
We've come this far.

12:53.147 --> 12:55.357
I think it's right to try whatever we can.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.651
Getting the surgery is more important.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.904
It's more important to save your mom.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.032
Are you that afraid

13:03.240 --> 13:04.492
I'll ask for the money back?

13:04.909 --> 13:06.160
Forget it.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.536
I'll handle it.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.871
Don't worry.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.540
They'll suspect us more if we push off
the interview any longer.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.793
You should go.
You said Eun-seong is sleeping.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.255
Who is it?

13:29.141 --> 13:30.476
Why are you here at this hour?

13:30.559 --> 13:32.394
May I come in?

13:35.523 --> 13:36.607
Let's go out.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.359
Don't push me away anymore.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.319
I came to talk to you.

13:44.114 --> 13:45.824
Let's go. What if someone sees?

13:45.908 --> 13:47.660
Let go!

13:48.285 --> 13:50.204
I don't care about that stuff anymore.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.332
Have you been drinking?

13:53.582 --> 13:54.833
Yes.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.752
I had a bottle of wine.

13:58.837 --> 14:01.423
I drank at your restaurant a bit earlier.

14:03.759 --> 14:05.844
Hearing you say not to come
made me want to come more.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.682
Stop pushing me away, Ji-hun.

14:12.601 --> 14:15.563
I am no longer your future sister-in-law.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.440
I'm breaking up with your brother.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.318
You're drunk.

14:21.485 --> 14:22.611
No.

14:24.446 --> 14:25.739
I'm not drunk.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.200
You know how much I can drink.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.119
We drank together many times.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.455
Did you forget already,
just because it's been a few years?

14:38.586 --> 14:39.879
Let's go. I'll take you home.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.463
Let go.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.134
Let me check just one thing first.

14:48.429 --> 14:49.680
Ji-hun,

14:50.681 --> 14:52.641
do you no longer have feelings for me?

14:56.812 --> 14:58.314
See? You can't answer me.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.362
Can't we start over?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.628
-Let's go.
-What are you so afraid of?

15:21.045 --> 15:22.755
Why are you still so insecure?

15:22.838 --> 15:24.131
Let's talk when you're sober!

15:24.214 --> 15:26.216
I told you, I'm not drunk!

15:27.468 --> 15:28.719
I'm...

15:28.844 --> 15:31.805
I'm ready. It's up to you to decide.

15:32.222 --> 15:34.183
What are you afraid of? Your dad?

15:35.851 --> 15:37.561
-Leave.
-Let go!

15:41.106 --> 15:42.358
Fine.

15:44.401 --> 15:45.736
I'll leave on my own.

15:57.539 --> 15:58.791
Na-yoon.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.466
We've met before, haven't we?

16:08.175 --> 16:09.343
The thing is...

16:09.426 --> 16:10.886
This isn't...

16:11.095 --> 16:13.347
I guess I was right about the picture.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.599
No, there's a misunderstanding.

16:17.643 --> 16:18.894
You're right.

16:20.187 --> 16:21.480
It's me in that picture.

16:22.356 --> 16:25.067
This is my girlfriend, Kang Hye-su.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.568
We're engaged.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.199
Sorry for not introducing you sooner.

16:32.866 --> 16:34.201
I had my reasons.

16:36.745 --> 16:37.997
Excuse me.

16:38.914 --> 16:41.208
Wait, please...

16:42.042 --> 16:43.085
Wait.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.795
Wait...

16:45.004 --> 16:46.255
Let her go.

16:52.553 --> 16:53.595
Go stop her.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.514
Go tell her the entire truth!

16:55.597 --> 16:57.099
-If not, I will.
-Stop it!

16:57.182 --> 16:58.600
It isn't true!

16:58.767 --> 17:00.644
You'll regret letting her go like this.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.146
You should mind your own business.

17:07.651 --> 17:08.902
No.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.279
I can't stay out of it.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.490
I overheard.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.284
She's your ex-girlfriend, isn't she?

17:15.659 --> 17:16.910
The one in the photos.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.581
I don't know how it ended up this way,

17:21.415 --> 17:23.751
but I know you're not over her.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.336
So go after her.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.880
What do you know?

17:29.798 --> 17:34.178
I was forced to study a lot
about you, Mr. Han.

17:34.636 --> 17:36.180
The place you had your first date.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.057
First birthday present.

17:38.348 --> 17:39.808
First time you confessed your love.

17:42.603 --> 17:43.854
It was all about her.

17:45.314 --> 17:46.982
Start over with her.

17:47.483 --> 17:50.527
If you tell her everything about me
and ask her to understand,

17:51.153 --> 17:52.905
I'm sure she will.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.577
Don't do anything you'll regret.

18:00.746 --> 18:01.830
Everything...

18:03.165 --> 18:05.042
depends on that one moment.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.588
If you miss that moment,

18:10.881 --> 18:12.591
you'll never get a chance again.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.512
I never...

18:17.888 --> 18:20.015
once thanked my husband

18:21.016 --> 18:23.727
or told him that I loved him
before he died.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.689
You have no idea how much I regret it.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.068
I always got angry at him

18:31.151 --> 18:33.612
because I felt inadequate
and like a loser.

18:34.154 --> 18:35.614
I only pushed him away.

18:35.697 --> 18:37.241
Hold on!

18:39.576 --> 18:40.911
Can you stop?

18:40.994 --> 18:42.496
Why are you so nosy?

18:42.579 --> 18:44.623
Do you enjoy butting
into other people's lives?

18:51.713 --> 18:53.423
Just stick to your role.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.385
Don't be confused
and think you really are my wife.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.388
Just perform according to the contract.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.014
Got it?

19:50.105 --> 19:52.649
THE PROMISE

20:08.624 --> 20:09.875
What are you doing?

20:10.417 --> 20:11.710
Nothing.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.003
Go back to sleep.

20:15.255 --> 20:16.757
What are you looking at?

20:20.469 --> 20:21.720
Eun-seong.

20:22.596 --> 20:23.847
What?

20:24.139 --> 20:26.099
Are you going to talk
about that man again?

20:26.808 --> 20:28.060
No.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.231
I'm not sure about him anymore either.

20:33.148 --> 20:35.108
That temper...

20:39.446 --> 20:40.697
Let's go

20:41.281 --> 20:42.741
see your dad today.

20:43.367 --> 20:46.536
Let's show him how big you've gotten

20:46.870 --> 20:48.580
and leave a picture for him

20:48.914 --> 20:51.166
so that he can look at it
whenever he misses you.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.711
Which should we print?

20:56.171 --> 20:57.422
Which one?

20:58.507 --> 21:00.259
This came out the best, right?

21:00.342 --> 21:01.593
You have a big smile.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.346
Why are we going to see Dad suddenly?

21:04.429 --> 21:06.431
Are you going to tell him
that I have a new dad?

21:08.225 --> 21:09.601
That's not it.

21:10.477 --> 21:13.355
It's the day that we go to see your dad.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.441
It's been too long, hasn't it?

21:18.610 --> 21:21.989
Your dad will be so shocked to see
how big you've gotten.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.575
He doesn't even know what I look like.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.537
He passed away before I was born.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.206
How would he know how much I've grown?

21:31.290 --> 21:32.541
What?

21:32.916 --> 21:35.585
Why wouldn't he know what you look like?

21:35.877 --> 21:38.297
He can see everything from heaven.

21:38.547 --> 21:41.466
He can even see you pick your nose.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.634
Like this.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.137
Come on. Let's pick a picture.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.597
Which one should we use?

21:49.266 --> 21:50.434
This one?

21:50.517 --> 21:51.977
Not this one.

21:55.188 --> 21:57.899
I looked better before I lost my teeth.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.651
Really? This one?

21:59.735 --> 22:01.528
-Yes.
-Okay, then kiss.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.364
Okay.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.533
I like the one without your teeth.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.119
It's cute.

22:16.501 --> 22:23.508
CHA SEOK-HWAN

22:25.343 --> 22:26.845
Isn't Eun-seong so big now?

22:28.096 --> 22:29.598
I brought her picture.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.558
Look at it whenever you want.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.040
Seok-hwan.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.213
I need courage.

23:07.969 --> 23:11.181
You left the two of us alone,

23:14.518 --> 23:15.894
so you have to protect us.

23:18.396 --> 23:19.648
Okay?

23:25.070 --> 23:26.196
Eun-seong, what are you doing?

23:26.279 --> 23:27.739
Come say hi to your dad.

23:31.284 --> 23:32.577
Let's give this to your dad.

23:32.661 --> 23:33.912
Okay.

23:35.080 --> 23:39.167
Here we go. Okay.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.838
Isn't Eun-seong so big?

23:42.921 --> 23:44.214
Look how tall she is.

23:44.464 --> 23:45.924
Look how many teeth she lost.

23:46.925 --> 23:50.095
Say something to him, Eun-seong.

23:51.304 --> 23:53.348
-Should we tell him we miss him?
-Yes.

23:54.015 --> 23:55.767
Tell him you miss him.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.769
I miss you, Dad.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.652
I miss you.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.364
I miss you.

24:13.326 --> 24:15.036
I miss you.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.549
Let's go.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.718
-Okay.
-Say, "Bye-bye."

24:30.260 --> 24:31.595
Bye-bye.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.556
Bye.

24:35.015 --> 24:36.266
We'll come back.

24:38.643 --> 24:39.895
-Let's go.
-Okay.

25:12.802 --> 25:14.054
Mom.

25:16.389 --> 25:17.641
Mom?

25:18.600 --> 25:19.601
Yes?

25:19.684 --> 25:20.936
Were you crying?

25:24.022 --> 25:27.025
No. Why would I cry?

25:27.192 --> 25:28.443
I didn't cry.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.279
The truth is...

25:32.447 --> 25:35.408
I miss your dad a little bit.

25:36.534 --> 25:38.662
I don't miss Dad at all.

25:39.537 --> 25:40.789
Why not?

25:40.914 --> 25:43.708
He looks down from heaven.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.293
Why does he do that?

25:46.044 --> 25:47.587
Dad doesn't know anything.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.756
You're crying this much,

25:49.839 --> 25:51.383
but he's ignoring you.

25:52.425 --> 25:53.677
He doesn't know

25:53.760 --> 25:55.470
that I lost my teeth

25:55.762 --> 25:58.348
or that I can jump rope ten times.

25:59.766 --> 26:01.017
He knows nothing.

26:01.101 --> 26:02.352
Dad is a dummy!

26:05.438 --> 26:06.773
Come on.

26:06.982 --> 26:10.652
Just marry that man, Mom.

26:11.695 --> 26:12.737
What?

26:12.821 --> 26:14.656
You said that man isn't bad.

26:15.365 --> 26:16.658
You said he only yells,

26:16.741 --> 26:17.993
but he isn't bad.

26:20.328 --> 26:21.579
Fine.

26:21.788 --> 26:23.039
Fine!

26:23.581 --> 26:25.709
I'll like him for you.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.419
Okay?

26:30.380 --> 26:31.631
Marry him.

26:34.759 --> 26:36.177
I'm sorry, Eun-seong.

26:36.553 --> 26:37.804
For what?

26:42.976 --> 26:44.227
Just everything.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.521
It's okay.

26:49.941 --> 26:51.818
I'm so sorry.

27:03.496 --> 27:05.040
You cutie-pie.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.048
My nose is running.

27:15.467 --> 27:16.718
Did you cry too, Eun-seong?

27:26.311 --> 27:27.562
Mr. Han!

27:28.646 --> 27:29.898
I heard

27:30.273 --> 27:31.941
the kid won't listen.

27:32.108 --> 27:35.445
Gosh. That little runt is so stubborn.

27:36.196 --> 27:37.322
Goodness.

27:37.530 --> 27:38.782
What will you do?

27:38.990 --> 27:40.533
What will you tell the hospital?

27:40.909 --> 27:43.370
You couldn't win over one little kid?

27:43.453 --> 27:44.788
At that age,

27:44.871 --> 27:46.373
you can win them over with candy.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.000
Do you want to get hit?

27:51.461 --> 27:52.462
Anyway,

27:52.545 --> 27:54.839
Hye-su took the day off.

27:55.298 --> 27:57.133
You didn't go with her?

27:57.467 --> 27:58.426
I'm leaving.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.305
That little...

28:02.972 --> 28:04.224
He's so violent.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.267
Why does he have to fight so well?

28:06.643 --> 28:09.521
Goodness. If only I took a boxing class.

28:10.063 --> 28:11.314
Gosh.

28:11.731 --> 28:12.774
SEUNGJIN HOSPITAL

28:12.857 --> 28:14.818
You couldn't bring the child?

28:15.068 --> 28:18.238
Must you really meet our young child?

28:18.863 --> 28:20.407
Are you that suspicious of us?

28:20.573 --> 28:22.200
Why couldn't you bring her?

28:24.494 --> 28:25.620
Why?

28:31.793 --> 28:33.044
Actually,

28:34.003 --> 28:35.338
we don't get along.

28:37.382 --> 28:38.800
I lied that day.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.051
I couldn't admit

28:40.135 --> 28:42.721
that I couldn't win her over
after dating for two years.

28:42.804 --> 28:44.055
It was too embarrassing.

28:45.765 --> 28:47.142
I'll tell you the truth.

28:47.642 --> 28:48.727
She hates me.

28:48.810 --> 28:50.103
She won't accept me as her dad.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.063
I felt too bad

28:52.147 --> 28:54.858
both for her and for my wife
to drag her here.

28:55.734 --> 28:56.985
I just don't think

28:57.360 --> 28:59.028
I can bring her.

28:59.696 --> 29:02.157
I'll do anything else that you request.

29:02.282 --> 29:03.950
I'll submit anything you ask for.

29:08.913 --> 29:10.290
Please let it go.

29:11.958 --> 29:14.794
But I...

29:14.919 --> 29:17.839
I'll submit a request for approval
to the head office,

29:18.006 --> 29:20.675
but I can't guarantee
that it will go through.

29:20.925 --> 29:22.343
I'll see you again.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.137
Excuse me.

29:28.433 --> 29:29.976
Can't you go easy on us?

29:31.019 --> 29:32.729
Can't you be understanding? You're a man!

29:32.812 --> 29:34.522
Are you getting mad at me?

29:34.606 --> 29:35.732
Ji-hun.

29:37.734 --> 29:40.111
I'm sorry we're late. I brought Eun-seong.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.238
Say hello.

29:43.114 --> 29:44.657
Hello.

29:46.576 --> 29:48.286
Are you Eun-seong?

29:48.411 --> 29:49.537
Yes.

29:49.954 --> 29:53.124
Eun-seong, do you know this man?

29:53.374 --> 29:56.336
Yes. He's going to marry my mom.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.714
He's going to be my dad.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.517
-Shall we talk inside?
-No, it's okay.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.602
It's fine. I'll submit it for approval.

30:12.685 --> 30:14.270
At first, I knew

30:14.354 --> 30:16.564
I was asking for too much as well.

30:16.773 --> 30:19.442
-But let me give you some advice--
-Get back to work.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.365
Don't we need to do the interview?
Did things work out?

30:25.573 --> 30:27.408
I told you I'd handle it.

30:29.369 --> 30:30.495
Eun-seong.

30:30.578 --> 30:31.871
Did you go to the day care center?

30:33.164 --> 30:34.457
I'm going now.

30:36.209 --> 30:37.794
Why did you bring her?

30:37.877 --> 30:39.295
You even pulled her out of day care.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.965
Eun-seong, let's go.

30:42.882 --> 30:44.384
I'm going with Mom.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.011
Let's go.

30:49.430 --> 30:50.682
You did good.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.350
My good girl.

30:52.892 --> 30:54.352
-Let's go.
-Let's go!

30:56.354 --> 30:57.355
Let's go.

31:01.484 --> 31:03.403
Eun-seong, stop running! You'll fall!

31:03.486 --> 31:04.737
Eun-seong!

31:07.699 --> 31:08.908
Are you here for your test?

31:08.992 --> 31:11.703
Yes, but I want to get some air first.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.288
Ma'am.

31:13.746 --> 31:15.206
Got you.

31:15.623 --> 31:16.875
Seriously.

31:19.210 --> 31:20.753
-Let's go.
-Okay.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.507
Here.

31:25.758 --> 31:27.010
Okay.

31:28.344 --> 31:29.470
Goodbye.

31:29.554 --> 31:30.805
Let's go.

31:31.389 --> 31:32.640
Let's go.

31:39.105 --> 31:40.356
Hello.

31:42.108 --> 31:43.776
Why did you come here?

31:44.110 --> 31:45.528
We had an interview.

31:46.154 --> 31:47.405
Eun-seong, say hello.

31:47.572 --> 31:48.823
Who is she?

31:55.121 --> 31:56.497
How old is she?

31:58.750 --> 32:00.084
I'll get it.

32:00.168 --> 32:01.127
Okay.

32:02.045 --> 32:03.671
How do you feel?

32:04.047 --> 32:05.673
You got really wet from the rain that day.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.550
If I die,

32:08.426 --> 32:10.011
you said you'd die too.

32:11.220 --> 32:12.472
What did you mean?

32:14.015 --> 32:15.141
Pardon?

32:15.224 --> 32:18.227
I can tell how you live
just by looking at you.

32:19.145 --> 32:21.522
Why do you want to live so badly?

32:25.026 --> 32:26.277
Is it because of the kid?

32:28.071 --> 32:29.948
The thing is...

32:30.531 --> 32:31.783
Forget it.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.242
Don't tell me.

32:34.702 --> 32:36.579
I don't want to hear anything.

32:37.330 --> 32:39.624
I don't care about your situation.

32:42.335 --> 32:44.253
I won't thank you either.

32:45.838 --> 32:47.131
It's not like

32:47.590 --> 32:49.550
you're doing it for free anyway.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.472
What we're doing...

32:56.307 --> 32:58.893
You can't let anyone know.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.437
Nobody can know.

33:01.562 --> 33:02.814
You know that, right?

33:03.356 --> 33:04.607
I know.

33:05.566 --> 33:08.486
We signed the contract
and put our seals on it.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.281
You signed a contract?

33:12.865 --> 33:14.117
Yes.

33:16.494 --> 33:17.829
-Drink.
-Okay.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.501
How old is she?

33:23.835 --> 33:25.253
-She's--
-I'm seven.

33:28.381 --> 33:29.716
You look young.

33:29.882 --> 33:31.801
Why did you get married so soon?

33:32.301 --> 33:33.553
What about your husband?

33:34.220 --> 33:35.471
Well...

33:36.305 --> 33:38.891
It's okay. Why do I bother asking?

33:39.058 --> 33:40.393
Don't answer.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.811
I'll go.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.361
My son's life is

33:50.695 --> 33:52.947
at stake here.

33:54.157 --> 33:56.200
You must keep it a secret.

33:56.534 --> 33:57.869
Don't worry, ma'am.

34:19.599 --> 34:21.267
Gosh.

34:23.311 --> 34:24.937
Where did you go?

34:25.980 --> 34:28.107
Why? Did you think I went to die?

34:28.191 --> 34:29.442
Mom.

34:31.611 --> 34:34.280
You really want to mess with me
until the end, don't you?

34:34.363 --> 34:35.573
Please.

34:35.656 --> 34:36.657
Mom!

34:36.741 --> 34:38.743
Okay! Fine!

34:39.118 --> 34:41.579
I'll do that pathetic thing
so that I can live

34:41.704 --> 34:43.623
and be your shameless mother!

34:45.041 --> 34:46.793
Don't regret it later.

34:47.001 --> 34:49.295
From now on, I won't ask about you

34:49.504 --> 34:51.005
or that woman.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.007
And I won't look back.

35:15.530 --> 35:17.365
What is this? Isn't this Eun-seong?

35:20.326 --> 35:21.536
Where did you get this?

35:22.245 --> 35:23.496
Did you see Hye-su?

35:23.788 --> 35:24.997
No.

35:25.081 --> 35:26.332
I'm going to.

35:27.041 --> 35:28.709
What's gotten into you?

35:29.710 --> 35:31.170
Where did you get this?

35:31.712 --> 35:34.549
She left that picture
in Seok-hwan's niche,

35:34.632 --> 35:36.259
so I took it.

35:36.926 --> 35:39.053
I saw her from afar.

35:40.513 --> 35:42.265
She looked just like

35:42.390 --> 35:44.225
her dad when he was young.

35:45.434 --> 35:47.019
She really must have her dad's genes.

35:47.103 --> 35:49.689
I told you to meet her
and you kept ignoring me.

35:52.275 --> 35:53.693
I packed some socks

35:53.776 --> 35:55.069
and some underwear.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.280
I'm going to give these to her and leave.

35:57.530 --> 35:58.781
Don't go.

35:59.031 --> 36:00.158
Don't bother.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.201
You told me to go.

36:02.285 --> 36:03.327
What's the point?

36:03.411 --> 36:06.038
You're going to give her underwear
after giving her a hard time?

36:07.165 --> 36:08.666
If that's the case, don't bother.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.042
Whatever.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.210
I just want to see the kid.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.295
Don't go.

36:12.378 --> 36:14.088
What's wrong with you?

36:15.006 --> 36:16.924
You'll just get in the way.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.093
She has a boyfriend now.

36:19.927 --> 36:21.596
Let her be happy.

36:21.804 --> 36:24.348
Just ignore her, as you have been.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.984
The person you are trying
to reach cannot answer...

36:35.401 --> 36:36.777
What trip?

36:37.236 --> 36:38.571
Oh Mi-ran.

36:38.738 --> 36:40.573
You're angry with me, is that it?

36:59.425 --> 37:00.676
Hello?

37:00.760 --> 37:01.761
It's me.

37:02.261 --> 37:03.763
Are you free tomorrow?

37:05.014 --> 37:06.265
I'm sorry,

37:06.641 --> 37:07.892
but tomorrow...

37:09.977 --> 37:11.229
Tomorrow,

37:11.687 --> 37:14.357
I have a magazine shoot
for the restaurant promotion.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.400
Why do they need you for that?

37:17.777 --> 37:19.612
I'm the fool for asking.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.114
Of course, you need to be there. Sure.

37:22.198 --> 37:24.325
You'll probably continue to make up plans
to get out of this.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.577
Fine. Do whatever you want.

37:33.501 --> 37:36.420
I can't just let Ji-hun do
whatever he wants.

37:36.629 --> 37:39.340
Ji-hun isn't the problem right now.

37:39.423 --> 37:40.508
This is bad.

37:40.591 --> 37:41.717
What is?

37:42.593 --> 37:44.553
Jeong-hun's engagement may be called off.

37:44.637 --> 37:45.721
What do you mean?

37:45.805 --> 37:48.015
He says Na-yoon wants to break up.

37:48.849 --> 37:51.143
Is she out of her mind?

37:51.686 --> 37:53.479
How dare she?

37:54.063 --> 37:55.314
Loser.

37:55.523 --> 37:56.857
It's obvious

37:57.483 --> 37:58.818
Jeong-hun did something stupid.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.404
-Honey.
-Leave them alone.

38:01.570 --> 38:04.282
Even his first wife left him
in less than a month.

38:04.490 --> 38:06.701
Why is that his fault?

38:06.909 --> 38:08.703
He just got unlucky with the girl.

38:09.495 --> 38:12.873
How could something like this happen
before that wound could even heal?

38:15.209 --> 38:16.335
Honey.

38:16.419 --> 38:19.588
I think you'll have to step in.

38:19.839 --> 38:22.591
I have only two kids,

38:22.758 --> 38:25.136
and they both disgrace me.

38:25.553 --> 38:28.597
That's just great.

38:28.931 --> 38:30.057
Goodness.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.061
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

38:34.729 --> 38:35.771
Yes.

38:35.855 --> 38:38.482
I have to work late
because we suddenly got a big group.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.776
Can you pick up Eun-seong
and watch her for a bit?

38:40.860 --> 38:41.902
Are you very busy?

38:41.986 --> 38:43.237
Sorry.

38:43.446 --> 38:45.489
I can't make it today either.

38:45.573 --> 38:49.368
It's my mom's birthday,
so we're having dinner together.

38:49.952 --> 38:50.911
It's okay.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.455
I'll find a way.

38:53.247 --> 38:55.458
Wish your mom a happy birthday.

38:55.875 --> 38:57.126
Okay.

39:00.629 --> 39:03.090
Hello, this is Eun-seong's mom.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.383
I'm so sorry,

39:04.467 --> 39:07.553
but could you watch Eun-seong for a bit
after the all-day class?

39:07.636 --> 39:09.847
I'm going to be late today.

39:10.639 --> 39:11.849
What are you doing?

39:11.932 --> 39:13.642
I'm coming!

39:14.435 --> 39:15.603
I'm sorry.

39:15.686 --> 39:18.105
Yes. Can you watch her just for today?

39:18.189 --> 39:19.857
I'm sorry. Just a little bit.

39:20.274 --> 39:22.401
Can you watch her just for today?

39:22.485 --> 39:23.736
I'll get her.

39:25.446 --> 39:26.697
Excuse me.

39:28.866 --> 39:30.659
I'll pick up Eun-seong.

39:30.910 --> 39:32.787
-It's not--
-Do you have other options?

39:33.037 --> 39:34.121
You don't.

39:34.205 --> 39:37.291
Just work while you're working.
Don't think about other things.

39:43.297 --> 39:49.595
SOCKS FOR SALE

39:50.554 --> 39:51.806
My poor...

39:54.683 --> 39:56.435
My poor Seok-hwan.

39:59.897 --> 40:01.148
My baby.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.484
My baby.

40:07.988 --> 40:09.240
Seok-hwan,

40:11.242 --> 40:12.743
what was the rush?

40:12.993 --> 40:14.703
Why did you go so soon?

40:17.748 --> 40:20.251
You didn't get to see
your daughter grow up.

40:58.539 --> 40:59.665
Who are you?

40:59.748 --> 41:01.125
I came for Eun-seong.

41:01.208 --> 41:03.627
Yes. Her mom just called.

41:03.711 --> 41:04.962
-Come in.
-Thank you.

41:08.048 --> 41:09.300
Eun-seong.

41:11.218 --> 41:12.720
Did you draw something nice?

41:12.803 --> 41:14.054
Get up.

41:14.346 --> 41:15.848
Let's go.

41:17.641 --> 41:19.894
Hi. Your mom was busy.

41:21.437 --> 41:22.688
Is he your dad?

41:23.022 --> 41:25.024
No, he's just someone we know.

41:37.369 --> 41:38.662
Wait for me.

41:41.790 --> 41:43.667
Do you always stay this late?

41:44.126 --> 41:45.961
Only when Mom is late.

41:48.923 --> 41:50.299
Is it fun at the day care center?

41:51.467 --> 41:53.886
Is the restaurant fun?

41:54.803 --> 41:56.013
Hey.

41:56.388 --> 41:57.723
Who works for fun?

41:57.806 --> 42:00.267
I don't go for fun either.

42:00.726 --> 42:02.436
But you play every day.

42:02.770 --> 42:04.688
I have lots of problems to deal with.

42:05.147 --> 42:07.066
I have lots of problems too.

42:07.775 --> 42:09.026
You do?

42:09.151 --> 42:10.402
Like what?

42:10.736 --> 42:12.571
The younger kids from the baby class

42:12.905 --> 42:14.156
are always causing trouble.

42:15.407 --> 42:18.118
The teacher tells me to eat spinach,
which I hate.

42:18.994 --> 42:21.038
I have plenty of problems.

42:21.455 --> 42:23.040
Right.

42:25.209 --> 42:26.460
Mister.

42:27.002 --> 42:28.128
Yes?

42:28.212 --> 42:29.755
Do you love my mom?

42:33.801 --> 42:35.219
Do you know what love is?

42:35.302 --> 42:37.930
Is there anyone
who doesn't know what love is?

42:40.766 --> 42:42.017
Do you love her?

42:46.814 --> 42:49.191
-I love her.
-How much?

42:49.525 --> 42:51.402
As much as the sky? The earth?

42:52.861 --> 42:54.113
Well,

42:54.488 --> 42:57.283
I can't say exactly how much

42:57.616 --> 42:58.993
I love her.

42:59.410 --> 43:00.661
Then

43:00.744 --> 43:03.038
you can't leave like my dad, okay?

43:09.086 --> 43:10.462
You have to stay

43:11.130 --> 43:13.090
with my mom for a long time, okay?

43:14.341 --> 43:15.718
You can't go

43:16.051 --> 43:18.512
to heaven all by yourself, okay?

43:47.541 --> 43:49.043
Okay. Get in.

44:01.513 --> 44:03.807
-Hello?
-Hello, Mr. Han.

44:03.891 --> 44:05.976
This is the social worker
from Seungjin Hospital.

44:06.518 --> 44:09.647
-Yes.
-Your application was approved.

44:09.730 --> 44:11.315
They gave their approval.

44:11.815 --> 44:14.985
Why don't you and your wife come tomorrow

44:15.069 --> 44:17.071
to set the date for surgery?

44:17.905 --> 44:18.947
We passed?

44:19.031 --> 44:20.115
Yes.

44:20.199 --> 44:22.159
I wish your mother a speedy recovery

44:22.660 --> 44:24.286
and happiness to your family.

44:26.789 --> 44:28.040
Thank you.

44:55.109 --> 44:57.069
You have a guest.

44:57.277 --> 44:58.278
Who?

45:04.201 --> 45:06.120
-Turn.
-Get lost.

45:10.791 --> 45:11.875
Mother.

45:14.795 --> 45:15.796
Mother.

45:16.964 --> 45:18.257
Are you done with work?

45:18.674 --> 45:19.758
Come in.

45:19.842 --> 45:21.343
I'm not going anywhere.

45:21.844 --> 45:22.845
Here.

45:25.180 --> 45:27.307
Don't go to see Seok-hwan again.

45:28.183 --> 45:29.560
Don't leave

45:30.144 --> 45:31.395
stupid pictures like this.

45:35.816 --> 45:37.359
I heard you have a new man.

45:38.986 --> 45:40.487
Why did you go to see Seok-hwan?

45:41.363 --> 45:42.739
Because you felt bad?

45:43.532 --> 45:46.493
You left this picture
to relieve your guilt?

45:48.829 --> 45:49.955
Was that why

45:50.706 --> 45:53.292
you came to see me?

45:53.959 --> 45:55.502
So that you'd feel better?

45:56.587 --> 46:00.841
Or did you want to leave your kid with me?

46:02.801 --> 46:05.262
I heard you had it hard,

46:05.971 --> 46:07.848
so I tried to be sympathetic

46:09.641 --> 46:11.059
for old time's sake,

46:12.144 --> 46:14.062
and for the years we were neighbors.

46:14.980 --> 46:17.566
"I should stop and be nice."

46:18.609 --> 46:20.194
That's what I told myself.

46:21.945 --> 46:24.698
But you didn't even visit me once then.

46:25.115 --> 46:27.075
And now you're visiting me
because you have a new man?

46:27.784 --> 46:30.120
Now that you're getting married,
did you feel bad?

46:30.913 --> 46:32.539
Did you feel bad about your husband

46:34.082 --> 46:35.876
who is buried under the cold, hard ground?

46:37.127 --> 46:38.378
Mother.

46:40.631 --> 46:41.757
What?

46:42.591 --> 46:43.634
Is it unfair?

46:44.801 --> 46:45.844
Are you hurt?

46:48.639 --> 46:51.934
Or do you think this evil mother-in-law

46:52.142 --> 46:55.103
is here to hold her daughter-in-law back
out of bitterness?

46:55.187 --> 46:56.563
No.

46:56.855 --> 46:58.357
-Yes, you do.
-No...

46:58.482 --> 46:59.733
I'm right.

46:59.858 --> 47:01.777
I am an evil mother-in-law.

47:01.860 --> 47:03.612
Hearing that you have a new man

47:04.071 --> 47:06.406
infuriated me! That's why I'm here!

47:07.824 --> 47:09.076
My son...

47:11.411 --> 47:12.663
My son...

47:13.038 --> 47:14.540
What about my son?

47:15.082 --> 47:16.875
My kind son.

47:19.753 --> 47:21.213
It's your fault he died.

47:26.843 --> 47:28.136
Mother.

47:42.776 --> 47:44.861
Eun-seong, let's get you to bed.

47:46.363 --> 47:47.614
Eun-seong.

47:51.034 --> 47:52.160
Is that him?

48:01.378 --> 48:02.921
I've lost my mind. Why did I come here?

48:03.005 --> 48:04.131
I've lost my mind.

48:04.381 --> 48:05.632
Go on.

48:05.716 --> 48:07.593
Mother.

48:08.927 --> 48:10.262
-Ho-jun.
-Yes?

48:10.345 --> 48:12.014
Take her for a minute.

48:17.144 --> 48:18.395
Wait.

48:19.980 --> 48:22.399
-Mother, please.
-Get off me!

48:23.650 --> 48:25.110
Mother, please.

48:30.824 --> 48:33.327
Are you her boyfriend?

48:33.410 --> 48:34.828
Mother, let's talk...

48:36.872 --> 48:38.248
Live a happy life.

48:39.082 --> 48:42.127
Live long and prosper.

48:43.170 --> 48:45.005
Don't abuse my grandchild.

48:47.924 --> 48:48.884
Mother.

48:48.967 --> 48:50.218
Let's go.

48:50.344 --> 48:51.595
Eun-seong is waiting.

49:05.400 --> 49:06.735
You're bleeding.

49:13.575 --> 49:14.868
I'm fine.

49:18.622 --> 49:21.333
Why do you get flustered in front of your
in-laws? Did you do something wrong?

49:24.044 --> 49:25.545
All your husband did
was leave you in debt.

49:25.796 --> 49:27.464
Why do you still cling onto him like that?

49:34.388 --> 49:36.014
Don't say that.

49:38.892 --> 49:40.602
He was a good person.

49:43.522 --> 49:45.524
He always gave everything to me.

49:49.069 --> 49:50.237
If he was so good,

49:50.320 --> 49:52.572
how could he die
and leave you and the kid alone?

49:55.117 --> 49:57.244
No one dies because they want to.

49:59.663 --> 50:01.289
You don't know my husband.

50:03.375 --> 50:05.210
Watch what you say.

50:08.004 --> 50:09.339
He was

50:10.674 --> 50:12.592
a much greater person than you.

50:39.286 --> 50:40.662
We have to go to the hospital tomorrow.

50:46.418 --> 50:47.919
We passed the interview.

50:52.674 --> 50:53.925
We'll be setting

50:54.301 --> 50:55.552
the date for surgery.

50:55.719 --> 50:56.970
Really?

51:01.725 --> 51:03.268
Did you think we'd fail?

51:04.311 --> 51:06.480
Come to the hospital by noon.

51:07.689 --> 51:09.983
Okay. I will.

51:13.737 --> 51:14.988
Are you happy?

51:16.656 --> 51:17.908
Pardon?

51:18.658 --> 51:19.993
You're selling your liver.

51:21.912 --> 51:23.205
Are you happy?

51:24.998 --> 51:26.458
It's a relief.

51:27.167 --> 51:28.960
I was so worried.

51:34.049 --> 51:35.300
Fine.

51:37.052 --> 51:38.303
Go on.

51:41.765 --> 51:43.016
Okay.

51:46.436 --> 51:48.230
Why do you live so foolishly?

52:04.913 --> 52:06.164
I will

52:07.791 --> 52:09.417
divorce you quickly,

52:11.795 --> 52:13.129
so meet...

52:15.423 --> 52:16.800
a good guy next time.

52:19.803 --> 52:21.012
Okay?

53:08.894 --> 53:10.562
HANNAM FOOD

53:10.937 --> 53:12.355
Where's Ji-hun?

53:12.439 --> 53:14.941
He's at the head office.

53:15.025 --> 53:17.068
What do you mean? I'm at the head office.

53:17.152 --> 53:18.153
Pardon?

53:18.862 --> 53:20.196
Let's go to Samseong-dong.

53:35.420 --> 53:36.338
Mr. Han.

53:37.047 --> 53:38.465
She's home, right?

53:38.548 --> 53:40.383
She isn't in right now.

53:40.467 --> 53:41.718
I know everything.

53:42.093 --> 53:43.386
Tell her I'm here.

53:44.095 --> 53:47.515
But she is in the hospital.

53:48.850 --> 53:49.976
The hospital?

53:55.190 --> 53:57.400
HAN SEONG-GUK

53:57.484 --> 53:58.944
Call me right away.

53:59.361 --> 54:01.237
He never looked for me before.

54:02.656 --> 54:05.450
Now he's suddenly rushing to find me.

54:31.434 --> 54:32.852
Get me some water...

54:43.196 --> 54:44.489
Hello.

54:45.240 --> 54:46.992
-What brings you here?
-Ma'am.

54:47.075 --> 54:48.994
They set the date for your surgery.

54:49.661 --> 54:50.870
They did?

54:50.954 --> 54:52.122
Yes.

54:52.205 --> 54:54.374
I thought I'd stop by since I was here.

54:55.166 --> 54:57.127
I heard you haven't been able to eat,

54:57.293 --> 54:58.795
so I made you some porridge.

54:59.087 --> 55:00.797
It's sea bream porridge.

55:01.506 --> 55:03.967
I know I made it, but it tastes good.

55:04.050 --> 55:07.929
Goodness, you must be a good cook.

55:08.430 --> 55:10.265
Please wait outside.

55:10.348 --> 55:12.934
-Yes, ma'am. I'll take that.
-Thank you.

55:16.187 --> 55:17.439
Where's Ji-hun?

55:17.897 --> 55:19.315
Did he come with you?

55:21.901 --> 55:25.905
SEUNGJIN HOSPITAL

55:36.916 --> 55:38.043
Dad.

55:45.175 --> 55:46.176
Which room is it?

55:46.259 --> 55:47.802
It's room 1016.

55:47.927 --> 55:49.179
This way.

55:58.313 --> 55:59.606
I'm sorry.

55:59.689 --> 56:00.815
Eighth floor.

56:10.867 --> 56:12.952
I heard you grew up by the sea,

56:13.036 --> 56:14.704
so I thought you'd like fish porridge.

56:15.205 --> 56:17.415
I also grew up by the sea.

56:17.624 --> 56:20.251
My grandma made this for me
all the time when I was sick.

56:20.335 --> 56:21.586
Who said that?

56:22.003 --> 56:23.421
Who told you where I'm from?

56:24.798 --> 56:27.300
I studied a lot so I could pass
the interview.

56:28.384 --> 56:30.512
Who told you to learn that?

56:31.638 --> 56:32.889
I don't eat things like that.

56:33.139 --> 56:34.390
It smells fishy.

56:36.643 --> 56:38.228
It isn't fishy at all.

56:38.520 --> 56:39.771
Try some.

56:42.524 --> 56:43.900
Hello.

56:43.983 --> 56:44.984
Hello.

56:45.068 --> 56:46.402
Oh, you're here.

56:46.486 --> 56:49.739
It's so nice to see this relationship
between in-laws.

56:51.324 --> 56:52.867
This must not have been an easy decision.

56:54.035 --> 56:56.246
You were blessed
with a great daughter-in-law.

57:09.092 --> 57:10.343
Did you

57:10.718 --> 57:12.804
just say "daughter-in-law"?

57:17.517 --> 57:18.476
Hello.

57:23.982 --> 57:25.108
Dad.

57:25.692 --> 57:26.943
Doctor.

57:27.610 --> 57:30.155
This is a family emergency.

57:30.238 --> 57:32.490
Can you check my blood pressure later?

57:32.574 --> 57:34.659
Yes, of course.

57:34.742 --> 57:35.952
Shall we go to another room first?

57:36.035 --> 57:36.995
Yes, of course.

57:42.125 --> 57:43.710
What are you doing here?

57:45.295 --> 57:46.379
"Daughter-in-law"?

57:46.463 --> 57:47.964
She's my caregiver.

57:48.923 --> 57:50.550
She's a good worker,

57:50.633 --> 57:53.052
so I kiddingly said she should
become my daughter-in-law,

57:53.136 --> 57:55.847
so the hospital staff calls her that.

57:56.055 --> 57:57.307
Give me my porridge.

57:57.557 --> 57:58.391
Yes.

57:59.309 --> 58:00.935
When did you come?

58:01.895 --> 58:03.938
You said your mom went to Spain.

58:04.147 --> 58:06.357
Why did she go on a trip to the hospital?

58:06.983 --> 58:09.652
I thought you'd be happy
if you knew I was sick,

58:10.153 --> 58:12.280
so I told Ji-hun to tell you that.

58:14.616 --> 58:17.160
What brought you all the way here?

58:18.369 --> 58:20.580
I'm sure it wasn't
because you were worried about me.

58:22.749 --> 58:25.710
Did you come to see Ji-hun?

58:25.960 --> 58:27.504
What's wrong with you?

58:27.754 --> 58:29.172
It's nothing.

58:29.964 --> 58:31.549
My liver is slightly damaged.

58:31.883 --> 58:33.134
It's from all the drinking.

58:33.718 --> 58:35.845
You must have been here a while

58:37.514 --> 58:38.765
for you to get close

58:39.057 --> 58:40.183
to your caregiver.

58:42.185 --> 58:45.688
I will go and get something to drink
for your guest.

58:45.772 --> 58:47.565
-Would you?
-Sure.

59:03.373 --> 59:06.042
You must really want to make her
your daughter-in-law.

59:06.584 --> 59:09.045
Why are you staring at my caregiver?

59:09.921 --> 59:14.259
Or, is it because you're still obsessed
with young women?

59:15.635 --> 59:18.096
You're sick because you talk like that.

59:18.179 --> 59:19.973
Did I say anything wrong?

59:20.348 --> 59:22.100
You should look at the patient,

59:22.183 --> 59:23.935
not her caregiver.

59:25.019 --> 59:26.729
You're using our son
and doing things in secret.

59:26.813 --> 59:29.023
What are you scheming?

59:29.399 --> 59:31.025
Act your age!

59:31.109 --> 59:33.027
Are you going to scheme
for the rest of your life?

59:33.111 --> 59:34.779
What? Scheme?

59:35.488 --> 59:37.907
What did I do...

59:38.825 --> 59:39.826
Mom.

59:39.909 --> 59:40.994
Ji-hun...

59:41.077 --> 59:42.245
Call the doctor.

59:43.454 --> 59:45.081
I can't breathe.

59:45.832 --> 59:47.166
Please leave.

59:47.250 --> 59:49.168
-Come back another time.
-Gosh.

59:49.252 --> 59:51.170
Come back? Don't ever come back.

59:52.463 --> 59:55.049
I never want to see your face again.

59:55.550 --> 59:57.594
You told me to never come back!

59:57.677 --> 1:00:01.889
You said all of that,
so why are you looking for me? Why?

1:00:01.973 --> 1:00:04.017
Why?

1:00:06.227 --> 1:00:07.478
Why?

1:00:11.232 --> 1:00:13.192
You ignored everything I said.

1:00:13.276 --> 1:00:14.861
And you were here being a good son?

1:00:15.737 --> 1:00:17.280
She has no other guardian.

1:00:17.697 --> 1:00:19.324
What a devoted son.

1:00:19.991 --> 1:00:22.118
She didn't raise you,
but she's still your mother?

1:00:24.746 --> 1:00:27.123
Why didn't you tell me
that she was in the hospital?

1:00:28.041 --> 1:00:29.751
I didn't think you'd care.

1:00:30.418 --> 1:00:31.544
What?

1:00:32.754 --> 1:00:34.005
Do you care?

1:00:34.172 --> 1:00:35.465
You don't care

1:00:35.965 --> 1:00:37.800
what's wrong with her or how bad it is.

1:00:38.134 --> 1:00:39.302
You didn't even ask.

1:00:39.385 --> 1:00:40.845
She's obviously faking it.

1:00:41.471 --> 1:00:43.514
She's putting on a show to get attention.

1:00:43.848 --> 1:00:45.099
Don't be fooled.

1:00:49.479 --> 1:00:50.647
You...

1:00:55.693 --> 1:00:57.028
She isn't her caregiver, is she?

1:00:59.322 --> 1:01:01.115
-That's--
-Who is that girl?

1:01:24.514 --> 1:01:26.849
-Who is this?
-It's Mister.

1:01:26.933 --> 1:01:29.394
Dad is very pleased with your girlfriend.

1:01:29.644 --> 1:01:31.646
Ji-hun may act cold,

1:01:31.729 --> 1:01:34.232
but he's warm and kind on the inside.

1:01:37.694 --> 1:01:38.861
What did I do?

1:01:38.945 --> 1:01:41.030
Who likes who? Who thinks that way?

1:01:42.240 --> 1:01:43.616
He's my dad.

1:01:45.243 --> 1:01:48.121
People would think you're
a real married couple.

1:01:49.914 --> 1:01:52.208
