20:52.380 --> 20:53.730
-Yes, you can, Maurice.

20:53.730 --> 20:56.300

21:04.180 --> 21:07.140
-He had so much to live for.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.190
Look at him.

21:09.190 --> 21:13.240
So much more booty
shaking to do.

21:13.240 --> 21:16.670
So much more getting things
done and doing things.

21:19.480 --> 21:22.230
-We're too late.

21:24.530 --> 21:26.960
-He's still breathing!

21:26.960 --> 21:29.370
Quite loudly.

[CHOKING]

21:30.650 --> 21:31.570
-OK.

21:31.570 --> 21:32.600
I've had it.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.110
Everybody been bugging
me all day long

21:34.110 --> 21:36.010
and keeping me up all night.

21:36.010 --> 21:37.080
I'm fed up!

21:37.080 --> 21:38.150
What's going on?

21:38.150 --> 21:40.830
-Well, mammal, this
document addressed to you

21:40.830 --> 21:44.120
informed us that you were
dying from ofasaliva.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.190
-Your one hope was
the dendrobium orchid.

21:46.190 --> 21:46.890
-What?

21:46.890 --> 21:48.450
-No need to thank us.

21:48.450 --> 21:49.980
All in a night's work.

21:49.980 --> 21:52.430
-Maurice!

21:52.430 --> 21:56.490
Another junk fax came for
you. "Maurice, you have only

21:56.490 --> 22:00.000
24 hours to live the
life of your dreams

22:00.000 --> 22:02.640
on the island Ofu Olosega."

22:02.640 --> 22:03.340
-Hey!

22:03.340 --> 22:06.470
That's the home of
the dendrobium orchid.

22:07.570 --> 22:08.270
-Oh.

22:10.850 --> 22:11.760
-Oh.

22:11.760 --> 22:14.290
Thank goodness you're being OK.

22:14.290 --> 22:20.240
Oh, I was so worried I was
catering to your every need.

22:20.240 --> 22:25.600
I fed you all my
yummies, even my walnuts.

22:25.600 --> 22:28.850
And you-- you are the
one who got me these.

22:28.850 --> 22:30.660

had 24 hours to live?

-Yes.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.740
And now I am giving you
only 24 hours to live

22:36.740 --> 22:39.610
after what you put me through.

22:39.610 --> 22:42.230
-So it was all a
misunderstanding.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.450
-The best kind of
misunderstanding,

22:44.450 --> 22:47.490
fueled by tragedy but
loaded with hijinks.

22:47.490 --> 22:48.460
-Ah well.

On the bright side,
