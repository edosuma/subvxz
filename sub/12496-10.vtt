09:23.208 --> 09:26.625
- Hey, I wanted this job.

09:23.208 --> 09:26.625
And you need a sidekick.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.959
- I know but...

09:26.667 --> 09:29.959
maybe it's too risky.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.375
- You take the risks.

09:31.417 --> 09:33.709
- I'm indestructible.

09:33.750 --> 09:38.583
- I wish we could make

09:33.750 --> 09:38.583
Henry indestructible.

09:38.625 --> 09:41.583
- Yeah. Too bad the machine

09:38.625 --> 09:41.583
that made me indestructible

09:41.625 --> 09:44.083
was destroyed.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.792
- What are you talking about?

09:45.834 --> 09:48.875
The densitizer

09:45.834 --> 09:48.875
was never destroyed.

09:48.917 --> 09:52.458
- Yes it was, remember?

09:52.500 --> 09:55.458
The accident...

09:52.500 --> 09:55.458
that destroyed the machine?

09:57.417 --> 10:00.959
- Why are you talking

09:57.417 --> 10:00.959
to me like this?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.667
The machine is downstairs!

10:03.709 --> 10:06.667
- Geez, what do you not

10:03.709 --> 10:06.667
understand about this look?

10:06.709 --> 10:08.834
- It means lie!

10:06.709 --> 10:08.834
I wanted you to lie!

10:08.875 --> 10:11.291
Why won't you lie?

10:11.333 --> 10:13.083
- You lied to us?

10:13.125 --> 10:17.208
- Noooooo. Right, Schwoz?

10:17.250 --> 10:20.083
I could show you

10:17.250 --> 10:20.083
the machine right now.

10:20.125 --> 10:23.250
- Ray, the densitizer's

10:20.125 --> 10:23.250
been here the whole time

10:23.291 --> 10:25.208
I've known you?

10:25.250 --> 10:27.125
- Yes, it has.

10:27.166 --> 10:29.500
- Then why can't Henry

10:27.166 --> 10:29.500
be densitized?

10:29.542 --> 10:32.250
- Yeah, why can't I

10:29.542 --> 10:32.250
be indestructible like you?

10:34.792 --> 10:36.583
- You want to know why?

10:34.792 --> 10:36.583
- Yeah.

10:36.625 --> 10:38.208
- You really wanna know why?

10:36.625 --> 10:38.208
- I do.

10:38.250 --> 10:39.750
- 'Cuz I'll show ya.

10:39.792 --> 10:42.000
I'll take you

10:39.792 --> 10:42.000
to the densitizer right now.

10:42.041 --> 10:43.667
I'll show you the machine

10:42.041 --> 10:43.667
that changed everything

10:43.709 --> 10:46.333
if that's what you really want.

10:46.375 --> 10:48.166
- That'd be great.

10:48.208 --> 10:50.625
- Okay, let's go.

10:48.208 --> 10:50.625
- 'Kay.

11:04.458 --> 11:09.291
- This is the Room of Storage.

11:09.333 --> 11:12.291
- So, where's the machine

11:09.333 --> 11:12.291
that made you indestructible?

11:12.333 --> 11:15.208
- Right over there.

11:12.333 --> 11:15.208
Schwoz, pull off the tarp.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.542
- Aye.

11:27.417 --> 11:31.542
- This is the trans-molecular

11:27.417 --> 11:31.542
densitizer.

11:31.583 --> 11:34.375
- Ughhh... Can someone

11:31.583 --> 11:34.375
please help me?

11:34.417 --> 11:37.333
- So, this is really the thing

11:34.417 --> 11:37.333
that made you indestructible?

11:37.375 --> 11:41.333
- Yeah. Waaaay back when.

11:41.375 --> 11:44.458
I remember it like

11:41.375 --> 11:44.458
a well-edited video...

11:44.500 --> 11:48.667
- Daddy! Daddy! Whoa! Whoa!

11:48.709 --> 11:50.834
- Raymond!

11:54.625 --> 11:57.041
- Son! Are you alright?

11:57.083 --> 11:59.625
- Yeah! I feel great!

12:02.125 --> 12:04.291
- God, I was a handsome kid.

12:04.333 --> 12:05.709
- Okay, come on!

12:05.750 --> 12:07.583
Let's fire this thing up

12:05.750 --> 12:07.583
and make me indestructible!

12:07.625 --> 12:09.375
- No!

12:09.417 --> 12:12.250
- Hey, I can't get out

12:09.417 --> 12:12.250
of this tarp!

12:12.291 --> 12:13.834
- Why can't we make Henry

12:12.291 --> 12:13.834
indestructible?

12:13.875 --> 12:15.667
- Because it won't work.

12:15.709 --> 12:18.625
- Why not? If it worked on you,

12:15.709 --> 12:18.625
it should work on me.

12:18.667 --> 12:22.291
- That's what my dad thought.

12:18.667 --> 12:22.291
But it didn't.

12:22.333 --> 12:25.041
After that made me

12:22.333 --> 12:25.041
indestructible, my dad

12:25.083 --> 12:27.875
and his team of scientists

12:25.083 --> 12:27.875
tried it on other people.

12:27.917 --> 12:29.333
- And what happened?

12:29.375 --> 12:32.083
- You want to know

12:29.375 --> 12:32.083
what happened?

12:32.125 --> 12:33.750
- Yeah.

12:33.792 --> 12:36.667
- Do you really want to know?

12:33.792 --> 12:36.667
- I do.

12:36.709 --> 12:38.458
- 'Cuz I'll show ya.

12:36.709 --> 12:38.458
I'll take you over there

12:38.500 --> 12:41.542
and I'll show you what--

12:38.500 --> 12:41.542
- Just show us! Just show us!

12:41.583 --> 12:43.333
- Okay, let's go.

12:45.417 --> 12:50.000
- Oww... D'ahhh...

12:45.417 --> 12:50.000
I'm having trouble breathing!

12:54.583 --> 12:56.125
- What is that?

12:56.166 --> 12:59.875
- This is a VHS tape.

12:59.917 --> 13:03.709
It's how humans

12:59.917 --> 13:03.709
used to store videos.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.166
You need to watch this.

13:05.208 --> 13:07.250
- Okay.

13:10.583 --> 13:12.458
Uh, where do I tap?

13:12.500 --> 13:14.834
- I don't even see a screen.

13:14.875 --> 13:17.750
- Ohhhhh, I know-I know...

13:21.500 --> 13:24.041
- Give me that!

13:24.083 --> 13:27.750
Now, after I was made

13:24.083 --> 13:27.750
indestructible as a kid,

13:27.792 --> 13:30.917
my father tried the same

13:27.792 --> 13:30.917
process on three other men.

13:30.959 --> 13:32.959
- So, what happened

13:30.959 --> 13:32.959
to those guys?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.333
- Did they become

13:33.000 --> 13:35.333
indestructible?

13:35.375 --> 13:37.583
- Oh no.

13:37.625 --> 13:40.125
But the machine did change them.

13:40.166 --> 13:41.583
- How?

13:41.625 --> 13:44.291
- You want to know?

13:41.625 --> 13:44.291
- Yeah.

13:44.333 --> 13:46.000
- You really want to know?

13:44.333 --> 13:46.000
'Cuz I'll show you--

13:46.041 --> 13:48.500
- Oh my god!

13:46.041 --> 13:48.500
- Stop that!

13:48.542 --> 13:51.625
- Here's what happened

13:48.542 --> 13:51.625
to Dave Macallan.

13:51.667 --> 13:54.041
[ garbled screams ]

13:54.083 --> 13:57.041
- Who's making that noise?

13:54.083 --> 13:57.041
- Watch.

13:59.250 --> 14:02.041
- Ah geez!

13:59.250 --> 14:02.041
- Turn that off!

14:02.083 --> 14:05.125
- Here's what happened

14:02.083 --> 14:05.125
to John Walker.

14:05.166 --> 14:11.083
- Ah! Ah! Ah!

14:05.166 --> 14:11.083
Why are they feet?

14:11.125 --> 14:12.959
- That's just wrong.

14:11.125 --> 14:12.959
That's just wrong.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.834
- And here's what the machine

14:13.000 --> 14:15.834
did to Glen Livet.

14:18.041 --> 14:19.792
- He looks okay.

14:19.834 --> 14:22.458
- Sure. Until a little arm

14:19.834 --> 14:22.458
comes out of his ear

14:22.500 --> 14:24.208
and pokes him in the eye.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.458
- Oh come on!

14:25.500 --> 14:26.542
- That can't happen.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.417
- Owwwww!!!

14:30.458 --> 14:33.458
D'ohhhh!

14:30.458 --> 14:33.458
Make it stop!

14:33.500 --> 14:36.083
Ow! Ow! Please god,

14:33.500 --> 14:36.083
make it... ow...stop!

14:38.500 --> 14:40.917
- All right. All right.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.917
- Press stop!

14:40.959 --> 14:43.000
- Ah.. Uh...

14:43.041 --> 14:45.375
- Now you see why the densitizer

14:43.041 --> 14:45.375
can never be used again?

14:45.417 --> 14:48.041
- But if it worked on you,

14:45.417 --> 14:48.041
why'd it do such awful things

14:48.083 --> 14:50.000
to those other guys?

14:50.041 --> 14:52.000
- No one knows.

14:52.041 --> 14:54.875
Well, I've got tickets to go see

14:52.041 --> 14:54.875
Loggins and Messina.

14:54.917 --> 14:56.917
Lock the door when you leave.

14:58.875 --> 15:00.542
- Well... too bad.

15:00.583 --> 15:02.208
- Yeah.

15:02.250 --> 15:05.458
Do you know how cool it'd be

15:02.250 --> 15:05.458
if I was indestructible?

15:05.500 --> 15:10.083
- Y'know what? I say you can

15:05.500 --> 15:10.083
be made indestructible.

15:10.125 --> 15:11.709
- How?

15:11.750 --> 15:13.959
- I have a theory.

15:11.750 --> 15:13.959
Come, I tell you out there.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.625
- Cool. Hey Charlotte, let's go!

15:16.667 --> 15:18.208
- No!

15:18.250 --> 15:20.291
- Charlotte--

15:18.250 --> 15:20.291
- I do not wanna see you grow

15:20.333 --> 15:22.000
a face in your belly button!

15:22.041 --> 15:23.709
- Just listen to what

15:22.041 --> 15:23.709
I have to s--

15:23.750 --> 15:26.542
- I can't hear you!

15:23.750 --> 15:26.542
Bloobidy-bloobidy-bloobidy...

15:26.583 --> 15:31.583
bloobidy-bloobidy-bloobidy...

15:36.083 --> 15:38.500
- You see, when Ray went

15:36.083 --> 15:38.500
into the densitizer,

15:38.542 --> 15:42.083
he was a young boy,

15:38.542 --> 15:42.083
just like Henry is a young boy.

15:42.125 --> 15:45.333
- Right, right, and the other

15:42.125 --> 15:45.333
three guys they tried it on,

15:45.375 --> 15:48.250
when it failed, were grownups.

15:48.291 --> 15:51.750
- They were grownups.

15:48.291 --> 15:51.750
Now they're mutant freaks.

15:51.792 --> 15:53.458
- Charlotte come on...

15:51.792 --> 15:53.458
- I'm not gonna sit

15:53.500 --> 15:55.834
beside you in science class if

15:53.500 --> 15:55.834
you have arms comin' out

15:55.875 --> 15:58.333
of your ears tryin' to poke you.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.667
- Listen. I've seen

15:58.375 --> 16:00.667
the security tapes.

16:00.709 --> 16:04.333
Not only was Ray a young boy

16:00.709 --> 16:04.333
when he was densitized...

16:04.375 --> 16:07.041
he was also on a skat-board.

16:07.083 --> 16:08.917
- A skat-board?

16:08.959 --> 16:13.500
- Yeah, you know, a board with

16:08.959 --> 16:13.500
the twirly wheels on the bottom.

16:13.542 --> 16:15.750
- He means skate board.

16:15.792 --> 16:19.208
- Yah, skaeet board.

16:19.250 --> 16:21.041
- Right. He was moving.

16:21.083 --> 16:24.834
- Yeah! So, I think if we

16:21.083 --> 16:24.834
re-create that same motion,

16:24.875 --> 16:28.709
with a boy who's not yet

16:24.875 --> 16:28.709
a grownup, like Henry,

16:28.750 --> 16:31.083
the machine will work on him

16:28.750 --> 16:31.083
the same way it worked on Ray

16:31.125 --> 16:34.417
when he was a boy.

16:31.125 --> 16:34.417
What you think?

16:34.458 --> 16:36.375
- I say we go for it.

16:36.417 --> 16:38.875
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

16:36.417 --> 16:38.875
I go prep the machine!

16:38.917 --> 16:40.333
- Alright. Char, let's go!

16:40.375 --> 16:42.083
- No.

16:42.125 --> 16:45.542
- Come on! If this works,

16:42.125 --> 16:45.542
I'll be the best sidekick

16:45.583 --> 16:47.375
any superhero ever had!

16:47.417 --> 16:49.583
- And if it doesn't work,

16:47.417 --> 16:49.583
you might end up with eyeballs

16:49.625 --> 16:51.583
on your butt.

16:51.625 --> 16:53.333
Have fun in the bathroom!

16:53.375 --> 16:55.500
- Pfft, nah. Schwoz is a genius.

16:55.542 --> 16:57.458
He thinks it'll work.

16:57.500 --> 17:01.959
- Then you go play with Schwoz

16:57.500 --> 17:01.959
I'm not movin' from this chair.

17:06.750 --> 17:10.208
- Man, I gotta start sittin'

17:06.750 --> 17:10.208
on things that don't roll.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.625
- Okay, dinner's ready!

17:25.667 --> 17:28.458
- Oh yay.

17:28.500 --> 17:31.667
- But Henry's not here, we can't

17:28.500 --> 17:31.667
eat dinner without Henry.

17:31.709 --> 17:33.542
Henry's not here.

17:33.583 --> 17:34.875
- I wonder where he is.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.208
- Maybe he got hit by a bus!

17:36.250 --> 17:38.083
Let's all go check

17:36.250 --> 17:38.083
the hospitals!

17:38.125 --> 17:43.834
- No! We're gonna eat

17:38.125 --> 17:43.834
my dinner now.

17:43.875 --> 17:47.125
- Hey, sorry to bother you guys,

17:43.875 --> 17:47.125
but do you have any dog treats?

17:47.166 --> 17:48.625
- Why would we have dog treats?

17:48.667 --> 17:50.417
- And what are you doing

17:48.667 --> 17:50.417
with those dogs anyway?

17:50.458 --> 17:52.417
- Oh, my neighbor's

17:50.458 --> 17:52.417
paying me ten bucks

17:52.458 --> 17:54.750
to walk them every day.

17:52.458 --> 17:54.750
But they seem hungry

17:54.792 --> 17:57.542
so I was wondering if you--whoa!

17:57.583 --> 17:59.208
- Ahhhhhh!!!

17:59.250 --> 18:00.625
- Noooo!

18:00.667 --> 18:02.375
- Wait! No, no, no! Retreat!
