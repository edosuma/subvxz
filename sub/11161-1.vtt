00:38.747 --> 00:40.908
(James) There are human footprints on the moon.

00:40.999 --> 00:44.287
and Rover is exploring
the surface of Mars.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.084
We can Google
a satellite picture

00:46.171 --> 00:48.662
of any place
on the Earth’s surface.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.713
So we often think
that our planet

00:50.801 --> 00:52.962
has been
completely explored.

00:53.053 --> 00:56.341
But the depths of the oceans
remain a mystery

00:56.431 --> 01:00.424
and the extreme depths
have barely been glimpsed.

01:00.519 --> 01:05.058
Down there is the last
great frontier of our world.

01:05.147 --> 01:08.390
There are 12 trenches
that are over 4 miles deep.

01:08.485 --> 01:11.477
They’re thousands of miles long and have a combined area

01:11.572 --> 01:14.405
greater than North America.

01:14.491 --> 01:18.609
7'hat’s a dark continent down there, waiting to be explored.

01:18.704 --> 01:23.869
Unseen by human eyes because the machines don’t exist to take us there.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.950
It’s my dream
to build such a machine,

01:26.044 --> 01:27.830
and get inside it

01:27.921 --> 01:30.628
and dive to the deepest
places in the world,

01:30.716 --> 01:33.799
to explore them
with my own eyes.

01:53.322 --> 01:55.938
I started preparing for these dives when l was a kid,

01:56.033 --> 01:58.115
getting in a cardboard box.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.567
Close the Iid, and imagine
it was a submarine.

02:00.662 --> 02:03.745
Boosh.

02:06.710 --> 02:10.578
Drawing with a crayon,
you know, some gauges.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.208
Fue|and_.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.039
depth.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.841
Yeah, I was a real
science geek, you know,

02:16.928 --> 02:20.591
but for me it was all about trying to understand the world,

02:20.682 --> 02:24.140
understand the limits
of possibility.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.560
Hey, little buddy.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.987
I think it was from
being a kid in the '60s

02:42.079 --> 02:44.786
when we were doing
so much exploration.

02:44.873 --> 02:48.707
From going to the moon and Jacques Cousteau was exploring the oceans

02:48.794 --> 02:51.957
and, you know,
I just loved that stuff.

02:52.047 --> 02:57.167
I couldn’t think of anything cooler than to be a deep ocean explorer.

02:57.260 --> 03:01.754
I can remember the first time that the deep ocean captured my imagination.

03:01.848 --> 03:06.763
It was, you know, when Trieste went to the bottom of the Challenger Deep.

03:06.853 --> 03:10.345
(TV) The Bathyscaphe would pass its ultimate test in 1960,

03:10.440 --> 03:14.058
its third model carrying Piccard’s son, Jacques, and Don Walsh

03:14.152 --> 03:17.360
35, 000 feet down
into the Mariana Trench.

03:20.200 --> 03:24.034
(James)The Bathyscaphe Trieste was an amazing machine for its time.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.954
A massive
150-ton steel balloon

03:27.040 --> 03:32.285
filled with gasoline
for flotation.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.290
It had a 14-ton
pressure sphere

03:34.381 --> 03:36.337
for the crew
slung underneath.

03:38.885 --> 03:42.173
(Don)
Oxygen, one thin bar.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.300
Scrubber fans on.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.382
[tapping]
Damn it.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.512
Tachometer’s taken a hit.

03:48.603 --> 03:51.720
We go without it.

03:51.815 --> 03:55.182
(James)Inside the sphere,U. 8. Navy Lieutenant
Don Walsh

03:55.277 --> 03:57.359
and scientist Jacques Piccard

03:57.446 --> 04:00.563
would pilot Trieste to the bottom of Challenger Deep.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.776
It was a dive into history.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.829
But no one
has been back since.

04:24.097 --> 04:28.716
Just like on Trieste, the heart of our new sub is a steel sphere,

04:28.810 --> 04:30.766
forged in fire.

04:33.899 --> 04:38.188
52 years later, there’s still no better solution.

04:38.278 --> 04:43.693
The sphere is nature’s perfect shape for resisting pressure.

04:43.784 --> 04:47.197
And it’s going to protect me from the crushing force down at the bottom.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.120
Over 16,000 pounds
per square inch.

04:53.210 --> 04:57.829
That’s like having two Humvees
stacked on your thumbnail.

04:57.923 --> 05:01.086
it’s taken us three years to design and build this sphere.

05:01.176 --> 05:07.217
We have to heat treat
the steel...

05:07.307 --> 05:09.423
to be strong enough
to withstand the weight

05:09.518 --> 05:11.804
of seven vertical miles
of water.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.026
We have to know that
the sphere is safe.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.728
If it buckles on a real dive,

05:23.824 --> 05:26.110
it’II implode
at hypersonic speed

05:26.201 --> 05:30.240
and I get chummed into a meat cloud in about two microseconds.

05:35.585 --> 05:39.294
The clinks I heard when we tested it the first time,

05:39.381 --> 05:42.339
when we got rid of the stress cracking, that hasn’t happened.

05:42.425 --> 05:46.009
It’s 16,000 psi.
Looks like we’ve done it.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.712
Yeah, you got to be happy with that. We're all the way to the top.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.889
So, it’s as you predicted?
It's as we predicted.

05:50.976 --> 05:54.844
Well done.
Good on you, Ron.

05:54.938 --> 05:59.773
When you design technology
to do something new,

05:59.860 --> 06:02.852
it’s going to look strange.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.771
The Deepsea Challenger
is a vertical torpedo.

06:05.866 --> 06:10.155
it’s designed to scream down through the water column at high speed.

06:10.245 --> 06:13.362
The reason for that is we’d just rather spend the time at the bottom

06:13.456 --> 06:17.495
working, exploring, than going through seven miles of water.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.872
There are certain fish
that actually will hover

06:19.963 --> 06:22.830
over the reef
in a vertical position.

06:22.924 --> 06:25.415
So, nature provided an example

06:25.510 --> 06:28.343
of the fact that it’s not crazy to think that a submersible

06:28.430 --> 06:31.388
can move through the water
in an upright position.

06:35.437 --> 06:37.223
Deepsea Challenger
is not a stunt vehicle

06:37.314 --> 06:41.057
to just go down
and set a depth record.

06:41.151 --> 06:45.815
it’s designed from the ground up as a science platform.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.864
There’s a hydraulic manipulator arm for taking samples.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.111
A sample tray
in the science door.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.818
There are push cores
for taking sediment.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.280
A payload bay
for instruments.

06:56.374 --> 07:01.038
And two 3D cameras, one on the boom and one on the arm.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.462
Every single thing on this vehicle has to be built from scratch

07:04.549 --> 07:06.835
to withstand
the crushing pressure.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.965
it’s just this kind of
ragtag group

07:12.057 --> 07:13.843
working in this
little tiny shop

07:13.934 --> 07:15.799
next to a plumbing supply
place on that side

07:15.894 --> 07:18.886
and a plywood supply
place on that side.

07:18.980 --> 07:23.019
You know, nobody even knows
what we’re doing in here.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.475
And one of the most amazing things about this vehicle

07:25.570 --> 07:31.440
is that it shrinks over two inches during the dive from pressure.

07:31.534 --> 07:35.618
That’s enough to shear
aircraft grade bolts.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.412
Yeah, it’s still got
to go in quite a way.

07:38.500 --> 07:42.584
(James) So the sphere is actually held onto the sub by straps.

07:42.671 --> 07:45.003
But we’re also fighting
the pressure of time.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.706
Our expedition ship
just arrived

07:47.801 --> 07:52.261
and we’re supposed to leave in less than three weeks, but we don’t have a sub.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.463
it’s still in pieces
all over the shop.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.639
How big a problem is that?

07:56.726 --> 07:59.513
I need to know when we’re going to see some action on that sub,

07:59.604 --> 08:01.344
so we can start doing
some integration.

08:01.439 --> 08:02.804
If you're saying
3rd of January

08:02.899 --> 08:04.730
we’re going
to have it wired out,

08:04.818 --> 08:07.104
we’re still weeks away
from getting integration done.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.277
(James) We have to have an integration schedule.

08:09.364 --> 08:13.107
I want that schedule put up on the wall right over there, okay?

08:13.201 --> 08:16.284
Who’s got to have their stuff plugged in, ready to test, when.

08:16.371 --> 08:20.205
And everybody is going to be individually accountable for their stuff to that schedule.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.998
We’ve got a ship sitting at that pier down there with nothing to do.

08:23.086 --> 08:28.046
Right now it’s just on the clock like a taxi meter.

08:28.133 --> 08:31.296
A taxi meter at $35,000 a day.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.967
Jim’s management style is often to put people under pressure

08:34.054 --> 08:36.261
and get results from that
and...

08:36.349 --> 08:39.716
that can work really well, but when you're in a R&D project,

08:39.811 --> 08:43.804
sometimes things just
aren’t going to work.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.059
(Dave) And we’ve got some mechanical problems here

08:46.151 --> 08:48.642
that we’ll solve
over the next couple of weeks.

08:48.737 --> 08:51.149
Hopefully before Christmas Eve, if we can do it.

08:51.239 --> 08:54.151
If not, it will be Boxing Day.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.903
(James)
We’re not going to compromise.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.655
You don’t compromise.

08:57.746 --> 09:01.079
Not on the stuff
that keeps you alive.

09:01.166 --> 09:04.329
The most important thing
is the weight system.

09:04.419 --> 09:07.911
Basically you strap a bunch of weight on the sub at the surface

09:08.006 --> 09:10.998
and then you let go and the thing sinks like a rock.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.799
So, literally,
if the weights don’t come off,

09:13.887 --> 09:16.799
the sub doesn’t come up.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.472
(James) So when you’ve got a system that’s survival critical,

09:19.559 --> 09:26.556
the only way to be confident is to test it over and over and over and over.

09:26.649 --> 09:29.311
When you dive to the bottom of the ocean you have to face the fact

09:29.402 --> 09:32.894
that there are a hundred
horrible ways to die.

09:32.947 --> 09:36.235
In the unlikely event that there is a break in any of the seals,

09:36.326 --> 09:39.284
in even the penetrator or the hatch... Closing hatch.

09:39.370 --> 09:43.033
the water will bust through with the strength of which it could cut a man in half.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.660
There’s the risk of fire.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.743
It’s Jim’s personal nightmare.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.828
Go! Drill.
Fire, fire, fire!

09:49.923 --> 09:51.663
Forward cabin.

09:59.516 --> 10:02.383
Okay, I'm on mask comms.

10:02.477 --> 10:05.139
Vision life support.
Shut down the oxygen.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.970
Copy that.

10:07.065 --> 10:09.681
Now, vision one.
Now, what about vision two?

10:09.776 --> 10:11.562
Bail out rebreather.
Isolate the oxygen.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.109
Shut it off.
Right.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.902
Consider drop weights.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.981
Right, drop weights.
Weights coming off.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.361
Weights are off.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.819
And done.
That’s 25 seconds.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.075
Yeah, 25 seconds.

10:25.166 --> 10:28.533
Okay, I give myself a 50I50 chance of survival on that.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.994
(John) The biggest danger is probably C02,

10:31.089 --> 10:32.795
the waste product
from our breath.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.543
And if that’s
not cleaned and scrubbed,

10:34.634 --> 10:36.215
the pilot will be
struggling to breathe

10:36.302 --> 10:38.088
and will eventually
pass out and die.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.635
[alarm beeping]

10:41.683 --> 10:44.140
Jim. you okay?

10:44.227 --> 10:47.594
(James)I think that there’s a certain kind of healthy paranoia

10:47.689 --> 10:51.102
that goes into the engineering
of a vehicle like this.

10:51.192 --> 10:56.778
You funnel that anxiety into the engineering solutions that make it safe.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.948
Done.
Good.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.946
What I don’t like
personally focusing on

11:03.037 --> 11:06.746
is what if somebody had
to call Suzy and tell her?

11:06.833 --> 11:09.916
I hear all the risks
because he tells me.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.085
And then he tells me
all of the things

11:12.172 --> 11:15.710
that he’s created
so that it will be safe.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.041
And dome. All right?
Got it. Sure.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.343
And Iet’s say the dome cue three times.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.842
Action!

11:22.932 --> 11:25.093
Dome, dome, dome.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.973
(Suzy) I've watched him do it now for 16 years.

11:30.064 --> 11:32.146
Whether it’s with our children
or on a film set

11:32.233 --> 11:35.396
or an expedition,
he sets his bar so high

11:35.486 --> 11:42.904
with safety, with creativity, with everything he does. Cut.

11:42.994 --> 11:47.704
Wow. The whole upper section has all been on and come back off.

11:47.790 --> 11:52.124
Remember I told you everything goes on and comes back off?
Yeah. Yeah.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.704
(James) You got to think a lot about what your priorities are.

11:55.798 --> 12:00.337
You know, I mean, I'm a family man, got five kids.

12:00.428 --> 12:03.044
A lot of people would
set their priorities as...

12:03.139 --> 12:06.427
those are the ultimate priority, and they are to me.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.348
You ready to come out?

12:08.436 --> 12:10.518
But I think a part
of what you give your kids

12:10.605 --> 12:14.348
is more than just your presence. it’s your example.

12:14.442 --> 12:18.310
All right. Now we got our youngest deep ocean explorer.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.896
She’s already taken
her pink Uggs off.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.357
You want to go for a dive?
You want to go underwater?

12:24.452 --> 12:27.194
If you live in fear and you never follow your dreams,

12:27.288 --> 12:29.870
you’ve compromised
in a much greater way.

12:31.960 --> 12:35.953
l was in love with the ocean
before we ever met.

12:36.047 --> 12:40.381
It was watching all those great underwater explorers on TV in the '60s

12:40.468 --> 12:43.505
that got me excited
about this alien world

12:43.596 --> 12:48.761
that was right here on Earth
that was as rich and exotic

12:48.851 --> 12:53.060
as anything that
I could imagine myself.

12:53.147 --> 12:59.939
For me, diving,
that’s my calm place.

13:00.029 --> 13:03.317
I feel privileged
to get to bear witness

13:03.408 --> 13:07.447
to the imaginative power
of evolution that’s created

13:07.537 --> 13:11.075
all these unbelievable
forms of life.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.406
Man, I just am--
I'm inspired by that.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.368
Test, test, test.
One, two, three, four.

13:16.462 --> 13:20.171
First recorded dialogue
underwater, on film,

13:20.258 --> 13:23.591
for a theatrical motion picture
in the history of the world.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.794
Okay.
And, action!

13:25.888 --> 13:29.972
When I chose a career as an adult, it was filmmaking,

13:30.018 --> 13:32.600
and of course the stories
that I chose to tell

13:32.687 --> 13:34.427
were science fiction stories.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.683
I need you to be
closer to the camera.

13:36.774 --> 13:39.891
I need to have the shot cut right about here. It’s a close up, okay?

13:44.824 --> 13:47.566
So I make a movie
called The Abyss.

13:47.660 --> 13:52.495
At the core of it is this idea of going deeper and seeing what’s down there.

13:55.918 --> 14:00.787
And in it are all these, at the time, cutting edge new pieces of technology

14:00.882 --> 14:05.751
like R0 Vs, like a robot that can fly underwater. What a great concept.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.757
And so at that point, I think for the first time I stepped over a line

14:08.848 --> 14:13.433
from science fiction
into a reality that involved

14:13.519 --> 14:15.726
these kind
of science fictional concepts

14:15.813 --> 14:18.350
of robotics and deep exploration and so on,

14:18.399 --> 14:20.264
and that’s when I decided
to do Titanic.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.271
Because I knew that
in the making of that film,

14:22.362 --> 14:25.479
I would get to dive
to the Titanic for real.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.650
That was the first time
I ever went really deep,

14:30.745 --> 14:34.033
the kind of deep that
I used to imagine as a kid.

14:34.123 --> 14:37.707
Pitch black.
Going to another world.

14:43.591 --> 14:47.049
l was struck by how surreal
it was to actually be there

14:47.136 --> 14:49.001
at the wreck
of this famous ship

14:49.097 --> 14:51.383
that had seemed like
a legend to me all my life.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.806
And it wasn’t
a legend anymore.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.351
It was a real place
where real people died,

14:57.438 --> 15:00.976
where this great tragedy
had taken place.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.817
And something about looking out at that rusty deck,

15:12.912 --> 15:15.745
knowing that that’s right where First Officer Murdock

15:15.790 --> 15:20.329
loaded the lifeboats, or where the ship’s band played

15:20.420 --> 15:22.911
just had
this huge effect on me.

15:30.304 --> 15:33.216
I really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration.

15:33.307 --> 15:37.971
It was adventure, it was curiosity, and it was an experience

15:38.062 --> 15:41.896
that Hollywood couldn't give me. Whoa.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.909
[crowd cheering]

15:57.582 --> 16:01.291
So, after Titanic I said

16:01.377 --> 16:04.915
you know, I'm just going
to park my day job

16:05.006 --> 16:07.713
as a Hollywood movie maker

16:07.800 --> 16:11.418
and I'm going to go be
a full time explorer.

16:11.512 --> 16:15.096
(James on radio) Okay, Jake’s out. Trim is good.

16:15.183 --> 16:17.799
Yeah, this is so much
like flying a helicopter.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.101
Feels like
a pretty stable hover.

16:20.188 --> 16:22.520
(James narrating) If I was going to go back to Titanic,

16:22.607 --> 16:26.191
I wanted to explore the wreck like never before, on the inside.

16:26.277 --> 16:28.814
So we built this little bot.
Pretty cool.

16:28.905 --> 16:34.150
that was designed to be just a little bit smaller than a B deck window.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.110
(James) Okay, I'm going in. [man] Oh, don’t do it. Don’t do it.

16:37.205 --> 16:39.742
If you I and your tether
right across the glass...

16:39.832 --> 16:42.824
(James) I'm in. That’s what I'm talking about.

16:47.048 --> 16:50.131
Look at that.
Unbelievable.

16:50.218 --> 16:52.960
Those are the leaded windows.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.761
Look at that.

16:55.848 --> 16:59.557
Oh my God. Look at the preservation on that wood.

17:10.655 --> 17:15.775
That second Titanic expedition brought together a core team that’s lasted over a decade.

17:15.867 --> 17:19.986
Andrew Wight has run all our expeditions since 200 1.

17:20.080 --> 17:24.744
And Ron Allum is the genius tech guru who has built the gear.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.541
Our next target
would take us even deeper.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.132
The battleship Bismarck.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.180
The infamous
German battleship was sunk

17:39.267 --> 17:43.055
in one of the most furious naval battles of World War ll.

17:43.104 --> 17:46.596
Now it lies
in 16,000 feet of water.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.773
(James on radio) Yeah, copy. We are heading aft

17:48.859 --> 17:51.976
over the starboard secondary turrets. Over.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.357
(James narrating)
The guns are silent now...

17:54.448 --> 17:57.440
but seem ever on guard.

17:57.535 --> 18:00.743
it’s a grim place.

18:00.830 --> 18:04.698
The whole ship somehow
preserved in the underworld

18:04.792 --> 18:07.875
as a monument
to the madness of war.

18:07.962 --> 18:11.705
(James on radio) We are right over the swastika. Over.

18:14.010 --> 18:18.299
Okay, Elwood’s out.
I'm on the move.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.471
Okay, that could be a way in.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.139
You see that
shell hole right there?

18:22.226 --> 18:24.137
I'm going to try
to go in this hole, okay?

18:24.228 --> 18:26.935
This is going to be tight.

18:27.023 --> 18:33.394
Okay. Just inside this door should be the adjutant’s office.

18:33.487 --> 18:36.445
(James narrating) We were able to identify a few specific rooms

18:36.490 --> 18:39.482
but mostly we just found
total destruction.

18:39.577 --> 18:42.910
The armor piercing shells
just tore the interior apart.

18:42.997 --> 18:45.238
Geez.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.618
This is devastating.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.285
Okay, there’s
the starboard propeller.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.543
So, the hit from the torpedo
should be right above us.

18:59.597 --> 19:03.590
That is for sure a hole
right above the rudder.

19:03.684 --> 19:06.471
Okay.
So, that’s our torpedo hole.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.385
(James narrating) Our forensic work got the attention

19:08.481 --> 19:10.346
of the deep exploration
community

19:10.441 --> 19:12.477
and we started
to gain some credibility,

19:12.568 --> 19:15.776
you know, all these institutional guys in academia

19:15.863 --> 19:18.445
that have this very sophisticated oceanographic equipment

19:18.532 --> 19:20.614
are kind of looking
over at our stuff saying,

19:20.701 --> 19:23.613
"They have that?
We don’t even have that."

19:23.663 --> 19:25.824
The question is
am I a filmmaker

19:25.915 --> 19:27.655
who does exploration
on the side

19:27.750 --> 19:30.366
or am I an explorer
who does filming on the side?

19:38.719 --> 19:41.335
(Suzy) When he decided ultimately to do Avatar,

19:41.430 --> 19:44.342
he was really
debating back and forth,

19:44.433 --> 19:49.223
was he going to quit directing
as a Hollywood director

19:49.313 --> 19:51.929
and just go do expeditions,

19:52.024 --> 19:54.811
which was something he--
he loves it

19:54.902 --> 19:58.486
He lives it. He breathes it. I mean, he loves making films, too.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.437
But there’s
something about--

20:00.533 --> 20:02.148
about Jim and the sea.

20:02.243 --> 20:05.576
Look at this thing.
It’s incredible.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.372
My problem is I'm curious.

20:10.459 --> 20:15.374
I'm a curious monkey and I need to go see for myself, you know.

20:15.464 --> 20:19.298
I've seen some pretty astonishing things in the depths,

20:19.385 --> 20:22.172
things that fill
your soul with wonder.

20:25.933 --> 20:29.050
What always gets me
is how life adapts.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.806
It can adapt
to the crushing pressure.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.512
It can adapt
to the absolute darkness.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.848
It can feed off jets of water

20:35.943 --> 20:39.026
that are hot enough
to melt lead.

20:43.492 --> 20:46.950
But the question is, can life adapt to the ultimate pressure

20:47.037 --> 20:51.246
36,000 feet down?
Maybe.

20:51.333 --> 20:55.246
The only way to know is to go down there and take a look.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.710
(Walt) We first met Jim on The Abyss 25 years ago.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.466
He was maniacally
focused and driven

21:06.557 --> 21:11.301
and now I think he actually enjoys inspiring the group.

21:11.395 --> 21:14.057
He’s trying to reach
the state of perfection

21:14.148 --> 21:17.982
and achievement and he wants everyone to kind of rise to that level.

21:18.068 --> 21:21.401
(James) Pushing people is not about yelling at them.

21:21.489 --> 21:24.652
it’s about creating goals
that are achievable,

21:24.742 --> 21:27.074
whether they think
the y’re achievable or not.

21:27.161 --> 21:30.653
Yeah, the only reason we’re filling it is so we can pressure test the things

21:30.748 --> 21:33.330
because we need to start this pressure qualification process.

21:33.417 --> 21:38.377
We’ve never controlled a J-box from the pack, but the J-box-- Why not?

21:38.464 --> 21:41.672
Because we haven’t got to that stage in the integration yet.

21:41.759 --> 21:45.251
Every single time you’ve gone up a tier in the architecture

21:45.346 --> 21:48.463
you’ve had to pull everything apart and solder resisters.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.299
What makes you think it’s going to be any different now?

21:51.393 --> 21:52.724
I designed the J-boxes.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.221
Ooh.

21:57.316 --> 22:01.935
You just stuck
your neck out so far.

22:02.029 --> 22:05.772
This isn’t an option for him.
He has to do it.

22:05.866 --> 22:08.027
it’s such
an internal drive for him

22:08.118 --> 22:12.487
that once he’s started that train, it’s not going to stop.

22:12.581 --> 22:16.039
We’re coming to that funnel where... Everything needs to be done at once.

22:16.126 --> 22:18.663
(Dave) We got five people want in this sphere at one time.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.619
But only one person
can work in it.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.670
Five people want
the lower pod at one time,

22:22.758 --> 22:26.000
but there’s only
one person can work in it.

22:26.095 --> 22:27.801
We’re not project
planning no more.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.254
What we’re doing is we’re firefighting. Yeah.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.386
They're all tired. The y’re all working 16-hour days.

22:33.477 --> 22:37.766
To say that our team is not ready yet to go out to sea is an understatement.

22:37.857 --> 22:42.692
We’re so far from ready
it’s not even funny.

22:42.778 --> 22:47.021
Our biggest enemy
at the moment is time.

22:47.116 --> 22:49.983
(James)Well, we obviously
underestimated the systems integration.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.534
So the new deadline
is February 6th.

22:52.621 --> 22:56.034
Come hell or high water,
that’s when we 're sailing.

22:59.336 --> 23:02.499
Nobody outside the project
has seen Deepsea Challenger

23:02.590 --> 23:06.174
and the first to do so
is Don Walsh,

23:06.260 --> 23:10.048
the only living person who’s been to the world’s deepest spot.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.175
And by crazy coincidence,
he’s arriving

23:12.266 --> 23:15.053
on the anniversary
of his famous dive.

23:15.144 --> 23:17.681
This is Kawasaki
racing green.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.432
These are
racing colors, baby.

23:19.523 --> 23:22.686
You had seen
conceptual drawings.

23:22.776 --> 23:25.609
You had an idea and you knew that it was underway.

23:25.696 --> 23:29.063
What is your reaction
to this?

23:29.158 --> 23:33.777
Oh, I'm very excited. I mean, what took you so long? 52 years, I mean...

23:33.871 --> 23:35.111
To the day.
Where have you been?

23:35.205 --> 23:36.741
To the day.

23:36.790 --> 23:39.156
So, Don, do you have
any tips for Jim

23:39.251 --> 23:42.914
at about 20,000 feet
if he hears a crack?

23:43.005 --> 23:44.586
If you can hear it,
you're still alive,

23:44.673 --> 23:46.914
you might as well
keep on with the dive.

23:47.009 --> 23:49.000
You never hear the one that gets you.

23:51.013 --> 23:53.299
(Don) Jacques Piccard and myself made a dive

23:53.390 --> 23:55.722
to the deepest place
in the world oceans.

24:00.356 --> 24:03.689
The motivation was to test out a platform and not to do science.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.983
That would come later.

24:06.070 --> 24:09.608
And what better test than the ultimate depth in the ocean?

24:14.286 --> 24:18.325
Passing 3,800 fathoms.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.874
Coming up on 5,000 fathoms.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.210
[bang]

24:32.304 --> 24:34.761
What the hell
was that?

24:34.848 --> 24:36.839
(Jacques)
We are still descending.

24:36.934 --> 24:38.344
Turn everything off.

24:41.271 --> 24:44.980
(Don) At 30,000 feet, there was this huge bang

24:45.067 --> 24:48.355
and we didn’t know
what it was.

24:48.445 --> 24:51.482
I looked through the window
in the entrance hatch.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.189
You better come
take a look at this.

24:54.284 --> 24:59.119
And I could see this crack across that large acrylic window.

24:59.206 --> 25:03.165
In my opinion, this
is not a serious problem.

25:03.252 --> 25:05.413
There is no reason to ascend.

25:07.506 --> 25:08.666
Agreed.

25:08.757 --> 25:11.043
Uh-huh?
Uh-huh.

25:11.135 --> 25:14.127
(Don) So, if in fact there ’d been a pressure boundary failure,

25:14.221 --> 25:16.928
we would have been dead
before we knew it.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.177
There were
no indications of problems,

25:19.268 --> 25:22.305
so we decided
to continue on down.

25:22.396 --> 25:24.808
Okay.
I can see the bottom now.

25:24.898 --> 25:26.229
Coming up slowly.

25:28.235 --> 25:31.022
There it is. Looks like we found it, Jacques.

25:37.244 --> 25:39.781
After we landed, we stirred up a big cloud of sediment

25:39.872 --> 25:43.330
and it was just like somebody had painted the front of the window white.

25:43.417 --> 25:45.157
It was like looking
into a bowl of milk.

25:45.252 --> 25:47.163
C’est la vie.

25:50.841 --> 25:55.551
And after about 20 minutes, we realized it wasn’t going to go away very soon.

25:58.974 --> 26:02.887
So we had 5 hours 15 minutes down, 20 minutes on the bottom,

26:02.978 --> 26:05.720
and about 3 hours
coming back up.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.744
And the purpose of this
is to signal the fact

26:30.839 --> 26:35.674
that we’re transitioning from building a sub to operating a sub.

26:35.761 --> 26:40.255
So, Andrew Wight came up with a crazy, potentially brilliant idea

26:40.349 --> 26:42.385
that since
we’re heading to Guam

26:42.476 --> 26:44.341
to dive the Challenger Deep,

26:44.436 --> 26:46.802
we’re going to be going right through Papua New Guinea.

26:46.897 --> 26:49.980
There happens to be a spot.
They call it Jacquinot Bay.

26:50.067 --> 26:53.150
This is a perfect place
to sea trial the sub.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.319
The thing that you’ve all got to start to realize now

26:55.405 --> 26:57.487
is that you're going
to have no support

26:57.574 --> 26:59.439
other than the people
that are around you.

26:59.535 --> 27:02.242
You’ve just got to now get
into a different mindset.

27:02.329 --> 27:05.696
So, whoever you're bunking with, be good friends,

27:05.791 --> 27:07.747
because you're going to be
with them for a while.

27:07.835 --> 27:10.793
If you snore,
well, too bad.

27:10.879 --> 27:13.120
Everybody here is here
because you're good.

27:13.215 --> 27:15.126
Because you're good
at what you do.

27:15.217 --> 27:17.458
And you’ve proven yourselves to the project.

27:17.553 --> 27:20.761
And we’re going to go out and do something truly extraordinary.

27:20.848 --> 27:24.056
There’s always a ramp up right before the expedition leaves.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.679
There’s an acceleration
of energy

27:25.769 --> 27:27.305
and a lot
of last minute problems

27:27.396 --> 27:29.637
as everything’s
coming together.

27:29.731 --> 27:32.063
We’re running a race and you just have that burst of energy

27:32.151 --> 27:34.267
comes from some where
and you just push hard.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.280
I think we got everybody.

27:48.667 --> 27:53.081
There are a lot of very worthy goals on this project,

27:53.172 --> 27:56.505
but one of them is just
the fun of the challenge.

27:56.592 --> 27:58.503
it’s the fun
of being able to say

27:58.594 --> 28:00.926
look what
a little group of people

28:01.013 --> 28:05.427
with no adult supervision can do if they put their minds to it.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.225
Who wants to dive
a sub today?

28:12.316 --> 28:15.274
Ar.
Ar. Exactly.

28:18.906 --> 28:21.989
All right. See you in the sunshine. God speed below.

28:36.924 --> 28:39.085
(John) And hold. Final checks.

28:45.057 --> 28:46.763
(James)
Lower away.

28:48.769 --> 28:49.884
Looking good.

28:55.567 --> 28:56.932
Starboard.

28:58.987 --> 29:00.648
(James) When the hatch gets bolted shut,

29:00.739 --> 29:02.730
there 's a moment
where you're suddenly

29:02.824 --> 29:05.907
in a very quiet,
very finite world.

29:05.994 --> 29:09.077
it’s like being
in a space capsule.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.664
(Dave on radio) Okay, Challenger, stand by to get wet.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.340
Yeah, roger that. Ready.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.220
Boosh.

29:27.307 --> 29:31.141
Hatch is secure.
No leaks.

29:31.228 --> 29:36.894
Please make a note that the camera pan tilt, the pan is wired backwards.

29:36.984 --> 29:38.895
COPY-

29:38.986 --> 29:41.693
I'm not getting a reading
on the altimeter at all.

29:41.780 --> 29:45.443
Should I be? Yeah, you should be. We’re looking into it.

29:49.204 --> 29:53.197
Okay, the camera boom
is also wired backwards.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.499
(Da ve) Your sonar head is upside down,

29:55.585 --> 29:58.622
therefore it will relay that information back to front.

29:58.714 --> 30:00.955
Okay. All right.
That explains that.

30:01.049 --> 30:06.419
So pretty much everything that can be wired backwards is wired backwards.

30:09.349 --> 30:13.262
Now, be advised temperature is 100 degrees. 100 degrees.

30:13.353 --> 30:16.311
We 're not having
a good time here.

30:16.398 --> 30:22.018
Okay, I think it’s time
to descend one meter. Over.

30:25.282 --> 30:26.692
Woohoo!

30:27.951 --> 30:29.987
S.O., do you copy? Over.

30:30.078 --> 30:32.069
[radio static]

30:36.710 --> 30:39.873
We can go ahead
and terminate this test dive

30:39.963 --> 30:44.332
because the A comms, while submerged, are not acceptable. Over.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.844
That’s the big dive. One meter. [laughing]

30:52.934 --> 30:55.016
Okay, so the test
in Sydney Harbour

30:55.103 --> 30:58.766
showed us exactly
how ready we 're not.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.893
Well, the compass worked.

31:00.984 --> 31:03.771
But we’ve got to get
out of the harbor

31:03.862 --> 31:06.023
and test the sub
in deeper water.

31:12.579 --> 31:14.115
[chatter]

31:17.876 --> 31:20.242
This dive
will also provide Mike

31:20.337 --> 31:24.501
with our first opportunity to film Deepsea Challenger underwater.

31:24.591 --> 31:27.378
Have fun.
Yeah, thanks.

31:27.469 --> 31:29.209
I mean, it’ll be fun
if everything works

31:29.262 --> 31:32.299
or even if 50 percent of it works. Exactly.

31:32.391 --> 31:35.007
All right. We’ll see you on the bottom.

31:35.102 --> 31:39.220
(Dave) Okay, trial dive ready to release.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.680
Standby to initiate descent.

31:41.775 --> 31:44.312
Release, release, release.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.612
[man]
See you later, buddy.

31:52.119 --> 31:54.235
Surface, surface.
Deepsea Challenger.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.115
Do you copy? Over?

31:56.206 --> 31:58.242
Copy that,
Deepsea Challenger.

31:58.333 --> 32:02.417
A comms signal is coming through strong and clear.

32:02.504 --> 32:07.498
Yeah, copy, surface. I am approaching the bottom, dropping shot to slow descent.

32:12.973 --> 32:16.215
200 units and down thrust in.
Just easing down.

32:20.105 --> 32:23.063
And touchdown.

32:23.150 --> 32:25.391
Surface, I am on the bottom.

32:25.485 --> 32:28.272
Depth 62 feet. Over.

32:28.363 --> 32:32.572
Super, super successful dive.
Everything worked.

32:32.659 --> 32:34.900
Yeah, you guys have pulled off a pretty amazing feat.

32:34.995 --> 32:37.361
You know, to have a second dive in the open ocean

32:37.456 --> 32:39.162
and for pretty much
everything to work,

32:39.249 --> 32:41.535
in the history of manned
submersible operations,

32:41.626 --> 32:43.116
is pretty much unheard of.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.701
Well done.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.161
(James)
I'm proud of the team.

32:46.256 --> 32:48.338
They really came through.

32:48.425 --> 32:50.381
We 're ready to sail.

32:53.054 --> 32:56.012
Hollywood director James Cameron has paid tribute

32:56.099 --> 32:59.262
to an Australian filmmaker
and his American colleague

32:59.352 --> 33:02.344
who were killed in a helicopter crash south of Sydney.

33:02.439 --> 33:04.771
Andrew was flying
his own helicopter

33:04.858 --> 33:07.019
with American filmmaker
Mike de Gruy

33:07.110 --> 33:09.101
when it crashed
just after take off

33:09.196 --> 33:11.983
on this tiny airstrip
at Jaspers Brush.

33:12.032 --> 33:14.865
(John) I found out about Andre w’s accident,

33:14.951 --> 33:18.785
you know, I was
busy organizing things.

33:18.872 --> 33:22.490
I remember Jim walking
straight across the deck to me

33:22.584 --> 33:25.621
and he looked at me and he said, "Dive’s aborted. "

33:25.712 --> 33:28.749
I'll never forget
the look on his face. He--

33:28.840 --> 33:32.173
He went white as a sheet
and then he said,

33:32.260 --> 33:35.343
"We’ve lost Mike and Andre w. "

33:35.430 --> 33:39.139
Immediately after the accident,
I was just so sick at heart

33:39.226 --> 33:43.970
in general, that I just--
it just felt wrong

33:44.064 --> 33:46.100
to even be trying to continue.

33:54.658 --> 33:57.024
(Suzy) There was just such a devastation in his voice

33:57.118 --> 34:01.532
and I had never seen him...

34:01.623 --> 34:04.080
ever in that way.

34:04.167 --> 34:07.079
(James) Andrew and Mike were like family to me.

34:07.170 --> 34:10.253
They were
my deep sea brothers

34:10.340 --> 34:13.706
and true explorers.

34:13.802 --> 34:18.216
It just went chomp. I was literally inside the jaws of the shark.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.388
Can’t get any closer.
It was incredible.

34:20.475 --> 34:23.717
There was just this big rip
across the fabric of reality

34:23.812 --> 34:25.928
for these families and you think, ’'Is this worth it?"

34:26.022 --> 34:27.853
Maybe just risks
shouldn’t be taken.

34:27.940 --> 34:31.684
Maybe the consequences
to our families are too great.

34:31.777 --> 34:33.860
I think the one thing
I've learned from all of this

34:33.947 --> 34:38.940
is don’t leave things
to deal with later, you know?

34:39.034 --> 34:42.027
If you love people and you want to spend time with them, then do it.

34:42.121 --> 34:47.583
Don’t put it off till later
because it's--

34:47.668 --> 34:49.784
It just goes.
It just goes in a heartbeat.

34:53.675 --> 34:57.167
(James) Over the next, I want to say 24 to 48 hours,

34:57.262 --> 35:00.095
there just seemed
to be this sense

35:00.181 --> 35:04.515
that the way to give
the situation meaning

35:04.603 --> 35:09.097
was not to walk away and have it have been for nothing.

35:09.190 --> 35:10.930
Just how do we do it?

35:11.026 --> 35:12.516
How do we muster up
the strength?

35:12.611 --> 35:14.476
How do we put
the pieces back together?

35:16.406 --> 35:19.739
We set up a war room
and we got real serious.

35:19.826 --> 35:22.192
And the funny thing
was that everybody stepped up.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.624
I hate it when people say, ''It’s what they would have wanted. "

35:30.712 --> 35:36.173
But, frankly, they’d both kick my ass if we wimped out now.

35:36.259 --> 35:40.298
it’s the right thing to do,
to give purpose and meaning

35:40.388 --> 35:44.597
to what Andrew and Mike
stood for as explorers.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.345
So we’re on our way
to Papua New Guinea,

35:50.440 --> 35:52.146
to the New Britain Trench,

35:52.233 --> 35:54.269
where we’re going
to do our test dives,

35:54.361 --> 35:56.727
going progressively
deeper and deeper.

36:13.713 --> 36:16.295
This place is everything
Andrew promised,

36:16.383 --> 36:18.590
calm deep water
right offshore,

36:18.677 --> 36:20.292
sheltered by the island.

36:20.387 --> 36:22.969
These are perfect
diving conditions.

36:25.392 --> 36:28.054
The shadow of the accident
is still hanging over us.

36:28.144 --> 36:32.353
There’s this sense of dread and a feeling that we’re just not ready.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.726
Let's dive.

36:34.818 --> 36:37.901
And that’s exactly when you’ve got to push through it.

36:37.987 --> 36:39.818
Right now
these guys need a win.

36:39.906 --> 36:42.739
We need to get
a deep dive under our beIts

36:42.826 --> 36:46.910
and then maybe we can face going all the way to Challenger Deep.

36:46.996 --> 36:49.032
See you in the sunshine.

36:49.124 --> 36:50.739
Coming UP-

36:53.294 --> 36:55.535
Okay, it’s on you, Steve.
Nice and slow.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.837
Sometimes you have to push and you have to make that dive,

36:57.924 --> 36:59.664
even if you think
you're not ready.

36:59.759 --> 37:02.091
[chatter]

37:02.178 --> 37:04.840
That gives people
a sense of accomplishment.

37:04.931 --> 37:08.799
They'll come back and say,
"We did it guys, "you know?

37:08.893 --> 37:10.474
"Look What We did. "

37:10.562 --> 37:12.723
Okay, standby
for the transition, guys.

37:12.814 --> 37:15.430
(James) Whether we achieve our ultimate goal or not,

37:15.525 --> 37:19.484
I think we’ve all learned
an incredible amount

37:19.571 --> 37:23.530
about each other and how
you work together as a team.

37:23.616 --> 37:25.072
And here we go.

37:27.996 --> 37:30.738
(Dave) Keep it coming, Donny. Keep it coming.

37:35.336 --> 37:38.453
Deepsea Challenger, standby
to rotate to dive position.

37:38.548 --> 37:40.413
Yeah, copy that.

37:40.508 --> 37:43.796
One minute to target area.

37:43.887 --> 37:45.093
COP)’-

37:52.187 --> 37:54.678
Deepsea Challenger,
you're on target now.

37:54.773 --> 37:57.185
On target now.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.266
(James) Wait, one, I just got to do final checks.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.691
Okay, final checks.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.771
Vision one.
18 percent O2.

38:03.865 --> 38:07.778
CO2 is 0.3 percent.

38:07.869 --> 38:10.281
Scrubber fan is running.

38:10.371 --> 38:13.659
To ward B bus, the lowest bus at 87 percent. Looking good.

38:13.750 --> 38:16.708
Depth gauge is working.
Compass is working.

38:16.795 --> 38:17.955
Now, wait, one.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.706
Okay, ready for descent.
Are you ready?

38:22.801 --> 38:25.383
Yeah, Deepsea Challenger,
whenever you're ready

38:25.470 --> 38:27.256
we ’II initiate launch.

38:27.347 --> 38:28.883
(James)
Okay, here we go.

38:28.973 --> 38:31.840
And release, release, release.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.929
Deepsea Challenger,
you are now released.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.639
Safe travels. (James) See you.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.407
I think my heart rate’s up
a little bit at the moment

38:49.494 --> 38:53.954
that I tell them to release the sub and I start to drop.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.531
But right away
there’s so many things to do,

38:56.626 --> 38:59.333
establishing communications
and all that.

38:59.420 --> 39:03.459
Surface, Deepsea Challenger,
do you copy? Over.

39:05.802 --> 39:11.889
Deepsea Challenger, A comms Mermaid, how do you copy? Over.

39:11.975 --> 39:15.058
Copy you, John, loud and clear.
You have a good comms voice.

39:15.144 --> 39:18.887
Copy that. The skipper says it’s like I'm talking to my grandma.

39:18.982 --> 39:21.143
Do you want a biscuit?

39:25.446 --> 39:27.402
Surface Deepsea Challenger,

39:27.490 --> 39:34.862
I'm at 2,873 feet,
vertical speed 1.4 knots.

39:34.956 --> 39:37.743
Okay, I'm going
to drop some shot.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.582
.6 knots.
Okay, definitely slowing down.

39:46.676 --> 39:49.543
Should be seeing something
pretty soon.

39:49.637 --> 39:51.298
Ah ha.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.595
That's it.

39:52.682 --> 39:54.923
Definitely have bottom.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.935
Cool terrain coming up here.

40:03.026 --> 40:05.642
Slowing.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.406
Contact.

40:12.493 --> 40:15.781
Surface, Deepsea Challenger,
I am on the bottom.

40:15.872 --> 40:21.663
Depth 3,074 feet. Over.

40:21.753 --> 40:26.087
Deepsea Challenger, copy that.
You are on the bottom.

40:31.763 --> 40:36.132
The lander is 250 meters.

40:36.225 --> 40:38.307
(James) Yeah, hang on. I'm just learning

40:38.394 --> 40:41.056
how to fly this thing
over the bottom.

40:41.147 --> 40:43.763
I have good control
of the vehicle

40:43.858 --> 40:46.315
and I seem to be
in a stable hover.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.900
Coming back around south.

40:54.535 --> 40:56.025
Oh, great.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.985
Big holothurian.

40:59.916 --> 41:02.453
Wow, he’s gorgeous.

41:02.543 --> 41:07.458
Nice.

41:07.548 --> 41:11.006
Whoa! He’s attacking me!

41:11.094 --> 41:13.756
Boosh.
Oh, he’s not digging that.

41:13.846 --> 41:16.758
Sorry about
the thruster, buddy.

41:16.849 --> 41:20.182
That is a big sea cucumber.

41:20.269 --> 41:23.102
He has no idea
how beautiful he is.

41:26.567 --> 41:29.229
What the heck are you?

41:29.320 --> 41:32.312
Oh yeah, polychaete.

41:32.407 --> 41:35.149
Basically I get so carried away shooting the critters

41:35.243 --> 41:37.529
that I forget
I’ve got work to do.

41:37.620 --> 41:40.862
I need to get good
with the manipulator arm.

41:40.957 --> 41:42.913
We’re not just
out here doing test dives.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.117
We’re doing science, too,
as we’re going along.

41:45.211 --> 41:47.873
So I've got to get
some rock samples.

41:47.964 --> 41:52.754
Otherwise the science team aren’t going to be happy campers.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.084
Gotcha.

41:56.764 --> 41:58.425
All right.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.552
My first sample.

42:01.728 --> 42:03.309
I'm proud of it.

42:04.897 --> 42:07.889
I am at the lander. Over.

42:09.694 --> 42:11.434
And we also built a lander.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.315
it’s this unmanned
science vehicle

42:13.406 --> 42:17.615
that basically
just free falls to the bottom.

42:17.702 --> 42:20.318
it’s got lights
and high resolution cameras

42:20.413 --> 42:24.201
and it can take
water samples and so on.

42:24.292 --> 42:25.907
it’s even got
this arm that drops down

42:26.002 --> 42:27.913
with a baited trap
so it can attract

42:28.004 --> 42:30.290
all the bottom foragers
from miles around.

42:36.679 --> 42:39.671
Lander is released.
On ascent. Over.

42:45.188 --> 42:47.645
I think of human knowledge
as being our headlights

42:47.732 --> 42:49.723
and the y’re shining out
into the darkness,

42:49.817 --> 42:52.980
and right beyond those lights
is something else.

42:53.071 --> 42:56.313
And all we have to do is move forward a little bit more

42:56.407 --> 42:58.068
and that truth
will be revealed,

42:58.159 --> 43:01.026
or that new disco very
will be revealed.

43:21.682 --> 43:25.345
Deepsea Challenger,
confirm request to ascend.

43:25.436 --> 43:26.596
COPY-

43:26.687 --> 43:28.052
Weights are coming off.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.347
There you go.

43:42.703 --> 43:46.036
Vehicle is very stable
at 5.6 knots.

43:55.508 --> 43:59.672
[cheering]

43:59.762 --> 44:02.003
Deepsea Challenger,
surface contact.

44:02.098 --> 44:04.214
Copy you, S.O.
We’re here.

44:04.308 --> 44:06.799
(Dave) All right. it’s always good to see you back.

44:06.894 --> 44:09.636
We ’ll get you-- we ’II come and get you underway and get you onboard.

44:09.730 --> 44:10.970
( James )
Copy that.

44:13.985 --> 44:15.475
(Da ve)
Okay. Steady!

44:17.655 --> 44:19.987
Goldy, take the line in!

44:20.074 --> 44:22.941
(James)
3, 300 feet.

44:23.035 --> 44:25.617
That’s like one-tenth
of where we’re going.

44:25.705 --> 44:29.539
But you know what? Right now, it’s the victory this team really needed.

44:32.837 --> 44:35.920
The curse of fear
has officially been lifted.

44:46.517 --> 44:48.883
We’re going to dive the New Britain trench again, but...

44:48.978 --> 44:52.846
I want to see this town of Rabaul that’s only a few miles away.

44:52.940 --> 44:54.805
Or see what’s left of it.

44:57.486 --> 45:00.728
In 1994, this town
of 17,000 people

45:00.823 --> 45:04.782
was utterly destroyed
by a volcanic eruption.

45:04.869 --> 45:09.363
An eruption caused by the same forces that formed the trench itself.

45:16.380 --> 45:18.712
This is where
my house used to be,

45:18.799 --> 45:21.415
and a couple of houses here are all-- This is all like a neighborhood?

45:21.510 --> 45:25.128
Were there a lot of houses here? Yeah. Quite a lot of houses here.

45:25.223 --> 45:28.306
What it did was just like, kind of like black smoke kind of thing.

45:28.392 --> 45:31.134
And when it did that,
it was all black.

45:31.229 --> 45:34.346
We couldn’t see. I had to touch you to know that you're there.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.476
(James)Amazing. (Francis) Yeah.

45:36.567 --> 45:40.230
We were diving just on the south side of New Britain Island,

45:40.321 --> 45:42.858
and we go out
about 30 miles offshore,

45:42.907 --> 45:48.368
and we can go down five miles in the trench, in the New Britain Trench.

45:48.454 --> 45:51.287
See, these deep trenches are formed when one plate of the Earth’s crust

45:51.374 --> 45:54.741
is dragged underneath another plate, right? Yeah.

45:54.835 --> 45:58.123
They call it subduction and it’s because the continents

45:58.214 --> 46:01.957
are all moving around
like these big rafts.

46:02.051 --> 46:05.259
The rock of the sea floor is grinding down underneath, right,

46:05.346 --> 46:08.964
under these billions of tons of rock overhead, and it melts.

46:09.058 --> 46:10.923
And the pressure
just builds and builds

46:11.018 --> 46:14.886
until all this magma
is pushed up ward and boom!

46:16.941 --> 46:19.808
So we came here and we saw,
wow, look at what these forces

46:19.902 --> 46:23.110
that are happening way down so many miles down in the Earth,

46:23.197 --> 46:27.566
look what they’re doing here and look at the consequence to human beings.

46:27.660 --> 46:30.697
We belong here, so best thing to do is just to play

46:30.788 --> 46:32.779
and get on with life,
I suppose.

46:36.627 --> 46:39.460
The same subduction forces that caused the Rabaul eruptions

46:39.547 --> 46:42.880
also unleash
undersea earthquakes.

46:42.967 --> 46:45.925
When that fault slips
in one of these deep trenches,

46:46.012 --> 46:48.003
it displaces
an enormous pulse of water.

46:50.599 --> 46:55.684
it’s a release of energy more than 3,000 times the Hiroshima bomb,

46:55.771 --> 46:57.682
creating a tsunami.

46:57.773 --> 47:00.059
[reporter speaking Japanese]

47:16.792 --> 47:19.499
We could save a lot of lives if we could predict these events,

47:19.587 --> 47:22.169
but we need to know a lot more about what’s happening

47:22.214 --> 47:24.500
down in these deep trenches.

47:24.550 --> 47:26.882
So we need the machines
that can go down there.

47:46.155 --> 47:49.192
Surface, Deepsea Challenger.
I am on the bottom.

47:49.283 --> 47:54.653
Depth is 12, 164 feet. Over.

48:00.795 --> 48:04.162
I'm two-and-a-haIf miles down,
same depth as Titanic,

48:04.256 --> 48:06.838
which I've been to
plenty of times,

48:06.926 --> 48:11.260
but always in subs that were built by big government programs.

48:11.347 --> 48:13.804
No privately built sub
has ever gone this deep.

48:15.768 --> 48:17.850
And then I've got
to remind myself,

48:17.937 --> 48:21.805
this is only a third of the way to where I'm going.

48:23.442 --> 48:26.184
Oh, got us a critter.

48:26.278 --> 48:28.894
We got us a real critter here.

48:28.989 --> 48:33.107
Yesiree, Bob.
Time to zoom in on this one.

48:33.202 --> 48:35.113
It looks like an octopus.

48:35.204 --> 48:38.662
Yeah, love those deep octopus.

48:38.749 --> 48:40.910
Wonder what the hell
he’s thinking.

48:41.001 --> 48:44.664
[snapping]
Uh oh, that’s not good.

48:44.755 --> 48:47.371
That’s not good.

48:47.466 --> 48:50.583
Loud snapping sounds not good.

48:50.678 --> 48:53.670
(James) Well, Don Walsh always says, if you hear a loud bang

48:53.764 --> 48:57.507
and you’ve got time to think about it, you're going to be okay.

48:57.601 --> 48:59.432
Something just imploded.

49:03.065 --> 49:06.353
He’s chasing me.
[laughs]

49:06.444 --> 49:08.856
You're a mighty warrior,
aren’t you?

49:18.581 --> 49:20.446
Each one
of these chance encounters

49:20.541 --> 49:23.453
is a gift from the ocean,
and I'm grateful.

49:26.046 --> 49:29.254
This is my church,
down here, alone.

49:29.341 --> 49:32.754
I feel the power
of nature’s imagination,

49:32.845 --> 49:35.427
which is so much
greater than our own.

49:54.033 --> 49:56.069
Here we are with
our high tech equipment,

49:56.160 --> 49:58.572
diving in one of the wildest places on the planet.

50:14.220 --> 50:16.131
The rainforests
of Papua New Guinea

50:16.222 --> 50:19.259
were the inspiration
for the landscapes in Avatar,

50:19.350 --> 50:22.183
so there’s no way I'm not going to go ashore and explore.

50:26.607 --> 50:28.268
[singing]

50:36.700 --> 50:38.907
We’ve been invited
by the Baining people

50:38.994 --> 50:41.280
to witness
their sacred fire dance.

50:45.125 --> 50:50.085
The ceremony suggests to me the spirits of this land, shaped by fire...

50:53.133 --> 50:56.500
by the powerful and dangerous forces deep in the Earth.

50:58.639 --> 51:01.722
But the spirit world doesn’t
cause the Earth to erupt..

51:04.270 --> 51:07.979
or cause the sea
to rise up in a tsunami.

51:08.065 --> 51:12.058
The only true path to understanding nature is science.

51:14.863 --> 51:16.774
That’s why we’re out here.

51:16.865 --> 51:18.480
That’s why we’re diving.

51:23.330 --> 51:25.662
[man]
In clear feet, clear four.

51:28.586 --> 51:32.579
Today’s dive is 27,000 feet,
over five miles down.

51:32.673 --> 51:37.667
So this is the big test before we can go on to Challenger Deep.

51:37.761 --> 51:40.343
And we’re going to start to squeeze all the submersible systems

51:40.431 --> 51:42.672
with this extreme pressure.

51:42.766 --> 51:45.849
We’re also going to go to the limits of our communications

51:45.936 --> 51:47.472
and tracking.

51:47.563 --> 51:50.646
Pull in that line!
Oh, no.

51:50.733 --> 51:53.315
Guys, getting pretty
close to the ship here.

51:53.402 --> 51:55.017
That's not good.

51:55.112 --> 51:56.352
She's getting close.

51:58.032 --> 51:59.192
Hold it there!

52:01.243 --> 52:03.279
GUYS, guys, guys, come on.

52:05.664 --> 52:08.201
Guys, I'm looking right
into the starboard props here.

52:08.292 --> 52:10.157
Keep it coming.

52:10.252 --> 52:11.367
Keep it tight.

52:16.884 --> 52:19.000
I'll bet
they didn’t intend that.

52:23.349 --> 52:25.681
And release, release, release.

52:36.945 --> 52:39.937
(James narrating) When the dive begins, it’s exciting.

52:40.032 --> 52:43.775
You know, the divers become
little tiny stick figures

52:43.869 --> 52:46.906
and everything just
kind of disappears.

52:46.997 --> 52:49.534
And then you just
go into darkness.

52:49.625 --> 52:52.037
You can see the plankton
going by and...

52:52.127 --> 52:55.119
and you just fall
for a long, long time.

52:57.007 --> 52:59.999
Everybody says I can’t
stretch my arms out in here.

53:00.094 --> 53:03.552
I can stretch
to there and to there.

53:05.349 --> 53:08.637
I’II be at 18,000 feet
here in a second.

53:08.727 --> 53:12.390
It’s the depth Bud Brigman
went to in The Abyss.

53:12.481 --> 53:15.939
I'm doing it for real.

53:16.026 --> 53:18.187
It’s cool.

53:18.278 --> 53:21.770
Surface, Deepsea Challenger,
do you copy? Over.

53:26.203 --> 53:30.412
Surface, Deepsea Challenger,
do you copy? Over?

53:30.499 --> 53:33.536
[man] A comms, we’re still receiving Deepsea Challenger

53:33.627 --> 53:36.209
but he is not acknowledging
our transmission. Over.

53:36.296 --> 53:37.456
Yeah. Copy.

53:37.548 --> 53:40.039
I've got no voice comms.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.132
Okay,
that’s not too promising.

53:45.222 --> 53:48.635
He’s not hearing us
or responding to us.

53:48.726 --> 53:50.466
Depth gauge is not changing.

53:50.561 --> 53:52.847
[th rusters stop]
Whoa.

53:52.938 --> 53:54.974
Just lost my thrusters.

53:55.065 --> 53:58.023
Oh, see, look, this is not good. This is not good.

53:58.110 --> 54:02.399
My thrusters are running away
and they won’t respond.

54:05.659 --> 54:07.024
Then they drive by themselves.

54:07.119 --> 54:09.075
I think we got a problem.

54:09.163 --> 54:13.372
Got a lot of failures here
and I'm coming up to my depth.

54:13.459 --> 54:17.668
Without thrusters I can’t even stop. This is not good.

54:17.755 --> 54:22.875
As I'm going along, things are starting to fail and glitch one by one.

54:22.968 --> 54:26.131
Everything’s getting haywire and I'm getting deeper and deeper.

54:26.221 --> 54:30.134
My cIock’s stopped, my depth gauge has stopped, everything’s stopped.

54:30.225 --> 54:34.434
Speed’s 1.9 knots. I still can’t stop from that. I'll hit the bottom too fast.

54:34.521 --> 54:37.058
I've got just a couple
of minutes to sort this out.

54:37.149 --> 54:39.390
We need to really know, Tim,
if there’s an emergency.

54:39.485 --> 54:42.727
This is going to be a mess. Yeah, A comms Mermaid, A comms Rib,

54:42.821 --> 54:45.028
we have received telemetry
but no vitals.

54:45.115 --> 54:47.572
I'm going to have to drop some shot. I'm going too fast.

54:47.659 --> 54:49.991
I'm going 2 knots.

54:50.078 --> 54:52.911
And dropping shot, here we go.

54:52.998 --> 54:57.992
270 feet. He’s getting really close.

54:58.086 --> 54:59.826
oh, [bleep].

54:59.922 --> 55:01.378
S’[0P'

55:04.927 --> 55:10.047
Surface, Deepsea Challenger.
Descent is aborted.

55:10.140 --> 55:12.927
Hey, about time.
Finally.

55:16.605 --> 55:19.893
I mean, down at 27, 000 feet
and one system goes,

55:19.983 --> 55:22.474
and then another system goes,
and then another system goes.

55:22.569 --> 55:27.859
And pretty soon you realize you're in this kind of dead metal coffin,

55:27.950 --> 55:30.942
and if the weights don’t come off, you're toast.

55:31.036 --> 55:32.617
okaY-

55:35.707 --> 55:36.947
Moment of truth.

55:49.471 --> 55:51.007
[cheering]

55:56.812 --> 56:01.806
The good news is it’s now officially the deepest diving submersible in the world.

56:01.900 --> 56:04.232
Bad news is,
never saw the bottom,

56:04.319 --> 56:06.856
had about five major
systems failures

56:06.947 --> 56:08.653
that prevented me
from going on.

56:08.740 --> 56:11.026
Now, what we’ve got to do
is go through the tape,

56:11.118 --> 56:13.985
and see exactly what the nature of the failure was.

56:16.331 --> 56:19.118
We did take water ingress in a couple of battery modules.

56:19.209 --> 56:21.416
So these are going to have
to be taken off the sub

56:21.503 --> 56:26.167
and repaired or replaced
before the next dive.

56:26.258 --> 56:31.093
This is a prototype and even though we might have 100 percent spares on items,

56:31.179 --> 56:35.172
we’re working through those items as we have problems on the dive.

56:35.267 --> 56:39.681
We could come to a point where I could say, "I can’t repair this."

56:39.771 --> 56:41.511
(James) When you do this kind of project,

56:41.607 --> 56:43.973
you hit so many hurdles.

56:44.067 --> 56:47.651
Well, I have to say, guys, I picked you guys because you're smart

56:47.738 --> 56:49.774
and you can do this.

56:49.865 --> 56:52.857
And we’re going to hit hurdles like this where we think

56:52.951 --> 56:54.782
we’re stopped,
that we’re dead in the water.

56:54.870 --> 56:56.701
And we’re going
to think our way through it.

57:20.228 --> 57:22.389
Touchdown.

57:22.481 --> 57:25.268
Surface, I am on the bottom.

57:25.359 --> 57:31.355
Depth, 26, 970 feet.

57:31.448 --> 57:33.655
Lights are working.

57:33.742 --> 57:35.482
Cameras working.

57:35.577 --> 57:37.408
Thrusters working.

57:37.496 --> 57:38.906
We did it, guys.

57:38.997 --> 57:41.238
A lot of very happy
Pe0p|e up here.

57:44.002 --> 57:46.539
(James) So I'm five miles down in the New Britain Trench,

57:46.630 --> 57:49.337
a place that’s never
been explored before.

57:49.424 --> 57:52.040
Oh, what's that?

57:52.135 --> 57:57.801
And, bang, right off the bat I find what could be a new species of jellyfish.

58:04.356 --> 58:06.768
[radio chatter]

58:09.653 --> 58:11.393
(James)
Copy you loud and clear.

58:11.488 --> 58:13.353
I'm at the trench wall.

58:13.448 --> 58:17.032
I am working a steep rock cliff. Over.

58:20.664 --> 58:24.907
Alps covered with snow. [Radio] Copy that. Over.

58:25.002 --> 58:26.333
That's cool.

58:28.839 --> 58:31.626
Tiny little anemones

58:31.717 --> 58:34.550
growing out of the rocks.

58:34.636 --> 58:36.797
Look at that, huh?

58:36.888 --> 58:38.970
A beautiful little garden

58:39.057 --> 58:42.174
just hanging out here
at 27, 000 feet.

58:49.067 --> 58:51.524
So we’ve discovered
this diverse ecosystem

58:51.611 --> 58:54.523
living five miles down
in the New Britain Trench.

58:56.950 --> 58:59.817
But the biggest surprise
comes from the lander

58:59.911 --> 59:02.323
when we see what was
attracted to our bait.

59:02.414 --> 59:04.871
Holy cow.

59:04.958 --> 59:06.289
Amazing.

59:07.669 --> 59:09.876
Wow.
This is really amazing.

59:09.963 --> 59:13.376
This whole trip we’ve only caught a trickle of small tiny amphipods,

59:13.467 --> 59:17.927
maybe an isopod here or there. Now we've many dozens of giant amphipods.

59:18.013 --> 59:20.629
(James) On one dive, the lander brings back four species

59:20.724 --> 59:23.090
which might be new to science.

59:23.185 --> 59:27.975
That really paid off. I mean, that’s pretty amazing. I just can’t believe it.

59:30.317 --> 59:32.558
(James) On the lander camera, it’s a feeding frenzy.

59:32.652 --> 59:36.361
The y’re like deep sea piranha
devouring that chicken.

59:36.448 --> 59:38.905
Oh. Look at that.

59:38.992 --> 59:41.074
Yeah, that is clean
to the bone.

59:41.161 --> 59:44.653
This was a full chicken. But look at this.

59:44.748 --> 59:47.660
Look how neatly they've picked every-- It's perfectly clean.

59:47.751 --> 59:49.867
morsel of flesh
off that skeleton.

59:49.961 --> 59:51.451
Look at that.
Absolutely perfect.

59:51.546 --> 59:52.581
I mean,
that's nice work.

59:55.926 --> 59:58.633
The five mile dive
was our last test.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.962
We’re as ready
as we’re going to be.

01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:06.050
it’s time to go
to the deep end of the pool.

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:09.887
The Challenger Deep is in the heart of the Mariana Trench.

01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:12.563
It’s 1,300 miles
farther north.

01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:15.814
it’s a pit in the trench 40 miles long and two miles wide

01:00:15.904 --> 01:00:19.863
that’s so deep, you could put Mount Everest on the bottom,

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:22.692
with four Empire State buildings stacked on top

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:24.822
and not even
break the surface.

01:00:35.006 --> 01:00:36.871
Okay, so we’re coming up
on the dive site,

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:38.753
and we’ve got a problem.

01:00:38.844 --> 01:00:40.960
We were supposed to be
out here a month ago

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:43.340
and now the trade winds
are blowing every day

01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:47.515
and the sea state
has gotten pretty ugly.

01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:50.309
I’ve been dreaming about this place since I was a little kid.

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:55.016
You know it’s interesting. It just looks like any other piece of ocean anywhere.

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:58.694
But it’s knowing that seven miles straight down below our feet

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:02.773
is the deepest place
in the world’s oceans.

01:01:02.868 --> 01:01:05.359
But conditions
are pretty marginal.

01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:06.989
Probably about
the absolute limit

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.741
that we can
launch in right here.

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:11.073
This is going to test
everybody to the limit.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:14.160
(Dave)
Okay, let's stabilize her.

01:01:14.254 --> 01:01:16.290
(James) So we’re doing an unmanned launch

01:01:16.381 --> 01:01:19.123
to see if we can actually
get the sub back on the ship.

01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:23.051
Okay, just get lines
nice and tight. Steady.

01:01:23.138 --> 01:01:25.379
(James)
Ifit gets away on us...

01:01:25.473 --> 01:01:27.429
it’s a 12-ton wrecking ball.

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:30.850
(Da ve) Let her stabilize. Let her stabilize.

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:33.929
Goldy! Line out!

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:37.107
Steady now.
Get her steady.

01:01:37.194 --> 01:01:39.230
Take in all the slack.
All the slack.

01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:42.108
Come on, Harman, get it in.

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:46.317
Tighten her, Gavin.
Gavin, tight.

01:01:46.411 --> 01:01:50.245
All stop. Take her back to the sea, Steve, back in the sea.

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:52.414
Goldy, let your line out!

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.240
(James) The only way to stop it swinging

01:01:54.336 --> 01:01:55.701
is to drop it
back in the water.

01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:57.456
Keep it coming!

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.458
Goldy, let it out.
Let it out, please.

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:02.256
Everyone, let your lines out. All lines out.

01:02:02.344 --> 01:02:04.835
Get it out!

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.340
Okay, steady!

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:07.637
Hold it there.

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:12.259
(James)
We’re over the limit.

01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:14.390
If the sea state
doesn’t come do wn,

01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:16.722
there’s no way I can dive.

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:22.731
It’s just this
weather window.

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:26.280
It’s like a gift
from the sea right there.

01:02:26.368 --> 01:02:32.785
Gives us a shot. It’s already well down, mid afternoon down, holding.

01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:37.413
Past midnight and then zero six the following morning.

01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:40.871
That’s when it starts to rocket back up. So that’s our hard out.

01:02:46.304 --> 01:02:48.215
So now it’s finally
the big dive

01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:50.137
and we’re going
to launch at night

01:02:50.225 --> 01:02:53.717
in a heavy sea
which we never trained for.

01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:58.852
Knowing that somebody’s life is at stake is very, very stressful.

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:00.933
And then you compound that

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:04.235
with an incredibly
aggressive schedule.

01:03:04.322 --> 01:03:06.438
There are calculated risks.

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:08.239
(John)
Complacency is a killer.

01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:10.408
The ocean can turn on you
in a heartbeat.

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:14.329
So it’s very important that everybody is on their main game.

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:17.908
(Dave) Tie the tagIines. Tighten up. Tighten up.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:25.124
Gavin, tighten up.

01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:28.176
Okay, just get lines
nice and tight. Steady.

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:30.424
All lines stop.
All stop.

01:03:30.515 --> 01:03:36.932
(James) If we don’t dive now, then we’ve wasted our time.

01:03:37.022 --> 01:03:40.014
(Dave) Okay, steady there. Steady there.

01:03:40.108 --> 01:03:41.894
All stop, all stop.

01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:45.193
(James)
Because we’re out of time.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.396
This ship’s got to go back.

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:52.317
(Dave)
Steady.

01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:54.619
(James) We’ve got to dive, even if it means

01:03:54.706 --> 01:03:57.823
we’ve got to dive at night which we ’d said we wouldn’t do,

01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:59.407
even if it means
we’ve got to dive

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:01.834
in a two-and-a-haIf meter sea,

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:06.005
which we said
was beyond our capability.

01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:11.803
Now is where we really have to pit ourselves against the elements.

01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:20.395
And verticals down.

01:04:27.655 --> 01:04:31.193
Well, we’re supposed to be trying to dive by 0400, which is in 20 minutes.

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:32.774
I predict we’ll be about...

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:34.484
I'll be descending
by about 4:30.

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:36.945
A little bit late,
but not much.

01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:40.995
We’re on target right now.

01:04:41.086 --> 01:04:44.328
Should be the deepest place
on the planet.

01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:46.754
There’s of course
an element of fear in it,

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:51.551
because it’s a risk, and...

01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:56.215
but if you don’t go out and do something in life, nothing happens.

01:04:58.395 --> 01:05:00.602
I'm only minutes away from diving the Challenger Deep

01:05:00.688 --> 01:05:02.553
and the guy
who inspired that dream

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:05.061
is right here
on board with us.

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:07.893
Don Walsh is back
at the site of his own dive

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:09.978
52 years later.

01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:16.742
Thanks,babe.

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:18.411
Have fun.
It will be fun.

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:21.240
I love you.
Love you, too, babe.

01:05:23.294 --> 01:05:26.661
All right, Jim. All right, buddy. See you in the sunshine.

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:30.294
Okay. See you when you come out. All the best.All right. Thanks a lot.

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:34.003
Have a good one. God speed below. All right. Thanks a lot.

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:51.106
And pan tilt.

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:52.778
Yup. Got it.

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:57.654
And hold.
Final checks.

01:05:57.745 --> 01:05:59.030
Leads clear.

01:06:00.748 --> 01:06:02.409
Okay, lower away.

01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:20.932
(Da ve)
Okay, standby.

01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:32.318
Okay, Steve, when you're ready, mate. If you just take up.

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:34.441
Coming UP-
Coming UP-

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:41.076
Okay, Donny.

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:42.370
Nice and tight, Donny.

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:48.330
That’s a good angle, Donny. That’s great. Good. Well done, guys.

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:50.503
Take her off.
That's good.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:55.505
Okay, standby for that transition, guys. Standby for transition.

01:06:55.595 --> 01:06:58.758
You need to be
taking up, Gavin.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:01.760
[chatter]
Keep going, guys.

01:07:03.728 --> 01:07:05.889
Goldy, a bit more out, please.

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:07.891
Careful, Donny.
Out more, Donny.

01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:09.347
Here we go.

01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:14.356
(Tim) Deepsea Challenger, you are 100 meters

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:17.234
due north of your intended
drop point. Over.

01:07:17.325 --> 01:07:20.362
(James) Yeah, copy that, Tim. Thanks.

01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:21.818
Hatch is not leaking.

01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:24.074
Hatch looks good so far.

01:07:24.165 --> 01:07:26.702
(Tim) Yeah, Jim, we’re going to, if you're comfortable,

01:07:26.793 --> 01:07:29.330
we'll pump both bags together
once you're ready--

01:07:33.967 --> 01:07:36.629
(James)
Say again, please.

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:41.213
Deepsea Challenger,
five minutes from drop zone.

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:43.263
Copy, five minutes
from drop zone.

01:07:43.351 --> 01:07:45.558
Deepsea Challenger,
surface check.

01:07:45.645 --> 01:07:51.561
Yeah, copy that.
Vision 1 is 20-19-19.

01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:56.023
Carbon dioxide is 0.5 percent.

01:07:56.114 --> 01:07:57.945
Looking good, guys.

01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:02.367
Oh, man.

01:08:02.453 --> 01:08:06.071
We got a hatch deploy
on the soft ballast.

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:08.872
The soft ballast bag has deployed. The hatch popped.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.827
(Dave) Yeah roger, I’ve got that. I can see that.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:14.207
(James) The soft ballast is a key safety system.

01:08:14.299 --> 01:08:17.712
If it blows, we’re supposed to pull the sub out and fix it.

01:08:17.801 --> 01:08:21.169
But if we do that,
we miss our dive window.

01:08:24.892 --> 01:08:27.383
All right, tell the divers to cut it away.

01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:29.764
We’re going without it.
Over.

01:08:29.856 --> 01:08:31.595
(Dave)
Yeah, roger. Standby.

01:08:34.234 --> 01:08:36.647
Take everything.
The hatch, too. Over.

01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:40.981
Deepsea Challenger, position update is two minutes to drop point.

01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:47.825
All right, Deepsea Challenger,
ready when you are.

01:08:47.915 --> 01:08:49.779
Yeah, ready for a descent.

01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:52.412
Okay, just confirmed
the divers are in position

01:08:52.502 --> 01:08:53.868
and then
we’re going to launch.

01:08:53.962 --> 01:08:55.624
Okay, ready
to initiate descent.

01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:57.831
And release, release, release.

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:23.109
Had a bit of a rocky start.

01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:27.698
4.6 knots. We’re going like a bat out of hell here.

01:09:27.788 --> 01:09:29.279
Just the way we like it.

01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:36.999
Surface, surface,
Deepsea Challenger.

01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:43.086
Depth two tick
zero, zero feet.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:46.921
Speed 4.2 knots. Over.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:50.133
Deepsea Challenger, copy.
Understood.

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:54.516
Depth 11,580 feet.

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:56.393
Speed 3.2 knots.

01:09:58.903 --> 01:10:02.145
I used to think Titanic was the deepest place I could imagine.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.949
Now I'm sailing past that depth like it’s the foot of my drive way.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:13.077
16, 000 feet.

01:10:13.167 --> 01:10:15.032
That’s the depth of Bismarck,

01:10:15.128 --> 01:10:17.460
the deepest I'd been
before this expedition.

01:10:20.174 --> 01:10:23.462
But it’s less than halfway
to where I'm going.

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:25.885
Surface, Deepsea Challenger.

01:10:25.972 --> 01:10:30.762
Depth, 18,000.

01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:35.721
External temperature,
34. 4 degrees.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.686
It's getting cold.

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:51.240
You're doing all these things as you're going do wn, it’s all on the checklist.

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:53.867
You do this at this depth and you do that at another depth,

01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:56.574
and you know,
you're setting up the cameras

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:59.627
and booting up the sonar,
checking battery status,

01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:03.798
testing the thrusters,
comms, navigation.

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:07.753
Everything that needs
to be ready before you Iand.

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:10.930
And it’s all by the numbers.

01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:14.805
And then for the first time, on any dive, I'm through my checklist.

01:11:17.148 --> 01:11:19.434
27, 000 feet.

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:23.143
That’s deeper than any other sub in the world can reach.

01:11:23.237 --> 01:11:25.273
Beyond any hope of rescue.

01:11:27.492 --> 01:11:31.485
And there’s still
9,000 feet to go.

01:11:31.579 --> 01:11:33.535
There’s nothing to do
but sit and think

01:11:33.623 --> 01:11:36.080
about the pressure
building up on the hull.

01:11:40.338 --> 01:11:43.000
It just gets really quiet.

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:47.925
It’s peaceful.
It's lonely.

01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:51.880
And you feel yourself just getting farther and farther and farther

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:54.431
from the world
that you came from.

01:12:07.782 --> 01:12:12.776
Vertical rate is 1.3 knots.

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:17.239
Time to shed some shot.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:19.415
Get some speed off here.

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:28.003
35,200 feet.

01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:31.552
488 feet to go.

01:12:31.639 --> 01:12:33.800
Get everything on.

01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:35.597
On. Good.

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:39.052
And number three.
That’s all lights facing down.

01:12:39.146 --> 01:12:42.388
Let’s get
this spotlight aimed do wn.

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:49.772
Altitude 110 feet.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:52.653
100 feet.

01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:54.734
78.

01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:59.869
Should be seeing
something pretty soon.

01:12:59.959 --> 01:13:03.417
All the way down.

01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:05.870
There we go.

01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:07.501
We have bottom.

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:12.377
Okay.
Coming down.

01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:16.047
Easy, easy, 935)!-

01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:25.097
More braking.

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:40.120
Touchdown.

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:04.224
Surface, this is
Deepsea Challenger.

01:14:04.315 --> 01:14:06.180
I am on the bottom.

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:12.942
Depth is 35,756 feet.

01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:16.153
And life support’s good.

01:14:16.243 --> 01:14:18.609
Everything looks good.

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:20.865
Oh, my God.

01:14:24.001 --> 01:14:26.993
Whatever I thought I was going to say at that moment...

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:28.624
wasn’t going to be that.

01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:30.875
This is how the NASA team
must have felt

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:32.958
when the Eagle landed.
This is just great.

01:14:33.052 --> 01:14:35.714
(Suzy) Deepsea Challenger. Deepsea Challenger.

01:14:35.805 --> 01:14:38.968
God speed to you, baby.
I love you.

01:14:39.058 --> 01:14:45.099
Love you too, baby. All the way from the heart of the ocean.

01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:46.429
Oh!

01:14:52.446 --> 01:14:57.065
Surface be advised, I'm starting my transect to the north. Over.

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:13.794
Going deeper into the ocean is going deeper into the subconscious.

01:15:13.884 --> 01:15:20.175
So we have this fantasy that the deeper we are, the bigger the monsters.

01:15:20.266 --> 01:15:22.507
Man.

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:26.844
It is just
flat and featureless.

01:15:26.939 --> 01:15:29.146
Don't even
see any animal tracks.

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:34.025
In reality, the deeper we go,

01:15:34.113 --> 01:15:36.320
the smaller the life forms.

01:15:36.407 --> 01:15:40.150
No critters, no signs of critters. No tracks on the ground.

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:46.576
Unbelievable.
Like the moon.

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:50.455
I know there are new species
of bacteria in that sediment,

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:53.333
but I have this powerful feeling that I've dived deeper

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:55.790
than the limits
of life itself.

01:15:55.885 --> 01:16:01.221
All right, Iet’s get ourselves a sediment sample.

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:07.351
Be advised, I'm taking
my contingency sample. Over.

01:16:13.027 --> 01:16:16.360
I see a lot
of hydraulic oil coming out.

01:16:16.447 --> 01:16:19.314
Looks like
we got ourselves a big leak.

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:21.694
All right.

01:16:21.786 --> 01:16:25.028
I better get
my sample while I can.

01:16:25.122 --> 01:16:27.829
I think we might
have a sample there.

01:16:34.048 --> 01:16:37.586
Okay, now...

01:16:37.676 --> 01:16:40.167
Let’s get a look
at this watch.

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:43.504
Is it still ticking?

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:46.341
Oh yeah.
16,000 pounds per square inch?

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:47.925
No problem.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:51.141
Uh oh. This is not good.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:57.022
This thing is just dying.

01:16:57.113 --> 01:17:00.605
Yeah. The hydraulics are completely dead.

01:17:04.912 --> 01:17:07.028
Most of our lives,
we huddle together

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:10.411
in the warmth
of human company.

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:14.244
Down here, alone,
there’s a purity.

01:17:16.423 --> 01:17:19.335
We sense the vastness
of all that we don’t know.

01:17:21.804 --> 01:17:25.092
Oh, I think
my horizon just came up.

01:17:25.182 --> 01:17:28.015
IbeHeve
we have found a slope.

01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:31.310
Deepsea Challenger,
surface, comms check.

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:34.230
Surface, Deepsea Challenger.

01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:38.229
I am at the north slope. Over.

01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:43.230
That's cool.
Copy that.

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:45.316
Letloose
a little avalanche there.

01:17:56.422 --> 01:17:58.708
(James)
Somebody has to go.

01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:01.165
A robot can’t tell you
how it feels.

01:18:05.097 --> 01:18:08.555
I did not come all this way

01:18:08.642 --> 01:18:11.179
to not see it
with my own eyes.

01:18:14.815 --> 01:18:17.352
Oh yeah.

01:18:17.443 --> 01:18:20.310
(James narrating) it’s important to physically be here,

01:18:20.404 --> 01:18:23.066
to bear witness

01:18:23.157 --> 01:18:25.398
to the things that
have never been seen.

01:18:35.044 --> 01:18:38.878
To that little kid dreaming of going to the bottom of the ocean,

01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:41.000
all things seemed possible.

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:44.959
I wonder what
other kids will do.

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:47.966
Where they'll go,
what they'll see.

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:50.139
What new worlds await them.

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:53.184
Oh, yeah.

01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:55.636
I hope there's some kid
out there right now

01:18:55.731 --> 01:19:02.899
who's already dreaming of exploring worlds we can 't even imagine.

01:19:02.988 --> 01:19:05.274
Something feels wrong
with my thrusters.

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:10.489
Oh, see, look, I got
three dead horizontals.

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:14.739
All I can do is turn.
Turn in a circle.

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:19.793
Yeah, it just spins me around.

01:19:22.132 --> 01:19:24.464
It's time to go back
to my own world.

01:19:28.055 --> 01:19:32.970
Surface, Deepsea Challenger,
preparing to ascend. Over.

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:35.722
I hate this feeling,
when you've got to leave

01:19:35.813 --> 01:19:38.600
and you know there's still
so much to see out there.

01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:40.181
Weights are coming off.

01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:44.727
Boosh.
There they go.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.231
Surface, Deepsea Challenger.

01:19:48.325 --> 01:19:51.442
Weights are off.
On ascent. Over.

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:09.002
(James narrating) Well, I'm just going to have to come back.

01:20:09.096 --> 01:20:11.052
Exploration is never done.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:16.342
(Dave) You know, when you look around and you see the faces

01:20:16.437 --> 01:20:18.803
of the guys
who are just so proud

01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:22.389
they've been part of this one man's dream and this adventure,

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:24.190
it's pretty unique.

01:20:24.278 --> 01:20:25.814
You know, he's driven us hard,

01:20:25.904 --> 01:20:28.816
but we care about him
immensely.

01:20:33.746 --> 01:20:37.034
14, standby for recovery
on the starboard side.

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:01.770
[cheering]

01:21:07.488 --> 01:21:09.854
Deepsea Challenger,
Deepsea Challenger, S. O.

01:21:12.993 --> 01:21:15.325
(James) S. O. Deepsea Challenger. Go ahead.

01:21:15.412 --> 01:21:17.198
Good to have you back, Jim.

01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:19.371
Copy that.
Good to be back.

01:21:19.458 --> 01:21:22.495
(John) Deepsea Challenger, we’re coming to get you.

01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:26.249
You guys are my heroes
in real life.

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:29.707
(Dave) Tighten the taglines. Tighten the taglines.

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:37.631
Stop there.
Stop there.

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:40.809
(James) This sub is notjust a machine.

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:44.889
It's the hopes
and dreams and will

01:21:44.942 --> 01:21:47.649
of all the members
of the team made manifest.

01:21:49.279 --> 01:21:52.146
They are the soul
of the machine

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:54.482
and it is them.

01:22:11.009 --> 01:22:13.250
Only the people that
are on this expedition

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:16.587
will ever understand what it took to accomplish the goal

01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:19.389
and that will bond us together
for the rest of our lives.

01:22:23.522 --> 01:22:25.012
[cheering]

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:35.314
We did it, man.
We did it.

01:22:39.037 --> 01:22:40.197
We did it.

01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:41.904
We all did it.

01:22:41.999 --> 01:22:43.785
I was just
the unlucky son of a bitch

01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:46.288
that had to get crammed in here
to go take the ride.

01:22:54.344 --> 01:22:55.459
Hey, baby.
Hi.

01:22:58.599 --> 01:22:59.759
[man]
Steady, man.

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:01.048
That's a good kiss.

01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:05.344
Did you see
my shot?

01:23:05.439 --> 01:23:07.225
Did you find my shot piles down there?

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:16.939
I think every explorer
has the same thing inside.

01:23:19.536 --> 01:23:21.743
They know that
the risk is worth it

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:26.164
because the y're widening
the pool of knowledge.

01:23:26.251 --> 01:23:30.039
It's important for us as a species to not lose that drive,

01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:33.213
whether it's in the oceans,
whether it's out in space,

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:37.760
going to Mars, going to the outer planets, to the icy moons.

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:41.509
Whatever it is, we need to keep that part of us alive.
