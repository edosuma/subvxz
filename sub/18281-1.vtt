00:14.333 --> 00:15.499
-When I walk up,

00:15.500 --> 00:16.417
there's this big, fat,

00:16.418 --> 00:17.332
bald muscular guy.

00:17.333 --> 00:19.042
- I walk in, and he goes,
- "What do you want?"

00:19.045 --> 00:20.625
- I said, "I want to make
- An appointment to get a tattoo."

00:20.628 --> 00:21.917
- He says, "What do you want
- A tattoo of?"

00:21.920 --> 00:23.249
And I said, "This,"

00:23.250 --> 00:25.375
- and he goes, "What is that?
- A puppy? A kitten?"

00:25.378 --> 00:27.667
- And, like, one guy in the back
- Goes, "It's a pony,"

00:27.670 --> 00:29.333
- and I said, "I want that guy
- To do my tattoo."

I happen to be

the fastest Pegasus in the sky!

The fastest Pegasus in the sky!

It's because I'm awesome.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.583
Ba-ha-ha-ha!

02:16.000 --> 02:17.625
- [As herself]
- I've been doing voice work

02:17.628 --> 02:19.792
For about six years now,

02:19.793 --> 02:21.957
I guess.

02:21.958 --> 02:23.375
I graduated from the Canadian

02:23.376 --> 02:24.791
College of Performing Arts,

02:24.792 --> 02:26.334
and basically got picked up

02:26.335 --> 02:27.874
by an agent

02:27.875 --> 02:29.499
at this showcase that we did,

02:29.500 --> 02:31.082
and told me

02:31.083 --> 02:32.958
that he thought I would be good

02:32.959 --> 02:34.832
at voice-over work,

02:34.833 --> 02:36.458
so I went in

02:36.459 --> 02:38.082
and did a reading with him.

02:38.083 --> 02:40.250
- He was confident that my voice
- Capabilities were there,

02:40.253 --> 02:41.771
So he started just sending me

02:41.772 --> 02:43.291
out to these auditions,

02:43.292 --> 02:44.667
and it was pretty nerve-wracking

02:44.668 --> 02:46.041
at first.

02:46.042 --> 02:47.124
I went into a room

02:47.125 --> 02:48.458
- where all these people
- Knew each other,

02:48.461 --> 02:50.416
And I was this outsider.

02:50.417 --> 02:51.834
I didn't really know

02:51.835 --> 02:53.249
how to, you know,

02:53.250 --> 02:54.707
manoeuvre around the microphone.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.042
- I mean,
- I'd had singing experience,

02:56.045 --> 02:57.707
So that was good,

02:57.708 --> 02:59.063
but yeah, I just kind of

02:59.064 --> 03:00.416
got thrown into it,

03:00.417 --> 03:02.563
and the first voice-over role

03:02.564 --> 03:04.707
was...

03:04.708 --> 03:05.958
a character

03:05.959 --> 03:07.207
called Slim Pig.

03:07.208 --> 03:08.521
And he's just this paper-thin

03:08.522 --> 03:09.832
pig that would, like,

03:09.833 --> 03:11.250
go around the barn

03:11.251 --> 03:12.666
and get into adventures.

03:12.667 --> 03:13.999
He was, like, a cut-out pig,

03:14.000 --> 03:15.313
but all the other animals

03:15.314 --> 03:16.624
were regular... 3D.

03:16.625 --> 03:18.999
I don't know, it was strange.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.979
I kind of got hired to do

03:20.980 --> 03:22.957
this little boy voice.

03:22.958 --> 03:25.167
- [High pitched] So Slim Pig
- Kind of just sounded like this,

03:25.170 --> 03:26.374
"Hey, Little Chicken,

03:26.375 --> 03:27.896
do you want to go

03:27.897 --> 03:29.416
on an adventure today?"

03:29.417 --> 03:30.646
And he was just, like,

03:30.647 --> 03:31.874
this little dude.

03:31.875 --> 03:33.417
- Because I was
- A role already on the show,

03:33.420 --> 03:35.166
I got to play Little Chick.

03:35.167 --> 03:36.792
- [Very squeaky] This kind of
- Sounded like this...

03:36.795 --> 03:39.916
"Adventure! Oh! Adventure!"

03:39.917 --> 03:41.374
I got to play the cow.

03:41.375 --> 03:42.459
She kind of had this,

03:42.460 --> 03:43.541
like, weird voice.

03:43.542 --> 03:44.521
"Oh!"

03:44.522 --> 03:45.499
[Laughs]

03:45.500 --> 03:47.042

-♪ Coconut Fred ♪

03:55.333 --> 03:57.416
♪ Fruit Salad Island! ♪

03:57.417 --> 03:58.709
-One of my favourite roles,

03:58.710 --> 03:59.999
actually, that I ever got

04:00.000 --> 04:02.582
was this Warner Brothers cartoon

04:02.583 --> 04:04.083
called Coconut Fred's

04:04.084 --> 04:05.582
Fruit Salad Island,

04:05.583 --> 04:07.250
and it was

04:07.251 --> 04:08.916
the sexually confused tomato.

04:08.917 --> 04:10.188
He didn't know if he was

04:10.189 --> 04:11.457
a fruit or a vegetable,

04:11.458 --> 04:13.167
so he was very sensitive,

04:13.168 --> 04:14.875
and he performed poetry a lot.

04:16.708 --> 04:18.603
[Childish voice] "What am I?

04:18.605 --> 04:20.499
A fruit or a veggie?

04:20.500 --> 04:22.563
Either one

04:22.564 --> 04:24.624
could give me a wedgie."

04:24.625 --> 04:25.959
I went into the audition

04:25.960 --> 04:27.291
for the new Care Bears series,

04:27.292 --> 04:28.667
- and they were looking
- For this new Care Bear

04:28.670 --> 04:30.249
Called Oopsy Bear,

04:30.250 --> 04:31.999
who was this little boy.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.542
I guess they got

04:33.543 --> 04:35.082
a bunch of men to read for him,

04:35.083 --> 04:36.499
and that wasn't working out,

04:36.500 --> 04:38.291
so they got me in there,

04:38.292 --> 04:39.813
and I just kind of based him

04:39.814 --> 04:41.332
on Chris Farley,

04:41.333 --> 04:42.646
like, you know, that kind of,

04:42.647 --> 04:43.957
like, clumsy guy he plays

04:43.958 --> 04:44.832
all the time?

04:44.833 --> 04:46.499
He'll, like, fall...

04:46.500 --> 04:47.709
[Childish voice]

04:47.710 --> 04:48.916
"Aw, I'm re-really sorry.

04:48.917 --> 04:50.584
I didn't mean to mess up

04:50.585 --> 04:52.249
the thunderbolt coaster.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.499
Sorry."

04:53.500 --> 04:54.916
I got to play...

04:54.917 --> 04:56.583
- [Nasal, excitable voice]
- Boris Bootie.

04:56.586 --> 04:58.000
He was on this show

04:58.001 --> 04:59.416
called Ricky Sprocket.

04:59.417 --> 05:00.624
It was about a show biz kid,

05:00.625 --> 05:01.750
and Boris Bootie

05:01.751 --> 05:02.874
was just an ordinary guy

05:02.875 --> 05:03.875
who really liked

05:03.876 --> 05:04.874
breakfast cereal.

05:04.875 --> 05:06.833
- And then, so I think
- I got kind of pigeon-holed

05:06.836 --> 05:08.541
To play little boys all the time

05:08.542 --> 05:10.083
- 'cause that was, like,
- My go-to voice,

05:10.084 --> 05:11.084
Was the little boy voice.

05:13.292 --> 05:14.730
So when I went into audition

05:14.731 --> 05:16.166
for My Little Pony,

05:16.167 --> 05:17.292
I thought it was obvious

05:17.293 --> 05:18.416
that I would read for Spike,

05:18.417 --> 05:20.041
the baby dragon.

05:20.042 --> 05:21.750
- And I was just like,
- "Oh, I'll just go to, you know,

05:21.753 --> 05:23.374
Do my go-to little boy voice."

05:23.375 --> 05:24.438

05:26.835 --> 05:28.166
I love eating diamonds.

05:28.167 --> 05:29.480
You know,

05:29.481 --> 05:30.791
he's just like this little guy.

05:30.792 --> 05:31.874
I didn't...

05:31.875 --> 05:33.500
- I didn't end up getting cast
- As Spike,

05:33.503 --> 05:35.042
But I got a call-back

05:35.043 --> 05:36.582
for... not Spike,

05:36.583 --> 05:37.833
but for Applejack

05:37.834 --> 05:39.082
and Rainbow Dash.

05:39.083 --> 05:39.938
I just ended up

05:39.939 --> 05:40.791
getting both roles,

05:40.792 --> 05:43.583
which is pretty crazy.

05:46.458 --> 05:47.417
My job is fun.

[Laughs]

05:48.375 --> 05:49.499
It's cool.

05:49.500 --> 05:52.416

05:54.045 --> 05:57.249

my first Brony encounter.

Do you have any voices for us?

of 18 to 30, let's say.

06:45.083 --> 06:46.125
The pervert alarm for sure

06:46.126 --> 06:47.166
went off in my head

06:47.167 --> 06:48.625
when I first heard about it.

06:53.625 --> 06:54.813
-I want to very specifically

not give a shout out

06:59.918 --> 07:01.291
the middle of the normal scale.

-Since the reboot of the classic

07:02.668 --> 07:04.041
'80s cartoon debuted last fall,

07:04.042 --> 07:05.417

07:10.168 --> 07:11.582
isn't who you might expect.

07:11.583 --> 07:12.500
-Fanboys have taken

07:12.501 --> 07:13.416
to creating pony art,

07:13.417 --> 07:15.041
posting fan videos on YouTube,

07:15.042 --> 07:17.125
- and creating
- Blogs dedicated to the show.

- -Weird fit demographically,
- But they work together.

07:19.170 --> 07:20.707
My point is this!

07:20.708 --> 07:22.063
-Bronies have changed

07:22.064 --> 07:23.416
the definition of masculinity.

07:23.417 --> 07:24.271
-I think

07:24.272 --> 07:25.124
it's the end of...

07:25.125 --> 07:26.707
-Civilization?

07:26.708 --> 07:27.999
-What's happened

07:28.000 --> 07:29.021
is that with the spread

07:29.022 --> 07:30.041
of fast access Internet,

07:30.042 --> 07:32.208
- almost the entirety of the media
- With the fandom

07:32.211 --> 07:33.624

07:33.625 --> 07:34.771
It's, in a lot of senses,

a brand new type of fandom.

- -It's kind of inexplicable,
- Really.

07:40.878 --> 07:43.082
-What happens when a movement

07:43.083 --> 07:44.646
puts a lot of new ideas

07:44.647 --> 07:46.207
into circulation?

07:46.208 --> 07:47.542
-It, uh,

07:47.543 --> 07:48.874
doesn't really make sense.

07:48.875 --> 07:50.375
- -People are inspired
- By the environment

07:50.378 --> 07:51.749
That surrounds them.

-The Internet

07:53.189 --> 07:54.624
is a complicated idea,

- That has changed everything.

to retreat to a world

I'm known as DustyKatt

10:48.376 --> 10:49.541

you can too.

11:02.708 --> 11:04.667
- Every character
- Doesn't have the answers, right?

11:04.670 --> 11:05.792
- They have to go find
- The answers,

11:05.795 --> 11:06.646
They have to learn

11:06.647 --> 11:07.499
from their mistakes,

11:07.500 --> 11:09.333
- and that's what draws me
- To My Little Pony,

11:09.336 --> 11:10.938
Because you have

11:10.939 --> 11:12.541
character-driven story

11:12.542 --> 11:14.250
where the characters

11:14.251 --> 11:15.957
learn something and grow.

11:15.958 --> 11:17.146
There's six main characters

11:17.147 --> 11:18.332
in the show.

11:18.333 --> 11:19.666
Twilight Sparkle.

11:19.667 --> 11:20.480
Her characterization

11:20.481 --> 11:21.291
is fairly easy.

11:21.292 --> 11:22.563
Twilight

11:22.564 --> 11:23.832
is the intellectual shut-in.

11:23.833 --> 11:25.563
Now you have Applejack,

11:25.564 --> 11:27.291
who is the hard worker,

11:27.292 --> 11:29.624
that pony you can go to,

11:29.625 --> 11:31.604
but her problem is

11:31.605 --> 11:33.582
she can't let others help her.

11:33.583 --> 11:34.833
Fluttershy,

11:34.834 --> 11:36.082
too shy for her own good.

11:36.083 --> 11:37.917
That's one of her fallacies

11:37.918 --> 11:39.749
that makes her a character.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.124
Rainbow Dash...

11:41.125 --> 11:42.832
my, what an ego!

11:42.833 --> 11:44.333
- She'll never get
- Into the Wonderbolts,

11:44.336 --> 11:45.875
Because the Wonderbolts

11:45.876 --> 11:47.416
are a team situation.

11:47.417 --> 11:49.499
There's no "I" in "team."

11:49.500 --> 11:51.291
Rarity...

11:51.292 --> 11:52.771
Element of generosity...

11:52.772 --> 11:54.249
to a fault.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.292
- She has to get over that.
- She has to learn from that.

11:56.295 --> 11:58.167
And then we get to Pinkie Pie,

11:58.168 --> 12:00.041
party animal extraordinaire.

12:00.042 --> 12:01.313
Off into left field

12:01.314 --> 12:02.582
all the time,

12:02.583 --> 12:04.625
but still, when somebody

12:04.626 --> 12:06.666
needs to be picked up,

12:06.667 --> 12:07.957
when someone is feeling sad,

12:07.958 --> 12:11.416
she's there every time.

12:11.417 --> 12:13.313
Each individual character

12:13.314 --> 12:15.207
is so well rounded

12:15.208 --> 12:17.083
within an archetype

12:17.084 --> 12:18.957
of personality,

12:18.958 --> 12:20.646
so people can see themselves

12:20.647 --> 12:22.332
as a Rainbow Dash,

12:22.333 --> 12:24.021
a Rarity,

12:24.022 --> 12:25.707
or an Applejack.

12:25.708 --> 12:27.438
That is the basis

12:27.439 --> 12:29.167
of excellent storytelling.

12:33.792 --> 12:36.542
Don't think of it as

12:36.543 --> 12:39.292
six little ponies in Ponyville.

12:44.792 --> 12:47.625
Think of it as six friends

12:47.626 --> 12:50.457
learning from each other.

12:50.458 --> 12:52.167
It just happens to be wrapped up

12:52.168 --> 12:53.874
in a package of pastel ponies

12:53.875 --> 12:55.416
that's animated well.

12:55.417 --> 12:57.332
This is a show for kids,

12:57.333 --> 12:59.208
but it doesn't wallow

12:59.209 --> 13:01.082
in that point.

13:01.083 --> 13:02.167
I'm just a guy who happens

13:02.168 --> 13:03.249

13:04.625 --> 13:06.021
I love what it does,

13:06.022 --> 13:07.416
I love the message it sends,

13:07.417 --> 13:08.791
and I want to be a part of it,

13:08.792 --> 13:10.230

13:10.231 --> 13:11.666
to play in that universe.

13:11.667 --> 13:14.166
We're suppose to chug beer,

13:14.167 --> 13:16.499
ride motorcycles,

13:16.500 --> 13:18.582
be degrading to women,

13:18.583 --> 13:21.166

13:21.167 --> 13:22.896
That's what's engrained

13:22.897 --> 13:24.624

from the minute you're born

13:27.189 --> 13:29.749

13:29.750 --> 13:32.082
Well, I like what I like.

13:32.083 --> 13:34.375
I don't need society

13:34.376 --> 13:36.666

immediately!"

14:12.583 --> 14:14.832
About a year ago,

14:14.833 --> 14:16.479
the Brony Phenomenon

14:16.480 --> 14:18.124
sort of fell into our laps,

14:18.125 --> 14:20.874
and as soon as I heard about it,

14:20.875 --> 14:22.479
I thought,

14:22.480 --> 14:24.082
"Somebody needs to study this."

14:24.083 --> 14:26.083
"Fandom" is a term that's used

14:26.084 --> 14:28.082
for the community,

14:28.083 --> 14:30.208
and in general,

14:30.209 --> 14:32.332
people usually look at fandoms

14:32.333 --> 14:34.208
- with kind of a little bit
- Of a, like,

14:34.211 --> 14:35.125
"These people

14:35.126 --> 14:36.041
need to get a life."

14:36.042 --> 14:37.082
Well, in fact, actually,

14:37.083 --> 14:38.792
- where does the term "fan"
- Come from?

14:38.795 --> 14:40.416
"Fanatic."

14:40.417 --> 14:42.771
-You know it could be,

14:42.772 --> 14:45.124
um, the Carolina Panthers.

14:45.125 --> 14:49.332
It could be, um, Star Trek.

14:49.333 --> 14:50.479
Uh, it could be

14:50.480 --> 14:51.624
My Little Pony...

14:51.625 --> 14:52.479
-Oprah.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.332
-It could be Oprah.

14:53.333 --> 14:56.207
It could be anything.

14:56.208 --> 14:58.271
-Our Bronies

14:58.272 --> 15:00.332
ranged from 14 to 57,

15:00.333 --> 15:02.042
with the average age

15:02.043 --> 15:03.749
was around 21 years of age.

15:03.750 --> 15:05.292
- Then there's
- The question of gender.

15:05.295 --> 15:07.750
We usually ran around

15:07.751 --> 15:10.207
85% male and 15% female.

15:10.208 --> 15:11.479
Some female Bronies

15:11.480 --> 15:12.749
like to be called Bronies,

15:12.750 --> 15:13.917
some like to be called

15:13.918 --> 15:15.082
Pegasisters.

15:15.083 --> 15:16.604
-And we question

15:16.605 --> 15:18.124
if that 15% female,

15:18.125 --> 15:20.166
how much of those are Bronies

15:20.167 --> 15:21.042
because they have

15:21.043 --> 15:21.916
a Brony boyfriend.

15:21.917 --> 15:23.582
-Hmm-hmm. Yep.

15:23.583 --> 15:25.104
Bronies score lower

15:25.105 --> 15:26.624
in neuroticism.

15:26.625 --> 15:28.209
Neuroticism is sort of like

15:28.210 --> 15:29.791
a tendency...

15:29.792 --> 15:30.709
and I've sort of wrote

15:30.710 --> 15:31.624
it's a tendency

15:31.625 --> 15:33.479
to experience negative emotions

15:33.480 --> 15:35.332
like anger, anxiety,

15:35.333 --> 15:37.499
to worry, to be stressed,

15:37.500 --> 15:38.834
and the Bronies

15:38.835 --> 15:40.166
have lower scores,

15:40.167 --> 15:41.250
so again, that would tend

15:41.251 --> 15:42.332
to say this is a group...

15:42.333 --> 15:44.000
- now, there are going to be
- Depressed Bronies,

15:44.003 --> 15:45.500
- and there are gonna be
- Anxious Bronies,

15:45.503 --> 15:48.041
But that's very positive.

15:48.042 --> 15:49.291
Education level...

15:49.292 --> 15:50.771
What we found was around 35%

15:50.772 --> 15:52.249
of our Bronies

15:52.250 --> 15:53.832
were in high school,

15:56.001 --> 15:58.166
or had completed college.

15:58.167 --> 15:59.791
And then one of the biggies,

15:59.792 --> 16:01.292
the sexual orientation question,

16:01.293 --> 16:02.791
which...

16:02.792 --> 16:04.500
many people when they first

16:04.501 --> 16:06.207
hear about the Bronies

16:06.208 --> 16:07.582
will say things like,

16:07.583 --> 16:08.875
"Well, is it a bunch of gays

16:08.876 --> 16:10.166
and that?"

16:10.167 --> 16:12.438
84% of the Bronies will describe

16:12.439 --> 16:14.707
themselves as heterosexuals.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.875
One and a half percent

16:16.876 --> 16:19.041
label themselves as homosexuals,

16:19.042 --> 16:21.792
and about 10% bisexual,

16:21.793 --> 16:24.541
and then around 3-4% asexual.

16:24.542 --> 16:26.855
-Asexual is,

16:26.856 --> 16:29.166

16:31.522 --> 16:33.875

16:38.086 --> 16:40.313
-It's still a puzzle.

16:40.314 --> 16:42.541
It's a puzzle to us as well,

16:42.542 --> 16:45.688
but, um, I think that it's...

16:45.689 --> 16:48.832
that the, um,

16:48.833 --> 16:50.896
that society as a whole

16:50.897 --> 16:52.957
is becoming less negative

- I got to the end
- Of the second episode.

17:39.670 --> 17:41.083
- I'm like,
- "Yeah, that's pretty decent.

17:41.086 --> 17:43.082
It's okay. It's not bad.

17:43.083 --> 17:44.375
- You know, I better watch
- The third episode

17:44.378 --> 17:45.271
To make sure

17:45.272 --> 17:46.166
that it's, you know,

17:46.167 --> 17:47.583
- maintaining
- That level of quality,"

17:47.586 --> 17:48.438
And then the fourth

17:48.439 --> 17:49.291
and the fifth,

17:49.292 --> 17:51.167
- and by the time
- I got to the 17th episode,

17:51.170 --> 17:52.667
- I kind of hung my head
- In resignation.

17:52.670 --> 17:53.730
It's kinda like, "Damnit."

17:53.731 --> 17:54.791
You know?

17:54.792 --> 17:56.541
"I guess I'm a Brony.

17:56.542 --> 17:57.792
Oh well, better come

17:57.793 --> 17:59.041
to terms with it."

17:59.042 --> 18:00.105
4chan is an image

18:00.106 --> 18:01.166
and message board

18:01.167 --> 18:03.082
where the Brony movement began,

18:03.083 --> 18:04.749
basically, back in...

18:04.750 --> 18:09.041
I think it was October of 2010.

18:09.042 --> 18:10.791
Somebody wrote an article.

18:10.792 --> 18:12.146
They were citing My Little Pony:

18:12.147 --> 18:13.499
Friendship Is Magic

18:13.500 --> 18:15.542
as showing that companies

18:15.543 --> 18:17.582
were micromanaging programs.

18:17.583 --> 18:19.021
Well, new cartoon shows

18:19.022 --> 18:20.457
are all about merchandising,

18:20.458 --> 18:22.000
so somebody on 4chan went

18:22.001 --> 18:23.541
and decided to watch it

18:23.542 --> 18:25.333
- and said,
- "Hey, it's pretty good,"

18:25.336 --> 18:26.125
And so they made

18:26.126 --> 18:26.916
a post about it.

18:26.917 --> 18:28.458
- Other people
- Started watching it,

18:28.461 --> 18:29.875
- and they're like, "Hey, yeah,
- It's actually pretty good."

18:29.878 --> 18:31.792
- And it became this kind of,
- Like, weird phenomenon.

18:31.795 --> 18:33.084
They ended up becoming kind of

18:33.085 --> 18:34.374
like their own little clan.

18:34.375 --> 18:35.896
So more people watched the show

18:35.897 --> 18:37.416
to try and figure out,

18:37.417 --> 18:39.499
"Okay, is this just a big joke?"

18:39.500 --> 18:41.042
- And then they started posting
- Images on the boards,

18:41.045 --> 18:43.125
- and then the moderators of 4chan
- Decided,

18:43.128 --> 18:44.875
- "No, we don't want all
- These pony images everywhere,"

18:44.878 --> 18:46.207
So they shut it down,

18:46.208 --> 18:47.667
- so then
- They start another one.

18:47.670 --> 18:48.896
It became this whole, like,

18:48.897 --> 18:50.124
flurry of online activity.

18:50.125 --> 18:51.792
In a sense, 4chan was the start

18:51.793 --> 18:53.457
of the Brony community.

18:53.458 --> 18:55.313
It's the deep depths

18:55.314 --> 18:57.166
of shameless Internet.

18:57.167 --> 18:58.917
- Actually, people like to think,
- Okay, Bronies,

18:58.920 --> 19:00.625
The name "Bronies" came from

19:00.626 --> 19:02.332
"bros" and "ponies."

19:02.333 --> 19:03.749
That's not where it came from.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.396
It came from the "/b/"

19:05.397 --> 19:07.041
message boards, and "ponies."

19:07.042 --> 19:08.291
So that's how they combined it.

19:08.292 --> 19:10.188
It was 4chan "/b/" and "ponies,"

19:10.189 --> 19:12.082
so Bronies,

19:12.083 --> 19:13.375
but I kind of like

19:13.376 --> 19:14.666
the "bro" one better

19:14.667 --> 19:16.417
because it feels a little more,

19:16.418 --> 19:18.166
you know, "Hey, bro!"

19:18.167 --> 19:20.292
So that's just me.

25:55.170 --> 25:56.457
Talk about Rarity...

25:56.458 --> 25:57.292
oh, they would love

25:57.293 --> 25:58.124
to meet Rarity.

25:58.125 --> 25:59.291
-The role in the community

25:59.292 --> 26:00.542
- is they are
- The biggest celebrities.

26:00.545 --> 26:01.605
They are the biggest draw

26:01.606 --> 26:02.666
to these conventions

26:02.667 --> 26:03.980
because people want to have

26:03.981 --> 26:05.291
that kind of, like, one on one

26:05.292 --> 26:06.625
with the closest thing there is

26:06.626 --> 26:07.957
to the characters.

26:07.958 --> 26:09.313
-I think we have near on

26:09.314 --> 26:10.666
a thousand preregistered,

26:10.667 --> 26:12.459

26:12.460 --> 26:14.249
to let people pay at the door.

26:14.250 --> 26:16.000
- We're looking at basically
- Hitting fire code limits

26:16.003 --> 26:18.457
For the convention.

26:18.458 --> 26:22.291

26:22.292 --> 26:24.625
- -Military Bronies are
- Just people who enjoy the show

26:24.628 --> 26:25.749
And are in the military,

26:25.750 --> 26:26.957
and it can be from the extent

26:26.958 --> 26:29.250
- of somebody
- Who watches the show regularly

26:29.253 --> 26:31.042
- and maybe has a few pieces
- Of art,

26:31.045 --> 26:32.542
And other people

26:32.543 --> 26:34.041
who liked the whole thing.

26:34.042 --> 26:35.874
-That's a Mark 46 machine gun.

26:35.875 --> 26:37.771
It's a semi auto version,

26:37.772 --> 26:39.666
but shoots 223 ammo.

26:39.667 --> 26:40.625
- My friends were making fun
- Of me

26:40.628 --> 26:42.207
For being a Brony for years,

26:42.208 --> 26:43.188
and so I told them

26:43.189 --> 26:44.166
what could be more manly

26:44.167 --> 26:45.416
than going around

26:45.417 --> 26:46.708
- with all the friends
- With the machine guns

26:46.711 --> 26:48.583
- and all the tactical gear
- And everything else

26:48.586 --> 26:49.999
Than go out with Brony gear?

26:50.000 --> 26:51.291
-The definition of a man

26:51.292 --> 26:52.646
is a human male

26:52.647 --> 26:53.999

26:54.000 --> 26:54.999
That's it.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.313
It's as simple

26:56.314 --> 26:57.625
as it really gets.

27:02.042 --> 27:03.957
-My name is Bryan Mischke.

27:03.958 --> 27:05.083
I'm predominantly an artist

27:05.084 --> 27:06.207
by hobby,

27:06.208 --> 27:07.583
- and everything like that
- Has been

27:07.586 --> 27:09.000
Pretty much

27:09.001 --> 27:10.416
my one and only real passion.

27:10.417 --> 27:12.624
I have a long time history,

27:12.625 --> 27:13.729
six years of service

27:13.730 --> 27:14.832
in the National Guard,

27:14.833 --> 27:16.207
the Army National Guard,

27:16.208 --> 27:18.958
so I think that pretty much

27:18.959 --> 27:21.707
is the gist of who I am.

27:21.708 --> 27:22.896
When I was 16,

27:22.897 --> 27:24.082
I was in school still.

27:24.083 --> 27:25.354
I dropped out

27:25.355 --> 27:26.624
at about 16 and a half.

27:26.625 --> 27:28.146
17, on my birthday,

27:28.147 --> 27:29.666
I joined the military.

27:29.667 --> 27:31.105
I swore in that day

27:31.106 --> 27:32.541
my recruiter got me,

27:32.542 --> 27:36.125
and at 18, I was in Iraq.

27:50.708 --> 27:52.521
Best allegory I can

27:52.522 --> 27:54.332
possibly use to describe Iraq,

27:54.333 --> 27:55.979
um, came recently

27:55.980 --> 27:57.624
when I saw the movie Tron,

27:57.625 --> 27:59.582
and it's very interesting,

27:59.583 --> 28:01.875
- because basically, when
- You go out to the world of Tron,

28:01.878 --> 28:03.209
Everything is really barren,

28:03.210 --> 28:04.541
everything is really organized.

28:04.542 --> 28:06.250
It just kind of... it feels

28:06.251 --> 28:07.957
real, but it's not real,

28:07.958 --> 28:10.499
and devoid of real, like, life.

28:10.500 --> 28:11.832
It's just feels like that.

28:11.833 --> 28:13.750
- Everything is devoid of life.
- That's the desert.

28:13.753 --> 28:15.250
It was desert for me

28:15.251 --> 28:16.750
when I was down there.

28:23.917 --> 28:25.292
Every tough experience

28:25.293 --> 28:26.666
is only gratifying

28:26.667 --> 28:29.125
after the experience.

28:33.958 --> 28:35.207
I guess I would say

28:35.208 --> 28:36.708
is that the last five months

28:36.709 --> 28:38.207
in Iraq

28:38.208 --> 28:39.813
was probably one of the hardest

28:39.814 --> 28:41.416
experiences I had,

28:41.417 --> 28:44.707
if not the hardest.

28:44.708 --> 28:46.083
- Actually, you know,
- To be honest,

28:46.086 --> 28:47.604
The hardest

28:47.605 --> 28:49.124
actually came after that.

28:49.125 --> 28:50.667
- I went through probably
- A really good year and a half

28:50.670 --> 28:52.874
Of a pretty deep depression

28:52.875 --> 28:55.124
after I got back from Iraq.

28:55.125 --> 28:56.563
For some reason, I don't know

28:56.564 --> 28:57.999
why I felt this way,

28:58.000 --> 28:58.813
and I still can't

28:58.814 --> 28:59.624
put a finger on it,

28:59.625 --> 29:01.250
but I felt a tremendous amount

29:01.251 --> 29:02.874
of shame after a while,

29:02.875 --> 29:04.416
just for everything,

29:04.417 --> 29:06.624
even for the military, maybe.

29:06.625 --> 29:08.749
I don't cry, I don't,

29:08.750 --> 29:09.792
and I just remember

29:09.793 --> 29:10.832
this one time,

29:10.833 --> 29:12.542
I just went for a walk,

29:12.543 --> 29:14.249
and so many things are going on,

29:14.250 --> 29:15.146
and I just broke down

29:15.147 --> 29:16.041
and called my mom,

29:16.042 --> 29:17.583
- and I cried
- For, like, three minutes,

29:17.586 --> 29:19.042
- and it's kind of getting me
- A little emotional right now,

29:19.045 --> 29:20.750
But, like,

29:20.751 --> 29:22.457
I just let it all out.

29:22.458 --> 29:24.250
- I talked about everything
- That was affecting me,

29:24.253 --> 29:26.021
And I don't really talk

29:26.022 --> 29:27.792
about those things.

29:29.458 --> 29:31.625
- Life was just so much simpler
- When you were out in the desert.

29:31.628 --> 29:33.083
- Everything was planned out
- For you and everything.

29:33.086 --> 29:33.792
Now you're back

29:33.793 --> 29:34.499
in the real world

29:34.500 --> 29:37.582
trying to figure it out.

29:37.583 --> 29:39.042
Art stopped doing for me

29:39.043 --> 29:40.499
what it used to do for me.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.833
- I just kind of stopped drawing
- Altogether.

29:42.836 --> 29:44.917
- I didn't really see the point.
- It didn't really make me money.

29:44.920 --> 29:46.250
- It didn't really
- Make me feel happy.

29:46.253 --> 29:47.792
- I didn't really feel
- Like I had a purpose anymore

29:47.795 --> 29:50.207
In that area.

29:50.208 --> 29:52.124
And then I discovered ponies.

29:52.125 --> 29:53.625
- I discovered a reason
- To draw again,

29:53.628 --> 29:54.563
Now here I am,

29:54.564 --> 29:55.499
making art again, so...

29:55.500 --> 29:57.709
don't underestimate

29:57.710 --> 29:59.916
the things that make you happy.

29:59.917 --> 30:01.334
You know, if drawing ponies

30:01.335 --> 30:02.749
makes you happy,

30:02.750 --> 30:04.042
there is no reason to feel bad

30:04.043 --> 30:05.333
about that.

30:08.292 --> 30:09.624
Yeah, I've been drawing this,

30:09.625 --> 30:11.458
- or I guess
- I say I drew this drawing.

30:11.461 --> 30:14.082
It's a pretty detailed drawing.

30:14.083 --> 30:15.417
This drawing took me

30:15.418 --> 30:16.749
probably about a week.

30:16.750 --> 30:17.750
It's the first drawing

30:17.751 --> 30:18.749
I've drawn

30:18.750 --> 30:20.957
in a very, very long time.

30:20.958 --> 30:23.104
It was kind of the catalyst

30:23.105 --> 30:25.249
to me getting back into artwork

30:25.250 --> 30:27.042
after probably about a year,

30:27.043 --> 30:28.832
year and a half hiatus.

- Of the show.

on that show,

30:44.250 --> 30:45.313

30:45.314 --> 30:46.374

In my opinion.

31:13.420 --> 31:15.583
- this drawing
- That I made of her character.

- I think it's really important
- That I give it to her,

31:17.170 --> 31:18.542
- because I really want her
- To know

31:18.545 --> 31:20.084
That she's able

31:20.085 --> 31:21.624
to change lives.

are interested in seeing.

More or less,

32:05.376 --> 32:06.957
it turns into a fan hub,

is post things

32:10.542 --> 32:11.999

When we were first starting,

a thousand page views,

"Oh, my gosh, amazing."

I mean, that took, like,

32:59.064 --> 33:00.082
months to hit.

33:00.083 --> 33:02.479
And then we started climbing up,

33:02.480 --> 33:04.874
getting 100,000, 200,000...

33:04.875 --> 33:06.146
skipped over 300,000,

41:29.125 --> 41:30.229
I forced him to watch

41:30.230 --> 41:31.332
one episode,

41:31.333 --> 41:33.083
- and he's just in love with it
- Instantly.

41:33.086 --> 41:35.208
[Laughing]

41:40.000 --> 41:41.084
-The grade school I went to

41:41.085 --> 41:42.166
was tiny.

41:42.167 --> 41:43.188
There were 32 kids

41:43.189 --> 41:44.207
in my graduating class,

41:44.208 --> 41:45.667
which made it almost impossible

41:45.668 --> 41:47.124
to fit in

41:47.125 --> 41:48.832
if you weren't the mould

41:48.833 --> 41:50.667
that everyone wanted you

41:50.668 --> 41:52.499
to conform to,

41:52.500 --> 41:54.167
and I wasn't.

41:55.917 --> 41:56.938
-Like, last year,

41:56.939 --> 41:57.957
at the end of,

41:57.958 --> 42:00.374
towards the end of the year,

42:00.375 --> 42:02.104
we had really started

42:02.105 --> 42:03.832
getting together

42:03.833 --> 42:06.250
as a group of friends

42:06.251 --> 42:08.666
who are all into the show,

42:08.667 --> 42:10.125
and we decided that we wanted

42:10.126 --> 42:11.582
to start a club.

42:11.583 --> 42:13.541
-So we got our friend

42:13.542 --> 42:15.896
who is really good at drawing

42:15.897 --> 42:18.249
vectors on the computer,

42:18.250 --> 42:19.541
like this,

42:19.542 --> 42:20.313
and he designed

42:20.314 --> 42:21.082
this shirt for us.

42:21.083 --> 42:22.646
And so you have this Harmony

42:22.647 --> 42:24.207
spelled out

42:24.208 --> 42:25.479
with elements

42:25.480 --> 42:26.749
of the periodic table,

42:26.750 --> 42:29.916
and it's kind of a pun,

42:29.917 --> 42:31.125
because the strongest force

42:31.126 --> 42:32.332
in the show

42:32.333 --> 42:33.832
is the elements of Harmony,

42:33.833 --> 42:35.291
and so that's kind of a pun,

42:35.292 --> 42:36.584
and then

42:36.585 --> 42:37.874
he drew out the vector,

42:37.875 --> 42:40.042
and we all bought the shirts.

42:41.375 --> 42:43.875
[♪♪♪]

42:50.417 --> 42:51.624
-A Brony?

42:51.625 --> 42:53.332
No, I've never heard of one.

42:53.333 --> 42:54.542
-If you really like

42:54.543 --> 42:55.749
My Little Pony,

42:55.750 --> 42:57.083
- could be something for you
- There, I guess.

42:57.086 --> 43:00.791
-It's like adult comedy... no?

43:00.792 --> 43:02.875
- -There's people
- Into weirder stuff than that.

43:02.878 --> 43:04.624
-That's pretty random.

43:04.625 --> 43:05.750
-People should be grown up

43:05.751 --> 43:06.874
around now.

43:06.875 --> 43:08.958
-That's, that's pretty odd.

43:15.958 --> 43:17.854
-Which one of you guys

43:17.855 --> 43:19.749
created that adorable logo

43:19.750 --> 43:21.667
- with the Northwestern "N"
- And Twilight Sparkle?

43:21.670 --> 43:22.957
Was that you?

43:22.958 --> 43:24.374
I like the idea

43:24.375 --> 43:25.792
- that Twilight Sparkle
- Should be our official mascot,

43:25.795 --> 43:27.916
Because A, she's nerdy,

43:27.917 --> 43:28.875
and Northwestern

43:28.876 --> 43:29.832
is legendarily nerdy,

43:29.833 --> 43:31.125
and B, she's purple,

43:31.126 --> 43:32.416
and Northwestern is purple,

43:32.417 --> 43:34.208
- so I think
- That we really do have to accept

43:34.211 --> 43:35.292
That Twilight Sparkle

43:35.293 --> 43:36.374
is our mascot.

43:36.375 --> 43:37.917
-They have, like, a place where

43:37.918 --> 43:39.457
they put, like, local meet-ups

43:39.458 --> 43:41.146
for different universities

43:41.147 --> 43:42.832
across the world, even,

43:42.833 --> 43:44.167
- and I saw one for Northwestern,
- And I was, like,

43:44.170 --> 43:46.082
"Wow, there actually...

43:46.083 --> 43:46.792
There are Bronies

43:46.793 --> 43:47.499
at Northwestern.

43:47.500 --> 43:48.834
That's cool.

43:48.835 --> 43:50.166
Let's see what's up there."

43:50.167 --> 43:51.457
And I joined the group.

43:51.458 --> 43:53.646
-We usually meet, like,

43:53.647 --> 43:55.832
about every two weeks,

43:55.833 --> 43:58.416
um, catch the new episode,

43:58.417 --> 44:00.000
- maybe watch
- A few other episodes.

44:00.003 --> 44:01.749
-Brings people together,

44:01.750 --> 44:04.166
you know, makes friendships...

44:04.167 --> 44:06.791
appropriately, I suppose,

44:06.792 --> 44:08.750
and I guess it is kind of cool

44:08.751 --> 44:10.707
that a show, you know,

44:10.708 --> 44:11.833
so ostensibly

44:11.834 --> 44:12.957
about friendship

44:12.958 --> 44:14.354
is creating friendships

44:14.355 --> 44:15.749
in the real world.

44:15.750 --> 44:17.459
-A big part of any community

44:17.460 --> 44:19.166
isn't just the show,

44:19.167 --> 44:20.832
but reacting to the show

44:20.833 --> 44:22.104
and being able to share

44:22.105 --> 44:23.374
your first reactions

44:23.375 --> 44:24.999
on those episodes

44:25.000 --> 44:26.875
and whatever else

44:26.876 --> 44:28.749
you might find online, and...

44:28.750 --> 44:30.250
- but that's just really
- The beginning

44:30.253 --> 44:32.207
Of what we've been doing,

44:32.208 --> 44:34.271
and it's like parties and games

44:34.272 --> 44:36.332
and food and fun,

44:36.333 --> 44:38.416
all this stuff.

44:38.417 --> 44:39.625
-There seems to be

44:39.626 --> 44:40.832
this undercurrent

44:40.833 --> 44:42.167
- to most of the things
- That's reported

44:42.170 --> 44:43.832
Or written about us

44:43.833 --> 44:46.125
- where two-thirds of the time,
- Three-quarters of the time

44:46.128 --> 44:47.334
Has to be spent

44:47.335 --> 44:48.541
reassuring people

44:48.542 --> 44:51.124
that we're not insane,

44:51.125 --> 44:53.916
and that's somewhat...

44:53.917 --> 44:55.749
well, we may be insane,

44:55.750 --> 44:57.459
but not criminally insane,

44:57.460 --> 44:59.166
I should put it.

44:59.167 --> 45:00.499
-Northwestern is a place

45:00.500 --> 45:02.625
- where fraternities
- Are actually really important,

45:02.628 --> 45:03.916
And when I came to Northwestern,

45:03.917 --> 45:05.500
- I swore I was never going
- To join a fraternity.

45:05.503 --> 45:06.749
-The whole fraternity aspect

45:06.750 --> 45:08.542
- kind of puts the whole "bro"
- In Brony.

45:08.545 --> 45:10.708
- I mean,
- It's all about the community.

45:10.711 --> 45:11.458
-You can share it

45:11.459 --> 45:12.207
with other people,

45:12.208 --> 45:13.563
and that's, you know,

45:13.564 --> 45:14.916
the magic of being a Brony.

45:14.917 --> 45:18.375
[♪♪♪]

45:23.083 --> 45:24.667
-There should be like,

45:24.668 --> 45:26.249

45:28.083 --> 45:29.874

What am I doing?

So it'll be here

45:41.564 --> 45:42.249
in the morning.

45:42.250 --> 45:43.834
Just kidding.

45:43.835 --> 45:45.416
I'm not gonna do that.

45:45.417 --> 45:46.791
To be honest,

45:46.792 --> 45:48.875
- I don't know what the convention
- Is going to be like.

45:48.878 --> 45:51.291
Um...

45:51.292 --> 45:54.999
I kind of have an idea,

45:55.000 --> 45:56.709
but...

45:56.710 --> 45:58.416
yeah, I'm not totally sure.

45:58.417 --> 46:01.291
Like, these people could be...

46:01.292 --> 46:02.624
they could be really scary.

46:02.625 --> 46:04.750
Maybe I should be packing

46:04.751 --> 46:06.874
bear mace or something.

46:06.875 --> 46:08.124
But...

46:08.125 --> 46:09.334
I did have a stalker

46:09.335 --> 46:10.541
a little while ago.

46:10.542 --> 46:12.541
I believe it was a male.

46:12.542 --> 46:14.313
He called me

46:14.314 --> 46:16.082
with, like, a vocoder thing,

46:16.083 --> 46:17.917
- something,
- A distortion on his voice,

46:17.920 --> 46:19.105
So it sounded really low

46:19.106 --> 46:20.291
and scary,

46:20.292 --> 46:22.125
kind of like the "Scream" voice,

46:22.126 --> 46:23.957
like... uh...

46:23.958 --> 46:25.417
- "Hello, Sidney,
- Are you alone in the house,"

46:25.420 --> 46:26.480
That kind of thing,

46:26.481 --> 46:27.541
but, like, really low,

46:27.542 --> 46:29.124
and... yeah,

46:29.125 --> 46:31.063
just asked me what I was wearing

46:31.064 --> 46:32.999
and what I was doing that night,

46:33.000 --> 46:34.104
and, yeah,

46:34.105 --> 46:35.207
it was a little bit weird,

46:35.208 --> 46:36.188
just kind of

46:36.189 --> 46:37.166
invading your privacy.

46:37.167 --> 46:38.959
It's a weird feeling,

46:38.960 --> 46:40.749
but nothing came of it.

46:40.750 --> 46:42.042
- People were, like,
- "You should call the police.

46:42.043 --> 46:43.082
You should do this and that,"

46:43.083 --> 46:45.624
and I just kind of let it go.

46:45.625 --> 46:47.082
Um...

46:47.083 --> 46:48.688
Bronies were not

46:48.689 --> 46:50.291
on the radar at this time.

46:50.292 --> 46:52.521
The Bronies that I've met so far

46:52.522 --> 46:54.749
have been really nice.

46:54.750 --> 46:56.188
They're really enthusiastic

46:56.189 --> 46:57.624
about the show,

46:57.625 --> 46:59.084
and it's definitely going to be

46:59.085 --> 47:00.541
interesting to be in a room

47:00.542 --> 47:05.375
full of just, just Bronies.

- In life

47:25.795 --> 47:27.374

as long as you don't hurt

- We're just big kids,

47:32.503 --> 47:34.458
And we're happy.

47:41.292 --> 47:43.105
You know, I own my own house,

47:43.106 --> 47:44.916
but I love video games.

47:44.917 --> 47:46.230
I have Transformers,

47:46.231 --> 47:47.541
My Little Ponies...

47:47.542 --> 47:49.480
We like to do things

47:49.481 --> 47:51.416
that make us smile, you know.

47:51.417 --> 47:53.083
- I'm not really worried
- About, you know,

47:53.086 --> 47:54.249
What she'll think of us.

47:54.250 --> 47:56.042
- Like, she's being brought up
- In all this.

47:56.043 --> 47:57.125
- We just want to bring them up
- With this happy,

47:57.128 --> 47:58.374
You can like anything.

47:58.375 --> 48:00.250
- It doesn't matter
- If you're a child, an adult,

48:00.253 --> 48:01.749
A girl, a boy...

48:01.750 --> 48:03.125
if it makes you happy,

48:03.126 --> 48:04.499
there's nothing wrong with that,

48:04.500 --> 48:05.624
you know, you just do it.

48:05.625 --> 48:06.521
And if that makes

48:06.522 --> 48:07.416
people uncomfortable,

48:07.417 --> 48:08.646
that's their issues

48:08.647 --> 48:09.874
that they have to work out,

48:09.875 --> 48:11.625
- because if you're walking down
- The street smiling,

48:11.628 --> 48:13.166
Ponies on your shirt,

48:13.167 --> 48:14.416
nothing can hurt you.

48:14.417 --> 48:15.917
-It has such a positive message,

48:15.918 --> 48:17.416
and it can...

48:17.417 --> 48:19.105
it's great at appealing

48:19.106 --> 48:20.791
to every end of the spectrum,

48:20.792 --> 48:22.541
both kids and adults alike.

48:22.542 --> 48:24.209
There's no bad

48:24.210 --> 48:25.874
this show can bring.

48:25.875 --> 48:27.250
-We had a particularly

48:27.251 --> 48:28.624
bad thunderstorm

48:28.625 --> 48:29.874
about a month or so ago,

48:29.875 --> 48:30.688
so the next morning,

48:30.689 --> 48:31.499
she told me,

48:31.500 --> 48:32.708
- she said, "Daddy,
- There was a big thunderstorm,

48:32.711 --> 48:34.042
- and it was really loud,
- And I got scared.

48:34.045 --> 48:34.957
I fell off my bed."

48:34.958 --> 48:36.082
And I said, "Arianna,

48:36.083 --> 48:37.167
why didn't you come

48:37.168 --> 48:38.249
and wake us up?"

48:38.250 --> 48:40.458
- And then she told me,
- I'll never forget, she said,

48:40.461 --> 48:42.083
"Oh, well, Daddy,

48:42.084 --> 48:43.707
Pinkie Pie came out of my TV

48:43.708 --> 48:44.667
and told me to giggle

48:44.668 --> 48:45.624
at the ghosties."

48:45.625 --> 48:47.459
Pinkie Pie taught her

48:47.460 --> 48:49.291
to deal with these fears.

48:49.292 --> 48:51.083
- You know, it's not about
- Loving a little girls' show.

48:51.086 --> 48:51.833
It's about loving

48:51.834 --> 48:52.582
these messages,

48:52.583 --> 48:53.916
and quite frankly,

48:53.917 --> 48:55.750
- if all these people
- Are following this show,

48:55.753 --> 48:57.167
Which has very strong

48:57.168 --> 48:58.582
happiness morals, you know,

48:58.583 --> 49:00.292
- be kind to your friends,
- Always be honest...

49:00.295 --> 49:02.855
Like, this is all good stuff,

49:02.856 --> 49:05.416
and people are following this.

49:05.417 --> 49:06.563
-My name is...

49:07.708 --> 49:09.333

49:09.334 --> 49:10.957

49:10.958 --> 49:12.396

49:12.397 --> 49:13.832
by the name of Bronies for Good.

49:13.833 --> 49:14.917
It's a solidarity

49:14.918 --> 49:15.999
support organization,

49:16.000 --> 49:17.124
not a charity organization,

49:17.125 --> 49:18.167
because we haven't filed

49:18.168 --> 49:19.207
a 501(c)(3),

49:19.208 --> 49:20.291

49:20.292 --> 49:21.541
So Bronies for Good

49:21.542 --> 49:23.292
- as an organization
- Within the Brony community

49:23.295 --> 49:24.792
Has raised 80,000 to 85,000

49:24.793 --> 49:26.291
US dollars,

49:26.292 --> 49:28.916
and that has gone

49:28.917 --> 49:30.750
- to the Children's Cancer
- Association,

49:30.753 --> 49:32.291
And to Your Siblings,

49:32.292 --> 49:33.833
- which had
- Three different projects

49:33.836 --> 49:35.291
That we helped fully fund.

49:35.292 --> 49:37.375
The first one

49:37.376 --> 49:39.457
was a clinic in Uganda,

49:39.458 --> 49:41.021
the second one was a sustainable

49:41.022 --> 49:42.582
village in Burundi,

49:42.583 --> 49:43.333
and the third one

49:43.334 --> 49:44.082
was the expansion

49:44.083 --> 49:46.291

57:50.897 --> 57:52.291

57:52.292 --> 57:54.084
and that show just inspired me

57:54.085 --> 57:55.874
so much as a kid.

57:55.875 --> 57:57.834
So... just being like them

57:57.835 --> 57:59.791

57:59.792 --> 58:01.207

- In weight lifting,

58:14.336 --> 58:16.250
- and they took me in
- And showed me the wraps,

58:16.253 --> 58:17.771

58:17.772 --> 58:19.291
"Hey, I'm gonna weight lift."

58:19.292 --> 58:20.396

- The new show and everything,"

was when I said, "You know,

01:05:12.106 --> 01:05:15.291
to feel secure in life.

01:05:15.292 --> 01:05:16.917
- Like, I know I'm a different
- Kind of person.

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.374
Like...

01:05:18.375 --> 01:05:19.582
I've gone through so... life

01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:22.750
just... just not fitting in,

01:05:22.751 --> 01:05:25.916
not really...

01:05:25.917 --> 01:05:27.708
- You know,
- Everything has always kinda been

01:05:27.711 --> 01:05:30.374
A one-size-fits-all society,

01:05:30.375 --> 01:05:31.417
you know, a formula

01:05:31.418 --> 01:05:32.457
that I never...

01:05:32.458 --> 01:05:34.166
I was always outside of.

01:05:34.167 --> 01:05:36.291
You gotta know what helps you,

01:05:36.292 --> 01:05:37.792
and I feel like, you know,

01:05:37.793 --> 01:05:39.291
I had a lot of crap in my life,

01:05:39.292 --> 01:05:40.980
but I don't feel like

01:05:40.981 --> 01:05:42.666
I'm any worse for it at all.

01:05:42.667 --> 01:05:44.125
And I love, I mean,

01:05:44.126 --> 01:05:45.583
I love my life.

01:05:49.708 --> 01:05:50.979
People regret the things

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.249
they don't do.

01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:53.396
You only regret the things

01:05:53.397 --> 01:05:54.541
you don't do,

01:05:54.542 --> 01:05:55.667
and I don't have

01:05:55.668 --> 01:05:56.791
a lot of regrets,

01:05:56.792 --> 01:05:58.124
because I go after...

01:05:58.125 --> 01:05:59.313
I'm not a "don't do"

01:05:59.314 --> 01:06:00.499
kind of person.

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.625
I think...

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:04.749
that's the only way to live,

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:05.667
but maybe most people

01:06:05.668 --> 01:06:06.582
aren't like me.

01:06:06.583 --> 01:06:08.354
Maybe most people aren't willing

01:06:08.355 --> 01:06:10.124
to just...

01:06:10.125 --> 01:06:11.313
you know, willing to go

01:06:11.314 --> 01:06:12.500
on that everlasting quest.

01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:35.646
-So we are on our way

01:06:35.647 --> 01:06:37.541
to BronyCon.

01:06:37.542 --> 01:06:39.874
It is 9:30...

01:06:39.875 --> 01:06:41.333
- I think it might be
- A little after 9:30.

01:06:41.336 --> 01:06:43.124
We're a little late.

01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:45.750
Um, it's an exciting time.

01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:48.396
All right, BronyCon,

01:06:48.397 --> 01:06:49.542
here we go.

-What's your favourite episode?

01:08:04.542 --> 01:08:06.084
-The first episode

01:08:06.085 --> 01:08:07.624
was pretty phenomenal.

01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:09.583
[Applause]

01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:15.707
-All right, so...

01:08:15.708 --> 01:08:16.520
-Bryan?

01:08:16.522 --> 01:08:17.332
-Yeah, just Bryan.

01:08:17.332 --> 01:08:19.999
-This is Bryan, just Bryan.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:20.916
-How you doing?

01:08:20.917 --> 01:08:22.041
-I'm really sorry...

01:08:22.042 --> 01:08:23.457
- you guys are going
- To hate me for this,

01:08:23.461 --> 01:08:25.000
But I haven't drawn in a year...

01:08:26.707 --> 01:08:27.938
-Show it to the crowd!

01:08:27.939 --> 01:08:29.166
Show it!

01:08:29.167 --> 01:08:31.082
-Show it to the camera!

01:08:36.625 --> 01:08:37.874
-There we go.

01:08:37.875 --> 01:08:40.332

01:08:56.335 --> 01:08:57.374
to be awesome?

01:08:57.375 --> 01:08:59.707
[Applause]

01:08:59.707 --> 01:09:01.167
-Okay. Okay.

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:06.438
-[As Applejack] F-forget you.

01:09:06.439 --> 01:09:07.666
I can eat all these apples.

"A puppy? A kitten?"

01:09:33.667 --> 01:09:36.042
- And, like, one guy in the back
- Goes, "It's a pony!"

01:09:36.045 --> 01:09:37.334
And I said, "I want that guy

01:09:37.335 --> 01:09:38.625
to do my tattoo."

01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:24.666
is sort of changing in a way.

01:10:24.667 --> 01:10:27.500
Like... not totally,

01:10:27.501 --> 01:10:30.332
but just...

01:10:30.333 --> 01:10:31.458
- there's a lot of people
- Out there

01:10:31.461 --> 01:10:32.813
That really love

01:10:32.814 --> 01:10:34.166
these characters,

01:10:34.167 --> 01:10:35.521
and, like, I'm by no means,

01:10:35.522 --> 01:10:36.874
like,

01:10:36.875 --> 01:10:38.042
in charge of what

01:10:38.043 --> 01:10:39.207
they say and do on the show,

01:10:39.208 --> 01:10:41.749
but I'm kind of giving them...

01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:43.582
I'm giving you life.

01:10:43.583 --> 01:10:45.271
I'm giving them,

01:10:45.272 --> 01:10:46.958
you know, a voice.

01:10:49.125 --> 01:10:50.167

01:10:50.168 --> 01:10:51.208
Yay!

And it's Applejack

01:10:56.751 --> 01:10:57.791
and Rainbow Dash

01:10:57.792 --> 01:10:59.749
singing together,

01:10:59.750 --> 01:11:00.875
and it looks like they're

01:11:00.876 --> 01:11:01.999
recording a pony script.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.960
- "Dear Ashleigh,
- Thank you for bringing an edge

01:11:03.961 --> 01:11:05.124
To My Little Pony.

You rock!"

And... oh,

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:13.374
with a note inside of it.

01:11:13.375 --> 01:11:18.041
"Your new Shell Phone.

01:11:18.042 --> 01:11:19.813
I have an incoming call

01:11:19.814 --> 01:11:21.582
for a Mrs. Atlantic Ocean.

01:11:21.583 --> 01:11:23.542
She wants to say hello.

01:11:23.543 --> 01:11:25.499
Will you accept?"

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.499
Hello?

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:28.959
Yeah, I guess I feel like

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:30.416
I'm a part of something.

01:11:30.417 --> 01:11:31.667
I'm a part of this movement,

01:11:31.668 --> 01:11:32.916
like...

01:11:32.917 --> 01:11:35.916
I'm not a Brony, but I'm...

01:11:35.917 --> 01:11:38.249
I'm, uh...

01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:39.854
I'm a part

01:11:39.855 --> 01:11:41.457
of these people's lives

01:11:41.458 --> 01:11:42.563
because I voice

01:11:42.564 --> 01:11:43.666
these characters.

01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:44.834
Yeah, before I left

01:11:44.835 --> 01:11:45.999
for this convention,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.417
I really wasn't sure

01:11:48.418 --> 01:11:50.832
what I was getting myself into.

01:11:50.833 --> 01:11:52.624
I was a little nervous.

01:11:52.625 --> 01:11:54.167
I wasn't quite sure

01:11:54.168 --> 01:11:55.707
what to expect

01:11:55.708 --> 01:11:57.582
and who these people were...

01:11:57.583 --> 01:11:59.332
like, who are Bronies?

01:11:59.333 --> 01:12:01.542
- I'd had a couple interactions
- In the past,

01:12:01.545 --> 01:12:04.499
But not at this capacity at all.

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:05.917
To get this response

01:12:05.918 --> 01:12:07.332
from any group of people

01:12:07.333 --> 01:12:08.957
is incredible,

01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:10.708
and it just happens to be that

01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:12.457
this particular group of people

01:12:12.458 --> 01:12:14.999
are mostly grown men

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.688
who are into this series

01:12:17.689 --> 01:12:20.374
about girl ponies...

01:12:20.375 --> 01:12:21.479
which is pretty bizarre,

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:22.582
when you think about it,

01:12:22.583 --> 01:12:23.999
but at the same time,

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.375
they're not doing

01:12:25.376 --> 01:12:26.749
anything wrong,

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:28.874
and they found each other,

01:12:28.875 --> 01:12:30.875
and I think it's an honour

01:12:30.876 --> 01:12:32.874
to be a part of that.

01:12:32.875 --> 01:12:35.083
- -Yeah,
- It's a beginning of something.

01:12:35.086 --> 01:12:36.332
It could fizzle out.

01:12:36.333 --> 01:12:37.625
- Things like this
- Have happened before.

01:12:37.628 --> 01:12:39.458
- There's a big rising tide,
- There's a force,

01:12:39.459 --> 01:12:40.541
And then it doesn't go anywhere

01:12:40.542 --> 01:12:41.417
because nothing

01:12:41.418 --> 01:12:42.291
picks up the torch,

01:12:42.292 --> 01:12:44.250
- and I really hope that something
- Comes along that will do that,

01:12:44.253 --> 01:12:45.625
- because
- This is not self-sustaining.

01:12:45.628 --> 01:12:47.457
It can't carry on forever.

01:12:47.458 --> 01:12:50.041
But it has so much potential

01:12:50.042 --> 01:12:52.125
- to just shape the way
- That we think about things,

01:12:52.128 --> 01:12:53.457
And make people be like,

01:12:53.458 --> 01:12:54.917
- "Oh, well, maybe it's just
- If something is good,

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.707
Then we can like it."

01:12:56.708 --> 01:12:58.083
- -People like to think
- It's just a TV show,

01:12:58.086 --> 01:12:59.541
It's not that big of a deal,

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:01.333
- and at the end of the day,
- Maybe that's all that it is,

01:13:01.336 --> 01:13:02.917
- just a small footprint
- In history.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.209
But so many people's lives

01:13:04.210 --> 01:13:05.499
have been bettered by it.

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:06.521
-I think the best part

01:13:06.522 --> 01:13:07.541
about being a Brony

01:13:07.542 --> 01:13:08.688
is that it just really is,

01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:09.832
you know,

01:13:09.833 --> 01:13:11.958
- like, it's more than a fandom.
- It's more than a community.

01:13:11.961 --> 01:13:13.791
It really is like a big family.

01:13:13.792 --> 01:13:14.999
-It's not about My Little Pony,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.333
- it's about
- "Friendship is magic."

01:13:16.336 --> 01:13:17.541
You know what I mean?

01:13:17.542 --> 01:13:18.917
- And about that sense
- Of solidarity,

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:19.957
That sense of community,

01:13:19.958 --> 01:13:21.374
and all those different things

01:13:21.375 --> 01:13:22.396
that really

01:13:22.397 --> 01:13:23.416
bring people together

01:13:23.417 --> 01:13:25.542
under a really wonderful

01:13:25.543 --> 01:13:27.666
umbrella.

01:13:27.667 --> 01:13:29.209
-It's not cynical, that it's

01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:30.749
just this positive oasis

01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:32.959
in a sea of sarcasm and cynicism

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:35.166
in modern society.

01:13:35.167 --> 01:13:36.230
The characters

01:13:36.231 --> 01:13:37.291
are well developed.

01:13:37.292 --> 01:13:39.249
They try to accomplish goals.

01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:40.500
If they fail,

01:13:40.501 --> 01:13:41.749
they learn from their mistakes.

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:43.166
They move on.

01:13:43.167 --> 01:13:44.792
It doesn't become this big,

01:13:44.793 --> 01:13:46.416
you know, ironic to-do.

01:13:46.417 --> 01:13:48.105
-Give Bronies

01:13:48.106 --> 01:13:49.791
the benefit of the doubt

01:13:49.792 --> 01:13:52.666
that they're all good people

01:13:52.667 --> 01:13:54.938
that like a kids' show

01:13:54.939 --> 01:13:57.207
for what it is.

01:13:57.208 --> 01:14:00.229
They aren't weird, deviant,

01:14:00.230 --> 01:14:03.249
you know, people.

01:14:03.250 --> 01:14:05.000
All they are are people

01:14:05.001 --> 01:14:06.749
who like a cartoon show.

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:08.332
That's it.

01:14:08.333 --> 01:14:10.000
-You've noticed how big

01:14:10.001 --> 01:14:11.666
the fan base has gotten so far.

01:14:11.667 --> 01:14:13.084
My question is, how much bigger
