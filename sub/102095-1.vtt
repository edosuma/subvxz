07:00.568 --> 07:04.973
Please...
What...

07:05.006 --> 07:08.877
What happened?

07:08.910 --> 07:11.547
Everything's going to be
all right.

07:11.580 --> 07:14.717
You can relax, it's okay.
I want you to close your eyes.

07:16.984 --> 07:20.556
We need to schedule
another procedure.

07:20.588 --> 07:22.924
Okay, sweet dreams.

09:07.095 --> 09:09.798
Ah!

10:39.086 --> 10:40.755
Unh...

10:52.768 --> 10:56.604
Aah!

10:56.638 --> 10:59.274
Help...
Help.

10:59.307 --> 11:01.309
Help?! Help!

11:01.343 --> 11:03.979
Aah! Help!

11:04.012 --> 11:06.681
Help! Help!

11:11.586 --> 11:18.626
Help! Help! Help!
Help me!

11:18.659 --> 11:21.129
Help! Help!

11:21.162 --> 11:24.832
Help!

11:36.878 --> 11:38.681
Hello, my name is Dr. Klein,

11:38.714 --> 11:42.318
and today I'd like to discuss
your postoperative recovery.

11:42.350 --> 11:43.918
Who am I?

11:43.951 --> 11:45.354
Why am I here?

11:45.387 --> 11:47.590
<i>These questions take on
a new significance</i>

11:47.623 --> 11:49.291
<i>here at the Klein Institute.</i>

11:49.324 --> 11:51.827
<i>Dealing with the necessary
immunosuppression protocols,</i>

11:51.859 --> 11:53.361
<i>memory loss,
and a host of</i>

11:53.394 --> 11:55.864
<i>psychological issues
will be a challenge.</i>

11:55.897 --> 11:57.333
<i>I realize that to look
in the mirror</i>

11:57.365 --> 11:59.033
<i>and see a stranger every day</i>

11:59.066 --> 12:00.668
<i>can prove to be more unsettlig</i>

12:00.701 --> 12:02.904
<i>than the fear of
tissue rejection itself.</i>

12:02.937 --> 12:05.773
<i>To hear your voice altered by
the many months of intubation</i>

12:05.806 --> 12:08.643
<i>and the changes in your mouth
and lips can be disorienting,</i>

12:08.676 --> 12:10.244
<i>but you must remember that
no matter</i>

12:10.277 --> 12:12.914
<i>the face that looks back,
you are you...</i>

12:12.947 --> 12:15.116
<i>the same person
you've always been.</i>

12:15.149 --> 12:16.951
<i>Although you may feel alone,</i>

12:16.984 --> 12:18.753
<i>you must remember
that you are surrounded</i>

12:18.787 --> 12:20.989
<i>by people that love
and support you.</i>

12:21.023 --> 12:24.158
<i>They may need time to adjust,
but rest assured,</i>

12:24.191 --> 12:27.061
<i>in time they will come to see
you for who you are.</i>

12:27.095 --> 12:29.297
<i>So I challenge you to be you,</i>

12:29.330 --> 12:32.133
<i>and to embrace
your new life.</i>

12:32.167 --> 12:34.268
<i>Now let's begin by going
through, step by step,</i>

12:34.301 --> 12:36.739
<i>what you can except over
the coming weeks and months</i>

12:36.772 --> 12:38.407
<i>with your new transplant.</i>

12:38.440 --> 12:40.109
<i>Our first challenge
will be avoiding</i>

12:40.142 --> 12:42.210
<i>some common side effects,
things like</i>

12:42.244 --> 12:45.013
<i>graft edema, acute respiratoy
distress syndrome,</i>

12:45.047 --> 12:46.882
<i>and jugular thrombosis.</i>

14:08.263 --> 14:10.132
Wait... Who are you?

14:13.167 --> 14:15.003
Who are you?

14:25.814 --> 14:29.351
<i>Dealing with the necessary
immunosuppression protocols,</i>

14:29.383 --> 14:31.186
<i>memory loss,
and a host of</i>

14:31.219 --> 14:33.789
<i>psychological issues
will be a challenge.</i>

14:33.821 --> 14:36.258
<i>Yet together, we can make ths
difficult road</i>

14:36.291 --> 14:38.794
<i>seem less daunting.</i>

14:38.826 --> 14:40.796
Dr. Klein created this
drug therapy

14:40.829 --> 14:42.898
specifically matched
to your DNA,

14:42.931 --> 14:44.833
dramatically improving
recovery times

14:44.865 --> 14:47.335
with only very minimal
side effects.

14:47.369 --> 14:50.471
In rare cases,
mild hallucinatory episodes

14:50.504 --> 14:53.241
and memory loss
have been reported,

14:53.274 --> 14:57.011
but nothing to be
concerned about.

14:57.045 --> 15:00.149
We're all so proud of you,
George.

15:00.181 --> 15:03.551
All the years of trial
and error.

15:03.585 --> 15:06.287
All the naysayers.

15:06.321 --> 15:10.125
You represent Dr. Klein's
greatest achievement.

15:13.460 --> 15:15.430
Well, I believe that, uh...

15:15.463 --> 15:19.268
this lovely woman would be kind
enough to offer you a lift.

15:19.301 --> 15:25.040
It took us a while,
but we found her.

15:25.072 --> 15:26.507
Good luck, George.

17:09.410 --> 17:11.545
You okay?

17:11.579 --> 17:14.316
I was in the hospital for...

17:14.349 --> 17:16.585
I don't know how long,

17:16.618 --> 17:19.521
and I didn't have one visitor,
not even my mother.

17:19.553 --> 17:21.089
Georgie.

17:21.121 --> 17:22.990
Not one, except...

17:25.092 --> 17:27.595
You are certainly not above
hurting people.

17:31.666 --> 17:33.234
Did I hurt you?

17:40.542 --> 17:43.177
You really got
whacked good, huh?

19:31.586 --> 19:34.156
Jesus Christ.
Fuck.

19:34.188 --> 19:36.524
Sorry.
I, uh...

19:40.294 --> 19:41.495
I thought...

19:41.529 --> 19:43.232
thought it was
a bullshit con, man.

19:45.733 --> 19:48.270
Look, um...

19:50.671 --> 19:53.674
if you want your job
back at the bar...

19:53.707 --> 19:55.410
stop by, all right?

21:02.209 --> 21:05.346
<i>Most patients experience
some significant</i>

21:05.379 --> 21:07.349
<i>but temporary memory loss,</i>

21:07.381 --> 21:12.219
<i>and in more rare occasions,
hallucinatory episodes.</i>

21:12.253 --> 21:14.589
I need you to dig deep

21:14.621 --> 21:17.391
and focus on relationships.

22:06.674 --> 22:08.743
Hey, George!

22:08.775 --> 22:10.445
I wasn't sure you'd come.

22:19.987 --> 22:21.689
It's good to see you.

22:26.694 --> 22:27.696
Hey, get a room!

22:27.728 --> 22:29.430
Hey, shut the fuck up.

22:31.898 --> 22:33.569
Grab a seat.

22:43.844 --> 22:45.513
We win big?

22:48.582 --> 22:50.252
You don't remember?

22:53.321 --> 22:54.688
Yeah, well, that's pretty
fucking convenient

22:54.722 --> 22:56.358
for you, right?

23:31.492 --> 23:32.994
Oh, wait...
yeah, wow.

23:33.026 --> 23:36.330
I was very jealous of you
for this one.

23:36.363 --> 23:39.466
She was nice, too.
You really fucked that up.

23:39.500 --> 23:42.003
But no redheads.

23:42.035 --> 23:43.671
Uh, no.

23:43.705 --> 23:46.941
Not that I recollect, no.

23:46.974 --> 23:49.077
But, uh...

23:49.109 --> 23:51.780
You, uh...

23:51.812 --> 23:53.982
you have a lot of secrets,
George.

23:57.718 --> 24:01.088
We were good friends, yeah?

24:01.121 --> 24:04.725
Known each other
a long time, yeah.

24:04.759 --> 24:06.428
What did I do that...

24:12.766 --> 24:14.068
I barely get to see my daughter

24:14.101 --> 24:17.371
because of getting
in too deep with you.

24:17.405 --> 24:19.907
I almost lost this bar.

24:19.940 --> 24:21.775
Still paying that off.

24:21.809 --> 24:23.678
We'll just leave it there,
all right?

24:28.515 --> 24:30.718
Tom...

24:30.752 --> 24:34.089
I'm not living like
that anymore.

24:34.121 --> 24:36.457
Yeah, well, I love you,
man, but, uh...

24:36.491 --> 24:39.394
you're gonna have to do a lot
more than bus a few tables.

25:19.100 --> 25:22.570
Relax.
I've seen worse, baby.

26:09.116 --> 26:11.519
If you're real,
say something.

26:17.492 --> 26:19.027
Do something.

26:31.606 --> 26:34.142
Get the fuck off me!

26:34.175 --> 26:37.479
Get off me!
No!

26:41.983 --> 26:46.053
Aah!
Get off me!

27:13.548 --> 27:15.183
He was right on me!

27:15.215 --> 27:17.819
- Where?
- No, he was right there.

27:17.851 --> 27:19.620
What are you talking about?
There's...

27:19.654 --> 27:23.157
- I...
- What happened?

27:23.189 --> 27:24.825
He was right there.

27:24.859 --> 27:26.561
But I don't see anything.
There's nobody here.

27:26.593 --> 27:28.562
I know, I know.
I saw it.

27:28.596 --> 27:30.865
It all happened right there.

27:30.898 --> 27:32.833
George, you ran to the bar,

27:32.867 --> 27:34.269
you come right back,
the body's gone.

27:34.301 --> 27:36.670
Are you sure it's not your meds
fucking with you?

27:40.174 --> 27:43.711
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

27:43.744 --> 27:46.813
I'm calling your mom.

27:46.847 --> 27:49.283
Somebody tried to take this!

27:53.888 --> 27:55.290
There's no blood, George.

27:55.322 --> 27:56.724
There's no blood anywhere.

27:56.756 --> 27:57.991
Maybe...

27:58.024 --> 28:00.061
I don't know.

28:00.093 --> 28:02.296
Um, the car just...
If...

28:02.330 --> 28:04.898
If he's not here, then he's out
there looking for me.

28:04.932 --> 28:07.903
I mean, are you listening to
yourself, how crazy you sound?

28:10.838 --> 28:12.807
All right, let's get you
to the ER.

28:12.840 --> 28:14.809
George.

28:14.841 --> 28:17.011
Let's get you to the ER,
all right?

28:17.043 --> 28:18.146
Y-you're a mess.
All right?

28:18.178 --> 28:19.147
- No!
- Your face is a fucking mess.

28:19.179 --> 28:21.215
No, no.

28:21.247 --> 28:23.350
I'm never going back.

28:23.384 --> 28:25.620
Do you hear me,
I'm never going back there.

28:31.125 --> 28:34.362
<i>Who am I?
Why am I here?</i>

28:34.395 --> 28:36.898
<i>These questions take on
a new significance</i>

28:36.930 --> 28:38.332
<i>here at the Klein Institute.</i>

28:38.366 --> 28:40.134
<i>Hello, my name is Dr. Klein,</i>

28:40.167 --> 28:42.203
<i>and today
I'd like to discuss</i>

28:42.235 --> 28:44.205
<i>your postoperative recovery.</i>

28:44.237 --> 28:47.041
<i>Every patient plays
a crucial role...</i>

28:51.044 --> 28:52.879
<i>After all, who better than
yourself to notice changes,</i>

28:52.913 --> 28:54.882
<i>discoloration, or movement
of the scar tissue?</i>

28:54.915 --> 28:58.386
<i>But I realize that

28:58.418 --> 28:59.786
<i>and see a stranger every day..</i>

28:59.820 --> 29:01.388
I don't want it anymore!

29:01.421 --> 29:03.090
It's not mine, now, take it off!

29:03.123 --> 29:04.958
I changed my mind!

29:04.992 --> 29:06.394
I stopped taking my pills.

29:06.426 --> 29:08.128
You've gotta take it off now!

29:08.161 --> 29:11.398
No! No!
I don't want it anymore.

29:11.432 --> 29:13.701
It's not mine,
I'm taking it off!

29:13.734 --> 29:15.269
I changed my...
You've gotta take it off!

29:15.301 --> 29:16.670
No, no!
Take it off!

29:16.704 --> 29:21.341
- Get away!
- Calm down!

29:23.811 --> 29:26.347
Take it off!
I don't want it!

29:26.379 --> 29:28.749
- Take it off!
- Calm down!

29:28.782 --> 29:31.753
Take it off!
No!

29:31.785 --> 29:33.821

Hello?! Hello!

Wake up! Wake up!

telephone, please.</i>

31:44.918 --> 31:48.822
George!
Hello.

31:48.856 --> 31:50.291
How are you?

31:50.323 --> 31:53.794
What happened to your chin?

31:53.828 --> 31:55.429
That's why I'm here.

31:55.462 --> 31:57.898
Jesus, we need to look
at that immediately.

31:57.932 --> 32:00.234
- You taking your meds?
- Yeah.

32:00.266 --> 32:02.068
All right, well...

32:02.101 --> 32:06.139
I wanted to talk to you about
a conference that the, uh...

32:06.173 --> 32:09.510
George, I wanted to talk to you
about a... a conference

32:09.542 --> 32:12.312
that the Radiological Institute
of North America

32:12.346 --> 32:14.048
have coming up.

32:14.080 --> 32:16.849
About you attending
as our guest of honor.

32:16.884 --> 32:18.419
If you're up for it.

32:18.452 --> 32:20.021
Am I the "before"
or "after" photo?

32:20.053 --> 32:22.989
Very good.

32:23.023 --> 32:25.225
Getting our sense of humor back,
are we?

32:25.259 --> 32:26.994
That's the spirit.

32:27.026 --> 32:29.462
I think the conference will do
wonders for your confidence.

32:29.495 --> 32:31.898
Really prove to you
how important you are

32:31.932 --> 32:34.068
for this whole program.

32:34.100 --> 32:36.137
Well, we'll talk.

32:36.169 --> 32:37.537
I'll see you inside.

32:37.571 --> 32:38.939
I'll alert the others.

33:10.036 --> 33:12.873
George!

33:12.907 --> 33:16.143
You scared me.

33:16.176 --> 33:18.512
Oh, my goodness,
what happened?

33:18.544 --> 33:22.649
I need to know
who my donor was.

33:22.683 --> 33:24.118
I'm sorry, George, but...

33:24.150 --> 33:26.153
Metzger won't tell me,
you know that.

33:29.490 --> 33:32.660
I know this is gonna sound
insincere,

33:32.693 --> 33:35.363
but you look good, George,

33:35.396 --> 33:37.365
you really do...
you're a miracle.

33:37.398 --> 33:39.000
You know that,
don't you?

33:39.032 --> 33:40.667
All of us on the floor
think so.

33:40.701 --> 33:44.538
I have a right to know.

33:44.571 --> 33:46.206
Please.

33:52.946 --> 33:55.148
I'm a single mom, two girls.

33:55.182 --> 33:58.252
I cannot risk my job, please.

33:58.284 --> 34:01.154
You know how I woke up
this morning?

34:01.187 --> 34:06.526
In my johnnies, on the floor,
on fire.

34:06.560 --> 34:08.529
I'm begging you.

34:08.561 --> 34:12.366
I'm losing my mind,
I need to know.

34:28.748 --> 34:31.185
It's the best I can do.

34:31.217 --> 34:33.219
Just trust me.

34:37.223 --> 34:38.992
Go.

35:12.493 --> 35:15.295
What'd ya do?

35:15.328 --> 35:17.697
It's gonna come out anyway.

35:17.730 --> 35:19.699
What'd you do?

35:19.732 --> 35:21.501
Nothing.
I was, uh...

35:21.534 --> 35:23.370
was, uh, attacked.

35:25.639 --> 35:27.642
It's a ticking time bomb.

35:29.676 --> 35:32.013
They all fail eventually.

35:34.281 --> 35:36.083
Our bodies are too smart.

35:38.351 --> 35:42.156
It never stops...

35:42.188 --> 35:45.426
ticking.

35:45.458 --> 35:47.328
Oh...
shh!

35:47.360 --> 35:49.397
- I can hear it.
- Please.

35:49.429 --> 35:51.531
You're a fool.

35:51.565 --> 35:53.501
We're alive, aren't we?

36:08.081 --> 36:11.085
Oh! Uh...
Hey, uh...

36:11.118 --> 36:13.520
Hey, how about a hand over here?

36:29.569 --> 36:33.173
I guess I should apologize
for the first time we met.

36:33.206 --> 36:34.842
Who are you?

36:34.875 --> 36:36.409
Uh...

36:36.442 --> 36:38.278
My name is Sophie.
Allen.

36:38.311 --> 36:40.714
- I'm a mental health...
- In my room.

36:40.746 --> 36:42.715
...counselor in the...

36:42.748 --> 36:44.317
You were in my room.

36:44.351 --> 36:47.188
Uh, thank you, James,
I'll get that later.

36:47.221 --> 36:49.657
We should probably get started.

36:49.690 --> 36:51.359
George, do you mind?

36:54.427 --> 36:57.130
Okay, uh, sorry
I'm late, you guys.

36:57.163 --> 37:00.200
Where... were we last week?

37:00.234 --> 37:03.471
Uh, Donald, I think it was
with you, about your sister.

37:03.503 --> 37:05.406
I wanna know
who my donor was.

37:08.542 --> 37:10.710
That's a subject
that comes up a lot.

37:10.743 --> 37:12.479
Right, guys?
But...

37:12.513 --> 37:17.284
Knowing doesn't necessarily help
the recovery process, does it?

37:17.317 --> 37:20.588
Plus, confidentiality agreements
prohibit contact

37:20.621 --> 37:22.590
between patient
and donor families.

37:22.623 --> 37:26.360
But if you want to, we can
discuss your feelings...

37:26.393 --> 37:30.331
This isn't about my feelings.
My donor attacked me.

37:30.364 --> 37:34.168
- That's not possible.
- I saw it with my own eyes.

37:34.201 --> 37:37.338
The man had no face,
it was real.

37:42.676 --> 37:46.246
Alexander...

37:46.279 --> 37:50.316
Hey, we're all doubling up
on our meds, okay, buddy,

37:50.350 --> 37:52.685
so back off!

37:52.719 --> 37:54.655
Um, I think we're gonna
call it there, guys.

37:54.688 --> 37:56.357
I'll see you next week, okay?

38:29.956 --> 38:32.792
Forgot to pay your rent?

38:32.826 --> 38:35.563
You followed me here.

38:35.596 --> 38:39.266
There's a reason
you came to see me.

38:39.299 --> 38:42.603
What was it?
Tell me.

38:42.636 --> 38:45.206
Please.

38:45.239 --> 38:46.540
Just tell me.

38:46.572 --> 38:47.574
I'm calling Dr. Metzger.

39:04.824 --> 39:06.460
You knew him,
didn't you?

39:12.498 --> 39:14.667
He's dead.

39:14.701 --> 39:17.737
You sure about that?

39:39.592 --> 39:42.362
I guess no one's come by.

39:53.406 --> 39:55.375
We look good together,
don't you think?

39:55.409 --> 39:56.844
It's none of your business.

40:01.714 --> 40:04.951
What was his name,
by the way?

40:04.985 --> 40:07.454
Eik.

40:07.487 --> 40:09.322
He was an orderly
at the hospital.

40:14.627 --> 40:17.564
Look, you got what you came for.

40:19.598 --> 40:21.534
I want you to leave now.

40:26.973 --> 40:31.679
I don't like you
going through his stuff.

40:31.712 --> 40:33.748
This expires in three days.

40:35.949 --> 40:37.518
That doesn't mean anything.

40:37.551 --> 40:38.985
No?

40:47.893 --> 40:51.431
Who are these people?

40:51.464 --> 40:53.032
What does this have
to do with you?

40:53.065 --> 40:55.535
I don't know.

41:00.107 --> 41:02.342
You tell me.

41:19.159 --> 41:20.127
There you go, on the house.

41:20.159 --> 41:21.594
Thanks.

41:26.967 --> 41:30.704
Why didn't he find me?

41:30.737 --> 41:33.005
If he was alive, I would
have been the first person...

41:33.038 --> 41:36.843
Maybe he was protecting you
from something.

41:36.877 --> 41:39.447
Maybe you didn't know him
as much as you thought.

41:41.547 --> 41:43.649
Look, the guy
had a photo of me

41:43.683 --> 41:46.520
'cause he was looking for me...
and he found me.

41:48.522 --> 41:50.391
That doesn't
make any sense.

41:50.424 --> 41:51.692
I know.

41:51.725 --> 41:53.025
How does a schmuck
who looks like this

41:53.058 --> 41:55.661
end up with a girl
looks like you?

42:01.802 --> 42:04.138
He was...

42:04.170 --> 42:05.873
He was funny.

42:05.906 --> 42:07.608
And smart.

42:12.078 --> 42:13.748
And I loved him.

42:16.817 --> 42:19.085
I didn't even realize
that they salvaged his...

42:21.487 --> 42:22.822
I had no idea
until I saw you.

42:25.625 --> 42:26.960
It was a shock,

42:26.993 --> 42:28.561
as I'm sure
you can imagine.

42:35.201 --> 42:38.938
Well, at least he left
something behind.

42:38.971 --> 42:40.674
Helped somebody in need.

42:48.848 --> 42:51.651
Hey.
What can I get you fellas?

42:51.685 --> 42:54.054
Yeah, uh, I'll take a, uh...

42:54.087 --> 42:56.590
apple martini.

42:56.623 --> 42:58.725
We're looking for George.

42:58.757 --> 43:01.661
Yeah, I, uh...

43:01.694 --> 43:04.096
I don't know any George.

43:04.130 --> 43:06.834
That's funny...
'cause his piece-of-shit car

43:06.866 --> 43:10.169
is parked down the street.

43:10.203 --> 43:11.839
Haven't seen him in months.

43:23.516 --> 43:25.752
What's up with your friend?

43:25.784 --> 43:27.654
Wear your seatbelt, that's what.

43:29.656 --> 43:31.157
You ain't kiddin'.

43:35.127 --> 43:37.730
Tell him to call this number.

43:37.764 --> 43:39.032
Tell him it's a burner
so he don't need

43:39.065 --> 43:40.567
to be worried about it,
you got it?

43:40.600 --> 43:42.134
Yeah, I got it.

43:42.168 --> 43:43.770
Then why the fuck is this
piece of paper

43:43.802 --> 43:45.138
still in my hand?

43:52.712 --> 43:56.250
By the way, I, uh, saw
somebody slashed his tires.

43:56.282 --> 43:58.018
Ain't that a shame?

43:58.051 --> 43:59.686
We'll be back.

44:07.761 --> 44:11.764
What the fuck, George?
Huh? Already?

44:11.797 --> 44:13.165
Why don't you call it a night,

44:13.199 --> 44:15.601
Before you get my place
shot up again?

44:15.634 --> 44:16.736
Sorry, miss.

44:16.770 --> 44:19.005
Use the back door.

44:19.038 --> 44:21.073
What was all that about?

44:21.107 --> 44:22.942
Apparently I'm a shithead.

44:37.290 --> 44:42.029
God, this is all
so confusing.

44:42.061 --> 44:44.831
I mean, I know he's gone
and you're not him, but...

44:48.268 --> 44:51.804
I don't think we should
do this again, George.

44:51.837 --> 44:54.073
- No?
- I'm sorry.

44:54.107 --> 44:56.243
- Look, please.
- I can't.

44:56.275 --> 44:57.911
Please.

45:06.619 --> 45:08.922
Wait.

45:17.931 --> 45:20.967
This was Eik's.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.336
I want you to have it.

45:46.058 --> 45:48.361
- What?
- Nothing.

45:48.395 --> 45:49.896
Uh...

45:49.929 --> 45:51.865
I don't know, the watch.

45:51.897 --> 45:52.932
Well, what is it?

45:58.304 --> 46:00.107
Well, it's nothing.

46:00.139 --> 46:01.942
It's, uh, really nice.

46:30.103 --> 46:32.172
We've done just about
all we can do.

46:32.205 --> 46:34.241
We need to schedule
another procedure.

46:34.273 --> 46:39.145
Sometimes a little pain can help
you feel like yourself again.

46:39.179 --> 46:41.214
What did you do?

46:41.246 --> 46:43.850
What happened today
cannot happen again.

46:46.886 --> 46:49.922
<i>Why don't you do...</i>

48:26.853 --> 48:29.255
Jesus!

48:29.288 --> 48:31.524
You scared the crap out of me.

48:31.558 --> 48:33.260
Well, it's you.

48:39.833 --> 48:42.135
You want one?

48:42.168 --> 48:44.938
It's bad for
the complexion.

48:44.971 --> 48:47.306
That was a joke.

48:47.339 --> 48:50.142
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

48:50.176 --> 48:52.212
Yeah, it's just
these damn pills.

48:55.614 --> 48:57.250
Mama's got a customer.

49:41.661 --> 49:43.263
- Someone's following me.
- Just stay away.

49:43.295 --> 49:45.464
I have no idea why.
I have to remember who I am.

49:45.498 --> 49:47.967
- I need your help.
- I barely know you, George.

49:52.170 --> 49:54.241
- I knew your donor.
- But you know about this, right?

49:54.273 --> 49:56.877
You know about triggering
memories, don't you?

49:56.909 --> 49:58.344
- I don't...
- There's someone following me

49:58.377 --> 50:01.146
and I don't know who it is
and I don't know why.

50:01.179 --> 50:02.915
I need to find out.

50:05.018 --> 50:06.052
Do...

50:06.085 --> 50:07.987
Childhood photographs?

50:08.020 --> 50:10.356
You've seen your mother,
you went to your apartment.

50:10.389 --> 50:12.525
There is one person
I haven't seen yet.

50:16.328 --> 50:19.298
But...
I don't wanna do it alone.

50:34.514 --> 50:36.516
Is that him?

50:36.549 --> 50:39.052
I think.

50:39.085 --> 50:42.389
Shut up!

50:42.422 --> 50:44.090
Yeah, that's him.

50:48.261 --> 50:49.963
This is a mistake.

50:52.565 --> 50:55.502
Remember why
you're here.

50:55.534 --> 50:57.237
Yeah.

51:22.427 --> 51:24.630
Well, what do you know?

51:24.663 --> 51:27.066
It's the masked man again.

51:27.100 --> 51:28.668
Holy shit,
I think this is him.

51:28.701 --> 51:30.270
What?

51:30.302 --> 51:34.574
Is that you, George,
behind that Mona Lisa?

51:34.607 --> 51:36.976
Why are you doing this?

51:37.009 --> 51:38.712
That's what we don't get.

51:38.744 --> 51:41.380
What's your angle?

51:41.413 --> 51:47.152
If you bozos did your research,
then you know who I am, right?

51:47.185 --> 51:51.123
Shit, what's that?

51:51.156 --> 51:52.458
That supposed to scare me,
old man?

51:52.491 --> 51:54.226
What the fuck are you,
some kind of cop?

51:54.259 --> 51:56.662
I'm worse.
Ex-cop.

51:56.696 --> 51:58.264
Fuck you,
we just want our money.

51:58.297 --> 52:01.134
You're trespassing, understand?

52:01.167 --> 52:03.302
I got every right here,
you both got shit.

52:09.509 --> 52:11.610
See you around real soon,
Georgie.

52:11.643 --> 52:14.647
- Real soon.
- Get the hell outta here.

52:19.252 --> 52:20.753
Nice playmates.

52:24.123 --> 52:25.625
Thank you for that.

52:34.299 --> 52:35.667
Friends of yours?

52:35.701 --> 52:38.103
I don't know.

52:38.136 --> 52:40.272
What's this supposed to be, huh?

52:40.306 --> 52:43.176
Ain't we been through enough,
your ma and I?

52:43.208 --> 52:45.177
What have you
been through?

52:45.210 --> 52:46.745
Tell me everything.

52:46.779 --> 52:49.482
Oh! Really?

52:49.514 --> 52:52.786
How I know it's you anyway?

52:52.819 --> 52:54.521
- What's going on?
- No, no, no, no.

52:54.554 --> 52:56.089
Mitch, George,
please, come on!

52:56.121 --> 52:57.623
Shut up!

53:00.460 --> 53:02.529
- How tall are you?
- Are you serious?

53:02.561 --> 53:05.165
You don't look like
my George.

53:05.197 --> 53:06.598
You don't sound like my George.

53:06.632 --> 53:08.501
The George I know sure as hell

53:08.534 --> 53:12.338
wouldn't have cowered
like some pussy.

53:12.371 --> 53:15.742
Whatever it is that happened
in the past, I'm sorry.

53:15.775 --> 53:19.279
Yeah, I know my shithead son.

53:19.311 --> 53:21.181
And I know...

53:21.214 --> 53:23.449
this ain't him.

53:23.482 --> 53:25.317
Well, you may be a fuck-up.

53:25.351 --> 53:29.389
But that's all you two
have in common.

53:29.422 --> 53:31.757
Whoever you are.

53:31.790 --> 53:34.360
Oh, please!
Please!

53:36.128 --> 53:37.697
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

53:43.735 --> 53:45.304
Just stop.

53:53.880 --> 53:56.683
It never goes like
it's supposed to.

53:56.715 --> 53:59.152
Not at first.

53:59.185 --> 54:00.686
Sophie,
what if he's right?

55:14.694 --> 55:16.396
What is it?

55:20.600 --> 55:22.302
This one patient...

55:26.839 --> 55:28.507
He stopped coming
to sessions one day.

55:28.540 --> 55:30.275
He just vanished.

55:35.714 --> 55:40.485
The last time I saw him, he told
me he was being followed.

55:40.518 --> 55:42.188
Just like you.

55:45.790 --> 55:47.426
He said it was like
this person...

55:47.460 --> 55:51.297
Wanted his face back.

55:51.330 --> 55:53.933
I don't understand.

55:53.965 --> 55:56.235
We've got to find the donors,
all of them.

55:58.603 --> 56:01.741
Yeah, if I could get...

56:01.773 --> 56:04.377
if I could get access
to the Reconstructive Wing.

56:04.409 --> 56:06.446
But it's restricted
even for me.

56:10.915 --> 56:12.618
Could I get in?

56:16.855 --> 56:19.891
I mean... if your face
was being rejected,

56:19.924 --> 56:22.294
or... or worse.

56:22.328 --> 56:24.431
But we don't want that.

56:27.933 --> 56:30.335
Promise me you won't
do anything stupid.

56:30.368 --> 56:34.607
No...
No, no.

56:41.746 --> 56:43.382
Hey, beautiful.

56:43.415 --> 56:44.984
Oh!
Great, look who it is.

56:45.016 --> 56:47.587
Back from the dead, again.

56:47.619 --> 56:50.422
Hey, uh, look who it is.

56:50.456 --> 56:52.959
The same loser who still
can't turn a profit.

56:52.991 --> 56:55.727
Oh, and your one lone customer,
Howie.

56:55.761 --> 56:57.797
Hey.
What are you doing?

56:57.830 --> 57:01.433
Ah!
Watered-down vodka.

57:01.467 --> 57:03.735
Up to your same old tricks.
You can put that on my tab.

57:03.768 --> 57:05.937
Easy, easy.

57:05.971 --> 57:08.373
You and I need to talk.

57:08.406 --> 57:09.841
What the fuck, man?

57:16.114 --> 57:17.949
What are you doing?

57:17.982 --> 57:19.985
- What are you doing?
- I need a favor from you.

57:20.018 --> 57:22.054
Am I in the fucking
Twilight Zone right now?

57:22.087 --> 57:23.989
Look, we both know
I've done you wrong in the past.

57:24.022 --> 57:26.658
- Yeah, and more than you know.
- Now is your chance.

57:26.692 --> 57:28.094
- Make it good.
- What?

57:28.127 --> 57:29.795
What are you
acting crazy for?

57:29.828 --> 57:30.962
- Tom.
- Yeah?

57:30.996 --> 57:32.432
You're a fucking idiot.

57:32.464 --> 57:33.832
What are you talking about?

57:33.866 --> 57:35.435
Can't see your daughter
and you almost lost your bar

57:35.467 --> 57:37.803
because of me, yet you
invite me back into your life?

57:37.837 --> 57:39.938
You know
how pathetic that is?

57:39.971 --> 57:42.007
You're a fucking loser.

57:42.040 --> 57:43.542
You think you've changed?

57:43.576 --> 57:44.911
You haven't changed.

57:44.944 --> 57:46.646
You know why you keep me around?

57:46.679 --> 57:47.814
'Cause you're a chump.

57:47.846 --> 57:51.049
Go ahead, right here.

57:51.083 --> 57:53.686
Right here.

57:53.719 --> 57:56.322
Do it, you fucking pussy.
Right here!

57:58.991 --> 58:01.994
Fuck.
Goddamn it!

58:06.165 --> 58:10.969
Open up! Please!
Open up! Open up!

58:11.002 --> 58:12.871
- Help! Help!
- Hey!

58:12.904 --> 58:15.774
Open the fucking door!

58:47.772 --> 58:51.743
I'm worried about
your tissue antigens.

58:51.777 --> 58:55.014
We've done just about
all we can do.

58:55.047 --> 58:58.851
We're mitigating
the inflammation, but...

58:58.884 --> 59:02.688
any more movement
of your scar tissue and...

59:02.721 --> 59:04.757
your face could
shift irrevocably.

59:06.759 --> 59:08.628
I'm concerned
about you, George.

59:10.795 --> 59:12.831
Disappearing the other day.

59:12.864 --> 59:15.600
Now this.

59:15.634 --> 59:17.570
I need you
to be honest with me.

59:20.605 --> 59:23.775
Did you hurt yourself?

59:23.808 --> 59:26.511
If you did,
you can tell me.

59:26.545 --> 59:30.215
It's not uncommon
with a transplant patient.

59:30.248 --> 59:33.785
Nothing to be
embarrassed about.

59:33.819 --> 59:36.855
I just want to make sure that
you get the appropriate care,

59:36.889 --> 59:39.025
both physically
and mentally.

59:42.228 --> 59:44.530
Tell me about Eik, doc.

59:49.201 --> 59:51.804
Well, that's a tricky road
to go down right now.

59:51.837 --> 59:54.172
Is it?

59:54.206 --> 59:58.010
Considering
your emotional state.

59:58.043 --> 59:59.745
But, all right.

59:59.777 --> 1:00:04.549
Dr. Klein insisted that we all
sign up to be donors.

1:00:04.583 --> 1:00:06.152
Set an example.

1:00:06.185 --> 1:00:07.853
I'm a donor myself.

1:00:10.188 --> 1:00:13.493
Eik saved your life.

1:00:13.525 --> 1:00:14.993
That's all
you need to know.

1:00:19.531 --> 1:00:22.033
I'm scheduling a psych
examination for you

1:00:22.067 --> 1:00:23.969
before I release you.

1:00:24.002 --> 1:00:25.504
It's for your own good.

1:00:25.538 --> 1:00:27.572
Is that a threat?

1:00:27.605 --> 1:00:29.542
Oh, George.

1:00:29.574 --> 1:00:34.179
Do you know how important
you are to me personally?

1:00:34.212 --> 1:00:36.548
I only want to help.

1:00:36.581 --> 1:00:39.585
And I need you
to be strong.

1:00:39.618 --> 1:00:42.822
For all those watching to see
you make a full recovery.

1:00:47.259 --> 1:00:49.061
Good timing.

1:00:52.063 --> 1:00:53.799
Get some rest, George.

1:00:53.831 --> 1:00:55.634
Please, think about it.

1:01:03.275 --> 1:01:05.043
That was incredibly
foolish!

1:01:05.076 --> 1:01:09.247
Well, it worked,
didn't it?

1:01:09.281 --> 1:01:11.951
What's that?

1:01:11.984 --> 1:01:13.585
Oh...

1:01:13.618 --> 1:01:14.986
I just, I got you...

1:01:15.020 --> 1:01:18.324
something that...

1:01:18.357 --> 1:01:20.025
Thanks.

1:01:24.295 --> 1:01:25.964
This is nice.

1:01:28.067 --> 1:01:29.135
Put it on.

1:01:29.168 --> 1:01:30.936
Now?

1:01:30.969 --> 1:01:32.605
Or later.

1:01:53.926 --> 1:01:56.862
- How do I look?
- Good.

1:01:56.895 --> 1:01:58.331
Thank you.

1:01:58.364 --> 1:02:01.000
Yeah, of course.

1:02:09.641 --> 1:02:11.910
I thought it might make you
feel more like yourself,

1:02:11.944 --> 1:02:14.246
despite all of this.

1:02:14.279 --> 1:02:17.684
Yeah, I guess you don't like the
old George's fashion sense, huh?

1:02:20.652 --> 1:02:24.656
That's fine, I guess you know me
better than I know myself.

1:02:24.690 --> 1:02:27.393
But...
this feels right.

1:02:27.426 --> 1:02:29.761
Yeah.

1:02:29.795 --> 1:02:32.298
Oh, yeah, sure.

1:02:34.333 --> 1:02:37.936
So, the donor files are located
in the HLA typing lab.

1:02:37.969 --> 1:02:39.904
It's usually locked with
a coded entry.

1:02:39.938 --> 1:02:41.674
What do you mean, usually?

1:02:41.706 --> 1:02:42.942
There are more people rooting
for you

1:02:42.975 --> 1:02:44.342
than you might think,
George.

1:03:25.083 --> 1:03:28.154
Yeah, baby, you know I do, damn.

1:03:28.186 --> 1:03:32.391
That bitch don't mean
nothing to me.

1:03:49.475 --> 1:03:51.009
I told you.

1:03:51.043 --> 1:03:53.412
How many times do I have
to tell you?

1:03:53.444 --> 1:03:56.281
You just keep on,

1:03:56.315 --> 1:03:57.883
keep on keeping on...

1:06:05.877 --> 1:06:10.248
It was supposed to
anesthetize my eyes, you know?

1:06:10.281 --> 1:06:13.351
But all I felt was liquid
flowing out, all down my cheeks.

1:06:15.453 --> 1:06:18.857
I guess they missed.

1:06:18.891 --> 1:06:20.993
Then they said
they couldn't wait.

1:06:21.025 --> 1:06:22.594
You know how,
in those old movies,

1:06:22.627 --> 1:06:27.298
when like the guy gets clobbered
and he starts seeing stars?

1:06:27.331 --> 1:06:29.301
Well, that was me.

1:06:29.333 --> 1:06:31.270
The pain was so intense,

1:06:31.302 --> 1:06:35.241
I swear I started seeing stars
exploding around my head.

1:06:44.415 --> 1:06:48.453
After I stopped screaming,
I could see the medic,

1:06:48.487 --> 1:06:51.991
like all the color
was drained from his face.

1:06:52.023 --> 1:06:54.993
I knew I must be
in serious trouble.

1:06:55.027 --> 1:06:56.427
Thank you, Chuck.

1:06:56.460 --> 1:06:58.464
I think we should probably just
cut off there.

1:07:12.476 --> 1:07:16.614
What is it?

1:07:16.647 --> 1:07:19.484
- What is it?
- Did you even know Eik?

1:07:19.518 --> 1:07:22.253
Yeah, of course.

1:07:22.286 --> 1:07:23.321
Why?
What does...

1:07:23.355 --> 1:07:25.357
Why haven't you gone
to the cops?

1:07:25.389 --> 1:07:26.424
George.

1:07:26.458 --> 1:07:28.293
Why haven't you gone
to the cops?

1:07:28.326 --> 1:07:30.128
Because if you knew that
Eik was onto something,

1:07:30.161 --> 1:07:31.964
that maybe they were
tricking donors or worse,

1:07:31.996 --> 1:07:33.464
- and you never reported it...
- Tell me what happened.

1:07:33.498 --> 1:07:35.234
- No, I'm asking <i>you.</i>
- George.

1:07:35.266 --> 1:07:37.136
Do you think
I'm involved in this?

1:07:37.168 --> 1:07:38.503
No, I don't.

1:07:38.536 --> 1:07:42.674
You wanna know?

1:07:42.708 --> 1:07:45.711
You gave me
Dr. Klein's watch.

1:07:45.743 --> 1:07:47.378
Dr. Klein?

1:07:55.286 --> 1:07:57.355
Why would Eik have
Dr. Klein's watch?

1:07:57.389 --> 1:08:00.326
- Yeah, exactly.
- I don't know.

1:08:00.359 --> 1:08:01.659
- I don't know!
- Why?

1:08:01.692 --> 1:08:03.094
He said it was a gift.

1:08:03.127 --> 1:08:04.228
What was your involvement
with Klein?

1:08:04.261 --> 1:08:05.596
- George, stop.
- Your involvement.

1:08:05.630 --> 1:08:06.632
- Stop!
- Were you two together?

1:08:06.665 --> 1:08:08.300
- No! God, no!
- Bullshit!

1:08:08.333 --> 1:08:09.668
What do you expect me
to believe?

1:08:09.701 --> 1:08:11.136
What do you expect me
to believe?

1:08:11.168 --> 1:08:13.038
George!

1:08:24.016 --> 1:08:26.418
'Cause I killed him.

1:08:32.490 --> 1:08:34.459
I killed him.

1:08:38.562 --> 1:08:41.734
Oh, G...

1:09:47.098 --> 1:09:49.401
Everything okay, George?

1:09:53.538 --> 1:09:56.208
I don't like the look
of that scar tissue.

1:10:03.481 --> 1:10:05.116
Can you smell that?

1:10:09.254 --> 1:10:11.390
How did Dr. Klein die?

1:10:14.459 --> 1:10:16.728
In a freak accident...

1:10:16.761 --> 1:10:19.665
In the lab.

1:10:19.697 --> 1:10:22.133
Here at the hospital?

1:10:22.167 --> 1:10:24.335
They still couldn't
save him.

1:10:27.438 --> 1:10:29.407
Poor bastard.

1:10:29.441 --> 1:10:31.844
Locked behind his lab door.

1:10:31.877 --> 1:10:35.481
Just 20 feet away from
the world's best trauma docs.

1:10:40.852 --> 1:10:42.555
Ironic, huh?

1:10:45.856 --> 1:10:48.560
Gonna have that doc
check you out, George.

1:10:56.267 --> 1:10:59.837
I need to be able
to trust you.

1:10:59.870 --> 1:11:03.241
You're all I have.
If I can't trust you, I...

1:11:07.379 --> 1:11:08.647
Come with me.

1:11:40.812 --> 1:11:43.582
He donated his body
to medical research.

1:11:43.615 --> 1:11:45.184
Now every department's
competing over

1:11:45.217 --> 1:11:46.919
who gets to use
the esteemed Dr. Klein.

1:11:46.951 --> 1:11:49.487
It's morbid.

1:11:49.521 --> 1:11:51.190
I need to know how.

1:11:55.794 --> 1:11:58.531
I confronted him in his lab
after Eik went missing.

1:12:00.932 --> 1:12:03.869
I accused him of stealing faces,
and he...

1:12:03.901 --> 1:12:06.737
Oh, God.

1:12:06.771 --> 1:12:08.740
It was self-defense.

1:12:14.945 --> 1:12:19.884
I grabbed glass tubes, jars,
whatever I could find.

1:12:19.918 --> 1:12:23.222
Turned out one was acid.

1:12:23.254 --> 1:12:25.824
He tried to strangle me.

1:12:25.856 --> 1:12:28.359
So I pushed him off and I ran.

1:12:28.392 --> 1:12:30.761
That's why I can't go
to the authorities.

1:12:30.794 --> 1:12:32.364
I thought they were gonna
get away with it, too,

1:12:32.396 --> 1:12:33.865
until I met you.

1:12:37.802 --> 1:12:39.938
But...

1:12:39.971 --> 1:12:41.674
What?

1:12:43.741 --> 1:12:45.578
I don't think
this is actually him.

1:12:47.879 --> 1:12:49.281
What do you mean?
Who is this?

1:12:49.313 --> 1:12:50.915
I don't know.

1:12:50.949 --> 1:12:55.620
Does a world-class surgeon
have chewed fingernails?

1:12:55.654 --> 1:12:57.289
Calluses?

1:13:05.062 --> 1:13:08.432
If he's still alive,
he won't stop.

1:13:08.465 --> 1:13:11.969
He was obsessed with his work,
his legacy.

1:13:12.003 --> 1:13:13.972
- Please, you have to believe me.
- Believe you?

1:13:14.004 --> 1:13:18.009
George, please,
I can't do this by myself.

1:13:18.043 --> 1:13:22.781
I don't know what happened to
Eik or why he had Klein's watch.

1:13:24.883 --> 1:13:27.419
But I do know that Klein
killed Eik

1:13:27.451 --> 1:13:28.986
and forced him
to become a donor.

1:13:29.020 --> 1:13:33.025
And if Klein's still alive,
it's gonna keep happening.

1:13:33.057 --> 1:13:34.592
Shit.

1:13:34.625 --> 1:13:36.294
- What?
- Shit. Come on.

1:13:40.397 --> 1:13:41.532
We've got to save her.

1:13:41.566 --> 1:13:42.768
Who?
Who are you talking about?

1:13:42.801 --> 1:13:44.335
No!
No, no, no!

1:13:44.369 --> 1:13:45.837
It's okay...
this way, this way!

1:13:45.870 --> 1:13:47.406
Hey, hey!

1:13:47.438 --> 1:13:50.642
I saw her get picked up
by that same white van.

1:13:50.674 --> 1:13:51.877
- Who are you talking about?
- And then...

1:13:51.910 --> 1:13:53.779
- What?
- And then she was downstairs

1:13:53.812 --> 1:13:55.447
with her face all marked up.

1:13:55.480 --> 1:13:56.947
George, they came
down here?

1:13:56.981 --> 1:13:58.984
Who are you talking about?

1:13:59.017 --> 1:14:00.385
Downstairs! Downstairs!
Fuck!

1:14:00.418 --> 1:14:02.587
What?! George!

1:14:06.357 --> 1:14:10.027
What the hell's happening?

1:14:10.061 --> 1:14:11.897
Wait.
I know you.

1:14:17.102 --> 1:14:18.637
George!

1:14:18.669 --> 1:14:20.571
No!

1:14:20.605 --> 1:14:21.673
George!

1:14:21.705 --> 1:14:23.107
Stay still!

1:14:23.141 --> 1:14:24.942
No!
No!

1:14:24.976 --> 1:14:26.678
Get off me!

1:14:26.710 --> 1:14:29.647
No, no!

1:14:42.927 --> 1:14:45.630
What did you do with Sophie?

1:14:45.663 --> 1:14:47.499
She's been terminated, George.

1:14:47.531 --> 1:14:48.900
No, no, no.
It's...

1:14:48.932 --> 1:14:53.471
it's not her fault,
you don't under...

1:14:53.504 --> 1:14:55.139
No, it's...
it's me.

1:14:55.173 --> 1:14:57.075
It's me.
It's...

1:14:57.107 --> 1:14:58.843
it's the meds.

1:14:58.877 --> 1:15:00.379
My mind is...

1:15:00.411 --> 1:15:01.512
So you're still having trouble

1:15:01.545 --> 1:15:03.615
remembering your past.

1:15:03.647 --> 1:15:04.982
Tell me what you remember.

1:15:05.016 --> 1:15:06.618
I remember...

1:15:06.651 --> 1:15:08.553
I remember my dad.

1:15:08.585 --> 1:15:10.821
I remember Tom,
my friend.

1:15:10.855 --> 1:15:13.058
I remember I'm in trouble.
I remember...

1:15:13.090 --> 1:15:15.593
I owe people money.
I...

1:15:15.627 --> 1:15:17.728
So there are people
who know you.

1:15:17.762 --> 1:15:19.598
Have you tried reconnecting
in a meaningful way...

1:15:19.630 --> 1:15:21.866
Yeah, but my dad doesn't even
want to acknowledge

1:15:21.900 --> 1:15:23.101
that I exist.
He doesn't even...

1:15:23.133 --> 1:15:24.869
All right, George,
your scarring's

1:15:24.902 --> 1:15:26.704
not healing the way we wanted.

1:15:26.737 --> 1:15:29.441
Your face has shifted under
the weight of the new damage.

1:15:29.473 --> 1:15:31.610
We need to reschedule
another procedure.

1:15:31.642 --> 1:15:34.413
No, no, please, I... I can't go
under the knife so soon.

1:15:34.445 --> 1:15:35.813
- Please, don't.
- All right.

1:15:35.847 --> 1:15:37.581
All right,
we'll cross that bridge

1:15:37.615 --> 1:15:39.017
when our options run out.

1:15:39.049 --> 1:15:42.052
But the best thing you can do
in the meantime

1:15:42.085 --> 1:15:44.123
is to start healing this.

1:15:46.191 --> 1:15:49.895
I need you to dig deep, confront
those hard relationships.

1:15:49.928 --> 1:15:52.064
Don't hide from your demons.

1:15:54.164 --> 1:15:58.436
Sometimes a little pain can help
you feel like yourself again.

1:16:02.906 --> 1:16:04.609
I know what I have to do.

1:16:04.642 --> 1:16:06.778
Good.

1:16:06.811 --> 1:16:08.480
Can I get a moment?

1:16:31.835 --> 1:16:34.940
Tom.

1:16:34.972 --> 1:16:36.707
Yeah, every...
everything's fine.

1:16:36.740 --> 1:16:38.543
I...

1:16:42.213 --> 1:16:44.014
I need one last favor.

1:17:03.668 --> 1:17:05.070
Tom?

1:17:07.237 --> 1:17:09.874
Tom?!

1:17:09.907 --> 1:17:12.977
Tom called your mother.

1:17:19.217 --> 1:17:20.685
You've gotta get
out of here.

1:17:20.718 --> 1:17:22.521
- What?
- Oh, no, you have to get...

1:17:22.553 --> 1:17:25.257
Your mother, in her heart,
she blames me, you know.

1:17:25.289 --> 1:17:27.993
Going to the track was something
I did with my own father.

1:17:28.026 --> 1:17:30.061
- You had to go and ruin it.
- Please.

1:17:30.093 --> 1:17:32.129
You have to go.

1:17:32.163 --> 1:17:33.865
You have to go, please.

1:17:33.897 --> 1:17:36.700
Look, hey...

1:17:36.734 --> 1:17:39.603
I've been around way too long...

1:17:39.637 --> 1:17:42.941
and I know how your
story's gonna end.

1:17:42.973 --> 1:17:45.744
But here...
Take this.

1:17:45.776 --> 1:17:49.146
It's the best I can do.

1:17:49.179 --> 1:17:52.650
Here.
Take it.

1:17:52.683 --> 1:17:54.218
It's a bus ticket outta town

1:17:54.252 --> 1:17:56.655
and three grand
to get you started.

1:17:56.687 --> 1:17:59.824
You said you changed.

1:18:01.926 --> 1:18:04.062
Go start anew.

1:18:04.094 --> 1:18:05.696
No, I can't.
You have to go.

1:18:05.730 --> 1:18:09.301
There's nothing good left
for you here.

1:18:09.334 --> 1:18:11.836
That includes your mother,
you understand?

1:18:11.869 --> 1:18:13.905
Okay, please, just go.

1:18:13.937 --> 1:18:16.641
Don't you recognize
a second chance when you see it?

1:18:18.276 --> 1:18:19.277
Please, just go.
Just...

1:18:22.146 --> 1:18:24.249
Please, Jesus Christ,
please, go.

1:18:24.281 --> 1:18:25.749
I tried.

1:18:25.782 --> 1:18:27.118
Just go, just go.

1:18:38.329 --> 1:18:42.000
Now, this...

1:18:42.032 --> 1:18:45.003
It's just like
the good old days.

1:18:45.035 --> 1:18:46.337
Hiya, Georgie.

1:18:46.370 --> 1:18:48.339
Where's, um...

1:18:48.373 --> 1:18:51.042
- that other guy?
- Let's settle this.

1:18:51.075 --> 1:18:52.744
Make it easy on everybody.

1:18:52.776 --> 1:18:56.347
But how do you know
you have the right guy?

1:18:56.380 --> 1:19:00.017
- Fuckin' games. Enough!
- How do you know?

1:19:00.051 --> 1:19:01.119
How do you know?

1:19:10.027 --> 1:19:11.896
You really don't remember,
do you?

1:19:11.928 --> 1:19:14.965
No! I don't.

1:19:14.999 --> 1:19:17.869
Huh.

1:19:17.901 --> 1:19:20.304
You're missing a tooth.

1:19:20.338 --> 1:19:23.241
You bit me,
you degenerate fuck!

1:19:25.677 --> 1:19:28.647
No, no, no, it's okay.
He's with me.

1:19:28.679 --> 1:19:31.950
No!
No!

1:19:40.792 --> 1:19:42.893
No! Dad!

1:19:42.927 --> 1:19:44.862
Dad... Dad!

1:19:44.896 --> 1:19:47.831
Dad! No! Dad!

1:19:55.440 --> 1:19:58.877
You said nobody
would miss the bodies.

1:19:58.910 --> 1:20:01.212
- What?
- Don't be fucking stupid.

1:20:01.245 --> 1:20:03.715
We delivered them
just like you asked for.

1:20:03.748 --> 1:20:07.085
Alive and kickin', and with
real pretty faces, too.

1:20:07.118 --> 1:20:08.953
No.
No.

1:20:08.986 --> 1:20:11.389
But enough,
you stupid sack of shit!

1:20:11.422 --> 1:20:15.360
I don't know what scam
you're playing at.

1:20:15.392 --> 1:20:17.462
I don't give two fucks.

1:20:17.495 --> 1:20:21.700
What, did that surgery
add testicles to you, too?

1:20:21.732 --> 1:20:26.203
What makes you think
you can fuck with us, Georgie?

1:20:26.236 --> 1:20:29.039
You better do the math
real fast.

1:20:29.072 --> 1:20:33.445
Or we're gonna take back
what we delivered.

1:20:33.477 --> 1:20:35.112
You follow?

1:20:44.288 --> 1:20:45.990
Ah, m...

1:20:48.926 --> 1:20:51.196
Dad! Dad!

1:20:53.530 --> 1:20:55.466
Dad, no.

1:20:55.499 --> 1:20:58.268
Dad, Dad, no.

1:20:58.302 --> 1:21:01.806
No, I'm... I'm sorry.

1:21:01.838 --> 1:21:04.475
Dad.
Dad, please.

1:21:04.508 --> 1:21:07.011
Who...

1:21:07.044 --> 1:21:10.215
Who... are you?

1:21:15.186 --> 1:21:17.121
Dad, no, no, no.
Dad, no.

1:21:17.155 --> 1:21:19.491
No, no, Dad.

1:21:19.523 --> 1:21:21.258
Dad!

1:21:21.292 --> 1:21:23.227
- George?
- Dad, no.

1:21:23.261 --> 1:21:24.963
Oh, my God.

1:21:24.995 --> 1:21:28.799
Oh, my God, George,
what happened?

1:21:28.833 --> 1:21:30.235
I worked for Klein.

1:21:30.267 --> 1:21:32.503
What?

1:21:32.536 --> 1:21:34.772
I worked for Klein.

1:21:34.806 --> 1:21:36.540
What are you talking about?

1:21:36.574 --> 1:21:38.243
What do you mean
you worked for Klein?

1:21:38.276 --> 1:21:40.111
I worked for him,
I found all of them,

1:21:40.143 --> 1:21:41.846
all the donors.

1:21:41.879 --> 1:21:43.848
All those marks, people
who wouldn't be missed.

1:21:43.880 --> 1:21:45.549
What?
George.

1:21:45.583 --> 1:21:48.052
Donors.
People who wouldn't be missed.

1:21:48.084 --> 1:21:50.855
I found Eik.

1:21:50.887 --> 1:21:54.024
Eik?
No.

1:21:54.057 --> 1:21:55.793
No, that's not possible.
We gotta go.

1:21:55.826 --> 1:21:57.427
- Come on.
- At least I know who I am now.

1:21:57.460 --> 1:21:59.396
- I know who I am!
- No!

1:21:59.429 --> 1:22:01.365
No, please, that's not you,
Okay?

1:22:01.398 --> 1:22:02.866
- That was Klein.
- Klein's dead.

1:22:02.900 --> 1:22:04.134
No, he's not!

1:22:04.168 --> 1:22:05.503
I'm the one you want,
I'm the one you want.

1:22:05.535 --> 1:22:07.004
George, look at me!

1:22:07.038 --> 1:22:08.373
George!

1:22:08.405 --> 1:22:11.176
Klein's not dead!

1:22:11.209 --> 1:22:13.344
Please.
He's alive.

1:22:13.377 --> 1:22:16.414
And he's coming for me.

1:22:16.446 --> 1:22:18.016
Please.

1:22:18.048 --> 1:22:19.149
Please.

1:22:19.182 --> 1:22:20.450
Come on, George, come on.

1:22:20.484 --> 1:22:22.286
Come on...
come on!

1:23:00.357 --> 1:23:02.259
No! George! Wait!

1:23:02.293 --> 1:23:03.494
- What are you doing?
- George! Get...

1:23:03.526 --> 1:23:05.963
Get the fuck off me!

1:23:05.996 --> 1:23:07.231
She's manipulating you,
George!

1:23:07.264 --> 1:23:08.999
You're not
thinking right, man!

1:23:09.032 --> 1:23:10.567
Enough!

1:23:14.472 --> 1:23:16.139
Klein.

1:23:16.173 --> 1:23:18.309
Klein!

1:23:21.978 --> 1:23:25.148
Stop this nonsense and return
to your rooms immediately!

1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:45.402
Take this thing off!

1:23:45.436 --> 1:23:47.672
What the f...

1:23:50.975 --> 1:23:55.112
Stop! Stop!

1:23:58.048 --> 1:23:59.216
Get it off of me!

1:24:14.432 --> 1:24:16.034
No.

1:24:45.129 --> 1:24:47.432
Hey... Hey, it's...

1:24:47.464 --> 1:24:50.435
It's all waiting for you...
Eh?

1:24:50.468 --> 1:24:54.539
Just like you left it.

1:24:54.571 --> 1:24:56.039
This is...

1:24:56.072 --> 1:24:57.441
this is not my fault.

1:25:52.596 --> 1:25:56.334
- He saw me!
- He saw you?

1:25:56.366 --> 1:25:59.236
Are you fucking serious?

1:25:59.270 --> 1:26:01.539
Not this shit!

1:26:01.571 --> 1:26:03.507
What should we fucking
do with her?

1:26:03.540 --> 1:26:05.509
Look, man, it's over.
He saw me.

1:26:05.543 --> 1:26:07.478
Oh, he saw your face?

1:26:07.511 --> 1:26:10.514
Doc insisted that we follow
the sequence.

1:26:10.548 --> 1:26:13.785
All you had to do was stay away,
stay hidden

1:26:13.817 --> 1:26:16.387
so he couldn't see you
until he woke up.

1:26:16.419 --> 1:26:18.388
Why the fuck are you out
of your room?

1:26:18.422 --> 1:26:21.125
I've done everything he's asked.

1:26:21.157 --> 1:26:22.826
When am I gonna be done
with this?

1:26:28.499 --> 1:26:31.803
When can I be done?

1:26:31.835 --> 1:26:34.704
When?

1:26:34.737 --> 1:26:36.807
When am I...

1:26:36.840 --> 1:26:38.375
- When am I done with this?
- Now.

1:26:47.351 --> 1:26:51.422
You said he'd have to go.

1:26:51.454 --> 1:26:54.458
You said
it'd have to be done.

1:26:54.491 --> 1:26:57.195
You did.

1:26:57.227 --> 1:26:58.695
You said a degenerate man
like that

1:26:58.728 --> 1:27:01.398
wouldn't be able
to stay hidden long.

1:27:01.432 --> 1:27:04.669
- You said...
- Don't understand.

1:27:04.701 --> 1:27:06.369
Wake up.

1:27:06.402 --> 1:27:09.406
Wake up, Doc.
Wake up!

1:27:09.440 --> 1:27:12.677
I've done everything
you've asked.

1:27:12.709 --> 1:27:14.878
Wake the fuck up
already, Doc!

1:27:14.911 --> 1:27:16.746
No!

1:27:16.780 --> 1:27:19.650
You're not him! No!

1:27:19.682 --> 1:27:24.354
No!

1:27:27.223 --> 1:27:29.226
No!
You're not...

1:27:29.259 --> 1:27:31.628
Remember what you said to me
when I saved you?

1:27:31.661 --> 1:27:34.898
Remember that?

1:27:34.932 --> 1:27:36.701
<i>Help me remember!</i>

1:27:36.734 --> 1:27:38.369
I don't know
what to do anymore.

1:27:38.401 --> 1:27:41.138
I've done everything
you've asked for.

1:27:54.517 --> 1:27:57.420
Wake up, Doc!

1:27:57.454 --> 1:27:59.190
Come on, already, fuck.

1:28:01.392 --> 1:28:03.194
Snap out of it, man.

1:28:03.227 --> 1:28:04.862
I've done everything
you've asked.

1:28:04.895 --> 1:28:06.397
Just tell me what to do.

1:28:06.429 --> 1:28:08.165
Just tell me what to do,
I'll do it.

1:28:08.199 --> 1:28:09.700
I'll do it.

1:28:09.732 --> 1:28:11.369
No...

1:28:11.401 --> 1:28:13.770
You knew your dad.

1:28:13.803 --> 1:28:16.173
You knew him.
You said, "That's him."

1:28:16.206 --> 1:28:17.542
Remember who did this
to you.

1:28:17.575 --> 1:28:18.776
Remember who
did this to you!

1:28:31.754 --> 1:28:34.458
You're not him...
You're not him...

1:28:34.490 --> 1:28:36.927
You're not him.
You're not him.

1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:39.629
Tell me what to do.
I'll do it for you.

1:28:45.636 --> 1:28:47.571
You're not him!

1:28:47.605 --> 1:28:49.874
You're not him!

1:28:49.906 --> 1:28:51.976
Tell me what to do
and I'll do it for you.

1:28:52.008 --> 1:28:53.843
- I'll do it for you.
- You're not him!

1:28:53.877 --> 1:28:55.946
Tell me what to do, Doc.

1:28:55.980 --> 1:28:57.982
Tell me what to do
and I'll do it.

1:29:01.819 --> 1:29:03.821
I think I love her.

1:29:39.757 --> 1:29:42.560
I saw what you all said I would
see, but I didn't remember.

1:29:42.593 --> 1:29:45.296
That...

1:29:49.432 --> 1:29:51.901
No.

1:29:51.935 --> 1:29:55.772
The only thing
I do remember is...

1:29:57.708 --> 1:29:59.377
you trying to kill me.

1:30:03.914 --> 1:30:05.782
You killed Eik.

1:30:09.486 --> 1:30:10.921
You turned me into that...

1:30:17.593 --> 1:30:20.830
So, what now, Sophie?

1:30:20.864 --> 1:30:23.301
Huh?

1:30:23.334 --> 1:30:26.537
What now?

1:31:57.160 --> 1:31:59.396
I hate you.

1:32:12.942 --> 1:32:15.980
I think I need
a new face.

1:33:32.688 --> 1:33:38.061
All of my dream
faded it seems

1:33:38.094 --> 1:33:42.967
Just like
the morning dew

1:33:42.999 --> 1:33:48.171
And every plan
that we both began

1:33:48.204 --> 1:33:54.244
Has all been
shattered, too

1:33:54.277 --> 1:33:59.182
I don't know why
I should cry over you

1:33:59.215 --> 1:34:02.052
Sigh over you

1:34:02.084 --> 1:34:04.922
Even be blue

1:34:04.954 --> 1:34:09.993
I should have known that
you'd leave me alone

1:34:10.026 --> 1:34:15.198
And break my heart in two

1:34:15.231 --> 1:34:20.870
Although you have left me
alone to pine

1:34:20.904 --> 1:34:26.009
All of my love
was a waste of time

1:34:26.043 --> 1:34:30.748
Someday your heart will
be broken like mine...
