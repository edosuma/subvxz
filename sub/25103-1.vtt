00:02.160 --> 00:04.037
Last season on Queen Sugar...

00:04.080 --> 00:05.911
I love this little dream,

00:05.960 --> 00:07.336
and Im going
to make it a reality.

00:07.380 --> 00:09.621
My sisters making history
today.

00:09.670 --> 00:13.458
First black woman to own a mill
in the state of Louisiana.

00:13.510 --> 00:17.844
This place is part of me.
Its home.

00:17.890 --> 00:22.008
-Me and Mama getting married.

00:22.060 --> 00:24.597
Love always comes first.

00:24.650 --> 00:27.107
You are the first woman
that I wanted to know

00:27.150 --> 00:28.765
since my wife, Charley.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.607
I think we can safely
diagnose your lupus.

00:31.650 --> 00:34.357
Would you consider marrying me?

00:34.410 --> 00:35.946
I have been telling yall
the truth.

00:35.990 --> 00:37.275
There was more
to the will.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.538
The farm,
he left it to just me.

00:39.580 --> 00:42.822
I uprooted my life, my son.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.410
Get out of the car, now!

00:45.460 --> 00:47.030
He takes out his gun

00:47.080 --> 00:49.128
and he puts the gun
in my mouth.

00:49.170 --> 00:50.455
And he pulled the trigger, Dad.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.047
You dont care about

00:52.090 --> 00:53.580
getting your work
to a larger audience.

00:53.630 --> 00:55.211
Thats not how I do things.

00:55.260 --> 00:57.888
Maybe it is how
you should do things.

00:57.930 --> 01:00.558
Blue... he may not be yours,
Ralph Angel.

01:00.600 --> 01:01.715
She said he aint mine.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.920
That he aint my son.

01:06.940 --> 01:09.511
Someones pitching a story about
internal issues at Queen Sugar.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.140
But there_ are
no Internal Issues.

01:11.190 --> 01:13.272
Dont let them white boys
get in your head.

01:13.320 --> 01:14.856
We got to take our cane
elsewhere.

01:14.900 --> 01:17.107
I want you to mill
with Boudreaux.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.867
-They tried to destroy Pop.
-Yes, they have tried.

01:19.910 --> 01:23.994
-So we got to change our game.
-You on some Godfather shit.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.998
Whatever play youre making,
youre playing with the devil.

01:27.040 --> 01:30.248
Itll be a slaughter
they never come back from.

01:33.710 --> 01:35.257
Dreams never die

01:35.300 --> 01:38.007
Take flight
As the world turns

01:38.050 --> 01:39.597
Dreams never die

01:39.640 --> 01:41.050
Take flight
As the world turns

01:41.100 --> 01:43.261
Keep the colors
In the lines

01:43.310 --> 01:44.550
Take flight

01:45.770 --> 01:47.010
Dreams never die

01:53.150 --> 01:55.983
Keep the colors
In the lines

01:57.860 --> 02:00.158
Keep the colors
In the lines, take flight

02:11.000 --> 02:13.662
Maybe Im indifferent

02:13.710 --> 02:15.200
Maybe Im not
Thinking straight again

02:15.260 --> 02:18.127
St. Jo Bears! Whoo!

02:20.010 --> 02:22.171
Drowning in decisions

02:22.220 --> 02:25.348
I cant see no way
To let you in

02:28.690 --> 02:31.102
I know I shouldnt
Play these games

02:31.150 --> 02:33.471
But why would you think
That I could change

02:33.520 --> 02:35.397
In the morning?

02:35.440 --> 02:37.567
Oh, oh

02:37.610 --> 02:40.488
Youre telling me
Time is on your side...

02:40.530 --> 02:43.021
-Hey.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.945
Your guidance counselors said

02:44.990 --> 02:47.117
that the college recruiters
are coming next week...

02:47.160 --> 02:49.151
Mom, this is like the fourth
time in the past 48 hours

02:49.210 --> 02:52.623
youve talked to me about
college recruiters. I know.

02:52.670 --> 02:54.490
Micah, you got to keep
these locked.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.126
I thought we moved here
because it was safe.

02:58.170 --> 03:00.218
Yes, that.

03:00.260 --> 03:05.095
And I just needed to separate
life and work a little more.

03:05.140 --> 03:08.632
Oh, Dad said hes coming home
in a few days.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.307
Oh.

03:10.350 --> 03:12.147
Is he finishing out
the season?

03:12.190 --> 03:14.146
Didnt sound like it.

03:17.230 --> 03:19.061
Look at you.

03:20.450 --> 03:21.906
My baby boy.

03:21.950 --> 03:23.906
-College-bound.

03:23.950 --> 03:27.113
Well, in a year and a half.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.491
Hmm. Yeah.

03:30.410 --> 03:32.742
-Im going to go.
-Okay.

03:41.630 --> 03:43.712
[cell phone chimes
and vibrates]

03:59.030 --> 04:00.486
I dont say this lightly,

04:00.530 --> 04:03.567
but your article last fall
was a stunning feat.

04:03.610 --> 04:07.068
I was--
we were blown away.

04:07.120 --> 04:11.159
Which is why we had to get you
to New York as fast as possible.

04:11.210 --> 04:15.169
We would love the opportunity
to bundle your articles

04:15.210 --> 04:19.089
in a book of essays chronicling
your perspectives on Katrina,

04:19.130 --> 04:21.587
the 9th Ward,
mass incarceration.

04:21.630 --> 04:22.836
Wow.

04:24.430 --> 04:27.422
Were prepared
to offer you a book deal

04:27.470 --> 04:29.961
with a six-ﬁgure advance.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.760
Ooh.

04:31.810 --> 04:33.186
-Mm-hmm.

04:33.230 --> 04:35.095
That... thats, um...

04:36.900 --> 04:38.470
okay.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.850
And Id be your editor
and point person.

04:41.900 --> 04:47.190
And Id just love to know
a little more about you.

04:47.240 --> 04:49.822
What were you like
growing up?

04:51.580 --> 04:55.038
I wanted to change the world.

04:55.080 --> 04:58.629
I was this rebellious
lIttle rug rat

04:58.670 --> 05:00.297
who drove her mom
and daddy crazy

05:00.340 --> 05:04.253
with statistics
and black political literature.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.757
I lifted my fist
for my neighbors,

05:06.800 --> 05:09.849
my classmates one flier,

05:09.890 --> 05:13.474
one petition, one high school
rally at a time.

05:13.520 --> 05:17.638
Its where I learned
the power of grassroots

05:17.690 --> 05:19.931
and community.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.180
Hmm.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.060
Well, we would like
to give you that.

05:25.110 --> 05:28.238
And you can leave
grassroots behind.

05:28.280 --> 05:29.656
This is much bigger.

05:31.580 --> 05:33.400
We see you
this time next year

05:33.450 --> 05:35.361
with your New York Times
bestseller,

05:35.410 --> 05:39.198
a college tour
of speaking engagements,

05:39.250 --> 05:41.662
op-eds in the Post,

05:41.710 --> 05:43.666
articles in Rolling Stone.

05:45.130 --> 05:48.714
We want your voice
to go global.

05:48.760 --> 05:51.172
We see you as the next
Ta-Nehisi Coates

05:51.220 --> 05:55.054
or Roxane Gay
or Elizabeth Alexander.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.931
Please, say yes.

06:05.570 --> 06:07.640
Blue!

06:07.700 --> 06:09.406
Hey, Blue, you ready
for school?

06:09.450 --> 06:12.328
Aint you supposed
to be getting ready, Blue?

06:12.370 --> 06:14.190
Come on. Come on.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.741
-I told you to get ready

06:15.790 --> 06:17.109
about 20 minutes ago.
Come on, Blue.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.121
Really?

06:20.170 --> 06:21.740
Thats what we doing?

06:21.790 --> 06:24.338
Come on, Blue, I aint got
time for this.

06:24.380 --> 06:25.836
I dont want to go.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.541
Oh, but guess what?
Youre going.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.926
Take your shirt off.
You know the drill.

06:32.970 --> 06:34.255
Come on.

06:34.310 --> 06:35.925
I got you.

06:37.310 --> 06:39.130
You dont got to look
so excited.

06:40.980 --> 06:43.107
I dont want
a Lunchable.

06:43.150 --> 06:45.527
Mom always
made me sandwiches.

06:45.570 --> 06:47.435
Well, I aint got nothing
to make sandwiches with.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.775
See all this stuff
Im stepping on?

06:48.820 --> 06:50.401
Put your shoes on.
Come on.

06:52.030 --> 06:55.443
I better not be hearing
from Mrs. Santiago again.

06:55.490 --> 06:57.742
Hearing about you
shoving kids.

06:57.790 --> 07:00.577
You keep your hands to yourself,
you hear me

07:00.620 --> 07:02.281
I told you,
these shoes were too small.

07:02.330 --> 07:04.207
I want ones like Micah.

07:04.250 --> 07:06.502
Is he going with us
to the game?

07:06.550 --> 07:09.212
Yeah, he going.
Everybody going.

07:09.260 --> 07:11.387
-Come on.

07:11.430 --> 07:13.796
Its nothing, thats what it is.
Its nothing.

07:16.890 --> 07:18.517
Why does it say
Mamas name?

07:18.560 --> 07:21.347
Because I got to send her
some stuff.

07:23.020 --> 07:25.397
All right, hurry up,
nosy.

07:25.440 --> 07:26.646
Come on, come on, come on.

07:26.690 --> 07:28.567
Some pep in your step.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.086
Charley Bordelon.

07:45.130 --> 07:46.700
What a pleasure.

07:46.750 --> 07:48.126
Miss Bordelon.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.215
Jacob.

07:52.010 --> 07:55.138
Boys, are we ready to sign
a contract for Queen Sugar?

07:58.810 --> 08:01.096
Jacob, if youll
excuse us.

08:03.770 --> 08:05.931
Give us the room, son.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.071
I thought we had a deal.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.441
We most certainly do.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.167
But about that final
stipulation

08:24.210 --> 08:27.338
that your fancy L.A. lavwers
managed to wiggle in there.

08:27.380 --> 08:29.951
You mean the 1%?

08:30.010 --> 08:33.252
Well, hell, Sam,
I figure it only fair

08:33.300 --> 08:37.259
ifI hand over
my entire labor of love,

08:37.300 --> 08:39.131
that I get a tiny piece
of yours.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.931
Lets be clear.

08:42.980 --> 08:46.302
I want you to consider
the 1% an act of goodwill.

08:48.110 --> 08:52.069
Having you as the continuing
face of Queen Sugar, well,

08:52.110 --> 08:57.195
it helps us keep up appearances,
if you know what I mean.

08:58.740 --> 09:01.573
And you have so kindly agreed

09:01.620 --> 09:04.407
to the locked rates
for the black farmers.

09:05.750 --> 09:07.911
The foundation
of this community.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.167
Least I could do.

09:10.210 --> 09:11.620
Hmm.

09:14.680 --> 09:18.593
Had you realized
the hard work

09:18.640 --> 09:21.461
that it takes to_ run
a successful busmess,

09:21.520 --> 09:24.227
we couldve saved you a lot
of heartache.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.930
Such a blow,

09:26.980 --> 09:30.108
to lose the farmers
last harvest.

09:31.570 --> 09:32.776
But now...

09:32.820 --> 09:34.356
now you get them back.

09:38.410 --> 09:41.948
Who wouldve guessed
you and me would end up here?

09:43.660 --> 09:44.900
Partners.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.081
Who wouldve guessed?

09:54.720 --> 09:57.211
Your daddyd be so proud.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.566
Ooh, I like the new color.

10:15.610 --> 10:18.818
-Hey, hey, hey!
Theres my girl.

10:18.860 --> 10:20.908
You bring me gifts, huh?

10:20.950 --> 10:22.360
You bring me gifts?

10:22.410 --> 10:24.617
-Oh, baby.

10:24.660 --> 10:26.491
I missed you.

10:26.540 --> 10:28.861
No, seriously,
where are my gifts?

10:31.380 --> 10:32.950
Is this what Italy
does to a woman?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.002
Oh, this is what jet lag

10:38.260 --> 10:39.887
Vi...

10:39.930 --> 10:41.136
how are you feeling?

10:41.180 --> 10:43.421
Good. Good!

10:43.470 --> 10:46.473
Holleoods out getting
sustenance for the pre-game,

10:46.520 --> 10:48.932
and some sort of doohickey

10:48.980 --> 10:52.609
so that he can show
our vacation photos.

10:52.650 --> 10:54.561
Wait a minute.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.987
Whats this
happy face for?

10:58.110 --> 11:00.021
New York?

11:00.070 --> 11:02.231
They offered me
a book deal.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.486
Hey!

11:03.530 --> 11:05.532
-Hold up now.

11:05.580 --> 11:07.866
Im thinking about it.

11:07.910 --> 11:09.787
Oh, child, please,
whats there to think about?

11:09.830 --> 11:12.321
I just need to make sure
its what I want to do.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.336
But the best news is,

11:14.380 --> 11:17.042
were about to celebrate
a big St. Jo Win.

11:17.090 --> 11:18.375
Hey-ho!

11:18.420 --> 11:20.172
Aah! Strut your stuff.

11:20.220 --> 11:23.712
What you got?
What you got?

11:23.760 --> 11:25.637
-Hey, hey.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.056
Miss Italian Lady!

11:28.730 --> 11:31.267
-Oh, Lord, I love you.
-I love you.

11:32.270 --> 11:34.352
Rolling Stone?

11:34.400 --> 11:36.140
College tours?

11:36.190 --> 11:37.851
You need a manager?

11:39.820 --> 11:41.560
I just dont want to be
the face of anything.

11:41.610 --> 11:43.487
Mm.

11:43.530 --> 11:45.521
I remember one summer,

11:45.580 --> 11:48.538
you put that big old picture
of Ida B. Wells on your wall,

11:48.580 --> 11:49.990
and you were all like,

11:50.040 --> 11:52.952
"Im going to be
just like her someday."

11:56.250 --> 11:58.548
Maybe this is your someday.

12:00.840 --> 12:03.297
-Oh.
-Aww.

12:03.340 --> 12:05.046
-Turn back around.
What you doing?

12:05.100 --> 12:07.091
Just turn back around,
the way you were.

12:07.140 --> 12:09.096
Making good use of that fancy
new Christmas present.

12:09.140 --> 12:11.131
-Davis did good.
-Hey.

12:11.180 --> 12:14.809
Dont lead with the fear
of what might be.

12:14.860 --> 12:17.761
Lead with the strength
of who you are.

12:20.110 --> 12:21.566
Hmm.

12:28.370 --> 12:30.440
I dont know why
these pictures aint pulling up.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.400
Micah, pass the remote control
right there.

12:33.710 --> 12:35.371
I” help you.

12:37.130 --> 12:40.372
Aunt Nova, were you on
the basketball team at St. Jo?

12:40.420 --> 12:43.423
Hell, no. She just went to watch
her boyfriends run around.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.130
Because they was fine as hell.

12:46.180 --> 12:48.216
But to answer your question,
young man,

12:48.260 --> 12:49.636
its the biggest game
in St. Jo.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.216
And tonight,
were going to kick

12:51.270 --> 12:52.885

12:52.930 --> 12:55.433
Damn right we are.

12:55.480 --> 12:57.471
Oh, check it out, check it out,
check it out.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.603
This is the venue were going
to use for the wedding, right?

13:00.650 --> 13:03.528
Oh, were going to do it
up right.

13:03.570 --> 13:05.447
Going to be the biggest wedding
St. Jos ever seen.

13:05.490 --> 13:07.230
Wow. You know,
you should be investing

13:07.280 --> 13:08.736
a good chunk
of that settlement.

13:08.780 --> 13:10.657
Make that money work for you.

13:10.700 --> 13:13.157
IRAs, real estate,
the stock market.

13:13.210 --> 13:15.781
Please, right now Im going to
need you to take several seats.

13:15.830 --> 13:18.708
-Okay. All right. Sorry.

13:18.750 --> 13:21.412
That is stunning, Holleood.
You have a theme, right?

13:21.460 --> 13:22.666
You guys have to have a theme.

13:22.710 --> 13:24.257
The theme is going
to be Venice.

13:24.300 --> 13:25.676
Whos going to be
your maid of honor?

13:25.720 --> 13:27.085
Nova, you cant ask that.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.755
Because clearly
its going to be me.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.303
I mean, what should I wear,
Aunt Vi?

13:31.350 --> 13:33.261
Something Italian?
Versace, maybe?

13:33.310 --> 13:35.221
We have not officially
settled on--

13:35.270 --> 13:37.682
Now, what were gonna do is
were gonna have a canal, right?

13:37.730 --> 13:39.550
We coming in
on the gondola.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.475
Yall going to come in
on a horse-drawn carriage.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.521
I have a great wedding planner
for you, if you need it.

13:43.570 --> 13:44.855
See, I dont even
need all that.

13:44.900 --> 13:46.390
I think you need to make

13:46.450 --> 13:47.735
a blue-themed wedding.

13:47.780 --> 13:50.442
Hey, Blue, Blue,
take it easy, okay?

13:50.490 --> 13:52.947
Its okay.
All right, so...

13:52.990 --> 13:57.666
why would a blue-themed wedding
be so special?

13:58.750 --> 14:00.035
Because its me.

14:01.670 --> 14:03.911
Because its you.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.258
Thats a really
good reason.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.151
You sign the contract?

14:33.790 --> 14:35.530
I did.

14:38.620 --> 14:39.860
Everything straight?

14:39.920 --> 14:42.286
Hmm! Sam Landry,

14:42.340 --> 14:44.877
he opened the door to his house
and let me come right in.

14:45.920 --> 14:48.423
So now with my 1%,

14:48.470 --> 14:51.382
Im going to make myself
just as comfortable as can be.

14:51.430 --> 14:55.969
Open access to all his
corporate records, financials.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.978
Im going to dig up
every square inch of dirt,

14:59.020 --> 15:01.682
and take down every
shareholder on that board.

15:01.730 --> 15:03.641
I” burn the entire
Landry family

15:03.690 --> 15:05.476
to the goddamn ground.

15:05.530 --> 15:09.694
And when I own
Landry Enterprises,

15:09.740 --> 15:13.733
well finally bring power
to the people, Rah.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.359
Where it belongs.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.491
See, I could dig that.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.186
This is St. Jo, huh?

15:49.240 --> 15:50.810
Classic, huh?

15:57.620 --> 15:59.406
Hey, Prosper.

15:59.450 --> 16:01.247
-Oh...

16:01.290 --> 16:04.282

for you in about three weeks.

16:04.330 --> 16:05.786

16:05.840 --> 16:07.205
The doctor gave me
some good meds.

16:07.250 --> 16:09.161
And I got this thing.

16:09.210 --> 16:10.711

16:16.760 --> 16:18.637

16:37.490 --> 16:40.243

16:42.540 --> 16:44.167

16:53.340 --> 16:55.638
You cant just be running around

16:55.680 --> 16:58.296
Youre going to get lost.
Hold my hand.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.171
Thatll be $9.50,
Officer Orson.

17:22.790 --> 17:24.030

17:30.630 --> 17:33.463
You guys have somebody
in the game?

17:33.510 --> 17:36.001
My oldest grandson

17:37.510 --> 17:39.387
You must be very proud.

17:39.430 --> 17:40.749
We are.

17:45.390 --> 17:46.630

17:48.440 --> 17:51.728

This is great.

18:48.370 --> 18:50.076

18:50.120 --> 18:52.372
Hey, uh, what happened
to Keke?

18:52.420 --> 18:54.911
I thought she was captain
of the...

18:54.960 --> 18:56.336
She thinks she got the flu.

18:56.380 --> 18:57.836
Oh, no.

18:57.880 --> 19:01.464
Well, tell her
if she needs anything...

19:11.730 --> 19:13.561
Whoo!

19:26.410 --> 19:27.820

19:50.730 --> 19:54.473

Basketball Classic.

19:57.860 --> 20:00.488
So this rivalry has been
going on for, like, 70 years.

20:00.530 --> 20:01.940
We got any alumni
in the house?

20:01.990 --> 20:03.776
Class of 96!

20:03.820 --> 20:06.402

2013 Collings homecoming queen,

20:14.710 --> 20:19.454
Miss Kacy Fleming,
to sing our national anthem.

20:23.470 --> 20:25.040
Looking good!

20:32.640 --> 20:38.010
O say, can you see

20:38.070 --> 20:42.848
By the dawns early light

20:42.900 --> 20:47.325
What so proudly we hailed

20:47.370 --> 20:51.989
At the twilights
Last gleaming?

20:52.040 --> 20:57.876
Whose broad stripes
And bright stars

20:57.920 --> 21:00.411
Through the perilous fight

21:00.460 --> 21:02.371
-Shh, Shh.

21:02.420 --> 21:08.962
Oer the ramparts
We watched...

21:11.850 --> 21:14.557
Sing, Kacy. Ignore them.

21:14.600 --> 21:18.513
Were so gallantly
Streaming

21:20.070 --> 21:22.482
And the rockets red glare

21:22.530 --> 21:24.646
You want to disrespect our flag,
get off the court.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.907
Go back to where
you came from!

21:28.910 --> 21:30.787
You stand up right now!

21:32.370 --> 21:36.283
Gave proof
Through the night

21:36.330 --> 21:39.037
Bunch of lowlife thugs,
disrespecting America.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.705
-Get them out of here!
Let them go!

21:40.750 --> 21:42.752
Let them go!

21:42.800 --> 21:45.507
Let them go! Let them go!

21:45.550 --> 21:48.257
Let them go! Let them go!

21:48.300 --> 21:51.383
Let them go!

-Bye.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.031
Are you going
to Barrys?

23:01.080 --> 23:02.957
And miss raising a beer
to a Collings slaughter?

23:03.000 --> 23:04.877
-Ill be there.
-Come on, baby, let me help you.

23:04.920 --> 23:07.753

23:10.010 --> 23:11.250
Wow.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.676
I told you to stop
pulling it so much.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.551
Come on, I got it.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.431
I can do it myself.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.686
I said I got it.

23:20.730 --> 23:22.607
Pop, stop.

23:22.650 --> 23:25.016
Fine. Go ahead.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.560
You got it.

23:31.030 --> 23:33.487
Hey, Ralph Angel.

23:33.530 --> 23:35.157
You need help

23:46.750 --> 23:49.548

23:49.590 --> 23:52.081

23:53.260 --> 23:54.716
What about it, Tamika?

23:56.310 --> 23:59.723
Well, I was thinking
maybe you needed somebody

23:59.770 --> 24:02.682
to help warm the other side
of your bed at night.

24:08.190 --> 24:09.487
Good night.

24:12.490 --> 24:13.809
You got my number.

24:35.090 --> 24:37.502
Hey, whats up?
-All right, peace.

24:54.780 --> 24:56.156
Hell of a night,

24:56.200 --> 24:58.191
even with all that pre-game
nonsense.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.980
-This is dope.
I thought we were going

25:00.040 --> 25:01.610
to have a riot on our hands.

25:01.660 --> 25:04.458
Why young folks got to bring all
of this onto the court?

25:04.500 --> 25:06.161
Theres a time
and a place for all that.

25:06.210 --> 25:07.837
Now I know yall aint
sitting over here

25:07.880 --> 25:09.086
with your beers

25:09.130 --> 25:10.495
talking crap
about a bunch of kids

25:10.550 --> 25:11.756
disrupting your precious
game.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.711
Not to mention bravely
taking a knee

25:13.760 --> 25:15.170
in front of all those people,

25:15.220 --> 25:16.960
racial slurs,
drinks being thrown at them

25:17.010 --> 25:18.420
trying to speak
their truth

25:18.470 --> 25:20.097
_ abo_ut _brothers
being slain in our streets.

25:20.140 --> 25:21.926
-Now, Miss Nova--
-He||, Id be damned

25:21.970 --> 25:24.973
if our fallen _Lou_isiana_ soldiers
werent turning in their graves

25:25.020 --> 25:26.806
listening to you two
wanting to silence

25:26.850 --> 25:28.852
those courageous
young voices.

25:28.900 --> 25:30.390
Here you go, baby.

25:30.440 --> 25:32.237
George, Phil, what yall talking
about over here?

25:32.280 --> 25:33.850
The importance
of young folk.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.027
And the things
they got to say.

25:36.070 --> 25:37.697
Ooh, this looks good.

25:39.870 --> 25:41.735
Make that boy pass the ball.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.530
Thats not my son.
You got to correct...

25:43.580 --> 25:44.990
Was Remy there tonight?

25:46.710 --> 25:48.325
Yeah. Yeah, he was there.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.292
Why didnt he... Remy!

25:58.010 --> 26:01.059
Holleood, go get that man.
Hes family.

26:01.100 --> 26:03.386
Yall need to stop
avoiding one another.

26:03.430 --> 26:05.091
Okay. Okay, I got it.

26:06.350 --> 26:08.511
Need a new drink anyway.

26:12.940 --> 26:15.431
I mean, come on. Five assists?

26:15.490 --> 26:17.856
Five games? Come on,
that aint enough.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.309
Gentlemen.

26:29.790 --> 26:32.543
Aunt Vi wanted you
to come and sit with us.

26:32.590 --> 26:35.878
You know youre still
a part of this family, and...

26:35.920 --> 26:37.421
whatevers between
you and me,

26:37.470 --> 26:40.291

26:42.560 --> 26:44.425
I appreciate that.

26:44.470 --> 26:45.721
I do.

26:47.730 --> 26:49.391
But with respect
to Violet,

26:49.440 --> 26:51.305
I think Im going to just...

26:51.360 --> 26:53.396
I think Im going to just

26:58.450 --> 27:00.156
-Good to see you.
-Yeah!

27:00.200 --> 27:01.519
Good to see you.

27:17.420 --> 27:19.047
Scotch on the rocks, please.

27:21.680 --> 27:23.716
I thought you were
a bourbon gal.

27:28.770 --> 27:31.091
Shows how little you know.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.857
Congratulations

27:33.900 --> 27:35.106
Id toast, but--

27:35.150 --> 27:36.560
What are you doing here?

27:36.610 --> 27:39.067
Supporting
the hometown victory.

27:39.110 --> 27:41.658
I go to all the games.

27:41.700 --> 27:44.112
I was a mean forward
in my high school days.

27:46.660 --> 27:48.116
Keep the change.

27:50.160 --> 27:53.948
Feels bad having a secret
like ours, dont it?

27:55.710 --> 27:57.416
Feels a little dirty.

28:09.390 --> 28:11.438
Another time, Jacob.

28:36.710 --> 28:38.541
Youre supposed
to be in bed, Blue.

28:38.590 --> 28:40.296
I am in bed!

28:42.300 --> 28:44.461
No, you aint.
I heard you.

28:55.650 --> 28:58.062
-Hi.
-Hold on.

28:58.110 --> 29:02.149
Ralph Angel, can we just talk
about this for two seconds.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.366
Its your mom.

29:07.410 --> 29:10.152
Hey, baby.
Ive missed you.

29:10.200 --> 29:13.454
I already picked out
The Secret Pizza Party.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.616
Auntie Vi brought it back
from Italy for me.

29:15.670 --> 29:18.241
-Its really good.

29:18.290 --> 29:21.259
Youre going to love it.
I already read it twice.

29:21.300 --> 29:23.370
Twice? Oh, my goodness.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.830
How was the basketball game?

29:26.890 --> 29:29.711
Pop wouldnt let me
have any candy.

29:29.760 --> 29:31.842
Well, were you being good?

29:31.890 --> 29:33.926
Because remember _
how we talked about listening?

29:38.810 --> 29:41.187
When are you coming
to get me?

29:46.410 --> 29:48.059
I know, baby.

29:49.370 --> 29:51.190
I miss you so much.

29:51.240 --> 29:54.323
I want you to come home.

30:06.470 --> 30:09.507
I thought that was so funny.

30:15.100 --> 30:16.340
Whats gotten into you?

30:22.110 --> 30:24.738
Now, why wouldnt you take
my hand at the game tonight?

30:30.070 --> 30:31.571
Oh, baby.

30:33.450 --> 30:35.827
I know you trying
to help me.

30:37.330 --> 30:39.161
And you do.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.869
But I dont need you being
all manly and protective,

30:45.920 --> 30:47.467
like Im going to break.

30:49.390 --> 30:53.633
Like you trying to put me
on some pedestal or something.

30:55.600 --> 30:57.511
Im going to always
lift you up.

31:01.230 --> 31:03.312
And Im going to always
protect you.

31:05.360 --> 31:06.645
Thats what I do.

31:06.690 --> 31:08.521
I know, baby.

31:08.570 --> 31:12.154
But you got to understand
that I dont need no pedestal.

31:12.200 --> 31:14.077
I aint gonna break.

31:15.080 --> 31:16.365
I got wings.

31:17.370 --> 31:18.610
Just like you.

31:21.630 --> 31:22.870
Right?

31:26.630 --> 31:28.166
All right?

31:53.620 --> 31:55.941

33:06.860 --> 33:08.930

33:18.740 --> 33:20.788

33:20.830 --> 33:23.242
Okay, well, sometimes

without saying anything.

33:48.900 --> 33:50.436
It was dope.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.351
That would never happen
at Gardini.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.356
Me and who else?

33:56.410 --> 33:58.901

Hey.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.576
You need to start unpacking

Yes, Mom, okay.

34:09.290 --> 34:11.793
Okay. Dont stay

34:14.170 --> 34:15.626

34:17.260 --> 34:18.750
Please?

34:23.680 --> 34:25.227
-Sorry.

34:25.270 --> 34:27.682
Now that you got
the whole town talking,

34:27.730 --> 34:29.015

34:45.830 --> 34:47.650

39:13.890 --> 39:17.178
Daddy never was able

39:17.230 --> 39:20.142
Rahs just trying
to prove he can.

39:22.270 --> 39:25.182
But it seems like hes got
a good handle on things.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.020
