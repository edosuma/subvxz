00:53.401 --> 00:55.469
Hello?

01:03.878 --> 01:05.444
Don.

01:06.580 --> 01:08.014
Don.

01:08.048 --> 01:10.250
Draper!

01:14.822 --> 01:17.891
Oh, Melanie. I'm sorry.
I must have overslept.

01:17.925 --> 01:19.893
They're coming before work.

01:19.927 --> 01:22.461
I told your service,
but you never called me back.

01:22.496 --> 01:24.430
There's no time for a shower.

01:29.035 --> 01:31.036
I'll make the bed.

01:41.915 --> 01:43.782
Thought you were having
the carpets cleaned.

01:43.817 --> 01:45.650
I did.

01:47.353 --> 01:50.622
I find it hard to believe I have
to replace it to sell this place.

01:50.656 --> 01:53.090
Couldn't you rent
a couple of pieces?

01:53.125 --> 01:54.892
It's so lonely.

01:54.927 --> 01:56.394
It's better.

01:56.429 --> 01:59.364
They can imagine
their own things in it.

01:59.398 --> 02:01.499
Have you ever sold
an apartment?

02:01.534 --> 02:04.302
I've sold a lot
uglier things than this.

02:04.337 --> 02:06.671
Can you go?

02:06.706 --> 02:08.673
I don't want you
crossing paths.

02:12.677 --> 02:14.578
Good luck.

02:29.594 --> 02:31.829
Hello?

02:33.097 --> 02:34.997
Yes, I'll accept the charges.

02:38.802 --> 02:40.603
Hello?

02:42.973 --> 02:45.341
Yes, Mom, you woke me.

02:45.376 --> 02:48.210
I don't know. I'm not
due at the office yet.

02:50.414 --> 02:52.147
Los Angeles
is three hours earlier.

02:52.182 --> 02:54.350
It's simple subtraction.

02:54.385 --> 02:56.352
I want to talk to him, too.

02:58.654 --> 03:00.756
Well, hello, sweetie.

03:00.790 --> 03:03.157
Do you know
how much I miss you?

03:03.192 --> 03:05.360
What did you and Grandma
Gail do this morning?

03:06.996 --> 03:08.963
Hello?

03:08.998 --> 03:10.965
Hello?

03:18.541 --> 03:20.608
Room service, please.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.844
I'd like a glass of skim milk,

03:23.879 --> 03:27.115
a grapefruit,
and a pot of coffee.

03:27.149 --> 03:29.317
And some French toast.

03:36.825 --> 03:39.260
- You wanted to see me?
- Come in. Have a seat.

03:40.963 --> 03:43.397
Can I offer you something?
A pad and pen perhaps?

03:46.000 --> 03:48.902
You know, I could have you killed for
drinking anything but a Coke around here.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.904
To whom it may concern?

03:50.939 --> 03:53.740
Our benevolent overlords
at McCann

03:53.774 --> 03:56.509
have invited select presidents
of select subsidiaries

03:56.544 --> 03:58.178
to a godless retreat
in the Bahamas.

03:58.212 --> 04:00.447
So you have to make a speech.

04:00.481 --> 04:02.949
That's what I thought. I figured
it'd be like a toast, you know?

04:02.983 --> 04:04.383
I'm good at that.

04:04.418 --> 04:05.919
Apparently Caroline
looked at the fine print

04:05.953 --> 04:07.587
and they're expecting some
sort of written statement

04:07.621 --> 04:09.989
on the future of this company.
2,500 words.

04:10.023 --> 04:12.024
- When?
- By Monday.

04:12.059 --> 04:14.928
It's plenty of time. Harry's writing
a manifesto on the computer.

04:14.962 --> 04:16.762
Chaough's doing
performance reviews.

04:16.797 --> 04:19.365
And they need to finish with a nice
Gettysburg Address type speech

04:19.399 --> 04:20.934
that tells them where
we're gonna be next year.

04:20.968 --> 04:22.568
<i>Mr. Sterling,</i>

04:22.602 --> 04:24.503
<i>there's a call for you</i>
<i>on line three.</i>

04:24.537 --> 04:26.805
Gettysburg Address.
Got it.

04:26.840 --> 04:29.007
I'd do it myself, but
one of us is very busy.

04:29.041 --> 04:30.742
You're going to the Bahamas.

04:30.777 --> 04:33.779
I'm sorry.
How are you doing?

04:34.914 --> 04:36.482
Never been better.

04:36.516 --> 04:38.851
Well, you've looked better. You
want me to get my barber in here?

04:38.885 --> 04:41.653
Anything else?

04:41.688 --> 04:43.588
Here are the specs.

04:43.622 --> 04:45.790
Just, uh, reasonable
hopes and dreams.

04:45.824 --> 04:47.158
Doesn't have to be
science fiction.

04:48.560 --> 04:51.296
<i>Roger?</i>

04:57.803 --> 05:00.105
You must be Dee.

05:00.139 --> 05:03.540
What a pleasure to meet
you in the flesh.

05:07.445 --> 05:09.913
Top of the morning.
How was your trip?

05:09.947 --> 05:11.615
So far so good.

05:11.649 --> 05:13.917
- How about that sun?
- Yes.

05:13.951 --> 05:15.585
Have you been
to California before?

05:15.620 --> 05:16.987
Listen, I've got
to run an errand.

05:17.022 --> 05:19.423
I'll be back. First
appointment is at noon.

05:19.457 --> 05:21.625
Did we have a cancellation?

05:21.659 --> 05:23.960
You're interviewing people
who already have jobs.

05:23.995 --> 05:26.162
They have to sneak out.
It's lunch or breakfast.

05:26.196 --> 05:29.332
Well, I thought we could
rank the candidates in advance.

05:29.366 --> 05:31.467
Come on, I did it, you did it.

05:31.502 --> 05:34.337
No need to do it together.
Santa Monica or Sunset?

05:34.371 --> 05:36.305
Sunset to Highland to Cahuenga.

05:41.746 --> 05:43.446
Why don't you show me around?

05:43.480 --> 05:45.515
How is the Beverly Wilshire?

05:45.549 --> 05:47.016
Have you seen Warren Beatty?

05:47.050 --> 05:48.717
Not yet.

05:50.219 --> 05:52.922
More money, bigger accounts,

05:52.956 --> 05:54.557
more awards,

05:54.591 --> 05:56.158
international business,

05:56.192 --> 05:58.027
and a space station?

05:58.061 --> 06:00.128
Gas station.

06:01.531 --> 06:02.898
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?

06:02.933 --> 06:05.100
- Do you have my thesaurus?
- Probably.

06:05.134 --> 06:07.869
Listen, you need to sign off
on the Peter Pan cookie.

06:07.903 --> 06:10.404
- He's very busy.
- Stay out of this.

06:10.439 --> 06:12.941
We can't take it out without you
signing off on it and you know it.

06:18.714 --> 06:21.382
- Let's go.
- Do you need me to set it up?

06:21.416 --> 06:23.184
No, just broad strokes.

06:25.420 --> 06:28.021
Peter Pan's best friend
is Tinker Bell.

06:28.056 --> 06:30.757
That's why his delicious
cookie is named after her.

06:30.792 --> 06:32.726
We have a series
of Dear John letters

06:32.760 --> 06:35.129
in children's handwriting
with kid voice-over

06:35.163 --> 06:36.863
<i>explaining why they've</i>
<i>left the competitors</i>

06:36.898 --> 06:38.932
for the unique taste
of Tinker Bell cookies

06:38.967 --> 06:40.968
made with real
Peter Pan Peanut Butter.

06:41.002 --> 06:43.737
Each letter has a little
joke about the competition.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.706
"Dear Nilla Wafers,

06:45.740 --> 06:48.141
it's so plain it's over.
Susie."

06:48.175 --> 06:51.712
"Dear Oreos, don't split
apart, I love another."

06:51.746 --> 06:53.580
"Dear Chips Ahoy,
I hope--"

06:53.615 --> 06:54.848
Okay, I get it.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.217
And then a cartoon touch
of the wand on the cookie.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.485
A sparkle.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.220
"Peter Pan Peanut Butter lovers

07:00.254 --> 07:03.289
love Tinker Bell cookies
more than all others."

07:05.426 --> 07:07.259
Jesus, love again?

07:07.293 --> 07:08.961
We use it all the time.

07:08.996 --> 07:11.931
Kids won't get it and
adults won't hear it.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.966
It's not up for debate.
Do we have another line?

07:14.001 --> 07:15.901
"One Tink
and you're hooked."

07:15.936 --> 07:17.870
What's wrong with that?

07:17.904 --> 07:19.371
I was worried.

07:19.405 --> 07:21.240
How will they know
Tink is Tinker Bell?

07:21.274 --> 07:24.276
Because you're gonna tell them
five times in 60 seconds.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.946
Are we still going to be ready?

07:27.980 --> 07:29.948
That's why we had this meeting.

07:34.787 --> 07:37.221
Jim McCloud is gonna be here any minute.
Where's Lou?

07:37.222 --> 07:39.428
He called.
He's running late.

07:39.463 --> 07:40.725
He called?
From where?

07:40.760 --> 07:42.527
Don't be mad at him.

07:42.561 --> 07:44.529
He's working on
something very big.

07:44.563 --> 07:46.131
What?

07:47.266 --> 07:50.034
Between us,
Hanna-Barbera.

07:50.068 --> 07:51.869
The cartoon studio?

07:51.903 --> 07:55.473
Yes. They're very interested
in this comic he created.

07:55.507 --> 07:58.909
It's like Gomer Pyle,
but he's a monkey.

07:58.943 --> 08:00.744
How long has this
been going on?

08:00.779 --> 08:02.546
Since he was in the army.

08:02.580 --> 08:05.749
- I think he misses it.
- That's not what I meant.

08:07.752 --> 08:10.353
Hello.
How are you?

08:10.388 --> 08:12.489
You must be Mr. McCloud.

08:12.523 --> 08:15.458
Yes. Yes, I am.
And you are?

08:15.493 --> 08:17.027
I'm Joan Harris.

08:17.062 --> 08:18.962
I'm an account executive
and a partner.

08:18.997 --> 08:21.198
Mr. Avery is stuck
in traffic,

08:21.232 --> 08:23.566
but I suppose we can begin.
I'm sorry.

08:23.600 --> 08:26.335
Dee, would you offer
Mr. McCloud some coffee?

08:26.369 --> 08:28.071
Please.

08:28.105 --> 08:29.305
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.

08:29.339 --> 08:30.639
I was catching up
with Jim here.

08:30.674 --> 08:33.176
Jim McCloud, Joan Harris.

08:34.778 --> 08:37.580
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure's mine.

08:37.614 --> 08:39.716
Jim, come on in.
Take a load off.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.417
Dee, can you get me a Sanka?

08:44.787 --> 08:46.722
Who are you?

08:46.756 --> 08:48.924
Richard Burghoff.

08:48.958 --> 08:50.926
I'm looking for my optometrist.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.961
Why didn't you say so?

08:52.995 --> 08:55.331
A woman like you
wants to talk to me--

08:55.365 --> 08:57.165
I'm a little nearsighted,
I'm not blind.

08:58.968 --> 09:00.603
Have dinner with me.

09:00.637 --> 09:01.903
I don't know.

09:04.073 --> 09:06.307
I want to see
if I can get the job.

09:08.410 --> 09:10.212
<i>Joan, are you coming or not?</i>

09:10.246 --> 09:13.248
- I have to go.
- French?

09:22.725 --> 09:25.827
Why am I signing these now?

09:25.862 --> 09:28.429
Because you sign it again
when they cash it.

09:28.464 --> 09:30.298
That's how they know it's you.

09:30.332 --> 09:33.934
But anyone who steals this
could copy my signature, too.

09:33.969 --> 09:36.203
They have it worked out, Sally.

09:36.238 --> 09:37.905
Why are you snapping at me?

09:37.939 --> 09:39.674
This trip was your idea.

09:39.708 --> 09:41.609
I'm going to miss you.

09:43.545 --> 09:46.247
You should really talk to them
about Colonial Williamsburg.

09:46.282 --> 09:47.749
You're driving right by it.

09:47.783 --> 09:50.151
It's 12 states in 12 days.

09:50.185 --> 09:51.652
They can't stop everywhere.

09:51.686 --> 09:54.488
Well, when I did the trip,
it was six states.

09:54.522 --> 09:56.090
Weren't they still colonies?

09:59.027 --> 10:01.162
We got into a little
bit of trouble.

10:01.196 --> 10:03.597
And I want you to know
that's to be expected.

10:03.631 --> 10:05.866
Trouble?
Really?

10:05.901 --> 10:09.036
You know, staying up all night.

10:10.405 --> 10:13.539
We would try and break
all the lightbulbs

10:13.573 --> 10:15.374
in the hallway at every hotel.

10:16.710 --> 10:18.945
We're not going to do that.

10:18.979 --> 10:21.380
Well...

10:21.415 --> 10:24.017
there are going
to be boys everywhere

10:24.051 --> 10:26.085
and you're going to be
away from home,

10:26.120 --> 10:29.088
so I hope you have
the good sense

10:29.123 --> 10:32.692
to not act like you've
been let out of a cage.

10:32.726 --> 10:34.660
I'm sorry, Mother,

10:34.695 --> 10:37.129
but this conversation
is a little late.

10:39.333 --> 10:41.099
And so am I.

10:42.168 --> 10:43.936
Everything is a joke to you.

10:54.481 --> 10:57.549
- How'd it go?
- About how I expected.

10:57.583 --> 11:01.353
They loved the lobby, but
the emptiness is a problem.

11:01.387 --> 11:03.188
There's other ways
to sell things.

11:03.223 --> 11:05.457
I'm using everything I have.

11:05.491 --> 11:07.826
But this requires
too much imagination.

11:07.861 --> 11:09.928
That's the best
opportunity in the world.

11:11.865 --> 11:13.332
Who's your best prospect?

11:13.366 --> 11:15.367
It was a young stockbroker
from New Jersey

11:15.401 --> 11:17.769
with a four-year-old
and one on the way.

11:17.803 --> 11:19.570
Why don't you tell them
somebody lived here

11:19.604 --> 11:22.406
who made a million dollars
inventing the Frisbee?

11:22.440 --> 11:26.143
And they had to move in a
hurry to a castle in France.

11:26.178 --> 11:28.479
Taxes.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.948
A little glamor, a little hope.

11:30.983 --> 11:32.884
I'm not a magician.

11:32.918 --> 11:35.386
I have to show it to people
with their eyes open.

11:35.420 --> 11:37.088
And you know
what it looks like?

11:37.122 --> 11:40.491
It looks like
a sad person lives here.

11:40.525 --> 11:43.060
And what happened to him?
He got divorced,

11:43.095 --> 11:45.661
spilled wine on the carpeting and
didn't care enough to replace it.

11:45.696 --> 11:47.163
Even for himself.

11:47.198 --> 11:48.698
Don't blame your failure on me.

11:48.732 --> 11:50.700
This place reeks of failure.

11:50.734 --> 11:53.003
It is an $85,000
fixer-upper.

11:53.037 --> 11:55.838
A lot of wonderful things
happened here.

11:55.873 --> 11:58.408
Well, you wouldn't know it.

12:03.547 --> 12:05.048
I have a good feeling
about things.

12:05.082 --> 12:06.883
See you tomorrow.

12:20.730 --> 12:23.498
You know I have
a very early flight.

12:23.533 --> 12:25.968
You are not going anywhere.

12:26.002 --> 12:27.970
I'm serious.

12:28.004 --> 12:30.838
Joan, I've been
in prison for five years.

12:30.872 --> 12:32.840
You're acting like it.

12:34.810 --> 12:37.278
Here's the plan.

12:37.313 --> 12:39.347
First, I'm gonna kiss you.

12:39.381 --> 12:40.581
I know the rest of this.

12:40.615 --> 12:42.550
Then you're gonna
cancel your flight.

12:42.584 --> 12:46.187
Then I'm gonna drive you
up to Malibu for lobster

12:46.221 --> 12:49.857
in one of those tourist traps
where everyone's getting engaged.

12:49.891 --> 12:52.292
Then on up to the Biltmore
in Santa Barbara

12:52.327 --> 12:54.594
where I'll sit
on a lounge chair

12:54.628 --> 12:57.197
and watch you get in
and out of the pool.

12:59.100 --> 13:01.568
Richard, that sounds wonderful.

13:01.602 --> 13:03.736
But I have someplace to be.

13:03.771 --> 13:06.440
And I'm sure you do as well.

13:06.474 --> 13:08.541
I told you, I'm retired.

13:08.576 --> 13:10.844
Yes.

13:10.878 --> 13:13.447
And you were
a millionaire developer.

13:13.481 --> 13:15.547
You must think
I just fell off a truck.

13:15.582 --> 13:18.084
Are you a movie producer as well?

13:18.118 --> 13:20.953
No.

13:20.988 --> 13:23.589
But the rest of it
is the truth, honey.

13:26.460 --> 13:28.594
What is the rest of it?

13:28.628 --> 13:31.563
I guess we've been
dancing around this all night.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.633
I'm divorced.

13:34.667 --> 13:36.135
You?

13:36.169 --> 13:39.805
You think I would be
doing this if I was married?

13:40.940 --> 13:42.908
Have you ever been married?

13:42.942 --> 13:44.843
Yes.

13:44.878 --> 13:46.578
Boy, did he blow it.

13:46.613 --> 13:49.548
He did.

13:54.153 --> 13:56.688
22 years.

13:56.723 --> 13:59.057
I stayed in it for the kids.

14:01.327 --> 14:03.461
And when my youngest graduated,

14:03.496 --> 14:05.963
I saw her heading off to Europe

14:05.998 --> 14:10.402
and I thought,
"Jeez, that looks good."

14:10.436 --> 14:12.670
I mean, hell,
I built something.

14:12.704 --> 14:15.640
I built a lot of things.

14:15.674 --> 14:18.410
But I also put off
a lot of things.

14:18.444 --> 14:20.578
And now I'm free.

14:20.612 --> 14:22.747
As a bird.

14:22.781 --> 14:25.483
I need to work.

14:27.086 --> 14:29.654
So you have mouths to feed?

14:31.023 --> 14:32.657
No.

14:35.126 --> 14:38.596
I just finally got the job
I've always wanted.

14:40.265 --> 14:43.267
So you're just an executive
on a trip out of town.

14:43.301 --> 14:45.603
I'll send you flowers.

15:03.444 --> 15:04.645
Morning, Meredith.

15:04.679 --> 15:07.547
Mr. Sterling came by
for your prognostication.

15:07.582 --> 15:09.282
I told him you were
at the library.

15:09.317 --> 15:10.818
That's not a bad idea.

15:10.852 --> 15:13.587
And can you dig up the press
release from when we started SCDP?

15:13.622 --> 15:15.455
That would be December '63.

15:15.490 --> 15:17.290
- Coffee?
- Morning, Don.

15:20.095 --> 15:21.629
No. I'll get it.

15:29.504 --> 15:31.271
Meredith got me two of these.
I only need one.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.473
Sure.

15:34.675 --> 15:36.143
When are you casting
St. Joseph's?

15:36.177 --> 15:37.410
Two weeks.

15:37.445 --> 15:39.579
Did you meet someone
we should see?

15:39.614 --> 15:43.449
No, just organizing
my schedule.

15:43.483 --> 15:47.119
You ever feel like there's less to
actually do, but more to think about?

15:47.154 --> 15:49.355
Not really.

15:49.389 --> 15:51.356
Maybe I'm a bad manager.

15:51.390 --> 15:54.592
Maybe I'm too, what do
they call it, hands-on.

15:56.062 --> 15:58.930
So, going to this casting session.
What's next?

15:58.965 --> 16:01.133
Shoot the ad?

16:01.167 --> 16:05.470
No, what's the future
going to bring?

16:07.173 --> 16:08.606
I mean, it's good as it is,

16:08.641 --> 16:10.475
but is there a scenario
in which it's better?

16:10.509 --> 16:12.644
You're incredible.

16:12.678 --> 16:14.979
You know, Roger asked me
to do that first.

16:16.948 --> 16:18.916
How'd you get out of it?

16:18.950 --> 16:22.353
I thought about it a little
and then I realized

16:22.388 --> 16:25.690
you're so much better
at painting a picture.

16:25.724 --> 16:27.192
So you did have thoughts.

16:27.226 --> 16:29.394
Sure.

16:29.428 --> 16:31.062
We'll have an oil company.

16:31.096 --> 16:32.863
You know, maybe Goodyear Tires.

16:32.898 --> 16:34.464
We know so much about cars.

16:34.499 --> 16:36.200
That's your dream?

16:36.234 --> 16:41.005
No, I mean, obviously
I'd like to one day--

16:41.039 --> 16:42.539
I don't know.

16:43.675 --> 16:45.609
What?

16:47.913 --> 16:52.750
I'd really love to land
a pharmaceutical.

16:53.952 --> 16:56.320
Bigger accounts?

16:56.354 --> 16:58.522
That's your greatest desire?

16:58.556 --> 17:00.490
That's why I'm doing
the performance reviews.

17:02.594 --> 17:05.229
You know, before McCann
all I ever thought of

17:05.262 --> 17:07.030
was will we be
in business next year?

17:07.064 --> 17:09.233
Or will I be here at all?

17:09.267 --> 17:12.035
Now it could be anything.

17:17.842 --> 17:20.276
<i>I have a Richard
Burghoff on the line.</i>

17:21.979 --> 17:23.679
I'll take it.

17:28.452 --> 17:30.220
Hello.

17:30.254 --> 17:33.522
Well, your story checks out.

17:35.626 --> 17:37.827
It's nice to hear from you.

17:37.862 --> 17:39.562
How are things in paradise?

17:39.596 --> 17:41.830
I don't know.
I'm in town.

17:41.865 --> 17:43.899
What?
You're in New York?

17:43.933 --> 17:46.034
Tell me where we're eating.

17:47.471 --> 17:49.872
The Oak Room, 7:30.

17:49.906 --> 17:52.040
Should I pick you up
at work or at home?

17:52.075 --> 17:53.676
I'll see you there.

17:53.710 --> 17:55.511
Well, good.

17:55.545 --> 17:57.846
You can make an entrance.

18:10.726 --> 18:12.527
There you are.

18:12.561 --> 18:13.996
There <i>you</i> are.

18:14.030 --> 18:16.064
We have a peanut butter
cookie problem.

18:16.099 --> 18:19.201
Don, don't listen to him.
Pete, what are you doing?

18:19.235 --> 18:22.437
- The client hated the layout.
- Exactly, that's the problem.

18:22.471 --> 18:25.507
And then Mathis and Ed
turned on each other.

18:25.541 --> 18:28.109
There was some kind of
"I told you so" exchange

18:28.143 --> 18:31.713
which was already
unbearably inappropriate.

18:31.747 --> 18:34.382
And then Mathis said...

18:34.417 --> 18:36.184
a four-letter word
that starts with F.

18:36.218 --> 18:37.719
Have you ever heard
such a thing?

18:37.753 --> 18:40.054
He was frustrated.
He can't fire my men.

18:40.088 --> 18:42.156
- I can fire you.
- Hold on.

18:42.191 --> 18:43.757
Nobody's getting fired.

18:43.792 --> 18:46.327
- You have to send those idiots back in.
- Absolutely not.

18:46.361 --> 18:48.862
If you send someone new,
it looks like we're starting over.

18:48.896 --> 18:51.832
It was a crime of passion.
They've heard the word before.

18:51.866 --> 18:54.435
Fine.

18:54.469 --> 18:56.269
I want new work fast.

18:56.304 --> 18:57.904
Problem solved.

19:08.282 --> 19:09.649
May I help you?

19:09.683 --> 19:12.552
Is Sally home?
I'm a friend of hers.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.387
Sally.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.489
There's a young man
here to see you.

19:18.159 --> 19:21.127
- What's your name, ma'am?
- It's Loretta.

19:21.162 --> 19:23.063
Is Mrs. Draper home?

19:23.097 --> 19:24.764
You mean Mrs. Francis.

19:24.798 --> 19:26.366
What are you doing here?

19:27.901 --> 19:29.736
I was in the neighborhood.

19:31.405 --> 19:33.673
You know Betty's home.

19:33.707 --> 19:35.975
I don't care.
I just wanted to see you.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.110
See?
You survived finals.

19:39.780 --> 19:42.715
- How's your summer?
- I'm going on a teen tour.

19:42.750 --> 19:44.484
Then maybe be
a lifeguard again.

19:44.518 --> 19:46.718
Do you have something
to do right now?

19:46.753 --> 19:48.987
I got it.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.122
I got it.

19:51.156 --> 19:52.858
Hey, I'll be out in a second.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.126
I have to use the restroom.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.295
This is Paula.
This is Sally.

19:57.329 --> 20:00.632
Hey there. Could you get me
a map to the powder room?

20:00.666 --> 20:02.801
First door on the left.

20:04.270 --> 20:07.938
- Hello.
- You have a lovely home.

20:07.972 --> 20:11.909
Sally, I didn't know
you had guests.

20:13.912 --> 20:15.746
We just dropped by.

20:15.781 --> 20:18.148
We were on our way to Playland and
thought maybe you'd want to come.

20:19.851 --> 20:22.319
Aren't you going
to introduce me?

20:24.622 --> 20:25.988
I'm Glen Bishop.

20:26.023 --> 20:27.857
We lived up the street
in Ossining.

20:29.126 --> 20:31.394
Glen?

20:31.429 --> 20:33.463
My goodness.

20:33.497 --> 20:34.964
How old are you?

20:34.998 --> 20:36.599
18.

20:38.135 --> 20:40.236
So, you two
have stayed in touch?

20:40.270 --> 20:42.639
- Yeah.
- We've been pen pals.

20:42.673 --> 20:44.541
What have you been
doing with yourself?

20:44.575 --> 20:46.576
You look so different.

20:46.610 --> 20:48.944
You look exactly the same.

20:50.647 --> 20:52.915
Good, you found my backpack.

20:52.949 --> 20:54.683
Yes, it was in
the storage room.

20:54.717 --> 20:56.852
You must be in school.

20:56.886 --> 20:58.887
Yeah, just finished my
freshman year up at Purchase.

20:58.922 --> 21:00.689
That's supposed
to be very good.

21:00.723 --> 21:03.158
I'm actually going back
to school myself this fall.

21:03.192 --> 21:05.694
Very cool.

21:09.698 --> 21:12.400
Can I have some actual money
to take to Playland?

21:12.435 --> 21:15.670
What? Of course.
Go get my pocketbook.

21:15.704 --> 21:17.305
Can't you?

21:19.508 --> 21:22.110
Hey. Sorry for
running past you.

21:22.144 --> 21:24.446
My mother hates that.
Just really had to go.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.414
That's quite all right.

21:26.449 --> 21:28.315
Can I offer you all
something to drink?

21:28.350 --> 21:29.916
- Iced tea?
- No.

21:29.951 --> 21:31.418
I'd take a beer
if you've got one.

21:31.453 --> 21:32.886
- Of course.
- Hold on.

21:32.920 --> 21:35.755
I thought we were going to Playland.
Are you coming?

21:35.790 --> 21:38.825
I'd love to go with you,
but I don't have any money.

21:38.860 --> 21:41.395
Do you talk to
your parents this way?

21:44.599 --> 21:47.066
Do you have any grass?

21:47.101 --> 21:49.268
We can get it there.

21:51.338 --> 21:54.374
Don't stay too late.
You have to pack.

21:54.408 --> 21:56.642
Nice meeting you.

21:56.676 --> 21:59.212
Enjoy the rest of your summer.

21:59.246 --> 22:02.215
- Betty.
- Yes?

22:02.249 --> 22:04.950
I feel like I should say
a more formal good-bye.

22:06.553 --> 22:08.487
Nonsense.

22:08.522 --> 22:09.922
You're welcome here anytime.

22:09.956 --> 22:11.724
No.

22:11.758 --> 22:14.226
It's just that...

22:14.260 --> 22:16.128
I'm shipping out next week.

22:17.564 --> 22:19.565
What do you mean?

22:19.599 --> 22:21.800
I'm reporting.

22:21.835 --> 22:23.769
He joined the army.

22:23.803 --> 22:26.171
Are you kidding?

22:26.205 --> 22:27.840
No.

22:27.874 --> 22:29.541
Are you fucking stupid?

22:29.575 --> 22:31.910
- Sally!
- I don't expect you to understand.

22:31.944 --> 22:34.746
- You hate the war.
- Not anymore.

22:34.780 --> 22:37.815
What about Kent State?
You were crying.

22:37.850 --> 22:39.617
You were gonna join
the movement.

22:39.652 --> 22:41.285
What about a bunch
of Negro kids dying

22:41.319 --> 22:43.755
while we just sit at home getting stoned?
It's immoral.

22:43.789 --> 22:44.989
Was this your idea?

22:45.024 --> 22:47.659
We just met.

22:47.693 --> 22:51.227
You're gonna die.
For what?

22:51.262 --> 22:53.229
Don't listen
to Jane Fonda here.

22:53.264 --> 22:55.365
It's a very brave thing to do.

22:57.134 --> 22:59.803
You know what?
Have fun at Playland.

22:59.837 --> 23:02.272
Just remember those kids
are the same age

23:02.306 --> 23:04.908
as the ones you're going
to be murdering in Vietnam.

23:04.943 --> 23:07.578
Sally, come on.

23:10.714 --> 23:12.715
I'm sorry.

23:12.749 --> 23:14.784
No.

23:14.818 --> 23:16.886
I expected it.

23:18.155 --> 23:21.391
Well, you've obviously grown
into a fine young man.

23:22.759 --> 23:24.260
Thank you, ma'am.

23:26.464 --> 23:28.998
Please don't let this
mar your afternoon.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.899
We'll see you
when you get back.

23:30.933 --> 23:32.901
Sally, too.

23:45.648 --> 23:48.883
Fourscore and seven years ago.

23:51.721 --> 23:55.056
We know where we've been,
we know where we are.

23:55.091 --> 23:57.325
Let's assume that it's good.

24:00.395 --> 24:03.131
But it's got to get better.

24:06.102 --> 24:08.802
It's supposed to get better.

24:10.005 --> 24:12.172
<i>Mr. Mathis needs to see you.</i>

24:12.206 --> 24:13.941
<i>I told him you were busy.</i>

24:16.044 --> 24:17.878
Send him in.

24:20.181 --> 24:22.116
Hello, Don.

24:22.150 --> 24:24.618
Just wanted to thank you
for fighting for me.

24:24.653 --> 24:26.219
Who told you that?

24:27.588 --> 24:29.556
Should we open it?

24:29.590 --> 24:31.324
I'm set.

24:31.359 --> 24:34.361
I appreciate
your confidence in me.

24:34.395 --> 24:36.363
What do you want?

24:36.397 --> 24:38.198
I want you to come
to the meeting.

24:38.232 --> 24:41.100
No.

24:41.135 --> 24:43.270
You have to make this
right yourself.

24:43.304 --> 24:45.138
How?

24:45.173 --> 24:47.374
I mean, do I apologize to them?

24:47.408 --> 24:48.874
Do I apologize to Ed?

24:48.908 --> 24:51.109
Do I slam my hand
in the door over and over?

24:51.144 --> 24:53.512
I once interrupted the client

24:53.547 --> 24:56.182
during a presentation for Lucky Strike,
our biggest account.

24:56.216 --> 24:57.516
What did you say?

24:57.551 --> 24:59.885
I wasn't supposed
to talk at all.

24:59.919 --> 25:02.588
I knew if I apologized, they'd
never want to work with me again.

25:02.622 --> 25:03.889
Why?

25:03.923 --> 25:06.158
Do I really
have to explain that?

25:06.193 --> 25:08.960
Not if you don't want to.

25:09.962 --> 25:11.429
So the next meeting
I walked in,

25:11.463 --> 25:13.131
shook Lee Garner's hand
and said,

25:13.166 --> 25:15.100
"I can't believe you have
the balls to come back

25:15.134 --> 25:17.069
after you embarrassed
yourself like that."

25:17.103 --> 25:19.270
Okay.

25:19.305 --> 25:21.573
I think I understand.

25:21.607 --> 25:24.409
I don't know.
Bring in a bar of soap.

25:24.443 --> 25:26.845
Tell them it's there in case you
need to wash your mouth out.

25:26.879 --> 25:28.346
Something like that.

25:28.380 --> 25:30.582
Thank you, Don.

25:41.924 --> 25:44.892
This was a big deal.
Four golf courses.

25:44.927 --> 25:47.227
Some with estates planned
on the perimeter.

25:47.262 --> 25:48.763
Palos Verdes.

25:48.797 --> 25:51.732
- Is that nice?
- Yes, dear.

25:51.767 --> 25:54.735
And all of a sudden, some
hippies come out of the wall

25:54.770 --> 25:58.338
yelling about low-income
housing, killing birds.

25:58.373 --> 26:00.074
Must be real radicals

26:00.108 --> 26:02.943
to prefer low-income
housing to a golf course.

26:02.977 --> 26:04.811
Come on, whose side are you on?

26:04.845 --> 26:07.113
I just root for the underdog.

26:08.415 --> 26:10.550
Well, let's see
how softhearted you are.

26:10.585 --> 26:11.751
How about a nightcap?

26:11.786 --> 26:13.987
That sounds nice.

26:21.361 --> 26:23.262
Where did you
tell him you were?

26:23.297 --> 26:25.331
Who?

26:25.365 --> 26:27.801
Tell me the truth.
Are you married?

26:29.470 --> 26:31.504
No.

26:31.538 --> 26:34.039
Please don't lie to me.

26:36.743 --> 26:38.711
I have a little boy.

26:40.414 --> 26:41.880
Oh.

26:41.915 --> 26:44.950
His name is Kevin
and he's four.

26:44.985 --> 26:48.053
Four?
That's a very little boy.

26:48.088 --> 26:50.956
Does that make a difference?

26:50.991 --> 26:52.992
No.

26:55.695 --> 26:57.463
Can I get the check?

27:04.638 --> 27:06.138
Yes, I'm fine.

27:06.172 --> 27:09.274
Um, when do you
expect him back?

27:12.612 --> 27:15.848
But I'm going out of town tomorrow
and I want to say good-bye.

27:20.720 --> 27:22.888
Yes.

27:27.460 --> 27:29.661
Just tell him I'm sorry

27:29.695 --> 27:32.930
and I want
to say good-bye.

27:32.965 --> 27:35.433
He has to call me.

27:39.038 --> 27:41.906
I'm sorry. I didn't
want to make you cry.

27:46.211 --> 27:48.345
Okay.

27:58.022 --> 28:00.291
What are you doing?

28:00.325 --> 28:02.326
I want your hands free.

28:10.668 --> 28:12.936
Do you mind
if I make a phone call?

28:12.970 --> 28:16.339
I should tell somebody
I'm going to be late.

28:18.976 --> 28:21.477
Can I offer you a brandy?

28:21.512 --> 28:23.180
Gin and tonic.

28:35.158 --> 28:37.193
May I have
an outside line, please?

28:37.228 --> 28:39.462
Look at this.
Ice.

28:39.496 --> 28:41.997
That's a good hotel.

28:51.141 --> 28:53.109
Harris residence.

28:53.143 --> 28:54.777
Hello, Maureen.
It's Joan.

28:54.811 --> 28:57.446
I wanted to see if you could
stay a few hours longer.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.681
I don't know.

28:59.716 --> 29:01.851
It's already
a quarter to 10:00.

29:01.885 --> 29:04.053
Well, what did
we say, 11:00?

29:04.087 --> 29:05.320
How about 1:00?

29:05.355 --> 29:06.988
I don't know.

29:07.022 --> 29:08.957
I kind of have someplace to be.

29:08.991 --> 29:12.727
Any chance in persuading you
to stay until midnight?

29:14.096 --> 29:16.731
Okay. You know, he had
trouble going to sleep.

29:16.766 --> 29:18.833
He said he was afraid
of a cow or something.

29:18.868 --> 29:21.335
It's a horse.
Is everything okay now?

29:21.370 --> 29:23.504
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I haven't heard anything.</i>

29:23.538 --> 29:25.106
I'll check on him.

29:25.141 --> 29:27.275
Wonderful.
Thanks so much.

29:30.912 --> 29:32.612
You need to go?

29:32.647 --> 29:35.315
No. We have
all the time we need.

29:35.349 --> 29:36.984
Or until midnight.

29:38.086 --> 29:39.686
I wasn't going
to spend the night

29:39.720 --> 29:41.755
under any circumstances.

29:41.790 --> 29:43.891
It's the kind of woman I am.

29:43.925 --> 29:46.326
A woman with a little kid.

29:49.230 --> 29:51.563
Would you rather I was married?

29:51.598 --> 29:53.966
Honey, give me a little bit
of credit for the fact that,

29:54.001 --> 29:57.870
well, I could have been a
cad and waited until after

29:57.905 --> 30:00.739
to tell you

30:00.774 --> 30:02.541
I don't like this.

30:03.643 --> 30:04.844
You don't like what?

30:04.878 --> 30:06.745
I love kids.

30:06.780 --> 30:10.482
But I raised mine
already and I'm--

30:10.517 --> 30:11.984
I know it sounds selfish.

30:12.019 --> 30:14.320
I mean, I'm done

30:14.354 --> 30:16.054
with that part of my life.

30:16.088 --> 30:18.824
You're being presumptuous.

30:18.858 --> 30:21.293
I know what this is
and so do you.

30:21.328 --> 30:23.028
Or you wouldn't have lied.

30:24.364 --> 30:26.665
I can't believe this.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.434
You're such a disappointment.

30:28.468 --> 30:30.902
This is not how I saw things.

30:30.937 --> 30:34.873
I have a plan
which is no plans.

30:34.907 --> 30:37.343
You can't go to the pyramids.
You can't go anywhere.

30:37.377 --> 30:39.711
You're right.

30:43.449 --> 30:44.983
Nice meeting you.

31:07.939 --> 31:09.340
<i>Miss Olson
would like to see you</i>

31:09.375 --> 31:11.942
- <i>when you have a moment.</i>
- Send her in.

31:18.316 --> 31:21.785
Ted told me I have to fill out
my own performance review.

31:21.819 --> 31:23.920
I guess he respects
your opinion.

31:23.954 --> 31:26.790
- I'm tired of this.
- I'd start with that.

31:26.824 --> 31:28.958
I'm serious.

31:28.993 --> 31:31.261
I want to have
my performance reviewed.

31:31.295 --> 31:33.196
I've had quite a year.

31:45.642 --> 31:47.377
What do you see for the future?

31:48.946 --> 31:50.780
Well, um...

31:50.814 --> 31:52.281
is that on there?

31:52.315 --> 31:54.082
No, I'm just curious.

31:56.452 --> 31:59.988
I'd like to be the first woman
creative director at this agency.

32:01.457 --> 32:02.991
That's funny to you?

32:03.026 --> 32:05.560
No, I'm impressed
that you know exactly.

32:05.594 --> 32:08.030
What else is there?

32:09.232 --> 32:11.433
That's what I'm asking.

32:11.467 --> 32:13.768
Let's say you get that.

32:13.803 --> 32:15.437
What's next?

32:17.740 --> 32:20.141
Land something huge.

32:21.410 --> 32:23.177
And then?

32:23.211 --> 32:26.915
Have a big idea.

32:26.949 --> 32:29.317
Create a catchphrase.

32:29.351 --> 32:31.719
So you want fame?

32:33.055 --> 32:34.722
Yes.

32:34.757 --> 32:37.124
What else?

32:38.928 --> 32:40.428
I don't know.

32:41.963 --> 32:43.730
Yes, you do.

32:47.234 --> 32:51.738
Create something
of lasting value.

32:53.775 --> 32:55.576
In advertising?

32:55.610 --> 32:59.012
This is supposed to be about my
job, not the meaning of life.

32:59.046 --> 33:01.381
So you think those things
are unrelated?

33:01.415 --> 33:02.883
I didn't know
you'd be in a mood.

33:02.917 --> 33:04.518
Do you want me
to do this or not?

33:04.552 --> 33:06.919
Why don't you just write down
all of your dreams

33:06.954 --> 33:08.721
so I can shit on them?

33:18.565 --> 33:21.267
Where the hell were you?

33:22.436 --> 33:24.904
Good morning to you, too.
I was at class.

33:24.938 --> 33:26.838
Why didn't you
mention that last night?

33:26.873 --> 33:28.507
Didn't Gail give you
my schedule?

33:28.541 --> 33:31.310
You and Gail are quite a team.

33:32.379 --> 33:34.113
She really needed a vacation.

33:34.147 --> 33:36.048
I think you need a vacation.

33:36.082 --> 33:39.218
You know what?
You're ruining my life.

33:41.087 --> 33:42.388
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

33:46.158 --> 33:48.159
Bye-bye, sweetie.

33:52.931 --> 33:54.598
Anyway, I think
you'll be impressed.

33:54.633 --> 33:57.068
If nothing else, by the speed with
which they turned this around.

33:57.102 --> 33:59.837
Well, nice to see you again.

34:01.306 --> 34:03.174
Can't believe you two have
the balls to walk back

34:03.208 --> 34:05.743
into this place after the way
you embarrassed yourselves.

34:20.107 --> 34:22.375
Did you go to the World's Fair?

34:22.409 --> 34:24.409
That's what I think
it's going to look like.

34:29.248 --> 34:30.750
What was your favorite part?

34:32.687 --> 34:34.219
Oh, good.
You're here.

34:34.254 --> 34:36.022
- Can I help you?
- Get out.

34:36.056 --> 34:37.422
What's going on?

34:37.456 --> 34:39.824
I tried your little saying
and I'm off the business.

34:39.859 --> 34:41.360
What are you talking about?

34:41.395 --> 34:44.730
I made your joke
and it failed miserably.

34:44.764 --> 34:46.666
- The soap thing?
- No!

34:46.699 --> 34:49.101
The one where I told them
they were assholes.

34:53.039 --> 34:54.840
You could have thought of
something yourself, you know.

34:54.873 --> 34:56.908
I did.
It was apologize.

34:56.942 --> 34:59.678
But you don't understand that because
guys like you don't have to do it.

34:59.712 --> 35:01.313
Guys like me know how to do it.

35:01.347 --> 35:03.348
Roger tells that
Lucky Strike story, too.

35:03.382 --> 35:07.485
But he says that Lee Garner Jr.
was in love with you.

35:07.520 --> 35:10.255
That you always had to be at the meetings
so he could think about jacking you off.

35:10.289 --> 35:12.557
You have a foul mouth.

35:12.592 --> 35:15.059
Take responsibility
for your failure.

35:15.094 --> 35:18.229
That account was handed to you and you made
nothing of it because you have no character.

35:18.263 --> 35:19.630
You don't have any character.

35:19.664 --> 35:21.765
You're just handsome.
Stop kidding yourself.

35:26.438 --> 35:28.138
Everybody has problems.

35:28.172 --> 35:30.374
Some people can deal with them
and some people can't.

35:30.408 --> 35:32.376
Look at yourself
because the next thing

35:32.410 --> 35:34.778
you're gonna have to move past
is losing this job.

35:34.812 --> 35:36.280
You're fired.

35:36.314 --> 35:39.382
I guess I kind of assumed that
when I walked in here.

35:39.416 --> 35:41.718
I just knew
I shouldn't apologize.

35:49.794 --> 35:52.629
- Is everything all right?
- Shut the door for me.

36:01.138 --> 36:03.072
<i>There's a Jim
McCloud here to see you.</i>

36:03.106 --> 36:04.974
<i>He's waiting in the lounge.</i>

36:16.153 --> 36:17.519
What are you doing here?

36:22.958 --> 36:24.559
Well, thank you so much.

36:24.594 --> 36:27.329
I'm a heel, okay?

36:29.799 --> 36:31.833
No, it's my fault.

36:31.867 --> 36:34.436
I thought about it and
I'm sending my son away.

36:34.470 --> 36:37.639
- What?
- No, I thought about what you said.

36:37.674 --> 36:40.240
And I like you, too.
And if I have to choose

36:40.275 --> 36:43.844
between you and my son,
I choose you.

36:43.878 --> 36:45.446
That's not what I said.

36:45.480 --> 36:47.782
That's exactly what you said.

36:47.816 --> 36:49.417
Well, I've thought about it

36:49.451 --> 36:51.519
and I want to be
a part of your life.

36:52.754 --> 36:55.222
And your little boy, too.

36:57.693 --> 36:59.827
I live with my mother.

36:59.861 --> 37:02.963
And I've been divorced twice.

37:02.997 --> 37:05.799
I'm buying some property
in New York.

37:05.834 --> 37:07.434
Where do you live?

37:07.468 --> 37:09.870
12th Street.

37:09.904 --> 37:13.373
Okay, I'm not gonna
buy property down there.

37:13.407 --> 37:15.709
But...

37:15.743 --> 37:17.577
I'm gonna get a place
in a nice neighborhood

37:17.611 --> 37:19.812
near the park
and you're gonna visit.

37:19.847 --> 37:21.647
All of you.

37:21.681 --> 37:24.150
We'll see.

37:24.184 --> 37:26.652
I don't want to be rigid.

37:26.686 --> 37:28.687
It makes you old.

37:32.226 --> 37:34.560
Can I call you?

37:34.594 --> 37:36.262
Okay.

37:43.470 --> 37:45.337
<i>I got it.</i>

37:55.482 --> 37:57.449
Hello.

37:59.918 --> 38:02.152
Oh, hello.

38:02.187 --> 38:04.422
Loretta let me in
on her way out.

38:04.456 --> 38:06.357
I didn't want to surprise you.

38:07.925 --> 38:10.193
No, that's fine.

38:10.227 --> 38:12.228
You know Sally's not here.

38:12.263 --> 38:14.431
I know.

38:16.467 --> 38:18.167
Can I get something to drink?

38:18.202 --> 38:20.504
Of course.

38:20.538 --> 38:22.205
What do you have in mind?

38:22.239 --> 38:24.541
How about that beer?

38:34.818 --> 38:36.552
Do you want to sit down?

38:36.586 --> 38:38.221
No.

38:45.396 --> 38:47.263
They have beer over there.

38:48.898 --> 38:51.066
From what I read
in the magazines,

38:51.100 --> 38:52.968
they have all
the comforts of home.

38:55.338 --> 38:58.340
Sally's mad.
My mother's mad.

38:58.374 --> 38:59.975
But you're not.

39:01.077 --> 39:03.245
They're afraid for you.

39:03.279 --> 39:05.647
I am, too, honestly.

39:05.681 --> 39:08.050
But you understand
why I'm doing it.

39:08.084 --> 39:10.751
Do you want me
to say that I like it?

39:10.785 --> 39:14.355
I know you do because I'm
brave and I love this country

39:14.389 --> 39:17.291
and I want to protect it
and everyone in it.

39:17.326 --> 39:19.226
Glen.

39:22.597 --> 39:24.765
I know something
could happen to me.

39:24.799 --> 39:27.435
But I feel safe
because I know you're mine.

39:30.171 --> 39:32.305
Glen, stop.

39:35.309 --> 39:37.077
Why?

39:38.680 --> 39:40.481
Because I'm married.

39:48.990 --> 39:50.958
I'm sorry.

39:53.027 --> 39:54.827
It's okay.

39:54.862 --> 39:56.429
I understand.

39:56.464 --> 39:58.431
You don't.

39:58.466 --> 40:00.967
Well, I don't know
what I'm supposed to say.

40:01.002 --> 40:03.603
This was gonna be the good thing
that came out of all this.

40:03.637 --> 40:05.105
This is all I thought about.

40:05.139 --> 40:06.739
Glen.

40:06.773 --> 40:08.674
I know you know me.

40:08.709 --> 40:10.743
I know you know
the man I can be.

40:12.546 --> 40:17.182
Glen, please don't tell me
that you did this for me.

40:17.217 --> 40:19.385
I couldn't live with myself.

40:21.121 --> 40:23.389
It's so much worse.

40:24.791 --> 40:26.458
What?

40:28.128 --> 40:30.062
I flunked out.

40:30.096 --> 40:32.197
Oh, no.

40:33.365 --> 40:35.366
My stepdad knew
I was doing bad.

40:35.401 --> 40:38.436
He was gonna kill me.
Kick me out.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.772
After I told him,

40:40.806 --> 40:43.307
he was so proud.

40:43.342 --> 40:45.644
Everything was
peaches and cream.

41:12.537 --> 41:15.237
You're going to make it.

41:15.272 --> 41:16.773
I'm positive.

41:35.317 --> 41:37.518
Don't let me fill up on these.

41:37.553 --> 41:40.688
The bus leaves at 8:30.
Will the food come in time?

41:40.723 --> 41:42.590
They must have run
out of stray cats.

41:43.759 --> 41:45.393
You're so funny.

41:45.427 --> 41:47.194
He always says that.

41:47.229 --> 41:49.029
It's still funny.

41:49.064 --> 41:50.697
What place are you
most excited about?

41:50.732 --> 41:54.268
Washington DC. We're going
to the floor of the Senate.

41:54.302 --> 41:55.602
To protest?

41:55.636 --> 41:58.638
No, we're getting a tour
from Senator Dodd.

41:58.673 --> 42:01.541
We're going to find
an office for Carol.

42:01.576 --> 42:02.809
You want to work there one day?

42:02.844 --> 42:04.711
I want to be a senator.

42:04.746 --> 42:07.481
That's impressive.
Good for you.

42:07.515 --> 42:09.449
I don't know what I want to be.

42:09.484 --> 42:11.885
You'll figure it out.
What are your interests?

42:13.087 --> 42:15.321
I guess I just want
to live in New York.

42:15.356 --> 42:17.790
I want to be
a translator at the UN.

42:17.824 --> 42:19.759
Yolanda's father is a diplomat.

42:19.793 --> 42:23.062
I'm so tired of people
asking me what I want to do.

42:23.097 --> 42:25.498
Well, if you're lucky
enough to think of it,

42:25.532 --> 42:27.066
you should write it down.

42:27.101 --> 42:28.868
Because when you get older,
you're gonna forget.

42:30.704 --> 42:32.872
Did you write down advertising?

42:32.907 --> 42:35.341
I didn't know
what advertising was.

42:35.376 --> 42:37.376
But I wanted to be
in New York City, too.

42:39.412 --> 42:42.480
So, where do you live, Don?

42:42.515 --> 42:45.150
Where do I live?
The Upper East Side.

42:47.153 --> 42:48.620
In a penthouse?

42:48.654 --> 42:50.655
As a matter of fact, yes.

42:51.891 --> 42:54.192
But he grew up very poor.

42:54.227 --> 42:56.728
And now you have a penthouse.

42:58.298 --> 43:00.399
- May I?
- Sure.

43:02.334 --> 43:03.902
When I watch television,

43:03.936 --> 43:06.003
the commercials
are my favorite part.

43:12.511 --> 43:15.179
So what do you want to do?

43:15.213 --> 43:17.515
I just want to eat dinner.

43:19.652 --> 43:21.419
Nothing like having
realistic goals.

43:30.996 --> 43:33.364
- Good-bye, Mr. Draper.
- Bye.

43:33.398 --> 43:35.232
Thanks for dinner.

43:37.035 --> 43:38.836
Sally.

43:38.870 --> 43:41.171
- I'll wave from the bus.
- Hold on a second.

43:44.609 --> 43:46.577
It's okay to be nervous
about going away.

43:46.611 --> 43:49.580
You can't control
yourself, can you?

43:49.614 --> 43:51.247
What are you talking about?

43:51.282 --> 43:53.584
Sarah is 17, you know.

43:54.986 --> 43:56.353
I'm well aware of that, Sally.

43:56.387 --> 43:58.589
But it doesn't stop you.

43:58.623 --> 44:00.823
And it doesn't stop Mom.

44:02.093 --> 44:04.294
Anyone pays attention
to either of you,

44:04.328 --> 44:06.529
and they always do,

44:06.563 --> 44:09.265
and you just ooze everywhere.

44:09.300 --> 44:11.401
Your friend's
a fast girl, Sally.

44:11.435 --> 44:12.902
I didn't want to embarrass her.

44:12.936 --> 44:16.072
You know what I'm gonna
write down for my dream?

44:16.107 --> 44:19.842
I want to get on the bus and
get away from you and Mom

44:19.877 --> 44:22.979
and hopefully be a different
person than you two.

44:23.014 --> 44:25.014
Hey.

44:25.048 --> 44:27.149
I'm your father.

44:27.183 --> 44:29.886
And you may not want
to listen to this,

44:29.920 --> 44:32.121
but you are like
your mother and me.

44:32.155 --> 44:33.823
You're gonna find that out.

44:35.859 --> 44:38.027
You're a very beautiful girl.

44:39.429 --> 44:41.330
It's up to you
to be more than that.

45:09.992 --> 45:12.593
Bobby, Gene, get back here.

45:13.628 --> 45:15.328
It's time for bed.

45:15.363 --> 45:18.065
I want to watch
"The Brady Bunch."

45:19.534 --> 45:21.234
Fine.

45:21.269 --> 45:23.270
Give me that.

45:44.525 --> 45:45.992
Hello?

45:46.026 --> 45:48.361
Oh, um...

45:48.396 --> 45:50.297
This will just take a minute.

45:56.003 --> 45:58.104
It's done.
I did it.

45:58.138 --> 46:00.339
I don't know how,
but they're signing.

46:00.373 --> 46:02.075
Right now?

46:02.109 --> 46:04.510
Asking price.
30-day escrow.

46:04.544 --> 46:06.512
Really?

46:06.546 --> 46:08.915
Now we have to find
a place for you.
