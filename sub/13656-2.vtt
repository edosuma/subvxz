00:36.614 --> 00:39.367
<b>1x02 - Before and After</b>

01:12.039 --> 01:15.408
He's all yours.
Good luck.

01:16.778 --> 01:19.879
God, this is a crappy
way to make a living.

01:19.913 --> 01:24.117
Dealing with the worst the world
has to offer without being in charge.

01:24.151 --> 01:27.854
- You weren't in charge for eight years.
- Yeah, but now I'm mad about it.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.323
Lieutenants, the
victim is a personal trainer

01:30.357 --> 01:32.458
who owns this gym, Chad Raber.

01:32.493 --> 01:36.095
His first client showed up
and found him hanging there.

01:36.130 --> 01:38.398
What do you know?
A hanging Chad.

01:39.467 --> 01:43.136
Scented candle over there?
It's been burning a couple hours,

01:43.170 --> 01:44.771
so Mr. Raber was
definitely here before 6:00.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.472
No obvious sign of forced entry.

01:46.507 --> 01:49.308
the gravity boots suggest he was
working his abs when he bought it.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.878
- Our murder weapon is this kettlebell.
- Yes, I see it.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.112
I mean, if you haven't
been to the gym recently,

01:53.147 --> 01:55.848
you wouldn't even know what it is,
but it only weighs 15 pounds,

01:55.883 --> 01:57.517
which means we can't
rule out our client/P.R.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.152
because she would have
gotten a really good ...

01:59.186 --> 02:01.754
Sykes. Sykes.
You've got the job.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.823
You can temper
the enthusiasm just a little.

02:05.092 --> 02:09.262
Why don't you just go, you know,
track down the next of kin, please?

02:09.295 --> 02:12.065
Okay.

02:12.099 --> 02:14.400
And you two cover up the
body and take it down.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.269
<i>This is, um, this is just
all too much, you know?</i>

02:16.303 --> 02:17.937
I can't handle the stress.

02:17.971 --> 02:21.040
Ugh, and my therapist is
on a bike tour in Napa.

02:21.042 --> 02:23.176
- Okay, Ms. Shaw.
- Call me Dee Dee.

02:23.210 --> 02:26.312
All right. Once again, tell us
what you told the other Detective.

02:26.346 --> 02:30.483
Okay. I got here at 6:30
with a latte for myself

02:30.517 --> 02:35.221
and one for Chad,
and there he was, just... hanging there.

02:35.255 --> 02:38.324
- He was your personal trainer.
- And my wellness partner.

02:38.358 --> 02:40.159
You should have seen me 20 pounds ago.

02:40.194 --> 02:42.962
- You could throw up.
- Well, Dee Dee,

02:42.996 --> 02:45.431
um, given what happened to his face,

02:45.466 --> 02:47.467
how could you be certain
that the victim was Chad?

02:47.501 --> 02:50.369
His tattoo.
"Body soul self."

02:50.404 --> 02:52.138
That was Chad's motto.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.909
- What the hell was that?
- The victim's wife is here.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.111
- Chad!
- Now?!

02:59.813 --> 03:02.081
- No, no, no! Please let go!
- Watch it. Watch it.

03:02.116 --> 03:03.116
Chad!

03:05.152 --> 03:06.018
Oh!

03:07.754 --> 03:10.389
Who in the hell invited
the wife to the crime scene?

03:10.424 --> 03:13.059
Uh, she was on her way over,
and you said to notify the family.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.927
I said, "go."

03:14.962 --> 03:18.131
"Go notify the family."
"Go," as in leave here and...

03:18.165 --> 03:20.833
- Chad!
- Never mind. Never mind.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.202
Get that screaming woman downtown.

03:23.237 --> 03:26.739
And you, remove this
Dee Dee person from my sight.

03:26.773 --> 03:30.476
- Yes, sir.
- Where's my cellphone?

03:30.511 --> 03:32.411
Gentlemen. Ugh.

03:32.446 --> 03:35.748
So, this murder is
a major crime because...?

03:35.782 --> 03:40.520
- Because we're west of the 405?
- DDA hobbs, what can I do for you?

03:40.554 --> 03:43.156
I don't know. Our bosses want me here.

03:43.190 --> 03:45.158
speaking of, where's Raydor?

03:45.192 --> 03:48.127
Excellent question.
Just hold on one second.

03:48.162 --> 03:51.497
For the love of god, Julio!
Throw a blanket over the body.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.399
I ... I can't look at it anymore.

03:53.433 --> 03:58.404
Ah, Captain. Good morning.
I hope I didn't call you at a bad time.

03:58.438 --> 04:03.276
- Your division caught a homicide.
- Yes, Lieutenant, I am aware,

04:03.310 --> 04:06.345
but I am in the middle of something
involving our material witness.

04:06.380 --> 04:09.115
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, well, that ...</i>

04:09.149 --> 04:10.816
We've got a guy whose
head has been bashed in.

04:10.851 --> 04:14.253
I see. Did he die from the brain
injuries or did he bleed out?

04:14.288 --> 04:15.922
<i>It's undetermined.</i>

04:15.956 --> 04:18.357
- Is the head still attached?
-Well, more or less.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.860
You see, this is no
environment for a child.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.950
Mm-hmm. These your clothes?

04:22.985 --> 04:26.098
No. She makes me keep all
of my things in trash bags.

04:26.133 --> 04:29.068
That is not true.
I have two grown children,

04:29.102 --> 04:31.470
<i>and they leave these things
here for when they visit,</i>

04:31.505 --> 04:33.839
and the suit belongs to my husband,

04:33.874 --> 04:36.142
and i've asked Rusty to bring
his things in here, but he won't.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.476
Your husband's not listed

04:37.511 --> 04:39.879
in the application for
emergency foster care.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.214
Wait. Somebody married you?

04:41.248 --> 04:45.151
<i>My husband and I have been
legally separated for two decades.</i>

04:45.185 --> 04:48.387
My husband does not
live here, I assure you.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.423
<i>Uh, Captain.</i>

04:50.457 --> 04:53.826
As riveting as your life story is,

04:53.860 --> 04:56.429
um, are you going to
grace us with your presence

04:56.463 --> 04:58.130
<i>at the crime scene?</i>

04:58.165 --> 05:01.067
Uh, could you please
excuse me for a moment?

05:01.101 --> 05:04.704
I'm sorry, Lieutenant. Are
you suddenly in over your head?

05:04.738 --> 05:06.439
<i>Do you see how bossy she is?</i>

05:06.473 --> 05:11.244
Look, I place kids all over town.
You got a pretty nice setup here, Rusty.

05:11.278 --> 05:15.381
- Clean, quiet, you got your own room, cable, DVR.
- It's not my room.

05:15.415 --> 05:17.083
- It's not my room.
- I wouldn't mind living here myself.

05:17.117 --> 05:20.052
You better not blow this. Seriously.

05:20.087 --> 05:25.091
- Sorry. Cynthia, where were we?
- Just finishing up, Captain.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.460
And from what I can tell,
Rusty is in good hands here,

05:27.494 --> 05:29.362
and DCFS is very grateful to you.

05:29.396 --> 05:32.999
No, you are happy to lock me up
until I testify in your stupid murder trial,

05:33.033 --> 05:35.401
which is why nobody is
bothering to look for my mom.

05:35.435 --> 05:36.769
Rusty.

05:36.803 --> 05:39.872
You know, the first chance I get,
I'm going to leave and find her myself.

05:39.906 --> 05:43.009
Would you rather I spend my time
looking for your mother or you?

05:43.043 --> 05:44.510
He's not going anywhere this week

05:44.544 --> 05:47.013
because technically Rusty
is in emergency care.

05:47.047 --> 05:50.283
What do you plan to do with
him while you're at work?

05:52.219 --> 05:55.121
Mr. Raber definitely
did not see this coming.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.890
No defensive wounds
on his hands or arMs.

05:57.924 --> 06:00.459
- Is it possible he knew his attacker?
- Or maybe someone snuck up on him.

06:00.494 --> 06:05.364
I count three reps, so your killer
definitely got a decent workout.

06:05.399 --> 06:08.801
Maybe you should look for someone
with a good burn in their forearMs.

06:08.835 --> 06:10.369
Hmm?

06:13.740 --> 06:17.243
Well, all right.
Ta-ta, everyone.

06:17.277 --> 06:20.980
- Uh, ta-ta. Buzz.
- Yes, Captain?

06:21.014 --> 06:23.316
Would you set Rusty up with
a laptop in the break room?

06:23.350 --> 06:26.319
There's a school placement test,
and he needs to study for it.

06:26.353 --> 06:27.953
Yes, ma'am.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.789
Oh, and, uh, would you monitor
him while he's in there?

06:30.490 --> 06:33.793
M-monitor?
A-as in sit with him?

06:33.827 --> 06:35.294
Yes. Thank you.

06:35.329 --> 06:38.130
Uh, is there anything else we
should know about the victim?

06:38.165 --> 06:39.999
I'm on hanging Chad's website.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.068
Looks like most of
his clients are women.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.870
There's a page of
before-and-after shots.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.806
- Pretty racy.
- Yeah.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.108
Here's a woman who claims
he helped her lose 58 pounds,

06:49.142 --> 06:50.743
but the diet is a little extreme.

06:50.777 --> 06:52.178
All right, Sykes.

06:52.212 --> 06:55.114
I need a full background
report on Chad Raber.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.916
Find out what we're up against here.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.955
- Sykes!
- Yes, sir.

07:02.989 --> 07:06.425
Lieutenant.
Captain.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.761
The victim's wife is
set up in interview 1.

07:11.365 --> 07:14.333
Lieutenant Flynn, will
you join me, please?

07:14.368 --> 07:16.001
Yeah. Sure.

07:22.275 --> 07:26.145
Okay.
It's not just me. You can tell.

07:26.179 --> 07:29.181
- Everybody hates her.
- This way, Mr. Beck, if you don't mind.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.217
Lieutenant Tao, could you watch
the monitors for me, please?

07:31.251 --> 07:32.785
Julio.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.188
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

07:36.223 --> 07:38.724
Nothing seems real right now.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.359
We understand.
Believe me, we do.

07:40.394 --> 07:42.828
<i>And we're gonna find
out who's responsible</i>

07:42.863 --> 07:44.730
<i>for your husband's murder, okay?</i>

07:44.765 --> 07:47.266
<i>We're very sorry for your loss.</i>

07:47.300 --> 07:49.902
<i>Why would somebody do this?</i>

07:49.936 --> 07:51.871
<i>Why? God.</i>

07:51.905 --> 07:54.340
<i>Mrs. Raber, did your husband
keep a lot of cash at the gym?</i>

07:54.374 --> 07:56.876
<i>No. No.</i>

07:56.910 --> 07:59.345
Um, we dealt with
really high-end clients.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.814
They paid with credit cards and checks.

08:01.848 --> 08:04.417
The safe was mainly for
just business papers.

08:04.451 --> 08:07.319
Well, it doesn't look
like they touched the safe.

08:07.354 --> 08:11.957
- How about computers?
- No, I handled all the bills from home.

08:11.992 --> 08:16.028
Chad was always on the move,
so he put all of his ...

08:16.062 --> 08:17.963
he put all of his work
in his IPad and his phone.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.332
We didn't find either of those.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.802
<i>Well, he takes them everywhere.</i>

08:22.836 --> 08:25.905
Then I can find them 'cause
he's hooked up to a network.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.907
<i>How's Chad been feeling recently?</i>

08:27.941 --> 08:29.775
Has he mentioned any
difficulties at work?

08:31.812 --> 08:33.212
Oh.

08:33.246 --> 08:36.849
- What's Sykes doing in there?
- I thought S.I.S. officers

08:36.883 --> 08:39.919
were supposed to be good
at sneaking up on people.

08:39.953 --> 08:43.155
What? Ooh!
Outside?

08:43.190 --> 08:44.323
I don't know what's so
important it couldn't wait.

08:44.357 --> 08:48.327
- Chad was a suspect in a rape.
- Sykes!

08:49.262 --> 08:51.263
<i>My husband was not a rapist!</i>

08:51.298 --> 08:52.932
That's not good.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.266
<i>That's a lie! That's a ...
that's a lie!</i>

08:54.301 --> 08:55.935
Hang on, okay? Just hang on.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.770
The woman who made that
accusation against Chad

08:57.804 --> 08:58.971
was one of his crazy clients.

08:59.005 --> 09:00.272
- Excuse us.
- You knew her?

09:00.307 --> 09:02.842
<i>Yes, she was always
hitting on him at the gym.</i>

09:02.876 --> 09:05.678
All right, I found
a month-old criminal complaint

09:05.712 --> 09:08.047
- against Chad Raber.
- Detective, we like to plan

09:08.081 --> 09:10.683
how we share important
information like that.

09:10.717 --> 09:14.053
I am so sorry. My orders
were to make sure ...

09:14.087 --> 09:15.087
Were given by me.

09:16.890 --> 09:20.826
And I was the person
that you were supposed to report to.

09:20.861 --> 09:24.396
Go help Lieutenant Tao figure
out how to find our victim's IPad.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.068
I am so sorry, again.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.841
She's smart and dumb at the same time.

09:35.876 --> 09:41.847
Oh, she's not dumb.
She's choosing sides.

09:48.854 --> 09:51.394
<i>So maybe
Detective Sykes' announcement </i>

09:51.395 --> 09:53.262
was ill-timed, but it gave you a lead.

09:53.297 --> 09:56.866
She was following an order,
actually, from Lieutenant Provenza,

09:56.900 --> 10:00.136
who was angry with her
for reporting directly to me.

10:00.170 --> 10:02.138
Provenza will calm down once he accepts

10:02.172 --> 10:05.174
he was never going to run Major Crimes.
We'll wait him out.

10:05.208 --> 10:09.845
I think, sir, one of the things
confusing the issue here is rank.

10:09.880 --> 10:13.049
You and Chief Pope did
promise to make me Commander.

10:14.885 --> 10:19.255
You do realize that there's
a freeze on all promotions.

10:19.289 --> 10:21.257
Except apparently on Assistant Chief.

10:22.926 --> 10:28.197
You've had a great, long career ...
in internal affairs.

10:28.231 --> 10:31.167
And now you are being given
this unique opportunity,

10:31.201 --> 10:34.337
one that every Captain in this
department would leap at ...

10:34.371 --> 10:40.042
To run the most elite division
of Detectives in the L.A.P.D.

10:40.077 --> 10:44.280
The job is the promotion.
And it's a gift ...

10:44.314 --> 10:47.917
one that usually
doesn't happen for people

10:47.951 --> 10:50.486
after they've qualified for retirement.

10:50.520 --> 10:53.289
So, considering how many
people would like to replace me

10:53.323 --> 10:56.892
and how old I am, I should just
take this job and be grateful.

10:56.927 --> 11:00.963
- Is that what you're saying?
- The ability to hold your team together

11:00.997 --> 11:04.433
should be a function of your
leadership, not your rank.

11:04.468 --> 11:08.738
Effectively concluding this
case will demonstrate both

11:08.739 --> 11:13.008
your capacity to command
and your fitness for the job.

11:13.343 --> 11:17.279
Now, is there anything
else I ought to know?

11:20.150 --> 11:22.918
Anything?

11:22.953 --> 11:26.322
According to Detective
Copeland, west Los Angeles,

11:26.356 --> 11:29.291
the alleged victim's father,
Jim Martino,

11:29.326 --> 11:31.494
came in last month to file rape charges

11:31.528 --> 11:33.867
against Chad Raber on
his daughter's behalf.

11:33.926 --> 11:35.739
She wouldn't come in herself?

11:35.863 --> 11:38.934
Her Dad said that she was too
terrif file, and he got angry, too,

11:38.969 --> 11:41.270
because there was nothing that
we could do without her statement.

11:41.304 --> 11:45.374
He said, "that son of a bitch ruined
our lives, and I'm gonna ruin his."

11:45.409 --> 11:48.010
Motive and confession equals murder one.

11:48.044 --> 11:50.012
A father kills the man
who raped his daughter?

11:50.046 --> 11:52.148
That sounds like mitigating
circumstances to me.

11:52.182 --> 11:55.151
Juries don't feel much
sympathy for rapists.

11:55.185 --> 11:58.521
I might get manslaughter.
What about physical evidence?

11:58.555 --> 12:01.123
Did you find any fingerprints
on the handle of the kettlebell?

12:01.158 --> 12:02.925
No, but I've asked

12:02.959 --> 12:04.860
to have the rest of the
equipment in the gym processed,

12:04.895 --> 12:08.130
- so when it's time to make a deal ...
- Hold on. Just hold on here.

12:08.165 --> 12:12.134
Let's make sure we've got the right
guy before you offer him a deal.

12:12.169 --> 12:16.172
While Tao and Sykes are
looking for Chad Raber's IPad,

12:16.206 --> 12:21.110
Flynn, Sanchez, let's split up and pay
Mr. Martino and his daughter a visit.

12:22.212 --> 12:24.413
Come on.
We're getting close.

12:25.511 --> 12:27.550
Hey, how come Lieutenant
Provenza doesn't like me?

12:27.584 --> 12:29.885
Provenza doesn't like
anybody. Turn right here.

12:32.889 --> 12:34.457
Whoa!

12:38.094 --> 12:40.463
Any, uh, tips on getting along with him?

12:40.497 --> 12:43.049
Uh, if I were you, I'd
concentrate more on how you feel

12:43.050 --> 12:46.602
about the victim and less on how
people feel about you. Just saying.

12:46.636 --> 12:51.273
- That's very wise.
- Really?

12:53.176 --> 12:57.413
Uh, just make the next right.
Please slow down.

13:07.190 --> 13:09.825
Afternoon, ma'am.
Detective Julio Sanchez, L.A.P.D.

13:09.860 --> 13:14.497
- I'm looking for Mr. Jim Martino.
- Uh, he's not here.

13:14.531 --> 13:16.365
Are you his daughter, Amanda?

13:17.267 --> 13:19.368
- Please. I just want to talk.
- No, I have nothing to say.

13:19.402 --> 13:22.905
- It's about Chad Raber.
- No! No, he will kill me.

13:22.939 --> 13:24.840
No, ma'am, he won't.
Chad is dead.

13:30.347 --> 13:32.448
<i> Really? Did he suffer?</i>

13:32.482 --> 13:33.949
Son of a bitch.

13:33.984 --> 13:35.251
You know what he did to
my daughter, don't you?

13:35.285 --> 13:36.886
That's why we're here.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.521
Follow up on the complaint
you filed against Mr. Raber.

13:38.555 --> 13:42.858
Follow up, right? After he's
been found dead, you follow up.

13:42.893 --> 13:45.227
You guys are right on
top of things, aren't you?

13:45.262 --> 13:48.364
What happened? A month ago, you
wouldn't come near this case.

13:48.398 --> 13:50.866
- Did that tick you off?
- Do you have a daughter?

13:50.901 --> 13:52.401
I wanted to make a banner

13:52.435 --> 13:56.639
that said "Chad Raber is a rapist"
and hang it in front of his gym.

13:56.673 --> 14:00.509
But Amanda wouldn't let me.
So I thought I'd sue his ass.

14:00.544 --> 14:02.278
I went over to their gym
to warn him and his wife

14:02.312 --> 14:03.479
to expect a call from my attorney.

14:05.115 --> 14:06.549
Guess I just saved a few
thousand in legal fees, huh?

14:06.583 --> 14:10.085
- Hey. What are you guys doing here?
- We found something

14:10.120 --> 14:12.187
in the dumpster behind
Mr. Martino's business.

14:13.924 --> 14:17.993
Any idea, sir, why a murder
victim's IPad was in your trash?

14:20.196 --> 14:21.630
That's a fascinating question.

14:23.266 --> 14:27.970
- And the answer is?
- The entire mini mall uses that dumpster.

14:28.004 --> 14:31.340
- I didn't put it there.
- Of course you didn't.

14:31.374 --> 14:33.509
It was left there by the
kids from the doughnut shop.

14:33.543 --> 14:36.245
We want to introduce you to
some people downtown. Let's go.

14:38.014 --> 14:39.848
<i>My name is Amanda Martino,</i>

14:39.883 --> 14:43.452
<i>and I would just like to say</i>

14:43.486 --> 14:50.392
<i>that Chad Raber is the best personal
trainer anyone could ever have.</i>

14:51.427 --> 14:53.395
<i>Because of you, Chad,
I'm 118 pounds ...</i>

14:53.430 --> 14:55.397
Stop. Please turn it off.

14:58.435 --> 15:02.004
Amanda, we found this
video on Chad Raber's IPad.

15:02.038 --> 15:04.873
Chad made me say those things.

15:04.908 --> 15:07.977
<i>You can almost hear him
telling me what to say.</i>

15:08.011 --> 15:10.112
<i>I know how difficut this is for you,</i>

15:10.146 --> 15:13.482
<i>and I would never ask you to
talk about something so awful</i>

15:13.516 --> 15:18.520
<i>if it weren't absolutely necessary
for us to get justice</i>

15:18.555 --> 15:19.588
for you and your Dad.

15:25.862 --> 15:31.367
Six months ago, Dad bought
me sessions with a trainer

15:31.401 --> 15:36.505
<i>as kind of an early
college-graduation present.</i>

15:36.539 --> 15:39.074
I've always hated the way that I looked.

15:39.109 --> 15:43.479
But Chad was so sweet about it.
He took my picture,

15:43.513 --> 15:47.883
and he just told me to say
"so long" to that body.

15:50.420 --> 15:51.887
That would be this photograph?

15:53.623 --> 15:56.291
That's it.
That's my "before" picture.

15:56.326 --> 15:59.828
Don't I look so much better now?

15:59.863 --> 16:03.435
One day, we were .

16:03.526 --> 16:07.269
<i>by ourselves at his gym.
I was on my back doing sit-ups</i>

16:07.303 --> 16:12.529
<i>and he he just
climbed on top of me.</i>

16:12.564 --> 16:16.211
I didn't know what to do.
I ... I ... he wouldn't stop,

16:16.246 --> 16:19.248
and I just told him
to stop, please stop.

16:19.282 --> 16:20.582
He wouldn't stop.

16:26.122 --> 16:27.423
<i>And, uh...</i>

16:27.457 --> 16:32.161
After that, he said
that I should be happy,

16:32.195 --> 16:37.099
that what he did meant
that I was finally ready for him.

16:37.133 --> 16:39.168
"Ready for him?"

16:39.202 --> 16:44.939
Like, he got me into shape
so that I would be doable.

16:45.608 --> 16:48.110
And then he forced
me to make that video.

16:48.144 --> 16:52.047
I-I-I felt that no one
would ever believe me.

16:52.082 --> 16:54.149
Your father believed you.

16:55.952 --> 16:57.252
And he went to the police.

16:57.287 --> 17:01.457
- He was so mad.
- How mad?

17:01.491 --> 17:04.356
My Detectives found

17:04.430 --> 17:07.796
<i>Chad Raber's IPad
outside your father's print shop.</i>

17:07.830 --> 17:12.185
<i>No. No, that ...
that can't be right.</i>

17:12.221 --> 17:14.936
Can you account for your
and your father's

17:14.971 --> 17:16.271
whereabouts early this morning?

17:16.306 --> 17:20.108
I was ...
we were at home.

17:20.143 --> 17:22.077
<i>You know, at my Dad's house.</i>

17:22.112 --> 17:25.230
An alibi for each of them?
How convenient.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.415
She's covering for her old man.

17:28.852 --> 17:31.353
She's been covering for
all the men in her life.

17:31.387 --> 17:33.422
- I know that girl.
- How did you meet her?

17:33.456 --> 17:35.858
I mean the type.
Amanda has low self-esteem.

17:35.892 --> 17:37.960
She's impressionable,
easy to manipulate,

17:37.994 --> 17:40.362
and women tell their
personal trainers everything.

17:40.396 --> 17:42.364
Like, "I'm single.
I don't have a boyfriend.

17:42.398 --> 17:44.900
I don't know what to eat.
I don't know what to wear."

17:44.934 --> 17:48.137
Chad Raber was probably hunting
for someone like this girl.

17:48.171 --> 17:49.505
You think she was the only one?

17:49.539 --> 17:52.441
There's a lot of before-and-after
pictures on that website.

17:52.475 --> 17:53.375
There might be
before-and-after videos, too.

17:53.409 --> 17:55.734
Hold on. Hold on.
Wait a second.

17:55.821 --> 17:57.880
What?
That mean something to you?

17:57.914 --> 18:00.816
There's one video on the device,
but there may be more on the network.

18:03.486 --> 18:05.020
- Can I come in yet?
- No.

18:05.054 --> 18:06.822
I told you to stay at
my desk until I'm done,

18:06.856 --> 18:08.257
- and then I'll look over your exam ...
- Hey. "No" is enough.

18:08.291 --> 18:10.859
It's not like I'm desperate
to spend time with you.

18:13.096 --> 18:16.231
Ah. Gotcha.
Here we go.

18:17.267 --> 18:19.334
<i>Hey, Chad. It's me.</i>

18:19.369 --> 18:24.072
<i>Thanks for the workout. I
really needed that. I feel ...</i>

18:24.107 --> 18:25.541
Here's another one.

18:25.575 --> 18:27.810
<i>Chad, you are ...</i>

18:27.844 --> 18:29.278
<i>- Amazing.
- Amazing.</i>

18:29.312 --> 18:31.213
<i>I can't tell you ...</i>

18:31.247 --> 18:33.048
Ugh. And another.

18:33.082 --> 18:35.417
<i>Thanks for everything, Chad.</i>

18:35.451 --> 18:38.253
<i>I don't know what I
would do without you.</i>

18:38.288 --> 18:41.390
All these videos were on
Raber's IPad the whole time?

18:41.424 --> 18:45.027
No, they were recently deleted,
but backed up on a remote server.

18:45.061 --> 18:49.148
Someone removed the videos
at 8:40 a.m. after hanging

18:49.149 --> 18:53.235
Chad's murder, but they didn't
delete them from the cloud.

18:53.269 --> 18:56.872
- How many videos did you find?
- Including Amanda's, nine.

18:56.906 --> 18:58.273
Each one of these girls

18:58.308 --> 19:00.442
represents lots of credible
alternatives to Martino.

19:00.476 --> 19:03.912
The Captain's not gonna
be able to make a deal.

19:03.947 --> 19:08.083
Well, that's her problem.
Not ours.

19:12.999 --> 19:15.281
No, Lieutant Provenzo's rules
of evidence compel us,

19:15.352 --> 19:19.486
to talk to each woman that the
victim filmed, get their alibis,

19:19.597 --> 19:22.635
and turn the information over
to the suspect's attorney.

19:22.669 --> 19:25.605
Yes. Yes. Good night.

19:25.693 --> 19:28.074
Rusty!
That's an L.A.P.D. computer.

19:28.108 --> 19:33.279
Everything you do on it is recorded
and subject to regular search.

19:33.313 --> 19:37.308
Good, then it'll finally show that
someone has been looking for my mother.

19:37.451 --> 19:39.352
Okay, Rusty. Time to wrap it up.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.420
10:30. It's lights out around here.

19:41.455 --> 19:43.523
At my last job, 10:30 was rush hour.

19:46.994 --> 19:49.228
About that.

19:49.263 --> 19:53.633
Do you think it might be a good
idea for you to talk to someone?

19:53.667 --> 19:55.501
I don't talk to shrinks.

19:55.536 --> 19:57.769
- Mmm.
- You should see one, maybe.

19:58.104 --> 20:00.939
Find out what happened to your marriage.

20:01.675 --> 20:04.777
Nothing happened.
We're separated.

20:04.811 --> 20:06.812
Well, you still keep his stuff here.

20:06.846 --> 20:09.948
Well, he needs to stop by sometimes.
He's the father of my children,

20:09.983 --> 20:11.684
and there's some very
good things about him,

20:11.718 --> 20:13.452
although I can't think
of one at the moment.

20:14.788 --> 20:18.757
Okay. You don't want to
talk to a psychologist.

20:18.792 --> 20:22.728
I understand that. Let's
discuss how the spare bedroom ...

20:22.762 --> 20:24.697
Will get me out of your way
and make it that much easier

20:24.731 --> 20:26.865
for you to forget about
me and my problems,

20:26.900 --> 20:28.634
which no one seems
to care about, anyway.

20:32.906 --> 20:35.174
Rusty, we're doing everything
we can to find your mother.

20:35.208 --> 20:38.644
I've got a want out on
her and her boyfriend.

20:38.678 --> 20:40.779
We are tracking the credit
card they were using.

20:40.814 --> 20:44.450
We are going to come
across them any day.

20:44.484 --> 20:47.086
Well, then why am I being asked to
study for this stupid catholic school?

20:47.120 --> 20:49.855
It's not a stupid school at all.
Both of my kids went there,

20:49.889 --> 20:53.025
and they got into great colleges.
And that is something

20:53.059 --> 20:56.028
I'd like you to start thinking
about, as smart as you are.

20:56.062 --> 21:00.065
Hey, hey!
I am not your child. Okay?

21:00.100 --> 21:02.818
And I won't be here long enough to
go to this terrific school of yours,

21:02.819 --> 21:05.537
and people like me don't get into
college, and we both know that.

21:05.572 --> 21:08.006
And, you know, to remind you
how bad you are at your job,

21:08.041 --> 21:11.577
I am going to be sleeping here
in the den or the living room

21:11.611 --> 21:13.712
or whatever you call this
until you get fed up enough

21:13.747 --> 21:15.714
to do something that is
really going to help me.

21:19.953 --> 21:23.555
<i> I just can't go along with this.</i>

21:23.590 --> 21:28.093
- Please don't get me involved.
- I understand, Ms. Barker,

21:28.128 --> 21:31.497
and I'm not asking you to press
charges against Chad Raber,

21:31.531 --> 21:36.569
but we found the video
you made for him.

21:37.604 --> 21:42.107
I was just... thanking Chad.

21:42.142 --> 21:44.643
You're making a mistake.
Nothing happened.

21:47.147 --> 21:51.209
Ma'am, you're not
Chad Raber's only victim.

21:52.886 --> 21:55.721
I kept
wondering if somehow I gave him

21:55.755 --> 21:57.589
mixed signals or something, you know?

21:57.624 --> 22:04.696
Like, maybe I encouraged him,
but, I mean, he's married.

22:04.731 --> 22:07.399
Did he ever threaten you?

22:07.433 --> 22:09.802
You have to understand.

22:09.836 --> 22:14.673
Chad had this way of
making you trust him.

22:14.707 --> 22:19.444
I ... I told him things
about my marriage.

22:19.479 --> 22:23.015
And he said
that if I made a big deal

22:23.016 --> 22:26.552
about what he did to me, that...
he would tell my husband

22:26.586 --> 22:29.621
the things that I talked
about in confidence ...

22:29.656 --> 22:31.957
things that my husband can't know.

22:31.991 --> 22:34.693
Ma'am, can you tell me where
you were yesterday morning

22:34.727 --> 22:37.095
between 6:00 and 9:00 a.m.?

22:37.130 --> 22:41.834
Oh, my god.
You don't think that I killed Chad, do you?

22:41.868 --> 22:44.436
We just need to eliminate
anyone who could be a suspect.

22:44.470 --> 22:48.574
- We're trying to find his killer.
- Why do you need to do that?

22:48.608 --> 22:52.211
- Ma'am?
- I mean, Chad's dead, right?

22:54.214 --> 22:57.216
And he can't do this
to anyone else, so...

22:57.250 --> 22:59.751
why bother catching the killer?

23:04.824 --> 23:07.759
- Chad Raber was a monster.
- And a serial rapist.

23:07.794 --> 23:12.664
I know these ladies he victimized
supposedly increase our suspect pool,

23:12.699 --> 23:14.800
but they all have really good alibis.

23:14.834 --> 23:16.768
Martino shouldn't be able to use them

23:16.803 --> 23:17.936
to get off with just a slap on the wrist.

23:17.971 --> 23:20.739
- I mean, come on.
- I've been thinking about that.

23:20.773 --> 23:23.475
Martino knows hanging Chad
raped his daughter,

23:23.509 --> 23:24.743
so what does he do?

23:24.777 --> 23:27.679
I've been wondering the same thing.
You kill Chad, take his IPad.

23:27.714 --> 23:31.116
Why? Toss it in your own dumpster?
No, no. That's stupid.

23:31.150 --> 23:34.186
- We've met dumber criminals.
- But this criminal was smart enough

23:34.220 --> 23:36.722
to go into Chad Raber's IPad
and erase all his victims' videos.

23:36.756 --> 23:38.690
Except for the one of his own daughter.

23:38.725 --> 23:41.026
Which is the only video
that would show his motive.

23:41.060 --> 23:42.995
Maybe Martino thought
that if he got caught,

23:43.029 --> 23:45.697
he could use the video of Amanda
to get sympathy from a jury.

23:45.732 --> 23:48.133
Nine videos would get
him even more sympathy.

23:48.167 --> 23:50.969
Right. Right. Insightful, Captain.

23:51.004 --> 23:55.707
Oh, god, Sykes. Would you just
give it a rest for a minute?

23:55.742 --> 23:57.976
Look, Martino had no reason
to erase those other videos

23:58.011 --> 24:00.512
except for the one of his daughter.

24:00.546 --> 24:02.814
Then the killer is someone
who is trying to frame him.

24:02.849 --> 24:04.383
Which means it had to be

24:04.417 --> 24:06.018
somebody who knew Martino
would be a suspect.

24:06.052 --> 24:09.554
There is really only one person
who fits that description.

24:12.725 --> 24:14.860
This way, Mrs. Raber.

24:25.104 --> 24:26.538
<i> I know that man.</i>

24:26.572 --> 24:30.642
- Which man?
- In the picture out there on your board.

24:30.677 --> 24:32.214
His name is Martino something.

24:32.276 --> 24:34.758
He's the one who filed those
insane charges against Chad.

24:34.875 --> 24:36.337
We are very sorry.
You were not supposed to see those.

24:36.338 --> 24:38.449
Do you think he has something
to do with my husband's murder?

24:38.483 --> 24:40.785
- It's too early for us to ...
- No, please! Just tell me!

24:40.786 --> 24:41.719
Did that man kill Chad?

24:45.491 --> 24:48.160
Mr. Martino did seem
obsessed with your husband.

24:48.194 --> 24:52.197
Filing those rape charges on
behalf of his crazy daughter

24:52.231 --> 24:54.700
and threatening to sue
you to bankruptcy, so, yes.

24:54.734 --> 25:00.806
At this point, we can say that
he is one of our prime suspects.

25:00.840 --> 25:03.041
One of them?

25:03.076 --> 25:06.712
Mrs. Raber, another
woman came forward ...

25:06.746 --> 25:09.881
a client of your husband's who
heard about his murder on TV.

25:09.916 --> 25:14.052
She claims that Chad sexually
assaulted her, as well.

25:14.087 --> 25:17.439
This woman also claims that your husband

25:17.440 --> 25:20.792
recorded videos of her
and other alleged victims.

25:20.827 --> 25:24.663
- Now, we can't prove that, but ...
- Chad was not a rapist!

25:24.697 --> 25:26.798
He made women feel
better about their bodies.

25:26.833 --> 25:30.535
He was a positive presence in people's
lives, unlike that Amanda person,

25:30.570 --> 25:32.804
who's spreading lies just
trying to get someone,

25:32.839 --> 25:35.841
anyone, to help her destroy
everything that Chad built.

25:35.875 --> 25:39.144
We absolutely agree that having
these other women come forward

25:39.178 --> 25:42.414
makes it easier for Mr. Martino
to deny his involvement.

25:42.448 --> 25:46.451
It's a sick way to poison
the jury pool ... sick.

25:46.486 --> 25:47.786
So what are you gonna do?

25:47.820 --> 25:52.485
If you could locate your husband's
cell, it would help us enormously.

25:52.586 --> 25:57.195
- In what way?
- Well, these so-called victims

25:57.230 --> 26:01.033
say your husband videotaped
them with his phone.

26:01.067 --> 26:05.637
Now, if that's true, we can probably
find those recordings somewhere.

26:05.671 --> 26:10.742
But if we can't find them, then that
proves these people are just liars.

26:10.777 --> 26:14.146
You just need to stay strong

26:14.180 --> 26:18.784
until we can arrest
the man who killed your husband.

26:18.818 --> 26:20.952
Come here. Come here.

26:20.987 --> 26:24.656
Thank you.

26:24.690 --> 26:26.191
Thank you.

26:27.593 --> 26:28.894
Oh! I almost forgot.

26:28.996 --> 26:33.831
We found your husband's IPad.

26:36.602 --> 26:39.504
That's wonderful.
Um, thank you.

26:41.707 --> 26:45.944
- Um, where'd you find it?
- We can't discuss that... yet.

26:45.978 --> 26:49.915
- But it helps your case?
- I am sure of it.

27:03.563 --> 27:05.897
<i> As long as we keep
our signal on the device,</i>

27:05.932 --> 27:09.701
- I can follow her anywhere.
- I hope it's not to Mexico.

27:11.137 --> 27:13.405
As soon as she opens the IPad,

27:13.439 --> 27:16.575
we should be able to
mirror it on these monitors.

27:16.609 --> 27:20.078
<i>- There we go.
- Come on. Come on, come on, come on.</i>

27:20.113 --> 27:22.914
Went straight for the videos.
Not wasting any time.

27:24.951 --> 27:30.856
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

27:30.890 --> 27:33.458
Except for Amanda, she's
deleting them all again.

27:33.493 --> 27:34.960
Put them back.

27:39.132 --> 27:42.968
<i>No! No, no, no, no, no, no.
What's going on?</i>

27:44.070 --> 27:46.505
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

27:46.539 --> 27:50.809
- Not so fast, buzz. May I?
- Be my guest.

27:50.843 --> 27:53.545
So she is trying to
frame Amanda's father.

27:53.579 --> 27:56.047
And get rid of other possible litigants.

27:56.082 --> 27:58.183
<i>No! Why do they
keep coming back!</i>

27:58.217 --> 28:02.020
<i>Oh! Bastard!
Why did you have to videotape them?!</i>

28:02.054 --> 28:04.589
<i>I'd kill you again
if I could! I'd kill you again!</i>

28:04.624 --> 28:07.559
<i>- Take her.
- God! What?</i>

28:07.593 --> 28:09.394
<i>Ma'am, could you step
out of the car, please?</i>

28:09.428 --> 28:10.829
<i>- Why?
- You know why.</i>

28:10.863 --> 28:13.263
<i>What ... are you doing?
Why are you doing this?</i>

28:13.380 --> 28:16.529
<i>- Because you're under arrest.
- What do you mean?</i>

28:16.669 --> 28:18.058
Another good arrest.

28:18.198 --> 28:20.138
<i>- You have the right to remain silent.
- No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.</i>

28:20.173 --> 28:22.874
<i>I can explain this. You don't
understand. You don't understand!</i>

28:22.909 --> 28:24.409
Oh, yes, we do.

28:31.702 --> 28:33.654
<i> I don't have
any physical evidence. </i>

28:33.689 --> 28:35.022
That's not strictly true.

28:35.057 --> 28:36.791
She had her husband's
cellphone in her purse.

28:36.825 --> 28:38.559
Whoop-dee-doo! Prepare
the lethal injection now.

28:38.594 --> 28:41.229
Did it have a picture of her
beating her husband's brains in?

28:41.263 --> 28:43.097
Because otherwise ...

28:43.132 --> 28:45.666
The print report from the gym
shows what I thought it would.

28:45.701 --> 28:48.636
There's nothing on the
handle of the murder weapon.

28:48.670 --> 28:53.040
But I think the prints that we did
find could still help us make the deal.

28:53.075 --> 28:56.611
Deal?
W-what kind of deal?

28:57.846 --> 29:00.448
Listen. They're only
offering involuntary

29:00.449 --> 29:03.050
manslaughter with probation
and no time served.

29:03.085 --> 29:07.789
- Are you actually considering that?
- It seems more reasonable than homicide

29:07.823 --> 29:10.057
since we have nothing
linking annette Raber

29:10.092 --> 29:12.660
to the murder or to the
planting of the IPad.

29:12.694 --> 29:14.896
She admitted killing him!
We all heard her!

29:14.930 --> 29:19.100
She said, and I quote,
"if I could, I would kill you again."

29:19.134 --> 29:20.802
And that might mean

29:20.836 --> 29:23.137
if someone else hadn't already
murdered her rapist husband,

29:23.172 --> 29:25.873
she would like to do it herself.
And even if her attorney

29:25.908 --> 29:28.576
let her provide us with
a complete confession,

29:28.610 --> 29:32.013
once the defense calls all
nine rape victims to the stand,

29:32.047 --> 29:35.082
instead of convicting annette Raber,
the jury will give her a medal.

29:35.117 --> 29:37.718
Since when do we act on
what the jury might say?

29:37.753 --> 29:39.554
It's the evidence that matters.

29:39.588 --> 29:42.089
And the evidence says she
picked up the kettlebell

29:42.124 --> 29:45.193
and deliberately pounded her
husband in the head three times.

29:45.227 --> 29:47.895
The first hit, we give her.
They were married.

29:47.930 --> 29:50.932
<i>The second and third ...
that was intent.</i>

29:57.739 --> 29:59.807
It's kind of hard 'cause I
see everyone's point of view.

30:01.610 --> 30:05.012
Before she can express her own opinion,

30:05.047 --> 30:08.783
Sykes needs to hear
it from you, Captain.

30:10.319 --> 30:14.889
I think we should let annette Raber
plead to involuntary manslaughter,

30:14.923 --> 30:19.159
see what she says in her statement
of facts, and negotiate up from there.

30:19.761 --> 30:22.730
And the next time that we
pick up a cold-blooded killer,

30:22.764 --> 30:26.834
I'll be sure to say,
"you're under arrest for murder!

30:26.869 --> 30:29.370
Unless you have a good excuse."

30:29.404 --> 30:33.875
Sometimes good excuses
make great confessions.

30:33.909 --> 30:36.210
Look, you want to arrest
someone for murder,

30:36.245 --> 30:39.747
then turn them over to the
courts to decide their fate.

30:39.781 --> 30:42.116
I want to walk them directly
to their prison cell.

30:42.150 --> 30:45.152
This isn't just about policy.

30:45.187 --> 30:48.890
This is a chance for us
to properly finish what we started,

30:48.924 --> 30:52.660
and that is something
that I really like.

30:56.698 --> 30:59.000
<i>Involuntary manslaughter
is fair and reasonable.</i>

30:59.034 --> 31:01.102
Your own investigation
shows that Chad Raber

31:01.136 --> 31:02.837
terrorized at least nine women.

31:02.871 --> 31:05.339
I would add Annette
Raber to that list ...

31:05.374 --> 31:07.942
more sinned against than sinning.

31:07.976 --> 31:12.346
This is not a religious service.
We do hope god forgives Mrs. Raber.

31:12.381 --> 31:15.583
However, we speak for the victim.

31:15.617 --> 31:19.320
Well, let's talk about how
the jury will feel about that, hmm?

31:19.354 --> 31:22.223
Because when I introduce them
to this monster, Chad Raber,

31:22.257 --> 31:24.759
and tell them what he
did, they'll be asking my

31:24.760 --> 31:27.261
client to autograph this
little photo, and you know it.

31:27.296 --> 31:30.698
Involuntary manslaughter, probation.
She does no time.

31:30.732 --> 31:33.401
Anything else, we fight it out in court.

31:34.403 --> 31:36.904
- Where are we going?
- I want you to see

31:36.939 --> 31:38.806
what your new head
of Major Crimes is doing.

31:38.840 --> 31:40.608
I know what's she's
doing. I approved it.

31:40.642 --> 31:45.246
Look. Trials cost a lot of money.
You want to spend $2 million

31:45.280 --> 31:48.649
on a case where we might
not even get a conviction.

31:48.684 --> 31:51.731
Really?
What are you trying to prove?

31:53.789 --> 31:56.223
The suspect has the right to a trial.
The state does not.

31:56.258 --> 31:58.025
Nor do we have an
obligation to go to court.

31:58.060 --> 32:04.565
Let this lady decide what she wants.
And give Raydor a chance.

32:04.599 --> 32:06.334
<i>... nine separate women ...</i>

32:06.368 --> 32:07.868
<i- >- - She lost control of her emotions.
Oh, really?

32:07.903 --> 32:11.973
<i>Then tell me why my victim's wife
surreptitiously deleted videos</i>

32:12.007 --> 32:13.708
which were evidence of those crimes?

32:13.742 --> 32:15.609
You mean the videos

32:15.644 --> 32:17.645
your Detectives surreptitiously
placed on her husband's IPad?

32:17.679 --> 32:19.580
Well, that's simple.
She was ashamed.

32:19.614 --> 32:22.466
Mrs. Raber discovered the videos,
and because she didn't want

32:22.467 --> 32:25.319
to face the truth about her
husband, she tried to erase them all.

32:25.354 --> 32:27.688
Oh, not all, counselor.

32:27.723 --> 32:31.625
Mrs. Raber left the video
of Amanda on the IPad,

32:31.660 --> 32:33.594
and then she placed it in the dumpster

32:33.628 --> 32:36.796
outside of Jim Martino's
place of business.

32:38.333 --> 32:40.601
Where is she going with this?

32:40.635 --> 32:43.104
Mrs. Raber may not have known about
her husband's crimes...  - I didn't know.

32:43.138 --> 32:46.941
...but when she discovered them,
murdering Chad and framing Jim Martino

32:46.975 --> 32:49.276
killed two birds with one kettlebell.

32:49.311 --> 32:52.113
As long as no other rape
victims came forward.

32:52.147 --> 32:55.349
That was the real problem,
wasn't it, Annette?

32:55.384 --> 33:01.322
A solitary, unstable woman claiming rape
you could probably avoid, but nine victims?

33:01.356 --> 33:04.191
A civil action suit by all those women

33:04.226 --> 33:06.627
<i>could drive your business into ruin.</i>

33:06.661 --> 33:08.195
<i> That's why she
deleted all the videos</i>

33:08.230 --> 33:10.631
but the one that
incriminated Amanda's father.

33:10.665 --> 33:14.568
- She was protecting her finances.
- This was not a crime of passion.

33:14.603 --> 33:17.038
Mrs. Raber bashed her husband's head in,

33:17.072 --> 33:20.875
then she very deliberately
tried to frame someone else

33:20.909 --> 33:24.011
for what she'd done to
avoid financial loss.

33:24.046 --> 33:25.679
<i>Sounds like first-degree murder to me,</i>

33:25.714 --> 33:28.582
<i>and those are the
charges I'm going to file.</i>

33:28.617 --> 33:31.852
Tell me again ... your
problem with this is what?

33:31.887 --> 33:32.887
<i> You have no evidence
of premeditation.</i>

33:32.921 --> 33:34.588
<i>Oh, yes, I do ...</i>

33:34.623 --> 33:37.858
The kettlebell your client
used to end her husband's life.

33:39.094 --> 33:42.263
- I was told it had no prints.
- Oh, you're right, it didn't.

33:42.297 --> 33:44.665
But all the other
weights in her gym did,

33:44.699 --> 33:47.668
indicating Mrs. Raber wiped
the murder weapon clean

33:47.702 --> 33:50.204
and used gloves when
she killed her husband.

33:51.807 --> 33:53.607
Well ...
wait, wait, wait, wait.

33:53.642 --> 33:56.834
Don't just go. Counter.

33:57.646 --> 33:59.947
- Manslaughter. 11 years.
- What?!

33:59.981 --> 34:02.783
That's the maximum.
Low term. Three years.

34:02.818 --> 34:07.121
11 or I arrest her on charges of
murder and we take our chances.

34:07.155 --> 34:08.922
I'll parade Chad Raber's
victims in front of the jury.

34:08.956 --> 34:12.610
<i> And I'll show the jury a
video of your client erasing those</i>

34:12.610 --> 34:16.263
women as if they never existed in
order to send an innocent man to prison.

34:20.869 --> 34:22.203
Six years.

34:22.237 --> 34:27.074
I'm on the train to 11,
and that extremely gracious offer

34:27.109 --> 34:29.976
depends on what your
client will say to a judge.

34:30.011 --> 34:32.346
And I want to hear it.

34:32.347 --> 34:34.681
Right now.

34:44.993 --> 34:49.063
I knew Chad took revealing pictures
of his clients. It was his job.

34:50.364 --> 34:53.801
And then a Detective came by and told us

34:53.835 --> 34:57.638
that one of our clients
had accused Chad of rape.

34:57.672 --> 35:00.274
And I started to wonder,
so I looked at his IPad,

35:00.308 --> 35:01.942
and I found all of these...

35:01.977 --> 35:07.581
horrible videos
of these young girls.

35:07.616 --> 35:11.886
And... I realized then in my
heart that Chad was a rapist.

35:14.589 --> 35:17.992
So, I went to the gym that morning
and found him doing his workout, and...

35:18.026 --> 35:22.830
while he was hanging upside down...

35:24.599 --> 35:25.966
Aah!

35:26.001 --> 35:32.617
...I stopped him from ever
hurting anyone ever again.

35:35.076 --> 35:37.678
Thank you, Mrs.
Raber, and the next

35:37.679 --> 35:40.281
time you're in that
situation, just dial 911.

35:40.315 --> 35:43.784
So, having found that you are competent,
that you know your rights,

35:43.818 --> 35:45.619
and that your statement is voluntary,

35:45.654 --> 35:48.022
I am going to accept your
guilty plea to manslaughter.

35:48.056 --> 35:50.557
Ms. Hobbs, Mr. Kelly,
you have anything to add?

35:50.792 --> 35:52.659
- No, your honor.
- No, sir.

35:52.694 --> 35:54.161
Okay. We're adjourned.

35:54.195 --> 35:56.763
Counsel will approach.
We'll set a date for sentencing.

35:56.798 --> 35:59.599
I'd like to do it fairly soon
since you already agreed on 11 years.

35:59.634 --> 36:02.169
How about, uh, Thursday
after next, 4:00 p.m.?

36:02.203 --> 36:06.306
Well, a rapist marries a murderer.
The Rabers were made for each other.

36:06.340 --> 36:08.041
Hey, look at it this way ...

36:08.076 --> 36:11.778
At least we don't have to come back
here for a trial in another two years.

36:11.813 --> 36:12.779
I hate court.

36:12.814 --> 36:15.615
Maybe I'm old fashioned,
but I like it when a jury decides.

36:18.586 --> 36:22.756
Premeditated murder.
Pled down to 11 years for manslaughter.

36:22.790 --> 36:27.360
Is this the way it's going to be?
Cutting people slack

36:27.395 --> 36:31.131
for pretending to take
justice into their own hands?

36:31.165 --> 36:33.166
Major Crimes just closed the case

36:33.201 --> 36:36.136
with no physical evidence
and a rapist for a victim.

36:36.170 --> 36:39.806
Suspect was found guilty two
days after we discovered the body.

36:39.841 --> 36:43.510
I just saved hundreds
of thousands of dollars

36:43.544 --> 36:46.246
that I can use for
overtime and DNA tests.

36:46.280 --> 36:49.683
I can't tell you for sure if
this is how it's going to be,

36:49.717 --> 36:52.152
but I certainly hope so.

37:00.261 --> 37:01.961
Then I quit.

37:21.913 --> 37:23.446
So, you're leaving?

37:23.481 --> 37:26.917
Well, maybe you're a better
Detective than I thought.

37:26.951 --> 37:30.453
How'd I give myself away?
Packing up all my stuff?

37:30.488 --> 37:33.056
Looky here.

37:33.090 --> 37:36.993
My whole career fits
in one cardboard box.

37:37.028 --> 37:40.130
You know, lots of older
people enjoy retirement.

37:40.164 --> 37:42.232
I mean, my grandparents,
for example ...

37:42.266 --> 37:43.834
y-you remind me of them a little.

37:43.868 --> 37:46.937
They just retired to the Gulf
coast of Florida, and they love it.

37:46.971 --> 37:48.505
You should check it out.

37:48.539 --> 37:52.475
It's terrific for active seniors,
and they have singles night, too.

37:52.510 --> 37:54.845
Maybe you could meet
someone special.

37:55.680 --> 37:58.582
- He's not retiring.
- How can you be so sure, Julio?

37:58.616 --> 38:01.218
- You can't afford it.
- What are you so upset about?

38:01.252 --> 38:03.887
Dirtbags get deals ...
it happens every day.

38:03.921 --> 38:06.323
It's not the deal, Flynn.
It's that woman.

38:06.357 --> 38:10.193
After four wives,
five divorces, six Chiefs,

38:10.228 --> 38:12.262
three partners,
and two parakeets ...

38:12.296 --> 38:14.865
who live a longer than
I expected them to ...

38:14.899 --> 38:17.200
I just don't want to be forced into

38:17.235 --> 38:20.136
another long-standing,
unhappy relationship.

38:20.171 --> 38:21.938
I completely agree.

38:25.543 --> 38:28.778
- I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.
- There's a fresh pot in the break room.

38:28.813 --> 38:33.115
- Can you get me one? Two sugars.
- Come get your own, genius.

38:39.156 --> 38:41.825
Lieutenant, should I
say how much I appreciate

38:41.859 --> 38:43.860
your service and your experience?

38:43.895 --> 38:46.062
Should I remind you that we ...
both of us ...

38:46.097 --> 38:49.232
are probably dealing with
misconceptions about each other?

38:49.267 --> 38:54.371
Can we improve our work relationship
through dinner and a drink?

38:54.405 --> 38:56.139
God, no.

38:57.475 --> 39:01.244
Look, Captain.
This isn't just about you.

39:01.279 --> 39:04.748
After all I've given to the L.A.P.D.,

39:04.782 --> 39:09.886
anyone else besides me
sitting in that office is an insult.

39:12.423 --> 39:14.024
And it's not fair.

39:14.058 --> 39:18.295
You have been a homicide
Detective for how long,

39:18.329 --> 39:21.765
and you're still
expecting life to be fair.

39:21.799 --> 39:27.404
Look, if I stay, I'll only complain
and point out your mistakes.

39:27.438 --> 39:30.907
Lieutenant, aren't
you experienced enough

39:30.942 --> 39:34.811
to speak your mind with
me and remember my rank?

39:34.845 --> 39:39.215
Well, of course I am.
The problem is I don't want to.

39:40.584 --> 39:47.257
This whole situation, it ...
it just sucks.

39:47.291 --> 39:49.826
It does a little. I know.

39:51.829 --> 39:54.197
Look.

39:54.231 --> 39:58.301
Why don't you agree to stay
on at Major Crimes only ...

39:58.336 --> 40:02.405
only till you find someplace
completely fair to work.

40:08.245 --> 40:10.981
Think about it.

40:20.524 --> 40:23.326
Hey.
Hey, what are you doing?

40:23.361 --> 40:26.429
I still need those to
study for that stupid test.

40:26.464 --> 40:30.200
Your things don't belong here.
You can study in your room.

40:30.234 --> 40:31.968
It not my room.

40:32.003 --> 40:34.070
But this is the living room,
and it is definitely mine,

40:34.105 --> 40:37.073
and your stuff needs to go.

40:37.108 --> 40:38.942
All right.
Well, then I'm gone, too.

40:38.976 --> 40:40.343
How about that, huh?
And I mean out the door.

40:40.378 --> 40:42.012
You want to leave?

40:42.046 --> 40:44.614
I am the best hope you
have of finding your mother.

40:44.648 --> 40:48.118
Okay, look, look. I will try not
to make unnecessary demands on you,

40:48.152 --> 40:50.220
but by 11:00 p.m., you're in that room.

40:50.254 --> 40:52.022
You cannot tell me to go to my room.

40:52.056 --> 40:56.026
I am not a child, first of all,
and second of all, you are not my mother.

40:56.060 --> 40:57.327
You're right. I'm not your mother.

40:57.361 --> 40:59.029
And how do we know that?
Because I am here.

41:05.369 --> 41:09.072
I'm here.
And your mother is not.

41:09.106 --> 41:13.109
And you're gonna have to try
and make the best of it.
