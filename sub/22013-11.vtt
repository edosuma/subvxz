Previously on Empire...

00:01.865 --> 00:02.953
Lucious' security will

00:02.953 --> 00:05.314
rush him out the back entrance
trying to protect his ass.

00:05.315 --> 00:06.351
That's when we get him.

00:07.073 --> 00:09.385
There's been a shooting.
I think someone is dead.

00:09.386 --> 00:13.155
You should go be back with your
baby mama with your clown ass.

00:13.156 --> 00:16.312
We're broke.
You, me, the other ex-wife.

00:16.314 --> 00:18.360
- It was a Ponzi scheme.
- Let me handle this.

00:18.361 --> 00:21.830
I'm trying to save Dwight,
not hurt him.

00:21.831 --> 00:25.434
What you have is not love.
You're toxic.

00:25.435 --> 00:28.070
I decide who I am, not her.

00:29.372 --> 00:32.341
Oh, God. I have to tell him.

Please don't hate me.

01:04.873 --> 01:06.909
Lucious!

01:06.910 --> 01:08.344
The bomb...

01:08.345 --> 01:11.680
I-I tried to kill you...

01:31.234 --> 01:33.369
So what else is on the agenda?

01:33.370 --> 01:36.305
I need you to use
all your police contacts

01:36.306 --> 01:39.275
to get me all the information
from the night my car blew up.

01:39.276 --> 01:41.677
Well, look, look, I got the files,

01:41.678 --> 01:43.379
but, uh, it's a dead end.

01:43.380 --> 01:45.147
Anything in particular
you're looking for?

01:45.148 --> 01:47.116
Yeah.

01:47.117 --> 01:49.918
Witness statements.

01:49.919 --> 01:52.321
Especially those given by my family.

01:52.322 --> 01:54.490
- I want to see Andre's.
- Are you serious?

01:56.760 --> 01:59.295
- Okay, what's this about?
- I don't know.

01:59.296 --> 02:01.330
A feeling and maybe a nightmare,

02:01.331 --> 02:04.500
but... it's something
I got to explore.

02:04.501 --> 02:07.569
Well, I got you.

02:09.506 --> 02:11.440
Feels good to be back.

02:11.441 --> 02:13.275
Uh, Porsha, call Eddie and, uh,

02:13.276 --> 02:16.211
- see where we are with rehearsals.
- Okay.

02:18.481 --> 02:21.083
I thought, since I'm back...

02:23.486 --> 02:25.120
Mm.

02:29.859 --> 02:32.394
Oh, man, I missed this.

02:33.496 --> 02:36.999
Not as much as I missed you.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.702
As a matter of fact, when you
coming back to my bed, woman?

02:39.703 --> 02:41.136
Oh, Lord Jesus, Lucious.

02:41.137 --> 02:42.805
We've been through a lot
these past couple of days.

02:42.806 --> 02:44.560
Yeah, man. Forget that
crazy bitch Claudia

02:45.475 --> 02:47.042
and all that stuff she went through.

02:47.043 --> 02:49.244
Yes, she was crazy and a bitch,

02:49.245 --> 02:52.514
but she said some things
in that cabin, and...

02:52.515 --> 02:54.116
you and I said some things

02:54.117 --> 02:56.185
that I just really
can't get out of my head.

02:56.186 --> 02:59.188
You're my one, I'm your one.

02:59.189 --> 03:01.023
Now what?

03:01.024 --> 03:03.826
Just let me think about it, Lucious.

03:03.827 --> 03:05.828
Give me some time.
I got a lot of work to do.

03:05.829 --> 03:08.530
Uh, Cookie, Becky and the A&R team

03:08.531 --> 03:10.165
waiting for you downstairs.

03:10.166 --> 03:11.867
See? Work.

03:11.868 --> 03:13.369
Don't forget Kelly Patel's

03:13.370 --> 03:14.970
- coming by today.
- Wait. Kelly Patel,

03:14.971 --> 03:16.839
- the tech giant?
- Yes. And

03:16.840 --> 03:18.440
if he likes my proposal,

03:18.441 --> 03:20.876
we got the money for
the back end of our 20 For 20.

03:20.877 --> 03:22.945
Just got
to get that ink on the contract.

03:22.946 --> 03:24.847
Not bad.

03:24.848 --> 03:27.182
You just gonna let him take
the throne back that fast?

03:27.183 --> 03:29.518
His face is on the label.

03:29.519 --> 03:31.920
Look, he's hungry to make
some noise. Let him roar.

03:31.921 --> 03:34.323
Don't get it twisted.

Once I make Tiana Empire's MVP,

05:45.154 --> 05:47.022
I'm gonna push through
a couple of deals here

05:47.023 --> 05:48.857
that put me back on top.

05:48.858 --> 05:50.726
Us back on top.

05:50.727 --> 05:53.228
Oh, so now we're talking about us?

05:53.229 --> 05:55.030
I just want my money, Eddie.

05:55.031 --> 05:56.665
I want my money.

05:56.666 --> 05:58.500
All right.

05:59.669 --> 06:00.736
- Yo, Tiana.
- Thank you.

06:00.737 --> 06:02.905
I seen how you looked at me
on stage today.

06:02.906 --> 06:05.273
That was acting.

06:22.892 --> 06:27.496
That's called "I miss you," idiot.

06:29.165 --> 06:31.667
Listen, I'm sorry how I acted.

06:31.668 --> 06:34.903
I didn't think
I would see Bella again.

06:34.904 --> 06:37.339
Yeah, well, if you ever
treat me like that again,

06:37.340 --> 06:39.508
it's on to the next.

06:42.412 --> 06:44.379
- Eddie.
- What's up, man?

06:44.380 --> 06:46.448
My man, thank you
for holding things down.

06:46.449 --> 06:47.883
Anything for family.

06:47.884 --> 06:50.118
Want to introduce you to Kelly Patel.

06:50.119 --> 06:51.753
The king of Silicon Valley?

06:51.754 --> 06:55.390
He needs no introduction
in this house.

06:55.391 --> 06:57.926
Glad to see that you're back
running things, Lucious.

06:57.927 --> 06:59.595
It's really nice to be back, man.

06:59.596 --> 07:03.131
- It is.
- So,

07:03.132 --> 07:05.400
Eddie tells me you've got a hell
of a deal for me.

07:05.401 --> 07:08.937
- Absolutely. Uh...
- Hold up a sec, Cook.

07:08.938 --> 07:11.773
I want to run this by you.
Now imagine this with your next

07:11.774 --> 07:13.742
generation of phones and computers,

07:13.743 --> 07:16.445
if it came with a free
subscription to Empire XStream.

07:16.446 --> 07:17.396
Free?

07:17.397 --> 07:19.781
Well, we're gonna give
it to you at a discounted

07:19.782 --> 07:23.418
rate so you can pass it on
to your customers as a perk.

07:23.419 --> 07:26.321
It's a perfect marriage
between Empire's hipness,

07:26.322 --> 07:27.756
your hot tech.

07:27.757 --> 07:29.424
The synergy will generate millions.

07:29.425 --> 07:32.294
Where's the data to back
that up? And quite frankly,

07:32.295 --> 07:34.129
I'm not certain
if Empire is a good fit for me.

07:34.130 --> 07:35.998
Well, why don't you let me
get my people

07:35.999 --> 07:38.266
to run these numbers by you,
and you'll see the fit.

07:38.267 --> 07:40.769
Why waste time?

07:40.770 --> 07:43.005
- Pardon?
- Look.

07:43.006 --> 07:45.240
You already know how
our demographics mesh up.

07:45.241 --> 07:47.809
Otherwise you wouldn't be here.

07:47.810 --> 07:49.378
Now, if you would like
to negotiate how much

07:49.379 --> 07:52.514
we're going to sell XStream
to you for, then let's talk.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.816
But don't pretend
like you don't want this deal.

07:54.817 --> 07:57.819
You and the whole damn world
knows that Empire is the king

07:57.820 --> 07:59.521
of cutting-edge entertainment,

07:59.522 --> 08:02.891
and that's exactly
what you want for your company.

08:02.892 --> 08:05.193
It's true.

08:05.194 --> 08:07.896
Hell yeah, it's true.
So are you in or out?

08:09.532 --> 08:11.867
Yes?

08:14.837 --> 08:16.405
This is gonna be fun.

08:16.406 --> 08:20.375
Hell yeah, it's gonna be fun.

08:20.376 --> 08:22.781
- There he is.
- Welcome back to the game, Eddie.

08:22.782 --> 08:24.646
I'll run Kelly through some details.

08:24.647 --> 08:25.981
- Lucious. It was a pleasure.
- My man.

08:25.982 --> 08:29.518
- I know.
- Sounds good, boss.

08:29.519 --> 08:32.154
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

08:32.155 --> 08:35.557
Are you sure we can pull this
off without the Lyons' drama?

08:35.558 --> 08:39.160
Nothing to worry about.
That's all behind them.

08:44.634 --> 08:46.234
I appreciate you
bringing me home, man,

08:46.235 --> 08:47.869
but don't you have rehearsal
for the showcase?

08:47.870 --> 08:49.871
Yes, I do.

08:49.872 --> 08:52.574
However, more importantly,

08:52.575 --> 08:53.875
I have only one big brother.

08:53.876 --> 08:56.411
So... welcome home.

09:09.659 --> 09:13.161
This was the last place I saw Pamela.

09:14.330 --> 09:17.599
She was so damn real.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.668
Hmm.

09:21.104 --> 09:23.538
If this deal with Kelly Patel's

09:23.539 --> 09:26.174
gonna go through, we're
gonna have to be squeaky clean.

09:26.175 --> 09:29.411
- Uh-huh.
- No scandals, no... no bad press.

09:29.412 --> 09:31.046
What bad press?

09:31.047 --> 09:33.014
Come on, brother. Your kidnapping,

09:33.015 --> 09:35.083
- Hakeem's messy custody trial...
- Not to mention

09:35.084 --> 09:37.252
Jamal beating up his ex
and then killing Angelo.

09:37.253 --> 09:39.654
- All right, all right, all right.
- Hey.

09:39.655 --> 09:42.023
I got some bad news,
and it ain't looking good.

09:42.024 --> 09:45.393
Oh, God. Every time Porsha
comes in here with that tablet,

09:45.394 --> 09:47.963
something done went wrong.
What is it now?

09:47.964 --> 09:51.032
My cousin works for TMI and got
ahold of a teaser clip of TBD.

09:51.033 --> 09:52.033
Who?

09:52.034 --> 09:54.069
The Three Black Divas.

09:54.070 --> 09:57.005
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, I dropped them

09:57.006 --> 09:58.140
from the label years ago.

09:58.141 --> 09:59.574
The full interview go live tomorrow,

09:59.575 --> 10:01.710
and it ain't lookin' pretty.

10:01.711 --> 10:04.079
TBD was one of Empire's first groups.

10:04.080 --> 10:06.982
I mean, Lucious even gave us our name.

10:06.983 --> 10:10.318
So when we heard about Cookie
Lyons' 20 For 20 project,

10:10.319 --> 10:12.154
we thought we would get a call,

10:12.155 --> 10:13.722
but clearly, she doesn't understand

10:13.723 --> 10:15.924
how important we are
to Empire's history.

10:15.925 --> 10:18.460
That's 'cause while
we were climbing the charts,

10:18.461 --> 10:20.595
she was somewhere
making license plates.

10:20.596 --> 10:22.664
- Wow.
- And her man

10:22.665 --> 10:24.966
- was dipping his pen in company ink,
- Okay.

10:24.967 --> 10:26.668
- So to speak.
- Listen, Cookie ain't talkin'

10:26.669 --> 10:29.271
- about the Empire sweatshop,
- Right.

10:29.272 --> 10:30.672
Where they locked up young musicians

10:30.673 --> 10:32.641
- until they produced a banger.
- Mm-hmm.

10:32.642 --> 10:35.710
So we're announcing our reunion album.

10:35.711 --> 10:37.512
It's gonna spill all the tea

10:37.513 --> 10:39.848
- on Empire.
- And any label

10:39.849 --> 10:41.983
that wants the reunion release

10:41.984 --> 10:44.186
can buy it... for the right price.

10:44.187 --> 10:45.620
Empire sweatshops.

10:45.621 --> 10:47.155
If this interview drops,

10:47.156 --> 10:48.657
Kelly Patel's gonna go bye-bye,

10:48.658 --> 10:50.358
and this whole deal's gonna be dead.

10:50.359 --> 10:51.426
No, I'm gonna fix this...

10:51.427 --> 10:52.661
No, no, no, no, no.

10:52.662 --> 10:54.196
I'll fix this.

10:54.197 --> 10:56.198
Becky, Porsha, come with me.

10:56.199 --> 10:57.532
All right.

10:59.202 --> 11:02.338
- Oh, God.
- We got to get this under control.

11:07.019 --> 11:09.387

12:29.668 --> 12:31.603
but they definitely
need some new material.

12:31.604 --> 12:34.272
Oh, girl, they need more
than new material, honey.

12:34.273 --> 12:36.107
- They need some new wardrobe.
- Mm-hmm.

12:36.108 --> 12:37.742
- And some new wigs.

12:45.686 --> 12:48.286
Welcome to Cord's grand opening.

12:48.287 --> 12:50.855
We got some free gift bags for you.

12:50.856 --> 12:52.457
Everybody just take one.

12:52.458 --> 12:54.159
Here you go.

12:54.160 --> 12:56.227
Thank you so much.

12:56.228 --> 12:58.730
Welcome to Cord's. Welcome to...

13:00.766 --> 13:02.433
Uh-uh. Don't act like
you don't know me.

13:02.434 --> 13:06.137
Not with my name all up in
your mouth in the interviews.

13:06.138 --> 13:07.972
Anything you have to say to us,
take it up with our publicist.

13:07.973 --> 13:09.474
Girl, you're singing in a damn mall.

13:09.475 --> 13:11.009
You can't even afford a publicist.

13:11.010 --> 13:14.345
Gimme that. This is for you.

13:14.346 --> 13:17.482
I knew it. I told you
they were gonna try to sue us.

13:17.483 --> 13:19.751
We are not afraid of any lawsuit.

13:19.752 --> 13:21.719
It's called free speech, sweetie.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.121
Open it, sweetie.

13:25.191 --> 13:28.126
Remember those? That's a contract.

13:28.127 --> 13:29.627
For your reunion album.

13:29.628 --> 13:30.795
What makes you think we want to...

13:30.796 --> 13:31.896
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:31.897 --> 13:33.498
I gotta hear this.

13:33.499 --> 13:35.934
Well, see, underneath
all of that anger of yours,

13:35.935 --> 13:37.302
I see a comeback.

13:37.303 --> 13:40.104
A really big comeback.

13:40.105 --> 13:42.640
Those are the best terms
you gonna find anywhere.

13:42.641 --> 13:44.008
One condition, though...

13:44.009 --> 13:46.911
snatch that interview before it airs.

13:48.480 --> 13:49.681
Okay, guess I'll see you
in the studio.

13:49.682 --> 13:51.516
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

13:51.517 --> 13:53.585
I have a condition of my own.

13:53.586 --> 13:55.753
Is it contagious?

13:57.890 --> 14:01.159
We need an apology from Lucious.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.461
He knows what for.

14:03.462 --> 14:06.531
Get us that and
you got yourself a deal.

14:06.532 --> 14:09.267
We'll be in touch.

14:13.005 --> 14:14.872
Come on, let's get ready
for the second set.

14:17.576 --> 14:18.576
Hey, hey, hey.

14:18.577 --> 14:20.211
What's up, Uncle Eddie?

14:23.882 --> 14:26.184
- Working on something?
- Yeah.

14:26.185 --> 14:29.320
We'll have to knock the socks
off of this Kelly Patel

14:29.321 --> 14:31.089
at the showcase tomorrow,
so I was thinking about

14:31.090 --> 14:33.191
doing something new... maybe
previewing one of my new songs.

14:33.192 --> 14:34.892
What you think?

14:34.893 --> 14:37.228
Jamal, Kelly's not an artist.

14:37.229 --> 14:40.898
He can be, you know,
just a little bit uptight.

14:40.899 --> 14:42.600
You understand?

14:42.601 --> 14:45.169
It's not some crazy song.
What's the problem?

14:45.170 --> 14:47.639
Given your involvement with the, uh...

14:47.640 --> 14:49.240
Angelo death,

14:49.241 --> 14:50.608
it might be better
if you sit out the showcase.

14:50.609 --> 14:52.176
That's a joke, right?

14:52.177 --> 14:53.678
Just until the ink dries
on this tech deal.

14:53.679 --> 14:55.313
You'll be right back in the spotlight.

14:56.382 --> 14:59.884
Oh, I see.

14:59.885 --> 15:01.853
So now all of Empire
is expected to bend over

15:01.854 --> 15:03.354
to be in business with Kelly Patel.

15:05.457 --> 15:06.591
My parents want me out?

15:06.592 --> 15:08.793
No.

15:08.794 --> 15:10.862
Not at all.

15:10.863 --> 15:13.931
They'd never ask you to do that.

15:13.932 --> 15:16.134
I'm coming to you,

15:16.135 --> 15:17.935
and I'm telling you

15:17.936 --> 15:19.237
what's best for the deal,

15:19.238 --> 15:22.640
and what's best for your family.

15:22.641 --> 15:24.642
It's entirely up to you.

15:24.643 --> 15:28.012
You decide.

15:33.252 --> 15:34.786
We'll talk later.

15:34.787 --> 15:36.521
Yeah.

15:37.990 --> 15:39.324
Wow, they spread this out for us.

15:39.325 --> 15:41.059
Yes, they did.

15:41.060 --> 15:42.593
And don't be putting
nothing in your purse,

15:42.594 --> 15:43.861
like you usually do...
have some class.

15:43.862 --> 15:47.098
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

15:47.099 --> 15:48.966
Y'all look well.

15:50.202 --> 15:52.470
Lucious Lyon. Look at you.

15:52.471 --> 15:54.505
You haven't aged a day.

15:54.506 --> 15:56.507
Nope. More like 20 years.

15:57.976 --> 16:00.478
Um, forgive my tardiness.

16:00.479 --> 16:04.282
I decided to stop
and commemorate our reunion

16:04.283 --> 16:08.152
with, um, a couple gifts.
Open them, please.

16:08.153 --> 16:09.487
Oh, wow.

16:09.488 --> 16:12.323
Three lovely crystal chalices

16:12.324 --> 16:15.059
for three lovely divas.

16:16.662 --> 16:18.363
Cookie said that you guys felt

16:18.364 --> 16:21.165
that you were owed an apology,

16:21.166 --> 16:23.768
and I would like to say, sincerely,

16:23.769 --> 16:26.504
if there's anything
that I've done in my past

16:26.505 --> 16:30.208
that has offended you in any way, I...

16:30.209 --> 16:33.344
am very, very sorry
that you feel like that,

16:33.345 --> 16:34.879
and I hope that we can now be friends

16:34.880 --> 16:36.381
and make music together.

16:36.382 --> 16:39.217
That's what you call a "faux-pology."

16:39.218 --> 16:41.085
What the hell else
did you expect, Brooke?

16:41.086 --> 16:42.286
We haven't heard anything
about sabotaging

16:42.287 --> 16:43.721
our album back in the day.

16:43.722 --> 16:45.323
Probably as sorry
about that as you are about

16:45.324 --> 16:47.425
kicking Tasha out the group
because she got too fat.

16:47.426 --> 16:48.960
Wait, what?

16:48.961 --> 16:50.561
- That's what that was?
- You was thick.

16:50.562 --> 16:52.764
- You looked good, though.
- I was thick, and I did look good.

16:52.765 --> 16:53.865
No, you know what? What you need to be

16:53.866 --> 16:55.666
apologizing for is letting

16:55.667 --> 16:57.969
that jailbird ex-wife of yours
run the show,

16:57.970 --> 16:59.570
and cutting us out of 20 for 20.

16:59.571 --> 17:01.339
Wait, no. No, let's not bring Cookie

17:01.340 --> 17:03.040
into any of this, all right?

17:03.041 --> 17:05.742
Oh, now you're all concerned
about Cookie.

17:05.743 --> 17:08.846
We held you down and
kept the lights on up in here.

17:08.847 --> 17:11.582
- You kept my lights on?
- Oh, yeah.

17:11.583 --> 17:13.718
Oh, and I'm sorry, wh-where was Cookie

17:13.719 --> 17:15.051
when you were feeling lonely

17:15.053 --> 17:17.054
and, uh, needed a little company?

17:20.559 --> 17:23.361
Okay, I see where this is going.

17:23.362 --> 17:26.030
- Mm, do you?
- It's going nowhere, because, um,

17:26.031 --> 17:27.531
maybe you guys aren't aware of it,

17:27.532 --> 17:29.300
but after my accident,

17:29.301 --> 17:32.170
I don't remember anything
that happened before that.

17:33.505 --> 17:35.339
But if you want a "sorry,"

17:35.340 --> 17:37.108
I will give you a "sorry."

17:37.109 --> 17:39.076
I am so sorry that, um,

17:39.077 --> 17:40.711
Three Black Divas is ancient history.

17:40.712 --> 17:43.047
- That's low. That's low.
- We're done.

17:43.048 --> 17:45.082
Okay, you know what? You can
stick your little showcase

17:45.083 --> 17:46.918
where the sun don't shine,

17:46.919 --> 17:48.920
'cause we already got an offer
from Phil Weiss's label.

17:48.921 --> 17:50.121
He's gonna release our diss track

17:50.122 --> 17:51.656
and burn your ass to the ground.

17:51.657 --> 17:52.924
Well, that's cute, because I can fit

17:52.925 --> 17:54.792
his promo budget in my sock.

17:54.793 --> 17:57.128
It's better than standing
taking this bull. Let's go.

17:57.129 --> 17:59.497
Well, do that. Um, but, Denise?

18:00.966 --> 18:03.234
Time has been very favorable to you.

18:04.570 --> 18:06.103
Not you.

18:06.104 --> 18:07.705
- Oh...
- Let's go.

18:07.706 --> 18:09.907
You smiling? You Sm... Oh, my God.

18:09.908 --> 18:12.043
Are you smiling for real?
I can't believe you.

18:17.802 --> 18:20.170
Lucious, you had one job.

18:20.171 --> 18:21.605
One job.

18:21.606 --> 18:23.440
You keep asking me to come back,

18:23.441 --> 18:27.611
but you can't even do
what I ask you to do, Lucious.

18:27.612 --> 18:30.869
I don't want this, I need ginger
ale. I can't drink that mess.

18:31.936 --> 18:33.617
I been telling you, we
don't need them bitches.

18:33.618 --> 18:35.252
It's not about them.

18:35.253 --> 18:39.123
It's about me always doing
something for you,

18:39.124 --> 18:41.759
but when I ask you to
do something for me, you...

18:41.760 --> 18:43.293
All you got is excuses.

18:43.294 --> 18:44.495
That ain't true.

18:44.496 --> 18:46.096
Those bitches are somewhere

18:46.097 --> 18:49.333
recording a diss track right now
with some other label.

18:49.334 --> 18:51.468
A diss track that we can't even keep

18:51.469 --> 18:53.671
Kelly Patel from hearing.

18:53.672 --> 18:57.013
Just when I was five minutes
from solving one problem,

18:57.014 --> 18:59.149
we got another one, thanks to you.

18:59.150 --> 19:00.417
I've been solving problems
over here at Empire

19:00.418 --> 19:02.118
for 20 years.

19:02.119 --> 19:04.955
I don't need somebody to tell me
how to do my business.

19:04.956 --> 19:07.457
Your business.
I can't with you, Lucious.

19:07.458 --> 19:11.461
You know what, this whole ordeal
got me so nauseous.

19:11.462 --> 19:13.763
No worries. Me and Eddie
will call those girls tomorrow

19:13.764 --> 19:15.332
to fix your mess.

19:15.333 --> 19:17.600
But you better pray that they are

19:17.601 --> 19:19.869
calm, because if not,
this Kelly Patel deal is dead.

19:19.870 --> 19:21.571
Ain't nothing dead, baby.

19:21.572 --> 19:23.974
And I'm gonna show you how
to get this thing done

19:23.975 --> 19:26.609
the old-fashioned Empire way.

19:46.697 --> 19:49.165
Sorry, I thought it was empty.
I'll go.

19:49.166 --> 19:50.266
You don't have to go.

19:52.336 --> 19:54.437
I ain't really working.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.842
Yeah, I heard that you
dropped out of the showcase.

19:58.843 --> 20:00.010
You okay?

20:00.011 --> 20:02.846
Sit down.

20:06.550 --> 20:10.453
Yeah, I just...

20:10.454 --> 20:13.156
feel, like, radioactive
around here now.

20:14.692 --> 20:16.359
Well,

20:16.360 --> 20:19.562
I...

20:19.563 --> 20:21.664
am pregnant.

20:24.368 --> 20:26.803
- Yeah.
- Becky.

20:28.272 --> 20:29.939
Mm, no.

20:33.677 --> 20:35.612
What'd J Poppa say?

20:39.517 --> 20:42.252
You didn't tell him?

20:42.253 --> 20:44.888
No, he's just...

20:44.889 --> 20:46.923
he's just so extra-Christian.

20:48.392 --> 20:50.560
If I told him,
he would want me to have it.

20:50.561 --> 20:53.730
Oh, I see.

20:53.731 --> 20:55.165
Yeah.

20:55.166 --> 20:58.101
Got it. So, you don't want it?

20:58.102 --> 21:02.005
I really don't know what I want.

21:02.006 --> 21:03.606
You know, I...

21:03.607 --> 21:06.576
I dreamed about exactly everything

21:06.577 --> 21:10.547
- that's finally happening for me.
- I know.

21:10.548 --> 21:12.682
And it's just the beginning.

21:12.683 --> 21:14.984
And...

21:14.985 --> 21:16.986
I worked really hard to get here.

21:16.987 --> 21:18.621
And I am so sorry,

21:18.622 --> 21:21.591
my emotions are just everywhere.

21:21.592 --> 21:23.993
And I-I know that we haven't
talked in a really long time,

21:23.994 --> 21:25.462
but I really, really missed you,

21:25.463 --> 21:26.896
and I didn't know how to tell you,

21:26.897 --> 21:28.765
but you were the only one
I wanted to talk to.

21:28.766 --> 21:32.202
Aw... come here. Come here.

21:32.203 --> 21:35.371
- I love you.
- I love you just as much.

You see? Hard work pays off.

21:54.125 --> 21:56.059
Thank you, Eddie.

21:56.060 --> 21:58.061
All right, this is what
we're gonna do. The VMAs

21:58.062 --> 21:59.462
are gonna be the coming out party

21:59.463 --> 22:01.264
for your new look and your new sound.

22:01.265 --> 22:03.066
Gonna book you on a worldwide tour.

22:03.067 --> 22:05.602
- Kimmel, Fallon, and Colbert.
- Oh, what?

22:05.603 --> 22:08.104
But you're gonna have to be all in.

22:08.105 --> 22:11.608
You're gonna have to eat,
sleep and breathe music.

22:11.609 --> 22:14.344
I am so grateful.

22:14.345 --> 22:15.778
I'm all in.

22:15.779 --> 22:18.047
Are you sure about that?

22:18.048 --> 22:20.850
'Cause I saw you lip-locked
at the rehearsal with Hakeem.

22:20.851 --> 22:22.819
I couldn't believe it.

22:22.820 --> 22:24.087
Tiana.

22:24.088 --> 22:25.755
Tiana, look at me.

22:25.756 --> 22:27.757
You don't got time to be distracted.

22:27.758 --> 22:30.093
Got room for only one man
in your life,

22:30.094 --> 22:33.029
and he's sitting right
in front of you.

22:33.030 --> 22:34.931
You understand?

22:42.907 --> 22:45.141
- Mr. Lyon?
- Yes?

22:45.142 --> 22:46.509
The ladies are here.

22:46.510 --> 22:48.511
Oh. Please send them in.

22:49.947 --> 22:51.848
Ladies, thank you so much for coming.

22:51.849 --> 22:53.082
Please have a seat.

22:55.719 --> 22:59.389
So, they tell us we're
finally getting a royalty check.

22:59.390 --> 23:01.891
Ladies, you know Phil Weiss.
He's the owner

23:01.892 --> 23:04.394
of Righteous Records.

23:04.395 --> 23:06.763
I see what this is.

23:06.764 --> 23:08.865
Now that we have a label deal,

23:08.866 --> 23:10.366
you want to apologize for real?

23:10.367 --> 23:12.068
Well, it's too late.

23:12.069 --> 23:13.369
Hey, sticky fingers,

23:13.370 --> 23:14.904
this ain't the dentist's office.

23:14.905 --> 23:16.306
Put those back.

23:17.341 --> 23:19.943
And you, my friend, you need

23:19.944 --> 23:22.212
to pull back on that divatude,
'cause I think

23:22.213 --> 23:23.980
- you got it twisted.
- I'd like to say

23:23.981 --> 23:26.716
that, after a brief but...

23:26.717 --> 23:31.421
healthy negotiation, Empire
has acquired Mr. Weiss's label.

23:31.422 --> 23:34.357
- It was a lot of money, girls.
- Wait...

23:34.358 --> 23:37.860
- So what does that mean for us?
- It means we own yo' ass.

23:37.861 --> 23:39.128
But we have a contract.

23:39.129 --> 23:42.265
Which is now the property of Empire.

23:42.266 --> 23:44.534
Your name, performing right,

23:44.535 --> 23:46.569
and copyright now belong to us.

23:46.570 --> 23:49.439
- I'm-a call our lawyer.
- His punk ass

23:49.440 --> 23:52.942
is on Empire's payroll as well.

23:52.943 --> 23:54.611
Now, effective immediately,

23:54.612 --> 23:57.146
you three are not allowed
to perform at a car wash,

23:57.147 --> 23:59.749
a baby shower or a bar mitzvah

23:59.750 --> 24:02.385
without the express written permission

24:02.386 --> 24:04.654
of Empire Entertainment.

24:04.655 --> 24:06.556
This is how it's gonna work, Divas.

24:06.557 --> 24:08.758
You're gonna take back
that diss track immediately.

24:08.759 --> 24:10.793
And you're going to apologize,
and this is

24:10.794 --> 24:11.794
what you're gonna say.

24:11.795 --> 24:14.030
Come here. Word for word.

24:14.031 --> 24:16.532
So I'm gonna need you to memorize it.

24:16.533 --> 24:18.601
And you're gonna perform
at the showcase

24:18.602 --> 24:20.203
with smiles on your face.

24:20.204 --> 24:21.804
And if all goes well,

24:21.805 --> 24:25.241
we will keep our word
and give you your reunion album.

24:25.242 --> 24:27.343
See, I think you ladies still got it.

24:27.344 --> 24:29.946
And Empire will go all out,

24:29.947 --> 24:31.514
but you got to play nice.

24:31.515 --> 24:34.751
I think that's "check."

24:34.752 --> 24:36.286
Oh, and before you leave,

24:36.287 --> 24:40.156
will you be so kind
as to apologize to my queen?

24:40.157 --> 24:43.226
'Cause without Cookie,
there is no Empire.

24:50.267 --> 24:52.068
- Sorry, Cookie.
- Sorry.

24:52.069 --> 24:53.803
Accepted.

24:53.804 --> 24:55.605
Drag your ass to rehearsal.

24:55.606 --> 24:58.207
Uh, with smiles, ladies;

24:58.208 --> 25:00.610
we just saved your careers.

25:00.611 --> 25:04.080
I think that's "checkmate."

25:06.950 --> 25:08.918
It was great doing business
with your shady ass.

25:10.754 --> 25:12.355
Damn, that felt great.

25:12.356 --> 25:16.125
I will call Eddie,
and he can... call Kelly...

25:16.126 --> 25:17.293
Are you okay?

25:17.294 --> 25:20.463
Uh...

25:20.464 --> 25:22.632
I guess I'm just a little dizzy
from, um,

25:22.633 --> 25:25.301
inhaling all that smoke
from putting all the fires out.

25:25.302 --> 25:27.337
How many times have I told you
I'm back?

25:27.338 --> 25:28.838
Over a hundred.

25:28.839 --> 25:31.207
Yeah, well, I'm not
telling you anymore.

25:31.208 --> 25:33.676
I'm telling you we are back,
you and me.

25:33.677 --> 25:36.212
You need to remember
that we're a team.

25:36.213 --> 25:37.880
Can't be doing deals without me.

25:37.881 --> 25:40.917
Me, remember Cookie Lyon?

25:42.553 --> 25:44.053
You're unforgettable.

25:44.054 --> 25:46.289
I know.

26:10.047 --> 26:11.581
Brother Andre?

26:18.122 --> 26:21.157
We've missed you, son.

26:22.459 --> 26:24.660
I reached out after Rhonda's passing.

26:25.829 --> 26:28.764
I didn't think I'd find
any comfort here.

26:31.835 --> 26:33.736
God betrayed me.

26:39.576 --> 26:43.146
God would never betray you, Andre.

26:43.147 --> 26:45.581
Mm.

26:45.582 --> 26:48.751
Why are you here, Andre?

26:48.752 --> 26:51.888
Family's having
a welcome home dinner for me.

26:51.889 --> 26:55.057
And the thought of them sitting there,

26:55.058 --> 26:57.293
smiling at me,

26:57.294 --> 27:01.197
after all I've done is hurt them...

27:05.836 --> 27:07.637
It's too much.

27:07.638 --> 27:10.473
What did you do?

27:10.474 --> 27:13.075
Mm.

27:14.545 --> 27:17.413
Excuse me.

27:17.414 --> 27:20.950
If you can't confess your sins to God,

27:20.951 --> 27:24.253
then confess to those you've harmed.

27:24.254 --> 27:27.290
It'll make you whole again.

27:27.291 --> 27:30.893
What if I don't deserve
to be whole again?

27:43.520 --> 27:47.322
Thank y'all for coming
to the 20 For 20 Showcase!

27:47.323 --> 27:51.059
Yes! Are you ready
for some more Empire music?!

27:51.060 --> 27:53.929
I got a surprise for y'all.

27:53.930 --> 27:56.231
Do y'all remember
the Three Black Divas?

27:56.232 --> 27:58.700
Well, baby, they are back!

27:58.701 --> 28:01.637
And they are bigger and better

Look who's out the nuthouse.

29:09.239 --> 29:11.573
I'm surprised the doctors
released your ass so quickly.

29:11.574 --> 29:13.742
What do you want, Shine?

29:13.743 --> 29:15.511
I just want to make sure

29:15.512 --> 29:17.579
my name's not coming
out of your mouth.

29:20.283 --> 29:21.984
Our arrangement still stands.

29:21.985 --> 29:25.754
I'll handle my business,
and... you handle yours.

29:28.558 --> 29:31.793
Who's ready for more 20 For 20?

29:31.794 --> 29:36.198
Yeah, next up, give it up for J Poppa!

29:41.838 --> 29:45.274
You know, you're my ride or die, T.

29:45.275 --> 29:48.844
Me and Bella, can't imagine
no days without you.

29:56.953 --> 29:59.154
So, uh...

30:05.695 --> 30:07.996
Will you marry me?

30:07.997 --> 30:09.731
Oh, my God.

30:12.468 --> 30:14.369
Oh, my God.

30:14.370 --> 30:16.672
Um...

30:16.673 --> 30:20.208
Keem, you know I've never
loved anyone until I met you.

30:20.209 --> 30:22.411
And...

30:22.412 --> 30:25.147
I love Bella like she's my own.

30:25.148 --> 30:27.382
Then say yes.

30:27.383 --> 30:30.052
But we just made up.

30:30.053 --> 30:32.120
I-I need time to think about this.

30:32.121 --> 30:33.655
Think about?

30:33.656 --> 30:36.324
What you need to think about?

30:38.328 --> 30:41.063
I can't have any
distractions right now.

30:41.064 --> 30:42.998
This ain't a distraction.

30:44.968 --> 30:47.069
I'm sorry, Keem.

30:54.077 --> 30:55.243
There she go.

30:55.244 --> 30:56.478
Look at you, baby.

30:56.479 --> 30:57.879
I didn't know you were here.

30:57.880 --> 31:01.249
Did you hear 'em out there
like, "J Poppa!"

31:01.250 --> 31:03.085
I got to talk to you, okay?

31:03.086 --> 31:05.687
What is it, baby? Huh?

31:05.688 --> 31:08.523
You know,
we both have so much going on.

31:08.524 --> 31:10.392
With your career and my career.

31:10.393 --> 31:12.427
Yeah, it's great, right?

31:12.428 --> 31:14.896
We're both rolling together
like we should be.

31:14.897 --> 31:17.833
No, no, no. You are not hearing me.

31:20.703 --> 31:24.172
Sometimes you meet the right person,

31:24.173 --> 31:27.275
but at the wrong time.

31:27.276 --> 31:29.578
Screw timing. All right?

31:29.579 --> 31:32.981
Do I look like I care about timing?

31:37.754 --> 31:40.188
- I'm in love with you.
- No, please.

31:40.189 --> 31:42.858
I cannot do this.

31:42.859 --> 31:45.560
I don't think that we should see
each other anymore, and so...

31:45.561 --> 31:46.795
No.

31:46.796 --> 31:49.765
Please don't make this hard.

31:49.766 --> 31:53.101
I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.

31:53.102 --> 31:55.737
Becky. Becky.

31:57.340 --> 31:58.707
- At least ten percent.
- Uh, ten percent.

31:58.708 --> 31:59.708
- Ten percent.
- Oh.

31:59.709 --> 32:00.709
Well, here's to ten percent.

32:00.710 --> 32:01.710
Here's to ten percent.

32:05.248 --> 32:08.683
If only all of our partnership
launches went this smoothly.

32:10.319 --> 32:13.989
Look at that.
Both companies up double digits

32:13.990 --> 32:16.324
in after-hours trading.

32:16.325 --> 32:17.959
The Street loves this deal.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.127
It's a natural fit.

32:20.563 --> 32:22.864
I don't mind saying, I'm excited.

32:22.865 --> 32:24.432
Me, too.

32:27.770 --> 32:30.305
So, you're ready
to move forward, then?

32:32.809 --> 32:36.144
When do we tell the Lyons
that I'm buying Empire?

32:37.313 --> 32:39.347
Leave the Lyons to me.

32:39.348 --> 32:42.317
Well...

32:42.318 --> 32:45.120
I have a board meeting

32:45.121 --> 32:47.422
in Palo Alto at 7:00 tomorrow, so...

32:47.423 --> 32:48.857
Always a pleasure.

32:48.858 --> 32:50.592
My love.

32:50.593 --> 32:52.727
- So good to see you.
- You, too.

32:57.433 --> 32:58.633
Yes! All right.

32:58.634 --> 32:59.634
That's what I'm talking about.

32:59.635 --> 33:00.635
Mm.

33:00.636 --> 33:03.205
I forgot how fun you were.

33:03.206 --> 33:06.742
Daddy's gonna get you all the
money you want, and then some.

33:06.743 --> 33:09.411
Pour me some more champagne.

33:09.412 --> 33:11.479
Oh.

33:12.782 --> 33:13.915
But don't stop.

33:18.020 --> 33:19.521
To Andre.

33:19.522 --> 33:21.223
Like the Lyon you are,

33:21.224 --> 33:23.625
- you roared your way back to life.
- Champagne?

33:23.626 --> 33:25.660
To you, Andre.

33:25.661 --> 33:27.321
- To Dre.
- Dre.

33:29.699 --> 33:31.333
You know, your father
and I have been talking,

33:31.334 --> 33:33.535
and we want you to know
that nothing's going to change.

33:33.536 --> 33:35.437
We still believe in you.

33:35.438 --> 33:38.173
So, at the appropriate time,
your mother and I are still

33:38.174 --> 33:40.776
going to hand the business over to you

33:40.777 --> 33:42.477
and you will have the reins of Empire.

33:42.478 --> 33:44.579
Just like we discussed in Vegas.

33:44.580 --> 33:46.314
Yeah, but-but that was before.

33:46.315 --> 33:47.582
Like we said, no time soon.

33:47.583 --> 33:49.684
But when you're ready...

33:50.720 --> 33:53.021
...you deserve it.

33:53.022 --> 33:54.456
Yeah, so shut up, Dre.

33:54.457 --> 33:56.091
- Yeah, you the one.
- Yes, indeed.

33:57.927 --> 33:59.060
What's wrong?

33:59.061 --> 34:00.395
- Nothing.
- Dinner is served.

34:00.396 --> 34:03.031
Yeah, let's eat.

34:03.032 --> 34:05.901
You followed my recipe
for that mac and cheese, right?

34:05.902 --> 34:07.402
Yes, Miss Cookie, I did.

34:07.403 --> 34:09.838
Then it should be good.

34:16.748 --> 34:18.850
Um...

34:18.851 --> 34:22.487
this is supposed to be a celebration.

34:22.487 --> 34:24.856
Why all the long faces?

34:24.857 --> 34:27.259
Jamal, what's wrong with you?

34:27.260 --> 34:29.226
- Mom, nothing, I'm eating.
- Boy.

34:29.228 --> 34:31.396
I mean, I don't really
appreciate being benched.

34:31.397 --> 34:32.697
Well, that's funny coming
from you; you're the one

34:32.699 --> 34:33.931
that asked to sit out today.

34:33.933 --> 34:35.766
The deal went through, anyway, Jamal.

34:35.768 --> 34:38.704
Pick your lip up. Hakeem,
what's your damn problem?

34:38.705 --> 34:40.505
I asked Tiana to marry me.

34:41.440 --> 34:42.574
Lord Jesus.

34:42.574 --> 34:44.109
Well, I guess y'all talking again.

34:44.110 --> 34:47.344
I love her,
and now that I got Bella back,

34:47.346 --> 34:49.147
- I'm ready to lock it down.
- You know what?

34:49.148 --> 34:50.815
- I, for one, approve.
- Okay.

34:50.817 --> 34:53.085
Let's just find out what she said.

34:53.085 --> 34:55.920
- Hakeem.
- She said she had to think about it.

34:55.922 --> 34:57.355
Oh.

34:59.225 --> 35:00.725
What? Why everybody made that face?

35:03.362 --> 35:05.964
Baby, sometimes when people
say they'll think about it,

35:05.965 --> 35:09.000
it's just a... a nicer way to say no.

35:11.070 --> 35:12.871
Really?

35:12.872 --> 35:14.639
But if two people
are destined to be together,

35:14.640 --> 35:17.809
then you'll find your way.
Keep your head up, Hakeem.

35:17.810 --> 35:19.244
Nice cleanup.

35:19.245 --> 35:21.480
Andre.

35:21.481 --> 35:23.381
This party's for you.

35:23.382 --> 35:24.783
You haven't touched your food.

35:24.784 --> 35:28.753
Uh, Pop, may I have a word with you?

35:30.123 --> 35:32.023
In private?

35:32.024 --> 35:34.559
Of course.

35:48.407 --> 35:52.978
I-I w-went to church today.

35:52.979 --> 35:54.946
Tried to make peace.

35:56.949 --> 35:59.217
I know what it's...

35:59.218 --> 36:02.921
what it feels like to feel incomplete.

36:04.090 --> 36:06.057
I mean, ever since the explosion,

36:06.058 --> 36:09.461
losing my leg, and my mind,

36:09.462 --> 36:11.963
I keep having these dreams,
you know...

36:11.964 --> 36:14.199
more like nightmares...

36:14.200 --> 36:17.002
where I'm trying to...

36:17.003 --> 36:19.905
put all the pieces together.

36:19.906 --> 36:23.708
But it's like this puzzle, it seems...

36:23.709 --> 36:25.710
like something's missing.

36:25.711 --> 36:27.879
That's what I want
to talk to you about, Pop.

36:27.880 --> 36:29.614
Yeah, I know, um...

36:29.615 --> 36:32.551
Thirsty said that Giuliana

36:32.552 --> 36:35.253
was overheard threatening me

36:35.254 --> 36:38.523
before the explosion.

36:38.524 --> 36:40.692
Now, I know Giuliana.

36:40.693 --> 36:44.496
But a car bomb... that's-that's
too complicated for her.

36:44.497 --> 36:49.501
That takes somebody
a little more cunning.

36:49.502 --> 36:52.137
More calculating.

36:55.141 --> 36:56.808
I need to tell you something.

36:58.878 --> 37:02.514
I've been keeping this from you.

37:02.515 --> 37:04.783
I can't keep it anymore.

37:04.784 --> 37:06.818
It's okay.

37:06.819 --> 37:09.020
Just say it.

37:09.021 --> 37:12.924
The reason that you almost died,

37:12.925 --> 37:15.794
the car bomb...

37:18.197 --> 37:19.898
...it was me.

37:29.508 --> 37:32.344
It was you?

37:32.345 --> 37:34.479
You planted the bomb?

37:34.480 --> 37:37.282
Yeah.

37:37.283 --> 37:40.418
I tried to call it off, Pop.

37:42.755 --> 37:45.257
I wanted to believe

37:45.258 --> 37:49.060
that love made me save you,

37:49.061 --> 37:52.364
but I know the real reason is
because you gave me the company.

38:16.989 --> 38:20.091
I made my peace, Pop.

38:23.329 --> 38:25.830
You do what you have to do.

38:25.831 --> 38:28.767
I won't stop you.

38:28.768 --> 38:30.502
I'm sorry.

38:35.975 --> 38:38.510
Are you out of your mind?!
What the hell is...?

38:38.511 --> 38:40.378
You almost killed your mother!

38:40.379 --> 38:41.947
You almost killed your mother!

38:41.948 --> 38:43.682
- What is happening?!
- Dad!

38:43.683 --> 38:45.984
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- He's got a gun.

38:45.985 --> 38:47.652
- Dad!
- You almost killed your mother!

38:47.653 --> 38:49.120
- It was him!
- Get off of him!

38:49.121 --> 38:50.488
It was him!

38:50.489 --> 38:52.023
- It was him!
- Get him out of here!

38:52.024 --> 38:53.358
It was him!

38:55.661 --> 38:57.228
It was him!

38:57.229 --> 39:00.031
"It was him," what, baby?

39:00.032 --> 39:02.634
He tried to blow you up.

39:02.635 --> 39:04.035
He tried to kill us.

39:06.505 --> 39:09.341
Okay. Okay.

39:11.477 --> 39:13.578
It was him.

39:15.881 --> 39:18.650
It was him.

39:19.780 --> 39:23.049
My beautiful little boy...

39:23.050 --> 39:25.395
tried to kill me because

39:25.396 --> 39:27.764
I wouldn't give him my Empire.

39:27.765 --> 39:30.767
He's not well, Lucious.

39:30.768 --> 39:32.569
He's sick.

39:32.570 --> 39:34.571
I know that.

39:34.572 --> 39:37.908
That's why he's still alive.

39:39.610 --> 39:42.279
He planned this, Cookie.

39:42.280 --> 39:45.715
He almost killed you,
and that's why I'm so angry.

39:45.716 --> 39:48.451
You don't think
I'm angry, Lucious? Huh?

39:48.452 --> 39:52.255
I mean, if this is true,

39:52.256 --> 39:54.958
then I'm-I'm just
as heartbroken as you.

39:54.959 --> 39:56.326
Wait, wait, "If"?

39:56.327 --> 39:58.828
He admitted it.

39:58.829 --> 40:01.331
Don't you know, for the rest
of my life, every step I take,

40:01.332 --> 40:04.935
I'm reminded that my...

40:04.936 --> 40:08.038
my boy wanted me dead.

40:17.114 --> 40:18.748
All right, man, keep it 100.

40:18.749 --> 40:22.686
Tell us those pills
ain't out your system yet.

40:22.687 --> 40:25.956
What, so he imagined this, too,
like his girlfriend?

40:25.957 --> 40:27.991
No, it's real.

40:29.493 --> 40:32.796
I did it.

40:34.665 --> 40:36.199
We grew up in a violent crib.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.301
Dad was shady as hell.

40:38.302 --> 40:39.569
Oh, so Lucious made him do it?

40:39.570 --> 40:40.937
Look, that's not what I'm saying.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.606
I'm just trying to make sense
of this mess.

40:42.607 --> 40:45.275
You know, one time,
Lucious put a gun in my hand...

40:46.577 --> 40:48.645
- ...and told me to shoot him.
- You know what, man?

40:48.646 --> 40:51.448
We could sit here all day
sharing evil Lucious stories.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.617
The son of a bitch threw me
in a trash can when I was a kid.

40:53.618 --> 40:55.018
He made me marry a girl...
blah, blah, blah.

40:55.019 --> 40:56.486
Put it in a damn song.

40:56.487 --> 40:58.888
I went to sleep a thousand
and one nights dreaming

40:58.889 --> 41:01.725
about putting a cap in his ass,
but I didn't.

41:01.726 --> 41:03.893
You want to know why? Because
you don't kill your father!

41:03.894 --> 41:05.862
Okay.

41:05.863 --> 41:09.833
Look, man, if I could-if I could
take it all back,

41:09.834 --> 41:12.035
and-and give up my leg for his,

41:12.036 --> 41:15.105
give up my life for his,
I'd do it... I can't!

41:18.276 --> 41:20.410
At least I told him.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.515
I told him.

41:25.516 --> 41:27.350
Yeah, at least.

41:27.351 --> 41:30.920
I guess you should just feel
all better about yourself now.

41:30.921 --> 41:32.622
I'm out of here.

41:35.226 --> 41:36.426
I don't know who you are,

41:36.427 --> 41:39.095
or what you turned into,

41:39.096 --> 41:41.598
but somebody stole our big brother.

41:47.872 --> 41:49.773
I don't know what to do with him.

41:49.774 --> 41:53.743
If you love me like you say
you do, Lucious, just...

41:53.744 --> 41:56.546
please, don't hurt him.

41:56.547 --> 41:59.516
I'm just so disappointed
because I don't...

41:59.517 --> 42:02.018
I don't know our boy.

42:02.019 --> 42:03.186
Who is he?

42:03.187 --> 42:04.621
Well, don't act like

42:04.622 --> 42:07.357
we don't have blood on our hands.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.926
Hey, this ain't on us.

42:09.927 --> 42:12.228
We had nothing to do with this.

42:12.229 --> 42:14.197
Are you sure? Huh?

42:14.198 --> 42:16.132
Because you pitted your sons
against each other

42:16.133 --> 42:17.967
when you thought you was gonna die.

42:17.968 --> 42:20.570
Yeah, but that was then, I mean,
and we worked past that, babe,

42:20.571 --> 42:22.572
we... we were gonna
be a family, and now,

42:22.573 --> 42:24.574
how in the hell
can we ever even imagine

42:24.575 --> 42:26.643
being a family again?

42:26.644 --> 42:28.578
He confessed, Lucious.

42:28.579 --> 42:30.246
Okay? That's a start.

42:30.247 --> 42:33.249
Maybe he-he's coming back
to his right mind.

42:33.250 --> 42:34.751
No, I think you living
in a fantasy, hon.

42:34.752 --> 42:37.320
My baby, my son...

42:37.321 --> 42:39.422
he's not capable...

42:39.423 --> 42:40.824
Lucious...

42:40.825 --> 42:42.459
Hey, you... Hey, hey.

42:42.460 --> 42:43.960
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

42:43.961 --> 42:45.762
Hey, baby, you okay?
Come here, come here.

42:45.763 --> 42:48.365
Come on, come on.
Are you okay? What's wrong?

42:48.366 --> 42:50.667
I... c-can't catch my breath.

42:50.668 --> 42:52.102
Juanita!

42:52.103 --> 42:54.838
- Hold on.
- My arm.

42:54.839 --> 42:56.506
- Hello?
- 911. What's your emergency?

42:56.507 --> 42:58.808
Hello. My wife, uh, um,
my wife... Something's wrong.

42:58.809 --> 43:00.410
I need an ambulance.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.391
I need an ambulance.
Please send an ambulance...
