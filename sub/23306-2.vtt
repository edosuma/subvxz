does count.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.128
- Frank.

32:02.211 --> 32:03.963
- It tells the story,
but you get towards

32:04.047 --> 32:06.007
<i>the back of that maze,</i>
<i>that line work is not precise.</i>

32:06.090 --> 32:09.761
<i>- Your whole scene is broken</i>
<i>apart and crumbly.</i>

32:09.844 --> 32:11.179
<i>Why not crumble</i>
<i>the lines in the maze</i>

32:11.262 --> 32:14.515
<i>and continue that rocky feel?</i>
- I didn't think about that.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.225
- And then, winner winner.

32:16.309 --> 32:18.561
- Matt.

32:18.645 --> 32:21.898
- The illustration's cool.

32:21.981 --> 32:23.775
<i>The overall quality of</i>
<i>the line work here</i>

32:23.858 --> 32:25.234

<i>and you needed</i>

32:25.318 --> 32:26.861
<i>to bump up that thickness,</i>

32:26.944 --> 32:28.946
so you really have
a beefy area to work off.

32:29.030 --> 32:30.031
- Yeah, I think I went
a little too thin

32:30.114 --> 32:31.991
with the outline.
- Yeah, it's a cool design,

32:32.075 --> 32:35.244
but it definitely
has some hiccups.

32:35.328 --> 32:36.871
- Sparks.

32:36.954 --> 32:39.874
- From a distance,
these colors together

32:39.957 --> 32:41.376
<i>just get pretty muddy looking.</i>

32:41.459 --> 32:43.336
- Too much black.
- There's a lot more light

32:43.419 --> 32:44.170
<i>that you could bring</i>
<i>into this thing.</i>

32:44.253 --> 32:46.714
- These colors standalone
are bright,

32:46.798 --> 32:49.884
but doing that much black
and having no air to breathe

32:49.967 --> 32:52.387
<i>gives it that muddy, stagnant,</i>
<i>solid feel.</i>

32:52.470 --> 32:53.554
You know what I mean?
- That's why I didn't

32:53.638 --> 32:54.555
wanna go, like, super nuts
with the color, but--

32:54.639 --> 32:55.890
- That's why we were talking
about no

32:55.973 --> 32:56.724
wall-to-wall saturation,
I mean, we went over

32:56.808 --> 32:58.101

32:58.184 --> 32:59.894
{\an3}I'm trying hard

33:13.825 --> 33:14.742

33:14.826 --> 33:17.912

of the day goes to Daniel.

33:27.004 --> 33:30.425
[all congratulating]

33:30.508 --> 33:32.051

33:32.135 --> 33:34.011
{\an1}now you must deliberate
and put one artist

33:34.095 --> 33:36.639

33:36.723 --> 33:42.019
Head back to the loft.

33:42.103 --> 33:44.522
- Was anyone, like,
super upset at their critique?

33:44.605 --> 33:45.648
- If I were Sparks,
I'd be pretty bummed out.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.525
I felt like his coach
didn't come to his aid

33:47.608 --> 33:49.944
the same way that he did
everyone else on his team.

33:50.027 --> 33:52.363
- Yeah, you straight
threw him under the bus.

33:52.447 --> 33:53.656

everybody else.

33:53.740 --> 33:54.365

33:54.449 --> 33:56.868

got [bleep] on.

33:56.951 --> 34:00.037
- Your first drawing would've
got torn apart 100 times more.

34:00.121 --> 34:02.457
- I didn't even get to
finish my drawing, DJ.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.041
- You didn't have to.
- I was halfway through it,

34:04.125 --> 34:05.209
and you were like,
no, no, no.

34:05.293 --> 34:06.836

to my first piece of advice

34:06.919 --> 34:08.170
while we were drawing.

34:08.254 --> 34:08.629

34:08.713 --> 34:09.964
my [bleep], dude.

34:10.047 --> 34:12.257
I don't look at [bleep]
just to copy it.

34:12.341 --> 34:13.592
- But you look at stuff
for reference.

34:13.676 --> 34:14.969
- After I get
the original idea down.

34:15.052 --> 34:15.594
Yeah, I clean it up.

34:15.678 --> 34:17.346
- [bleep] backwards, man.

how I work.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.099

I don't draw like you,
I don't work like you.

34:21.809 --> 34:22.601
And then I'm taking your advice
in the simplest thing.

- No, [bleep] that, dude.
