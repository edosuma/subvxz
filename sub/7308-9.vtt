WEBVTT

00:09.676 --> 00:11.553
lt's called Shroomsville
because the guys think

00:11.720 --> 00:13.305
these reeds
look like little mushrooms.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.098
Or they were on mushrooms.

00:22.606 --> 00:24.858
Hey. You're not supposed
to be lighting fires out here.

00:25.025 --> 00:28.487
lt's against base rules.
Let's go, kids. Let's go home.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.366
You too, miss. Let's go.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.285
Last one out has to douse the fire.

01:33.169 --> 01:34.420
Oh, yeah, baby.

01:34.587 --> 01:37.507
Oh, come on.

01:38.674 --> 01:41.677
Come on, come on.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.014
l'm trying to concentrate.

01:45.264 --> 01:47.308
That makes two of us then,
doesn't it, Ziva?

01:47.517 --> 01:51.896
- ls it work-related?
- Of course it's work-related, Ziva.

01:52.105 --> 01:57.110
- JudgeMyTush.com?
- Hey, a little privacy here, probie.

02:03.533 --> 02:06.536
- l give it a four.
- Are you kidding? Four?

02:06.786 --> 02:09.372
Out of five, l think that's good.
lsn't it?

02:09.538 --> 02:11.332
Out of five.

02:12.792 --> 02:14.210
What do you think about this one?

02:16.003 --> 02:18.965
- Come on. Come on.
- l will not get involved with this further.

02:19.132 --> 02:20.883
Gibbs seems to always be
around the corner.

02:21.050 --> 02:23.136
- Give me a little something. Come on.
- No. No. No.

02:23.302 --> 02:24.971
What do you think? Rate it.

02:28.057 --> 02:30.727
- Fine. A two.
- A two?

02:32.103 --> 02:34.939
- A two?
- What's a two, DiNozzo?

02:35.106 --> 02:37.066
l was just explaining
the rules to Ziva, boss.

02:37.233 --> 02:39.068
And number two is what?

02:41.904 --> 02:44.991
- You know, l was a little fuzzy on two.
- Grab your gear.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.451
We're going to Quantico.

02:53.166 --> 02:54.375
Two.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.003
l took three points off
for excessive hair.

02:57.170 --> 02:58.588
l don't have--

02:59.964 --> 03:01.424
That's a five.

03:04.093 --> 03:05.928
lf you shave.

03:08.514 --> 03:10.349
Shave.

03:10.516 --> 03:12.727
Marines run tactics
through these woods every day, sir.

03:12.894 --> 03:14.103
What time yesterday?

03:14.270 --> 03:16.022
- 1 900.
- Ducky, where's Jimmy?

03:16.230 --> 03:18.066
Having a root canal.

03:18.274 --> 03:20.109
Allow me.

03:20.610 --> 03:22.278
Thank you.

03:24.280 --> 03:25.531
Thank you.

03:25.948 --> 03:27.700
Oh, watch your step.

03:27.867 --> 03:29.410
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:32.205 --> 03:33.581
Oh, let me give you a hand.

03:33.748 --> 03:36.334
No, no, no. lt's lovely
that chivalry is not dead, doctor.

03:36.501 --> 03:38.795
But in the army, l swam three miles
across the Red Sea

03:38.961 --> 03:42.215
after scaling rough cliffs
without safety lines.

03:42.382 --> 03:44.300
l believe l can manage.

03:49.806 --> 03:52.642
How refreshing.
An independent woman.

03:56.270 --> 04:00.316
They were under this bush here,
until l moved one to here.

04:02.068 --> 04:05.238
- The teenagers?
- Said they never noticed the legs.

04:06.322 --> 04:08.282
Tony, shoot. Ziva, bag and tag.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.826
- McGee, samples.
- Got it.

04:10.326 --> 04:13.538
Well, l'm afraid a liver temp
is out of the question.

04:13.746 --> 04:15.540
Well, talk to me, Duck.

04:15.707 --> 04:17.709
lt's very strange.

04:17.875 --> 04:21.254
The marbling on the skin
indicates advanced decomposition.

04:21.671 --> 04:26.092
But the complete lack of insect activity
on the moist area of the open thigh

04:26.300 --> 04:28.302
indicates a cessation of decay.

04:28.511 --> 04:30.012
Any idea how long?

04:30.179 --> 04:33.015
Well, the muscles have gone
through all three stages of rigor mortis,

04:33.182 --> 04:35.101
so that gives us at least 48 hours.

04:35.309 --> 04:38.813
But, Jethro,
the leg is in pristine condition,

04:39.021 --> 04:42.692
apparently untouched
by air, water, soil or insect.

04:42.942 --> 04:45.695
- Frozen?
- No ice crystals.

04:45.862 --> 04:47.405
Basement?

04:47.572 --> 04:50.283
Well, if that's the case,
we are dealing with a dark soul,

04:50.450 --> 04:53.286
one who kills, cuts and keeps.

04:58.374 --> 04:59.542
That's trash.

04:59.709 --> 05:01.210
l think l know
what l'm doing by now.

05:01.377 --> 05:04.672
Well, MREs and paint pellets,
say training area to me.

05:04.881 --> 05:07.383
No one has ever been killed
during training?

05:08.092 --> 05:11.137
You know, my forensic instructor
back at FLETC

05:11.304 --> 05:14.682
once planted a pregnancy test
at a crime scene to test us.

05:14.891 --> 05:17.643
That's nice, probie.
But in my years as an investigator,

05:17.852 --> 05:22.356
l've learned that trash indigenous
to an area is not worth collecting.

05:22.732 --> 05:25.818
What if because l did not bag
and tag this trash,

05:25.985 --> 05:27.570
l happened to miss this?

05:28.821 --> 05:30.907
The finger of a rubber glove.

05:33.826 --> 05:36.412
l didn't say don't look
under indigenous stuff.

05:37.246 --> 05:40.333
- l think we're almost done here.
- No, l don't think so.

05:40.541 --> 05:43.002
l want every paper, projectile,

05:43.169 --> 05:46.255
stomped-on leaf
within a ten-foot radius of both legs.

05:50.760 --> 05:54.180
l'll bet Tony made some unseemly
comment about these legs, didn't he?

05:54.389 --> 05:56.140
Why would he do that, Mr. Palmer?

05:56.349 --> 05:59.936
l just mean knowing Tony--

06:00.520 --> 06:02.271
They're fairly shapely legs, doctor.

06:02.438 --> 06:08.111
Yes, nobody had the bad taste
to verbalize such a thought until now.

06:08.277 --> 06:09.570
Now that you
come to mention it,

06:09.737 --> 06:12.240
they do look remarkably similar
to Betty Grable's.

06:12.407 --> 06:13.616
Betty--?

06:13.783 --> 06:16.202
One of the all-time pin-up gals
of the '40s.

06:16.369 --> 06:18.663
- Yeah, great gams.
- Gams?

06:18.830 --> 06:21.791
Aren't you a little young
to remember Betty Grable, Jethro?

06:21.958 --> 06:24.544
My dad had her painted on the nose
of his P-51 , Duck.

06:24.711 --> 06:26.379
- A P-51 ?
- Up to Abby.

06:26.546 --> 06:27.964
- Quick as you can.
- Yes, doctor.

06:28.131 --> 06:29.549
What do we know
about our Jane Doe?

06:29.716 --> 06:31.968
She was young.
Look at the femur here.

06:32.218 --> 06:35.430
lt's one of the last bones in the body
to develop fully.

06:35.638 --> 06:38.808
ln the female,
growth is complete around age 25.

06:38.975 --> 06:42.687
l'd say our victim
was between 1 9 and 21 .

06:42.854 --> 06:45.565
- lD?
- Without a toeprint database,

06:45.732 --> 06:48.818
l'm afraid we'll just have to rely
on good old DNA.

06:50.319 --> 06:52.196
What about the splotch
on her calf, Duck?

06:52.363 --> 06:54.157
Blood. l'd say the assailant's.

06:54.323 --> 06:58.369
lt's on its way up
to Abby's mass spectrometer.

06:58.536 --> 07:00.121
- Couldn't be hers?
- lt could be.

07:00.288 --> 07:03.082
But she was dead
long before she was dissected.

07:03.249 --> 07:05.001
Blood no longer pulsed
through her veins,

07:05.209 --> 07:07.420
when, what l would guess
was a surgical saw,

07:07.587 --> 07:10.465
severed her thighs from her torso.

07:10.673 --> 07:13.843
Now, look, see how my glove
sticks here?

07:14.093 --> 07:17.013
Also headed up
to the mass spectrometer.

07:17.180 --> 07:19.348
Yes, but take a look at this.

07:20.683 --> 07:25.354
- Skin's been removed.
- Yes. A meticulously cut circle.

07:25.521 --> 07:26.773
Strange keepsake.

07:26.981 --> 07:30.359
Actually, l think it was the killer
trying to remove his marks.

07:30.526 --> 07:32.695
Like all sex killers after Bundy?

07:32.862 --> 07:34.947
Yes, after Theodore Bundy

07:35.156 --> 07:38.743
was identified and caught
by his crooked lower teeth,

07:38.951 --> 07:42.997
sadistic biters have been forced
to excise their evidence.

07:43.206 --> 07:47.001
You know, l think l might be able
to get an impression of teeth

07:47.210 --> 07:50.880
from the underlying damaged tissue.

07:51.047 --> 07:53.132
You could get me a bite mark?

07:53.299 --> 07:55.218
l could try.

07:59.389 --> 08:01.307
l have some samples for Abby.

08:01.474 --> 08:03.393
That's convenient,
because l'm Abby's assistant.

08:03.559 --> 08:04.769
l wanted to say hi.

08:04.936 --> 08:08.272
- l haven't seen her in a while.
- She's really busy right now.

08:08.439 --> 08:09.732
lt'll only take a minute.

08:10.483 --> 08:12.402
You haven't been an assistant
for very long.

08:13.027 --> 08:15.696
- Longer than you.
- We'll see about that.

08:15.905 --> 08:17.490
That doesn't make any sense, Chip.

08:19.992 --> 08:21.994
lt's Charles.

08:22.912 --> 08:24.580
Charles.

08:24.747 --> 08:26.749
lt's an evidence showcase
showdown, Chip.

08:27.417 --> 08:31.754
What do you prefer? Possible prints,
sticky stuff, or name that blood?

08:31.921 --> 08:33.756
Well, l aced serology.

08:33.923 --> 08:36.426
l was a dilettante
with fingerprint identification, so--

08:36.926 --> 08:39.010
Name the sticky stuff
for a hundred, Chip.

08:40.263 --> 08:41.556
For a Caucasian female,

08:41.722 --> 08:45.017
a factor of 2.90
is multiplied by the tibia length.

08:45.226 --> 08:49.772
Okay, autopsy report says
tibia is 38.34 centimetres.

08:49.939 --> 08:52.442
- What are you doing?
- We are calculating our Jane Doe's

08:52.608 --> 08:55.111
- probable height and weight.
- Why didn't you ask me?

08:55.278 --> 08:57.780
Tony, these are complex equations
we're dealing with.

08:57.947 --> 08:59.991
Whatever. She was, what, 5'8''.

09:00.158 --> 09:03.745
So she's like 1 25, 1 26 pounds. Hey.

09:04.954 --> 09:09.042
Okay, 1 1 1 .1 86 for adipose.
Density of musculature--

09:09.208 --> 09:11.085
That's 61 .53.

09:11.294 --> 09:13.713
1 72.72 centimetres for height.

09:13.880 --> 09:17.133
Ducky estimates
57.08 kilograms in weight.

09:17.300 --> 09:19.385
Converting to imperial,
and we're done.

09:20.887 --> 09:24.390
- She's 5-foot-8.
- 1 25 and a half pounds?

09:30.730 --> 09:32.190
This doesn't make any sense.

09:34.025 --> 09:35.735
You're grumbling.

09:35.902 --> 09:38.488
Well, l know.
l can't read Ziva's writing.

09:41.657 --> 09:43.785
lt looks perfectly clear to me.

09:44.827 --> 09:46.788
You've got to loosen up, Chip.

09:46.996 --> 09:49.999
Evidence is fun. Fun?

09:50.166 --> 09:52.919
You know fun. Fun, Chip.

09:54.212 --> 09:56.881
- You're a tough case, Chip.
- Yeah, l know.

09:58.299 --> 10:00.843
Gibbs. All this evidence
and a Caf-Pow!

10:01.010 --> 10:02.887
- ls it my birthday?
- Pretend it's mine.

10:03.096 --> 10:06.974
Okay, here's what l have for you.
The blood on the calf is different

10:07.141 --> 10:10.311
from the victim's. l sent both off for
processing. But here's your real gift.

10:10.478 --> 10:12.855
l found a smudged print
on the tip of the glove finger

10:13.022 --> 10:15.191
and clarified it into a partial print.
Happy birthday.

10:15.441 --> 10:18.611
- Get a match.
- lt's running through AFlS now.

10:35.420 --> 10:38.256
l must have ripped a glove
at the scene, boss.

10:47.933 --> 10:50.268
Like l said, l must've ripped
a glove at the crime scene

10:50.435 --> 10:52.729
- some time before yesterday.
- When was the last time

10:52.896 --> 10:55.815
- you worked a crime scene there?
- Napolitano case, boss.

10:57.984 --> 11:01.279
The computer only found three points
from your fingerprint to the sample.

11:01.446 --> 11:03.073
Most prosecutors want 1 1 .

11:03.240 --> 11:06.993
Well, technically, Abby,
the minimum to go to court is one.

11:08.537 --> 11:12.832
Well, l'm just saying that, you know,
people have been convicted on less.

11:12.999 --> 11:15.544
Well, that's great, Chipper.
Team player.

11:16.044 --> 11:18.171
l'm gonna redo this by hand.

11:22.008 --> 11:24.177
You set this up, didn't you?

11:24.344 --> 11:28.807
l would never.
Okay, maybe l would, but l didn't.

11:31.893 --> 11:34.437
- lt matches Tony.
- Put a rush on those blood samples.

11:34.604 --> 11:37.357
- l did. But it's a 1 6-hour turnaround.
- Make it 1 2.

11:40.110 --> 11:43.405
When's the last time
you were at the dentist?

11:44.531 --> 11:45.866
Hold still.

11:48.118 --> 11:51.663
This is far faster
and more accurate than your x-rays.

11:56.877 --> 11:59.546
You're not known for your bedside
manner, are you there, Duck?

11:59.713 --> 12:01.715
You're just upset
that l didn't have peppermint.

12:03.258 --> 12:04.634
McGee.

12:09.306 --> 12:11.516
Here's Tony.

12:11.683 --> 12:13.894
The program uses laser scans
of 3-D objects

12:14.060 --> 12:16.438
to create 3-D images
for comparison.

12:16.605 --> 12:18.732
Computer-generated
hollow volume overlay.

12:18.899 --> 12:22.152
Measures inter-tooth spacing,
dental arc, tooth thickness.

12:22.319 --> 12:24.237
All right,
enough of the geek speak.

12:25.405 --> 12:27.741
Here's Ducky's muscle-tissue scan.

12:27.949 --> 12:30.202
A little 3-D magic for clarity.

12:30.410 --> 12:34.581
And l give you the killer's incisors.
Next step--

12:34.748 --> 12:38.418
And don't worry, Tony, the chances
of even one of your teeth matching

12:38.585 --> 12:41.254
are like 1 00,000 to 1 .

12:41.421 --> 12:42.631
Do it, Abby.

12:53.767 --> 12:55.977
Jethro, l know DiNozzo
didn't do this.

12:56.186 --> 12:59.606
But l also know
that it would be political suicide

12:59.773 --> 13:02.108
if we got caught investigating
one of our own agents.

13:02.317 --> 13:04.110
Appearances matter, Jethro.

13:04.277 --> 13:06.780
ln this world,
sometimes more than facts.

13:06.947 --> 13:11.159
lt could ruin the agency.
Look at Robert Novak and the ClA.

13:12.202 --> 13:15.247
You have a responsibility to your man,
l know that.

13:15.413 --> 13:18.625
But l have a responsibility
to the entire agency.

13:18.792 --> 13:21.711
- Jen--
- l'm not forgetting the time

13:21.878 --> 13:25.006
l stepped in it and you covered my ass
until l could get out of it,

13:25.173 --> 13:28.718
but that was alone, undercover,
and in the field.

13:28.885 --> 13:31.346
Half of NClS
already knows about this.

13:31.513 --> 13:35.350
l know what you have to do, Jethro,
and l won't stop you.

13:35.559 --> 13:36.810
But officially,

13:36.977 --> 13:40.063
l am suspending you
from investigating this further,

13:40.230 --> 13:43.483
- and l am turning it over to the FBl.
- l know.

13:44.985 --> 13:46.152
One request.

13:46.319 --> 13:48.655
l'll see that Fornell
runs the investigation.

13:50.198 --> 13:51.867
l always could read your mind.

13:59.207 --> 14:01.418
Not always, Jen.

14:03.378 --> 14:05.213
Still waiting on Jane Doe's DNA.

14:05.422 --> 14:08.133
Corporal at Quantico said there were
no missing female dependents

14:08.300 --> 14:10.010
- or UA Marines.
- Try the base hospital.

14:10.218 --> 14:12.971
l checked missing persons
for Maryland, Virginia and D.C.

14:13.179 --> 14:15.181
There were
a few similar descriptions.

14:15.348 --> 14:17.517
Their DNA is headed over now.

14:18.184 --> 14:19.436
- David Brant.
- Gibbs.

14:19.603 --> 14:21.104
l heard you were quitting.

14:21.271 --> 14:24.733
l like to refer to it as a lateral move
into the recreational sector, Jethro.

14:24.941 --> 14:26.192
l wish you luck with that.

14:26.359 --> 14:28.278
Lateral move
into the recreational sector?

14:28.486 --> 14:32.240
Yeah, it mostly means
fishing and hitting a golf ball.

14:32.449 --> 14:33.950
- DiNozzo?
- Yeah, boss.

14:34.117 --> 14:36.036
- What are you doing?
- Someone's setting me up.

14:36.203 --> 14:39.664
Two surgically removed legs
dumped into a training area.

14:39.831 --> 14:41.791
- Do you think?
- Yeah.

14:41.958 --> 14:44.502
l was trying to think
of arrestees with grudges.

14:44.711 --> 14:48.506
- Wouldn't they all have grudges?
- You see my dilemma.

14:48.673 --> 14:51.051
- Mike Macaluso?
- He's the Mafia boss

14:51.218 --> 14:53.887
- DiNozzo busted in Baltimore.
- They get touchy when they think

14:54.054 --> 14:55.889
of you as family
and you turn out to be a cop.

14:56.223 --> 14:58.558
What about that forensics dweeb
that you got fired?

14:58.725 --> 14:59.893
l didn't arrest him, Abby.

15:00.060 --> 15:02.562
Yeah, but you really, really,
really pissed him off.

15:02.729 --> 15:06.066
Forensic tech set a killer free when
he contaminated some blood samples.

15:06.233 --> 15:09.069
- Tony reported him.
- Good old George Stewart.

15:09.236 --> 15:11.321
You know,
maybe you should expand the list

15:11.488 --> 15:13.782
just to include people
that just hate you.

15:13.949 --> 15:16.743
- Hate me? Nobody hates me.
- Paula Cassidy.

15:17.285 --> 15:20.664
Don't go there.
People like me. l'm a nice guy.

15:20.872 --> 15:23.083
What about the woman
who posted your picture

15:23.250 --> 15:24.543
on the herpes-alert website?

15:24.751 --> 15:28.630
<i>- Lieutenant Pam Kim.
- She so went Fatal Attraction on you.</i>

15:28.797 --> 15:30.340
Boiled the bunny.

15:30.507 --> 15:32.342
Oh, don't forget about Mrs. Dean.

15:32.884 --> 15:35.428
- Another girlfriend?
- No, she threatened to cut off

15:35.595 --> 15:38.807
his...when Tony put her husband
away for murdering his first wife.

15:38.974 --> 15:43.603
Speaking about wives,
what about your ex-girlfriend Monica?

15:43.770 --> 15:47.023
l always break up with them
when l find out they're married, Ziva.

15:47.774 --> 15:50.527
Okay, all right. Thank you all,
but l think that's enough.

15:50.777 --> 15:52.612
The personnel
in the evidence garage?

15:52.779 --> 15:54.489
- What about them?
- They hate you.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.617
She's right. You never wait your turn
to check in evidence.

15:57.784 --> 16:03.290
And women don't appreciate
being called baggie bunnies.

16:04.583 --> 16:07.127
They're right, DiNozzo.
Eight years. Three different forces.

16:07.335 --> 16:09.796
That's a lot of names
and people to remember, boss.

16:09.963 --> 16:13.091
Ziva, take the women.
McGee, you take the men.

16:13.300 --> 16:16.428
l'll pull the case files of the ones
DiNozzo put away who are on the list.

16:16.636 --> 16:18.805
Wait a minute,
you never do anything.

16:19.180 --> 16:21.224
Because you're such
a good delegator.

16:21.850 --> 16:24.185
Oh, this is not good.

16:26.897 --> 16:28.148
Gibbs.

16:28.690 --> 16:30.150
DiNozzo.

16:30.358 --> 16:32.736
This is Special Agent Sacks.

16:40.243 --> 16:43.246
- He's being framed.
- l believe you.

16:43.455 --> 16:45.373
l've been there myself, Jethro.

16:45.832 --> 16:48.210
- l'll take care of him.
- l know.

16:48.376 --> 16:49.961
But l wanna be kept in the loop.

16:50.170 --> 16:52.339
Oh, now l'm hurt.
Are you saying you don't trust me?

16:53.465 --> 16:56.051
Whoever set this up, Tobias,
is a pro.

16:56.218 --> 16:59.846
lf this were to go to court right now,
DiNozzo would not stand a chance.

17:00.722 --> 17:03.892
Well, l gotta take him
into custody for questioning.

17:05.727 --> 17:09.439
Or l guess
we could question him here.

17:12.150 --> 17:14.736
Tony, Fornell's gonna question you.

17:14.903 --> 17:17.696
- You mean interrogate me.
- Question. Draw it out.

17:18.073 --> 17:19.616
After we talk to Agent DiNozzo,

17:19.782 --> 17:22.786
we'll need to requisition any evidence
involved in the case.

17:29.751 --> 17:32.087
- Are we covered on evidence?
- l'll just need a few hours

17:32.254 --> 17:34.798
to copy the data from Tony's
hard drive, cell phone--

17:34.965 --> 17:36.967
- l'll make duplicates.
- Have Ducky do the same.

17:37.133 --> 17:38.552
- What can l do?
- Help. Help Abby.

17:38.718 --> 17:40.971
Help McGee. Help Ducky.

17:43.890 --> 17:45.100
Where were you Tuesday night

17:45.267 --> 17:48.979
between 0900 and 0300
the next morning?

17:56.903 --> 17:58.280
Would that be Zulu time?

17:59.030 --> 18:01.074
Just run through your night.

18:01.241 --> 18:02.409
Okay.

18:07.706 --> 18:09.791
Oh, out loud. Right.

18:10.333 --> 18:14.504
Worked till 7, went for a run,
drove home.

18:14.713 --> 18:17.632
Spent the night alone,
which, l know, is unusual,

18:17.799 --> 18:21.928
<i>but it was a school night,
and l wanted to watch Magnum.</i>

18:22.929 --> 18:24.139
What was it about?

18:25.473 --> 18:28.268
The old checking-the-plot ploy.

18:28.435 --> 18:30.937
You're good, Agent Sacks.

18:31.146 --> 18:33.732
<i>Very good.
lt's my favourite Magnum.</i>

18:33.940 --> 18:37.611
lt's the one where he finds himself
adrift at sea after a boating accident

18:37.819 --> 18:41.281
and vividly relives his father's death
during the Korean War.

18:45.535 --> 18:47.787
l'm gonna go out on a limb here.

18:47.954 --> 18:49.456
You think you were framed.

18:50.498 --> 18:52.083
Now we're getting somewhere.

18:52.626 --> 18:54.878
And who do you think
it was who framed you?

18:55.879 --> 18:57.964
Well,

18:58.131 --> 19:01.343
any one of a hundred people,
maybe.

19:01.509 --> 19:03.303
l have a list if you're interested.

19:03.470 --> 19:06.348
Do you realise the kind of trouble
you're in here, DiNozzo?

19:07.390 --> 19:10.810
Oh, believe me. l do.

19:13.855 --> 19:16.483
Do you realise
that you have an enormous clump

19:16.650 --> 19:18.652
of something green
between your teeth?

19:18.818 --> 19:20.904
lt's right there.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.912
What is it about women?

19:29.120 --> 19:32.374
ls it the way they smell
or the beguiling smiles?

19:32.541 --> 19:34.876
The whispers? The secrets?

19:35.085 --> 19:38.713
The way they tiptoe around
in those little ridiculous shoes?

19:38.880 --> 19:44.010
And the way they fit their tiny
little bodies into those tiny little outfits.

19:44.511 --> 19:46.721
You're wasting my time.

19:56.231 --> 19:57.691
Take it easy.

19:57.857 --> 20:01.778
This guy is implicated in a homicide,
and he's making jokes.

20:01.945 --> 20:04.531
You've never worked with NClS
before, have you, Agent Sacks?

20:04.698 --> 20:07.868
Federal agents suspected of crimes
don't get special treatment in my book.

20:08.034 --> 20:09.703
lt's late.
We should collect the evidence.

20:09.870 --> 20:12.080
We have to arrest him, Fornell.

20:12.247 --> 20:14.708
Bite marks don't lie,
and this guy can't stop.

20:15.125 --> 20:16.710
l'll think about it.

21:05.592 --> 21:07.886
The U.S. attorney's gonna see this
as a heinous crime.

21:08.094 --> 21:10.597
lt is a heinous crime, Fornell.

21:10.764 --> 21:13.225
- Tony didn't do it.
- Without an alibi.

21:15.352 --> 21:17.103
l'd be remiss if we didn't detain him.

21:17.270 --> 21:19.648
People are gonna think
we're orchestrating a cover-up.

21:22.817 --> 21:24.819
- Finally. How'd l do?
- Fine.

21:24.986 --> 21:27.822
Fine?
l thought l was Oscar material.

21:27.989 --> 21:29.282
Fornell's not gonna book you.

21:31.952 --> 21:35.288
But he is gonna take you into custody
until we figure out a few things.

21:52.389 --> 21:53.640
You all right?

21:54.933 --> 21:56.977
l must have screwed up, Gibbs.

21:59.145 --> 22:01.690
You didn't screw up, Abs.

22:02.232 --> 22:04.818
But now l have all this evidence.

22:04.985 --> 22:08.280
Forensics.
The thing that l love and l believe in.

22:08.446 --> 22:10.156
And it says Tony's a murderer.

22:10.323 --> 22:13.702
- Tony's not a murderer.
- l know he isn't.

22:14.494 --> 22:16.371
But something's gotta give.

22:16.538 --> 22:19.708
l mean, either
the forensics are wrong,

22:19.875 --> 22:24.379
just bad forensics, or...

22:24.546 --> 22:26.715
We have to save him, Gibbs.

22:29.175 --> 22:32.053
- We will.
- Because if this goes to court,

22:32.262 --> 22:35.515
with his fingerprint
and his bite mark on the leg,

22:35.682 --> 22:38.977
Tony's gonna go to prison
for the rest of his life.

22:39.185 --> 22:41.855
And l'll be the one
to put him there.

22:59.873 --> 23:02.167
l smelled you coming, boss.

23:03.143 --> 23:06.980
Pepperoni, sausage,
extra cheese, right?

23:08.565 --> 23:10.984
My favourite. Thanks.

23:13.904 --> 23:16.073
l'll save that for later.

23:17.741 --> 23:19.868
You know, l've been thinking.

23:21.078 --> 23:23.956
l'm a federal prosecutor's dream.

23:26.166 --> 23:29.920
You do tend to date a lot,
don't you, Mr. DiNozzo?

23:30.838 --> 23:35.342
Yeah. l do tend to date a lot,
but where does it say

23:35.509 --> 23:38.303
that dating, you know, a new girl
every week is a crime?

23:38.470 --> 23:39.680
No, it's not.

23:40.264 --> 23:43.100
But it does speak to your deep-seated
psychological problems

23:43.267 --> 23:45.978
and commitment issues.

23:46.145 --> 23:47.312
Really?

23:47.479 --> 23:53.193
So you're saying my intimacy issues
stem from my mother,

23:53.402 --> 23:56.738
who dressed me as a sailor
until l was 1 0 years old?

23:56.947 --> 23:58.157
Maybe.

24:01.910 --> 24:04.079
Well, l guess it might explain

24:04.288 --> 24:10.127
why you objectify women
and treat them as sexual objects.

24:10.335 --> 24:16.091
While you're being so forthright
and insightful, Mr. DiNozzo,

24:18.802 --> 24:21.513
why did you sink your teeth
into the victim's leg?

24:21.722 --> 24:25.851
Because l'm angry
and l'm immature,

24:26.393 --> 24:29.104
and l like control.

24:29.313 --> 24:30.689
You have no alibi.

24:30.856 --> 24:34.401
Alibi? How can l have an alibi

24:34.568 --> 24:37.070
when the murder
doesn't even have a time or a date?

24:37.738 --> 24:40.240
That's interesting.
What about means?

24:40.449 --> 24:42.075
Latex glove?

24:42.576 --> 24:44.286
Scalpel?

24:44.828 --> 24:47.706
You could have gotten
these things

24:47.873 --> 24:50.709
from work. No?

24:50.876 --> 24:53.003
Right. Of course.

24:53.212 --> 24:57.341
Yes, l ripped a glove at the scene.
lt seems a little sloppy

24:57.508 --> 25:00.219
for a federal agent
who investigates crime scenes,

25:00.385 --> 25:03.055
but, you know, those are the breaks
when you're a homicidal maniac

25:03.222 --> 25:04.556
dumping butchered
women's remains

25:04.723 --> 25:07.976
out in the woods
in the middle of the night. Right?

25:16.819 --> 25:19.071
l'm not getting out of this one,
am l, boss?

25:29.081 --> 25:31.041
Thank you, boss.

25:46.306 --> 25:48.475
Mike Macaluso. Still in jail.

25:48.684 --> 25:51.061
My sources say,
his family is very happy about it.

25:51.270 --> 25:54.398
How is it you've been in this country a
few months, you already got sources?

25:54.565 --> 25:56.608
Who says my sources
are from this country, McGee?

25:56.817 --> 25:59.111
<i>- ls this Agent Timothy McGee?
- Yes, hi.</i>

25:59.278 --> 26:01.113
<i>- He was killed in prison.
- Killed in prison?</i>

26:01.280 --> 26:03.282
<i>- l'm sorry for your loss.
- Can we ship the body?</i>

26:03.448 --> 26:05.325
No, you'll have to take that up
with lCE.

26:05.492 --> 26:06.743
- Dead.
- Where are we?

26:06.910 --> 26:09.705
Head of my suspects list
is George Stewart.

26:09.913 --> 26:12.249
The forensic tech Tony
got fired from Baltimore P.D.

26:12.458 --> 26:14.251
Lost everything
when Tony accused him

26:14.418 --> 26:16.295
of contaminating
blood samples in '02.

26:16.462 --> 26:19.131
- Define ''everything.''
- Wife, house, kids.

26:19.298 --> 26:21.967
Fought the firing and won,
but by then, no one would hire him.

26:22.134 --> 26:23.469
Disappeared two years ago.

26:23.635 --> 26:24.887
- How did he win?
- Don't know.

26:25.095 --> 26:27.598
<i>George Stewart vs. Baltimore P.D.
was sealed.</i>

26:27.806 --> 26:30.267
- Un-disappear him.
- Right.

26:31.310 --> 26:33.312
Lieutenant Pam Kim.
Surgical nurse.

26:33.479 --> 26:36.023
Fully capable of slicing off
a woman's legs.

26:36.190 --> 26:39.860
Met Tony on the Jeremy Davison
serial-rapist case.

26:40.027 --> 26:42.529
- At Quantico.
- She's the one that egged Tony's car.

26:42.696 --> 26:44.490
- Really?
- Where is she now?

26:44.656 --> 26:47.826
Virginia. Returned two weeks ago
from a tour in lraq.

26:47.993 --> 26:49.828
She's on her honeymoon
at the Greenbrier.

26:49.995 --> 26:51.622
- Who'd she marry?
- Scott Sparks.

26:51.788 --> 26:54.124
That's the guy that she was
engaged to when she met Tony.

26:54.291 --> 26:56.210
- Get her in here.
- On it.

26:56.794 --> 27:01.006
Boss? l was thinking,
she's on her honeymoon.

27:03.717 --> 27:05.385
Yeah?

27:09.681 --> 27:11.475
Ever heard of coitus interruptus,

27:11.642 --> 27:13.685
- Special Agent Gibbs?
- Nope.

27:14.186 --> 27:16.772
- Ever been on a honeymoon?
- Yep.

27:16.980 --> 27:18.690
- Then you know l feel.
- You found them--?

27:18.857 --> 27:21.985
- Flagrante delicto.
- That's--

27:22.152 --> 27:25.823
Roman slang for what Tony calls
badda-bing badda-boom.

27:26.323 --> 27:29.034
Being dragged into NClS
for interrogation

27:29.201 --> 27:31.119
isn't exactly the best way
to start a marriage.

27:31.286 --> 27:34.164
ls your husband the same guy you
dumped for Tony DiNozzo last year?

27:35.874 --> 27:40.838
Look, l had a fling with Tony,
and l regret every last minute of it.

27:41.046 --> 27:43.090
ls that why you put him
on the herpes website?

27:44.758 --> 27:46.760
l got a little emotional.

27:47.302 --> 27:49.054
A little emotional was egging his car.

27:49.221 --> 27:50.889
Putting him
on the herpes website was--

27:51.056 --> 27:53.142
Bitchy? l know.

27:54.768 --> 27:59.439
What does a woman accomplish
by cracking eggs on a man's car?

28:00.023 --> 28:02.276
A lot of guys really care
about their cars.

28:02.442 --> 28:05.737
lt's kind of like a ''you break my heart,
l break yours'' thing.

28:06.405 --> 28:09.575
ln lsrael,
we just shoot men who are untrue.

28:10.409 --> 28:14.037
Look. Tony could have turned me in
when l was harassing him.

28:14.246 --> 28:18.584
He didn't. lf anything, l owe him.

28:18.750 --> 28:21.044
When were you last at Quantico?

28:21.628 --> 28:24.089
l've been on tour in lraq
for the last eight months.

28:24.256 --> 28:26.049
That's not my question.

28:26.884 --> 28:29.928
l checked in with my command
ten days ago

28:30.095 --> 28:32.639
before l took leave to get married.

28:33.432 --> 28:35.767
Look, if someone
brown-bagged Tony's door

28:35.934 --> 28:37.769
or torched his car, it wasn't me.

28:37.936 --> 28:39.438
Does your husband
know about Tony?

28:39.605 --> 28:41.732
Of course he knows. What--

28:42.316 --> 28:46.445
Scott's a lawyer. lf he has a problem
with someone, he sues them, not--

28:47.571 --> 28:49.281
Tony wasn't murdered, was he?

28:50.073 --> 28:53.911
- No.
- Then what is this about?

28:56.747 --> 28:58.582
Lieutenant...

28:59.833 --> 29:02.795
...you can return to your honeymoon,
but if l need you--

29:04.463 --> 29:07.674
We'll be at the Greenbrier
for another week.

29:10.302 --> 29:12.638
And next time,
have your agent knock.

29:20.687 --> 29:23.440
Boss, do you really not know
what coitus interruptus means?

29:23.607 --> 29:24.775
Better question.

29:24.942 --> 29:27.528
Do you know what it means
if you haven't located Stewart?

29:27.736 --> 29:29.238
My father used to say:

29:31.657 --> 29:34.952
- Translate.
- A little fire burns a great deal of corn.

29:36.370 --> 29:38.789
- What?
- lt never made sense to me either.

29:38.997 --> 29:42.334
lt loses something in translation.
Director.

29:44.962 --> 29:47.548
l saw Lieutenant Kim leave.
She have an alibi?

29:47.714 --> 29:50.050
No. She framed DiNozzo
and l let her go.

29:50.259 --> 29:52.803
- So George Stewart is--
- He's next on my list.

29:53.011 --> 29:55.055
You know, there's no reason
to be petulant, Jethro.

29:55.222 --> 29:56.807
The word's pissed, Jen.
You know what?

29:56.974 --> 29:58.767
You can drop the director act.
We're alone.

29:58.934 --> 30:01.728
- You think my job is an act?
- No, not all of it.

30:01.895 --> 30:04.481
Ass-kissing on the Hill is a skill.

30:04.690 --> 30:07.025
- So is castration.
- l wear a cup.

30:13.949 --> 30:15.200
What is this?

30:15.367 --> 30:18.036
George Stewart's alias
and work address.

30:18.203 --> 30:21.540
l managed to find it
between kissing asses.

30:23.250 --> 30:25.878
lt just proves
you should've stayed a field agent.

30:35.137 --> 30:36.805
Ma'am?

30:38.098 --> 30:39.766
Abby?

30:41.226 --> 30:44.146
- What?
- l think l found something

30:44.313 --> 30:46.732
- that might help out Tony.
- Why didn't you say so?

30:46.899 --> 30:49.234
Maybe not exonerate,
but place someone else at the scene.

30:49.401 --> 30:51.528
- What is it?
- The sticky substance on the ankle?

30:51.695 --> 30:52.863
- Yes.
- Well,

30:53.030 --> 30:55.240
l chemically
and instrumentally examined it.

30:55.407 --> 30:58.285
The material's an adhesive. The kind
found in duct tape or carpet tape.

30:58.452 --> 30:59.786
How does this help Tony?

30:59.953 --> 31:03.248
l discovered an anomaly
in the adhesive material. A carpet fibre.

31:03.415 --> 31:06.502
l used the FTlS and the mass spec
to determine its chemical composition.

31:06.710 --> 31:08.420
lt's a DuPont fibre for a Mustang.

31:08.587 --> 31:10.923
- But Tony drives--
- l know what Tony drives.

31:11.089 --> 31:12.966
But when l tested
the stain resistance,

31:13.175 --> 31:16.428
it showed the fibre had a coating
from a 2004 Mustang.

31:16.595 --> 31:19.139
Tony's Mustang is a '66.

31:19.306 --> 31:21.099
lt couldn't have been his car.

31:21.308 --> 31:24.770
We have to get a fibre from Tony's car
before it gets towed.

31:24.978 --> 31:27.564
Nice to have you back, Abby.

31:32.861 --> 31:34.738
- George Stewart?
- Petrie.

31:35.447 --> 31:37.115
l changed it legally.

31:40.327 --> 31:42.663
- No sailors here.
- Any Jane Does?

31:42.871 --> 31:45.624
- Always got a couple of them.
- Could we see them?

31:46.083 --> 31:48.627
l told you, no sailors here.

31:48.794 --> 31:50.504
How do you know,
if they're Jane Does?

31:50.671 --> 31:52.673
Look, what the hell
do you two want?

31:52.840 --> 31:54.341
To see your Jane Does.

31:54.508 --> 31:55.676
Got a warrant?

31:56.385 --> 31:58.762
No. Do we need one?

31:58.929 --> 32:00.305
Hell, yes. Now get out.

32:01.682 --> 32:04.143
Tony DiNozzo.

32:06.353 --> 32:08.438
What did that bastard
say about me now?

32:09.523 --> 32:11.316
l was exonerated.

32:17.364 --> 32:19.449
How were you exonerated?

32:22.161 --> 32:23.620
Fourth Circuit Court.

32:26.123 --> 32:27.791
Wasn't me that
messed up that blood test.

32:27.958 --> 32:30.544
- l sent it out to a lab.
- What's the name of the lab?

32:32.504 --> 32:34.298
Pemberton Medical Analysis.

32:35.507 --> 32:37.259
Sure we can't take
a quick look around?

32:37.468 --> 32:40.012
Not without a warrant.
That's what happened last time.

32:40.179 --> 32:42.681
Just a quick look around.
A few questions.

32:42.848 --> 32:46.226
Then l'm fired and my life is trashed.
Now get out.

32:47.978 --> 32:49.813
We'll be back.

32:50.606 --> 32:52.524
With a warrant.

33:05.245 --> 33:08.874
Reasonable doubt
can go a long way with a jury, Chip.

33:10.417 --> 33:14.671
lf this is someone else's carpet fibre
that was on that duct tape--

33:16.256 --> 33:18.050
Hello.

33:18.967 --> 33:20.886
Frame-up.

33:21.053 --> 33:24.890
The bite mark? l guess you could steal
dental records, create your own mould.

33:25.057 --> 33:27.559
- Make an impression on the leg.
- Keep going. Keep going.

33:27.726 --> 33:30.270
The print, anyone could've
pulled those gloves from our trash.

33:30.437 --> 33:31.647
- Yes.
- Yeah.

33:31.814 --> 33:33.565
But how would anyone know
which is Tony's?

33:33.732 --> 33:35.108
Don't blow it, Chip.

33:35.275 --> 33:36.777
You're on a roll.

33:37.528 --> 33:38.904
Sorry.

33:42.324 --> 33:45.285
- See what l mean?
- No.

33:45.452 --> 33:49.289
The carpet fibres match.
Tony must've redone his carpeting.

33:49.456 --> 33:52.417
Never have a negative thought
when you're on a roll.

33:52.626 --> 33:55.796
- lt could have been worse.
- How?

33:55.963 --> 33:59.800
The blood on the severed leg,
DNA came back with a match.

33:59.967 --> 34:01.260
lt matched DiNozzo.

34:24.951 --> 34:26.161
What are you doing?

34:26.328 --> 34:28.871
l was trying to throw away
your Caf-Pow!

34:29.039 --> 34:31.041
- Why?
- l bought you a fresh one

34:31.208 --> 34:33.793
- while you were sleeping.
- l can't sleep. l have to save Tony.

34:33.960 --> 34:37.380
What time is it? Six a.m.?
l lost two hours.

34:37.547 --> 34:39.674
l have been running
Jane Doe's DNA everywhere.

34:39.841 --> 34:41.342
She's not in CODlS,
the armed forces,

34:41.509 --> 34:44.094
the fertility clinics,
rare-disease databases.

34:44.262 --> 34:45.679
Abby. Abby, it's not your fault.

34:45.847 --> 34:48.016
Not my fault? Someone's
using forensics to frame Tony.

34:48.183 --> 34:50.685
- l'm letting them get away with it.
- You'll find something.

34:50.851 --> 34:54.856
How? All the FBl left me was
a speck of blood and a carpet fibre.

34:55.023 --> 34:57.692
l have to look at this
from a new perspective.

34:59.527 --> 35:00.862
Your butt's getting bony.

35:02.781 --> 35:06.910
Bony? l'll have you know that Ziva
rated it a four out of five, okay?

35:07.077 --> 35:11.206
Bone marrow. There's a national
database for bone-marrow donors.

35:12.457 --> 35:13.875
Why is Ziva rating your butt?

35:14.709 --> 35:17.170
- Tony started it.
- Don't you blame Tony.

35:17.337 --> 35:21.508
- He's almost on death row right now.
- No, no, no. Look, l--

35:22.342 --> 35:25.637
Jane Doe is Carla Johnson.

35:25.804 --> 35:29.766
You matched my DNA
with a pair of disembodied legs?

35:29.975 --> 35:33.353
l'd fire whatever lab
you're using at NClS, Agent Gibbs.

35:33.812 --> 35:37.107
l assure you,
they're real and they're mine.

35:39.150 --> 35:40.777
Are you a bone-marrow donor?

35:40.944 --> 35:43.405
l volunteered for bone marrow,
organs, blood.

35:43.572 --> 35:45.115
l believe in sharing my good health.

35:45.282 --> 35:47.784
But l draw the line at body parts,
at least until l'm dead.

35:47.993 --> 35:51.371
We got the DNA match
from a bone-marrow database.

35:51.580 --> 35:53.874
l haven't donated
any bone marrow yet.

35:54.082 --> 35:57.836
l did give blood to an accident victim
a couple of weeks ago.

35:58.003 --> 35:59.671
She died on the operating table.

35:59.838 --> 36:01.423
Did she lose her legs?

36:01.590 --> 36:03.758
No. Her chest was crushed.

36:03.925 --> 36:05.260
Where is her body now?

36:05.427 --> 36:08.471
Either at our morgue or the state's.
She was a Jane Doe.

36:10.265 --> 36:12.058
l can't believe
the blood we DNA-tested

36:12.225 --> 36:14.728
was someone else's from a
transfusion. What are the odds?

36:14.895 --> 36:17.606
The same as this killer getting away
with framing Tony.

36:17.772 --> 36:20.025
Well, the guy is a genius.
You gotta give him that.

36:20.233 --> 36:22.527
Even genii make mistakes. l did.

36:23.445 --> 36:25.196
What was your mistake?

36:25.363 --> 36:28.950
Giving up on forensics
when l should have looked deeper.

36:30.410 --> 36:33.371
- We already processed that fibre.
- l know that, Chaz-zoid.

36:33.538 --> 36:36.708
But the killer picked up this fibre,
took it to work,

36:36.875 --> 36:38.835
had it in his car,
carried it through the woods.

36:39.002 --> 36:43.548
There has to be some sign
of that guy on this fibre.

36:43.757 --> 36:45.425
Not if he wore gloves.

36:45.592 --> 36:47.969
Maybe the gloves have
a different residue than NClS gloves.

36:48.136 --> 36:50.222
Maybe he smokes a cigar.

36:50.388 --> 36:52.140
Maybe there's cigar residue
on the fibre.

36:52.349 --> 36:54.976
You're testing for cigar smoke?

36:59.105 --> 37:00.982
For a second...

37:01.608 --> 37:05.111
...l lost my faith in--

37:06.404 --> 37:10.825
But now l know that forensics
was just testing me.

37:10.992 --> 37:12.452
And l will rise up,

37:12.661 --> 37:18.917
and l will find the man that did this
to Tony and l will crucify him.

37:23.880 --> 37:27.467
ls it standard operating procedure
for nurses to give transfusions?

37:27.634 --> 37:30.637
No. We were low on blood
and l'm a universal donor.

37:31.388 --> 37:34.140
ldentifying a pair of legs
must be a first.

37:37.269 --> 37:41.022
Here it is. Jane Doe was transferred
to the Virginia County Coroner's office

37:41.189 --> 37:43.567
- eight days ago.
- Who signed for the body?

37:44.442 --> 37:46.069
We have a warrant now.

37:46.486 --> 37:49.364
For what?
l didn't do anything wrong.

37:49.531 --> 37:51.491
No? l can think
of at least two things.

37:51.700 --> 37:53.368
Framing an NClS agent for murder.

37:53.535 --> 37:58.039
- Really, really, really pissing him off.
- Open it.

37:58.206 --> 38:00.876
l strongly recommend
you do what he says.

38:20.061 --> 38:23.398
This explains why Jane Doe's legs
were in pristine condition.

38:23.565 --> 38:25.108
You think l cut off some girl's legs?

38:25.275 --> 38:27.110
- Did you?
- No.

38:27.277 --> 38:28.945
Why would l ever do such a thing?

38:29.112 --> 38:30.947
l don't know,
but if you're gonna talk to me,

38:31.114 --> 38:34.492
please get a breath mint first.
Please.

38:48.381 --> 38:51.343
- Very funny, probie.
- Come on, Tony. lt's a gift.

38:51.551 --> 38:54.763
From who?
The baggie bunnies or Pam Kim?

38:54.930 --> 38:56.681
No, actually it's from Chip.

38:56.848 --> 38:59.809
Great. Now l'm getting crap
from lab monkeys.

38:59.976 --> 39:02.270
Not for much longer.

39:02.437 --> 39:04.606
l knew boss would get me out of here.
What'd he find?

39:04.773 --> 39:06.650
Hopefully the body
that goes with those legs.

39:06.816 --> 39:09.486
- What do you mean, probie?
- Abby matched the legs you severed.

39:09.653 --> 39:12.572
- l didn't sever any legs.
- Sorry, a slip of the tongue.

39:13.114 --> 39:15.158
The legs you supposedly severed.

39:15.325 --> 39:17.285
DNA matched
to a Carla Johnson, who--

39:17.452 --> 39:19.996
- You are not gonna believe this.
- l will if it gets me out.

39:20.205 --> 39:22.249
- She's alive.
- With no legs.

39:22.457 --> 39:23.959
No, she's got legs.

39:28.630 --> 39:31.091
- Okay, Tony.
- Prison changes a man.

39:31.299 --> 39:32.634
Tony, come on, man.

39:54.322 --> 39:57.117
- He's doing it to me again.
- You have the right to remain silent.

39:57.284 --> 39:59.035
- DiNozzo set me up.
- Anything you say

39:59.202 --> 40:01.705
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

40:03.665 --> 40:05.625
l never thought l'd say this...

40:06.793 --> 40:09.921
...but l am so happy to see you,
Fornell.

40:11.047 --> 40:13.466
That makes one of us, DiNozzo.

40:13.633 --> 40:17.012
Never even got to do my
Cool Hand Luke impersonation either.

40:17.178 --> 40:21.099
What we got here
is a failure to communicate.

40:21.308 --> 40:23.768
- Never saw it.
- Are you kidding me?

40:23.977 --> 40:27.188
Only the greatest chain-gang movie
of all time.

40:39.826 --> 40:43.914
They're throwing a little welcome-back
party for Agent DiNozzo upstairs.

40:44.080 --> 40:45.540
Go, Chip. l'm not finished here.

40:45.707 --> 40:48.460
There is no way that Stewart
pulled this off by himself.

40:48.627 --> 40:50.545
- Why not?
- Because l refuse to believe

40:50.712 --> 40:53.715
that some alcoholic ME's assistant
beat me at my own game.

40:53.965 --> 40:55.550
Abby, don't you think
you're obsessing?

40:55.717 --> 40:58.094
You know what l found
in the little fibres, Chippy?

40:58.303 --> 41:02.015
Sodium, chloride, potassium,
lactate, urea.

41:02.224 --> 41:03.892
- Sweat?
- Exactly.

41:04.100 --> 41:06.353
Should be able to pull DNA
from that.

41:06.519 --> 41:08.897
l've also put a call in
to Pemberton Medical Analysis,

41:09.064 --> 41:11.399
the lab that fired Stewart.
He's probably after them too.

41:11.608 --> 41:15.862
- What can l do to help?
- Stay out of my way.

41:16.029 --> 41:18.573
l didn't doubt you for a second, boss.
Well, maybe one second.

41:18.740 --> 41:21.201
No, don't thank me. lt was all Abby.

41:21.368 --> 41:24.162
The poor girl hasn't slept
since this entire affair began.

41:24.621 --> 41:27.332
- Where is she?
- She's probably passed on by now.

41:27.499 --> 41:31.086
- The term is passed out.
- Whatever. The girl is tired.

41:31.836 --> 41:35.090
l got the court records from Stewart's
case against Baltimore unsealed.

41:35.257 --> 41:37.425
You're a little late, Jen.

41:39.594 --> 41:42.722
l mean, thank you, director.

41:42.931 --> 41:44.391
Better, Jethro.

41:44.558 --> 41:46.851
All l'm saying is that
you might wanna warn the person

41:47.018 --> 41:48.270
who actually made the mistake

41:48.436 --> 41:50.272
<i>- that got Stewart fired.
- Now, that--</i>

41:50.438 --> 41:52.482
Hello? Hello?

41:54.276 --> 41:56.444
lt looks like we lost our connection,
Abby.

41:56.611 --> 41:57.821
lt was you.

41:59.364 --> 42:01.908
You worked
at Pemberton Medical Analysis.

42:03.034 --> 42:05.078
Until l got fired.

42:05.287 --> 42:07.414
You took this job
just to set up Tony?

42:09.124 --> 42:10.375
Yep.

42:10.584 --> 42:15.881
And l did a pretty good job at it,
didn't l? Didn't l?

42:36.943 --> 42:38.570
You know,

42:39.321 --> 42:42.741
l thought a fair trade
would be taking down those two idiots

42:42.949 --> 42:44.576
who got me fired.

42:45.452 --> 42:49.956
But you couldn't leave
well enough alone, could you?

42:50.415 --> 42:52.083
Could you?

42:57.339 --> 42:58.840
Jethro?

43:02.010 --> 43:03.929
Abby.

43:23.531 --> 43:25.867
Now can l work alone?
