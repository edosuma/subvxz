WEBVTT

00:31.281 --> 00:32.157
[groans softly]

00:49.048 --> 00:49.966
[yawning]

00:50.884 --> 00:52.260
What the fuck?

00:52.260 --> 00:54.220
Well, you look like shit.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.347
[both laugh]

00:58.183 --> 01:00.810
Everybody!
Fucknut lives.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.563
[Larry] Finally.
You've been asleep
for three days.

01:03.563 --> 01:04.522
[chuckles]

01:07.233 --> 01:08.526
What is going on?

01:08.526 --> 01:10.737
[Vic] We was hoping
that you could tell us.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.864
Everything was
a hell of a lot less
<i>George of the Jungle</i>

01:12.864 --> 01:14.699
around here
until you rolled up.

01:14.699 --> 01:17.452
Oh, Gar, meet Vic.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.704
There's a 50/50 chance
you'll kill each other.

01:23.583 --> 01:24.459
[metal whirring]

01:27.962 --> 01:29.839
Nice guns.

01:29.839 --> 01:33.301
[Cliff] So you gonna tell us
why we've been mowing
Mother Nature's bush

01:33.301 --> 01:34.886
for the past 72 hours?

01:34.886 --> 01:36.846
[Larry] First of all,
so wrong.

01:36.846 --> 01:39.349
Second, it's not just that
the house is blooming.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.226
It's also not our house.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.269
[Larry] And just to make
the madness complete...

01:45.855 --> 01:47.482
there's apparently no way out.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.068
So?

01:51.277 --> 01:52.821
Any answers, Broccoli Top?

01:59.327 --> 02:01.663
I... I'm not sure where we are.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.666
[siren wailing]

02:13.174 --> 02:14.467
I'm taking over LexCorp.

02:15.677 --> 02:16.553
Good for you.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.097
That could be good for us.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.271
Wouldn't you like a morning

02:26.271 --> 02:30.692
where May Bennett's
marionette strings
aren't pulling you out of bed?

02:30.692 --> 02:33.361
Walking you to where
she wants you to go?

02:33.361 --> 02:35.488
You don't know
anything about me.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.949
Well, I know you haven't
blown that Horn

02:37.949 --> 02:39.784
and brought Trigon
into the world.

02:41.494 --> 02:46.040
And I know that
you're May Bennett's
suicide bomber,

02:46.040 --> 02:48.918
and once she straps you
with her hatred,

02:48.918 --> 02:51.754
kicks you into a shopping mall,
she watches the explosion.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.010
And nothing of you remains.

03:06.686 --> 03:07.854
That's programming code.

03:09.188 --> 03:10.481
[breathes heavily]

03:13.443 --> 03:17.822
You know what we call
the things we keep
in a little private book

03:17.822 --> 03:19.365
that we don't want
others to see?

03:22.869 --> 03:24.370
We call those dreams.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.752
What's your dream, Sebastian?

03:37.008 --> 03:40.053
I wanted to create something

03:40.053 --> 03:42.388
that would bring
the whole world together.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.226
I wanted to make games.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.275
Sounds ridiculous now,
doesn't it?

03:56.235 --> 03:57.779
No, it doesn't.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.493
Join me at LexCorp.

04:05.995 --> 04:07.497
Whatever is in that book,

04:08.790 --> 04:10.166
I can make it a reality.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.464
I don't dream anymore.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.049
[laughs] Sebastian...

04:19.217 --> 04:20.885
I'm here.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.512
I'm asking you what you want.

04:24.764 --> 04:27.433
When's the last time
someone did that for you?

04:27.433 --> 04:31.270
Has May Bennett ever
done that for you?

04:45.785 --> 04:46.661
[sighs]

04:51.082 --> 04:52.041
Consider my offer.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.796
Call the number on that card
if you want to believe
in dreams again.

05:24.615 --> 05:25.491
You're late.

05:28.953 --> 05:31.456
Uh, I... I thought if we were
gonna change the world,

05:31.456 --> 05:33.666
I might have time
to at least grab
a cup of coffee.

05:35.334 --> 05:37.295
You're now at the end
of the journey.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.965
Tonight we trumpet the Horn,

05:42.592 --> 05:45.094
let your father arrive,

05:45.094 --> 05:49.265
in the center
of their gleaming city.

05:49.265 --> 05:53.478
I would love to see
Metropolis be the first
brought to its knees.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.315
You never asked me
what I wanted.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.193
What?

06:00.193 --> 06:02.236
How come you never
ask me what I want?

06:05.698 --> 06:08.701
We don't need to summon Trigon.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.287
I have power.

06:11.287 --> 06:14.248
Mother, I have power.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.419
[laughing]

06:20.254 --> 06:22.215
Ah, you have power?

06:22.215 --> 06:23.382
- Yeah.
- [both chuckle]

06:24.133 --> 06:24.967
Oh.

06:27.053 --> 06:27.970
You're nothing.

06:29.972 --> 06:33.851
Without Trigon's power,
you will always be nothing.

06:36.813 --> 06:37.897
[breathing heavily]

06:37.897 --> 06:38.815
Nothing?

06:38.815 --> 06:39.982
I gave you destiny.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.736
And now you want to shame me?

06:43.736 --> 06:44.862
Pathetic child.

06:44.862 --> 06:46.531
Don't, Mother.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.491
[Mother Mayhem]
Don't call me that.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.327
My son would not be a coward.

06:51.327 --> 06:54.831
My son would
embrace this power.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.290
I am trying.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.044
I'm trying.
What do you want from me?

07:00.920 --> 07:01.796
[sighs]

07:02.547 --> 07:03.798
You are so...

07:05.258 --> 07:06.467
desperately,

07:07.260 --> 07:09.595
disgustingly weak.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.099
Oh.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.684
Are you gonna cry, Sebastian?

07:14.684 --> 07:16.102
- Are you crying, Sebastian?
- [sniffles]

07:16.102 --> 07:17.854
[Mother Mayhem gasps]

07:17.854 --> 07:20.690
Piss yourself
and cry all you want,

07:20.690 --> 07:24.402
but tonight you're gonna
use that Horn and you're
gonna bring him back to us.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.659
[screaming] No!

07:37.123 --> 07:39.167
[screaming]

07:58.728 --> 08:00.813
[theme music playing]

08:16.329 --> 08:18.247
[Conner] And that is why
I am formally taking over

08:18.247 --> 08:21.584
all LexCorp operations
as the new CEO.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.170
Now, I know there were rumors

08:25.421 --> 08:26.714
that I was his enemy,

08:28.090 --> 08:30.051
his creation.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.596
Consider me his son.

08:33.596 --> 08:37.850
Consider this an inheritance
of his legacy.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.229
And a new direction.

08:41.229 --> 08:44.815
Expect to see
LexCorp's influence
grow across the globe.

08:46.817 --> 08:50.947
Technical innovation
that brings the world closer,

08:50.947 --> 08:52.615
instead of tearing it apart.

08:54.116 --> 08:54.992
Clean energy,

08:55.993 --> 08:57.745
ending starvation,

08:57.745 --> 08:58.663
disease,

08:59.580 --> 09:01.958
poverty.

09:01.958 --> 09:06.379
Capitalism and conscience
don't have to be enemies
in a zero-sum game.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.216
Thank you, everyone.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.218
- I'll take questions now.
- [reporters clamoring]

09:13.386 --> 09:14.929
[woman on TV
speaking indistinctly]

09:14.929 --> 09:17.306
So, Conner's playing Lex
and teaming up with Sebastian.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.559
He's too smart for that.

09:20.559 --> 09:21.727
He's working an angle.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.813
[Bernard]
You gotta give it to him.

09:23.813 --> 09:27.233
He does the whole bald-headed,
charming psychopath thing
very well. [chuckles]

09:27.233 --> 09:29.151
What if he is working
with Sebastian?

09:31.028 --> 09:32.613
We up against him now, too?

09:32.613 --> 09:34.907
[Dick] May Bennett offered
Sebastian Armageddon.

09:34.907 --> 09:39.120
What did Conner offer him
to get him standing
on that stage?

09:39.120 --> 09:42.498
Well, now I'm wondering
what's worse than Armageddon.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.543
[Rachel] So let's go
to LexCorp.

09:45.543 --> 09:48.337
Conner will have to decide
which side he's on,

09:48.337 --> 09:51.465
and then, either way,
this thing's finished.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.138
What?

09:59.682 --> 10:00.725
You're shutting me out?

10:00.725 --> 10:02.226
[Dick] We're protecting you.

10:02.226 --> 10:04.312
He cut you with a knife
and he bled the same way.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.689
Whatever happens to him
could happen to you.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.024
Yeah, in that town.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.734
We're not in that town anymore.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.485
We're your family.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.612
We're deciding
not to take the risk.

10:13.612 --> 10:15.740
Sebastian is my family, too.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.825
We have the same father,
the same blood.

10:17.825 --> 10:20.786
All of this happened
because of me.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.330
Because of what I am.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.707
If I have to die to stop it,
then better me than Kory.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.584
No one has to die.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.295
Agreed. Maybe there's a way
to sever the connection
between you two.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.839
[Tim] We broke a town free
from a magical curse.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.591
There has to be a way.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.510
Exactly. Look,
magic is just science
we don't understand yet.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.137
Except when it's not.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.430
The connection is genetic.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.766
You can't just recode DNA
with a spell.

10:43.768 --> 10:47.271
Please, don't make me do this.
Don't make me wait
on the sidelines.

10:47.271 --> 10:48.522
Let me help.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.860
I gotta make a call.

10:52.860 --> 10:53.903
Long distance.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.326
What the fuck is long distance?

11:00.326 --> 11:02.745
I don't know anything
you don't.

11:02.745 --> 11:07.416
Look, I'm gonna go
prep us on Baby Luthor
and Mr. End of the World.

11:09.668 --> 11:11.837
Keep an eye on LexCorp, hm?

11:11.837 --> 11:12.755
Hm.

11:20.554 --> 11:21.430
[sighs]

11:29.105 --> 11:29.939
[Larry] The door.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.774
- [Cliff] No!
- No!

11:33.526 --> 11:34.819
[Cliff laughing] Oh!

11:34.819 --> 11:35.778
[door closes]

11:39.031 --> 11:39.907
[groans]

11:41.700 --> 11:44.453
Fuck.
[breathes deeply and groans]

11:46.080 --> 11:47.248
Do I know you?

11:47.248 --> 11:48.290
[Gar] Kory?

11:49.708 --> 11:51.961
- Gar?
- [both laugh]

11:51.961 --> 11:53.212
[Kory] Oh, my gosh.

11:54.046 --> 11:54.964
Are you okay?

11:54.964 --> 11:56.424
Yeah. Have you guys been okay?

11:56.424 --> 11:59.343
Yeah. Rachel heard your voice.
You saved us.

11:59.343 --> 12:01.804
So, we just gonna ignore
the sucker punch or...

12:01.804 --> 12:05.516
Uh, Kory. You remember
Cliff and Larry?

12:05.516 --> 12:07.977
Yeah, I thought
I recognized you.

12:07.977 --> 12:11.230
And, uh, I believe your fist
already met Vic's face.
[chuckles]

12:12.231 --> 12:13.524
[exhales]

12:13.524 --> 12:15.192
Sorry about that.

12:15.192 --> 12:16.360
[Cliff] Ah, he's fine.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.820
Happens all the time.

12:18.737 --> 12:19.738
Forget about it.

12:19.738 --> 12:20.698
[Kory exhales]

12:21.907 --> 12:24.368
[whispers] Gar, where are we?

12:24.368 --> 12:25.661
Oh.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.079
We're in my house,

12:28.456 --> 12:29.331
but we're not.

12:30.750 --> 12:31.625
But we are.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.797
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to just make, like,

12:37.590 --> 12:39.216
100% more sense.

12:39.216 --> 12:41.010
[Larry] May as well
join the party.

12:41.010 --> 12:44.180
Not making sense is kind of how
we roll around here.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.639
[sarcastically]
Yeah, thank you.

12:45.639 --> 12:47.516
But we can't stay.

12:48.726 --> 12:49.727
Sure, you can.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.023
Sorry, Kory.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.275
We're trapped here.

12:57.026 --> 12:57.902
[chuckles]

13:05.951 --> 13:06.827
[exhales]

13:10.122 --> 13:12.625
[Conner] I call this
programmers' playhouse,

13:13.626 --> 13:15.461
courtesy of the new LexCorp.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.546
All for you.

13:17.546 --> 13:20.591
The worker bees have already
implemented your code.

13:20.591 --> 13:22.384
Assets built.

13:22.384 --> 13:27.056
Once you review,
we instantly distribute
to anything running LexOS.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.850
From there,
word of mouth takes over.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.560
If your game is viable...

13:31.560 --> 13:33.604
[chuckles]
I don't see a limit
in consumer adoption.

13:35.105 --> 13:37.691
If the game is viable.

13:37.691 --> 13:41.153
We can lead consumers
to a game, but we can't
make them play it.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.113
Even corporate America
has its limits.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.617
And if it fails, what then?

13:48.994 --> 13:51.205
Be a laughingstock
all over the world?

13:53.374 --> 13:55.042
[breathing heavily]
I... I can't--

13:55.042 --> 13:56.669
- Hey.
- [breathing heavily]

13:56.669 --> 14:01.006
Failure is what happens
when we stop making attempts.

14:01.006 --> 14:04.468
If it doesn't succeed,
we iterate and try again.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.140
Can I have a moment alone?

14:13.477 --> 14:14.395
It's all a bit...

14:15.729 --> 14:17.231
overwhelming, you know?

14:19.024 --> 14:19.858
Of course.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.820
Take as long as you need.

14:22.820 --> 14:26.156
The, uh, green button
on the intercom goes direct
to the coffee bar.

14:27.157 --> 14:28.200
Try the cortado.

14:37.084 --> 14:37.960
[Dick] Hey, Rach.

14:40.170 --> 14:41.630
You got a second?

14:41.630 --> 14:42.965
I'm not that little kid
at the police station anymore.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.550
You don't need to give me
a jacket

14:44.550 --> 14:47.052
and tell me,

32:38.831 --> 32:39.624
[laughs]

32:39.624 --> 32:40.875
[sighs and chuckles]

32:40.875 --> 32:41.834
That's yours, Larry.

32:41.834 --> 32:43.211
I don't backhand.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.796
Time! Time!

32:46.506 --> 32:47.882
Okay, gut check.

32:47.882 --> 32:50.426
I know you both went through
horrible accidents.

32:50.426 --> 32:52.887
And I know we've never
completely answered
the question

32:52.887 --> 32:57.475
as to whether either of you
have a functional penis.

32:57.475 --> 32:59.727
[whispering] What do you
think they're talkin' about?

32:59.727 --> 33:01.354
[inhales slowly]

33:01.354 --> 33:03.439
I don't know
but whatever it is,
it won't help 'em.

33:03.439 --> 33:04.732
[laughs]

33:04.732 --> 33:06.859
But, and asking for a friend,

33:06.859 --> 33:09.987
could you try
not to suck so hard?

33:10.780 --> 33:12.156
Not a criticism.

33:12.156 --> 33:13.825
Remind me the last time
that you won Wimbledon?

33:13.825 --> 33:15.952
Or anything?

33:15.952 --> 33:17.453
[Gar] Are we playing?

33:17.453 --> 33:18.955
Yeah, okay, good. Good talk.

33:18.955 --> 33:21.332
All good! Good to go! Yeah!

33:21.332 --> 33:23.334
[Vic chuckles] Okay.
Just, just so I'm straight,

33:23.334 --> 33:26.212
you somehow
trap us in our own house,

33:26.212 --> 33:28.256
take a three-day nap,

33:28.256 --> 33:30.091
but your tennis game
can't wait?

33:30.091 --> 33:32.510
I didn't do this. [chuckles]

33:36.431 --> 33:37.265
[grunts]

33:40.393 --> 33:41.769
Come on, man!

33:41.769 --> 33:42.979
- [sighs]
- [Larry] Really?

33:42.979 --> 33:44.355
- [laughs]
- [Larry] Okay, is it me,

33:44.355 --> 33:46.315
or am I the only one
who actually wants

33:46.315 --> 33:48.651
to find a way out
of this hellscape?

33:48.651 --> 33:49.569
God!

33:50.194 --> 33:51.446
Ugh.

33:51.446 --> 33:52.447
Fuck yeah!

33:53.448 --> 33:55.241
Boom!

33:55.241 --> 33:58.035
Prepare to eat shit,
animal-vegetable-racquet-boy

33:58.035 --> 34:00.663
and mesmerizing alien woman
with the hammer punch.

34:00.663 --> 34:02.707
Let's go, parsley dip.

34:02.707 --> 34:03.791
Show me what you got.

34:03.791 --> 34:05.585
Oh, coming at you, T-Mobile!

34:06.878 --> 34:07.712
[grunts]

34:09.172 --> 34:10.798
[laughs]

34:10.798 --> 34:14.135
Have you, uh, ever heard of
the theory of "in and out?"

34:14.135 --> 34:15.595
[Vic] I have, actually.

34:15.595 --> 34:17.221
I learned it last night
when I was with your mom.

34:17.221 --> 34:19.307
Whoa! As your friend
and colleague,

34:19.307 --> 34:20.683
I need to advise you

34:20.683 --> 34:23.311
a solid, but inappropriate,
mom joke here

34:23.311 --> 34:26.147
cuts way against
the Cyborg brand.

34:28.524 --> 34:29.859
Are you fucking kidding me?

34:32.153 --> 34:34.280
Uh, I think you guys
should see this.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.282
You found a way out?

34:36.282 --> 34:37.283
Maybe.

34:44.749 --> 34:45.833
[Kory chuckles softly]

34:47.919 --> 34:48.878
You okay?

34:49.712 --> 34:51.047
Yeah, um...

34:53.758 --> 34:55.843
I think if me finding
some balance gets
us out of here,

34:55.843 --> 34:57.303
we're about
to leave. [chuckles]

34:57.929 --> 34:59.514
Really?

34:59.514 --> 35:00.723
[sputtering] What'd you find?

35:01.599 --> 35:02.767
Yeah, I just, um...

35:04.435 --> 35:07.438
Come on, you know
you can tell me anything.
[chuckles]

35:12.026 --> 35:14.362
I don't wanna go back
to another psychopath

35:15.738 --> 35:17.865
with a silly name
and too much power.

35:19.784 --> 35:20.827
But I know you.

35:21.994 --> 35:22.870
You're going to.

35:23.996 --> 35:24.872
[sighs]

35:28.000 --> 35:30.253
Ever since I didn't kill
Sebastian, I've been...

35:31.921 --> 35:34.507
thinking about how
I could've stopped all of this.

35:36.634 --> 35:37.593
Hating him.

35:38.469 --> 35:39.637
Judging myself.

35:41.222 --> 35:44.016
Something just clicked
for me while I was here.

35:45.518 --> 35:47.562
I don't need
to hate him to stop him.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.648
Goofing around with you guys
made me think about

35:50.648 --> 35:53.150
all the times I've had
so much fun with you,

35:54.193 --> 35:56.028
and Dick, and Rachel,

35:56.028 --> 35:58.656
and Krypto, and Conner.
And... [chuckles]

36:00.324 --> 36:02.493
And maybe that's
what I need to hold on to.

36:06.539 --> 36:08.875
I'm not going back
because I hate Sebastian.

36:11.752 --> 36:14.755
I'm going back because I love
what he's trying to destroy.

36:19.218 --> 36:20.344
[sighs]

36:28.394 --> 36:30.062
[sighs]

36:31.689 --> 36:32.815
What's happening to him?

36:32.815 --> 36:34.525
[Dr. Fabian] Well,
he's in a coma.

36:34.525 --> 36:35.818
We don't know the cause.

36:37.153 --> 36:39.363
And it's not just him.

36:39.363 --> 36:42.950
Whatever it is, it's happening
to people all over the world.

36:42.950 --> 36:45.411
Another crisis
to add to the pile.

36:45.411 --> 36:48.122
Until we can understand
the cause,

36:48.122 --> 36:49.415
this is everything we can do.

37:19.236 --> 37:20.655
[Dick] <i>Do you sense anything?</i>

37:20.655 --> 37:21.948
Left.

37:21.948 --> 37:22.907
<i>Go left.</i>

37:32.583 --> 37:33.793
[Kory scoffs]

37:33.793 --> 37:35.086
[Gar sniffs]

37:35.086 --> 37:37.505
- Wow, it smells like--
- Death.

37:37.505 --> 37:40.591
Whatever Sebastian's doing,
I think it's creeping in here.

37:41.842 --> 37:42.843
[Larry] Check this out.

37:48.849 --> 37:50.184
Never saw that before.

37:50.184 --> 37:51.227
Yeah, me either.

37:55.982 --> 37:59.235
Well, let's not look
a gift-back-door
in the asshole.

38:14.166 --> 38:16.585
Maybe The Red left me a message
in one of these books.

38:17.670 --> 38:19.213
[Vic] Oh,
I read that already.

38:19.213 --> 38:20.756
It says that we're trapped
because of you.

38:21.507 --> 38:22.341
Hm.

38:22.341 --> 38:23.259
[slams]

38:25.636 --> 38:26.429
[rumbling]

38:26.429 --> 38:27.847
[Kory] What's that?

38:27.847 --> 38:29.974
[Larry] If I'm lucky,
the end of everything.

38:34.562 --> 38:35.521
[grunts]

38:37.148 --> 38:38.899
Guys? Little help?

38:41.152 --> 38:42.820
[Cliff] Also, fuck you,
powers-that-be

38:42.820 --> 38:45.114
that brought Gar
back into our lives!

38:47.742 --> 38:48.617
Shit!

38:48.617 --> 38:50.119
Negative Spirit, release!

38:52.747 --> 38:53.831
I have an idea!

38:53.831 --> 38:55.583
Vic, I'm going
to need your help.

38:55.583 --> 38:56.792
Oh, so, now we're besties?

38:56.792 --> 38:58.169
Did you ever see
<i>Killers Trilogy?</i>

38:58.169 --> 38:59.420
What, you talkin' about
movies now?

38:59.420 --> 39:00.421
- Come on, man!
- Okay. Which one?

39:00.421 --> 39:01.756
<i>A Killer's Response.</i>

39:01.756 --> 39:03.132
Oh, that's the best one
of the three.

39:03.132 --> 39:04.592
Agreed. At, at the end
of the movie,

39:04.592 --> 39:06.927
Sonny's in his cell.
He uses smuggled C-4 to--

39:06.927 --> 39:08.095
To blow off the roof.

39:08.095 --> 39:09.263
Exactly. Do you
still have the...

39:09.263 --> 39:10.347
[grunts] ...arm gun?

39:13.350 --> 39:15.269
Cannon.

39:15.269 --> 39:17.480
Larry's negative spirit
is lighting a spatial rift
at the top of the ceiling.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.273
If you hit it,
I think we're out.

39:19.273 --> 39:20.733
I... I don't see it.

39:20.733 --> 39:23.277
Aim at me.
I'll be your guidance system.

39:23.277 --> 39:24.320
You'll what?

39:24.320 --> 39:25.237
[grunts]

39:28.199 --> 39:29.200
[screeches]

39:30.534 --> 39:31.619
Oh, shit.

39:31.619 --> 39:34.246
[yells] Popping rivets
over here!

39:38.876 --> 39:39.919
What if I hit him?

39:39.919 --> 39:41.295
Just don't!

39:41.295 --> 39:42.505
[Cliff grunts]

39:42.505 --> 39:43.839
[Cliff] Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

39:43.839 --> 39:46.050
If we die, somebody
needs to know.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.635
Joan Jett once told me

39:47.635 --> 39:50.096
I danced in the sheets
like a jungle cat.

39:50.096 --> 39:51.680
Hand to God.

39:51.680 --> 39:52.640
Good to know.

39:53.516 --> 39:54.433
Clear, Gar!

39:55.142 --> 39:55.976
[grunts]

39:57.061 --> 39:57.937
Booyah!

40:00.981 --> 40:02.108
- [gags]
- [breathing heavily]

40:04.568 --> 40:05.694
Okay.

40:05.694 --> 40:06.737
So we're back?

40:07.571 --> 40:08.572
I hope so.

40:08.572 --> 40:09.990
[sighs in relief]

40:09.990 --> 40:11.951
- Thanks, Kory.
- Yeah. [chuckles]

40:11.951 --> 40:13.077
[Tim] Kory.

40:13.077 --> 40:14.370
Hey. Look who I brought
with me.

40:15.871 --> 40:16.872
Welcome back.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.291
Where were you?

40:19.291 --> 40:20.501
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.380
Tim, what's wrong?

40:24.380 --> 40:27.133
[sighs] I know what Sebastian
and Conner are doing.

40:29.051 --> 40:31.178
Every game has pathing.

40:31.178 --> 40:33.514
The ghosts in <i>Pac-Man</i>
moving along a set course,

40:33.514 --> 40:35.391
a long block in <i>Tetris.</i>

40:35.391 --> 40:37.935
But this game's player icon
always makes this pattern.

40:44.525 --> 40:46.694
That symbol was
at the Temple of Azarath.

40:46.694 --> 40:50.281
So Sebastian created a game
that's also a spell.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.158
[Tim] I'm thinking ritual.

40:52.158 --> 40:53.367
The players don't know it.

40:54.827 --> 40:56.036
Bernard didn't know it.

40:57.371 --> 40:58.581
But I think
it's killing people.

41:27.443 --> 41:28.319
[metal scrapes]

41:48.547 --> 41:50.007
Hey, behind you!
Behind you!

41:58.390 --> 41:59.433
[pants]

42:13.489 --> 42:15.157
I noticed you only pushed
the game out

42:15.157 --> 42:16.909
to players over 18.

42:16.909 --> 42:19.954
We can't leave
anyone out, Conner.
This is too important.

42:21.747 --> 42:23.207
That's a database of children

42:23.207 --> 42:25.501
with purchase access
to LexOS.

42:25.501 --> 42:29.547
Yeah, LexCorp has excellent
collection data
on all its customers.

42:30.339 --> 42:31.340
Naughty or nice,

42:32.466 --> 42:34.176
they will all take part.

42:35.719 --> 42:37.554
Listen,

42:37.554 --> 42:40.557
I was always left out
as a child.

42:40.557 --> 42:43.644
And I am not gonna
let that happen
to anyone else.

42:46.563 --> 42:47.398
Apple?

42:50.734 --> 42:53.362
"Suffer little children
to come unto me,

42:54.238 --> 42:56.073
and forbid them not."

43:01.120 --> 43:03.122
S.T.A.R. Labs can brute force
hack into LexCorp

43:03.122 --> 43:04.873
and corrupt their servers.

43:04.873 --> 43:07.167
And delete the game
on any device connected
to the Internet.

43:07.167 --> 43:10.129
If we can make it through
LexCorp's mainframe security.

43:10.129 --> 43:11.839
Sounds like a big "if."

43:14.591 --> 43:16.343
What?

43:16.343 --> 43:18.470
I think he is waiting
for you to give him
permission to do it.

43:18.470 --> 43:20.389
Technically, we'd be committing

43:20.389 --> 43:23.934
cyber-warfare against
a private corporation,
and that's a felony.

43:23.934 --> 43:26.145
Well, Sebastian
is killing the world

43:26.145 --> 43:27.605
with evil <i>Donkey Kong.</i>

43:28.647 --> 43:29.565
Break the law, Tim.

43:30.274 --> 43:31.275
Got it.

43:36.989 --> 43:38.240
[computer beeps]

43:40.409 --> 43:42.369
That's an external attack
on the server.

43:43.078 --> 43:43.912
By who?

43:49.001 --> 43:50.377
[Conner] It's triangulated.

43:50.377 --> 43:53.005
Location trace hasn't
isolated the source.

43:53.005 --> 43:54.631
Doesn't matter.

43:54.631 --> 43:57.468
I'm gonna give your
cyber-security
a little boost.

43:57.468 --> 43:58.594
[breathes deeply]

44:03.307 --> 44:04.892
[Kory] Wild guess,
it's not working.

44:04.892 --> 44:07.561
LexCorp's security
is blocking the brute force.

44:07.561 --> 44:08.854
Or Conner and Sebastian

44:08.854 --> 44:10.773
are catching on
and they're stopping it.

44:10.773 --> 44:14.151
Are we positive
I can't stop this by just
blowing something up?

44:15.944 --> 44:16.779
[sighs]

44:17.946 --> 44:19.531
Okay.

44:19.531 --> 44:21.658
You know, if only
there was some sort of...
[sighs] Forget it.

44:21.658 --> 44:23.243
No. Wh... What were you
going to say?

44:23.243 --> 44:24.661
[Tim] You know,
if somehow there
was some sort of,

44:24.661 --> 44:26.872
back door through
LexCorp's security.

44:29.208 --> 44:30.709
[chuckles] Back door.

44:32.169 --> 44:33.379
[Tim] Forget it.

44:33.379 --> 44:34.630
They'd never be that sloppy.

44:36.590 --> 44:37.466
Give it a try.

44:38.175 --> 44:39.009
Trust her.

44:40.844 --> 44:41.887
[grunts softly]

44:48.018 --> 44:49.061
[growling]

44:50.104 --> 44:51.105
[snarls]

44:59.613 --> 45:00.614
[beeping]

45:22.344 --> 45:23.220
[apple crunches]

45:25.681 --> 45:27.558
You chew very loudly.

45:29.393 --> 45:30.227
[chuckles]

45:31.854 --> 45:33.647
[automated voice]
<i>Invasion successful.</i>

45:33.647 --> 45:36.358
Oh, yeah. Yes.

45:36.358 --> 45:37.901
[Gar chuckles]

45:37.901 --> 45:39.570
Would you look at that?
There's a back door after all.

45:40.446 --> 45:41.321

It's all gone.

My game.

46:59.983 --> 47:00.943
My powers.

47:05.697 --> 47:07.741
[Dick] Are you okay?

47:07.741 --> 47:09.868
So when do I get
to meet your friend?

47:09.868 --> 47:11.745
He's not the kind of friend
you wanna have.

47:18.001 --> 47:19.211
Rachel?

47:19.211 --> 47:20.879
- [Sebastian gasps]
- What about Rachel?

47:22.339 --> 47:24.258
I can't feel her anymore.

47:27.678 --> 47:28.804
[shuddering] I can't feel...

47:35.018 --> 47:36.770
[Conner] I'm sorry, Sebastian.

47:50.075 --> 47:51.743
They still don't know
if he'll recover.

47:58.208 --> 48:00.627
Millions of people
would be hurt

48:00.627 --> 48:03.088
if you hadn't destroyed
Sebastian's game.

48:07.634 --> 48:08.969
Tim, you stopped him.

48:11.430 --> 48:13.265
Then why do I feel
so powerless?

Buddy.

- [chuckles]
- [Dick] You good?

48:34.911 --> 48:35.829
I'm good.

48:36.788 --> 48:37.831
Good to have you back.

48:37.831 --> 48:39.082
Ah, it's good to be back.

48:39.082 --> 48:42.252
So Conner's still
right next to Sebastian.

48:42.252 --> 48:43.712
And we don't know
what he's planning.

48:43.712 --> 48:46.381
I had a look at the event
protocol for Tim's hack.

48:46.381 --> 48:48.884
We didn't break their security.
Someone over there let us in.

48:49.593 --> 48:51.428
Conner?

48:51.428 --> 48:54.598
[sighs] I think the new CEO
of LexCorp is on our side.
