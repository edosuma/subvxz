WEBVTT

00:44.374 --> 00:46.669
[Grace] Frankie!

00:48.838 --> 00:50.798
Frankie!

00:50.881 --> 00:53.217
Oh, no... Frankie!

00:54.384 --> 00:55.886
Are you... oh!

00:59.723 --> 01:01.600
Are you ready?

01:01.684 --> 01:05.312
I don't want to be late. Frankie?

01:05.855 --> 01:09.025
That is some expressive brushwork
you got going on there, Byron.

01:09.108 --> 01:11.777
Every single stroke
is a choice to tell your truth.

01:11.861 --> 01:15.198
Mm. I love it when you...
you quote me.

01:16.949 --> 01:19.702
What an improvement,
Homer, over the eye.

01:19.785 --> 01:24.373
I can feel the sadness
and the mania.

01:24.456 --> 01:26.500
That wasn't what
I was going for at all.

01:26.583 --> 01:27.793
- Hmm.
- Psst!

01:27.877 --> 01:30.379
- Well...
- May I speak with you, please?

01:30.462 --> 01:32.048
Yeah. Uh, guys, this is Grace.

01:32.131 --> 01:34.383
Her husband is my husband's lover.

01:34.466 --> 01:35.968
For crying out loud...

01:36.052 --> 01:38.929
I'll tell you that love is cruel
but it teaches us who we are.

01:39.013 --> 01:40.264
Thank you.

01:40.389 --> 01:42.641
Why are you still here
with your convicts?

01:42.725 --> 01:46.103
- We have to leave in ten minutes.
- Ex-convicts.

01:46.187 --> 01:48.397
They've already served
their debt to society.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.982
I love the nightlife.

01:50.066 --> 01:53.777
Well, not Homer, but he's sick.
They had to let him out early.

01:53.861 --> 01:57.073
Okay, guys, wrap it up.
I have to go to a funeral.

01:57.156 --> 01:59.408
We have to get there early
and pay our respects

01:59.491 --> 02:00.784
before Robert and Sol get there.

02:00.868 --> 02:03.913
Listen, relax. Sol is
pathologically late.

02:03.996 --> 02:06.082
- Great work today, fellas.
- Bye, Frankie.

02:06.165 --> 02:09.710
- Thanks, Frankie.
- Okay, I'll see you all next week.

02:09.793 --> 02:11.587
- Good luck today.
- Yeah.

02:11.670 --> 02:15.174
- Usted estará en mi corazón.
- La vida es difícil ahora

02:15.258 --> 02:18.219
que Sol es homosexual con Roberto.

02:18.302 --> 02:22.056
Let's go! Vamos! Let's go!
We have to go.

02:22.139 --> 02:24.850
Stop rushing me.

02:25.976 --> 02:28.187
Couldn't we honor
Larry some other way?

02:28.271 --> 02:31.023
Like stay home, watch TV?

02:31.107 --> 02:34.443
Didn't Larry get Coyote into rehab
when there were no available beds?

02:34.526 --> 02:37.154
- Yes, he was a great guy.
- Yeah.

02:37.238 --> 02:39.907
He gave me and Robert
the down payment for our first house.

02:39.990 --> 02:42.034
I know, I know. We have to go.

02:42.118 --> 02:43.535
Well, if we don't leave
in nine minutes

02:43.619 --> 02:45.829
we're not going to be going
to Larry's funeral,

02:45.913 --> 02:48.958
we're going to be going to
Robert and Sol's coming out party.

02:49.041 --> 02:50.584
It's not a coming out party!

02:50.667 --> 02:52.253
[Sol] I know that!

02:52.336 --> 02:54.046
But it is the first time the world

02:54.130 --> 02:57.758
is going to see me
with you and not my wife.

02:57.841 --> 03:02.012
Not to mention,
my wife is also going to be there.

03:02.096 --> 03:03.722
Oh, God.

03:03.806 --> 03:06.016
Honey, we have to face it sometime.
Heads up.

03:06.100 --> 03:10.395
Why couldn't Larry have died on,
like, our fifth anniversary?

03:10.479 --> 03:13.316
Blame Sally,
she took him off the respirator.

03:13.398 --> 03:16.360
- She could have waited.
- Now listen to me!

03:16.443 --> 03:18.779
I'm quite sure that everyone
there will be focused

03:18.862 --> 03:22.199
on celebrating Larry's life
and not on us.

03:22.283 --> 03:25.119
Unless, of course, you insist
on wearing those dreadful shoes,

03:25.202 --> 03:27.496
in which case, yes,
everyone will be looking at us.

03:27.579 --> 03:30.624
- Nobody will be looking at us.
- Of course they will.

03:30.707 --> 03:34.086
People always want to know how the
left-behind wives are taking it.

03:34.170 --> 03:37.131
- I mean, wouldn't you?
- I'm not like that.

03:37.214 --> 03:41.426
- Everybody is. It's human nature.
- No, I am one-sixteenth Chippewa,

03:41.510 --> 03:45.472
that makes me part eagle,
that is not my nature.

03:45.555 --> 03:48.017
Is that why you're wearing
that ass-hugging dress?

03:48.100 --> 03:51.478
Exactly. Yes, when I walk
into Larry's house,

03:51.561 --> 03:54.523
everybody's going to look at me
and say, "What a waste!"

03:54.606 --> 03:56.900
Wouldn't they be saying that
when you walk out?

03:56.984 --> 04:01.238
- Will you just get dressed!
- I am dressed.

04:01.322 --> 04:03.324
You can't go in that.

04:04.325 --> 04:07.203
I cannot believe
you're going in those shoes.

04:07.286 --> 04:09.330
These are my comfort shoes.

04:09.413 --> 04:12.708
You wouldn't understand.
You don't have comfort clothing.

04:12.791 --> 04:14.626
Why do you need to be comfortable?

04:14.710 --> 04:17.796
The funeral's private, we're just going to
the house afterwards for the reception.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.755
These shoes connect me to the earth!

04:19.839 --> 04:23.093
Once my feet are grounded,
so goes the rest of me!

04:23.177 --> 04:25.262
Okay, sweetheart,
stop making yourself crazy.

04:25.346 --> 04:28.724
Right. Okay. I'll try.
Less of my meshugas.

04:28.807 --> 04:30.684
I'll l'chaim to that.

04:34.771 --> 04:36.523
Um, by the way,

04:36.606 --> 04:38.401
maybe we should have
some ground rules

04:38.483 --> 04:41.778
about how we want to be, um...
together.

04:41.862 --> 04:45.241
- What do you mean?
- So that we don't draw excess attention.

04:45.324 --> 04:47.410
Yeah. I wouldn't want
to upset Frankie.

04:47.492 --> 04:49.786
And I definitely don't want
to upset Grace.

04:49.870 --> 04:53.416
- But I also don't want to hide.
- I'm not saying that, sweetheart.

04:53.498 --> 04:57.294
All I'm saying is,
please, just be yourself.

04:57.378 --> 04:59.046
I can do that.

04:59.129 --> 05:02.632
- In fact, I'm already doing it.
- You certainly are.

05:02.716 --> 05:05.552
So what should we call each other?

05:05.635 --> 05:07.471
- I like "boyfriend." It's got kick.
- [laughing] No, no.

05:07.554 --> 05:10.724
We're too old for that.
"Longtime companion?"

05:10.807 --> 05:13.394
No, too retro-sad.

05:13.477 --> 05:17.398
It's from a time before famous people
would play gay in movies.

05:17.481 --> 05:22.152
Well, I can't just call you my
"friend" without doing this.

05:22.236 --> 05:24.321
- And I don't do this.
- "Soulmate?"

05:24.405 --> 05:28.492
No. I don't even like that one
when straight people use it.

05:29.743 --> 05:33.163
[Grace] Let's take my car. It's faster.
I can't floor it with these heels.

05:33.247 --> 05:34.706
You're going to have to drive.

05:34.790 --> 05:38.335
- It looks like you made those shoes.
- Look at this.

05:38.419 --> 05:40.921
Why are there caps
on all the water bottles?

05:41.004 --> 05:42.465
- Just leave it.
- My God,

05:42.547 --> 05:45.050
there are water bottles
and caps for days.

05:45.134 --> 05:49.263
- You're stalling.
- This is basic recycling.

05:49.346 --> 05:53.309
How quickly ecological entitlement
becomes environmental rape.

05:53.392 --> 05:56.103
You know something,
if you don't want to go, don't go.

05:56.186 --> 05:58.439
It's fine. I'll drive barefoot.

06:00.357 --> 06:03.527
Don't drive barefoot. I'm coming.

06:03.610 --> 06:06.238
Wait, wait.
We can't go there with our rings on.

06:06.322 --> 06:10.575
I don't know, I was going to wait until
the papers were signed and maybe

06:10.659 --> 06:14.163
- float them out to sea.
- I'm going to do it right now.

06:14.246 --> 06:16.665
I should have taken mine off weeks ago.
[inhales deeply]

06:17.666 --> 06:20.503
- Ah!
- Oh, my hand looks really weird.

06:21.670 --> 06:24.298
Okay, sister, I'm doing it, too.

06:24.381 --> 06:26.133
- Well, do it.
- I'm doing it!

06:27.176 --> 06:28.511
Do it!

06:30.429 --> 06:32.222
Take your hand out of your mouth.

06:32.306 --> 06:33.516
[both grunt]

06:34.599 --> 06:37.102
- We made it.
- Not too late.

06:37.186 --> 06:38.812
Come on, sign the guest book.
Sign it.

06:38.895 --> 06:40.189
- Hi, Margaret.
- Hi, Grace.

06:40.272 --> 06:41.440
Sign the guest book.

06:42.858 --> 06:45.319
Then we'll find Sally,
and get in and get out.

06:45.402 --> 06:48.071
I think that's her through there.

06:48.155 --> 06:50.199
Oh, look at all the people
waiting to talk to her.

06:52.075 --> 06:53.660
I can't even see the end of the line.

06:53.743 --> 06:56.288
We're never going to
get in and get out.

06:56.372 --> 06:57.789
It's your fault!

06:57.873 --> 07:00.417
You're the one who told me
to change clothes three times.

07:00.501 --> 07:03.628
Well, all your clothes reek of pot.

07:03.712 --> 07:07.466
Because I wear hemp,
not dead snakes on my feet.

07:07.550 --> 07:08.800
Oh, my God.

07:08.884 --> 07:13.389
Oh, God. I can't do this.

07:13.472 --> 07:16.308
- Yes, you can.
- No, no, I can't.

07:20.354 --> 07:22.981
You can't look either.

07:23.065 --> 07:26.485
- This is a mistake. Let's leave.
- Oh, no, no. We can't, not now.

07:26.569 --> 07:29.112
- Grace.
- Oh.

07:29.196 --> 07:31.073
- Sad, sad day.
- Yeah.

07:31.156 --> 07:33.450
- [toilet flushes]
- Larry's going to be missed.

07:33.534 --> 07:34.618
That's for sure.

07:36.786 --> 07:38.788
- Sorry.
- Are you kidding me?

07:38.872 --> 07:43.419
Frankie, Sol's wearing the tie
I gave Robert for Father's Day.

07:43.502 --> 07:46.296
They can't leave us
and share clothes.

07:46.380 --> 07:47.423
Let's go get in line.

07:49.258 --> 07:52.969
Would you look at them?
The life of the funeral party.

07:53.053 --> 07:56.014
Everything is so easy
for them, isn't it?

07:57.266 --> 07:59.726
Oh, well, yes, Robert is my partner.

07:59.809 --> 08:03.855
But not solely in the way you already
know him as my law partner...

08:03.939 --> 08:07.817
which he is still and we are,
but we are also

08:07.901 --> 08:12.864
homosexual law and bed partners
with each other.

08:12.948 --> 08:14.783
In life.

08:14.866 --> 08:17.160
Boy, this partner thing
is really confusing, isn't it?

08:17.244 --> 08:22.666
It is, right?
You people are utterly confused.

08:22.749 --> 08:24.460
They are now.

08:24.543 --> 08:27.921
I'm sorry. I messed it up.

08:29.172 --> 08:31.758
Please don't... do that.

08:40.558 --> 08:43.061
- Is your bladder empty?
- Yes, it is.

08:43.145 --> 08:45.021
Good, because we are
staying in this line

08:45.105 --> 08:47.774
and not moving
until we get to Sally.

08:47.857 --> 08:50.377
Then we'll tell her how much
we loved Larry and get out of here.

08:50.444 --> 08:54.281
I did love Larry.
He gave Sol his job at the firm.

08:54.364 --> 08:55.491
Robert, too.

08:57.409 --> 09:00.162
- Maybe it's Larry's fault.
- I blame Larry.

09:00.245 --> 09:02.289
- We're fine.
- Hi.

09:05.626 --> 09:07.294
Oh, my feet hurt!

09:10.213 --> 09:13.342
Why don't you take
those damned high heels off?

09:13.425 --> 09:16.219
Because they're part of this.

09:19.055 --> 09:20.182
Hmm.

09:26.730 --> 09:29.816
I gotta say, you boys really confused
the Brinkmans.

09:29.899 --> 09:32.528
Hey.
Your sister called us "boys"!

09:32.611 --> 09:33.862
- Oh, dear...
- What?

09:33.945 --> 09:35.105
He wants me to call him my...

09:35.155 --> 09:36.315
I don't want to get involved.

09:36.365 --> 09:38.158
- We're having nomenclature issues.
- No, no, no.

09:38.241 --> 09:39.784
What to call each other now
that we're out.

09:39.868 --> 09:42.245
- I can't help you with that.
- Robert!

09:42.329 --> 09:44.707
- Mr. Marlow, sir.
- Yes. How are you?

09:44.789 --> 09:47.000
- Good to see you boys.
- Good to see you!

09:47.083 --> 09:48.585
- Hi!
- Judge Foster.

09:48.669 --> 09:50.337
- Mr. Marlow.
- He called us boys.

09:50.420 --> 09:51.421
He's 105.

09:51.505 --> 09:54.257
You know, I have something
to say about Larry.

09:54.341 --> 09:56.760
He has great taste in Scotch.

09:56.843 --> 09:58.428
Yes, he did.

09:58.512 --> 10:02.182
Oh, and about you boys,
I know it's none of my business,

10:02.265 --> 10:06.895
but I think what you are doing
is just terrific. Very courageous.

10:06.978 --> 10:09.314
- I wish you a lot of luck.
- Thank you.

10:09.398 --> 10:10.733
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

10:12.359 --> 10:13.860
Could I ask you something?

10:13.943 --> 10:17.781
When did you first know
that you were attracted to men?

10:17.864 --> 10:21.451
I mean, I had an experience
when I was in Korea,

10:21.535 --> 10:25.205
but my wife thinks
it was just horseplay.

10:26.415 --> 10:30.711
- Oh, right...
- This is never going to end, is it?

10:30.794 --> 10:32.379
I thought we could do it in one day,

10:32.462 --> 10:35.006
but I am never not
going to be coming out, am I?

10:35.090 --> 10:40.136
It's just a good thing that Daddy's
dead because this would kill him.

10:40.220 --> 10:43.682
Probably. But you're okay with it.

10:43.766 --> 10:47.227
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Completely. It's all good.

10:47.310 --> 10:48.729
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

10:48.812 --> 10:53.442
Oh, my God.
Holy shit, Grace looks stunning.

10:53.525 --> 10:55.652
- Of course. She's perfect.
- Mm-hmm.

10:55.736 --> 10:57.738
- I'm just... Okay. Yeah.
- Go ahead.

11:00.031 --> 11:03.868
[woman] Grace! Ahh! So good to see you.

11:03.952 --> 11:07.205
- Hi. Oh, I missed you so much.
- Oh, golly.

11:07.289 --> 11:09.625
- Me, too.
- Good to see you too, Frankie.

11:09.708 --> 11:11.794
Very cute funeral outfit.

11:11.876 --> 11:14.296
Would you save our place in line?
And here, hold this.

11:14.379 --> 11:16.715
Why do I have to wait in line?

11:16.799 --> 11:18.883
Because I'm walking away.

11:25.682 --> 11:28.560
- Frankie?
- Judy!

11:28.644 --> 11:30.979
- I thought that was you.
- And Peter, too?

11:31.062 --> 11:33.523
I'm so glad to see you guys!

11:33.607 --> 11:36.485
This is going to sound awful, but I
was hoping I'd see you here today.

11:36.568 --> 11:38.236
Put 'er there, pal.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.113
Oh...

11:40.196 --> 11:43.867
Gadzooks!
I forgot you are such a gifted hugger.

11:43.950 --> 11:48.413
Nothing like somebody dying to make
you appreciate the love you've got.

11:48.497 --> 11:50.666
- Mm-hmm.
- Speaking of that, where... where's Sol?

11:50.749 --> 11:52.876
Honey, I already told you.

11:52.959 --> 11:56.087
Told me what? Oh, my God.
Did Sol die, too?

11:56.171 --> 11:59.215
No, no, he's over there
drinking a Johnny Walker neat.

11:59.299 --> 12:02.719
Yeah, I told you, honey. Remember?
He's with Robert now...

12:02.803 --> 12:05.138
- I thought you were joking.
- Really?

12:05.221 --> 12:08.099
Why would I joke about that?
Why would anyone joke about that?

12:08.183 --> 12:10.477
No one would joke about that.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.897
Wow.
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

12:13.980 --> 12:16.733
- It's a lot, isn't it?
- Yeah.

12:16.817 --> 12:20.445
Would you excuse me? I have to
count the bulbs on the chandelier.

12:20.529 --> 12:23.448
- It's a hobby of mine. Bye.
- Bye.

12:23.532 --> 12:24.533
We'll see ya.

12:41.341 --> 12:46.304
That looked like a perfect storm
over there with Judy and Peter.

12:46.388 --> 12:47.890
Padre, excuse me.

12:47.931 --> 12:51.059
If you're going to the kitchen
could you get me two whiskey sours?

12:51.142 --> 12:53.019
One for each hand.

12:54.270 --> 12:56.940
When Larry died,
the first thing I thought of was you

12:57.023 --> 13:00.068
because I knew you would come
even if you didn't want to.

13:00.151 --> 13:03.363
I am really sorry you have to deal
with all this stuff.

13:03.446 --> 13:05.657
I wish there was something
I could do to make it easier.

13:06.783 --> 13:08.702
- But I'm fine.
- You are?

13:08.785 --> 13:10.412
Well, let's see...

13:10.495 --> 13:13.665
I am standing here, I'm talking
to you, my head has not exploded.

13:13.749 --> 13:15.625
Oh, that's... good.

13:15.709 --> 13:21.172
[chuckles] It is good, isn't it?
Because, oh, my God, when you first left?

13:21.256 --> 13:23.967
- I was, like, "My life is over."
- [sighs]

13:24.050 --> 13:28.847
"I cannot sleep in that big
fucking bed without him."

13:28.931 --> 13:33.309
But I did it. Now I love
having that bed to myself.

13:33.393 --> 13:34.770
It's fantastic.

13:34.853 --> 13:37.606
I sleep in a giant "X"!

13:38.774 --> 13:42.360
You know what this means?
It means I'm okay.

13:42.444 --> 13:45.655
And I'm going to be okay.
Because I'm moving on.

13:46.573 --> 13:51.411
- Ta-da! Congratulate me.
- Okay, well... mazel tov.

13:51.494 --> 13:54.873
Thank you.
Here, let me switch with you.

13:56.332 --> 13:59.795
Put that in there for me.
Excuse me.

13:59.878 --> 14:02.881
Uh-oh, uh-oh,
this is where my place is.

14:10.889 --> 14:13.391
You're mad at me
for not calling you, aren't you?

14:13.475 --> 14:14.810
I-I-I don't blame you.

14:14.893 --> 14:16.937
See, I thought that I wanted
to give you space,

14:17.020 --> 14:20.899
but now I think I was in complete
shock and wanted to give me space.

14:20.983 --> 14:22.191
I'm sorry.

14:22.275 --> 14:26.195
Honey, it's fine.
I wouldn't have called me either.

14:26.279 --> 14:30.951
Oh, my God, I adore you.
[laughs]

14:31.034 --> 14:34.203
If it makes you feel any better,
none of us knew about Robert.

14:34.287 --> 14:37.874
I mean, I grew up with the guy,
and I had no idea.

14:37.958 --> 14:40.877
- You weren't sleeping with him.
- And you were?

14:40.961 --> 14:45.423
Well, maybe four times a year.
It was seasonal.

14:45.507 --> 14:47.258
[both laugh]

14:47.342 --> 14:50.345
Well, that's more than me
and my husband are having sex.

14:50.428 --> 14:53.473
- Who knows? Maybe he's gay.
- No, no. You would know.

14:53.556 --> 14:54.956
- I would?
- Oh, you know you would.

14:54.975 --> 14:56.810
Okay, yeah.

14:56.893 --> 15:00.022
God, I was inside it and I didn't see.

15:01.064 --> 15:05.485
- Am I that self-involved?
- No, honey, he's that opaque.

15:09.948 --> 15:12.575
Jesus... go ahead of me.

15:18.331 --> 15:20.667
[man] We miss Larry.
One of the best.

15:21.459 --> 15:23.378
- [cell phone ringing]
- [laughing]

15:28.216 --> 15:29.258
Hello?

15:29.342 --> 15:31.761
I've been waiting in line
for over an hour.

15:31.845 --> 15:33.930
Now we're at the front
and you're not even here.

15:34.014 --> 15:37.809
Look, I needed some time to myself.
It's a...

15:39.978 --> 15:41.604
lot to process.

15:41.688 --> 15:45.942
I can see you out the window
drinking a martini with Lydia!

15:46.026 --> 15:47.318
Are you spying on me?

15:47.402 --> 15:52.074
Yes, Miss Marple, I've been tailing
you all day from inside a plant!

15:52.156 --> 15:55.952
I can see you making
that "blah-blah" gesture...

15:56.995 --> 15:59.122
- I've gotta go.
- Oh, it's "get in, get out"

15:59.205 --> 16:01.666
when you want it to be to
get in, get out. When I want--

16:03.585 --> 16:06.462
Fine. I'll talk to Sally myself.

16:10.884 --> 16:13.302
- She's going to take a little break.
- For how long?

16:13.386 --> 16:15.055
Excuse me?

16:15.138 --> 16:19.142
For how long...
will I feel this sadness for Larry?

16:19.225 --> 16:21.770
- Aww.
- Thank you.

16:24.147 --> 16:25.231
[quietly] Fuck.

16:25.314 --> 16:26.399
[sighs]

16:34.198 --> 16:35.658
Oh. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

16:36.910 --> 16:38.787
I'm sorry, little boy.

16:38.870 --> 16:41.790
I've been waiting a very long time
to talk to Mrs. Harris

16:41.873 --> 16:44.500
and I can't account for you
to cut in front of me.

16:44.584 --> 16:47.545
What are you going
to say to her anyway?

16:47.629 --> 16:49.589
What is there to say, right?

16:49.672 --> 16:53.217
That I hope great-grandpa Larry
feels all my love

16:53.301 --> 16:57.722
because it's as big as a million kisses
from a million angels in heaven.

16:57.806 --> 17:02.018
Hmm. Well, I guess that's
better than nothing.

17:02.102 --> 17:03.227
[woman] Is that her?

17:03.311 --> 17:06.396
[woman 2] How could you be married
to someone for that long and not...?

17:06.481 --> 17:08.691
- Are they talking about you?
- Yes, they are.

17:08.775 --> 17:11.194
- Are you famous?
- Today I think I am.

17:11.277 --> 17:13.946
- Can I have your autograph?
- Go get a Sharpie.

17:15.991 --> 17:19.828
Hi, do any of you
bitches have some gum?

17:19.911 --> 17:24.624
- Grandpa would have been so touched.
- Oh, gosh, that is loaded with aspartame.

17:24.707 --> 17:27.210
It will literally eat your guts out.

17:27.292 --> 17:28.419
Enjoy!

17:29.963 --> 17:32.048
Sweet muscular Jesus.

17:32.132 --> 17:34.258
Would you save my place for me?

17:34.342 --> 17:36.636
Please let us know
if there's anything we can do.

17:36.719 --> 17:39.931
Seriously. Consider me on call.

17:40.015 --> 17:44.936
Just say the word and I can come over
with a sandwich or a shoulder to cry on.

17:45.020 --> 17:47.271
- I mean it.
- Thank you, Robert.

17:47.355 --> 17:51.985
I'm Sol, but if it's easier for you
to call me Robert right now,

17:52.068 --> 17:55.488
I support that.
I'm wearing his tie anyway.

17:56.656 --> 17:58.449
Just a sec.

17:58.533 --> 18:01.995
- So, are you getting rest?
- A little.

18:02.078 --> 18:05.123
- Is it okay that I took your hand?
- Of course.

18:05.207 --> 18:08.168
When can you get together?
I want to see your girls, too.

18:08.251 --> 18:11.796
- Maybe we could all have lunch?
- I am wide open.

18:11.880 --> 18:14.423
Yeah! I'd really love to do it
next weekend but that's...

18:14.507 --> 18:17.593
sorry... that's Connie's shower. So...

18:17.677 --> 18:23.516
Oh, that's right. Oh, my gosh, I can't
believe your baby's all grown up.

18:23.599 --> 18:27.603
Do you have everything you need? Do
you want me to bring... centerpieces?

18:27.687 --> 18:30.190
Yeah, um...

18:31.357 --> 18:34.569
Honey, you know... it's just now,

18:34.652 --> 18:37.280
with the stuff with Robert and Sol...

18:37.363 --> 18:39.824
I mean, you're still welcome to come,
of course,

18:39.908 --> 18:42.660
it's just Mother will be there
and all the aunties,

18:42.744 --> 18:44.495
and they're going to
bring their kids...

18:44.579 --> 18:46.748
I just thought, for your sake,
it might just be a little...

18:46.831 --> 18:48.332
- Yeah, awkward.
- Awkward.

18:48.416 --> 18:50.919
You know how everyone can be, right?

18:51.002 --> 18:54.630
And it's just...
it's Connie's special day, so...

18:54.714 --> 18:57.550
You understand, right?
If anyone would.

18:57.633 --> 19:01.054
Of course. It's a family thing.
I completely understand.

19:01.137 --> 19:04.974
Oh, my God, I do,
I love you so much.

19:05.058 --> 19:06.851
I'll be in touch, okay?

19:20.823 --> 19:24.994
And that's another thing,
don't be afraid to let yourself cry.

19:25.078 --> 19:29.916
If you can. It's corny, but tears
really are the holiest of water.

19:29.999 --> 19:32.168
But you'll also want to hydrate.

19:32.252 --> 19:35.338
Sally, it's been wonderful
to spend this time with you.

19:35.421 --> 19:37.632
And please forgive us
for taking up so much of it.

19:37.715 --> 19:40.343
It's fine, Robert.
I'll tell you something.

19:40.426 --> 19:44.764
When my dad died, I found that
a very small dose of Lexapro

19:44.847 --> 19:49.102
mixed in with some ice cream really helped
me jump-start my way out of my grief.

19:49.185 --> 19:51.354
Take good care, sweetheart.
Our prayers are with you.

19:51.437 --> 19:54.649
- Thank you, dear.
- We'll check on you tomorrow. God bless.

19:55.858 --> 19:56.943
What are you doing?

19:57.026 --> 19:58.746
You're not supposed
to monopolize the widow.

19:58.820 --> 20:01.030
- I was comforting her.
- You were exhausting her.

20:01.114 --> 20:03.574
Why are you upset? I've been
sticking to the ground rules--

20:03.658 --> 20:07.912
Great! But what about
all that other stuff?

20:07.996 --> 20:09.756
- What other stuff?!
- Like that other stuff!

20:09.831 --> 20:11.749
- You're too loud.
- You said to be myself.

20:11.833 --> 20:13.751
- I can't hear you.
- You said to be myself!

20:13.835 --> 20:16.254
Okay. But less of yourself
because it's too much.

20:16.338 --> 20:19.507
You're too much. Too much talking,
and over-sharing, and hugging.

20:19.590 --> 20:22.385
And I'm sorry, but I told you
those shoes are inappropriate.

20:22.468 --> 20:24.846
Do you see anyone in this room
with shoes like that?

20:24.929 --> 20:28.183
- I've worn them a million times.
- But not with me.

20:28.266 --> 20:30.977
- Not with you.
- It's embarrassing!

20:31.060 --> 20:34.647
This is a somber business gathering.
There are ways of doing things.

20:34.730 --> 20:37.525
Social mores that bind us together
and organize the way--

20:37.608 --> 20:40.486
Ah! Never mind!
You're just not doing anything right!

20:40.569 --> 20:42.405
You're... You're...

20:51.914 --> 20:53.375
Oh, my God.

20:54.834 --> 20:57.503
You're angry I'm not Grace.

20:59.214 --> 21:03.634
There was nothing like walking
into a room with that woman.

21:03.718 --> 21:04.677
[sighs]

21:06.721 --> 21:07.763
You miss her.

21:10.225 --> 21:11.767
[sighs]

21:20.818 --> 21:24.447
I am so sorry for your loss.

21:27.283 --> 21:30.536
I have my own, so I understand.

21:30.619 --> 21:31.620
[sobbing]

21:31.704 --> 21:34.498
But... sweetheart...

21:34.582 --> 21:36.167
What?

21:36.251 --> 21:38.669
I'm not her.

21:38.753 --> 21:41.797
I will always talk too loud
and hug too much.

21:41.881 --> 21:47.303
And even if it's a business gathering
for a professional colleague,

21:47.387 --> 21:50.723
there will always be meshugas.

21:50.806 --> 21:53.684
Isn't that what we want out of life?

21:59.648 --> 22:02.193
- Yeah.
- [sobs] I'm sorry.

22:02.277 --> 22:04.446
Please forgive me.

22:06.114 --> 22:07.198
You know I love you.

22:09.367 --> 22:12.412
He's my boyfriend. [laughing]

22:12.495 --> 22:16.582
Oh, I am so sad for you.

22:16.665 --> 22:20.169
Larry always made me laugh.
I really dug your husband.

22:20.253 --> 22:22.088
I really dug him, too.

22:22.171 --> 22:25.133
I can't imagine
what you are going through.

22:25.216 --> 22:29.220
Oh. I think your situation
is much worse, dear.

22:29.304 --> 22:30.388
Mmm.

22:30.472 --> 22:32.515
- Pardon?
- I'll be dead soon,

22:32.640 --> 22:34.183
but what are you going to do?

22:34.267 --> 22:36.436
You may live another 20 years.

22:36.519 --> 22:38.646
Oh, well...

22:38.729 --> 22:40.815
Oh! Dear, thank you.

22:40.898 --> 22:42.525
Come on. Time's out.

22:42.608 --> 22:44.319
I've had enough of this affair.

22:44.402 --> 22:46.862
I'll go get our wraps
and pull the car around.

22:46.946 --> 22:49.657
Oh, don't you want
to pay your respects to the...?

22:50.950 --> 22:53.202
Hi, Sally. So sorry, Sally.

22:53.286 --> 22:55.163
There. Let's move.

22:55.246 --> 22:57.748
- God, I'm glad to see you.
- [Grace] Me, too.

23:07.133 --> 23:09.135
[Robert] You look beautiful.

23:12.013 --> 23:13.222
[grunts]

23:14.432 --> 23:16.392
I am so mad at you.

23:16.476 --> 23:20.104
You get to be happy now, don't you?

23:20.188 --> 23:23.274
- You're not losing anything.
- That's not true.

23:23.358 --> 23:26.819
Oh, really? You have everything.

23:26.902 --> 23:29.405
A week after you left,
you had dinner with the kids

23:29.489 --> 23:32.408
just like it was any old Tuesday.

23:32.492 --> 23:35.995
Yeah. I know about that.

23:36.078 --> 23:39.541
So what are you losing, exactly?

23:39.623 --> 23:43.252
Because I've lost my marriage,
my extended family,

23:43.336 --> 23:45.796
my own family is broken up.

23:45.880 --> 23:48.174
And I don't know if you know this,

23:48.257 --> 23:52.136
but I just lost my best friend.

23:52.220 --> 23:54.805
And all I get is stuck with Frankie!

23:54.889 --> 23:58.976
[grunts] Oh, shoot!

23:59.060 --> 24:02.104
- I don't think she heard.
- I don't know. Shoot!

24:05.400 --> 24:07.985
Frankie! Frankie!

24:08.069 --> 24:11.072
- Don't you want your scarf?
- Oh, I'm okay. I'm fine.

24:17.036 --> 24:18.787
Frankie? Scarf?

24:23.834 --> 24:24.835
[sighs]

24:29.048 --> 24:30.299
Oh, God.

24:35.054 --> 24:37.599
I think this is for you.

24:41.936 --> 24:43.938
Let's go home.
