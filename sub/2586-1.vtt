00:51.400 --> 00:53.562
<i>I'm not gonna make excuses.</i>

00:59.040 --> 01:00.690
<i>I asked for this.</i>

01:03.520 --> 01:04.885
<i>All of it.</i>

01:11.960 --> 01:14.645
<i>And I did it to become someone else.</i>

01:21.080 --> 01:22.844
<i>I wanted more.</i>

01:33.600 --> 01:38.242
<i>We belong to a generation that watched
our future get stolen out from under us.</i>

01:40.120 --> 01:43.090
<i>The American Dream our parents knew
has been hijacked by men</i>

01:43.240 --> 01:47.564
<i>who are willing to lie, cheat and steal
to protect their wealth.</i>

01:49.320 --> 01:53.325
<i>Used to be if you got good grades,
you got into the right school,</i>

01:53.480 --> 01:54.970
<i>got the right job.</i>

01:55.120 --> 01:58.124
<i>And after 15 years of hard work,</i>

01:58.280 --> 02:00.009
<i>you get your name on the door.</i>

02:02.280 --> 02:04.089
<i>But that world is gone.</i>

02:07.520 --> 02:10.205
<i>People always tell you
be careful what you wish for.</i>

02:12.000 --> 02:13.445
<i>I never believed them.</i>

02:15.080 --> 02:17.731
<i>The lights always looked brighter
across the river.</i>

03:03.400 --> 03:05.004
Hey, come on!

03:05.200 --> 03:06.804
Hey, I'm coming. Chill.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.204
I'm paying extra for that?

03:13.360 --> 03:15.283
Don't worry, it's covered, Scout.

03:15.440 --> 03:18.046
- Nothing's covered, Dad.
- Where you going?

03:18.200 --> 03:19.519
I'm going to the club with Kev.

03:19.520 --> 03:21.682
- Which one?
- Why? You think you might know it?

03:21.840 --> 03:26.004
Well, I have been known to frequent
discotheques in my heyday.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.891
They don't call them that
anymore, but that's good.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.042
Hey, don't let him smoke. He hides
cigars under that cushion there.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.964
Don't smoke!

03:33.120 --> 03:34.929
What's the matter? You jealous?

03:35.080 --> 03:37.401
Oh, yes.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.924
Club Rise, baby.
What took you so long?

03:47.800 --> 03:50.121
Why don't you do yourself a favor
and lift the rope?

03:50.280 --> 03:52.647
And how is that
doing me a favor?

03:52.800 --> 03:54.086
Consider it an investment.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.083
Come Monday, my boy and I
will be making so much money,

03:56.240 --> 03:59.040
you'll be begging us to come back
to this flavor of the month of yours.

04:00.280 --> 04:04.080
Look, no hipsters
and no virgins.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.004
Virgin?

04:06.160 --> 04:08.686
He's not a virgin.
I just watched him get laid outside.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.808
I watched it,
I literally saw him get laid.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.928
- Adam, come on.
- I saw him with my own eyes.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.969
I'm going to be back.

04:16.240 --> 04:20.086
Are you nervous yet?

04:20.279 --> 04:22.647
Nervous? About what?

04:22.800 --> 04:26.964
On Monday we pitch our product
to Nicolas freaking Wyatt, that's what.

04:27.360 --> 04:31.126
Kevin, we've been working on that pitch
for four months. It's genius.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.679
The only thing
I'm worried about is

04:32.680 --> 04:35.251
who Wyatt's gonna fire
for not promoting us sooner.

04:36.600 --> 04:40.127
How great is it gonna be
to pay our bills

04:40.280 --> 04:42.123
and eat in the same month?

04:42.280 --> 04:44.089
Oh, get ready
'cause it's happening.

04:44.240 --> 04:47.483
You always say it's happening,
and then I end up paying for the cab.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.842
This time's different.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.810
This pitch,
it's gonna change our lives.

04:53.560 --> 04:54.686
Promise you.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.729
But I'm still paying for the cab, right?

04:56.880 --> 04:58.484
- Yeah.
- Got you.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.450
It's not me.

05:18.560 --> 05:19.402
Hello?

05:21.680 --> 05:23.284
Yeah, I'll be right there.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.520
Sir, can you turn around? We need
to go to Saint Joe's Hospital.

05:31.920 --> 05:33.843
Adam, he's doing great.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.526
He's up to his old tricks.
He's right through there.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.446
We cleared out
the mucus, and he's fine.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.443
But he must use
the oxygen more,

05:46.600 --> 05:49.206
and he has to call us
at the onset of congestion.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.842
- Yeah, he knows.
- Wants to do it his own way, huh?

05:53.040 --> 05:54.201
Yeah.

05:54.360 --> 05:57.204
- You can take him home.
- All right. Thanks.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.170
As you can see, Mr. Cassidy,

06:01.320 --> 06:05.166
the last two procedures
were not covered by insurance.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.528
What do you mean?
I have extended coverage.

06:09.360 --> 06:12.330
You did.
Wyatt Corp terminated it.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.204
They can't do that. I have it.
I need to have it.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.169
Unfortunately, they can.

06:20.320 --> 06:23.164
A lot of our companies
are doing it now, cutbacks.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.247
I don't have 40 grand.

06:28.400 --> 06:31.768
We can help with a payment plan,
or a medical loan.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.370
I'm really sorry.

06:35.200 --> 06:39.364
Yeah. I'll figure something out.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.441
We did everything we could.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.688
<i>We work for Wyatt Corp,</i>

06:57.840 --> 07:00.241
<i>one of the top tech companies
on the planet.</i>

07:03.440 --> 07:06.364
<i>When they hired us,
we were going to take over the world.</i>

07:09.400 --> 07:12.643
<i>Six years in,
we were still just lowly cubicle drones,</i>

07:12.800 --> 07:15.531
<i>watching our bosses take home
obscene bonuses...</i>

07:17.080 --> 07:20.402
<i>...while we were stuck
with entry-level salaries.</i>

07:22.280 --> 07:25.170
<i>We'd waited long enough.
It was our turn.</i>

07:25.320 --> 07:27.402
<i>Our time to shine.</i>

07:35.440 --> 07:36.601
You all right?

07:37.240 --> 07:38.924
Yeah. We're gonna kill it.

07:39.080 --> 07:43.449
Yeah, well, if things go south,
just stay cool. All right?

07:44.240 --> 07:45.287
Yeah.

07:45.480 --> 07:46.891
Mr. Wyatt is ready.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.445
Stay cool.

07:53.160 --> 07:54.446
Good morning.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.569
We are all in the business
of connecting people.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.245
This water's not hot enough.

08:12.120 --> 08:14.080
I'm sorry, Mr. Wyatt.
I'll take care of it.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.646
It should be boiling.

08:19.320 --> 08:21.368
Uh... We're in the business
of connecting people.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.244
You already said that.

08:25.720 --> 08:29.486
Right. That's what our customers have
always wanted. To stay connected.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.166
Those same customers are now texting
more than they're talking

08:32.360 --> 08:33.691
and tweeting more
than they're meeting.

08:33.840 --> 08:36.207
So, what's changed?
What are we missing?

08:36.360 --> 08:38.966
We don't want to be
connected anymore.

08:39.159 --> 08:41.128
We just want to feel connected
while we isolate.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.486
So, what if...

08:44.520 --> 08:47.364
...a four-inch mobile had
a 60-inch screen?

08:47.520 --> 08:52.208
Well, then it wouldn't be mobile.

08:52.360 --> 08:55.284
With a voice-activated pairing device,
Ethion will allow users

08:55.440 --> 08:58.364
to broadcast their mobile
across any monitor in the home.

08:58.520 --> 08:59.521
Pick up.

09:01.120 --> 09:04.522
Ethion 3.0 gives you the power
to bring your world to you.

09:04.680 --> 09:06.682
Is he pitching me software?

09:08.040 --> 09:11.726
Sir, we see a unique opportunity to take
Ethion from a run-of-the-mill phone...

09:11.880 --> 09:14.929
This is a re-branding meeting.
Where's the disconnect?

09:18.560 --> 09:22.281
Well, sir, I believe the disconnect is
between you and the consumers.

09:25.560 --> 09:29.087
You didn't hire us to sit around
and watch you make tea, did you?

09:34.280 --> 09:36.408
Tell me, why did I hire you?

09:36.560 --> 09:38.440
Because we know
what a younger generation wants.

09:38.560 --> 09:39.527
Which is?

09:39.720 --> 09:41.643
A phone that doesn't just look new
a phone that is new,

09:41.800 --> 09:44.690
a phone that changes the way we live.

09:44.840 --> 09:47.446
You know, you're right.
I have lost touch with your generation.

09:47.600 --> 09:48.806
What was your name again?

09:48.960 --> 09:50.450
I'm Adam Cassidy.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.806
How old are you?

09:51.960 --> 09:53.405
Twenty-seven.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.399
When I was two years younger
than you are now,

09:55.400 --> 09:58.085
I was pioneering
digital cellular technology

09:58.280 --> 10:01.204
while my colleagues were still pissing
around with electronic pulses.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.646
I had vision.

10:02.800 --> 10:06.521
But you have all the technological
advantage imaginable

10:06.680 --> 10:08.967
and what do you bring me?

10:09.120 --> 10:11.885
Social networking on a television.

10:12.040 --> 10:15.487
Next! Bring in Richard McAllister.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.011
I'm sorry, guys.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.606
You just left us standing there
looking like idiots.

10:37.760 --> 10:39.842
I mean, what were you thinking?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.480
<i>We all backed the idea.</i>

10:42.640 --> 10:47.202
<i>Our idea wasn't the problem.
I railroaded him. You saw his face.</i>

10:47.360 --> 10:50.603
<i>That's what happens when your team
leader goes rogue and argues with God.</i>

10:55.160 --> 10:58.369
Well, uh... I guess now
that we're not working together

10:58.520 --> 11:00.488
we can start sleeping
together, right?

11:00.680 --> 11:02.682
I seriously hope
you're not talking to me.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.763
We'll find new jobs, right?

11:04.920 --> 11:06.684
We weren't laid off,
Chels. We were fired.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.491
How are you going to explain
that on your resume?

11:14.120 --> 11:17.681
You know what? The least I can do
is buy you guys a few drinks.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.524
Our discretionary account? Really?

11:19.680 --> 11:22.968
Adam, no. If Wyatt ever found out
that we spent any more money...

11:23.160 --> 11:24.400
What are they going to do? Fire us?

11:24.560 --> 11:28.121
The money was ours to spend
as we see fit. We're going to Rise.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.362
- We can't get in there.
- Yes, we can.

11:30.520 --> 11:33.649
- Yes, we can.
- Try and stop the guy.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.724
We're going to Rise,
baby! Oh, yeah!

11:51.880 --> 11:54.201
Dude, you realize this is
going to be so awesome.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.160
- We're going to pop ten bottles.
- Think so?

11:56.280 --> 11:58.408
I hate this doorman.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.691
Adam Cassidy.
Told you I'd be back.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.370
Your table's right this way, sir.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.409
Yeah!

12:10.560 --> 12:13.370
- Yeah!
- Oh!

12:13.520 --> 12:15.170
- Shots!
- Shots!

12:15.320 --> 12:16.845
- Shots!
- Oh my God.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.650
Ooh!

12:19.320 --> 12:22.051
If you guys don't get lucky tonight,
it's never going to happen.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.043
I'm fielding offers. You want in?

12:24.920 --> 12:27.321
See me after.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.480
- Cheers, guys!
- Whoo!

12:34.160 --> 12:35.650
Yeah!

12:35.800 --> 12:38.121
Adam, maybe
we should close out the tab.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.601
Hey, don't worry about it, man,
don't worry about it.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.330
Hey, can we get
another bottle of Ciroc?

12:43.280 --> 12:45.726
- Twirl me!
- No, no, no.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.607
Come on!

13:23.800 --> 13:26.371
Hey, buddy, where you going?

13:27.560 --> 13:29.528
Could be love.

14:13.360 --> 14:14.521
Wake up.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.728
Hey, wake up.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.287
- Hmm?
- I have to go.

14:26.440 --> 14:27.885
So do you.

14:31.680 --> 14:32.886
No breakfast?

14:34.040 --> 14:36.646
Did I, uh, do something wrong?

14:36.800 --> 14:40.566
If you had done something wrong,
you wouldn't be here, would you?

14:42.040 --> 14:43.963
So...

14:44.120 --> 14:46.282
So, uh, we...

14:46.440 --> 14:48.681
...are leaving.

14:51.880 --> 14:54.326
Wait a second,
I don't even know your name.

14:55.880 --> 14:58.406
Are you taking the fire escape?

15:05.280 --> 15:07.362
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.764
Hey. Black,
or cream and sugar?

15:16.920 --> 15:19.366
- You stalking me now?
- I just want to know your name.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.882
Why? So you can poke me,
friend me, ask for my number?

15:23.040 --> 15:25.327
Or you could
just give me your number.

15:25.480 --> 15:26.766
You're not
relationship material.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.445
Relationship?
You're looking for a relationship?

15:28.600 --> 15:30.284
I love relationships.
I'm great at relationships.

15:30.480 --> 15:33.404
No. Actually, I'm just trying
to get rid of you nicely.

15:34.280 --> 15:35.884
Didn't we have sex?

15:37.560 --> 15:40.564
I have a thing for bridge-and-tunnel
guys when I drink.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.927
Did you just call me
bridge-and-tunnel?

15:43.960 --> 15:45.325
You took me out
for cheese fries.

15:45.480 --> 15:47.801
Cheese fries!

15:47.960 --> 15:49.166
Oh. Then what?

15:49.320 --> 15:51.641
Then you had the night of your life.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.251
Your words, not mine.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.926
Oh... Black.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.971
Adam Cassidy?
My name is Miles Meachum.

16:34.240 --> 16:36.083
Mr. Wyatt would like to speak with you.

16:39.680 --> 16:41.250
How did you know where I was?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.207
I mean, I don't even live around here.

17:02.560 --> 17:04.050
Ah! Mr. Cassidy.

17:05.079 --> 17:08.084
The man who claims he knows
my business better than I do.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.765
Here, take a seat.

17:11.160 --> 17:14.130
- Drop of vino?
- Uh... No.

17:15.200 --> 17:19.204
It seems you were the beneficiary
of an accounting error we made.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.199
I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.009
The Ethion discretionary fund.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.886
Where's my money?

17:28.040 --> 17:30.122
We used it on market research.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.726
At Club Rise?

17:32.880 --> 17:34.370
Sixteen grand?

17:34.520 --> 17:37.683
It must be a very detailed report.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.881
You think you can rip me off
and get away with it?

17:41.080 --> 17:42.411
Credit card fraud?

17:42.640 --> 17:44.642
No, sir, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna pay you back.

17:44.800 --> 17:48.043
No you won't. It wasn't a loan.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.931
Now there's two ways
we can play this.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.481
Are you a horse or a dog?

17:54.640 --> 17:57.769
A horse is motivated by fear.
He's running from the whip.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.922
The whip here being felony fraud.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.686
- He's a dog.
- A dog is motivated by hunger.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.922
He's chasing the rabbit,
his next meal.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.765
You were raised
in a low-income home in Brooklyn.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.127
Your mother died
when you were seven.

18:10.280 --> 18:12.726
Your W-2 says you
now support your father.

18:12.880 --> 18:13.927
So?

18:14.080 --> 18:16.048
So, it means you came
across that bridge every day

18:16.240 --> 18:17.605
hungry to succeed.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.922
- Everyone wants to succeed.
- Yeah, but not like us.

18:20.080 --> 18:23.289
Your father spent 32 years
as a security guard.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.807
- Where's the ambition in that?
- What's this about?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.162
You want more out of life!

18:28.320 --> 18:32.211
I grew up like you.
I mean, different streets.

18:32.360 --> 18:35.807
Same dream,
but nobody gave it to me. No one.

18:35.960 --> 18:39.203
And what if I told you
I could make you rich?

18:39.360 --> 18:41.169
And give your friends their jobs back?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.082
That was a smart pitch
you gave yesterday.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.410
I started out at Eikon.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.327
Jock Goddard was my mentor.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.209
Do you know him?

19:00.360 --> 19:02.169
Yeah, of course I know him.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.527
I did my graduate thesis
on semi-conductor memory.

19:04.680 --> 19:08.002
Goddard's basically the reason
cell phones aren't the size of bricks.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.127
He founded Eikon.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.169
And built it
into the largest publicly traded

19:11.320 --> 19:12.890
technology company in the world.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.690
And ever since I left,
he has spent

19:14.880 --> 19:17.008
every waking moment
trying to destroy me.

19:17.160 --> 19:20.960
Eikon has a new smartphone coming
that's said to be a game-changer.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.770
They're calling it Occura.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.446
You are going to work for Eikon.

19:25.640 --> 19:28.120
- What?
- Get us in the door, you get 500K.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.851
Get us what we need, you'll see
another million in stock options.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.001
Money like that

19:32.160 --> 19:34.003
would allow you to take care
of your father and a whole lot more.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.242
Eikon's not just going to hire me.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.920
They will when
we're done with you.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.689
This is illegal.
It's stealing trade secrets.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.889
This is the opportunity
you have been waiting for.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.401
Now, you could have done a lot of things
with that credit card last night.

19:49.560 --> 19:53.929
Your father's health insurance premium,
graduate school loans,

19:54.080 --> 19:58.165
but you decided to take your mates
out on the town, living it large.

19:58.320 --> 20:01.164
Because you want to know
how the other half lives.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.210
We are the other half!

20:05.680 --> 20:07.762
That's what I'm offering you.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.041
If I say no?

20:10.200 --> 20:14.046
You and your friends will be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.

20:15.280 --> 20:19.524
And you don't want to sit around
and watch me make tea, do you?

20:50.200 --> 20:52.328
What are you, the TV police?

20:52.520 --> 20:55.126
- You were asleep.
- My eyes were closed.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.089
Where you going?

20:57.240 --> 21:00.528
- I caught a break at the company.
- A break, what kind of break?

21:00.680 --> 21:03.604
A kind of break that pays our rent
and keeps your pretty nurse around.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.489
It's a training thing,
so I'll be gone all weekend.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.599
It's Friday night. I thought we were
going to Benzio's for pizza and beer.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.649
I got to work, Dad. That's how you
climb the ladder in this business.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.768
You work harder than the guy below you.

21:13.960 --> 21:16.280
Otherwise you get stuck
doing the same job your whole life.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.448
Look...

21:26.720 --> 21:28.802
Here's some money.
You can order in, OK?

21:28.960 --> 21:31.247
No, no. Thanks.

21:32.680 --> 21:33.886
All right.

21:57.480 --> 22:00.484
What exactly do you do
for the company, Judith?

22:01.560 --> 22:04.166
I have a PhD
in behavioral psychology.

22:04.320 --> 22:07.164
I can take one look at you and tell you
why you haven't succeeded.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.163
Why don't you tell me
how you really feel?

22:09.320 --> 22:10.845
I can give you the tools to ascend

22:11.000 --> 22:13.321
to the highest ranks
of corporate America.

22:13.480 --> 22:15.289
But you have to lose the attitude.

22:56.520 --> 22:57.760
This way.

22:59.440 --> 23:02.046
I'll show you to your room.

23:32.320 --> 23:36.609
When we meet someone, an immediate
cognitive process takes place.

23:36.760 --> 23:39.843
We construct our first ideas on them
based on their appearance.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.210
So, if you want to be accepted,
you have to look the part.

23:45.160 --> 23:48.004
You have to fit in to get in.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.288
What happened with Wyatt and Goddard?

23:50.440 --> 23:51.680
Jack's a brilliant businessman.

23:51.840 --> 23:56.004
He was always able to imbue his products
with a magic of big ideas,

23:56.200 --> 23:57.770
but Wyatt was the brains.

23:57.920 --> 24:00.207
Without his designs,
none of it would have been possible.

24:00.360 --> 24:02.283
Hmm. Sounds like a perfect pairing.

24:02.440 --> 24:06.411
For Goddard, yes. Wyatt gave him
the best years of his life.

24:09.440 --> 24:12.284
Jock lost his son Dylan
to a drug overdose.

24:12.440 --> 24:15.046
So, if you talk
about losing your mother...

24:15.200 --> 24:17.806
No, I won't.

24:17.960 --> 24:21.726
Then, appeal to his void.
Say you had no father figure.

24:21.880 --> 24:23.291
I have a father.

24:23.480 --> 24:25.448
You don't aspire to be like him.

24:38.920 --> 24:40.445
<i>Which brings us to trust.</i>

24:41.400 --> 24:44.404
<i>If you can convince him
that you're just like him,</i>

24:44.560 --> 24:47.370
<i>that you share the same beliefs as him,</i>

24:47.520 --> 24:48.931
<i>it will engender trust.</i>

24:50.560 --> 24:54.246
<i>And trust is
the holy grail of espionage.</i>

24:55.480 --> 24:58.370
She makes it sound so easy.

24:58.520 --> 25:01.763
But this is a man who recognized me
for who I was years before I did.

25:03.240 --> 25:06.164
He kept me close because that's
what you do with an enemy.

25:06.320 --> 25:09.688
When I got restless, he promised me
partnership. It was genius.

25:09.840 --> 25:13.367
I saw the finish line
and I gave him every good idea I ha...

25:13.520 --> 25:17.366
- Who's this?
- He's the new tailor.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.488
I'm George Gardelo, sir.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.726
Would you excuse us, George?

25:21.880 --> 25:23.484
- Yes. Of course.
- Just for a second.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.209
What's going on?

25:31.520 --> 25:32.965
<i>That's how it happens.</i>

25:33.120 --> 25:36.966
A little guy with a needle and thread
brings down an empire.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.363
You really believe that?

25:39.520 --> 25:42.922
Look, it doesn't matter. If you let
no one in, you get burned by no one.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.408
You know what Picasso said?

25:51.560 --> 25:56.566
"A good artist copies.
A great artist steals."

25:56.720 --> 25:58.404
There's nothing original left
in the world, Adam.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.688
We're all stealing
from someone.

26:00.840 --> 26:03.491
You might want
to remember that.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.202
If I lose one
percent market share,

26:10.360 --> 26:13.091
one percent, and I'm ruined.

26:13.240 --> 26:14.401
There is the Dutch deal,

26:14.560 --> 26:17.211
but they're offering half
of what Eikon's willing to pay you.

26:17.360 --> 26:19.044
No, no, I don't care.

26:19.200 --> 26:22.886
I would rather counter
the Dutch for a fraction

26:23.040 --> 26:24.769
than sell to Goddard.

26:24.920 --> 26:27.321
Anything's better than Eikon.

26:28.360 --> 26:29.771
I know.

26:49.600 --> 26:50.726
Hello?

27:20.600 --> 27:23.444
When are you going to find
my friends jobs?

27:23.600 --> 27:26.206
As soon as you get me what I need.

27:32.640 --> 27:35.610
You only have one shot at this.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.442
Mate.

27:45.880 --> 27:49.089
<i>Tom Lungren is
executive hiring coordinator for Eikon.</i>

27:50.400 --> 27:52.767
<i>Your objective here is to connect.</i>

27:56.000 --> 27:57.331
Adam?

27:57.480 --> 27:59.323
- Tom.
- Tom Lungren.

27:59.480 --> 28:02.131
Nice to meet you.
Let me introduce Emma Jennings,

28:02.320 --> 28:04.288
head of our marketing department.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.362
Nice to meet you, Emma.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.851
Please, sit down.

28:13.280 --> 28:15.487
Well, let me start off
by saying that we're

28:15.640 --> 28:18.610
huge fans of the work you did
on Ethion 3.0.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.529
Well, you know,
it hasn't been released yet, so.

28:20.680 --> 28:23.365
Is that because power management
doesn't deliver?

28:23.520 --> 28:25.363
No, the power management is fine.

28:25.520 --> 28:27.090
That's not what we've heard.

28:27.240 --> 28:28.685
We're tweaking
the networking module to make

28:28.840 --> 28:30.205
download speed
the fastest on the market.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.681
Oh, God. I hope that's not why
we agreed to meet with him.

28:34.920 --> 28:36.490
Can you talk specs?

28:36.640 --> 28:39.564
The Orion was an LTE Advanced
with max speeds of 44.2 mbps.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.563
Our new platform is
a WAVE OS 7.5...

28:41.720 --> 28:44.371
Which probably won't solve
the biggest issues you had with 7.0.

28:44.520 --> 28:47.524
- It outsold your model two to one.
- Yeah, the marketing was genius.

28:47.680 --> 28:49.648
I spearheaded that campaign.

28:49.800 --> 28:52.451
Then you know
you're good at hiding flaws.

28:54.120 --> 28:55.565
Have you two met?

28:55.720 --> 28:57.245
No.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.210
No.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.681
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

29:09.640 --> 29:11.919
Always do your homework.
That's what you said, isn't it?

29:11.920 --> 29:13.365
Next time
follow your own advice.

29:13.560 --> 29:16.166
- It wasn't Tom Lungren?
- It wasn't just Tom Lungren.

29:16.320 --> 29:17.845
I told you he might bring
someone else.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.206
Someone that I knew?

29:20.760 --> 29:22.603
What happened?

29:22.760 --> 29:26.606
I saved the day. Connected.
Pulled an offer, a big-ass offer.

29:26.760 --> 29:29.809
Let's take
you to your new apartment.

29:29.960 --> 29:32.611
- What apartment?
- You'll see.

29:43.880 --> 29:46.008
Whoa.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.730
Thought you'd like it.

29:51.800 --> 29:53.643
This is mine?

29:53.800 --> 29:56.167
Of course.

29:56.320 --> 29:59.244
Eikon's newest executive
needs to look the part.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.962
It's nice to see you again, Adam.

30:13.160 --> 30:17.210
Per our agreement, we've deposited
$500,000 into an escrow account.

30:17.360 --> 30:20.648
We're hearing Goddard could
debut Aurora in the next two months,

30:20.800 --> 30:23.644
so I've downloaded background files
on all your co-workers.

30:23.840 --> 30:26.844
First, Emma Jennings.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.809
Father, George Jennings, was

30:28.960 --> 30:31.611
Chief of Surgery
at New York Presbyterian.

30:31.760 --> 30:33.489
She grew up with four brothers,

30:33.680 --> 30:37.127
was always on the outside
of the boys club, looking in.

30:37.280 --> 30:40.204
Desperately wants to succeed
in a man's world,

30:40.400 --> 30:42.721
so she's always the most prepared
person in the room.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.042
Would have been useful
a couple of hours ago.

30:45.200 --> 30:48.249
Don't waste your time.
She has certain standards.

30:50.840 --> 30:53.605
Judith, maybe you're not as smart
as you think you are.

30:53.760 --> 30:56.809
Now don't always say
what you think, darling.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.403
Because from here on out,
you are all the way under.

31:04.480 --> 31:07.450
We'll be communicating
through this phone only.

31:07.960 --> 31:11.681
You will respond to my calls,
no matter the time, day or night.

31:11.840 --> 31:14.002
You got it.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.444
Good morning, sir.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.887
I want a copy of his
body scan sent to my office.

32:09.040 --> 32:10.087
Yes, sir.

32:14.320 --> 32:17.085
- Adam.
- Mr. Lungren.

32:17.240 --> 32:20.005
I told you. You gotta stop calling me
that, you're gonna make me feel old.

32:20.160 --> 32:22.447
- Welcome to Eikon.
- Thank you. It's great to be here.

32:22.600 --> 32:25.171
- We're damn glad to have you.
- OK, good.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.766
The lower floors are Legal, HR,

32:27.960 --> 32:30.804
middle floors are all the other
departments, including marketing.

32:30.960 --> 32:33.804
The 38th floor is R&D,
top security projects.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.201
And we're here on the 40th.

32:36.360 --> 32:39.160
There's just a few tricks to being
in this building and getting around.

32:39.400 --> 32:43.610
Your thumbprint on a keycard app
generates a bar code

32:43.760 --> 32:47.924
that gets you anywhere
your clearance is allowed.

32:48.080 --> 32:49.809
All right.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.850
<i>So any words of wisdom
on Goddard?</i>

32:53.000 --> 32:54.923
<i>Be brilliant and be genuine.</i>

32:55.080 --> 32:58.448
He can spot a fraud a mile away.
Here's your office.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.162
So, Type X was meant
for social networking,

33:09.320 --> 33:11.482
but it turns out that people don't
always want their friends

33:11.640 --> 33:13.210
to know where they are so precisely.

33:13.360 --> 33:15.727
Right. What's the system tech?

33:15.880 --> 33:19.601
It's 3DPS, which is like GPS
plus precise triangulation.

33:19.760 --> 33:20.966
I'm familiar with it.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.527
Problem is, it's twice as heavy
with three times the battery drain.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.361
So, you're handing me a dead fish.

33:29.480 --> 33:33.166
You've got 72 hours
before you present to Goddard.

33:33.360 --> 33:35.328
Thank you.

33:36.120 --> 33:38.646
It's a real-time tracking device
that needs a new purpose.

33:38.800 --> 33:41.167
It's all about the presentation.
You have to impress him.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.926
Yes, I understand what I have to do.

33:45.960 --> 33:49.009
I'll schedule a brainstorming session
with our best R&D guys.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.088
Why do you do this work, Judith?

33:55.040 --> 33:57.805
I mean, is it out of loyalty,
or is it just money?

33:59.360 --> 34:01.010
Don't you have enough
to think about?

34:01.160 --> 34:02.844
Rowena,
I need you to put together

34:03.000 --> 34:04.604
an R&D focus group.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.528
I don't care, wake them up.

34:07.680 --> 34:10.889
Call me when everything's
in place. Bye.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.007
Soldiers.

34:16.639 --> 34:19.210
Soldiers need to know
where each other are at all times.

34:19.360 --> 34:22.125
- They have GPS.
- Yeah.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.567
GPS is great for navigation,
but it doesn't work indoors.

34:24.719 --> 34:26.563
Can't tell if you're
on the first floor or the ninth,

34:26.719 --> 34:28.210
so it's useless in urban warfare.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.681
But with 3DPS,

34:30.880 --> 34:34.601
if I can Trojan-horse tracking data
in an e-mail to each of them...

34:36.080 --> 34:38.286
...I could make this thing work.

34:39.840 --> 34:43.049
- Who are you calling?
- My own R&D focus group.

34:46.719 --> 34:49.563
Yo, Kev, it's me. I need your help.

34:53.440 --> 34:56.091
I got recruited by one of those...

34:57.080 --> 34:58.320
...headhunters.

34:58.480 --> 35:03.042
Long story short,
I work for Eikon now.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.926
I heard they weren't hiring.

35:07.120 --> 35:09.964
I got lucky, I guess.

35:10.120 --> 35:11.804
I guess.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.367
Well, hey, I've been working
on what we talked about,

35:16.520 --> 35:19.842
and the military thing is
definitely possible.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.403
I just tweaked
the Eikon software a little.

35:25.240 --> 35:27.402
I'm calling it the Boomerang.

35:27.600 --> 35:29.489
Just check this out.

35:32.120 --> 35:35.681
I sent your 3DPS data e-mail to you,
me and Allison.

35:35.840 --> 35:38.764
So now our phones track each other
working in unison.

35:38.920 --> 35:42.208
And you were right, the 3DPS,
that's what makes the difference.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.129
That was a good call, by the way.

35:46.720 --> 35:50.008
Dude, that's awesome.
You crushed this. Good job.

35:50.160 --> 35:52.640
Yeah, but that ain't all.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.124
Pick up Allison.

35:59.240 --> 36:02.005
<i>- What can I get you?</i>
<i>- Another OJ.</i>

36:02.160 --> 36:03.127
<i>One more OJ.</i>

36:03.280 --> 36:05.009
How the hell did you do that?

36:05.160 --> 36:06.840
<i>Who orders orange juice in a bar?</i>

36:06.960 --> 36:09.247
<i>Someone who wants to keep
his edge.</i>

36:09.400 --> 36:11.323
<i>- What's your name?
- Allison.</i>

36:13.520 --> 36:14.931
Do you know that guy?

36:15.160 --> 36:17.640
Hey, OJ!

36:17.800 --> 36:19.290
We're sleeping together, me and her.

36:22.040 --> 36:24.168
Nice to meet you, Allison.

36:25.160 --> 36:28.960
All I do is sit around here,
watching her get hit on all the time.

36:29.160 --> 36:30.286
It's exhausting!

36:30.440 --> 36:32.363
I need a job.

37:12.240 --> 37:14.447
Good morning, Caroline.
Excuse me.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.887
- Jock Goddard.
- Adam Cassidy.

37:17.040 --> 37:20.089
Of course you are. Everything all right?
Settling in OK?

37:20.240 --> 37:22.083
- Yeah. Thank you.
- How's your office?

37:22.240 --> 37:25.210
- Oh, yeah, it's beautiful. Thank you.
- Good. Let's get started.

37:27.320 --> 37:30.085
Well, sir, I'm afraid
you've wasted a lot of money

37:30.240 --> 37:33.210
developing Type X
as a social networking device.

37:34.280 --> 37:37.250
But the military applications
of this device are undeniable.

37:37.440 --> 37:39.124
I sent you all an e-mail this morning

37:39.280 --> 37:42.682
in which I encoded 3DPS-like data
to identify you.

37:42.840 --> 37:46.242
Everyone I sent an e-mail to is
in this room. Except for one.

37:48.800 --> 37:52.122
Death by friendly fire remains
a sad reality of war.

37:52.280 --> 37:55.568
3DPS is more precise than GPS
and works on a Z-axis.

37:55.720 --> 37:58.485
While the product was deemed
too heavy for civilians,

37:58.640 --> 38:01.849
an added 12 ounces is
nothing to a soldier.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.685
So this is all so you can see
what floor our phones are on?

38:04.880 --> 38:07.247
Yes. 'Cause in the heat of battle
that can be the difference

38:07.400 --> 38:10.165
between killing the enemy or...

38:14.040 --> 38:15.530
...killing your own.

38:19.280 --> 38:22.090
Type X just saved her life.

38:23.600 --> 38:24.601
Good morning.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.524
Good morning, sorry.

38:28.320 --> 38:29.242
Morning.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.971
How long have you had with this?

38:32.160 --> 38:33.446
Seventy-two hours, sir.

38:36.040 --> 38:38.122
Let's put together a team for Adam.

38:38.280 --> 38:41.170
Design, engineering. Let's see
if we can get some DOD funding.

38:41.320 --> 38:44.483
Issues? No? Good.

38:44.640 --> 38:46.290
Good.

38:48.320 --> 38:50.288
Nice work.

38:53.320 --> 38:55.288
I thought that went pretty well.

38:55.440 --> 38:58.171
Beginner's luck.

38:58.320 --> 39:02.723
- You are hard to please.
- Not that you'd remember.

39:02.880 --> 39:05.167
Let me take you
to dinner this weekend.

39:05.360 --> 39:07.249
I have to be
in the Hamptons this weekend.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.641
Oh, good. I'll come with you.

39:12.360 --> 39:15.091
It wasn't an invitation.

39:23.520 --> 39:26.205
<i>Hi, Adam. I'm calling
from Jock Goddard's office.</i>

39:26.360 --> 39:28.806
<i>Jock is having a few people over
to his house in the Hamptons</i>

39:28.960 --> 39:31.361
<i>on Saturday
and he'd like you to join him.</i>

39:38.160 --> 39:40.208
So now we go
for military funding.

39:40.360 --> 39:43.284
Dude, that's great.
Congratulations, man.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.367
Hey, so, I got a favor to ask.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.562
I got an interview at Eikon next week.

39:53.040 --> 39:56.408
And I know I'm gonna be
another resume in a stack

39:56.560 --> 39:58.722
if I don't build some traction.

40:00.400 --> 40:02.368
Right.

40:03.680 --> 40:06.809
So, I feel awkward
even asking you this, but...

40:06.960 --> 40:08.644
Hey, of course.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.729
All right,
I'll speak to HR on Monday.

40:11.720 --> 40:13.370
All right.

40:13.960 --> 40:15.200
Thanks.

41:09.160 --> 41:10.321
Nicest guy.

41:10.480 --> 41:14.087
Right through the red light
and hit the back of the car.

41:14.280 --> 41:16.328
- Very apologetic.
- Somebody looks lost.

41:16.480 --> 41:17.402
Oh, hey!

41:17.560 --> 41:19.289
- Hi.
- Hey.

41:19.440 --> 41:21.329
- There he is.
- I'm glad you could make it.

41:21.480 --> 41:24.324
- Thanks for having me, Mr. Goddard.
- Jock.

41:24.480 --> 41:26.130
- You know Tom, of course.
- Hey.

41:26.280 --> 41:30.285
Jock tells me my stock's gone up
in value since your Type X pitch.

41:30.440 --> 41:33.489
First time up at bat and you bang it
off the scoreboard? Way to go.

41:33.640 --> 41:36.086
And this is Emma.
She's spearheading the marketing

41:36.240 --> 41:38.720
on our new smartphone, Occura.

41:38.880 --> 41:40.325
Nice suit.

41:40.480 --> 41:44.565
Watch our for her. She's one
of those Ivy Leaguers. Princeton.

41:44.720 --> 41:46.324
Yale, actually.

41:46.520 --> 41:48.329
Where her brothers went.

41:48.520 --> 41:51.126
How did you know
I went to Yale?

41:51.320 --> 41:53.891
It was on Facebook
or something.

41:54.040 --> 41:56.008
Ah.

41:56.200 --> 41:58.328
So much for privacy.

41:58.480 --> 42:02.371
Privacy.
Absolute myth, no such thing.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.602
- Tom, you want a drink?
- Yeah, absolutely.

42:07.720 --> 42:09.051
A glass of wine, sir?

42:09.200 --> 42:11.089
- White wine.
- Mineral water, cold.

42:12.520 --> 42:14.124
See you later.

42:16.640 --> 42:19.246
Kind of like a Bordeaux,
more dry.

43:30.360 --> 43:32.966
If you're looking
for the bathroom, you missed it.

43:34.720 --> 43:37.087
Yeah, sorry, I, uh...

43:37.320 --> 43:39.448
I saw the radio. Does it work?

43:39.600 --> 43:43.207
Yeah, they work.
They all work. I built them.

43:43.360 --> 43:46.887
That's how I spent
my teens. Ham radio.

43:47.040 --> 43:48.610
Where'd you grow up?

43:49.680 --> 43:52.889
Town of Hamilton, 3500 people.

43:53.040 --> 43:55.202
Where is that?

43:56.640 --> 43:58.165
It doesn't matter.

44:03.080 --> 44:07.483
You remind me of Wyatt.
I'm surprised he let you go.

44:07.640 --> 44:09.483
He wasn't too happy about it.

44:09.640 --> 44:12.962
I knew he'd be
my competition someday.

44:13.120 --> 44:15.088
I knew it before he did.

44:15.240 --> 44:16.924
Why'd you take him
under your wing?

44:17.080 --> 44:19.481
It's not about him.
It's about putting products out there

44:19.640 --> 44:21.768
to make people's lives better.

44:21.920 --> 44:23.968
Competition fuels innovation.

44:24.120 --> 44:26.487
Without it,
Eikon wouldn't be where it is today.

44:26.680 --> 44:28.489
And where is that?

44:29.680 --> 44:32.650
On the eve of a revolution.

44:38.080 --> 44:39.889
Is that your son?

44:41.160 --> 44:43.640
Yeah, that's Dylan.

44:44.680 --> 44:46.682
You have a bit of success,
you begin to think

44:46.840 --> 44:51.209
that you've got some control
over things, but...

44:52.240 --> 44:55.528
...shit happens to everybody.

44:55.680 --> 44:58.251
Yeah.

45:03.360 --> 45:05.647
I lost my mother when I was seven.

45:08.520 --> 45:10.648
Do you remember her?

45:12.160 --> 45:13.924
Not much.

45:15.080 --> 45:17.560
I feel like I lose her
a little more every day.

45:17.720 --> 45:19.245
Yeah.

45:20.840 --> 45:22.569
Couple nights after Dilly died,

45:22.720 --> 45:25.690
I woke up in the middle of the night
in a panic.

45:26.720 --> 45:29.166
Rummaged through the whole house,
his whole room...

45:30.560 --> 45:32.688
...looking for anything.

45:34.720 --> 45:37.690
Kid's drawings, schoolwork...

45:39.200 --> 45:40.929
...old pair of tennis shoes.

45:41.080 --> 45:45.051
Anything that would keep him alive.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.765
The front hall, under the stairs.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.325
Sir?

45:58.560 --> 46:00.767
The bathroom.

46:02.640 --> 46:04.165
Thanks.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.049
You know,
the suit's not all that bad.

46:20.200 --> 46:22.601
You don't have to hide way out here.

46:22.800 --> 46:25.883
I was, uh, playing hard to get.

46:26.040 --> 46:28.691
But you're already gotten.

46:30.640 --> 46:32.927
So tell me,

46:33.080 --> 46:34.684
how is it that you know
so much about me

46:34.840 --> 46:37.764
and I know nothing about you?

46:41.560 --> 46:44.609
It's this, uh, little row home
my grandmother owned.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.808
Five of us sharing one bathroom.

46:46.960 --> 46:49.531
My dad was a security guard.

46:49.680 --> 46:52.650
Now he has emphysema,
but still smokes.

46:52.800 --> 46:55.610
And I'm pretty sure he's putting it
to the nurse I'm paying for.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.367
When I think of losing him...

47:05.360 --> 47:07.124
Aah...

47:07.280 --> 47:08.645
What about you?

47:11.560 --> 47:13.847
I come from a family where...

47:14.840 --> 47:17.844
...the expectation is so high
that I can't really ever succeed.

47:19.880 --> 47:23.248
It's fine,
it's just that I keep trying.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.010
So...

47:34.000 --> 47:36.810
I'm trying to sleep
my way to the top.

47:38.720 --> 47:40.802
Are we covered?

47:44.200 --> 47:47.443
Come on. Take me home?

47:47.600 --> 47:49.568
Yeah.

51:04.280 --> 51:05.805
Dad?

51:07.880 --> 51:10.326
You got a visitor.

51:16.760 --> 51:18.364
Who are you?

51:18.520 --> 51:22.206
You might want to remove the battery
from your cellular device.

51:23.080 --> 51:25.321
What?

51:25.480 --> 51:28.086
You think 'cause you're not on a call,
they can't hear you?

51:29.920 --> 51:31.490
Agent Gamble.

51:32.960 --> 51:35.247
I'm with the FBI's
Criminal Investigation Division.

51:41.080 --> 51:44.163
We've been looking at the Wyatt Corp
for about five years now.

51:45.120 --> 51:47.566
- I don't work for Wyatt.
- John Moore did.

51:48.720 --> 51:51.121
He was in Wyatt's training program
in '09.

51:53.080 --> 51:57.961
Stella Ross, migrated
from Wyatt to Eikon like you.

51:58.120 --> 52:02.091
Two months later,
her steering column exploded.

52:03.280 --> 52:05.203
And Richard McAllister...

52:06.120 --> 52:09.010
...whose Ethion work you drafted off of.

52:15.280 --> 52:16.964
I didn't draft off his work.

52:17.120 --> 52:19.119
A month ago,
you were circling the drain at Wyatt.

52:19.120 --> 52:22.841
Now you're some hotshot exec
over at Eikon? Don't bullshit me.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.968
OK, I think it's time for you to go.

52:25.160 --> 52:27.288
You think Wyatt's gonna fill
your pockets and let you walk?

52:27.440 --> 52:29.159
I don't know what
you're talking about, OK?

52:29.160 --> 52:31.561
Come on, Adam.

52:31.720 --> 52:33.722
How long do you think
you can keep this up?

52:35.640 --> 52:38.610
All it takes is one mistake,
one slip up.

52:42.840 --> 52:44.126
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

52:47.920 --> 52:51.003
Just don't wait till it's too late.

53:17.400 --> 53:20.404
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

53:23.920 --> 53:25.285
You wouldn't understand.

53:26.520 --> 53:28.807
Yeah, I was probably too busy

53:28.960 --> 53:31.691
putting three meals
in front of you every day

53:31.840 --> 53:34.650
and giving you all the love
that parents had.

53:35.640 --> 53:39.122
Come on, Adam.
We had a perfect life.

53:39.320 --> 53:42.085
You know, if your insurance covered
even half of what morn needed...

53:42.280 --> 53:44.601
Don't try to revise death.
What did you want me to do?

53:44.760 --> 53:46.728
I wanted you to fight.

53:46.880 --> 53:49.121
I wanted us to have enough
to at least give her a chance.

53:49.240 --> 53:51.049
You gotta give that up.

53:52.280 --> 53:55.250
These companies steal so much,
there's nothing left to earn.

53:55.400 --> 53:57.880
Yeah, what you're doing
doesn't make it right.

53:58.040 --> 54:00.088
No.

54:00.240 --> 54:02.447
No one can make it right.

54:02.600 --> 54:05.763
So, why shouldn't
I get my share? Huh?

54:07.440 --> 54:10.922
The FBI just walked out of our house.

54:11.080 --> 54:13.367
I don't want to end up like you.

54:54.920 --> 54:56.809
So that's what he's up to.

54:58.520 --> 55:00.204
That's what you wanted.

55:01.360 --> 55:03.328
I'm done now. This isn't who I am.

55:03.480 --> 55:07.280
This is exactly who you are.
Did you frisk him?

55:10.280 --> 55:12.123
You hiding something?

55:14.320 --> 55:15.924
Knock it off!

55:16.120 --> 55:18.691
You've been a little temperamental
lately, haven't you?

55:18.840 --> 55:20.251
Are you falling for that girl?

55:20.400 --> 55:23.643
- He's falling for Jock.
- All right, all right!

55:26.800 --> 55:28.245
What'd he talk about?

55:28.400 --> 55:31.802
He talked about progress,
enriching people's lives.

55:31.960 --> 55:34.122
Yeah, he talk about his son?

55:34.280 --> 55:36.203
Yeah. A little.

55:36.960 --> 55:38.928
It seem rehearsed?

55:39.080 --> 55:40.161
No.

55:40.320 --> 55:43.403
It did the first time he told it.

55:43.560 --> 55:45.881
That was when the world fell in love
with Jock Goddard,

55:46.040 --> 55:48.168
the grieving father.

55:48.360 --> 55:53.571
That story of his little dead boy
saved Eikon.

55:53.720 --> 55:55.609
I got what you asked for, OK?

55:55.760 --> 55:57.205
We had a deal.
I just want my money.

55:57.360 --> 55:59.328
Oh, he wants his money.

55:59.480 --> 56:02.404
We'll keep your money for you.
You'll be doing five to ten upstate.

56:02.560 --> 56:04.324
I got the specs. That was the deal.

56:04.480 --> 56:06.608
Pictures are no good to me.

56:06.800 --> 56:09.770
I need to know what it does, I need
to hold it in my hand and see it run!

56:09.920 --> 56:12.207
Do you understand me?
Put it in my fucking hand!

56:12.360 --> 56:14.362
Or what? I end up like Richard?

56:24.040 --> 56:26.611
Jock builds one prototype.

56:27.520 --> 56:32.242
It's assembled in the vault,
piece by piece, until beta trials.

56:32.400 --> 56:34.482
It stays in the vault
on the 38th floor.

56:34.640 --> 56:37.246
Without files, without source code,
you can't do...

56:37.400 --> 56:39.880
No, I don't need his files.

56:40.920 --> 56:42.649
I just need to see his vision.

56:42.800 --> 56:47.283
No, I'm not doing this anymore. I'm out.

56:50.320 --> 56:54.245
You're out?
You are only out, my son,

56:54.400 --> 56:57.244
when I say you're out!

56:57.400 --> 56:59.448
I own you right now.

56:59.640 --> 57:03.281
You see?
I can get to anyone.

57:06.280 --> 57:09.170
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

57:10.440 --> 57:13.649
It's just business, Adam.
Everybody steals, everybody lies.

57:13.800 --> 57:16.007
There's no right or wrong.

57:16.200 --> 57:17.964
There's just winning or losing.

57:25.160 --> 57:30.087
<i>Now the first order of business
is lifting Emma's fingerprints.</i>

57:34.160 --> 57:35.571
So my parents
are having this thing

57:35.760 --> 57:38.525
for my brother's engagement
this weekend.

57:38.720 --> 57:41.087
You wanna go with me?

57:43.800 --> 57:45.484
To meet your parents?

57:45.640 --> 57:47.449
It's just dinner and drinks.

57:49.600 --> 57:51.329
You, uh...

57:53.640 --> 57:56.962
You sure I'm relationship material?

57:59.440 --> 58:02.649
You know what? It's...
It's actually gonna be really boring.

58:02.800 --> 58:05.451
- Probably better if you don't.
- Hey.

58:08.040 --> 58:10.168
Of course I will.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.288
Even if it is boring?

58:15.480 --> 58:17.801
Yeah, even if it's boring.

58:40.520 --> 58:41.965
Hey, what happened to you?

58:42.160 --> 58:44.288
Kev! What are you doing here?

58:44.440 --> 58:46.363
What do you think
I'm doing here?

58:47.520 --> 58:49.329
Your interview. Right.

58:49.480 --> 58:51.005
Uh...

58:51.880 --> 58:55.123
- How'd it go? I spoke to HR.
- No, you didn't.

58:56.120 --> 58:57.485
I'm sorry, man. I, uh...

58:58.520 --> 59:00.363
I've been under a ton of pressure.
I completely forgot...

59:00.520 --> 59:03.729
Yeah, I understand, man. Your new
apartment, new car, new girlfriend.

59:03.880 --> 59:05.400
You have no idea
what I'm dealing with.

59:05.560 --> 59:08.530
No, I don't.
And I don't think I ever will.

59:08.680 --> 59:10.887
- Thanks.
- Come on, Kev. I'm sorry, man.

59:11.040 --> 59:12.201
Kev!

59:12.400 --> 59:14.243
Mr. Goddard wants to see you.

59:16.760 --> 59:19.525
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I understand that.

59:20.560 --> 59:23.643
Wyatt has to consider our offer.
He has no choice.

59:23.800 --> 59:26.451
I mean, he's tap dancing
on the Titanic.

59:26.600 --> 59:29.080
Come on in.

59:29.240 --> 59:30.526
Look, somebody just walked in.

59:30.680 --> 59:32.409
I've got something
I've got to deal with.

59:32.560 --> 59:34.449
All right. Thanks.

59:36.240 --> 59:39.005
Don't forget, you have
a lunch reservation at the club.

59:39.560 --> 59:42.450
Come on. Let's take a drive.
I'll buy you lunch.

59:42.640 --> 59:46.406
Got some interesting news
this morning concerning you.

59:46.600 --> 59:50.571
Thought I'd make sure it was true
before I talk to you about it.

59:51.600 --> 59:55.127
- Is everything all right?
- You tell me.

59:55.320 --> 59:59.928
The DOD has given us
preliminary funding for Type X.

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:12.444
- We'll leave it here, Mr. Goddard.
- Thanks, Bud.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.444
- Well, what do you think?
- It's powerful.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.001
Yeah, it is.

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.447
Consider it a loaner
for saving Type X.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.444
- Jock, I couldn't.
- Yeah, you could.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:27.008
Power is the juice,
get used to drinking it.

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.009
I heard you talking
about Occura.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.605
There's a lot of buzz about it.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:34.730
Yeah, Occura's been,
uh, gestating

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:38.805
for... quite a few years.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.486
We only recently were able to put

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:44.166
all of the elements together
to make it happen.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:45.890
- I'll have coffee.
- I'll have a water.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.121
Very good.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:50.489
Imagine walking around
with nothing but your cell phone.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.961
No wallet, no keys.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:54.929
Like a digital wallet.

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.367
It'll be your driver's license,
it'll be your credit card,

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.487
it'll be more than that.

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.645
Super slim. Foldable, with a battery
that recharges itself

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.491
from any ambient electrical source.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.650
It'll know where you've been,
who you've been with.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.691
It'll track your priorities,
expenditures,

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:15.844
your health, calendar.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.925
It will know who you are.
And it's all ours.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:22.481
You think people really want
all that personal information

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.801
under one roof?

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:27.009
It's not the roof that matters, Adam.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.444
It's the warm fuzzy feeling
of the home under it.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:35.127
People are so distracted these days,
they don't know who they are.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.520
But we will.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.650
We'll know them better
than they know themselves.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.528
Oh, my goodness.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.607
Jock.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.250
Nick.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.010
How long has it been?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.923
Not long enough.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.686
You look like
you're holding up all right.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:07.083
Oh, I'm doing fine.
What brings you here?

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.681
Lunch. Lunch brings me here.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.563
- You remember Judith.
- Oh, of course.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.643
- How are you, Judith?
- Good.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.565
You remember Adam Cassidy.
He designed your Ethion.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.927
Yes, he did.

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:22.683
Hello, again, Adam.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.569
He reminds me of you.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.206
Way back when,
before you walked out on us.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.725
Let's not muddle the facts.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.644
You asked me to walk
and locked the door behind me.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:35.531
Besides, I was smarter than Adam here.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.682
And I didn't spend all my time
kissing your ass.

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:44.609
How is Ethion? We've heard
remarkably little about it.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.923
Mm. Ethion's fine.
How's Occura?

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.003
Right on schedule.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.851
And it's something you're
never going to be able to duplicate.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.729
Is that so?

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.209
Remember when we used
to share ideas, Nick?

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:00.600
I try not to.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:04.606
When we put our heads together,
there was no problem we couldn't solve.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.404
Nothing we couldn't make.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.608
There was no problem I couldn't solve.

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.643
Nothing I couldn't make.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.448
I miss your friendship.

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:17.405
Why don't we sit down together sometime.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.967
Always so full of shit.
You sit here like...

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:26.566
...like some big shot
with boy wonder here,

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.644
blowing smoke up your ass
like it's still relevant.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:32.280
The truth is, I'm gonna bury you,

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.967
and your boy here
is gonna be working for me again.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:40.006
Because working for you,
means he'll be working for me.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.125
Don't let your lunch get cold, Nick.

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.922
Nice seeing you, Judith.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.207
He's running
search after search on Goddard.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.243
What is he looking for?

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.811
I don't know.

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:30.605
I think this
boy's gone soft on us.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.846
<i>Were you going to ignore my call?</i>

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.322
You should have told me
Wyatt was gonna be there.

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.721
<i>Why do you keep pacing so much?
You look nervous.</i>

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.609
<i>You have something you want to tell me?</i>

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.651
Where are you?

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.919
<i>Now let me explain to you
how this is going to work.</i>

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.729
We hit one of your friends first.

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.729
<i>Or maybe the girl.</i>

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.002
If you even touch her...

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.891
Then get us what we need.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.731
<i>You have two days
to break into Eikon.</i>

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.969
<i>This is your last warning.</i>

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:48.207
Help! Help me! Somebody help me!

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:57.005
He said I had two days.
That was the night before last.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.926
These people are everywhere.
Put cameras in your house.

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:06.564
I'm sorry. I just...

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.003
I messed up, Dad.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:14.047
I thought I knew what I was doing.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.321
You have to figure a way out.

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:27.441
Adam.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.087
Adam.

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:33.890
- Adam!
- This is serious, OK?

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.444
You got to figure a way out.

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:42.290
It's not that easy.

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:46.081
OK? I put a lot of people
I care about in danger.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:57.081
Adam, I think
the FBI is the only option.

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.928
I could go to jail.

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.490
Or they could kill you.

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:52.568
<i>There was a black car and it
just came out of nowhere and it hit him.</i>

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.728
Slow down. Is he all right?
Where are you?

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:58.521
<i>I've been trying to reach you all day.
Kev's at the hospital, but he's OK.</i>

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.330
<i>I think they're discharging us now.</i>

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.608
OK, were there witnesses?
Did anyone get the plates?

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:05.770
<i>I don't think so. I don't know, it just
all happened so fast. I got to go.</i>

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:07.922
- OK, call me back.
<i>- I will.</i>

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:48.401
Hey!

01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.969
Hey! What's the matter with you?!

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.248
Go, go, go, Go!

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.525
On your knees.

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.081
- I'll do it, I'll do it!
- Get on your knees!

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:45.962
You're going in tonight, and you'll need
Emma's phone to do it.

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:48.285
Get moving.

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.287
Can I come in?

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.405
I haven't been honest with you.

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.131
What do you mean?

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:20.041
There's things I want to tell you
that I haven't told you.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.845
What is it?

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.406
Mr. Cassidy.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:59.722
- Yeah?
- Working late tonight?

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.044
Burning that midnight oil.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.121
Adam?

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.370
I've lost floors one through five.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.841
We've got security lights
in sector two.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.490
<i>Hold your position.</i>

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.728
Get our IT guy on the line.

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:54.524
Before we move on to sector three,
let's check that server.

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:06.248
I want the list
of everyone in the building.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.041
Control...

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.402
- I'm only showing one exec present.
- Who is it?

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:22.527
Adam Cassidy.

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.046
Oh, come on.

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.167
<i>Hi, it's Emma. Leave a message.</i>

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.841
Marty, go check on Adam Cassidy.

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:49.609
Roger, I'm en route. Come on!

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.763
<i>Adam Cassidy is not in his office.</i>

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:28.126
Shit.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:32.606
All hands on, get this guy!
Use any means necessary.

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:41.841
Clear.

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.606
Mr. Cassidy!

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:18.204
We've got somebody at the vault.

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.491
What the hell?

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:15.521
Jock.

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:18.610
Mr. Cassidy.

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:22.445
Got caught with your hand
in the cookie jar, didn't you?

01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:27.610
I... Jock, I can explain this.

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:29.531
Where you gonna start?

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:33.291
I was beginning to think
it would never happen.

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:38.890
Wyatt would rather watch
his company crumble than sell it to me.

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:43.811
Then you came along
with your blind ambition.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.480
We recorded it all, every conversation,

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.921
every text between you and Wyatt.

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:54.681
You tell Nick he'll be selling me
majority shares in his company

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.730
or evidence of your collusion goes
to the FBI.

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:02.162
You manipulated me.

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.049
Yes.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:09.524
You'll be at the Sutton Club tomorrow
at noon. You, Nick, and me.

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:13.728
Nobody else.
No lawyers, no handlers. Nobody.

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:15.245
Let him out!

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:31.329
Big mistake.

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:35.644
Yeah.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.083
What are you doing here?
You can't be here.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.600
You used me.

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:16.445
I'm sorry. OK? I'm so sorry.

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.320
You got to go,
you're not safe here.

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:21.761
Everything you...
everything you said,

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:26.164
every... everything you did...
was a lie.

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.402
No, that's not true.
Not everything.

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.042
I wanted to be someone else.

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.121
Now you are.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.564
Now you are.

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:49.802
You know...

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:54.764
I fell for you because
you weren't like everyone else.

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:03.443
Emma, I'm gonna make this right.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.962
You don't know what that is.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.890
Well, you sure messed that up.

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.644
Hey, look, I'm trying, OK?

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:38.327
Yeah, well, now you're done trying.
Let's go for a ride.

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.243
Look, you don't get it, OK?
It was all a setup!

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:43.970
- Get in the car!
- It was all a setup!

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:25.485
I'm sorry, man.

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:30.321
What are you sorry for?

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:32.323
You didn't run me over, did you?

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.124
I'm the reason for all of this.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.729
The real question is...

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:47.242
...what are we gonna do about it?

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.322
I'm going to use what they taught me...

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:57.848
...to destroy what they built.

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:11.807
So, what's the news
on the Dutch deal?

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.281
- I don't know.
- Good, we won't need them anyway.

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:21.088
Don't remember inviting you.

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:25.091
My going-away party got
this whole thing rolling.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.964
I thought it was only fair
that I show up for yours.

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:32.729
What are you talking about?

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:35.087
Goddard orchestrated this whole thing...

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.968
...to entrap you
into committing a crime.

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:44.684
I didn't commit a crime.

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.366
You did.

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.083
This is the death of your empire, Nick.

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:53.971
And you were funded
with money I never touched,

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:57.522
by corporations I had never heard of.
He has nothing.

01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:59.523
He has everything.

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:03.890
<i>E-mails, texts.
He got the break-in on camera.</i>

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.411
<i>All the dots connect back to you.
The whole thing was</i> a <i>setup.</i>

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:09.050
What's going on?
What's going on?

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:13.808
- We had good intel on this!
- Where did you get that intel, Nick?

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:26.770
This is absurd.

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:43.850
You can't just...

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:49.081
Hamilton.

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.842
Jack's hometown.

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.006
Nick...

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:14.846
Meachum.

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:31.844
That's one down.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.240
One more to go.

01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:47.808
Whatever you have better be good.

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:50.121
If it works, we both walk away
with an insurance policy

01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:52.123
no amount of money can buy.

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:54.567
Yeah, but if it doesn't?

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:14.246
Get out your phones. Sit down.
Put the batteries on the table.

01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:43.242
It says you've got another phone.

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:11.727
- Oh, no, no.
- What happened?

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:13.325
I lost the signal.
Both phones, they're gone.

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:14.641
Can you get it back?

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:24.687
- You'll pay for this.
- Yeah, I'll pay.

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:30.644
I'm buying every goddamn share
of Wyatt Corporation's stock you own,

01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:33.161
and I'm paying
40 cents on the dollar.

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:36.285
How does that sound?

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:41.722
I get it or the Feds do.

01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:48.201
- You'll never get away with this.
- Shut up, Adam.

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:51.882
You're nothing but a convenient tool,
an empty vessel.

01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:53.479
I filled you with piss and vinegar

01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:57.007
and told you it was champagne
and you lapped it up.

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:01.406
- I'm not signing this.
- Then you'll go to jail.

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:05.684
With what? What have you got?!

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:07.365
Ah...

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.324
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:12.127
What?

01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:14.965
- Sign it!
- You have taken credit for everything.

01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:18.886
And you've created nothing!
You arrogant bastard!

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:22.245
I took a brick device
that everybody laughed at

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:26.246
and turned it into the one thing
that no one can do without.

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:28.169
I earned my arrogance!

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:32.285
Yes, and none of that happens
without me! You stood on my shoulders!

01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:34.568
And now I'm standing on your neck!

01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:38.611
I'm 15 moves ahead of you, Nick.

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:41.286
The Dutch offer, me!

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:46.731
I strung you along
until the only hope was... Adam.

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:52.283
That's impossible.

01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:53.885
Impossible?

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:57.010
I built Wyatt Corp.

01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:00.767
Sell or not, your company is finished.

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:03.969
You've got nothing in the pipe,
and even if you did,

01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:07.488
you've got no money to market it with.

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:11.281
Forty cents on the dollar is
a lot better than jail.

01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:12.845
You make the choice.

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.326
Now get out.

01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:43.403
He likes to eat his young.

01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:47.489
They're mine to eat.

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:09.411
It's time to go back
to your sad little life.

01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:11.531
Why go to all the trouble?

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:15.571
<i>Because I wanted
to see him bleed. Go.</i>

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:18.371
No. There's more to it,
you wouldn't risk it all just for that.

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:22.809
I told you, Adam,
competition breeds innovation.

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:25.361
With his name on the door,
he developed his ass off.

01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:27.369
You needed him.

01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:29.722
You needed his mind
because he was smarter than you.

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:32.526
He made a great processor
and a shitty phone

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:35.524
and he served a purpose,
just like you did. Go.

01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:39.004
You're nothing without him.

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:43.723
Occura is real.
It'll do everything I said it would.

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.688
I just needed his processor to run it.

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:02.289
<i>- Who is this?
</i>- Mr. Goddard?</i>

01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:04.329
<i>Who is this?</i>

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:08.161
You should really trash your e-mails
when you're done reading them.

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:13.090
I sent you all an e-mail
this morning

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:16.124
in which I encoded 3DPS-like data
to identify you.

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:22.762
Someone is always listening, Jock.

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:24.445
Always.

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:54.681
Mr. Goddard.

01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.524
Mr. Goddard, you're under arrest.

01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:00.207
I'm gonna make your life a living hell.

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:02.289
Please stand,
place your hands behind your back.

01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:05.608
Yes! We got him.

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:10.286
You did the right thing, kid.

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:12.283
The charges against you
include felony fraud,

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:17.002
industrial espionage,
obstruction of justice, insider trading.

01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:20.369
Augustine Goddard,
you have the right to remain silent.

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:23.444
Anything you say can
and will be used in a court of law.

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:26.483
<i>You have the right to an attorney.</i>

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:30.401
If you cannot afford an attorney,
the court will appoint one for you.

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:32.881
Do you understand these rights
as I have read them to you?

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.922
<i>I handed the Feds Wyatt and Goddard.</i>

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:46.286
<i>They won't be seeing light
for a very long time.</i>

01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:50.285
<i>Judith and Meachum got
what they deserved too.</i>

01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:55.524
<i>As for me, I got lucky.</i>

01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:58.206
<i>The Feds cut me a break
for my cooperation.</i>

01:34:58.680 --> 01:34:59.647
No...

01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:12.088
<i>The things I thought I wanted
don't seem so important anymore.</i>

01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:15.685
<i>I do know right from wrong, and...</i>

01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:20.131
<i>...I'm sorry it took me
so long to act on it.</i>

01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:25.009
<i>I just want you to know that</i>

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.401
<i>I never wanted to do any of this to you.</i>

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:32.402
<i>I hope one day I can make things right.</i>

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:39.680
<i>I'm sorry, Emma.</i>

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:52.966
Thanks.

01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:56.842
Go, go, go, go! Go! Go! Go!

01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:58.923
Run, run!

01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:06.567
What?

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:12.411
Did I ever tell you, you were right?

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.125
About what?

01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:17.491
Everything.

01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:23.244
I mean that.

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:25.289
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.

01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:43.083
How's it going with that girl?

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:46.971
Well, she won't talk to me.

01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:50.762
It ain't over till it's over.

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:55.561
You know how long it took me
to get a date with your mother?

01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:57.760
How long?

01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:02.762
A long time.

01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:08.123
And I was much better-looking then
than you are now.

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:11.090
- Oh, is that right?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:22.489
Where you going?
The subway is this way.

01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:24.927
I got a faster ride. Come on.

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:33.683
I thought we were done
with this shit?

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:35.808
It's a rental, Dad.
I got it for the day.

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:38.964
Oh, yeah?
Well, then, let's have some fun.

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:42.845
<i>One way to remember who you are...</i>

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:45.407
How do you open this thing?

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:47.847
<i>...Is to remember
who your heroes are.</i>

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:02.283
<i>I'm doing things my way now.</i>

01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:05.165
<i>Building from the ground up.</i>

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:07.482
<i>There are no shortcuts.</i>

01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:09.804
Oh my God, what are you doing?

01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:12.161
- What? I messed it up.
- We have a lot of things to do.

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:13.970
- Come on!
- All right, Jesus!

01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:19.120
Hi. Emma Jennings.

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:21.044
One second.

01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:25.607
Adam, you have a visitor.

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:38.326
Hey.

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:41.365
Hi.

01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:47.165
Nice place you have here.

01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:49.243
I mean, for Brooklyn.

01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:53.168
I'm glad you came.

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:56.967
Kept getting e-mails about a job offer
at a brand-new startup company.

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.404
Why I didn't see that coming...

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:03.723
Yeah, we, uh...

01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:06.281
We really need you here.

01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:08.450
You couldn't afford me.

01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:10.921
Lots of stock options.

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:16.082
You have to do better than that.

01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:27.921
I need you here.

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.930
I'll think about it.

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:53.999
Come on,
let me buy you a drink.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.843
You said you had a thing
for bridge-and-tunnel.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.128
Your words. Emma.

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:03.725
Can I at least thank you
for considering my offer?

01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:31.006
Thank you.

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:37.561
<i>I like being across the bridge.</i>

01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:41.887
<i>Over here, it feels like home.</i>

01:40:42.305 --> 01:40:48.843
