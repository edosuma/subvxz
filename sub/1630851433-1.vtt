WEBVTT

01:21.206 --> 01:23.666
-Mommy, I'm sleepy.
-Shh, shh.

01:25.543 --> 01:27.045
Shh, shh. Let's go.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.654
Daddy.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.035
"Shoop."

02:00.829 --> 02:03.706
We're gonna do "Shoop" later.

02:03.790 --> 02:04.791
-"Shoop."
-Shh, shh.

02:07.043 --> 02:08.378
What are you doing?

02:09.546 --> 02:11.256
-Hey, what are you doing?

02:12.340 --> 02:13.258
Hey, wait!

03:28.458 --> 03:29.292
Ten on 2, please.

03:49.270 --> 03:52.148
Leave a message or don't, you do you.

03:54.859 --> 03:57.779
Leave a message or don't, you do you.

04:07.038 --> 04:10.458
I'm gonna find us some place to sleep.
I'll be right back.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.345
-Alex?
-Thank God you're here.

04:22.428 --> 04:25.431
I'm sorry to barge in like this.
I called you, you didn't pick up.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.643
-I didn't know where else to go.
-What's wrong? Are you okay?

04:28.726 --> 04:29.769
It's not Maddy, is it?

04:29.852 --> 04:32.563
No, Maddy and I just need
a place to crash for tonight.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.983
Can I crash here
until I figure out what I'm doing?

04:35.066 --> 04:36.859
God, of course. Get in here.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.363
-Are the guys from the Swan here?
-Yeah.

04:40.905 --> 04:45.118
Thought I heard your voice. Come inside.
We got some sick dank from Humboldt.

04:45.201 --> 04:46.661
-Gotta get it.
-Do it.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.000
-Yeah.
-All right. Pass it. Chill.

04:52.959 --> 04:53.793
Hey.

05:03.428 --> 05:07.015
-Next time.
-Come on. He's already on his way over.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.726
He knows he drank too much.
Hear him out. He wants to talk.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.394
-Don't be a bitch.
-Ethan!

05:13.146 --> 05:15.106
-Sorry--
-I'm good. I'm all right.

05:15.189 --> 05:16.065
It's okay.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.109
-Do you have some place to go?
-I'm good.

05:29.454 --> 05:30.413
"Shoop."

05:31.164 --> 05:32.749
-Mm-mm.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.417
"Shoop" is asleep, Maddy.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.793
"Shoop."

05:36.461 --> 05:38.504
Can you try to close your eyes?

05:39.213 --> 05:40.798
"Shoop."

05:42.091 --> 05:44.302
Okay, I know you want "Shoop."

05:44.969 --> 05:46.763
I know you want "Shoop."

05:46.846 --> 05:50.808
Mommy wants to ask the last owner
if he jammed any other mixtape in here.

05:54.896 --> 05:58.357
-Hey, there we go. There we go.

06:18.127 --> 06:19.045
Mommy.

06:20.129 --> 06:24.217
That's okay. We're gonna freestyle it.
That's what we're gonna do.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.779
Gotta move, ma'am. You can't sleep here.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.284
Ma'am.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.661
You can't sleep here.

07:36.664 --> 07:39.584
-Isn't this public property?
-You can't park here.

07:40.084 --> 07:43.588
Got nowhere to be, go to a Walmart
parking lot or to social services.

07:44.881 --> 07:45.715
Okay.

07:47.008 --> 07:47.842
Now.

07:48.634 --> 07:49.469
Okay.

08:14.702 --> 08:15.536
Russell.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.122
That's us. Let's get it.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.333
-Russell?
-Russell, coming.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.881
So you're looking for a big,
fat government handout

08:26.964 --> 08:30.927
because you are a jobless, white trash,
piece of shit, am I right?

08:31.010 --> 08:31.844
What?

08:32.637 --> 08:35.515
Your form? You're gonna give that to me.

08:37.850 --> 08:38.976
Yes.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.233
All right. The child in your lap is Maddy.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.443
-And Schmariel.
-What?

08:48.277 --> 08:51.781
Uh, it's the Ariel that we got
from a dollar store.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.366
So we call her Schmariel.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.410
-Are you the child's legal guardian?
-Yes.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.787
Can you prove that?

08:59.288 --> 09:02.458
Uh, I can show you my stretch marks.

09:04.418 --> 09:07.421
Are you under the influence
of any drugs or alcohol?

09:08.839 --> 09:09.674
No.

09:10.299 --> 09:11.342
Are you sure?

09:12.260 --> 09:14.303
Because you look strung out.

09:15.805 --> 09:16.639
No.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.350
We slept in a car last night.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.394
So you're homeless?

09:21.477 --> 09:23.938
No. No, I wouldn't say that.

09:24.021 --> 09:25.523
So you have a home?

09:26.983 --> 09:28.317
Uh...

09:28.401 --> 09:30.987
I had a home and then we left it.

09:35.533 --> 09:39.537
Maddy's dad is, um-- He drinks and, uh...

09:40.788 --> 09:42.832
He blacks out and punches stuff.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.167
Is this some kind of
fucking fairy tale, Alex?

09:45.251 --> 09:46.335
-Punches you?
-No.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.713
-Punches Maddy?
-No. No.

09:48.796 --> 09:49.630
Just...

09:51.007 --> 09:52.425
Last night, um...

09:54.135 --> 09:56.262
Last night was different and I got scared.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.222
Did you file a police report?

09:59.223 --> 10:00.391
No.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.893
Do you wanna call the cops now?
It's not too late.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.688
And say what? That he didn't hit me?

10:07.523 --> 10:09.859
There's shelters
for domestic violence victims,

10:09.942 --> 10:12.612
but you need to go on record
with your abuse.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.280
I'm not abused.

10:16.699 --> 10:17.533
Okay, hon.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.746
So according to you,
you're not abused and you're not homeless.

10:22.246 --> 10:23.414
Why are you here?

10:26.584 --> 10:28.502
We don't have anywhere to sleep tonight.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.009
What about mom? It says here she's local.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.722
I would rather sleep in my car.

10:39.805 --> 10:40.848
Dad?

10:41.724 --> 10:42.933
Um...

10:43.017 --> 10:45.061
My family is not an option.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.979
Are you currently employed?

10:47.521 --> 10:51.233
-Nope.
-You went to six different high schools?

10:52.026 --> 10:56.947
Yeah, my mom moved around a lot
and then eventually I got my GED in 2016.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.909
Any college, technical schools?

10:59.992 --> 11:01.577
I got into college...

11:01.661 --> 11:04.163
um, but I didn't go.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.000
Is there anything that you can give me?

11:08.084 --> 11:10.544
Any special skills?

11:10.628 --> 11:14.423
On your mark, get set, go!

11:18.886 --> 11:19.720
No.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.392
All right. Here's the deal.

11:24.475 --> 11:27.895
I need two pay stubs in order to get you
on the list for subsidized housing,

11:27.978 --> 11:30.231
and even then, the wait list is long.

11:30.898 --> 11:34.527
In the meantime, there's a mission over
at St. Carmel's and they have beds open.

11:34.610 --> 11:37.405
I can't take Maddy there.

11:37.488 --> 11:38.322
Sure you can.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.450
Get there early. Wear Deet.

11:41.534 --> 11:46.205
Um, I'm sorry. Is there anything else
that you could do for us here?

11:46.288 --> 11:47.915
Honestly, without a job,

11:48.624 --> 11:50.042
I can't do squat.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.794
Okay. Um...

11:52.628 --> 11:54.922
I can't get a job
if I can't afford day care.

11:55.005 --> 11:59.677
Well, we have access to subsidized
day care grants once you have a job.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.515
I need a job to prove that I need day care
in order to get a job?

12:06.684 --> 12:08.436
What kind of fuckery is that?

12:12.064 --> 12:12.898
You know what?

12:14.233 --> 12:17.069
Why don't you try this?

12:19.071 --> 12:20.322
Value Maids?

12:20.865 --> 12:24.452
It's a local cleaning service,
lot of turnover. Worth a shot.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.662
I'll call them to tell them
you're on your way.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.581
-Great. Yeah. Thank you.
-Yeah?

12:28.664 --> 12:29.748
Can I bring Maddy?

12:31.041 --> 12:32.418
To a job interview?

12:46.599 --> 12:47.433
Mom!

12:55.774 --> 12:57.109
Is Paula here?

12:57.193 --> 12:58.486
Paula Langley?

12:58.569 --> 13:02.114
I don't know who Paula is.
We Airbnb'd this place from Basil.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.351
-Hi, Mom.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.479
Maddy, Alex!

13:34.313 --> 13:36.273
This is so exciting.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.567
I can't believe you came to see this.

13:38.651 --> 13:43.113
This is what all the brilliant painters
and sculptors are doing in the art world.

13:43.197 --> 13:46.867
This is me stepping up
to a global collective of minds.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.578
-Hey, Mom.
-Archetypes. You know about it.

13:49.662 --> 13:53.415
That's what I'm representing here
in cobalt.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.876
The hero, the every man, mentor,
the mystic

13:55.960 --> 13:57.127
-the lover.
-Mom.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.255
And there's Jungian archetypes.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.674
Why didn't you tell me
that you Airbnb'd your house?

14:01.757 --> 14:03.175
I did, didn't I?

14:03.259 --> 14:05.344
I drove around two campgrounds
looking for you.

14:05.427 --> 14:08.055
If you don't check-in with me,
that's on you.

14:08.138 --> 14:09.890
I called you 14 times.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.017
Is that Alexandra? Bloody hell.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.895
You disturbed the Airbnb people?

14:14.979 --> 14:18.107
They're gonna leave a shit review now,
you fair dinkum monster.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.818
I can't deal with him
and his fake Australian accent.

14:20.901 --> 14:23.362
It's not fake. I was born in Perth, so...

14:23.445 --> 14:27.157
-I'm sure you were, Cilantro.
-Don't call Basil Cilantro, Alex.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.034
Our identity is subjective.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.911
He's Australian, I'm French-Italian.

14:30.995 --> 14:33.664
In reality, we're both
100 percent Icelandic fairy.

14:33.747 --> 14:36.166
Can I talk to you in private?
I'm in a rush, Mom.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.253
No. Whatever you can say to me,
you can say in front of him.

14:39.336 --> 14:42.339
Because he is my life
and business partner.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.716
What business?

14:44.216 --> 14:47.303
Renting your house out,
or making you sleep in an RV?

14:47.386 --> 14:48.804
You're a malignant tumor.

14:48.888 --> 14:52.266
-Go put some shrimp on the barbie.
-All right. Enough.

14:53.142 --> 14:53.976
Out with it.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.937
-With--? Um...
-Out with it.

14:57.021 --> 15:00.274
You want something from me,
so just ask. What is it?

15:00.900 --> 15:04.737
Can you watch Maddy?
I have a job interview. One hour, two max.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.285
Of course. She's my granddaughter.

15:11.368 --> 15:15.414
She is always welcome to experience me
and be a part of my life.

15:15.497 --> 15:17.458
Do you remember the rules? Use your phone.

15:17.541 --> 15:20.711
Use your phone and answer the phone.
Okay, Mom?

15:20.794 --> 15:23.005
-Nod that you hear me.
-Nod.

15:23.088 --> 15:26.759
Don't drive her anywhere. Do you have
food here? Can you give her lunch?

15:26.842 --> 15:29.470
-We're a pub now, are we?
-Anything goes wrong, call me.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.055
Don't call Sean. Call me.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.473
Come on, pumpky-poo.

15:33.849 --> 15:37.061
Be a good girl for Grammy and Cilantro.
Love you.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.027
Bye, Mom!

15:46.236 --> 15:47.196
I love you!

15:50.532 --> 15:51.784
Put some eyes on her.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.564
Hi, I'm looking for Value Maids?

16:24.108 --> 16:26.110
Sorry, the address says it's here.

16:32.324 --> 16:33.158
Thank you.

16:45.796 --> 16:46.755
Yeah?

16:48.924 --> 16:51.260
Hi, are you Yolanda?

16:52.177 --> 16:54.722
If this is another summons,
shove it up your ass.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.807
No, I'm Alex. Jody sent me.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.853
Oh, one of Jody's girls.

17:01.729 --> 17:05.899
Poor thing. Not you. Jody.
Being a social worker sucks.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.443
So you're on parole?

17:07.860 --> 17:09.403
Um, no.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.864
-Got any priors?
-No.

17:11.947 --> 17:14.199
I'll check. Got a problem
with a background check?

17:14.992 --> 17:18.412
-No.
-We pay that, no exceptions.

17:18.495 --> 17:21.874
Bump you up 50 cents once the background
check clears and you go full-time.

17:23.792 --> 17:24.710
Full-time, great.

17:24.793 --> 17:27.921
Yes, but full-time ain't a 40-hour week.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.632
Company policy is you can't work
more than six hours a day.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.343
More than six hours,
bitches start throwing their backs out,

17:33.427 --> 17:36.263
which breaks my heart, it does,
but I can't be paying benefits.

17:36.346 --> 17:39.933
So it's capped. Six hours a day, max.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.438
Okay.

17:44.521 --> 17:48.692
And tourist season's over,
so I really only have one shift open.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.862
It's a weekly three-hour clean
over on Fisher Island.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.240
One shift. Okay.

17:55.324 --> 18:00.120
So uniform is 25 bucks.
Comes out of your first check.

18:03.665 --> 18:07.044
How soon do you think I could get
proof of employment? A pay stub.

18:07.961 --> 18:10.589
Cart before the horse. This is a trial.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.299
You ain't hired yet.

18:12.382 --> 18:14.384
-You got a car?
-Yes.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.887
We provide a ferry pass.

18:16.970 --> 18:19.348
But gas and toll, that's on you.

18:19.431 --> 18:22.643
So are cleaning supplies, rags, gloves,

18:22.726 --> 18:25.854
basically everything else
except the Dyson.

18:27.022 --> 18:30.150
If you don't return the Dyson to me
directly after the shift,

18:30.234 --> 18:32.903
-you don't get paid. Understand?
-Yes, I do.

18:32.986 --> 18:36.240
All right. Can you do there at00?
Let me get you the sheet.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.283
Oh, so I'm starting today?

18:38.909 --> 18:40.702
That's good news, ain't it, broke girl?

18:44.289 --> 18:45.124
Great.

19:51.857 --> 19:55.319
-Hello.
-Hey, Mom. How's it going?

19:55.402 --> 19:57.112
She's a very powerful archetype.

19:57.196 --> 20:01.950
A love child. That's what she is,
her spirit resounds.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.703
-Did you feed her?
-The spirit of my mother is in her.

20:04.786 --> 20:10.209
She is a very powerful young lady.
Our ancestry pulses through her blood.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.669
Sure does. Did you end up
giving her lunch, though?

20:12.753 --> 20:17.758
Of course. Grilled cheese and tomato
with a side of straight Tom Collins

20:17.841 --> 20:19.843
and now we are painting.

20:19.927 --> 20:22.262
-Aren't we, sweetie? We're painting.
-Awesome.

20:22.346 --> 20:25.891
Hey. So listen. I got hired
and I'm starting right now.

20:25.974 --> 20:29.728
You should see what she's doing.
And her hands, they're like sculptures.

20:29.811 --> 20:34.233
-Listen, I'm starting right now.
-Oh, honey. It's just so pretty.

20:34.316 --> 20:37.694
-Her painting.
-It's a three-hour clean on Fisher Island.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.489
You should see her hands!
Look at her hands!

20:40.572 --> 20:44.993
I'll be back at the ferry at- 05 and
I'll be at yours at- 30. Does that work?

20:48.705 --> 20:49.790
Don't we, sweetie?

22:49.034 --> 22:51.787
No phones. You're a half hour late.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.789
-I'm sorry. I'm--
-A half hour late.

22:54.748 --> 22:58.418
I know. I didn't have any signal
and missed my turn. I'm sorry.

22:58.502 --> 22:59.544
We'll reschedule.

22:59.628 --> 23:04.508
I can be done by00, ma'am.
I'm fast and I'm good.

23:04.591 --> 23:06.551
I'd really rather
you come back another time

23:06.635 --> 23:09.971
than do a shoddy job and throw a bunch
of cleaning products around.

23:10.055 --> 23:13.934
I understand. I won't disappoint you.

23:17.354 --> 23:19.940
We're in NYC this weekend.
Everything in the fridge can go

23:20.023 --> 23:23.485
so my whole house doesn't smell
like kombucha when I get back. Got it?

23:25.153 --> 23:26.947
The fridge. I got it.

23:27.030 --> 23:31.952
We compost. The bin is labeled "compost."
Can you read or should I show you?

23:33.829 --> 23:35.080
I can read.

23:37.749 --> 23:40.502
Oh, God. Just put them on.
I'll talk to her.

23:40.585 --> 23:43.171
Tell them those terms are bullshit.

23:51.721 --> 23:52.556
Okay.

25:12.552 --> 25:15.555
Tick-tock. Should have rescheduled.

25:39.329 --> 25:40.413
Mommy.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.295
It's a tiara.

26:08.108 --> 26:10.151
Mommy, are you okay?

26:12.320 --> 26:14.572
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay, Mommy?

26:18.243 --> 26:19.327
Are you okay?

26:20.203 --> 26:21.288
Hey.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.415
Why are you on the floor?

26:25.250 --> 26:26.376
Oh, what happened?

26:26.459 --> 26:29.004
I heard a thunk. I think you fainted.

26:29.879 --> 26:31.423
Or are you a drug addict?

26:33.341 --> 26:35.760
Uh, no. Um...

26:36.511 --> 26:39.848
I'm so sorry. I skipped breakfast
this morning. I'm fine.

26:39.931 --> 26:42.726
Okay, well, just hold on.
Don't get up fast.

26:44.894 --> 26:46.062
Fuck.

26:46.980 --> 26:47.939
Okay.

27:03.496 --> 27:04.664
Balance bar.

27:06.708 --> 27:07.792
Thank you.

27:16.259 --> 27:18.053
This room is so nice.

27:18.136 --> 27:22.474
Gosh, I've got a daughter and
she would love this. How old is your kid?

27:24.768 --> 27:26.436
I don't have children.

27:30.231 --> 27:31.483
Isn't this a nursery?

27:32.817 --> 27:34.235
Yeah, it's staged.

27:35.111 --> 27:40.450
We're getting ready to sell the house.
So, uh... James had it staged.

27:42.952 --> 27:43.870
Oh.

27:45.538 --> 27:46.623
Well...

27:47.415 --> 27:49.709
Not to be a task master, but...

27:51.294 --> 27:52.295
Mm-hm.

27:53.046 --> 27:55.465
Obviously. Of course. I'm almost done too.

27:55.548 --> 27:57.217
I just have this room left and...

27:58.134 --> 28:00.553
This room and all the lawn furniture.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.400
Shit.

29:00.613 --> 29:04.492
Your call has been forwarded
to an automatic voice message system.

29:10.832 --> 29:14.669
Your call has been forwarded
to an automatic voice message system.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.428
Maddy?

29:24.512 --> 29:26.723
Maddy, are you in here? Maddy?

29:35.607 --> 29:37.734
Mom, can't you hear me calling?
What the fuck?

29:37.817 --> 29:42.947
Calling me? It was me
that was calling you many, many times.

29:43.031 --> 29:45.909
-Okay. Where is Maddy?
-I have a life of my own, you know?

29:45.992 --> 29:51.122
I can't be watching children all day.
I have work to do. My own work, okay?

29:51.206 --> 29:53.541
Basil, are you in here? Open the door!

29:53.625 --> 29:57.879
I bet you'd like to get in there with him.
I see how you act around him.

29:57.962 --> 30:00.590
Always flirting with him,
sticking your little titties out.

30:00.673 --> 30:03.009
What the fuck are you talking about?
Where is Maddy?

30:03.092 --> 30:06.971
-I'm taking a nap. Jesus.
-Why can't you be happy for me?

30:07.055 --> 30:08.056
She's not here.

30:08.139 --> 30:11.309
That I can still attract
a quality man like him.

30:11.392 --> 30:13.561
-Okay, where is she?
-We couldn't reach you

30:13.645 --> 30:16.815
and your mom got tired,
so we called Sean to get her.

30:19.692 --> 30:25.031
You have never seen my potential.
I am soaring on the cliff.

30:25.114 --> 30:30.662
The sun beams towards me.
It fills me with light!

30:50.932 --> 30:53.518
She's fine. She's all right. She's asleep.

30:59.399 --> 31:00.942
We did bath time.

31:02.026 --> 31:03.736
She had buttered noodles.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.037
You hungry?

31:14.372 --> 31:16.082
Dinner's almost ready.

31:16.165 --> 31:17.417
Irish stew.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.960
Fuck!

31:24.173 --> 31:27.010
I haven't had a drink today. Come on.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.012
Alex.

31:30.096 --> 31:31.347
I'm trying here.

31:32.307 --> 31:33.141
Hey.

31:33.224 --> 31:36.144
I'm not staying for dinner.
I'm getting Maddy and I'm leaving.

31:39.188 --> 31:40.815
I went to a meeting today.

31:42.901 --> 31:43.985
Ethan took me.

31:46.154 --> 31:47.530
Okay. That's...

31:48.323 --> 31:49.574
Could you please sit?

31:50.783 --> 31:52.994
-All right. Let's make a fucking mess!

31:54.454 --> 31:55.622
Fuck!

32:04.672 --> 32:05.840
You need to eat.

32:11.095 --> 32:11.930
Come on.

32:30.782 --> 32:34.369
I'm surprised Maddy was at your mom's.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.872
Is Paula finally on meds, or...?

32:41.125 --> 32:43.503
She was only supposed to be there
a couple of hours.

32:44.420 --> 32:46.255
You know how much I love Paula.

32:47.215 --> 32:50.635
I do, but... leaving Maddy with her?

32:52.637 --> 32:54.430
I thought we had an agreement.

33:00.019 --> 33:02.230
My mom's good with her
for short periods of time.

33:02.313 --> 33:06.025
They, um... dance around
or do art projects.

33:08.277 --> 33:09.696
She was alone when I got there.

33:10.571 --> 33:15.618
Playing with a vape
and watching a cage match on TV.

33:18.871 --> 33:20.123
Mm.

33:20.206 --> 33:22.542
Where were you? Nobody could find you.

33:23.918 --> 33:26.546
I got a job on Fisher Island,
and I didn't have service.

33:27.422 --> 33:28.339
A job?

33:30.466 --> 33:33.845
How are you gonna work?
Who's gonna watch Maddy?

33:34.429 --> 33:35.304
Not your mom.

33:35.388 --> 33:38.349
I'll figure it out.
It's my business, Sean, okay?

33:39.976 --> 33:40.852
Hmm.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.524
Could you eat a little?

33:49.736 --> 33:51.029
You're hurting my feelings.

34:01.581 --> 34:03.916
I'm not eating your fucking stew, okay?

34:05.418 --> 34:06.627
Stop asking.

34:09.505 --> 34:10.339
All right.

34:11.340 --> 34:13.342
You're officially freaking me out.

34:13.843 --> 34:16.095
Going AWOL in the middle of the night?

34:16.596 --> 34:20.975
Leaving my child in a dangerous
situation with a batshit crazy person?

34:21.059 --> 34:22.852
I mean, are you feeling okay?

34:25.354 --> 34:27.940
-That's not funny. Don't do that.
-What?

34:29.400 --> 34:32.653
I'm not insane. You're the one
that woke me up in a rage

34:32.737 --> 34:35.156
over some dirty dishes
and punched a hole in the wall.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.325
I drank too much. I went too far.

34:38.242 --> 34:40.161
I went too far, I'm sorry.

34:40.703 --> 34:43.456
I picked glass
out of Maddy's hair last night.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.084
I didn't mean for it to be
that close to her.

34:46.167 --> 34:49.587
Hey, I would never hurt her,
you know that.

34:50.630 --> 34:51.881
I don't know that.

34:52.590 --> 34:53.966
You serious right now?

34:54.926 --> 34:56.552
Okay, what's the plan here?

34:58.137 --> 35:00.681
Where are you gonna go? Hmm?

35:01.766 --> 35:03.226
I pay all the bills.

35:04.352 --> 35:06.771
Let you hang out with my friends,

35:06.854 --> 35:11.067
I let you move into my trailer,
you drink my beer, eat my food.

35:11.150 --> 35:12.985
I let you mooch off me.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.155
I do everything for you.

35:16.656 --> 35:19.200
If you walk out of here,
you'll have no one.

35:20.451 --> 35:24.163
I know. I'm well aware of how
completely alone and fucked I am.

35:24.247 --> 35:27.250
But I won't pick glass out of Maddy's
hair again. Not gonna happen.

35:27.875 --> 35:29.919
Hey, where are you going?

35:31.504 --> 35:33.673
-Hey. Hey, Maddy, sweetie.
-Daddy.

35:33.756 --> 35:35.258
Daddy's right here, okay?

35:35.341 --> 35:36.926
Where are you going, Alex?

35:37.009 --> 35:38.553
What's the plan here?

35:38.636 --> 35:41.472
Okay, why don't you think
for just one second?

35:42.723 --> 35:44.851
Would you please look at me? Alex?

35:44.934 --> 35:46.435
Why don't you come back inside?

35:46.519 --> 35:49.105
-We can talk about this.
-There you go, honey. It's okay.

35:49.188 --> 35:50.565
Where are you gonna go?

35:50.648 --> 35:52.400
Hey, you can't steal my kid!

35:53.151 --> 35:56.112
Sweetie, Daddy's right here, okay?
Where are you gonna go?

35:57.321 --> 35:58.531
Hey! Alex!

35:59.407 --> 36:00.241
Alex!

36:18.467 --> 36:19.385
"Shoop."

36:20.970 --> 36:21.888
"Shoop," Mommy.

36:25.308 --> 36:29.228
-Where are we going?
-I don't know. I need a second, all right?

36:29.312 --> 36:32.064
-Home.
-We can't go home right now, okay?

36:35.610 --> 36:36.944
Look, Mommy, look.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.238
I'm gonna take this real quick.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.074
Yolanda, the Dyson, I know.

36:42.158 --> 36:45.870
-Regina's not happy with your cleaning.
-What?

36:45.953 --> 36:49.498
She called and said you did a crap job
on the furniture, left streaks.

36:49.582 --> 36:52.251
-Go back, and do it right.
-Window, Mommy!

36:52.335 --> 36:54.378
-Yes, honey.
-Mommy.

36:54.462 --> 36:56.505
Okay, okay, hold on. I'm gonna...

36:57.798 --> 37:01.052
Nope, I can't. I'm in Port Hampstead,
and I have my daughter with me.

37:01.135 --> 37:05.056
Not my problem. You want this job?
You wanna get paid? Go back.

37:05.139 --> 37:08.476
-It's a 45-minute ferry each way.
-Then you better get cracking.

37:08.559 --> 37:10.686
You're flying.

37:10.770 --> 37:12.772
-Hold on, all right?
-Look, Mommy.

37:12.855 --> 37:15.066
We don't have time for this, Maddy.

37:17.068 --> 37:20.404
Schmariel!

37:20.488 --> 37:24.283
We'll go back and get Schmariel.
We're gonna get Schmariel later.

37:24.367 --> 37:26.202
-I'm getting Schmariel now.
-Schmariel!

37:26.285 --> 37:28.871
I'm getting her right now.
Okay. All right.

37:30.206 --> 37:31.040
Okay.

38:16.836 --> 38:18.045
Are you okay?

38:24.510 --> 38:26.345
You okay? You okay?

38:26.929 --> 38:28.639
You're okay. You're okay.

38:29.515 --> 38:32.518
Jesus Christ! She was in there?

38:33.519 --> 38:37.023
Yes, my daughter was fucking in the car!
She was in there, you fucking moron!

38:38.524 --> 38:41.902
You hit my fucking car.
You could have killed my daughter.

38:42.987 --> 38:45.448
Get the fuck away from me!

38:45.531 --> 38:47.199
We live in here, you dipshit!

38:56.292 --> 38:58.085
Oh, you're so good.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.338
And then shine the light.

39:01.380 --> 39:02.590
Yeah.

39:07.386 --> 39:08.554
Here you go, ma'am.

39:14.643 --> 39:18.356
-You're giving me a ticket?
-Parking in the meridian is illegal.

39:21.567 --> 39:23.027
I can't pay for this.

39:23.110 --> 39:26.072
If you have any personal items
you'd like to retrieve from the car

39:26.155 --> 39:28.366
before the tow truck gets here,
now is your time.

39:29.784 --> 39:31.619
And who pays for the tow truck?

39:34.121 --> 39:36.332
You have someone who can pick you up?

39:41.629 --> 39:45.341
If you don't have anybody to call,
we can drop you at home.

39:45.424 --> 39:48.594
Um, no, no, no. I've got--
I've got somebody. Thank you so much.

39:48.677 --> 39:51.347
Can you make the call now?
I gotta clear the meridian.

39:51.430 --> 39:53.808
-You can't stay here. All right.
-Got it.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.066
Were you speeding at the time?

41:32.281 --> 41:33.115
Hey.

41:58.182 --> 41:59.558
She's out like a light.

42:04.605 --> 42:07.274
Last time I saw her,
she was still in diapers.

42:07.942 --> 42:10.611
I would like to see her
more than I get to.

42:15.324 --> 42:17.326
So where to? Port Hampstead?

42:17.826 --> 42:20.079
Sean still in that single-wide?

42:21.580 --> 42:22.748
No, we're, um...

42:24.166 --> 42:25.668
We're not gonna go home.

42:28.712 --> 42:30.631
Oh. Okay.

42:32.341 --> 42:33.300
Where to, then?

42:35.344 --> 42:38.639
I mean, I'd invite you back to my house...

42:40.182 --> 42:42.518
but it's a school night,
and Charlene and the kids--

42:42.601 --> 42:43.811
No, yeah. Of course.

42:44.311 --> 42:45.145
Maybe, um...

42:46.564 --> 42:48.941
Would you mind just dropping us
at the ferry station?

42:49.024 --> 42:50.401
I'll have my friend pick us up.

42:56.156 --> 42:58.784
What were you thinking
pulled over like that?

42:58.867 --> 43:02.246
It's just that's...
a reckless thing to do.

43:04.164 --> 43:05.708
Reminds me of your mother.

43:14.216 --> 43:15.467
Can we just not talk?

43:18.846 --> 43:19.680
Okay.

43:29.315 --> 43:32.651
Would you mind pulling over real quick
and let me run to the dollar store?

44:08.062 --> 44:08.896
Thanks.

44:39.051 --> 44:41.011
Let's put you down. There you go.

44:42.846 --> 44:45.307
You, uh... You need anything else

44:45.391 --> 44:46.433
from your old pop?

44:46.517 --> 44:48.519
We're all set, thanks again.

44:49.561 --> 44:50.771
Bye-bye, honey bee.

45:07.371 --> 45:08.205
Boat.

45:08.997 --> 45:12.793
No, not tonight.
We're just gonna get a little rest in.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.800
Wait, wait. Come here, baby girl.

45:44.074 --> 45:47.161
-This was in my shoe.
-What's in your shoe?

45:47.244 --> 45:49.455
-This was in my shoe.
-What the heck?

45:49.538 --> 45:50.706
What the heck?

45:53.792 --> 45:54.835
Okay.

45:57.129 --> 45:59.423
I put it in my shoe.

46:01.383 --> 46:03.135
You're fixing my earrings, all right?

46:05.220 --> 46:09.308
How do we unclip this?

46:10.100 --> 46:11.059
Well...

46:13.604 --> 46:17.316
Okey-dokey. I got you a surprise.
You wanna see a surprise?

46:21.570 --> 46:22.488
Okay.

46:24.323 --> 46:26.742
Ta-da!

46:28.035 --> 46:29.203
We got Schmariel.

46:31.455 --> 46:32.372
All better.

47:00.859 --> 47:04.321
Announcing the arrival of Ferry 41.

47:05.781 --> 47:08.158
Ferry 41 arriving.
