00:52.085 --> 00:53.019
Hi. Hello.

00:53.853 --> 00:56.723
<i>Good morning, Siobhan.
Sorry to bother you today.</i>

00:58.691 --> 01:02.328
Hey, Sharon. Hi, no problem.

01:02.762 --> 01:05.465
<i>I wanted to discuss
your results and I didn't know,</i>

01:05.465 --> 01:07.500
<i>but I thought you would want
the chance to be aware,</i>

01:07.500 --> 01:10.603
<i>- if you're up to it.
- Yeah, sure. Okay.</i>

01:11.371 --> 01:13.640
<i>I won't draw it out. It's a good result.</i>

01:13.940 --> 01:16.242
<i>The journey we went on
with the amniocentesis</i>

01:16.242 --> 01:19.679
<i>after what the blood test showed us,
everything looks healthy.</i>

01:22.549 --> 01:23.550
Okay. Good.

01:25.452 --> 01:28.655
<i>Great. And you're still well?
No spotting, no bleeding?</i>

01:29.189 --> 01:31.591
<i>- Nope. No.
- Okay.</i>

01:32.425 --> 01:34.961
<i>Well, in terms of all the results
I have for you,</i>

01:35.228 --> 01:37.630
<i>there is nothing I think
we should be concerned about.</i>

01:39.165 --> 01:41.534
Okay. Great.

01:41.534 --> 01:45.438
<i>So, Davina will reach out to make
an appointment for your 20-week scan.</i>

01:46.272 --> 01:48.174
<i>But I'm thinking of you at this time.</i>

01:48.875 --> 01:50.710
<i>And if there's anything I can do...</i>

01:51.244 --> 01:54.314
Okay. Great. Thank you. Thanks, Sharon.

04:01.641 --> 04:05.378
You know, you fucked me.
You fucked me right in the ass here.

04:06.446 --> 04:08.748
What you've done, Juliet,
is you've taken a strap-on

04:08.748 --> 04:13.152
and you fucked me right in the ass,
yeah? Call me. Please.

04:22.295 --> 04:23.429
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

04:26.633 --> 04:27.900
- I will see you later.
- Okay.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.068
Yeah. Thanks.

04:33.139 --> 04:35.041
- Hello, Marcia.
- Hi, Kendall. Hi.

04:36.976 --> 04:38.177
<i>Mes condol√©ances.</i>

04:39.412 --> 04:40.513
Sorry for your loss.

04:41.547 --> 04:42.482
Thank you.

04:44.217 --> 04:45.685
- Likewise.
- Yes.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.820
It's a terrible shock.

04:48.655 --> 04:49.555
Right.

04:50.757 --> 04:54.694
And, where... where have you...
When did you get in?

04:55.228 --> 04:58.865
We spoke every morning and afternoon,
so I came as soon as I heard.

04:58.865 --> 04:59.866
Okay.

05:01.501 --> 05:02.568
Yeah, I mean...

05:05.338 --> 05:08.808
I honestly...
I didn't think you guys were...

05:09.842 --> 05:11.944
- You know?
- We were very close.

05:12.779 --> 05:16.883
It was complicated,
but we spoke intimately every evening.

05:18.551 --> 05:19.552
Right. Okay.

05:24.123 --> 05:26.125
- Graham, Janet.
- We're so sorry.

05:27.193 --> 05:30.663
Thank you so, so much
for your sending of flowers.

05:33.132 --> 05:35.101
- Praying for you, Ken.
- Thank you.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.337
It's so nice to see you, dear one.

05:41.874 --> 05:43.943
- Hey, brother.
- Sorry, Ken.

05:44.444 --> 05:46.279
Thank you. Thanks, Cyd.

05:56.856 --> 05:57.924
Sorry for your loss.

05:57.924 --> 06:00.827
- So sorry, Kendall.
- Thank you, Penny. Thanks. Thanks, Mark.

06:02.361 --> 06:03.463
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:03.463 --> 06:04.464
How you doing?

06:08.201 --> 06:09.135
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.212
What's up with Marcia?

06:19.679 --> 06:22.181
- The belle of the ball?
- Death becomes her.

06:22.882 --> 06:26.319
And, like, where's...
You know, where's Kerry?

06:27.887 --> 06:32.158
In Marcia's trunk. Inside
an anaconda. Inside a sarcophagus.

06:32.458 --> 06:35.394
You know that Marcia hasn't seen Dad in,
like, seven weeks.

06:35.728 --> 06:36.729
Says on his calendar.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.165
Intimate calls every night.
Did you get that one?

06:39.165 --> 06:40.833
No. I think I might sue her

06:40.833 --> 06:42.502
for making me think
of Dad doing phone sex.

06:44.537 --> 06:45.605
No?

06:45.938 --> 06:48.875
Yeah. No. I could do
a phone sex bit if you want.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.343
I just thought
you wouldn't be in the mood.

06:51.844 --> 06:52.945
Yeah, I'm actually... I'm fine.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.350
Like, I'm sure it'll crush me, eventually.

06:57.350 --> 07:00.520
Freight train a-coming!
But today I'm... Yeah, I'm okay.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.587
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:02.922 --> 07:03.956
I feel knocked out.

07:04.457 --> 07:06.025
- Yeah.
- I didn't sleep.

07:06.793 --> 07:08.928
I wonder if maybe I've just
thought about it so much,

07:08.928 --> 07:11.798
one way or another that I don't know,
I've maybe pre-grieved.

07:11.798 --> 07:13.933
Well, good for you. I mean...

07:15.334 --> 07:16.602
I don't believe you, but...

07:18.171 --> 07:20.106
No. Well...

07:21.007 --> 07:23.409
Either way, we should, you know,

07:23.409 --> 07:25.044
- huddle 'cause...
- Yeah, yeah.

07:25.745 --> 07:26.946
...for some of us, it's a sad day.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.882
But for others,
it's Coronation Demolition Derby.

07:31.851 --> 07:32.952
What's the schedule?

07:35.521 --> 07:37.023
Work call is 11:00 a.m., I think.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.570
Hey. How we doing?

07:51.671 --> 07:54.440
- You know.
- It's so strange being here...

07:54.440 --> 07:55.708
- Yeah.
- ...without him.

07:55.708 --> 07:59.545
- Indeed. Indeed. So, what have I missed?
- A lot of incoming.

07:59.912 --> 08:01.013
- Lot of incoming.
- Yes.

08:01.747 --> 08:03.216
Presidents. Prime ministers.

08:03.516 --> 08:05.718
- Yep.
- Just trying to keep everything stable.

08:06.018 --> 08:09.755
Board on the line in, what,
an hour to pick a new top dog.

08:10.089 --> 08:13.893
And what's your sense, Frank?
What are the CEO vibes?

08:15.194 --> 08:17.597
Would anyone care for...

08:21.300 --> 08:22.301
a look at the china?

08:28.040 --> 08:29.609
He was going to fire half that room.

08:29.609 --> 08:31.844
Do people know that?
Should we get that out there?

08:32.111 --> 08:34.814
No. We don't want it
to look like a shit show.

08:34.814 --> 08:39.118
You know, it's chaos narratives,
fratricide narratives, bad narratives.

08:39.886 --> 08:41.520
- Hey. Hey, guys.
- Hi.

08:42.321 --> 08:45.524
Man. I'm...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for your loss.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.159
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you.

08:48.527 --> 08:49.929
It's just great that we can all...

08:50.363 --> 08:53.532
The family can support each other
and stay strong through this.

08:54.066 --> 08:55.334
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Greg.

08:56.535 --> 08:59.038
My guys. My lovely guys.

08:59.405 --> 09:01.540
Okay. Hey, hey.
You know, we're not, like,

09:01.807 --> 09:03.409
- playing Chutes and Ladders. Okay?
- Sorry.

09:03.409 --> 09:07.747
- Our dad just died. And...
- No, I'm sorry. I'm sad.

09:08.781 --> 09:11.851
And just thinking about
how things will shake down. Right?

09:11.851 --> 09:13.319
There's the board meeting coming up

09:14.153 --> 09:16.956
any minute, and I talked to Ewan
and he'll have a say.

09:16.956 --> 09:19.292
- So...
- You need to get a new mommy. Okay?

09:19.625 --> 09:20.626
We're not your mommy.

09:21.794 --> 09:23.896
I'm... I'm getting a call here.
Could you maybe...

09:24.196 --> 09:25.398
- Thanks, Greg.
- Yeah. No, I mean it.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.532
- Seriously.
- Fuck right on off.

09:26.899 --> 09:27.967
- Thank you.
- Sorry, guys.

09:28.935 --> 09:30.803
Matsson. Do I?

09:31.904 --> 09:34.040
- Yeah.
- Let's just... Let's... let's...

09:34.473 --> 09:35.775
- just do five...
- Yeah.

09:35.775 --> 09:37.109
...and get our ducks in a row.

09:37.109 --> 09:39.912
Yeah? I mean, we fucking blurt
and he puts it on his socials,

09:39.912 --> 09:43.215
and suddenly we sold Manhattan
for glass beads. Right?

09:43.482 --> 09:45.284
Okay. I'll let it ring out.

09:47.119 --> 09:49.989
So, the aim is, we'd like
to make an announcement today.

09:50.589 --> 09:54.060
Stating who we think would take over
in the interim, ready for Monday.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.362
Right. And here's my position.

09:56.362 --> 09:59.165
I wonder if we don't want
to take control of the plane here.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.268
Yeah, well. The... I guess
the first thing is the GoJo deal.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.537
The board, the shareholders,
everyone's very keen.

10:04.537 --> 10:05.571
- So...
- No, exactly.

10:05.571 --> 10:08.574
And I tell you, I worry
about the kids' commitment to the deal.

10:08.574 --> 10:10.242
If we called around the board, Frank,

10:10.743 --> 10:12.979
you would hold a lot of sway
on the interim appointment.

10:12.979 --> 10:15.181
They'd like senior management
input, yeah.

10:15.181 --> 10:18.017
Right, and if the message
we gave was to be, you know,

10:18.017 --> 10:20.519
"But that the kids are..."

10:20.920 --> 10:22.054
Screw ups and dipshits.

10:22.855 --> 10:28.361
Maybe not constitutionally well-equipped
at this point to take on the role.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.362
Yeah.

10:30.096 --> 10:34.200
I guess the question then would just be,
"Who might we favor?"

10:34.467 --> 10:37.236
Gerri, obviously,
is a safe pair of hands.

10:37.236 --> 10:38.938
- She's done it recently.
- Yeah.

10:39.939 --> 10:42.008
Although, obviously, generally speaking,

10:42.008 --> 10:44.877
the CFO might be considered
the natural interim.

10:44.877 --> 10:49.081
Yeah. I guess you've already had
your tilt at the windmill on here.

10:49.081 --> 10:51.684
Exactly. I've already done it.
And quite successfully.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.688
And it's an interim role to do the deal.
I'd get it done.

10:56.122 --> 10:58.090
Buckle you
into your golden parachute, Karl.

10:58.457 --> 11:02.895
Well... Don't push me out
the plane so fast there, Gerr.

11:03.629 --> 11:06.165
Well, with the old man gone,
I can't help but wonder

11:06.165 --> 11:10.269
- if I don't have a little left to give.
- Look. You're a corporate legend.

11:10.703 --> 11:13.239
What you did in the '90s with cable?

11:14.540 --> 11:16.942
- Huge.
- Logan was souring on you.

11:16.942 --> 11:18.310
Well, Logan's not around anymore.

11:20.546 --> 11:22.281
- I would just like to say...
- Yeah.

11:22.281 --> 11:25.384
...to this senior group
of very respected greybeards

11:25.384 --> 11:29.688
that all I have ever personally asked
is the chance to serve.

11:31.490 --> 11:32.625
I mean, I'm sick with grief.

11:32.992 --> 11:34.427
- You're sick with grief?
- But I...

11:34.827 --> 11:36.629
Well, you might want
to put down that fish taco.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.130
You're getting
your melancholy everywhere.

11:38.130 --> 11:41.801
Very funny,
but were the opportunity to arise,

11:41.801 --> 11:46.305
all I would say is that if there's
a ring, my hat's in, respectfully.

11:48.474 --> 11:50.342
Well, I would just say,

11:51.177 --> 11:53.913
if we were to recommend you
to the board,

11:54.180 --> 11:57.183
the question they might ask, would...

11:57.650 --> 11:59.752
Can... Can I frame the question for you?

11:59.752 --> 12:01.053
- But as a friend.
- Sure.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.689
- Just so... so you'd be... be prepared.
- Sure.

12:04.123 --> 12:05.825
The negative case would go,

12:06.625 --> 12:09.462
you're a clumsy interloper
and no one trusts you.

12:09.929 --> 12:12.531
The only guy pulling for you is dead.

12:12.898 --> 12:16.035
And now, you're just married
to the ex-boss' daughter.

12:16.702 --> 12:22.174
And she doesn't even like you.
And you are fair and squarely fucked.

12:24.510 --> 12:25.478
Jesus, Karl.

12:26.045 --> 12:27.046
Frank.

12:27.046 --> 12:29.181
- Can I grab you for a second?
- Sure. Yeah.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.463
<i>Hi. This is Oskar on Lukas's phone.</i>

12:45.931 --> 12:49.168
Hey, Oskar. This is Roman Roy.

12:49.168 --> 12:52.471
Lukas called but I was just rounding up
my chimpanzee friends

12:52.471 --> 12:54.206
'cause they want to say hi too.
Is he there?

12:56.108 --> 12:57.877
<i>No. He... he won't now, he says.</i>

12:59.712 --> 13:02.882
Yeah, okay. All right.
So, can you get him, please?

13:02.882 --> 13:06.418
<i>Yeah, well. He was
calling last chance, unfortunately,</i>

13:06.418 --> 13:11.056
<i>because, you know, we have this
company strategy sesh this week.</i>

13:11.056 --> 13:13.359
Hey, this is Kendall. Come on, man.

13:14.927 --> 13:17.730
We dropped a call because we wanted
to all be on out of respect.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.932
Can you grab him?
It wasn't a power play.

13:20.733 --> 13:24.336
<i>Sure, man. No, that's cool. No, we know.
This isn't from him.</i>

13:24.336 --> 13:26.572
<i>He's just on a super tight schedule now.</i>

13:26.572 --> 13:29.175
Okay.
Well, does he just not want to say hi?

13:29.475 --> 13:30.910
You know, is he still
buying the company?

13:32.511 --> 13:35.014
<i>Sure, man.
Maybe, if you don't squeeze too tight.</i>

13:35.014 --> 13:37.449
<i>No, no. He's excited
to speak to you guys.</i>

13:38.117 --> 13:41.453
<i>- Who will be leading?
- We're just huddling on that now.</i>

13:41.453 --> 13:43.956
- We're a pretty fluid group.
- Yeah.

13:45.624 --> 13:50.429
But listen, it seems like maybe
your retreat has come at a good time.

13:51.463 --> 13:55.901
Yeah? You guys get your ducks in a row.
We do our board, pick our captain.

13:55.901 --> 13:58.070
We can reconfigure
in a week or whatever.

14:01.740 --> 14:04.310
<i>Yeah. Well, we don't...
we don't want to lose momentum.</i>

14:05.177 --> 14:06.779
Okay. No, nor us.

14:08.047 --> 14:11.016
You obviously know
what happened here yesterday, right?

14:11.850 --> 14:16.055
<i>Sure. Yeah, yeah.
We really feel for you guys. Bad one.</i>

14:16.455 --> 14:18.991
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, bad one.
Thank you for that. Thanks.

14:19.625 --> 14:24.663
<i>Yeah. But, could you guys or whoever,
one of the old guys you have,</i>

14:24.663 --> 14:26.665
<i>like, be here in 24 hours to do this?</i>

14:28.734 --> 14:32.104
Sorry, our... our dad just died,
and we have the election coming up.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.407
How would you feel
about doing a meet in the U.S.?

14:35.808 --> 14:38.277
<i>To have here...
This... this is the annual retreat.</i>

14:38.277 --> 14:39.578
<i>We can't just drop it.</i>

14:40.546 --> 14:43.182
No, I totally see that. Fine.

14:44.917 --> 14:46.151
- Marcia.
- Yeah.

14:48.053 --> 14:51.523
I am so sorry for your loss.

14:51.523 --> 14:54.026
Thank you. See how they run.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.997
Yes. Scurrying like little rats.

14:59.365 --> 15:00.866
- Hi.
- Hi, Marcia.

15:00.866 --> 15:02.034
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:02.034 --> 15:03.569
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

15:04.136 --> 15:05.237
To you too, Connor.

15:06.605 --> 15:07.673
- Hi.
- Thank you.

15:07.673 --> 15:09.108
Marcia, we'll catch up later.

15:09.608 --> 15:10.709
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay.

15:11.343 --> 15:12.278
Okay.

15:12.911 --> 15:15.047
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

15:15.047 --> 15:16.849
- Look how far you've come.
- Yep.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.351
Well, look at us both. Right?

15:21.420 --> 15:25.791
I'm sorry about everything. I mean,
after your wedding, to have to do this.

15:26.892 --> 15:28.360
We're going to head off next week.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.962
You know, we've got
a little trip planned out.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.699
Wisconsin, Minnesota,
Michigan, Pennsylvania.

15:33.699 --> 15:35.301
The honeymoon states.

15:36.135 --> 15:37.336
Sorry, sorry.

15:37.336 --> 15:38.537
- I'm just going to...
- All right.

15:40.239 --> 15:42.374
I wanted to say, because...

15:43.709 --> 15:45.144
these things could happen in a flash.

15:45.778 --> 15:49.915
But if and when the time comes
for you to consider selling this place,

15:50.849 --> 15:51.850
I would be...

15:54.520 --> 15:55.854
I'm worried to even say the words.

15:55.854 --> 15:57.823
- But I would be... I...
- No need to be ashamed.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.191
We're family.

15:59.958 --> 16:04.463
I will be looking for
between 60 and 70 million.

16:05.331 --> 16:08.300
All right. Okay.

16:09.034 --> 16:10.669
- Yeah.
- So, like...

16:10.669 --> 16:11.937
Yeah.

16:11.937 --> 16:14.139
- Sixty-three or...
- Done.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.675
- Done?
- Yeah. Done.

16:18.711 --> 16:19.945
Okay.

16:20.779 --> 16:21.714
Yeah.

16:23.182 --> 16:24.550
- Done.
- Great.

16:27.686 --> 16:31.256
Karl, hey. Come here a second.
I want to talk to you about something.

16:31.857 --> 16:36.729
In my role as executor,
I've had passed to me

16:36.729 --> 16:38.931
a rather worrying piece of paper.

16:41.867 --> 16:44.036
M'kay. And...

16:50.542 --> 16:51.577
Who else knows?

16:51.577 --> 16:54.179
As of now, as far as I know,
just you and me.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.748
So, what are you thinking?

16:55.748 --> 16:59.017
Well, I honestly didn't even want
to start thinking till you were here.

17:00.219 --> 17:05.457
I mean, could it, might it just go away?

17:07.526 --> 17:11.230
I mean, it might get lost.
I hope it doesn't.

17:11.930 --> 17:17.236
But what if your hand goes a little
wobbly and the draft takes it away,

17:17.236 --> 17:20.139
and it gets flushed down a toilet
by mistake.

17:20.606 --> 17:22.307
- I'm kidding, of course.
- No, sure, you're...

17:22.307 --> 17:24.476
you're speculating in a comic mode.

17:24.476 --> 17:26.011
Yeah. In a humorous vain.

17:27.546 --> 17:30.315
We're not going to let
the little princess screw things up.

17:30.315 --> 17:33.285
Right, Frank? If Gerri's
going to block me, I want out.

17:33.719 --> 17:37.623
I want my fucking package.
I am halfway in on a Greek island

17:37.623 --> 17:39.091
with my brother-in-law.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.093
- Say, what's up, boys?
- Hi.

17:42.094 --> 17:43.495
- Okay, well...
- Well,

17:44.029 --> 17:46.632
I've just been handed
a piece of paper, Gerri.

17:47.533 --> 17:53.138
It's... it has a list of wishes
in the event of Logan's death.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.707
- Funeral arrangements, so on.
- May I?

17:56.775 --> 17:57.709
Paragraph three.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.081
And where was this found?

18:03.515 --> 18:05.317
In his private safe.

18:05.317 --> 18:07.386
And this penciled addendum is what?

18:07.386 --> 18:10.289
We haven't touched it.
The underline in the pencil is his.

18:10.689 --> 18:15.427
Undated, apparently. Not even shared
with his lawyer or myself, so...

18:16.495 --> 18:17.796
So, what are you thinking?

18:19.097 --> 18:22.367
Well, legally, since the family
doesn't have full control,

18:22.367 --> 18:24.036
- legally, it wouldn't...
- Legally,

18:24.036 --> 18:25.571
it's up to the board
to decide who's next...

18:25.571 --> 18:27.105
- Right.
- ...so, this is not germane.

18:27.506 --> 18:29.608
Right, it's not germane. Not germane.

18:31.009 --> 18:33.178
We were joking
that it could fall in the toilet.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.383
Yes. Well, that is a very funny joke.

18:39.151 --> 18:42.921
You know, they say it's a bad idea
to make big decisions right after...

18:42.921 --> 18:47.326
Sure. But they also say it's pretty
smart not to pay realtors fees.

18:47.759 --> 18:50.395
And it's such a bitch to get
into these good buildings.

18:52.564 --> 18:53.699
All right, well...

18:53.699 --> 18:54.766
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

18:54.766 --> 18:56.134
- Hey, Con.
- Hey.

18:56.535 --> 18:57.636
How are we faring?

18:58.337 --> 19:00.072
- How are you?
- You know.

19:00.072 --> 19:04.142
<i>- Seen the obits?
- Sure. You like the Globe photo?</i>

19:05.177 --> 19:07.346
Did any of you guys
ever see him laugh like that?

19:07.679 --> 19:09.214
Only if a hobo was on fire.

19:10.048 --> 19:12.518
Yeah. I mean, to be honest,
Dad sounds amazing.

19:12.518 --> 19:13.886
I'd like to have met Dad.

19:14.353 --> 19:16.822
- But you guys are okay, really?
- Yeah.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.691
Yeah, Roman has pre-grieved.
Already gave at the office.

19:19.691 --> 19:23.095
They don't fucking believe me.
You know, from where I'm sitting,

19:23.095 --> 19:24.830
you're the ones that look naive, okay?

19:24.830 --> 19:27.065
I've been worried that
this was going to happen for ages.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.068
- How you doin'?
- I have no clue.

19:31.503 --> 19:32.437
I'm okay.

19:32.437 --> 19:33.572
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

19:34.573 --> 19:35.841
- You okay?
- Me?

19:37.075 --> 19:39.111
You're going to laugh
but in the middle of the night,

19:39.511 --> 19:45.317
I did a talk, like, a session.
My therapist recommended someone,

19:45.317 --> 19:48.654
and I got to him and he's...
he's kind of good.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.090
I have his number if you want.

19:53.659 --> 19:56.595
Like, it's dumb
but there's actually things you can do.

19:57.396 --> 19:59.665
I mean, sounds like you've got
the best grief guy.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.201
I have a great grief guy. Fuck you.

20:04.369 --> 20:05.804
You're going to destroy this.

20:06.572 --> 20:10.042
Hi, guys. Some more hard copies.

20:10.342 --> 20:11.977
- Obituaries.
- The reviews are in.

20:11.977 --> 20:15.347
- Great.
- Yeah. They're mostly five stars.

20:15.347 --> 20:18.383
And I think the board
will assemble now at noon.

20:18.717 --> 20:19.718
Okay, thanks, Hugo.

20:20.285 --> 20:22.921
- Okay. Ken.
- Yeah?

20:22.921 --> 20:25.257
Can I... can I ask you something?

20:25.257 --> 20:28.794
Just for one second, sorry,
just something quickly.

20:28.794 --> 20:30.729
- Yeah.
- Just take a second.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.065
Private.

20:34.700 --> 20:37.302
Ken, I may have...

20:38.971 --> 20:41.273
caught myself up
in a little bit of something.

20:42.307 --> 20:46.311
Probably nothing but I'm...
I'm sorry to bother you with this.

20:46.878 --> 20:47.813
Okay. What?

20:48.680 --> 20:50.916
I just found out that my daughter,

20:51.583 --> 20:54.152
she happened to sell
a bunch of Waystar stock

20:54.653 --> 20:59.458
just before the news
about your father went... went public.

21:01.426 --> 21:02.828
A total coincidence.

21:03.762 --> 21:06.732
But I... I don't want it
to come up as an issue, you know?

21:07.165 --> 21:10.836
Did you speak to her on the day?
What are the phone records going to say?

21:12.604 --> 21:14.106
I can't recollect.

21:18.243 --> 21:19.244
Hugo.

21:19.778 --> 21:24.282
I don't even have a relationship
with Juliet, that's the sad fact.

21:25.283 --> 21:26.952
The irony is, we hardly talk and...

21:29.287 --> 21:30.188
Thanks, Ken.

21:33.191 --> 21:34.126
Anything good?

21:34.426 --> 21:38.797
<i>The Courier. You need
a code book for this one. You ready?</i>

21:39.064 --> 21:39.998
Yeah.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.000
"A complicated man."

21:43.101 --> 21:44.403
Threw phones at staff.

21:45.370 --> 21:48.006
- It's good.
-"Sharp reader of the national mood."

21:48.373 --> 21:49.474
He's a bit racist.

21:51.443 --> 21:53.345
Well, then.
"He was very much a man of his era."

21:55.047 --> 21:59.184
Again, racist.
Also, relaxed about sexual assault.

21:59.584 --> 22:03.388
-"Business genius."
- Never paid a penny in U.S. tax.

22:04.189 --> 22:05.323
- That's... Yeah.
- Boom.

22:07.292 --> 22:10.295
-"Well-connected."
-"Well-connected." Now, that's not fair.

22:10.562 --> 22:13.899
I feel like well-connected
is generally accepted

22:13.899 --> 22:15.434
to be a euphemism for pedophile,

22:15.434 --> 22:18.170
and no one ever suggested
that he would, you know...

22:18.170 --> 22:19.438
- Fuck a child.
- Yeah.

22:19.805 --> 22:23.008
Yeah. He wouldn't even hug
his grandkids.

22:26.211 --> 22:29.281
Hey, guys. Sorry. I think they want
to see you up in the library.

22:32.984 --> 22:33.985
All right, let's go.

22:38.290 --> 22:39.357
Thanks.

22:41.460 --> 22:42.427
Hey, Ken.

22:42.928 --> 22:45.363
- Hey, Tom.
- Hey, I just wanted to say, you know,

22:45.363 --> 22:48.300
I know there's a lot of water under
the bridge, a lot of history.

22:48.767 --> 22:52.404
But as far as I am concerned,
the... the big man passing

22:53.171 --> 22:56.141
cleaned the slate.
So, yeah. I just... Yeah.

22:57.109 --> 22:59.377
I just want to say that
and you know, I wish,

22:59.377 --> 23:03.348
maybe, there's some things
I could maybe take back, some words.

23:03.348 --> 23:05.650
And I'm sorry for your loss.
But I want you to know that I'm...

23:05.650 --> 23:07.819
that I'm here to serve. Right here.

23:10.255 --> 23:13.125
I like you, Tom. Good luck.

23:21.133 --> 23:22.400
- Hey. Hi.
- Hello.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.169
- Hello.
- Yeah. Come on in. Have a seat.

23:24.169 --> 23:26.471
What's up? Yeah, I know.
We're in. Okay?

23:26.471 --> 23:27.506
- No, thanks.
- How are you doing?

23:28.406 --> 23:30.976
- Yeah. Hanging in.
- So, look.

23:32.144 --> 23:34.846
I'm one of the executors
of your dad's affairs.

23:35.714 --> 23:37.516
This is not a legal matter.

23:37.516 --> 23:40.185
But certain wishes have been discovered.

23:40.585 --> 23:44.456
And it appears
at a certain point, undated,

23:45.323 --> 23:47.526
it was suggested
that it was your dad's wish

23:47.859 --> 23:50.762
that Kendall take over as CEO.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.370
- From when?
- Well, it was in the safe.

23:59.037 --> 24:01.573
Between pieces
on the Raymada acquisition

24:01.573 --> 24:04.376
and the first U.S.
Virgin Islands reorganizations.

24:04.376 --> 24:05.744
- It's old. It's...
- So, it's...

24:05.744 --> 24:08.647
So, as far as we can tell,
from four years ago or so.

24:09.114 --> 24:14.619
Yeah. Then, it looks like there are
pencil addendums from another time, I...

24:14.619 --> 24:17.088
We don't know its status. And I mean,

24:17.088 --> 24:21.059
it doesn't hold any legal value.
But we wanted you to know,

24:21.059 --> 24:23.895
but we wouldn't want it to feel
more significant than it should.

24:23.895 --> 24:27.732
Because the family no longer
has majority control of Waystar,

24:27.999 --> 24:30.735
so any such suggestions are non-binding.

24:31.136 --> 24:33.205
Dad was the founder.

24:34.172 --> 24:35.807
- So...
- Of... of course,

24:35.807 --> 24:38.376
it is from some time ago
and things changed.

24:39.010 --> 24:43.548
- And Logan was a man of different moods.
- Yeah. Yeah.

24:44.316 --> 24:48.920
There are some additions in pencil
that he put in about artifacts.

24:49.788 --> 24:50.922
- Can I?
- And I think...

24:50.922 --> 24:55.393
We think from context, they were
added maybe in the last 18 months.

24:55.994 --> 24:58.663
So, he underlined recently?

25:02.634 --> 25:06.071
- Underlined or crossed out?
- Shiv.

25:06.972 --> 25:09.374
No, no, no.
I'm not saying for or against.

25:09.374 --> 25:11.509
I'm just... As a matter of fact, it's...

25:11.509 --> 25:13.044
- Are you serious?
- I mean,

25:13.044 --> 25:14.279
- it's kinda...
- I mean... Okay. Okay,

25:14.279 --> 25:15.347
let me see the thing.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.215
It's underlined or crossed out,
it doesn't...

25:17.215 --> 25:20.151
it doesn't really matter because it's...
Legally, it's the board,

25:20.151 --> 25:22.120
- yeah, who will choose.
- Exactly.

25:22.120 --> 25:25.457
The market, the shareholders, the board,
we all want the sale to go through.

25:25.457 --> 25:29.361
- So, it's an interim position, really.
- Sure. I mean, anyone could do that.

25:30.562 --> 25:34.032
And since he said...
I mean... I mean, he has said...

25:34.532 --> 25:35.767
I mean, Ken.

25:36.201 --> 25:40.338
Sure, man. I get it.
But like, this... this thing is old

25:40.338 --> 25:42.841
and you've tried to put him in jail,
like, twelve times since then. So...

25:42.841 --> 25:44.843
I... I wonder what was the, you know,

25:44.843 --> 25:48.914
the underlining or the crossing out
and the unknown age...

25:48.914 --> 25:50.448
The document isn't essentially moot.

25:50.448 --> 25:52.617
You know, it's impossible to decipher.

25:53.251 --> 25:55.687
Well, it sure as fucking shit
doesn't say "Shiv."

25:58.790 --> 26:01.159
- Okay.
- So, what else is in the fucking...

26:01.159 --> 26:04.062
- Can you... I don't want to...
- Music, burial in the city, Catholic.

26:04.062 --> 26:05.063
You can see.

26:05.063 --> 26:07.999
Should I get Greg now?
Just clear this up. Excuse me.

26:09.534 --> 26:13.405
There's a mix of business and personal.
A watch for Colin.

26:13.405 --> 26:16.074
Honestly, it looks like
he drafted it himself,

26:16.074 --> 26:18.543
never sent it to his lawyer
and just put it in the safe.

26:19.110 --> 26:23.114
I mean,
more of a selection of musings, really.

26:23.114 --> 26:26.918
Some thoughts on the tax position
or some artwork in storage.

26:26.918 --> 26:29.220
What... what does he have?

26:29.220 --> 26:32.223
He's got, like, a shit ton
of investment impressionisms. Right?

26:32.223 --> 26:35.427
Like, he's got three Gauguins
no one's seen for tax reasons, so...

26:35.427 --> 26:38.596
I think his suggestion was,
it might be smart tax-wise

26:38.596 --> 26:40.198
to just leave them in the Geneva vault.

26:40.198 --> 26:43.001
Fuck it. Why not just burn them
for the insurance, no?

26:43.001 --> 26:45.470
Yeah, that would be the dream.
Financially speaking.

26:45.470 --> 26:46.571
- Hey, everyone.
- Yes.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.173
- Greg.
- Hey, Greg.

26:48.173 --> 26:49.174
Hey.

26:50.375 --> 26:51.509
In case it comes out,

26:51.509 --> 26:54.379
we wanted you to be aware
that you're on a piece of paper.

26:55.046 --> 26:57.716
A side letter left by Logan with...

26:59.050 --> 27:00.819
some wishes and disbursements.

27:01.152 --> 27:06.391
Okay. Yeah. In... in what capacity?
In... in what fashion?

27:06.391 --> 27:09.861
You're in addendum
of miscellaneous matters in pencil

27:10.862 --> 27:12.864
- with a question mark.
- Nevertheless.

27:13.798 --> 27:17.569
Dad may have said
he wanted me to take over.

27:18.503 --> 27:23.408
And so then maybe the natural conclusion
might perhaps be, I'd be his number two.

27:27.679 --> 27:28.747
Nice try, kid.

27:28.747 --> 27:32.183
He probably wrote it down
so he can remember your name.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.453
- We had a good rapport.
- You had a good rapport?

27:35.453 --> 27:37.489
I feel like he already wanted
to see less of you.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.625
That's probably, like, 50/50,
fire Greg or kill Greg.

27:41.126 --> 27:45.797
I think that it's not that kind of
question mark. I think it's, possibly...

27:45.797 --> 27:46.931
- It's a wonder.
- It's a doodle.

27:46.931 --> 27:48.566
We just wanted you to be aware.

27:48.933 --> 27:52.637
Hey. Sorry. Marcia wanted me
to let you know that there's some words,

27:53.038 --> 27:54.706
- down, some informal...
- Okay.

27:54.706 --> 27:56.241
Well, there's a lot to consider.

27:56.541 --> 27:59.077
Should we reconvene
before the board meeting

27:59.077 --> 28:00.211
- to pull files?
- Yeah.

28:00.211 --> 28:01.279
Yeah.

28:05.283 --> 28:06.217
Thank you.

28:24.102 --> 28:26.704
- Is it real, Frank?
- I don't know.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.210
My dad wanted me to take over?

28:33.812 --> 28:36.147
Well, sometimes.

28:37.215 --> 28:39.417
You know that he did. Sometimes.

28:41.119 --> 28:43.188
He made me hate him, then he died.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.461
I feel like he didn't like me.

28:50.829 --> 28:51.963
- No.
- I disappointed him.

28:52.263 --> 28:54.332
No. No. Come on.

28:55.166 --> 29:00.105
We think these grand horror things
at times like these,

29:00.105 --> 29:03.675
these ice shelves are gonna come at us
in the night and take our heads off.

29:03.675 --> 29:04.876
It's not true.

29:07.278 --> 29:10.181
He was an old bastard. And he loved you.

29:11.116 --> 29:12.050
He loved you.

29:16.354 --> 29:18.756
- You think?
- I think so.

29:41.312 --> 29:43.948
If I get them in behind me,
will you follow?

29:45.016 --> 29:47.752
Ken, you've got stuff cooking.

29:49.154 --> 29:50.221
You seem so well.

29:52.390 --> 29:53.591
You really want back in?

30:01.132 --> 30:02.267
Part of me is just like,

30:02.267 --> 30:04.536
"Well, let's just give
the poor orphan what he wants."

30:07.639 --> 30:10.108
Sorry, I don't know what's wrong
with me. That's not good.

30:10.108 --> 30:12.110
No, no, no. I get it, yeah.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.946
I mean, it is interim.

30:15.847 --> 30:16.848
Well...

30:17.649 --> 30:18.850
So long as it is.

30:19.450 --> 30:21.052
What do you mean? What are you thinking?

30:22.520 --> 30:24.889
It's felt good. Us, right?

30:25.290 --> 30:26.958
- Yeah.
- And now, does this...

30:28.193 --> 30:31.262
feel good?
Like, does that feel good? It's...

30:39.170 --> 30:40.705
- Hey. How're you doing?
- Hey.

30:41.973 --> 30:42.907
I don't know.

30:44.375 --> 30:45.410
You?

30:45.710 --> 30:49.247
Well, he wasn't my dad but,
you know, he's...

30:51.549 --> 30:53.284
- It's sad.
- Yeah.

30:54.485 --> 30:56.387
I guess you already picked
the wrong horse.

30:57.088 --> 31:00.024
- You might've picked the dead horse.
- Don't. You'll regret it.

31:00.625 --> 31:02.227
Let me show you some kindness.

31:04.495 --> 31:05.496
Not my thing.

31:06.564 --> 31:09.968
You know, honestly, I guess I'm just...

31:11.236 --> 31:13.238
slowly coming to accept that...

31:14.539 --> 31:16.441
- we killed him.
- Shiv.

31:16.741 --> 31:18.810
No, we did. He died on the plane.

31:19.244 --> 31:22.313
And he wouldn't have been on the plane,
except that we made him get on there,

31:22.313 --> 31:25.316
- so that's just very cool.
- Anything could've happened.

31:25.617 --> 31:28.620
- A million things could've happened.
- I just don't want to fake myself out.

31:29.187 --> 31:31.789
If we had said yes to GoJo, then...

31:32.890 --> 31:35.126
he might've been around
for 20 more years.

31:35.393 --> 31:37.328
So, he could rock his grandkids
to sleep.

31:38.363 --> 31:40.331
As he was evidently so keen to do.

31:41.165 --> 31:42.100
Yeah.

31:44.035 --> 31:46.037
Well, that's fucked now, isn't it? So...

31:57.682 --> 31:58.850
Don't. Just stop.

32:01.819 --> 32:02.754
I'm angry.

32:04.622 --> 32:08.359
My dad died.
And my mom is a fucking disaster.

32:08.359 --> 32:09.694
And my husband is...

32:12.096 --> 32:14.399
And Kerry, and Marcia, and...

32:14.966 --> 32:18.002
It... it feels like
I'm the only one who lost something

32:18.002 --> 32:21.172
that they actually fucking wanted here
and it's not coming back, so...

32:23.441 --> 32:24.375
Yeah.

32:28.980 --> 32:32.283
Siobhan, do you remember when...

32:33.484 --> 32:36.254
we first knew one another?

32:37.989 --> 32:41.359
The first time in France
when I flew to you?

32:43.227 --> 32:45.430
And it was that very difficult time
for you.

32:45.830 --> 32:50.234
And I'd sent you
all those handwritten notes.

32:51.135 --> 32:54.772
And then the first time
that you were wearing that very...

32:55.907 --> 32:58.743
fine silk shirt.

32:59.644 --> 33:03.548
And I put my arm around you. I said...
I kept asking, "Do you like this?"

33:04.482 --> 33:05.483
"Do you like this?"

33:08.119 --> 33:11.222
And you said, eventually,
"l like it all."

33:14.926 --> 33:15.860
Yeah, well...

33:20.264 --> 33:22.967
- That was a while ago, wasn't it?
- Not that long.

33:24.035 --> 33:25.103
No, it was a while back.

33:34.979 --> 33:35.913
I'm sorry.

33:38.583 --> 33:40.752
- Colin does jeans?
- Yeah.

33:40.752 --> 33:43.154
He doesn't know what the fuck
to do with himself. Look at his arms.

33:44.122 --> 33:45.723
He looks like a dog without its person.

33:50.328 --> 33:51.262
Fun.

33:52.196 --> 33:53.398
Colin has a kid?

33:53.998 --> 33:55.333
Shit. Didn't even notice.

33:55.900 --> 33:57.235
- What the fuck now?
- What do we think?

33:57.235 --> 33:59.437
There's a dog...
there's a dog in the house.

34:00.037 --> 34:01.639
Hi. Marcia.

34:02.206 --> 34:05.309
Marcia, so, what's with the...
the "ruff-ruff"?

34:05.309 --> 34:07.945
The Secret Service
are conducting a sweep.

34:08.579 --> 34:10.448
Jeryd Mencken is en route.

34:10.448 --> 34:13.184
I'm not sure
that I want that today actually.

34:13.184 --> 34:14.719
- I don't want to see him.
- Yeah, he asked.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.521
He was a friend of your father's, no?

34:16.521 --> 34:18.589
Come on. They spoke.
But no, it was transactional.

34:19.023 --> 34:22.693
Yeah. Not like all his real friends
from his men's group and choir.

34:22.693 --> 34:24.495
- Come on, Rome. He didn't know him.
- His two best friends.

34:24.495 --> 34:26.130
'What's-his-face" and
"Get-that-fucker-away-from-me."

34:26.130 --> 34:27.331
He called him the spooky embryo.

34:27.331 --> 34:30.034
Yeah, okay. Look. It's just
there's all these fucking ghouls here.

34:30.034 --> 34:31.302
- So, come on.
- I just don't want to see

34:31.302 --> 34:33.004
his smirky, little autocratic face.

34:33.004 --> 34:34.672
Probably going to be president
this time next week.

34:34.672 --> 34:36.641
Okay. Well, I think I have a veto.
My dad just died.

34:36.641 --> 34:39.477
I think I have a counter veto
'cause, weirdly, my dad just died too.

34:40.378 --> 34:44.482
Guys, I think on a business level,
we need to have a relationship.

34:46.050 --> 34:48.085
Yeah. You do? Now, you do?

34:49.287 --> 34:50.421
Yeah, all right.

34:50.421 --> 34:51.989
- Friends.
- God.

34:53.558 --> 34:54.859
- This fucking day.
- Good friends, all.

34:55.893 --> 35:01.032
When a great man passes,
the angels of heaven weep.

35:01.499 --> 35:06.337
But when a giant
of the conservative movement passes...

35:06.337 --> 35:09.607
Oh, God.
Now, we're having a kids' entertainer?

35:09.607 --> 35:11.742
Who the fuck made him
the king of the day?

35:12.443 --> 35:18.049
Logan Roy was such a giant. He was
a man of humility, grace, dignity.

35:18.049 --> 35:21.252
Who died fishing his iPhone
from a clogged toilet.

35:21.252 --> 35:23.855
- In public, he was a great communicator.
- Really?

35:24.288 --> 35:25.990
- A powerful man.
- Man.

35:25.990 --> 35:27.925
So they say. Karl blocked it.

35:29.060 --> 35:30.094
No.

35:30.094 --> 35:32.563
The man lives on Wonder bread
and steak frites.

35:32.563 --> 35:34.398
He hadn't had a shit for 20 years.

35:34.398 --> 35:35.800
He was a man of wisdom.

35:36.133 --> 35:39.871
A man of humility. A man without vanity.

35:40.137 --> 35:42.206
He was a man who wasn't wearing
his compression socks

35:42.206 --> 35:45.376
- so he could look hot for Kerry.
- ...to make the world a better place.

35:45.810 --> 35:49.780
He molded the country
like clay in his hands,

35:49.780 --> 35:52.984
and made it into something beautiful.

35:53.284 --> 35:56.220
- Into the shape of a dick.
- Come on.

35:56.487 --> 35:59.423
He made it stronger. More coherent.

36:00.157 --> 36:03.961
When I think of L.R.,
I think of a great lion of freedom.

36:03.961 --> 36:05.329
Can you believe this shit?

36:05.830 --> 36:07.732
He's trying to make Pop
into a neoconservative.

36:07.732 --> 36:10.134
He wasn't a neocon,
he was a paleo libertarian.

36:10.401 --> 36:12.737
He was practically
an anarcho-capitalist.

36:13.037 --> 36:15.473
Yeah, sure. I mean,
if you like Benny Hill and Sinatra,

36:15.473 --> 36:16.974
does that make you one of those things?

36:17.642 --> 36:18.910
They're trying to body snatch him.

36:18.910 --> 36:22.013
History's being written.
The next 48 hours are crucial.

36:22.513 --> 36:24.782
Godspeed, for surely soon,

36:25.383 --> 36:29.453
Logan Roy will be running rolling news
in heaven.

36:29.854 --> 36:31.055
- Hey.
- How's it going?

36:31.055 --> 36:32.657
- Shiv, I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

36:32.657 --> 36:34.825
- Hey, I'm so sorry, Shiv.
- Hey. Thanks.

36:35.426 --> 36:36.627
- Thank you for coming.
- Hey.

36:36.627 --> 36:37.995
Good of you to be here.

36:37.995 --> 36:43.000
Yeah, I'm so sorry.
My dad was very affected.

36:43.935 --> 36:48.105
Yeah. And so, why is he doing
that with his face, can I ask?

36:48.372 --> 36:50.141
That's just how his face looks
these days.

36:50.575 --> 36:54.612
- Yeah? Frozen into a smile?
- Please. He's... he's sad.

36:54.612 --> 36:56.180
He knew your dad for a long time.

36:56.447 --> 36:58.482
I'm sure... I'm pretty sure
he just fucking winked at me.

36:59.417 --> 37:01.452
- The news world...
- Sandy, it's Kendall.

37:01.452 --> 37:02.453
...is broken.

37:02.820 --> 37:05.156
- What's he doing?
- I mean, I guess,

37:06.290 --> 37:08.025
they were close, Dad and him, so...

37:08.359 --> 37:10.194
Yeah. Plus, he still has a board vote.

37:10.194 --> 37:12.630
But, you know, I guess,
who would you prefer, one of us

37:12.630 --> 37:14.632
or one of the old guard?

37:21.772 --> 37:23.474
- Everything all right?
- Yep.

37:23.874 --> 37:26.344
Dear. Yes.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.680
Look who's crawled out of the woodwork.

37:29.947 --> 37:32.416
I told her not to do this.
I don't understand.

37:32.750 --> 37:36.220
God. She's coming over.
It's so distasteful.

37:36.787 --> 37:38.255
- Hi.
- Hello.

37:38.656 --> 37:40.758
I got your message
but I just want to go...

37:41.659 --> 37:44.595
I just have some things
of mine upstairs that I need.

37:45.062 --> 37:48.032
They're in a bag. Kevin. Melanie.

37:49.333 --> 37:51.035
I just need to go up, so...

37:51.502 --> 37:54.071
- Please. No. Not upstairs.
- Thank you.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.107
I don't want her up.

37:56.407 --> 37:59.343
- Okay. I know...
- Come on. Easy. Easy.

37:59.343 --> 38:02.680
- Don't look, it's too unpleasant.
- Hey. Sorry, what's...

38:02.680 --> 38:05.583
What's going on? You okay?
Is this yours? You okay?

38:05.916 --> 38:07.451
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

38:07.451 --> 38:09.553
- I'm... I'm good.
- Cool? You're good?

38:10.621 --> 38:11.622
Do you need me to help you?

38:12.256 --> 38:13.924
Sorry. I don't know
if I have your private number.

38:13.924 --> 38:14.925
Can you send that to me?

38:16.527 --> 38:18.029
Okay. It's fine.

38:18.529 --> 38:19.930
I got it, I got it, I got it.

38:24.001 --> 38:25.136
Goddammit.

38:25.436 --> 38:28.305
We were talking about getting married,

38:28.305 --> 38:31.909
and he was making arrangements
about us, so could you check?

38:31.909 --> 38:33.411
- Yeah, yeah. And...
- Yeah?

38:33.411 --> 38:35.379
He was going to...
he was going to make a note.

38:35.379 --> 38:38.549
He was going to write his lawyer
or something. Please, can you check?

38:38.549 --> 38:40.418
- Can you check on it?
- I'm going to check on it. I got it.

38:40.418 --> 38:42.019
Do I have your private number?
I think...

38:42.019 --> 38:44.455
- Go ahead, take her out the back, yeah?
- I can get it. I can get it.

38:47.992 --> 38:48.926
Yeah.

38:51.128 --> 38:54.298
God. Here come the waterworks.

38:54.632 --> 38:56.000
Out the back, Billy.

38:58.135 --> 39:00.471
"Take her out the back, Billy."
That's always nice to hear.

39:01.205 --> 39:03.708
Marcia, that was unnecessary, right?

39:04.075 --> 39:07.978
We're calling Kerry a taxi
to the subway so that she can go home

39:08.279 --> 39:09.814
to her little apartment.

39:11.716 --> 39:12.650
Nice.

39:17.321 --> 39:18.255
Jesus.

39:19.824 --> 39:23.527
- How's your friend, Sandy?
- Yeah. "Who are you?"

39:24.562 --> 39:26.997
"Why is this sex party so sad?"

39:28.265 --> 39:29.633
Shiv, should we talk?

39:31.869 --> 39:35.039
Yeah. We... we don't need to...
Nothing needs to change too much.

39:35.406 --> 39:37.708
Like, whatever you're thinking,
you can... you can say.

39:37.708 --> 39:41.846
Fine. We should...
we should definitely talk. Okay.

39:43.981 --> 39:45.082
Hey. Hey, Rome.

39:46.150 --> 39:48.419
- How are you doing?
- Hi. Great. How are you?

39:48.419 --> 39:50.154
Yeah. I'm good. I'm okay. I'm okay.

39:50.154 --> 39:52.857
I just want to say, tell me...
tell me to fuck off

39:52.857 --> 39:56.961
if you like, really, but, you know,
the... the piece of paper situation?

39:58.562 --> 40:00.030
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I heard about it.

40:00.030 --> 40:02.800
And I didn't want to...
I don't want to talk out of turn,

40:02.800 --> 40:06.704
but we both know
that Logan only wanted one person

40:06.704 --> 40:09.073
to take over,
and he just asked you back in.

40:10.107 --> 40:13.277
Look at you. Tommy-wommy.
Tightrope Tommy.

40:13.277 --> 40:16.614
Riding his little subtle cycle
across Niagara Falls?

40:16.614 --> 40:19.784
- Tip-toe Tommy.
- Here to serve. I'm here to serve.

40:22.787 --> 40:27.358
Lip balm, Tom-wom.
Lubing up his lips to kiss my butt.

40:33.197 --> 40:34.698
- Hey.
- Hey, dude.

40:39.537 --> 40:41.272
- That old fucking bastard.
- Yeah.

40:42.940 --> 40:45.309
- Yeah.
- I thought he'd be like my dad.

40:46.143 --> 40:48.078
Ninety-five and just started
suing the neighbor.

40:49.413 --> 40:52.316
- What was it?
- Embolism. Pulmonary.

40:54.251 --> 40:57.021
Because I heard he saw
your Pierce business plan

40:57.021 --> 40:58.022
and choked laughing.

41:03.027 --> 41:04.261
You fucking prick.

41:10.801 --> 41:12.937
Hey. Hey.

41:14.638 --> 41:17.041
Come on. It's all right.

41:22.746 --> 41:23.681
Hey.

41:25.950 --> 41:26.917
So...

41:28.152 --> 41:29.086
Listen.

41:29.787 --> 41:31.488
You going to do the board call
from here?

41:33.257 --> 41:34.191
Here or car.

41:35.793 --> 41:40.531
Because there's...
there's a piece of paper with me on it.

41:41.799 --> 41:43.500
That Dad said it should be me.

41:46.270 --> 41:47.238
Okay.

41:49.206 --> 41:50.975
- Wow.
- Can you swing in for me?

41:51.609 --> 41:53.577
You know me, you know my flaws.

41:55.512 --> 41:56.547
It's short term.

41:57.448 --> 41:59.583
I mean, you're really selling me
right now. I mean...

42:00.651 --> 42:04.188
I guess. You know,
my pubes got a little singed

42:04.188 --> 42:05.522
- the last time I went with you.
- Yeah.

42:05.522 --> 42:06.657
- Remember? Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:07.358 --> 42:10.427
Well, yeah.
That was... that was a different...

42:11.228 --> 42:14.498
different thing.
For my family, I had to back down.

42:15.199 --> 42:17.534
There was no card
he wouldn't play against me.

42:22.373 --> 42:23.507
Do you even fucking like the deal?

42:23.874 --> 42:28.178
Yes. Yes, I do.
Look, the deal has to happen.

42:29.380 --> 42:32.449
We can't live in a haunted house.
I have plans with the sibs.

42:32.850 --> 42:35.352
We'll take news
and maybe fuse with Pierce,

42:35.352 --> 42:39.290
but, you know, it'll be a feather
in my cap to bring in the deal.

42:39.890 --> 42:42.559
And you could bring it home?
Dude. Ken...

42:43.727 --> 42:45.296
Is your fucking head on straight?

42:45.863 --> 42:47.564
I'm twin track. I'm dead but I'm alive.

42:47.831 --> 42:50.134
Yeah? Dive into work?

42:51.268 --> 42:54.972
Dude, what are we going to do?
Sit in the dark and drink Laphroaig?

42:57.574 --> 43:01.745
And what's in it for me, Ken?

43:04.515 --> 43:07.384
I don't know, man. Maybe do a solid

43:07.384 --> 43:09.420
for your oldest pal
the day after his dad died.

43:10.688 --> 43:11.588
How about that?

43:12.957 --> 43:17.027
- What do you think of the apartment?
- It's very pleasant.

43:17.895 --> 43:20.864
We need to check all the walls
and see if they're structural.

43:20.864 --> 43:23.534
I'd actually like to make this,
you know, bigger.

43:24.068 --> 43:27.838
Willa's mom. God love her.
Her plate is groaning.

43:28.439 --> 43:31.575
Hey, so listen. I think Stewy
would swing behind one of us.

43:32.376 --> 43:34.144
Okay. Does she know she can go back?

43:34.445 --> 43:36.981
- And she dropped the grapes.
- Yeah.

43:36.981 --> 43:38.649
Her boat really came in, didn't it?

43:38.983 --> 43:40.718
This is turning
into the grand tour for her.

43:40.718 --> 43:43.354
I guess the agenda for me is do we...

43:44.288 --> 43:47.358
You know, do we agree
to flying to Matsson?

43:47.358 --> 43:48.892
You know that Connor's moving in, yeah?

43:49.193 --> 43:52.363
- Okay. What?
- Well, Marcia gets it but she kinda...

43:52.663 --> 43:56.367
- She... she sort of sold it to me.
- She did? Let's all move in.

43:56.767 --> 43:59.403
<i>Grow old together, share a bed
like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.</i>

43:59.403 --> 44:02.673
- We've got, like, ten till board time.
- Yeah, you've spoken to Mom yet?

44:03.874 --> 44:06.643
No. Swapped messages.
Shiv, should...

44:06.643 --> 44:09.913
- Can we... can we talk?
- Peter Munion was flying to Spain,

44:09.913 --> 44:12.516
and he tried to reroute
to come directly here

44:12.516 --> 44:15.185
because he wanted to be with us
at this difficult time.

44:15.185 --> 44:16.854
- Man.
- He sent a message saying,

44:17.154 --> 44:20.791
"It's a rum situation,"
and, "one in the eye for all of us,"

44:20.791 --> 44:22.693
- and also...
- Can you stop ignoring me?

44:22.693 --> 44:25.729
Please, for fuck's sake.
Come on, please.

44:26.597 --> 44:27.898
Let's talk about it.

44:29.500 --> 44:32.136
We got somewhere. Us.
We've got somewhere.

44:32.436 --> 44:35.739
Yeah? Let's talk about it.
I don't even care what happens,

44:35.739 --> 44:38.108
but let's not just give it
to the fucking keystone fucks

44:38.108 --> 44:39.209
because we didn't talk.

44:40.711 --> 44:41.645
Con.

44:42.446 --> 44:43.914
- Really?
- Do you mind?

44:45.983 --> 44:48.886
<i>- Sorry, man.
- Mi casa es su casa.</i>

44:56.794 --> 44:58.629
So, what do you think?

44:59.129 --> 45:02.232
You have an issue with me because...

45:03.367 --> 45:04.334
Yeah.

45:05.469 --> 45:06.470
That's fine.

45:07.971 --> 45:14.144
But I'd like it to be one of us.
And yeah, Dad said so.

45:14.144 --> 45:16.880
Okay. Well, let's discuss
but can you please just stop jonesing?

45:16.880 --> 45:18.916
You're walking around the wake
with a fucking hard-on.

45:18.916 --> 45:23.954
I'm not. I'm... All I am suggesting
is that I swing it for us,

45:23.954 --> 45:28.292
and then we move ahead, us three.
Pierce, ATN, everything.

45:28.292 --> 45:30.828
Okay, good. Great.
Well, I have some thoughts.

45:31.095 --> 45:33.430
Yeah. I guess I have some thoughts too.

45:34.698 --> 45:40.104
- You're not pulling for Gerr-bear?
- What, me? Hell no. No, I'm... I'm done

45:40.904 --> 45:46.844
helping old ladies cross the street.
But I do wonder about...

45:48.545 --> 45:49.646
- About me?
- Yeah.

45:49.646 --> 45:50.647
Yeah.

45:51.582 --> 45:53.984
- Okay.
- I think it needs to be me too.

45:55.953 --> 45:58.188
- Okay.
- Yeah. We're doing what we do...

45:59.556 --> 46:02.126
- together.
- Well, ultimately, that's how I want it.

46:03.260 --> 46:05.295
Man, come on. You're jerking
over a piece of paper

46:05.295 --> 46:07.431
that he scribbled your fucking name on.

46:08.499 --> 46:11.802
There is an argument
that you're the worst of both worlds.

46:11.802 --> 46:13.036
Different, but the same.

46:13.036 --> 46:17.941
That plays, it does, with the board.
Same old but with a vibey new banner.

46:18.275 --> 46:20.477
COO is on the draft plan, right? Like...

46:21.011 --> 46:21.979
- Right?
- Yeah.

46:22.346 --> 46:26.817
I'm the COO. And I know Matsson.
And I was very close with Dad.

46:26.817 --> 46:29.419
We had a number of communications
that you were aware of

46:29.753 --> 46:34.158
and some that, honestly,
now's not the time, but you were not.

46:34.158 --> 46:38.695
And yeah, I just think
we were close and honestly, Ken,

46:38.962 --> 46:43.333
it doesn't feel good, right?
For it to be just you.

46:43.667 --> 46:47.104
- Yeah.
- So, them's my words.

46:51.575 --> 46:52.509
I see that.

46:54.344 --> 46:55.746
Yeah. I see that, bro.

46:56.513 --> 46:57.581
- You do?
- Yeah.

46:58.315 --> 47:01.051
I mean, Rome,
it doesn't have to be just me.

47:02.085 --> 47:03.620
I'm down. It makes sense.

47:04.788 --> 47:08.825
M'kay. And what about me?

47:10.060 --> 47:14.765
Honestly, I just worry...
It looks like special pleading.

47:16.166 --> 47:19.636
Like, it's the COO's.
It's in the draft plan.

47:20.170 --> 47:21.471
I'm on the piece of paper.

47:22.239 --> 47:27.110
It... it needs to look fucking dry
and clean and tough.

47:27.110 --> 47:31.448
And I don't? Yeah? I look too teary-eyed
and mascara-streaked,

47:31.448 --> 47:32.950
and like I might fucking faint?

47:33.383 --> 47:35.686
- It's clean enough.
- Shiv, it's not... it's not...

47:36.320 --> 47:39.489
Really, I don't think it works.

47:40.857 --> 47:44.261
You actually don't have experience.
It starts to look flaky.

47:44.995 --> 47:48.765
- I did the strategic review.
- That was "Daddy make work."

47:50.300 --> 47:53.737
And besides,
I think two is cool but three is...

47:54.204 --> 47:57.107
- Like, three is...
- Three is a bit wonky.

48:00.877 --> 48:03.880
I mean, two is fucking,

48:03.880 --> 48:07.451
and three
is like some weird orgy for hippies.

48:07.818 --> 48:10.053
I can't see the board going for three.

48:16.627 --> 48:18.228
Well, I need to wet my beak.

48:19.129 --> 48:20.397
We'd only be fronting it.

48:20.397 --> 48:22.366
I don't need to be front facing,
and it's not about ego.

48:22.366 --> 48:27.004
- It's the threebie. It's the team.
- Yeah, you're inside everything.

48:27.004 --> 48:30.073
Okay? This is like...
I'm not trying to fuck anyone, okay?

48:30.574 --> 48:32.643
This is just to sell,
and yesterday was...

48:33.710 --> 48:36.980
Come on. Like, yesterday was fucking...
That was real. And I think we're...

48:38.448 --> 48:41.985
I feel really good about this.
This is... I think this is good.

48:43.086 --> 48:45.689
- I need to be across everything.
- Everything. Yeah.

48:45.956 --> 48:48.859
Yeah. It's a holding position.
It's holding.

48:49.693 --> 48:52.396
We'll do the deal.
Spin ATN, fold in Pierce.

48:52.696 --> 48:54.331
Six months, eight months.

48:55.098 --> 48:56.233
And that's all equal?

48:56.700 --> 48:58.502
- Yeah.
- Equal as fuck, to the gram.

48:59.569 --> 49:01.405
'Cause you guys fuck me
on this, and it's...

49:01.705 --> 49:02.639
No.

49:07.344 --> 49:09.780
This is a Dad promise. On yesterday.

49:11.682 --> 49:13.650
- Yeah. On yesterday.
- On yesterday.

49:14.718 --> 49:15.786
Not going to fuck you.

49:19.723 --> 49:20.891
You guys want to talk?

49:21.458 --> 49:22.559
- Ready?
- Yeah.

49:23.894 --> 49:24.828
Okay.

49:26.897 --> 49:27.831
Okay?

49:28.565 --> 49:29.499
Yeah?

49:36.139 --> 49:37.074
I think...

49:38.675 --> 49:41.478
pre-board, we were just hoping
it would be just us.

49:41.478 --> 49:42.713
No. This is a good group.

49:44.181 --> 49:46.650
I'm just not sure
it's appropriate for this discussion.

49:46.650 --> 49:48.985
Well, if you're uncomfortable,
Frank, you can fuck off.

49:49.553 --> 49:52.389
This is a lovely gang
of pals having a chat. Okay?

49:53.857 --> 49:57.694
Look, it's simple.
COOs are on the draft emergency plan.

49:57.694 --> 50:01.765
It looks perverse not to honor that, and
it looks pointed for it not to be us.

50:02.466 --> 50:03.533
Me and Roman step up.

50:05.001 --> 50:07.804
Well, when was the last time
you spoke with your dad?

50:08.305 --> 50:10.841
- Like, 48 hours ago.
- And how'd that go?

50:13.210 --> 50:14.578
- It went well.
- Well?

50:14.845 --> 50:16.980
Ken, the DOJ's all wrapped up

50:17.481 --> 50:21.451
and everything you said
about Logan amounted to nothing.

50:21.451 --> 50:22.753
You're damaged goods.

50:22.753 --> 50:26.289
Whereas I shepherded
in a lot of cultural change.

50:26.289 --> 50:28.925
I think we all know
that Dad had soured on Gerri.

50:28.925 --> 50:31.128
I don't think there's anything
on paper to that effect.

50:34.631 --> 50:35.766
But I'm not going to push it.

50:36.233 --> 50:37.567
We're obviously the people

50:37.567 --> 50:39.536
to take over for Dad.
We were closest to him.

50:39.536 --> 50:41.538
I think the board could have concerns.

50:41.538 --> 50:43.740
Well, Kendall's name
is on a piece of paper.

50:44.040 --> 50:45.208
Logan said it should be Kendall.

50:45.609 --> 50:47.744
- But when?
- A few times.

50:48.545 --> 50:52.949
You've lost Logan.
And for his faults, he was the founder.

50:53.784 --> 50:54.751
Ken and Roman.

50:55.485 --> 50:57.954
I think a Roy at Royco works.

50:58.422 --> 51:01.324
- It's not for long.
- So you can puppet master them.

51:01.324 --> 51:03.360
- Who? Me, Frank?
- Get the fuck outta here.

51:03.693 --> 51:04.628
Come on.

51:05.262 --> 51:08.498
There will be the renegotiation
with Matsson.

51:08.498 --> 51:11.668
I want to do the deal and get out.
We've got our own ideas.

51:11.668 --> 51:14.237
With ATN refreshed,
there's a shape for things.

51:14.237 --> 51:15.972
- For us, we have things cooking.
- Yeah.

51:15.972 --> 51:18.742
I mean, we know that teh board
is very excited about the deal.

51:18.742 --> 51:20.010
So are we, it's a good deal.

51:20.010 --> 51:21.578
- It is a good deal.
- Yeah.

51:28.151 --> 51:29.653
History is happening.

51:30.454 --> 51:32.055
- Can you smell it?
- Sure.

51:32.389 --> 51:34.191
Roses and the rotting corpses.

51:34.758 --> 51:37.227
Okay. Okay, it's done.

51:37.561 --> 51:39.262
It's done. They voted it through.

51:39.262 --> 51:40.497
Ken and Rome?

51:40.497 --> 51:42.632
Ken and Rome step up from COO.

51:43.166 --> 51:45.335
Let's draft it, Hugo, right now.

51:45.335 --> 51:47.471
- Ken and Rome. All right!
- And I'll reply to...

51:50.073 --> 51:51.708
Long live the king!

51:56.213 --> 52:00.851
Long live the king!
Long live the king! And the other king.

52:05.322 --> 52:06.256
Hi.

52:07.757 --> 52:11.127
- Everything well?
- Yeah. All great. All good.

52:11.528 --> 52:12.462
Great.

52:16.800 --> 52:18.435
Yeah. Shut the fuck up

52:18.435 --> 52:20.136
and stop laughing.
It's not a comedy night.

52:21.805 --> 52:22.772
God.

52:24.107 --> 52:25.909
Shoot.

52:25.909 --> 52:28.311
- Hey. Hey, honey.
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

52:28.311 --> 52:29.412
I'm fine. I'm fine.

52:29.946 --> 52:31.147
Don't fucking touch me.

52:32.983 --> 52:35.285
Stop... stop smiling!

52:39.990 --> 52:41.224
No one comes in here.

52:44.227 --> 52:47.898
So, you're running the company. Congratulations.

52:47.898 --> 52:50.333
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.
Great day. Great week.

53:01.978 --> 53:03.480
Did you know he did Sudoku?

53:07.384 --> 53:12.589
Yeah. Yeah, I guess he did them.
I think I... I think I knew that.

53:21.498 --> 53:23.266
Jesus fucking Christ.

53:25.602 --> 53:27.170
- You guys okay? Yeah?
- Yeah.

53:27.170 --> 53:28.305
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

53:28.305 --> 53:30.273
Okay, yeah. I'm sorry that we have to,

53:31.107 --> 53:34.778
you know, but we are putting together
the statement announcing you and...

53:35.879 --> 53:37.647
We'll go through
all the biographical details

53:37.647 --> 53:41.184
with your offices, and yeah,
just wanted to check in on Comms and PR.

53:41.184 --> 53:44.754
And there's also a lot
of quite difficult decisions, so...

53:44.754 --> 53:49.092
Yes. I guess what we wanted
to say from a Comms point of view,

53:49.092 --> 53:50.927
and listen, this is strictly Comms,

53:51.294 --> 53:54.164
but the markets
are going to open on Monday.

53:54.731 --> 54:01.805
And there are a number of ways
to solidify your guys' position. Okay?

54:01.805 --> 54:03.540
When Logan was with us,

54:03.807 --> 54:06.476
we did everything we could
to burnish his reputation.

54:06.476 --> 54:09.379
Now, you're taking over,
so we want to do everything we can

54:09.379 --> 54:11.181
to burnish your reputations.

54:11.481 --> 54:15.251
Yeah. I guess there are two ways to go.
They're sort of...

54:16.419 --> 54:20.490
Operation Embalmed Lenin
or there's another way.

54:20.924 --> 54:22.826
Yeah, for the first option,
we, you know,

54:23.126 --> 54:25.895
just put together a nice package
of photos with you and your dad.

54:26.563 --> 54:29.899
You're a safe pair of hands,
mention the piece of paper.

54:30.567 --> 54:32.869
And you're going to follow
what Logan Roy did to the letter.

54:33.269 --> 54:38.675
Or there's a more complex,
more fresh start.

54:39.743 --> 54:40.677
Go on.

54:40.677 --> 54:44.014
And this is, again,
just a PR perspective, yeah?

54:44.781 --> 54:47.050
There's going to be an issue
about your competence.

54:47.317 --> 54:49.886
And so, maybe, if we stress,
for example,

54:50.220 --> 54:53.823
how involved
you've already been previously.

54:54.190 --> 54:56.192
So, toughest version,

54:56.860 --> 55:02.399
we say that he was
losing his focus towards the end.

55:02.399 --> 55:05.869
Okay. So, it's Operation Shit-On-Dad.

55:05.869 --> 55:07.070
- No.
- Yeah.

55:07.070 --> 55:08.238
- No.
- Yes, it is.

55:08.238 --> 55:10.907
- I think the piece of paper is strong.
- Okay.

55:12.108 --> 55:13.943
You really think
that people are going to buy

55:13.943 --> 55:15.812
that Dad was a fucking puppet?

55:15.812 --> 55:20.150
- It's just an option, Roman.
- Logan Roy was a great man.

55:21.017 --> 55:26.122
However, lately, the people around him
have been making the big decisions.

55:26.489 --> 55:30.827
His kids have been pulling the strings.
I mean, we can go as far as you like.

55:33.963 --> 55:40.236
I wouldn't, but it is our job
to say that we could go to Connor's mom.

55:40.570 --> 55:43.306
Physical and verbal abuse.
The Kerry situation.

55:43.306 --> 55:47.777
Okay. Well. That'... All right.
Okay? Yeah, I... I... I do have...

55:48.611 --> 55:52.649
certain feelings of queasiness about,
I guess,

55:52.649 --> 55:56.219
shitting on our dad while he's still up
at Frank E. Campbell's.

55:59.322 --> 56:03.793
Yeah. Right now, I would say
considering our dad has just died,

56:04.094 --> 56:05.862
we should maybe not shit on Dad.

56:05.862 --> 56:08.031
Yeah. Thanks, Karolina.

56:08.732 --> 56:09.999
You too, fuckface. But...

56:11.267 --> 56:13.803
maybe don't bring us
this disgusting shit ever again. Okay?

56:13.803 --> 56:15.205
- Sure.
- Thanks, anyway.

56:15.205 --> 56:16.973
- Understood. Understood.
- Sorry.

56:16.973 --> 56:18.007
- Thanks, Roman.
- Thanks, Hugo.

56:18.007 --> 56:19.242
Yep. Apologies.

57:10.627 --> 57:11.561
Hey, Hugo.

57:14.898 --> 57:16.266
You know the stuff?

57:17.100 --> 57:18.067
What stuff?

57:18.902 --> 57:20.036
The bad Dad stuff.

57:21.771 --> 57:22.772
Yeah.

57:22.772 --> 57:25.975
It's what he would do.
He'd want this for the firm.

57:26.843 --> 57:31.548
- Right. Okay.
- So, action that. But soft, no prints.

57:32.682 --> 57:39.122
Right. I mean, I don't want to...
I'm a little concerned of freelance.

57:39.455 --> 57:43.426
Can I get a sign off
from Karolina and Roman?

57:43.426 --> 57:48.464
No, pal. No. Down-low. Just get on it.

57:51.935 --> 57:54.337
Unless you want me
to pull out the strap-on.
