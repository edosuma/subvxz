Try to put your minds at ease.

00:53.153 --> 00:57.283
Just try to stay away from the windows
and the doors, if you would.

00:57.357 --> 00:59.655
Do we have to ask you
if we can use the bathroom?

00:59.726 --> 01:01.990
I feel like I'm a prisoner
in my own home.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.862
Ma'am, I apologize for the imposition,
but my job is to protect you.

01:05.932 --> 01:09.459
As of this evening, the FBI's
top priority is keeping you safe.

01:09.536 --> 01:12.369
For how long?
A week, a month? Then what?

01:13.506 --> 01:16.373
Jim, don't do this, please.

01:16.443 --> 01:18.377
You don't have to testify.

01:18.445 --> 01:22.142
It's not worth it. These people have
a long reach. They're powerful.

01:22.215 --> 01:24.274
I have to do this.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.612
I'm going to bed.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.555

Yes, sir.

- It's shaping up to be
a rougher morning.

05:04.336 --> 05:06.270
Follow me.

05:08.874 --> 05:11.843
There's fingerprints everywhere, but
as they all belong to the deceased...

05:11.911 --> 05:13.845
and his wife,
they don't help us.

05:13.913 --> 05:15.847
- This is where the body was found?
- Yeah.

05:15.915 --> 05:17.849
What can you tell us about him?

05:17.917 --> 05:23.514
Dr. James Scobie, age 44,
R&D biochemist with Morley Tobacco.

05:23.589 --> 05:26.752
If he were alive
as of 26 minutes ago,

05:26.826 --> 05:31.058
he'd be giving testimony
against his former employer
before a federal grand jury.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.963
Testimony concerning what?

05:34.033 --> 05:36.126
Not even his wife or his lawyer
know the specifics.

05:36.202 --> 05:38.670
Only that it concerns research
that he was involved in.

05:38.738 --> 05:41.229
Potentially extremely
damaging to Morley.

05:41.307 --> 05:44.140
Enough so that Scobie
received death threats.

05:45.811 --> 05:48.405
Given the high profile
nature of the case,

05:48.481 --> 05:53.214
the director charged me
with insuring Dr. Scobie's protection.

05:54.754 --> 05:58.417
- And you think that someone
made good on these threats?
- I do.

05:58.491 --> 06:01.824
Though we've yet to determine
how someone got in here or...

06:03.162 --> 06:05.494
what killed him.

06:06.732 --> 06:08.597
[Groans]

06:08.667 --> 06:11.227
You can't blow a whistle
with a mouth like that.

06:11.303 --> 06:15.239
It's almost as if his flesh
has been stripped or eaten away.

06:16.575 --> 06:19.066
I mean, an assailant
could have thrown acid on him.

06:19.145 --> 06:23.081
Well, if it was acid in the face,
he would have screamed bloody murder.

06:23.149 --> 06:25.549
Well, we're looking
at all possibilities, Agent.

06:25.618 --> 06:27.848
We need answers.
We don't have a lot of time.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.686
And we're going up against one of
the biggest corporations in America.

06:31.757 --> 06:35.887
The director instructed me that he wants
this case closed as swiftly as possible.

06:35.961 --> 06:37.929
I trust I can count
on your help.

06:40.466 --> 06:44.732
All right, I want you
to perform the autopsy.
The body's in the county morgue.

06:44.804 --> 06:46.738
- I'll get right on it.
- Thank you.

06:51.677 --> 06:53.611
- Huh.
- What?

06:53.679 --> 06:57.308
There's no ashtrays.
Dr. Scobie and his wife don't smoke?

06:57.383 --> 06:59.317
Not that I witnessed.

06:59.385 --> 07:01.512
Tobacco employee
that doesn't smoke.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.215
Isn't that kind of like
a GM executive who drives a Ford?

07:04.290 --> 07:07.487
If this was a hit,
it seems unnecessarily high profile.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.755
It kind of draws attention
to itself, don't you think?

07:09.829 --> 07:13.663
That could be the point...
to intimidate potential witnesses.

07:13.732 --> 07:16.132
Scobie had a supervisor at Morley...
a Dr. Peter Voss.

07:16.202 --> 07:18.966
- I wanna talk to him.
- You mind if I tag along?

07:19.038 --> 07:21.302
- No.
- [Man] Sir?

07:48.200 --> 07:50.191
[Skinner]
We're here to see Dr. Voss.

07:50.269 --> 07:52.362
Do you have an appointment?

07:56.242 --> 07:58.938
Do you have an appointment?

08:01.013 --> 08:03.641
Maybe you missed this
the first time around.

08:03.716 --> 08:05.775
Gentlemen, I can help you.

08:08.087 --> 08:11.386
Daniel Brimley, head
of corporate security. A pleasure.

08:11.457 --> 08:13.823
Nice to meet you.

08:13.893 --> 08:17.624
- You're here concerning
Dr. Scobie's death, I take it?
- We are.

08:17.696 --> 08:22.224
We were all extremely sorry
to hear about it. Jim has a lot
of friends in this building.

08:22.301 --> 08:26.237
Really? No hard feelings that
he was about to turn federal
witness against your company?

08:26.305 --> 08:28.466
Nobody was happy about
Jim's decision,

08:28.540 --> 08:31.236
but the timing of his death
couldn't have been worse.

08:31.310 --> 08:34.073
So you have no problem
with us speaking to Dr. Voss?

08:34.145 --> 08:37.172
Absolutely not.
Whatever we can do to help. Please.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.919
Could you, um...

08:45.991 --> 08:51.224
[Clears Throat]
Could you give my sincerest
condolences toJim's wifeJoan?

08:51.297 --> 08:53.231
How is she?

08:53.299 --> 08:57.235
I'm sure she'll take comfort
in fnding out why her husband died.

08:57.303 --> 09:02.002
Dr. Voss, can you enlighten us
as to what Dr. Scobie intended
to tell the grand jury?

09:02.074 --> 09:04.133
We know it had to do with
company research.

09:04.209 --> 09:06.370
I'm sorry.
Dr. Voss would be in violation...

09:06.445 --> 09:09.778
of his employment confidentiality clause
in answering that question.

09:09.848 --> 09:13.511
- Dr. Scobie was your friend?
- Yeah, for 14 years.

09:13.585 --> 09:16.110
And yet you demoted him
five weeks ago.

09:16.188 --> 09:19.419
You took him off a particular project.
Can you tell us why that happened?

09:19.491 --> 09:22.289
As before, Dr. Voss
would be in violation...

09:22.361 --> 09:26.263
of his confdentiality clause
in answering questions regarding
the nature of his work...

09:26.332 --> 09:28.425
here at Morley.

09:28.500 --> 09:31.901
I'm sure you understand
our cooperation cannot extend itself
to revealing corporate secrets.

09:31.971 --> 09:35.168
I'm not sensing any cooperation
whatsoever.

09:35.240 --> 09:38.403
In fact, I'm one more nonanswer
away from getting...

09:38.477 --> 09:41.310
a federal warrant and searching
this entire building.

09:41.380 --> 09:44.110
- Then this meeting is over. Dr. Voss.
- Dr. Voss.

09:45.684 --> 09:48.118
Can you tell me
what that is?

09:53.625 --> 09:58.324
- It's a tobacco beetle. Why?
- I found it atJim Scobie's house.

09:58.397 --> 10:01.560
Well, you'll find a lot of these
around here. They're everywhere.

10:01.633 --> 10:04.363
There's probably a dozen
in the grill of your car right now.

10:04.436 --> 10:07.599
May I ask where
you're going with this, Agent?

10:07.673 --> 10:09.607
I'm sorry. I can't.

10:09.675 --> 10:12.405
Answering that question
would violate FBI confidentiality...

10:12.478 --> 10:15.242
due to the sensitive nature
of our investigation.

Me and Dr. Scobie
had an arrangement, as you know.

11:16.207 --> 11:19.301
So I figured, uh,
Dr. Scobie not bein' around,

11:19.377 --> 11:23.814
that my arrangement with him...
slides on over to you.

to stay away from their houses.

- Too bad about Dr. Scobie.

12:01.186 --> 12:05.350
- Yeah.
- I bet people are wondering how he died.

12:05.423 --> 12:09.382
I've been working my own
theory up in the old noggin.

12:10.628 --> 12:12.789
I'd be happy to share it
with you someday.

leave now.

- What have you found?

12:48.266 --> 12:51.064
Well, the tissue damage
on Dr. Scobie's mouth extends...

12:51.135 --> 12:54.400
all the way down his trachea
into his lungs.

12:54.472 --> 12:56.963
His alveoli looked
like corned beef.

12:57.041 --> 12:59.942
What about this being the result
of some sort of corrosive agent?

13:00.011 --> 13:03.708
No, that's not the case.
There's no acids present, no caustics.

13:03.781 --> 13:07.512
This damage isn't the result
of any kind of chemical reaction.

13:07.585 --> 13:11.316
His airways have more or less
just been reamed out.

to transfer oxygen...

to the bloodstream.

13:27.372 --> 13:30.034
however it was accomplished,
someone did do this to him.

Well, not necessarily. There weren't
any signs of struggle in the room.

- Where are you going with this?

Well, that this isn't a homicide.
You examined the body, Scully.

13:40.418 --> 13:43.046

- It's a tobacco beetle.

like that, Mulder.

Killer bugs? This is what
I'm supposed to tell the director?

13:56.467 --> 13:59.630
I don't know, but judging
from Dr. Voss's reaction to this,

13:59.704 --> 14:01.695
I think it's the thing
we should investigate.

Well, judging from the condition
of the body,

16:18.541 --> 16:21.567
I'd say that he died
in the same manner as Dr. Scobie.

ThatJim Scobie wasn't murdered.
Neither was this man.

We didn't find any insects
in Dr. Scobie's bathroom.

17:01.217 --> 17:03.685
But there was an open window
through which they could have escaped.

17:03.753 --> 17:07.951
It's a long shot, Mulder, but it could
be some form of contagious agent,

17:08.022 --> 17:11.288

19:31.367 --> 19:33.301
Anything?

19:33.369 --> 19:37.100
Two deaths in less than 24 hours
and we've yet to come up with an answer.

19:37.172 --> 19:40.335
And the only thing I have to go on
medically at this point is Mulder's bug.

19:42.544 --> 19:45.945
You know, I know an entomologist
at UNC Willmington... Dr. Libby Nance.

19:46.015 --> 19:48.279
Good. Talk to her.

19:48.350 --> 19:50.284
Where you going?

19:50.352 --> 19:53.549
To see about something else
that's been bugging me.

20:10.506 --> 20:12.440
- Mrs. Voss?
- Yes?

20:12.508 --> 20:14.999
Fox Mulder.
Is your husband home?

20:15.077 --> 20:18.308
- It's okay, honey.
It'll just be a minute.
- Sure thing.

20:26.188 --> 20:28.679
I really shouldn't be talking
to you without our lawyers.

20:28.757 --> 20:31.419
I understand your reluctance
to talk, sir.

20:31.493 --> 20:34.291
You have a nice family,
a lot to lose.

20:34.363 --> 20:36.831
What do you want, Agent Mulder?

20:36.899 --> 20:39.959
There's been another victim...
Thomas Gastall.

20:40.035 --> 20:42.469
Died exactly the same way
Scobie did.

20:44.940 --> 20:47.636
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:47.710 --> 20:49.701
But what's that
got to do with me?

20:49.778 --> 20:53.236
Well, we found these
all over him.

20:54.750 --> 20:57.480
I believe that that's
what killed both men.

20:58.954 --> 21:02.355
Tobacco beetle. It's an herbivore.
It eats tobacco.

21:02.424 --> 21:04.949
- Hence its name.
- I understand that,

21:05.027 --> 21:07.325
but... maybe these don't.

21:07.396 --> 21:10.388
- I'm not really required
to talk to you, am I?
- No.

21:10.466 --> 21:13.993
But why are you hiding
behind your lawyers, Doctor?

21:14.069 --> 21:16.765
How many people have to die
before you do the right thing?

21:34.823 --> 21:37.155
- [Phone Ringing]
- I'll get it!

21:39.261 --> 21:41.957
- Hello?
- [Brimley] What did he want?

21:46.135 --> 21:49.502
- Are you spying on me?
- I'm not spying on you, Peter.

21:49.571 --> 21:52.942
I'm looking out for you.
What did he want?

21:55.044 --> 21:57.979
There's been another death...
downtown.

21:58.047 --> 22:00.709
- How did it happen?
- I don't know. I don't know.

22:00.783 --> 22:04.219
This has gone on long enough.
We should come forward. I should.

22:04.286 --> 22:07.050
Do you hear
what you're saying, Peter?

22:07.122 --> 22:11.024
Now, I want you to just
take a moment.

22:11.093 --> 22:14.028
I want you to think about
what really matters to you.

22:15.164 --> 22:17.962
Now tell me where
I can find Darryl Weaver.

22:18.033 --> 22:22.299
- Why?
- This was my mistake. I'll clean it up.

22:24.006 --> 22:26.941
- I don't know where he is.
- [Line Disconnects]

22:31.146 --> 22:33.410
[Woman]
This doesn't make sense.

22:33.482 --> 22:36.076
What doesn't make sense?

22:36.151 --> 22:40.781
Well, it's a Lasioderma serricorne...
a tobacco beetle.

22:40.856 --> 22:44.849
Only I've never seen one
exactly like this.

22:44.927 --> 22:47.691
Hmm. What are the differences?

22:47.763 --> 22:50.630
Physical differences.

22:50.699 --> 22:52.633
Minor, but definitely notable.

22:52.701 --> 22:55.033
Deviations in the mandibles,
the antennae,

22:55.104 --> 22:57.698
the body segmentation.

22:57.773 --> 23:02.107
What if such deviations
arose from genetic engineering?

23:02.177 --> 23:04.873
- Engineering the bugs themselves?
- No.

23:04.947 --> 23:08.815
I was actually thinking about
another possibility... transgenomics.

23:08.884 --> 23:13.014
- Which is?
- It's a form of DNA manipulation...

23:13.088 --> 23:15.818
alterations made
on the genetic level.

23:15.891 --> 23:18.917
It is pretty widely known that tobacco
companies have been pouring money...

23:18.994 --> 23:21.360
into that kind of research.

23:21.430 --> 23:23.898
Changing the tobacco plant itself
in order to make it heartier,

23:23.966 --> 23:27.925
give it less nicotine,
more nicotine,

23:28.003 --> 23:30.198
make it naturally
menthol flavored.

23:30.272 --> 23:33.969
- You name it.
- A form of what... super tobacco?

23:34.043 --> 23:37.809
Which possibly could have
created super bugs.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.939
I guess the real question is,

23:40.015 --> 23:42.483
could they have become
dangerous to humans?

23:45.854 --> 23:47.788
Mr. Weaver!

You're the one with the PhD.

24:04.506 --> 24:07.100
I'm just a big old guinea pig.

24:21.790 --> 24:23.724
Uh, listen.

24:24.793 --> 24:27.353
Um, you have to leave town.

24:28.430 --> 24:31.627

this particular brand,

25:26.488 --> 25:29.616
it doesn't, uh,
do anyone else any favors,

25:32.361 --> 25:34.921

Toodles.

25:53.749 --> 25:55.683
No, you... you don't understand.

25:55.751 --> 25:59.118
Morley is a multibillion dollar
global corporation.

25:59.188 --> 26:02.521
You think they're gonna let you endanger
that, huh? They'll kill you first.

26:02.591 --> 26:06.493
Well, it sounds like
a Darryl Weaver problem to me.

26:06.562 --> 26:08.496
Yeah, uh...

26:40.796 --> 26:42.730
What am I looking at?

26:42.798 --> 26:46.029
[Scully]
Thomas Gastall's left lung and bronchus.

26:46.101 --> 26:49.832
Well, I guess that explains
where the beetles came from.

26:51.473 --> 26:53.407
[Footsteps Approaching]

26:55.210 --> 26:57.178
Hey, Mulder.
Where have you been?

26:57.246 --> 27:00.738
Talking to lawyers over atJustice
tryin' to get a look at Morley's files.

27:00.816 --> 27:03.216
Well, take a look at this.

27:06.722 --> 27:10.385
They're the larval stage
of the tobacco beetle, Mulder.

27:10.459 --> 27:14.759
And somehow they have ended up
nesting in Thomas Gastall's lungs.

27:14.830 --> 27:20.132
But what doesn't make any sense
is why Scobie's lungs didn't
show this same condition.

27:20.202 --> 27:23.763
The larvae must pupate
inside the lungs,

27:23.839 --> 27:28.037
and then once they mature into beetles,
exit the body en masse.

27:28.110 --> 27:31.568
- That explains the condition
of the face and throat.
- [Coughs]

27:31.647 --> 27:34.081
Only how did they get into
the lungs to begin with?

27:34.149 --> 27:36.617
[Coughing Continues]

27:43.292 --> 27:45.726
Mulder?

27:59.805 --> 28:02.672
[Suction Whirring]

28:37.009 --> 28:38.943
How is he?

28:39.011 --> 28:43.778
They're using a deep suction
technique that's been designed
for asthma and cystic fibrosis.

28:43.849 --> 28:47.182
And so far, we're having some luck
at clearing his lungs.

28:47.252 --> 28:51.120
- But?
- For every one of those things
that are in his lung tissue,

28:51.189 --> 28:55.216
there may be a dozen eggs
that have yet to be hatched.

28:55.293 --> 28:58.387
- Eggs?
- His pulmonary tissue
is riddled with them.

28:58.463 --> 29:00.795
And they're going to hatch.
It's just, uh,

29:00.866 --> 29:03.198
we're buying time.

29:03.268 --> 29:06.567
How did this happen? These eggs,
how'd they get into his lungs?

29:06.638 --> 29:08.572
I'm thinking he inhaled them.

29:08.640 --> 29:13.600
Well, the tobacco beetle
lives out its life cycle on
or around the tobacco plant.

29:13.679 --> 29:15.613
That's where it lays its eggs.

29:15.681 --> 29:18.673
If those genetically-altered beetles
that we found did that,

29:18.750 --> 29:22.015
then maybe the eggs survived
the processing into cigarettes.

29:22.087 --> 29:24.885
- And have been carried
into Mulder's lungs as smoke?
- Right.

29:24.956 --> 29:28.323
Like spores or pollen.
Somehow small enough to be airborne.

29:28.393 --> 29:32.261
But Mulder isn't a smoker.
And neither was Scobie.

29:32.330 --> 29:35.390
Maybe they were around
someone who was.

29:44.342 --> 29:46.276
Don't bother calling security.

29:50.148 --> 29:52.241

as promised.

29:54.252 --> 29:56.186
Do it.

29:58.390 --> 30:00.824
You're gonna talk to me, Doctor.

30:00.892 --> 30:03.861
One of my agents is dying of
the same thing that killed Dr. Scobie.

30:03.929 --> 30:06.420
I believe you have information
that can save him.

30:06.498 --> 30:09.956
We stand by our contention
that any information is proprietary...

30:10.035 --> 30:12.936
and is therefore the sole property
of Morley Tobacco.

30:14.206 --> 30:16.140
Listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

30:16.208 --> 30:19.041
This isn't about Morley
or your precious research.

30:19.111 --> 30:22.171
This is about saving lives.

30:22.247 --> 30:25.045
- That's exactly what
we were trying to do.
- Dr. Voss.

30:25.117 --> 30:28.382
I'm advising you
not to speak.

30:28.453 --> 30:30.546
This has gone on long enough.

30:41.032 --> 30:44.195
We thought we were
doing a good thing.

30:44.269 --> 30:48.035
We knew people were never gonna stop
smoking, no matter how unhealthy it was.

30:48.106 --> 30:51.542
So why not genetically
engineer a safer cigarette?

30:53.078 --> 30:55.979
Except you engineered
the bugs as well.

30:56.047 --> 30:58.379
We recruited test smokers.

30:58.450 --> 31:01.317
We conducted focus groups.
There were no problems.

31:01.386 --> 31:04.378
And, uh, after
a few months in,

31:04.456 --> 31:08.483
things... things got bad.

31:11.663 --> 31:15.030
We had four test subjects and, uh,

31:19.271 --> 31:21.603
three of them died.

31:24.409 --> 31:27.207
Is that what Dr. Scobie
was gonna testify about?

31:27.279 --> 31:29.338
Yeah.

31:29.414 --> 31:33.145
And the company wanted us
to keep it quiet.

31:33.218 --> 31:37.348
I thought let's correct the mistakes
and face the consequences.

31:38.790 --> 31:41.520
Jim didn't.

31:41.593 --> 31:44.357
He was monitoring
the focus group, and that's...

31:46.364 --> 31:49.094
that's how he got infected.

31:52.304 --> 31:55.535
You said only three died.

31:55.607 --> 31:58.132
Who was the fourth?

- Clear!
- Okay, go ahead.

36:23.671 --> 36:26.265
We've got him stabilized
on ECMO for the moment,

36:26.340 --> 36:29.434
but we're not gonna be able
to maintain him on it for long.

36:29.510 --> 36:31.944
Of course you see why.

There's more than
there were six hours ago.

Our best bet is to go back in there.

36:39.553 --> 36:42.579

we have to crack the chest.

39:06.033 --> 39:08.866
But you know,
it doesn't have to be that way.

39:10.237 --> 39:12.865
I think Dr. Voss is really...

39:12.940 --> 39:15.465
on to something
with his research, I do.

39:15.543 --> 39:18.137
It's over, Weaver.
I'm through.

39:18.212 --> 39:20.544
Oh.

39:20.614 --> 39:24.175
Come on, now.
I mean, you gotta figure...

39:27.822 --> 39:30.791
the first, uh, car...

39:30.858 --> 39:33.588
killed a bunch of people...

39:33.661 --> 39:35.652
before they perfected it,

39:35.729 --> 39:40.291
'cause it's all just part
of the scientific process, you know.

39:41.535 --> 39:43.935
Mr. Weaver, I will shoot you.

39:49.577 --> 39:51.511
No, you won't.

40:04.056 --> 40:07.219
I'm a regular damn
scientific marvel.

40:10.896 --> 40:14.161
They're gonna study me.

40:14.233 --> 40:18.431
They're gonna write
scientific papers about me.

40:20.039 --> 40:22.098
I could be the cure for cancer.

40:25.044 --> 40:27.205
Me, Darryl Weaver.

40:38.457 --> 40:40.516
You ain't gonna shoot me.

40:49.435 --> 40:51.369
Toodles.

41:13.258 --> 41:15.852
- [Skinner] How's Mulder?
- Not good.

41:19.665 --> 41:22.600
Let's get the blood work
on this man.

41:40.519 --> 41:43.420
Wait a minute.

41:43.489 --> 41:45.650
Wait a minute.

41:45.724 --> 41:48.887
Give me 30 milligrams
of methyl-pyrrolidinyl-pyridine.

41:48.961 --> 41:50.986
- Nicotine?
- Yeah.

41:53.098 --> 41:55.464
I think this could
save Mulder's life.

42:09.548 --> 42:13.211
Hey. Good to be back?

42:13.285 --> 42:15.583
- [Hoarsely] Beats the alternative.
- Yeah.

42:15.654 --> 42:19.317
Well, you'll be interested to know
that Morley Tobacco has subpoenaed...

42:19.391 --> 42:21.621
all of our files
on the case.

42:21.693 --> 42:26.426
- They seem extremely interested
in your recovery.
- What about Darryl Weaver?

42:26.498 --> 42:30.400
He's, uh, well enough to have
been moved to the hospital ward
at Riley Correctional.

42:30.469 --> 42:34.405
It was the nicotine itself
that was keeping him alive?

42:34.473 --> 42:37.965
His fingertips were stained yellow with
it. He was a four-pack a day smoker,

42:38.043 --> 42:41.103
far heavier than any
of the focus group members who died.

42:41.180 --> 42:44.115
You know, nicotine is
extremely poisonous.

42:44.183 --> 42:46.674
It's actually one of
the oldest known insecticides.

42:46.752 --> 42:49.084
It's good for killing
tobacco beetles.

42:49.154 --> 42:52.089
Well, once we loaded your system up
with enough of it,

42:52.157 --> 42:55.456
it acted as a sort of
chemotherapy.

42:55.527 --> 42:58.519
Except it almost stopped
your breathing at the same time.

42:58.597 --> 43:00.861
That's not all it did.

43:07.506 --> 43:09.440
I bought these
on the way to work.

43:11.143 --> 43:13.338
You're not gonna start smoking.

43:13.412 --> 43:16.609
Why not? They say the addiction
is stronger than heroin.

43:16.682 --> 43:18.547
Mulder.

43:27.459 --> 43:30.189
Good. Skinner's waiting for us
in his office.

43:30.262 --> 43:32.321
I'll be right up.

44:26.349 --> 44:28.283
[Child]
I made this!

44:29.305 --> 44:35.710
