01:16.080 --> 01:18.200
<i>Wilt thou, Magdelana Borst...</i>

01:18.280 --> 01:20.600
<i>take this man
to thy wedded husband...</i>

01:20.680 --> 01:24.240
<i>to love, comfort, honor and
obey him, and forsaking all others...</i>

01:24.320 --> 01:26.600
keep thee only unto him
so long as ye both shall live?

01:26.640 --> 01:28.880
I will.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.440
Oh!

01:31.520 --> 01:34.160
Wilt thou, Gilbert Martin,
take this woman to thy wedded wife...

01:34.240 --> 01:36.360
to love, comfort
and honor her...

01:36.400 --> 01:39.640
and forsaking all others, keep thee
only unto her so long as ye both shall live?

01:39.720 --> 01:42.080
- I will.
- Let us pray.

01:45.280 --> 01:48.520
O Almighty God, look down upon
and bless these two young people...

01:48.560 --> 01:51.160
as they go forth this day
into the wilderness...

01:51.240 --> 01:54.080
<i>to make for themselves
a new home.</i>

01:54.160 --> 01:56.040
<i>Guide them,
Gracious Father...</i>

01:56.080 --> 01:59.280
protect and keep them through
all the trials and vicissitudes of life...

01:59.320 --> 02:02.680
that they may never cease
to remember this hour...

02:02.760 --> 02:05.120
and this pledge of love which
they have given, one to the other...

02:05.200 --> 02:08.039
<i>in thy sacred sight.</i>

02:08.080 --> 02:10.000
Amen.

02:23.080 --> 02:25.960
<i>And now, in the name
of the Father...</i>

02:26.040 --> 02:29.680
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,
I pronounce you man and wife.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.760
<i>What God hath joined together...</i>

02:32.840 --> 02:34.680
<i>let not man put asunder.</i>

02:36.080 --> 02:37.960
Kiss her, my son.

02:49.760 --> 02:53.400
- Lana! Lana, throw it!

03:06.560 --> 03:09.040
- Good-bye.
- God bless you, Gilbert.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.840
- Good-bye, sir.
- Good-bye, son.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.800
Good-bye, Mrs. -
Mother.

03:20.320 --> 03:23.200
- Take good care of her.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.640
Wait till she sees this.

03:25.680 --> 03:29.280
Good-bye. Good-bye.

03:29.360 --> 03:32.120
- That sure was a nice weddin'.
- Wasn't it?

03:32.200 --> 03:34.040
- The cow hitched easy?
- Cow?

03:41.280 --> 03:44.200
- Giddyap.
- Mother, good-bye.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.200
Bye.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.040
- Good-bye.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.960
- Oh, no, my friends.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.280
It's always been like this
since Bible days.

03:57.360 --> 04:01.720
Every generation must make
its own way in one place or another.

04:22.880 --> 04:26.560
- It's the most beautiful country I've ever seen.
- I told you so.

04:26.640 --> 04:30.920
The Mohawk Valley is the prettiest place
in the whole country, for a fact.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.880
Susie.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.920
Gin.

05:07.480 --> 05:11.200
Have one. Just especial,
seeing it's tonight.

05:12.880 --> 05:16.400
- You folks come far?
- Yes. Albany.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.560
- Where?
- Albany!

05:20.520 --> 05:22.680
<i>- Albany.
- Yes.</i>

05:22.760 --> 05:24.600
Been married long?

05:28.040 --> 05:30.360
Oh, not so long.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.320
How long?

05:33.760 --> 05:35.600
Not so long!

05:37.680 --> 05:39.640
I- I thought
that's what you said.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.680
I knew it the minute
I laid eyes on ya.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.920
Honeymooners.

05:50.360 --> 05:53.120
You got it written
all over both of you.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.880
Honeymooners!

06:22.320 --> 06:24.680
To your health, madam, sir.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.200
You planning on settling here
in the valley?

06:31.280 --> 06:33.440
Yes. I have a place at Deerfield.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.880
Deerfield? That's pretty
far out of the way, isn't it?

06:35.920 --> 06:37.800
Yes, but it suits me.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.680
What political party do you folks
up that way belong to?

06:40.720 --> 06:42.800
The American.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.560
Any Tories?

06:45.640 --> 06:47.800
Not that I know of. Why?

06:47.880 --> 06:50.440
Oh, nothing.
I was just wondering.

06:50.520 --> 06:54.080
They say the Indians are going to line up
with the British, but I suppose that's just talk.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.720
Well, good night.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.480
That's a queer one, ain't he?
Too many questions to suit me.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.360
And that patch over his eye-

07:12.400 --> 07:16.120
I bet he lost it trying to see something
that wasn't none of his business.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.800
Good night.
Good night now.

07:21.880 --> 07:24.160
Good night.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.160
You didn't get scared, did you,
at what that fella just said...

07:37.200 --> 07:40.280
about the Tories and the Indians?

07:40.360 --> 07:43.640
I wasn't even thinking
about Indians.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.800
What were you thinking about?

07:47.160 --> 07:50.520
I was just wondering...

07:50.600 --> 07:53.160
if you love me
as much as I love you.

08:25.720 --> 08:28.640
Are there always flies like this?

08:28.720 --> 08:31.560
In the real woods there are.

08:31.640 --> 08:34.600
It must be gonna rain, though,
the way these take hold.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.760
You'll get used to 'em
up here, though.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.960
Lana, we're home now! Look!

09:27.880 --> 09:30.040
I'll get a fire going.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.760
It's just a cabin, but-

10:23.840 --> 10:27.560
Well, I've always thought
it would be nice living in a cabin.

10:27.600 --> 10:31.160
It's so handy to look
after things when it's small.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.760
It seemed so fine to me
because I built it.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.280
I didn't realize it might
look different to a girl...

10:38.320 --> 10:40.320
who'd been raised
in a big house like yours.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.680
Oh, it's all right, Gil.
Beginning this way...

10:43.760 --> 10:47.200
we'll like our things
even better when we get them.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.840
Oh, Lana.

10:56.400 --> 11:00.400
Just wait till I put up the mare and we get
something to eat and feel warmer. We'll-

11:04.240 --> 11:06.560
Things will look different then.

11:08.400 --> 11:12.680
You'd better take those wet things off, Lana.
You'll be sick.

11:40.640 --> 11:43.760
No! Gil! Gil!

11:43.840 --> 11:47.480
Gil! Gil!

11:49.440 --> 11:52.320
Oh, Gil! Gil!

11:52.400 --> 11:54.440
<i>Gil! Gil!</i>

11:54.520 --> 11:56.520
- Get him! Do something!
- Why, Lana, that's only Blue Back.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.840
<i>- He'll murder us! He'll murder us!
- Lana, stop that!</i>

11:58.920 --> 12:00.840
Gil-

12:04.600 --> 12:07.000
I'm sorry, Lana.
I had to do it.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.880
You've gotta get
a hold of yourself.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.080
This is my wife, Blue Back.

12:18.160 --> 12:20.160
She's kind of nervous
and tired out.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.160
We had a long, hard trip
in the rain and everything.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.080
Sure. Much rain.

12:25.160 --> 12:28.640
I guess she didn't expect anybody
to drop in at a time like this.

12:28.720 --> 12:32.400
Me go hunting.
Bring you half deer. Hang outside.

12:32.480 --> 12:36.000
Half deer, huh? Well, that's mighty fine
of you, Blue Back. Thanks.

12:36.080 --> 12:40.160
Sit down. I got some rum outside.
We'll have a drink together.

12:40.240 --> 12:44.680
No. Me go now.
Come back again, maybe.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.720
Sure, any time.

12:46.800 --> 12:50.520
- You're a good friend, Blue Back.
- Sure, fine friends.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.520
Good Christian!

12:57.600 --> 12:59.440
Hallelujah!

13:25.360 --> 13:27.280
Lana.

13:27.320 --> 13:30.720
- I'm going home.
- Home?

13:30.800 --> 13:33.440
I can't stand it!

13:33.520 --> 13:36.680
Mother was right.
I'm no frontier woman.

13:36.720 --> 13:39.600
I had no idea it was like this.
I hate it!

13:39.680 --> 13:43.120
- Lana, what are you saying?
- You had no right to bring me here!

13:43.200 --> 13:47.560
It- It's awful! And that horrible man-
that Indian slipping in here.

13:47.600 --> 13:50.840
Now you're acting crazy again.
Blue Back wouldn't hurt you.

13:50.920 --> 13:53.920
- Why, he's as good a Christian
as you or me, maybe better.
- I don't care!

13:54.000 --> 13:57.360
<i>- I'm going home. I'm going now! Gil!
- No, you're not.</i>

13:57.440 --> 14:01.520
You're gonna stay right here
and do as I say from now on.

14:01.600 --> 14:05.160
You're gonna get over this foolishness
and stop being scared. Do you understand?

14:24.080 --> 14:27.080
Lana, I didn't wanna hit you.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.200
I had to do it.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.480
Lana, look at me.

14:33.520 --> 14:36.840
I love you.
I need you.

14:36.920 --> 14:40.040
I can't live without you now.
You know that.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.000
Yes.

14:50.840 --> 14:53.800
Look, here's Blue Back again, see?

14:58.520 --> 15:00.760
You got a fine woman.

15:03.160 --> 15:05.440
But you young man.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.440
You use this on her.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.880
Lick her good!

15:11.960 --> 15:14.080
Make fine woman.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.000
<i>What are you
thinking about now?</i>

16:14.440 --> 16:16.280
Gil.

16:16.360 --> 16:19.600
What are you thinking about?

16:19.640 --> 16:24.960
Oh, I was just thinking about what this place
is gonna look like couple years from now.

16:25.040 --> 16:30.600
Next summer we can start building a barn,
right on that slope over there.

16:30.680 --> 16:33.360
A hillside barn,
just like I've always wanted.

16:34.960 --> 16:39.480
Then after that, we can start thinking
about building a decent house.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.000
I like our house
just as it is now.

16:46.080 --> 16:50.560
Oh, sure. But I always remember
how you ladies hanker after frame houses.

16:52.560 --> 16:56.880
Well, I suppose the place will look so beautiful
you won't care what your wife looks like.

16:56.960 --> 17:00.000
I can get blisters all over my hands,
and my nose peeled...

17:00.080 --> 17:02.480
and that's the thanks
I get for it.

17:02.560 --> 17:04.720
Let's see some of those blisters
you're talking so big about.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.359
No! No, never mind! Leave me alone.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.319
Let it go.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.960
Why, Lana, your hand is sore.

17:13.040 --> 17:15.119
- Maybe you oughtn't come out here like this.
- I want to.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.680
I know, but haying's hard work.
It's about the hardest work there is.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.160
It's... no job for a woman.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.079
Oh, now, there you go.

17:22.160 --> 17:26.040
Just because a woman is raised
in a town, she has to be frail.

17:26.119 --> 17:30.440
I'm not. I'm strong. You said yourself
you couldn't have done without me.

17:30.520 --> 17:33.600
- I sure married myself some good hired help.
- No, no! Now stop.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.560
Stop it yourself.

17:37.080 --> 17:40.000
Do you like me as much
as you do your old farm?

18:02.480 --> 18:05.520
- Good morning, ladies.
- Hello, Gil.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.840
- Hello.
- Good morning, Gil.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.360
- Hello, Gil! Good morning, Lana!
- Good morning.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.280
Joe.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.720
Mighty pretty.

18:31.760 --> 18:34.960
- Oh, General Herkimer.
- Hello, Martin.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.400
This is my wife, Lana.

18:37.480 --> 18:40.720
<i>Ja. Ja. Hübsch.</i>

18:40.760 --> 18:43.560
She's as pretty
as the near side of a peach.

18:46.040 --> 18:49.200
Maybe prettier.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.920
- Reall.
- And, Lana, this is Mrs. Weaver and her husband.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.480
I'm your nearest neighbor.
I've been meaning to call...

18:54.520 --> 18:56.920
me and George
and John here, my boy.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.760
<i>- How do?
- I'm so glad to meet you.</i>

18:59.800 --> 19:03.320
And this is Christian's wife, Mrs. Reall,
and her daughter Martha Ellen.

19:03.400 --> 19:06.000
- How do you do?
- Howdy. And this is my oldest girl, Mary.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.920
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello, Mrs. Martin.

19:07.960 --> 19:10.520
- And Mrs. Demooth.
- My husband is the captain.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.800
How do you do?

19:12.880 --> 19:15.120
- Oh, how do you do?
- And Dr. Petry.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.080
How do, Mrs. Martin?

19:18.440 --> 19:20.920
Oh, pass the lot of 'em.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.840
Um-

19:25.880 --> 19:27.840
Fall in! Outside.

19:27.920 --> 19:30.880
All right, men.
Hup! Hup!

19:30.960 --> 19:34.040
Hup! Hup! Hup!

19:34.120 --> 19:35.960
<i>Hup! Hup!</i>

19:36.040 --> 19:38.320
<i>Hup! Hup!</i>

19:38.360 --> 19:41.200
Don't be afraid of these women, Mrs. Martin.
You'll find they're good neighbors...

19:41.240 --> 19:44.240
once they get over being mad at you
for being so pretty.

19:44.280 --> 19:48.880
- Oh, don't be so silly.
- That bonnet you got on
is giving them a lot of worry.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.920
And they're dying
to shoo us men off...

19:51.000 --> 19:53.560
so they can find out if you and Gil
have got a family on the way.

19:53.640 --> 19:56.040
- Oh, Nicholas Herkimer!
- We weren't gonna tell anybody.

19:56.120 --> 19:58.080
<i>- Lana!</i>

19:58.160 --> 20:00.640
Oh, that's just fine.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.560
- Congratulations, Martin.
- Thank you.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.680
That's just fine. A baby.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.960
You know, I don't believe
in young folks waiting.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.360
- I always say a man needs help on his place...
- Stick out your tongue.

20:10.400 --> 20:13.840
And the only way to get it
is to have children, especially boys.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.440
- Why, Maggie Weaver, how awful.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.920
Militia, fall in!

20:20.000 --> 20:22.640
- Fall in what?

20:25.920 --> 20:28.080
Attention.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.040
Dress to the right.

20:30.080 --> 20:33.680
- That's my husband.

20:33.720 --> 20:35.640
Call the roll.

20:37.440 --> 20:39.000
<i>- Amos Brock.
- Here.</i>

20:39.080 --> 20:40.960
- John Weaver?
- Here!

20:41.040 --> 20:43.160
- George Weaver.
- Here.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.520
- Gilbert Martin.
- Here.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.680
Christian Reall.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.800
Christian Reall!

20:53.280 --> 20:55.560
Christian-

20:55.640 --> 20:58.120
That's me. Here.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.400
- Adam Hartman.

21:00.480 --> 21:03.920
- Here.
- James McNod.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.840
James McNod!

21:05.880 --> 21:08.600
He couldn't come today.
He had to go and buy flour.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.720
Then I've got to fine him.
That's the law.

21:10.800 --> 21:14.400
It don't look to me as though you had any right
to fine a man for not coming if he can't!

21:14.480 --> 21:17.120
I thought that's what
this war was about-

21:17.200 --> 21:20.080
making people pay taxes when
they didn't have no say-so about it.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.640
That's right. That's what
I'm carrying Long Tom for.

21:22.720 --> 21:25.720
Ain't up to me.
Talk to the general.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.320
Oh, I guess we can
let that go this time.

21:28.400 --> 21:31.960
And that's enough of the roll call too.
You can check up later.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.200
Stand at ease, men.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.840
Neighbors...

21:39.920 --> 21:44.520
ever since New York and the 12 colonies
signed the Declaration of Independence...

21:44.600 --> 21:46.960
this revolution
has turned into a real war.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.480
<i>So far we've been lucky
up here in the Mohawk...</i>

21:50.520 --> 21:53.440
<i>but it looks like we are going to be
dragged into it too.</i>

21:53.520 --> 21:55.360
Sure as shootin'.

21:55.440 --> 21:59.560
That's why I got you here-
to get ready, no matter what happens.

22:00.840 --> 22:03.840
I guess we all feel
the same way about it.

22:03.920 --> 22:06.000
This is our home and our land.

22:06.080 --> 22:08.360
And I say it's worth
fighting for...

22:08.440 --> 22:11.480
only we got to do it
by ourselves.

22:11.560 --> 22:13.880
Congress can't help us.

22:13.960 --> 22:16.480
They say Washington needs
all the troops he can get...

22:16.560 --> 22:19.320
and that the frontier
will have to look out for itself.

22:19.400 --> 22:24.200
Maybe them regular soldiers don't like the kind
of liquor we drink up here, huh, General?

22:24.280 --> 22:26.000
Adam!

22:26.080 --> 22:30.640
Maybe not,
but that's what they say.

22:30.720 --> 22:33.440
Now, about the Indians,
from all I hear...

22:33.520 --> 22:36.640
the Tories are making them
a lot of big promises.

22:36.720 --> 22:41.120
We got our agents working too,
but there's no telling which way they'll jump.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.040
Oh, I don't think we'll have
any trouble with the Indians.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.960
- We've always treated them fair.
- That's right.

22:45.040 --> 22:47.440
Maybe so, but just the same...

22:47.520 --> 22:50.560
if you hear the bell ringing
at the fort or the cannon go off...

22:50.640 --> 22:53.360
you drop everything
and come running.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.240
Do you understand?
All of you, come running.

22:56.280 --> 22:59.320
Else I have you flogged so fast
you won't know what.

23:01.760 --> 23:05.520
Now, come on. Show the women
how good you can drill.

23:05.560 --> 23:09.040
- Take them around the field, Captain.
- Attention!

23:09.080 --> 23:11.120
Nice talk, Nicholas.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.200
<i>Carry arms!</i>

23:13.280 --> 23:15.600
<i>Forward left, march!</i>

23:18.480 --> 23:20.360
All right!

23:36.440 --> 23:40.320
By thunder, I'll bet we can lick
the whole world the way we march.

24:07.760 --> 24:10.000
Ezra, help us over here!

24:10.040 --> 24:12.600
<i>Coming right along with you, Gil.</i>

24:12.680 --> 24:14.920
Put it right on top.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.320
<i>Look out now.
Come on! Come on!</i>

24:18.400 --> 24:20.960
<i>Now she's going good.</i>

24:21.040 --> 24:25.120
- How is the core- pretty rotten, Adam?
- Yeah.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.440
- Try to fall it right down in there.
- All right.

24:27.520 --> 24:31.480
<i>Keep working on the edge. That's the idea.</i>

24:33.240 --> 24:35.920
This'll make a nice patch for wheat, Gil.
You got good soil here.

24:35.960 --> 24:39.560
I figure the loam's
close to four feet.

24:39.640 --> 24:42.160
Yes, sir, I bet there isn't any better soil
in the whole valley.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.120
You're just a natural-born farmer,
ain't ya?

24:44.200 --> 24:46.040
So you'd be,
if you'd marry and settle down.

24:46.120 --> 24:48.720
There she goes!

24:48.800 --> 24:50.720
There she goes.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.880
That's gonna be good firewood.

24:59.280 --> 25:01.160
There it goes.

25:02.560 --> 25:05.120
Start heaving, Cleave.

25:05.200 --> 25:08.080
- Push her in, Gil.
- Push her in there.

25:08.160 --> 25:11.000
<i>Yeah, get on out!</i>

25:11.080 --> 25:14.120
- Make it straightaway.
- Heave!

25:14.200 --> 25:16.560
Heave! Heave!

25:21.320 --> 25:25.200
Come on! Come on.

25:25.280 --> 25:29.000
You certainly brought a lot of pretty things
with you, Mrs. Martin.

25:29.080 --> 25:31.840
- Heavenly.
- I told Mother there was no sense in bringing...

25:31.920 --> 25:33.760
a lot of clothes and such things.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.400
I'd rather have the money
spent on furniture.

25:36.480 --> 25:39.080
- I see you've got one of these feathers.
- Yes.

25:39.160 --> 25:41.320
Mother had five of them at home.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.280
She said there are times
in a woman's life...

25:43.320 --> 25:45.840
when something like that
is more important than bread.

25:45.920 --> 25:48.480
- What in the world is it?
- A pheasant's feather.

25:48.560 --> 25:51.360
Looks like it came out
of an angel's wing.

25:51.440 --> 25:55.920
We had a lot of them at home, but they collected
so much dust, we threw them out.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.440
Yes.

25:58.840 --> 26:01.680
This is a nice teapot.
What is it, Wedgwood?

26:01.760 --> 26:04.800
I don't know.
It's just white china, I guess.

26:04.880 --> 26:07.960
- It belonged to my grandmother.
- We always ate off Wedgwood at home.

26:08.040 --> 26:11.880
- Eat?
- Come on out! They've started burning already.

26:11.960 --> 26:15.280
- Great burning. Started it myself.
- Come on.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.920
Let's go see the burning.
Come on.

26:20.240 --> 26:22.120
Throw it on there.

26:25.560 --> 26:28.000
Gil, it's going to be beautiful.

26:35.280 --> 26:37.160
It's Blue Back!

26:39.720 --> 26:41.560
Indians on the warpath.

26:41.640 --> 26:44.120
Coming.

26:44.200 --> 26:47.560
Eight white men...

26:47.640 --> 26:49.640
100 Indians.

26:49.720 --> 26:52.960
Painted. Better hurry.

26:53.040 --> 26:56.360
- Johnny Weaver, get your horse
and tell General Herkimer.

26:56.440 --> 26:59.160
Stop it! Stop it!

26:59.240 --> 27:01.080
- Gil!
- Take this, Gil.

27:01.160 --> 27:03.680
- Thanks, Joe. Adam, watch out for Lana, will you?
- Come on, Lana.

27:03.760 --> 27:07.440
- No.
- You go too. Senecas, they kill.

27:07.480 --> 27:09.880
I can't leave my place,
the crops.

27:09.960 --> 27:14.000
Gil, you've got to. You've got to come.
I won't leave without you.

27:14.080 --> 27:16.480
All right, I'll get the cart.

27:19.320 --> 27:22.440
Indians. I know. Get.
Two, three, four-

27:22.520 --> 27:24.880
Two, three- One-
Four, five, six-

27:24.920 --> 27:28.080
Come on, Christian.
They're all here. Get in your wagon.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.320
- Here!
- Thanks.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.960
Gil, the cow,
aren't we going to take her?

27:59.000 --> 28:02.520
We can't take her.
She'll just slow us up.

28:19.160 --> 28:23.400
Oh, Gil, I can't stand it.
It's like leaving part of ourselves.

28:23.480 --> 28:26.240
Don't look back. Giddyap!

28:30.400 --> 28:33.440
<i>- Come on, Mary.
- Hurry up, Gil!</i>

28:33.520 --> 28:35.480
<i>Come on, Gil!</i>

28:37.280 --> 28:40.440
<i>- Mr. Martin!
- Whoa!</i>

28:40.520 --> 28:42.800
Come on, Mary!

28:42.840 --> 28:44.880
- Wait a minute.
- Where's the rest of your family?

28:44.960 --> 28:47.880
- I don't know. I lost them.
- Give her to me.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.160
Come on. Hurry up!

28:51.160 --> 28:53.480
- All right.
- Giddyap, Susie!

28:53.560 --> 28:55.520
Get!

29:03.240 --> 29:06.200
We got Mary and Martha with us.
Get 'em in, Christian.

29:06.280 --> 29:09.240
Climb right in the wagon here.
Come on, Trudy. You help Mary.

29:09.320 --> 29:12.360
- Trudy, where's Nancy?
- Here she is.

29:12.440 --> 29:14.280
- Where's Martha?
- Here's Martha.

29:14.360 --> 29:16.760
- We're gonna have to throw
some of this furniture out.
- Oh, no, Gil!

29:16.840 --> 29:18.720
We've got to.

29:20.680 --> 29:23.320
- We're ready, Gil.

29:27.320 --> 29:29.960
- I told you not to look back.

30:12.200 --> 30:15.160
Keep up there. Keep up there.

30:15.240 --> 30:18.120
- Come on. Pull ahead there.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.640
Mr. Martin!

31:25.160 --> 31:27.240
- You got her?
- Yeah.

31:27.320 --> 31:32.520
Gil! Gil, what's happened?
Oh! Mary Johnson!

31:32.600 --> 31:36.040
- Come on! Come on!

31:36.120 --> 31:38.880
- She was driving, and all of a sudden she fainted.

31:38.920 --> 31:41.680
Never mind. There.
Put her down.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.080
- Get up and get out of here!
- I won't! My husband's the captain.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.920
- Get out before I use a strap on you.
- No!

31:46.960 --> 31:49.320
Get some hot water,
and tell that fool doctor to hurry.

31:49.360 --> 31:53.400
- I don't understand. It's not like Lana.
- Never mind. She'll be all right.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.560
- What in thunder's the matter here?
- Oh, Doctor.

31:55.640 --> 31:58.080
- More sniveling women.
- It's my wife. She fainted.

31:58.160 --> 32:01.120
I can't say I blame her,
all this racket.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.680
<i>Gil. Gil Martin.</i>

32:03.760 --> 32:07.880
They're waiting for you, Gil.
The company's ready to go.

32:07.920 --> 32:10.320
- What is it, Doctor?
- Nothing you can do anything about.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.560
Go on. Get out of here.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.920
- How is she, Gil?
- I don't know.

32:25.960 --> 32:27.960
- Everything ready, Demooth?
- Yes, sir.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.680
Drummer boy, play the drum.

32:33.400 --> 32:35.880
Men, follow me!

33:01.800 --> 33:03.880
Adam, did you see them?
Did you catch them?

33:03.960 --> 33:06.880
No. We chased them seven, eight miles,
but they got away from us.

33:16.400 --> 33:19.800
- What happened?
- The excitement and all that
jolting was too much for her.

33:19.880 --> 33:22.920
Oh, but don't fret too much.
You're both young.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.280
You'll have another baby.

33:27.880 --> 33:31.280
Oh, she's all right now.
Just tired.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.920
But don't let her talk too much.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.400
Lana?

33:49.480 --> 33:51.360
Gil.

33:52.360 --> 33:54.880
Oh, Lana, darling.

33:54.960 --> 33:58.240
Gil, our house?

34:01.240 --> 34:03.640
They burned it.

34:03.720 --> 34:06.560
- The crops?
- Everything. I saw it coming back.

34:08.760 --> 34:10.600
Oh, and now-

34:10.679 --> 34:12.840
Please don't, Lana.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.719
- I failed you, Gil.
- No.

34:17.800 --> 34:20.880
No, Lana,
it wasn't your fault. It-

34:20.960 --> 34:23.520
It just happens
that way sometimes.

34:26.280 --> 34:28.360
My poor Gil.

34:31.679 --> 34:33.520
Oh, Lana.

34:34.760 --> 34:37.719
You're all right.
That's all I care about.

35:52.560 --> 35:56.200
It doesn't seem possible people
can work as hard as we did, Lana...

35:56.240 --> 35:58.200
for nothin'.

35:58.280 --> 36:01.800
We can build it back again, Gil.
We still have the land.

36:01.880 --> 36:05.160
You think I'd let you come back out here and
go through that sort of thing again?

36:05.240 --> 36:08.520
No, you were right
that first night.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.120
You should have gone home then.
I was a fool not to see it.

36:11.200 --> 36:15.040
- Gil.
- I never should have brought you
out here in the first place.

36:15.080 --> 36:18.560
This is no place for you.
It's no place for any woman.

36:18.640 --> 36:21.960
I'm not the only woman
who's gone through this, Gil.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.760
What'll we do?
How will we live?

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
Well, Adam says that Mrs. McKlennar's
hired man ran off...

36:31.080 --> 36:34.560
and she's looking for
a couple to work her place.

36:34.600 --> 36:38.000
But, Lana, why,
you can't hire out!

36:38.080 --> 36:40.000
A girl like you?
Do you think I'd-

36:40.040 --> 36:42.160
It wouldn't have to be for long.

36:42.240 --> 36:44.880
Just until we made enough
to come back here and start.

36:44.960 --> 36:46.800
Lana, you can't do it!

36:46.880 --> 36:49.920
Oh, Gil, it won't do any harm
just to talk it over with her.

36:49.960 --> 36:53.160
No! Hired help.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.120
No.

37:08.040 --> 37:09.920
Mrs. McKlennar.

37:35.880 --> 37:38.400
<i>Good morning.</i>

37:38.440 --> 37:40.960
- Your name Martin?
- Yes, ma'am.

37:44.720 --> 37:47.960
Well, go on and stare.
I know how I look.

37:48.040 --> 37:50.720
When that fool hired man of mine
got drunk and ran off...

37:50.760 --> 37:53.280
he left me with everything to do.

37:53.320 --> 37:56.920
Martin, I don't mind a man having his liquor,
so long as he knows how to hold it.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.360
When it fixes him
so's he can't do his work...

37:59.400 --> 38:02.760
then he'd better go someplace else,
and the quicker the better.

38:02.840 --> 38:06.720
Well, don't stand there with your mouths open.
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

38:11.080 --> 38:14.760
Now you're here on business,
so let's get down to it. You know how to farm?

38:14.800 --> 38:18.440
- I had my own place.
- Yes, I heard it was burned.

38:18.480 --> 38:21.440
Well, that's too bad,
but that's neither here nor there.

38:21.480 --> 38:26.240
Daisy! Get my dinner ready.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.520
I don't do much farming here.

38:28.600 --> 38:31.840
Just take care of the meadow
and feed my stock.

38:31.880 --> 38:35.280
But you can do what you like.
I'm a widow.

38:35.360 --> 38:39.960
My husband was
Captain Barnabas McKlennar.

38:40.040 --> 38:42.600
Barney.

38:42.680 --> 38:44.680
Barney.

38:44.760 --> 38:47.560
What was I saying?
Oh. I was brought up on army life...

38:47.600 --> 38:49.480
so when I give an order,
I expect to get it obeyed.

38:49.560 --> 38:52.840
- What?
- If I take your pay, I'll do the best I can.

38:52.880 --> 38:57.760
Well, I just don't want you coming around
afterwards complaining. That's all.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.720
How much do you want?

38:59.760 --> 39:02.240
<i>I never worked for anybody else.
What'd you expect to pay?</i>

39:02.280 --> 39:04.680
Forty-five pounds a year-
your house, the wood and food.

39:04.760 --> 39:08.600
If your wife can sew, I'll pay her too.
Can you sew, you, what's your name?

39:08.680 --> 39:11.680
<i>- Lana.
- Well, can you sew?</i>

39:11.720 --> 39:15.160
- Yes.
- Speak up! Speak up! You want to sew for me?

39:15.240 --> 39:19.680
- Yes, I'd like to.
- Well, let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands.

39:21.640 --> 39:23.560
Hmm.

39:24.960 --> 39:27.560
That's settled.

39:27.600 --> 39:31.080
I hate sewing myself.
Hate any housework.

39:31.160 --> 39:33.320
So I do the barn
and let Daisy do the cooking.

39:33.360 --> 39:38.560
I took good care of my husband.
Now he's gone, I do as I like.

39:38.600 --> 39:41.880
I've got a long face
and I poke it where I please.

39:41.960 --> 39:44.280
- You may think I'm a nuisance.
- Yes, ma'am.

39:44.360 --> 39:47.680
What? A nuis-
What? What'd he say?

39:47.760 --> 39:50.720
I didn't mean it.
But I guess if you do poke, I'll think so.

39:50.760 --> 39:52.360
Ah.

39:52.440 --> 39:56.120
Well, your thoughts are your own property,
Martin, but keep 'em to yourself.

39:56.200 --> 39:58.920
Come on. I suppose
you want to see your new home.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.720
I'll expect you to use the back door
if you want to ask me for anything.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.040
I don't want mud
tracked through my house.

40:04.080 --> 40:06.240
I track enough myself.

40:11.320 --> 40:13.880
A mess now.

40:13.960 --> 40:16.360
After that man.

40:16.440 --> 40:18.840
- But it's a good house.
- It sure is, ma'am.

40:18.920 --> 40:23.200
Nice chimney, nice bedroom upstairs.
I used to live here myself...

40:23.240 --> 40:26.360
till Barnabas took it into his head
to build that stone place.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.520
It's a beautiful house.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.480
Glad you got sense enough to see it.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.640
Now there's one more thing
I want to ask you. Got any furniture?

40:32.720 --> 40:35.560
We have a bed and a few things.

40:35.640 --> 40:37.600
Well, I'll help you out
with the rest.

40:37.680 --> 40:40.440
You can consider
the job yours, Martin.

40:41.920 --> 40:44.480
Now, any questions you want to ask?

40:44.560 --> 40:47.320
Yes, ma'am.
It's- I just-

40:47.400 --> 40:51.280
- Well, what? What?
- Well, do you belong to the right party?

40:51.360 --> 40:53.200
Right party!

40:53.280 --> 40:55.880
Martin, a woman hasn't got
any political opinions.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.840
I run this farm to suit myself.

40:57.920 --> 41:00.520
I'll shoot the daylights out of anybody-
British, Indian or American-

41:00.600 --> 41:03.400
that thinks he can come around here
monkeying in my business.

41:03.480 --> 41:05.320
- Does that satisfy you?
- Yes, ma'am.

41:05.400 --> 41:09.000
- Well, when can you move in?
- Well, will tomorrow be too soon?

41:09.040 --> 41:11.040
To-Tomorrow?
What's the matter with today?

41:11.080 --> 41:14.760
- Oh, we'll move in today!
- Good. Good.

41:16.320 --> 41:18.440
- Oh, Lana.
- Oh, Gil!

41:18.480 --> 41:22.760
Oh, Gil. Oh!

41:24.000 --> 41:27.400
Oh, Gil, it-
it's a beautiful fireplace.

41:32.200 --> 41:34.840
Hear me, O Lord

41:34.920 --> 41:37.880
<i>And that anon</i>

41:37.960 --> 41:40.520
To help me

41:40.600 --> 41:43.840
Make good speed

41:43.880 --> 41:46.760
Be thou my rock

41:46.800 --> 41:50.440
And house of stone

41:50.480 --> 41:53.320
My fence in time

41:53.400 --> 41:56.520
Of need

41:56.600 --> 42:02.720
Amen

42:13.960 --> 42:17.160
O Almighty God...

42:17.240 --> 42:19.200
hear us, we beseech thee...

42:19.280 --> 42:22.880
and bring succor and guidance...

42:22.920 --> 42:26.400
to those we are about
to bring to thy divine notice.

42:29.440 --> 42:33.480
First, we are thinking
of Mary Wollaber.

42:33.520 --> 42:36.840
She is just 16 years old...

42:36.880 --> 42:41.160
but she is keeping company
with a soldier from Fort Dayton.

42:43.320 --> 42:46.120
He's a Massachusetts man,
O Lord...

42:46.200 --> 42:48.680
and thou knowest no good
can come of that.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.840
Hallelujah!

42:53.120 --> 42:56.920
Now we are thinking
of the sick and infirm.

42:58.680 --> 43:03.120
Peter Paris has the flux real bad.

43:03.200 --> 43:07.080
His Uncle Isaacs,
who keeps the store in Dayton...

43:07.160 --> 43:10.240
asks for our prayers.

43:10.320 --> 43:13.200
And he says that he has
just got in a new supply...

43:13.280 --> 43:15.360
of calicos,
French broadcloths...

43:15.400 --> 43:19.520
<i>- fancy handkerchiefs,
new hats and heavy boots...
- Shh.</i>

43:19.560 --> 43:21.600
All at bargain prices.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.960
But most of all...

43:27.040 --> 43:29.760
we call upon thee, Lord Jehovah...

43:29.800 --> 43:32.200
O God of battles...

43:32.280 --> 43:37.080
to aid thy people
against the Tories...

43:37.160 --> 43:41.680
for I have disturbing news
for you that will sorrow this Sabbath.

43:44.240 --> 43:47.680
General Washington has advised us...

43:47.760 --> 43:53.280
that an enemy army of many Tories
and savage Indians...

43:53.360 --> 43:55.720
is even now on its way
to our beloved valley.

43:58.480 --> 44:01.600
Every man capable of bearing arms...

44:01.640 --> 44:03.920
between the ages of 16 and 60...

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
<i>will report tomorrow morning
to General Herkimer...</i>

44:09.480 --> 44:12.240
<i>at which time, a regiment...</i>

44:12.320 --> 44:14.560
of Washington's continental army...

44:14.640 --> 44:16.520
will arrive from Albany...

44:16.600 --> 44:19.680
under the command
of Colonel Fischer to help us.

44:22.920 --> 44:27.680
Any man failing to report for duty
will be promptly hanged.

44:27.760 --> 44:29.360
Amen.

44:34.120 --> 44:37.440
You stick close to Mrs. McKlennar,
Lana, and do what she says.

44:37.480 --> 44:39.400
Yes, Gil.

44:43.640 --> 44:45.760
Well, I'd better go now.

44:49.480 --> 44:51.680
Watch out for those new apple trees.

44:59.480 --> 45:01.320
Gil.

45:42.320 --> 45:44.240
Thank you, ma'am.

45:44.320 --> 45:47.360
It used to be Barney's,
but it's no use to me now.

45:47.440 --> 45:50.840
Might come in handy to you.

45:50.880 --> 45:53.880
Gil Martin, I'm gonna kiss ya,
so I better do it now...

45:53.960 --> 45:57.320
so's you won't go off with the taste
of a widow on your mouth.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.720
Many's the time
I've seen Barney go off...

46:56.800 --> 46:59.080
just that same way.

47:00.120 --> 47:02.680
Good-bye. He's off.

47:05.000 --> 47:09.160
Sometimes he'd wave.
Ten-to-one he wasn't even seeing me.

47:10.640 --> 47:13.800
He was thinking about
all those men, you see-

47:13.880 --> 47:16.920
all those men
going out to fight-

47:16.960 --> 47:19.600
to kill or be killed.

47:21.560 --> 47:24.080
Blast his eyes, loving it.

47:38.960 --> 47:43.040
So they sent you all the way over here
to tell us to come inside the fort, did they?

47:43.080 --> 47:47.640
It's orders. Where women and children
shall be gathered together, it says.

47:47.680 --> 47:50.400
Me and other men over 60
are to collect and protect 'em.

47:50.480 --> 47:54.960
You old rooster.
Don't you think I can look after myself?

47:55.040 --> 47:57.040
Yes, ma'am.
But it's orders.

47:57.120 --> 47:58.960
I been saving a corner shed for you.

47:59.040 --> 48:01.760
Shed! Do I look like
the kind of a woman...

48:01.800 --> 48:06.040
that would start living in a shed
at my time of life, like a cow?

48:06.080 --> 48:07.680
- Yes, ma'am.
- What?

48:07.760 --> 48:11.160
- No, ma'am.
- Go on, spit, man. Spit and get it over with.

48:11.240 --> 48:15.520
Hey! Not there! Outside! Go on.
Get on out of here. Go on.

48:16.920 --> 48:19.800
The old fool.
He can't even spit by himself.

48:39.640 --> 48:43.480
<i>Waiting, waiting.
That's all we women do, is wait.</i>

48:45.600 --> 48:49.920
<i>Well, no news is good news.</i>

48:58.280 --> 49:00.840
Why don't you sit down, Lana?

49:06.560 --> 49:08.800
Mosquitoes!

49:51.560 --> 49:54.960
Mrs. McKlennar! Lana!
Here they come!

49:55.040 --> 49:57.280
Come on out!
Here they come!

50:10.040 --> 50:12.240
Where's John?

50:14.080 --> 50:16.680
Have you seen Gil Martin?

50:21.120 --> 50:23.000
Gil.

50:33.400 --> 50:38.760
Take them inside. Go in. Anyone else, go in.

50:38.840 --> 50:41.080
Have you seen Gil Martin?

51:15.880 --> 51:19.160
I'm Robert Johnson, ma'am. Surgeon pro tem
of the 1st Regiment, New York line.

51:19.200 --> 51:22.440
Then don't stand there yapping about it.
Go on in and see the general.

51:22.520 --> 51:24.440
Yes, ma'am.

51:25.680 --> 51:28.720
Mark, where's Gil?
Gil Martin?

51:42.000 --> 51:44.280
Gil! Gil!

51:45.280 --> 51:47.200
Gil!

51:48.680 --> 51:50.520
Gil-

51:50.560 --> 51:52.760
I'm Captain Morgan, ma'am.

51:52.800 --> 51:55.520
There's nobody back of me alive.

51:55.560 --> 51:57.480
No.

52:20.040 --> 52:24.160
Well, General Herkimer, a fine mess
you've got yourself into this time.

52:26.320 --> 52:30.440
I tell this fellow to go away.
Look after the young ones.

52:30.520 --> 52:33.760
Shut up! You're not
giving orders in this house.

52:33.840 --> 52:37.000
What about it?

52:37.080 --> 52:40.880
It's- It's already mortified, ma'am.

52:40.960 --> 52:44.360
I- It'll have to come off.

52:48.480 --> 52:52.720
<i>- Ja, bitte?
- Ja, Nicholas.</i>

52:54.320 --> 52:57.000
- Wait till I light my pipe.
- Yes.

52:57.080 --> 52:59.200
Look out. John!

53:10.000 --> 53:11.840
Tell me something first, Doctor.

53:11.920 --> 53:15.040
Did you ever cut off a leg before?

53:17.120 --> 53:19.640
Why-Why, no, sir. I-

53:19.680 --> 53:23.960
Well, don't be ashamed.
A man has gotta start somewhere.

53:26.600 --> 53:31.280
I'll never forget
the first deer I shot.

53:42.680 --> 53:44.600
Gil?

53:44.680 --> 53:46.520
Gil?

53:54.600 --> 53:57.360
<i>- Lana? Lana.</i>

53:57.400 --> 53:59.800
Gil! Gil.

53:59.880 --> 54:02.760
Oh, thank God! Gil.

54:09.240 --> 54:11.400
It's so cold.

54:11.480 --> 54:13.480
Colder here than the woods.

54:13.560 --> 54:15.440
Yeah.

54:17.520 --> 54:19.600
Raining-

54:19.640 --> 54:21.520
Lying there-

54:26.680 --> 54:29.920
I remember thinking
how hot it was...

54:31.240 --> 54:33.960
wondering-

54:34.040 --> 54:36.320
- I'm cold.
- Yes, dear.

54:38.520 --> 54:41.200
Wondering how long
we'd be away...

54:41.240 --> 54:43.720
when it happened.

54:43.800 --> 54:46.240
- I heard a crackling...
- Daisy. Daisy, some water.

54:46.320 --> 54:48.720
Like a stick breaking...

54:48.760 --> 54:51.640
and all of sudden, the fella
next to me stopped talking...

54:51.720 --> 54:54.160
and fell over on his side.

54:55.640 --> 54:57.840
Then I heard a whistle.

54:57.880 --> 54:59.880
Shots from everywhere.

55:01.800 --> 55:04.640
Somebody shouted
we'd been ambushed.

55:04.720 --> 55:07.600
- I saw General Herkimer slide off his horse...
- Oh.

55:07.640 --> 55:09.840
And grab his knee.

55:10.960 --> 55:14.560
Peter Ten Eyck with
his head blown half-off.

55:16.560 --> 55:20.400
Oh, darling, this is going to hurt.

55:20.440 --> 55:23.800
- Somebody told me to lay down...

55:23.880 --> 55:26.320
And then I saw 'em...

55:26.400 --> 55:30.120
all smeared with paint-
yellow and red-

55:32.400 --> 55:34.320
every color.

55:35.880 --> 55:37.720
Oh, darling, I'm sorry.

55:37.800 --> 55:40.360
In back of 'em,
Tories with green coats.

55:41.640 --> 55:45.520
I got down back of a log
and aimed at a fella.

55:45.560 --> 55:48.080
He leaped straight up
in the air.

55:48.160 --> 55:51.960
- Darling, don't talk about it.
- He fell forward on his face.

55:52.040 --> 55:54.200
- After that we...

55:54.280 --> 55:57.560
Just kept shootin' as fast
as we could load...

55:57.600 --> 55:59.800
for I don't know how long.

56:02.680 --> 56:04.800
Amos-

56:04.880 --> 56:07.280
Adam Hartman came over beside me.

56:08.480 --> 56:10.920
His musket was broke.

56:14.040 --> 56:16.680
But he had a spear.

56:16.760 --> 56:19.480
He kept grinnin'.

56:19.520 --> 56:22.080
I remember thinkin'...

56:22.160 --> 56:25.680
"He's havin' a good time.
He likes this."

56:28.280 --> 56:30.240
Pretty soon he pointed off.

56:30.320 --> 56:35.200
- I saw an Indian comin' towards us, naked.
- Darling, don't talk.

56:35.280 --> 56:37.920
I tried to load,
but it was too late.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.920
Adam stood up
and braced his spear...

56:42.000 --> 56:44.040
and the Indian came down.

56:45.320 --> 56:49.800
I never saw a fella
look so funny, so surprised.

56:51.080 --> 56:54.000
He just... hung there...

56:54.080 --> 56:56.360
with his mouth open...

56:56.440 --> 56:59.120
lookin' at us
and not sayin' a word.

57:03.000 --> 57:07.040
- I had to shoot him.
There wasn't anything else to do.
- Oh.

57:07.120 --> 57:10.840
- I had to!
- Yes, dear.

57:11.920 --> 57:15.200
<i>- Brandy, Nicholas?
- Ja, ja.</i>

57:16.280 --> 57:19.600
Swallow. Swallow.

57:26.680 --> 57:31.120
- Now, Nicholas?

57:31.160 --> 57:33.080
Go ahead.

57:37.240 --> 57:39.520
Then it started to rain...

57:40.760 --> 57:42.680
and I was sick.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.960
All the time General Herkimer just sat there
smoking his pipe and holding his knee.

57:53.560 --> 57:55.440
Then he said we'd all
better go home.

57:55.480 --> 57:58.680
Oh, darling, don't talk about it.

57:58.760 --> 58:01.240
Out of 600 of us...

58:01.320 --> 58:04.800
about 240 were still alive...

58:06.680 --> 58:08.760
but we'd won.

58:08.840 --> 58:11.960
- We licked 'em.
- Yes, darling.

58:12.040 --> 58:15.600
- We showed 'em they couldn't take this valley.
- Yes, darling.

58:15.640 --> 58:17.520
- Lana?
- Yes, dear.

58:17.560 --> 58:19.920
Do you hear? We'd won.

58:19.960 --> 58:23.160
Yes, darling. You won.

58:23.200 --> 58:28.000
Now you've got to sleep, Gil. You-

58:29.240 --> 58:32.200
Adam. Adam,
help me get him down.

58:35.480 --> 58:38.000
- Get that pack there.
- Uh-huh. Yes.

58:38.080 --> 58:41.040
- Here.

58:46.080 --> 58:48.040
Sleep, darling.

58:55.440 --> 58:57.360
You sleep.

59:19.720 --> 59:21.640
Lana?

59:24.040 --> 59:27.600
- Lana?

59:27.680 --> 59:31.240
Oh, Gil. Gil.

59:31.320 --> 59:34.800
I feel as if I've been asleep forever.

59:34.840 --> 59:37.520
You needed it.

59:37.560 --> 59:40.120
I've been lyin' here
lookin' at you...

59:40.200 --> 59:42.080
thinkin' how pretty you are.

59:42.160 --> 59:44.160
Oh, darling.

59:44.240 --> 59:48.760
Made me think of the first days
we had together at Deerfield.

59:50.080 --> 59:52.320
I've been thinking
about that too-

59:52.400 --> 59:54.240
the things we'd planned.

59:56.360 --> 59:59.760
While I was out there...

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:04.680
I kept thinking about you
all the time-

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:10.200
about how good it'll be when everything's
over and we can go back home.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:15.240
Gil, the Indians-

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.600
They won't be coming back
this way again, will they?

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:20.920
Oh, I don't reckon they'd have the nerve
after the lickin' we gave 'em.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.840
Why?

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:29.120
We're going to have
another baby.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.160
Are you glad, Lana?

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:43.520
I feel as-

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:47.160
I feel as though
I'd just begun to live all over again.

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.640
Are you hungry?

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.280
Doctor, how is General Herkimer?

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.200
General Herkimer is dead.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.360
We couldn't stop the bleeding.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.960
<i>"'I am the resurrection,
and the life, 'saith the Lord.</i>

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:26.840
<i>- "He that believeth in me...</i>

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.720
<i>"though he were dead,
:</i>

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.920
<i>And whosoever liveth
and believeth-"</i>

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.960
<i>"I know my redeemer liveth...</i>

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:45.200
<i>"and that he shall stand
at the latter :</i>

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:49.600
<i>"And though after my skin
worms destroy this body...</i>

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:54.040
<i>yet in my flesh
I shall see God. "</i>

01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:59.960
Come on, Gil.
Don't stop now.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:03.400
You know what Doc Petry said about havin'
plenty of hot water on hand.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.920
I know, but the water's boiled away twice already,
and nothing's happened yet.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.080
I don't know why we gotta have so much
hot water when babies are born anyhow.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.080
Mr. Martin! Mr. Martin!

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:15.120
Miss McKlennar wants you at once!

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:39.960
<i>Gil! Gil.</i>

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.960
One of Barney's soldiers made this cradle.
Give it to me the night we were married.

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.240
Your Lana might as well have it.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.240
- Hmm?
- That's mighty kind of you, ma'am.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.000
Oh, nonsense!
What good is it to me?

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.960
Can't ever tell. A good lookin' widow like you.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.320
Ah, shut up.
You make me sick.

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:01.360
- Great big good-for-nothing loudmouthed fool!

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.360
<i>- Even if you are good lookin'! Ooh!
- Stop!</i>

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:06.080
- Get out of my way!
- Ooh.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:14.000
- Oh!

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.560
Oh! Poor Gil.

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.040
- Not yet, boys. Not yet.
- Huh?

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.960
- No.

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:35.800
It's the waiting around that-

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.760
Not knowing what's going on.

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.480
Why can't Dr. Petry do somethin'?
Why can't he?

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.480
I don't know, Gil.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:49.760
Blue Back, you've had a lot of experience
in this business. What do you think?

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.760
Having babies,
that's woman's business.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:58.400
She better go far, far by herself.
Leave husband alone!

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.040
<i>Daisy!</i>

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:05.000
Daisy, hurry with those things.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.240
This is terrible.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.200
<i>Gil! Gil Martin!</i>

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.520
Get some hot water, quick!

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:21.680
- That's all right. That's all right.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:24.760
George Weaver, you keep away
from that springhouse.

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:28.440
Uh, I'll get some-
I'll get some more wood.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:53.560
It's a boy.
Praise be to the Lord.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:57.000
A boy. Gil. Gil!

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.040
It-It- It's a-

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:03.840
- It's a boy.
- It's a boy.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.480
<i>It's a boy.
Joe, we got a boy!</i>

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.440
- Give me that.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.360
Mmm.

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.600
Christian, it's a boy.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:15.120
We got a baby boy.

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.280
- What?
- A baby boy!

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.200
- A boy?
- Yes!

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.560
- A baby boy?
- Sure!

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.680
And to think, at my age...

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.760
another son.

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.920
- Get some brandy.
- Yes, sir.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.800
- Brandy? For a little-
- No. For you.

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.200
Go on in.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:37.960
- Is- Is she all right?
- Fit as a fiddle.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:46.520
- Well, who does he look like?
- He's gonna faint. He's-

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:49.400
Oh, Lana, never again.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.880
Gil.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:15.600
I prayed so hard
it would be a boy.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.400
Take him in your arms,
just for a moment.

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.520
Oh-

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.720
Go ahead.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.040
Doggone.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:01.920
Well, I'll be doggoned.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:10.000
<i>Yoo-hoo!
Come on, everybody! The dance is starting.</i>

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.760
<i>- Come on.</i>

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:07.680
- I'll bet Barney
never kissed you like that!

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:11.720
Barney McKlennar was a real man.
When he kissed you, you stayed kissed.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.640
Let's see if he taught you
how to hold your liquor.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.120
He didn't need to.
I was born knowing that.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.680
Hooray!

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:27.880
To the greatest crop in the Mohawk Valley
and the man who's responsible for it...

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.920
Gil Martin!

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:35.120
To the bride and groom,
Mary and John Weaver.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.319
May they always be as happy
as they are tonight.

01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:58.680
Please, God.

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.800
Please let it go on
like this forever.

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:30.760
Come on, Gilly.

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:34.720
You're gonna help Mommy
find some nice wild honey.

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:38.040
Upsy-daisy. Come on.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.000
There we go.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:56.160
- That you, Daisy? Go away. Go away.

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:15.040
What do you want?
What are you doing here?

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.480
Answer me! What do you mean
coming in my house?

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:19.440
Burn house. Fire quick.

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.760
Don't you dare,
you filthy drunken rascal!

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.040
Ah! Get out of here quick
before I skin you alive.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.400
Get out of here!
What are you doing?

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:34.320
My bed!
Ah, you crazy horse thieves!

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.440
If I could get my hands on a butcher knife!

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:41.680
Daisy! Daisy! Lana! Gil! Gil!

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.800
- My bed! Take your hands off that bed!

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:47.560
Take your- Oh!

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.960
- You go quick, old woman! You catch fire!
- Old woman!

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.040
I won't move a step without my bed.

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:56.040
- My husband bought this bed
the day after I was married-

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.600
Stop that! Shame on you.
Get this bed out of here quick.

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.520
- Quick! Get this out of here!

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:03.240
- Sure. Fine. We take bed.
- Hurry up! Hurry up!

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:07.000
Quick! Hurry up, you fools!
I'll have your ears lopped off for this.

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:10.360
- Ah! Put it out!

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:13.440
You fools! Upside down.
Turn it upside down.

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.360
Turn it upside down.

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.680
- Turn it up! Turn it up-

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.600
You fools!

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:50.600
- Mrs. McKlennar! Mrs. -

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:53.480
- Oh! Mrs. McKlennar! What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- Away! Away!

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.440
- You've got to get out!
- Go away! Go away!

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:59.280
My husband built this house. I've lived in it
all my life, and I'm not going to leave it.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.400
- Go away. Go away.
- You've got to come!

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:13.440
<i>- Listen to me! You cannot stay-
- Lana!</i>

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:16.360
- Gil! Gil. Gil.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:19.080
- Go away and leave me alone, Gil.
- Mrs. McKlennar!

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.200
Lana! Gil!

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:24.320
<i>Gil! Lana! Andrusville
has just been wiped out.</i>

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:27.840
There's over a thousand of ‘em headed this way
under Caldwell. You've got to get to the fort!

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.800
Take him. Mrs. McKlennar,
you've got to come!

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.440
- I'm not leaving this house.
I've lived in it all my life.
- Come on, Sarah.

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.680
Go away! Hartman,
leave me alone!

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.440
Leave me alone!

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.280
Oh, Almighty God...

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:43.760
by whose divine assistance
Samson did smite the Philistines...

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:47.560
hip and thigh
with great slaughter...

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:52.240
help thy people now gird up
their loins for the coming battle.

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:56.640
<i>Put courage
in our hearts, Lord...</i>

01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:00.000
<i>that we may drive our enemies
back into the wilderness.</i>

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:04.000
For we all know only too well
what will happen to us...

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:08.640
<i>if these sons of Belial
ever get over these walls...</i>

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.760
or come in through that gate...

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.080
which, with
thy permission, Lord...

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.040
I now order closed.

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:16.960
Amen.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.880
Close the gate.

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:27.080
Tether all the animals
or drive 'em out!

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.040
You women and children,
go into the church.

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.960
Hallelujah, men!

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.240
- Let's go!

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.240
<i>If you can't get
your hair under those hats, cut it off!</i>

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:56.520
<i>It won't do any good anyhow
if those greasy devils get in here.</i>

01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:00.600
- Daisy. Daisy.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:11.880
- Now sing, children. Sing in praise of the Lord.

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:14.000
Woman!

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.840
<i>Brother Reall!</i>

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.800
Put down that devil's brew.

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.960
I was only trying to get rid of it...

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.200
so- so's them heathens
wouldn't get it.

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:39.400
Beware of the heathen within thine
own breast. Cast it away!

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.560
<i>- Hallelujah!</i>

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:46.480
Hallelujah.

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.200
Do you think they'll attack tonight?

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:54.120
With Caldwell
leadin' 'em they will.

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:56.960
Look. What's that?

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.200
That's them.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.160
Alarm!

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:07.320
- There goes our barn,
off to the right of those trees.

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.600
- There goes my place.
- No, that's Ritter's.

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:11.520
Then mine's next to it.

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.520
Hold your fire, John. Save your ammunition.
They're just trying to draw us out.

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.880
Back to your place.
Martin's right.

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:35.720
Trust in the Lord, and wait
until you can make every shot count.

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:49.120
You filthy painted heathens.

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.200
Consume them, Lord...

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:54.720
as thou didst thine enemies
in the days of Jeremiah.

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.960
Pastor! Gil! Adam!

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:37.880
- Wait till they're close, men!
- Adam! Here they come!

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:40.520
Ready with those rifles, women!

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:10.400
God have mercy on his soul.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:13.160
I must be shooting
a little to the left.

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:26.200
Here you are, George!
Loaded.

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:30.640
Now shoot the breeches off them,
if they're wearin' breeches. Daisy, come on!

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.040
Loaded.

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.440
Chain shot.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:55.280
Get to the gate!

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:32.720
Call the filthy beggars back.

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.280
We'll wait till the moon sets.

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:40.240
Oh, Barney! Barney,
if you were only here, we'd show 'em.

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:46.080
We'd show-

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:03.160
Hold me up.
I can't breathe... lying down.

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:06.240
- Ah.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.360
Lana, come beside me.

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:13.040
- Give me your hand.

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:16.120
Now don't start tuning out.

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:23.320
I want you and Gil to have
my place- everything.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:26.120
You've been like
my own flesh and blood.

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:28.080
Oh.

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:32.360
Look under the front porch.

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:36.240
I buried... some gold pieces there,
just in case.

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:46.520
Divide it up among
the lot of you.

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:51.560
Gil.

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:59.240
Good-bye, good-lookin'.

01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:05.520
Barney.

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:09.600
Barney!

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.560
- Oh!

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:18.320
For thine is the kingdom...

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.760
the power and the glory...

01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.760
forever.

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:25.960
- Amen.

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.400
How's the ammunition, Parson?

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:31.640
Mighty low.

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:35.120
Ammunition's mighty low, Lord.

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:38.360
- I go Fort Dayton for help.

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.280
<i>- That's a job for me.
- No, I'll go.</i>

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.800
I know every foot of the way.
Anybody can make it, I can.

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.800
Joe.

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:54.960
Joe.

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:02.520
Parson, do you mind?
He'll need it.

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.800
Oneida Trail, huh, Joe?

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.800
Good luck, Joe.

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:16.240
He got away.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.400
Listen.

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:36.920
Adam!

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:28.200
That's shooting, Adam!

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.440
You filthy murderers!
Just leave him-

01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:59.560
God, our merciful father...

01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:01.720
forgive me for what
I am about to-

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.800
Amen.

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.200
Get away. I'm all right.

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:17.360
Gil.

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:21.360
What about-
Somebody's-

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:28.680
I'm going, Parson.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.160
Good luck, Gil.

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:42.040
- Joe, did he-
- He did not.

01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:06.720
- I'm gonna try it myself, Lana.
- Gil.

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.200
If I can make the woods,
I can outrun 'em.

01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:12.080
They'll kill you.

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.800
You're not going to be afraid, you hear?
You're not going to.

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.760
- They'll kill you.
- No, they won't.

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:20.400
If I can get in the clear, there isn't
an Indian living that can catch me.

01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:24.680
Say you're not afraid
and you want me to go.

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:30.040
Lana.

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:37.280
I'm not afraid.
I want you to go.

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:39.800
Lana, he got away.

01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:53.440
Let 'em start.

01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:22.520
Any sign of them yet?

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:25.880
Blue Back says it's quiet-
too quiet out there.

01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:33.440
He left before sunrise.
It's almost 12:00 now.

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:37.080
If he had reached Fort Dayton,
help would be here by now.

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.640
<i>Parson! They're over the wall!</i>

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:50.200
<i>- Every man to his post!</i>

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:24.800
Pull!

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:03.880
Have you seen Lana?

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:05.920
No, I ain't, Gil.

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:35.720
Parson, have you seen Lana?

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.360
I killed a man.

01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:01.840
- Lana. Lana.

01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:06.160
It's me. It's Gil.

01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:08.120
Oh.

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.480
Where's Caldwell?

01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:28.080
- Where's Caldwell?

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.120
Where's Caldwell?

01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:57.120
- Come on! Hey!

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:39.520
Squad left!

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:42.160
March!

01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:44.360
Company halt!

01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:46.480
- Order arms!

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:48.680
- At ease.
- Where are you men going?

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:50.640
- Home.
- Home?

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:56.120
The war's over. Cornwallis surrendered
to Washington at Yorktown last week.

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:06.640
So that's our new flag,
the thing we've been fighting for.

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:09.200
Thirteen stripes for the colonies...

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:11.960
and 13 stars in a circle
for the union.

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:15.800
It's a pretty flag, isn't it?

01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:17.760
Hey, soldier,
let me take that flag a minute.

01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:21.840
- We did a little fightin' around here ourselves.

01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:24.040
<i>- Way up high.
- Put it up there!</i>

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:28.520
<i>- Way up to the top!
- Take it up!</i>

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:31.200
<i>- Put it up there!</i>

01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:51.800
Well, I reckon we better
be gettin' back to work.

01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:54.440
There's gonna be a heap
to do from now on.
