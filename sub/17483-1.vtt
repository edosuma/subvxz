00:30.114 --> 00:31.572
- Wasn't that something?
- That was great.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.116
- Great class.
- Yeah.

00:34.410 --> 00:35.576
Goodnight, Amber.

00:35.703 --> 00:36.911
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:23.639 --> 04:26.307
Oh God, Marvin...ha!

04:26.433 --> 04:28.059
Don't do that.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.357
Come on.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.526
You're looking like
a pro, Laura.

04:37.653 --> 04:39.779
Ah, I'll settle for the workout.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.157
You're the last one out.
Make sure you lock up.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.325
Okay.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.827
- See you.
- See you.

04:46.954 --> 04:47.954
Bye.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.808
Oh...

06:34.102 --> 06:36.520
Oh...oh...Help!

06:36.646 --> 06:42.943
Help! Help!

06:44.529 --> 06:46.405
Please, help!

06:46.531 --> 06:48.074
Help! Help!

06:48.200 --> 06:50.993
Help! Oh...uh...

07:12.432 --> 07:14.517
[TV] Here you are.

07:14.643 --> 07:15.726
Hey, Paulie.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.645
Would you ever sign
one of them for us?

07:17.771 --> 07:19.396
Oh, come on, shake.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.445
Ah!

08:19.499 --> 08:23.711
Dr. Davis, telephone, please.
Dr. Davis, telephone, please.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.429
Excuse me.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.182
Are you looking
for Laura Danvers?

08:36.308 --> 08:37.433
I'm Dr. Southern.

08:37.558 --> 08:38.726
My name is Michael Evans.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.352
I'm the owner of the
health club where Laura works,

08:40.477 --> 08:41.979
where the accident happened.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.654
Fortunately, it's not
as bad as it looks.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.831
But she has sustained burns
over portions of her body.

09:00.957 --> 09:01.582
Burns?

09:01.708 --> 09:03.751
Yes.
Chemical burns.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.295
Chlorine vapor, to be exact.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.047
It's low grade.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.199
Hey.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.432
Never work without
a spotter, Freddy.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.475
The weight falls on you chest

10:01.601 --> 10:03.435
- and you can really get squashed.
- Oh.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.229
I better take a bit of this off.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.106
Ah, that's cool.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.899
This might be
a little bit much, but...

10:11.278 --> 10:13.279
Us powerlifters like to
pump real iron.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.451
Hey Marv, thanks for checking
out the new diving board for me.

10:19.577 --> 10:20.577
I really appreciate it.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.079
Marv...

10:23.581 --> 10:24.832
- Did you try it out yet?
- No, not yet.

10:24.958 --> 10:25.749
I will later today.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.001
Be careful.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.711
Uh, it's too late.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.214
Yeah, nice work, Marv.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.591
I specialize in isometric
crisis training.

10:34.718 --> 10:37.720
Freddie, why don't you show
Darla some powerlifting methods?

10:37.846 --> 10:40.055
I think you're the perfect
person to get her going.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.016
Hey, no problem.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.520
So, where do you
want to begin?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.397
Well, that depends.

10:48.523 --> 10:49.857
Well, lets try this one.

10:51.568 --> 10:52.985
I got it, Freddie.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.320
I got it.

11:09.127 --> 11:11.378
I think we should
help these people.

11:12.088 --> 11:16.216
What do you say we
increase the resistance?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.388
I love it.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.223
What fun?

11:27.187 --> 11:30.731
Hmm, now there's something
even I can't improve upon.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.324
Can we see the manager?

11:40.450 --> 11:41.033
Hello.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.534
I'm Priscilla Wayne,
the manager.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.452
Can I help you?

11:43.578 --> 11:44.953
Lt. Fletcher, LAPD.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.497
Detective Stone.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.749
We have an appointment
with Mr. Evans.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.543
Would you like
something to drink first?

11:51.669 --> 11:52.461
No, thanks.

11:52.587 --> 11:53.587
Yeah, coffee.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.172
All right.

11:55.298 --> 11:58.008
Laura, one cup of
carob coffee, please.

12:03.681 --> 12:04.598
Here you are.

12:04.724 --> 12:05.849
Right this way.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.937
Quite an impressive layout
you have here, Ms. Wayne.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.522
It's a very
competitive business.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.607
It's these extras that
bring in the clientele.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.442
And a little gassing
here and there?

12:19.864 --> 12:21.532
Ooh...

12:21.658 --> 12:23.117
You call this coffee?

12:23.410 --> 12:25.452
She was rescued by
city paramedics.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.621
When they get called,
we get called.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.039
It was an accident.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.333
Yeah, but this accident
nearly dissolved a girl,

12:31.459 --> 12:32.626
like an Alka Seltzer.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.254
Are you making any charges?
I'm Mr. Evans' attorney.

12:36.339 --> 12:37.798
Ms. Wayne mentioned
the computer.

12:37.924 --> 12:38.966
It runs the spa?

12:39.092 --> 12:40.467
The computer helps us
run the spa.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.844
The system is
unique to Starbody.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.804
It controls all the
automatic functions.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.264
Who installed the computer?

12:45.390 --> 12:48.767
Mike, you don't have to
answer these questions.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.686
My programmer is
my brother-in-law.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.479
My former brother-in-law,
David Avery.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.689
Where is he?

12:53.815 --> 12:55.399
Probably in the computer room.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.151
Can we take a look?

12:59.362 --> 13:01.155
Michael, how is Laura?

13:01.281 --> 13:02.781
Less than wonderful.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.498
Who has access to
this command center?

13:11.624 --> 13:12.166
I do.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.668
And David and Priscilla.
But it's David's baby.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.670
What do you mean by
former brother-in-law?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.172
My wife is dead.

13:24.095 --> 13:25.220
Good morning, Michael.
Sleep well?

13:25.346 --> 13:26.847
We have visitors, David.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.557
Lt. Fletcher, LAPD.

13:28.683 --> 13:30.184
Tell him what you know
about last night.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.812
I've been running
all the programs.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.981
There's no breakdown anywhere.

13:36.107 --> 13:39.443
Could someone have
reprogrammed it temporarily?

13:39.569 --> 13:42.404
It's not impossible, but you're
looking at the only someone

13:42.530 --> 13:45.157
who knows the system well enough
not to leave muddy footprints.

13:45.283 --> 13:46.825
Well, that sort of
narrows it down to you,

13:46.951 --> 13:49.203
then, doesn't it?

13:49.329 --> 13:50.787
Were I interested in
a life of crime

13:50.914 --> 13:52.247
would be in computer espionage,

13:52.373 --> 13:56.126
electronic blackmail,
and credit card fraud.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.337
Assaulting women isn't my style.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.967
Where were you last night
between 9 and 11 ?

14:04.093 --> 14:05.385
At home, hacking.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.220
Hacking?

14:06.346 --> 14:07.721
Hacking.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.765
Experimenting with
computer programs.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.308
Are you sure?

14:20.652 --> 14:22.903
These are the computer
printouts from last night.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.655
You will notice the time, date,
and terminal number

14:24.781 --> 14:26.907
on the upper left-hand
corner of each sheet.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.911
Will that suffice?

14:32.163 --> 14:33.080
I'll check it out.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.249
I'd like those back
when you've done, Miss.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.920
Sergeant.

15:10.285 --> 15:11.952
Ah!

15:15.123 --> 15:15.789
It just came off.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.457
- The board came loose.
- Hey, somebody help!

15:20.044 --> 15:21.628
There's been an accident.
Get in here quick.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.591
Darla...

15:26.843 --> 15:27.801
Thanks.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.177
- The board--
- Are you all right?

15:29.304 --> 15:31.930
It just came loose,
sprung off it,

15:32.056 --> 15:33.432
nearly hit me on the way down.

15:33.558 --> 15:36.101
How does a goddamn diving
board just break loose?

15:36.227 --> 15:37.477
Stone.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.395
Are you all right?

15:38.521 --> 15:40.314
- Ah...
- Look at me.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.399
Somebody messed with the bolts.

15:42.525 --> 15:44.818
That's just speculation.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.820
You don't mind if
we dust for prints,

15:46.946 --> 15:48.488
do you, counselor?

15:50.825 --> 15:53.201
Shh. It's all right.
It's okay.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.054
A word, David.

16:12.180 --> 16:13.513
Can we keep it to that?

16:15.266 --> 16:17.100
You're here because
you know the system

16:17.226 --> 16:18.602
and because you're
Catherine's brother.

16:18.728 --> 16:21.730
Both circumstances must be
terribly trying for you.

16:21.856 --> 16:24.024
If I thought for one moment that
you put chlorine in the steams--

16:24.150 --> 16:26.735
You'd resort to the only weapon
in your pathetic arsenal.

16:26.861 --> 16:27.944
Jock violence.

16:28.071 --> 16:29.905
I think there's a glitch
in your precious system.

16:30.031 --> 16:31.698
That's impossible.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.327
Why are you so full of hate?

16:35.453 --> 16:38.705
You found some comfort
for your sorrow, I noticed.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.957
But then Laura was always
there for you, wasn't she?

16:41.084 --> 16:43.377
She and others. Huh?

16:45.838 --> 16:48.298
I loved Catherine.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.133
She never wanted that child.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.718
How do you get things
so twisted up?

16:51.844 --> 16:54.888
We shared thoughts
you'd never understand.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.559
Twins...you know?

17:16.953 --> 17:18.453
I just heard about
the diving board.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.579
What the hell is
going on around here?

17:20.707 --> 17:22.332
So, what do you think?

17:23.667 --> 17:24.876
I think they ought to
give you a roll big enough

17:25.002 --> 17:25.669
to hold the damn chili.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.338
No, about the
Starbody Health Spa.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.218
I think they ought
to level the place.

17:33.344 --> 17:37.305
You think this
Evans guy is clean, huh?

17:37.432 --> 17:38.432
I don't know.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.185
My money is on the wacko
in the computer room.

17:45.106 --> 17:48.066
I don't see David clambering up
there and unbolting that board.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.651
This all could be coincidental.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.278
It could be.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.750
37 deep.

18:04.876 --> 18:06.126
You got it.

18:08.379 --> 18:09.629
What quarter is it?

18:09.756 --> 18:11.465
That was the winning touchdown.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.257
Great.

18:12.383 --> 18:14.801
Flea market special,
two for the price of one.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.178
I figured I could be
Tweedledee

18:16.304 --> 18:18.180
and you could be Tweedledum

18:18.306 --> 18:19.556
Fantastic.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.476
I'm going to check out
that diving board.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.144
Marv...

18:24.353 --> 18:25.729
Thanks.

18:27.899 --> 18:31.610
Did you read the printout on
that Evans guy? About his wife?

18:33.154 --> 18:35.280
Made the front page
of the Times.

18:35.406 --> 18:36.490
She crisped herself.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.159
She was burned to
unrecognizable ashes.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.578
Now, does that suggest
anything to you?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.706
Yeah.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.958
I've got to tell my wife
to start smoking in bed.

19:41.389 --> 19:42.472
Race you to the finish.

19:42.598 --> 19:43.807
You got it.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.399
Mike, I just figured out
what was bothering me

19:52.525 --> 19:54.568
about Laura's accident.

19:54.694 --> 19:55.443
When I left the club,

19:55.570 --> 19:58.071
I know Laura was the
only one left in the place.

19:58.197 --> 19:58.822
So?

19:58.948 --> 20:01.616
Well, how did Priscilla
happen to find her?

20:01.742 --> 20:03.535
Maybe she was working late
and you missed her.

20:03.661 --> 20:06.663
Then I also missed her car
in the parking lot?

20:06.789 --> 20:09.291
You think Priscilla has
something to do with this?

20:09.417 --> 20:11.418
You know her better than I do.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.014
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.557
Well, how many reps
can you do?

20:25.683 --> 20:27.934
Uh, 15 or 20.
More if I'm showing off.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.352
Well, why don't you
show off for me?

20:29.478 --> 20:31.646
I never waste effort
in the gym.

20:31.772 --> 20:33.982
Besides I'm Beta,
you're VHS.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.069
Hey, hop aboard.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.905
We're due to make land
in a week.

20:40.031 --> 20:40.947
Thanks.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.158
We're like two ships
that pass in the night.

20:43.284 --> 20:44.618
And one...

20:45.828 --> 20:47.495
And one, bounce it out.

20:52.043 --> 20:54.461
And one, come on now.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.426
All the way down.

21:01.552 --> 21:03.053
Come on, stretch it out.

21:04.347 --> 21:05.847
To the side, one...

21:08.726 --> 21:10.101
And up.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.687
Then back and up.
Here we go.

21:12.813 --> 21:15.231
And up and back, come on.

21:15.358 --> 21:17.567
Up and back.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.319
How about a vegi shake,
Rhonda.

21:19.445 --> 21:19.861
Sure.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.363
I mean, it's kind of
creepy and all.

21:21.489 --> 21:23.198
On Monday,
Laura gets gassed

21:23.324 --> 21:26.868
and on Tuesday,
the diving board collapses.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.828
Oh, this thing.

21:28.955 --> 21:29.871
Ah!

21:29.997 --> 21:31.247
Oh my God.

21:31.374 --> 21:34.376
Ha, I got you.
It's just a tomato.

21:34.502 --> 21:35.502
That's sick.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.128
Here's your shake.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.800
Uh, sorry.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.677
I lost my appetite.

21:49.642 --> 21:54.521
Back and forth, come on.
Yeah, that's it, all right.

21:57.358 --> 21:59.025
Up in the air.
Yes, come on.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.527
Good jumping today.

22:00.653 --> 22:01.945
All right.

22:03.072 --> 22:04.322
All right. Let's do
the combination,

22:04.448 --> 22:05.824
center floor, first group.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.450
Come on.

22:09.620 --> 22:10.829
Yeah.

22:48.159 --> 22:50.577
What's with the
goddamn bird's nest?

22:50.703 --> 22:53.038
It's a pretty sick joke
considering she's your sister.

22:53.164 --> 22:54.581
What are you talking about?

22:54.707 --> 22:55.373
Whatever you're trying to pull,

22:55.499 --> 22:57.917
you're not going to
get away with it.

22:58.044 --> 23:01.087
You know, Michael,
you need medical attention.

23:03.132 --> 23:05.091
Just watch yourself

23:05.217 --> 23:07.635
or you're going to need
medical attention.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.646
What are you wearing
for Mardi Gras?

23:18.773 --> 23:21.483
Do you think Snow White
might be pressing my luck?

23:25.154 --> 23:29.657
Hey, turn the
goddamn lights back on.

23:29.784 --> 23:31.451
Ooh, not bad, honey.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.703
Can you get us some
men in here, too?

23:55.893 --> 23:57.227
Ah! Ah!

23:57.353 --> 24:09.823
Ah!

24:12.284 --> 24:14.160
Ah! Ah!

24:21.627 --> 24:23.086
Are you two all right?

24:24.380 --> 24:25.672
Yeah, but to tell you
the truth, Michael,

24:25.798 --> 24:28.258
this place could use
better maintenance.

24:28.384 --> 24:31.177
Yeah, who needs weight
reduction through terror?

24:31.303 --> 24:32.846
I'm sorry about the showers.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.472
I want to extend your
memberships for three months,

24:34.598 --> 24:36.099
no charge.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.768
Drop by my office and I'll
take care of it personally.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.395
Do you think you can
handle both of us

24:40.521 --> 24:43.356
after jazz class tomorrow?

24:43.482 --> 24:45.817
Well, I can sure
have fun trying.

24:47.278 --> 24:48.695
Alright,
I'll see you tomorrow.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.701
What's it look like in there?

24:54.827 --> 24:56.703
It's calming down.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.204
Darla's cut isn't serious

24:58.330 --> 24:59.747
and Marci should be
out in a second.

24:59.874 --> 25:02.250
She's pretty shaken up,
but she's going to be all right.

25:02.376 --> 25:04.794
Why did you come back to the
club the night Laura got hurt?

25:06.297 --> 25:08.423
I forgot my purse.

25:08.549 --> 25:09.883
Lucky for her you did.

25:14.221 --> 25:15.430
Ahoy there.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.807
How's it going, Freddie?

25:23.731 --> 25:25.398
- Hello, Robert.
- Sparta.

25:27.318 --> 25:29.986
Resistance is set
at 1 20 pounds.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.614
Anyone seen the white whale?

25:42.124 --> 25:44.542
Increase to 1 30 pounds.

25:46.921 --> 25:49.130
Increase to 140 pounds.

25:50.090 --> 25:51.799
Increase to 1 50 pounds...

25:51.926 --> 25:54.385
Help...come here, somebody!

25:54.511 --> 25:55.762
Help me!

25:55.888 --> 25:57.347
Help!

25:57.473 --> 25:59.224
- Let go of it!
- I can't!

25:59.350 --> 26:02.185
Increase to 350 pounds...
Increase to 360 pounds...

26:02.311 --> 26:06.356
Ugh...ugh...

26:13.572 --> 26:15.657
Tom, the guy is
torn to pieces.

26:17.243 --> 26:18.660
You put those
machines on manual

26:18.786 --> 26:21.663
and you're going to end
what's unique about the club.

26:21.789 --> 26:24.040
The computer had nothing
to do with the accident.

26:24.166 --> 26:25.458
That system of yours
means more to you

26:25.584 --> 26:26.793
than people's lives,
doesn't it?

26:26.919 --> 26:28.711
This system is a marvel.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.964
It made the club a success.

26:31.090 --> 26:34.259
You can't blame the computer for
tiles flying off shower walls.

26:34.385 --> 26:37.595
The computer doesn't
control tiles for Christ's sake.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.389
All right, all right, all right.

26:41.183 --> 26:44.936
Mike, the other partners and
I agree that it is vital that

26:45.062 --> 26:47.480
nothing ruin the success of the
Mardi Gras party Saturday night.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.983
I mean, we had a 20%  increase
in membership last year

26:50.109 --> 26:50.733
due to that party.

26:50.859 --> 26:53.361
Now, you put these
machines on manual

26:53.487 --> 26:55.321
and half the stuff
isn't going to work.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.075
I say we shut the
system down now.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.122
I'll make a bargain with you.

27:04.248 --> 27:05.665
The day after the party,

27:05.791 --> 27:07.208
you want to shut down
the whole damn club

27:07.334 --> 27:09.836
for remodeling,
I'll back you 100% .

27:09.962 --> 27:12.005
That won't be necessary.

27:13.382 --> 27:14.173
Mike, it's going to be okay.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.259
You got to trust me
on this one, buddy.

27:17.803 --> 27:18.344
All right.

27:18.470 --> 27:19.429
Aren't you supposed to
be picking up Laura

27:19.555 --> 27:21.097
at the hospital?

27:21.974 --> 27:23.599
Come on, let's go.
Come on.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.535
Hmm, sure beats hospital food.

28:28.582 --> 28:30.416
Oh, thank you, sir.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.796
Hmm, that's not fair.
I can't see a kiss coming.

28:42.346 --> 28:44.972
I may never take
these bandages off.

28:46.934 --> 28:49.102
I want you to
move in with me.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.978
Only on one condition.

28:51.105 --> 28:53.189
What?

28:53.315 --> 28:56.275
We take a drive by the club
so I can pick up my things.

28:59.696 --> 29:00.988
See you, have fun.

29:01.115 --> 29:02.615
What are you doing tonight?
You want to come with us?

29:02.741 --> 29:03.950
- Yeah.
- Goodnight.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.159
- What time?
- Oh, about an hour or so.

29:05.285 --> 29:06.202
See you later.

29:06.328 --> 29:06.994
I'll come over
and pick you up.

29:07.121 --> 29:08.621
- I'll meet you.
- Okay, great.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.456
- See you. Bye-bye.
- See you later.

29:11.458 --> 29:12.834
They're going to
lock you in, Marci.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.002
Don't worry about me.
I'll get out.

30:01.091 --> 30:03.176
Ah!

30:12.227 --> 30:13.686
Ow...

30:13.812 --> 30:15.646
I'm not much help
to you, am I?

30:16.440 --> 30:20.026
Do you see the one with
number 22 on the door?

30:20.819 --> 30:22.653
Oh yes, here.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.202
Okay.

30:29.328 --> 30:30.328
Give me a minute
to get to my office

30:30.454 --> 30:31.913
so I can turn the
security lock off

30:32.039 --> 30:32.747
and then you can open.

30:32.873 --> 30:34.832
I'm not going anywhere.

31:51.410 --> 32:04.797
Michael?

32:32.909 --> 32:34.118
Who is it?

32:34.953 --> 32:36.162
Michael?

32:36.288 --> 32:37.330
Hi, Michael.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.165
How do you like my costume?

32:39.291 --> 32:41.042
Bad taste, Darla.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.744
Whenever I'm in the club

33:16.870 --> 33:18.537
and even sometimes
when I'm in this house,

33:18.664 --> 33:20.956
I feel a presence.

33:21.083 --> 33:22.708
It's Catherine.

33:23.752 --> 33:26.504
Even in death,
she still has a hold on you.

33:26.630 --> 33:28.506
I feel like she's
reaching out somehow

33:28.632 --> 33:30.800
and causing all this trouble.

33:30.926 --> 33:33.094
It's the dreams,
the accidents,

33:33.220 --> 33:35.554
and those messages
on my computer.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.684
I don't know.

33:39.810 --> 33:41.352
Goodnight, sweetheart.

33:54.199 --> 33:55.616
This cigarette case

33:55.742 --> 33:57.785
was found in the rubble
of the mansion

33:57.911 --> 34:01.330
in upstate New York that
burnt to the ground

34:01.456 --> 34:05.918
under mysterious circumstances
at the turn of the century.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.587
It belonged to the
matriarch of the family

34:08.714 --> 34:10.047
who had come over from Europe

34:10.172 --> 34:12.425
in the middle 1 7th century

34:12.551 --> 34:15.844
and built the first
house on the site.

34:15.971 --> 34:23.393
Oh, she was murdered by
her youngest daughter,

34:23.520 --> 34:26.731
beheaded with an ax.

34:26.857 --> 34:31.902
Four subsequent houses
have burned to the ground.

34:32.027 --> 34:34.739
There is no longer a house.

34:34.864 --> 34:39.452
The present owner has tried to
farm the land on which it stood

34:39.578 --> 34:43.496
but nothing will grow.

34:43.623 --> 34:48.418
It is a barren,
dead piece of earth.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.801
Cigarette?

34:58.430 --> 35:00.014
I don't smoke.

35:09.816 --> 35:12.902
What I've just demonstrated
is called psychometry,

35:13.028 --> 35:15.780
the ability to acquire,
while in contact with an object,

35:15.906 --> 35:17.865
paranormal knowledge
of its history

35:17.991 --> 35:20.785
or facts about its present
or previous owners.

35:20.911 --> 35:22.995
How does this all help me?

35:23.121 --> 35:25.498
You did bring an object
belonging to your late wife,

35:25.624 --> 35:27.333
Mr. Evans?

35:30.879 --> 35:33.297
Ah, Catherine.

35:35.008 --> 35:39.053
Ah, and a beautiful
marriage it was, too,

35:39.179 --> 35:43.682
until she went into labor
with your child

35:43.809 --> 35:48.020
and something happened
to her lower spine,

35:48.146 --> 35:51.106
a cripple growing
progressively more bitter

35:51.233 --> 35:53.275
and depressed.

35:53.401 --> 35:55.361
Jealous, too. Of you?

35:55.487 --> 35:57.613
Without justification.

35:57.739 --> 35:59.782
After she lost the baby,
I couldn't reason with her.

35:59.908 --> 36:03.953
And then, one day,
she went into the garden,

36:04.079 --> 36:09.208
doused herself with gasoline
and set herself on fire,

36:09.334 --> 36:13.087
burned to unrecognizable ashes.

36:13.213 --> 36:16.298
All of which was in
the news a year ago.

36:19.845 --> 36:22.096
You're going to have to do
better than that, Dr. Moray.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.015
Ah...

36:37.863 --> 36:40.281
A bird's nest.

36:40.407 --> 36:42.199
That's what she thought
of your family,

36:42.325 --> 36:44.118
like a bird building its nest,

36:44.244 --> 36:46.036
the mama bird,
the papa bird,

36:46.162 --> 36:47.746
and the baby.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.501
Then why would
she kill herself?

36:54.296 --> 36:56.714
You work in this
business long enough,

36:56.840 --> 36:58.591
you see things.

37:00.385 --> 37:03.596
After she died, I didn't
give a damn about anything.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.640
Laura came along, pulled me
out of it, but it just--

37:06.766 --> 37:09.518
But afraid to build
another nest.

37:09.644 --> 37:11.145
Exactly.

37:11.271 --> 37:17.610
But now, you think that your
late wife is trying to kill you?

37:17.736 --> 37:21.363
Well...somebody could be
trying to drive me crazy.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.324
For what purpose?

37:23.450 --> 37:26.660
My brother-in-law,
Catherine's twin.

37:26.786 --> 37:28.621
He hates my guts.

37:28.747 --> 37:31.332
Hmm.

37:31.458 --> 37:34.418
Why don't I come
down to your club?

37:34.544 --> 37:38.213
You can say I'm an
insurance investigator.

37:38.340 --> 37:39.924
You need one.

37:41.968 --> 37:43.719
I'll hang around
until after closing

37:43.845 --> 37:45.512
and see what I can find out.

37:45.639 --> 37:47.973
Do you need me for anything?

37:48.099 --> 37:50.768
One of the reasons that
I left the seminary

37:50.894 --> 37:52.770
for parapsychology,
Mr. Evans,

37:52.896 --> 37:56.315
was the desire to separate
true spiritual phenomena

37:56.441 --> 37:59.318
from fraudulent deception.

38:02.280 --> 38:08.577
There is more to this job than
things that go beep and buzz.

38:13.166 --> 38:14.667
I'll see you at
the club tonight.

38:39.067 --> 38:41.527
You love me, don't you?

38:41.653 --> 38:44.196
I can't do this anymore.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.115
Catherine, we're hurting people.

38:46.241 --> 38:47.700
Yes, you can.

38:49.119 --> 38:49.910
No.

38:51.121 --> 38:57.835
[moaning]

39:03.466 --> 39:06.552
There, that's better.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.721
They're so weak,

39:08.847 --> 39:12.349
and together we are
so strong.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.615
Mr. Evans, a woman
named Marci Hewitt,

39:28.742 --> 39:30.451
a member of your
club is missing.

39:30.577 --> 39:32.077
- Marci?
- Yeah.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.163
Her boyfriend said he
hadn't seen her for two days.

39:34.289 --> 39:36.081
The last he knew she
was going to your club.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.500
Her car was found abandoned in
the neighborhood this morning.

39:38.626 --> 39:41.712
I haven't seen Marci
at least for two days.

39:41.838 --> 39:44.256
What a fantastic
weight reduction program.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.091
People get so thin,
they disappear.

39:59.856 --> 40:01.148
How's the investigation going?

40:01.274 --> 40:02.566
It's going.

40:03.526 --> 40:04.610
Hi, Michael.

40:04.736 --> 40:05.903
Ready to make good
on your promise?

40:06.029 --> 40:06.779
Of course.

40:06.905 --> 40:07.946
Okay, we'll see you
in an hour then.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.198
- All right.
- Okay?

40:09.324 --> 40:10.532
Linda, come on.

40:12.118 --> 40:13.368
The security system
will be off at night,

40:13.495 --> 40:15.120
so you can roam about freely.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.080
Fine.

40:16.206 --> 40:16.955
Enjoy the evening.

40:17.082 --> 40:18.165
Fine.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.009
[crosstalk]

40:42.273 --> 40:45.400
Linda.

40:47.195 --> 40:48.487
Here's a note for you.

40:52.242 --> 40:54.201
You know, what do
you need, a raise?

40:54.327 --> 40:55.744
No.

41:02.293 --> 41:03.418
Almost ready?

41:03.545 --> 41:05.671
Actually, it's so late.
I've got to run.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.006
Do you think you can
handle Michael for both of us?

41:08.133 --> 41:09.925
- With pleasure.
- Okay.

41:13.096 --> 41:14.680
Hey, let me borrow
your hairspray.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.184
Yeah, here. Okay.

42:46.689 --> 43:02.120
Michael?

43:05.208 --> 43:06.625
Michael, are you here?

43:27.814 --> 43:29.773
This isn't funny, Michael.

43:32.402 --> 43:33.777
I'm leaving.

43:33.987 --> 43:35.612
Ah!

43:36.322 --> 43:37.406
What is it?

43:37.532 --> 43:39.074
Turn it off!

43:43.454 --> 43:46.456
Ah!

43:52.130 --> 43:53.422
Oh, my head!

43:55.425 --> 43:56.758
Oh...

44:03.558 --> 44:04.766
Help!

44:06.644 --> 44:08.437
Help me!

44:08.563 --> 44:10.439
Ah! Help!

44:13.818 --> 44:15.235
It's burning!

44:24.245 --> 44:25.662
My eyes!

44:28.249 --> 44:31.501
Ah! Ah! Ah!

44:31.794 --> 44:33.086
Michael?

44:33.212 --> 44:34.921
Did you forget your keys?

44:37.300 --> 44:38.925
Laura, it's David.

44:39.927 --> 44:41.511
David?

44:42.930 --> 44:44.681
What's wrong?

44:44.807 --> 44:45.849
Michael asked me
to drop by

44:45.975 --> 44:47.976
and check out
the home terminal.

44:48.102 --> 44:50.187
One of the programs
keeps hanging.

44:52.398 --> 44:55.359
He never said anything to me
about you coming by.

44:55.485 --> 44:57.569
He's had a lot on
his mind lately.

45:05.953 --> 45:08.038
Laura, it's nice to see you.

45:09.791 --> 45:12.542
I was so sorry to hear
about your accident.

45:13.461 --> 45:14.753
Thank you.

45:17.673 --> 45:20.467
Well, I know my
way to the study.

45:46.285 --> 45:49.329
Wasn't it sweet of Michael
to bring you here?

45:49.455 --> 45:50.747
Yes.

45:50.873 --> 45:52.290
Yes, it was.

45:53.459 --> 45:55.085
It was nice.

45:58.089 --> 46:00.632
How strange for him though

46:00.758 --> 46:04.010
having a woman here so soon
after my sister's passing.

46:05.555 --> 46:08.598
That...That was over
a year ago, David.

46:12.019 --> 46:14.104
It was that long ago,
wasn't it?

46:16.607 --> 46:19.734
A man must get on with
the business of living.

46:19.861 --> 46:21.987
How long will you be?

46:22.113 --> 46:23.822
Do I make you nervous?

46:26.242 --> 46:28.660
David, I know you have
some kind of crazy idea

46:28.786 --> 46:30.620
that Michael
and I were involved

46:30.746 --> 46:33.290
while Catherine was still alive,

46:33.416 --> 46:35.292
but that couldn't be more false.

46:35.418 --> 46:37.461
Laura, I'm deeply hurt.

46:41.090 --> 46:44.342
I have no such suspicions.

46:44.469 --> 46:46.970
And I really liked your sister

46:47.096 --> 46:48.472
even when she was
so mean to me.

46:48.598 --> 46:49.806
I know.

46:51.434 --> 46:53.852
Don't. Don't.

46:56.856 --> 46:58.315
I'm sorry.

47:00.234 --> 47:02.319
I guess I just
want to be alone.

47:02.445 --> 47:04.821
I understand, dear.

47:04.947 --> 47:06.531
I really do.

47:12.121 --> 47:14.831
Huh...
Would you please...

47:14.957 --> 47:16.708
Would you please answer it?

47:17.502 --> 47:18.835
Of course.

47:37.313 --> 47:41.233
David, I didn't expect
to see you here.

47:41.359 --> 47:43.860
Michael asked me to drop
by with the groceries.

47:43.986 --> 47:45.654
I'll take care of it.

48:32.702 --> 48:33.910
Have you seen David?

48:34.829 --> 48:36.454
Oh, no.

48:59.437 --> 49:14.618
Laura?

49:16.370 --> 49:17.662
Are you all right?

49:19.081 --> 49:22.167
Sure, just sleeping.

49:26.589 --> 49:28.173
David came by.

49:29.383 --> 49:31.009
David?

49:31.135 --> 49:32.260
What the hell
was he doing here?

49:33.387 --> 49:34.638
Fixing your terminal.

49:36.223 --> 49:38.433
I didn't tell him
to come here.

49:38.559 --> 49:40.560
What's that little
bastard up to?

49:48.444 --> 49:50.153
What is it?

49:50.821 --> 49:52.197
Hmm?

49:53.491 --> 49:55.408
What's wrong?
You're upset.

49:57.536 --> 49:59.496
I saw a parapsychologist today.

50:18.140 --> 50:19.641
God, I am a nervous wreck,
alright?

50:19.767 --> 50:21.142
I'm almost done,
almost done.

50:26.691 --> 50:28.066
Give me a...

50:34.615 --> 50:35.365
Just making sure the computer

50:35.491 --> 50:37.450
no longer controls
the air conditioning.

50:43.332 --> 50:44.749
So, tomorrow night
instead of Mardi Gras,

50:44.875 --> 50:46.710
we're going to have
a summer hothouse.

52:12.129 --> 52:14.714
Huh, huh...

52:37.905 --> 52:39.656
[sinister laughing]

52:47.456 --> 53:04.556
Ah!

53:19.655 --> 53:24.450
Michael?

53:26.287 --> 53:27.787
Michael.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.791
Come to me.

53:31.917 --> 53:34.460
Come to me.
I need you.

53:35.170 --> 53:37.964
It's so easy. Then we can
be together forever.

53:38.090 --> 53:40.967
Jump, jump, jump.

54:06.327 --> 54:07.619
Moray!

54:10.539 --> 54:11.915
Dr. Moray!

54:14.543 --> 54:15.835
Moray!

54:51.956 --> 54:53.957
Tom!
Open up!

54:56.752 --> 54:58.419
- ls that you, Mike?
- Yo.

55:02.883 --> 55:04.467
Morning, Tom, old buddy.

55:10.516 --> 55:11.975
Morning, Mike.

55:14.186 --> 55:15.645
Why all the good cheer?

55:15.771 --> 55:16.771
Why shouldn't I be cheerful?

55:16.897 --> 55:18.022
My club's being sabotaged.

55:18.148 --> 55:20.191
Laura is temporarily blinded

55:20.317 --> 55:23.111
and my lawyer has got the
cutest shorts I've ever seen.

55:24.321 --> 55:26.489
We don't know it's
sabotage, Mike.

55:29.451 --> 55:30.493
Where did you find this?

55:30.619 --> 55:31.411
Do you know that I've been
looking for this watch

55:31.537 --> 55:32.495
for the past two days?

55:32.621 --> 55:33.997
You don't know when
to quit, do you?

55:34.123 --> 55:36.916
Mike, I don't know what finding a
lost watch has to do with any...

55:43.632 --> 55:45.925
Are you helping Tom
destroy our club?

55:46.051 --> 55:46.676
What?

55:46.802 --> 55:49.512
I found his watch this morning
in the utilities room.

55:54.727 --> 55:57.020
Are you involved?

55:57.146 --> 55:58.688
Michael, I was...

55:58.814 --> 56:01.232
Which one of you put the
chlorine in the steam system?

56:01.358 --> 56:03.234
That could have killed Laura.

56:03.360 --> 56:06.487
That steam room door doesn't lock.

56:06.613 --> 56:08.364
She should have been
able to get out.

56:09.658 --> 56:11.993
And Robert?
And the broken diving board?

56:12.119 --> 56:13.870
Those messages
on my computer?

56:16.081 --> 56:18.541
I didn't know anything
about any messages.

56:18.667 --> 56:21.377
Mike, I think the strain
of the last week

56:21.503 --> 56:23.379
has been getting
to you, buddy.

56:26.425 --> 56:27.884
It all fits.

56:28.010 --> 56:28.926
The computer system fouls up.

56:29.053 --> 56:31.888
I take the blame and you
and your partners buy me out.

56:32.014 --> 56:33.890
Who else is in on this?

56:37.686 --> 56:39.729
It's just the two of us.

56:41.273 --> 56:43.524
Michael, I really am sorry.

56:45.736 --> 56:47.820
David isn't involved with you?

56:47.946 --> 56:49.363
No.

56:53.035 --> 56:55.912
Priscilla seems to know
more about this than I do.

57:04.338 --> 57:06.172
Have a nice day.

57:14.389 --> 57:15.056
We could still get the club.

57:15.182 --> 57:17.850
We just need to
adjust the spa's books.

57:19.937 --> 57:22.271
I've known some real pricks,

57:22.397 --> 57:23.940
but you're the king.

57:24.066 --> 57:25.024
Priscilla, baby.

57:25.150 --> 57:26.442
Take it as a compliment.

57:26.568 --> 57:28.694
Just stay the hell
away from me.

57:35.327 --> 57:37.286
We should stop now.

57:37.412 --> 57:39.038
I see their faces.

57:39.164 --> 57:41.624
I hear their screams.
It's horrible.

57:41.750 --> 57:43.417
Their flirtations annoyed me.

57:43.544 --> 57:44.877
I am tired of
waiting for Michael.

57:45.003 --> 57:46.295
No, please.

57:46.421 --> 57:48.297
I can't.
I don't want to.

57:48.423 --> 57:50.758
We've only just begun.

57:50.884 --> 57:55.304
Oh, please, please, no.

57:55.430 --> 57:59.392
No, no!!!

58:20.414 --> 58:21.998
Looking for me?

58:23.292 --> 58:24.667
Have you seen David?

58:24.793 --> 58:25.751
No.

58:25.878 --> 58:27.128
Are you all right?

58:28.755 --> 58:30.006
Have you seen a guy
named Moray?

58:30.132 --> 58:31.340
Who's he?

58:33.385 --> 58:34.010
Come on.

58:35.721 --> 58:37.555
The minute you find David,
I want you to grab him.

58:37.681 --> 58:38.014
What's up?

58:38.140 --> 58:39.515
Just grab him
and sit on him.

58:39.641 --> 58:40.850
Then find me.

58:41.894 --> 58:44.020
I'm stopping his
bullshit right now.

58:45.772 --> 58:47.231
What do we need? Stereo?

58:47.357 --> 58:49.025
- Lights? Security system?
- Yeah.

58:49.151 --> 58:50.318
We have generator
power for that, right?

58:50.444 --> 58:51.485
Right.

58:51.612 --> 58:53.029
I'm putting the
machines on manual.

58:53.155 --> 58:54.697
And that's the end of that.

58:55.199 --> 58:55.865
I like it.

58:55.991 --> 58:57.033
- Here's my ID card
- Yeah.

58:57.159 --> 58:57.700
If David gets in here,

58:57.826 --> 58:59.619
I want you to be able
to get him out.

59:00.621 --> 59:02.330
That thing stays off.

59:02.456 --> 59:03.748
You got it.

59:39.201 --> 59:40.576
I'm going to break in.

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:07.395
Are you sure this guy
still lives here?

01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:15.444
Yeah, he lives here.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.752
He doesn't live here alone.

01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:08.372
Yeah.
Lt. Fletcher, homicide.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:11.083
I want an APB on David Avery.

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:14.378
Male Caucasian,
29-30 years old,

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:15.713
slight build,

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:18.674
about 6 feet tall,
135 pounds,

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.261
reddish blond hair,
probably a psycho.

01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:23.846
Oh, and get this.

01:01:23.972 --> 01:01:26.182
He might be in drag.

01:01:26.308 --> 01:01:27.683
Yeah, right.

01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:33.230
I knew this guy was a wacko.

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:36.275
I'm going to the club.

01:01:39.404 --> 01:01:40.196
Starbody.

01:01:40.322 --> 01:01:41.447
Jeffery, Michael Evans.

01:01:41.573 --> 01:01:42.531
Oh, hi, Michael.

01:01:42.657 --> 01:01:43.657
Has David shown up yet?

01:01:43.784 --> 01:01:45.493
No, no.
I haven't seen him.

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:46.786
Go to the computer
room and stay on guard.

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:49.330
Don't let anybody in
except Marvin and me.

01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:51.749
Tell Marvin to come to the
front desk and watch for David

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:53.793
or anyone that's dressed like...

01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:54.794
like Catherine.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:55.836
What?

01:01:55.962 --> 01:01:57.922
David might be dressed
like his twin sister.

01:01:58.048 --> 01:02:00.508
Just get the message
passed on to him.

01:02:00.634 --> 01:02:01.967
Okay...

01:02:57.691 --> 01:02:59.775
Well, like, I thought he was going
to be here a half-hour ago...

01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:02.194
This place ought to be lousy
with good-lookin' bimbo's.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.948
I'm sure they'll go crazy for
garlic and pepperoni breath.

01:03:08.577 --> 01:03:09.743
Got any gum?

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:15.082
Hey.

01:03:16.418 --> 01:03:17.751
Excuse me.

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:19.295
Sorry. I, uh...

01:03:19.421 --> 01:03:20.713
I thought you were a friend.

01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:26.427
Excuse me.

01:03:26.553 --> 01:03:28.804
Sgt. Stone?
Lt. Fletcher?

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:29.889
Michael should be in
at any moment.

01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:31.807
There's a bar
in the aerobics room.

01:03:42.777 --> 01:03:44.403
Uh...

01:03:45.864 --> 01:03:48.365
Uh...ah.

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:56.624
Excuse me, miss.

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:58.667
Hey, how did you do that?

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:03.297
You know, you're not supposed
to be in the computer room here.

01:04:03.423 --> 01:04:05.925
How did you get in anyway?
The door was locked?

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:11.514
Well, um, maybe you could
stay for a little while.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:14.058
Nice, uh, arms.

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:15.893
Uh...You know,

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:18.729
I really could get in a
lot of trouble for this.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.235
What's your name?

01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:42.294
Ah!

01:04:44.756 --> 01:04:47.967
- Laura, my God, look at you.
- Oh Marvin, hi.

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:50.719
- You look fantastic.
- Oh, put me down.

01:04:50.845 --> 01:04:54.056
Oh God, it's great to
see the world again.

01:04:54.182 --> 01:04:54.890
Where's Michael?

01:04:55.016 --> 01:04:56.475
- He'll be along in a minute.
- Oh, okay.

01:04:56.601 --> 01:04:58.477
Come on, Laura.
Let's go get a drink.

01:04:58.603 --> 01:04:59.520
- See you later.
- All right, see you--

01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:01.480
Did you see that guy?
He looks great.

01:05:02.023 --> 01:05:03.857
Oh...

01:05:03.984 --> 01:05:05.401
Want some of that?

01:05:12.033 --> 01:05:13.617
How's it going, Jeffrey?

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:26.714
So you're okay?

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:29.800
Hi, Jeffrey.

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:34.430
- Where's Laura?
- Headed for the bar.

01:05:34.556 --> 01:05:36.015
- How's her eyes?
- Beautiful.

01:05:36.141 --> 01:05:37.433
Okay, great.

01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:38.767
Priscilla's looking for you.

01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:41.437
Who are you?

01:05:41.563 --> 01:05:42.980
Where are you taking me?

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:08.464
Ha!

01:06:29.444 --> 01:06:31.487
Say goodbye to
your club, Michael.

01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:57.304
- No--
- No.

01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:59.056
[speaking Japanese]

01:07:08.817 --> 01:07:09.608
Need some help?

01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:10.567
Huh?

01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:11.902
I asked if you could use a hand.

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:13.946
Ah, sure. Why don't you
help with these.

01:07:30.422 --> 01:07:32.715
What a hot party, Tom.

01:07:32.841 --> 01:07:33.549
What do you think?

01:07:33.675 --> 01:07:35.384
Yeah, but it's
hotter in the sauna.

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:37.052
What do you say?

01:07:54.654 --> 01:07:56.739
What a shock, poor dear.

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.743
The dead past
returning to haunt you.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:31.648
Hello, Michael.

01:08:32.692 --> 01:08:34.818
Resistance is set at maximum.

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:23.242
Hello, sweetheart.

01:09:23.368 --> 01:09:25.202
Welcome to my party.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.344
Where's Laura?

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.430
Working on her tan.

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:50.018
Careful.

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:53.689
One flick of a button
and she's fried chicken.

01:09:55.984 --> 01:09:57.150
What do you want?

01:09:57.277 --> 01:09:59.987
Haven't you been
getting my messages?

01:10:00.113 --> 01:10:01.947
I'm lonely.

01:10:02.073 --> 01:10:03.782
I want you with me.

01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:07.578
Killing yourself
isn't so hard really.

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:10.414
And besides you'll be
saving all your friends.

01:10:11.916 --> 01:10:14.167
I will destroy this place

01:10:14.294 --> 01:10:16.461
and I'll kill them all

01:10:16.588 --> 01:10:18.672
unless you do as I say.

01:10:28.516 --> 01:10:29.892
Get away from there, Michael.

01:10:38.985 --> 01:10:41.486
Oh, this is a great, Tom.

01:11:03.217 --> 01:11:04.217
Ah...

01:11:05.678 --> 01:11:08.513
Tom!
Ah, ah!

01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:13.602
Ha, ha, ha...

01:11:13.728 --> 01:11:16.521
Oh God! Oh...

01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:19.274
Ah! Ah!

01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:24.571
No!

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:39.378
David?

01:11:40.755 --> 01:11:43.048
Ah...

01:11:46.678 --> 01:11:48.261
David, I need your help.

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:53.475
No!

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:58.021
You have to go the way I did.

01:11:58.147 --> 01:11:59.356
And if you don't,

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:01.692
you're going to
watch Laura burn.

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:03.986
All right.
But let her go first.

01:12:04.112 --> 01:12:06.655
Don't give me ultimatums!

01:12:06.781 --> 01:12:09.491
If you kill her,
you'll never have me.

01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:13.829
You'd kill yourself for her.

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:17.332
You love her that much,
don't you?

01:12:17.458 --> 01:12:18.709
David, fight back.

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:20.544
Ooh.

01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:22.921
No!

01:12:23.047 --> 01:12:24.631
Oh, God.

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:27.884
No!

01:12:28.011 --> 01:12:29.177
Michael.

01:12:29.303 --> 01:12:30.762
No!

01:12:31.389 --> 01:12:32.514
David.

01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:37.185
Ah...

01:12:43.818 --> 01:12:46.820
That weakling
is gone forever.

01:12:46.946 --> 01:12:49.197
And your time is running out.

01:12:50.241 --> 01:12:51.533
No!

01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:06.131
Ugh.

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:03.271
Now is your chance, Michael.

01:14:03.397 --> 01:14:05.107
Come with me into the inferno.

01:14:05.233 --> 01:14:08.068
Let's die together
and live forever in hell.

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:17.285
Uh...

01:14:17.829 --> 01:14:19.162
Marvin...

01:14:21.124 --> 01:14:22.791
What's the matter?
Is he okay?

01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:40.142
Everyone in this place
is going to die.

01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:01.163
We're out of booze here.

01:15:02.707 --> 01:15:04.708
There's more in
the aerobics room.

01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:11.173
You know,
this stuff isn't bad.

01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:13.633
Keeps you skinny, too.

01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:17.846
All it needs is, uh,
a little vodka.

01:15:22.268 --> 01:15:23.685
Now what?

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.231
- Ah!
- Miss.

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:29.482
Why don't you try--

01:15:29.609 --> 01:15:31.610
Ah!

01:15:34.822 --> 01:15:36.573
Give me it...Give me it...

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:38.491
Ah!

01:15:40.328 --> 01:15:41.369
Stone!

01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:44.956
I can't...stop!

01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:46.791
I can't get it off!
It's unplugged!

01:15:46.918 --> 01:15:48.877
Oh, God...

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:50.378
Ah!

01:15:50.504 --> 01:15:51.880
Come on, get off!

01:15:52.006 --> 01:15:53.882
Get off!

01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:55.050
Come on.

01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:56.968
Oh my God.

01:15:57.094 --> 01:15:58.929
No, I can't get it off!

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:00.472
Stone!

01:16:00.598 --> 01:16:02.557
- Somebody!
- Ah!

01:16:02.683 --> 01:16:04.142
Come on, get off!

01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:05.685
Help!

01:16:05.811 --> 01:16:07.771
Jesus Christ, get in here!

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:09.731
Stone!

01:16:09.857 --> 01:16:10.815
Come on...

01:16:10.942 --> 01:16:11.816
I can't...

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:29.417
Oh my God.

01:16:31.879 --> 01:16:33.838
Ah!

01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:35.632
Help, help!

01:16:40.179 --> 01:16:42.347
Ah!

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:47.185
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:16:47.311 --> 01:16:49.145
Ah!

01:16:49.272 --> 01:16:51.064
Help! Help me!

01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:00.156
Ah, help me!

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:03.118
What the fuck?!

01:17:03.244 --> 01:17:05.620
Stop! Ah!

01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:09.958
Somebody help!

01:17:16.549 --> 01:17:17.882
Help!

01:17:18.592 --> 01:17:20.302
Ah!

01:17:37.111 --> 01:17:38.278
Fletcher.

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:58.590
Oh...

01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:00.300
Oh, I feel sick.

01:18:00.426 --> 01:18:02.677
Fletcher.
Are you there?

01:18:03.471 --> 01:18:04.971
Hey, Fletch.

01:18:06.057 --> 01:18:09.434
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

01:18:27.828 --> 01:18:29.037
I got to get to the power.

01:18:29.163 --> 01:18:30.497
Can you walk?

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:49.265
Are you okay?

01:18:50.017 --> 01:18:51.267
I'll survive.

01:18:51.394 --> 01:18:53.061
I'll go get Fletch.

01:18:53.854 --> 01:18:54.854
Fletch...

01:18:55.689 --> 01:18:56.731
Oh...

01:19:23.342 --> 01:19:29.639
Ah!

01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:41.443
Hey.

01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:47.240
Run! Run!

01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:15.935
Alright, bitch.

01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:17.645
I'll show you fried chicken.

01:20:29.116 --> 01:20:30.492
Michael!

01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:34.454
Ah!

01:20:47.968 --> 01:20:48.843
Michael!

01:20:57.686 --> 01:22:07.672
Ah...

01:22:38.078 --> 01:22:39.704
The computer locked it.

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:41.664
Aw, fuck this computer shit.

01:22:47.755 --> 01:22:49.464
What the hell happened?

01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:51.841
It's Catherine.
She took over David's body.

01:22:54.136 --> 01:22:55.762
Oh...oh...

01:22:55.888 --> 01:22:57.013
Wait, wait, wait.

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:00.183
Marvin.

01:23:01.018 --> 01:23:03.478
- Jesus, you finally got it.
- Thank God you're all right.

01:23:24.541 --> 01:23:26.417
Nice try, Michael.

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:39.972
Ah...
