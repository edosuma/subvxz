WEBVTT

00:10.609 --> 00:13.512
So what do you think?

00:13.512 --> 00:16.015
I mean, come on.
I earned this vacation.

00:16.015 --> 00:16.982
You ever been married?

00:16.982 --> 00:18.818
When it's good,
it's great.

00:18.818 --> 00:22.811
And when it's over,
it's even better. Mm-hmm.

00:25.357 --> 00:29.261
I'm telling you, the seven
comes up every six rolls.

00:29.261 --> 00:29.795
I got a system.

00:29.995 --> 00:32.164
You know what
the casinos say

00:32.164 --> 00:33.332
about guys
with systems?

00:33.332 --> 00:34.066
What?

00:34.066 --> 00:35.533
Welcome.

00:36.435 --> 00:38.070
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

00:38.070 --> 00:41.774
Everything you need
to know about craps
is right in this book.

00:41.774 --> 00:42.908
I was talking
to Shirley...

00:42.908 --> 00:44.977
she said the only
way to make money

00:44.977 --> 00:46.638
in that town is slots.

00:49.081 --> 00:51.650
(rock music playing)

00:51.650 --> 00:53.752
I'm up $1,500.

00:53.752 --> 00:55.154
That's nice, dear.

00:55.154 --> 00:56.622
Oh, I found
the pictures.

00:56.622 --> 00:58.357
Look at this.
(gasps)

00:58.357 --> 01:00.860
Oh, look at him.

01:00.860 --> 01:02.851
He's just learning
how to walk.

01:03.195 --> 01:04.864
Here's another one
with his sister.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.398
Oh, there it is.

01:06.398 --> 01:08.067
- You have
a beautiful family. - Thank you.

01:08.067 --> 01:09.134
We've been blessed.

01:09.134 --> 01:12.035
Yeah, we sure
have been blessed.

01:15.140 --> 01:17.810
Well, folks, we just
hit Mountain Pass.

01:17.810 --> 01:21.075
Means we're about 40 miles
outside of Vegas.

01:22.081 --> 01:23.849
Some of you
are going to be

01:23.849 --> 01:24.917
driving back
with me.

01:24.917 --> 01:26.819
Some of you are going
to be flying back

01:26.819 --> 01:29.121
with all the money
you're going to win.

01:29.121 --> 01:30.022
In any case,

01:30.022 --> 01:31.824
you just sit back, relax,

01:31.824 --> 01:34.260
we'll see if we can't
get you there

01:34.260 --> 01:35.818
ahead of schedule.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.402
Hey.

01:43.402 --> 01:45.029
Want a nip?

01:48.207 --> 01:50.334
No. I know my limits.

02:07.626 --> 02:09.762
(tires squealing)

02:09.762 --> 02:12.731
(screaming)

02:19.204 --> 02:21.968
(screaming continues)

02:31.717 --> 02:36.347
)
Garbled radio transmission)

02:44.697 --> 02:46.065
Everybody stand by.

02:46.065 --> 02:47.099
Do not touch this car

02:47.099 --> 02:49.761
until every victim
is off the bus.

03:03.849 --> 03:05.651
I feel so useless.

03:05.651 --> 03:10.179
It's still
a rescue operation.

03:12.124 --> 03:14.727
We're not running
this show.

03:14.727 --> 03:16.695
Yeah. Not yet.

03:23.302 --> 03:25.070
They do their job...

03:25.070 --> 03:26.638
then we do ours.

03:59.538 --> 04:01.840
Okay, you got him there?

04:01.840 --> 04:03.307
Yeah.

04:05.044 --> 04:07.446
Mine are lined up
right over there.

04:07.446 --> 04:08.747
Yeah.

04:08.747 --> 04:10.349
Let me get under.

04:10.349 --> 04:12.718
All right.
There we go.

04:12.718 --> 04:14.953
Walter?

04:14.953 --> 04:17.089
Where's my husband?

04:17.089 --> 04:19.925
Walter!

04:19.925 --> 04:21.493
Walter!

04:21.493 --> 04:22.628
(crying)

04:22.628 --> 04:26.265
All right, I want everybody
thinking worst case scenario.

04:26.265 --> 04:27.666
The highway's finally ours.

04:27.666 --> 04:31.070
Cones and pictures,
skid marks,

04:31.070 --> 04:33.072
ice patches,
loose asphalt...

04:33.072 --> 04:34.406
anything and everything.

04:34.406 --> 04:36.041
- Got it... - It's a pretty wide
area up there.

04:36.041 --> 04:37.042
Are we clear to
call in for help?

04:37.042 --> 04:39.278
Every Las Vegas CSI
is on their way here.

04:39.278 --> 04:40.412
Cadets?

04:40.412 --> 04:41.743
Call them.

04:50.889 --> 05:02.434
(sobbing)

05:02.434 --> 05:05.204
You the only
trauma doc?

05:05.204 --> 05:06.705
That's right.

05:06.705 --> 05:07.940
Lucky me.

05:07.940 --> 05:10.008
I personally
black-tagged six.

05:10.008 --> 05:10.676
Excuse me.

05:10.676 --> 05:13.278
My line of work,
that's a bad night.

05:13.278 --> 05:14.313
Yeah. Mine, too.

05:14.313 --> 05:16.348
That the bus driver
over there?

05:16.348 --> 05:19.651
Big surprise.
Only person

05:19.651 --> 05:20.953
on the bus
wearing a seat-belt.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.121
Only one on a tour bus
required to wear one.

05:22.121 --> 05:22.788
Thank you.

05:22.788 --> 05:24.490
Hey. Got here
as soon as I could.

05:24.490 --> 05:28.894
What are you
doing here, Greg?
All hands on deck.

05:28.894 --> 05:30.729
That was the call, right?
Crims on the scene.

05:30.729 --> 05:32.364
Crims with field training.

05:32.364 --> 05:33.265
Come on.

05:33.265 --> 05:34.633
I'm capable.

05:34.633 --> 05:36.123
He does no collection.

05:39.638 --> 05:40.739
You're taking
my notes.

05:40.739 --> 05:42.774
You didn't bring
a warmer jacket?

05:42.774 --> 05:43.866
No.

05:47.779 --> 05:48.914
Listen, I'll, uh...

05:48.914 --> 05:50.382
I'll do anything
that I can.

05:50.382 --> 05:52.151
I just want to help.
Please.

05:52.151 --> 05:55.454
No, sir, just, uh,
uh, stick around.

05:55.454 --> 05:57.222
I'll be right here.

05:57.222 --> 05:58.157
Thank you.

05:58.157 --> 06:01.558
(siren wailing)

06:03.829 --> 06:05.964
Hey. Uh... Larry Maddox.

06:05.964 --> 06:07.366
Owns the bus company.

06:07.366 --> 06:10.169
Got here quick.
That should tell you something.

06:10.169 --> 06:12.905
Yeah, he coughed up
the passenger manifest,

06:12.905 --> 06:14.873
including the driver,
Martin Draper.

06:14.873 --> 06:17.276
24 passengers, one PAL.

06:17.276 --> 06:19.845
Parolee-at-large.

06:19.845 --> 06:20.946
Calvin McBride. Seat One-C.

06:20.946 --> 06:23.849
California State Pen,
two years, aggravated assault.

06:23.849 --> 06:24.917
He was paroled last week.

06:24.917 --> 06:27.283
And already
over state lines.

06:27.853 --> 06:29.221
It was news
to his parole officer.

06:29.221 --> 06:31.089
I'm sure it was.

06:31.089 --> 06:32.324
You know, my guys
are matching names to faces

06:32.324 --> 06:32.624
both here and at the hospital.

06:32.624 --> 06:36.492
McBride tops the list.
I'm going to talk to Maddox.

06:38.197 --> 06:40.365
Four-point sweep.

06:40.365 --> 06:42.595
Let's roll.

07:00.719 --> 07:04.256
Fire Department says
the driver of the
Camaro is dead.

07:04.256 --> 07:05.090
Yeah, I heard.

07:05.090 --> 07:08.660
But I think I know why
the bus pulled to the right.

07:08.660 --> 07:11.263
Now
that
is a serious blowout.

07:11.263 --> 07:14.333
And the front
left tire's

07:14.333 --> 07:15.601
still intact.

07:15.601 --> 07:17.436
Newton's Third Law:
"For every action

07:17.436 --> 07:20.105
there is an equal
and opposite reaction."

07:20.105 --> 07:21.306
Tire to rim.

07:21.306 --> 07:22.941
Rim to axle.

07:22.941 --> 07:24.876
Axle to suspension.

07:24.876 --> 07:26.545
Suspension to frame.

07:26.545 --> 07:29.248
And the lower radius rod arm...

07:29.248 --> 07:32.251
which connects
the axle to the frame.

07:32.251 --> 07:35.345
Not anymore.

07:37.089 --> 07:41.116
So, if the rod arm broke
while he was driving...

07:41.860 --> 07:44.830
Driver tried
to maintain control.

07:44.830 --> 07:46.164
Veered to the left.

07:46.164 --> 07:47.866
But turning the wheel
was probably

07:47.866 --> 07:48.967
going to make things worse.

07:48.967 --> 07:51.570
Putting pressure
on the right front tire,

07:51.570 --> 07:52.604
causing it to blow.

07:52.604 --> 07:55.440
The bus then
veers to the right

07:55.440 --> 07:57.175
and goes off the road.

07:57.175 --> 07:58.977
And we're back to Newton.

07:58.977 --> 07:59.945
The theory's correct

07:59.945 --> 08:02.414
if
the rod arm
was the first action.

08:02.414 --> 08:05.384
I'm going to see what's going on

08:05.384 --> 08:07.852
with that Camaro.

08:36.114 --> 08:39.318
We're going to get you
out of here, okay?

08:39.318 --> 08:40.511
Rescue!

08:41.620 --> 08:44.350
Can you tell me your name?

08:48.960 --> 08:51.554
Miss, you need
to let him go.

08:52.931 --> 08:56.268
Let's go on three.
One, two, three, in.

08:56.268 --> 08:59.671
(clanging)

08:59.671 --> 09:02.902
(doors shut)

09:03.575 --> 09:06.345
This never happened
to me before.

09:06.345 --> 09:09.514
The wheel just sh... shook
right out of my hands.

09:09.514 --> 09:12.417
How long after
your scheduled
stop in Barstow?

09:12.417 --> 09:16.188
We... we... we always stop
in Barstow.

09:16.188 --> 09:17.356
Uh... McDonald's.

09:17.356 --> 09:19.891
The, uh...
train station one.

09:19.891 --> 09:23.895
I understand that, Mr. Draper,
but how long after
that

09:23.895 --> 09:26.898
did the wheel start
to shake on you?

09:26.898 --> 09:29.234
Uh...

09:29.234 --> 09:32.170
I don't, uh...

09:32.170 --> 09:33.672
I don't know.

09:33.672 --> 09:35.674
Sir, are you okay?

09:35.674 --> 09:36.875
No.

09:36.875 --> 09:38.009
We're behind schedule.

09:38.009 --> 09:39.711
I got to get back
to the bus.

09:39.711 --> 09:40.879
Hold on, hold on.

09:40.879 --> 09:42.280
Wait a second, now.

09:42.280 --> 09:45.477
Mr. Draper...

09:47.119 --> 09:50.611
Mr. Draper, have you had
anything to drink tonight?

09:51.590 --> 09:55.527
I'm going to do
a preliminary field breath test.

09:55.527 --> 09:57.429
You keep an eye
on Mr. Draper for me.

09:57.429 --> 09:58.997
Mr. Draper,
you sit tight.

09:58.997 --> 09:59.965
I, uh... I got to go.

09:59.965 --> 10:02.067
This won't
take a minute.
I understand.

10:02.067 --> 10:03.435
I understand.
Hang tight.

10:03.435 --> 10:05.237
The, uh...
there's people...

10:05.237 --> 10:06.338
I understand.

10:06.338 --> 10:07.506
I want you to take
a deep breath.

10:07.506 --> 10:10.964
I want you to blow into the end
of this for me, okay?

10:14.446 --> 10:16.281
(coughing)

10:16.281 --> 10:18.417
I need a doctor
over here.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.085
Greg, get some help.

10:20.085 --> 10:21.686
Greg!

10:21.686 --> 10:22.954
Greg!

10:22.954 --> 10:25.422
Get some help!

10:26.191 --> 10:27.759
That's all right, man.

10:27.759 --> 10:29.094
Stop apologizing.

10:29.094 --> 10:31.363
Oh, I feel bad.

10:31.363 --> 10:32.330
I just froze up.

10:32.330 --> 10:34.566
That's why we have
field training, Greg.

10:34.566 --> 10:38.003
No disrespect, but you're
not qualified to be out here.

10:38.003 --> 10:42.607
Guess I just wasn't
expecting blood
to look like that...

10:42.607 --> 10:45.343
pre-collection...
so different.

10:45.343 --> 10:46.111
Yep.

10:46.111 --> 10:48.313
I remember my first
time in the field.

10:48.313 --> 10:51.082
CSI One.
Green as could be.

10:51.082 --> 10:52.951
Initial call
was a robbery.

10:52.951 --> 10:54.553
I get there,
triple homicide.

10:54.553 --> 10:58.356
Blood all over the place...
mother and two kids.

10:58.356 --> 11:00.258
How do you deal?

11:00.258 --> 11:02.226
You just do.

11:05.230 --> 11:07.766
Okay, what's next?

11:07.766 --> 11:09.534
Well, we're missing
a passenger.

11:09.534 --> 11:13.705
The only one unaccounted for is
an ex-con named Calvin McBride.

11:13.705 --> 11:16.308
According to Brass, he wasn't
admitted to the hospital,

11:16.308 --> 11:18.009
and he's not in any
of the body bags.

11:18.009 --> 11:19.644
What about the rest
stop in Barstow?

11:19.644 --> 11:22.408
CHP and the Barstow PD
are looking.

11:23.315 --> 11:25.977
Anybody check the bus?

11:31.122 --> 11:33.283
I'll find out.

12:03.121 --> 12:07.057
Firefighters only look
in the obvious spots.

12:08.627 --> 12:13.031
Just out of curiosity,
what are the
unobvious
spots?

12:13.031 --> 12:14.833
For bodies?
Yeah.

12:14.833 --> 12:18.203
Walls, hot water heaters,

12:18.203 --> 12:21.439
stuffed in the box spring
of a hotel room bed.

12:21.439 --> 12:24.772
I found a head in
a bucket of paint once.

12:25.377 --> 12:27.811
I get the picture.

12:35.754 --> 12:37.422
What do you see?

12:37.422 --> 12:39.791
Well...

12:39.791 --> 12:43.090
McBride's not on the bus.

13:04.849 --> 13:07.385
Grissom.

13:07.385 --> 13:09.287
Cheap whiskey,

13:09.287 --> 13:11.656
broken bottle, brown paper bag.

13:11.656 --> 13:17.219
You know, I never gave
the bus driver a breath test.

13:20.165 --> 13:20.765
Greg,

13:20.765 --> 13:23.602
bag this, take it
to the lab,

13:23.602 --> 13:26.196
swab the rim for DNA.

13:28.807 --> 13:31.298
You should be wearing gloves.

13:33.011 --> 13:34.672
Sorry.

13:37.882 --> 13:40.680
This guy was in 1-C.

13:48.560 --> 13:49.661
Seat 1-C was the only seat

13:49.661 --> 13:53.722
with an unobstructed path
through the windshield.

14:03.341 --> 14:06.139
Where's the other half
of this windshield?

14:24.162 --> 14:28.155
Laminated safety glass...
pops in, pops out.

14:41.746 --> 14:44.510
Hello,
Mr. McBride.

14:45.517 --> 14:49.977
I'm afraid our ex-con
just got the death penalty.

14:52.023 --> 14:55.527
He's one of the victims
in the bus crash.

14:55.527 --> 14:56.795
He was in the Camaro.

14:56.795 --> 14:58.697
He was driving the Camaro.

14:58.697 --> 14:59.698
Excuse me.

14:59.698 --> 15:00.465
Ma'am, not now.

15:00.465 --> 15:02.701
Catherine Willows,
with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

15:02.701 --> 15:03.935
This will just take a second.

15:03.935 --> 15:05.203
Can you tell me
your name?

15:05.203 --> 15:06.304
Eric.
Eric?

15:06.304 --> 15:09.908
I just wanted to surprise her,
that's all.

15:09.908 --> 15:10.975
If I don't make it,

15:10.975 --> 15:12.610
please tell her
I'm sorry.

15:12.610 --> 15:14.479
Ma'am, this is
the operating room.

15:14.479 --> 15:15.912
You need to leave.

15:18.450 --> 15:23.722
I need the two front wheels,
axle, suspension, all of it.

15:23.722 --> 15:25.990
The whole front undercarriage.

15:25.990 --> 15:27.821
You got it.

15:36.668 --> 15:38.236
Excuse me, miss.

15:38.236 --> 15:39.838
This is
a crime scene.

15:39.838 --> 15:41.072
It's off limits.

15:41.072 --> 15:41.840
I know.

15:41.840 --> 15:45.105
I was, uh...
I was on the bus.

15:49.013 --> 15:50.742
Why are you here?

15:52.650 --> 15:54.619
I don't...

15:54.619 --> 15:56.746
I don't know.

16:01.192 --> 16:02.887
I'm sorry.

16:07.198 --> 16:09.257
(sighs)

16:22.981 --> 16:24.949
Shreds of rubber everywhere.

16:24.949 --> 16:27.685
Between the crash, and all
the other interstate traffic,

16:27.685 --> 16:29.120
it might as well
be the Indy 500.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.655
This stuff could
be from
any
vehicle.

16:30.655 --> 16:35.615
There's no doubt that this bus
body-checked this K-Rail.

16:55.814 --> 16:58.442
(tires squealing)

17:20.538 --> 17:22.607
You got that "Sara" look.

17:22.607 --> 17:25.042
You mean that "Grissom" look?

17:25.042 --> 17:28.146
Second set
of skid marks.

17:28.146 --> 17:29.681
Camaro.

17:29.681 --> 17:31.615
I got a theory.

17:32.050 --> 17:35.854
Grissom said the suspension
gave on the bus, right?

17:35.854 --> 17:37.956
Broken rod arm.

17:37.956 --> 17:39.023
Well,
I'm thinking

17:39.023 --> 17:41.526
when that rod arm
hit the pavement

17:41.526 --> 17:44.984
it made this great
first impression here.

17:49.167 --> 17:51.035
Okay, this is the bus.

17:51.035 --> 17:53.204
The bus begins
to slide right.

17:53.204 --> 17:54.933
Driver overcorrects.

17:56.307 --> 17:58.610
Crosses the highway...

17:58.610 --> 18:00.475
slams into the K-Rail.

18:02.146 --> 18:02.814
Meanwhile,

18:02.814 --> 18:05.750
the Camaro's holding
steady in the right lane,

18:05.750 --> 18:07.085
heading straight
for us.

18:07.085 --> 18:09.553
Bus bounces off
this K-Rail...

18:10.755 --> 18:12.123
back towards us.

18:12.123 --> 18:15.149
Taking out anything
in its path.

18:16.961 --> 18:19.063
Bus crosses four
lanes of traffic,

18:19.063 --> 18:21.132
and only takes out
the car behind it?

18:21.132 --> 18:25.762
Yeah. Someone upstairs
was looking out big-time.

18:30.842 --> 18:32.241
Hey, boss.

18:33.011 --> 18:35.013
I had a feeling
you were coming.

18:35.013 --> 18:37.282
I ran the DNA
on that whiskey bottle.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.249
You'll never guess.

18:38.249 --> 18:39.083
It's not the bus driver,

18:39.083 --> 18:41.920
but I do have an answer
behind door number two.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.254
Seat number 1-C.

18:43.254 --> 18:44.656
Calvin McBride.

18:44.656 --> 18:46.791
He's an ex-con.
Found his DNA in CODIS.

18:46.791 --> 18:48.918
Good, Greg.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.130
Did you enjoy
being in the field?

18:52.130 --> 18:54.565
You heard about it, too?

18:54.565 --> 18:56.200
What?

18:56.200 --> 18:58.036
That I...

18:58.036 --> 19:00.138
messed up.

19:00.138 --> 19:01.765
No.

19:02.807 --> 19:05.207
Well, then I enjoyed it fine.

19:08.813 --> 19:11.382
You're telling me
this guy
wasn't
intoxicated?

19:11.382 --> 19:13.651
Not a drop of ethanol
in his system...

19:13.651 --> 19:15.019
not even
from cough syrup.

19:15.019 --> 19:16.788
He could barely
put a sentence together.

19:16.788 --> 19:18.890
If he wasn't drunk,
then what was he?

19:18.890 --> 19:19.958
My guess, hungry.

19:19.958 --> 19:21.326
Driver's medical eval

19:21.326 --> 19:23.394
taken just
last month.

19:23.394 --> 19:26.097
Martin Draper, 40.

19:26.097 --> 19:26.898
Overweight.

19:26.898 --> 19:28.066
One of 15 million
people

19:28.066 --> 19:31.302
in this country suffering
from Type II diabetes.

19:31.302 --> 19:32.103
On any medication?

19:32.103 --> 19:34.739
Primary course of treatment
would have been exercise

19:34.739 --> 19:36.474
and weight loss
to lower blood sugar.

19:36.474 --> 19:38.810
Doesn't look like
he was hitting the gym.

19:38.810 --> 19:40.979
But he was
dieting.

19:40.979 --> 19:42.146
Crash dieting.

19:42.146 --> 19:43.214
Didn't find

19:43.214 --> 19:44.282
any food in
his stomach.

19:44.282 --> 19:45.383
Means he
hadn't eaten

19:45.383 --> 19:46.184
anything in at least six hours.

19:46.184 --> 19:48.419
An empty stomach
invites hypoglycemia.

19:48.419 --> 19:51.589
Symptoms of which can
mirror intoxication.

19:51.589 --> 19:53.324
And in extreme cases?

19:53.324 --> 19:57.095
Loss of consciousness
and seizure.

19:57.095 --> 19:58.129
Do I pass?

19:58.129 --> 19:59.964
Cum laude.

19:59.964 --> 20:01.332
Cause of death?

20:01.332 --> 20:02.233
Just what you'd expect.

20:02.233 --> 20:04.335
Massive injuries,
internal bleeding.

20:04.335 --> 20:06.237
So it's not the driver.

20:06.237 --> 20:08.000
We're looking at the bus.

20:33.264 --> 20:34.959
Check this out.

20:38.436 --> 20:40.605
A bolt?

20:40.605 --> 20:41.773
Nice.

20:41.773 --> 20:43.001
I got 20 of them.

20:43.041 --> 20:44.406
Well,
this one's sheared.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.712
It is, isn't it?

21:15.339 --> 21:19.177
Bus company just faxed over
a maintenance report.

21:19.177 --> 21:21.345
Bus was in
perfect working order.

21:21.345 --> 21:23.074
Serviced last week.

21:23.514 --> 21:26.884
Does this look like it's
in perfect working order?

21:26.884 --> 21:29.587
Uh... no.

21:29.587 --> 21:31.222
What did you get?

21:31.222 --> 21:32.123
Three-quarter
inch bolt.

21:32.123 --> 21:35.193
It matches the bolt
on the specs for this
suspension system.

21:35.193 --> 21:38.685
The hex head says
it's a grade eight.

21:41.165 --> 21:42.133
Snapped in half?

21:42.133 --> 21:44.368
Bolts are graded according
to their hardness.

21:44.368 --> 21:46.504
The higher the grade,
the stronger the steel.

21:46.504 --> 21:49.173
A grade eight bolt shouldn't
snap like a toothpick.

21:49.173 --> 21:50.641
Did you do a Rockwell
Hardness test?

21:50.641 --> 21:51.809
Yeah,
I hit it with the Tru-Blue.

21:51.809 --> 21:55.074
It's not a grade eight.
It's a grade five.

22:03.154 --> 22:06.180
Often, when there's one...

22:08.126 --> 22:09.991
there's another one.

22:11.929 --> 22:14.265
Bus company
was using bogus bolts.

22:14.265 --> 22:17.635
Inferior bolts would cause
the suspension to give...

22:17.635 --> 22:19.437
the bus veers off the road.

22:19.437 --> 22:20.872
If the sheared bolts

22:20.872 --> 22:21.806
were the first
action.

22:21.806 --> 22:25.643
No, the bolts snapped
midway through the skid,

22:25.643 --> 22:27.979
after the bus hit the K-Rail.

22:27.979 --> 22:28.779
Proof?

22:28.779 --> 22:30.804
The gouge in the road.

22:33.684 --> 22:36.254
Broken rod arm,
maybe?

22:36.254 --> 22:37.054
Okay.

22:37.054 --> 22:40.217
Driver hits the brakes,
initiates the skid.

22:41.526 --> 22:42.827
Why did he
hit the brakes?

22:42.827 --> 22:43.594
Another vehicle.

22:43.594 --> 22:45.329
Nope. Only two sets
of fresh skid marks

22:45.329 --> 22:47.331
on that stretch
of highway.

22:47.331 --> 22:51.602
And the Camaro's skid marks
place it behind the bus.

22:51.602 --> 22:53.171
So I ask again...

22:53.171 --> 22:53.838
why did he
hit the brakes?

22:53.838 --> 22:54.238
(chuckles)

22:54.238 --> 22:55.706
Man, there could
be a million reasons.

22:55.706 --> 22:59.699
Well, fortunately,
we're just looking for one.

23:09.487 --> 23:13.548
The kid in the Camaro
didn't make it.

23:13.858 --> 23:15.393
Eric Kevlin, 32.

23:15.393 --> 23:18.296
He was a resident
at the UCLA Med Center.

23:18.296 --> 23:20.598
He was on his way to Vegas
to surprise his girlfriend.

23:20.598 --> 23:22.833
Only to end up
pinned under a bus.

23:22.833 --> 23:25.903
But he's rescued.

23:25.903 --> 23:29.207
Given a second chance on life.

23:29.207 --> 23:32.199
And, uh... he signs this.

23:33.477 --> 23:34.812
It's a pre-op DNR.

23:34.812 --> 23:36.881
"Do not resuscitate"?

23:36.881 --> 23:40.078
It doesn't make sense
for a young person.

23:42.086 --> 23:43.554
Why refuse CPR?

23:43.554 --> 23:46.390
Our company has
an excellent safety record.

23:46.390 --> 23:47.291
Until last night.

23:47.291 --> 23:49.126
Look, you own an airline
or a bus company...

23:49.126 --> 23:51.562
any transport business...
accidents are inevitable.

23:51.562 --> 23:55.166
- Criminal acts, however,
are another matter. - Wait a minute.

23:55.166 --> 23:57.235
I've got a family. Sometimes they ride my

23:57.235 --> 23:59.937
I don't take a chance with
their lives or anybody else's.

23:59.937 --> 24:02.235
I screen all
my drivers. Zero tolerance for
drugs or alcohol.

24:02.373 --> 24:07.470
I keep strict
maintenance records. Vehicle inspection
every 45 days

24:07.812 --> 24:09.177
You're not going to find
anything criminal here.

24:10.248 --> 24:12.045
I believe this belongs to you.

24:13.751 --> 24:15.686
Bolt, grade eight.

24:15.686 --> 24:17.355
Sheared.

24:17.355 --> 24:19.156
It doesn't happen.

24:19.156 --> 24:22.091
The front suspension
was riddled with these.

24:22.493 --> 24:25.696
We have more questions
about the accident, but one thing we know...

24:25.696 --> 24:27.231
the suspension didn't hold.

24:27.231 --> 24:29.791
I buy all my spare parts
from reputable companies.

24:29.934 --> 24:31.535
We only care about the bolts.

24:31.535 --> 24:32.934
Brillway Bolt Company.

24:34.272 --> 24:36.240
I just switched;
they were low bid.

24:36.274 --> 24:39.266
The consequences
of saving a buck.

24:40.077 --> 24:42.272
I think maybe it's time
for another inspection.

24:44.282 --> 24:45.613
I'll ground
the fleet.

25:36.334 --> 25:38.069
I get it,
I get it, I get it.

25:38.069 --> 25:38.469
It's busy here
in Barstow.

25:38.469 --> 25:40.304
But you do remember the bus?

25:40.304 --> 25:41.906
Yeah. I knew
the driver... Marty.

25:41.906 --> 25:43.741
Always fill him up
on the return trip.

25:43.741 --> 25:46.844
I remember this one guy
kept checking me out.

25:46.844 --> 25:49.213
Bought a lot
of turkey jerky.

25:49.213 --> 25:51.115
Oh, and this one couple
was having a fight.

25:51.115 --> 25:53.184
Did, uh... did they
come off the bus?

25:53.184 --> 25:54.752
I don't know.

25:54.752 --> 25:56.987
But you do
remember the bus?

25:56.987 --> 25:58.978
Of course. Mojave Express.

25:59.123 --> 26:01.853
Always on time. Ten-minute rest stop,
right back on the road.

26:01.959 --> 26:02.860
Did you see a couple arguing?

26:02.860 --> 26:07.160
No. But it was really busy.

26:45.002 --> 26:46.401
Hey, Nick.

26:48.372 --> 26:49.396
Making
any progress?

26:50.307 --> 26:53.504
Just this jacket so far. Passenger seat. And

26:55.513 --> 26:56.647
We checked Kevlin's property
at the hospital.

26:56.647 --> 26:57.448
There's no wallet.

26:57.448 --> 27:01.851
Guy drives from L.A.
Four and a half hours...

27:02.386 --> 27:03.387
I got an idea.

27:03.387 --> 27:04.445
(grunts)

27:06.457 --> 27:09.255
Hand me that, uh...
crowbar there, please.

27:11.429 --> 27:12.953
Thank you.

27:19.203 --> 27:20.871
Yeah.

27:20.871 --> 27:22.395
Bingo.

27:26.844 --> 27:27.945
I always take mine out.

27:27.945 --> 27:29.380
Pain in the ass.

27:29.380 --> 27:30.481
Literally.

27:30.481 --> 27:32.676
Yeah, that's him.

27:34.685 --> 27:35.743
Yeah.

27:37.221 --> 27:39.689
Nice-looking girl.

27:40.691 --> 27:41.885
Wait.

27:43.627 --> 27:46.118
I've seen her.

27:47.698 --> 27:50.100
Yeah. Yeah, I've seen her.

27:50.100 --> 27:52.570
She was in
the accident.

27:52.570 --> 27:55.903
He said he wanted
to surprise you.

27:57.608 --> 27:59.176
He did.

27:59.176 --> 28:01.545
In Barstow, at the rest stop.

28:01.545 --> 28:05.316
It was supposed
to be a girls' weekend.

28:05.316 --> 28:07.151
Come back to L.A. With me.

28:07.151 --> 28:08.486
No! This is my weekend.

28:08.486 --> 28:11.589
If this is
going to work,
I need my space.

28:11.589 --> 28:13.489
- I don't want
to lose you. - Then go back home.

28:14.658 --> 28:18.028
I saw him pull out.

28:18.028 --> 28:19.256
Drive off.

28:21.265 --> 28:23.367
Well, he didn't
drive back to L.A.

28:23.367 --> 28:26.461
I wish I hadn't yelled at him.

28:28.372 --> 28:31.809
Is there any reason why Eric,
in a medical crisis,

28:31.809 --> 28:34.512
would refuse resuscitation?

28:34.512 --> 28:36.013
What are you talking about?

28:36.013 --> 28:39.583
He consented to lifesaving surgery, but...

28:39.583 --> 28:42.677
signed a DNR.

28:44.088 --> 28:46.056
My God.

28:48.526 --> 28:50.255
It's because he was a doctor.

28:52.530 --> 28:53.764
He saw it every day.

28:53.764 --> 28:56.100
People hooked up to machines,
waiting to die.

28:56.100 --> 28:59.670
He swore he wouldn't
let anyone he loved

28:59.670 --> 29:00.738
go through that.

29:00.738 --> 29:02.406
And, if his life was at stake,

29:02.406 --> 29:04.775
he wanted to make
the hard decision

29:04.775 --> 29:08.336
so no one else would have to.

29:41.478 --> 29:45.583
I thought I told you
I'd page you with the results.

29:45.583 --> 29:48.746
I know. I want to wait.

29:55.593 --> 29:56.760
Greg?

29:56.760 --> 29:58.694
You're really good
at what you do.

30:08.706 --> 30:10.799
Sabotage.

30:22.786 --> 30:24.521
Grissom.

30:24.521 --> 30:26.890
I finally know
the first action.

30:26.890 --> 30:27.992
What initiated the skid.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.461
The right front tire
started to come apart.

30:30.461 --> 30:34.795
When it blew, it left
an indentation in the pavement.

30:36.133 --> 30:37.368
I didn't see it.

30:37.368 --> 30:38.268
You and me both.

30:38.268 --> 30:41.931
The treads from the right
rear tire obscured it.

30:44.408 --> 30:46.744
So, the driver overcorrects.

30:46.744 --> 30:47.745
But, since
there's no more tire,

30:47.745 --> 30:50.280
all that force is displaced
on the suspension system.

30:50.280 --> 30:54.551
The bolt snaps,
the rod arm breaks

30:54.551 --> 30:56.314
and the bus
broadsides the Camaro.

30:56.820 --> 31:02.156
But why did the tire come apart
in the first place?

31:03.794 --> 31:05.562
I don't know.

31:05.562 --> 31:06.330
I do.

31:06.330 --> 31:10.790
Chloroform. Inside the tire.

31:17.675 --> 31:21.509
Newton's Third... with a twist.

31:22.179 --> 31:23.747
Yeah, the front right tire
was compromised.

31:23.747 --> 31:26.684
I found chloroform in
the interior fragments
of the rubber.

31:26.684 --> 31:29.186
Oh, that's original.
What happened to slashing tires?

31:29.186 --> 31:31.355
It wasn't vandalism.
It was an act of premeditation.

31:31.355 --> 31:35.993
Why chloroform?
Chloroform destroys the
elasticity of the rubber.

31:35.993 --> 31:37.428
Sooner or later,
the air pressure

31:37.428 --> 31:39.229
inside the tire
causes it to explode.

31:39.229 --> 31:39.963
How much later?

31:39.963 --> 31:41.999
Well, that's what
we're going to find out.

31:41.999 --> 31:43.667
We need a treadmill...
a big one.

31:43.667 --> 31:44.668
All right,
to do what?

31:44.668 --> 31:46.370
Exercise a bus. Warrick, tell Larry Maddox

31:46.370 --> 31:49.239
it's in his best interest
to lend us one of his.

31:49.239 --> 31:51.709
Set it up in the empty police
warehouse next door. Sara?

31:51.709 --> 31:54.041
Yeah, I'll be in Trace.
They're going to love this.

31:57.614 --> 32:00.117
Chloroform
in the tire?

32:00.117 --> 32:04.722
Yeah. Weird, huh?
So, where are we?

32:04.722 --> 32:07.391
Body count
jumped to nine dead.

32:07.391 --> 32:08.525
Sabrina Wright,

32:08.525 --> 32:09.727
law student, 7-B.

32:09.727 --> 32:10.794
Pronounced an hour ago.

32:10.794 --> 32:12.663
23 passengers,
plus the driver.

32:12.663 --> 32:18.402
Whoever tampered with that tire
was playing Russian roulette with people's

32:18.402 --> 32:20.137
Or maybe one of them
was a target.

32:20.137 --> 32:23.107
Hmm... Gwen Murray, 1-B...

32:23.107 --> 32:27.377
was unemployed,
but was clearing a bundle in alimony.

32:27.377 --> 32:30.481
Also got the Porsche
and vacation home.

32:30.481 --> 32:32.683
Michael Goodman,
10-C,

32:32.683 --> 32:35.486
was picked up a couple of times
by vice for making fake I.D.s.

32:35.486 --> 32:37.521
Ryan Hyde, a
money manager in 4-C

32:37.521 --> 32:40.124
filed
bankruptcy last year

32:40.124 --> 32:41.759
but carried a hefty
life insurance policy.

32:41.759 --> 32:43.260
I mean, I could go on.

32:43.260 --> 32:43.927
Right.

32:43.927 --> 32:45.062
You look hard enough,

32:45.062 --> 32:47.428
everybody's
got a skeleton.

32:49.266 --> 32:52.035
What was her skeleton?

32:52.035 --> 32:53.804
Tracey Logan?

32:53.804 --> 32:55.606
Seat 8-B.

32:55.606 --> 32:57.708
Her boyfriend
was Eric Kevlin,

32:57.708 --> 32:59.042
the Camaro driver.

32:59.042 --> 32:59.810
He was a doctor.

32:59.810 --> 33:01.111
He followed her
from L.A.

33:01.111 --> 33:03.046
They had an argument
in Barstow.

33:03.046 --> 33:04.381
He didn't want her
in Vegas.

33:04.381 --> 33:07.451
First step to stopping her
is stopping the bus.

33:07.451 --> 33:09.286
And he has access to chloroform.

33:09.286 --> 33:13.290
Chloroform can be picked up
at any chemical supply store.

33:13.290 --> 33:13.957
Wait a minute.

33:13.957 --> 33:16.460
Eric Kevlin was
a nervous boyfriend.

33:16.460 --> 33:17.528
He wasn't a criminal.

33:17.528 --> 33:22.366
Still possible.
Motive, access, opportunity.

33:22.366 --> 33:24.868
His car should be towed in
by now.

33:24.868 --> 33:28.565
I'll check for residue.

33:30.808 --> 33:32.509
So, who do you like?

33:32.509 --> 33:33.377
The bus company.

33:33.377 --> 33:36.046
Larry Maddox...
he talks a good game

33:36.046 --> 33:39.016
but, uh... he cheaped out
on the supplies,

33:39.016 --> 33:41.814
and he's been way too helpful.

33:50.360 --> 33:53.022
- You busy? - I got three minutes
and... five seconds.

33:53.330 --> 33:54.898
Then I have
a question for you.

33:54.898 --> 33:56.957
- Bus case? - Uh-huh.

33:57.534 --> 34:00.470
I heard Sanders
broke out of here, fared poorly

34:00.470 --> 34:01.772
and disgraced us all.

34:01.772 --> 34:03.364
No, he didn't.

34:05.409 --> 34:06.844
Listen, I... I found chloroform

34:06.844 --> 34:09.413
on the inside
of a steel-belted radial,

34:09.413 --> 34:10.614
and I need to know how it got there.

34:10.614 --> 34:14.051
You ever hear the expression,
"pissing up a rope"?

34:14.051 --> 34:16.687
Not in a scientific context, no.

34:16.687 --> 34:19.755
Well, I don't know
if you
can
urinate

34:19.755 --> 34:20.456
up a rope,

34:20.456 --> 34:22.025
but you can urinate
against a rope

34:22.025 --> 34:24.094
and the urine will dribble down.

34:24.094 --> 34:25.929
Answer your
question?

34:25.929 --> 34:27.931
Yep.

34:27.931 --> 34:29.398
You know we need
to document this for
The Journal
of Forensic Science,
right?

34:34.438 --> 34:35.234
Is this the twin?

34:35.304 --> 34:38.208
Yeah, this is the rear trailing
tire of the crash bus.

34:38.208 --> 34:40.878
It has the same
maintenance record of the tire
that blew.

34:40.878 --> 34:43.413
Chloroform, glass rod,

34:43.413 --> 34:45.938
valve core remover...

34:46.382 --> 34:48.518
According to Vincent in Trace,

34:48.518 --> 34:50.853
it's like pissing
down a rope.

34:50.853 --> 34:53.219
Gravity, huh?

35:10.540 --> 35:12.303
Reattach the valve...

35:16.747 --> 35:18.647
reinflate the tire...

35:19.549 --> 35:21.949
(air hissing)

35:29.726 --> 35:31.728
...and you're done.

35:31.728 --> 35:35.755
Minute, minute and a half, tops.

35:36.433 --> 35:39.266
- Did you just see that? - Yeah.

35:39.436 --> 35:42.005
You used your left hand
to prop yourself up.

35:42.005 --> 35:45.709
Perp could have
done the same.

35:45.709 --> 35:49.543
Yeah. I'm going to go dust
that right rim. I'll see you guys.

35:51.048 --> 35:56.918
Okay. "Drive," he said.
Just the speed limit.

35:59.623 --> 36:02.717
(motor whirring)

36:31.488 --> 36:33.683
(computer beeping)

36:53.443 --> 36:57.937
(cell phone ringing)

36:57.981 --> 36:59.642
Warrick.

36:59.783 --> 37:00.772
Hey.

37:00.984 --> 37:02.975
Yeah, okay.

37:03.020 --> 37:05.011
I'll be there
in a minute.

37:06.990 --> 37:09.693
Sara. She's at the print lab.

37:09.693 --> 37:12.059
She needs me.

37:16.466 --> 37:18.798
Checkmate.

37:30.047 --> 37:33.847
Print off the rim matched a work card
on file... a Sean Nolan.

37:34.051 --> 37:36.253
So, why are
you paging me?

37:36.253 --> 37:39.723
I pulled up his DMV
records looking
for an address.

37:39.723 --> 37:40.390
I found one. Not recent, but...

37:40.390 --> 37:44.053
he's got a Class B license
with passenger endorsement.

37:44.394 --> 37:48.023
Oh... so he can drive a vehicle
with over ten passengers.

37:48.065 --> 37:52.335
- I cross-checked his name
with the employee roster from Mojave

37:52.335 --> 37:53.097
He's a driver.

37:54.071 --> 37:55.772
Well, I guess
I'll grab a uniform

37:55.772 --> 37:59.731
and pay Mr. Maddox
another visit.

38:00.043 --> 38:01.601
Thanks.

38:03.146 --> 38:07.082
Bus logged into Barstow
at 8:03 p.m.

38:07.117 --> 38:08.585
Target would
be two hours later.

38:08.585 --> 38:11.076
Well, if the tire
was tampered
with in Barstow, it should blow
any minute.

38:11.421 --> 38:13.256
If not, it was
sabotaged in L.A.

38:13.256 --> 38:16.089
And we've got another
two hours and 13 minutes.

38:18.228 --> 38:21.095
Hello.

38:21.465 --> 38:23.797
(sighs)

38:31.174 --> 38:32.509
(explosion)

38:32.509 --> 38:34.477
(motor stops)

38:34.945 --> 38:35.934
Cool.

38:36.079 --> 38:38.673
Well, I guess
it's Barstow.

38:39.082 --> 38:40.817
Listen.

38:40.817 --> 38:44.087
I scanned Eric
Kevlin's car and clothing
with an ion detector.

38:44.087 --> 38:45.611
There was no chloroform.
He was clean.

38:45.789 --> 38:46.957
And I got a hit
off that print...

38:46.957 --> 38:50.127
a Sean Nolan,
employed by Mojave Express.

38:50.127 --> 38:52.357
Any chance
he was in Barstow yesterday?

38:52.462 --> 38:56.133
Uh... his route is...
Vegas-Grand Canyon,

38:56.133 --> 38:59.398
but I'll call Warrick. He's on his way
to the bus company right now.

38:59.636 --> 39:02.639
You know, if this guy Nolan
worked for the bus company,

39:02.639 --> 39:05.107
his print on the wheel
could be legit.

39:05.976 --> 39:07.443
Well, I wish we had a "who,"

39:08.111 --> 39:10.847
but at least we have a "where."

39:10.847 --> 39:13.150
I have a zero
tolerance policy.

39:13.150 --> 39:16.153
I found marijuana
in Mr. Nolan's locker.

39:16.153 --> 39:17.721
He was out of here
that afternoon.

39:17.721 --> 39:20.485
Well, we're still going to need those
maintenance records.

39:25.128 --> 39:28.765
Everything from fill-ups
to tune-ups the last six months.

39:28.765 --> 39:30.892
Thank you.

39:33.003 --> 39:35.505
There were
security cameras
behind the counter,

39:35.505 --> 39:37.166
but none of them were
pointed out here.

39:37.340 --> 39:39.843
Five buses have pulled in
in the last ten minutes.

39:39.843 --> 39:41.511
Not to mention all
the private vehicles,

39:41.511 --> 39:44.173
truckers... nothing's changed
since I was here yesterday.

39:44.714 --> 39:46.909
Forget about getting
a usable print off that air hose.

39:47.150 --> 39:51.054
Yeah, a guy putting air
in a tire at a rest stop does not draw
attention.

39:51.054 --> 39:52.622
(cell phone rings)
Grissom.

39:52.622 --> 39:54.891
Sean Nolan was fired
two months ago.

39:54.891 --> 39:56.860
Maddox says he's working
in Barstow

39:56.860 --> 40:00.630
and, since then, three
of Maddox's buses had blowouts.

40:00.630 --> 40:02.699
They all went through Barstow.

40:02.699 --> 40:04.434
Did you check
their maintenance records?

40:04.434 --> 40:09.105
Yeah. Only last night's bus
had been serviced since Maddox changed

40:09.105 --> 40:11.875
Way to go, Warrick. I owe you.

40:11.875 --> 40:13.433
Yeah, you do. See you.

40:14.177 --> 40:16.446
We got a suspect.

40:16.446 --> 40:18.607
Sean Nolan.

40:23.186 --> 40:25.654
That's him. That's our boy.

40:27.591 --> 40:29.923
Sean Nolan?

40:30.927 --> 40:32.195
Can I help you?

40:32.195 --> 40:36.199
Yeah. There was a bus crash
up the road. About nine people died.

40:36.199 --> 40:38.068
Yeah. It's all
over the news.

40:38.068 --> 40:39.202
I already
talked to him.

40:39.202 --> 40:40.604
I forgot what you told me.

40:40.604 --> 40:42.138
There wasn't much to tell.

40:42.138 --> 40:44.241
Your prints
were on the bus.

40:44.241 --> 40:46.732
Not following you.

40:46.910 --> 40:48.645
Front right wheel hub.

40:48.645 --> 40:49.412
I work here.

40:49.412 --> 40:52.215
Julius Caesar,
murdered in 44 B.C.

40:52.215 --> 40:55.051
Legend has it
that the molecules
from his last breath

40:55.051 --> 40:56.152
spread all over
the world.

40:56.152 --> 40:59.246
Probably like
your fingerprints, right? They're

41:00.257 --> 41:03.954
Uh... Mr. Nolan, have you
handled any chloroform lately?

41:05.262 --> 41:06.363
No.

41:06.363 --> 41:08.498
You mind?

41:08.498 --> 41:10.200
(slow beeping)

41:10.200 --> 41:11.668
What are you doing?

41:11.668 --> 41:13.932
Would you turn
around, please?

41:19.709 --> 41:20.510
Whoa.

41:20.510 --> 41:23.775
Is that a pickle
in your pocket, or you just
happy to see us?

41:37.160 --> 41:39.663
Just wanted to stick it to him.

41:39.663 --> 41:41.790
Give him a few problems.

41:42.299 --> 41:43.527
Maddox?

41:45.268 --> 41:46.462
Yeah.

41:47.370 --> 41:50.640
I smoke one joint
on the weekend... my time.

41:50.640 --> 41:53.268
Now I got a jacket as a junkie.

41:53.810 --> 41:56.246
Can't get a job driving a bus
to save my life.

41:56.246 --> 42:01.117
So, you figured, "I'll just
blow a couple of his tires."

42:01.117 --> 42:04.985
Even if a tire blows, the suspension system
should keep the bus on the road.

42:05.288 --> 42:07.415
I been driving buses
for ten years.

42:07.657 --> 42:09.959
I've never seen a flat
take out a bus.

42:09.959 --> 42:12.829
Well, there's
always a first time.

42:12.829 --> 42:15.161
You're under arrest.

42:22.038 --> 42:25.633
I didn't mean
to hurt anyone, okay?

42:27.644 --> 42:31.348
Well, I'd hate to be a juror
in a case like this.
