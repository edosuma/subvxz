58:41.586 --> 58:43.103
None of the witnesses
could pick the defendant

58:43.137 --> 58:44.965
out of the lineup, could they?

58:45.000 --> 58:45.793
Yes.

58:48.862 --> 58:49.758
DUKE:
Yes.

58:53.586 --> 58:54.793
You argued

58:56.172 --> 58:58.068
that the defendant's DNA
could be found

58:58.103 --> 59:00.896
at several murder scenes,
correct?

59:00.931 --> 59:03.275
But what you
didn't tell the jury

59:03.310 --> 59:05.724
is that the initial test
came back negative

59:05.758 --> 59:06.758
and inconclusive.

59:06.793 --> 59:08.310
No, I didn't.

59:10.275 --> 59:12.689
And the samples only
came back positive,

59:12.724 --> 59:15.137
because the defendant's sample
was compromised.

59:17.862 --> 59:19.137
I didn't know that.

59:19.172 --> 59:20.689
Oh,
did you read the report
carefully

59:20.724 --> 59:21.689
or just the conclusion?

59:21.724 --> 59:23.103
The conclusion.

59:23.137 --> 59:24.689
Did the judge know about this?

59:24.724 --> 59:25.793
No.

59:27.655 --> 59:28.620
Yes.

59:28.655 --> 59:30.241
Yes.

59:30.275 --> 59:30.551
Some.

59:30.586 --> 59:32.000
Not all.

59:43.000 --> 59:43.827
Why did you do that?

59:43.862 --> 59:45.344
Because I knew he did it!

59:49.655 --> 59:50.344
It's in his blood.

59:52.068 --> 59:54.172
Like father, like sons.

59:56.758 --> 59:57.896
Did you just mention my father?

59:59.275 --> 01:00:01.034
You knew the rules
and you lied.

01:00:01.068 --> 01:00:03.000
Your lies cause people to die.

01:00:03.034 --> 01:00:04.827
See, you cover your lies
in the flag.

01:00:04.862 --> 01:00:06.103
The same fucking flag
that's covered

01:00:06.137 --> 01:00:06.827
in the blood of my people.

01:00:06.862 --> 01:00:08.379
Now you mention my father again,

01:00:08.413 --> 01:00:09.862
I'll shove this stick down
your fucking throat.

01:00:13.379 --> 01:00:15.137
When we were 6 and 8,

01:00:15.172 --> 01:00:16.965
our father was convicted
of a murder

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.275
that he didn't commit.

01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:20.034
How do you know that
he didn't do it?

01:00:21.172 --> 01:00:22.172
Because he was at home with us,

01:00:24.379 --> 01:00:25.827
reading us a story.

01:00:27.137 --> 01:00:29.103
My mom was a nurse,
so she worked late.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.137
So, whenever just someone
was being killed,

01:00:35.344 --> 01:00:37.000
he was educating his boys.

01:00:39.689 --> 01:00:43.034
But the judge
wouldn't even let us testify.

01:00:43.068 --> 01:00:45.103
He even threatened
to split us up,

01:00:45.137 --> 01:00:46.793
take us away from our mom.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.310
And guess who the judge was?

01:00:54.172 --> 01:00:55.965
How could you forget me
is the question?

01:00:57.206 --> 01:00:58.862

Your good buddy, Carl Smith.

01:01:06.344 --> 01:01:07.344
I miss him.

01:01:10.896 --> 01:01:14.793
He was just like a gentle,
lovable guy.

01:01:16.103 --> 01:01:19.965
He never even had a fist fight,
you know?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.034
So, when he got locked up,
he just--

01:01:22.068 --> 01:01:23.103
he just couldn't take it.

01:01:25.896 --> 01:01:28.241
Took his own life.

01:01:28.275 --> 01:01:30.206
And it crushed my mom.

01:01:30.241 --> 01:01:32.310
It crushed me.

01:01:32.344 --> 01:01:33.724
But honestly,

01:01:33.758 --> 01:01:35.000
I really think Gabriel took it
the hardest.

01:01:38.068 --> 01:01:41.862
So, if I had to guess,
I would say maybe he just

01:01:43.275 --> 01:01:45.068
don't want to see me go
through this.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.068
Or nobody for that matter.

01:01:48.103 --> 01:01:50.275

innocence project.
