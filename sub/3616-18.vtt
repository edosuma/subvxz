WEBVTT

00:03.351 --> 00:05.836
[Dark Priest] THE ELITE GUARD
WILL TAKE THEIR PLACESALONG THE AISLE.

00:05.936 --> 00:07.506
THEN, PRECISELY
AT MIDNIGHT,

00:07.606 --> 00:08.965
WE'LL BEGIN
THE RITUALISTIC CHANT,

00:09.066 --> 00:11.468
AND THEN YOU
WILL BE ESCORTED IN

00:11.568 --> 00:13.861
FOR THE CEREMONY.

00:18.242 --> 00:21.521
[Cole] AHEM.

00:21.621 --> 00:22.355
IT'S BEEN A WHILE,
HASN'T IT?

00:22.455 --> 00:23.872
500 YEARS,
GIVE OR TAKE A DECADE.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.000
AH, HERE IT IS.

00:27.876 --> 00:29.530
THE OATH.

00:29.630 --> 00:30.990
UPON COMPLETION
OF THE OATH,

00:31.090 --> 00:33.783
YOU WILL BE GIVEN
THE FULL POWERS

00:33.883 --> 00:36.078
OF THE UNDERWORLD.

00:36.179 --> 00:37.639
WILL I
FEEL DIFFERENT?

00:38.973 --> 00:40.791
AFTER?

00:40.891 --> 00:42.127
PERHAPS.

00:42.227 --> 00:43.467
THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE YOU
DESCRIBED A FEELING

00:43.567 --> 00:45.796
OF BEING...

00:45.896 --> 00:48.050
COMPLETE.

00:48.150 --> 00:49.360
HAVE ANY OF THEM
BEEN HALF HUMAN?

00:50.737 --> 00:53.515
NO.

00:53.615 --> 00:54.391
THIS IS A FIRST.

00:54.491 --> 00:55.907
NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU

00:56.827 --> 00:57.809
TO BEGIN YOUR PREPARATIONS.

00:57.910 --> 00:58.954
YOUR GUARDS WILL SHOW YOU
TO THE VESTIBULE.

00:59.747 --> 01:00.956
THIS WAY.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.495
ARREST ME.

01:38.955 --> 01:42.152
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:42.252 --> 01:43.378
I FOUND HIM OUTSIDE.

01:47.257 --> 01:50.453
A WIZARD.

01:50.553 --> 01:51.912
WELL, WELL.

01:52.012 --> 01:52.967
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE EXTINCT?

01:52.977 --> 01:55.874
ONE OF US
IS ALIVE AND WELL.

01:55.974 --> 01:58.086
NOT FOR LONG.

01:58.186 --> 01:58.977
DID YOU REALLY
THINK YOU COULD

02:00.397 --> 02:03.509
STOP THE CORONATION
ALL BY YOURSELF, WIZARD?I DIDN'T COME
FOR THE CORONATION.

02:03.609 --> 02:05.720
I CAME FOR THE REVENGE.

02:05.820 --> 02:07.472
[LAUGHS]

02:07.572 --> 02:08.988
OHH!

02:09.990 --> 02:12.977
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

02:13.077 --> 02:14.579
STOP HIM!

02:21.879 --> 02:25.090
IT'S AN ILLUSION.

02:29.971 --> 02:33.417
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

02:33.517 --> 02:36.002
COLE'S A DEMON AGAIN,
THAT IS WHAT'S GOING ON.

02:36.102 --> 02:38.506
DO YOU WANNA
LOSE US A SISTER?

02:38.606 --> 02:40.299
BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN

02:40.399 --> 02:42.176
IF YOU BLURT IT OUT
LIKE THAT.

02:42.276 --> 02:43.927
BESIDES, WE ONLY KNOW
THAT COLE IS DEALING

02:44.027 --> 02:45.889
WITH DEMONS,
NOT THAT HE IS A DEMON.

02:45.989 --> 02:47.931
IF IT LOOKS LIKE A DEMON

02:48.031 --> 02:49.476
AND WALKS LIKE A DEMON--

02:49.576 --> 02:50.477
THAT'S DUCKS!

02:50.577 --> 02:51.520
THAT'S NOT
PHOEBE'S HUSBAND,

02:51.620 --> 02:52.689
THE LOVE OF HER LIFE,

02:52.789 --> 02:53.815
HER BEST FRIEND--

02:53.915 --> 02:54.939
ALL RIGHT, I GET
YOUR POINT, WOMAN.

02:55.039 --> 02:57.277
LOOK, THIS ISN'T GONNA
BE EASY FOR HER TO HEAR,

02:57.377 --> 02:59.945
ESPECIALLY
SINCE SHE'S HAPPIER

03:00.045 --> 03:01.448
THAN SHE'S EVER BEEN.

03:01.548 --> 03:02.633
OR NOT.

03:04.718 --> 03:05.970
HI. COME ON IN.

03:08.054 --> 03:09.265
PHOEBE, WHAT'S
THE MATTER? YOU LOOK--

03:11.851 --> 03:13.795
TERRIBLE?

03:13.895 --> 03:14.961
YEAH, I HAVEN'T SLEPT
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

03:15.061 --> 03:17.174
WHY? WHAT'S
THE MATTER?

03:17.274 --> 03:18.633
UH, YOU GUYS SHOULD
PROBABLY SIT DOWN.

03:18.733 --> 03:21.969
THAT'S FUNNY.
WE WERE JUST
COMING TO ASK YOU

03:22.069 --> 03:23.070
TO DO
THE SAME THING.

03:27.953 --> 03:30.979
OK, SO...

03:31.079 --> 03:32.483
WHAT I'M ABOUT
TO TELL YOU IS REALLY...

03:32.583 --> 03:34.318
BIG.

03:34.418 --> 03:35.502
UH, WE'RE TALKING HUGE.

03:36.712 --> 03:38.823
SEE? SHE KNOWS.

03:38.923 --> 03:40.365
KNOWS WHAT?

03:40.465 --> 03:41.133
UH, YOU TELL US.

03:42.510 --> 03:43.970
UH...

03:45.471 --> 03:46.997
OK...

03:47.097 --> 03:48.641
W--I--I'M, UH...

03:50.310 --> 03:53.589
I'M PREGNANT.

03:53.689 --> 03:55.107
YOU'RE WHAT?

03:56.107 --> 03:57.108
OH, MY GOD!
FROM COLE?

04:03.992 --> 04:07.187
FIND THE WIZARD...

04:07.287 --> 04:08.998
OR YOU'RE NEXT.

05:05.018 --> 05:08.964
I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
HOW THIS COULD'VE HAPPENED.

05:09.064 --> 05:10.632
WE WERE BEING SO CAREFUL.

05:10.732 --> 05:14.093
IT'S THE LAST THING
I EXPECTED RIGHT NOW.

05:14.193 --> 05:16.179
HMM. JUST WAIT.

05:16.279 --> 05:17.532
DOES COLE KNOW?

05:19.701 --> 05:21.101
NO. NOT YET.

05:21.201 --> 05:23.104
I SHOULD'VE TOLD HIM,
I KNOW,

05:23.204 --> 05:24.522
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO.

05:24.623 --> 05:25.899
BESIDES, I DON'T WANT HIM
TO THINK

05:25.999 --> 05:27.359
THAT I'M NOT HAPPY
ABOUT IT.

05:27.459 --> 05:29.486
ARE YOU?

05:29.586 --> 05:30.487
[SIGHS]

05:30.587 --> 05:32.213
I DON'T KNOW.

05:33.925 --> 05:35.076
I MEAN...

05:35.176 --> 05:36.703
YOU KNOW, PART OF ME IS.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.121
OBVIOUSLY.

05:38.221 --> 05:40.122
I LOVE COLE.

05:40.222 --> 05:41.541
BUT THEN THERE'S
ANOTHER PART OF ME

05:41.641 --> 05:43.044
THAT'S SCARED TO DEATH.

05:43.144 --> 05:44.086
I MEAN, THERE'S
SO MANY CHANGES,

05:44.186 --> 05:45.253
AND IT'S ALL
HAPPENING SO FAST.

05:45.354 --> 05:47.923
I'M NOT SURE
I'M READY FOR THIS.

05:48.023 --> 05:50.133
OH, HONEY, YOU
SHOULD'VE TOLD US

05:50.233 --> 05:51.720
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT.

05:51.820 --> 05:53.055
AND THEN YOU
WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO

05:53.155 --> 05:54.137
THROUGH IT ALONE.

05:54.237 --> 05:55.307
I KNOW.

05:55.407 --> 05:56.808
BUT I WASN'T SURE...

05:56.908 --> 05:58.936
HOW YOU WOULD FEEL
ABOUT IT.

05:59.036 --> 06:00.312
ME? WHY?

06:00.412 --> 06:02.246
BECAUSE I KNOW HOW HARD
YOU AND LEO HAVE BEEN TRYING.

06:03.373 --> 06:06.170
OH, HONEY, THIS
DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING

06:07.252 --> 06:08.821
TO DO WITH ME.
IT HAS EVERYTHING

06:08.922 --> 06:10.198
TO DO WITH YOU, AND--

06:10.298 --> 06:11.324
AND I'D BE THRILLED
TO BE AN AUNT.

06:11.424 --> 06:13.869
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

06:13.969 --> 06:15.262
SO, WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA TELL COLE?

06:16.930 --> 06:18.164
I DON'T KNOW.

06:18.264 --> 06:19.166
HE'S GOT SO MUCH

06:19.266 --> 06:20.417
ON HIS PLATE RIGHT NOW,
YOU KNOW,

06:20.517 --> 06:22.168
WITH STARTING HIS NEW JOB
AND EVERYTHING.

06:22.268 --> 06:24.047
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT
ON YOUR PLATE, TOO,

06:24.147 --> 06:25.924
MORE THAN YOU REALIZE.

06:26.025 --> 06:26.967
YEAH! LIKE HOW MANY HOURS

06:27.067 --> 06:29.176
HE'S GONNA BE WORKING

06:29.276 --> 06:30.273
AND THAT HE'S NOT
GONNA BE HOME A LOT.

06:30.283 --> 06:32.263
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS
TALKING ABOUT, PIPER.

06:32.364 --> 06:35.434
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
PAIGE?

06:35.534 --> 06:37.186
IT CAN WAIT.

06:37.286 --> 06:38.562
[ELEVATOR DINGS]

06:38.662 --> 06:39.563
OH, GOD,

06:39.664 --> 06:40.941
THAT'S COLE. HE CAN'T KNOW
I TOLD YOU

06:41.041 --> 06:42.484
BEFORE I TOLD HIM.

06:42.584 --> 06:43.777
HURRY! OUTTA HERE! ORB!

06:43.877 --> 06:45.237
I THOUGHT COLE HAD
A NO-ORBING POLICY.

06:45.337 --> 06:47.073
NO, HE DOESN'T WANT YOU
ORBING IN.

06:47.173 --> 06:48.448
HE DOESN'T MIND
YOU ORBING OUT.

06:48.548 --> 06:50.176
NOW!

06:52.302 --> 06:55.790
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
AT WORK.

06:55.891 --> 06:58.208
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
IN BED.

06:58.308 --> 07:00.921
ARE YOU FEELING BETTER?

07:01.021 --> 07:02.313
MUCH. THANKS.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.025
WELL, I GOTTA GO, BABY,

07:06.317 --> 07:07.929
YOU KNOW, DEADLINES.

07:08.029 --> 07:09.388
UH, BUT I, UM...

07:09.489 --> 07:10.515
I GOT YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT.

07:10.615 --> 07:11.516
SORRY.

07:11.616 --> 07:12.826
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

07:14.661 --> 07:18.107
PHOEBE, WHAT'S WRONG?

07:18.207 --> 07:18.941
WHY?

07:19.041 --> 07:20.401
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG?

07:20.501 --> 07:22.335
BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU LIE,

07:23.712 --> 07:25.238
I CAN SEE YOUR WISDOM TEETH.

07:25.338 --> 07:26.616
HEH...

07:26.716 --> 07:28.493
WE'LL TALK TONIGHT.

07:28.593 --> 07:29.536
PHOEBE!

07:29.636 --> 07:30.620
PLEASE, COLE,
NOT NOW.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.346
WELL, I'M WORRIED.

07:33.347 --> 07:34.248
WELL, DON'T BE.

07:34.348 --> 07:35.935
WELL, I AM, DAMN IT.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

07:37.186 --> 07:37.352
I'M PREGNANT.

07:40.355 --> 07:42.257
YOU'RE WHAT?

07:42.357 --> 07:43.734
WE'LL TALK LATER.

07:46.822 --> 07:50.266
I'M GONNA BE A DADDY.

07:50.366 --> 07:51.535
[LAUGHS]

07:52.078 --> 07:52.996
WHAT IS THE EMERGENCY?

07:55.372 --> 07:56.983
PHOEBE IS PREGNANT.

07:57.083 --> 07:58.610
WHAT? REALLY?

07:58.710 --> 08:00.196
YEAH, I THINK
SHE DESERVES TO KNOW

08:00.296 --> 08:01.780
SHE'S CARRYING
A DEMON CHILD, DON'T YOU?

08:01.881 --> 08:03.531
YOU DON'T KNOW
IF COLE IS A DEMON.

08:03.631 --> 08:05.910
YOU DON'T KNOW HE'S NOT.

08:06.010 --> 08:07.036
WELL, OK, WE'LL DO
SOME MORE DIGGING,

08:07.136 --> 08:09.122
AND--AND WE'LL FIND
SOME SOLID PROOF.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.916
NO, I THINK SHE DESERVES
TO KNOW NOW, PIPER.

08:11.016 --> 08:13.043
SHE DOESN'T NEED
THE STRESS, PAIGE.

08:13.143 --> 08:14.586
EVEN IF SHE'S IN DANGER?

08:14.686 --> 08:15.754
COLE WOULD
NEVER HURT HER.

08:15.854 --> 08:17.214
HE COULDN'T
EVEN HURT HER
WHEN HE WAS A DEMON.

08:17.315 --> 08:19.258
ARE YOU WILLING
TO BET HER LIFE ON IT?

08:19.358 --> 08:20.675
OK. AHEM.

08:20.775 --> 08:22.261
DO YOU WANT MY ADVICE
OR DON'T YOU?

08:22.361 --> 08:23.679
DEPENDS ON WHOSE SIDE
YOU'RE ON.

08:23.779 --> 08:24.889
AND IF YOU TAKE HERS,
IT BETTER NOT BE

08:24.989 --> 08:26.307
BECAUSE YOU'RE
SLEEPING WITH HER.

08:26.407 --> 08:27.617
WHOA!

08:29.244 --> 08:30.145
PLEASE,
YOU GOTTA HELP ME!

08:30.245 --> 08:31.772
HELP YOU?
WHO ARE YOU?

08:31.872 --> 08:33.456
NO!

08:36.043 --> 08:39.113
WH--

08:39.212 --> 08:40.416
WHAT AN IDIOT! DOESN'T
EVERY DEMON KNOW BY NOW

08:40.426 --> 08:43.076
WHOSE HOUSE THIS IS?

08:43.176 --> 08:44.260
NOT EVERY DEMON.

08:45.470 --> 08:47.122
FORTUNATELY FOR ME.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.790
BUT HE JUST
VANQUISHED YOU.

08:48.891 --> 08:50.332
NO, NOT ME.

08:50.432 --> 08:52.377
AN ILLUSION.

08:52.477 --> 08:53.671
ONE OF MY LITTLE TRICKS.

08:53.771 --> 08:55.338
COMES IN HANDY
FOR SAVING MY LIFE

08:55.438 --> 08:57.340
AND WHATNOT.

08:57.440 --> 08:58.384
YOU'RE A WIZARD?

08:58.484 --> 08:59.677
IN THE FLESH.

08:59.778 --> 09:01.512
FOR LACK
OF A BETTER TERM.

09:01.613 --> 09:03.098
WAIT A MINUTE,
YOU JUST TRICKED US

09:03.198 --> 09:04.474
INTO VANQUISHING
ONE OF YOUR ENEMIES.

09:04.574 --> 09:06.476
MY ENEMIES
ARE YOUR ENEMIES.

09:06.576 --> 09:08.352
[Paige] SAYS YOU.

09:08.452 --> 09:09.604
LEO, FRIEND OR FOE?

09:09.705 --> 09:11.274
I DON'T KNOW. I'VE NEVER
MET A WIZARD BEFORE.

09:11.374 --> 09:13.651
ONLY HEARD ABOUT THEM.

09:13.751 --> 09:14.794
PLEASE! GIVE ME
A LITTLE CREDIT.

09:17.462 --> 09:21.118
WHY WOULD I SEEK OUT
THE CHARMED ONES

09:21.218 --> 09:23.537
IF I WERE EVIL?

09:23.637 --> 09:24.872
OK, LOOK, YOU NEED
TO STAND STILL

09:24.972 --> 09:26.372
OR YOU'RE GONNA GO "POOF"
LIKE YOUR FRIEND IN THERE.

09:26.472 --> 09:28.293
OH.

09:28.393 --> 09:29.543
YOU'RE THE TOUCHY
ONE, AREN'T YOU?

09:29.644 --> 09:32.379
I'VE HEARD
ABOUT YOU.

09:32.479 --> 09:34.174
PEEPER?

09:34.274 --> 09:35.342
PIPER.

09:35.442 --> 09:36.426
WHATEVER.

09:36.526 --> 09:37.444
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

09:38.362 --> 09:40.264
REVENGE.

09:40.364 --> 09:42.267
ON THE SOURCE.

09:42.367 --> 09:43.575
FOR SLAUGHTERING MY KIND
CENTURIES AGO.

09:45.661 --> 09:47.038
AND FOR THAT,
I'LL NEED YOUR HELP.

09:49.498 --> 09:51.360
WELL, MAYBE
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.362
THERE'S A NEW SOURCE.
THE OLD ONE IS DEAD.

09:53.462 --> 09:55.488
YEAH, WE
ALREADY KICKED
HIS SORRY ASS.

09:55.588 --> 09:57.742
HE DIDN'T DIE.

09:57.842 --> 09:59.093
HE WAS REBORN INTO
A NEW SORRY ASS.

10:00.510 --> 10:01.388
WAIT.

10:03.556 --> 10:04.333
THAT DIDN'T
COME OUT RIGHT.

10:04.433 --> 10:05.415
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

10:05.515 --> 10:06.511
AFTER EVERYTHING
WE WENT THROUGH,

10:06.521 --> 10:08.211
HE FOUND AN ESCAPE HATCH?

10:08.311 --> 10:10.356
OUR ONLY CHANCE TO STOP
HIM WILL BE TONIGHT

10:11.648 --> 10:14.093
BEFORE HE RECEIVES
HIS FULL POWERS

10:14.193 --> 10:15.677
AT THE CORONATION.

10:15.778 --> 10:16.804
TONIGHT? HOW DO
WE DO SUCH A BIG JOB

10:16.904 --> 10:18.681
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE?

10:18.781 --> 10:19.891
WE'LL STEAL
<i>THE GRIMOIRE.</i>

10:19.991 --> 10:21.893
OH. WHAT'S THAT?

10:21.993 --> 10:23.436
EVIL <i>BOOK OF SHADOWS.</i>

10:23.536 --> 10:24.520
THE SOURCE
HAS TO LAY HIS HAND

10:24.620 --> 10:26.438
ON THE BOOK
AS HE SAYS THE OATH

10:26.539 --> 10:28.441
OR HE DOESN'T
GET HIS POWERS.

10:28.541 --> 10:30.195
SO WE STEAL
A LITTLE BOOK

10:30.295 --> 10:31.904
AND WE STOP THE SOURCE?

10:32.005 --> 10:34.032
WHAT'S THE CATCH?

10:34.132 --> 10:35.367
THE CATCH IS
IT'S PROTECTED

10:35.467 --> 10:38.036
IN A SECRET CHAMBER
BY HIS BEST GUARDS.

10:38.136 --> 10:40.454
NOW, I KNOW
HOW TO GET THERE,

10:40.554 --> 10:42.707
BUT I CAN'T
FIGHT THEM ALONE.

10:42.808 --> 10:45.311
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
PARTNERS?

10:47.313 --> 10:50.300
I SO DON'T TRUST HIM.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.510
ALL RIGHT, I'LL CHECK
WITH THE ELDERS,

10:52.610 --> 10:54.680
SEE WHAT THEY KNOW.

10:54.780 --> 10:55.597
YOU BETTER GET PHOEBE.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.366
IN CASE HE'S RIGHT,
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
THE POWER OF THREE.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.826
I'LL GO GET HER.

11:01.162 --> 11:02.230
NO. NO, YOU'VE
GOT THE FIREPOWER.

11:02.330 --> 11:04.190
YOU STAY HERE.
I'LL GO.

11:04.290 --> 11:05.482
ALL RIGHT, BUT NO
SPILLING THE BEANS ON COLE,

11:05.582 --> 11:07.902
NOT UNTIL WE DECIDE TO.

11:08.002 --> 11:09.296
SCOUT'S HONOR.

11:09.963 --> 11:10.797
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
ONE FALSE MOVE,

11:13.591 --> 11:16.120
AND YOU'RE TOAST.

11:16.220 --> 11:17.222
MMM.

11:19.099 --> 11:22.435
GOT ANY JAM?

11:24.062 --> 11:27.506
[PLAYING <i>LULLABY
AND GOOD-NIGHT]</i>

11:27.606 --> 11:30.319
[HUMMING ALONG]

11:30.986 --> 11:32.572
[Julie]
IS THE WITCH HOME?

11:34.614 --> 11:35.516
UH...

11:35.616 --> 11:36.517
NO.

11:36.617 --> 11:37.868
GOOD. I THOUGHT
YOU'D LIKE AN UPDATE.

11:39.246 --> 11:42.483
AS YOU ORDERED,
THE PRIESTS HAVE
STEPPED UP SECURITY

11:42.583 --> 11:44.860
ON <i>THE GRIMOIRE.</i>

11:44.960 --> 11:46.362
SO FAR, THE WIZARD HAS
BEEN OUR ONLY BREACH.

11:46.462 --> 11:48.530
WHAT IS
THAT DREADFUL MUSIC?

11:48.630 --> 11:50.450
OH. UH...

11:50.550 --> 11:52.534
NOTHING.

11:52.634 --> 11:53.535
BABY SHOPPING, SIR?

11:53.635 --> 11:55.597
YES. [LAUGHS]
AS A MATTER OF FACT I WAS.

11:56.638 --> 11:58.708
PHOEBE'S PREGNANT.

11:58.809 --> 11:59.960
OH.

12:00.060 --> 12:01.544
AN HEIR, THAT'S, UH--

12:01.644 --> 12:02.921
THAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS,

12:03.021 --> 12:04.006
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE--

12:04.106 --> 12:05.548
I'M JUST...

12:05.648 --> 12:07.343
KEEPING UP APPEARANCES,
YOU KNOW?

12:07.443 --> 12:09.653
TRYING TO ACT LIKE
ANY NORMAL FATHER-TO-BE.

12:10.654 --> 12:12.657
FOR PHOEBE.

12:13.908 --> 12:15.559
BUT PHOEBE'S NOT HERE.

12:15.659 --> 12:17.661
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU NEED TO UPDATE ME ON?

12:19.081 --> 12:21.567
MAY I SPEAK CANDIDLY?

12:21.667 --> 12:24.569
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU,

12:24.669 --> 12:26.198
WORRIED THAT
THE WITCH'S INFLUENCE

12:26.298 --> 12:28.867
ON YOU IS TOO GREAT,

12:28.967 --> 12:31.052
THAT THE BABY WILL
MAKE THE PULL OF LOVE
EVEN GREATER.

12:31.928 --> 12:34.390
OH, IF YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT THE CORONATION--

12:35.724 --> 12:37.626
[SNICKERS]

12:37.727 --> 12:38.836
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
AFTER THE CORONATION.

12:38.936 --> 12:41.856
THE NEXT 9 MONTHS,
TO BE EXACT,

12:42.689 --> 12:46.011
WHEN THE BOND
BETWEEN YOU

12:46.111 --> 12:47.387
AND PHOEBE WILL GROW...

12:47.487 --> 12:49.698
AND YOUR HOLD
ON THE HUMANITY
WITHIN WILL WEAKEN.

12:50.698 --> 12:53.769
UNLESS...

12:53.869 --> 12:56.604
UNLESS?

12:56.705 --> 12:59.608
UNLESS YOU
ALLOW THE SEER

12:59.708 --> 13:01.320
TO PERFORM
HER DARK MAGIC,

13:01.420 --> 13:03.964
ALLOW ME
TO CARRY YOUR BABY.

13:04.256 --> 13:07.451
WHAT?

13:07.552 --> 13:09.203
YOU WON'T NEED
THE WITCH ANYMORE.

13:09.304 --> 13:11.931
I CAN BE YOUR QUEEN.

13:13.766 --> 13:14.476
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND?

13:17.438 --> 13:18.589
I AM TRYING
TO SAVE YOU!

13:18.689 --> 13:20.299
THE UNDERWORLD
WILL NOT TOLERATE

13:20.399 --> 13:21.968
A LEADER
WHO'S CONFLICTED!

13:22.068 --> 13:23.469
ANY SIGN OF WEAKNESS,

13:23.569 --> 13:24.635
AND YOU'RE
NOT GONNA SURVIVE.

13:24.736 --> 13:26.490
ARE YOU
THREATENING ME?

13:27.574 --> 13:29.641
I'M REMINDING YOU

13:29.741 --> 13:31.853
OF YOUR FUTURE,

13:31.954 --> 13:32.938
YOUR DESTINY.

13:33.038 --> 13:34.248
NEITHER OF WHICH
INCLUDE THE WITCH.

13:48.430 --> 13:51.792
YES,
OF COURSE I AM AWARE

13:51.892 --> 13:53.377
THAT THERE'S A DEADLINE,

13:53.477 --> 13:54.461
BUT ELISE
THREW MY COLUMN OUT

13:54.562 --> 13:55.670
AT THE LAST MINUTE!

13:55.770 --> 13:58.133
OH!

13:58.233 --> 13:59.134
OH, HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

13:59.234 --> 14:00.759
TO WRITE
AN ADVICE COLUMN?

14:00.860 --> 14:02.779
LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW HARD.

14:04.780 --> 14:07.893
BAD TIME?

14:07.993 --> 14:09.312
YES. UH, NO.

14:09.412 --> 14:11.022
WHATEVER.
WHAT IS IT?

14:11.122 --> 14:12.732
UH, WELL...

14:12.832 --> 14:13.858
WE, UH...

14:13.958 --> 14:15.485
WE NEED
THE POWER OF THREE.

14:15.585 --> 14:16.693
WHAT?

14:16.793 --> 14:18.197
NOW? CAN'T IT WAIT?

14:18.297 --> 14:19.696
CLIFF

14:19.796 --> 14:21.325
WE DIDN'T KILL THE SOURCE
LIKE WE THOUGHT.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.035
HE WAS JUST REBORN.

14:23.135 --> 14:24.077
AND NOW IF
WE DON'T HELP A WIZARD

14:24.177 --> 14:25.703
STOP HIM FROM
GETTING CORONATED TONIGHT,

14:25.803 --> 14:27.290
HE BECOMES ALL-POWERFUL.

14:27.390 --> 14:29.083
SHALL WE?

14:29.183 --> 14:30.084
SO LET HIM
GET CORONATED.

14:30.184 --> 14:32.253
SORRY?

14:32.353 --> 14:35.691
WELL, WHY NOT?
WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT CAN HAPPEN?UH, BESIDES ALL HELL
BREAKING LOOSE ON EARTH?

14:35.814 --> 14:38.235
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

14:39.153 --> 14:40.404
I DON'T KNOW.

14:41.821 --> 14:43.073
[SIGHS] I'M JUST...

14:44.824 --> 14:45.863
I'M HAVING A REALLY
BAD DAY RIGHT NOW.

14:45.873 --> 14:47.827
OK, UH, I'LL MEET
YOU AT THE MANOR,

14:49.039 --> 14:50.731
BUT I HAVE
TO FIND COLE FIRST

14:50.831 --> 14:51.732
AND FILL HIM IN.

14:51.832 --> 14:52.943
NO, YOU DON'T NEED
TO DO THAT.

14:53.043 --> 14:54.654
BESIDES, HE'S SO BUSY
BEING MR. HOTSHOT
LAWYER GUY AND ALL.

14:54.754 --> 14:57.615
OK, PAIGE,
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM
WITH COLE NOW?

14:57.715 --> 14:59.741
HUH? SPILL IT.

14:59.841 --> 15:00.868
NOTHING.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.161
YOU'RE LYING. I CAN SEE
YOUR WISDOM TEETH.

15:02.261 --> 15:04.746
I DON'T HAVE
WISDOM TEETH.

15:04.846 --> 15:05.747
PAIGE.

15:05.847 --> 15:06.933
ALL RIGHT, BUT
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE IT.

15:08.060 --> 15:09.519
ALL RIGHT.

15:11.146 --> 15:14.509
REMEMBER THE VAMPIRE
THAT ATTACKED ME
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO?WELL, I MET HIM
THROUGH COLE

15:14.609 --> 15:16.052
AT YOUR APARTMENT.

15:16.152 --> 15:18.054
AND?

15:18.154 --> 15:19.568
AND? DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG COINCIDENCE

15:19.578 --> 15:21.808
FOR AN ALLEGED EX-DEMON?

15:21.908 --> 15:23.017
ALLEGED?

15:23.118 --> 15:24.103
STOP BEING SO NAIVE,
PHOEBE.

15:24.203 --> 15:25.479
HE'S BEEN ACTING STRANGE

15:25.579 --> 15:26.480
EVER SINCE
HE GOT HIS NEW JOB,

15:26.580 --> 15:27.772
WHICH, FOR ALL WE KNOW,
COULD BE A COVER ANYWAY.

15:27.872 --> 15:30.775
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

15:30.875 --> 15:31.528
FACE THE FACTS, PHOEBE.

15:31.628 --> 15:32.777
COLE HAS GONE BACK
TO HIS OLD WAYS.

15:32.877 --> 15:35.781
AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO THINKS SO.

15:35.881 --> 15:37.926
PIPER THINKS SO, TOO.

15:39.470 --> 15:42.623
THAT'S WHAT
WE WERE COMING

15:42.723 --> 15:43.641
TO TELL YOU ABOUT
THIS MORNING.

15:46.268 --> 15:49.564
I'M SORRY.

15:50.774 --> 15:53.844
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

15:53.944 --> 15:55.178
TO PROVE YOU WRONG.

15:55.278 --> 15:56.471
WHAT ABOUT THE SOURCE?

15:56.572 --> 15:57.557
WHAT ABOUT
THE POWER OF THREE?

15:57.657 --> 15:58.990
SCREW
THE POWER OF THREE.

16:37.617 --> 16:40.953
[SQUEAKING]

17:05.940 --> 17:08.884
OH.

17:08.984 --> 17:10.886
YOU CAUGHT ME.

17:10.986 --> 17:12.405
COLE.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.538
I LOVE YOU.

17:37.141 --> 17:40.712
SCREW THE POWER
OF THREE?

17:40.812 --> 17:43.882
THOSE WERE
HER WORDS EXACTLY.

17:43.982 --> 17:45.801
AND THEN SHE
PRACTICALLY FLATTENED ME

17:45.901 --> 17:47.469
WHILE STORMING OUT
OF HER OFFICE.

17:47.569 --> 17:49.138
WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
MORE THAN JUST HORMONES.

17:49.238 --> 17:52.932
YEAH. SHE WAS
A LITTLE PISSED.

17:53.032 --> 17:54.577
ABOUT WHAT?

17:55.537 --> 17:56.621
OH, PAIGE,
YOU DIDN'T!

17:57.831 --> 18:00.941
YOU TOLD HER
ABOUT COLE?

18:01.041 --> 18:02.736
SHE WAS GONNA
FIND OUT EVENTUALLY.

18:02.836 --> 18:04.208
YEAH, WHEN WE DECIDED
IT WAS THE RIGHT TIME
TO TELL HER!

18:04.218 --> 18:07.116
AND NOW SHE'S PROBABLY
NEVER GONNA SPEAK
TO US AGAIN.

18:07.216 --> 18:09.368
YOU MIGHT AS WELL CROWN
THE NEW SOURCE YOURSELF!

18:09.469 --> 18:11.580
OH, GOD, I THINK YOU'RE
SLIGHTLY EXAGGERATING.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.582
NO, I AM NOT!
WE NEED PHOEBE

18:13.682 --> 18:15.958
FOR THE PLAN
TO WORK!

18:16.058 --> 18:17.060
-WHAT PLAN?
-YOU FOLLOW ME!

18:23.609 --> 18:26.847
ALL RIGHT.

18:26.947 --> 18:28.071
PIPER, I THINK I LIKE
THE OTHER KITCHEN BETTER.

18:28.114 --> 18:31.727
THIS IS AN ILLUSION, RIGHT?

18:31.827 --> 18:33.870
[Wizard] PLEASE.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.075
TELL ME SHE'S NOT
THE BRAINS OF THE FAMILY.

18:36.085 --> 18:38.860
<i>GRIMOIRE,</i>

18:38.960 --> 18:39.819
DARK PRIEST, BODYGUARDS,

18:39.919 --> 18:41.571
AND THIS MYSTERY MAN
OVER HERE IS THE SOURCE.

18:41.671 --> 18:43.156
OH.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.240
FIRST HALF A FACE
AND NOW NO FACE.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.034
I DIDN'T GET
A GOOD LOOK AT HIM.

18:46.134 --> 18:47.495
WELL, IT DOESN'T
REALLY MATTER ANYWAY,

18:47.595 --> 18:48.994
BECAUSE HE MAY
NOT EVEN BE HERE.

18:49.094 --> 18:50.414
ALL WE WANT
IS <i>THE GRIMOIRE.</i>

18:50.514 --> 18:51.832
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

18:51.932 --> 18:53.083
WE LEARN FROM HIS MISTAKES.

18:53.183 --> 18:54.502
NOT MISTAKES.

18:54.602 --> 18:56.128
MISCALCULATIONS.

18:56.228 --> 18:57.506
UH, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE ANY BACKUP,

18:57.606 --> 18:59.716
YOUR ILLUSIONS
DIDN'T BUY YOU ENOUGH TIME,

18:59.816 --> 19:01.801
AND YOU GOT CAUGHT.

19:01.901 --> 19:02.887
I'D CALL THOSE MISTAKES.

19:02.987 --> 19:04.596
THIS TIME WE'LL GO
FOR A BIGGER DISTRACTION,

19:04.697 --> 19:07.014
AND SINCE THE BODYGUARDS
ARE ALREADY AFTER YOU,

19:07.114 --> 19:09.016
YOU SHOW UP, AND THEY'RE
BOUND TO CHASE AFTER YOU.

19:09.116 --> 19:11.604
THINNING OUT
THE DEMONIC RANKS.

19:11.704 --> 19:12.898
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

19:12.998 --> 19:13.899
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

19:13.999 --> 19:14.983
YOU'RE NOT
THE DISTRACTION.

19:15.083 --> 19:17.025
YOU'LL ORB US IN,

19:17.125 --> 19:18.206
PHOEBE AND I WILL
KEEP THE DEMONS BUSY,

19:18.216 --> 19:20.364
AND YOU'LL SNAG THE BOOK.

19:20.464 --> 19:21.365
[Paige] SOUNDS SIMPLE.

19:21.465 --> 19:22.842
WOULD I COME TO YOU

19:24.301 --> 19:26.035
IF IT WERE THAT SIMPLE?

19:26.135 --> 19:27.539
IT'S LIKE
THE <i>BOOK OF SHADOWS,</i>

19:27.639 --> 19:29.082
ONLY IT PROTECTS ITSELF
FROM GOOD,

19:29.182 --> 19:31.209
SO YOU'LL USE THIS SACK.

19:31.309 --> 19:33.336
WE'LL PUT A SPELL ON IT

19:33.436 --> 19:34.547
SO IT CAN HOLD
<i>THE GRIMOIRE.</i>

19:34.647 --> 19:35.798
PIPER!

19:35.898 --> 19:36.940
PHOEBE!

19:39.526 --> 19:42.931
HELLO. CONFUSION.

19:43.031 --> 19:44.975
I CAN'T WORK
LIKE THIS.

19:45.075 --> 19:46.518
PHOEBE,
THIS IS THE WIZARD,

19:46.618 --> 19:48.812
AND THAT WAS
ONE OF HIS ILLUSIONS.

19:48.912 --> 19:50.956
AN ILLUSION.

19:53.165 --> 19:56.111
UM...

19:56.212 --> 19:57.113
LIKE THOSE?

19:57.213 --> 19:58.239
YEAH. DON'T MIND HIM.

19:58.339 --> 19:59.574
HE'S BEEN AT IT
ALL DAY, THE PIG.

19:59.674 --> 20:02.536
NOT THAT I'M NOT
HAPPY TO SEE YOU,
PHOEBE, BUT...

20:02.636 --> 20:04.871
WHY <i>ARE
</i> WE SEEING YOU,

20:04.971 --> 20:06.079
CONSIDERING
HOW WE LEFT IT?

20:06.180 --> 20:08.082
I'M NOT ABOUT TO SHUN
MY WICCAN DUTIES, PAIGE,

20:08.182 --> 20:10.252
NO MATTER WHAT.

20:10.352 --> 20:11.253
BUT WHAT ABOUT...

20:11.353 --> 20:13.464
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT?

20:13.564 --> 20:15.341
I LOVE COLE,

20:15.441 --> 20:16.593
AND I TRUST HIM,

20:16.693 --> 20:17.594
EVEN IF YOU GUYS DON'T.

20:17.694 --> 20:19.095
AND WE CAN DISCUSS
OUR PROBLEMS LATER.

20:19.195 --> 20:20.598
I CAME HERE
TO HELP YOU WITH...

20:20.698 --> 20:22.683
MERLIN.

20:22.783 --> 20:23.684
PLEASE.

20:23.784 --> 20:25.101
MERLIN WAS
AN OVERRATED HACK.

20:25.201 --> 20:27.103
TELL ME HE'S
NOT THE ONLY WIZARD

20:27.203 --> 20:28.230
YOU PEOPLE
HAVE EVER HEARD OF.

20:28.330 --> 20:29.816
WELL, DOES
HARRY POTTER COUNT?

20:29.916 --> 20:31.191
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH.
YOU CAN LIVE YOUR LIFE

20:31.291 --> 20:33.193
OF INSTANT GRATIFICATION
LATER

20:33.294 --> 20:34.904
AFTER WE'RE DONE.

20:35.004 --> 20:35.905
GET RID OF THEM.

20:36.006 --> 20:36.991
YOU CALL THIS A LIFE?

20:37.091 --> 20:39.176
THIS IS NO LIFE.

20:40.343 --> 20:41.637
ILLUSIONS
ARE AS EMPTY TO ME

20:43.181 --> 20:44.540
AS THEY ARE TO YOU.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.459
THEY'RE ONLY A REMINDER

20:46.559 --> 20:47.460
OF A REALITY
LONG SINCE LOST...

20:47.560 --> 20:50.312
OF A WORLD FILLED
WITH WIZARDS,

20:51.314 --> 20:54.551
OF FRIENDS,

20:54.651 --> 20:55.970
OF FAMILY.

20:56.070 --> 20:57.236
IT'S ALL AN ILLUSION
WITHOUT FAMILY.

21:01.868 --> 21:05.413
[Wizard] HELP ME
STOP THE SOURCE.

21:05.705 --> 21:07.415
HELP ME RIGHT THIS WRONG.

21:13.254 --> 21:16.910
[Dark Priest]
EVERYTHING'S ON SCHEDULE.

21:17.010 --> 21:18.590
THE OTHER PRIESTS ARE
PREPARING THE SACRIFICES
AS WE SPEAK.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.665
AND WHAT
ABOUT THE WIZARD?

21:21.765 --> 21:23.000
HOW DO WE KNOW HE WON'T
MAKE ANOTHER ATTEMPT?

21:23.100 --> 21:24.794
HE'S THE LAST
OF HIS KIND, SIRE.

21:24.894 --> 21:26.754
I DOUBT IF
HE'LL RISK OBLIVION.

21:26.854 --> 21:28.270
HE RISKED IT BEFORE,
DIDN'T HE?

21:30.065 --> 21:31.776
[Wizard] TALKIN' ABOUT ME?

21:33.276 --> 21:34.445
GUARDS! AFTER HIM!

21:38.450 --> 21:41.770
SOMETHING'S
NOT RIGHT.

21:41.870 --> 21:44.207
YOU SHOULD LEAVE
FOR YOUR SAFETY NOW, SIRE.

21:45.082 --> 21:46.333
PROTECT <i>THE GRIMOIRE.</i>

21:54.509 --> 21:57.679
GRR!

22:06.312 --> 22:09.467
[Cole] STOP.

22:09.567 --> 22:10.468
WAIT.

22:10.568 --> 22:11.761
BUT, SIRE,
THE WIZARD--

22:11.862 --> 22:13.530
HE'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

22:17.785 --> 22:20.856
AH.

22:20.956 --> 22:22.165
IF ONLY
YOU WERE REAL.

22:32.760 --> 22:36.097
PIPER, NOW!

22:38.183 --> 22:41.352
PAIGE, LOOK OUT!

22:45.691 --> 22:48.970
WHAT WAS THAT?

22:49.070 --> 22:50.697
I HAVE NO IDEA.

22:52.115 --> 22:53.241
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

22:55.451 --> 22:56.352
<i>GRIMOIRE!</i>

22:56.452 --> 22:58.038
GOT IT!

22:59.414 --> 23:00.498
LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE.

23:04.254 --> 23:07.280
WE DID IT!

23:07.380 --> 23:08.825
WE GOT IT!

23:08.925 --> 23:10.283
YES, AND NOW WE'RE
GOING TO DESTROY IT.

23:10.383 --> 23:12.285
PAIGE, GO GET
THE <i>BOOK OF SHADOWS.</i>

23:12.386 --> 23:13.287
WE NEED
SOME POTIONS.

23:13.387 --> 23:14.331
RIGHT.

23:14.431 --> 23:15.457
WAIT. DESTROY IT?

23:15.557 --> 23:17.291
WE MIGHT
BE ABLE TO USE IT.

23:17.391 --> 23:19.086
FOR WHAT?
IT'S EVIL.

23:19.186 --> 23:21.214
DO YOU WANNA
SIT DOWN?

23:21.314 --> 23:22.215
I THINK I JUST
WANNA GO HOME.

23:22.316 --> 23:23.299
WELL, THIS
IS HOME, TOO.

23:23.399 --> 23:25.300
I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.428
THAT JUST
DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT.

23:27.528 --> 23:29.404
WELL, THAT'S PROBABLY
JUST BECAUSE IT'S--

23:30.949 --> 23:32.308
IT'S NEW, AND YOUR POWER
IS ESCALATING--

23:32.408 --> 23:34.812
HOW IS IT ESCALATING?

23:34.912 --> 23:36.915
I LEVITATE.
I HAVE PREMONITIONS.

23:37.413 --> 23:40.293
WELL, YOU HAD FIREPOWER
IN YOUR PAST LIFE.

23:41.337 --> 23:43.613
I WAS EVIL
IN MY PAST LIFE.

23:43.713 --> 23:45.573
REMEMBER?

23:45.673 --> 23:46.759
CAN WE GET BACK
TO <i>THE GRIMOIRE?</i>

23:48.719 --> 23:51.038
NO!

23:51.138 --> 23:52.223
PHOEBE, WAIT.

24:03.485 --> 24:07.181
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHAT HAPPENED?

24:07.281 --> 24:09.449
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

24:10.868 --> 24:11.978
I SENSED YOUR PAIN.
I WAS WORRIED.

24:12.079 --> 24:14.355
YEAH, WELL,
YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED.

24:14.455 --> 24:16.859
<i>THE GRIMOIRE'S
</i> BEEN STOLEN.

24:16.959 --> 24:18.944
I KNOW.

24:19.044 --> 24:20.128
YOU KNOW?
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

24:21.880 --> 24:23.464
HAVE YOU BEEN
SPYING ON ME?

24:24.842 --> 24:26.344
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

24:26.552 --> 24:27.887
THEN HOW?

24:29.847 --> 24:30.932
TELL ME.

24:32.725 --> 24:33.811
[Woman] FROM ME.

24:36.146 --> 24:37.480
I TOLD HER.

24:38.441 --> 24:40.176
SEER?

24:40.276 --> 24:42.137
IF YOU FORESAW
<i>THE GRIMOIRE
</i> BEING TAKEN--

24:42.237 --> 24:44.072
FINDING <i>THE GRIMOIRE</i> IS
NOT YOUR BIGGEST PROBLEM.

24:45.657 --> 24:47.575
SUPPRESSING COLE IS.

24:49.203 --> 24:51.230
YOU'RE CHANGING,
MY LIEGE.

24:51.330 --> 24:53.440
THE HUMAN IN YOU
GROWS STRONGER

24:53.540 --> 24:55.500
AND AT THE WORST
POSSIBLE TIME.

24:56.501 --> 24:58.045
I CAN HANDLE IT.

24:59.672 --> 25:00.573
HOW? YOUR GUARD IS DOWN.

25:00.673 --> 25:02.993
YOU'RE VULNERABLE.

25:03.093 --> 25:04.244
LET ME TRY AGAIN.

25:04.344 --> 25:06.204
TRY WHAT?

25:06.305 --> 25:07.497
ARE YOU WORKING TOGETHER
TO MANIPULATE ME?

25:07.597 --> 25:10.001
NO. TO SAVE YOU.

25:10.101 --> 25:11.417
TO SAVE US.

25:11.517 --> 25:12.586
US? THERE IS NO US!

25:12.687 --> 25:14.297
BUT THERE COULD BE.

25:14.397 --> 25:15.341
AND IF THERE WERE,

25:15.441 --> 25:16.383
THE STRUGGLE WOULD END.

25:16.483 --> 25:17.967
YOU'D BE FREE TO RULE

25:18.068 --> 25:19.319
WITHOUT THE WITCH'S LOVE
HOLDING YOU BACK.

25:20.528 --> 25:21.528
THIS IS YOUR DOING.

25:24.033 --> 25:25.517
DID YOU REALLY THINK
I'D FALL FOR IT?

25:25.617 --> 25:28.436
LEAVE US.

25:28.536 --> 25:29.621
NOW.

25:39.674 --> 25:43.329
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TRICKED ME

25:43.430 --> 25:44.455
INTO HIRING
A SEDUCTRESS.

25:44.555 --> 25:46.916
I WAS CONCERNED
THE BABY'S INFLUENCE

25:47.017 --> 25:48.709
ON YOUR HUMANITY MIGHT
SWAY YOU TO THE OTHER SIDE.

25:48.810 --> 25:51.755
AND WHAT?

25:51.855 --> 25:54.300
YOU HOPED
IF I'D GOTTEN LAID--

25:54.400 --> 25:55.592
NO. I HOPED YOU'D
COME TO YOUR SENSES

25:55.692 --> 25:58.012
BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE.

25:58.112 --> 25:59.405

RELYING ON IT.

JUST ABOUT YOU.

TO LET YOU FAIL NOW.

IT'S ONLY THE SOURCE
THAT PROTECTS YOU

26:09.958 --> 26:12.069
FROM THE CHARMED ONES'
POWERS AND PREMONITIONS.

26:12.169 --> 26:14.755
IF COLE'S LOVE
BECOMES ANY STRONGER,

26:15.423 --> 26:17.784
IT WILL OVERPOWER
THE SOURCE.

26:17.884 --> 26:19.593
THEN YOU WILL
LOSE EVERYTHING.

OH.

26:41.076 --> 26:42.353

26:42.453 --> 26:43.438

HAS HAPPENED TO ME.

27:03.059 --> 27:04.961
NO.

27:05.061 --> 27:07.063
THE BABY'S FINE.

27:07.646 --> 27:11.068

IT'S NOT GOOD.

HE WANTS <i>THE GRIMOIRE

30:13.269 --> 30:15.754
PROBABLY.
THERE'S A SPELL IN THERE

30:15.854 --> 30:17.799

TO RESURRECT HIS PEOPLE.

31:24.973 --> 31:27.226
THAT'S AN AWFUL LOT
TO ASK OF HER RIGHT NOW.

31:28.935 --> 31:31.339
I KNOW, BUT
WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE?

31:31.439 --> 31:32.940
THERE'S GONNA BE
A CORONATION TONIGHT
UNLESS WE STOP IT.

31:40.948 --> 31:44.061
HOW'S IT FEEL?

31:44.162 --> 31:45.538
HEAVY.

31:54.256 --> 31:57.368
FOCUS.

31:57.468 --> 31:58.868
AH, WHAT'S THE POINT?
WE DON'T EVEN
HAVE <i>THE GRIMOIRE.</i>

31:58.968 --> 32:00.870
WE WILL.

32:00.970 --> 32:02.290
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU MUST KEEP UP
APPEARANCES.

32:02.390 --> 32:05.710
BUT PHOEBE--

32:05.810 --> 32:06.877
IS NOT YOUR CONCERN
AT THE MOMENT.

32:06.977 --> 32:08.505
SHE KNOWS I'M A DEMON,
DAMN IT.

32:08.606 --> 32:10.023
SHE WILL COME AROUND
IN TIME.

32:12.568 --> 32:15.887
I CAN'T DO THIS.
I HAVE TO FIND HER.

32:15.987 --> 32:19.058
AND RISK THE WIZARD
FINDING YOU?

32:19.158 --> 32:21.893
HE'LL KILL YOU,

32:21.993 --> 32:24.147
TAKE YOUR THRONE.

32:24.247 --> 32:25.817
HE CAN HAVE IT.

32:25.917 --> 32:27.234
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOUR DEATH WILL SOLVE?

32:27.334 --> 32:30.903
DO YOU REALLY THINK
IT'LL BRING YOU
WHAT YOU SEEK?

32:31.003 --> 32:33.907
IF LOSING THE WITCH
HAS COST YOU YOUR WILL,

32:34.007 --> 32:37.303
THEN <i>I</i> WILL GET IT BACK.

32:39.973 --> 32:43.143
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

32:48.022 --> 32:51.261
[Leo] ANYTHING?

32:51.361 --> 32:52.679
HE'S NOT HERE.

32:52.779 --> 32:53.848
DID YOU TRY
HIS OFFICE?

32:53.948 --> 32:55.114
I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER
IF HE EVEN HAS AN OFFICE.

32:56.659 --> 32:57.451
HE DOES.

32:59.912 --> 33:01.647
WHO ARE YOU?

33:01.747 --> 33:03.374
I KNOW WHO SHE IS.

33:04.793 --> 33:05.942
WHERE'S COLE?

33:06.042 --> 33:07.027
SAFE...FROM YOU.

33:07.127 --> 33:09.946
ALL RIGHT, YOU WANNA
PUNCH HER, OR SHOULD I?

33:10.047 --> 33:12.551
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
ALL ALONG.

33:13.593 --> 33:15.496
YOU RUINED HIM,
MADE HIM
PATHETIC, WEAK...

33:15.596 --> 33:18.791
GOOD.

33:18.891 --> 33:20.543
AND I TAKE IT YOU
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

33:20.643 --> 33:22.336
YEAH, I HAVE A BIG
PROBLEM WITH THAT.

33:22.436 --> 33:23.962
UH, PHOEBE,
WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?

33:24.062 --> 33:27.133
YOU'RE JUST A MEANS
TO AN END,

33:27.234 --> 33:29.178
A WAY TO SIRE
A MAGICAL CHILD,

33:29.278 --> 33:31.864
BUT NOW
YOU'RE HURTING HIM,
AND I CAN'T ALLOW THAT.

33:32.031 --> 33:34.974
OH, NO?

33:35.074 --> 33:37.395
NO.

33:37.495 --> 33:38.998
WHOO!

33:40.331 --> 33:41.792
2 CAN PLAY AT THAT GAME.

33:43.083 --> 33:44.628
OK, ENOUGH--
[Phoebe]
PIPER, DON'T.

33:46.422 --> 33:48.574
THIS IS MY FIGHT.

33:48.674 --> 33:49.968
AAH!

33:51.218 --> 33:52.495
[Piper] PHOEBE?
[JULIE SCREAMS]

33:52.596 --> 33:54.706
AAH!

33:54.806 --> 33:55.807
AAH!

33:57.099 --> 34:00.128
HOME-WRECKER.

34:00.228 --> 34:02.004
OK, PHOEBE,
YOU'RE SCARING US.

34:02.104 --> 34:05.008
WHAT?

34:05.108 --> 34:07.111
PHOEBE, FIRE-THROWING
IS AN UPPER-LEVEL
DEMONIC POWER.

34:08.989 --> 34:12.099
OH, MY GOD.

34:12.199 --> 34:14.328
WHAT'S
HAPPENING TO ME?

34:15.661 --> 34:16.455
HUHH.

34:18.875 --> 34:19.958
UHH!

34:25.130 --> 34:28.159
[GASPS]

34:28.259 --> 34:29.385
BREATHE.

34:30.638 --> 34:32.056
HOW DID I GET HERE?

34:33.138 --> 34:34.958
THROUGH MAGIC.

34:35.060 --> 34:38.145
DARK MAGIC.

34:38.772 --> 34:40.607
YOU JUST...

34:42.108 --> 34:43.301
STAY AWAY FROM ME.

34:43.400 --> 34:44.971
STOP ME.

34:45.071 --> 34:47.154
UHH!

34:51.744 --> 34:55.063
FEELS GOOD, DOESN'T IT?

34:55.163 --> 34:56.775
OR MORE PRECISELY...

34:56.875 --> 34:59.067
EVIL.

34:59.167 --> 35:01.070
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

35:01.170 --> 35:02.823
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?

35:02.923 --> 35:04.951
WHAT I'VE DONE
IS NOT IMPORTANT.

35:05.051 --> 35:08.137
WHAT YOU MUST DO NOW,
HOWEVER, IS.

35:08.513 --> 35:12.083
YOUR HUSBAND
NEEDS YOU BY HIS SIDE.

35:12.183 --> 35:15.085
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

35:15.185 --> 35:17.088
DON'T YOU?

35:17.188 --> 35:18.591
YOU AND I
SHARE THE SAME GIFT.

35:18.691 --> 35:21.091
WE BOTH CAN SENSE
THE TRUTH.

35:21.192 --> 35:24.055
FROM THE MOMENT
COLE ABSORBED
THE SOURCE'S POWER,

35:24.155 --> 35:26.407
YOU'VE SENSED SOMETHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT HIM,

35:26.908 --> 35:30.620
SOMETHING THAT'S
CHANGED HIM FOREVER.

35:32.288 --> 35:33.082
YOU KNOW THE TRUTH.

35:37.086 --> 35:38.421
COLE IS THE SOURCE.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.115
YES.

35:42.215 --> 35:44.117
AND HE NEEDS YOUR HELP
IF HE HOPES TO SURVIVE.

35:44.217 --> 35:47.414
HE NEEDS YOUR LOVE.

35:47.514 --> 35:49.122
YOU CAN'T
KEEP FIGHTING IT.

35:49.223 --> 35:52.126
THE MATERNAL BOND
IS TOO STRONG.

35:52.226 --> 35:54.171
LISTEN TO YOUR BODY,
PHOEBE.

35:54.271 --> 35:57.024
LISTEN
TO YOUR UNBORN SON.

35:57.567 --> 36:01.136
HE TAKES
AFTER HIS FATHER.

36:01.236 --> 36:03.222
HIS FATHER LIED TO ME.

36:03.322 --> 36:05.140
HE NEVER LIED ABOUT
HIS FEELINGS FOR YOU.

36:05.240 --> 36:08.145
AND DESPITE
MY BEST EFFORTS,

36:08.245 --> 36:10.748
HE NEVER
STOPPED LOVING YOU.

36:12.332 --> 36:13.249
OH...YOUR SON...

36:15.754 --> 36:18.156
WAS CONCEIVED IN LOVE,
YOU KNOW THAT.

36:18.256 --> 36:21.242
IT'S TIME
TO STOP FIGHTING IT.

36:21.342 --> 36:24.430
IT'S TIME TO EMBRACE
YOUR NEW FAMILY,
YOUR NEW DESTINY.

36:26.932 --> 36:30.544
OTHERWISE, COLE...
AND YOUR SON WILL DIE.

36:30.644 --> 36:34.191
ALL OF DEMONDOM WILL
RISE UP AGAINST THEM
TO DESTROY THEM

36:35.692 --> 36:38.946
AND YOU.

36:45.285 --> 36:48.314
LEAVE ME.

36:48.414 --> 36:51.359
BUT THE CORONATION
IS IMMINENT.

36:51.459 --> 36:53.193
THE WIZARD--

36:53.293 --> 36:53.946
KNOWS THAT. I KNOW.

36:54.046 --> 36:55.339
LEAVE.

37:08.603 --> 37:11.982
RA-A-A-AH!

37:17.823 --> 37:21.224
I KNEW YOU'D COME FOR ME.

37:21.324 --> 37:23.078
AH!

37:24.496 --> 37:28.416
IF YOU WANTED MY POWERS,
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS ASK.

37:47.353 --> 37:50.592
HOW MUCH LONGER?

37:50.692 --> 37:51.855
GIMME A BREAK, WILL YA?
THIS IS TRICKY STUFF.

37:51.865 --> 37:54.512
BE A LOT EASIER
IF I COULD DO THIS
IN FRIENDLIER CONFINES.

37:54.612 --> 37:57.183
THERE ARE
NO FRIENDLY CONFINES,
NOT ANYMORE.

37:57.283 --> 38:00.060
THIS HAD BETTER WORK,

38:00.160 --> 38:01.269
OR YOU'LL BE JOINING
THE REST OF YOUR KIND,

38:01.369 --> 38:03.148
AND NOT IN THE WAY
YOU'D HOPED FOR.

38:03.248 --> 38:04.273
LITTLE TIP--

38:04.373 --> 38:05.614
PRESSURE'S NOT THE BEST
MOTIVATING TECHNIQUE.

38:05.714 --> 38:08.111
IF YOU WANT TO LOSE
THE SOURCE'S POWERS,

38:08.211 --> 38:10.239
DON'T RUSH ME.

38:10.339 --> 38:11.715
FINE, BUT
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,

38:13.134 --> 38:15.410
ONCE YOU GET
THE SOURCE'S POWERS,

38:15.510 --> 38:17.830
I NEVER HEAR
FROM YOU AGAIN.

38:17.930 --> 38:19.665
UNDERSTOOD.

38:19.765 --> 38:21.876
NOT THAT I'M UNGRATEFUL,

38:21.977 --> 38:23.979
BUT WHY ARE YOU
SO WILLING TO DO THIS?

38:24.394 --> 38:26.481
I LOST SOMEONE I LOVE,
AND I WANT HER BACK.

38:28.150 --> 38:31.054
THAT'S ALL
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

38:31.154 --> 38:32.989
LOVE?

38:33.948 --> 38:35.033
THE SOURCE CAN LOVE.

38:36.492 --> 38:38.745
JUST KEEP WORKING.

38:39.204 --> 38:40.538
I'M DONE.

38:42.414 --> 38:44.068
NOW...

38:44.168 --> 38:45.778
IF THE SPELL'S
GOING TO WORK...

38:45.878 --> 38:49.422
BLOOD NEEDS TO SPILL.

38:58.351 --> 39:01.435
NOW ME.

39:03.898 --> 39:07.593
[CHANTING]
<i>MALUS INTO EXITUS OMNE...</i>

39:07.693 --> 39:11.446
<i>MALUS INTO EXITUS OMNE.</i>

39:12.157 --> 39:15.869
[ECHOING]
<i>MALUS INTO EXITUS OMNE.</i>

39:16.828 --> 39:20.456
<i>MALUS INTO EXITUS OMNE.</i>

39:25.462 --> 39:28.466
[GASPS]

39:31.469 --> 39:34.665
SAVE HIM.

39:34.765 --> 39:36.267
FOR YOUR SON.

39:39.729 --> 39:40.105
AAH!

39:50.324 --> 39:54.145
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO BACK
DOWN TO THE UNDERWORLD.

39:54.246 --> 39:56.647
I ALREADY TRIED.

39:56.747 --> 39:57.858
I CAN'T
SENSE HER ANYWHERE.

39:57.958 --> 39:59.499
WELL, SHE'S
GOTTA BE SOMEWHERE.

40:00.419 --> 40:02.129
DOESN'T SHE?

40:03.547 --> 40:05.506
GOT HER.

40:06.092 --> 40:06.633
ARE YOU OK?

40:09.470 --> 40:11.414
WHAT HAPPENED?

40:11.514 --> 40:13.167
WHAT DID YOU DO?

40:13.267 --> 40:14.626
I VANQUISHED HIM.

40:14.726 --> 40:16.879
OH, BUT
HE WAS OUR LAST CHANCE.

40:16.979 --> 40:20.090
NO, IT WASN'T.

40:20.190 --> 40:22.026
OH! THANK GOD
WE FOUND YOU.

40:24.903 --> 40:26.072
IT'S TOO LATE.

40:28.283 --> 40:29.437
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

40:29.538 --> 40:31.535
HEY! I THOUGHT
ONLY EVIL COULD
TOUCH THAT BOOK.

40:33.205 --> 40:36.125
THAT'S RIGHT.

40:37.126 --> 40:38.544
PHOEBE,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

40:40.545 --> 40:42.507
I'M EMBRACING
MY NEW DESTINY.

40:47.471 --> 40:50.749
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT?

40:50.849 --> 40:53.294
[The Seer] THAT...

40:53.394 --> 40:54.921
WAS THE SOURCE.

40:55.021 --> 40:57.715
AND HIS QUEEN.

40:57.815 --> 40:59.634
YOU DID THIS.

40:59.734 --> 41:01.178
YOU POISONED
HER.

41:01.278 --> 41:03.030
MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST VANQUISH YOU.

41:04.323 --> 41:06.016
YOU CAN'T.

41:06.116 --> 41:07.575
NOT WITHOUT
THE POWER OF THREE.

41:10.662 --> 41:13.900
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.902
LEO, WHERE'D SHE GO?

41:16.002 --> 41:18.238
I CAN'T SENSE HER.

41:18.339 --> 41:19.756
THEY MUST BE
IN THE UNDERWORLD.

41:20.924 --> 41:22.034
OK, SO ORB US
DOWN THERE,

41:22.134 --> 41:23.411
AND WE'LL DRAG HER
HOME KICKING
AND SCREAMING.

41:23.511 --> 41:25.091
THERE IS NO WAY WE CAN
FIND THE CORONATION SITE
WITHOUT THE WIZARD.

41:25.101 --> 41:27.999
I DON'T CARE. WE CAN'T
JUST LEAVE HER THERE.

41:28.099 --> 41:30.435
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
WE'LL HAVE TO FIND
ANOTHER WAY.

41:41.489 --> 41:44.767
ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THIS?

41:44.867 --> 41:46.561
YOU'RE GIVING UP
YOUR LIFE.

41:46.661 --> 41:49.581
MY LIFE IS WITH YOU
AND OUR BABY.

41:50.332 --> 41:52.292
WE'LL BE STRONG
TOGETHER.

41:53.752 --> 41:55.529
AFTER ALL...

41:55.629 --> 41:57.630
WE'RE FAMILY.

42:10.229 --> 42:13.567
I LOVE YOU.

42:18.071 --> 42:21.408
IT IS TIME.

42:22.826 --> 42:23.243
WE'RE READY.
