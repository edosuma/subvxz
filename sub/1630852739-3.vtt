45:30.394 --> 45:32.021
GAIL: The plan?

45:32.021 --> 45:34.690
The plan is,

45:34.690 --> 45:36.234
all-out media blitz.

45:36.234 --> 45:39.654

every time I have
a kickoff meeting with someone,

45:59.423 --> 46:01.425
I like to start
by talking story.

46:01.425 --> 46:02.426
- Story?

46:02.426 --> 46:04.887
- As in, what is the story

46:04.887 --> 46:06.472
you want to tell?

46:07.765 --> 46:08.933
- I...

46:10.851 --> 46:14.605
- Every good PR campaign
has a core central narrative.

46:14.605 --> 46:17.733
- Right.
- Redemption. Resurrection.

46:17.733 --> 46:22.280
Reinvention, self-reflection,
survival...love?

46:22.280 --> 46:24.824
- [giggling]
That's a lot of stories.

46:24.824 --> 46:26.367
- When you look
at other people's careers,

46:26.367 --> 46:28.786
who do you look to?

46:28.786 --> 46:30.538
- Oh, you mean,
who do I admire?

46:30.538 --> 46:32.540
- Who are your role models?

46:32.540 --> 46:34.292
Who do you aspire
to take after?

46:34.292 --> 46:36.585
- Oh.
Yeah, that's a good question.

46:36.585 --> 46:38.838
Um, I guess I would have
to say...

46:39.922 --> 46:41.674
[sighs]
Jane Fonda.

46:44.385 --> 46:45.845
- Tell me.

46:45.845 --> 46:48.681
- Well, you know...

46:49.974 --> 46:51.892
Well, when she first
started out,

46:51.892 --> 46:53.602
she was just
this girl next door,

46:53.602 --> 46:56.689
and, um, you know, then--
then she did Barbarella,

46:56.689 --> 47:00.943
and she became
this huge sex symbol, you know?

47:00.943 --> 47:02.486
Well, and then--
and then she turned around,

47:02.486 --> 47:06.073
and she started doing
all these serious Oscar roles,

47:06.073 --> 47:08.576
you know, and then--
and also the activism.

47:08.576 --> 47:10.578
She was going to protests,
she was getting arrested,

47:10.578 --> 47:12.038
and then...

47:12.038 --> 47:13.664
and then in the '80s,
she just turns around,

47:13.664 --> 47:15.708
she just builds
this whole fitness empire.

47:15.708 --> 47:17.501
[laughs]

47:17.501 --> 47:19.462
I mean, yeah, she was
all these different things.

47:19.462 --> 47:21.881
She was all these totally
opposite things all at once.

47:21.881 --> 47:24.091
She was--she was--
she was--you know,

47:24.091 --> 47:26.218
she was protesting Vietnam
and selling workout tapes.

47:26.218 --> 47:30.181
She was being a feminist
and a sex object.

47:30.181 --> 47:32.641
People gave her
so much shit for it.

47:32.641 --> 47:34.310
"How could you do that?
You're such a hypocrite."

47:34.310 --> 47:35.686
But she didn't care.

47:35.686 --> 47:36.937
She didn't give a shit
what people thought of her.

47:36.937 --> 47:38.230
You know, that--that--

47:38.230 --> 47:40.274
that's probably the most
amazing thing about her.

47:40.274 --> 47:43.194
You know, she didn't worry
what people thought.

47:43.194 --> 47:44.779
She never tried
to please anybody.

47:44.779 --> 47:46.238
She was just like,
"You know what?

47:46.238 --> 47:49.116
"I am this badass,
sex bomb, anti-war,

47:49.116 --> 47:50.826
"workout-video-selling
actress chick,

47:50.826 --> 47:52.953
and if you got
a problem with it, fuck you."

47:54.330 --> 47:57.041
