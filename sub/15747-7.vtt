- The silver will incapacitate

05:28.762 --> 05:30.762
the Master. The lead

05:30.764 --> 05:33.298
will cut off

06:36.830 --> 06:39.698
We saw that in action

06:39.700 --> 06:42.000
- See this?

06:42.002 --> 06:44.669
This is a sampling
of all<i> strigoi</i> communication.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.205
It's... varying

06:47.207 --> 06:50.342

predictable range. Until here.

06:50.344 --> 06:53.378
- That looks like
a call to arms to me.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.180
A direct signal
from the Master, right?

06:55.182 --> 06:57.215
- A passage in the<i> Lumen</i>
refers to

06:57.217 --> 06:59.551
"the silent voice
of the Master."

06:59.553 --> 07:01.887
Interesting, yet trivial.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.022
- Not if we can
isolate it. If we can

07:04.024 --> 07:06.191
set it out from the rest
of the<i> strigoi</i> static,

07:06.193 --> 07:08.860
then we can use this technique
to track him down.

07:08.862 --> 07:11.897

of reference.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.298

07:13.300 --> 07:15.534
- The black box.
- From Regis Air

753. It might still
have his "voice"

07:18.071 --> 07:20.539
