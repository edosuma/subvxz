00:03.519 --> 00:05.954
ELIZABETH: <i>Can you imagine</i>

00:05.955 --> 00:09.992
how many meetings and discussions

00:09.993 --> 00:12.666
it took to get this thing made?

00:12.667 --> 00:14.320
Apparently, there was an argument

00:14.321 --> 00:16.455
to make the structure a log cabin.

00:16.456 --> 00:17.957
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

00:17.958 --> 00:19.725
- Pretty big cabin.
- Mm-hmm.

00:19.726 --> 00:21.861
Why won't Russell answer my text?

00:21.862 --> 00:23.362
JASON: Um, other than helping run

00:23.363 --> 00:25.431
the most powerful country
in the world?

00:25.432 --> 00:27.767
I never ask for anything,
but I need a Monday off

00:27.768 --> 00:29.335
- in two months.
- What for?

00:29.336 --> 00:32.137
Emma Feldman's wedding,
in Turks and Caicos.

00:32.139 --> 00:33.121
Ah.

00:33.122 --> 00:34.707
Can people stop with the
destination weddings?

00:34.708 --> 00:37.243
Hey, who remembers
the actual occasion for...

00:37.244 --> 00:38.511
the Gettysburg Address?

00:38.512 --> 00:40.213
Don't make it school, honey.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.581
They used to like it.

00:41.582 --> 00:43.349
Well, then they grew up.

00:43.350 --> 00:44.984
We've lived here almost four years.

00:44.985 --> 00:48.554
This is the first time
doing D.C. as a family...

00:48.555 --> 00:50.189
You thought they'd like it. Me, too.

00:50.190 --> 00:52.992
But we forgot... they have lives.

00:52.993 --> 00:54.393
They have phones. Their lives happen

00:54.394 --> 00:56.429
- on phones.
- I hate that.

00:56.430 --> 00:58.831
Oh. Go ahead,

00:58.832 --> 01:00.867
- but there's no point.
- I hate that, too.

01:00.868 --> 01:03.169
God! Why has no one
checked my blog post

01:03.170 --> 01:05.304
about the history of the poncho?

01:05.305 --> 01:06.839
It's, like, everyone
wants to be in it,

01:06.840 --> 01:08.708
but no one wants
to know where it came from.

01:08.709 --> 01:10.543
- Huh. Funny that. Okay, come on,
- (ELIZABETH LAUGHS)

01:10.544 --> 01:12.078
Vietnam Memorial. Let's go.

01:12.079 --> 01:13.212
- (GROANS)
- No, please.

01:13.213 --> 01:15.648
- One memorial and you're done?
- No,

01:15.649 --> 01:17.950
it's just, like, the wall
is gonna be so heavy.

01:17.951 --> 01:19.418
Can we, like, break it up

01:19.419 --> 01:21.420
- with something fun, maybe?
- Yeah, sure,

01:21.421 --> 01:23.489
we'll go directly
to the statue memorializing

01:23.490 --> 01:25.658
what fun it was forming a democracy.

01:25.659 --> 01:28.494
Yeah, okay, okay, we need a
break and maybe some food.

01:28.495 --> 01:29.996
I know a fun place that's nearby,

01:29.997 --> 01:32.746
and we can look at the cherry
blossoms on the way. Come on.

01:32.747 --> 01:34.429
Gift from the Japanese
government in 1912.

01:34.430 --> 01:37.168
- Stop teaching. Stop teaching.
- That's what I do.

01:38.437 --> 01:40.006
Oh!

01:40.007 --> 01:41.207
It's a little long.

01:41.208 --> 01:42.341
Really?

01:42.342 --> 01:43.576
Inches.

01:43.577 --> 01:45.211
Inches <i>inside.</i>

01:45.212 --> 01:46.846
Receiver's call.

01:46.847 --> 01:48.681
Gentlemen's game, dude. Right?

01:48.682 --> 01:50.082
Okay, Viscount.

01:50.083 --> 01:52.384
Try this.

01:54.787 --> 01:56.155
Nice.

01:56.156 --> 01:58.223
Breeze helped you out a little.

01:58.925 --> 02:01.093
- I can feel it.
- Yeah.

02:01.094 --> 02:03.462
More like the breeze of the ball
saying, "Don't bother."

02:03.463 --> 02:05.231
Yeah. Come on.

02:05.232 --> 02:07.999
Okay, Waffles, water break.

02:08.734 --> 02:10.536
Here.

02:10.537 --> 02:12.071
- Come on and drink. Oh.
- Uh...

02:12.072 --> 02:12.879
(LAUGHING)

02:12.880 --> 02:15.207
Sorry. Thor just has to
meet every dog in the park

02:15.208 --> 02:16.976
before he does his business.

02:16.977 --> 02:18.411
- Thor?
- Yeah.

02:18.412 --> 02:20.379
Oh, I'm sorry, cutie,
but you are not a Thor.

02:20.380 --> 02:22.748
Right? He was already
named when I rescued him.

02:22.749 --> 02:24.817
Oh, I-I rescued Waffles, too.

02:24.818 --> 02:26.919
Waffles? Seriously?

02:26.920 --> 02:29.622
Uh-huh. A bomb-
sniffing-school washout.

02:29.623 --> 02:31.691
Named after a fancy pancake.

02:31.692 --> 02:33.659
- Oh, are you in the Bureau?
- No, State.

02:33.660 --> 02:36.195
Is your husband in State, too?

02:36.196 --> 02:37.563
I'm not married.

02:37.564 --> 02:39.365
I'm kind of single mom'ing it.

02:39.366 --> 02:42.635
Oh. I'm Thomas. (CHUCKLES)

02:42.636 --> 02:44.836
Daisy.

02:45.504 --> 02:47.440
- Eh! Hooked it.
- Eh.

02:47.441 --> 02:49.442
Just the right amount, Mr. President.

02:49.443 --> 02:50.743
Where's Elizabeth today?

02:50.744 --> 02:53.179
She had a family conflict.

02:53.180 --> 02:55.982
Talk about a swing.

02:55.983 --> 02:59.885
She can't make the NSC game,
my wallet just says thank you.

02:59.886 --> 03:01.920
BECKER (LAUGHS): Amen to that.

03:03.522 --> 03:05.291
ELIZABETH: Yes!

03:05.292 --> 03:07.927
Incredible. Your mom has always
been really turbo about this game.

03:07.928 --> 03:10.196
- Mama needs that big...
- Whoa.

03:10.197 --> 03:11.664
What is that up there?

03:11.665 --> 03:12.965
- HENRY: Manatee?
- Manatee.

03:12.966 --> 03:14.533
Yeah! Oh!

03:14.534 --> 03:17.703
You guys should pay attention
and see how this is done.

03:17.704 --> 03:19.338
I don't need a manatee.

03:19.339 --> 03:22.575
- Is anyone getting reception in here?
- No. I'm just

03:22.576 --> 03:24.343
- deleting photos.
- It's a total dead zone.

03:24.344 --> 03:25.578
Maybe that's why

03:25.579 --> 03:27.146
I still haven't heard from Russell.

03:27.147 --> 03:28.514
Maybe the parking lot?

03:28.515 --> 03:30.850
Hey, could we all put down our robots

03:30.851 --> 03:33.085
and enjoy this family activity

03:33.086 --> 03:35.254
that we insisted on doing?

03:35.255 --> 03:37.356
- Come on!
- Okay, fine. Hand it over.

03:37.357 --> 03:39.492
- Come on, here.
- There, you can do this one.

03:39.493 --> 03:40.626
Wait, wait.

03:40.627 --> 03:42.461
- Bring it straight back. Straight back.
- Whoo!

03:42.462 --> 03:43.829
Straight back. No spin, no spin!

03:43.830 --> 03:45.097
ELIZABETH: Yeah, baby!

03:45.098 --> 03:47.166
- KAT: <i>Hey.</i>
- BLAKE: <i>Hey.</i>

03:47.167 --> 03:50.569
- What are you in for?
- Oh, self-imposed spring cleaning

03:50.570 --> 03:53.339
M-Sec's personal files. You?

03:53.340 --> 03:54.874
A big policy binder

03:54.875 --> 03:56.942
for the Bureau
of South Central Asian Affairs

03:56.943 --> 03:58.344
which isn't due for a month,

03:58.345 --> 04:00.212
but it's keeping me awake at night.

04:00.213 --> 04:01.547
Do you need some help?

04:01.548 --> 04:03.949
- I'm almost done with my pathology.
- Really?

04:03.950 --> 04:05.284
No, really.

04:05.285 --> 04:07.353
It's a 500-page dossier,

04:07.354 --> 04:10.156
and it's not exactly a potboiler.

04:10.157 --> 04:12.194
I'd like to dip my toe
in another department.

04:12.195 --> 04:13.105
Oh.

04:13.106 --> 04:14.927
I should also get a more concrete idea

04:14.928 --> 04:17.029
of what I'm supposed to do next.

04:17.029 --> 04:19.697
Well, if you still want
to do policy after this,

04:19.699 --> 04:22.034
you may have found your
calling, my friend.

04:22.035 --> 04:23.035
Great.

04:23.036 --> 04:24.303
DALTON: <i>That really was</i>

04:24.304 --> 04:27.039
- a hell of a drive, Gordon.
- Well, thank you, sir.

04:27.040 --> 04:28.541
My lucky day, I guess.

04:28.542 --> 04:29.742
Not if POTUS cuts your budget.

04:29.743 --> 04:31.744
(CHUCKLES) Thank you, Russell.

04:31.745 --> 04:34.146
Now, do I have to wonder
every time I win

04:34.147 --> 04:36.048
if it's because someone
was afraid of me?

04:36.049 --> 04:38.751
Well, you really weren't
wondering that already, sir?

04:38.752 --> 04:40.986
(PHONE PLAYING ALARM TONE)

04:40.987 --> 04:43.089
That's a soothing ring choice.

04:43.090 --> 04:44.590
It's STRATCOM.

04:44.591 --> 04:47.792
This is NSA Ellen Hill.

04:53.466 --> 04:54.667
Charlie.

04:54.668 --> 04:57.636
Delta. Three. Three. Niner. Seven.

04:57.637 --> 04:59.671
What's going on?

05:00.372 --> 05:02.475
Confidence level?

05:02.476 --> 05:05.811
Gather the NSC plus five
and kick it to CiC comms

05:05.812 --> 05:08.080
- immediately.
- What the hell is it?

05:08.081 --> 05:09.448
Early warning satellites

05:09.449 --> 05:11.250
detected multiple Russian launches.

05:11.251 --> 05:13.858
- What?!
- Salnikov can't be that crazy.

05:13.859 --> 05:15.621
He said he'd get us back after Syria.

05:15.622 --> 05:17.890
- By launching nukes?
- AGENT: Cover Falcon! Cover Falcon!

05:17.891 --> 05:20.159
CIA's psych eval of Salnikov

05:20.160 --> 05:21.660
indicated volatility and mood swings.

05:21.661 --> 05:22.728
We just killed

05:22.729 --> 05:25.397
- 300 Russians in Aleppo.
- Mr. President,

05:25.398 --> 05:27.032
I have STRATCOM.
Put them on speaker, Captain.

05:27.033 --> 05:28.134
Yes, sir.

05:28.135 --> 05:30.069
Colonel McPherson is on the line.

05:30.070 --> 05:32.138
- McPherson?
- General Bradley is off duty, sir.

05:32.139 --> 05:34.140
NSC plus five is being patched in.

05:34.141 --> 05:36.142
Colonel McPherson, what's the sitrep?

05:36.143 --> 05:37.176
Mr. President,

05:37.177 --> 05:38.344
SSPARS is now tracking

05:38.345 --> 05:40.379
more than 400 Russian ICBMs

05:40.380 --> 05:42.014
heading for U.S. mainland,

05:42.015 --> 05:44.517
striking in about 20 minutes.

05:44.518 --> 05:47.086
- Oh, my God.
- What about our monitoring stations?

05:47.087 --> 05:48.821
London and Alaska already
confirmed; Greenland on alert.

05:48.822 --> 05:49.822
Is there anything

05:49.823 --> 05:51.223
indicating otherwise?

05:51.224 --> 05:53.893
- No, sir.
- Do we have all NSC on the line?

05:53.894 --> 05:56.128
All but Secretary McCord
and DNI Ware, sir.

05:56.129 --> 05:57.329
We can't reach them.

05:57.330 --> 05:59.865
Does anyone have any reason to believe

05:59.866 --> 06:01.800
that our systems could be wrong?

06:01.801 --> 06:03.802
Admiral Forsyth here, Mr. President.

06:03.803 --> 06:06.291
It's a long shot, but we've
always worried about a hack.

06:06.292 --> 06:07.284
Not possible.

06:07.285 --> 06:10.142
The network's air gapped and continually
monitored for unauthorized code.

06:10.143 --> 06:12.011
Now is not the time to be defensive

06:12.012 --> 06:13.245
about our systems, Gordon.

06:13.246 --> 06:15.281
Colonel, is there anything indicating

06:15.282 --> 06:17.416
a possible intrusion
in the network, anything at all?

06:17.417 --> 06:18.551
No, sir. Every indication

06:18.552 --> 06:20.419
is that we are under attack,
Mr. President.

06:20.420 --> 06:22.421
Sir, I recommend initiating
Night Watch continuity

06:22.422 --> 06:24.423
of government protocol immediately.

06:24.424 --> 06:26.791
Do it. Major, open the football.

06:29.695 --> 06:32.498
ELIZABETH: <i>Three, two, one...</i>

06:32.499 --> 06:34.567
ALISON: Dad,
you're already so far behind.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.569
HENRY: Well, I...
- Put your foot on the gas!

06:36.570 --> 06:38.771
What are those...
those oil can things?

06:38.772 --> 06:41.407
You have to grab them, Dad,
so you can leave the oil slicks.

06:41.408 --> 06:43.075
- I'll crash.
- It's okay to crash.

06:43.076 --> 06:45.010
I can't crash... I'm a trained pilot.

06:45.011 --> 06:46.345
These things have consequences.

06:46.346 --> 06:47.980
It's called <i>Redline Rampage,</i>
you got to be

06:47.981 --> 06:48.981
a little bit more rampage-y...

06:48.982 --> 06:50.916
(ALL SHOUTING)

06:50.917 --> 06:52.718
(CHUCKLES) Oh...

06:52.719 --> 06:56.288
I am seriously stunned to
be beating you right now.

06:56.289 --> 06:57.957
I mean, I don't know what's happening.

06:57.958 --> 06:59.225
Well, don't get used to it.

06:59.226 --> 07:00.626
And you can stop with the...

07:00.627 --> 07:03.128
- (PHONE CHIMES)
- psych-out.

07:03.129 --> 07:06.464
MATT: That was uncalled for.

07:09.168 --> 07:11.337
Is everything okay?

07:11.338 --> 07:13.405
Uh, family emergency.

07:13.406 --> 07:15.641
- Is Chloe okay?
- Yeah.

07:15.642 --> 07:17.276
I, uh... I just have to go.

07:17.277 --> 07:18.776
Sorry.

07:19.979 --> 07:22.058
DALTON: <i>Major Attack Option Three</i>

07:22.059 --> 07:24.188
takes out all of their
military installations

07:24.189 --> 07:25.805
but limits civilian casualties.

07:25.806 --> 07:26.983
Problem with that
is we can't guarantee

07:26.984 --> 07:29.421
- it neutralizes their entire military.
- Mr. President,

07:29.422 --> 07:31.123
I strongly advise
Major Attack Option One.

07:31.124 --> 07:32.791
I concur. Anything less

07:32.792 --> 07:34.493
than the most
devastating counterstrike

07:34.494 --> 07:37.362
invites a second wave,
killing even more Americans.

07:40.299 --> 07:42.367
We need to get you
airborne, Mr. President.

07:45.471 --> 07:47.573
HILL: <i>Mr. President,</i>

07:47.574 --> 07:50.075
we're running out of time...
if you don't launch

07:50.076 --> 07:53.045
before the Russian missiles hit,
they could take out our silos,

07:53.046 --> 07:55.981
- severely limiting our response.
- We'd lose an entire leg

07:55.982 --> 07:57.616
of the nuclear triad.

07:57.617 --> 08:00.619
There has to be
a better option than just...

08:00.620 --> 08:03.088
responding in kind
to an all-out Russian attack.

08:03.089 --> 08:05.658
It'd almost certainly bring on
a nuclear winter,

08:05.659 --> 08:07.826
killing everyone on the planet.

08:07.827 --> 08:09.862
We have to think about that.

08:09.863 --> 08:12.331
HILL: Nuclear winter
is a theory, Russell.

08:12.332 --> 08:13.632
The president has to execute

08:13.633 --> 08:15.534
what we've been gaming
and planning for decades.

08:15.535 --> 08:17.249
There's only one way to fulfill your

08:17.250 --> 08:19.271
constitutional obligation, Mr.
President.

18:14.325 --> 18:15.491
As you recall, sir,

18:15.492 --> 18:18.294
STRATCOM recently upgraded
its systems; hardware,

18:18.295 --> 18:19.327
software...

18:19.328 --> 18:21.230
Are you telling me this
was some kind of glitch?

18:21.231 --> 18:22.532
No, sir.

18:22.533 --> 18:24.200
Apparently, General Bradley
wanted to run a stress test

18:24.201 --> 18:25.335
on this new equipment

18:25.336 --> 18:26.769
to see how it would
interact with personnel.

18:26.770 --> 18:29.172
- A stress test?
- So he had his CTO

18:29.173 --> 18:32.909
upload a simulation
on the backup system

18:32.910 --> 18:35.178
at the end of his shift last night

18:39.783 --> 18:42.251
I almost ended the world
because of a simulation?

18:42.252 --> 18:43.886
Bradley didn't inform staff.

18:43.887 --> 18:45.989
He wanted them to believe it was real.

18:45.990 --> 18:48.324
Planned on running it
when he got back in,

18:48.325 --> 18:50.927
but the primary system
unexpectedly failed

18:50.928 --> 18:52.662
and the backup came on seamlessly,

18:52.663 --> 18:55.131
so no one in the GOC knew.

18:55.132 --> 18:56.933
Pretty convincing simulation.

18:56.934 --> 18:58.835
I think that's the point.

18:58.836 --> 18:59.936
Fire Bradley.

18:59.937 --> 19:01.704
I've already relieved him
of duty, sir.

19:01.705 --> 19:02.905

19:02.906 --> 19:05.108

Supposed to be on computers off-site.

19:06.510 --> 19:10.380
Like many four stars,
Bradley doesn't lack confidence.

19:10.381 --> 19:11.714
He ignored the rule.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.616
And what if General Nelson
didn't have clearance issues?

19:13.617 --> 19:16.653
Would Bradley have arrived
in time to abort the launches?

19:16.654 --> 19:19.756
No, sir. It slowed the order
by almost two minutes.

19:19.757 --> 19:21.057
We were down to the wire

19:21.058 --> 19:22.659
in a few of our
launch control centers.

19:22.660 --> 19:26.329
So the world was saved
by a philandering general.

19:26.330 --> 19:28.097
Maybe his mistress should get a medal.

19:28.098 --> 19:30.299
I've ordered a review
of our alert procedures, sir,

19:30.300 --> 19:32.402
- system wide.
- Well,

19:32.403 --> 19:34.537
that ought to take care of it.

19:34.538 --> 19:35.805
We've been on this posture

19:35.806 --> 19:40.009
for over 50 years,
what else do we need to know?

19:40.010 --> 19:42.812
- What are you getting at, Bess?
- Isn't the problem

19:42.813 --> 19:45.048
the policy itself?

19:45.049 --> 19:48.885
Being on hair-trigger alert
to order the destruction

19:48.886 --> 19:50.353
- of the planet.
- HILL: Like you said,

19:50.354 --> 19:51.587
it's worked for 50 years.

19:51.588 --> 19:53.421
I didn't say it's worked.

19:54.357 --> 19:56.926
It's more like...

19:56.927 --> 19:58.161
we've been lucky.

19:58.162 --> 20:00.203
The Russians are on ready-alert, too.

20:00.204 --> 20:03.066
What choice do we have,
but to counterbalance?

20:03.067 --> 20:04.701
De-alert our silos.

20:04.702 --> 20:06.469
And how exactly

20:06.470 --> 20:07.537
would we do that?

20:07.538 --> 20:09.505
Remove the warheads from the missiles.

20:09.506 --> 20:11.207
So it'd take several hours

20:11.208 --> 20:13.142
or days to rearm. If we de-alert

20:13.143 --> 20:15.178
our ICBMs, it would put
too much pressure

20:15.179 --> 20:16.813
on the other forces
of the nuclear triad.

20:16.814 --> 20:19.882
- There's a reason a stool has three legs.
- Our subs become vulnerable.

20:19.883 --> 20:21.718
If there's a problem
with our bombers...

20:21.719 --> 20:24.970
We have 14 stealth subs,
each with more than enough

20:24.971 --> 20:28.007
warheads to destroy Russia.

20:28.008 --> 20:30.910
We have a hundred
nuclear-armed bombers.

20:30.911 --> 20:34.480
Clinging to the notion
that we need to maintain

20:34.481 --> 20:36.882
ready-alert ICBMs,

20:36.883 --> 20:39.218
that means STRATCOM has three minutes

20:39.219 --> 20:40.820
to make the call
to the crisis coordinator,

20:40.821 --> 20:42.054
who has two minutes

20:42.055 --> 20:43.856
to call the president.

20:43.857 --> 20:47.660
And then POTUS has five minutes
to make a decision.

20:47.661 --> 20:50.062
I mean, talk about vulnerability.

20:50.063 --> 20:51.731
It's insanity.

20:51.732 --> 20:53.366
After what happened today,

20:53.367 --> 20:55.868
how could we come
to any other conclusion?

20:55.869 --> 20:57.103
Maybe you should stay
in your lane, Elizabeth.

20:57.104 --> 20:58.337
Not if you're gonna blow up

20:58.338 --> 20:59.739
- the entire highway, Gordon.
- HILL: Okay, okay.

20:59.740 --> 21:02.608
Fine. Even if we got
the Russians to go along

21:02.609 --> 21:04.443
with the de-alerting,
there would be no way

21:04.444 --> 21:06.712
we could verify that they
were holding up their end.

21:06.713 --> 21:07.813
We verified START I and II.

21:07.814 --> 21:09.281
And what if there's a crisis

21:09.282 --> 21:10.716
and we have to go back on alert?

21:10.717 --> 21:13.119
A frenetic and unstable
re-alerting race

21:13.120 --> 21:16.122
could spiral into a launch.

21:16.123 --> 21:17.957
That threat could be managed.

21:17.958 --> 21:20.559
But forcing leaders
to make a snap decision

21:20.560 --> 21:23.596
about nuclear war with limited

21:23.597 --> 21:26.899
and hastily compiled
information is untenable.

21:26.900 --> 21:29.602
That's the game we're in,
and it's not gonna change.

21:29.603 --> 21:31.604
Why are you so dug in

21:31.605 --> 21:33.806
that you-you can't even see
another point of view?

21:33.807 --> 21:34.940
I'm not gonna argue.

21:34.941 --> 21:36.841
You're obviously having
an emotional reaction.

21:38.344 --> 21:41.781
Normally, I would have a
problem with a man telling me

21:41.782 --> 21:43.816
that I was emotional at work,

21:43.817 --> 21:44.984
but after what happened today,

21:44.985 --> 21:47.186
after thinking that I
was seeing my kids

21:47.187 --> 21:48.254
for the very last time,

21:48.255 --> 21:50.488
you are damn right I'm emotional.

21:51.524 --> 21:55.161
And maybe emotion is what's missing

21:55.162 --> 21:57.563
from the stupid, so-called logic

21:57.564 --> 22:01.400
behind our dehumanized
nuclear posture.

22:01.401 --> 22:04.103
You know what's even stupider?

22:04.104 --> 22:06.038
We've been here before.

22:06.039 --> 22:07.773
1979,

22:07.774 --> 22:10.141
like you alluded to,
only back then it was NORAD.

22:10.142 --> 22:11.784
They kicked it up to the NSA,

22:11.785 --> 22:13.786
who almost alerted Jimmy Carter

22:13.787 --> 22:17.723
because a simulation
was triggered between shifts.

22:17.724 --> 22:19.759
Talk about not learning a lesson.

22:19.760 --> 22:21.994
How many times today did we hear,

22:21.995 --> 22:24.797
"This can't be a mistake.
This can't be a mistake"?

22:24.798 --> 22:27.333
Meanwhile, satellites pick up

22:27.334 --> 22:29.990
a couple routine launches
practically every day,

22:29.991 --> 22:33.371
STRATCOM automatically starts
the drill in response,

22:33.372 --> 22:35.439
again and again, rinse and repeat.

22:35.440 --> 22:36.440
Bess is right.

22:36.441 --> 22:38.743
This-this is not

22:38.744 --> 22:41.278
a rational, deliberate process.

22:41.279 --> 22:45.149
It-it's the rote enactment
of a prepared script

22:45.150 --> 22:47.017
that forces leaders
to render decisions

22:47.018 --> 22:50.087
determining the fate
of the planet and mankind

22:50.088 --> 22:52.356
under excruciating pressure.

22:52.357 --> 22:55.726
If we, if we don't do
everything in our power

22:55.727 --> 23:00.931
to fix it, reduce the odds
of this happening again,

23:00.932 --> 23:04.702
then aren't we all complicit

23:04.703 --> 23:08.805
in recklessness
that borders on immorality?

23:24.889 --> 23:28.024
We'll talk again tomorrow.

23:35.213 --> 23:38.484
(GROANS) Russell hasn't
gotten back to me,

23:38.485 --> 23:39.785
and Emma is freaking out.

23:39.786 --> 23:41.821
God, she wants the whole guest list

23:41.822 --> 23:43.255
two months in advance; I mean, like,

23:43.256 --> 23:45.992
people lose their minds over weddings.

23:45.993 --> 23:47.493
ALISON: And what's with
Turks and Caicos?

23:47.494 --> 23:49.161
- Can you even afford that?
- STEVIE: No!

23:49.162 --> 23:51.030
I cannot, I can't eat out
for an entire month.

23:51.031 --> 23:52.565
It is very insensitive of her.

23:52.566 --> 23:54.533
- So blow it off.
- She's one of my best friends.

23:54.534 --> 23:55.701
I can't do that.

23:55.702 --> 23:57.169
You know, you guys,

23:57.170 --> 23:58.504
just go on, we got this.

23:58.505 --> 24:00.806
- Okay.
- Back to compulsively checking my blog.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.074
Oh, yeah,

24:02.075 --> 24:04.609
- when is your project due?
- Um, a week from Friday.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.483
I can't normalize.

24:10.484 --> 24:12.351
Me, either.

24:12.352 --> 24:14.853
How do we get our lives back?

24:16.122 --> 24:19.692
We just keep doing it, I guess.

24:19.693 --> 24:23.394
What were you thinking about,
when we were waiting?

24:24.130 --> 24:26.631
What a lucky man I am.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.370
What a blessed life I'd had.

24:31.371 --> 24:34.040
But sad, you know,

24:34.041 --> 24:36.876
for the kids, for the future
they wouldn't get to have.

24:36.877 --> 24:40.146

24:51.958 --> 24:55.294
I thought of telling Lydia,

24:55.295 --> 24:58.397
but she was washing her face,

24:58.398 --> 25:01.400
complaining about her crow's feet.

25:01.401 --> 25:05.604
I told her all I see
are those beautiful eyes,

25:05.605 --> 25:07.306
and she called me a liar.

25:07.307 --> 25:09.475
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

25:09.476 --> 25:12.344
If only she knew how beautiful
she looked tonight.

25:21.855 --> 25:25.257
We were all in that oblivion
for a little while,

25:25.258 --> 25:28.327
but now there's no going back.

25:28.328 --> 25:30.796
No, indeed.

25:30.797 --> 25:32.865
When I believed
the Russians had launched,

25:32.866 --> 25:34.900
I kept trying to understand why.

25:34.901 --> 25:36.802
I thought, if it's all going to hell,

25:36.803 --> 25:39.004
and I'm responsible for half of it,

25:39.005 --> 25:41.941
I should at least comprehend it.

25:41.942 --> 25:44.343
HENRY: And what did you come up with?

25:44.344 --> 25:46.112
Well, you're gonna laugh.

25:46.113 --> 25:47.580
And it's not the perfect analogue,

25:54.054 --> 25:55.454
Well, that sounds about right.

25:55.455 --> 25:56.722
I thought, well, we killed

25:56.723 --> 25:59.658
300 Russians in Syria last week.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.827
It must just be
President Salnikov's nature

26:01.828 --> 26:03.896
to retaliate
with everything they've got.

26:03.897 --> 26:05.097
I know it doesn't make sense,

26:05.098 --> 26:07.933
but that's what keeps
spinning in my mind.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.902
Things that don't make sense.

26:09.903 --> 26:12.571
Like what if these
missiles don't protect us

26:12.572 --> 26:16.742
nearly as much as they threaten us?

26:16.743 --> 26:18.310
We need to do everything we can

26:18.311 --> 26:21.313
to make sure
that our policies make sense,

26:21.314 --> 26:24.917
and if they don't,
we need to change them.

26:24.918 --> 26:26.919
I thought you wanted to sleep on it.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.354
I did.

Until I realized I can't sleep
without doing something.

Name it.

26:33.326 --> 26:37.062
Back channel with the Russians.

26:37.063 --> 26:42.434
I'm guessing they got a whiff
of our silo doors opening.

26:42.435 --> 26:45.504
If you can get any interest
in mutual de-alerting,

26:45.505 --> 26:48.374
maybe we push for a new treaty.

26:48.375 --> 26:51.744
I'll drink to that.

26:51.745 --> 26:53.879
Isn't it a little late to call Moscow?

at a banking conference...

26:56.483 --> 26:57.750

Same. Just cable news
continuously reporting

on the golf course,

Air Force One's mystery flight,
and high-level officials

and all of a sudden, returned.

27:18.305 --> 27:20.005
Well, everyone at
the White House is saying

27:20.006 --> 27:21.507
that it was some kind of drill, so...

27:21.508 --> 27:24.476
For nuclear evacuation... also,
I have a friend at the Pentagon

27:24.477 --> 27:25.845
- saying it wasn't a drill.
- What?

27:25.846 --> 27:28.848
Hey, you were whisked away
from the tennis courts.

27:28.849 --> 27:30.749

No, that wasn't your nanny face.

27:32.719 --> 27:35.154
Here's what I think.

27:35.155 --> 27:39.191
I think it wasn't a drill,
and Jay got whisked.

27:39.192 --> 27:42.528
Because he's on the list.

27:54.107 --> 27:55.541
Well, they tell you.

I am not on the list, so...

- Seriously. Seriously.
- Uh-oh.

I knew it.

28:17.130 --> 28:18.297
But let me, let me just tell you

28:18.298 --> 28:21.033

privilege buys you.

28:21.034 --> 28:22.368
Mm-hmm. Tell him.

to your friends and family.

brass for weeks or months,

28:34.814 --> 28:38.651

drinking ionized water.

after the radiation's
reduced to livable levels,

28:49.796 --> 28:53.599
from the rubble and ash.

I am just grateful to play
a quiet round of golf

40:55.214 --> 40:58.717
without worrying about nuclear winter.

40:58.718 --> 41:02.087
Not that it
can't happen anyway, but...

41:02.088 --> 41:04.022
at least we, uh,

41:04.023 --> 41:06.958
turned the odds
significantly in our favor.

41:06.959 --> 41:09.260
(CHUCKLES): Bess...

41:09.261 --> 41:12.597
you want to go ahead
and put him out of his bliss?

41:12.598 --> 41:15.599
Well, actually,
I'm a little rusty, but...

41:20.472 --> 41:21.406
Huh.

41:21.407 --> 41:22.507
<i>I let the president win.</i>

41:22.508 --> 41:23.875
HENRY: <i>Smart.</i>

41:23.876 --> 41:26.611
Russell I hammered.

41:26.612 --> 41:29.714
(CHUCKLES): Good for you.

41:29.715 --> 41:32.283
So, what's this return visit about?

41:32.284 --> 41:35.920
Sort of a... full-circle celebration?

41:35.921 --> 41:38.757
Sorta. It just...

41:38.758 --> 41:41.258
felt appropriate.

41:42.894 --> 41:46.030
This whole ordeal has reminded me

41:46.031 --> 41:49.867
about the importance of civic duty.

41:50.869 --> 41:55.473
It's reaffirmed my faith
in the process, you know?

41:55.474 --> 41:57.441
I do.

42:00.145 --> 42:02.380
We got this enormous
thing done, Henry,

42:02.381 --> 42:04.616
and I feel a responsibility

42:04.617 --> 42:07.652
to make sure it doesn't get undone.

42:07.653 --> 42:10.320
When the time comes...

42:11.689 --> 42:14.292
...I want to run for president.

42:14.293 --> 42:16.361
I know.

42:16.362 --> 42:18.395
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

42:19.130 --> 42:22.232
Wow. I really didn't.

42:24.369 --> 42:27.939
But that's nothing new.

42:27.940 --> 42:31.276
There's one other thing I know.

42:31.277 --> 42:33.277
I'm with you.
