WEBVTT

00:01.310 --> 00:03.679
Tara Messer,
will you marry me?

00:03.680 --> 00:05.879
Yes, Louis, I'll marry you.

00:05.880 --> 00:07.679
I don't care
how much money you make

00:07.680 --> 00:09.540
or how many you women
you sleep with.

00:09.550 --> 00:11.449
You have issues in your life

00:11.450 --> 00:13.680
that are going to keep you
from having real relationships.

00:13.690 --> 00:16.229
Benjamin and I have an overlap
on our software

00:16.230 --> 00:17.880
with another company.

00:17.890 --> 00:22.190
Louis pulled out every trick
in the book to get us this.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.465
- Take the money.
- I don't want the money.

00:24.466 --> 00:26.329
- Donna--
- I want something more.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.690
- What do you mean more?
<i>- I made a deal</i>

00:27.700 --> 00:29.499
that we would handle
the miners' case

00:29.500 --> 00:31.330
in exchange for the chance
to be admitted to the bar.

00:31.340 --> 00:33.139
Are you goddamn kidding me?
You're fired.

00:33.140 --> 00:35.139
- Don't do it.
- He lied--not once, not twice--

00:35.140 --> 00:37.570
I don't care
because we need him.

00:37.580 --> 00:39.419
Monday morning, you better
start putting your money

00:39.420 --> 00:41.610
where your mouth is and find us
another $50,000 case.

00:41.620 --> 00:43.679
Tara left
a 15-second voicemail.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.710
She's either gonna tell me that
she never wants to see me again

00:45.720 --> 00:48.319
or she wants to make up.

00:50.490 --> 00:52.489
What's that?

00:52.490 --> 00:54.189
Your first year's salary
in advance.

00:54.190 --> 00:55.920
Welcome back.
Harvey, I'm running out

00:55.930 --> 00:57.729
of ways to tell you I don't want
to be a corporate lawyer.

00:57.730 --> 01:00.629
I'm offering you a deal.
One for you, one for me.

01:00.630 --> 01:02.360
I don't wanna just fund
the clinic for a year.

01:02.370 --> 01:03.709
I want to fund it for two,
and any case I want

01:03.710 --> 01:05.700
to bring the clinic onto, I can.
Done.

01:05.710 --> 01:07.939
- And there's one more thing.
- You are not getting my office.

01:07.940 --> 01:09.739
Oh, yes, I am,
and I will tell you why.

01:09.740 --> 01:11.640
- Why?
- 'Cause she's gone, Harvey.

01:11.650 --> 01:14.520
It's time for you
to take the reins.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.480 --> 01:53.449
Harvey.
What are you doing here?

01:53.450 --> 01:55.480
Nothing, I was just
driving this baby around

01:55.490 --> 01:57.389
and remembered
how much street parking you had.

01:57.390 --> 01:59.389
Is that supposed
to impress me?

01:59.390 --> 02:02.759
Well, I hope so.
Sure as hell impresses me.

02:02.760 --> 02:05.290
Well, it's nice to see you,
but if you wanted

02:05.300 --> 02:06.669
an appointment,
you should have called.

02:06.670 --> 02:07.969
I'm not here
for an appointment.

02:07.970 --> 02:10.739
I'm here to ask you out.

02:10.740 --> 02:12.539
You're serious.

02:12.540 --> 02:14.239
I've been doing a lot
of thinking lately, and...

02:14.240 --> 02:15.770
- Harvey...
- Please, let me finish.

02:15.780 --> 02:17.579
Things have changed
since the last time I saw you.

02:17.580 --> 02:19.249
I'm not the same man that I was.

02:19.250 --> 02:20.779
I made peace with my family;

02:20.780 --> 02:22.540
I got my old associate back,

02:22.550 --> 02:24.619
and as of this morning,
I'm the head of my firm,

02:24.620 --> 02:28.619
and when I thought
of sharing that with someone,

02:28.620 --> 02:29.719
I thought of you.

02:29.720 --> 02:32.450
Well, it doesn't matter,

02:32.460 --> 02:34.595
because it's completely
unethical for a doctor

02:34.596 --> 02:36.490
to engage in a relationship
with her patient.

02:36.500 --> 02:39.335
Not if enough time has passed,
and according to the APA,

02:39.336 --> 02:41.760
as of three weeks ago,
enough time has passed.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.639
- You did your homework.
- Sure did.

02:43.640 --> 02:45.039
So the only question is:

02:45.040 --> 02:46.810
Thursday at 8:00
or Saturday at 9:00?

02:49.540 --> 02:51.640
One dinner,
and if this chemistry you

02:51.650 --> 02:53.379
so clearly think exists doesn't,

02:53.380 --> 02:55.679
then we part as friends,
no hard feelings.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.340
If it doesn't work out,

02:57.350 --> 02:59.410
no harm, no foul.

03:00.820 --> 03:04.759
Thursday.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.489
Oh, and if the car's too much,

03:07.490 --> 03:09.590
I can always have Ray drive.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.435
I like the car.

03:12.436 --> 03:14.460
What did you say?
I couldn't hear you.

03:14.470 --> 03:16.499
I like the car.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.549
Good.
You're here early.

03:33.550 --> 03:35.750
I need you to take point
on a consumer fraud hearing

03:35.760 --> 03:38.829
for Sandra.
Nathan, I need to talk to you.

03:38.830 --> 03:40.689
Okay.

03:40.690 --> 03:42.559
I know things got heated
between us the other night,

03:42.560 --> 03:45.390
but as far as I'm concerned,
it's water under the bridge,

03:45.400 --> 03:46.639
so if you're wondering
if I'm still upset at you--

03:46.640 --> 03:48.460
I'm not.

03:48.470 --> 03:51.539
And this is to make sure
you're still not upset with me

03:51.540 --> 03:54.610
after you hear
what I'm about to say.

03:59.550 --> 04:02.085
Why am I holding a check
for $500,000?

04:02.086 --> 04:04.810
Because I've decided to go
back to Pearson Specter Litt,

04:04.820 --> 04:07.419
and I gave you my word that I
wouldn't leave you high and dry.

04:07.420 --> 04:10.350
So let me get this straight:
You changed your mind,

04:10.360 --> 04:12.359
and now Harvey Specter
is buying you back?

04:12.360 --> 04:14.429
If it were up to Harvey,
you wouldn't be getting a penny.

04:14.430 --> 04:16.899
I insisted on this.

04:16.899 --> 04:19.428
Just like I insisted
on every other case I take

04:19.430 --> 04:21.730
from now on being pro Bono.
It sounds like you insisted

04:21.740 --> 04:22.869
on that
to make yourself feel better.

04:22.870 --> 04:24.599
No, Nathan, I did that

04:24.600 --> 04:28.370
because I care about
doing this kind of work,

04:28.380 --> 04:31.479
and if you're okay with it,
I'd even like the idea

04:31.480 --> 04:33.119
of us partnering
on a case every now and then.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.479
But what if I say I'm not okay
with any of this?

04:35.480 --> 04:37.710
I know that you were the one
that gave me another chance

04:37.720 --> 04:39.555
to be a lawyer
when no one else would,

04:39.556 --> 04:41.410
but don't punish the clinic.

04:41.420 --> 04:43.780
It's a lot of money.
With that, you could replace me

04:43.790 --> 04:47.589
and help a lot of people
for a long time.

04:54.470 --> 04:56.669
- Is that for me?
- No, actually, it's for me.

04:56.670 --> 04:58.669
You're later than usually
this morning.

04:58.670 --> 05:00.769
I've been waiting for you.
Donna, about the other night.

05:00.770 --> 05:03.500
I know you said you wanted more,
but before you say anything--

05:03.510 --> 05:05.770
- I want to be a partner.
- Partner?

05:05.780 --> 05:07.449
Yes.
I figured out what I want,

05:07.450 --> 05:08.789
and I want to be a partner
at this firm.

05:08.790 --> 05:10.579
Donna, I don't mean
to insult you,

05:10.580 --> 05:12.410
but you're not even a lawyer.

05:12.420 --> 05:14.619
Good, because my being
a partner isn't about the law.

05:14.620 --> 05:16.419
It's about keeping
this firm running,

05:16.420 --> 05:18.180
which I've been doing
for as long as I can remember.

05:18.190 --> 05:20.889
I know that, but it doesn't
mean that I can get you--

05:20.890 --> 05:23.759
I've given over ten years of
my life to this place, Harvey,

05:23.760 --> 05:26.890
and I've done it all
from your desk.

05:26.900 --> 05:30.760
All I'm asking is
for a seat at the table.

05:30.770 --> 05:32.200
I'll have to ask Louis
about it.

05:32.210 --> 05:33.875
Does that mean that
you're on board?

05:33.876 --> 05:35.839
I don't know.
It's Mike's first day back,

05:35.840 --> 05:37.870
it's a big ask,
and on top of all of that,

05:37.880 --> 05:39.779
I've decided to tell Louis

05:39.780 --> 05:41.679
that I'm taking full control
as managing partner.

05:41.680 --> 05:44.179
Well, congratulations, Harvey,
but which is it?

05:44.180 --> 05:45.910
Louis?
Mike?

05:45.920 --> 05:47.789
"Big ask."
Because I'd hate to think

05:47.790 --> 05:49.759
I mustered the courage
to do this,

05:49.760 --> 05:51.889
and then once you get on that
elevator, it's out of your mind.

05:51.890 --> 05:55.520
I give you my word.
I will not forget about it.

05:55.530 --> 05:57.799
Okay.

06:42.587 --> 06:44.209
Did you sleep in here?

06:44.210 --> 06:46.540
Just getting a feel
for my new office.

06:46.550 --> 06:48.219
You think a bike rack
would fit on this wall?

06:48.220 --> 06:50.810
You put a bike rack in here,
your first pro Bono,

06:50.820 --> 06:53.555
you'll be representing yourself
after I shove it up your ass.

06:53.556 --> 06:55.819
Wow.
That sounds uncomfortable.

06:55.820 --> 06:57.819
Now, speaking of pro bonos,

06:57.820 --> 07:00.250
when are you gonna get your
old man records out of here

07:00.260 --> 07:02.150
so I can settle in
and get to work?

07:02.160 --> 07:04.620
I'll get out of here
once we take of Neil Stillman.

07:04.630 --> 07:06.190
Neil Stillman?
Detour industries?

07:06.200 --> 07:09.239
No, Neil Stillman,
Jedi counsel.

07:09.240 --> 07:11.239
Okay, I was asking because

07:11.240 --> 07:13.939
Neil Stillman is
a corporate client,

07:13.940 --> 07:17.239
so what happened to one for me,
then one for you?

07:17.240 --> 07:19.670
Do I need to remind you that
at a corporate law firm,

07:19.680 --> 07:21.749
we do the cases
that pay the bills first?

07:21.750 --> 07:23.919
Besides, I haven't even told you
the best part yet.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.649
You only got
two weeks to live?

07:25.650 --> 07:26.849
No.
After we're done with this case,

07:26.850 --> 07:28.780
I'm giving you Neil Stillman.

07:28.790 --> 07:30.719
Harvey, I appreciate that,
but seriously,

07:30.720 --> 07:32.289
if you're just gonna give him
to me when we're done,

07:32.290 --> 07:33.889
why don't you give him
to me now?

07:33.890 --> 07:35.859
Whatever it is,
I can handle it myself.

07:35.860 --> 07:37.859
- I know that.
- Then what's going on?

07:37.860 --> 07:39.960
It doesn't make sense for us
to be working together on this.

07:39.970 --> 07:41.739
All right, you want the truth?

07:41.740 --> 07:44.260
When Jessica
made managing partner,

07:44.270 --> 07:47.730
she and I never really got
to do cases together anymore.

07:47.740 --> 07:49.300
You used to work
on cases together?

07:49.310 --> 07:50.749
Yeah.
She was me and I was you.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.770
We kicked ass.
Right.

07:52.780 --> 07:54.779
And what exactly did
you contribute to the equation?

07:54.780 --> 07:58.640
Oh, movie quotes, mostly,
but that's not the point.

07:58.650 --> 08:00.949
The point is we had
a great time doing it.

08:00.950 --> 08:02.750
- Harvey...
- Mike, I'm serious.

08:02.760 --> 08:05.859
Once Jessica stepped up,
our relationship changed.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.729
And if you'd known
that was gonna happen,

08:08.730 --> 08:10.169
you would have wanted one
last case together.

08:10.170 --> 08:13.629
Exactly.
So what do you say?

08:13.630 --> 08:15.330
We go out and have some fun
and kick some ass?

08:15.340 --> 08:17.909
Or do you want to stay here
measuring for your bike rack?

08:17.910 --> 08:20.600
It's not gonna measure itself.

08:20.610 --> 08:23.779
All right, fine.
Kick ass.

08:23.780 --> 08:26.719
But we do this,
I want on that Jedi counsel.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.379
Robes, light saber,
whole deal.

08:33.650 --> 08:34.909
Good, you're here.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.750
Gretchen,
what are you doing here?

08:36.760 --> 08:38.328
- I'm here to give you these.
- What are those?

08:38.330 --> 08:40.620
Brochures from the top
nine mud resorts

08:40.630 --> 08:42.259
in the northern hemisphere,
though I don't know

08:42.260 --> 08:43.919
why a person would do
that in the first place.

08:43.929 --> 08:47.329
It's like sitting in a bathtub
of your own poop.

08:47.330 --> 08:49.030
What the hell
are you talking about?

08:49.040 --> 08:50.809
Louis, you need
to take yourself some time off.

08:50.810 --> 08:52.900
When's the last time
you even had a vacation?

08:52.910 --> 08:54.739
Nine years ago July.

08:54.740 --> 08:56.270
Goddamn travel agent sold me
a package

08:56.280 --> 08:58.679
to Club Med Bangladesh,
so, hard pass.

08:58.680 --> 09:01.719
What kind of person goes
to a sex club in Bangladesh?

09:01.720 --> 09:03.240
It's not like that.

09:03.250 --> 09:04.789
I had just seen
"Slumdog Millionaire,"

09:04.790 --> 09:06.710
and I was trying
to find Freida Pinto.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.419
I believe she considers London
her place of habitat.

09:08.420 --> 09:09.880
No, I'm not talking about
the real Freida Pinto.

09:09.890 --> 09:11.819
I'm talking about
my Freida Pinto.

09:11.820 --> 09:13.389
There's many different
Freida Pintos out there, okay?

09:13.390 --> 09:15.959
So just--I'm not an idiot.
Leave me alone.

09:15.960 --> 09:19.060
Louis, I'm just worried that
if you sit around and stew,

09:19.070 --> 09:20.999
this breakup's gonna
get the best of you.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.660
Gretchen, I really
appreciate that,

09:22.670 --> 09:23.939
but I'm not just
gonna sit around.

09:23.940 --> 09:25.039
I'm gonna be pouring
my heartbreak

09:25.040 --> 09:26.439
into those new associates.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.979
Are you sure that's
the best idea?

09:28.980 --> 09:31.439
Look...

09:31.440 --> 09:34.040
I didn't just lose Tara.

09:34.050 --> 09:36.679
I lost a chance
at being a father.

09:36.680 --> 09:40.280
And those associates have
always been my children to me.

09:40.290 --> 09:41.949
My children.

09:41.950 --> 09:43.750
And the truth is,
I've been neglecting them

09:43.760 --> 09:45.429
ever since they got here,

09:45.430 --> 09:49.329
but that ends this morning.

09:49.330 --> 09:52.729
I'm proud of you, Louis.

09:52.730 --> 09:54.860
Thank you, Gretchen.

09:59.810 --> 10:03.079
- Where the hell have you been?
- Neil, you called an hour ago.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.049
Well, that means you should
have been here in 30 minutes.

10:05.050 --> 10:07.109
Well, I got news for you:
I'm not Dominos.

10:07.110 --> 10:09.010
That's too bad,
because slinging pizzas

10:09.020 --> 10:10.419
might be the only job
you can get

10:10.420 --> 10:11.919
if you don't stop
shitting the bed.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.819
Shitting the bed?
How's that?

10:13.820 --> 10:15.750
I've been trying to get you
on the phone for two weeks.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.330
Jessica leaves, and all of
a sudden, I start falling

10:17.320 --> 10:18.820
through the cracks?
You're not falling

10:18.830 --> 10:20.729
through anything.
I'm here now,

10:20.730 --> 10:22.429
and I brought the best
junior partner in the firm.

10:22.430 --> 10:24.399
I don't give a shit if he's
the best junior towel boy.

10:24.400 --> 10:27.069
I got something for you to do,
and I want it done yesterday.

10:27.070 --> 10:30.339
Let me guess, you want to sell
your vodka business.

10:30.340 --> 10:32.139
How the hell could
you know that?

10:32.140 --> 10:34.139
Because you don't clean up
the balance sheet

10:34.140 --> 10:36.300
of your third largest division
six months after you restructure

10:36.310 --> 10:37.879
if you're not looking
to put it on the market.

10:37.880 --> 10:40.409
Okay, you brought
the right guy.

10:40.410 --> 10:42.340
My question is,
what took so long?

10:42.350 --> 10:44.049
And my question is
what's the rush?

10:44.050 --> 10:46.149
'Cause you also don't ram
a transaction through

10:46.150 --> 10:47.910
if you don't have to.
I have an opportunity

10:47.920 --> 10:49.319
to buy another company,
and I don't wanna

10:49.320 --> 10:51.019
let it slip away.
What company?

10:51.020 --> 10:53.020
I'll start vetting them for you.
They're Russian,

10:53.030 --> 10:54.329
and they make
a little product called

10:54.330 --> 10:56.099
none of your goddamn business.

10:56.100 --> 10:58.359
Neil, what's with the secrecy?
We're your lawyers.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.060
We need to know
what you're looking to do.

11:00.070 --> 11:01.969
The secrecy is
in case you're not my lawyers

11:01.970 --> 11:03.469
two weeks from now.

11:03.470 --> 11:05.009
I don't want you knowing
who I'm going after.

11:05.010 --> 11:06.330
Is that a threat?

11:06.340 --> 11:07.939
It's just my way
of making sure

11:07.940 --> 11:09.339
I don't keep falling
through the cracks.

11:09.340 --> 11:11.940
Now let's talk terms.

11:19.820 --> 11:23.189
Good morning, Gretchen.
Have you seen Louis?

11:23.190 --> 11:25.829
I'm worried about
how he's doing after last night.

11:25.830 --> 11:27.929
My guess is he's in
the bullpen

11:27.930 --> 11:30.029
with his hatchlings.
His hatchlings?

11:30.030 --> 11:32.029
I was concerned about him
as you were,

11:32.030 --> 11:34.129
so I tried
to get him to take a vacation.

11:34.130 --> 11:37.399
He said he'd rather focus
on raising those associates.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.530
Focus on them or take it
out on them?

11:39.540 --> 11:41.939
Knowing him, probably 50/50,

11:41.940 --> 11:43.570
but the man turned down a trip

11:43.580 --> 11:45.509
to the finest mud resorts
in the world,

11:45.510 --> 11:50.140
so I decided to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

11:50.150 --> 11:51.590
Then I will too.

11:57.090 --> 11:59.859
Good morning, boys and girls.

11:59.860 --> 12:03.577
Who's ready to tear
Watson Industries a new asshole?

12:03.960 --> 12:06.529
That's what I like to see.
Now, on your desks,

12:06.530 --> 12:09.399
I've made each of you a copy
of my initial brief.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.199
Cling to it
as if you wrote it yourself,

12:11.200 --> 12:13.130
and if any of you need
to go to the bathroom,

12:13.140 --> 12:16.009
I suggest you do it now,
because for the next two weeks,

12:16.010 --> 12:17.879
we are not leaving this room.

12:17.880 --> 12:21.079
No one will be shitting.
No one will be pissing.

12:21.080 --> 12:23.540
No--
Go ahead, ask him.

12:23.550 --> 12:27.849
Ask me what?

12:27.850 --> 12:30.250
I heard about
your reputation, but...

12:30.260 --> 12:32.019
But what?

12:32.020 --> 12:33.850
Don't you worry about
my reputation, son.

12:33.860 --> 12:35.489
I am not the same Louis
I used to be.

12:35.490 --> 12:37.420
I still may be tough,
but I have a soft spot,

12:37.430 --> 12:39.090
so what do you need?

12:39.100 --> 12:42.199
Two days off.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.930
No problem.

12:43.940 --> 12:45.209
Feel free to take
Saturday and Sunday off.

12:45.210 --> 12:48.030
He meant in addition
to the weekend.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.939
In addition?
Brian, is this true?

12:49.940 --> 12:52.570
- Yes.
- Then...

12:52.580 --> 12:54.879
Monday and Sunday
you shall have.

12:57.020 --> 12:59.455
Okay, fine.
Monday and Tuesday it is.

12:59.456 --> 13:02.080
- Thank you, Mr. Litt.
- No, no, just call me Louis.

13:02.090 --> 13:03.489
Mind if I ask
what the occasion is?

13:03.490 --> 13:07.189
- I'm gonna be a father.
- What?

13:07.190 --> 13:09.220
We're gonna have a baby boy.

13:09.230 --> 13:12.199
Something everybody here knows
is never gonna happen to you.

13:17.270 --> 13:19.009
Gonna be a father

13:19.010 --> 13:22.180
for the rest of his life.

13:28.050 --> 13:31.019
- What'd you just say to me?
- I said it's a C-section,

13:31.020 --> 13:32.489
'cause the baby's
actually sideways,

13:32.490 --> 13:34.019
which means we have
to go in there...

13:34.020 --> 13:35.650
You self-centered
piece of shit.

13:35.660 --> 13:38.159
Do you think I care
about the graphic details?

13:38.160 --> 13:40.029
- I just thought--
- Thought what?

13:40.030 --> 13:42.095
That you don't give a shit
about your job?

13:42.096 --> 13:45.220
Let me tell you something: When
you work here, you work here.

13:45.230 --> 13:48.590
You don't think about home
and families and babies.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.660
So the next time you want
to put your personal life

13:50.670 --> 13:52.530
ahead of the needs of this firm,

13:52.540 --> 13:54.109
you better goddamn come to me

13:54.110 --> 13:56.179
a year in advance.
That's not fair.

13:56.180 --> 13:57.650
He couldn't have known he was
gonna have a baby a year--

13:57.640 --> 13:59.140
Let me tell you something,
Stephanie:

13:59.150 --> 14:01.149
Maybe you don't know
how babies are made,

14:01.150 --> 14:03.049
because when people are trying,
they know they're trying,

14:03.050 --> 14:04.649
and just because no one
ever wants to try with you

14:04.650 --> 14:06.210
doesn't give you the right

14:06.220 --> 14:08.359
to tell me
how to run my associates.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.980
You got that?

14:10.990 --> 14:13.520
Got it.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.860
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

14:23.870 --> 14:25.469
Depends.
What are you thinking?

14:25.470 --> 14:27.230
I'm thinking we've got
a vodka company to sell.

14:27.240 --> 14:28.900
You already said you wanted
to have some fun.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.249
That's right,
and you put those two together,

14:30.250 --> 14:31.870
what have we got?

14:31.880 --> 14:33.309
Party.
See?

14:33.310 --> 14:34.840
We're already on the same page.

14:34.850 --> 14:36.519
Why don't you get
a kick-ass location,

14:36.520 --> 14:38.349
and I'll get the models.
Models?

14:38.350 --> 14:40.549
I like models.
Why can't I get the models?

14:40.550 --> 14:42.519
You make a good point.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.419
It's a two-man job.
We'll both get the models.

14:44.420 --> 14:45.920
Harvey, seriously,
why do we even have

14:45.930 --> 14:47.499
to have models at this party?

14:47.500 --> 14:51.359
Well, two reasons.
First, people expect it,

14:51.360 --> 14:52.960
and you've got to give the
people what they want.

14:52.970 --> 14:54.829
Right, and second,

14:54.830 --> 14:56.860
any dipshit who shows up
and hits on the models all night

14:56.870 --> 14:58.869
isn't a serious bidder
for the company.

14:58.870 --> 15:01.570
Huh, you really are ready
for my office.

15:01.580 --> 15:03.479
Hey, speaking of which, when
exactly is that gonna happen.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.315
I can't talk about that
right now.

15:05.316 --> 15:07.909
I got to go hit on some models.
Hey, Harvey,

15:07.910 --> 15:09.910
jokes aside,
what you said before

15:09.920 --> 15:12.389
about us working together
like the old days,

15:12.390 --> 15:14.449
I appreciate it.

15:14.450 --> 15:16.319
It means a lot to me.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.420
Me too.

15:18.430 --> 15:19.929
Pussy.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.299
Donna, do you have a minute?
I need your help.

15:30.300 --> 15:34.230
Of course.
What's going on?

15:34.240 --> 15:35.800
Louis is out of control.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.509
When Esther got married
out of control,

15:37.510 --> 15:40.370
or when Harvey made senior
partner out of control?

15:40.380 --> 15:41.540
Worse.

15:41.550 --> 15:43.919
Shit.
What did he do?

15:43.920 --> 15:45.559
He just went off
on the associates.

15:45.560 --> 15:48.650
He was abusive
and cruel and ugly.

15:48.660 --> 15:50.959
Donna, I have never seen Louis
like this before.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.399
Rachel,
if what you're saying is true,

15:52.400 --> 15:54.250
then we need to figure out why,

15:54.260 --> 15:55.820
because with Louis,
there's always a reason--

15:55.830 --> 15:58.399
Tara broke up with him
last night.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.369
- Oh, my god.
- I was there when it happened.

16:01.370 --> 16:05.439
This is not something that
he's going to get over quickly.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.439
- So what are you saying?
- I'm saying that

16:07.440 --> 16:09.339
I think I should
take over the associates

16:09.340 --> 16:12.309
until he's able to get
his emotions under control.

16:12.310 --> 16:13.570
Rachel,
taking the associates away

16:13.580 --> 16:15.340
isn't exactly
gonna stabilize him.

16:15.350 --> 16:16.649
That's the one thing he has.

16:16.650 --> 16:18.649
Yeah, I know that,
but I'm telling you,

16:18.650 --> 16:22.050
if we're not careful, someone's
gonna do something to him,

16:22.060 --> 16:24.489
and he'll be lucky
if it's just suing him.

16:24.490 --> 16:25.989
Did you tell him that?

16:25.990 --> 16:28.020
I tried to,
and he bit my head off

16:28.030 --> 16:31.969
the minute I walked
into his office, so...

16:31.970 --> 16:35.369
Okay, I'll talk to him.

16:35.370 --> 16:38.939
But I'm gonna need you to tell
me exactly what he did first.

16:45.950 --> 16:47.619
Whatever it is,
I don't have time, Donna.

16:47.620 --> 16:49.079
From what I heard,
you had time

16:49.080 --> 16:50.510
to go off on the associates
this morning.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.349
Who told you that?
That's bullshit.

16:52.350 --> 16:53.910
Are you telling me you didn't
go off on Brian Altman

16:53.920 --> 16:55.350
and then make a horrible comment

16:55.360 --> 16:57.319
about Stephanie Patel's
sex life?

16:57.320 --> 16:59.350
- It's called discipline, Donna.
- It's called actionable, Louis.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.359
You're lucky that there isn't a
lawsuit on your desk right now.

17:01.360 --> 17:02.920
Well, thank you
for your counsel.

17:02.930 --> 17:04.729
I know what I'm doing.
Louis, I am trying

17:04.730 --> 17:06.990
to be understanding,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.598
but I think Rachel should handle
the associates for right now.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.430
- Is that a joke?
- No, it's not.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.108
Well, then let me explain

17:13.109 --> 17:15.949
a little something
to you called pecking order.

17:15.950 --> 17:19.040
See, I am up here.
Rachel's down here.

17:19.050 --> 17:21.378
And you don't give dominion
over your associates

17:21.380 --> 17:23.079
to someone down here.
I know that,

17:23.079 --> 17:24.640
but I also know that Tara
broke up with you last night,

17:24.650 --> 17:26.109
and you're not
in your right mind.

17:26.119 --> 17:27.919
I don't want to hear
that name again.

17:27.920 --> 17:29.519
Louis, all I'm saying is
if you don't deal with it,

17:29.520 --> 17:31.519
you're gonna keep abusing
the associates,

17:31.520 --> 17:33.350
and then we're gonna have--
Hey, Donna, you know what,

17:33.360 --> 17:34.650
I didn't want to do this,
but I did leave one name

17:34.660 --> 17:35.759
off the chart.

17:35.760 --> 17:38.059
Me.
Rachel.

17:38.060 --> 17:39.390
You.

17:39.400 --> 17:42.599
So don't you tell me what to do.

17:45.440 --> 17:49.145
Louis, I'm gonna let that go,
because I know you're hurting,

17:49.146 --> 17:51.400
but that right there
is exactly why I'm right,

17:51.410 --> 17:54.709
because if you're willing
to talk to me like that,

17:54.710 --> 17:56.480
god help those associates.

18:12.100 --> 18:14.569
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Yes, is this Dr. Feelgood?

18:14.570 --> 18:16.710
'Cause I'd like to schedule an
appointment as soon as possible.

18:16.700 --> 18:18.160
<i>I'm sorry.
You've got the wrong number.</i>

18:18.170 --> 18:20.169
This is Dr. I have work to do.

18:20.170 --> 18:22.570
Well, in that case, I'd like
to schedule an appointment

18:22.580 --> 18:25.579
as soon as possible.

18:25.580 --> 18:27.149
Harvey, why exactly
are you calling me?

18:27.150 --> 18:29.579
First, answer me this:
How many times

18:29.580 --> 18:30.979
have you considered
picking up the phone

18:30.980 --> 18:32.580
and telling me
that you've reconsidered

18:32.590 --> 18:34.455
since you said yes?
Four.

18:34.456 --> 18:36.119
If you don't count right now.

18:36.120 --> 18:37.680
<i>Then let's just say
I'm calling to tell you</i>

18:37.690 --> 18:39.750
that I've been
in a room full of models

18:39.760 --> 18:43.099
for the last hour,
and all I can think of is you.

18:43.100 --> 18:46.099
<i>Still thinking
of cancelling on me?</i>

18:46.100 --> 18:49.169
No, Harvey.

18:49.170 --> 18:52.109
I'm looking forward
to our dinner as well.

19:04.450 --> 19:05.749
Did you move up the date
of our wedding

19:05.750 --> 19:07.610
and forget to tell me?

19:07.620 --> 19:09.680
No, I got to get dressed up
for this thing

19:09.690 --> 19:11.589
that Harvey and I are going to
for a client.

19:11.590 --> 19:14.620
A thing for a client.

19:14.630 --> 19:16.629
That's not very specific.

19:16.630 --> 19:18.869
Uh, yeah, I mean, it's just
kind of hard to explain.

19:18.870 --> 19:20.639
Hmm, does it involve
three dozen models

19:20.640 --> 19:22.800
and 1,000 bottles of vodka?

19:27.670 --> 19:29.500
I guess it's not that
hard to explain.

19:29.510 --> 19:31.079
Mm-hmm.
When were you gonna tell me?

19:31.080 --> 19:34.849
If not before,
then definitely after...

19:34.850 --> 19:36.879
Or never.
It's hard to tell.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.740
I haven't really
thought this through.

19:38.750 --> 19:42.550
- You know I'm kidding, right?
- Yes.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.589
You should come.
I can't.

19:44.590 --> 19:47.050
Katrina and I are taking
the Chippendales public,

19:47.060 --> 19:48.820
so we're gonna meet
with a few of their top dancers

19:48.830 --> 19:51.069
to go over some paperwork.
Probably take all night.

19:51.070 --> 19:53.790
- So that's not funny.
- Yes, it is.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.530
I'm serious, Rachel,
you should come.

19:55.540 --> 19:57.209
I think Harvey got a helicopter.

19:57.210 --> 20:01.200
We should take a ride
around the city.

20:01.210 --> 20:03.209
I can't.
You go.

20:03.210 --> 20:06.679
It's a long story.
I ju--

20:06.680 --> 20:08.779
I might be taking over
the associates,

20:08.780 --> 20:11.210
and if I do,
I just want to be prepared.

20:11.220 --> 20:13.255
Rachel, that's amazing,
but are you telling me

20:13.256 --> 20:15.149
that Louis is really ready
to give that up?

20:15.150 --> 20:17.250
That's the long story.

20:17.260 --> 20:20.289
But I'll tell you
about it later tonight.

20:20.290 --> 20:21.820
- I can stay.
- No, you should go--

20:21.830 --> 20:25.699
Great, okay.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.599
I love you.
I love you too.

20:35.710 --> 20:37.849
Donna, before you leave,
can I talk to you for a second?

20:37.850 --> 20:39.570
What is it now?
We're running low

20:39.580 --> 20:41.879
on coffee filters?
Can't find the sweet 'n low?

20:41.880 --> 20:44.240
Or is Louis finally being sued
for being an asshole?

20:44.250 --> 20:45.849
You want to tell me
what's going on,

20:45.850 --> 20:47.549
or you want to keep
firing your pistol

20:47.550 --> 20:49.150
in the wrong direction?

20:49.160 --> 20:52.159
I'm sorry, Gretchen.

20:52.160 --> 20:54.895
I am just sick and tired
of being everyone's go-to

20:54.896 --> 20:56.590
and not getting what I ask for.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.329
I don't mean
to sound insensitive,

20:58.330 --> 21:00.260
but you're
a corporate secretary.

21:00.270 --> 21:03.269
What exactly did you expect?

21:03.270 --> 21:05.980
You really want to know?

21:07.870 --> 21:09.939
I asked Harvey
for a seat at the table.

21:09.940 --> 21:12.309
- What table?
- The partnership table.

21:12.310 --> 21:14.870
- No wonder he shot you down.
- He didn't shoot me down.

21:14.880 --> 21:16.810
He told me he would think
about it,

21:16.820 --> 21:18.689
but I haven't heard anything,
and I don't know now if I will.

21:18.690 --> 21:20.619
One way to get his attention
is to go in there

21:20.620 --> 21:22.650
and take that check you gave him
and rip it the hell up.

21:22.660 --> 21:24.325
- What check?
- The check you gave him

21:24.326 --> 21:27.689
for your partnership money.
You didn't give him one,

21:27.690 --> 21:28.920
did you?
No.

21:28.930 --> 21:30.269
Let me tell you something,
Red.

21:30.270 --> 21:31.859
You want a seat at the table,

21:31.860 --> 21:34.760
you got to put some skin
in the game.

21:52.420 --> 21:54.255
There he is.
Hey, Harvey,

21:54.256 --> 21:56.050
this was a great idea, huh?

21:56.060 --> 21:58.059
Glad I thought of it.
Are we having fun?

21:58.060 --> 21:59.495
If you call
talking geopolitics

21:59.496 --> 22:01.290
with a model named
Svetlana fun,

22:01.300 --> 22:03.465
then that would be
a big, fat bowl of yes.

22:03.466 --> 22:06.090
Easy, tiger.
The bartender's pouring doubles.

22:06.100 --> 22:08.099
Mm.
And what are you getting at?

22:08.100 --> 22:10.360
I'm having another drink.
I said for you to be careful.

22:10.370 --> 22:12.200
I can handle my liquor.
Okay.

22:12.210 --> 22:14.275
How many fingers
am I holding up, huh?

22:14.276 --> 22:16.239
Huh?
You can't tell, can you?

22:16.240 --> 22:18.609
Who can't handle my liquor now?

22:18.610 --> 22:21.440
I'd tell you to put food in
your stomach, but unfortunately,

22:21.450 --> 22:24.219
I only ordered enough to give
the appearance of having food.

22:24.220 --> 22:26.149
So basically,
you're just trying

22:26.150 --> 22:28.219
to get these guys hammered
so you can drive up the bidding.

22:28.220 --> 22:29.580
No.
I told you,

22:29.590 --> 22:31.480
the guys hitting on the models
aren't serious.

22:31.490 --> 22:33.489
Now I'm telling you...
That the guys

22:33.490 --> 22:35.559
who let themselves get drunk
aren't serious,

22:35.560 --> 22:37.390
which means whoever's left
are the bids

22:37.400 --> 22:39.529
that we have in our hands
at the end of the night.

22:39.530 --> 22:41.129
You knew it the whole time,
didn't you?

22:41.130 --> 22:42.399
Who do you think
you're talking to?

22:42.400 --> 22:44.160
Good man.

22:44.170 --> 22:46.400
There's just
one small problem.

22:46.410 --> 22:49.449
What if, by accident,
I happen to be one of the people

22:49.450 --> 22:52.070
that let himself get too drunk?

22:52.080 --> 22:54.109
You just might as well
keep drinking,

22:54.110 --> 22:56.010
'cause if we're not having fun,
what the hell are we doing here?

22:56.020 --> 22:57.519
Yes!
Copy that.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.289
Svetlana...

23:07.660 --> 23:10.020
You know this office isn't
gonna pack itself up, right?

23:10.030 --> 23:11.420
It's not packed
because one of us

23:11.430 --> 23:13.190
has been at work
for the last three hours.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.560
The other one of us
was sleeping off

23:14.570 --> 23:16.439
all the work he did last night.

23:16.440 --> 23:18.439
You mean you're hung over
from all the vodka you drank?

23:18.440 --> 23:20.209
Yeah, that's what I just said.

23:20.210 --> 23:22.145
I never should have
hired you back.

23:22.146 --> 23:24.200
Well, it's too late
to fire me now.

23:24.210 --> 23:25.470
Is it?

23:25.480 --> 23:27.515
Because if you were
worth your salary,

23:27.516 --> 23:29.440
you'd ask how many bids
we're sitting on.

23:29.450 --> 23:33.219
I don't have to ask,
because I've got this.

23:33.220 --> 23:34.610
Guest list was 500,

23:34.620 --> 23:36.450
and half of them
came for the girls.

23:36.460 --> 23:38.695
Half of the other half
don't have the capital,

23:38.696 --> 23:40.689
and 60%
of the rest of them woke up

23:40.690 --> 23:42.659
realizing they don't want
to work in the liquor business.

23:42.660 --> 23:44.660
Take, I don't know, what,

23:44.670 --> 23:47.329
47 off the top
for good measure?

23:47.330 --> 23:50.330
Leaves us with three bids.

23:51.370 --> 23:53.330
- Donna told you, didn't she?
- Probably.

23:53.340 --> 23:55.270
Did she bother telling you
what we're doing now?

23:55.280 --> 23:57.409
She didn't have to,
'cause you're Harvey Specter.

23:57.410 --> 24:00.140
You've got one trick, and you
taught it to me years ago,

24:00.150 --> 24:05.619
so let's go.

24:05.620 --> 24:07.259
You know I have more
than one trick, right?

24:07.260 --> 24:08.619
No, I know you think you do,

24:08.620 --> 24:10.219
but just because you put
on a different costume

24:10.220 --> 24:11.620
doesn't make it
a different trick.

24:11.630 --> 24:13.729
Yeah, I liked you better
when you were drunk.

24:13.730 --> 24:16.700
I liked you better
when I was drunk too.

24:17.430 --> 24:19.160
I don't care what they say.
This is bullshit,

24:19.170 --> 24:20.629
and I'm not gonna get played.

24:20.630 --> 24:22.460
Gentlemen, we're so sorry.
It's my first day.

24:22.470 --> 24:24.239
Evidently,
I booked the conference room

24:24.240 --> 24:25.709
at the same time as Harvey.
Bullshit.

24:25.710 --> 24:27.669
You think we don't know
what's going on here?

24:27.670 --> 24:29.639
You double booked the room
to scare us into overbidding.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.100
You're right.
We should have known

24:31.110 --> 24:32.509
a couple of smart guys like you

24:32.510 --> 24:34.370
would never fall for the banana
in the tailpipe.

24:34.380 --> 24:36.240
We brought you down here
just because you were

24:36.250 --> 24:37.689
the only two bidders
who came in at 100 million,

24:37.690 --> 24:39.649
so now, you have to look
each other in the eye

24:39.650 --> 24:42.280
while you go head-to-head.
So here's what's gonna happen:

24:42.290 --> 24:45.459
You got one chance
to write down your best bid.

24:45.460 --> 24:47.295
Winner takes all,
loser goes home.

24:47.296 --> 24:48.520
We'll be back in 15 minutes,

24:48.530 --> 24:51.469
and we better see
some more zeroes.

24:51.470 --> 24:53.499
What if we collude,
right here?

24:53.500 --> 24:55.399
Stick at 100
and you're shit out of luck?

24:55.400 --> 24:57.130
Which, by the way,
is exactly why

24:57.140 --> 24:58.509
you don't double book
a conference room.

24:58.510 --> 25:00.539
There's only one problem
with that.

25:00.540 --> 25:02.439
When we said you two were the
only ones that came in at 100,

25:02.440 --> 25:05.440
we didn't say there wasn't
someone who put down more.

25:05.450 --> 25:07.209
- Axelrod.
- Bingo.

25:07.210 --> 25:08.679
Second bid came
in 20 minutes ago.

25:08.680 --> 25:10.740
So if you two want to collude,
go right ahead,

25:10.750 --> 25:14.310
but it better be for a hell
of a lot more than 100 million.

25:18.190 --> 25:20.420
- How'd it go?
- That depends.

25:20.430 --> 25:23.699
What was Axelrod's second bid?
200 million.

25:23.700 --> 25:25.439
Well, then it doesn't
really matter how it went,

25:25.440 --> 25:27.460
because whatever
those clowns come up with,

25:27.470 --> 25:29.409
Neil Stillman's walking away
with a boatload of cash.

25:29.410 --> 25:31.800
Speaking of boatloads
of cash...

25:35.670 --> 25:37.670
It's a check
for half a million dollars.

25:37.680 --> 25:39.719
I told you I was serious about
becoming a partner, and I am.

25:39.720 --> 25:41.710
- Donna...
- Harvey, be honest.

25:41.720 --> 25:43.590
You haven't given one thought to
what we talked about yesterday.

25:43.580 --> 25:45.249
- I've been a little busy.
- And you've also been

25:45.250 --> 25:47.210
avoiding the subject.
This way,

25:47.220 --> 25:49.450
you have to take me seriously.
I do take you seriously.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.325
Then walk the hell down
to Louis' office

25:51.326 --> 25:53.589
and tell him I'm a partner.
Donna, I can't just ram

25:53.590 --> 25:55.620
every decision down his throat.
Every decision?

25:55.630 --> 25:56.729
You haven't even told him that
you're stepping

25:56.730 --> 25:58.320
into Jessica's shoes yet.

25:58.330 --> 25:59.829
I'm waiting
for the right time.

25:59.830 --> 26:01.590
And if I were a partner,
I would tell you that

26:01.600 --> 26:03.460
the right time was yesterday.
Donna...

26:03.470 --> 26:05.300
Harvey, you think
I'm asking for charity, I'm not.

26:05.310 --> 26:06.709
I am asking for you
to make official

26:06.710 --> 26:08.809
what I have been doing
for years anyway,

26:08.810 --> 26:10.709
which is giving you advice,
like you need to step

26:10.710 --> 26:12.740
the hell up and tell Louis
that you're in charge,

26:12.750 --> 26:14.719
and right this second, you're
either gonna take that advice,

26:14.720 --> 26:18.340
or you're not,
but it is time

26:18.350 --> 26:20.710
that you recognize me

26:20.720 --> 26:23.250
for what I do.

26:32.530 --> 26:34.760
My brother Thomas is
the clever one.

26:34.770 --> 26:39.539
Teaches at Cambridge.
20 hours a week, summers off.

26:39.540 --> 26:41.580
You're not listening to a word
I'm saying, are you?

26:44.780 --> 26:47.809
- I'm sorry.
- Well, you should be.

26:47.810 --> 26:50.579
I've been told
I'm actually quite delightful.

26:50.580 --> 26:52.880
You are.
I'm just a little distracted.

26:52.890 --> 26:54.655
Halfway through appetizers.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.619
Doesn't bode very well
for how you'll be feeling

26:56.620 --> 26:58.380
when our flambé arrives.
It's not that.

26:58.390 --> 26:59.789
Jessica left the firm
last month.

26:59.790 --> 27:01.820
Everyone assumes
that I'm next in line,

27:01.830 --> 27:03.799
and now I've got Donna telling
me that if I don't step up...

27:03.800 --> 27:05.499
Wait a second, I thought you
told me as of the other morning

27:05.500 --> 27:06.869
that you're now head
of the firm.

27:06.870 --> 27:08.739
I am. I just haven't
told Louis yet,

27:08.740 --> 27:10.669
and Donna won't let it go.

27:10.670 --> 27:12.400
I think this may have
been a mistake.

27:12.410 --> 27:13.909
- What?
- You didn't come to me

27:13.910 --> 27:15.479
to date me, you came to me
because you're in the middle

27:15.480 --> 27:16.909
of another crisis
and you need me

27:16.910 --> 27:18.540
to walk you through it.
That's not true.

27:18.550 --> 27:19.879
Of course you don't think
it's true.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.770
If you did,
you would have called my office

27:21.780 --> 27:23.410
and made an appointment.
I don't need an appointment.

27:23.420 --> 27:25.419
I'm sharing things
about my life.

27:25.420 --> 27:27.689
Last time I checked,
that's what people do on dates.

27:27.690 --> 27:30.459
Yes, it's what they do,
Harvey, but on first dates,

27:30.460 --> 27:32.899
they also try to make
the other person feel special

27:32.900 --> 27:35.290
and listened to.
Paula--

27:35.300 --> 27:37.359
Do you know why it's unethical
for a therapist

27:37.360 --> 27:38.560
to go out with her client,
Harvey?

27:38.570 --> 27:39.935
Yeah, of course I do.

27:39.936 --> 27:41.690
It's because it's natural
for a client

27:41.700 --> 27:43.299
to transfer feelings of desire

27:43.300 --> 27:44.760
onto his therapist
that aren't real.

27:44.770 --> 27:46.469
- I know that.
- What you may not know

27:46.470 --> 27:47.769
is that it's not unnatural

27:47.770 --> 27:50.839
for a therapist
to feel the same way.

27:50.840 --> 27:53.409
You don't think I've had
fantasies about you?

27:53.410 --> 27:55.340
That one day you'd show up
at my office

27:55.350 --> 27:56.649
as I was heading home
for the night,

27:56.650 --> 27:58.849
and I turn around,
and you'd be there.

27:58.850 --> 28:01.580
You wouldn't say a word, but...

28:01.590 --> 28:05.529
You'd take me
in your arms and kiss me, and...

28:05.530 --> 28:07.859
It would actually be the start
of something special.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.890
Well, I have,

28:09.900 --> 28:11.399
which is why
despite my better judgment,

28:11.400 --> 28:12.899
I'm here with you right now.

28:12.900 --> 28:15.499
- So what's the problem?
- The problem is those fantasies

28:15.500 --> 28:16.960
weren't of me being
a therapist to a man

28:16.970 --> 28:19.400
who's still too afraid
to admit that he needs help,

28:19.410 --> 28:23.739
much less take control
of a firm that bears his name.

28:23.740 --> 28:25.670
Thank you for dinner, Harvey.

28:25.680 --> 28:27.749
If you need a session,
call my office.

28:27.750 --> 28:30.349
Unfortunately,
I can't see you anymore,

28:30.350 --> 28:31.580
but I can give you
a recommendation

28:31.590 --> 28:33.989
for someone who can.

28:46.530 --> 28:48.560
- Louis, what can I do--
- Do for me?

28:48.570 --> 28:50.510
You could tell me from now on
if you have a problem with me,

28:50.500 --> 28:52.600
you'll take it up with me
instead of going behind my back.

28:52.610 --> 28:53.739
- What?
- That's right.

28:53.740 --> 28:55.570
You think I don't know the whole

28:55.580 --> 28:56.909
"Rachel should be in charge
of my associates"

28:56.910 --> 28:58.670
bullshit came from you
and not Donna?

28:58.680 --> 29:01.449
You're right.
It was from me.

29:01.450 --> 29:05.389
And I came to you first,
and you bit my head off.

29:05.390 --> 29:07.489
Well, then let me tell you
in a way

29:07.490 --> 29:09.559
that won't harm
your pretty little head,

29:09.560 --> 29:12.829
because I clearly forgot what a
delicate little flower you are.

29:12.830 --> 29:14.689
Those associates are mine,

29:14.690 --> 29:16.520
and the only way
you're ever gonna get them

29:16.530 --> 29:19.499
is if you pry them
from my cold, dead hands.

29:36.820 --> 29:38.689
Donna, unless
it's an emergency--

29:38.690 --> 29:40.549
It is an emergency.

29:40.550 --> 29:41.950
Harvey, I need to know
what you're doing about me.

29:41.960 --> 29:43.959
Donna, right this second
is not the time.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.829
<i>It is the time,
because if somebody doesn't</i>

29:45.830 --> 29:47.829
do something about Louis soon,

29:47.830 --> 29:50.629
this firm is gonna end up being
sued by our own associates.

29:50.630 --> 29:52.490
I don't have the authority
to do anything,

29:52.500 --> 29:55.899
and you don't even know
what I'm talking about.

29:55.900 --> 29:57.960
Okay, Donna.

29:57.970 --> 30:02.600
You win.
You're a partner.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.510
Harvey.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.050
We got a problem.

30:16.060 --> 30:17.459
What is it now?

30:17.460 --> 30:19.560
Take a look.

30:20.830 --> 30:22.559
Where'd you get this?

30:22.560 --> 30:24.260
It doesn't matter
where I got it.

30:24.270 --> 30:25.569
It's out there.

30:25.570 --> 30:27.299
You can't be sure
Neil knew this.

30:27.300 --> 30:28.360
What difference
does that make?

30:28.370 --> 30:30.309
Because if he didn't know,

30:30.310 --> 30:32.409
it's just bad luck.
Harvey, he's the goddamn CEO.

30:32.410 --> 30:34.079
He knew.
He kept it from us,

30:34.080 --> 30:35.609
and he kept it from the guys
buying his company.

30:35.610 --> 30:37.470
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.049
I also know you still have time
to go stop this sale

30:39.050 --> 30:40.849
from going through.
Are you kidding?

30:40.850 --> 30:42.989
They signed the documents.
It's already gone through.

30:42.990 --> 30:44.480
Money hasn't
changed hands yet,

30:44.490 --> 30:47.019
so you still have time
to stop it.

30:47.020 --> 30:48.519
- Mike--
- Harvey, if you don't

30:48.520 --> 30:50.250
get over there
and find out before--

30:50.260 --> 30:52.859
All right.
I'll handle it.

30:52.860 --> 30:56.320
- And where are you going?
- I need to talk to Louis.

30:56.330 --> 30:58.390
Whatever it is, it's gonna
have to wait until tomorrow,

30:58.400 --> 30:59.539
because if you don't
get over there

30:59.540 --> 31:01.399
before that money changes hands,

31:01.400 --> 31:03.630
you are opening us up
to a shitload of trouble.

31:13.280 --> 31:16.310
Kind of creepy in here
at night, isn't it?

31:16.320 --> 31:19.949
Oh, I don't know.
I find it kind of peaceful.

31:19.950 --> 31:22.419
Then why get rid of it?
And more importantly,

31:22.420 --> 31:24.420
why'd you need the sale
to go through so quickly?

31:24.430 --> 31:27.059
I told you,
I have another opportunity.

31:27.060 --> 31:29.090
And what if I said
the real reason was

31:29.100 --> 31:31.369
you knew you vodka business
was about to be sued

31:31.370 --> 31:33.069
for using
another brand's recipe?

31:33.070 --> 31:35.305
I would say
I did not know that.

31:35.306 --> 31:37.500
- Well, now you do.
- It doesn't change a thing.

31:37.510 --> 31:40.039
Those two dipshits already
signed the agreement.

31:40.040 --> 31:42.500
Neil, this looks a hell of
a lot like you're asking me

31:42.510 --> 31:45.909
to be a party to fraud.
I'm asking you to do your job.

31:45.910 --> 31:49.010
Look out for my interests,
and take me at my word.

31:49.020 --> 31:51.060
If I have reason to believe
that you're lying to me,

31:51.061 --> 31:52.610
which I do--
The only thing you have

31:52.620 --> 31:54.919
reason to believe is that
I will fire you

31:54.920 --> 31:57.950
if you don't do this for me
and then find someone who will,

31:57.960 --> 32:00.529
so this thing is gonna get done
whether you do it or not.

32:00.530 --> 32:02.465
The only thing
that happens if you don't

32:02.466 --> 32:05.629
is that the world will know
what people suspect already:

32:05.630 --> 32:08.460
That you can't fill
Jessica's shoes.

32:08.470 --> 32:10.609
How long do you think
it's gonna take after that

32:10.610 --> 32:13.379
before every one of your clients
starts to leave you?

32:13.380 --> 32:16.940
So you tell me right now,

32:16.950 --> 32:19.679
are you in or not?

32:27.390 --> 32:29.625
- Shit. Oliver.
- What's up, Mike?

32:29.626 --> 32:31.520
How's your new job?
I'm sorry.

32:31.530 --> 32:33.559
I swear I was gonna tell you.
Yeah, I heard,

32:33.560 --> 32:35.620
but I guess when you move on,
you move on, right?

32:35.630 --> 32:37.629
- Come on, it's not like that.
- Bullshit, it's not like that.

32:37.630 --> 32:39.560
You left, Mike,
after everything you said.

32:39.570 --> 32:40.969
Would you please
just let me explain?

32:40.970 --> 32:42.599
I fought for your goddamn job.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.600
I know that, and I will
always be grateful for it,

32:44.610 --> 32:46.379
but I am telling you,
it's better this way, because--

32:46.380 --> 32:48.139
Better for who?
Based on that extra cash

32:48.140 --> 32:50.070
that you had to throw at Nathan?

32:50.080 --> 32:52.149
I'd say it's better for you.
For everybody.

32:52.150 --> 32:53.985
I can still have cases
with the clinic.

32:53.986 --> 32:55.540
You and I can still
work together.

32:55.550 --> 32:57.480
- Lucky me.
- Oliver, the only reason I went

32:57.490 --> 32:59.719
back is that Harvey committed
to doing pro bonos, all right?

32:59.720 --> 33:01.380
Half of my cases,

33:01.390 --> 33:03.059
the kind the clinic does,
only this time,

33:03.060 --> 33:05.059
with the resources
of a big firm behind us.

33:05.060 --> 33:06.459
Oh, really?
What are you working on

33:06.460 --> 33:08.120
right now, Mike?
What?

33:08.130 --> 33:10.469
What's your first case back?
Eminent domain?

33:10.470 --> 33:12.529
Civil rights violation?
Oliver, come on,

33:12.530 --> 33:14.160
it's not that--
Tell me your first case back

33:14.170 --> 33:16.539
isn't carrying water
for some corporate big shot,

33:16.540 --> 33:19.210
and I'll shut my mouth
right now.

33:20.770 --> 33:22.639
Marissa was right.

33:22.640 --> 33:26.540
All you were doing with us
was biding your time.

33:40.630 --> 33:43.565
- What the fu-- is going on?
- What do you mean?

33:43.566 --> 33:45.160
Case is over.
You said you'd move.

33:45.170 --> 33:47.099
I'm just getting
the ball rolling.

33:47.100 --> 33:48.630
I can't work on my own cases
if I don't have my own office.

33:48.640 --> 33:50.099
Listen, Mike.

33:50.100 --> 33:52.030
You let the goddamn sale
go through.

33:52.040 --> 33:54.039
- You don't understand.
- I understand that you said

33:54.040 --> 33:56.570
that you wanted one last case
together before you stepped up,

33:56.580 --> 33:59.079
but you clearly are
not ready to step up,

33:59.080 --> 34:01.579
so I got to get
my pro Bono cases in

34:01.580 --> 34:03.540
before this place
doesn't even exist anymore.

34:03.550 --> 34:06.610
Are you finished,
or do you have a minute to hear

34:06.620 --> 34:08.780
why I let the sale go through?
Oh, no, I don't care.

34:08.790 --> 34:12.688
Mike, I have no proof he knew.
He's Jessica's client.

34:12.690 --> 34:14.620
How's it gonna look
if he tells the world

34:14.630 --> 34:16.199
that we can't handle
his business anymore?

34:16.199 --> 34:18.069
Well, I'll tell you
how it looks right now.

34:18.070 --> 34:20.139
It looks like you're afraid
and you're not in charge.

34:20.141 --> 34:21.799
Okay, you say something
like that to me,

34:21.800 --> 34:23.460
you better get ready for a hit,

34:23.469 --> 34:25.069
because I am doing
the best I can.

34:25.070 --> 34:26.730
No, Harvey,
you're not doing shit.

34:26.739 --> 34:28.600
You're hiding,
'cause you're afraid.

34:28.610 --> 34:31.279
You're afraid to take
responsibility for this firm,

34:31.280 --> 34:32.748
and you won't admit it
to yourself.

34:32.750 --> 34:33.849
I don't have
to listen to this.

34:33.850 --> 34:37.248
Well, you're going to,

34:37.250 --> 34:39.179
'cause way back when,
you cared enough about me

34:39.190 --> 34:40.688
to tell me the same thing
to my face,

34:40.690 --> 34:42.688
and I'm just
returning the favor.

34:48.699 --> 34:51.629
I'm not her, Mike.

34:51.630 --> 34:55.830
I'm not her.
You don't have to be her.

34:55.840 --> 34:59.239
You just have to go back
to being you.

34:59.240 --> 35:01.600
The Harvey I met the day
you hired me,

35:01.610 --> 35:03.349
he would have gone in there
and told Neil Stillman

35:03.350 --> 35:05.770
to go fu-- himself.

35:05.780 --> 35:08.210
So it's up to you.

35:08.220 --> 35:10.589
You can keep hiding out
in Jessica's shadow,

35:10.590 --> 35:12.149
or you get out of it

35:12.150 --> 35:15.580
and start being
Harvey goddamn Specter.

35:33.741 --> 35:37.109
Do you find it peaceful here
in the day too?

35:37.110 --> 35:40.410
If you're here to bring me
my check, then the answer's yes.

35:40.420 --> 35:43.749
I'm here to tell you
that we stopped the sale.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.710
What did you just say?

35:45.720 --> 35:47.580
We're not taking part
in your fraud

35:47.590 --> 35:49.659
so that you can dump
your shitty company.

35:49.660 --> 35:51.729
You son of a bitch, I don't
remember giving you a choice.

35:51.730 --> 35:54.065
Well, you did,
because your exact words were,

35:54.066 --> 35:56.690
"Do it, or you're fired."
Then you're goddamn fired.

35:56.700 --> 35:59.099
You can let us go if you want,
but the second you do,

35:59.100 --> 36:00.699
we're putting out
a press release saying

36:00.700 --> 36:03.530
Pearson Specter Litt
no longer represents clients

36:03.540 --> 36:06.679
we feel are unethical
in their divestiture practices.

36:06.680 --> 36:09.109
You can't do that, that's
attorney-client privilege.

36:09.110 --> 36:11.809
No, it's not, because
we're not gonna name you.

36:11.810 --> 36:13.779
But you can bet your ass
the whole world

36:13.780 --> 36:16.710
is gonna know
who we're talking about.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.389
What do you want from me?

36:18.390 --> 36:19.759
Are you asking me
as my client?

36:19.760 --> 36:21.659
Because I don't give
free legal advice.

36:21.660 --> 36:23.829
Yes, okay.
You're still my attorney.

36:23.830 --> 36:26.429
In that case,
here's what's gonna happen:

36:26.430 --> 36:27.729
You're gonna go into business

36:27.730 --> 36:29.599
with the guys
whose process you stole.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.829
You're gonna quietly give them
10% of your company,

36:31.830 --> 36:33.730
you're gonna triple your price,
and you're gonna have

36:33.740 --> 36:36.739
a very public feud
over whose vodka tastes better.

36:36.740 --> 36:39.539
And then we both profit
from a war

36:39.540 --> 36:42.539
between two brands that have
the exact same product.

36:42.540 --> 36:45.009
Win-win.

36:45.010 --> 36:46.570
Maybe you are
as good as Jessica.

36:46.580 --> 36:48.610
Maybe I am.
Maybe I'm not.

36:48.620 --> 36:50.489
But the thing
we have in common is

36:50.490 --> 36:52.659
we're never gonna be bullied
by any of our clients.

37:15.040 --> 37:16.770
All right, Louis,
I've tried to be reasonable,

37:16.780 --> 37:18.879
but I'm not gonna sit around
and watch this anymore.

37:18.880 --> 37:20.779
As of this moment,
you're no longer

37:20.780 --> 37:22.679
in charge of the associates.
Says you and what army?

37:22.680 --> 37:24.480
I'm sorry,
I didn't catch that.

37:24.490 --> 37:26.189
- I said you can't do that.
- Oh, yes, I can,

37:26.190 --> 37:27.829
because even though Harvey
clearly didn't tell you,

37:27.830 --> 37:30.050
as of last night,
I'm a senior partner.

37:30.060 --> 37:31.789
- You're what?
- That's right.

37:31.790 --> 37:33.089
I gave Harvey a check
for half a million dollars.

37:33.090 --> 37:34.720
I'm a partner now, Louis,

37:34.730 --> 37:36.529
which means your whole

37:36.530 --> 37:38.860
"you're up here
and I'm down here" bullshit,

37:38.870 --> 37:40.599
not anymore.
Partner?

37:40.600 --> 37:42.230
You're not even a lawyer.
Neither are

37:42.240 --> 37:43.809
the chief operating officers
of four

37:43.810 --> 37:45.569
of the top nine firms
in the world.

37:45.570 --> 37:47.570
This is bullshit.
I didn't agree to any of this.

37:47.580 --> 37:49.249
I don't care whether
you agreed to it or not.

37:49.250 --> 37:51.509
You're gonna live with it.
And I don't give a shit

37:51.510 --> 37:54.079
what your supposed title is.
I'm not giving up my associates.

37:54.080 --> 37:55.840
And if you think you're gonna
leave this bathroom

37:55.850 --> 37:57.810
without giving me
the respect I deserve--

37:57.820 --> 37:59.555
I'm not giving up
my associates.

37:59.556 --> 38:01.519
- That's enough.
- Harvey, what the hell

38:01.520 --> 38:03.689
kind of shit did you pull?
Shut up and listen, Louis.

38:03.690 --> 38:05.620
Donna asked for a seat
at the table,

38:05.630 --> 38:07.569
and I gave her one,
because when she worked for me,

38:07.570 --> 38:08.920
she had my back,

38:08.930 --> 38:11.090
and would kill anyone
coming for me,

38:11.100 --> 38:13.705
and when she worked for you,
she did the same exact thing,

38:13.706 --> 38:15.560
not to mention
if she left tomorrow,

38:15.570 --> 38:17.930
this firm would be a pile
of rubble within 15 minutes.

38:17.940 --> 38:19.609
So then give her a raise.

38:19.610 --> 38:21.579
You don't make her
goddamn senior partner.

38:21.580 --> 38:23.719
If Jessica were here, she'd tell
you to do the same exact thing.

38:23.720 --> 38:26.640
Well, Louis,
Jessica isn't here,

38:26.650 --> 38:29.190
but I am.

38:31.250 --> 38:33.250
- Thank you, Harvey.
- Don't thank me yet.

38:33.260 --> 38:35.859
You asked for a vote.
You got it.

38:35.860 --> 38:39.195
But the person who's gonna
decide when that vote is is me,

38:39.196 --> 38:41.690
and I say our first
order of business

38:41.700 --> 38:43.599
is putting out word
that Harvey Specter

38:43.600 --> 38:44.969
is the new managing partner.

38:44.970 --> 38:47.569
Now, you want to vote on that?
Let's do it.

38:47.570 --> 38:49.305
But if it's not unanimous,

38:49.306 --> 38:51.869
we're gonna have a big problem.

38:51.870 --> 38:54.270
No problem here.

38:56.180 --> 38:57.849
What about you, Louis?

38:57.850 --> 39:00.219
You got a problem
with me calling the shots?

39:00.220 --> 39:02.819
No, Harvey.

39:02.820 --> 39:04.755
No problem.
You're managing partner.

39:04.756 --> 39:06.550
Good.
Then I suggest the two of you

39:06.560 --> 39:08.289
get your shit together
before tomorrow,

39:08.290 --> 39:10.989
because right now, I've got
some things to take care of.

39:25.210 --> 39:26.709
I don't want to talk to you
right now, Louis--

39:26.710 --> 39:29.639
I want you to have
the associates.

39:29.640 --> 39:31.009
Whatever you said to Donna,
you were right.

39:31.010 --> 39:32.809
- Louis...
- Rachel, just let me finish

39:32.810 --> 39:35.610
while I'm still able
to get it out.

39:35.620 --> 39:39.589
I know I can be rough on them...

39:39.590 --> 39:40.929
But it's only because
I want to see them

39:40.930 --> 39:42.919
become the best lawyers
they can be.

39:42.920 --> 39:45.650
But I'm not
in the best headspace right now,

39:45.660 --> 39:47.590
and if I keep taking my anger
out on them,

39:47.600 --> 39:49.199
they will not become
great lawyers.

39:49.200 --> 39:53.969
They might not stay
in the law at all, so...

39:53.970 --> 39:56.305
It's better that someone else
takes over for a while,

39:56.306 --> 39:58.630
and I cannot think
of a better person than you.

39:58.640 --> 40:00.800
I'm sorry that I went
behind your back, Louis.

40:00.810 --> 40:02.279
You were right to.

40:02.280 --> 40:03.915
If you had asked me
face-to-face,

40:03.916 --> 40:05.809
I don't even know
what I would have done,

40:05.810 --> 40:09.810
and that--just thinking
about that makes me sick.

40:09.820 --> 40:12.649
Rachel, you're family,

40:12.650 --> 40:14.380
and if I lose you too...

40:14.390 --> 40:16.829
Louis, you're not going
to lose me,

40:16.830 --> 40:18.829
but I think
I know what you may need.

40:18.830 --> 40:20.699
Please don't say vacation.

40:20.700 --> 40:22.729
If someone else mentions
Martha's Vineyard one more time,

40:22.730 --> 40:26.760
I swear to God...
I was gonna say closure.

40:26.770 --> 40:28.809
If you're telling me that
I need to talk to Tara--

40:28.810 --> 40:31.630
Louis, you were gonna
get married.

40:31.640 --> 40:34.839
You were gonna be a father.

40:34.840 --> 40:38.870
That can't all end
over a voicemail.

40:43.080 --> 40:45.810
Treat them well.

40:56.100 --> 41:00.039
- I knew it.
- Knew what?

41:00.040 --> 41:03.739
You don't have the balls
to fill Harvey's office.

41:03.740 --> 41:05.409
Okay, Donna,
just to be clear,

41:05.410 --> 41:07.409
balls do not make the man.

41:07.410 --> 41:09.709
- That's not what Rachel says.
- What does that even mean?

41:09.710 --> 41:10.870
I think we both know
what that means.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.879
Donna, for the record,
my balls

41:12.880 --> 41:14.410
are within normal parameters.

41:14.420 --> 41:15.949
So you just come down here
to give me shit,

41:15.950 --> 41:17.749
or was there maybe
another reason?

41:17.750 --> 41:18.949
What other reason
would I have?

41:18.950 --> 41:20.450
I can't think of a single one.

41:20.460 --> 41:22.289
- Then my work here is done.
- Good.

41:22.290 --> 41:23.920
Because I certainly didn't
come down here to tell you

41:23.930 --> 41:27.029
I remember the first time
you were in this office,

41:27.030 --> 41:28.729
and I never thought
I'd see the day

41:28.730 --> 41:32.290
when I told you
congratulations, Mike.

41:32.300 --> 41:34.730
You deserve it as your own.

41:34.740 --> 41:38.110
- Thanks, Donna.
- You're welcome, Mike.

41:39.740 --> 41:42.400
Are you sure
you don't come with it?

41:42.410 --> 41:44.040
I mean, there is a desk
right there

41:44.050 --> 41:45.915
that literally has
your name on it.

41:45.916 --> 41:47.340
Sorry, I wish I could,

41:47.350 --> 41:49.049
but I actually got
a new office too.

41:49.050 --> 41:50.780
- You did?
- Needed one,

41:50.790 --> 41:52.389
because as of tomorrow,
I am officially

41:52.390 --> 41:54.789
the firm's newest
senior partner.

41:54.790 --> 41:56.489
Holy shit.
Are you serious?

41:56.490 --> 41:58.820
Yes.
And from now on, it's,

41:58.830 --> 42:01.459
"Are you serious, ma'am?"

42:01.460 --> 42:03.490
Have you got that, pretty boy?
My God.

42:03.500 --> 42:05.739
Harvey's created a monster,
hasn't he?

42:05.740 --> 42:08.030
You have no idea.

42:08.040 --> 42:10.809
Donna...

42:10.810 --> 42:12.809
It's about time.

42:26.120 --> 42:30.520
Hey.
I know we haven't spoken,

42:30.530 --> 42:34.359
and we didn't exactly
leave things off well,

42:34.360 --> 42:37.760
but...

42:37.770 --> 42:39.499
I just really need
to see you tonight

42:39.500 --> 42:42.499
if at all possible.

43:03.990 --> 43:07.960
Guess you got some skin
in the game after all.

43:09.130 --> 43:13.169
Sure did, Gretchen.

43:13.170 --> 43:15.539
Sure did.
