WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.573
I HAVE GOT TO GO.

00:02.573 --> 00:03.774
BYE.

00:03.774 --> 00:06.006
BYE.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.008
OOH. THAT EXACT MOMENT HAPPENED
IN MY DREAM LAST NIGHT.

00:08.008 --> 00:11.582
YEAH, AND THEN THE TOPS CAME OFF
AND THE MUSIC KICKED IN.

00:11.582 --> 00:14.645
в™Є BOW WA WA WA WA, WA WA WA в™Є
в™Є WA WA, WA WA WA в™Є

00:14.645 --> 00:16.387
(imitates cymbal hits)
в™Є WA OOH OOH, WA OOH OOH в™Є

00:16.387 --> 00:18.749
MY MOTHER USED TO KISS HER
FRIENDS GOOD-BYE ON THE LIPS.

00:18.749 --> 00:21.122
IT LET THEM KNOW
THEY WERE SPECIAL.

00:21.122 --> 00:24.024
SO I DECIDED TO DO THAT
WITH ALL OF MY BEST FRIENDS.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.057
WELL, I SHOULD GET GOING.

00:26.057 --> 00:28.359
(clears throat)

00:28.359 --> 00:29.600
BYE, TOM.

00:29.600 --> 00:32.032
GOD.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.804
HEY, I'D LIKE ONE OF THOSE
FRIEND GOOD-BYE KISSES.

00:33.804 --> 00:38.069
SWEETIE, THEY'RE ONLY
FOR BEST FRIENDS.

00:39.570 --> 00:42.113
BYE, BUDDY.

00:46.777 --> 00:48.549
I SAW THAT COMING.

00:48.549 --> 00:51.051
COME ON!

00:51.051 --> 00:55.786
в™Єв™Єв™Є

00:55.786 --> 00:57.828
SO LAURIE AND I HAVE
THIS NEW TRAINER--

00:57.828 --> 00:59.790
"CRAZY CHRIS."

00:59.790 --> 01:01.562
WELL, ACTUALLY, HE'S AN EX-CON
THAT WE PAY TO YELL AT US

01:01.562 --> 01:03.063
SO WE WORK OUT HARDER.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.196
HE SAYS ALL I NEED TO DO
IS LOWER MY CARBS

01:05.196 --> 01:09.240
AND GET CRAZY WIRY SO ESES
IN THE YARD THINK I'M LOCO.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.442
YOUR TRAINER'S NAME
IS CRAZY CHRIS?

01:11.442 --> 01:13.444
HIS REAL NAME IS
CRAZY CHRIS THE NIGHTMARE MAN,

01:13.444 --> 01:16.177
BUT HE SHORTENED IT
TO SOUND MORE PROFESSIONAL.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.408
HERE'S THE BAD NEWS.

01:17.408 --> 01:19.210
HE SAYS THAT CALORIE-WISE,

01:19.210 --> 01:22.353
A GLASS OF WINE IS THE SAME
AS A SLICE OF CHOCOLATE CAKE.

01:22.353 --> 01:23.554
I DON'T BUY IT.

01:23.554 --> 01:25.516
HEY, TOM, RECYCLE THIS.

01:25.516 --> 01:27.418
(shatters)
OOH.

01:27.418 --> 01:28.619
(dog barking in distance)
TOM'S BEEN KIND OF A.W.O.L.

01:28.619 --> 01:30.421
SINCE YOU DENIED HIM
THAT GOOD-BYE KISS.

01:30.421 --> 01:32.523
WAS I TOO HARD ON TOM?

01:32.523 --> 01:34.395
(whispers) WHO CARES?

01:34.395 --> 01:37.798
(imitating Tom)
UH, IT'S OKAY, JULES.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.600
I'LL JUST BE OVER
AT MY HOUSE,

01:39.600 --> 01:41.472
WAITING TO DIE.

01:41.472 --> 01:43.474
AND YOU'RE DONE.

01:49.580 --> 01:51.342
BOOM! I JUST CRUSHED IT
ON MY DATE

01:51.342 --> 01:53.284
WITH THE HOT DOG DOCTOR.

01:53.284 --> 01:55.886
HE MEANS HOT... DOG DOCTOR.

01:55.886 --> 01:57.788
SHE'S A VETERINARIAN.

01:57.788 --> 02:00.351
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH WHICH WORD TO EMPHASIZE.

02:00.351 --> 02:02.553
YEAH, I SHOULDA SAID
HOT DOG DOCTOR.

02:02.553 --> 02:06.427
NO, THAT WOULD BE
A RULE-BREAKING BADASS SURGEON.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.529
ANYWAY, I MET NICOLE WHEN I
TOOK DOG TRAVIS TO THE VET.

02:08.529 --> 02:11.332
YOU GUYS REMEMBER WHEN HE HAD
THAT BAD SLEEP-HUMPING PROBLEM?

02:11.332 --> 02:13.334
OH, BOBBY, YOU DON'T STILL
SLEEP NUDE, DO YOU?

02:13.334 --> 02:15.236
MAN, DOGS JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND THE WORD "NO."

02:15.236 --> 02:16.867
I FEEL LIKE THEY DO.

02:16.867 --> 02:18.839
FELLAS, I'M REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT THIS WOMAN.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.212
SHE'S SMART, SHE'S CLASSY...
(cell phone alert chimes)

02:21.212 --> 02:22.913
AND I'M READY
FOR A REAL RELATIONSHIP.

02:22.913 --> 02:24.815
THIS COULD BE
SOMETHING SPECIAL.
(beep)

02:24.815 --> 02:27.818
AND I DON'T THINK SHE WANTS
TO SEE ME AGAIN.

02:27.818 --> 02:30.551
WELL, DON'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS.
WHAT'S IT SAY?

02:30.551 --> 02:31.882
"I DON'T WANT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN."

02:31.882 --> 02:33.854
THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR.
(mouths words)

02:33.854 --> 02:36.387
OH, GOOD, THERE'S TOM.
I CAN APOLOGIZE.

02:36.387 --> 02:38.158
OH, WAIT.
HE'S WITH A WOMAN.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.730
WELL, I'M SURE IT'S JUST
A RELATIVE OR SOMETHING.

02:39.730 --> 02:40.931
PROBABLY A COUSIN.

02:40.931 --> 02:42.693
UH...

02:42.693 --> 02:44.435
STILL COULD BE A COUSIN.

02:44.435 --> 02:46.297
COUSIN STUFF
CAN BE HOT.

02:46.297 --> 02:49.370
IT'S LIKE THEY INSTINCTIVELY
KNOW WHAT TURNS YOU ON.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.342
AND THAT'S HOW
JELLIES ARE MADE.

02:51.342 --> 02:52.603
HEY, TOM.

02:52.603 --> 02:54.845
WE HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN A WHILE.

02:54.845 --> 02:56.647
I HOPE I DIDN'T
HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

02:56.647 --> 02:58.178
OH, NO, JULES.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.450
I'M JUST HANGING WITH
MY GIRLFRIEND JESSICA.

02:59.450 --> 03:00.751
(giggles)

03:00.751 --> 03:02.553
THAT'S RIGHT, WORLD.
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

03:02.553 --> 03:04.184
(Jessica) YEAH, YOU DO.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.686
GO AHEAD. SMACK THAT ASS.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.218
LET IT KNOW
WHO IT BELONGS TO.

03:07.218 --> 03:08.889
UH, OVER OR UNDER?

03:08.889 --> 03:10.321
I THINK WE ALL VOTE OVER.

03:10.321 --> 03:11.522
(Laurie and Ellie) OVER.

03:11.522 --> 03:12.723
(smacks)
OH.

03:12.723 --> 03:14.194
OH, MY GOODNESS.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.397
YOUR PURSE COULD BE
MY PURSE'S MOM.

03:16.397 --> 03:19.730
YOU MUST BE JULES. TOMMY SAYS
HE HANGS OUTSIDE YOUR WINDOW.

03:19.730 --> 03:21.472
AND YOU JUST IGNORED
THAT RED FLAG, HUH?

03:21.472 --> 03:22.903
(whispers indistinctly)

03:22.903 --> 03:25.476
SO TOM'S GOT A GIRLFRIEND.
MM-HMM.

03:25.476 --> 03:28.279
DOES SHE NOT LIKE ELLIE?
WHAT? WHY?

03:28.279 --> 03:30.311
JUST ASSUMING.
OH, FAIR ENOUGH.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.543
WHEN DID YOU GO TO
A YEAH YEAH YEAHS CONCERT?

03:32.543 --> 03:34.214
OH, I DIDN'T.
I JUST LIKE THE SHIRT.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.487
SO... YOUR SHIRT'S A LIE.

03:36.487 --> 03:38.289
I HATE LIE SHIRTS.

03:38.289 --> 03:39.990
LIE SHIRTS SAY,
"OH, LOOK AT ME.

03:39.990 --> 03:41.952
I'M PRETENDING TO BE
SOMETHING THAT I'M NOT."

03:41.952 --> 03:44.955
OR THEY JUST SAY,
"HEY, I'M A SHIRT."

03:44.955 --> 03:46.357
I'M WITH JULES.

03:46.357 --> 03:47.998
WHEN I WEAR A SHIRT--

03:47.998 --> 03:50.501
HEY, JELLYBEAN,
IF YOU'RE GONNA VOMIT OUT

03:50.501 --> 03:52.533
ONE OF YOUR LONG,
BORING-ASS STORIES,

03:52.533 --> 03:54.465
WOULD YOU DO ME A SOLID
AND RAISE YOUR HAND

03:54.465 --> 03:56.507
WHEN YOU HIT
THE HALFWAY POINT?

03:56.507 --> 04:00.311
IF I WEAR A SHIRT, YOU'D BETTER
BELIEVE THAT IT IS TRUE.

04:00.311 --> 04:02.273
EVEN MY FEMALE BOOTY INSPECTOR
SHIRT.

04:02.273 --> 04:03.974
THAT'S AN ACTUAL JOB
THAT I HAD ONCE

04:03.974 --> 04:05.516
AT A BAR IN KEY WEST.

04:05.516 --> 04:07.247
AT MIDNIGHT,
ALL THE DRUNK COLLEGE GIRLS

04:07.247 --> 04:09.820
WOULD COME OUT ON THE STAGE
AND--

04:09.820 --> 04:11.251
YES, YES--

04:11.251 --> 04:12.883
AND THEN
I WOULD HOSE THEM DOWN.

04:12.883 --> 04:16.657
AND THEN I'D GET TO JUDGE
WHOSE BOOTY WAS THE BEST.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.759
(whispers)
BAR GOT SHUT DOWN FAST.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.031
OKAY, I SAY NO MORE WEARING
LIE SHIRTS.

04:21.031 --> 04:22.433
WHO'S WITH ME?

04:22.433 --> 04:24.295
(Ellie and Laurie) ME.

04:24.295 --> 04:26.266
IT'S WEIRD
YOU WOULDN'T SPEAK UP,

04:26.266 --> 04:29.470
CONSIDERING YOU'RE EATING
MY FOOD AND I GAVE YOU LIFE.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.771
MOVING SPEECH. I'M IN.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.503
YOU CAN'T JUST OUTLAW
MY SHIRT.

04:32.503 --> 04:33.804
YES, SHE CAN.

04:33.804 --> 04:35.676
IN OUR GANG OF SEVEN,
FOUR IS THE MAJORITY.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.908
WHO'S IN FAVOR OF FOUR VOTES
MAKING SOMETHING A RULE?

04:37.908 --> 04:39.350
(Travis, Jules, Ellie,
and Laurie) AYE.

04:39.350 --> 04:41.652
CHANGE APPROVED.
CHANGE YOUR SHIRT.

04:44.054 --> 04:48.719
SO I TEXTED HOT... DOG DOCTOR?

04:48.719 --> 04:50.321
(sighs)

04:50.321 --> 04:51.822
THANK YOU. AND I ASKED HER

04:51.822 --> 04:53.694
WHY SHE DIDN'T
WANT TO SEE ME AGAIN.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.396
WAS IT BECAUSE
YOU BURN SO BRIGHT

04:55.396 --> 04:57.398
THAT SHE KNEW SHE COULD NEVER
BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?

04:57.398 --> 04:59.470
NO. SHE SAID I HAD
HORRIBLE MANNERS.

04:59.470 --> 05:01.332
(chuckles) I MEAN,
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

05:01.332 --> 05:05.305
WELL, YOUR SHIRT DOES SEEM TO
COME OFF A LOT FOR NO REASON.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.077
(sniffs)
GOTTA AIR THE DOGS OUT.

05:07.077 --> 05:08.739
YOU SMELL LIKE A MAN.

05:08.739 --> 05:11.311
OH, I LOVE YOU GUYS,
BUT YOU'RE TOO NICE.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.984
NO, I NEED SOMEONE WHO'S GONNA
GIVE ME THE HARSH TRUTH,

05:13.984 --> 05:16.747
EVEN IF IT KILLS ME.

05:16.747 --> 05:19.850
(panting)
I'LL DO IT. I'LL DO IT.

05:19.850 --> 05:21.522
HOW DID YOU--

05:21.522 --> 05:23.554
(continues panting) YOUR PH--
YOUR PHONE WAS ON.

05:23.554 --> 05:24.895
OH.

05:24.895 --> 05:27.928
OH, THAT NECKLACE
IS SO "JERSEY SHORE."

05:27.928 --> 05:29.430
OH, YEAH.

05:31.902 --> 05:33.333
(both inhale sharply)

05:33.333 --> 05:36.006
HEY, NEIGHBOR.
DO YOU WANT SOME GRAPES?

05:36.006 --> 05:38.439
OH, NO, THANKS!
I DON'T LIKE GRAPES...

05:38.439 --> 05:39.710
ANYMORE. MM.

05:39.710 --> 05:41.912
(whimpers)

05:41.912 --> 05:43.614
(sighs)

05:43.614 --> 05:47.117
YOU KNOW, SHE'S, LIKE,
THIS PERKY, HOT BLONDE,

05:47.117 --> 05:49.680
AND TOM IS...

05:49.680 --> 05:51.522
OOH.

05:51.522 --> 05:52.723
HE'S...

05:52.723 --> 05:53.954
NONTRADITIONAL LOOKING?

05:53.954 --> 05:55.786
YOU ARE SO SWEET.

05:55.786 --> 05:57.057
(chuckles)
YOU KNOW,

05:57.057 --> 05:59.430
TOM HAS ALL THAT
DOCTOR MONEY.

05:59.430 --> 06:01.862
I THINK JESSICA'S
A GOLD DIGGER.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.935
I SHOULD KNOW. I WROTE
THE BOOK ON GOLD DIGGING.

06:04.935 --> 06:06.567
I SAY WE INVESTIGATE

06:06.567 --> 06:08.699
AND FIND OUT
WHAT THAT BITCH'S DEAL IS.

06:08.699 --> 06:12.142
NO, I'M HAPPY FOR TOM.
WE'RE NOT INVESTIGATING ANYONE.

06:12.142 --> 06:13.644
OH, HEY, SLUTS.

06:13.644 --> 06:16.006
OH...
SAY WHAT?

06:16.006 --> 06:18.779
IS THIS THE WINDOW
YOU MAKE TOMMY STAND OUTSIDE OF?

06:18.779 --> 06:20.751
WELL, THAT CRAP IS OVER.

06:20.751 --> 06:22.453
SO NO MORE KISSING YOUR ASS

06:22.453 --> 06:24.084
AND LAUGHING
AT YOUR LITTLE JOKES

06:24.084 --> 06:26.817
AND TAKING DIRTY NAPS
UP IN YOUR BED WHEN YOU'RE GONE.

06:26.817 --> 06:28.489
I WASN'T AWARE
HE DID THAT.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.921
JUST BACK THE HELL OFF.

06:30.921 --> 06:32.122
(bang)

06:33.994 --> 06:37.828
LET'S INVESTIGATE AND FIND OUT
WHAT THAT BITCH'S DEAL IS.

06:37.828 --> 06:39.470
MEET YOU BACK HERE
IN FIVE.

06:41.071 --> 06:42.473
OH, I'M LOVING THIS!

06:42.473 --> 06:43.834
IT'S GREAT.

06:47.538 --> 06:48.809
OOH, DAMN, GIRL!

06:48.809 --> 06:50.641
WHERE'D YOU GET
THAT BODY FROM?

06:50.641 --> 06:53.413
DO I REALLY HAVE TO SAY THAT
EVERY TIME YOU WALK INTO A ROOM?

06:53.413 --> 06:55.115
FOUR VOTES, DUDE.
DEAL WITH IT.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.587
(Laurie) OKAY.

06:56.587 --> 06:57.848
TOM AND JESSICA
JUST DROVE INTO TOWN.

06:57.848 --> 06:59.189
ARE YOU READY
TO GO SPY ON THEM?

06:59.189 --> 07:00.751
I GOT MY COMFY SHOES
AND I GOT THE WINE.

07:00.751 --> 07:02.022
OH, HONEY, ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANNA BRING WINE?

07:02.022 --> 07:03.423
WE'RE GONNA BE STANDING
IN ONE PLACE

07:03.423 --> 07:05.095
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

07:05.095 --> 07:06.697
SO WHAT? IF I HAVE TO PEE,
I'LL JUST SQUAT IN THE ALLEY.

07:06.697 --> 07:07.898
(laughs) GOOD IDEA.

07:07.898 --> 07:09.560
(hums)

07:09.560 --> 07:11.101
OH, HELL, YEAH, BABY!

07:11.101 --> 07:12.903
STUPID RULE.

07:12.903 --> 07:15.165
(gasps) COMFY SHOES, WINE--
ARE THOSE CAPER SUPPLIES?

07:15.165 --> 07:16.837
IS THIS A CAPER?

07:16.837 --> 07:19.069
WHENEVER THESE TWO GO ON
ONE OF THEIR ADVENTURES

07:19.069 --> 07:21.772
WITHOUT ADULT SUPERVISION,
IT'S ALWAYS A DISASTER.

07:21.772 --> 07:23.714
SHE'S THE FIRE STARTER.
SHE'S THE GASOLINE POURER.

07:23.714 --> 07:24.915
(both) BING.

07:24.915 --> 07:26.517
IT'S A BAD THING.

07:26.517 --> 07:27.918
REMEMBER THE TIME
WHEN WE LIVED OUT

07:27.918 --> 07:29.550
ALL OF OUR FAVORITE
SONG LYRICS?

07:29.550 --> 07:31.582
OH, YEAH.
WE WERE DANCING IN THE DARK.

07:31.582 --> 07:33.524
OH, WE DRANK PIГ‘A COLADAS,

07:33.524 --> 07:35.986
THEN WE LET
ALL THOSE DOGS OUT.
OH.

07:35.986 --> 07:38.188
AND I'M THE ONE THAT HAS TO
CLEAN UP THE MESS.

07:38.188 --> 07:39.930
WRITE THIS DOWN.

07:39.930 --> 07:42.793
DO NOT LET THESE TWO
NEAR ANY STATUES OF NAKED MEN.

07:42.793 --> 07:45.866
THAT EXPLAINS THAT BAG OF
BRONZE PENISES IN YOUR CLOSET.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.898
IF YOU SAY SO, YEAH.

07:47.898 --> 07:50.140
(high-pitched voice) READY.
BYE.

07:50.140 --> 07:52.903
I LOVE THIS PLACE.
THEY'VE GOT BIG ASS-BURGERS.

07:52.903 --> 07:54.104
NOPE.

07:54.104 --> 07:56.907
THEY'VE GOT BIG ASS BURGERS?

07:56.907 --> 07:58.478
THAT'S MUCH BETTER.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.850
HEY, THANKS FOR COMING
ON THIS FAKE DATE

07:59.850 --> 08:01.912
AND HELPING ME WITH MY MANNERS,
E-BISCUIT.

08:01.912 --> 08:04.114
ARE YOU KIDDING? IT COMBINES
TWO OF MY FAVORITE THINGS--

08:04.114 --> 08:06.156
EATING OUT AND TELLING PEOPLE
THEY'RE GROSS.

08:06.156 --> 08:10.220
NOW ARE YOU AT ALL CURIOUS
AS TO WHY I AM STILL STANDING?

08:10.220 --> 08:11.892
I AM NOT.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.624
YOU ALWAYS PULL A DATE'S
CHAIR OUT WHEN SHE SITS.

08:13.624 --> 08:16.827
OPEN UP WITH A PRACTICAL JOKE.
I LIKE IT!

08:16.827 --> 08:18.228
IT'S FOR REAL.

08:18.228 --> 08:19.770
HUH?
(snaps fingers)

08:19.770 --> 08:21.001
ALL RIGHT.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.773
THERE YOU GO.

08:22.773 --> 08:24.835
AND ALWAYS STAND WHEN A WOMAN
APPROACHES THE TABLE.

08:24.835 --> 08:29.580
OH, THAT'S THE OPPOSITE THING
THEY SAY AT MOST STRIP CLUBS.

08:29.580 --> 08:31.241
WHAT'S HE DOING?

08:31.241 --> 08:32.983
HE'S WASHING
HIS FOOD-PUSHING PINKIE.

08:32.983 --> 08:35.285
YEAH, IT'S FOR THE STUFF
I PUSH ONTO MY FORK.

08:35.285 --> 08:36.917
I'M NOT AN ANIMAL.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.248
GOOD GOD.

08:38.248 --> 08:40.190
NOT FOR WAITRESSES.

08:42.993 --> 08:46.196
(door closes)
THESE RULES
ARE OUT OF CONTROL, OKAY?

08:46.196 --> 08:49.129
I HAVE TO PUT A PAPER TOWEL
DOWN IN THE TOILET

08:49.129 --> 08:50.701
BEFORE I USE THE BATHROOM

08:50.701 --> 08:53.133
BECAUSE APPARENTLY,
I PEE TOO LOUD.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.905
I HAVE THE STREAM
OF A 20-YEAR-OLD.

08:54.905 --> 08:57.007
I WILL NOT APOLOGIZE
FOR THAT.

08:57.007 --> 08:58.569
WHAT'S WITH
THE TINY SPOON?

08:58.569 --> 08:59.970
ELLIE GOT FOUR VOTES.

08:59.970 --> 09:02.112
SHE THINKS THIS WILL
SLOW DOWN MY EATING.

09:02.112 --> 09:04.645
YOU CAN EITHER SIT THERE
WITH YOUR BABY SPOON

09:04.645 --> 09:06.877
OR YOU CAN STAND BESIDE ME
AND FIGHT.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.622
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:11.622 --> 09:13.624
BOBBY AND I ALWAYS
SEAL THE DEAL WITH A HUG PACT.

09:13.624 --> 09:14.825
YEAH, NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

09:14.825 --> 09:16.156
LOOK, WE HAVE
YOU, ME, AND BOBBY.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.989
ALL WE NEED IS TRAVIS' VOTE.
(chuckles)

09:18.989 --> 09:20.791
(cell phone beeping)

09:20.791 --> 09:22.893
MM.

09:22.893 --> 09:25.295
THE PACT IS SEALED.

09:25.295 --> 09:26.697
(cell phone rings)

09:26.697 --> 09:28.198
GO FOR TRAV-TASTIC.

09:28.198 --> 09:30.601
YEAH, I REALLY ANSWER
THE PHONE LIKE THAT. WHAT?

09:30.601 --> 09:32.172
(clinks)

09:32.172 --> 09:34.574
(both) в™Є BALCONY CAN в™Є

09:34.574 --> 09:36.977
(Jules) OH, I JUST LOVE
WATCHING BOBBY AND ELLIE

09:36.977 --> 09:38.178
ON THEIR PRETEND DATE.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.110
THEY'RE SO CUTE TOGETHER.

09:40.110 --> 09:42.753
YOU THINK ELLIE AND ANDY
ARE, LIKE, FOR REAL?

09:42.753 --> 09:44.655
N-NO, OF COURSE NOT.

09:44.655 --> 09:46.256
I'M JUST SO BORED
WATCHING TOM AND JESSICA.

09:46.256 --> 09:47.758
THEY'RE JUST SHOPPING.

09:47.758 --> 09:49.990
TO THE UNTRAINED EYE,

09:49.990 --> 09:52.723
BUT TO SOMEONE WITH A DEGREE
IN GOLD DIGGERY,

09:52.723 --> 09:55.595
I NOTICE THAT SHE DOESN'T
HAVE HER PURSE WITH HER.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.768
OH, MY GOD.
HE'S BUYING HER EVERYTHING.

09:57.768 --> 09:58.999
MM-HMM.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.631
OH, SURE,
SHE BENDS OVER,

10:00.631 --> 10:02.232
SHOWS HIM
FRANKLIN AND BASH,

10:02.232 --> 10:05.676
AND OUT COMES THE GOLD CARD.

10:05.676 --> 10:08.308
SHE'S GOOD.
YEAH, SHE'S REAL GOOD.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.840
JULES?

10:09.840 --> 10:11.642
KISS HER, BOBBY. KISS HER.

10:11.642 --> 10:13.313
JULES.
I'M BACK.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.717
YOU KNOW, I'D LIKE TO GET
A LOOK INSIDE THAT GIANT PURSE.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.949
I BET SHE HAS
HER WHOLE LIFE IN THERE.

10:18.949 --> 10:22.092
I BET THAT PURSE
IS AT TOM'S HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

10:22.092 --> 10:23.924
(gasps) YES!
YES! NO.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.997
SOMETIMES WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER,
IT'S LIKE I BLINK,

10:26.997 --> 10:30.931
AND SUDDENLY THINGS ARE
TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL.

10:30.931 --> 10:34.134
THERE. WE'RE IN.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.036
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS.

10:36.036 --> 10:39.970
WOW. TOM'S PLACE IS AMAZING.

10:39.970 --> 10:41.742
I COULD TOTALLY SEE MYSELF

10:41.742 --> 10:44.975
DOING A GUY I'M NOT ATTRACTED TO
IN THIS HOUSE.

10:44.975 --> 10:46.877
JUST FIND THE DAMN PURSE.

10:46.877 --> 10:50.020
JULES, NOW I KNOW
WHAT "DIRTY NAPS" MEANS.

10:50.020 --> 10:51.221
WHAT?

10:51.221 --> 10:52.422
(both) OH!
(glass shatters)

10:52.422 --> 10:54.825
ARE YOU KIDDING?
ARE YOU KIDDING?

10:54.825 --> 10:56.887
HEY, YOU STILL HAVE A KID?

10:56.887 --> 10:58.989
YEAH, YEAH, THAT PICTURE
IS FROM HER CHRISTENING.
(door opens and closes)

10:58.989 --> 11:01.962
I NEED A FRAME.
(shatters)

11:01.962 --> 11:03.293
HEY, YOU'RE WEARING
YOUR LIE SHIRT.

11:03.293 --> 11:05.135
WE HAVE RULES.

11:05.135 --> 11:07.067
NO, WE HAVE RULES.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.999
HIT IT, SIDEKICK.

11:08.999 --> 11:11.772
"LIE SHIRTS, BIG SPOONS,
AND LOUD URINATION

11:11.772 --> 11:13.704
"ARE ALL BACK.

11:13.704 --> 11:16.146
COASTERS ARE NOW OPTIONAL,
'CAUSE THEY'RE STUPID."

11:16.146 --> 11:17.347
DUMB.

11:17.347 --> 11:19.179
"AND THAT IS NOW
THE BEER FRIDGE."

11:23.183 --> 11:25.285
(bottles clink)
(gasps)

11:25.285 --> 11:27.057
(imitates Ellie)
CHANGE APPROVED!

11:27.057 --> 11:29.890
(bottles clink)
HOW'D YOU GET FOUR VOTES?

11:29.890 --> 11:33.193
YOU TURNED MY SON AGAINST ME,
DIDN'T YA?

11:33.193 --> 11:35.265
AND YOU RAISED SUCH A NERD,
ALL IT TOOK WAS A PAIR OF...

11:35.265 --> 11:37.067
(imitates nasal voice)
INCREDIBLE HULK HANDS.

11:37.067 --> 11:38.428
INCREDIBLE WHAT?

11:38.428 --> 11:41.802
(imitating The Incredible Hulk)
HULK ANGRY.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.174
HULK SMASH PANINI.
(growls)

11:44.174 --> 11:46.076
(laughs)

11:46.076 --> 11:48.008
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN A BOY IS RAISED

11:48.008 --> 11:49.910
BY CAPTAIN CAVEMAN.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.812
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:51.812 --> 11:55.315
THE FIRST BITE OF SOMEONE ELSE'S
DESSERT IS ALWAYS THE BEST.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.847
GIVE HIM A BREAK.

11:56.847 --> 11:58.749
SHARING FOOD WITH YOUR DATE
IS SWEET.

11:58.749 --> 11:59.950
I GUESS.

11:59.950 --> 12:01.391
I DID WANT TO TRY THE FLAN.

12:01.391 --> 12:02.993
(slap)
(mouth full) BACK OFF, GIRL.

12:02.993 --> 12:04.494
I JUST TOLD YOU
THE FIRST BITE'S THE BEST.

12:04.494 --> 12:06.226
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
YOU WEREN'T PLAYING DEFENSE.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.798
THAT IS IT!

12:07.798 --> 12:09.900
SO FAR YOU'VE EATEN
OFF MY PLATE,

12:09.900 --> 12:12.032
PICKED YOUR TEETH
WITH A KNIFE,

12:12.032 --> 12:14.134
AND USED YOUR PANTS, SHIRT,
AND TABLECLOTH AS A NAPKIN.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.906
THE ONLY TIME
THAT YOU'VE SAID "EXCUSE ME"

12:15.906 --> 12:18.909
WAS TO GET MY ATTENTION
BEFORE YOU BURPED.

12:18.909 --> 12:20.140
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO MISS IT.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.341
THAT BABY
WAS A TABLE SHAKER.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.473
THAT GUY CLAPPED.
HEY, BABY.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.376
YOU'RE HOPELESS.

12:26.376 --> 12:28.018
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET
THAT SECOND DATE,

12:28.018 --> 12:29.319
SO AS SOON
AS YOU CAN ACCEPT THAT,

12:29.319 --> 12:32.953
YOUR LIFE'S GONNA BE EASIER.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.184
(imitates The Incredible Hulk)
WOMEN--

12:34.184 --> 12:36.426
NO LIVE WITH THEM,

12:36.426 --> 12:38.488
NO SMASH.

12:40.090 --> 12:41.761
SORRY.

12:42.893 --> 12:44.895
I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE.

12:44.895 --> 12:46.797
WHERE DO YOU HIDE
A PURSE THAT BIG?

12:46.797 --> 12:48.098
MAYBE WE'RE INSIDE IT.

12:48.098 --> 12:49.299
(gasps)

12:49.299 --> 12:51.471
THIS IS CRAZY.
WE COULD GO TO JAIL.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.873
JAIL ISN'T THAT SCARY,

12:52.873 --> 12:54.344
ESPECIALLY SINCE CRAZY CHRIS

12:54.344 --> 12:57.147
TAUGHT US HOW TO MAKE NICE
WITH THE LATIN KINGS.

12:57.147 --> 13:00.080
I CAN'T REMEMBER THAT HANDSHAKE.
IT HAD, LIKE, 18 MOVES.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.312
IT'S SO SIMPLE.

13:02.312 --> 13:03.513
HAND, PUMP.

13:03.513 --> 13:04.915
HAND, PUMP.

13:04.915 --> 13:06.116
GIVE ONE UP.
ONE UP.

13:06.116 --> 13:07.317
POUR SOME OUT.
(door opens)

13:07.317 --> 13:08.518
FAKE SHAKE.
OH...

13:08.518 --> 13:10.060
(both) HOMIE HUG.

13:10.060 --> 13:11.421
SEE HERE?
(door closes)

13:11.421 --> 13:12.823
UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN TOMMY'S HOUSE

13:12.823 --> 13:14.224
DOING A LATIN KINGS SHAKE?

13:14.224 --> 13:16.196
UM, I CAN ANSWER THAT.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.168
LAURIE, BLIND HER
WITH YOUR WINE.

13:18.168 --> 13:19.369
GYAH!

13:20.901 --> 13:22.372
IT WAS MOSTLY EMPTY.

13:22.372 --> 13:24.234
YOU'VE RUINED MY BEST DRESS.

13:24.234 --> 13:26.006
I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.838
THAT'S YOUR BEST DRESS?

13:27.838 --> 13:30.981
I'M CALLING THE POLICE--
(whispers) THE FASHION POLICE.

13:30.981 --> 13:33.844
(Laurie and Jules laugh)
I'M CALLING TOMMY.

13:33.844 --> 13:37.117
NO, NO, PLEASE DON'T DO THAT.
WE CAN WORK THIS OUT. PLEASE.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.389
(cell phone rings)

13:39.389 --> 13:41.151
HOW'S IT GOING
WITH YOU AND JELLY?

13:41.151 --> 13:43.123
ARE YOU KEEPING IT
UNDER CONTROL?

13:43.123 --> 13:45.255
WE MAY HAVE TAKEN
A HOSTAGE.

13:45.255 --> 13:47.597
(banging on door)
(Jessica) YOU'RE GOING DOWN,
YOU LITTLE WHORES!

13:47.597 --> 13:50.030
(banging continues)
BYE.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.236
(banging on door)
(Jessica) LET ME OUT, YOU BITCH!

13:56.236 --> 13:57.968
YOU KNOW, NICE LANGUAGE!

13:57.968 --> 14:00.270
LADY, YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT
YOUR BATHROOM BUCKET.

14:00.270 --> 14:02.372
I CALLED IN THE CLEANER.
LET ME OUT, YOU SKANK!

14:02.372 --> 14:04.414
I HAD TO.

14:09.319 --> 14:11.521
I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A, UH,
FELONY BREAK IN

14:11.521 --> 14:14.054
AND A BODY IN THE CLOSET.
IS THAT CORRECT?

14:14.054 --> 14:15.625
ALL RIGHT.

14:15.625 --> 14:17.027
DO WHAT I SAY,
AND WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS.

14:17.027 --> 14:18.488
JELLY BEAN,
FIND THAT DAMN PURSE.

14:18.488 --> 14:20.530
WE CAN STILL PROVE
SHE'S A GOLD DIGGER.

14:20.530 --> 14:23.593
JULES, GET A RAG,
WIPE THE PLACE DOWN--

14:23.593 --> 14:25.395
TABLES, DOOR KNOBS,
ANYTHING YOU MAY HAVE TOUCHED.

14:25.395 --> 14:26.636
GET TO WORK.

14:26.636 --> 14:28.468
A "PLEASE" WOULD BE NICE.

14:28.468 --> 14:29.869
COME AGAIN?

14:29.869 --> 14:31.641
I SAID A "PLEASE"
WOULD BE NICE.

14:31.641 --> 14:33.974
GET IT STRAIGHT, BUSTER.
I'M NOT HERE TO SAY "PLEASE."

14:33.974 --> 14:36.146
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO.

14:36.146 --> 14:39.509
IF MY HELP'S NOT APPRECIATED,
BEST OF LUCK, LADY.

14:39.509 --> 14:41.451
NO, NO.
I-I'M SORRY, MISS ELLIE.

14:41.451 --> 14:43.914
(Jessica)
ARE YOU GUYS GONNA KILL ME?

14:45.115 --> 14:46.316
NO.

14:46.316 --> 14:47.988
JESSICA, THAT TEXT YOU SENT

14:47.988 --> 14:50.660
AUTOCORRECTED TO THE WORD
"KIDNAPPED." (laughs)

14:50.660 --> 14:52.362
CLEANER OUT.

14:52.362 --> 14:53.893
HEY!

14:58.228 --> 15:00.500
(door closes)

15:00.500 --> 15:02.402
WHOA. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

15:02.402 --> 15:04.104
THINK YOU CAN JUST
CRUSH MY DAD AND WALK AWAY?

15:04.104 --> 15:05.575
WELL, BAD NEWS, LADY.

15:05.575 --> 15:09.379
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO ANSWER
TO... THIS GUY.

15:09.379 --> 15:13.013
DID YOU FINALLY GET VISITED
BY THE NUT SACK FAIRY?

15:13.013 --> 15:15.245
I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU.
WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER HERE
AND SAY THAT?

15:15.245 --> 15:16.987
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO.

15:16.987 --> 15:20.150
ALL YOU DUMMIES TREAT BOBBY
WITH SUCH KID GLOVES.

15:20.150 --> 15:21.521
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE
SO MUCH BETTER

15:21.521 --> 15:24.024
IF WE WERE ALL
JUST MEAN AND HATEFUL.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.555
I LOVE YOUR DAD.

15:25.555 --> 15:27.557
HE WANTS A NICE, CLASSY WOMAN
TO SPEND HIS LIFE WITH.

15:27.557 --> 15:30.000
TRAV, HE'S AN UNEMPLOYED GUY

15:30.000 --> 15:32.462
WHO LIVES ON A BOAT
IN A PARKING LOT.

15:32.462 --> 15:34.304
IF EVERY OTHER ASPECT
OF HIS PERSONALITY

15:34.304 --> 15:36.036
ISN'T TOP NOTCH,

15:36.036 --> 15:38.008
DO YOU THINK HE'S REALLY
GONNA FIND THAT WOMAN?

15:38.008 --> 15:41.341
DO YOU THINK HE'LL EVER
REALLY BE HAPPY?!

15:41.341 --> 15:43.643
NO, I DON'T!

15:50.250 --> 15:52.152
WAS HE REALLY CRUSHED?

15:52.152 --> 15:53.353
YEAH.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.455
SHOOT.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.257
THIS PSYCHO
LOCKED ME IN THE CLOSET

15:57.257 --> 15:58.688
AND TIED MY HANDS.

15:58.688 --> 16:00.360
WHOA. DON'T PUSH ME!

16:00.360 --> 16:02.532
OH! OH!
O-OKAY. STOP. STOP.

16:02.532 --> 16:05.065
NORMALLY I'D BE THRILLED TO HAVE
TWO GALS FIGHTING IN MY HOUSE.

16:05.065 --> 16:08.698
MOST OF MY CUL-DE-SAC
FAN FICTION STARTS LIKE THIS.

16:08.698 --> 16:11.601
WELL, NO ONE GETS HOG-TIED
AND THROWN IN THE CLOSET, RIGHT?

16:11.601 --> 16:13.403
(chuckles)

16:13.403 --> 16:15.075
I SHOULD NEVER READ
THAT STUFF, SHOULD I?

16:15.075 --> 16:16.276
(whispers) NO.

16:16.276 --> 16:17.647
WE WERE JUST WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

16:17.647 --> 16:21.081
AND JESSICA WAS SO INTO YOU
SO QUICKLY THAT--

16:21.081 --> 16:24.014
RIGHT, 'CAUSE A-A WOMAN COULD
NEVER FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT ME.

16:24.014 --> 16:26.756
YOU SHOULD GO.

16:26.756 --> 16:28.488
BYE-BYE, JESSICA.
(chuckles)

16:28.488 --> 16:30.990
DON'T LET THE DOOR HIT YA
IN YOUR GOLD-DIGGING ASS.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.622
NO, JULES. UH, YOU.

16:32.622 --> 16:34.024
WHAT?

16:34.024 --> 16:35.725
JULES! I FOUND IT.

16:35.725 --> 16:37.227
I WALKED PAST IT FOUR TIMES.

16:37.227 --> 16:38.498
I THOUGHT
IT WAS A BEANBAG CHAIR.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.699
GIVE ME THAT!

16:39.699 --> 16:41.101
NO. OH!
AAH!

16:41.101 --> 16:42.532
ALL RIGHT.

16:42.532 --> 16:44.474
PURSE OF A PURSE.

16:44.474 --> 16:45.675
(gasps)

16:45.675 --> 16:48.538
YES.
THIS IS YOUR WATCH, TOM.

16:48.538 --> 16:50.110
WHAT?

16:50.110 --> 16:53.413
WHY WOULD YOUR WATCH
BE IN HER PURSE, TOM?

16:53.413 --> 16:56.086
SHE'S GETTING IT FIXED FOR ME.

16:56.086 --> 16:57.587
I GUESS WE SHOULD GO.

17:02.652 --> 17:04.354
THEY HURT ME.
(door opens)

17:04.354 --> 17:07.227
OKAY.
(door closes)

17:07.227 --> 17:10.330
UGH. I FEEL HORRIBLE--

17:10.330 --> 17:12.162
PARTLY BECAUSE OF TOM,

17:12.162 --> 17:15.635
PARTLY BECAUSE I HAD
THREE SLICES OF CHOCOLATE CAKE

17:15.635 --> 17:19.109
AND THEN AN ACTUAL SLICE
OF CHOCOLATE CAKE.

17:19.109 --> 17:21.211
I HAD A WHOLE BOTTLE
OF CHOCOLATE CAKE.

17:21.211 --> 17:22.672
OH.

17:22.672 --> 17:26.446
HEY, GUYS, DO YOU THINK
WE WENT TOO FAR WITH TOM?

17:26.446 --> 17:28.248
SORRY. NEW RULE.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.449
SHALL WE?
MM.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.221
WE...
AS HUSBANDS...

17:31.221 --> 17:34.084
(both) NO LONGER HAVE TO RESPOND
TO CRAZY-ASS QUESTIONS

17:34.084 --> 17:37.157
THAT YOU'D GET MAD AT US
FOR ANSWERING HONESTLY,

17:37.157 --> 17:39.289
EVEN THOUGH, DEEP DOWN,

17:39.289 --> 17:42.061
YOU ALREADY KNOW
THE HONEST ANSWER.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.534
THAT WAS ACTUALLY
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

17:46.436 --> 17:49.299
OKAY, DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
JUST LET ME TALK.

17:49.299 --> 17:50.670
EVEN THOUGH I MEAN WELL,

17:50.670 --> 17:52.572
I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES
I CAN BE A LITTLE--

17:52.572 --> 17:54.404
OH, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE.

17:54.404 --> 17:56.776
I'M ONLY STANDING BECAUSE
THERE'S A LADY PRESENT.

18:00.410 --> 18:02.182
THANK YOU.

18:03.653 --> 18:06.085
(clears throat)

18:06.085 --> 18:09.719
TRAVIS TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE
JUST LOOKING OUT FOR ME.

18:09.719 --> 18:12.562
YOU KNOW
I'M PRETTY DAMN CHARMIN'.

18:12.562 --> 18:15.695
YOU'D TOTALLY GO OUT WITH ME
ON A SECOND DATE.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.367
I KNOW.

18:17.367 --> 18:18.568
в™Єв™Єв™Є

18:18.568 --> 18:20.230
ARE YOUR HANDS CLEAN?

18:20.230 --> 18:23.303
NOPE. (laughs)

18:24.834 --> 18:26.736
THERE YOU ARE.

18:26.736 --> 18:28.608
I TRIED CALLING.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.481
CAN YOU STOP
BREAKING INTO MY HOUSE?

18:31.481 --> 18:32.742
YOU BROKE INTO MY HOUSE.

18:32.742 --> 18:34.344
THAT'S DIFFERENT.
I HAVE KEYS.

18:34.344 --> 18:35.885
I NEVER GAVE YOU
A SET OF KEYS.

18:35.885 --> 18:38.448
I-I STOLE 'EM
FOR EMERGENCIES.

18:38.448 --> 18:39.889
(thud overhead)

18:39.889 --> 18:41.551
OH, UM, I WASN'T SURE
I'D GET IN THE WINDOW,

18:41.551 --> 18:43.223
SO THAT'S LAURIE
ON THE ROOF.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.595
(thuds)
(Laurie) AAH!

18:45.595 --> 18:47.727
IN HEELS.
OH.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.900
(footsteps approach)
LISTEN, UM, WE WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE.

18:50.900 --> 18:52.562
(panting) OH.

18:52.562 --> 18:54.664
ALMOST DIED.

18:54.664 --> 18:56.706
THIS SAVED ME.

18:56.706 --> 18:58.738
THANK YOU.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.170
(crash)

19:00.170 --> 19:01.841
в™Єв™Єв™Є

19:01.841 --> 19:03.443
WHERE'S JESSICA?

19:03.443 --> 19:04.874
I KICKED HER OUT.

19:04.874 --> 19:07.247
SHE WAS STEALING MY WATCH.

19:07.247 --> 19:10.620
I WAS... JUST TOO EMBARRASSED
TO ADMIT IT.

19:10.620 --> 19:12.382
I KNEW WE WERE RIGHT!

19:12.382 --> 19:14.824
DUDE!
(grunting)

19:14.824 --> 19:17.657
в™Єв™Єв™Є

19:17.657 --> 19:18.928
HOMIE HUG.

19:18.928 --> 19:20.630
LATIN KINGS, HUH?

19:20.630 --> 19:22.532
HOW DOES EVERYONE
KNOW THAT?

19:22.532 --> 19:24.694
STILL, I-IT WAS NICE HAVING
SOMEONE PAY ATTENTION TO ME,

19:24.694 --> 19:26.896
EVEN IF IT WASN'T REAL.

19:26.896 --> 19:29.239
I GET LONELY SOMETIMES.

19:29.239 --> 19:30.440
(sighs)

19:30.440 --> 19:31.801
I AM SO SORRY.

19:31.801 --> 19:33.443
IT'S OKAY.

19:33.443 --> 19:35.675
IT SEEMED LIKE YOU WERE
ALMOST LOOKING OUT FOR ME.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.407
WELL,
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS DO.

19:37.407 --> 19:39.509
WE LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER.

19:39.509 --> 19:40.910

в™Є SHE'S INCREDIBLE в™Є

19:40.910 --> 19:42.882
I HOPE YOU FIND
SOME FRIENDS.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.215
TAKE CARE.

19:45.215 --> 19:46.786
OH, TOM, WE'RE JUST KIDDING.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.558
COME ON!

19:48.558 --> 19:51.361
в™Є BUT SHE REPLIED в™Є

19:51.361 --> 19:53.223
HEY, EVERYONE.

19:55.625 --> 19:56.896
MM-HMM.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.628
OH, THIS IS EASILY
THE GREATEST THING

19:58.628 --> 20:00.370
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

20:00.370 --> 20:02.632
WELL, THAT MAKES ME
A LITTLE SAD.

20:02.632 --> 20:04.474
WHY DO I HAVE TO
STAND OUT HERE?

20:04.474 --> 20:06.906
IT'S YOUR PUNISHMENT
FOR TURNING TRAV AGAINST ME.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.509
THANK GOD ANDY FLIPPED BACK.

20:09.509 --> 20:10.780
WE HAD A HUG PACT.

20:10.780 --> 20:11.981

20:11.981 --> 20:13.783

20:13.783 --> 20:17.317
THIS IS SO FUN. I-I FEEL LIKE
I'M ONE OF YOU GUYS.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.788
WELL, YOU ARE.

20:18.788 --> 20:20.650

OH, STOP IT.

20:48.378 --> 20:50.750
