23:58.838 --> 24:00.139
have reestablished
our dynamic.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.674
So you're out of
the gang life now?

24:01.708 --> 24:02.809
You done with that?

24:02.842 --> 24:05.344
The feds put most of
the power players in jail,

24:05.377 --> 24:07.413
so there's not much
of a gang left.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.682
So, why was your cousin
wearing a wire anyway?

24:09.716 --> 24:12.318
Jake was in trouble with the FDA
'cause of some bad produce,

24:12.351 --> 24:14.020
so Jimmy struck a deal
with the DEA

24:14.053 --> 24:16.422
because of the drug element
hanging around the store.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.991
It's standard
joint-task-force stuff.

24:19.025 --> 24:21.027
Has nobody here
seen "The Wire"?

24:21.060 --> 24:22.428
God!

24:22.461 --> 24:26.365
I have a feeling Jimmy's gonna
get what he deserves.
