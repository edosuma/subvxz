WEBVTT

00:06.740 --> 00:09.409
Today we're gonna
discuss the Civil War.

00:09.442 --> 00:13.313
  Miss Bliss,
  you said we were
  gonna see a movie.

00:13.346 --> 00:16.649
  Yeah, right.
  I did promise you a movie.

00:16.683 --> 00:21.321
  However, when the film
  arrived, it was in less than
  satisfactory condition.

00:23.223 --> 00:25.825
  Gee,
  that's too bad, Miss Bliss.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.228
  Now we can't
  study the Civil War.

00:28.261 --> 00:31.364
   And if we can't study it,
   why even be here?

00:31.398 --> 00:32.799
 Park it, Zack.

00:32.832 --> 00:35.301
 You know I
 always have a plan B.

00:37.270 --> 00:40.473
 Now,
 the Civil War was different.

00:40.507 --> 00:43.476
 Not only was this
 country torn in half,

00:43.510 --> 00:46.546
states and even
families were divided.

00:46.579 --> 00:49.549
   Father against son,
   brother against brother,

00:49.582 --> 00:52.485
 and in some cases,
 even mother against daughter.

00:52.519 --> 00:56.222
Big deal. Sounds
like an ordinary weekend
at my house.

00:58.358 --> 01:00.794
  I'll show you on this map,

01:00.827 --> 01:03.263
 exactly how the states split.

01:06.766 --> 01:08.835
   This is the south,

01:08.868 --> 01:11.471
and up there
somewhere is the north.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.075
( bell rings )

01:15.075 --> 01:18.178
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

01:18.211 --> 01:20.847
  <i>* I don't think I'll</i>
  <i>ever make it on time</i>

01:20.880 --> 01:23.850
  <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
  <i>and I give myself a look</i>

01:23.883 --> 01:27.454
 <i>* I'm at</i>
 <i>the corner just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

01:27.487 --> 01:31.391
   <i>* It's all right</i>
   <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

01:33.226 --> 01:36.196
   <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
   <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

01:36.229 --> 01:39.232
    <i>* And my dog ate</i>
    <i>all my homework last night</i>

01:39.265 --> 01:42.235
  <i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
  <i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

01:42.268 --> 01:45.739
 <i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>
 <i>it'll be all right</i>

01:45.772 --> 01:49.442
   <i>* It's all right</i>
   <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

02:03.890 --> 02:07.327
    <i>* It's all right</i>
    <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

02:07.360 --> 02:10.295
    <i>* It's all right</i>
    <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

02:10.330 --> 02:13.600
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

02:21.241 --> 02:23.076
 Carrie: <i>It's true what</i>
<i>they say about history.</i>

02:23.076 --> 02:27.881
<i>It really is a mirror to</i>
<i>the future and like clockwork,</i>
<i>always repeats itself.</i>

02:27.914 --> 02:30.950
<i>Every year, we ask Mr. Belding</i>
<i>for more supplies,</i>

02:30.984 --> 02:33.486
 <i>and every year,</i>
 <i>he gives us the same answer.</i>

02:33.520 --> 02:35.588
  No, no, no, definitely no.

02:35.622 --> 02:37.924
   The budget's
   been cut, you know.
   You just have to make do.

02:37.957 --> 02:40.260
  But my art students
  need acrylic paint.

02:40.293 --> 02:42.796
  Miss Paladrino,
  did Rembrandt
  use acrylic paint?

02:42.829 --> 02:45.265
  Did Van Gogh?
  Renoir? No.

02:45.298 --> 02:47.534
They made do
with what they had
and so can you.

02:47.567 --> 02:48.968
  But I have nothing?

02:49.002 --> 02:50.670
  Well, work with it.

02:53.506 --> 02:56.910
  Please, Mr.
  Belding, just read my list.

02:56.943 --> 03:00.246
 A globe, set of encyclopedias,
 VCR, field trip.

03:00.613 --> 03:02.248
 A field trip?

03:02.282 --> 03:05.518
  I want to take my
  students to the State House

03:05.552 --> 03:07.354
 to see our
 government in action.

03:07.387 --> 03:09.422
 I want to make
 American history come alive.

03:09.456 --> 03:12.792
  Leave it alone.
  History is much better
  when it's left in the past.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.828
 Care for a requisition form?

03:14.861 --> 03:18.498
  I've been filling
  out forms for years,
  nothing ever comes from it.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.966
  No.

03:20.066 --> 03:22.569
  As I recall, you received
  a very nice slide projector

03:22.602 --> 03:23.870
   three years ago.

03:23.903 --> 03:26.206
  I did and I appreciate it.

03:26.239 --> 03:30.243
   But there's a slide
   of you and Mrs. Belding
   at Club Med jammed in it.

03:30.276 --> 03:33.947
   Our students
   were very impressed
   you could limbo.

03:33.980 --> 03:36.816
 No.
 I'm sorry. My hands are tied.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.686
 I leave you with one word,
 requisition form.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.355
   That's two words.

03:45.592 --> 03:47.560
Miss Bliss, your mail.

03:49.996 --> 03:52.966
  Trumphill Academy?
  They got two of our
  teachers last year.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.237
   Well, they are not
   going to get Miss Bliss.

03:59.639 --> 04:01.474
 Good Morning.

04:02.642 --> 04:06.946
 Do any of you future
 scientist of America

04:07.047 --> 04:08.848
  know what day tomorrow is?

04:08.882 --> 04:10.350
   Tuesday!

04:10.383 --> 04:12.285
  Tomorrow is

04:12.585 --> 04:15.822
Dissection Day.

04:15.855 --> 04:19.426
   All right. I've been waiting
   for this day all my life.

04:19.459 --> 04:23.496
Yeah, it's party time.
We're gonna slice
those frogs to shreds.

04:24.330 --> 04:25.865
Class,

04:25.899 --> 04:30.303
  meet your specimen.

04:30.337 --> 04:31.604
 Please, I rather not.

04:31.638 --> 04:33.640
  Oh, my gosh, they're alive.

04:33.673 --> 04:36.443
  Only temporarily, my dear.

04:36.476 --> 04:37.577
   Assassin.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.714
  Lighten up,
  Nikki, they're only frogs.

04:40.747 --> 04:44.351
 If it makes you feel better,
 we'll give them a last meal.

04:44.384 --> 04:46.286
Screech,
let me have your flies.

04:46.319 --> 04:48.655
 No way,
 you're not getting my flies.

04:48.688 --> 04:50.090
 Now,

04:50.090 --> 04:51.891
 first thing tomorrow,

04:51.925 --> 04:55.095
   we'll expose the heart,
   the lungs
   and the kidneys.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.464
   Once we expose them,
   we'll remove them

04:57.497 --> 05:00.934
 and have some real
 hands-on experience.

05:01.401 --> 05:03.870
Any questions?

05:03.903 --> 05:06.539
Does everybody have
to do this assignment?

05:06.573 --> 05:10.510
   Why on earth would anyone
   not want to participate?

05:12.379 --> 05:14.514
  A word to the wise,

05:14.547 --> 05:18.518
white is not a good
color to wear tomorrow.

05:21.054 --> 05:25.058
 So Morton, have you filled out
 your requisition
 forms for the year yet?

05:25.091 --> 05:26.059
 Yes, I have.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.695
It's like pulling teeth
with the front office.

05:28.728 --> 05:30.463
  I rather enjoy it.

05:30.497 --> 05:31.431
   I don't.

05:31.464 --> 05:34.467
 My students are
 always getting short-changed.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.669
Oh, Miss Bliss.

05:35.702 --> 05:37.604
   Mr. Belding, is that you?

05:37.637 --> 05:38.972
   Surprise.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.974
 I give you the world.

05:42.375 --> 05:43.710
   What's the catch?

05:43.743 --> 05:45.245
   There's no catch.

05:45.278 --> 05:49.516
 A previous requisition of
 yours was filled. I told you,
 trust in the system.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.084
 Mr. Belding,

05:51.084 --> 05:54.621
 have you had any luck
 acquiring my lightning rods?

05:54.654 --> 05:57.457
Sorry, Morton,
the school board
turned you down again.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.492
  They don't believe
  reanimation of dead tissue

05:59.526 --> 06:01.428
   should be
   an eighth grade activity.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.031
Fools.

06:05.031 --> 06:08.435
 Miss Bliss, I want you to know
 that I'm in your corner.

06:08.468 --> 06:11.571
   Your fight is my fight
   and your need is my need.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.376
   -He was sincere.
   -He was generous.

06:16.409 --> 06:19.546
He was up to something.

06:19.579 --> 06:22.682
 Lisa, we need your opinion
 on the best way to
 approach a woman.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.452
  And since you're
  almost one of them,
  you'll do.

06:25.785 --> 06:27.687
Thanks.

06:27.721 --> 06:31.057
 I think the first thing you
 tell them is that you have
   a lot of money.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.392
 That's a good start.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.494
  No, no, no.

06:34.527 --> 06:37.097
  You open your heart
  and you tell them,

06:37.130 --> 06:40.600
   with sincerity,
   the biggest lie
   you can think of.

06:40.633 --> 06:43.470
  That'll work if
  it's the right lie.

06:44.571 --> 06:45.972
 You want my opinion?

06:46.072 --> 06:47.407
 -No.
 -No.

06:48.608 --> 06:49.676
  Sign this.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.544
  Sign what?

06:51.578 --> 06:53.480
"Down with Frogicide."

06:53.513 --> 06:54.581
 What is this?

06:54.614 --> 06:56.082
   It's my petition

06:56.116 --> 06:59.486
 to stop
 the senseless killing of frogs
 in science class.

06:59.519 --> 07:01.421
  Senseless?

07:01.454 --> 07:04.591
  Oh, I suppose it's okay
  to raise defenseless
  little frogs for slaughter?

07:04.624 --> 07:06.526
 Well, why else
 would you raise them?

07:06.559 --> 07:08.695
 To give people warts?

07:08.728 --> 07:11.064
 You don't think
 frogs have feelings?

07:11.097 --> 07:13.466
  What about Kermit?

07:13.500 --> 07:15.568
You toad,
you're talking puppets,

07:15.602 --> 07:17.537
  I'm talking Mother Nature.

07:17.570 --> 07:21.541
 I just think you are afraid of
 losing your lunch
 in the science lab.

07:21.574 --> 07:25.111
We're throwing our
whole ecological system
out of whack

07:25.145 --> 07:28.348
   by taking thousands of frogs
   out of the environment

07:28.381 --> 07:30.717
   and putting them
   in the classroom.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.487
   I thought I could
   count on you guys.

07:34.521 --> 07:36.456
 You can. We hear you.

07:36.489 --> 07:39.426
  Look, if you want to cut
  class, we'll cover for you,
  won't we, guys?

07:39.459 --> 07:40.527
   Sure, we'll lie for you.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.495
  Yeah. See.

07:42.529 --> 07:44.164
   You guys are disgusting.

07:44.197 --> 07:47.167
   I'm gonna see if
   Miss Bliss will help me.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.735
 Nikki, wait.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.771
 Can I have your frog?

07:58.511 --> 08:00.113
 -Mr. Morton, I...
 -Shh!

08:01.448 --> 08:04.651
   This is the crucial time.

08:11.591 --> 08:13.493
Cup o'noodles.

08:16.529 --> 08:19.666
 What can I do for you,
 Miss Bliss?

08:19.699 --> 08:22.469
  I wanna talk to you about
  one of your students,
  Nikki Coleman.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.137
  Nikki! Bright girl.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.072
 Yeah, she is.

08:26.106 --> 08:29.476
   She is also very upset
   about dissecting
   a frog tomorrow.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.744
  She'll get over it.

08:30.777 --> 08:33.446
   She has a very
   scientific mind.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.582
She also has
a very concerned heart

08:35.615 --> 08:37.583
 and an even deeper conscience.

08:37.616 --> 08:39.552
  My dear Miss Bliss,

08:39.586 --> 08:43.590
every year I have a student
who doesn't want
to open up a frog.

08:43.623 --> 08:48.094
   They're slimy, they're icky,
   they remind them
   of their Uncle Fred.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.530
 I've heard them all.

08:50.563 --> 08:53.800
  It's not so
  much the dissecting
  that bothers Nikki,

08:53.833 --> 08:57.070
 it's the killing of
 an innocent living creature.

08:57.103 --> 09:02.008
Miss Bliss,
I am not the heartless soul
you must think I am.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.744
-Oh, I...
-Let me finish, please.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.613
When I was a young man,

09:06.646 --> 09:11.751
  and my first science
  teacher brought out
  a cold, dead frog,

09:11.785 --> 09:16.656
   don't you think I had many
   of those same fears and
   concerns as Nikki?

09:17.624 --> 09:19.092
 No, I don't.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.728
 You're right.

09:21.761 --> 09:25.632
  I couldn't wait
  to split it open
  and view first-hand

09:25.665 --> 09:27.834
 the wonders of life.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.637
  Mr. Morton,

09:30.670 --> 09:35.508
 I really do respect
 your enthusiastic
 approach to science,

09:35.542 --> 09:39.446
 but is it absolutely necessary
 for Nikki to participate?

09:39.479 --> 09:42.716
If she wants to
pass this class, it is.

09:50.557 --> 09:52.625
Well, what did he say?

09:53.593 --> 09:54.894
 He won't excuse you.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.764
I'm not going to do it.

09:57.797 --> 10:01.768
   Nikki, tomorrow's assignment
   is part of your
   science requirement,

10:01.801 --> 10:04.237
   if you don't do it,
   you could fail the class.

10:04.270 --> 10:07.841
  I will not participate
  in any animal experiments,

10:07.874 --> 10:09.909
  even for the grade.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.879
  Miss Bliss, what would you do
  if you were me?

10:12.912 --> 10:14.881
  I would weigh
  the facts carefully

10:14.914 --> 10:17.951
   and think long and hard
   before I came to
   any conclusions.

10:18.718 --> 10:20.186
And then what?

10:21.254 --> 10:23.690
Then I would
listen to my conscience

10:23.723 --> 10:26.693
 and do what my
 heart said was right.

10:26.726 --> 10:27.894
  Thanks, Miss Bliss.

10:27.927 --> 10:29.829
You always know
the right thing to do.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.480
  Miss Bliss,

10:47.514 --> 10:50.050
just exactly what do
you mean when you say,

10:50.083 --> 10:53.520
  "Explain the significance
  of the Louisiana Purchase?"

10:55.055 --> 10:56.656
I mean,

10:56.690 --> 11:00.527
  explain
  the significance of the
  Louisiana Purchase.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.430
   Thanks for
   clearing that up for me.

11:03.463 --> 11:07.634
   Belding: <i>Miss Bliss,</i>
   <i>report to the principal's</i>
   <i>office immediately.</i>

11:08.668 --> 11:09.736
  All: Ooooh!

11:11.071 --> 11:13.073
  Miss Bliss,
  are you in trouble?

11:14.507 --> 11:16.376
   I don't think so.

11:16.409 --> 11:19.079
  Well, gee, I guess this means
  we can't take our tests.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.680
   Oh, yes, we can.

11:20.714 --> 11:23.383
 I'm putting you all
 on the honor system.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.952
 And, Zack, you're in charge.

11:25.985 --> 11:30.590
  Me? You can't do this,
  Miss Bliss.
  I don't even trust myself.

11:30.623 --> 11:33.360
Exactly.
That's why I chose you.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.996
  Would you come and sit
  at my desk and I'll be back
  as quick as I can.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.967
   What's
   the answer to number one?

11:41.001 --> 11:45.605
 Hey, hey,
 let's keep our roving eyes
 on our own paper,

11:45.638 --> 11:47.607
 Mr. Michael Gonzalez.

11:51.611 --> 11:55.515
   I hope it's her perfume
   you can't resist, Samuel.

11:56.816 --> 11:58.485
   Lighten up, Zack.

11:58.785 --> 12:02.088
Mikey. Talking.

12:02.122 --> 12:06.593
   Didn't we learn
   about you last week,
   Benedict Arnold?

12:06.626 --> 12:08.728
  Lisa. Name calling.

12:10.730 --> 12:11.798
( bell rings )

12:12.732 --> 12:13.967
 Hey.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.068
 Hey.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.770
 I didn't dismiss you.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.973
 I won't forget this.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.709
This is going on
your permanent record.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.782
Nikki.

12:28.815 --> 12:30.417
  What happened?
  Are you all right?

12:30.450 --> 12:32.552
 I caught her down
 by the football field

12:32.585 --> 12:35.689
 just after she
 released tomorrow's specimens.

12:35.722 --> 12:40.493
  Miss Bliss, it was beautiful.
  I freed the frogs
  just like you said.

12:40.527 --> 12:43.129
   Nikki, I never said anything
   about freeing the frogs.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.398
 But you said
 follow my conscience.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.134
   And my conscience said,
   "Free the frogs."

12:48.168 --> 12:51.137
   Miss Bliss,
   I am shocked and dismayed

12:51.171 --> 12:54.607
   that you are a party to
   this nefarious incident.

12:54.641 --> 12:55.742
  I was not.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.143
 Of course she wasn't.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.478
You weren't, were you?

12:58.511 --> 12:59.412
  No.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.715
 Nevertheless,
 now my teaching is disrupted

13:01.748 --> 13:05.952
 and my class will
 be unable to perform
 tomorrow's planned dissection.

13:06.052 --> 13:08.054
 Victory, Miss Bliss.

13:08.054 --> 13:11.624
 Mr.
 Belding, this is an outrage.

13:11.658 --> 13:15.428
 For every action there must be
 an equal and
 opposite reaction.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.464
What is the punishment?

13:17.897 --> 13:19.065
Nikki.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.935
   That wasn't nice.

13:22.702 --> 13:23.970
  Satisfied?

13:24.838 --> 13:26.806
  Satisfied?

13:26.840 --> 13:29.075
  A crime worthy of
  capital punishment

13:29.075 --> 13:33.480
 cannot be assuaged by a simple
 "That wasn't nice."

13:33.513 --> 13:34.948
 You're right.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.783
Nikki,

13:36.816 --> 13:38.084
  don't do it again.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.088
 Hope I wasn't too hard on her.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.624
 By the way, how's the globe?

13:47.093 --> 13:48.661
   Cretin.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.898
  That's it?

13:51.931 --> 13:53.967
  You were very lucky, Nikki.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.103
I try to make a statement
and nobody even cares.

14:02.108 --> 14:04.144
   My life is over.

14:05.578 --> 14:06.680
Again?

14:06.713 --> 14:08.615
  What did you do this time?

14:08.648 --> 14:11.751
  Last week, Belding said
  we could take
  a field trip to the ballet.

14:11.785 --> 14:14.821
  Now he wants us to
  listen to it on the radio.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.492
  Where do you want the VCR?

14:19.526 --> 14:21.561
 I don't know,
 I never expected to get one.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.663
 And Mr. Belding approved this?

14:23.697 --> 14:26.766
 Absolutely. And the entire set
 of <i>America at War.</i>

14:26.800 --> 14:28.768
They have one of
Little Bighorn.

14:28.802 --> 14:32.672
 There's even
 a post-game interview
 with General Custer.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.909
 Just kidding.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.645
  Well, gee, Carrie,

14:38.678 --> 14:40.980
  if I rent <i>Swan Lake</i>
  with my own money,

14:41.081 --> 14:43.950
  do you think maybe
  I could borrow your player?

14:43.983 --> 14:45.652
  Oh, stop it, Tina.

14:45.685 --> 14:48.588
   What do you have on Belding?
   Revealing photos?

14:48.621 --> 14:51.925
Tina, something is going on
and I intend to get
to the bottom of it,

14:51.958 --> 14:56.696
  and I will not,
  repeat, not accept
  anymore special treatment.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.699
   Here's the set
   of encyclopedias
   you've been waiting for.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.034
  Starting tomorrow.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.805
Well, look who's here,

15:05.839 --> 15:08.508
   our lady of the lily-pad.

15:08.541 --> 15:12.078
 You know, I was really
 counting on slicing and dicing
 those green suckers today.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.580
 You'll live.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.616
  And now, so will the frogs.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.551
  You know, at lunch,
  I couldn't help it noticing

15:18.585 --> 15:21.755
 you taking your knife
 and splitting your broccoli.

15:22.188 --> 15:24.124
Juices ran everywhere.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.193
  It was disgusting.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.896
  You know, lettuce is
  a living thing too.

15:29.929 --> 15:33.233
  Why don't you just
  break into the cafeteria
  and free the salad.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.936
   Whose side are
   you on, Screech?

15:37.637 --> 15:39.105
 Well,

15:39.139 --> 15:42.709
on one hand
there's your
friendship to consider,

15:42.742 --> 15:44.577
and on the other hand,

15:44.611 --> 15:47.947
  there's a feel of a nice,
  cold pancreas
  against your skin.

15:50.183 --> 15:52.719
   I'm sorry, Nikki.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.121
   Doesn't anybody
   care about frogs?

15:55.155 --> 15:56.756
 -No.
 -No.

15:58.892 --> 16:00.126
 Lisa,

16:00.160 --> 16:02.562
  did you really want
  to dissect a frog?

16:02.595 --> 16:04.764
 No. I'd rather
 work on my cuticles.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.100
   And you're not mad at me
   for letting the frogs go?

16:07.133 --> 16:09.703
No way.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.839
   And when Mr. Morton tell you
   to dissect a frog,

16:12.872 --> 16:16.042
or fail the course,
what are you gonna say?

16:16.042 --> 16:18.044
  "Pass the scalpel."

16:23.783 --> 16:24.651
  Hello, Miss Bliss.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.620
 Nikki. You're right
 on time. Come on in.

16:29.155 --> 16:33.560
 I thought life is supposed
 to be simple when you are 14.

16:33.593 --> 16:36.696
   Everybody's blaming me
   for letting the frogs go.

16:36.730 --> 16:39.766
 Well, obviously,
 not everybody
 wanted you to do it.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.135
  The others have
  their rights, too.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.772
   Didn't Mr. Morton
   discuss with you

16:45.805 --> 16:47.707
some of the scientific
breakthroughs that have

16:47.741 --> 16:49.242
   started with
   animal dissection?

16:50.076 --> 16:51.644
  Well, sure.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.080
   But we're not doing
   heart or brain research.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.849
 Mikey wants to dissect a frog

16:55.882 --> 16:58.952
to find out how far he
can drop-kick a kidney.

16:59.719 --> 17:00.720
 I...

17:01.187 --> 17:04.156
 Mikey really wants to do that?

17:04.190 --> 17:06.693
You agree with me,
don't you, Miss Bliss?

17:06.726 --> 17:10.163
Nikki, I can't agree
with what you've done.

17:10.195 --> 17:13.700
 But I do think there
 should be alternatives
 to dissection.

17:13.733 --> 17:14.800
 Right.

17:14.834 --> 17:17.837
  And I think I
  may have found one.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.940
I called a friend of
mine at the university

17:21.040 --> 17:23.676
 and he told me about
 this computer program

17:23.710 --> 17:26.179
   that simulates
   a frog's anatomy.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.848
  Great.
  Now all the kids can work
  on a computer

17:28.882 --> 17:30.116
  instead of a frog.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.052
Well, not all the kids.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.054
Only the ones who
feel like you and I do.

17:34.087 --> 17:36.056
 But the other kids
 don't have a choice.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.757
I let all the frogs go.

17:37.791 --> 17:41.828
 Nikki, unfortunately,
 Mr. Morton just
 got a fresh delivery,

17:42.762 --> 17:44.197
   probably from Frogs-R-Us.

17:47.934 --> 17:50.704
  Mr.
  Belding, are you all right?

17:51.905 --> 17:54.074
 You haven't seemed
 like yourself lately.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.809
 Nonsense.
 Of course I'm myself.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.243
  Well, can you tell me then,

17:57.277 --> 18:00.780
why is it that every
other teacher in the school
is begging for supplies

18:00.814 --> 18:04.117
  and I get the entire contents
  of Neiman Marcus catalog.

18:04.150 --> 18:07.587
  Because you're special,
  Miss Bliss.
  Never forget that.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.056
   Why did you let Nikki off
   with just a mild warning

18:10.090 --> 18:12.659
  when she deserved
  at least detention?

18:12.692 --> 18:15.195
Hell, boy, there is no
pleasing you, is there?

18:15.228 --> 18:19.165
 Just accept
 the gifts and don't worry.
 Be happy.

18:19.199 --> 18:22.068
 Gifts like these don't
 come without strings.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.037
   I want the truth.

18:24.037 --> 18:25.205
  All right.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.941
  I know about
  Trumphill Academy.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.042
What about it?

18:29.075 --> 18:31.845
 They're trying to
 woo you away from me.

18:31.878 --> 18:34.047
  -Woo?
  -Yes, woo.

18:34.047 --> 18:35.715
  They wooed away two
  teachers last year

18:35.749 --> 18:38.118
and I wasn't gonna
let them woo you, too.

18:38.151 --> 18:41.054
Lucky I found that
letter in your mailbox.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.056
  You looked through my mail?

18:43.089 --> 18:45.191
  I was just going
  to hand it to you,

18:45.225 --> 18:47.961
   but you had
   already left the office.

18:48.061 --> 18:50.063
 And you saw the return address
 on the envelope

18:50.063 --> 18:52.065
and assumed they
were offering me a job.

18:52.065 --> 18:53.800
 Well, what else could it be?

18:53.833 --> 18:56.069
Well, it could be
one of those
teachers from last year

18:56.102 --> 18:57.904
 writing to say hello.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.041
   I hate it when I'm wrong.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.044
I'm not talking to you.

19:04.077 --> 19:05.211
 Okay.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.049
Oh, hi, Carrie.

19:09.082 --> 19:12.285
 What did Belding give you now?
 Rhode Island?

19:12.318 --> 19:16.089
   Tina, the whole thing
   has been one big mistake.

19:16.122 --> 19:18.058
  If you just give me a minute,
  I'll explain.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.260
Am I glad I found you.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.828
   What is it, Mylo.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.096
   Miss Bliss,
   I hate to tell you this,

19:23.129 --> 19:25.932
 but Mr. Morton is hopping mad,

19:26.032 --> 19:27.133
 if you get my drift.

19:31.271 --> 19:35.041
 -Mr. Morton.
 -Miss Bliss, she did it again.

19:35.709 --> 19:37.677
 Who did what?

19:37.711 --> 19:42.182
  Your Nikki has once again
  absconded with my
  four-legged hopping friends.

19:42.215 --> 19:45.051
I think you are
jumping to conclusions.

19:45.085 --> 19:47.821
Are you sure they
weren't just misplaced?

19:47.854 --> 19:50.290
   They are green.
   They jump and they croak.

19:50.323 --> 19:53.860
 One tends not to misplace
 something like that.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.963
 Now, what are you
 going to do about it?

19:58.131 --> 20:01.167
Well, I'll talk to her.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.268
 But first, I have to find her.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.270
Check the nearest pond.

20:05.171 --> 20:08.008
 You could be wrong, you know.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.943
  He's not wrong, Miss Bliss.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.811
   I took the frogs.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.417
  Welcome home, boys.

20:19.152 --> 20:20.353
Nikki,

20:20.387 --> 20:23.790
  I think you owe
  Mr. Morton an apology.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.359
 I'm sorry, Mr. Morton,
 for taking the frogs.

20:26.393 --> 20:30.063
  I just don't think it's right
  to experiment on
  any living thing.

20:30.096 --> 20:32.932
And you'll never
convince me otherwise.

20:32.966 --> 20:36.336
 However, I have to respect
 the rights and
 opinions of others.

20:36.369 --> 20:40.106
 If I don't, I'm no different
 that the things I'm against.

20:41.975 --> 20:43.443
Nikki,

20:43.476 --> 20:46.279
 I'm sure Mr.
 Morton can't argue with that.

20:46.312 --> 20:50.350
  I'm a man of science,
  I can argue with anything.

20:50.383 --> 20:53.086
   I returned all but
   one of the frogs.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.055
 Mine is living free.

20:57.023 --> 21:01.227
This leaves me no
choice but to fail you.

21:01.261 --> 21:04.164
   I think if you take a look
   at this computer program,

21:04.197 --> 21:06.833
 you'll see that
 you do have a choice.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.235
Good news, Mr. Morton.

21:09.269 --> 21:12.872
  Mr. Belding says you can have
  you pick of
  anything on this cart.

21:12.906 --> 21:16.176
 Hang on a second.
 Aren't those my visual aids?

21:16.209 --> 21:18.345
  They were your visual aids.

21:21.181 --> 21:23.850
 Touch that
 globe again, Morton,

21:23.883 --> 21:26.319
 and you'll be my
 next history lesson.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.094
 ( instrumental music plays )
