AKU: Long ago,
in a distant land,

00:04.672 --> 00:09.385
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.469 --> 00:13.056
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:13.139 --> 00:18.603
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword,

00:18.686 --> 00:21.606
stepped forth to oppose me.

was struck,

00:26.694 --> 00:29.364
I tore open a portal in time

00:29.447 --> 00:33.952
and flung him into the future,
where my evil is law.

00:34.369 --> 00:38.206
Now the fool seeks to return
to the past

00:38.540 --> 00:43.002
and undo the future that is Aku.
