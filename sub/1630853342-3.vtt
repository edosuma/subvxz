WEBVTT

00:25.329 --> 00:27.984
Previously on
Star Strange New Worlds...

00:28.028 --> 00:29.333
Is everything
all right, Captain?

00:29.377 --> 00:30.813
We're going back out.

00:30.856 --> 00:32.510
Captain Pike.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.817
Lieutenant La'An Noonien,
Chief of Security.

00:34.860 --> 00:37.167
-La'An.
-Hey, Chief.

00:37.211 --> 00:38.560
Wait, you two know each other?

00:38.603 --> 00:40.344
She helped me
find my way back home.

00:40.388 --> 00:42.607
Permission to return
to Enterprise, sir.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.870
-What's the mission?
-Explore.

00:44.914 --> 00:46.437
We seek out new life,

00:46.481 --> 00:47.960
new civilizations.

00:48.004 --> 00:51.486
We boldly go where no one
has gone before.

00:53.270 --> 00:55.620
First officer's log,

00:55.664 --> 00:58.101
stardate 1224.3.

00:58.145 --> 01:00.234
TheEnterprise has arrived
at Hetemit 9,

01:00.277 --> 01:04.064
the site of an abandoned
Illyrian colony.

01:04.107 --> 01:06.370
Illyrians are
a humanoid species known

01:06.414 --> 01:07.719
for modifying their genes

01:07.763 --> 01:09.156
to enhance their capabilities

01:09.199 --> 01:11.636
and levels of function.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.595
However, because
genetic modification

01:13.638 --> 01:14.857
is forbidden in the Federation,

01:14.900 --> 01:17.686
they have always been outcasts.

01:17.729 --> 01:19.905
Our presence here
is part of a standing mission

01:19.949 --> 01:21.472
to discover
what happened to them.

01:22.517 --> 01:25.737
Unfortunately, research time
on the surface is limited,

01:25.781 --> 01:28.827
as the planet is regularly swept
by ion storms.

01:28.871 --> 01:32.179
One of which
is fast approaching.

01:34.181 --> 01:36.139
It's funny how
genetic modification

01:36.183 --> 01:37.358
still puts everyone on edge.

01:38.837 --> 01:40.535
Even you, it would seem.

01:40.578 --> 01:42.972
I just don't like loose ends.

01:45.061 --> 01:46.845
Damn it.
I wish we had more time.

01:46.889 --> 01:48.412
These shelters are pretty old.
We should get everyone back

01:48.456 --> 01:50.110
-to the Enterprise.
-All right, everyone,

01:50.153 --> 01:51.676
pack up your data and head
to the rendezvous point

01:51.720 --> 01:53.287
for transport.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.506
Spock, this is Pike. Come in.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.552
The storm must be interfering.
I'll go grab him.

01:57.595 --> 01:58.901
No, no. I got him.

01:58.944 --> 02:01.556
You get the rest
of the team back home.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.268
Ensign Lance.

02:36.243 --> 02:37.679
Energize.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.944
Commander, I'm having trouble
getting a lock on your signals.

02:41.987 --> 02:43.598
The ion storm is interfering.

02:43.641 --> 02:46.601
Storm's only getting closer,
Enterprise.

02:46.644 --> 02:48.733
One second, Commander.

02:48.777 --> 02:50.953
Energizing.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.484
Transporter Room to Engineering.
Hemmer, I'm losing them.

03:00.528 --> 03:04.184
Rerouting auxiliary power.
Get ready.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.752
Chief Hemmer to Bridge.

03:07.796 --> 03:10.668
Prepare for temporary engagement
of emergency systems backups.

03:33.778 --> 03:36.172
Engineering to Transporter.
Try it now.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.001
What the...?
How did you...?

03:39.044 --> 03:41.482
I am a genius. Move quickly.

03:41.525 --> 03:43.527
Copy.

03:50.186 --> 03:52.275
Better not be out of miracles,
Mr. Kyle.

03:52.319 --> 03:54.669
Captain and Mr. Spock
are still on the surface.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.374
Captain, I think
I've managed to uncover

04:04.418 --> 04:05.723
a previously undiscovered cache

04:05.767 --> 04:07.334
of journals
that may be relevant.

04:07.377 --> 04:08.726
-I'm looking forward
to reading them.
-Great.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.075
How about we get
to the rendezvous point

04:10.119 --> 04:11.555
before the storm
overtakes us, so you can?

04:20.695 --> 04:23.263
Pike to Enterprise.
Two to beam up.

04:28.442 --> 04:31.314
-I can't get a lock.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.403
-Pull more power.
-Power's not gonna help.

04:33.447 --> 04:34.796
The ion storm is too strong.

04:34.839 --> 04:36.319
We try to transport them
through that,

04:36.363 --> 04:38.278
who knows when we'll get back?

04:38.321 --> 04:40.889
Number One to Captain Pike.

04:40.932 --> 04:43.848
You and Mr. Spock should find
shelter until the storm passes,

04:43.892 --> 04:45.720
-and quickly.
-Copy, Number One.

04:47.156 --> 04:48.592
Suggestions, Mr. Spock?

04:48.636 --> 04:50.420
Run.

04:58.341 --> 05:00.343
Space.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.781
The final frontier.

05:05.740 --> 05:09.526
These are the voyages
of the starshipEnterprise.

05:10.527 --> 05:13.356
Its five-year mission:

05:13.400 --> 05:16.577
to explore strange new worlds...

05:18.535 --> 05:21.059
...to seek out new life

05:21.103 --> 05:24.672
and new civilizations,

05:24.715 --> 05:28.763
to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

06:59.070 --> 07:01.943
The captain and Mr. Spock
are stuck on the surface.

07:01.986 --> 07:03.858
As soon as it's safe,
we'll get them back.

07:03.901 --> 07:05.381
In the meantime,

07:05.425 --> 07:08.906
we do our jobs. Cadet Uhura,

07:08.950 --> 07:10.299
can you get a signal?

07:10.342 --> 07:12.083
No, Commander.

07:12.127 --> 07:15.522
The ion storm is functionally
a communications blackout.

07:15.565 --> 07:17.524
I want to know the second
you connect with the captain.

07:17.567 --> 07:20.570
-Yes, Commander.
-Lieutenant Wheeler,

07:20.614 --> 07:22.311
I want round-the-clock
monitoring of the storm.

07:22.354 --> 07:24.618
The second it starts to let up,
I want to know.

07:24.661 --> 07:26.489
And tell Chief Kyle
to have relief ready.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.665
I want the transporter
standing by.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.065
Ensign Lance?

07:37.108 --> 07:38.370
Are you all right?

07:38.414 --> 07:39.807
It's too dark in here.

07:39.850 --> 07:42.374
Okay, it's been a long day
for all of us.

07:42.418 --> 07:45.508
But maybe this is something
you should, you know,

07:45.552 --> 07:47.510
do in your own quarters?

07:47.554 --> 07:49.556
I need to feel the light
on my skin.

07:51.819 --> 07:54.474
Whatever tweaks your freak, pal.

07:57.215 --> 07:58.216
What the hell are you doing?

07:58.260 --> 07:59.653
Ortegas to Security.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.393
I need help on Deck 14.

08:18.236 --> 08:21.413
Computer,
increase illumination 25%.

08:53.315 --> 08:54.882
Number One to Dr. M'Benga.

08:54.925 --> 08:57.580
What is the status
of the landing party?

08:57.624 --> 09:00.322
M'
Good evening, Commander.
Funny you should mention it.

09:00.365 --> 09:02.454
I have several of them
in here as we speak,

09:02.498 --> 09:05.022
presenting with some
very curious symptoms.

09:05.066 --> 09:08.112
I was about to call you.
Are you feeling all right?

09:08.156 --> 09:10.114
-I'm okay.
-Better come down here

09:10.158 --> 09:13.422
and let me check you out,
just in case.

09:13.465 --> 09:14.902
On my way.

09:27.915 --> 09:29.394
M'
It's odd.

09:29.438 --> 09:32.963
Half of them have burned
or shocked themselves,

09:33.007 --> 09:36.010
all on sources of illumination,
and yet

09:36.053 --> 09:38.839
the light's the only thing
that seems to calm them down.

09:38.882 --> 09:42.059
They're being attracted
to light.

09:42.103 --> 09:45.628
So much so they're willing
to hurt themselves to get to it.

09:45.672 --> 09:49.806
I take it you haven't exhibited
any of these unusual behaviors?

09:49.850 --> 09:52.548
No.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.071
You found nothing else
in their systems?

09:54.115 --> 09:55.856
No form of contagion?

09:55.899 --> 09:57.901
Well, the transporter's
biofilters

09:57.945 --> 09:59.816
would have screened out
anything abnormal.

09:59.860 --> 10:03.385
But I ran viral and bacterial
scans anyway as a precaution.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.213
They're clean.

10:05.256 --> 10:07.128
Only thing I've been able
to find

10:07.171 --> 10:09.521
is a severe drop
in cholecalciferol.

10:11.262 --> 10:13.787
Vitamin D?

10:13.830 --> 10:16.137
All show levels in the red.

10:16.180 --> 10:19.357
Outside of this
and the aberrant behavior,

10:19.401 --> 10:20.968
you'd never know they were sick.

10:21.011 --> 10:22.752
How were my vitamin D levels?

10:22.796 --> 10:24.711
Normal.

10:24.754 --> 10:29.280
Whatever affected them
seems to have missed you.

10:29.324 --> 10:32.153
I'd like to take a blood sample
nonetheless.

10:32.196 --> 10:34.416
Commander?

10:34.459 --> 10:36.548
Of course.

10:36.592 --> 10:39.943
Have you been able to reach
the captain and Mr. Spock?

10:39.987 --> 10:42.729
Still too much interference
with the storm.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.558
We'll have to hope
they weren't exposed

10:46.602 --> 10:48.299
to whatever this is.

10:48.343 --> 10:50.562
I have to believe the landing
party came into contact

10:50.606 --> 10:53.522
with something down there
that the biofilters missed.

10:53.565 --> 10:55.350
Nonsense.

10:55.393 --> 10:56.568
The biofilters would have caught

10:56.612 --> 10:58.570
any contamination
during transport.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.703
Unless it was something they
weren't programmed to catch.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.313
Can't happen.

11:02.357 --> 11:04.533
If they don't recognize it,
they filter it out.

11:04.576 --> 11:07.623
What about the ion storm? Could
that have interfered with it?

11:07.667 --> 11:09.581
-No.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.496
I mean...

11:12.454 --> 11:13.673
...it shouldn't have.

11:13.716 --> 11:14.978
And yet M'Benga's got four

11:15.022 --> 11:17.111
landing party members
in sickbay.

11:17.154 --> 11:20.636
Anything else abnormal during
transport you can think of?

11:20.680 --> 11:22.638
Besides the landing party's
atoms

11:22.682 --> 11:26.424
almost getting mixed up into
a puddle of bioorganic stew?

11:26.468 --> 11:27.991
No.

11:28.035 --> 11:30.167
I can sense that expression,
you know.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.735
Oh, I know.

11:32.779 --> 11:35.738
You had to pull a lot of power
to keep pattern stabilization.

11:35.782 --> 11:38.306
Could that have inhibited
the biofilters?

11:38.349 --> 11:39.916
Not only are all
the ship's transporters

11:39.960 --> 11:42.310
networked for emergency power
distribution,

11:42.353 --> 11:44.921
the new systems have discrete
backups for biofilters

11:44.965 --> 11:46.270
and pattern stabilizers.

11:48.229 --> 11:53.147
I will run a level 5 diagnostic
ship-wide.

11:53.190 --> 11:55.323
-To make you feel better,
Commander.
-Thank you.

11:55.366 --> 11:59.283
Which, I might add,
may well take all night.

12:11.121 --> 12:12.862
On screen.

12:12.906 --> 12:14.298
Number One?

12:14.342 --> 12:16.387
Are you and Lieutenant Spock
all right?

12:16.431 --> 12:18.694
We're fine, but the storm has
us pinned down in the library.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.784
We have an emerging situation
here.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.395
Landing party members
are getting ill.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.267
The doctor thinks
they were exposed

12:26.310 --> 12:27.747
to something on the surface.

12:27.790 --> 12:30.314
What kind of something?

12:30.358 --> 12:32.577
Apologies.
The signal's out again.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.492
The storm's interference
is too strong.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.151
Computer, show me everything
you have

12:41.195 --> 12:42.936
on Illyrian
genetic modifications,

12:42.979 --> 12:45.025
specifically related
to disease control.

12:45.068 --> 12:47.244
Working.

12:47.288 --> 12:49.072
Computer,
isolate any files pertaining

12:49.116 --> 12:50.682
to the original
Illyrian settlement

12:50.726 --> 12:52.423
on the Vaultera Nebula.

12:52.467 --> 12:55.252
Records are limited.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.604
You wanted to see me, Chief?

12:59.648 --> 13:02.869
Yes. Several landing party
members

13:02.912 --> 13:06.220
are showing symptoms
of some kind of contamination.

13:06.263 --> 13:07.656
Security needs
to keep an eye out

13:07.699 --> 13:09.658
for anyone exhibiting
strange behavior.

13:09.701 --> 13:10.920
Mm-hmm.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.663
Illyrians?

13:14.706 --> 13:17.840
You think this contamination
might be related to them?

13:17.884 --> 13:19.886
I don't know what to think.
I'm just doing research.

13:19.929 --> 13:22.584
Well, it seems to me,
things like this are exactly

13:22.627 --> 13:25.848
why the Federation is so wary
of genetically-modified species

13:25.892 --> 13:27.241
like the Illyrians.

13:27.284 --> 13:28.895
You start breaking down
the genetic code,

13:28.938 --> 13:31.071
who knows what the unexpected
consequences can be?

13:31.114 --> 13:33.508
If the problem originated
with the Illyrians,

13:33.551 --> 13:35.640
maybe they could also
provide us with a cure.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.817
Isn't using any Illyrian
medical tech

13:37.860 --> 13:39.079
against Federation regs?

13:39.122 --> 13:41.995
Thanks to the Eugenics Wars.

13:42.038 --> 13:45.389
I imagine you know all about
that period in history.

13:47.522 --> 13:50.438
Well, you don't grow up with
a bioengineered mass murderer

13:50.481 --> 13:53.658
as your ancestor
and not develop a thick skin.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.617
Khan Noonien Singh.

13:55.660 --> 13:59.751
Made myself a kind of an expert
on him when I was a kid.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.886
I never think of you as a child.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.018
Yeah.

14:06.628 --> 14:07.629
For a while there,
the worst thing

14:07.672 --> 14:09.283
that had ever happened to me

14:09.326 --> 14:12.547
was a bunch of
the other kids' teasing.

14:12.590 --> 14:15.419
I'd hope that someone
with your last name would know

14:15.463 --> 14:18.074
that snap judgments made
on genetics are faulty at best.

14:18.118 --> 14:21.686
Individuals are
so much more than just...

14:21.730 --> 14:24.080
Is it me or is it dark in here?

14:27.170 --> 14:29.869
-La'An?

14:29.912 --> 14:32.001
Is this the only light you have?

14:32.045 --> 14:33.524
Number One to Dr. M'Benga?

14:33.568 --> 14:34.612
M'
Commander?

14:34.656 --> 14:37.528
I think we have a new problem.

14:39.661 --> 14:41.445
M'
Same vitamin D deficiency.

14:41.489 --> 14:42.969
Same attraction to light.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.318
She wasn't part
of the landing party.

14:44.361 --> 14:45.058
She never went down
to the planet.

14:45.101 --> 14:46.581
I know.

14:46.624 --> 14:49.062
How is that possible?
How is it spreading?

14:49.105 --> 14:51.107
-I don't know.
-Internal contact tracing

14:51.151 --> 14:53.109
shows that Lieutenant Noonien
shared a turbolift

14:53.153 --> 14:54.937
with Ensign Lance.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.157
-It's a possible source
of exposure.
-M'Maybe.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.072
Except whatever it is
isn't being passed

14:59.115 --> 15:02.466
by any traceable viral
or bacteriological means.

15:02.510 --> 15:04.207
What do you recommend, Doctor?

15:04.251 --> 15:07.950
To keep it from spreading,
full lockdown.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.694
Computer, open a channel
ship-wide.

15:12.737 --> 15:14.565
Attention all crew members,

15:14.609 --> 15:16.959
we are initiating
Level Five lockdown protocol,

15:17.003 --> 15:19.005
effective immediately.

15:19.048 --> 15:22.791
All nonessential personnel
will be confined to quarters

15:22.834 --> 15:24.271
until further notice.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.229
All on-duty personnel

15:26.273 --> 15:30.364
will be confined to specific
work zones until further notice.

15:35.673 --> 15:37.588
You have your orders.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.514
I believe there is
a human phrase.

15:50.558 --> 15:52.473
"A watched kettle never boils."

15:52.516 --> 15:53.735
It's a pot.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.606
And in this case,
I'm pretty sure

15:55.650 --> 15:57.739
we're gonna get hit
with the scalding water.

15:57.782 --> 15:59.915
You are deliberately mixing
my metaphor

15:59.959 --> 16:02.483
in order to indulge
your anxiety.

16:02.526 --> 16:06.095
There are sick people on my
ship, and we're stuck down here?

16:06.139 --> 16:09.142
I don't like feeling helpless.

16:09.185 --> 16:10.708
Pacing relentlessly
back and forth

16:10.752 --> 16:12.232
will not change the situation.

16:16.410 --> 16:19.500
This place is fun.
They should sell tickets.

16:20.501 --> 16:21.893
It seems this particular group
of Illyrians

16:21.937 --> 16:23.895
wanted to join the Federation.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.988
As Federation law forbids
genetic manipulation,

16:29.031 --> 16:31.381
this group was attempting
to reverse its DNA modifications

16:31.425 --> 16:33.079
to gain entry.

16:33.122 --> 16:35.168
De-engineering themselves,
as it were.

16:35.211 --> 16:37.605
-That's a new one.
-Indeed.

16:37.648 --> 16:39.999
Any clue as to what happened
to the colony?

16:40.042 --> 16:42.523
I am only halfway through
these records, Captain.

16:43.611 --> 16:45.047
Consider maybe skipping
to the end

16:45.091 --> 16:46.918
before the storm tears
the building apart?

17:04.240 --> 17:06.416
Tell me you saw that, too.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.201
I did.

17:08.244 --> 17:12.031
Although what I saw,
exactly, I am not sure.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.142
What are y'all doing?

17:37.143 --> 17:39.188
Computer, end simulation!

17:41.060 --> 17:43.236
-What did you do that for?!
-We need light!

17:43.279 --> 17:45.194
How many more?

17:45.238 --> 17:47.153
Almost 50. I had to open

17:47.196 --> 17:49.546
our auxiliary bay
to handle the overflow.

17:49.590 --> 17:50.895
Contact tracing
is all over the map.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.375
Some people are getting it

17:52.419 --> 17:54.116
after being down the hall
from someone who's sick.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.726
Meanwhile,
Cadet Uhura's roommates

17:55.770 --> 17:58.338
both came down with it,
she's completely fine.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.128
Hemmer, did you find anything?

18:06.172 --> 18:07.912
Of course. That's why
I'm wandering around the ship

18:07.956 --> 18:10.132
in the middle of the night
running diagnostics.

18:10.176 --> 18:12.003
For fun.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.180
Doctor, we need to check your
emergency medical transporter

18:14.223 --> 18:17.400
for systems integration
and excess power usage.

18:17.444 --> 18:19.533
Please!

18:19.576 --> 18:21.796
I have research in there.

18:26.888 --> 18:29.369
You doing anything right now?

18:29.412 --> 18:30.892
If you hadn't noticed,
I'm in the middle

18:30.935 --> 18:32.807
of a ship-wide
medical emergency.

18:32.850 --> 18:35.201
Trust me, I've noticed.

18:39.596 --> 18:41.598
My medical transporter is fine.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.513
That shouldn't have affected
the lights.

18:43.557 --> 18:45.820
Please stop messing around
in here!

18:47.213 --> 18:49.650
You're only making things worse.

18:52.305 --> 18:54.785
Point taken.

19:18.896 --> 19:22.813
Whatever made that sound,
looks like it's gone.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.815
A curious figure of speech.

19:28.254 --> 19:30.212
Captain.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.612
-I think we know
what made that sound.
-Indeed.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.797
Oh, you're lucky.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.799
Any closer and that
could have hit the carotid.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.279
On a human.

19:53.322 --> 19:55.194
The journals did mention
unconfirmed rumors

19:55.237 --> 19:56.934
of creatures
living inside the storms.

19:56.978 --> 19:58.675
I think we can confirm them.

20:05.073 --> 20:07.945
What do you think the odds are
that'll hold?

20:07.989 --> 20:10.209
Perhaps we should weight
probability in our favor.

20:12.428 --> 20:16.737
A lockdown is instituted,
you're off duty, you come here.

20:16.780 --> 20:20.131
Your roommates contract
the contagion, you do not.

20:20.175 --> 20:21.524
Why?

20:21.568 --> 20:23.613
I went to bed.

20:31.578 --> 20:32.753
Like this?

20:32.796 --> 20:34.755
I closed the door.

20:34.798 --> 20:36.887
I need it pitch-black
to fall asleep.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.367
I'm like The Princess and the...

20:39.368 --> 20:40.587
...Peathat way.

20:49.204 --> 20:51.946
Uhura wasexposed to the same
conditions as her roommates,

20:51.989 --> 20:56.037
with one exception:
she was in the dark.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.474
I ran an electromagnetic scan
on the ship.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.824
Around infected crew members,

21:00.868 --> 21:04.306
light waves carry
additional energy.

21:04.350 --> 21:07.266
The contagion travels on light.

21:07.309 --> 21:10.573
Insidious.

21:10.617 --> 21:13.184
And remarkable.

21:13.228 --> 21:15.839
The most successful viruses
propagate in a host,

21:15.883 --> 21:17.841
then trigger
a spreading response.

21:17.885 --> 21:20.104
The way a common cold
makes humans sneeze

21:20.148 --> 21:22.324
to transfer itself
to other humans.

21:22.368 --> 21:25.327
Once we're exposed,
this virus triggers

21:25.371 --> 21:28.504
our pleasure centers when we are
in close contact with light.

21:28.548 --> 21:30.637
Light is literally everywhere.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.203
Any light wave could carry
the infection.

21:32.247 --> 21:33.857
It's only a matter of time

21:33.901 --> 21:37.426
before we all become infected
if we don't stop it.

21:37.470 --> 21:39.123
So how do we stop it?

21:39.167 --> 21:40.995
What's the one thing
we can control

21:41.038 --> 21:42.388
that counteracts light?

21:42.431 --> 21:44.607
Dark hates light,
light hates dark.

21:44.651 --> 21:46.914
So we turn off the lights.

21:46.957 --> 21:48.350
We have a sickbay
full of patients

21:48.394 --> 21:50.265
who are essentially
light addicts.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.398
The virus is gonna make them
very uncomfortable.

21:52.441 --> 21:56.924
Would it be too intrusive
to sedate all of them?

21:58.186 --> 21:59.840
Given the alternative...

22:01.798 --> 22:03.931
...I think it's the best option.

22:19.381 --> 22:20.730
Computer,
narrow search parameters

22:20.774 --> 22:22.471
to Illyrian
genetic modifications.

22:22.515 --> 22:24.778
-Classified.
-Override.

22:27.868 --> 22:29.826
Narrow search parameters
to Illyrian

22:29.870 --> 22:32.786
genetic modifications
related to disease control.

22:32.829 --> 22:34.527
-Classified.
-Override. Override.

22:45.799 --> 22:48.671
Alert. Blackout override
in Transporter Room.

22:48.715 --> 22:51.761
Danger of critical
circuit overload.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.372
Commander Chin-Riley
to Transporter Room.

22:53.415 --> 22:55.635
-What's going on?

22:56.592 --> 22:59.073
Acknowledge.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.643
Computer, clear screen.

23:24.054 --> 23:26.100
Hemmer, what are you doing?

23:26.143 --> 23:27.667
Performing a miracle.

23:27.710 --> 23:30.583
Come in. You'll enjoy it.

23:32.759 --> 23:35.675
What is that thing?

23:35.718 --> 23:37.851
An iron-sulfur alloy, I believe.

23:37.894 --> 23:41.289
It took all my skills to isolate
a portion that could transport

23:41.332 --> 23:43.378
from the core of Hetemit 9.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.728
It's not fully materialized.

23:45.772 --> 23:48.470
You're transporting a piece
of the planet's core?

23:48.514 --> 23:50.733
Mantle, to be precise.

23:50.777 --> 23:53.780
I want to feel the radiance
on my skin.

23:53.823 --> 23:56.739
I've almost stabilized
the signal.

23:56.783 --> 23:58.915
Hemmer, it's a thousand degrees.
It'll kill you.

23:58.959 --> 24:01.178
More like 10,000.

24:01.222 --> 24:03.093
Just a few seconds more
and it'll be here.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.490
Hemmer, stop!

24:59.062 --> 25:01.238
Does that thing have
a setting for stun?

25:01.282 --> 25:03.110
I am arming us with knowledge.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.156
You think the Illyrians knew
how to stop these things?

25:06.200 --> 25:08.115
Perhaps.
But even if they did not,

25:08.158 --> 25:09.943
we may be able to learn
from their misfortune.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.294
I have deduced that these
creatures did not destroy them.

25:13.337 --> 25:14.948
That, in fact,
they began to appear

25:14.991 --> 25:16.427
as the Illyrians were starting
to be wiped out

25:16.471 --> 25:17.820
by a mysterious disease.

25:17.864 --> 25:21.345
I'm still waiting
for the useful part.

25:21.389 --> 25:22.999
I have found no entry describing

25:23.043 --> 25:25.219
the creatures causing harm
to the colonists.

25:27.700 --> 25:30.267
My ears are popping.

25:30.311 --> 25:32.008
The atmospheric pressure
is rising.

25:32.052 --> 25:33.401
Ionization levels in the storm

25:33.444 --> 25:34.750
are now lethal
to organic matter.

25:51.506 --> 25:52.551
Ground.

26:34.854 --> 26:37.857
-Looks like they're gone.
-Indeed.

26:37.900 --> 26:41.295
And thanks to them,
it would seem, we are not.

26:44.646 --> 26:47.431
How in the exact hell
are you carrying him?

26:47.475 --> 26:50.130
Never mind. He needs to be
sedated before he wakes up.

26:50.173 --> 26:52.175
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to be next.

26:54.438 --> 26:58.007
My cholecalciferol levels
are plunging.

26:58.051 --> 27:00.923
And it's down to Nurse Chapel
and myself, I'm afraid.

27:02.925 --> 27:04.666
You took my blood earlier.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.668
Did you find anything that
could help synthesize a cure?

27:06.712 --> 27:08.365
-Just because you haven't
caught this thing yet...
-I'm immune.

27:08.409 --> 27:11.151
-You don't know that.
-I've already come down with it,

27:11.194 --> 27:14.545
and my immune system did what
it was bioengineered to do.

27:14.589 --> 27:17.766
I didn't tell you earlier
because...

27:20.073 --> 27:21.640
...I'm an Illyrian.

27:23.250 --> 27:25.469
-Would that even work?
-No.

27:25.513 --> 27:28.516
Why not? My body knew how
to fight off the infection.

27:28.559 --> 27:30.649
It's not that simple.
There are other factors.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.433
Neither of us has
any experience with...

27:32.476 --> 27:34.609
your unique metabolism.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.480
Mm.

27:36.524 --> 27:37.481
Why do I get the feeling
you're about to quote

27:37.525 --> 27:38.744
Starfleet regulations?

27:38.787 --> 27:39.788
Oh, no, I'm not. I just--

27:39.832 --> 27:41.268
Look, I know there's a directive

27:41.311 --> 27:42.617
against mixing human
and Illyrian blood,

27:42.661 --> 27:45.315
but I couldn't
care less right now.

27:45.359 --> 27:47.100
Then why are we wasting time?

27:47.143 --> 27:48.797
-Go.

27:51.017 --> 27:53.976
-What is the issue?
-I've looked at your blood.

27:54.020 --> 27:56.022
It has no novel antibodies.

27:56.065 --> 27:59.590
And that is consistent with what
I know of Illyrian biochemistry.

27:59.634 --> 28:04.117
You don't create antibodies
that lie dormant.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.206
Your immune system
literally burns out

28:06.249 --> 28:08.687
new infections immediately.

28:12.778 --> 28:17.696
Which means I have nothing left
to synthesize an antidote from.

28:17.739 --> 28:20.916
So I'm protected
but I can't help anyone else?

28:20.960 --> 28:24.615
Perhaps if I was there
at the moment you were infected.

28:24.659 --> 28:26.269
-You'd better put me out.
-No, no, no, wait.

28:26.313 --> 28:27.880
We'll come up with something.

28:27.923 --> 28:30.099
-There's nothing
to come up with.

28:30.143 --> 28:33.015
You're a Starfleet doctor.
There's always something.

28:36.062 --> 28:38.412
You put a lot of faith
in Starfleet.

28:38.455 --> 28:40.283
That must be hard.

28:41.502 --> 28:44.505
Starfleet is right
about a lot of things,

28:44.548 --> 28:46.507
but not all of them.

28:46.550 --> 28:48.335
Not about us.

28:48.378 --> 28:50.859
-If my blood...
-I understand.

28:50.903 --> 28:53.906
Prejudice has kept people from
helping each other for centuries

28:53.949 --> 28:56.996
with no scientific
justification.

28:57.039 --> 28:59.650
And after we met our neighbors
in the galaxy,

28:59.694 --> 29:02.871
we found new bigotries.

29:03.829 --> 29:06.353
Human and Vulcan blood.

29:06.396 --> 29:08.834
Now it's human and Illyrian.

29:10.270 --> 29:13.534
In any case,
they're meaningless to me.

29:13.577 --> 29:16.798
I am a physician.

29:16.842 --> 29:19.018
I'd beg you to help
if you could,

29:19.061 --> 29:21.498
regulations be damned.

29:21.542 --> 29:23.587
But you can't help here.

29:25.546 --> 29:27.766
I'm sorry.

29:32.858 --> 29:36.122
Now put me out.
Before I lose control.

29:38.733 --> 29:42.128
Warning. Warp core containment
field has been deactivated.

29:42.171 --> 29:46.088
Recommend reestablishing
containment field immediately.

29:51.528 --> 29:54.923
Warning. Warp core containment
field has been deactivated.

29:54.967 --> 29:57.491
Warp core breach imminent.

29:57.534 --> 29:58.797
La'An.

30:07.109 --> 30:09.329
Warning. Containment field
has been deactivated.

30:09.372 --> 30:11.244
Warp core breach imminent.

30:11.287 --> 30:13.333
La'An, stop.

30:13.376 --> 30:14.856
Back away from the panel.

30:14.900 --> 30:17.728
-That's an order.
-Denied, Commander.

30:17.772 --> 30:20.557
You know what'll happen if that
containment field goes down.

30:20.601 --> 30:23.952
We'll be flooded with light.

30:23.996 --> 30:26.085
La'An, stop.

30:26.128 --> 30:29.001
Danger of exposure
to matter/antimatter radiation.

30:29.044 --> 30:31.394
Containment field at 75%.

30:31.438 --> 30:33.527
Seventy percent.

30:33.570 --> 30:35.877
Fifty-five percent.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.792
Radiation nearing
critical levels.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.185
LA'
Let me go.

30:42.579 --> 30:45.800
Containment field at 40%.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.802
Get off of me!

30:47.846 --> 30:49.325
I'm trying to help you.
It's me, La'An.

30:49.369 --> 30:52.067
You know me. I'm your friend.

30:52.111 --> 30:53.503
You lied to me
every day for years.

30:53.547 --> 30:54.853
What kind of friend is that?

30:54.896 --> 30:56.985
-30%.
-You're an abomination.

30:57.029 --> 30:58.813
An augment.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.119
That's what the other kids
called me

31:00.162 --> 31:02.730
when they heard my name:
augment, monster.

31:02.773 --> 31:06.125
Like you are.

31:06.168 --> 31:09.215
Radiation levels are now toxic
to organic species.

31:09.258 --> 31:10.738
Warp core breach imminent.

31:22.532 --> 31:24.099
Pike to Enterprise.
Do you read me?

31:26.797 --> 31:29.365
I think it's safe to go
back out now.

31:29.409 --> 31:31.324
We'll get a stronger signal.

31:36.546 --> 31:40.507
Those plasma creatures...

31:40.550 --> 31:42.944
they went to great lengths
to save our lives.

31:42.988 --> 31:46.078
They shielded us
when the storm broke through.

31:46.121 --> 31:49.385
Why wouldn't they have done
the same for the colonists?

31:49.429 --> 31:51.692
I see two possibilities.

31:51.735 --> 31:53.389
They were not motivated
to save them

31:53.433 --> 31:55.522
because of some previous
interaction with the colonists.

31:55.565 --> 31:57.698
And the second?

31:58.960 --> 32:00.788
They were unable to save
the colonists

32:00.831 --> 32:03.182
because they are the colonists.

32:03.225 --> 32:05.488
How?

32:05.532 --> 32:07.055
I found mention
of some odd behavior

32:07.099 --> 32:09.753
in reaction to the disease
I mentioned earlier.

32:09.797 --> 32:12.626
The infected had a compulsion
for light.

32:12.669 --> 32:15.977
Some were driven so mad,
they ran into the storms,

32:16.021 --> 32:17.370
chasing the lightning.

32:17.413 --> 32:19.111
Wouldn't they have died?

32:19.154 --> 32:21.026
Yes.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.986
Although it is possible
the charged storm particles

32:25.030 --> 32:27.032
bonded with the colonists'
electromagnetic presence,

32:27.075 --> 32:29.208
creating what we saw.

32:32.689 --> 32:34.561
Fascinating.

32:46.921 --> 32:49.445
This is a thorough account
of the colonists' initiative

32:49.489 --> 32:51.056
to renounce
their genetic engineering

32:51.099 --> 32:53.145
in order to join the Federation.

32:55.103 --> 32:57.105
It would seem, even in death,

32:57.149 --> 33:00.108
they wanted us to be aware
of who they really were.

33:05.331 --> 33:06.767
What is it, Spock?

33:08.725 --> 33:11.076
Some Illyrians were,
among other things,

33:11.119 --> 33:13.643
bioengineered to fight disease.

33:13.687 --> 33:16.168
Had they not tried to reverse
their augmentation,

33:16.211 --> 33:18.083
they may not have all died.

33:20.085 --> 33:22.435
They wanted to join
the Federation so badly

33:22.478 --> 33:25.742
their good-faith gesture
got them killed.

33:30.573 --> 33:32.140
It's okay.

33:32.184 --> 33:35.361
It's okay. We got an antidote.

33:35.404 --> 33:36.971
La'An tried to jump
into the warp core

33:37.015 --> 33:39.321
while the containment
field was down.

33:39.365 --> 33:41.628
As I was stopping her,
she got a bad dose of radiation,

33:41.671 --> 33:43.630
and so did I.

33:43.673 --> 33:45.675
Apparently, my body
cured both of us

33:45.719 --> 33:48.026
before I reengaged the field.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.984
La'An is not an Illyrian.

33:50.028 --> 33:53.857
Her proximity to the commander
created chimeric antibodies

33:53.901 --> 33:55.685
in her system.

33:55.729 --> 33:58.297
I was able to synthesize them
into a cure before they set.

33:58.340 --> 34:02.257
Don't thank me.
I know I'm good at my job.

34:04.694 --> 34:07.784
Everyone here owes you
their life.

34:09.786 --> 34:12.572
There's something
I need to take care of.

34:31.765 --> 34:33.810
Mind if I sit?

34:38.119 --> 34:42.297
You pack one hell of a punch,
Lieutenant.

34:42.341 --> 34:43.951
Thank you.

34:43.994 --> 34:46.171
That wasn't a compliment.

34:46.214 --> 34:48.912
What's the penalty for striking
a superior officer?

34:50.958 --> 34:52.742
I can't seem to remember.

34:54.744 --> 34:57.530
Thanks.

34:57.573 --> 35:00.272
I mean, we're friends, right?

35:00.315 --> 35:02.709
Do you want me to tell you it
was just the sickness talking?

35:02.752 --> 35:04.711
I don't know. Was it?

35:04.754 --> 35:08.106
Yes. And also, no.

35:10.586 --> 35:12.545
All my life I've hated augments.

35:12.588 --> 35:14.677
Hated what-what people
thought of me

35:14.721 --> 35:17.245
because I was related to them.

35:17.289 --> 35:20.030
Understanding why they were
outlawed in the Federation.

35:20.074 --> 35:22.903
The damage they did.
They almost destroyed Earth.

35:22.946 --> 35:25.210
The augments, yes, but not us.

35:25.253 --> 35:29.736
My people were never motivated
by domination.

35:29.779 --> 35:33.174
Illyrians seek collaboration
with nature.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.002
By bioengineering our bodies,

35:35.045 --> 35:37.613
we adapt to
naturally-existing habitats.

35:37.657 --> 35:42.052
Instead of terraforming planets,
we modify ourselves.

35:42.096 --> 35:44.185
And there's nothing wrong
with that.

35:44.229 --> 35:47.928
If that's what you believe,
why do you hide it?

35:47.971 --> 35:50.278
Why hide it from me?

35:50.322 --> 35:54.413
I've been hiding it
from a lot of people.

35:57.459 --> 36:00.201
All I ever wanted,

36:00.245 --> 36:05.424
since I first saw the stars,
was to join Starfleet.

36:06.425 --> 36:07.730
I know.

36:09.906 --> 36:12.344
You're the one who gave me
that dream.

36:14.433 --> 36:18.959
And the fact that strawberries
are my comfort food.

36:35.889 --> 36:37.673
Captain.

36:37.717 --> 36:40.894
I'm an Illyrian.

36:40.937 --> 36:44.245
Not from this colony,
from far away.

36:44.289 --> 36:47.596
Starfleet policy is clear.

36:47.640 --> 36:50.295
By not disclosing
my genetic augmentation--

36:50.338 --> 36:53.472
worse, by enlisting
in Starfleet--

36:53.515 --> 36:55.691
I've committed
a Federation offense.

36:58.477 --> 37:00.348
I am resigning my commission

37:00.392 --> 37:05.092
and surrendering myself
for disciplinary review.

37:05.135 --> 37:07.616
I only ask that my sincere
desire to join Starfleet

37:07.660 --> 37:10.184
be taken into consideration.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.795
Rejected.

37:12.839 --> 37:15.537
-Sir?
-I don't care
where you come from.

37:15.581 --> 37:18.279
You're the best
first officer in the fleet.

37:18.323 --> 37:19.802
Thank you, sir, but I feel
obligated to point out

37:19.846 --> 37:20.803
that Starfleet does not allow...

37:20.847 --> 37:23.023
Una, stop.

37:23.066 --> 37:25.591
Chris, that's kind, but I've
broken a dozen regulations.

37:25.634 --> 37:27.636
I lied to get into Starfleet.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.595
According to Federation law,
if you shelter me,

37:29.638 --> 37:32.206
they could come after you, too.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.252
I welcome that discussion.

37:35.601 --> 37:39.039
One thing became clear to me
on Hetemit 9.

37:39.082 --> 37:41.433
Illyrians are severely
misunderstood.

37:41.476 --> 37:44.914
Your actions in the crisis
prove that again.

37:46.220 --> 37:48.788
I just did my job, sir.

37:48.831 --> 37:51.443
No.

37:51.486 --> 37:54.446
You defy every stereotype

37:54.489 --> 37:56.926
the Federation has
about Illyrians.

37:56.970 --> 38:00.016
You're an example to them.

38:00.060 --> 38:02.454
And to all of us.

38:02.497 --> 38:06.153
What do we do
when Starfleet finds out?

38:13.508 --> 38:15.989
You let me worry
about Starfleet.

38:23.083 --> 38:24.911
Oh, before you go...

38:24.954 --> 38:28.306
Uh, the glitch was with the
transporter's biofilter, right?

38:28.349 --> 38:29.568
That's how the virus
got on board?

38:29.611 --> 38:31.961
-Let's get that fixed.
-Yes, sir.

38:32.005 --> 38:33.659
M'
Come in.

38:37.663 --> 38:41.493
It was your medical transporter
that inhibited the biofilters.

38:41.536 --> 38:44.670
The new transporters keep
biofilter and pattern integrity

38:44.713 --> 38:46.541
power systems separate.

38:46.585 --> 38:48.369
But you didn't let them upgrade
the medical transporter

38:48.413 --> 38:50.589
when we were in spacedock.

38:50.632 --> 38:52.852
I'm starting to suspect
you couldn't.

38:57.857 --> 39:00.599
Hemmer's diagnostic

39:00.642 --> 39:04.037
shows you're keeping something
in the pattern buffer.

39:04.080 --> 39:07.562
And whatever it is,
you needed to preserve it,

39:07.606 --> 39:10.086
even if it ended up killing
everyone on the ship.

39:10.130 --> 39:13.046
-Isn't that right, Doctor?
-No.

39:15.004 --> 39:17.050
I didn't know.

39:20.445 --> 39:22.272
It was an accident.

39:22.316 --> 39:23.578
What are you keeping in there

39:23.622 --> 39:26.015
that could be worth
all our lives?

39:32.674 --> 39:33.936
Not what.

39:35.895 --> 39:37.462
Who.

39:37.505 --> 39:39.377
Rukiya.

39:42.641 --> 39:44.817
My daughter.

39:44.860 --> 39:48.037
A year ago, she was diagnosed
with cygnokemia.

39:48.081 --> 39:49.822
Brutal disease.

39:51.780 --> 39:55.305
You can't imagine what it's like
to watch your child wither away.

39:57.569 --> 40:02.008
To see a lifetime of potential
reduced to a 12-week prognosis.

40:02.051 --> 40:04.271
I'm sorry.

40:04.314 --> 40:07.056
I am chief medical officer.

40:08.188 --> 40:11.191
On the flagship of Starfleet.

40:12.845 --> 40:15.630
You'd think I'd be able to do
something about it.

40:18.328 --> 40:20.287
But nothing worked.

40:21.375 --> 40:23.943
Did you know there's no limit

40:23.986 --> 40:25.988
on how long you can store
someone's pattern

40:26.032 --> 40:27.686
in the buffer?

40:30.079 --> 40:33.387
You just have to materialize
them regularly.

40:35.258 --> 40:38.740
In the buffer,
my daughter doesn't age.

40:38.784 --> 40:42.178
And her disease can't progress.

40:42.222 --> 40:45.530
We travel light-years in hours.

40:45.573 --> 40:49.229
And somewhere out there

40:49.272 --> 40:53.102
is a planet that has
the discovery I need.

40:53.146 --> 40:54.321
Only...

40:56.279 --> 40:59.500
...the light virus epidemic
was my fault.

40:59.544 --> 41:02.285
It seems so, yes.

41:02.329 --> 41:05.506
If I thought, even for a second,

41:05.550 --> 41:08.248
that could have happened...

41:08.291 --> 41:11.033
It won't happen again.

41:12.774 --> 41:15.995
I can't endanger our crew
for one life.

41:16.038 --> 41:18.693
No matter how much
that life means to me.

41:21.391 --> 41:26.527
But I ask, would you consider,

41:26.571 --> 41:29.269
before you return me
to Starfleet,

41:29.312 --> 41:30.879
that I might have a chance
to spend

41:30.923 --> 41:33.403
a little more time
with my daughter?

41:38.234 --> 41:39.497
To say goodbye.

41:40.454 --> 41:42.456
No.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.330
I'll provide a dedicated
power source,

41:47.374 --> 41:49.028
direct from the warp core.

41:50.595 --> 41:52.161
This problem?

41:52.205 --> 41:55.251
We can ensure
it never happens again.

42:02.737 --> 42:05.261
I look forward to meeting her
one day.

42:13.269 --> 42:15.141
First officer's personal log.

42:18.623 --> 42:20.581
The lights are back on.

42:20.625 --> 42:23.018
But that doesn't mean
we see clearly.

42:24.280 --> 42:25.934
People are always hiding things.

42:35.291 --> 42:38.033
Hi, Dad. Story time?

42:38.077 --> 42:40.993
You bet.

42:41.036 --> 42:43.822
-Now, where were we?
-King Ridley was about to climb
the tower

42:43.865 --> 42:45.475
to rescue Princess Thalia
from evil Queen Neve.

42:45.519 --> 42:48.609
Wait.

42:48.653 --> 42:50.655
No spoilers.

42:50.698 --> 42:53.962
Dad, we've read this,
like, a hundred times.

42:54.006 --> 42:56.008
That doesn't mean
that the ending

42:56.051 --> 42:57.836
couldn't miraculously change.

42:57.879 --> 42:59.881
Dr. M'Benga stopped
hiding today,

42:59.925 --> 43:01.317
just a little.

43:01.361 --> 43:02.536
And for once,

43:02.580 --> 43:04.712
I did, too.

43:06.671 --> 43:10.979
I told Captain Pike
the truth about myself.

43:11.023 --> 43:13.460
And he defended me.

43:13.503 --> 43:15.288
Told me I was exemplary.

43:15.331 --> 43:17.899
That he would fight for me.

43:21.076 --> 43:23.339
So why do I feel terrible?

43:27.474 --> 43:30.042
What if I hadn't saved
all those lives?

43:32.000 --> 43:34.481
Would the captain feel the same?

43:36.439 --> 43:38.572
What would he do
if I wasn't a hero?

43:38.616 --> 43:40.269
One of the "good ones"?

43:42.271 --> 43:44.796
When will it be enough
to just...

43:46.798 --> 43:48.669
...be an Illyrian?

43:53.631 --> 43:55.850
Computer.

44:01.073 --> 44:02.509
Delete log entry.

44:02.552 --> 44:04.990
Log entry deleted.

44:05.033 --> 44:08.341
M'
If King Ridley would seek out
the Mercury Stone

44:08.384 --> 44:10.386
and win it as his own,

44:10.430 --> 44:13.694
his victory over Queen Neve
would be assured.

44:13.738 --> 44:15.914
It is said
that in the right hands,

44:15.957 --> 44:20.048
the Mercury Stone has the power
to cleanse the land of evil

44:20.092 --> 44:22.964
and bring prosperity to all.

44:23.008 --> 44:25.880
But if it were to fall
into the wrong hands,

44:25.924 --> 44:30.537
the Mercury Stone's power
would bring about a terrible,

44:30.580 --> 44:34.541
long-lasting dark age
across the land.
