WEBVTT

00:03.103 --> 00:05.504
What?
No hustle, no muscle!

00:05.506 --> 00:06.638
Adult adam:
<i>Gym class in the '80s...</i>

00:06.640 --> 00:10.042
<i>The shorts were super-short,</i>
<i>the exercises dumb,</i>

00:10.044 --> 00:13.045
<i>And the games were barbaric.</i>

00:13.146 --> 00:17.216
I know you're aiming
for down there, ryan,
but it's not cool!

00:17.218 --> 00:17.916
<i>Teams weren't assigned,</i>

00:17.918 --> 00:19.818
<i>But handpicked</i>
<i>with brutal honesty</i>

00:19.820 --> 00:23.422
<i>And no consideration</i>
<i>of a fragile</i>
<i>adolescent's feelings.</i>

00:23.424 --> 00:26.959
Oh, god. This is
not gonna be easy.

00:27.060 --> 00:29.661
I'm gonna have to go
with small wonder
over there.

00:29.663 --> 00:32.164
You're going down,
goldnerd.

00:32.166 --> 00:32.765
Sorry.

00:32.767 --> 00:34.833
<i>After years of thinking</i>
<i>I had suffered through</i>

00:34.835 --> 00:36.902
<i>Every indignity</i>
<i>gym class had to offer,</i>

00:36.904 --> 00:39.838
<i>Turns out the worst</i>
<i>was yet to come.</i>

00:39.840 --> 00:42.341
The presidential
fitness test...

00:42.343 --> 00:44.109
Our great president,
ronald reagan,

00:44.111 --> 00:47.212
Along with
the predator himself,
arnold schwarzenegger,

00:47.214 --> 00:50.382
Care enough about you
to demand physical excellence.

00:50.384 --> 00:53.819
Technically, arnold
wasn't the predator.
He was the prey.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.120
Nobody cares, goldfarb.

00:55.122 --> 00:55.988
It's goldberg.

00:55.990 --> 00:57.456
It's literally
written on my shirt.

00:57.458 --> 01:00.926
Good for you.
Now, why is this
test important?

01:00.928 --> 01:04.396
America needs warriors
to fight the evils
of communism.

01:04.398 --> 01:08.067
Tomorrow,
that battle begins with
the seven basic exercises,

01:08.069 --> 01:10.369
Which include
the sit-and-reach,

01:10.371 --> 01:14.373
The mile run,
and the pull-up.

01:14.507 --> 01:16.542
What if you can't
do a pull-up?

01:16.544 --> 01:18.510
I'm asking hypothetically
for a friend

01:18.512 --> 01:20.379
That couldn't make it
today.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.181
Name's josh.
You don't know him.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.249
Well, if you are
the kind of boy

01:24.251 --> 01:26.685
Who is weak of
will and spirit,

01:26.687 --> 01:28.320
You don't have to do it.

01:28.322 --> 01:28.787
(sighs)

01:28.789 --> 01:33.459
Instead,
you will join the girls
in the flexed arm hang.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.561
Josh is not gonna like that.

01:35.563 --> 01:36.595
<i>The news was bleak.</i>

01:36.597 --> 01:38.263
<i>I was definitely screwed.</i>

01:38.265 --> 01:39.198
<i>I mean, josh was screwed.</i>

01:39.200 --> 01:43.435
Honey, it's so late.
Why are you sitting alone
in the dark?

01:44.637 --> 01:47.272
Oh, no.
What's the matter?

01:47.274 --> 01:50.642
Nothing.
Poopie,
something's wrong.

01:50.644 --> 01:51.710
There's a storm
inside you,

01:51.712 --> 01:53.545
And I'm not leaving
till I see a little sunshine.

01:53.547 --> 01:56.515
Why do you always say
super-weird stuff like that?

01:56.517 --> 01:59.051
Looks like someone
needs a sugar shower.

01:59.053 --> 02:01.720
(smooching)
all right. All right!

02:01.722 --> 02:03.155
(grunts) stop!

02:03.157 --> 02:04.356
(laughs)

02:04.358 --> 02:05.224
If you must know,

02:05.226 --> 02:06.792
The presidential fitness test
is tomorrow,

02:06.794 --> 02:11.163
And I'm gonna be the only guy
doing the flexed arm hang
with the girls.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.097
Say no more.

02:12.099 --> 02:14.333
Mama will never, ever
let anything

02:14.335 --> 02:16.168
Remotely uncomfortable
happen to you.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.403
I'll just write you a note
and get you out of it.

02:18.405 --> 02:20.472
For real?
Absolutely.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.940
Absolutely not.

02:21.942 --> 02:25.110
Every kid in america
has to take that test.

02:25.112 --> 02:28.680
Well, what does that
have to do with
my adam? (chuckles)

02:28.682 --> 02:30.916
It's a rite of passage.

02:30.918 --> 02:34.052
You can't get out of
a rite of passage

02:34.054 --> 02:35.454
With a note
from your mom.

02:35.456 --> 02:39.057
Fine! We get it.
I won't write a note.

02:39.392 --> 02:40.759
(sighs)

02:40.761 --> 02:41.460
I'll write you a note.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.896
Seriously?
I'm gonna hug you
so hard right now,

02:43.898 --> 02:46.632
I might break every bone
in your body.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.067
Oh. (laughs)

02:49.069 --> 02:51.170
Oh, come on, adam.
Don't be scared.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.638
You can hug me
harder than that.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.740
Okay.
How does this feel?

02:54.742 --> 02:55.807
(grunting)

02:55.809 --> 02:59.111
Mama will write you
a note. (chuckles)

02:59.245 --> 03:00.445
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

03:00.447 --> 03:04.750
<i>♪ but nonetheless</i>
<i>I feel the need to say</i>

03:06.719 --> 03:07.653
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

03:07.655 --> 03:11.890
<i>♪ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i>clearer every day ♪</i>

03:11.892 --> 03:14.059
<i>It was April 8,</i>
<i>1980-something.</i>

03:14.061 --> 03:15.661
<i>Before e-mail and facetime,</i>

03:15.663 --> 03:16.695
<i>The way to keep in touch</i>
<i>with somebody</i>

03:16.697 --> 03:20.966
<i>Was by sending them</i>
<i>an actual piece of paper</i>
<i>with writing on it!</i>

03:20.968 --> 03:22.901
Are you kidding me?
Where are your pants?

03:22.903 --> 03:24.303
My pen pal will be here
any minute.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.038
Doesn't having a pen pal
come to your house

03:26.040 --> 03:28.106
Defeat the whole purpose
of having a pen pal?

03:28.108 --> 03:30.609
Fanny's just gonna be here
for a few days.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.311
You can suffer through
by wearing bottoms.

03:32.313 --> 03:35.814
And for the love
of all that is holy,
be nice to the girl.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.149
Why wouldn't I
be nice to her?

03:37.151 --> 03:39.251
We speak
the same language.

03:39.253 --> 03:40.085
(imitating speaking french)

03:40.087 --> 03:42.354
Mom, if he doesn't not
wear his pants

03:42.356 --> 03:45.157
And stop speaking
french gibberish,

03:45.159 --> 03:46.592
I will leave this house
forever.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.694
(angrily imitating french)

03:50.997 --> 03:53.699
Come on, ambassador.
Let's get you some pants.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.868
That means nothing!
(sighs)

03:56.870 --> 03:58.604
Whoa! What is this?

03:58.606 --> 04:00.105
Why do you look like
a bigger knob than usual?

04:00.107 --> 04:03.742
'cause I saw that pic
of your sexually charged
french friend,

04:03.744 --> 04:07.346
And I am not letting this
amazing opportunity go
to waste.

04:07.348 --> 04:07.879
Oh, no.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.582
Just because she's french
doesn't mean
she'll make out with you.

04:10.584 --> 04:14.186
(scoffs)
pops: I beg to differ,
actually.

04:14.354 --> 04:15.087
In my experience,

04:15.089 --> 04:18.757
The french  <i>demoiselle</i>
<i>is very adventurous.</i>

04:18.759 --> 04:20.659
What's her name again?
Fanny.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.561
Oh, that's a lay-up.

04:22.563 --> 04:23.595
Score!
Pops!

04:23.597 --> 04:26.231
What? She's named
after a butt.

04:26.233 --> 04:29.434
That's a green light
if I ever saw one.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.103
Erica, I'm gonna
need your help.

04:31.105 --> 04:35.040
Here's a bunch of phrases
I need translated
into her native tongue

04:35.042 --> 04:37.876
So I can get a little
of that native tongue.

04:37.878 --> 04:40.445
"girl, our countries
have been at war too long.

04:40.447 --> 04:43.282
"let's make peace and love
together."

04:43.284 --> 04:44.916
Mmm-hmm.

04:46.686 --> 04:48.453
You know what?
I will help you.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.187
Nice.

04:49.189 --> 04:53.392
I can tell by that smile
we're on the same page.

04:55.161 --> 04:57.462
You're gonna mess
with him, aren't you?

04:57.464 --> 04:58.497
(scoffs) big time.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.498
I don't know how
he doesn't see

04:59.500 --> 05:02.067
That kind of thing coming
by now.

05:02.069 --> 05:02.734
It's very upsetting.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.403
<i>While erica</i>
<i>was scheming against barry,</i>

05:04.405 --> 05:08.840
<i>My mom's scheme to get me</i>
<i>out of gym class</i>
<i>was in motion.</i>

05:08.842 --> 05:12.010
You have osgood-schladder
disease?

05:12.012 --> 05:14.313
Actually,
it's pronounced "schlodder,"

05:14.315 --> 05:15.314
And there's
an article attached.

05:15.316 --> 05:19.718
My hamstrings and ligaments
aren't keeping up
with my bones.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.419
I'm growing too fast.

05:20.421 --> 05:23.088
You're growing too fast?
Where?

05:23.090 --> 05:23.922
It's all in the note.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.390
You really
expect me to believe

05:25.392 --> 05:26.792
Your mother wrote
this note?

05:26.794 --> 05:27.926
Yes, 'cause she actually did.

05:27.928 --> 05:31.330
Son, did you ever see
the movie  <i>red dawn?</i>

05:31.332 --> 05:32.130
(scoffs)
a million times.

05:32.132 --> 05:35.267
Do you love movies?
'cause I love movies.

05:35.269 --> 05:36.501
Let me ask you
a question.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.403
What are you gonna do
when the russki invaders

05:38.405 --> 05:39.471
Storm the suburbs
of philly?

05:39.473 --> 05:41.640
Actually, I think
they'd be more interested

05:41.642 --> 05:43.575
In coastal cities
and financial centers.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.776
You're gonna
have to fight

05:44.778 --> 05:46.912
And use the skills
you learned right here!

05:46.914 --> 05:48.680
Even the pull-up?
Especially the pull-up.

05:48.682 --> 05:52.351
You'll need your upper-arm
strength to bash skulls.

05:52.353 --> 05:54.886
I don't want to
bash skulls.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.322
The kids in  <i>red dawn</i>
<i>didn't want to, either,</i>

05:57.324 --> 06:00.659
But they had to
in order to survive.

06:00.661 --> 06:03.995
So, where are we
with that note?

06:03.997 --> 06:07.532
I just received
an authentic,
bona fide note

06:07.534 --> 06:12.204
From mr. Goldfarb here
saying that he is
physically unable

06:12.206 --> 06:14.773
To complete
the presidential fitness test.

06:14.775 --> 06:20.946
So, I've decided
to push the test one week
until he gets better.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.614
Until then,
we'll be running laps.

06:22.616 --> 06:26.818
(students groan)
mr. Goldfarb will
stand here and watch.

06:26.820 --> 06:31.456
Feel free to wish him
a speedy recovery
in your own way.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.158
All right! Let's go!

06:33.160 --> 06:34.893
Hoof it! Knees high!

06:34.895 --> 06:36.461
(whistle blows)

06:36.463 --> 06:38.797
You're so dead,
goldnerd.

06:39.365 --> 06:40.832
Totally get it.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.367
(sighs)

06:42.735 --> 06:43.368
Hey, ow.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.537
Oh, real nice, lisa.
Real nice.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.739
<i>Meanwhile, erica's pen pal,</i>
<i>fanny, had arrived</i>

06:47.741 --> 06:50.976
<i>And was getting</i>
<i>the grand tour</i>
<i>of the goldberg home.</i>

06:50.978 --> 06:54.579
(speaking french)

06:59.552 --> 07:01.720
<i>Fantastique.</i>
<i>(both laugh)</i>

07:01.722 --> 07:03.288
(crunch)

07:03.890 --> 07:05.624
'sup, fanny?

07:05.892 --> 07:07.392
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

07:07.394 --> 07:09.694
Hunk of
your native bread?

07:13.032 --> 07:15.467
Oh. Barree.  <i>Bonjour.</i>

07:15.469 --> 07:15.934
Hi.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.303
Oh, here.
Use these cards
I translated for you.

07:18.305 --> 07:20.705
Start with this one.
It says,
"welcome to our home.

07:20.707 --> 07:23.175
"it's really nice
to have you here."

07:23.276 --> 07:26.044
(speaking french haltingly)

07:33.419 --> 07:34.986
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
Good stuff. Great start.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.456
Um, I know you want to do
this next one.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.491
It's "how you doing, girl?"

07:45.932 --> 07:46.398
(laughs)

07:46.400 --> 07:50.035
She likes it.
Yeah, it's working.
Don't stop now.

07:57.443 --> 07:58.844
Okay...

07:59.212 --> 08:01.546
It sounded like
I said "gary coleman."

08:01.548 --> 08:02.781
Weird.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.182
Beautiful language.

08:04.184 --> 08:07.185
Good night.
Or should I say...

08:14.494 --> 08:16.628
Let me tell you something,
mr. And mrs. Goldfarb.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.630
There are three things
I hate in life...

08:18.632 --> 08:22.033
My ex-wife,
carrots, and lies.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.202
Okay, why did
I close my store
and rush down here?

08:24.204 --> 08:25.837
Because president reagan
asked me personally

08:25.839 --> 08:30.008
Through a xeroxed letter
to oversee a fitness test
of his design.

08:30.010 --> 08:34.913
And your son tried to
get out of it
with an absurd note...

08:34.915 --> 08:37.249
That no parent
would ever write.

08:37.251 --> 08:39.451
Um...

08:47.860 --> 08:49.361
I wrote the note.

08:49.363 --> 08:49.961
Oh (bleep) me.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.997
It was a ridiculous test,
murray.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.265
Since when
is strength measured

08:53.267 --> 08:55.967
By how many pull-ups
a person can do?

08:55.969 --> 08:57.836
You know
what takes real strength?

08:57.838 --> 08:58.870
Tackling the role
of levi

08:58.872 --> 09:01.706
In  <i>joseph and the amazing</i>
<i>technicolor dreamcoat.</i>

09:01.708 --> 09:02.474
And adam was scrumptious.

09:02.476 --> 09:04.309
There's nothing wrong
with my test, ma'am.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.077
If adam suffers
from anything,

09:06.079 --> 09:07.646
It is from
a far more serious

09:07.648 --> 09:10.682
And permanent condition
called the wuss-bags.

09:10.684 --> 09:14.719
Hey. My son
may be unathletic
and afraid of birds...

09:14.721 --> 09:15.854
He's not afraid
of all birds.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.889
I know, not all birds.
Not all birds.

09:17.891 --> 09:18.823
But he's not a wuss.

09:18.825 --> 09:21.793
Look, I am administering
a test at the direct order

09:21.795 --> 09:24.663
Of the president
of the United States.

09:24.665 --> 09:28.233
If you want adam out of it,
get a note from him.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.901
Then it's settled.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.571
I'll see you back here
on Monday.

09:35.141 --> 09:35.974
What just happened?

09:35.976 --> 09:38.276
She's gonna go get a note
from the president.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.010
<i>Look out, mr. Reagan.</i>

09:39.012 --> 09:41.846
<i>Beverly goldberg's</i>
<i>coming for you.</i>

09:41.848 --> 09:44.416
<i>My mom's mission to</i>
<i>track down the president</i>
<i>had begun.</i>

09:44.418 --> 09:47.018
<i>First stop... Harrisburg,</i>
<i>the state capital.</i>

09:47.020 --> 09:49.888
Hello.
I'm pennsylvania citizen
beverly goldberg,

09:49.890 --> 09:51.056
And I'm here
to speak to the governor.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.325
Um...This is
the comptroller's office.

09:53.327 --> 09:55.660
Great. Then I'll speak to
the comptroller.

09:55.662 --> 09:58.530
Uh, and what does this
pertain to?

09:58.532 --> 10:00.532
The presidential
fitness test.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.000
And the comptroller
can help how?

10:02.002 --> 10:03.635
He can put me in touch
with the governor,

10:03.637 --> 10:05.370
Who can put me in touch
with the president

10:05.372 --> 10:08.373
So I can get my son
out of gym class.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.341
Ah. Question...

10:09.343 --> 10:11.710
Do you have any idea
what a comptroller does?

10:11.712 --> 10:14.779
Of course. He comptrols
the great state
of pennsylvania,

10:14.781 --> 10:18.550
And I need him
to get me to the man
who comptrols america.

10:18.552 --> 10:20.385
Here's a thing...
Uh, "comptrol,"

10:20.387 --> 10:22.587
The way you're using it,
isn't a word.

10:22.589 --> 10:23.888
Yes, it is.
No. No, it's not.

10:23.890 --> 10:24.856
It is.
Not really.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.257
Yeah, it is.
Definitely not a word...

10:26.259 --> 10:29.294
Straight-up not a word.
Uh, but I get the sense
you're not gonna leave,

10:29.296 --> 10:32.497
So here's
what I'm gonna do.

10:32.499 --> 10:35.634
There's a guy in
the state assembly's office

10:35.636 --> 10:37.168
Who screwed over
my sister.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.838
I think
he should meet you.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.006
Sound good?
Sounds great.

10:41.008 --> 10:44.075
Now, I'm just gonna
write down these directions,

10:44.077 --> 10:46.911
And when you see him,
just tell him,

10:46.913 --> 10:48.346
"jill's brother
says hi."

10:48.348 --> 10:51.549
Thank you for taking comptrol
of the situation.

10:51.551 --> 10:52.350
Not a word.
Yes, it is.

10:52.352 --> 10:55.820
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>my brother was working on</i>
<i>his french connection.</i>

10:55.822 --> 10:58.490
Good morning,
<i>mon cherie.</i>

10:58.492 --> 11:00.291
Hello, barree.
Hi.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.626
Getting into this
right away, huh, barry?

11:01.628 --> 11:06.865
What? I'm just showing her
a traditional american
breakfast.

11:06.999 --> 11:11.169
(over-enunciating) fanny,
this is called a pop-tart.

11:11.171 --> 11:16.307
In america, we eat our fruit
inside bread...

11:16.309 --> 11:18.510
For you.
<i>Merci.</i>

11:18.512 --> 11:22.480
You know what else
goes down easy
in the morning?

11:23.683 --> 11:24.482
Rap music.

11:24.484 --> 11:28.286
Erica, you translated
my masterpiece, right?

11:28.288 --> 11:29.821
Every word.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.824
It's called  <i>"mon lit."</i>

11:32.826 --> 11:35.593
It means "my bed."

11:35.928 --> 11:38.096
(cassette deck clicks)

11:39.198 --> 11:41.733
(mid-tempo beat plays)

11:42.334 --> 11:45.570
(rapping in french)

12:05.224 --> 12:08.760
Enough. I'm sorry.
I have to stop this.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.161
It's too far.

12:10.163 --> 12:10.895
You speak french?

12:10.897 --> 12:12.797
How many times
do I have to
tell you this?

12:12.799 --> 12:17.302
I was in the war.
I helped liberate France.

12:17.304 --> 12:17.936
That was real?

12:17.938 --> 12:19.137
I'm confused.
What's happening?

12:19.139 --> 12:22.607
The song...
It's about peeing
in your bed.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.676
That wasn't
your intention, right?

12:24.678 --> 12:26.044
No! No.

12:26.046 --> 12:31.449
(both laugh)
it had the word "pee-pee"
in it, like, a lot.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.417
(both laugh)

12:32.419 --> 12:33.218
What the hell, erica?

12:33.220 --> 12:35.920
I asked you for your help,
and you made a fool of me?

12:35.922 --> 12:37.322
I told you
not to hit on my friend.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.357
I mean,
did you actually think
you had a chance with her?

12:39.359 --> 12:42.727
I don't know!
I mean, the girls here
don't get me at all,

12:42.729 --> 12:46.030
So I thought someone
from another country might.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.000
Now you ruined that, too.

12:50.069 --> 12:52.170
<i>While barry</i>
<i>had lost faith in romance,</i>

12:52.172 --> 12:53.538
<i>I still had faith</i>
<i>in my mom.</i>

12:53.540 --> 12:57.275
Has mom come back
from the president's
house yet?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.077
Are you kidding? No.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.678
Have you checked
the answering machine?

13:00.680 --> 13:02.947
Maybe mr. Reagan
left a message or something.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.116
You know, the president's
a very busy man.

13:05.118 --> 13:09.387
He might not have time
to help one little boy
get out of gym class.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.455
He likes jelly beans.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.724
No, no,
he's got a fun side,

13:12.726 --> 13:14.259
But I think you might
want to consider

13:14.261 --> 13:16.628
That your mom's not gonna
come through on this.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.196
I know
it's a bit of a long shot,

13:18.198 --> 13:19.798
But she's never
let me down before.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.599
<i>And then something happened</i>
<i>more surprising</i>

13:21.601 --> 13:24.135
<i>Than my mom getting a note</i>
<i>from the president.</i>

13:24.137 --> 13:25.570
Come here, buddy.
I want to talk to you.

13:25.572 --> 13:29.541
<i>My dad decided</i>
<i>to open up to me.</i>

13:31.210 --> 13:34.479
You know why I really
want you to take this test?

13:34.481 --> 13:36.681
You need an outlet
for your hostility?

13:36.683 --> 13:39.584
No!
Stop aggravating me!

13:39.586 --> 13:41.853
I'm trying
to help you here, man.

13:41.855 --> 13:44.622
Okay, I'm gonna
tell you something

13:44.624 --> 13:46.991
Your brother and sister
don't know.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.560
I played a lot of sports
in high school,

13:48.562 --> 13:52.163
But there was one thing
I could never do... Swim.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.164
What?
Yeah.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.332
I grew up in the city.
Where would I learn?

13:54.334 --> 13:56.501
Well, you could
take the bus
to the beach,

13:56.503 --> 13:57.635
Or there's summer camps.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.671
The ymca
has a very nice program.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.340
How about I talk,
you listen?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.375
I tried everything
in my power

14:04.377 --> 14:05.376
To get out of
that swim class

14:05.378 --> 14:07.312
'cause I knew
if I got in the pool,

14:07.314 --> 14:08.880
I'd humiliate myself
in front of everybody.

14:08.882 --> 14:12.650
So, what did you do?
I got in
that damn pool!

14:12.652 --> 14:13.918
At first,
I was embarrassed,

14:13.920 --> 14:15.220
But by the end
of the semester,

14:15.222 --> 14:18.089
I... I developed
quite a mean backstroke.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.858
Really?
Yeah!

14:19.860 --> 14:23.228
You don't have to be
the best.

14:23.295 --> 14:25.096
You just got to try.

14:25.098 --> 14:28.099
Well, since you
were an athlete
back in the day,

14:28.101 --> 14:30.168
Maybe you could help me
with my pull-ups.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.570
Let's get to work.
Come on!

14:32.572 --> 14:35.206
<i>(eye of the tiger</i> plays)

14:37.476 --> 14:39.377

14:44.817 --> 14:46.284

14:46.286 --> 14:47.085
Let's do this.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.153
<i>(eye of the tiger</i> stops)
I did it.

14:49.155 --> 14:51.723
I got a note
from the president

14:51.725 --> 14:54.158
Of the United States
of america.

14:54.160 --> 14:54.893
Huh?
Huh?

14:54.895 --> 14:56.261
Actually, it's from
the secretary

14:56.263 --> 14:57.996
To the undersecretary
to the president,

14:57.998 --> 15:01.532
Who's the best friend of
the lieutenant governor's
cousin

15:01.534 --> 15:02.734
Who just wanted to
get me out of the office,

15:02.736 --> 15:07.105
But it's got
the presidential seal,
so it's official.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.107
Wow. But no.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.308
Adam and I
just had a talk,

15:10.310 --> 15:13.645
And he understands
the importance
of just trying.

15:13.647 --> 15:15.780
I'll take the note!
I'll take the note.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.548
(sighs)
mom, you're the best.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.817
I'll see you
around the tv sometime.

15:20.619 --> 15:21.386
<i>And, just like that,</i>

15:21.388 --> 15:25.223
<i>I had a presidential pardon</i>
<i>from fitness.</i>

15:26.725 --> 15:28.426
Fanny just left
for the airport.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.095
You didn't
want to say goodbye?

15:31.097 --> 15:31.796
What's the point?

15:31.798 --> 15:35.166
She thinks
I'm a bed-wetting loser,
thanks to you.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.535
Actually,
I don't think she does.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.204
Look,
she left you this note.

15:42.308 --> 15:45.243
Oh, no!
I don't read french!

15:45.245 --> 15:47.745
Right. But I do.

15:50.082 --> 15:53.284

15:57.357 --> 15:58.957
"nun chucking, and frisbee."

15:58.959 --> 16:00.658
She knows about
my frisbee skills?

16:00.660 --> 16:03.361
Did she write
about the sketch I gave her
of us riding a dolphin?

16:03.363 --> 16:07.498
No. But she did say
if you're ever in paris,
look her up.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.468
Does it really say that?
Yes.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.674
It does.
It really does.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.309
Looks like she was
into you, kiddo.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.813
I'm not surprised.
I'm irresistible.

Hey.

16:23.249 --> 16:25.583
This is a thank-you note
to your parents.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.552
Well, I felt sorry
for the big dope.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.587
No, you care about him.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.055
Maybe a little.

16:31.057 --> 16:32.123
Well, it was
a nice thing to do.

16:32.125 --> 16:35.660

I know what I said.

17:07.559 --> 17:08.860
But I lied.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.863
I cut that class,
and I... I never learned how.

17:11.865 --> 17:14.232

<i>to paris, France.</i>

19:28.067 --> 19:30.668
Barry: Wait...
Hold the plane!

19:30.670 --> 19:32.036
Fanny!

19:32.038 --> 19:33.504
Fanny.

19:35.207 --> 19:39.343
Shh. Stop telling me
you love me.

19:39.444 --> 19:40.278
It's not meant to be.

19:40.280 --> 19:45.550
I have to stay here
and become an american
sports and music icon.

19:45.552 --> 19:48.553
But we'll always have
pop-tarts, fanny.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.794
We'll always
have pop-tarts.

20:02.234 --> 20:04.168
She kissed me.

20:04.836 --> 20:06.304
Twice.

20:06.672 --> 20:09.040
Two french kisses.

20:14.980 --> 20:15.446
Whoo!

20:15.448 --> 20:17.582
<i>♪ eye of the tiger</i>
<i>it's the thrill of the fight</i>

20:17.584 --> 20:18.950
<i>♪ rising up to the challenge</i>
<i>of our rival</i>

20:18.952 --> 20:21.385
(grunts)
okay, that's enough.
No more.

20:21.387 --> 20:24.021
I like his little
baby arms.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.323
I'm gonna
chew on those arms!

20:25.325 --> 20:26.257
Oh!
Tickle, tickle!

20:26.259 --> 20:28.659
Will you stop it?
What do you do that for?

20:28.661 --> 20:29.327
I love him so much.

20:29.329 --> 20:32.964
Okay, I tackled my fear.
Now it's your turn.

20:33.365 --> 20:35.266
(grunting)

20:35.268 --> 20:36.634
Kick. Kick.
Use your legs.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.769
I'm kicking.
See, you're doing it.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.037
I'm doing it!
Keep on going.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.639
All right.
(grunts)

20:41.641 --> 20:44.075
Come on,
give it all you got.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.610
Come on.
A little bit.

20:45.612 --> 20:46.844
Yes! Whoo!

20:46.846 --> 20:48.879
(both laugh)

21:02.361 --> 21:04.061
Has anyone seen my car?

21:04.063 --> 21:05.863
I know the sign says
you can't park there,

21:05.865 --> 21:09.267
But it's okay
'cause I'm in love.

21:22.214 --> 21:25.149
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

21:25.151 --> 21:26.751
(thud)
