00:18.734 --> 00:20.985
Hi everyone, here's
your homegirl, Nikki.

00:20.987 --> 00:24.279
I'm back to show you this
amazing eye tutorial today.

00:24.281 --> 00:25.363
(bells chime)

00:25.365 --> 00:26.532
What I like to do is always

00:26.534 --> 00:29.076
use my amazing
color design palate.

00:29.078 --> 00:31.203
And we're gonna work our way

00:31.205 --> 00:32.996
all the way out to the side,

00:32.998 --> 00:36.917
make sure you have
full coverage, gorge.

00:36.919 --> 00:39.587
Oh my god, do you see
how pretty that looks?

00:39.589 --> 00:41.172
Pretty!

00:41.174 --> 00:42.882
Now we're gonna take it to
our little stunted brush.

00:42.884 --> 00:44.050
This is what I like to call it

00:44.052 --> 00:45.510
because it has
shorter bristles here,

00:45.512 --> 00:47.761
so it's better for
the contouring.

00:47.763 --> 00:51.099
Work it, work, work.

00:51.101 --> 00:52.642
(bells chime)

00:52.644 --> 00:55.645
Fabulous, and we're gonna
move over to our mascara

00:55.647 --> 00:56.770
which is our final touch,

00:56.772 --> 00:59.358
and I like to use NYC Sky Rise.

01:00.776 --> 01:04.405
And yeah, we're just gonna
get started on our mascara.

01:05.489 --> 01:07.448
And I love to start at the base,

01:07.450 --> 01:09.367
and move my way inside.

01:09.369 --> 01:11.284
So we're gonna just start here.

01:59.961 --> 02:00.837
All right.

02:03.339 --> 02:05.005

02:05.007 --> 02:09.008
Yeah, it's almost time,
she'll be here soon.

02:09.011 --> 02:11.806
(computer dings)

02:17.269 --> 02:21.398
Now, you're not gonna show
this to anyone, right?

02:27.529 --> 02:28.363
Right?

02:31.910 --> 02:36.120
I mean, it's not like
you haven't done it, too.

02:36.122 --> 02:38.874

02:47.884 --> 02:50.300
[Man] Now you better
remind the musicians

02:50.302 --> 02:52.552
that we expect them
to be there at 7:30,

02:52.554 --> 02:54.222
the dinner start
promptly at eight.

02:54.224 --> 02:55.723
[Woman] Yes, sir.

02:55.725 --> 02:57.224
[Man] Oh, be sure and
check with the florist too.

02:57.226 --> 02:58.475
[Woman] Yes, sir.

02:58.477 --> 02:59.560
Now I want you
to follow through

02:59.562 --> 03:00.812
on every single detail.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.062
It's a very important affair.

03:02.064 --> 03:03.730
I don't want
anything to go wrong.

03:03.732 --> 03:06.943
Now don't you worry, just
leave everything to me.

03:06.945 --> 03:08.568

03:17.705 --> 03:20.666

03:23.378 --> 03:25.586
[Man] She bought herself
one of there new evening gowns

03:25.588 --> 03:27.295
with a mini skirt.

03:27.297 --> 03:29.465
[Woman] Oh, how'd she look?

03:29.467 --> 03:30.633
[Man] Grotesque

03:30.635 --> 03:33.513
(audience laughs)

03:36.266 --> 03:37.140
She was seven feet tall.

03:37.142 --> 03:40.852
(audience laughs)

03:40.854 --> 03:42.103
[Woman] Well, is
there anything else

03:42.105 --> 03:43.604
that you want me
to take care of?

03:43.606 --> 03:45.939
Oh no, if any
emergencies come up,

03:45.941 --> 03:49.193
I'm afraid I'm gonna ask you
to give up your lunch hour.

03:49.195 --> 03:50.110
That's quite all right, sir,

03:50.112 --> 03:51.445
anything to help out sir.

03:51.447 --> 03:53.239
Well, I'm scheduled to
pick up Mr. Hellerington

03:53.241 --> 03:54.907

09:59.690 --> 10:01.900
(retches)

10:06.865 --> 10:07.824
I had to.

10:09.492 --> 10:10.367
You knew.

(computer beeps)

11:42.084 --> 11:45.546
(foreboding piano music)

11:51.051 --> 11:52.719
I'm sorry Claire,
but I need the weekend

11:52.721 --> 11:54.928
to make my deadline.

11:54.930 --> 11:57.306
I'll take Amy next week.

11:57.308 --> 12:01.438
Look, just tell her I love
her and I'll call her later.

12:02.856 --> 12:03.732
Okay,

12:05.400 --> 12:07.023
okay, bye.

12:07.025 --> 12:09.570
(phone beeps)

12:15.367 --> 12:17.534
Hey, Matt, wait a sec.

12:17.536 --> 12:19.578
They left your mail
in my box again.

12:19.580 --> 12:20.955
Sorry Henry, I'll
call the post office

12:20.957 --> 12:22.206
first thing in the morning.

12:22.208 --> 12:25.000
No worries, big
storm coming in.

12:25.002 --> 12:26.836
Better stay in tonight.

12:26.838 --> 12:28.462
I got a lot of
work ahead of me.

12:28.464 --> 12:29.922
Good night, Henry.

12:29.924 --> 12:31.466
Night.

12:31.468 --> 12:32.674
(slow ominous music)

12:32.676 --> 12:33.967
There's a severe
weather advisory

12:33.969 --> 12:35.552
for the next 24 hours.

12:35.554 --> 12:37.971
Expect 25 to 30
centimeters overnight

12:37.973 --> 12:40.807
with freezing rain to
cap the morning commute.

12:40.809 --> 12:42.434
It's gonna be a long cold night

12:42.436 --> 12:44.979
with temperatures
dropping to minus 18

12:44.981 --> 12:46.230
with the windchill making it

12:46.232 --> 12:49.232
a bone-numbing minus 35 degrees.

12:49.234 --> 12:52.653
Folks, this is a nearly unprecedented
extreme weather event.

12:52.655 --> 12:55.280
The last winter storm of
this magnitude on record

12:55.282 --> 12:58.076
was the Great White
Crush of 1978.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.951
Will tonight's storm
top those numbers?

12:59.953 --> 13:01.578
We'll keep up posted.

13:01.580 --> 13:04.123
So stay in keep
warm and get rested,

13:04.125 --> 13:06.918
'cause tomorrow you're
gonna have to dig out.

13:06.920 --> 13:07.835
Back to you, Rick.

13:07.837 --> 13:09.336
(unsettling piano music)

13:09.338 --> 13:12.381
Thanks Bill, okay, speaking
of the Great White Crush,

13:12.383 --> 13:15.009
do you remember what you were
doing 30 years ago today?

13:15.011 --> 13:15.927
I know I sure do.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.223
I was helping dear old dad.

13:35.740 --> 13:37.365
(wind howls)

13:37.367 --> 13:38.198
(computer beeps)

13:38.200 --> 13:40.118
(TV hisses)

13:40.120 --> 13:41.328
[Matt] What?

13:56.468 --> 13:59.387
(glass clinks)

13:59.389 --> 14:01.766
(TV hisses)

14:29.585 --> 14:33.130
(suspenseful piano music)

15:01.617 --> 15:02.451
Hello?

15:06.122 --> 15:08.623
My God, what the fuck?

15:08.625 --> 15:09.749
How're you doing this?

15:09.751 --> 15:10.582
Me?

15:10.584 --> 15:11.793
You're the sick pervert.

15:11.795 --> 15:13.001
Whoa, pervert?

15:13.003 --> 15:14.669
I don't know how
this is happening.

15:14.671 --> 15:16.254
I just woke up and
there you were.

15:16.256 --> 15:17.756
Maybe it's the storm,

15:17.758 --> 15:19.801
the power must've went out.

15:19.803 --> 15:22.010
I guess our signals got crossed.

15:22.012 --> 15:24.514
Did you lose your power too?

15:24.516 --> 15:26.974
Yeah, for a second.

15:26.976 --> 15:29.184
It's okay, relax.

15:29.186 --> 15:31.730
Don't worry, I can't hurt you.

15:42.032 --> 15:45.077
(slow uneasy music)

15:51.834 --> 15:53.668
Look, this isn't
funny anymore.

15:53.670 --> 15:55.378
I wanna know how
you're doing this.

15:55.380 --> 15:56.671
I'm not, I swear.

15:56.673 --> 15:59.131
Look, my name's Matt
Reed and I live here

15:59.133 --> 16:01.009
at 144 Dunfield Court.

16:02.178 --> 16:03.635
And I'm not spying on you.

16:03.637 --> 16:05.471
Wait, what?

16:05.473 --> 16:07.014
I'm not spying on you.

16:07.016 --> 16:09.767
No, your address, what did
you say your address was?

16:09.769 --> 16:11.563
144 Dunfield Court.

16:12.396 --> 16:13.855
(slow uneasy music)

16:13.857 --> 16:15.856
Impossible, no.

16:15.858 --> 16:17.524
You live here too, don't you?

16:17.526 --> 16:19.568
Why are you doing this to me?

16:19.570 --> 16:20.653
What's the date?

16:20.655 --> 16:21.486
What?

16:21.488 --> 16:22.363
The date?

16:22.365 --> 16:24.197
February 21.

16:24.199 --> 16:25.533
The year?

16:25.535 --> 16:26.410
1978.

16:27.996 --> 16:28.872
Why?

16:29.789 --> 16:31.413
'Kay, look.

16:31.415 --> 16:33.416
It's gonna sound really crazy,

16:33.418 --> 16:35.668
I'm in your apartment right now.

16:35.670 --> 16:37.586
What, you're upstairs?

16:37.588 --> 16:39.629
But not in 1978.

16:39.631 --> 16:40.507
I'm in my,

16:42.385 --> 16:46.056
well, I'm in our apartment
in the year 2008.

16:47.181 --> 16:48.057
Right.

16:49.059 --> 16:51.808
Okay, then, you're nuts.

16:51.810 --> 16:52.726
Goodbye.

16:52.728 --> 16:53.727
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

16:53.729 --> 16:55.104
Don't switch it off.

16:55.106 --> 16:56.399
I can prove it.

16:57.983 --> 16:59.276
I'm listening.

17:03.030 --> 17:03.863
(phone beeps)

17:03.865 --> 17:05.239
What's your name?

17:05.241 --> 17:06.740
What are you doing?

17:06.742 --> 17:08.992
[Matt] Recording
our conversation.

17:08.993 --> 17:10.412
What's your name?

17:12.415 --> 17:13.247
Justine.

17:13.249 --> 17:15.749
(phone beeps)

17:15.751 --> 17:16.750
[Matt] What's your name?

17:16.752 --> 17:18.044
[Justine] What are you doing?

17:18.046 --> 17:19.377
[Matt] Recording
our conversation.

17:19.378 --> 17:20.799
What's your name?

17:22.300 --> 17:23.175
Justine.

17:26.096 --> 17:28.765
Okay, that was pretty damn cool.

17:30.099 --> 17:32.557
If you're really
from the future,

17:32.559 --> 17:34.644
then I'm gonna need proof.

17:34.646 --> 17:36.770
Nobody's gonna believe me.

17:36.772 --> 17:39.856
I can hardly believe it myself.

17:39.858 --> 17:41.608
I'm gonna get my camera,

17:41.610 --> 17:43.070
back in a minute.

17:46.031 --> 17:47.531
It's in here somewhere.

17:47.533 --> 17:50.828
(haunting piano music)

17:57.126 --> 18:00.296
(computer keys click)

18:01.463 --> 18:03.258
[Justine] Found it.

18:08.303 --> 18:09.261
What's that?

18:09.263 --> 18:10.596
It's a computer.

18:10.598 --> 18:13.432
Of course, it's the future.

18:13.434 --> 18:17.355
[Matt] Well, everything's
smaller now-a-days.

18:21.818 --> 18:25.905
I've got to show this
to my professor tomorrow.

18:28.073 --> 18:28.949
Wanna see?

18:34.289 --> 18:38.501
(moves into mid-tempo
uneasy music)

18:48.470 --> 18:51.345
So, how did you get the photo?

18:51.347 --> 18:53.431
[Matt] It was
in my mail today.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.223
Yeah, but who sent it to you?

18:55.225 --> 18:57.894
[Matt] There was
no return address.

18:57.896 --> 18:59.186
Maybe you sent it to me.

18:59.188 --> 19:00.645
[Justine] Why would I do that?

19:00.647 --> 19:04.526
I don't know, to prove
this really happened?

19:07.821 --> 19:09.696
Maybe it's the storm.

19:09.698 --> 19:11.324
It's been snowing
here for hours.

19:11.326 --> 19:12.866
Here, too.

19:12.868 --> 19:14.117
That's it.

19:14.119 --> 19:16.537
That's probably what's
fucked everything up.

19:16.539 --> 19:17.954
I think.

19:17.956 --> 19:20.415
You have no idea what
you're talking about, do you?

19:20.417 --> 19:21.877
No, not a clue.

19:25.714 --> 19:27.632
You're a student, aren't you?

19:27.634 --> 19:30.175
Yeah, fourth year law.

19:30.177 --> 19:34.390
Hey, do you wanna know
what you're doing in '08?

19:35.724 --> 19:37.349
What do you mean?

19:37.351 --> 19:38.558
[Matt] I could type your name

19:38.560 --> 19:40.060
into a search engine
on the internet,

19:40.062 --> 19:42.355
and I could tell you what
you've done in your life.

19:42.357 --> 19:44.231
The internet?

19:44.233 --> 19:45.400
What's that?

19:45.402 --> 19:47.567
It's way too
difficult to explain.

19:47.569 --> 19:50.738
Anyway, you're gonna
be a lawyer, right?

19:50.740 --> 19:53.240
I can probably tell you
exactly what law firm

19:53.242 --> 19:55.701
you're working for right now.

19:55.703 --> 19:57.912
What's your last name?

19:57.914 --> 19:59.997
I don't know if I
really wanna know.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.585
Come on, how bad could it be?

20:04.044 --> 20:09.591
All right, Justine Townsend.

20:14.681 --> 20:15.596
Well?

20:15.598 --> 20:18.098
One second, hold on.

20:18.100 --> 20:20.768
See the problem with the
net is how big it is,

20:20.770 --> 20:22.561
and there's millions
of possibilities.

20:22.563 --> 20:25.940
There could be a dozen people
with the same name as you.

20:25.942 --> 20:29.568
Maybe you got married
and changed your name.

20:29.570 --> 20:33.196
Are you dating anyone
now, or engaged?

20:33.198 --> 20:36.659
No, I just got out of a
really bad relationship.

20:36.661 --> 20:37.703
Oh, sorry.

20:38.663 --> 20:39.996
That's all right.

20:39.998 --> 20:43.960
I'm gonna get more wine,
then I'm gonna go pee.

20:56.806 --> 20:59.809
(slow gloomy music)

21:01.394 --> 21:02.436
Oh my god.

21:09.903 --> 21:13.198
(tense sinister music)

21:25.292 --> 21:28.670
(loud foreboding music)

21:34.010 --> 21:34.844
Justine!

21:36.930 --> 21:37.970
[Justine] So what
did you find out?

21:37.972 --> 21:39.430
Am I a lawyer?

21:39.432 --> 21:40.681
Am I married?

21:40.683 --> 21:42.266
Justine, you've
gotta get outta there!

21:42.268 --> 21:43.476
[Justine] I'm rich.

21:43.478 --> 21:44.309
[Matt] There's someone
inside your house.

21:44.311 --> 21:45.519
He's gonna kill you!

21:45.521 --> 21:47.145
You have to run for it!

21:47.147 --> 21:48.855
Matt, what's wrong?

21:48.857 --> 21:51.275
Justine, get out of there!

21:51.277 --> 21:52.109
He's in the closet behind you!

21:52.111 --> 21:53.987
Just get out of there!

21:55.365 --> 21:56.241
Get out!

22:00.161 --> 22:02.038
Get out, just go, run!

22:04.124 --> 22:04.955
Oh, fuck!

22:04.957 --> 22:05.789
(Justine screams)

22:05.791 --> 22:06.624
Fuck!

22:06.626 --> 22:08.667
(metal clanks)

22:08.669 --> 22:10.169
(Justine screams)

22:10.171 --> 22:11.047
Justine!

22:12.840 --> 22:14.132
Run, Justine!

22:14.134 --> 22:15.260
Run, just go!

22:17.220 --> 22:19.136
Oh God, Justine,
please don't hurt her!

22:19.138 --> 22:20.054
Don't do this!

22:20.056 --> 22:21.305
Just let her go,

22:21.307 --> 22:23.223
she didn't do anything
to you, leave her alone!

22:23.225 --> 22:25.183
Why are you doing this
to her, you sick fuck?

22:25.185 --> 22:26.562
Just let her go!

22:27.605 --> 22:31.231
(moves into slow haunting music)

22:31.233 --> 22:33.235
[Justine] Oh God, no.

22:34.404 --> 22:35.238
Matt.

22:37.741 --> 22:38.575
No!

22:39.492 --> 22:40.324
(Justine thuds)

22:40.326 --> 22:42.746
(Matt thuds)

22:44.539 --> 22:45.790
Hello, Henry.

22:48.334 --> 22:50.545
How do you know my name?

22:52.422 --> 22:54.087
Where are you?

22:54.089 --> 22:57.633
I guess I haven't aged
as gracefully as I thought.

22:57.635 --> 22:59.679
I'm you, Henry Wilkinson.

23:01.056 --> 23:03.346
What the fuck are
you talking about?

23:03.348 --> 23:04.224
You're me?

23:06.603 --> 23:07.979
Did you do this?

23:09.646 --> 23:12.355
I didn't believe it myself.

23:12.357 --> 23:14.232
I thought it was crazy,

23:14.234 --> 23:16.277
but I had to find out for sure.

23:16.279 --> 23:18.738
That's why I bought this house.

23:18.740 --> 23:21.949
That's why you
bought this house.

23:21.951 --> 23:24.245
I'm you, 30 years from now.

23:27.081 --> 23:29.790
I don't know where
you are right now,

23:29.792 --> 23:32.544
but when I find
you, you're dead.

23:34.254 --> 23:35.462
No, wait!

23:35.464 --> 23:38.633
No, no, you gotta hear me out.

23:38.635 --> 23:40.345
I can prove I'm you.

23:42.847 --> 23:45.141
Jenny Harlow, remember her?

23:48.685 --> 23:50.646
Who the fuck are you?

23:51.981 --> 23:56.150
Jenny Harlow lived
across the street from me,

23:56.152 --> 23:58.321
from you, when we were 12.

24:01.323 --> 24:03.200
We had a crush on her,

24:04.077 --> 24:05.992
but she never talked to us.

24:05.994 --> 24:07.744
How do you know this?

24:07.746 --> 24:09.163
Well, 'cause I was there.

24:09.165 --> 24:09.999
I'm you.

24:12.751 --> 24:15.169
I was the one who climbed
through the window

24:15.171 --> 24:16.671
every night for a week,

24:16.673 --> 24:17.507
kill her.

24:19.425 --> 24:20.717
Hiding under her bed,

24:20.719 --> 24:21.845
you kill her.

24:23.887 --> 24:25.011
In her closet,

24:25.013 --> 24:25.889
kill her.

24:31.812 --> 24:33.438
Remember?

24:33.440 --> 24:34.730
Watching her fall asleep.

24:34.732 --> 24:36.358
Mm, that's right.

24:38.153 --> 24:40.027
And then sneaking out,

24:40.029 --> 24:42.864
and caressing her cheek,

24:42.866 --> 24:43.950
her bare leg.

24:45.117 --> 24:46.075
She looked so...

24:46.077 --> 24:49.369
So, so peaceful, so beautiful.

24:49.371 --> 24:51.873
Hm, and then that last night,

24:51.875 --> 24:55.250
when we got dad's hunting
knife and stood over her.

24:55.252 --> 24:56.128
Her leg,

25:00.300 --> 25:01.175
kill her.

25:04.095 --> 25:04.971
Fuck,

25:06.848 --> 25:08.640
but I couldn't do it.

25:09.768 --> 25:11.893
I wanted to, but
I couldn't do it.

25:11.895 --> 25:13.810
That's right,
we didn't give in.

25:13.812 --> 25:15.064
We walked away.

25:18.568 --> 25:20.609
But not anymore.

25:20.611 --> 25:22.111
What do you want from me?

25:22.113 --> 25:24.696
Look, I've thought about
tonight for a long time.

25:24.698 --> 25:28.116
This is happening for a reason.

25:28.118 --> 25:30.286
We've got a second chance
to do things right.

25:30.288 --> 25:31.328
Don't kill her, Henry.

25:31.330 --> 25:32.163
What?

25:32.165 --> 25:32.997
Leave.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.624
I just watched you.

25:34.626 --> 25:36.750
I watched me kill him.

25:36.752 --> 25:37.585
Him?

25:37.587 --> 25:39.170
Oh, he had to die.

25:39.172 --> 25:42.173
He was a nagging loose
end for 30 years.

25:42.175 --> 25:44.133
Anyway, he saw us kill her.

25:44.135 --> 25:47.260
But I'm tired, Henry,
the guilt it's too much.

25:47.262 --> 25:49.933
It's too much, I want it to end.

25:51.267 --> 25:53.893
I should have
never let it start.

25:53.895 --> 25:56.314
So I just walk away, again?

25:57.523 --> 25:58.605
Remember Jenny?

25:58.607 --> 26:00.691
Well, we did it then.

26:00.693 --> 26:03.318
If you do this, it changes
everything forever,

26:03.320 --> 26:04.778
and it's a lonely life.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.907
It's too late, old man.

26:08.076 --> 26:12.119
I want this, I want this
too much to just leave.

26:12.121 --> 26:15.082
Fine, then you
better do as I say

26:16.459 --> 26:18.459
because it's a miracle we
were never caught after,

26:18.461 --> 26:20.627
made quite a mess of the place.

26:20.629 --> 26:21.628
(slow unsettling music)

26:21.630 --> 26:24.589
All right, you're the expert.

26:24.591 --> 26:25.465
(Justine screams)

26:25.467 --> 26:28.679
(dark menacing music)

26:32.183 --> 26:33.724
No, no!

26:33.726 --> 26:34.558
This isn't supposed to be...

26:34.560 --> 26:36.685
(Justine screams)

26:36.687 --> 26:37.519
...happening!

26:37.521 --> 26:38.354
(Justine screams)

26:38.356 --> 26:39.188
Don't, no.

26:39.190 --> 26:40.021
(Justine screams)

26:40.023 --> 26:42.775
(Henry coughs)

26:42.777 --> 26:45.655
(Justine screams)

26:47.197 --> 26:49.575
(TV hisses)

26:53.328 --> 26:56.582
(reserved piano music)

27:30.407 --> 27:33.035
(Justine sobs)

27:49.886 --> 27:52.761
[Operator] Operator,
can I help you?

27:52.763 --> 27:55.390
This is the operator,
can I help you?

27:55.392 --> 27:58.393
Hello, is there
anyone on the line?

27:58.395 --> 27:59.559
[Radio Announcer] I know
everyone's been talking

27:59.561 --> 28:01.311
about the Great
White Crush of '78,

28:01.313 --> 28:03.647
but what freaks me out
is that it's 30 years

28:03.649 --> 28:05.274
to the day of that storm.

28:05.276 --> 28:06.983
Some of you will
remember that night,

28:06.985 --> 28:07.818
I know I.

28:07.820 --> 28:10.406
(radio clicks)

28:24.546 --> 28:26.131
Come on, sweetie.

28:28.925 --> 28:30.674
Oh Amy, can you take
this in to your mom?

28:30.676 --> 28:31.886
Okay, daddy.

28:35.264 --> 28:36.598
Thanks, honey.

28:50.155 --> 28:51.945
Hi, can I help you?

28:51.947 --> 28:52.948
What's this?

28:55.993 --> 28:56.869
That's me.

28:58.120 --> 28:58.954
Today?

29:00.498 --> 29:02.459
Where did you get this?

29:04.918 --> 29:05.961
Thank you.

29:11.425 --> 29:12.468
Excuse me.

29:15.012 --> 29:16.889
Do we know each other?

29:19.809 --> 29:21.101
No, we don't.

29:54.260 --> 29:57.345
(computer beeps)

29:57.347 --> 30:00.347
(computer dings)

30:00.349 --> 30:02.182
(computer beeps)

30:02.184 --> 30:05.646
(frantic chilling music)

30:09.858 --> 30:11.858
I'm telling you guys,

30:11.860 --> 30:15.695
18 months and we'll
be making six figures.

30:15.697 --> 30:18.199
That's rather optimistic,
don't you think?

30:18.201 --> 30:21.368
Yeah, look, that's
how these startups work.

30:21.370 --> 30:22.702
It's boom or bust.

30:22.704 --> 30:24.163
And I'm telling you,

30:24.165 --> 30:26.999
I have a really good
feeling about these guys.

30:27.001 --> 30:28.041
They're gonna deliver.

30:28.043 --> 30:30.001
Yeah, well, they better.

30:30.003 --> 30:33.297
I just left a job at
Trademill for this.

30:33.299 --> 30:34.840
You left shit.

30:34.842 --> 30:35.926
He's right.

30:36.927 --> 30:38.094
And what do you know?

30:38.096 --> 30:39.929
Startups are the future.

30:39.931 --> 30:42.890
Get rich by 35, and enjoy
it when you can, baby.

30:42.892 --> 30:44.182
That's right.

30:44.184 --> 30:45.393
If you say YOLO,
I swear to God,

30:45.395 --> 30:48.064
I'm gonna punch you in the face.

30:49.941 --> 30:52.692
Time to start
making an impression.

30:52.694 --> 30:54.652
Dolla, dolla bills, yo.

30:54.654 --> 30:55.530
Don't.

30:59.367 --> 31:00.575
Ladies and gentlemen,

31:00.577 --> 31:02.451
I hope your first few
days at Impact Financial

31:02.453 --> 31:05.872
has been an exciting
experience for you, I truly do.

31:05.874 --> 31:07.373
What we like to do with
our new recruits is,

31:07.375 --> 31:09.959
we like to have a
day of team building.

31:09.961 --> 31:11.461
I know it's Saturday tomorrow,

31:11.463 --> 31:13.128
but what I'd like to do
is get us out of the city,

31:13.130 --> 31:15.506
out into the open air.

31:15.508 --> 31:17.258
So tomorrow's a big day for you,

31:17.260 --> 31:18.759
for all of us, really,

31:18.761 --> 31:22.930
'cause we're gonna figure out
where our new team stands,

31:22.932 --> 31:25.724
and to be blunt, if
there are any weak links

31:25.726 --> 31:28.312
standing in our way to success.

31:29.563 --> 31:30.855
So we're gonna be active.

31:30.857 --> 31:32.105
All right, we're
gonna get outside,

31:32.107 --> 31:33.482
wear comfy clothes,

31:33.484 --> 31:34.983
wear comfy shoes,

31:34.985 --> 31:37.278
this is gonna be a big
team-building experience.

31:37.280 --> 31:38.572
No cell phones.

31:40.116 --> 31:42.450
I can't stress that enough.

31:42.452 --> 31:43.912
This is about us.

31:44.953 --> 31:46.453
If I see a cell phone,

31:46.455 --> 31:48.373
you will be terminated.

31:50.460 --> 31:53.336
So no partying
tonight, get some rest.

31:53.338 --> 31:56.838
We'll see you bright
and early, okay.

31:56.840 --> 32:00.261
(tense thunderous music)

32:23.827 --> 32:28.039
Team, I hope you're rested
and ready to get started.

32:29.915 --> 32:33.835
I wanna thank you in
advance for your sacrifice.

32:33.837 --> 32:36.673
Both unfortunately
and gratefully,

32:38.508 --> 32:41.094
I've learned that in this world

32:42.177 --> 32:45.098
things like sympathy
and compassion,

32:49.184 --> 32:53.688
they don't buy things like
houses, or cars, or boats.

32:53.690 --> 32:56.568
They don't get you
women or power.

33:00.363 --> 33:01.988
A wise man had to
figure it out, he said,

33:01.990 --> 33:03.199
greed is good,

33:05.577 --> 33:06.786
greed is good.

33:08.370 --> 33:10.078
Because if being
poor made us happy

33:10.080 --> 33:13.249
well, then we'd all be poor.

33:13.251 --> 33:15.462
Gordon Gekko had it right,

33:17.213 --> 33:18.839
Jesus had it wrong.

33:20.508 --> 33:22.383
I apologize about
the misleading nature

33:22.385 --> 33:26.598
of this trip, but well, we
had to get you out here.

33:28.223 --> 33:31.058
The large financial
company that we work for

33:31.060 --> 33:32.769
needs to find out
who has what it takes

33:32.771 --> 33:34.436
to get to the top,

33:34.438 --> 33:38.067
instinct to do what's
best for the company,

33:39.359 --> 33:41.445
no matter the human cost.

33:42.905 --> 33:44.529
We need sharks.

33:44.531 --> 33:47.117
I'm sorry, I'm not following.

33:48.243 --> 33:49.826
In one minute, I'm
gonna ask you to turn

33:49.828 --> 33:51.162
and face that direction,

33:51.164 --> 33:52.747
and then you are going to run.

33:52.749 --> 33:55.333
And I hope you run fast

33:55.335 --> 33:58.586
because we are going
to find you, catch you,

33:58.588 --> 34:00.462
and kill you.

34:00.464 --> 34:03.425
You'll have a 20
minute head start.

34:04.594 --> 34:08.011
I don't understand
the point of this game.

34:08.013 --> 34:10.098
[Chip] It's not.

34:10.100 --> 34:11.223
What?

34:11.225 --> 34:13.266
It's not a game.

34:13.268 --> 34:15.143
Any other questions?

34:15.146 --> 34:18.190
Um, this is kinda
weirding me out.

34:19.484 --> 34:20.565
I'm not sure I'm okay with this,

34:20.568 --> 34:22.525
I'm just gonna sit it out.

34:22.527 --> 34:23.610
This isn't like
getting picked last

34:23.612 --> 34:26.321
in gym class, sweetheart.

34:26.322 --> 34:28.408
There is no sitting out.

34:28.409 --> 34:29.783
You have 15 seconds to realize

34:29.784 --> 34:33.080
that you're about to
be fucking hunted.

34:35.456 --> 34:36.498
(gun fires)

34:36.501 --> 34:38.125
[Sophie] Oh my God!

34:38.127 --> 34:40.127
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

34:40.129 --> 34:41.795
Help him, he's dying!

34:41.797 --> 34:42.795
I shot him straight
through the heart,

34:42.797 --> 34:44.255
he's already dead.

34:44.257 --> 34:45.510
Jesus Christ.

34:46.428 --> 34:48.636
Your time is up.

34:48.638 --> 34:49.553
Run.

34:49.554 --> 34:51.054
(dramatic uneasy music)

34:51.056 --> 34:51.933
Run!

35:00.066 --> 35:01.399
What the fuck, man.

35:01.401 --> 35:02.482
What a waste.

35:02.484 --> 35:03.817
I had my eye on that guy.

35:03.819 --> 35:05.903
Calm down, they
needed a reason to run,

35:05.905 --> 35:07.446
I gave them one.

35:07.448 --> 35:09.406
Besides, he wouldn't have
lasted an hour out there.

35:09.408 --> 35:11.283
There's plenty for everybody.

35:11.285 --> 35:12.660
Plus, this needs to be
an actual challenge,

35:12.662 --> 35:14.995
so shut the fuck up.

35:14.997 --> 35:16.957
We leave in 20 minutes.

35:23.423 --> 35:26.256
Oh my god (sobs), oh my god.

35:26.258 --> 35:27.135
Oh my god.

35:28.260 --> 35:30.218
[Marcus] What the
fuck is happening?

35:30.220 --> 35:32.388
We need to keep running.

35:32.390 --> 35:36.808
I can't (sobs), they're
not gonna hurt me, I can't.

35:36.810 --> 35:40.437
Sophie, they just shot
Johnny in the goddamn chest.

35:40.439 --> 35:42.522
He's dead, they're
going to kill us.

35:42.524 --> 35:44.234
We need to move now.

35:47.571 --> 35:48.821
Fuck.

35:48.823 --> 35:50.781
I don't, I don't
see them coming.

35:50.783 --> 35:52.993
Which way are we gonna go?

35:55.622 --> 35:57.120
I don't know.

35:57.122 --> 35:58.622
Do you remember any
houses on the way?

35:58.624 --> 36:00.542
Um, I don't remember.

36:01.961 --> 36:03.004
Oh my god.

36:04.756 --> 36:06.296
Let's follow the trees.

36:06.298 --> 36:08.174
There has to be a
farmhouse close.

36:08.176 --> 36:09.383
[Marcus] All right.

36:09.385 --> 36:10.343
I think I remember
one on the north side

36:10.345 --> 36:13.720
about a block of our final turn.

36:13.722 --> 36:14.721
All right, all
right, all right.

36:14.723 --> 36:15.723
[Sam] Help me.

36:15.725 --> 36:16.848
All right, all
right, let's go.

36:16.850 --> 36:17.683
[Sam] Come on Sophie.

36:17.685 --> 36:18.767
[Marcus] Let's go.

36:18.769 --> 36:20.977
Come on, let's go.

36:20.979 --> 36:21.812
Hey, you got it.

36:21.814 --> 36:22.647
[Marcus] Come on!

36:22.649 --> 36:24.234
I can't, I can't.

36:25.068 --> 36:27.067
Fine, leave her.

36:27.069 --> 36:27.901
[Sam] Sophie!

36:27.903 --> 36:28.946
I'm going.

36:30.156 --> 36:33.910
Soph, Sophie, Sophie,
you need to move now.

36:36.662 --> 36:39.080
They're not gonna hurt me.

36:39.082 --> 36:40.040
They can't.

36:43.586 --> 36:44.836
They didn't see us (sobs).

36:44.838 --> 36:46.046
[Sam] Sorry.

36:47.256 --> 36:50.133
Leave, they're
not gonna hurt me.

36:50.135 --> 36:51.428
I have to go.

37:17.787 --> 37:19.828
What is she doing?

37:19.830 --> 37:21.788
Why is she just laying there?

37:21.790 --> 37:23.126
I don't know.

37:27.421 --> 37:28.754
You think it's a trap?

37:28.756 --> 37:32.299
(chuckles) They're not
smart enough for that.

37:32.301 --> 37:36.470
I don't understand
why she isn't running.

37:36.472 --> 37:39.098
You know what
it reminds me of?

37:39.100 --> 37:40.683
It's like those
people in World War II

37:40.685 --> 37:45.062
that just waited in line
to get shot or hung.

37:45.064 --> 37:49.524
They didn't run, they didn't
fight for their lives.

37:49.526 --> 37:51.070
They just gave up.

37:52.655 --> 37:54.988
It's fucking weird, man.

37:54.990 --> 37:55.824
Right.

37:56.825 --> 37:57.658
(phone beeps)

37:57.660 --> 37:59.410
Hey Chip, I found one.

37:59.412 --> 38:00.620
The blond girl.

38:00.622 --> 38:02.705
We're at the tree line,
northwest corridor.

38:02.707 --> 38:06.002
(slow thrilling music)

38:26.981 --> 38:28.691
You need to focus.

38:30.068 --> 38:32.361
Remember the four core P's,

38:34.196 --> 38:35.073
power.

38:36.198 --> 38:37.032
Passion.

38:38.325 --> 38:39.535
Perseverance.

38:41.037 --> 38:41.870
Payday.

38:43.122 --> 38:44.665
Good, now do it.

38:50.046 --> 38:50.922
Do it.

38:57.220 --> 39:00.846
We gamble with peoples
lives every day,

39:00.848 --> 39:04.892
their retirement, their
future, for the greater good.

39:04.894 --> 39:08.022
You can't look at
her and see a face,

39:08.897 --> 39:10.191
or see a story.

39:11.651 --> 39:15.194
She's just someone
you don't know.

39:15.196 --> 39:16.239
Just a name!

39:18.533 --> 39:22.746
And if you can't put your life
and your future ahead of her,

39:25.247 --> 39:28.542
well then, this
business isn't for you.

39:30.879 --> 39:31.755
Now do it!

39:37.926 --> 39:40.262
(DJ pants)

39:55.278 --> 39:57.528
We still have time.

39:57.530 --> 39:59.406
Alex this one's yours.

40:07.957 --> 40:09.457
(gun fires)

40:09.459 --> 40:12.712
(shrill frantic music)

40:33.691 --> 40:34.567
Marcus.

40:36.151 --> 40:36.985
Marcus.

40:47.664 --> 40:49.624
(thud)

40:51.667 --> 40:53.669
(thud)

41:04.597 --> 41:06.975
(Sam gasps)

41:09.810 --> 41:13.356
(frenzied dramatic music)

41:25.160 --> 41:28.245
(slow subdued music)

41:51.519 --> 41:54.731
(slow sinister music)

42:56.209 --> 42:58.750
Well, she's in one
of these buildings.

42:58.752 --> 43:00.711
Set up a perimeter.

43:00.713 --> 43:02.298
It'll be dark soon.

43:54.309 --> 43:56.519
Guys, guys, I found her!

43:58.437 --> 44:01.691
(both grunt and groan)

44:03.526 --> 44:06.196
(punches thud)

44:45.859 --> 44:49.238
(slow foreboding music)

44:53.575 --> 44:54.408
(gun fires)

44:54.410 --> 44:55.910
(body thuds)

44:55.912 --> 44:58.289
(Sam pants)

45:16.432 --> 45:18.309
Welcome to the team.

45:20.937 --> 45:24.149
(slow menacing music)

45:28.986 --> 45:33.781
(chuckles) The bosses
will be pleased.

45:33.783 --> 45:36.616
You start on Monday, 300K.

45:36.618 --> 45:37.826
Wyatt'll have your
welcome packet

45:37.828 --> 45:40.622
and all the details
on the ride back.

45:43.959 --> 45:48.130
It's okay, cleanup crew's
coming, you can drop it.

45:50.633 --> 45:51.631
(gun thuds)

45:51.633 --> 45:52.510
Good girl.

45:58.098 --> 45:59.475
Way to go, kiddo.

46:06.649 --> 46:08.982
(computer beeps)

46:08.984 --> 46:11.151
(computer dings)

46:11.153 --> 46:12.153
I guess you just have to wait.

46:12.155 --> 46:13.988
(knocking on door)

46:13.990 --> 46:15.906
(computer dings)

46:15.908 --> 46:18.658
All righty, wish me luck.

46:18.660 --> 46:21.455
(computer dings)

46:28.254 --> 46:30.673
(door thuds)

46:35.428 --> 46:37.053
Is here okay?

46:37.055 --> 46:37.931
Yeah.

46:38.765 --> 46:41.557
Okay, did you wanna a drink?

46:41.559 --> 46:43.267
I want what you want.

46:43.269 --> 46:44.935
It's $200, they told
you that, right?

46:44.937 --> 46:47.147
Um, uh, yeah, I suppose.

46:51.276 --> 46:53.569
Do you wanna get to it or?

46:53.571 --> 46:56.948
(laughs) Sorry,
still new at this.

46:56.950 --> 46:58.950
That's all right.

46:58.952 --> 47:00.200
That's cool, that's cool.

47:00.202 --> 47:03.620
Um, so, do you want a
drink or no drink or...

47:03.622 --> 47:04.955
Yes, yes, drink.

47:04.957 --> 47:06.751
Okay, great, okay.

47:17.595 --> 47:18.428
There you go.

47:18.430 --> 47:19.720
Thanks.

47:19.722 --> 47:20.638
Please, sit down.

47:20.640 --> 47:22.140
[Woman] Thank you.

47:22.142 --> 47:25.727
Excuse me, I'm a, I'm
just gonna get something.

47:25.729 --> 47:26.562
What?

47:29.356 --> 47:30.189
Protection.

47:30.191 --> 47:32.399
Oh (laughs), right.

47:32.401 --> 47:33.235
Good.

47:37.948 --> 47:39.698
(computer dings)

47:39.700 --> 47:40.659
Is that on?

47:45.414 --> 47:46.373
The webcam,

47:47.917 --> 47:48.750
is it on?

47:48.752 --> 47:50.959
(computer dings)

47:50.961 --> 47:53.756
(computer beeps)

47:56.926 --> 47:59.551
No, he's not, he's
not the problem.

47:59.553 --> 48:01.386
There just isn't a lot
of, you know, acting jobs

48:01.388 --> 48:03.307
going on at the moment.

48:05.225 --> 48:06.935
No, I, okay, listen,

48:08.062 --> 48:10.354
I'm not, I'm not gonna
ask my engineer brother

48:10.356 --> 48:12.399
for acting advice, okay?

48:17.196 --> 48:18.571
Uh, listen, it's
getting really late,

48:18.573 --> 48:20.950
so I'm just gonna go to bed.

48:23.243 --> 48:25.120
Yeah, I love you, too.

48:28.624 --> 48:29.458
Hmm.

48:36.298 --> 48:39.468
(slow ominous music)

48:57.528 --> 49:00.406
(Lillian whimpers)

49:02.742 --> 49:05.995
(tense gripping music)

49:16.214 --> 49:20.093
(Lillian coughs and whimpers)

49:31.812 --> 49:35.066
(tense sinister music)

49:52.124 --> 49:53.875
Help, help me!

49:53.877 --> 49:54.878
Help, hello!

49:56.004 --> 49:58.839
Please, help me,
get me out of here!

50:15.106 --> 50:17.984
(Lillian screams)

50:33.917 --> 50:35.543
No, no, wait, come!

50:36.586 --> 50:37.462
Come back.

50:49.598 --> 50:53.227
(Lillian sobs and screams)

51:11.412 --> 51:15.705
(camera whirs and clicks)

51:15.707 --> 51:16.751
Who's there?

51:23.675 --> 51:27.301
(camera whirs and clicks)

51:27.303 --> 51:29.888
What the fuck do you want, huh?

51:35.854 --> 51:39.399
(camera whirs and clicks)

51:42.234 --> 51:43.444
You sick fuck.

52:05.716 --> 52:08.177
(door thuds)

52:24.109 --> 52:24.986
No.

52:26.528 --> 52:27.530
Don't, get,

52:28.740 --> 52:30.116
off me, get off!

52:31.658 --> 52:35.035
What do you want from, get off!

52:35.037 --> 52:37.998
(Lillian whimpers)

52:40.627 --> 52:42.087
Get away from me!

52:46.633 --> 52:48.926
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

52:51.845 --> 52:56.059
No, no, let me go,
let me go (sobs).

52:58.685 --> 53:02.356
No, no, no, no, no (spits),

53:04.316 --> 53:06.902
(Lillian sobs)

53:13.243 --> 53:16.243
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

53:16.245 --> 53:19.081
(Lillian screams)

53:40.437 --> 53:43.106
(stone grates)

54:05.711 --> 54:08.589
(Lillian screams)

54:15.972 --> 54:16.805
Why?

54:22.102 --> 54:24.229
What do you want from me?

54:38.827 --> 54:40.953
I can hear the camera, you know.

54:40.955 --> 54:42.580
(slow haunting music)

54:42.582 --> 54:44.542
I know you can hear me.

54:47.169 --> 54:49.046
I know you can see me.

54:55.260 --> 54:58.261
So what do you
want from me, huh?

54:58.263 --> 55:01.934
What the fuck do you
want, you fucking perv?

55:11.568 --> 55:12.444
Huh?

55:14.406 --> 55:17.200
You can not keep
me here forever!

56:40.617 --> 56:42.202

56:53.588 --> 56:54.464
No!

56:59.635 --> 57:00.468
(banging on door)

57:00.470 --> 57:03.055

58:25.305 --> 58:27.220
Four, what do I do.

59:25.698 --> 59:26.825
It is over!

59:28.450 --> 59:31.243
(audience cheers and applauds)

59:31.245 --> 59:35.163
Lillian Rouge has
endured three months

59:35.165 --> 59:36.917
in The Viewing Room.

59:43.466 --> 59:45.551
How do you feel, Lillian?

59:49.513 --> 59:51.555
You have made it through.

59:51.557 --> 59:54.683
You are only minutes
away from finding out

59:54.685 --> 59:57.062
whether you've won $200,000.

01:00:01.024 --> 01:00:03.403
How does that make you feel?

01:00:08.533 --> 01:00:09.993
Uh, uh, uh, well,

01:00:11.827 --> 01:00:13.493
it looks like Lillian's
a bit caught up

01:00:13.495 --> 01:00:15.205
for words right now.

01:00:17.667 --> 01:00:19.459
Let's take a look back

01:00:19.461 --> 01:00:21.504
at how this all started.

01:00:22.671 --> 01:00:24.087
This week on Snare,

01:00:24.089 --> 01:00:26.758
aspiring actress and
bakehouse employee,

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.426
Lillian Rouge is thrown
in The Viewing Room

01:00:29.428 --> 01:00:31.513
for her shot at $200,000.

01:00:34.725 --> 01:00:36.433
I nominated Lillian for Snare

01:00:36.435 --> 01:00:38.310
because she has a
great personality.

01:00:38.312 --> 01:00:40.979
And now the world will
get to know her as I do.

01:00:40.981 --> 01:00:43.982
Plus, an extra
$200,000 couldn't hurt.

01:00:43.984 --> 01:00:46.861
Lillian won our hearts
from the very beginning

01:00:46.863 --> 01:00:50.531
with #BiteThatFinger
trending worldwide.

01:00:50.533 --> 01:00:52.033
(slow dramatic music)

01:00:52.035 --> 01:00:53.787
She made us laugh and

01:00:57.082 --> 01:00:58.415
she made us cry.

01:01:00.584 --> 01:01:03.419
(audience cheers and applauds)

01:01:03.421 --> 01:01:04.881
Voting is closed.

01:01:06.256 --> 01:01:08.883
I have the results here

01:01:08.885 --> 01:01:10.845
on this piece of paper.

01:01:13.305 --> 01:01:14.598
You have voted.

01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:19.521
Is Lillian worth it?

01:01:26.068 --> 01:01:27.945
Does she win $200,000?

01:01:33.575 --> 01:01:37.539
(audience cheers and applauds)

01:01:39.957 --> 01:01:41.166
The answer is,

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.841
ladies and gentlemen,

01:01:50.843 --> 01:01:54.597
yes, Lillian wins with an
approval rating of 87%!

01:01:55.682 --> 01:01:58.057
Lillian has won all our hearts.

01:01:58.059 --> 01:02:02.395
She has now been given
a check for $200,000!

01:02:02.397 --> 01:02:03.854
Congratulations, Lillian.

01:02:03.856 --> 01:02:06.107
May all your dreams come true.

01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:09.446
