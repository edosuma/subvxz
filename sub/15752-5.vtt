WEBVTT

00:10.211 --> 00:11.412
All right.
Shh.

00:11.412 --> 00:12.613
I don't want
to wake up Maggie.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.048
I can't find my shirt.

00:14.048 --> 00:15.883
Well, it's not a proper
walk of shame

00:15.883 --> 00:18.252
unless you've lost some clothes
and some self-respect.

00:18.252 --> 00:20.188
Are you slut-shaming me
right now?

00:20.188 --> 00:22.556
- Yes. Yes, I am.
- Yeah?

00:25.559 --> 00:28.496
[clattering]
- Oh.

00:28.496 --> 00:31.099
[gasps]
What are you doing?

00:31.099 --> 00:32.433
He's taking out the trash.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.268
That's not the trash.
That's my art.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.469
I'm sorry.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.037
(Liza)
Maggie, you remember Josh?

00:37.037 --> 00:38.506
I do.
Good morning, Josh.

00:38.506 --> 00:39.940
All right, well...

00:39.940 --> 00:41.175
I will call you later.

00:41.175 --> 00:43.144
Okay.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.745
I'm sorry,
again.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.616
You snuck a boy in?

00:48.616 --> 00:50.618
No, I walked him in.
I was sneaking him out.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.586
Am I not allowed to have boys
spend the night?

00:52.586 --> 00:54.422
No, I've never even
thought about it.

00:54.422 --> 00:55.789
I mean, how about

00:55.789 --> 00:57.725
you're not allowed to have
boys spend the night

00:57.725 --> 00:59.927
who trash my art--
sound good?

00:59.927 --> 01:01.495
Fair enough.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.597
These actually
still might work.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.933
I'm transforming
old perfume bottles

01:05.933 --> 01:07.135
into beer bottles.

01:07.135 --> 01:08.802
It's part of
my new show called

01:08.802 --> 01:11.872
Deceptive Intentions:
Reconstructing Gender Norms.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.141
Or Bitches Brew.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.275
I haven't decided yet.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.776
I didn't know you had
a show next month.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.245
Well, I haven't had
time to tell you

01:17.245 --> 01:19.380
because you're so busy
living your fabulous,

01:19.380 --> 01:20.614
new, 26-year-old life.

01:20.614 --> 01:21.815
[laughs]
Fabulous.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.451
I'm tired
all the time.

01:23.451 --> 01:25.219
I'm either out partying
or having sex and--

01:25.219 --> 01:26.420
- Oh.
- Yeah. All right.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.655
Yeah, I realized
as soon as I said that

01:27.655 --> 01:28.822
I wasn't gonna get
much sympathy.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.023
I feel like I saw
more of you

01:30.023 --> 01:31.425
when you lived
in New Jersey.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.726
Why don't we do
something tonight?

01:32.726 --> 01:34.162
Well, there's this new
young artist

01:34.162 --> 01:35.463
premiering at my gallery,

01:35.463 --> 01:36.930
and I need to show up
to be supportive.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.599
It's gonna be awful.
Come with me.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.067
I'm in.
You sold me.

01:40.067 --> 01:42.503
Let's make sure to get
a crappy meal beforehand too.

01:45.906 --> 01:48.809
I need you to be on your game
today, Liza.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.179
And then raise your same
several levels to my game.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.346
Do you think
you can do that?

01:52.346 --> 01:53.847
- Uh...
- Just try to keep up.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.716
Charles has
scheduled a meeting,

01:55.716 --> 01:57.685
and I've heard it is
about repackaging.

01:57.685 --> 02:00.188
And do you know who is
in charge of repackaging?

02:00.188 --> 02:01.589
- Us.
- Me.

02:01.589 --> 02:04.525
And perhaps,
if the client is big enough,

02:04.525 --> 02:05.893
Charles too.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.995
We may even have to work
some late nights.

02:07.995 --> 02:08.996
Do you like him?

02:08.996 --> 02:10.663
He is a married man,
Liza.

02:10.663 --> 02:13.267
But an attractive straight man
in a publishing house is rare.

02:13.267 --> 02:16.304
It's like finding
Louboutins at a yard sale.

02:16.304 --> 02:18.972
Plus I heard a rumor
his marriage is on the rocks.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.708
So we are going
into that conference room

02:20.708 --> 02:21.975
for that meeting.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.578
I need you to take
detailed notes.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.214
I plan on being
distracted.

02:27.381 --> 02:30.218
So Hollywood is finally
starting to recognize

02:30.218 --> 02:31.519
Chinua Achebe's work,

02:31.519 --> 02:33.221
and we are in discussions
with the estate

02:33.221 --> 02:36.357
for the rights to reissue
and repackage the book

02:36.357 --> 02:38.792
to accompany
the film release.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.329
[groans]
I'm dying.

02:41.329 --> 02:42.530
What's wrong?

02:42.530 --> 02:43.964
My Goddess Cup is stuck.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.233
It feels like it's launching

02:45.233 --> 02:47.501
unsanctioned air strikes
on my cervix.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.437
What's a Goddess Cup?

02:49.437 --> 02:52.440
Like, a menstrual
accoutrement.

02:52.440 --> 02:55.008
You know, it's like a tampon,
but eco-friendly.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.610
It sits up inside
your stuff like a--

02:56.610 --> 02:57.911
Like a diaphragm?

02:57.911 --> 03:00.013
What's a diaphragm?

03:00.013 --> 03:01.949
I can't.
I have got to go.

03:01.949 --> 03:02.983
[groans]

03:02.983 --> 03:04.752
(Charles)
The nun plays the role.

03:06.119 --> 03:09.523
Wow, this message board
is filled with angry emojis.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.958
Apparently this happens
a lot.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.327
Okay--okay, okay, okay.
Here we go.

03:13.327 --> 03:16.397
If you orgasm, the contractions
will release the cup.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.499
Orgasm?
I'm at work.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.401
I can talk you
through it.

03:20.401 --> 03:21.635
Kelsey?

03:21.635 --> 03:23.170
I'm back here.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.508
- Are you okay?
- No.

03:27.508 --> 03:28.776
It's still up there.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.811
Clearly I have a huge vagina.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.480
I'm not sure why I bother
carrying a purse.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.815
(girl on phone)
Hey, I knew a girl who got
a tampon stuck

03:34.815 --> 03:36.384
and she had to go
to the walk-in clinic.

03:36.384 --> 03:39.553
Weeks later, she was convinced
a rat had died in her apartment,

03:39.553 --> 03:41.021
but it was just her.

03:41.021 --> 03:44.392
It turns out, the clinic only
removed half the tampon.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.294
That's a cute story.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.495
Liza,

03:47.495 --> 03:48.729
I'm gonna need
your help.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.698
Okay, what can I do?

03:50.698 --> 03:52.099
I need you
to lock the door,

03:52.099 --> 03:54.635
and I need you
to wash your hands.

03:54.635 --> 03:57.037
I wouldn't ask,
but it's an emergency, okay?

03:57.037 --> 03:59.172
I'm going on,
like, 14 hours here.

04:01.141 --> 04:02.810
Damn it.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.879
(woman)
* Check it in, check it out,
show them what you got *

04:05.879 --> 04:08.482
* What the
are you all about? *

04:08.482 --> 04:09.683
* What the

04:09.683 --> 04:10.918
Thank you.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.520
We will never speak
of this again.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.055
Liza.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.958
You are the real deal.

04:17.958 --> 04:21.228
Anything you ever need,
ever,

04:21.228 --> 04:23.130
I got you.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.602
I'm so sorry.
I was in the bathroom.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.170
Spare me the details.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.340
Charles wants to get together
and talk about this repackaging,

04:32.340 --> 04:34.007
so I volunteered to meet him
over lunch.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.609
Oh, are you
going out?

04:35.609 --> 04:38.245
No, we're eating in here.
It's a work lunch, Liza.

04:38.245 --> 04:40.448
Quick question.

04:40.448 --> 04:44.217
When I put my chin in my hand,
do I look riveted?

04:44.217 --> 04:47.655
Or like I'm holding
a pastry bag of chin skin?

04:47.655 --> 04:48.956
I'm so sorry.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.991
I was distracted
by this prestigious award

04:50.991 --> 04:52.793
from the London lit fair
on your desk.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.628
2012.
Bad year for books.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.829
Good year for trout.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.197
Now, lunch.

04:57.197 --> 04:59.367
I want you to get the specials
from Betony on 57th.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.168
And I want them hot,
so take the car service.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.570
Empirical has
a car service?

05:02.570 --> 05:04.171
Only for work
emergencies.

05:04.171 --> 05:06.407
It's an emergency.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.776
(woman)
* Doing that thing I love

05:08.776 --> 05:10.378
* Can't get enough *

05:10.378 --> 05:12.279
* That thing you got

05:12.279 --> 05:14.047
* You know I want it, baby

05:14.047 --> 05:15.883
* Doing that thing I love

05:15.883 --> 05:17.485
* Can't get enough *

05:17.485 --> 05:21.589
* What you need is a woman
who can understand *

05:21.589 --> 05:24.992
* I heard you knock
at my door *

05:24.992 --> 05:27.661
* Watch me open up

05:27.661 --> 05:29.563
* Oh

05:31.732 --> 05:33.133
But I am--

05:33.133 --> 05:36.003
I am really excited
about this repackage.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.705
Have you read Achebe?

05:37.705 --> 05:39.239
I'm sure I have.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.909
Yeah, Things Fall Apart
is one of my favorite books.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.578
I actually think it's required
reading, now, in high school.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.079
It is.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.415
Oh, yeah.
Have you read it?

05:47.415 --> 05:48.882
Yeah, I read
the entire trilogy.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.083
I couldn't put it down.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.319
Yes, the trilogy
is groundbreaking.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.254
Oh, so you have
read Achebe.

05:54.254 --> 05:56.790
What's your favorite?

05:56.790 --> 05:58.091
Of the trilogy?

05:58.091 --> 06:00.193
Oh, well, um...

06:01.228 --> 06:04.231
Probably the second book.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.734
No Longer at Ease...

06:06.734 --> 06:08.068
Then put the box down.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.603
Is a great title
for the second book,

06:09.603 --> 06:11.071
don't you think?

06:11.071 --> 06:13.574
(Liza)
About a man caught
between two worlds.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.276
Adiche's Americanah comes close
to capturing that experience,

06:16.276 --> 06:18.879
but nothing measures up
to Achebe.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.148
You're very well-read.
I'm impressed.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.750
You know what
I'm not impressed with

06:22.750 --> 06:23.951
is the state
of this cod.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.454
It's freezing.

06:26.454 --> 06:30.157
Take that
on your way out.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.359
Thank you.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.229
(Diana)
I'm ecstatic.

06:37.831 --> 06:41.301
Yes, absolutely.
Okay.

06:41.301 --> 06:44.071
[chuckles softly]

06:44.071 --> 06:45.906
Don't you ever book-drop
like that again.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.307
I was only trying
to help.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.376
You were insinuating
that I am bad at my job.

06:49.376 --> 06:51.344
I will have you know that
I am the hardest worker here.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.246
When these lightweights
go on vacation, I work;

06:53.246 --> 06:55.348
while you were Instagramming
your way through India,

06:55.348 --> 06:56.784
I was working;
and before that,

06:56.784 --> 06:58.786
when you were vaporizing
on the quad at Dartmouth,

06:58.786 --> 07:00.320
developing your fondness
for African literature,

07:00.320 --> 07:01.955
do you know where I was?

07:01.955 --> 07:04.725
- I'm gonna say at work?
- And don't you forget it.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.897
Whoo.

07:09.897 --> 07:12.165
Let's go get a drink tonight.
I owe you one.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.501
I might need a week
before I can even

07:13.501 --> 07:14.668
look at you again.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.236
Besides, I can't tonight.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.071
I'm going to an art show
with my roommate.

07:18.071 --> 07:21.074
Ew, that old lady
you met on Craigslist?

07:21.074 --> 07:23.076
- I'll rescue you.
- No, no, no. It's okay.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.344
We probably won't
stay long.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.746
It's supposed to be
really bad.

07:25.746 --> 07:26.947
Not if I come.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.348
I'll bring my friends.
It'll be fun.

07:28.348 --> 07:29.950
No, it's okay.
I--

07:29.950 --> 07:31.685
This is happening.

07:39.727 --> 07:41.529
So Kelsey's coming
to this show?

07:41.529 --> 07:43.797
Yeah, she sort of
invited herself.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.132
It'll be fine.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.734
Or weird.

07:46.734 --> 07:49.402
You know, you and me
hanging out is just--

07:49.402 --> 07:51.204
I'm just worried
she's gonna think I'm--

07:51.204 --> 07:53.406
- Gay?
- Old...er.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.543
Don't worry--I promise
not to blow your cover.

07:55.543 --> 07:56.944
I'll just be your roommate.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.145
Your older roommate.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.547
Who I found
on Craigslist.

07:59.547 --> 08:00.681
Craigslist?

08:00.681 --> 08:02.049
Why are you hanging out
with me?

08:02.049 --> 08:03.551
'Cause you're cool.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.553
You're my cool older roommate
I found on Craigslist.

08:05.553 --> 08:06.887
I am cool.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.255
I lived in Williamsburg
before it's all

08:08.255 --> 08:09.790
rich kids on unicycles.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.325
I was your coolest friend,
remember?

08:12.325 --> 08:14.695
You were the one--
the housewife from New Jersey

08:14.695 --> 08:16.997
who went to book club
and drank Tequila Mockingbirds.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.465
That is a delicious cocktail.

08:18.465 --> 08:20.267
And that book club helped me
impress my publisher today,

08:20.267 --> 08:21.869
so I'm grateful to them.

08:21.869 --> 08:24.171
Yeah, we should've thrown back
a couple of cocktails,

08:24.171 --> 08:25.673
'cause this is
gonna be rough.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.575
I mean, we might be
the only people there.

08:27.575 --> 08:30.644
[people chattering]

08:32.412 --> 08:33.813
Wow.

08:35.414 --> 08:37.585
- Ready?
- Mm.

08:37.585 --> 08:40.754
[Friends theme song playing]

08:40.754 --> 08:48.696
*

08:54.501 --> 08:56.436
I can't tell.
Is this good?

08:56.436 --> 08:57.437
No.

08:57.437 --> 08:58.672
You know, this is
so depressing.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.107
My first show--
the only people that came

09:00.107 --> 09:01.675
were my mom
and my psycho ex-girlfriend

09:01.675 --> 09:03.844
and Phil, the gallery owner,
who's standing over there.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.979
Look at him. Look at him.
He's smiling. He never smiles.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.848
(Liza)
He shouldn't.
His gums are too big.

09:07.848 --> 09:10.017
Almost 20 years
married to a dentist.

09:10.017 --> 09:11.719
- You notice.
- No.

09:11.719 --> 09:14.021
(Liza)
Oh, look--oh, there's Kelsey
and her friends.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.056
Oh, wow, it's like observing
flamingos in nature--

09:16.056 --> 09:18.325
bright, colorful,
and their heads all bent

09:18.325 --> 09:19.993
at an uncomfortable angle.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.461
Hey.

09:21.461 --> 09:22.663
(Kelsey)
Hey.

09:22.663 --> 09:23.864
(Liza)
Okay, here we go.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.633
Remember--no references
before 1990.

09:25.633 --> 09:26.967
There goes
all my material.

09:26.967 --> 09:30.403
Hey!
Hi.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.239
You remember Lauren.
This is Jess.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.506
This exhibit's
amazing.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.175
Yeah, I'm definitely
amazed.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.544
Oh, this is
my roommate, Maggie.

09:37.544 --> 09:38.912
She's also repped
by the gallery.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.748
You're an artist too?
That's cool.

09:40.748 --> 09:43.917
Apparently not as cool
as that guy

09:43.917 --> 09:45.786
talking to Carol Vogel
from the Times,

09:45.786 --> 09:48.288
and bro-nodding to Don
and Mera Rubell,

09:48.288 --> 09:50.423
the biggest art collectors
in the country.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.725
Screw me sideways.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.460
Oh, my God.
That's the artist?

09:53.460 --> 09:55.696
- I love a guy in a high bun.
- Me too. Dibs.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.765
- That guy?
- Yeah, he's way more my type.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.332
Really?
You're already in two

09:59.332 --> 10:01.068
undefined relationships
right now, so--

10:01.068 --> 10:02.770
Define
"undefined."

10:02.770 --> 10:04.972
Christ, I mean, it's like trying
to talk to a loose balloon.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.940
No, they can be focused--
when they're tweeting.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.742
Yeah, I'm sure.
You hang with the flamingos.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.744
I'm gonna go try to
schmooze Phil for two seconds.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.612
- All right?
- Okay. Okay.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.551
I am ret to go.

10:18.551 --> 10:19.887
Yeah, I'm done.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.621
Can we blow off
Craigslist Maggie

10:21.621 --> 10:24.057
and go get a drink already?

10:24.057 --> 10:26.393
One sec.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.328
Hey, how goes
the requisite schmoozing?

10:28.328 --> 10:29.596
Phil can't seem
to break away

10:29.596 --> 10:31.264
from his hipster harem
and talk to me.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.499
I mean, my show's in a month

10:32.499 --> 10:34.201
and not even a mention
of my work.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.669
He's gonna hear about this.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.671
Are you sure you want
to go Mad Maggie on Phil?

10:37.671 --> 10:39.039
He's still sort of
your boss.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.541
Out of my control.
I need to release the beast.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.310
Okay, well, the girls
want to go get a drink,

10:43.310 --> 10:44.845
so do you want
to meet us, or--

10:44.845 --> 10:46.413
I can't be with the girls
right now, all right?

10:46.413 --> 10:47.715
I got to talk to Phil.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.516
If you want me to wait,
I'll wait.

10:49.516 --> 10:50.818
Just go.
It's okay.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.920
Liza,
let's go.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.454
- Okay. Call me?
- All right.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.056
I'll tell you
where we are, okay?

11:03.831 --> 11:07.200
Is Craigslist Maggie, like,
your mentor or something?

11:07.200 --> 11:08.736
Why would she be
her mentor?

11:08.736 --> 11:10.738
Yeah, I don't know why else
she would hang out with her.

11:10.738 --> 11:14.141
It's just nice to have an older,
wiser person around sometimes.

11:14.141 --> 11:17.410
Oh, yes, yes.
That is how I feel about Siri.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.480
Siri, hey,
what is sadness?

11:21.949 --> 11:23.150
Oh, my God.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.218
The Friends guy
just texted me.

11:25.218 --> 11:28.121
- Wait, the artist?
- No, Chandler Bing.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.957
- Yes, the artist.
- I called dibs on him, Jess.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.424
You can't give your number
to a guy

11:31.424 --> 11:33.026
your friend
called dibs on.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.062
- That is girl code.
- She's right. That's girl code.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.629
Yeah, and from
my understanding,

11:36.629 --> 11:38.766
dibs is a binding
verbal contract.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.600
Fine, we will have
a three-way.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.102
That's your answer
for everything.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.337
Well, you claim
to be 60% gay.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.339
Not for you.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.508
Hey, you know what?
No more texting.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.010
Cell stack.

11:52.512 --> 11:53.947
I would like
to make a toast

11:53.947 --> 11:55.282
to Liza Miller,

11:55.282 --> 11:56.950
the Goddess Cup Extractor.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.018
[snickering]

11:58.018 --> 12:00.220
Not afraid to just
reach up in there,

12:00.220 --> 12:02.289
bare-handed,
like a mechanic.

12:02.289 --> 12:05.158
Glad I put a gag order
on that incident.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.895
Sorry--it's kind of
a big deal, though.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.530
Welcome to
the inner circle, Liza.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.165
Friends for life.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.569
For at least
the next 13 years.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.938
She's taking herself out
at 39.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.506
Mm-hmm, the beginning
of the end,

12:19.506 --> 12:21.074
when gravity starts winning.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.475
And you have to buy
a one-piece

12:22.475 --> 12:23.944
because your abs
start disappearing

12:23.944 --> 12:25.378
under your giant foopa.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.180
[laughter]

12:27.180 --> 12:29.282
And your metabolism
just shits the bed.

12:29.282 --> 12:32.052
[laughter]

12:32.052 --> 12:34.254
To strong women.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.823
Ride or die.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.624
Big booty hoes.

12:37.624 --> 12:40.227
Salud.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.461
Bitches!

12:41.461 --> 12:44.597
[all cheering and laughing]

12:46.433 --> 12:47.868

12:47.868 --> 12:49.736
[cheers and laughter]

12:49.736 --> 12:52.205
[phone vibrating]

12:52.205 --> 12:54.341
- I'm gonna do two.
- Yeah!

12:59.179 --> 13:01.281
[groans]

13:08.288 --> 13:12.092
[gulping]

13:12.092 --> 13:14.427
What's going on?
I called you so many times.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.596
I'm so sorry.
I couldn't pick up my phone.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.298
But I'm fine.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.699
Whoa, did you barf?

13:19.699 --> 13:21.068
[laughs]
No.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.269
I went to a shawarma cart.

13:22.269 --> 13:25.272
I was really drunk.
I still kind of am.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.974
But guess what.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.209
I'm part of a crew now.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.544
I have bitches, Maggie,
and we rule.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.246
How exciting for you.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.282
I got into a huge fight
with Phil.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.483
Phil.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.717
With his big,
puffy smile.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.252
A gum recontouring
is what he needs.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.387
[phone beeps]

13:40.387 --> 13:41.889
I kept on pushing him
to explain

13:41.889 --> 13:44.357
why there is absolutely
no mention of my show.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.659
[laughs]

13:46.659 --> 13:47.995
Kelsey and I,

13:47.995 --> 13:50.330
we made a middle-aged
murder pact.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.465
We're gonna kill each other
before we turn 40.

13:52.465 --> 13:53.901
She just texted me--
[laughs]

13:53.901 --> 13:55.602
"Poison my Ensure."

13:55.602 --> 13:56.904
[chuckles]

13:56.904 --> 13:58.906
Who are you
right now?

13:58.906 --> 14:00.373
What? No.

14:00.373 --> 14:04.044
Are you Mad Maggie that I stayed
out late with my crew?

14:04.044 --> 14:06.479
Well, Phil
cancelled my show

14:06.479 --> 14:10.317
and dropped me
from the gallery.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.519
Have a great
rest of your night, yo.

14:17.424 --> 14:18.926
[door slams]

14:23.463 --> 14:24.932
(Courtney Barnett)
* I got drunk and fell asleep

14:24.932 --> 14:26.333
* Atop the sheets

14:26.333 --> 14:28.201
* But luckily
I left the heater on *

14:28.201 --> 14:30.470
*

14:30.470 --> 14:31.972
* And in my dreams I wrote

14:31.972 --> 14:34.007
* The best song
that I've ever written *

14:34.007 --> 14:36.409
* I can't remember
how it goes *

14:36.409 --> 14:38.678
*

14:38.678 --> 14:40.480
* I stayed drunk
and fell awake *

14:40.480 --> 14:42.749
Hi.
I made some coffee.

14:42.749 --> 14:44.351
And I know you don't
eat breakfast,

14:44.351 --> 14:47.087
but if you're feeling hungrier
than you are angry,

14:47.087 --> 14:49.056
I have some toast here--
I could butter it up,

14:49.056 --> 14:50.757
sprinkle on a little
cinnamon and sugar.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.325
It's like eating a hug.

14:52.325 --> 14:55.462
I'm not hungry.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:05.072 --> 15:06.873
This came out good.

15:06.873 --> 15:08.341
Wow, it's really
beautiful, Maggie.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.810
I won't be needing it anymore.
I got dropped.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.212
[smashing]

15:12.212 --> 15:14.181
I'm never gonna find
another gallery at this age.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.249
I completely understand
what you're going through.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.051
No, you don't--
you're completely obsessed

15:18.051 --> 15:19.519
with living this
26-year-old life.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.854
Maggie, me passing as younger
was your idea.

15:21.854 --> 15:24.124
Yeah, to find a job,
not a crew,

15:24.124 --> 15:26.759
or some Tiger Beat cover
of a boyfriend.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.128
He's actually
very mature.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.997
- I needed that show, Liza.
- I know.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.498
Do you? Yeah, I don't know
what you know

15:31.498 --> 15:33.433
and what you've
completely forgotten.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.880
[groans]

15:47.880 --> 15:49.482
Ooh.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.683
You look bad.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.019
Why don't you?

15:52.019 --> 15:54.421
I had a space cake
and a melatonin before bed--

15:54.421 --> 15:55.922
best hangover cure.

15:55.922 --> 15:57.290
Last night was
so much fun.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.392
Oh, my God, do that
Cher impression again.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.460
It was hilarious.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.029
You were at
the shawarma cart like,

16:02.029 --> 16:04.664
* Chicken, lamb,
or beef? *

16:04.664 --> 16:06.733
[groans]
I'm such a jerk.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.269
Wait, what's wrong?

16:09.269 --> 16:11.071
Maggie got dropped
by the gallery.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.339
And I wasn't there
for her.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.874
I was out annoying
a hot meat vendor.

16:14.874 --> 16:17.377
Liza, she's just
your roommate.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.546
I mean, it's awful that she
got dropped from the gallery,

16:19.546 --> 16:21.814
but don't be so hard
on yourself.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.350
Liza.

16:25.518 --> 16:26.686
Shut the door.

16:29.622 --> 16:30.957
Is everything okay?

16:30.957 --> 16:32.492
I'd say so.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.860
The rumors are true.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.128
Charles is getting
divorced.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.496
How do you know that?

16:36.496 --> 16:38.465
His doorman is friends
with my dog walker.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.933
That's why it's important
to stay down with the people.

16:40.933 --> 16:42.469
Wow, divorce.
That's rough.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.304
So is dating in your 40s
and inheriting

16:44.304 --> 16:45.638
your grandmother's
Welsh calves.

16:45.638 --> 16:49.076
Yeah, but a divorce
and going through it alone.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.777
- I can't imagine.
- Exactly.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.812
He's gonna need someone
to be there for him.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.214
Yeah, he definitely will.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.782
Someone to deal with
how crazy he acts

16:55.782 --> 16:57.084
and how selfish
he becomes.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.685
Someone to be the adult
when he's being

16:58.685 --> 17:00.087
totally irresponsible.

17:00.087 --> 17:02.989
I'm hoping we can be
irresponsible together.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.257
What he probably needs

17:04.257 --> 17:06.093
is someone supportive
and grounded.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.694
Or open
and rebounding.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.229
It's a tricky time.

17:11.397 --> 17:14.701
Schedule me a wax appointment
with Dorota.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.104
Uptown and downtown.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.807
Do you know what I mean
when I say "downtown"?

17:20.807 --> 17:22.242
You do.
Okay. Okay.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.512
(Liza)
Maggie's my friend.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.481
I mean, technically,
she's my roommate, yes.

17:28.481 --> 17:29.982
But she's also
my friend.

17:29.982 --> 17:32.952
She's been there for me
when no one else has.

17:32.952 --> 17:34.221
Well, if she's your girl,

17:34.221 --> 17:35.755
then you got to figure out
a way to help her.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.624
I'd love to find someone
to beat up Phil,

17:37.624 --> 17:39.192
the gallery owner.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.827
I think I could do it,
but I don't want to get caught.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.130
We'll come up with something
a little less gangster.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.397
Oh, you don't have
to get involved.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.698
Of course I do--
if you're close

17:45.698 --> 17:47.934
with Craigslist Maggie,
then so am I.

17:47.934 --> 17:50.270
It's girl code.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.771
Well, she has
all this great work

17:51.771 --> 17:53.406
and nowhere to show it.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.475
Maybe I could find her
a new gallery.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.377
I might actually
have something.

17:57.377 --> 17:58.911
Could you get her downtown
after work?

17:58.911 --> 18:01.148
Downtown? I can't even
get her to answer her phone.

18:01.148 --> 18:03.049
I don't know how I'm gonna
get her downtown.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.451
[phone beeps]

18:04.451 --> 18:05.585
Sorry.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.160
I have an idea.

18:18.631 --> 18:21.568
[horn honking]

18:23.336 --> 18:25.205
[honking continues]

18:25.205 --> 18:28.408
[opera music playing]

18:28.408 --> 18:32.011
*

18:32.011 --> 18:33.346
What the hell
are you doing?

18:33.346 --> 18:35.215
Trying to win you back.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.550
Maggie, without you,
I'd be back in Jersey,

18:37.550 --> 18:39.186
drinking Bridget Jones's
Daiquiris

18:39.186 --> 18:40.820
with my book club.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.589
I owe you my life,

18:42.589 --> 18:44.957
my annoying,
26-year-old life.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.559
*

18:46.559 --> 18:48.528
I'm so sorry I wasn't there
for you last night.

18:48.528 --> 18:51.063
I've been completely caught up
in these new relationships--

18:51.063 --> 18:52.299
I know it.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.201
It's hard to make
new friends.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.336
It's harder to lose
old ones.

18:56.336 --> 18:59.706
Well, technically,
you're old too.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.274
*

19:01.274 --> 19:02.675
And you're not losing me.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.811
*

19:04.811 --> 19:06.879
I can't believe you
Pretty Woman-ed me.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.315
I can't believe
I'm Richard Gere

19:08.315 --> 19:09.749
and you're Julia Roberts.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.784
I always thought it'd be
the other way around.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.220
[laughs]

19:13.220 --> 19:14.521
Come down here.
I have a surprise.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.723
All right. All right.
Give me a minute.

19:16.723 --> 19:19.392
*

19:33.072 --> 19:34.274
What is this place?

19:34.274 --> 19:36.108
You'll see.

19:36.108 --> 19:38.645
Hey, guys.
Come on in.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.680
Is Phil tied to a chair
with a gag in his mouth?

19:40.680 --> 19:42.081
No, that's already
been vetoed.

19:42.081 --> 19:43.483
Oh.

19:45.352 --> 19:48.255
[techno music playing]

19:48.255 --> 19:52.259
Lights, lights,
smoke machine.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.426
Drag queen.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.262
Some cheap wine,
little plastic cups,

19:55.262 --> 19:57.264
and voila.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.798
Welcome to your
pop-up gallery.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.533
See, you don't need
Phil's gallery.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.502
You just need a space
where you can show your work.

20:02.502 --> 20:05.004
And our combined
7,000 Facebook friends.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.639
How did you find
this place?

20:06.639 --> 20:08.508
Oh, I went to school
with this dude, Teddy Wong.

20:08.508 --> 20:09.909
His parents
own the building.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.111
Anyway, I bring him weed
and he lets me use the space

20:12.111 --> 20:13.446
for parties
or when I'm buying stuff

20:13.446 --> 20:15.214
from weird people
off Craigslist.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.284
- No offense.
- None taken.

20:17.284 --> 20:18.918
Maggie, I looked up
your work on Artnet,

20:18.918 --> 20:21.621
and it deserves to be
someplace really special.

20:21.621 --> 20:24.791
I love it. I can't believe
you guys did this for me.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.759
Any friend of Liza's.
Come on.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.395
Not just any friend.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.062
My oldest friend.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.298
Yes, your oldest friend.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.165
[laughs]

20:33.165 --> 20:34.801
- Yay!
- Thanks, you guys.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.736
(Liza)
Yay!
