WEBVTT

00:09.661 --> 00:11.054
When Robin Masters

00:11.098 --> 00:12.577
offered me the job
as live-in security consultant

00:12.621 --> 00:14.144
as a way to supplement
my P.I. business,

00:14.188 --> 00:15.450
I jumped at it.

00:16.668 --> 00:17.800
Higgins!

00:17.843 --> 00:19.149
This is Juliet Higgins.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.933
She lives in the main house,
works here

00:20.977 --> 00:22.500
as Robin's majordomo.

00:22.544 --> 00:24.328
We work really
well together.

00:28.158 --> 00:29.333
Magnum, are you about to ask me

00:29.377 --> 00:30.595
to become your partner?

00:30.639 --> 00:34.512
Higgins and Magnum
Private Investigations.

00:34.556 --> 00:35.687
Still up for consideration.

00:35.731 --> 00:36.732
I just need a little more time.

00:36.775 --> 00:37.689
Katsumoto.

00:37.733 --> 00:38.690
When Dotson hired you,

00:38.734 --> 00:39.778
did he mention a girl?

00:39.822 --> 00:41.041
Any woman in his life?

00:41.084 --> 00:42.651
Okay.

00:42.694 --> 00:44.522
You know you just lied to a cop.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.046
You know, just when I was
starting to trust you,

00:46.089 --> 00:47.873
you go and do something stupid
like this.

00:47.917 --> 00:49.832
Do yourself a favor,
Magnum. Try to cooperate.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.660
Earn your trust back.No, you won't.

00:51.703 --> 00:53.705
Who the hell are you?I'm a private investigator.

00:53.749 --> 00:56.360
So you're a private dick.
Stay away from me, got it?

00:56.404 --> 00:57.709
You like her.

00:57.753 --> 00:58.667
I do not like her.

00:58.710 --> 00:59.885
If you like her,

00:59.929 --> 01:01.061
you'll bring her flowers
and apologize.

01:01.104 --> 01:03.106
I don't like her.Liar.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.673
I'm sorry.

01:04.715 --> 01:06.544
I was just doing my job.

01:06.588 --> 01:08.068
But would you go out
with me again?

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:31.352 --> 01:32.657
I've got the Phoenix.

01:32.701 --> 01:34.137
Where?

01:34.181 --> 01:36.052
You're not gonna believe it.

01:54.157 --> 01:56.203
Damn.
She's good.

01:56.246 --> 01:58.422
Stay on her, White Knight.
You got this.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.294
He better.
That thumb drive she stole

02:00.337 --> 02:01.773
is full of classified intel.

02:01.817 --> 02:02.992
That gets out,
you know what that means.

02:03.035 --> 02:04.602
Yeah, spies everywhere

02:04.646 --> 02:06.126
will be found and executed.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.692
Yeah, and probably
tortured in between.

02:07.736 --> 02:10.173
Right.
So no pressure.

02:10.217 --> 02:11.783
Pressure's your
middle name, baby.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.529
Hold up.
"Pressure's your middle name"?

02:18.573 --> 02:20.923
Seriously?
Who says that?

02:20.966 --> 02:23.273
You can put it down
whenever you want.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.275
Oh, don't get me wrong.
I like it.

02:25.319 --> 02:28.235
It's a little cheesy,
but it's a good read.

02:28.278 --> 02:30.367
I don't know.
I'm barely on chapter five,

02:30.411 --> 02:33.196
and I have to say, I think it's
one of Robin's best ones yet.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.851
Huh.

02:35.894 --> 02:38.158
And all of these books
are based on real missions?

02:39.855 --> 02:42.423
According to
Robin, yes.

02:42.466 --> 02:44.164
This White Knight character--
he's what,

02:44.207 --> 02:47.210
like, a composite based
on a whole bunch of real people?

02:47.254 --> 02:48.820
Maybe.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.605
I don't know.
Nobody really knows.

02:50.648 --> 02:51.823
You have to admit,
he's kind of like

02:51.867 --> 02:53.434
a romance novel clichÃ©.
Look.

02:53.477 --> 02:55.523
Actually, he's based on me,

02:55.566 --> 02:57.264
but until I know Abby
a little better,

02:57.307 --> 03:00.180
I should probably
keep that to myself. "Compassionate,

03:00.223 --> 03:02.312
monogamous."
Really?

03:02.356 --> 03:05.924
What if I told you...
he was a real person?

03:05.968 --> 03:07.709
Well, I'd marry him tomorrow.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.798
Really?Yeah.

03:12.061 --> 03:13.454
Hold that thought.Okay.

03:13.497 --> 03:14.672
Be right back.

03:14.716 --> 03:15.891
Okay.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.223
Easy.
Easy, boy.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.225
It's o-it's okay.

03:45.268 --> 03:46.748
Easy.
Easy, boy.

03:48.402 --> 03:50.926
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.407
Easy boy. Come on.
Calm down. Hey, Higgins?!

03:53.450 --> 03:55.278
Higgins?

03:55.322 --> 03:56.540
It's okay.

03:56.584 --> 03:57.672
Higgins!

03:57.715 --> 03:58.716
Shh.

03:58.760 --> 03:59.978
Easy, boy.

04:01.153 --> 04:03.112
Good boys.
Stand down.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.029
Evening, Magnum.

04:07.072 --> 04:09.553
I can't believe you had these
hyenas guarding the wine cellar.

04:09.597 --> 04:12.252
How did you even know
I was gonna be down here?

04:12.295 --> 04:13.557
Oh, it was quite
simple, really.

04:13.601 --> 04:15.864
I spotted you creeping
across the grounds

04:15.907 --> 04:18.649
with a bottle of 2006
Chateau Latour Bordeaux,

04:18.692 --> 04:20.260
and I estimated how
long it would take

04:20.303 --> 04:22.349
two lusting individuals
to finish a bottle

04:22.392 --> 04:23.959
without proper decanting,

04:24.002 --> 04:27.658
and thus deduced when you would
be back to steal another.

04:28.703 --> 04:29.834
You need a hobby.

04:29.878 --> 04:32.620
I have one.
It's catching thieves.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.665
No. Actually, I think

04:34.709 --> 04:36.580
it's busting my stones for
your own personal amusement.

04:36.624 --> 04:39.017
You know, I thought this
kind of thing was gonna end

04:39.061 --> 04:40.497
now that we're gonna
be business partners.

04:40.541 --> 04:43.152
Need I remind you
I have yet to accept your offer.

04:43.195 --> 04:44.588
Oh, right.

04:44.632 --> 04:45.937
You're still thinking about it.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.287
That's right.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.679
You know what I don't get

04:48.723 --> 04:50.420
is last week,
you said you wanted

04:50.464 --> 04:52.335
to sit down
to go over my offer,

04:52.379 --> 04:53.467
check out the books, make sure

04:53.510 --> 04:55.164
you were making
an informed decision.

04:55.207 --> 04:57.862
Mm-hmm.Yet, every time I try to talk
about it, you put it off.

04:57.906 --> 05:00.343
Do you enjoy just making me
wait for an answer?

05:00.387 --> 05:01.736
Being majordomo of this estate

05:01.779 --> 05:03.346
is a huge responsibility,
Magnum.

05:03.390 --> 05:05.174
I'm a very busy woman.

05:05.217 --> 05:08.395
Yet you still find time
to stake out a wine cellar.

05:08.438 --> 05:11.267
You know what? I'm actually
glad you keep putting it off,

05:11.311 --> 05:12.921
because, I've been thinking.

05:12.964 --> 05:16.316
Maybe this whole partner thing
is... is just not a great idea.

05:16.359 --> 05:18.056
You know, it's not like
I need you.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.320
Really, Magnum?
Reverse psychology?

05:20.363 --> 05:21.756
You think that ploy will work?

05:21.799 --> 05:23.061
What am I, six?

05:23.105 --> 05:24.454
It's not a ploy.
I just realized

05:24.498 --> 05:26.151
that I am better off
without you.

05:26.195 --> 05:28.719
Plus, I'd have
to make new business cards.

05:28.763 --> 05:30.330
You need me and you know it.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.419
I can get my own laptop.

05:32.462 --> 05:34.334
You know how many times
I've heard that?

05:36.074 --> 05:37.467
Hey, Kumu.Hey.

05:37.511 --> 05:39.164
Is everything all right?

05:39.208 --> 05:41.079
Uh, some man named Charlie
just called the house line

05:41.123 --> 05:42.429
looking for Thomas.

05:42.472 --> 05:43.691
Sounded like an emergency.

05:43.734 --> 05:46.389
He said he needed
to see you right away.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.130
Then the phone call cut out.

05:48.173 --> 05:50.524
I-I tried him back right away,
but it went to voice mail.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.526
So this is all you got--
the phone number?

05:52.569 --> 05:54.702
I'm sorry, Thomas.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.578
Oh.

06:01.622 --> 06:03.275
So now you need me.

06:04.842 --> 06:06.104
Can you ping the number?

06:18.987 --> 06:20.118
Front door looks open.

06:30.607 --> 06:32.609
Mr. Owens?

06:33.654 --> 06:35.656
It's Thomas Magnum.

06:36.657 --> 06:37.962
You called?

06:41.009 --> 06:43.011
Mr. Owens?

06:48.146 --> 06:50.671
Thomas Magnum. You called
the house looking for me.

06:50.714 --> 06:51.933
In here.

06:53.761 --> 06:54.762
In here.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.286
Mr. Owens.

06:57.329 --> 06:58.505
I'm locked inside!

06:58.548 --> 07:00.550
Okay, stay back from the door.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.468
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

07:05.512 --> 07:06.948
Leanna?

07:06.991 --> 07:08.776
What happened?
Who locked you in there?

07:08.819 --> 07:10.952
It was my wife. Leanna?

07:10.995 --> 07:12.780
Your wife
locked you in?

07:12.823 --> 07:15.478
She's been acting
a little crazy lately.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.393
Any idea why?

07:17.437 --> 07:20.396
A couple weeks ago the bank
she works at got held up.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.790
She just hasn't been the same
person since it happened.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.095
Uh, the Makai Bank?

07:24.139 --> 07:25.488
I heard about it.
It was all over the news.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.447
The bank manager was killed

07:27.490 --> 07:29.405
'cause he wouldn't let
the robbers into the vault.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.102
That was Albert.
He and Leanna were close.

07:31.146 --> 07:32.843
She took it hard.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.758
Then tonight, I confronted
her over something I saw

07:34.802 --> 07:36.499
on her computer
and she lost it.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.545
She locked me in there.
I did not want the police

07:38.588 --> 07:40.416
to see what was on there,
so I called you.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.939
What was it that you found?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.426
"How to buy a gun
on the black market."

07:50.470 --> 07:52.515
She'd been researching it
for over a week.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.430
Wouldn't tell me why.

07:55.779 --> 07:57.172
The day the bank
got robbed,

07:57.215 --> 07:58.739
she wasn't even supposed
to be there,

07:58.782 --> 08:00.349
but after I stopped working,

08:00.392 --> 08:03.657
she's been picking up
extra shifts.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.703
You can't blame yourself
for what happened.

08:06.747 --> 08:09.924
Mr. Owens... don't worry.

08:09.967 --> 08:11.969
Okay?
We'll find your wife.

08:40.389 --> 08:41.695
Magnum, Leanna was involved

08:41.738 --> 08:42.913
in a bank robbery.

08:42.957 --> 08:44.393
She probably wanted
the gun for protection.

08:44.436 --> 08:45.699
Then why not say that?

08:45.742 --> 08:46.874
And if she wasn't feeling safe,

08:46.917 --> 08:49.006
why leave the safety
of your own home?

08:49.050 --> 08:51.182
Then she locks her
husband in a closet...

08:51.226 --> 08:53.054
None of what she's
doing is making sense.

08:53.097 --> 08:55.317
Well, you won't find
any answers in her financials.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.798
This woman might be the most
boring human on the planet.

08:57.841 --> 08:59.713
Why do you say that?

08:59.756 --> 09:01.715
Well, according
to her debit card bill,

09:01.758 --> 09:05.196
she has lunch at the
Likelike Diner almost every day.

09:05.240 --> 09:08.460
And it's always
for the same amount, $8.25.

09:08.504 --> 09:10.898
Okay, so she's getting
the same thing every time.

09:10.941 --> 09:12.900
Then on Tuesdays,
she takes out $100

09:12.943 --> 09:14.989
from an ATM across town.

09:15.032 --> 09:18.906
Why drive across town to go to
an ATM when you work at a bank?

09:18.949 --> 09:20.081
I don't know,

09:20.124 --> 09:21.343
but it happened like clockwork

09:21.386 --> 09:22.997
until a couple of weeks ago.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.434
Sounds like Leanna's
a creature of habit.

09:25.477 --> 09:27.610
Yeah, like I said: boring.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.743
Okay, we're gonna hop
off, but thanks, Kumu.

09:29.786 --> 09:32.136
I only followed
Miss Higgins' instructions.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.443
Kumu, you make
an excellent hacker.

09:34.486 --> 09:37.185
Just don't tell anyone
with a badge. Aloha.

09:37.228 --> 09:38.578
Aloha.Aloha.

09:40.275 --> 09:42.407
We got to find some way
to get into Leanna's head.

09:44.061 --> 09:46.107
You know, she wouldn't talk
to her husband Charlie

09:46.150 --> 09:48.631
about the robbery, but she
had to talk to the police.

09:54.681 --> 09:55.769
What?

09:55.812 --> 09:56.944
Katsumoto.

09:56.987 --> 09:59.860
Hey, did you get
my macadamia nuts?

09:59.903 --> 10:01.383
Every day
for the last three weeks.

10:01.426 --> 10:02.819
Delicious, right?

10:02.863 --> 10:05.039
Well, I wouldn't know,
since I'm allergic to nuts.

10:05.082 --> 10:08.216
Oh. So, epic fail there, huh?

10:08.259 --> 10:09.739
Not if you were
trying to kill me.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.785
Now, what do you want?
And don't say you need a favor.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.613
Uh, I just need a little
help with something.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.223
I'm ten minutes away.I won't be here.

10:15.266 --> 10:17.094
Uh, please.
I... I-It's important.

10:17.138 --> 10:19.749
I just need you to slip me
a report. It's not a big deal.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.142
I'm hanging up now.

10:21.185 --> 10:23.013
Keep calling me,
I'll book you for stalking.

10:23.057 --> 10:24.624
What do you think--

10:24.667 --> 10:26.277
still mad about
what happened in Myanmar?

10:26.321 --> 10:27.452
Course he is.

10:27.496 --> 10:29.629
Magnum, you were
harboring a fugitive.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.065
I had no choice.

10:31.108 --> 10:32.240
That's rubbish.

10:32.283 --> 10:33.981
You could have told him

10:34.024 --> 10:35.635
exactly what was happening
with Hannah

10:35.678 --> 10:38.028
and trusted him not to say
anything, but you didn't.

10:38.072 --> 10:39.726
And now you're paying the price.

10:47.429 --> 10:48.952
So, that's it?
You're just giving up?

10:48.996 --> 10:51.085
No. I'm gonna go see Rick,
see if one of his HPD buddies

10:51.128 --> 10:52.521
can slip us the report.

10:58.048 --> 11:00.311
How'd you know
I was here?Tracked your phone.

11:04.054 --> 11:06.535
Oh, come on, like you've
never had a panda eye before.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.145
What happened?

11:08.189 --> 11:10.321
Uh, I had to throw down with
some guy at the club last night.

11:10.365 --> 11:11.888
So now you're beating up
your customers.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.368
Is that good for business?

11:13.411 --> 11:14.586
Guy was being a dick.

11:14.630 --> 11:16.023
Said he was an influencer

11:16.066 --> 11:18.547
and because he threw the club
on the 'Gram,

11:18.590 --> 11:20.114
he thought he should
get free drinks.

11:20.157 --> 11:21.768
I'm like, "Hey, Fyre Festival.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.160
All your followers are bots."

11:23.204 --> 11:24.684
And I guess
that got him really upset,

11:24.727 --> 11:26.686
because this millennial
assclown took a swing at me

11:26.729 --> 11:27.817
when I turned
my back.

11:27.861 --> 11:29.123
Anyway, no big deal.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.951
Thanks for bailing me out.
I'll pay you back.

11:30.994 --> 11:31.995
Look, don't worry about it.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.301
Pay us back with a favor.

11:33.344 --> 11:35.651
Oh. So you need something.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.567
Here I was thinking
you actually cared about me.

11:38.610 --> 11:39.873
We do care.Yeah.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.745
We just also happen
to need a favor.

11:48.533 --> 11:51.145
My HPD buddy said
that cell phone video

11:51.188 --> 11:53.147
was taken by one
of the bank hostages.

11:53.190 --> 11:54.365
Okay, there's Leanna.

11:54.409 --> 11:57.499
: You, come with me.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.501
And I assume that
that is Albert Kipono,

11:59.544 --> 12:01.155
Leanna's friend,
the bank manager.

12:02.591 --> 12:05.159
Don't do it. Don't do it.

12:05.202 --> 12:06.900
Please, leave her alone.

12:06.943 --> 12:08.640
I told you, get back down.

12:12.296 --> 12:14.385
What did you do?

12:14.429 --> 12:15.865
Albert! Albert!

12:15.909 --> 12:18.215
Okay, so Albert jumps
into hero mode,

12:18.259 --> 12:21.175
comes to Leanna's defense,
and takes a bullet for it.

12:21.218 --> 12:23.351
That poor woman
must be consumed with guilt.

12:23.394 --> 12:25.527
Yeah. She could be looking
to hurt herself,

12:25.570 --> 12:27.964
which would explain her trying
to get her hands on a gun.

12:31.751 --> 12:32.839
Yes, Kumu?

12:32.882 --> 12:34.362
I think we were wrong.

12:34.405 --> 12:36.799
Leanna's not a creature of habit
after all.

12:36.843 --> 12:39.019
Turns out, this morning,
she withdrew $500

12:39.062 --> 12:41.848
from an ATM
at the Sportsmen's Firing Range.

12:41.891 --> 12:43.850
Shooting range?Kumu, are you sure?

12:43.893 --> 12:45.808
I'm positive.

12:45.852 --> 12:48.680
Okay, well, she's
definitely not thinking suicide.

12:48.724 --> 12:49.856
Why would you go
to a shooting range

12:49.899 --> 12:51.161
if you're trying
to kill yourself?

12:51.205 --> 12:52.859
Yeah, I'm with Thomas.
That'd be weird.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.512
Agreed. So this
isn't about grief

12:54.556 --> 12:56.427
or remorse.Then what's it about?

12:56.471 --> 12:58.299
Leanna lost
someone close to her.

12:58.342 --> 13:01.171
It-it could be
that she feels responsible.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.086
We know she's been distant
from her husband

13:03.130 --> 13:04.305
and intent
on buying a gun.

13:04.348 --> 13:06.263
And-and now she's going
to a firing range?

13:06.307 --> 13:09.832
Which means this isn't about
being suicidal or being scared.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.921
It's about revenge.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.807
Higgy, you mind if
I borrow your phone?

13:27.850 --> 13:28.938
Got to call Abby.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.331
What's wrong with your phone?

13:30.374 --> 13:31.593
Battery's dead.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.169
Hey, Abby. It's Thomas.

13:42.212 --> 13:45.215
Just wanted to call and see if
you had finished Robin's book.

13:45.259 --> 13:46.695
Hit me up when you're free.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.044
Okay.

13:48.088 --> 13:49.741
"Hit me up when you're free."

13:49.785 --> 13:51.874
Wow, you really do
speak in poetry.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.572
It's no wonder Abby
finds you irresistible.

13:54.616 --> 13:55.791
Don't be jealous.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.314
Look, some guy
will be asking you

13:57.358 --> 13:58.750
to hit him up
when you're free

13:58.794 --> 14:00.230
when, I don't know,

14:00.274 --> 14:01.841
hell freezes over.

14:01.884 --> 14:02.842
Sorry to keep you waiting.

14:02.885 --> 14:06.367
So, how can I help you?

14:06.410 --> 14:09.370
Wanted to know if you
recognize this woman.

14:10.414 --> 14:11.720
Name's Leanna.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.853
Yeah, she was in
this morning.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.333
She's actually been coming in
a lot the last two weeks.

14:16.377 --> 14:18.161
Why are you asking about her?

14:18.205 --> 14:19.510
Because, as of last night,

14:19.554 --> 14:21.077
she was reported missing.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.601
Well, she seemed fine
this morning.

14:25.473 --> 14:26.604
That's a nice watch.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.780
It's a Rolex,
right?

14:28.824 --> 14:30.043
Uh, yeah.

14:30.086 --> 14:31.740
It's pretty sharp.

14:31.783 --> 14:32.784
How long have you had it?

14:32.828 --> 14:34.438
Not that long.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.049
You mind if I...
check it out?

14:36.092 --> 14:37.920
I'm kind of
a Rolex guy myself.Yeah, I'm sorry,

14:37.964 --> 14:39.879
I really got to get back.You know what's funny
about that watch?

14:40.923 --> 14:42.098
Is that watch

14:42.142 --> 14:44.013
looks...

14:44.057 --> 14:46.494
like this watch.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.454
So it would appear you're
wearing a timepiece that belongs

14:50.498 --> 14:53.240
to a now missingwoman.

14:53.283 --> 14:54.937
I'm sure you can appreciate
how that looks.

14:54.981 --> 14:58.158
Perhaps you'd like to talk
to us, as opposed to HPD.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.598
It was compensation.

15:03.641 --> 15:04.904
Okay?

15:04.947 --> 15:06.949
She wanted to buy a gun,
some ammo.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.516
Under the table.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.520
Daily target practice
and an untraceable gun. I mean,

15:12.563 --> 15:15.175
I would say that revenge is
a pretty solid theory right now.

15:15.218 --> 15:17.307
Yeah, but Leanna would have
to know who these thieves are.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.570
And like everybody else in the
bank, she couldn't identify 'em.

15:19.614 --> 15:22.312
But sometimes witnesses
recall details after the fact.

15:22.356 --> 15:23.966
It's possible that Leanna
remembered something

15:24.010 --> 15:26.490
that was said or something
that she saw that day

15:26.534 --> 15:28.231
that helped her
identify the men.

15:28.275 --> 15:29.929
You know what I keep
bumping up on though?

15:29.972 --> 15:31.452
Is why did she alert
the authorities.

15:31.495 --> 15:34.194
I mean, uh, she decides to
go after these guys herself

15:34.237 --> 15:35.325
and get some payback?

15:35.369 --> 15:36.848
I mean, she's, like,
an ordinary citizen.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.154
I know it sounds
like a stretch,

15:38.198 --> 15:40.069
but Leanna
felt responsible

15:40.113 --> 15:42.028
for what happened
to Albert Kipono.

15:42.071 --> 15:44.421
A loss like that
can cut so deep

15:44.465 --> 15:48.077
that Leanna might have felt
compelled to do something,

15:48.121 --> 15:50.166
no matter
how irrational,

15:50.210 --> 15:51.689
no matter the cost.

15:51.733 --> 15:53.865
Higgins has
some personal experience

15:53.909 --> 15:55.345
when it comes to revenge,

15:55.389 --> 15:58.348
so my gut is telling me
to trust her on this one.

16:00.655 --> 16:01.961
What's that?

16:02.004 --> 16:03.049
Text from Kumu.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.615
Leanna just bought
a new cell phone.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.008
Can you ping
her location?

16:06.052 --> 16:07.488
Yeah.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.447
She's half a mile
from the airport.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.710
That's 30 minutes,
45 with traffic.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.277
We're definitely gonna
need some backup.

16:28.074 --> 16:29.727
Your girl's in there.

16:31.164 --> 16:33.644
What's she doing
in a tattoo shop?

16:33.688 --> 16:36.299
That's for you to find out,
my brother.

16:36.343 --> 16:37.866
I got customers waiting.

16:37.909 --> 16:39.824
People that pay me for my time.

16:39.868 --> 16:40.825
Later.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.100
You wait here.

16:54.143 --> 16:55.536
I'm gonna go do some recon.

16:55.579 --> 16:57.059
I'm coming with you.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.756
I don't think it's a good idea.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.236
You stick out.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.498
How do you figure?

17:01.542 --> 17:03.587
Well, you don't look
like the kind of person

17:03.631 --> 17:06.112
that would think about getting
a tattoo, much less have one.

17:06.155 --> 17:08.201
Huh. Well,
that shows how much you know.

17:08.243 --> 17:10.203
I actually happen
to have a tattoo.

17:10.246 --> 17:12.596
No, I've seen you in a
sports bra and a swimsuit.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.250
I did not see a tattoo.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.992
And where it is, you never will.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.825
Yeah, she was here
a few minutes ago.

17:23.867 --> 17:26.219
Left out the back.

17:26.262 --> 17:27.959
She must've seen TC tailing her.

17:28.002 --> 17:29.265
Yeah. It's
hard not to.

17:29.309 --> 17:30.614
He was driving that
rainbow on wheels.

17:30.658 --> 17:31.963
It's not like
he blends in.

17:32.007 --> 17:34.096
Says the P.I.
who drives a Ferrari.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.185
What did she want?

17:36.229 --> 17:37.621
She came in asking
about some ink

17:37.665 --> 17:39.101
she saw on some guy
she met recently.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.103
Showed me a sketch
that she made of it.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.626
Asked me if the work
was done here.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.106
Was it?

17:44.150 --> 17:47.283
Yeah. One of Dex's clients.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.591
A guy named
Colin Wells.

17:50.634 --> 17:54.595
Any idea why she was interested
in this particular tattoo?

17:54.638 --> 17:56.466
Said she met a guy
at the bar last week.

17:56.510 --> 17:58.773
Said they were vibing, but
she didn't get his number.

17:58.816 --> 17:59.861
Said she'd been
hitting up the parlors

17:59.904 --> 18:00.949
up and down
the south shore

18:00.992 --> 18:02.298
to see if any of 'em
done the art

18:02.342 --> 18:03.343
and knew how
to find the guy.

18:03.386 --> 18:04.996
Excuse me.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.998
It had to be one of the men
in the bank with that tattoo.

18:07.042 --> 18:08.478
And that's how Leanna's
trying to track them.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.350
Yeah-- Please tell me
you didn't give her

18:10.393 --> 18:11.568
that guy's information.

18:11.612 --> 18:13.179
She gave me a hundred
dollars cash.

18:14.223 --> 18:16.007
We're gonna need that info.

18:16.051 --> 18:17.008
Thank you.

18:17.052 --> 18:18.532
I asked one of
my old MI6 buddies

18:18.575 --> 18:19.794
to run the name
Colin Wells.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.012
It appears
he has a record.

18:21.056 --> 18:22.666
Multiple B&E's and
spent time in Halawa.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.233
He's got to be one
of the thieves.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.757
We got to find him
before she finds Wells.

18:29.369 --> 18:30.544
You guys get what you need?

18:30.587 --> 18:31.632
Yeah.

18:31.675 --> 18:34.765
Would you mind
not leaning on the car?

18:34.809 --> 18:38.682
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

18:38.726 --> 18:41.076
Forgive me.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.947
Might I suggest
you remove your arse

18:42.991 --> 18:45.385
from the hood of the car
before I do it for you?

18:45.428 --> 18:47.256
How come so many people
are interested

18:47.300 --> 18:48.388
in one of my clients?

18:48.431 --> 18:49.737
I believe we asked you kindly

18:49.780 --> 18:51.565
to remove yourself
from the motorcar.

18:51.608 --> 18:55.308
Happy?
Now answer my question.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.310
You know, honesty, it's...

18:57.353 --> 18:58.833
it's none of your business.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.403
Maybe you guys'll
be more talkative

19:03.446 --> 19:04.969
with a gun to your head.

19:15.066 --> 19:17.025
You know, I think we got
off on the wrong foot.

19:17.068 --> 19:19.070
To be honest, I'm
a private investigator.

19:19.114 --> 19:20.115
This is my trainee.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.509
Uh, I am not your trainee.

19:22.552 --> 19:23.684
Fine. Intern.

19:23.727 --> 19:25.686
I am definitely not that.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.514
Well, you're not on the payroll,
and you're not my partner,

19:27.557 --> 19:28.819
so what are you?Okay, what is your

19:28.863 --> 19:30.343
obsession with me
becoming your partner?

19:30.386 --> 19:31.866
What obsession?
It's not an obsession.Oh, please.

19:31.909 --> 19:32.954
Pushing and pushing,
I mean,

19:32.997 --> 19:34.521
why is it so
incredibly important?

19:34.564 --> 19:36.000
You want me to tell
you what's important?Uh, yes,

19:36.044 --> 19:37.088
am I being too subtle?

19:38.438 --> 19:39.917
I think I'm better
at my job withyou

19:39.961 --> 19:41.049
than I am withoutyou.

19:41.092 --> 19:43.225
Really?

19:43.269 --> 19:44.835
Yes! There.
I said it.

19:44.879 --> 19:47.098
You two lovebirds
done yet?

19:47.838 --> 19:49.753
Almost.

19:54.889 --> 19:56.151
Stop, stop,
let him go.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.587
He's gonna warn Wells!Leanna's probably going

19:57.631 --> 19:59.154
after Wells right now.
We got to stop her. Come on.

20:02.679 --> 20:05.247
There. That's Wells's
house on the right.

20:07.118 --> 20:09.599
According to Leanna's
cell phone, she's still here.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.660
It's Wells.

20:29.140 --> 20:30.925
Magnum,
she's still here.

20:32.796 --> 20:34.407
Higgins?

20:35.625 --> 20:38.237
Go around.Yeah.

20:55.166 --> 20:57.430
Drop the gun!Who are you?

20:57.473 --> 20:59.693
My name is Thomas Magnum.
I'm a private investigator.

20:59.736 --> 21:02.304
Please...
put down the gun.

21:02.348 --> 21:03.566
No-- Hold on,
she's with me!

21:03.610 --> 21:04.915
It's okay, Leanna.

21:04.959 --> 21:06.874
How do you know my name?

21:07.875 --> 21:08.963
Charlie hired us.

21:09.006 --> 21:10.791
What?

21:10.834 --> 21:12.836
We know you came here
to kill Wells.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.012
But I didn't kill him.

21:15.056 --> 21:16.318
He was already dead
when I got here.

21:16.362 --> 21:17.537
You have blood
on your hands.

21:18.668 --> 21:21.192
Because I was trying
to save him.

21:26.023 --> 21:30.158
Leanna... I believe you.

21:30.201 --> 21:31.551
You're just saying that.

21:31.594 --> 21:32.987
No. I'm not.

21:33.030 --> 21:34.684
Look, Dex, the guy
from the tattoo shop,

21:34.728 --> 21:36.338
he let you leave
with Wells' address

21:36.382 --> 21:37.818
because he knew
he was already dead.

21:37.861 --> 21:39.036
What are you
talking about?

21:39.080 --> 21:40.690
One of the men
in the last tattoo shops

21:40.734 --> 21:43.693
you visited... we think
he's connected to the thieves.

21:43.737 --> 21:46.914
So now he and the third member
of the robbery team

21:46.957 --> 21:48.263
know that you're trying
to find them.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.047
You're in danger.

21:50.091 --> 21:51.745
Okay, we need to keep you safe.

21:51.788 --> 21:53.486
Listen to me, please.

21:53.529 --> 21:55.879
Two hours ago, you had
the advantage of surprise.

21:55.923 --> 21:58.447
Which might have given you
a chance at pulling this off,

21:58.491 --> 22:00.449
despite your inexperience.
But now they know.

22:00.493 --> 22:01.885
They're going to find you,

22:01.929 --> 22:03.844
and they are going
to try to kill you.

22:05.454 --> 22:07.500
And we don't want
that to happen.

22:07.543 --> 22:09.502
Look at me.
Leanna...

22:09.545 --> 22:11.982
I understand why
you're doing this.

22:12.026 --> 22:13.810
No, you don't.

22:13.854 --> 22:15.856
You couldn't possibly.

22:17.292 --> 22:19.947
You're wrong. You're wrong.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.992
Now, please, just
put the gun down.

22:23.516 --> 22:25.344
And let us help you.

22:27.128 --> 22:28.434
You can trust us.

22:29.913 --> 22:31.567
It's okay.

22:31.611 --> 22:32.786
It's okay.

22:37.138 --> 22:38.400
It's okay.

22:38.444 --> 22:42.317
It's okay.
It's okay.

22:47.888 --> 22:50.020
Show me.

22:50.064 --> 22:52.196
Really good to be working
with you again, Katsumoto.

22:53.241 --> 22:55.461
So, who's this
woman you're after?

22:55.504 --> 22:57.419
Gonna find out anyway.

22:57.463 --> 22:58.768
Leanna Owens.

22:58.812 --> 23:00.379
The assistant manager
from the bank?

23:00.422 --> 23:03.425
Yeah. Yeah, she was
looking for payback.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.602
And where is Mrs. Owens?

23:06.646 --> 23:08.169
She's with Higgins right now.

23:08.212 --> 23:09.823
TC flew her back
to Robin's Nest.

23:09.866 --> 23:12.434
You just let your friends
take off with a suspect?

23:12.478 --> 23:14.262
She didn't shoot this guy.
He was shot with a .45.

23:14.305 --> 23:16.438
She had a .38. Plus,
I checked her weapon.

23:16.482 --> 23:17.657
It hadn't been fired.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.049
Great, you're telling me

23:19.093 --> 23:20.660
you touched evidence
from a murder case.

23:20.703 --> 23:23.619
Well, it's not evidence
if she didn't pull the trigger.

23:23.663 --> 23:25.447
You know, I love how you
decided that on your own.

23:25.491 --> 23:26.753
Let's get our roles straight.

23:26.796 --> 23:28.363
I investigate crimes
and clear suspects.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.365
And I...Get in my way.

23:32.628 --> 23:35.501
You want to know what I think?

23:35.544 --> 23:36.980
Not really.

23:37.024 --> 23:39.592
One of his two accomplices
pulled the trigger.

23:39.635 --> 23:41.376
Okay. Why?

23:41.420 --> 23:43.639
Couldn't have been about money.
They didn't get away with any.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.380
Yeah, but maybe they blamed that
on Wells.

23:45.424 --> 23:48.165
Or-or maybe they thought
he was gonna roll on them.

23:49.210 --> 23:50.820
All right, let's start
from the beginning.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.474
How did Leanna end up here?

23:52.518 --> 23:54.781
She tracked him down herself
through Wells's tattoo.

23:54.824 --> 23:57.348
Actually, the artist who
did the work, this guy Dex,

23:57.392 --> 23:59.350
we think he's one
of the bank robbers.

23:59.394 --> 24:02.223
He works at a place called Iron
Body Tattoo out by the airport.

24:02.266 --> 24:03.964
You're definitely gonna
want to check this guy out.

24:04.007 --> 24:06.619
Really? Is that
what I should do?

24:06.662 --> 24:08.708
Look, I'm just trying to help.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.975
Hold up. Let me see your hands.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.153
You wash them?No.

24:19.196 --> 24:21.503
Then who touched this guy?
I got blood smear and prints.

24:21.547 --> 24:23.331
Leanna.

24:23.374 --> 24:25.028
You mean the woman
who might have shot him?

24:25.072 --> 24:26.813
I'm telling you,
she didn't shoot this guy.

24:26.856 --> 24:29.250
Magnum, leave before I arrest
you for giving me a migraine.

24:29.293 --> 24:31.252
That's not even an
arrestable offense.Go.

24:37.954 --> 24:39.303
I didn't tell the police

24:39.347 --> 24:41.480
about the tattoo
because I was scared.

24:42.524 --> 24:45.179
The man who shot Albert
had threatened me.

24:45.222 --> 24:48.443
Said they knew where I lived.No doubt they'd
scouted the bank,

24:48.487 --> 24:51.141
done their homework on
you and your coworkers.

24:51.185 --> 24:54.667
They said they'd kill Charlie
if I talked to the HPD.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.190
I told myself at first

24:56.233 --> 24:58.671
I was doing the smart thing,
staying quiet.

24:58.714 --> 25:00.063
But after a few days,

25:00.107 --> 25:02.109
I decided
I couldn't just do nothing.

25:04.764 --> 25:07.810
But I also didn't want
to put Charlie at risk.

25:09.290 --> 25:12.032
It took a lot of guts
to do what you did.

25:13.555 --> 25:16.515
But had you had followed through
with your revenge mission,

25:16.558 --> 25:18.691
life as you know it...

25:18.734 --> 25:20.867
would have been over.

25:23.217 --> 25:26.176
Vendettas have...

25:26.220 --> 25:29.179
life-changing consequences.

25:42.453 --> 25:43.672
Maybe it's being alone
in the car

25:43.716 --> 25:45.500
with a long drive back
to Robin's Nest,

25:45.544 --> 25:47.023
but my little voice
was telling me that

25:47.067 --> 25:49.678
Katsumoto may not have been
wrong suspecting Leanna.

25:49.722 --> 25:51.506
I still don't think
she killed Wells,

25:51.550 --> 25:54.248
but something about the blood
on her hands wasn't adding up.

25:54.291 --> 25:57.556
If Leanna wanted Wells dead,
then why try to save him?

25:57.599 --> 26:00.297
I can really only think
of one reason.

26:00.341 --> 26:02.473
Hello?Hey, Kumu, it's me.

26:02.517 --> 26:06.042
Uh, you mentioned Leanna takes
100 bucks a week out of an ATM.

26:06.086 --> 26:09.393
Do you have any idea
where that's located?

26:45.908 --> 26:47.214
Need a room?

26:47.257 --> 26:49.042
No, actually, just...

26:49.085 --> 26:50.957
a little information.

26:54.743 --> 26:58.617
Have you seen this woman?

26:58.660 --> 27:01.228
Yeah. Leanna.

27:01.271 --> 27:04.057
She was coming in
once a week for a while.

27:04.100 --> 27:05.449
But not with him.

27:06.537 --> 27:07.626
Okay.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.671
What about this guy?

27:09.715 --> 27:11.499
Yeah.

27:11.542 --> 27:13.501
That's lover boy.

27:15.111 --> 27:17.070
When a theory proves true,

27:17.113 --> 27:19.594
it usually feels pretty good.

27:19.638 --> 27:20.943
But not today.

27:31.693 --> 27:32.781
Leanna Owens,
stand up, please.

27:32.825 --> 27:34.087
What's going on?

27:34.130 --> 27:35.436
Turn around.
Put your hands behind your back.

27:35.479 --> 27:36.567
But wait, I didn't kill him.

27:36.611 --> 27:38.700
Maybe not,
but you're still under arrest.

27:38.744 --> 27:40.659
Leanna, we know what you did.
We know about Wells.

27:40.702 --> 27:42.922
You know that diner
you used to go to every day?

27:42.965 --> 27:44.140
Wells worked there, right?

27:44.184 --> 27:45.925
That's where you met him.
You fell for him.

27:45.968 --> 27:47.970
He offered you an escape
from your everyday life.

27:48.014 --> 27:49.798
And then at some point,
you two hatched a plan

27:49.842 --> 27:51.191
to rob a bank.

27:51.234 --> 27:52.975
He said he knew
a couple of guys that can help,

27:53.019 --> 27:54.411
and, I-I don't know,
maybe it was

27:54.455 --> 27:55.978
their idea.
Maybe they had him seduce you.

27:56.022 --> 27:57.545
But either way,
you went along with it.

27:57.588 --> 28:00.417
Soon as the plan went sideways,
your boyfriend disappeared.

28:00.461 --> 28:02.332
Go ahead and stop me
whenever you want.

28:03.769 --> 28:06.772
Uh, speaking for myself,
can you keep going?

28:06.815 --> 28:08.164
I'd like to know
what happened.

28:08.208 --> 28:09.165
Same here.

28:09.209 --> 28:10.253
Yeah, me, too.

28:10.297 --> 28:11.733
She wanted to go after
her accomplices.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.866
Problem was Wells never
introduced her to his partners.

28:13.909 --> 28:15.737
And because they always met
at a motel,

28:15.781 --> 28:18.131
she never knew
where Wells lived.

28:18.174 --> 28:19.959
Then she used his tattoo
to track him down.

28:20.002 --> 28:22.048
Then you tipped off Dex,
and he...

28:22.091 --> 28:23.832
called the third guy up,
had him put a bullet in Wells

28:23.876 --> 28:24.877
right before you got there.

28:27.575 --> 28:30.709
He promised
no one was gonna get hurt.

28:35.452 --> 28:37.150
Let's go.

28:42.938 --> 28:45.071
Wait, hold-hold up.
It's her husband, Charlie.

28:46.594 --> 28:48.030
Hey, Charlie.

28:48.074 --> 28:49.379
How's it going?

28:49.423 --> 28:50.554
Did you find Leanna?

28:50.598 --> 28:52.034
Yeah. Yeah, she's okay.

28:52.078 --> 28:54.036
But I'd like
to talk to you in person.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.082
Charlie isn't at
home, Mr. Magnum.

28:56.125 --> 28:58.214
Charlie, who's there with you?

28:59.259 --> 29:01.348
Please! Don't-don't hurt him.

29:01.391 --> 29:03.742
Oh, don't worry.
Your man's gonna be okay

29:03.785 --> 29:06.222
as long as everyone cooperates.What do you want?

29:06.266 --> 29:07.746
This is Detective Katsumoto.MAN:
You look like a smart guy...

29:07.789 --> 29:09.095
I need a trace on a cellular.

29:09.138 --> 29:10.531
There was 20 million sitting
in that bank vault

29:10.574 --> 29:11.662
that should've been ours.

29:11.706 --> 29:13.447
As far as we know,
it's still there.

29:13.490 --> 29:14.796
See where I'm going with this?

29:14.840 --> 29:16.406
You want us to get it for you.

29:16.450 --> 29:18.408
Not you. Her.

29:18.452 --> 29:19.801
She's gonna go
into the bank at noon,

29:19.845 --> 29:22.717
fill a backpack
with as much cash as it'll hold.

29:22.761 --> 29:25.241
Benjis only.
No dye packs, no bait money.

29:25.285 --> 29:27.243
Now, once Leanna's
got the money,

29:27.287 --> 29:29.680
she's gonna leave the bank
and get in her car.

29:29.724 --> 29:31.247
We'll call and tell her
where to drop the money.

29:31.291 --> 29:34.076
And if I see
anyone following Leanna,

29:34.120 --> 29:35.991
what do you think will happen
to our friend Charlie here?

29:36.035 --> 29:36.905
You'll hurt him.

29:36.949 --> 29:38.341
That's a little vague.

29:38.385 --> 29:39.560
Let's try one more time.

29:40.604 --> 29:42.302
You'll kill him.

29:42.345 --> 29:44.739
Gold star, Mr. Magnum.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.741
Gold star.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.265
Anything?

29:49.309 --> 29:50.832
They weren't on long enough.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.181
Okay. So, what now?

29:52.225 --> 29:54.618
12:00 noon.
That's 30 minutes from now.

29:54.662 --> 29:55.706
Doesn't give us much time.

29:55.750 --> 29:56.838
They did that intentionally.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.144
They knew the deadline
would preclude

29:58.187 --> 29:59.928
any large-scale HPD involvement.

29:59.972 --> 30:02.452
Which means our best move
is to wait for the deadline,

30:02.496 --> 30:03.802
then ask for more time.

30:03.845 --> 30:05.368
Yeah, there's no way
they're gonna go for that.

30:05.412 --> 30:06.892
Thomas?

30:06.935 --> 30:08.110
Hey.

30:08.154 --> 30:10.025
Abby.

30:10.069 --> 30:12.593
I just came by
to return your book.

30:12.636 --> 30:14.900
And maybe
to steal you for lunch.

30:14.943 --> 30:16.031
Everything all right?

30:16.075 --> 30:18.120
Actually, uh,
now's not the best time.

30:18.164 --> 30:19.643
I have a situation
with a client.

30:19.687 --> 30:21.471
Could-could you just
give me a minute?

30:21.515 --> 30:23.647
Listen, right now,
these guys want to disappear,

30:23.691 --> 30:25.127
and that means
money. Big money.

30:25.171 --> 30:27.956
Money that Leanna can get
from the bank. They'll wait.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.218
You hope.

30:29.262 --> 30:30.480
Let me do it.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.439
This is all my fault.

30:32.482 --> 30:34.484
Albert's dead because of me.
I can't let them hurt Charlie.

30:34.528 --> 30:35.659
Let me go in.

30:35.703 --> 30:37.313
Out of the question.If-if you don't,

30:37.357 --> 30:39.750
and they refuse to extend
the deadline, Charlie dies.

30:39.794 --> 30:41.361
Look, let her
get the cash

30:41.404 --> 30:44.103
u-uh, take it to them, w-we can
monitor from a distance.

30:44.146 --> 30:46.322
Magnum, you can't be serious.
This woman is a criminal.

30:46.366 --> 30:47.889
You want me
to let her rob a bank

30:47.933 --> 30:49.238
that she tried
to rob once before?

30:49.282 --> 30:51.197
It wouldn't be robbing a bank.

30:51.240 --> 30:54.853
It would be a temporary loan
unbeknownst to the institution.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.419
That won't hold up in court.

30:56.463 --> 30:58.160
Thank you.
But the insanity
defense might work.

30:58.204 --> 31:01.033
Although, the burden of proof
would be on the defendant.

31:01.076 --> 31:02.556
All due respect, Counselor,
I'm gonna take this idea

31:02.599 --> 31:04.601
off the table.Okay.

31:04.645 --> 31:06.777
This is the only idea
that should be on the table.

31:06.821 --> 31:08.040
Even if I was inclined,

31:08.083 --> 31:10.042
we would need eyes
in the bank and outside.

31:10.085 --> 31:12.522
That's a surveillance team,
that's 30 cops.

31:12.566 --> 31:14.394
It would take days to set up
an op like that.

31:14.437 --> 31:16.918
We have minutes.Me and Rick will help.

31:16.962 --> 31:17.963
Yeah, I'm game.

31:18.006 --> 31:19.965
There you go. Aerial support.

31:20.008 --> 31:21.357
This is crazy.

31:21.401 --> 31:23.055
If you have a-a better idea
that doesn't involve

31:23.098 --> 31:24.708
waiting out the clock,
I'm listening.

31:24.752 --> 31:26.885
There are a thousand ways
this could go wrong.

31:26.928 --> 31:29.409
Yeah. This is not a great plan,
but we have 30 minutes,

31:29.452 --> 31:31.715
and this is the only plan
we have.

31:33.065 --> 31:34.283
Let's go.

31:55.130 --> 31:57.176
Leanna's heading for the vault.

31:58.655 --> 32:01.920
TC, Rick, you guys in position?

32:03.660 --> 32:05.836
Right above you, bro.

32:28.163 --> 32:30.035
Leanna's heading for the exit.

32:31.558 --> 32:34.300
You've been filling that deposit
slip out for 15 minutes.

32:34.343 --> 32:35.736
I have early arthritis.

32:35.779 --> 32:38.521
You think I'm stupid, cop?

32:41.568 --> 32:44.484
That van is blocking the exit.

32:44.527 --> 32:46.312
This can't be a coincidence.

32:46.355 --> 32:49.184
Katsumoto, do not
let her leave the bank.

32:51.056 --> 32:53.014
Katsumoto?

32:56.061 --> 32:57.236
Get in the van.

32:58.715 --> 33:01.022
Get in the van or Charlie dies.

33:04.069 --> 33:06.027
Charlie.

33:06.071 --> 33:08.029
Get in.

33:16.255 --> 33:18.822
Gordon, do you copy?

33:18.866 --> 33:20.128
Where are you?!

33:20.172 --> 33:21.738
Respond, damn it!

33:30.486 --> 33:31.748
They've got Leanna!
She's in the van!

33:31.792 --> 33:33.315
Yeah, I see 'em.What did I tell you, Magnum?

33:33.359 --> 33:35.622
Katsumoto was right.

33:35.665 --> 33:38.277
There were a thousand ways
this could have gone wrong.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.583
And now we only have one chance to make it right.

33:49.375 --> 33:50.419
Guys, we got him.

33:50.463 --> 33:53.074
Van's moving north on Ward.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.381
They just hung a left
on Prospect.

33:55.424 --> 33:57.383
Don't lose him!

34:20.449 --> 34:22.060
Where's that van?

34:22.103 --> 34:24.279
He just turned right
off of Prospect.

34:26.281 --> 34:27.587
I need you to get me
in front of it.

34:27.630 --> 34:29.458
Then what are you gonna do?

34:29.502 --> 34:31.243
I don't know,
just get me ahead of it.

34:31.286 --> 34:32.331
Take a right, now.

34:41.862 --> 34:44.777
Okay, you've got an alley
about 20 yards to your right.

34:48.434 --> 34:51.045
Good, now make the next left.

34:56.616 --> 34:58.792
All right. Here you go.
You're gaining on him.

35:15.504 --> 35:17.115
Okay, brother,
whatcha gonna do now?

35:24.078 --> 35:25.775
Thomas, what the hell
are you doing?

36:30.188 --> 36:31.580
Come on, Leanna.

36:35.105 --> 36:36.542
Wait, what are you doing?

36:36.585 --> 36:38.892
I'm sorry, Charlie.

36:38.935 --> 36:40.633
I'm so sorry.

36:43.592 --> 36:45.464
What is going on, Mr. Magnum?

36:53.472 --> 36:57.258
I had someone
in my life once.

36:57.302 --> 36:59.652
Someone who hurt me.

36:59.695 --> 37:02.002
And that pain you're feeling,
you're gonna,

37:02.045 --> 37:04.396
you're gonna carry it with you
for a long time.

37:04.439 --> 37:06.224
But you're gonna
get up every day

37:06.267 --> 37:08.226
and you're gonna
move forward.

37:10.184 --> 37:12.273
You'll look back...

37:12.317 --> 37:14.971
a lot.

37:15.015 --> 37:16.582
But you're also
gonna move on.

37:19.585 --> 37:22.631
And look, if you ever
need a friend,

37:22.675 --> 37:24.024
I'll always pick up.

37:24.067 --> 37:27.984
He's not just
a good investigator, is he?

37:29.290 --> 37:33.425
He's... compassionate.

37:33.468 --> 37:35.992
Yes, he is.

37:38.343 --> 37:40.823
You know, when I was first
getting to know him,

37:40.867 --> 37:43.696
I thought this job was just
a paycheck for Magnum.

37:43.739 --> 37:45.001
Or a diversion.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.397
But I soon realized that he

37:49.441 --> 37:52.313
genuinely wants to help people.

38:00.539 --> 38:02.802
I'm sorry,
I have to go.

38:02.845 --> 38:04.107
Would you tell Thomas

38:04.151 --> 38:05.370
I had to take care
of something?
Yeah.

38:23.126 --> 38:24.693
You okay?

38:24.737 --> 38:26.739
Yeah.

38:28.131 --> 38:30.133
You doing anything later?

38:38.620 --> 38:39.795
Higgins ever give you an answer

38:39.839 --> 38:41.231
on your partnership offer?

38:41.275 --> 38:43.582
No, but I think
I'm wearing her down.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.279
Answer's probably
gonna be "yes."

38:45.323 --> 38:46.541
Good.

38:46.585 --> 38:48.064
You guys make
a good team.

38:48.108 --> 38:49.544
Thank you.

38:49.588 --> 38:50.893
You finished the,
uh, book, right?

38:50.937 --> 38:51.894
Yeah, I did.

38:51.938 --> 38:53.809
And?
It was great.

38:53.853 --> 38:55.811
But I have a hard time believing
any of it actually happened.

38:55.855 --> 38:57.073
Really?

38:57.117 --> 38:58.727
Even that part
where the White Knight jumps out

38:58.771 --> 39:00.338
of the convertible
onto the helicopter skid?

39:00.381 --> 39:02.905
Yeah,
especially that part.

39:02.949 --> 39:04.907
I have to say, though,
I thought the character

39:04.951 --> 39:07.214
of the White Knight was,
you know, too good to be true.

39:07.257 --> 39:08.955
Heroes like that
don't exist.

39:08.998 --> 39:12.219
But... after what
you did today,

39:12.262 --> 39:14.352
and then afterwards when you
were talking to Charlie,

39:14.395 --> 39:16.397
let's just say the
White Knight's got nothing

39:16.441 --> 39:18.007
on you, Thomas Magnum.

39:18.051 --> 39:19.792
Thank you.

39:21.271 --> 39:23.448
Hi.
Hey.
What's up, guys?

39:23.491 --> 39:25.145
Hey, how are you?
Kumu.

39:25.188 --> 39:26.189
Lookin' good.

39:26.233 --> 39:27.800
Where's Higgie?KUMU: Mm.

39:27.843 --> 39:29.236
She said she'd be down
in a few minutes.

39:29.279 --> 39:31.760
I texted Katsumoto,
but, eh, didn't hear back.

39:31.804 --> 39:34.023
Surprise, surprise.RICK: Okay, all right.

39:34.067 --> 39:35.285
Everybody quiet
down for a sec.

39:35.329 --> 39:36.678
I have a big
announcement to make.

39:36.722 --> 39:39.986
Um, last night, a profound
thing happened to me,

39:40.029 --> 39:41.596
which forced me to
take stock in my life.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.599
You talking
about getting arrested?Yes.

39:44.643 --> 39:46.471
It had a very big effect
on me, all right?

39:46.514 --> 39:47.820
I'm not made for jail.

39:47.863 --> 39:48.995
You all know that.

39:49.038 --> 39:50.605
Look, it was a big
wake-up call.

39:50.649 --> 39:53.216
All right? And-and after
thinking about it a lot,

39:53.260 --> 39:55.741
I've decided that...

39:55.784 --> 39:57.917
I am gonna quit
the King Kamehameha Club.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.135
Really?

39:59.179 --> 40:00.354
What are you gonna
do for money?

40:00.398 --> 40:02.312
I have no idea.

40:02.356 --> 40:04.445
Well, you're a bright boy,
you'll figure it out.

40:04.489 --> 40:05.968
Thank you very much.

40:06.012 --> 40:07.796
Oh, I did get
a court date, however,

40:07.840 --> 40:09.189
which means I'm gonna need
a lawyer.

40:09.232 --> 40:10.625
Are you cheap?

40:10.669 --> 40:13.019
$700 an hour.Ah.

40:13.062 --> 40:15.543
Wow.But, for the unemployed,
pro bono.

40:15.587 --> 40:17.153
Great.

40:17.197 --> 40:18.546
"Pro bono,"
that means free, right?

40:18.590 --> 40:20.896
Yes. It means free.

40:20.940 --> 40:23.116
Hello, everybody.

40:23.159 --> 40:24.465
Hey.Want a brew?

40:24.509 --> 40:26.249
No, thanks.
Actually, I can't stay.

40:26.293 --> 40:27.468
I have a plane to catch.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.470
Mm, okay.
Where are you going?

40:29.514 --> 40:32.952
London.Everything okay?

40:32.995 --> 40:35.345
Yeah, it's fine.
I'll be back in a few days.

40:35.389 --> 40:37.435
I just wanted to say
a quick goodbye to everyone.

40:37.478 --> 40:39.785
Have a good trip, Jules.Thanks.

40:39.828 --> 40:42.309
Give the queen my best.

40:42.352 --> 40:44.442
:
Tally ho, old boy, tally ho.I'll be right back.

40:44.485 --> 40:45.747
No, they don't
say "tally ho."

40:45.791 --> 40:46.748
They don't?RICK: No.

40:46.792 --> 40:48.315
Higgins.Yeah.

40:49.664 --> 40:50.709
What's going on in London?

40:50.752 --> 40:53.538
Family matters.
Nothing exciting.

40:53.581 --> 40:55.191
Horrible liar.

40:55.235 --> 40:56.932
Liar?You're meeting with MI6.

40:56.976 --> 40:57.977
MI6?

40:58.020 --> 40:59.587
Repeating everything I say

40:59.631 --> 41:01.371
isn't gonna get you out
of answering the question.

41:01.415 --> 41:02.808
They want you back.

41:02.851 --> 41:04.505
That's why you've
been having trouble

41:04.549 --> 41:05.898
committing to
our partnership.

41:05.941 --> 41:08.422
Okay, how do you know that?

41:08.466 --> 41:10.119
There were several
calls between your cell

41:10.163 --> 41:11.773
and a blocked number,
which I traced back

41:11.817 --> 41:13.688
to an SIS building
in Central London.

41:13.732 --> 41:15.168
You checked my call log

41:15.211 --> 41:16.822
when you borrowed
my phone to call Abby.

41:16.865 --> 41:19.215
I had to. Something was going on
and you wouldn't tell me what.

41:19.259 --> 41:20.521
So you invade my privacy.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.392
Look, I can't say
I'm surprised.

41:22.436 --> 41:24.525
After you took down Viper, I
figured it was a matter of time

41:24.569 --> 41:26.571
before you were back in
Her Majesty's good graces.

41:28.616 --> 41:30.052
Yes.

41:30.096 --> 41:33.273
It appears that that
has squared things for me.

41:33.316 --> 41:35.449
So you're gonna take the job?

41:36.581 --> 41:39.105
Gonna hear them out.

41:39.148 --> 41:42.674
I think I owe that much
to them and to myself.

41:42.717 --> 41:45.198
I thought you left
that life behind.

41:45.241 --> 41:47.113
I thought so, too,
but things have changed.

41:47.156 --> 41:49.245
Yeah, but they disavowed
you. Why would you want
to work for them again?

41:49.289 --> 41:50.551
That was on me, Magnum.

41:50.595 --> 41:52.727
I mean, I let my emotions
run away with me

41:52.771 --> 41:55.077
and I went on an
unsanctioned vendetta.

41:55.121 --> 41:56.905
They were right
to cut me loose.

41:56.949 --> 41:59.734
At the very least,
I need to face them

41:59.778 --> 42:00.909
and own up to my actions.

42:00.953 --> 42:03.259
I owe them that.

42:03.303 --> 42:07.176
In some way,
they're my family still.

42:07.220 --> 42:10.615
Well, you have family here, too.

42:14.183 --> 42:16.969
Yes, Magnum,
I am aware of that.

42:17.012 --> 42:19.711
Just gonna leave
all that behind?

42:19.754 --> 42:22.670
Managing a large estate
in Hawaii

42:22.714 --> 42:24.150
was never the plan for me.

42:27.153 --> 42:29.503
Look, I-I'm sorry,
I really have to go.

42:30.852 --> 42:32.550
Have a safe flight.

42:35.553 --> 42:36.554
Wait, Magnum.

42:38.425 --> 42:40.470
I know you won't...

42:40.514 --> 42:44.126
but do try to stay out
of the wine cellar.

42:45.867 --> 42:47.521
I'll do my best.
