WEBVTT

00:03.387 --> 00:04.754
Do you really love Ricky?

00:04.755 --> 00:07.256
The guy who slept
with all those girls?

00:07.257 --> 00:08.725
Or do you
just want to justify

00:08.726 --> 00:10.993
getting pregnant
by him in the first place?

00:10.994 --> 00:12.662
I'm Camille. I'm Leo's assistant.
You're Ricky, right?

00:12.663 --> 00:13.896
How do you know that?

00:13.897 --> 00:15.298
You're like
a second son to him.

00:15.299 --> 00:16.466
I hope you're going
to get

00:16.467 --> 00:17.667
that shower
for Adrian going again.

00:17.668 --> 00:19.268
I don't know if I can do
something that good.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.570
We're going to be friends
for a long time, cookie.

00:20.571 --> 00:22.739
We still really want
to throw the shower for you.

00:22.740 --> 00:24.607
No. no shower.

00:24.608 --> 00:27.043
Why don't you guys apologize
right now to each other?

00:27.044 --> 00:28.878
Adrian really
wanted this shower.

00:28.879 --> 00:30.179
It was embarrassing to me

00:30.180 --> 00:32.415
that you called all those
girls over, Adrian.

00:32.415 --> 00:33.683
And it was embarrassing to me

00:33.684 --> 00:36.052
that you saw them
as competition, Amy.

00:36.053 --> 00:38.221
Don't you ever think
about anything but sex?

00:38.222 --> 00:39.522
Not really, no.

00:39.523 --> 00:40.990
I don't think
I've got the guts

00:40.991 --> 00:42.425
to really try it again
with Madison.

00:42.426 --> 00:43.526
Want to come back with me?

00:43.527 --> 00:44.761
It's not the weekend.

00:44.762 --> 00:46.629
How often do you and I
spend time together

00:46.630 --> 00:47.730
without Amy or Robie?

00:47.731 --> 00:50.099
Thanks for loving me, Ben.
Pleasure.

00:50.100 --> 00:53.002
Hey, Adrian. Congratulations
on your wedding.

00:53.003 --> 00:54.604
And the baby.

00:54.605 --> 00:56.955
Thank you, Grace. Thanks, Amy.

01:00.778 --> 01:03.212
Okay, so you're getting
married this weekend,

01:03.213 --> 01:05.081
and you're having a baby
in a few weeks,

01:05.081 --> 01:06.449
and the plan is?

01:06.450 --> 01:08.651
Oh, I'm doing drugs,
definitely.

01:08.652 --> 01:11.120
I mean, Ben and I are supposed
to go to some classes,

01:11.121 --> 01:13.689
but we've done
all the reading available,

01:13.690 --> 01:15.224
and I'm going
with the epidural.

01:15.225 --> 01:16.993
My doctor knows. Dr. Otavi.

01:16.994 --> 01:20.263
Uh-huh.
I-- I mean the plan, uh,

01:20.264 --> 01:22.999
in regards to finishing out
the rest of the school year.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.003
Oh. Uh, I think
I'll just need a week off,

01:27.004 --> 01:29.038
so I should be
able to catch up

01:29.039 --> 01:31.407
a few days after I'm back.

01:31.408 --> 01:34.510
Oh, my teachers know
that I'm having a baby.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.445
They know that I'll have
to stay out for a few days.

01:36.446 --> 01:38.114
You're probably going
to have to stay out

01:38.115 --> 01:39.649
a little longer than that,
don't you think?

01:39.650 --> 01:41.617
Not if I want to graduate,
no.

01:41.618 --> 01:43.052
I can't stay out
more than that.

01:43.053 --> 01:44.887
Are you putting me on?

01:44.888 --> 01:46.088
About?

01:46.089 --> 01:48.424
Well, you can't
possibly have a baby

01:48.425 --> 01:50.259
and then come back
to school the next week.

01:50.260 --> 01:51.427
Yeah, I can.

01:51.428 --> 01:52.895
We're going to get a nanny

01:52.896 --> 01:55.097
Monday through Friday
7:30 to 3:30.

01:55.098 --> 01:56.432
It'll be fine.

01:56.433 --> 01:57.967
We're going to start interviewing
nannies next week.

01:57.968 --> 02:00.536
And you've discussed this
with your mother,

02:00.537 --> 02:02.371
or anyone else
who's ever had a baby,

02:02.372 --> 02:05.374
coming back to school
the week after having a baby?

02:05.375 --> 02:07.310
Well, my mom's been traveling

02:07.311 --> 02:09.245
so she can help
when the baby gets here,

02:09.246 --> 02:10.812
so just Ben.

02:11.982 --> 02:14.317
And I know.
He hasn't had a baby, but--

02:15.886 --> 02:17.053
What's wrong?

02:17.054 --> 02:18.788
Adrian, you sound as if

02:18.789 --> 02:20.056
you've put
a lot of preparation

02:20.057 --> 02:21.357
into getting ready
for the baby,

02:21.358 --> 02:23.793
but it seems
that you're unaware

02:23.794 --> 02:26.162
that babies require
a lot of help

02:26.163 --> 02:27.563
the first few months.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.798
No, I am aware.

02:28.799 --> 02:30.066
That's why
we're getting a nanny,

02:30.067 --> 02:31.567
and that's why my mom's
taking off from work.

02:31.568 --> 02:34.103
But babies don't sleep
eight hours at night.

02:34.104 --> 02:36.873
You're going
to be up at night

02:36.874 --> 02:39.575
feeding the baby
and changing diapers

02:39.576 --> 02:43.279
and feeding the baby
and changing more diapers.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.381
I think you're going
to have to stay home

02:45.382 --> 02:48.851
at least a month
or maybe even six weeks.

02:48.852 --> 02:51.087
What? No, no.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.188
That's, uh--

02:52.189 --> 02:55.858
That's for, you know,
women your age.

02:55.859 --> 03:00.596
Uh, well, I think it's
for mothers of any age

03:00.597 --> 03:01.797
and dads, too.

03:01.798 --> 03:04.233
Look,
I'm doing this my way.

03:04.234 --> 03:06.068
But look at how
uncomfortable you are.

03:06.069 --> 03:07.703
You should probably
be home now.

03:07.704 --> 03:10.373
I'm not leaving school
until I go into labor.

03:10.374 --> 03:13.542
Adrian, I am going to
make sure you graduate,

03:13.543 --> 03:16.312
but, you know, maybe that's
at the end of summer school

03:16.313 --> 03:17.847
or--
No.

03:17.848 --> 03:20.516
No, no, no.
I'm graduating with my class.

03:20.517 --> 03:22.084
I don't want to go
to summer school.

03:22.085 --> 03:23.319
Summer school's for losers.

03:23.320 --> 03:25.288
Or for people
who are overwhelmed

03:25.289 --> 03:26.822
for whatever reason
during the year

03:26.823 --> 03:27.957
and need extra time

03:27.958 --> 03:29.191
to complete
their requirements.

03:29.192 --> 03:31.894
I can have a baby without
disrupting my education.

03:31.895 --> 03:32.862
That's my goal.

03:32.863 --> 03:35.298
All right. We'll see.

03:35.299 --> 03:40.069
And as your due date
gets closer, you know,

03:40.070 --> 03:42.238
if you are not comfortable
coming in to school,

03:42.239 --> 03:44.073
just come in and talk to me.

03:44.074 --> 03:46.776
And I'm going to need
to talk to Ben

03:46.777 --> 03:48.044
about his plan.

03:48.045 --> 03:50.246
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine
with summer schooling

03:50.247 --> 03:52.114
if I have to stay home
for a while,

03:52.115 --> 03:53.983
but I don't think I want
to do home schooling.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.452
I think I'm going to want
to get out of the house.

03:56.453 --> 03:57.720
I mean,
it's a small apartment,

03:57.721 --> 04:00.122
and there's going to be
a baby inside it,

04:00.123 --> 04:02.925
although we are getting
a nanny to do the hard stuff--

04:02.926 --> 04:05.494
you know, the bathing
and the feeding

04:05.495 --> 04:06.963
and the diaper changing
and all that--

04:06.964 --> 04:08.130
for most of the day.

04:08.131 --> 04:09.432
So we should be okay,

04:09.433 --> 04:11.300
as long as we can
find a good nanny.

04:11.301 --> 04:13.169
But I'm sure we'll
be able to find one.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.438
And I'd like to be home
for as much as possible

04:15.439 --> 04:17.273
and as long as possible
to supervise.

04:17.274 --> 04:18.741
Supervise.

04:18.742 --> 04:20.209
So you can make sure

04:20.209 --> 04:22.043
that the nanny knows
what she's doing?

04:22.045 --> 04:24.780
Yeah. Oh, also, do you
think it would be possible

04:24.781 --> 04:28.718
if I got out of school
on Friday, say, noon?

04:28.719 --> 04:30.519
For the wedding?

04:30.520 --> 04:32.955
Yeah. We're getting
married Friday night.

04:32.956 --> 04:34.423
But we should be
back to school

04:34.424 --> 04:35.658
bright and early
Monday morning.

04:35.659 --> 04:37.526
Can't let a little thing
like a wedding

04:37.527 --> 04:38.928
keep us from school.

04:38.929 --> 04:41.731
No, or a baby.

04:41.732 --> 04:42.665
Yeah.

04:44.901 --> 04:47.436

04:59.881 --> 05:01.549
I'm tired of talking
about it, Amy.

05:01.550 --> 05:03.150
I think we've waited
long enough.

05:03.151 --> 05:04.752
This weekend,
is it all right?

05:04.753 --> 05:07.054
Ricky, we've been
over this before.

05:07.055 --> 05:09.323
I'm not going to be pressured
into sleeping with you.

05:10.625 --> 05:11.759
It's not pressure.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.494
And besides,
it's going to be fine.

05:13.495 --> 05:15.162
Don't make it
so important, okay?

05:15.163 --> 05:16.964
You're making it
way too important.

05:20.702 --> 05:21.669
I just--

05:22.737 --> 05:23.737
I feel funny

05:23.738 --> 05:25.005
about doing it
the first time

05:25.006 --> 05:26.040
the same weekend

05:26.041 --> 05:27.541
that Adrian and Ben
are getting married.

05:27.542 --> 05:29.076
It's odd timing.

05:29.077 --> 05:31.545
I don't want to remember
the first time we did it

05:31.546 --> 05:33.814
as the day that the two
of them said their vows.

05:33.815 --> 05:35.850
Okay, 1, it's not really
the first time,

05:35.851 --> 05:37.718
and 2, I thought
we weren't going to let

05:37.719 --> 05:40.654
what Adrian and Ben do
affect what we do or don't do.

05:44.826 --> 05:46.460
What do you want?

05:46.461 --> 05:48.162
I wanted to let you know

05:48.163 --> 05:50.731
that your first choice
for colleges

05:50.732 --> 05:52.566
wants to interview you.

05:52.567 --> 05:54.235
Why?

05:54.236 --> 05:55.302
Well, they require
an interview

05:55.303 --> 05:56.770
to decide
if they'll let you in,

05:56.771 --> 05:58.239
but they don't
ask for an interview

05:58.240 --> 06:00.508
unless they're considering
letting you in.

06:00.509 --> 06:01.976
This is fantastic news.

06:01.977 --> 06:03.477
You're one step closer.

06:03.478 --> 06:05.513
To something I don't even
know if I want.

06:05.514 --> 06:07.147
Well, I know what you want,

06:07.148 --> 06:09.216
and you might want to try
a little romance.

06:09.217 --> 06:10.584
That would get me
into college?

06:10.585 --> 06:11.519
No.

06:13.154 --> 06:15.022
I-- I know it's
none of my business,

06:15.023 --> 06:18.025
but I don't care if you've had
a baby with Amy or not.

06:18.026 --> 06:20.327
Women like
a little romance.

06:20.328 --> 06:21.495
I've tried
a little romance.

06:21.496 --> 06:22.897
I took her
to the driving range.

06:22.898 --> 06:25.866
You know, to hit balls
at the golf course.

06:25.867 --> 06:27.268
I gave her a golf lesson.

06:27.269 --> 06:30.271
It was at night.
It was romantic.

06:30.272 --> 06:31.906
I'm sure.

06:31.907 --> 06:33.374
Where were we?

06:33.375 --> 06:34.608
I thought we were done here.

06:34.609 --> 06:38.679
I have a list of questions

06:38.680 --> 06:40.915
that you might be asked
in a college interview,

06:40.916 --> 06:44.018
so I will give this to you
so you can prepare.

06:44.019 --> 06:45.853
I haven't even said
I'm going to the interview.

06:45.854 --> 06:46.887
Prepare anyway.

06:48.423 --> 06:51.058
Look, I'm good at what I do.

06:51.059 --> 06:52.593
And I know
what I'm talking about,

06:52.594 --> 06:54.495
and I am trying to help you.

06:54.496 --> 06:57.197
So let's just take a look
at the questions.

06:58.300 --> 06:59.333
All right.

06:59.334 --> 07:01.101
I'm kind of distracted here.

07:01.102 --> 07:02.803
Yeah. I heard.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:12.547 --> 07:14.014
Sure you don't need help
with anything?

07:14.015 --> 07:16.083
I don't need help
with anything.

07:16.084 --> 07:17.585
What are you writing about?

07:17.586 --> 07:19.119
My period.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.788
You're not writing
about that, are you?

07:20.789 --> 07:22.556
I am if it'll keep you
from bugging me.

07:31.967 --> 07:33.667
Think Amy will stay over
at Ricky's this weekend?

07:33.668 --> 07:38.238
I think it's a possibility
and a definite eventuality.

07:38.239 --> 07:39.640
When did you start using
big words like that?

07:39.641 --> 07:40.774
Eventuality.

07:40.775 --> 07:42.242
Did you get that
from your mother?

07:42.243 --> 07:43.510
You and your mother
hang out

07:43.511 --> 07:45.179
using a bunch of big
words last weekend?

07:45.180 --> 07:47.114
Yes, we hung out all weekend
and used big words.

07:47.115 --> 07:48.482
That's what we did.

07:48.483 --> 07:50.618
Anyone else hanging out
using big words with you two?

07:50.619 --> 07:53.654
Are you actually asking me
if Mom's seeing someone?

07:53.655 --> 07:54.922
Yes.

07:54.923 --> 07:56.657
Oh, Dad, don't do this.

07:56.658 --> 07:59.927
Just get out there
and get a life.

07:59.928 --> 08:02.096
I don't know how.
You used to know how.

08:02.097 --> 08:03.530
You used to be an expert.

08:04.866 --> 08:06.967
I can't help you.

08:06.968 --> 08:08.435
What about your study buddy's
half sister

08:08.436 --> 08:09.670
or whatever she is-- Carly?

08:09.671 --> 08:11.405
How about you play
with the kids your own age?

08:13.241 --> 08:14.341
You'll find someone.

08:14.342 --> 08:15.809
She's seeing Josh. Isn't she?

08:17.245 --> 08:19.913
Come on. Ask Amy if she'll
babysit on Friday night.

08:19.914 --> 08:22.383
I really want you to go
to my friend's wedding with me.

08:22.384 --> 08:23.884
I don't really like weddings.

08:23.885 --> 08:26.053
You said you want to go
to Ben and Adrian's wedding.

08:26.054 --> 08:28.589
Yeah, just to see if they
actually go through with it.

08:28.590 --> 08:30.791
This is going to be
just as much fun.

08:30.792 --> 08:32.826
Alex has been married
five times.

08:32.827 --> 08:34.328
Uch. I don't want to go.

08:34.328 --> 08:36.296
Why? Do you think
I might get ideas?

08:36.297 --> 08:38.698
No. I don't think
you'll get ideas.

08:38.700 --> 08:40.100
Do you hope I'll get ideas?

08:40.101 --> 08:42.035
About marriage? No.

08:42.037 --> 08:43.837
I just got divorced.

08:43.837 --> 08:44.838
Not from me.

08:46.474 --> 08:48.542
You know you want to go.

08:48.543 --> 08:50.744
All of our friends from high school
are going to be there.

08:50.745 --> 08:52.379
Karen Corchoran
is going to be there.

08:56.685 --> 08:58.485
I'm sorry about before.

08:58.486 --> 09:01.655
When you're ready, all right?
I'm not pushing you.

09:01.656 --> 09:03.957
After waiting an eternity,
I'm not going to push you.

09:03.958 --> 09:06.393
Thank you.

09:06.394 --> 09:08.462
I really appreciate that.

09:08.463 --> 09:10.197
But I was just wondering--

09:10.198 --> 09:11.498
you're not upset

09:11.499 --> 09:13.534
that Adrian's getting
married to Ben this weekend,

09:13.535 --> 09:14.802
are you?

09:14.803 --> 09:17.905
That's really not what's
bothering you, is it?

09:17.906 --> 09:19.373
That's not
why you're pushing me?

09:19.374 --> 09:21.175
No. It's not bothering me
at all,

09:21.176 --> 09:22.910
especially if it's not
bothering you

09:22.911 --> 09:24.211
that Ben's getting married
to Adrian.

09:24.212 --> 09:25.679
Nope.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.715
And if it does bother you,

09:27.716 --> 09:30.150
I could take your mind
off things, if you let me.

09:31.886 --> 09:33.687
That's really pathetic.

09:33.688 --> 09:36.056
I know. I'm a complete
lunatic at this point.

09:36.057 --> 09:39.159
It's going to happen.
You know it's going to happen.

09:46.668 --> 09:49.002
Hey. I'm going to go
get the photos

09:49.003 --> 09:50.370
from the shower
from my car.

09:50.371 --> 09:51.739
Okay.
Thanks, Amy.

09:54.309 --> 09:55.976
So Jack's dad's staying
in the guest house

09:55.977 --> 09:58.579
tonight with Jack and Tom.
He gets in later tonight.

09:58.580 --> 10:01.115
He said if you and Ben are
going to write your own vows,

10:01.116 --> 10:02.516
he'd love to see them
tomorrow

10:02.517 --> 10:04.585
so he has an idea of what
he's going to be saying.

10:04.586 --> 10:05.652
We thought about doing that,

10:05.653 --> 10:06.920
but we like
the traditional vows,

10:06.921 --> 10:08.956
as long as no one says
anything about obeying anyone.

10:14.696 --> 10:15.696
Hi.

10:15.697 --> 10:16.897
Yeah. Hi.

10:16.898 --> 10:18.766
I was just
on my way to my car.

10:18.767 --> 10:20.634
Forgot to bring in
the photos of the shower.

10:20.635 --> 10:22.536
Grace may want to make
a shower for Adrian,

10:22.537 --> 10:24.438
but I want to show Adrian
the photos first.

10:24.439 --> 10:25.906
That was really nice of you--

10:25.907 --> 10:27.374
of you and Grace

10:27.375 --> 10:30.210
to find all those girls
and do that for Adrian.

10:30.211 --> 10:31.578
It really
made her feel good.

10:32.881 --> 10:34.515
I'm sorry, Ben.

10:35.717 --> 10:37.084
I'm really sorry

10:37.085 --> 10:39.620
for all the things
that I said to you.

10:39.621 --> 10:40.988
I apologize.

10:42.090 --> 10:43.857
I really and truly am sorry

10:43.858 --> 10:45.025
for what I said.

10:45.026 --> 10:47.127
And I am really
and truly sorry

10:47.128 --> 10:48.061
for what I said, too.

10:49.364 --> 10:51.965
So now we've apologized,
and I guess--

10:53.334 --> 10:54.501
life goes on.

10:54.502 --> 10:56.303
Yeah.

10:56.304 --> 10:57.571
I guess it does.

10:57.572 --> 10:58.906
I'm happy.

11:00.608 --> 11:02.009
I'm really happy, Amy.

11:02.010 --> 11:03.110
Great.

11:03.111 --> 11:05.512
Congratulations
on your wedding.

11:06.848 --> 11:09.516
I hope that you and Adrian
continue

11:09.517 --> 11:10.784
to be very happy together.

11:10.785 --> 11:13.787
You and Adrian
and your daughter.

11:18.359 --> 11:20.661
You don't think we will
be happy, do you?

11:22.230 --> 11:24.431
I hope you're happy.

11:24.432 --> 11:26.099
I hope, okay?

11:26.100 --> 11:28.268
But sometimes
doing the right thing

11:28.269 --> 11:30.771
doesn't always make
a person happy, Ben.

11:32.540 --> 11:34.708
I'm 17, Amy.

11:37.745 --> 11:40.814
And I'm about to be
a husband and a father.

11:44.986 --> 11:47.020
I don't want to be
a husband or a father.

11:48.756 --> 11:51.091
Uh, uh, well, now, Ben, Ben--

11:51.092 --> 11:52.559
No. No. No.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.361
I'm fine. I'm fine now.

11:56.164 --> 11:57.831
It was a moment of weakness.

11:57.832 --> 11:59.533
Forget I said anything.

12:23.691 --> 12:24.925
Thank you.

12:24.926 --> 12:28.028
I was just going to sit there
until you came along.

12:28.029 --> 12:30.564
It's like I've been waiting
for you my whole life.

12:43.478 --> 12:45.045
Is something wrong?

12:47.949 --> 12:49.583
How could anything be wrong?

12:51.152 --> 12:53.220
I'm about to be a father
and a husband.

13:12.723 --> 13:14.824
Um, uh...

13:14.825 --> 13:16.593
Betty's about
to come in here

13:16.594 --> 13:17.894
and tell you something,

13:17.895 --> 13:20.029
and I know it's going
to get you upset.

13:20.030 --> 13:21.231
I mean, I'm upset.

13:21.232 --> 13:25.335
But just remember
that Betty is... Betty.

13:25.336 --> 13:27.370
And you're just going
to have to accept that.

13:27.371 --> 13:29.339
We're both going to have
to accept that.

13:30.407 --> 13:31.674
What's going on?

13:31.675 --> 13:33.209
I'll let her tell you.

13:33.210 --> 13:35.411
But, uh, just a reminder.

13:35.412 --> 13:37.780
When you marry someone,
you marry their family.

13:39.250 --> 13:41.117
Oh, there you are, Ben.

13:41.118 --> 13:43.953
Did your dad tell you that
I wanted to speak to you?

13:43.954 --> 13:45.588
Not exactly, no.

13:45.589 --> 13:47.056
I'm afraid
I have to tell you

13:47.057 --> 13:48.524
I can't make it
to your wedding.

13:48.525 --> 13:50.426
I'm really sorry.
What?

13:50.427 --> 13:51.494
Just let her explain.

13:51.495 --> 13:54.063
How can you explain
not being at my wedding?

13:54.064 --> 13:55.265
Is someone dying?

13:55.266 --> 13:56.366
Someone better be dying

13:56.367 --> 13:57.667
if she's not coming
to my wedding.

13:57.668 --> 13:59.435
Ben.
How'd you know?

13:59.436 --> 14:00.603
Someone's actually dying?

14:00.604 --> 14:02.805
My mother.
Oh, Betty, I am--

14:02.806 --> 14:05.174
God, I am sorry.
I'm really sorry.

14:05.175 --> 14:08.511
I haven't seen my mother
since I left home at 16.

14:08.512 --> 14:10.046
You know,
my father passed away

14:10.047 --> 14:11.314
a long time ago.

14:11.315 --> 14:13.016
I really think
that I should be there.

14:13.017 --> 14:14.651
And, you know,
my brothers and sisters,

14:14.652 --> 14:16.085
they want me to be there,
too.

14:16.086 --> 14:17.754
You have brothers and sisters?

14:17.755 --> 14:20.056
Yes. She does.

14:20.057 --> 14:22.959
Uh, they found us after our
picture was in a magazine.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.627
Now a month later,
all of a sudden,

14:24.628 --> 14:25.828
the mother is dying.

14:27.998 --> 14:29.932
I mean, I know it seems,
you know,

14:29.933 --> 14:31.167
kind of a coinkidink,

14:31.168 --> 14:32.669
but I really do think

14:32.670 --> 14:34.604
that they're
telling the truth.

14:34.605 --> 14:35.672
I hope so.

14:35.673 --> 14:36.973
But we don't know so.

14:36.974 --> 14:39.842
Yeah. See, my family,
they're--

14:39.843 --> 14:42.712
they're pretty much
nomads.

14:42.713 --> 14:45.148
I mean they're, you know,
they're not real nomads,

14:45.149 --> 14:46.416
you know,
and they're not thin

14:46.417 --> 14:48.351
like the nomadic people.

14:48.352 --> 14:50.787
They're really
roaming Idahoans,

14:50.788 --> 14:52.455
and they eat
a lot of potatoes.

14:54.325 --> 14:57.093
My mother being
the biggest Idahoan of all.

14:57.094 --> 14:58.561
I don't even think
I should go.

14:58.562 --> 15:01.064
I mean, my mother wasn't
even very nice to me.

15:01.065 --> 15:02.732
But, you know,
I just feel like it's,

15:02.733 --> 15:05.568
you know, she's dying,
and she is my mother.

15:05.569 --> 15:08.304
And I-- Yeah,
I guess you have to go.

15:09.506 --> 15:12.342
Do you want us
to postpone the wedding?

15:12.343 --> 15:14.110
No, you can't do that.

15:14.111 --> 15:15.845
The baby is almost here,

15:15.846 --> 15:19.515
and-- and my mother
is almost there.

15:20.818 --> 15:23.753
But maybe she'll pass
before the wedding

15:23.754 --> 15:25.288
and I can get back right away.

15:25.289 --> 15:26.856
Or maybe she's not
really dying

15:26.857 --> 15:28.858
and your brothers and sisters

15:28.859 --> 15:30.927
are just trying to be
a part of your life

15:30.928 --> 15:32.462
because now your life is good.

15:32.463 --> 15:34.997
Well, that is definitely
a possibility.

15:34.998 --> 15:36.099
But you know what?

15:36.100 --> 15:38.034
I just can't
take the chance.

15:38.035 --> 15:40.536
No, and, you know,
with everything going on

15:40.537 --> 15:43.306
and you and Adrian
and the baby,

15:43.307 --> 15:46.642
I just-- well...

15:46.643 --> 15:48.644
I just really
want to see my mother.

15:48.645 --> 15:52.014
All right, then. I'll see to it
that you see your mother.

15:52.015 --> 15:54.283
I'd feel better about it

15:54.284 --> 15:56.285
if you could wait
until I could go with you.

15:56.286 --> 15:59.889
I don't really like
that you're going all alone.

15:59.890 --> 16:01.190
I'm going to be fine,

16:01.191 --> 16:03.893
and I'm going to get back
as soon as possible.

16:03.894 --> 16:05.128
No, Betty, you know what?

16:05.129 --> 16:07.330
I'm going to send
my driver Mike with you.

16:07.331 --> 16:08.664
No, you can't do that.

16:08.665 --> 16:10.199
No, Mike needs to be here.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.968
No, you may
need him there more.

16:11.969 --> 16:13.736
Mike will take
good care of you.

16:13.737 --> 16:17.240
All right, well,
I guess I got to go pack,

16:17.241 --> 16:19.175
but, uh, but, Ben,
I can't wait

16:19.176 --> 16:20.843
to get back
and see your new baby.

16:20.844 --> 16:24.013
I love you, Betty,
and, uh, safe travels.

16:24.014 --> 16:26.215
Thank you.
I love you, too, Ben.

16:28.018 --> 16:29.419
All right.
I got to go pack.

16:29.420 --> 16:32.588
But no jewelry, right?

16:32.589 --> 16:34.857
No jewelry, no credit cards,

16:34.858 --> 16:38.694
and definitely not
my La Mer cream.

16:38.695 --> 16:39.829
Face cream, you know.

16:39.830 --> 16:41.197
No, I don't know.

16:41.198 --> 16:42.498
I don't want her to go,

16:42.499 --> 16:44.934
but what can I do about it?

16:44.935 --> 16:47.403
Now you see the purpose
of a pre-nup.

16:52.342 --> 16:54.110
So when did we decide
all this?

16:54.111 --> 16:55.478
All what?

16:55.479 --> 16:57.079
Let's star with Jack's dad
marrying the two of them.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.581
Adrian wanted him
to marry them.

16:58.582 --> 17:00.216
A minister
as opposed to a priest?

17:00.217 --> 17:02.385
I don't think
that mattered to her.

17:02.386 --> 17:04.287
Jack's dad is someone
she knows, so--

17:04.288 --> 17:06.422
So now our granddaughter's
going to be Protestant?

17:06.423 --> 17:08.758
I doubt it.
Adrian's not Protestant.

17:08.759 --> 17:10.425
And she's not Catholic,
either.

17:10.426 --> 17:12.929
Well, then, what is she?
What are they, she and Ben?

17:12.930 --> 17:14.597
Two teenagers.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.398
They haven't
figured God out yet.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.767
Just be happy
they're getting married

17:17.768 --> 17:19.101
because that's
what you wanted.

17:19.102 --> 17:20.837
Would they mind if a priest
came over as well?

17:20.838 --> 17:23.973
Yes, you call a priest,
and I'll call a rabbi,

17:23.973 --> 17:26.275
and we'll have a Trifecta
religious people,

17:26.276 --> 17:27.944
or the beginning
of a bad joke.

17:27.944 --> 17:29.846
A minister, a priest,
and a rabbi

17:29.847 --> 17:31.080
walk into a wedding.

17:31.081 --> 17:32.181
That's not funny.

17:32.182 --> 17:34.283
I haven't gotten
to the punch line yet.

17:36.353 --> 17:37.587
So what are you wearing?

17:37.588 --> 17:38.921
A suit, why?

17:41.425 --> 17:43.192
The bride is wearing
a formal gown.

17:43.193 --> 17:44.627
the groom
is wearing a tuxedo.

17:44.628 --> 17:45.895
So I'm wearing
a long dress.

17:45.896 --> 17:47.964
You want me to wear a tux
in my own house?

17:49.066 --> 17:50.199
I don't care.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.667
There's going to be
six people here.

17:51.668 --> 17:53.102
You can wear shorts
if you want to.

17:54.338 --> 17:55.338
Hi.

17:55.339 --> 17:56.639
Just so that you know,

17:56.640 --> 17:58.207
Betty's not coming
to the wedding.

17:58.208 --> 17:59.775
What?

17:59.776 --> 18:01.077
Yeah, her mother's dying,

18:01.078 --> 18:03.246
so she has to go to-- Idaho?

18:04.448 --> 18:06.015
I think that's what
Ben said-- Idaho.

18:07.251 --> 18:08.784
But the wedding's still on?

18:08.785 --> 18:10.186
Yeah. I guess so.

18:10.187 --> 18:11.354
I don't think
we should delay.

18:11.355 --> 18:12.522
There is a time issue here.

18:12.523 --> 18:13.823
You're right. I don't think

18:13.824 --> 18:15.191
they can make my dress
any bigger.

18:15.192 --> 18:17.226
Wait. So Leo's
not going with Betty?

18:17.227 --> 18:19.061
No. Leo's not going
with Betty.

18:19.062 --> 18:21.531
His son is getting married.
He wants to be at the wedding.

18:21.532 --> 18:23.032
All right.

18:23.033 --> 18:25.868
Well, I feel badly
about Betty's mother.

18:25.869 --> 18:27.637
And I feel badly
for Ben and Leo.

18:27.638 --> 18:29.238
I'm sure they wanted
Betty to be here.

18:29.239 --> 18:30.706
It's not that big of a deal.

18:30.707 --> 18:32.174
It's going to be,
like, 20 minutes.

18:32.175 --> 18:35.111
Ben and I want to be back
at the condo and in bed by 9.

18:35.112 --> 18:36.913
Are you feeling okay?

18:36.914 --> 18:39.382
You're not-- You're not
going into labor or anything.

18:39.383 --> 18:41.517
I can get a priest
over here right now.

18:41.518 --> 18:44.687
No, I'm not going into labor.
I feel fine.

18:44.688 --> 18:46.889
Ben and I are getting cable
tomorrow,

18:46.890 --> 18:49.525
and there's a movie we'll want
to see Friday night at 9.

18:50.794 --> 18:51.894
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Smith.</i>

18:53.664 --> 18:56.098
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.

18:56.099 --> 18:57.567
Aren't you being
just a bit casual

18:57.568 --> 18:59.235
about a lifetime commitment?

18:59.236 --> 19:01.337
Me? Ha.

19:01.338 --> 19:02.905
Dad, come on.

19:02.906 --> 19:04.707
This is your, uh,
fourth marriage?

19:04.708 --> 19:05.942
Who's being casual?

19:05.943 --> 19:08.044
Look, I take all of this
really seriously.

19:08.045 --> 19:09.478
I'm just sure about what
I'm doing, okay?

19:11.081 --> 19:12.081
What?

19:19.523 --> 19:22.492
Mm. This is so much fun.

19:22.998 --> 19:24.599
Dinner with my son
in his crib.

19:26.368 --> 19:27.835
We missed you.

19:27.836 --> 19:29.036
We really missed you, Jack.

19:29.037 --> 19:31.172
I hope you go to college
in Arizona.

19:31.173 --> 19:32.540
We love it there.

19:32.541 --> 19:35.176
The dry heat,
and javelinas,

19:35.177 --> 19:37.345
the stupendous sunsets.

19:37.346 --> 19:39.313
I feel closer to God
than I ever have.

19:39.314 --> 19:41.849
You didn't do any of that
desert peyote, did you?

19:41.850 --> 19:44.152
Nope. All on the natch.

19:44.153 --> 19:45.953
The what?
Natch. Natural.

19:47.089 --> 19:48.189
Okay.

19:48.190 --> 19:50.625
I'm just so excited
about this wedding.

19:50.626 --> 19:52.360
Are you and Madison
going to be there?

19:52.361 --> 19:54.195
No. No one's going to be there.
Just the parents.

19:54.196 --> 19:55.196
Oh.

19:55.197 --> 19:56.931
An intimate occasion.

19:56.932 --> 19:58.099
Well, that's fine.

19:58.100 --> 20:00.535
I can scale down the oratory.

20:00.536 --> 20:02.603
Speaking of which,
how is Miss Madison?

20:02.604 --> 20:04.539
Nice segue.

20:04.540 --> 20:05.806
I always like to use humor

20:05.807 --> 20:07.742
when I'm about to discuss
something serious.

20:07.743 --> 20:09.110
Oh, no.

20:09.111 --> 20:10.645
You seem a bit down.

20:10.646 --> 20:11.879
Are you depressed
about something?

20:11.880 --> 20:13.414
Like?

20:13.415 --> 20:15.183
Do you still have
feelings for the bride?

20:15.184 --> 20:17.385
The who?
Adrian.

20:17.386 --> 20:19.187
I never had feelings
for the bride--

20:19.188 --> 20:21.255
not those kind of feelings
anyway.

20:21.256 --> 20:23.391
Is there something
going on with Grace?

20:23.392 --> 20:26.027
Yeah. She's having sex
with her boyfriend.

20:26.028 --> 20:28.429
Oh, that guy I just met--
Grant.

20:28.430 --> 20:30.331
Seems like
a nice enough fella.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.734
I don't want
to have sex with Madison.

20:33.735 --> 20:35.036
That's
what I'm depressed about.

20:35.037 --> 20:38.406
You're just not attracted
to her in that way.

20:38.407 --> 20:40.074
No, I'm attracted to her
in that way.

20:40.075 --> 20:41.842
I just-- I don't know.

20:41.843 --> 20:44.445
If we do it and then
Grace and Grant break up,

20:44.446 --> 20:47.281
and then, if Grace
wants to get back with me,

20:47.282 --> 20:48.616
I'm going to want
to break up with Madison

20:48.617 --> 20:50.484
and try going out
with Grace again.

20:50.485 --> 20:52.386
You didn't do any of that
desert peyote, did you?

20:52.387 --> 20:53.287
No.

20:55.924 --> 20:57.792
Did Grace give you
any indication

20:57.793 --> 20:59.260
that she still
has feelings for you?

20:59.261 --> 21:01.195
No, she's been quite clear
that she doesn't,

21:01.196 --> 21:03.264
but I don't know
if I believe that.

21:03.265 --> 21:05.633
Well, here's what I think
you should do.

21:05.634 --> 21:08.102
Good. Finally, someone that's
willing to tell me what to do.

21:08.103 --> 21:09.103
I'm listening.

21:09.104 --> 21:10.438
Break up with Madison.

21:10.439 --> 21:12.640
I can't do that.

21:12.641 --> 21:15.142
You have to, son.

21:15.143 --> 21:19.213
Asking Madison to unknowingly
accept being in second place

21:19.214 --> 21:20.147
is just not right.

21:21.516 --> 21:23.217
Well,

21:23.218 --> 21:25.586
thanks for the soup.
This is delicious.

21:29.524 --> 21:30.558
Bye.

21:38.367 --> 21:39.467
Bye.

21:42.671 --> 21:43.804
Bye.

21:44.873 --> 21:47.174
Bye already.

21:48.443 --> 21:49.977
Sorry, Tom.

21:49.978 --> 21:51.145
Good night, Kathleen.

21:51.146 --> 21:52.413
Good night.

21:52.414 --> 21:53.347
Good night, Grace.

21:57.052 --> 21:58.052
Bye.

22:00.889 --> 22:02.957
Thanks for letting Grant
eat dinner with us.

22:02.958 --> 22:04.558
Yeah. Any time.

22:04.559 --> 22:05.960
Not any time I'm here.

22:07.362 --> 22:09.697
So, Tom, are you staying
in your old room tonight,

22:09.698 --> 22:11.966
or are you going to stay
out in the guest house

22:11.967 --> 22:12.967
with the guys?

22:12.968 --> 22:14.235
I don't know.

22:14.236 --> 22:17.004
I thought I'd give them
some time together.

22:17.005 --> 22:18.506
That's nice of you.

22:18.507 --> 22:21.242
Who are you texting?
Grant.

22:21.243 --> 22:22.877
I hope he's not driving.

22:22.878 --> 22:24.545
No, he's still
in the driveway.

22:30.185 --> 22:31.952
So how are you feeling

22:31.953 --> 22:33.421
about Adrian and Ben's
wedding?

22:33.422 --> 22:34.989
I'm okay.

22:34.990 --> 22:38.192
It's not my baby.

22:38.193 --> 22:40.261
Ben is a nice guy.

22:40.262 --> 22:44.298
Adrian deserves a nice guy.

22:44.299 --> 22:47.268
And I hope
they are very happy.

22:47.269 --> 22:48.936
Yeah, well,
we got to get out there

22:48.937 --> 22:50.738
and find you a nice girl.

22:50.739 --> 22:52.239
Whatever.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.108
Okay. Good night, honey.

22:54.109 --> 22:55.343
Let me know
if you need anything.

23:03.919 --> 23:06.187
Hello.

23:06.188 --> 23:07.855
I know some attorneys
on the board there.

23:07.856 --> 23:08.956
I could talk to people.

23:08.957 --> 23:10.024
Don't talk to people.

23:10.025 --> 23:12.226
No, no. Talk to people.

23:12.227 --> 23:14.095
My son's going to college.

23:14.096 --> 23:15.963
I'm going to be
the mother of a son

23:15.964 --> 23:17.598
who's going to college.

23:17.599 --> 23:19.700
Maybe you can be
a doctor or a lawyer

23:19.701 --> 23:21.068
or a candlestick maker.

23:21.069 --> 23:22.903
Yeah. I'll go
with candlestick maker.

23:22.904 --> 23:24.205
Calm down, will you?

23:24.206 --> 23:26.273
I haven't even told Amy
that I have this interview.

23:26.274 --> 23:28.576
And an interview does not
mean I'm going to college.

23:28.577 --> 23:29.844
Well, if they're
giving you an interview,

23:29.845 --> 23:31.112
they're probably
going to let you in.

23:31.113 --> 23:32.713
I never should have
even said anything.

23:32.714 --> 23:34.281
Why did I say anything?

23:34.282 --> 23:36.450
Because it's exciting.

23:36.451 --> 23:39.153
I mean, we should open
a bottle of--

23:39.154 --> 23:41.055
milk or something.

23:41.056 --> 23:43.457
Yeah. Milk. Milk is good.

23:43.458 --> 23:44.959
If you do get in,

23:44.960 --> 23:46.694
you're not going to be
able to commute.

23:46.695 --> 23:48.429
It's just a little bit
too far for that.

23:48.430 --> 23:49.430
You know that, right?

23:49.431 --> 23:50.498
I know that.

23:50.499 --> 23:52.533
Maybe I'll get
into some other school,

23:52.534 --> 23:54.001
something closer.
I don't know.

23:54.002 --> 23:56.771
Yeah, maybe you'll have
a bunch of choices.

23:56.772 --> 23:58.172
I mean, you're smart.

23:58.173 --> 23:59.640
I always knew
you were smart.

24:01.143 --> 24:02.710
Hey, are you going to go
get that milk?

24:02.711 --> 24:05.413
Oh, and cookies.
Do you have cookies?

24:05.414 --> 24:07.314
Yes. I'll get you
some milk and cookies.

24:09.117 --> 24:10.217
Wow.

24:10.218 --> 24:12.186
Little Ricky's
going to college.

24:12.187 --> 24:14.722
I am so happy for him.

24:14.723 --> 24:16.690
The only thing
that would be better

24:16.691 --> 24:19.860
is if maybe you
went to college.

24:19.861 --> 24:21.862
With Ricky?

24:21.863 --> 24:23.397
Well,
maybe not with Ricky,

24:23.398 --> 24:25.766
but I think you should
go back to school.

24:25.767 --> 24:28.769
Well, because--

24:28.770 --> 24:31.238
Oh, no. No. Do not go there.

24:31.239 --> 24:33.441
Not for me. For you.

24:33.442 --> 24:35.609
You are really smart, too,

24:35.610 --> 24:37.011
and I know
you've always dreamed

24:37.012 --> 24:38.012
about going back to school.

24:39.414 --> 24:40.381
Mm.

24:48.223 --> 24:50.157
You are okay
with the two of us, right?

24:50.158 --> 24:53.327
You mean do I mind if you're
making out at my house?

24:53.328 --> 24:54.462
I don't mind.

24:54.463 --> 24:56.764
We are in love, you know.

24:56.765 --> 24:59.333
I know. I'm very happy
for both of you.

25:01.837 --> 25:03.571
What about Adrian and Ben?

25:03.572 --> 25:05.105
Are you very happy
for them, too?

25:05.106 --> 25:08.509
Oh. Adrian and Ben are
getting married Friday night.

25:08.510 --> 25:10.344
Wow. Married? In high school?

25:10.345 --> 25:11.979
Yeah. That's what I said.

25:11.980 --> 25:13.481
So how are you feeling
about that?

25:13.482 --> 25:14.748
I don't care.

25:16.751 --> 25:19.320
What?
Uh--

25:19.321 --> 25:21.622
Uh, well, uh...

25:21.623 --> 25:24.325
this seems
like a good time to ask.

25:24.326 --> 25:26.994
How would you feel
about us getting married?

25:26.995 --> 25:30.264
You two are old enough
to get married.

25:30.265 --> 25:31.432
Why?

25:31.433 --> 25:34.935
So it would be okay
with you?

25:34.936 --> 25:36.504
Why wouldn't it
be okay with me?

25:38.673 --> 25:41.375
I don't know. Why wouldn't
it be okay with everyone?

25:42.477 --> 25:43.944
So are you
going to get married?

25:43.945 --> 25:46.480
I think we might.

25:46.481 --> 25:47.648
Yeah.

25:49.050 --> 25:51.018
Oh. Yeah.

25:52.087 --> 25:53.053
Yeah.

25:54.890 --> 25:57.124
It's just that--

25:57.125 --> 25:59.026
I don't know.

25:59.027 --> 26:01.128
Maybe we shouldn't
be getting married.

26:01.129 --> 26:02.429
Maybe you shouldn't.

26:02.430 --> 26:04.231
We don't have to.

26:04.232 --> 26:05.900
I mean, just because
we're having a baby

26:05.901 --> 26:08.502
doesn't mean we have
to get married.

26:08.503 --> 26:10.337
Even if it is
what my dad wants.

26:10.338 --> 26:11.805
I mean,
who cares what he wants?

26:11.806 --> 26:13.374
It's not his life,
right?

26:13.375 --> 26:16.076
And now that Betty has to go
to her mother's deathbed,

26:16.077 --> 26:17.711
it's a good excuse
to get out of it.

26:17.712 --> 26:19.780
I love you, Adrian,

26:19.781 --> 26:22.783
and because I love you,

26:22.784 --> 26:24.785
I have to say this.

26:24.786 --> 26:30.324
I think you should go ahead
with the wedding.

26:30.325 --> 26:31.592
Really

26:31.593 --> 26:34.762
Really. Ben is a nice guy.

26:34.763 --> 26:37.998
And you--
you're a nice girl.

26:37.999 --> 26:40.501
You're going to be fine.

26:40.502 --> 26:42.670
Everything will be fine.

26:42.671 --> 26:44.038
You think so?

26:44.039 --> 26:45.839
I think so, yes.

26:48.243 --> 26:49.677
Thank you, Tom.

26:49.678 --> 26:51.345
I just--

26:51.346 --> 26:52.780
I just needed
to say it aloud.

26:52.781 --> 26:54.248
I just needed to say

26:54.249 --> 26:55.983
that I do have
some doubts about this,

26:55.984 --> 27:00.287
and-- and now that I've
said it, I'm good.

27:02.657 --> 27:04.391
Oh, thanks heavens.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.394
I scared myself,
you know that?

27:07.395 --> 27:09.463
I totally scared myself.

27:11.166 --> 27:14.134
You won't say anything
to anyone, will you?

27:14.135 --> 27:15.903
I'm counting on you.

27:15.904 --> 27:20.708
You can always count on me.

27:20.709 --> 27:25.846
I want to be your friend
the rest of your life.

27:25.847 --> 27:27.047
I promise.

27:42.408 --> 27:43.808
You're late.

27:43.809 --> 27:45.110
I drove myself.

27:45.111 --> 27:46.644
I set Mike with Betty.

27:46.645 --> 27:48.646
Oh, that was nice of you.

27:48.647 --> 27:49.781
I know
you don't mean that.

27:49.782 --> 27:51.649
I don't mean that, no.

27:51.650 --> 27:53.251
What I mean is, poor Mike.

27:53.252 --> 27:55.420
Betty's mother might really
be dying, you know.

27:55.421 --> 27:56.888
She might be.

27:56.889 --> 27:58.389
But there's no listing
of her name

27:58.390 --> 27:59.691
in any hospital
within 200 miles.

28:01.260 --> 28:02.627
But they could have
sent her home

28:02.628 --> 28:04.496
if there was nothing
they could do for her.

28:04.497 --> 28:06.164
What I do know
is that her brother

28:06.165 --> 28:07.432
just filed for bankruptcy
last week.

28:07.433 --> 28:08.967
That I found
on the Information Highway.

28:08.968 --> 28:10.335
It was an easy one.

28:10.336 --> 28:12.704
I have people
who do all of this.

28:12.705 --> 28:14.606
Snooping?
Research.

28:14.607 --> 28:17.175
I know. I just like to help.

28:17.176 --> 28:19.444
Good because I, uh,

28:19.445 --> 28:21.146
I need your help
this weekend.

28:21.147 --> 28:23.448
I need you to go
to the wedding with me.

28:23.449 --> 28:24.449
So it's still on?

28:24.450 --> 28:25.617
Yes, it's still on.

28:25.618 --> 28:26.851
They're definitely
going through with it?

28:26.852 --> 28:28.486
Uh-huh.

28:28.487 --> 28:30.555
Wow. We haven't been
on a date in a long time.

28:30.556 --> 28:32.223
We used to go out
all the time.

28:32.224 --> 28:34.225
This is not a date.
I'm a married man.

28:34.226 --> 28:35.193
And we never went out.

28:35.194 --> 28:36.928
How many dinners
and fundraisers

28:36.929 --> 28:38.563
and events have you dragged
me to over the years?

28:38.564 --> 28:41.299
That was in your
official capacity.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.301
And I didn't drag you.
You wanted to go.

28:43.302 --> 28:46.304
As I recall, you always said
"Maybe I'll meet someone."

28:46.305 --> 28:47.805
And maybe I did.

28:47.806 --> 28:50.909
I just don't want to be
there by myself, all right?

28:50.910 --> 28:51.976
All right.

28:51.977 --> 28:53.444
I mean, with Mike
out of town,

28:53.445 --> 28:54.913
who else are you
going to go with, right?

28:54.914 --> 28:56.681
Right.
Am I driving?

28:56.682 --> 28:58.683
What difference does it make?
It's not a date.

28:58.684 --> 28:59.551
I'm married.

28:59.552 --> 29:00.585
Yeah, you said that.

29:05.758 --> 29:07.091
Hi.

29:07.092 --> 29:09.427
George, right?
Ashley's dad?

29:09.428 --> 29:11.262
May I come in?
Sure.

29:11.263 --> 29:12.597
Ashley's with Malkovich.

29:12.598 --> 29:13.865
I just thought I'd stop by

29:13.866 --> 29:15.767
and see how you think
she's doing.

29:15.768 --> 29:19.237
Ashley is doing really well,
I mean really well.

29:19.238 --> 29:20.371
Yeah. maybe too well.

29:20.372 --> 29:22.040
I think she
and her little study buddy

29:22.041 --> 29:23.208
are all hot for each other.

29:23.209 --> 29:24.576
You know,
Malkovich and I talked

29:24.577 --> 29:25.944
about getting her
a girl study buddy,

29:25.945 --> 29:27.312
but we were
all out of them.

29:27.313 --> 29:29.180
Well, no, I think
you did the right thing.

29:29.181 --> 29:30.448
I think Toby's a nice kid,

29:30.449 --> 29:31.916
and he makes her
want to study.

29:31.917 --> 29:33.218
Yeah, I just hope

29:33.219 --> 29:34.919
he doesn't make her
want to do anything else.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.021
Yeah, I think I should
get them involved

29:37.022 --> 29:38.790
in a group activity.

29:38.791 --> 29:40.058
Only--

29:40.059 --> 29:42.293
Neither of them likes
groups or activity.

29:43.596 --> 29:44.796
Do you like groups?

29:44.797 --> 29:48.099
Or would you rather, say,
be with just one person?

29:49.868 --> 29:50.969
Are you married?

29:50.970 --> 29:53.705
I have a boyfriend.

29:53.706 --> 29:55.139
Serious boyfriend?

29:55.140 --> 29:57.108
We've been together
for years.

29:57.109 --> 29:59.077
But you're not married.
Engaged?

29:59.078 --> 30:00.912
No.

30:00.913 --> 30:02.714
So been together for years

30:02.715 --> 30:04.582
but not married
or even engaged.

30:04.583 --> 30:06.618
I'd say you could be bored.

30:06.619 --> 30:09.220
Want to go out to lunch
and talk about it?

30:09.221 --> 30:10.655
I don't think so.

30:10.656 --> 30:13.024
I appreciate your interest,

30:13.025 --> 30:15.326
but I don't like
to mix my school work

30:15.327 --> 30:16.461
and social life.

30:16.462 --> 30:17.662
Nice talking to you.

30:24.637 --> 30:26.804
Hey. What's going on?

30:26.805 --> 30:28.973
Uh, Dad just hit on--

30:31.443 --> 30:32.510
He did not.

30:32.511 --> 30:33.811
He did.

30:36.148 --> 30:38.549
I think he's going
through a very bad phase.

30:38.550 --> 30:40.084
Oh, no. Really?

30:40.085 --> 30:41.819
Really.

30:41.820 --> 30:44.756
So are we going up to Mom's
tomorrow or not?

30:44.757 --> 30:46.157
I don't know, Ashley.

30:46.158 --> 30:48.092
I kind of want to stick
around here this weekend.

30:48.093 --> 30:49.961
You know, maybe this
would be a good weekend

30:49.962 --> 30:51.629
for you to take Toby
up to Mom's.

30:51.630 --> 30:53.164
You could introduce them.

30:53.165 --> 30:55.199
And, you know, maybe you and
Toby could offer to babysit

30:55.200 --> 30:56.734
and let Mom
go out with Josh.

30:56.735 --> 31:00.638
Leaving Toby and me
essentially alone.

31:01.940 --> 31:03.641
Yeah. I like that.

31:05.944 --> 31:06.878
Uh--

31:10.082 --> 31:11.582
Oh. Hi.

31:11.583 --> 31:15.987
Uh, I'm sorry
about my dad.

31:15.988 --> 31:18.723
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

31:18.724 --> 31:22.460
Isn't it great that your sister's
doing so well with the home schooling?

31:22.461 --> 31:25.163
I-- I'm just so happy
that worked out for her.

31:25.164 --> 31:28.199
Oh, and did Ricky tell you
about his college interview?

31:28.200 --> 31:29.567
No.

31:35.107 --> 31:37.809
Good morning.
Hey, how's it going?

31:37.810 --> 31:40.111
It's going okay. How's it
going with you guys?

31:40.112 --> 31:41.446
Guess who called me.

31:41.447 --> 31:43.281
Jesse.
How'd you know?

31:43.282 --> 31:45.183
Just a guess.
You seemed excited.

31:45.184 --> 31:47.452
Are you going out
with him again?

31:47.453 --> 31:49.120
No. And I'm not excited.

31:49.121 --> 31:50.988
You mistook my anger
for excitement.

31:50.989 --> 31:52.523
He's
going out with someone.

31:52.524 --> 31:53.591
He has a new girlfriend,

31:53.592 --> 31:55.126
and he just wanted
to let me know.

31:55.127 --> 31:56.461
You're going out with someone.

31:56.462 --> 31:58.796
And do I call Jesse
and rub it in his face?

32:00.065 --> 32:01.499
You know what they say--

32:01.500 --> 32:02.834
old boyfriends
always come back.

32:02.835 --> 32:04.736
Sooner or later, they all
circle back around.

32:05.804 --> 32:07.772
That's at least what I heard--

32:07.773 --> 32:10.074
that old boyfriends
come back around.

32:10.075 --> 32:13.478
So Jesse will be back around
at some point.

32:13.479 --> 32:17.281
Sometimes they don't
come back around.

32:17.282 --> 32:18.883
Sometimes they get married.

32:18.884 --> 32:20.785
Right. Okay.

32:20.786 --> 32:23.755
Well, Ben will officially
not be back around.

32:23.756 --> 32:25.923
Yeah. I guess.

32:25.924 --> 32:27.859
But Jesse-- Jesse
might be back around.

32:27.860 --> 32:29.394
He said
he has a girlfriend.

32:29.395 --> 32:31.095
And why do you think
he's coming back?

32:31.096 --> 32:33.564
Well, I think the question
is do you want him back.

32:33.565 --> 32:35.133
I think the question is

32:35.134 --> 32:36.868
if all old boyfriends
come back,

32:36.869 --> 32:37.935
then why aren't you scared

32:37.936 --> 32:39.337
Jack is going to go
back to Grace?

32:41.774 --> 32:43.775
Oh, Jack would never
go back to Grace.

32:44.910 --> 32:46.244
No. Never.

32:46.245 --> 32:48.713
I'm going to go find him.

32:48.714 --> 32:50.314
Have a nice day, though.

32:56.455 --> 32:57.388
Hey.

32:58.557 --> 33:00.124
Uh, when you said

33:00.125 --> 33:02.193
you wanted to talk to me
after your dad leaves,

33:02.194 --> 33:03.728
what did you mean by that?

33:03.729 --> 33:05.596
I meant that I can't have
a private conversation

33:05.597 --> 33:07.498
while he's staying
in the guest house.

33:07.499 --> 33:08.533
Good morning.

33:08.534 --> 33:09.934
Well, is it?

33:09.935 --> 33:12.203
I mean, what did you
want to tell me?

33:12.204 --> 33:14.839
I wanted to say that I--

33:14.840 --> 33:16.107
This isn't the right place.

33:16.108 --> 33:17.675
Tell me.

33:17.676 --> 33:18.943
I've been an idiot.

33:18.944 --> 33:21.279
And I never realized
how much I love you

33:21.280 --> 33:23.981
and how much
I wanted to be with you.

33:23.982 --> 33:26.284
Uh, what made you
realize that?

33:26.285 --> 33:28.119
Your dad?
Yeah.

33:28.120 --> 33:30.955
Well, I guess he likes me
better than Grace.

33:30.956 --> 33:32.123
So do I.

33:37.896 --> 33:39.397
How are you feeling?

33:39.398 --> 33:41.732
I'm getting really excited.

33:41.733 --> 33:43.100
Yeah, me, too.

33:43.101 --> 33:43.968
I've been really calm.

33:43.969 --> 33:45.269
Me, too.

33:45.270 --> 33:47.104
Are we definitely going
to go through with this?

33:47.105 --> 33:49.273
Are you kidding? Would I
leave the girl I love

33:49.274 --> 33:50.441
waiting at the altar?

33:50.442 --> 33:51.442
I hope not.

33:51.443 --> 33:52.577
Is that what you're thinking?

33:52.578 --> 33:54.812
Hey, I could never do that.

33:54.813 --> 33:57.248
I love you.

33:57.249 --> 33:59.517
However, the thought
has crossed my mind

33:59.518 --> 34:00.818
that you might leave me
at the altar.

34:00.819 --> 34:02.954
I could never do that.

34:02.955 --> 34:04.655
I love you, too, Benny

34:12.531 --> 34:14.297
Wishing it was you?

34:14.299 --> 34:15.433
No.

34:15.434 --> 34:16.934
Wishing it was you?

34:16.935 --> 34:18.034
No.

34:18.036 --> 34:19.469
No regrets?

34:19.471 --> 34:20.972
No regrets.

34:20.973 --> 34:22.206
You have any regrets?

34:22.206 --> 34:23.741
Oh, kind of.

34:23.742 --> 34:25.208
I regret
that you didn't tell me

34:25.210 --> 34:26.511
you got into a college.

34:26.512 --> 34:29.112
I didn't get in.
I have an interview

34:29.114 --> 34:31.482
tomorrow, whenever I can
get there after school.

34:31.483 --> 34:33.484
I'm going to ask Bunny
if I can take off from work,

34:33.485 --> 34:34.886
and my mom's
going to work my shift

34:34.887 --> 34:36.587
because Ben will be
getting ready for the wedding.

34:36.588 --> 34:37.755
What school?

34:44.263 --> 34:45.463
Ricky.

34:46.864 --> 34:48.666
This is such
a good thing for you.

34:48.667 --> 34:51.469
I don't know what to say,

34:51.469 --> 34:54.405
other than it's
a few hours from here,

34:54.406 --> 34:56.474
and you'd probably
have to live there and not here.

34:56.475 --> 34:57.808
If I get in.

34:57.809 --> 34:59.710
We'll deal with it then,
okay?

34:59.711 --> 35:01.779
I'm just going to look at it
as a possibility

35:01.780 --> 35:03.614
and hope that there
are other possibilities.

35:05.050 --> 35:07.018
What?
No. Nothing.

35:07.019 --> 35:08.219
Uh, it's just that--

35:08.220 --> 35:09.687
You had pictured
the three of us

35:09.688 --> 35:10.755
living
above the butcher shop

35:10.756 --> 35:12.456
while I worked
and you went to school?

35:12.457 --> 35:14.191
I can adjust that picture.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.194
I'm so happy for you.

35:17.195 --> 35:19.964
This is such a good thing.
It's a very good thing.

35:19.965 --> 35:22.166
I'm so proud of you.

35:22.167 --> 35:24.201
I hope you get in. I do.

35:24.202 --> 35:25.937
I don't know, Amy.

35:25.938 --> 35:27.772
Making a relationship work

35:27.773 --> 35:30.508
when we're this age
and have a son.

35:30.509 --> 35:33.477
It's really not easy.
It's not going to get easier.

35:33.478 --> 35:35.346
What are you saying?

35:35.347 --> 35:36.647
You changed your mind?

35:36.648 --> 35:38.482
You don't even want
to try and make it work?

35:38.483 --> 35:40.151
I'm saying it would
have a better chance

35:40.152 --> 35:41.552
if you and I were having sex.

35:41.553 --> 35:43.821
I'm joking. I'm just joking.

35:43.822 --> 35:45.823
I don't even know
if I want to go to college.

35:45.824 --> 35:48.359
But I do know
I want to see you and John

35:48.360 --> 35:50.328
the second I want to get back
from that interview Friday night.

35:50.329 --> 35:52.496
Better. Much better.

35:53.732 --> 35:54.732
What--

35:54.733 --> 35:56.233
All right.

35:56.234 --> 35:58.135
I'm going to tell you
something,

35:58.136 --> 36:00.071
and I don't want you
to get upset.

36:00.072 --> 36:02.607
You know, maybe
you should tell me later

36:02.608 --> 36:05.476
because I'm kind of
feeling a little upset.

36:05.477 --> 36:06.477
About what?

36:06.478 --> 36:08.546
About I just
have a bad feeling

36:08.547 --> 36:09.847
that you want out
of this relationship.

36:09.848 --> 36:12.350
Adrian texted me last night.

36:12.351 --> 36:14.251
She said she was having
some doubts

36:14.252 --> 36:15.720
and she needed to talk to me.

36:15.721 --> 36:18.322
And?
And I didn't text her back.

36:18.323 --> 36:19.390
I called my mom

36:19.391 --> 36:20.858
and invited her
and her girlfriend over

36:20.859 --> 36:22.360
so I wouldn't be home alone
if she dropped by

36:22.361 --> 36:23.828
because
I don't want to hear it.

36:23.829 --> 36:25.696
I don't want to discuss
her doubts with her

36:25.697 --> 36:27.865
because I don't think
they should be getting married.

36:27.866 --> 36:29.066
I never did.
Yeah.

36:29.067 --> 36:30.668
I--

36:30.669 --> 36:32.603
I had an interesting
conversation

36:32.604 --> 36:34.639
with Ben yesterday.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.107
He said that he didn't
want to get married,

36:36.108 --> 36:38.242
and then he said it was
just a moment of doubt.

36:38.243 --> 36:40.478
You and I could probably
talk them out of it.

36:40.479 --> 36:43.280
But I hope you and I are
not going to talk them out of it.

36:43.281 --> 36:45.016
I don't think that would
be the right thing to do.

36:45.017 --> 36:46.751
No. It wouldn't.

36:46.752 --> 36:48.085
Unless, of course,

36:48.086 --> 36:50.354
you still have
some feelings for Ben.

36:50.355 --> 36:53.758
Or unless you still had
some feelings for Adrian.

37:09.252 --> 37:11.787
Is this right?
Everything in the right place?

37:11.821 --> 37:14.222
You got it.
You look good, son.

37:14.257 --> 37:15.390
Thanks.

37:16.826 --> 37:18.694
I brought you something.

37:18.728 --> 37:20.395
It's a handkerchief.

37:20.430 --> 37:22.130
It belonged to your mother.

37:22.165 --> 37:23.765
It's for the jacket.

37:29.138 --> 37:31.406
I hope it doesn't make me
cry or anything.

37:31.441 --> 37:33.508
You can cry if you want.

37:33.543 --> 37:35.344
I don't want.

37:36.279 --> 37:37.546
I do, but I won't.

37:38.648 --> 37:41.049
So you okay?

37:41.084 --> 37:42.984
Yeah. I'm okay, Dad.

37:44.587 --> 37:48.056
All right. Well, if any time
during the ceremony

37:48.091 --> 37:50.058
you decide you don't
want to go through with it--

37:51.661 --> 37:53.628
just pull out that handkerchief
and wave it at me,

37:53.663 --> 37:54.830
and we'll run.

37:56.232 --> 37:57.733
Go pick up Camille.

37:57.767 --> 37:58.900
I'll see you over there.

37:58.935 --> 38:00.202
I'm glad
she's coming with you.

38:00.236 --> 38:01.737
You're a wreck.

38:03.873 --> 38:07.209
All right. Well,
I guess this is it.

38:13.449 --> 38:15.384
Uh, where's the gift
for Adrian?

38:15.418 --> 38:16.551
You have
the gift for Adrian?

38:16.586 --> 38:17.919
Yeah, I have it.

38:20.323 --> 38:21.356
Don't lose it.

38:21.391 --> 38:22.557
I won't, Dad.

38:22.592 --> 38:24.860
I love you, son.
You know that.

38:24.894 --> 38:26.595
I know that.

38:26.629 --> 38:28.463
I love you, too, Dad.

38:29.665 --> 38:31.633
The important thing
is that you love Adrian.

38:31.667 --> 38:33.869
I love Adrian.
