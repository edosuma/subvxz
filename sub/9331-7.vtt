♪♪

00:06.337 --> 00:07.808
Okay, I'm doing
my free spray tan now.

00:07.808 --> 00:09.880
Uh, no you are not!

00:12.243 --> 00:14.715
I'm locking up
for Martina,

00:14.715 --> 00:16.947
so she said that
I could get the free spray tan.

00:16.947 --> 00:19.019
What? But you're already
a beautiful shade of J-Lo.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.051
You don't need it.

00:20.051 --> 00:21.822
Fine, you can have it.

00:21.822 --> 00:24.295
And then afterwards,
can we go barhopping
and meet some guys?

00:24.295 --> 00:27.258
No, I can't.
You know...

00:27.258 --> 00:28.429
Josh.

00:28.429 --> 00:32.032
Gabi, you and Josh have been
broken up for, like, a month.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.804
Okay? You are allowed to date.

00:33.804 --> 00:35.466
Am I?

00:35.466 --> 00:37.368
I mean, Josh is
in therapy, working on
his commitment issues

00:37.368 --> 00:40.141
and I want to be with him,
so I should wait, right?

00:40.141 --> 00:43.074
Well, why can't you date
while you wait?

00:44.115 --> 00:45.746
I feel like it's one
or the other, you know?

00:45.746 --> 00:47.218
I'm either dating
or I'm waiting,

00:47.218 --> 00:48.579
-and right now, I'm--
-(clunk)

00:48.579 --> 00:49.750
(jingling)

00:49.750 --> 00:51.122
Oh, my God,
someone's breaking in!

00:53.624 --> 00:55.486
(gasps)
He's robbing Martina!

00:55.486 --> 00:56.727
Okay, we gotta call 9-1-1.

00:56.727 --> 00:58.659
-Grab-- grab your phone.
-Okay. Good idea.

01:00.461 --> 01:01.492
Whoa.

01:01.492 --> 01:03.394
Whoa.

01:03.394 --> 01:04.895
(shutter clicks)

01:04.895 --> 01:06.397
I'm not stealing, okay?

01:06.397 --> 01:08.199
I was just taking money
out of the jar...

01:08.199 --> 01:11.272
which sounds a lot like
stealing, but it's not.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.643
Okay, well, I'm calling 9-1-1.

01:12.643 --> 01:14.305
-No, no, no, no, seriously.
-Oh, just save it.

01:14.305 --> 01:17.108
Wait, wait, wait, Sofia.
Let the cute guy talk.

01:18.349 --> 01:20.581
-Hi, what's your name?
-Rob.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.184
What's your last name? "Ber"?

01:23.184 --> 01:24.955
(laughs)
Rob Ber.

01:24.955 --> 01:27.958
-You're funny.
-(laughs) I'm funny too.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.462
Gabi. Explain yourself.

01:31.462 --> 01:33.164
My car is parked next door
in the garage

01:33.164 --> 01:35.065
and I can't get it out
because they only accept cash.

01:35.065 --> 01:37.168
I tried the ATM,
but it's broken.

01:37.168 --> 01:38.569
I saw the light on,
so I came in to see

01:38.569 --> 01:39.900
if I could borrow 20
from Martina.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.133
Oh, Sofia, he knows
Martina. It's fine.

01:42.133 --> 01:45.276
Gabi, what does that say?

01:45.276 --> 01:46.507
Martina's.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.809
Oh.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.981
Look, I was definitely gonna
pay the money back tomorrow.

01:50.981 --> 01:52.283
I love dolphins.

01:52.283 --> 01:53.914
You know they're the only
animals that have sex

01:53.914 --> 01:55.746
for pleasure, well,
besides us?

01:55.746 --> 01:58.749
Oh, my God,
dimples and brains.

01:58.749 --> 02:00.351
Look, I really gotta go.

02:00.351 --> 02:01.452
I'll just find another ATM.

02:01.452 --> 02:02.623
No! No, don't go!

02:02.623 --> 02:05.626
Um, I mean, uh...

02:05.626 --> 02:07.358
Here you go.

02:07.358 --> 02:08.899
What are you doing?

02:08.899 --> 02:10.401
I promise,
I'm gonna pay you back.

02:10.401 --> 02:12.763
-Yeah, like that's
ever gonna happen.
-Over dinner tomorrow night?

02:12.763 --> 02:14.165
Both:
What?

02:14.165 --> 02:16.267
Gabi, let me get your number.

02:17.208 --> 02:20.671
-I thought you said you were--
-Dating. I said dating.

What's so funny?

02:45.236 --> 02:48.098
Is that the video I sent you
of Elliot trying to do yoga?

02:50.401 --> 02:52.603
No, this is better.

02:52.603 --> 02:54.144
His name is Rob.

02:54.144 --> 02:56.447
Oh, I'd get in a bunch
of positions with him!

02:59.480 --> 03:02.453
Yolanda, we met
last night at Martina's

03:02.453 --> 03:04.084
and it was so romantic.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.256
(whispers)
I loaned him money.

03:06.717 --> 03:07.918
(whispers)
Why are we whispering?

03:07.918 --> 03:10.020
Well, Josh is doing
his therapy thing,

03:10.020 --> 03:13.093
and we never talked about
my thing seeing other things,

03:13.093 --> 03:14.995
so I don't want him to know
about my maybe dinner thing

03:14.995 --> 03:16.427
'cause that can
maybe ruin everything.

03:16.427 --> 03:18.128
Oh, I get it!

03:18.128 --> 03:20.231
While Josh is on pause,

03:20.231 --> 03:23.003
you wanna get in
someone else's drawers.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.435
You nasty!

03:24.435 --> 03:26.377
Well, it's not like I want to be
with anybody else.

03:26.377 --> 03:27.908
You know, I wanna be with Josh,

03:27.908 --> 03:30.311
but when he rejected me,
it felt so bad,

03:30.311 --> 03:33.384
and when Rob asked me out,
it felt so good.

03:33.384 --> 03:35.246
And you know, good is
so much better than bad.

03:35.246 --> 03:36.487
Plus, I mean, helloooo.

03:37.818 --> 03:38.949
(phone beeps)

03:38.949 --> 03:40.451
Ooh, hello! It's him.

03:40.451 --> 03:41.522
Who?

03:41.522 --> 03:44.024
It's you.
I'm excited it's you.

03:45.256 --> 03:47.728
Aw, thanks.
I'm excited too.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.600
You know, my therapist
just gave me this new technique

03:49.600 --> 03:51.131
to help me
with my commitment issues.

03:51.131 --> 03:52.803
Intensive journaling.

03:52.803 --> 03:53.904
I just write down
all my thoughts

03:53.904 --> 03:55.266
and feelings right here,

03:55.266 --> 03:57.007
kind of like the journal
that I kept as a kid,

03:57.007 --> 03:58.138
except this time,

03:58.138 --> 04:00.140
my super hot nanny
won't read it and quit.

04:01.672 --> 04:04.545
Gabi, I really think I'm on
the verge of a breakthrough.

04:05.976 --> 04:07.548
A breakthrough? Wow.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.380
Hey, that's-- that's great.

04:09.380 --> 04:12.323
Um, you don't think that's gonna
happen before tonight, do you?

04:12.323 --> 04:14.385
(chuckles)
No, it doesn't work that fast.

04:14.385 --> 04:15.356
(chuckles)

04:15.356 --> 04:17.828
Okay, then you shouldn't
use the word "verge."

04:19.890 --> 04:22.793
So what kinds of things
do you journal about?

04:22.793 --> 04:24.595
Elliot, my journal is private.

04:24.595 --> 04:26.236
Fine. I don't need to know.

04:28.739 --> 04:30.140
(whispers)
I must know.

04:34.805 --> 04:36.176
(rattling)

04:36.176 --> 04:39.380
I cannot believe you are gonna
go out with that robber.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.512
(scoffs)
Rob.

04:43.314 --> 04:46.056
Gabi, the only reason I let you
give him your phone number

04:46.056 --> 04:47.688
is because I thought
he was so sketchy,

04:47.688 --> 04:48.759
he would never call.

04:48.759 --> 04:50.260
But he did!

04:50.260 --> 04:52.363
Yay!

04:52.363 --> 04:53.564
Gabi, I looked him up.

04:53.564 --> 04:54.525
He's not on Facebook.

04:54.525 --> 04:56.166
You know who's not on Facebook?

04:56.166 --> 04:58.699
Criminals, hoodlums,
and my Aunt Becky
who lives in the forest.

05:00.371 --> 05:01.802
Sofie, it's just
one date, okay?

05:01.802 --> 05:03.404
Will you stop freaking out?

05:03.404 --> 05:05.075
And let's look at the facts.

05:05.075 --> 05:08.879
A, he's really hot, and B...

05:08.879 --> 05:10.581
-(knocking)
-He's here.

05:14.114 --> 05:17.217
$20 and nine cents interest.

05:17.217 --> 05:18.419
-I work in finance.
-(gasps)

05:18.419 --> 05:20.391
(whispers)
He has a job!

05:22.052 --> 05:23.924
Oh, yeah? Prove it.

05:26.226 --> 05:28.098
(chuckles)

05:28.098 --> 05:29.129
Oh, boy.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.962
Anyone can make
a gold-embossed business card

05:31.962 --> 05:33.464
with a bank's official logo

05:33.464 --> 05:35.105
with three different ways
of contacting them.

05:35.105 --> 05:36.407
I see it all the time.

05:38.509 --> 05:40.571
Okay. My car's downstairs.

05:40.571 --> 05:42.142
Oh, so is hers.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.675
Gabi, you're driving
because I want you
to be able to get away

05:44.675 --> 05:46.216
if he starts
any funny business.

05:46.216 --> 05:48.078
-Sofia--
-And I want you
to check in with me

05:48.078 --> 05:49.780
every hour on the hour,
and if you don't--

05:49.780 --> 05:51.452
Yeah, do you wanna
just come with us?

05:51.452 --> 05:53.384
I think that would
probably be for the best.

05:54.425 --> 05:55.526
Go!

06:01.562 --> 06:03.333
Okay, Josh, we're gonna go...

06:03.333 --> 06:05.235
unless you need me
to do anything else...

06:06.737 --> 06:08.469
like run a hot bath,
play some Enya,

06:08.469 --> 06:10.601
and read your journal
back to you.

06:10.601 --> 06:13.103
Uh, no thanks, guys.
I'm good. I'll see you tomorrow.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.076
That was just sad.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.181
Am I the only one
who's dying to know

06:21.181 --> 06:22.653
what's in that journal?

06:22.653 --> 06:24.515
Frankly, I don't think
it's any of our business.

06:26.417 --> 06:28.489
You saw it!

06:29.960 --> 06:31.391
Maybe I did.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.123
Maybe I was dusting his office.

06:33.123 --> 06:35.395
Maybe I looked
over his shoulder.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.498
And maybe you should start
looking for another job.

06:38.799 --> 06:39.900
What?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.972
I can't say anymore.

06:41.972 --> 06:44.535
But I did read the words

06:44.535 --> 06:47.978
"need to make a change,"
"dead weight,"

06:47.978 --> 06:49.780
and, "Do I really
need a publicist?"

06:50.881 --> 06:52.112
-(ding)
-Oh!

06:52.112 --> 06:55.145
But I do remember
one good thing.

06:55.145 --> 06:56.747
Yeah?

06:56.747 --> 07:00.150
He said I was the mother
he always dreamed of having.

07:00.150 --> 07:01.652
-(ding)
-(laughs)

07:08.629 --> 07:11.632
Rob, tonight has been
really fun.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.665
I am so glad that dolphin
broke his flipper.

07:14.665 --> 07:16.266
You make it sound like
the night's over.

07:16.266 --> 07:19.309
Oh. Well, I didn't mean to.
It was an accident.

07:19.309 --> 07:21.542
I'm gonna run
into the liquor store
and grab us a bottle of wine.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.943
Okay.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.820
(phone rings)

07:30.981 --> 07:32.422
Hello?

07:32.422 --> 07:34.525
Sofia, it's my
ten o'clock check-in.

07:34.525 --> 07:37.257
Gabi, if he's holding you
against your will, say "banana."

07:38.859 --> 07:40.390
Will you give it a rest?

07:40.390 --> 07:41.862
We've been talking nonstop.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.634
I told him all about
my job being a chef

07:43.634 --> 07:45.736
and he told me all about
his job doing...

07:45.736 --> 07:48.799
something that requires
something boring.

07:48.799 --> 07:51.001
Trust me,
he's a really great guy.

07:51.001 --> 07:52.472
You were so wrong about him

07:52.472 --> 07:54.545
and you have
nothing to worry about.

07:54.545 --> 07:57.447
Oh, he's coming.
Okay, I gotta go. Bye.

07:58.849 --> 08:01.151
-Hey.
-Drive, drive, drive!

08:06.817 --> 08:08.418
Oh, my God!

08:08.418 --> 08:10.621
Banana, banana, banana!

08:12.462 --> 08:14.364
I told you he was bad!

08:14.364 --> 08:16.266
What happened?

08:16.266 --> 08:18.529
Um, we may have
just a little bit...

08:18.529 --> 08:20.200
robbed a liquor store.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.802
What?!

08:21.802 --> 08:25.105
Quick! I need lighter fluid,
nail polish remover,

08:25.105 --> 08:26.677
and more hairspray!

08:26.677 --> 08:28.338
I have to destroy the evidence!

08:29.710 --> 08:30.841
Gabi, just--

08:30.841 --> 08:32.713
Okay, just tell me
exactly what happened!

08:32.713 --> 08:34.384
No! I can't!

08:34.384 --> 08:37.247
Or you won't have that thing
where you don't know anything!

08:37.247 --> 08:38.749
Huh?

08:40.050 --> 08:42.593
(pants)
You know, the thing

08:42.593 --> 08:43.854
where you can't
testify against me

08:43.854 --> 08:45.626
because you don't have
any information.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.928
You mean for robbing
a liquor store?
You already told me.

08:47.928 --> 08:50.260
Damn it!

08:50.260 --> 08:52.432
Okay, just take
a deep breath please

08:52.432 --> 08:54.234
and-- and then tell me
exactly what happened.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.866
Okay, so right after
I talked to you

08:55.866 --> 08:57.467
and everything was going great,

08:57.467 --> 08:58.609
everything went bad.

08:58.609 --> 09:00.741
Rob jumped in the car
with his hood up,

09:00.741 --> 09:02.973
all out of breath and yelled,
"Drive, drive, drive!"

09:02.973 --> 09:05.315
So, I asked him, you know,
"Rob, what's wrong?"

09:05.315 --> 09:06.817
But he screamed,
"Just drive!"

09:06.817 --> 09:08.819
So, I just drove
and after a few blocks,

09:08.819 --> 09:10.520
he remembered
he "had a thing,"

09:10.520 --> 09:11.922
so I dropped him off
at some corner

09:11.922 --> 09:13.483
and he ran into the night!

09:13.483 --> 09:14.855
Oh, my God!

09:14.855 --> 09:15.886
We gotta call the police!

09:15.886 --> 09:16.687
No, no, no, no!

09:16.687 --> 09:18.528
Sofia, I drove the getaway car.

09:18.528 --> 09:20.260
I'm an accessory!

09:20.260 --> 09:23.033
Oh, my God, what if
he comes back to kill me
because I'm a witness?!

09:23.033 --> 09:25.535
Gabi, believe me, that guy is
so far out of town right now.

09:25.535 --> 09:27.367
-(knocking)
-Gabi, it's Rob!

09:27.367 --> 09:29.039
Oh, my God, he's in town.
He's in town!

09:29.039 --> 09:30.601
Okay, calm down, calm down.

09:30.601 --> 09:31.742
What do you think
he's gonna do?

09:31.742 --> 09:33.403
Murder you for being a witness
and then murder me

09:33.403 --> 09:34.945
for witnessing him
murder a witness?

09:34.945 --> 09:36.146
Oh, no...

09:36.146 --> 09:39.650
I'm not wearing the underwear
that I want to die in!

09:39.650 --> 09:41.281
Okay, let's just
get out of here!

09:41.281 --> 09:42.452
-Let's escape!
-Okay.

09:42.452 --> 09:43.483
Fire escape, fire escape!

09:46.116 --> 09:47.788
(both panting)

09:50.060 --> 09:51.762
What now? What now? What now?

09:51.762 --> 09:53.724
-Let's go to Yolanda's.
-Okay.

09:53.724 --> 09:56.596
No! No! She's not home!

09:56.596 --> 09:58.629
-What's today?
-Uh, T-- Tuesday.

09:58.629 --> 10:01.471
Damn it! It's Afro Soul Night
at The Zoom Room!

10:02.803 --> 10:04.805
-What now? What now?
-Call her!

10:04.805 --> 10:07.778
No, I can't! My phone is
in my evidence purse.

10:07.778 --> 10:09.609
-You call her.
-No, I-- I can't.
My phone's dead!

10:09.609 --> 10:11.111
Like we're gonna be
if we go back in there!

10:11.111 --> 10:13.684
Oh, this is what I get
for dating and not waiting!

10:13.684 --> 10:15.015
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.549
-(knocking)
-Rob: Gabi!

10:19.549 --> 10:20.721
-Run!
-Run!

10:31.501 --> 10:33.904
Elliot's voice:
If I was a tablet containing

10:33.904 --> 10:36.967
Josh's deepest thoughts
about me,

10:36.967 --> 10:38.809
where would I be?

10:41.842 --> 10:43.173
Darn!

10:44.274 --> 10:47.447
If I was a macaroon
in Josh's cookie jar,

10:47.447 --> 10:49.449
what flavor would I be?

10:51.682 --> 10:52.923
Raspberry.

11:10.841 --> 11:11.742
Ow.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.348
(snorts, groans)

11:29.589 --> 11:31.491
I can't believe it.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.894
I layeth next
to my forbidden love

11:33.894 --> 11:36.496
and our hearts doth
beat as one.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.368
Stop, Elliot!

11:38.368 --> 11:39.870
Thou must focus.

11:46.737 --> 11:48.178
Sleep well, my little prince.

11:55.846 --> 11:56.947
Ow.

12:04.925 --> 12:07.397
Oh, my God,
you're a genius.

12:07.397 --> 12:09.629
I can never remember
her lockbox code.

12:09.629 --> 12:11.031
Gabi, it's four zeros.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.033
(sighs)
Okay, good call
coming into Martina's.

12:13.033 --> 12:15.035
Nothing bad ever happens
to me here.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.406
Except for that one time
I got bangs.

12:16.406 --> 12:18.869
Gabi, Rob could be following us.

12:18.869 --> 12:20.070
We need to call the police.

12:20.070 --> 12:21.912
No, no, no, no,
there has to be another option.

12:21.912 --> 12:23.573
What about Josh?

12:23.573 --> 12:25.075
(whines)

12:25.075 --> 12:26.646
No!

12:26.646 --> 12:28.849
No. Whining until I give in is
just not gonna work this time.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.921
(whines)

12:30.921 --> 12:33.153
-I'm calling him.
-No!

12:33.153 --> 12:34.925
Sofia, we can't call Josh, okay?

12:34.925 --> 12:37.928
Because even though
it's probably not
gonna work out with Rob...

12:37.928 --> 12:39.729
Oh, "probably"?

12:39.729 --> 12:41.631
I just don't think
he needs to know.

12:41.631 --> 12:43.663
We need a rich guy
with lawyers.

12:43.663 --> 12:45.735
Do you know one of those
who isn't Josh?

12:47.037 --> 12:48.738
No.

12:48.738 --> 12:49.900
Fine. I'll call.

12:53.904 --> 12:54.945
Boop, boop, boop.

12:54.945 --> 12:56.977
Boop, boop, boop,
boop, boop, boop.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.748
I see you booping.

13:01.211 --> 13:02.853
(phone rings)

13:05.255 --> 13:08.018
-Gabi: Josh! Josh!
-Gabi?

13:08.889 --> 13:10.290
Wait, where are you?

13:11.791 --> 13:12.893
Okay, I'm on my way!

13:16.066 --> 13:19.099
"I can't stop thinking
about Gabi.

13:19.099 --> 13:22.232
Why can't I commit
to this amazing woman?"

13:23.803 --> 13:25.976
This is what I left
Josh's bed for?

13:27.307 --> 13:29.479
Find "Elliot."

13:30.981 --> 13:32.782
Zero results?!

13:32.782 --> 13:34.284
Yolanda set me up!

13:34.284 --> 13:35.745
That bitch!

13:37.687 --> 13:39.019
(footsteps)

13:44.024 --> 13:45.755
(beeping)

13:45.755 --> 13:47.928
Female electronic voice:
Motion detectors on

13:47.928 --> 13:54.004
in five, four, three, two, one.

13:54.004 --> 13:56.436
-(beep)
-Motion detectors on.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.578
-Aah! Help!
-(clattering)

14:10.820 --> 14:13.823
Are you guys okay?
Gabi, what's going on?

14:13.823 --> 14:15.555
Josh, this is really hard
for me to say,

14:15.555 --> 14:17.587
but the truth is that, uh...

14:18.788 --> 14:19.859
Sofia may have accidentally

14:19.859 --> 14:21.091
been involved in
a liquor store robbery.

14:22.662 --> 14:23.994
What?

14:23.994 --> 14:26.066
Well, to be fair,
she didn't know

14:26.066 --> 14:28.738
he was a criminal
until she was driving
the getaway car.

14:28.738 --> 14:30.640
But for the record,
I thought he was sketchy.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.244
Oh, wow.
Sofia, I'm really surprised.

14:34.244 --> 14:36.206
I don't know
what I was thinking.

14:36.206 --> 14:37.978
Gabi, what was I thinking?

14:37.978 --> 14:39.349
She wasn't.

14:39.349 --> 14:41.651
She was hypnotized
by the allure of his dimples.

14:43.113 --> 14:45.115
Anyway, uh, when he showed up
at our place looking for her,

14:45.115 --> 14:46.886
we ran to the fire escape
and we called you.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.288
(phone rings)

14:49.759 --> 14:51.091
That's weird.
It's my alarm company.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.422
Hello?

14:52.422 --> 14:55.125
Yes, this is Josh Kaminski.

14:55.125 --> 14:56.766
Oh, my God.

14:56.766 --> 14:58.028
Rob is robbing Josh.

14:58.028 --> 14:59.269
Why would he do that?

14:59.269 --> 15:01.201
Because he's a robber.
This is what he does!

15:01.201 --> 15:03.573
Okay. Let me make a phone call.

15:03.573 --> 15:04.904
I'm sure we don't need
the police.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.276
No! We need the police!
We need the police!

15:06.276 --> 15:07.777
We need the police!
We need the police!

15:10.180 --> 15:12.112
Why do we need the police?

15:12.112 --> 15:14.614
Sofia told her date that
I work for Josh Kaminski,

15:14.614 --> 15:16.286
who's a really rich
tech millionaire

15:16.286 --> 15:17.687
and he has lots of nice stuff.

15:17.687 --> 15:19.449
Sofia, why would
you tell him that?

15:20.951 --> 15:23.523
Because she really wanted
to impress him--

15:23.523 --> 15:25.825
she-- him-- she-- So--

15:25.825 --> 15:27.427
Me, okay?! It was me!

15:27.427 --> 15:29.399
I was the one
who went on the date.

15:29.399 --> 15:31.061
I'm the one who drove
the getaway car.

15:31.061 --> 15:32.902
I'm the one who told him
you live in the fanciest

15:32.902 --> 15:34.104
building in Nob Hill
with a night doorman

15:34.104 --> 15:36.066
who's always
playing Candy Crush,

15:36.066 --> 15:38.738
and he's obviously over there
right now robbing you blind!

15:40.070 --> 15:41.741
-Oh, my God.
-I know.

15:41.741 --> 15:44.114
I am so sorry.
This is all my fault.

15:44.114 --> 15:45.945
You're dating?!

15:51.321 --> 15:52.382
(ding)

16:00.690 --> 16:02.932
Okay, stay behind me.

16:02.932 --> 16:04.234
-Mr. Kamin--
-(screams)

16:07.637 --> 16:08.798
Yes? I'm Josh Kaminski.

16:08.798 --> 16:10.500
How can I help you?
Is everything okay?

16:10.500 --> 16:11.841
Now it is.

16:11.841 --> 16:14.204
-But you were being robbed.
-Both: Oh, my God!

16:14.204 --> 16:16.876
We got the guy.
He's not going quietly.

16:18.248 --> 16:20.110
(sobs)

16:22.182 --> 16:25.115
I'm too pretty
to go to prison!

16:25.115 --> 16:26.116
Elliot?

16:26.116 --> 16:29.319
Found this man
frozen on all fours
in your living room.

16:31.321 --> 16:33.263
I'm just thankful
he wasn't naked.

16:35.165 --> 16:37.467
I could tell you some stories.

16:37.467 --> 16:39.099
Okay, this is my publicist.
He works here.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.171
-This is a misunderstanding.
-Yeah!

16:41.171 --> 16:42.672
The only crime committed here

16:42.672 --> 16:44.274
was that he didn't write
about me in his journal!

16:46.676 --> 16:48.178
How do you know that?

16:48.178 --> 16:49.739
Elliot!

16:49.739 --> 16:52.242
I told you
my journal was private!

16:53.343 --> 16:55.585
Obviously this is
just a lovers' quarrel.

16:55.585 --> 16:57.187
No need to write this up.

16:57.187 --> 17:00.090
Yes, no need to write
anything about me.

17:00.090 --> 17:01.451
No one else does.

17:04.054 --> 17:06.396
Well, uh, looks like
we're done here.

17:06.396 --> 17:08.198
No, no, no, no, Officer.

17:08.198 --> 17:09.959
There was a crime
committed tonight,

17:09.959 --> 17:12.462
down at the liquor store
on the corner of Olive
and Birch.

17:12.462 --> 17:14.064
I know 'cause I was there,

17:14.064 --> 17:17.107
and now the very handsome robber
is after me and my roommate.

17:18.608 --> 17:20.940
Oh, no crime was
committed there.

17:20.940 --> 17:23.173
I was just there buying
some feminine products.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.476
For my daughter.

17:26.476 --> 17:29.349
I'm a single dad.
She's 11.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.251
Is that too early
for her to start her womanhood?

17:31.251 --> 17:33.653
(whistles)
Not nowadays.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.525
Girls are getting
their periods at nine.

17:35.525 --> 17:37.287
It's the hormones
in the milk.

17:37.287 --> 17:38.558
Hey!

17:38.558 --> 17:40.460
We are in danger here.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.532
We need a police escort
back to our house.

17:42.532 --> 17:44.234
Okay. I can take you back,

17:44.234 --> 17:45.835
but I need to ask you
a few questions.

17:45.835 --> 17:49.099
Officer, we will give you
all the information you need.

17:49.099 --> 17:52.242
On those feminine pads,
what are the wings for?

17:59.279 --> 18:01.151
Police! Coming in!

18:03.353 --> 18:05.315
(phone chimes)

18:05.315 --> 18:07.056
Oh, it's my voice mail.

18:07.056 --> 18:08.588
Oh, my God! It's him!

18:08.588 --> 18:10.360
Wait, Officer Morrison!

18:10.360 --> 18:12.362
This is the guy.
He left me a voice mail.

18:12.362 --> 18:14.093
Maybe he'll say something
to prove he's a thief.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.266
Hey, Gabi.
It's me, Rob.

18:16.266 --> 18:18.268
You didn't answer your door,
so I'm calling to explain

18:18.268 --> 18:19.229
what happened
at the liquor store.

18:19.229 --> 18:20.330
Here we go.

18:20.330 --> 18:22.402
Gabi, I'm a bad, bad guy.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.634
This is it,
this is it.

18:24.634 --> 18:25.805
I have a girlfriend,

18:25.805 --> 18:27.807
and when I went
into the liquor store,

18:27.807 --> 18:29.679
she was there,
so I panicked and ran.

18:31.641 --> 18:33.213
I kind of live with her,

18:33.213 --> 18:34.544
so if you still
want to hang out,

18:34.544 --> 18:35.985
call me at work.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.419
Yes! He has a girlfriend.

18:41.691 --> 18:45.395
I mean-- Yes,
no crime was committed.

18:45.395 --> 18:48.228
We can all sleep,
uh, a little better tonight.

18:49.559 --> 18:50.960
I won't.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.663
My daughter just texted me
to bring home some rocky road,

18:53.663 --> 18:55.765
The Notebook , and Midol.

18:57.407 --> 18:59.169
It's gonna be a long night.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.174
Okay, I'm just gonna get going.

19:04.174 --> 19:05.315
Wait. Josh?

19:06.576 --> 19:08.248
-We need to talk.
-(chuckles)

19:08.248 --> 19:09.479
Boy, do we ever.

19:09.479 --> 19:11.251
I mean, I didn't want
to scare Officer Morrison,

19:11.251 --> 19:13.283
but I didn't get my period
until I was-- Good night.

19:17.387 --> 19:18.658
I just want to say,

19:18.658 --> 19:21.831
I'm really sorry
for dating behind your back

19:21.831 --> 19:23.933
even though it wasn't really
behind your back

19:23.933 --> 19:25.295
because we're not together.

19:27.036 --> 19:28.638
Gabi, you don't
have to apologize.

19:28.638 --> 19:30.340
Then why do I feel like
I need to apologize?

19:30.340 --> 19:32.502
Because you should.

19:32.502 --> 19:33.873
What?

19:33.873 --> 19:36.075
Listen, Josh, if you want me
to wait until you solve

19:36.075 --> 19:37.877
your issues, just say that
and that's what I'll do.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.049
-I want you to wait.
-But that's not fair!

19:42.482 --> 19:44.754
Look, if you want to date...

19:46.015 --> 19:47.517
-then you should...
-Okay.

19:47.517 --> 19:48.958
-n't.
-What?!

19:48.958 --> 19:51.461
You shouldn't...

19:51.461 --> 19:53.263
but you can...

19:53.263 --> 19:54.324
n't.

19:54.324 --> 19:57.327
Josh, do you want me
to date or not?

19:57.327 --> 19:59.369
No.

19:59.369 --> 20:01.501
But I can't ask you to wait.

20:01.501 --> 20:02.602
That's not right.

20:04.173 --> 20:05.775
So, I'm dating?

20:07.707 --> 20:09.279
I guess...

20:09.279 --> 20:11.040
you're dating.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.582
And you're okay with that?

20:15.114 --> 20:16.916
I guess...

20:16.916 --> 20:18.618
I'm okay with that.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.592
As long as every date ends
with you calling me up

20:22.592 --> 20:24.924
in the middle of the night
telling me what a disaster
it was.

20:25.955 --> 20:26.956
Deal.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.359
Good night, Gabi.

20:29.359 --> 20:30.930
Good night, Josh.

20:36.466 --> 20:38.338
(vocalizing)

20:38.338 --> 20:39.509
Whoo! Boom!

20:41.240 --> 20:42.372
Oh, my damn.

20:42.372 --> 20:45.445
Am I at your penthouse?

20:45.445 --> 20:47.417
I'm drunker than I thought!

20:49.178 --> 20:50.780
You mind if I come in?

20:54.384 --> 20:56.155
Josh, I know
what I did was wrong,

20:56.155 --> 20:57.887
but I just have to say
it really hurts

20:57.887 --> 21:00.430
that you didn't mention me
at all in your journal.

21:00.430 --> 21:01.861
Would you like to know why?

21:01.861 --> 21:03.533
It doesn't even matter! I--

21:03.533 --> 21:05.034
Yes.

21:06.436 --> 21:08.568
Because you're
my best friend, Elliot.

21:08.568 --> 21:09.969
When I have feelings
I want to express,

21:09.969 --> 21:11.971
I just talk to you freely.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.243
We have a completely open
and honest relationship.

21:14.243 --> 21:16.105
-We do?
-We did.

21:16.105 --> 21:18.678
Until you violated my privacy
and you shattered my trust.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.550
I'm really sorry, Josh.
