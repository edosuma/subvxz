01:24.931 --> 01:28.162
- Nothing Thun Dera, huh?
- Guaranteed not, Snarf.

01:28.335 --> 01:30.667
Damn it.

01:31.638 --> 01:33.697
Bloody scrap.

01:33.874 --> 01:37.435
Stabilization
spirals are completely destroyed.

01:37.611 --> 01:40.739
It seems so.
How does it look otherwise?

01:40.914 --> 01:43.610
Not bad.

01:44.117 --> 01:49.800
I can scrape together enough
metal to build a Thunderbird Tank.

01:49.990 --> 01:54.100
- We can always count on you, Panthro.
- No problem.

01:54.227 --> 01:57.999
First thing in the
emergency is to remain calm.

01:59.366 --> 02:01.926
We have a great matfronten.

02:02.102 --> 02:06.129
No food went to pieces during the crash.

02:07.374 --> 02:10.810
I have been wondering when someone
would say: "lunch".

02:10.977 --> 02:14.413
Wilykat, Kit,
stop playing with the food.

02:14.581 --> 02:18.448
We eat after we
loading of heavy cargo

02:18.718 --> 02:22.888
Heavy load on an empty stomach?
Wonderful.

02:28.295 --> 02:30.820
Sad little planet, right?

02:31.498 --> 02:37.630
Very. Not that ye
or forests at Plun-Darr.

02:37.804 --> 02:42.707
This is not a tour. Look forward.

02:45.579 --> 02:47.843
Help me with this, Lion-O.

02:48.014 --> 02:51.973
It might be better if I'm watching
field while doing that.

02:52.152 --> 02:55.246
It is my responsibility to ensure
that we have it safe.

02:55.422 --> 02:59.324
- We need all the help we can get.
- No, Lion-O is right.

02:59.493 --> 03:01.893
We ought to reconnoitre the area -

03:02.062 --> 03:06.863
and as lord of the Thundercats,
His safety is our responsibility.

03:07.033 --> 03:09.033
Right. I go with you.

03:09.135 --> 03:12.866
I do not need a nanny anymore.
Try to understand it, Snarf.

03:13.039 --> 03:17.999
Come, Snarf, you are still required.
We need you to help here.

03:18.578 --> 03:22.878
Sure. No one knows I exist
except when there'sa job.

03:23.350 --> 03:28.800
Take kloskÃ¶lden sword and Omens, Lion-O.
You may need to call on us.

03:28.955 --> 03:36.700
- I think I can handle it all.
- Was it a good idea, tygr?

03:36.963 --> 03:41.161
Should we not make it easy for Lion-O
To avoid bad things?

03:41.334 --> 03:47.136
Remember, Lord Lion-O
spent 10 years in the galaxy-a capsule.

03:47.307 --> 03:51.300
During that time he grew,
but he was not an adult.

03:51.711 --> 03:56.478
He missed life experiences
as you need.

04:00.420 --> 04:04.481
Rivers are the
large bodies of water.

04:04.658 --> 04:06.785
No sign of settlement.

04:06.960 --> 04:11.700
- They can live in caves.
- No. Watch.

04:11.831 --> 04:15.528
- Some form of architecture.
- In ruins.

04:15.702 --> 04:22.072
There was someone civilization
on this ridiculous planet.

04:22.242 --> 04:24.267
We do not have time to brood on it now.

04:24.444 --> 04:29.939
I feel Thundercats,
they will build a fort quickly.

04:30.116 --> 04:33.108
We must also establish a foundation.

04:33.286 --> 04:39.384
So look for a place where
we can build: "The castle Plun-Darr".

04:39.559 --> 04:44.963
Over there. A desert, and something else.

04:51.871 --> 04:53.871
What is that?

04:53.974 --> 04:59.412
Not primitive life form created it.
It is safe.

04:59.579 --> 05:03.174
I do not like how it looks.

05:03.516 --> 05:07.555
We go so far away
away from it as we can.

05:21.835 --> 05:25.327
- What happens?
- The controls do not respond.

05:25.505 --> 05:27.777
We crashes.

05:39.786 --> 05:44.999
- I see no foe.
- What got us to crash?

05:48.862 --> 05:52.855
- Where are the cause.
- Yes.

05:53.299 --> 05:59.499
No one thing works against Slither.
Come on, yes?

06:00.006 --> 06:04.500
- Is it a good idea?
- Are you afraid, Jackalman?

06:04.611 --> 06:06.875
And you call yourself a mutant?

06:07.047 --> 06:11.780
We are horror-creators,
not those who are afraid.

06:12.719 --> 06:17.986
You are right, Slither.
Lead us.

06:19.626 --> 06:21.666
Watch.

06:24.531 --> 06:26.795
<i> Antra. </ i></i>

06:27.233 --> 06:29.565
Arm yourselves.

06:29.736 --> 06:33.194
<i> Your arms are not necessary. </ i></i>

06:33.373 --> 06:36.035
<i> You are welcome here. </ i></i>

06:41.081 --> 06:44.517
<i> Follow the ball of light. </ i></i>

06:59.432 --> 07:02.492
- Where are you?
- Who are you?

07:02.669 --> 07:07.936
<i> There you shall soon find out.
Fear not. </ I></i>

07:08.108 --> 07:13.341
I Slither and
I fear nothing.

07:17.784 --> 07:21.999
It is actually quite
comfortable here.

07:34.300 --> 07:39.135
- What is this House?
- Look, those statues.

07:39.706 --> 07:43.164
What do you think,
an ancient race of mutants?

07:43.343 --> 07:47.040
No wonder why
I like this place.

07:47.547 --> 07:53.577
- What is that?
- It looks like a coffin.

07:54.154 --> 08:01.400
But was he who asked us to board?
I do not see any live.

08:04.531 --> 08:08.092
<i> As long as evil exists ...</ i></i>

08:08.468 --> 08:12.598
<i> ... live Mumm-Ra. </ i></i>

08:14.674 --> 08:16.904
What are you for something?

08:17.277 --> 08:23.307
You only need to
know that I am Mumm-Ra ...

08:23.483 --> 08:27.442
... and that I know led mission
This, the third world.

08:27.854 --> 08:33.451
You want to Thun Their eye.

08:33.626 --> 08:38.029
Do you know that?

08:38.198 --> 08:43.431
I have known
its forces in 1000 years ...

08:44.304 --> 08:50.334
... from a time when the
This was the first earth.

08:50.510 --> 08:55.880
Even if so, what makes you
to believe that we need your help?

08:56.049 --> 08:59.849
Driver you with my powers?

09:05.191 --> 09:09.992
Communication on
our ship has not been damaged.

09:10.163 --> 09:15.897
We can call on the other mutants as
they can shoot to pieces this place ...

09:16.069 --> 09:18.697
... and you also Mumm-Ra.

09:19.005 --> 09:24.500
Come and see your ship, stupid creatures.

09:36.990 --> 09:41.200
- Our shipping.
- Gone forever.

09:41.327 --> 09:45.696
... with the hope that the cold
on the other mutants.

09:45.865 --> 09:49.995
You are now stranded
in the third world ...

09:50.169 --> 09:54.765
... and without Mumm-Ra, you perish.

09:56.409 --> 10:03.900
- What do you think?
- We must go with him.

10:04.384 --> 10:11.800
There is enough
force in Thun Their eye for us all.

10:12.025 --> 10:18.900
It is true, Mumm-Ra.
It is only right that we share.

10:19.165 --> 10:26.500
- Slither speak for us all.
- We are with you, Mumm-Ra.

10:26.739 --> 10:33.900
Yes. I'm glad you agree.

10:34.347 --> 10:38.249
Look in the kettle again.

10:38.418 --> 10:44.323
So you see where
Thun Their eyes can be found.

10:48.094 --> 10:53.600
- It's Lion-O.
- Yes, lord of the Thundercats.

10:53.766 --> 11:01.400
- He wears a sword, but where is he?
- Maybe we can do an ambush.

11:02.342 --> 11:07.075
<i> They think that I can not leave my grave. </ i></i>

11:07.246 --> 11:10.113
<i> They should get a look at something else. </ i></i>

11:10.283 --> 11:15.949
<i> But they may not know the price
I have to pay to do it. </ i></i>

11:17.857 --> 11:21.657
Mumm-Ra transports you.

11:32.171 --> 11:36.505
Where you, Varlet,
and now you get a taste of my blade.

11:40.947 --> 11:43.279
What good hunting grounds.

11:52.492 --> 11:54.666
What is going on here?

11:59.632 --> 12:01.827
It is enough! I am ordering you to ...

12:02.001 --> 12:05.937
The sword does not obey you, Lion-O.

12:06.806 --> 12:10.367
- Chase?
- The sword never read an order ...

12:10.543 --> 12:15.800
- ... To destroy immoral.
- I would just have some fun.

12:15.948 --> 12:21.800
Fun? Your pantry is full now ...
And those creatures -

12:21.921 --> 12:25.789
-has as much right to
to live as you, Lion-O.

12:25.958 --> 12:30.224
The sword awakens only
to fight against evil.

12:30.396 --> 12:32.921
Do you understand?

12:33.099 --> 12:38.500
Yes, Chase, I guess so, but ...
Hunt?

12:38.638 --> 12:43.072
He is gone,
and I who have so many questions.

12:50.883 --> 12:53.579
What is it? Danger?

12:57.156 --> 13:00.182
I see no ... There are mutants again.

13:05.031 --> 13:08.296
Sword. Take the sword.

13:09.235 --> 13:13.797
That is what we are trying to do.

13:14.907 --> 13:19.310
Thunder, thunder, thunder.
Thundercats ...

13:30.323 --> 13:33.815
Thundercats, ho!

13:38.498 --> 13:42.264
Wilykat, Kit, Lion-O has problems.

13:42.702 --> 13:45.899
- Where is tygr and Cheetara?
- They are looking for a place ...

13:46.072 --> 13:51.600
- To build the sanctum.
- Then it's just us. Come on.

13:55.781 --> 13:58.682
Hang in there, Lion-O! We are here!

14:00.620 --> 14:03.453
I get along fine, Panthro.

14:09.529 --> 14:12.930
Retreat. Retreat.

14:20.106 --> 14:26.200
- No spaceships overhead.
- I like it.

14:26.312 --> 14:31.300
- They seem to have learned new tricks.
- Where is tygr and Cheetara?

14:31.450 --> 14:33.714
They are looking for a place to build.

14:33.886 --> 14:38.999
- Why did they not signal?
- Good question.

14:39.125 --> 14:43.200
I go and look for them.
It is best if it is I, Lion-O.

14:43.362 --> 14:48.800
- There may be problems, or ...
- I agree. I'm not a child anymore.

14:56.943 --> 15:03.075
They feared the mutants,
plagues the universe ...

15:03.249 --> 15:07.015
... will return with his tail between his legs?

15:07.186 --> 15:13.489
They have failed
to take an a lonely boy.

15:13.659 --> 15:18.790
We had him but the other
Thundercats came at the last minute.

15:19.599 --> 15:23.228
If you think it is
so easy to fight against the Thundercats ...

15:23.402 --> 15:25.900
... try myself next time.

15:26.072 --> 15:32.443
Yes, we have not seen
much of your powers than ...

15:32.745 --> 15:35.441
... mighty Mumm-Ra.

15:35.615 --> 15:40.814
Do you dare taunt Mumm-Ra, reptile?

15:40.987 --> 15:47.119
Then you will see on my strength,
for your grief.

15:49.895 --> 15:56.700
Ancient evil souls ...
Transform this derelict shape ...

15:56.802 --> 16:02.798
... to Mumm-Ra, the ever living!

16:22.928 --> 16:24.999
Tygr? - Cheetara?

16:26.699 --> 16:29.862
What is it? A black sea?

16:35.641 --> 16:37.888
It's hot ...

16:39.312 --> 16:42.888
... and sticky. It will not let go.

16:49.889 --> 16:51.999
Danger.

16:59.532 --> 17:03.800
What is that? I should ...
Thunder, thunder ...

17:03.903 --> 17:08.887
No. As the lord of the Thundercats, must
I fight against this demon alone.

17:30.029 --> 17:37.700
Do you think you can destroy Mumm-Ra?
It is not, boy.

17:37.903 --> 17:42.033
It always live?
This creature is not fatal.

17:42.208 --> 17:44.768
If only I could ...

17:47.646 --> 17:53.346
Thunder, thunder, thunder.
Thundercats!

17:56.455 --> 17:59.947
Thundercats!

18:05.131 --> 18:07.656
It does not matter, boy.

18:07.833 --> 18:14.033
Thun Their eyes can not call
hit your friends this time.

18:14.206 --> 18:18.199
I wish it could.

18:40.766 --> 18:48.500
Soon, I will
determine Thun Their eye.

19:07.059 --> 19:12.520
Yes, the rock of the cliff is enough
a good material for hiding.

19:12.698 --> 19:17.192
Listen, tygr. I thought
I heard a roaring.

19:17.369 --> 19:21.738
Something is going on and
we should check out what it is. Come!

19:46.232 --> 19:48.400
We heard the battle cry.

19:48.767 --> 19:52.700
Are you all right, Lion-O?
What was the fuss?

19:53.472 --> 19:55.872
You would not go himself.

19:56.509 --> 19:58.800
Look, Wilykit.

20:00.279 --> 20:02.679
What is the thing, Lion-O?

20:02.848 --> 20:08.000
He is called "Mumm-Ra, the
always live. "That's all I know.

20:16.128 --> 20:19.256
- Did you get it, Mumm-Ra?
- Did you make it, Mumm-Ra?

20:19.431 --> 20:22.992
Have you Thun Their eyes?

20:23.168 --> 20:28.100
He does not answer.
He did not get it.

20:30.309 --> 20:36.900
The mighty Mumm-Ra also failed.
Or?

20:37.917 --> 20:44.322
There will be another time.

20:54.033 --> 20:58.700
It was the reflection that drove
away ... and feared nothing.

20:58.804 --> 21:03.332
Apart from the evil of his
indescribable face.

21:03.509 --> 21:07.502
It was foolhardy to take
than that of matter itself, Lion-O.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.672
Courageous, too.

21:15.287 --> 21:21.300
I have never had the benefit of courage.
It is the only problem.
