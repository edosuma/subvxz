00:20.520 --> 00:22.600
Go on, Chris. Please take me.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.040
You've gotta be 16 for this one.

00:24.120 --> 00:27.160
I look 16. I definitely do.

00:27.240 --> 00:29.200
Is loan going to be there?

00:29.280 --> 00:31.240
Mom, I'm leaving.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.440
Have fun. Kisses.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.280
- Bye.
- Have a good time.

00:35.360 --> 00:36.640
Yeah, yeah.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.000
Oi, oi!

00:40.080 --> 00:42.400
- Hurry up and get in.
- There he is.

00:42.920 --> 00:44.000
Cool.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.680
Very nice.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.200
- It's my mum's.
- Really?

00:49.080 --> 00:49.920
Yeah?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.760
That's right. Designated drivers drive.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.760
- Designated drinkers...
- Yeah!

01:02.120 --> 01:03.480
- Right, it's there.
- Thank you.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.519
- Have fun.
- Goodbye.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.840
- Hey!
- Oi, chill.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.360
Watch your fucking self.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.080
Who's that?

01:14.160 --> 01:15.760
- You buyin'?
- Yeah, go on. How much?

01:23.680 --> 01:24.840
Down, down, down!

01:24.920 --> 01:26.440
Down, down, down!

01:26.520 --> 01:28.440
Down, down, down...

01:48.760 --> 01:49.720
What's happened? What's he done?

01:49.800 --> 01:50.640
What's wrong with you?

04:35.280 --> 04:36.760
Hey.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.880
Got a location?

04:38.960 --> 04:40.480
All right, I'm on my way.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.520
Zoe, why are you here?

04:51.600 --> 04:53.040
I'm here as a mother.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.880
Yes, but as a teacher
you've been suspended.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.560
So, let's not make an issue of this.

04:57.640 --> 05:00.080
Who's doing that?
We're just here to see Tilly.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.160
And you're welcome to stay.

05:02.240 --> 05:04.880
But I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

05:10.320 --> 05:13.120
Yeah, okay.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.400
I'm about to lose my temper.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.160
If you wanna find out what that's like,
just keep this up.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.720
'Cause we'll go when we're good and ready.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.480
So, back off.

05:47.760 --> 05:50.280
Step aside, please?
Let us see. Thanks.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.320
Yeah, okay, it's Chris Chahal.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.080
You okay?

06:20.480 --> 06:21.520
Yeah.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.120
I was just thinking
since there's no sign of Jenny,

06:24.200 --> 06:26.280
we should probably search the reservoir
for her.

06:26.840 --> 06:28.600
Yes. Yeah, yeah, of course.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.440
And it's an across-the-board
news blackout

06:33.520 --> 06:35.680
until we have spoken to the parents.

06:35.760 --> 06:36.600
Thank you.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.560
Let's go.

07:04.280 --> 07:05.400
Zoe, can we come in, please?

07:06.480 --> 07:07.440
Oh, no.

07:08.440 --> 07:09.640
No, it's not possible.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.760
- Zoe.
- No.

07:13.080 --> 07:15.440
- No, please don't say. No.
- Mr. Chahal, can we come in?

07:15.520 --> 07:17.720
- What is this?
- No, don't let them say it.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.040
- Zoe.
- I don't want to hear it.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.040
Don't you dare say it!

07:21.120 --> 07:22.320
It would be better if we came inside.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.000
I don't want to hear it.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.600
I don't want to hear it!

07:25.680 --> 07:29.520
No, please don't tell me that!

07:47.520 --> 07:48.760
Hello?

07:49.240 --> 07:51.600
Yes, hi. My name's Tom Delaney,

07:51.680 --> 07:54.800
and I'd like to speak
with someone, please.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.640
Do you have an appointment?

07:57.120 --> 07:59.960
No, but my inquiry shouldn't take long.

08:00.040 --> 08:02.080
It's Dr. Tom Delaney.

08:31.720 --> 08:32.799
Hi.

08:33.558 --> 08:34.520
Tom Delaney.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.679
Is it possible
to see one of your managers?

08:39.240 --> 08:40.080
Concerning?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.120
Well, Jasmine Hall.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.600
Well, yes. In regard to what?

08:45.680 --> 08:49.240
Are you a member of a care team?
A relative of a patient?

08:49.320 --> 08:50.160
No.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.480
Sir, we need to know
the purpose of your visit.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.400
This is a secure unit.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.720
Of course.

08:56.520 --> 09:01.640
Uh, my daughter, Jenny, 16 years old,
has gone missing,

09:01.720 --> 09:05.560
and, in a note, she mentioned this place.

09:05.640 --> 09:11.080
Well, I assume it was this place.
That's what I'm trying to establish.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.680
Maybe someone's seen her?

09:17.240 --> 09:20.000
Has she visited anyone here?

09:20.760 --> 09:22.160
Bear with me.

09:44.920 --> 09:46.760
Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

09:52.600 --> 09:54.200
One more thing.

09:55.040 --> 10:00.320
I have to ask one of you to make
a formal identification of Chris' body.

10:04.240 --> 10:05.560
I'm sorry.

10:10.040 --> 10:10.880
I'll do it.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.040
No.

10:14.760 --> 10:15.720
No.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.880
Is there anyone else
you'd prefer to do this for you?

10:23.160 --> 10:24.160
Together.

10:25.000 --> 10:25.960
Yes?

10:30.680 --> 10:31.520
Together.

10:33.160 --> 10:34.520
Can we do it now?

10:37.520 --> 10:38.920
You can, yeah.

10:51.120 --> 10:54.080
That's all from us now
on this Wednesday lunchtime.

10:54.160 --> 10:55.680
Marcus, how's the weather looking?

10:55.760 --> 10:59.000
No news is good news.

11:08.480 --> 11:12.160
- What's happened?
- Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.960
Life is returning to normal. That's all.

11:16.040 --> 11:19.200
So, keep giving it the... Yeah?

11:19.280 --> 11:20.720
Just do it with a smile.

11:37.240 --> 11:38.280
Tom.

11:38.760 --> 11:42.080
I'm due in theater. I'm just...

11:46.160 --> 11:47.400
Jenny?

11:49.560 --> 11:50.920
Sweetheart?

11:53.120 --> 11:54.360
Jenny?

12:00.920 --> 12:04.960
I had a feeling she'd been back.
So much for feelings.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.120
What?

12:11.480 --> 12:14.600
Chris Chahal's body was found
at Whitdon Reservoir this morning.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.200
But we don't yet know the cause of death.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.440
Preliminary inspection suggests drowning.

12:20.280 --> 12:21.400
And we are searching the reservoir.

12:21.480 --> 12:24.440
But there's no need to think
that anything's happened to Jenny.

12:27.520 --> 12:28.360
Dead how long?

12:28.440 --> 12:30.160
It's too early to say.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.320
- Rough guess.
- Why?

12:33.400 --> 12:37.280
'Cause the night of the party,
after the party, Jenny was alive.

12:37.360 --> 12:40.160
I know she was.
I've seen the CCTV footage.

12:40.240 --> 12:43.960
She caught the train to visit this guy
in the city, and she was on her own.

12:44.040 --> 12:46.600
- Visit what guy?
- He owns a bar called...

12:46.680 --> 12:48.760
Well, you were at school with him.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.200
He went out with Rachel.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.000
Bobby.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.920
- No, Archie Roberts. Sorry.
- Archie Roberts?

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Yeah, Rachel's boyfriend, right.

12:59.080 --> 13:02.600
Well, hardly. I mean,
maybe at school, sort of. I mean...

13:02.680 --> 13:04.800
I haven't seen or heard from him...
Wait, he owns a bar?

13:04.880 --> 13:06.280
Heaven Lounge, yeah.

13:06.360 --> 13:07.760
Sorry, Jenny went to see him why?

13:07.840 --> 13:09.560
I don't know why.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.560
He wasn't there.
That's not what's important.

13:11.640 --> 13:17.680
What I'm saying is she was alive
when, maybe, Chris was already dead.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.600
I'm just trying to keep her alive.

13:20.680 --> 13:24.880
There's nothing to indicate
that she isn't. Nothing at all.

13:24.960 --> 13:27.640
And for what it's worth,
we do get feelings about this.

13:27.720 --> 13:30.920
I think she's still out there.
So, you need to keep the faith, all right?

13:32.880 --> 13:36.520
I do need to ask, though, if I can take
something away to sample her DNA.

13:41.960 --> 13:42.800
It's Pete.

13:42.880 --> 13:44.000
Can I look in her room?

13:44.840 --> 13:45.840
Yeah.

13:47.080 --> 13:47.920
Hey.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.560
Tom, where are you?

13:49.640 --> 13:51.000
Yeah, sorry.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.200
Can I give the Hutchings boy his pre-med?

13:53.280 --> 13:56.320
- The Hutchings boy.
- The kid is never well enough.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.880
This time he is. Come on, mate.

13:57.960 --> 14:00.000
This is our window.
There may not be another.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.200
Pre-med in 15. I'm almost there.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.120
Sophie?

14:04.640 --> 14:07.120
Sorry, I have to dash.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.000
I'm wanted in theater.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.240
- I should be there now.
- Okay.

14:17.680 --> 14:19.880
Are you sure you should be going to...

14:29.200 --> 14:30.920
- Hey, how's it going?
- Yeah.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.040
The Chahals are doing the ID
with the liaison officer now.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.920
Has the pathologist arrived?

14:36.480 --> 14:37.640
Ready and waiting.

14:37.720 --> 14:38.960
Leave them to it,

14:39.040 --> 14:40.880
and meet me at the station, okay?

15:15.760 --> 15:18.520
I've got new information
on Jenny Delaney.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.120
So, her father's been looking for her.

15:20.200 --> 15:25.120
Now, he says she went to the Heaven Lounge
bar in Amberton after the party.

15:25.200 --> 15:28.320
Says he's seen CCTV footage of the bar.
Let's check that out.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.240
And also see if we can pick her up

15:30.320 --> 15:32.520
and track her from the CCTV
from the station, yeah?

15:32.600 --> 15:33.920
On it.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.280
Emma, pull up the other photos
from the crime scene, please?

15:36.360 --> 15:37.640
Thanks.

15:44.720 --> 15:45.800
There you go.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.920
Take me through them.
You tell me what you see.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.040
Let's go.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.640
Come on. Analyze.

16:13.360 --> 16:16.920
There's some... discoloration.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.800
Some slight abrasions.

16:22.720 --> 16:23.840
Bruising.

16:25.440 --> 16:26.440
So...

16:27.000 --> 16:28.320
I'm sorry.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.760
I didn't transfer here
because of a bad break-up.

17:07.598 --> 17:10.118
I transferred because a colleague...

17:11.800 --> 17:16.440
a fellow officer,
was killed in a hit-and-run.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.960
We'd set up a checkpoint.

17:27.598 --> 17:30.960
And the first car slowed.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.640
It was about to stop.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.360
And as this officer stepped forward...

17:40.240 --> 17:42.840
it just ran him down and raced off.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.280
He was killed outright and...

18:02.840 --> 18:04.680
Weeks later, even now, I...

18:04.760 --> 18:06.280
You're still struggling.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.760
I thought if I moved away...

18:11.240 --> 18:12.520
And it felt good,

18:13.320 --> 18:14.600
coming here. I...

18:14.680 --> 18:16.280
I was doing okay.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.160
But when I saw
Chris Chahal's face this morning, I...

18:21.240 --> 18:22.680
Okay, Emma, listen.

18:22.760 --> 18:25.240
- I want you...
- Please don't send me home.

18:25.320 --> 18:26.360
Please keep me on the case.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.960
I want you to see the force psychologist.

18:30.440 --> 18:33.680
If you can use them
without hiding, they help.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.560
But you have to want it.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.040
Open up, okay?

18:39.760 --> 18:41.840
Good, 'cause we need you.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.760
Take your time, yeah?

18:47.440 --> 18:48.480
Okay.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.800
We'll have a nice barbie
this evening.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.160
Why don't you marinade some chicken?

19:11.240 --> 19:12.440
Do you think we should?

19:14.840 --> 19:17.600
Lauren... sweetheart.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.840
What would we be doing
if none of this had happened, huh?

19:22.920 --> 19:27.400
Having a nice barbecue by the pool.
Being our usual flaunt-it-all selves.

19:28.120 --> 19:30.680
It's hiding indoors
that attracts attention.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.360
So, marinade.

19:39.360 --> 19:40.720
So, what's going on?

19:43.760 --> 19:46.040
Jenny's boyfriend, Chris, is dead.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.040
Drowned.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.160
Whitdon Reservoir.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.560
Nothing on Jenny.

19:57.480 --> 19:58.320
Damn.

19:58.880 --> 19:59.720
Yeah.

20:01.440 --> 20:02.920
And I went back to Jasmine Hall.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.840
- I got thrown out of Jasmine Hall.
- For what?

20:06.760 --> 20:08.240
I was looking for Jenny's name...

20:09.000 --> 20:09.880
What?

20:12.800 --> 20:13.640
Hey.

20:15.400 --> 20:18.640
- You were at that party last Saturday.
- Eh?

20:18.720 --> 20:20.160
At Sia Marshall's place.

20:20.240 --> 20:22.160
- My daughter was there.
- I know nothing about that.

20:22.240 --> 20:23.600
Jenny Delaney.

20:23.680 --> 20:27.000
I've just had my fucking leg cast off.
I wasn't anywhere Saturday.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.800
Sorry.

20:31.520 --> 20:34.400
- What was that about?
- I thought I...

20:35.560 --> 20:38.000
When you picked up Jenny at the party,

20:38.080 --> 20:40.480
- did you see that guy?
- I don't know.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.080
Hang on.

20:46.720 --> 20:49.080
I told you to come to this party...

20:51.160 --> 20:52.240
It's him.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.880
The guy with the plaster, right?

21:12.840 --> 21:13.800
Tom?

21:14.280 --> 21:15.640
Orthopedics.

21:17.600 --> 21:18.440
Hi.

21:18.520 --> 21:21.200
You just took the leg plaster
off this guy.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.880
- Who is he? What's his name?
- I can't give you that!

21:23.960 --> 21:25.360
Hi, how are you doing?

21:25.440 --> 21:27.800
We just saw the guy get into a cab,
clutching his leg.

21:27.880 --> 21:31.880
I went, "Whoa, DVT! They're gonna have
a malpractice suit on their hands."

21:31.960 --> 21:35.120
That is a pulmonary embolism
waiting to happen.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.040
Got it!

21:36.120 --> 21:37.640
How about that?
It's like nothing happened.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.920
Thank you and goodbye!

21:47.960 --> 21:48.800
What?

21:48.880 --> 21:51.600
The water in Chris Chahal's lungs
is chlorinated.

21:53.960 --> 21:55.440
He didn't drown in the reservoir?

21:55.520 --> 21:59.080
No. And the party was the last place
he was seen alive.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.040
At the Marshalls'.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.640
Which has a swimming pool.

22:07.960 --> 22:08.840
Hello?

22:27.840 --> 22:29.240
What is going on?

22:30.080 --> 22:31.800
Life returns to normal.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.400
Can I get out? 'Cause I'm actually cold.

22:33.480 --> 22:34.920
Do this properly. Do some lengths.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.800
Why not have a swim before we eat?
What do you fancy?

22:37.880 --> 22:40.480
We got chicken. We got...

22:59.720 --> 23:01.240
They've found him.

23:01.320 --> 23:04.040
We say nothing, all right?
Nothing at all.

23:04.560 --> 23:05.760
We can't do that...

23:05.840 --> 23:07.200
We don't have our story straight!

23:07.280 --> 23:09.680
Just do as you're told
for once in your life!

23:09.760 --> 23:10.680
We'll use the lawyers.

23:10.760 --> 23:11.760
I'll get us the best.

23:11.840 --> 23:14.200
You, don't say a fucking word!

23:14.280 --> 23:15.520
Okay?

23:15.600 --> 23:16.800
They're in the back garden.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.680
Mr. Marshall!

23:22.760 --> 23:23.960
Or Mrs. Marshall,

23:24.040 --> 23:26.920
or Sia, could you open
the front door, please?

23:27.000 --> 23:28.280
Stay where you are.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.480
I'm talking to our lawyers,

23:30.560 --> 23:33.200
and until we're advised otherwise,
we have nothing to say.

23:33.280 --> 23:35.280
- Why don't we save our breath?
- I saw the body.

23:35.360 --> 23:36.520
Sia!

23:36.600 --> 23:38.240
- I live across there.
- Over there, please.

23:38.320 --> 23:39.520
They did this. Coshed me.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.000
- They coshed me.
- Don't listen to him.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.640
- He's a fantasist.
- They tied me up in the shower room,

23:42.720 --> 23:46.320
kept me there for hours,
and then they made threats.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.720
And she is the worst.

23:47.800 --> 23:49.720
We're exercising our right
to remain silent.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.160
About what, Mr. Marshall?

24:02.000 --> 24:05.680
'Course, the address he gives
is not necessarily where he lives.

24:09.560 --> 24:11.240
Thanks for being here.

24:16.960 --> 24:17.920
Here we go.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.720
This is near where Rachel worked.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.320
That's it, down the end.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.840
- You remember Rachel's office?
- Yeah.

25:37.840 --> 25:38.840
Take a look.

25:51.240 --> 25:52.080
Dr. Delaney?

25:53.040 --> 25:54.280
Yes. Hi.

25:54.360 --> 25:55.800
Sorry. Yeah.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.480
Young guy on a bike just came in?

25:57.560 --> 26:00.080
- Scott.
- Been and gone. Out back.

26:00.160 --> 26:02.480
- I'll drive round.
- Okay.

26:03.080 --> 26:03.920
Scott comes here?

26:04.000 --> 26:08.240
Used to. I mean, we hadn't seen him
since Rachel died, but...

26:09.320 --> 26:11.960
After what you said about this...

26:12.040 --> 26:14.400
You were right. It was a shrine.

26:14.480 --> 26:17.280
So, we cleared it out,
and we offered some of her things

26:17.360 --> 26:18.720
to kids who connected with her.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.720
And I wasn't expecting it,

26:20.800 --> 26:22.600
but Scott's just turned up.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.920
He wanted to have something of Rachel's.

26:26.560 --> 26:27.760
Is this what's left?

26:27.840 --> 26:31.880
Yeah, that's just everything we thought
would be of interest to Jenny and Carrie.

26:33.040 --> 26:34.480
And yourself, of course.

26:35.480 --> 26:36.440
Is it all right if I...

26:36.520 --> 26:38.160
Of course. Yeah.

27:19.080 --> 27:20.240
How's it going?

27:20.320 --> 27:21.480
Couldn't see him.

27:21.560 --> 27:23.280
I'm back outside his flat.
Want me to stay here?

27:23.360 --> 27:28.040
Well, I'm just checking
through Rachel's things for...

27:28.120 --> 27:31.240
anything on Jasmine Hall,
or some hint about Jenny.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.440
Okay. Walk over when you're done.

27:34.840 --> 27:35.720
Will do.

27:45.920 --> 27:47.040
Gimme some!

27:47.120 --> 27:48.200
- You are dazzling.
- Smile!

27:48.280 --> 27:49.440
Baby, baby.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.560
- Get in closer.
- You're blocking my view.

27:51.640 --> 27:53.280
- Cheers!
- You can't see me!

27:53.360 --> 27:54.600
Baby, baby!

28:40.000 --> 28:41.560
Mr. Marshall.

28:41.640 --> 28:45.120
My client has stated that he does not
wish to make a statement at this moment.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.560
I know he doesn't have to say anything.

28:47.640 --> 28:51.120
But just so we all
completely understand the situation...

28:52.080 --> 28:54.720
The body of a young man,
last seen alive at your house,

28:54.800 --> 28:57.680
at your daughter's party,
has been found at Whitdon reservoir.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.520
He has chlorinated water in his lungs.

29:00.600 --> 29:02.840
You have a swimming pool.
We've taken samples.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.120
Your neighbor says he saw you

29:05.200 --> 29:07.760
with the body of a young man
at your house yesterday.

29:07.840 --> 29:11.120
He says you and your family
then attacked and imprisoned him.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.360
How's this all looking?

29:19.320 --> 29:22.240
Because, as the prime suspect
in a murder investigation,

29:22.960 --> 29:25.680
I'd get a second opinion
on staying silent.

29:31.680 --> 29:34.160
Pathologist says the discoloration
on Chris Chahal's neck

29:34.240 --> 29:36.520
is bruising consistent with a struggle.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.160
And it matches the time of death.

29:38.960 --> 29:39.920
Is the post-mortem over?

29:40.000 --> 29:41.280
No, not yet.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.960
But the chlorinated water in his lungs
plus this suggests

29:45.040 --> 29:48.200
that he was drowned in the swimming pool
and then moved to the reservoir.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.200
Suggests... Well, I agree.

29:51.280 --> 29:53.480
Well, let's just wait and see
what else comes up, yeah?

29:54.440 --> 29:56.320
Shall we let Chris' parents know?

29:57.760 --> 29:59.600
They'll be telling Tilly.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.880
Could you get an update
from the liaison officer?

30:06.640 --> 30:07.720
What?

30:09.720 --> 30:12.400
This is inside Amberton train station.

30:14.840 --> 30:17.480
- It's Jenny Delaney.
- Keep watching.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.120
Oh, my God, that's Josh.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.720
This was taken
the night Jenny disappeared.

30:29.280 --> 30:31.480
Don't say anything
to anyone else.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.040
Sarge, you need to see these.

31:23.440 --> 31:26.760
Jenny Delaney came back to Chelton
the morning after the party.

31:28.040 --> 31:31.160
There's a chance
she came back to Somerville Acres.

31:32.560 --> 31:33.640
Good work.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.200
Let's see if anyone saw her come home.

31:36.280 --> 31:38.520
We'll do a house-to-house
of the community.

31:45.520 --> 31:48.040
We're thinking that Jenny came back here?

31:48.920 --> 31:50.880
She lives here.
Chris lives here.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.080
So, we knock on doors,

31:52.160 --> 31:56.760
and we see if anyone saw her the morning
after the party, later, whenever.

31:56.840 --> 31:59.080
Do you wanna get them started
down this end?

32:01.240 --> 32:02.160
Sure.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.840
Okay, you were in there.

32:58.080 --> 32:59.520
Can you search through that?

33:08.440 --> 33:09.560
Alex?

33:10.880 --> 33:13.320
These initials, J.H.

33:13.400 --> 33:16.400
Are they anything to do with Jasmine Hall?

33:17.880 --> 33:20.280
Does Jasmine Hall mean anything to you?

33:20.360 --> 33:24.680
Yeah, Rachel was big
on the center being for everyone,

33:24.760 --> 33:28.040
and Jasmine Hall's a psychiatric unit.

33:28.120 --> 33:32.760
And Rachel approached them and said
if any of their patients was well enough

33:32.840 --> 33:34.680
and would benefit from spending time here,

33:34.760 --> 33:36.000
then they were welcome.

33:37.320 --> 33:38.520
Sure.

33:38.600 --> 33:41.000
Of course. Thanks.

33:41.560 --> 33:44.000
Hey! Hey, what is this?

33:44.080 --> 33:46.720
What are you doing?
I think that's illegal entry.

33:46.800 --> 33:49.280
- Who's staying here with you?
- Remind me. Didn't we separate?

33:49.360 --> 33:50.720
A young woman's clothes are in there.

33:50.800 --> 33:52.640
- A friend's, yes.
- I haven't got time for this.

33:52.720 --> 33:53.640
- Is it Jenny?
- What?

33:53.720 --> 33:55.920
I won't repeat myself.
Is it Jenny?

33:56.000 --> 33:57.120
You just repeated yourself.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.240
- Is it Jenny?
- And again.

33:59.320 --> 34:01.520
Fuck, no. Why would it be Jenny?

34:01.600 --> 34:03.040
'Cause I know you've seen her

34:03.120 --> 34:05.600
in the city. I've seen the CCTV,
inside the station.

34:05.680 --> 34:08.239
So you better start talking now.

34:13.040 --> 34:15.000
Okay, yeah, I saw her.

34:15.080 --> 34:17.280
But she was just suddenly there.

34:20.880 --> 34:21.880
Jenny.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.440
Please don't tell anyone you've seen me.

34:26.320 --> 34:27.360
Please.

34:28.280 --> 34:30.239
There's things that people don't know.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.880
And that's all there is to know.
I promise.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.080
I saw her and she asked...

34:40.159 --> 34:42.280
No, she begged me not to tell anyone,
so I didn't.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.120
Tom's out of his mind with worry.

34:44.199 --> 34:46.840
We've all been trying to find her,
and you kept quiet?

34:46.920 --> 34:48.760
You're a prick.

34:48.840 --> 34:51.560
- Yeah.
- So, who does that stuff belong to?

34:51.639 --> 34:53.159
A girl. That's all.

34:53.239 --> 34:54.400
- This girl?
- Yes.

34:54.480 --> 34:55.800
- Oh, fuck.
- No, yeah, but no.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.680
No, hang on. Listen.
I saw her on the train.

34:58.760 --> 35:01.520
She was off her face, asking people
if she could crash on their floor.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.080
These guys were gathering round so...

35:03.160 --> 35:05.200
So you thought you'd help her.

35:05.280 --> 35:06.960
You know what? Okay, fuck you.

35:07.040 --> 35:10.080
Okay, look. Follow me. You too, Stretch.

35:13.880 --> 35:15.080
I'm sleeping here.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.280
I'm helping her out.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.720
I'm being nice.

35:20.320 --> 35:23.320
I can be, you know? Nice.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.840
Track her down. Make sure she's okay.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.160
Where are you?

35:30.880 --> 35:33.360
The other side of the railway arches.

35:33.440 --> 35:34.960
You know the estate?

35:35.440 --> 35:37.960
He's gone in there, mate.
I'm tracking him.

35:38.040 --> 35:40.680
- I'm gonna call you back.
- I'm on my way.

36:06.520 --> 36:07.760
Who's that guy?

36:12.080 --> 36:13.160
Fuck.

36:14.480 --> 36:16.080
Okay... What, what, what?

36:18.400 --> 36:19.240
Oi!

36:21.280 --> 36:22.760
- All right, mate.
- How's it going?

36:22.840 --> 36:24.360
- Yeah, you know...
- Yeah?

36:25.680 --> 36:27.080
Yeah, it's going great.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.600
- Get him!
- Get him!

36:32.800 --> 36:33.640
Fuck!

36:34.400 --> 36:35.800
Get him, man! Get him!

36:37.560 --> 36:38.640
Bring the bike!

36:40.160 --> 36:41.480
Stop him!

36:42.000 --> 36:44.320
Cut him down! Cut him off, man!
Cut him off!

36:46.320 --> 36:47.400
Pete?

36:48.840 --> 36:50.160
What's going on? Where are you?

36:50.960 --> 36:53.200
- Fuck!
- Pete?

36:53.280 --> 36:54.600
Pete, what's going on?

36:55.080 --> 36:56.680
All right, mate. I'm here.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.600
I think I've lost them, but...

36:59.680 --> 37:00.960
But it's getting dicey.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.680
Well, I'm coming to you.

37:02.760 --> 37:04.440
- Where are you?
- There he is!

37:05.440 --> 37:07.520
- What's going on?
- You're on your own now, mate.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.640
- What you doin' around here?
- Okay, come on.

37:09.720 --> 37:11.520
- Who are you, mate?
- You a fucking cop?

37:11.600 --> 37:12.800
Just take the fucking...

37:14.120 --> 37:15.280
- Get him!
- Get him, man!

37:21.680 --> 37:24.680
- Now cut him off, man! Cut him off!
- Go round the back!

37:28.040 --> 37:29.280
Talk to me, Pete!

37:34.840 --> 37:36.320
I've fucked it, mate.

37:36.400 --> 37:38.600
I've gotta get myself out of this one.

38:20.680 --> 38:21.560
Take it!

38:33.920 --> 38:34.920
Pete!

38:37.040 --> 38:38.160
God! Come on!

38:49.520 --> 38:50.360
Okay.

38:53.920 --> 38:55.080
You beauty.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.560
Check it, check it.

39:21.680 --> 39:23.520
That blood better be yours.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.200
Walk away.

39:27.240 --> 39:28.280
Where's Pete?

39:28.360 --> 39:29.200
Fuck off!

39:32.600 --> 39:34.080
My friend, where is he?

39:39.920 --> 39:43.120
I'm Rachel's husband, Scott, okay?

39:43.200 --> 39:46.560
So please just fucking tell me.
My friend is where?

39:47.280 --> 39:48.640
- They stabbed him.
- Stabbed?

39:48.720 --> 39:50.960
How bad? Is he still alive?

39:51.880 --> 39:52.920
Where is he?

39:56.720 --> 39:58.000
How's Tilly?

39:59.360 --> 40:00.800
We're not sure.

40:00.880 --> 40:03.880
We were wondering
if this is connected to Chris.

40:03.960 --> 40:06.600
In a way, yes.
We're making inquiries about Jenny.

40:06.680 --> 40:08.880
- She still hasn't been found?
- No.

40:08.960 --> 40:09.920
But she was with Chris, right?

40:11.080 --> 40:14.440
The minute we have anything concrete,
you will be the first to know. I promise.

40:16.360 --> 40:18.920
A liaison officer told us
to expect the press soon.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.760
We will be issuing a statement, yes.

40:48.520 --> 40:50.600
Pete! Fuck!

40:51.160 --> 40:52.000
Pete!

40:52.640 --> 40:53.480
Hey, stay!

40:53.560 --> 40:55.080
Call an ambulance!

40:56.920 --> 40:59.640
Okay. Okay, pulse.

41:01.840 --> 41:03.080
Stay with me, Pete!

41:10.640 --> 41:11.920
Helen, hi.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.200
We're asking everyone
when they last saw Jenny Delaney.

41:16.920 --> 41:18.840
Why? Has something happened?

41:19.400 --> 41:20.760
Well, she's been reported missing.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.880
Children have so much freedom these days.

41:24.840 --> 41:26.120
Is she in danger?

41:26.200 --> 41:28.400
Well, we found her boyfriend's body today.

41:28.480 --> 41:30.520
So, we're obviously
very worried about her.

41:30.600 --> 41:32.600
- Oh, dear.
- If you see or hear anything...

41:32.680 --> 41:34.640
Yes, of course.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.240
Fuck.

41:38.840 --> 41:40.400
Okay, give me your jacket.

41:41.880 --> 41:43.680
- How long did they say?
- They didn't.

41:44.520 --> 41:45.360
There's so much blood.

41:45.440 --> 41:46.840
Pete! Pete!

41:48.640 --> 41:50.240
Wallet, inside pocket.

41:51.480 --> 41:52.320
Wallet!

41:54.280 --> 41:55.320
Credit card.

41:56.160 --> 41:58.840
Okay, you apply pressure
on this wound here.

41:58.920 --> 42:00.360
Firm, firm.

42:00.440 --> 42:03.840
What we need is to create a seal.

42:05.720 --> 42:07.280
Come on, Pete! Come on!

42:07.840 --> 42:08.800
Come on!

42:09.840 --> 42:10.680
No, no.

42:15.720 --> 42:16.880
Come on.

42:42.480 --> 42:44.520
They said they found his body.
