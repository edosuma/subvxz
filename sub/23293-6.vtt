WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:08.360
Where is the surgical instruments kit
that the professor gave us?

00:08.440 --> 00:10.440
-There is a scalpel over there.
-Berlin has got it.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.600
The surgeons! Go and steal
the instruments from them. Hurry!

00:14.680 --> 00:16.520
-Okay.
-Wait! Wait!

00:17.200 --> 00:18.520
Give him the note, please.

00:30.840 --> 00:33.520
SATURDAY
06:31 PM

00:38.120 --> 00:40.800
33 HOURS INTO THE ROBBERY

01:22.800 --> 01:23.720
What?

01:25.600 --> 01:27.600
Sometimes on TV there are people like you.

01:28.840 --> 01:29.760
Like me, like what?

01:30.640 --> 01:31.560
Robbers.

01:33.120 --> 01:36.520
But you don't look like one.
I can tell this isn't your thing.

01:36.920 --> 01:37.800
Why?

01:39.560 --> 01:41.120
The way you hold the rifle.

01:48.520 --> 01:51.000
I thought you were the ambassador's
daughter, and not Rambo.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.560
Well, my father always wanted
to have a son

01:54.480 --> 01:57.920
and since I was five years old
he’s been taking me shooting.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.400
Shooting? What at?

02:01.200 --> 02:02.560
At sticks in the funfair?

02:04.160 --> 02:05.920
At wild hogs, red deer,

02:06.360 --> 02:07.360
antelopes...

02:08.400 --> 02:11.720
But what my father would like
is to hunt ecologists.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.400
But I don't like guns.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.600
Once, in Norwich...

02:24.440 --> 02:27.960
the rifle of my father's friend went off.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.200
I saw everything.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.760
The shot in his back,
the people screaming...

02:37.960 --> 02:39.080
It's like...

02:40.800 --> 02:44.120
when you see an accident on the road
and it gets stuck in your head, the...

02:45.240 --> 02:46.400
blood stain.

02:50.920 --> 02:51.840
Anyway...

02:57.640 --> 02:59.160
It's not loaded, okay?

03:02.040 --> 03:03.080
Don't be scared.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.200
What do you think, doctor?

03:18.320 --> 03:19.320
Will I make it?

03:19.960 --> 03:22.720
The bullet is located...

03:23.120 --> 03:24.480
in the clavicle.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.720
It's not touching any vital organs

03:28.360 --> 03:30.000
and I can't see any...

03:31.000 --> 03:32.120
bone fragments.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.320
No one is going to die from this.

03:37.320 --> 03:38.320
Let's get going.

03:38.920 --> 03:41.040
"Denver had no time for diagnoses."

03:42.000 --> 03:44.120
-Anaesthesia.
-"Mónica was losing a lot of blood.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.760
If he didn't take the scalpels soon,

03:48.400 --> 03:50.720
having spared her life would be in vain."

03:50.960 --> 03:52.400
What kind of anaesthesia will you use?

03:52.480 --> 03:55.000
In this cases like this it's better
to use total sedation.

03:55.240 --> 03:56.120
No.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.720
Better to use local anaesthesia.

04:00.360 --> 04:04.800
So my friend and I can chat
during the surgery, can't we, Arturito?

04:13.840 --> 04:14.720
Relax, relax.

04:23.720 --> 04:24.960
Okay, okay, that's it.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.320
And that clock, what's it for?

04:35.480 --> 04:39.040
To control the duration
of the local anaesthesia, 25 minutes.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.280
If anything should go wrong
during the surgery,

04:41.360 --> 04:43.080
we should give him one more dose.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.400
Show the clock on the screen.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.280
"That operation was scheduled

04:53.640 --> 04:57.600
and had to last exactly 25 minutes
as the inspector had ordered.

04:58.040 --> 05:00.840
That countdown would allow two
police officers wearing face masks of Dali

05:00.920 --> 05:02.360
inside the factory

05:02.920 --> 05:06.760
or, if it went wrong, two dead bodies
inside the ventilation ducts."

05:07.480 --> 05:08.800
Drop the fucking rifle.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.240
It's not loaded,
drop it before I get really pissed off.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.880
The bullet in the breech.

06:26.760 --> 06:28.000
Suárez, do you read me?

06:28.320 --> 06:29.240
Duct clear.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.120
"We're moving towards the target."

06:43.880 --> 06:45.880
Turn around
and put your hands behind your head.

06:48.640 --> 06:49.520
Now!

06:53.520 --> 06:54.400
Now!

06:56.160 --> 06:57.040
So.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.440
What now? Not so tough now, are you?

07:00.920 --> 07:02.800
Move, for fuck's sake, move!

07:03.680 --> 07:04.560
Shoot now.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.080
You fucking crazy little girl.
On your knees!

07:09.440 --> 07:10.320
Scalpel.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.320
Stop, stop, stop.
It’s me who gives the arms out here.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.000
Scalpel.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.080
You nailed it earlier on,
didn't you, Arturo?

07:24.240 --> 07:25.960
Changing your wife's name.

07:28.720 --> 07:29.960
Of course, it's normal.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.000
Fornicating in the mornings with Mónica,

07:34.520 --> 07:35.960
spending the afternoons with Laura...

07:36.640 --> 07:37.840
It's normal to get confused.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.600
But I love them both.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.320
That’s the truth.

07:44.560 --> 07:48.320
When you're in my situation,
it's very easy to judge. Everyone...

07:49.760 --> 07:51.520
thinks you're a scoundrel,

07:52.160 --> 07:53.920
a son of a bitch.

07:54.280 --> 07:57.240
Far be it from me,
to make moral judgments.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.760
I can understand everything.

08:15.280 --> 08:19.680
You can talk freely
about anything with me.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.640
But, in fact I’m a wretch,

08:25.560 --> 08:28.160
a poor man who is in love with two women

08:29.800 --> 08:32.840
and who hasn't got the guts,
to choose one of them.

08:34.040 --> 08:36.240
“And in the middle
of that infidelity declaration,

08:36.440 --> 08:38.080
Denver got the scalpel he needed,

08:38.280 --> 08:41.800
and the love note Mónica
had thrown into the sea was lost

08:42.480 --> 08:44.280
or almost because Nairobi,

08:44.360 --> 08:47.520
always paying close attention
to any detail, spotted it."

08:48.960 --> 08:52.200
-What the fuck did you do that for?
-I don't know, I'm sorry.

08:58.040 --> 08:58.920
I'm sorry.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.280
To the ground!

09:16.040 --> 09:18.880
-You're 11 metres from the entrance.
-"Copy that."

09:19.520 --> 09:20.400
We're proceeding.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.880
Fucking little spoiled brat!

09:28.880 --> 09:31.040
-I'm sorry.
-Shut the fuck up!

09:31.200 --> 09:32.640
Don't tell me your life story, okay?

09:32.720 --> 09:35.120
I'm not the fucking friend
of the outcast, understood?

09:36.760 --> 09:39.160
If you go around begging for
your kidnapper's friendship,

09:39.240 --> 09:40.360
you're so screwed.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.320
Do you know what...?

10:00.600 --> 10:03.040
I'm only six weeks pregnant and...

10:03.880 --> 10:06.200
I'm more concerned
about the kid's life than my own?

10:06.840 --> 10:08.760
You need more than an infection

10:08.840 --> 10:12.000
to stop children
from taking on the world, my dear.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.560
Listen, what's your name?

10:16.400 --> 10:18.560
Moscow, they call me Moscow.

10:18.840 --> 10:19.800
Listen, Moscow,

10:21.440 --> 10:22.440
and what's it like...

10:23.400 --> 10:24.400
being...?

10:25.240 --> 10:26.520
I mean, being a parent.

10:28.760 --> 10:29.760
Being a parent...

10:33.240 --> 10:38.720
You see, being a parent means that
all of a sudden a pile of problems

10:39.040 --> 10:42.480
falls right on your shoulders
and also for the rest of your life.

10:43.640 --> 10:47.360
In a few words,
being worried for the rest of your life.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.240
First, it's the baby's colds.

10:51.360 --> 10:54.240
That means you'll be
in the emergency room every weekend

10:54.360 --> 10:55.880
instead of going for a drink.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.920
I don't mind, I don't drink.

10:58.280 --> 11:02.120
You don’t know what you’re missing,
you don't know how good a Pacharán feels

11:02.280 --> 11:04.800
when you leave him
there sleeping like an angel in his cot.

11:06.760 --> 11:07.960
And then there's school.

11:09.880 --> 11:10.760
The fear...

11:11.480 --> 11:13.080
that all parents feel of...

11:13.360 --> 11:16.800
your son being the dummy
and the punching bag in his class.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.680
I mean, what’s known as "bullying" now.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.720
The fact is that in my case...

11:21.680 --> 11:24.080
it was my son who did the beating.

11:25.720 --> 11:27.600
He was being expelled all the time.

11:28.040 --> 11:30.400
I can’t tell how many schools
he went to, that...

11:31.600 --> 11:34.480
And then his mum, poor her,
she had her bad habits...

11:34.560 --> 11:35.880
Well, not that poor?

11:37.680 --> 11:40.000
She dumped me there, on my own...

11:40.600 --> 11:41.720
Soldiering.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.840
Because in the end, all you want is...

11:46.640 --> 11:48.200
him to be normal,

11:48.800 --> 11:51.960
him not to end up
on a corner, smoking joints

11:52.840 --> 11:54.560
instead of going to school.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.040
But being a parent...

12:00.240 --> 12:02.120
is good. It's very...

12:03.160 --> 12:05.760
Hey, no, no! Mónica, stay with me!

12:06.320 --> 12:08.720
Look at me, look at me!
Stay with me, darling.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.000
-Come on, look at me!
-Dad!

12:10.080 --> 12:11.040
-That's it.
-What's wrong?

12:11.200 --> 12:12.520
-What's wrong?
-Nothing, it's okay.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.400
-Yes?
-Her temperature is too high.

12:14.480 --> 12:17.080
No, don't stop looking at me.
Let's see, look at me, that's it.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.640
I've got everything with me.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.840
"Five minutes left
for the doctors to come out."

12:28.760 --> 12:29.760
Copy that.

12:33.920 --> 12:34.800
It’s out.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.240
Thanks.

12:44.560 --> 12:45.800
And now you stitch him up.

12:47.040 --> 12:47.920
Who, me?

12:48.840 --> 12:50.520
Yes, you.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.160
You're a nurse, aren't you?

12:55.240 --> 12:57.400
-Yes, I am.
-So, then.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.120
It's local anaesthesia.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.680
We put it on the wound
and in a jiffy... no pain.

13:05.880 --> 13:06.760
Yes.

13:20.720 --> 13:22.240
Come on, allow me, I'll do it.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.240
-You keep checking her pulse.
-Right.

13:27.200 --> 13:31.440
There we go...
Done, now, that’s it, that’s it.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.880
Do you know what I'm going to do
when... I get out of here?

13:35.400 --> 13:37.560
I'm going to study long-distance.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.080
You haven't studied in your whole life.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.120
I'm not saying that I'll study medicine,
but I'll...

13:43.360 --> 13:45.440
take it up where I left it, you know?

13:45.640 --> 13:47.760
This is going to hurt a little more, okay?

13:47.920 --> 13:48.840
Look, look. Oh!

13:49.680 --> 13:50.720
Done.

13:51.440 --> 13:52.480
Right, done.

13:52.560 --> 13:53.800
-Ready.
-Ready.

13:53.960 --> 13:57.000
Now, in five minutes
it'll start working and...

13:58.240 --> 13:59.680
we'll start to open up, okay?

13:59.960 --> 14:01.080
-Come on.
-Ready.

14:09.080 --> 14:12.160
-You're within two metres of the entrance.
-We can visualize the target.

14:34.640 --> 14:35.680
Let's see...

14:35.760 --> 14:37.960
I'm not feeling well.
I think I'm going to be sick.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.800
Are you a nurse, a ballet dancer?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

14:40.880 --> 14:41.960
I'm a nurse,

14:42.440 --> 14:44.880
but I'm not used to working
surrounded by guns.

14:44.960 --> 14:47.240
Right, that's enough. I'll stitch him up.

14:47.560 --> 14:50.680
But I want everyone to remain silent
please.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.360
Come on, start.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.480
Tweezers.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.480
The Professor wants to speak to you.

15:05.640 --> 15:08.200
All right. Take the nurse
to the toilet so he can vomit.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.880
If he doesn't, put his head
inside the loo until he does it.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.360
Do you hear me? Until he does.

15:14.000 --> 15:14.960
Good bye, Arturo.

15:15.720 --> 15:16.720
Come on.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.400
Walk.

15:18.600 --> 15:19.480
Walk.

15:25.720 --> 15:28.280
They're broadcasting on short wave
and it's encrypted, so they're getting in,

15:28.360 --> 15:30.880
-but I don't know from where.
-Copy, I’m moving to plan B.

15:30.960 --> 15:33.240
"Okay and get the medical team
out of there right now."

15:33.640 --> 15:34.520
Now.

15:46.600 --> 15:50.560
"My darling, be strong. I'm fine.
I love you. Mónica."

16:12.520 --> 16:15.360
"Sub-inspector Ángel knew
in less than a second

16:15.440 --> 16:17.080
that they had lost another battle.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.560
Those sinister masks
meant that they’re going to throw

16:19.640 --> 16:21.120
two men in at the deep end.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.600
Also that the guy
who had planned that robbery

16:23.680 --> 16:26.640
was smarter
and had more imagination than the police,

16:26.840 --> 16:29.280
the CNI and the Intervention Unit,

16:29.680 --> 16:31.120
and when they're well ahead of you,

16:32.320 --> 16:33.560
it's time to run."

16:33.840 --> 16:35.360
We have to leave now.

16:39.320 --> 16:42.520
Miss, excuse me, we're done here.
Can we go now, please?

16:43.160 --> 16:44.280
-Yes.
-Yes?

16:44.360 --> 16:45.440
Calmly.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.800
You, follow me.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.960
Doctor, doctor!

16:57.280 --> 16:58.280
Just one moment.

16:58.520 --> 16:59.960
One minute, 30 seconds.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.320
-What's wrong?
-They have frequency inhibitors.

17:05.520 --> 17:06.840
Suárez, do you copy?

17:07.200 --> 17:08.800
They've installed frequency inhibitors.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.720
I think communication will be lost.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.760
"Do you read me?"

17:15.360 --> 17:18.000
There are frequency inhibitors.
We're losing communication.

17:18.160 --> 17:19.040
Suárez.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.120
How did the surgery go?

17:21.920 --> 17:25.200
Well, but we should come back in 24 hours.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.120
Thank you for your interest,
but, for the post-op

17:29.200 --> 17:30.880
we have enough qualified people.

17:32.640 --> 17:36.240
My friend, the nurse...
Are you feeling better now?

17:36.400 --> 17:38.280
-Yes, yes, thanks.
-I'm glad to hear.

17:38.400 --> 17:41.520
Excuse me if I can't see you off,
but I leave you in good hands.

17:41.960 --> 17:42.840
Good bye.

17:43.120 --> 17:44.360
-Good bye.
-Good bye.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.720
Give our regards to the people outside!

18:06.000 --> 18:08.480
-Did you tell Arturo that I'm fine?
-Sorry?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.960
Did you tell Arturo that I'm alive?

18:12.080 --> 18:15.400
-Yes. No... I didn't tell him.
-Did you or you didn’t?

18:15.480 --> 18:16.800
I gave him the note.

18:22.800 --> 18:23.960
And what did he say?

18:24.960 --> 18:28.520
Damn, he was overjoyed. He was overjoyed,
what was he supposed to say?

18:28.600 --> 18:29.480
-That...
-Go on.

18:29.560 --> 18:30.440
That...

18:31.280 --> 18:33.640
-That he loves you very much.
-What else?

18:34.240 --> 18:35.400
He said that...

18:36.040 --> 18:39.480
That when you two get out of here,
he's going to take you to Australia.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.240
To Australia?

18:43.640 --> 18:44.520
Yes.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.080
I can't see it.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.200
He also told me that he doesn't know
what you saw in him to like him.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.640
-To Australia?
-Yes, Australia.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.640
It's his wife's dream destination.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.080
Besides, Arturo knows
I'm scared of flying.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.760
What happened?
His wife went in with the doctors?

19:07.320 --> 19:09.160
-Has Laura been here?
-No.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.720
-Yes.
-He told her on the phone.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.400
-Suárez!
-Command post, do you read me?

19:31.480 --> 19:33.200
Command post, do you read me?

19:35.360 --> 19:36.240
Shit.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.920
Inspector, the surgeons are coming out.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.400
Don't stop.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.600
Don't stop.

20:01.200 --> 20:05.560
Run, run now. Run now. Run now! Hurry!

20:06.840 --> 20:08.080
"Come on, out!"

20:08.520 --> 20:10.200
Ángel is running in.
Something’s gone wrong.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.440
Cancel! They've changed their face masks.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.920
They're not wearing the Dali ones.
They're going straight to their slaughter.

20:18.040 --> 20:18.920
What?

20:21.480 --> 20:23.760
Listen up, do not go in.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.520
Suárez, do you read me?

20:30.920 --> 20:32.360
Target reached.

20:32.920 --> 20:35.200
We're proceeding to remove the flap
and we'll be in.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.240
What are you doing?

20:42.800 --> 20:43.720
A bullet.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.480
A bullet wound.

20:55.960 --> 20:59.840
Gosh! Gosh! Gosh, Moscow!
It’s a real bloodbath!

20:59.920 --> 21:03.040
-Move away, let me do it!
-"Then something unexpected happened.

21:03.560 --> 21:07.800
Nairobi did her best and used
her meticulousness for the greater good.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.080
Instead of telling on them,
she helped Moscow save Mónica's life."

21:12.160 --> 21:13.640
I'm going to get some fresh air.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.480
-"Or at least her leg."
-For fuck's sake!

21:16.560 --> 21:18.600
"She really hadn't come to kill anyone."

21:18.680 --> 21:20.880
-Damn, come on!
-"And as I told you before,

21:21.400 --> 21:24.720
she wasn't going to let anything
screw the Professor's plan up."

21:27.040 --> 21:28.440
Suárez, do you read me?

21:29.680 --> 21:30.960
They have changed the face masks.

21:32.360 --> 21:35.320
There are some interferences. Command
post, do you copy me? I can't hear you.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.280
They're not wearing the Dali face masks!
It's a fucking suicide.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.760
Do not go in, I repeat, do not go in!

21:45.000 --> 21:46.120
"It's an order!"

21:46.240 --> 21:49.240
"They have changed their masks.
They're not wearing the Dali face masks.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.520
Attention, do you read me?

21:51.680 --> 21:53.120
"Do not go in!"

21:53.680 --> 21:55.400
-"We're cancelling the operation."
-Damn!

21:56.120 --> 21:57.320
We're cancelling the operation.

22:10.680 --> 22:12.880
Berlin, everyone can relax now.

22:13.240 --> 22:16.080
Plan B has worked as planned.
They're withdrawing.

22:18.760 --> 22:21.760
"Hidden behind a metallic voice
with their cameras and their strategy

22:21.840 --> 22:25.320
negotiating a robbery,
the Professor was in his element."

22:25.440 --> 22:28.480
At the rest of things in life
he was completely useless.

22:29.080 --> 22:32.440
Both so different
like Clark Kent and Superman.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.920
Perhaps because he had spent
his childhood and youth

22:36.000 --> 22:38.800
lying on a bed at San Juan de Dios
hospital of San Sebastián

22:39.480 --> 22:43.120
talking just with senior nurses
and reading books.

22:45.800 --> 22:48.360
He was neither a ordinary
nor a very sociable fellow.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.720
And not the least the seducer type."

22:51.080 --> 22:52.160
Can I sit down?

22:54.360 --> 22:55.240
Yes, sure.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.760
"So I loved making him feel nervous."

23:00.880 --> 23:03.160
So, when you're not planning a heist,
what do you do?

23:05.160 --> 23:07.160
You mean in my spare time
or something like that?

23:07.720 --> 23:08.800
Do you go dancing or...?

23:08.880 --> 23:11.640
No, no, not at all. I don't have
the slightest sense of rhythm.

23:13.520 --> 23:14.600
Have you got a girlfriend?

23:15.800 --> 23:16.800
Married?

23:18.400 --> 23:20.640
We agreed on no personal information.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.760
You're not a virgin, are you?

23:26.280 --> 23:27.920
I've been in some relationships.

23:29.640 --> 23:30.600
Several.

23:32.200 --> 23:35.000
Not a whole lot and they didn't last long,
but I've had a few.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.640
Relationships... I mean...

23:37.440 --> 23:38.640
sporadic relations.

23:39.160 --> 23:41.520
Sporadic ones, I don't mean
with prostitutes, don't misunderstand me.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.640
Well, I don't know, you may be gay.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.160
For God's sake... No.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.160
No, it just hasn't happened.

23:49.240 --> 23:51.400
I'm not inside any closet
or anything of that sort.

24:03.520 --> 24:05.560
People find a lot of things sexy.

24:06.160 --> 24:09.520
Dancing, muscles, fair hair,

24:09.800 --> 24:10.960
a French accent...

24:13.160 --> 24:14.840
Do you know what I find sexy?

24:19.360 --> 24:20.440
Intelligence.

24:22.600 --> 24:24.960
Men who speak to you
and you can't help admiring them.

24:25.040 --> 24:27.440
It doesn't matter whether they are tall,
short, ugly, good-looking...

24:27.520 --> 24:30.320
It turns me on that they talk to me
about things I don't know.

24:35.520 --> 24:38.240
Well, it's a peculiarity,
it's registered in dictionaries,

24:38.320 --> 24:39.840
it's called sapiophilia.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.360
You know everything, don't you?

24:50.960 --> 24:53.320
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to see the blast off.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.040
One thing.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.600
How did you come up
with the idea of this heist?

25:04.680 --> 25:06.080
It wasn't me who had the idea.

25:07.600 --> 25:08.600
And who did?

25:08.760 --> 25:10.400
It wasn't me.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.440
That sapiophilia thing
sounds to me like fucking a toad.

25:41.440 --> 25:44.280
-Who the fuck were those face masks of?
-I don't know.

25:44.880 --> 25:47.760
Their mouth was open kind of,
as in distress.

25:48.120 --> 25:51.680
Like, I can't say,
"The Scream" from Munch. That one.

25:52.280 --> 25:55.440
Munch, the Expressionist painter!

26:06.520 --> 26:09.600
Dali, Munch... Which will be the next one?

26:09.960 --> 26:13.080
You don't know how happy it makes me
that you ask that question, inspector.

26:14.760 --> 26:17.400
If you had to change it,
which painter would you choose?

26:17.560 --> 26:20.080
Sorry... I don't know, Picasso, perhaps?

26:20.840 --> 26:22.680
-Goya.
-Goya.

26:26.080 --> 26:27.000
Velázquez.

26:27.400 --> 26:28.280
Velázquez...

26:32.800 --> 26:34.920
Da Vinci. Yes, with a beard.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.120
-I like it, a beard.
-Andy Warhol.

26:39.440 --> 26:42.520
-The soup guy?
-Andy Warhol? Ángel.

26:43.160 --> 26:46.000
Yes, Andy Warhol,
the one who painted Marilyn.

26:47.160 --> 26:48.120
He's a painter...

26:49.480 --> 26:51.960
a very well-known, iconic painter.

26:53.640 --> 26:55.320
The hair and the glasses.

26:55.640 --> 26:58.120
Ángel, you're full of surprises.

26:58.280 --> 27:00.960
Full of surprises
with a microphone in your glasses.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.920
They could change the face masks every day
for a month

27:04.040 --> 27:06.200
and we wouldn't be able
to ever be ahead of them.

27:06.280 --> 27:10.040
But that's not the crux of the matter,
inspector, and you know it.

27:10.240 --> 27:12.240
"But that's not important, otherwise..."

27:12.400 --> 27:14.560
How the fuck did they know
we were inside?

27:15.360 --> 27:19.280
How long did they spend studying
all our next steps each second?

27:19.760 --> 27:21.720
If I'm honest with you, half of my life.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.080
How long do they expect
to be inside there?

27:24.240 --> 27:27.080
Not long, only 9 more days.
10, 11 the longest.

27:27.160 --> 27:29.680
We're playing a fucking game of chess,

27:29.840 --> 27:30.880
"and they're beating us."

27:30.960 --> 27:34.560
But I have a Trojan horse, inspector.
You have little chance to beat me.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.680
It's time to think carefully...

27:37.840 --> 27:38.960
look back,

27:40.240 --> 27:41.440
go back to the starting point.

27:49.360 --> 27:51.240
We all know this started long time ago.

27:51.520 --> 27:54.160
We know that those who were inside
had been there before.

27:54.240 --> 27:57.280
We have footage of Cortés
and Oliveira entering the museum.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.080
"But did they enter alone?

27:59.600 --> 28:01.920
Was it the first time or the last one?

28:02.760 --> 28:04.360
How many times did they visit it?"

28:04.720 --> 28:07.320
Did they speak to anyone?
A sign, a look...

28:07.840 --> 28:11.160
and, more important, did they
leave any fucking string to pull?

28:12.600 --> 28:15.760
"I want you to go through
the CCTV footage again

28:15.840 --> 28:18.200
and check them second by second."

28:18.360 --> 28:20.440
The rest of us will try to rest.

28:20.760 --> 28:23.200
Some of you haven't slept
for over 30 hours.

28:23.440 --> 28:26.160
Suárez, give me a call
if anything happens.

28:26.240 --> 28:27.320
You're in command.

28:28.560 --> 28:31.080
"Affray in Marcelo Usera, any unit near?"

28:31.160 --> 28:32.120
Please,

28:32.520 --> 28:35.360
leave channel eight free
for the hostages crisis!

28:36.680 --> 28:38.920
"No one uses channel eight, thank you!"

28:39.520 --> 28:42.600
Listen, Raquel.
Fancy a bite before going home?

28:42.960 --> 28:46.040
Between eating and sleeping,
I'd choose the former, but...

28:46.320 --> 28:47.480
I'm worn out, Ángel.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.200
I’m sorry, thanks.

28:51.600 --> 28:54.760
"Have you ever thought
that if you could go back in time

28:54.840 --> 28:56.680
you probably wouldn't make
the same decisions?

28:57.120 --> 29:00.760
And that we all make our own snowballs
with our bad decisions,

29:01.240 --> 29:05.200
snowballs that get bigger and bigger,
like the rock in Indiana Jones,

29:05.800 --> 29:08.680
and slide down after you to squash you.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.640
All the decisions we made in the past

29:31.160 --> 29:33.560
they take us inexorably to our future.

29:34.400 --> 29:37.720
Rio was going to realize
that as soon as he switched on

29:37.800 --> 29:40.320
the only television set
there was left in the factory,

29:41.440 --> 29:44.480
in case at any point we lost
communication with the professor."

29:45.680 --> 29:48.240
Turn it on, kid!
Turn it on, see what they say about us.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.080
This, bigger
than Glasgow Great train robbery!

29:50.160 --> 29:53.520
"A yet unknown number
of robbers gained access...

29:53.600 --> 29:55.760
What do the robbers want?"

29:55.880 --> 29:57.520
This is a big one!

29:58.120 --> 30:00.680
"Do they want to hit the system?"

30:03.240 --> 30:05.760
My goodness!
Not even the Americans could have done it!

30:05.840 --> 30:08.840
This is made in Spain but with M-16!
Beat it!

30:09.640 --> 30:10.680
Gosh, my parents!

30:11.040 --> 30:13.760
"An adolescent... a bit of a weirdo...

30:14.680 --> 30:16.160
"Shy...
-Shy.

30:17.160 --> 30:19.560
Our son was always locked in his room,

30:20.240 --> 30:22.320
but we thought he was
playing computer games or...

30:22.840 --> 30:24.840
But one never thinks
that he is a criminal.

30:26.600 --> 30:29.800
And then... you see him on TV
with a rifle, shooting,

30:30.120 --> 30:31.840
with 60 people all locked up.

30:33.800 --> 30:36.960
-And you see he's like those jihadists.
-Paco...

30:37.920 --> 30:39.720
He isn't our son anymore.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.000
Please, don't say that.

30:42.360 --> 30:45.280
For me... For me it's like he was dead.

30:45.600 --> 30:46.800
But, Paco...

30:47.280 --> 30:51.200
We have just heard the words
of one of the parents, heartbroken..."

30:53.440 --> 30:56.360
The professor said no news from outside.

30:57.840 --> 31:01.920
"But he had also said
he wanted a robbery with no violence,

31:02.600 --> 31:03.720
with no victims."

31:54.680 --> 31:55.560
Ángel, yes.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.040
"Hello, Raquel.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.160
Were you sleeping?"

31:59.920 --> 32:01.480
No, no, no, what's the matter?

32:01.960 --> 32:04.840
No, no, no, no. Nothing, relax.

32:06.760 --> 32:10.520
Look, I’ve been thinking.
Have you got a minute?

32:10.600 --> 32:12.600
Give her a rest, man,
she must be worn out.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.120
Yes, sure, yes.

32:14.200 --> 32:18.080
Sorry to be so direct:
what was all that about Andy Warhol?

32:19.440 --> 32:21.440
-Sorry?
-"That, about being full of surprises."

32:21.840 --> 32:25.800
What's wrong with me, I'm not supposed
to like museums or modern painters?

32:26.560 --> 32:28.640
I'm not supposed
to like something other than the Atleti?

32:28.960 --> 32:30.440
Yes, of course you are.

32:30.680 --> 32:33.800
It took me by... surprise,
because I didn't know.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.240
"The same way I didn't know
you were an Atleti supporter".

32:36.320 --> 32:38.280
-But it suits me, doesn't it?
-Yes, it does.

32:38.800 --> 32:39.680
Yes, it does.

32:40.280 --> 32:43.640
Listen, Ángel, I'm really tired.
Can we speak tomorrow?

32:45.000 --> 32:47.920
The guy I saw you with,
you were holding hands.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.040
Would you sleep with him?

32:52.840 --> 32:56.480
-"Tell me, I want to know."
-Ángel, what's all this about now?

32:56.560 --> 32:58.640
Would you sleep with him, yes or no?

32:59.760 --> 33:00.760
Answer me.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.480
Well, yes, I would, why not?

33:06.360 --> 33:08.240
"I'm a free, 40 year-old woman,"

33:08.520 --> 33:10.920
and the truth is
that I could do with a good bang,

33:11.720 --> 33:14.840
to... have something different
to think about.

33:15.440 --> 33:17.120
So I surely would.

33:18.200 --> 33:19.080
And, so what?

33:22.640 --> 33:23.640
I understand.

33:24.840 --> 33:27.480
You would give anyone a chance.
I understand.

33:28.840 --> 33:29.720
Ángel...

33:31.000 --> 33:34.600
What happened between you and me
in Cercedilla was a fling.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.640
"Eight years have passed and, look,"

33:37.840 --> 33:39.840
I made a clean cut
because we're colleagues.

33:40.160 --> 33:42.800
-And friends, Raquel.
-And friends.

33:43.560 --> 33:45.680
-And you're married, Ángel.
-"I'm married."

33:46.400 --> 33:49.320
Because you said
it wouldn't work between colleagues.

33:49.480 --> 33:51.960
"Then you got married,
and on top of that with a colleague."

33:52.120 --> 33:55.080
And because you never see me like...
a winner, you always see me

33:55.160 --> 33:58.240
like the loser who is not...
supposed to like Andy Warhol.

33:58.520 --> 34:01.360
"But if for a moment
you would see me as a man,"

34:02.480 --> 34:05.520
I promise you it would take me
less than ten minutes to leave Carmen...

34:11.760 --> 34:16.360
Forgive me. Raquel, I’m sorry. Damn,
I don't know what I'm saying, anymore.

34:17.440 --> 34:20.200
"It's this... job,
which is driving us mad."

34:22.480 --> 34:25.080
Yes, yes, that's true, all of us.

34:26.080 --> 34:30.720
"Ángel, it's late. Go to bed, huh?
We'll talk tomorrow."

34:31.800 --> 34:34.520
-Good night, Raquel.
-"Good night."

35:02.440 --> 35:03.960
Who were you talking to?

35:05.000 --> 35:06.880
I can't believe you were spying on me.

35:06.960 --> 35:08.680
I couldn't help overhear the conversation.

35:08.760 --> 35:10.200
Go to sleep, it's late.

35:10.280 --> 35:12.160
Too late. Now, I can't sleep.

35:12.720 --> 35:15.240
Let's see, tell me, what's wrong now?

35:15.440 --> 35:16.640
-What?
-Two suitors.

35:16.720 --> 35:19.200
He's not a suitor,
it's Ángel, a colleague.

35:19.280 --> 35:21.680
Ah, I thought
you were making him feel jealous

35:21.760 --> 35:24.400
with the stranger in the bar,
the one from the beers.

35:25.120 --> 35:27.960
Please, mum, I wasn't making him jealous!

35:28.040 --> 35:30.000
And you... don't close any doors.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.720
And now that you're not married,
you can go around playing the field.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.640
-Ah, playing the field.
-Yes, playing the field.

35:34.720 --> 35:35.600
Of course.

35:36.160 --> 35:39.360
Kido, in the end love is...

35:40.320 --> 35:42.400
what makes us see life in a different way.

35:44.880 --> 35:47.400
And you lately just see
the dark side of everything.

35:51.720 --> 35:55.080
It may mean that
you haven't got over... all this.

35:55.160 --> 35:58.120
Let's see, mum, let's see,
what haven't I got over, eh?

35:58.600 --> 36:01.280
You also think I pressed false charges...

36:01.920 --> 36:05.000
and I'm bitter because my ex
got involved with my sister

36:05.080 --> 36:06.320
and I want to screw them?

36:06.480 --> 36:08.920
Your husband
got involved with your sister?

36:11.640 --> 36:13.160
Mum, what are you saying?

36:17.640 --> 36:19.840
-What?
-Nothing. Yes...

36:20.080 --> 36:21.720
I just wanted to play it down.

36:22.720 --> 36:25.440
In the end that man
has hooked up with two sisters

36:25.600 --> 36:28.360
like in the films... those erotic ones.

36:30.320 --> 36:32.520
Mum. Mum, are you okay?

36:38.640 --> 36:40.680
How are you getting on with the heist,
darling?

36:41.560 --> 36:44.640
Sorry... Not well, not well. not well.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.360
There, sitting all day,

36:48.440 --> 36:50.640
in a stagnant situation, and... Yes.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.760
But you sitting, my darling?

36:53.080 --> 36:55.480
What you have to do is to chase.

36:55.880 --> 36:59.440
You only catch bad people when
you chase them. As if you didn't know.

37:06.080 --> 37:07.400
Good night, darling.

37:50.520 --> 37:52.000
What a nice surprise!

38:04.400 --> 38:05.800
You should come around more often.

38:10.280 --> 38:12.280
I can see you have
a very cute little office.

38:12.680 --> 38:14.720
-You already have two.
-I like offices.

38:15.920 --> 38:16.920
I have always...

38:18.400 --> 38:21.080
wanted to have one with a mahogany desk,

38:23.360 --> 38:26.000
but crime and offices
don't get along.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.080
It's so hot, isn't it?

38:34.680 --> 38:37.560
I can see you're wearing
your bullet proof vest to come to see me.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.800
I'd have preferred a bustier,
one of those Venetian ones.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.160
You see?

38:46.560 --> 38:48.120
I can't quite make you out.

38:48.760 --> 38:49.960
Why did you come, Tokyo?

38:54.680 --> 38:55.600
To ask you

38:59.640 --> 39:00.640
please

39:03.120 --> 39:04.680
to phone the professor

39:05.800 --> 39:07.400
and tell him what you did,

39:08.360 --> 39:10.360
that you order the execution of a hostage.

39:12.560 --> 39:13.920
Naughty boy.

39:20.240 --> 39:21.680
Because you know what?

39:24.240 --> 39:26.120
The professor is my guardian angel,

39:27.000 --> 39:29.720
and if you don't tell him,
I'll have to do it.

39:29.800 --> 39:30.680
You?

39:32.560 --> 39:33.920
And you'll be a tattletale.

39:34.720 --> 39:37.240
a snitch, a filthy rat.

39:39.040 --> 39:41.520
I'm a gentleman,
I wouldn't allow that to happen.

40:20.960 --> 40:21.840
Yes.

40:22.440 --> 40:24.120
I violated the first rule of the plan.

40:27.600 --> 40:28.920
I’ve killed a hostage.

40:30.880 --> 40:35.440
"Well not exactly me, Denver has,
but that's not important."

40:35.840 --> 40:38.520
Let's say he did it strictly
following my orders.

40:40.040 --> 40:42.160
I preferred to tell you myself.

40:54.040 --> 40:55.680
It was the only red line.

40:58.680 --> 41:00.080
You've screwed everything up.

41:02.560 --> 41:06.120
-I understand your shock.
-"You've screwed everything up."

41:06.760 --> 41:09.320
That woman had a mobile phone
between her legs.

41:10.800 --> 41:14.600
She might have wanted to use it
to phone her cousin Chelito...

41:15.280 --> 41:17.440
and tell her she was shagging the CEO,

41:17.520 --> 41:20.600
but I actually think
she wanted to phone the police.

41:24.920 --> 41:28.600
No more phones in the future.
You can be sure of that.

41:28.680 --> 41:29.600
Who was she?

41:31.280 --> 41:32.880
Mónica Gaztambide.

41:44.560 --> 41:45.760
"Will you punish me?"

41:47.920 --> 41:49.280
You should.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.360
"I know you're an idealist,

41:53.040 --> 41:56.240
that you think they will give us
the banknotes when we say please,"

41:56.400 --> 41:59.440
that you want to be a decent guy,
while you give us guns and explosives

41:59.520 --> 42:02.560
to blow this building up,
but no more games.

42:03.760 --> 42:05.240
You'll have to punish me,

42:05.800 --> 42:08.360
"because if you don't have the guts,
we won't succeed."

42:08.880 --> 42:11.480
I've told you on and on
over the past years:

42:14.200 --> 42:17.240
it's not me who has a problem, it's you.

42:19.240 --> 42:22.720
"You have to punish me because
that way I'll know you are a real captain"

42:22.880 --> 42:24.880
who is at the helm with no doubt,

42:25.880 --> 42:28.280
that you're dependable.

42:31.240 --> 42:33.480
"It seems you don't want
to talk about it now.

42:34.440 --> 42:36.960
For the time being, nobody
outside knows about this demise,

42:37.040 --> 42:38.800
so the plan is on."

42:39.160 --> 42:41.800
They'll ask for proofs of life
in less than 48 hours.
