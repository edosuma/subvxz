19:01.740 --> 19:04.109
- Off to save some lives!

19:04.176 --> 19:05.978
- Bobby, the pool closed
in September!

19:06.044 --> 19:08.046
You're delivering pizzas
tonight.

19:11.850 --> 19:12.985
- You know what, Rochelle?

19:13.051 --> 19:15.687
I think I had your mom
all wrong.

19:15.754 --> 19:17.890
Why don't you stay here tonight?

19:19.391 --> 19:20.459
[grunts]

19:20.526 --> 19:22.561
- Toby!

19:22.628 --> 19:24.096
Uh, why is he bouncing?

19:24.162 --> 19:28.567
{\an1}- Uh, because he's
a bouncing baby boy?

19:28.634 --> 19:31.169
- Wait. What's this?

19:31.236 --> 19:32.971
Lincoln, what's going on here?

19:33.038 --> 19:35.941
{\an1}- I can explain.
See, I gave you a fake egg.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.410
- Why would you do that?
- Because you're, well,

19:38.477 --> 19:41.313
Ronnie Anne.
- What's that supposed to mean?

19:41.380 --> 19:43.482
{\an3}- Well, I thought you couldn't
be trusted with the real one

19:43.549 --> 19:45.684
{\an3}because you're not exactly
the most careful

19:45.751 --> 19:47.085
and nurturing type, but--

19:47.152 --> 19:48.820
{\an1}- So that's
what you think of me?

19:48.887 --> 19:52.224
{\an1}That I'm such a monster that I
can't be left alone with an egg?

19:52.291 --> 19:54.860
- No, no, no. When I saw you
with your family,

19:54.927 --> 19:56.995
I realized I had you all wrong,
and--oof!

19:57.062 --> 19:58.964
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

19:59.031 --> 20:00.766
[smashes]
[Lincoln gasps]

20:00.832 --> 20:02.768
{\an1}- I guess none of that matters
anymore.

20:02.834 --> 20:05.404
Thanks a lot, Lincoln.
Now we're gonna fail.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.439
- Ronnie Anne, I--I--

20:07.506 --> 20:09.241
- Just get out of my house!

20:11.777 --> 20:13.412
{\an3}- Hey Lincoln,
Penelope and I wanted

20:13.478 --> 20:15.213
{\an3}to arrange a play date
for our eggs.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.816
{\an3}- It's important to socialize
at an early age.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.919
- Well, I'm afraid Rochelle is--

20:20.986 --> 20:22.654
[whistles, makes cracking sound]

20:22.721 --> 20:24.022
[both gasp]

20:24.089 --> 20:26.425
- Lincoln, please!
- I'm sorry, buddy.

20:26.491 --> 20:28.594
{\an3}I'm sure it wasn't easy
working with Ronnie Anne.

20:28.660 --> 20:33.065
- Actually, I think it wasn't
easy for her to work with me.

20:33.131 --> 20:35.334
That gives me an idea!
Got to run!

20:35.400 --> 20:37.202
- I know he's your best friend,
Clyde,

20:37.269 --> 20:40.305
but I don't want him
as Calliope's godfather.

20:42.941 --> 20:44.409
[doorbell rings]

20:48.113 --> 20:49.681
- "Please take care of me."

20:49.748 --> 20:52.184
Signed "Toby Rochelle II."

20:52.250 --> 20:54.753
I know you're there, weirdo.

20:54.820 --> 20:57.122
- Oh, uh, hi.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.424
- What's with the egg?
We're done. We failed.

20:59.491 --> 21:01.760
{\an3}- Well, after I left your house
yesterday,

21:01.827 --> 21:03.695
I went to talk to Mrs. Johnson.

21:03.762 --> 21:06.031
So it was my fault
the egg broke.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.599
I thought I knew
who Ronnie Anne was,

21:07.666 --> 21:10.235
but it turns out I didn't know
anything about her.

21:10.302 --> 21:12.137
She's really responsible
and caring,

21:12.204 --> 21:14.272
and she deserves
a second chance.

21:16.241 --> 21:18.910
{\an1}- All right, Lincoln.
I'll give her another shot.

21:18.977 --> 21:21.013
{\an3}- That's awesome!
Thanks, Mrs. Johnson.

21:21.079 --> 21:23.749
- And you, too.
- Really?

21:23.815 --> 21:25.684
- I think you just figured out

21:25.751 --> 21:28.954
{\an1}what this assignment is
all about.

21:29.021 --> 21:31.189
{\an3}- She didn't let me off the hook
completely.

21:31.256 --> 21:32.691
{\an3}I don't get
the waffle breakfast,

21:32.758 --> 21:35.360
{\an3}but that's okay,
because all I care about now is

21:35.427 --> 21:37.162
{\an3}putting our family
back together.

21:37.229 --> 21:39.865
{\an1}- Thanks, Lincoln.
I appreciate it.

21:39.931 --> 21:42.167
But don't get too mushy on me.

21:42.234 --> 21:43.969
Hey, I can make you waffles.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.171
{\an1}Bobby and I were
just about to have breakfast.

21:48.173 --> 21:49.274
- Hey, little Loud.

21:49.341 --> 21:50.375
- I'm glad you brought this,

21:50.442 --> 21:52.778
'cause I needed an extra egg.

21:52.844 --> 21:54.579
- Ronnie Anne, no!

[egg smashes]

21:56.248 --> 21:57.683
{\an1}Got you!
You're not the only one

21:57.749 --> 21:59.584
{\an1}who can pull an egg swap,
partner.

22:01.953 --> 22:03.422
