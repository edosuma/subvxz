00:24.692 --> 00:26.527
Yeah, about some things.
Not everything.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.429
I told you that if you didn't
get your books right,

00:28.462 --> 00:29.530
things were gonna change.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.165

I came across it a few days ago
but left it where I found it.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.596
Seein' if maybe you would
tell me what happened

04:22.630 --> 04:25.466
without me havin'
to step to you.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.600
But you didn't.

04:29.637 --> 04:32.006
I forgot I left it there.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.675
Based on that shirt,
looks like either you got shot,

04:34.708 --> 04:37.444
or someone standin'
real close to you did.

04:37.478 --> 04:40.280
But here you are,
up for breakfast.

04:40.314 --> 04:41.782
So I guess we should
just pour some out

04:41.815 --> 04:43.283
for the brother
who was next to you.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.021
You were there
with your Uncle Marvin.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.923
Yeah, stash house, Kanan.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.458
He told me what happened

04:51.492 --> 04:53.994
but somehow forgot to mention
that you were there.

04:54.028 --> 04:55.029
I wonder why.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.033
I was just goin' to get
some money Scrap owed me.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.602
<i>Saw Uncle Marvin there
loadin' up his car.</i>

05:01.635 --> 05:02.970
He said he ain't need help,

05:03.003 --> 05:04.872
but I wasn't gon'
let him do that alone.

05:05.539 --> 05:08.409
Right. Because you like that.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.744
You always wantin'
to lend a helpin' hand.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.680
Like when I ask you to help me

05:12.713 --> 05:14.548
with the dishes
every damn night

05:14.581 --> 05:15.783
and you don't do shit.

05:17.051 --> 05:18.352
Ma, I'm tellin' the truth.

05:18.385 --> 05:19.386
You're not.

05:20.554 --> 05:21.955
But I'm not about
to get into it with you,

05:21.989 --> 05:24.058
because I'm not even sure what
I wanna say to you right now.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.827
Don't even know where to start.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.062
Just sit down and eat.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.574
I told you to stay away
from that stash house.

05:40.607 --> 05:42.109
<i>I couldn't have been clearer.</i>

05:42.342 --> 05:43.544
I said you were done.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.501
Neighbors said that there was
some sort of car crash outside

06:07.534 --> 06:10.637
and they heard
multiple shots fired, but...

06:10.671 --> 06:12.840
no one saw anything.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.842
No one sees anything.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.810
And then bodies
start turnin' up.

06:21.448 --> 06:22.583
Looks like somebody
didn't have the stomach

06:22.616 --> 06:23.784
for whatever happened here.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.833
That ain't
original construction,

06:39.867 --> 06:42.102
that's for fuckin' sure.

06:42.136 --> 06:44.705
Can you say dope spot?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.006
Stash house?

06:46.039 --> 06:47.674
<i>Maybe a robbery?</i>

06:47.708 --> 06:48.909
Who the fuck knows?

06:48.942 --> 06:51.178
We ain't got a victim,
we ain't got a crime.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.780
Our work here is done.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.889
So you left out
some of them finer details

07:01.922 --> 07:04.024
when you told us about
the stash house gettin' hit.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.593
Yo, I mean...

07:09.429 --> 07:11.064
I did?

07:11.098 --> 07:12.733
I mean, shit happened fast,
you know.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.868
I mean, I- I was cappin'-cappin'
one nigga.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.170
Bow. Bow.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.739
Then another nigga this way.
Bow. Bow.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.542
Yo, I was like
a Black Rambo out there.

07:21.575 --> 07:24.011
I might have left out,
you know, some-some shit.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.445
But yo, you got the basics.

07:25.479 --> 07:26.847
No, my son was there, Marvin.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.549
Is Kanan not
a part of the basics?

07:36.824 --> 07:37.991
Raq--

07:38.025 --> 07:39.159
<i>I don't even wanna hear</i>

07:39.193 --> 07:40.794
your bullshit version
of what went down.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.196
I got all that from Kanan.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.997
<i>I been sittin' on this
for a few days,</i>

07:44.031 --> 07:46.633
just waitin' to see
if one of you would come clean.

07:46.667 --> 07:49.169
<i>It's a test
that both of you failed.</i>

07:49.203 --> 07:50.804
And he ain't snitch on you,
by the way.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.005
He took it all on himself.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.740
Boy's got heart.

07:53.774 --> 07:54.908
Too much heart.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.643
And too much trust
in his dumbass uncle.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.579
Look, what had happened was--

07:58.612 --> 08:00.147
Shut the fuck up.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.648
I just was--

08:01.682 --> 08:03.951
See, this is our older
brother's problem right here.

08:03.984 --> 08:04.952
He don't listen.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.987
So focused on tellin' a new lie

08:07.020 --> 08:08.121
to cover up the old lie

08:08.155 --> 08:09.523
<i>that he don't hear
what I'm sayin',</i>

08:09.556 --> 08:11.091
which is shut the fuck up.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.793
And I can't tell if it's 'cause

08:12.826 --> 08:14.161
he thinks
he knows better than me

08:14.194 --> 08:16.530
or that he just--he don't care
what I have to say.

08:16.563 --> 08:18.098
What you think, Lou?

08:18.131 --> 08:19.266
Can't call it, sis.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.768
<i>I said Kanan was on ice.</i>

08:21.802 --> 08:23.637
I said he was to be kept
away from the business.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.640
But you ain't hear me, though,
so my son almost got killed.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.175
<i>And we lost half our shit.</i>

08:28.208 --> 08:30.077
Even for you, that's a busy day
of fuckin' up, Marvin.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.712
I saved Kanan.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.614
You're missin' the point.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.582
But just like I told Kanan
this mornin',

08:35.616 --> 08:36.884
I don't have the time
or the energy

08:36.917 --> 08:38.952
to explain it to you right now,
so we movin' on.

08:41.255 --> 08:42.689
We about to go on offense.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.291
I wanna know what 'Nique's
doin' before he do it.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.893
I wanna get
in that nigga's head.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.295
We ain't goin' to war, but we
ain't layin' down, neither.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.666
What about that rat
we need to smoke out?

08:52.699 --> 08:54.868
Someone gave up the stash.
We need to find out who.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.536
<i>Could have been anybody.</i>

08:57.170 --> 08:59.172
We been posted up there
way too long anyway.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.774
Yeah, and it don't even matter.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.776
What matters is, we know
it was 'Nique that hit us.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.678
We handle that nigga,
we handle everything.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.548
And I'm on that, so don't
do nothin' else stupid.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.820
Remember we got that meetin'
over at Baisley later.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.222
And pick up all that shit.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.723
I'm gettin' too tired
of cleanin' up

09:16.757 --> 09:18.258
after your sloppy ass.

09:24.631 --> 09:26.833
This nigga.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.902
Had Kanan up in the stash house

09:28.936 --> 09:30.237
with a gun to his head.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.573
Damn, nigga.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.977
You just can't help
but fuck up, can you?

09:43.583 --> 09:46.086
<i>Projects are due
a week from Monday.</i>

09:46.119 --> 09:47.921
So don't wait
till Sunday night to start.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.927
That attention to detail
says a lot about you, Kanan.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.228
You notice the little things.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.598
<i>Nothing gets past you.</i>

09:58.632 --> 09:59.733
<i>You care.</i>

09:59.766 --> 10:00.968
That's gonna serve you well

10:01.001 --> 10:03.070
in everything you do
for the rest of your life.

10:05.339 --> 10:08.041
It's actually kind of cool.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.843
I mean,
this whole class has been--

10:09.876 --> 10:11.678
Boring?

10:11.712 --> 10:14.181
Wasn't as bad as I thought.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.383
Well, that means something,
coming from you.

10:18.685 --> 10:20.220
I can't lie.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.290
I gave my moms a hard time

10:23.323 --> 10:24.725
when she put me
in here with you.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.093
I heard.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.729
Especially this whole
Saturday school thing.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.130
Come on, man, it's wack,
and you know it.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.666
Learnin' don't take
weekends off, young brother.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.204
It's been cool, though.
For real.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.373
I appreciate that.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.811
Did you know that
that bridge was built

10:44.845 --> 10:46.947
so middle-class white folks
could get around us?

10:46.980 --> 10:48.982
<i>Here he go again.</i>

10:49.016 --> 10:51.385
<i>This nigga Symphony
never stop teachin'.</i>

10:51.418 --> 10:54.654
<i>Class was always in session
with this nigga.</i>

10:54.688 --> 10:57.657
<i>But on the real,
I liked it about him.</i>

10:57.691 --> 10:59.760
Black families were
movin' into Brooklyn,

10:59.793 --> 11:01.328
so the white people moved out.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.763
But they built them a bridge

11:02.796 --> 11:04.364
so they could still get
into the city.

11:04.398 --> 11:07.801
The Van Wyck Expressway near
you is the same damn thing.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.771
They put up that highway,
tore down whole neighborhoods,

11:10.804 --> 11:12.105
so people going to the airport

11:12.139 --> 11:14.041
could avoid drivin'
through the hood.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.309
Only time they stop
is to fill up they cars.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.677
Hmm.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.079
That's why the gas station
near the Van Wyck

11:19.112 --> 11:21.848
is packed with white folks
doin' the mad dash.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.283
Only time you ever
see them in the hood

11:23.316 --> 11:24.818
is when they fuelin' up.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.856
Racism is built
right into this city.

11:31.091 --> 11:34.194
It's been set up to keep us
right where they want us.

11:35.862 --> 11:36.863
It's like that.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.967
Look, I'm not tryin' to do
the whole

11:41.001 --> 11:43.303
"I wanna be your friend"
thing or anything like that,

11:43.336 --> 11:45.939
but if you ever need anything

11:45.972 --> 11:49.443
or just wanna kick it,

11:49.476 --> 11:50.911
I'm around, man.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.882
Hit me up anytime.

12:14.468 --> 12:16.203
You really like my mom.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.207
I do.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.978
That's cool.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.820
Rockin' all this secret shit.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.755
Fuck is Baisley about, anyway?

12:35.789 --> 12:37.224
Niggas spend they whole life
tryin' to get out the projects.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.925
She movin' us in.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.227
Marvin, you ever think
that maybe

12:40.260 --> 12:41.928
if you kept better secrets
back in the day,

12:41.962 --> 12:43.530
you wouldn't have done
that whole bid in Elmira?

12:43.763 --> 12:45.132
I got set up.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.534
No, you did it to yourself,
nigga, like you always do.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.102
And you doin'
the same shit here.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.437
Only it ain't just you anymore.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.272
It's all us, and I ain't dyin'

12:52.305 --> 12:54.174
or goin' to prison
over your stupid shit, nigga.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.942
You all on Raq's dick, nigga.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.410
Always steppin' and fetchin'.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.813
No, I handle my business.
You should try it sometime.

12:59.846 --> 13:01.882
Your business
ain't about shit, nigga.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.917
Fake-ass Quincy Jones
up in here.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.088
Yeah.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.824
I know all about you
and Crown Camacho.

13:10.857 --> 13:13.093
Heard Juke on the phone
talkin' to Famous.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.195
Sound to me like the only song
you gon' be singin'

13:15.228 --> 13:17.831
is "That Puerto Rock Record
Nigga Fucked My Bitch."

13:17.864 --> 13:19.466
Oh, but you got a song too,
Marvin.

13:19.499 --> 13:20.901
Only yours goes,

13:20.934 --> 13:24.037
"That New York Knick Nigga
Fucked My Baby Mama

13:24.070 --> 13:27.307
and Then Turned Her Out
to the Whole Goddamn League."

13:38.084 --> 13:39.452
What's up, nigga?
What's up?

13:40.387 --> 13:42.222
Get the fuck--

13:52.532 --> 13:54.301
Hey!

13:54.334 --> 13:58.305
Hey! Do not make us
get out of this car.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.042
Have a nice day, boys.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.514
You lucky five-oh
saved your ass, baby bro.

14:09.916 --> 14:12.419
You know what, Marvin?

14:12.452 --> 14:15.288
You ain't never been shit.

14:15.322 --> 14:17.023
Won't ever be shit.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.895
There go Lou.

14:23.330 --> 14:27.300
Gonna go nurse on...
nurse on his sister's titty.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.435
Hey, if I'm on the right,

14:28.468 --> 14:29.936
your bitch ass
is on the left, baby.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.073
Fuck you.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.041
<i>Shit.</i>

14:51.057 --> 14:53.326
You can't smoke in here,
Detective Howard.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.629
My fault.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.300
The hospital in Montgomery

15:00.333 --> 15:02.902
called with
your cousins' results.

15:02.936 --> 15:05.939
Neither is a good match
as a potential donor for you.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.375
Shit.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.943
They was gonna extort
the hell out of me

15:09.976 --> 15:11.411
for that shit anyway.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.614
Since you don't have
any other relatives,

15:14.648 --> 15:17.584
my office has contacted
the Bone Marrow Donor Registry.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.487
<i>But I don't want
to get your hopes up.</i>

15:20.520 --> 15:22.155
<i>It's a long shot.</i>

15:22.188 --> 15:24.691
<i>And even if we were
to identify a partial match,</i>

15:24.924 --> 15:26.359
we're still operating
on the fringes

15:26.393 --> 15:27.694
of medical science here.

15:28.662 --> 15:31.364
<i>But given the paucity
of choices we're facing,</i>

15:31.398 --> 15:33.166
<i>it's our best and only option.</i>

15:36.202 --> 15:38.405
<i>Lifestyle changes can often
make a big difference</i>

15:38.438 --> 15:41.708
<i>when it comes
to potential outcomes here.</i>

15:41.941 --> 15:45.645
<i>Certainly, smoking
is a bad idea.</i>

15:45.679 --> 15:49.582
<i>Shit. I'm a bad idea.</i>

15:49.616 --> 15:52.052
<i>But also,
modifications to your diet</i>

15:52.085 --> 15:54.054
<i>and a regular exercise regimen</i>

15:54.087 --> 15:56.323
<i>can help to improve
your prognosis.</i>

15:56.356 --> 15:59.192
<i>And there are holistic
and alternative treatments</i>

15:59.225 --> 16:01.728
<i>that, uh, have shown promise.</i>

16:01.961 --> 16:04.264
"Alternative treatments."

16:04.297 --> 16:06.099
So we throwin' Hail Marys now.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.469
am I on some

16:09.502 --> 16:11.438
get-my-affairs-in-order
type shit?

16:13.506 --> 16:17.243
If we can't find a good match
for you soon,

16:17.277 --> 16:19.512
we'll start to discuss
palliative care.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.695
Hello snow bunny.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.471
Hey. No reading.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.605
You read, you pay.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.076
Ay-yi-yi. <i>Sí, sí, sí, sí.</i>

16:52.278 --> 16:53.279
Put it back.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.051
Yo, when I blow up,

16:58.084 --> 16:59.686
this gonna be the worst
I do right here, yo.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.187
That's a nine for other niggas.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.789
This gonna be, like,
a- a three or four for me.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.791
This the bottom right here.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.326
These hos gonna know me.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.527
My name ain't Famous
for nothin'.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.562
-Yeah, it is.
-Fuck you know, Juke?

17:09.596 --> 17:10.697
I'm a girl.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.432
On the strength of that alone,

17:12.465 --> 17:14.134
I know more about girls
than you

17:14.167 --> 17:15.769
and any other nigga
you know combined.

17:15.802 --> 17:17.203
Your cousin talkin' shit
about us, Kanan.

17:18.271 --> 17:19.706
Wastin' my damn breath,
as usual.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.742
A'ight, then,
what you got, Juke?

17:22.776 --> 17:25.111
Hit us with some of that
girl wisdom of yours.

17:25.779 --> 17:28.314
I know what works
and what doesn't.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.150
I know what feels good.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.751
And I know how to make
somebody else feel good.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.188
Look, unlike you two suckers,

17:35.221 --> 17:36.623
I've actually been
with somebody.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.491
<i>What?</i>

17:38.525 --> 17:39.759
<i>Since when?</i>

17:39.793 --> 17:43.663
You out here like that?
Like-like, for real?

17:43.696 --> 17:45.331
What the fuck?
Who you been with?

17:45.365 --> 17:46.499
I been tryin' to hit them skins
since the fifth fuckin' grade.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.500
Hey.

17:47.534 --> 17:48.501
<i>You gonna let some
random-ass nigga hit?</i>

17:48.535 --> 17:49.602
I'm supposed to be your first.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.337
Uh, yeah,
that was never gonna happen.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.572
And you know that's my cousin

17:52.605 --> 17:54.641
you speakin' on right now,
right?

17:54.674 --> 17:56.376
-Show a little respect, nigga.
-No.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.777
I don't get no word
from either one of y'all.

17:57.811 --> 17:59.279
Especially you, K?

17:59.312 --> 18:00.580
<i>I gotta find out
about this shit</i>

18:00.613 --> 18:02.081
readin' over some random-ass
titties in <i>Playboy.</i>

18:02.115 --> 18:04.684
Yeah, I been busy gettin'
shot at and robbed and shit.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.719
So I'm the last nigga to know.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.257
Yeah. You are.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.626
Bullshit.

18:16.162 --> 18:19.299
Still no idea
who ratted out the spot, right?

18:19.332 --> 18:20.467
Got my suspicions.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.702
Yeah, me too.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.137
Who?

18:24.170 --> 18:25.872
Man, fuck all that.
Let's get back to Juke.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.106
Who hit?

18:28.508 --> 18:31.277
I know you might not
wanna hear this,

18:31.311 --> 18:34.347
but I can't help but think
maybe your girl had a hand.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.682
<i>Hold up. Davina?</i>

18:35.715 --> 18:36.850
You think Davina
gave up Raq's stash house?

18:36.883 --> 18:39.152
Famous, shut the fuck up.

18:39.185 --> 18:41.321
I'm sorry, Juke just said
Davina a fuckin' rat.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.225
Yo.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.161
You fuckin' said it.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.765
Davina ain't had nothin'
to do with that, man.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.335
She was with Buck,
she got connects to Unique,

18:55.368 --> 18:56.669
and you said she rolled
through the spot.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.805
Nigga, she ain't know
what the fuck it was.

18:58.838 --> 18:59.906
It ain't like
I invited her in there.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.641
Whatever, man. I'm just sayin'.

19:01.674 --> 19:05.678
Scrappy.
That's who gave that shit up.

19:05.712 --> 19:08.314
Nigga think I'm takin'
his fuckin' spot.

19:08.348 --> 19:10.149
He call in sick
the same day we get hit

19:10.183 --> 19:11.618
and he show up
with some new Jordans?

19:11.651 --> 19:13.920
He's a fuckin' rat.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.788
I'ma handle that fool, though.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.291
'Cause that's me.

19:18.324 --> 19:21.628
Scrappy one of the most loyal
soldiers your mom's got.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.763
He practically family.

19:25.398 --> 19:28.234
Family?

19:28.268 --> 19:30.303
What you know
about my family, Juke?

19:30.336 --> 19:33.273
I know your family's
my family, nigga.

19:33.306 --> 19:36.543
And there's shit about our
family that you don't know.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.311
Secrets you don't wanna know.

19:39.913 --> 19:41.514
I know your secrets, Juke.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.485
I suggest you watch
your fuckin' mouth.

19:50.256 --> 19:52.926
You think I'm fuckin' scared
of you, nigga?

19:52.959 --> 19:54.661
Yo, fuck you, Kanan.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.201
Yo, I--

20:02.235 --> 20:03.570
Where's she goin'?

20:05.772 --> 20:08.575
Don't know, don't care.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.577
Y'all beefin'. Got it.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.321
This is it.

20:23.423 --> 20:24.657
This is the spot.

20:24.691 --> 20:25.892
It's facin' the right way,

20:25.925 --> 20:29.529
so we can see the street
down below.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.297
We'll take this one
and the one underneath it.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.500
Like I said, though,
it's occupied.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.336
And the tenant's got, like,

20:36.369 --> 20:39.439
eight months left
on his lease, so...

20:39.472 --> 20:40.773
Figure that shit out, then.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.342
Figure what shit out?

20:46.379 --> 20:48.648
What the fuck y'all doin'
in my spot?

20:49.782 --> 20:51.351
Y'all must think
I'm some other nigga,

20:51.384 --> 20:53.319
'cause this Black man
ain't goin' nowhere.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.622
But y'all motherfuckers
need to get to steppin'.

20:55.655 --> 20:56.956
And who the fuck told you
you could just

20:56.990 --> 20:58.558
roll through here
without no heads-up, Darius?

20:58.591 --> 21:01.527
He do what we say,
just like you do.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.997
You must got me confused
with some other fool, son.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.632
I ain't goin' out like that.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.639
Yo, I'll tell you
how you goin' out.

21:16.542 --> 21:19.445
I ain't just tellin' you.
I'm showin' you, nigga.

21:25.318 --> 21:28.354
-Marvin.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.622
Go get some air.

21:30.757 --> 21:31.924
Take Darius with you.

21:42.568 --> 21:44.904
You know who I am, right?

21:44.937 --> 21:47.640
-I-I think so.
Mm.

21:50.643 --> 21:55.415
Then you know that one way
or the other, this...

21:55.448 --> 21:57.050
this apartment
is about to be mine.

21:58.484 --> 22:01.821
Only question left is how
you gon' end up in the deal.

22:11.497 --> 22:12.732
<i>Yo, Juke!</i>

22:12.765 --> 22:16.536
Yo, hold up. Damn.
You walk fast as shit.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.371
So who got there before I did?

22:18.404 --> 22:20.073
I can't do this with you
right now, Famous, okay?

22:20.106 --> 22:21.507
I-I need to be on my own shit.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.910
A'ight. Yo.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.945
I'm 'bout to go to the stu',
put some flows down.

22:25.978 --> 22:27.847
You wanna come through, see
what a real artist look like?

22:27.880 --> 22:29.749
Oh, so you a real artist now?

22:29.782 --> 22:31.918
Man, you know this.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.086
Maybe you could slide through,

22:33.119 --> 22:34.620
hop in the booth,
show 'em what you got.

22:34.654 --> 22:37.423
You know, there's-there's gon'
be a producer there.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.691
I know you wanna be down.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.560
Don't let this shit with Kanan
fuck it up.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.829
That shit gon' be squashed.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.065
Fuck it.

22:46.099 --> 22:47.467
Ain't like I got shit to do
anyway.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.136
You about to me
on my dick, girl.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.838
<i>-Yo, we out.</i>
-Whatever, man.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.478
We're gonna clean it out,
clean it up,

22:58.511 --> 22:59.812
and get to this remodel.

22:59.846 --> 23:02.682
Yo, uh, where homeboy
with the mouth at?

23:02.715 --> 23:04.784
Gettin' boxes
to pack his shit up.

23:04.817 --> 23:07.019
-You gon' help him move.
-Yo, fuck that.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.821
That motherfucker be talk--

23:12.058 --> 23:13.826
He better not say shit else.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.561
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

23:15.595 --> 23:17.697
You can't do
any construction in here

23:17.730 --> 23:19.966
without prior approval
from the building inspector.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.400
We gon' be a'ight.

23:21.434 --> 23:22.568
Look, I just need you
to make sure

23:22.602 --> 23:25.037
that we can get the unit
directly below this one.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.140
Now, go figure that shit out,
and I'll hit you up later.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.110
Bounce, motherfucker.

23:39.452 --> 23:43.422
Yo, so, um, when you and Kanan
movin' in here?

23:43.456 --> 23:45.925
Nigga, is you out
your fuckin' mind?

23:45.958 --> 23:48.060
You think that me and my son,
we movin' up in here?

23:49.028 --> 23:50.530
<i>Shit.</i>

23:50.563 --> 23:52.632
When I move,
you gon' be the last to know.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.736
Look, we bringin'
the business up in here.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.071
From up high like this,

23:59.105 --> 24:01.674
we can see 'em comin'
from a mile away.

24:01.707 --> 24:04.644
No more bum rushes
or tusslin' over corners

24:04.677 --> 24:07.513
or hidin' stash houses
or bodega bullshit.

24:07.547 --> 24:09.081
Out of sight, out of mind.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.917
Then why you need two?

24:12.618 --> 24:15.454
We gon' connect this unit
to the one below it.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.523
Put in a hidden drop
between 'em.

24:17.557 --> 24:20.059
So if the police,
somebody tries to fuck with us,

24:20.092 --> 24:22.195
we can just throw our shit
down the chute

24:22.228 --> 24:24.597
to the apartment below.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.732
Foolproof.

24:26.766 --> 24:29.902
While 'Nique out on the street,
fightin' for tired corners,

24:29.936 --> 24:31.804
we in the sky,
lookin' down on him

24:31.838 --> 24:34.040
and all the rest
of these motherfuckers.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.842
We 'bout to be
on the mountaintop.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.014
The mountaintop?

25:02.201 --> 25:03.569
I spoke to your uncle.

25:04.203 --> 25:06.505
<i>And I told him the same thing
that I told you.</i>

25:07.573 --> 25:08.741
Look, I don't wanna know
any more

25:08.774 --> 25:11.010
than what I already know
about what happened.

25:11.043 --> 25:14.513
But like I keep tellin' you,
I know shit that you don't.

25:14.547 --> 25:17.650
Come on, why everybody always
tellin' me what I don't know?

25:17.683 --> 25:19.285
You been playin' me, Ma.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.754
One day, I'm in.
Next day, I'm out.

25:21.787 --> 25:22.955
One day, I'm on the stash.

25:22.989 --> 25:25.658
Next day, I'm at after-school
with your man.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.927
You told me you was gonna
show me how this works.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.161
Teach me the game.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.630
Instead, you just been
playin' with my head.

25:30.663 --> 25:33.666
What you want, Kanan? Huh?

25:33.699 --> 25:35.001
And don't tell me
you want a corner,

25:35.034 --> 25:36.535
'cause that's not happenin'.

25:36.569 --> 25:38.237
Not anytime soon, that is.

25:38.271 --> 25:40.806
Look, nobody start off in this
shit bein' Tony Montana.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.808
All right, show me
how to cook, then.

25:42.842 --> 25:45.077
Cook? Cook what?

25:46.245 --> 25:47.914
What you think?

25:47.947 --> 25:50.182
I already know
spaghetti and meatballs.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.550
I wanna learn.

25:58.024 --> 25:59.592
Damn, Kanan.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.195
You my son, that's for sure.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.598
You know what you want,
and you want it now,

26:05.631 --> 26:07.033
and you not gon' wait
on nobody.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.801
Nope. Not even you.

26:11.671 --> 26:12.905
I gotta think about this.

26:12.939 --> 26:14.140
<i>Think about it, Ma.</i>

26:14.173 --> 26:16.108
But I'm done gettin' played.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.745
When I pulled up just now,
I saw you fly into the house

26:19.779 --> 26:20.947
like the police
was chasin' you.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.182
What's goin' on?

26:23.215 --> 26:25.217
I was just gettin' quarters
for Gerardi's.

26:26.986 --> 26:30.056
-I'ma drop you off.
-A'ight.

27:23.075 --> 27:25.077
Uh-oh.

27:25.111 --> 27:26.679
What's lil' man up to?

27:27.880 --> 27:30.116
<i>I thought we were
tailin' Raquel.</i>

27:30.149 --> 27:32.385
You said she might connect back
to that stash house situation.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.420
First off,
that kid right there,

27:34.653 --> 27:36.255
<i>he was friends with D-Wiz.</i>

27:36.288 --> 27:37.857
<i>Went to high school
with Buck Twenty.</i>

27:37.890 --> 27:39.658
And his mom's a known
drug trafficker.

27:39.692 --> 27:42.028
He's got links to every
cold case we got goin' on.

27:42.061 --> 27:44.196
And at the same time,

27:44.230 --> 27:46.766
lil' motherfucker comes
from hustlin' royalty.

27:46.799 --> 27:50.336
His father--
Rondell "Def Con" Stark,

27:50.369 --> 27:53.039
whose face belongs on
the Mount Rushmore of kingpins,

27:53.072 --> 27:56.175
right next to Nicky Barnes
and Frank Lucas.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.977
Kanan Stark's
the motherfuckin' prince

27:58.010 --> 28:00.246
of the Southside.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.348
And sometimes when you wanna
get to the queen...

28:02.381 --> 28:04.884
You gotta go through
the prince.

28:08.454 --> 28:10.689
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, let's get it.

28:10.723 --> 28:12.124
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

28:12.158 --> 28:14.727
<i>Money, money, money, let's go.</i>

28:14.760 --> 28:16.195
Get that money. Get that money.

28:16.228 --> 28:17.830
Come on, boy.

28:17.863 --> 28:19.031
<i>Ooh!</i>

28:19.065 --> 28:20.399
Thought you were sick.

28:20.433 --> 28:22.835
Why you thinkin' 'bout me
at all, nigga?

28:22.868 --> 28:24.203
'Bout to take all
these suckers' money.

28:24.236 --> 28:25.271
<i>Let's go, man.</i>

28:25.304 --> 28:27.073
Hey, you heard about
what happened?

28:27.106 --> 28:29.041
Don't you got errands
to run for your mama?

28:29.075 --> 28:31.210
Go pick up that quart of milk

28:31.243 --> 28:34.013
and a pack of Kools
on the corner, nigga.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.750
I need to talk to you.

28:37.783 --> 28:40.119
You out your fuckin' mind,
puttin' hands on me.

28:40.152 --> 28:42.988
Stash house didn't get hit
by itself, Scrap.

28:43.022 --> 28:44.723
Somebody inside
the crew been talkin'.

28:44.757 --> 28:47.026
Your ass wasn't there
the day we got hit.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.727
I wonder why.

28:48.761 --> 28:51.464
I swear, if you wasn't
Raq's kid,

28:51.497 --> 28:53.365
I'd fuck you up right now
for even thinkin'

28:53.399 --> 28:54.967
about thinkin' that bullshit.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.104
I ain't no snake-ass nigga.

28:58.137 --> 29:00.072
Your moms know that
better than anyone.

29:02.374 --> 29:04.276
If this was comin' from Raq,

29:04.310 --> 29:06.112
I'd be tore up already.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.514
So I know she ain't
put your punk ass on me.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.217
Nigga, this ain't got
nothin' to do with Raq.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.319
I got my own eyes and ears.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.354
You need to get
to your after-school class

29:15.387 --> 29:17.490
or homeroom or whatever, nigga,

29:17.523 --> 29:20.860
'cause you a boy playin'
in a man's world right now.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.094
-Word?
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:22.128 --> 29:23.429
-Word?
-Come on.

29:23.462 --> 29:24.463
Let's go, boy.
I been waitin' for you.

29:24.497 --> 29:25.965
You know that, right? Yeah.

29:25.998 --> 29:27.933
What's up now? Oh.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.869
Yeah, they call me Slappy.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.105
Yeah. Huh?

29:35.508 --> 29:36.942
Get your ass up.
Let's go.

29:36.976 --> 29:38.444
Let 'em wear themselves out
for a minute.

29:38.477 --> 29:39.879
Let's go. Uh-huh.

29:39.912 --> 29:42.381
Burn off

Damn, you bleedin', son.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.650
Mouth bleedin'.

31:24.883 --> 31:25.918
Clean yourself up.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.668

supposed to do with that?

31:44.670 --> 31:46.171

32:03.055 --> 32:05.324
I'm waitin' for my people.

32:05.357 --> 32:07.493
I'm excited to see your moms.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.628
Raq love me. She always has.

32:09.662 --> 32:13.365
We go way back.
She ain't tell you about us?

32:13.399 --> 32:15.567
Nah, we don't talk
about police.

32:16.602 --> 32:19.438
Look, I wasn't plannin'
on chargin' you.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.340
I could, but I'm not.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.275
But if you make this harder
than it needs to be,

32:23.309 --> 32:25.411
I'ma take you to a place
you don't wanna go.

32:32.017 --> 32:35.688
August 15, 1975.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.361
Thought you was older.

32:42.394 --> 32:43.495
And why you care?

32:53.572 --> 32:56.008
I'm here for Kanan.
He called me to pick him up.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.376
You okay?

32:57.409 --> 33:00.446
And who are you exactly?

33:00.479 --> 33:01.980
Family friend.

33:02.014 --> 33:05.150
Well, family friend is not
a legal guardian, brother.

33:06.652 --> 33:08.987
Police grabbin' up Black boys
off the street for nothin'

33:09.021 --> 33:10.589
but the melanin in their skin

33:10.622 --> 33:13.325
isn't exactly legal either...
brother.

33:15.728 --> 33:18.464
We got us another nigga
with a law degree

33:18.497 --> 33:20.265

University.

33:20.299 --> 33:23.736
I ain't a nigga, Officer.

33:23.769 --> 33:25.237
Somebody got
their feelings hurt.

33:25.270 --> 33:27.272
Apologies, brother.

33:27.306 --> 33:28.774
I ain't your brother, neither.

35:29.495 --> 35:30.529
<i>We talked about this.</i>

35:30.562 --> 35:31.563
Let me get through
the showcase.

35:31.597 --> 35:32.865
Oh, now it's the showcase.

35:32.898 --> 35:35.868
Because before,
it was the meeting at Polygram.

35:35.901 --> 35:37.402
We all gotta eat, Crown.

35:37.436 --> 35:39.471
My kid's mother is about
to take me to court

35:39.505 --> 35:41.173
for missed child support.

35:41.206 --> 35:42.207
How much you need?

35:43.542 --> 35:45.344
You're payin' the bills now?

35:45.377 --> 35:47.446
Yeah.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.147
Lou's my boy.

35:49.181 --> 35:51.216
He's here to help.

35:53.252 --> 35:55.287
That's why he here.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.321
Right?

35:57.623 --> 35:59.658
How much you need
to keep the lights on?

36:00.726 --> 36:02.594
And to keep
your baby moms quiet?

36:05.631 --> 36:06.899
Couple Gs.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.338
You good, then.

36:13.372 --> 36:14.840
The guys down the hall
need to get paid as well.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.575
Whoa, worry about yourself,
Milo.

36:16.608 --> 36:17.743
Get on the board.

36:19.945 --> 36:22.814
And my niece singin'
on the song, by the way.

36:22.848 --> 36:23.882
Uncle Lou, I--

36:26.885 --> 36:28.287
Now, you know this ain't no

36:28.320 --> 36:31.223
Brady Bunch
family fucking band.

36:31.256 --> 36:32.858
We need a professional vocalist
in here, man.

36:32.891 --> 36:35.861
Maybe we should let Crown
do what he does, baby.

36:37.563 --> 36:40.832
Juke been makin' money on her
voice since she was five.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.701
Everyone in the neighborhood
used to give her a quarter

36:42.734 --> 36:43.835
to hear they favorite song.

36:46.238 --> 36:48.807
That's why we call her Jukebox.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.542
Get in there, Juke.

36:50.576 --> 36:52.444
Uncle Lou, it's fine.

36:56.648 --> 36:59.251
Hey.

36:59.284 --> 37:00.986
I just paid
for your studio time.

37:03.388 --> 37:04.590
Time is money, Lou.

37:04.623 --> 37:06.558
No, nigga.

37:06.592 --> 37:08.327
Money is money.

37:20.472 --> 37:21.840
You can drop me right here.

37:21.873 --> 37:23.375
Your house is still
a few blocks up.

37:23.408 --> 37:24.476
I can walk.

37:24.509 --> 37:26.278
Yo, right here, right here.

37:44.396 --> 37:46.999
Is there any way you don't
tell my moms about this?

37:48.700 --> 37:52.537
Man, Kanan, that's-that's
complicated, brother.

37:52.571 --> 37:53.705
I mean, it's not my place.

37:53.739 --> 37:56.541
Cops were just messin' with me.

37:56.575 --> 37:59.745
You said it yourself.
Wasn't even about nothin'.

37:59.778 --> 38:03.482
Is that why you called me?
So your mom wouldn't find out?

38:03.515 --> 38:06.485
You a guy.
You know how mothers can be.

38:10.555 --> 38:12.591
Foster kid.

38:12.624 --> 38:15.527
Yeah, never really
knew my moms.

38:18.764 --> 38:20.799
-My bad.
-Nah.

38:20.832 --> 38:23.301
Look, I can't get
in the middle of you and Raq.

38:23.335 --> 38:24.936
-That's not my place.
-Symphony.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.738
She finds out,

38:26.772 --> 38:29.374
she lockin' me in my room
and tossin' the key.

38:29.408 --> 38:30.842
You ain't even gon'
see me in class.

38:30.876 --> 38:33.845
She won't pull you from class.

38:33.879 --> 38:36.481
Well, you still don't
know her, then.

38:36.515 --> 38:39.651
When she burn shit down,
she burn it all down.

38:49.027 --> 38:50.595
If she asks me,
I'm comin' clean.

38:50.629 --> 38:51.863
I won't lie to her.

38:53.465 --> 38:55.033
But won't offer it up,
either.

38:59.738 --> 39:00.772
Thanks, man.

39:02.808 --> 39:04.443
Just so I know,

39:04.476 --> 39:06.578
why didn't you call
your uncles instead of me?

39:10.682 --> 39:11.950
I couldn't reach 'em.

39:21.593 --> 39:22.694

I'm doin' this is 'cause...

44:23.428 --> 44:24.763
if somethin'
ever happens to me,

44:24.796 --> 44:26.698
I want you to be good.

44:26.731 --> 44:28.700
I want you to be able

promised nothin'

44:31.002 --> 44:33.038

a promise I can keep.

is, what we're doin' here

45:07.205 --> 45:08.740
