00:01.000 --> 00:03.071
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:03.104 --> 00:06.540
-Dawn, what happened here?
-I saw Mom.

00:06.573 --> 00:09.910
It's the big bad, Dawn.
The one we knew was coming.

00:09.942 --> 00:13.814
I believe in you, Spike.

00:13.846 --> 00:17.818
BUFFY: They were after
 Spike all along. We know what
 we're up against: The First.

00:17.850 --> 00:21.355
FIRST/BUFFY: Now, Spike,
 you want to see what
 a real vampire looks like?

00:21.388 --> 00:24.824
GILES: As Neanderthals
 are to human beings,
 the Turok-Han are to vampires.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.894
Ferociously powerful
 killing machines,
 as single-minded as animals.

00:27.928 --> 00:30.064
They are the vampires
that vampires fear.

00:30.097 --> 00:32.332
Nice place.
Bit of a mess.

00:32.365 --> 00:33.933
DAWN:
 They're all Slayers?

00:33.966 --> 00:36.570
GILES:
Potential Slayers,
waiting for one to be called.

00:36.603 --> 00:40.006
There were many more like
them all over the world,
but, um,

00:40.039 --> 00:42.909
now there's just a handful,
 and they're all on their way
 to Sunnydale.

00:42.942 --> 00:44.878
KENNEDY:
 How many girls arriving today?

00:44.911 --> 00:46.579
WILLOW:
Just one.

00:46.613 --> 00:50.084
But since Giles
has the coven searching for
other Slayers-in-waiting,

00:50.118 --> 00:52.920
I bet we'll be seeing
 a lot more soon enough.

00:52.953 --> 00:56.055
-Rona, right?
-You're her.

00:56.090 --> 00:59.859
Another potential arrived in
town the day before yesterday.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.896
She's cold.
Been dead for days.

01:02.929 --> 01:05.698
XANDER: Poor kid. She made
 it all the way to Sunnydale
 just to get herself killed.

01:05.733 --> 01:08.968
-BUFFY: Eve.
-XANDER: Eve, who's
in our house?

01:09.001 --> 01:11.938
-Get away from them.
-Buffy, what did Eve do?
-That's not Eve.

01:11.971 --> 01:15.475
One more down. Oh, well.
Can't save them all,
can you, Buffy?

01:16.477 --> 01:17.745
Bye.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.786
BUFFY:
 I don't know
 what's coming next.

01:25.819 --> 01:28.388
But I do know it's
gonna be just like this.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.057
Hard.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.759
Painful.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.995
Believe it.
 We'll be the ones
 left standing.

01:36.864 --> 01:37.930
(sighs)

01:37.965 --> 01:39.700
Ohh.

02:07.694 --> 02:08.860
(twig snapping)

02:10.497 --> 02:11.365
(growls)

02:13.634 --> 02:16.135
(growling)

02:16.170 --> 02:17.670
(screams)

02:19.639 --> 02:22.376
-(whimpers)
-Okay.

02:22.409 --> 02:25.111
These two are dead.
Why?

02:25.145 --> 02:27.615
'Cause the black chick
always gets it first?

02:27.647 --> 02:29.783
-Ow, ow.
-What was that, Rona?

02:29.817 --> 02:32.485
I'm dead because
he's a vampire.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.122
I don't have Slayer strength,
Slayer speed.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.490
-It wasn't a fair fight.
-SPIKE: Vi.

02:37.525 --> 02:41.562
-Do you think I care
if it's a fair fight?
-No. No. No, sir.

02:41.594 --> 02:44.698
You don't play
by the rules,

02:44.731 --> 02:47.468
and I have learned
a valuable lesson of some sort.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.336
-Ow.
-Okay, Spike.

02:51.239 --> 02:53.341
You're right.

02:53.373 --> 02:55.575
You don't have
Slayer strength,

02:55.609 --> 02:58.010
but that doesn't mean
that you're not strong.

02:58.045 --> 03:02.181
-You have inherent abilities
that others do not have.
-Not like you do.

03:02.216 --> 03:06.019
No, not yet,
but it's there.

03:07.254 --> 03:09.188
You have the potential.

03:09.223 --> 03:12.592
Okay? You have strength,
speed, instinct.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.562
You just have to learn
to trust yourself. Rona.

03:15.596 --> 03:19.066
What did your instincts
tell you to do just then?

03:19.098 --> 03:22.034
Block his attack,
keep him off balance,

03:22.068 --> 03:24.170
gain the advantage.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.408
-No, they didn't.
-They told me to run.

03:27.441 --> 03:31.512
-Vi?
-They told me to run.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.848
They're still sort of
telling me to run.

03:34.882 --> 03:38.252
Don't fight on his terms.
Your gut's telling you
to run, run.

03:38.286 --> 03:42.088
Okay? Regain the higher ground.
Make the fight your own.

03:42.122 --> 03:45.125
Spike, what did your instincts
tell you to do just then?

03:45.158 --> 03:48.262
Hunt. Kill.

03:48.295 --> 03:51.664
Come at me, full speed.

03:53.401 --> 03:55.902
He needs to kill to live.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.104
-That tells you everything
you need to know.
-(growling)

04:01.442 --> 04:06.112
Instinct.
Understand his,
but trust yours.

04:06.145 --> 04:09.582
-You were chosen for a reason.
-(grunts, gulps)

04:09.616 --> 04:12.085
-A-Are you okay?
-Fine.

04:12.118 --> 04:14.987
Couple of ribs
ain't quite set right since--
I'm fine.

04:15.087 --> 04:16.923
-Let me see. Spike.
-No, it's--

04:16.956 --> 04:18.158
Buffy. I'm okay.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.096
I'm gonna be okay.

04:23.129 --> 04:25.332
That's hot.

04:25.365 --> 04:29.336
So we're supposed to,
like, make out with him
or something?

04:29.370 --> 04:31.137
Careful, Buffy.

04:31.170 --> 04:35.141
Just when you think
it's part of the lesson,
he'll... hurt your arm.

04:41.814 --> 04:45.619
Molly, Kennedy, let's go.
You're up. Next lesson.

04:54.026 --> 04:55.295
(theme music playing)

05:50.518 --> 05:53.319
-(potentials chattering)
-RONA: One-armed
push-ups are bull.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.723
-KENNEDY:
I can do 'em.
-VI: Bananas.

05:55.755 --> 05:59.326
RONA: I'm more of a chin-up
kind of girl. I can do chin-ups
till the cows come home.

05:59.358 --> 06:02.596
I can do the kind
where you clap between.
(laughing)

06:05.232 --> 06:08.901
You're all gonna die,
but you knew that already.

06:08.935 --> 06:11.538
'Cause that's the cool reward
for being human.

06:11.572 --> 06:14.206
The big dessert
at the end of the meal.

06:15.942 --> 06:18.011
Don't kid yourselves,
you guys.

06:18.045 --> 06:21.213
This whole thing
is all about death.

06:21.247 --> 06:23.651
You think you're different
'cause you might be
the next Slayer?

06:25.117 --> 06:27.454
Death is what
a Slayer breathes,

06:27.487 --> 06:29.055
what a Slayer dreams about
when she sleeps.

06:29.088 --> 06:31.223
Death is what
a Slayer lives.

06:33.159 --> 06:35.362
My death could make you
the next Slayer.

06:35.394 --> 06:39.132
Oh, goody.
Rapt attention.

06:39.165 --> 06:40.567
I love that so much.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.072
Now, where was I?

06:46.105 --> 06:48.442
-Ah.
-(clattering)

06:48.475 --> 06:50.778
If we go with
what Anya's resources
are telling us,

06:50.810 --> 06:55.749
then the First is in remission
for a while, which we think
means advantage us.

06:55.783 --> 06:58.619
But what does that mean,
about the First?

06:58.651 --> 07:00.920
Best we can tell,

07:00.954 --> 07:03.824
he, or more precisely, it,

07:03.857 --> 07:08.295
was putting a lot of stock
in that ubervamp thing,
the Chaka Khan.

07:08.327 --> 07:10.262
Turok-Han?

07:10.297 --> 07:14.968
So when I kicked its ass,
the whole Firsty circus decided
to back off for a while.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.103
Good news?

07:17.137 --> 07:20.139
It means you probably don't
have to worry about it pulling
Spike's strings for a while.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.911
Here's the half empty.

07:24.944 --> 07:28.281
Time away means
time to regroup,

07:28.314 --> 07:31.685
and part of that regrouping
is coming back
stronger than ever.

07:31.718 --> 07:34.187
The odds
are against us.

07:34.221 --> 07:37.524
Time is against us.

07:37.557 --> 07:39.627
And some of us will die
in this battle.

07:41.327 --> 07:43.730
Decide now that
it's not going to be you.

07:47.334 --> 07:50.002
I know
you're all tired,

07:50.036 --> 07:52.204
far away from home,
anxious.

07:53.706 --> 07:55.475
But you're all special.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.713
Most people in this world
have no idea why they're here

08:00.747 --> 08:03.016
or what they want to do.

08:04.517 --> 08:05.819
You do.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.355
You have a mission.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.891
A reason for being here.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.863
You're not here
by chance.

08:16.896 --> 08:21.033
You're here because
you are the Chosen Ones.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.774
Dawn, you'd better hurry up
and eat something so you're
not late for school.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.745
(bell ringing)

08:32.779 --> 08:36.414
Xander, I know.
I'm sorry.

08:36.448 --> 08:39.753
If you're gonna take a shower
at my house, lock the door.

08:39.787 --> 08:41.788
Of course they're curious.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.527
(no dialogue)

08:47.561 --> 08:50.496
Hey, I gotta go.
Uh, has Giles checked in yet?

08:50.529 --> 08:55.368
I thought he was picking up
that Chao-Ahn girl
in Shanghai yesterday.

08:55.402 --> 08:59.371
Okay. Well, let me know
if he does. Bye.

08:59.405 --> 09:01.575
(sighs)
Amanda, right?

09:01.609 --> 09:05.378
-I'm all yours.
-Do people ever think
you're weird?

09:05.412 --> 09:08.115
Uh, I guess.

09:08.148 --> 09:13.620
Sure, in a charming,
endearing, lovable--

09:13.653 --> 09:15.355
Yeah.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.758
I feel like people
think I'm weird

09:17.791 --> 09:21.729
and so they pick on me.
But I might be. Weird.

09:21.761 --> 09:24.130
Amanda, why do you think
that you're weird?

09:24.163 --> 09:27.735
Well, one of the boys
who picks on me,

09:27.768 --> 09:29.937
I kind of--

09:29.970 --> 09:33.405
See, if a guy
picks on you,

09:33.440 --> 09:34.975
is it weird
to think he's cute?

09:36.275 --> 09:38.411
Oh.
(chuckles)

09:38.445 --> 09:41.048
It's just the last few times
I've seen him,

09:41.081 --> 09:43.482
I've wanted to, you know,

09:43.515 --> 09:46.485
pick on him extra, more.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.421
Uh-huh.

09:48.455 --> 09:51.959
The thing is,
I can't tell.

09:51.991 --> 09:55.461
My mom says
when a guy teases you,
it means he likes you.

09:55.495 --> 09:58.765
-Sometimes that's true.
-Is it weird?

09:58.798 --> 10:02.469
We're mean to each other,
and we like each other.

10:02.501 --> 10:06.139
Well, it depends.

10:06.173 --> 10:09.743
Sometimes that's how
people relate--

10:09.777 --> 10:11.778
being mean to each other.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.147
Even mortal enemies.

10:15.716 --> 10:19.286
Then with the--
And that leads to no good.

10:19.318 --> 10:23.123
Absolutely no good.
And much confusion.

10:23.155 --> 10:26.592
And then it's over,
absolutely, seriously,
definitely over.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.096
And that's confusing too,
the over part.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.197
Which it is-- Over.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.903
So... maybe.

10:40.539 --> 10:42.341
(loud arguing)

10:45.077 --> 10:47.780
There might be a more
appropriate place to do that,

10:47.815 --> 10:50.383
like maybe outside,
in a different state.

10:50.417 --> 10:53.086
Why do we always
have to yell?

10:54.386 --> 10:55.889
I was only gone
a couple of hours.

10:57.590 --> 11:01.061
-Buffy.
-Hey, everybody, look.
It's Willow.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.629
Perhaps with
a blunt weapon
of some sort.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.197
Buffy,
we just got news.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.802
And she's sure?

11:09.836 --> 11:11.839
Positive.

11:11.871 --> 11:15.241
Althenea said the seers located
another potential Slayer
here in Sunnydale,

11:15.274 --> 11:17.177
someone that
already lives here.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.046
(sighs)
Oh, God.

11:19.078 --> 11:20.413
ANYA:
All these girls
flocking to town,

11:20.447 --> 11:22.349
and this one's already here
right under our noses.

11:22.381 --> 11:26.720
Wait. The seers couldn't
find out her name or, like,
her address or anything?

11:26.754 --> 11:29.688
Am I getting the definition
of "seer" wrong?

11:29.722 --> 11:32.692
I was going to
take the girls out tonight
for a little show and tell,

11:32.725 --> 11:34.827
but maybe now
I shouldn't.

11:34.861 --> 11:38.030
They were so excited.
You're gonna break
their little hearts.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.700
This town is lousy
with Bringers.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.269
I don't want to risk
that they find
this new girl first.

11:43.302 --> 11:47.106
No, you should go.
I can do a spell
to find her tonight.

11:47.139 --> 11:49.341
I just have to get together
a few ingredients.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.078
But you shouldn't
skip your training.
It's too important.

11:52.111 --> 11:54.346
You think
you can handle it?

11:54.380 --> 11:58.085
-No problemo.
-Yeah. you guys have
more important things to do.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.754
Okay. I'll take 'em.

12:00.788 --> 12:03.190
Yes!

12:03.222 --> 12:05.658
Andrew,
you're not going.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.629
Ooh, crossbow.
Gotta love it.

12:09.662 --> 12:12.032
Feels like
I'm storming a castle.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.466
You do a lot of that,
do you?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.601
I might if I had
a beauty like this.

12:15.634 --> 12:18.471
Halt!

12:18.504 --> 12:20.273
Okay, see, that's why
we don't point the weapons
in the kitchen.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.475
It's not loaded.

12:22.509 --> 12:26.245
That's always the lead quote
under the headline, "Household
Crossbow Accident Claims Teen."

12:26.278 --> 12:29.982
-Oh, a mace.
-Yeah, that's better.

12:30.017 --> 12:32.052
Gotta go with the stake.
It's classic.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.923
-I like the feel
of wood in my hand.
-Lost me there.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.325
Hey, are we
gearing up already?

12:38.357 --> 12:41.961
Oh, right.
You guys are going on
your little group patrol.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.764
It's more than that.
It's an outing.

12:44.798 --> 12:48.268
I'm thinking tonight
we might actually
get to kill things.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.937
-I've killed things sometimes.
-I'm not begging.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.273
You're like a small dog
dancing for Snausages.

12:53.306 --> 12:57.911
-You don't want me coming along
'cause you think I'm evil.
-He doesn't seem evil, exactly.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.179
He's not evil,
but when he gets close to it,

13:00.212 --> 13:03.416
he picks up its flavor
like a mushroom or something.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.852
But I'm reformed.
I'm like Vegeta
on Dragon Ball Z.

13:05.885 --> 13:09.755
I used to be a pure Saiyan,
and now I fight
on the side of Goku.

13:09.788 --> 13:11.758
Still not coming.

13:11.791 --> 13:15.794
It's not fair.
Spike has killed people,
and he gets to go.

13:15.828 --> 13:18.966
Spike didn't have free will.
You did.

13:18.999 --> 13:22.469
(sighs)
I hate my free will.

13:22.501 --> 13:26.005
-This where you're all hiding.
We ready to go or what?
-POTENTIALS: Hey, Spike!

13:26.038 --> 13:27.807
Let's go, girls.
Grab your weapons.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.011
-RONA: All right, let's do it.
-KENNEDY: Okay.

13:32.044 --> 13:34.681
RONA: I don't know
about you guys, but I'm ready
to kick some serious--

13:35.982 --> 13:37.850
You want to play
 Dragon Ball Z?

13:39.818 --> 13:43.289
Okay,
I got my tumbleweed,
my eggs,

13:43.322 --> 13:46.326
got my chrysalises...

13:46.359 --> 13:48.495
Chrysali?

13:48.528 --> 13:51.630
My butterfly transformer pods.

13:51.663 --> 13:54.134
Hey, where is
my snakeskin?

13:54.167 --> 13:57.070
At your s-s-service,
Miss Rosenberg,

13:57.104 --> 13:59.873
s-s-s-sir.

14:03.910 --> 14:08.181
Can you imagine if every once
in a while, people wriggled
out of their skin

14:08.215 --> 14:10.984
and left it behind them,
like, on the sidewalk?

14:11.018 --> 14:13.019
Talk about embarrassing.

14:13.052 --> 14:17.389
Hey, do you think this girl,
uh, this Potential,
goes to Sunnydale?

14:17.423 --> 14:20.192
Hmm.
Well, I guess probably, huh?

14:20.226 --> 14:22.595
I mean, she's gotta be
about that age.

14:22.629 --> 14:26.499
Could be anybody.
Could be that glamazon
in gym class.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.868
What's her name?

14:28.902 --> 14:31.571
Oh, my lab partner,
Margo, the freak.

14:31.604 --> 14:35.107
I hope not, because she totally
fainted right in the middle
of our fetal pig dissection.

14:35.142 --> 14:38.544
Somehow I just
don't think she's cut out
for the slayage biz.

14:38.577 --> 14:42.349
Killing pigs
is just so wrong.
And also hard.

14:42.381 --> 14:45.018
Well, we'll know soon enough
who the next Potential is.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.754
Somebody's life
is about to change.

14:47.787 --> 14:51.524
How long will it take?
Will you find out who it is
right away?

14:51.557 --> 14:54.961
Pretty much.
The spell will conjure up
this brilliant light,

14:54.995 --> 14:57.596
and the light
will find the Potential,

14:57.629 --> 15:00.399
and it will illuminate her
with a glowing aura.

15:00.432 --> 15:03.436
-Cool.
-I've enchanted this map

15:03.470 --> 15:06.038
so that we can track
her basic location.

15:06.072 --> 15:09.042
We'll have to hotfoot it,
but I'm betting
we find her tonight.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.043
DAWN: You know,
if it is Margo,

15:11.077 --> 15:13.712
she's so gonna faint.

15:13.745 --> 15:18.451
To light the aura of the new,
skin of snake and chrysalis too.

15:18.485 --> 15:21.620
To indicate
the fresh reborn,

15:21.653 --> 15:25.658
tumbleweed
and rosebush thorn.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.227
An egg that means
the life to come.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.929
Take this, oh spirits,
and my spell is done.

15:30.963 --> 15:33.265
(coughing)

15:33.299 --> 15:35.902
Oh, good God!
What is that smell?

15:35.934 --> 15:38.971
Fairly sure that's the smell
of a hard-boiled egg
being thrown into a fire.

15:39.005 --> 15:41.807
-Uh-huh.
-The smell will lead us
to the Potential.

15:41.841 --> 15:44.311
Or some poor soul who ate
too many chimichangas.

15:44.344 --> 15:47.514
She'll also be lit
with a-- a brilliant aura.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.482
Is it supposed to be
shimmying all over like that?

15:50.517 --> 15:53.986
I don't know.
I don't think so.

15:54.020 --> 15:56.155
ANYA:
So you messed up
a spell again.

15:56.188 --> 15:59.525
At least it smells
otherworldly.

15:59.558 --> 16:01.995
No, look. Pretty.

16:02.028 --> 16:05.498
(sighs)
I suck.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.966
I'm sorry, you guys.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.370
Maybe we could
figure something out
on the computer.

16:11.403 --> 16:14.874
Good call.
I'm gonna open the door
and let this place air out.

16:14.907 --> 16:17.710
Don't worry, Wil.
It's really no big.

16:17.744 --> 16:21.280
I just-- I was sure
that it was gonna work.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.750
-(whooshing sound)
-Dawn!

16:25.217 --> 16:27.153
(grunting)

16:34.027 --> 16:35.227
I think it worked.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.639
XANDER:
Dawn!

16:46.673 --> 16:48.040
Dawn, are you okay?

16:51.177 --> 16:53.879
Maybe y-you
did it wrong?

16:53.913 --> 16:56.515
Was it ambiguous
in any way?

16:56.548 --> 17:00.086
Did you maybe say
"potential sailors"?
'Cause I do like the water.

17:00.120 --> 17:04.223
-I did it right.
-Wow. She--
You're a Potential.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.726
You could be
the next Slayer.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.993
-Oh.
-Wow.

17:09.028 --> 17:13.732
It's like one second
you were this klutzy teenager
with fake memories

17:13.766 --> 17:15.535
and a history
of kleptomania,

17:15.567 --> 17:19.105
and then suddenly you're a hero,
a hero with a much abbreviated
life-span.

17:19.137 --> 17:21.874
This is huge!
We have to think
about this.

17:21.906 --> 17:24.711
I can't think about this.
It doesn't fit in my head.

17:24.742 --> 17:28.181
A Slayer.
Makes sense, I guess.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.417
Remember that thing about
they share the same blood
or whatever?

17:31.451 --> 17:32.785
Yeah, I never got that.

17:32.818 --> 17:34.921
She has to die.

17:37.789 --> 17:41.728
I mean,
if I was ever the Slayer,
it would mean she died.

17:41.760 --> 17:45.597
Well, it's a lot like
being the pope in that way,

17:45.632 --> 17:48.300
except you don't have to be
some old Catholic.

17:48.335 --> 17:51.637
We've gotta call Buffy.
She's gonna be so excited.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.440
No, we can't.
She didn't bring
her cell phone.

17:53.472 --> 17:55.907
Well, sure, 'cause
all the important people
are with her.

17:55.942 --> 18:00.212
-You're important now.
-Wh-What happens now?

18:00.247 --> 18:03.950
Well, you could start
by maybe sitting still
for a sec.

18:03.982 --> 18:07.386
(sighs)
I can't. I need to know
what happens to my life.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.056
-Well, I guess Buffy trains you.
-Right.

18:10.088 --> 18:12.558
I train with the Potentials,
o-other Potentials,

18:12.592 --> 18:14.961
learn to do the stuff
they're learning.

18:14.993 --> 18:17.930
We also have to protect you
from the, uh, eyeless guys,

18:17.963 --> 18:19.432
the ones with
the sharp, sharp knives.

18:19.465 --> 18:23.135
-Bringers.
-It's okay. We'll protect you.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.672
-What if they saw the spell?
-Saw the spell?

18:25.704 --> 18:29.008
Dawn, they can't see
flash cards. Big ones.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.344
We did a big, orange,
powerful spell.

18:31.377 --> 18:33.346
What if they sensed it?
What if they're on their way?

18:33.380 --> 18:35.147
Are we gonna
replace the microwave?

18:35.182 --> 18:38.884
'Cause I was thinking
some Orville Redenbacher
with fresh butter flavor.

18:40.653 --> 18:41.953
What's going on?

18:41.988 --> 18:44.590
Dawn's gonna be a Slayer.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.859
Holy crap! Excuse me.

18:47.894 --> 18:51.698
Plucked from an ordinary life,
handed a destiny?

18:51.730 --> 18:55.335
-Say "Skywalker,"
and I smack you.
-Does Buffy know?

18:55.367 --> 18:57.636
-She didn't
take her phone.
-(sighs)

18:57.670 --> 19:00.307
-Incommunicado.
-Well, we'll tell her
as soon as she gets back.

19:00.339 --> 19:03.142
-Let's not.
-What? Dawn, she has to know.

19:03.175 --> 19:07.680
I-I know.
Just not right away.

19:07.713 --> 19:10.950
Guys, when Mom
appeared to me,
she said--

19:10.982 --> 19:12.852
-Dawnie.
-No. Please.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.856
She said
something about Buffy,
and I'm thinking...

19:20.058 --> 19:22.628
I'm just not so sure
Buffy will be happy for me.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.497
-Of course she will.
-Will she?

19:24.530 --> 19:28.500
I'm not even sure I'm
happy for me. Everything's
different for me now.

19:28.535 --> 19:32.439
That's because you're
a part of something larger,
like being swallowed...

19:32.538 --> 19:33.873
by something larger.

19:33.905 --> 19:37.644
This-- this is too much
for my head again.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.112
I-I can't--
I need to be--

19:43.450 --> 19:45.551
Nice job with
the getting-swallowed
analogy.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.386
But it is a mixed bag,
you know.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.557
If she gets to be the Slayer,
then her life is short
and brutal

19:50.589 --> 19:53.593
and if she doesn't,
then it smells
of unfulfilled potential.

19:53.625 --> 19:56.328
My swallowed analogy looks
pretty sweet right now,
doesn't it?

19:56.363 --> 19:58.163
It's not like that.

19:58.197 --> 20:02.701
It's like she's part
of this huge power.

20:02.734 --> 20:05.738
I know what that feels like.
It feels wonderful.

20:05.771 --> 20:08.508
Yes, Willow so captured it.
It's like--

20:08.540 --> 20:12.545
Well, it's almost like
this metaphor for womanhood,
isn't it?

20:12.578 --> 20:15.847
The sort of flowering
that happens
when a girl realizes

20:15.882 --> 20:20.185
that she's part
of a fertile heritage
stretching back to Eve and--

20:20.219 --> 20:22.054
I'll pay you to talk
about Star Wars again.

20:22.087 --> 20:23.955
ANYA:
This isn't about womanly power.

20:23.990 --> 20:27.125
This is about the fact that
Dawn just might have bought
herself an early death.

20:27.159 --> 20:31.597
-We don't know that.
-Right. All we know is that
everything just changed.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.567
WILLOW:
Someone should go find Buffy.
I still think she needs to know.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.302
XANDER:
Hey, well, what if
she doesn't like it?

20:36.336 --> 20:39.070
WILLOW: Are you worried
about what Dawn said,
about the ghost?

20:39.105 --> 20:41.441
Xander, we don't even know
if that really was Joyce.

20:41.473 --> 20:43.209
And we don't know
what she meant about Buffy.

20:43.241 --> 20:45.412
I'm not talking about that.
I mean, what do you think

20:45.444 --> 20:47.413
Buffy's gonna do
with this information?

20:47.447 --> 20:50.750
Jump up and down,
teach Dawn the secret handshake?
She knows what this means.

20:50.782 --> 20:54.787
Short, brutal life.
Sharp, sharp knives.
I covered this.

20:54.820 --> 20:57.457
Right. You think Buffy
really wants that for Dawn?

20:57.490 --> 21:01.059
And besides, Dawn doesn't want
any of us telling her yet.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.663
WILLOW:
Dawn's freaking out. Her input--
not worth that much right now.

21:04.696 --> 21:06.965
ANYA:
She's a child. Of course
she can't handle this.

21:06.999 --> 21:10.569
XANDER: Hey! Something out there
said she could handle this
and a hell of a lot more.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.105
Something out there
chose her.
I'm chosen.

21:13.138 --> 21:14.307
WILLOW:
Sure, she can handle it.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.608
Is that why she's hiding
in her room right now?

21:16.643 --> 21:19.479
XANDER:
She's just getting used to it.
Let it happen.

21:19.511 --> 21:21.580
-She doesn't have to rush.
-ANYA: He's right.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.848
We shouldn't rush her.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.652
Rushing's only gonna
get her killed.

21:39.230 --> 21:41.634
MALE (laughing):
Take that!

21:41.667 --> 21:43.369
RONA:
This is a bar.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.771
Best damn field trip
I ever took.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.474
Look, they're all--
they're demons.

21:48.508 --> 21:51.544
It's a demon bar.

21:51.577 --> 21:54.113
It's like a gay bar,
only with demons.

21:54.145 --> 21:55.714
Spike!

21:58.017 --> 21:59.519
Long time.

21:59.551 --> 22:01.721
Nice of you
to bring snacks.

22:01.753 --> 22:03.722
Touch them
and lose your privates.

22:07.159 --> 22:10.962
-I didn't like him.
-Nice job of blending in, girls.

22:10.997 --> 22:13.031
We're a bunch of 15-year-olds
in a demon bar.

22:13.065 --> 22:15.166
How much blending
did you think we were gonna do?

22:15.201 --> 22:18.704
Look, it's okay.
Usually, you come to a place
like this, you want to be seen.

22:18.738 --> 22:21.473
You want to scare someone
or make contact.

22:21.508 --> 22:24.242
-Or have a strong drink?
-Not usually that.

22:24.276 --> 22:26.712
-You don't drink?
-Sure, I do.

22:26.746 --> 22:29.214
I mean, no.
It would be wrong.

22:29.248 --> 22:33.019
-Do they card?
-Nope. Go ahead.

22:33.051 --> 22:36.556
Down all the yak urine shots
or pig's butt spritzers
you like.

22:38.590 --> 22:41.160
-Gross.
-Got that right.

22:41.192 --> 22:44.195
The prices they charge,
you should get human blood
straight from the body.

22:45.798 --> 22:49.402
-Vampire.
-BUFFY: Look, if I come here,

22:49.435 --> 22:53.740
it's because I gotta wring
information out of something
large, scary, drunk,

22:53.772 --> 22:56.843
with a room full of friends
who don't care very much
for the Slayer.

22:56.875 --> 23:00.211
Remember that. Not a being
in here that wouldn't gladly
rip your throat out.

23:00.246 --> 23:03.281
Buffy?
Girl, how you been?

23:03.315 --> 23:07.720
Clem! You look great,
so toned.

23:07.753 --> 23:09.422
He's ripping out
her throat right now.

23:09.455 --> 23:11.190
Oh my god.
It is so good to see you.

23:11.222 --> 23:14.594
I saw this great show on the
History Channel the other night
that I knew you would love

23:14.626 --> 23:16.295
and then something went
all flooey with my TiVo.

23:16.394 --> 23:18.196
You know what?
Can I talk to you for a second
over here.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.432
-Oh, yeah.
-You think she
dated him too?

23:24.002 --> 23:27.640
-Okay, everyone.
This is the girls.
-Howdy.

23:29.275 --> 23:31.644
So, you girls are gonna
deal with demons, huh?

23:33.078 --> 23:35.280
Just let me tell you this.

23:36.414 --> 23:39.250
(all screaming)

23:39.285 --> 23:42.354
I could use a shot
of that yak urine
right about now.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.934
Hey.

23:55.968 --> 23:59.005
Hey, Dawn.
What you doin'?

23:59.038 --> 24:03.009
Uh, just walking.
You?

24:03.041 --> 24:06.144
Um, yeah.
Just walkin' too.

24:06.178 --> 24:10.249
Okay.
Well, have a good walk.

24:10.281 --> 24:13.051
-I guess I'll see you
Monday morning?
-Yeah.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.656
You all right?

24:17.690 --> 24:21.493
Sure.
Just walking, you know?

24:25.230 --> 24:28.734
A-Are you all right?
You've got a thing.

24:35.207 --> 24:39.111
I guess I--
I had a bit of a--

24:39.144 --> 24:41.814
It's been a bizarre night.

24:41.847 --> 24:45.116
What happened?
Who did that to you?

24:45.151 --> 24:49.188
Uh... nobody, exactly.

24:49.221 --> 24:52.991
-I don't think you'd
exactly believe me.
-Try me.

24:53.025 --> 24:57.163
I was at school late
because of, you know,
Swing Choir,

24:57.195 --> 24:58.897
and I tore my sweater.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.799
You know,
the striped ones we wear.

25:00.833 --> 25:04.036
-So, I went to Home Sciences
to sew it up.
-Uh-huh.

25:04.069 --> 25:08.374
And by the time
I was finished,
the place was empty,

25:08.406 --> 25:12.578
so it was all echoey
and lonely and--

25:12.612 --> 25:15.582
Then there was this guy,
or thing,

25:15.615 --> 25:18.651
and it was--
it scratched me,

25:18.684 --> 25:21.386
and I kind of dodged it,
and it kind of hit its head.

25:21.420 --> 25:23.589
What kind of thing?

25:23.623 --> 25:25.724
I don't know.

25:25.758 --> 25:28.027
It was messed up.

25:28.059 --> 25:30.696
In the face,
around hereabouts.

25:30.730 --> 25:33.865
And when it scratched
at you, did it--

25:35.101 --> 25:38.369
was it scratching
with its teeth?

25:38.403 --> 25:39.806
Is it real?

25:41.574 --> 25:42.942
Was it really a vampire?

25:46.045 --> 25:49.015
-I bet you think
I'm crazy.
-I--

25:49.048 --> 25:50.382
I believe you.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.753
Well, cool.

25:54.787 --> 25:59.458
The thing is,
after it hit its head,
I kind of freaked out.

25:59.490 --> 26:03.194
I trapped it in a room,
and it's still there and now
I don't know what to do.

26:03.229 --> 26:06.598
It's okay.
This is totally dealable.
Don't worry.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.768
Well, I was thinking
of getting your sister.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.403
You know something
about my sister?

26:11.436 --> 26:14.140
Well, I've heard
people talking.

26:14.173 --> 26:17.108
A lot of 'em think
she's some kind of
high-functioning schizophrenic,

26:17.143 --> 26:23.082
but I also heard that maybe--
like maybe she could help
with this kind of thing.

26:23.115 --> 26:26.051
Do you think
we should go get her?

26:26.085 --> 26:28.721
She's out.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.757
I'll take this one.

26:30.789 --> 26:34.492
(gasping, groans)
Whew!

26:34.526 --> 26:36.895
I think
I strained something.

26:36.929 --> 26:40.633
-Maybe something
I'll need later in life.
-Come on.

26:40.666 --> 26:44.403
The vampire's
upstairs.

26:44.435 --> 26:47.472
-Are you spooked out?
-No.

26:47.506 --> 26:50.576
I'm all right.
I can do this.

26:50.608 --> 26:53.278
It's mostly instinct,
I think.

26:53.311 --> 26:55.682
-(slams)
-(screams)

26:55.714 --> 26:57.282
(giggling)

26:58.951 --> 27:03.122
So, if he scratched me
with a tooth, am I--

27:04.390 --> 27:07.259
I'm not gonna turn
into one, am I?

27:07.292 --> 27:11.196
Only if he slashed open one
of his own veins and led you
to drink deep of his blood.

27:11.230 --> 27:14.432
-Nope.
-(sighs)

27:14.465 --> 27:17.603
Good. You're lucky
he didn't hurt you
way more than that.

27:17.635 --> 27:20.471
Right.
He can do that.

27:20.506 --> 27:23.474
So, I was thinking,

27:23.509 --> 27:25.845
we don't have to kill
the vampire, do we?

27:25.877 --> 27:27.946
What?

27:27.980 --> 27:30.817
Uh, just suppose he got out
and was maybe, like,

27:30.849 --> 27:33.384
encouraged toward the gym
while the marching band
was playing.

27:33.419 --> 27:38.257
Because the way they
look down on the Swing Choir,
it might be, you know, funny.

27:39.726 --> 27:41.593
I'm just sayin'.

27:53.239 --> 27:56.909
Well, he didn't break down
the door anyway.

27:56.942 --> 27:59.778
Yeah.
Can they do that?

28:01.780 --> 28:04.817
They're very strong,
and although
they feel pain,

28:04.851 --> 28:07.720
they don't hold back
because of it.

28:07.753 --> 28:10.556
I guess you're some kind
of monster expert too.

28:12.590 --> 28:15.027
Let's just say
it runs in the family.

28:20.398 --> 28:22.300
(sighs)

28:30.308 --> 28:32.944
-DAWN: I thought you said
it was locked.
-It...

28:32.979 --> 28:35.513
it was.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.449
It was here.

28:37.482 --> 28:39.417
Amanda?

28:41.988 --> 28:44.089
It got out.

28:49.828 --> 28:51.430
(growling)

29:02.441 --> 29:04.542
Where'd it go?

29:04.576 --> 29:08.579
I don't know,
but we have to
get out of here.

29:11.682 --> 29:14.153
(screaming)

29:14.185 --> 29:15.421
(screams)

29:31.170 --> 29:33.638
-What are you doing?
-I can never remember!

29:33.672 --> 29:36.875
Does it have to be right side up
or upside down to work?
Which is it?

29:42.314 --> 29:43.281
(screams)

29:49.387 --> 29:51.423
BUFFY:
A vampire is an animal.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.791
Sometimes
they run in packs,

29:53.826 --> 29:56.962
sometimes alone.

29:56.996 --> 30:00.665
-Who can tell us where we are?
-It's a nest.

30:00.699 --> 30:03.669
-How can you tell?
-Only a vamp could live
like this.

30:03.701 --> 30:06.939
Some, yeah.
And as a group, we're not
known for our tasteful decor,

30:06.972 --> 30:12.044
but in all fairness
to the race, this place is
seriously lacking in style.

30:12.077 --> 30:14.680
-Thank you, Spike.
-Merely saying.

30:14.712 --> 30:16.515
He has a point.

30:17.884 --> 30:21.519
Vampires can live anywhere,
any way they want.

30:21.553 --> 30:24.957
Tastes, fashions,
living conditions--
they can vary.

30:24.990 --> 30:28.059
The animal inside?
Always the same.

30:28.094 --> 30:30.195
Where'd you live?

30:30.229 --> 30:32.397
What, you mean before?

30:32.431 --> 30:35.634
A crypt, actually, but nicer.

30:35.666 --> 30:38.003
A bit more...

30:38.037 --> 30:41.373
I don't know if "posh"
is the right word,
but it was more like--

30:41.406 --> 30:42.508
Comfy.

30:42.540 --> 30:45.443
Excuse me?
When did you
find it comfy?

30:47.512 --> 30:49.015
Moving on.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.383
You want to stay alive?

30:51.416 --> 30:55.854
You have to spot
and identify a nest on sight.
Look around, all of you.

30:55.887 --> 31:00.026
Look for signs that last night
maybe two dozen vampires were
right where we're standing.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.628
Go ahead.

31:12.238 --> 31:16.107
Work, work, work.
This little excursion was just
in danger of being interesting.

31:16.142 --> 31:17.977
You know something, Spike?

31:21.613 --> 31:23.848
Interesting
is not a problem.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.117
Buffy, I think
we found something.

31:27.752 --> 31:29.221
It's a body.

31:36.228 --> 31:39.698
It's not a body.
It's leftovers.

31:39.730 --> 31:41.467
(growling)

31:48.807 --> 31:51.109
In here!

31:54.680 --> 31:56.682
Help. We need
to barricade this.

31:58.916 --> 32:01.953
Too small. Oh!

32:01.988 --> 32:05.290
-(grunting)
-Too big.

32:13.164 --> 32:16.102
Stay down.

32:16.134 --> 32:20.071
-You think we're safe?
-(growling)

32:20.105 --> 32:25.010
No one's safe.
Not here, not ever.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.645
-You see this guy?
-But he was dead a minute ago.

32:27.679 --> 32:30.115
That was a minute ago.
Now--

32:31.849 --> 32:33.951
-Hey!
-He's the enemy.

32:35.121 --> 32:36.422
-Amanda?
-Yes?

32:36.454 --> 32:37.823
Listen.

32:37.855 --> 32:39.825
-I'm listening.
-We're gonna
get out of this.

32:39.857 --> 32:42.361
Both of us. Alive.
(screams)

32:42.394 --> 32:45.530
-Do you believe me?
-I believe you.

32:47.398 --> 32:49.468
Good, 'cause I got a plan.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.502
BUFFY:
You can't think too much.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.640
Reacting's better.

32:54.673 --> 32:58.176
It could be the difference
between staying alive
and that other thing.

33:04.516 --> 33:07.719
Okay, this plan of mine?
I'm not guaranteeing
it'll work.

33:07.752 --> 33:10.288
Better than mine
about him eating
the marching band.

33:10.321 --> 33:13.724
Besides,
your plan will work.

33:13.759 --> 33:16.327
(screams)
In case you haven't noticed, I
don't know what I'm doing, here.

33:16.362 --> 33:18.230
You're getting it done.

33:27.772 --> 33:30.241
The question is never
what do you think.

33:30.276 --> 33:32.310
It's always...
what do you know?

33:32.344 --> 33:35.280
You gotta know,
'cause if you don't,
if you make one mistake--

33:37.083 --> 33:39.684
BUFFY:
 It takes just one vampire
 to kill you,

33:39.718 --> 33:42.188
so you've gotta know
 you can take him.
 Know your environment.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.890
Know what's around you
 and know how to use it.

33:52.298 --> 33:57.269
In the hands of a Slayer,
 everything is a weapon,
 if you know how to see it.

33:57.302 --> 34:00.905
When you're fighting,
 you have to know yourself--
 your brain, your body.

34:00.939 --> 34:03.909
Know how to stay calm,
 centered.

34:03.942 --> 34:06.978
Every move is important.
 Every blow's gotta be
 part of your plan

34:07.078 --> 34:10.215
because you make that
 one mistake, then it's over.

34:10.248 --> 34:12.117
-(screaming)
 -You're not the Slayer.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.619
You're not a Potential.

34:15.954 --> 34:18.356
You're dead.
So what do you know?

34:18.389 --> 34:21.293
See now, the only thing
you know for sure?

34:22.628 --> 34:23.829
You got me.

34:25.396 --> 34:26.465
(stake clattering)

34:38.344 --> 34:40.445
Come on, sweetie.
Open up.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.414
-Want me to
kick down the door?
-Anya.

34:42.447 --> 34:44.916
What?
It'd be funny.

34:44.949 --> 34:48.387
And besides,
she's been sulking
in there forever.

34:48.420 --> 34:49.521
Ah.

34:53.324 --> 34:55.092
ANYA:
Crap.

34:57.195 --> 35:00.065
-Double crap.
-Gone.

35:00.097 --> 35:04.001
We gotta find her
before the Bringers do.

35:04.034 --> 35:06.804
I can do a locater spell,
but we've gotta hurry.
And find Buffy.

35:06.838 --> 35:09.807
-Amanda, help me!
-I can't.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.777
Amanda!
(screaming)

35:18.516 --> 35:20.619
No! You don't want her!

35:23.322 --> 35:24.822
You want me.

35:41.306 --> 35:42.641
Amanda!

35:51.916 --> 35:56.387
-What were those?
-Amanda, listen to me.

35:56.422 --> 36:00.125
You remember when
you said I was special?
Well, I'm not.

36:00.157 --> 36:03.061
-You're--
-But the thing is, you are.

36:03.094 --> 36:06.297
-This is your battle, Amanda.
-No. I can't!

36:06.331 --> 36:08.534
You can!
You've got to.

36:08.567 --> 36:12.670
Look, I've got your back,
but this is something
you have to do.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.572
It's something
you were born to do.

36:17.342 --> 36:19.545
Here.
This belongs to you.

36:23.414 --> 36:25.251
XANDER:
Buffy, up here.

36:39.231 --> 36:40.197
Here!

36:41.132 --> 36:42.067
(screams)

36:52.878 --> 36:57.181
Okay, one minute
I'm in Swing Choir,

36:57.215 --> 36:59.585
and the next--

36:59.617 --> 37:01.686
What the hell
is going on?

37:01.719 --> 37:04.088
You tell me to come to you
with problems.

37:04.121 --> 37:07.559
Turns out a vampire
attacked me. Problem.

37:07.592 --> 37:11.195
So, I go to your house,
only when I get there,
this orange cloud hits me.

37:11.228 --> 37:13.731
She was at the doorway.

37:13.764 --> 37:17.469
And I don't know if you're
into drugs, but that's not
my deal, all right?

37:17.503 --> 37:22.072
That cloud hit me,
and I got a little dizzy
and discombobulated.

37:22.106 --> 37:26.512
It was Willow's spell.
She's the potential Slayer.

37:31.583 --> 37:35.320
I'm sure the vampire thought
we were, like, what,
four helpless girls?

37:35.353 --> 37:39.157
-(laughing)
-And then Vi actually yells,
"We're four helpless girls."

37:39.190 --> 37:40.391
That was part of my plan.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.159
When it started going down,

37:42.193 --> 37:44.929
it's like we knew what
we were doing, for real.

37:44.963 --> 37:48.166
Yeah, like when you dodged
that first attack and then
cracked him across the jaw.

37:48.199 --> 37:51.168
No, no. See, I wouldn't have
been able to do that if you
hadn't took his legs out.

37:51.202 --> 37:54.972
I hurt his arm. Yup.
And an arm can be
as lethal as a mouth.

37:55.005 --> 37:57.509
When you staked him, seriously,
the rush was like--

37:57.543 --> 38:00.110
So, you took one out solo.

38:00.144 --> 38:03.114
Yeah. What was that like?

38:04.349 --> 38:05.650
I don't know.

38:05.684 --> 38:10.489
I mean,
when I saw the vampire--

38:10.521 --> 38:13.958
-Vamp?
-Vampire is good too.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.693
Cool.

38:15.726 --> 38:18.128
Yeah, when that vampire
attacked me,

38:18.163 --> 38:22.434
I felt this...
kind of charge. You know?

38:22.467 --> 38:25.036
KENNEDY:
Like you realize
in one instant

38:25.070 --> 38:27.972
that your whole life
is different.

38:28.005 --> 38:30.041
AMANDA:
Exactly.

38:30.074 --> 38:33.311
It's that rush
you're talking about.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.213
Hey.

38:37.715 --> 38:41.018
-You okay?
-Yeah.

38:41.052 --> 38:44.690
I was thinking
of hitting the books,
do some research on the First.

38:44.722 --> 38:47.992
It's in retreat mode now,
but you're still gonna need
to know how to fight it.

38:48.025 --> 38:51.730
Great. Sounds good.
Hey, you guys?

38:51.762 --> 38:54.231
You want to head downstairs,
get our newest arrival
up to speed?

38:54.264 --> 38:55.367
Come on.

39:15.753 --> 39:17.121
What's up?

39:18.523 --> 39:21.226
I'm just thinking
about the girls.

39:21.259 --> 39:24.028
It's a harsh gig
being a Potential.

39:24.061 --> 39:26.597
Just being picked
out of a crowd.

39:26.632 --> 39:30.835
Danger, destiny.
Plus, if you act now, death.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.570
They can handle it.

39:32.603 --> 39:34.905
Yeah.

39:34.940 --> 39:38.108
They're special,
no doubt.

39:38.143 --> 39:42.079
And the amazing thing is,
not one of them
will ever know.

39:42.112 --> 39:43.548
Not even Buffy.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.284
Know what?

39:47.719 --> 39:49.688
How much harder it is
for the rest of us.

39:49.721 --> 39:53.958
-No way. They've got the--
-Seven years, Dawn.

39:53.992 --> 39:56.094
Working with the Slayer,

39:56.126 --> 39:59.396
seeing my friends get
more and more powerful.

39:59.431 --> 40:02.132
A witch, a demon.

40:02.166 --> 40:04.869
Hell, I could fit Oz
in my shaving kit,

40:04.902 --> 40:08.773
but come a full moon,
he had a wolfy mojo
not to be messed with.

40:10.509 --> 40:14.311
Powerful.
All of them.

40:14.344 --> 40:17.148
And I'm the guy
who fixes the windows.

40:20.351 --> 40:23.320
Well, you had that sexy
army training for a while,

40:23.353 --> 40:26.257
and-- and the windows
really did need fixing.

40:26.291 --> 40:28.326
I saw what you did
last night.

40:28.358 --> 40:31.228
Yeah. I--

40:31.262 --> 40:34.264
I guess I kind of lost my head
when I thought I was the Slayer.

40:34.298 --> 40:36.568
You thought you were
all special.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.637
Miss Sunnydale 2003.

40:38.670 --> 40:41.972
And the minute
you found out you weren't,

40:42.007 --> 40:44.775
you handed the crown to Amanda
without a moment's pause.

40:46.210 --> 40:49.114
You gave her your power.

40:49.146 --> 40:50.949
The power wasn't mine.

40:52.851 --> 40:56.521
They'll never know
how tough it is, Dawnie,

40:56.554 --> 40:59.423
to be the one
who isn't chosen,

40:59.456 --> 41:02.027
to live so near
to the spotlight
and never step in it.

41:02.059 --> 41:05.597
But I know.

41:05.630 --> 41:09.300
I see more
than anybody realizes
because nobody's watching me.

41:11.869 --> 41:14.773
I saw you last night.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.742
I see you
working here today.

41:18.510 --> 41:19.811
You're not special.

41:21.679 --> 41:23.347
You're extraordinary.

41:33.190 --> 41:34.925
Maybe that's your power.

41:36.094 --> 41:38.063
What?

41:38.096 --> 41:41.365
Seeing. Knowing.

41:41.398 --> 41:44.570
(chuckles)
Maybe it is.

41:44.603 --> 41:47.038
Maybe I should get a cape.

41:47.072 --> 41:49.507
A cape is good.

41:50.708 --> 41:51.876
Yeah.

42:40.324 --> 42:42.159
Grr! Arrgh!
