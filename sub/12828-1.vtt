WEBVTT

02:38.800 --> 02:40.267
Joan.

02:42.770 --> 02:44.897
Joanie, sugar?

02:49.677 --> 02:51.167
Come on, Joan.

02:51.346 --> 02:53.143
Sugar?

02:53.414 --> 02:55.678
- Wake up, baby.
- No, Arthur, don't.

02:55.850 --> 02:59.183
- Oh, baby. Come on, sugar.
- No. It's too early, Arthur.

02:59.354 --> 03:01.948
- Oh, Joanie, wake up.
- I'm not awake.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.658
Arthur, there isn't time.

03:04.826 --> 03:08.762
- There's always time for this, Joan.
- No. Stop it. Arthur, no. Don't.

03:08.930 --> 03:10.955
I said, no!

03:11.699 --> 03:14.293
Why not? Why not, Joan?

03:14.836 --> 03:18.033
You said you wanted to get away early.
That's what you said.

03:19.273 --> 03:21.935
You never want to, do you? Never.

03:22.110 --> 03:25.739
- Fix the coffee, will you, darling?
- Goddamn coffee.

03:25.913 --> 03:28.882
- Arthur.
- Listen, Joan, don't you understand?

03:29.050 --> 03:32.144
I'm going to be away from home
for four days and nights.

03:32.320 --> 03:36.051
- There's no need to swear, is there?
- That's not much of a cuss.

03:36.224 --> 03:40.126
I don't think it's very nice, Arthur,
especially in your own home.

03:41.729 --> 03:46.291
You don't give me a chance.
You gotta give me a chance.

03:47.001 --> 03:49.401
I don't know what you mean, Arthur.

04:56.170 --> 04:59.765
I wouldn't go all that way
without breakfast. You must eat, sweetie.

04:59.941 --> 05:02.432
I like feeling empty.

05:02.944 --> 05:06.744
You know you don't. What funny things
you say in one of your moods.

05:06.914 --> 05:10.077
I'm empty, Joan.
Nothing inside me. Nothing at all.

05:10.251 --> 05:14.187
Oh, what, Arthur? Not even a song?
Not a teeny-weeny little tune?

05:14.355 --> 05:16.983
I keep them songs in my bag,
not in my heart.

05:17.158 --> 05:19.183
And in your head.

05:20.394 --> 05:24.922
That fella at the bank yesterday said he
didn't reckon there was a fella in Chicago...

05:25.099 --> 05:27.693
who knew more about songs that sell
than me.

05:27.869 --> 05:31.703
- Did he say that?
- He said, "Borrow what you like.

05:32.306 --> 05:37.369
A fella like you is no risk.
No risk at all."

05:38.179 --> 05:42.115
- Is that true, Arthur?
- And I said, "I don't want it.

05:42.283 --> 05:45.775
My wife's got some cash,
and she'll support me."

05:45.953 --> 05:49.480
We need that money, Arthur,
for our old age.

05:49.824 --> 05:53.487
No. We need it now, Joan.

05:53.728 --> 05:57.425
Honey, I'm a good salesman.
I can pick the right songs.

05:57.598 --> 05:59.793
- Jesus Christ almighty.
- Don't blaspheme.

05:59.967 --> 06:02.936
Corn to the left of you,
corn to the right...

06:03.104 --> 06:07.040
and the storekeepers are dumb and windy
as my old granny's asshole.

06:07.208 --> 06:08.436
- Arthur.
- Well...

06:08.609 --> 06:11.203
your hick storekeeper cusses a lot,
believe me.

06:11.379 --> 06:12.937
My daddy didn't. Not ever.

06:13.114 --> 06:15.947
Yeah, but your daddy used to sing
in the church choir.

06:16.117 --> 06:18.984
He was more a Christian
than a storekeeper.

06:19.153 --> 06:22.213
He might overcharge you,
but he said his prayers.

06:22.390 --> 06:24.017
Honey.

06:24.659 --> 06:28.288
He would want you
to use that money he left you.

06:28.496 --> 06:31.954
Money he worked hard for all his life
to save for a rainy day?

06:32.133 --> 06:34.499
It's raining. Pouring.

06:34.669 --> 06:39.402
Oh, cheer up, Arthur.
You won't sell anything without a smile.

06:51.852 --> 06:55.083
- Arthur!
- Make me happy, Joan.

06:55.289 --> 06:58.486
It'd really be nice, huh?
Down here on the floor?

06:58.659 --> 07:01.560
Joan, look.
I want to show you something, Joan.

07:01.729 --> 07:04.163
- Stop! Arthur!
- Birds do it. Bees do it.

07:04.332 --> 07:06.232
Little birdies in the trees do it.

07:12.506 --> 07:14.531
It was just a thought.

07:16.544 --> 07:18.409
A very peculiar thought, Arthur.

07:21.882 --> 07:24.442
Don't you ever listen to the words...

07:24.619 --> 07:26.211
in the songs?

07:26.687 --> 07:28.678
In these songs?

07:28.956 --> 07:30.787
That's not real life.

07:30.958 --> 07:32.755
Real life?

07:33.694 --> 07:36.162
You tell me what real life is.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.127
It's a bowl of dog biscuits.

07:38.299 --> 07:40.927
There's nothing wrong with that,
if you're a dog.

07:43.571 --> 07:47.667
That's what you want.
You want a goddamn poodle.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.402
Not a man. Not a real man!

07:50.578 --> 07:53.445
- Don't be silly, Arthur.
- Well, I'll tell you this...

07:53.614 --> 07:56.674
this is one old dog
who ain't coming back to the kennel.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.409
What do you mean, Arthur?

07:58.586 --> 08:00.611
Three guesses.

08:01.455 --> 08:02.922
Arthur?

08:03.924 --> 08:05.482
<i>A thousand dollars.</i>

08:05.860 --> 08:09.853
What on earth do you want
with $ 1000, Mr. Parker?

08:10.031 --> 08:13.330
- I want more capital for my business.
- Selling sheet music?

08:13.501 --> 08:15.628
Yeah, songs, on commission.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.604
I got a bad territory, see...

08:18.773 --> 08:22.368
East Central Illinois.
God help me.

08:23.010 --> 08:25.979
I want to muscle in on Indianapolis
as well, you get me?

08:26.147 --> 08:28.342
Yes. With all such large sums of money...

08:28.516 --> 08:31.917
the question of adequate collateral
cannot be evaded.

08:32.086 --> 08:33.986
- Pardon?
- Well, you see...

08:34.155 --> 08:36.851
your wife has a deposit account
at this branch.

08:37.024 --> 08:39.993
That's hers. That is separate.
Her dad willed her that.

08:40.160 --> 08:43.892
- If that could be put up as collateral...
- Don't you goddamn understand?

08:44.065 --> 08:45.498
Really, Mr. Parker...

08:45.666 --> 08:48.567
that sort of language
won't help one little bit.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.931
What will help, then? You tell me.

08:51.105 --> 08:54.836
- That's what I've been trying to...
- Without dragging in my wife's cash.

08:55.009 --> 08:58.035
Which represents the only chance
of your getting a loan...

08:58.212 --> 09:00.442
of the size of which you are proposing.

09:00.881 --> 09:04.248
What about this, then?
This is what you sell things with.

09:04.418 --> 09:08.354
It's what's up here that matters.
I know the kind of songs that sell.

09:08.522 --> 09:12.925
I got an instinct, and I get 30 percent
of every song sheet I push to the retailer.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.459
Nearly.

09:14.628 --> 09:18.997
Well, nearly 30 percent of 10 cents.

09:19.633 --> 09:23.694
What's the good of setting up
your own business in America today?

09:23.871 --> 09:26.396
Times are hard.
The Depression is still with us.

09:26.574 --> 09:27.905
And why?

09:28.075 --> 09:30.305
Because of dry rot, that's why.

09:30.778 --> 09:35.715
Salesmanship made this country great,
and salesmanship will keep us great.

09:35.883 --> 09:39.341
Dry rot. That's what's doing
the damage. Dry rot.

09:40.254 --> 09:43.417
That's the stuff you've got
between your ears, pal.

09:45.860 --> 09:47.259
Good day, Parker.

13:07.561 --> 13:08.892
What'd you yell?

13:09.997 --> 13:11.225
Me?

13:11.398 --> 13:12.990
I didn't...

13:13.167 --> 13:16.659
- I didn't holler nothing, sir.
- Anything.

13:16.837 --> 13:19.032
I didn't holler anything.

13:19.206 --> 13:22.232
No. Nor me, sir.

13:23.043 --> 13:25.238
Come on. Get in.

13:26.947 --> 13:29.142
- Bring your case.
- Oh, thank you.

13:29.316 --> 13:33.480
- No extra charge.
- Thanks a million.

13:41.629 --> 13:43.460
Too fast for you, buddy?

13:43.631 --> 13:45.360
Nice, this...

13:46.133 --> 13:47.725
vehicle.

13:47.901 --> 13:49.664
Not bad.

13:51.305 --> 13:53.068
I wish...

13:54.274 --> 13:56.071
Wish what?

13:56.677 --> 13:58.440
I...

13:58.646 --> 14:00.375
wish I had one.

14:04.051 --> 14:06.144
Hey, what's in that case?

14:08.222 --> 14:12.090
- Piano.
- Oh, right, I should have known. A piano.

14:13.093 --> 14:16.460
Piano accordion.

14:16.797 --> 14:18.230
Yeah?

14:18.399 --> 14:20.333
You can play it?

14:22.469 --> 14:24.266
It's my living.

14:42.589 --> 14:47.026
Oh, no. I think I know what I can
and can't sell in my own store, Mr. Parker.

14:47.194 --> 14:50.391
You sure do. I wouldn't try
to tell you what you could sell...

14:50.564 --> 14:55.263
- lf there is a demand for "Desert Moon"...
- "Prairie Moon." "Prairie Moon," sir.

14:55.436 --> 15:00.169
- This is a great, great song, sir.
- If, I can just call the wholesaler, right?

15:00.340 --> 15:03.969
And wait a week? Whereas
if you take a dozen now, you'll be ready...

15:04.144 --> 15:06.669
when they come in that door
asking for the...

15:06.847 --> 15:08.838
One moment, please.

15:11.385 --> 15:13.182
- Can I help you, ma'am?
- I wonder...

15:13.353 --> 15:17.119
You see, I'm looking for part songs
for a children's choir.

15:17.491 --> 15:20.483
Yes, I believe I have one back here.

17:08.367 --> 17:12.065
It's not here, I'm afraid,
but I'm sure I can get it for you, Mrs...

17:12.239 --> 17:13.934
Miss. Miss Everson.

17:14.107 --> 17:18.099
- I want it for the children in my class.
- Could you give me an address?

17:21.315 --> 17:23.681
Miss Eileen Everson...

17:24.785 --> 17:26.616
care of Lincoln Junior School.

17:26.787 --> 17:31.622
Very good, Miss Everson.
I'll see what I can do. Have a nice day.

17:37.264 --> 17:39.164
You know what she needs, don't you?

17:40.934 --> 17:45.530
Just sign for what you have ordered.
Don't talk about a lady like that.

18:02.489 --> 18:05.617
Thank you. Thank you very,
very much, folks. Thank you.

18:05.792 --> 18:08.317
Thank you, folks.
Thank you very, very much.

18:08.495 --> 18:11.487
Thank you, folks.
Thank you very, very much.

18:11.665 --> 18:13.895
It was very nice.

18:15.502 --> 18:17.970
- Pardon, lady?
- It was nice.

18:19.673 --> 18:23.837
- A nice hymn.
- Oh, shall I...

18:24.177 --> 18:26.202
play you another one?

18:26.380 --> 18:30.111
- "The Old Rugged Cross"?
- No, thank you very much.

18:30.284 --> 18:33.685
I'll play "The Old Rugged Cross."

18:33.854 --> 18:35.253
No.

18:37.991 --> 18:39.253
Hello, Father.

18:39.426 --> 18:42.224
- Come on, Eileen.
- Yes, Father.

18:42.396 --> 18:44.091
Let's go, boy.

18:59.246 --> 19:01.476
Shut up, you fool.

19:35.148 --> 19:36.809
How long is it since you ate?

19:37.918 --> 19:40.182
I eat here...

19:40.354 --> 19:43.016
and there.
- Now and then is more like it.

19:47.594 --> 19:49.824
Ain't you hungry, mister?

19:50.397 --> 19:52.729
Oh, I'm hungry, all right.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.630
Didn't you like it?

20:07.114 --> 20:09.548
When you think about things...

20:10.984 --> 20:13.418
before you go to sleep at night...

20:14.688 --> 20:17.054
when your head is still...

20:19.860 --> 20:21.760
No, I don't want it.

20:23.096 --> 20:24.961
You can have it.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.359
And good luck to you, buddy.

24:12.525 --> 24:14.823
Where do you sleep tonight, buddy?

24:18.865 --> 24:20.730
Did you hear what I said?

24:21.034 --> 24:22.399
Alley.

24:22.569 --> 24:24.093
What?

24:24.604 --> 24:26.538
Where I was playing...

24:26.706 --> 24:28.401
there...

24:28.842 --> 24:30.810
was an alley.

24:34.614 --> 24:36.707
There was a girl.

24:36.883 --> 24:40.410
Wasn't there? Gave you some money
just before we came in here.

24:40.587 --> 24:41.815
Yeah.

24:44.291 --> 24:46.282
She was beautiful.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.960
The way she held her head.

24:49.663 --> 24:51.790
The way she walked.

24:52.932 --> 24:55.093
It's funny how one look can...

24:56.803 --> 24:59.033
What are you grinning at?

24:59.205 --> 25:00.638
She...

25:00.907 --> 25:03.102
gave me a dime.
- Is that all you got?

25:03.276 --> 25:06.268
Didn't nobody else put nothing
in the hat?

25:06.546 --> 25:08.776
- No.
- You can't live on a dime.

25:08.948 --> 25:10.609
You're doing worse than me.

25:10.784 --> 25:12.012
Here.

25:12.185 --> 25:13.948
Here's a quarter.

25:14.587 --> 25:18.045
Go on, take it, Rockefeller. Feel rich.

25:20.193 --> 25:22.286
God bless you.

25:23.096 --> 25:25.326
- Bless you.
- Cut it out!

25:25.498 --> 25:28.160
- What are you, a goddamn pansy?
- I'm sorry, mister.

25:28.335 --> 25:31.668
- Sleep on the sidewalk, for all I care.
- Mister...

26:27.360 --> 26:28.759
Don't be scared.

26:29.562 --> 26:31.257
Who are you?

26:33.400 --> 26:36.301
- What are you doing?
- Eileen.

26:36.903 --> 26:38.131
What do you want?

26:39.205 --> 26:42.197
- How do you know my name?
- Eileen.

26:42.409 --> 26:46.243
- Go away. Leave me alone.
- Oh, don't. Oh, please. Please?

26:55.955 --> 26:57.855
I've seen you...

26:59.592 --> 27:01.856
in the music store.

27:02.796 --> 27:04.889
There's a song.

27:05.932 --> 27:07.957
Like in the song.

27:08.201 --> 27:09.828
What?

27:10.203 --> 27:13.070
They tell the truth. Songs do.

27:13.239 --> 27:15.469
Stay where you are, please.

27:15.642 --> 27:20.011
I overheard you say you were a teacher.
I asked some of the kids where you lived.

27:20.914 --> 27:22.176
Why?

27:24.651 --> 27:26.710
I've been looking for you.

27:27.253 --> 27:30.450
All my life, I've been looking
for you, Miss Everson.

27:32.258 --> 27:34.317
I don't understand.

27:36.262 --> 27:39.129
You've been in my head, Eileen...

27:39.532 --> 27:41.591
and in my heart...

27:41.901 --> 27:43.300
in my soul.

27:46.105 --> 27:48.266
I want to talk to you.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.467
Please...

27:50.643 --> 27:52.008
let me talk with you.

27:52.812 --> 27:54.143
Eileen!

27:55.281 --> 27:57.112
Who's that?

27:57.817 --> 27:59.045
My brother.

27:59.719 --> 28:01.482
I gotta talk to you.

28:03.289 --> 28:05.450
Eileen, come here!

28:06.993 --> 28:08.984
I don't even know who you are.

28:10.663 --> 28:12.290
Arthur.

28:12.932 --> 28:14.661
I'm Arthur...

28:16.002 --> 28:17.799
and I love you.

28:19.639 --> 28:22.164
We're never gonna get out
of this Depression.

28:22.342 --> 28:26.369
The hours I put in, door-to-door,
for nothing, peanuts...

28:26.546 --> 28:28.946
selling what is a very good set
of brushes.

28:29.115 --> 28:32.676
- It's the goddamn territory.
- They just slam the door in your face.

28:32.852 --> 28:34.410
Yeah, it's the territory.

28:35.288 --> 28:37.017
There's no doubt about it.

28:37.190 --> 28:39.954
We'd all be smarter bumming the roads.

28:40.126 --> 28:41.821
What do you say, Arthur?

28:41.995 --> 28:44.395
Hard times, ain't it, Arthur?

28:44.998 --> 28:46.522
I'm sorry. What'd you say?

28:47.500 --> 28:51.027
- I don't suppose you're doing too well.
- Not doing very well?

28:52.305 --> 28:54.671
Hey, wake up, old buddy.

28:56.543 --> 28:59.671
I'm doing very well.
Very, very well, indeed-y.

29:01.247 --> 29:04.808
- Heading for the cuckoo house, are you?
- Me?

29:04.984 --> 29:07.009
No chance.

29:08.021 --> 29:10.114
I'll tell you guys something.

29:10.423 --> 29:15.554
Everybody who ever lived in the entire
history of these here United States...

29:15.728 --> 29:18.856
would want to be me
if they knew what I felt like inside.

29:20.533 --> 29:23.468
- What's wrong?
- That's the trouble with you guys.

29:23.636 --> 29:26.799
You walk around with dirt and ash
in your eyeballs.

29:26.973 --> 29:32.536
You just can't begin to see
what a fantastic world it is we live in.

29:32.712 --> 29:35.704
Come on, get your goddamn chins up
off the floor.

29:35.982 --> 29:37.609
It's beautiful.

29:38.051 --> 29:39.575
It is.

29:41.054 --> 29:42.715
Shining.

29:43.456 --> 29:46.186
The whole place is shining.

29:48.094 --> 29:49.755
Can't you see it?

29:51.197 --> 29:53.131
Don't you feel it?

29:54.701 --> 29:59.468
- Sounds like a crate of eggs to me.
- Sliced bologna, more like it.

29:59.639 --> 30:02.130
Yeah, it would to you, Ed, wouldn't it?

30:02.508 --> 30:03.736
What do you mean?

30:03.910 --> 30:07.141
Because you don't know
the young lady in question, do you?

30:08.615 --> 30:10.981
It's impossible to explain.

30:11.150 --> 30:14.244
Not the sort of thing
you can put into words.

30:14.621 --> 30:16.782
Oh, yes, it is.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.782
Did you get your hand up her skirt, Arthur?

32:29.956 --> 32:31.924
You lay her in the back seat?

32:33.025 --> 32:34.788
Has she got big tits?

32:35.128 --> 32:37.619
- Son of a bitch!
- Hey, easy! Easy! Come on!

32:37.797 --> 32:39.662
Hey, he was kidding!

32:40.199 --> 32:44.966
Everything I've ever dreamed of,
hoped for or longed for...

32:45.471 --> 32:47.769
everything deep inside me...

32:47.940 --> 32:49.771
here in my heart.

32:49.942 --> 32:51.807
She's everything.

32:52.945 --> 32:55.812
"And so the handsome prince
stepped out from the trees...

32:55.982 --> 33:00.214
and looked up at the tiny window
at the top of the tall, tall tower...

33:00.386 --> 33:02.946
that had no door.

33:03.122 --> 33:08.321
'Rapunzel, Rapunzel, ' he called.
'Let down your hair.'

33:08.528 --> 33:11.224
And thinking it was the old witch...

33:11.397 --> 33:14.366
Rapunzel let down her hair.

33:14.534 --> 33:16.798
Long, shining, golden hair...

33:16.969 --> 33:22.202
all the way down, down, down
to the ground."

33:23.509 --> 33:25.374
And...

33:28.247 --> 33:32.308
- And then...
- The prince climbed up.

33:33.519 --> 33:36.579
Just as he had seen the old witch do.

33:36.756 --> 33:40.556
"But when he came to the window,
Rapunzel stepped back in fear.

33:40.726 --> 33:42.387
Oh, my, she was scared.

33:42.562 --> 33:46.498
She had never seen a man before."

33:48.868 --> 33:52.099
Oh, yes, some of you boys can laugh.

33:52.271 --> 33:55.001
But his face was so nice...

33:55.174 --> 33:58.041
and his eyes were so kind...

33:58.845 --> 34:02.337
and his voice was so gentle.

34:07.119 --> 34:08.347
Quiet!

36:36.168 --> 36:38.728
Oh, no, it's Mr. Warner.

36:41.407 --> 36:43.568
Never have I heard such a commotion!

36:44.343 --> 36:48.473
Where on earth do you think you are,
a fairground?

36:50.116 --> 36:52.414
Come here, boy.

36:56.188 --> 36:57.917
Put out your hands.

37:00.092 --> 37:01.389
Mr. Warner.

37:02.028 --> 37:03.689
One word...

37:04.330 --> 37:09.199
one sound, that's all.
One further sound from any one of you...

37:11.003 --> 37:12.664
and...

37:25.017 --> 37:29.147
And tonight I want you to study your
spelling because you missed that word.

37:29.321 --> 37:32.188
- Spell "blue."
- B-L-U-E.

37:32.358 --> 37:34.485
All right, now you study.
Good afternoon.

37:34.660 --> 37:35.922
Bye.

37:42.401 --> 37:44.164
Hello.

37:44.737 --> 37:46.136
Hello.

37:48.040 --> 37:50.065
I hope you don't mind...

37:50.543 --> 37:53.011
but I had to see you again,
Miss Everson.

37:53.179 --> 37:55.340
I don't mind.

37:55.514 --> 37:57.209
I thought maybe a little drive?

37:58.117 --> 38:00.210
I could take you home.

38:01.353 --> 38:02.980
That would be very nice.

38:03.155 --> 38:05.248
Your carriage awaits, madame.

38:11.630 --> 38:13.257
I haven't offended you, I hope.

38:17.736 --> 38:20.569
I'm not very at ease with people.

38:20.739 --> 38:22.570
Men, I mean.

38:23.042 --> 38:26.534
That's all right, honey.
I got enough moxie for both of us.

38:33.586 --> 38:36.214
You won't tell lies, will you?

38:38.591 --> 38:40.286
Arthur?

38:40.459 --> 38:42.552
Not if I can help it.

38:49.268 --> 38:51.202
And you're not married, are you?

38:51.370 --> 38:53.099
Do I look like a married man?

38:53.272 --> 38:55.763
I even got a hole in my sock.

39:02.214 --> 39:03.647
Sometimes...

39:05.818 --> 39:09.618
- What's the matter?
- I feel as if I'm suffocating in this house.

39:09.788 --> 39:12.552
I don't feel I can stick
it out much longer.

39:13.993 --> 39:16.052
I know what you mean.

39:16.795 --> 39:18.956
Oh, they're good, my family, really.

39:19.131 --> 39:21.531
They're good. It's just that...

39:21.800 --> 39:23.563
since my mother died...

39:23.736 --> 39:27.194
things aren't the same anymore,
and we're all very different...

39:27.373 --> 39:28.738
from each other.

39:32.811 --> 39:35.644
It's hard to believe
that fella's your brother.

39:35.814 --> 39:37.145
Really? In what way?

39:38.584 --> 39:41.747
Well, there's something delicate
about you, Eileen.

39:41.921 --> 39:44.219
I mean, it's not...
It's...

39:45.658 --> 39:49.025
I don't know how to say it.
It's something hesitating.

39:51.197 --> 39:53.927
Not in that way. It's more like...

39:54.500 --> 39:57.094
I don't know.
It's not any one thing.

39:57.670 --> 39:59.865
It's everything all together.

40:01.040 --> 40:03.531
Especially when you look sideways.

40:04.076 --> 40:05.771
Do I look sideways?

40:05.945 --> 40:08.812
Oh, no. I mean, not exactly sideways.
No, I mean...

40:08.981 --> 40:12.280
you ain't got a squint or anything.
You don't see two of me.

40:12.451 --> 40:15.443
But I wouldn't mind seeing two of you.
My wife says...

40:20.192 --> 40:21.659
Arthur.

40:23.495 --> 40:25.725
God rest her soul.

40:28.400 --> 40:29.697
Arthur.

40:31.170 --> 40:33.832
That's why I hate motorcycles.

40:35.074 --> 40:36.371
You mean...?

40:37.509 --> 40:41.172
Oh, God. When I think about it...

40:41.647 --> 40:44.047
It was three years ago last...

40:44.350 --> 40:46.011
Tuesday.

40:46.585 --> 40:48.849
The senseless waste!

40:49.255 --> 40:51.746
Her broken, young body.

40:51.924 --> 40:57.157
Arthur. Don't cry, Arthur. Don't.
Don't, Arthur. Don't.

40:57.329 --> 41:00.423
She was looking
in a butcher shop's window.

41:00.866 --> 41:04.029
She knew how I liked lamb chops.

41:04.303 --> 41:05.770
And then...

41:06.138 --> 41:09.301
this motorcycle, out of control.

41:12.745 --> 41:14.645
- Arthur...
- Oh, Eileen.

41:14.813 --> 41:17.407
- No, Arthur. No, l...
- Oh, Eileen.

41:17.783 --> 41:19.910
- Arthur, no.
- Oh, Eileen.

41:20.252 --> 41:23.380
This is the first time I've felt anything
since that day.

41:23.555 --> 41:25.182
No, I'm scared.

41:25.357 --> 41:27.723
I never...
Arthur, I never...

41:30.496 --> 41:33.192
Oh, Eileen, take the pain away.

41:33.365 --> 41:34.798
Oh, please.

41:35.467 --> 41:39.062
Take the pain away, Eileen.
Please. Please.

41:39.238 --> 41:42.332
I'll try. I'll try.

41:44.576 --> 41:47.875
I'll try, Arthur. I'll try.

41:49.281 --> 41:50.714
Arthur.

41:55.988 --> 41:59.185
Poor Arthur. Poor...

42:13.605 --> 42:14.867
Arthur?

42:15.507 --> 42:16.940
No, it's Dracula.

42:18.377 --> 42:20.311
Oh, thank God you've come back.

42:20.479 --> 42:21.912
You trying to be funny?

42:22.414 --> 42:25.747
- I thought you'd gone forever.
- I have. I've gone.

42:25.918 --> 42:30.685
- What do I get here in that bed of nails?
- I'll try again, Arthur. I'll try harder.

42:31.023 --> 42:33.753
I've even...
I've even put lipstick on.

42:33.926 --> 42:37.123
What do you mean?
You always put lipstick on.

42:38.163 --> 42:39.994
No, I mean, l...

42:40.666 --> 42:42.497
I put it on my...

42:42.868 --> 42:44.927
What, on your...?

42:49.641 --> 42:51.939
On your nipples, Joanie?

42:53.145 --> 42:54.544
Have you?

42:57.883 --> 43:00.113
You said you wanted me to.

43:03.655 --> 43:06.146
How'd you know
I was coming back tonight?

43:06.792 --> 43:09.454
I've been putting it on
every night, Arthur...

43:10.262 --> 43:11.661
hoping...

43:12.231 --> 43:14.495
praying that you'd come back to me.

43:14.666 --> 43:16.156
Let me see.

43:18.303 --> 43:20.134
Show me, angel.

43:36.789 --> 43:42.056
- Oh, I see. Still the same after all.
- No, Arthur. No, not the same.

43:42.561 --> 43:43.823
But...

43:45.564 --> 43:49.091
I'm shy.
- Jesus Christ, I'm your husband, Joan.

44:17.563 --> 44:19.463
You was listening.

44:19.631 --> 44:21.599
All the time.

44:24.069 --> 44:25.969
Oh, jeepers, Joanie.

44:26.138 --> 44:30.131
What lovely, lovely little rosebuds.

44:37.349 --> 44:39.078
Are they...?

44:40.586 --> 44:42.850
Are they as nice as hers?

44:43.021 --> 44:44.955
What do you mean?

44:45.891 --> 44:47.188
It's just something l...

44:47.359 --> 44:49.088
I felt it, Arthur.

44:50.195 --> 44:52.129
- Well, you're wrong.
- Arthur?

44:52.297 --> 44:54.197
Wrong. Wrong.

44:54.366 --> 44:57.858
May almighty God strike me dead
on this spot.

44:58.437 --> 45:00.234
But you have wanted to?

45:06.512 --> 45:08.275
Wanting to...

45:08.614 --> 45:11.174
is not the same as doing it.

45:17.923 --> 45:19.891
Tell me why you want to, Arthur.

45:22.761 --> 45:25.559
You know, I heard a true story
the other day.

45:25.731 --> 45:28.859
In a band, a dance band they were...

45:29.034 --> 45:31.696
this man and this woman singer, they...
- Arthur.

45:33.505 --> 45:37.566
Well, they gave the elevator operator
a $20 bill...

45:37.743 --> 45:40.211
to stop the elevator
between floors...

45:40.546 --> 45:42.173
and turn his back.

45:42.347 --> 45:46.010
- Why?
- So they could make love in the elevator.

45:47.853 --> 45:52.552
Well, then they are animals, Arthur,
and you know they are.

45:54.760 --> 45:56.193
Are they, Joan?

45:58.730 --> 46:00.595
Are they?

46:00.766 --> 46:02.290
Well, it's disgusting.

46:07.372 --> 46:09.340
I wish...

46:10.642 --> 46:12.542
You wish what, Arthur?

46:19.518 --> 46:21.281
I wish...

46:29.695 --> 46:32.994
- I wish I could play the saxophone.
- What, Arthur?

46:41.873 --> 46:44.068
What are you doing, Arthur?

46:46.244 --> 46:47.973
I was pretending.

46:51.984 --> 46:54.077
But what?

46:54.252 --> 46:55.742
And why?

46:56.955 --> 46:59.423
That I got my own dance band.

47:03.428 --> 47:05.760
Go and wash it off, will you?

47:06.064 --> 47:07.759
What?

47:07.933 --> 47:09.332
The lipstick.

47:12.037 --> 47:14.130
No, I won't wash it off.

47:27.019 --> 47:29.988
See, Joan? A little capital
and a little affection...

47:30.155 --> 47:35.855
that's all a guy needs. That's all America
needs, some capital and some caring.

47:36.261 --> 47:39.856
My own store, selling records.
That's where the money is today.

47:40.499 --> 47:43.468
But it'll be risky.
Wouldn't it make more sense...?

47:43.635 --> 47:47.571
You won't let me down, will you?
You said. You promised.

47:47.773 --> 47:50.799
Oh, no, I've agreed.
You can use Daddy's money.

47:50.976 --> 47:55.140
It's amazing what a bit of lipstick will do
in the right place, eh, Joanie?

47:55.313 --> 47:56.337
Yes.

47:57.049 --> 47:59.711
You won't regret it.
I won't walk out on you again.

47:59.885 --> 48:03.719
I love you, Joan.
I really do love you, doll.

48:59.878 --> 49:01.846
What'd you say?

49:04.182 --> 49:05.809
Nothing, Arthur.

49:14.526 --> 49:17.518
I got the biggest turkey. It was so great.

49:17.863 --> 49:21.264
- Bye, Miss Everson. Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

49:21.867 --> 49:24.802
- Bye, Miss Everson. I'll see you Monday.
- Steady, there.

49:24.970 --> 49:27.564
- Sorry, sir. I...
- Look where you're going, boy.

49:27.739 --> 49:29.001
Yes, sir.

49:37.816 --> 49:39.249
That one.

49:40.786 --> 49:42.151
I haven't looked at it...

49:42.888 --> 49:45.220
I mean, looked at it...

49:45.390 --> 49:48.655
for almost 30 years,
when I taught this class.

49:50.996 --> 49:53.396
January, snowing.

49:53.565 --> 49:55.760
February, rain.

49:56.101 --> 49:58.865
March, with winds a-blowing.

49:59.371 --> 50:01.532
April, sun again.

50:04.643 --> 50:07.168
May, a world of flowers.

50:08.046 --> 50:10.207
June, with dancing leaves.

50:11.283 --> 50:13.774
July, long, lazy hours...

50:13.952 --> 50:17.752
Dr. Bartholomen
is on the school board, isn't he?

50:22.227 --> 50:25.458
He's told you about my condition,
hasn't he?

50:28.767 --> 50:34.364
He asked me to contemplate the picture
of Miss Everson, the teacher...

50:34.606 --> 50:37.166
and her illegitimate baby.

50:38.643 --> 50:39.905
Yes.

50:49.187 --> 50:53.283
I am not, I hope,
a blasphemous man, Eileen...

50:53.959 --> 51:00.091
but I often think the picture of Eve we are
given in Genesis is not altogether a fair one.

51:00.265 --> 51:02.733
Indeed, when I look about...

51:06.638 --> 51:09.505
and even into my own heart...

51:10.175 --> 51:15.909
I think it is much, much more likely
it was Adam who offered the fruit to Eve.

51:16.748 --> 51:18.045
Yes.

51:33.298 --> 51:37.667
Please, do you think I could stay
until the end of the month?

51:59.491 --> 52:02.892
- Please don't be offended.
- No, don't do that.

52:03.295 --> 52:07.425
It's a very hard world out there. You'll
need more than you think. Now, please.

52:07.599 --> 52:09.999
Please be sensible.

52:10.669 --> 52:12.000
Take it.

52:15.273 --> 52:17.104
Mr. Warner...

52:19.511 --> 52:21.945
I'll always remember this.

52:23.815 --> 52:26.409
Good afternoon, my dear.

52:31.189 --> 52:32.952
Oh, Arthur.

52:33.224 --> 52:34.224
Where are you?

52:53.008 --> 52:55.875
Come on, come on.
Where are they all?

53:42.291 --> 53:43.815
What am I doing?

53:46.929 --> 53:48.897
What am I doing?

54:30.906 --> 54:32.897
Good afternoon, miss.

54:34.309 --> 54:36.140
Who's there?

54:36.311 --> 54:38.302
No, you don't know me. I...

54:41.316 --> 54:43.011
Is anything the matter?

54:43.652 --> 54:45.210
Nothing's the matter.

54:45.821 --> 54:47.118
What do you want?

54:47.956 --> 54:52.325
My car's just down the road there.
See it? I just stopped for a rest.

54:56.231 --> 54:58.722
You can't see, can you?

54:59.101 --> 55:01.035
Not really.

55:01.203 --> 55:02.500
No.

55:10.712 --> 55:12.646
Isn't it dangerous...

55:14.149 --> 55:15.912
walking like this?

55:18.153 --> 55:20.917
- I mean, this ground is...
- No. I come here every day.

55:21.190 --> 55:22.919
I know my way.

55:25.360 --> 55:27.453
Oh, you live near, do you, miss?

55:27.629 --> 55:28.960
The house over there...

55:29.131 --> 55:31.031
behind the bridge.

55:31.900 --> 55:34.164
Do you need someone to walk
with you, miss?

55:34.336 --> 55:36.896
- That's very kind, but l...
- It's no bother.

55:37.272 --> 55:39.263
I'm driving from Chicago to Galena...

55:39.441 --> 55:42.535
and I could do with
a stretch of the legs.

55:42.711 --> 55:44.110
Be a privilege.

55:46.481 --> 55:48.381
No, thank you.

55:48.684 --> 55:49.912
Goodbye.

56:05.734 --> 56:07.292
I'll never forget this.

56:08.637 --> 56:10.002
Not ever.

56:11.840 --> 56:15.003
I think you're the most beautiful
young lady I've ever seen!

56:17.246 --> 56:19.510
Please excuse me saying that.

56:20.449 --> 56:21.882
I couldn't help it.

56:27.222 --> 56:29.019
Take care!

56:31.326 --> 56:33.556
Take good care of yourself.

56:39.001 --> 56:41.231
I haven't been able to get down this way.

56:41.403 --> 56:42.768
Business, you know.

56:42.938 --> 56:44.235
Why not, Arthur?

56:45.907 --> 56:48.205
Don't let's talk like this, Eileen.

56:48.377 --> 56:50.504
What way shall we talk, then, Arthur?

56:50.679 --> 56:52.647
I don't want to talk at all.

56:53.515 --> 56:55.244
What do you want to do, Arthur?

56:55.417 --> 56:56.679
Kiss you.

56:59.588 --> 57:01.180
Is that all?

57:01.823 --> 57:04.951
- To tell you the truth, I haven't stopped...
- Yes, the truth.

57:05.127 --> 57:06.958
Please tell me the truth.

57:07.629 --> 57:10.097
Are you married, Arthur?

57:10.732 --> 57:14.190
What do you want to go
and ask me that for?

57:21.543 --> 57:23.773
Do you think you could make us
a cup of...?

57:23.945 --> 57:26.778
Don't you do that, or you'll set me off.

57:28.884 --> 57:31.444
What have you got to cry about, Arthur?

57:34.523 --> 57:38.584
I don't know,
but it feels like everything.

57:38.760 --> 57:40.318
I'm going to have a baby.

57:44.599 --> 57:46.726
How do you know?

57:47.336 --> 57:49.327
I mean, is that definite?

57:50.105 --> 57:52.039
Quite definite.

57:55.844 --> 57:57.436
What are you gonna do?

57:58.146 --> 58:00.740
There's nothing very much I can do.

58:01.616 --> 58:04.779
- What are you going to do?
- Me?

58:07.656 --> 58:11.786
- What the hell am I going to do?
- You can write down your address.

58:12.761 --> 58:15.821
- What?
- Don't worry, I won't mess you up.

58:21.236 --> 58:25.002
- I've lost my job and I've got to leave home.
- Oh, god.

58:25.173 --> 58:26.800
Oh, Christ.

58:27.008 --> 58:29.533
And if I really do need help...

58:31.813 --> 58:33.246
Arthur...

58:33.415 --> 58:34.939
won't you?

58:56.738 --> 58:58.729
I'll do what I can, Eileen.

59:02.277 --> 59:04.336
I believed you, Arthur.

59:04.913 --> 59:06.244
Silly me.

59:06.415 --> 59:08.349
I believed myself.

59:08.950 --> 59:10.645
Yes, I know you did.

59:12.621 --> 59:14.350
You mean, you understand?

59:16.091 --> 59:19.185
My God, I think you really do.

59:21.196 --> 59:23.289
I wanted you, you see.

59:23.899 --> 59:26.390
- Did you?
- Oh, yes.

59:28.970 --> 59:31.302
And you still do, don't you?

59:32.307 --> 59:33.604
You still do.

59:33.775 --> 59:37.108
- I still do.
- I never in all my life!

59:37.279 --> 59:40.771
I've never heard a woman talk like that,
just like that.

59:40.949 --> 59:42.246
It's not decent, is it?

59:42.417 --> 59:44.351
God, it's...

59:44.519 --> 59:46.544
It's marvelous.

59:47.389 --> 59:48.947
But...

59:49.124 --> 59:51.718
But what? But what, Eileen?

59:54.529 --> 59:56.394
But you went away.

59:56.565 --> 59:57.793
Yeah.

59:57.966 --> 59:59.627
So...

01:00:02.938 --> 01:00:05.031
That's that, then, isn't it?

01:00:13.582 --> 01:00:16.050
Say we was married, me and you.

01:00:16.852 --> 01:00:20.754
- If pigs had wings.
- No, no, just say we was.

01:00:23.358 --> 01:00:26.350
- Well?
- There's a story.

01:00:26.695 --> 01:00:29.459
- Mind if I smoke?
- No.

01:00:30.799 --> 01:00:33.359
- You want one?
- No.

01:00:34.169 --> 01:00:35.693
In a band...

01:00:36.171 --> 01:00:38.139
this man and woman singer, they...

01:00:38.306 --> 01:00:41.366
Arthur, what has this got to do
with being married?

01:00:41.543 --> 01:00:43.534
Just a minute. A minute.

01:00:44.646 --> 01:00:47.012
At the hotel
where they were playing, see...

01:00:47.182 --> 01:00:50.310
they gave the elevator operator
a $20 bill...

01:00:50.485 --> 01:00:53.283
to stop the elevator between floors...

01:00:55.357 --> 01:00:57.416
and turn his back.

01:00:58.527 --> 01:01:01.121
Do people do things like that?

01:01:02.464 --> 01:01:05.058
- Like what, Eileen?
- Well...

01:01:05.734 --> 01:01:08.134
make love in an elevator.

01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:10.260
You mean, like kissing?

01:01:10.639 --> 01:01:12.539
Oh, is that all?

01:01:12.707 --> 01:01:15.369
Oh, Eileen! Eileen! That's a good girl!

01:01:15.544 --> 01:01:18.377
You knew what I was talking about.

01:01:19.481 --> 01:01:21.142
Would you ever do that?

01:01:22.050 --> 01:01:23.813
What they did?

01:01:25.554 --> 01:01:27.579
Between which floors, Arthur?

01:03:37.652 --> 01:03:39.950
What are you doing?

01:03:40.655 --> 01:03:42.282
Who's there?

01:03:55.537 --> 01:03:58.665
It's only me, lady.

01:04:02.911 --> 01:04:04.344
Are you hungry?

01:04:06.514 --> 01:04:09.779
Do you...?
Do you want some food?

01:04:10.351 --> 01:04:11.750
Here.

01:04:12.954 --> 01:04:15.388
- You can have it.
- Leave me alone.

01:04:15.557 --> 01:04:18.219
Here, you can...
You can...

01:04:18.393 --> 01:04:20.293
- I was... I was...
- Leave me alone!

01:04:44.953 --> 01:04:48.445
- Has anybody notified the relatives?
- Should we get the ambulance?

01:04:48.623 --> 01:04:51.888
- No comment, boys.
- We gotta go to press in half an hour.

01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.652
Is there a suspect, sir?

01:04:53.828 --> 01:04:56.820
What was her name, lieutenant?
Nobody saw the crime?

01:04:57.298 --> 01:05:00.699
- What was the cause of death?
- Come on, give us an answer.

01:05:00.869 --> 01:05:02.598
Over here with the cameras, boys.

01:05:06.274 --> 01:05:09.402
Illinois 9-3-7-5-6-8.

01:05:12.147 --> 01:05:15.514
9-3-7-5-6-8.

01:05:33.468 --> 01:05:34.867
Lieutenant?

01:06:00.395 --> 01:06:02.488
Jesus Christ!

01:06:18.046 --> 01:06:20.014
Arthur, what is it? What's happened?

01:06:20.281 --> 01:06:21.976
I've seen a message.

01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:24.641
What are you talking about?
Where have you been?

01:06:25.954 --> 01:06:27.819
I gotta change.

01:06:28.356 --> 01:06:29.846
Gotta be good.

01:06:30.258 --> 01:06:31.623
Arthur...

01:06:33.194 --> 01:06:37.927
Put your arms around me, Joan.
Oh, God, please put your arms around me.

01:07:28.850 --> 01:07:30.078
Excuse me.

01:07:31.886 --> 01:07:33.148
Yes?

01:07:35.156 --> 01:07:37.886
How much is a glass of lemonade?

01:07:40.194 --> 01:07:43.095
It's been so long since I sold one,
I don't know.

01:07:43.564 --> 01:07:48.695
- For you, 2 cents.
- Yes, I'll have a glass of lemonade.

01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:50.269
Please.

01:07:50.438 --> 01:07:53.236
You sure you came
to the right place, sweetie?

01:07:54.042 --> 01:07:56.670
Have a drop of gin in that, honey.

01:07:57.278 --> 01:08:00.042
- Pardon?
- A nice drink for a lady, gin and lemonade.

01:08:00.214 --> 01:08:03.809
- Leave her alone, Tom.
- I'm only offering to pay for it, ain't I?

01:08:05.019 --> 01:08:07.249
The one's on the house, honey.

01:08:08.356 --> 01:08:12.622
Just drink it down and go home
like a good little girl.

01:08:21.469 --> 01:08:22.959
It tastes like poison.

01:08:23.136 --> 01:08:26.231
Then don't have another.
Some girls it doesn't suit.

01:08:26.407 --> 01:08:29.171
Never know what you like till you try it.

01:08:33.348 --> 01:08:35.111
That's true.

01:08:43.057 --> 01:08:45.184
What do you want to do to me?

01:08:45.426 --> 01:08:48.417
- You must be kidding.
- Then can you lend me 5 dollars?

01:08:48.595 --> 01:08:52.497
- Lend you? You are kidding.
- No. I'll give it to you back.

01:08:56.437 --> 01:08:58.268
We'll think about it.

01:09:00.341 --> 01:09:01.740
There's no hurry, right?

01:09:07.115 --> 01:09:08.548
No.

01:09:09.317 --> 01:09:11.376
Caught a little short?

01:09:12.086 --> 01:09:13.678
Sort of.

01:09:17.291 --> 01:09:18.519
Yes.

01:09:18.826 --> 01:09:22.227
That's nothing to be ashamed of, baby.
Not nowadays.

01:09:22.596 --> 01:09:24.258
What's your name?

01:09:27.435 --> 01:09:28.662
Lulu.

01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:31.136
That's a very nice name.

01:09:32.106 --> 01:09:34.301
I don't like it.
It makes me sound cheap.

01:09:36.044 --> 01:09:38.376
Nobody would ever say that, Lulu.

01:09:40.448 --> 01:09:43.008
Hey, come here. Come here.

01:09:44.085 --> 01:09:47.179
Now, look at that big,
fat whore over there.

01:09:47.955 --> 01:09:50.082
That's what I call cheap.

01:09:51.426 --> 01:09:53.951
Who are you looking at?

01:09:55.997 --> 01:09:57.692
You okay?

01:09:59.667 --> 01:10:02.363
- I feel a little sick.
- Here, take a chair.

01:10:06.841 --> 01:10:09.332
How much you had to eat today?

01:10:11.179 --> 01:10:12.407
Nothing.

01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:15.105
A girl who looks like you
shouldn't go hungry.

01:10:20.021 --> 01:10:21.818
You're very nice looking, Lulu.

01:10:23.791 --> 01:10:25.019
Thank you.

01:14:07.782 --> 01:14:10.080
What'd you come in this place for?

01:14:15.523 --> 01:14:19.391
Did you think some guy's gonna give you
a fin just like that, for nothing?

01:14:21.162 --> 01:14:23.323
- No.
- Nowadays?

01:14:23.597 --> 01:14:26.623
That's almost a week's pay for some girls.

01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:32.095
- Yes.
- I mean, you gotta give something back...

01:14:32.273 --> 01:14:34.434
in return, don't you?

01:14:35.009 --> 01:14:36.306
- Yes.
- I mean...

01:14:36.477 --> 01:14:38.035
Yes!

01:14:41.582 --> 01:14:43.812
I know how you feel.

01:14:44.752 --> 01:14:47.516
- Do you?
- I can imagine.

01:14:47.788 --> 01:14:51.155
I'm not such a bad guy
when you come right down to it.

01:14:53.694 --> 01:14:54.956
Are you married?

01:14:57.398 --> 01:14:58.990
Yes, I thought you were.

01:15:01.235 --> 01:15:02.634
Been around, haven't you?

01:15:07.241 --> 01:15:09.141
I've had dozens.

01:15:09.710 --> 01:15:11.871
So, what's all the fuss about?

01:15:13.981 --> 01:15:15.881
It's no fuss...

01:15:17.852 --> 01:15:19.547
baby.

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.319
Yeah.

01:15:21.489 --> 01:15:23.286
Get me another.

01:15:24.024 --> 01:15:26.492
You're not a tease, are you?

01:15:27.862 --> 01:15:29.489
A tease?

01:15:30.197 --> 01:15:31.755
Because I'll cut your face.

01:15:41.375 --> 01:15:42.865
I'd like another drink.

01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:48.172
Please?

01:15:49.583 --> 01:15:51.346
Certainly, darling.

01:15:53.454 --> 01:15:56.753
- Same again?
- Yes, please.

01:16:03.664 --> 01:16:05.996
Oh, Arthur.

01:16:08.836 --> 01:16:10.303
Joan.

01:16:11.205 --> 01:16:12.797
Joan?

01:16:15.009 --> 01:16:17.477
Nobody's buying, Joan.

01:16:18.379 --> 01:16:20.074
Nobody.

01:16:21.248 --> 01:16:23.239
I made a mistake.

01:16:24.618 --> 01:16:26.279
I lost all...

01:17:52.006 --> 01:17:53.564
Hi, sweetie.

01:17:57.478 --> 01:18:00.106
- Want a nice time?
- No, I like feeling miserable.

01:18:00.281 --> 01:18:03.375
Just around the corner, honey.
Show you a real good time.

01:18:03.551 --> 01:18:06.281
- Come on, baby.
- All right. All right.

01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:10.952
All right.

01:18:11.125 --> 01:18:12.387
Okay.

01:18:16.263 --> 01:18:18.128
<i>Eileen.</i>

01:18:18.632 --> 01:18:20.691
<i>My God, what are you doing here?</i>

01:18:21.635 --> 01:18:23.296
<i>Arthur.</i>

01:18:23.671 --> 01:18:26.299
<i>Oh, Arthur,
you are such a bastard.</i>

01:18:27.508 --> 01:18:29.772
Put yourself in my shoes, Eileen.

01:18:29.944 --> 01:18:31.912
Oh, I have.

01:18:32.546 --> 01:18:35.481
And I know I can't rely on you, Arthur.

01:18:36.183 --> 01:18:40.711
- Not for anything.
- That's right, blame it all on me.

01:18:43.824 --> 01:18:46.224
- Oh, Arthur...
- I know, I know.

01:18:46.393 --> 01:18:51.092
I can hear myself say things sometimes.
God, I'm a washout.

01:18:54.134 --> 01:18:56.227
What about the baby?

01:18:56.837 --> 01:18:58.771
What's happened?

01:19:04.445 --> 01:19:06.413
It's been gotten rid of.

01:19:08.582 --> 01:19:12.109
This guy paid to get rid of it.

01:19:12.286 --> 01:19:14.516
He bought me clothes...

01:19:14.989 --> 01:19:18.152
and now he says I owe him $200,
and if I don't get it...

01:19:18.325 --> 01:19:20.452
God, why is it so...?

01:19:20.728 --> 01:19:22.923
Why can't the world...?

01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:25.864
Because that's the way it is.

01:19:26.967 --> 01:19:30.767
But I want to live in a world
where the songs come true.

01:19:31.205 --> 01:19:34.971
There must be someplace
where them songs are for real.

01:19:35.709 --> 01:19:39.270
"Happy Days Are Here Again."
Is that it, Arthur?

01:19:45.753 --> 01:19:49.280
- Where the hell is this place?
- It's right here.

01:19:57.364 --> 01:19:59.764
- Phonograph records.
- Hundreds and hundreds.

01:19:59.933 --> 01:20:03.960
Any dance tune you can name.
Any good dance tune. I'll tell you...

01:20:05.706 --> 01:20:08.675
Dance tunes don't help, Arthur.

01:20:09.743 --> 01:20:11.608
What am I gonna do?

01:20:18.252 --> 01:20:20.345
Can't you go back home?

01:20:22.056 --> 01:20:23.523
No.

01:20:23.857 --> 01:20:26.485
I was already dead there.

01:20:26.827 --> 01:20:30.160
This way feels like dying,
but I can see everything...

01:20:30.330 --> 01:20:31.592
feel everything.

01:20:32.833 --> 01:20:34.824
Do you understand?

01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:37.159
Did you...?

01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:42.004
Did you like doing it...

01:20:42.543 --> 01:20:44.135
for money?

01:20:47.881 --> 01:20:50.281
It wasn't as bad
as I thought it was gonna be.

01:20:51.985 --> 01:20:54.476
My God, you're something.

01:20:55.489 --> 01:20:58.287
We're the same sort, you and me.

01:20:59.526 --> 01:21:03.895
- We ought to stick together.
- But I can't rely on you, Arthur.

01:21:04.064 --> 01:21:07.261
- Listen to me.
- I am, I am. Very carefully.

01:21:07.434 --> 01:21:11.302
I'll tell you, I'm choking to death.

01:21:11.472 --> 01:21:14.635
I should have hung on to you,
no matter what.

01:21:15.109 --> 01:21:18.101
I wanted my own record store.

01:21:19.413 --> 01:21:24.248
I know, I know. It's enough
to make a goddamn cat laugh.

01:21:24.418 --> 01:21:27.182
Arthur, you'll never be satisfied.

01:21:27.721 --> 01:21:31.248
- Not somebody like you.
- Don't say that.

01:21:35.863 --> 01:21:38.423
You're like the children in my class.

01:21:39.933 --> 01:21:42.595
But you're still sweet on me, ain't you?

01:21:44.738 --> 01:21:46.933
You still want me.

01:21:47.875 --> 01:21:49.536
Huh, Eileen?

01:21:51.278 --> 01:21:53.075
Tell the truth.

01:21:53.947 --> 01:21:55.847
Yes, I do.

01:21:57.651 --> 01:22:01.314
And I'll go anywhere with you
or do anything with you.

01:22:02.356 --> 01:22:04.415
I've burned all my bridges, Arthur.

01:22:04.591 --> 01:22:08.823
I'm not going home, not walking the street,
and I'll be damned if I go hungry.

01:22:09.563 --> 01:22:13.090
Lulu I am, Lulu I stay.

01:22:17.604 --> 01:22:19.663
So, what are we gonna do?

01:22:24.211 --> 01:22:25.838
The trouble is, I'm hard up.

01:22:26.513 --> 01:22:29.038
I can always pick up some money.

01:22:29.416 --> 01:22:32.715
- Now I know how.
- I haven't got my car anymore.

01:22:33.587 --> 01:22:35.282
We'll get another one, one day.

01:22:36.190 --> 01:22:37.487
What?

01:22:37.724 --> 01:22:39.419
Just go?

01:22:40.327 --> 01:22:42.761
Just go and leave everything?

01:22:43.263 --> 01:22:45.128
Just like that?

01:22:45.432 --> 01:22:46.922
Just like that.

01:22:51.271 --> 01:22:52.499
All right.

01:22:54.508 --> 01:22:57.443
Then let's get out of here, shall we?

01:22:57.611 --> 01:22:59.044
Yeah!

01:23:01.582 --> 01:23:03.777
Wait! Hang on a minute.

01:23:04.084 --> 01:23:06.484
- What are you doing?
- "Yabba Dabba Honeymoon"!

01:23:06.653 --> 01:23:08.382
"Me and My Shadow"!

01:23:08.555 --> 01:23:11.319
- "Dancing With My Shadow"!
- What are you doing?!

01:23:11.491 --> 01:23:14.517
- "On the Sunny Side of the Street"!
- What are you doing?!

01:23:19.867 --> 01:23:21.562
"Dancing With Tears in My Eyes"!

01:23:24.872 --> 01:23:29.138
- "Pennies From Heaven"!
- Wait! Not that one! Not that one!

01:23:29.309 --> 01:23:32.005
- Not that one!
- Get off me! Get off.

01:23:32.479 --> 01:23:34.777
- What's that?
- Don't...

01:23:54.134 --> 01:23:57.228
- He's dead, isn't he? Murdered.
- Nothing like that.

01:23:57.404 --> 01:24:00.862
Please listen. Your husband left his store
at close of business...

01:24:01.041 --> 01:24:03.009
went to a bar in the neighborhood.

01:24:03.176 --> 01:24:08.341
He was later seen by a reliable witness
to return to his store.

01:24:08.515 --> 01:24:10.574
Was somebody with him?

01:24:11.585 --> 01:24:13.712
He was with a young lady.

01:24:15.055 --> 01:24:17.216
Well, when I say "lady..."

01:24:18.792 --> 01:24:20.020
Go on.

01:24:21.061 --> 01:24:24.326
We've been piecing things together,
Mrs. Parker...

01:24:25.065 --> 01:24:28.034
and I'm sorry,
but this woman was a prostitute.

01:24:28.268 --> 01:24:31.203
- You mean, she went there to...?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:24:35.342 --> 01:24:37.333
He was like that?

01:24:39.346 --> 01:24:40.711
How do you mean?

01:24:40.881 --> 01:24:44.044
I mean, was he disturbed
in any way about anything?

01:24:44.217 --> 01:24:47.550
Was he odd, restless, nuts?

01:24:47.721 --> 01:24:50.554
Has he done something?
Is that why you took his shoe?

01:24:50.724 --> 01:24:53.784
Please think.
Was he acting strange in any way?

01:25:02.069 --> 01:25:03.866
He made me...

01:25:04.037 --> 01:25:05.902
wear lipstick.

01:25:06.073 --> 01:25:07.301
So?

01:25:07.941 --> 01:25:09.374
No.

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:14.838
On the...

01:25:15.949 --> 01:25:17.610
On the...

01:25:19.119 --> 01:25:22.486
points of my bosom.
- Oh, well.

01:25:22.656 --> 01:25:24.681
Well, that's...

01:25:24.891 --> 01:25:26.518
And...

01:25:28.261 --> 01:25:30.752
he asked me if I would...

01:25:32.265 --> 01:25:35.894
No, no, no, Mrs. Parker.
Please, please go on.

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:43.571
If I would stop wearing
a certain garment...

01:25:43.744 --> 01:25:45.371
a certain...

01:25:46.113 --> 01:25:48.013
item of underwear.

01:25:54.988 --> 01:25:58.116
Was this an upper...

01:25:58.759 --> 01:26:00.488
or a lower garment?

01:26:02.696 --> 01:26:04.527
A lower.

01:26:05.098 --> 01:26:06.565
What?

01:26:07.334 --> 01:26:09.097
Lower.

01:26:14.508 --> 01:26:16.305
Mrs. Parker...

01:26:17.010 --> 01:26:19.911
about six weeks ago,
can you think back...

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:25.245
your husband traveled back to Chicago
along Illinois Route 1.

01:26:25.986 --> 01:26:27.419
He...

01:26:28.989 --> 01:26:31.219
Oh, that must have been the night...

01:26:35.529 --> 01:26:37.588
I remember it now.

01:26:40.534 --> 01:26:44.402
He said, "I gotta change.
I gotta be good."

01:26:45.472 --> 01:26:48.839
He's gotta be good, huh?
The hell.

01:26:49.009 --> 01:26:51.273
Cut his thing off.

01:26:51.845 --> 01:26:55.713
I want them to cut his thing off
and bury it.

01:26:59.319 --> 01:27:04.188
- I'm sick of being poor.
- Hey, I'll find something soon.

01:27:04.357 --> 01:27:06.917
- Maybe tomorrow, huh?
- Yeah...

01:27:07.094 --> 01:27:09.528
maybe.
- Jesus Christ, Eileen...

01:27:09.696 --> 01:27:11.857
you're beginning
to sound like my wife.

01:27:12.032 --> 01:27:14.364
I'm not surprised, poor woman.

01:27:14.534 --> 01:27:16.263
What is it about women?

01:27:16.803 --> 01:27:19.465
Do your mothers teach it to you or what?

01:27:19.639 --> 01:27:22.802
I hardly ever knew my mother, poor soul.

01:27:24.611 --> 01:27:28.138
She worked her fingers to the bone,
and for what?

01:27:28.515 --> 01:27:32.918
Life with a stove and a washtub and...
Oh, what's the use?

01:27:35.522 --> 01:27:38.047
She was dead at 45.

01:27:39.659 --> 01:27:42.423
We only got one life, Arthur.

01:27:44.998 --> 01:27:47.728
And I was content with mine.

01:27:48.268 --> 01:27:50.759
I didn't even think about it,
just accepted it.

01:27:52.472 --> 01:27:54.269
But you changed all that.

01:27:54.841 --> 01:27:57.503
You killed off my old life.

01:27:57.677 --> 01:28:00.111
That's right, blame me.

01:28:01.014 --> 01:28:02.914
No, no.

01:28:08.255 --> 01:28:10.485
I'm glad you did.

01:28:10.657 --> 01:28:13.125
When you made love to me...

01:28:14.227 --> 01:28:17.355
I saw things differently.

01:28:18.064 --> 01:28:20.259
I had to get away.

01:28:20.901 --> 01:28:24.564
I had to see something else...

01:28:25.205 --> 01:28:27.730
something more.

01:28:28.408 --> 01:28:32.003
I want nice things, Arthur.

01:28:36.249 --> 01:28:37.773
You'll have them, honey.

01:28:37.951 --> 01:28:40.044
I don't want to wait.
There isn't time.

01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:42.780
- Don't say that.
- No, there isn't.

01:28:42.956 --> 01:28:45.083
I know there isn't.

01:28:46.459 --> 01:28:49.292
Don't ask me how, I just know.

01:28:50.063 --> 01:28:51.997
What's happening?

01:28:53.567 --> 01:28:55.228
Where are you going?

01:28:55.402 --> 01:28:58.200
Are the seams on my stockings straight?

01:29:00.073 --> 01:29:02.337
You got terrific legs, baby.

01:29:02.509 --> 01:29:04.739
Let's hope so.

01:29:04.911 --> 01:29:08.403
- Hey, what are you gonna do?
- Get some dough.

01:29:08.582 --> 01:29:10.174
Eileen!

01:29:11.117 --> 01:29:15.213
Look, will you listen to me?
There's enough to get an indictment.

01:29:15.388 --> 01:29:17.913
His shoe fits the print made at the scene.

01:29:18.091 --> 01:29:21.754
His fingerprints are on the cigarette pack
found at the scene.

01:29:21.928 --> 01:29:26.365
He said he had seen a message that night,
and he's on the run with this...

01:29:26.533 --> 01:29:28.558
This tramp.

01:30:15.415 --> 01:30:17.781
I'd like that baby one day.

01:30:18.351 --> 01:30:21.343
I'd like to have that baby, and then...

01:30:22.422 --> 01:30:24.185
And then what?

01:30:26.259 --> 01:30:27.851
I don't know.

01:30:29.596 --> 01:30:32.292
No, come on,
what were you gonna say?

01:30:32.932 --> 01:30:34.923
I don't know, except...

01:30:35.101 --> 01:30:37.934
Hey, you're not gonna cry, are you?

01:30:39.506 --> 01:30:42.634
There's gotta be something
on the other side of the rainbow.

01:30:42.809 --> 01:30:44.743
There always is.

01:34:27.033 --> 01:34:29.024
- Always the same.
- What is?

01:34:29.202 --> 01:34:32.865
Come out of the movies, the goddamn
world has changed. Goddamn rain.

01:34:35.375 --> 01:34:37.275
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

01:34:37.443 --> 01:34:40.412
Chicago song salesman hunted
in blind-girl murder!

01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:43.743
Chicago song salesman hunted

01:34:43.917 --> 01:34:46.613
Song salesman hunted
in blind-girl murder!

01:34:46.786 --> 01:34:48.185
Would you like a paper?

01:34:48.354 --> 01:34:51.653

01:34:51.824 --> 01:34:53.951

01:34:54.127 --> 01:34:57.096

01:34:57.263 --> 01:34:59.424
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

01:34:59.599 --> 01:35:03.399
Chicago song salesman hunted
in blind-girl murder!

01:35:03.570 --> 01:35:05.299
I'll take a paper, boy.

01:35:21.321 --> 01:35:23.585
You don't think I did it?

01:35:27.894 --> 01:35:29.987
No, you couldn't.

01:35:32.999 --> 01:35:35.263
What am I gonna do?

01:35:36.502 --> 01:35:39.733
- Go to the police?
- Are you crazy?

01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:43.407
- You're innocent.
- They'll hang me.

01:35:45.445 --> 01:35:48.039
I know what to do.
I'm gonna get out of here.

01:35:48.214 --> 01:35:50.045
Where to?

01:35:50.583 --> 01:35:52.448
I'll think of something.

01:35:53.219 --> 01:35:55.016
God, a cat!

01:35:55.722 --> 01:35:59.749
Goddamn, it was a cat!
It was a black cat!

01:36:01.761 --> 01:36:05.060
Goddamn, it was a black cat.

01:36:06.032 --> 01:36:07.966
I didn't see it.

01:36:09.369 --> 01:36:11.462
Maybe it was a rat.

01:36:16.576 --> 01:36:19.136
I'm scared, Eileen.

01:36:27.186 --> 01:36:29.120
See you, big boy.

01:36:30.556 --> 01:36:34.652
I always knew something terrible
was gonna happen to me.

01:36:35.762 --> 01:36:38.526
All my life, I've been waiting.

01:36:44.504 --> 01:36:46.267
Eileen.

01:36:50.610 --> 01:36:52.771
Are you running out on me?

01:36:58.451 --> 01:37:01.318
Well, it's no fun, is it? No laughs.

01:37:01.487 --> 01:37:03.478
But don't you love me?

01:37:06.259 --> 01:37:09.524
- That question...
- What about it?

01:37:10.930 --> 01:37:13.330
What would you like me to say?

01:37:14.333 --> 01:37:16.301
Do you, Eileen?

01:37:18.404 --> 01:37:20.304
Not when you are so scared.

01:37:22.675 --> 01:37:25.838
You mean, you'll stick by me
if I just keep smiling?

01:37:26.913 --> 01:37:28.813
Even with the rope around my neck?

01:37:29.682 --> 01:37:34.779
We've only got one life, Arthur.
We both know we made a mess of ours.

01:37:36.422 --> 01:37:40.119
It doesn't seem to matter much
how it ends, does it?

01:37:40.293 --> 01:37:41.521
Doesn't it?

01:37:44.297 --> 01:37:45.821
No.

01:37:50.403 --> 01:37:51.995
I love you.

01:37:54.273 --> 01:37:55.900
Yes.

01:37:58.044 --> 01:37:59.944
I want you.

01:38:02.014 --> 01:38:03.982
I want you now.

01:38:04.150 --> 01:38:05.481
What, here?

01:38:06.119 --> 01:38:08.019
It's the only way I can keep going.

01:38:08.988 --> 01:38:11.923
Besides, we ain't never done it in a car,
have we?

01:38:12.992 --> 01:38:15.517
We must be crazy.

01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:33.107
Come on.

01:38:34.147 --> 01:38:36.047
Come on.

01:38:39.051 --> 01:38:42.919
"Bargain," he said.
"Best car on the lot," he said.

01:38:43.389 --> 01:38:47.155
I tell you, Eileen,
salesmen got no goddamn morals!

01:38:50.329 --> 01:38:52.422
You have any idea where we are?

01:38:52.598 --> 01:38:57.228
We're in the middle of nothing,
just where I always wanted to be.

01:38:59.138 --> 01:39:01.504
We'll just have to stay here.

01:39:01.774 --> 01:39:04.208
Just stay here till they find us.

01:39:07.814 --> 01:39:09.611
Goddamn car!

01:39:11.951 --> 01:39:14.818
Kick it again, Arthur.
It didn't hear you.

01:39:58.264 --> 01:40:01.358
- Halt! Halt!
- Arthur! Arthur, don't!

01:40:01.534 --> 01:40:02.865
Halt!

01:40:04.704 --> 01:40:07.070
- One move and you're dead.
- I didn't do it!

01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:09.868
Swear to God, I didn't do it!
I'm innocent!

01:40:10.042 --> 01:40:13.102
I'm innocent! I wouldn't hurt a fly.

01:40:26.759 --> 01:40:28.624
<i>Arthur Parker...</i>

01:40:29.061 --> 01:40:31.529
<i>do you have anything to say?</i>

01:40:33.399 --> 01:40:35.924
A long time ago...

01:40:36.836 --> 01:40:39.634
a million years B. C...

01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:44.801
the best things in life
was absolutely free.

01:40:49.482 --> 01:40:53.441
But no one appreciated a sky
that was always blue.

01:40:54.787 --> 01:40:58.883
And no one congratulated a moon
that was always new.

01:41:00.192 --> 01:41:04.686
So it was planned
that they would vanish now and then.

01:41:06.198 --> 01:41:09.793
And you must pay
before you get them back again.

01:41:11.404 --> 01:41:14.771
And that's what storms are made for.

01:41:16.776 --> 01:41:19.472
And you shouldn't be afraid.

01:41:19.946 --> 01:41:21.470
For...

01:42:59.912 --> 01:43:03.040
Eileen! Eileen! Wait!

01:43:03.215 --> 01:43:07.015
Eileen! Wait! Eileen!

01:43:12.691 --> 01:43:14.556
Arthur.

01:43:15.327 --> 01:43:17.693
Arthur, what are you doing here?

01:43:17.863 --> 01:43:20.525
Whoever said you could stop a dream?

01:43:20.866 --> 01:43:23.767
We couldn't go through all that
without a happy ending.

01:43:23.936 --> 01:43:26.268
Songs ain't like that, are they?

01:43:26.705 --> 01:43:28.070
No.

01:43:28.607 --> 01:43:30.074
No, they're not.

01:45:00.032 --> 01:45:01.761
<i>I'm Arthur.</i>

01:45:02.601 --> 01:45:04.466
<i>And I love you.</i>
