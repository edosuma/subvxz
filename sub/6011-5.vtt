01:16.920 --> 01:19.309
I don't know why you always
wait for me. There's no need.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.870
Because I want to be the first
to greet you every morning.

01:23.280 --> 01:26.272
- Well, as I said, there's no need.
- There's...

01:27.440 --> 01:29.476
There's every need.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.597
And I will keep it up until you explain to me
what has gone wrong between us.

01:32.680 --> 01:34.079
Explain what?

01:34.600 --> 01:36.431
My life is perfect.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.160
And then, in the space of one day,
it is nothing.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.754
To me, that requires an explanation.

01:42.840 --> 01:44.273
Good morning, Miss Baxter.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.237
Hello, Mr Bates. Mrs Bates.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.231
I wondered if you'd help me.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.309
We will if we can.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.913
It's my sewing machine.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.149
I've no sockets in my bedroom,

01:52.240 --> 01:54.470
and what with the sewing room
being in the laundry wing,

01:54.560 --> 01:57.279
I wondered if Mrs Hughes might
let me use it in the servants' hall.

01:57.360 --> 01:58.713
I should ask her if I were you.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.995
Yes, of course. I'll do that.

02:02.960 --> 02:04.234
What do you make of her?

02:05.400 --> 02:06.469
I think she's nice.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.676
Which prompts me to wonder
what she sees in our friend Thomas.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.917
You know the old saying.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.036
"There's nowt so queer as folk."

02:16.480 --> 02:18.436
We'll miss breakfast if we're not careful.

02:22.360 --> 02:25.670
Are you happy for us
to be teaching Alfred to cook?

02:25.760 --> 02:27.557
It's Mr Carson you should ask.

02:27.640 --> 02:29.153
Ask me what?

02:29.240 --> 02:32.471
About the kitchen staff helping Alfred
to train for his test.

02:32.560 --> 02:34.073
He's been accepted for it, then?

02:34.160 --> 02:37.152
Not yet, no. But he'd like to be ready if he is.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.629
Oh, I suppose it's all right.

02:39.720 --> 02:42.598
Alfred is a hard worker, I'll give him that,

02:42.840 --> 02:46.150
- and if cooking's his chosen path...
- Good.

02:46.240 --> 02:49.391
I was just checking
I wasn't inciting a revolution.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.276
There we are, m'lady.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.911
Now, I think I've remembered everything but...

03:05.000 --> 03:06.831
I'll just stay here while you check.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.880
It seems perfect, but what's this?

03:09.960 --> 03:13.873
Well, I know Americans often
drink orange juice with breakfast

03:13.960 --> 03:15.473
so I thought you might like it.

03:15.920 --> 03:18.388
That is so considerate, Baxter.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.113
Thank you.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.068
- Good morning, m'lord.
- Good morning.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.354
You look very jovial.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.954
Just Baxter, reminding me of times gone by.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.309
You're pleased with her?

03:29.400 --> 03:30.753
I am, thank heaven.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.399
So, what's your day looking like?

03:33.800 --> 03:36.553
Tom and Mary have summoned me
to the library.

03:36.640 --> 03:37.914
They have an idea.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.592
I hope it's not something
you're going to fight about.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.034
Erm, how can I answer that
when I don't know what it is?

03:45.400 --> 03:46.719
So, what you're saying is,

03:46.800 --> 03:49.268
if we find a job for the boy
it'll make a difference to his mother.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.509
Oh, a big difference.

03:50.600 --> 03:53.478
If you really want to help Mrs Pegg,
this will be of more practical use

03:53.560 --> 03:55.198
than all the tea and sympathy in the world.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.391
- Well, I don't need anyone else here.
- I know.

03:57.840 --> 04:00.308
But would you talk to
the head gardener up at the Abbey?

04:00.400 --> 04:03.836
Or maybe to even old Lady Grantham?
She takes her garden seriously.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.115
You don't have to tell me that.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.632
I'm sorry. When's the funeral?

04:08.720 --> 04:10.517
Tomorrow. Will you go?

04:10.600 --> 04:14.275
I will. His forebears have been tenants
since the reign of George Ill.

04:14.360 --> 04:17.079
Be that as it may,
the rent's not been paid forages.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.515
We've served all the papers.
It's time to get on with it.

04:19.839 --> 04:22.354
You mean foreclose the lease
and farm the land ourselves?

04:22.600 --> 04:24.875
That's what we discussed.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.514
It's sad, though.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.068
After such a long time
in the hands of one family.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.230
The world moves on
and we must move with it.

04:31.440 --> 04:32.589
So you keep telling me.

04:33.960 --> 04:37.669
Talking of the world moving on,
I suppose you've seen this.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.353
"The engagement is announced

04:42.440 --> 04:45.796
"between the Viscount Gillingham
and the Honourable Mabel Lane Fox,

04:45.880 --> 04:48.519
"only child of the late Lord Osweston."

04:49.360 --> 04:52.238
Well, I must write and congratulate him.

04:53.680 --> 04:54.669
Now.

04:55.000 --> 04:55.989
Let me get on.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.431
But if it's electric, aren't you worried

05:05.520 --> 05:08.512
it's going to run away with itself
and sew your fingers to the table?

05:08.600 --> 05:09.874
I certainly hope not.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.554
- How do you operate it?
- With a pedal under me foot.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.313
Well, I don't think it has any business
in the servants' hall.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.197
But there's no socket in her room.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.635
But she could take it over to the laundry.

05:19.760 --> 05:21.830
Or better still, chuck it out altogether.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.639
Mrs Patmore is not what you'd call a futurist.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.473
I think I'd got there already.

05:28.640 --> 05:29.709
Anna?

05:30.200 --> 05:31.519
I've forgotten something.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.471
You must forgive me, Mr Bates.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.551
I'm afraid I'm keeping Anna too busy.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.074
Would you like to have a try?

05:49.840 --> 05:50.955
Anna?

06:02.400 --> 06:05.472
I don't know why you must be
so hard on Mr Bates.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.711
At least you know now, there'll be...

06:07.800 --> 06:09.153
No baby.

06:09.800 --> 06:10.915
No.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.918
Then can't you start to get past it? And...

06:14.000 --> 06:15.353
And, and tell him something?

06:15.920 --> 06:18.354
He'd know if it wasn't the truth.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.558
He sees through me.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.429
He can read me like a book.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.433
I wish he could read you.

06:24.520 --> 06:26.112
And take you out of this...

06:26.200 --> 06:27.952
Vale of shadows.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.075
Don't you want to be honest with him?

06:31.160 --> 06:32.718
Of course I do.

06:33.320 --> 06:34.673
But I know him.

06:34.760 --> 06:35.875
I know what he'd do.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.636
And I can't risk his future.

06:40.760 --> 06:43.433
Well, it's your secret and not mine.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.112
But I think it's a mistake.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.915
And you're sure you have
a feel for gardening?

06:59.160 --> 07:00.388
I am, your ladyship.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.318
I'm not a ladyship. Just Mrs Crawley.

07:02.440 --> 07:03.953
I, I don't know much now.

07:04.040 --> 07:06.600
But I'm a grafter... And a quick learner.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.758
I cannot make promises,
but I will try and find something for you.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.589
Thank you very much, your ladyship.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.920
Will you show him out?

07:23.720 --> 07:27.713
He's going to be so disappointed
when he finds out how ordinary I really am.

07:27.800 --> 07:31.076
You're part of the family.
That's how the village sees you.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.116
It's not how the family see me.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.359
Oh, I'm not so sure about that.

07:35.440 --> 07:38.750
Lord and Lady Grantham have always been
as kind as they can be, and I appreciate it,

07:38.840 --> 07:40.671
but I am not one of them.

07:40.760 --> 07:41.909
And that's the end of it.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.956
Lord Grantham admires you very much,

07:44.160 --> 07:47.675
but if it serves you to think yourself unloved,
then nothing I say will make any difference.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.279
I think that's rather harsh.

08:14.480 --> 08:15.469
Lord Grantham.

08:15.560 --> 08:18.472
It was a very good service.
Your father would have been pleased.

08:18.560 --> 08:19.959
Thank you.

08:20.360 --> 08:21.713
Do you have far to go?

08:21.800 --> 08:24.872
- I'm staying at Yew Tree Farm.
- Of course.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.232
Let us know when you're ready to leave.
There's no hurry.

08:28.320 --> 08:31.596
The thing is, m'lord, I...
Don't want to move out.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.114
- I want to take on the tenancy.
- What?

08:34.679 --> 08:35.828
I fit's still possible.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.438
I'm sorry to be the one to say it,
but I don't believe it is.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.636
The notices have been served.
The case is closed.

08:44.320 --> 08:47.278
You mean you want to farm the land yourself?

08:47.520 --> 08:48.748
That it's all settled.

08:48.840 --> 08:52.071
Mr Drewe, it's no good painting me
as Simon Legree.

08:52.720 --> 08:55.234
We gave your father a long time
to get straight,

08:55.320 --> 08:57.197
and left him in peace at the end of his life.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.594
He never told me about the debt.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.439
Or I'd have tried to help him.

09:03.200 --> 09:07.512
Because my ancestors have farmed
at Yew Tree since the Napoleonic Wars.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.351
Surely that's got to mean something?

09:10.440 --> 09:12.032
Hmm. It means a great deal to me.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.953
Then couldn't we talk about it, m'lord?

09:17.560 --> 09:18.549
Please.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.637
Come tomorrow morning if you wish.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.314
But I can't see what good it will do.

09:28.280 --> 09:29.713
Don't take it off too soon.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.677
Let it bubble for a bit, or you’ll taste the flour.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.159
So, is this enough?

09:33.240 --> 09:34.593
I'd say so, yeah.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.671
Now put it to one side
while you check your casings.

09:36.800 --> 09:39.030
Ooh! My, my. Something smells good.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.315
Alfred's making tarts
with an egg and cheese filling.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.550
Ah. Bouchées de Fromage.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.153
They could be tonight's savoury.

09:45.240 --> 09:46.912
- Do you think?
- I don't see why not.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.194
I'll fetch the eggs.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.309
Well done, Daisy.

09:50.640 --> 09:52.756
It's very hard, Mrs Patmore.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.717
I feel like I'm helping him to leave us.

09:54.800 --> 09:58.429
So you are. Which is just as it should be,
now he's decided to go.

09:58.520 --> 09:59.509
So what's next?

09:59.760 --> 10:02.558
We'll add egg and cheese to the white sauce.
If Mrs Patmore doesn't mind.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.119
I don't mind at all, Daisy.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.316
You can help him enrich the béchamel.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.469
Your ladyship. M'lady.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.710
Is that the afternoon post?

10:16.800 --> 10:17.835
Is there anything for me?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.468
There's just a couple for his lordship, m'lady.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.876
Were you expecting something?

10:23.960 --> 10:25.439
Not particularly.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.639
I haven't heard from Michael in a bit, that's all.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.472
I expect he's busy.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.592
What have you been up to?

10:37.680 --> 10:39.398
I was writing to Tony Gillingham.

10:39.480 --> 10:41.357
Give him my regards.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.992
Say we look forward to knowing
Miss Lane Fox.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.674
I am surprised.
I thought he was rather keen on you.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.636
Not for the first time you've
got the wrong end of the stick.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.750
Oh! I thought you were Robert.

10:55.840 --> 10:56.955
Is he back from his funeral?

10:57.120 --> 10:59.076
Not yet, I don't think.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.668
While he's not here,
shall we discuss his birthday?

11:01.760 --> 11:04.797
- Oh! Does he have a birthday soon?
- Fairly soon.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.509
Do you have any plans?

11:06.600 --> 11:08.750
Nothing beyond his favourite food.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.432
It's not a special one.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.909
Why don't we have a party?
To cheer ourselves up.

11:13.320 --> 11:14.639
A small one.

11:14.720 --> 11:16.278
That'll be fun.

11:19.640 --> 11:21.995
But Maley may have a candidate of his own

11:22.080 --> 11:23.479
that he wants to bring forward.

11:23.560 --> 11:25.312
So you do need extra help?

11:25.800 --> 11:27.472
Yes, I suppose so.

11:28.240 --> 11:31.789
The last boy went off
to a frightfully grand rectory.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.236
Then will you take young Pegg?

11:34.320 --> 11:36.117
He impressed me so favourably.

11:36.520 --> 11:39.557
I wonder your halo doesn't grow heavy.

11:39.640 --> 11:42.359
It must feel like wearing a tiara
round the clock.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.069
Will you help him?

11:44.560 --> 11:47.279
His mother would be very grateful.
And so would I.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.828
Yes, but your gratitude never seems to last.

11:49.920 --> 11:53.879
I've no sooner said yes,
than you come back with another request.

11:54.520 --> 11:55.509
Will you?

11:57.600 --> 11:59.716
Oh, very well, very well.

12:00.360 --> 12:03.272
But he'd better turn out to be
all the things you say he is.

12:04.840 --> 12:06.512
This came for you in the last post.

12:06.920 --> 12:08.672
Is that the letter that tells you
if they'll see you?

12:08.760 --> 12:10.955
- Yes, I think it must be.
- Well, open it, then.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.634
Oh, go on. Don't keep us in suspense.

12:14.920 --> 12:18.469
I want it so much.
I can't bear to find out I've not got it.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.278
Give it to me, then.

12:25.520 --> 12:28.193
Well, they are going to test you.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.315
They are?

12:29.400 --> 12:31.994
But, by heck, it's the day after tomorrow!

12:32.080 --> 12:33.479
They don't give you much time.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.996
Oh, this was posted 10 days ago.
It must have got lost.

12:37.080 --> 12:39.036
He'll be fine. He knows his stuff.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.156
Of course he does. Doesn't he, Daisy?

12:41.240 --> 12:42.673
He does, yeah.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.671
- What's this?
- Alfred's got his test. At The Ritz.

12:47.760 --> 12:48.988
I'm happy for you, Alfred.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.189
Anna?

12:51.880 --> 12:53.029
That's the gong.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.753
I shouldn't worry, Mr Bates.

12:58.840 --> 13:01.354
She's got ever so much on her plate.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.192
Haven't we all?

13:07.640 --> 13:10.757
I thought I'd get
an extra 10 minutes in, before the gong goes.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.512
You can help me with this.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.558
Sybbie says there's going to be a hurricane
any moment now.

13:15.640 --> 13:17.756
A hurricane? Really?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.194
In Yorkshire?

13:19.280 --> 13:21.714
So we're getting all the animals under shelter.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.313
I'm sure you are.

13:23.560 --> 13:24.595
Where's Nanny?

13:24.680 --> 13:27.319
Collecting some clothes from the laundry.
I said I'd stay with them.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.915
She's so much more relaxed
than our nanny ever was.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.355
My childhood wasn't anything like Sybbie's.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.039
Nor mine, God knows.

13:35.360 --> 13:37.112
Do you think she's having a good childhood?

13:38.360 --> 13:39.395
That we're doing well?

13:39.920 --> 13:41.990
I think you're doing your best for her.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.115
If that's what you mean.

13:43.320 --> 13:44.912
It isn't quite.

13:45.880 --> 13:48.348
Uh-oh. I think it's time for the hurricane.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.239
Whoo!

13:52.320 --> 13:54.311
Uh-oh.

13:57.480 --> 13:58.833
Bravo!

13:59.040 --> 14:01.873
She's right. I couldn't have done
better myself.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.996
Now, take them up
and say you cooked 'em.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.069
I couldn't.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.434
Well, Mr Carson can say it.

14:06.520 --> 14:08.636
And what are they supposed to do?
Hang out the flags?

14:08.720 --> 14:11.109
Oh, don't grudge him his success.

14:11.200 --> 14:15.273
I don't. I just can't see the
fun in a life chained to a stove.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.637
Are the savouries ready to go up?

14:17.720 --> 14:19.438
They certainly are.

14:25.720 --> 14:26.948
I say, well done.

14:27.040 --> 14:30.430
We'll be sorry to lose you, Alfred,
but I think you'll pass your test.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.192
Fingers crossed, m'lady.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.269
When is it?

14:33.720 --> 14:36.109
The day after tomorrow.
I'm going up in the morning.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.594
Our best wishes go with you.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.993
- I'm going up myself tomorrow.
- Oh?

14:42.080 --> 14:44.548
Just for the day, to visit Michael's office.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.596
I'll be back for dinner.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.193
All alone?

14:53.280 --> 14:55.475
I seem to be. I don't know why.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.228
How are you getting on with her ladyship?

14:59.640 --> 15:01.517
Pretty well, I think.

15:01.840 --> 15:04.434
You've done America and praised Lady Sybil?

15:04.520 --> 15:05.919
Have I not.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.470
You name it, I've said it.

15:09.560 --> 15:10.834
She'll be eating out of your hand.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.198
That's the intention.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.275
No enemies downstairs neither.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.078
That was Miss O'Brien's mistake.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.037
Nobody liked her,
so nobody told her anything.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.508
They don't like you much.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.518
That's why you're here.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.716
To rectify that failing on my part.

15:29.360 --> 15:32.352
Is it true you've moved into the house again?

15:32.760 --> 15:34.079
Mrs Hughes said so.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.953
It seemed easier when I was looking after
her ladyship as well as you.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.630
But she has her own maid now.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.990
Why not go back to the cottage?

15:46.280 --> 15:48.350
I haven't got round to it.

15:49.800 --> 15:53.236
Anna, if you're in difficulties,
I wish you'd tell me.

15:54.560 --> 15:56.551
I'm not, m'lady. Honestly.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.353
I've come to say goodbye.
And thank you for all your help.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.199
Just keep calm.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.396
You know enough to do well,
if you keep calm.

16:09.480 --> 16:10.708
Very good luck, Alfred.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.598
Is there anything I ought to know
about London?

16:13.680 --> 16:16.399
There's quite a lot you ought to know
about London, dear.

16:16.480 --> 16:19.790
And no time to tell it now,
or he'll miss his train.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.356
This afternoon, when her ladyship
comes down,

16:25.440 --> 16:27.237
I don't want any back chat.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.312
She must see everything is in order.
Everything neat and tidy.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.469
What's happened to your apron?

16:31.800 --> 16:33.392
Why? What should...

16:33.480 --> 16:34.708
Oh, my God.

16:36.360 --> 16:37.429
What's up?

16:37.520 --> 16:40.318
I must have caught it on a nail.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.392
And me other one's in the wash,
and her ladyship's coming down later!

16:43.480 --> 16:46.358
Oh, don't worry,
Miss Baxter'll sort that out. Give it here.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.429
Right!

16:50.000 --> 16:53.356
I thought you wouldn't mind
if Alfred rode in the front, m'lady.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.919
He's catching the same train.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.912
Of course I don't mind.
We all wish you luck, Alfred.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.274
I'm going to need it, m'lady.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.634
It's his first trip to London.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.189
How exciting.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.550
Exciting's one word for it.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.667
You want to reverse the foreclosure
and take the lease,

17:20.760 --> 17:23.035
but you still can't pay all the arrears?

17:23.119 --> 17:25.076
It doesn't seem a very enticing offer.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.071
I'll pay, and it won't take long.

17:27.160 --> 17:28.639
Even so...

17:30.560 --> 17:32.630
I'm a Yorkshireman, m'lord.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.354
This is where I belong.

17:37.880 --> 17:41.156
We've worked this land
in partnership with the Crawleys

17:41.240 --> 17:42.992
for more than a century.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.355
In partnership with the Crawleys.

17:46.640 --> 17:49.029
I don't mean to be impertinent.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.878
I do not hear it as impertinence.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.430
We have been in partnership.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.829
We're in partnership now with all our tenants,
or we should be.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.592
Then will you let me come home?

18:02.480 --> 18:04.391
I'll see what I can do.

18:05.480 --> 18:06.515
Thank you, m'lord.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.748
I'll be at the farm.

18:12.360 --> 18:13.395
Mr Drewe.

18:15.360 --> 18:19.797
I would prefer to report that you are prepared
to repay the arrears in full.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.113
I'll lend you the difference myself.

18:23.600 --> 18:24.669
You'd do that for me?

18:27.400 --> 18:28.719
It won't be less than L50.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.315
I'll send a cheque
when I'm sure of the outcome.

18:32.000 --> 18:32.989
You won't regret it.

18:33.720 --> 18:34.755
No.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.631
I don't think I will.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.999
Do you think young Alfred's got any chance
with this cooking thing?

18:46.360 --> 18:47.952
I think he's got more than a chance

18:48.040 --> 18:50.918
judging by what Mrs Patmore has to say
on the subject.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.198
Because I've got an idea that
might kill two birds with one stone.

18:55.600 --> 19:00.515
We'll be short of a footman any day,
and Mr Molesley will be short of a job.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.989
What say we deal with the
two problems together?

19:03.080 --> 19:05.310
- And solve both.
- Exactly.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.189
- But, would he do it?
- Oh, would he do it?

19:08.280 --> 19:10.840
When he's been mending roads
and delivering groceries?

19:10.920 --> 19:13.195
And lucky to get even that?
I'll say he'll do it.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.429
I hope you're right.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.272
I know I am.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.994
You might have talked it over with us
before you made up your mind.

19:21.080 --> 19:24.072
But I haven't. I told him we'd think about it.
That's all.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.991
Sounds to me as if you've come to a decision.

19:26.160 --> 19:29.118
If we don't respect the past
we'll find it harder to build our future.

19:29.520 --> 19:30.748
Where did you read that?

19:30.840 --> 19:33.593
I made it up. I thought it was rather good.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.428
It's too good.

19:35.520 --> 19:38.114
The one thing we don't want
is a poet in the family.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.076
Would it be so bad?

19:41.560 --> 19:45.678
The only poet-peer I am familiar with
is Lord Byron,

19:46.200 --> 19:48.395
and I presume we all know how that ended.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.072
So you'd let Mr Drewe stay on?

19:50.160 --> 19:52.628
Since he wants to repay the debt,
I think it only fair.

19:53.160 --> 19:57.676
Besides, he talks of the partnership between
the farmers and the family, and I like that.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.239
Well, I think it's splendid.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.595
Says the Queen of the Rebels.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.472
- Thank you.
- And you agree?

20:03.560 --> 20:05.710
Even though he has no right
to renew the lease?

20:05.800 --> 20:08.792
No right, legally, no.
But we think he has a moral right.

20:08.880 --> 20:10.552
It's a pity it should be Yew Tree.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.392
It would have filled a hole in the land
we're farming.

20:12.480 --> 20:14.311
You've managed without it till now.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.834
But you haven't said what you think.
Which side you are on?

20:16.920 --> 20:18.114
Well the farmer's, of course.

20:18.560 --> 20:22.109
I've not abandoned all my socialism,
even though it feels like it sometimes.

20:22.280 --> 20:25.033
In this one and only instance,
I am glad to hear it.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.435
When will you tell him?

20:26.520 --> 20:27.873
There's no tearing rush.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.076
We've a day or two to talk it over,

20:30.160 --> 20:31.479
and then you can tell him.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.279
It's strange...

20:48.360 --> 20:50.874
Standing here, next to you, in silence.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.238
Because I love you,

20:56.320 --> 20:58.356
I want to find out why you don't
love me any more.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.110
You'd think we could talk about it,
but apparently not.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.153
But I don't...

21:08.560 --> 21:11.677
I'm going into Ripon this afternoon,
to get some things for Lady Mary.

21:12.640 --> 21:15.438
If they miss me, I'll be back before the gong.

21:15.520 --> 21:16.669
Well.

21:17.960 --> 21:21.111
At least I know you'll be back before the gong.

21:24.720 --> 21:27.951
Uff. I can't get over the speed of it.

21:28.040 --> 21:30.429
I feel quite dizzy watching.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.511
I don't think it'll show.

21:32.600 --> 21:33.589
Show?

21:34.120 --> 21:36.554
It's better than it was before I bought it.

21:36.640 --> 21:37.709
Aw.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.279
Thanks very much.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.669
Her ladyship's on her way down.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.589
Another one roped to the chariot.

21:51.400 --> 21:54.790
I'm grateful for this job, Thomas,
and we both know why.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.559
But what's it all about?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.719
Well, there's going to be changes at Downton.
There's bound to be.

22:01.160 --> 22:02.559
I'm sure.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.352
So I want to know about any plans upstairs.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.909
Any detail, no matter how small.

22:09.440 --> 22:10.509
Understand?

22:10.920 --> 22:13.229
Did the other ladies' maids
keep you informed?

22:14.400 --> 22:16.072
Miss O'Brien, yes.

22:16.600 --> 22:17.589
But we fell out.

22:18.120 --> 22:20.475
What about Mrs Bates? Is she an enemy?

22:20.840 --> 22:22.751
She knows what's going on.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.472
No, she's not an enemy.

22:24.560 --> 22:27.472
But she's incorruptible,
so we have nothing in common.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.393
She's also silent.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.278
I shouldn't think I've had four words
out of her since I arrived.

22:34.280 --> 22:36.874
Just get them all to trust you
and tell you everything.

22:37.280 --> 22:40.078
Your ladyship, how can I help?

22:40.160 --> 22:41.718
I've come down to persuade you.

22:41.800 --> 22:44.951
I just don't see why it's better than an ice-box.

22:45.160 --> 22:48.232
Well, a refrigerator is more efficient.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.195
It keeps food fresh longer.

22:51.280 --> 22:53.316
We won't need ice to be delivered.

22:53.680 --> 22:57.798
But the papers will still be delivered
and the groceries and all sorts,

22:57.880 --> 22:59.632
or are we to stop that, too?

23:00.240 --> 23:03.516
Mrs Patmore, is there any aspect
of the present day

23:03.600 --> 23:06.194
that you can accept without resistance?

23:06.280 --> 23:07.713
Well, m'lady,

23:08.000 --> 23:10.912
I wouldn't mind getting rid
of me corset.

23:13.520 --> 23:16.318
You must do everything Maley tells you.

23:16.400 --> 23:17.549
I will, your ladyship.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.676
John is keen to learn, aren't you?

23:19.760 --> 23:20.749
I am, ma'am.

23:20.840 --> 23:22.592
Because there's always work
For a good gardener.

23:22.680 --> 23:27.037
You owe your place to Mrs Crawley.
She would not let me go until I'd promised.

23:27.120 --> 23:29.429
She would not relax her grip.

23:29.520 --> 23:31.272
You make me sound very fervent.

23:31.360 --> 23:33.954
Wars have been waged
with less fervour.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.270
Well, let's hope we win this one.

23:36.360 --> 23:37.395
Good day, John.

23:41.240 --> 23:44.073
Say what you like. But I know
you care about these things as much as I do.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.149
Oh!

23:45.240 --> 23:48.152
Nobody cares about anything
as much as you do.

23:56.840 --> 23:57.875
This is it.

24:26.680 --> 24:28.511
My name is Arsene Avignon.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.750
I am the sous chef of The Ritz.

24:30.840 --> 24:34.435
Today, you are going to make four dishes.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.194
Is that clear?

24:36.280 --> 24:38.236
Then if you have no questions, we will begin.

24:38.320 --> 24:41.153
In 1917, at our sister hotel in New York

24:41.240 --> 24:43.674
the Chef <i>Monsieur Diat</i> altered a soup

24:43.760 --> 24:48.197
made popular by <i>Monsieur Gouffe</i>
and the great <i>Monsieur</i> Escoffier.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.069
What did he do?

24:52.760 --> 24:54.432
He served it cold.

24:54.520 --> 24:55.555
Very good.

24:55.640 --> 24:57.039
Yes, it was eaten cold.

24:57.120 --> 25:01.671
Previously, the name had been a simple one,
Leek and Potato Soup.

25:01.760 --> 25:04.638
But what was it called now?

25:07.360 --> 25:09.715
- Vichyssoise.
- It was Vichyssoise.

25:11.560 --> 25:14.791
So, you all have the instructions before you.

25:18.440 --> 25:19.873
Please begin.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.954
Mr Napier.

25:25.280 --> 25:26.395
What?

25:28.040 --> 25:31.316
Hello, Mary. If I can still call you Mary.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.789
Of course you can. How lovely.

25:34.840 --> 25:35.875
What brings you here?

25:36.240 --> 25:37.639
I'm working on a government thing

25:37.720 --> 25:40.029
and we've got some research
to do in Yorkshire.

25:40.120 --> 25:42.793
I'm on a sort of reconnoitering expedition.

25:43.120 --> 25:45.475
- Lucky me.
- I was in Thirsk and I suddenly thought,

25:45.560 --> 25:46.754
why not take a chance?

25:46.840 --> 25:48.831
Well, I'm so glad you did.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.234
Let me give you some tea.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.875
I'll get them to tell Mama
and Papa that you're here.

25:53.960 --> 25:55.951
While I've got you alone,

25:56.640 --> 25:58.437
you've been in my thoughts a great deal

25:58.520 --> 26:00.829
since the whole ghastly business.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.149
That's nice to know.

26:03.640 --> 26:08.589
Which is why it's lovely to
see you looking so um... lovely.

26:12.480 --> 26:14.630
Hello. Lady Mary wants tea for four.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.758
I'll start again.

26:20.280 --> 26:23.477
Hello. Lady Mary wants tea for four,
in the library.

26:24.520 --> 26:26.636
It's not right, you know,
when you speak against Alfred.

26:26.920 --> 26:29.434
Oh, sorry, but imagine never
having been to London.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.669
- Dearie me.
- I've not been to London.

26:32.760 --> 26:34.273
And for me, it just goes to show.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.430
He may be nervous,
it may be a daunting prospect,

26:37.520 --> 26:39.351
but he's got ambition.

26:39.440 --> 26:41.635
It drives him, and I admire that.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.515
Good.

26:44.360 --> 26:47.272
Because I've got plenty of ambition
where you're concerned.

26:47.960 --> 26:50.235
Don't be so soft.

26:53.640 --> 26:56.393
So, what is this thing you're working on?

26:56.680 --> 26:59.319
It's all to do with the rural economy,
very hush-hush.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.876
Well, don't tell us if it's supposed
to be a secret.

27:01.960 --> 27:03.871
Oh, it isn't. Not like that.

27:04.680 --> 27:06.477
A lot of landed estates are in difficulty,

27:06.560 --> 27:09.358
and the department wants to assess
the damage of the war years.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.078
Are they likely to survive, and so on.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.479
And are they?

27:12.960 --> 27:14.029
Some of them.

27:14.520 --> 27:17.114
- It sounds rather interesting.
- It is.

27:17.480 --> 27:19.357
Interesting and incredibly depressing.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.796
Which places are you studying in Yorkshire?

27:22.080 --> 27:24.310
Well, that I cannot say.
It wouldn't be fair on the owners.

27:24.520 --> 27:27.114
But we have earmarked
the ones in serious trouble,

27:27.200 --> 27:29.236
and you'll be glad to know
Downton's not among them.

27:29.320 --> 27:30.878
Still, we'd love your opinion

27:30.960 --> 27:33.918
on whether or not we're doing
the right things, wouldn't we, Papa?

27:34.000 --> 27:35.797
We don't want to add to his labours.

27:38.680 --> 27:40.477
Where are you staying while you're up here?

27:40.800 --> 27:43.189
We haven't decided.
There's quite a good hotel in Ripon I know of.

27:43.720 --> 27:45.199
Nonsense. You must stay with us.

27:45.680 --> 27:47.830
- I couldn't possibly.
- Why not?

27:48.840 --> 27:50.796
Well, to start with I'll have my boss with me.

27:51.400 --> 27:52.992
- Who's that?
- Charles Blake.

27:53.680 --> 27:54.749
Have you ever come across him?

27:55.120 --> 27:57.714
- I don't think so.
- Of course you must both stay here.

27:57.960 --> 27:59.871
That way, we'll get the
benefit of all your knowledge

27:59.960 --> 28:01.393
for the price of a couple of dinners.

28:02.920 --> 28:04.558
What could be better than that?

28:09.400 --> 28:11.755
Well, Mr Nugent, you've done quite well.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.759
I know I can do better, sir,
if you give me a chance. I know it.

28:14.840 --> 28:18.071
You haven't chosen to make
your living in the kitchen before now?

28:18.360 --> 28:20.032
No. You see, my mother was keen...

28:20.120 --> 28:22.554
You have worked instead as a footman

28:22.640 --> 28:24.392
for the Earl of Grantham?

28:24.480 --> 28:25.754
I have, yes.

28:26.120 --> 28:28.475
And this has made you unhappy?

28:29.040 --> 28:30.359
I'll not say that.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.639
But I want to do more with my life.

28:33.560 --> 28:36.233
I see. Well, we have difficult decisions ahead.

28:36.320 --> 28:39.153
But don't worry.
We won't keep you waiting.

28:44.880 --> 28:47.599
It's good of you to let me
disturb your afternoon.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.069
You see,

28:57.720 --> 29:00.678
I have to get to the
bottom of what's troubling me

29:00.760 --> 29:02.716
and I believe you can help.

29:03.240 --> 29:04.229
I doubt that.

29:04.560 --> 29:06.755
The thing is, I know you can.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.599
I heard you questioning Anna

29:09.680 --> 29:11.398
about why she was being so hard on me.

29:11.480 --> 29:14.392
- But that doesn't mean...
- Yes, it does.

29:15.400 --> 29:17.311
You know what this is about

29:17.680 --> 29:19.910
and you believe she should have told me.

29:20.680 --> 29:21.999
Well, I admit

29:23.160 --> 29:24.513
I think she should have.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.918
But it is not for me to.

29:27.520 --> 29:29.511
- Then I can't stay here.
- What?

29:30.400 --> 29:33.039
I have been happy in this house,

29:33.120 --> 29:35.156
happier than I had any right to be.

29:35.680 --> 29:38.399
But that only makes my present situation
all the harder to bear.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.192
- I can imagine.
- Can you?

29:41.680 --> 29:44.592
Can you, Mrs Hughes?
Because if you can

29:45.440 --> 29:47.317
you will know why I have to leave here.

29:50.040 --> 29:51.519
My wife no longer loves me.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.635
The sight of me is torture for her,

29:54.720 --> 29:56.153
which is torture for me.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.869
If you will not let me hear the truth,

30:01.960 --> 30:03.518
I will hand in my resignation now,

30:03.600 --> 30:05.716
and be gone before she gets back.

30:12.960 --> 30:14.234
So be it.

30:18.720 --> 30:19.835
Wait!

30:20.880 --> 30:21.915
Where is Anna?

30:22.240 --> 30:24.674
She had an errand in Ripon.

30:27.280 --> 30:28.349
It's not true.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.070
Anna loves you very, very much.

30:31.760 --> 30:33.239
And I think the pain of coming home

30:33.320 --> 30:34.958
to find you gone would finish her.

30:37.040 --> 30:40.430
So I will tell you what happened,
to make you stay.

30:42.080 --> 30:45.629
And if I'm doing the wrong thing,
then I ask for the mercy of God.

30:54.880 --> 30:57.997
I'm sorry, m'lady, but they
said you wouldn't be in here before 7:00.

30:58.160 --> 31:02.711
No, nor would I be, but I left
a letter on my desk.

31:15.520 --> 31:17.431
Was anybody here... Oh!

31:17.520 --> 31:19.431
I say, has anybody else been in here?

31:19.680 --> 31:21.557
I don't know, your ladyship.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.315
No.

31:23.960 --> 31:25.234
No, why would you?

31:31.600 --> 31:32.919
That's all of it.

31:33.920 --> 31:36.559
You haven't said when it happened.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.234
Haven't I?

31:40.160 --> 31:42.515
Was it the last night of the house party?

31:44.960 --> 31:46.234
When she told me

31:47.720 --> 31:50.314
she fainted and hit her head.

31:53.880 --> 31:56.440
- Is that when it happened?
- Yes.

31:57.600 --> 31:58.874
Then I know who it really was.

32:00.120 --> 32:02.793
- I've told you who it was.
- But I don't believe you.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.639
I think it was Lord Gillingham's valet,

32:05.720 --> 32:08.996
who teased her and flirted with her
from the moment he arrived.

32:09.080 --> 32:11.719
It was not Lord Gillingham's valet.

32:12.400 --> 32:14.868
I don't believe he ever left the concert.

32:15.000 --> 32:15.989
It was not him.

32:16.880 --> 32:17.915
Do you swear that?

32:18.160 --> 32:20.230
- Why should I swear?
- You must swear it,

32:20.680 --> 32:22.352
on everything you hold dear.

32:22.840 --> 32:26.276
- Will you?
- I've said. It was an outsider.

32:26.360 --> 32:28.510
It was no one who was staying in the house.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.956
A man broke in and waited down here.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.759
- How many times must I repeat it?
- Do you swear?

32:35.240 --> 32:37.595
Very well. If it makes you feel better, I swear.

32:37.680 --> 32:39.318
- On your mother's life?
- My mother is dead.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.914
- On her grave, then.
- I've said I swear.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.639
Because I will find out who he is!

32:45.480 --> 32:47.118
You're welcome to try,

32:47.760 --> 32:49.716
but I don't know what you've got to go on.

33:28.880 --> 33:31.155
Ah, there you are.
How did you get on?

33:31.480 --> 33:32.708
Oh, fine.

33:33.360 --> 33:35.430
I hear Evelyn Napier was here this afternoon.

33:35.520 --> 33:36.635
I'm sorry to have missed him.

33:37.320 --> 33:38.753
Yes, he just dropped in.

33:38.840 --> 33:40.592
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

33:40.680 --> 33:42.511
Is he still in pursuit of Mary?

33:43.760 --> 33:45.113
I didn't ask him.

33:46.040 --> 33:48.395
So, will you be giving a birthday party?

33:48.480 --> 33:51.278
For Robert? Why?
Do you really want me to?

33:51.360 --> 33:53.635
I had rather a good idea for it, that's all.

33:53.720 --> 33:56.029
- Lf I did, would you give me a hand?
- Absolutely.

33:56.120 --> 33:57.269
Oh, Shh!

33:58.240 --> 34:01.755
So, have we come
to a final decision about Drewe?

34:02.480 --> 34:05.119
I suppose so.
If it means that much to you.

34:05.200 --> 34:08.431
And Tom's socialism will
ensure his approval of the plan.

34:09.600 --> 34:12.876
You laugh, but as a matter of fact
I've been thinking about it quite a lot lately.

34:12.960 --> 34:15.155
- About what?
- My beliefs, I suppose.

34:15.480 --> 34:16.799
I'm not too sure what they are any more.

34:17.239 --> 34:18.434
Since the house party...

34:18.520 --> 34:20.192
I won't hear another word
about the house party.

34:20.280 --> 34:22.793
Somebody said something to upset you,
that's all it is.

34:23.159 --> 34:25.230
What was this? Who was rude?

34:25.440 --> 34:27.112
No one. He's got that wrong.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.675
I just felt like an intruder.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.467
It made me face the fact
that I'm living where I don't belong.

34:33.560 --> 34:35.835
- Welcome to the club.
- Oh, stop moaning.

34:35.920 --> 34:38.275
But if you went back to Ireland,
Tom, would you belong there?

34:38.639 --> 34:40.676
No. I don't think I would.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.188
You've changed me too much.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.996
I'm a man without a home.
I am stateless.

34:45.199 --> 34:47.235
- Well, then.
- There is America.

34:47.600 --> 34:49.431
I have family there now,
and they're doing quite well.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.034
It would be a new start.

34:51.440 --> 34:52.918
But you've made a new start here.

34:53.120 --> 34:55.918
But I'm talking about the world
Sybbie will grow up in.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.356
Wouldn't it be easier for her
to begin with a clean slate?

34:59.440 --> 35:01.829
Rather than being the daughter
of an "uppity chauffeur"?

35:02.120 --> 35:04.111
Well, don't do anything in a hurry.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.599
We don't want to lose you, Tom.

35:08.120 --> 35:10.031
What do you mean you'll have
to think about it?

35:10.480 --> 35:11.799
What I say.

35:11.880 --> 35:14.189
I didn't mind helping out when
you were short-staffed...

35:14.280 --> 35:15.349
Oh, how good of you.

35:15.600 --> 35:18.797
But to accept a permanent
position as a footman...

35:19.280 --> 35:22.989
I am a trained valet, Mr Carson,
I am a trained butler!

35:24.520 --> 35:27.796
To accept a... My fall by taking a...

35:27.880 --> 35:29.632
Permanent inferior place...

35:29.720 --> 35:31.950
You keep telling me it's permanent,

35:32.040 --> 35:36.079
but from where I'm sitting
it's looking less permanent by the minute.

35:38.360 --> 35:39.759
I shall give it every consideration.

35:40.160 --> 35:41.878
Very generous, I must say.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.038
I will let you know me answer
when I have one.

35:46.120 --> 35:48.714
I shall wait with bated breath.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.397
Aren't you ever going to finish that?

36:14.040 --> 36:15.189
It's nearly midnight.

36:15.720 --> 36:18.473
- Someone has to do it.
- But it doesn't always have to be you.

36:32.040 --> 36:33.234
I know.

36:38.200 --> 36:39.713
I know what happened.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.870
Mrs Hughes told me after I forced her to.

36:45.040 --> 36:46.519
Then she was very wrong.

36:46.600 --> 36:49.751
- It wasn't her secret to tell!
- I gave her no choice, Anna.

36:53.160 --> 36:54.309
What did she say?

36:56.760 --> 36:57.875
How...

37:00.360 --> 37:01.952
How it happened.

37:03.880 --> 37:05.313
When it happened.

37:08.680 --> 37:09.908
I asked her if it was Green.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.039
- Who?
- Mr Green.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.679
Lord Gillingham's valet.
She swore it wasn't.

37:16.760 --> 37:18.079
No, it wasn't him.

37:18.160 --> 37:19.832
She said a man...

37:20.160 --> 37:23.470
Broke in and was waiting down here for you.
A stranger.

37:23.960 --> 37:26.520
- That's right.
- Because if it was the valet,

37:29.960 --> 37:32.235
- he is a dead man.
- It wasn't him.

37:32.800 --> 37:34.119
You only say that because you didn't like him.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.428
No, I did not.

37:35.800 --> 37:38.314
There's no excuse to accuse him
when he did nothing.

37:38.880 --> 37:41.872
Would I have sat down to breakfast
with him the next morning if it had been him?

37:42.920 --> 37:44.876
We can't know who the man was.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.153
We have no way of tracing him.

37:50.160 --> 37:51.718
Why wouldn't you tell me?

37:54.240 --> 37:56.515
Because I knew the suffering
it would bring you.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.079
Well, it's in the open.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.353
No more secrets.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.038
I'm glad of that at least.

38:08.120 --> 38:11.317
No more fear of being found out
because I am found out.

38:11.400 --> 38:13.834
My shame has nowhere to hide.

38:15.040 --> 38:16.393
Why do you talk of shame?

38:17.120 --> 38:20.237
I don't accept that there is any shame in this.

38:23.080 --> 38:25.548
- But I am spoiled for you.
- Oh...

38:26.280 --> 38:28.271
And I can never be unspoiled.

38:29.120 --> 38:30.872
You are not spoiled.

38:34.960 --> 38:37.394
You are made higher to me,

38:38.720 --> 38:41.393
and holier, because of the suffering
you have been put through.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.393
You are my wife,

38:46.840 --> 38:48.831
and I have never been prouder,

38:50.440 --> 38:53.238
nor loved you more than I love you now,
at this moment.

38:56.360 --> 38:57.918
Do you really mean this?

38:59.200 --> 39:00.315
Truly.

39:23.080 --> 39:24.752
- Morning.
- Morning.

39:33.880 --> 39:35.074
Alfred.

39:36.280 --> 39:37.395
Is that the result?

39:37.960 --> 39:39.234
Well, I think so, yes.

39:39.920 --> 39:41.592
Do you want me to open it?

39:41.680 --> 39:42.908
No. I'll do it myself.

39:43.600 --> 39:44.749
Good luck.

39:51.360 --> 39:52.475
Well?

39:53.720 --> 39:55.472
- I've not got it.
- What?

39:55.880 --> 39:57.279
Oh, I am sorry.

39:57.360 --> 40:00.193
It says I did well and I was
nearly in the top four but not quite.

40:00.520 --> 40:01.999
I expect they say that to everyone.

40:02.080 --> 40:04.389
That's enough, James. And Alfred,

40:04.480 --> 40:08.029
to fail at the first attempt does not
mean that you won't succeed later.

40:08.120 --> 40:09.235
Quite right.

40:09.680 --> 40:11.671
Might I have a word, Mr Carson?

40:11.960 --> 40:13.279
Certainly.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.795
Oh, well. I've given it a lot of thought.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.638
Have you, indeed?

40:25.720 --> 40:28.553
First I needed to deal with my
father's disappointment

40:28.640 --> 40:30.790
when he learned of my downward path.

40:30.880 --> 40:33.440
But I weighed it against the power to do good

40:33.520 --> 40:34.873
that all employment brings.

40:35.040 --> 40:38.191
Did you, now?
And you thought all that.

40:38.640 --> 40:41.154
I feel I could contain my skills

40:41.240 --> 40:43.196
and guide them into a...

40:43.280 --> 40:46.033
More modest channel without loss of dignity.

40:46.440 --> 40:47.793
Just fancy.

40:47.960 --> 40:50.713
So, all in all, and after mature deliberation,

40:50.800 --> 40:53.678
you will be pleased to hear
that I can accept your offer.

40:54.360 --> 40:56.749
- What offer?
- To replace Alfred as footman.

40:57.400 --> 41:00.870
Oh, dear, Mr Molesley,
I'm afraid that Alfred is not leaving now.

41:01.520 --> 41:04.398
Yeah, it's a pity you didn't accept the job
when we last talked,

41:04.480 --> 41:06.516
and then I'd have been stuck with you.

41:07.240 --> 41:09.310
As it is, you've missed your chance.

41:11.400 --> 41:12.879
As I generally do.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.751
Mature deliberation!

41:19.840 --> 41:21.319
Cheer up, lad.

41:22.400 --> 41:23.958
You read the letter.

41:24.040 --> 41:26.793
You were a very near miss,
so next time you'll hit the target.

41:26.880 --> 41:28.154
I reckon Jimmy's right,

41:28.240 --> 41:29.912
and they say that to everyone who fails.

41:30.240 --> 41:32.674
Well, I reckon you work hard

41:32.760 --> 41:34.398
and you deserve to succeed.

41:34.600 --> 41:37.194
You just have to stick at it, and you will.

41:40.760 --> 41:42.557
I'm not saying he took it,

41:43.240 --> 41:45.231
but I don't see who else could have done.

41:45.560 --> 41:47.471
In other words, you are saying that he took it.

41:47.560 --> 41:51.189
- I know he was in this room.
- Legitimately.

41:51.520 --> 41:54.398
Really, Dr Clarkson,
I'm not a witness for the Prosecution.

41:54.600 --> 41:56.272
- Aren't you?
- Well, let's just review the facts.

41:56.360 --> 41:59.033
I have lost a valuable paperknife

41:59.720 --> 42:03.269
given to the late Lord Grantham
by the King of Sweden.

42:03.880 --> 42:05.154
Which makes all the difference.

42:05.640 --> 42:08.518
It makes the loss greater, yes.

42:08.600 --> 42:09.669
I quite agree.

42:10.240 --> 42:14.279
But I can't accept there's any
real proof against um, young Pegg.

42:14.520 --> 42:16.988
Well, if you insist, I won't sack him yet.

42:18.120 --> 42:20.395
But I will not allow him back in the house

42:20.480 --> 42:22.994
and I will have to speak to my
head gardener about it.

42:23.160 --> 42:24.752
That will do him a lot of harm.

42:24.840 --> 42:28.674
Well, what would you prefer?
That I invite the local criminals to drop in

42:28.760 --> 42:30.318
and strip the house bare?

42:30.720 --> 42:33.553
Why not ask to be told when
a gardener is coming inside,

42:33.960 --> 42:36.554
so that you or a servant can keep watch?

42:37.000 --> 42:39.719
Then we'll have time to investigate
the loss of the knife.

42:39.800 --> 42:41.358
Or have you already scented blood?

42:41.760 --> 42:44.149
As a matter of interest, do you ever doubt?

42:44.600 --> 42:46.795
I don't doubt the honesty of young Pegg.

42:47.800 --> 42:50.360
That is not at all what I asked.

42:54.880 --> 42:56.757
I'm very grateful, m'lady.

42:56.840 --> 42:58.831
I know you didn't have to do this,
but it only makes me

42:58.920 --> 43:01.388
more determined to prove
I'm worthy of your faith.

43:01.480 --> 43:03.789
I can't pretend to take the credit, Mr Drewe.

43:03.880 --> 43:06.997
It was his lordship who was
determined you should stay.

43:07.080 --> 43:08.752
You owe your thanks to him.

43:08.840 --> 43:10.990
He'll have my thanks, m'lady.

43:11.080 --> 43:13.469
And he'll have the rest of the payment
before he's missed it.

43:14.240 --> 43:16.310
- What payment?
- The remainder of the debt.

43:19.480 --> 43:21.072
I thought you'd know about it.

43:21.160 --> 43:23.310
And so we do. Of course we do.

43:23.400 --> 43:25.550
I'm sorry. I was being absent-minded.

43:25.640 --> 43:27.119
- How much is it?
- I've forgotten.

43:27.200 --> 43:29.270
It's only the last L50.

43:29.360 --> 43:31.828
He sent a cheque so I can pay
of the full amount

43:31.920 --> 43:33.717
and wipe the slate clean.

43:34.040 --> 43:36.076
Well, thank you, Mr Drewe.

43:36.160 --> 43:38.833
I'm sure we have many fruitful years
ahead of us.

43:45.400 --> 43:46.753
Are you going to challenge him?

43:47.280 --> 43:49.510
No. If Papa believes enough in Drewe

43:49.600 --> 43:53.229
to lend him the money and to hide it from us,
then that tells me something.

43:54.680 --> 43:55.954
What exactly?

43:56.440 --> 43:59.318
That you and I are in partnership with
a very decent man.

44:04.680 --> 44:06.238
Mrs Hughes, can I have a word?

44:11.920 --> 44:14.718
I know you told Mr Bates about me
while I was out yesterday.

44:15.360 --> 44:17.430
He put me in a very difficult...

44:19.080 --> 44:21.674
I'm afraid he guessed who it was.

44:22.280 --> 44:24.032
- But you denied it.
- Denied it?

44:24.600 --> 44:27.034
I swore on my mother's grave it wasn't him,

44:27.120 --> 44:28.269
God help me.

44:28.880 --> 44:30.996
He seems to have accepted your word.

44:32.240 --> 44:35.312
In fact, I'm moving back into the cottage.

44:35.880 --> 44:38.838
Oh! Oh, I'm, I'm so pleased.

44:40.480 --> 44:43.552
At least if I'm damned for all eternity,
it was to some purpose.

44:43.880 --> 44:45.074
You won't be damned.

44:45.640 --> 44:48.393
Mr Bates has shown great generosity of spirit.

44:49.040 --> 44:50.314
As I knew he would.

44:50.840 --> 44:52.193
Eventually.

44:53.240 --> 44:56.073
So, we're going to try and put
the whole thing behind us.

44:56.840 --> 45:00.674
Oh, I hate to think of that evil man
getting away scot-free.

45:02.240 --> 45:03.832
But maybe it's for the best.

45:05.680 --> 45:06.715
I thought you'd like to know.

45:13.080 --> 45:14.308
What are you grinning about?

45:14.400 --> 45:16.595
What do you think? He's not going!

45:22.800 --> 45:24.074
Mr Bates,

45:25.360 --> 45:26.554
I'm so glad to see you.

45:27.880 --> 45:30.110
Anna's told me what's gone on between you

45:30.880 --> 45:33.678
and it's made me happier than I can say.

45:34.160 --> 45:36.071
To think it's all over and done with.

45:36.160 --> 45:38.515
Nothing is over and done with, Mrs Hughes.

45:40.080 --> 45:41.229
But Anna said...

45:41.320 --> 45:44.676
Do you think I would add to her burden
after all she's been through?

45:45.960 --> 45:48.952
I don't know his name, so I can't tell it to you.

45:49.680 --> 45:52.558
Not if you were to threaten me
with a knife, Mr Bates.

45:52.640 --> 45:54.995
I understand and I won't press you.

45:55.080 --> 45:57.753
But be aware, nothing is over,

45:59.560 --> 46:01.152
and nothing is done with.
