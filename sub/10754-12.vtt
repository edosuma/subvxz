00:10.451 --> 00:14.413
(Woman) 'You see, Dr Crane,
there's this man I'd like to go out with,

00:14.580 --> 00:17.583
'but he's 40 and he's never
been married.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.960
'Does that mean something? '

00:20.127 --> 00:22.588
It could mean he has a fear
of commitment

00:22.754 --> 00:26.341
or it could mean he's just been lucky.

00:28.051 --> 00:30.262
Marie, that was a joke.

00:30.429 --> 00:34.016
(Marie) 'Did I mention
I'm calling from a payphone? '

00:34.182 --> 00:36.476
All right, Marie, I would say,

00:36.643 --> 00:40.522
give him a shot,
but I'd keep that caution bulb lit.

00:40.689 --> 00:43.817
Thank you for your call. Who's next?

00:43.984 --> 00:48.739
lf someone's never been married,
it might mean they're a careful shopper.

00:48.905 --> 00:53.702
A divorcÃ© will bite into any piece
of fruit without squeezing it first.

00:54.911 --> 00:59.166
That was an unbiased opinion
from my unmarried producer, Roz,

00:59.332 --> 01:04.212
who, incidentally,
has squeezed more fruit than Tropicana.

01:07.424 --> 01:09.384
May we take another call?

01:09.551 --> 01:11.636
It's time for a station break.

01:11.803 --> 01:14.723
Then we'll be right back after this.

01:16.808 --> 01:21.771
- Didn't we just take a break?
- I'm parked at a meter. I'll be back.

01:21.938 --> 01:26.943
Do I have headphone hair? I may
have to flirt my way out of a ticket.

01:29.571 --> 01:33.950
- Are you all right?
- I got winded but I'm OK.

01:34.117 --> 01:37.954
- Ow! My ankle!
- Here, Roz, does this hurt?

01:39.664 --> 01:42.750
- No nerve damage.
- She should have an x-ray.

01:42.917 --> 01:45.795
- Frasier, the show!
- I'll get someone to fill in.

01:45.962 --> 01:48.631
No, now! You've got dead air!
Ow!

01:50.717 --> 01:53.511
- Take the shoe off.
- Oh!

01:53.678 --> 01:55.722
- Oh, dear!
- What is it?

01:55.888 --> 01:58.975
It's been a while
since our last pedicure.

02:05.273 --> 02:06.691
(Door knocks)

02:06.858 --> 02:09.485
- Who is it?
- Frasier.

02:11.195 --> 02:14.115
How were things
at the emergency room?

02:14.282 --> 02:19.120
Frustrating. You know how it is.
You're sitting there in agony

02:19.287 --> 02:23.541
and every crybaby with a gunshot
waltzes in ahead of you.

02:23.708 --> 02:28.421
- How was it after I left?
- Weird Bruce took over for you.

02:28.588 --> 02:33.426
That's quite a boot collection.
Why not put notches in your bedpost?

02:33.592 --> 02:38.139
Those are mine. You hate the way
I've decorated, don't you?

02:38.305 --> 02:42.393
No, no. As a matter of fact,
I admire your courage.

02:45.187 --> 02:47.231
- Is that for me?
- Yes.

02:47.398 --> 02:51.527
Freud said all we need to be happy
is work and love.

02:51.694 --> 02:53.988
Oh, thanks, Frasier!

02:54.947 --> 02:57.199
So you brought me work.

02:58.409 --> 03:01.537
Answering the fan mail
is something to do.

03:01.704 --> 03:06.000
Remember, this time,
death threats don't get photos.

03:06.166 --> 03:07.585
(Door knocks)

03:07.751 --> 03:10.004
- Who is it?
- It's Bulldog!

03:10.170 --> 03:14.466
- Pretend we're not here.
- Roz, you just said, "Who is it?"

03:18.095 --> 03:20.139
- Hey, Doc.
- Hey, Dog.

03:20.305 --> 03:23.726
Hey, Roz.
Wow! The whole place is a bedroom!

03:26.687 --> 03:32.401
- What are you doing here?
- I brought some deli.

03:32.651 --> 03:35.237
Nothing says "I'm sorry"
like fatty meat.

03:37.364 --> 03:41.910
You got pastrami, coleslaw...
OK, where's the French fries?

03:42.786 --> 03:46.123
I ordered fries! This stinks!
This is total BS!

03:46.290 --> 03:49.459
That apron boy is... Oh! Here they are.

03:51.795 --> 03:55.007
To think he does it all without steroids.

03:55.173 --> 03:57.926
- Shall I stick these in the oven?
- I'm not hungry.

03:58.093 --> 04:01.721
- Then you're not thirsty.
- Glasses are on the top shelf.

04:03.223 --> 04:06.601
- None for me. I'm off to the opera.
- You can't leave!

04:06.768 --> 04:11.606
- No ice cubes!
- Chip what you can off the freezer.

04:11.773 --> 04:15.610
- lf you leave, he'll hit on me.
- With a sprained ankle?

04:15.777 --> 04:20.365
It's like in the jungle,
they go after the sick and the lame.

04:20.531 --> 04:24.286
I'm meeting people at the opera.
I've got the tickets.

04:24.452 --> 04:30.709
Here we go. I'll get you more ice when
the feeling in my forehead comes back.

04:30.875 --> 04:35.922
Curtain going up. Roz, if you need
anything, call me absolutely any time.

04:36.089 --> 04:39.676
Except the next three hours.
I'm at the opera.

04:39.843 --> 04:41.886
No, four hours. It's Wagner.

04:42.929 --> 04:46.641
Then I've got a late supper,
bed, an early squash game.

04:46.808 --> 04:51.020
Call me absolutely any time
after 4:00 tomorrow afternoon.

04:53.940 --> 04:58.194
Hey, this is nice, you and me
having a drink together.

04:59.570 --> 05:02.031
Yeah, it's been fun. Bye.

05:03.241 --> 05:07.704
- Why did you paint only two toenails?
- It hurts when I reach.

05:07.870 --> 05:11.416
- You want me to finish them?
- No, please. It's OK.

05:11.582 --> 05:15.837
- Nice colour. Goes with the bruise.
- Bulldog, stop it!

05:16.003 --> 05:21.008
- You've got nice feet.
- You don't think they're too big?

05:21.175 --> 05:24.762
I could get this whole thing
in my mouth, easy.

05:31.227 --> 05:34.855
It's really nice to do all this for me.

05:35.022 --> 05:37.608
Kind of surreal, but nice.

05:37.775 --> 05:41.362
I figure if I'm nice to you,
maybe you'll be nice to me.

05:41.529 --> 05:45.616
I knew it! You come over here
acting all sympathetic,

05:45.783 --> 05:49.745
but you're the same horny,
low-class slime ball as ever!

05:49.912 --> 05:53.791
Hey, before you say something
that offends me...

05:53.958 --> 05:56.377
Look, all I wanted to ask you

05:56.544 --> 06:00.381
is if you'd be interested
in producing my show.

06:00.548 --> 06:03.425
- What?
- I'm not crazy about my producer.

06:03.592 --> 06:06.053
Let's face it, you're the best.

06:06.220 --> 06:09.765
- You think so?
- That goes without saying.

06:09.932 --> 06:12.518
Frasier goes without saying it.

06:12.685 --> 06:16.730
Don't answer now.
Take your time and think about it.

06:16.897 --> 06:20.150
But I warn you - when I set my mind
on something, I get it.

06:21.151 --> 06:26.365
I once wanted to interview George
Foreman. He said "no", but I got him.

06:26.532 --> 06:30.202
I had to paint his toenails four times,
but I got him.

06:32.788 --> 06:38.001
Your bandage has been too tight.
Keep the blood flowing to the ligaments.

06:38.168 --> 06:43.006
That feels great. Whatever Frasier
is paying you, it's not enough.

06:43.173 --> 06:47.135
Actually, I'd need a raise
to get me to "not enough".

06:48.470 --> 06:51.056
- Hey, Roz.
- Hey. What's going on?

06:51.223 --> 06:57.104
- Niles bought me some new shoes.
- Oh, yes, look: they have tassels.

06:58.939 --> 07:03.235
Aren't they exquisite?
They were individually handmade

07:03.402 --> 07:05.570
by an artisan near Florence.

07:06.738 --> 07:11.701
He is a hero there. It's an event
when he completes a pair of shoes.

07:11.868 --> 07:15.705
They ring the cathedral bell
and the town celebrates.

07:16.873 --> 07:20.252
There's a town
that needs a bowling alley.

07:22.128 --> 07:24.506
- Evening, all.
- Hey, Frasier.

07:24.673 --> 07:28.218
Roz, did you hear the show?
I was in top form.

07:28.385 --> 07:31.846
I brilliantly cut a narcissist
down to size.

07:33.515 --> 07:36.184
Thank you, Niles.

07:36.351 --> 07:40.021
Oh, Dad, new shoes?
Do I hear cathedral bells?

07:43.066 --> 07:45.610
Ring-a-ding-ding.

07:46.653 --> 07:49.989
Roz, I apologise
for leaving you last night.

07:50.156 --> 07:52.992
I hope you didn't
have to fend off Bulldog.

07:53.159 --> 07:56.788
He's not so bad.
Actually, we had a good time.

07:56.955 --> 08:01.960
- Oh?
- What, "oh"?

08:02.126 --> 08:04.963
I noticed he came into work

08:05.129 --> 08:08.716
wearing the same clothes
he had on yesterday.

08:08.883 --> 08:11.177
Oh?

08:11.344 --> 08:15.264
- What's going on?
- Roz slept with Bulldog last night.

08:17.058 --> 08:20.144
I did not! How could you think that?

08:20.311 --> 08:25.024
Dropping by, bringing you gifts -
he was after something.

08:25.191 --> 08:31.030
That's not fair. Dr Crane brings me gifts
and he's not after anything.

08:33.000 --> 08:39.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:42.332 --> 08:45.836
I did not sleep with Bulldog.
He didn't even hit on me.

08:46.003 --> 08:50.758
But he wanted something. He wanted
me to leave you and be his producer.

08:50.925 --> 08:53.636
I wonder why he said that.

08:58.015 --> 09:02.311
- Because he really wants me.
- Yes, that goes without saying.

09:03.145 --> 09:08.275
- For his show.
- Bulldog knows he has to be subtle.

09:08.442 --> 09:11.320
But his ultimate goal remains to...

09:11.487 --> 09:14.823
- To what?
- To play Aeneas to your Dido.

09:20.788 --> 09:23.916
I'm sorry you had to hear that,
Daphne.

09:24.083 --> 09:29.546
As usual, I haven't the foggiest
idea what you're talking about.

09:30.839 --> 09:32.883
This is so insulting.

09:33.050 --> 09:37.096
You think he wants me to work for him
just to get me into his bed.

09:37.262 --> 09:39.973
It doesn't occur to you
he thinks I'm a good producer.

09:40.140 --> 09:44.019
- Aren't you being naive?
- I'll tell you what naive is.

09:44.186 --> 09:46.480
It's someone who thinks
he can talk to me like that

09:46.647 --> 09:48.690
without getting a crutch up his butt!

09:49.942 --> 09:53.612
- I'm an expert in human behaviour!
- Oh, really?

09:53.779 --> 09:57.032
Excuse me.
I've heard your expert advice!

09:57.199 --> 10:01.912
The only mental disorder
you've ever cured is insomnia!

10:03.872 --> 10:05.916
So you had time to listen,

10:06.083 --> 10:11.296
what with your demanding tasks:
answering phones and pushing buttons.

10:11.463 --> 10:15.592
A cockatoo with a strong beak
could do what you do!

10:17.010 --> 10:20.138
Then hire one.
I'm taking the job with Bulldog.

10:21.056 --> 10:23.225
That's it. I am out of here.

10:31.274 --> 10:34.569
Take a picture,
because I'm out of your life!

10:35.570 --> 10:37.989
You have seen the last of me!

10:39.616 --> 10:41.868
Sayonara!

10:43.328 --> 10:45.830
Oh, damn! My purse.

10:50.210 --> 10:54.881
Bruce, I see we are loaded
with callers. What line is next?

10:55.048 --> 10:59.594
- What's your favourite number?
- Three.

11:01.095 --> 11:03.473
(Dialling tone)

11:03.640 --> 11:05.516
Damn.

11:06.476 --> 11:09.020
What's your other favourite number?

11:09.187 --> 11:11.439
Just let me handle this.

11:12.315 --> 11:15.943
Hello. You're on the line
with Frasier Crane. I'm listening.

11:16.110 --> 11:18.905
'Hi, Dr Crane.
My name is Francesca.

11:19.072 --> 11:23.451
'I'm calling about my boyfriend.
He says he loves me,

11:23.618 --> 11:27.663
'but I'm afraid I'll get home one day
and he won't be there.

11:27.830 --> 11:31.709
'It probably stems from my childhood
when my father left us.'

11:31.876 --> 11:36.130
Francesca, you are suffering
from a fear of abandonment,

11:36.297 --> 11:38.341
but I'm here for you.

11:38.508 --> 11:40.927
(Francesca)
'Thank you. I'm always so afraid

11:41.093 --> 11:45.348
'the people I count on
will' just disappear and I'll...'

11:45.514 --> 11:48.434
(Phone line goes dead)

11:50.311 --> 11:52.146
Sorry.

11:55.316 --> 11:59.028
Francesca,
we had a little technical glitch.

11:59.195 --> 12:01.238
We're almost out of time.

12:01.405 --> 12:05.117
Call in tomorrow
and I'll make sure you're first.

12:05.284 --> 12:10.915
We're just about wrapped up here.
I'll see you tomorrow, Seattle.

12:18.797 --> 12:20.883
Good show, Dr Crane.

12:22.760 --> 12:25.638
- You think so, Bruce?
- Yeah.

12:25.804 --> 12:29.933
When my show starts with a screech
that could shatter crystal,

12:30.100 --> 12:32.144
then plays me eating chips,

12:32.311 --> 12:36.190
then disconnects a woman
who fears abandonment,

12:36.357 --> 12:39.443
it's not a show
to mail to the Smithsonian.

12:40.778 --> 12:44.490
Don't worry, man.
You'll do better tomorrow.

12:47.868 --> 12:52.831
- It's going to be a great show, Roz.
- You've got a minute to show time.

12:52.998 --> 12:55.292
- Hello, Roz.
- Hello, Frasier.

12:55.459 --> 13:00.339
Hope you haven't been avoiding me
because I stole your chick.

13:00.505 --> 13:03.800
- We're getting along great.
- I heard Bruce.

13:03.967 --> 13:06.845
Did the cockatoo
want too much money?

13:09.348 --> 13:12.434
- Bye, Roz.
- So long, Frasier.

13:12.601 --> 13:17.147
A moment, Frasier, please.
I'm sure word has reached your ear

13:17.314 --> 13:19.441
about my <i>frutti di mare</i> party

13:19.608 --> 13:22.903
to celebrate our city's bounty
from the sea.

13:23.069 --> 13:27.240
- Yes. I'd love to come.
- There's the rub. I've invited Roz.

13:27.407 --> 13:32.746
With the rift between you, the tension
will be thicker than my cioppino.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.707
That rift will soon be over.

13:35.874 --> 13:40.170
Bulldog will prove
he just wants to get his hands on Roz.

13:40.337 --> 13:43.715
That moment may have arrived.
She's bending over.

13:43.882 --> 13:45.967
Turn around, Bulldog!

13:46.134 --> 13:49.429
Isn't that what golfers refer to as
"teeing it up"?

13:50.638 --> 13:53.600
All right. He moves in.
And he...

13:53.767 --> 13:55.977
...helps pick up the papers!

13:56.144 --> 14:00.482
I'm so sorry, Frasier. l, too,
entertained hopes for low comedy.

14:02.192 --> 14:07.071
Attention, sports fans! You're back
in the doghouse with Bulldog Briscoe!

14:07.238 --> 14:09.449
- Woof woof!
- Meow!

14:09.616 --> 14:13.620
Football: Broncos over the Raiders!
Easy money, eh, Roz?

14:13.786 --> 14:18.875
Yeah, right, and men just want
to cuddle. LA humiliated Denver!

14:19.042 --> 14:22.920
Do I tell you how to clean?
Denver's due. It's a no-brainer.

14:23.087 --> 14:25.590
Then it's right up your alley.

14:29.886 --> 14:34.223
I'm no sports fan, but they really
are quite delicious together.

14:34.390 --> 14:37.769
Enjoy it now.
Bulldog can't control his libido forever.

14:37.935 --> 14:41.439
- Then Roz will crawl back to you.
- Yes.

14:41.606 --> 14:46.402
Meanwhile, I need a half-competent
producer. How hard is that?

14:46.569 --> 14:49.155
# They call me Mr Pitiful

14:49.322 --> 14:52.116
# Baby, that's my name

14:52.283 --> 14:55.077
# They call me Mr Pitiful

14:55.244 --> 14:58.122
# That's how I got my fame

14:58.289 --> 15:01.125
# But nobody seems to understand now

15:01.292 --> 15:04.086
# What makes a man feel so blue

15:04.253 --> 15:07.006
# They call me Mr Pitiful

15:07.173 --> 15:10.092
# Cause I lost someone just like you

15:10.259 --> 15:12.970
# They call me Mr Pitiful

15:13.137 --> 15:15.890
# This everybody knows now

15:16.056 --> 15:18.642
# They call me Mr Pitiful

15:18.809 --> 15:21.896
# Most everyplace I go now

15:22.062 --> 15:24.106
# But nobody seems
to understand now... #

15:27.902 --> 15:32.364
This morning, Maris and l
woke to the sound of our gardener

15:32.531 --> 15:34.992
hacking through our topiary.

15:35.159 --> 15:37.911
Why do you want hedges
shaped like animals?

15:38.078 --> 15:43.292
We're both animal lovers,
but Maris is unable to have pets. She...

15:46.170 --> 15:50.382
She distrusts anything
that loves her unconditionally.

15:53.760 --> 15:59.558
There was Yoshi, drunk as a lord,
recklessly swinging his hedge trimmer.

15:59.725 --> 16:01.852
Before we could calm him,
he had transformed

16:02.019 --> 16:07.357
Maris' prized stallion
into an obscene goatboy.

16:12.321 --> 16:16.116
- The poor woman is inconsolable.
- Thank you, Niles.

16:16.283 --> 16:18.410
You've been a great help.

16:18.577 --> 16:21.997
There are worse things
than a ruined career.

16:22.164 --> 16:26.001
I could have my hedges
cut into unattractive shapes.

16:27.544 --> 16:30.046
It's always about you, isn't it?

16:30.213 --> 16:34.551
I'm just the slightest bit panicky
I'll never get Roz back.

16:34.718 --> 16:38.263
I've been waiting for weeks
for Bulldog to make his move

16:38.430 --> 16:40.640
and he hasn't.

16:40.807 --> 16:45.604
- I thought we might run into you two.
- We've been buying shoes.

16:45.770 --> 16:49.816
Not that I don't appreciate
the ones you bought me,

16:49.983 --> 16:55.030
but I'll save those for special
occasions when only tassels will do.

16:55.196 --> 16:59.826
Hey, get a load of these.
They light up when I walk away.

17:01.786 --> 17:04.164
Doesn't everyone?

17:06.124 --> 17:09.794
I see Mr Congeniality
is still spreading sunshine.

17:09.961 --> 17:15.884
- Things didn't go well in his show.
- Really? These things go in cycles.

17:16.050 --> 17:21.556
Take Bulldog's show. He's just had
one great show after another lately.

17:22.640 --> 17:26.102
What could be your point?
I can't read between the lines.

17:26.269 --> 17:31.858
lf you weren't so stubborn,
you'd apologise to Roz and get her back.

17:32.025 --> 17:34.736
You're ignoring
a key psychological component.

17:34.902 --> 17:38.114
- You'd have to admit you were wrong.
- Exactly!

17:40.241 --> 17:43.286
I don't see what's so hard
about that.

17:43.453 --> 17:48.583
It's not the same as Dad or you being
wrong. I have a degree from Harvard.

17:48.749 --> 17:52.336
Whenever I'm wrong,
the world makes less sense.

17:58.467 --> 18:02.346
Why do you want her back?
She's pushy and opinionated.

18:02.513 --> 18:08.060
Aren't you being sexist? That would
be labelled "assertiveness" in a man.

18:08.227 --> 18:12.565
Gone are the days when women
were shunted aside to say nothing.

18:12.732 --> 18:16.235
- I quite agree.
- Daphne, please, I can handle this.

18:16.444 --> 18:19.071
You've handled it well so far.

18:19.238 --> 18:24.410
It's time you got off your high horse
and begged her forgiveness.

18:24.577 --> 18:26.745
And get your knees dusty.

18:26.912 --> 18:30.749
I'm sorry, I'm not quite ready
to swallow my pride.

18:32.293 --> 18:35.671
Next time,
wake me when the show's over.

18:43.262 --> 18:47.850
End of Wednesday's show
we do the "Boner of the Week".

18:48.017 --> 18:50.436
- No.
- This is why I hate you.

18:50.602 --> 18:54.314
You want to change
my tried and true format! Why not?

18:54.481 --> 18:57.401
I got you an interview
with Wayne Gretzky.

18:57.568 --> 18:59.820
See... Wayne Gretzky?

19:00.946 --> 19:04.366
This is awesome! This is total brilliance!

19:04.533 --> 19:07.035
This is...a pinched nerve.

19:09.079 --> 19:14.251
Football injury. I got my head rammed
into a locker during an interview.

19:14.418 --> 19:19.715
- Let me help you with that.
- This is great. I can't believe it.

19:19.881 --> 19:22.551
Wayne Gretzky! The great one!

19:23.885 --> 19:28.890
Roz, you are the great one.
You are some kind of producer.

19:29.057 --> 19:32.394
Thanks. I'm having a great time.

19:32.561 --> 19:35.730
I owe you, Bulldog. I owe you big.

19:43.697 --> 19:48.034
It's amazing, but you and l
have great chemistry together.

19:48.201 --> 19:52.497
Uh-huh. I like chemistry.
I flunked it, but I like it.

19:53.581 --> 19:57.168
You got any of that Wild Turkey left?

19:57.335 --> 19:59.379
Yeah. Sure.

20:00.672 --> 20:03.383
When we started working together,

20:03.550 --> 20:07.470
I never thought it would turn out
like this. Did you?

20:07.637 --> 20:09.681
All along!

20:14.727 --> 20:16.771
Hey, Roz!

20:18.147 --> 20:21.401
You'd better make mine a double!

20:21.568 --> 20:23.945
I'm a double kind of guy!

20:24.112 --> 20:28.491
No, there's a lot I want to do tonight
and I want you to keep up.

20:29.534 --> 20:31.786
Yeah, well, uh...

20:31.953 --> 20:36.082
All I ask is you give me
a couple of 20-minute breaks.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.003
What's that?

20:41.170 --> 20:44.507
I thought a little music might be nice.

20:45.258 --> 20:48.928
- Can you concentrate with that on?
- Oh, yeah.

20:49.095 --> 20:53.683
Actually,
I find the distraction helps me.

20:57.395 --> 20:59.564
Nah. Second date. Don't be pushy.

21:01.190 --> 21:04.610
This is great, Roz! Us working like this!

21:06.237 --> 21:09.031
Did you and the doc
ever end up working...

21:10.741 --> 21:13.995
- What?
- You and the doc ever work like this?

21:14.161 --> 21:17.331
We tried, but he complained
I talked too much.

21:17.498 --> 21:21.752
Oh, yeah? I would have figured you
for a screamer.

21:24.713 --> 21:28.217
What the hell are you doing in my bed?
Get out!

21:28.384 --> 21:32.805
I asked you over here to work,
you disgusting pervert!

21:32.972 --> 21:36.892
Slow down!
I'm getting some mixed signals here.

21:40.854 --> 21:43.983
- What are you doing?
- Is this clear enough?

21:44.149 --> 21:48.487
- Are you crazy? My wallet's in there!
- Get out, now!

21:48.654 --> 21:50.698
Get out of my way, Doc!

21:51.782 --> 21:53.701
Oh.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.163
I'm listening.

22:04.586 --> 22:09.842
# Baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:10.008 --> 22:11.885
# Quite stylish!

22:12.052 --> 22:18.767
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Yeah, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:18.934 --> 22:25.691
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:25.857 --> 22:28.360
# They're calling again

22:28.527 --> 22:31.321
# Scrambled egg's all over my face!

22:31.488 --> 22:35.450
# What is a boy to do? #

22:35.617 --> 22:38.912
Thank you!
