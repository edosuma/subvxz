<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.879 --> 00:06.090
I am Zach and Gail's daughter,
Sarah Salvatore.

00:06.257 --> 00:07.550
Why don't you believe me?

00:07.717 --> 00:11.762
Because Sarah Salvatore is at Duke University
where she studies as an Art Major.

00:11.929 --> 00:14.098
- Now who the hell are you?
- My name is Monique.

00:14.265 --> 00:16.100
- I want the whole story.
- Don't do this.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.185
- No!
- Find out sooner or later.

00:18.352 --> 00:21.939
So when my mom has a brain tumor,
then we'll just give her vampire blood.

00:22.106 --> 00:25.943
If our blood cured cancer,
we would've heard about that by now.

JO: In our coven's tradition,
the twins merge their strength...

00:28.946 --> 00:31.240
-...the stronger one wins...
- The weaker one dies.

00:31.407 --> 00:35.119
Why should we die because our sister's
too weak to defeat our psychopath brother?

00:35.286 --> 00:37.747
Merging is our duty to the coven.
It's why we were born.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.206
This is the anti-magic border.

00:39.373 --> 00:42.293
You sucked up all that magic
from the Traveler spell.

00:42.460 --> 00:44.879
- U n h!
- A lot of magic.

00:45.046 --> 00:49.508
I don't know what we were, or are or what
we're supposed to be, but I wanna see you.

Come over.

00:53.804 --> 00:55.639

KAI: See, we never went out to eat
when I was a kid.

01:03.856 --> 01:07.026
I always had this fascination
with chefs and fine dining.

01:07.193 --> 01:09.862
My dad actually loves to cook.
He's old-school, of course.

01:10.029 --> 01:13.449
He taught me to measure by eye,
season by taste, all that stuff.

01:13.616 --> 01:18.454
But it's different now in the restaurant
world. I mean, everything's on timers.

01:18.621 --> 01:23.375
It's, like, fries go in, you push a button,
ding, you take them out.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.127
Literally no guess work.

01:27.671 --> 01:28.964
Why am I here?

01:29.131 --> 01:31.092
I spent 18 years
in abandoned restaurants...

01:31.258 --> 01:33.427

the fruits of my labor.

I don't mean the Mystic Grill.

01:36.847 --> 01:40.184
Oh, you mean like...
Like "here" here, in Mystic Falls?

01:41.018 --> 01:42.520
Sorry, I'm nervous. I'm...

01:42.686 --> 01:43.771
You're really pretty.

01:44.230 --> 01:46.190
Why am I here, Kai?

01:46.357 --> 01:51.028
Well, I took the spell that was keeping
supernaturals out of Mystic Falls, and I...

01:51.195 --> 01:55.324
I, like, absorbed it.
Like, ate it, I guess.

01:56.075 --> 02:00.663
It's cool, huh? First I eat magic,
and then eventually I lose it, but...

02:00.830 --> 02:03.582
I mean, a huge spell like that?
I mean, come on.

02:03.749 --> 02:06.293
Magic's oozing out of me.
It's all over the place.

02:06.460 --> 02:10.172
I didn't realize I was out of control
until I met the manager a few hours ago.

02:10.339 --> 02:13.509
And he was all like,
"You can't come in here. We're closed.

02:13.676 --> 02:16.095
And you have an unconscious girl
over your shoulder."

02:16.262 --> 02:20.182
I was like, "Don't judge me." So then I
gave him a heart attack, or tried to.

02:20.349 --> 02:24.478
All I did was make him vomit uncontrollably,
which was like, ugh. All right, let's stop that.

02:24.645 --> 02:28.983
So I tried again. And I think I broke
his spine. I'm not really sure.

02:29.150 --> 02:32.444
Because the third time I tried the spell,
he kind of exploded in blood.

02:34.780 --> 02:38.325
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- I just told you, I have too much magic.

02:38.492 --> 02:42.830
It wasn't until my test run with
the manager that I realized...

02:42.997 --> 02:47.543
...if I start to merge with Jo, and my gushing
fountains of magic turn her into that guy...

02:47.710 --> 02:49.920
...then I'm not gonna have a twin
for the merge.

02:50.087 --> 02:53.924
So, Elena, that is why you're here.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.385
Because...

02:57.303 --> 03:00.890
...I need to get my magic under control
by practicing with you.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.851
Or rather by practicing on you.

03:04.018 --> 03:08.898
Oh, hey, P.S., silver lining. After the
manager finally stopped thrashing around...

03:09.064 --> 03:12.610
...I finally managed a cloaking spell.

So go. Walk right into your own grave
if that's what you want. I won't stop you.

following your destiny.

It's always easy, Stefan.
It is literally magic.

31:41.984 --> 31:44.945
Then why have I never heard
of our blood curing cancer before?

31:45.112 --> 31:48.282
Because vampires don't pull charity shifts
at the sick ward.

Perhaps it is a little dark.
There's a morbid undertone.
