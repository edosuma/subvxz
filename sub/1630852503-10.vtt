00:08.173 --> 00:09.442
The accident affected
all of you.

00:09.509 --> 00:10.443
I was drunk.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.379
I intercepted the paramedic's

00:12.445 --> 00:14.280
<i>field report that said</i>
<i>he was impaired.</i>

00:14.347 --> 00:16.549
{\an5}How can I make this right?

00:14.347 --> 00:16.549
I'm not sure you can, Mom.

00:16.616 --> 00:19.452

Governor just declared
a state of emergency.

We have a bus crash
in the middle of a shift change.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.793

00:25.125 --> 00:26.793
GRIFF: <i> I may not have</i>

Okay, well,
Pyne says that she checked in

touched down in Detroit,

00:52.685 --> 00:54.587

00:52.685 --> 00:54.587
Where are we on the plate?

{\an1}Debris is making the site

Lung cancer. On chemo.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.177
This may be a little cold.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.144
Should we intubate?

01:18.211 --> 01:19.512
Not unless we have to.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.147
Get RT down here,
start a breathing treatment,

01:21.214 --> 01:22.215

01:23.683 --> 01:25.351
You're the first patient
we've had in a while who wasn't

01:25.418 --> 01:26.820
in a car wreck
because of the storm.

01:26.886 --> 01:29.622
(chuckles) Car wreck
sounds better than this.

01:29.689 --> 01:32.125
{\an5}Well, we're gonna take

Farm truck turned over

01:39.199 --> 01:40.467

getting this crate off?

01:42.168 --> 01:44.404
{\an5}(grunts)

01:42.168 --> 01:44.404
Wait, wait. No, no.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.406
You pull this crate off
without pre-treating him,

01:46.473 --> 01:48.441
toxins from the damaged cells
will flood his bloodstream

01:48.508 --> 01:49.676
{\an5}and kill him.

01:48.508 --> 01:49.676
It's crush syndrome.

01:49.742 --> 01:51.244
I'll start aggressive
fluid resuscitation

01:51.311 --> 01:52.512
with sodium bicarbonate.

01:52.579 --> 01:54.547
{\an1}Check vitals and get him
to imaging. If a piece

01:54.614 --> 01:56.516
{\an1}of this crate broke off
inside of him, we need to know.

01:56.583 --> 01:58.184
Do you know my son?

01:58.251 --> 01:59.886
{\an1}Kevin Dunn.
He's 12.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.155
He had surgery here.

02:02.222 --> 02:04.624
Yeah, I know your son.
Look, he did great.

02:04.691 --> 02:07.160
Really? He's okay?
Yup.

02:07.227 --> 02:08.661
Your wife just went upstairs
to see him.

02:08.728 --> 02:10.497
(sighs)
I want to see him.

02:10.562 --> 02:13.900
We need to get you out from
under this crate first, okay?

02:13.967 --> 02:14.801
Dr. Griffith.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.603
{\an1}That was the state trooper.
They confirmed

02:16.669 --> 02:18.171
{\an1}the plate of the car
in the wreck.

02:18.238 --> 02:20.540
It is your mother's,
but she's not in it.

02:20.607 --> 02:22.509
{\an3}What?

02:20.607 --> 02:22.509
She's not in it?

02:22.575 --> 02:23.710
Apparently, she's nowhere
in the vicinity.

02:23.776 --> 02:26.679
{\an3}Well, where the
hell is she?

02:26.746 --> 02:28.548
Hey, are you going back to
the crash site right now?

02:28.615 --> 02:30.483
{\an3}Do not leave without me.
I'm coming with you.

02:30.550 --> 02:32.151
Sam, Sam, Sam, let me go.

02:30.550 --> 02:32.151
{\an3}No.

02:32.218 --> 02:33.419
{\an5}Sam.

02:32.218 --> 02:33.419
Dad, the last thing

02:33.486 --> 02:35.889
I said to Mom was that things
between us could not be fixed.

02:35.955 --> 02:38.191
{\an5}You have to let me do this.

02:35.955 --> 02:38.191
Okay, hang on.

02:38.258 --> 02:39.626
Whoa, whoa,
it was your mom's car.

02:39.692 --> 02:42.161
{\an5}Yeah, I got to go.

02:39.692 --> 02:42.161
Well, l-let me drive.

02:42.228 --> 02:43.563
No.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.398
We're short-staffed as it is,
and I don't know when

02:45.465 --> 02:47.333

are gonna get here.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.202
Oh, they're here.

02:49.269 --> 02:50.436
Sorry I'm late.

02:50.503 --> 02:51.905
{\an3}(chuckles)
Plows took forever.

02:51.971 --> 02:52.872
I hear your mother's out there.

02:52.939 --> 02:55.708
{\an5}Do they know anything?

02:52.939 --> 02:55.708
GRIFF: Nothing useful.

02:55.775 --> 02:57.410
Here, take that.

02:57.477 --> 02:59.579
Thank you. I'm heading back
out there now.

02:59.646 --> 03:01.347
If the rescue crews
can't find her, I will.

03:01.414 --> 03:03.349
Good luck. Hey, and...

03:03.416 --> 03:05.485
she's gonna be okay.

03:07.253 --> 03:09.255

don't take I-75.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.293
{\an3}Okay.

03:13.359 --> 03:14.594

you get there.

03:14.661 --> 03:16.429

03:14.661 --> 03:16.429

You go find your mother.

so far?

{\an3}to check when her water broke.
I didn't want to risk infection,

04:52.058 --> 04:53.860

she's got to be close

{\an7}You.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.040
{\an9}(grunts)

06:50.510 --> 06:51.444
{\an7}Hey.

06:51.511 --> 06:52.879
{\an9}Oh, my God.

06:51.511 --> 06:52.879
{\an7}Sorry.

06:52.945 --> 06:54.180
{\an7}I didn't know
you were still here.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.848
{\an9}Yeah, I was just about
to head out.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.750
{\an7}I was thinking
about yesterday.

06:57.817 --> 06:59.118
{\an8}You know, how...

06:59.185 --> 07:01.654
{\an7}we were arguing about
wedding stuff before you left.

07:01.721 --> 07:03.122
{\an9}Mm-hmm.

07:01.721 --> 07:03.122
{\an8}Since the engagement,

07:03.189 --> 07:05.024
{\an8}it feels like all we do
is argue about the wedding.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.626
{\an9}Mm. Yeah,
you're right.

07:06.692 --> 07:08.694
{\an8}So, let's stop arguing.

07:06.692 --> 07:08.694
{\an9}Okay.

07:08.761 --> 07:09.896
{\an8}And just get married.

07:09.962 --> 07:11.631
{\an8}What? (chuckles)

07:11.697 --> 07:14.066
{\an8}You were stuck in a blizzard
for 14 hours.

07:14.133 --> 07:15.535
{\an8}What if you hadn't come back?

07:15.601 --> 07:18.070
{\an7}We don't know
how much time we have,

07:18.137 --> 07:21.808
{\an8}so let's stop wasting it
planning a party

07:21.874 --> 07:23.543
{\an8}and just get married now.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.711
{\an9}Right now?

07:23.609 --> 07:25.711
{\an8}Right now.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.648
{\an8}Well, I have rounds right now,
but today.

07:28.714 --> 07:29.515
{\an9}Okay.

07:29.582 --> 07:31.617
{\an7}Okay. Yes.

07:29.582 --> 07:31.617
{\an8}(laughs) Yeah, let's do it.

07:35.988 --> 07:37.790
{\an8}I'll handle everything.

07:35.988 --> 07:37.790
{\an8}Okay. (laughs)

07:43.062 --> 07:44.664
{\an8}Hey, sorry I'm late.

07:43.062 --> 07:44.664
{\an8}(phone buzzes, chimes)

07:44.730 --> 07:46.799
{\an8}Why am I apologizing
to you guys?

07:46.866 --> 07:48.000
{\an8}"Hi, Isan. Good to see you.

07:48.067 --> 07:49.735
{\an9}So glad you didn't die
in the storm."

07:49.802 --> 07:51.137
{\an8}Where's Sam?

07:49.802 --> 07:51.137
{\an8}Oh, she just texted.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.805
{\an7}She's at the crash site,
but her mom's okay.

07:52.872 --> 07:54.540
{\an8}Oh. What does that mean for us?

07:52.872 --> 07:54.540
{\an9}(exhales)

07:54.607 --> 07:56.709
{\an8}That's your question?

07:54.607 --> 07:56.709
{\an8}Yes. How do we do rounds?

07:56.776 --> 07:58.511
{\an8}Who's in charge?

07:56.776 --> 07:58.511
{\an9}Uh...

08:00.580 --> 08:02.181
{\an8}(phone buzzes)

08:02.248 --> 08:04.016
{\an7}DONNA:
Any word on Dr. Katz?

08:07.253 --> 08:08.754
{\an8}She's okay.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.823
Oh, thank God.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.125
Yeah.

08:13.192 --> 08:15.661
So, we have a post-op checkup

08:15.728 --> 08:17.230
{\an3}on our pediatric
patient.

08:17.296 --> 08:19.565
Aortic valve replacement,
triple CABG,

08:19.632 --> 08:21.734
and a possible bronch
for persistent hemoptysis.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.002
{\an3}Shall we?

08:23.936 --> 08:25.972
Guess we know who's in charge.

08:27.907 --> 08:29.909
{\an5}(sighs)

08:27.907 --> 08:29.909
(door opens)

08:31.577 --> 08:33.746
Well, if it isn't Clara Barton.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.780
Hey, Ma. (laughs)

08:35.847 --> 08:37.049
Look, what are you doing here?

08:37.116 --> 08:38.784
Board called
an emergency meeting

08:38.851 --> 08:40.019
{\an3}to deal with the impact
of the storm,

08:40.086 --> 08:42.020
including the blood shortage,

08:42.087 --> 08:44.757
which my son
successfully

08:44.824 --> 08:46.926
{\an3}mitigated with an
in-house blood drive.

08:46.993 --> 08:48.794
{\an1}I am just doing
what I can to help.

08:48.861 --> 08:49.862
You stepped up
in a big way,

08:49.929 --> 08:51.998
and the board's
very impressed.

08:52.064 --> 08:54.867
{\an3}And speaking of the board,
I understand your CMO

08:54.934 --> 08:56.802
{\an5}is out of commission.

08:54.934 --> 08:56.802
Temporarily.

08:56.869 --> 08:59.071
{\an5}So you're filling in?

08:56.869 --> 08:59.071
Where I can.

08:59.138 --> 09:01.173
Look, what do you need?

09:02.708 --> 09:05.778
Um... operative reports
for the last two weeks?

09:07.113 --> 09:09.715
{\an1}I can pull those up.
What doctor?

09:09.782 --> 09:11.984
Rob Griffith.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.120
{\an3}What? The vote for
Chief of Cardiothoracics

09:14.186 --> 09:15.922
{\an3}is in a couple of weeks.
I want to know

09:15.988 --> 09:17.957
{\an3}if the scalpel he dropped
was an isolated event.

09:18.024 --> 09:20.126
There aren't any reports.

09:20.192 --> 09:21.994
{\an3}What?

09:22.061 --> 09:23.996
That bypass surgery
was two weeks ago.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.565
{\an3}Surely, the man has been
primary in a surgery since?

09:26.632 --> 09:28.868
{\an1}Not according
to this.

09:28.935 --> 09:30.736
Then what has he been doing?

09:31.971 --> 09:33.973
(chuckles)

09:34.040 --> 09:35.975
Ah.

09:36.042 --> 09:37.143
{\an3}That was...

09:37.209 --> 09:38.978
incredible.

09:37.209 --> 09:38.978
{\an1}It is,

09:39.045 --> 09:40.613
every time.

09:40.680 --> 09:41.914
Bringing a life
into the world.

09:41.981 --> 09:45.017
No, I-I mean you.
You didn't skip a beat.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.019
{\an3}It was like you never
stopped practicing.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.955
{\an1}It was just
muscle memory.

09:49.021 --> 09:50.957
It was awesome, Mom.

09:51.991 --> 09:54.894
Sam, these last two weeks have
been the longest of my life.

09:54.961 --> 09:56.996
I'm sorry that I've been
dodging your calls.

09:57.063 --> 09:58.998
{\an6}I just...

09:57.063 --> 09:58.998
No, I'm sorry.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.033
{\an5}I should have...

09:59.065 --> 10:01.033
Mom, after everything
that's happened,

10:01.100 --> 10:02.969
honestly, all I care about
is that you're okay.

10:05.171 --> 10:06.038
{\an5}(grunts)

10:05.171 --> 10:06.038
Mom!

10:07.139 --> 10:09.008
Hey, I need some help over here!

10:09.075 --> 10:10.209
Mom?

10:17.984 --> 10:19.752
(flashlight clicks)

10:21.854 --> 10:23.823
Delayed pupillary
light reflex.

10:23.889 --> 10:25.057
{\an5}Hmm, but symmetrical.

10:23.889 --> 10:25.057
Hmm.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.692
What happened?

10:26.759 --> 10:29.028
{\an3}You fainted and hit your
head, that's what happened.

10:29.095 --> 10:30.930
Your brain CT
was normal...

10:30.997 --> 10:31.931
But you have a concussion.

10:31.998 --> 10:33.733
I was about to say that.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.634
{\an3}Let's keep her in overnight
for observation.

10:35.701 --> 10:37.937
{\an3}IV maintenance fluids
for hydration.

10:38.004 --> 10:38.938
Treat the headache.

10:38.004 --> 10:38.938
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

10:39.005 --> 10:40.840
{\an3}I was about
to say that, too.

10:40.906 --> 10:42.975
How's Sadie and the baby?
I should go and check on them.

10:43.042 --> 10:45.011
{\an5}No, no, Mom, Mom.

10:43.042 --> 10:45.011
Hey, hey, hey.

10:45.077 --> 10:46.412
{\an5}(exhales)

10:45.077 --> 10:46.412
SAM: Take it easy.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.781
You're lucky that a mild TBI
is all we have to treat.

10:48.848 --> 10:51.150
I'll follow up with you
in a few hours.

10:51.217 --> 10:52.918
{\an5}Thanks, Steph.

10:51.217 --> 10:52.918
Thank you.

10:51.217 --> 10:52.918
{\an3}Thanks.

10:52.985 --> 10:55.054
Oh, Asher must be worried sick.

10:55.121 --> 10:57.790
Can one of you call him?
Tell him I lost my phone.

10:57.857 --> 10:58.958
{\an3}SAM:
I spoke to him this morning.

10:59.025 --> 11:01.961
He's in Denver. He's waiting
for the next flight back.

11:02.028 --> 11:03.662
I'll check in with him
while you rest.

11:03.729 --> 11:04.930
{\an1}VIVIAN:
Thank you, Sam.

11:08.034 --> 11:10.036
You've put up with a lot
from me over the years,

11:10.102 --> 11:12.438
but this is a hell
of a revenge scheme.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.941
Our daughter
is speaking to me again.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.943
It's worth the concussion.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.812
That is a crazy thing to say.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.013
You should have
your head examined.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.949
(chuckles weakly)

11:24.016 --> 11:26.085
<i>(elevator bell dings)</i>

11:28.054 --> 11:29.188
{\an1}Oh.

11:29.255 --> 11:31.824
{\an1}Hi.

11:29.255 --> 11:31.824
{\an3}Hey.

11:31.891 --> 11:32.958
How's your mom?

11:33.025 --> 11:35.428
{\an1}Uh, she's all right.
Thanks.

11:35.494 --> 11:37.997
Um, mild concussion,

11:38.064 --> 11:40.900
{\an4}not that a head injury
ever stopped her.

11:38.064 --> 11:40.900
{\an3}Hmm.

11:40.966 --> 11:42.968
Yeah, I should probably
go by and check on her.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.004
{\an1}She'd probably
like that.

11:45.071 --> 11:46.939
{\an3}I actually have some
work questions for her.

11:47.006 --> 11:48.474
{\an1}(chuckles)
She would love that.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.142
{\an6}(chuckles)

11:48.541 --> 11:50.142
(elevator bell dings)

11:55.948 --> 11:57.450
{\an3}My, uh, mom's
looking for

11:57.516 --> 11:59.018
your dad's latest
surgical reports.

11:59.085 --> 12:00.986
Now, I couldn't find them,

12:01.053 --> 12:02.188
so I thought I'd ask
to see if you

12:02.254 --> 12:04.156
{\an3}knew where
they were, but

12:04.223 --> 12:06.158
you know what I realized?

12:06.225 --> 12:08.194
What?

12:08.260 --> 12:10.963
I am so tired of talking
about our parents.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.131
(both chuckle)

12:12.198 --> 12:13.933
{\an1}SAM:
Me, too.

12:13.999 --> 12:16.902
(sighs) It was better when
we just talked about our dads

12:16.969 --> 12:18.871
and not also our moms.

12:18.938 --> 12:20.840
Yeah, it was better when we
didn't talk about any of 'em.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.075
Yeah, it was.

12:26.946 --> 12:28.848
(elevator bell dings)

12:28.914 --> 12:30.783
Have a good day.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.783
{\an1}You, too.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.253
{\an1}(coughing)

12:35.888 --> 12:38.524
Patricia Clark? Hello.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.093
So, it says here you have

12:41.160 --> 12:43.195
{\an1}stage 4 non-small cell
lung cancer.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.196
Post-induction therapy.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.098
It says here that you
came in through the ER?

12:46.165 --> 12:48.334
I couldn't breathe. Still can't.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.969
{\an3}CALEB:
She's on 100% oxygen

12:50.035 --> 12:51.837
{\an3}with intermittent
hemoptysis.

12:51.904 --> 12:54.140
Okay. What are our options,
Dr. Shah?

12:54.206 --> 12:55.141
{\an3}Well, if she continues
to decompensate

12:55.207 --> 12:56.976
{\an3}with worsening hypoxia,
we should intubate.

12:57.042 --> 12:59.245
{\an5}Hmm. What else?

12:57.042 --> 12:59.245
CALEB: A bronchoscopy

12:59.311 --> 13:02.081
{\an6}might temporize
the bleeding.

12:59.311 --> 13:02.081
{\an1}True,

13:02.148 --> 13:03.949
but I'd like to also prepare
for the possibility

13:04.016 --> 13:05.184
of a pneumonectomy.

13:05.251 --> 13:08.154
Patricia, the lung
that is failing you

13:08.220 --> 13:10.055
is so diseased

13:10.122 --> 13:12.158
that it may actually
be simpler to remove it.

13:12.224 --> 13:15.928
{\an1}You're gonna remove my lung?
Don't I need it?

13:15.995 --> 13:18.030
{\an3}Not if the diseased tissue
does you more harm than good.

13:18.097 --> 13:18.964
Exactly.

13:20.933 --> 13:23.135
Where is the doctor
that took care of me in the ER?

13:23.202 --> 13:25.337
Uh, Dr., uh, Trulie?

13:25.404 --> 13:26.872
Uh...

13:26.939 --> 13:28.974
She is not here

13:29.041 --> 13:31.944
right now, but we have
an excellent team of doctors

13:32.011 --> 13:32.811
who will take great care of you

13:32.878 --> 13:35.014
if we move forward
with this procedure.

13:37.349 --> 13:40.119
So, is Lex off the surgery?

13:40.186 --> 13:41.587
{\an3}I don't even know
where Lex is.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.989
Trauma. Crush syndrome. It was
a whole thing with a crate.

13:44.056 --> 13:46.025
{\an6}Oh.

13:44.056 --> 13:46.025
{\an1}Well, for the record, I would
love to be in the pneumonectomy.

13:46.091 --> 13:47.259
So would I.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.128
Okay. I haven't decided.

13:49.195 --> 13:52.164
A full lung removal
is a rare procedure.

13:52.231 --> 13:54.600
It's very technically difficult,
so you should be studying.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.101
All of you.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.204
I've never been
in a pneumonectomy.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.839
{\an5}None of us have.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.839
Well, I spoke up first.

14:00.906 --> 14:02.841
I offered an actual treatment.

14:02.908 --> 14:04.877
{\an4}(yawns)

14:02.908 --> 14:04.877
{\an1}Really?

14:04.944 --> 14:07.112
{\an3}You lost first assist
on our last two surgeries.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.280
Why aren't you
all over this?

14:08.347 --> 14:10.282
I'm prioritizing
my relationship.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.952
Plus, I don't need
brownie points in CT.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.154
{\an5}I excel where it matters.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.154
Are you talking
about plastics?

14:15.221 --> 14:17.356
{\an3}Doesn't Dr. Glass
still call you Jerry?

14:17.423 --> 14:20.025
{\an1}(chuckles)

14:26.198 --> 14:27.166
{\an1}Mom.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.302
{\an4}What are you
doing in here?

14:28.667 --> 14:30.302
{\an3}I, um...

14:30.369 --> 14:33.973
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure
her heart rate was coming down.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.275
{\an1}Okay. I can take care
of her heart.

14:36.342 --> 14:38.177
{\an5}You need to rest.

14:36.342 --> 14:38.177
Yeah. Okay.

14:38.244 --> 14:39.311
Okay.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.883
{\an1}Seeing one patient
isn't gonna kill me.

14:44.950 --> 14:46.919
You are concussed.

14:46.986 --> 14:49.221
I can't have you putting
yourself at any more risk.

14:49.288 --> 14:52.992
{\an3}I already thought
I lost you once today.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.293
You didn't lose me,

14:54.360 --> 14:58.197
{\an3}but I was afraid
I lost you

14:58.264 --> 15:01.133
when you wouldn't take my calls.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.968
Now I...

15:03.035 --> 15:04.970
I need you to understand this.

15:05.037 --> 15:06.672
I know it seems like I put

15:06.739 --> 15:09.008
{\an5}the hospital first...

15:06.739 --> 15:09.008
Let's not do this now.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.109
Your father and I...

15:10.175 --> 15:13.245
We had a plan

15:13.312 --> 15:15.114
back then.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.316
This dream.

15:17.383 --> 15:19.084
I mean,

15:19.151 --> 15:21.086
we were building
something big together.

15:21.153 --> 15:24.156
And when the accident happened,
I was just terrified.

15:24.223 --> 15:27.059
I... Scandals like that
sink hospitals.

15:27.126 --> 15:29.662
{\an3}They cost in money and donations
and endowments and...

15:29.728 --> 15:31.363
Mom, it's not what you did.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.167
{\an1}It's what
you didn't do.

15:35.234 --> 15:37.636
For years, I have wondered

15:37.703 --> 15:40.072
what was wrong with
my relationship with Dad.

15:40.139 --> 15:42.041
I have tried so hard
to understand

15:42.107 --> 15:44.009
the wall that he
put up between us.

15:44.076 --> 15:47.079
And all this time,
you have had the answer,

15:47.146 --> 15:48.180
and you didn't tell me.

15:48.247 --> 15:50.149
Sam...

15:50.215 --> 15:51.650
I don't want to talk
about this right now,

15:51.717 --> 15:53.352
{\an1}and you need
to rest.

15:53.419 --> 15:55.087
Please.

15:55.154 --> 15:56.322
(sighs)

16:03.395 --> 16:06.031
{\an1}Why are you guys studying
for a pneumonectomy?

16:06.098 --> 16:08.667
Because Sam hasn't assigned
first assist yet.

16:08.734 --> 16:10.002
{\an1}On who,
Patricia Clark?

16:10.069 --> 16:12.104
{\an1}Wait, that's my patient.
I did her intake.

16:12.171 --> 16:15.074
{\an3}Missing rounds reflects
a lack of commitment.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.976
{\an1}Really? Did you sleep great
in your bed last night?

16:18.043 --> 16:19.678
{\an1}Because I am committed
to my third

16:19.745 --> 16:21.080
consecutive shift.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.281
{\an1}Dr. Shah
is very rested.

16:22.348 --> 16:24.183
Which is why

16:24.249 --> 16:26.218
he will be first assist
on the pneumonectomy.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.087
{\an3}Thank you.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.122
I won't let you down.

16:31.256 --> 16:33.058
Whatever.

16:37.363 --> 16:40.399
{\an3}Lex, you know I can't
assign you to a surgery

16:40.466 --> 16:42.134
{\an3}if you weren't there
to round on a patient.

16:42.201 --> 16:44.737
I know. I was treating patients
in the ER.

16:44.803 --> 16:48.006
You've already fulfilled all of
your elective hours down there.

16:48.073 --> 16:51.043
{\an3}We need you
up here.

16:51.110 --> 16:55.147
{\an3}Maybe I haven't told you lately
how much I depend on you.

16:55.214 --> 16:57.116
I want you in that surgery.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.318
(pager beeping)

16:59.385 --> 17:01.286
It's the ER.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.322
(sighs)

17:03.389 --> 17:06.224
But that means
you have to be here.

17:06.290 --> 17:08.060
Okay.

17:13.098 --> 17:15.666
Hi.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.636
(sighs)

17:17.703 --> 17:19.238
That was quite
the decision.

17:20.839 --> 17:23.142
{\an3}Felt pretty
straightforward to me.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.175
{\an3}I mean,

17:24.242 --> 17:26.044
{\an1}Lex was missing,
and Joey was late...

17:26.111 --> 17:28.113
I was on time.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.215
{\an3}Caleb, you haven't had more
than two consecutive

17:30.282 --> 17:32.751
{\an5}hours of sleep.

17:30.282 --> 17:32.751
You didn't even consider me.

17:32.818 --> 17:36.188
Where is this
coming from?

17:36.255 --> 17:38.257
Here, actually.

17:38.323 --> 17:41.427
{\an3}Oh. These bunks are
the only place we go.

17:41.493 --> 17:44.096
{\an1}You signed up
for casual.

17:44.163 --> 17:45.831
{\an1}We were really clear
about this.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.833
{\an1}I said I can't get serious
right now...

17:47.900 --> 17:48.901
I know, I, I know.

17:48.967 --> 17:53.806
{\an3}It would... still be nice
to be taken seriously.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.545
And a few more steps.

17:59.611 --> 18:02.548
{\an5}Is this a trust exercise?

17:59.611 --> 18:02.548
Make a left.

18:02.614 --> 18:03.649
{\an1}Ready?

18:02.614 --> 18:03.649
Yeah.

18:03.715 --> 18:04.817
{\an1}Behold.

18:04.883 --> 18:06.819
Our wedding chapel.

18:06.885 --> 18:08.554
{\an1}(gasps)

18:08.620 --> 18:09.755
{\an3}JOEY:
You hate it.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.591
{\an4}No, no...

18:09.822 --> 18:12.591
I'm not done decorating.

18:12.658 --> 18:14.693
It'll be more festive
when the cake arrives.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.095
Chocolate and lemon... (sniffs)

18:17.162 --> 18:18.797
which I hate,

18:18.864 --> 18:21.099
{\an6}a lot.

18:18.864 --> 18:21.099
So you've said. (chuckles)

18:21.166 --> 18:23.836
But I ordered it because

18:23.902 --> 18:26.605
I love you. (laughs)

18:26.672 --> 18:29.508
I just want to get married
and eat cake and stop bickering

18:29.575 --> 18:31.643
{\an5}over wedding stuff.

18:29.575 --> 18:31.643
Yeah.

18:31.710 --> 18:33.779
{\an3}Ooh, did I tell you
that Donna's ordained?

18:33.846 --> 18:35.614
Sorry, um...

18:35.681 --> 18:38.450
{\an1}This is, this...
this is just a lot.

18:38.517 --> 18:39.518
(scoffs) It's not a lot,

18:39.585 --> 18:41.687
that's the point.
It's just an easy, simple way

18:41.753 --> 18:44.323
to get married without fighting.

18:44.389 --> 18:45.491
That's not why
we've been fighting.

18:45.557 --> 18:47.593
{\an3}You stopped talking to me
for a day over place cards.

18:47.659 --> 18:49.561
I slept with someone else.

18:51.396 --> 18:52.498
What?

18:52.564 --> 18:54.399
{\an1}The week before
you proposed.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.535
But it...
it didn't mean anything,

18:56.602 --> 18:59.638
and it was, it was a one-time
thing, and I love you.

18:59.705 --> 19:03.575
{\an3}You love me, but then
you cheated on me?

19:03.642 --> 19:05.377
I-I-I do.

19:05.444 --> 19:07.579
I do love you,

19:07.646 --> 19:09.381
and I want to marry you,
but before we do,

19:09.448 --> 19:11.517
{\an1}I...

19:11.583 --> 19:14.520
{\an1}I just needed you
to know.

19:14.586 --> 19:17.656
{\an3}Well...

19:17.723 --> 19:19.625
{\an3}now I know.

19:30.702 --> 19:32.437
{\an1}RANDY:
Hey!

19:32.504 --> 19:33.672
{\an6}SAM:
Aw.

19:32.504 --> 19:33.672
There he is.

19:33.739 --> 19:34.673
{\an5}Dad.

19:33.739 --> 19:34.673
{\an1}SAM:
Hey, kiddo.

19:34.740 --> 19:35.908
{\an5}Oh.

19:34.740 --> 19:35.908
{\an1}Oh.

19:35.974 --> 19:36.808
{\an3}GRIFF:
Okay.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.510
{\an1}RANDY:
Hey, buddy. Oh!

19:38.577 --> 19:39.611
{\an3}(kisses)

19:39.678 --> 19:40.512
Mmm.

19:41.647 --> 19:42.514
{\an3}KEVIN:
What happened to your leg?

19:42.581 --> 19:43.849
{\an1}Aw, don't ask.
(chuckles)

19:43.916 --> 19:45.717
What about you, huh?

19:45.784 --> 19:48.453
How many kids in school
survive a bus crash

19:48.520 --> 19:49.688
and have heart surgery

19:49.755 --> 19:51.823
{\an5}in the same day, hmm?

19:49.755 --> 19:51.823
We're all in one piece,

19:51.890 --> 19:53.692
and we're together.
That's what matters.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.528
So, we can go home?

19:56.595 --> 19:59.598
{\an1}Well, you will be ready
to discharge very soon, Kevin.

19:59.665 --> 20:02.601
And I see here that your mom
finally let us examine her.

20:02.668 --> 20:04.603
She's okay
except for a couple bruises,

20:04.670 --> 20:05.737
and she can go at any time.

20:05.804 --> 20:08.373
{\an6}And my dad?

20:05.804 --> 20:08.373
{\an1}GRIFF:
Uh, well,

20:08.440 --> 20:09.608
his leg is healing.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.643
{\an4}SAM:
Mm-hmm.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.643
It's gonna be fine.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.845
But your blood levels
are still falling.

20:13.912 --> 20:16.415
{\an6}SAM:
The laceration that
we saw on your scan

20:16.481 --> 20:17.583
is still bleeding.

20:17.649 --> 20:18.750
You need a blood transfusion,

20:18.817 --> 20:20.919
but our blood bank is depleted,

20:20.986 --> 20:22.955
our supply has not arrived yet,

20:23.021 --> 20:24.656
{\an1}and you have
a rare blood type.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.225
{\an5}Can I donate to him?

20:24.723 --> 20:27.225
{\an1}SAM:
Uh,

20:27.292 --> 20:29.761
no. You're B,
and Randy is type AB.

20:29.828 --> 20:32.931
I-I got some blood
during my surgery.

20:32.998 --> 20:33.966
You sure did.

20:34.032 --> 20:35.634
{\an5}(chuckles)

20:34.032 --> 20:35.634
Last we had.

20:35.701 --> 20:37.669
O neg.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.805
{\an3}KEVIN:
What's O neg?

20:41.840 --> 20:43.976
{\an5}Uh, well,
that's your blood type.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.976
Uh-huh.

20:44.042 --> 20:46.578
{\an6}GRIFF:
It's very common.
It's, uh, it's known

20:46.645 --> 20:48.847
{\an5}as the universal donor.

20:46.645 --> 20:48.847
{\an3}KEVIN:
So,

20:48.914 --> 20:51.016
I can give some to my dad?

20:51.083 --> 20:53.452
Uh, well, technically, yes.

20:53.518 --> 20:55.253
{\an1}You could donate
to either of your parents,

20:55.320 --> 20:56.855
but neither of them
can donate to you.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.890
{\an3}Can I borrow
Kevin for an EKG?

20:58.957 --> 21:00.392
{\an4}Uh-huh.

20:58.957 --> 21:00.392
Sure.

21:00.459 --> 21:01.627
First take my blood.

21:01.693 --> 21:03.528
{\an5}I'm a universal donor.

21:01.693 --> 21:03.528
{\an1}GRIFF:
Yeah,

21:03.595 --> 21:05.998
but you just had heart surgery,
and you need it.

21:06.064 --> 21:08.433
Plus, you can't donate

21:08.500 --> 21:10.502
till you're 18.

21:10.569 --> 21:14.039
{\an1}Anyway, uh,
we would like to keep you here

21:14.106 --> 21:15.273
{\an6}until...

21:14.106 --> 21:15.273
Wait a minute.

21:15.340 --> 21:16.942
For him to be O,

21:17.009 --> 21:19.344
doesn't one of us have to be O?

21:19.411 --> 21:22.280
{\an6}Uh...

21:19.411 --> 21:22.280
{\an1}Genetically speaking,
it is, um...

21:22.347 --> 21:24.583
{\an5}Is he not my son?

21:22.347 --> 21:24.583
{\an1}What?

21:24.650 --> 21:26.351
What kind of a question is that?

21:26.418 --> 21:28.820
If I'm AB and you're B,
Kevin can't be O.

21:28.887 --> 21:30.789
It's genetically impossible.
Unless he's not

21:30.856 --> 21:32.424
{\an6}my son.

21:30.856 --> 21:32.424
Of course he's your son.

21:32.491 --> 21:33.692
Then how do you explain
the blood?

21:33.759 --> 21:35.794
I don't know.
I'm-I'm not a doctor.

21:35.861 --> 21:38.597
Okay. Doctors,

21:38.664 --> 21:41.299
{\an3}i-is there another
explanation?

21:45.037 --> 21:47.005
I'm not Kevin's father.

21:55.681 --> 21:56.915
{\an5}I took her vitals an hour ago.

21:55.681 --> 21:56.915
Did you notice

21:56.982 --> 21:57.949
her pulse was
all over the place?

21:58.016 --> 21:59.851
Stop this, both of you.
I am fine.

21:59.918 --> 22:01.353
Her heart rate was normal.

22:01.420 --> 22:02.721
{\an4}GRIFF:
You can't depend
on the instruments.

22:02.788 --> 22:03.789
You have to do it manually.

22:03.855 --> 22:05.891
{\an5}I did do it manually.

22:03.855 --> 22:05.891
{\an1}Well,

22:05.957 --> 22:06.992
her blood pressure's rising.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.060
Gee, I wonder why that is.

22:08.126 --> 22:09.428
{\an1}RHONDA:
Some people will do

22:09.494 --> 22:10.962
anything for a day off.

22:11.029 --> 22:12.998
(chuckles)

22:13.065 --> 22:14.666
You look good.

22:14.733 --> 22:16.368
I'm glad to see it.

22:16.435 --> 22:17.969
Well, back at you.

22:18.036 --> 22:19.738
Your splenic lac patient.

22:19.805 --> 22:21.740
{\an5}What about him?

22:19.805 --> 22:21.740
{\an1}RHONDA:
I need to do an ultrasound

22:21.807 --> 22:23.742
of his leg, make sure
there isn't any nerve damage

22:23.809 --> 22:24.910
that needs my attention.

22:24.976 --> 22:26.044
Be my guest.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.014
{\an5}Feel better.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.014
I will.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.483
I'm not gonna make it that easy
for you to take my job.

22:31.550 --> 22:34.419
I don't want it if you have
to die for me to get it.

22:34.486 --> 22:36.722
That's more your family's style,
isn't it?

22:36.788 --> 22:38.757
{\an5}Ooh. (exhales)

22:36.788 --> 22:38.757
{\an1}I take issue
with that statement.

22:38.824 --> 22:40.125
{\an5}Me, too.

22:38.824 --> 22:40.125
{\an1}GRIFF:
I technically

22:40.192 --> 22:42.594
did not die. I was in
a persistent vegetative state.

22:42.661 --> 22:44.763
{\an3}VIVIAN:
Okay, thank you all for coming.

22:44.830 --> 22:46.298
{\an5}Now get out.

22:44.830 --> 22:46.298
{\an3}SAM:
Okay.

22:47.432 --> 22:48.734
{\an5}Vivi?

22:47.432 --> 22:48.734
{\an1}Mom?

22:50.068 --> 22:52.037
{\an5}You dizzy?

22:50.068 --> 22:52.037
{\an3}VIVIAN:
Yeah, no, I just...

22:52.104 --> 22:53.972
{\an5}I sat up too quickly.

22:52.104 --> 22:53.972
{\an1}GRIFF:
Okay. Okay.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.574
{\an5}Here. Hey, hey, hey.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.574
{\an3}(exhales)

22:55.640 --> 22:56.742
Follow my finger.

22:56.808 --> 22:58.744
{\an1}SAM:
Delayed tracking.

22:58.810 --> 23:00.112
Yeah. Let's get a CT angio

23:00.178 --> 23:01.646
{\an5}of her neck.

23:00.178 --> 23:01.646
Yeah.

23:01.713 --> 23:02.814
Why are you interested
in the blood vessels

23:02.881 --> 23:03.949
of my neck?

23:04.015 --> 23:05.784
Mom, how's your vision?

23:05.851 --> 23:07.953
Yeah, I guess it's a bit blurry.

23:08.019 --> 23:10.122
{\an1}GRIFF:
Okay, it could be

23:10.188 --> 23:12.891
a little more than a concussion.
Okay?

23:12.958 --> 23:15.427
{\an5}I'm gonna go down to Neurology.

23:12.958 --> 23:15.427
{\an1}Yeah.

23:16.461 --> 23:18.029
{\an5}(monitor beeping loudly)

23:16.461 --> 23:18.029
Just stop lying already!

23:18.096 --> 23:19.564
Randy, I told you,

23:19.631 --> 23:21.133
{\an5}it has to be a mistake.

23:19.631 --> 23:21.133
No, the mistake

23:21.199 --> 23:22.834
was me trusting you.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.436
I need two milligrams
of IV lorazepam.

23:24.503 --> 23:26.071
{\an1}We just got our family
back together,

23:26.138 --> 23:27.405
{\an1}and now you're
blowing it apart.

23:27.472 --> 23:29.040
{\an1}What's gonna happen
when Kevin finds out?

23:29.107 --> 23:31.643
{\an5}There's nothing
for Kevin to find out, Randy.

23:29.107 --> 23:31.643
RANDY: He deserves

23:31.710 --> 23:33.678
{\an5}to know the truth!

23:31.710 --> 23:33.678
{\an3}SAM: All right, all
right. He's tachycardic.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.147
Randy, I need you to calm down.

23:35.213 --> 23:37.415
Then tell my wife
to not cheat on me.

23:37.482 --> 23:38.884
Okay.

23:38.950 --> 23:40.952
What is that?

23:45.023 --> 23:46.558
(elevator bell dings)

23:48.026 --> 23:48.994
{\an3}Hey.

23:49.060 --> 23:50.662
{\an4}Hey.

23:49.060 --> 23:50.662
(pager beeping)

23:50.729 --> 23:52.430
{\an3}So...

23:52.497 --> 23:53.932
{\an1}ER again.

23:53.999 --> 23:55.834
{\an3}Haven't you put out
enough fires down there?

23:55.901 --> 23:56.968
They need the help.

23:57.035 --> 24:00.005
{\an3}They have their own residents,
and the storm is over.

24:00.071 --> 24:02.107
{\an3}Do you want me to tell
them to back off?

24:03.642 --> 24:06.478
Oh, or am I doing that thing

24:06.545 --> 24:08.680
where I offer to
handle something

24:08.747 --> 24:11.149
that you're perfectly capable
of handling by yourself?

24:11.216 --> 24:12.617
{\an1}(gasps)
What...?

24:12.684 --> 24:15.387
{\an5}You are learning.

24:12.684 --> 24:15.387
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.789
I know you like trauma,

24:17.856 --> 24:20.492
{\an3}but you committed
to CT, and...

24:20.559 --> 24:21.927
{\an1}And CT takes
total commitment.

24:21.993 --> 24:23.628
{\an1}I know.
We talked about this.

24:23.695 --> 24:25.730
You're on track to
be chief resident

24:25.797 --> 24:27.999
{\an3}of the most prestigious
department at this hospital.

24:28.066 --> 24:31.236
{\an3}Right now, nobody
can compete with you.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.705
{\an3}But if you're not
all in, then...

24:35.707 --> 24:37.676
{\an3}...I don't know how
that'll be true.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.814
{\an4}SAM:
Fever and a rash
with a rising lactate.

24:42.881 --> 24:44.616
{\an3}CALEB:
Could be infection.

24:44.683 --> 24:46.718
{\an1}Yeah,
but chest X-ray was clear,

24:46.785 --> 24:48.486
{\an3}and blood cultures
were negative.

24:48.553 --> 24:50.555
Rhonda was worried
about complications

24:50.622 --> 24:52.123
from a crush injury.

24:52.190 --> 24:54.092
{\an5}Any chance they're related?

24:52.190 --> 24:54.092
(pager beeping)

24:56.561 --> 24:58.930
{\an5}Lex?

24:56.561 --> 24:58.930
Hmm? Oh, um...

24:58.997 --> 25:01.132
Mm, it's unlikely.

25:01.199 --> 25:02.834
I mean, there's no signs
of rhabdomyolysis,

25:02.901 --> 25:05.503
{\an5}and his urine output
is normal, so...

25:02.901 --> 25:05.503
(pager beeping)

25:06.938 --> 25:08.139
Sorry.

25:08.206 --> 25:09.541
Okay.

25:09.608 --> 25:10.775
{\an1}Let's run

25:10.842 --> 25:12.210
repeat blood and urine cultures

25:12.277 --> 25:13.712
and broaden his antibiotics.

25:13.778 --> 25:15.814
{\an3}Could it be a
stress response?

25:15.881 --> 25:18.650
To his wife's affair?

25:18.717 --> 25:20.719
I don't have a prescription
for that.

25:20.785 --> 25:22.554
Don't date a cheater.

25:22.621 --> 25:24.089
What did you say?

25:25.657 --> 25:27.025
(scoffs)
That would be my advice

25:27.092 --> 25:28.994
for someone who doesn't want
to be cheated on.

25:29.060 --> 25:31.963
So it was his fault
that he didn't psychically know

25:32.030 --> 25:34.733
that his partner was unfaithful?

25:34.799 --> 25:36.568
No, not his fault.

25:36.635 --> 25:38.303
But, like, you know,
if she cheated,

25:38.370 --> 25:39.971
she was probably unhappy.

25:40.038 --> 25:42.207
He has some part in that.

25:42.274 --> 25:44.242
Wow. Romance advice

25:44.309 --> 25:45.877
from someone who's never heard
of a second date.

25:45.944 --> 25:47.245
Thanks for the tip.

25:48.813 --> 25:50.982
{\an6}SAM:
The wife swears that she
did not have an affair.

25:51.049 --> 25:53.618
She's convinced
that it's something else.

25:53.685 --> 25:56.154
{\an1}Well, there's only one
I can think of. Chimerism.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.657
{\an1}He could have blood cells
with distinct

25:58.723 --> 25:59.724
and different genotypes.

25:59.791 --> 26:01.092
Part of him is type AB.

26:01.159 --> 26:03.061
The other part is type O.

26:03.128 --> 26:04.829
{\an3}SAM:
And that part made Kevin.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.565
I've never seen a
genetic chimera.

26:07.632 --> 26:09.067
It can't hurt to test him.

26:09.134 --> 26:11.136
{\an1}Okay, so I'll send some blood
to my geneticist friend

26:11.202 --> 26:12.938
{\an5}in Boston.

26:11.202 --> 26:12.938
{\an3}Okay.

26:13.004 --> 26:14.940
See?

26:15.006 --> 26:17.208
I do take you seriously.

26:17.275 --> 26:18.910
Okay. Thank you.

26:18.977 --> 26:20.745
And I don't.

26:20.812 --> 26:22.247
{\an3}Okay.

26:22.314 --> 26:23.982
And it's a good thing.

26:24.049 --> 26:26.718
Caleb,
I need something in my life

26:26.785 --> 26:29.621
that is not so serious.

26:29.688 --> 26:32.023
{\an1}And you have been that
for me for so long,

26:32.090 --> 26:34.659
{\an1}I don't know
what I would do without it.

26:34.726 --> 26:37.662
{\an1}I don't know what I would do
without you, Caleb.

26:37.729 --> 26:40.665
{\an1}And that is seriously
how I feel.

26:41.833 --> 26:44.102
I hope it's enough for you.

26:44.169 --> 26:46.838
(pager beeping)

26:47.872 --> 26:49.007
{\an5}<i>(alarm beeping)</i>

26:47.872 --> 26:49.007
<i>Mom.</i>

26:49.074 --> 26:50.375
What's happening?

26:50.442 --> 26:51.910
{\an3}LEE:
Vertebral artery dissection.

26:51.977 --> 26:53.845
{\an3}Vessel must've
sheared in the crash.

26:53.912 --> 26:55.981
{\an5}How did we miss this?

26:53.912 --> 26:55.981
Delayed onset.

26:56.047 --> 26:57.649
{\an1}Contralateral vert
is hypoplastic.

26:57.716 --> 26:59.751
{\an3}Not enough flow
to her brain stem.

26:59.818 --> 27:01.753
She could hemorrhage if we
don't get her into surgery.

27:01.820 --> 27:02.887
{\an1}Okay.

27:02.954 --> 27:04.823
You are gonna be okay, Mom.

27:04.889 --> 27:06.224
And I'm here.

27:11.696 --> 27:13.164
{\an1}Baum's doing your surgery.
You don't get better than him.

27:13.231 --> 27:14.666
{\an3}I know. Who do you
think recruited him?

27:14.733 --> 27:16.401
When you get out,
you're gonna have

27:16.468 --> 27:18.103
the best neurointensivists
I know.

27:18.169 --> 27:19.671
You are going
to get through this.

27:19.738 --> 27:22.073
{\an3}What about us? Are we
gonna get through this?

27:22.140 --> 27:24.642
{\an5}Don't think about that
right now, Mom.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.642
I thought I was doing

27:24.709 --> 27:28.113
{\an3}the right thing. I thought I
was protecting the right baby.

27:28.179 --> 27:29.247
{\an4}Vivi.

27:28.179 --> 27:29.247
{\an3}Mom, I...

27:32.250 --> 27:34.352
{\an1}ISAN:
Even if Randy has chimerism,

27:34.419 --> 27:36.421
{\an1}doesn't explain
any of these other symptoms.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.323
{\an3}Well, we've ruled out
tissue infection.

27:38.390 --> 27:39.357
The wound site was
completely clean.

27:39.424 --> 27:42.160
{\an4}This seems like
a respiratory infection.

27:39.424 --> 27:42.160
{\an3}It does,

27:42.227 --> 27:44.195
but when would he have inhaled
bacterial particulate?

27:44.262 --> 27:47.098
He was trapped
under that crate...

27:47.165 --> 27:48.133
Wait a minute.

27:48.199 --> 27:49.801
{\an3}Tularemia.

27:49.868 --> 27:51.169
{\an5}Isn't that bacterial?

27:49.868 --> 27:51.169
{\an1}Mm.

27:51.236 --> 27:52.270
It comes from, like,
rabbits and...

27:52.337 --> 27:53.838
{\an5}Rodents.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.838
{\an3}Right.

27:53.905 --> 27:55.440
If that farm truck
was transporting livestock...

27:55.507 --> 27:58.243
The crate that landed on him
could've been contaminated

27:58.309 --> 27:59.677
{\an5}with rabbit feces.

27:58.309 --> 27:59.677
{\an3}CALEB:
All right, I'm gonna order

27:59.744 --> 28:01.079
{\an6}the labs.

27:59.744 --> 28:01.079
I'll call the farm

28:01.146 --> 28:02.781
and see
what livestock they breed.

28:02.847 --> 28:06.151
I'll get the Scooby Snacks
and fire up the Mystery Machine.

28:06.217 --> 28:08.219
{\an1}Don't you have a surgery
to prepare for?

28:08.286 --> 28:09.187
{\an3}I do.

28:09.254 --> 28:11.790
{\an3}Because I was chosen
for it and you weren't,

28:11.856 --> 28:13.758
which obviously bothers you.

28:13.825 --> 28:15.427
If it's not plastics,
I'm not interested.

28:15.493 --> 28:18.196
{\an3}You're the one who's always
saying this is a competition.

28:18.263 --> 28:19.697
And you don't like losing.

28:19.764 --> 28:21.733
Mm, but if the prize for winning
is rabbit poop,

28:21.800 --> 28:23.701
{\an5}I'm fine with it.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.701
No, you're not.

28:23.768 --> 28:25.203
And you shouldn't be.

28:25.270 --> 28:27.372
It's a big surgery.
And it's not a good look

28:27.439 --> 28:29.074
that you keep
getting passed over.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.709
If I wanted your surgery,
I'd have it.

28:31.776 --> 28:33.378
(clicks tongue)

28:42.787 --> 28:45.790
{\an5}How's he doing?

28:42.787 --> 28:45.790
{\an1}Strong blood flow
to his lower extremities

28:45.857 --> 28:48.259
and no nerve damage.
My work here is done.

28:48.326 --> 28:49.861
That's good news.

28:49.928 --> 28:52.097
Uh, though, to be honest,

28:52.163 --> 28:54.365
{\an3}I was looking forward
to a fem-pop.

28:54.432 --> 28:56.201
{\an1}Even if I did need
to perform

28:56.267 --> 28:57.335
a femoropopliteal procedure,

28:57.402 --> 29:00.038
{\an1}what makes you think
you'd be assisting me?

29:00.105 --> 29:02.240
{\an3}I plan to subspecialize
in plastics.

29:02.307 --> 29:03.441
I was sure you knew that.

29:05.343 --> 29:07.412
{\an3}I-I may have been a
little distracted lately.

29:07.479 --> 29:10.315
{\an3}I got engaged.
It's complicated.

29:10.381 --> 29:14.152
{\an3}But, uh, Dr. Glass,
plastics is my passion,

29:14.219 --> 29:16.454
{\an6}and I...

29:14.219 --> 29:16.454
{\an1}You know
what my passion is?

29:16.521 --> 29:18.523
Undeniable surgeons.

29:18.590 --> 29:22.260
{\an1}When I was a resident,
everybody wanted me.

29:22.327 --> 29:24.162
Every specialty,
every surgery, every day.

29:24.229 --> 29:27.098
When's the last time
you were first assist?

29:27.165 --> 29:31.169
Instead of presuming to know
what I think or whom I want,

29:31.236 --> 29:33.371
{\an1}you might want to acquaint
yourself with the OR.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.440
{\an1}Doctor.

29:38.276 --> 29:39.144
{\an1}LEX:
Kace.

29:39.210 --> 29:41.112
I got your page,
but I couldn't get away.

29:41.179 --> 29:42.514
{\an3}We got an emergent
cricothyrotomy on the way.

29:42.580 --> 29:44.115
{\an3}I figured you wouldn't
want to miss it.

29:44.182 --> 29:45.450
I don't.

29:45.517 --> 29:49.087
But I have to ease up on my...
my trauma rotations.

29:49.154 --> 29:51.222
CT is so demanding.

29:51.289 --> 29:52.524
I already lost a surgery.

29:52.590 --> 29:54.859
I can't be here and there
at the same time.

29:54.926 --> 29:57.228
So stay here.

29:59.931 --> 30:02.367
I can't just change
my specialty track.

30:02.433 --> 30:03.835
Uh, yeah. Sure, you can.

30:03.902 --> 30:05.203
People do it all the time.

30:05.270 --> 30:07.372
Right,
but I've put years into CT.

30:07.438 --> 30:09.541
{\an1}If I switch,
I'd be starting over

30:09.607 --> 30:10.808
from scratch.

30:10.875 --> 30:12.544
If you hadn't been here today,

30:12.610 --> 30:13.811
that patient
with the crush injury

30:13.878 --> 30:16.247
would be dead,
and we both know it.

30:16.314 --> 30:18.449
You don't just have
talent, Dr. Trulie.

30:18.516 --> 30:20.084
You have passion,
which you're gonna need

30:20.151 --> 30:22.086
where-wherever you specialize.

30:22.153 --> 30:23.087
{\an3}TIM:
Gavin Larousse, 35.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.223
{\an3}Respiratory distress
with a worsening angioedema.

30:25.290 --> 30:28.226
{\an3}His tongue is obstructing
his airway.

30:28.293 --> 30:31.062
{\an1}Orotracheal and nasotracheal
intubation is impossible.

30:31.129 --> 30:32.864
Okay, let's go.

30:32.931 --> 30:35.400
You sure you want to
leave Trauma behind?

30:38.436 --> 30:42.073
{\an4}Hey.

30:38.436 --> 30:42.073
I know it's a competition.

30:42.140 --> 30:44.943
{\an3}This job.

30:45.009 --> 30:48.913
I fight for my spot here
every day, which is hard.

30:48.980 --> 30:51.583
I know. I know.

30:51.649 --> 30:53.952
{\an3}And whenever I needed to
remember why I was doing it,

30:54.018 --> 30:56.521
{\an3}what I was actually
fighting for,

30:56.588 --> 30:59.023
I looked at you.

30:59.090 --> 31:00.959
And then you did what you did,

31:01.025 --> 31:02.560
{\an3}and now I don't know
where to look.

31:02.627 --> 31:04.162
{\an1}Joey...

31:04.229 --> 31:05.997
You know what, maybe

31:06.064 --> 31:07.599
I've taken too much for granted.

31:07.665 --> 31:09.934
{\an3}Maybe...

31:10.001 --> 31:11.336
Maybe I just haven't
fought hard enough.

31:11.402 --> 31:13.338
You don't have to fight for me,
I am right here.

31:15.306 --> 31:17.208
I'm not talking about you.

31:25.316 --> 31:27.218
Hello, Patricia.

31:27.285 --> 31:28.620
Ready for your surgery?

31:28.686 --> 31:29.754
(gasps)

31:29.821 --> 31:32.924
Is anybody ever ready to have
their lung taken out?

31:32.991 --> 31:35.260
Has somebody walked you through
the procedure, what to expect?

31:35.326 --> 31:37.128
{\an1}Yes.

31:35.326 --> 31:37.128
{\an3}Yeah?

31:37.195 --> 31:38.429
Dr. Shah was here.

31:38.496 --> 31:41.633
Oh, good.
He needs a second chance.

31:41.699 --> 31:43.935
What do you mean?

31:44.002 --> 31:45.536
Oh, I-I assumed you knew.

31:45.603 --> 31:47.005
{\an3}I mean, I think
it's public record

31:47.071 --> 31:49.540
that he lost a patient.

31:49.607 --> 31:50.608
Lost?

31:50.675 --> 31:51.609
Oh, it wasn't his fault.

31:51.676 --> 31:52.644
At least, I don't think it was.

31:52.710 --> 31:54.946
But he's struggled

31:55.013 --> 31:56.581
with confidence since then.
Oh...

31:56.648 --> 32:00.551
The patient he lost,
was it a lung removal?

32:00.618 --> 32:02.654
{\an3}Appendectomy, actually.
A much simpler procedure.

32:08.059 --> 32:10.094
The OR was always
her favorite place.

32:10.161 --> 32:13.364
I just never imagined her
on the table.

32:15.166 --> 32:17.135
What did she mean,

32:17.201 --> 32:19.404
{\an5}"protecting the right baby"?

32:17.201 --> 32:19.404
{\an1}(chuckles)

32:19.470 --> 32:21.539
She used to say
she had two babies:

32:21.606 --> 32:22.974
you and the hospital.

32:23.041 --> 32:24.208
She was in Orthopedics.

32:24.275 --> 32:26.311
Long hours, a lot of pressure.

32:26.377 --> 32:28.246
She did it all.

32:28.313 --> 32:31.249
She loved being a doctor.

32:31.316 --> 32:34.152
I felt it out there today.

32:34.218 --> 32:38.456
But I also feel like she's been
running the hospital

32:38.523 --> 32:40.224
for as long as I can remember.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.427
Well, it was a long time ago.

32:42.493 --> 32:45.596
When was it, exactly?

32:45.663 --> 32:48.733
(sighs)
Well...

32:48.800 --> 32:53.204
after the accident,
you had a hard time.

32:53.271 --> 32:54.739
Night terrors,

32:54.806 --> 32:56.441
panic attacks.

32:56.507 --> 32:58.443
You couldn't be alone.

32:58.509 --> 33:01.079
I couldn't be with you,
as we know.

33:01.145 --> 33:06.017
So your mom decided
that she would be.

33:06.084 --> 33:09.220
She gave up being a doctor
after the accident?

33:11.155 --> 33:12.590
She gave it up for me?

33:12.657 --> 33:16.494
Admin gave her reliable hours.

33:16.561 --> 33:19.330
Home for dinner every day.

33:19.397 --> 33:21.366
She knew it was what you needed.

33:21.432 --> 33:24.335
How did I never know this?

33:24.402 --> 33:28.740
{\an1}She didn't want you to know.
She would never tell you.

33:28.806 --> 33:33.177
{\an1}But I was there.
I saw it.

33:33.244 --> 33:36.314
She gave everything to you.

33:36.381 --> 33:38.616
And then, when you didn't

33:38.683 --> 33:40.351
{\an5}need her so much...

33:38.683 --> 33:40.351
(door opens)

33:42.587 --> 33:44.422
...she gave it to them.

33:49.260 --> 33:51.262
♪ ♪

34:00.605 --> 34:02.707
GRIFF:
We're all in this together, Sam.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.489
{\an5}How's the patient?

34:16.888 --> 34:19.489
{\an3}Uh...

34:19.556 --> 34:22.393
{\an3}They repaired
her dissection.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.061
We're just waiting
for her to wake up.

34:24.128 --> 34:26.230
{\an5}I mean, she-she did great.

34:24.128 --> 34:26.230
How are you doing?

34:26.297 --> 34:28.565
{\an1}I'm okay.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.670
{\an1}I'm tired.

34:34.138 --> 34:35.639
Is there anything I can do?

34:35.706 --> 34:39.342
You could tell your mom to
stop looking into my dad.

34:40.578 --> 34:44.415
{\an3}He has been dealing
with something personal,

34:44.482 --> 34:47.118
but it is nothing for your
mom to be concerned about.

34:47.185 --> 34:48.119
{\an3}He's okay.

34:49.353 --> 34:50.822
Are you?

34:53.224 --> 34:54.725
I am...

34:56.561 --> 34:57.495
I don't know.

34:57.562 --> 34:58.763
It's okay. Come here.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.466
{\an3}I know that your mom is
just doing her job.

35:01.532 --> 35:03.734
Hey, don't-don't worry
about her.

35:03.801 --> 35:07.338
All right?
I will talk to her. Okay?

35:07.405 --> 35:08.840
All right? Come here.

35:08.906 --> 35:10.608
All right? It's gonna be okay.

35:23.688 --> 35:26.424
Okay, Patricia, it is time...

35:26.491 --> 35:27.692
Where is my patient?

35:27.758 --> 35:30.428
In surgery.
They moved it up.

35:30.495 --> 35:32.897
Why wasn't I told?

35:32.964 --> 35:34.699
{\an1}GRIFF:
Hey.

35:34.765 --> 35:36.133
Hey.

35:37.768 --> 35:38.803
How's she doing?

35:38.870 --> 35:41.372
{\an5}She's stable.

35:38.870 --> 35:41.372
{\an3}Good.

35:41.439 --> 35:43.140
Trauma still chasing you?

35:43.207 --> 35:45.810
Actually, I talked to
the program director

35:45.877 --> 35:47.645
about changing specialties.

35:47.712 --> 35:49.213
What?

35:49.280 --> 35:51.716
I just did an emergent cric.

35:51.782 --> 35:55.152
{\an3}This patient's tongue
was so swollen

35:55.219 --> 35:57.855
I had to hyperextend his neck to
cut the cricothyroid membrane.

35:57.922 --> 36:00.157
{\an6}It was...

35:57.922 --> 36:00.157
Electrifying.

36:00.224 --> 36:01.792
{\an6}Yeah.

36:00.224 --> 36:01.792
Yeah, I know the feeling.

36:01.859 --> 36:04.795
{\an1}But I get it from
heart surgery.

36:04.862 --> 36:09.333
{\an3}Uh, yeah, I mean, I'll still
rotate through CT,

36:09.400 --> 36:12.303
{\an3}but the ER will be
my home base.

36:12.370 --> 36:13.704
Hmm.

36:13.771 --> 36:15.740
{\an3}I know you think
ER doctors are inferior.

36:15.806 --> 36:19.510
{\an1}I think <i> some</i> ER doctors
are inferior.

36:19.577 --> 36:23.314
{\an1}You're an excellent surgeon,
whatever...

36:23.381 --> 36:25.182
color scrubs you wear.

36:25.249 --> 36:27.184
{\an5}Trauma surgery's no joke.

36:25.249 --> 36:27.184
{\an3}Mm-mm.

36:27.251 --> 36:28.686
Dr. Trulie,

36:28.753 --> 36:31.689
they'll be lucky to have you.

36:33.558 --> 36:34.759
I'm lucky to have you.

36:34.825 --> 36:36.761
{\an4}Mm-hmm.

36:34.825 --> 36:36.761
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

36:36.827 --> 36:39.797
{\an5}GRIFF:
<i>Of course, I think</i>
<i>it's a big mistake.</i>

36:39.864 --> 36:43.834
{\an3}I mean, who trades CT for sore
throats and sprained ankles?

36:43.901 --> 36:47.538
I can't weigh in on such
a big decision for her.

36:47.605 --> 36:50.708
That's all I need,
some other woman

36:50.775 --> 36:52.944
rearranging her life
because of me.

36:58.316 --> 37:02.620
You scared me, Viv.
I thought I lost you.

37:02.687 --> 37:04.422
I started thinking about
everything

37:04.488 --> 37:06.824
we've been through together.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.593
And, uh...

37:11.896 --> 37:14.298
...you're the love of my life.

37:17.034 --> 37:19.670
So get out of bed, will you?

37:21.973 --> 37:23.841
{\an3}Your husband has
pneumatic tularemia,

37:23.908 --> 37:26.243
{\an1}so we've started him on
targeted antibiotics,

37:26.310 --> 37:28.279
{\an3}and he should be
feeling better soon.

37:28.346 --> 37:31.382
Oh, good.
That's a relief.

37:31.449 --> 37:33.784
And we also spoke to
the genetics lab,

37:33.851 --> 37:36.387
and Randy does not have
chimerism,

37:36.454 --> 37:38.823
or any other genetic anomaly
that would explain why

37:38.889 --> 37:40.925
he has different
DNA than Kevin.

37:45.563 --> 37:46.764
It was just a fling.

37:46.831 --> 37:49.000
{\an1}Over before it began,
practically.

37:49.066 --> 37:51.602
And when I realized
I was pregnant,

37:51.669 --> 37:54.372
Randy assumed the baby was his.

37:54.438 --> 37:57.908
I wanted it to be his.

37:57.975 --> 37:59.443
And I also thought

37:59.510 --> 38:02.480
{\an3}what good would it do to
tell him about the affair?

38:02.546 --> 38:04.315
Who would it help?

38:04.382 --> 38:06.617
That's a long time
to carry a secret.

38:06.684 --> 38:09.654
But in my experience,

38:09.720 --> 38:12.289
it's better to deal
with the truth

38:12.356 --> 38:14.725
than to hide from it.

38:16.594 --> 38:19.797
{\an5}(pager beeping)

38:16.594 --> 38:19.797
(sighs)

38:19.864 --> 38:21.832
{\an1}Excuse me.

38:27.772 --> 38:29.707
Mom, you're awake.

38:29.774 --> 38:31.542
How do you feel?

38:31.609 --> 38:33.878
Like I just had major surgery.

38:33.944 --> 38:38.783
{\an1}Mom, I-I remember when
you made the switch to Admin.

38:38.849 --> 38:41.519
I didn't know that
I was the reason.

38:41.585 --> 38:43.487
Dad told me.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.625
I never wanted you
to feel like

38:47.692 --> 38:50.895
I gave something up
because of you.

38:50.961 --> 38:52.863
But you did.

38:52.930 --> 38:54.765
You gave up something
that you love

38:54.832 --> 38:56.534
as much as I do.

38:56.600 --> 38:59.070
I cannot imagine
giving this up.

38:59.136 --> 39:01.505
I did love it.

39:01.572 --> 39:05.910
But I was also so happy

39:05.976 --> 39:09.547
to spend time with you

39:09.613 --> 39:12.550
and watch you grow into

39:12.616 --> 39:15.586
what you've become.

39:15.653 --> 39:17.855
I'm so proud of you.

39:17.922 --> 39:22.126
I'm so sorry I accused you of
putting the hospital first.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.495
And I'm sorry

39:24.562 --> 39:26.130
{\an3}I kept the truth
from you for so long.

39:28.799 --> 39:31.035
What do you say we stop
apologizing to each other

39:31.102 --> 39:33.471
and finally put this accident
behind us?

39:33.537 --> 39:35.973
Mm. I would love to.

39:38.609 --> 39:41.612
{\an4}Oh...

39:38.609 --> 39:41.612
Oh, my girl.

39:41.679 --> 39:43.981
Oh...

39:46.183 --> 39:48.119
{\an1}ISAN:
This came for you.

39:48.185 --> 39:51.021
Oh. How could I forget?

39:58.796 --> 40:02.466
Yeah, I know what you did.

40:02.533 --> 40:03.801
Stealing my surgery.

40:03.868 --> 40:05.469
I didn't steal your surgery.

40:05.536 --> 40:07.638
{\an3}The patient changed her mind
after she knew the truth.

40:07.705 --> 40:10.074
Looks like your wedding's off.

40:10.141 --> 40:13.077
{\an1}I don't know what happened,
and I don't really care,

40:13.144 --> 40:15.045
but Tim dodged a bullet.

40:19.717 --> 40:21.418
See you on the next one.

40:22.787 --> 40:24.121
Dr. Trulie.

40:24.188 --> 40:26.657
{\an5}Reporting for duty.

40:24.188 --> 40:26.657
Not in those scrubs.

40:26.724 --> 40:28.592
{\an5}They're the wrong color.

40:26.724 --> 40:28.592
Right.

40:28.659 --> 40:29.927
{\an4}Follow me.

40:28.659 --> 40:29.927
Okay.

40:29.994 --> 40:31.796
Here's your schedule.

40:31.862 --> 40:34.498
All right. Whoa.

40:34.565 --> 40:36.600
There's a lot of night shifts.

40:36.667 --> 40:38.002
Yep. Goes by seniority.

40:38.068 --> 40:39.003
{\an1}Everybody starts
at the bottom.

40:41.839 --> 40:42.773
Here you go.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.108
Now, there's a kid in Bay 4

40:44.175 --> 40:46.610
with hand, foot,
and mouth disease. Ugh.

40:46.677 --> 40:47.611
Okay.

40:47.678 --> 40:49.580
{\an5}Welcome to the jungle.

40:47.678 --> 40:49.580
Yeah.

40:54.051 --> 40:56.987
CALEB:
Ooh, the truth hurts.

40:57.054 --> 40:58.889
{\an5}But it's better to know.

40:57.054 --> 40:58.889
{\an1}Yeah.

40:58.956 --> 41:01.492
She took my advice.

41:01.559 --> 41:03.160
I guess I should, too.

41:03.227 --> 41:04.862
About what?

41:04.929 --> 41:06.697
Us. Um, look,

41:06.764 --> 41:09.066
{\an3}I know I signed up
for casual,

41:09.133 --> 41:11.468
and I agreed to it,
and I'm good with it

41:11.535 --> 41:14.038
{\an3}as long as it's not
about Malcolm.

41:14.104 --> 41:15.506
Malcolm?

41:15.573 --> 41:16.974
{\an3}If you can't get serious
with me because

41:17.041 --> 41:19.643
{\an3}you still have feelings for him,
I just need to know.

41:20.678 --> 41:23.147
It's not about him.

41:23.214 --> 41:25.916
Casual's just where I am
right now.

41:25.983 --> 41:28.552
Well, then,
it's where I am, too.

41:28.619 --> 41:30.521
{\an1}Okay.

41:30.588 --> 41:31.755
{\an1}Do you want to go
to my place

41:31.822 --> 41:34.058
{\an5}and sleep in an actual bed?

41:31.822 --> 41:34.058
Yes, please.

41:34.124 --> 41:35.526
Good.

41:38.996 --> 41:42.833
A personal family matter, huh?

41:42.900 --> 41:45.536
{\an1}Sam's just asking for
a little privacy.

41:46.704 --> 41:49.073
Is it really your place to be
nosing around in his business?

41:49.139 --> 41:51.575
{\an3}I used to think that
Rob Griffith wasn't fit

41:51.642 --> 41:53.711
to be department chief,

41:53.777 --> 41:55.946
{\an3}but he shouldn't be a part
of this hospital at all.

41:56.013 --> 41:57.915
What are you talking about?

41:57.982 --> 41:59.250
This.

41:59.316 --> 42:01.051
There's the truth.

42:01.118 --> 42:04.655
{\an3}You decide whose place it is
to do something about it.

42:08.692 --> 42:10.694
"Driving while intoxicated."
