05:19.713 --> 05:22.646

05:27.761 --> 05:31.064

After all, you are the family

06:01.457 --> 06:03.551
- that brought us Empire Entertainment.
- Exactly.

06:03.638 --> 06:06.245
That's why we trying
to follow this legacy up

06:06.332 --> 06:08.348
with, um, with an amazing artist.

06:08.435 --> 06:10.425
I'll tell you, once you
play this song from her...

06:10.512 --> 06:12.774
Yeah, we are, but before
we get into the future,

06:12.861 --> 06:14.911
man, let's stay in the past
for a minute.

06:15.073 --> 06:18.165
It's only been two years
since you lost Empire.

06:25.381 --> 06:27.134
All right, real talk, baby.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.817
You know, after doing
something for 20 years,

06:29.904 --> 06:32.927
y-you realize that sometimes,
it's time for a change.

06:33.014 --> 06:34.141
Now that's real talk.

06:34.228 --> 06:36.217
Well, real talk...
man, you know how that is.

06:36.304 --> 06:38.397
Real talk ain't real
until the streets say so.

06:38.484 --> 06:39.782
And according to the streets,

06:39.869 --> 06:42.092
you and Cookie just fell off
the face of the Earth,

06:42.179 --> 06:44.152
because you let your boy Eddie Barker

06:44.239 --> 06:47.376
just gorilla your whole company.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.514
Come here.

06:58.460 --> 07:01.567
You like your heart
being in your chest?

07:04.174 --> 07:06.103
You trying to play me?

07:06.334 --> 07:07.816
This is supposed to be an interview,

07:07.903 --> 07:10.206
not me putting
my personal business on blast

07:10.293 --> 07:11.778
like I'm on a reality show.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.712
Nothing's on blast if
the rumor's aren't true, right?

07:14.799 --> 07:16.344
You and me, we had a deal.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.993
I come in here, I get
on the radio with your boy.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.747
I did my part, now play my song

07:21.834 --> 07:24.177
and call your sister stations
up and down the coast.

07:24.264 --> 07:25.769
You tell them to play it as well.

07:25.856 --> 07:27.194
I can't do that, Lucious.

07:27.281 --> 07:30.063
No disrespect. But if you're not
willing to give us some dirt

07:30.150 --> 07:32.075
on what's really happening
with you and Cookie

07:32.162 --> 07:33.341
- and the Lyons...
- What's happening?

07:33.428 --> 07:35.076
This ain't about no damn dirt.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.739
This is supposed
to be about music, man.

07:37.826 --> 07:38.938
You know what's happening?

07:39.025 --> 07:42.963
You had an opportunity to break
the next Whitney Houston.

07:43.405 --> 07:44.857
You lost it.

07:57.037 --> 07:59.729
- Look at you.
- "Wack ass show."

07:59.816 --> 08:02.502
You giving somebody
a ass-whooping over the phone.

08:02.589 --> 08:05.526
I'm letting this radio
station have it on Twitter.

08:05.718 --> 08:07.515
They don't want it with me.
That's for sure.

08:07.602 --> 08:09.935
Ain't you supposed to be
in the studio with Treasure?

08:10.022 --> 08:12.022
I can chew gum and walk
at the same damn time.

08:12.109 --> 08:15.068
Lucious, they must have
forgot who we are.

08:15.155 --> 08:17.013
- Baby...
- Let me send this.

08:17.100 --> 08:18.807
- Come on.
- Troll.

08:18.894 --> 08:20.976
Look, I'm telling you, we got this.

08:21.063 --> 08:23.645
You get in the studio, you make
another hit with Treasure.

08:23.732 --> 08:26.411
I'll get this on the radio.

What's that for?

08:37.030 --> 08:38.642
I need a reason?

08:39.186 --> 08:40.894

He's innocent.

- He shouldn't even be here.
- You're almost out of here, Dre.

09:53.817 --> 09:55.885

What's this, one setback and you
run back back to your day job?

10:27.872 --> 10:29.532
Cookie, it's not just a job. Okay?

10:29.619 --> 10:31.731
I'm paying my bills.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.920
It's a pension, it's health care.

10:34.045 --> 10:35.915
And my daddy keeps telling me
I cannot run away

10:36.002 --> 10:37.690
from reality for a dream.

10:37.839 --> 10:41.736
You know, my daddy put food
on the table for three girls,

10:41.823 --> 10:43.854
with nothing but his toolbox

10:43.941 --> 10:47.667
and his bare, scarred, rough hands.

10:48.201 --> 10:49.388
And when I told my daddy

10:49.475 --> 10:51.174
I was leaving to pursue my dreams,

10:51.261 --> 10:53.826
he put his face in those
same hands and he cried.

10:54.147 --> 10:55.959
And you know what's unfortunate?

10:56.046 --> 10:58.448
He passed away
before he got to find out

10:58.535 --> 11:02.244
how I took every lesson
he taught me about hard work

11:02.331 --> 11:05.252
and I applied it to something
that woke my soul:

11:05.387 --> 11:07.235
music.

11:08.952 --> 11:11.595
I see greatness in you, sis.

11:11.983 --> 11:14.199
You call me when you see it
in yourself.

11:14.286 --> 11:17.017

11:22.014 --> 11:24.533

- Oh, my fault, dawg.
- Much respect, baby. - Oh, my-my bad.

12:06.028 --> 12:07.776
So what's up with the visit?

12:07.863 --> 12:10.086
I'm out of here in a few.
What, y'all miss me that much?

12:10.173 --> 12:12.199
- I actually do.
- I don't.

12:12.286 --> 12:14.616
And yet here you are, baby boy.

12:14.703 --> 12:16.885
- First time in a while, too.
- You right.

12:16.972 --> 12:18.394
I don't know why
I'm here seeing somebody

12:18.481 --> 12:19.629
who killed my daughter's mother.

12:19.716 --> 12:20.797
- Would you stop that?
- No.

12:20.884 --> 12:22.424
Seriously.

12:22.511 --> 12:25.568
Y'all gonna have to dead
all of this, whatever this is.

12:25.655 --> 12:27.829
I'm going back to London, y'all, I am.

12:27.916 --> 12:30.640
And Mom and Dad gonna need
both of y'all, <i>both</i> of y'all.

12:30.727 --> 12:32.867
- No, I'm good.
- Oh, really?

12:32.954 --> 12:35.311
You running like-like hip-hop
G.I. Joe, but you good.

12:35.398 --> 12:37.505
You know homeboy
likes to tote a gun now.

12:37.592 --> 12:39.282
I'm sorry,
let me-let me rephrase that.

12:39.369 --> 12:40.675
Lots... lots of guns.

12:40.762 --> 12:42.251
Yeah, you one of them tough guys

12:42.338 --> 12:44.320
who likes to throw rocks
at the prison wall

12:44.407 --> 12:45.955
until they finally let you in.

12:46.042 --> 12:48.491
Coming from an actual convict,
that's deep.

12:48.578 --> 12:51.853
But why am I here having advice
from this goon ass?

12:51.940 --> 12:54.046
'Cause both of us
love you, Hakeem.

12:54.178 --> 12:56.062
'Cause you our little brother.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.066
'Cause you all screwed up
and you need help.

12:58.153 --> 12:59.830
You're a knucklehead, Hakeem,

12:59.917 --> 13:03.877
but you can be strong
if you set your mind to it.

13:04.342 --> 13:06.339
Look, you ain't got to do it
for me, do it for your babies.

13:06.426 --> 13:08.427
Oh, you ain't care about my baby
when you killed her mother!

13:08.514 --> 13:09.704
- Stop that right now.
- No, no, no, no.

13:09.791 --> 13:12.080
He's-he's right.
I deserve that.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.317
Like Anika deserved what she got.

13:14.404 --> 13:15.785
Are you serious?

13:15.872 --> 13:17.812
Okay.

13:18.388 --> 13:19.874
Let me get this right.

13:20.170 --> 13:23.050
My daughter got no mother
'cause my brother killed her.

13:23.137 --> 13:26.150
And while I'm in the hospital
recovering for months...

13:26.441 --> 13:28.011
you was nowhere to be found.

13:28.098 --> 13:31.080
You in London having
a good-ass time, right?

13:31.537 --> 13:32.727
Yeah.

13:32.814 --> 13:34.963
I got one more question.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.291
Why am I here?

13:56.171 --> 13:59.643
Uh, thank you so much for
setting up this meeting, Becky.

13:59.730 --> 14:02.228
Thank you for coming.
You are our family.

14:02.326 --> 14:03.572
Um...

14:03.678 --> 14:06.969
well, I know that I haven't
put out that much music

14:07.056 --> 14:08.901
since Eddie shoved me.

14:08.988 --> 14:11.369
- First things first, I'm not Eddie.
- Uh-uh.

14:11.623 --> 14:13.486
Eddie's philosophy was old-school.

14:13.573 --> 14:14.534
So old-school.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.260
Decide an artist's image
and set it in stone?

14:17.421 --> 14:19.774
Your kids, your life experience...

14:19.861 --> 14:22.556
those things differentiate you
in an overcrowded market.

14:22.643 --> 14:23.645
Absolutely.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.527
Why hide what you
should be celebrating?

14:25.614 --> 14:27.371
- Let's celebrate you.
- Right?

14:27.458 --> 14:28.631
Right?

14:28.768 --> 14:30.720
Celebrate how?

14:30.904 --> 14:32.372
Who watches Bella and little Prince

14:32.459 --> 14:34.509
- when you're in the studio?
- You know my kids' names?

14:34.596 --> 14:36.642
- Duh.
- Of course I do.

14:37.787 --> 14:38.893
Don't worry,

14:38.980 --> 14:41.520
I'll direct HR
to set up on-site day care.

14:41.639 --> 14:44.345
In fact, let's get you
in the studio right away.

14:44.432 --> 14:45.853
Absolutely.

14:45.940 --> 14:47.135
Thank you.

14:47.412 --> 14:49.365
Show me who you really are.

14:49.452 --> 14:51.624
I believe the music
will flow from there.

15:09.725 --> 15:11.747
So, uh, brother Lucious,

15:11.834 --> 15:13.449
about that record you want us to play.

15:13.536 --> 15:15.571
All due respect, we can't do it.

15:15.658 --> 15:18.197
We have a curated set list.

15:22.023 --> 15:23.204
Okay.

15:23.291 --> 15:25.721
You play my record,

15:25.808 --> 15:29.043
and I'll give you an on-air

15:29.130 --> 15:31.045
exclusive interview

15:31.132 --> 15:34.653
as to the meaning behind
"A Child is Born."

15:34.740 --> 15:37.810
The "A Child is Born" song?
You never talked about that.

15:37.897 --> 15:39.895
Nor will I ever talk about it again.

15:39.982 --> 15:42.247
But you got to play my record.

15:44.428 --> 15:45.913
You first.

15:46.623 --> 15:48.663
So, um...

15:48.750 --> 15:50.994
the doctor, he walked out,

15:51.087 --> 15:54.246
and I'm left standing there,

15:54.333 --> 15:55.892
watching, uh,

15:56.024 --> 15:59.181
Cookie sleep on the hospital bed.

15:59.748 --> 16:02.084
And then all these thoughts
kept coming through my head

16:02.171 --> 16:03.483
about what if

16:03.646 --> 16:05.283
I had gotten her to the hospital

16:05.370 --> 16:08.877
in time and our baby girl
had lived, um...

16:09.638 --> 16:11.423
What if my oldest child,

16:11.510 --> 16:13.252
my firstborn,

16:13.394 --> 16:15.900
was that baby girl?

16:16.216 --> 16:18.168
You know, what if she didn't breathe

16:18.255 --> 16:21.453
her first and last breath on that day?

16:23.037 --> 16:25.366
What if I could turn back the time

16:25.453 --> 16:29.113
and see my girl being born?

16:29.528 --> 16:30.708
Hmm.

16:30.895 --> 16:33.221
I remember thinking at the time

16:33.308 --> 16:35.109
that if Cookie and I

16:35.196 --> 16:37.970
could make it through
something like that,

16:38.262 --> 16:41.102
then we could, um...

16:41.469 --> 16:44.485
we can get through anything, you know?

16:45.450 --> 16:48.781
So, our word is bond, Lucious.

16:49.303 --> 16:51.233
Tell us about your new artist.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.886
Well, I could tell you
about a treasure,

16:53.973 --> 16:56.594
but it's so much better
to see it for yourself.

16:58.059 --> 16:59.801
A'ight, so, without

16:59.888 --> 17:02.425
further ado, the Culture Freedom show

17:02.512 --> 17:04.510
brings you the world premiere

17:04.597 --> 17:07.734

17:32.991 --> 17:34.461
- Reservation under Lyon.
- Mm-hmm.

17:34.548 --> 17:36.456
Uh, Treasure's song is already

17:36.543 --> 17:39.017
the most-requested song
at the radio station.

17:39.104 --> 17:42.408
She will be out of those
social worker digs in no time.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.990
Yeah, Sway's been blowing
up my phone all day

17:45.077 --> 17:48.752
begging to be part of her
next exclusive, apologizing...

17:48.839 --> 17:50.524
Hey, dude, why am I
still standing here?

17:50.611 --> 17:52.690
I-I'm so sorry for the delay, sir.
Mrs. Barker

17:52.777 --> 17:54.155
changed the reservation to her name.

17:54.242 --> 17:57.141
- Mrs. Barker?
- Uh-huh.

17:59.456 --> 18:01.421
Oh, hell no.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.323
Cooks.

18:06.410 --> 18:09.070
Lucious, hi, I'm so glad
you could make it.

18:09.238 --> 18:11.664
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, don't blame Treasure.

18:11.751 --> 18:13.642
I made an offer she couldn't refuse

18:13.729 --> 18:15.759
and she's an Empire artist now.

18:15.846 --> 18:19.546
You thieving bitch.
And you fell for this, Treasure?

18:19.716 --> 18:22.149
All money is not good money, okay?

18:22.236 --> 18:24.162
You are worth more than some advance

18:24.249 --> 18:26.179
this snake could offer you.

18:26.293 --> 18:28.926
All they are going to do is pair you

18:29.013 --> 18:31.743
with half-assed producers
with no beats

18:31.830 --> 18:33.625
who don't know who you are.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.580
Look, guys,
I'm not signing with Empire

18:35.667 --> 18:37.390
because of the sales pitch.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.339
You told me yourself, Cookie,

18:39.426 --> 18:41.225
you said, "Don't be afraid
of real success."

18:41.312 --> 18:43.591
And, look, I'm sorry.

18:43.740 --> 18:46.345
Making music in your living room
was really cute,

18:46.432 --> 18:49.249
but Empire just has
the resources to make me a star.

18:49.336 --> 18:52.744
That company is being run
by a tech dude

18:52.831 --> 18:55.242
who knows nothing about music,

18:55.336 --> 18:57.831
and neither does this dried-up bird.

18:57.918 --> 19:00.081
Don't forget,
we're the ones that built

19:00.168 --> 19:01.608
Empire from the ground up.

19:01.695 --> 19:03.550
We know how to make stars,

19:03.637 --> 19:06.065
and we also know how
to tear 'em out of the sky.

19:06.152 --> 19:08.431
Remember that little contract
you signed with us?

19:08.518 --> 19:10.188
We're gonna sue your ass.

19:10.275 --> 19:12.515
If you do that I'm gonna
pull you into years of litigation,

19:12.602 --> 19:15.189
legal fees... both of which
we know you don't have the time

19:15.276 --> 19:18.531
or the resources to handle.
Do you really want to do that?

19:19.285 --> 19:20.821
Look, I will write you

19:20.908 --> 19:23.249
- a check for all...
- Keep your check, bitch.

19:27.382 --> 19:29.015

20:30.780 --> 20:32.452
Sounding good, babe.

20:41.831 --> 20:44.171
Kai, my family needs me.

20:44.347 --> 20:45.484
They do, I know.

20:45.571 --> 20:47.262
I know.

20:47.952 --> 20:49.774
I just... I need to stay in New York

20:49.861 --> 20:51.546
for a few months.

20:52.004 --> 20:53.946
- Months.
- Yeah, but listen.

20:54.033 --> 20:56.452
You know, I would, I would expect...

20:56.684 --> 20:59.163
or I would hope...

20:59.443 --> 21:02.564
you know, that you'd
stay here with me.

21:02.651 --> 21:05.697
I thought we both had a-a life
and careers in London?

21:05.784 --> 21:07.343
We do, we do.

21:08.818 --> 21:11.239
London's home, you know?

21:11.547 --> 21:13.276
I'm not trying
to mess with that.

21:13.363 --> 21:14.839
I don't want you to, either.

21:14.926 --> 21:16.884
So while you're helping
your family here,

21:16.988 --> 21:18.236
what do you propose I do?

21:18.323 --> 21:20.557
Babe, what do you always do? Work.

21:20.644 --> 21:22.807
Come on, you got, like,
a million and one

21:22.894 --> 21:24.843
journalist friends here in New York.

21:24.930 --> 21:27.421
Invite them to brunch or drinks.

21:27.577 --> 21:29.116
You know, just...

21:32.029 --> 21:34.429
A few months?

21:34.979 --> 21:37.147
That means three.

21:37.234 --> 21:38.780
- Not four.
- Not four.

21:38.867 --> 21:40.770
- Maybe two.
- Three.

21:40.857 --> 21:42.952
- All right.
- Thank you.

21:44.227 --> 21:48.252
<i>Laboratory edition,
signature series torque wrench,</i>

21:48.339 --> 21:51.515
the kind used by Caltech
high-energy physicists

21:51.602 --> 21:53.570
and NASA engineers.

21:53.770 --> 21:55.892
Well, in that case,

21:55.979 --> 21:58.385
how could you be sure
that's accurate?

21:59.269 --> 22:01.071
Because a split-second before...

22:01.158 --> 22:03.673
What did I say about popping
off without permission?

22:03.760 --> 22:05.229
- Hmm?!
- Yo, Gusto. Gusto.

22:05.316 --> 22:07.619
- Mind your damn business.
- Okay, let's talk business then.

22:07.706 --> 22:10.835
Okay? Leave Quincy alone and-and

22:10.926 --> 22:13.048
when I'm out of here,
you got everything in my locker.

22:13.135 --> 22:14.172
Everything?

22:14.259 --> 22:16.015
Even my burner phone.

22:17.795 --> 22:20.382
Okay. Okay.

22:20.754 --> 22:22.641
Here's my counteroffer.

22:22.894 --> 22:25.248
I take everything
in your locker,

22:25.335 --> 22:26.616
including your phone.

22:26.703 --> 22:29.640
I take princess here
until I'm done with him

22:29.727 --> 22:31.179
and I do it while you still in here.

22:31.266 --> 22:32.717
That work for you? Huh?

22:32.804 --> 22:35.952
Hey, no. Hey, move.

22:36.894 --> 22:39.140
- Now.
- Let's go.

22:39.652 --> 22:41.335
Keep it moving.

22:42.745 --> 22:45.171
<i>Dead-on balls accurate?</i>

22:46.170 --> 22:47.891
<i>Somebody's</i>

22:47.978 --> 22:48.999
- listening to my calls.
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.

22:49.086 --> 22:50.800
I have to tell Juanita
about running up

22:50.887 --> 22:53.296
this damn electricity bill.

22:54.613 --> 22:57.362
I wanted to slap the yellow

22:57.449 --> 22:59.585
off of Giselle's ass.

23:00.340 --> 23:01.878
Knock them green eyes

23:01.965 --> 23:03.728
right to the back of her head.

23:03.815 --> 23:05.940
You probably would've,

23:06.027 --> 23:07.197
if your feet wasn't killing you.

23:07.284 --> 23:08.820
Give them to me.

23:09.308 --> 23:10.641
So now what, Cook?

23:10.728 --> 23:13.984
It's just you and me, kid.
Back to square one.

23:18.521 --> 23:20.066
Baby.

23:21.621 --> 23:22.894
It's my old office.

23:22.981 --> 23:24.480
Answer it.

23:28.345 --> 23:30.218
Yeah, who this?

23:30.879 --> 23:32.462
It's Kingsley.

23:32.549 --> 23:34.656
- What?
- Kingsley. He wants to meet.

23:36.090 --> 23:38.343
Hey, well, hold on.
Slow down, man.

23:38.475 --> 23:39.937
First, why?

23:47.699 --> 23:49.121
Cookie.

23:49.208 --> 23:50.957
Lucious.

23:52.126 --> 23:53.984
So glad you came.

23:55.144 --> 23:56.845
Took the liberty of ordering for you.

23:56.932 --> 23:59.113
Well, you left out the watermelon.

24:03.238 --> 24:05.370
Probably wondering why
I asked you to meet me here.

24:05.457 --> 24:07.093
It better not be to gloat

24:07.180 --> 24:10.437
because Empire stole Treasure
from up under our noses, Jeff.

24:10.524 --> 24:12.904
My apologies.
Giselle acted unilaterally.

24:12.991 --> 24:15.072
And please, call me Kingsley.

24:15.159 --> 24:17.117
- My friends do.
- I'm not your friend.

24:17.204 --> 24:18.529
Why should we believe you, Jeff?

24:18.616 --> 24:21.436
Because I respect you both,
which is why we're here,

24:21.618 --> 24:24.822
a place that's symbolic
of my plans for Empire.

24:24.909 --> 24:26.624
Hey, you know,
based on your background...

24:26.711 --> 24:30.541
I mean, a Boy Scout, prep schools,

24:30.628 --> 24:33.461
sold your first app while
you were still at Stanford.

24:33.548 --> 24:36.788
And then you became
Kelly Patel's Littlefinger.

24:36.933 --> 24:39.196
Nothing in that resume suggests

24:39.283 --> 24:42.474
that you have a hint
of what it takes to make plans

24:42.561 --> 24:44.406
for my Empire.

24:45.433 --> 24:47.924
I want to take Empire
back to its roots.

24:48.011 --> 24:50.369
- Oh.
- Eddie Barker... rest in peace...

24:50.456 --> 24:51.967
he messed up when he cut you out.

24:52.054 --> 24:54.760
Look, as long as
an outsider has the keys,

24:54.847 --> 24:57.147
hell could freeze over.
We ain't never coming back.

24:57.234 --> 25:00.167
Home. That's what it is, your home.

25:00.526 --> 25:02.031
You built the place.

25:02.118 --> 25:04.496
A couple of hard-knock kids
from North Philly

25:04.583 --> 25:07.530
start a little label
and conquer the music business?

25:08.214 --> 25:10.384
But that's not what's
most important to you.

25:10.472 --> 25:14.303
And you think you know
what's important to us.

25:15.419 --> 25:16.666
Family.

25:17.909 --> 25:22.045
Every family
needs a matriarch and a patriarch.

25:23.245 --> 25:24.341
I'm offering you

25:24.428 --> 25:25.850
chairman and chairwoman emeritus.

25:25.937 --> 25:27.564
What do you mean,
a figurehead?

25:27.651 --> 25:28.753
- Oh.
- I'll cut you a check

25:28.840 --> 25:30.433
to come to a few key events,

25:30.520 --> 25:32.117
shake a few shareholder hands.

25:32.204 --> 25:35.039
Best of all, your face back
on the Empire logo, Lucious,

25:35.126 --> 25:37.014
where it belongs.

25:38.448 --> 25:39.737
Cookie...

25:40.031 --> 25:41.378
Lucious...

25:41.925 --> 25:43.951
please come home.

25:56.438 --> 25:59.096
I swear I take a drink
every single time

25:59.183 --> 26:00.892
Bryson has to remind me
that he's Kai's ex.

26:00.979 --> 26:02.828
Okay, well, we'll get you
a second glass.

26:02.915 --> 26:05.222
Just remember you're here
to get your man a job

26:05.309 --> 26:07.399
in New York City so we can
keep having brunch like this.

26:07.486 --> 26:09.486
- You're right.
- Also, didn't you say

26:09.573 --> 26:11.079
that you was gonna let me listen
to some new music?

26:11.166 --> 26:12.760
'Cause I feel like you said that.

26:12.847 --> 26:14.573
- I ain't never said that. No Empire talk.
- You said...

26:14.660 --> 26:15.861
- Leave me alone.
- You've changed

26:15.948 --> 26:17.016
since you
came back from London.

26:17.103 --> 26:18.934
It's not like you've taken
any real assignments

26:19.021 --> 26:21.672
- since Jamal domesticated you.
- Oh, man.

26:21.759 --> 26:23.663
Okay, there you go.
That's not true. Right, babe?

26:23.750 --> 26:25.520
My new life with you is my choice.

26:25.673 --> 26:26.824
I'm happy.

26:26.962 --> 26:28.156
Yeah, but it's a pity, though.

26:28.243 --> 26:29.918
There's a new assignment
out of the New York Bureau.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.981
Some child trafficking in Mogadishu.

26:32.212 --> 26:33.233
Babe, that's amazing.

26:33.320 --> 26:35.976
That's a chance to get to do
some great work with kids

26:36.063 --> 26:38.230
- in third world countries.
- "Third world" is a...

26:38.317 --> 26:39.423
colonialist term.

26:39.510 --> 26:41.336
- A colonizer would know.
- Yeah, man,

26:41.423 --> 26:42.652
is there an issue that we're not...

26:42.739 --> 26:44.294
I-I think he means cut the crap

26:44.381 --> 26:46.209
and don't speak to my man
like that again.

26:46.296 --> 26:47.617
- Yeah, come on.
- Sorry.

26:47.704 --> 26:49.389
- Thank you.
- Maybe I was being a little extra.

26:49.476 --> 26:50.883
I'll stand down.

26:50.970 --> 26:52.231
But I know you, Kai.

26:52.318 --> 26:53.568
You're tempted.

26:54.610 --> 26:56.504
I suppose it depends
on who's shooting.

26:56.591 --> 26:57.998
Me.

26:59.087 --> 27:01.254
Just like old times.

27:21.862 --> 27:22.910
You sure?

27:22.997 --> 27:25.584
Are you gonna help me out or not?

27:26.549 --> 27:28.177
I got you, Dre.

27:30.275 --> 27:34.182
And then I'm looking like,
how come when... I said

27:34.269 --> 27:36.161
about staying in New York,
you had to think about it...

27:36.248 --> 27:38.987
which I understand...
but then, the second that old

27:39.074 --> 27:41.888
what's-his-bitch-ass Bryson
mentions a job or whatever,

27:41.975 --> 27:42.982
then all of a sudden you're intrigued.

27:43.069 --> 27:43.990
Wait, what are you trying to say?

27:44.077 --> 27:45.595
I'm saying I want to make
sure that you're intrigued

27:45.682 --> 27:47.708
with staying in New York with
me and not with his ass.

27:47.795 --> 27:50.291
Wait, wait, hang on.
Are you kidding right now?

27:50.378 --> 27:51.841
Let's remember, Jamal,
this whole scenario

27:51.928 --> 27:53.615
was your idea, not mine.

27:54.571 --> 27:56.017
I know your history.

27:56.104 --> 27:58.881
You've been hurt many times
and I'm sorry about that.

27:58.985 --> 28:01.974
But do not let your past
leak into our present, my man.

28:02.434 --> 28:04.295
Either you trust me or you don't.

28:08.474 --> 28:10.068
<i>Sir. Sir, you're not
gonna be able to come in.</i>

28:10.155 --> 28:11.810
Yo, my parents birthed
this place, man!

28:11.897 --> 28:13.595
- Sir...
- Y'all gonna let me in.

28:14.033 --> 28:15.943
Up out of here, man. What's up?

28:16.030 --> 28:17.752
- Hakeem.
- Peanut head.

28:17.839 --> 28:19.622
Hey, babe, tell these
rent-a-cops to let me upstairs.

28:19.709 --> 28:20.437
Gun!

28:20.524 --> 28:22.450
Oh, my...
What's going on? Stop!

28:22.537 --> 28:25.013
- Get off me, little man!
- Let him go!

28:27.681 --> 28:29.388
What y'all looking at?

28:30.298 --> 28:31.464
Are you drunk?

28:31.564 --> 28:33.564
Come on, you with the preaching, too?

28:33.651 --> 28:36.672
I miss you.
I'm here to see my kids!

28:36.759 --> 28:38.559
- You're not gonna see your kids.
- Yeah, where my kids at?!

28:38.646 --> 28:39.615
Touch me one more time

28:39.702 --> 28:40.569
- and I'll have them
- All right, little girl.

28:40.656 --> 28:41.874
- Carry your drunk ass up out of here.
- Okay.

28:41.961 --> 28:43.330
Go, now.

28:43.986 --> 28:46.606
- All right, little girl.
- Leave.

28:49.518 --> 28:51.833

29:13.413 --> 29:15.727
as Sid, Lord of the Flame.

Yo, why you got so much
to say to me lately?

29:17.998 --> 29:19.515
You scared you gonna miss me?

29:28.310 --> 29:32.255
Down! Back up! Back up!
Against the wall!

29:35.523 --> 29:37.324
Let's go.

29:52.815 --> 29:55.161
Keem, Tiana called us.

29:56.890 --> 29:58.396
Boy, let us help you.

29:58.483 --> 30:00.137
- I'm a'ight.
- No, you're not all right,

30:00.224 --> 30:03.771
walking around toting guns and
drinking like they paying you.

30:03.858 --> 30:04.959
Ain't nobody trying to
hear

30:05.046 --> 30:06.458
- your lecture, man.
- Boy, I will take this bottle

30:06.545 --> 30:08.568
- and bust you...
- Honey, honey, baby, baby.

30:10.372 --> 30:12.445
Listen, man.

30:14.440 --> 30:16.460
I see you, Hakeem.

30:16.621 --> 30:19.221
I know you think that I don't,

30:19.467 --> 30:21.370
but I see you.

30:21.524 --> 30:24.409
And I know exactly what this is about.

30:24.676 --> 30:27.213
- You're afraid right now.
- I ain't scared.

30:27.300 --> 30:29.463
You are.
You're afraid that you're not

30:29.550 --> 30:31.612
gonna be as good
as you were before.

30:32.405 --> 30:35.873
You think I wasn't scared
every album that I made?

30:35.960 --> 30:39.237
Afraid that it wasn't gonna
be as good as the last album?

30:39.468 --> 30:41.839
Afraid that everybody
was gonna think that,

30:41.926 --> 30:44.863
"Hey, Lucious is some washed-up rapper

30:44.950 --> 30:48.624
that had his little 15 minutes
of fame and now it's gone."

30:50.846 --> 30:53.620
You think me and your mama
don't know about loss,

30:53.843 --> 30:55.257
heartache,

30:55.407 --> 30:58.104
disappointment and pain?

30:59.193 --> 31:01.664
Music is all I know.

31:03.116 --> 31:04.558
Come home.

31:05.101 --> 31:06.369
Okay?

31:06.456 --> 31:07.592

31:07.679 --> 31:09.677
We'll work it all out.

31:11.592 --> 31:14.174

31:16.992 --> 31:19.229
All right, I'm-a grab my stuff.

31:19.753 --> 31:22.001
Okay.

31:31.310 --> 31:33.690
Our family needs us.

31:34.918 --> 31:37.257
We gon' take that Kingsley deal.

31:48.018 --> 31:50.475
- Hey, Miss Juanita.
- Hello. How you doing, sweetie pie?

31:50.562 --> 31:51.476
I'm good. How you doing?

31:51.563 --> 31:52.986
- Ugh.
- See it didn't take much

31:53.073 --> 31:54.770
for your raggedy ass to settle in.

31:54.857 --> 31:56.413
I see it didn't take
for you to come here

31:56.500 --> 31:58.093
- and get some free breakfast.
- Uh...

31:58.180 --> 32:00.183
your mother and your father
invited me, stupid.

32:00.270 --> 32:01.329
Thank you.

32:01.416 --> 32:02.983
You're welcome.

32:03.199 --> 32:05.026
Look, in other news,

32:05.819 --> 32:07.487
I'm-a stay a little while.

32:07.577 --> 32:09.114
Might give me a chance to, you know,

32:09.201 --> 32:11.161
get you back on track
with your music.

32:11.248 --> 32:12.195
If you down.

32:12.282 --> 32:14.147
Let me think about it.

32:15.277 --> 32:16.854
Think about it.

32:17.935 --> 32:19.202
Ma!

32:19.421 --> 32:20.967
It's good to see

32:21.054 --> 32:23.049
my boys laughing
and you snitching.

32:23.136 --> 32:25.557
- That mean you feeling better.
- Mm-hmm.

32:27.253 --> 32:28.709
Listen, y'all,

32:28.796 --> 32:31.635
um, your mother and I
have made a decision.

32:31.784 --> 32:34.776
We decided we're gonna
go back to Empire.

32:35.194 --> 32:36.430
Y'all, why?

32:36.580 --> 32:37.730
- It don't make no sense.
- Okay,

32:37.817 --> 32:39.554
- look, look, look, boys.
- You already know what I think.

32:39.641 --> 32:42.963
This is the best choice
for this family, okay?

32:43.467 --> 32:47.035
Yeah, now, they're throwing
a little "welcome home"

32:47.122 --> 32:50.119
get-together in the lobby
of Empire later on tonight.

32:50.206 --> 32:51.699
- Thank you, Juanita.
- Thank you.

32:51.786 --> 32:53.166
Me and your mother
thought it would be good

32:53.253 --> 32:55.533
if we go down there
as a family and just

32:55.620 --> 32:57.862
- do it together, as a family.
- Yes.

32:58.257 --> 33:00.295
- Okay?
- Oh, we got choices now?

33:00.382 --> 33:01.996
- No, you do not.
- We don't never get no choice.

33:02.083 --> 33:05.215
- No, you do not.
- Okay. So it's... Okay.

33:05.377 --> 33:06.900
- Good.
- I guess it is.

34:37.469 --> 34:38.638
it's strange, it...

34:38.725 --> 34:40.793
Just, something
feels different around here.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.326
You've outgrown it.

You and Cookie can focus on your boys

- Of course.

34:48.650 --> 34:50.547
You and me both know these artists...

34:50.634 --> 34:51.871
these so-called artists...

34:51.958 --> 34:53.777
don't understand
that their true purpose

34:53.864 --> 34:56.290
is to contribute to our bottom line.

34:56.677 --> 34:57.739
They're spoiled.

34:57.826 --> 34:59.565
You're done with all that.

35:01.529 --> 35:03.321
You know,
when I created this place,

35:03.408 --> 35:05.407
I did it because...

35:05.596 --> 35:08.417
I loved the music, and-and...

35:08.563 --> 35:10.747
- I loved those babies.
- Yeah?

35:10.834 --> 35:13.305
They are the bottom line
of this place.

35:13.392 --> 35:15.455
They're the purpose behind it.

35:15.542 --> 35:16.946
Now, if you don't understand that,

35:17.033 --> 35:19.873
how in the world can you and me
be working together?

35:21.675 --> 35:23.293
All these people and press are here

35:23.380 --> 35:25.655
so that we can announce your return.

35:28.049 --> 35:30.647
Okay, here's what's gonna happen.

40:13.873 --> 40:15.307
No, honestly.

40:15.562 --> 40:16.966
I said do you trust me, baby?

40:17.053 --> 40:18.342
- What's this about?
- Do you trust me?

40:18.429 --> 40:19.825
- Yes. Yes.
- Okay.

40:19.912 --> 40:21.560
Y'all trust me?

40:21.647 --> 40:23.169
All right, I'm gonna ask everybody,

40:23.256 --> 40:25.084
let-let's sit down and get comfortable

40:25.171 --> 40:26.442
and have a family conversation,

40:26.529 --> 40:27.901
if that's okay.

40:28.234 --> 40:31.504
Please. Baby, sit down.

40:33.577 --> 40:35.622
Thank you so much.

40:36.156 --> 40:38.522
Now, I know that you guys

40:38.609 --> 40:40.430
have heard rumors that

40:40.517 --> 40:42.396
the Lyons are broke.

40:42.483 --> 40:44.972
Well, I'm here to tell you

40:45.059 --> 40:46.866
that those aren't rumors.

40:46.953 --> 40:48.803
It's the gospel truth.

40:49.617 --> 40:51.782
We are broke as hell.

40:51.880 --> 40:54.044
We spent every penny we had

40:54.131 --> 40:56.860
fighting to get Empire back.

40:57.622 --> 40:58.996
But that's over.

40:59.091 --> 41:01.722
Like the Bible said,
there's a time to seek,

41:01.809 --> 41:03.961
and there's a time to give up as lost.

41:04.216 --> 41:07.362
So we have to think about
moving into the future.

41:07.449 --> 41:10.877
And, unfortunately,
this place ain't it.

41:11.108 --> 41:12.652
What?

41:13.067 --> 41:16.544
You see, record labels like this one

41:16.631 --> 41:18.612
are nothing but dinosaurs.

41:18.699 --> 41:21.783
And Jeff Kingsley is nothing
but a number cruncher

41:21.870 --> 41:24.400
who have no respect for the musicians

41:24.487 --> 41:26.788
or the music that they produce.

41:26.922 --> 41:29.179
What did you call them?
Um, you called them

41:29.266 --> 41:30.859
spoiled babies.

41:31.136 --> 41:32.565
All he wants to do

41:32.652 --> 41:34.584
is take you for whatever he can

41:34.671 --> 41:36.932
for as long as he can.

41:37.019 --> 41:40.557
But I know that the real power
lies in the artist,

41:40.644 --> 41:43.894
because you have
the ability to create.

41:43.981 --> 41:48.968
So I'm going to offer you...
anyone signed at Empire

41:49.089 --> 41:51.448
who don't want some tech nerd

41:51.535 --> 41:53.182
dancing in their video,

41:53.269 --> 41:56.236
who wants to know
their real value in this market

41:56.323 --> 41:57.986
and their real power...

41:58.073 --> 42:00.736
I'm gonna ask you to come
and step up with us,

42:00.823 --> 42:01.792
the Lyons,

42:01.879 --> 42:03.761
and let us walk you into the future

42:03.848 --> 42:07.936
with our brand-new management
company and production company,

42:08.023 --> 42:09.900
where we're going to put you first

42:09.987 --> 42:12.069
and you first and you first,

42:12.156 --> 42:15.955
and your music first.
We're out of here.

42:16.042 --> 42:17.711
Come on, baby.

42:17.798 --> 42:18.816
We good?

42:18.903 --> 42:21.085
We're better than good.

42:21.172 --> 42:22.700
Amen.

42:24.980 --> 42:27.102
You're making a mistake, Lucious.

42:27.389 --> 42:29.422
But it feels so right.

42:47.959 --> 42:51.056
Um... the limo's out front.

42:51.360 --> 42:52.896
Who you want to ride with?

42:52.983 --> 42:54.164
I'm riding alone, man.

42:54.251 --> 42:55.591
Okay.

42:56.319 --> 42:57.568
Are you kidding me?

42:57.655 --> 42:59.230
This is a funeral.
The man's grieving.

42:59.317 --> 43:00.411
We understand that,

43:00.498 --> 43:01.854
but we need to talk to him.

43:01.991 --> 43:03.606
Now.
