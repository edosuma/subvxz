00:36.954 --> 00:38.873
<i>This is a story about two men,</i>

00:38.956 --> 00:42.043
<i>one named Gale Sayers,
the other Brian Piccolo.</i>

00:42.126 --> 00:44.211
<i>They came from different parts
of the country.</i>

00:44.295 --> 00:46.213
<i>They competed for the same job.</i>

00:46.297 --> 00:48.883
<i>One was white, the other black.</i>

00:48.966 --> 00:50.384
<i>One liked to talk a lot.</i>

00:50.468 --> 00:52.386
<i>The other was shy as a 3-year-old.</i>

00:52.470 --> 00:55.473
<i>Our story is about how they
came to know each other...</i>

00:55.556 --> 00:56.932
<i>fight each other...</i>

00:57.016 --> 00:59.894
<i>and help each other.</i>

01:00.478 --> 01:04.272
<i>Ernest Hemingway said that
every true story ends in death.</i>

01:04.355 --> 01:06.192
<i>Well, this is a true story.</i>

01:06.275 --> 01:07.818
Yo! heads up!

01:12.239 --> 01:14.533
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

01:20.831 --> 01:21.707
Gale Sayers?

01:23.751 --> 01:24.585
Yeah.

01:24.668 --> 01:27.171
Hey. Brian Piccolo. We met up in Buffalo

01:27.254 --> 01:29.465
in that all-American game last June.

01:30.800 --> 01:34.220
Sorry I didn't remember.
I'm not very good at that kind of stuff.

01:34.804 --> 01:37.640
Oh, golly. Hey, that's all right.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.851
I can see how you might forget,
but, well, I sure couldn't.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.853
That was a heck of a talk we had, man.

01:42.937 --> 01:45.106
I said, uh, "I'm Brian Piccolo.

01:45.189 --> 01:47.483
I hear we'll both be playing
for the Bears."

01:47.566 --> 01:49.610
and you said--
Well, I'll never forget it.

01:49.693 --> 01:52.905
You said, "Uh-huh."
Just like that. "Uh-huh."

01:53.864 --> 01:56.867
Whenever I'm feeling kind of low
and depressed, well,

01:56.951 --> 01:58.828
I think about that advice.

01:58.911 --> 02:01.789
A lot of guys wouldn't have talked to me at all,
but not you.

02:01.872 --> 02:04.458
You just said, "Uh-huh."
Just like that. Right out.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.128
Uh-huh.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.382
Where do I go to check in?

02:11.966 --> 02:14.635
Oh, that building over there.
That's where Halas is.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.639
Uh-huh.

02:24.562 --> 02:26.021
Hey.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.274
Did you ever meet him before?

02:29.066 --> 02:32.027
Talked to him on the phone a couple of times.
That's all.

02:32.111 --> 02:33.863
Yeah. Well--

02:34.530 --> 02:37.324
Look, let me give you
a little hint, all right?

02:37.408 --> 02:40.828
See, he's, uh--
I mean, he's a good guy and all that,

02:40.911 --> 02:43.414
but he's a little deaf in his left ear.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.333
And a little too vain to admit it.
You understand?

02:46.417 --> 02:51.046
So you gotta stand on his right-hand side
if you want him to hear a word you say.

02:51.547 --> 02:54.300
Uh-huh. Okay. Thanks.

02:54.383 --> 02:57.052
You bet. Hey, rookies gotta stick together.

03:30.836 --> 03:34.465
Pardon me. Can you tell me the way
to Halas's office?

03:34.548 --> 03:35.841
Thank you.

03:50.272 --> 03:51.607
Come in.

03:54.944 --> 03:56.737
Well, Sayers.

03:58.239 --> 04:00.491
- I'm George Halas.
- Yeah, I know.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.493
Everybody knows who you are.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.246
You're just in time to give me
a hand with this thing.

04:05.329 --> 04:07.248
My good luck picture.

04:07.331 --> 04:10.292
That's the first professional team
I ever played on.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.878
Decatur Staleys in 1920.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.632
How's your leg?

04:17.132 --> 04:19.093
I understand we--

04:21.595 --> 04:22.763
I understand you hurt it.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.975
- It's fine. One hundred percent.
- And your head?

04:26.058 --> 04:29.395
My head?
Uh, nothing wrong with my head.

04:29.478 --> 04:34.066
Good. Because being in that all-star game
put you three weeks behind everybody else.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.484
Ain't gonna be easy.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.236
NFL ain't supposed to be easy.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.822
That's right.

04:41.115 --> 04:43.409
All I can promise you is a fair shot.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.704
But you're gonna have
a lot of company.

04:46.787 --> 04:50.040
John Arnett, Ralph Kurek, Brian Piccolo.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.251
Gonna be plenty...

04:54.211 --> 04:57.214
- Gonna be plenty crowded out there.
- Well...

04:57.298 --> 05:00.009
Fair shot is all I want.
Can't ask more than that.

05:00.092 --> 05:04.305
Well, we plan using our backs
as receivers this year.

05:04.972 --> 05:09.685
Did you do much--
Did you do much pass catching when--

05:10.144 --> 05:11.687
when you were in college?

05:11.770 --> 05:14.690
Uh, well, yes, sir. I did.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.942
Uh, usually, uh, safety valve stuff.

05:17.026 --> 05:19.403
Yeah. Well, I like to keep
my backs in a pattern.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.405
That is, unless the other
team's blitzing.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.657
And that's something
you're gonna have to watch.

05:23.741 --> 05:26.910
Those linebackers.
You gotta make sure they're not coming in.

05:26.994 --> 05:30.247
- I know. Especially with--
- What the hell are you doing?

05:30.331 --> 05:31.707
I-- I don't know what you mean.

05:31.790 --> 05:35.210
Well, I know you got moves,
but you don't have to show them to me now.

05:35.294 --> 05:38.756
You're bouncing around here like a--
like a pauper in a pay toilet.

05:38.839 --> 05:42.926
Well, I was just trying to get on the side
of your, uh, good ear.

05:44.178 --> 05:47.264
Good ear? What are you talking about,
"good ear"?

05:47.973 --> 05:49.183
Uh--

05:49.933 --> 05:51.643
Uh, Brian Piccolo, uh,

05:51.727 --> 05:53.520
said that, uh...

05:54.688 --> 05:56.607
He, uh, said, uh...

05:59.109 --> 06:00.694
Uh--

06:09.953 --> 06:12.790
Hey, Sayers.
We're gonna have to stop meeting like this.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.292
My wife's starting to get suspicious. Heh.

06:21.632 --> 06:23.550
Hold it down. Hey.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.763
Some of you cats that pulled in today...

06:28.806 --> 06:31.016
haven't had a chance to hear
what's expected of you.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.102
So hold it down and let me talk.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.688
Now, you new guys are gonna get
a playbook tomorrow.

06:36.772 --> 06:38.440
It's like the Bible.

06:38.524 --> 06:41.276
Now, you lose your playbook,
it's gonna cost you $1,000.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.405
- I heard this thing twice already today.
- One, zero, zero, zero.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.365
Lose your playbook, it costs you $1,000.

06:46.448 --> 06:49.743
Second time, they cut off your right foot
and feed it to the defensive platoon.

06:49.827 --> 06:51.286
Would you cool it, please?

06:51.370 --> 06:53.580
Man, I am just trying to be helpful.

06:53.664 --> 06:56.250
- Like you helped me with Halas?
- Mr. Sayers!

07:02.506 --> 07:06.260
I was just mentioning the fine for talking
at team meetings. Did you hear what I said?

07:09.638 --> 07:11.390
No, I did not.

07:11.473 --> 07:16.812
Well, the fine for talking at team meeting is $25.
And it's just been laid on you.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.230
Can you dig that?

07:20.107 --> 07:21.316
Yeah.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.158
Sorry, man.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.128
Hey, hold up. Whoa.

07:41.211 --> 07:45.215
It's been brought to my attention
that unless Sayers was saying his beads,

07:45.299 --> 07:47.759
it might be fair if Mr. Piccolo
would sing us a song.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.803
Say like maybe a fight song.

07:50.304 --> 07:52.389
Wake Forest, right, Mr. Piccolo?

07:54.683 --> 07:56.143
Yeah. That's right.

07:59.771 --> 08:05.068
You can't let it get to you.
It's just a question of style. Style, I say.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.907
Ahem. Excuse me.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.911
♪ Oh, here's to Wake Forest ♪

08:14.912 --> 08:18.123
♪ A glass of the finest
Red ruby rhenish filled up to the brim ♪

08:19.458 --> 08:22.920
♪ Her sons, they are many

08:23.003 --> 08:25.589
♪ With hearts o'erflowing

08:26.632 --> 08:28.217

08:35.015 --> 08:37.851
♪ We'll herald the story
and die for her glory ♪♪

08:37.934 --> 08:40.187
Come on, sit down!

09:06.838 --> 09:09.007
All right. Let's go to ten, nice and loud.

09:09.091 --> 09:11.134
Start off slowly. Ready, exercise.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.638
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.600
Dig, dig, dig!
What the hell's wrong with you?

09:18.684 --> 09:21.812
You're not trying! You're not trying.
You make me sick.

09:25.524 --> 09:28.110
Those uniforms were just loaned
to you guys, you know that?

09:28.193 --> 09:31.321
We'll let you keep them
as long as you play like Chicago Bears.

09:31.405 --> 09:35.325
The minute you start tiptoeing around,
we'll want those uniforms back, gentlemen.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.785
Now, 42 trap. Sayers up.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.163
Way to go, way to go, Gale!

09:41.999 --> 09:45.711
That's more like it.
Good execution, Charlie. That's it.

09:47.087 --> 09:51.425
Two, ninety-two.
Two, ninety-two. Set. Hup!

09:53.677 --> 09:55.220
All right. All right!

09:58.140 --> 10:00.309
Ready, set, go.

10:01.184 --> 10:02.519
Ready, set.

10:10.319 --> 10:11.987
Ready, set, go.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.786
Go, go, go!

10:22.789 --> 10:23.832
Man.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.336
I think it's working.

10:27.753 --> 10:28.879
What's working?

10:30.213 --> 10:31.882
I'm getting you overconfident.

10:36.053 --> 10:39.222
Ready, hup, hup. Hup!

10:39.306 --> 10:42.809
Plant. You gotta plant your right foot, boy.
That's dumb.

10:48.523 --> 10:50.442
Yeah, uh...

10:51.360 --> 10:53.445
Just practicing the halfback option.

10:58.075 --> 11:01.578
Well, see, I haven't got the lock
that you have on making the team,

11:01.662 --> 11:04.956
and Halas said that they're gonna use
that option a lot this year.

11:05.040 --> 11:08.752
And, uh, it's not one of my strong points.
Understand?

11:10.128 --> 11:11.922
Try going to your left.

11:13.048 --> 11:15.717
They don't look for a right-handed guy
to throw going to his left.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.012
Okay. I will. Thank you.

11:21.306 --> 11:24.434
Hey, Sayers. I did say thank you.

11:26.103 --> 11:27.312
I know.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.607
Well, that usually calls for a response.
Like, uh:

11:31.233 --> 11:33.443
"You're welcome," or "How's your mother?"
Something.

11:34.403 --> 11:35.445
"How's your mother?"

11:35.529 --> 11:37.781
Well, she's very fine.
Thank you for asking.

11:39.825 --> 11:41.076
You're welcome.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.219
<i>Hup, hup!</i>

12:01.388 --> 12:05.350
<i>- Okay, first cut. Where do we start?
- Backfield.</i>

12:05.434 --> 12:08.311
<i>- Brenner. Daniels.
- Cut. Cut.</i>

12:08.729 --> 12:11.565
<i>- Sayers?
- Heh, heh, are you kidding?</i>

12:11.648 --> 12:15.318
<i>- Charles?
- Shoot him. Justifiable homicide.</i>

12:15.402 --> 12:19.197
<i>- What about Piccolo?
- He's too slow, and he's too light.</i>

12:19.281 --> 12:21.825
<i>But I don't know, Ed.
He hangs in there like a terrier.</i>

12:21.908 --> 12:24.828
<i>- Let's keep him till the final cut.
- Okay.</i>

12:24.911 --> 12:26.788
Hup, hup!

12:26.872 --> 12:28.039
Hup!

12:36.548 --> 12:40.260
Piccolo, you bone-headed spaghetti eater!
That was fake draw, screen right.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.637
What the hell do you do
on fake draw, screen right?

12:42.721 --> 12:45.515
Well, on a fake draw, screen right,

12:45.599 --> 12:47.726
I pick up the linebacker, if he's coming.

12:47.809 --> 12:51.313
Unless it's Butkus, then I simply notify
the quarterback to send for a priest.

12:52.314 --> 12:53.607
All right. Knock it off.

12:53.690 --> 12:56.985
Don't encourage him.
Let's run that again. Come on.

12:58.069 --> 13:01.031
- We're not holding this man up.
- I know we're not.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.240
That's why we're here.

13:02.324 --> 13:04.785
Don't tell me about the fool,
because I was there!

13:05.243 --> 13:07.621
- You talk like-- Come in.
- The problem is...

13:07.704 --> 13:09.080
- I saw him!
- We gotta get pressure

13:09.164 --> 13:11.541
- from this man to hold us up.
- He's not giving him pressure!

13:11.625 --> 13:14.336
He didn't at the time! Hello, Gale.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.005
Sit down.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.716
You know Ed McCaskey, J.C.

13:19.800 --> 13:23.970
- I'll call you back on it, all right?
- Want some iced tea?

13:24.054 --> 13:26.097
Yeah. Please.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.891
There you go.

13:35.357 --> 13:38.026
I'll tell you what we want to talk
to you about, Gale.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.487
See, I'm, uh--

13:41.404 --> 13:43.740
Well, I'm an old-timer in a lot of ways.

13:44.908 --> 13:47.702
At least that's what
some people keep telling me.

13:49.913 --> 13:53.375
But I don't think it's all that common
for a man of my age to...

13:54.376 --> 13:56.670
well, to be used to the way things are.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.880
To be comfortable with things.

14:01.591 --> 14:06.179
What it comes down to
is that J.C. had a notion here,

14:06.763 --> 14:09.140
and Ed seems to think it's a good idea.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.186
And I guess maybe we are due
for some changes around here.

14:13.895 --> 14:16.064
You want me to play flanker,
not running back.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.858
Heh, no, no, no.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.360
No, it's not that simple, Gale.

14:20.443 --> 14:24.197
It's J.C.'s idea, and yes,
I did agree with him.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.617
This is 1965,

14:27.701 --> 14:33.164
and we'd like the Bears to room together
according to position, without any regard to race.

14:34.165 --> 14:36.585
So we'd like you and Brian Piccolo
to room together.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.214
That's all?

14:42.757 --> 14:43.884
That's what this is about?

14:43.967 --> 14:46.636
- Is that all?
- Yeah.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.598
You had me worried.
I thought it was something really--

14:49.681 --> 14:53.810
This is something, really. A white man
and a black man rooming together on a team--

14:53.894 --> 14:55.770
That's never been done before.

14:55.854 --> 14:58.189
You're gonna be called
a Tom by some blacks...

14:58.815 --> 15:01.359
and uppity nigger by some whites.

15:01.443 --> 15:05.488
When we go on the road, man,
I'm talking about Atlanta, Houston,

15:05.572 --> 15:07.782
Miami, New Orleans.

15:07.866 --> 15:11.411
It ain't gonna be no better in Detroit
or Minnesota or San Francisco

15:11.494 --> 15:13.622
or any other town we play in.

15:13.705 --> 15:15.790
You gonna rock the boat, Sayers,

15:15.874 --> 15:18.668
and there's people out there
that's already seasick.

15:18.752 --> 15:21.755
What J.C. is saying
is that there may be some pressures.

15:22.505 --> 15:23.924
Severe ones.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.387
Now, what do you say?

15:48.657 --> 15:51.409
Hi. Gonna be rooming together.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.954
- Says who?
- Who else?

15:57.082 --> 15:58.541
That's terrific.

16:00.669 --> 16:03.713
Sort of a shame he couldn't ask me
how I felt about it, isn't it?

16:03.797 --> 16:04.881
Look, you want me out?

16:06.424 --> 16:08.051
Nah.

16:08.176 --> 16:11.388
I don't want you out.
Stay. I guess I'm just...

16:11.930 --> 16:16.518
steamed at the old man for not putting me
in that scrimmage this afternoon.

16:18.687 --> 16:21.022
That your, uh-- That your wife?

16:21.106 --> 16:24.484
- Yeah.
- Pretty.

16:24.567 --> 16:28.196
- So's yours, and the little girl.
- Thanks.

16:29.823 --> 16:34.285
Supposed to call her tonight,
tell her how I'm going.

16:36.913 --> 16:39.499
I guess that might be the shortest
phone call in history.

16:39.582 --> 16:40.959
Maybe not.

16:41.668 --> 16:42.877
Pick.

16:44.587 --> 16:48.341
They wouldn't assign us to room together
unless we both made the team.

16:53.763 --> 16:55.056
Ah...

16:58.935 --> 17:01.062
That's right, isn't it?

17:02.647 --> 17:04.733
Uh-huh.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.074
- Come on. Let's go call our wives.
- Wait, I just called--

17:13.157 --> 17:17.162
That was just practice. This is for real.
Come on!

17:17.244 --> 17:18.872
Out you go!

17:23.667 --> 17:26.588
Congratulations on making the team,
gentlemen.

17:26.671 --> 17:30.133
- Well done.
- You know, Coach Halas kind of frowns on hazing

17:30.216 --> 17:32.510
- of new men.
- But now that you made the team,

17:32.594 --> 17:34.054
it's like you're one of us!

17:36.264 --> 17:38.850
Welcome to the Chicago Bears!

17:50.820 --> 17:52.655
<i>Pass from Butkus to Sayers</i>

17:52.739 --> 17:54.949
<i>complete for a touchdown for the Bears.</i>

18:13.551 --> 18:15.178
Beautiful game.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.894
Is playing in the NFL any easier
than you thought it would be?

18:22.977 --> 18:25.480
My first game. I'm not exactly an expert.

18:25.563 --> 18:26.481
J.C. Caroline says

18:26.564 --> 18:30.735
he hasn't seen anybody carry the ball
for the Bears like that since Willie Galimore.

18:30.819 --> 18:31.986
The blocks were there.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.697
That's not what you said last night.

18:35.365 --> 18:39.828
You called the offensive line the, uh,
seven blocks of Silly Putty, I think it was.

18:39.911 --> 18:41.371
Pick.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.956
You're Brian Piccolo.

18:43.665 --> 18:48.128
Sure, uh, that's right.
Piccolo. P-I-C-C-O-L-O.

18:48.253 --> 18:52.173
You two are the only black and white player
rooming together on the team.

18:52.257 --> 18:53.925
Uh, any problems so far?

18:54.467 --> 18:56.678
Not as long as he doesn't use the bathroom.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.763
- Heh, heh.
- Pick.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.819
<i>Hey, uh, Gale, when you run,</i>

19:12.902 --> 19:15.822
<i>do you think about what you're doing,
or do you just do it?</i>

19:16.573 --> 19:20.743
<i>- I just do it.
- Well, start thinking about it, will you?</i>

19:20.827 --> 19:22.495
<i>I wanna play some too.</i>

19:26.332 --> 19:30.295
- Better save it. Heh, heh. Anyway, so--
- Ha, ha, ha.

19:30.420 --> 19:33.840
Concannon calls this trap play, see?
You know what a trap play is?

19:33.923 --> 19:35.758
Um, uh, yeah. I think so.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.973
A trap play is when all
the linemen go one way,

19:42.056 --> 19:45.101
and hopefully the defense goes the same way,
and if they do,

19:45.185 --> 19:47.770
see, there's a big hole, and if they don't,
well, it's bad news.

19:48.396 --> 19:50.648
Anyway, Concannon calls this trap play,

19:50.732 --> 19:54.152
and, uh, it's beautiful 43 yards--
Wasn't it 43?

19:54.694 --> 19:57.363
- I think--
- And Halas sees he's tired,

19:57.447 --> 20:01.159
and, uh, sends me in,
so I go in, he comes out.

20:01.242 --> 20:03.953
Concannon figures he's gonna
get really foxy, you know.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.163
Concannon is...

20:07.874 --> 20:09.584
He says, "Same play."

20:10.251 --> 20:11.920
Very same play.

20:12.003 --> 20:15.506
Trap play is also called a sucker play,

20:15.590 --> 20:18.551
because it makes the defense look real bad
when it works.

20:18.635 --> 20:22.347
And defenses do not like to look real bad, see.
Makes them kind of surly.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.558
Anyway, all the linemen go this way,

20:25.642 --> 20:29.229
and it's like I am looking at a team portrait
of the Los Angeles Rams.

20:29.312 --> 20:32.232
Hey, Deacon, Merlin.
How's the family, Rosey?

20:34.192 --> 20:37.737
I was afraid to get up.
I figured not everything was gonna come with me.

20:37.820 --> 20:41.658
You've never seen anyone so black and blue
in your life.

20:41.741 --> 20:45.745
It's like I'm rooming
with a colored player again.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.832
Gale told a joke!

20:53.586 --> 20:56.339
The stone face from Kansas speaks.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.801
All right. Hey, Chicago! Chicago!

20:59.884 --> 21:02.220
Sayers speaks! He speaks.

21:03.054 --> 21:04.555
<i>Hey, Black Magic.</i>

21:05.223 --> 21:07.016
<i>Listen to this letter I got.</i>

21:07.850 --> 21:12.230
<i>"You must have been raised with pigs to stay
in the same room with one of those darkies.</i>

21:12.313 --> 21:15.858
<i>You must not have been taught anything
when you were a boy.</i>

21:15.942 --> 21:18.820
<i>You must have crawled out
from under some slimy rock."</i>

21:20.280 --> 21:22.532
<i>- Is that all?
- Except the usual:</i>

21:22.615 --> 21:23.616
<i>"Love, Mother."</i>

21:28.162 --> 21:31.666
<i>Magic, I think I'm gonna
write you a speech.</i>

21:31.749 --> 21:33.126
<i>What kind of speech?</i>

21:33.209 --> 21:34.669
<i>An acceptance speech.</i>

21:34.752 --> 21:36.671
<i>Rookie of the year. You can't miss.</i>

21:36.754 --> 21:39.716
<i>And I gotta give a speech? Heh. No way.</i>

21:42.677 --> 21:46.639
The man we're honoring tonight was a
two-time all-American at the University of Kansas.

21:46.723 --> 21:50.310
He was the top draft choice
of the Chicago Bears of 1965,

21:50.393 --> 21:54.939
and three times during the course of the season,
he gained 100 or more yards.

21:55.023 --> 21:58.026
Perhaps his best individual
performance came last December...

21:58.109 --> 22:00.028
- All right. Go ahead. From the top.
- All right.

22:00.111 --> 22:02.238
I wanna thank you all for this honor,

22:02.322 --> 22:05.867
but I really think it's not right
to give it to one man.

22:05.950 --> 22:09.662
Uh, football is a team sport.

22:09.746 --> 22:11.539
And, uh--

22:11.622 --> 22:13.333
Here he is, rookie of the year.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.376
Start from the top. Look up.

22:15.460 --> 22:16.419
Gale Sayers!

22:52.997 --> 22:55.625
Uh... Ahem.

22:56.250 --> 22:58.336
I'd like to thank you all for this honor.

22:59.087 --> 23:00.671
Though it's not really right--

23:22.944 --> 23:24.320
Thank you.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.951
Who'd believe it?

23:32.453 --> 23:34.705
I mean, who would ever believe it?

23:37.250 --> 23:39.001
Dumb.

23:44.006 --> 23:46.717
All right. Let's go, on the line.
Davis. Turner.

23:48.177 --> 23:51.472
Ready, set, go.

23:52.557 --> 23:54.142
Seely, Riles.

23:55.518 --> 23:59.105
Ready, set, go.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.442
O'Bradovich, Caroline.

24:03.109 --> 24:06.362
Since when does the defensive lineman
have to race the defensive halfback?

24:06.446 --> 24:08.489
You're not racing me.
You're racing the clock.

24:08.573 --> 24:09.991
I ought to have a handicap.

24:10.074 --> 24:13.578
Well, you said the defensive backfield
was your handicap all last year, O.B.

24:13.661 --> 24:15.955
Aw, shut up. You're still a rookie to me.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.290
Cut it out.

24:17.373 --> 24:20.126
Pick, get back in line. Ready, set--

24:21.919 --> 24:26.299
- Hey! You just get in?
- Yeah. I would've been earlier,

24:26.382 --> 24:28.968
but my plane got fogged in in Detroit.

24:31.596 --> 24:33.347
You look like you're in pretty good shape.

24:33.431 --> 24:35.975
I worked hard all winter.
You get a chance to talk to Linda today?

24:36.058 --> 24:38.561
- No. Why?
- Thought you might've heard.

24:38.644 --> 24:39.770
Joy's expecting again.

24:39.854 --> 24:41.314
- Hey, that's great.
- We think so.

24:41.397 --> 24:43.774
- If it's a boy, we'd like to name it after you.
- No kidding.

24:43.858 --> 24:46.068
- It's got a real nice ring to it.
- Ready. Set. Go!

24:46.152 --> 24:47.612
Spade Piccolo.

24:52.575 --> 24:54.035
Last season is history.

24:54.118 --> 24:57.163
You're gonna run and hit
and hurt and run some more.

24:57.246 --> 25:00.541
All right, let's go.
Forty-two trap. Piccolo up.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.506
Brian, that's the way to go!

25:07.006 --> 25:09.759
See, Sayers,
that's why you will never make it.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.302
Pizza has magical properties

25:11.385 --> 25:14.055
that give Italian guys a lot of speed,
you understand?

25:14.138 --> 25:17.266
- Oh, yeah. A lot of great Italian running backs.
- That's right, there are.

25:17.350 --> 25:19.435
There's Leroy Kellian, Lennie Morenelli.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.896
- All them guys. Hey, J.C.
- Hey, Brian.

25:21.979 --> 25:23.981
- That Sunday's lineup?
- Yeah.

25:24.065 --> 25:25.191
What's the backfield?

25:25.274 --> 25:28.569
Concannon, Ralph Kurek and you.

25:40.164 --> 25:42.542
Come on, Magic. Pizza's gonna get cold.

25:54.387 --> 25:56.180
Come on. Let's go, there!

25:58.266 --> 25:59.559
You got him now!

26:08.401 --> 26:09.610
<i>Bears' ball.</i>

26:09.694 --> 26:12.697
<i>First and ten on the San Francisco
42-yard line.</i>

26:13.322 --> 26:16.409
- Come on, Bobby! Let's go.
- All right, let's go, Bobby!

26:18.202 --> 26:21.622
Yours, Gale. Twenty-eight toss.
And on three.

26:21.706 --> 26:23.249
All right, let's go. Come on.

27:30.524 --> 27:31.984
- Let me help you.
- No.

28:14.652 --> 28:18.239
- Gale, it's just so good to have you home.
- It's good to be home.

28:19.281 --> 28:20.574
Can I get you anything?

28:21.701 --> 28:23.911
Nope. I'm fine.

28:34.755 --> 28:37.717
It's almost lunch time.
Would you like a sandwich or something?

28:38.300 --> 28:40.678
No, I'm not hungry. You go ahead though.

28:44.014 --> 28:47.685
Well, I left the kids at Joy's,
so I guess I'd better go pick them up.

28:48.769 --> 28:50.813
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah.

28:50.896 --> 28:54.150
- You sure?
- Yes! I'm sure.

29:20.551 --> 29:23.053
♪ Their sons, they are many ♪

29:23.137 --> 29:24.847
♪ Unrivaled by any ♪

29:25.890 --> 29:28.225

29:35.816 --> 29:37.026
That you, Magic?

29:37.860 --> 29:40.237
Yes, it is. Thought you'd never get here.

29:40.905 --> 29:42.239
What are you doing down here?

29:42.323 --> 29:45.659
Now, that is not a bad act.
But Peg Leg Bates does do it a little better.

29:45.743 --> 29:47.703
What is that thing supposed to be?

29:48.496 --> 29:51.207
That is not supposed to be
anything other than what it is,

29:51.290 --> 29:53.000
which is a leg-lift machine.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.294
- What for?
- What for?

29:55.377 --> 30:00.800
Well, uh, getting that knee back in shape
is not gonna be a take-it-easy proposition.

30:02.218 --> 30:05.012
Well, if you're afraid,
I mean, that's understandable.

30:06.889 --> 30:08.182
I'm not afraid.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.614
You ought to be afraid, Gale.

30:23.697 --> 30:27.535
I am not afraid. I'm just tired
of being bugged by reporters, Linda, you!

30:27.618 --> 30:30.037
Hey, you know,
you are a real charmer, Sayers.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.330
An absolute saint.

30:31.413 --> 30:35.334
- Look, maybe you think it's a real friendly thing--
- Hey. You can stick that in your ditty bag too,

30:35.417 --> 30:37.044
you dumb jackass.

30:39.797 --> 30:41.590
You know, Gale, when, uh...

30:43.175 --> 30:45.553
when I was in high school...

30:48.180 --> 30:50.432
I was one of the best backs in the state.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.893
Unfortunately for me,

30:52.977 --> 30:55.980
the best back in the state,
Tucker Fredrickson,

30:56.272 --> 30:57.690
went to the same school.

30:58.691 --> 31:01.861
The colleges used to come down
and watch us play.

31:01.944 --> 31:06.824
And, uh, ol' Tuck, he wound up at Auburn,
and I wound up at Wake Forest.

31:07.741 --> 31:10.160
Good school, nice place. But, uh--

31:10.786 --> 31:14.039
Well, not exactly center ring.
You understand?

31:15.749 --> 31:19.753
So I worked my tail off at, uh, Forest.

31:20.588 --> 31:22.256
My senior year...

31:23.007 --> 31:26.093
I led the nation in rushing and scoring.

31:28.053 --> 31:30.848
I mean, I led the entire nation.

31:31.974 --> 31:36.312
So I go look for a pro team,
and I pick the Bears.

31:37.771 --> 31:41.567
Now, who else comes to the Bears?
Mr. Sayers.

31:41.650 --> 31:44.194
Big guns, big school.

31:44.278 --> 31:46.322
I'm number two all over again.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.493
Well, ol' buddy,

31:51.577 --> 31:53.203
I'm number one guy now.

31:54.288 --> 31:55.873
But for all the wrong reasons.

31:57.458 --> 32:00.002
Unless you come back 100 percent,

32:00.085 --> 32:02.212
well, people are gonna say...

32:03.130 --> 32:04.798
Piccolo got in on a pass.

32:06.383 --> 32:09.136
Lucky break. See,
I don't want it like that.

32:09.219 --> 32:11.221
I'm gonna whip you, Sayers.

32:12.723 --> 32:16.477
But you gotta be at your best,
or it won't mean a thing.

32:16.560 --> 32:20.940
You're not gonna be one second slower
or one degree weaker.

32:23.859 --> 32:27.571
I am gonna work your tail off
to get that leg back in shape.

32:27.655 --> 32:29.448
For my sake.

32:29.531 --> 32:30.991
You got that?

32:46.256 --> 32:48.008
<i>Now for sports.</i>

32:48.092 --> 32:52.096
<i>In Los Angeles, the Chicago Bears
trimmed the Rams by a score of 17 to 16.</i>

32:52.179 --> 32:55.224
<i>Quarterback Jack Concannon
was eight for 14 passing,</i>

32:55.307 --> 32:58.268
<i>and the running game was ably
manned by Brian Piccolo,</i>

32:58.352 --> 33:01.146
<i>who gained 105 yards in 14 carries.</i>

33:01.230 --> 33:03.273
<i>Piccolo was awarded the game ball.</i>

33:03.357 --> 33:06.068
<i>Also on the West Coast,
the San Francisco Forty-niners--</i>

33:14.076 --> 33:16.662
<i>- Hello.
- Dr. Fox. This is Brian Piccolo.</i>

33:16.745 --> 33:17.955
<i>How's he doing?</i>

33:18.038 --> 33:20.457
<i>Pretty well, Brian, I think.
Though it is boring</i>

33:20.541 --> 33:23.460
<i>going through all those exercises
all by yourself.</i>

33:23.544 --> 33:26.630
<i>It's drudgery and it's painful.
A lot of people just give up</i>

33:26.714 --> 33:28.966
<i>when they're alone in that situation.</i>

33:37.516 --> 33:39.476
Four. That's good, babe.

33:43.605 --> 33:44.857
Five!

33:45.941 --> 33:47.526
Ah! No way.

33:47.609 --> 33:50.571
Now, don't bone me, man.
Come on. Hang tough.

33:50.654 --> 33:52.406
Five more and that's it
for tonight.

33:52.489 --> 33:55.034
Come on. Five more. Get tough.

33:56.618 --> 33:58.328
That's six.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.290
Seven.

34:02.166 --> 34:03.959
Get it up. Eight.

34:05.252 --> 34:07.504
No way. No way.

34:08.422 --> 34:09.630
I can't...

34:09.715 --> 34:11.175
Can't make it, huh?

34:12.342 --> 34:14.386
Nigger. Chicken nigger.

34:14.469 --> 34:18.056
Oh, Pick.
Don't make me laugh, please.

34:26.398 --> 34:30.152
"I know what I'll do." Ha, ha, ha!
"I'll call Gale a nigger,

34:30.319 --> 34:33.197
and he'll do all of them reps,
he'll be so mad!"

34:33.280 --> 34:35.824
Ha, ha, ha, it's too much!

34:37.743 --> 34:39.453
Nigger, nigger.

34:45.542 --> 34:48.212
Lay off. What was I supposed to do,
call you a wop?

34:48.295 --> 34:49.922
Now, that would make me mad.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.094
What are you guys doing?

34:57.137 --> 34:59.139
You wouldn't believe it, baby, but he--

34:59.723 --> 35:03.185
Brian tried to call me a nigger!

35:16.949 --> 35:19.451
First man to the stand for a beer.
All right?

35:19.535 --> 35:20.953
You're on.

36:43.869 --> 36:46.580
I think I-- I owe you a beer.

36:49.082 --> 36:50.626
I think...

36:52.002 --> 36:53.170
I owe you...

36:54.046 --> 36:55.172
a lot more than that.

36:55.255 --> 36:56.590
Ah.

37:00.677 --> 37:02.221
Two beers, please.

37:05.933 --> 37:06.975
You're healthy.

37:10.229 --> 37:11.647
Yeah!

37:15.817 --> 37:16.818
What do you think,

37:16.902 --> 37:18.820
training camp
is some kind of a country club?

37:18.904 --> 37:22.658
Is that what you think?
Because no man's assured of a job around here.

37:22.741 --> 37:25.744
And if you think you are, you got
another think coming, gentlemen!

37:25.827 --> 37:27.913
Get them up. Get them up.

37:27.996 --> 37:31.416
Get them up. Get them up. Come on, Pick.
Get them up!

37:32.376 --> 37:34.753
Come on, Billy. Get them up.

37:36.004 --> 37:38.131
Ow! Ow!

37:54.564 --> 37:55.774
Come in.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.572
- Hi, Brian.
- Oh, hello, coach.

38:03.073 --> 38:05.826
- Mind if I come in?
- Oh, no. Not at all.

38:07.160 --> 38:11.081
- Gale. How's the knee?
- Fine. Real strong.

38:11.832 --> 38:14.418
Excuse me, coach. If you wanna talk
to Gale here for a while,

38:14.501 --> 38:15.794
I'll just, uh, go down--

38:15.877 --> 38:18.297
No, actually, I want to talk
to the both of you.

38:20.757 --> 38:23.260
Well, how things look this year, coach?

38:23.343 --> 38:25.554
Good. Real good.

38:25.637 --> 38:28.640
Matter of fact, there's one boy
I'm very impressed with.

38:28.724 --> 38:32.853
I wouldn't be surprised to see him
replace you as number two halfback.

38:35.397 --> 38:37.899
Because I'm gonna make you
number one fullback.

38:38.775 --> 38:43.864
Hey, Pick! You and me, starting backfield!
What do you say?

38:47.743 --> 38:53.582
Coach, I didn't think it was possible,
but I think you found a way to shut him up!

39:11.433 --> 39:13.894
<i>Touchdown, Piccolo.</i>

39:24.821 --> 39:27.616
<i>Sixty yards and a touchdown
for Gale Sayers.</i>

39:28.492 --> 39:29.910
<i>- Hey, Pick?
- Yo.</i>

39:29.993 --> 39:32.412
<i>You know you got a 4.3 rushing average?</i>

39:32.496 --> 39:33.997
<i>No, but hum a few bars,</i>

39:34.081 --> 39:35.457
<i>I'll see if I can fake it for you.</i>

39:35.540 --> 39:36.958
<i>Oh, Pick.</i>

39:39.961 --> 39:42.089
<i>Touchdown, Piccolo.</i>

39:58.688 --> 40:00.774
Two hundred and forty-one.

40:01.650 --> 40:03.068
Holloway.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.948
Holloway, 251.
Piccolo.

40:08.031 --> 40:09.449
Hey, Gibs!

40:09.533 --> 40:11.785
Scrimmage tomorrow teach us
some new trick plays?

40:11.868 --> 40:14.454
Only trick I'd like to give you
is how to keep some meat on you.

40:14.538 --> 40:15.997
You're down another pound.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.874
What's there is all choice.

40:17.958 --> 40:20.669
Two-oh-six and a quarter.
Skinniest fullback in the league.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.796
Gibs, I don't know
what's the matter with you.

40:22.879 --> 40:25.590
First you sweat all the fat off us,
then you complain we're too thin.

40:25.674 --> 40:28.552
- You're a very hard man to please.
- Get out of here.

40:30.095 --> 40:31.304
Sayers.

40:33.515 --> 40:36.017
Ought to tell your Italian buddy
to load up on the pasta.

40:36.476 --> 40:37.853
Maybe he just wants to be quicker.

40:37.936 --> 40:41.231
Ten pounds lighter?
Half a second slower in the 40-yard sprint?

40:41.314 --> 40:42.858
It ain't working.

40:44.276 --> 40:46.528
Come on, Brian! Hit that hole! Hit it!

40:46.611 --> 40:48.905
What's wrong with you, Piccolo?

40:51.950 --> 40:56.121
What is it, Gale? Is he really hurting?
Gotta move! He's not hitting.

40:56.204 --> 40:58.623
Come on, baby, come on. We gotta get it.

41:03.336 --> 41:05.088
Come on, baby, come on!

41:37.954 --> 41:40.165
- Nice block.
- Thanks.

41:43.084 --> 41:45.670
Must be 90 million pounds
of pollen in the air.

41:55.889 --> 41:59.726
You ought to get Dr. Fox to give you
something for that hay fever.

42:01.811 --> 42:03.480
- Huh?
- He did.

42:03.563 --> 42:05.899
The only thing I'm allergic
to is Nietzchke.

42:06.858 --> 42:08.652
Come on! Stick it in their ear!

42:19.037 --> 42:19.996
Good game, kid.

42:20.080 --> 42:24.000
Looking at you,
I'd never know we won the game.

42:27.837 --> 42:31.591
I don't feel very much
like I'm a winner about now.

42:31.675 --> 42:33.051
Why not?

42:34.135 --> 42:37.472
Gale, I'm sending Brian Piccolo
back to Chicago.

42:37.556 --> 42:41.142
He's not gonna finish
the road trip with us.

42:41.226 --> 42:43.687
Ralph Kurek's gonna start next week.

42:44.145 --> 42:45.272
Why?

42:45.939 --> 42:49.067
Because I've always had a policy on this team,
right from the start.

42:49.150 --> 42:51.528
The best players play, no exceptions.

42:52.654 --> 42:54.656
Right now, Kurek's the best player.

42:54.739 --> 42:57.492
A lot of guys take a while to get started.

42:57.576 --> 43:00.161
And Piccolo has never been
one of those guys.

43:01.204 --> 43:04.207
He's always been in shape,
willing to give a hundred percent.

43:04.708 --> 43:07.669
But he's not doing that anymore.
That's what worries me.

43:09.337 --> 43:10.880
I don't know what it is.

43:10.964 --> 43:15.594
Could be something physical,
or it might be an emotional disturbance.

43:17.178 --> 43:20.015
- Something with his wife, children.
- Pick? Come on!

43:20.098 --> 43:24.436
Well, something's taken the edge off of him.
I gotta find out what that something is.

43:24.519 --> 43:26.396
For his sake as well as the team's.

43:27.355 --> 43:30.483
- When's he gonna find out?
- Abe's telling him now.

43:30.567 --> 43:33.361
That's why I didn't want you to go back
to the hotel right away.

43:33.445 --> 43:34.696
Ah.

43:36.156 --> 43:38.450
I wouldn't want to be
in Abe's shoes right about now.

43:40.327 --> 43:42.787
I wouldn't want to be in your shoes
about ten minutes from now.

43:59.554 --> 44:02.307
Who'd believe it?
I mean, really, who'd believe it?

44:02.390 --> 44:04.309
Halas just wants you to see the doctor.

44:04.392 --> 44:06.019
Halas don't know what he wants.

44:06.895 --> 44:07.979
Gibron's his boy.

44:09.022 --> 44:13.151
You should have heard that lecture.
Wants me to patch things up with Joy.

44:13.234 --> 44:16.112
I say things are fine with me and Joy.

44:16.196 --> 44:20.617
He just smiles that Father Flanagan
smile of his,

44:20.700 --> 44:23.495
and tells me I shouldn't be afraid
to level with him.

44:25.080 --> 44:28.208
- Dear Abby in a jockstrap.
- Pick, be fair.

44:28.291 --> 44:29.709
Dr. Fox says--

44:29.793 --> 44:32.754
Hey, don't give me no crud
about our great team doctor.

44:32.837 --> 44:35.715
Wants me to get a physical for the cough.
No allergy.

44:35.799 --> 44:39.969
"What is it?" I say.
He says, "Well, it could be a virus.

44:40.679 --> 44:44.182
Could be a staph infection.
Could be any one of a thousand things."

44:45.600 --> 44:48.603
Like being treated
in a damn Chinese restaurant.

44:50.980 --> 44:53.817
Two from column A, three from column B.

44:57.570 --> 44:59.656
He's just trying to help.

44:59.739 --> 45:00.824
Yeah.

45:03.326 --> 45:04.411
Yeah.

45:08.707 --> 45:10.208
Well, I--

45:11.000 --> 45:12.794
I guess you're right.

45:17.716 --> 45:19.592
It's all so pointless, Gale.

45:21.970 --> 45:24.723
I mean, I know perfectly well
what's wrong with me.

45:28.852 --> 45:31.146
Gale, I, uh-- I think I'm pregnant.

46:04.929 --> 46:05.889
Yeah.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.057
Hey, coach.

46:08.141 --> 46:10.935
Which end of the field you want me to take
if we lose the toss?

46:14.230 --> 46:16.149
Come in, Gale. Close the door.

46:23.364 --> 46:25.909
We just got a call from the hospital.

46:26.493 --> 46:28.161
Brian Piccolo has cancer.

46:35.418 --> 46:37.045
Oh, God.

46:38.505 --> 46:41.216
They've scheduled an operation
for tomorrow morning.

46:41.841 --> 46:43.134
An operation to do what?

46:43.676 --> 46:45.094
Gale.

46:48.348 --> 46:51.559
They're gonna have to remove
part of Brian's right lung.

47:02.153 --> 47:04.072
The doctors have no explanation.

47:05.573 --> 47:09.327
It's just something that Brian
carried around inside of him all his life.

47:10.537 --> 47:12.497
What kicked it off, they don't know.

47:13.498 --> 47:16.543
Whether or not they got it in time...

47:18.002 --> 47:20.255
well, I'm afraid they don't know that either.

47:27.846 --> 47:29.430
Who's gonna tell them?

47:30.890 --> 47:31.766
I'll tell them.

47:32.225 --> 47:33.351
No.

47:35.895 --> 47:37.605
I'll tell them.

47:38.398 --> 47:40.108
You, Gale?

47:40.191 --> 47:41.985
That's right, me.

47:42.819 --> 47:44.070
I'll tell them.

47:48.658 --> 47:50.159
Let's go.

47:56.249 --> 47:58.793
Let me have your attention a minute,
fellas.

47:58.877 --> 48:00.295
Come on over here.

48:13.308 --> 48:15.768
Gale has something he wants to say to you.

48:16.477 --> 48:17.770
Gale.

48:30.658 --> 48:31.868
Uh...

48:36.831 --> 48:38.583
You, uh...

48:39.876 --> 48:41.419
all know that...

48:43.254 --> 48:45.506
We hand out a game ball to...

48:46.883 --> 48:48.134
the...

48:51.054 --> 48:52.889
outstanding player.

48:54.599 --> 48:56.643
Well, I'd like to change that.

49:01.064 --> 49:02.690
We just got word...

49:05.360 --> 49:07.487
that Brian Piccolo is...

49:11.574 --> 49:13.743
that he's sick, very sick.

49:18.748 --> 49:21.125
And, uh, it looks like, um...

49:28.508 --> 49:30.760
he might never play football...

49:33.012 --> 49:34.555
again.

49:36.474 --> 49:38.059
Or...

49:39.602 --> 49:41.354
for a long time.

49:45.817 --> 49:47.276
And...

49:50.238 --> 49:52.532
I think we should dedicate ourselves...

49:54.325 --> 49:55.743
to, uh...

49:58.621 --> 50:00.665
give our maximum effort...

50:01.624 --> 50:02.875
to win this game...

50:06.671 --> 50:08.506
and give the game ball...

50:09.882 --> 50:10.842
to Pick.

50:14.262 --> 50:16.097
We can all sign it...

50:20.768 --> 50:22.478
and take it up...

50:26.441 --> 50:28.192
to the hos--

50:30.862 --> 50:32.780
Oh, my God!

50:37.910 --> 50:40.580
Fantastic! Could you believe it?

50:41.456 --> 50:44.876
Sayers, I mean, you've got some moves
on the field,

50:44.959 --> 50:48.171
but in the locker room,
you are one big klutz.

50:48.254 --> 50:50.048
Now, listen to me.

50:50.131 --> 50:52.300
Listen, now.

50:52.383 --> 50:54.218
When you dedicate a game to someone,

50:54.302 --> 50:56.679
you are then supposed to go out
and win it, idiot.

50:58.431 --> 51:01.476
You know, Pat O'Brien never said,
"Let's blow one for the Gipper."

51:01.559 --> 51:03.936
Heh, heh, man, you is so bad.

51:04.020 --> 51:07.607
We probably would have won the game
if Concannon had called that trap play more,

51:07.690 --> 51:10.693
but he sort of hates to call it
without you in there for the repeat.

51:17.408 --> 51:18.868
Well...

51:19.702 --> 51:21.704
- Gale.
- Thank you.

51:23.956 --> 51:25.917
Thank you.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.919
Mmm. Beats ham hocks,
don't it?

51:33.382 --> 51:34.592
Ahh...

51:37.720 --> 51:39.972
Hey, anybody wanna see my scar?

51:44.644 --> 51:47.522
- Out. Out, now. No discussion. Out.
- What? Why?

51:47.605 --> 51:50.066
What's the matter? We just got here.

51:51.859 --> 51:55.613
Thank you, gang. See you later, guys.
Thanks for coming.

51:55.696 --> 51:58.950
- You just gonna lay there?
- Hey, J.C., hang on to this, will you?

51:59.033 --> 52:00.118
Later, Pick.

52:07.083 --> 52:12.130
Oh, babe, uh, take Gale down
and have him

52:12.213 --> 52:15.508
give that little girl
his autograph downstairs.

52:15.591 --> 52:17.885
A little girl I met the day I came in.

52:17.969 --> 52:20.012
Had her operation the same day I did.

52:20.096 --> 52:22.223
Told her I'd get her your autograph.

52:22.890 --> 52:24.559
You don't mind, do you?

52:24.642 --> 52:26.686
No problem. I'll be glad to.

52:26.769 --> 52:28.896
All right. You go.

52:37.155 --> 52:39.448
- It's time now, Mrs. Piccolo.
- Thank you.

52:47.206 --> 52:48.499
I'll be right back.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.418
Won't you?

53:12.148 --> 53:13.649
May I help you?

53:18.362 --> 53:21.908
My name is Mrs. Piccolo.
My husband's a patient on the third floor,

53:21.991 --> 53:24.785
and he told me about a little girl,
Patti Lucas,

53:24.869 --> 53:27.121
who wanted this gentleman's autograph.

53:27.205 --> 53:29.790
Uh, Mrs. Piccolo,
Patti isn't with us anymore.

53:29.874 --> 53:31.876
Oh. Well, do you have a home address?

53:31.959 --> 53:34.086
- Mrs. Piccolo, Patti's--
- My husband wanted her

53:34.170 --> 53:35.963
to have the autograph very much.

53:36.964 --> 53:38.174
Come on.

53:43.387 --> 53:45.389
Mrs. Piccolo, Patti's dead.

53:46.933 --> 53:49.060
She passed away early this morning.

54:23.844 --> 54:26.264
Nothing wrong with that knee,
I'll tell you.

54:26.347 --> 54:28.474
Congratulations, Dr. Piccolo.

54:28.557 --> 54:29.892
Yeah.

54:32.687 --> 54:34.772
You know what, Joy?

54:35.731 --> 54:37.441
I've been thinking.

54:37.525 --> 54:41.445
With Gale healthy and Ralph Kurek healthy,

54:41.529 --> 54:45.366
I'm gonna have a real tough time
getting back in that lineup next year.

54:46.659 --> 54:48.077
So I was thinking,

54:49.287 --> 54:51.372
what's so difficult about being a kicker?

54:52.164 --> 54:56.544
I mean, I was just wondering if it was
something you could teach yourself. Huh?

54:57.628 --> 54:59.338
Because you don't need

54:59.422 --> 55:03.050
a great amount of wind or stamina or size.

55:05.720 --> 55:09.056
Well, what do you think of my brainstorm,
old gloomy Gus?

55:09.140 --> 55:10.725
Heh, well, I don't know, Brian.

55:10.808 --> 55:14.228
I mean, I'm no expert
on kickers and things.

55:14.312 --> 55:17.440
You just ran an end run
Red Grange would be proud of.

55:19.692 --> 55:22.611
Don't make fun of me, Brian. I'm scared.

55:23.195 --> 55:25.698
- Well, what of?
- "What of"?

55:26.741 --> 55:29.618
You can't be serious.
You know perfectly well what of.

55:30.161 --> 55:32.163
No, I don't.

55:32.246 --> 55:33.998
I swear to God I don't, honey.

55:35.541 --> 55:37.209
Now, look, I'm, uh--

55:37.293 --> 55:39.128
I'm no idiot.

55:40.004 --> 55:42.923
This thing I got's bad. I know that.

55:43.007 --> 55:46.552
But, uh, why, it's just a detour, Joy.

55:47.595 --> 55:49.764
I'm not gonna let it stop me.

55:49.847 --> 55:52.224
I'm just not. There's no way.

55:54.060 --> 55:55.895
I got too much to do yet, Joy.

56:10.576 --> 56:13.788
<i>Pick it up! Pick it up, you dummy! Gale.</i>

56:13.871 --> 56:15.998
<i>Now, Mr. Piccolo, calm down.</i>

56:16.082 --> 56:18.292
<i>"Calm down"? How can I calm down?</i>

56:18.376 --> 56:20.878
<i>You'd think the ball was wearing
a white sheet.</i>

56:22.713 --> 56:26.801
Well, I was gonna catch it,
but when it started coming down, I said to myself:

56:26.884 --> 56:30.346
"I wonder what Pick would do
in a situation like this,"

56:30.429 --> 56:32.973
and dropping it seemed to be the answer.

56:33.057 --> 56:37.645
- Well, at least you won the game.
<i>- That's right.</i>

56:38.437 --> 56:42.066
Yeah. And you didn't dedicate this one to me,
though, did you?

56:42.149 --> 56:44.360
Nope. Dedicated it to Butkus.

56:44.860 --> 56:46.654
- Why?
- Because he threatened us.

56:46.737 --> 56:49.323
Heh. How are you doing, Pick, seriously?

56:50.324 --> 56:53.661
I, uh-- I'm, uh...

56:53.786 --> 56:55.371
I'm hanging in there, Magic.

56:56.747 --> 56:58.958
Just doing what they tell me to do.

57:00.459 --> 57:01.544
Hey, listen.

57:02.878 --> 57:04.672
You do me a favor, huh?

57:05.339 --> 57:07.299
<i>You got it. Name it.</i>

57:08.634 --> 57:10.803
Call Joy, will you?

57:11.220 --> 57:13.639
When she left here tonight, she, uh...

57:14.557 --> 57:17.601
Well, she was really down.
I never saw her that down, you know?

57:18.686 --> 57:21.439
Uh-huh. I'll call her
as soon as I get back.

57:21.522 --> 57:25.443
- Thanks, I appreciate it.
- Okay. Bye.

57:25.526 --> 57:30.114
Phone call for Mr. Sayers. Lady says
it's an emergency. She seemed very upset.

57:30.197 --> 57:32.908
- I'll take it.
- I hope I did the right thing.

57:32.992 --> 57:35.453
I'm sure you did. Thank you very much.

57:37.746 --> 57:40.291
- Gale.
- Thank you.

57:44.628 --> 57:45.671
From Joy Piccolo.

57:50.217 --> 57:55.723
I know it's an awful thing to ask you to come back
here in the middle of the night, but--

57:55.806 --> 57:58.809
It doesn't bother us,
so don't let it bother you.

58:04.273 --> 58:05.566
Joy?

58:06.275 --> 58:07.776
Why don't you just say it?

58:11.071 --> 58:12.865
They found more of the tumor.

58:20.164 --> 58:21.624
They, uh--

58:23.292 --> 58:25.211
They told me this morning...

58:25.794 --> 58:27.922
that they want to operate again.

58:31.509 --> 58:34.011
I was going to tell Brian...

58:36.055 --> 58:40.351
but I-- I just couldn't, Gale.

58:44.063 --> 58:48.984
I mean, I don't know whether or not
he can take the disappointment.

58:51.487 --> 58:52.988
And if he can't...

58:54.365 --> 58:56.075
I know I can't.

59:00.829 --> 59:02.331
The, uh...

59:04.041 --> 59:08.671
the doctor is going to tell him
in the morning...

59:12.216 --> 59:14.051
and if you could be there, Gale...

59:15.010 --> 59:16.345
it might help.

59:21.350 --> 59:22.643
I'll be there, Joy.

59:31.443 --> 59:33.279
- What'd you try?
- End run.

59:33.404 --> 59:36.198
Oh, Lordy.
I had my linebackers in a blitz.

59:36.282 --> 59:37.533
All right.

59:39.994 --> 59:41.370
Well, did you gain or what?

59:42.788 --> 59:44.206
Come in.

59:45.791 --> 59:48.210
Oh, I'm sorry if I'm disturbing anything.

59:48.752 --> 59:50.588
Come on in. Not at all.

59:51.255 --> 59:53.632
I can beat him later.
What can I help you with?

59:53.716 --> 59:56.969
Well, I know this is a bother at a time like this,
Mr. Piccolo,

59:57.052 --> 59:59.763
but hospitals have rules and regulations,
you see.

59:59.847 --> 01:00:03.559
- I need your signature on this.
- What is it?

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:04.935
Well, it...

01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:10.482
The doctor has been here, hasn't he?

01:00:10.566 --> 01:00:13.152
- He's talked to you, I mean.
- No, why?

01:00:13.861 --> 01:00:15.529
Oh, well...

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:18.449
- I'll stop back a little later.
- No, wait.

01:00:22.328 --> 01:00:24.747
What would the doctor have to say to me?

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:26.165
Mr.--

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.052
Talk to me, Magic.

01:00:41.597 --> 01:00:43.015
Um...

01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:47.686
The tests show...

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:55.402
There's more of the tumor
than they thought, Pick.

01:00:57.071 --> 01:00:59.031
They have to operate again.

01:01:31.105 --> 01:01:34.024
- So if you'll just sign this consent, Mr.--
- Uh-uh.

01:01:34.108 --> 01:01:35.192
But, Mr. Piccolo--

01:01:35.275 --> 01:01:37.111
I said no, man. Are you deaf?

01:01:39.822 --> 01:01:41.699
Mr. Sayers, can't you talk to your friend?

01:01:43.659 --> 01:01:44.702
Mr. Eberle...

01:01:45.661 --> 01:01:47.788
I think I'd rather talk to you.

01:01:50.791 --> 01:01:52.084
Uh...

01:01:53.752 --> 01:01:56.213
Brian is a professional athlete,
Mr. Eberle.

01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:58.632
A professional gets
into a habit after a while.

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:03.387
He gets himself ready for a game,
mentally as well as physically.

01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:08.058
Because he knows
those two things are all tied up together.

01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:11.228
And there's a clock inside...

01:02:12.521 --> 01:02:14.648
and when the game starts...

01:02:15.607 --> 01:02:18.610
he's 100 percent, mentally and physically.

01:02:18.694 --> 01:02:20.446
Now, what Brian is saying,

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:24.742
is that you're scheduling the game
before he can get ready.

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:31.206
Now, couldn't it wait until
over the weekend?

01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:34.334
- Well, yes, it could, but--
- Then let it.

01:02:39.715 --> 01:02:42.217
First thing Monday morning, Mr. Piccolo?

01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:49.558
I'll see you then.

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:36.730
- Thanks, Magic.
- No sweat.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.167
It looks like I scored a touchdown.

01:04:06.969 --> 01:04:10.305
Mr. Piccolo, we're gonna put you
to sleep now.

01:04:11.223 --> 01:04:13.684
That, uh, couldn't be...

01:04:14.726 --> 01:04:17.813
the worst choice of words
I've ever heard in my life.

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:19.648
<i>The winner of this year's</i>

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:22.067
George S. Halas
most courageous player award:

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:23.569
Gale Sayers.

01:04:50.596 --> 01:04:54.683
I'd like to say a few words about a guy I know,
a friend of mine.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.395
His name is Brian Piccolo...

01:04:59.855 --> 01:05:01.690
and he has the heart of a giant...

01:05:04.026 --> 01:05:09.448
And that rare form of courage which allows him
to kid himself and his opponent:

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:12.659
cancer.

01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:21.501
He has the mental attitude which makes me proud
to have a friend who spells out courage,

01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:25.255
twenty-four hours a day,
every day of his life.

01:05:30.594 --> 01:05:32.095
Now, you flatter me...

01:05:34.014 --> 01:05:36.224
by giving me this award.

01:05:38.644 --> 01:05:40.646
But I say to you here and now...

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:47.945
Brian Piccolo is the man of courage
who should receive the George S. Halas award.

01:05:53.492 --> 01:05:55.452
It's mine tonight...

01:05:58.747 --> 01:06:00.832
and Brian Piccolo's tomorrow.

01:06:10.509 --> 01:06:12.511
I love Brian Piccolo...

01:06:15.847 --> 01:06:18.141
and I'd like all of you to love him too.

01:06:21.228 --> 01:06:24.648
And tonight, when you hit your knees...

01:06:32.239 --> 01:06:34.783
please ask God to love him.

01:07:01.226 --> 01:07:02.894
Hi, Magic.

01:07:03.437 --> 01:07:05.105
How are you doing, Pick?

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:06.606
Oh, I'm...

01:07:07.441 --> 01:07:09.026
I'm hanging in there.

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:12.112
I heard what you did at that, uh...

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:15.240
banquet last night.
You know, if you were here, I'd kiss you.

01:07:15.323 --> 01:07:16.950
I'm glad I'm not there, then.

01:07:18.285 --> 01:07:23.248
Hey, Gale, they, uh, tell me you gave me
a pint of blood. Is that true?

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:25.625
Yep.

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:27.961
That explains it, then.

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:29.796
Explains what?

01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:33.967
I've had this craving for chitlins all day.

01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:40.098
I'll be there tomorrow.

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:42.684
See you then.

01:07:43.101 --> 01:07:44.227
All right.

01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:46.855
I ain't going anywhere.

01:07:52.611 --> 01:07:53.570
Gale.

01:07:53.653 --> 01:07:55.197
How is he, Linda, really?

01:07:56.156 --> 01:07:57.991
Hurry, Gale. Please hurry.

01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:29.147
Brian, Gale's here.

01:08:43.537 --> 01:08:45.287
Hey, Black Magic.

01:08:52.254 --> 01:08:53.839
So bad.

01:08:56.925 --> 01:09:00.220
A racist is what you are, man.

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:05.183
A bigot from head to toe.

01:09:07.853 --> 01:09:09.645
You better believe it, man.

01:09:15.277 --> 01:09:16.569
How are you doing, Pick?

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:18.988
Oh...

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:26.246
It's, uh, fourth and eight,

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:28.290
and they, uh...

01:09:30.584 --> 01:09:32.042
they won't let me punt.

01:09:36.006 --> 01:09:37.506
Go for it, then.

01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:42.595
I'm trying, Gale.

01:09:45.223 --> 01:09:46.600
Jesus...

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:51.229
Jesus God, I'm trying.

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:20.800
Hey, uh...

01:10:24.054 --> 01:10:25.347
Remember when...

01:10:26.181 --> 01:10:28.141
you got me with those mashed potatoes?

01:10:34.231 --> 01:10:36.024
You deserved it.

01:10:39.152 --> 01:10:43.114
The way you sang that dumb fight song.

01:10:46.243 --> 01:10:48.578
And that 32 trap play.

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:51.248
Remember?

01:10:52.499 --> 01:10:53.792
I'm...

01:10:54.334 --> 01:10:56.002
I'm gonna...

01:10:59.214 --> 01:11:01.841
I'm gonna get you next training camp.

01:11:02.509 --> 01:11:04.010
I'm gonna get you.

01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:12.894
I'll be waiting.

01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:18.066
Hey, Gale, I'm--

01:11:19.734 --> 01:11:21.486
I'm feeling a little, uh...

01:11:23.113 --> 01:11:24.322
punk...

01:11:26.366 --> 01:11:28.243
so I think I'll, uh...

01:11:29.077 --> 01:11:33.164
try to-- try to get some sack, okay?

01:11:36.376 --> 01:11:37.460
Okay.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.385
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:48.054
Mmm. If you say so.

01:12:16.458 --> 01:12:18.001
Brian.

01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:32.182
I love you, Brian.

01:12:34.434 --> 01:12:36.186
I love you.

01:12:48.406 --> 01:12:50.492
Who'd believe it, Joy?

01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:56.122
Who'd ever believe it?

01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:15.558
<i>Brian Piccolo died of cancer
at the age of 26.</i>

01:13:15.642 --> 01:13:18.103
<i>He left a wife and three daughters.</i>

01:13:18.186 --> 01:13:21.147
<i>He also left a great many loving friends
who'll miss him</i>

01:13:21.231 --> 01:13:23.024
<i>and think of him often.</i>

01:13:23.108 --> 01:13:24.859
<i>But when they think of him,</i>

01:13:24.943 --> 01:13:27.237
<i>it's not how he died that they remember,</i>

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.780
<i>but rather how he lived.</i>

01:13:28.863 --> 01:13:30.949
<i>How he did live.</i>
