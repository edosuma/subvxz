00:50.058 --> 00:57.899
They say a fire calls you into the forest.

00:59.650 --> 01:07.650
The cold will make you desperate for fire.

01:10.495 --> 01:13.414
But no matter how long you run...

01:14.832 --> 01:19.879
You cannot catch the fire.

01:22.048 --> 01:29.555
You run and run until your mind is sick

01:30.598 --> 01:35.937
and the spirits take you over.

01:36.938 --> 01:41.651
You become wild.

01:43.027 --> 01:46.572
You become Gaagiixid.

02:24.735 --> 02:30.741
Edge of the Knife

04:11.259 --> 04:12.593
Father!

04:12.677 --> 04:14.762
Gaas is here!

04:48.504 --> 04:49.839
Gaas!

05:00.766 --> 05:02.935
I made this for you.

05:03.894 --> 05:04.895
Thanks!

05:17.116 --> 05:19.827
Get along, you wild thing.

05:30.212 --> 05:32.798
Every summer, Gaaxuustaa 'Laana
paddle south

05:32.882 --> 05:36.052
to live alongside their relatives,
the Tllda Gawaay Kii Gawaay family.

05:36.135 --> 05:38.512
Together they prepare food for winter.

06:57.842 --> 06:59.135
Uncle?

06:59.218 --> 07:00.052
Yep?

07:00.136 --> 07:02.513
Do you know if today's weather
will be good?

07:02.596 --> 07:04.765
Can we catch black cod?

07:09.854 --> 07:13.691
You've been greedy for black cod
since you were a little baby.

07:15.359 --> 07:18.028
Black cod was your first food, Gaas.

07:18.946 --> 07:21.365
That's why you're so fat, Gaas.

07:26.245 --> 07:28.330
Well, Gaas eats all the black cod...

07:28.414 --> 07:31.584
What's your excuse, Kwa?

07:35.546 --> 07:36.546
Uncle!

07:39.717 --> 07:42.761
You are so careless, Adiits'ii.

07:46.098 --> 07:47.933
You're hurt.

07:50.019 --> 07:52.021
Let me fix you up.

08:18.380 --> 08:21.634
What's so funny?

08:23.469 --> 08:30.893
I'm thinking about Adiits'ii
at the halibut rack today.

08:32.895 --> 08:34.063
Yes...

08:34.522 --> 08:36.690
But that's not so funny.

08:36.774 --> 08:40.778
He's a bad example for Gaas.

08:41.445 --> 08:45.616
He doesn't always act with respect.

08:46.367 --> 08:51.247
He doesn't know how to be careful.

08:58.879 --> 09:06.879
If Adiits'ii lost his canoe,

09:10.182 --> 09:15.396
Gaas would think he had burned it
at a potlatch.

09:18.190 --> 09:23.195
Jeez! Is Adiits'ii all you're going
to think about?

11:42.710 --> 11:45.421
Look at that Octopus head.

11:45.504 --> 11:47.423
The legs show where
the weather will come from.

11:48.298 --> 11:52.594
In time, when you look up in the sky

11:52.678 --> 11:54.680
you will know what the clouds tell you.

11:54.972 --> 11:57.599
Today will be a good day.

12:10.070 --> 12:13.657
Does Adiits'ii understand weather?

12:19.163 --> 12:21.081
Yes, he's good.

12:30.215 --> 12:33.761
Does that tell us something, too, Father?

12:38.891 --> 12:39.891
And that?

12:44.730 --> 12:48.817
And also everything we see?

12:53.739 --> 12:57.284
What about in darkness?

12:57.367 --> 13:02.790
How is there weather if we don't see it?

13:39.034 --> 13:43.539
He is just as he was
in his last incarnation.

13:44.998 --> 13:48.460
My husband adored black cod.

13:48.794 --> 13:50.527
When he ate it, he would run
his greasy fingers

13:50.587 --> 13:51.588
right through his hair.

13:51.672 --> 13:54.049
It made his hair stick up real funny.

13:57.886 --> 14:01.223
When Hlaay. ya was pregnant,

14:01.306 --> 14:03.934
Grandmother had a dream about Tluuxaad.

14:04.810 --> 14:09.690
Just look at Gaas,
and you'll know it's true.

14:11.441 --> 14:15.028
That's why he used to crawl

14:15.112 --> 14:19.825
into bed with me when he was little!

14:20.868 --> 14:24.538
For goodness' sake, he was my husband.

14:24.621 --> 14:29.918
And I've always said what
a generous woman you are.

14:36.425 --> 14:38.385
Who was I long ago?

14:41.013 --> 14:43.682
You don't even want to know.

14:48.687 --> 14:55.611
I'll cry real hard when I have
to leave all you ladies.

14:56.278 --> 14:57.279
Yes... yes.

16:01.551 --> 16:06.473
Everyone has enough.

16:07.099 --> 16:10.560
This will probably be
our last meal together.

16:11.144 --> 16:13.105
But the weather's so good.

16:17.401 --> 16:20.737
It's important we catch black cod

16:20.862 --> 16:23.156
and then Gaas could come.

16:23.448 --> 16:25.993
Besides, my sister needs some.

16:28.620 --> 16:33.208
You're not even thinking about Sk'aayuu.

16:34.042 --> 16:36.545
You've offered Gaas so many things.

16:36.753 --> 16:39.131
You could've gone as Autumn ended.

16:40.674 --> 16:44.553
Someone throw these halibut bones
in the ocean.

16:48.515 --> 16:49.933
Adiits'ii, you do it.

17:30.932 --> 17:34.144
Tomorrow I'll catch black cod
for my sister.

17:34.227 --> 17:35.771
Are you coming with me?

17:37.230 --> 17:42.194
Tomorrow afternoon
the weather will worsen.

17:42.277 --> 17:45.906
We're going to have to leave.

17:52.621 --> 17:56.249
We could pack without Gaas?

17:59.086 --> 18:02.839
You'll be happier when
the black cod grease

18:02.923 --> 18:04.800
is running down your chin.

18:11.431 --> 18:15.685
Maybe you'll just have
to wait another year

18:15.769 --> 18:17.187
to get black cod.

19:19.833 --> 19:24.421
Something terrible is coming!

21:18.076 --> 21:19.369
Where's Gaas?

22:41.159 --> 22:44.996
Adiits'ii knows what he is doing.

22:45.080 --> 22:48.166
They will be back soon enough.

29:38.701 --> 29:40.578
Alas!

33:41.193 --> 33:42.193
Kwa!

33:53.914 --> 33:56.625
Northwest Wind people are still searching.

33:58.127 --> 33:59.128
Let's go.

34:00.087 --> 34:01.380
The weather is turning bad.

34:01.464 --> 34:03.299
We need to hurry to get back.

34:53.933 --> 34:55.893
Leave it here.

34:55.976 --> 34:58.604
This is all Gaas' gear.

48:02.679 --> 48:04.180
Uncle...

48:12.188 --> 48:14.024
Uncle...

48:19.029 --> 48:20.697
Uncle...

48:27.996 --> 48:29.956
Uncle....

48:30.832 --> 48:32.083
Uncle...

52:32.323 --> 52:34.075
No fish.

53:28.004 --> 53:31.799
Looks like an animal's
been through our camp.

53:36.054 --> 53:37.680
Maybe a bear?

53:39.390 --> 53:42.727
Doesn't look like it came in here.

54:00.828 --> 54:02.288
Bring it in.

54:32.193 --> 54:34.279
What is this here?

54:38.616 --> 54:39.784
Disgusting!

54:39.867 --> 54:41.786
What a stink.

54:42.412 --> 54:45.540
Pity! A lot of work went into this.

54:47.458 --> 54:49.419
Who let this spoil?

54:49.794 --> 54:51.629
Come here you, right here.

54:52.005 --> 54:53.089
Come on.

54:55.091 --> 54:58.636
It smells like rum.

54:58.720 --> 55:00.555
Take it outside.

55:00.638 --> 55:02.098
Throw it away, you two.

55:02.557 --> 55:03.766
Help her out.

55:04.183 --> 55:06.477
I'll help you.

55:34.380 --> 55:36.591
It's difficult to be back here.

55:36.674 --> 55:39.594
Sadness is in everyone.

55:39.677 --> 55:42.638
Sadness is in everything.

55:43.848 --> 55:47.977
I wish people could find their voice.

55:49.979 --> 55:52.774
Even the air feels colder.

55:55.860 --> 55:58.237
Yeah, feel my hands.

57:43.384 --> 57:44.510
Damn!

57:51.517 --> 57:59.517
Everything reminds me of him.

58:02.653 --> 58:07.783
You shouldn't speak ill of the dead.

58:22.340 --> 58:25.468
Have you seen my pestle?

58:42.527 --> 58:43.569
What?

58:44.737 --> 58:45.947
What is this?

59:03.589 --> 59:06.801
I think Adiits'ii has been here.

59:10.721 --> 59:12.306
He died...

59:14.892 --> 59:19.021
Why are you saying that?

59:22.149 --> 59:25.403
There have been other signs.

59:53.973 --> 59:57.643
Poor thing. My hands got old.

59:57.727 --> 59:59.895
I didn't even notice it happening.

59:59.979 --> 01:00:07.236
This weaving looks like a net, not a hat.

01:00:08.404 --> 01:00:11.115
We can use it to catch
ooligans for you, eh?

01:00:15.202 --> 01:00:17.538
You can clean berries with it.

01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:34.722
Hey! Do you hear her?

01:00:34.805 --> 01:00:38.976
She is singing our song!

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:41.562
That's our working song!
Why would she sing that?

01:00:41.646 --> 01:00:43.105
Let's go see her.

01:00:43.189 --> 01:00:44.190
Go ahead.

01:00:54.116 --> 01:00:56.369
Hey! That granddaughter of yours

01:00:56.452 --> 01:00:58.746
is down there singing one of our songs.

01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:01.290
Which song is it?

01:01:02.249 --> 01:01:05.378
It was our working song.

01:01:05.836 --> 01:01:12.468
I don't remember that one.
Sing it so I can learn which one it is.

01:01:12.968 --> 01:01:16.222
Tluujaad will sing it.

01:01:17.056 --> 01:01:25.056
Auntie, why is your face so sad?

01:01:27.233 --> 01:01:33.322
You were fighting with your cousin

01:01:46.001 --> 01:01:49.797
At least give us sweet tobacco then.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:52.508
Here, here it is.

01:01:52.591 --> 01:01:54.218
Thank you.

01:01:55.594 --> 01:01:58.764
That's not much.

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:01.559
For goodness' sake.

01:02:03.185 --> 01:02:04.185
Wait.

01:02:08.274 --> 01:02:10.484
I'll give you seeds as well.

01:02:10.568 --> 01:02:11.736
Thank you.

01:05:27.973 --> 01:05:30.434
It's true, there is a Gaagiid.

01:05:32.645 --> 01:05:34.146
Adiits'ii?

01:05:35.648 --> 01:05:38.317
We need to capture him.

01:05:39.443 --> 01:05:43.197
We'll need to drive
wild spirits out of him.

01:08:32.573 --> 01:08:35.618
It looks like a land otter trail.

01:08:38.913 --> 01:08:43.377
That's just how gaagiid behave.

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:39.390
I ask for your help.
I'm crying out for help.

01:09:39.474 --> 01:09:42.603
Let my brother come home.

01:09:42.685 --> 01:09:45.147
Let him be safe.

01:09:56.074 --> 01:09:56.742
Adiits'ii?

01:09:56.825 --> 01:09:57.910
Adiits'ii!

01:10:23.852 --> 01:10:24.852
Adiits'ii!

01:10:26.605 --> 01:10:28.315
It's me.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.650
Brother.

01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:34.071
Adiits'ii...

01:10:34.363 --> 01:10:36.031
Look at me.

01:10:37.449 --> 01:10:39.868
Do you know who I am?

01:10:42.746 --> 01:10:43.664
Yes.

01:10:43.747 --> 01:10:44.873
It's me.

01:10:45.832 --> 01:10:47.584
Your sister.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.040
Stop!

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:17.465
Stop!

01:12:19.092 --> 01:12:20.052
Kwa, stop!

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:22.137
You are killing him!

01:12:29.603 --> 01:12:30.854
Adiits'ii!

01:13:20.028 --> 01:13:22.531
You were trying to kill him.

01:13:22.614 --> 01:13:24.574
That's why I did that.

01:13:25.409 --> 01:13:27.411
Don't talk to me.

01:13:28.829 --> 01:13:30.997
You were going to kill him.

01:13:33.166 --> 01:13:36.002
He killed your son.

01:13:39.756 --> 01:13:41.925
He's your closest friend.

01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:46.304
Don't you ever tell me that!

01:13:49.057 --> 01:13:53.145
You wouldn't be able to live with yourself
if you killed him.

01:13:56.523 --> 01:13:59.693
You took a stick...

01:13:59.985 --> 01:14:02.696
And you chose Adiits'ii!

01:14:18.712 --> 01:14:20.797
You're not the only one hurting here.

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:27.929
I loved our son, too.

01:14:31.183 --> 01:14:32.559
Our son?

01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:37.481
Our son?

01:14:39.774 --> 01:14:45.572
Everyone knows whose son he was.

01:17:05.337 --> 01:17:07.881
He is ready. He's cleansing.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:15.972
Someone should go talk to him.

01:18:09.943 --> 01:18:12.570
I'm going to end this.

01:18:19.369 --> 01:18:24.040
I'm glad we had this little talk.

01:19:01.327 --> 01:19:04.122
It's powerful medicine.

01:26:19.432 --> 01:26:21.184
He is already cut.

01:26:22.101 --> 01:26:24.896
It has to be deeper.

01:31:31.076 --> 01:31:33.996
It seems cruel.

01:31:39.043 --> 01:31:41.378
It had to be done.

01:32:30.511 --> 01:32:37.351
I always treated him like a son.

01:32:42.439 --> 01:32:44.483
He was your son.

01:33:13.262 --> 01:33:19.852
Tluujaad says she's been dreaming
of our boy.

01:33:31.947 --> 01:33:34.283
My…

01:33:49.923 --> 01:33:56.347
My... son.
