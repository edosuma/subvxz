LIKE THAT OVER A RAZOR,

GETTING HEAVY, ANGELA.

FOR--OH, MY GOD,

THE REST OF
OUR LIVES TOGETHER

18:58.967 --> 19:00.467
AND WONDERING WHY
YOU CAN'T EVEN SHARE

19:00.467 --> 19:01.900
A RAZOR
OR A TOOTHBRUSH.

19:01.900 --> 19:04.033
OK, YOU WANT
REAL HONESTY, TOPANGA?

19:04.033 --> 19:05.867
CAN YOU HANDLE
REAL HONESTY?

19:05.867 --> 19:06.967
I JUST WANT
TO KNOW WHAT
IT'S GONNA TAKE

19:06.967 --> 19:07.967
TO SHARE
YOUR TOOTHBRUSH.

19:07.967 --> 19:09.867
THE TRUTH IS
I COULD NEVER SHARE

19:09.867 --> 19:11.400
ANY OF MY
PERSONAL ITEMS

19:11.400 --> 19:14.100
WITH SOMEONE WHO WON'T
EVEN SHOW ME HER TUSHIE.

19:14.100 --> 19:17.033
NO TUSHIE, NO BRUSHY.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.667
I THINK THAT'S FAIR.

19:22.667 --> 19:24.133
I--WHAT?!

19:27.033 --> 19:29.867
THANK YOU, RACHEL.
I HAD A REALLY NICE TIME.

19:29.867 --> 19:31.600
YOU'RE WELCOME.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.000
COME BACK SOON.

19:34.667 --> 19:40.100
I HAVE SEEN
THE PROMISED LAND!

19:40.100 --> 19:43.100
I SHOWED HIM MY BUTT.

19:43.100 --> 19:48.200
YOU TWO MAKE MY LIFE
A LIVING HELL.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.567
HA HA. GREAT,
GREAT PARTY, RACHEL.

19:53.567 --> 19:54.500
WE'RE HAVING A GREAT TIME.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.600
REALLY?

19:55.600 --> 19:56.900
WOW, I THOUGHT THAT
WHOLE HONESTY GAME

19:56.900 --> 19:58.100
MIGHT HAVE RUINED
THE EVENING.

19:58.100 --> 19:59.934
AH, ON THE CONTRARY,

19:59.934 --> 20:01.200
HONESTY IS THE
ONLY WAY TO GO

20:01.200 --> 20:02.667
FOR A HEALTHY
RELATIONSHIP.

20:02.667 --> 20:05.834
IF YOU'LL NOTICE,
ONLY THE HONEST COUPLES
ARE LEFT HERE.

20:05.834 --> 20:08.200
YEAH, THE BULLET HURT.

20:08.200 --> 20:09.967
BUT I SAVED
THE PRESIDENT'S LIFE,

20:09.967 --> 20:11.667
SO I THINK
IT WAS WORTH IT.

20:13.100 --> 20:15.500
ERIC DOESN'T COUNT.

20:15.500 --> 20:19.500
AND...I'M BATMAN.

20:33.834 --> 20:34.967
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:34.967 --> 20:36.200
OH, I LEFT MINE
IN MY GYM BAG.

20:36.200 --> 20:39.867
YOU KNOW,
THIS SHARING STUFF
IS GREAT. THANKS.

20:39.867 --> 20:42.233
BLECCH, THERE'S
A HAIR ON IT.

20:42.233 --> 20:45.667
OH, YEAH. LOOK,
IT'S ONE OF MY BOYS.

20:45.667 --> 20:49.000
I CAN TELL 'CAUSE
IT'S KINKY, LIKE ME.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.400
HERE YA GO.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.834
YOU ARE A DISGUSTING
LITTLE MAN.

20:52.834 --> 20:55.000
YES, I AM.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.767
HEY, SHAWN, WHY ARE
YOU FOLLOWING ME?

20:57.767 --> 20:59.567
YOU HAD
YOUR CHANCE, BABE.

20:59.567 --> 21:01.200
I'M NOT
FOLLOWING YOU.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.133
I COULDN'T CARE LESS
ABOUT YOU.

21:03.133 --> 21:04.600
YOU MEAN NOTHING
TO ME.

21:04.600 --> 21:05.667
LESS THAN NOTHING.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.133
NOTHING. NOT A THING.

21:16.133 --> 21:18.967
OK. GOOD FOR YOU.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.133
COLD SHOWER NOW!
