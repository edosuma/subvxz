you can just get it out and
you can slide it under the door

01:44.255 --> 01:46.163

Mom, mom?

02:09.885 --> 02:13.913
Mom, you don't understand, okay?

02:13.955 --> 02:16.403
If you don't gimme this money, I'm in real trouble,

02:16.445 --> 02:19.043
some people are gonna come
get me because I owe them this,

02:19.085 --> 02:20.033

02:20.075 --> 02:21.053
they're gonna fucking kill me.

Oh, shit, if you were gonna gimme the money all along,

05:04.595 --> 05:06.833
you should have just done it in the first place

05:06.875 --> 05:09.248
instead of making me all riled up.

05:09.290 --> 05:10.081
(laughing cunningly)

05:10.123 --> 05:12.623
You want me to fucking suffer, you do.

07:28.929 --> 07:30.096
- You're back.

07:31.428 --> 07:32.348
- I never left.

07:35.075 --> 07:37.703
- I had the wildest dream last night,

07:37.745 --> 07:39.083
we were both ice skating on this lake,

07:39.125 --> 07:40.763
except we didn't have skates on,

07:40.805 --> 07:43.553
we were just gliding around in our socks.

07:43.595 --> 07:47.033
You grabbed my hand, we skated as fast as we could.

07:47.075 --> 07:49.763
Ugh, then some boys totally shot life out of us,

07:49.805 --> 07:51.908
we died laughing like maniacs.

07:53.015 --> 07:56.063
Then something fell from the sky and crashed the ice,

07:56.105 --> 07:59.633
like a meteor or an asteroid,

07:59.675 --> 08:03.023
what's the difference between
a meteor and an asteroid?

08:03.065 --> 08:04.478
- I have no fucking idea.

08:05.825 --> 08:09.173
- Anyway, yeah, everyone was sliding into the water,

08:09.215 --> 08:13.193
men, women, I mean, the little kids,

08:13.235 --> 08:14.723
and shit was black like oil

08:14.765 --> 08:17.573
and you could see the cold hovering over it,

08:17.615 --> 08:19.418
like spirits rising from hell.

08:20.705 --> 08:21.923
There was this one older woman

08:21.965 --> 08:23.633
and she was holding on for dear life

08:23.675 --> 08:25.823
and I could feel her hopelessness

08:25.865 --> 08:28.478
as if I was the one who was about to die.

08:33.905 --> 08:34.738
That feels nice.

08:38.225 --> 08:39.398
- Then what happened?

08:40.595 --> 08:44.873
- She smiled like she'd accepted
her life was already over,

08:44.915 --> 08:49.915
and I don't know, I smiled back and she just let go.

08:51.473 --> 08:53.258
It was fucking beautiful.

08:55.295 --> 08:57.875
- Only you would think that's beautiful.

09:00.402 --> 09:01.913
What's this?

09:01.955 --> 09:03.405
- All the energies around us,

09:04.325 --> 09:07.283
pulsating war tags with
everything and nothingness

09:07.325 --> 09:08.378
all at once.

09:12.168 --> 09:13.298
- Yeah, I see that.

09:14.885 --> 09:17.078
- She's high, barely started.

09:18.455 --> 09:21.541
- See, it's fucking incredible.

09:21.583 --> 09:22.631
- Thank you.

09:22.673 --> 09:25.840
(bright upbeat music)

09:30.307 --> 09:33.383
- Sorry, no, I have a rule.

09:33.425 --> 09:34.258
- Don't be.

09:38.615 --> 09:39.773
- You mean it?

09:39.815 --> 09:41.018
- Yeah.

09:43.435 --> 09:46.102
(air whooshing)

09:53.345 --> 09:54.695
What do you think it meant?

09:56.004 --> 09:57.222
- What?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.181
- My dream.

10:01.035 --> 10:02.468
- Don't go skating.

10:03.485 --> 10:04.318
- Funny.

10:05.315 --> 10:06.929
- It wasn't a joke.

10:06.971 --> 10:10.138
(bright upbeat music)

10:20.364 --> 10:23.799
(sniffling loudly)

10:23.841 --> 10:27.008
(bright upbeat music)

10:57.114 --> 10:59.813
Hey, party for going back to the doctor today.

10:59.855 --> 11:00.728
- Thanks.

11:03.605 --> 11:05.155
Hey, did we hook up last night?

11:06.065 --> 11:07.493
I don't know, I was so fucked up,

11:07.535 --> 11:10.163
I don't know if it was a dream or not.

11:10.205 --> 11:11.705
- That was definitely a dream.

11:13.835 --> 11:15.063
- Cool.

11:15.105 --> 11:17.633
- How was I though in the dream?

11:17.675 --> 11:18.728
- Fantastic.

11:19.685 --> 11:21.135
- That's what I like to hear.

11:23.075 --> 11:24.098
How do I look?

11:25.115 --> 11:26.873
- You look sexy as fuck.

11:26.915 --> 11:29.228
- Let's hope, I really need this gig,

11:31.085 --> 11:33.852
shit, I gotta go, catch you later though?

11:35.744 --> 11:38.411
(feet stomping)

11:40.734 --> 11:43.901
(bright upbeat music)

12:23.045 --> 12:24.219
Hey you.

12:24.261 --> 12:27.428
(bright upbeat music)

12:49.085 --> 12:51.473
What are you waiting for?

12:51.515 --> 12:56.515
Come on, don't be scared, this is right for you, I promise.

13:01.804 --> 13:04.971
(bright upbeat music)

13:20.855 --> 13:22.913
- You were with Benjamin Harris

13:22.955 --> 13:26.198
and he diagnosed you with BPD.

13:27.695 --> 13:29.078
- Yep, when I was 18.

13:30.095 --> 13:34.745
- I see, he prescribed you Lamictal 100 milligrams

13:35.765 --> 13:40.028
twice a day, and Haloperidol,
five milligrams twice a day.

13:40.865 --> 13:41.828
- And Lexapro.

13:44.159 --> 13:46.853
(scribbling on paper)

13:46.895 --> 13:48.245
- Did that medication help?

13:49.415 --> 13:53.453
- It made me feel kinda sick, like violently ill.

13:53.495 --> 13:55.045
- I'll prescribe an anti-nausea.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.003
- Cool.

13:59.045 --> 14:02.978
- You were hospitalized October 3rd of last year?

14:04.415 --> 14:05.248
- Yep.

14:08.615 --> 14:09.448
- What for?

14:11.105 --> 14:12.605
- I mean, you can read, right?

14:13.595 --> 14:15.195
- I just wanna hear it from you.

14:16.137 --> 14:18.428
- It was an overdose, fentanyl.

14:19.895 --> 14:21.413
- Are you still taking fentanyl?

14:21.455 --> 14:22.288
- Nope.

14:24.485 --> 14:26.963
- Any other drug use, marijuana?

14:27.005 --> 14:27.796
- Nope.

14:27.838 --> 14:29.423
- Opiates? - Nope.

14:29.465 --> 14:30.665
- Amphetamines? - Nope.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.783
- Any family history of mental illness?

14:35.825 --> 14:37.733
- None that have been diagnosed.

14:37.775 --> 14:41.501
- Any thoughts of suicide or self-harm behaviors?

14:41.543 --> 14:43.958
- No, I used to, not anymore.

14:45.035 --> 14:48.908
- All right, well, I wanna see you back in a month,

14:49.805 --> 14:52.613
my secretary can schedule that for you,

14:52.655 --> 14:57.045
and also have her call in these prescriptions

14:58.655 --> 14:59.963
at your pharmacy, okay?

15:00.005 --> 15:03.143
Op, (chuckling playfully)

15:03.185 --> 15:04.793
you have a good day.

15:04.835 --> 15:07.373
Call me if you need me, okay?

15:07.415 --> 15:08.378
You have my number.

15:09.593 --> 15:12.343
(paper rustling)

15:18.117 --> 15:19.688
Yeah, what time is lunch?

15:21.485 --> 15:25.318
- One, two, three, four.

15:25.360 --> 15:26.813
(bright upbeat music)

15:26.855 --> 15:28.191
No big deal.

15:28.233 --> 15:31.400
(bright upbeat music)

15:40.892 --> 15:43.523
(door hinges squeaking)

15:43.565 --> 15:44.898
Kitty, hi kitty.

15:48.773 --> 15:50.229
I got your food.

15:50.271 --> 15:53.438
(bright upbeat music)

15:58.544 --> 16:01.877
(door hinges squeaking)

16:03.015 --> 16:06.098
(kicking carelessly)

16:06.996 --> 16:10.163
(bright upbeat music)

17:13.188 --> 17:14.273
Hey.

17:14.315 --> 17:16.043
- Sorry I'm late, Mark is obsessing (murmurs)

17:16.085 --> 17:18.413
I had to hang this one piece for like two hours.

17:18.455 --> 17:20.423
Probably moved that shit more than two dozen times.

17:20.465 --> 17:21.893
- That'll be you one day.

17:21.935 --> 17:23.843
- Yeah, if I ever get a showing,

17:23.885 --> 17:27.533
I want my work scattered everywhere, walls, floor,

17:27.575 --> 17:29.573
fuck it, ceiling.

17:29.615 --> 17:31.973
- Not if you get a showing, when.

17:32.015 --> 17:35.468
- Yeah, how was the shrink today?

17:38.015 --> 17:40.733
- It was fine, they just put me on more meds.

17:40.775 --> 17:43.575
- Never really told me what it was like, your condition.

17:45.485 --> 17:48.413
- I guess it's like hard to describe,

17:48.455 --> 17:53.455
I mean, it's just like my feelings, you know?

17:54.305 --> 17:56.573
Like I don't know if things are real sometimes,

17:56.615 --> 17:57.957
if that makes sense.

17:57.999 --> 17:59.903
- I dunno if it was schizophrenic,

17:59.945 --> 18:02.213
but would seem monstrous when she was off her meds.

18:02.255 --> 18:04.553
- Yeah, I guess borderline is just not really like that

18:04.595 --> 18:07.973
for me, I guess like the easiest way to describe,

18:08.015 --> 18:11.273
it's like I think people are
lying to me like all the time.

18:11.315 --> 18:12.713
Like they'll tell me something sometimes,

18:12.755 --> 18:15.833
and I'll be like, no, they're faking, they're faking,

18:15.875 --> 18:16.928
like they have to be.

18:19.512 --> 18:23.063
And then like what I think like doesn't line up

18:23.105 --> 18:25.043
with reality, I guess, but sometimes it does,

18:25.085 --> 18:29.183
so I don't know, and then like I'll think of things

18:29.225 --> 18:32.663
and I'll remember them like
they were actual memories,

18:32.705 --> 18:34.643
but I guess sometimes they weren't

18:34.685 --> 18:37.808
and that scares me and other people.

18:38.855 --> 18:40.643
- But the meds help?

18:40.685 --> 18:42.473
- No, not really.

18:42.515 --> 18:44.453
I mean, I guess sometimes,

18:44.495 --> 18:49.373
but you just have like so many side effects

18:49.415 --> 18:52.343
and like negative shit that it's not worth it.

18:52.385 --> 18:54.643
- Well, happy you're giving them a try.

18:54.685 --> 18:57.683
Charli, you really scared me a few days ago,

18:57.725 --> 18:59.513
the things you were saying,

18:59.555 --> 19:01.348
you know how much I care about you, right?

19:02.510 --> 19:03.760
- Yeah, I know.

19:05.088 --> 19:06.923
- All right, let's get outta here.

19:06.965 --> 19:10.643
Mark told me about some crazy party, check it out,

19:10.685 --> 19:11.585
step out to Molly.

19:12.575 --> 19:13.943
- You got me on Molly, let's go.

19:13.985 --> 19:14.835
- Let me call in.

19:16.422 --> 19:17.213
Watch out.

19:17.255 --> 19:19.922
(feet stomping)

19:26.242 --> 19:27.593
(loud banging)

19:27.635 --> 19:28.463
- One second.

19:28.505 --> 19:30.443
- [Man] You've been in there like 10 minutes.

19:30.485 --> 19:32.108
- I said one second, fuck you.

19:34.818 --> 19:37.735
(sniffling loudly)

19:41.838 --> 19:45.614
Ugh, God.

19:45.656 --> 19:47.005
(banging loudly)

19:47.047 --> 19:48.755
- [Man] Hurry up.

19:48.797 --> 19:50.106
(banging loudly)

19:50.148 --> 19:51.237
- Hey, bitch.

19:51.279 --> 19:54.446
(bright upbeat music)

20:06.608 --> 20:10.103
Good morning, Ms. Monica, time for your meds.

20:10.145 --> 20:10.936
- You're an angel.

20:10.978 --> 20:12.931
- Oh no, please.

20:12.973 --> 20:15.593
Do you need anything else?

20:15.635 --> 20:17.843
- Only for these pills to kick in.

20:17.885 --> 20:18.735
- They will soon.

20:20.075 --> 20:21.675
Doctor will be with you shortly,

20:22.655 --> 20:24.503
I'll be back at two for your next dose.

20:24.545 --> 20:27.454
- If you wanna come any sooner that's more than okay.

20:27.496 --> 20:30.663
(bright upbeat music)

20:33.545 --> 20:34.643
- Yeah, it's what I told them.

20:34.685 --> 20:36.233
I said I've been coming here for years,

20:36.275 --> 20:37.958
since when cigars been an issue?

20:41.195 --> 20:42.708
You're God damn right with it.

20:44.345 --> 20:45.278
Shut the door.

20:49.565 --> 20:53.243
Bobby, yeah, I gotta go, we're still on for Friday?

20:53.285 --> 20:54.118
Perfect.

21:00.215 --> 21:03.878
I like your makeup today, that color suits you.

21:06.515 --> 21:09.773
I talked to Susan, she won't be a problem anymore.

21:09.815 --> 21:11.865
Just avoid her for a few days if you can.

21:12.875 --> 21:13.838
- I appreciate it.

21:17.465 --> 21:18.934
- Sit.

21:18.976 --> 21:22.143
(bright upbeat music)

21:24.250 --> 21:27.167
(jiggling tablets)

21:29.615 --> 21:30.765
Any plans this weekend?

21:32.162 --> 21:34.760
- Just working.

21:34.802 --> 21:37.088
- It's too bad, I was gonna invite you over for dinner.

21:37.130 --> 21:40.297
(bright upbeat music)

22:45.725 --> 22:47.693
Check your schedule and find
a night for you to come over

22:47.735 --> 22:48.568
for that dinner.

22:50.735 --> 22:51.696
- Okay.

22:51.738 --> 22:54.905
(bright upbeat music)

23:06.215 --> 23:07.973
- So what's on the menu this evening?

23:08.015 --> 23:09.413
- I'm glad you asked.

23:09.455 --> 23:11.483
Tonight we had some of the finest pharmaceuticals

23:11.525 --> 23:14.243
on the market, all the dishes
are meant to be shareable,

23:14.285 --> 23:15.076
by the way.

23:15.118 --> 23:19.763
- Oh no, I'm afraid I'm by myself, care to join me?

23:19.805 --> 23:21.233
What time do you get off?

23:21.275 --> 23:23.543
- Me, I get off at seven.

23:23.585 --> 23:25.013
- Would you join me then?

23:25.055 --> 23:27.218
I do so hate dining alone.

23:28.685 --> 23:30.878
- With you, it would be my pleasure.

23:32.225 --> 23:33.833
- Shouldn't the chef be doing that?

23:33.875 --> 23:35.813
- This is a family establishment,

23:35.855 --> 23:38.183
I am both the chef and the server.

23:38.225 --> 23:39.863
- Interesting.

23:39.905 --> 23:42.056
- May I please have your plate.

23:42.098 --> 23:43.533
- Of course.

23:43.575 --> 23:45.023
- Thank you, Miss.

23:45.065 --> 23:46.718
- It's Zee.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.308
- Zee, lovely to meet you.

23:49.265 --> 23:52.613
Oh, I see you don't have any utensils,

23:52.655 --> 23:54.683
I'm gonna have to fire that bus boy.

23:54.725 --> 23:55.844
I'll be right back.

23:55.886 --> 23:59.053
(bright upbeat music)

24:01.539 --> 24:02.990
Here you go.

24:03.032 --> 24:04.913
- Ah, such excellent service,

24:04.955 --> 24:07.073
I'll give you a five star Yelp review.

24:07.115 --> 24:09.519
- That's much appreciated, thank you.

24:09.561 --> 24:12.473
(sniffling loudly)

24:12.515 --> 24:13.665
- You have to try this.

24:16.970 --> 24:20.453
(sniffling loudly)

24:20.495 --> 24:23.213
Hey, cool after our spot.

24:23.255 --> 24:24.503
You wanna check it out?

24:24.545 --> 24:26.033
- Now you're talking, let's go.

25:16.565 --> 25:18.440
- On a Saturday?

25:18.482 --> 25:19.778
- It could be fun.

25:23.435 --> 25:24.713
- You'd make a killing.

25:24.755 --> 25:28.088

25:37.118 --> 25:39.623
They like puppies or flowers, not what I do.

25:39.665 --> 25:41.363
- Okay, paint a poodle then.

25:41.405 --> 25:42.983
- Art's the only thing that makes me feel alive,

25:43.025 --> 25:44.003
they paint for someone else,

25:44.045 --> 25:46.883
it'd blow my fucking brains out.

25:46.925 --> 25:48.113

Charli, bad idea, you know we can't do that.

26:17.255 --> 26:18.088
- Why?

26:19.008 --> 26:21.353
- It'll ruin our friendship and you have a boyfriend.

26:21.395 --> 26:22.673
- Kyle is not my boyfriend.

26:22.715 --> 26:23.843

26:27.659 --> 26:29.211
(bright upbeat music)

26:29.253 --> 26:30.337
I'm sorry.

26:30.379 --> 26:31.429
- No, I'm sorry.

26:31.471 --> 26:32.633
- No.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.373
- No, I'm just, my meds got me really fucked up

26:34.415 --> 26:35.353
in the head right now.

26:35.395 --> 26:36.713
- I thought they were supposed to untwist you.

26:36.755 --> 26:38.273
- Yeah, I thought so too.

26:38.315 --> 26:40.193
I'm just gonna stop taking them so it's...

26:40.235 --> 26:41.483
- No, you can't...

26:41.525 --> 26:45.216
Look, you're my best friend in the whole world,

26:45.258 --> 26:47.535
I love you way too much to let you, okay?

26:47.577 --> 26:48.410

27:34.552 --> 27:38.678
- Mark's having a meltdown, he wrote me a whole novel.

27:40.145 --> 27:41.553
I gotta go.

27:41.595 --> 27:44.762
(bright upbeat music)

27:48.215 --> 27:51.323
- Hey, sorry I tried to kiss you last night.

27:51.365 --> 27:52.493
- You did?

27:52.535 --> 27:54.285
If I can remember, I was so wasted.

27:58.121 --> 28:00.052
Don't forget to take your meds today, okay?

28:00.094 --> 28:01.703
Don't have to have you committed?

28:01.745 --> 28:02.939
- Yes, mom.

28:02.981 --> 28:04.568
- Don't feel bad about me.

28:10.025 --> 28:11.368
Oh, I'll see you later.

28:23.615 --> 28:24.565
- What do you mean?

28:26.585 --> 28:27.600
- You'll see.

28:27.642 --> 28:30.809
(bright upbeat music)

28:34.505 --> 28:36.382
Open your eyes, Charli.

28:36.424 --> 28:39.591
(bright upbeat music)

29:46.755 --> 29:48.623
- I was telling Erica about that show we went to

29:48.665 --> 29:52.118
the other night, the one
with the singer that you liked,

29:53.225 --> 29:58.225
but anyway, I accidentally called you my girlfriend,

30:02.135 --> 30:05.048
but then I thought like, what do I call you

30:05.090 --> 30:07.403
like if I were to introduce you to someone?

30:07.445 --> 30:10.130
- You'd say, "This is Charli."

30:10.172 --> 30:11.802
- But that's weird, don't you think?

30:11.844 --> 30:12.635
- Why is it weird?

30:12.677 --> 30:13.523
You think my name is weird?

30:13.565 --> 30:16.818
- Baby, I like your name, but what are we?

30:18.346 --> 30:21.263
(chuckling loudly)

30:22.775 --> 30:24.608
- Could we stop, okay?

30:27.261 --> 30:28.052
- Charli, what are we?

30:28.094 --> 30:29.888
- What, why are you asking me this?

30:32.555 --> 30:34.493
Can we just not do this, please?

30:34.535 --> 30:35.573
- That's just how it is.

30:35.615 --> 30:37.613
- No, it's not how it is, it's not how it is.

30:37.655 --> 30:40.073
- I mean, I'm not seeing anyone else, sorry, are you?

30:40.115 --> 30:41.136
- No, but that's not the point.

30:41.178 --> 30:43.253
- Okay, then what is the issue?

30:43.295 --> 30:45.045
Unless you wanna see somebody else.

30:46.595 --> 30:51.308
- I don't, but please, can we please not do this.

30:53.225 --> 30:54.225
- Whatever you need.

31:08.471 --> 31:09.413
- We gotta go.

31:09.455 --> 31:11.108
Come on, get up, we gotta go.

31:11.975 --> 31:14.041
- Sure, whatever.

31:14.083 --> 31:17.166
(car engine running)

31:19.955 --> 31:21.278
All right, we're here.

31:22.415 --> 31:24.413
- Why can't I go in with you?

31:24.455 --> 31:27.263
- Sarah just gets kinda freaked out around new people.

31:27.305 --> 31:29.153
- You think she's gonna be scared of me?

31:29.195 --> 31:32.873
- Trust me, she's unhinged
and the people that she sells to,

31:32.915 --> 31:34.913
also unhinged.

31:34.955 --> 31:38.183
Just, you don't know who may be in there right now.

31:38.225 --> 31:39.248
- Okay, fine.

31:41.398 --> 31:43.168
- You know I'm only doing this for you, right?

31:44.045 --> 31:45.045
- Yeah, I know.

31:46.071 --> 31:48.988
(smooching loudly)

31:51.256 --> 31:53.080
(car door closing)

31:53.122 --> 31:56.289
(bright upbeat music)

32:13.491 --> 32:15.832
(loud notification)

32:15.874 --> 32:19.041
(bright upbeat music)

32:21.359 --> 32:24.359
(loud notification)

32:26.465 --> 32:27.557
You got it?

32:27.599 --> 32:30.182
(door closing)

32:35.098 --> 32:37.026
(car engine starting)

32:37.068 --> 32:38.903
- This shit is nasty as hell.

32:38.945 --> 32:41.315
- It gets the job done though.

32:41.357 --> 32:43.088
- Oh, uh-uh, I need tequila.

32:44.405 --> 32:45.196
- Yeah, that is better.

32:45.238 --> 32:47.153
- Dinner is here, woo.

32:47.195 --> 32:49.793
- Courtesy of Kyle's mysterious hookup.

32:49.835 --> 32:51.458
- Give me that.

32:52.772 --> 32:54.503
(sniffling loudly)

32:54.545 --> 32:57.923
Fresh outta the oven just like I like it, you first.

32:57.965 --> 32:59.423
- No, thank you.

32:59.465 --> 33:01.223
- Okay, your loss.

33:01.265 --> 33:02.753
- Kyle doesn't do that shit,

33:02.795 --> 33:05.453
but he does know every single
dealer in town somehow, so...

33:05.495 --> 33:07.013
- What can I say?

33:07.055 --> 33:08.573
I'm popular.

33:08.615 --> 33:10.373
- And the perfect boyfriend,

33:10.415 --> 33:12.443
you go to some scary ass crack den to square your girl

33:12.485 --> 33:15.563
and her bestie some drugs, you (murmurs) yourself,

33:15.605 --> 33:17.843
this says chivalry dead, come on.

33:17.885 --> 33:20.093
- Luckily I didn't have to go in any crack den this time.

33:20.135 --> 33:23.153
- You would though, I see in your eyes.

33:23.195 --> 33:25.283
You better lock him down
before someone snatches him up,

33:25.325 --> 33:26.933
come on.

33:26.975 --> 33:28.073
How much money do you make?

33:28.115 --> 33:28.973
- What?

33:29.015 --> 33:32.213
- I'm kidding, but if I weren't, how much?

33:32.255 --> 33:35.213
- No, he's literally broke just like us.

33:35.255 --> 33:36.503
- I'm not broke.

33:36.545 --> 33:37.403
- Hey, don't be mean to our guests,

33:37.445 --> 33:40.553
I want him coming back for the drugs,

33:40.595 --> 33:42.293
I'm not trying to steal him or anything.

33:42.335 --> 33:43.763
- That's comforting.

33:43.805 --> 33:46.282
- Relax, I'm just fucking with you.

33:46.324 --> 33:47.115
(sniffling loudly)

33:47.157 --> 33:49.343
- Oh, you're stopping, Zee, gimme some.

33:49.385 --> 33:51.135
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:51.177 --> 33:52.823
You don't know what you're missing.

33:52.865 --> 33:55.643
I feel like I'm fucking underwater right now.

33:55.685 --> 33:57.263
- [Kyle] And that's supposed to be a good thing?

33:57.305 --> 33:58.120
- You don't understand,

33:58.162 --> 34:01.718
I feel like I'm getting real, real slow.

34:03.335 --> 34:04.838
Baby, come here and snuggle.

34:05.871 --> 34:07.013
- I'm kinda comfy right here.

34:07.055 --> 34:09.171
- Don't be like that.

34:09.213 --> 34:11.880
(feet stomping)

34:12.995 --> 34:14.753
- You're okay, baby?

34:14.795 --> 34:15.992
- Yeah, I'm fine.

34:16.986 --> 34:19.868
- Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick.

34:31.077 --> 34:33.744
(air whooshing)

34:40.939 --> 34:43.696
- You know nothing lasts forever, right?

34:43.738 --> 34:45.683
We just burn it all down.

34:45.725 --> 34:47.201
We then can we start again?

34:47.243 --> 34:50.410
(bright upbeat music)

35:07.803 --> 35:09.832
(air whooshing)

35:09.874 --> 35:13.041
(bright upbeat music)

35:15.815 --> 35:17.505
Open your eyes, Charli.

35:18.626 --> 35:21.793
(bright upbeat music)

35:33.832 --> 35:34.988
You're okay?

35:36.845 --> 35:39.383
- I don't know how I feel right now.

35:39.425 --> 35:41.081
- You can get used to it, it's okay.

35:41.123 --> 35:42.767
- Well, it's just...

35:42.809 --> 35:43.913
- What the fuck are you doing?

35:43.955 --> 35:44.888
- You're awake.

35:46.355 --> 35:47.613
- I fucking knew it.

35:47.655 --> 35:48.745
- Charli, wait.

35:48.787 --> 35:49.620
- Charli.

35:52.176 --> 35:53.621
(knocking loudly)

35:53.663 --> 35:55.742
- [Zee] Charli, we were just talking.

35:55.784 --> 35:58.206
- Shut the fuck up, go away, leave me the fuck alone.

35:58.248 --> 36:01.843
Why are you always doing shit like this to me, why?

36:01.885 --> 36:03.125
Fuck you.

36:03.167 --> 36:04.449
- [Zee] Come out here so we can explain.

36:04.491 --> 36:06.404
- No, leave me the fuck alone, okay?

36:06.446 --> 36:09.545
Leave me alone, leave me the fuck alone.

36:09.587 --> 36:11.453
- [Zee] Charli, please, we
were talking about you actually,

36:11.495 --> 36:13.583
told me he cared about you.

36:13.625 --> 36:17.088
- Go away, and you fucking understand me, go away.

36:18.138 --> 36:21.388
- [Zee] It's not your fault, we care about you anyway.

36:21.430 --> 36:26.430
(crying bitterly) (bright upbeat music)

37:18.338 --> 37:20.195
(air whooshing)

37:20.237 --> 37:24.506
It's all your fault, you know, if you end it all?

37:24.548 --> 37:25.805
- Zee, wait, Zee?

37:27.638 --> 37:29.514
(bright upbeat music)

37:29.556 --> 37:31.416
- You gotta keep up, okay?

37:31.458 --> 37:34.625
(bright upbeat music)

37:42.995 --> 37:44.108
- Zee, wake up.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.083
- What time is it?

37:47.125 --> 37:48.443
- Late, I don't know.

37:48.485 --> 37:49.318
- Where's Kyle?

37:52.565 --> 37:54.113
- I don't know, but that is not my problem.

37:54.155 --> 37:56.508
- Oh, sure, I need to back down.

38:02.252 --> 38:05.419
(suspenseful upbeats)

38:17.240 --> 38:18.863
Oh my God, if Charli didn't walk in,

38:18.905 --> 38:20.766
I would've been all over you.

38:20.808 --> 38:22.108
I gotta go, text me later.

38:23.015 --> 38:26.182
(bright upbeat music)

38:30.245 --> 38:32.611
- Who were you talking to?

38:32.653 --> 38:34.313
Who were you talking to on the phone?

38:34.355 --> 38:35.146
- No, I wasn't talking to anyone,

38:35.188 --> 38:36.788
my phone's right here, see?

38:38.315 --> 38:39.383
I gotta run errands though,

38:39.425 --> 38:42.028
we should do something later
tonight though, just us, okay?

38:43.713 --> 38:46.880
(suspenseful upbeats)

38:52.679 --> 38:55.596
(swings squeaking)

39:00.509 --> 39:02.943
I'm trying to think of...

39:02.985 --> 39:06.985
(girls chattering and giggling)

39:21.948 --> 39:25.115
(bright upbeat music)

39:29.155 --> 39:31.073
Do you like your therapist?

39:31.115 --> 39:33.083
- Not really, why?

39:33.125 --> 39:34.853
- I don't know, I'm about starting again,

39:34.895 --> 39:36.203
I haven't been since I was like 10

39:36.245 --> 39:38.456
but all we did then was play Scrabble and Mousetrap.

39:38.498 --> 39:40.193
That was my favorite though, I kinda liked it.

39:40.235 --> 39:42.323
- Mousetrap was your favorite?

39:42.365 --> 39:43.463
- Yeah, I don't know,

39:43.505 --> 39:46.223
it's more than rolling dice and moving pieces.

39:46.265 --> 39:49.313
Okay, you still do that but
there's this elaborate trap

39:49.355 --> 39:50.153
and if you get in the right spot,

39:50.195 --> 39:52.463
you drop ball down and shoot, some crazy shit happens

39:52.505 --> 39:53.963
and you catch your opponent.

39:54.005 --> 39:56.093
- Yeah, but you spend like an hour setting it up

39:56.135 --> 39:58.193
to play for like 10 minutes.

39:58.235 --> 40:00.623
- It's a game, that's why you play it, it kills time.

40:00.665 --> 40:02.423
You are so cynical.

40:02.465 --> 40:05.303
- It's not a game to me, that's my fucking life.

40:05.345 --> 40:06.295
- What do you mean?

40:07.295 --> 40:11.363
- Okay, you know, you spend like all this time

40:11.405 --> 40:13.583
setting up traps to make things turn out

40:13.625 --> 40:15.563
the way you want them to,

40:15.605 --> 40:18.233
but then in the end they
don't actually turn out that way,

40:18.275 --> 40:21.143
they turn out in like this even worse way,

40:21.185 --> 40:22.073
that puts you in a worse place

40:22.115 --> 40:23.183
than anywhere when you just started

40:23.225 --> 40:24.728
and it sucks for everyone.

40:26.015 --> 40:26.848
- I feel you.

40:32.458 --> 40:34.613
Why do married men like to cuddle so much?

40:34.655 --> 40:36.703
- Zee, what the fuck are you talking about?

40:36.745 --> 40:37.853
- I don't know, I met this guy on Tinder

40:37.895 --> 40:40.586
and all he wants to do is watch me jerk off and cuddle.

40:40.628 --> 40:41.483
- Ew. - I know, right?

40:41.525 --> 40:45.203
Like cuddling is so intimate, do that with your wife.

40:45.245 --> 40:46.223
Can give a fuck that's on the table,

40:46.265 --> 40:48.683
you think a snuggle would be...

40:48.725 --> 40:50.063
- I think if you're with someone long enough,

40:50.105 --> 40:51.805
you're bound to start hating them.

40:52.865 --> 40:54.015
- Not us though, right?

40:55.025 --> 40:56.753
- I don't think you'll be in this earth long enough

40:56.795 --> 40:58.193
to ever hate you.

40:58.235 --> 41:03.235
- Cold, don't say shit like that, okay?

41:03.545 --> 41:04.378
- Say what?

41:05.855 --> 41:07.264
- You know.

41:07.306 --> 41:10.473
(bright upbeat music)

41:17.375 --> 41:18.983
- Hey, Zee, wake up.

41:19.025 --> 41:20.348
- Yeah, why?

41:22.408 --> 41:23.918
- I could never hate you.

41:24.785 --> 41:27.698
- I know, why?

41:29.675 --> 41:31.980
- If I asked you to run away with me, would you?

41:32.022 --> 41:33.713
- You watch too many movies.

41:33.755 --> 41:35.303
- No, I'm serious.

41:35.345 --> 41:39.473
Look, we could get in the car
and we could just drive, okay?

41:39.515 --> 41:43.043
We could drive to a new city where nobody knows us,

41:43.085 --> 41:45.233
and then we could be anyone we wanted to be.

41:45.275 --> 41:48.473
We could just, I don't know.

41:48.515 --> 41:49.965
- Yeah, but who would you be?

41:51.185 --> 41:54.398
- I haven't thought that far ahead, anyone, anyone else.

41:56.765 --> 41:57.556
- You can do that for a little,

41:57.598 --> 41:59.903
but you just become yourself again, Charli.

41:59.945 --> 42:01.523
- I don't think so.

42:01.565 --> 42:03.713
I mean, okay, if you think about it,

42:03.755 --> 42:05.873
like what you are is just your perception

42:05.915 --> 42:07.073
of what you are, right?

42:07.115 --> 42:08.120
And so you think you know who you are

42:08.162 --> 42:09.653
and so you're just playing that part,

42:09.695 --> 42:11.663
and so if you just choose something different,

42:11.705 --> 42:14.605
then you can pretend and
then you'll be different forever.

42:16.025 --> 42:17.048
- I like who I am.

42:18.335 --> 42:19.793
- Yeah, but you always have

42:19.835 --> 42:22.313
a little bit of you in you, right?

42:22.355 --> 42:24.743
- Well, if that's true, then you never really disappear,

42:24.785 --> 42:27.593
you're just pretending, do you
go back to the same bullshit?

42:27.635 --> 42:30.818
I mean, for true ego death, you need to erase it all.

42:31.771 --> 42:33.323
You can't just scrape away trauma though,

42:33.365 --> 42:36.008
I mean, that's what makes you you.

42:37.175 --> 42:39.203
Let's be real, all the drugs
in the universe, can't wipe out

42:39.245 --> 42:41.558
what's ingrained in your subconscious, Charli.

42:42.965 --> 42:44.753
- Yeah, tell me about it.

42:44.795 --> 42:46.613
- I mean, it's a nice thought though,

42:46.655 --> 42:49.709
maybe one day we'll figure it out, not tonight.

42:49.751 --> 42:52.918
(bright upbeat music)

43:00.549 --> 43:03.216
(phone ringing)

43:05.402 --> 43:06.235
- Hello?

43:09.290 --> 43:10.594
Yes, I know.

43:10.636 --> 43:11.776
(bright upbeat music)

43:11.818 --> 43:13.816
Yeah, I know that already, can you stop...?

43:13.858 --> 43:17.273
(bright upbeat music)

43:17.315 --> 43:22.073
No, okay, listen, I'm gonna pay it, okay?

43:22.115 --> 43:23.156
I'm gonna pay it.

43:23.198 --> 43:26.365
(bright upbeat music)

43:29.345 --> 43:30.245
I don't know.

43:30.287 --> 43:31.973
(bright upbeat music)

43:32.015 --> 43:34.148
No, please, please don't do that,

43:35.285 --> 43:38.277
please do not go to debt
collectors, I'm gonna pay it, okay?

43:38.319 --> 43:40.644
(bright upbeat music)

43:40.686 --> 43:43.583
I don't know, oh, okay, today,

43:43.625 --> 43:46.268
okay, sorry, today, I'm gonna pay it today.

43:47.615 --> 43:48.660
Yes.

43:48.702 --> 43:49.763
(bright upbeat music)

43:49.805 --> 43:51.225
Yes, I understand.

43:51.267 --> 43:54.263
(bright upbeat music)

43:54.305 --> 43:55.493
How much is it again?

43:55.535 --> 43:58.098
I mean, the lowest amount that I can do.

43:58.140 --> 44:01.307
(bright upbeat music)

44:02.562 --> 44:04.898
Yeah, I understand.

44:05.964 --> 44:09.131
(bright upbeat music)

44:11.180 --> 44:14.430
(whimpering worriedly)

44:28.595 --> 44:31.193
- I noticed you're off this Thursday,

44:31.235 --> 44:32.435
come by for that dinner.

44:33.395 --> 44:35.153
- No, I can't, I'm sorry.

44:35.195 --> 44:38.063
- Well, I'm gonna be traveling for the next month,

44:38.105 --> 44:41.105
which means it's your last
time to score for me for a while.

44:45.365 --> 44:47.840
Fine, I'll give you a double what I gave you

44:47.882 --> 44:49.478
the last time you came over.

44:50.675 --> 44:52.493
- Yeah, I can do that.

44:52.535 --> 44:55.088
- Perfect, come by at seven.

44:59.166 --> 45:01.036
(bright upbeat music)

45:01.078 --> 45:03.911
(crying bitterly)

45:08.731 --> 45:11.898
(bright upbeat music)

45:14.735 --> 45:16.485
- I am so fucking in love with you.

45:19.145 --> 45:19.936
Did you hear me?

45:19.978 --> 45:20.769
I just said...

45:20.811 --> 45:23.135
- Yeah, I heard what you said.

45:24.005 --> 45:25.978
- Okay, then how does that make you feel?

45:26.825 --> 45:29.303
- You don't love me, why would you say that?

45:29.345 --> 45:32.483
- Baby, I just, I love the way you make me feel.

45:32.525 --> 45:34.460
- You love what you think I am,

45:34.502 --> 45:37.823
you don't know me that well, honestly.

45:37.865 --> 45:39.743
Okay, but what's like one actual thing

45:39.785 --> 45:41.303
that you love about me?

45:41.345 --> 45:42.623
- I don't know, your smile.

45:42.665 --> 45:44.873
- Yeah, but I mean one actual
thing about my personality

45:44.915 --> 45:46.065
that you like about me.

45:47.315 --> 45:48.833
- You know what?

45:48.875 --> 45:50.025
Forget I said anything.

45:51.575 --> 45:52.425
- Look, I get it.

45:53.555 --> 45:58.555
Hey, love is just some temporary chemical imbalance

45:59.405 --> 46:03.353
and right now there are endorphins

46:03.395 --> 46:06.203
and Oxycontin flowing through your bloodstream

46:06.245 --> 46:10.523
because we're fucking, it's fun, it's cool, I have fun,

46:10.565 --> 46:14.183
but it's confusing you and that makes sense.

46:14.225 --> 46:16.793
It's gonna wear off, don't worry,

46:16.835 --> 46:18.285
and you'll be back to normal.

46:19.625 --> 46:22.298
- How did you get so fucking jaded?

46:23.945 --> 46:25.898
- You know, I'm gonna hurt you.

46:27.455 --> 46:28.733
- How do you know that?

46:28.775 --> 46:30.215
- That's just who I am.

46:32.125 --> 46:34.609
- Oh my God, that bartender's fucking adorable,

46:34.651 --> 46:36.188
I could eat him up.

46:40.434 --> 46:42.083
Did I miss something?

46:42.125 --> 46:43.463
- I gotta go.

46:43.505 --> 46:45.638
- Kyle, come on, don't be like that.

46:45.680 --> 46:46.471
- What happened?

46:46.513 --> 46:47.782
- Come on, stop.

46:47.824 --> 46:49.073
- Charli, what happened?

46:49.115 --> 46:51.236
- It's complicated, okay?

46:51.278 --> 46:52.069
- Okay.

46:52.111 --> 46:53.843
- It's none of your business, stop.

46:53.885 --> 46:56.273
- I wasn't trying to make it my business, I'm just worried.

46:56.315 --> 46:58.358
- You were, you were asking me, so...

46:58.400 --> 47:00.274
- Okay, I'll stay out of it.

47:00.316 --> 47:03.483

48:58.314 --> 49:00.314
- So how do you like it?

49:02.765 --> 49:03.598
- Huh?

49:04.715 --> 49:07.808
- Working at the hospital, do you enjoy it?

49:10.565 --> 49:11.708
- I wish it paid more.

49:13.535 --> 49:16.253
- You know, there's so many other ways

49:16.295 --> 49:17.945
for girls like you to make money.

49:25.145 --> 49:26.045
You're not eating.

49:26.975 --> 49:27.848
- I'm not hungry.

49:36.935 --> 49:38.868
- What do you think of the food?

49:45.056 --> 49:46.473
- It smells good.

49:48.335 --> 49:49.168
- Take a bite.

50:13.505 --> 50:14.338
That's good.

50:26.015 --> 50:26.918
Suck on it.

50:34.835 --> 50:35.828
You should model,

50:38.135 --> 50:42.173
I know a guy who can take
some real professional photos

50:42.215 --> 50:46.552
of you, but we can talk about that later though.

50:49.295 --> 50:50.528

52:57.052 --> 52:58.949
- Kyle, what are you doing here?

52:58.991 --> 53:02.628
- You told me to come by, you remember?

53:02.670 --> 53:04.520
- Oh shit, I did, fuck.

53:04.562 --> 53:06.548
I'm sorry, were you just here alone?

53:07.415 --> 53:08.248
- Zee was here.

53:09.557 --> 53:10.883
- Oh.

53:10.925 --> 53:13.163
- Do you mind if I crash a little bit longer?

53:13.205 --> 53:14.038
I'm beat.

53:15.749 --> 53:17.117
- Yeah, no problem.

53:17.159 --> 53:20.326
(bright upbeat music)

54:03.200 --> 54:07.283
- Yeah, we did a lot, (murmurs).

54:09.085 --> 54:11.393
- So what did you guys get into last week?

54:11.435 --> 54:12.593
- You wanna know?

54:12.635 --> 54:14.423
- [Kyle] Yeah, she said y'all had a blast last weekend.

54:14.465 --> 54:15.923
- We just went (murmurs), it wasn't too bad.

54:15.965 --> 54:17.843
- [Kyle] Oh crap, oh yeah, they were all last night,

54:17.885 --> 54:19.643
well, a couple nights ago too.

54:19.685 --> 54:21.391
- You should take her, she'll probably like it,

54:21.433 --> 54:22.224
I don't know.

54:22.266 --> 54:23.393
- [Kyle] She's mentioned it a couple of times.

54:23.435 --> 54:25.583
- Take her swimming, she'll like that.

54:25.625 --> 54:27.983
- I like to surf, so yeah, we can hit the water

54:28.025 --> 54:29.048
most definitely.

54:30.155 --> 54:32.138
- Hey, didn't you get in last night?

54:36.275 --> 54:37.558
- What are you doing here?

54:39.668 --> 54:41.633
- Good morning to you too.

54:41.675 --> 54:42.848
- It's fresh coffee.

54:45.082 --> 54:47.065
- I wish she wasn't so goofy.

54:47.107 --> 54:49.475
(chuckling annoyingly)

54:49.517 --> 54:50.767
- What's funny?

54:51.646 --> 54:52.896
- It's nothing.

54:55.925 --> 54:57.803
- Relax, he's telling me you're cranky

54:57.845 --> 54:59.966
before you've had your coffee, come on.

55:00.008 --> 55:01.426
- You need to leave.

55:01.468 --> 55:03.413
- Because I laughed at a joke.

55:03.455 --> 55:05.963
- No, because this is my house and you need to leave.

55:06.005 --> 55:07.040
- Baby, you're okay?

55:07.082 --> 55:08.803
Come on. - Go, did you hear me?

55:08.845 --> 55:11.028
Get the fuck out.

55:11.070 --> 55:12.653
- Fine, I am going.

55:14.145 --> 55:15.398
- Okay, bye.

55:18.155 --> 55:19.973
- What the was that about?

55:20.015 --> 55:22.823
- He's a clingy bitch, I don't want him in my house.

55:22.865 --> 55:23.930
- If you say so.

55:23.972 --> 55:26.963
(bright upbeat music)

55:27.005 --> 55:28.493
- I'll get ready for work.

55:28.535 --> 55:30.585
- Okay, see you later.

55:30.627 --> 55:33.774

55:49.834 --> 55:50.727

55:50.769 --> 55:51.560
- Are you okay?

55:51.602 --> 55:53.369
- What the fuck, why are you talking to me?

55:53.411 --> 55:54.202
- Are you okay?

55:54.244 --> 55:55.553

55:55.595 --> 55:57.173
Get the fuck away from me.

55:57.215 --> 55:58.913

56:03.351 --> 56:04.793
What part of that do you not understand?

56:04.835 --> 56:05.693
- Susan's on one side bed...

56:05.735 --> 56:07.463
- Stop talking to me, get the fuck away from me,

56:07.505 --> 56:08.296
shut the fuck up.

56:08.338 --> 56:09.383

56:11.135 --> 56:12.623
Don't fucking talk to me.

- Get your shit together.

56:15.669 --> 56:18.836
(bright upbeat music)

56:22.175 --> 56:24.143
- All right girl, so tell me, what's the tea?

56:24.185 --> 56:25.193
What's the meal? - Do you drink wine?

56:25.235 --> 56:26.903
I need you drunk so I can hear your tea.

56:26.945 --> 56:28.343
- I don't have any tea that important.

56:28.385 --> 56:30.585
- Yes, you do, you went on a date yesterday.

56:32.405 --> 56:36.203
That's what I heard at least, I saw you post about it

56:36.245 --> 56:37.793
so it must've been good.

56:37.835 --> 56:41.093
- Well, I posed it because the food was nice and...

56:41.135 --> 56:43.403
- You got his hand in it, that was like a soft launch.

56:43.445 --> 56:44.933
It was a nice ass hand too,

56:44.975 --> 56:45.861
I was like, damn, girl. - You know what?

56:45.903 --> 56:47.873
It's just to make some people jealous, okay?

56:47.915 --> 56:48.773

56:48.815 --> 56:50.530

- Okay, so what about you now?

57:29.495 --> 57:30.713
Tell me.

57:30.755 --> 57:33.893

57:33.935 --> 57:34.726
- You know what?

57:34.768 --> 57:35.843
You can't do that app anymore. - They're creepy.

57:35.885 --> 57:40.043
- Like it's creepy, it's horrible, there's just...

57:40.085 --> 57:43.035
- But they pay for dinner and your girl needs to eat, so...

57:44.022 --> 57:46.253
- That's right, that's a good point,

57:46.295 --> 57:47.625

Hey, you know who hit me up yesterday?

58:50.765 --> 58:51.863
- Yeah.

58:51.905 --> 58:54.128

58:54.170 --> 58:55.249
- Who the fuck is Glen?

58:55.291 --> 58:57.883
(sniffling loudly)

58:57.925 --> 59:01.038

59:02.599 --> 59:04.941
The one we had a threesome with?

59:04.983 --> 59:06.953

59:06.995 --> 59:08.082
- Yeah, you did.

59:08.124 --> 59:09.023

59:12.125 --> 59:14.783

59:14.825 --> 59:15.975
- Yeah, that wasn't me.

59:17.412 --> 59:18.313
- Really?

59:18.355 --> 59:21.293

59:21.335 --> 59:22.168
didn't you?

59:23.717 --> 59:24.817

59:29.255 --> 59:30.743
- Speaking off Poppy.

59:30.785 --> 59:32.093

59:52.865 --> 59:53.896
Or don't sleep at all.

Are you okay?

01:00:23.895 --> 01:00:27.218
- Yeah, I'm fine, I just haven't been sleeping.

01:00:28.475 --> 01:00:32.603
- Be careful or you'll be taking my place in this bed

01:00:32.645 --> 01:00:35.971
and trust me, the food really sucks here.

01:00:36.013 --> 01:00:37.550

if you could call me back

01:02:07.025 --> 01:02:10.163
because I am really worried about you, okay?

01:02:10.205 --> 01:02:12.413
It's just, it's not nice to do this to someone,

01:02:12.455 --> 01:02:15.263
so can you please just respond to my texts

01:02:15.305 --> 01:02:16.746
or just call me, please.

01:02:16.788 --> 01:02:19.955
(bright upbeat music)

01:02:29.461 --> 01:02:31.826
(phone ringing)

01:02:31.868 --> 01:02:33.968
- [Zee] Hey, leave a message, or don't.

01:02:34.824 --> 01:02:36.233
- You know what, you fucking bitch?

01:02:36.275 --> 01:02:39.683
Fuck you, yeah, fuck you honestly, honestly

01:02:39.725 --> 01:02:41.243
because this is not nice.

01:02:41.285 --> 01:02:43.103
No, you don't fucking do that to someone,

01:02:43.145 --> 01:02:45.053
you don't fucking do that to someone,

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:46.643
I've been worrying about you for days,

01:02:46.685 --> 01:02:47.476
why can't you fucking call me back?

01:02:47.518 --> 01:02:49.913
You're such a fucking asshole, you know that?

01:02:49.955 --> 01:02:54.083
You are a selfish, entitled
bitch and I'm not fucking sorry,

01:02:54.125 --> 01:02:56.603
because that's my truth, that's my fucking truth.

01:02:56.645 --> 01:02:58.073
So you better fucking call me back

01:02:58.115 --> 01:02:59.153
so we can talk this shit out

01:02:59.195 --> 01:03:00.080
because I'm done dealing with this

01:03:00.122 --> 01:03:01.643
and I'm fucking done with you.

01:03:01.685 --> 01:03:02.839
Call me.

01:03:02.881 --> 01:03:06.048
(bright upbeat music)

01:03:25.325 --> 01:03:27.353
Oh, look at who decided to show up.

01:03:27.395 --> 01:03:28.583
- Hey.

01:03:28.625 --> 01:03:29.953
- Where the fuck were you?

01:03:29.995 --> 01:03:30.786
- I'm crashing at the gallery,

01:03:30.828 --> 01:03:32.123
opening in three days, remember?

01:03:32.165 --> 01:03:32.956
- Bitch, don't fucking lie to me,

01:03:32.998 --> 01:03:35.183
you didn't have two minutes to call me back?

01:03:35.225 --> 01:03:37.733
- Like I haven't been able to take a fucking piss,

01:03:37.775 --> 01:03:39.353
Mark's been a tyrant.

01:03:39.395 --> 01:03:41.543
- I haven't seen you in two days

01:03:41.585 --> 01:03:43.223
since you went home with that fugly bitch.

01:03:43.265 --> 01:03:45.533
- That fugly bitch, you mean Heather?

01:03:45.575 --> 01:03:47.153
- [Charli] Yeah, I said it.

01:03:47.195 --> 01:03:48.223
- The only reason I was going home with her

01:03:48.265 --> 01:03:50.689
is 'cause you went home with some fucking guy, okay?

01:03:50.731 --> 01:03:51.522
- Okay, I'm...

01:03:51.564 --> 01:03:52.553
- I came back the next fucking day,

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:54.323
you were out so cold, okay?

01:03:54.365 --> 01:03:55.643
- Okay, that didn't happen... - Come back.

01:03:55.685 --> 01:03:56.843
- You're a fucking gaslighter,

01:03:56.885 --> 01:03:58.103
I did not go home with anyone,

01:03:58.145 --> 01:04:00.953
and yeah, she's a fugly bitch, I'm just being honest.

01:04:00.995 --> 01:04:03.083
- I don't have energy for this right now, okay?

01:04:03.125 --> 01:04:05.933
- You're fucking lying to me because that didn't happen.

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:06.902
- That's what you said you were gonna do

01:04:06.944 --> 01:04:08.813
and you're a real fucking asshole about it too,

01:04:08.855 --> 01:04:10.289
okay, Charli?

01:04:10.331 --> 01:04:11.231
I was just trying be a good friend,

01:04:11.273 --> 01:04:12.293
I was trying to give you some space

01:04:12.335 --> 01:04:15.568
so you could have some fun, last time we do that.

01:04:15.610 --> 01:04:16.443
- Okay.

01:04:17.632 --> 01:04:18.465
- Okay.

01:04:21.145 --> 01:04:22.745
- By the way, can I get a favor?

01:04:23.681 --> 01:04:24.472
- What?

01:04:24.514 --> 01:04:25.968
- Can I borrow your taser?

01:04:26.010 --> 01:04:27.267
- What now?

01:04:27.309 --> 01:04:29.751
- I'm not gonna use it on you, I've got business to do.

01:04:29.793 --> 01:04:32.230
I have business to do, can I just borrow it?

01:04:32.272 --> 01:04:34.210
Please, oh my god.

01:04:34.252 --> 01:04:37.253
- Okay, yeah, you can have my fucking taser,

01:04:37.295 --> 01:04:38.249
you can have it.

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:39.663
- Okay, good, thanks.

01:04:39.705 --> 01:04:43.299
(bright upbeat music)

01:04:43.341 --> 01:04:46.174
(knocking loudly)

01:04:48.389 --> 01:04:52.324
(bright upbeat music)

01:04:52.366 --> 01:04:55.143
(knocking loudly)

01:04:55.185 --> 01:04:58.352
(bright upbeat music)

01:05:01.596 --> 01:05:04.310
(knocking loudly)

01:05:04.352 --> 01:05:07.519
(bright upbeat music)

01:05:12.391 --> 01:05:16.308
(knocking loudly persistently)

01:05:18.629 --> 01:05:19.913
- Time to apologize, I guess.

01:05:19.955 --> 01:05:21.643
- Hey, what's up?

01:05:21.685 --> 01:05:22.685
- What's up?

01:05:23.708 --> 01:05:26.147
- I need you to introduce me to Sarah.

01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:26.980
- What?

01:05:27.022 --> 01:05:27.813
Fuck no.

01:05:27.855 --> 01:05:29.423
- What, come on, it'll take like 10 minutes,

01:05:29.465 --> 01:05:30.256
we'll go in there,

01:05:30.298 --> 01:05:31.853
you'll be like, "Hi, this is my girlfriend",

01:05:31.895 --> 01:05:33.506
"she's really cool," and we'll do the thing and we'll go.

01:05:33.548 --> 01:05:35.393
It'll take 10 minutes, come on.

01:05:35.435 --> 01:05:37.523
- Now you're okay with being my girlfriend?

01:05:37.565 --> 01:05:40.899
- I was always okay with that,
what are you talking about?

01:05:40.941 --> 01:05:41.741
- Charli?

01:05:41.783 --> 01:05:42.574
- Come on, what?

01:05:42.616 --> 01:05:45.563
It'll in 10 minutes, it will literally take 10 minutes.

01:05:45.605 --> 01:05:46.396
We'll go in...

01:05:46.438 --> 01:05:47.723
- Charli, hang on. - We'll do our thing

01:05:47.765 --> 01:05:48.556
and then it'll be good.

01:05:48.598 --> 01:05:49.583
What the fuck is wrong? - Charli?

01:05:49.625 --> 01:05:51.667
- This is what you wanted, right?

01:05:51.709 --> 01:05:52.502
Isn't it? - Charli, stop.

01:05:52.544 --> 01:05:53.377
- Isn't it? - Charli, stop.

01:05:54.405 --> 01:05:55.703
- What? - I said, stop.

01:05:55.745 --> 01:05:57.653
- What the fuck, what the fuck is wrong with you?

01:05:57.695 --> 01:05:58.853
Why won't you fucking help me?

01:05:58.895 --> 01:06:00.173
- Because you're out of your mind right now.

01:06:00.215 --> 01:06:01.006
- Are you kidding me?

01:06:01.048 --> 01:06:03.446
I'm asking for your fucking help, what the fuck?

01:06:03.488 --> 01:06:04.448
- Hey, Charli, I know you said you...

01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:05.806
- Fuck you, fuck you, you know what?

01:06:05.848 --> 01:06:07.971
I don't need you, I can just go there by my fucking self.

01:06:08.013 --> 01:06:10.875
- Hey, yo, Charli, stay away from Sarah, she's a fucking...

01:06:10.917 --> 01:06:11.933
Hey, stay away... - Fuck you.

01:06:11.975 --> 01:06:13.832
- Stay away from Sarah, she's a fucking predator.

01:06:13.874 --> 01:06:15.360
- Oh yeah, predator, well, I'll just...

01:06:15.402 --> 01:06:16.193
(door opening)

01:06:16.235 --> 01:06:18.068
- Hey, Charli, Charli?

01:06:20.102 --> 01:06:20.893
Fuck.

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:24.102
(bright upbeat music)

01:06:26.343 --> 01:06:28.369
(banging door loudly)

01:06:28.411 --> 01:06:31.822
(bright upbeat music)

01:06:31.864 --> 01:06:33.141
(knocking loudly)

01:06:33.183 --> 01:06:34.073
(bright upbeat music)

01:06:34.115 --> 01:06:36.500
- Hey, what's up, how's it going?

01:06:36.542 --> 01:06:39.203
I'm a friend of Kyle's, I'm actually his girlfriend,

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:41.123
and is Sarah around

01:06:41.165 --> 01:06:43.210
'cause I gotta talk to her about some business?

01:06:43.252 --> 01:06:44.393
(door closing)

01:06:44.435 --> 01:06:45.713
Hey, can you please open up?

01:06:45.755 --> 01:06:47.234
It'll just take a minute.

01:06:47.276 --> 01:06:48.067
(knocking on door)

01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:49.373
Come on, please.

01:06:49.415 --> 01:06:53.738
Hey, wait a minute, it'll just take a minute.

01:06:54.815 --> 01:06:55.703
You won't...

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:57.205
- Keep the fucking noise down.

01:06:57.247 --> 01:07:00.414
(bright upbeat music)

01:07:03.023 --> 01:07:04.513
Sit.

01:07:04.555 --> 01:07:07.722
(bright upbeat music)

01:07:12.197 --> 01:07:15.114
(knocking on door)

01:07:18.181 --> 01:07:19.853
(door opening)

01:07:19.895 --> 01:07:21.938
- Sarah, hey, what's up?

01:07:23.345 --> 01:07:25.613
I'm Kyle's girlfriend,

01:07:25.655 --> 01:07:30.548
he sent me here to pick up some stuff for him, here.

01:07:34.443 --> 01:07:36.008
- You have the wrong house.

01:07:37.445 --> 01:07:39.503
- No, I've been coming here for months,

01:07:39.545 --> 01:07:42.128
I just, I wait outside in the car,

01:07:43.175 --> 01:07:45.083
I'm not a cop or anything like that.

01:07:45.125 --> 01:07:48.113
Here, I can have him call you and he can...

01:07:48.155 --> 01:07:50.123
- That won't be necessary.

01:07:50.165 --> 01:07:52.808
- Well, okay, cool, so you'll hook me up?

01:07:54.095 --> 01:07:58.388
- Sure, take off your clothes first.

01:08:01.565 --> 01:08:04.283
- But I already said I'm not a cop or anything.

01:08:04.325 --> 01:08:06.713
- Tack, escort this young lady out.

01:08:06.755 --> 01:08:09.057
- No, it's cool, I can do it.

01:08:09.099 --> 01:08:12.266
(bright upbeat music)

01:08:27.305 --> 01:08:29.858
- The bra too, please.

01:08:30.725 --> 01:08:33.375
- But you can see I'm not wearing a wire or anything.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.594
- Do you know who I am?

01:08:38.465 --> 01:08:42.353
If you fuck with me, Tack here is gonna tie you up,

01:08:42.395 --> 01:08:45.893
have friends run a little
train on you while I record it

01:08:45.935 --> 01:08:47.813
and put it on the internet.

01:08:47.855 --> 01:08:49.799
Now, the bra, please.

01:08:49.841 --> 01:08:53.008
(bright upbeat music)

01:09:00.302 --> 01:09:02.928
(breathing deeply)

01:09:02.970 --> 01:09:06.743
(camera shuttering)

01:09:06.785 --> 01:09:07.618
Turn.

01:09:10.028 --> 01:09:12.688
(camera shuttering)

01:09:12.730 --> 01:09:15.897
(bright upbeat music)

01:09:17.521 --> 01:09:18.408
(camera shuttering)

01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:20.107
(bright upbeat music)

01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:21.739
You may dress now.

01:09:21.781 --> 01:09:24.948
(bright upbeat music)

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.248
Sorry, you have to excuse me,

01:09:49.346 --> 01:09:51.263
you can't trust people nowadays.

01:09:51.305 --> 01:09:53.213
- Yeah, no, it's cool, I get it.

01:09:53.255 --> 01:09:58.238
- So what can I do for you, Charli, was it?

01:10:00.005 --> 01:10:01.105
- Do you have any Oxy?

01:10:02.555 --> 01:10:04.163
- It's kinda hard to come by nowadays,

01:10:04.205 --> 01:10:07.028
but I can accommodate.

01:10:11.885 --> 01:10:13.435
So how long you been with Kyle?

01:10:14.945 --> 01:10:16.208
- Six months or so.

01:10:17.195 --> 01:10:19.628
- You guys probably fuck every day, huh?

01:10:22.025 --> 01:10:23.125
- Something like that.

01:10:33.015 --> 01:10:37.196
- Don't show up here for another two weeks at least.

01:10:37.238 --> 01:10:40.223
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's totally fine.

01:10:40.265 --> 01:10:41.873
- I mean it.

01:10:41.915 --> 01:10:44.165
I can't have you junkies running around here.

01:10:45.005 --> 01:10:47.639
- Cool, yeah, thank you again.

01:10:47.681 --> 01:10:50.177
(feet stomping)

01:10:50.219 --> 01:10:53.386
(bright upbeat music)

01:11:07.528 --> 01:11:10.763
- Charli, I'm thinking about what you said the other day

01:11:10.805 --> 01:11:12.805
about running away, becoming new people,

01:11:17.468 --> 01:11:21.563
I'm trying to think how to
pull something like that off.

01:11:21.605 --> 01:11:25.268
I realize disappearing is not about pretending, no,

01:11:26.885 --> 01:11:28.585
it's about forgetting who you are.

01:11:30.485 --> 01:11:32.985
I realize I do that every day and it makes me sad.

01:11:35.485 --> 01:11:37.685
I kinda hate the things that I used to love,

01:11:42.515 --> 01:11:47.515
I wanna get clean for a while,
we should get sober together.

01:11:48.036 --> 01:11:51.833
(bright upbeat music)

01:11:51.875 --> 01:11:53.903
- I don't really think I'm ready for that.

01:11:53.945 --> 01:11:57.878
- Baby, please, I really need you through this.

01:12:02.436 --> 01:12:03.806
- Okay.

01:12:03.848 --> 01:12:05.993
- Okay, settled then.

01:12:06.035 --> 01:12:09.508
Bump till it's gone, then start over.

01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:13.116
(bright upbeat music)

01:12:13.158 --> 01:12:16.283
(air whooshing)

01:12:16.325 --> 01:12:19.788
Hey Ricky, it's me, I need
your services, gimme a call back.

01:12:20.707 --> 01:12:21.540
Fuck.

01:12:24.125 --> 01:12:26.633
- What about that guy you went out with last week?

01:12:26.675 --> 01:12:28.103
- He's not gonna know anyone.

01:12:28.145 --> 01:12:29.543
- Can you try?

01:12:29.585 --> 01:12:30.755
- Yeah, sure.

01:12:30.797 --> 01:12:33.964
(bright upbeat music)

01:12:35.915 --> 01:12:39.578
Hey, sent, but I ghosted him, he's not gonna reply.

01:12:40.535 --> 01:12:42.803
We should stay night (murmurs) and pass out.

01:12:42.845 --> 01:12:45.143
- You know that's not gonna work.

01:12:45.185 --> 01:12:46.018
- Oh.

01:12:47.375 --> 01:12:49.613
- What about, what about Samuel?

01:12:49.655 --> 01:12:50.513
- Who?

01:12:50.555 --> 01:12:53.033
- That guy from the coffee
shop who's always hitting on you.

01:12:53.075 --> 01:12:53.866
- What am I supposed to say?

01:12:53.908 --> 01:12:55.793
Order a latte and ask me if he's in on any dope?

01:12:55.835 --> 01:12:57.353
- I mean.

01:12:57.395 --> 01:13:01.373
- No, what about Sarah?

01:13:01.415 --> 01:13:02.993
- She said I can't come back till next Thursday

01:13:03.035 --> 01:13:05.033
and she was real specific about that.

01:13:05.075 --> 01:13:06.773
- Where did Kyle go, what's the big deal?

01:13:06.815 --> 01:13:07.958
- Fuck Kyle.

01:13:10.415 --> 01:13:14.633
Oh my god, oh my God, yes, yes,

01:13:14.675 --> 01:13:18.683
Trevor has a whole fucking pharmacy at his place.

01:13:18.725 --> 01:13:19.516
- Who's Trevor?

01:13:19.558 --> 01:13:21.533
- He's a scumbag from my work.

01:13:21.575 --> 01:13:22.943
- Why haven't you called him then?

01:13:22.985 --> 01:13:27.053
- Well, he's out of town, but we can break into his house.

01:13:27.095 --> 01:13:28.523
- You're insane.

01:13:28.565 --> 01:13:32.873
- Come on, he fucking deserves it, he's an asshole, okay?

01:13:32.915 --> 01:13:35.003
- I'm not breaking into someone's house.

01:13:35.045 --> 01:13:38.843
- Okay, listen, objectively,
this is the right thing to do.

01:13:38.885 --> 01:13:41.663
He sucks, he has all those drugs

01:13:41.705 --> 01:13:42.953
and he's just gonna use them

01:13:42.995 --> 01:13:45.293
to get these girls to do fucked up shit to him

01:13:45.335 --> 01:13:46.643
and trust me on this, okay?

01:13:46.685 --> 01:13:47.918
Just trust me, I know.

01:13:49.032 --> 01:13:51.113
- Okay, and how are you gonna get in.

01:13:51.155 --> 01:13:51.946
Do you have keys?

01:13:51.988 --> 01:13:52.779
- Do you know how many times

01:13:52.821 --> 01:13:54.293
I've broken into my mom's house?

01:13:54.335 --> 01:13:55.853
It'll literally take me two minutes, okay?

01:13:55.895 --> 01:13:58.763
We'll go in, two minutes, we'll be out, okay?

01:13:58.805 --> 01:14:00.218
Trust me, I've got it.

01:14:01.447 --> 01:14:04.013
- I fucking know Charli's too sketchy for me.

01:14:04.055 --> 01:14:08.026
- Okay, can you drive me there though?

01:14:08.068 --> 01:14:09.623
- You're fucking serious, aren't you?

01:14:09.665 --> 01:14:11.978
- I'm not gonna Uber to the robbery.

01:14:13.865 --> 01:14:15.443
- See what, I'm in

01:14:15.485 --> 01:14:18.128
but if I get one hint of a bad feeling, I'm out.

01:14:19.865 --> 01:14:20.656
- I love you.

01:14:20.698 --> 01:14:21.489
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:14:21.531 --> 01:14:22.322
- Let's fucking go.

01:14:22.364 --> 01:14:23.963
- Let's go...

01:14:24.005 --> 01:14:25.493
You're sure this is a good idea?

01:14:25.535 --> 01:14:27.867
- Yeah, it's fine, in and out, five minutes.

01:14:27.909 --> 01:14:29.326
- Okay, we'll go.

01:14:31.654 --> 01:14:34.321
(feet stomping)

01:14:37.928 --> 01:14:39.668
Charli, Hurry up.

01:14:40.865 --> 01:14:43.083
- Okay, I'm trying as best as I can, here we go.

01:14:43.125 --> 01:14:44.216
- Charli, I feel like I hear something.

01:14:44.258 --> 01:14:46.198
- It's okay, fine, calm down, okay?

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:47.073
- Okay.

01:14:51.417 --> 01:14:52.892
- I got it...

01:14:52.934 --> 01:14:54.369
- Okay, let's go.

01:14:54.411 --> 01:14:56.132
Okay, let's go...

01:14:56.174 --> 01:14:56.965
(bright upbeat music)

01:14:57.007 --> 01:15:01.612
Should he have an alarm set or something?

01:15:01.654 --> 01:15:03.243
(pills jiggling)

01:15:03.285 --> 01:15:05.423
That's what we broke in for?

01:15:05.465 --> 01:15:07.148
- There were more, I swear.

01:15:08.015 --> 01:15:09.173
- Could he take them or something?

01:15:09.215 --> 01:15:11.376
- No, they have to be here.

01:15:11.418 --> 01:15:14.585
(bright upbeat music)

01:15:20.345 --> 01:15:21.533
- If he's outta town he would've made the bed up

01:15:21.575 --> 01:15:22.384
or some shit.

01:15:22.426 --> 01:15:23.217
(bright upbeat music)

01:15:23.259 --> 01:15:25.599
- He probably has a maid coming or something.

01:15:25.641 --> 01:15:27.887
(bright upbeat music)

01:15:27.929 --> 01:15:29.783
- Charli, this don't feel right.

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:31.493
- Look, the sooner we can find them,

01:15:31.535 --> 01:15:32.943
the sooner we get out of here.

01:15:32.985 --> 01:15:35.633
So, I don't know, check the closet or something.

01:15:35.675 --> 01:15:38.613
- Okay. (feet stomping)

01:15:38.655 --> 01:15:40.489
- Who the fuck is you?

01:15:40.531 --> 01:15:41.322
(vibrating loudly)

01:15:41.364 --> 01:15:44.853
(wailing painfully)

01:15:44.895 --> 01:15:46.673
- Don't fucking touch her.

01:15:46.715 --> 01:15:49.193
- You junkie bitch, I knew it.

01:15:49.235 --> 01:15:50.026
- Where are the pills?

01:15:50.068 --> 01:15:52.653
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:15:52.695 --> 01:15:53.753
(vibrating loudly)

01:15:53.795 --> 01:15:57.413
- The ones you keep in the living room, where are they?

01:15:57.455 --> 01:15:59.108
- I sold that shit days ago.

01:16:00.005 --> 01:16:01.553
- Then where's the money you got for them?

01:16:01.595 --> 01:16:04.445
- [Zee] Charli, let's get out of here, it's not worth it.

01:16:05.675 --> 01:16:07.609
- Tell me where it is.

01:16:07.651 --> 01:16:09.713
- It's in my bank account.

01:16:09.755 --> 01:16:11.528
You think I'd keep cash here?

01:16:12.785 --> 01:16:14.723
- Charli, let's fucking go.

01:16:14.765 --> 01:16:16.133
- You dumb little cunt,

01:16:16.175 --> 01:16:18.138
you didn't think this through, did you?

01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:19.390
- Shut up.

01:16:19.432 --> 01:16:20.573
- You are finished, you hear me?

01:16:20.615 --> 01:16:21.909
You are fucking...

01:16:21.951 --> 01:16:24.868
(vibrating loudly)

01:16:27.095 --> 01:16:28.418
- Zee, grab the blankets.

01:16:31.145 --> 01:16:32.783
Zee, let's fucking go, we have to tie him up

01:16:32.825 --> 01:16:35.122
before he wakes up, we have about 60 seconds, let's go.

01:16:35.164 --> 01:16:37.131
- Okay, what did you do?

01:16:37.173 --> 01:16:38.292
What did you do?

01:16:38.334 --> 01:16:41.501
(bright upbeat music)

01:17:05.692 --> 01:17:07.906
(door opening)

01:17:07.948 --> 01:17:10.615
(feet stomping)

01:17:12.598 --> 01:17:14.903
I have a concussion.

01:17:14.945 --> 01:17:16.283
- You don't have a concussion.

01:17:16.325 --> 01:17:17.764
- Do you think he called the cops?

01:17:17.806 --> 01:17:18.639
- No, hell no.

01:17:19.565 --> 01:17:20.356
- Does he know where you live?

01:17:20.398 --> 01:17:21.189
Is he gonna come here?

01:17:21.231 --> 01:17:23.648
- No way, I'll just get a new job, that's fines.

01:17:25.505 --> 01:17:26.663
Okay, drugs.

01:17:26.705 --> 01:17:27.538
- What?

01:17:28.565 --> 01:17:29.868
- The bag of the drugs, you have it, right?

01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:30.773
- I thought you had it, shit.

01:17:30.815 --> 01:17:31.973
- What the fuck?

01:17:32.015 --> 01:17:34.793
You don't have the fucking
drugs, are you fucking serious?

01:17:34.835 --> 01:17:35.626
- Everything was so messed up.

01:17:35.668 --> 01:17:37.115
- What the fuck did we do that for...

01:17:37.157 --> 01:17:38.974
(shouting loudly)

01:17:39.016 --> 01:17:40.612
you're the fucking bitch.

01:17:40.654 --> 01:17:42.504
- What the fuck did you just call me?

01:17:43.835 --> 01:17:45.145
Come back here.

01:17:45.187 --> 01:17:48.687
(pulling drawers roughly)

01:17:59.588 --> 01:18:00.596
What the fuck are you doing?

01:18:00.638 --> 01:18:02.601
- Your emergency stuff, where the fuck is it?

01:18:02.643 --> 01:18:04.524
- [Zee] I don't have an emergency stuff really.

01:18:04.566 --> 01:18:06.711
- (murmurs) I know you do, tell me where the fuck it is.

01:18:06.753 --> 01:18:09.178
- You know if I had it 'cause we would've done it.

01:18:10.175 --> 01:18:12.523
- What the fuck are you good for then?

01:18:12.565 --> 01:18:13.356
What the fuck?

01:18:13.398 --> 01:18:15.158
- Jesus Christ, excuse me.

01:18:16.535 --> 01:18:18.323
- How many times do you fucking use my drugs?

01:18:18.365 --> 01:18:19.156
Every fucking day, right?

01:18:19.198 --> 01:18:21.893
And you can't even gimme one fucking pill?

01:18:21.935 --> 01:18:24.188
- If I had one, I would, okay?

01:18:25.955 --> 01:18:29.789
- I'm so fucking sick of you using me.

01:18:29.831 --> 01:18:32.484
- Using you, using you?

01:18:32.526 --> 01:18:34.839
Who the fuck do you think is paying rent in the past,

01:18:34.881 --> 01:18:36.750
you useless fucking bitch?

01:18:36.792 --> 01:18:37.958
- If I had a trust fund, you fucking bitch,

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:38.791
I'd pay the rent too.

01:18:38.833 --> 01:18:40.643
- What the fuck did you just say?

01:18:40.685 --> 01:18:44.543
- Yeah, you fucking heard me, you owe me.

01:18:44.585 --> 01:18:45.376
- For what?

01:18:45.418 --> 01:18:46.943
- Tonight I fucking saved your life,

01:18:46.985 --> 01:18:48.293
Trevor was gonna kill you.

01:18:48.335 --> 01:18:50.556
- I was only there because of you, fool.

01:18:50.598 --> 01:18:52.661
- Fucking shit... - You fucking junkie...

01:18:52.703 --> 01:18:54.296
- You wanted the pills just as much as I did,

01:18:54.338 --> 01:18:55.711
you're the fucking junkie.

01:18:55.753 --> 01:18:56.544
- Whatever.

01:18:56.586 --> 01:18:59.483
- Okay, yeah, go to one of your fuck buddies

01:18:59.525 --> 01:19:02.603
or better yet, go fuck my boyfriend again.

01:19:02.645 --> 01:19:03.971
- What are you talking about?

01:19:04.013 --> 01:19:05.179
- What fucking kind of friend are you?

01:19:05.221 --> 01:19:06.653
I know about you and Kyle.

01:19:06.695 --> 01:19:09.054
- I would never do that to you, I didn't shit with Kyle...

01:19:09.096 --> 01:19:13.343
(girls shouting and screaming)

01:19:13.385 --> 01:19:14.620
- Fuck you, tell me where your fucking money is

01:19:14.662 --> 01:19:16.523
'cause I know you fucking well enough,

01:19:16.565 --> 01:19:17.979
I know your parents give you money,

01:19:18.021 --> 01:19:19.411
I like if you wouldn't be here,

01:19:19.453 --> 01:19:20.693
you would be at the fucking streets

01:19:20.735 --> 01:19:23.270
'cause you're fucking useless, you're fucking useless.

01:19:23.312 --> 01:19:25.253
Now tell me where your fucking money is, tell me.

01:19:25.295 --> 01:19:26.455
- You know they... - Tell me where it is...

01:19:26.497 --> 01:19:27.798
- They don't fucking... - Tell me where it is,

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:28.631
- They cut me off.

01:19:28.673 --> 01:19:30.328
- Tell me where it is.

01:19:30.370 --> 01:19:31.468
- You know that I'm not...

01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:32.549
- Tell me where fucking...

01:19:32.591 --> 01:19:33.382
(Zee screaming)

01:19:33.424 --> 01:19:35.896
Tell me where fucking it is, tell me now.

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:38.783
Tell me, tell me fucking now.

01:19:38.825 --> 01:19:40.129
- You know they cut me off.

01:19:40.171 --> 01:19:42.607
- No, they didn't, you fucking liar.

01:19:42.649 --> 01:19:44.771
You liar, why the fuck are you lying to me?

01:19:44.813 --> 01:19:46.387
- The drawer, its' in the drawer there.

01:19:46.429 --> 01:19:49.214
That's all you fucking can have.

01:19:49.256 --> 01:19:54.173
Tell you what (mumbling), you fucking did.

01:19:55.122 --> 01:19:58.598
Get out my door (mumbles)
because I'm fucking done with you.

01:20:00.831 --> 01:20:02.398
But I know it.

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:07.440
- Wait, Zee, I'm sorry.

01:20:10.145 --> 01:20:13.373
Zee, I'm sorry, okay?

01:20:13.415 --> 01:20:16.699
- No, bye bitch, I'm fucking done with you.

01:20:16.741 --> 01:20:19.908
(bright upbeat music)

01:20:23.432 --> 01:20:27.349
(kicking and shouting angrily)

01:20:37.276 --> 01:20:40.976
(bright upbeat music)

01:20:41.018 --> 01:20:43.685
(phone ringing)

01:20:45.029 --> 01:20:47.135
Why won't you answer the phone, you fucking bitch?

01:20:47.177 --> 01:20:49.157
- [Zee] Hey, leave a message, or don't.

01:20:49.199 --> 01:20:52.116
(shouting angrily)

01:20:54.346 --> 01:20:56.670
- You fucking bitch.

01:20:56.712 --> 01:20:59.879
(bright upbeat music)

01:21:03.006 --> 01:21:06.173
(whimpering bitterly)

01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:19.038
(phone ringing)

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:24.080
- [Zee] Hey, leave a message, or don't.

01:21:25.235 --> 01:21:27.038

01:21:32.375 --> 01:21:33.578
I'm sorry, okay?

01:21:36.228 --> 01:21:37.373
Zee, I'm just really worried about you

01:21:37.415 --> 01:21:39.023
so if you could call me back whenever you get this,

01:21:39.065 --> 01:21:40.415
that would be really great.

01:21:44.442 --> 01:21:47.033
(crying bitterly)

01:21:47.075 --> 01:21:48.291
I'm sorry.

01:21:48.333 --> 01:21:51.500
(bright upbeat music)

01:21:52.805 --> 01:21:54.505
I don't know what's wrong with me,

01:21:58.066 --> 01:21:59.889
I didn't mean what I said, I swear.

01:21:59.931 --> 01:22:03.098
(bright upbeat music)

01:22:04.745 --> 01:22:06.913
I'm just in a lot of pain right now

and it just really hurts and I'm so scared.

01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:14.170

I really, really need you, I need my Zee,

01:22:21.695 --> 01:22:24.623
so if you could come back and we could just talk it out,

01:22:24.665 --> 01:22:26.362

01:22:28.594 --> 01:22:31.556
Please just come back, okay?

01:22:58.450 --> 01:22:59.747
(door hinges squeaking)

01:22:59.789 --> 01:23:01.018
Hey, what's up?

01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:04.311

01:23:09.663 --> 01:23:12.830
(bright upbeat music)

01:23:20.225 --> 01:23:21.175
- I like your hair.

01:23:25.715 --> 01:23:27.420
What kinda gel do you use?

01:23:27.462 --> 01:23:30.629
(bright upbeat music)

01:23:35.048 --> 01:23:36.468
(feet stomping)

01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:39.677
(bright upbeat music)

01:23:57.318 --> 01:23:59.212
Is it from CVS or something?

01:23:59.254 --> 01:24:02.243
(bright upbeat music)

01:24:02.285 --> 01:24:03.118

(bright upbeat music)

01:24:15.752 --> 01:24:17.352
- Has it been two weeks already?

01:24:18.785 --> 01:24:21.023
I haven't seen your boyfriend in a while,

01:24:21.065 --> 01:24:22.965
should I be expecting you from now on?

01:24:24.725 --> 01:24:25.618
- We broke up.

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:28.163
(bright upbeat music)

01:24:28.205 --> 01:24:29.085
- It happens.

01:24:34.219 --> 01:24:39.219
So I don't have any more Oxy, but I do have some fentanyl.

01:24:42.485 --> 01:24:45.608
I'll give it to you for a good price, yeah?

01:24:51.515 --> 01:24:53.019
Would you like a taste?

01:24:53.061 --> 01:24:56.228
(bright upbeat music)

01:25:04.355 --> 01:25:05.755
You hurt so much, don't you?

01:25:07.745 --> 01:25:08.559
In here?

01:25:08.601 --> 01:25:11.768

That's okay.

01:25:15.682 --> 01:25:17.730
(shuffling roughly)

01:25:17.772 --> 01:25:19.772
You don't have to feel anything anymore.

01:25:22.325 --> 01:25:23.515
Now open up.

01:25:23.557 --> 01:25:26.724
(bright upbeat music)

01:25:33.455 --> 01:25:34.905
How much money did you bring?

01:25:36.065 --> 01:25:36.898
- 200.

01:25:39.515 --> 01:25:41.483
- Don't worry about that right now,

01:25:41.525 --> 01:25:46.148
you can give it to Tack on your way out, just relax,

01:25:48.065 --> 01:25:49.397

01:25:49.439 --> 01:25:52.606
(bright upbeat music)

01:25:57.125 --> 01:26:02.125
Everything's gonna be okay,
you have nothing to worry about.

01:26:02.429 --> 01:26:05.596
(bright upbeat music)

01:26:07.315 --> 01:26:08.742

01:26:08.784 --> 01:26:11.951
(bright upbeat music)

01:26:17.402 --> 01:26:20.652
Just relax, everything's gonna be okay.

(bright upbeat music)

01:26:41.646 --> 01:26:44.313
- Come on, it's time to wake up.

01:26:47.972 --> 01:26:51.073
Come on, Charli, time to wake up.

01:26:51.115 --> 01:26:54.282
(bright upbeat music)

01:27:37.889 --> 01:27:39.809
- What do you think?

01:27:39.851 --> 01:27:41.325
- She looks good.

01:27:41.367 --> 01:27:46.367
- Yeah, good morning, sleepy head,

01:27:46.985 --> 01:27:49.073
do you want some breakfast?

01:27:49.115 --> 01:27:50.183
- No, I'm good.

01:27:50.225 --> 01:27:52.913
- Tack, fix our guest something to eat.♪♪

01:27:52.955 --> 01:27:55.043
- [Charli] No, really, I'm fine.

01:27:55.085 --> 01:27:57.488
- Nonsense, you should stay a while.

01:27:59.195 --> 01:28:00.682
- I actually gotta go, so...

01:28:00.724 --> 01:28:03.474
(money rustling)

01:28:05.135 --> 01:28:09.083
- Hmm, this isn't enough.

01:28:09.125 --> 01:28:10.553
- What do you mean?

01:28:10.595 --> 01:28:13.223
That's the 200, like we said.

01:28:13.265 --> 01:28:18.265
- Charli, you've been here for two days,

01:28:18.425 --> 01:28:22.118
you've done way more than $200's worth.

01:28:23.555 --> 01:28:24.388
- What?

01:28:27.005 --> 01:28:31.643
No, no, I just got here.

01:28:31.685 --> 01:28:32.935
- You're sure about that?

01:28:36.575 --> 01:28:37.692
- How much do I owe?

01:28:38.975 --> 01:28:42.998
- Well, let's try another 200 plus the 200 right there.

01:28:45.545 --> 01:28:47.078
- I don't think I have that.

01:28:48.425 --> 01:28:51.023
- That's gonna be a problem, isn't it?

01:28:51.065 --> 01:28:51.908
Sit down.

01:28:53.015 --> 01:28:54.803
- Wait, no, I do have it, I do,

01:28:54.845 --> 01:28:56.603

01:28:56.645 --> 01:28:58.163

01:29:11.435 --> 01:29:13.328

01:29:14.165 --> 01:29:15.361
- Stay back.

01:29:15.403 --> 01:29:16.194

01:29:17.519 --> 01:29:18.443
(bright upbeat music)

01:29:18.485 --> 01:29:19.685
Do you think I'm scared?

01:29:26.855 --> 01:29:28.913
You know we'll find you, right?

01:29:28.955 --> 01:29:33.608
Whatever little hole you
crawl into, we're gonna find you.

01:29:35.461 --> 01:29:37.426

I fucking hate you.

01:29:52.479 --> 01:29:55.646
(bright upbeat music)

01:30:00.508 --> 01:30:04.321
Fuck you, you fucking cunt, I

- [Charli's Mom] Charli, this really isn't the best time.

01:31:26.523 --> 01:31:31.523
- Oh, okay, sorry to bother you.

01:31:37.507 --> 01:31:39.552
- [Charli's Mom] Have you thought anymore

01:31:41.495 --> 01:31:43.628
about getting into the program?

01:31:46.844 --> 01:31:47.723
Charli?

01:31:47.765 --> 01:31:49.558
- I think it's too late for that now.

01:31:55.351 --> 01:32:00.351

01:32:01.594 --> 01:32:03.344
what happened to her?

01:32:09.605 --> 01:32:10.535

01:32:36.108 --> 01:32:38.242
(bright upbeat music)

01:32:38.284 --> 01:32:39.075

01:32:39.117 --> 01:32:40.545
This is what you wanted.

01:32:40.587 --> 01:32:43.378

01:33:14.847 --> 01:33:16.930
Charli, I'm here, Charli.

01:33:18.358 --> 01:33:22.066
Holy shit, oh my God.

01:33:22.108 --> 01:33:24.428
Okay, baby, baby come on, wake up.

01:33:25.625 --> 01:33:27.973
Oh my God, don't do this to me.

Look at me, I need you to open your eyes.

01:33:37.625 --> 01:33:41.035
Wake the fuck up, I need you to wake the fuck up.

01:33:41.077 --> 01:33:43.327
Charli, Charli, okay, okay.

01:33:46.268 --> 01:33:49.339
Wake the fuck up, Charli, Charli.

01:33:49.381 --> 01:33:50.172
(whimpering worriedly)

01:33:50.214 --> 01:33:51.047

01:33:52.625 --> 01:33:53.458
- Holy shit.

01:33:55.772 --> 01:33:59.633
I thought I lost you, don't you ever do that again.

01:33:59.675 --> 01:34:00.638
Do you understand?

01:34:01.771 --> 01:34:02.604
- Do what?

01:34:03.612 --> 01:34:05.053

(bright upbeat music)

01:34:12.922 --> 01:34:16.297

01:34:18.339 --> 01:34:20.824
(bright upbeat music)

01:34:20.866 --> 01:34:21.699
Not yet.

Holy shit.

01:34:26.538 --> 01:34:29.767
(bright upbeat music)

01:34:29.809 --> 01:34:30.600
Charli.

01:34:30.642 --> 01:34:33.809
(bright upbeat music)

01:35:24.365 --> 01:35:25.643
- You stayed.

01:35:25.685 --> 01:35:27.608
- Of course, I live here.

01:35:31.565 --> 01:35:36.038
- Yeah, I didn't know, I guess, after all the things I said,

01:35:37.715 --> 01:35:39.218
I was a real cunt, huh?

01:35:42.485 --> 01:35:43.318
What is that?

01:35:45.085 --> 01:35:46.133
- It's what my insides would look like

01:35:46.175 --> 01:35:47.588
if I swallowed bleach.

01:35:49.466 --> 01:35:52.451
- Yeah, I see that.

01:35:52.493 --> 01:35:56.768
Hey, you know how we talked about running away?

01:35:57.965 --> 01:35:58.798
- Yeah.

01:36:00.125 --> 01:36:02.382
- What if we went and did that right now?

01:36:03.877 --> 01:36:05.477
- I'm not done with my painting.

01:36:07.865 --> 01:36:11.573
- No, but listen, we need to go right now, okay?

01:36:11.615 --> 01:36:13.943
Some serious stuff is about to go down

01:36:13.985 --> 01:36:15.233
and I really think we should just go.

01:36:15.275 --> 01:36:16.493
So can we go please?

01:36:16.535 --> 01:36:17.483
- Because of Trevor?

01:36:17.525 --> 01:36:20.933
- No, I can't explain it, okay?

01:36:20.975 --> 01:36:23.251
Just, okay, I stole from some really bad people...

01:36:23.293 --> 01:36:24.084
- Charli.

01:36:24.126 --> 01:36:24.917
- And they're gonna come get me

01:36:24.959 --> 01:36:29.093
