10:06.022 --> 10:08.107
IS THAT WHY YOU HAVE TIME TO
HASSLE ME?

10:08.107 --> 10:09.900
I WANT A SENSE OF WHY A SMART
GIRL LIKE YOU

10:09.900 --> 10:11.277
WOULD WANT TO COOK HER BRAIN.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.363
WHAT, ARE YOU REVVING UP FOR
SOME BIG ANTI-DRUG SPEECH?

10:14.363 --> 10:15.740
YOUR PARENTS
EVER GIVE YOU ONE?

10:15.740 --> 10:17.658
WHY ARE YOU SO FASCINATED
WITH MY PARENTS?

10:17.658 --> 10:19.869
DID THEY GIVE YOU THE IDEA
IT'S OKAY TO GET HIGH?

10:19.869 --> 10:22.538
DO YOU GET SOME EXTRA COP CREDIT
FOR BUSTING MY PARENTS, TOO,

10:22.538 --> 10:24.206
OR ARE YOU JUST NOSY?

10:24.206 --> 10:25.875
YOU GOT SOME ATTITUDE.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.002
WELL, WHERE<i> IS </i>THIS SUMMONS?

10:28.002 --> 10:30.379
WHERE ARE MY PARENTS?

10:30.379 --> 10:32.840
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

10:32.840 --> 10:34.842
WRITE DOWN YOUR MOM'S NUMBER.

10:34.842 --> 10:36.677
I'LL HAVE HER COME GET YOU.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.321
GET HIM TO THE POKEY.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.572
THIS WAY, TOUGH GUY.

10:56.572 --> 10:57.740
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

10:57.740 --> 10:59.784
UH, I GOT TO GET HER
TO THE CRIB.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.536
LISA, DO ME A FAVOR.
GET HER UP TO THE CRIB.

11:02.536 --> 11:04.246
I'LL BE RIGHT UP.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.502
THAT YOUR POT COLLAR?

11:09.502 --> 11:10.711
MM-HMM.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.380
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
CONNIE?

11:12.380 --> 11:13.923
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:13.923 --> 11:16.592
DON'T TREAT ME LIKE AN IDIOT.
THAT'S YOUR DAUGHTER.

11:16.592 --> 11:19.261
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO HER MOM,
AND THEN SHE'S OUT OF HERE.

11:23.849 --> 11:26.185
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?
SEND HER HOME.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.729
SAY THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE.
GET HER OUT NOW.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.314
AFTER I TALK TO HER MOTHER.

11:30.314 --> 11:33.192
I'M TELLING YOU, THERE'S A SAFE
DANGLING OVER YOUR HEAD.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.443
AND YOU DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING,
ANDY.

11:34.443 --> 11:35.653
I CAN HANDLE THIS.

11:44.578 --> 11:45.705
BEFORE WE START HERE,

11:45.705 --> 11:47.289
DID I NOT COME IN
LIKE A GENTLEMAN?

11:47.289 --> 11:49.417
BUT YOU KNEW YOU'D TAKE A COLLAR
IF YOU DIDN'T.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.710
STILL, I WAS RESPECTFUL,

11:50.710 --> 11:53.212
WHICH DON'T DESERVE HIM
BREATHING STINK IN MY FACE.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.631
HE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE YOU
SOME ROOM.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.300
WHERE WERE YOU THIS MORNING?

11:58.300 --> 12:00.428
TELL ME WHY,
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE I WAS.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.638
YOU KNOW DESMOND BROWNING,
SHUAN CAMPBELL -- CRIPS --

12:02.638 --> 12:04.473
GO BY SCARFACE, BIG BALLER?

12:04.473 --> 12:05.683
NOPE.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.518
SURE YOU DO, AND WORD IS

12:07.518 --> 12:09.937
THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING BUSINESS
WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.480
I BETTER HAVE A TALK
WITH THEM.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.565
SOMEBODY
ALREADY BEAT YOU TO IT.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.233
THEY WERE SHOT THIS MORNING.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.568
WHERE WERE YOU?

12:16.819 --> 12:17.987
WITH A YOUNG LADY.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.029
HER NAME AND NUMBER.

12:19.029 --> 12:21.615
WELL, YOU SEE, SHE GOT AN OLD
MAN, SO THAT AIN'T GONNA WORK.

12:21.615 --> 12:22.950
NEITHER IS LYING TO US.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.869
FELLAS,
I'M JUST A BUSINESSMAN.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.537
WHO'S GONNA SIT
IN A COURTROOM

12:26.537 --> 12:28.456
WHILE A WHITE-HAIRED
SENIOR CITIZEN

12:28.456 --> 12:30.416
POINTS DOWN FROM THE STAND
AND SAYS,

12:30.416 --> 12:32.334
"THAT'S HIM, JUDGE --
CARTER FREEMAN.

12:32.334 --> 12:34.670
I WATCHED HIM
KILL THEM TWO BOYS."

12:34.670 --> 12:38.466
THE TENANTS ARE TIRED OF YOUR
GAME, MAN, TIRED OF YOU.

12:38.466 --> 12:39.800
THE WALLS ARE CLOSING,

12:39.800 --> 12:41.051
BUT THAT DON'T MEAN YOU DON'T
HAVE OPTIONS.

12:41.051 --> 12:42.136
SUCH AS?

12:42.136 --> 12:43.929
MAYBE THIS WASN'T ABOUT
DOPE TURF.

12:43.929 --> 12:47.016
MAYBE THEY THREATENED YOU
AND YOU DEFENDED YOURSELF.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.727
NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT?

12:51.729 --> 12:54.148
YOU DON'T GET TO, CARTER.
HOW ABOUT THE TRUTH NOW?!

12:54.148 --> 12:55.024
IT'S ALL RIGHT, EDDIE.

12:55.024 --> 12:58.277
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO WAIT WHILE
HE COOKS UP SOME LOAD OF CRAP?

12:58.277 --> 12:59.403
GET HIM OUTTA MY FACE.

12:59.403 --> 13:00.362
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.

13:00.362 --> 13:01.697
BACK, EDDIE.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.452
EXCUSE ME, AM I ARRESTED?

13:06.452 --> 13:07.828
WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU
A MINUTE.

13:07.828 --> 13:08.996
I'M ARRESTED OR I'M WALKING.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.706
CARTER, WE'RE TRYING
TO HELP YOU OUT.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.249
AND I GOT A BUSINESS
TO GET BACK TO.

13:12.249 --> 13:14.460
WHICH I WILL SHUT DOWN
IN THE NEXT HOUR.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.670
YOUR DEALERS, YOUR CUSTOMERS,

13:16.670 --> 13:19.381
THEY'LL ALL BE COMING IN UNTIL
SOMEBODY DEALS YOU UP,

13:19.381 --> 13:21.550
AND THEN NOBODY HEARS YOUR SIDE
OF IT.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.135
WE THROUGH?

13:23.135 --> 13:25.846
SEE YOU ON THE STREET.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.020
REALLY GREAT.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.731
THE NEXT TIME I SAY A GUY
NEEDS TIME, YOU GIVE HIM TIME.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.192
I WAS STIRRING THINGS UP
TO GO IN FOR THE KILL.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.444
IN MY INTERVIEW,
YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.737
YOUR WORLD, PAL.

13:42.780 --> 13:43.864
LET'S GO.

13:48.869 --> 13:52.414
HE'S A LIABILITY
IN THE ROOM.

14:02.550 --> 14:03.884
LET'S GO, ACE.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.010
SPREAD 'EM.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.345
EVERYBODY HAVING FUN?

14:06.345 --> 14:07.555
DAY AT THE BEACH.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.348
GET USED TO IT
'CAUSE SHOP'S CLOSED

14:09.348 --> 14:11.350
TILL SOMEBODY DEALS UP
CARTER FREEMAN.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.685
GOOD LUCK, MONEY.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.812
"GOOD LUCK" YOU EATING ANYTHING
BUT DOG FOOD

14:14.812 --> 14:17.106
UNTIL HE'S LOCKED UP.
IS EVERYBODY HEARING ME?

14:17.106 --> 14:20.109
[ INDISTINCT
RADIO CONVERSATION ]

14:23.612 --> 14:25.281
THAT'S AROUND THE CORNER.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.782
15th SQUAD RESPONDING.

14:26.782 --> 14:30.244
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS, UH,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST HANG OUT?

14:30.244 --> 14:31.495
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.170
MICHAEL, WHAT HAPPENED?!

14:40.170 --> 14:41.171
I DON'T KNOW.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.214
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:42.214 --> 14:44.508
I WAS INSIDE
AND I HEARD A SHOT.

14:44.508 --> 14:46.010
SHE GONNA BE OKAY?

14:46.010 --> 14:47.845
15th SQUAD TO CENTRAL,

14:47.845 --> 14:52.099
PUT A RUSH ON THE BUS IN THAT
PERSON SHOT ON AVENUE D.

14:52.099 --> 14:55.477
ALL RIGHT, GET THIS GUY
BACK TO THE HOUSE.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.696
ANY WORD FROM CHRISTINE BECK,
THE GIRL'S MOM?

15:05.696 --> 15:06.822
NOTHING.

15:06.822 --> 15:08.908
I JUST GOT OFF
WITH MISSING PERSONS.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.619
DENISE CONNOR WAS REPORTED
MISSING SEPTEMBER 11th,

15:11.619 --> 15:13.621
AND SHE'S ON A LIST
OF UNRECOVERED

15:13.621 --> 15:15.706
FROM THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
ATTACK.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.166
THAT WAS THE M.E.'S OFFICE.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.293
CAUSE OF DEATH
WAS BLUNT HEAD TRAUMA.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.628
WHERE'S HER HUSBAND?

15:20.628 --> 15:23.505
HE CALLED TO SAY HE JUST MADE IT
THROUGH THE MIDTOWN TUNNEL.

15:23.505 --> 15:25.507
IS THERE A SHOT THIS GUY KILLED
HIS WIFE

15:25.507 --> 15:27.551
AND THEN STUMBLED ONTO
THE PERFECT ALIBI?

15:27.551 --> 15:31.096
SHE DEFINITELY DIDN'T DIE
IN THOSE BUILDINGS.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.641
I'M LOOKING
FOR DETECTIVE McDOWELL.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.351
MY NAME IS CHRISTINE BECK.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.811
CONNIE McDOWELL.
UH, COME THIS WAY.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.818
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN HERE
SOONER,

15:44.818 --> 15:47.279
BUT IT'S HELL
DRIVING INTO THE CITY.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.906
YOU SHOULD TRY THE TRAIN.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.117
JENNIFER'S UPSTAIRS.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.995
BEFORE I GET HER,
I'D LIKE TO KNOW

15:54.995 --> 15:57.915
IF YOU HAD ANY IDEA SHE WAS
SMOKING POT BEFORE SCHOOL.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.083
IT'S A COMPLETE SHOCK.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.876
WELL, HOW INVOLVED IN HER LIFE
ARE YOU?

16:00.876 --> 16:02.795
WE KNOW HER FRIENDS,
HER TEACHERS.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.922
SOMEONE'S THERE WHENEVER
SHE GETS HOME.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.548
PARENT OR MAID?

16:06.548 --> 16:07.758
EITHER/OR.

16:09.009 --> 16:11.095
WHAT KIND OF WORK DO YOU
AND YOUR HUSBAND DO?

16:11.095 --> 16:15.015
I DESIGN WEDDING INVITATIONS,
AND RICHARD'S IN ADVERTISING.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.266
YOU LOOK WELL OFF.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.685
WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.937
DO YOU HAVE
A STRONG RELATIONSHIP?

16:19.937 --> 16:23.482
YES. WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH JENNIFER SMOKING POT?

16:23.482 --> 16:25.150
UH, GETTING HIGH
BEFORE SCHOOL

16:25.150 --> 16:27.194
IS EITHER REBELLION
OR A CRY FOR HELP.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.405
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH
ONE APPLIES.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.865
WELL, I'D WAGER ON REBELLION.
SHE IS A TEENAGER.

16:31.865 --> 16:34.868
WHEN I BROUGHT HER IN, SHE
PROTESTED THAT IT WAS JUST WEED.

16:34.868 --> 16:36.620
WHERE DOES SHE GET
THAT ATTITUDE?

16:36.620 --> 16:38.872
I DID MY SHARE OF
EXPERIMENTATION IN COLLEGE

16:38.872 --> 16:40.457
AND SO DID RICHARD.
DIDN'T YOU?

16:41.959 --> 16:45.796
WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE HYPOCRITES
TO JENNIFER,

16:45.796 --> 16:48.674
SO WE HAVE BEEN OPEN
ABOUT IT.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.759
MAYBE SHE MISCONSTRUED.

16:50.759 --> 16:51.927
I'D SAY SO.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.722
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT DRUGS
ARE PERMITTED.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.140
WILL SHE BE PUNISHED?

16:56.140 --> 16:57.474
WE'LL TALK WITH HER.

16:57.474 --> 16:58.809
NO REAL PUNISHMENT.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.352
WOULD A FEW LASHES
SATISFY YOU?

17:00.352 --> 17:01.687
DO YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY?

17:01.687 --> 17:03.022
THESE QUESTIONS ARE INVASIVE.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.607
IF YOU APPRECIATED WHAT
A MIRACLE YOU HAVE IN THAT GIRL,

17:05.607 --> 17:07.818
YOU WOULDN'T BRISTLE AT SOMEONE
TRYING TO HELP.

17:07.818 --> 17:10.279
WHO ARE YOU TO TELL ME I DON'T
APPRECIATE MY DAUGHTER?

17:10.279 --> 17:11.613
I'M SURE YOU DO.

17:11.613 --> 17:14.867
YOU HAVE SOME NERVE
SAYING THAT TO ME.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.869
SHE'S A KID.

17:16.869 --> 17:20.205
SHE JUST MADE A MISTAKE.

17:20.205 --> 17:23.292
WELL, YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE
IT LEAD TO SOMETHING WORSE.

17:23.292 --> 17:27.004
IS SHE FREE TO GO
OR DO I NEED OUR ATTORNEY?

17:27.004 --> 17:28.881
HAVE A SEAT, MR. CONNOR.

17:31.008 --> 17:34.470
YOU, UH, SAID THIS HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH MY WIFE.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.352
FAMILIAR?

17:42.352 --> 17:44.813
THIRD ANNIVERSARY GIFT.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.191
WAS HER BODY RECOVERED?

17:47.191 --> 17:49.610
WE FOUND HER REMAINS
THIS MORNING,

17:49.610 --> 17:52.029
BUT NOT
AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.

17:53.739 --> 17:54.990
WHAT?

17:54.990 --> 17:57.409
SHE HAD BEEN BURIED
AT A CONSTRUCTION SITE.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.869
LOOKS LIKE SHE WAS MURDERED

17:58.869 --> 18:01.663
AROUND THE TIME OF THE
WORLD TRADE CENTER ATTACK.

18:01.663 --> 18:03.791
WELL, I DON'T THINK
YOU FOUND MY WIFE.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.125
UM, YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.960
THE BRACELET
WAS ON HER WRIST,

18:06.960 --> 18:09.880
AND THE MEDICAL EXAMINER
CHECKED HER DENTAL RECORDS.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.590
IT'S YOUR WIFE.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.342
WHAT --

18:13.342 --> 18:14.551
WHAT THE HELL --

18:14.551 --> 18:17.846
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON HERE?

18:17.846 --> 18:18.889
PLEASE SIT DOWN,
MR. CONNOR.

18:18.889 --> 18:21.058
NO, NO. EXCUSE ME...

18:21.058 --> 18:23.393
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
THE HELL YOU THINK
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

18:23.393 --> 18:25.896
WE'RE TRYING TO
SOLVE A HOMICIDE.
PLEASE SIT DOWN, SIR.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.272
WH-WHERE WAS SHE FOUND?

18:27.272 --> 18:28.524
NEAR STANTON STREET.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.691
HOW DID SHE DIE?

18:29.691 --> 18:31.276
BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA
TO THE HEAD.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.403
OH, GOD.
T-THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

18:33.403 --> 18:35.489
MY WIFE WAS
IN THE BUILDING.

18:35.489 --> 18:39.868
I WATCHED THE BUILDING
COME DOWN.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.787
SHE WASN'T IN IT.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.122
OH, MY GOD.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.706
WE BURIED HER.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.583
WE BURIED AN URN.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.253
WE UNDERSTAND, MR. CONNOR,

18:49.253 --> 18:52.631
BUT IF YOU COULD, PLEASE, TRY
AND HELP US OUT.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.175
I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU.

18:55.175 --> 18:58.637
CAN YOU THINK OF ANYONE WHO
MIGHT'VE DONE THIS?

18:58.637 --> 19:00.639
NO.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.850
WAS SHE HAVING TROUBLE
WITH ANYONE,

19:02.850 --> 19:04.184
MAYBE SOMEONE AT WORK?

19:04.184 --> 19:06.186
THEY ALL DIED
IN THE BUILDING --

19:06.186 --> 19:07.521
HER WHOLE COMPANY.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.566
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW YOUR WIFE?

19:10.566 --> 19:12.860
UM, THE --
THE NIGHT BEFORE.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.528
A GIRLFRIEND FROM WORK

19:14.528 --> 19:17.656
WAS HAVING A BIRTHDAY PARTY
IN THE CITY.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.242
SHE WAS STAYING OVERNIGHT
WITH HER.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.786
DID THE FRIEND DIE
IN THE ATTACK?

19:24.246 --> 19:26.832
TELL US ABOUT YOUR DAY
BEFORE IT HAPPENED.

19:26.832 --> 19:30.627
I WAS WITH MY DAUGHTER
WHO HAD THE FLU.

19:30.627 --> 19:33.297
AND, UM...

19:33.297 --> 19:36.508
I GOT A CALL FROM
MY WIFE'S BEST FRIEND,
DEBORAH,

19:36.508 --> 19:40.095
