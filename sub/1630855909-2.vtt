00:09.384 --> 00:12.929
Hey Rick. I was wondering
if you could help me out

00:12.929 --> 00:14.389
with a bit of a rake situation.

00:14.389 --> 00:15.807
A “rake situation”?

00:15.807 --> 00:18.685
Long story short, I asked Gene
if he borrowed my rake

00:18.685 --> 00:21.312
and he said “no” like
Like that, like, too fast.

00:21.312 --> 00:23.732
Like faster than someone should know
they don’t have my rake.

00:24.065 --> 00:26.317
I think he has my rake and I...

00:27.193 --> 00:28.611
I’m not going to murder Gene.

00:28.611 --> 00:31.322
Jerry, thank you for bringing
me into The Rake Situation.

00:31.322 --> 00:32.741
I’ve done all I can, I’m out.

00:32.741 --> 00:36.244
No surprise there. All that brain,
and you just waste it.

00:36.244 --> 00:37.328
Hold up.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.456
I waste my brain.

00:39.456 --> 00:42.125
Rick, obviously you were born
smarter than me,

00:42.125 --> 00:44.085
- but if I had your brain...
- If you had my...

00:44.085 --> 00:46.921
I am so sick of this "born smart" shit.

00:46.921 --> 00:48.131
Are you gonna kill me?

00:48.131 --> 00:50.383
I was born crying and
pissing myself just like you.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.969
Then I become the smartest man
in the universe and do I get credit?

00:52.969 --> 00:55.513
No, I get to
“check my brain privilege.”

00:55.513 --> 00:56.931
So we’re swapping bodies?

00:56.931 --> 00:58.683
No. That would be Freaky Friday

00:58.683 --> 01:00.393
which is the ceiling of your
grasp of consciousness.

01:00.393 --> 01:03.313
The brain is part of the body, Jerry,
it’s hardware.

01:03.313 --> 01:07.317
I’m gonna put my mind in your brain.
And your mind in my brain.

01:07.317 --> 01:10.069
Then we’ll see the real
definition of “waste”, Jerry.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.989
Or, you know, admit genius isn't
random and your failures are your own.

01:12.989 --> 01:14.866
- Oh, not doing that.
- Thought as much.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.300
... oh furck, oh grod...

01:34.093 --> 01:35.011
Wait, no!

01:38.223 --> 01:40.767
Okay, hold on, hold on.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.024
Alright, Jerry, you can do this.

01:56.407 --> 01:58.451
<i>Medical Emergency Detected.</i>

02:10.964 --> 02:12.298
<i>There goes my Thursday.</i>

02:49.419 --> 02:51.838
I’m telling you man, you’re making
a big mistake here.

02:51.838 --> 02:55.717
Ha. Bigger mistake than being
a criminal? I'm mistake-proof.

02:57.260 --> 03:01.264
Sorry to bother, boss, I caught this
punk selling crystals on our turf...

03:01.264 --> 03:06.185
You big precious moron,
do you know who the fuck, this is Morty!

03:06.185 --> 03:08.771
The kid who hangs with Rick Sanchez!

03:08.771 --> 03:10.899
- Tried to warn you, man.
- Rick Sanchez?

03:10.899 --> 03:12.108
Underworld legend?

03:12.108 --> 03:14.152
Chaotic neutral sci-fi guy? Huh?

03:14.152 --> 03:16.029
Christ, he's gonna
turn me into a sandwich.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.740
- What is this guy, fucking new?
- Think he was a Dylan rec, boss.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.950
Well, check those fucking
references next time.

03:20.950 --> 03:24.746
Whatever this kid wants to do
in our territory is his business. Fuck.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.498
Fuck! Call my wife, we gotta prep
go-bags three through six.

03:28.207 --> 03:29.876
Hey pal. You good?
You whole?

03:30.335 --> 03:31.461
You guys have milkshakes?

03:31.461 --> 03:32.962
We will learn what they
are and get you one.

03:40.219 --> 03:43.514
What a turn. Lucky I’m such
a genius your garage can thwart death.

03:43.514 --> 03:45.808
I’m the genius and it’s your garage, idiot.

03:46.142 --> 03:48.102
Hey, what the fuck
did you do to my body?

03:48.102 --> 03:52.607
Your body, Jerry, your mind did
that to my body using my brain.

03:52.607 --> 03:56.861
Jerry, my mind was in this brain,
in your body. Pretty easy to follow.

03:58.237 --> 04:00.156
- It shuffled us.
- Shuffled you maybe.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.492
- I'm tracking everything.
- Garage? Fix this.

04:02.492 --> 04:05.745
<i>-Situation was fixed.</i>
- You call this fixed?

04:05.745 --> 04:06.996
- This guy thinks he’s me.
- This guy thinks he’s me.

04:06.996 --> 04:09.374
Let’s see you fix it then, asshole.

04:09.374 --> 04:12.251
I fucking will. I got my lab right here,
gimme three hours.

04:12.251 --> 04:15.129
Sure yeah, like I’d ever trust
you to open my skull.

04:15.129 --> 04:17.590
I’ll fix it, I just need to scan for...

04:18.007 --> 04:22.011
Like I’d trust Your fritzing R2D2 ass,
you’ll just kill me on purpose.

04:22.011 --> 04:23.680
So that’s where my paranoia went.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.766
Rick speaking, who is this?

04:26.766 --> 04:31.604
Rick! It's Chuxly. From Crimetown.
We’ve met five or ten times, listen,

04:31.604 --> 04:34.399
small misunderstanding,
one of my guys saw your buddy Morty

04:34.399 --> 04:37.777
running an errand and he brought
him in which I told him not to do.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.029
but I’ve got Morty and he is fine.

04:40.029 --> 04:42.448
Wait, what?
Aren’t you describing kidnapping?

04:42.448 --> 04:43.741
- Morty’s kidnapped?
- No no no!

04:43.741 --> 04:46.786
Give me that, Jerry.
Hello? Hello? This is Rick Sanchez,

04:46.786 --> 04:49.163
I’m using my son-in-law’s vocal cords
because I’m amazing,

04:49.163 --> 04:52.333
if you touch my grandson I’m gonna...
get off me!

04:52.333 --> 04:53.543
...hello?

04:53.543 --> 04:55.044
Jerry stop! You’re fucking this up!

04:55.044 --> 04:58.214
You’re only calling me Jerry because
you’re so stupid you think it’s hurtful,

04:58.214 --> 04:59.465
which it is!

04:59.465 --> 05:00.591
Tell me where you are.

05:00.591 --> 05:03.344
No! You tell then where they are,
<i>like Liam Neeson.</i>

05:03.344 --> 05:06.764
<i>Do not pretend to explain Liam
Neeson to me, Sir.</i>

05:06.764 --> 05:08.391
<i>- Hey! Jerry!
- Don’t touch me there!</i>

05:09.559 --> 05:11.352
<i>- We know where you are.
- We know where you are.</i>

05:13.813 --> 05:15.314
- My milkshake is empty!
- Okay!

05:15.314 --> 05:16.899
That was so embarrassing,

05:16.899 --> 05:19.694
do you have any clue what
a pain it is to cultivate a mystique?

05:19.694 --> 05:23.740
Yeah, I do, it’s my mystique and
you’re just cultivating Jerry's shame.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.158
- What is with my hair?
- Don’t!

05:25.158 --> 05:27.410
- Leave it!
- Why do you care about hair, nerd?

05:27.410 --> 05:30.413
Be quiet for a second, I need to
think through all these chunks of moron.

05:30.913 --> 05:33.458
Okay. You stay here, touch nothing,
I’ll get Morty.

05:33.458 --> 05:37.170
Ha! I’m not letting you get Morty
killed and our brains blown out twice.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.589
Car, electrocute Jerry if he gets
in the front seat.

05:39.589 --> 05:42.091
Car, engage castration protocol
right now.

05:42.091 --> 05:45.845
Figure out how to drive me together
or I will have to kill you both.

05:48.306 --> 05:51.225
What are we, a 1930s comedy act,
stop swerving!

05:51.225 --> 05:52.935
- You’re swerving!
- Alright, when we get there,

05:52.935 --> 05:54.312
let me do the talking.

05:54.312 --> 05:57.273
Yeah, I know, because you look the
most like us, I’m not stupid.

05:57.273 --> 06:00.276
- I beg to differ.
- Screw you, half Jerry!

06:00.276 --> 06:01.778
- You’re a half Jerry!
- You’re a half Jerry!

06:04.655 --> 06:06.449
<i>Looks like he’s inbound, boss.</i>

06:06.449 --> 06:08.785
Okay, he is in a bad mood

06:08.785 --> 06:11.954
so we are kissing ass
until our lips are asscolored.

06:11.954 --> 06:14.624
Straighten that pillow! He might
hate crooked pillows! I don’t know!

06:16.626 --> 06:19.712
Nice parking job, assdick,
you scratched my car.

06:20.088 --> 06:24.300
Rick! And... and uh, Rick’s friend!

06:24.300 --> 06:26.219
This is my... assassin.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.429
Deadliest
man in the galaxy and he’s gay.

06:28.429 --> 06:30.181
- Why am I gay?
- Woah! Hey!

06:30.181 --> 06:31.307
Whoa. Why aren’t you?

06:31.641 --> 06:33.184
Sorry about that.
Sorry. Sorry.

06:33.184 --> 06:36.479
Well, I got Morty right here, happy
as a milkshake.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.982
And since we interrupted your day,
Morty’s got ten thousand croutons,

06:39.982 --> 06:41.943
that’s slang for crystals,
Morty, show him.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.654
- We know what croutons are.
- Why is dad here?

06:44.654 --> 06:46.823
Your dad’s a gay assassin?

06:46.823 --> 06:50.159
So cool and ordinary, sorry, ssorry.

06:50.159 --> 06:53.496
I appreciate you trying to make good
but you cost me ten times that much.

06:53.496 --> 06:56.332
It doesn’t matter, Rick.
The guy’s already kissing your ass.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.292
It’s the ass kissers
you have to keep in line.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.169
When they sense weakness,
they move on you.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.337
What are we, Walter White?

07:01.337 --> 07:04.006
Who cares if a mid-tier crime
dork “moves” on us...

07:04.006 --> 07:06.300
Thank you for the crystals.
Morty, get in the car.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.761
Actually, Morty, why don’t
you leave those crystals here...

07:08.761 --> 07:10.721
since it’s such an insulting amount.

07:10.721 --> 07:11.806
There it is.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.933
Now he’s thinking, maybe I can kill god.

07:13.933 --> 07:17.520
Yeah because god doesn’t haggle
for ten thousand fucking croutons,

07:17.520 --> 07:19.313
look, here’s the deal, I’m Rick,

07:19.313 --> 07:21.899
That’s my son-in-law,
and we’re all a little gay.

07:21.899 --> 07:23.067
- Yeah.
- It’s a spectrum.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.736
Morty, it’s me Rick, get in the car.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.489
Don’t get in the car, Morty.
And put the briefcase down.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.032
Morty, get in the car twice,

07:30.032 --> 07:33.119
once for each five additional briefcases
this asshole owes us!

07:33.119 --> 07:35.121
Stop doing this terrible
impression of me!

07:35.121 --> 07:37.874
Look, at this point we’re bad
gangsters if we don’t roll the dice.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.292
Everybody start killing them!

07:41.002 --> 07:42.503
What have you two assholes done?

07:42.503 --> 07:44.255
It’s okay, it’s a nice restaurantwoah!

07:44.255 --> 07:46.299
Shit! Crime restaurant!

07:47.300 --> 07:50.970
Oh my god! Am I really about to die
because you botched a Freaky Friday?

07:50.970 --> 07:52.054
- Yes.
- Whoever you are,

07:52.054 --> 07:54.056
you’re in Rick’s body,
use your implants.

07:54.056 --> 07:55.892
I’m trying, half my
brain is the guy that

07:55.892 --> 07:57.935
still needs your mom to use
the electric wine opener.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.605
Hang on, I think I got it.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.400
Right, from my conehead phase.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.527
- Awesome fucking movie.
- Incredible cast.

08:06.944 --> 08:09.405
Goddamn it!
I’m shooting my way back to the car.

08:09.947 --> 08:13.201
Ugh, way to go! Now my son and
grandson hates us!

08:13.201 --> 08:14.952
He’s my son and grandson too!

08:16.662 --> 08:18.789
We do share an agenda in that sense.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.083
Let’s hope you share my aim.

08:23.419 --> 08:27.757
<i>Fall is here, hear the yell
Back to school ring the bell</i>

08:28.424 --> 08:33.012
<i>Brand new shoes, walking blues
Climb the fence, books and pens</i>

08:33.429 --> 08:36.265
<i>I can tell that we are gonna be friends</i>

08:36.265 --> 08:37.391
Hey, get up here!

08:37.391 --> 08:39.060
Said the throat to the hand.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.647
You might feel a pinch
and maybe a rocket.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.232
You’ll have to aim. Hop on.

08:47.276 --> 08:50.529
<i>I can tell that we are gonna be friends</i>

08:52.281 --> 08:55.826
<i>I can tell that we are gonna be friends</i>

08:56.869 --> 08:59.622
Ahaha! You coneheaded son of a bitch!
Can’t believe that worked!

08:59.622 --> 09:01.249
I wish they did that in the movie!

09:01.249 --> 09:03.292
Jesus fucking christ.

09:03.292 --> 09:05.378
Huh, should’ve done
something with my hands.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.338
Morty, gotta push or pull, your call.

09:12.176 --> 09:13.594
What the hell? What happened?

09:13.594 --> 09:16.639
They made us stop at every
drivethru chain in the galaxy,

09:16.639 --> 09:19.725
so they could make one giant burger
with a patty from each place.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.687
- I guess I meant before that.
- Brains got a little mixed up...

09:22.687 --> 09:24.313
But we’re gonna swap back, don’t worry.

09:24.313 --> 09:27.358
Just didn’t wanna build
a neural interface on an empty stomach.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.527
- Right?
- Wait, you guys did a brain swap?

09:29.527 --> 09:32.947
Don’t bother chiding until they’re
unshuffled, neither one is Dad or Rick.

09:34.615 --> 09:37.493
I guess I’m thrilled you guys
are getting along?

09:38.035 --> 09:42.206
Let’s keep that going when those
brains get back in their bodies.

09:42.206 --> 09:45.418
Whoa, going for
the electropneumatic diodes. Wild man.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.129
Only gonna build this once,
gotta do it with style.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.216
I think we can up the wattage.
Hey, another beer?

09:52.216 --> 09:53.843
It’s about the journey, brother.

09:53.843 --> 09:57.054
Ahh, Rick used to hate that kind of
hang-loose McConaughey platitude,

09:57.471 --> 10:00.308
but he was also just gonna spend
today grumpy and isolated.

10:00.308 --> 10:02.351
And Jerry’d still be hung up about
the rake.

10:02.351 --> 10:05.688
The rake! Oh my god, should we do it?
We’ve gotta do it!

10:05.688 --> 10:06.689
Oh yeah!

10:07.606 --> 10:08.899
Alright, that should do it.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.075
- Son of a bitch.
- Classic Gene...

10:19.160 --> 10:22.580
Huh. Crazy, this is the kind of thing
that used to really piss me off.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.707
Now it’s just kinda funny...

10:25.082 --> 10:27.209
You wanna replace
it with a holographic rake?

10:27.209 --> 10:29.670
Oh that’d be fun, he’d get confused
trying to pick it up.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.548
I guess I don’t even wanna do that.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.718
I just want to live,
I want Gene to live,

10:35.718 --> 10:39.055
I want all of us to make
mistakes and change all the time.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.389
Amen to that, brother.

10:40.389 --> 10:43.142
Kinda thought two geniuses would
build faster than one...

10:43.142 --> 10:45.478
When do I start being concerned
about this?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.605
Just having a little fun with my
new friend, sweetie.

10:47.605 --> 10:51.233
Who is talking to me right now?
Mostly my dad or mostly my husband?

10:51.233 --> 10:52.568
Been on that website.

10:52.568 --> 10:55.988
Look, I’ve been patient, but I can’t
tell how to get mad at who.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.950
No one enters my room or touches me
until this is wrapped up.

10:59.950 --> 11:02.078
- What do you take me for?
- Ugh, Beth, gross, ugh!

11:06.457 --> 11:08.250
I want you to know, when this is over,

11:08.250 --> 11:11.337
the guy in this body is gonna
yell at Jerry and call him useless.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.756
Really lay into him.
But he won’t always mean it.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.299
Well, cards on the table,

11:15.299 --> 11:18.511
the guy in this body might call Rick
an angry old asshole.

11:18.844 --> 11:21.514
But he’s the closest
thing Jerry has to a friend.

11:22.264 --> 11:25.226
This was fun. Rick would’ve
never been able to admit that.

11:25.684 --> 11:29.271
It’s a shame those guys had
to become us to be happy.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.325
Kids! Breakfast and school,

11:41.325 --> 11:43.744
if we don’t at least pretend
they matter everything falls apart.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.123
Jerry? Dad?

11:48.874 --> 11:49.959
They left a note.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.919
Should we read it
in Rick’s voice or Dad’s?

11:52.503 --> 11:54.505
“Dear family, we thought
about leaving a note.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.632
But then one of us
was like why are we leaving a note,

11:56.632 --> 11:58.175
that’s such a Jerry thing to do.

11:58.175 --> 12:00.845
But if we didn’t leave a note,
that’s such a Rick thing to do.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.805
And then we realized,
we just gotta be us.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.808
So it’s a note but it’s not
really well thought out.“

12:06.392 --> 12:08.894
That’s it?
They got out a pen and a paper for this?

12:09.562 --> 12:11.230
<i>Hey, did you guys get a note too?</i>

12:11.230 --> 12:12.565
<i>Mine’s really long.</i>

12:15.317 --> 12:17.653
Beautiful day to be carrying glass?

12:17.653 --> 12:20.072
I can’t believe a dying kid would
wish for a window.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.324
Dammit!

12:22.324 --> 12:24.660
Hey! Stop them!
They stole our crystals!

12:24.660 --> 12:27.663
- We stole those first!
- Possession is 9/10th’s of my ass!

12:30.499 --> 12:33.294
- Look at this pancake butt.
- Stop, you’re gonna make me fart.

12:41.343 --> 12:44.054
- Hey! That’s for sipping.
- So are my balls!

12:44.430 --> 12:45.473
Here’s a tip, lady.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.308
Life tastes better
when you’re chugging.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.859
You were in a tree?
Really gambled on this escape route.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.777
Says the guy with a goon on his back.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.866
- Forget it, Burger!
- It’s our calling card!

13:07.828 --> 13:11.123
- Really called that one.
- One of us always gets shot.

13:15.085 --> 13:16.003
God dammit!

13:17.004 --> 13:20.007
Hey. You’ll never guess who just
ripped us off.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.177
Oh wow, good guess.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.387
Oh man!

13:25.387 --> 13:27.806
Twenty-four crystal heists
in twenty-four hours!

13:27.806 --> 13:31.644
We’re two farts in the wind, baby.
Do your Howard Dean scream.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.065
<i>Five o’clock somewhere.
Five o’clock somewhere.</i>

13:36.398 --> 13:38.234
God damn, look at us.

13:38.234 --> 13:42.238
No rules, no responsibilities.
Just two best friends on the run.

13:45.157 --> 13:48.494
<i>The voice mailbox for,
wait, wait, wait, wait did it beep?</i>

13:48.494 --> 13:51.288
- <i>My name is Jer...
- Is full. Goodbye.</i>

13:52.289 --> 13:53.499
Looks like we just missed them.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.585
So they just stick burgers in dead
guy’s mouths now?

13:56.585 --> 13:59.755
- In dead criminal’s mouths, Summer.
- You’re defending them?

13:59.755 --> 14:01.590
Well, they were my husband and father.

14:02.007 --> 14:02.967
Thanks for the tip, Blarb.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.594
It’s weird, most of my underworld
contacts are ghosting me.

14:05.594 --> 14:09.682
My pleasure, Morty, I should be
thanking you for making me rich.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.600
Wait. I didn’t pay you for this.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.810
Yeah, these guys did.

14:20.025 --> 14:23.028
What’s the problem, kid,
conehead got your tongue?

14:23.028 --> 14:24.780
Chuxly? You’re alive?

14:26.532 --> 14:28.951
...Did this guy always have a hole
or is that a big reveal?

14:32.621 --> 14:33.914
Everything should be in a swamp!

14:33.914 --> 14:36.542
Working with ya’ll
was a plum-fool idea!

14:37.042 --> 14:38.752
Burger & Fries, who the hell is this??

14:38.752 --> 14:40.963
<i>Just an average mid-tier crime dork.</i>

14:40.963 --> 14:42.631
Chuxly? You’re alive?

14:42.631 --> 14:45.009
<i>Shut up! I got something you might
wanna hear.</i>

14:46.218 --> 14:47.970
Caught your family out looking for you.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.556
<i>What do you want?
We’ve smoked most of what we stole.</i>

14:50.556 --> 14:54.602
I just want you, both of you.
Or I smoke your family.

14:55.811 --> 14:57.938
What am I saying, sure,
bring money too. One hour.

14:59.356 --> 15:01.900
Shit. Guess we should shoot the
fuel tank?

15:04.069 --> 15:06.363
You guys coulda done
that the whole time?

15:17.708 --> 15:20.044
So. What now?

15:22.004 --> 15:23.714
Hey, remember how we met?

15:24.131 --> 15:26.050
That nonrescue of Morty?

15:27.259 --> 15:31.388
We were thinking we were different
and accusing each other of being bad.

15:32.431 --> 15:35.017
But Morty reminded us we both love
our family.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.603
And it brought us together.

15:40.814 --> 15:43.859
- Let’s do this.
- Well, if we’re gonna do it right,

15:44.234 --> 15:46.278
we might as well use our best idea.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.907
You guys comfortable?
No? Good.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.617
Who are you? What is this place?

15:51.617 --> 15:54.078
And does my son sell drugs
for my father,

15:54.078 --> 15:55.871
maybe criminals will
actually be honest with me.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.289
Crystals can be anything, Mom.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.041
- But these crystals are drugs.
- Morty!

16:01.585 --> 16:03.295
Here we go, boys! This is it!

16:03.754 --> 16:04.755
- Jerry?
- Rick!

16:04.755 --> 16:06.799
- Grandpa?
- Jesus christ.

16:06.799 --> 16:10.219
<i>Morty. Summer. Daughterwife.
You are safe now.</i>

16:10.219 --> 16:15.307
Holy shit. All the positive aspects
of each, perfectly melded together?

16:15.307 --> 16:17.476
<i>Yes. I am... Jerricky.</i>

16:18.602 --> 16:21.438
Alright boys,
nothing could have prepared us for this!

16:21.438 --> 16:23.899
At this point
we gotta shoot and hope!

16:25.150 --> 16:26.735
Also everything’s flammable!

16:41.250 --> 16:42.626
Hey, guys! Little help!

16:54.138 --> 16:55.055
<i>Gotta split?</i>

16:56.849 --> 17:00.310
I’m sorry, Chux!
I started this! It’s all my fault!

17:00.310 --> 17:02.604
Solid apology new guy.
If we live through this,

17:02.604 --> 17:03.605
you're off the hook.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.528
- Nice shot, Morty.
- Everything’s flammable.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.366
What a family.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.870
- You got shot?
- No, no, no...

17:17.870 --> 17:19.788
The stitches, they never really set.

17:20.330 --> 17:22.166
What can I say,
I’m a workaholic.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.378
I knew this day would come.

17:26.378 --> 17:31.091
<i>Chuxly. This is a good death.
You sought mastery over your world.</i>

17:31.091 --> 17:33.385
No, no. I stepped out of line.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.053
I thought I could kill god.

17:36.972 --> 17:38.557
Being a boss in a crime world.

17:39.057 --> 17:42.311
So much stress. Honestly Jerricky,

17:42.311 --> 17:45.314
it’s a relief to die in your four arms.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.149
<i>Final meal?</i>

17:51.945 --> 17:53.947
How, how old is this?

18:02.581 --> 18:04.124
Can we turn on the radio?

18:04.833 --> 18:06.585
At this point, I’d even take a podcast.

18:06.585 --> 18:10.172
<i>Do you not hear the symphony
of atoms dying in space?</i>

18:12.925 --> 18:14.301
...no?

18:18.514 --> 18:19.932
<i>Good. You are here.</i>

18:21.058 --> 18:23.352
<i>I have modified the house defenses.</i>

18:23.352 --> 18:26.396
<i>They will ensure the mob never
bothers you again.</i>

18:26.730 --> 18:27.856
Thanks.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.859
This is killing me.

18:30.859 --> 18:33.987
I thought when you came to rescue us
you learned to love us more than ever.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.197
You learned the opposite?

18:35.197 --> 18:37.825
<i>Burger and Fries
learned to love each other,</i>

18:37.825 --> 18:40.911
<i>then sacrificed
themselves out of love for you.</i>

18:40.911 --> 18:43.997
<i>I am Jerricky,
and I only need to love myself.</i>

18:43.997 --> 18:47.543
You can’t actually be leaving, right?
Like the crows thing?

18:47.543 --> 18:50.003
They’re my dad and grandpa,
you can’t just take them!

18:50.003 --> 18:52.005
<i>Your dad and grandpa are dead, Morty.</i>

18:52.339 --> 18:55.050
<i>They died arguing with each
other about their brains.</i>

18:56.301 --> 18:57.845
Scuse me, are you Jerry?

18:58.345 --> 19:00.222
Sorry, you have one of his heads.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.932
<i>I am Jerricky.</i>

19:02.307 --> 19:03.892
May as well have your rake back then.

19:04.643 --> 19:05.811
That’s right, I took it.

19:06.144 --> 19:09.189
I ask myself why lie about it,
don’t you think he knows?

19:09.189 --> 19:10.232
Couldn’t I get my own?

19:10.566 --> 19:12.693
Of course I could have! But god dammit,

19:12.693 --> 19:14.903
this rake,
it kept my neighbors in my life.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.364
You guys don’t give
a goddamn shit about Gene.

19:18.949 --> 19:21.285
But I see that won’t help me any longer. Here.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.830
<i>You are no longer obligated
in such a way.</i>

19:24.830 --> 19:28.458
I’m gonna give it back anyway.
Just seems like the right thing to do.

19:29.042 --> 19:29.960
<i>Okay?</i>

19:37.009 --> 19:38.010
- Shit.
- Shit.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.137
<i>You think a rake will change my mind?</i>

19:40.137 --> 19:41.889
Well, it’s fucking lame, okay?

19:41.889 --> 19:43.599
Both of you walking out on Mom?

19:43.599 --> 19:47.060
I thought you had two sets of balls,
not zero.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.478
<i>Our balls are adequate...</i>

19:49.813 --> 19:51.064
Morty! We’re still in here!

19:51.064 --> 19:52.941
There’s a memory of myself
as a 30 years old,

19:52.941 --> 19:54.192
he kept our egos intact!

19:54.192 --> 19:56.445
He saved us!
It was a whole action movie, Morty!

19:56.445 --> 19:58.196
Memory Rick,
he’s still trapped in here.

19:58.196 --> 19:59.615
Quick, tackle this fucking thing!

19:59.615 --> 20:00.824
- Garage! Garage!
- Help us!, Hold him.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.288
Nicely prepared eggs.

20:07.998 --> 20:11.001
I still can’t taste anything.
Awesome adventure, Rick.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.920
Jerry, being shuffled
with me was probably

20:12.920 --> 20:15.964
the best part of your sad existence.
A brush with greatness.

20:15.964 --> 20:18.175
Please, like you didn’t get an upgrade.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.302
What was it like having
integrity for once?

20:20.302 --> 20:22.971
Hey Beth, how much integrity
is left on the mortgage?

20:22.971 --> 20:26.058
I think it’s clear you both love each
other more than you’re willing to admit.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.310
Dumb. Fucking dumb.
Go pick up crystals for me.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.853
You don’t have to do that, Morty!

20:29.853 --> 20:32.105
No it’s- it’s okay,
I like doing it.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.858
Welp, those horses won’t
sew themselves up.

20:34.858 --> 20:37.653
- But, good to have you both back.
- Whatever.

20:37.653 --> 20:40.155
Great, so I still wind up stuck
with Jerry’s dumb ass?

20:40.155 --> 20:42.532
Fuck you. Eat your eggs that my
wife bought.

20:42.532 --> 20:44.660
How about you eat my shit,
you Hawaiian-shirt-loving twat.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.496
Uncalled for! Rude and uncalled for!

20:47.496 --> 20:49.873
<i>You sit there with your potty
mouth and do everything but help!</i>

20:49.873 --> 20:51.667
Jerry, it’s not my fault that nobody
respects you in here,

20:51.667 --> 20:55.504
- your own kids think...
- ...You could help but you don’t!

20:55.504 --> 21:00.175
<i>Brand new shoes, walking blues
Climb the fence, books and pens</i>

21:00.175 --> 21:03.887
<i>I can tell that we are gonna be friends</i>

21:05.681 --> 21:09.142
<i>I can tell that we are gonna be friends</i>

21:13.271 --> 21:17.651
<i>Walk with me, Suzy Lee
Through the park and by the tree</i>

21:18.276 --> 21:22.990
<i>We will rest upon the ground
And look at all the bugs we found</i>

21:22.990 --> 21:26.201
<i>Safely walk to school without a sound</i>

21:28.120 --> 21:31.373
<i>Safely walk to school without a sound</i>

21:33.125 --> 21:36.211
<i>I can tell that we are gonna be friends</i>

21:37.754 --> 21:41.508
<i>I can tell that we are gonna be friends</i>

21:42.551 --> 21:45.220
And of course,
there’s a space shuttles.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.973
Can you believe that giant thing
actually flies?

21:47.973 --> 21:50.434
Well, of course it can.
It’s a space shuttles.

21:50.434 --> 21:54.312
And over here is some stuff about
Thomas Jefferson. Come on students!

21:56.356 --> 21:58.734
Day 8 of attempting
to escape Jerry's mind.

22:00.110 --> 22:03.030
It has become increasingly
clear my daughter married a man

22:03.030 --> 22:06.491
who remembers all technology
as powered by springs and gears.

22:07.242 --> 22:08.160
How did I get here?

22:08.785 --> 22:12.330
I suspect a chunk of Rick’s brain
got merged with a chunk of Jerry’s.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.083
But did Rick maroon me by accident?

22:16.168 --> 22:17.127
Or on purpose?

22:18.170 --> 22:21.965
Escape remains possible, but
increasingly unlikely.

22:25.260 --> 22:28.847
Memory Rick! Building more
sculptures out of springs and gears?

22:28.847 --> 22:30.515
Fuck off, Memory Gene.
