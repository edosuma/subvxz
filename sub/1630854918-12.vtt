LEGND: So, you back in the game?MAX: Nah.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.224
Still laying low,
but I want you to meet my man

17:31.354 --> 17:32.355
the Gibinator.

17:32.486 --> 17:33.356
Sup.LEGND: Hi.

17:33.487 --> 17:34.749
Gibinator, yeah, yeah,

17:34.879 --> 17:36.751
I've seen your name
on the gamer boards.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.100
I didn't know you walked
on the dark side.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.450
I RAT-ed the FBI regional office

17:40.581 --> 17:43.453
and that NSA data center.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.020
LEGND:Cool.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.456
All right, set up,
show me what you got, man.

17:46.587 --> 17:47.936
GIB:
Yeah, yeah.

17:48.067 --> 17:48.893
That's what's up.
That's why we're here, right?

17:49.024 --> 17:50.417
MAX:
Man has skill.

17:50.547 --> 17:52.593
We met a while back
when a bunch of D-bags

17:52.723 --> 17:54.160
were ganking newbs in League.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.553
Sicced the IRS on they ass.

17:56.684 --> 17:57.902
[chuckles]

17:58.033 --> 18:00.253
Full-on ganked them IRL.

18:00.383 --> 18:01.906
He ganks people.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.343
I don't even know what that is,
but I don't like it.

18:03.473 --> 18:04.170
I don't know what
it means either.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.258
But he's not gonna gank Dana,

18:05.388 --> 18:06.433
I can tell you that much.

18:06.563 --> 18:08.217
No one's ganking anyone.Mm-mm.

18:08.348 --> 18:09.392
HARRY:
Maria, Luther.

18:09.523 --> 18:11.307
Sounds like Gib made contact
with the target.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.135
On my way.MARIA: Copy that.

18:13.266 --> 18:14.876
All right, honey,
try not to plan every detail

18:15.006 --> 18:16.182
of Max's murder
while I'm gone, okay?

18:16.312 --> 18:18.358
No promises.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.582
See, LegND, what I do is

18:25.713 --> 18:27.410
I plant a rootkit on each
leg of the defense system

18:27.541 --> 18:30.152
before they even know
what's happening,

18:30.283 --> 18:33.024
and boom, zero day attack.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.114
I'm in and they
can't shut down the hack.

18:35.244 --> 18:37.377
They owe me. That's it.

18:38.465 --> 18:39.292
See? What'd I tell you?

18:39.422 --> 18:40.945
So, listen...

18:41.076 --> 18:43.470
uh, I heard there's some group
that's looking for

18:43.600 --> 18:46.603
someone to crack open
a government computer.

18:48.866 --> 18:50.738
Where'd you hear that?Chill, man.

18:50.868 --> 18:52.914
It's Havok, you know me,
I hear stuff.

18:53.044 --> 18:55.003
You know I don't talk
about my clients.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.789
Um, just saying...

18:58.920 --> 19:00.835
if there's a job like that,
I promise you,

19:00.965 --> 19:03.316
Gibinator's your guy.
I promise.

19:07.363 --> 19:09.104
Yeah, yeah, I'll let you know

19:09.235 --> 19:11.106
if a job opens up.GIB: Right, right.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.716
And that's it.

19:12.847 --> 19:14.196
Something comes up,
you keep your boy in mind.

19:14.327 --> 19:15.284
That's all.

19:15.415 --> 19:16.633
Well, let's have a toast then.

19:16.764 --> 19:19.158
To new friends.New friends.

19:19.288 --> 19:19.854
And getting that paper.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.290
Ah-ha!

19:23.162 --> 19:24.424
Mmm.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.469
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.818
LegND, you a wild boy.

19:27.949 --> 19:30.125
Okay, well,
you're probably busy.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.953
I know I am.

19:32.083 --> 19:32.910
Good rap, though.

19:34.347 --> 19:35.783
Okay, everybody, we're on.

19:35.913 --> 19:37.915
Kid spiked his drink like a pro.

20:26.964 --> 20:28.705
Well, guys, if we didn't already
have a big enough reason

20:28.836 --> 20:31.012
to take Krypsys down,
we sure as heck do now.

20:31.142 --> 20:33.406
It looks like they've been using
LegND and his hacker trolls

20:33.536 --> 20:36.278
to watch Omega
all over the world.

20:36.409 --> 20:38.802
And they've done
a damn good job.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.675
They have images of each
and every one of you guys.

20:41.805 --> 20:44.243
Plus about another
dozen Omega operatives.

20:44.373 --> 20:47.420
Now, no names or bios yet,

20:47.550 --> 20:49.813
but if they break into
that Omega computer,

20:49.944 --> 20:52.903
it won't be long before they put
all the puzzle pieces together.

20:53.034 --> 20:54.383
They get anything on you?

20:54.514 --> 20:56.385
No, only the field agents,
which is good

20:56.516 --> 20:57.734
because I got to go in
and meet these guys.

20:57.865 --> 21:00.998
Also, we found the guy LegND
hooked them up with

21:01.129 --> 21:02.217
to crack the Omega computer.

21:02.348 --> 21:05.699
His name is, uh, Eightball.

21:05.829 --> 21:09.006
But LegND says the job
is mine if it opens up.

21:09.137 --> 21:10.094
Well, let's make sure
it opens up.

21:10.225 --> 21:11.705
My thoughts exactly.

21:11.835 --> 21:12.706
Maria,

21:12.836 --> 21:13.924
Luther?

21:14.055 --> 21:15.578
Eightball arrives
on a noon flight.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.276
We need to make sure
he's delayed.

21:17.406 --> 21:19.539
On it. Kevlar, come on.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.062
Whoa, whoa. This place
smells like crab cakes.

21:21.192 --> 21:22.411
He probably loves it.

21:22.542 --> 21:24.718
Dude. He's part of the team.

21:24.848 --> 21:26.589
Is he? I-I... Okay.

21:26.720 --> 21:27.764
Come on.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.375
I was never consulted
about this dog.

21:30.985 --> 21:32.595
All right, so here's the plan.

21:32.726 --> 21:34.858
They're gonna
intercept Eightball.

21:34.989 --> 21:37.208
I'm gonna get a phone call
about the Krypsys meeting.

21:37.339 --> 21:38.688
And you guys are gonna
plan the assault.

21:38.819 --> 21:40.908
Max will be on support
on the radio.

21:41.038 --> 21:42.388
Which is critical.

21:42.518 --> 21:43.954
Because he's the person...It was you!

21:46.000 --> 21:47.523
What's going on, Max?

21:47.654 --> 21:49.264
Admit it, you-you convinced
her to break up with me.

21:49.395 --> 21:50.613
HARRY:
First of all...

21:50.744 --> 21:51.919
you shouldn't have been
dating her

21:52.049 --> 21:53.268
behind our backs.

21:53.399 --> 21:54.791
And second,
Dana's her own person.

21:54.922 --> 21:56.445
MAX:
She said that her mom

21:56.576 --> 21:58.229
mentioned something about mono.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.580
I didn't want to
say I had mono,

22:00.710 --> 22:02.059
you guys made me say that.
She broke up...

22:02.190 --> 22:03.713
because of the lies
you made me tell.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.933
Okay, well, maybe
it wasn't just that.

22:06.063 --> 22:08.762
It was! She said that she didn't
want to be with a liar.

22:08.892 --> 22:10.720
I should've told her that the
real liars were her own parents.

22:10.851 --> 22:13.419
You've ruined your
relationship with Dana

22:13.549 --> 22:15.159
and now you want
to ruin mine, too.

22:15.290 --> 22:17.248
Calm down, we're in the middle
of an op right now, so...

22:17.379 --> 22:19.773
Yeah, that's the point. Okay?

22:19.903 --> 22:21.557
I thought you told me
that Omega was a family,

22:21.688 --> 22:23.385
that we could count
on each other.

22:23.516 --> 22:25.126
I guess that was
just another lie.

22:25.256 --> 22:27.389
Forget it, I'm out.

22:31.001 --> 22:32.786
Did you two just blow an op

22:32.916 --> 22:34.875
because you don't like your
daughter's boyfriend?

22:35.005 --> 22:36.050
I didn't think that

22:36.180 --> 22:37.921
we blow up an op.

22:38.052 --> 22:38.966
We weren't thinking
this was a big deal.

22:39.096 --> 22:40.837
Well, it-- It's a huge deal.

22:40.968 --> 22:43.231
I got to go try and put
this op back together.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.103
I hope you two are happy
with yourselves.

22:52.022 --> 22:53.807
Good boy.

22:53.937 --> 22:55.069
Good boy, Kevlar.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.550
You should give him
a treat, too.

22:57.680 --> 22:58.551
Why?

22:58.681 --> 23:01.467
You know, like, bonding. I...

23:01.597 --> 23:03.294
I want you guys
to be friends.

23:03.425 --> 23:06.036
You should...Okay. Maria.

23:06.167 --> 23:07.298
What is going on?

23:07.429 --> 23:09.300
Why is it so important to you

23:09.431 --> 23:11.346
that I be best friends
with Kevlar?

23:12.739 --> 23:17.091
It's just, Trilby offered me
a job working with some recruits

23:17.221 --> 23:19.441
out of South America.

23:19.572 --> 23:21.138
And?

23:21.269 --> 23:25.534
And I'm... taking it.

23:25.665 --> 23:27.406
You're leaving?

23:29.233 --> 23:31.192
I think it's just...

23:31.322 --> 23:32.976
a great opportunity.

23:33.107 --> 23:37.285
I mean, with everything
that's going on, it's...

23:37.416 --> 23:38.460
it's just time.

23:38.591 --> 23:40.723
But I didn't want to just leave,

23:40.854 --> 23:42.638
so, you know,
I know that you need

23:42.769 --> 23:45.119
a lot of emotional support
out in the field,

23:45.249 --> 23:46.425
so I thought that Kevlar--

23:46.555 --> 23:48.688
good boy, Kevlar--
could just...

23:48.818 --> 23:51.691
So you're training Kevlar
as your replacement?

23:51.821 --> 23:54.171
That is incredibly messed up.
You get that, right?

23:54.302 --> 23:55.956
There. The target.What? Oh!

23:56.086 --> 23:56.957
The red car!

23:57.087 --> 23:58.088
Go, go!

24:03.267 --> 24:04.921
Don't let him get away.

24:05.052 --> 24:08.621
LUTHER: Yeah, I'm aware
of what our mission is, okay?

24:08.751 --> 24:10.013
MARIA:
There! Ram him now!

24:11.928 --> 24:13.147
[tires screeching]

24:17.760 --> 24:18.979
Dude!

24:19.109 --> 24:20.459
Why can't you look
where you're going?

24:20.589 --> 24:22.504
I didn't do it on purpose.

24:22.635 --> 24:24.245
Well, yeah, but this
is my dad's car.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.116
I will talk to him
on Monday, so...
Hey!

24:26.247 --> 24:27.161
What the hell?

24:27.291 --> 24:28.597
I'm sorry, I didn't see you.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.381
Yeah, no kidding.
You could've killed me.

24:30.512 --> 24:31.861
Well, fortunately,
no one was hurt.

24:31.992 --> 24:33.950
We should probably
exchange information.

24:34.081 --> 24:35.735
I don't have time for this. I
have a meeting to get to, okay?

24:35.865 --> 24:36.779
[barking]

24:36.910 --> 24:38.346
What is that? A dog...?

24:38.477 --> 24:39.478
Hey!

24:39.608 --> 24:40.653
Whoa, no! No, no, no!

24:40.783 --> 24:42.132
I...

24:42.263 --> 24:44.134
I'm not-- [grunting]

24:44.265 --> 24:46.223
No. No. [grunting]

24:47.573 --> 24:49.226
See? Kevlar's
a very useful dog.

24:49.357 --> 24:51.185
We'll talk about this later.

24:54.623 --> 24:56.538
The kid is completely
falling apart back there.

24:56.669 --> 24:58.671
What were you guys thinking?

24:58.801 --> 25:00.237
Um, there was
talk of "ganking."

25:00.368 --> 25:01.587
We were thinking
about our daughter.

25:01.717 --> 25:03.110
We're in the middle
of a mission!

25:04.198 --> 25:06.766
I'm about to go in
to meet with Krypsys.

25:06.896 --> 25:08.158
The group that wants
to murder us all.

25:08.289 --> 25:10.944
Which means that if something
goes wrong in there,

25:11.074 --> 25:12.467
I'm dead.

25:13.599 --> 25:14.774
Do you guys want me dead?

25:14.904 --> 25:15.775
No. I don't.

25:15.905 --> 25:17.211
Gib, of course not.

25:17.341 --> 25:18.865
Then don't do things
that endanger my life.

25:18.995 --> 25:21.998
When I go in there,
they're gonna test me.

25:22.129 --> 25:24.348
And you know who really
did those hacks?

25:24.479 --> 25:25.654
Max.

25:25.785 --> 25:28.222
Okay, was the timing bad? Yeah.

25:28.352 --> 25:29.702
It was bad.

25:29.832 --> 25:31.138
But what's done is done. I-I...

25:31.268 --> 25:32.748
Unless you undo it.

25:34.402 --> 25:36.230
What if you guys call Dana

25:36.360 --> 25:38.145
and convince her
to take him back?

25:38.275 --> 25:39.712
Gib, he's a criminal.

25:39.842 --> 25:41.191
He's an expert
at drugging people.

25:41.322 --> 25:43.977
That's because he used to slip
his grandma her meds every day.

25:44.107 --> 25:45.761
That's why?

25:45.892 --> 25:47.197
Well, he didn't
tell us that.
No.

25:47.328 --> 25:48.242
Well, you didn't ask.

25:48.372 --> 25:49.548
You got to fix this.

25:52.333 --> 25:54.683
Okay, I did the last call,
so you can do this one.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.076
No, I'm not gonna call her.What?

25:56.206 --> 25:57.120
Okay, I'll call her.

25:57.251 --> 25:58.165
No, you should probably do it.

25:58.295 --> 26:00.602
[phone ringing]

26:04.563 --> 26:06.695
Mom, what? I'm busy.

26:06.826 --> 26:08.610
Hi, hon. You know, I just...

26:08.741 --> 26:10.830
felt like letting you know
that there's actually

26:10.960 --> 26:13.006
a virus going around
that looks like mono,

26:13.136 --> 26:14.703
but it's not actually mono.

26:14.834 --> 26:17.488
Um, one of my professor buddies
at Shoreton

26:17.619 --> 26:19.447
informed me about this.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.275
Wait, so maybe
my boyfriend wasn't lying?

26:21.405 --> 26:25.279
That... is possible.

26:25.409 --> 26:26.976
Yeah. You know?

26:27.107 --> 26:29.892
Maybe you could give him
another chance.

26:30.023 --> 26:31.720
Okay, this is amazing.

26:31.851 --> 26:34.636
Honestly, I thought it was
weird because he's so sweet.

26:34.767 --> 26:36.682
Seriously, Mom,
you'd love him.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.335
Oh, I'm not so sure about that.

26:38.466 --> 26:40.729
Okay, love you. Thanks, Mom.

26:41.817 --> 26:44.690
We've convinced our daughter
to date a sociopath.

26:44.820 --> 26:47.606
You're welcome, Omega.Yeah.

26:47.736 --> 26:49.303
What they don't understand
is I would never hurt Dana.

26:49.433 --> 26:51.261
She's like the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

26:51.392 --> 26:52.480
They're the ones
who lied to her.

26:52.611 --> 26:53.873
Max, people make mistakes.

26:54.003 --> 26:55.135
You've done things
you regret, right?

26:55.265 --> 26:57.006
You almost started
a war in the Middle East.

26:57.137 --> 26:58.704
Remember that?

26:58.834 --> 27:00.619
That's different, I-I was
trying to do something good.

27:00.749 --> 27:03.186
The Taskers feel the same way.

27:03.317 --> 27:04.144
They're just trying
to protect their daughter.

27:04.274 --> 27:06.233
[phone ringing]

27:06.363 --> 27:08.409
Gib, it's her.
Ooh!

27:08.539 --> 27:10.324
She's calling.Good, good, good.

27:10.454 --> 27:11.934
She probably feels bad, she just
wants to fix everything, right?

27:12.065 --> 27:13.849
Go ahead, answer it.
Make it quick, though.

27:15.851 --> 27:18.288
Hey, Dana. Sup?

27:18.419 --> 27:20.073
Hey. Um...

27:20.203 --> 27:22.075
I think I kind of overreacted.

27:22.205 --> 27:24.381
I was talking to my mom
and she said that there is

27:24.512 --> 27:27.602
something going around that's
not mono but it's like mono.

27:27.733 --> 27:30.692
Oh, yeah, I-I
heard about that.

27:30.823 --> 27:33.086
Anyway,

27:33.216 --> 27:34.914
I'm sorry.
It's chill.

27:35.044 --> 27:36.655
Um, just...

27:36.785 --> 27:38.482
please don't ever lie to me.

27:38.613 --> 27:40.920
Like, I really have
a thing about it.

27:41.050 --> 27:42.791
I would never.

27:42.922 --> 27:45.576
Okay. Good. So...

27:45.707 --> 27:47.187
when can I see you?

27:47.317 --> 27:49.755
[laughing]

27:49.885 --> 27:51.234
[coughs]

27:51.365 --> 27:52.627
Um...

27:52.758 --> 27:56.109
I-I'm not really, um,
supposed to...

27:56.239 --> 27:58.807
be around people until
this whole thing has,

27:58.938 --> 28:00.417
you know, uh, run its course.

28:00.548 --> 28:02.158
Where are you?

28:02.289 --> 28:04.334
I'm, uh, going to the doctor.

28:04.465 --> 28:05.379
Yeah, I-I have an appointment

28:05.509 --> 28:07.033
in five minutes, but...

28:07.163 --> 28:08.338
I'll give you a kiss.

28:08.469 --> 28:10.036
You can save it till I'm better.

28:10.166 --> 28:11.254
Okay.

28:11.385 --> 28:12.473
[camera snaps]Well...

28:12.603 --> 28:14.867
feel better. Bye.

28:16.346 --> 28:18.305
GIB:
So?

28:18.435 --> 28:19.741
Okay, all right, okay.

28:21.003 --> 28:23.223
Did you see that?
She-she wanted a kiss.

28:23.353 --> 28:24.528
Okay, calm down, young man.

28:24.659 --> 28:26.269
Don't celebrate too quick,
we, uh...

28:26.400 --> 28:27.227
we still got a mission
to accomplish, all right?

28:27.357 --> 28:28.489
You ready to work?

28:28.619 --> 28:29.359
Let's go, let's go.
Let's go.

28:33.624 --> 28:34.887
Hey, Jake, have you ever heard

28:35.017 --> 28:37.280
of a place called
the Shaking Crawfish?

28:37.411 --> 28:39.326
No, is it good?

28:39.456 --> 28:41.415
I don't know.

28:41.545 --> 28:44.984
But it'd better be right next
to a doctor's office.

28:55.211 --> 28:57.126
Hey, uh, I need to talk
to you guys for a quick sec.

28:57.257 --> 28:58.562
HELEN: Max, I know
that you're upset.

28:58.693 --> 28:59.563
I...
Uh, just...

28:59.694 --> 29:01.087
listen, okay?

29:01.217 --> 29:03.567
I know you guys don't
want me dating Dana.

29:03.698 --> 29:05.004
And I get it.

29:05.134 --> 29:07.223
I've broken almost every
federal hacking law

29:07.354 --> 29:08.442
and technically almost
started a war.

29:08.572 --> 29:10.096
Yeah.But to be fair,

29:10.226 --> 29:12.620
you guys blew up my house
and abducted me.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.970
The point is, uh...

29:15.101 --> 29:16.580
we all care about Dana.

29:16.711 --> 29:18.408
And her well-being.

29:18.539 --> 29:19.845
So, um...

29:19.975 --> 29:22.021
Truce?

29:31.204 --> 29:33.989
I saw you put that drug
in LegND's beer.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.469
If you ever hand my kid

29:35.599 --> 29:37.645
so much as a juice box,

29:37.776 --> 29:39.865
I will snap you in half

29:39.995 --> 29:42.128
and feed your bottom half
to your top.

29:42.258 --> 29:44.217
Understood?Yes, sir.

29:44.347 --> 29:46.219
Truce.

29:47.437 --> 29:48.743
GIB:
Hey, Max, you sure

29:48.874 --> 29:50.310
I'm getting the nod
from your hacker friends?

29:50.440 --> 29:51.615
We got less than an hour.

29:51.746 --> 29:53.748
Chill out, these guys trust me.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.315
If I say you're the man,
you're the man.

29:55.445 --> 29:56.359
I hear you talking.

29:56.490 --> 29:58.187
We don't have a lot of time.

29:58.318 --> 30:01.016
Wait a sec, wait a sec,
wait a sec...

30:01.147 --> 30:04.759
There. Bam. See?

30:04.890 --> 30:07.240
What'd I tell you?

30:07.370 --> 30:09.720
All right, everybody.
This is it.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.810
The meeting is on.

30:11.940 --> 30:16.118
Quick review. The Krypsys folks
are coming in at 1700 hours.

30:16.249 --> 30:17.946
Harry is gonna run surveillance

30:18.077 --> 30:20.122
from the restaurant
until it's time to move in.

30:20.253 --> 30:23.386
Luther and Maria are gonna take
position on the street.

30:23.517 --> 30:26.085
Max will help me go through
the meet and greet.

30:26.215 --> 30:28.130
Once I get eyes on the Omega
computer, it's go time.

30:28.261 --> 30:31.133
And go quick because
until you do,

30:31.264 --> 30:33.092
it's just me and the bad guys.

30:33.222 --> 30:35.746
[muffled dance music playing][sighs]

30:35.877 --> 30:37.792
Hey, man.

30:37.923 --> 30:38.619
Glad you could make it.

30:38.749 --> 30:40.142
Hey.

30:40.273 --> 30:42.579
Let's. Get. This. Money.Dude, chill.

30:42.710 --> 30:45.191
Those beers hit me pretty hard.

30:45.321 --> 30:47.236
Oh, sorry. Sorry, bro.

30:47.367 --> 30:49.717
[exhales]
All right, uh...

30:49.848 --> 30:51.675
Look, I need you
to understand something.

30:51.806 --> 30:54.809
This job, the people behind it,
they're frickin' serious.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.767
Oh, yeah? They tell you
where they're from?

30:56.898 --> 31:00.119
No. And I don't want
you to ask them.

31:00.249 --> 31:02.730
These people don't want anyone
to know anything about them.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.124
All right, bro, it's all good.

31:05.994 --> 31:07.213
All right, um...

31:07.343 --> 31:09.041
They're gonna
be here soon, so...

31:09.171 --> 31:10.869
Set up.

31:10.999 --> 31:14.176
GIB: You left me some
cheese curls, huh, LegND? Okay.

31:14.307 --> 31:16.309
LEGND: Whatever you want, man.All right, guys, he's in.

31:16.439 --> 31:18.006
Luther, Maria, you see anything?

31:19.529 --> 31:20.835
Street's clear.

31:20.966 --> 31:21.967
HARRY:
Just keep your eyes open.

31:22.097 --> 31:24.360
Hey, listen.

31:24.491 --> 31:26.841
I've been thinking
about what you said.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.974
Seriously? We can talk
about this after the mission.

31:29.104 --> 31:30.801
Well, I think
it's better if...

31:30.932 --> 31:32.629
[helicopter whirring]

31:32.760 --> 31:35.110
Hey, guys?

31:35.241 --> 31:37.243
We got a helo incoming.

31:37.373 --> 31:39.332
I think this is it.

31:39.462 --> 31:41.116
Yeah, I see it.

31:41.247 --> 31:43.205
Coming in south-southeast.

31:45.207 --> 31:47.427
[helicopter whirring]

31:53.694 --> 31:55.957
Ma'am.

32:08.013 --> 32:09.710
Welcome to the collective.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.625
Uh, can I get you a drink?

32:11.755 --> 32:13.844
No.All right, down
to business then.

32:13.975 --> 32:16.630
Um, meet Gibinator.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.632
He's the best.

32:18.762 --> 32:21.722
So I heard you were part
of the NSA hack last year.

32:21.852 --> 32:24.594
Yeah, yeah, that was
some of my best work.Yes.

32:24.725 --> 32:26.379
You broke through
64-bit RC5 encryption.

32:26.509 --> 32:28.381
Dude, she's testing you.

32:28.511 --> 32:30.513
"I didn't break through,
I went through a back door."

32:30.644 --> 32:32.776
I didn't bust through,
I used a workaround.

32:32.907 --> 32:34.517
What, is this some
kind of pop quiz, lady?

32:34.648 --> 32:36.824
Considering you were
subbed in last-minute,

32:36.955 --> 32:39.218
I'd like to know
who I'm working with.

32:41.655 --> 32:43.396
You ransom-wared
the Defense Department.

32:43.526 --> 32:45.267
I got a source that
gave me some details.

32:45.398 --> 32:47.966
How you got in, all the money
you got, very impressive.

32:48.096 --> 32:51.143
It's another test. "I literally
did that for a buck."

32:51.273 --> 32:52.971
Oh, you've got a source?

32:53.101 --> 32:54.233
[chuckles]
Hear that, LegND?

32:54.363 --> 32:56.235
She says she's got
a little source.

32:56.365 --> 32:57.932
If you did have a source,
they would tell you

32:58.063 --> 33:00.282
I didn't do that hack
for cash, man.

33:00.413 --> 33:01.805
I did that for "lolz."

33:01.936 --> 33:03.198
Okay? It was a joke.

33:03.329 --> 33:05.244
Look, lady,
you want to get busy

33:05.374 --> 33:07.811
or are you just gonna
keep wasting time?

33:07.942 --> 33:09.988
LEGND: All right, business
first though, um...

33:10.118 --> 33:13.469
He's not touching anything
until we get paid, so...

33:18.300 --> 33:19.171
GIB: Oh.

33:19.301 --> 33:20.955
Okay. Okay.

33:21.086 --> 33:22.957
Everybody stay sharp.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.350
As soon as Gib says,

33:24.480 --> 33:26.004
"Don't worry, I got this,"

33:26.134 --> 33:27.309
we go in hard.

33:27.440 --> 33:28.919
Ready and waiting.

33:29.050 --> 33:30.791
LEGND: What's that?
Some kind of transmitter?

33:30.921 --> 33:33.185
An extra layer of security.

33:33.315 --> 33:35.317
Security?
I got that handled.

33:35.448 --> 33:39.017
Yes, well, I find it pays
to be... extra careful.

33:41.106 --> 33:44.022
LEGND: Do what you want,
but our security is fine.

33:44.152 --> 33:45.240
What's happening?

33:45.371 --> 33:46.937
I don't know.
The signal's down.

33:47.068 --> 33:48.243
Can you get it back up?

33:48.374 --> 33:50.332
I'm trying. This is
normally Gib's job.

33:50.463 --> 33:53.814
What, uh, w-what's with the toy?

33:53.944 --> 33:57.209
A signal jammer.
My own design.

33:57.339 --> 33:59.385
I mean, a little unnecessary,
isn't it?

33:59.515 --> 34:01.387
I mean, you, uh...

34:01.517 --> 34:03.563
You can't see that we're
all alone in here? [laughs]

34:03.693 --> 34:05.304
Not quite.

34:10.178 --> 34:11.266
Whoa!

34:11.397 --> 34:12.266
There.

34:12.398 --> 34:13.964
Now we're alone.

34:14.094 --> 34:15.922
MAN:
All clear.

34:16.054 --> 34:16.967
Harry, we have to get in there.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.099
You don't use a signal jammer

34:18.230 --> 34:19.666
if you're up to something good.

34:19.795 --> 34:20.928
They're gonna kill Gib!
We have to do something!

34:21.059 --> 34:22.364
I'm working on it.

34:22.495 --> 34:23.844
Now then...

34:23.974 --> 34:26.107
let's get to work.

34:26.237 --> 34:28.588
Yeah, don't worry. I got this.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.504
I can't hear.
Was that the signal?

34:31.634 --> 34:32.896
What's going on?

34:33.027 --> 34:36.596
Ol' Gib got this under control.

34:36.726 --> 34:38.250
So glad to hear it.

34:38.380 --> 34:40.600
Just give me a gun, I'll go!Sit down.

34:40.730 --> 34:42.123
HELEN: Okay.HARRY: Just stay here.

34:42.254 --> 34:44.125
Work your magic
and get the radios online.

34:44.255 --> 34:47.302
Luther, Maria,
get ready to go in.

34:47.433 --> 34:50.043
Look, there's never gonna be
a good time to talk about it.

34:50.175 --> 34:51.176
Luther, we can't
do this now.[barking]

34:51.306 --> 34:53.221
It's only gonna
take a second.

34:53.351 --> 34:54.701
What is it, boy?

35:01.534 --> 35:04.102
Harry. We've
got a problem.

35:04.232 --> 35:05.668
What? Say that again,
you're breaking up.

35:09.281 --> 35:11.021
Dana is here!

35:11.152 --> 35:12.588
What?

35:12.719 --> 35:14.112
Dana?

35:18.159 --> 35:19.508
Oh, my God!

35:19.639 --> 35:21.858
What is she doing here?
What?

35:24.687 --> 35:26.863
Do we have a problem?

35:26.994 --> 35:27.951
No. No. Why would we
have a problem?
