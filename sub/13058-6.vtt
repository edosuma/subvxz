I never seen him before --

18:31.845 --> 18:33.611
-What was his name?
-I don't know.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.279
Some tourist.
Said he'd been in Venice

18:35.281 --> 18:37.248
for two days and already
had his wallet stolen.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.083

for protection.

He has friends in jail.

-No.

your customer was a tourist?

Something like that.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.945
He was an English dude.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.416

less like a robbery

19:12.418 --> 19:14.152

19:23.329 --> 19:25.563
from the security camera
at the parking lot

the revolver.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.200

Is it usable?

19:29.202 --> 19:30.701
Buzz: The less clarity we have
from the source,

19:30.703 --> 19:33.337
the longer the screen grab takes
to resolve, but probably.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.540
If our killer flew in
from the U.K.,

19:35.542 --> 19:36.941
we should be able to I.D. him

19:36.943 --> 19:38.910
through facial recognition
software

19:38.912 --> 19:40.244
off airport security video.

19:40.246 --> 19:44.015

San Diego,

19:44.017 --> 19:46.984

to gamble, Las Vegas.

looking at passengers

19:51.624 --> 19:52.990

from overseas.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.361
Our killer's
coming into focus.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.363
Which means we'll know
more about him

19:59.365 --> 20:01.132
than we do about
Robert Branson

20:01.134 --> 20:02.967
or why someone
put a hit on him.

as the Panorama Room

make time for other people.

that this mugger's
latest victims

21:32.292 --> 21:34.558
were a couple traveling
through Los Angeles

on their second honeymoon

21:35.795 --> 21:37.628
and that the husband
was shot to death

21:37.630 --> 21:39.130
after beating cancer?

21:39.132 --> 21:42.033
First, Peter, we're not sure
this was a random attack.

21:42.035 --> 21:45.102
There's a very good chance
the Bransons were targeted.

21:45.104 --> 21:47.204
Rubbish.
I've been researching them,

21:47.206 --> 21:49.540
and they're both extremely
well-liked and respected.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.510
No enemies,
no criminal records.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.278
In fact, even though Branson's
business partner

21:54.280 --> 21:56.080
was unhappy about the state
of their partnership,

21:56.082 --> 21:58.482
he still can't say that Robert
did anything even wrong.

21:58.484 --> 22:01.819
And he was legitimately
horrified by Robert's murder.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.921
Well, if you're really
so far along,

22:03.923 --> 22:06.223
maybe there's nothing
we can brief you on.

22:06.225 --> 22:09.026
Unless you knew that
Branson's business partner --

What is his name?

than he actually did.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.672
And I am wondering
if Mr. Finch

22:21.674 --> 22:24.909
fully explained his issue
with the victim to you.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.510
Of course he did.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.412
Branson was ready to unload
his half of the firm.

22:28.414 --> 22:30.715
That's all. I haven't read
their contract yet,

22:30.717 --> 22:33.684
but it seems they were abiding
by a kind of business prenup,

22:33.686 --> 22:35.686
which allowed both of
them to stay at a price

22:35.688 --> 22:37.421
at which they would either sell
or purchase

22:37.423 --> 22:39.023

Peter: And I think you are

three weeks ago.

Okay, I love you.
Have a good dinner.

37:08.026 --> 37:10.727
Marcus: What on Earth
did you say to that woman

37:10.729 --> 37:12.329
to make her give me up
like that?

37:12.331 --> 37:16.199
Claire Branson's a bitch and
a terrible bloody barrister.

37:16.201 --> 37:19.769
Talked to my jury like they were
a bunch of 5-year-olds!

37:19.771 --> 37:22.472
They convicted<i> her,</i>
not<i> me.</i>

37:22.474 --> 37:25.575
Listen, Mr. Kemp, I'm
not going to offer you
a deal of any kind.

37:25.577 --> 37:28.478
Then I want a lawyer, and not
Claire bloody Branson, either.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.748
You don't want a lawyer, because
then you'll have no choices.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.117
Choices?
What choices have I got?

37:34.119 --> 37:36.519
You can go to court here
in the United States

37:36.521 --> 37:38.355
on a charge of
first-degree murder

37:38.357 --> 37:41.024
with special circumstances,
which is a death-penalty case.

37:41.026 --> 37:43.593
Shit.
Tao: And you can await
your execution

37:43.595 --> 37:47.030
at the very posh correctional
facility at San Quentin.

37:47.032 --> 37:49.599
Sharon: Or, Mr. Kemp,
you can tell us the truth.

37:49.601 --> 37:53.503
You can agree to testify against
Claire Branson in court,

37:53.505 --> 37:56.873
and we will return you
to the U.K. for trial.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.942
You can serve out
your sentence in England

37:58.944 --> 38:00.377
with a much better chance
at parole.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.445
Tao: But first you have to
revoke your rights,

38:02.447 --> 38:05.315
write out your confession,
or we arrest you

38:05.317 --> 38:07.917
and let the DNA evidence
do the rest.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.286
Oi.

38:09.288 --> 38:11.221
This is what
it's come to, eh?

38:11.223 --> 38:13.857
Deciding which prison
I die in?

38:13.859 --> 38:16.293
Okay. Fine.

38:16.295 --> 38:19.729
The bitch paid me
to kill her husband,

38:19.731 --> 38:21.197
and that's that.

38:21.199 --> 38:23.667
Why would Claire Branson
kill her husband?

38:23.669 --> 38:25.168
What was her motive?

38:25.170 --> 38:27.470
Claire did everything for Robert
when he was sick --

38:27.472 --> 38:30.473
nursed him,
kept his business together.

38:30.475 --> 38:33.243
Even changed his bedding,
if you know what I mean.

38:33.245 --> 38:36.379
And then when he gets well,
he dumps her.

38:36.381 --> 38:39.349
-Why?
-I don't know, really.

38:39.351 --> 38:41.117
I guess he was dying
for so long

38:41.119 --> 38:43.086
that he wanted to
live it up a little,

38:43.088 --> 38:45.855
stop sleeping with the same bird
every night.

38:45.857 --> 38:47.424
Well, if he's leaving
his wife,

38:47.426 --> 38:49.359
why would he take her
on a second honeymoon?

38:49.361 --> 38:51.528
[ Scoffs ] That was Claire
giving the bastard

38:51.530 --> 38:53.463
one last chance
to do the right thing.

38:53.465 --> 38:56.132
She told Robert
that he owed it to her

38:56.134 --> 38:58.868
to, uh, rekindle the flames
or whatever.

38:58.870 --> 39:00.370
And if he still felt the same

39:00.372 --> 39:02.372
after they relived
their honeymoon

39:02.374 --> 39:03.973
along the California coast,

39:03.975 --> 39:06.076
she'd let him go
with no trouble at all.

39:06.078 --> 39:07.310
And she did.

39:07.312 --> 39:09.546
So you were always
gonna kill him.

39:09.548 --> 39:11.047
No. No.

39:11.049 --> 39:12.716
She could have called me
at any time and said,

39:12.718 --> 39:14.951
"Forget about it, Kemp.
We're back together."

39:14.953 --> 39:17.053
But I never heard from her.

39:17.055 --> 39:18.621
So when they got to Venice,

39:18.623 --> 39:21.191
which Claire had read was
suffering a little crime spree,

39:21.193 --> 39:22.926
I went ahead with it.

39:22.928 --> 39:25.362
My fee was in her purse.

39:25.364 --> 39:28.832
Clever girl, Claire.
Crafty.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.200
Tao: Why come all
the way over here?

39:30.202 --> 39:31.601
You could have killed
Mr. Branson

39:31.603 --> 39:32.502
in Manchester or Chester.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.170
I couldn't get a gun,
could I?

39:34.172 --> 39:37.140
And besides, Robert had already
started cheating on her,

39:37.142 --> 39:39.109
and the coppers
in Manchester

39:39.111 --> 39:41.211
would have tumbled
on that sooner or later.

39:41.213 --> 39:43.646
I don't care how mad
you are at someone.

39:43.648 --> 39:46.049
Divorce is always better.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.551
As for me and mine,
for example,

39:48.553 --> 39:51.254
we just found
ourselves unsuited

39:51.256 --> 39:53.323
and decided to go
our separate ways.

39:53.325 --> 39:55.959
After you beat her
with a clothes hanger

39:55.961 --> 39:58.695
and locked her in the closet
for two days.

39:58.697 --> 40:00.497
We call it a wardrobe.

40:00.499 --> 40:02.265
But yeah, we had
our differences.

40:02.267 --> 40:03.666
Frankly,
I still don't think

40:03.668 --> 40:05.602
she should have slept
with my brother.

40:05.604 --> 40:08.605
Look, lots of things
can unhinge a relationship.

40:08.607 --> 40:11.207
Too much sickness,
too much health,

40:11.209 --> 40:15.445
envy, spite, failure,
even success.

40:15.447 --> 40:17.180
[ Echoing ]
A little bit of success

40:17.182 --> 40:18.882
can bring out the worst
in other people.

40:18.884 --> 40:21.518
Peter: "Just a small bit of good
fortune really can alter

40:21.520 --> 40:24.187
even the best of relationships
in ways they can't survive."

40:24.189 --> 40:26.589
Bit of a philosopher,
your hitman.

40:26.591 --> 40:30.293
Well, I have to admit, Captain,
this is truly a great exclusive.

40:30.295 --> 40:31.828
Well, you earned it,
Peter.

40:31.830 --> 40:35.799
Oh, and thank you all very much
for being so...open.

40:35.801 --> 40:38.334
Oh, and, Buzz, isn't it?
-Yes.

40:38.336 --> 40:39.502
Fantastic you call
yourself that.

40:39.504 --> 40:41.304
Best of luck
on your cold case.

40:41.306 --> 40:44.073
Well, thank you...
I think.

40:44.075 --> 40:45.775
Till the next time,
everyone.

40:45.777 --> 40:48.978
Oh, I can just see
Ogden's headline now.

40:48.980 --> 40:54.150
"Intrepid London Reporter Solves
Major Crime for L.A.P.D."

40:54.152 --> 40:56.519
[ Chuckles ]
He did do his part, Lieutenant.

40:56.521 --> 40:59.389
Oh, here we go. Go.
-H-Hold on a second, Mike.

40:59.391 --> 41:01.024
Where do you think
you're going

41:01.026 --> 41:02.592
with that Platinum TV
Choice Award?

41:02.594 --> 41:04.260
Andy, I think it's about time
I bring it home.

41:04.262 --> 41:05.962
No, no, I think
it's about time

41:05.964 --> 41:09.699
that we all share and celebrate
in your success.

41:09.701 --> 41:11.501
No, I think the time
has really passed.
No, no.

41:11.503 --> 41:14.070
Oh, you can't believe
we're just gonna ignore

41:14.072 --> 41:16.206
something this important?

41:16.208 --> 41:18.975
-Such a big deal.
-[ Chuckles ] Thank you.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.310
We all share a lot of dark

41:20.312 --> 41:22.011
and horrible things
here at work, Mike.

41:22.013 --> 41:24.747
And this is
a<i> really</i> good thing.

41:24.749 --> 41:27.784
And you deserve to be proud
of it, Lieutenant.

41:27.786 --> 41:29.419
Everybody grab a glass.

41:29.421 --> 41:32.388
Oh, my God. This smells like
[sniffs] apple cider.

41:32.390 --> 41:34.157
[ Chuckling ] Because it is.

41:34.159 --> 41:35.225
We<i> are</i> at work, sir.

41:35.227 --> 41:36.659
[ Laughter ]

41:36.661 --> 41:37.994
To Lieutenant Mike.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.629
-To Mike.
-Lieutenant Mike.

41:39.631 --> 41:43.299
-And to "Badge of Justice."
-Hear, hear!

41:43.301 --> 41:45.401
So, how many seasons is this
now, "Badge of Justice"?

41:45.403 --> 41:47.270
I know. Really. It seems like
it was just yesterday.

41:47.272 --> 41:50.507
SYKES:
I know. So, maybe we could all
get like a background or --

41:50.509 --> 41:52.575
what do they call it?
Like, where you walk through.

41:52.577 --> 41:54.277
-Yeah.
-What is it called?

41:54.279 --> 41:57.347
Anybody want a piece of this
really delicious cake?
