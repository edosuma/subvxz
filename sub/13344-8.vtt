WEBVTT

00:05.539 --> 00:08.309
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.409 --> 00:10.544
I REALLY DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED.

00:10.644 --> 00:13.347
I WAS ON MY BICYCLE
AND A CAR RAN INTO ME AND--

00:13.447 --> 00:15.249
WHAT DID THEY
TELL YOU AFTERWARDS?

00:15.349 --> 00:17.518
THAT I FLEW MY BIKE
RIGHT INTO THE STREET.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.720
THEY TOLD ME THAT
I NEEDED THE OPINION
OF A PSYCHIATRIST

00:19.820 --> 00:22.290
BECAUSE THE INSURANCE
COMPANY OF THE CAR
THAT HIT ME

00:22.390 --> 00:23.991
HAS A PROBLEM
WITH MY INJURIES.

00:24.092 --> 00:25.426
HOW DO YOU GET
ON WITH YOUR DAD?

00:25.526 --> 00:27.361
HE'S THE ONLY
PERSON IN THIS WORLD

00:27.461 --> 00:30.831
WHO TRULY LOVES ME,
THE ONLY ONE EXCEPT CY.

00:30.931 --> 00:31.999
WHO'S CY?

00:32.100 --> 00:33.934
THIS IS CY.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.670
HE'S MY COACH.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.542
( rain pattering )

00:41.642 --> 00:44.445
( thunder rumbling )

00:45.113 --> 00:47.781
( phone ringing )

00:50.518 --> 00:52.186
HELLO?

00:52.286 --> 00:54.388
- Man: Sophie.
- Sophie: Stop the car.

00:54.488 --> 00:57.125
- Man: Calm down.
- I wanna get out!

00:57.225 --> 00:59.460
- Did you hear what I said?
- Just calm down.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.462
- Sophie: I wanna walk.
- It's pouring.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.397
Sophie:
I don't care if it's raining.
I wanna walk!

01:03.497 --> 01:05.199
- Man: No, it's
too far to walk.
- Fine!

01:05.299 --> 01:07.368
- ( door opens )
- Man: Sophie!

01:07.468 --> 01:09.503
- Sophie.
- ( door closes )

01:09.603 --> 01:12.140
( busy signal )

01:20.181 --> 01:23.284
( sighs )

01:25.919 --> 01:28.822
( theme music playing )

01:46.874 --> 01:48.776
- Paul: ARE YOU--
- I'M FINE.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.712
I'M FINE.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.852
CY SAYS YOU HAVE
TO EXPERIENCE THE RAIN.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.788
SO I'VE EXPERIENCED IT.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.723
I'LL GET YOU
SOME DRY CLOTHES.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.725
I'M FINE.

02:04.825 --> 02:08.162
REALLY?
ARE YOU SURE YOU WOULDN'T
BE MORE COMFORTABLE IF--

02:08.262 --> 02:10.564
WAIT A SECOND.

02:12.500 --> 02:17.271
- ( door opens )
- ( steps fading )

02:35.956 --> 02:37.491
HERE WE GO.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.427
- ARE THEY
YOUR DAUGHTER'S?
- MM-HMM.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.229
DID YOU ASK HER
IF IT WAS OKAY?

02:41.329 --> 02:43.264
NO, BUT I'M SURE
SHE WON'T MIND.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.433
I'LL PUT YOURS
IN THE DRYER

02:45.533 --> 02:47.568
AND THEY'LL BE
READY BY THE END
OF THE SESSION.

02:50.070 --> 02:52.606
WELL, YOU'LL HAVE
TO HELP ME.

02:52.706 --> 02:55.709
I HAVEN'T GOT
DRESSED ON MY OWN
SINCE MY ACCIDENT.

02:59.447 --> 03:02.182
ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME
HERE OR NOT?

03:05.052 --> 03:09.723
DID YOU EVER HEAR
OF AN UMBRELLA, KIDDO?
MY GOODNESS.

03:12.159 --> 03:16.364
SWEETHEART, LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE JUST ALL SKIN AND
BONES, AREN'T YOU?

03:17.465 --> 03:19.066
OKAY, I WILL HAVE THESE
DRY FOR YOU

03:19.166 --> 03:21.469
BEFORE YOU LEAVE.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.906
HOW ON EARTH DO YOU
MANAGE WITH TWO
BROKEN ARMS?

03:26.006 --> 03:27.575
I DON'T.

03:27.675 --> 03:31.211
WHAT, ONE ARM WASN'T
ENOUGH FOR YOU, HUH?

03:33.146 --> 03:35.449
OKAY.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.252
YOU KNOW, I BROKE
MY ARM WHEN I WAS 12
AND I WAS ROLLER-SKATING.

03:38.352 --> 03:41.622
AND THE BEST THING ABOUT IT
WAS THAT I GOT TO WHACK
MY LITTLE BROTHER

03:41.722 --> 03:44.425
IN THE HEAD WITH MY CAST
WHEN HE WAS BUGGING ME,

03:44.525 --> 03:46.627
WHICH WAS PRETTY MUCH
ALL THE TIME.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.464
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S DO YOUR SHOES.

04:02.142 --> 04:03.711
SHE'S COOL.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.746
- KATE?
- YEAH.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.883
SHE'S AWESOME.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.753
TRUE.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.424
YOU COULD LEARN
A LOT FROM YOUR WIFE

04:16.524 --> 04:18.759
ABOUT HOW
TO TALK TO PEOPLE.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.600
WISH I COULD TAKE HER
WITH ME TO THE GYM.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.702
SHE COULD TELL EVERYONE
THE TRUTH TO THEIR FACES.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.839
WHO DO YOU WANT HER
TO TELL THE TRUTH TO?

04:33.674 --> 04:35.309
DID YOU WRITE
MY EVALUATION?

04:35.409 --> 04:37.978
NO.
DID YOU?

04:38.078 --> 04:40.948
WHAT THE FUCK?!
WHY DIDN'T YOU?

04:41.048 --> 04:43.984
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
THAT'S ALL I NEED FROM YOU,

04:44.084 --> 04:45.686
THAT STUPID EVALUATION.

04:45.786 --> 04:50.123
ACTUALLY,
I DON'T THINK I KNOW YOU
QUITE WELL ENOUGH

04:50.223 --> 04:52.092
YET, SOPHIE.

04:52.192 --> 04:56.764
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
WRITE YOURS?

05:02.302 --> 05:04.905
WELL, I TRIED

05:05.005 --> 05:06.340
WITH MY DAD,

05:06.440 --> 05:08.509
BUT HE'S TOO BUSY
WITH HIS EXHIBITION.

05:08.609 --> 05:11.178
- OH, HE'S AN ARTIST?
- A PHOTOGRAPHER.

05:11.278 --> 05:13.781
HE HATES
THE WORD "ARTIST."

05:13.881 --> 05:16.083
HE ALWAYS HAS
HIS EXHIBITIONS AT HOME

05:16.183 --> 05:18.619
BECAUSE HE'S
AGAINST GALLERIES.

05:23.757 --> 05:26.360
ANYWAY, HE SAID IT WAS
TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL

05:26.460 --> 05:28.295
FOR ME TO WRITE
MY OWN EVALUATION

05:28.396 --> 05:31.098
AND THAT YOU SOUND
LIKE A QUACK.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.367
ARE YOU A QUACK?

05:33.467 --> 05:36.970
NO, I AM NOT
A QUACK.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.039
I PROMISE.

05:44.311 --> 05:46.279
AND THEN I TRIED
TO WRITE IT WITH MY MOM.

05:46.380 --> 05:49.316
THAT DIDN'T WORK--
OBVIOUSLY.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.851
WHY DO YOU SAY
OBVIOUSLY?

05:50.951 --> 05:54.522
BECAUSE SHE'S A TOTAL
TOOL AND A RETARD.

05:54.622 --> 05:58.291
A TOOL AND A RETARD?

05:58.392 --> 06:00.728
YEAH.
WE GOT IN A FIGHT.

06:00.828 --> 06:03.764
AND I WAS LIKE,
"I SO DO NOT NEED THIS
RIGHT NOW."

06:03.864 --> 06:06.400
SO I LEFT.

06:08.836 --> 06:11.204
I WENT TO THIS
APARTMENT NEAR THE GYM

06:11.304 --> 06:12.840
WHERE THE FOREIGN
GIRLS STAY.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.075
I TOLD THEM MY PARENTS
WERE GOING OUT OF TOWN

06:15.175 --> 06:17.678
SO THEY LET ME
CRASH THERE.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.887
AND THEN I TRIED TO GET
CY TO HELP ME WRITE IT,

06:26.987 --> 06:30.023
BUT HE'S TOO BUSY GETTING
EVERYONE READY TO LEAVE
FOR TRAINING CAMP.

06:30.123 --> 06:34.595
SO I DIDN'T DO IT.

06:34.695 --> 06:37.431
SO WHY DID YOU
AND YOUR MOM GET
INTO A FIGHT

06:37.531 --> 06:40.568
TRYING TO WRITE
THE EVALUATION
TOGETHER?

06:40.668 --> 06:42.970
WELL, SHE ACTUALLY WANTED
TO WRITE IT FOR ME.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.806
- OH.
- AND I WAS LIKE, "NO, MOM,
I CAN DO IT MYSELF."

06:45.906 --> 06:48.776
AND SHE WAS LIKE,
"WE'LL BE HERE UNTIL
THE NEXT OLYMPICS."

06:48.876 --> 06:50.944
AND I WAS LIKE,
"BITE ME."

06:51.044 --> 06:53.647
- SO I LEFT.
- SO YOU DIDN'T WANT HER
TO WRITE IT.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.450
YOU JUST WANTED HER
TO HELP YOU,

06:56.550 --> 06:58.452
- WHAT, PHRASE IT?
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.253
WE GOT IN A FIGHT,
FOR A CHANGE.

07:00.353 --> 07:03.223
BUT THIS TIME,
SOPHIE,

07:03.323 --> 07:05.659
YOU LEFT HOME.

07:06.326 --> 07:07.795
SO?

07:07.895 --> 07:11.198
- HAVE YOU DONE
THAT BEFORE?
- NO.

07:11.298 --> 07:15.068
SO SOMETHING
WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT
THIS PARTICULAR FIGHT.

07:15.168 --> 07:18.506
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WAS
THAT WAS DIFFERENT?

07:24.845 --> 07:26.914
DID YOU--
DID YOU COME FROM HOME

07:27.014 --> 07:29.917
OR DID YOU COME
FROM THE GYM TODAY?

07:30.017 --> 07:32.953
- THE GYM.
- GYM-- IS THAT FAR AWAY?

07:33.053 --> 07:35.823
THAT'S WHY I WAS LATE.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.191
SOPHIE,

07:38.291 --> 07:40.894
BEFORE YOU ARRIVED,
I, UH--

07:40.994 --> 07:42.630
I GOT A PHONE CALL

07:42.730 --> 07:45.866
AND, UM, I HEARD YOU
ASKING SOMEBODY

07:45.966 --> 07:48.702
TO LET YOU OUT
OF THE CAR.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.806
UM, WELL, I--

07:52.906 --> 07:56.009
I TRIED TO CALL YOU
TO TELL YOU I WAS
ON MY WAY,

07:56.109 --> 07:57.645
BUT, UM,
THEN I FIGURED

07:57.745 --> 08:00.748
THAT WE WERE LIKE
FIVE MINUTES AWAY, SO...

08:00.848 --> 08:03.183
I THOUGHT I HUNG UP BEFORE
THE CALL WENT THROUGH.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.418
WAS THAT YOUR FATHER?

08:05.519 --> 08:07.387
YOU COULD'VE HUNG UP,
YOU KNOW?

08:07.487 --> 08:10.691
OR DO YOU ALWAYS
EAVESDROP ON OTHER PEOPLE'S
CONVERSATIONS?

08:10.791 --> 08:12.726
SOPHIE, IF YOU WERE MY PATIENT,
I'D ASK IF YOU THOUGHT

08:12.826 --> 08:15.095
IT WAS A COINCIDENCE
THAT I OVERHEARD THAT
CONVERSATION.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.665
BUT I'M NOT YOUR PATIENT.
I WOULDN'T SEE A THERAPIST

08:17.765 --> 08:21.569
WHO I THOUGHT
WAS AN EAVESDROPPER.
I'D BE OUT OF HERE.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.005
SO DID YOUR DAD
BRING YOU IN?

08:25.105 --> 08:26.707
I TOLD YOU,
I HAD A FIGHT WITH HIM!

08:26.807 --> 08:30.010
I THOUGHT YOU
SAID THE FIGHT
WAS WITH YOUR MOM.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.647
IT'S REALLY
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS
WHO I CAME HERE WITH.

08:40.788 --> 08:43.523
EARLIER ON YOU SAID
THAT YOU'D LIKE

08:43.624 --> 08:46.293
KATE TO GO
TO THE GYM WITH YOU.

08:46.393 --> 08:49.863
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE KATE
TO TELL THE GIRLS AT THE GYM?

08:55.502 --> 08:57.571
YOUR DAUGHTER'S
CLOTHES ARE GROSS.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.807
- ( chuckles )
- WHY IS THAT FUNNY?

08:59.907 --> 09:03.010
WELL, WHY ARE
THEY GROSS?

09:03.110 --> 09:05.145
THEY'RE HIDEOUS.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.881
OKAY.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.822
I'M REALLY NOT
GETTING MY EVALUATION
TODAY, AM I?

09:17.290 --> 09:19.259
THIS IS STUPID.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.763
I SHOULD GO.
ARE MY CLOTHES DRY YET?

09:22.863 --> 09:23.997
I WOULDN'T THINK SO.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.999
CAN YOU CHECK?

09:28.201 --> 09:31.338
AND CALL KATE, BECAUSE
I NEED HER TO HELP ME
PUT THEM BACK ON.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.609
YOU PEOPLE ARE SUCH TOOLS.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.945
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GET
PAID FOR THIS.

09:42.983 --> 09:45.619
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
BEFORE THAT YOU HEARD
MY CONVERSATION?

09:45.719 --> 09:48.088
I WAS WAITING FOR YOU
TO TELL ME.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.623
SO NOW I'M A LIAR TOO?

09:49.723 --> 09:52.225
I DIDN'T SAY YOU WERE
A LIAR, SOPHIE.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.027
IT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

10:03.771 --> 10:06.206
WHY DO YOU NEED KATE
TO GO TO THE GYM WITH YOU?

10:06.306 --> 10:08.642
I DON'T NEED HER TO.

10:08.742 --> 10:11.044
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

10:11.144 --> 10:14.547
HOW DO YOU GET ALONG
WITH THE GIRLS
AT THE GYM?

10:14.648 --> 10:16.817
THEY'RE ASSHOLES, OKAY?

10:16.917 --> 10:21.154
ALL OF THEM.
THE WHOLE PLACE,
IT REEKS OF HYPOCRISY.

10:21.254 --> 10:24.725
DID YOU KNOW, LIKE,
EVERY GIRL THERE IS A MIA
OR AN ANNA EXCEPT ME?

10:24.825 --> 10:29.162
THEY KNOW IT.
THEY JUST DON'T DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.899
- THEY ENCOURAGE IT.
- THESE GIRLS, ANNA AND MIA,

10:31.999 --> 10:34.167
ARE THEY FRIENDS
OF YOURS?

10:35.102 --> 10:36.804
YOU DON'T KNOW
THESE GIRLS?

10:36.904 --> 10:40.874
THEY'RE FUN GIRLS,
ESPECIALLY ANNA.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.375
REXIC?

10:43.576 --> 10:45.178
ANOREXIC.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.615
OKAY.
AND MIA, BULIMIA?

10:48.716 --> 10:50.984
YOU'RE SHARP AS A TACK.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.186
THANK YOU.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.555
SO THE GIRLS AT THE GYM

10:55.655 --> 10:57.825
ARE ANOREXIC OR BULIMIC
EXCEPT FOR YOU?

10:57.925 --> 11:00.694
YOU CAN'T KEEP
YOUR WEIGHT DOWN
OTHERWISE.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.430
AND IF YOU'RE NOT
SKINNY YOU CAN'T COMPETE

11:03.530 --> 11:04.698
SO YOU HAVE NO CHOICE,
YOU HAVE TO.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.433
BUT WHO SAYS
YOU CAN'T COMPETE?

11:06.533 --> 11:09.369
CY AND REGINA.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.571
REGINA IS
OUR PHYSICAL TRAINER.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.907
OH.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.177
ALL THE GIRLS
FOLLOW CY AROUND LIKE
LITTLE GROUPIE SLUTS.

11:17.277 --> 11:22.015
"CY, WAS THAT OKAY?"
"CY, CAN YOU SHOW ME
HOW TO DO THAT MOVE?"

11:22.115 --> 11:26.286
"CY, I'M ABOUT TO FALL.
QUICK, PUT YOUR HANDS
BETWEEN MY LEGS."

11:26.386 --> 11:29.056
( snickers )
BUT NOT REGINA

11:29.156 --> 11:33.326
'CAUSE SHE'S RUSSIAN.
SO HER BULLSHIT DETECTOR
IS LIKE NUCLEAR.

11:33.426 --> 11:35.128
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY

11:35.228 --> 11:37.130
CY AND REGINA DECIDE
EVERYTHING--

11:37.230 --> 11:41.034
WHO COMPETES,
WHO'S GAINED WEIGHT
AND CAN'T COMPETE.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.836
HMM.

11:44.404 --> 11:45.906
AFTER MY ACCIDENT,

11:46.006 --> 11:49.609
KAREN SCOTT
AND AUDREY ENGLAND
CAME TO VISIT ME.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.746
THEY HAD THESE PATHETIC
LOOKS ON THEIR FACES

11:52.846 --> 11:56.183
LIKE THEY FELT MY PAIN.
BUT I KNEW THEY
WERE HAPPY.

11:56.283 --> 11:59.019
I WOULD HAVE BEEN
HAPPY IF SOMETHING HAD
HAPPENED TO ONE OF THEM

11:59.119 --> 12:02.055
RIGHT BEFORE
THE OLYMPIC TRYOUTS.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.724
HONESTLY,

12:04.825 --> 12:06.726
IF IT WAS ME,

12:06.827 --> 12:08.495
I WOULD HAVE DONE
WHAT SHIRLEY DID.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.330
SHE DIDN'T EVEN COME.

12:10.430 --> 12:14.134
ME AND HER,
WE'RE LIKE THE BEST ONES
THERE BY FAR.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.470
IT WAS LIKE
SHE WAS SAYING,
"DROP DEAD FOR ALL I CARE.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.273
JUST GET OUT
OF MY FACE."

12:20.373 --> 12:22.075
AT LEAST THAT'S HONEST.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.344
HMM.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.719
SO THEY'RE
LEAVING TOMORROW

12:32.820 --> 12:34.654
FOR TRAINING CAMP
IN CALIFORNIA

12:34.754 --> 12:36.556
AND I HAVE
NOWHERE TO GO.

12:36.656 --> 12:39.893
THEY WON'T LET ME STAY
AT THE APARTMENT
BY MYSELF.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.694
THEY PROMISED CY
I COULD GO,

12:41.795 --> 12:43.363
EVEN THOUGH
I CAN'T TRAIN.

12:43.463 --> 12:46.133
AND NOW HE SAYS THEY'VE
CHANGED THEIR MINDS.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.468
- WHO'S THEY?
- THE SPONSORS--

12:48.568 --> 12:50.737
THE MONEY PEOPLE.

12:50.838 --> 12:53.106
ANYWAY,

12:53.206 --> 12:56.309
I PICKED A FIGHT
WITH HIM.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.445
THAT'S WHAT YOU HEARD
ON THE PHONE.

12:58.545 --> 13:01.014
IT WASN'T HIS FAULT.

13:08.021 --> 13:11.124
WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT
FOR YOU TO GO WITH THEM?

13:11.224 --> 13:12.725
TO THE CAMP?

13:12.826 --> 13:13.861
MM-HMM.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.529
EVERYONE WILL BE THERE.

13:16.629 --> 13:21.401
YOU MEAN, KAREN,
AUDREY AND SHIRLEY?

13:21.501 --> 13:23.536
BUT-- BUT YOU SAID
YOU CAN'T STAND THEM.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.172
YOU SAID YOU DON'T
EVEN LIKE THEM.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.107
AND YOU CAN'T
TRAIN ANYWAY,

13:27.207 --> 13:29.342
SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO YOU.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.811
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.548
BUT I WAS LOOKING
FORWARD TO IT.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.354
SOUNDS LIKE, UM...

13:41.454 --> 13:43.356
YOU AND CY ARE, UH--

13:45.525 --> 13:46.860
- YOU'RE VERY CLOSE.
- NO.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.828
WHY? CAN YOU TELL
THAT OVER THE PHONE?

13:48.929 --> 13:52.332
YOU SAID HE WANTED
TO TAKE YOU TO CAMP

13:52.432 --> 13:54.401
DESPITE THE FACT THAT
YOU HAD AN INJURY.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.904
AND DIDN'T HE--
DIDN'T HE DRIVE YOU HERE?

13:57.004 --> 13:59.106
IT WAS ON HIS WAY.

13:59.206 --> 14:02.409
HE WANTS ME TO COME
TO THE CAMP TO AT LEAST
WATCH THE TRAINING

14:02.509 --> 14:03.843
SO I DON'T LOSE
FOCUS.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.612
BUT NO.

14:05.712 --> 14:08.481
HE COULDN'T
MAKE THEM PAY
FOR DARLENE EITHER.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.284
- DARLENE?
- CY'S WIFE.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.420
SHE HAS TO PAY HER OWN WAY
AND DANA'S TOO.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.356
DANA IS THE LITTLE GIRL
YOU USED TO BABYSIT?

14:19.492 --> 14:21.061
WHY DID YOU STOP?

14:21.161 --> 14:23.296
WHO TOLD YOU I STOPPED?

14:23.396 --> 14:25.398
DID I TELL YOU THAT
LAST WEEK?

14:27.334 --> 14:28.835
YOU HAVE A GOOD MEMORY
FOR AN OLD FART.

14:28.936 --> 14:31.838
( laughs )

14:31.939 --> 14:34.041
THANK YOU.

14:34.141 --> 14:36.009
SO WHY DID YOU STOP?

14:36.109 --> 14:39.246
THEY DIDN'T
NEED ME ANYMORE.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.581
DANA USED TO HAVE
ALL THESE BREATHING
PROBLEMS,

14:41.681 --> 14:44.918
BUT THEN SHE
HAD THIS SURGERY
AND THEY GOT BETTER.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.620
AND DARLENE CAME BACK
FROM WISCONSIN

14:47.720 --> 14:51.024
WHERE SHE WAS
LEARNING TO PROCESS HER
OWN CHEESE OR SOMETHING.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.626
SO THEY DIDN'T NEED ME.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.430
DID YOU WORK THERE
FOR A LONG TIME?

14:57.530 --> 15:01.201
NO.
SORT OF.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.236
AND DANA MUST HAVE
BECOME VERY FOND OF YOU.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.138
DID SHE BECOME
ATTACHED TO YOU?

15:05.238 --> 15:06.773
YEAH.

15:06.873 --> 15:09.309
SHE'S THE CUTEST.

15:09.409 --> 15:13.213
SHE HASN'T STOPPED TALKING
ABOUT ME SINCE I LEFT.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.282
SHE SAID SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO GO TO CALIFORNIA

15:15.382 --> 15:17.350
IF I'M NOT
GOING TO BE THERE.

15:20.720 --> 15:24.091
THEY TOLD HER
THAT I WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO BABYSIT HER ANYMORE

15:24.191 --> 15:26.326
'CAUSE I'D HAD
THIS ACCIDENT.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.929
BUT SEE, I'D ALREADY
TOLD HER BEFORE

15:30.030 --> 15:33.166
THAT I COULDN'T KEEP
LIVING WITH THEM ONCE
HER MOM CAME HOME.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.602
- I WANTED TO PREPARE
HER, YOU KNOW?
- MM-HMM.

15:35.702 --> 15:38.371
BUT THEY DIDN'T
TELL ME WHAT THEY
WERE TELLING HER

15:38.471 --> 15:42.042
SO THE WHOLE LIE
BECAME MIXED UP
IN HER HEAD.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.346
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

15:46.446 --> 15:48.015
YOU LOOK SCARED
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

15:48.115 --> 15:51.284
( chuckles )
I LOOK SCARED?

15:51.384 --> 15:53.186
LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING
AT A PSYCHO OR SOMETHING.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.188
I WAS JUST REMEMBERING
THAT THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE HERE

15:55.288 --> 15:59.626
YOU PUT YOUR--
YOUR CASTS TOGETHER.
DO YOU YOU REMEMBER?

15:59.726 --> 16:02.229
AND YOU SAID,
"THIS IS CY."

16:02.329 --> 16:06.066
YEAH, THE MERMAID
THAT HE DREW.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.102
YOU SAID THAT
WHEN DARLENE CAME HOME

16:09.202 --> 16:11.504
YOU KNEW YOU COULDN'T
KEEP ON LIVING THERE.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.742
I NEVER SAID
I LIVED THERE.

16:15.842 --> 16:18.278
BUT YOU TOLD DANA
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO GO ON LIVING THERE.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.382
YEAH, BECAUSE
SHE'S A CHILD

16:22.482 --> 16:24.917
SO IT FELT TO HER
LIKE I LIVED THERE.

16:25.018 --> 16:28.321
'CAUSE SHE'D GO
TO SCHOOL

16:28.421 --> 16:30.323
AND COME BACK
AND I'D BE THERE.

16:30.423 --> 16:33.260
AND, YOU KNOW, SHE GOT
USED TO ME BEING AROUND.

16:33.360 --> 16:38.098
SO EVEN WHEN HE WAS HOME
SHE'D WANT ME TO STAY--

16:38.198 --> 16:41.301
COOK THEM DINNER,
DO HER HOMEWORK WITH HER.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.470
SOMETIMES SHE'D
WAKE UP SCREAMING

16:43.570 --> 16:45.738
BECAUSE SHE STOPPED
BREATHING IN HER SLEEP.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.243
CY TOLD ME THAT.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.748
WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON HERE?

16:55.848 --> 16:58.885
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

16:58.985 --> 17:01.188
MY DAD WAS RIGHT.
I'LL GO TO THERAPY

17:01.288 --> 17:02.922
AND I'LL END UP A PSYCHO

17:03.022 --> 17:04.791
JUST LIKE YOUR DAUGHTER.

17:04.891 --> 17:07.327
EVERYONE THINKS
SHE'S A FREAK.

17:07.427 --> 17:09.062
ARE YOU TRYING
TO HURT ME, SOPHIE?

17:09.162 --> 17:11.431
NO, BUT YOU SHOULD
KNOW WHAT PEOPLE SAY
ABOUT HER.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.700
SHE HAD THIS THING
WITH THIS GUY

17:13.800 --> 17:16.936
AND AFTERWARDS
EVERYONE SAYS SHE'D
TURNED OUT PSYCHO

17:17.036 --> 17:19.372
'CAUSE HER DAD
IS A SHRINK.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.641
SHRINKS' KIDS ARE PSYCHO.
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.310
MMM.

17:23.410 --> 17:26.079
WELL, MAYBE
THAT'S BECAUSE--

17:26.179 --> 17:30.417
BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE
ARE AFRAID OF THERAPY.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.819
THEY'RE AFRAID OF WHAT
THEY MIGHT FIND OUT.

17:32.919 --> 17:36.356
THEY'RE AFRAID THAT
IT MIGHT TOUCH
THOSE WOUNDS

17:36.456 --> 17:40.260
THAT ARE DEEP
INSIDE THEM.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.962
I THINK THERE ARE
THINGS THAT...

17:43.062 --> 17:44.497
PERHAPS...

17:44.597 --> 17:46.466
YOU FEEL DEEP INSIDE,
SOPHIE,

17:46.566 --> 17:48.635
THAT YOU'D LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.771
I'M FINE.
YOU WANNA WORRY
ABOUT A LITTLE GIRL?

17:51.871 --> 17:53.440
WORRY ABOUT YOUR OWN KID.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.642
DOES IT BOTHER YOU
THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT
MY DAUGHTER?

17:55.742 --> 17:58.245
WHY WOULD IT BOTHER ME?

17:58.345 --> 17:59.679
BECAUSE MAYBE YOU KNOW
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.948
- MAYBE I DON'T.
- WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR COACH

18:02.048 --> 18:04.384
AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU
BROUGHT UP THE STORY
OF MY DAUGHTER.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.753
YEAH, BECAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

18:06.853 --> 18:11.524
ARE THERE PEOPLE WHO
SAY THINGS ABOUT
YOU, SOPHIE?

18:11.624 --> 18:16.363
AT THE GYM MAYBE?

18:16.463 --> 18:19.266
YOU KNOW, SOPHIE,
SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE
ARE JEALOUS

18:19.366 --> 18:21.868
THEY SAY THINGS
TO HURT US

18:21.968 --> 18:23.703
BECAUSE THEY ENVY US.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.805
DO YOU THINK THAT SOME
OF THE GIRLS AT THE GYM

18:25.905 --> 18:28.508
MIGHT BE JEALOUS
OF YOU

18:28.608 --> 18:33.079
AND HOW CLOSE
YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS
WITH CY?

18:33.180 --> 18:36.583
DON'T TALK TO ME
LIKE I'M A CHILD, PLEASE.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.519
FAIR ENOUGH.

18:42.155 --> 18:43.923
SOPHIE, I GET THE FEELING
THAT YOU'RE AFRAID

18:44.023 --> 18:46.859
TO TELL ME SOMETHING
THAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY
ABOUT YOU.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.162
ARE MY CLOTHES DRY YET?

18:49.262 --> 18:50.597
CAN YOU GO CHECK?

18:50.697 --> 18:52.865
IF I WON'T BE GETTING
AN EVALUATION TODAY

18:52.965 --> 18:54.801
I'D AT LEAST
LIKE DRY CLOTHES.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.536
( whispers)
OKAY.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.371
WELL, I HAVE
STARTED TO WRITE IT.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.308
CAN I SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT?

19:01.408 --> 19:05.312
I'M, UH--
I'M NOT QUITE
FINISHED YET.

19:05.412 --> 19:08.181
I'LL BET YOU HAVEN'T
WRITTEN A WORD.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.803
"SOPHIE'S EVALUATION:

19:32.905 --> 19:35.408
16 YEARS OLD,
A GYMNAST.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.911
SHE IS AN OLYMPIC HOPEFUL.
SHE CAME IN FOR EVALUATION

19:39.011 --> 19:42.081
AFTER A NEAR-FATAL
ACCIDENT.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.150
DURING FIRST SESSION
APPEARS TO BE

19:44.251 --> 19:46.185
VERY IMPRESSIVE,
SENSITIVE,

19:46.286 --> 19:49.656
MATURE FOR HER AGE,

19:49.756 --> 19:51.391
VERY INTELLIGENT

19:51.491 --> 19:54.727
AND A HIGHLY-INDEPENDENT
PERSONALITY."

20:17.350 --> 20:19.719
I TRIED TO WRITE IT...

20:21.254 --> 20:23.390
WITH MY MOM BUT--

20:27.594 --> 20:30.730
WE DIDN'T FIGHT.
I JUST SAID "NEVER MIND."

20:32.332 --> 20:35.368
( sniffs )

20:35.468 --> 20:37.604
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THOSE THINGS YOU WROTE?

20:37.704 --> 20:40.440
ABSOLUTELY.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.509
THEY'RE JUST GENERALITIES
AT THE MOMENT.

20:42.609 --> 20:46.413
IT'S NOT ENOUGH
FOR A REAL EVALUATION.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.023
( chuckles )
YOU KNOW,

20:57.123 --> 21:01.428
THIS MORNING
I TRIED TO BRUSH
MY TEETH LIKE YOU.

21:01.528 --> 21:03.730
- LIKE ME?
- MM-HMM.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.332
LIKE--

21:08.368 --> 21:11.871
- HOW'D IT GO?
- COULDN'T DO IT.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.708
I JUST STICK IT IN THERE.

21:20.179 --> 21:22.148
WHY'D YOU TRY THAT?

21:22.248 --> 21:24.917
'CAUSE I WANTED
TO KNOW HOW IT FEELS.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.152
HOW DID IT FEEL?

21:26.252 --> 21:28.388
I FELT USELESS,

21:28.488 --> 21:31.824
LIKE DEMEANED
OR SOMETHING.

21:38.331 --> 21:41.267
I'M HOMELESS.

21:41.368 --> 21:43.870
I HAVE NOWHERE TO GO.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.505
WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD?

21:45.605 --> 21:47.674
I TOLD YOU,
I HAD A FIGHT WITH HIM.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.877
NOT A REAL FIGHT,
BUT HE PISSED ME OFF.

21:50.977 --> 21:54.447
HE KNOWS HOW MUCH
I WANTED TO GO TO THAT
TRAINING CAMP WITH THEM

21:54.547 --> 21:57.617
AND HE DIDN'T
EVEN OFFER TO PAY.

21:57.717 --> 22:00.787
I WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN
HIS MONEY ANYWAY.

22:00.887 --> 22:04.123
OBVIOUSLY, THE EXHIBITIONS
ARE EXPENSIVE, BUT--

22:04.223 --> 22:07.527
WHY IS IT
SO IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO GO
TO THIS CAMP, SOPHIE?

22:09.396 --> 22:11.831
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT...

22:11.931 --> 22:14.601
ANYMORE.

22:19.706 --> 22:23.042
HOW DO YOU GET
ALONG WITH CY'S WIFE?

22:24.076 --> 22:26.613
FINE.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.848
I DON'T WANNA TALK
ABOUT THEM.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.483
OKAY.

22:30.583 --> 22:33.720
WHEN YOU'RE READY,
WE WILL.

22:35.321 --> 22:37.424
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU WALKED IN HERE

22:37.524 --> 22:40.727
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF

22:40.827 --> 22:44.363
SOMEBODY IN YOUR LIFE
HAS BROKEN THE RULES.

22:45.164 --> 22:46.766
AND I FELT

22:46.866 --> 22:49.135
THAT IF I HAD HELPED
YOU CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES,

22:49.235 --> 22:52.405
THAT I WOULD
HAVE BEEN DOING
THE SAME THING.

22:52.505 --> 22:56.576
I FELT LIKE
YOU WERE TESTING ME.

22:56.676 --> 22:59.211
I FELT LIKE YOU
WANTED TO MAKE SURE

22:59.311 --> 23:00.713
THAT THIS WAS A SAFE PLACE,

23:00.813 --> 23:03.916
THAT THE SAME THINGS
THAT HAPPEN OUT THERE

23:04.016 --> 23:05.818
DON'T HAPPEN IN HERE.

23:21.934 --> 23:24.003
RIGHT WHEN
THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED...

23:26.338 --> 23:28.941
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.444
BUT RIGHT AFTERWARDS

23:31.544 --> 23:34.681
I REMEMBER THE WHOLE
WORLD WAS SILENT.

23:35.748 --> 23:38.585
NOT JUST SILENT,
SOUNDLESS.

23:38.685 --> 23:42.088
YOU KNOW, LIKE THERE HAD
NEVER BEEN ANY NOISE EVER,

23:42.188 --> 23:45.157
NOT EVEN THAT HUM
THAT YOU HEAR WHEN YOU'RE
IN AN EMPTY ROOM.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.426
NOTHING.

23:49.295 --> 23:51.430
EVEN INSIDE THE AMBULANCE,

23:51.531 --> 23:54.200
PEOPLE WERE TALKING
AND IT WAS LIKE--

23:54.300 --> 23:57.036
IT WAS LIKE
I'D GONE DEAF.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.606
I FELT RELIEVED.

23:59.706 --> 24:02.174
I THOUGHT THAT I
WOULD NEVER HAVE TO LISTEN

24:02.274 --> 24:04.076
TO ANYBODY EVER AGAIN.

24:06.345 --> 24:08.114
SOUND CAME BACK THOUGH,

24:08.214 --> 24:11.017
AT FIRST FROM FAR AWAY.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.152
THE EMT, SHE KEPT SAYING,

24:13.252 --> 24:16.856
"I HAVE TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.
I HAVE TO HEAR YOUR VOICE,
SWEETHEART."

24:16.956 --> 24:19.892
SHE WANTED MY PARENTS'
PHONE NUMBERS.

24:19.992 --> 24:24.096
SHE WANTED THEM
TO COME MEET ME WHEN
I GOT TO THE HOSPITAL.

24:24.196 --> 24:27.567
THERE WAS NO WAY.

24:27.667 --> 24:30.336
THEY CAN'T EVEN SIT
IN THE SAME SECTION
AT MY MEETS.

24:30.436 --> 24:33.573
I HAVE TO WAVE
TO TWO DIFFERENT SPOTS
AFTER MY ROUTINE.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.875
I LOOK SCHIZO.

24:38.745 --> 24:40.647
I TRIED TO SIT UP.

24:40.747 --> 24:43.683
I TOLD THE EMT THAT
I WANTED TO SEE THE OUTSIDE.

24:43.783 --> 24:47.419
- WHY?
- YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU
SEE AN AMBULANCE

24:47.520 --> 24:50.590
TEARING DOWN THE STREET,
YOU TURN AND LOOK.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.559
WELL, I WANTED TO SEE
WHAT IT WAS LIKE

24:52.659 --> 24:55.427
BEING ON THE INSIDE
LOOKING OUT.

24:55.528 --> 24:58.330
YOU KNOW, SEEING PEOPLE'S
FACES ON THE SIDEWALK

24:58.430 --> 25:00.499
WONDERING,
"WHO'S IN THERE?

25:00.600 --> 25:02.735
IS SHE GOING TO BE OKAY?"

25:03.670 --> 25:06.072
I COULDN'T SIT UP.
THE EMT,

25:06.172 --> 25:08.274
SHE HAD THIS MIRROR
THAT SHE TRIED TO ANGLE

25:08.374 --> 25:10.677
SO THAT I COULD SEE OUT,

25:10.777 --> 25:14.446
BUT ALL I COULD SEE
WAS MYSELF.

25:14.547 --> 25:18.350
AND I REMEMBER THINKING,
"BOTH ARMS, SOPHIE?

25:18.450 --> 25:21.888
DID IT HAVE
TO BE BOTH ARMS, YOU IDIOT?"

25:30.096 --> 25:32.064
OUR TIME IS UP.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.440
OKAY.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.611
WE'LL, UM--

25:44.711 --> 25:47.479
WE'LL TAKE IT UP THERE

25:47.580 --> 25:49.816
WHEN YOU COME BACK
NEXT WEEK.

25:49.916 --> 25:53.620
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO TRAINING CAMP WITH EVERYONE
ELSE IN THE UNIVERSE?

25:55.321 --> 25:57.924
I'LL GO GET YOUR CLOTHES

25:58.024 --> 26:00.292
AND CALL KATE.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.966
( door opens )

26:08.234 --> 26:11.871
HE DIDN'T OFFER YOU
A CUP OF TEA EVEN?

26:14.406 --> 26:16.843
ARE YOU SURE
THAT DOESN'T HURT?

26:19.278 --> 26:22.014
ALL RIGHT, YOU,

26:22.114 --> 26:24.817
ARMS WAY UP.

26:27.386 --> 26:29.288
OKAY.
( laughs )

26:29.388 --> 26:31.758
UM...

27:15.902 --> 27:18.905
( theme music playing )
