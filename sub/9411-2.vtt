If we increase the cathode charge

00:51.700 --> 00:54.200
we might get
a cleaner morphic image.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.700
The image is fine, Norman.

00:56.200 --> 01:00.000
It's a molecule detection light,
not a video camera.

I don't think this
is such a good idea.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Oh, come on,
when your parents are working,

01:16.333 --> 01:18.467
Why do you think
they call it Hedge House?

01:18.900 --> 01:23.033
Look, there's probably
no ghost in there anyways,

01:23.467 --> 01:24.967
so what's the point of going in?

01:24.967 --> 01:27.467

and we are going in.

to do too much, here, OK.

It's a rubber mask, Sam.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.233
You scare way too easy.

something invisible was wearing it.

into that house again.

16:21.800 --> 16:25.167
- You're not my friend.
- What are you saying, Sam?

16:25.667 --> 16:28.033
I'm saying
you're not my friend.

16:28.033 --> 16:28.967
You're my worst nightmare.

16:29.467 --> 16:32.467
I want you out of my house
and out of my life.

16:32.467 --> 16:34.500
Your exactly right Sam,
I'm not your friend.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I've never been your friend.
