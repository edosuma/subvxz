WEBVTT

00:00.066 --> 00:03.402
and we make it accessible to the
consumer, who's on the other side.

00:03.570 --> 00:06.989
We make the entire operation
totally discreet and professional.

00:07.157 --> 00:10.033
And, you know, we never forget
that it's a business.

00:10.201 --> 00:13.537
We make a real point of making sure
that we take good care of both

00:13.705 --> 00:16.707
the content provider
and the content subscriber.

00:16.875 --> 00:18.125
That's pretty much
how we try and do business.

00:18.293 --> 00:20.544
- Thank you, Jack.
- You got it. Have a good night.

00:20.712 --> 00:23.630
You know, the more time you spend
around all this stuff,

00:23.798 --> 00:27.676
the more normal it becomes.
It's a world without any filters.

00:27.844 --> 00:32.055
It may be crass and in your face, but
there is something very honest about it.

00:32.223 --> 00:35.058
The outside world
seems strange and mundane.

00:35.226 --> 00:38.812
You know that most of the
outside world is looking down on you,

00:38.980 --> 00:42.316
but you also know
at the exact same time,

00:42.484 --> 00:44.610
if they were really honest
with themselves,

00:44.778 --> 00:46.862
they'd kill to be
on the inside with you.

00:47.030 --> 00:48.322
There's Audrey Dawns.

00:48.490 --> 00:50.616
Hottest newbie starlet in the biz.

00:56.915 --> 01:00.375
After all these years,
everybody knew I was a family man.

01:00.543 --> 01:04.712
But the second I saw her,
I knew that I was in trouble.

01:04.881 --> 01:08.091
- Have you been on my site?
- I haven't, no.

01:09.135 --> 01:11.261
Well, I'm not like your other sites.
I only do solo girl.

01:11.429 --> 01:13.931
- Just me.
- What, do you got a guilty conscience?

01:14.098 --> 01:16.809
Guilt? No. Hell, no.

01:16.976 --> 01:20.312
I think people put too much
emphasis on guilt. You know?

01:20.480 --> 01:22.439
Like, I bet if you ask
any one of those old-timers

01:22.607 --> 01:24.399
in one of those old folks' homes,
they'll tell you

01:24.567 --> 01:27.027
they regret the stuff they didn't do,
not the stuff they did.

01:27.195 --> 01:29.363
- You only live once.
- Is that so?

01:29.531 --> 01:31.782
- Yeah.
- You ever feel like this partnership

01:31.950 --> 01:33.742
isn't such a real partnership?

01:35.161 --> 01:37.996
You mean like he's Mick Jagger
and we're a bunch of roadies?

01:38.164 --> 01:40.207
Yeah. We made that motherfucker.

01:40.375 --> 01:42.084
I'd like to be in business with you.

01:42.252 --> 01:46.255
- That I might regret.
- Why do you say that?

01:46.422 --> 01:47.881
'Cause I've been ripped off before.

01:50.677 --> 01:52.553
That wouldn't happen with me.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.471
- No?
- No, it wouldn't.

01:55.723 --> 01:57.140
Any chance you could
get me the money

01:57.308 --> 01:59.142
that's been ripped off
from me so far?

02:03.648 --> 02:06.441
Don't worry about it. We're rich.

02:06.943 --> 02:09.735
Well... rich and somebody's bitch.

02:13.992 --> 02:16.660
- Hey, Jack.
- Hi.

02:16.828 --> 02:19.621
Things seem to be going very well.

02:19.789 --> 02:24.501
Yeah. Yeah, things are good.
What are you doing here?

02:24.669 --> 02:28.505
I have a large variety of clients.

02:31.509 --> 02:33.343
Enlighten me here, Jack.

02:35.179 --> 02:37.639
- Why did you cut me out?
- I didn't cut you out.

02:37.807 --> 02:40.309
I gave you 200 grand up front,

02:40.476 --> 02:43.687
before I even knew a deal
was in place. Didn't I?

02:44.647 --> 02:46.690
- Yes. Yes, you did.
- OK.

02:47.859 --> 02:51.403
But... just look... look at you now.

02:52.447 --> 02:54.781
Jerry, you're under indictment.

02:54.949 --> 02:57.200
Please. Please, that'll never stick.

02:57.368 --> 02:59.161
'Cause you see, I'm... I'm just...

02:59.329 --> 03:01.330
I'm extremely smart.

03:01.497 --> 03:05.208
Just answer me, why are you...

03:05.376 --> 03:07.544
Why are you still hangin' around?

03:07.712 --> 03:11.089
I mean, it certainly isn't the money.

03:11.257 --> 03:12.883
Lord knows you have enough.

03:13.051 --> 03:15.802
You're not a greedy man, Jack.

03:15.970 --> 03:18.388
And for damn sure, it ain't the pussy.

03:18.556 --> 03:21.141
You... you're sort of a throwback.

03:21.309 --> 03:24.978
You're actually a faithful
and happily married man.

03:25.146 --> 03:27.481
So why, why is it?

03:28.942 --> 03:31.818
Jerry, why don't you just
enjoy the party, all right?

03:31.986 --> 03:35.822
- You think too much.
- I love... I love to think.

03:35.990 --> 03:39.826
And I... I love to hear my brain

03:39.994 --> 03:43.038
go clickity, clickity, click.

03:44.666 --> 03:46.583
Good to see you.

03:48.044 --> 03:49.920
Sure thing, Jack.

03:54.258 --> 03:57.719
- You don't want any?
- No.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:08.439 --> 04:12.818
Gentlemen. Gentlemen, hey,
get a hold of yourselves here.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.112
I wanna introduce you
to the legendary Denny Z.

04:15.279 --> 04:16.779
Hey, hey, hey.

04:16.947 --> 04:20.158
Denny Z was a bottom feeder
and a complete scumbag.

04:20.326 --> 04:22.953
The kind of person you'd be
embarrassed to spend time with.

04:23.121 --> 04:25.247
In this business, that's saying a lot.

04:25.415 --> 04:27.541
Yeah, I have some real interesting
ideas on the site's future, man.

04:27.709 --> 04:29.376
I want to set up a sick-ass portal

04:29.544 --> 04:30.752
- for premium members.
- Oh, yeah.

04:30.920 --> 04:33.964
You wanna let me finish?
Fucking cutting-edge shit, man.

04:34.132 --> 04:36.550
- I like what I'm hearing so far.
- Yeah, it sounds brilliant.

04:36.718 --> 04:39.136
- I haven't even said anything.
- Hey, hey. Let... Don't worry about it.

04:39.303 --> 04:41.638
Fuck the details.
I mean, the yak-yak-yak.

04:41.806 --> 04:43.557
Let's try to make a deal here,
all right?

04:43.725 --> 04:45.308
Denny Z, plus Haggerty,

04:45.476 --> 04:48.979
plus Buck and Wayne added up
badly any way you looked at it.

04:49.147 --> 04:52.566
They started their own secret deal
to make money behind my back.

04:52.734 --> 04:54.735
But, in typical
Buck and Wayne fashion,

04:54.902 --> 04:57.487
they had no idea what
they'd gotten themselves into.

04:57.655 --> 05:00.073
- You got anymore vodka suppositories?
- Come on.

05:09.834 --> 05:13.587
I hired some good new people,
got the place turned around,

05:13.755 --> 05:17.966
then my friend couldn't come back to
take it back over, so now it's mine.

05:18.134 --> 05:21.094
That's why he's got me.
See, if anybody steals from him,

05:21.262 --> 05:22.721
I go and kick their ass.

05:23.514 --> 05:25.849
I can't have any thieves
or crooks around here

05:26.017 --> 05:28.560
because I'm too busy
stealing from Jack myself.

05:30.313 --> 05:33.648
Like that motherfucker right there.
Excuse me.

05:40.198 --> 05:42.991
Hey, dawg. What do you
think you're doing?

05:43.159 --> 05:44.367
What you think you're doing?

05:44.535 --> 05:46.536
- I'm doing myjob.
- I saw that shit.

05:46.704 --> 05:48.455
All right, so let me guess.

05:48.623 --> 05:52.042
You... you start
to go home less and less.

05:52.210 --> 05:56.046
Your wife and kids
become total strangers,

05:56.214 --> 06:00.425
and now you find yourself
lonely and confused

06:00.593 --> 06:04.888
with a 23-year-old porn star.
Accurate?

06:05.056 --> 06:08.308
Well, I mean, I wouldn't exactly
call myself an absentee father.

06:08.476 --> 06:11.937
Sorry. I didn't mean to
strike a nerve or anything.

06:12.105 --> 06:15.398
- That's OK.
- It's the oldest story in the book.

06:15.566 --> 06:17.025
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:17.193 --> 06:19.569
It's a carbon copy
of my life growing up.

06:19.737 --> 06:21.696
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:21.864 --> 06:24.491
Absentee father working all the time.

06:24.659 --> 06:28.537
A self-obsessed mother,
50, trying to look 25.

06:28.704 --> 06:30.831
Eight Vicodins a day, drinks at noon.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.042
Her idea of a
well-rounded conversation

06:34.210 --> 06:38.839
usually consisted of questions like...
"Do I look puffy?"

07:15.459 --> 07:19.462
I just think you are so much
better than this world that you're in.

07:19.630 --> 07:21.173
What am I doing wrong, Diana?

07:21.340 --> 07:24.301
Come on. You don't know?
What am I supposed to tell people?

07:24.468 --> 07:27.304
I mean, how do you think I feel
that I can't tell anybody what you do?

07:27.471 --> 07:30.599
Why is it important to you that you
can tell people what I do for a living?

07:30.766 --> 07:33.977
Why is it not important to you?
That's what I wanna know.

07:34.145 --> 07:36.188
What about our children? How do
you think they're gonna handle it

07:36.355 --> 07:38.106
when they find out
what their daddy does?

07:38.274 --> 07:41.067
Well, if they've been raised right,
which I think they have,

07:41.235 --> 07:43.945
I just assume that they'll be OK,
which is all I care about.

07:44.113 --> 07:45.989
Well, you haven't really been
raising them, have you?

07:46.157 --> 07:48.700
Come on, you're never home, Jack.

07:48.868 --> 07:51.286
How would you know if
they're being raised right?

07:51.454 --> 07:53.997
Guess who that falls on?

08:13.226 --> 08:15.769
I'm sorry about today in the car.

08:15.937 --> 08:17.145
It's OK.

08:19.815 --> 08:21.483
Hey.

08:28.032 --> 08:29.991
I missed you so much.

08:36.039 --> 08:37.374
Jack.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.711
You feel good.

08:55.893 --> 08:56.935
Hey.

08:58.896 --> 09:01.064
Where you going?

09:01.232 --> 09:03.066
Come back here.

09:13.703 --> 09:15.203
Where are you?

09:17.748 --> 09:19.249
I don't know.

09:20.251 --> 09:23.044
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

09:24.088 --> 09:26.006
What do you mean you're sorry?

09:27.258 --> 09:28.883
Oh, my God.

09:31.470 --> 09:32.846
Let me out.

09:33.014 --> 09:36.266
Let me out. Let me out!

09:36.434 --> 09:38.393
Oh, my God.

09:46.027 --> 09:48.361
So I guess we're talking
about a divorce then, aren't we?

09:48.529 --> 09:52.198
What do you think?
We just go on like this?

09:52.366 --> 09:55.618
Oh, God, I despise this hypocrisy.

09:55.786 --> 09:57.871
I'm still in love with you, Diana.

09:58.039 --> 09:59.331
Bullshit.

09:59.498 --> 10:01.958
So now I'm flying back to LA,

10:02.126 --> 10:05.337
feeling like it's pretty much
over between me and Diana.

10:05.504 --> 10:08.048
She was right.
I wasn't there anymore.

10:08.215 --> 10:11.760
I'd become addicted to a lifestyle
of money, sex and power

10:11.927 --> 10:16.431
that was light years away from family
or anything I'd ever experienced.

10:16.599 --> 10:18.808
You see, the biggest problem
with my addiction,

10:18.976 --> 10:22.729
was that like all addictions,
it sneaks up on you slowly.

10:22.897 --> 10:27.650
You give into it incrementally,
in an almost imperceptible way.

10:27.818 --> 10:30.153
The other thing was it wasn't
the kind of addiction

10:30.321 --> 10:31.988
where you'd wake up with a hangover.

10:32.156 --> 10:34.616
It wasn't the kind of thing
that would rob you of your wealth.

10:34.784 --> 10:36.785
It didn't rob you of your health.

10:36.952 --> 10:40.705
The more I indulged,
the richer it would make me.

10:40.873 --> 10:44.667
I've got to tell you...
that's impossible to give up.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.475
I can hear your thoughts.

11:02.520 --> 11:05.146
I believe you.
You don't have to tell me.

11:10.152 --> 11:13.029
You like post-orgasm silence?

11:15.783 --> 11:17.200
Don't we all?

11:17.368 --> 11:20.495
You don't have to be mean
just because you feel so guilty.

11:20.663 --> 11:23.123
Do you need me to
let you off the hook?

11:27.378 --> 11:31.339
Despite what you think, you actually
don't have that kind of power over me.

11:31.507 --> 11:34.092
Don't kid yourself.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.094
I'm not.

11:36.262 --> 11:38.221
- I'm younger.
- Yeah.

11:38.389 --> 11:40.557
- I'm hotter.
- OK.

11:40.724 --> 11:45.103
And you like my pussy way more
'cause it's tighter and prettier.

11:49.608 --> 11:51.776
That's so poetic.

12:13.799 --> 12:15.800
You really know
all about this stuff?

12:15.968 --> 12:17.260
Yes.

12:17.428 --> 12:21.222
All right, so this shows
the horse's past performance.

12:21.390 --> 12:22.390
OK.

12:22.558 --> 12:25.101
And this indicates how much
the horse has run.

12:25.269 --> 12:27.103
See? This horse ran three times
in the last three weeks,

12:27.271 --> 12:28.229
so it's probably tired.

12:28.397 --> 12:30.190
- Yeah?
- We don't wanna bet on that one. 'Kay?

12:30.357 --> 12:32.150
- All right.
- And this horse here,

12:32.318 --> 12:33.776
it runs well on a sloppy track.

12:33.944 --> 12:35.904
So just 'cause a horse won
its last few races,

12:36.071 --> 12:38.239
doesn't mean it's gonna win
against a different class of horse.

12:38.407 --> 12:40.283
- You're really good at this.
- Thank you.

12:40.451 --> 12:41.784
You're welcome.

12:41.952 --> 12:46.289
- I'm sorry, I didn't order that.
- Courtesy of Mr. Sokoloff, sir.

12:46.457 --> 12:48.416
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

12:56.926 --> 12:57.967
I'll be right back.

13:04.975 --> 13:06.434
- Hey.
- You didn't have to do that.

13:06.602 --> 13:09.771
- Hey, come, come.
- Thank you.

13:09.939 --> 13:12.065
Did you know that
the FBI is following you?

13:12.233 --> 13:14.317
- What?
- Don't look now.

13:14.485 --> 13:17.654
Don't move. Don't react.

13:18.489 --> 13:21.533
I'm just telling you that those men,

13:21.700 --> 13:25.995
sitting at a table,
you can see them over my head,

13:26.163 --> 13:28.623
they are with the FBI.

13:28.791 --> 13:31.960
Organized Crime task force.

13:32.127 --> 13:37.090
I know them because they practically
put me to bed every night.

13:37.258 --> 13:40.009
What makes you so sure
they're following me?

13:40.177 --> 13:42.220
And what makes you
so sure they're not?

13:43.347 --> 13:45.014
They're also terrible actors.

13:45.182 --> 13:48.935
They stick out like sore thumb,
don't you think?

13:49.103 --> 13:51.437
That doesn't mean
they're following me.

13:51.605 --> 13:57.318
Do you see that guy standing
above them? See him?

13:57.486 --> 13:59.529
The one on the cell phone?

13:59.697 --> 14:00.989
That's my cousin Yuri.

14:01.156 --> 14:03.533
They follow me, he follows them.

14:03.701 --> 14:06.160
He just called me a few seconds ago

14:06.328 --> 14:10.206
and he said, they were talking
about you. Not about me.

14:10.374 --> 14:12.584
Isn't that refreshing?

14:13.711 --> 14:17.338
Maybe they tuck you in tonight?

14:17.506 --> 14:20.883
They have no reason to follow me.
I'm just a businessman.

14:21.051 --> 14:23.261
Aren't we all?

14:28.976 --> 14:31.269
- Hi, baby.
- You know her?

14:31.437 --> 14:35.398
Yes. I know her.
She danced at my clubs.

14:36.692 --> 14:39.319
Nice girl. Very nice girl.

14:45.075 --> 14:46.743
How do you know Niki?

14:46.910 --> 14:50.371
We did some business
together a few years ago.

14:50.539 --> 14:52.415
Yeah? Me, too.

14:52.583 --> 14:54.792
Yeah, he said you danced
at one of his clubs.

14:56.420 --> 15:00.006
Yep. His scumbag lawyer is the one
responsible for me losing all that money

15:00.174 --> 15:01.591
- on my site.
- What do you mean?

15:01.759 --> 15:03.801
Nikita set me up with
his lawyer to do my contracts

15:03.969 --> 15:06.721
when I first started my site.
He really fucked me over.

15:06.889 --> 15:08.931
- I don't understand.
- Jerry Haggerty.

15:09.099 --> 15:11.392
- Yeah?
- Fucking scumbag.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.770
Jerry Haggerty is Nikita's lawyer?

15:13.937 --> 15:16.022
- Nikita something.
- Sokoloff?

15:16.190 --> 15:17.440
I think that sounds about right.

15:17.608 --> 15:20.276
Yep. Why, do you know him?

15:24.031 --> 15:26.449
Let's go. Gotta get out of here.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.293
- Where's Jerry?
- Hey, Jack.

15:37.461 --> 15:39.587
What a surprise.

15:39.755 --> 15:41.464
You're Sokoloff's lawyer?

15:41.632 --> 15:43.633
- Sorry?
- You heard me, Jerry.

15:43.801 --> 15:46.844
Now, Jack you know I can't
disclose who my clients are.

15:47.012 --> 15:50.306
- That's attorney-client privilege.
- Why are you fuckin' with me, Jerry?

15:50.474 --> 15:53.476
OK, then, yeah.
Yeah. Don't be moronic.

15:53.644 --> 15:56.145
Of course I'm his lawyer.
I mean, how do you think I found out

15:56.313 --> 15:58.356
about this situation in the first place?

15:58.524 --> 15:59.649
You ripped me off.

15:59.817 --> 16:02.235
In God's name,
what are you talking about?

16:02.403 --> 16:05.446
The big fucking Russian Ivan.
That was you, I know that was you.

16:05.614 --> 16:08.324
He shows up at my house
demanding double what I owed him.

16:08.492 --> 16:10.993
- Some of that was meant for you.
- Yeah, so? So? So what?

16:11.161 --> 16:14.997
So, I'm trying to take a little skim,
for Christ's sakes?

16:15.165 --> 16:18.251
I mean, and you're making what?
Close to 1 00 million?

16:18.419 --> 16:20.628
And what, you throw me
a tuna fish sandwich?

16:21.880 --> 16:24.632
That ain't right. That ain't right.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.260
And then, so... so tell me,
what... what do I get?

16:27.428 --> 16:29.679
"Thanks for putting
this all together, Jerry."

16:29.847 --> 16:33.266
That ain't right,
and you know it, motherfucker.

16:33.434 --> 16:36.352
I took care of you, OK?
I've paid my debt to you.

16:36.520 --> 16:37.854
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

16:38.021 --> 16:42.525
Yeah, well, see, the problem is
I don't really see it like that, Jack.

16:42.693 --> 16:45.194
Listen, I'm serious.
All right? We're finished.

16:45.362 --> 16:48.489
No. No, you see, we're not finished.

16:48.657 --> 16:49.741
Yeah, we are, Jerry.

16:49.908 --> 16:53.327
We can't be.
Listen, you killed Ivan, right?

16:55.831 --> 16:59.667
- What did you just say to me?
- Well, I mean you had to kill him.

16:59.835 --> 17:04.672
The man's gone. I mean,
he was here, and then he's gone.

17:04.839 --> 17:07.717
I mean, vanished.
Disappeared. Like in thin air.

17:07.885 --> 17:10.636
It seems pretty obvious
that he took the money and left.

17:10.804 --> 17:14.598
Yes. Yes, see I...
I thought that too for a while.

17:14.767 --> 17:20.730
But I don't think this guy would
have just run off with $450,000.

17:20.897 --> 17:24.817
I mean, he might try to start a new life
with four or five million, you know,

17:24.984 --> 17:26.903
but not that kind of chump change.

17:27.069 --> 17:30.281
So, you see, it just doesn't
make any sense to me, Jack.

17:30.449 --> 17:33.576
So you had to have
something to do with it.

17:33.744 --> 17:37.747
Jerry, if you even suspected that
was the truth, you'd be bleeding me dry.

17:37.915 --> 17:42.752
Sure. But I might be looking
to catch a bigger fish.

17:42.920 --> 17:46.756
Listen, if you even think about
repeating this conversation to anybody,

17:46.924 --> 17:50.760
even in jest, I swear to God,
I'll throw you off a fucking roof.

17:52.387 --> 17:54.597
I didn't kill anybody.

17:54.765 --> 17:55.890
Sure thing, Jack.

17:56.058 --> 17:57.934
You oughta calm down a little.

17:58.101 --> 18:00.478
I mean, we're just a couple
of guys talking here.

18:06.068 --> 18:08.486
I just wanted to carve
out a moment of peace,

18:08.654 --> 18:11.614
to close my eyes
and dream up a solution.

18:11.782 --> 18:13.616
Something really romantic,

18:13.784 --> 18:15.827
like Haggerty getting hit by a bus,

18:15.994 --> 18:19.580
or Wayne and Buck
spontaneously combusting.

18:19.748 --> 18:22.458
What I heard next, I could not believe.

18:22.626 --> 18:24.544
- Guess what?
- What?

18:24.711 --> 18:26.379
The FBI was just here.

18:27.923 --> 18:29.715
Why?

18:29.883 --> 18:32.802
Do you know anything
about terrorism, Audrey?

18:36.056 --> 18:39.600
What kind of terrorism
are you referring to?

18:39.768 --> 18:42.645
Do you mean like
national, international,

18:42.813 --> 18:46.691
eco, bio or just your
everyday suicide bomber?

18:49.152 --> 18:51.445
Middle Eastern terrorists, Audrey.

18:54.950 --> 18:57.243
Audrey, we've come to you today
with an opportunity

18:57.411 --> 19:01.330
that very few Americans
have ever had in history.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.377
It turns out you have several
high-ranking members

19:06.545 --> 19:11.591
of a terrorist organization
who are huge fans of your website.

19:15.554 --> 19:17.013
Really?

19:17.180 --> 19:20.016
Apparently, some terrorist in Hamburg

19:20.183 --> 19:22.810
that Interpol was on the hunt for
was obsessed with Audrey.

19:22.978 --> 19:25.563
It turned out they could
literally track his whereabouts

19:25.731 --> 19:28.816
when he logged onto the site. Now,
he likes Audrey's website so much,

19:28.984 --> 19:32.028
he emails another
terrorist in Afghanistan...

19:32.195 --> 19:34.363
...who emails another in Pakistan.

19:34.531 --> 19:37.366
Pretty soon, you've got
a worldwide terrorist circle jerk,

19:37.534 --> 19:39.160
all because of Audrey's site.

19:40.162 --> 19:43.039
The Navy was scrambling fighters
off the decks of aircraft carriers...

19:43.206 --> 19:46.334
...whenever Audrey Dawns
was doing her thing.

20:01.224 --> 20:03.267
They didn't think
we'd be willing to help them.

20:03.435 --> 20:06.354
I think they were trying to figure out
a way to force you into it,

20:06.521 --> 20:09.315
but they didn't have
anything compromising on you.

20:09.483 --> 20:11.567
- This is crazy, isn't it?
- I know.

20:11.735 --> 20:13.986
I mean, we're gonna be like...

20:14.321 --> 20:17.531
We're gonna be like spies,
working for the government.

20:17.699 --> 20:19.075
It turns me on!

20:19.242 --> 20:20.409
It was all so crazy.

20:20.577 --> 20:24.038
A 23-year-old porn star was
about to become a major component

20:24.206 --> 20:26.165
in America's war on terror.

20:27.042 --> 20:28.584
Now, at the same time,

20:28.752 --> 20:31.921
Buck and Wayne finally put
together what Denny Z was up to

20:32.089 --> 20:33.589
with their new secret website.

20:33.757 --> 20:36.634
What do you mean? What do you
mean "under 1 8"? How do you know?

20:36.802 --> 20:38.678
I'm telling you,
I saw it with my own eyes.

20:38.845 --> 20:42.056
These girls are underage.
You need to confront this, Wayne.

20:42.224 --> 20:44.266
I saw fuckin' pigtails,
I saw little fucking girls.

20:44.434 --> 20:47.186
Shit, this is not good, man.
I can't believe he fucked us like that.

20:47.354 --> 20:49.563
He totally fucked us!
25 years to life! He fucked us!

20:49.731 --> 20:51.399
Oh, no. I'm not going to prison. Oh, no.

20:51.566 --> 20:53.150
We gotta get the fuck
out of the country, right now.

20:53.318 --> 20:54.610
Call a chopper, land on the roof,

20:54.778 --> 20:57.446
chopper out to Van Nuys Airport
and take the jet down to Cambodia.

20:57.614 --> 20:59.949
- You're getting way ahead of yourself.
- We gotta get the fuck out.

21:00.117 --> 21:02.243
We need to demand Denny Z
fucking disable this site!

21:02.411 --> 21:04.036
And we need to fucking say nothing.

21:04.204 --> 21:06.747
- I'm not going to prison.
- We're not fucking pedophiles, man.

21:06.915 --> 21:10.126
- Yeah, tell that to the judge.
- Judge, we're not fucking pedophiles.

21:10.293 --> 21:12.294
OK.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.466
- Hey, guys, the FBI is here.
- What?

21:17.634 --> 21:19.885
Yeah, they're up there talking to Jack.

21:23.807 --> 21:24.932
- Terrorists?
- Correct.

21:25.100 --> 21:26.642
- And Audrey?
- Right.

21:26.810 --> 21:30.021
We've been able to confirm that

21:30.188 --> 21:32.773
these terrorists have very
specific viewing patterns.

21:33.775 --> 21:34.817
They're men.

21:35.736 --> 21:36.944
For example...

21:38.530 --> 21:42.241
...we have found that
they very much enjoy

21:42.409 --> 21:47.997
solo or girl-on-girl,
much more than the hardcore.

21:48.165 --> 21:52.835
I mean, they'll watch it,
but they're incredibly homophobic.

21:54.004 --> 21:55.463
Another example.

21:55.630 --> 22:00.009
They enjoy sites that have,
and this is a surprise to no one,

22:00.177 --> 22:03.054
- a military theme.
- Military themes?

22:03.221 --> 22:05.765
Girls posing with guns and the like.

22:05.932 --> 22:09.310
What your government
is recommending...

22:10.103 --> 22:16.067
We recommend Audrey create
a new section on her site

22:16.234 --> 22:20.196
- with a separate payment method.
- A portal.

22:20.363 --> 22:23.324
This will allow us to hone our efforts.

22:23.492 --> 22:25.534
- What are they fucking doing?
- They're just talking.

22:25.702 --> 22:28.204
I'm freaking the fuck out.
I'm not going to prison.

22:29.664 --> 22:31.207
Oh, fuck!

22:31.374 --> 22:33.501
...on their specific viewing,

22:33.668 --> 22:37.713
much more so using
said portal through you.

22:39.674 --> 22:42.093
And we believe this to be
the key to our success.

22:43.512 --> 22:46.055
Oh, of course. Anything I can
do to help, I'll be glad to.

22:46.223 --> 22:49.475
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God,
he's shaking their hands. Oh, fuck.

22:49.643 --> 22:52.019
I'm fucking telling you,
he fucking called 'em!

22:52.187 --> 22:55.898
So now these idiots think I'm
conspiring with the Feds against them.

22:56.066 --> 22:58.609
Of course, I had no idea
what was going on.

22:58.777 --> 23:00.736
They go into a full-blown panic,

23:00.904 --> 23:03.656
and of all the people
in the world to confide in,

23:03.824 --> 23:04.740
who do they go see?

23:14.042 --> 23:17.169
Listen. I gotta tell you,
you guys really piss me off.

23:17.337 --> 23:21.006
I'm pissed off because every time
you have a problem, you come to me.

23:21.174 --> 23:23.551
It's never, "Hey, Jerry,
you wanna go have some dinner,"

23:23.718 --> 23:26.720
or, "We're doing well,
now here's a little gift for you

23:26.888 --> 23:28.514
because without you,
we would have nothing."

23:28.682 --> 23:31.016
No, but if you got Russians
that are looking to kill you

23:31.184 --> 23:33.269
or you're worried about the FBI

23:33.436 --> 23:35.312
because you got a 16-year-old
on your website...

23:35.480 --> 23:36.939
OK, OK.

23:37.107 --> 23:39.150
...I immediately become
your best friend. Right?

23:39.317 --> 23:41.735
- It's not like that. That's not true.
- Well, bullshit.

23:41.903 --> 23:45.322
- So, how bad is it?
- Minors fucking on your website?

23:45.490 --> 23:47.283
It's not very good, to be honest.

23:47.450 --> 23:51.203
It's not like it's kiddie porn.
The girls are 16 or 1 7...

23:51.371 --> 23:52.454
You know, we gotta keep it down.

23:52.622 --> 23:55.457
- The girls are 16 or 1 7 years old.
- I see.

23:55.625 --> 23:58.961
But I'm not sure that the government
shares your sense of nuance there.

23:59.129 --> 24:01.213
- What do we do?
- We? You got a turd in your pocket?

24:01.381 --> 24:03.465
First thing you two
rocket scientists gotta do

24:03.633 --> 24:05.634
is get rid of that creepy Denny Z.

24:05.802 --> 24:07.469
You gotta get as far away
from that as possible.

24:07.637 --> 24:08.929
- What?
- Buck called him already.

24:09.097 --> 24:10.347
- Denny Z?
- Yeah.

24:10.515 --> 24:12.099
You're the guy that
put us in touch with him,

24:12.267 --> 24:13.475
told us to get into business with him.

24:13.643 --> 24:16.478
I wanna introduce you
to the legendary Denny Z.

24:16.646 --> 24:18.981
- That I don't recall.
- That's fucked up.

24:19.149 --> 24:20.774
You don't remember that?

24:24.946 --> 24:26.405
Respectfully, it's fucked up.

24:26.573 --> 24:28.282
But it's rather irrelevant now,
isn't it?

24:28.450 --> 24:30.784
I think it's relevant.
I mean, you did introduce us to him.

24:32.287 --> 24:34.622
Nobody likes a finger pointed at them.

24:34.789 --> 24:38.334
Nobody. And I demand the same respect
that I show you two jerk-offs.

24:38.501 --> 24:40.044
Jerry, how do we make this disappear?

24:40.212 --> 24:42.463
That's another "we."
Let me ask you a question,

24:42.631 --> 24:44.006
what are you guys worth now?

24:44.174 --> 24:46.508
Well, it's kind of
hard to keep track of.

24:46.676 --> 24:50.429
Well, give me a rough. Like an estimate.
Maybe, what, 1 00 million?

24:50.597 --> 24:53.015
- Maybe something in that area?
- It's more like 50.

24:53.183 --> 24:55.184
- A hundred, 200 million.
- It's more like 50.

24:55.352 --> 24:57.186
- About a hundred million.
- And, you know, God forbid,

24:57.354 --> 24:59.647
you never thought of giving me
a little piece of that?

24:59.814 --> 25:01.690
In the beginning, Jack said
you were under indictment.

25:01.858 --> 25:05.861
Hey, fuck Jack.
And that little plan of yours

25:06.029 --> 25:07.655
apparently didn't go so well.

25:07.822 --> 25:09.865
You've got FBI looking up
your ass right now.

25:10.033 --> 25:11.867
How about...
how about the three of us?

25:12.035 --> 25:14.495
- We work together, make a partnership.
- Yeah, yeah.

25:14.663 --> 25:15.788
- Now, what about Jack?
- Fuck Jack.

25:15.956 --> 25:18.207
- I said that.
- We'll deal with him.

25:18.375 --> 25:20.042
All right.
The first thing you gotta do

25:20.210 --> 25:22.503
is get rid of that goddamn website.

25:22.671 --> 25:25.214
Then maybe I can help
straighten things out for you.

25:25.382 --> 25:28.300
Thank you very much. Thank you for
everything. You've been a real friend.

25:28.468 --> 25:29.885
- Sure.
- I'm sorry.

25:30.053 --> 25:32.388
- I actually gotta take a shit.
- Sit the fuck down.

25:33.348 --> 25:34.431
Oh, forget about it.

25:34.599 --> 25:37.559
So Buck and Wayne told Haggerty
they'd shut the site down.

25:37.727 --> 25:40.062
What happened next you won't believe.

25:40.230 --> 25:41.981
They just simply forgot.

25:42.148 --> 25:47.403
Listen, I would like to say something
and it's from the bottom of my heart.

25:47.570 --> 25:53.242
I would be extremely unhappy if,
let's say, I got blindsided

25:53.410 --> 25:55.244
and I wound up in court with you two.

25:55.412 --> 25:58.539
So I wanna ask, are you sure,

25:58.707 --> 26:02.418
absolutely sure, that you've told me
everything that there is to know?

26:07.966 --> 26:11.093
- There's an unnecessary pause here.
- No, no, no no, no, no. Jerry.

26:11.261 --> 26:14.638
Jerry, we will never
do that to you again. OK?

26:17.100 --> 26:19.268
Do not ever fuck with me.

26:19.436 --> 26:20.853
- Jerry, Jerry...
- Fuck!

26:21.021 --> 26:22.604
Do you understand?

26:22.772 --> 26:25.607
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:25.775 --> 26:27.234
And before you know it,

26:27.402 --> 26:30.237
Buck and Wayne told Haggerty
about the dead Russian.

26:30.405 --> 26:34.825
Every last detail about how
james accidentally killed Ivan.

26:34.993 --> 26:36.160
They didn't get their money!

26:36.328 --> 26:39.830
Now, Haggerty's got me
in the worst possible position.

26:51.801 --> 26:54.053
- Yeah?
- Your son's been arrested.

26:57.015 --> 27:00.142
- What?
- Your son has been arrested, Jack.

27:00.310 --> 27:01.643
What happened? What did he do?

27:01.811 --> 27:03.604
Maybe if you were around
a little bit, you'd know.

27:03.772 --> 27:08.067
Our oldest son, Michael, decided he
didn't care for his grades that semester

27:08.234 --> 27:11.779
so he hacked into the school's computer
system and changed them to his liking.

27:11.946 --> 27:14.073
Now, even though
our marriage was over,

27:14.240 --> 27:17.201
Diana and I always came together
for our children.

27:17.369 --> 27:21.330
Even if we couldn't be a couple,
we were always gonna be a family.

27:21.498 --> 27:24.833
So, we went to visit the
headmaster at the school.

27:25.001 --> 27:27.086
And after some serious discussion,

27:27.253 --> 27:30.506
and a generous donation
to the new gymnasium,

27:30.673 --> 27:32.508
he decided to drop the charges.

27:32.675 --> 27:33.801
What did you have in mind?

27:33.968 --> 27:35.636
But that wasn't enough.

27:35.804 --> 27:37.805
The Houston District Attorney,
Frank Griffin,

27:37.972 --> 27:41.517
decided to proceed with the charges
anyway. So I paid him a visit.

27:43.019 --> 27:44.978
Hi. Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir.

27:45.146 --> 27:48.607
Do you have an appointment?
Sir. Excuse me, sir.

27:48.775 --> 27:52.403
- Jack Harris.
- Sorry, Mr. Griffin. He walked past.

27:52.570 --> 27:53.862
That's OK, gingersnap.

27:54.030 --> 27:55.697
- May I?
- Please.

27:55.865 --> 27:57.241
Thanks.

27:58.993 --> 28:02.121
So... my lawyers
tell me we need to talk.

28:02.288 --> 28:04.790
I know who you are and I'm not gonna
change my position, Mr. Harris.

28:04.958 --> 28:08.043
Your son's committed a very serious
crime, and although he may be a minor,

28:08.211 --> 28:11.046
the state of Texas intends to prosecute
him to the full extent of the law.

28:11.214 --> 28:14.133
Mr. Griffin, he's just a kid.

28:14.300 --> 28:17.886
He made a stupid mistake
and I've reprimanded him, severely.

28:18.054 --> 28:21.557
With all due respect, sir, the school
doesn't even wanna press charges.

28:21.724 --> 28:23.559
Do we really need to go
forward with all this?

28:23.726 --> 28:26.145
Harris, let me lay it all out for you.

28:26.312 --> 28:29.815
There are people, voters,

28:29.983 --> 28:32.818
upstanding people,
to whom I am responsible.

28:32.986 --> 28:34.069
I have to answer to them.

28:34.237 --> 28:36.238
And they want to see him
tried for this?

28:36.406 --> 28:39.908
Well, maybe the acorn doesn't
fall too far from the tree.

28:40.076 --> 28:43.412
So that's what this is all about?
This is more about me than my son?

28:43.580 --> 28:46.248
We all know what you do for a living.
You deal in pornography.

28:46.416 --> 28:49.334
- I run a billing company.
- But you deal with pornography.

28:49.502 --> 28:52.421
Like any hotel chain,
like any satellite or cable company.

28:52.589 --> 28:54.882
- I'm just a middle man.
- I'm not gonna play semantics.

28:55.049 --> 28:58.093
You're a pornographer. You peddle
pornography over the Internet.

28:58.261 --> 29:01.638
I think we're getting off the subject.
Let's focus on why we're here.

29:05.852 --> 29:06.894
What's this?

29:07.061 --> 29:09.813
Here, I'll give you a hand with it.
Let's see, OK.

29:09.981 --> 29:13.734
Yeah. YoungTightPussy.com.

29:13.902 --> 29:16.445
SplendorInTheAss.com.

29:16.613 --> 29:21.283
BlacksOnBlondes.com. This is
your billing record, Mr. Griffin.

29:21.451 --> 29:23.035
Take a look at it.

29:27.457 --> 29:32.127
Now, God forbid this
should wind up in here

29:32.295 --> 29:34.087
and fall into the wrong hands.

29:34.255 --> 29:35.631
It'd be on the cover
of tomorrow's paper.

29:35.798 --> 29:38.383
Can you imagine what that would
do to a campaign in this city?

29:38.551 --> 29:41.136
Especially the campaign
of a man whose voter base

29:41.304 --> 29:44.306
is a bunch of good, God-fearing
Christian conservatives?

29:44.474 --> 29:47.100
I mean... that'd be terrible.

29:52.982 --> 29:55.484
You realize you just attempted
to blackmail an officer of the court

29:55.652 --> 29:57.819
and a publicly elected
Texas state official?

29:59.989 --> 30:01.323
And it worked.

30:01.491 --> 30:03.575
I'm assuming you can
clear up this mess.

30:03.743 --> 30:06.161
I'll be glad to handle this
bump in the road for your son.

30:06.329 --> 30:07.955
- Great.
- Can I count on your vote next year?

30:08.122 --> 30:09.081
You got it.

30:09.249 --> 30:12.000
The power of the
Internet is truly amazing.

30:19.092 --> 30:21.885
Well, come hell or high water,
you get it done, don't you?

30:22.053 --> 30:23.387
I try.

30:23.555 --> 30:26.640
There's a part of me that hates
what you did to that man.

30:29.477 --> 30:32.229
There's also a part of me that just...

30:32.397 --> 30:35.357
I miss being protected
by you like that.

30:37.026 --> 30:38.819
Oh, God, I'm confused.

30:38.987 --> 30:42.322
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
- Just get out, Jack.

30:43.866 --> 30:45.200
I'll call you when I get there.

30:59.841 --> 31:03.594
When I was looking for dirt on the DA,
I came across this site here.

31:03.761 --> 31:05.178
- It's a Denny Z site.
- Yep.

31:05.346 --> 31:07.514
- You're not gonna like this.
- What?

31:07.682 --> 31:10.100
It's under Buck and Wayne's domain.

31:12.270 --> 31:14.813
- Shit.
- It gets worse.

31:22.363 --> 31:24.072
With glass dildos?
We can make that happen.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.783
- And I'll personally hire Santa.
- We have developed a new...

31:26.951 --> 31:29.077
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?!
What the fuck's wrong with you?

31:29.245 --> 31:30.537
Underage girls!

31:31.706 --> 31:33.707
- Where is he?!
- We didn't know. I didn't know.

31:33.875 --> 31:35.584
- Jack!
- He's at the Reseda house,

31:35.752 --> 31:36.752
where they shoot everything.

31:36.919 --> 31:39.004
Come on, we were gonna tell you.
We were in way over our heads!

31:39.172 --> 31:40.797
Jack, Z fucked us!

31:40.965 --> 31:42.424
Denny Z fucked all of us!

32:30.807 --> 32:32.641
What the fuck are you doing, man?

32:34.644 --> 32:37.562
Fucking son of a bitch!

32:39.107 --> 32:41.149
I'll have you fucking killed, you prick!

32:41.317 --> 32:43.151
Get the fuck out of my house!

32:45.363 --> 32:46.988
What the fuck are you gonna do?

32:47.156 --> 32:48.782
What the fuck?

32:48.950 --> 32:50.701
Fuck!

32:52.328 --> 32:56.665
Son of a bitch! Call 91 1 !

32:56.833 --> 32:58.333
Cocksucker!

33:52.805 --> 33:53.805
Hey.

33:56.642 --> 33:57.893
What's up with you?

34:02.565 --> 34:05.567
You know, I used to sit
at the table with my family.

34:06.444 --> 34:08.069
Is this the old-fashioned Jack?

34:08.237 --> 34:11.572
Old-fashioned?
Families are old-fashioned?

34:11.741 --> 34:13.867
I think families are overrated.

34:16.204 --> 34:20.623
You ever get the feeling that there's
a part of ourselves we just turn off?

34:21.667 --> 34:25.170
- Which part is that?
- I feel like it's the part that...

34:26.755 --> 34:29.882
...tells us this kind of
behavior is wrong.

34:31.594 --> 34:33.762
Some of the things that we're doing...

34:33.929 --> 34:36.389
You're gonna start moralizing?

34:38.016 --> 34:39.141
No.

34:39.310 --> 34:41.228
Jack, you have made all this money

34:41.395 --> 34:42.978
because of all the horny,
frustrated guys out there

34:43.147 --> 34:45.148
who have to jerk off because
their wives or their girlfriends

34:45.315 --> 34:48.777
don't treat them right. So...
so I become their little fantasy girl

34:48.945 --> 34:52.781
for five bucks a pop and make 'em
forget for a fleeting fuckin' instant

34:52.949 --> 34:55.492
that their wives and kids can't
stand the fuckin' sight of them.

34:55.659 --> 34:58.745
So, no, I don't have guilt for that.

34:58.913 --> 34:59.871
You're lucky.

35:00.039 --> 35:03.792
And my soul is perfectly fucking intact.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.920
- That's good.
- Yeah.

35:09.131 --> 35:11.591
You know what I'm starting to think?

35:11.759 --> 35:13.760
I'm starting to think
you're full of shit.

35:13.928 --> 35:15.804
You are so fucking full of shit.

35:17.306 --> 35:18.473
I don't fuckin' need to be here.

35:18.641 --> 35:21.101
Why? Tell me why,
why do I have to be here?

35:21.269 --> 35:24.646
So you can get a call in the middle of
the night from your fucking bitchy wife,

35:24.814 --> 35:27.315
your fucking Texas bitchy fucking wife,

35:27.483 --> 35:29.526
saying that one of your
spoiled fucking kids

35:29.694 --> 35:32.153
can't make it to the prep school
fucking homecoming?

35:32.989 --> 35:35.574
Your bags are packed, Audrey.

35:43.040 --> 35:43.999
Why?

35:44.166 --> 35:47.335
We don't belong anywhere
near each other, that's why.

35:47.503 --> 35:52.841
I'm sorry, I... I didn't mean
what I said about your family.

35:53.009 --> 35:57.178
I'm sorry, Jack. Just, please
don't do this to me. Please.

35:57.346 --> 36:01.266
Please, please.
Please don't do this to me.

36:03.185 --> 36:05.562
I'll do what you want.
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

36:05.730 --> 36:07.772
I'll be whatever you
want me to be, Jack. Please.

36:07.940 --> 36:09.691
Can't.

36:15.031 --> 36:17.115
Fine. Fine.

36:17.283 --> 36:19.659
Fucking fine!

36:46.312 --> 36:48.647
- Yeah?
- jack, it's Allmans.

36:48.814 --> 36:50.857
- I gotta see you.
- Can it wait?

36:51.025 --> 36:52.776
It can't wait an hour.

36:58.616 --> 37:01.242
Thanks for coming, Jack.

37:01.410 --> 37:04.037
You wanna lift up your arms for me
if you wouldn't mind, please?

37:04.205 --> 37:06.081
Why?

37:06.248 --> 37:08.249
I just gotta make sure
you're not wearin' a wire.

37:08.417 --> 37:10.126
Why the hell would I wear a wire?

37:10.294 --> 37:13.254
Have a seat, Jack.
I'm here to help you.

37:13.422 --> 37:17.592
I just can't risk getting
compromised in that process.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.428
Forgive me for takin' the
battery out of your phone here.

37:20.596 --> 37:25.016
You're a stand-up guy, Jack.
Your country owes you.

37:26.268 --> 37:30.105
Case in point, two nights ago,

37:30.272 --> 37:32.857
several top-ranking terrorists

37:33.025 --> 37:35.610
were taken out in a fire fight
in Afghanistan.

37:35.778 --> 37:38.446
Several arrests
were made in Europe, Indonesia.

37:38.614 --> 37:41.950
All told about 1 00 rounded up.
And in no small part, thanks to you.

37:42.118 --> 37:46.287
So when I found out about this other
thing, the least I could do is warn you.

37:46.455 --> 37:47.664
Warn me about what?

37:47.832 --> 37:49.416
One of our
investigators has confirmed

37:49.583 --> 37:52.627
the use of underage girls
on one of your websites.

37:55.172 --> 37:58.591
- Jesus.
- Yeah, it's bad, Jack.

37:58.759 --> 38:00.427
Any way you cut it,
it's child pornography,

38:00.594 --> 38:02.470
which means you're indicted
and you go to jail.

38:02.638 --> 38:06.099
I got nothing to do with
that website, you know that?

38:06.267 --> 38:08.601
I do know that.

38:08.769 --> 38:10.103
But you got partners.

38:16.819 --> 38:18.445
OK.

38:20.573 --> 38:22.323
What am I supposed
to do about this warning?

38:22.491 --> 38:24.492
Get out, now, yesterday if possible.

38:24.660 --> 38:27.078
- I can't.
- Sure you can.

38:31.667 --> 38:36.004
If by "I can't," you're referring
to this mess, let's talk about it.

38:36.172 --> 38:37.464
How you boys doing tonight?

38:37.631 --> 38:39.841
One of your ex-bouncers
was busted for drugs

38:40.009 --> 38:43.303
a couple of months ago and told us
a story about Ivan Sokoloff,

38:43.471 --> 38:45.764
nephew of Nikita Sokoloff,

38:45.931 --> 38:49.225
being murdered in your
living room five years ago.

38:49.393 --> 38:52.270
Said bouncer also witnessed you
dumping the body in the ocean

38:52.438 --> 38:54.022
off the coast of Catalina.

38:54.190 --> 38:57.067
It's myjob to know when
people are lying to me, Jack.

38:57.234 --> 38:58.359
He wasn't.

39:00.529 --> 39:03.281
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

39:03.449 --> 39:06.201
I guess that's what I'd say.

39:06.368 --> 39:09.704
But I'm here to help you, so let me
tell you what I think happened.

39:09.872 --> 39:11.456
You're out here, you got strong-armed.

39:11.624 --> 39:13.374
I don't know, maybe you're
doing somebody a favor,

39:13.542 --> 39:16.211
but you got here and realized you
could make a quick buck and get out.

39:16.378 --> 39:19.547
But then you got partnered
with these idiots,

39:19.715 --> 39:22.217
who now you can't trust because
they're hanging this Sokoloff thing

39:22.384 --> 39:26.805
over your head. Listen, I don't
give a shit that Ivan is dead.

39:26.972 --> 39:28.389
We, your government,

39:28.557 --> 39:31.851
celebrates when a piece of shit
like this no longer breathes.

39:32.019 --> 39:35.230
But this child pornography thing...

39:35.397 --> 39:38.149
...that doesn't go away, Jack.
That's you in prison.

39:43.572 --> 39:47.283
So, I mean, what am I supposed to do?
I mean, I can't go back in time.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.204
You did your government a solid.

39:51.372 --> 39:55.834
That's why you're getting the warning.
The rest is up to you to figure out.

40:23.654 --> 40:25.697
- Honey!
- Diana, what's going on?

40:25.865 --> 40:27.740
- They took him!
- What?

40:27.908 --> 40:29.159
They took him!

40:32.913 --> 40:34.706
Boys! Come on.

40:44.425 --> 40:46.885
You call police, we kill your boy.

40:47.052 --> 40:49.387
Better call your husband instead.

41:03.277 --> 41:06.321
- Yeah?
- jack. I have your son.

41:06.488 --> 41:08.656
Don't fuck around with me.

41:08.824 --> 41:11.659
I will call you tonight
with what I want.

41:11.827 --> 41:16.080
I got it. All right? I'm on my way.
Just don't do anything, all right?

41:16.248 --> 41:17.832
Good.

41:28.177 --> 41:31.012
- What the hell is this?
- This is the boy.

41:31.180 --> 41:32.680
- What?
- This is boy from house.

41:32.848 --> 41:34.849
- What the hell are you talking about?
- That's not Jack's kid.

41:35.017 --> 41:37.518
That child is Mexican.
That's Alejandro, the maid's kid.

41:37.686 --> 41:39.520
What is Mexican?
This is boy from house.

41:39.688 --> 41:41.606
That's Alejandro! That's Alejandro!

41:41.774 --> 41:43.191
- Wait.
- That's Alejandro!

41:43.359 --> 41:44.692
- Wait.
- Hi, Alejandro.

41:44.860 --> 41:47.695
You say it's not Jack's boy?

41:47.863 --> 41:50.448
Nikita, do you not understand
the English that we're speaking?

41:50.616 --> 41:52.659
This is the housekeeper's son.

41:52.826 --> 41:56.412
His mother is the housekeeper.
This is a Mexican person.

41:56.580 --> 41:58.623
We are Caucasian people, OK?

41:58.791 --> 42:00.541
You think Jack's gonna
give a shit about this?

42:00.709 --> 42:02.043
You know, he's gonna call the cops!

42:02.211 --> 42:05.546
Hey, is it a bag of hammers or a bag
of hair that you have for brains?

42:07.466 --> 42:09.050
It's a Mexican!

42:10.678 --> 42:12.470
It's a Mexican boy.

42:12.638 --> 42:16.349
- Shut up!
- We gotta get the fuck outta here.

42:16.517 --> 42:18.184
- Did you send them...
- No, I got a bad feeling.

42:18.352 --> 42:23.690
Sit the fuck down.

42:23.857 --> 42:25.316
You are not going anywhere.

42:25.484 --> 42:27.277
Where'd you find these people anyway?

42:29.363 --> 42:31.239
OK, OK, OK! OK, OK!

42:31.407 --> 42:34.075
I've done this before.

42:34.243 --> 42:38.037
I know this man. He will pay.

42:38.205 --> 42:41.124
- OK, OK.
- And if you fuck up...

42:43.085 --> 42:44.127
...I swear I'll kill you.

43:21.790 --> 43:23.291
You OK, Dad?

43:28.881 --> 43:30.173
Yeah.

43:32.676 --> 43:33.926
Come here.

43:48.400 --> 43:51.027
I need you to do something for me, OK?

43:55.491 --> 43:56.991
Sure.

44:00.079 --> 44:02.038
Keep an eye on Mom, all right?

44:02.206 --> 44:05.792
Got it? She loves you a lot.

44:09.671 --> 44:10.671
Yes, sir.

44:12.966 --> 44:14.092
OK.

44:16.136 --> 44:17.804
OK?

44:20.140 --> 44:21.974
Good boy.

44:26.188 --> 44:28.940
I'm gonna get him back, Diana.

45:46.477 --> 45:48.144
Why am I not surprised?

45:49.188 --> 45:51.272
Because, Jack, you're a very smart man.

45:51.440 --> 45:54.025
You've also always been
a very lucky man,

45:54.193 --> 45:57.445
but, alas, your luck seems
to have run out on you.

45:57.613 --> 45:59.697
I assume that's the money?

45:59.865 --> 46:01.491
Let's focus on why we're here.

46:01.658 --> 46:03.910
You're not gonna get shit from me
until I know the kid is safe.

46:04.077 --> 46:06.412
Jack, we're not animals here. Of course.

46:06.580 --> 46:07.830
And this'll make you happy.

46:07.998 --> 46:10.458
That money's not going to me,
it's going to him.

46:14.671 --> 46:16.964
Hey, buddy.

46:19.718 --> 46:23.221
You all right? You sure? OK.

46:25.307 --> 46:26.641
Let's go, all right?

46:31.230 --> 46:32.230
Can he go now?

46:33.815 --> 46:36.108
- Yeah, sure.
- Alejandro, just take a left.

46:36.276 --> 46:38.152
Go down the hall.

46:41.156 --> 46:42.782
Thank you for not hurting him.

46:46.328 --> 46:50.206
- Why did you kill Ivan?
- I didn't kill anybody.

46:50.374 --> 46:53.000
All right?
I promise, it was an accident.

46:53.168 --> 46:54.335
You can ask them. They were there.

46:54.503 --> 46:56.003
No, no, no.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

46:56.171 --> 46:57.922
We had nothing
to do with that, Nikita.

46:58.090 --> 47:00.424
- It was James, his bodyguard...
- He threatened my family.

47:00.592 --> 47:02.426
It wasn't supposed
to go down that way, Nikita.

47:02.594 --> 47:05.429
I know he was your nephew,
and this might not mean much,

47:05.597 --> 47:08.933
but, look, I'm very sorry...

47:09.101 --> 47:12.270
Easy there, we don't want him
signing contracts under duress.

47:13.522 --> 47:16.190
Jack, there's really no need
for long conversation here.

47:16.358 --> 47:19.694
I mean, you got the kid back, so why
don't you just sign these papers

47:19.861 --> 47:21.571
and we're through.

47:23.115 --> 47:24.615
What am I supposed to sign?

47:24.783 --> 47:26.617
Every line that's
got your name next to it.

47:26.785 --> 47:30.538
See, that'll certify that the
business now belongs to Nikita,

47:30.706 --> 47:32.290
myself and the boys.

47:33.208 --> 47:35.960
So with pen in hand,
would you like to write?

47:37.879 --> 47:39.547
Nice.

47:58.483 --> 48:00.568
Get out... now.

48:02.154 --> 48:05.323
What am I supposed to do?
I mean, I can't go back in time.

48:08.243 --> 48:10.244
Jerry?

48:12.331 --> 48:14.248
Can I backdate this to last year,

48:14.416 --> 48:18.669
so I don't get screwed paying a bunch
of taxes on money I don't even have?

48:18.837 --> 48:20.588
What did... what did you ask?

48:20.756 --> 48:22.590
May I backdate this?

48:28.972 --> 48:32.433
Yeah, sure. I don't see what
difference it fuckin' makes.

48:33.268 --> 48:35.394
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

48:45.947 --> 48:47.948
You know, Jack, this is great.

48:48.116 --> 48:52.286
I mean, straight up fuckin' great.

48:53.413 --> 48:54.622
I've been waitin'...

48:57.042 --> 48:58.918
A long time I've been waiting...

49:05.467 --> 49:09.387
You think you're
so fuckin' cute cutting me out.

49:10.138 --> 49:11.847
Well, now you got shit.

49:29.324 --> 49:32.576
A piece of shit like that
couldn't be trusted.

49:32.744 --> 49:34.662
No, no, no, no more killing.

49:34.830 --> 49:37.373
- Come on, respectfully, please...
- Sit down.

49:41.169 --> 49:46.215
One has to be careful
when he choose his partners...

49:47.592 --> 49:49.301
...Mr. Harris.

49:49.469 --> 49:52.680
You make good things for us
all these years.

49:52.848 --> 49:57.351
Sometimes business
is more important than family.

50:00.647 --> 50:02.189
Now, get out.

50:10.323 --> 50:11.574
Clean up that mess.

50:31.970 --> 50:33.929
So then Jack forced us to go
with him to dump the body.

50:34.097 --> 50:36.974
Yeah, then he said if we
told anybody, he'd kill us.

50:45.025 --> 50:46.567
Where did you dump the body?

50:48.069 --> 50:50.404
Told you before, in the ocean.

50:50.572 --> 50:53.240
Jack dumped the body in the ocean.
The ocean's the ocean.

50:53.408 --> 50:55.493
The ocean's the ocean, huh?

50:55.660 --> 50:56.911
Yeah, asshole.

51:00.040 --> 51:01.957
Alejandro!

51:10.926 --> 51:13.886
- Where the fuck is my lawyer?
- Let's focus on why we're here,

51:14.054 --> 51:16.472
'cause we're not here to talk about
dumped bodies and alleged murders.

51:16.640 --> 51:18.098
We're here to talk about
child pornography.

51:18.266 --> 51:20.267
Jack was just as much
a part of that as we were.

51:20.435 --> 51:22.186
- Just as much as you?
- Absolutely.

51:22.354 --> 51:24.063
He's OK.

51:26.608 --> 51:29.777
We have a contract that Jack signed
selling his shares of the company

51:29.945 --> 51:31.946
six months prior
to the Denny Z business,

51:32.113 --> 51:34.740
but it's nice to know there's no
dispute regarding your involvement.

51:34.908 --> 51:36.617
So thanks for that.

51:37.369 --> 51:39.829
Come on, let's get you inside.
