00:13.738 --> 00:15.980
It's too close for comfort.
I'm living right next door.

00:16.047 --> 00:18.868
It's, like, the fourth time
we've had fires in this block.

00:18.934 --> 00:22.105
But never this close.
This is ridiculous.

00:22.173 --> 00:26.438
You know, when I woke up,
I thought I was choking to death.

00:26.503 --> 00:28.165
- Excuse me.
- You been inside yet?

00:28.235 --> 00:30.607
- Just got here.
- Got a body in the basement, burned.

00:30.673 --> 00:32.400
You know who lives here?

00:32.469 --> 00:35.739
It's supposed to be vacant. At least
that's what the guy next door says.

00:35.805 --> 00:38.846
- That's him there. Name's, um, Paul Dunbar.
- This guy?

00:38.916 --> 00:41.890
Mr. Dunbar,
can we talk to you a second here?

00:41.963 --> 00:43.942
What went on here?

00:44.016 --> 00:47.187
I woke up smelling smoke, so I came outside.
It was coming out of the basement.

00:47.256 --> 00:49.815
They keep a window open a few inches
and smoke was coming out.

00:49.886 --> 00:52.127
- You know the owner?
- Yeah.

00:52.195 --> 00:55.049
She's been living in Queens with her son
about a year. Nobody lives here now.

00:55.114 --> 00:57.290
If there's a body in there,
I don't know whose it can be.

00:57.359 --> 00:59.918
Listen, did you notice any activity,
see anybody go in or out?

00:59.989 --> 01:03.794
Not a thing. Just Mrs. Krause's son
comes over every couple of months.

01:03.870 --> 01:06.527
- Can you give us his address?
- Yeah. I'll go get it.

01:06.597 --> 01:09.637
We're gonna go inside. Get the address.

01:13.236 --> 01:15.095
Oh, man.
It stinks of gasoline.

01:15.161 --> 01:17.621
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.
- How's it going, Vince?

01:17.694 --> 01:19.554
Holding my own.

01:19.619 --> 01:23.490
This woman got torched.

01:36.779 --> 01:38.441
Is that duct tape?

01:38.511 --> 01:41.168
Yeah. The eyes and the mouth.
Not tied up though.

01:41.237 --> 01:43.096
Not now anyway.

01:43.161 --> 01:47.000
There's no jewelry. We gotta get
the Crime Scene unit to bag her hands.

01:52.944 --> 01:56.565
I don't think her back is burned.

01:56.633 --> 01:58.677
Look at this.

01:58.749 --> 02:01.374
- What?
- Tattoo.

02:01.444 --> 02:03.171
- Where?
- Right here. A blue unicorn.

02:03.240 --> 02:04.902
Yeah, a unicorn means something.

02:04.972 --> 02:07.312
- What?
- Damned if I know.

02:07.378 --> 02:10.997
Vince, it means that we stand
half a chance of getting her identified.

02:11.066 --> 02:13.560
A decent arsonist
would turn his nose up at this one.

02:13.632 --> 02:16.901
He lights a fire and runs,
the fire sputters out on the concrete floor.

02:18.635 --> 02:21.774
You get amateurs
in every occupation, I guess.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.224
Hey, Greg?

03:37.480 --> 03:39.974
Yeah, uh, Narcotics
is running a wiretap.

03:40.046 --> 03:42.605
Picked up there's a contract
on Floyd Gates.

03:42.676 --> 03:45.048
- Good News Gates?
- Oh, the numbers guy.

03:45.113 --> 03:47.607
Yeah. Apparently there's a drug dealer
named Woodrow has a hit out on him.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.659
- Narcotics know what it's about?
- Not a clue.

03:49.732 --> 03:52.936
But you know the drill. Proceeds of a tap-
gotta warn Gates, offer him protection.

03:53.004 --> 03:55.114
Yeah. They got a detail
going on him?

03:55.185 --> 03:58.258
- There's a double shift in it, if you want.
- Sure, I'll do a double shift.

03:58.328 --> 04:00.887
But the cot in the upstairs dorm
is not exactly the Waldorf.

04:00.958 --> 04:02.850
No improvements
on that front, huh?

04:02.915 --> 04:04.774
Eh.

04:04.840 --> 04:09.455
I go back for a few days.
Tolerable intervals get shorter and shorter.

04:09.522 --> 04:11.469
Sorry to hear about that.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.435
Okay, here's where Gates lives.

04:13.500 --> 04:17.021
- I'll get up there right away. Thanks for the overtime, Lieu.
- Yeah.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.914
All right.
Thanks very much. Thanks.

04:19.978 --> 04:21.838
So, where are you on your D.O. A?

04:21.903 --> 04:23.762
I just talked to the woman
who owns the house.

04:23.828 --> 04:25.971
The place got burglarized
a few months ago.

04:26.041 --> 04:27.605
That could explain no forced entry.

04:27.677 --> 04:30.717
Maybe the burglar found a key
when he was in there before.

04:30.787 --> 04:32.996
And I also reached out
to the owner's son.

04:33.065 --> 04:35.689
He's on his way to work now,
but he'll call back.

04:35.759 --> 04:37.836
Excuse me, Andy.

04:37.909 --> 04:39.920
Missing Persons put me
with McNeil over at the 19th.

04:39.994 --> 04:43.580
He's working a 20-year-old white girl.
She's been missing for three days.

04:43.649 --> 04:47.269
I called over there andjust missed the
father. He's on the way to the apartment.

04:47.339 --> 04:50.762
He's got some handbills printed up with her
picture. He's canvassing the neighborhood.

04:50.834 --> 04:53.557
- Got an address on the daughter?
- We can catch him over there.

04:53.624 --> 04:56.730
Gentlemen, I spoke to my wife.

04:56.800 --> 05:01.350
A unicorn's a mythological creature with
the body parts of a bunch of different animals...

05:01.418 --> 05:03.179
'a lion's tail, so forth...

05:03.247 --> 05:04.941
and a big horn in
the middle of its head."

05:05.012 --> 05:08.248
- Good, Vince. Thanks.
- Yeah. That's all right, Bobby.

05:08.315 --> 05:10.556
Take care.

05:12.998 --> 05:16.782
So should we go see this guy
or follow up that mythological angle?

05:35.129 --> 05:37.371
- Hey. Greg Medavoy, 15 Squad.
- Yeah.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.265
Detective Elkins, 25 Squad.

05:42.539 --> 05:46.257
Taking a break.
They've been playing cards all night.

05:46.323 --> 05:50.741
That's Detective Grimes. He started the detail
with me. He's gonna do a double. Okay?

05:50.813 --> 05:54.138
- Yeah, okay.
- Here's Detective Greg Medavoy.

05:54.214 --> 05:56.105
He's gonna replace me.
Medavoy, this is Mr. Floyd Gates.

05:56.170 --> 05:58.029
- Good morning.
- Hey.

05:58.094 --> 06:01.200
Do you have any security devices
that I should familiarize myself with?

06:01.270 --> 06:03.643
Just a burglar alarm.
It's off.

06:03.708 --> 06:06.847
- If you want to, you can just call me Good News.
- Okay, Good News.

06:06.915 --> 06:10.305
- Shouldn't the alarm be on?
- We don't need no burglar alarm.

06:10.379 --> 06:12.457
We got you.

06:12.528 --> 06:14.638
Uh-oh.

06:18.911 --> 06:21.371
Who is it?

06:21.444 --> 06:23.008
- Louis!
- And Delmar!

06:23.081 --> 06:25.639
Let them in.

06:26.898 --> 06:29.938
Whoa! You're a white dude.
All right.

06:30.008 --> 06:33.476
- My brother, my brother!
- You still in one piece!

06:33.604 --> 06:35.911
- Hey, alive and kickin'.
- All right.

06:35.978 --> 06:38.854
- This is Greg. He's protection from the police department.
- How you doing, man?

06:38.928 --> 06:41.268
- Hi.
- Hey, I'm taking off.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.029
- It's all yours, Medavoy.
- Okay.

06:43.098 --> 06:45.373
- Thanks, Will. Come back and see me.
- Yeah.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.550
Take care of yourself.

06:47.621 --> 06:50.245
Let's get this game going before
you get your big ass shot full ofholes.

06:50.314 --> 06:53.136
Hey, man! Wake up!
Come on! Wake up, wake up! Get up!

06:53.201 --> 06:56.307
- Give him something to drink.
- Hey, Verdis, you want something, bro?

06:56.377 --> 06:58.838
- Yeah. Give me a shot of that.
- All right.

06:58.911 --> 07:01.503
Come on, Greg.
Get in the game. Get in the game.

07:01.573 --> 07:03.913
I think I better stick
to business, Mr. Gates.

07:03.979 --> 07:06.406
What do you think of that sucker
putting a contract out on Good News?

07:06.480 --> 07:09.783
Yeah. Wasn't that a hell of a thing?
Do you know what it was about?

07:09.848 --> 07:13.534
I don't know what it's about.
Good News, you know what it's about?

07:13.601 --> 07:16.674
That dope-dealing fool, Woodrow.
He got something against me.

07:16.745 --> 07:19.883
But the police are gonna protect my ass.
Right, Greg?

07:19.951 --> 07:23.090
- That borough gave you his name?
- Well, they had to tell me who to look out for.

07:24.314 --> 07:26.971
Come on, Greg.
Sit down and play a hand.

07:28.997 --> 07:32.038
- Well-
- Deal him in.

07:36.854 --> 07:39.578
Would you take one of these for me?
Thank you.

07:39.645 --> 07:43.910
Ma'am, would you take one of these?
Thank you very much.

07:46.541 --> 07:49.932
- Uh, do you know this girl?
- No.

07:50.006 --> 07:52.827
Would you take that with you?

07:52.892 --> 07:54.751
- Mr. Garabedian?
- Yeah?

07:54.817 --> 07:57.573
Detective Sipowicz, 15th Squad.
This is Detective Simone.

07:57.639 --> 07:59.881
What squad is that?
I've been talking with a Detective McNeil.

07:59.948 --> 08:03.021
Yeah. He gave us your name, sir.
We wanted to ask you a few questions.

08:03.091 --> 08:04.819
My daughter's missing.

08:04.888 --> 08:07.895
Does your daughter have any
distinguishing marks on her?

08:07.967 --> 08:10.909
Well, it says a scar on the back
ofher right calf.

08:10.983 --> 08:13.476
- A dog bit her when she was eight.
- How about a tattoo?

08:13.548 --> 08:15.692
- That kind of thing.
- No. No tattoo.

08:15.761 --> 08:18.582
- Why? Did you find a girl with a tattoo?
- Yeah.

08:18.648 --> 08:20.857
- Uh-huh.
- What was her condition?

08:20.925 --> 08:24.348
We found a body in a fire.
She was in her early 20s.

08:24.421 --> 08:28.172
She had a small tattoo of a unicorn
on the back ofher right shoulder.

08:28.238 --> 08:30.578
- No. That wouldn't be Angie.
- Who's that kid?

08:30.644 --> 08:32.404
- Thank you.
- Uh, he's helping me.

08:32.472 --> 08:35.861
Him and his wife were staying
with my daughter the last week.

08:35.936 --> 08:38.308
- They students? Working people?
- His wife, Lisa, has a job.

08:38.374 --> 08:41.611
Johnny, he stays home with the baby.
Lisa grew up with Angie.

08:41.677 --> 08:45.330
They were getting some repairs done on
their apartment. Angie let them stay with her.

08:45.398 --> 08:47.290
Excuse me.

08:47.354 --> 08:50.460
- Can I see one of those?
- Yeah. Here's one in color.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.537
Mr. Garabedian, you'd know if your daughter
had a tattoo, right?

08:53.609 --> 08:55.206
Absolutely.
Yes.

08:56.367 --> 08:58.160
Your nameJohnny?

08:58.228 --> 09:00.601
Yes.
Johnny Arcotti.

09:00.666 --> 09:04.319
My name's Simone. So you're helping out
Mr. Garabedian here, huh?

09:04.386 --> 09:06.278
Yeah. Angie's been missing
for three days now.

09:06.342 --> 09:09.546
We're getting kind of worried about her.
My wife and her, they grew up together.

09:09.615 --> 09:13.420
I'm wondering, do you know
if Angie had any sort of markings on her?

09:13.495 --> 09:17.279
Her dad said she didn't,
but sometimes a father might not know.

09:17.344 --> 09:20.220
- Like a tattoo or something like that?
- Yeah, exactly.

09:20.295 --> 09:23.302
Yeah, she had a tattoo.
It was of a unicorn.

09:23.374 --> 09:25.167
She did, huh?
Andy.

09:25.234 --> 09:28.406
Yeah. You see Legend?
You know, the movie with Tom Cruise?

09:28.474 --> 09:30.551
- No. Where's this tattoo?
- It was on her shoulder.

09:30.623 --> 09:33.182
We need to talk to
Mr. Garabedian some more.

09:33.253 --> 09:35.298
But I want to talk
to you some more too.

09:35.370 --> 09:38.224
It's his daughter.
He's just pegged the tattoo.

09:38.289 --> 09:40.399
Son of a bitch.

09:40.470 --> 09:42.263
Thank you very much.

09:48.457 --> 09:51.180
Mr. Garabedian, uh...

09:51.247 --> 09:54.550
there's a chance your daughter's involved
in this case we're working on.

09:54.615 --> 09:56.474
What makes you say that?

09:56.539 --> 09:59.612
Is there any way that we can possibly access
your daughter's dental records?

09:59.682 --> 10:01.826
Why would you need them?

10:01.896 --> 10:04.488
To see if there's discrepancies with regards
to the case that we're working on now.

10:04.558 --> 10:07.861
- You know, just to stay on the safe side.
- L- I don't understand.

10:07.925 --> 10:12.923
- What's the point if she didn't have that tattoo?
- Johnny seems to think she did.

10:12.993 --> 10:15.071
No. No. I was close
with my daughter.

10:15.143 --> 10:18.117
No, Mr. Garabedian.
She did have a tattoo. It was of a unicorn.

10:18.190 --> 10:20.683
It was on her shoulder.

10:20.756 --> 10:22.669
Oh, my God.

10:22.744 --> 10:25.948
All right, well,
we'll take it one step at a time.

10:26.016 --> 10:28.323
We'll look for dental records.

10:28.389 --> 10:31.178
Uh, our lawyer's Gerald Fleishmann.

10:31.244 --> 10:34.448
Sir, her dentist?

10:34.515 --> 10:39.032
Right, dentist. Columbus Avenue.
He would have her records.

10:39.102 --> 10:42.241
- There still could be some discrepancy.
- Absolutely. Absolutely.

10:42.310 --> 10:44.804
Just, let's take it one step at a time.

10:44.876 --> 10:46.790
Right.

10:56.134 --> 10:57.993
- Lieu?
- Yeah?

10:58.059 --> 11:00.880
That girl missing in the 19th?
That's gonna be our D.O.A.

11:00.945 --> 11:03.767
- Can we make an I. D?
- Her father just got us her dental records.

11:03.832 --> 11:06.139
- Andy's running them over to the morgue.
- The father got any ideas?

11:06.206 --> 11:09.530
This guy wasn't ready for that kind of
conversation. He had been up for two days.

11:09.606 --> 11:11.716
Just about hysterical
fighting off that it could be her.

11:11.786 --> 11:13.415
He's waiting to hear at home.

11:13.486 --> 11:15.465
Who's that?

11:15.539 --> 11:18.895
A friend of the family. Him and his wife
were staying at the D.O.A.'s apartment.

11:18.971 --> 11:22.012
- Why's that?
- They were getting their place fixed up.

11:26.797 --> 11:28.656
- James?
- Yeah.

11:28.721 --> 11:31.543
Could you do me a favor?
Run this guy, Johnny, through B.C.I. For me.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.522
- Okay, no problem.
- Thanks.

11:36.323 --> 11:40.971
- I'm not gonna swear by that.
- That's all right. Just as long as it's got caffeine in it.

11:41.038 --> 11:44.045
Couple hours into the shift,
you know, it starts getting a little ripe.

11:45.432 --> 11:47.291
Yeah- I'm just trying to think.

11:47.357 --> 11:49.631
I mean, who could've
done this to her?

11:49.698 --> 11:52.705
You figure this girl we found
could be Angie, huh?

11:52.777 --> 11:55.369
Well, yeah, definitely,
by what you said- the, uh, tattoo.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.934
Yeah.
I think you're probably right.

12:00.187 --> 12:03.840
There was this Russian guy-Angie went
to Virginia with him a couple weeks ago.

12:03.907 --> 12:06.247
He was giving her a pretty hard time.

12:06.313 --> 12:09.134
I remember Angie called up Lisa
and said the guy was pushing on her.

12:09.200 --> 12:12.983
- She say what it was about?
- I think sex. 'Cause she wasn't sleeping with him on the trip.

12:13.049 --> 12:15.738
- Well, do you know if he put hands on her at all?
- No, I don't...

12:15.807 --> 12:18.683
I mean, I don't know. I mean, I do know
that they did come back a day early, though.

12:18.758 --> 12:20.452
Huh.

12:20.522 --> 12:23.343
Then, like, a week ago
this guy, uh, Dimitri, he came over.

12:23.408 --> 12:26.350
He was really drunk,
and Angie started to freak out.

12:26.424 --> 12:29.814
He took his shirt off- the guy got her name
and a unicorn tattooed on his arm.

12:29.887 --> 12:31.680
So what happened
when Angie freaked out?

12:31.748 --> 12:34.822
Yeah, well, you know,
we drank a few beers, and...

12:34.892 --> 12:38.195
- And she did finally tell him to leave.
- Anyone doing drugs?

12:38.259 --> 12:40.085
Nah.

12:40.152 --> 12:42.011
Come on, John.

12:42.076 --> 12:45.565
I'm working a homicide here. No one's
gonna get hassled for their party habits.

12:45.636 --> 12:49.442
I'm just looking to get a clear picture
of this, uh- Dimitri, right?

12:49.517 --> 12:53.586
No, I understand. I'm just- Okay, I wouldn't
be surprised if the guy smoked some pot.

12:53.655 --> 12:55.962
But he just didn't do it in front of me.

12:56.028 --> 12:59.648
So- So you're thinking then that this guy,
he could've harmed Angie, huh?

12:59.717 --> 13:03.238
Oh, yeah. No, definitely. I mean, this guy-
I mean, he was definitely a strange guy.

13:03.309 --> 13:05.452
You know where
we could find this guy?

13:05.523 --> 13:07.567
You could check her address book.

13:08.826 --> 13:10.685
Dimitri.

13:10.750 --> 13:13.342
- Dimitri, uh-
- Any idea of the last name?

13:13.413 --> 13:16.387
Yeah. Golf. Golf.
Something like that.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.505
I think it's G-0-L-0...

13:19.571 --> 13:21.331
F- F.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.177
Two F's. Thanks.

13:26.243 --> 13:31.405
Yeah, Johnny, I was holding off talking to
Mr. Garabedian until we were sure about Angie.

13:31.470 --> 13:33.362
But I really appreciate your help.

13:33.427 --> 13:36.468
Yeah. So, did you guys find anything out
that could help you at the scene?

13:36.538 --> 13:38.845
- I'm not supposed to say, John.
- Yeah.

13:38.912 --> 13:42.849
But, you know, between me and you,
you've been real helpful here.

13:42.921 --> 13:45.830
There were some fingerprints
that we lifted from the crime scene.

13:45.904 --> 13:47.763
- That's good, right?
- Yeah.

13:47.828 --> 13:50.256
- That's in confidence.
- Yeah. No, I understand.

13:50.331 --> 13:52.670
Okay.
Thanks for the information.

13:52.736 --> 13:55.229
You ever been in trouble yourself?

13:55.302 --> 13:57.446
- No.
- I wouldn't think so.

13:57.515 --> 14:01.036
- And when she gets a chance, we can talk to your wife?
- Is it Lisa?

14:01.107 --> 14:03.316
Yeah, Lisa.
She's working now.

14:03.385 --> 14:05.659
Uh, Johnny,
who's taking care of your baby?

14:05.726 --> 14:08.121
She took it to work.
I was handing out the leaflets.

14:08.196 --> 14:10.306
Uh-huh. All right.
Take care.

14:10.377 --> 14:12.006
All right.

14:13.713 --> 14:16.949
OurJohnny took collars for grand larceny auto
and soliciting for a minor.

14:17.016 --> 14:19.925
Pimped a 15-year-old girl.

14:19.999 --> 14:23.422
How's it going?
Those records match?

14:23.495 --> 14:26.634
It was her.
These assholes.

14:26.703 --> 14:30.159
She had carbon in her lungs.
I gotta call the girl's father.

14:30.231 --> 14:33.052
- She was alive when they set her on fire.
- Mm-hmm.

14:33.118 --> 14:35.994
Oh, we gotta look at a Dimitri Goloff.

14:41.842 --> 14:43.854
Uh, Mr. Garabedian?

14:43.927 --> 14:45.874
This is Detective Sipowicz.

14:48.962 --> 14:50.822
Deal a brother a hand, man.

14:50.887 --> 14:53.227
Come on, Gregory.
Give us some cards here.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.819
Do not fool around.

14:55.890 --> 14:58.099
- We are card players here.
- Right.

14:58.168 --> 15:01.951
Hey, Greg, how long you figure the department
will be willing to protect me like this?

15:02.017 --> 15:04.029
Ah, as long as it takes, I guess.

15:04.102 --> 15:07.207
This could be a very long card game.

15:07.278 --> 15:09.804
Pretty soon we gonna need
some women up in here.

15:09.875 --> 15:12.302
- Yeah! I can dig that.
- Get one for Greg too.

15:12.377 --> 15:14.389
- Right!
- What kind you like, Greg?

15:14.462 --> 15:17.284
You like 'em with a little meat on the bones?
A little thunder in the thighs?

15:17.349 --> 15:20.006
- How about-
- Wandell!

15:20.075 --> 15:22.054
- Wandell! -
Yeah! Yeah! - Ooh!

15:24.405 --> 15:27.893
- How about it, Greg? Want me to give her a call?
- No, let's leave that alone.

15:27.965 --> 15:30.622
You don't want no woman, man?

15:30.691 --> 15:32.102
Hey, guys, I'm on duty.

15:32.167 --> 15:35.108
- Oooh! He on duty.
- Yeah. What's wrong with you, Louis?

15:35.182 --> 15:38.769
The man's on duty. He's protecting my ass.
He ain't got time for no women.

15:38.838 --> 15:41.692
- Ain't that right, Greg?
- Yeah.

15:41.758 --> 15:44.415
- Or do you want to get you a little?
- I'm working!

15:44.484 --> 15:47.305
- Well, have a drink with us.
- Nah, I can't drink either.

15:47.370 --> 15:50.126
- But I am having a good time.
- All right!

15:54.555 --> 15:56.469
Have a seat right there, Dimitri.

16:02.766 --> 16:04.559
- Lieu?
- Yeah?

16:04.626 --> 16:08.147
That's the Russian. He was warming
a bar stool across the street from his building.

16:08.219 --> 16:10.395
D.O.A.'s father's on his way in.

16:10.464 --> 16:13.220
And that kid you told we had prints?

16:13.286 --> 16:15.561
I figured if he was wrong, it would
give him something to think about.

16:15.628 --> 16:18.384
- His wife's coming in at 5:30.
- We got a subpoena to dump the girl's phone?

16:18.450 --> 16:20.309
Yeah. Russell's
at Telephone Security.

16:20.375 --> 16:22.387
- Okay, cool. Thanks, Lieu.
- Okay.

16:26.340 --> 16:28.867
You wanna sit down?

16:30.479 --> 16:33.300
How many drinks
you had today, Dimitri?

16:33.365 --> 16:35.377
Two vodkas.

16:35.450 --> 16:37.364
- So you're more or less sober, right?
- Yeah.

16:37.438 --> 16:41.539
All right, I want you to remember
when you saw Angie Garabedian last.

16:41.608 --> 16:44.550
- What about Angie?
- Did you hear what he said? When did you see her last?

16:44.623 --> 16:47.630
What I am here for about Angie?
She put a complaint?

16:47.703 --> 16:50.809
That's not how it goes-
we ask a question, you ask a question.

16:50.878 --> 16:53.305
When did you see this girl?

16:53.379 --> 16:57.065
Maybe three or four nights ago.
I see her at this club, Snakes.

16:57.132 --> 16:59.406
- Did you talk to her?
- Just hello." She don't want to talk to me.

16:59.474 --> 17:01.584
- Who was she with?
- A girlfriend.

17:01.655 --> 17:04.476
- Where did you go after you left the club?
- Home. Went to bed.

17:04.540 --> 17:07.810
We heard about this trip you took to Virginia
with Angie. You two sleeping together?

17:07.877 --> 17:09.736
What do you want?
Who is making this complaint?

17:09.801 --> 17:13.070
- You see? That's you asking us again.
- Were you sleeping with Angie?

17:13.137 --> 17:15.116
Couple times.

17:15.190 --> 17:18.231
We heard that
she wouldn't sleep with you.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.963
Who is complaining on me?

17:20.032 --> 17:22.974
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

17:23.049 --> 17:25.224
Take it off.
Come on. The shirt.

17:31.901 --> 17:33.913
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

17:35.494 --> 17:38.445
- See, I think that you were very serious about her.
- I got drunk.

17:39.665 --> 17:41.525
Angie's in the morgue, Dimitri.

17:41.590 --> 17:43.449
We found her body this morning.

17:43.514 --> 17:45.374
She was murdered.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.298
Are you telling the truth?

17:47.363 --> 17:50.950
If you killed her,
you'll feel better, you let it go.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.346
What?

18:10.585 --> 18:12.925
No, I...

18:12.991 --> 18:15.167
I couldn't hurt Angie.

18:15.235 --> 18:17.510
Maybe she did something
to hurt your feelings.

18:17.577 --> 18:20.398
- Then something happened that you didn't mean to happen.
- No!

18:20.464 --> 18:23.504
You didn't get mad
because you couldn't have her?

18:23.576 --> 18:26.200
No. I wasn't good enough
to have her.

18:28.771 --> 18:31.078
I don't have no class.

18:33.165 --> 18:36.883
- Bobby, you got a second?
- Yeah.

18:36.951 --> 18:40.024
- What's up?
- Alex Sandoval just got shot on Fourth.

18:40.094 --> 18:42.139
He could be connected
with this John Arcotti.

18:42.211 --> 18:44.070
On Johnny's pop for that G.L. A...

18:44.135 --> 18:46.213
Sandoval took the collar with him.

18:48.625 --> 18:51.184
Put your shirt back on.

18:58.183 --> 19:00.458
Excuse me.

19:01.776 --> 19:03.503
- You got any witnesses?
- Over there.

19:03.572 --> 19:05.716
- She see it?
- She was with him.

19:05.785 --> 19:09.405
- Keep this area
clear for emergency vehicles.

19:09.473 --> 19:12.229
- Shot from behind.
- Yep.

19:12.297 --> 19:16.299
So either this is a coincidence,
orJohnny and Alex are back in business.

19:16.370 --> 19:19.606
John gets worried about those fingerprints
we didn't find- He goes out and whacks Alex.

19:19.674 --> 19:21.587
Let's go talk to her.

19:24.068 --> 19:26.014
- Baby get hurt?
- Baby's okay.

19:26.088 --> 19:28.330
That's the father's blood on the kid.

19:28.398 --> 19:30.257
What's your name?

19:30.323 --> 19:32.182
It's Donna Mendoza.

19:32.247 --> 19:34.139
Did you see who shot him, Donna?

19:34.203 --> 19:36.762
No. No.
Alex was holding the baby.

19:36.833 --> 19:40.037
Then he fell down on the baby,
and I had to get him off the baby.

19:40.105 --> 19:42.533
- You didn't get any kind of look at this guy?
- I don't- I don't know.

19:42.607 --> 19:45.264
Look, I'm sorry, Donna.
I do have to ask you some questions.

19:45.333 --> 19:47.673
- Is the baby all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

19:47.739 --> 19:50.079
- Do you know a John Arcotti?
- No.

19:50.144 --> 19:53.468
- Maybe one of Alex's friends?
- He don't- He don't bring his friends around.

19:53.544 --> 19:57.000
If this wasn't an accident, can you think of any
reason why somebody would want to do this?

19:57.073 --> 20:00.726
He came right up behind us
and shot Alex in the head.

20:02.878 --> 20:05.022
I had to get him off the baby.

20:05.091 --> 20:08.995
All right, don't look over there.
Just go inside. Baby's cold.

20:34.118 --> 20:36.808
So, what is it? Romance?

20:36.877 --> 20:38.736
Maybe he was bangin' her.

20:38.802 --> 20:41.174
Plus these others.
Look at this phone list.

20:41.239 --> 20:43.448
Now Angie gets a conscience pang...

20:43.516 --> 20:45.758
or they beef, her and Johnny...

20:45.826 --> 20:48.800
and she's gonna blow the whistle
toJohnny's wife.

20:48.873 --> 20:51.147
ExceptJohnny
decides to kill her instead.

20:51.214 --> 20:54.800
- Alex carries the kerosene for old time's sake.
- Or maybe 20 bucks.

20:54.870 --> 20:58.392
And Johnny decides to whack Alex
'cause he could be a witness.

21:02.088 --> 21:04.198
- How's it going?
- Hey, John.

21:04.269 --> 21:07.276
Lisa brought the baby to me before she
came to talk to you, so I figured I'd come in.

21:07.348 --> 21:09.720
Yeah, sure.

21:09.786 --> 21:11.677
- Andy, you want to talk to Mrs. Arcotti?
- Yeah.

21:13.795 --> 21:16.736
- Come on. We can talk down here.
- All right.

21:16.810 --> 21:19.850
John, stay with me.
I'll fill you in on what's going on.

21:21.172 --> 21:23.348
That's okay.
Go ahead, honey.

21:23.417 --> 21:25.112
Want something to drink?

21:25.181 --> 21:27.937
- Uh, yeah. You got Coke?
- Both kinds.

21:28.004 --> 21:29.950
What's the baby's name?

21:30.024 --> 21:32.134
It's Oliver.
It's named after Lisa's grandfather.

21:32.205 --> 21:35.409
Yeah.
So how's it going with the case?

21:35.477 --> 21:37.718
- Hey, just pluggin' away, man.
- Pluggin'away, huh?

21:37.786 --> 21:39.700
No, uh-
No big developments?

21:39.775 --> 21:43.876
You know, now that you're in, John, there is
one discrepancy that I wanted to ask you on...

21:43.944 --> 21:45.836
where we learned
you do have a record.

21:47.826 --> 21:50.800
Yeah, I thought about that afterwards.
But I wasn't sure what you meant by that.

21:50.872 --> 21:54.459
Well, you were collared for a G.L.A.,
and you pimped a child prostitute.

21:54.529 --> 21:57.952
I misunderstood, when the area of the crime
that you were looking at...

21:58.025 --> 22:00.901
Mm-hmm. Which would be
an abduction-murder.

22:00.976 --> 22:03.371
Yeah.

22:03.446 --> 22:05.458
Okay, jackpot on the car.
That was a registration mix-up.

22:05.531 --> 22:08.090
And the girl, I mean,
there was no way I was pimpin' her.

22:08.161 --> 22:11.168
To look at her, you'd think she was 20.
She had tits out to here.

22:11.240 --> 22:14.061
- That must've been a shock.
- Yeah. I thought she was my girlfriend.

22:14.126 --> 22:16.948
Turns out she's balling anything with
a pair of pants and I'm the last to find out.

22:17.013 --> 22:20.250
And that vice cop in court,
he stands up and says I was soliciting him.

22:20.317 --> 22:23.488
- I'd never seen him in my life.
- Wow.

22:25.481 --> 22:27.591
- What about Dimitri?
- Oh, we talked to him, John.

22:27.662 --> 22:30.965
- I don't think that's going anywhere.
- No, huh?

22:31.030 --> 22:33.622
I'd forget about Dimitri.

22:33.692 --> 22:35.606
It wasn't him.

22:35.681 --> 22:40.296
There are three calls here from your phone
toJohnny's beeper that night.

22:40.363 --> 22:45.328
You're telling meJohnny's sitting there
next to you, so you dialed him on his beeper?

22:45.400 --> 22:48.188
Look, Johnny was home all night.
That's gotta be a mistake.

22:48.254 --> 22:50.528
So, how about these mistakes, Lisa? Here.

22:50.595 --> 22:55.046
You got dozens of calls
to a Carla Leon and a Helen Slauson...

22:55.118 --> 22:58.771
all from Angie's apartment,
all while you and Angie were working.

22:58.838 --> 23:01.364
Now, do you know
these women, huh?

23:01.437 --> 23:04.258
Were these mutual friends
with you and Johnny?

23:04.323 --> 23:07.910
Carla's someoneJohnny had a thing with
after we first got together, but he broke it off.

23:07.980 --> 23:10.572
Oh. So he was just calling
to remind her it was over.

23:11.989 --> 23:13.848
How about Helen Slauson?
Who's she?

23:13.914 --> 23:15.740
I don't know who that is.

23:15.806 --> 23:18.682
The truth is, Johnny's running
from one bed to another...

23:18.757 --> 23:21.633
while you're out working,
supporting him, Lisa.

23:21.708 --> 23:24.015
He was home all that night!

23:25.300 --> 23:27.312
- You know he's got a record?
- No.

23:27.385 --> 23:29.977
Johnny was a pimp and a car thief.

23:30.047 --> 23:34.979
As a matter of fact, one of the guys
he used to steal cars with got murdered today.

23:35.050 --> 23:37.095
You know an Alex Sandoval?

23:38.066 --> 23:39.925
Look, I don't know any Alex.

23:39.990 --> 23:41.849
And Johnny didn't go out that night.

23:41.915 --> 23:44.255
All right, so it was a coincidence...

23:44.320 --> 23:48.158
you and Johnny being houseguests just
when Angie got kidnapped and murdered, huh?

23:48.233 --> 23:51.109
I gotta get back to my baby.

23:56.444 --> 23:58.456
- Who is it?
- It's Bob.

23:58.529 --> 24:01.318
- Bob.
- Let him in.

24:01.383 --> 24:03.363
- Boxing.
- Boxing?

24:03.437 --> 24:06.706
Man, you will lose your ass
messing around with boxing.

24:06.772 --> 24:09.047
Not on this deal.
It's the fight of the century.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.541
And ain't nobody
thought of it but me.

24:11.615 --> 24:14.240
- Yeah, right.
- Who's the fighters?

24:14.310 --> 24:17.481
- I tell you, we split 50/50.
- Okay. We partners.

24:17.549 --> 24:20.371
Okay. It's Mike Tyson and O.J. Simpson.

24:20.436 --> 24:22.196
Get outta here!

24:22.264 --> 24:25.086
Hey, what are you laughing at?
We getJudge Ito to referee.

24:25.151 --> 24:28.902
You getJudge Ito, I'll put it on.

24:30.219 --> 24:33.073
How is it out there, Bob?
Anybody take a potshot at you?

24:33.137 --> 24:35.663
- No.
- Everything quiet out there?

24:35.736 --> 24:37.332
It's quiet now.

24:39.873 --> 24:42.180
- All right. Whose bet is it?
- It's yours, man.

24:42.247 --> 24:45.003
- I wish you'd bet.
- Shut up!

24:45.070 --> 24:48.394
Man, hold it!
I call, and I raise.

24:51.613 --> 24:54.402
I am not gonna hear talk like this.
My daughter is not a tramp.

24:54.467 --> 24:56.807
No one is saying anything
like that, Mr. Garabedian.

24:56.873 --> 24:59.694
We just want your impression of the relationship
between your daughter and John Arcotti.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.553
Lisa was my daughter's best friend.

25:01.620 --> 25:03.992
She's not gonna sleep with
her best friend's husband!

25:04.058 --> 25:09.023
With Johnny's background and his access
to your daughter, we gotta treat him as a suspect.

25:09.093 --> 25:13.675
Your daughter never mentioned he made her feel
uncomfortable? Maybe he'd made some advances?

25:13.744 --> 25:16.566
No. She liked him!
I was happy when they moved in.

25:16.631 --> 25:20.087
Look, I'd worried about
my daughter living alone.

25:20.159 --> 25:22.980
When she came to me
about Lisa and John, it was a relief.

25:23.046 --> 25:25.637
I'd hoped that after they'd left,
she'd want a full-time roommate.

25:25.707 --> 25:28.529
- She asked for your permission for them to move in?
- I pay the rent.

25:28.594 --> 25:31.951
I will not- not have
these people called murderers!

25:32.027 --> 25:34.684
I gave them permission to be there!

25:35.715 --> 25:38.022
Bobby.

25:41.168 --> 25:43.147
Thanks very much, Mr. Garabedian.

25:43.221 --> 25:47.508
Uh, John said you thought a Russian
might be a suspect.

25:47.582 --> 25:49.441
Well, we're still fitting things together.

25:49.507 --> 25:52.328
Listen, thank you very much
for your cooperation.

25:52.393 --> 25:57.041
Detective, I know I didn't know
about the tattoo.

25:57.108 --> 26:00.149
But I know my daughter
was a good girl.

26:01.471 --> 26:04.642
She would never hurt Lisa that way.

26:04.710 --> 26:06.722
Okay, Mr. Garabedian.

26:12.537 --> 26:14.199
- Hey.
- This is Carla Leon.

26:14.269 --> 26:16.281
Looks like she took a beating.

26:16.353 --> 26:18.693
How'd you do on the other one?
Helen Slauson?

26:18.759 --> 26:21.099
We got one other place to look.

26:22.448 --> 26:24.012
Who hit you, Carla?

26:27.419 --> 26:29.726
You don't know who hit you?

26:29.793 --> 26:32.866
- What you call me in here for?
- You know a John Arcotti?

26:35.438 --> 26:37.899
Come on, Carla.
Sit down. Come on.

26:39.672 --> 26:43.127
Now, this John,
made a whole lot of phone calls to you...

26:43.200 --> 26:48.066
from this girl's apartment who was
found tied and burned in a vacant house.

26:48.140 --> 26:51.311
- I don't know about it.
- You don't know about him making phone calls to you?

26:51.379 --> 26:55.283
You must be in deep, Carla. That lie
just made you an accessory to murder.

26:55.356 --> 26:58.112
- So you must've done something worse than that.
- That's right.

26:58.179 --> 27:01.503
- Were you at the scene? 'Cause, see, that surprises me.
- I don't know anything!

27:01.578 --> 27:05.581
I tell you that, you say
it makes me a convict?

27:05.652 --> 27:07.544
Johnny must have you
pretty afraid, doesn't he?

27:07.608 --> 27:09.270
You could say that.

27:09.340 --> 27:11.484
Let's just start with you seeing him.

27:11.553 --> 27:13.412
I've been dating Johnny somewhat.

27:13.478 --> 27:15.337
He seeing anybody else?

27:15.402 --> 27:17.316
I know he got other girlfriend.

27:17.391 --> 27:19.786
- Do you know her name?
- Lisa.

27:19.861 --> 27:21.490
Yeah.
Well, Carla, that's his wife.

27:23.389 --> 27:25.916
You ever hear of a girl named Angie?

27:27.431 --> 27:30.787
Yeah. The girl they moved in
with until their apartment's fixed.

27:30.862 --> 27:33.487
Sometimes Johnny starts saying he's gonna
make a lot of money. It's involved with her.

27:33.557 --> 27:36.378
Her father got a lot of money,
and so forth.

27:36.444 --> 27:39.867
Me, I just figured he's gonna putJohnny
in business or somethin'.

27:39.940 --> 27:42.401
Angie's father's
gonna putJohnny in business?

27:42.474 --> 27:46.826
Was he gonna put Alex Sandoval
in business?

27:46.899 --> 27:49.775
'Cause you know Alex too.
Right, Carla?

27:49.850 --> 27:52.190
He used to come up.
They talked.

27:52.256 --> 27:54.629
- Johnny and Alex'd come to your place?
- Yeah.

27:54.694 --> 27:57.516
I never paid attention to what they were saying.
I couldn't follow it anyway.

27:57.581 --> 27:59.725
It was like some kind of
code or something.

27:59.794 --> 28:01.653
Man, I just liked Johnny.

28:01.718 --> 28:05.272
And today I get a call from Don Brunelli,
another guy that come up.

28:05.342 --> 28:07.201
He said Alex is dead.

28:07.267 --> 28:10.570
Alex got shot, like, he got his head
blown off in the street.

28:10.635 --> 28:13.062
I already seen on the TV
that that girl died.

28:13.136 --> 28:14.995
And Johnny comes over half crazy.

28:15.061 --> 28:17.270
I asked what happened,
and he says...

28:17.338 --> 28:20.159
Shut your mouth, bitch!
Shut the hell up!"

28:20.225 --> 28:22.237
Then he hits me.

28:22.310 --> 28:25.131
Smashes me in the face.

28:25.196 --> 28:28.018
I locked myself in the bathroom.
He kicks the door open.

28:28.083 --> 28:30.904
I'm, like, What are you
gettin' mad at me for?"

28:30.970 --> 28:34.206
He says he'd better be able to trust me.

28:34.274 --> 28:36.351
What's he gotta trust you about?

28:36.423 --> 28:40.393
Look, all I heard him say was the phone
didn't work. The call must not have worked.

28:40.464 --> 28:44.150
- Who were they calling?
- The girl's father, I guess, to get the money.

28:44.217 --> 28:46.644
They kidnapped that girl for ransom?

28:46.718 --> 28:48.216
I guess so.

28:48.290 --> 28:52.708
He said when they made the call,
it must not have gone through.

28:52.781 --> 28:56.172
Look, man, I don't know what he did,
but I'm scared of him.

28:56.245 --> 28:59.153
- You know where this Don Brunelli lives?
- No.

28:59.227 --> 29:02.431
This guy's number's on the phone dump
from Angie's apartment.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.512
Listen, don't go home, Carla.

29:04.585 --> 29:07.493
- You got someplace else to go?
- Yeah. My parents live in Jersey.

29:07.567 --> 29:10.291
- Does Johnny know where?
- No.

29:10.358 --> 29:12.370
All right.
Go stay with them.

29:13.437 --> 29:15.777
Give us the number.

29:15.842 --> 29:17.919
Man, I'm so scared.

29:31.398 --> 29:35.336
Yeah, I can understand
your impatience, but, uh...

29:35.408 --> 29:37.201
Hey, fellas.
Wait right there.

29:37.268 --> 29:40.089
You'll have to bear with me a moment,
Mr. Garabedian. All hell's breaking loose today.

29:40.155 --> 29:42.976
I've got an urgent phone call
for one of my detectives...

29:43.041 --> 29:45.731
and I've gotta go through
the 61's with his partner.

29:45.800 --> 29:49.671
If you'll give me just two minutes,
I'll be right back. Please have a seat.

29:49.745 --> 29:51.505
That's the lieutenant.

29:51.574 --> 29:54.810
Hey, Andy.
This call just came in for you.

29:54.877 --> 29:58.015
You gotta get back to him.
I've gotta go through your 61 's.

29:58.084 --> 30:00.676
Sarge, can I get those 61's, please?

30:00.747 --> 30:02.606
There's no number here.

30:02.672 --> 30:04.913
- Um, yeah. Call the weather.
- What's all this about, Lieu?

30:04.981 --> 30:08.502
The victim's father came back with a lawyer
to look out for his daughter's interests.

30:08.573 --> 30:11.066
Meanwhile, John Arcotti's
waiting upstairs to talk to you.

30:11.138 --> 30:12.768
- Now?
- Yeah, yeah. He's pretty wired.

30:12.839 --> 30:15.660
I don't want that father
taking this guy up there.

30:15.726 --> 30:18.547
- They may lawyer the kid up, and then we're dead.
- That's right.

30:18.612 --> 30:20.504
- Any good on the third guy?
- Brunelli?

30:20.569 --> 30:22.876
It's in the wind.
He cleaned out the apartment.

30:22.942 --> 30:27.108
Uh, yeah, Sylvia, it's me. Listen, don't say
anything. I might talk. I might not.

30:27.176 --> 30:29.188
Check this out, Lieu.

30:29.261 --> 30:31.438
The landlord says that this guy,
Brunelli, he's 6 foot 3.

30:31.506 --> 30:34.579
The average height description we got
from the witnesses on the Sandoval homicide...

30:34.649 --> 30:37.471
I mean, that's gotta beJohn Arcotti
and not this guy Brunelli.

30:37.536 --> 30:41.156
- Hold on. I'm still here.
- Yeah, and B," Brunelli bags his trash.

30:41.224 --> 30:43.914
He's got a $17 receipt in there
from a Payless station.

30:43.983 --> 30:46.444
Five bucks' worth of gas,
$12 for the can.

30:46.517 --> 30:48.310
You figure he set the fire?

30:48.377 --> 30:50.936
I'm saying good-bye now.
I'll call back when I understand.

30:51.007 --> 30:53.249
Station attendant I.D.'s
all three of the guys...

30:53.317 --> 30:56.456
off the tape from the video camera-
Johnny, Sandoval and Brunelli.

30:56.524 --> 30:58.383
All three of them bought the gas.

30:58.448 --> 31:00.493
You tell me,
what kind of crooks are these?

31:00.565 --> 31:03.321
They snatch up a girl for ransom
and never get through on the ransom call.

31:03.388 --> 31:06.812
Buying the gas isn't gonna give us a conviction
and doesn't put them at the house.

31:06.885 --> 31:10.089
- Let me work on this guyJohn.
- All right. I got the father.

31:11.535 --> 31:14.127
- How are you, Mr. Garabedian?
- Detective.

31:14.197 --> 31:18.747
Yeah, Detective Sipowicz is gonna bring you
up to speed on your daughter's case.

31:18.816 --> 31:20.926
The most recent developments.

31:20.997 --> 31:23.687
- Andy Sipowicz.
- John Sawyer, representing Mr. Garabedian.

31:23.756 --> 31:26.249
I'm upset with where it looks like
you're taking this.

31:26.322 --> 31:29.712
- What way is that?
- I mean, what happened to the Russian as a suspect?

31:29.785 --> 31:32.606
- This Dimitri?
- You're trying to makeJohn Arcotti the killer.

31:32.672 --> 31:35.646
I thinkJohn Arcotti is the one who needs
representation to protect his rights.

31:35.719 --> 31:38.988
I'm gonna give you some background
on what we've been finding out.

31:39.055 --> 31:40.914
Then you'll make your judgment.
All right?

31:40.979 --> 31:43.374
Have a seat here.
Please, sit down.

31:49.319 --> 31:51.729
What am I doing in this room?

31:51.857 --> 31:55.126
Well, the lieutenant must have sensed
that you were a little upset.

31:55.193 --> 31:58.015
He put you in here so you wouldn't be
so distracted. What's going on, Johnny?

31:58.080 --> 32:01.886
What's going on is, you're trying to break up
my marriage and involve me in crimes!

32:01.961 --> 32:03.940
What I attempted
was exactly the opposite!

32:04.013 --> 32:06.955
What we're trying to do is figure out
what happened to Angie Garabedian.

32:07.029 --> 32:10.233
Oh, let me tell you something.
Let me tell you some...

32:10.300 --> 32:12.344
I have been under such strain-
such strain you couldn't even believe it.

32:12.417 --> 32:15.970
- Now to have my wife told that I'm a criminal.
- Well, let's straighten it out.

32:16.042 --> 32:17.638
Let's straighten this out right now.

32:17.709 --> 32:20.366
You asked my wife...

32:20.436 --> 32:23.257
You asked my wife
about Alex Sandoval.

32:23.322 --> 32:25.181
Okay, Alex Sandoval...

32:25.247 --> 32:28.637
he came to see me in the neighborhood
of seven to 10 days ago.

32:28.711 --> 32:31.882
Now, I made a mistake in my life three
and a half years ago involving Alex Sandoval...

32:31.951 --> 32:34.772
and that was- that was that car theft
you asked me about.

32:34.837 --> 32:37.659
- The registration mix-up."
- That involved Alex Sandoval.

32:37.724 --> 32:40.698
Okay, here he comes now.
He wants us to work together. Get out and earn.

32:40.771 --> 32:43.812
Carry on like we did in the good old days.
I said, 'No, Alex. I'm married.

32:43.882 --> 32:48.202
I'm a parent, and we're staying with this lovely
person, Angie, until our own place is ready.

32:48.276 --> 32:50.135
Wonderful father
who's financially comfortable."

32:50.200 --> 32:52.792
Bottom line is,
I sent Alex on his way. Okay?

32:52.863 --> 32:58.025
And when this transpired, I thought
I was gonna vomit at what I had realized.

32:58.092 --> 33:00.103
I had given him this information.

33:00.176 --> 33:02.035
You told him about Angie.

33:02.100 --> 33:03.959
You asked Lisa my connection
with Alex Sandoval.

33:04.025 --> 33:07.065
It was the same that was on those
phone records, which is the exact way...

33:07.136 --> 33:10.078
I was able to trace Alex Sandoval-
by making those phone calls.

33:10.151 --> 33:14.569
- You were trying to find Angie.
- I was trying to find her. I was trying to save her life.

33:14.642 --> 33:18.327
So Alex's intention was to get ransom.
Is that what was going on?

33:19.998 --> 33:22.754
He was holding her ransom.

33:24.745 --> 33:26.789
Now get this.

33:26.861 --> 33:29.902
He had made a tape with instructions
on where to drop the money.

33:29.973 --> 33:33.659
- How much was he asking for?
- 75,000, I think he said.

33:33.726 --> 33:37.827
And he had made a tape to play into
the phone when the old man answers.

33:37.896 --> 33:40.652
Except when the old man answers,
he hears Hello, this is George Garabedian."

33:40.718 --> 33:44.109
- It was the old man's answering machine.
- And Alex don't realize this.

33:44.182 --> 33:46.905
No. He holds up the tape recorder, plays
the message into the phone and then hangs up.

33:46.972 --> 33:51.237
But he must've hung up before the machine
beeped on- the message don't even get on it.

33:51.303 --> 33:53.960
- He screwed up.
- Alex totally screwed up.

33:54.029 --> 33:56.456
How long after this
had Angie disappeared?

33:56.531 --> 33:59.090
What? Till I tracked him down?
It was several days.

33:59.161 --> 34:02.945
He admitted he was involved, and he said
the guy didn't pay him the money.

34:03.010 --> 34:06.531
I told him I know for a fact-
Alex, the father never got a ransom call."

34:06.602 --> 34:09.543
Because I was out there
spending days with him handing out flyers.

34:09.617 --> 34:13.554
Now, all I'm thinking- I mean, I know
I should've probably contacted the police.

34:13.626 --> 34:16.601
- You should've, Johnny.
- But my only thought is, I just want to get the girl back safe.

34:16.674 --> 34:21.025
'Cause of my knowing him,
I got a better chance of getting him to tell.

34:21.099 --> 34:24.489
So I'm asking him,
Alex, where have you got the girl?

34:24.563 --> 34:26.422
Where have you got Angie hidden?"

34:26.487 --> 34:28.916
- And that's what those phone calls were all about.
- Hmm.

34:34.795 --> 34:36.326
Now, I mean...

34:37.938 --> 34:39.853
what he must have done is...

34:39.928 --> 34:44.478
he must've gone back
and set her on fire to destroy the evidence.

34:44.547 --> 34:46.559
You know Alex Sandoval's dead.

34:46.630 --> 34:50.315
No, I know. You told my wife.
You asked her my connection.

34:55.804 --> 34:57.718
So, do you know a Don Brunelli?

35:00.198 --> 35:03.752
I know... a Don Brunelli.

35:09.789 --> 35:14.076
I believe that Don Brunelli may have been
involved with Alex in grabbing Angie.

35:14.151 --> 35:17.060
And subsequently, Don may have even-
He may have even murdered Alex.

35:17.134 --> 35:19.441
Why?
What's Don Brunelli telling you?

35:19.507 --> 35:22.329
Don Brunelli's not telling us anything, John.
Don Brunelli took off.

35:22.394 --> 35:25.435
But you and Don and Alex...

35:25.506 --> 35:29.924
were picked out by a station attendant
who sold you five dollars' worth of gasoline.

35:32.402 --> 35:35.858
And all of you were up there
on this little video monitor.

35:37.790 --> 35:40.130
- You want to know how that happened?
- Absolutely.

35:40.196 --> 35:43.170
See, now, this is exactly how
you get further and further in.

35:43.243 --> 35:45.157
I mean, I was only trying to help.

35:47.124 --> 35:49.464
But- Okay...

35:49.529 --> 35:54.012
I had finally remembered Alex had mentioned
this vacant house near where his mother lived...

35:54.083 --> 35:56.544
that he'd broken into several months ago,
and he obtained a key.

35:56.617 --> 36:00.171
- I'm finally thinking maybe this is where they have her.
- This is a couple days later?

36:00.242 --> 36:03.796
Yeah. I go, identify the place,
obtain entry, and there she is.

36:03.866 --> 36:05.626
- She's in the basement.
- Angie?

36:05.695 --> 36:08.034
Angie's in the basement.
And she's tied up.

36:08.101 --> 36:12.934
And when I go over to release her,
I realize that she's dead.

36:13.008 --> 36:15.884
And it's just that moment
when both Don and Alex, they return.

36:15.959 --> 36:19.448
- Where had they been?
- How do I know where they've been?

36:19.519 --> 36:22.788
They went out to find her a blanket,
'cause this girl was frozen to death.

36:22.854 --> 36:24.768
She was suffocated or something.

36:28.821 --> 36:30.735
Have a seat, John.

36:31.771 --> 36:34.078
- Why?
- Have a seat.

36:38.924 --> 36:41.351
So you were sure she was dead.

36:41.426 --> 36:44.817
I know.
She...

36:45.852 --> 36:47.711
She wasn't moving at all.

36:47.776 --> 36:50.598
It wasn't like she was just unconscious.
She was dead.

36:50.663 --> 36:54.283
They were kicking her and so forth.
I was afraid for my own life.

36:54.351 --> 36:58.420
I mean, I thought- I thought they were
gonna kill me because she was already dead.

36:58.490 --> 37:02.427
In order to save my own life, I said,
Let's get some gasoline and let's burn her up."

37:02.499 --> 37:06.250
- That way I would show that I was not gonna rat on them.
- You said that?

37:06.316 --> 37:09.039
I have a wife and a small child.
She was already dead.

37:10.774 --> 37:12.753
Angie had carbon in her lungs, John.

37:12.827 --> 37:16.666
She was alive when you set her on fire.
She breathed in those flames.

37:16.740 --> 37:19.298
- No way.
- No way?

37:19.370 --> 37:22.278
After all this...

37:23.316 --> 37:25.175
that I've been hearing from you...

37:25.240 --> 37:27.580
that's the best you're gonna come up with-
No way,"John?

37:27.645 --> 37:29.985
They made me do this!
They came at me!

37:30.051 --> 37:34.502
I was trying to save my life! Now look!
I'm in the exact jam they wanted me to be in!

37:34.573 --> 37:38.860
You know, John, we got a general description
on the Alex Sandoval killing.

37:38.935 --> 37:43.485
Average height. Now, Don Brunelli is,
as you know, 6 foot 3.

37:43.554 --> 37:45.468
Johnny, you're 5'10".

37:45.543 --> 37:47.457
Now, one of you killed Alex, John.

37:47.531 --> 37:50.538
And my money is on you.

37:53.947 --> 37:56.768
It was because
I was furious with grief.

37:56.833 --> 38:02.476
I mean, I did to them exactly what I swore
I'd do when they made me watch that fire.

38:02.542 --> 38:04.401
I took vengeance for Mr. Garabedian.

38:04.467 --> 38:06.326
Mm-mmm-mmm.

38:06.391 --> 38:08.469
Vengeance makes it premeditated, John.

38:11.138 --> 38:13.599
Premeditated.

38:13.672 --> 38:18.921
No, I think you'd be better off
with, uh, temporary insanity.

38:28.138 --> 38:30.413
I mean...

38:30.479 --> 38:33.388
I felt insane-
I- I was- I was exhausted.

38:33.462 --> 38:37.267
I was- You know, I was crazy with grief
that they would burn her alive.

38:39.203 --> 38:42.080
I think you got a better shot with that.

38:43.437 --> 38:45.351
It's three days.

38:46.966 --> 38:48.880
I still haven't been asleep.

39:01.335 --> 39:04.211
Yeah, man. Come on.
It's on you, Greg. It's on you.

39:04.286 --> 39:06.145
Three threes.

39:06.210 --> 39:11.273
- What? Damn!
- How the hell you get a hand like that?

39:11.342 --> 39:13.681
Greg, you must have played poker all day
down at the station house.

39:13.748 --> 39:16.471
To tell you the truth,
I don't play that much poker.

39:16.538 --> 39:19.360
Lucky as you are, you oughta start.

39:19.425 --> 39:20.955
- You something else, Greg.
- Yeah?

39:21.028 --> 39:23.937
- Maybe you're right.
- Hold on. Greg.

39:24.011 --> 39:26.767
Oh. Thanks. Hello?

39:26.835 --> 39:28.694
Yeah, that's me.

39:28.759 --> 39:30.585
Oh, yeah?

39:30.651 --> 39:33.724
That right?
So, uh, what happened?

39:33.794 --> 39:35.970
God.

39:36.040 --> 39:39.495
Well, okay, uh,
we'll wrap it up here.

39:39.568 --> 39:41.360
Yeah. Bye.

39:43.320 --> 39:45.660
That was the borough.

39:45.726 --> 39:48.253
The threat on your life, that's over.

39:48.324 --> 39:52.556
It's over? You mean the son of a bitch
that wanted to kill me changed his mind?

39:52.622 --> 39:56.307
- No. Turns out somebody whacked him.
- He got whacked?

39:56.374 --> 39:58.321
Y'all hear that?

39:58.395 --> 40:01.949
- Woodrow got whacked.
- He must've had a whole lot of enemies.

40:02.020 --> 40:06.733
What do you think of that? Somebody
went over and canceled my contract on him.

40:06.799 --> 40:09.587
- What you think of that?
- What do you mean, what I think of it?

40:09.653 --> 40:11.961
Well, what do you think about it?

40:12.027 --> 40:14.137
I don't think nothin'.

40:15.427 --> 40:19.210
Well, let's go out
and get something to eat!

40:19.276 --> 40:22.250
- Yeah, I hear you.
- That sounds good.

40:22.323 --> 40:25.779
I can handle that.
That sounds like a winner to me.

40:25.851 --> 40:27.995
Put Greg's money together for him.

40:28.065 --> 40:30.175
- Oh, okay.
- Hey, thanks a lot.

40:31.207 --> 40:33.766
So, uh, point of information, Bob.

40:33.838 --> 40:37.075
Where were you
before you came up here?

40:37.141 --> 40:40.444
- I was shooting pool.
- That Bob shoots a mean stick.

40:40.509 --> 40:43.615
- Where were you, Bob? Over atJane Street?
- Yeah.

40:43.685 --> 40:46.506
And I bet you weren't shooting
by yourself, were you?

40:46.571 --> 40:48.485
I never shoot by myself.

40:52.056 --> 40:54.780
My coat. Grimes!
Grimes, wake up!

40:57.285 --> 40:59.811
- We're through here, Grimes.
- What's goin'on?

40:59.882 --> 41:01.927
Game's over.

41:07.772 --> 41:10.046
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, Greg.

41:10.114 --> 41:12.508
I understand these things.

41:12.583 --> 41:15.142
Sarge tells me you collared up
on that torch guy.

41:15.214 --> 41:17.609
- Yeah. Doin' the fives.
- Yeah.

41:17.684 --> 41:19.411
They, uh-
They shut my detail down.

41:19.479 --> 41:21.272
Yeah, huh?

41:21.340 --> 41:24.129
I was watching this policy guy,
Good News Gates.

41:24.195 --> 41:27.235
Yeah. This guy, Woodrow,
had a contract out on him.

41:27.306 --> 41:30.313
- Winds up whacked himself.
- Gates had that done?

41:30.385 --> 41:32.014
Well, the thought occurred to me.

41:32.085 --> 41:35.988
Woodrow was shot in the 27, so I told 'em
to look at a guy that worked for Gates.

41:36.062 --> 41:38.107
This huge, cross-eyed guy
named Bob.

41:38.179 --> 41:42.466
- Mm-hmm.
- Anyway, see, I'm playing poker with these guys.

41:42.541 --> 41:45.035
Professional gamblers.

41:45.107 --> 41:47.054
I win 312 bucks.

41:47.128 --> 41:49.949
- You're kidding me.
- I haven't played poker since I was a kid.

41:50.014 --> 41:52.923
I was running bluffs,
every other damn thing.

41:52.997 --> 41:55.074
- Hmm.
- Three hundred and twelve bucks!

41:55.147 --> 42:00.046
Greg, you sure these guys
weren't just, you know, keeping you happy?

42:00.118 --> 42:02.775
Nah. Hey, uh...

42:03.935 --> 42:06.274
I wouldn't imagine so.

42:06.341 --> 42:09.697
I mean, t-t-they're not
even from our precinct.

42:11.440 --> 42:13.682
Anyways, uh,
I'm going upstairs.

42:13.750 --> 42:15.609
Uh, tell Andy I said good night.

42:15.675 --> 42:18.332
Yeah.
Night, Greg.

42:21.705 --> 42:26.899
Look, that kind of talk doesn't
do anybody any good, Mr. Garabedian.

42:28.568 --> 42:31.510
Um, I'm gonna be here
for another 45 minutes.

42:31.584 --> 42:33.443
And you got my home number, right?

42:33.508 --> 42:35.717
Okay.

42:35.785 --> 42:37.994
Yeah.
Take care.

42:40.403 --> 42:42.065
Father's bad, huh?

42:42.136 --> 42:46.783
They better be heads-up with the
metal detectors when they arraign thatJohnny.

42:46.851 --> 42:49.027
This guy is liable to go after him.

42:49.096 --> 42:50.955
This kid's got no remorse.

42:51.021 --> 42:55.636
Twenty years from now, he's still gonna be
working on a new wrinkle, grounds for an appeal.

42:55.703 --> 42:57.562
A master criminal.

42:57.627 --> 43:03.008
Meanwhile he's working on his escape
digging a tunnel at night with a fork.

43:03.081 --> 43:05.705
- Probably break through into a septic tank.
- Hey, guys.

43:07.058 --> 43:08.917
Hey, how's it going, Vince?

43:08.982 --> 43:12.055
- Hear you collared up on that torch job.
- Uh-huh.

43:12.125 --> 43:15.811
- One of the guys you questioned was tattooed like the D.O. A?
- Yeah.

43:15.878 --> 43:18.568
- Had one of those unicorns?
- Mm-hmm. Russian guy.

43:18.636 --> 43:23.054
I figured it was important, that tattoo.
I just didn't know where it fit.

43:28.195 --> 43:31.318
He chose this job
over a career in neurosurgery.
