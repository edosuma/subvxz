I mean, I could've,
if those pinhead bureaucrats

35:41.208 --> 35:42.475

a few more weeks.

35:42.477 --> 35:43.976
I know I could have cracked it.

shut you down.

36:05.132 --> 36:07.599
And you thought there was
another reason.

36:07.601 --> 36:10.001
The government wanted
a system, Harold.

36:10.003 --> 36:11.870
They weren't just going
to give up.

They let Congress shut us down,

anyone off the scent.

I'm two years sober.

36:47.039 --> 36:48.571
Why?

36:48.573 --> 36:51.441
Because back when I was doing
a lot of stupid things,

36:51.443 --> 36:53.710
drinking was one of them.

36:53.712 --> 36:57.213
And then this jackass in a suit
showed up on my backseat

36:57.215 --> 36:58.948
and forced me at gunpoint
to help him

36:58.950 --> 37:02.051
