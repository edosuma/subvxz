Who are you?

01:29.739 --> 01:31.573
Austin emt, ma'am.
Are you mrs. Beard?

01:31.592 --> 01:33.317
Yes. What happened?
Where's steve?

01:33.335 --> 01:35.243
Mr. Beard has had
a medical emergency.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.320
He called 911.

01:36.338 --> 01:37.487
He's lost a lot of blood.

01:37.506 --> 01:39.656
Oh no, not my steve.
Let me see him?

01:39.675 --> 01:41.433
Has your husband
had surgery recently?

01:41.585 --> 01:43.102
No, no. He's never sick.

01:43.253 --> 01:44.845
He's gonna be all right,
isn't he?

01:44.997 --> 01:46.605
'cause he has to be.
He's my whole life.

01:51.928 --> 01:53.186
Here you go, sugar.

01:53.339 --> 01:56.673
Vodka tonic with
a twist of lime.

01:56.675 --> 01:58.191
I didn't even order yet.

01:58.344 --> 02:00.953
Oh, I saw you put in your dinner
order so I had your drink made.

02:01.029 --> 02:02.955
Unless you're not
drinking tonight, mr. Beard.

02:03.106 --> 02:06.683
Now, celeste, we both know
I'm gonna drink that

02:06.685 --> 02:08.127
And then I'm gonna order
another one.

02:08.203 --> 02:10.203
When your prime rib arrives.

02:10.356 --> 02:12.464
I guess I'm a creature of habit.

02:12.541 --> 02:16.468
Did you go to the cemetery
again today?

02:16.620 --> 02:20.714
It's only been a few weeks
since elise passed.

02:20.866 --> 02:23.976
I can't seem to figure out
what to do without her.

02:24.127 --> 02:27.980
Well, do what I'd do
and go shopping.

02:28.131 --> 02:30.540
It always makes me
feel better.

02:30.559 --> 02:32.484
Yeah, I woke up this morning
and I was feeling a little glum

02:32.636 --> 02:35.487
And then I went
and I got myself this.

02:37.232 --> 02:40.217
And now I feel like
a million bucks.

02:40.219 --> 02:41.718
You know, I'll take you
next time.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.069
Get you a new blazer.

02:43.146 --> 02:45.389
A man like you should not be
repeating your outfits.

02:45.391 --> 02:46.907
My wife bought me this blazer.

02:47.059 --> 02:49.984
Oh, there I go putting my foot
in my mouth again.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.578
No, I like it.

02:51.730 --> 02:53.839
You speak your mind.

02:53.916 --> 02:57.417
Why do you think I keep
finishing my days here?

02:57.569 --> 02:59.511
You make an old man happy,
celeste.

02:59.588 --> 03:02.514
Oh, mr. Beard, you say that
to all the ladies.

03:02.591 --> 03:04.499
No, I don't.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.077
There's something special
about you.

03:07.095 --> 03:08.428
You ready for another one?

03:08.580 --> 03:09.855
Yes, please.

03:11.007 --> 03:12.432
You better tip me better
this time.

03:12.584 --> 03:14.193
None of that 10 percent crap.

03:14.344 --> 03:15.861
I'm a single mother.

03:18.774 --> 03:21.441
Another vodka tonic, please.

03:21.593 --> 03:22.592
Want it stiff?

03:22.611 --> 03:24.945
Oh, hon, I always
want it stiff.

03:25.097 --> 03:27.280
[laughs]

03:27.433 --> 03:29.099
So what's the plan?

03:29.101 --> 03:30.876
Just gonna flirt
with all these guys

03:30.953 --> 03:32.544
Until one of them
takes you home?

03:32.621 --> 03:34.454
No, I can get any one of them
to take me home

03:34.606 --> 03:38.032
But that doesn't pay my bills
or get my girls new clothes.

03:38.052 --> 03:41.053
No, I'm waiting for a shot
at a better life.

03:41.129 --> 03:44.965
And right now that shot
is over there

03:45.117 --> 03:47.392
Waiting for his vodka
and prime rib.

03:50.122 --> 03:51.230
Thank you.

03:55.644 --> 03:58.070
When are you gonna
have dinner with me, celeste?

03:58.221 --> 03:59.571
Whenever you want.

03:59.648 --> 04:00.797
How about tonight?

04:00.799 --> 04:01.889
Here?

04:01.909 --> 04:02.908
Of course not.

04:03.059 --> 04:04.150
I'm talking about something

04:04.303 --> 04:07.246
That isn't sitting
under a heating lamp.

04:07.322 --> 04:09.248
Sounds good to me.

04:09.399 --> 04:11.250
Just give me a sec.

04:13.996 --> 04:15.829
Goodnight, stacey.

04:15.981 --> 04:19.073
You can't leave, you still have
two hours left on the clock.

04:19.093 --> 04:22.928
Yeah, can't miss my shot.

04:23.079 --> 04:29.268
Oh, and uh, cancel the prime rib
over on table 12.

04:32.848 --> 04:34.273
How do you feel about steak?

04:34.424 --> 04:35.515
Sounds great.

04:35.667 --> 04:37.276
Especially in good company.

04:37.352 --> 04:38.443
I'm gonna make sure you get

04:38.595 --> 04:40.670
The best damn steak dinner
you've ever had.

04:40.672 --> 04:42.339
Oh, well I'm all for women's lib

04:42.341 --> 04:46.285
But I do love a man who knows
how to take care of a woman.

04:46.436 --> 04:47.935
<i>Kristina: Someone's home late.</i>

04:47.955 --> 04:49.788
For good reason.

04:51.107 --> 04:53.625
Mama's moving up in the world.

04:53.777 --> 04:55.109
Did you get a promotion?

04:55.129 --> 04:58.797
Oh, I won't be needing that job
much longer.

04:58.874 --> 05:00.114
[exhales]

05:00.134 --> 05:02.134
Did you get fired?

05:03.286 --> 05:05.529
Wow. You're just like
your sister,

05:05.547 --> 05:07.639
Always thinking the worst.

05:07.791 --> 05:10.050
Where is she, by the way?
Is she asleep?

05:10.202 --> 05:12.936
What, is she sleeping over
at david's again?

05:14.130 --> 05:15.722
Are they having sex?

05:15.874 --> 05:17.316
Remind me to make sure
she's on the pill.

05:17.467 --> 05:18.483
Mom! Oh my-

05:18.560 --> 05:19.801
What? What?

05:19.820 --> 05:21.061
When you get a boyfriend
of your own

05:21.213 --> 05:23.638
You're gonna wanna come
and talk to me.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.732
Mama's got a thing or two
she could teach you.

05:25.884 --> 05:27.784
Can we talk about
something else?

05:29.237 --> 05:31.237
What happened to your job?

05:32.391 --> 05:37.577
Well, I guess we could tell
jennifer the good news tomorrow,

05:37.729 --> 05:41.840
But your mama met a man

05:41.917 --> 05:45.085
And things are about to get
a lot better around here.

05:45.237 --> 05:47.012
Just you wait.

05:47.163 --> 05:49.181
Mama has a plan.

05:51.426 --> 05:52.809
Here we are.

05:54.003 --> 05:55.745
Wow.

05:55.747 --> 05:58.005
Steve.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.858
What a place.

06:00.009 --> 06:04.437
Why'd you wait a month
to show it off?

06:04.590 --> 06:07.366
Is that our dinner in there?

06:07.442 --> 06:11.703
I thought I'd have the
restaurant come to us tonight.

06:11.780 --> 06:15.707
Well, you certainly know how
to pull out all the stops.

06:21.456 --> 06:22.714
Thank you.

06:26.220 --> 06:29.054
I just sold my tv station
for a hell of a lot,

06:29.205 --> 06:31.965
And with elise gone I've got
nothing but money, time,

06:32.117 --> 06:35.060
And nobody to spend it on
except you.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.859
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

06:49.559 --> 06:50.575
Huh.

06:50.652 --> 06:52.077
Why don't you take
some of that money

06:52.154 --> 06:55.247
And redecorate around here?

06:55.398 --> 06:57.064
I mean, no offense,

06:57.084 --> 07:00.902
But this place is more like
a museum than a home.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.422
Elise put a lot of thought
into all of this.

07:03.573 --> 07:08.427
Well, I mean, I'm sure she did,
25 years ago.

07:08.503 --> 07:09.928
Come on, steve.

07:10.079 --> 07:14.433
You're more fun than all this
beige and velour.

07:14.584 --> 07:17.102
You're a lot feistier
than most women around here.

07:17.253 --> 07:20.346
They're all worried
about blending in.

07:20.499 --> 07:23.108
Not me, sugar.
Mmm-mmm.

07:23.185 --> 07:27.020
No, I was born to stand out.

07:27.172 --> 07:28.905
Here's to standing out.

07:36.773 --> 07:39.349
Well, you know a girl could
get used to luxury like this.

07:39.367 --> 07:41.275
You deserve luxury like this,
celeste.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.110
Oh, no, not me.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.130
I mean, I don't need all these
bells and whistles,

07:45.207 --> 07:47.466
But my girls, oh.

07:47.617 --> 07:50.117
They deserve so much more.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.804
They haven't had
the easiest life.

07:54.475 --> 07:57.033
I miss having someone
to take care of,

07:57.035 --> 07:59.644
And it gets lonely here
by myself.

07:59.796 --> 08:01.629
Why don't y'all move in?

08:01.648 --> 08:04.040
Steven beard.

08:04.059 --> 08:05.558
I mean, we've been dating
for a month.

08:05.711 --> 08:06.651
What will people say?

08:06.803 --> 08:08.211
Screw 'em.

08:08.230 --> 08:10.322
I'm old enough to know
that worrying what people think

08:10.473 --> 08:12.232
Is a waste of time.

08:12.384 --> 08:18.905
Well, you know, I agree
with that, but...

08:19.057 --> 08:22.000
I'm a respectable woman,
I don't know.

08:22.151 --> 08:23.668
What if I hired you?

08:25.321 --> 08:27.172
As a house manager.

08:27.323 --> 08:29.674
You and your daughters
could sleep in your own wing

08:29.826 --> 08:34.254
And I could keep you close
and take care of you.

08:34.406 --> 08:37.349
House manager?

08:37.500 --> 08:39.851
Oh, steve.

08:39.928 --> 08:41.594
If I slept under the same
roof as you

08:41.747 --> 08:43.855
I don't think I could
trust myself.

08:43.932 --> 08:46.082
From what?

08:46.084 --> 08:49.510
From wanting to sleep
next to you.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.530
Move in with me, celeste.

08:56.945 --> 08:59.612
I guess I got the job.

08:59.765 --> 09:01.706
Girls, I hope you're ready.

09:01.858 --> 09:03.708
Our new life is waiting.

09:05.620 --> 09:07.379
Were you out shopping while
we packed up the apartment?

09:07.530 --> 09:09.548
You know shopping
keeps me sane.

09:09.624 --> 09:10.957
Come on, here, here.

09:11.109 --> 09:13.552
We're moving across town.
We have to look the part.

09:19.451 --> 09:21.451
Mama, this is beautiful.

09:21.469 --> 09:23.186
Woah, is this for real?

09:26.141 --> 09:27.715
Nu-uh.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.901
You make us drink milk after its
expiration date to save money.

09:29.978 --> 09:31.552
There is no way
we can afford these.

09:31.572 --> 09:32.887
We can't.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.222
But steve's gold card can.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.983
He lets you use his card?

09:37.135 --> 09:40.637
I told you, he wants all three
of us to be happy.

09:40.655 --> 09:43.081
We deserve that, don't we?

09:43.158 --> 09:44.641
You know, this is nice
and all,

09:44.659 --> 09:46.492
But it still seems a little
soon for us

09:46.645 --> 09:49.421
To just move into his house
without even meeting the guy.

09:49.572 --> 09:50.922
What if we hate him?

09:51.074 --> 09:53.741
Jennifer, why do you always
have to see a problem, hmm?

09:53.760 --> 09:55.093
Why can't you...

09:55.170 --> 09:56.653
Why can't you just do what
I ask, like your sister?

09:56.655 --> 09:58.171
I don't know, celeste.

09:58.323 --> 10:00.265
When are you gonna stop treating
kristina like a personal slave?

10:00.416 --> 10:03.268
I told you to stop
calling me celeste.

10:03.419 --> 10:06.271
Now, besides, the house is huge!

11:04.480 --> 11:05.722
I love it.

11:05.740 --> 11:07.499
It's just a little housewarming
gift from you.

11:07.650 --> 11:10.502
Oh, celeste, you certainly like
to shop.

11:10.653 --> 11:12.153
Well, as long as you two
like them

11:12.172 --> 11:14.321
I'll take all the credit
for your mom's shopping.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.899
Where should we put
our stuff?

11:15.901 --> 11:17.509
Well, just leave them there
for now.

11:17.660 --> 11:19.585
Burgers are almost ready.
Are you girls hungry?

11:19.738 --> 11:20.970
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

11:26.261 --> 11:30.689
Celeste, girls, meet
my little girl, becky.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.524
It's nice to meet y'all.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.768
I know my dad is very excited
to have you in the house.

11:35.921 --> 11:37.178
Come with me, girls.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.772
Your father has told me
so much about you.

11:39.925 --> 11:44.928
He's so proud of how you
teach math and live in dallas.

11:44.930 --> 11:47.613
And he's told me almost
nothing about you.

11:47.766 --> 11:49.432
I'm just here to take care
of your father

11:49.451 --> 11:52.210
And this beautiful house,

11:52.361 --> 11:55.171
And that's really all
you need to know.

11:57.792 --> 11:59.551
Kristina, jennifer,

11:59.627 --> 12:02.554
I'm so pleased to finally
meet the two of you.

12:02.705 --> 12:06.466
Your mom has told me all
about her beautiful babies.

12:06.618 --> 12:10.211
And now for the important
question.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.230
How do you like
your hamburgers?

12:13.308 --> 12:15.734
Every Wednesday around here
is burger night

12:15.885 --> 12:18.570
And there are a lot of tough
decisions to be made.

12:18.721 --> 12:23.132
Ketchup, mustard, relish,
tomato, bacon, cheese.

12:23.134 --> 12:24.892
I'm gonna pass out here.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.077
You wanna jump in?

12:26.154 --> 12:27.820
Ketchup and cheese, please.

12:27.973 --> 12:29.489
Mustard and a pickle for me.

12:29.641 --> 12:31.374
Now you're talking.

12:33.236 --> 12:34.586
He seems nice, mom.

12:34.662 --> 12:36.755
Told you this was a step up
from our apartment.

12:36.831 --> 12:38.590
More like ten steps.

12:38.741 --> 12:40.425
So is your room just down
the hall or something?

12:40.576 --> 12:41.926
Something like that.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.746
You're sleeping with him?

12:45.766 --> 12:46.914
You just figured that out?

12:46.933 --> 12:49.750
But you said you were
the house manager.

12:49.770 --> 12:54.347
I'm the lady of the house,
so it's the same thing.

12:54.499 --> 12:56.608
Goodnight, my darling girls.
Sleep tight.

12:58.427 --> 13:01.279
Celeste is always working
some angle, kris.

13:01.356 --> 13:03.114
You gotta know that by now.

13:03.191 --> 13:05.283
I really like him.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.692
Maybe he'll be good for her.

13:06.845 --> 13:08.453
At least it'll be better
than her dumping us

13:08.604 --> 13:10.863
In foster care again.

13:11.016 --> 13:12.273
You think she's gonna
marry him?

13:12.292 --> 13:15.201
A house like this?
She's damn well gonna try.

13:36.541 --> 13:38.983
And you've had plenty

Today we become a family,

15:06.406 --> 15:09.482
But her? Really?

15:09.634 --> 15:12.468
Everyone's talking about how
your new girlfriend, uh, wife,

15:12.470 --> 15:15.062
Is younger than your
own daughter.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.231
It's embarrassing.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.565
I don't trust her.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.992
But I do, honey.

15:20.145 --> 15:22.253
I trust her with my life.

15:22.330 --> 15:24.255
And since when did I care
what other people think?

15:24.407 --> 15:25.648
Since when did you?

15:25.650 --> 15:27.592
I taught you better than that.

15:27.669 --> 15:29.427
Poor mom.

15:29.504 --> 15:30.653
What would she say?

15:30.672 --> 15:33.097
She would want me
to be happy.

15:33.174 --> 15:34.265
Becky, sweetheart?

15:34.417 --> 15:35.433
Mm?

15:35.584 --> 15:38.177
Before celeste came along
I was so lonely.

15:38.329 --> 15:40.104
I don't wanna live the rest
of my life like that.

15:40.256 --> 15:41.180
Is that a crime?

15:41.332 --> 15:42.665
No.

15:42.684 --> 15:45.109
The crime is celeste just loves
you for your money.

15:45.261 --> 15:46.945
Well, she'd be an idiot
not to love my money,

15:47.096 --> 15:48.095
Don't you think?

15:48.114 --> 15:49.021
[laughs]

15:49.174 --> 15:52.842
Well, and I am not an idiot.

15:52.860 --> 15:54.935
You know, becky, I thought
signing the prenup

15:54.955 --> 15:57.956
Would put all this gold digger
talk to rest.

15:58.107 --> 16:01.292
I am here for your father
in sickness and in health,

16:01.369 --> 16:02.961
Just like the minister said.

16:03.112 --> 16:04.295
You signed a prenup.

16:04.447 --> 16:05.612
Of course.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.633
I'm not the greedy bitch
you make me out to be.

16:08.784 --> 16:11.803
Now maybe you'll give me
the benefit of the doubt.

16:13.640 --> 16:17.308
Come on, big daddy.
We're needed for a toast.

16:17.385 --> 16:19.552

You're gonna be okay, baby.

16:26.802 --> 16:28.135
You're gonna be okay.

16:28.154 --> 16:31.047
Please, please don't let
anything happen to my husband!

16:31.065 --> 16:32.548
He's my guardian angel!

16:32.567 --> 16:33.974
Please!

16:33.994 --> 16:39.405
[sobbing]

16:39.557 --> 16:41.390
Excuse me, mrs. Beard?

16:41.409 --> 16:42.649
Yes.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.727
Detective rollins, my partner
detective gates.

16:44.746 --> 16:46.912
Were you with your husband
when he made the 911 call?

16:47.065 --> 16:48.172
No.

16:48.324 --> 16:50.733
No, I was... I was asleep
in my daughter's room

16:50.752 --> 16:52.010
On the other side
of the house.

16:52.086 --> 16:53.344
Is there any reason

16:53.421 --> 16:55.329
Why you were in your daughter's
room, mrs. Beard?

16:55.348 --> 17:00.076
Steve snores so much, I don't
always sleep in the same room.

17:00.078 --> 17:01.519
Did you hear anything?

17:01.670 --> 17:04.263
No, no, I didn't.
Did you hear anything?

17:04.415 --> 17:06.024
No, no, nothing.

17:06.100 --> 17:07.933
Is there an alarm system
in the house?

17:08.086 --> 17:09.752
We got a shell here.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.864
I'm gonna have to ask you ladies
to step out, please.

17:13.015 --> 17:13.939
This is my bedroom.

17:14.016 --> 17:16.868
Sorry, this is a crime
scene now.

17:16.944 --> 17:19.353

17:19.372 --> 17:22.040
Come on, mama.

17:22.116 --> 17:23.041
[sobbing]

17:28.864 --> 17:30.364
-How's he doing?
-Thanks.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.050
Uh, he's still in surgery.

17:32.201 --> 17:35.536
Um, I'm gonna go find
some more tissue.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.554
Okay.

17:37.965 --> 17:41.375
Kristina, do you know if
your father was suicidal?

17:41.394 --> 17:43.619
Wha... No, no.

17:43.638 --> 17:45.137
He and my mom were leaving

17:45.290 --> 17:47.398
On a month-long trip
to europe tomorrow.

17:47.550 --> 17:49.734
Do you know anybody who would
want to hurt him?

17:49.811 --> 17:51.069
Kristina?

17:55.724 --> 17:56.741
Is he gonna be okay?

17:56.818 --> 17:58.317
We don't know yet.

17:58.469 --> 18:00.970
He's still in surgery.

18:00.988 --> 18:02.972
Detective rollins, apd.

18:02.990 --> 18:04.582
You must be the other daughter.

18:04.733 --> 18:05.917
Detective?

18:08.588 --> 18:12.090
They think that someone
shot steve.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.482
Did you see anyone?

18:13.501 --> 18:14.667
No.

18:14.819 --> 18:16.319
We were sleeping
in my room.

18:16.337 --> 18:19.764
The first thing I heard was
the police banging on the door.

18:19.915 --> 18:21.081
Mrs. Beard?

18:21.101 --> 18:23.750
Do you mind if I ask you
a few more questions?

18:23.770 --> 18:26.329
Sure, if... If it helps steve,
yes, anything.

18:26.347 --> 18:30.274
Some of my questions might be
a little... Personal.

18:30.426 --> 18:32.276
Maybe we could speak in private.

18:34.597 --> 18:36.614
I'll be okay, here.

18:39.935 --> 18:41.786
Personal questions, detective?

18:41.937 --> 18:44.455
How does that help figure out
what happened to steve?

18:44.607 --> 18:46.290
What was the state of
your marriage, mrs. Beard?

18:46.442 --> 18:48.275
Were you and mr. Beard happy?

18:48.294 --> 18:49.869
Happy?

18:50.021 --> 18:52.130
Of course we were happy.

18:52.206 --> 18:54.799
I love him and he loves me.

18:54.950 --> 18:57.026
Marrying steve beard
was the best thing

18:57.044 --> 18:58.636
That ever happened to me.

18:58.713 --> 19:01.197
How do you spend over $300,000
in two months?

19:01.215 --> 19:03.048
I've never seen anyone spend
money like you.

19:03.201 --> 19:05.885
If you keep this up
there won't be anything left.

19:06.037 --> 19:08.888
Yeah, well, I wanna enjoy
my life now.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.874
Not 20 years from now.

19:11.893 --> 19:13.467
Is that so wrong?

19:13.486 --> 19:16.154
I set up a joint account
that you have full access to,

19:16.305 --> 19:17.971
But my private accounts
are just that.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.490
Private.

19:19.642 --> 19:20.825
Yeah, well I went to the bank
to put some traveler's checks

19:20.976 --> 19:24.403
In the safety deposit box
and you know what I saw?

19:24.555 --> 19:26.330
Your dead wife's jewelry.

19:26.482 --> 19:32.411
Now how can I be your wife
when she is everywhere I look?

19:32.563 --> 19:35.339
That's elise's jewelry
and I'm saving it for becky.

19:35.491 --> 19:37.082
Ugh.

19:37.343 --> 19:41.237
Celeste, what did you do?

19:41.255 --> 19:43.681
I just had it appraised,
all right?

19:43.758 --> 19:44.682
We can get it back.

19:44.833 --> 19:46.258
You don't respect anything.

19:46.411 --> 19:47.927
You don't understand me!

19:48.079 --> 19:49.912
You're right, maybe I don't.

19:49.931 --> 19:52.481
I don't know how we're gonna
make this work.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.027
Are you gonna divorce me?

19:58.256 --> 19:59.697
You can't do that to me.

20:02.851 --> 20:04.368
Is everything okay?

20:05.613 --> 20:07.688
I heard yelling.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.523
Your mother's just upset,
darling.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.167
Don't you worry.

20:26.951 --> 20:27.708
Fine!

20:27.727 --> 20:28.784
Mama!

20:28.803 --> 20:29.802
You don't want me
around anymore?!

20:29.954 --> 20:32.063
No, mama, please stop!

20:32.139 --> 20:33.472
Put the gun down!

20:33.624 --> 20:34.398
I'll just kill myself.

20:34.550 --> 20:35.624
Nobody's getting a divorce.

20:35.643 --> 20:37.050
[sobbing]
mama, stop!

20:37.070 --> 20:37.884

20:40.131 --> 20:42.465
You don't wanna do this.
We can work it out.

20:42.483 --> 20:43.741
Give big daddy the gun.

20:46.153 --> 20:48.246

my mom needs help.

21:04.413 --> 21:07.431
Okay, well, your mama's
gonna get better.

21:07.583 --> 21:09.658
I promise.

21:09.677 --> 21:10.935
I love you, mama.

21:11.012 --> 21:12.328
I'll see you soon.

21:12.330 --> 21:14.772
I think this is gonna be
really good for you.

21:14.923 --> 21:16.565
All right.

21:26.677 --> 21:29.620
<i> I'd like to welcome celeste</i>
<i> to our group.</i>

21:29.772 --> 21:33.866
Celeste, would you like
to introduce yourself?

21:34.018 --> 21:35.184
Sure.

21:35.202 --> 21:40.965
Um, hi, I'm celeste
and I'm here because...

21:41.116 --> 21:43.801
Well, I'm crazy like y'all.

21:43.878 --> 21:46.211
Celeste, we try to use
our group time

21:46.364 --> 21:48.639
To focus on our own experience

21:48.791 --> 21:53.644
And not pass judgement
on anyone else.

21:53.796 --> 21:58.390
I'm here because my home life
can be...

21:58.543 --> 22:00.967
I don't know, overwhelming.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.212
My husband is controlling

22:03.214 --> 22:07.158
And I find it hard to deal
with sometimes.

22:07.234 --> 22:10.386
All right, we can work on that.

22:10.404 --> 22:11.737
Welcome, celeste.

22:11.889 --> 22:13.331
Group: Welcome.

22:13.482 --> 22:15.166
Thank you.

22:21.156 --> 22:22.131
Doughnut?

22:23.992 --> 22:25.009
How'd you get those in here?

22:25.086 --> 22:26.844
I made one of my daughters
bring 'em.

22:26.921 --> 22:29.496
Slipped the guard 50 bucks
not to rat me out.

22:29.515 --> 22:32.257
[laughs]

22:32.410 --> 22:34.018
Do you wanna join me?

22:38.599 --> 22:42.360
This group therapy thing
is so difficult for me.

22:42.511 --> 22:44.028
Doesn't it bother you,
sitting around,

22:44.105 --> 22:47.272
Sharing your problems
with complete strangers?

22:47.425 --> 22:49.200
Maybe it used to.

22:49.351 --> 22:51.184
Now I can handle it better.

22:51.204 --> 22:52.870
Dr. Hester says it makes me
more accountable

22:52.947 --> 22:55.522
If other people can hear
what I'm saying, too.

22:55.541 --> 22:59.952
Well, if dr. Hester says it
then it must be true.

23:00.104 --> 23:01.712
[laughs]

23:01.864 --> 23:03.547
Is this your first time here?

23:03.624 --> 23:07.443
My first and only.

23:07.461 --> 23:09.795
I'd rather go to a spa
and get massages

23:09.947 --> 23:13.799
Than sit in these god awful
chairs and trade stories about

23:13.951 --> 23:16.227
Who had it worse growing up.

23:16.378 --> 23:18.120
It's my third time.

23:18.122 --> 23:19.471
What?

23:20.066 --> 23:21.381
What's so wrong with you?

23:21.401 --> 23:22.474
[laughs]

23:22.627 --> 23:24.235
Depression.

23:24.386 --> 23:26.128
It gets bad sometimes.

23:26.130 --> 23:28.313
So bad I hear voices.

23:28.466 --> 23:29.740
Hmm.

23:29.817 --> 23:32.801
And I have a bad habit of
choosing the wrong women.

23:32.820 --> 23:35.154
I tend to get my heart broken
a lot.

23:35.306 --> 23:36.897
Hmm.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.250
It sounds like you're just
a sucker for love.

23:41.162 --> 23:42.253
Maybe.

23:42.404 --> 23:45.256
But a sucker doesn't get angry
and I do.

23:48.744 --> 23:50.502
Rumor had it I ran over
my ex-girlfriend's husband

23:50.655 --> 23:52.321
With my truck.

23:52.323 --> 23:53.597
What?

23:55.326 --> 23:56.434
Did you?

23:57.586 --> 23:59.995
No.

24:00.014 --> 24:01.939
But I thought about it.

24:02.016 --> 24:03.607
[laughing]

24:04.518 --> 24:05.926
Welcome back, buttercup.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.504
Oh, I missed you so much.

24:08.522 --> 24:11.507
And I missed our home
and our life,

24:11.509 --> 24:15.619
And I even missed those
ugly beige drapes.

24:15.696 --> 24:18.104
Oh, steve, let's redecorate.

24:18.124 --> 24:21.942
I mean, this house could use
a clean slate.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.869
You just said you missed
the drapes.

24:24.021 --> 24:25.278
Oh, sweetie.

24:25.298 --> 24:28.707
Sweetie, let's not have any more
beige in our lives.

24:28.859 --> 24:31.694
Don't we deserve a fresh start?

24:31.712 --> 24:34.805
Well, I did some thinking
while you were gone

24:34.957 --> 24:37.866
And I'm sure we can work it out,
can't we?

24:37.885 --> 24:39.310
Oh, baby.

24:39.461 --> 24:41.979
You know I want nothing more
than to make you happy

24:42.130 --> 24:43.372
And be a good wife.

24:43.390 --> 24:46.817
And I know I can do it.

24:46.894 --> 24:49.320
I realize I was just in denial
over what I went through

24:49.471 --> 24:50.654
When I was a kid

24:50.806 --> 24:53.899
And I was just... I was
taking it out on you.

24:54.051 --> 24:57.386
Oh, hon. I'm so sorry.

24:57.388 --> 24:59.830
But I'm glad the therapy helped.

24:59.982 --> 25:01.740
You're right.

25:01.892 --> 25:04.001
Let's get rid of all the beige.

25:04.152 --> 25:06.152
No more beige.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.412
No more beige?

25:07.565 --> 25:09.006
No more.

25:09.157 --> 25:11.008
[laughing]
no more beige!

25:12.586 --> 25:14.920
There you are.

25:15.072 --> 25:16.588
I've been wanting to do
something for you

25:16.741 --> 25:18.574
For the last six weeks.

25:18.592 --> 25:20.667
A signature nail color.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.578
And now that we're free...

25:22.580 --> 25:24.413
I'm not really someone
that gets manicures.

25:24.431 --> 25:26.506
Everybody needs a good manicure,
honey.

25:26.526 --> 25:28.433
Don't worry, you'll still
look like yourself.

25:28.586 --> 25:30.753
Just a little more stylish.

25:30.755 --> 25:32.846
Celeste, I'm... I'm not sure.

25:32.865 --> 25:36.033
Tracey tarlton, you deserve
to look and feel your best

25:36.110 --> 25:38.944
Both inside and out.

25:39.096 --> 25:41.205
Now come on, this is part of
your recovery

25:41.282 --> 25:44.691
And your road to self-love.

25:44.710 --> 25:48.954
Please, let me pamper
you already.

25:49.106 --> 25:50.789
Yes, I will.

25:50.941 --> 25:51.940
Good.

25:51.959 --> 25:54.793
Now, shut up and enjoy
the ride.

25:54.945 --> 25:56.220
You've told me about tracey.

25:56.371 --> 25:58.889
You know tracey's obsessed
with your mom.

25:59.041 --> 26:00.115
You need to tell them.

26:00.117 --> 26:01.541
Your mother's trying
to figure out

26:01.561 --> 26:03.468
What's going on with
your father's surgery.

26:03.621 --> 26:04.728
I didn't catch your name.

26:04.805 --> 26:05.712
Jennifer.

26:05.731 --> 26:06.955
Jennifer and...?

26:06.957 --> 26:07.806
David.

26:07.958 --> 26:08.640
Wittmer.

26:08.793 --> 26:10.067
David wittmer.

26:10.144 --> 26:11.735
And you two were um,

26:11.812 --> 26:13.237
You were out of the house
this evening, yeah?

26:13.388 --> 26:14.738
We were staying at david's.

26:14.815 --> 26:16.632
Any of you three wondering

26:16.650 --> 26:18.801
Who might have done this
to mr. Beard?

26:18.803 --> 26:20.894
Someone broke into the house.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.562
Wasn't it the robber
that shot him?

26:22.582 --> 26:25.249
That's what I'm trying
to figure out here.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.976
Have you asked tracey tarlton?

26:27.995 --> 26:29.086
Tracey tarlton?

26:29.163 --> 26:30.737
She's a friend of celeste's.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.923
She might want steve gone.

26:33.075 --> 26:37.169
Please don't tell our mom
that we told you that.

26:37.321 --> 26:38.337
Tracey tarlton?

26:38.489 --> 26:39.988
Yes.

26:40.007 --> 26:41.006
Can I help you?

26:41.158 --> 26:43.083
Detective rollins,
detective gates.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.510
We'd like to ask you a couple
of questions about steve beard.

26:45.663 --> 26:46.419
Steve?

26:46.439 --> 26:48.254
He's been shot.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.998
That's awful.

26:50.017 --> 26:51.350
What happened?
Is he...

26:51.502 --> 26:52.835
Touch and go.

26:52.853 --> 26:54.612
Mind if we talk inside?

26:54.763 --> 26:56.614
Are you close with mr. Beard?

26:58.266 --> 26:59.617
I know him through a friend.

26:59.768 --> 27:03.454
Is that friend celeste beard?

27:03.605 --> 27:06.957
She's okay, by the way,
in case you were worried.

27:07.109 --> 27:09.534
That's good.
I was gonna ask.

27:09.687 --> 27:11.036
Of course you were.

27:11.188 --> 27:15.023
Where were you between the
hours of midnight and 3:00 am?

27:15.042 --> 27:18.135
Um... Sleeping.

27:18.212 --> 27:20.863
We found a shotgun shell
in their bedroom.

27:20.881 --> 27:22.214
20 gauge.

27:22.366 --> 27:25.309
Do you own a shotgun, tracey?

27:25.386 --> 27:28.720
20- 20 gauge?
I uh... I don't...

27:28.873 --> 27:30.722
You might wanna think real hard

27:30.875 --> 27:33.817
About what you're about to say
because if you lie to us now

27:33.969 --> 27:36.561
We're just gonna go back,
get a warrant, come back here,

27:36.714 --> 27:38.881
And search your premises.

27:38.883 --> 27:41.141
Either way, I have a feeling
we're gonna find

27:41.160 --> 27:43.327
A 20-gauge shotgun in
the house somewhere.

27:43.478 --> 27:45.829
What do you think, tracey?
Is that feeling correct?

28:00.587 --> 28:01.345
Step away.

28:01.496 --> 28:03.013
Step away!

28:06.911 --> 28:08.352
What do you know.

28:17.771 --> 28:20.030
Miss tarlton here ran her truck
over some guy

28:20.182 --> 28:21.773
She got into an argument with.

28:21.926 --> 28:23.867
They were both drinking.

28:24.853 --> 28:26.704
Man, that looks painful.

28:26.855 --> 28:30.374
Well, she's got a flair
for the dramatic.

28:30.525 --> 28:32.209
How're you holding up, tracey?

28:32.360 --> 28:33.526
It's been a long day.

28:33.546 --> 28:34.786
Long day?

28:34.939 --> 28:37.289
Steve beard just got out
of a four-hour surgery.

28:37.441 --> 28:39.942
It's been a long day for him
and his family, too.

28:39.944 --> 28:41.552
You know, at any minute now
I bet ballistics

28:41.703 --> 28:43.721
Is gonna walk through that door
with a report

28:43.797 --> 28:46.631
That says it was your gun
that shot steve beard.

28:46.784 --> 28:48.392
And then we'll be charging you

28:48.469 --> 28:51.636
With the aggravated assault
of steve beard.

28:51.789 --> 28:53.897
Anything else
you wanna tell us?

28:54.049 --> 28:55.640
Now is your chance to work
with us before it's-

28:55.793 --> 28:59.194
I did it.
I shot steve beard.

29:00.965 --> 29:02.906
You wanna tell us why?

29:04.410 --> 29:07.819
Did you ever read a real good
romance novel, detective?

29:07.972 --> 29:11.582
A story where someone is
so in love

29:11.733 --> 29:15.660
That it can't help but end
in tragedy?

29:15.813 --> 29:18.589
Are you in love, tracey?

29:20.334 --> 29:22.259
I did it for celeste.

29:25.322 --> 29:30.993
I shot steve because
I love celeste.

29:31.011 --> 29:35.013
And does mrs. Beard know that
you shot her husband for her?

29:35.165 --> 29:38.275
She knows I care about her.

29:38.426 --> 29:41.169
But celeste had nothing
to do with this.

29:41.188 --> 29:44.189
You are lucky steve beard
didn't die.

29:44.341 --> 29:47.284
Because otherwise you'd be
looking at the death penalty,
tracey,

29:47.361 --> 29:50.012
With no possibility of bail.

29:50.030 --> 29:51.288
I can get bail?

29:54.518 --> 29:55.942
<i> Kristina: Mama will be</i>
<i> right back.</i>

29:55.961 --> 29:59.296
She's been holding your hand
since you got out of surgery.

29:59.447 --> 30:01.632
We're just really happy
that you're okay.

30:01.708 --> 30:02.800
[knocking]

30:02.951 --> 30:04.042
Mind if we come in?

30:04.194 --> 30:05.527
He can't really talk right now.

30:05.546 --> 30:06.545
We'll be quick.

30:06.697 --> 30:09.031
I just thought you should know
that uh,

30:09.049 --> 30:11.291
Tracey tarlton confessed
to shooting you.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.868
We'll be charging her
with aggravated assault.

30:12.886 --> 30:14.127
Tracey?

30:14.146 --> 30:15.813
I told you they'd catch
who did this, daddy.

30:15.889 --> 30:20.818
Mr. Beard, do you know
tracey tarlton?

30:20.969 --> 30:23.654
Just blink once for yes, sir.

30:23.805 --> 30:24.880
Was tracey tarlton,

30:24.898 --> 30:26.548
She was friends with your wife,
sir?

30:26.550 --> 30:28.567
She was!

30:28.719 --> 30:30.160
I let her into our home.

30:30.237 --> 30:33.221
I can't believe she would do
something like this.

30:33.240 --> 30:34.498
[exhales]

30:34.649 --> 30:36.058
Are you okay, big daddy?

30:36.076 --> 30:37.668
You don't have to answer
any questions.

30:37.819 --> 30:40.003
It's just a few questions,
mrs. Beard.

30:40.155 --> 30:42.673
Can I talk to you outside,
please?

30:45.493 --> 30:48.345
Listen, I will answer whatever
questions you have

30:48.496 --> 30:51.923
But that angel of a man
almost died yesterday.

30:52.076 --> 30:54.576
Please let him recover,
for god's sake.

30:54.595 --> 30:55.927
Can you just tell us how
you became friends

30:56.080 --> 30:58.522
With tracey tarlton?

30:58.673 --> 31:01.191
Well, some women
have the junior league,

31:01.343 --> 31:03.085
I had tracey tarlton.

31:03.087 --> 31:04.695
Are you in a romantic
relationship

31:04.846 --> 31:06.104
With tracey tarlton?

31:06.256 --> 31:08.532
Me? No, of course not.

31:08.683 --> 31:10.367
You've never been intimate
with tracey tarlton?

31:10.518 --> 31:12.594
What kind of question is that?

31:12.613 --> 31:15.038
I am a respectable
married woman.

31:15.115 --> 31:16.264
Well, miss tarlton
seems to imply

31:16.283 --> 31:17.782
That the feelings
were mutual.

31:17.935 --> 31:21.027
The only mistake I made was
being friends with that woman.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.213
Now, I never should have tried
to help her.

31:23.365 --> 31:26.550
So miss tarlton came up
with the idea

31:26.627 --> 31:28.960
Of shooting your
husband herself?

31:29.113 --> 31:33.724
Please, my family has been
through a very traumatic event

31:33.800 --> 31:36.635
And our lawyer says I don't have
to speak to you,

31:36.787 --> 31:39.396
So please just let him heal

31:39.547 --> 31:42.399
Without this pointless
harassment.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.908
[sighs]

31:52.486 --> 31:56.138
Oh. Oh, honey, the awful
detectives are gone.

31:56.156 --> 32:00.642
Now we can just focus on being
together and getting steve home.

32:00.661 --> 32:02.753
Did they say anything
about tracey?

32:02.904 --> 32:03.921
Oh, sugar.

32:04.072 --> 32:07.165
I just... I never should
have trusted her.

32:07.317 --> 32:10.594
It just goes to show you never
know what someone is hiding.

32:10.745 --> 32:13.263
If you had been in bed with him
she could have shot you, too.

32:13.340 --> 32:18.101
Oh. I'm just grateful that
we're all here together, safe.

they arrested her.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.772
Um...

32:39.792 --> 32:42.626
I'm gonna tell her to never call
me again, all right?

32:42.703 --> 32:45.854
She is out of our lives forever,

32:45.872 --> 32:48.799

care of this.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.200
<i> I can't talk to you now.</i>

32:58.202 --> 32:59.643
I told them I did it.

33:01.629 --> 33:03.605
I did it because I love you.

<i> Celeste?</i>

33:36.907 --> 33:39.257
I was never the housekeeper!

33:39.409 --> 33:40.759
Mom, maybe we could do
something fun today?

33:40.911 --> 33:42.352
We could go shopping.

33:42.504 --> 33:45.930
Kris, we gotta go to school and
someone needs to check on steve.

33:46.083 --> 33:47.190
We could go to neiman's,

collections in.

Your sister's right.

Celeste, this is serious.

35:02.509 --> 35:04.509
I know it's serious, sugar.

35:04.661 --> 35:06.661

That's a little fancy for me.

35:35.709 --> 35:37.375
I'm not exactly going out

You can be as fancy
as you want

your living room.

You'll know I'm thinking
about you.

35:45.035 --> 35:47.144
I don't know what to say.

35:47.295 --> 35:49.312
I thought you were
ignoring me.

35:49.464 --> 35:51.648
Of course not, sugar.

35:51.799 --> 35:54.317
Look, I wanted to find
the casing, I really did,

35:54.394 --> 35:57.729
But steve called 911

35:57.881 --> 36:01.324
And then the police showed up
so fast.

36:01.476 --> 36:03.551
I didn't want them to find it.

36:03.570 --> 36:06.663

<i> You know I'm always going</i>
<i> to take care of you.</i>

36:32.098 --> 36:32.914
I'm here, big daddy.

36:32.933 --> 36:35.417
How are you feeling today?

36:35.435 --> 36:37.527
Oh, oh, no, no.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

36:37.679 --> 36:39.863
Doctor says you're not out
of the woods entirely.

36:40.014 --> 36:42.848
But you are making
good progress.

36:42.868 --> 36:47.111
Slowly and surely is the name
of the game.

36:47.264 --> 36:49.097
Becky?

36:49.099 --> 36:53.543
She was here a few days ago.
She had to go back to dallas.

36:53.620 --> 36:54.878
How does this sound?

36:55.029 --> 36:56.621
I'll throw a fun party
for your birthday.

36:56.773 --> 36:57.772
It'll be right around
thanksgiving

36:57.791 --> 36:59.532
And you should be home
by then.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.534
Becky can be there
with the girls.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.778
Does that sound good?

37:03.797 --> 37:05.538
That sounds perfect.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.892
Oh... All this has got
me thinking,

37:08.969 --> 37:11.619
If anything were to ever
happen to you

37:11.638 --> 37:13.471
I don't know what I'd do.

37:13.623 --> 37:17.234
You've been so important to me
and the girls.

37:17.385 --> 37:18.626
I would hate for them

37:18.645 --> 37:21.813
To lose this amazing life
you've given us.

37:21.965 --> 37:24.908
I made sure you and the girls
were taken care of.

37:24.985 --> 37:27.652
I know and you've been
so good to us.

37:27.804 --> 37:31.473
You're truly are our knight
in shining armor.

37:31.491 --> 37:34.659
It's just that, well...

37:34.811 --> 37:37.420
You know, becky doesn't
like me too much.

37:37.572 --> 37:40.239
Well, I worry she would just
take everything away

37:40.259 --> 37:42.000
If you passed.

37:42.152 --> 37:46.321
The trust I set up for you,
no one can touch that.

37:46.339 --> 37:48.581
I know.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.600
But the house.

37:50.677 --> 37:54.829
You know, I... I don't wanna
worry you about that right now.

37:54.848 --> 37:57.165
I just hate that everything
you worked for,

37:57.183 --> 38:01.945
Becky could just sell it all off
if she wanted to.

38:02.022 --> 38:03.929
Call bill.

38:03.949 --> 38:07.358
I'll change my will right now.

38:07.511 --> 38:10.528
You should get half
of everything.

38:10.680 --> 38:11.788
Oh...

38:11.939 --> 38:14.365
Would that make you
feel better?

38:14.518 --> 38:16.518
You would do that for us?

38:16.520 --> 38:19.354
Oh, the girls
will be so relieved.

38:19.356 --> 38:21.856
Oh, you are my angel.

How about these?

38:30.534 --> 38:31.641
They haven't been worn.

38:31.718 --> 38:34.794

anything to wear.

Don't push me!

38:40.802 --> 38:41.893
All right?

38:42.045 --> 38:43.653

something I'm not

38:43.805 --> 38:45.989
And I can't handle it!

38:46.140 --> 38:48.900

You're my angel.

40:05.720 --> 40:07.904
Ugh, what a drag.

40:07.981 --> 40:11.074
And they searched
through everything.

40:11.225 --> 40:12.650
And I mean everything.

40:12.802 --> 40:15.078
Yeah, they took
my chocolate bars.

40:15.229 --> 40:16.729
But not my cigarettes,
funnily enough.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.748
[laughs]

40:19.826 --> 40:21.418
Steve's been so awful.

40:21.569 --> 40:23.478
He's so controlling.

40:23.496 --> 40:26.147
The other day he said
I wasn't pretty enough

40:26.166 --> 40:27.406
To leave the house.

40:27.426 --> 40:29.092
So he took my car keys.

40:29.169 --> 40:32.262
I was trapped at the house
until he came home.

40:32.413 --> 40:34.672
And every day it's something
like that.

40:34.824 --> 40:36.933
I just don't know how much
I can take of it.

40:37.084 --> 40:39.494
Are you gonna divorce him?

40:39.496 --> 40:40.845
'cause then you and I
could just-

40:40.997 --> 40:42.439
No, the prenup doesn't give me
anything worthwhile

40:42.515 --> 40:44.682
If we get divorced.

40:44.834 --> 40:49.446
And it's not like I can just
give him a heart attack.

40:49.597 --> 40:51.698
I'll think of something.

40:53.526 --> 40:55.910
Mmm. My neck is killing me.

41:00.533 --> 41:02.250
You wanna give me a rub down?

41:18.384 --> 41:21.293
-Feels good.
-You've got group therapy.

They're saying that tracey and I
had an affair

41:41.224 --> 41:44.483
And then I put her up
to shooting steve.

41:44.503 --> 41:47.578
An affair, really?
That's just ridiculous.

41:47.731 --> 41:50.006
Well, at least we know
who hurt my steve.

41:50.157 --> 41:53.568
I can tell you from experience

41:53.586 --> 41:56.513
That tracey is hoping she
doesn't have to go back to jail.

54:58.704 --> 55:02.706
Now, I can't help it if she had
some deranged obsession with me

55:02.858 --> 55:05.467
And thought she needed
to kill steve.

55:05.619 --> 55:10.121
Did you marry steve
for his money?

55:10.141 --> 55:13.809
Do you think he married me
for my cooking?

55:13.886 --> 55:15.369
The truth, please.

55:15.387 --> 55:20.632
Look, it wasn't always easy,
being married to steve.

55:20.651 --> 55:25.654
He was demanding
and he yelled a lot.

55:25.731 --> 55:28.824
But he was a loving man to me
and my daughters

55:28.901 --> 55:31.568
And I couldn't have asked
for a better husband.

55:31.720 --> 55:33.070
Good.

55:33.222 --> 55:35.164
That's what we'll tell them.

55:37.910 --> 55:44.247
Now, I can get you out
on bond

55:44.400 --> 55:45.490
While we get ready
for the trial,

55:45.509 --> 55:47.417
But you be a good girl
out there, celeste.

55:47.570 --> 55:50.846
What you do matters
and people are watching.

55:53.425 --> 55:55.976
[door opens, closes]

55:58.522 --> 56:00.597
[exhales]

56:00.749 --> 56:02.766
<i> Hello? My babies?</i>

56:02.918 --> 56:05.361
Well, aren't you happy
to see me?

56:05.512 --> 56:08.922
Mama's out on bail.

56:08.924 --> 56:11.700
I missed you, my babies.

56:11.852 --> 56:12.868
I missed you, too, mama.

56:13.019 --> 56:15.278
Mmm.

56:15.431 --> 56:17.280
Well, jennifer?

56:17.433 --> 56:19.116
Don't you have anything you
wanna say to me?

56:19.268 --> 56:21.118
I missed you, too, celeste.

56:21.270 --> 56:22.378
Hmm.

56:22.529 --> 56:26.456
Of all days you couldn't be nice
to me today, huh.

56:26.609 --> 56:29.776
Well, I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna go to bed.

56:29.795 --> 56:31.703
But tomorrow, kristina,
you and me,

56:31.722 --> 56:35.616
We're gonna go shopping
because you deserve a treat.

56:35.634 --> 56:37.709
Have fun.

56:37.728 --> 56:39.061
We will.

56:40.623 --> 56:41.897
Goodnight.

56:55.246 --> 56:55.986
[gunshot]

56:56.138 --> 56:57.654
<i> Celeste: Big daddy!</i>

56:57.806 --> 56:59.706
[echoing voices]

57:01.401 --> 57:03.419
[panicked breathing]

57:30.189 --> 57:33.023
Mama, did you hear me?

57:33.175 --> 57:35.617
Oh, no, sorry, sugar.

57:35.694 --> 57:36.860
What'd you say?

57:37.012 --> 57:39.529
I said how much is this lawyer
gonna cost?

57:39.682 --> 57:43.959
I heard nick masters is the most
expensive lawyer in austin.

57:44.110 --> 57:45.961
Mm, well, that's not right, hon.

57:46.112 --> 57:49.465
He is the most expensive lawyer
in texas.

57:49.616 --> 57:51.708
And doesn't your mama deserve
the best?

57:51.860 --> 57:55.119
You do, but can we afford it?

57:55.139 --> 57:57.547
You're starting to sound
like steve.

57:57.700 --> 58:00.200
Oh, we need to get our
nails done after the mall.

58:00.219 --> 58:02.144
Call heather, will you?

58:03.706 --> 58:04.888
What?

58:05.040 --> 58:06.648
You're normally so excited
for our shopping days.

58:06.800 --> 58:08.225
Aren't you gonna get dressed?

58:08.377 --> 58:09.985
I've got school, mama.

58:10.062 --> 58:11.653
And I don't think that we should
be spending money

58:11.730 --> 58:14.214
Like that anymore.

58:14.233 --> 58:19.953
Come on, just one day.
It'll be like old times.

58:23.242 --> 58:27.077
All right, fine.

58:27.229 --> 58:30.321
If you're so worried
about money

58:30.341 --> 58:32.341
See what you can get
for these.

58:35.495 --> 58:39.681
It's like jennifer believes
everything that's in the papers

58:39.833 --> 58:41.683
And soon enough she'll have
kristina believing

58:41.760 --> 58:42.518
The same thing.

58:42.669 --> 58:43.910
A gold digger.

58:43.929 --> 58:45.762
That's what my daughters
are gonna think of me.

58:45.914 --> 58:48.081
You will always be their mama.

58:48.100 --> 58:49.599
It's just a rough time.

58:49.752 --> 58:53.603
Everything I do,
I do for my girls.

58:53.756 --> 58:55.013
They know that, right?

58:55.032 --> 58:56.031
They do, yes.

58:56.108 --> 58:59.535
And in the meantime,
you stay strong.

58:59.611 --> 59:01.537
[sighs]

59:01.613 --> 59:03.705
Oh, heather, I don't wanna
go to jail.

59:03.857 --> 59:06.616
Oh, hon, you get that thought
out of your head right now.

59:06.769 --> 59:08.526
It's not gonna happen.

59:08.546 --> 59:12.673
If only tracey tarlton
would shut her stupid mouth.

59:14.293 --> 59:17.386
You really think she'd say
something that could hurt you?

59:17.462 --> 59:20.556
Tracey would say anything
to save herself.

59:20.632 --> 59:22.949
Well, I could maybe help you
find a solution

59:22.968 --> 59:26.377
To your tracey problem.

59:26.397 --> 59:27.788
Oh yeah?

59:27.806 --> 59:29.472
How're you gonna do that?

59:29.625 --> 59:30.974
Poison nail polish?

59:31.126 --> 59:33.569
[laughs]

59:33.720 --> 59:38.815
I know a couple of people
from when I was inside

59:38.967 --> 59:40.576
Who could help.

59:46.083 --> 59:46.807
<i> Kristina: Mama? Mama?</i>

59:46.825 --> 59:47.808
<i> Celeste: Mmm.</i>

59:47.810 --> 59:49.084
Come on, let's get you to bed.

59:49.161 --> 59:50.568
<i> Jennifer: You're not her</i>
<i> caretaker, kristina.</i>

59:50.588 --> 59:53.755
If she wants to pass out
on the couch again, let her.

59:53.832 --> 59:57.092
You know, I know you don't like
me very much, jennifer,

59:57.169 --> 1:00:00.503
But deep down inside
you love me.

1:00:00.656 --> 1:00:04.266
I'm your mama and I always
will be.

1:00:04.417 --> 1:00:06.993
Mama, mama, please.

1:00:06.995 --> 1:00:08.103
Come on.

1:00:08.254 --> 1:00:10.272
Mmm.

1:00:10.423 --> 1:00:13.257
You would love it if I just
killed myself, wouldn't you?

1:00:13.277 --> 1:00:14.759
I didn't say that.

1:00:14.778 --> 1:00:17.112
You know, why don't we all
just kill ourselves, hmm?

1:00:18.690 --> 1:00:24.177
Turn the gas on
and just go to sleep.

1:00:24.196 --> 1:00:26.455
We'll be together forever.

1:00:26.606 --> 1:00:28.790
That would be perfect.

1:00:35.207 --> 1:00:36.465
Come on, kristina.

1:00:36.541 --> 1:00:37.799
Come stay with us
at david's tonight.

1:00:37.951 --> 1:00:38.967
I can't leave her.

1:00:39.044 --> 1:00:40.377
She just talked
about killing us.

1:00:40.529 --> 1:00:41.378
Mom would never hurt us.

1:00:41.530 --> 1:00:43.805
Are you sure about that?

1:00:43.882 --> 1:00:47.868
Look, I get that
she's a crappy mother

1:00:47.870 --> 1:00:49.886
But that doesn't mean
that she's a killer.

1:00:50.038 --> 1:00:52.205
I love you, kristina,

1:00:52.207 --> 1:00:56.877
But I won't stick around
to find out.

1:00:56.879 --> 1:00:58.820
You shouldn't, either.

1:01:04.477 --> 1:01:06.453
<i> Kristina: Sit down.</i>
<i> Do you want coffee?</i>

1:01:09.741 --> 1:01:10.724
What's all this?

1:01:10.726 --> 1:01:11.908
I thought I'd help out

1:01:12.060 --> 1:01:13.669
With some of the paperwork
that's piling up.

1:01:13.820 --> 1:01:15.170
Just trying to make sense
of it all.

1:01:15.321 --> 1:01:16.246
That's a good idea.

1:01:16.398 --> 1:01:18.231
I could use a secretary.

1:01:18.842 --> 1:01:23.178
I uh, I wanna help, mama.
I really do.

1:01:23.255 --> 1:01:24.587
Oh, my sweet girl.

1:01:24.740 --> 1:01:27.849
But I um...

1:01:27.926 --> 1:01:32.020
I think maybe you need
to get some help.

1:01:32.097 --> 1:01:34.523
I... The trial's in a month

1:01:34.674 --> 1:01:36.933
And things are only gonna get
more stressful around here.

1:01:37.085 --> 1:01:40.270
Maybe you could use a little bit
of time at terrace view.

1:01:40.422 --> 1:01:43.532
Your sister put you up to this.

1:01:43.608 --> 1:01:46.593
I don't know what to do anymore,
mama.

1:01:46.595 --> 1:01:49.279
I'm trying to help
but I'm scared.

1:01:49.431 --> 1:01:51.948
I don't want you
to go to jail.

1:01:52.100 --> 1:01:56.770
Oh, sweetie, I get scared
sometimes, too.

1:01:56.788 --> 1:02:02.792
I promise you,
I'm not going to jail.

1:02:02.945 --> 1:02:07.055
A few days off, though,
might be just what I need.

1:02:10.894 --> 1:02:12.728
Call them for me.

1:02:12.879 --> 1:02:14.354
Of course.

1:02:34.993 --> 1:02:39.496
Good morning, sarah.
Celeste beard checking in.

1:02:39.648 --> 1:02:40.589
All right, mrs. Beard.

1:02:40.665 --> 1:02:42.090
I have some papers
for you to sign.

1:02:42.167 --> 1:02:45.093
I'm paying cash so this is
how it's gonna go.

1:02:45.170 --> 1:02:47.170
I want a private room,
no group therapy,

1:02:47.322 --> 1:02:48.822
Massages every day,

1:02:48.840 --> 1:02:51.007
And I will have my food
brought in.

1:02:51.159 --> 1:02:52.993
Um, that's not how
it works here.

1:02:53.011 --> 1:02:54.160
If I can have you sign-

1:02:54.162 --> 1:02:55.103
Sarah.

1:02:57.165 --> 1:02:59.257
Why aren't you agreeing
with me?

1:02:59.276 --> 1:03:01.443
I mean, clearly I'm crazy.

1:03:08.010 --> 1:03:09.359
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:03:09.511 --> 1:03:12.120
Um, is heather coming in today?

1:03:12.197 --> 1:03:13.847
Uh, heather doesn't
work here anymore.

1:03:13.849 --> 1:03:15.698
But what do you need?
Mani? Pedi?

1:03:15.851 --> 1:03:17.292
No, thanks.

1:03:17.443 --> 1:03:18.868
Do you know where she went?

1:03:19.021 --> 1:03:20.295
I couldn't tell you.

1:03:20.446 --> 1:03:22.464
She walked up in here like
the queen of England, quit,

1:03:22.615 --> 1:03:24.282
Said she was moving.

1:03:24.301 --> 1:03:25.300
Thanks.

1:03:28.213 --> 1:03:30.138
I've been uh, sorting through
your paperwork.

1:03:30.290 --> 1:03:31.364
It's been piling up.

1:03:31.383 --> 1:03:32.699
Oh, good.

1:03:32.717 --> 1:03:36.645
Well, I knew you'd be a good
little secretary.

1:03:36.796 --> 1:03:38.888
There's a bunch of papers
from the bank.

1:03:39.041 --> 1:03:41.817
Um, you wrote heather a check
for $10,000.

1:03:41.968 --> 1:03:43.652
What was that for?

1:03:46.048 --> 1:03:47.564
It was a nail emergency.

1:03:47.716 --> 1:03:51.159
For $10,000?

1:03:51.311 --> 1:03:52.719
I'm joking.

1:03:52.721 --> 1:03:53.903
Geez.

1:03:54.056 --> 1:03:56.981
Laugh a little,
you need it.

1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:58.725
You know, you're never gonna
find a boyfriend

1:03:58.743 --> 1:04:00.226
If you don't smile
every once in a while.

1:04:00.228 --> 1:04:02.745
What was it for, mama?

1:04:02.898 --> 1:04:04.005
You are no fun.

1:04:04.157 --> 1:04:06.232
The bank wants to know
for accounting.

1:04:06.251 --> 1:04:07.917
It was a loan, all right?

1:04:08.070 --> 1:04:10.011
Heather found herself
in a bit of a pickle

1:04:10.163 --> 1:04:12.663
And she said
she'd pay it back.

1:04:12.683 --> 1:04:14.349
Did she?

1:04:14.426 --> 1:04:17.501
Where are my dumplings?
Did you forget my dumplings?

1:04:17.521 --> 1:04:21.431
Heather doesn't work
at the salon anymore.

1:04:21.583 --> 1:04:24.267
You went looking for her?

1:04:24.419 --> 1:04:27.937
I just wanted to ask her
about the check.

1:04:28.090 --> 1:04:30.532
Look, I appreciate you being
my little secretary

1:04:30.683 --> 1:04:34.018
But don't you ever snoop around
behind my back like that again.

1:04:34.037 --> 1:04:35.704
Do you hear me?

1:04:37.357 --> 1:04:39.040
I hear you.

1:04:45.107 --> 1:04:47.107
Look, heather needed a loan,
all right?

1:04:47.125 --> 1:04:49.792
And despite what
you might think of me,

1:04:49.945 --> 1:04:51.778
I like to help people.

1:04:51.780 --> 1:04:53.630
I'm not all bad, hon.

1:04:53.782 --> 1:04:57.133
Not everyone is blessed
with money like we are.

1:04:57.285 --> 1:04:58.518
You're right.

1:05:13.911 --> 1:05:15.151
<i> Voicemail: This is</i>
<i> heather's phone.</i>

1:05:15.303 --> 1:05:16.152
<i> Please leave a message.</i>

1:05:16.304 --> 1:05:18.655
Hey, heather.
It's celeste.

1:05:18.807 --> 1:05:20.415
Where the hell are you?

1:05:20.566 --> 1:05:23.084
My daughter told me you quit
the salon.

1:05:23.161 --> 1:05:26.755
Don't make me come looking
for you.

1:05:26.831 --> 1:05:29.407
And you better not be talking
to the police about me.

1:05:29.426 --> 1:05:31.551
We had a deal.

1:05:43.256 --> 1:05:44.180
Where does this go?

1:05:44.332 --> 1:05:45.941
Is this steve's life insurance?

1:05:52.783 --> 1:05:54.950
No, this is ours.

1:05:57.454 --> 1:05:59.621
Mom took out $50,000
life insurance policies

1:05:59.698 --> 1:06:02.624
On each of us
a few weeks ago.

1:06:05.537 --> 1:06:07.187
No.

1:06:07.205 --> 1:06:09.113
No, she wouldn't.
She's our mother.

1:06:09.132 --> 1:06:11.691
She was just talking about us
all dying together.

1:06:11.710 --> 1:06:14.636
Kristina, this is proof.
Mom's dangerous.

1:06:14.787 --> 1:06:16.212
First, she set up tracey and-

1:06:16.364 --> 1:06:18.456
We don't know
she set up tracey.

1:06:18.475 --> 1:06:19.975
Think about it.

1:06:20.051 --> 1:06:23.052
Without us in the way she gets
a lot more of steve's money.

1:06:23.205 --> 1:06:25.221
If she had to choose between us
and steve's money

1:06:25.373 --> 1:06:27.482
Which do you think
would win?

1:06:28.634 --> 1:06:29.967
Pack a bag.

1:06:29.987 --> 1:06:31.878
We're staying at david's.

1:06:31.896 --> 1:06:33.822
I know who I have
to talk to.

1:06:35.550 --> 1:06:38.384
I never thought
you'd show up here.

1:06:38.403 --> 1:06:41.054
I wasn't gonna.

1:06:41.056 --> 1:06:48.244
But after steve died
and my mom...

1:06:48.396 --> 1:06:52.841
I'm so, so, so, so sorry,
kristina.

1:06:52.992 --> 1:06:55.343
I'm ashamed of
what I did.

1:06:55.495 --> 1:06:57.403
I will never forgive myself.

1:06:57.405 --> 1:07:00.590
What happened, tracey?

1:07:00.742 --> 1:07:04.686
Did she ask you
to shoot steve?

1:07:04.763 --> 1:07:07.522
I thought I was keeping
her safe.

1:07:07.599 --> 1:07:09.691
Keeping her safe from what?

1:07:09.842 --> 1:07:12.769
From steve.

1:07:12.921 --> 1:07:15.679
She said that he controlled her.

1:07:15.699 --> 1:07:17.590
Threatened to hurt her.

1:07:17.609 --> 1:07:20.777
Tracey, steve would never
do that.

1:07:20.929 --> 1:07:23.446
He loved us.

1:07:23.598 --> 1:07:26.041
Well, how could I be so stupid.

1:07:28.712 --> 1:07:31.120
I believed everything
celeste said.

1:07:31.273 --> 1:07:33.048
She's good at that.

1:07:34.793 --> 1:07:37.218
It's not just you.

1:07:37.370 --> 1:07:39.279
She told me that if she went
to europe with him

1:07:39.281 --> 1:07:40.889
That she would come back
in a coffin.

1:07:40.965 --> 1:07:41.890
[sighs]

1:07:43.285 --> 1:07:45.894
She said that he would force her
to suicide.

1:07:46.045 --> 1:07:48.021
Or he would kill her himself.

1:07:51.459 --> 1:07:53.526
I shot him to save her.

1:08:00.318 --> 1:08:02.243
That's what I'm gonna say
in court.

1:08:04.155 --> 1:08:06.247
I... I wish... I wish you
could have heard her.

1:08:06.399 --> 1:08:09.492
It sounded so real.

1:08:09.644 --> 1:08:11.377
I wish I could prove it.

1:08:13.906 --> 1:08:16.424
Now it's just my word
against hers.

1:08:24.417 --> 1:08:28.161
Oh no. What'd she do now?

1:08:28.163 --> 1:08:30.772
She's checking herself
out of terrace view.

1:08:30.923 --> 1:08:35.426
She left these on the voicemail
at the house.

1:08:35.445 --> 1:08:36.853
[beep]

1:08:37.005 --> 1:08:40.523
<i> Voicemail: Kris, it's mama.</i>
<i> I'm ready to come home.</i>

1:08:40.675 --> 1:08:42.433
<i> Come get me.</i>

1:08:43.954 --> 1:08:46.121
<i> Voicemail: Why aren't you</i>

<i> Don't you dare make me</i>

1:08:48.366 --> 1:08:50.441
<i> After everything I've done</i>
<i> for you girls!</i>

1:08:50.460 --> 1:08:51.292
[beep]

1:08:51.369 --> 1:08:53.019
Did she call you?

1:08:53.037 --> 1:08:56.131
My phone was off while
I was visiting tracey.

1:09:01.212 --> 1:09:02.804
<i> Voicemail: Why are you</i>
<i> making me wait?</i>

1:09:02.955 --> 1:09:06.032
<i> You're acting like a little</i>
<i> bitch, kristina.</i>

1:09:06.050 --> 1:09:07.884
<i> Just like your sister.</i>

1:09:08.036 --> 1:09:09.126
What do we do?

1:09:09.146 --> 1:09:10.887
Going home isn't an option,
that's for sure.

1:09:11.039 --> 1:09:12.647
Maybe if we just ignore her
she'll stop.

1:09:12.724 --> 1:09:14.983
No, she won't stop.

1:09:17.228 --> 1:09:19.879
David, do you have a tape
recorder we could use?

1:09:19.898 --> 1:09:22.231
Uh, yeah, but these voicemails
are all saved-

1:09:22.384 --> 1:09:24.659
No, it's not
for the voicemails.

1:09:24.810 --> 1:09:26.736
Every time we talk to her
from here on out

1:09:26.888 --> 1:09:28.388
We have to record it.

1:09:28.406 --> 1:09:32.333
That way she can't lie about
anything she's saying or doing.

1:09:32.410 --> 1:09:33.559
I'm in.

1:09:33.578 --> 1:09:35.837
But david and I will pick
her up.

1:09:35.988 --> 1:09:37.988
If she calls you can record it
from here.

1:09:38.008 --> 1:09:39.340
Okay.

1:09:44.664 --> 1:09:45.680
Hey!

1:09:48.259 --> 1:09:49.350
Oh my god.

1:09:55.417 --> 1:09:56.524
It's about freaking time!

1:09:56.676 --> 1:09:58.026
Where the hell is your sister?

1:09:58.177 --> 1:09:59.360
Nice to see you, too, celeste.

1:09:59.437 --> 1:10:01.696
Oh, don't you celeste me,
jennifer.

1:10:01.847 --> 1:10:03.364
I know your games.

1:10:03.441 --> 1:10:05.992
Now, why isn't your sister
picking up the phone?

1:10:17.380 --> 1:10:18.713
[phone ringing]

1:10:24.054 --> 1:10:25.445
Hi, mama.

1:10:25.447 --> 1:10:26.946
Where have you been?!

1:10:26.948 --> 1:10:28.890
Why'd you make me wait so long?!

1:10:29.041 --> 1:10:32.301
I've done nothing but to shower
you in love and gifts

1:10:32.454 --> 1:10:34.395
<i> And this is how you treat me?</i>

1:10:34.472 --> 1:10:36.122
<i> You know what I grew up with?</i>

1:10:36.140 --> 1:10:39.141
<i> A father who didn't like me</i>
<i> and a mother who didn't care.</i>

1:10:39.294 --> 1:10:40.309
<i> And you and your sister</i>

1:10:40.462 --> 1:10:42.886
<i> Are acting like spoiled</i>
<i> little bitches.</i>

1:10:42.906 --> 1:10:47.316
Now, I am coming home
and I expect you to be there

1:10:47.469 --> 1:10:49.893
And support your mother.

1:10:49.913 --> 1:10:51.895
No, mama, I won't be home.

1:10:51.915 --> 1:10:52.914
What?

1:10:52.991 --> 1:10:54.582
Did you just say no to me?

1:10:58.255 --> 1:11:00.313
I don't know what you are
telling your sister

1:11:00.331 --> 1:11:02.590
But she has turned on me!

1:11:02.742 --> 1:11:07.336
You know, I could kill her.
I should kill both of you!

1:11:07.489 --> 1:11:09.764
Now drive!
I wanna go home!

1:11:09.915 --> 1:11:11.724
I've been waiting long enough.

1:11:12.660 --> 1:11:15.753
Kristina, she's home.

1:11:15.772 --> 1:11:18.606
And she practically threatened
to kill you after she hung up.

1:11:22.837 --> 1:11:26.339
She's dangerous, kristina.

1:11:26.341 --> 1:11:29.617
We're not safe
until she's in jail.

1:11:29.769 --> 1:11:33.863
The trial is next week
so we need to do something.

1:11:34.015 --> 1:11:35.515
Do you think you could get her
to tell you

1:11:35.533 --> 1:11:38.293
What really happened
with tracey?

1:11:41.447 --> 1:11:43.965
You mean like record
a confession?

1:11:46.194 --> 1:11:47.427
Here.

1:12:10.401 --> 1:12:11.993
[rings doorbell]

1:12:18.242 --> 1:12:21.002
Look who decided to grace us
with her presence.

1:12:21.079 --> 1:12:22.837
Hi, mama.

1:12:33.908 --> 1:12:35.850
Hi, jennifer.

1:12:36.001 --> 1:12:37.810
Hi, david.

1:12:42.934 --> 1:12:44.750
Just drive.

1:12:44.769 --> 1:12:45.693
Go.

1:13:22.306 --> 1:13:25.458
I don't care what you say,
you're wrong.

1:13:25.476 --> 1:13:26.459
My leg is broken.

1:13:26.461 --> 1:13:28.811
I can't put any weight on it.

1:13:28.963 --> 1:13:30.963
Now, I'm gonna need a cast.

1:13:30.982 --> 1:13:33.983

1:13:58.417 --> 1:14:00.268
Is it real?

1:14:00.344 --> 1:14:02.085

1:14:02.105 --> 1:14:03.679
Okay.

1:14:03.831 --> 1:14:05.606
Here we go.

1:14:05.683 --> 1:14:09.852
This case is about money,
murder, and madness.

1:14:10.004 --> 1:14:11.446
The evidence will show

1:14:11.597 --> 1:14:14.615
That a greedy and
manipulative defendant

1:14:14.692 --> 1:14:20.788
Took advantage of a mentally ill
woman who was in love with her.

1:14:20.940 --> 1:14:26.185
A divorce would net
her $500,000.

1:14:26.187 --> 1:14:29.464
But his death netted
her millions.

1:14:29.615 --> 1:14:32.467
<i> Celeste beard needed</i>
<i> tracey tarlton</i>

1:14:32.543 --> 1:14:34.969
<i> To shoot her husband,</i>
<i> steve beard.</i>

1:14:35.046 --> 1:14:37.972
We expect that, when you hear
all the evidence,

1:14:38.123 --> 1:14:41.309
You will agree
that this defendant

1:14:41.460 --> 1:14:45.980
Is guilty of capital murder.

1:14:46.131 --> 1:14:50.209
The state's key witness,
tracey tarlton, is crazy.

1:14:50.228 --> 1:14:53.804
The da can't corroborate
any of her statements

1:14:53.823 --> 1:14:58.326
And there is no evidence
connecting celeste beard

1:14:58.477 --> 1:14:59.977
To this crime.

1:14:59.996 --> 1:15:03.572
This is really a case about
fatal attraction and obsession.

1:15:03.725 --> 1:15:06.726
Tracey couldn't have celeste
all to herself

1:15:06.728 --> 1:15:11.005
So she killed celeste's husband.

1:15:11.082 --> 1:15:14.900
These are the actions of a
delusional, mentally ill woman

1:15:14.919 --> 1:15:19.680
Who cannot keep her
own story straight.

1:15:19.832 --> 1:15:24.760
Of course, tracey tarlton points
the finger at celeste beard.

1:15:24.912 --> 1:15:27.522
<i> She's hoping to lighten</i>
<i> her sentence.</i>

1:15:27.598 --> 1:15:30.191
As for mrs. Beard,

1:15:30.342 --> 1:15:34.754
She married well
when she married steve.

1:15:34.772 --> 1:15:39.867
But they were happy
before his death.

1:15:39.944 --> 1:15:44.872
Steve beard's murder
was a tragic event

1:15:45.024 --> 1:15:51.103
At the hand of tracey tarlton.

1:15:51.122 --> 1:15:53.548
You confessed to shooting
steve beard.

1:15:53.699 --> 1:15:55.866
That is not in question today.

1:15:55.885 --> 1:15:58.611
The matter at hand is why.

1:15:58.613 --> 1:16:03.632
Why did you shoot steve beard,
ms. Tarlton.

1:16:03.785 --> 1:16:06.969
I shot steve because celeste
asked me to.

1:16:07.121 --> 1:16:08.729
<i> She planned everything.</i>

1:16:08.806 --> 1:16:10.565
<i> Which door she would</i>
<i> leave unlocked,</i>

1:16:10.641 --> 1:16:13.901
Her sleeping in the girls' room
that night.

1:16:13.978 --> 1:16:16.128
She even suggested I shoot him
in the stomach

1:16:16.147 --> 1:16:17.905
So the blood splatter
wouldn't mess up

1:16:17.982 --> 1:16:20.149
The paint job on the walls.

1:16:20.301 --> 1:16:23.319
She said she didn't wanna have
to redecorate after he died.

1:16:24.730 --> 1:16:28.416
And just because celeste beard
asked you to shoot her husband,

1:16:28.567 --> 1:16:31.419
Why would you go ahead
and do that?

1:16:34.239 --> 1:16:36.424
Because I loved her.

1:16:39.411 --> 1:16:43.097
I thought that if I shot
steve that...

1:16:43.174 --> 1:16:47.493
We could be together
and celeste would be safe.

1:16:47.511 --> 1:16:51.939
So why turn on
celeste beard now?

1:16:52.016 --> 1:16:54.775
Because I shot an innocent man.

1:16:59.190 --> 1:17:01.616
Because the truth
has to come out

1:17:01.692 --> 1:17:04.285
So that steve's family
can have some closure.

1:17:04.362 --> 1:17:06.603
<i> I have to live with this guilt</i>
<i> the rest of my life,</i>

1:17:06.623 --> 1:17:10.291
<i> But celeste lied to steve</i>
<i> and she lied to me,</i>

1:17:10.368 --> 1:17:13.294
<i> And though I don't think she's</i>
<i> capable of feeling any guilt.</i>

1:17:13.445 --> 1:17:16.021
She has to pay
for what she did.

1:17:16.023 --> 1:17:18.448
No further questions,
your honor.

1:17:18.468 --> 1:17:20.693
Ms. Tarlton, is it fair to say
that you've been suicidal

1:17:20.695 --> 1:17:22.470
Multiple points in your life?

1:17:22.546 --> 1:17:23.787
Yes, sir.

1:17:23.806 --> 1:17:26.974
Is it fair to say that you've
been homicidal?

1:17:27.051 --> 1:17:27.975
Yes, sir.

1:17:28.127 --> 1:17:29.477
What about delusional?

1:17:31.706 --> 1:17:32.980
I don't know.
About what?

1:17:33.132 --> 1:17:34.815
About your relationship
with mrs. Beard.

1:17:34.967 --> 1:17:36.058
The two of you were friends

1:17:36.210 --> 1:17:39.320
But in your mind you were
more than that.

1:17:39.397 --> 1:17:41.489
You thought you were lovers.

1:17:41.640 --> 1:17:43.974
No, that was real.

1:17:43.993 --> 1:17:45.567
We were in love.

1:17:45.720 --> 1:17:49.330
I loved celeste and celeste
said that she loved me too.

1:17:49.481 --> 1:17:53.334
Ms. Tarlton, what is this?

1:17:53.411 --> 1:17:54.410
That's my journal.

1:17:54.562 --> 1:17:56.653
You seem to write
about everything.

1:17:56.673 --> 1:18:00.675
Could you read this passage
to the court?

1:18:00.826 --> 1:18:05.846
It gets so hard to pretend
I have a girlfriend

1:18:05.923 --> 1:18:08.498
Who wants to see me
and spend time with me.

1:18:08.518 --> 1:18:09.499
Pretend?

1:18:09.519 --> 1:18:10.926
Did it get hard pretending

1:18:11.078 --> 1:18:14.021
You were in a relationship
with mrs. Beard?

1:18:14.173 --> 1:18:15.856
I mean, because that's what
you were doing, weren't you?

1:18:15.933 --> 1:18:16.691
Pretending?

1:18:16.842 --> 1:18:18.192
That's not what I meant!

1:18:18.269 --> 1:18:20.027
I was pretty medicated
when I wrote most of this.

1:18:20.179 --> 1:18:21.437
Medicated?

1:18:21.589 --> 1:18:23.605
As in taking medication
for a psychological issue?

1:18:23.758 --> 1:18:26.942
You tell me if this is right.

1:18:27.094 --> 1:18:28.761
Your psychological assessment
from meninger clinic,

1:18:28.779 --> 1:18:31.188
One of the places
that you were treated in,

1:18:31.207 --> 1:18:37.453
They described you as bright,
manipulative, bipolar disorder,

1:18:37.605 --> 1:18:41.215
<i> Inclined to serious, even</i>
<i> delusional misinterpretations</i>

1:18:41.292 --> 1:18:44.868
Of other people and reality.

1:18:44.887 --> 1:18:47.888
Does that sound accurate to you,
ms. Tarlton?

1:18:48.040 --> 1:18:51.133
I need to hear you say it,
ms. Tarlton.

1:18:51.285 --> 1:18:56.230
Your relationship with mrs.
Beard was a delusion, wasn't it?

1:19:00.478 --> 1:19:02.962
I loved you.

1:19:02.980 --> 1:19:05.631
<i> I really did.</i>

1:19:05.649 --> 1:19:08.075
<i> I'm so ashamed</i>
<i> of what I've done.</i>

1:19:08.152 --> 1:19:11.912
<i>I'm sorry for the pain I caused</i>
<i> the beard family.</i>

1:19:12.064 --> 1:19:13.539
<i> I will never forgive myself.</i>

1:19:14.658 --> 1:19:17.493
To answer your question,
mr. Masters,

1:19:17.645 --> 1:19:19.903
I was not delusional.

1:19:19.922 --> 1:19:23.332
I was deluded
by celeste beard.

1:19:23.484 --> 1:19:25.426
<i> Reporters: This is a case</i>
<i> of she said, she said,</i>

1:19:25.577 --> 1:19:28.821
<i>And today we got more questions</i>
<i> than answers.</i>

1:19:28.839 --> 1:19:30.931
<i> Jennifer: He ripped her</i>
<i> to shreds.</i>

1:19:31.083 --> 1:19:32.916
Yet she was telling the truth.

1:19:32.935 --> 1:19:34.676
It doesn't matter.

1:19:34.829 --> 1:19:36.178
He made the jury doubt
her credibility.

1:19:36.330 --> 1:19:38.105
That's enough to discredit
all of it.

1:19:38.182 --> 1:19:39.756
Celeste could walk.

1:19:39.776 --> 1:19:41.500
We can't let that happen.

1:19:41.519 --> 1:19:43.611
Steve really loved us,
didn't he?

1:19:43.762 --> 1:19:47.022
Yes. He did.

1:19:47.174 --> 1:19:49.358
We have to stand up to celeste.

1:19:49.510 --> 1:19:51.860
[phone ringing]

1:19:52.013 --> 1:19:53.954
<i> David: Is that her?</i>

1:19:54.106 --> 1:19:55.623
She just doesn't get it.

1:19:55.774 --> 1:19:58.534
Completely delusional celeste.

1:19:58.686 --> 1:20:00.853
<i> She can't get away with this.</i>

1:20:00.871 --> 1:20:02.129
[phone continues ringing]

1:20:02.206 --> 1:20:03.872
You okay, kristina?

1:20:04.025 --> 1:20:05.524
We have to go to the police.
Now.

1:20:05.543 --> 1:20:06.375
Why?

1:20:06.527 --> 1:20:08.093
Because mom said something.

1:20:12.958 --> 1:20:13.715
Hi.

1:20:13.868 --> 1:20:14.633
Hey.

1:20:15.460 --> 1:20:17.436
Sit tight, we're looking good.

1:20:19.890 --> 1:20:24.276
The prosecution calls to
the stand kristina beard.

1:20:26.656 --> 1:20:27.655
Kristina?

1:20:39.076 --> 1:20:40.668
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

1:20:40.819 --> 1:20:43.987
And nothing but the truth?

1:20:44.006 --> 1:20:45.506
I do.

1:20:51.848 --> 1:20:52.680
<i> You started tape recording</i>
<i> your interactions</i>

1:20:52.756 --> 1:20:53.589
<i> With your mother, correct?</i>

1:20:53.741 --> 1:20:55.090
Yes.

1:20:55.242 --> 1:20:56.517
<i>And why did you start recording</i>
<i> your mother, kristina?</i>

1:20:56.594 --> 1:20:58.243
Because I thought that
if she could hear herself

1:20:58.262 --> 1:21:01.021
On the recording
that she would realize

1:21:01.098 --> 1:21:04.191
How hurtful she was being.

1:21:04.343 --> 1:21:08.195
But then I heard something
I didn't wanna believe.

1:21:08.347 --> 1:21:10.756
Your honor, the prosecution
wishes to introduce

1:21:10.758 --> 1:21:14.201
Into evidence
the following tape.

1:21:14.353 --> 1:21:15.260
Objection!

1:21:15.262 --> 1:21:16.537
Grounds?

1:21:16.614 --> 1:21:19.781
The tape will corroborate
previous testimony.

1:21:19.934 --> 1:21:21.542
I'd like to hear it.

1:21:24.881 --> 1:21:26.121
Hi, mama.

1:21:26.273 --> 1:21:27.773
Hmm.

1:21:27.775 --> 1:21:30.943
Is that all you have
to say to me?

1:21:30.961 --> 1:21:33.554
What about "I'm sorry"?

1:21:33.631 --> 1:21:36.056
You never say no to me, kris.
What's going on with you?

1:21:38.619 --> 1:21:42.062
Where are you staying?
At david's?

1:21:42.214 --> 1:21:43.138
You girls.

1:21:43.290 --> 1:21:45.124
If you want any more of my money

1:21:45.142 --> 1:21:46.901
You better get your
butts home today.

1:21:47.052 --> 1:21:48.293
We're not coming home, mama.

1:21:48.312 --> 1:21:51.313
What did I ever do
that was so wrong?

1:21:51.465 --> 1:21:54.967
Everything I've ever done
has been for you girls.

1:21:54.969 --> 1:21:57.244
The jobs I worked,
marrying steve,

1:21:57.321 --> 1:21:59.747
It's all been just to give you
a better life.

1:22:01.976 --> 1:22:05.494
Now how can you abandon me
like this?

1:22:05.646 --> 1:22:08.147
I don't wanna abandon you, mama,
but you're scaring me.

1:22:08.165 --> 1:22:09.665
Ugh.

1:22:09.817 --> 1:22:12.927
You know I need help, kristina.

1:22:13.003 --> 1:22:18.173
This trial is a little trickier
than I thought.

1:22:18.325 --> 1:22:19.600
<i> Kristina: What do you mean?</i>

1:22:21.495 --> 1:22:23.604
<i> What did you do, mama?</i>

1:22:23.681 --> 1:22:25.514
<i> Celeste: Why don't you go make</i>
<i> your mama another drink?</i>

1:22:25.666 --> 1:22:27.274
<i>Kristina: What did you do, mama?</i>

1:22:27.426 --> 1:22:29.610
<i> Celeste: The police arrested</i>
<i> heather.</i>

1:22:29.687 --> 1:22:31.779
<i> I don't know what she's gonna</i>
<i> say to 'em.</i>

1:22:31.930 --> 1:22:35.115
<i> Kristina: Is this about?</i>
<i> About the check?</i>

1:22:35.267 --> 1:22:36.450
I wrote that check

1:22:36.601 --> 1:22:40.245
So heather could hire someone
to kill tracey.

1:22:41.182 --> 1:22:43.082
[sobs]

1:22:47.521 --> 1:22:49.797
<i> A lot of people believe</i>
<i> that the bible says</i>

1:22:49.948 --> 1:22:53.116
That money is the root
of all evil.

1:22:53.135 --> 1:22:57.137
What the bible actually says
is that the love of money

1:22:57.289 --> 1:22:59.306
Is the root of all evil.

1:22:59.383 --> 1:23:01.791
<i> Celeste beard loved money</i>

1:23:01.811 --> 1:23:05.145
<i> More than she loved anything</i>
<i> or anyone.</i>

1:23:05.297 --> 1:23:07.630
<i> She may not have pulled</i>
<i> the trigger</i>

1:23:07.650 --> 1:23:11.652
<i> But she did orchestrate</i>
<i> her own husband's murder.</i>

1:23:11.729 --> 1:23:16.565
You must find celeste beard
guilty.

1:23:16.717 --> 1:23:19.326
<i> Celeste beard is not a saint,</i>

1:23:19.478 --> 1:23:24.498
But she is a caring person
who picks up strays.

1:23:24.649 --> 1:23:30.412
Tracey tarlton is a stray
celeste thought she could help.

1:23:30.564 --> 1:23:34.508
<i>Celeste did not pull the trigger</i>
<i> that killed steve beard.</i>

1:23:34.585 --> 1:23:37.236
Tracey tarlton shot steve beard

1:23:37.254 --> 1:23:40.088
In a fit of delusion
and selfish fury,

1:23:40.241 --> 1:23:43.666
Wanting to have celeste
to herself.

1:23:43.686 --> 1:23:47.521
She is the real perpetrator
of this crime.

1:23:53.754 --> 1:23:59.424
We the jury find the defendant,
celeste beard,

1:23:59.443 --> 1:24:01.276
Guilty of capital murder.

<i> You say that we betrayed you</i>

But I have done nothing
but try to make you happy.

1:24:38.482 --> 1:24:46.154
I loved you, and steve loved you
and you betrayed him.

1:24:46.307 --> 1:24:49.808
<i>You said you wanted us to have</i>
<i> a family and a nice life.</i>

1:24:52.162 --> 1:24:54.646
<i> You took all of that away.</i>

1:24:54.665 --> 1:24:58.592
You shouldn't get to walk free
in the world when steve doesn't.

<i>I don't think I'll ever forgive</i>
<i> you, mama.</i>

I know my dad would, too.
He really loved you.

Everything kristina
said up there was true.

We really loved steve.

Before steve I never had anyone
who hugged me

Or told me they were
proud of me.

1:25:31.018 --> 1:25:32.017
Oh.
