WEBVTT

00:08.554 --> 00:10.054
We couldn't do this
in my Ready Room?

00:10.263 --> 00:12.389
The captain's gotta be
in the captain's chair.

00:12.597 --> 00:14.433
- Tilt your chin up.
- Just take the picture.

00:16.265 --> 00:18.225
You've got a stanchion
growing out of your head.

00:18.433 --> 00:20.476
Swivel to the right
about 10 degrees.

00:23.979 --> 00:25.688
Every recruit walking into
Starfleet Command

00:25.896 --> 00:27.814
is gonna see this on the wall.

00:28.106 --> 00:29.439
It's a real honour, sir.

00:29.689 --> 00:31.315
Seeing those Starfleet
captains every day

00:31.524 --> 00:33.650
gave us something to aspire to.

00:34.483 --> 00:36.735
There's a reflection
from that status display.

00:36.943 --> 00:39.861
Could you kill the monitors
in the Situation Room?

00:40.320 --> 00:41.613
Come on, T'Pol.

00:41.862 --> 00:44.321
The artist in Oakland needs
a good picture to paint from.

00:44.530 --> 00:48.116
Do Vulcan captains have their portraits
hanging at the High Command?

00:48.491 --> 00:50.742
Vulcans are revered
for their accomplishments,

00:50.951 --> 00:52.451
not for the way they look.

00:52.701 --> 00:56.869
Except for the really important ones,
who get mummified.

00:57.286 --> 01:00.330
Why can't they just
use a photo from my file?

01:00.539 --> 01:04.290
Sir, I'm picking up a small planet
on our current heading.

01:04.958 --> 01:07.376
I thought there weren't
any systems along this course.

01:07.626 --> 01:10.502
It's not a system, captain.
It's just a planet.

01:12.127 --> 01:13.795
Put it up.

01:18.173 --> 01:19.965
Magnify.

01:22.008 --> 01:23.884
It's a rogue.

01:24.384 --> 01:26.802
A planet that's broken
out of its orbit.

01:27.177 --> 01:28.428
Lay in a course.

01:28.636 --> 01:30.721
- Let's take a closer look.
- Aye, sir.

01:31.429 --> 01:33.597
Captain Archer in command.

01:33.847 --> 01:35.973
Give it a rest, Trip.

01:41.976 --> 01:47.313
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

01:49.773 --> 01:53.190
"It's been a long time"

01:53.398 --> 01:57.234
"But my time is finally near"

01:57.443 --> 02:01.695
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

02:01.904 --> 02:04.822
"I will touch the sky"

02:05.031 --> 02:08.823
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

02:09.032 --> 02:12.034
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

02:12.242 --> 02:16.953
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

02:17.162 --> 02:20.079
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

02:20.287 --> 02:24.874
"I've got faith to believe"

02:25.082 --> 02:27.666
"I can do anything"

02:27.875 --> 02:32.378
"I've got strength of the soul"

02:32.586 --> 02:35.462
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

02:35.670 --> 02:41.007
"I can reach any star"

02:41.382 --> 02:45.134
"I've got faith"

02:45.342 --> 02:49.052
"I've got faith"

02:49.261 --> 02:54.055
"Faith of the heart"

02:56.000 --> 03:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:05.111 --> 03:08.313
This planet supports
a diverse animal population.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.355
How is that possible?

03:10.564 --> 03:13.274
Shouldn't the surface be frozen solid?

03:13.607 --> 03:15.733
Hot gas is venting
from the planet's interior.

03:15.941 --> 03:20.110
Most of the life forms
are concentrated in those areas.

03:20.318 --> 03:21.986
Oases.

03:23.195 --> 03:24.904
Any people?

03:27.905 --> 03:29.823
No evidence of humanoid life.

03:30.031 --> 03:32.575
I'm picking up a power signature
near the equator.

03:32.867 --> 03:35.034
There's a ship down there.

03:35.410 --> 03:37.161
Try to hail them.

03:41.038 --> 03:42.872
No response.

03:43.247 --> 03:45.164
Maybe they wanna be left alone.

03:45.707 --> 03:47.791
A single ship on a dark planet.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.959
Maybe they're on their honeymoon.

03:58.630 --> 04:00.172
Infrared's useless.

04:00.381 --> 04:03.550
There's too much heat
coming from those thermal vents.

04:05.801 --> 04:08.136
We should be right over that ship.

04:08.386 --> 04:10.094
I'm scanning for a break
in the canopy.

04:10.302 --> 04:13.096
If this is anything like the Amazon,
good luck.

04:13.304 --> 04:16.389
I used to say I could land
a shuttlepod with my eyes closed.

04:16.639 --> 04:18.932
Well, the proof's
in the pudding, captain.

04:19.975 --> 04:21.809
There's a clearing ahead,
900 metres.

04:22.017 --> 04:24.017
But it's not much bigger
than the shuttlepod.

04:24.309 --> 04:26.060
It doesn't have to be.

04:50.656 --> 04:55.243
Captain, the vessel's that way,
600 metres.

04:55.826 --> 04:57.077
Follow me.

04:57.285 --> 05:00.495
Why don't you let me play captain
for a while, Malcolm.

05:05.288 --> 05:08.123
This reminds me of the rain forest
in New Zealand.

05:08.832 --> 05:11.709
I earned my Wilderness
merit badge there.

05:11.918 --> 05:13.627
You were a Boy Scout, sir?

05:13.835 --> 05:15.336
I was an Eagle Scout.

05:16.671 --> 05:17.836
So was I.

05:18.045 --> 05:19.588
Really?

05:19.921 --> 05:21.422
How many merit badges?

05:21.631 --> 05:24.716
Twenty-eight. You?

05:25.424 --> 05:27.093
Twenty-six.

05:28.176 --> 05:30.093
That's not bad, sir.

05:31.302 --> 05:32.969
Captain.

06:07.988 --> 06:11.907
We spot any more creatures like that
and we'll earn our Exobiology badges.

06:12.115 --> 06:15.950
Actually, I already have that one.

06:30.291 --> 06:32.250
A campsite, sir.

06:33.585 --> 06:35.461
Anyone home?

06:41.421 --> 06:44.214
We're from the starship Enterprise.

06:44.965 --> 06:46.549
Is there anyone here?

06:48.342 --> 06:51.218
I'm still not detecting any bio-signs.

06:51.427 --> 06:54.720
But their ship's less than
200 metres in that direction.

06:56.596 --> 06:58.805
You and Malcolm check it out.

06:59.389 --> 07:03.600
We'll stay here
in case anyone shows up.

07:39.326 --> 07:41.077
Did you hear that?

07:41.536 --> 07:43.120
Yes.

07:52.541 --> 07:54.251
Anything?

07:54.543 --> 07:57.377
For a moment,
I had a humanoid bio-sign.

07:58.169 --> 07:59.878
It's gone.

08:00.587 --> 08:02.337
It's not gone.

08:31.728 --> 08:33.562
Captain, you all right?

08:33.770 --> 08:35.313
Everything's fine.

08:35.522 --> 08:37.147
These are the Eska.

08:37.356 --> 08:39.066
My name is Damrus.

08:39.273 --> 08:43.193
This is T'Pol, my science officer,
and Lieutenant Malcolm Reed.

08:43.567 --> 08:45.276
Pleased to meet you.

08:45.485 --> 08:48.153
Your friends nearly shot me
back there.

08:48.779 --> 08:50.154
We're sorry.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.447
There are dangerous animals
in the forest.

08:52.656 --> 08:55.115
We've never seen
other humanoids here before.

08:55.366 --> 08:57.116
Have we trespassed
in your territory?

08:57.366 --> 08:59.867
This planet is no one's territory.

09:00.076 --> 09:01.868
But it's a special place for us.

09:02.118 --> 09:03.620
What are you doing on Dakala?

09:03.827 --> 09:05.996
We're just here to explore.

09:06.205 --> 09:09.164
We'd like to stay for a while,
if that's all right.

09:14.917 --> 09:16.876
It's a big planet.

09:17.418 --> 09:19.127
We could find another landing site,

09:19.336 --> 09:22.713
but I was hoping
you might enjoy the company.

09:29.424 --> 09:30.966
You aren't exactly roughing it.

09:31.967 --> 09:34.052
Drayjin meat is one of life's
great pleasures.

09:35.261 --> 09:36.678
No argument here.

09:37.804 --> 09:41.055
I'm curious why our sensors
didn't detect you.

09:41.847 --> 09:43.806
We use sensing cloaks.

09:44.015 --> 09:46.183
They keep the wildlife
from spotting us.

09:47.142 --> 09:48.976
Are you studying the wildlife here?

09:50.186 --> 09:51.853
Not exactly.

09:52.770 --> 09:55.729
We're on an expedition.

09:55.937 --> 09:59.565
That Drayjin you're eating,
we killed it yesterday.

10:00.732 --> 10:03.317
- You're hunters.
- Our people have been coming here

10:03.525 --> 10:05.359
for nine generations.

10:05.984 --> 10:08.569
To kill the indigenous species?

10:09.236 --> 10:11.988
Taking wild animals
is part of our tradition.

10:13.197 --> 10:16.157
There are higher primates here.
We don't touch them.

10:18.116 --> 10:22.993
Hunting went out of style on Earth
over a hundred years ago.

10:23.493 --> 10:27.121
That doesn't mean we don't
appreciate your hospitality.

10:27.954 --> 10:29.581
That gear you're carrying.

10:29.789 --> 10:32.957
Seems pretty elaborate
to take down a few game animals.

10:33.207 --> 10:35.666
Don't underestimate
the game on this planet.

10:35.875 --> 10:38.710
They often get the better of us.

10:41.545 --> 10:43.671
I wonder if I might join
one of your hunts.

10:44.963 --> 10:47.213
I thought you people didn't approve.

10:47.422 --> 10:49.632
You were able to sneak up on us

10:49.840 --> 10:53.301
without being detected
by our night-vision sensors.

10:53.509 --> 10:54.968
I'd like to see how you did that.

10:57.469 --> 10:59.221
I promise I won't kill anything, sir.

11:06.974 --> 11:09.726
It's up to our hosts.

11:18.856 --> 11:21.232
Captain's starlog, supplemental.

11:21.441 --> 11:23.817
Trip and Malcolm are bringing
Hoshi back to Enterprise

11:24.025 --> 11:27.986
and putting together some camping
gear to bring back to the surface.

11:28.986 --> 11:31.112
If the bugs glow in the dark,
at least you can tell

11:31.320 --> 11:33.113
when they've
crawled into your sleeping bag.

11:33.321 --> 11:37.490
One more reason I am happy
to spend the night in my own bunk.

11:37.699 --> 11:41.450
Anyway, it's the things you can't see
that I'd be worried about.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.909
Like those bore worms.

11:44.118 --> 11:45.369
Bore worms?

11:45.577 --> 11:49.287
Apparently they crawl into
your ear to lay their eggs.

11:49.663 --> 11:51.747
Have a nice night.

11:55.458 --> 11:58.084
We can start with the entomologists,

11:58.292 --> 12:00.460
then bring the other
bioscience teams down.

12:00.669 --> 12:03.003
I'd recommend we limit the number
of crewmen on the surface

12:03.212 --> 12:05.171
to six at a time.

12:05.380 --> 12:08.756
- Sensible.
- Enjoying yourselves?

12:09.006 --> 12:10.674
Very much.

12:10.881 --> 12:12.800
Thanks for sharing
your camp with us.

12:13.008 --> 12:16.218
We're heading out in six hours.
I suggest you get some sleep,

12:16.426 --> 12:20.388
- if you're still planning to come along.
- I wouldn't miss it.

12:21.054 --> 12:23.262
- Good night.
- Good night.

12:23.471 --> 12:24.931
Night.

12:27.391 --> 12:29.558
I suppose I'll turn in, then.

12:30.642 --> 12:32.936
Sounds like a good idea.

12:34.812 --> 12:37.145
I think I'll sit up for a while.

12:37.354 --> 12:40.189
- Have fun.
- Yeah.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.195
Jonathan.

12:56.948 --> 12:58.782
Jonathan.

13:04.118 --> 13:05.951
Hello?

13:18.374 --> 13:19.917
Is someone there?

13:20.125 --> 13:22.044
Jonathan.

14:08.401 --> 14:10.068
Who's there?

14:56.091 --> 14:57.968
If the captain says he saw her,
he saw her.

14:58.176 --> 14:59.844
Are there any others
in your hunting party?

15:00.052 --> 15:01.303
No.

15:01.511 --> 15:03.846
Certainly no human females.

15:04.054 --> 15:05.680
You sure she wasn't
from your vessel?

15:05.888 --> 15:07.682
I'm sure.

15:09.223 --> 15:11.141
- Archer.
- Mayweather here, captain.

15:11.349 --> 15:14.435
There are no other ships,
on the surface or in orbit.

15:14.643 --> 15:17.437
Thanks, Travis. Archer out.

15:24.606 --> 15:26.232
Nothing.

15:30.484 --> 15:34.153
She was young.
Long blond hair.

15:34.404 --> 15:38.571
She was wearing
some kind of a nightgown.

15:39.280 --> 15:41.323
A nightgown, sir?

15:41.991 --> 15:43.491
Perhaps you were dreaming.

15:43.700 --> 15:45.951
It wasn't a dream.

15:46.284 --> 15:48.744
She said my name.
She knew who I was.

15:48.953 --> 15:50.411
And...

15:52.662 --> 15:55.372
- I think I knew her.
- Sir?

15:55.914 --> 15:58.165
There was something about her.
L...

15:59.958 --> 16:01.793
I've seen her before.

16:02.501 --> 16:04.460
On this planet...

16:05.043 --> 16:07.169
...it's always night.

16:07.711 --> 16:10.964
You're surrounded by things
you can hear, but not see.

16:11.172 --> 16:12.965
It can...

16:13.757 --> 16:15.341
...stimulate the imagination.

16:15.549 --> 16:17.883
You wouldn't be the first person
who looked into the jungle

16:18.092 --> 16:19.467
and saw something
that wasn't there.

16:19.717 --> 16:23.136
- She was real.
- Captain Archer...

16:23.387 --> 16:26.180
...what are the chances you'd
encounter a half-naked woman,

16:26.389 --> 16:27.764
who you think you know,

16:27.972 --> 16:31.057
dozens of light years
from your home world?

16:33.642 --> 16:35.434
Go to sleep.

16:36.726 --> 16:40.354
If you're lucky, maybe
she'll visit you in your dreams.

16:50.025 --> 16:51.817
These can detect infrared.

16:52.026 --> 16:53.819
Among other things.

16:54.027 --> 16:55.278
What are you going after today?

16:55.487 --> 16:57.613
We saw a pack
of fire wolves yesterday

16:57.820 --> 17:01.239
about six kilometres from here.

17:01.614 --> 17:03.115
It's a difficult hike.

17:03.324 --> 17:05.367
I'll try to keep up.

17:06.282 --> 17:08.701
We'd appreciate it.
We only have two days left.

17:08.910 --> 17:10.161
What's the hurry?

17:10.368 --> 17:13.078
To preserve Dakala, our law states
that we're allowed to hunt here

17:13.287 --> 17:15.497
for four days each year.
Then we have to leave.

17:15.704 --> 17:18.664
Hunters often wait decades
for a chance to come here.

17:18.873 --> 17:20.540
Are those volcanic vents?

17:20.750 --> 17:23.167
Yes, that area's particularly active.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.376
Mineral springs, steam vents.
It's quite spectacular.

17:26.585 --> 17:29.420
Could be worth checking out
while Malcolm's on his safari.

17:29.629 --> 17:31.630
I'll get my camera.

17:31.838 --> 17:33.714
Did you sleep well, captain?

17:33.922 --> 17:35.299
Yes, fine.

17:35.507 --> 17:37.008
Good.

17:37.216 --> 17:40.967
If you see any beautiful females today,
you'll be sure to let us know.

18:10.774 --> 18:13.109
Drayjin, a female.

18:13.318 --> 18:15.652
They're very unpredictable.

18:34.704 --> 18:37.122
Reminds me of Yellowstone.

18:39.039 --> 18:42.165
It's more like the grottoes
of Deneva Prime.

18:51.796 --> 18:55.256
I'm detecting a large geothermal
shaft 60 metres in that direction.

18:55.464 --> 18:57.674
I'd like to examine it.

18:58.842 --> 19:00.509
Sir?

19:03.927 --> 19:05.928
Permission granted.

19:06.387 --> 19:08.304
Stay in contact.

19:13.975 --> 19:15.641
So...

19:18.142 --> 19:20.519
...she was wearing a nightgown?

19:21.644 --> 19:23.187
You think she's real.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.021
I wasn't hallucinating.

19:25.230 --> 19:26.772
Captain...

19:27.022 --> 19:29.147
...it doesn't make any sense.
- I know.

19:29.356 --> 19:30.607
Trip...

19:30.816 --> 19:33.609
...have you ever known me
to do anything foolish? I mean,

19:33.818 --> 19:35.443
really foolish?

19:36.027 --> 19:39.362
I remember a poker game at Jupiter
Station once. Other than that...

19:39.612 --> 19:43.489
Last night I walked into
an alien jungle, alone,

19:43.697 --> 19:47.449
chasing a woman who couldn't
possibly have been there.

19:47.741 --> 19:48.991
That might qualify.

19:50.743 --> 19:53.953
It was like I was being drawn to her.

19:54.203 --> 19:56.829
Like I didn't have any control
over what I was doing.

19:57.037 --> 19:58.372
I can't explain it.

20:00.414 --> 20:02.457
She must've been some woman.

20:37.392 --> 20:39.851
- Wraith!
- What is it?

20:40.060 --> 20:43.061
- Is there something out there?
- It could be a plume of steam.

20:43.269 --> 20:45.146
They can fool our thermal scanners.

20:45.354 --> 20:46.855
Well, let's find out.

20:47.064 --> 20:49.440
No point in all of us
chasing a sensor ghost.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.482
- You two stay on the trail.
- Damrus.

20:51.690 --> 20:53.608
Take care of our guest.

20:53.816 --> 20:55.609
We'll catch up.

22:16.192 --> 22:17.901
Jonathan.

22:20.862 --> 22:22.446
Who are you?

22:35.619 --> 22:37.245
How do you know my name?

22:38.871 --> 22:42.539
I need you, Jonathan.

22:44.873 --> 22:46.541
You're speaking English.

22:47.125 --> 22:49.835
I need you to understand.

22:50.751 --> 22:52.670
I know you.

22:54.129 --> 22:55.712
How is that possible?

22:56.170 --> 22:59.548
If you didn't know me,
would you have come?

23:01.632 --> 23:04.676
You said you needed me. Why?

23:05.843 --> 23:07.386
You're different.

23:08.010 --> 23:09.761
Different?

23:16.807 --> 23:18.391
What is it?

23:32.315 --> 23:35.149
- What's wrong?
- Harm.

23:35.650 --> 23:38.401
- I don't wanna harm you.
- Not Jonathan.

23:38.651 --> 23:40.026
Then who?

23:40.235 --> 23:41.611
Who wants to harm you?

23:42.028 --> 23:43.487
Captain?

23:47.281 --> 23:49.032
Are you all right?

23:51.366 --> 23:52.950
Fine.

23:53.617 --> 23:55.701
You disappeared on us.

23:56.202 --> 23:58.411
What are you doing out here?

24:00.829 --> 24:02.538
Just...

24:04.498 --> 24:06.998
...taking some scans.

24:46.353 --> 24:47.686
- Hold him!
- I'm trying.

24:47.895 --> 24:50.229
- If you can't keep him steady...
- You're going to be fine,

24:50.438 --> 24:51.938
but you have to be still.

24:52.147 --> 24:53.773
- Archer to Enterprise.
- What did that?

24:53.981 --> 24:55.316
- I didn't see it.
- Go ahead, sir.

24:55.524 --> 24:58.318
- We split off to follow another trail.
- Tell Dr Phlox to stand by.

24:58.525 --> 24:59.859
- Yes, sir.
- It was a Drayjin.

25:00.068 --> 25:02.402
The females can be aggressive
if they're protecting a nest.

25:02.611 --> 25:04.236
The wound's deep.
Give me the bonding kit!

25:04.445 --> 25:07.363
There's no internal damage,
but he's lost a great deal of blood.

25:07.572 --> 25:10.741
We've got a doctor on board our ship.
I've alerted him to stand by.

25:10.990 --> 25:12.699
We're prepared to deal
with injuries here.

25:12.908 --> 25:14.909
We need him for the hunt.
Their doctor can help.

25:15.117 --> 25:17.368
We only have two more days.

25:18.328 --> 25:21.537
Thank you, captain. Obviously, we
want him to have the best treatment.

25:21.746 --> 25:24.998
Let's get him back to the shuttlepod.
You and Malcolm go with him.

25:27.290 --> 25:29.750
You should all return to your ship.

25:30.083 --> 25:32.460
We came to this planet
aware of its dangers.

25:32.668 --> 25:36.128
- You didn't.
- I'm not ready to leave.

25:43.590 --> 25:47.259
Lieutenant Reed reports
they've docked with Enterprise.

25:47.468 --> 25:49.302
Thanks.

25:49.510 --> 25:51.052
T'Pol?

25:54.345 --> 25:56.096
Come in.

26:05.768 --> 26:07.685
I saw her again.

26:09.562 --> 26:11.980
Near the thermal vents.

26:13.564 --> 26:15.440
She spoke to me.

26:16.691 --> 26:17.941
What did she say?

26:18.150 --> 26:19.984
She said she...

26:22.401 --> 26:24.194
...needed me.

26:25.445 --> 26:29.114
I think someone
may be trying to hurt her.

26:31.657 --> 26:35.533
I believe you should reconsider
returning to Enterprise.

26:37.076 --> 26:39.077
And have Dr Phlox
take a look at me?

26:43.329 --> 26:46.665
There are no psychotropic
compounds here.

26:47.164 --> 26:50.582
I wasn't hallucinating,
and I wasn't dreaming.

26:51.041 --> 26:55.502
So the only logical conclusion
is that she is a real human woman?

26:58.379 --> 27:01.589
I don't know what she is.

27:01.839 --> 27:03.923
I know it's not possible
for her to be human,

27:04.132 --> 27:06.550
but she's appearing to me
for a reason.

27:06.757 --> 27:09.175
And I'm going to figure out
what it is.

27:09.425 --> 27:11.177
How?

27:11.511 --> 27:12.970
I'm going to find her.

27:15.054 --> 27:16.637
- I'll go with you.
- No.

27:18.222 --> 27:20.431
A well-armed hunter
was nearly killed today.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.225
It would be foolish
to go into the jungle alone.

27:25.601 --> 27:27.352
I have to.

27:29.228 --> 27:32.437
She's chosen
to communicate with me.

27:32.896 --> 27:34.814
I don't know why.

27:36.356 --> 27:40.651
But I don't think she'd reveal herself
if anyone else was around.

27:42.026 --> 27:44.485
Is that your only reason
for going by yourself?

27:45.152 --> 27:47.821
- What?
- With respect, captain,

27:48.029 --> 27:51.572
I wonder if you would be so
determined to find this apparition

27:51.781 --> 27:54.199
if it were a scantily clad man.

28:07.623 --> 28:08.873
How's he doing, doc?

28:09.082 --> 28:12.333
It was a simple matter to synthesize
his blood type for a transfusion.

28:12.541 --> 28:15.251
He'll be back on his feet
in a few hours.

28:16.710 --> 28:18.252
I'll let the captain know.

28:18.461 --> 28:22.255
Commander, could you tell me
what attacked him?

28:22.464 --> 28:27.257
They call it a Drayjin.
Looks like a big, nasty pig.

28:27.466 --> 28:29.258
Kind of tastes like one too.

28:29.467 --> 28:33.594
I found cellular residue in the wound.
It doesn't belong to this gentleman.

28:33.802 --> 28:37.221
I assume it must have come
from the animal that mauled him.

28:39.055 --> 28:40.430
What am I looking at?

28:40.639 --> 28:45.308
The cells are in a state of
chromosomal flux. They're mutating.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.143
It's as if they're trying
to change into something,

28:48.352 --> 28:51.103
but can't quite figure out what.

28:51.520 --> 28:54.688
That must have been
a most unusual pig.

29:00.232 --> 29:01.859
Hello.

29:09.196 --> 29:10.988
Are you there?

29:42.796 --> 29:44.547
I'm alone.

29:51.259 --> 29:53.218
Jonathan.

29:53.468 --> 29:55.511
You're not a hallucination.

29:56.178 --> 29:59.847
You're real. I can touch you.

30:00.555 --> 30:02.431
Real, yes.

30:03.181 --> 30:07.267
But you're not human, are you?

30:08.143 --> 30:11.145
- Human?
- Human.

30:12.186 --> 30:13.979
Like me.

30:14.645 --> 30:16.813
We are not like you.

30:18.189 --> 30:19.648
We?

30:21.732 --> 30:23.650
There are more of you? Where?

30:23.859 --> 30:26.026
I haven't seen others.

30:26.235 --> 30:28.569
We can become whatever you see.

30:28.777 --> 30:33.197
A tree, an animal, water.
Whatever you see.

30:35.615 --> 30:38.033
I see a beautiful woman.

30:39.284 --> 30:41.742
Because you want to see
a beautiful woman.

30:41.993 --> 30:43.576
How do you know what I want?

30:53.499 --> 30:55.707
I can see your thoughts.

30:56.708 --> 30:58.668
I see what eludes you.

30:59.377 --> 31:01.378
You're telepathic.

31:01.586 --> 31:03.212
That's how you know my language.

31:03.671 --> 31:05.755
I know more than your language.

31:06.005 --> 31:09.507
Then you must know
why I'm so drawn to you.

31:09.715 --> 31:12.342
Why I feel like I know you.

31:13.050 --> 31:14.593
You do know me.

31:15.177 --> 31:16.970
From where?

31:20.930 --> 31:23.222
Why did you choose me?

31:24.598 --> 31:25.973
You're different.

31:26.265 --> 31:28.558
You said that before. How?

31:28.767 --> 31:30.142
Who am I different from?

31:30.559 --> 31:31.811
The others.

31:32.019 --> 31:35.896
The only ones who have ever
come here. Before you.

31:36.230 --> 31:37.479
You mean the Eska.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.481
Do you know why they come?

31:40.523 --> 31:43.691
- To hunt.
- To hunt us, Jonathan.

31:43.900 --> 31:47.443
We are what they prize
above all else.

31:54.905 --> 31:56.698
You lost the Drayjin,

31:56.907 --> 31:58.824
but at least you got
some scars to show for it.

31:59.033 --> 32:01.534
Well, thanks to your doctor,
I don't even have that.

32:01.743 --> 32:04.327
To the captain
and his fine physician.

32:04.534 --> 32:05.994
It was no problem, really.

32:06.203 --> 32:09.788
Well, we have to drink to something,
since we came back empty-handed.

32:11.331 --> 32:12.956
To...

32:13.540 --> 32:15.583
...good hunting tomorrow.
- Cheers.

32:15.792 --> 32:18.083
- Good hunting.
- Good hunting.

32:19.501 --> 32:21.668
So how did you lose them?

32:22.503 --> 32:24.462
Drayjin are migratory.

32:24.670 --> 32:27.214
By the time we got back,
they moved on.

32:27.422 --> 32:31.050
All those imaging sensors,
and you couldn't see where they went?

32:31.300 --> 32:33.675
They're more elusive
than you give them credit for.

32:34.467 --> 32:36.218
Apparently.

32:36.635 --> 32:38.261
Do you hunt on your own world?

32:38.803 --> 32:40.137
Yes.

32:42.305 --> 32:44.931
Then why travel light years
to hunt here?

32:45.723 --> 32:48.600
Seems like a long way to come
just to shoot a few wild pigs.

32:48.849 --> 32:51.309
We hunt more than wild pigs.

32:54.019 --> 32:55.937
The prey here is different.

32:57.062 --> 33:01.898
Boar, wolves, some large reptiles.

33:02.106 --> 33:04.357
It doesn't seem that different.

33:06.400 --> 33:09.903
Imagine hunting something
that can get inside your mind...

33:10.111 --> 33:12.029
...sense your thoughts.

33:12.279 --> 33:13.737
Is that different enough?

33:15.530 --> 33:17.573
What are you talking about?

33:17.990 --> 33:19.699
Wraiths.

33:20.450 --> 33:21.867
You mean ghosts?

33:22.200 --> 33:23.784
They might as well be.

33:25.952 --> 33:29.829
Come on, fellas.
That seems pretty far-fetched.

33:30.329 --> 33:31.872
Does it?

33:32.247 --> 33:33.789
You saw one yourself.

33:34.206 --> 33:35.498
Your mystery woman.

33:36.040 --> 33:39.001
She was undoubtedly a wraith
who wandered too close to camp.

33:39.835 --> 33:41.084
But she looked human.

33:42.169 --> 33:44.169
You don't even know if it was a she.

33:44.837 --> 33:46.671
They're shape-shifters.

33:46.880 --> 33:48.171
They can look like anything.

33:48.839 --> 33:50.673
Even people you know.

33:52.091 --> 33:54.216
That's how they trick you.

33:54.800 --> 33:57.593
They sound like intelligent,
sentient beings.

33:57.843 --> 34:00.053
Not the way you or I
would measure intelligence.

34:00.261 --> 34:02.054
It's an instinctual response.

34:02.304 --> 34:04.389
That's why we were tracking you
the day you arrived.

34:04.597 --> 34:05.973
We thought they'd taken your form.

34:06.223 --> 34:09.808
They assume the exact characteristics
of whatever they become.

34:10.014 --> 34:13.351
They turn into a rock,
all you see is a rock.

34:13.560 --> 34:14.811
Even on scanners.

34:15.060 --> 34:17.312
Before we learned
how to spot them,

34:17.520 --> 34:20.313
they killed more of us
than we did of them.

34:21.981 --> 34:25.023
My father came here
with eight other hunters.

34:25.524 --> 34:28.400
They drove a group of wraiths
into a blind canyon.

34:28.609 --> 34:31.860
My father was sure
that they had them cut off.

34:32.360 --> 34:34.362
But when they moved in...

34:35.529 --> 34:37.530
...the wraiths were waiting.

34:40.156 --> 34:42.116
They'd read the hunters' minds.

34:44.492 --> 34:46.411
They knew their plan.

34:49.994 --> 34:52.161
My father made it out.

34:52.746 --> 34:55.540
But only two of his friends survived.

35:10.381 --> 35:11.881
How do you catch them?

35:12.257 --> 35:13.800
In recent years,

35:14.007 --> 35:17.550
we learned when you
corner them, they panic.

35:17.759 --> 35:19.176
Especially the young ones.

35:22.970 --> 35:26.305
When they're afraid,
they emit a chemical signature.

35:26.514 --> 35:28.723
Our scanners have been
modified to detect it.

35:30.057 --> 35:32.266
It gives us an advantage.

35:42.272 --> 35:44.272
They know damn well
what they're doing.

35:44.481 --> 35:47.399
I find this as distasteful
as you do, captain.

35:47.608 --> 35:49.776
I'm just not sure
how we can stop them.

35:49.984 --> 35:52.277
They're well-armed
and they know the terrain.

35:52.486 --> 35:54.695
I wouldn't want to try and take
their weapons from them.

35:54.904 --> 35:56.571
We have no right to, in any case.

35:56.780 --> 35:59.364
What right do they have to come
to this planet and shoot the locals?

35:59.572 --> 36:02.407
Hunting wild boar is one thing,
but they're killing a sentient species.

36:02.616 --> 36:04.658
Even if we stop them...

36:04.867 --> 36:07.494
...their people will continue
to come here and hunt.

36:07.702 --> 36:09.286
They've done it
for hundreds of years.

36:09.495 --> 36:11.953
Unless we find
a more permanent solution.

36:12.162 --> 36:13.412
Captain?

36:13.621 --> 36:14.997
The hunters said the shape-shifters

36:15.206 --> 36:17.415
emit a chemical signature
when they're afraid.

36:17.624 --> 36:19.291
That's what gives them away.

36:19.500 --> 36:20.875
You have a sample of their cells.

36:21.083 --> 36:23.543
I've been analyzing their
mutative ability. Quite remarkable.

36:23.752 --> 36:26.169
Can you find a way
to mask that chemical?

36:26.377 --> 36:28.420
That would shield them
from the hunters' scans.

36:28.629 --> 36:29.880
I'll start right away.

36:30.088 --> 36:32.714
We may not be able to stop them
from hunting here,

36:32.922 --> 36:35.299
but we could level the playing field.

36:43.720 --> 36:45.512
- Evening, captain.
- Trip.

36:45.721 --> 36:47.014
Get you anything?

36:47.638 --> 36:49.307
No, thanks.

36:51.683 --> 36:53.683
Milk, cold.

36:54.975 --> 36:56.518
Do you know any poetry?

36:57.560 --> 36:59.895
You mean besides "There Was
a Young Lady From lpswich"?

37:01.771 --> 37:03.731
When I was a kid,
if I had trouble sleeping,

37:03.939 --> 37:06.398
my mother
would recite a poem to me.

37:06.607 --> 37:08.608
There was one I always asked for.

37:08.816 --> 37:10.734
It had a funny name.

37:10.942 --> 37:14.069
"The Song of the Wandering Aengus."

37:15.194 --> 37:18.447
I didn't learn till I was older
that it was by Yeats.

37:19.322 --> 37:22.573
I went out to the hazel wood,

37:23.032 --> 37:25.575
Because a fire was in my head,

37:27.576 --> 37:29.119
Anyway...

37:29.368 --> 37:32.704
...the man in the poem catches a fish

37:32.912 --> 37:35.955
and it turns into a beautiful woman...

37:36.455 --> 37:39.206
...with apple blossoms in her hair.

37:39.748 --> 37:44.459
She calls his name
and then vanishes.

37:47.544 --> 37:49.295
And?

37:49.545 --> 37:52.338
He spends the rest of his life
searching for her.

37:54.172 --> 37:58.759
His vision of perfection, I suppose.

37:58.967 --> 38:01.718
Something he could never quite find.

38:03.885 --> 38:05.178
It's her.

38:06.595 --> 38:09.556
- Captain.
- When I listened to the poem,

38:09.764 --> 38:13.766
I must have created an image
of that woman in my mind.

38:14.142 --> 38:15.684
I haven't thought about it in years.

38:15.892 --> 38:19.602
That's why I didn't recognize her at
first. She isn't someone I ever knew.

38:19.811 --> 38:23.021
She's someone I imagined as a child.

38:23.272 --> 38:25.273
The elusive woman from the poem.

38:27.816 --> 38:30.899
Why do you think this shape-shifter

38:31.108 --> 38:34.110
reached into your mind and picked
an image you'd almost forgotten?

38:34.443 --> 38:36.403
I don't know.

38:38.154 --> 38:40.947
Maybe that poem's been
on your mind more than you realize.

38:41.656 --> 38:43.447
Phlox to Captain Archer.

38:45.698 --> 38:46.950
- Archer.
- Captain,

38:47.158 --> 38:48.992
I may have found something.

38:49.201 --> 38:51.119
I'll be right there.

38:53.203 --> 38:56.913
She may just be something
I envisioned a long time ago.

38:59.289 --> 39:01.457
But I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let anyone shoot her.

39:16.256 --> 39:18.216
- Are you sure?
- It's a wraith.

39:18.424 --> 39:20.050
I'm not picking up a signature.

39:20.258 --> 39:22.885
- It was probably just a Drayjin.
- I saw it shift. It's a wraith.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.844
Stay with it.

39:36.851 --> 39:38.392
Where is it?

39:38.809 --> 39:40.227
I'm not picking up anything.

39:40.602 --> 39:42.686
It has to be here.
There's no way out.

39:42.937 --> 39:45.563
Well, if it's cornered,
it must be terrified.

39:45.772 --> 39:48.065
Why can't we detect it?

39:49.107 --> 39:53.275
It may not be afraid now,
but it's about to be.

40:09.492 --> 40:11.494
- I'm all right.
- We should've seen it.

40:11.701 --> 40:14.495
- Maybe our scanners aren't working.
- All of them?

40:23.207 --> 40:24.750
We need to leave.

40:26.084 --> 40:28.085
Let's get back to camp.

40:41.176 --> 40:43.510
How was the hunt? Any luck?

40:44.552 --> 40:46.011
What are you doing here?

40:46.260 --> 40:49.220
We wanted to take a few more
scans before we left.

40:49.971 --> 40:52.514
- Is everything all right?
- We're fine.

40:52.848 --> 40:54.432
You sure?

40:55.266 --> 40:57.225
You look pretty rattled.

40:57.809 --> 41:00.059
Our scanners are malfunctioning.

41:00.268 --> 41:01.727
I'm sorry to hear it.

41:02.185 --> 41:05.354
Looks like you won't be taking home
any trophies this year.

41:11.274 --> 41:13.109
Strange...

41:14.275 --> 41:17.193
...but we never failed in the hunt
before you arrived.

41:21.654 --> 41:24.239
I guess we must be bad luck.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.038
Are you there?

41:41.247 --> 41:42.872
Yes.

41:49.877 --> 41:51.628
They're gone.

41:52.379 --> 41:54.088
For now.

41:57.089 --> 41:59.966
Did you give the others
the masking agent?

42:01.216 --> 42:02.883
Yes.

42:03.509 --> 42:04.926
It'll keep you safe.

42:05.552 --> 42:06.886
Thank you.

42:13.347 --> 42:15.265
I know who you are.

42:17.391 --> 42:18.934
You remembered.

42:19.934 --> 42:21.519
Thank you...

42:22.184 --> 42:23.686
...for reminding me.

42:24.520 --> 42:28.480
Never stop seeking
what seems unobtainable.

42:36.609 --> 42:38.026
Goodbye, Jonathan.

42:42.529 --> 42:44.666
Don't forget me.

43:17.644 --> 43:19.255
I won't.
