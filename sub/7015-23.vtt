WEBVTT

00:06.095 --> 00:07.727
That's funny, Eric.

00:07.871 --> 00:10.711
I thought I told you to
clean out the Vista Cruiser.

00:10.735 --> 00:14.199
But what I must've said
was, "go sit on your ass."

00:15.117 --> 00:18.604
No, I was there, Red. You definitely
said, "Go clean out the Cruiser."

00:19.297 --> 00:22.596
But he just insists
on being defiant.

00:23.418 --> 00:26.414
Look, I'm sorry, dad, but
something really important came up.

00:26.942 --> 00:30.500
"I dream of Jeannie" did her blinking thing,
and now Dr. Bellows thinks he's a monkey, so...

00:31.909 --> 00:37.607
No. Dr. Bellows is a monkey that thinks
he's a doctor. That's what's funny.

00:38.053 --> 00:41.928
He's sittin' at the desk
and stuff. But he's a monkey.

00:42.503 --> 00:43.947
You're a monkey.

00:44.610 --> 00:46.342
You're a monkey.

00:47.060 --> 00:50.533
Eric, I need that car to go
pick up Charlie at the airport.

00:50.653 --> 00:52.257
You're bringing
another guy here?

00:52.273 --> 00:56.031
We need another guy here like I need
another firecracker in my bathing suit.

00:57.041 --> 01:01.233
Well, until you learn to stop wearin' speedos,
you're gonna keep gettin' firecrackers.

01:03.123 --> 01:05.096
Charlie's this
annoyingly nice kid.

01:05.131 --> 01:07.808
His dad and my dad were
drinking buddies in the navy.

01:07.844 --> 01:09.775
We weren't drinking buddies.

01:09.798 --> 01:12.968
We were finely honed
killing buddies.

01:13.779 --> 01:15.516
Yeah, well, I
never liked him.

01:15.552 --> 01:18.638
At the last navy picnic, we
got teamed up for the egg toss.

01:18.673 --> 01:23.640
And he dropped our egg on purpose just
so these little sick kids could win.

01:25.186 --> 01:29.577
Those little twerps went home with my
goldfish-in-a-bag. My goldfish-in-a-bag.

01:30.881 --> 01:33.945
Yeah, well, Charlie's only gonna be
here a few days on business for his dad,

01:33.981 --> 01:37.538
and the last thing he needs is
to be exposed to you deviants.

01:37.574 --> 01:40.110
Whoa, dad, we
are not deviants.

01:40.663 --> 01:42.741
Jeannie's bending over!

01:43.856 --> 01:45.113
Let's go.

01:47.426 --> 01:48.213
Um,

01:48.682 --> 01:52.288
you guys, I gotta talk to Steven
about something really serious.

01:53.744 --> 01:55.282
Maybe she's pregnant!

01:55.564 --> 01:56.680
Maybe she cheated on him.

01:56.703 --> 01:59.169
Maybe she cheated on
him and she's pregnant.

02:01.212 --> 02:01.834
Oh.

02:04.210 --> 02:05.243
Steven,

02:05.454 --> 02:09.187
this TV producer called to tell
me he loved my public access show.

02:09.576 --> 02:14.004
And then he offered me a job at his
station in Chicago starting next week.

02:15.507 --> 02:17.045
Whoa. Um,

02:17.080 --> 02:19.511
you're gonna take a job
and move to Chicago?

02:19.534 --> 02:22.845
No, no, not yet. No, I wanted
to talk to you about it first.

02:22.880 --> 02:23.925
Uh-oh.

02:26.391 --> 02:29.808
This is "serious"
serious, not funny serious.

02:30.242 --> 02:31.687
We should probably leave.

02:32.802 --> 02:34.023
But we won't.

02:36.167 --> 02:38.492
Steven, this is
my dream come true.

02:38.515 --> 02:41.709
But you are the most important
thing in the world to me.

02:42.519 --> 02:45.619
So I'm willing to give it
all up and stay here with you.

02:45.877 --> 02:47.543
But if I do that,

02:48.400 --> 02:50.502
I need to know we're
gonna get married.

02:51.782 --> 02:55.692
Jackie, we just agreed not
to talk about our future.

02:55.727 --> 02:58.267
But our future is
happening right now.

02:59.218 --> 03:02.341
Look, the station needs an answer
by noon on sunday, and I do, too.

03:02.811 --> 03:04.983
Well, I don't know
what to say right now.

03:05.476 --> 03:08.435
I know this is a
sensitive moment,

03:09.844 --> 03:12.885
but may I offer
a word of advice?

03:13.834 --> 03:14.774
Run!

04:04.552 --> 04:06.478
Eric, you remember Charlie.

04:06.654 --> 04:10.223
Well, I remember a
perfectly tossed egg from me,

04:10.434 --> 04:12.900
an unconvincing
"whoops" from him,

04:13.382 --> 04:17.902
and the sound of laughter as some children
ran away with my goldfish-in-a-bag.

04:18.877 --> 04:23.148
Eric, you put some kind of spin on that
egg. It was uncatchable, like a curveball.

04:23.183 --> 04:23.958
Ha!

04:24.275 --> 04:26.753
Your whole story's
unraveling, man.

04:26.976 --> 04:29.477
I can't throw a curveball.

04:30.626 --> 04:32.423
Dad... tell him.

04:33.268 --> 04:35.628
I'm gonna have to side
with my son on this one.

04:35.757 --> 04:37.706
He can't even throw
a straight ball.

04:40.264 --> 04:41.380
Charlie,

04:41.908 --> 04:48.742
I made you a pancake smiley face with sausage
arms and a little scrambled egg cardigan.

04:50.841 --> 04:52.637
Where's my
whimsical breakfast?

04:52.672 --> 04:57.263
Oh, well, since you decided to go
teach in Africa without consulting me,

04:57.310 --> 05:01.511
all you get is a
plain pancake breakfast

05:01.535 --> 05:04.928
with nothing smiling
at you. Nothing.

05:06.781 --> 05:08.648
- Morning.
- Hey, I smell bacon.

05:08.671 --> 05:10.350
Hey, boys. Have
you met Charlie?

05:10.391 --> 05:14.230
Oh, hey, I'm Kelso. I'm
gonna eat your breakfast.

05:15.033 --> 05:18.638
And I'm Fez, and just so you know,
I'm the coolest guy in this gang.

05:19.530 --> 05:21.021
All right, I
gotta go to work.

05:21.057 --> 05:24.225
Charlie, if Eric and his
friends start to bother you,

05:24.260 --> 05:26.984
just hold up a book. It's
like kryptonite to them.

05:29.286 --> 05:30.049
Oh,

05:30.410 --> 05:31.584
hey, Donna.

05:31.666 --> 05:33.944
Are you still mad about
this whole Africa thing?

05:33.979 --> 05:34.801
Yep,

05:34.954 --> 05:39.322
but instead of pouting at my house and being miserable,
I decided to come here and make you miserable.

05:39.886 --> 05:41.908
That's the spirit, Donna.

05:42.718 --> 05:44.702
Here. Eat his bacon.

05:44.737 --> 05:46.557
- Mmm.
- You made me bacon?

05:46.575 --> 05:50.219
Yep. I just kept it
over here in America.

05:51.898 --> 05:53.765
Mmm. Bacon.

05:55.479 --> 05:57.464
Wow. Who is she?

05:58.027 --> 06:00.248
Don't even think about it.

06:00.377 --> 06:03.324
Donna is with Eric,
and then she's mine.

06:04.850 --> 06:06.412
And then she is mine.

06:06.917 --> 06:09.688
And then, right back to
me for another go-around.

06:17.946 --> 06:19.848
Hey, Hyde, I
heard about Jackie.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.551
What are you gonna do?

06:21.774 --> 06:22.572
Well,

06:23.112 --> 06:26.752
I spent all morning kickin' back
with my stash to see what came to me.

06:28.976 --> 06:31.805
But all that came to me
was a great idea for a movie

06:31.841 --> 06:33.684
that now I just
can't remember.

06:34.494 --> 06:36.326
Is that what
that smell was?

06:36.760 --> 06:38.662
Aren't you afraid
you'll get arrested?

06:38.768 --> 06:39.946
I'm a cop.

06:41.027 --> 06:42.976
You guys are crazy.

06:43.678 --> 06:45.837
The closest I ever
came to breaking the law

06:45.868 --> 06:49.842
was when me and my friend Toby cut out of
school five minutes before the last bell.

06:49.879 --> 06:53.437
Whoo! My heart
was beating so fast.

06:54.188 --> 06:55.785
'Cause you were naked?

06:57.511 --> 06:58.251
No.

07:00.161 --> 07:01.382
I don't get it.

07:03.096 --> 07:04.916
You know what, Hyde?
Your problem is

07:04.952 --> 07:07.206
you didn't handle Jackie's
ultimatum like a man.

07:07.230 --> 07:10.247
Like, if Donna tries that with me,
I'm just gonna say, "hey, guess what.

07:10.283 --> 07:12.958
"You don't get to tell me
what to do with my life."

07:12.982 --> 07:15.201
And then, depending on
how much steam I have left,

07:16.058 --> 07:17.714
I may even call her "toots."

07:20.097 --> 07:20.790
Hey, Eric.

07:21.703 --> 07:26.387
You know how, um, guys always ask me out,
but I say no because I have a boyfriend?

07:26.423 --> 07:28.172
It's true. She won't budge.

07:29.111 --> 07:32.786
Well, since you're going to Africa, I figure,
you know, I should be moving on with my life, too,

07:32.810 --> 07:36.884
and there's this guy named Kevin where I
work, and he asked me out tonight. I said yes.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.305
What? You're gonna... Oh.

07:39.946 --> 07:42.189
I think I see
what's goin' on here.

07:42.306 --> 07:45.359
Looks like somebody's
caught the ultimatum bug.

07:46.592 --> 07:49.586
Okay, um, I'll play along.

07:49.633 --> 07:53.036
You're gonna go out with
this Kevin guy, or what?

07:53.646 --> 07:56.159
Or nothing. This
isn't an ultimatum.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.705
Okay, I'm prepared
for an ultimatum.

08:00.959 --> 08:03.120
I need to figure out
what I'm gonna wear.

08:03.143 --> 08:05.938
Maybe that really
short pink skirt.

08:05.973 --> 08:07.720
Oh, that's over at my place.

08:11.806 --> 08:13.180
You have her skirt?

08:13.215 --> 08:14.847
Don't judge me, new guy.

08:22.264 --> 08:24.859
It feels so good not to be
the monkey in the middle.

08:25.869 --> 08:27.641
Dance, monkey, dance!

08:29.132 --> 08:31.868
I can't believe Donna's goin'
out with this guy from work.

08:31.915 --> 08:34.885
You know, I made a point of going
down there and spreading a rumor that

08:34.991 --> 08:36.421
she had crabs.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.712
Don't talk to me, Forman. This whole
thing with Jackie is all your fault.

08:40.750 --> 08:41.582
How?

08:41.653 --> 08:45.397
Because I wouldn't have even been in the
basement last night when Jackie came over

08:45.413 --> 08:48.020
if we had gone to go play
pinball like I wanted,

08:48.924 --> 08:52.327
but you wouldn't go. So now I
gotta figure out my entire life

08:52.379 --> 08:55.332
because you claim the
change guy touched you weird.

08:56.335 --> 08:59.199
He put the quarters
right into my pocket.

08:59.962 --> 09:03.309
I'm tired of messin' with Charlie. He's
not even reachin' for the ball anymore.

09:03.591 --> 09:06.514
Well, you know, if you want, we
can hang out at my dad's warehouse.

09:06.561 --> 09:08.143
- Oh, that sounds great.
- Really?

09:08.166 --> 09:09.505
No. Shut up.

09:10.679 --> 09:14.178
I have to get down there and unlock the
door. We're getting a shipment today.

09:14.201 --> 09:15.963
Shipment of what?

09:16.010 --> 09:18.262
Beer. My dad owns
a beer warehouse.

09:23.123 --> 09:24.873
Your dad owns a
beer warehouse?

09:25.307 --> 09:26.209
Mm-hmm.

09:26.244 --> 09:27.747
You can touch the ball now.

09:34.088 --> 09:37.012
You had to see Eric's face
when I told him about my date.

09:37.141 --> 09:40.077
He was all nervous
and surprised.

09:40.171 --> 09:42.319
It reminded me
of his sex face.

09:42.986 --> 09:46.567
Donna, I don't wanna hear about
Eric's sex face. I'm upset enough.

09:47.777 --> 09:49.444
You wanna know what
the best part is?

09:49.796 --> 09:51.250
I don't even have a date.

09:51.344 --> 09:53.903
I made the whole thing up
just to mess with Eric's head.

09:54.561 --> 09:57.755
I wish I had manipulated Steven
instead of opening up my heart.

09:57.778 --> 10:00.829
Now I'm the vulnerable
one waiting for his answer.

10:01.111 --> 10:03.013
Yeah, I was a
little surprised.

10:03.048 --> 10:05.267
I mean, the bitchy stuff
is your bread and butter.

10:06.582 --> 10:10.293
You know, I had fake pregnancy right
up my sleeve, and I didn't even use it.

10:17.146 --> 10:17.956
Whoa.

10:20.856 --> 10:22.301
Holy crap.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.473
That's the most
beer I've ever seen.

10:24.509 --> 10:25.800
let me just get the lights.

10:29.792 --> 10:31.483
Let me rephrase that.

10:32.301 --> 10:34.309
That's the most
beer I've ever seen.

10:43.323 --> 10:45.261
It's the mother lode.

10:46.651 --> 10:52.170
It's like now I know how the immigrants felt when
they finally saw the majestic skyline of New York city.

10:52.945 --> 10:56.621
Actually, Eric, most of the
immigrants arrived in the 19th century,

10:56.656 --> 10:58.523
before the skyline
was ever built.

11:01.776 --> 11:03.055
I mean...

11:03.089 --> 11:04.169
beer!

11:04.810 --> 11:05.718
Yeah!

11:09.007 --> 11:09.886
I...

11:10.474 --> 11:11.354
I...

11:11.671 --> 11:14.395
I-I don't know
where to start.

11:15.511 --> 11:18.164
You know, the kegs are cold. Why
don't we start with the kegs?

11:18.188 --> 11:18.996
Hey,

11:19.125 --> 11:21.062
we'll handle this, new guy.

11:23.904 --> 11:25.477
We'll start with the kegs.

11:29.051 --> 11:31.869
There's nothin' like drinkin'
beer straight from the tap.

11:32.479 --> 11:35.250
This must be why babies
love breast-feeding.

11:36.483 --> 11:39.303
Reminds me of an
ancient chinese proverb.

11:39.561 --> 11:40.783
It goes,

11:41.511 --> 11:43.237
somethin',
somethin', somethin',

11:43.601 --> 11:44.858
crazy girlfriend.

11:45.234 --> 11:46.396
Somethin', somethin',

11:46.972 --> 11:48.240
drink lots of beer.

11:54.439 --> 11:58.021
Hyde, I don't think we're gonna find the
answer to our problems in a keg of beer.

11:59.171 --> 12:02.330
Unless they're at the
bottom, so drink up!

12:04.894 --> 12:08.275
I've  been in this warehouse a
hundred times, and I never did this.

12:09.003 --> 12:11.727
Now I know why my
grandmother is an alcoholic.

12:11.810 --> 12:13.489
This feels great!

12:25.655 --> 12:27.508
I'm gonna need
a bigger mouth.

12:32.134 --> 12:32.968
Girls,

12:33.027 --> 12:35.380
please tell me that
Charlie is here.

12:35.416 --> 12:37.287
Isn't he at your
house with the guys?

12:37.310 --> 12:38.038
No.

12:38.167 --> 12:40.140
Oh, sweet lord,
they got him.

12:43.507 --> 12:44.799
You know, Donna,

12:44.834 --> 12:47.593
you should be out there trying
to keep Eric from going to Africa

12:47.628 --> 12:50.059
instead of sitting
here on your patootie.

12:50.528 --> 12:52.019
Well, I'm doing
everything I can.

12:52.054 --> 12:55.271
I even lied to him and told him I
was out on a date with another guy.

12:55.295 --> 12:57.772
Sweetie, that's
amateur hour.

12:58.423 --> 13:00.983
God gave you a
very full chest.

13:01.018 --> 13:04.177
I suggest you start
using it on my son.

13:06.810 --> 13:08.559
I cannot believe
Eric went out.

13:08.595 --> 13:11.730
He's supposed to be
at home agonizing.

13:12.399 --> 13:15.910
Well, maybe they went out to buy
flowers for when Steven proposes.

13:16.593 --> 13:18.801
No, they woulda
just sent Fez.

13:19.998 --> 13:21.443
They're out having fun.

13:21.478 --> 13:23.779
And that is exactly
what we're gonna do.

13:24.343 --> 13:25.137
Okay,

13:25.584 --> 13:26.934
here's what I don't get...

13:27.392 --> 13:31.842
Why would Sally sell seashells
down by the seashore?

13:31.877 --> 13:35.096
I mean, that's a terrible
location for a seashell stand.

13:35.848 --> 13:36.740
Yeah.

13:36.998 --> 13:41.848
I mean, if she wanted to make money,
she would sell seashells by the subway.

13:43.057 --> 13:45.520
You know what she should
sell by the seashore?

13:45.567 --> 13:46.906
Shoeshines.

13:47.059 --> 13:49.689
'Cause your sandals
get so sandy.

13:50.978 --> 13:52.436
Sandy sandals.

13:53.032 --> 13:56.073
We should start a girl
band called Sandy Sandals.

13:57.553 --> 13:58.880
What's wrong?

14:01.140 --> 14:03.300
Well, sand
reminds me of dirt,

14:03.547 --> 14:05.707
and dirt reminds
me of Steven.

14:07.539 --> 14:09.852
Jackie, I'm sure Hyde
will do the right thing.

14:11.726 --> 14:12.642
You know,

14:13.393 --> 14:16.317
I thought if I really
put myself out there,

14:16.481 --> 14:19.687
he'd see how much I love
him and say yes right away.

14:21.049 --> 14:22.656
And then when he
didn't, I thought,

14:22.691 --> 14:26.847
okay, well, maybe he'll take a
couple of hours and then say yes.

14:27.975 --> 14:31.556
But now I think he's only taking
so long 'cause he's gonna say no.

14:32.707 --> 14:34.726
Donna, what if he says no?

14:36.511 --> 14:37.462
Jackie,

14:37.708 --> 14:39.340
if Hyde says no,

14:39.399 --> 14:43.048
then you and I get a van, and
the sandy sandals tour America.

14:47.921 --> 14:51.923
And in a nutshell, that's what it's like to be
on the debate team at a catholic high school.

14:52.521 --> 14:55.410
Yeah, I love
catholic schoolgirls.

14:55.680 --> 14:59.265
They don't teach sex ed, so
they don't know what not to do.

15:00.251 --> 15:02.188
Yeah, maybe. Uh,

15:02.517 --> 15:04.642
but I never really got
together with any of 'em.

15:04.678 --> 15:05.969
Wait, you never...

15:07.253 --> 15:09.889
Okay, wait, wait,
wait. Everyone, wait.

15:09.983 --> 15:12.542
Before you start in on
him, let me just say,

15:12.728 --> 15:14.454
when I was a virgin,

15:14.830 --> 15:18.493
all I wanted was for one
person to say it was okay.

15:21.969 --> 15:23.304
And no one did.

15:24.525 --> 15:26.158
- Neither will I.
- Freak!

15:29.751 --> 15:30.514
Okay...

15:31.218 --> 15:33.834
I finally made up
my mind about Jackie.

15:34.128 --> 15:36.840
I'm gonna marry
her. I'm gonna be

15:37.004 --> 15:38.766
Mrs. Jackie Hyde!

15:41.819 --> 15:43.651
I think you need
one more beer.

15:45.025 --> 15:46.093
Could be.

15:48.700 --> 15:50.097
Virgin.

15:51.422 --> 15:52.385
Man,

15:52.431 --> 15:56.882
how do you not have sex with all those girls
that are always throwing themselves at you?

15:57.868 --> 16:00.392
That doesn't happen
to everyone, jackass.

16:04.680 --> 16:08.473
How dare she give me an ultimatum?
This is my life she's messing with.

16:08.813 --> 16:11.584
She can go to hell! I
will see her in hell!

16:12.390 --> 16:13.869
Maybe one more.

16:15.290 --> 16:16.899
One more couldn't hurt.

16:18.625 --> 16:20.879
Eric, I wonder what
Donna's doin' on her date.

16:20.914 --> 16:22.922
Oh, you know what,
man? I don't care.

16:22.946 --> 16:25.299
She just wants me to come
running after her, and

16:25.452 --> 16:26.826
I'm not gonna do that.

16:26.861 --> 16:29.902
You know what? That is
totally the right move, man.

16:29.925 --> 16:32.084
Plus, it's,
like, after 9:00.

16:32.119 --> 16:35.783
So if you go over there now, you'll
probably walk in on her and that guy

16:35.818 --> 16:38.143
slidin' all over each other.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.128
And if I know Donna,

16:42.163 --> 16:43.901
she's moaning like a ghost.

16:45.791 --> 16:49.032
Okay, Donna does not
moan like a ghost.

16:49.513 --> 16:51.390
I could make her
moan like a ghost.

16:53.598 --> 16:54.983
You know what, guys?

16:56.181 --> 16:57.790
I'm a little confused,

16:58.165 --> 16:58.975
but

16:59.199 --> 17:02.414
I do know that
I love you guys.

17:02.848 --> 17:04.704
I really, really do.

17:14.175 --> 17:15.738
Hey, where'd Kelso go?

17:23.704 --> 17:25.373
Well, hello,

17:25.420 --> 17:26.559
toots.

17:30.938 --> 17:33.472
Back from your
date so soon, huh?

17:33.507 --> 17:36.208
Used to be you had to buy a
girl dinner if you want her to

17:36.243 --> 17:38.932
slide all over you,
moaning like a ghost.

17:41.245 --> 17:42.572
Okay, you know what?

17:42.666 --> 17:45.261
I didn't have a
date. But I should've.

17:45.379 --> 17:47.351
- Wait, so you lied?
- Yeah.

17:47.410 --> 17:48.749
I was pissed.

17:49.242 --> 17:51.878
I mean, all of a sudden,
you're leaving me.

17:52.265 --> 17:55.083
Well, look, I'm only
gonna be gone for a year.

17:55.118 --> 17:56.434
I don't care.

17:56.469 --> 17:57.913
I don't want you to go.

17:58.887 --> 18:01.810
I mean, you've always been, like,
20 steps away from me my entire life.

18:01.846 --> 18:03.771
What am I supposed
to do without you?

18:05.485 --> 18:06.225
Look,

18:06.413 --> 18:09.847
Donna, this is gonna be
really tough for both of us.

18:10.845 --> 18:14.191
But, hey, you know what? The
good news is, when I come back,

18:14.215 --> 18:16.563
we're gonna spend all
this time together because,

18:16.950 --> 18:21.318
you know, you're probably gonna have to nurse me
back to health from some horrible african disease.

18:24.453 --> 18:25.193
Look...

18:25.709 --> 18:27.167
You know I love you.

18:28.329 --> 18:30.337
And we're wasting
our time fighting.

18:30.513 --> 18:31.887
I know. You're right.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.994
We should just enjoy
the time we have left.

18:38.299 --> 18:39.215
Yeah.

18:39.943 --> 18:41.587
I'm all for that.

18:44.874 --> 18:47.969
Well, that's not what
I had in mind, but okay.

18:49.272 --> 18:50.763
Wait, Eric, you're back.

18:50.822 --> 18:52.713
Um, where's Steven?

18:53.159 --> 18:54.122
Uh...

18:57.280 --> 19:01.091
Okay, he's passed out in
the back of a beer warehouse.

19:02.453 --> 19:04.144
You mean he's not coming.

19:04.895 --> 19:07.271
He's gonna say
no. Oh, my god.

19:07.459 --> 19:08.950
Oh, Jackie, I'm sorry.

19:10.159 --> 19:11.075
What?

19:19.498 --> 19:21.260
I'm too drunk anyway.

19:28.673 --> 19:31.362
All right, you two.
Where's Charlie?

19:31.409 --> 19:33.476
Look, dad, not
so loud, okay? We

19:33.499 --> 19:35.342
We had a really rough night.

19:35.577 --> 19:36.361
Oh.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.416
I'm sorry.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.093
Where's Charlie?!

19:44.825 --> 19:46.046
Who is Charlie?

19:47.878 --> 19:52.715
Last time I saw him, he was on a stack of
kegs claiming mount schlitz for the U. S.

19:53.864 --> 19:55.531
Oh, crap.

19:55.789 --> 19:57.785
And he was a good kid.

19:57.868 --> 20:00.157
Now who am I gonna
spend time with?

20:01.543 --> 20:02.832
I don't know.

20:02.867 --> 20:03.807
Me?

20:05.509 --> 20:07.294
Don't be a smart-ass.

20:09.384 --> 20:11.263
Well, it's almost noon.

20:11.804 --> 20:13.589
Guess I gotta go
talk to Jackie.

20:13.741 --> 20:14.974
What are you
gonna tell her?

20:15.338 --> 20:19.119
I don't know, man. I'm thinkin' about
lettin' the El Camino make the final decision.

20:19.800 --> 20:22.078
If it pulls to
the left, marriage,

20:22.560 --> 20:25.097
pulls to the
right, nudie bar.

20:26.787 --> 20:29.093
So you haven't decided?

20:29.821 --> 20:31.077
No, I've decided.

20:32.886 --> 20:33.895
Steven...

20:35.398 --> 20:38.626
Jackie stopped by and asked
me to give you this note.

20:41.644 --> 20:42.349
Oh.

20:43.135 --> 20:46.153
It says she took the job in
Chicago and she left this morning.

20:46.186 --> 20:48.217
Oh, you poor baby.

20:49.216 --> 20:50.366
You know what?

20:50.742 --> 20:55.474
I am gonna turn my back and let you
go into the kitchen and have a beer.

20:59.015 --> 21:00.835
That better be charlie.

21:06.704 --> 21:09.369
Mr. Forman, is
this your daughter?

21:11.659 --> 21:13.760
I don't know who
did this to him, but

21:13.796 --> 21:15.263
they sure are clever.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.099
They put you in
a dress, huh?

21:19.015 --> 21:20.729
Welcome to Point Place.

21:27.802 --> 21:29.998
Listen, Charlie,
about last night,

21:30.021 --> 21:32.017
I know you're thinking you're
getting picked on a lot.

21:32.053 --> 21:33.851
Hey, I know you guys
were just havin' some fun.

21:33.874 --> 21:35.225
Let me finish.

21:36.199 --> 21:39.440
Around here, I'm the
whipping boy. Not you, me.

21:39.475 --> 21:40.121
Okay.

21:40.148 --> 21:42.015
Let me finish.

21:43.107 --> 21:46.488
I do the drinking and I put on
the dresses. You got it, hotshot?

21:47.451 --> 21:48.003
Got it.

21:48.038 --> 21:49.424
Would you let me finish?!

21:51.310 --> 21:52.343
I'm finished.
