WEBVTT

00:06.397 --> 00:08.269
Aiden takes his
flight test today.

00:11.837 --> 00:14.057
Is that for us?

00:14.188 --> 00:15.711
- Out of the car. Now!
- Hey, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa,

00:15.841 --> 00:16.407
<i>whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:18.975
The system needs work.

00:19.106 --> 00:19.932
We don't wait for change.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.021
We make it happen.

00:28.898 --> 00:30.943
Would you take $60?

00:31.074 --> 00:33.772
$75. Final offer.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.600
It's worth it. Trust me.

00:35.731 --> 00:38.647
- And you're sure I need it?
- It's not a public pier, bro.

00:38.777 --> 00:40.910
You want to surf fish,
you got to have a license,

00:41.041 --> 00:42.825
even for catch-and-release.

00:42.955 --> 00:44.827
Really? How often they check?

00:44.957 --> 00:47.612
Do I look like the kind of guy
who would scam you?

00:49.571 --> 00:51.007
Your silence hurts.

00:51.138 --> 00:53.444
Look, you want
to risk it, be my guest.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.403
But you're gonna wish
you had made this deal

00:55.533 --> 00:57.100
if you get hit
with a $1,000 fine.

00:57.231 --> 01:00.321
O-Okay, you got a deal.

01:06.936 --> 01:09.069
- That normal?
- Uh-uh.

01:13.464 --> 01:15.162
Oh, holy hell.

01:15.292 --> 01:16.424
Look.

01:16.554 --> 01:19.775
Come on.

01:28.479 --> 01:30.351
I got a pulse.

01:30.481 --> 01:31.874
He's still breathing.

01:32.004 --> 01:33.005
Come on. We got to go.

01:33.136 --> 01:34.964
Those licenses being legit?

01:35.095 --> 01:36.487
That may have been a lie.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.185
Hey, there's nothing
we can do for him.

01:38.315 --> 01:40.317
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

01:40.448 --> 01:41.753
- I can't.
- Come on.

01:41.884 --> 01:43.059
Rescue's on the way.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.626
Come on, man.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.238
Shyla.

02:31.368 --> 02:32.804
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

02:32.935 --> 02:34.371
It's okay. I just...
I didn't see you there.

02:34.502 --> 02:37.592
Trying to find privacy
around here is really tough.

02:37.722 --> 02:39.898
Tell me about it.
This is one of the only places

02:40.029 --> 02:41.683
I could find to pray.

02:41.813 --> 02:43.293
You don't mind doing it in here?

02:43.424 --> 02:47.079
Oh, not at all.
Anywhere is a place of prayer.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.820
Except for washrooms
and graveyards.

02:48.951 --> 02:50.605
I'm finishing up, though.

02:50.735 --> 02:52.694
Thanks.

02:52.824 --> 02:56.306
Ugh. God. Why are men so...?

02:56.437 --> 02:57.960
Sorry.

02:58.090 --> 03:00.397
Oh, no, please do tell.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.443
Unless you don't want to.

03:02.573 --> 03:05.620
It's my husband.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.665
Um, or my ex-husband now,
I guess.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.928
I had no idea you were married.

03:10.059 --> 03:11.408
I tend not to broadcast it.

03:11.539 --> 03:13.280
We've been separated
for three years now,

03:13.410 --> 03:16.457
but we've only started divorce
proceedings a couple months ago.

03:16.587 --> 03:19.590
Oh, if I might ask, why now?

03:19.721 --> 03:22.245
Timing finally seemed right,
from my end, at least.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.291
I mean, he didn't contest it,
but I know he still wishes

03:24.421 --> 03:26.771
we were together.

03:28.382 --> 03:29.774
And he's not the best
at patience.

03:29.905 --> 03:31.602
Been there.

03:31.733 --> 03:33.561
Everything's been
filed and approved.

03:33.691 --> 03:35.215
We're just trying to figure out
if it's official yet.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.610
I should really...

03:39.741 --> 03:41.743
- The room's all yours.
- Thanks.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.489
Come on.

03:52.493 --> 03:54.582
Come on.

03:54.712 --> 03:57.498
Considering a wardrobe change
already, Agent Rountree?

03:57.628 --> 03:59.151
You've barely been here an hour.

03:59.282 --> 04:01.371
It's funny. Lost my wallet.

04:01.502 --> 04:04.156
I thought it might have been in
one of these undercover outfits.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.947
You mean this wallet?

04:12.077 --> 04:13.862
Oh, damn. Yeah.

04:13.992 --> 04:15.516
Thanks, sir.

04:16.560 --> 04:20.434
Agent Rountree...
are you all right?

04:21.522 --> 04:25.177
LAPD wants me
to meet with a PR rep.

04:25.308 --> 04:26.309
Whiting tipped me off.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.311
They're trying
to push for paid leave

04:28.442 --> 04:30.835
for the officer that pulled me
and my little sister over.

04:30.966 --> 04:33.795
And you're not sure
if you should push for more?

04:33.925 --> 04:35.405
I don't know
what I was hoping for,

04:35.536 --> 04:37.451
but it sure as hell
wasn't paid leave.

04:37.581 --> 04:40.410
Well, I know this is not
my place, Agent Rountree,

04:40.541 --> 04:44.980
but it might not get better,
even if you do push.

04:45.110 --> 04:48.331
Crooked cops have gotten
less for doing worse.

04:48.462 --> 04:51.856
Oh, much worse.

04:51.987 --> 04:53.902
Admiral, do you think that if...

04:54.032 --> 04:56.513
if I wasn't a federal agent,

04:56.644 --> 04:59.081
that this guy would have gotten
any punishment at all?

04:59.211 --> 05:01.605
Unfortunately, that's
a very good question.

05:01.736 --> 05:05.914
And I would never presume
to tell you what to do.

05:06.044 --> 05:09.613
But if you do proceed,

05:09.744 --> 05:12.834
you know that by virtue
of your position here,

05:12.964 --> 05:16.577
you will have to continue
working with the LAPD?

05:16.707 --> 05:19.449
- I'm well aware of that, sir.
- Then you are also aware

05:19.580 --> 05:21.364
that they might try
and make it tough for you.

05:21.495 --> 05:24.498
All due respect, sir,
tough is what I do.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.544
Understood.

05:29.198 --> 05:31.679
Then turning this

05:31.809 --> 05:36.161
into something resembling
a respectable work area again

05:36.292 --> 05:38.773
should be a piece of pie.

05:39.774 --> 05:41.906
I asked for
buttermilk pancakes,

05:42.037 --> 05:43.299
like your mother
used to make.

05:43.430 --> 05:44.996
And?

05:45.127 --> 05:47.477
She made it with a premade mix,
no actual buttermilk.

05:47.608 --> 05:49.610
So you accused her
of being a liar?

05:49.740 --> 05:51.699
Well, if you lie about pancakes,
what else will you lie about?

05:51.829 --> 05:53.962
Now, is this the kind
of person you want caring

05:54.092 --> 05:55.703
- for your dear old pop?
- Raymond,

05:55.833 --> 05:57.531
if I knew you were coming, I
would've brought another coffee.

05:57.661 --> 05:59.881
Oh, don't worry.
I can fend for myself.

06:00.011 --> 06:01.317
- You did not just take my coffee.
- Yeah.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.058
What is this all about?

06:03.188 --> 06:05.408
- His caretaker quit this morning.
- More like

06:05.539 --> 06:07.541
we mutually parted after
irreconcilable differences.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.499
- About pancakes.
- Well, now,

06:09.630 --> 06:10.718
I got to take Raymond's side
on this. I mean,

06:10.848 --> 06:13.329
breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.591
My man.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.376
Right?

06:16.506 --> 06:18.247
All right,
you two enjoy your coffee.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.901
I have something to do,

06:20.031 --> 06:22.338
like find someone
to take care of him last minute.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.166
Huh. Did you try Castor?

06:24.296 --> 06:26.124
Not helping.

06:26.255 --> 06:27.691
Is there anything better
than messing with him?

06:27.822 --> 06:28.736
I can't think of much.

06:28.866 --> 06:30.259
Hello?

06:30.390 --> 06:32.566
What kind of accident?

06:33.654 --> 06:35.133
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

06:36.178 --> 06:38.528
Aiden's plane went down
this morning.

06:38.659 --> 06:40.182
He's been airlifted
to a hospital

06:40.312 --> 06:42.358
near NAS Point Mugu.
No word on his condition.

06:42.489 --> 06:43.838
Oh, my God.

06:43.968 --> 06:46.275
Go. I'll see
what the office knows.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.233
Fatima?
Callen.

06:48.364 --> 06:49.626
We just heard about Aiden.

06:49.757 --> 06:51.149
Have you learned anything?

06:51.280 --> 06:53.325
Not much other than
his F-35 crashed near Ventura.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.240
Shyla has an update
coming in right now.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.373
Okay, great.
We'll loop you in.

06:58.243 --> 07:00.202
Admiral, Callen, Fatima,

07:00.332 --> 07:02.117
this is Lieutenant Commander
Kristina Hirsch.

07:02.247 --> 07:03.727
Good to meet you all.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.337
Wish it was under
different circumstances.

07:05.468 --> 07:06.991
What can you tell us?
How's Aiden?

07:07.122 --> 07:08.819
He's still undergoing
testing, but it looks like

07:08.950 --> 07:10.952
Lieutenant Hanna is
going to be all right.

07:11.082 --> 07:12.954
He'll be held at the hospital
overnight for observation.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.651
I'll be meeting
with him soon.

07:14.782 --> 07:16.697
Understood.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.742
Do we know
what caused the crash?

07:18.873 --> 07:20.440
That's what I've been tasked
to find out.

07:20.570 --> 07:23.051
I'll be leading a JAGMAN
investigation of the incident.

07:23.181 --> 07:25.923
Could be a straightforward case
of equipment malfunction

07:26.054 --> 07:28.360
or pilot error,
but we can't be certain

07:28.491 --> 07:30.580
that an external factor
can be to blame.

07:30.711 --> 07:33.757
An F-35 was taken down
by a drone swarm

07:33.888 --> 07:36.107
near the same area
last year.

07:36.238 --> 07:38.109
We worked that case.
Is there any reason to believe

07:38.240 --> 07:39.720
it could have happened again?

07:39.850 --> 07:41.417
We made some detection
improvements since then,

07:41.548 --> 07:42.549
so I'd say it's unlikely.

07:42.679 --> 07:44.638
But we can't rule
anything out yet.

07:44.768 --> 07:47.075
And since it happened
right in your backyard,

07:47.205 --> 07:49.817
I'd appreciate your help
in getting to the bottom of it.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.645
Of course. Anything you need.

07:51.775 --> 07:53.429
I'm going to debrief
Lieutenant Hanna myself,

07:53.560 --> 07:55.387
and I could use some assistance

07:55.518 --> 07:57.825
in gathering evidence
and interviewing witnesses.

07:57.955 --> 07:59.304
That's our specialty.

07:59.435 --> 08:01.306
Lieutenant Hanna was
on a test flight out

08:01.437 --> 08:03.047
of NAS Point Mugu
when he went down.

08:03.178 --> 08:06.181
Luckily, barely missed
an apartment complex.

08:06.311 --> 08:08.879
There's a few eyewitnesses
being held at a beach nearby,

08:09.010 --> 08:10.881
and I also need someone to talk

08:11.012 --> 08:12.404
to the squadron's
maintenance chief.

08:12.535 --> 08:15.451
Agent Namazi, you and
Agent Rountree hit the beach.

08:15.582 --> 08:18.019
Ms. Dahr, meet
Agent Callen

08:18.149 --> 08:20.456
at the boatshed and talk
to the maintenance chief.

08:20.587 --> 08:21.936
I will hold things down here.

08:22.066 --> 08:23.764
Can do.

08:23.894 --> 08:25.156
There is one catch.

08:25.287 --> 08:26.593
I want to be clear

08:26.723 --> 08:28.769
that Special Agent Hanna
cannot be involved

08:28.899 --> 08:31.511
in any part of this
crash investigation.

08:31.641 --> 08:33.295
As Lieutenant Hanna's father,

08:33.425 --> 08:36.167
this would be a very obvious
conflict of interest.

08:36.298 --> 08:38.169
Let me be the one to tell him.

08:38.300 --> 08:41.869
Oh, I'm-I'm sure
he'll have no problem with that.

08:53.141 --> 08:54.838
I'm sorry, man,
but this is coming from up high.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.840
I get it. I don't
like it, but I get it.

08:56.971 --> 08:58.581
But if you find anything,

08:58.712 --> 09:00.322
and I mean anything,
you call me, all right?

09:00.452 --> 09:01.366
You know I will.

09:01.497 --> 09:02.890
All right, I got to go.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.500
Love you too, sis.

09:04.631 --> 09:05.936
Aiden.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.330
I'm all right, Dad, really.

09:08.460 --> 09:11.028
My boy.
It's good to see you.

09:11.159 --> 09:13.683
You too, Major. I just
got off the phone with Kam.

09:13.814 --> 09:16.425
- Uh, she says hi.
- How are you?

09:16.556 --> 09:18.122
I'm fine, Dad, I swear.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.820
Uh, this is...

09:19.950 --> 09:21.386
- Yeah?
- This is all
from the ejection.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.345
You don't look fine.

09:23.475 --> 09:25.695
Yeah, I mean, uh,
it did knock me out.

09:25.826 --> 09:27.349
And they said
I have a concussion.

09:27.479 --> 09:29.394
I must have twisted my ankle
by the way I landed, but...

09:29.525 --> 09:31.353
Okay....I'll take that
over the alternative any day.

09:31.483 --> 09:33.137
Any landing
you can walk away from.

09:33.268 --> 09:34.748
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.532
What happened out there?

09:36.663 --> 09:37.968
I don't remember.

09:38.099 --> 09:40.188
I've been trying
to go over it in my mind.

09:40.318 --> 09:41.624
Sorry to intrude.

09:41.755 --> 09:43.931
At ease, Lieutenant.

09:44.061 --> 09:45.715
Pleasure to meet you,
Special Agent Hanna.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.717
You, too.

09:47.848 --> 09:50.372
Lieutenant Commander
Kristina Hirsch.

09:50.502 --> 09:53.418
I'm heading the JAGMAN
investigation into the incident.

09:53.549 --> 09:56.421
Lieutenant Hanna,
how are you feeling?

09:56.552 --> 09:59.207
All things considered,
I'm... I'm okay.

09:59.337 --> 10:01.731
Then we can get started
on your official statement.

10:03.646 --> 10:06.475
Master Chief Frazier, you direct
all aircraft maintenance

10:06.606 --> 10:08.825
- and inspections in the squadron?
- Yes, ma'am.

10:08.956 --> 10:10.000
And as soon
as any mishap occurs,

10:10.131 --> 10:11.915
all maintenance records,
log books and files

10:12.046 --> 10:13.874
on the incident plane
are locked down.

10:14.004 --> 10:16.224
- So they can't be altered?
- Correct.

10:16.354 --> 10:17.878
And I did that as soon
as I was made aware.

10:18.008 --> 10:19.183
They're available
for you to examine.

10:19.314 --> 10:21.664
We will. Right now
we're interested in your take.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.144
Was there anything
in those records

10:23.274 --> 10:25.320
that you thought
- was a red flag?
- No, sir.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.801
The incident plane was
a relatively new airframe,

10:27.931 --> 10:29.150
next phase maintenance
wasn't due

10:29.280 --> 10:31.195
for another 100 flight hours.

10:31.326 --> 10:33.067
Was it given a proper pre-flight
inspection this morning?

10:33.197 --> 10:35.504
Of course. The plane was
certified for safe flight.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.767
Sonic would have confirmed
the same before takeoff.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.900
Sonic?

10:40.030 --> 10:41.641
That's Lieutenant Hanna's
call sign.

10:41.771 --> 10:43.381
Sam's never mentioned that?

10:43.512 --> 10:46.167
I don't think he even knows.
Why Sonic?

10:46.297 --> 10:48.038
That's Lieutenant
Hanna's story to tell.

10:48.169 --> 10:49.779
He's a great pilot.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.172
I was shocked to hear
that everything went sideways.

10:51.302 --> 10:54.610
We understand
this was a test flight.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.438
What exactly were they testing?

10:56.568 --> 10:58.440
That's classified.

10:58.570 --> 11:00.572
It's a system being developed
by Starling Aeronautics,

11:00.703 --> 11:03.097
and they keep
pretty tight-lipped.

11:03.227 --> 11:05.229
I'm not sure
how much I can say, but...

11:05.360 --> 11:07.797
But... what?

11:07.928 --> 11:11.583
Between you and me, they're
behind schedule and over budget.

11:11.714 --> 11:14.717
Now, if you want to know more,
you'll have to talk to our CO.

11:15.892 --> 11:17.807
I'll call the admiral.

11:21.376 --> 11:25.032
All right, Lieutenant Hanna,
talk me through the flight.

11:25.162 --> 11:28.165
Uh, well, um,
the takeoff was normal.

11:28.296 --> 11:31.908
Proceeded to flight level
1-0-0 out to sea.

11:32.039 --> 11:34.084
And once
we reached the exercise area,

11:34.215 --> 11:36.086
the systems test went off
without a hitch.

11:36.217 --> 11:38.915
But then, um...
then, on the way back...

11:41.831 --> 11:43.137
What is it?

11:43.267 --> 11:45.182
Well, I'm not sure
what happened next.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.619
Uh... my memory is just...

11:47.750 --> 11:48.882
It's really fuzzy.

11:49.012 --> 11:51.667
Take your time, son.

11:55.062 --> 11:58.326
I distinctly remember realizing
that I had to punch out,

11:58.456 --> 12:00.023
but before that,
it's just...

12:00.154 --> 12:02.286
it's just not as clear.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.811
Why don't you try
working backwards?

12:04.941 --> 12:06.334
That helps me.

12:08.423 --> 12:09.598
Nah.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.034
I'm sorry. I just...

12:11.165 --> 12:13.080
I just... I just
can't remember anything.

12:13.210 --> 12:14.995
We'll get back to that later.

12:15.125 --> 12:18.215
Right before the incident, the
plane was taken off autopilot.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.261
Do you remember doing that?

12:20.391 --> 12:22.263
N-No.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.788
You have been the recipient
of some reprimands

12:25.919 --> 12:27.355
and Letters of Instruction

12:27.485 --> 12:31.228
for, shall we say,
pushing the envelope?

12:31.359 --> 12:32.752
For example,

12:32.882 --> 12:35.058
last year
you were given an LOI

12:35.189 --> 12:37.626
for breaking the sound barrier
over the continental USA.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.671
What?

12:39.802 --> 12:41.195
He'd never do that.

12:43.284 --> 12:44.720
Aiden.

12:44.851 --> 12:45.721
Please don't act like you were

12:45.852 --> 12:46.853
Mr. Perfect all the time.

12:46.983 --> 12:48.289
Even if he did that,

12:48.419 --> 12:50.073
that doesn't have anything
to do with this.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.119
Pilot performance is a big part
of this investigation.

12:52.249 --> 12:54.599
And Lieutenant Hanna has
developed a reputation

12:54.730 --> 12:56.166
for flat-hatting.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.255
Showing off.
Who hasn't had

12:58.386 --> 13:00.040
a little bit of fun
every now and then?

13:00.170 --> 13:01.693
Well, that little bit of fun

13:01.824 --> 13:04.609
overstressed
a $94 million airplane.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.960
$94 million?
I mean, what has it got,

13:07.090 --> 13:08.526
jewel-encrusted afterburners?

13:08.657 --> 13:10.224
Dad.

13:10.354 --> 13:12.574
Special Agent Hanna,
Major Hanna,

13:12.704 --> 13:14.489
I allowed you
to stay in the room

13:14.619 --> 13:16.099
out of deference
for your standing

13:16.230 --> 13:18.319
as decorated
combat veterans,

13:18.449 --> 13:20.495
but you need to stay silent.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.236
I wasn't made aware
that my son's integrity

13:22.366 --> 13:23.846
would be called into question.

13:26.283 --> 13:28.242
This was a mistake.

13:28.372 --> 13:30.026
I need you both
to wait outside.

13:30.157 --> 13:32.333
Hey, I'm his father.

13:32.463 --> 13:35.640
Come on, son. Let's...
let's let her do her job.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.991
It's okay, Dad.

13:42.212 --> 13:44.562
<i>All right, thanks, guys.</i>

13:44.693 --> 13:47.435
- Any luck on your end?
- No, it's weird.

13:47.565 --> 13:49.654
None of them noticed anything
until the explosion.

13:49.785 --> 13:52.135
Ah, same, but maybe
that's good news.

13:52.266 --> 13:54.964
I mean, you know, no evidence
of another drone swarm.

13:55.095 --> 13:57.053
Yeah,
or a surface-to-air missile.

13:57.184 --> 13:59.795
Even if no one saw it fired,
it would leave a smoke trail.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.797
Yeah, but still you'd think

14:01.928 --> 14:04.365
something like a plane going
down would draw more attention.

14:04.495 --> 14:07.585
Yeah, not when there's
good swells and offshore winds.

14:07.716 --> 14:11.154
Yeah, well, maybe the wind
made it difficult to hear,

14:11.285 --> 14:12.677
especially out
over the water.

14:12.808 --> 14:14.201
I know it was early,

14:14.331 --> 14:16.594
but just doesn't seem
like a lot of people.

14:16.725 --> 14:19.467
Oh? I mean, these guys said
that they saw a van leaving

14:19.597 --> 14:20.947
shortly after
the plane went down,

14:21.077 --> 14:22.905
but they didn't
get a good look.

14:23.036 --> 14:24.907
Might not need to.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.388
Entrance has
a license plate reader.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.912
Ah. Well, it's automated.
That might take a minute.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.132
It's worth a shot.
Shall we?

14:32.262 --> 14:33.481
<i>Commander Espinoza,</i>

14:33.611 --> 14:35.700
thank you for taking the time.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.833
Of course, Admiral. Though as
I'm sure you can imagine,

14:37.964 --> 14:39.574
things are pretty hectic
around here today.

14:39.704 --> 14:42.533
Understood. I won't keep you
any longer than I need to.

14:42.664 --> 14:44.361
What can you tell us
about the system

14:44.492 --> 14:46.711
that Starling Aeronautics
was testing

14:46.842 --> 14:47.843
on this morning's flight?

14:47.974 --> 14:49.497
It's a software package

14:49.627 --> 14:52.108
that upgrades the F-35's
electronic warfare capabilities.

14:52.239 --> 14:53.849
And that can be done
via software?

14:53.980 --> 14:56.460
Short answer, yes. It's not
the most elegant analogy,

14:56.591 --> 14:58.636
but this plane's basically
a flying computer.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.247
There's a lot you can improve
on the software side alone.

15:00.377 --> 15:04.381
Any reason to believe that the
system could have had anything

15:04.512 --> 15:06.340
to do
with Lieutenant Hanna's crash?

15:06.470 --> 15:08.255
It's highly unlikely.

15:08.385 --> 15:09.560
The crash occurred after the
system was successfully tested,

15:09.691 --> 15:11.562
during level flight
back to base.

15:11.693 --> 15:13.956
Still, we will need to speak
to someone at Starling.

15:14.087 --> 15:15.523
I'm sure you understand.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.133
Of course. I'll make sure
the program manager knows

15:17.264 --> 15:18.134
you need to speak with him.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.136
Thank you, Commander.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.659
<i>Can you believe her?</i>

15:21.790 --> 15:24.184
I would've asked you
to leave, too.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.490
Come on, Dad. You saw
what was going on in there.

15:26.621 --> 15:28.318
She's more interested in
putting his character on trial

15:28.449 --> 15:30.103
than actually
finding out what happened.

15:30.233 --> 15:32.235
That may be, but we weren't
exactly helping the cause.

15:32.366 --> 15:35.630
You were the one cracking jokes
about breaking the rules.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.675
And how are you so calm?
You would think you're not

15:37.806 --> 15:39.982
the same hard-ass that used
to make me call you "Major."

15:40.113 --> 15:42.942
Because I'm not. You know?

15:43.072 --> 15:46.249
I learned to let go of a lot
of those things that I held

15:46.380 --> 15:48.643
so hard when I was young.

15:48.773 --> 15:51.602
And I'm sorry.

15:51.733 --> 15:54.388
I'm sorry that I didn't
learn those lessons earlier.

15:55.650 --> 15:58.653
For you and for your mother.

15:58.783 --> 16:02.004
Pop,

16:02.135 --> 16:06.487
it's so easy to look back and
see how things could have been.

16:06.617 --> 16:10.752
And, sure, I didn't
appreciate it at the time,

16:10.882 --> 16:13.581
but...

16:13.711 --> 16:16.410
you helped me turn out to be
the man I am today,

16:16.540 --> 16:17.889
and I love you for it.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.370
I know.

16:20.501 --> 16:22.329
I know.

16:22.459 --> 16:24.896
And seeing the man
that you are today

16:25.027 --> 16:27.073
helped me to loosen my grip.

16:27.203 --> 16:29.423
But eventually you're
gonna have to do

16:29.553 --> 16:31.773
the same thing for Aiden.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.427
And he can handle it.

16:34.558 --> 16:36.125
Trust me.

16:39.781 --> 16:43.350
I remember, um, struggling
with the controls.

16:43.480 --> 16:46.657
The plane was not behaving
like it should have.

16:46.788 --> 16:50.879
It-it had to be some sort
of failure, but I...

16:51.010 --> 16:52.272
you know, I can't say what.

16:52.402 --> 16:54.622
Why didn't you call
any of this in?

16:54.752 --> 16:56.972
I did.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.974
Wait, wait. Didn't I?

17:01.020 --> 17:03.805
Lieutenant Hanna,
is there any chance

17:03.935 --> 17:07.417
you thought you'd deviate
from your flight plan again?

17:07.548 --> 17:08.853
Liven up what would
otherwise have been

17:08.984 --> 17:10.812
a boring flight back
- to Point Mugu?
- No, ma'am.

17:10.942 --> 17:13.119
I swear it.

17:13.249 --> 17:14.468
As you're aware,
the flight was

17:14.598 --> 17:16.513
being monitored in real time.

17:16.644 --> 17:18.559
And all the data shows
everything working fine

17:18.689 --> 17:21.779
up until the plane was
taken off autopilot.

17:21.910 --> 17:24.434
All indications point to that
as the first event

17:24.565 --> 17:25.914
in the crash sequence.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.657
What, exactly,
are you saying, Commander?

17:29.787 --> 17:31.833
Your actions may have
directly caused this crash.

17:31.963 --> 17:35.750
The leading theory so far
is pilot error.

17:49.459 --> 17:51.113
We're gonna pause
for a little bit.

17:51.244 --> 17:53.333
Hopefully with time
more will come back to him.

17:53.463 --> 17:54.725
And until then?

17:54.856 --> 17:55.813
I've got a lot of
paperwork to start on.

17:58.860 --> 18:01.036
Well, now I'm a little hungry,
so can you show me where

18:01.167 --> 18:02.777
they hide the food
around this place?

18:02.907 --> 18:04.126
Uh, you know what? Sure.

18:04.257 --> 18:05.214
I could use
a little bite myself.

18:05.345 --> 18:06.563
Mm-hmm.

18:09.262 --> 18:10.089
Here.

18:10.219 --> 18:11.699
I'll get it.
I-I'm good, Dad.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.353
Just-just let me.

18:13.483 --> 18:16.269
Okay. Take it slow.

18:23.363 --> 18:27.062
So, um, how's it going
with the commander?

18:27.193 --> 18:30.370
Badly. She thinks
this is my fault.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.285
And if they can
blame it on me,

18:32.415 --> 18:33.721
my career as a pilot
might be over.

18:35.984 --> 18:39.553
I just cannot remember.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.468
Well, try to put yourself
back in the cockpit,

18:41.598 --> 18:43.600
go through all your senses,

18:43.731 --> 18:45.776
see if you can
trigger something.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.822
I am not Grandpa, Dad.

18:47.952 --> 18:50.564
Aiden! Whoa, whoa.

18:50.694 --> 18:53.219
Hey. Come on, come on,
sit down. Sit, sit...

18:53.349 --> 18:54.959
I'm good, I'm good,
I'm good.

18:55.090 --> 18:58.137
I just-- I'm good, I just got
a little dizzy is all.

19:01.401 --> 19:04.839
Having a concussion
is not nothing, you know.

19:04.969 --> 19:07.146
They said a series of those
is what could have led to

19:07.276 --> 19:08.843
your grandfather's condition.

19:08.973 --> 19:11.106
Really?
I mean,

19:11.237 --> 19:12.412
yeah, they don't know
for sure,

19:12.542 --> 19:15.066
but they said
at least contributed.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.503
Back in his day, you were
expected to shake

19:16.633 --> 19:17.504
this kind of thing off.

19:17.634 --> 19:18.853
They even told me that, too,

19:18.983 --> 19:20.071
from my time playing football

19:20.202 --> 19:21.769
to being on the teams.

19:21.899 --> 19:22.857
Wait, so you mean you might...

19:22.987 --> 19:24.380
Who can know for sure?

19:24.511 --> 19:26.208
I've had my share of knocks.

19:29.994 --> 19:32.083
But you have to take
this stuff seriously.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.564
I am.

19:34.695 --> 19:36.784
I promise.

19:42.311 --> 19:45.532
So we just wait here until
the project lead shows up?

19:45.662 --> 19:47.011
They don't always come to us.

19:47.142 --> 19:48.752
Enjoy it while you can.

19:50.014 --> 19:51.494
Downtime really isn't my thing.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.583
I've been told
my resting heart rate

19:53.714 --> 19:55.194
is six shots of espresso.

19:55.324 --> 19:57.239
So excuse the abrupt
subject change,

19:57.370 --> 19:58.632
but you don't think Aiden

19:58.762 --> 20:00.024
actually caused
that crash, do you?

20:02.810 --> 20:04.246
What if I said that I did?

20:04.377 --> 20:05.769
A good agent has to put
their emotions aside

20:05.900 --> 20:09.164
and look at a case
from every angle.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.775
Every pilot, even the best,
make mistakes.

20:11.906 --> 20:13.560
True. But the Navy's
F-35 program

20:13.690 --> 20:15.126
is highly selective.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.780
Pilot error wouldn't be
my first instinct.

20:16.911 --> 20:19.000
What about his reprimands?

20:19.130 --> 20:21.959
A lot of fighter pilots
push their limits.

20:22.090 --> 20:23.526
Comes with the job.

20:23.657 --> 20:25.963
Okay, so if it's not
pilot error, what then?

20:26.094 --> 20:29.750
I'm not sure yet. Exactly.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.839
Neither am I.

20:31.969 --> 20:33.623
For the record,
I agree with you.

20:33.754 --> 20:36.191
But pilot performance
isn't our focus,

20:36.322 --> 20:37.584
so we can't rule it out.

20:37.714 --> 20:39.586
Especially if we don't
have evidence

20:39.716 --> 20:40.587
of other factors.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.898
- Do I have the right place?
- Jake Primiani?

20:48.029 --> 20:49.596
Commander Espinoza told me
I had to talk to you,

20:49.726 --> 20:52.381
so here I am.
Can we get this over with?

21:03.566 --> 21:04.959
Hey.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.354
Do you think
that I'd be crazy

21:08.484 --> 21:10.834
to push for more punishment
for Officer McNeil?

21:10.965 --> 21:12.749
What? No.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.535
Absolutely not.

21:15.665 --> 21:17.580
Why? Are you thinking
of letting it go?

21:17.711 --> 21:19.756
I don't know.

21:22.019 --> 21:23.673
Some days I just want to
walk away from all of it,

21:23.804 --> 21:25.501
you know?

21:25.632 --> 21:29.723
But I feel weak
thinking that way.

21:29.853 --> 21:31.768
This morning
I couldn't find my wallet,

21:31.899 --> 21:34.815
and I lost my mind.

21:34.945 --> 21:37.948
Been that way
- ever since the stop.
- I'm so sorry.

21:38.079 --> 21:42.388
But you are not weak,
no matter what you decide.

21:42.518 --> 21:45.086
Right.

21:45.216 --> 21:47.958
I just don't want this to be
what defines me as an agent.

21:48.089 --> 21:50.961
Of course. I get it.

21:51.092 --> 21:53.007
The thing is,
is you can't choose

21:53.137 --> 21:56.227
how people are gonna see you,
whether you fight this or not.

21:58.229 --> 22:02.016
Are you trying to help?
Because...

22:02.146 --> 22:05.802
Look, sure, some of those LAPD
cops have their minds made up,

22:05.933 --> 22:07.804
but if you fight this,

22:07.935 --> 22:09.328
so many other people
are gonna see something

22:09.458 --> 22:11.330
completely different.

22:11.460 --> 22:14.028
Okay, they're gonna see
the same principled,

22:14.158 --> 22:17.074
incredibly brave person I do.

22:17.205 --> 22:19.773
Someone to emulate.

22:21.514 --> 22:22.558
Whatever you do,

22:22.689 --> 22:23.864
you got to do for you.

22:23.994 --> 22:25.605
And only you.

22:25.735 --> 22:29.348
Thanks, I...
I needed that today.

22:29.478 --> 22:31.262
Yeah, for sure.

22:31.393 --> 22:35.005
Hey, tree may bend,
tree don't break.

22:35.136 --> 22:39.358
I like that.

22:39.488 --> 22:42.012
Oh, Parks Department sent over
the license plate logs.

22:42.143 --> 22:43.536
Oh, great.

22:43.666 --> 22:46.669
I got the list of witness
vehicles right here.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.410
Okay, if we cross-reference
them...

22:48.541 --> 22:50.107
Ooh, right there.
That one.

22:50.238 --> 22:51.413
Yeah?
Yeah.

22:51.544 --> 22:53.241
That license plate's
not on the list.

22:53.372 --> 22:56.723
Entered at 6:45 a.m.,
left at 7:37.

22:56.853 --> 23:00.553
Maybe Kaleidoscope can help us
find out where it is now.

23:00.683 --> 23:03.033
Sure, uh, Kilbride
can handle that?

23:03.164 --> 23:05.514
I made the mistake
of underestimating

23:05.645 --> 23:06.515
his Ops skills before.

23:06.646 --> 23:08.169
I am not about
to do it again.

23:08.299 --> 23:10.258
Come on.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.738
Have an update, Agent Namazi?

23:11.868 --> 23:13.392
FATIMA [over tablet]:
More of a request.

23:13.522 --> 23:15.394
You, uh, game to run
a Kaleidoscope search for us?

23:15.524 --> 23:17.526
Ooh, now that's the one
that stitches

23:17.657 --> 23:19.354
all the little pictures
together, right?

23:19.485 --> 23:20.703
Oh...

23:20.834 --> 23:23.314
It's a joke, Rountree.
What's the plate?

23:23.445 --> 23:25.447
3-Papa-Charlie-
India-2-1-4.

23:25.578 --> 23:27.536
Okay.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.016
That matches records for

23:29.146 --> 23:32.541
a 1977 Dodge Tradesman

23:32.672 --> 23:35.414
registered to one
Marco Madsen.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.067
The search is starting now.

23:37.198 --> 23:38.199
Great.

23:38.329 --> 23:39.809
Really good job, sir.

23:39.940 --> 23:42.377
I don't need a pat
on the back, Agent Namazi.

23:42.508 --> 23:44.727
I am not some CYO soccer brat

23:44.858 --> 23:46.990
looking for
a participation trophy.

23:47.121 --> 23:48.165
Of course.

23:48.296 --> 23:49.384
Sorry, sir.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.038
And it looks like
we have a hit.

23:51.168 --> 23:52.474
That was quick.

23:52.605 --> 23:53.997
Probably because it didn't
go very far.

23:54.128 --> 23:57.436
It's parked on a street
just a few miles away.

23:57.566 --> 24:02.310
Sending you the location now.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.355
The F-35 has the most advanced
sensor suite

24:04.486 --> 24:06.183
of any fighter in history.

24:06.314 --> 24:08.621
Our software package will make
that even more formidable,

24:08.751 --> 24:10.753
extending its range
and improving both

24:10.884 --> 24:13.190
its electronic warfare attack
and countermeasure capabilities.

24:13.321 --> 24:14.844
That's impressive,
but we've heard that

24:14.975 --> 24:15.889
the program's behind schedule.

24:16.019 --> 24:19.719
It is.

24:19.849 --> 24:21.808
And that's one of the reasons
I need to get out of here ASAP.

24:21.938 --> 24:23.505
We have another test
flight coming up.

24:23.636 --> 24:24.637
They're putting another plane
in the air this soon?

24:24.767 --> 24:26.639
This system was
supposed to deploy

24:26.769 --> 24:27.988
in a matter of weeks.
If there's a problem with it,

24:28.118 --> 24:29.772
- we need to figure it out now.
- Why can't you just

24:29.903 --> 24:31.513
- test this on a simulator?
- We are.

24:31.644 --> 24:33.907
Pilots have been rerunning
the incident flight all day.

24:34.037 --> 24:35.909
No one's been able to
replicate the problem.

24:36.039 --> 24:37.867
Why is everything
down to the wire

24:37.998 --> 24:39.869
- in the first place?
- There's never enough time.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.175
There's always hiccups, but

24:41.305 --> 24:42.655
the deadlines stay the same.

24:42.785 --> 24:44.091
We're having to
finish our testing

24:44.221 --> 24:45.266
with fleet pilots
from the squadron,

24:45.396 --> 24:47.007
but in a way that helps.

24:47.137 --> 24:48.791
Puts us in more real-world
situations.

24:48.922 --> 24:50.837
Even if it results in an
incident like this morning's?

24:50.967 --> 24:52.969
That's not what I meant.

24:53.100 --> 24:55.537
So what kind of hiccups
have you had, exactly?

24:55.668 --> 24:57.278
Your normal glitches and bugs.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.846
But those were early
in sim testing.

24:59.976 --> 25:02.762
We shook them all out before
we ever hit the skies for real.

25:02.892 --> 25:03.980
Since then it's been
smooth sailing.

25:04.111 --> 25:06.156
Which is why we can't
afford this setback.

25:06.287 --> 25:08.681
Speaking of, um, I really need
to get to the hangar

25:08.811 --> 25:09.899
to prep this flight.

25:10.030 --> 25:11.988
Am I free to go?

25:12.119 --> 25:13.555
Go.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.869
Come on, damn machine.

25:22.999 --> 25:25.262
You know, the same thing
happened to me earlier.

25:25.393 --> 25:27.743
Turns out they made all the
machines cashless after COVID.

25:27.874 --> 25:28.918
Cashless?

25:29.049 --> 25:32.182
Yeah. I'll show you.

25:32.313 --> 25:33.444
What did you want?

25:33.575 --> 25:35.055
I just--
You don't have to.

25:35.185 --> 25:36.535
No, it'd be my pleasure.

25:36.665 --> 25:38.754
Well, I was going
to get a Twinkie.

25:38.885 --> 25:40.843
Oh, a man after
my own heart.

25:46.588 --> 25:49.504
Would you look at that?

25:49.635 --> 25:51.898
Oh, no. It's my treat.

25:52.028 --> 25:53.682
In fact,

25:53.813 --> 25:57.077
I think I'll get one
for myself, too.

25:57.207 --> 25:58.644
So how is Grandpop?

25:58.774 --> 26:01.255
Well, he has his
good days and bad.

26:01.385 --> 26:04.824
What about living together
again? That can't be easy.

26:04.954 --> 26:06.608
Well, we haven't killed each
other so far, so I can say that.

26:06.739 --> 26:09.611
Although he did basically fire
the caretaker this morning

26:09.742 --> 26:11.178
when she...

26:11.308 --> 26:12.962
What is it?

26:13.093 --> 26:16.923
No... The engine flamed out.

26:17.053 --> 26:20.404
I-I just remembered,
that's what started it all.

26:20.535 --> 26:22.319
That's what caused the autopilot
to disengage,

26:22.450 --> 26:23.886
then the electronics
went haywire.

26:24.017 --> 26:26.846
- Commander Hirsch doesn't know?
- No, no.

26:26.976 --> 26:29.544
She said the data supports
everything working fine

26:29.675 --> 26:30.545
until the autopilot went off.

26:30.676 --> 26:34.244
I'll call it in.
Try to find her.

26:34.375 --> 26:35.506
<i>Well, this gives</i>

26:35.637 --> 26:37.813
♪vanlife a new meaning.

26:40.381 --> 26:42.905
- Marco Madsen?
- Who's asking?

26:43.036 --> 26:44.080
NCIS.

26:46.213 --> 26:47.867
One, two, three. Ho!

26:47.997 --> 26:49.956
- Whoa!
- Yeah, we just want
to talk, my man.

26:50.086 --> 26:54.003
I-I-I swear I got all
those fishing licenses legally.

26:54.134 --> 26:56.745
Fishing licenses?
What are you talking about?

26:56.876 --> 26:59.269
Uh...

26:59.400 --> 27:00.923
What are <i>you</i> talking about?

27:01.054 --> 27:02.359
We're investigating
a plane crash,

27:02.490 --> 27:03.447
we were hoping
that you might have

27:03.578 --> 27:04.318
seen something this morning.

27:04.448 --> 27:06.363
Oh, yeah, that.

27:06.494 --> 27:08.235
I did see that.

27:08.365 --> 27:11.673
Uh, a fighter plane.
It crashed.

27:11.804 --> 27:15.242
Yeah, it crashed.

27:15.372 --> 27:16.460
Can you elaborate?

27:16.591 --> 27:19.942
I knew it was in trouble.

27:20.073 --> 27:21.944
Um, it was out of control.

27:22.075 --> 27:24.338
It was making some
strange noises, too.

27:24.468 --> 27:25.774
The engine was out.

27:25.905 --> 27:27.646
- Wait, the engine was out?
- Yeah.

27:27.776 --> 27:30.344
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

27:30.474 --> 27:33.913
Because it kicked back in
just before the pilot ejected.

27:34.043 --> 27:35.479
Guess it was too late.

27:35.610 --> 27:38.352
Well, that contradicts
Commander Hirsch's data.

27:38.482 --> 27:39.440
But it confirms Aiden's account.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.616
I'm gonna call Kilbride.

27:41.747 --> 27:44.271
All right.

27:44.401 --> 27:47.230
Now, about those fishing licenses.

27:47.361 --> 27:49.145
- Commander, is this a bad time?
- No, Admiral.

27:49.276 --> 27:50.930
Just a little busy.
We have a flight in the air

27:51.060 --> 27:52.366
retesting Starling's system
right now.

27:52.496 --> 27:56.022
I heard, which is why
I'm passing this on directly.

27:56.152 --> 27:58.459
We have a report
from an eyewitness

27:58.589 --> 28:01.375
that backs up
Lieutenant Hanna's claims.

28:01.505 --> 28:04.639
Evidently, his engine
did cut out and stayed out

28:04.770 --> 28:06.815
- until just before impact.
- Don't worry, Admiral,

28:06.946 --> 28:07.860
we have the plane
at a higher altitude

28:07.990 --> 28:09.818
in closed airspace
over the ocean.

28:09.949 --> 28:11.559
Plenty of time to troubleshoot
if a problem arises.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.040
Sir, I can't raise the pilot.

28:14.170 --> 28:17.478
I've lost his transponder
but still have him on radar.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.393
Kegger, this is Charlie Oscar. Over.

28:19.523 --> 28:20.481
He's losing altitude.

28:20.611 --> 28:21.874
Kegger, this is Charlie Oscar.

28:22.004 --> 28:23.353
Are you reading me?

28:23.484 --> 28:25.399
Still no contact.

28:35.626 --> 28:37.759
Passing 5,000 feet.
Still no contact.

28:37.890 --> 28:40.109
Commander, I am patching you
through to one of my agents

28:40.240 --> 28:42.808
who is with Lieutenant Hanna now.

28:42.938 --> 28:44.113
They are aware of the situation.

28:44.244 --> 28:45.593
Go ahead.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.029
Agent Hanna, you are on

28:47.160 --> 28:48.901
- with Commander Espinoza.
- We've got you.

28:49.031 --> 28:50.380
Who's up there, Commander?

28:50.511 --> 28:51.599
Lieutenant Keck.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.122
Damn.

28:54.863 --> 28:56.212
If it's the same issue,

28:56.343 --> 28:58.127
he can hear you
but you can't hear him.

28:58.258 --> 28:59.999
- 2,000 feet.
- Kegger, if you can hear me,

29:00.129 --> 29:02.001
you should bypass the VMC and
head straight to generator three

29:02.131 --> 29:03.132
for the reboot.

29:04.177 --> 29:05.134
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes, sir.

29:05.265 --> 29:06.657
That's the only way I was able

29:06.788 --> 29:07.963
to refire the engine.

29:10.009 --> 29:12.402
1,000...He's about to drop off
the scope.

29:12.533 --> 29:14.230
Lieutenant Keck,

29:14.361 --> 29:16.493
bypass the VMC and switch
to generator three.

29:18.713 --> 29:20.149
I've lost him.

29:25.154 --> 29:27.287
Point Mugu Tower,
this is Kegger.

29:27.417 --> 29:29.115
I've regained control
and I have leveled off.

29:29.245 --> 29:32.292
Glad to hear it,
Lieutenant Keck.

29:32.422 --> 29:34.294
Climb back to flight level 5-0

29:34.424 --> 29:35.774
and make your way back to base.

29:35.904 --> 29:38.428
Roger that, sir.
Sonic, if you can hear me,

29:38.559 --> 29:40.387
thank you.

29:40.517 --> 29:42.258
Good job.

29:42.389 --> 29:44.434
That was one hell of a fix,
Lieutenant Hanna.

29:44.565 --> 29:47.307
Definitely not on
the emergency checklist.

29:47.437 --> 29:49.222
Thanks, ma'am. It's-it's
all coming back to me now.

29:49.352 --> 29:51.398
Uh, it was too late for me when
I was able to refire the engine.

29:51.528 --> 29:53.052
I'm glad it wasn't too late
for Kegger.

29:53.182 --> 29:56.098
Well, let's, uh, continue
with your statement, then.

29:56.229 --> 29:57.099
I'll give you two the room.

29:57.230 --> 29:58.448
Where's my father?

29:58.579 --> 30:00.537
Oh, he's not back yet?

30:00.668 --> 30:02.409
I thought the nurse was gonna
bring him back here.

30:13.333 --> 30:15.465
Mr. Primiani,
just who we're looking for.

30:15.596 --> 30:17.119
- Have a minute?
- Not really.

30:17.250 --> 30:18.164
Well, you might want
to make one.

30:18.294 --> 30:19.861
We heard about
the latest incident.

30:19.992 --> 30:23.473
Anything you said previously
that you would like to amend?

30:23.604 --> 30:25.214
No, there's not.
It's still too early

30:25.345 --> 30:26.825
- to pinpoint a cause.
- Is it?

30:26.955 --> 30:28.696
Well, maybe we should
just look at the facts.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.481
Either two elite pilots made
the exact same mistake,

30:31.612 --> 30:33.875
two cutting-edge planes
separately suffered

30:34.006 --> 30:37.487
the exact same never-before-seen
system failure,

30:37.618 --> 30:40.664
or there's a problem
with the one common thread

30:40.795 --> 30:43.885
between the two incidents,
and that would be your system.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.848
Look, okay, it does
have a flaw in it.

30:49.978 --> 30:51.806
But we already knew that.

30:51.937 --> 30:54.461
A-A-And it was patched
months ago during sim testing.

30:54.591 --> 30:56.245
What kind of flaw
are we talking about?

30:56.376 --> 30:57.551
This kind of issue
has the potential

30:57.681 --> 31:00.162
to sink our program,
if not the entire company.

31:00.293 --> 31:01.642
Oh, we are way past
that consideration.

31:05.385 --> 31:07.387
The system can overload
the flight computer.

31:07.517 --> 31:10.477
Which could lead to a flameout
and loss of control?

31:10.607 --> 31:13.175
In a worst-case scenario,
yes, but like I said,

31:13.306 --> 31:14.829
it was patched.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.483
It's never been an issue
since we got out of the sim.

31:16.613 --> 31:18.441
Then how did this happen twice?

31:18.572 --> 31:20.356
Someone must have intentionally
bypassed the fix.

31:20.487 --> 31:22.402
I-I don't see any other way.

31:26.101 --> 31:27.189
Did you have access
to the system

31:27.320 --> 31:29.191
- before both flights?
- Of course.

31:29.322 --> 31:31.019
But I-I would never do this.

31:31.150 --> 31:32.716
You've got to believe me.

31:32.847 --> 31:37.112
My entire career is invested
in this system.

31:37.243 --> 31:39.636
Look, I-I know,
I know it was wrong

31:39.767 --> 31:40.855
to-to withhold the flaw
from you,

31:40.986 --> 31:42.422
but I swear that's all I did.

31:42.552 --> 31:45.555
Well, and maybe injured
another pilot, if not worse.

31:45.686 --> 31:49.037
I'm sorry.
I messed up, I know.

31:49.168 --> 31:50.430
Who else could have done this?

31:50.560 --> 31:52.954
Our servers here on base
are air-gapped,

31:53.085 --> 31:55.652
so the programming would have
had to be done physically here,

31:55.783 --> 31:59.004
but pretty much anyone
on our team has access.

31:59.134 --> 32:01.963
The diagnostic terminal
should have records

32:02.094 --> 32:03.443
of everyone who accessed
- the system.
- Show us.

32:09.710 --> 32:12.017
Sitrep?

32:12.147 --> 32:13.932
Sorry, sir, I couldn't
help myself.

32:14.062 --> 32:18.501
Someone at Starling Aero
likely sabotaged the system,

32:18.632 --> 32:20.721
which means we're going
to have to start scanning

32:20.851 --> 32:24.116
all of their employees,
looking for motives

32:24.246 --> 32:26.292
or targets for espionage.

32:26.422 --> 32:29.164
Okay, sir,
we'll get on it.

32:34.561 --> 32:36.606
- There you are.
- Oh, you must be Sam.

32:36.737 --> 32:40.045
I hear this charming gentleman
is under your care.

32:40.175 --> 32:41.611
Charming?
Hmm.

32:41.742 --> 32:43.744
Oh, cut it out.

32:43.874 --> 32:46.486
My dear, it's been
an absolute pleasure.

32:46.616 --> 32:47.966
Oh...

32:51.621 --> 32:54.189
So...

32:54.320 --> 32:55.669
let me get this straight,

32:55.799 --> 32:57.192
he willingly let you
keep your eye on him

32:57.323 --> 32:58.846
- this whole time?
- Oh, yeah.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.065
He's a sweet one.

33:00.195 --> 33:01.718
Reminds me a lot
of my own dad.

33:01.849 --> 33:03.546
Are you sure we're talking
about the same person?

33:03.677 --> 33:05.853
Do you how hard it is
for me to find someone

33:05.984 --> 33:07.072
he's willing to put up with?

33:07.202 --> 33:09.248
Oh, that's a common story.

33:09.378 --> 33:11.859
It can be tough
to find the right fit.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.731
You know, I'm only per diem
here at the hospital.

33:14.862 --> 33:16.733
I do a bit of home
- care on the side.
- Yeah?

33:16.864 --> 33:18.083
If you need someone,
let me know.

33:18.213 --> 33:21.825
I absolutely will, Constance.

33:21.956 --> 33:23.610
Agent Hanna.

33:25.481 --> 33:27.483
I've heard enough to shift
the investigation

33:27.614 --> 33:30.095
from the crash
to Starling Aero.

33:30.225 --> 33:32.010
Consider yourself released
from the sidelines.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.620
You're free to join
the rest of your team.

33:33.750 --> 33:36.623
But to be clear,
to prove this theory,

33:36.753 --> 33:38.538
we'll need hard evidence
of the sabotage.

33:38.668 --> 33:40.757
Understood.

33:42.281 --> 33:44.413
Dad. Charming.
Prince Charming.

33:44.544 --> 33:46.502
Yeah.
Stay with Aiden.

33:46.633 --> 33:49.201
I mean it.
Thank you.

33:49.331 --> 33:51.377
This is where we program
the system

33:51.507 --> 33:53.379
before it's installed
on the plane.

33:58.340 --> 34:00.560
- Huh.
- What's wrong?

34:05.086 --> 34:06.740
Someone pulled the hard drive.

34:08.046 --> 34:10.352
We need to account for your
employees right now.

34:10.483 --> 34:11.092
Okay, I may have found

34:11.223 --> 34:12.050
something here.

34:12.180 --> 34:13.312
I found a person

34:13.442 --> 34:15.531
with irregular financials,

34:15.662 --> 34:18.317
but the only thing is, they're
not anyone from Starling.

34:18.447 --> 34:19.405
Who is it, then?

34:20.623 --> 34:22.234
Callen.

34:27.630 --> 34:28.370
Frazier.

34:31.156 --> 34:33.506
I told you they don't always
come to us.

34:42.428 --> 34:43.255
Call base security.

35:04.450 --> 35:05.842
Stop the truck!

35:31.390 --> 35:33.000
Frazier, stop.
It's over.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.615
No!

35:40.616 --> 35:43.445
- Drop the gun.
- This all got out of hand.

35:43.576 --> 35:44.664
No one's gonna understand.

35:44.794 --> 35:46.100
Understand what?

35:46.231 --> 35:47.884
Starling knew about the flaw.

35:48.015 --> 35:50.278
They were hiding it.

35:50.409 --> 35:54.239
I was just trying
to make everybody see.

35:54.369 --> 35:56.850
Then those fools started
focusing on the wrong error.

35:56.980 --> 36:01.246
It was the system,
not pilot error!

36:01.376 --> 36:03.813
That's why you did it
a second time.

36:06.686 --> 36:09.776
I didn't want to, but it
would have all been for nothing.

36:09.906 --> 36:13.867
Master Chief Frazier.

36:13.997 --> 36:15.956
I'm Special Agent Sam Hanna.

36:16.086 --> 36:18.001
Aiden's father.

36:20.134 --> 36:21.353
I understand.

36:23.355 --> 36:24.965
If I'm willing to forgive you,

36:25.095 --> 36:29.230
others will, too. Huh?

36:29.361 --> 36:30.275
Put the gun down.

36:34.061 --> 36:35.193
Put it down, please.

36:37.630 --> 36:39.893
I'm sorry.
Put it down.

36:40.023 --> 36:41.024
I'm sorry.

36:44.463 --> 36:45.942
Drop it. Drop the gun.

36:46.073 --> 36:47.422
Drop it.

36:47.553 --> 36:48.554
I'm sorry.

36:48.684 --> 36:50.251
Hands up, on your head.

36:52.775 --> 36:54.951
Relax.

36:55.082 --> 36:57.127
Let's go. With me.

36:57.258 --> 36:58.607
You really mean that?

36:58.738 --> 37:01.871
It's important to be gracious
with forgiveness.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.963
It'll take some time,
but I'm willing to try.

37:15.145 --> 37:17.452
Hey, great work today.

37:17.583 --> 37:20.194
Thanks, but I only had
a small part.

37:20.325 --> 37:23.676
Callen and Sam are very good
at de-escalation.

37:23.806 --> 37:25.634
It's a shame about
Master Chief Frazier, though.

37:25.765 --> 37:27.810
Seems like a good guy
who really lost his way.

37:27.941 --> 37:30.248
I'd say so.

37:30.378 --> 37:32.728
We traced his financials,
and we found a payout

37:32.859 --> 37:33.947
from one of Starling's rivals.

37:34.077 --> 37:35.688
They were trying
to tank the program

37:35.818 --> 37:37.864
so they could swoop in
and steal the contract?

37:37.994 --> 37:39.692
That's what it looks like.

37:39.822 --> 37:44.262
Hey, so, how did your
call go this morning?

37:44.392 --> 37:46.307
I guess as well as it could.

37:46.438 --> 37:48.614
Everything's official now.

37:48.744 --> 37:50.224
It's kind of weird, though,
you know?

37:50.355 --> 37:52.922
You don't get anything
after a divorce.

37:53.053 --> 37:55.229
It just kind of becomes finalized.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.883
I'd be happy to
get you something.

37:57.013 --> 37:59.886
Maybe when we finish these
after action reports,

38:00.016 --> 38:01.801
like a celebration drink.

38:01.931 --> 38:04.934
Unless this is something
you don't want to celebrate.

38:05.065 --> 38:06.458
'Cause we can be sad instead.

38:06.588 --> 38:10.200
No. A celebration
- would be good.
- Great.

38:10.331 --> 38:11.724
Maybe with a little bit
of sadness.

38:11.854 --> 38:14.683
Well, then, the Snake Pit
is calling our name.

38:14.814 --> 38:17.295
It is the right amount
of divey for both.

38:17.425 --> 38:20.559
- Thank you, Fatima.
- Yeah.

38:24.258 --> 38:25.694
Agent Rountree.

38:25.825 --> 38:28.001
Good to see your desk
back in ship shape.

38:28.131 --> 38:29.394
Yeah.

38:29.524 --> 38:31.439
As much as it ever was, I guess.

38:31.570 --> 38:32.919
Yeah.

38:33.049 --> 38:35.269
Still got that damn ball
on display

38:35.400 --> 38:37.227
from beating my Tigers.

38:37.358 --> 38:40.796
That baby's not going
- anywhere anytime soon.
- Hmm.

38:43.582 --> 38:45.497
Well...

38:45.627 --> 38:46.367
Uh, sir.

38:48.630 --> 38:52.982
Uh... what would you
do if, if you were me?

38:53.113 --> 38:55.681
Well, like I said,
Agent Rountree,

38:55.811 --> 38:56.943
this really isn't my place...

38:57.073 --> 38:59.772
I-I know. I know, sir, but...

38:59.902 --> 39:00.990
I'm asking.

39:03.384 --> 39:05.473
Personally, I'd like to see
the bastard's hide

39:05.604 --> 39:06.953
nailed to the outhouse wall,

39:07.083 --> 39:09.564
instead of just
a slap on the wrist.

39:09.695 --> 39:11.131
Yeah.

39:11.261 --> 39:13.002
Even if pushing back
affected our office,

39:13.133 --> 39:14.221
made our jobs harder?

39:16.397 --> 39:19.182
Agent Rountree, you are part

39:19.313 --> 39:22.534
of a very elite team.

39:22.664 --> 39:25.928
Every member of it
is behind you on this,

39:26.059 --> 39:29.323
including me, come what may.

39:31.151 --> 39:32.500
I appreciate that, sir.

39:34.241 --> 39:35.808
Night, Rountree.

39:35.938 --> 39:38.071
Night.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.863
Commander.
Ah, Agent Hanna.

39:47.994 --> 39:52.520
I'm wrapping up here.
Glad I caught you.

39:52.651 --> 39:55.262
My initial take
on your son was wrong.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.264
And I can admit that.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.614
I hope there are
no hard feelings.

39:59.745 --> 40:02.922
Target fixation's
a hell of a thing.

40:03.052 --> 40:04.750
That it is.

40:04.880 --> 40:07.448
It's safe to say that
Lieutenant Hanna

40:07.579 --> 40:09.102
was at no fault
for this incident,

40:09.232 --> 40:11.278
and as soon as he's cleared
by the flight surgeon,

40:11.409 --> 40:13.367
he'll be back up in the sky.

40:13.498 --> 40:14.847
Well, thank you, Commander.

40:14.977 --> 40:16.457
Oh, and I thought
you might like to know

40:16.588 --> 40:18.546
that Commander Espinoza
has written him up

40:18.677 --> 40:20.853
for a commendation. Hmm.

40:20.983 --> 40:22.202
It wasn't luck he
avoided those apartments

40:22.332 --> 40:23.508
when he went down.

40:23.638 --> 40:25.335
By staying with the plane

40:25.466 --> 40:26.772
as long as he did

40:26.902 --> 40:30.384
to refire the engine,
he saved lives.

40:30.515 --> 40:32.734
That's a special son you've got.

40:32.865 --> 40:33.953
Well, I hope you didn't
tell him that.

40:34.083 --> 40:36.085
He's got a big enough
ego as is.

40:36.216 --> 40:39.611
Yeah, most stick jockeys do.

40:39.741 --> 40:42.352
I should know.
I'm one of 'em.

40:44.224 --> 40:45.268
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

40:45.399 --> 40:46.531
When you look down,

40:46.661 --> 40:47.706
you look
straight through the plane

40:47.836 --> 40:49.185
- to the ground?
- Yep.

40:49.316 --> 40:50.535
On the inside of your visor.

40:50.665 --> 40:51.971
Any direction you
turn your head.

40:52.101 --> 40:53.538
It's something else.

40:53.668 --> 40:56.845
Yeah, well, do they have
airsick bags up there, too?

40:58.281 --> 40:59.326
Glad to see you two
haven't

40:59.457 --> 41:00.240
burned this place down.

41:00.370 --> 41:01.676
Yet.

41:01.807 --> 41:03.373
Yeah, well...

41:03.504 --> 41:04.287
- he's gotten good.
- Yeah?

41:04.418 --> 41:05.593
I haven't won a game yet.

41:05.724 --> 41:07.465
That's 'cause I learned
from the best.

41:07.595 --> 41:09.118
Squadron sent you this.

41:09.249 --> 41:10.511
They wanted me to officially
welcome you as a member

41:10.642 --> 41:12.339
of the Martin Baker fan club.

41:14.950 --> 41:17.475
Anybody want to enlighten
a confused old man?

41:17.605 --> 41:19.259
It's the ejection seat manufacturer.

41:19.389 --> 41:20.521
They saved my ass,
that's for sure.

41:20.652 --> 41:23.481
I'll stand for themany day.

41:23.611 --> 41:25.221
Well, that calls for a drink.

41:25.352 --> 41:27.180
Oh, come on, are you serious?
He's got a concussion.

41:27.310 --> 41:28.355
Well, we don't.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.530
Dad.

41:29.661 --> 41:33.055
All right, water for you two.

41:33.186 --> 41:34.361
Yeah.

41:34.492 --> 41:37.103
- Huh?
- Just a splash.

41:38.408 --> 41:39.627
Help you pour.

41:42.369 --> 41:45.851
To, um, three generations

41:45.981 --> 41:47.940
of badasses. Hmm?

41:48.070 --> 41:53.162
Now, sure, two of you
unenlightened souls

41:53.293 --> 41:56.470
went Navy, but we'll find
a way to forgive you.

41:56.601 --> 41:58.690
Hear, hear.

42:01.562 --> 42:04.913
Oh, Callen told me
something interesting...

42:05.044 --> 42:06.611
Sonic.

42:10.571 --> 42:12.704
Now, see, I'm confused again.

42:12.834 --> 42:14.662
Uh, it's my call
sign, Grandpop.

42:14.793 --> 42:16.446
Your squadron picks it for you,
usually after you've done

42:16.577 --> 42:18.144
something pretty stupid.

42:18.274 --> 42:19.711
Yeah, like, say illegally
breaking the sound barrier?

42:19.841 --> 42:20.407
Something like that?

42:20.538 --> 42:22.627
Well, let's just say that

42:22.757 --> 42:23.976
my plane wasn't the only thing

42:24.106 --> 42:25.673
that went supersonic that day.

42:25.804 --> 42:28.546
I have never seen my CO
use that many curse words.

42:29.895 --> 42:32.724
My boy. Yeah.
