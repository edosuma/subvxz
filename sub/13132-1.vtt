00:20.895 --> 00:22.294
You ready?

00:24.495 --> 00:26.645
Didn't think I'd be this nervous.

00:31.895 --> 00:33.692
Now or never.

00:39.295 --> 00:41.684
All right, <i>papi,</i> let's do this.

00:42.535 --> 00:44.207
He's over there.

00:54.335 --> 00:56.053
You must be Michael.

00:56.215 --> 00:59.252
Your friend Fernando tells me
you could use my services today.

00:59.415 --> 01:00.814
Very much so.

01:00.975 --> 01:04.172
And I assume that's the other half
of your team?

01:12.895 --> 01:14.567
You look beautiful.

01:15.935 --> 01:17.493
Thank you.

01:21.975 --> 01:24.443
It's my understanding you'd like
to keep this simple.

01:26.095 --> 01:29.007
We've never actually managed
to keep anything simple.

01:29.175 --> 01:30.210
You can try.

01:30.695 --> 01:33.528
Well, let's begin then, shall we?

01:34.095 --> 01:35.164
Family and friends...

01:35.335 --> 01:38.168
...we gather here
to celebrate the union...

01:38.335 --> 01:42.408
...between Michael Scofield
and Sara Tancredi.

02:12.655 --> 02:13.644
Oh, yeah, <i>papi.</i>

02:13.815 --> 02:16.932
This one has Puerto Rican blood
in her, I think. Look at her.

02:35.495 --> 02:37.053
Sorry to break up the party.

02:37.215 --> 02:39.524
- What is going on?
- We have an arrest warrant.

02:39.695 --> 02:42.812
- What?
- Talk to Agent Paul Kellerman in D.C.

02:42.975 --> 02:45.967
We settled this with the Feds.
We settled this weeks ago.

02:46.135 --> 02:48.365
- Sir, back up.
- We were exonerated.

02:48.535 --> 02:50.173
- Sir, back up.
- We were exonerated!

02:50.495 --> 02:52.884
We're not here for you.
We're here for her.

02:54.215 --> 02:56.649
She didn't do anything.
She wasn't involved.

02:56.815 --> 02:58.009
Don't make this escalate.

02:58.295 --> 03:01.571
Sara Tancredi, you're under arrest
for the murder of Christina Hampton.

03:02.135 --> 03:04.046
What? She didn't kill anyone.

03:04.215 --> 03:06.968
Funny. Surveillance-camera footage
says different.

03:09.135 --> 03:10.648
Michael.

03:11.455 --> 03:12.604
- Right this way.
- Michael.

03:12.775 --> 03:14.333
- Second car, please.
- Michael.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.133
- What's going on?
- Back up, please.

03:28.175 --> 03:29.847
They're not gonna let me see her.

03:30.015 --> 03:33.087
Why did Kellerman send you
if you can't do anything?

03:34.015 --> 03:35.971
They're trying to break both of you.

03:36.135 --> 03:38.603
Look, she has a constitutional right
to visitation.

03:38.775 --> 03:41.209
I'll draw up an order
and get it before a judge.

03:41.375 --> 03:43.172
Can you argue self-defense?

03:43.335 --> 03:44.563
How?

03:45.735 --> 03:48.169
Anything that might help her
is out of frame.

03:48.335 --> 03:51.771
Security camera only shows Sara
stepping up and firing at the victim.

03:52.495 --> 03:54.850
- Pull the trigger, Michael.
- Drop the gun.

03:55.615 --> 03:57.333
Misfire.

04:00.655 --> 04:02.532
- She worked for the Company.
- To you.

04:02.695 --> 04:05.255
To a jury,
she's Christina Hampton, consultant.

04:05.415 --> 04:09.124
Because she was so good at hiding her
true identity, we can't prove otherwise.

04:10.135 --> 04:13.605
Look, you were all exonerated.
It did not sit well with law enforcement.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.493
If they can make Sara pay, they will.

04:15.895 --> 04:17.851
How much time is she looking at?

04:19.575 --> 04:21.372
Twenty-five to life.

04:30.575 --> 04:32.884
<i>Ladies, Level 3.</i>

04:37.615 --> 04:40.573
You, over here.

04:42.295 --> 04:44.126
You, here.

04:46.855 --> 04:50.052
- You, here.
- That's right.

04:52.935 --> 04:53.924
This one's yours.

04:55.175 --> 04:57.370
Aren't I supposed to be
in a different facility?

04:57.535 --> 04:58.524
I don't think so.

04:58.695 --> 05:02.165
I haven't been convicted. I'm supposed
to be in a jail. This is prison.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.530
Overcrowding and budget cuts, fish.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.208
This is the jail.

05:06.375 --> 05:07.694
That's the prison.

05:07.855 --> 05:10.164
Just leave it there.

05:10.415 --> 05:12.565
<i>Code 99.</i>

05:16.935 --> 05:18.414
What's up, homey?

05:18.575 --> 05:19.974
You need some help?

05:23.535 --> 05:27.084
You got everything you need over there?
Why don't you go help make her bed.

05:28.375 --> 05:33.085
<i>Sergeant Malloy to rec room.</i>
<i>Sergeant Malloy to rec room.</i>

05:34.855 --> 05:36.174
Don't let them spook you.

05:36.815 --> 05:39.409
- They just like to intimidate.
- They're good at it.

05:40.175 --> 05:44.327
Look, this jail-prison hybrid thing
is B.S.

05:45.855 --> 05:46.844
Come on.

05:47.015 --> 05:48.607
The other one's practically empty.

05:48.775 --> 05:51.164
You can ride it out
till your court date there.

05:51.495 --> 05:52.484
Which one?

05:52.655 --> 05:53.644
Thank you.

06:11.415 --> 06:14.213
Here. This should be
a little bit more comfortable for you.

06:14.375 --> 06:15.933
Okay.

06:22.255 --> 06:23.324
What's going on?

06:24.895 --> 06:27.773
You know, at first...

06:27.935 --> 06:29.414
...I couldn't place your name.

06:29.575 --> 06:31.167
Tancredi.

06:31.335 --> 06:32.768
It sounded so familiar.

06:33.455 --> 06:35.173
Then Hucks here, figured it out.

06:35.895 --> 06:39.012
I remembered your pretty face
from the papers.

06:40.975 --> 06:43.170
You're not going anywhere, fish.

06:43.335 --> 06:44.450
This is gonna happen.

06:44.615 --> 06:48.449
Half a dozen guards
lost their jobs and pensions at Fox River.

06:48.615 --> 06:51.209
Another dozen were put on probation
after you decided...

06:51.375 --> 06:54.572
...to leave a door open for your boyfriend
and his seven convict pals.

06:54.735 --> 06:58.091
And we ain't gonna let anything like that
happen again.

06:59.535 --> 07:02.845
No. Come here, honey.

07:03.015 --> 07:05.131
Don't worry,
we won't hit the baby basket.

07:05.935 --> 07:07.653
- Yeah.
- Look at her.

07:08.495 --> 07:09.723
That's right.

07:33.575 --> 07:36.885
It look like that welcome wagon
ran over your face.

07:37.055 --> 07:38.693
It looks that way, huh?

07:39.895 --> 07:43.490
I just came by
to help you get adjusted.

07:43.695 --> 07:46.129
If you need something,
I know all these guards.

07:47.655 --> 07:48.929
Most of them owe me.

07:49.455 --> 07:52.811
I appreciate that,
but I can take care of myself.

07:54.135 --> 07:55.363
My bad.

07:55.535 --> 07:58.652
I don't know what made me think
you couldn't take care of yourself.

08:00.895 --> 08:03.489
All right, well, you need something,
you just ask for me.

08:04.215 --> 08:06.775
Everybody calls me Daddy.

08:33.695 --> 08:35.491
Special delivery.

08:38.215 --> 08:41.809
You know, all we need is a little cash
to spread around the place.

08:41.975 --> 08:44.853
I told you,
the government's frozen my assets.

08:46.255 --> 08:48.894
You telling me
you can't get your hands on any cash?

08:49.615 --> 08:51.207
That's the least you could do...

08:51.375 --> 08:54.048
...considering you was gonna kill me
not too long ago.

08:54.215 --> 08:56.251
Goodbye, Theodore.

08:59.295 --> 09:01.206
You ain't ever been
incarcerated before...

09:01.375 --> 09:03.889
...and I ain't ever been
incarcerated here before.

09:04.055 --> 09:05.852
Let's just say this handicapped con...

09:06.015 --> 09:09.087
...ain't got the juice he had
back in Fox River.

09:10.135 --> 09:14.845
Your pathetic existence here
could be ameliorated as can my life...

09:16.615 --> 09:18.571
...all with a little Roberto <i>dinero.</i>

09:18.735 --> 09:22.808
One of our friends has been apprehended
by the authorities.

09:25.015 --> 09:27.449
Looks like we've got a new neighbor.

09:28.135 --> 09:31.172
I'm never gonna get out
of this prison alive, I know that.

09:31.335 --> 09:34.213
I wanna bring my enemy down
with me.

09:34.495 --> 09:36.372
I want her dead.

09:44.135 --> 09:48.174
Either way, it's gonna require capital.
Capital you no longer have.

09:48.335 --> 09:51.327
My rainy-day fund.
You know where it is.

09:51.495 --> 09:54.487
Jonathan, I'd assume that
that would be used for your defense.

09:54.655 --> 09:56.407
It's good money after bad, Joe.

09:56.575 --> 10:00.887
They're not gonna let me out of here
no matter how many shysters I hire.

10:02.735 --> 10:07.684
Get that to our friend in sister cells
across the compound.

10:58.215 --> 10:59.933
Excuse me.

11:02.215 --> 11:03.807
Bad move.

11:06.655 --> 11:09.567
Last time someone touched her,
they got a cracked kneecap.

11:29.135 --> 11:31.285
You're much braver
than I give you credit for.

11:31.615 --> 11:35.324
- Either that or you're amazingly naÃ¯ve.
- Do I look like I wanna talk to you?

11:35.495 --> 11:39.454
Just saying a women in your position
would opt for some protection.

11:39.615 --> 11:43.927
- Join a prison gang? I don't think so.
- It's not a gang, you know.

11:44.215 --> 11:45.204
A family.

11:46.975 --> 11:48.966
They don't call her Daddy for nothing.

11:51.295 --> 11:52.933
That's her wife.

11:53.455 --> 11:54.570
And those are her kids.

12:00.895 --> 12:01.930
Are you okay?

12:02.095 --> 12:04.165
Stay the hell away from me.

12:05.335 --> 12:08.566
- I need to go to the infirmary.
- Can't go without a release form.

12:08.735 --> 12:12.364
I'm having muscle contractions
in my throat and my jaw's tightening up.

12:12.535 --> 12:14.765
It's strychnine ingestion,
it's rat poison.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.812
That's government cheese,
get used to it.

12:16.975 --> 12:21.253
If I don't get to the hospital the next 15
minutes, I will die and my baby will die.

12:21.415 --> 12:23.007
Please.

12:23.375 --> 12:26.447
Bo, why don't you let her go
see the doc?

12:31.615 --> 12:33.128
Please.

12:34.415 --> 12:37.851
This is Cowler. We have an inmate
going to the infirmary.

12:44.975 --> 12:47.853
We were able to administer
the charcoal lavage in time.

12:48.015 --> 12:50.575
You and your baby are gonna be okay.

12:52.015 --> 12:54.973
The strychnine didn't get in my meat loaf
all by itself, right?

12:55.255 --> 12:57.644
Well, then you need to talk
to the warden about it.

13:01.055 --> 13:03.125
Then how about talking to me
about your face?

13:03.295 --> 13:05.047
You wanna tell me
how that happened?

13:06.815 --> 13:09.045
I caught an elbow playing basketball.

13:11.415 --> 13:14.293
We should discuss your situation.

13:14.455 --> 13:18.004
I'm sure you've ascertained, this isn't
gonna be a run-of-the-mill pregnancy.

13:18.175 --> 13:19.767
- Do I deliver in here?
- No.

13:19.935 --> 13:22.768
The day we induce,
we'll secure you in an ambulance.

13:22.935 --> 13:26.132
Take you to Saint Lucia down the road.
We'll cordon off a room.

13:26.295 --> 13:28.684
There'll be three armed guards
when you give birth.

13:29.055 --> 13:31.285
Do I get to see my baby?

13:31.455 --> 13:33.332
You'll have 30 minutes
before we take it.

13:37.255 --> 13:39.007
I've seen this process a dozen times.

13:39.575 --> 13:42.772
After the mothers come back here,
the depression's almost unbearable.

13:42.935 --> 13:44.050
My advice...

13:44.535 --> 13:47.572
...it's less messy, if you just think
of yourself as a surrogate.

13:59.495 --> 14:00.814
Yeah?

14:00.975 --> 14:02.533
Michael, it's Blue Phillips.

14:02.695 --> 14:06.051
Listen,
your wife had an incident earlier today.

14:06.215 --> 14:07.489
Someone tried to poison her.

14:08.335 --> 14:11.054
- What are you talking about?
- Michael, I need you to focus.

14:11.215 --> 14:13.331
<i>Do you have any idea</i>
<i>who might've done...?</i>

14:13.495 --> 14:14.928
Michael?

14:15.335 --> 14:16.814
Michael.

14:17.855 --> 14:19.686
All right, let him in.

14:30.175 --> 14:33.724
If I had a list of all the people
who might come to visit me...

14:33.895 --> 14:36.409
...your name would be at the bottom,
somewhere below...

14:36.575 --> 14:38.725
...Jesus Christ and Scooby-Doo.

14:38.895 --> 14:40.647
Someone tried to poison Sara today.

14:41.095 --> 14:42.084
Mercy.

14:42.255 --> 14:44.849
Only you would be depraved enough...

14:45.015 --> 14:48.052
...to think that killing an innocent
woman and her unborn child...

14:48.215 --> 14:51.207
...would bring you some kind of peace,
before your execution.

14:51.375 --> 14:54.173
Sara is with child?

14:54.335 --> 14:56.053
Congratulations.

14:56.215 --> 14:59.127
This is like the 4th of July
and Christmas rolled into one.

14:59.295 --> 15:04.323
I'm asking you, father to father,
to leave her alone.

15:04.895 --> 15:08.808
You can kill me if you wanna kill me.
I'll trade my life for hers.

15:08.975 --> 15:10.294
But leave Sara alone.

15:10.615 --> 15:12.287
Michael...

15:13.215 --> 15:16.844
...if you were killed,
your pain would last a moment.

15:17.215 --> 15:21.447
If Sara were killed,
your pain would last the rest of your life.

15:21.855 --> 15:26.451
Now, that's got to be appealing
to whoever put out this hit.

15:26.615 --> 15:28.253
But don't worry, Michael...

15:28.415 --> 15:31.725
...if I find out anything,
I'll be sure to let you know.

15:34.535 --> 15:35.968
Prison life can be tough.

15:36.135 --> 15:39.207
I remember you have two missing toes
that can attest to that fact.

15:39.375 --> 15:41.889
I don't think you understand.
She's not safe here!

15:42.775 --> 15:44.288
Please.

15:44.855 --> 15:47.244
Please just approve the transfer
to another facility.

15:47.415 --> 15:49.406
If I grant her,
everybody's gonna want one.

15:49.575 --> 15:51.088
What about segregated housing?

15:51.255 --> 15:54.725
Is there something I should know about
the structural integrity of the SHU?

15:54.895 --> 15:58.604
- Right. I could see where this is going.
- I know who you are.

15:58.775 --> 16:01.448
And I'm not gonna let you turn
my prison into Fox River.

16:01.615 --> 16:04.527
All I'm trying to do
is keep my wife alive.

16:04.695 --> 16:06.765
You do know she's pregnant?

16:07.255 --> 16:09.132
I don't care.

16:23.135 --> 16:24.693
Here.

16:25.175 --> 16:27.370
- Thanks.
- In case I haven't made myself clear...

16:27.535 --> 16:31.130
...Sara Tancredi is not getting
any preferential treatment.

16:31.295 --> 16:33.684
No, you've made yourself
perfectly clear.

16:33.855 --> 16:35.766
Thank you for your time.

16:39.975 --> 16:40.964
What happened?

16:41.135 --> 16:44.127
The general wants Sara dead
and the warden's gonna let it happen.

16:44.295 --> 16:46.684
We got a lawyer on the case.
He's gonna get her out.

16:46.855 --> 16:48.174
There's not enough time.

16:48.335 --> 16:50.690
She stays in that prison,
someone's gonna kill her.

16:51.015 --> 16:53.165
I guess we don't have a choice.

16:56.175 --> 16:58.006
We're breaking her out.

17:05.935 --> 17:07.971
In my 16 years in the bureau...

17:08.135 --> 17:11.570
...I've worked cases
under 43 different agents.

17:12.175 --> 17:17.852
Alexander Mahone
is the smartest, bravest...

17:18.015 --> 17:21.132
...most honorable man I've ever had
the pleasure of serving with.

17:21.295 --> 17:26.847
Well, as one of those 43 agents,
I can't help but feel a bit offended...

17:27.015 --> 17:31.611
...because, obviously I am not as
honored as this drug-addicted murderer.

17:31.895 --> 17:34.614
Alex has been clean and sober
for four months.

17:34.775 --> 17:39.053
And he's been completely exonerated of
all crimes associated with the Company.

17:39.215 --> 17:42.446
That doesn't include the shooting
and murder of one Oscar Shales...

17:42.615 --> 17:44.810
...and burying his body
under the birdbath.

17:44.975 --> 17:46.806
That is just an allegation.

17:46.975 --> 17:48.203
Let's move on, shall we?

17:48.375 --> 17:50.889
All those in favor of reinstating
Alexander Mahone...

17:51.055 --> 17:54.411
...as special agent
in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

17:54.575 --> 17:55.769
Aye.

17:58.495 --> 18:01.168
- All those opposed...?
- All right, all right.

18:03.615 --> 18:05.207
Well...

18:06.815 --> 18:08.294
Thank you for the invite.

18:11.335 --> 18:13.246
It's always a pleasure.

18:15.015 --> 18:17.688
You know, Alex,
this ruling can be revisited...

18:18.255 --> 18:20.530
...if you were able
to sufficiently demonstrate...

18:20.695 --> 18:23.334
...just how committed you are
to a life of service.

18:23.655 --> 18:27.125
Now, as you may know,
Sara Tancredi was arrested recently...

18:27.295 --> 18:30.844
...and is currently being housed
at the Miami-Dade State Penitentiary.

18:31.015 --> 18:34.052
We have concerns that Michael Scofield
may have plans for her.

18:35.735 --> 18:39.853
So this...
This is why you invite me in here.

18:40.015 --> 18:42.575
Well, obviously,
if Scofield were to be able...

18:42.735 --> 18:45.044
...to pull off this plot
of another breakout...

18:45.215 --> 18:48.127
...the public embarrassment
would be immense to the bureau.

18:48.295 --> 18:51.571
So having someone to get us
credible information...

18:51.735 --> 18:53.691
...that would be worth something
to us.

18:53.855 --> 18:56.608
Agent Wheatley is set up in Miami.
He would be your contact.

18:56.775 --> 18:58.811
You're something else.

19:07.055 --> 19:12.129
Now, we both know
how badly you want that badge back.

19:13.535 --> 19:16.003
Give me a reason to give it to you.

19:17.055 --> 19:18.886
What's your plan
after we break her out?

19:19.055 --> 19:21.011
- We on the run again?
- First thing's first.

19:21.175 --> 19:23.052
- Let's get her out of there.
- Hey, <i>papi.</i>

19:23.215 --> 19:26.446
The Fed that arrested Sara?
He's outside staking us out.

19:27.895 --> 19:30.614
Look, if you're worried
about getting into trouble again...

19:30.775 --> 19:32.845
...go back to Chicago.
Go back to your family.

19:33.015 --> 19:34.130
I'll understand.

19:34.295 --> 19:35.284
Are you kidding me?

19:35.455 --> 19:38.527
After all we been through, I'm gonna
leave you here and Sara there?

19:38.695 --> 19:41.892
Shut up and don't bring it up again.
What's all that?

19:42.055 --> 19:43.204
Newspaper clippings.

19:43.375 --> 19:45.889
Covering seven different
escape attempts...

19:46.055 --> 19:48.444
...from Miami-Dade State Pen,
over the last 60 years.

19:48.615 --> 19:51.368
None of them...
None of them successful.

19:51.655 --> 19:54.044
So we read them all
and we learn what not to do.

19:54.215 --> 19:57.651
The prison officials learned a lot.
They re-evaluated, they retrofitted.

19:57.815 --> 20:00.204
The prison's practically escape-proof.

20:00.375 --> 20:02.525
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

20:03.375 --> 20:06.333
Okay, so if we can't go through,
what if we go down?

20:06.495 --> 20:08.690
Like, down into the prison.
We parachute in.

20:09.335 --> 20:10.734
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:10.895 --> 20:12.613
- Find her, get out.
- Are you kidding?

20:12.775 --> 20:14.652
- I'm serious.
- That's suicide.

20:14.815 --> 20:17.807
Hey, hey. Newspaper clippings
are only gonna get us so far.

20:17.975 --> 20:21.411
We need some more information about
the prison. Let's do some recon work.

20:23.135 --> 20:25.365
Camera, tape measure, dry ice.
What's this?

20:25.655 --> 20:27.008
It's a shopping list.

20:32.215 --> 20:33.614
You need to come with me, doc.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.845
I have a doctor's appointment
for my pregnancy.

20:36.015 --> 20:37.573
It'll wait.

20:38.535 --> 20:39.524
In there.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.048
Hold it.

20:52.735 --> 20:55.454
I don't know what you want,
but I will go down fighting.

20:56.175 --> 20:58.006
Damn, baby, I ain't gonna hurt you.

20:59.695 --> 21:01.128
I ain't even gonna touch you.

21:06.175 --> 21:08.973
See, I run the motor-pool detail
in here.

21:09.135 --> 21:12.013
I was thinking, if you wanna
get yourself a little fresh air...

21:12.175 --> 21:14.894
...and not have to worry
about getting stuck in the back...

21:15.055 --> 21:18.172
...then you can come
and work with me.

22:11.335 --> 22:12.814
You're the Fed from my wedding.

22:12.975 --> 22:15.694
- Call me Agent Wheatley.
- I could call you a lot of things.

22:15.855 --> 22:17.208
- Where you headed?
- Sea World.

22:17.375 --> 22:19.605
- Sea World. There isn't one in Miami.
- My loss.

22:19.775 --> 22:23.609
No. What'd be your loss is getting your
wife killed by doing something stupid.

22:23.975 --> 22:26.569
- Are you threatening Sara?
- No, no. Not at all.

22:26.735 --> 22:29.454
I'm saying if you were gonna try
and revoke her sentence...

22:29.615 --> 22:32.766
...bullets fly, Michael. If she were
to get hurt, that'd be on you.

22:32.935 --> 22:35.688
Funny hearing that from the guy
who put her in prison.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.449
No, I didn't put her in prison.
The state of Florida did.

22:38.615 --> 22:40.890
It's my job to make sure
that she stays there.

22:41.655 --> 22:44.886
So where's all your little buddies?

22:50.735 --> 22:53.374
All right. Drop in more dry ice.

23:08.455 --> 23:12.334
Fence line is 4 feet from the road.

23:18.175 --> 23:21.531
Thirty-two feet from the east camera.

23:21.815 --> 23:23.567
Hurry up. They're gonna see our laser.

23:23.935 --> 23:25.732
Going as fast as I can, <i>papi.</i>

23:29.775 --> 23:30.764
He follow you?

23:30.935 --> 23:32.573
Yeah, but he's gone now.

23:32.735 --> 23:33.770
You guys almost done?

23:35.335 --> 23:36.654
- Almost.
- <i>Great.</i>

23:37.575 --> 23:39.805
I'll meet you back at the loft.

23:58.735 --> 24:00.054
Well, you just a natural.

24:02.135 --> 24:04.933
I bet you was a hell of a surgeon.

24:06.095 --> 24:09.087
Handing out condoms to cons
don't make you no damn surgeon.

24:09.255 --> 24:12.292
- What in the hell is the matter with you?
- You ain't even ask me...

24:12.455 --> 24:13.888
One day. For real.

24:14.055 --> 24:16.728
Can we go one day
without your mouth? One.

24:20.455 --> 24:22.093
Let it be today.

24:27.815 --> 24:31.694
I'm sorry.
You gotta forgive my old lady. She...

24:32.015 --> 24:34.165
You just a little bit easy on the eyes.

24:35.055 --> 24:37.615
And she's just a jealous type,
you know, so...

24:37.775 --> 24:39.288
Crazy type is more like it.

24:40.695 --> 24:42.492
What?
You wanna watch your tone, Agatha.

24:42.895 --> 24:45.853
- Sorry.
- Or you want me to take off my belt?

24:46.255 --> 24:47.688
Sorry.

24:50.935 --> 24:52.573
Kids.

24:54.575 --> 24:57.612
It's rough. It's hard running a family.

24:58.935 --> 25:01.051
It's important though that...

25:01.775 --> 25:02.844
That you have one.

25:03.935 --> 25:05.687
I have a family. I have a husband.

25:05.855 --> 25:08.130
Oh, you got a husband? Is he here?

25:09.095 --> 25:11.768
They let them bring you in here
with you when you came?

25:12.815 --> 25:14.134
No.

25:14.695 --> 25:16.492
Yeah, I had a husband too.

25:19.175 --> 25:21.928
Eighteen years is a long time to wait.

25:24.975 --> 25:27.808
So, you know, if this ain't for you...

25:28.255 --> 25:29.574
...that's cool.

25:33.295 --> 25:36.093
Then you pick up that nasty oil
and take it out...

25:36.255 --> 25:37.813
...and put it in the repository.

25:38.335 --> 25:39.734
Okay.

26:07.695 --> 26:09.890
We gotta go, bro.

26:10.335 --> 26:11.927
It's okay, just stop your crying.

26:15.735 --> 26:18.807
- Get your hands off me.
- When I'm good and ready.

26:19.135 --> 26:21.171
What's Burrows doing by the fence?

26:30.175 --> 26:32.973
Please don't make me
ask you again, Sara.

26:44.175 --> 26:48.612
Nobody here to help you but yourself.
Are you gonna answer me?

26:48.775 --> 26:50.174
You tried to kill me.

26:50.615 --> 26:53.209
Line it up, cons. Back inside.

26:53.375 --> 26:56.253
You, get back to your detail now.

27:04.175 --> 27:05.927
Right over here, baby.

27:15.855 --> 27:18.085
I want you to pass along
an offer to your boy.

27:18.535 --> 27:22.448
What he's paying his people to dust
that Tancredi chick in bitch pop...

27:22.615 --> 27:24.526
...my woman'll do it for a cut rate.

27:26.455 --> 27:28.923
Just what kind of discount
are you proposing here?

27:29.695 --> 27:32.732
Tell him
if he's offering a hundred grand...

27:32.895 --> 27:34.214
...my girl will take 30.

27:35.215 --> 27:36.694
No, 40.

27:36.855 --> 27:37.970
Forty.

27:38.735 --> 27:40.373
Perfect.

27:40.855 --> 27:41.844
I'll tell him.

27:47.815 --> 27:49.294
Hey, five star.

27:52.215 --> 27:54.854
So you have no cash...

27:55.335 --> 27:56.324
...whatsoever?

27:57.535 --> 27:58.968
I'm sorry.

27:59.135 --> 28:03.048
I couldn't hear you over the sound
of that broken record.

28:07.375 --> 28:08.933
Got it.

28:10.775 --> 28:12.766
I won't ask again.

28:18.975 --> 28:20.966
He was acting stupid as you look.

28:23.655 --> 28:25.930
Oh, to what do we owe the honor?

28:26.495 --> 28:27.894
I've been thinking.

28:28.055 --> 28:31.843
Well, no need to be shy.
Just spit it out.

28:33.175 --> 28:34.767
- Changed my mind.
- Yeah, well...

28:34.935 --> 28:36.414
...maybe Daddy changed her mind.

28:38.175 --> 28:39.927
Maybe she don't want you here
anymore.

28:40.095 --> 28:41.323
Squirt's right.

28:41.495 --> 28:44.248
I recently have rolled up
my welcome mat.

28:44.415 --> 28:45.973
Peace.

28:52.175 --> 28:53.449
Please.

28:53.615 --> 28:55.253
Please what?

28:57.135 --> 28:59.808
Please may I be a part of your family?

29:02.735 --> 29:04.327
Take a walk.

29:04.975 --> 29:06.169
Take a walk.

29:12.455 --> 29:15.606
I would love that. I would...
Sit down. I really would.

29:16.175 --> 29:18.973
But see, it's not that easy...

29:19.135 --> 29:21.524
...as just saying "I do."

29:24.055 --> 29:25.852
See, you're making a commitment...

29:26.495 --> 29:27.610
...to a family.

29:35.975 --> 29:38.170
It's something you gotta prove.

29:38.775 --> 29:41.084
That's right. We all did it.

29:49.215 --> 29:52.810
It's a commitment to the family coat.

29:55.095 --> 29:57.370
It's a coat you gotta wear.

30:16.775 --> 30:18.811
- Alex.
- Hey.

30:18.975 --> 30:20.806
- What's up?
- Hey, Sucre.

30:20.975 --> 30:23.773
- How you doing, man?
- What's going on?

30:24.295 --> 30:25.284
We gotta talk.

30:26.695 --> 30:27.684
All right.

30:28.375 --> 30:29.410
They're watching you.

30:29.895 --> 30:32.967
- We know. We got a Fed on us.
- No. Not just one.

30:33.135 --> 30:34.170
The whole department.

30:34.335 --> 30:36.895
Sounds a lot like inside information,
Alex.

30:37.175 --> 30:39.245
What'd you do,
make a deal with the Feds?

30:41.015 --> 30:43.973
They offered me my job back,
if I came down here to spy on you.

30:44.975 --> 30:47.205
The Fed you're talking
about is Wheatley.

30:47.375 --> 30:49.684
- He's running point.
- So now we know.

30:49.855 --> 30:52.085
So if you're really gonna do this...

30:52.455 --> 30:53.604
...you gotta do it right.

30:54.735 --> 30:56.851
And I'll help you if you need me.

30:59.535 --> 31:00.763
What else did you get?

31:00.935 --> 31:04.052
Sara was working motor pool today
at 4:00.

31:04.215 --> 31:05.284
Motor pool is here.

31:05.455 --> 31:08.527
Visible by two security cameras,
along the perimeter of the prison.

31:08.695 --> 31:12.734
- What about secondary entrances?
- No loading dock, no personnel entrance.

31:12.895 --> 31:16.285
- Fences?
- Fifteen feet high, covered in razor wire.

31:16.455 --> 31:18.366
- Electrified?
- No, why?

31:18.535 --> 31:21.095
If Sara can get herself back
to motor pool...

31:21.255 --> 31:22.847
...we can find our way inside.

31:24.015 --> 31:26.404
With al the retrofits,
the fence line was widened...

31:26.575 --> 31:29.612
...but security cameras remain
exactly where they've always been.

31:29.775 --> 31:32.243
- Never accounted for the difference.
- A blind spot.

31:32.695 --> 31:33.764
Yeah.

31:33.935 --> 31:37.291
Right here. If Sara can get back
to that spot, we can breach the fence.

31:37.455 --> 31:38.524
It's risky, Michael.

31:39.055 --> 31:42.286
It's all we've got. We have to tell
Sara where we're gonna meet her.

31:42.455 --> 31:45.094
How? We get no visitation,
no phone calls.

31:52.775 --> 31:54.925
It's clean. Take it to Tancredi.

32:16.175 --> 32:18.291
<i>Remember when I taught you</i>
<i>about flowers.</i>

32:18.455 --> 32:20.252
<i>I wish I was with you now...</i>

32:20.415 --> 32:22.645
<i>...to see you holding one in your hand.</i>

32:28.015 --> 32:30.051
<i>To see you holding one in your hand.</i>

32:45.855 --> 32:48.847
<i>Tomorrow, p.m., 7. Oil dump.</i>

33:09.295 --> 33:12.412
- Looks like you've been busy.
- You have a warrant, Agent Wheatley?

33:12.855 --> 33:14.527
A warrant? No, I don't need one.

33:14.695 --> 33:18.244
My testimony will be
that your brother let me in, once inside...

33:18.415 --> 33:21.327
...saw all this evidence,
right in plain sight.

33:21.495 --> 33:23.451
What judge is gonna take your word?

33:23.615 --> 33:26.527
What evidence? Those pictures
were taken from public property.

33:26.695 --> 33:29.414
That prison was paid for
by the taxpayers.

33:29.575 --> 33:32.373
So all you have evidence of
is an exonerated citizen...

33:32.535 --> 33:36.084
...standing on a public road taking
pictures of a public building.

33:36.255 --> 33:38.052
Last I checked, it's not a crime.

33:38.215 --> 33:40.126
What if I said I could get you
on attempt?

33:40.295 --> 33:41.728
Just for having all this stuff.

33:41.895 --> 33:44.853
What if I told you that all of this
was a peace offering?

33:45.015 --> 33:47.370
The warden
won't let me see my wife.

33:47.535 --> 33:49.890
So I figured if
I found a few lapses in security...

33:50.055 --> 33:53.365
...pointing them as a gesture of good
faith, she might change her mind.

33:53.535 --> 33:55.014
Is that so?

33:55.175 --> 33:58.485
- You find anything yet?
- Nope. Looks airtight.

33:58.655 --> 34:00.247
You sure about that?

34:00.535 --> 34:04.244
Nothing that some scumbag
can exploit?

34:05.735 --> 34:07.009
Airtight.

34:07.175 --> 34:08.654
Well, thank goodness for that.

34:09.415 --> 34:11.770
But you guys will let me know
if anything comes up.

34:11.935 --> 34:13.527
You'll be the first to know.

34:16.534 --> 34:17.524
I won't keep you.

34:30.175 --> 34:32.643
On the outside I was known
for getting the job done...

34:32.815 --> 34:33.884
...no matter what.

34:34.054 --> 34:35.329
I got paid well for it.

34:35.815 --> 34:37.407
Now I'm broke.

34:37.574 --> 34:38.974
But I still need things.

34:39.135 --> 34:40.534
Like what?

34:40.695 --> 34:43.846
- A favor.
- I don't do favors for cons.

34:44.014 --> 34:45.004
Really?

34:45.175 --> 34:47.370
That's not what it says
on the bathroom wall.

34:47.534 --> 34:49.014
As I understand it...

34:49.175 --> 34:52.246
...you do favors
for those who reciprocate.

34:55.815 --> 34:57.089
Is that true?

35:03.855 --> 35:04.924
Hey.

35:05.095 --> 35:06.414
This is bush league, boss.

35:07.735 --> 35:09.168
I'm a vet around here!

35:09.335 --> 35:11.087
You... I...

35:11.255 --> 35:13.450
Ain't no reason to toss me!

35:13.615 --> 35:15.333
You... Hey!

35:15.495 --> 35:16.530
You know me!

35:20.255 --> 35:21.608
Lookie, lookie here.

35:21.775 --> 35:24.130
No. That brown ain't mine,
boss, you know this.

35:24.295 --> 35:26.172
I don't do no drugs.

35:26.335 --> 35:27.893
Who put that in here?

35:29.215 --> 35:30.204
You...

35:30.375 --> 35:33.014
Get your hands off me.
I know where the hole is.

35:33.175 --> 35:34.767
What you looking at?

35:35.135 --> 35:36.773
I don't do no drugs.

35:39.295 --> 35:41.013
Somebody's going down for this.

35:41.255 --> 35:42.688
I love you too.

35:43.775 --> 35:45.925
Sofia's making arrangements
in Central America.

35:46.095 --> 35:49.167
Once we break Sara out,
we're on a boat, and we're gone.

35:50.735 --> 35:51.963
- Hey.
- It's Blue.

35:52.135 --> 35:53.614
Got the decision from the court.

35:53.775 --> 35:56.972
They're ordering the warden
to allow supervised visitation.

35:58.855 --> 36:01.847
- Where you going?
- They're letting me see Sara.

36:03.335 --> 36:06.054
They're gonna be listening.
You gotta be careful.

36:06.215 --> 36:08.934
If she understood my letter,
she'll find a way to tell me.

36:09.295 --> 36:11.763
How?
She gonna blink Morse code?

36:28.055 --> 36:34.494
<i>Attention all inmates. Visiting hours</i>
<i>will be over in five minutes.</i>

36:36.855 --> 36:38.129
Oh, my God.

36:42.055 --> 36:43.773
Oh, my God.

36:44.095 --> 36:46.245
- Who did this to you?
- I'm okay.

36:46.415 --> 36:49.452
- Baby's okay.
- Sara, I'm so sorry.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.684
You're in here because of me.

36:55.975 --> 36:58.205
I'm sorry, it's just hard.

36:59.695 --> 37:02.732
- <i>I miss you so much.</i>
- No touching.

37:04.935 --> 37:06.334
<i>I miss you too.</i>

37:08.335 --> 37:10.485
We just have to hang in there, okay?

37:12.095 --> 37:14.928
I'm trying, but my protection's gone.

37:17.535 --> 37:18.934
Did you get my letter?

37:19.615 --> 37:20.809
I did.

37:20.975 --> 37:24.763
I know sometimes it's hard for me
to express what I wanna say...

37:24.935 --> 37:29.247
...but I hope you understood
what I meant to tell you.

37:29.615 --> 37:31.094
I did.

37:33.815 --> 37:35.294
Is he getting cute?

37:35.895 --> 37:37.772
You were there for me.

37:38.015 --> 37:40.245
I will be there for you.

37:41.135 --> 37:42.329
Okay.

37:42.495 --> 37:44.087
All right, that's it.

37:44.735 --> 37:46.407
Time's up.

37:47.815 --> 37:49.453
See you soon.

37:55.575 --> 37:57.133
Bye.

38:09.935 --> 38:11.971
<i>Attention all...</i>

38:14.135 --> 38:15.887
<i>Please proceed immediately</i>
<i>to the unit.</i>

38:16.055 --> 38:17.283
Michael.

38:21.135 --> 38:25.128
I was thinking a lot about the photos and
the mock-up you showed me at the loft.

38:25.295 --> 38:26.774
And I ran a few tests.

38:26.935 --> 38:29.608
Lo and behold, I found a blind spot.

38:29.775 --> 38:32.573
Right along the fence line over here,
due to a retrofit.

38:33.175 --> 38:35.166
You didn't know about this, did you?

38:35.335 --> 38:36.370
No.

38:36.535 --> 38:40.164
No, because you would've told me
or the warden about it if you did, right?

38:40.615 --> 38:42.890
Well, it's a good thing I found this
when I did...

38:43.055 --> 38:45.285
...before anyone tried to escape.

38:45.455 --> 38:46.934
Coming in.

38:57.975 --> 39:01.251
Well, if we can't go through the fence,
then that leaves under or over.

39:01.415 --> 39:04.088
How's she gonna climb
that fence without being seen, huh?

39:04.255 --> 39:07.133
I'm guessing there's no telephone
wire for her to climb across.

39:07.295 --> 39:08.523
Then she's gotta go under.

39:08.695 --> 39:10.287
All right, let's get some shovels.

39:10.455 --> 39:12.525
What's that you were saying
about parachutes?

39:12.695 --> 39:13.889
Parachutes?

39:14.055 --> 39:15.283
Guys, come on.

39:15.455 --> 39:18.288
- You can't be s... Parachutes?
- A couple of thoughts on that.

39:18.455 --> 39:21.333
A, we don't have a plane.
B, we don't have a pilot.

39:21.495 --> 39:23.690
- Have you ever worn a parachute?
- Don't worry.

39:23.855 --> 39:25.732
I think I've got a plan.

39:25.895 --> 39:28.045
We're gonna need some help
from an old friend.

39:28.535 --> 39:29.684
Who?

39:29.855 --> 39:32.085
You want a favor from me?

39:32.255 --> 39:33.324
Just hear me out.

39:33.495 --> 39:37.374
Of course. I mean, when you and
Michael sent me back to that prison...

39:37.535 --> 39:39.526
...you did give me the piece
of chewing gum.

39:39.695 --> 39:42.368
What kind of man would I be
if I didn't quid your pro quo.

39:42.535 --> 39:46.164
Look, all you gotta do
is set off the fire alarm in here.

39:46.335 --> 39:47.688
Tomorrow night, at 7:30.

39:49.335 --> 39:50.370
That's it.

39:50.655 --> 39:52.486
You're breaking her out.

39:52.655 --> 39:54.532
Krantz has put a hit on her.

39:54.695 --> 39:56.811
It's our one shot...

39:57.415 --> 39:59.087
...of keeping her alive.

39:59.255 --> 40:01.644
Well, you're in a pickle covered in jam,
Lincoln.

40:01.815 --> 40:04.693
We'll put 5 grand in your kit
once this whole thing jumps off.

40:05.415 --> 40:08.771
The love of Michael's life,
that's only worth $5000?

40:08.935 --> 40:10.607
That's the best we can do.

40:10.935 --> 40:13.449
- I need six figures.
- That's all we got.

40:13.615 --> 40:16.766
Well, lucky day for you,
I know somebody who does.

40:16.935 --> 40:18.084
The general's man.

40:20.375 --> 40:23.253
He's got the payout for Sara's hit.

40:23.575 --> 40:27.011
You wire that money to me
by <i>7 p.m. tomorrow...</i>

40:27.175 --> 40:29.735
...and we're in business.
- What's his name?

40:29.895 --> 40:32.853
- Get your brother to use that noggin.
- You gotta give more.

40:33.015 --> 40:35.483
Tomorrow at <i>7 p.m. Go on, fetch.</i>

40:52.775 --> 40:54.686
You're a tough girl to get alone.

40:54.855 --> 40:57.574
I know he's breaking you out.
I'm coming with you.

41:03.775 --> 41:05.208
Relax.

41:05.375 --> 41:06.774
Krantz sent me to kill you...

41:06.935 --> 41:09.130
...but after what he's put me through,
I'm done.

41:09.295 --> 41:11.092
You were next to me
when I was poisoned.

41:11.255 --> 41:14.247
You think you would've lasted
this long if I wanted you dead?

41:14.415 --> 41:15.814
I want you dead. You're alive.

41:15.975 --> 41:18.773
It's hard to stay alive when you know
who's coming after you.

41:18.935 --> 41:21.449
There's 200 women in this prison.

41:21.855 --> 41:24.289
Could you even get out of gen pop?

41:28.495 --> 41:29.689
I'm coming with you...

41:30.575 --> 41:32.293
...or nobody's going.

41:58.815 --> 42:00.487
You should've seen Michael's face...

42:00.655 --> 42:03.453
...when he saw me fixing that fence,
installing that camera.

42:05.015 --> 42:06.892
You did a great job.

42:07.495 --> 42:09.725
Well, the job's over now.

42:10.095 --> 42:15.215
If Michael has this misguided belief
that Sara's life is in danger...

42:15.375 --> 42:17.525
...he's gonna find a way back
into that prison.

42:17.695 --> 42:21.688
Your job won't be over until you give
us evidence to put him back behind bars.

42:23.295 --> 42:24.330
So, what's the latest?

42:25.215 --> 42:26.887
There's nothing concrete.

42:27.055 --> 42:29.171
But I'll let you know
when I get something.

42:29.335 --> 42:30.529
All right.

42:30.695 --> 42:31.730
Good man.

42:57.335 --> 42:59.690
Well, if you're watching this...

42:59.855 --> 43:03.370
...I'm glad
because that means you're safe.

43:11.455 --> 43:14.413
- How does he think he's gonna do this?
- Jump out of the plane.

43:14.575 --> 43:17.965
- I know he's gonna jump. Can he land?
- Not without getting caught.

43:18.135 --> 43:20.695
How's he gonna get out of the cellblock?
Even if T-Bag...

43:20.855 --> 43:24.689
It's a big "if." Trusting T-Bag is crazy.

43:25.215 --> 43:28.093
Michael,
we really have to rethink this.

43:28.255 --> 43:31.372
I have. And there's no other way.

43:31.895 --> 43:35.126
Okay, I'm gonna drop down
into this outer area here.

43:35.295 --> 43:37.763
I'll cut the parachute off
before anyone can reach me.

43:37.935 --> 43:39.288
They're gonna be on your ass.

43:39.455 --> 43:43.494
I can hide behind this building, wait for
a window. I'll make my way over here.

43:43.655 --> 43:47.250
That's the chapel where, hopefully,
Sara will be waiting.

43:47.415 --> 43:48.689
Why the chapel?

43:48.855 --> 43:52.006
During a riot, prison employees
escaped through the admin building.

43:52.175 --> 43:54.530
They wound up here,
outside the fence.

43:54.695 --> 43:58.210
The administration building
is connected to the chapel...

43:58.375 --> 44:02.573
...which means that somewhere in that
compound, there's a subterranean exit.

44:02.735 --> 44:04.726
If we can get through it...

44:04.895 --> 44:06.089
...you can meet us there.

44:06.255 --> 44:09.850
- How's Sara gonna get to the chapel?
- She'll have to find a way.

44:10.375 --> 44:13.924
Look, we're doing this at <i>7 p.m. tonight,
just like we planned.</i>

44:14.615 --> 44:16.367
Where've you been?

44:16.535 --> 44:17.604
What did I miss?

44:17.775 --> 44:22.166
I need you to find a plane and a pilot.
I need you two to take care of T-Bag.

44:22.335 --> 44:25.645
Find out exactly who has this money
and where they're keeping it.

44:25.815 --> 44:28.568
- And then we have to get it.
- By <i>7 p.m. tonight.</i>

44:31.575 --> 44:33.054
Or Sara's gonna die in there.

44:34.655 --> 44:36.771
- Is everybody onboard?
- Yeah.

44:37.295 --> 44:38.284
Okay.

44:42.895 --> 44:45.204
Tell me you completed
your assignment.

44:46.735 --> 44:50.364
Well, I've got the cash, but there may be
some delay with final delivery.

44:50.535 --> 44:53.891
The woman we hired is having trouble
getting near Sara Tancredi.

44:54.055 --> 44:57.252
Hire somebody else. Call it open season.
Put a bounty on her head.

44:57.415 --> 45:02.694
I don't care how you do it. I want Sara
Tancredi dead by the end of the day.

45:04.055 --> 45:07.286
Open cell. One hour.

45:19.055 --> 45:21.011
Yo, we about to play cards.
Do you want in?

45:23.015 --> 45:24.494
I'm okay. Thanks.

45:24.655 --> 45:25.883
You should.

45:26.375 --> 45:28.525
With Daddy gone,
you gonna need your backup.

45:31.255 --> 45:32.654
Hell, we all do.

45:34.455 --> 45:36.685
I've got a prenatal thing.

45:37.175 --> 45:39.211
- It's cool.
- Thanks.

45:39.375 --> 45:42.447
Not too smart though for a girl
with a bounty on her head.

45:44.535 --> 45:46.048
Or ain't you heard?

45:48.335 --> 45:50.929
Tancredi, you have visitor.

45:52.975 --> 45:55.569
Say hello to your husband for me.

46:07.655 --> 46:09.373
What's wrong?

46:11.055 --> 46:12.693
Look...

46:13.655 --> 46:17.330
...I know you don't have any control
over what's happened here...

46:18.975 --> 46:21.011
...but things aren't working out.

46:22.415 --> 46:24.087
Okay.

46:27.535 --> 46:31.323
I've been trying to find a way to do...

46:31.615 --> 46:33.253
...this...

46:34.095 --> 46:37.531
...but from where we stand right now,
there's only one option.

46:37.695 --> 46:39.845
Do you need more time to think?

46:40.375 --> 46:43.048
<i>No. No, it's not about that.</i>

46:43.215 --> 46:45.206
<i>I've made up my mind...</i>

46:45.655 --> 46:48.249
<i>...and there's really nothing</i>
<i>you can do about</i> it...

46:48.775 --> 46:52.211
...except pray for us tonight.

46:52.975 --> 46:54.488
Pray for us?

46:56.215 --> 46:58.331
You can pray for us to be together.

46:59.215 --> 47:01.285
Maybe I'll do the same.

47:05.095 --> 47:08.053
How can I rob someone
if I have no clue who he is?

47:08.215 --> 47:11.924
The log book outside says
that Krantz had one visitor yesterday.

47:12.095 --> 47:13.289
A Joe Daniels.

47:13.455 --> 47:17.084
Well, using the power of deduction,
I'd say Daniels is your bagman.

47:17.255 --> 47:20.565
You know how many Daniels
live in Miami? Thousands. I need more.

47:20.735 --> 47:21.929
You better get cracking.

47:22.095 --> 47:25.292
Because if I ain't got that money
by 7:00, you ain't got your fire...

47:25.455 --> 47:28.652
...you ain't got your fire alarm.
Pretty ain't got his Mrs. Pretty.

47:28.815 --> 47:31.966
Listen, my friend,
you're in no position to make demands.

47:32.175 --> 47:33.927
Okay.

47:34.455 --> 47:36.969
I ain't talking about backing out
of the deal.

47:37.135 --> 47:39.729
I'll put my ear to the ground,
come up with some details.

47:39.895 --> 47:41.214
Good.

47:41.855 --> 47:43.049
Then go fetch.

47:50.415 --> 47:51.404
We got a pilot.

47:52.295 --> 47:55.287
It's a guy I busted 20 years ago,
running drugs across the gulf.

47:55.655 --> 47:57.566
Went legit,
runs a charter business now.

47:57.735 --> 48:00.772
- You must've jumped out of planes, huh?
- Yeah, several.

48:00.935 --> 48:05.008
Some for sport, some necessity.
It's a big difference, Michael.

48:05.175 --> 48:08.008
It's not easy hitting the X,
especially at night.

48:08.175 --> 48:10.735
Don't worry. I can go alone.

48:11.655 --> 48:14.488
- What do you got?
- It's a test.

48:14.655 --> 48:16.771
See, the prison was built
in the mid '80s.

48:16.935 --> 48:21.690
That exit in the administration building is
protected by an electronic coded lock...

48:21.855 --> 48:23.527
...modified by a security card.

48:24.055 --> 48:26.011
Those locks
don't have power protection...

48:26.175 --> 48:27.972
...which means
you can override them.

48:28.135 --> 48:30.603
You can't go to the building's generator,
blow it out.

48:30.775 --> 48:36.008
No. Twelve-hundred-volt power surge
will just set off the other alarms.

48:36.175 --> 48:38.166
Not to mention maybe kill you.

48:41.535 --> 48:43.491
That's why we have
to find another way.

48:44.695 --> 48:46.128
Yeah.

49:00.695 --> 49:01.684
Yeah.

49:01.855 --> 49:04.244
- Talk to me, Mahone. What do you got?
- Nothing yet.

49:04.415 --> 49:08.533
I don't need updates on the hour,
I need evidence, intent. It's not crap.

49:08.695 --> 49:10.845
- <i>Call me when he's committing a crime.</i>
- Yeah.

49:11.015 --> 49:13.654
I'm not gonna let him walk away
from me like he did you.

49:13.815 --> 49:16.648
<i>He's going down</i>
<i>if I gotta shoot him in the back.</i>

49:39.015 --> 49:40.528
Sorry.

49:49.255 --> 49:50.290
Well, I don't know.

49:57.095 --> 49:59.165
All right, ladies.

50:11.895 --> 50:13.886
Time for me to get paid now, fish.

50:36.895 --> 50:38.089
Are we friends now?

50:38.255 --> 50:39.688
Get out of the way.

50:39.855 --> 50:42.210
- What happened here?
- I didn't see anything, sir.

50:42.375 --> 50:44.286
- Move.
- Me neither.

50:54.455 --> 50:55.968
Bad news.

50:57.055 --> 50:59.569
Agatha Warren is dead.

51:06.575 --> 51:09.328
- Who did that?
- No one's talking.

51:09.495 --> 51:11.451
But I hear it's those fish.

51:11.735 --> 51:14.772
Tancredi and Morgan.

51:15.175 --> 51:16.403
No!

51:17.735 --> 51:20.124
No!

51:20.615 --> 51:21.604
Here he is.

51:21.775 --> 51:25.848
If you don't like this guy,
we can still find someone else.

51:26.015 --> 51:27.812
Good to see you, Snee.

51:28.175 --> 51:30.086
What you getting into here, Mahone?

51:30.255 --> 51:34.043
- Jumping 1500 feet ain't gonna be easy.
- You going back on your word already?

51:34.215 --> 51:36.092
Let's not forget
who's doing who a favor.

51:36.255 --> 51:37.370
A favor? A favor.

51:37.535 --> 51:40.254
Did I bust your old lady for trafficking?
No, I did not.

51:42.055 --> 51:44.808
Anyone asks,
I was flying a tourist through the Keys.

51:44.975 --> 51:46.567
And it's not my fault they jumped.

51:47.095 --> 51:48.926
Sounds good to me.

51:55.895 --> 51:58.853
If you don't like this guy, take a day.
Come up with a new plan.

51:59.015 --> 52:01.210
No. There's no time, Alex.

52:01.815 --> 52:03.567
It's not just Sara's life at risk.

52:03.735 --> 52:05.532
I understand that.

52:05.695 --> 52:08.892
I know you do. That's why I also know
I can ask for your help.

52:10.895 --> 52:13.728
- Yeah. What do you need?
- If I don't make it...

52:13.895 --> 52:16.887
...make sure Sara and my brother
get out of the country alive.

52:17.055 --> 52:19.694
I need to know they're gonna be okay.

52:20.095 --> 52:23.974
And I'm gonna trust that you'll do
everything you can to make that happen.

52:28.495 --> 52:30.133
Take this.

52:36.415 --> 52:38.690
I trust you, Alex.

52:40.015 --> 52:41.733
Remember that.

53:12.015 --> 53:13.368
Special delivery.

53:13.655 --> 53:14.690
What is it?

53:14.855 --> 53:16.174
I don't exactly know.

53:16.335 --> 53:19.088
It came via messenger
from the lady's side.

53:19.255 --> 53:23.328
"My man on the outside needs to know
who to call for the birthday present."

53:23.495 --> 53:24.530
Who's birthday is it?

53:33.215 --> 53:35.126
See to it
it gets back to the same place.

53:35.295 --> 53:37.013
Will do.

53:40.575 --> 53:42.531
So this is Joe Daniels' number, right?

53:42.695 --> 53:46.165
That's it. Is that enough information
or you need a social security number?

53:46.335 --> 53:47.654
- That'll do.
- <i>Remember...</i>

53:47.895 --> 53:50.648
...I want that money wired
to the account number specified.

53:50.815 --> 53:52.168
No wire, no fire.

53:52.335 --> 53:55.566
Do me wrong, I'll have no qualms at all
about singing loud and clear.

53:55.735 --> 53:56.724
You know what, just be ready.

54:01.535 --> 54:02.854
That was Sofia.

54:03.015 --> 54:05.131
She'll meet you
in the San Andres Harbor...

54:05.295 --> 54:07.604
...then you guys can fly to Costa Rica.
- Cool.

54:07.775 --> 54:08.969
I know where Daniels is.

54:09.135 --> 54:13.413
After we rob him, I'll take the money
to Quik Green and wire it to the bank.

54:13.815 --> 54:16.204
- Meet us at the airstrip.
- We'll give it shot, yeah.

54:16.375 --> 54:18.650
Okay. This is it.

54:19.215 --> 54:20.489
We're ready.

54:23.495 --> 54:25.292
Thanks, buddy.

54:26.695 --> 54:27.810
For everything.

54:28.775 --> 54:29.764
Good luck, <i>papi.</i>

54:29.935 --> 54:31.209
See you on the other side.

54:34.415 --> 54:39.364
Nobody's talking, huh? A girl's dead
and no one said anything, huh?

54:39.615 --> 54:40.968
You're next, Rosario.

54:41.135 --> 54:43.091
Get out of my way.

54:43.335 --> 54:44.324
The bed, it's perfect.

54:47.055 --> 54:48.966
I made it in the wood shop.

54:49.135 --> 54:53.572
I wanna give my daughter, Emily,
a birthday gift on her actual birthday.

54:53.735 --> 54:55.965
That's why I need to get out of here.

54:56.215 --> 54:58.934
- How very sentimental.
- Oh, I'm not.

54:59.095 --> 55:01.211
It's just for her.

55:02.295 --> 55:05.207
If you're smart, you'll start talking.

55:07.415 --> 55:08.768
We need to get to the chapel.

55:11.775 --> 55:13.925
- We?
- There's no way out of here right now.

55:14.095 --> 55:15.414
I'm gonna need you.

55:31.295 --> 55:32.853
- Yeah.
- Mr. Daniels.

55:33.015 --> 55:35.483
American Paint Company here
for the job.

55:35.655 --> 55:38.692
Well, this is Mr. Daniels,
but I didn't order any painters.

55:41.735 --> 55:43.453
<i>It's Wednesday. I believe you did.</i>

55:43.615 --> 55:46.288
Okay, hold it right there.
I'm calling the police.

56:01.695 --> 56:02.764
Get out.

56:08.455 --> 56:10.173
This is it.

56:11.255 --> 56:14.292
I'll be right back.
I gotta get that parachute.

56:29.055 --> 56:30.568
Michael.

56:31.935 --> 56:33.414
Come here.

56:38.335 --> 56:40.451
There's a better way.

56:41.455 --> 56:42.524
<i>Mess.</i>

56:42.775 --> 56:44.003
Mess. Half hour.

56:44.175 --> 56:47.531
Okay, let's go, girls. Get out.

56:48.055 --> 56:51.252
A little faster. We don't have all day.

56:52.175 --> 56:53.654
Let's go.

56:59.095 --> 57:01.211
- Got any ideas?
- Yeah.

57:01.375 --> 57:04.253
Keep your head down and follow me.
I'll think of something.

57:05.655 --> 57:08.408
Oh-nine, in the line.

57:08.655 --> 57:11.613
You better think of something fast
because we have company.

57:29.615 --> 57:33.927
I hope you're ready for a fight, princess.
This one's to the death.

57:37.735 --> 57:39.691
Do you think you can overpower her?

57:44.175 --> 57:45.528
Yeah.

57:45.695 --> 57:48.255
I don't think it's her
you have to worry about.

57:49.935 --> 57:50.924
Just be ready.

58:00.215 --> 58:01.409
- Hello?
- It's me.

58:01.735 --> 58:05.091
I got the message
about the birthday present.

58:05.655 --> 58:06.770
Was the gift earned?

58:06.935 --> 58:09.688
- What the hell are you talking about?
- The birthday present.

58:09.855 --> 58:12.494
Birthday present?
Two guys showed up at my house.

58:12.655 --> 58:15.533
They took the money
and they beat the crap out of...

58:25.615 --> 58:27.253
Howdy, general.

58:27.415 --> 58:30.964
Oh, I just thought I'd let you know,
I came into some green.

58:32.775 --> 58:38.133
My personal preference is two
Zagnut bars and a copy of <i>The Times.</i>

58:38.295 --> 58:40.763
So I'll see you in the a. m?

58:40.935 --> 58:43.005
You worthless son of a whore.

58:43.175 --> 58:44.290
Go to hell!

58:44.455 --> 58:46.923
Careful I don't get there first...

58:47.095 --> 58:50.132
...lest I become king
of that prison too.

58:57.735 --> 59:00.693
All right, from take off,
the prison's gonna come up real fast.

59:00.855 --> 59:03.130
So whatever you gotta do to get ready,
do it now.

59:03.295 --> 59:04.853
You got it.

59:06.215 --> 59:09.605
We got the money. Sucre just dropped
me off on the way to wire it.

59:09.775 --> 59:12.130
Good. That means T-Bag's set.

59:12.295 --> 59:15.048
I'm gonna see how long
it's gonna take him to get going.

59:17.535 --> 59:20.333
- Sure that thing's gonna hold you up?
- Yeah, it'll be fine.

59:20.695 --> 59:22.014
What about you?

59:22.175 --> 59:24.609
It's not my first time inside prison.

59:25.215 --> 59:27.570
But hopefully, it'll be my last.

59:36.975 --> 59:40.604
Think about all the amazing stories
you'll be able to tell your kid.

59:43.695 --> 59:46.653
You're gonna be the type of father
our dad never was.

59:46.975 --> 59:49.091
Someone to look up to.

59:50.775 --> 59:52.128
Take care, Michael.

59:57.335 --> 01:00:01.089
Unless you've got details I'm hanging up.
You can forget getting your badge back.

01:00:01.255 --> 01:00:03.450
He's got a plane,
gonna parachute into the yard.

01:00:03.615 --> 01:00:04.934
- What?
- I swear to God.

01:00:05.095 --> 01:00:08.132
He's gonna be over prison airspace
at 7:00.

01:00:13.775 --> 01:00:16.528
Call in reinforcements.
I want 20 armed COs in the yard.

01:00:16.695 --> 01:00:18.492
Be ready to turn off exterior lights.

01:00:18.655 --> 01:00:21.533
Scofield won't see what's coming
until it's too late.

01:00:21.695 --> 01:00:23.845
And bring me Sara Tancredi.

01:00:30.095 --> 01:00:31.494
Wait. Wait...

01:00:31.655 --> 01:00:34.215
What happened with Agatha,
it's not what happened.

01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:36.445
I need to make this right with you,
okay?

01:00:36.615 --> 01:00:37.968
Go ahead.

01:00:38.775 --> 01:00:40.447
I was hoping I'd see you here.

01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:44.694
You know I still owe you
one big juicy favor.

01:00:44.855 --> 01:00:45.924
Later, blue eyes.

01:00:46.095 --> 01:00:49.565
I swear to God, she wanted to kill me
and I was just defending myself.

01:00:50.015 --> 01:00:52.006
- Remember that?
- Yes, I do.

01:00:52.175 --> 01:00:54.006
My mama gave me that.

01:00:55.215 --> 01:00:57.888
Told me I was gonna give it
to one of my kids one day.

01:00:58.895 --> 01:01:03.173
Now, I never did get knocked up,
but I grew a family.

01:01:03.575 --> 01:01:07.534
And I practically raised Agatha
and she wasn't no killer.

01:01:08.495 --> 01:01:10.690
Now, I can't say that much for myself.

01:01:12.575 --> 01:01:15.294
You don't even know
what I had in mind yet.

01:01:15.575 --> 01:01:18.135
Okay, listen, you're right.
Agatha isn't a killer.

01:01:18.295 --> 01:01:21.651
She was just a greedy little bitch
who bit off more than she could chew.

01:01:25.415 --> 01:01:27.133
Skittlez.

01:01:27.695 --> 01:01:28.969
Okay. We cool.

01:01:29.135 --> 01:01:30.614
We cool.

01:01:30.775 --> 01:01:32.128
We cool. We...

01:01:34.215 --> 01:01:38.003
<i>Cowler, Simms wants you</i>
<i>to bring Tancredi to her office.</i>

01:01:38.535 --> 01:01:40.127
All right, okay.

01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:07.371
Son of a bitch.

01:02:08.375 --> 01:02:10.730
They'll be coming by
through here, okay?

01:02:11.495 --> 01:02:14.293
Federal Agent Todd Wheatley.
I need to get inside right now.

01:02:14.455 --> 01:02:17.492
- Emergency Team takes priority.
- I'm leader of the Emergency Team.

01:02:17.655 --> 01:02:19.088
- Let me inside.
- I have orders.

01:02:19.255 --> 01:02:22.327
Go talk to your supervisor. Come on.

01:02:22.495 --> 01:02:24.963
Yo, Evan, let the Suburban through.

01:02:37.455 --> 01:02:39.491
That plane should be overhead
any minute.

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:41.568
Hey, fellas, kill the lights.

01:02:51.455 --> 01:02:54.811
As soon as he hits the ground,
that's when I want you to start firing.

01:02:58.935 --> 01:03:00.846
Stand by.

01:03:05.735 --> 01:03:07.134
We're standing by.

01:03:08.455 --> 01:03:10.969
Easy now. Hold your fire.

01:03:13.175 --> 01:03:14.972
Stand by.

01:03:15.135 --> 01:03:16.727
Now.

01:03:20.495 --> 01:03:22.770
- Let's go. Move in, men.
- Move in, move in.

01:03:22.935 --> 01:03:25.654
- <i>Hold your fire. Hold your fire.</i>
- Okay, stand by.

01:03:25.815 --> 01:03:27.407
Moving in.

01:03:40.615 --> 01:03:42.810
Where the hell is Scofield?

01:03:52.575 --> 01:03:55.772
- The Emergency Team takes priority.
- I'm the leader of the team.

01:03:55.935 --> 01:03:59.291
- Now, let me inside, right now.
- I have strict orders no one gets inside.

01:03:59.455 --> 01:04:02.845
I don't care what your orders are.
Go talk to your supervisor.

01:04:23.335 --> 01:04:24.927
<i>Why isn't Tancredi in front of me?</i>

01:04:25.095 --> 01:04:27.165
We just got this situation
under control.

01:04:27.335 --> 01:04:29.166
We're looking for her right now.

01:04:29.335 --> 01:04:30.324
Oh, my God.

01:04:31.375 --> 01:04:34.526
- Are you all right?
- It was Morgan.

01:04:34.695 --> 01:04:37.493
Check the kitchen.
They might be in the kitchen.

01:05:24.735 --> 01:05:26.327
I'm not gonna make it on my own.

01:05:29.455 --> 01:05:32.049
Either leave me or don't,
but make up your damn mind.

01:05:50.375 --> 01:05:52.127
You gonna be able to make it?

01:05:53.055 --> 01:05:54.044
Yeah.

01:05:54.215 --> 01:05:55.887
Okay. It's now.

01:05:56.055 --> 01:05:57.693
Oh, God.

01:06:05.735 --> 01:06:07.407
Whoa, hold up.

01:06:17.335 --> 01:06:18.688
No, I think we're good.

01:06:41.415 --> 01:06:43.212
Don't move!

01:06:51.335 --> 01:06:52.609
Skirt in the dirt, now!

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:55.653
- Please, I just...
- On the ground!

01:07:03.055 --> 01:07:04.568
You here alone?

01:07:05.815 --> 01:07:07.965
Damn it, when I ask you a question,
you answer.

01:07:08.135 --> 01:07:09.966
Is there anyone else here?

01:07:11.575 --> 01:07:13.167
Yes.

01:07:13.495 --> 01:07:14.484
Who?

01:07:17.455 --> 01:07:18.444
God.

01:07:18.615 --> 01:07:19.684
Excuse me?

01:07:20.975 --> 01:07:22.886
He's always here.

01:07:23.695 --> 01:07:26.050
I was worried about my little girl
on the outside.

01:07:26.895 --> 01:07:29.125
So I came to pray.

01:07:29.495 --> 01:07:31.406
See if someone will watch over her.

01:07:36.695 --> 01:07:38.572
Go check it out.

01:07:59.215 --> 01:08:02.969
<i>I want some asses in the cellblock. We</i>
<i>gotta get these animals locked down.</i>

01:08:03.335 --> 01:08:04.734
We better head over there.

01:08:11.455 --> 01:08:14.049
I hope that daughter of yours
is a lot smarter than you.

01:08:14.415 --> 01:08:16.292
So do I.

01:08:30.615 --> 01:08:32.014
Hey.

01:08:34.095 --> 01:08:35.971
You ready to go?

01:08:39.215 --> 01:08:42.524
Nobody gets in or out of prison.
I don't care if it's the president...

01:08:42.694 --> 01:08:46.210
...having to take a piss. Tell him
to turn the hell around. Get a team.

01:08:46.375 --> 01:08:49.207
I want that fence line
checked for points of compromise.

01:08:49.535 --> 01:08:51.127
Yes, sir.

01:08:54.814 --> 01:08:57.648
Michael said this is where
they're gonna come out.

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:02.287
You think Sucre
made the drop on time?

01:09:02.654 --> 01:09:03.804
Don't know.

01:09:13.854 --> 01:09:15.254
No, no, no.

01:09:20.495 --> 01:09:23.407
<i>Please enter your account number.</i>

01:09:24.895 --> 01:09:27.613
Three, four, eight, pound.

01:09:28.175 --> 01:09:33.693
<i>Your account balance</i>
<i>is zero dollars and zero cents.</i>

01:09:33.854 --> 01:09:35.925
<i>If you would like</i>
<i>to access another account...</i>

01:09:36.535 --> 01:09:39.607
Nine, two, four, eight, pound.

01:09:40.175 --> 01:09:44.691
<i>Your account balance</i>
<i>is zero dollars and zero...</i>

01:09:45.694 --> 01:09:48.687
What the hell do you think
you're doing, fish? We in lockdown.

01:09:48.854 --> 01:09:49.844
What for?

01:09:50.015 --> 01:09:52.734
Something's going on in bitch block,
I don't know.

01:09:53.015 --> 01:09:54.767
What's it worth to you to find out?

01:10:01.455 --> 01:10:03.013
Are we gonna get through here?

01:10:03.175 --> 01:10:07.532
The other side is kind of an escape hatch
for the administrators, in case of a riot.

01:10:07.695 --> 01:10:09.845
This is the same system they have
in Fox River.

01:10:10.015 --> 01:10:12.768
That door can only be open remotely
from the control room.

01:10:12.935 --> 01:10:14.527
That's why we had to ask for help.

01:10:15.735 --> 01:10:17.566
T-Bag.

01:10:20.015 --> 01:10:22.051
Tell them what you told me.

01:10:22.535 --> 01:10:25.288
Michael Scofield's about
to stage a prison break.

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:30.006
And I know exactly
how he's gonna do it.

01:10:31.935 --> 01:10:34.165
Exactly what did Scofield
ask you to do?

01:10:34.335 --> 01:10:39.204
Just light a fire in my cell
and the rest will just take care of itself.

01:10:39.855 --> 01:10:42.415
Fire alarm. When that goes off,
what's your protocol?

01:10:42.575 --> 01:10:44.247
State law, mandatory evac.

01:10:44.415 --> 01:10:47.168
He wasn't gonna break her out,
he was gonna get you to.

01:10:47.335 --> 01:10:49.803
- Shut up.
- Get him out of here.

01:10:50.335 --> 01:10:53.293
All right, the evacuation's only gonna
get him out of the yard.

01:10:53.455 --> 01:10:57.130
Whatever he's up to,
he needs noise and he needs chaos.

01:10:57.295 --> 01:10:59.763
Deactivate the smoke detection system,
the fire alarm.

01:10:59.935 --> 01:11:01.732
And while you're at it, kill the horn.

01:11:01.895 --> 01:11:05.126
If anybody so much as bends a blade
of grass in this place...

01:11:05.295 --> 01:11:07.525
...I wanna be able to hear it.

01:11:13.695 --> 01:11:14.810
What are we waiting for?

01:11:14.975 --> 01:11:16.772
We made a deal.

01:11:17.015 --> 01:11:20.974
For the right price,
T-Bag would set off the fire alarms.

01:11:31.255 --> 01:11:33.485
That's what we were waiting for.

01:11:45.615 --> 01:11:47.207
- Michael, there's a...
- It's okay.

01:11:47.615 --> 01:11:51.085
There's only one thing you can count on
when you're dealing with T-Bag...

01:11:51.255 --> 01:11:52.608
...he's a rat.

01:11:56.015 --> 01:11:58.529
- Anything?
- Just female inmate loose in the yard.

01:11:58.695 --> 01:11:59.844
- Tancredi?
- No, Morgan.

01:12:00.015 --> 01:12:01.050
First name, Gretchen.

01:12:01.215 --> 01:12:03.410
- Over by the chapel.
- All right.

01:12:11.855 --> 01:12:13.208
All right.

01:12:16.215 --> 01:12:17.807
Great. Now, let's go.

01:12:24.695 --> 01:12:27.289
Okay. Down there.

01:12:42.215 --> 01:12:44.171
Okay.

01:12:44.775 --> 01:12:47.767
Beyond this door should be
a hundred yards of tunnel.

01:12:47.935 --> 01:12:50.449
On the other end of that is Linc
and after that...

01:12:50.615 --> 01:12:54.494
...there's a boat bound
for white sand and blue water.

01:12:55.495 --> 01:12:57.372
A power surge to the system...

01:12:57.535 --> 01:13:00.288
...will override the reader
for just a few seconds...

01:13:00.455 --> 01:13:03.208
...just long enough for you
to open the hatch, so get ready.

01:13:05.575 --> 01:13:09.773
Three, two, one.

01:13:12.655 --> 01:13:14.373
One more time.

01:13:15.095 --> 01:13:17.529
Three, two, one.

01:13:24.695 --> 01:13:26.572
I was afraid this might happen.

01:13:26.735 --> 01:13:27.850
It's okay.

01:13:28.015 --> 01:13:31.325
It's all right. We're gonna keep moving.
We're gonna find another way.

01:13:32.735 --> 01:13:35.169
I know what I have to do.

01:13:50.695 --> 01:13:52.845
I need units to the chapel, now.

01:13:53.015 --> 01:13:55.165
<i>Unit 53, 10-4.</i>

01:14:01.695 --> 01:14:03.253
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

01:14:03.415 --> 01:14:05.292
They should've been here by now.

01:14:09.095 --> 01:14:11.370
The battery wasn't generating
enough power.

01:14:11.535 --> 01:14:14.527
We have to blow the system
for the whole building.

01:14:18.215 --> 01:14:19.887
Okay. What do you wanna try?

01:14:22.055 --> 01:14:23.124
This is the main fuse.

01:14:23.295 --> 01:14:27.208
If I yank that,
everything will go dark for a second.

01:14:27.375 --> 01:14:29.411
If I reconnect these two cables...

01:14:31.575 --> 01:14:35.124
If I reconnect these two cables,
there'll be a lot of noise.

01:14:35.295 --> 01:14:36.887
And every bulb is gonna blow.

01:14:37.055 --> 01:14:39.410
As soon as that happens,
open that hatch...

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:41.208
...I want you to start running.

01:14:41.815 --> 01:14:44.204
Okay. What about you?

01:14:49.735 --> 01:14:50.724
Michael.

01:14:52.295 --> 01:14:54.126
Sara...

01:14:55.215 --> 01:14:57.683
...someone has to stay here.

01:14:57.855 --> 01:14:59.607
And someone has to open the hatch.

01:15:00.335 --> 01:15:01.973
And that someone's gonna be you.

01:15:02.135 --> 01:15:04.888
Okay. So I'll leave it open for you.

01:15:05.055 --> 01:15:06.408
You don't understand.

01:15:07.135 --> 01:15:09.091
This is the only way.

01:15:14.495 --> 01:15:16.884
I'm not leaving
unless you're coming with me.

01:15:19.415 --> 01:15:21.167
I am coming with you.

01:15:28.095 --> 01:15:29.494
I love you.

01:15:30.615 --> 01:15:33.129
God, I love you too.

01:15:37.375 --> 01:15:38.933
Go.

01:15:39.455 --> 01:15:40.490
Go, Sara.

01:15:41.135 --> 01:15:42.693
Go.

01:16:45.175 --> 01:16:46.654
Down the stairs.

01:17:04.695 --> 01:17:06.492
Where's Michael?

01:17:08.535 --> 01:17:10.127
Sara, where's...?

01:17:10.295 --> 01:17:11.774
Where's Michael?

01:17:11.935 --> 01:17:13.050
Where is he?

01:17:27.335 --> 01:17:29.371
He's not coming back.

01:17:34.935 --> 01:17:36.334
He's not coming back.

01:17:36.495 --> 01:17:38.690
What do you mean
he's not coming back?

01:17:38.855 --> 01:17:40.925
What do you mean by that?

01:17:43.295 --> 01:17:45.286
He's not coming back.

01:17:50.815 --> 01:17:52.373
He'll be here.

01:17:55.055 --> 01:17:56.852
He's gone, Linc.

01:18:04.255 --> 01:18:06.211
Linc, we gotta go.

01:18:08.455 --> 01:18:10.207
We gotta go.

01:18:28.575 --> 01:18:30.247
We gotta go.

01:19:02.215 --> 01:19:04.934
Hey, it's gonna be open in a minute.

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:08.770
Why am I being punished?

01:19:08.935 --> 01:19:10.732
I'm the guy who blew the whistle!

01:19:10.895 --> 01:19:13.204
You aided and abetted an escape,
Mr. Bagwell.

01:19:13.375 --> 01:19:16.333
As far as the authorities are concerned,
you're an accomplice.

01:19:17.735 --> 01:19:20.203
Scofield!

01:19:20.895 --> 01:19:23.170
Scofield!

01:19:25.815 --> 01:19:30.047
Scofield!

01:19:51.535 --> 01:19:54.527
Michael asked me to give you this
if he didn't make it out.

01:19:54.695 --> 01:19:57.926
He said it would help you understand
why he did what he did.

01:20:02.015 --> 01:20:04.051
It's his blood work.

01:20:27.015 --> 01:20:29.290
This is the general's money.

01:20:29.575 --> 01:20:33.693
I was supposed to wire it down
to Costa Rica for you to pick up...

01:20:34.535 --> 01:20:36.890
...but I ran into some trouble.

01:20:37.935 --> 01:20:39.732
I'm sorry.

01:20:41.695 --> 01:20:43.925
You take care of that baby, okay?

01:20:44.655 --> 01:20:46.771
You take care of yours.

01:21:13.375 --> 01:21:14.774
It's for you.

01:21:16.535 --> 01:21:18.765
He never said anything to me.

01:21:19.815 --> 01:21:21.931
Why didn't he just tell me?

01:21:22.855 --> 01:21:24.573
Because he knew
you'd try to stop him.

01:21:24.895 --> 01:21:27.125
He knew you'd do anything
to protect your family.

01:21:27.455 --> 01:21:29.252
But I didn't.

01:21:34.615 --> 01:21:36.094
Well...

01:21:37.415 --> 01:21:39.406
...you will soon.

01:21:42.295 --> 01:21:44.047
Take it easy.

01:21:52.655 --> 01:21:54.213
Sara.

01:21:55.935 --> 01:21:57.687
Thank you.

01:21:59.655 --> 01:22:01.168
Yeah.

01:22:39.855 --> 01:22:42.369
<i>Well, if you're watching this,</i>
<i>I'm glad...</i>

01:22:42.535 --> 01:22:44.491
<i>...because it means you're safe.</i>

01:22:47.535 --> 01:22:49.890
<i>And that's all I ever wanted.</i>

01:22:51.295 --> 01:22:54.332
<i>I wish I could be there with you.</i>

01:22:54.895 --> 01:22:57.489
<i>But as you probably know now...</i>

01:22:58.055 --> 01:23:00.615
<i>...I wouldn't have had much time</i>
<i>anyway...</i>

01:23:01.895 --> 01:23:04.011
<i>...so I made my choice...</i>

01:23:05.575 --> 01:23:07.054
<i>...and I don 't regret it.</i>

01:23:09.655 --> 01:23:12.169
<i>Anyway, not too long from now...</i>

01:23:12.335 --> 01:23:15.327
<i>...there's gonna be another little Scofield</i>
<i>running around.</i>

01:23:15.495 --> 01:23:20.125
<i>And, Linc, I want you to promise me,</i>
<i>no matter what...</i>

01:23:20.295 --> 01:23:23.890
<i>...they're gonna grow up</i>
<i>knowing their uncle is never far away.</i>

01:23:25.215 --> 01:23:26.773
<i>And, Sara...</i>

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:29.972
<i>...I want you to promise me</i>
<i>that you're gonna keep an eye on Linc.</i>

01:23:30.495 --> 01:23:33.805
<i>As you may have noticed,</i>
<i>he has a tendency to get in trouble.</i>

01:23:39.575 --> 01:23:42.487
<i>You know,</i>
<i>we spend so much of our lives...</i>

01:23:42.655 --> 01:23:45.089
<i>...not saying</i>
<i>the things we wanna say...</i>

01:23:45.255 --> 01:23:47.610
<i>...the things we should say.</i>

01:23:48.335 --> 01:23:52.965
<i>We speak in code</i>
<i>and we send little messages, origami.</i>

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:56.453
<i>So now, plainly, simply...</i>

01:23:58.495 --> 01:24:01.134
<i>...I wanna say that I love you both.</i>

01:24:03.575 --> 01:24:05.452
<i>Very much.</i>

01:24:07.175 --> 01:24:09.735
<i>And I want you to promise</i> me...

01:24:10.015 --> 01:24:12.768
<i>...that you're gonna tell my child...</i>

01:24:14.415 --> 01:24:19.205
<i>That you're gonna tell my child</i>
<i>how much they're loved every day.</i>

01:24:19.375 --> 01:24:21.730
