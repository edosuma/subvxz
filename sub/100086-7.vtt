07:52.812 --> 07:55.123
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS)

07:55.148 --> 07:56.834
Oh, you're not here to see Erica.

07:56.859 --> 07:59.334
Get comfy. This is
an old-fashioned stakeout.

07:59.359 --> 08:01.678
Here. I made coffee and hot dogs.

08:01.703 --> 08:03.633
Oh, no, thank you.

08:03.658 --> 08:05.693
Hot dogs kind of jack up my stomach,

08:05.718 --> 08:06.863
and also, what's happening right now?

08:06.887 --> 08:08.481
See those idiots over there?

08:08.506 --> 08:09.655
GEOFF: You mean my mom and her friends?

08:09.679 --> 08:11.513
We're gonna make sure
those baked potatoes

08:11.538 --> 08:13.732
don't compromise the safety
of the entire neighborhood.

08:13.757 --> 08:16.993
So, we're like the
Neighborhood Watch Watch?

08:17.018 --> 08:18.146
For all we know,

08:18.171 --> 08:20.084
one of those shaved bears
could be the culprit.

08:20.109 --> 08:21.752
You mean, like, my mom who I love?

08:21.777 --> 08:23.177
Quiet. Somebody's coming.

08:23.202 --> 08:24.714
Oh, no. Is it the axe-wielding maniac?

08:24.738 --> 08:25.912
I'll protect you!

08:26.395 --> 08:28.545
Hey, cheggit. My boyfriend and mom

08:28.570 --> 08:30.488
are mashed together in
the front seat of a car.

08:30.513 --> 08:31.513
We're on duty,

08:31.538 --> 08:33.553
so beat it before you blow our cover!

08:33.578 --> 08:36.357
Yeah, I hate to disturb
whatever this is,

08:36.381 --> 08:37.682
but, um, what are you doing?

08:37.707 --> 08:39.905
She tricked me into spying on
the neighborhood watch with her.

08:39.929 --> 08:41.965
Oh. Well, here's an idea for a big boy.

08:41.990 --> 08:43.131
Come with me.

08:43.414 --> 08:45.166
Don't you dare open that door,

08:45.191 --> 08:46.568
or so help me, you're off the squad.

08:46.592 --> 08:48.152
Oh, no. Then there wouldn't be a squad.

08:48.177 --> 08:50.207
Erica, get in or get out.

08:50.232 --> 08:51.865
Oh, tough one.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.590
Dammit, they made us!

08:53.615 --> 08:54.699
Beverly?

08:54.724 --> 08:57.099
We rang your bell to come join us.

08:57.279 --> 08:58.437
Oh.

08:58.462 --> 09:01.798
Well, I was busy
enjoying a cool afternoon

09:01.823 --> 09:03.190
with my daughter's boyfriend.

09:03.215 --> 09:04.935
- Are you okay, Geoffrey?
- No.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.194
Strange, you girls
are going East to West.

09:07.219 --> 09:08.623
The light's not as good.

09:08.648 --> 09:09.671
You know, if I were captain...

09:09.695 --> 09:12.194
Well, you can stop right there.
Because you're not.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.256
Well, I'm going this way. Who's with me?

09:14.866 --> 09:17.076
Bevy, Jane's the captain.

09:18.147 --> 09:19.420
Well, you've left me no choice.

09:19.445 --> 09:22.209
I am starting my own Neighborhood Watch.

09:22.835 --> 09:24.631
Come on, Geoff!

09:24.997 --> 09:27.975
Sorry, Mama. I guess I got to
go with my girlfriend's mom.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.748
See ya at dinner, I hope.

09:29.773 --> 09:31.808
<i>ADULT ADAM: As our mom
was starting her own watch,</i>

09:31.833 --> 09:35.116
<i>our dad and Pops were waiting
in line for the big event.</i>

09:35.141 --> 09:36.808
This is great, Mur.

09:36.833 --> 09:39.101
Seeing the sweaty muscle men live

09:39.126 --> 09:41.991
is way better than watching it on TV.

09:42.016 --> 09:43.023
<i>ADULT ADAM: This was it.</i>

09:50.859 --> 09:52.258
This makes no sense.

09:52.283 --> 09:53.583
What are we gonna do?

09:53.608 --> 09:55.100
The only thing we can do,

09:55.125 --> 09:57.569
that's go home and never try again.

09:57.594 --> 10:00.773
No, Murray, you can't stop now!

10:01.267 --> 10:02.834
What about a scalper?

10:02.869 --> 10:05.719
(GROANS) Stop coming up with solutions!

10:06.101 --> 10:08.711
Oh! Looks like we got a couple
wrestling fans right here.

10:08.736 --> 10:11.281
How would you like some
primo seats to WrestleMania

10:11.306 --> 10:13.254
and/or some heavily discounted,

10:13.279 --> 10:14.546
unlicensed merchandise?

10:14.571 --> 10:16.695
Who's "Ander the Gaint"?

10:16.720 --> 10:18.869
The misspelling makes
it a collector's item.

10:18.894 --> 10:20.195
Just three of your best seats.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.554
You are in my luck, my friend.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.080
I got three in the third row.

10:23.105 --> 10:26.147
And to see those jacked,
glistening bodies that close,

10:26.172 --> 10:28.226
it's only gonna set you back 400 bucks.

10:28.251 --> 10:30.211
(GRUNTS) Just give me the tickets.

10:31.320 --> 10:33.680
Cage-side seats? This is amazing!

10:33.705 --> 10:35.789
We're gonna have the
greatest day of our lives!

10:35.814 --> 10:37.848
- Hell, yeah, we are!
- Wait. You're going, too?

10:37.873 --> 10:39.767
Yeah. I wouldn't let you go to
Wrestletown without me.

10:39.791 --> 10:40.848
WrestleMania.

10:40.873 --> 10:43.217
- I can't wait to see Hunk Hoggins.
- Hulk Hogan.

10:43.242 --> 10:44.576
And Andy Macho Dan Rather.

10:44.601 --> 10:45.868
Randy "Macho Man" Savage.

10:45.893 --> 10:47.234
All the greats!

10:47.828 --> 10:50.892
Okay, I don't know what Dad's up to,

10:50.917 --> 10:52.751
but he's definitely gonna embarrass us

10:52.776 --> 10:55.396
in front of those taste-makers
and men-about-town

10:55.421 --> 10:57.430
who attend professional
wrestling events.

10:57.455 --> 10:58.467
What do we do?

10:58.492 --> 11:00.368
He did buy us amazing seats,

11:00.393 --> 11:01.893
so there's only one thing to do.

11:01.919 --> 11:03.419
<i>ADULT ADAM: Support our father.</i>

11:03.444 --> 11:05.609
- Ditch him.
- <i>ADULT ADAM: Or that.</i>

11:05.784 --> 11:07.875
<i>It had been one day since
our mom decided</i>

11:07.900 --> 11:10.367
<i>she was going to compete
with Jane Bales' neighborhood watch</i>

11:10.392 --> 11:11.586
<i>and form her own.</i>

11:11.611 --> 11:13.609
Welcome to the first meeting
of the newer,

11:13.634 --> 11:15.280
much better neighborhood watch.

11:15.305 --> 11:16.936
I'm only here to do my laundry.

11:16.961 --> 11:18.203
Roll. Don't fold.

11:18.228 --> 11:19.373
Now, I've gone over this map,

11:19.397 --> 11:20.697
and I have determined

11:20.722 --> 11:22.990
that all of the car break-ins
in this neighborhood

11:23.022 --> 11:25.139
have happened on this block.

11:25.164 --> 11:26.431
Oh, no! A pattern!

11:26.456 --> 11:28.691
- It's two pushpins, Geoff.
- You see it, too!

11:28.716 --> 11:30.211
Which is why I acquired

11:30.236 --> 11:33.086
this state-of-the-art
surveillance technology.

11:33.111 --> 11:34.489
That's how the CIA does it.

Next, our cutting-edge

11:36.040 --> 11:37.891
cordless communication devices.

Adam's G.I. Joe walkie-talkies?

11:39.920 --> 11:41.008
Mine's shaped like a cobra!

11:41.033 --> 11:43.231
And finally, official jackets.

11:43.256 --> 11:45.023
- _
- GEOFF: So many unnecessary words!

11:45.048 --> 11:47.453
And yet, not enough to
explain how stupid this is.

11:47.478 --> 11:48.478
Oh, it says "Geoff."

11:48.503 --> 11:49.863
They're never gonna see us coming.

11:50.637 --> 11:52.351
Hey, look, Beverly's coming.

11:52.376 --> 11:54.219
Good afternoon, Jane Bales

11:54.244 --> 11:56.391
and her crew of puffy-faced misfits.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.616
Beverly, give it up.

11:57.641 --> 12:00.142
The neighborhood does
not need two watches.

12:00.167 --> 12:02.633
I agree. And I accept your resignation

12:02.658 --> 12:04.547
and embarrassing tearful apology.

12:04.572 --> 12:06.367
- Are you okay, Geoffrey?
- I don't know.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.156
- Excuse me a sec.

12:08.181 --> 12:11.297
Erica, go for Chief
of Enforcement Bev. Over?

12:11.322 --> 12:13.297
Mom, I told you I don't
want any part of this.

12:13.322 --> 12:15.204

- What's that? A disturbance. Over?

12:15.228 --> 12:16.466

- Copy that. Over!
- (STATIC HISSES)

12:19.793 --> 12:21.851
You keep saying "over,"
but then it's not over.

12:21.876 --> 12:23.538
- (STATIC HISSES)
- Chief of Enforcement signing off.

12:23.562 --> 12:25.734
- (STATIC HISSES)
- Well, we must go.

12:25.759 --> 12:28.273
And while you're standing around
letting your bodies go to rot,

12:28.298 --> 12:30.726
we'll be keeping mayhem off the streets.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.719
- Lock and load, Schwartz!
- Load what?

12:32.744 --> 12:35.226
- Just follow me.
- Okay, then.

12:36.207 --> 12:37.992
- Bye, Mom.
- Take a bag of nuts.

12:38.017 --> 12:39.828
Don't talk to her.

12:40.470 --> 12:42.454
<i>ADULT ADAM: While our mom
headed out to find crime,</i>

12:42.478 --> 12:43.979
<i>my brother and I were planning</i>

12:44.004 --> 12:45.736
<i>to lose our dad at WrestleMania.</i>

12:45.761 --> 12:47.929
Okay, let's go over Operation Ditch Dad

12:47.954 --> 12:49.225
- one more time.
- Okay!

12:49.250 --> 12:50.256
When we arrive,

12:50.281 --> 12:51.948
we immediately ask Dad

12:51.973 --> 12:54.437
to buy us a ton of WrestleMania merch.

12:54.462 --> 12:56.429
And then we head over
to this food station

12:56.454 --> 12:59.474
and have Dad buy us each
a giant 64-ounce Slushie.

12:59.499 --> 13:01.256
Then his bladder will fill,

13:01.281 --> 13:03.672
and he'll have to rush to the restroom.

13:03.697 --> 13:06.023
At that point, we go
to the other side of the cage

13:06.048 --> 13:07.815
and exchange our tickets

13:07.840 --> 13:09.674
with some jacked wrestling bros.

13:09.699 --> 13:11.703
Then Dad will return to his seat,

13:11.728 --> 13:15.430
see the jacked bros,
be enraged and confused,

13:15.455 --> 13:17.492
and decide to take a nap in his car.

13:17.532 --> 13:18.967
It's utterly foolproof.

13:18.992 --> 13:21.812
You know, unless our dad actually
wants to spend time with us.

13:21.837 --> 13:24.639
We're talking about our
dad actually being a dad?

13:24.664 --> 13:26.732
And maybe we should
actually enjoy the day

13:26.757 --> 13:28.870
as if we were regular kids who know love

13:28.895 --> 13:30.460
from a male figure in their lives.

13:30.485 --> 13:33.726
And he won't embarrass us
and it'll actually be fun?

Hey, hey, hey! Let's do this!

13:36.068 --> 13:37.695

- What the hell, man?

13:37.720 --> 13:40.115
I've been watching wrestling.
I love "Ding Dong" Randy.

13:40.140 --> 13:42.109
It's "King Kong" Bundy.

Erica's old bathing suit?

We stick with the plan.

13:51.821 --> 13:53.521

with boom boxes blaring.

BevWatch sprays them with garden hose,

14:18.919 --> 14:21.257
assures them, "There's more
where that came from."

14:21.282 --> 14:22.780

15:27.684 --> 15:29.252
That was a fun interaction.

15:29.277 --> 15:32.456
Dad's being super weird and
affectionate, and I kinda love it.

15:32.481 --> 15:34.299
He's being the father
we've always wanted.

15:34.324 --> 15:35.797
It's really off-putting.

15:35.822 --> 15:37.432
Yo, I think you're in our seats.

15:37.457 --> 15:39.766
Nah, nah, nah, pal. We're all good.

15:39.791 --> 15:40.827
These are fake.

15:40.852 --> 15:42.809
No, they're not. (SCOFFS)

15:42.834 --> 15:44.001
Oh, balls!

15:44.026 --> 15:46.699
WhistleMania, a whistling competition.

15:46.724 --> 15:48.159
What? Whistling?

15:48.184 --> 15:50.912
That's for tea kettles and
letting a lady know she's pretty.

15:50.937 --> 15:52.259
- Come on. Let's go.
- No!

15:52.284 --> 15:53.806
No way! We're not leaving.

15:53.831 --> 15:55.899
- I'm getting security.
- What is happening?!

15:55.924 --> 15:57.976
Are we getting kicked out
of WrestleMania IV?

15:58.001 --> 15:59.579
There's the Hulkster! Go, Hulk!

15:59.604 --> 16:00.689
Whoo!

16:00.714 --> 16:02.514
- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
- Oh! It's starting!

16:02.539 --> 16:03.714
And we're gonna miss it all!

16:03.739 --> 16:06.760
And to think, we actually felt
guilty about ditching you!

16:06.785 --> 16:09.456
Wait, you were gonna ditch me
even though I bought you tickets?

16:09.481 --> 16:11.482
You didn't buy us tickets.
These are fakes.

16:11.507 --> 16:13.675
If you really wanted
to spend time with us,

16:13.700 --> 16:14.932
you'd know we hate whistling.

16:14.957 --> 16:16.229
Here comes Andre the Giant!

16:16.254 --> 16:18.006
Oh, man, Hulk's gonna crush you, bro!

16:18.031 --> 16:19.549
You wanna know why I did it?

16:19.574 --> 16:21.581
Because I had a health thing, okay?

16:22.152 --> 16:24.167
My doctor scared the hell out of me.

16:24.192 --> 16:25.759
Wait. What? Dad, are you okay?

16:25.784 --> 16:27.120
I'm fine.

16:27.145 --> 16:29.690
But it made me realize I'm
not gonna be around forever,

16:29.715 --> 16:32.404
and I wanted to make some
memories with you guys,

16:32.429 --> 16:33.909
at least one memory.

16:36.258 --> 16:38.620
Sir, I'm gonna have to
ask you to come with me.

16:38.864 --> 16:41.135
Well, since you were gonna ditch me,

16:41.160 --> 16:43.214
I can assume you'll find a ride home.

16:43.239 --> 16:45.333
Ohh! That had to hurt!

16:45.358 --> 16:46.759

16:52.880 --> 16:54.997
Thank you all for coming
and thank you once again

16:55.022 --> 16:57.226
to my brother-in-arms,
Officer Puchinski.

16:57.251 --> 16:58.716
Well, I assume we're here so

16:58.741 --> 17:00.980
you can fess up to
cracking my car window.

17:01.005 --> 17:03.082
Oh, I did crack something, Jane.

17:03.107 --> 17:05.166
- I cracked the case.
- (WOMEN GASP)

17:05.192 --> 17:09.160
Yeah. That's right. The person
who broke the windows was...

17:09.185 --> 17:10.605
- ... this guy.
- (ALL GASP)

17:10.630 --> 17:11.675
GEOFF: A pinecone?

17:11.701 --> 17:13.747
And it would've gotten away
with it if it weren't for you.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.482
Please. I mean,
this is really who you want

17:15.507 --> 17:16.685
leading your neighborhood watch?

17:16.710 --> 17:18.192
Both Ginzy and Geoff

17:18.217 --> 17:20.852
parked underneath the
giant pine tree out front.

17:20.877 --> 17:22.721
The autumn breeze
loosened one of the cones,

17:22.746 --> 17:24.098
and... Whammo!

17:24.124 --> 17:26.200
- Broken glass.
- That does make sense.

17:26.224 --> 17:28.292
Of course! Pinecones!
They're nature's rocks!

17:28.318 --> 17:30.104
Rocks are nat... Never mind.

17:30.129 --> 17:32.041
Okay, but that doesn't
explain who wrote the note

17:32.065 --> 17:34.530
with the colorful Bev language, hmm?

17:34.555 --> 17:35.943
As you may not know,

17:35.968 --> 17:39.013
I set up Adam's video camera
to record our front yard,

17:39.038 --> 17:40.447
and... (GASPS) Oh, my!

17:40.472 --> 17:42.164

17:48.895 --> 17:50.311
Okay. Here... Here we go.

17:50.336 --> 17:51.647
There's Jane's car.

17:51.672 --> 17:53.335
And what have we here?

17:53.360 --> 17:55.321
- There's Jane.
- (ALL GASP)

17:55.346 --> 17:57.100
You vandalized your own car.

17:57.125 --> 17:59.499
Damn right she did, to frame me!

17:59.524 --> 18:01.421
Fine! It's true!

18:01.446 --> 18:02.493
(LAUGHING)

18:02.518 --> 18:04.238
She admitted it! Bev wins!

18:04.263 --> 18:06.125
I'm sorry. I just felt so...

18:06.469 --> 18:08.178
... threatened by you!

18:08.203 --> 18:10.144
You are so smart and cunning,

18:10.169 --> 18:12.421
and you were gonna steal the
neighborhood watch from me.

18:12.446 --> 18:14.039
I had to do something!

18:14.064 --> 18:16.828
You thought I was gonna steal the watch?

18:17.868 --> 18:20.718
That is the sweetest
thing I've ever heard.

18:20.743 --> 18:21.746
- Is it?
- I mean,

18:21.771 --> 18:24.172
you are the neighborhood badass.

18:24.197 --> 18:27.432
I just wanted to walk in
your shoes for a moment.

18:27.457 --> 18:30.740
You would destroy your
own property for power?

18:30.765 --> 18:31.999
(BEVERLY EXHALES SHARPLY)

18:32.024 --> 18:34.632
That is the kind of
person I need on my watch.

18:34.657 --> 18:36.335
- Is it?
- What are you saying?

18:36.360 --> 18:37.672
I'm saying,

18:37.697 --> 18:40.265
let's join forces and teach each other

18:40.290 --> 18:42.741
how to be nightmares together.

18:42.766 --> 18:44.269
I would love that.
