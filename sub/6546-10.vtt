WEBVTT

00:01.294 --> 00:02.579
Audrey: Previously on Haven...

00:02.670 --> 00:04.171
Duke, are you feeling sick?

00:04.255 --> 00:05.244
'Cause a lot of Troubled people

00:05.339 --> 00:06.715
have been infected and Nathan,

00:06.799 --> 00:08.255
he's starting to bring
them into the morgue.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.331
Dwight: Maybe that's
the point of this,

00:09.427 --> 00:10.416
to infect
Troubled people

00:10.511 --> 00:12.172
and force out their Troubles.
(light bulb explodes)

00:12.763 --> 00:14.549
- Chief Hendrickson,
Dr. Charlotte Cross with the

00:14.640 --> 00:15.629
Centers for Disease Control.

00:15.725 --> 00:17.010
- Better get this CDC lady out

00:17.185 --> 00:18.891
of Haven before she gets a whiff
of the Troubles.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.305
- She starts digging
into my data,

00:20.396 --> 00:21.385
questioning me about

00:21.480 --> 00:22.936
all of my cover stories
for the Troubles.

00:23.024 --> 00:25.015
- I hereby place Haven, Maine

00:25.109 --> 00:26.098
under quarantine.

00:26.194 --> 00:29.231
Audrey: The bears are designed
to present themselves to you

00:29.322 --> 00:31.313
so if we take you out of town,

00:31.449 --> 00:33.610
maybe the bears will stop
showing up in Haven.

00:33.701 --> 00:34.690
(lapping)

00:34.785 --> 00:36.116
- Dwight.
You selfish prick.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.323
- Is it bad?
- You have no idea.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.529
- Do you still think
your friends have your back?

00:40.625 --> 00:42.957
- No.
We're on our own.

00:51.928 --> 00:52.917
(birds chirping)

00:57.058 --> 00:58.719
electronic voice:
Slow traffic ahead.

00:59.352 --> 01:00.341
Seriously?

01:03.022 --> 01:04.011
(car rattles)

01:04.607 --> 01:05.596
Seriously.

01:06.734 --> 01:07.723
(birds chirping)

01:07.818 --> 01:09.854
man: Need a hand over here.
I got to scan it again.

01:11.197 --> 01:12.528
(belt unbuckles, door opens)

01:15.952 --> 01:16.941
(door closes)

01:17.036 --> 01:18.196
(indistinct muttering)

01:19.580 --> 01:21.741
What's with the new welcome
to Haven sign, Rebecca?

01:21.832 --> 01:24.084
- Quarantine.
Nobody in or out.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.291
- Well, it looks like I got
Eve and Hank

01:26.379 --> 01:27.494
out of town just in time.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.577
- Hey...

01:29.006 --> 01:29.995
Dwight's orders.

01:30.091 --> 01:31.581
- Oh, Dwight didn't mean me.

01:31.676 --> 01:33.086
- Oh, I forgot there's rules

01:33.177 --> 01:34.542
for you and then there's rules

01:34.637 --> 01:35.626
for everybody else.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.632
(tires squealing)

01:39.684 --> 01:41.675
(door closes)
Just stop right there.

01:42.561 --> 01:43.550
- That's enough!

01:44.397 --> 01:45.386
Let her through.

01:47.233 --> 01:48.313
- The chief said nobody goes...

01:48.401 --> 01:49.481
- You want to explain to Dwight

01:49.568 --> 01:50.694
why you barred his
best detective

01:50.778 --> 01:52.279
during a crisis,
be my guest.

01:53.739 --> 01:56.116
I hear he's been looking
for a new traffic cop.

02:00.329 --> 02:01.318
- I had that.

02:01.414 --> 02:04.406
- Yeah, but this way Rebecca
has fewer black eyes.

02:05.209 --> 02:06.198
Anyway, ignore her.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.125
Everyone's on edge with the
contagion spreading

02:08.212 --> 02:09.201
throughout town.

02:09.547 --> 02:12.129
- But it only targets Troubled
people, Rebecca has a free pass.

02:12.216 --> 02:14.252
- Well, the disease sets off
Troubles without needing

02:14.343 --> 02:15.332
any emotional prompting.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.922
Every Troubled person could
go off soon.

02:18.222 --> 02:20.338
So no one in Haven is safe.

02:20.433 --> 02:23.175
Over 15 people already have the
first stage of the contagion.

02:23.769 --> 02:26.101
Pete's over at the morgue right
now keeping an eye on 'em.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.024
Soon, all their Troubles will be
activated and any one of those

02:29.108 --> 02:30.439
could claim multiple lives.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.104
- So it's a race, stop the
contagion and find the Troubled

02:33.195 --> 02:35.811
person causing it before all
the Troubles go off.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.651
- Just another day in Haven.

02:37.742 --> 02:38.948
- Hey, what else are we
gonna do?

02:39.035 --> 02:40.696
(door opens)
- I'll follow you.

02:41.287 --> 02:43.278
- Yeah, well, just keep up,
okay?

02:45.458 --> 02:46.447
(door closes)

02:46.667 --> 02:47.656
(coughing)

02:50.129 --> 02:51.460
(keys rattling, engine starting)

02:53.215 --> 02:54.546
(water sloshing,
birds chirping)

02:55.551 --> 02:57.963
(rumbling)

03:00.723 --> 03:01.712
(birds chirping)

03:02.558 --> 03:04.219
(keys jingling, engine idling)

03:07.521 --> 03:09.728
- HoW'd you know your blood
shows the same genetic marker

03:09.815 --> 03:11.225
as every person
with the disease?

03:13.319 --> 03:14.980
- Let's get some fresh air.

03:15.071 --> 03:16.060
I'll explain everything.

03:16.155 --> 03:17.144
(seatbelt clicking, retracting)

03:18.366 --> 03:19.355
(door opening)

03:23.954 --> 03:24.943
(door closing)

03:25.122 --> 03:26.987
(seatbelt clicking, retracting)

03:31.670 --> 03:32.659
(shifter clicking)

03:32.755 --> 03:33.744
(monitor beeps)

03:37.426 --> 03:38.415
(button clicks)

03:41.764 --> 03:42.753
(gun cocking)

03:42.848 --> 03:44.008
(insects chirping)

03:44.141 --> 03:45.130
(door opening)

03:46.769 --> 03:47.758
- Don't move.

03:49.355 --> 03:50.344
- You had a gun.

03:50.439 --> 03:51.428
- Just like you.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.769
I'm not going down as easily
as Mr. Banks did.

03:54.860 --> 03:55.940
(sighing)

03:56.028 --> 03:58.360
- Easy... easy, okay?
I didn't kill anyone.

03:59.323 --> 04:00.654
This gun's for you.

04:06.539 --> 04:08.404
- So much for Haven
being a peaceful town.

04:08.499 --> 04:10.160
- Yeah.
Looks can be deceiving.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.082
- So what's the plan?

04:12.211 --> 04:15.169
You take me out here and you
bury me in a shallow grave?

04:16.757 --> 04:17.746
- Target practice.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.626
- You ever hear
of a shooting range?

04:22.721 --> 04:24.712
- Just humor me.
Okay?

04:30.229 --> 04:31.218
(sighs, bird chirping)

04:33.732 --> 04:36.895
(can clacking)

04:37.903 --> 04:39.404
- Now I know why you're single.

04:45.578 --> 04:46.784
I'm not that bad of a shot.

04:46.871 --> 04:48.156
- Just do me a favor.

04:48.247 --> 04:49.703
Only fire off one round,
okay?

04:50.124 --> 04:51.204
(soft laugh)

04:55.546 --> 04:57.002
(gunshot)

05:04.763 --> 05:06.094
(loud bang)

05:07.683 --> 05:08.672
- Dwight?

05:08.767 --> 05:11.600
(Dwight gasps)
No, I... the gun malfunctioned.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.218
- I'm fine.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.600
I was prepared for it.

05:16.442 --> 05:18.933
I knew this one was coming
and l dressed...

05:19.028 --> 05:20.359
appropriately for the occasion.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.269
- What?
(sighs)

05:27.119 --> 05:30.077
- It's time I tell you about
the Troubles.

05:32.374 --> 05:33.705
(water sloshing, bird chirping)

05:34.710 --> 05:36.496
- Yeah, all right, thanks for
the heads up, Harry.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.543
Just get home and be safe.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.292
(phone beeps)

05:46.639 --> 05:48.880
- Well, are you going to
say anything?

05:48.974 --> 05:51.135
Or you just here for the show?

05:51.227 --> 05:53.889
'Cause it's 20 to watch,
50 to touch.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.135
- Just... shut up.

05:58.484 --> 05:59.724
Dwight's about to sell us out.

06:00.945 --> 06:02.435
He's gonna tell his lady friend
at the CDC

06:02.530 --> 06:03.861
all about the Troubles.

06:05.157 --> 06:08.024
- And you're wondering whether
you should let me out or not.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.155
To help you stop the contagion
and get the scientist

06:11.247 --> 06:12.236
out of Dodge.

06:13.165 --> 06:14.154
It's a risk.

06:16.001 --> 06:19.289
But so is doing nothing
and ending up in a Petri dish.

06:24.510 --> 06:25.499
(sighs)

06:26.470 --> 06:28.301
(keys rattle)

06:44.947 --> 06:48.690
(chain rattling,
hand cuffs clicking)

07:03.215 --> 07:04.204
- Well, come on.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.341
I got a job for you to do.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.256
(somber folk music)

07:43.672 --> 07:45.333
Dwight: Still need
more convincing?

07:48.135 --> 07:49.124
(banana tearing)

07:49.219 --> 07:50.208
Watch this.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.589
(birds chirping)

07:52.097 --> 07:53.086
(gloves sliding off)

07:55.434 --> 07:56.423
(crackling)

07:58.687 --> 08:00.018
Thanks.
That'll be all.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.516
- Many companies
use a form of ethanol

08:05.611 --> 08:07.272
to artificially ripen
their crops.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.613
The average human body produces
three ccs a day, so...

08:12.826 --> 08:14.157
maybe she's secreting it.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.151
- Troubles are real.

08:16.372 --> 08:17.361
- Except they're not.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.321
Magic isn't real.

08:19.625 --> 08:22.116
Witches weren't in Salem
and the Troubles aren't here.

08:22.211 --> 08:24.042
- So how did your bullet turn
and hit me?

08:24.421 --> 08:25.410
- Maybe it didn't.

08:26.840 --> 08:27.875
Maybe you had a sniper shoot

08:27.966 --> 08:29.297
at the same time I pulled
the trigger.

08:29.385 --> 08:30.716
- Why?
For what purpose?

08:31.095 --> 08:33.427
- To cover up a death.
Mr. Banks?

08:33.972 --> 08:35.587
- Banks had a carbonation
Trouble.

08:35.683 --> 08:38.550
The sickness triggered it.
Caused his IV bag to bubble.

08:38.644 --> 08:40.680
- And one of those bubbles
got into his blood stream,

08:40.771 --> 08:41.760
causing a stroke.

08:44.650 --> 08:45.639
This isn't possible.

08:46.068 --> 08:47.057
- If you're going to help us,

08:47.152 --> 08:48.767
you're going to have
to believe.

08:51.490 --> 08:52.479
(birds chirping)

08:53.701 --> 08:54.690
(indistinct chatter)

08:54.785 --> 08:56.366
woman: Yup, it's all
the way upstairs.

08:56.453 --> 08:57.442
(scoffs)
- Finally.

08:59.081 --> 09:02.073
You're a hard man to track
down, Mr. Simon.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.198
- I'm sorry, but I don't discuss

09:03.293 --> 09:04.954
work matters outside
of meetings.

09:05.254 --> 09:06.960
Contact my staff
and book a sit down

09:07.131 --> 09:08.120
with myself
and the governor.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.921
- Oh, I'll be but a minute.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.670
We're having a problem
with a federal organization

09:12.761 --> 09:13.750
overstepping in Haven.

09:14.263 --> 09:16.879
- And I'd love to make an
exception, except it wouldn't be

09:16.974 --> 09:18.965
fair to those who went through
the proper channels.

09:19.685 --> 09:21.676
- Uh, maybe this
will convince you.

09:24.189 --> 09:27.181
We helped you, Mr. Simon.
Now you help us.

09:29.278 --> 09:30.267
man: Hey, Bobby.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.568
Audrey: We might have our guy.

09:31.655 --> 09:33.020
I talked to the manager
of the restaurant

09:33.115 --> 09:35.652
where the first contagion
victims either worked or ate.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.608
And it turns out they've
had a delivery driver

09:37.703 --> 09:38.692
out sick for days.

09:38.787 --> 09:39.776
- Victor Kirby.

09:39.872 --> 09:40.861
You sure he isn'tjust
on a bender?

09:40.956 --> 09:43.072
I've picked him up for a bunch
of drunken disorderlies.

09:43.167 --> 09:44.156
- Oh, I know, that's
what I thought.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.582
But it turns out, he's here.

09:45.669 --> 09:47.375
He turned himself in and
asked to be placed

09:47.463 --> 09:48.452
in solitary confinement.

09:48.839 --> 09:51.376
- Like you would if you're
responsible for the epidemic.

09:51.467 --> 09:52.707
- Yeah.
You know what?

09:52.801 --> 09:54.416
Maybe I should handle this.

09:54.511 --> 09:57.002
- Hey, I've been around sick
people all day, I'm alive.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.962
- Oh, what, you're gonna go
all macho on me?

09:59.057 --> 10:00.046
- Yeah.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.598
(phone ringing)
man: HPD.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.056
- Stay back.
- Kirby?

10:06.899 --> 10:08.890
It's all right,
we just want to talk.

10:10.027 --> 10:12.109
You open her?
- No, it's not safe near me.

10:12.196 --> 10:13.185
(cell door sliding)

10:13.447 --> 10:15.654
- Don't worry.
You're not gonna make him sick.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.063
- What?

10:17.242 --> 10:18.652
I was blowing chunks a couple
days ago,

10:18.744 --> 10:20.109
but I'm the victim, man.

10:20.204 --> 10:22.911
- The victim.
Victim of what?

10:23.499 --> 10:26.491
- For the last couple days,
every time I touch someone,

10:26.585 --> 10:27.665
I see them die.

10:29.922 --> 10:32.629
Not right in front of me, like
how it's gonna happen some day.

10:33.008 --> 10:34.669
- Just like Vanessa Stanley.
- Right.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.133
He can't be responsible
for the contagion.

10:37.221 --> 10:38.677
- No, only one Trouble
per person.

10:38.764 --> 10:41.756
- Aunt Vanessa?
What's she have to do with this?

10:42.017 --> 10:43.348
- No! Don't touch him.

10:43.602 --> 10:44.591
(grunting, gasping)

10:47.439 --> 10:48.428
No more.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.439
- Kirby?
Calm down, okay, it's just us.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.900
- No, make it stop.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.104
- Hey.
Get out.

10:57.616 --> 10:58.947
It's all right.
Just"

11:00.285 --> 11:01.946
- Kirby?
Put the gun down.

11:02.287 --> 11:05.370
- Why is this happening to me?
- You were sick recently, right?

11:05.457 --> 11:07.118
- Yeah.
That was days ago.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.833
- That flu didn't just make
you sick.

11:10.295 --> 11:11.546
It brought out your Trouble.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.125
- And we want to fix it,
but we need to figure out

11:14.216 --> 11:15.547
how you got sick.

11:15.801 --> 11:18.042
- I must have caught it during
one of my deliveries.

11:18.136 --> 11:21.048
- Okay, so, give us your list
of your deliveries.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.845
We might be able to stop this.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.844
- You don't get it... every time
I touch someone,

11:24.935 --> 11:26.596
I see how they end.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.141
I can't live like this.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.480
You don't understand, man.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.349
- Hey, hey, hey.

11:36.238 --> 11:37.227
- Kirby, just give him...

11:37.322 --> 11:38.698
give him the gun, all right?

11:40.242 --> 11:41.231
(exhaling)

11:45.080 --> 11:46.695
(sighing)

11:48.166 --> 11:49.155
- Good.
(gun clicks)

11:49.585 --> 11:52.577
- Hey, get back.
It's okay, it's okay.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.333
- I'm so sorry about this.

11:56.425 --> 11:57.414
(coughing)

12:02.097 --> 12:03.086
You okay?

12:03.181 --> 12:04.796
(grunts)

12:05.100 --> 12:06.431
(wincing)

12:08.270 --> 12:09.259
- I'm fine.

12:09.521 --> 12:10.852
- You... you sure?

12:13.609 --> 12:15.941
'Cause I saw the end for you.

12:17.279 --> 12:19.144
You and your twin sister go
the same time.

12:27.122 --> 12:28.111
(birds chirping)

12:30.000 --> 12:32.787
- Hey, hey?
Easy on the turns, Thelma.

12:32.878 --> 12:35.119
All right?
There's no seat belts back here.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.625
- I think you can handle
a few bumps.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.752
- Or I could ride up there
with you.

12:39.843 --> 12:42.459
I think we could use somebody
to work the radio.

12:42.554 --> 12:45.341
- You know, I just don't think
it's a good idea to have Haven's

12:45.432 --> 12:48.344
most wanted riding shot gun
where everyone can see her.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.096
- And like you're a saint.

12:50.729 --> 12:54.597
Aren't we off to kill the person
responsible for this "contagion"

12:54.691 --> 12:56.477
so we can send the CDC packing?

12:56.568 --> 12:57.557
- Think about it.

12:57.653 --> 12:59.769
If that was my plan, why would
I even bring you with me?

12:59.863 --> 13:03.230
- Oh, I don't know,
my effervescent personality?

13:03.325 --> 13:04.314
Heh...

13:04.409 --> 13:06.616
Rumor that I put out?

13:07.245 --> 13:10.783
- Maybe I need you to alter
the person with this Trouble

13:10.874 --> 13:14.458
so that they don't get people
sick and just get them to spout

13:14.544 --> 13:16.080
nougat or something.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.166
- Well, that sounds like
a great plan.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.757
Did you come up
with that yourself?

13:20.634 --> 13:22.545
There's only one issue
with that.

13:22.636 --> 13:26.629
And that's that I need Aether to
be able to modulate a Trouble.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.214
So unless you know where a magic
Aether tree is,

13:29.309 --> 13:30.640
you're out of luck.

13:31.103 --> 13:32.138
- Where do you think
we're heading?

13:32.604 --> 13:33.593
(car rattles)

13:34.606 --> 13:37.268
- Well, you have all the
answers, don't you?

13:39.194 --> 13:40.559
(car rattles)

13:42.072 --> 13:43.061
- Get in the hatch
and cover up.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.488
- What... Oh, God.
That smells like feet.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.157
No, I'm not hiding under this.

13:48.245 --> 13:50.452
- Hold your breath or get shot,
your choice.

13:50.539 --> 13:51.699
- Are you threatening me?

13:51.790 --> 13:53.576
- Not me, sweetheart.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.156
Them.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.750
man: Now, you want me
to go another, uh...

14:06.763 --> 14:08.424
- Stan the man.
HoW's life?

14:09.182 --> 14:10.171
- All right.

14:10.308 --> 14:11.297
- You're gonna have
to turn around.

14:11.393 --> 14:12.382
Quarantine's in effect.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.472
- Well, you didn't get the word?

14:15.522 --> 14:18.639
Yeah, Dwight, uh, needed me
to run an errand, pronto.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.775
Look, I don't... I don't want
to get you a slap on the wrist

14:22.863 --> 14:25.195
so if you... call him
or whatever.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.033
- No, no.
That's fine.

14:27.117 --> 14:29.358
You know... quick once over your
vehicle, you're free to go.

14:29.619 --> 14:30.608
- Yeah.

14:31.538 --> 14:32.527
(door opening, keys rattling)

14:32.622 --> 14:34.954
Hey, just out of curiosity,
what, uh...

14:36.376 --> 14:37.877
(door closing)
What are you, uh...

14:38.253 --> 14:39.459
What are you guys looking for?

14:39.546 --> 14:42.083
- Apparently this whole mess is
'cause of food poisoning.

14:42.174 --> 14:43.789
I have to make sure you
don't bring any

14:43.884 --> 14:45.215
contaminated goods with you.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.004
Duke: You know, trust me.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.841
We both know this isn't food
poisoning, and you really don't

14:50.932 --> 14:52.092
want to look inside.

14:52.184 --> 14:54.846
- Why?
What skeletons am I gonna find?

14:55.020 --> 14:58.308
- Well, you know, okay.
Between you and me,

14:58.398 --> 15:00.889
it's just a little Jamaican
contraband that if you saw,

15:00.984 --> 15:02.099
you would have to confiscate.

15:02.194 --> 15:03.980
But if you didn't see, well...

15:04.571 --> 15:05.902
- Well, I really should.

15:06.782 --> 15:09.774
I can't let you proceed
without checking the trunk.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.401
- Don't move.

15:14.206 --> 15:15.195
(door opens)

15:16.208 --> 15:17.448
Here.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.954
This uh... this is for
being buds.

15:20.462 --> 15:22.123
Buds who...
(door closes)

15:22.214 --> 15:23.875
don't search other
bud's cars.

15:24.341 --> 15:25.330
(laughs)

15:25.425 --> 15:26.414
- Rum.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.218
- Yeah, what'd you think
it was?

15:30.388 --> 15:31.719
(chuckles)

15:31.807 --> 15:32.796
Eh...
(chuckles)

15:34.935 --> 15:36.846
- Go on.
- Okay.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.304
- Head through, Duke.

15:41.399 --> 15:42.388
(thumping)

15:43.026 --> 15:44.015
(door closes)

15:50.742 --> 15:54.451
- The gas leaks, motor vehicle
accidents, suicides.

15:54.538 --> 15:56.995
- Smoke and mirrors,
covering the Troubles.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.831
Starting to make more sense?
- Not really.

16:00.710 --> 16:03.702
But last month, an anemone was
discovered that could survive

16:03.797 --> 16:06.379
in the Antarctic and a
carnivorous plant was found

16:06.466 --> 16:07.455
in the Philippines.

16:07.926 --> 16:09.166
- You think I'm a new species?

16:10.053 --> 16:11.418
- I don't know what to think.

16:11.513 --> 16:14.846
But I'm having a hard time
believing in the supernatural.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.428
Science, however, explains why
you're not sick.

16:18.687 --> 16:20.678
- It's not the apple a day?
- Think about it.

16:20.772 --> 16:23.104
You're around the infected more
than anyone.

16:23.191 --> 16:25.978
But you're almost too healthy,
with all your muscles.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.434
- I guess I just got lucky.

16:27.529 --> 16:30.111
- Or, you're always on, right?

16:30.615 --> 16:32.196
Bullets are always
attracted to you.

16:32.284 --> 16:34.525
But if the contagion's
last phase is...

16:34.619 --> 16:36.359
- To trigger a person's Trouble.

16:36.454 --> 16:37.739
- But your Trouble's
already active.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.446
- Then I can't catch
the contagion.

16:39.541 --> 16:40.530
It's like chicken pox.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.365
If I get it once,
I can't get it again.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.121
- Somebody remembers
high school biology.

16:44.588 --> 16:47.204
- Wait... so couldn't you use
that basis, the fact that

16:47.299 --> 16:49.290
I can't get sick, as a means
to create a vaccine

16:49.384 --> 16:50.373
against the contagion?

16:50.468 --> 16:51.457
- Theoretically.

16:51.803 --> 16:53.759
It wouldn't save anyone,
but it might stop the spread.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.509
- Then we can immunize the
population before someone's

16:56.641 --> 16:58.848
Trouble goes off and liquefies
the town, or worse.

17:00.645 --> 17:01.634
- That could happen?

17:04.024 --> 17:06.436
I can't just snap my fingers.
Hypothetically, it would work.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.642
But...
(sighs)

17:09.571 --> 17:13.063
like any vaccine,
I would need a pure sample.

17:13.575 --> 17:15.657
Whatever it is that's causing
the disease.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.782
I need something
that creates Troubles.

17:24.836 --> 17:25.916
- I have just the thing.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.289
(circus music playing)

17:33.929 --> 17:34.918
(cell door sliding)

17:41.811 --> 17:43.472
- Did he rob a bank?

17:44.564 --> 17:45.849
I thought the bears stopped
appearing after you got

17:45.941 --> 17:46.930
Eve out of town.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.515
- Well, we missed one by
the hospital and now

17:48.610 --> 17:50.692
the pet store is overflowing
with his friends.

17:52.155 --> 17:54.942
- So I went through the delivery
addresses Kirby gave us

17:55.033 --> 17:57.024
and ruled out all but three.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.283
One of them's gotta be
the source of this

17:59.371 --> 18:00.531
Trouble contagion.

18:00.622 --> 18:01.611
(faint chatter)

18:07.212 --> 18:08.201
(door squeaking, closes)

18:15.095 --> 18:16.084
Everything okay?

18:18.431 --> 18:20.888
- Do you ever wonder
if I'm real?

18:23.603 --> 18:25.264
- What are you talking about?

18:30.151 --> 18:31.982
I lost my immunity
to the Troubles

18:32.070 --> 18:34.061
after I was split
from Mara.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.363
We don't even know how
that happened.

18:37.742 --> 18:40.074
Maybe Duke didn't separate me
from Mara.

18:40.745 --> 18:43.578
Maybe whatever Trouble
he used on her...

18:45.458 --> 18:46.447
created me.

18:48.586 --> 18:50.577
- You're real.
- You don't know that.

18:51.381 --> 18:52.370
- Yeah, I do.

18:55.343 --> 18:56.458
'Cause I love you.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.422
You love me.

18:59.723 --> 19:02.009
And no Douen, or golem,

19:02.100 --> 19:04.341
or dancing bear can do that.

19:06.855 --> 19:07.844
You're real, Parker.

19:07.939 --> 19:10.100
You have no... no reason
to think otherwise.

19:11.192 --> 19:12.181
(coughs)

19:13.486 --> 19:14.817
- Maybe I do.
(coughing)

19:16.281 --> 19:18.112
- Hey, you all right?

19:19.159 --> 19:22.117
(coughing continues)

19:27.792 --> 19:28.781
(indistinct intercom chatter)

19:31.296 --> 19:32.285
(elevator bell dings)

19:32.630 --> 19:35.121
- Audrey said she's feeling okay
now and I talked her into

19:35.216 --> 19:37.548
staying until the test results
come back.

19:37.719 --> 19:38.708
So what are we dealing with?

19:38.803 --> 19:39.963
- It's not good news, slim.

19:40.055 --> 19:42.797
There's no sign of a pathogen
in Audrey's blood work.

19:42.891 --> 19:46.224
So if it walks like a duck...
- It's the contagion.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.052
But Audrey doesn't have
those symptoms.

19:49.147 --> 19:51.058
- Well, diseases
can present differently.

19:51.149 --> 19:53.731
I'm sure you've gotten the flu
without a cough before, right?

19:53.818 --> 19:56.150
- But if Audrey has the
contagion, then...

19:57.113 --> 19:59.320
that means she's Troubled?

20:01.826 --> 20:03.657
But she's never shown any signs.

20:04.287 --> 20:06.619
- Things have changed.
- Then what's her Trouble?

20:07.415 --> 20:09.076
- Well, that's a good question.

20:09.501 --> 20:11.617
But if I were you, I wouldn't
wait around to find out.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.747
I would catch the person
who's causing the illness

20:13.838 --> 20:15.169
before Audrey goes off.

20:15.507 --> 20:18.169
- Hey, Audrey's not gonna want
to stick around,

20:18.343 --> 20:19.708
so keep an eye on her,
will you?

20:20.303 --> 20:24.091
- Two eyes, 'cause you guys
are cute together.

20:24.182 --> 20:25.171
(indistinct chatter)

20:25.475 --> 20:26.464
(phone rings)

20:27.060 --> 20:28.049
- Heard about Audrey.

20:28.603 --> 20:30.264
- She'll bounce back,
always does.

20:31.356 --> 20:33.472
- Have you heard from Duke?
- No, why would I?

20:33.566 --> 20:35.181
- Visited the hold.
No Mara.

20:35.276 --> 20:36.732
- What?

20:36.820 --> 20:37.809
Mara escaped?

20:39.030 --> 20:40.019
How?
- Duke.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.939
Not answering his phone calls
and avoiding my men.

20:43.034 --> 20:45.616
- Didn't give him much choice
after you zapped him.

20:45.703 --> 20:46.692
- That's no excuse.

20:47.705 --> 20:48.694
- Look, we'll find him.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.200
Right now, the contagion's
more important.

20:50.291 --> 20:52.577
- Agreed, that's why I need
the remaining Aether.

20:52.669 --> 20:53.954
Listen, if Charlotte
can study it,

20:54.045 --> 20:56.377
she might be able to create
a vaccine against the contagion.

20:57.340 --> 20:58.329
- You told her?

20:59.509 --> 21:00.749
- And I don't regret it.

21:02.262 --> 21:03.968
- I'm glad that you're
making headway.

21:04.055 --> 21:05.636
But with Mara on the run,
giving Charlotte Aether

21:05.723 --> 21:06.929
is asking for problems.

21:07.016 --> 21:08.631
- You know, I thought you'd be
all for this.

21:08.726 --> 21:10.557
A vaccine for what's making
Audrey sick.

21:10.854 --> 21:13.140
Who knows... if Charlotte's
successful, it could lead

21:13.231 --> 21:14.220
to a cure for the Troubles.

21:14.315 --> 21:16.601
- Keep your mad doctor
away from Audrey.

21:16.693 --> 21:17.682
(beeping over intercom)

21:17.777 --> 21:20.154
woman: Code orange. Code orange.
Irepeat, code orange.

21:20.238 --> 21:21.227
- What's the hurry?

21:21.322 --> 21:24.610
- An incoming mass casualty.
A chemical spill in the morgue.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.280
- All right,
that's no chemical spill.

21:29.372 --> 21:31.328
- Contagion must have activated
someone's Trouble.

21:31.416 --> 21:32.906
- That's exactly why we need
the vaccine.

21:33.001 --> 21:35.208
I'm giving Charlotte the rest
of the Aether.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.581
- I gave you the safe's
combination for insurance,

21:37.672 --> 21:38.661
not so you...

21:38.756 --> 21:41.338
- That's exactly why
you gave it to me.

21:41.426 --> 21:43.382
I do what you can't.

21:47.432 --> 21:48.638
(cell phone rings)

21:48.725 --> 21:49.714
(sighing)

21:50.018 --> 21:51.007
(clicks)

21:51.352 --> 21:52.341
- Yeah?

21:52.437 --> 21:54.393
Gloria: The boys in blue checked
out those addresses.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.392
Two were deliveries
to large parties.

21:56.483 --> 21:57.939
- 'Kay. Can't be our guy.

21:58.026 --> 21:59.857
Disease would have spread much
quicker-what's the third?

21:59.944 --> 22:02.936
- Single guy, lives alone.
Details coming to your phone.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.771
- Thanks.

22:05.533 --> 22:07.615
(phone chimes)

22:10.788 --> 22:11.777
(sighs)

22:11.873 --> 22:13.704
Great.

22:14.751 --> 22:15.740
(indistinct chatter)

22:16.544 --> 22:17.875
(dial clicking, foot steps)

22:18.546 --> 22:19.535
(indistinct chatter,
phone rings)

22:19.631 --> 22:20.837
(through wall)
man: All right, I'll do that.

22:20.924 --> 22:21.913
(safe clicks)
- Bingo.

22:22.926 --> 22:23.915
(deep breath)

22:24.010 --> 22:24.999
(scribbling)

22:25.428 --> 22:27.635
One more to go.
- Good.

22:27.764 --> 22:30.005
'Cause I'm getting bored
of watching the Keystone Cops

22:30.099 --> 22:32.476
out here, I can't even believe
they let us waltz in.

22:32.560 --> 22:36.223
- Well, this is Audrey's office.
And you do look like Audrey.

22:36.648 --> 22:39.981
- You don't have to remind me.
Place reeks of her.

22:40.109 --> 22:42.065
- You didn't seem to mind
playing dress up when I took

22:42.153 --> 22:43.142
your cuffs off you.

22:43.488 --> 22:44.819
- Would you hurry up?

22:45.532 --> 22:47.818
Are you sure that the Aether
fragments are even in there?

22:47.992 --> 22:50.074
- Nathan would stash his Bronco
in here if he could.

22:50.161 --> 22:51.276
(phone rings, faint chatter)
man: Yeah-yeah,

22:51.371 --> 22:53.362
I'll take it over.
- Almost there.

22:55.333 --> 22:56.322
(blind rattles)

22:57.335 --> 22:58.825
- Crap, hide.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.163
(door unlocking, opening)

23:10.807 --> 23:14.516
(dial clicking)

23:24.279 --> 23:25.268
(safe clicks)

23:26.614 --> 23:28.195
(safe door opening)

23:32.245 --> 23:33.451
(safe door shuts)

23:34.372 --> 23:35.361
(distant phone ringing)

23:37.208 --> 23:38.197
(door squeaking, shuts)

23:43.047 --> 23:44.423
(wheels clacking, chair thuds)

23:55.268 --> 23:56.257
(police radio chatter)

23:56.352 --> 23:57.341
(sighs)

23:57.520 --> 23:59.260
Now what, genius?

24:03.735 --> 24:04.724
(phone beeps)

24:05.111 --> 24:06.100
- Was that the governor?

24:06.195 --> 24:08.527
Did he remove the CDC
from Haven?

24:10.783 --> 24:12.444
- I checked up on you.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.320
You're no longer in charge
of the guard.

24:14.412 --> 24:17.074
- That shouldn't matter.
Lives are at risk.

24:17.999 --> 24:20.991
You need to call the governor.
- No, I don't.

24:21.586 --> 24:24.578
Now, I'm leaving and I suggest
you do too.

24:24.881 --> 24:27.122
Big city doesn't suit everyone,
Mr. Teagues.

24:28.426 --> 24:31.509
- I was in charge of the guard
when you miraculously found

24:31.596 --> 24:34.554
that scandalous information that
forced out the governor's rival.

24:34.641 --> 24:37.053
I could leak information
that was safe for me

24:37.143 --> 24:38.474
and ruin your career.

24:38.895 --> 24:41.432
That big city enough for you?

24:45.109 --> 24:46.098
(indistinct chatter)

24:47.320 --> 24:50.312
- Everyone took off when
the pools of acid appeared.

24:50.698 --> 24:52.029
It was a stampede.

24:53.618 --> 24:54.607
Screaming.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.620
- One of your patients had their
Trouble switched on

24:59.707 --> 25:00.696
by the contagion.

25:01.125 --> 25:02.831
- Um. Him.

25:03.795 --> 25:06.002
Melted a hole through
his own chest by accident.

25:06.339 --> 25:08.671
Took two people with him,
injured six.

25:09.133 --> 25:10.122
(taking deep breath)

25:11.052 --> 25:13.464
I froze.
I did nothing.

25:13.805 --> 25:15.716
- No, you were here.
That's something.

25:15.807 --> 25:17.798
- We have to end this, Nathan.

25:18.518 --> 25:20.600
Find who's ever behind
this outbreak.

25:24.982 --> 25:25.971
- I have, Pete.

25:27.652 --> 25:28.767
It's you.

25:35.868 --> 25:39.326
- Based on an R-nought
of four to seven

25:39.414 --> 25:40.620
and my movements...

25:40.832 --> 25:43.244
(breathing heavy)

25:44.085 --> 25:45.074
...you're right.

25:45.670 --> 25:47.001
I'm causing the epidemic.

25:48.673 --> 25:49.662
(hand slapping)

25:49.799 --> 25:52.131
I didn't even know
I was Troubled.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.885
My parents passed
when I was young.

25:57.014 --> 25:59.676
- Charlotte sniffing around your
reports probably triggered it.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.437
The Troubles have a tendency of
bringing out our worst fears.

26:03.521 --> 26:05.352
In your case, the contagion.

26:06.482 --> 26:07.858
(swishing)

26:08.192 --> 26:09.181
(scribbling)

26:09.277 --> 26:10.938
Pete, what are you doing?

26:11.112 --> 26:13.444
- Calculating the future spread
of the contagion.

26:13.531 --> 26:15.692
Um... It's like mumps, airborne.

26:15.783 --> 26:17.865
One person can infect
up to seven, who then in turn

26:17.952 --> 26:18.941
can do the same.

26:19.036 --> 26:20.025
Um...

26:21.122 --> 26:22.111
Eh...

26:22.540 --> 26:24.747
The amount of people
the contagion will force

26:24.834 --> 26:27.496
to express their Troubles
by the end of the day.

26:27.587 --> 26:29.202
Ah...

26:30.548 --> 26:31.537
Tomorrow.

26:35.470 --> 26:37.586
By the end of the week,
every Troubled person in Haven

26:37.680 --> 26:39.136
will have their Trouble turned
on and there's nothing

26:39.223 --> 26:41.054
we can do to stop them.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.314
- We have to stop this, Nathan,
before more people die

26:50.401 --> 26:51.390
because of me.

26:51.736 --> 26:53.567
- This isn't your fault.
And we will stop it.

26:53.821 --> 26:56.403
And to do that, I need you
to relax.

26:56.491 --> 26:58.482
Just focus.
Focus on your emotions.

26:58.701 --> 26:59.690
(erratic breathing)

26:59.786 --> 27:01.572
Breathe.
Come on.

27:02.580 --> 27:03.911
(exhaling)
Breathe.

27:04.749 --> 27:05.738
Good.

27:09.921 --> 27:11.081
- I can't, I can't, I can't!

27:11.923 --> 27:14.835
l-l don't... I don't deal
with emotions, Nathan.

27:14.926 --> 27:18.544
Okay, I deal with numbers
and figures, okay?

27:19.096 --> 27:20.757
- Okay, then focus on that.

27:22.183 --> 27:24.515
Here.
An equation or a number problem.

27:24.769 --> 27:25.758
Something.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.520
- (softly) Okay.

27:32.151 --> 27:35.063
l-l can't stop thinking about
the disease.

27:38.032 --> 27:39.021
Help me.

27:42.119 --> 27:43.108
- (softly) All right.

27:50.002 --> 27:50.991
- Need a break?

27:52.046 --> 27:53.206
- Not a good idea.

27:53.297 --> 27:55.413
I stop moving, I might actually
have to admit that everything

27:55.508 --> 27:57.169
I thought was true, isn't.

27:58.427 --> 27:59.416
- Not everything.

28:03.099 --> 28:04.088
- Look.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.887
I was in the Congo during
the height of Ebola.

28:06.978 --> 28:09.640
200 cases, three quarters
of which would die.

28:11.816 --> 28:15.479
I was running this autopsy when
I tore my containment suit.

28:17.488 --> 28:18.568
Do you know what I did?

28:19.824 --> 28:22.156
I kept going because
I knew that...

28:23.035 --> 28:24.696
even if I was infected,

28:24.829 --> 28:26.490
I could find a solution.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.661
But now I don't know.

28:31.752 --> 28:34.880
Mermen and golems, a family
who everything they touch

28:35.006 --> 28:35.995
turns to cake?

28:36.465 --> 28:39.457
Even if I believed any of this,
how would you stop it?

28:43.055 --> 28:45.046
- My Trouble first activated
in Afghanistan.

28:46.559 --> 28:49.221
Lit me up like Swiss cheese.
- Dwight, I'm...

28:50.313 --> 28:53.305
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
- Don't apologize.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.609
I was forced to believe
in the supernatural.

29:04.368 --> 29:05.699
You still have a choice.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.751
- Eppur si muove.

29:16.714 --> 29:17.703
- What?

29:18.215 --> 29:19.546
- And yet it moves.

29:20.885 --> 29:24.798
That's what Galileo said
when he was forced to deny

29:24.889 --> 29:27.096
that the earth revolves
around the sun.

29:27.850 --> 29:29.181
And yet it moves.

29:30.353 --> 29:33.937
Maybe the supernatural today
is just...

29:35.858 --> 29:37.519
science we don't yet comprehend.

29:39.487 --> 29:41.478
- So you think this will work?

29:44.492 --> 29:46.232
- I sure as hell hope so.

29:53.376 --> 29:54.707
(footsteps fading, door opens)

29:55.670 --> 29:56.659
(over intercom)
woman: Doctor Pearson,

29:56.754 --> 29:57.743
line ﬁve.
(door closes)

29:57.838 --> 29:58.827
Doctor Pearson, line ﬁve.

29:58.923 --> 30:00.959
- Kirk?
What are you doing here?

30:01.050 --> 30:03.041
If your Trouble activates...
- I'm fine.

30:03.803 --> 30:05.134
Not even a sniffle.

30:05.638 --> 30:07.128
But you must be sick
if you're in there playing with

30:07.223 --> 30:09.839
Bunsen burners while Troubles
are getting out of control.

30:09.934 --> 30:12.175
And guardsmen are confined
to their homes.

30:12.269 --> 30:13.850
- It's for their own protection,
and I don't remember asking

30:13.938 --> 30:14.927
for your input.

30:15.272 --> 30:16.773
- Well, maybe you should,
Dwight.

30:16.857 --> 30:19.849
What's your plan?
- Go home before you catch sick.

30:20.611 --> 30:21.771
I'm working on it.

30:22.738 --> 30:25.605
(indistinct chatter)

30:25.700 --> 30:26.689
(over intercom)
woman: Doctor Charles

30:26.784 --> 30:27.864
to radiology.

30:27.952 --> 30:29.738
Doctor Charles to radiology.

30:31.288 --> 30:32.619
(handle turns, door opens)

30:34.834 --> 30:37.166
(grunting)

30:38.462 --> 30:40.293
Duke: I really wish you
hadn't shown up, Kirk.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.163
(panting)

30:44.719 --> 30:45.879
You're up.

30:49.974 --> 30:51.635
(door creaks)

30:55.271 --> 30:57.978
(door opening, closes)

31:01.736 --> 31:03.567
(footsteps fading)

31:08.659 --> 31:09.648
(door creaking)

31:14.331 --> 31:15.457
(card sliding)

31:16.459 --> 31:17.448
(door opens)

31:20.171 --> 31:21.832
- Nathan?
Any luck?

31:22.214 --> 31:24.170
- Yeah.
- It's me.

31:24.258 --> 31:25.919
I'm responsible
for the contagion.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.378
- Finally, some good news.

31:27.678 --> 31:29.214
- It's not, I'm the worst person
to have a Trouble.

31:29.305 --> 31:31.261
He can't stop me.
- We're working on that.

31:31.348 --> 31:33.179
We're gonna see if Audrey can
help and we're trying

31:33.267 --> 31:34.256
to stay calm.

31:34.351 --> 31:35.340
- Yeah, that part's
kind of failing.

31:35.644 --> 31:36.633
- Maybe we should bring him
to Charlotte,

31:36.729 --> 31:37.935
she might be able
to do something.

31:38.022 --> 31:40.013
- She's a scientist,
not a miracle worker.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.392
(loud crash)

31:47.073 --> 31:48.358
- He's out cold.

31:49.366 --> 31:51.357
- I feel light headed.
Do you guys feel light headed?

31:53.370 --> 31:54.530
- He's right.

31:55.498 --> 31:56.908
(emergency alarm sounds)
I can't breath.

31:57.625 --> 31:58.865
Nathan: None of us can.

31:59.710 --> 32:01.371
Somebody's Trouble
just activated.

32:09.887 --> 32:11.752
(all gasping)
All right, let's think.

32:12.515 --> 32:15.131
Who do we know who's Trouble
can stop you from breathing?

32:15.267 --> 32:16.256
- Five minutes.

32:16.727 --> 32:19.639
Five minutes of no oxygen
and then brain damage.

32:20.064 --> 32:23.056
- It's Kirk.
He lied to me about being sick.

32:23.317 --> 32:26.809
His Trouble draws the oxygen
out of the air around him.

32:27.404 --> 32:28.393
(heavy breathing)

32:29.740 --> 32:33.073
- If he's in the building...
- Then we're losing oxygen fast.

32:34.745 --> 32:36.451
Get out of here.
I'll find Kirk.

32:36.539 --> 32:38.075
Take him to the safe location.

32:41.502 --> 32:42.491
- Audrey.

32:43.712 --> 32:44.701
Don't move.

32:44.797 --> 32:46.583
(both gasping)

32:51.929 --> 32:52.918
(oxygen hissing)
Come on.

32:53.472 --> 32:54.461
Pete: It's all my fault.

32:55.766 --> 32:56.755
(hissing)

32:57.852 --> 32:59.137
- You have to get out of here.

32:59.270 --> 33:03.138
If you pass out or die, this
contagion could go on forever.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.686
Pete?
Go.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.312
- Nathan.

33:12.408 --> 33:15.024
(door creaking,
gasping throughout)

33:17.830 --> 33:19.036
(cart rattles)

33:24.587 --> 33:25.576
(machine beeping)

33:33.721 --> 33:34.927
(gasping throughout)

33:35.014 --> 33:37.175
(clank)

33:41.145 --> 33:43.010
(paper shuffling)

33:46.317 --> 33:47.306
(gasping throughout)

33:52.323 --> 33:53.403
(rattling)

33:56.452 --> 33:59.068
(oxygen hissing)

34:06.212 --> 34:07.201
(thuds)

34:08.255 --> 34:10.632
(cart rattling,
distant screaming)

34:12.801 --> 34:13.790
(coughing)

34:14.345 --> 34:15.835
- Sir... sir, you have to
turn around.

34:15.930 --> 34:16.919
- What's happening?

34:17.348 --> 34:19.009
-Asmm
Pathogen, I think.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.594
- Lady, I'm from Haven.
Is it a Trouble?

34:21.685 --> 34:22.674
- I don't know.

34:22.937 --> 34:24.598
The air,
there's no oxygen.

34:24.688 --> 34:25.677
You can't go down there.

34:26.065 --> 34:27.054
- Yes, I can.

34:27.483 --> 34:28.472
Just get everyone out of here.

34:30.486 --> 34:31.475
(window thuds)

34:31.570 --> 34:34.357
(heavy inhaling, exhaling)

34:41.413 --> 34:42.402
(rattling)

34:43.082 --> 34:45.573
(gasping)

34:53.717 --> 34:54.968
- Finally.

34:55.052 --> 34:56.041
(groans)

34:57.388 --> 34:58.719
(rattling, clattering to floor)

34:59.723 --> 35:00.883
(wheezing)
- You.

35:02.726 --> 35:04.432
(clanking)
- Give me those!

35:07.064 --> 35:09.225
(wheezing)

35:11.443 --> 35:12.432
(gasping throughout)
- You deserve worse.

35:19.285 --> 35:20.274
Get out.

35:21.412 --> 35:23.869
The oxygen in the building...

35:24.581 --> 35:25.570
(thuds floor)

35:28.043 --> 35:29.704
- Yeah, lucky for me,
I enjoy free diving.

35:34.133 --> 35:35.543
(gasping)

35:36.260 --> 35:37.841
Hang on.

35:39.555 --> 35:40.544
(panting)

35:44.059 --> 35:45.048
(Mara gasping)

35:48.731 --> 35:49.766
Come on.

35:50.941 --> 35:52.602
Rise and shine, lazy bones.

35:53.527 --> 35:55.893
- Duke?
- Did you get it?

35:56.030 --> 35:59.614
- No.
G.l. Giant stopped me.

36:00.367 --> 36:01.356
- Then we're screwed.

36:02.244 --> 36:04.656
- So, what's the plan?

36:05.122 --> 36:06.453
Pete: You kill me.

36:06.749 --> 36:08.614
(birds chirping)

36:08.709 --> 36:09.698
- Pete?

36:10.878 --> 36:13.540
- It's me.
I'm responsible for all of this.

36:14.965 --> 36:18.048
The contagion is my Trouble
and no one can stop me.

36:18.135 --> 36:21.127
Nathan can't, Audrey caught it
and she's sick inside.

36:21.472 --> 36:23.258
- She what?
That's impossible.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.302
- Happy day, I'm about to become
an only child.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.509
- I know about
the Crocker curse.

36:30.064 --> 36:31.053
You can stop me.

36:31.148 --> 36:32.729
- Pete, you don't know what
you're talking about.

36:32.816 --> 36:35.478
- I do.
You kill me, my Trouble ends.

36:36.070 --> 36:37.651
I've spent my whole life
fudging reports

36:37.738 --> 36:39.399
to keep the Trouble secret.

36:42.826 --> 36:44.441
I'm not gonna be the one
who exposes them.

36:46.246 --> 36:48.862
- I'm sorry.
I can't.

36:54.129 --> 36:55.539
(Mara grunts, Pete gasps)

36:55.631 --> 36:56.871
(slicing, Pete grunts)

36:58.133 --> 36:59.122
(blood gushing)

37:01.970 --> 37:03.346
- I can.

37:10.062 --> 37:11.393
- What did you do?

37:12.272 --> 37:13.261
Are you nuts?

37:13.357 --> 37:15.473
If he dies, this disease could
last forever.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.103
- I did you a favor, all right.

37:17.194 --> 37:18.730
Now at least you're not
hemming and hawing.

37:18.821 --> 37:21.437
- There were options.
- Please.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.446
Come on, he doesn't have much
time left, all right.

37:23.534 --> 37:24.523
Finish him off.

37:25.869 --> 37:26.858
- No.
(breathing heavy)

37:28.122 --> 37:29.783
You're not gonna use me.

37:31.083 --> 37:32.072
This is wrong.

37:32.376 --> 37:33.365
- No.

37:33.502 --> 37:36.835
It's right.
Your friends are dying.

37:36.964 --> 37:39.546
Be a hero, end the contagion.

37:39.633 --> 37:43.251
Or else, poor Petey there
will die in vain.

37:44.388 --> 37:45.377
(Pete gasps)

37:48.100 --> 37:49.215
(sighs)

37:55.357 --> 37:57.063
(breathing heavy)

38:04.241 --> 38:05.230
(gasps)

38:24.261 --> 38:25.250
- You're okay?

38:25.596 --> 38:26.585
- Yeah.

38:28.140 --> 38:29.129
- See, what... what happened,
it was...

38:29.224 --> 38:30.805
- It was a Trouble.

38:30.893 --> 38:31.882
I get it.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.769
We're gonna figure out
how to cure them.

38:44.615 --> 38:45.946
- Nathan.
(taking deep breath)

38:47.618 --> 38:48.607
- (softly) Parker.

38:49.286 --> 38:50.275
- Hey.

38:52.789 --> 38:53.778
- (softly) Hey.

38:55.417 --> 38:56.748
You're all right?
- Yeah.

38:58.837 --> 38:59.826
We're all right.

39:01.298 --> 39:02.287
There's oxygen again.

39:04.426 --> 39:06.883
- I guess Pete must have
figured it out.

39:06.970 --> 39:07.959
(soft laugh)

39:10.682 --> 39:12.593
Things are finally starting
to look up.

39:16.480 --> 39:17.469
(coughing)

39:20.817 --> 39:21.806
You're still sick.

39:24.696 --> 39:25.947
How is that possible?

39:30.786 --> 39:32.117
(strap tapping, vehicle rattles)

39:38.752 --> 39:40.743
- I know what
you're going through.

39:43.006 --> 39:43.995
- That's rich.

39:45.217 --> 39:46.957
I thought killing
was a sport for you.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.041
- It wasn't always.

39:50.430 --> 39:51.761
It's like most things.

39:53.308 --> 39:54.718
Gets easier the more you do it.

39:57.271 --> 40:00.138
That's why I didn't trick you
into killing him.

40:00.232 --> 40:01.847
That's why it had to be
your choice.

40:02.859 --> 40:05.475
- You stabbed him.
- I did.

40:05.696 --> 40:08.278
Would you rather that I was
passive aggressive about it

40:08.365 --> 40:12.028
and showed you pictures of his
family members, like Audrey did

40:12.119 --> 40:14.110
when she wanted you
to kill someone?

40:14.204 --> 40:15.944
- What the hell are
you talking about?

40:16.540 --> 40:17.905
- You know what
I'm talking about.

40:19.501 --> 40:22.459
The Troubled man in the forest
that was murdering his children

40:22.546 --> 40:23.535
for their organs.

40:24.298 --> 40:26.459
Audrey manipulated you.

40:26.550 --> 40:27.539
I was up front.

40:28.552 --> 40:30.543
There's blood on my hands too.

40:31.263 --> 40:33.254
- So, what, you want a medal?

40:33.599 --> 40:34.588
- No, Duke.

40:37.436 --> 40:39.017
I want to fix you.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.093
(scoffs)

40:40.814 --> 40:41.803
- Right.

40:42.024 --> 40:45.357
- I can stop you from ever
needing to kill someone.

40:46.903 --> 40:50.395
I can stop you from ever needing
to vent a Trouble.

40:50.657 --> 40:51.646
- And I'm supposed to believe

40:51.742 --> 40:54.529
you're not planning on gutting
me because?

40:54.995 --> 40:55.984
(handcuffs rattling)

40:57.414 --> 40:58.403
(clicking)

41:01.209 --> 41:02.198
(clicking)

41:04.296 --> 41:05.627
- Because you know I won't.

41:06.256 --> 41:07.587
It's like you said...

41:08.884 --> 41:11.216
(rattling)
we're on our own.

41:21.438 --> 41:23.554
(typing)

41:26.777 --> 41:27.766
- What's wrong?

41:28.070 --> 41:30.231
- I suggested to the governor
that he order the CDC

41:30.322 --> 41:31.311
out of Haven.

41:32.574 --> 41:33.563
- Did he refuse?

41:34.117 --> 41:35.106
- No.

41:36.745 --> 41:39.612
- Then I'm struggling to see
what the problem is.

41:41.208 --> 41:44.291
- The CDC denies having any
personnel in Haven.

41:52.552 --> 41:52.586
J‘J‘

41:52.594 --> 41:55.552
J‘J‘
