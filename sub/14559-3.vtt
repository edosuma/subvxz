WEBVTT

00:03.904 --> 00:06.507
(engine revving)

00:13.647 --> 00:17.985
* Mmm... mmm

00:18.052 --> 00:21.455
* Life changes happen
every day *

00:21.522 --> 00:24.258
* The place to make your pay

00:24.325 --> 00:26.327
* Life changes
happen every day *

00:26.394 --> 00:28.596
* The place to make your pay

00:28.662 --> 00:35.203
* See the skyline
for the very first time *

00:35.269 --> 00:39.073
Hey. Double-shot,
nonfat macchiato.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.009
Newest copy of Shredsled.

00:42.076 --> 00:43.511
Mm! Wow!
Thank you.

00:46.414 --> 00:47.548
Hey, Bobby.
How's your night going?

00:47.615 --> 00:48.849
I've got nothing to
complain about, Sam.

00:48.916 --> 00:49.883
How about you?

00:49.950 --> 00:51.585
Beautiful night,
business is good...

00:51.652 --> 00:53.020
What's not to like?

00:53.087 --> 00:54.555
I hear you, bro.

00:56.657 --> 01:00.027
(engine racing)

01:00.094 --> 01:02.563
(tires screeching)

01:17.044 --> 01:19.613
No.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.752
(screaming, shouting)

01:30.824 --> 01:34.228
MAN (in distance):
Somebody call an ambulance!

01:37.998 --> 01:39.700
Hey, is that your stuff?

01:39.767 --> 01:42.436
Yeah, Quantico
sent it all back,

01:42.503 --> 01:44.638
minus some files
and my date book, but...

01:44.705 --> 01:47.675
Well, I'd really like it
if someone cleaned off my desk.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.443
Yeah, right. Thank you.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.480
Hey, man.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.847
Hey.

01:53.914 --> 01:54.848
(phone rings)

01:54.915 --> 01:56.317
Sinclair.

01:56.384 --> 01:58.252
I guess they didn't return
all my personal stuff.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.520
What are you
talking about?

01:59.587 --> 02:01.255
I'm missing a paperweight
and a fishing lure.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.857
A Wooly Bugger.
A what?!

02:03.924 --> 02:06.194
My, uh, my dad
made it for me. It's...

02:06.260 --> 02:07.595
A Wooly Bugger, huh?

02:07.661 --> 02:09.830
LAPD just called us
in on a car accident.

02:09.897 --> 02:10.864
They want us to take the lead.

02:10.931 --> 02:11.899
It was on the news last night.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.501
A car crashed
into a crowded coffee house.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.935
What's that got
to do with us?

02:15.002 --> 02:16.504
VIN numbers on the
car's parts don't match.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.339
They are stolen cars from
three different states.

02:18.406 --> 02:20.208
We've got one dead
and eight injured.

02:20.274 --> 02:22.543
All righty, let's do it.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.180
(helicopter passing)

02:26.247 --> 02:29.617
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

02:29.683 --> 02:31.885
DAVID: Miracle more people
weren't killed.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.153
Well, who was the driver?

02:33.221 --> 02:35.289
17-year-old, Kyle Clippard.

02:35.356 --> 02:36.724
Critical condition
with head injuries.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.726
Still unconscious.

02:38.792 --> 02:42.463
What was this like, uh...
street racer or something, huh?

02:42.530 --> 02:44.432
The tires are wide,
low profile--

02:44.498 --> 02:45.599
that's the type they use.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.900
Where do you get
a car like this?

02:46.967 --> 02:49.437
I don't know.
No registered ownership.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.472
The car's a mix
of stolen parts.

02:51.539 --> 02:52.873
The driver has
a provisional license,

02:52.940 --> 02:54.742
not even supposed
to be driving at night.

02:54.808 --> 02:58.145
LAPD is still
questioning the witnesses.

02:58.212 --> 02:59.413
WOMAN:
The car came out of nowhere.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.282
I didn't see it
until the last minute.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.683
I don't know about this guy--

03:02.750 --> 03:05.286
if he was racing or just...
driving crazy.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.187
I mean,
it's like he drove right at us.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.722
MAN: I was just making my
delivery.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.891
It all happened so fast.

03:10.958 --> 03:15.796
The car was on the sidewalk
and knocking people over.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.332
Hey, careful there.

03:18.399 --> 03:19.400
Hey. Yeah.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.034
Just drove
right into the place.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.537
Well, the LAPD accident
analysis should tell you

03:23.604 --> 03:24.905
how that happened, right?

03:24.972 --> 03:26.574
Thing is, I got to find out why.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.541
That's tricky--
finding motives

03:27.608 --> 03:29.810
in skid marks and
trajectories, you know.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.713
That's what we got
you for, right?

03:36.016 --> 03:38.185
MAN: I don't know how Kyle got
that car,

03:38.252 --> 03:40.621
or why he was driving it.

03:40.688 --> 03:41.955
So you've never seen
the car before?

03:42.022 --> 03:43.457
No.

03:43.524 --> 03:44.725
Does your son have
any reason

03:44.792 --> 03:45.593
to be depressed?

03:45.659 --> 03:46.927
Was he upset
about anything?

03:46.994 --> 03:49.530
You mean,
did he do this on purpose?

03:49.597 --> 03:52.132
No, that's not Kyle.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.534
He's a happy kid.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.769
He's got friends, a job...

03:55.836 --> 03:56.904
DOCTOR:
Nothing new.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.706
We'll know more
after a few hours.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.809
Excuse us. I need to have
a few words with the agents.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.545
Thank you.

04:08.215 --> 04:09.983
(door closes)

04:10.050 --> 04:11.251
Is the kid going
to wake up?

04:11.319 --> 04:13.186
Too soon to say.
Maybe not.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.722
But here's the thing:

04:14.788 --> 04:16.957
you're looking
at two sets of injuries.

04:17.024 --> 04:17.758
Two?

04:17.825 --> 04:20.761
One from the accident--
broken clavicle,

04:20.828 --> 04:22.830
crushed ribs,

04:22.896 --> 04:23.964
then there's this.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.566
He sustained heavy blows

04:25.633 --> 04:28.569
to the left side
of his face and skull.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.472
Is that a... a shoe print?

04:31.539 --> 04:33.307
Somebody kicked him in the head.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.175
Before of after the accident?

04:35.242 --> 04:36.710
It had to be after.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.647
I can't imagine him driving
with that type of head injury.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.048
Somebody from
the accident scene.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.651
Somebody with a lot of rage

04:43.717 --> 04:45.919
who couldn't help
but express it.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.764
DAVID: If the driver was
attackedafter the accident,

04:56.830 --> 04:58.532
how come no witness
mentioned it?

04:58.599 --> 05:00.601
Because they identify
with the assailant.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.536
They think the driver
had it coming.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.705
Like that case in Texas, where
the mob killed that man

05:04.772 --> 05:06.273
that was in a car
that injured a child.

05:06.340 --> 05:09.677
Yeah, except by all accounts,
Kyle Clippard's a good kid.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.645
He's friendly,
he's hard-working.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.814
It doesn't make sense--
mowing down all those people.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.417
Maybe even good kids
need to race?

05:16.484 --> 05:17.851
No one saw a second car.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.420
Maybe because they were
too focused on the car

05:19.487 --> 05:21.889
about to hit them.

05:23.857 --> 05:27.828
Oh, by the way, uh, what is
Colby Granger up to now?

05:27.895 --> 05:29.997
Uh, well, actually,
he just got offered

05:30.063 --> 05:33.133
a great job opportunity
down at the DC office.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.802
Really?
Yeah.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.070
He's sort of a hero now, right?

05:37.137 --> 05:38.171
Not sort of.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.908
He was awarded the FBI Medal
of Meritorious Conduct, right?

05:40.974 --> 05:43.611
Yeah, though, he's not sure
he wants to leave L.A.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.479
Why? Is there a place
for him here?

05:45.546 --> 05:48.382
It's a little awkward, you know.

05:48.449 --> 05:51.151
I mean, basically, he's been
reporting on all of us

05:51.218 --> 05:53.020
for two years now, so...

05:53.086 --> 05:55.889
ALAN: Well, you file reports on
everything you do, anyway.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.391
Don't you? I mean,
it's all above board, right?

05:57.458 --> 06:00.160
What do you got there, pal?

06:00.227 --> 06:01.662
Uh, that article I wrote,

06:01.729 --> 06:04.064
"A Mathematical Analysis
of Friendship Dynamics."

06:04.131 --> 06:04.898
Yeah, yeah.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.300
McCadden Books wants
to publish it...

06:07.367 --> 06:08.769
Huh.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.904
...but not as a textbook,
as a self-help book.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.305
What do you mean,
for regular people?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.908
For regular people-- they say
it'd be a strong seller,

06:14.975 --> 06:17.878
something like
"the science of popularity."

06:17.945 --> 06:19.747
Well, you better simplify
the math then, huh?

06:19.813 --> 06:21.582
I could reach a lot of people

06:21.649 --> 06:24.051
who would never be caught dead
reading a math book.

06:26.687 --> 06:27.988
DAVID:
LAPD says street racing is

06:28.055 --> 06:30.023
is big in the neighborhoods
around that coffee shop.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.893
Mostly young, male drivers
in customized imports.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.295
So the other racers
might know who our guy is?

06:35.362 --> 06:37.965
Maybe even where he got his car?
Yeah.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.434
If you guys want, I can help you
run some of that stuff down.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.102
Yeah, that'd be great.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.316
BOBBY:
I still can't believe it.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.351
Sam was a real good guy.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.687
Seems like
everyone knows

06:59.753 --> 07:02.089
each other pretty well
on this street.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.958
We see each
other every day.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.194
Making deliveries
in this neighborhood.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.428
You get to know people.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.931
Yeah, well, I'd like to ask you
a few questions

07:10.998 --> 07:14.568
about what happened
right after the accident.

07:14.635 --> 07:17.505
Sure. Anything I can do to help.

07:22.009 --> 07:25.813
The wise old man comes
down from the mountain.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.415
Now, listen. Firstly, I come
down not from the mountains

07:28.482 --> 07:30.117
but from the foothills.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.084
Secondly, I am not old,

07:31.151 --> 07:33.053
certainly not by
today's standards.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.255
And thirdly, being wiser
than present company

07:35.322 --> 07:38.726
does not signify the breach
of a noteworthy threshold.

07:38.792 --> 07:42.095
Hmm. I see that you're reading
Dr. Preskill's paper

07:42.162 --> 07:45.298
on "Anomalies and Fermion Masses
in D Dimensions."

07:45.365 --> 07:46.266
You thinking of
a change of focus?

07:46.333 --> 07:47.635
I'm thinking of a lot of things,

07:47.701 --> 07:50.103
that is, when I'm not trying
to think of nothing.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.238
Well, listen. I have this
problem for the FBI--

07:51.304 --> 07:52.840
advanced accident
analysis,

07:52.906 --> 07:54.241
and I could really
use your insight,

07:54.307 --> 07:56.644
if you're done soul-searching.
-I am all booked this afternoon

07:56.710 --> 07:58.311
during meditation,
pond maintenance

07:58.378 --> 07:59.947
and garden duty.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.683
I will, however, give you
a name-- Raymond Galuski.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.384
Galuski,
that's engineering, right?

08:04.451 --> 08:06.053
Mechanical engineering.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.221
Most engineers love
to make things,

08:08.288 --> 08:10.090
and they hate it
when something doesn't work.

08:10.157 --> 08:13.260
But figuring out why something
crashed, broke or blew up--

08:13.326 --> 08:16.063
for me-- is when the fun starts.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.766
Last accident I analyzed was
when the Mars Rover

08:18.832 --> 08:20.868
fell into a shallow crater
during a Martian sandstorm.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.470
Well, this occurred a little
closer to home,

08:23.537 --> 08:26.807
although, possibly more
complicated.

08:26.874 --> 08:30.310
Mechanical engineering--
the poetry of matter and energy,

08:30.377 --> 08:31.679
of metal and power.

08:31.745 --> 08:34.715
The more complicated it is,
the more beautiful it becomes.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.183
Well, listen, we need to know

08:36.249 --> 08:37.785
if a certain vehicle's
trajectory

08:37.851 --> 08:39.687
was accidental or intended.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.354
My own computer
modeling software

08:41.421 --> 08:44.357
analyzes anything
with an engine.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.694
(electronic trilling)

08:48.796 --> 08:52.032
Hey, David... I've been
working on a list

08:52.099 --> 08:54.367
of known and suspected
street racers.

08:54.434 --> 08:55.202
Right.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.203
Check it out. I found this.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.372
Six cases of vandalism
in five months

08:59.439 --> 09:00.674
on the same speed camera.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.509
Just two blocks
from the accident site.

09:02.576 --> 09:03.644
Yeah, someone out there

09:03.711 --> 09:05.145
doesn't want to be
caught going fast.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.380
Looks like you're looking
at an all-night stakeout, man.

09:07.447 --> 09:10.083
Yeah, you up for it?

09:10.150 --> 09:13.787
Actually, you know what?
Why don't I take it?

09:13.854 --> 09:16.356
Why don't you take
the night off?

09:16.423 --> 09:18.291
All right?

09:31.004 --> 09:32.973
So, you know what
I just learned?

09:33.040 --> 09:34.541
The first speed-trap camera
was actually invented

09:34.608 --> 09:36.977
by a race driver
to improve his time.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.846
Huh.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.284
Come on, man, you better
have some conversation.

09:44.351 --> 09:48.789
We're going to be here
a while, you know.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.759
Nothing you want to talk about?

09:51.825 --> 09:54.194
I don't know,
I guess, uh...

09:54.261 --> 09:56.296
the right thing to do
is take that DC job.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.033
That depends what you want.
-Yeah, well, what I want

10:00.100 --> 10:02.803
I mean, is to go back
and start over.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.537
Have a regular job
at the Bureau.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.473
No lying, no pretending.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.208
You know?
Well, then the question is

10:08.275 --> 10:11.178
is can you be happy with
a regular job at the Bureau?

10:11.244 --> 10:13.346
I mean, that's
what I set out to do.

10:13.413 --> 10:14.648
If I wanted
to be a spy,

10:14.715 --> 10:17.017
I would have applied
somewhere else.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.820
Look, most of us have to do
undercover at some point.

10:19.887 --> 10:22.055
Yeah, but not
in your own office.

10:23.556 --> 10:25.926
I don't know, what do you think
of the chances

10:25.993 --> 10:27.661
of me coming back
to work for the team?

10:35.335 --> 10:36.670
Check it out.

10:43.510 --> 10:44.477
Let's go, buddy.

10:44.544 --> 10:45.913
Whoa, whoa, wait...
Put your hands behind your back.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.547
Got anything that's gonna hurt
us?

10:47.614 --> 10:49.349
No, uh-uh.
What's your name?

10:49.416 --> 10:51.018
Ernie.
Ernest Fuller.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.185
You got a race tonight,
Ernie?

10:52.252 --> 10:53.153
Nah, I don't know
what you're talking about.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.354
Oh, you don't know
what I'm talking about?

10:54.421 --> 10:57.758
(engines revving,
tires screeching)

11:01.895 --> 11:03.430
(driver yelping)

11:05.298 --> 11:06.967
I have a feeling
those guys know

11:07.034 --> 11:08.769
what we're talking about.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.413
Is this the dude from that big
crash? -Yeah.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.649
You know him?

11:22.716 --> 11:24.417
I've seen him around.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.453
The night of the crash,
what did you see?

11:26.519 --> 11:27.821
Who was out racing?

11:27.888 --> 11:29.656
Um, I don't know.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.691
I was home,
I was working on my car.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.660
All right,
maybe you were out there

11:33.727 --> 11:35.195
with Kyle Clippard
when he crashed.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.831
No, 'cause I wrecked
my car two weeks ago.

11:37.898 --> 11:38.999
You can ask around.

11:39.066 --> 11:39.967
Who was racing Kyle?

11:40.033 --> 11:42.402
I... I don't know.

11:42.469 --> 11:45.172
Uh, maybe
if you described the car?

11:51.644 --> 11:53.013
Does Kyle Clippard
own that car?

11:53.080 --> 11:55.783
You know what,
that's hard to say.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.217
Okay, you've got
to understand.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.652
The guys, they trade cars
all the time.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.988
They win them in races.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.923
Maybe he borrowed it
or, you know,

12:02.990 --> 12:04.291
he could've stole it.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.263
You're going to
give me the names

12:10.330 --> 12:11.999
of the people that
race that neighborhood.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.300
Why the hell should I?

12:13.366 --> 12:15.836
The man that died
had a lot to live for.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.105
He gave up his life
protecting a little girl

12:18.171 --> 12:20.307
from somebody just like you.

12:22.742 --> 12:28.148
50,000 street racers
just like yourself,

12:28.215 --> 12:30.050
they die in crashes
every year.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.484
Only problem I have with that is

12:31.551 --> 12:33.453
every now and again
they hurt somebody else.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.122
So listen, you.

12:35.188 --> 12:39.359
You smarten up and you give me
some names right now.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.332
Okay.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.800
But, uh...

12:46.867 --> 12:50.037
the cops, they know
most of them already.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.239
(engine revving,
tires screeching)

12:53.907 --> 12:56.176
Well, that was craptastic.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.211
That's one way of
putting it, yeah.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.680
This model should recreate
the events of the accident,

13:00.747 --> 13:02.182
but it's not working.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.583
Hey, Charlie?
Where's the oil pan?

13:03.650 --> 13:05.853
I have to change
the oil in my car.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.220
Oh, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.122
Doing it yourself,
good for you.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.091
Few things in life
more satisfying

13:11.158 --> 13:12.225
than performing
basic auto maintenance.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.027
ALAN:
Yeah, also it's cheaper,

13:14.094 --> 13:15.628
and I'm ensured
that it gets done right,

13:15.695 --> 13:16.830
if you know what I mean.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.066
You, sir, are a man of a deep
and profound common sense.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.168
(Charlie chuckles)
Well, thank you.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.903
Dad, this is
Dr. Ray Galuski

13:22.970 --> 13:24.938
He's helping me
perform a mathematical

13:25.005 --> 13:26.940
analysis of this
crash here.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.108
Where's the math?

13:28.175 --> 13:29.542
I just see a couple
of lines on a road.

13:29.609 --> 13:32.245
It's embedded in the model. -A
computer simulation is just

13:32.312 --> 13:35.082
a mathematical representation
of the real world.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.349
Sir Isaac Newton--

13:36.416 --> 13:39.853
he observed
a real-world event: gravity.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.122
He then created
a mathematical model

13:42.189 --> 13:45.025
to represent that phenomenon,
which he could then

13:45.092 --> 13:47.327
extrapolate to predict
the orbits of planets,

13:47.394 --> 13:50.230
the general structure
and movements of galaxies.

13:50.297 --> 13:53.433
The problem is,
our model doesn't match reality.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.401
Car's not crashing.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.469
It's not the friction circle
expressions, right?

13:56.536 --> 13:57.770
I mean, they seem dead-on.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.272
ALAN:
Friction circle theory!

13:59.339 --> 14:02.876
Yeah, planners use it to
analyze soil slope stability.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.111
You know, for, uh...
building foundations.

14:04.177 --> 14:07.047
One and the same, my friend.

14:07.114 --> 14:08.882
Friction keeps a car
on the road during a turn.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.284
CHARLIE:
The car in this case

14:11.351 --> 14:14.487
broke the friction,
so it had

14:14.554 --> 14:16.056
to have been going faster,

14:16.123 --> 14:19.927
or been heavier
than reported.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.198
About 260 pounds heavier.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.168
So where did this 260 pounds go?

14:34.874 --> 14:38.011
Why wouldn't they haved
returned all of Colby's stuff?

14:38.078 --> 14:39.246
I don't know.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.148
Maybe somebody thought
it wasn't important.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.017
I guess his dad can make him
another fishing lure.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.519
Colby's dad died
when he was 15.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.488
Oh.

14:48.555 --> 14:52.259
So, we've come upon the
slightest conundrum.

14:52.325 --> 14:53.726
This is Dr. Raymond Galuski.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.362
Ray. Some call me Ray-Ray.

14:55.428 --> 14:56.429
Okay.

14:56.496 --> 14:59.266
Ray-Ray is a mechanical
engineer.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.201
He's helping me
with the accident analysis.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.170
I just make it look cool
on the computer.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.505
CHARLIE: We think that the car
from the crash

15:05.572 --> 15:07.907
was 260 pounds heavier

15:07.975 --> 15:09.742
during the accident
than it is now.

15:09.809 --> 15:11.844
What would account for the
weight? GALUSKI: No idea.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.846
We just know it was there. -Are
you sure that there wasn't

15:13.913 --> 15:15.615
a second person
in that car?

15:15.682 --> 15:18.185
260 pounds, that's
a really big person,

15:18.251 --> 15:20.087
but I guess it's possible.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.621
And if there was
a second person,

15:21.688 --> 15:24.057
maybe he could tell us
who attacked the driver.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.325
Or maybe it was driver

15:25.392 --> 15:28.061
and the injured kid
was a passenger.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.530
Maybe there was
a dead body in the trunk.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.433
A dead body that got up
and walked away after the crash?

15:34.534 --> 15:36.203
(chuckling):
I'm just an engineer.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.912
Give me.

15:45.979 --> 15:48.448
I know, she's
letting me win.

15:48.515 --> 15:51.884
Now, Larry,
that is not true.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.853
Amita, you're coddling me.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.823
No, she's strangling you.

15:56.889 --> 15:58.525
Sorry, Larry, it's a trap.

15:58.591 --> 15:59.892
ALAN: You see, your problem is
you keep

15:59.959 --> 16:01.361
thinking of other things
when you play.

16:01.428 --> 16:04.097
That's not true--
other things keep thinking me.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.532
Now, wait a sec,
what if I move...?

16:05.598 --> 16:07.234
Nah, you're, you're a goner.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.601
Are you looking for Charlie?

16:08.668 --> 16:10.870
No, actually, I was looking
for you-- I found this

16:10.937 --> 16:11.971
and I thought you might need it.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.406
Thank you.
ALAN: Yeah.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.242
I've been looking for this
every-- where did you find it?

16:15.308 --> 16:16.843
On the hallway floor.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.312
Oh, sorry.

16:19.379 --> 16:20.013
Hmm?

16:20.080 --> 16:21.314
I'll try not to leave

16:21.381 --> 16:22.349
my stuff lying around.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.583
No big deal,
we're all adults.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.952
When I was your age,
I was married...

16:26.019 --> 16:27.487
and I already had a kid.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.858
Larry, how are things
with you and Megan?

16:31.924 --> 16:33.593
Oh, going beautifully, I think.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.595
I mean, we're spending
all of our time apart,

16:35.662 --> 16:37.764
so it's a little difficult
to assess.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.632
Does that address
your question?

16:42.902 --> 16:44.971
MATT:
David.

16:45.038 --> 16:47.307
Look, these weld points?

16:47.374 --> 16:49.442
They mean that the
original front grill

16:49.509 --> 16:50.410
was replaced with this one.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.179
So this grill used to be
on a different car?

16:52.245 --> 16:54.681
Exactly, and when I looked
a little closer,

16:54.747 --> 16:56.449
I found, ta-da!

16:56.516 --> 16:58.385
Traces of hair and
blood in the crevices.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.420
But not from this recent crash.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.355
DNA matches two victims
of an unsolved

17:02.422 --> 17:04.424
hit-and-run that happened
three years ago.

17:04.491 --> 17:07.494
That's Daniel and Caren Kaufman.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.196
Nothing was found
at the crime scene.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.198
This is the first
evidence in this case.

17:11.264 --> 17:13.032
CHARLIE: I don't think Kyle
Clippard did that,

17:13.100 --> 17:15.302
'cause he would've been
14 years old at the time.

17:15.368 --> 17:18.538
Three years ago, this grill was
on a car involved in a fatality.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.873
Right now it's
on a second car,

17:20.940 --> 17:22.142
also in a fatal accident?

17:22.209 --> 17:23.476
That's some kind

17:23.543 --> 17:25.612
of coincidence.
Not if street racing was

17:25.678 --> 17:26.679
involved in both cases.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.615
GALUSKI: There's one thing about
street racing--

17:28.681 --> 17:30.317
those dudes crash.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.490
Oh, Dr. Galuski?

17:37.557 --> 17:38.791
I'm sure you could
make your point

17:38.858 --> 17:41.394
without getting grease stains
all over the FBI's nice office.

17:41.461 --> 17:42.462
Do you know what this is?

17:42.529 --> 17:44.664
Uh, it's a differential.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.533
It's a...

17:47.600 --> 17:48.268
Okay,

17:48.335 --> 17:49.636
so you know
that when a car

17:49.702 --> 17:52.272
makes a turn, the wheels don't
all turn at the same speed.

17:52.339 --> 17:54.474
Because of a phenomenon
related to centripetal force.

17:54.541 --> 17:57.144
You know, when a car turns,
it's on a circular path.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.746
So the farther
from the center of the circle,

17:59.812 --> 18:01.448
the greater
the distance traveled.

18:01.514 --> 18:02.515
It's like on a carousel

18:02.582 --> 18:05.352
where a horse on the
outside travels further

18:05.418 --> 18:08.388
than one on the inside,
so it's got to go faster,

18:08.455 --> 18:10.857
same with
the drive wheels on a car.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.592
The outside wheels
travel further, to

18:12.659 --> 18:15.562
keep up with the inside tires
they have to spin faster.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.164
If a car didn't have
a differential,

18:17.230 --> 18:18.365
the outside tires
couldn't keep up.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.800
They'd be dragged
across the pavement.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.101
Is there something
unique about this one?

18:22.169 --> 18:23.736
LSD.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.238
Limited Slip Differential.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.739
Two-way clutch type
used by drifters.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.542
Drifters are street racers
who take high-speed turns,

18:29.609 --> 18:31.211
and then they let
the rear wheels

18:31.278 --> 18:33.246
slide out on purpose.
And this one's

18:33.313 --> 18:35.248
an OX Gekko Ultra Lock.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.416
Only a few places
you can get one.

18:36.483 --> 18:39.219
And I'm guessing, Ray-Ray,

18:39.286 --> 18:40.853
that you know
a few of those places?

18:44.257 --> 18:46.759
(hip-hop beat playing)

18:51.063 --> 18:53.099
* Hey

18:53.166 --> 18:54.701
* This is my block

18:54.767 --> 18:55.502
* Hey

18:55.568 --> 18:57.870
* Where everybody know you

18:57.937 --> 18:59.572
* And they show you
what's good *

18:59.639 --> 19:01.441
* Gotta love the feeling...

19:01.508 --> 19:03.810
Looking for a Dominator
fuel injection system.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.578
That's illegal
on California streets.

19:05.645 --> 19:09.316
How about
an Ultra Lock Two-Way?

19:09.382 --> 19:11.117
Strike two--
Ultra Lock's not distributed

19:11.184 --> 19:12.519
in the States.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.653
I guess we came
to the wrong place.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.189
Hey, hold up.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.157
That's not to say
that the Ultra Lock

19:18.225 --> 19:20.026
can't be bought.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.294
Can we take one home today?

19:23.129 --> 19:25.532
Just stay right there.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.700
Actually, how about you
stay right there.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.536
FBI.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.706
(clanging)

19:34.774 --> 19:36.676
Hey, get back here!

19:39.412 --> 19:41.714
Get down! Get over here!

19:42.849 --> 19:44.183
Hey idiot,
this guy's with the FBI.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.418
Where you gonna go?
Come on, man.

19:45.485 --> 19:46.453
I just work here.
Huh?

19:46.519 --> 19:47.520
They tell me to sell the stuff.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.622
Is that what your boss
is going to say?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.224
Okay, so I make a little
on the side.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.892
But you don't want me.
Oh, we don't, huh?

19:52.959 --> 19:55.194
No, I'm a nobody. I'll give you
the guy who sells to me.

19:55.262 --> 19:57.230
He sells to, like,
half a dozen shops.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.699
Tell me this,
did you sell an Ultra Lock

19:59.766 --> 20:01.200
to this kid?

20:02.735 --> 20:04.804
Okay, yeah.

20:04.871 --> 20:05.538
Yeah, three weeks ago.

20:05.605 --> 20:08.875
That's awesome. Come on.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.076
DAVID: Did you know your son
like to go to

20:10.142 --> 20:11.644
street racing meets?

20:11.711 --> 20:14.914
That he bought auto parts
designed for racing?

20:14.981 --> 20:16.883
No.
Mm-hmm.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.651
He told me he was
out with friends.

20:18.718 --> 20:22.589
That they went to movies,
other kids' houses.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.426
I trusted my son.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.528
What if you're wrong about Kyle?

20:28.595 --> 20:30.530
You don't know why
that car crashed,

20:30.597 --> 20:32.265
or why Kyle was in it.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.601
Somebody tried to kill my son.

20:34.667 --> 20:37.236
We don't know his side of it.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.472
He can't tell us what happened.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.910
COLBY:
Hey, Megan.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.813
I got something.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.882
So street racers are
into posting their videos

20:49.949 --> 20:50.817
of their races online.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.652
I figure if our crash
had anything to do

20:52.719 --> 20:55.021
with that, it might be worth
checking a few Web sites.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.524
I found this video posted
a couple hours ago.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.527
GIRL:
Oh, my God.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.162
Someone filmed the accident?
Yeah.

21:03.229 --> 21:05.632
And they couldn't have been more
than 25 feet north of the site.

21:05.698 --> 21:08.335
This is all that
was posted online,

21:08.401 --> 21:11.471
but I'm thinking
there might be more.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.642
Oh, my...

21:16.543 --> 21:17.777
COLBY:
Hey, Nitrogurl.

21:17.844 --> 21:20.647
That's you, isn't it? -What you
girls looking at?

21:20.713 --> 21:23.215
Oh, sweet-- that's
really nice camerawork.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.184
GIRL:
Oh, man.

21:25.251 --> 21:27.354
The coffee shop crash.
You recorded it.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.655
There's a lot of races
around there.

21:28.721 --> 21:29.622
I just got lucky,
that's all.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.023
Oh, would you
call it luck?

21:31.090 --> 21:33.526
When one man lay dying and
another seven were injured--

21:33.593 --> 21:36.829
and instead of calling
911, you filmed it?

21:41.434 --> 21:43.302
(car tires screeching)

21:43.370 --> 21:46.238
(glass shattering)

21:46.305 --> 21:47.874
GIRL:
Oh, my God!

21:49.642 --> 21:50.943
Whoa, whoa, where
were you going?

21:55.014 --> 21:57.049
That's Kyle Clippard.

21:57.116 --> 21:58.385
He was in the trunk.

21:58.451 --> 21:59.552
Charlie's right

21:59.619 --> 22:01.921
about there being a second
person in that car.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.991
But that kid
is no 260 pounds.

22:06.893 --> 22:10.930
And that our driver
wasn't our real driver.

22:12.365 --> 22:14.401
All right,
so who's this guy?

22:18.004 --> 22:20.239
Do you really believe
no one saw the real driver?

22:20.306 --> 22:22.442
He took off at the
height of the chaos.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.110
And everybody was in
a state of shock.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.112
How you doing, Matt?
Almost there.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.279
It's a good thing

22:27.346 --> 22:29.849
I keep Amita's image enhancement
algorithms on hand.

22:29.916 --> 22:32.852
COLBY: So I figured out why
Clippard was in the trunk.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.821
It's a street racing
hazing ritual

22:34.887 --> 22:36.656
called "trunking,"
where they make the new guy

22:36.723 --> 22:38.758
ride in the trunk before
he can sit up front.

22:38.825 --> 22:40.092
Now, why would they do that?

22:40.159 --> 22:43.062
I guess it's tougher to clean
the vomit off the front seat.

22:43.129 --> 22:43.930
MATT:
Tasty.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.732
All right, here we go,

22:45.798 --> 22:47.366
it's a pretty good look
at the guy.

22:47.434 --> 22:48.768
MEGAN:
So this is the real driver.

22:48.835 --> 22:52.972
Now we have to hope that
somebody recognizes him.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.841
I do.
It's Frank Fisher--

22:54.907 --> 22:57.209
the guy that sold
the Ultralock to Kyle Clippard.

22:57.276 --> 22:59.078
And we still have him
in custody?

22:59.145 --> 23:00.079
Released him this morning.

23:04.283 --> 23:05.284
(engine revving)

23:05.351 --> 23:07.086
(tires screeching)

23:07.153 --> 23:10.289
This is really starting
to frost my shorts.

23:10.356 --> 23:12.091
The Scandinavian flick
didn't work.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.326
Ray, I take it that's
a racing term,

23:14.393 --> 23:16.128
and not what it
sounds like.

23:16.195 --> 23:18.698
Yeah, it's another name
for the inertia drift maneuver.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.900
A driver comes
into a curve,

23:20.967 --> 23:23.102
turns out of it,
then he whips back in,

23:23.169 --> 23:24.103
using the
centripetal force

23:24.170 --> 23:25.538
on the back half
of his car

23:25.605 --> 23:27.974
to slide it out
and drift.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.376
We know there was another person
in that car.

23:30.443 --> 23:31.544
Frank Fisher.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.846
But he weighs 140, not 260.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.347
And our math model
is telling us

23:35.414 --> 23:37.717
that there's 120 pounds
unaccounted for here.

23:37.784 --> 23:39.185
I know, and
that's significant.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.754
120 pounds I can't account for.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.957
Maybe it wasn't dead weight.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.426
If this was a race,

23:47.494 --> 23:49.261
and there was a second car--

23:49.328 --> 23:51.731
You're talking
about a collision.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.867
The extra force came not
from weight in the car...

23:54.934 --> 23:57.570
but from the briefest contact
between two vehicles.

23:57.637 --> 23:58.971
Hi, Charlie. Ray.
Hey.

23:59.038 --> 24:01.173
Hi. -So, uh, how's the analysis
going?

24:01.240 --> 24:03.610
It's going good-- we got racing,
we got we got drifting...

24:03.676 --> 24:04.844
Maybe some demolition derby.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.546
Hope you don't mind my watching.
I'm very fascinated

24:06.613 --> 24:08.515
with this stuff.
It is fascinating.

24:08.581 --> 24:09.782
Been a long time since

24:09.849 --> 24:11.317
I took engineering
in, uh, college,

24:11.383 --> 24:13.152
and, uh, I think I lost a lot.

24:13.219 --> 24:14.487
Thousands of years ago,

24:14.554 --> 24:16.322
we started with rocks,
sticks and bones.

24:16.388 --> 24:20.793
Now we got computer chips,
spacecraft, nuclear fusion.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.662
It's not just human nature
to understand the world,

24:22.729 --> 24:23.830
but also to interact with it.

24:23.896 --> 24:24.964
You see, that's why
we build machines.

24:25.031 --> 24:26.899
Because that's the way
we interact with the world.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.068
I mean that's our, uh,
that's the way we play.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.336
(quiet laugh)

24:30.402 --> 24:32.304
I'm starting a seminar next week

24:32.371 --> 24:34.507
on current challenges
in mechanical engineering.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.075
You should come sit in.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.409
No, no.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.011
I think I'm a little old
for college.

24:39.078 --> 24:41.180
GALUSKI: I was a mechanic before
I started.

24:41.247 --> 24:42.849
I started--
I was 30.

24:42.915 --> 24:46.352
But, hey, where wouldn't you be
older than most other people?

24:46.418 --> 24:47.353
A rest home?

24:47.419 --> 24:49.689
Uh, Ray-Ray, hey,

24:49.756 --> 24:52.391
so, just get
back to, uh...

24:52.458 --> 24:54.594
Wait a minute.

24:56.228 --> 24:57.697
Fisher is gone.

24:57.764 --> 25:00.399
Along with a new street car
he doesn't own.

25:00.466 --> 25:01.834
Damn it.
He knew we were coming back.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.536
I'll put it out to the police.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.538
Thanks.

25:05.605 --> 25:08.107
Kyle Clippard woke up.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.311
I just wanted
to ride along.

25:12.378 --> 25:14.146
See what it's like.

25:14.213 --> 25:15.582
But, Kyle, why?

25:15.648 --> 25:17.083
Looked like fun.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.586
Frank said to get
in the trunk.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.220
It was a race?

25:21.287 --> 25:23.222
Yeah, with some guy Frank knew.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.791
I-I think he called him Ernie.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.826
Ernie Fuller, right.

25:26.893 --> 25:28.494
And what caused
the accident?

25:28.561 --> 25:29.829
No idea.

25:29.896 --> 25:32.198
Last thing I remember
was being in the trunk

25:32.264 --> 25:34.967
and wishing I wasn't.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.269
Kyle, somebody hurt you
after the accident--

25:37.336 --> 25:38.838
do you have
any idea who?

25:38.905 --> 25:41.340
What?!

25:41.407 --> 25:43.542
Isn't this from the crash?

25:45.277 --> 25:47.980
Somebody tried to kill you.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.751
Why?

25:51.818 --> 25:54.854
I-I wasn't even driving.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.934
You looking into
the hit-and-run?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.536
Yeah, the Kaufmans,
the couple that died.

26:10.603 --> 26:12.939
They have no living
relatives.

26:13.005 --> 26:16.108
Nobody to push the case
once it went cold.

26:16.175 --> 26:18.110
Yeah.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.948
You know, David, when I was
out on that freighter,

26:22.014 --> 26:23.983
I kept thinking if
I die out here,

26:24.050 --> 26:25.985
a lot of questions
go unanswered.

26:26.052 --> 26:29.021
My story never
gets told.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.457
I'd just really like to find
these people an answer.

26:31.523 --> 26:33.793
What about Frank Fisher?

26:33.860 --> 26:36.462
Maybe that grill came off
a car he used to own?

26:36.528 --> 26:38.965
Yeah, only he's got an alibi.

26:39.031 --> 26:41.433
When they were killed,
Fisher was out in Pomona,

26:41.500 --> 26:42.902
winning a NHRA-approved race.

26:42.969 --> 26:45.604
We gotta find out
where that grill came from.

26:45.672 --> 26:46.773
Yeah, there's
something else, too.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.675
At the cemetery where
they're buried,

26:48.741 --> 26:51.077
somebody puts flowers
on their grave

26:51.143 --> 26:55.047
on the anniversary
of the accident.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.049
That's somebody
with a guilty conscience.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.752
And another thing:
Shortly after they died,

26:59.819 --> 27:02.588
somebody made an anonymous
donation to their church

27:02.655 --> 27:05.157
in the amount of $7,000 cash.

27:08.194 --> 27:10.496
* Shorty, what you gonna do?

27:10.562 --> 27:12.364
(engine revving)

27:12.431 --> 27:13.866
* Are you gonna get in?

27:13.933 --> 27:17.169
* Are you gonna ride...

27:17.236 --> 27:19.638
* Baby?

27:19.706 --> 27:20.973
* Baby, what you gonna do?

27:21.040 --> 27:22.742
* Yeah, what you gonna do? *

27:22.809 --> 27:24.310
* Are you gonna get out?

27:24.376 --> 27:25.277
You can't drift

27:25.344 --> 27:26.779
without gas,
Ernie!

27:26.846 --> 27:30.082
(overlapping chatter)

27:30.149 --> 27:33.753
Fisher's over on the right
talking with Ernie Fuller.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.087
Okay. Bring it on, guys.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.756
We're going in.
we're going in.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.257
FISHER:
Get out of my car!

27:38.324 --> 27:39.358
Damn, man!
I'm sorry.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.060
I'm--
Listen to me!

27:42.361 --> 27:44.396
(siren whooping)

27:44.463 --> 27:46.232
DAVID:
FBI!

27:46.298 --> 27:47.266
FBI! Don't move!

27:47.333 --> 27:47.934
FBI!

27:48.000 --> 27:48.935
I got the driver!

27:49.001 --> 27:50.269
I got the driver!

27:50.336 --> 27:51.237
AGENT:
Get back here!

27:51.303 --> 27:53.906
(car tires squealing)

28:00.847 --> 28:02.381
(tires screeching)

28:20.867 --> 28:22.969
(Don grunts)

28:26.773 --> 28:28.074
(siren wailing)

28:44.390 --> 28:45.357
(engine revving)

28:45.424 --> 28:47.493
CHARLIE: So the second car hits
the crash car

28:47.559 --> 28:49.728
and causes it to
lose control.

28:49.796 --> 28:51.563
It's called a
PIT maneuver.

28:51.630 --> 28:53.132
I know, I-I've seen it
on TV.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.367
Police cars do it
to fleeing vehicles

28:55.434 --> 28:57.036
during high-speed chases.

28:57.103 --> 28:58.737
You watch police
chases on TV?

28:58.805 --> 29:00.206
Hell, yeah. You don't?

29:00.272 --> 29:02.208
Download them
off the Net.

29:02.274 --> 29:04.210
All variables
accounted for--

29:04.276 --> 29:07.213
the end result
matches the sample.

29:07.279 --> 29:10.682
And that is geek
speak for "bingo."

29:10.749 --> 29:12.284
Ernie, everybody
we talk to

29:12.351 --> 29:13.953
says you and Frank race
all the time.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.054
You were racing him
the night

29:15.121 --> 29:16.122
of the coffee shop crash,
weren't you?

29:16.188 --> 29:17.623
You don't know that.
No?

29:17.689 --> 29:20.192
No, Frank didn't tell you,
and nobody else saw me there.

29:20.259 --> 29:21.293
Nice one, Ernie.

29:23.729 --> 29:25.497
I want you to look
at something.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.972
What is that?
I mean, how'd you get that?

29:35.541 --> 29:36.208
Who filmed that?
Is that film?

29:36.275 --> 29:37.977
Doesn't matter.
That's what happened.

29:38.044 --> 29:41.180
Frank's car killed a man,
but you caused it.

29:42.849 --> 29:44.016
It was an accident.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.617
I wasn't trying to hit Frank.

29:45.684 --> 29:47.686
He's my friend;
I helped him build that car.

29:47.753 --> 29:49.188
Where is Frank now?

29:49.255 --> 29:50.456
I have no idea.

29:57.496 --> 29:59.331
Hey, Larry!

29:59.398 --> 30:00.366
A little time off

30:00.432 --> 30:01.367
from the monastery?

30:01.433 --> 30:02.835
Uh, actually,
I'm letting the monks

30:02.902 --> 30:05.004
take a little break from me.

30:05.071 --> 30:06.372
How are your own meditations
coming along?

30:06.438 --> 30:08.307
It's hard to say.

30:08.374 --> 30:09.608
You know,
work keeps getting in the way.

30:09.675 --> 30:12.211
You know, actually,
my own state of quiescence

30:12.278 --> 30:15.514
has been disturbed
by this rather indelible image.

30:15.581 --> 30:19.251
A boot print to be more precise.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.186
From the Clippard
beating.

30:20.252 --> 30:22.154
Yeah, Charlie described told me
about the case.

30:22.221 --> 30:24.223
These would be the photos
of the tread marks

30:24.290 --> 30:26.192
on the young man's face?
Only have a partial.

30:26.258 --> 30:28.227
It's kind of hard to get a
good match on the boot print.

30:28.294 --> 30:30.296
Ah, well, enter
Fleinhardt.

30:30.362 --> 30:32.331
Have you, by any chance,
heard of

30:32.398 --> 30:34.533
a study from the University
of Sheffield, in England?

30:34.600 --> 30:36.168
Now they're using
mathematical techniques

30:36.235 --> 30:39.405
to extrapolate
full boot and shoe prints

30:39.471 --> 30:40.372
from partial samples.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.174
(phone rings)
Larry, that'd be great, man.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.511
There'll always be an England.
Sinclair.

30:45.577 --> 30:46.445
Okay, thanks.

30:46.512 --> 30:47.413
(sighs)

30:48.614 --> 30:50.382
They just found Frank Fisher.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.288
(door opens)

30:56.355 --> 30:59.491
Hey, do you have a minute to,
uh, take a look at something?

30:59.558 --> 31:01.827
Secret spy stuff?

31:01.894 --> 31:03.462
I'm kidding.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.497
What is it? -Well, I'm trying to
track down the grill

31:05.564 --> 31:06.933
on the car from
the cold case hit-and-run

31:06.999 --> 31:08.567
'cause the same grill
was on the car

31:08.634 --> 31:11.337
that Frank Fisher was driving
when it hit the coffee shop.

31:11.403 --> 31:13.172
And that's got to be more
than a coincidence, right?

31:13.239 --> 31:14.306
Well, yeah, I mean,

31:14.373 --> 31:15.707
you know, it's possible
that Fisher could have

31:15.774 --> 31:17.143
just found the
grill at a junkyard,

31:17.209 --> 31:18.644
but, yeah, I'm hoping
that there's more to it,

31:18.710 --> 31:20.279
although...

31:20.346 --> 31:23.215
I know you really don't put much
stock in hope, do you? -Colby,

31:23.282 --> 31:25.017
there have been math problems
I've worked on

31:25.084 --> 31:26.652
that have gone unsolved
for hundreds of years,

31:26.718 --> 31:28.454
so believe me, man,
I'm all about hope.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.689
All right, well, good,
because I keep thinking

31:30.756 --> 31:33.192
that there are things
the cold case can tell us

31:33.259 --> 31:34.360
about the recent crash,

31:34.426 --> 31:36.228
and the recent crash might
help us solve the cold case.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.230
Yeah, so like
a unifying theory.

31:38.297 --> 31:39.932
No, I think
that's worth testing.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.100
Well, here's what
I have so far--

31:41.167 --> 31:42.268
a list of cars that
were on the road

31:42.334 --> 31:43.936
three years ago with that grill

31:44.003 --> 31:45.737
and then a list
of known street racers.

31:45.804 --> 31:46.872
You're checking for a match.

31:46.939 --> 31:48.240
Right, basic
cop stuff.

31:48.307 --> 31:50.309
But what I was wondering
is if there might be

31:50.376 --> 31:52.211
some other kind of search
you might recommend.

31:52.278 --> 31:53.379
You know,
just a bigger one.

31:53.445 --> 31:55.047
Just throw in more data.
You never know

31:55.114 --> 31:56.615
where you're going
to find connectivity,

31:56.682 --> 31:58.117
so think of anything you can--

31:58.184 --> 31:59.986
not just the cars
and their owners but people

32:00.052 --> 32:01.220
from both incidents

32:01.287 --> 32:02.288
who don't seem
directly involved.

32:02.354 --> 32:05.124
Then friends and family
and witnesses and...

32:07.026 --> 32:09.395
Fisher was found
by a maintenance man,

32:09.461 --> 32:12.164
kicked in the head,
same as Kyle Clippard.

32:12.231 --> 32:14.166
Yeah, it happened
fairly recently.

32:14.233 --> 32:17.069
Even looks
like the same boot print.

32:17.136 --> 32:19.438
Fisher didn't have
any defensive wounds,

32:19.505 --> 32:21.840
so it's got to be
someone he knew, right?

32:21.907 --> 32:23.275
I'll spring the news
on Ernie Fuller,

32:23.342 --> 32:25.044
see if he has any idea where
Fisher might have been.

32:25.111 --> 32:26.445
Uh-huh. Hey, David,
what have you got?

32:26.512 --> 32:27.679
Larry's getting an image
of the boot print

32:27.746 --> 32:28.680
from both crime scenes,

32:28.747 --> 32:30.482
and I'm questioning
those crash witnesses again,

32:30.549 --> 32:32.118
using what we learned
from the video.

32:32.184 --> 32:33.252
How about you, Colby?

32:33.319 --> 32:34.553
Just running links
between the cold case

32:34.620 --> 32:36.822
and the Fisher crash.
-All right. Good.

32:36.888 --> 32:39.391
This could all be a
random coincidence, but...

32:39.458 --> 32:42.428
No, these deaths
are related somehow.

32:42.494 --> 32:45.297
Hold it lightly, like a bird,

32:45.364 --> 32:47.433
then just let it fly
straight to the nest.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.669
Now, you see?

32:50.736 --> 32:51.470
Unfortunately,

32:51.537 --> 32:53.539
my bird keeps attempting
to nest in the hallway.

32:53.605 --> 32:56.042
Fleinhardt, I hear you got
a sweet little ride.

32:56.108 --> 32:58.910
Yeah, a 1931
Ford Roadster.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.079
Nice.

33:00.146 --> 33:01.780
You got to bring it around.
Yeah, well,

33:01.847 --> 33:02.981
maybe in time.

33:03.049 --> 33:04.450
Only three runs
in the computer lab,

33:04.516 --> 33:06.118
and we got
a sufficient abrogated score.

33:06.185 --> 33:07.286
Well, it's a lot easier

33:07.353 --> 33:08.554
to extrapolate on
these partial boot prints,

33:08.620 --> 33:10.189
now that we've got
a second sample.

33:10.256 --> 33:13.425
Too bad a second person
had to die for us to get it.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.561
Gentlemen,
we have the results.

33:17.663 --> 33:20.066
Diet?

33:20.932 --> 33:22.534
Oh, come... that's...

33:22.601 --> 33:25.704
You know, Frank knew
a lot of people.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.339
I got no idea
where he's hanging out.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.141
Yeah, how about
his car?

33:29.208 --> 33:30.209
He had a custom grill
on there.

33:30.276 --> 33:31.510
You know
where he got it?

33:31.577 --> 33:33.945
No, his grill-- he could
have picked that up anywhere.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.414
Okay, you have to ask him

33:35.481 --> 33:37.216
and if you can't find him,
that's not my problem.

33:37.283 --> 33:38.584
Oh, we found him.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.920
Frank's dead.

33:41.987 --> 33:43.622
What? He crashed?

33:43.689 --> 33:45.224
Somebody beat him to death.

33:47.526 --> 33:50.596
Special Agent
David Sinclair-- FBI.

33:50.662 --> 33:53.065
I want to ask you
a few more questions.

33:54.333 --> 33:56.168
You know, Ernie,
the guy that killed Frank

33:56.235 --> 33:59.638
also beat a teenager
at the crash site.

33:59.705 --> 34:02.674
Did Frank know somebody
at that coffee shop?

34:02.741 --> 34:03.675
Uh, maybe, yeah.

34:03.742 --> 34:05.477
It was his idea to race,

34:05.544 --> 34:08.447
and he always liked to just
race by people he knew.

34:08.514 --> 34:10.749
Like who?
Mostly hot chicks.

34:10.816 --> 34:11.717
And, um,

34:11.783 --> 34:15.887
this dude he knew, who was
like an old friend of his.

34:15.954 --> 34:17.323
We have a video
of the incident

34:17.389 --> 34:18.357
that shows you
30 seconds

34:18.424 --> 34:20.559
after the crash,
walking toward the car.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.561
What happened
when you got there?

34:22.628 --> 34:24.496
I went over to...
look at the driver,

34:24.563 --> 34:25.731
but I didn't touch him.

34:25.797 --> 34:27.666
Somebody did.

34:27.733 --> 34:28.700
Tell me who it was.

34:28.767 --> 34:30.536
(sighs)

34:36.475 --> 34:38.310
Okay, if I adjust
the translational

34:38.377 --> 34:39.878
and rotational invariance...

34:39.945 --> 34:41.547
CHARLIE: And then generate an
edge direction histogram...

34:41.613 --> 34:44.716
And that, my young
friends, is a boot.

34:44.783 --> 34:47.253
That measures out
to a size 12.

34:47.319 --> 34:48.554
That's one big dude.

34:48.620 --> 34:51.223
The dude used
to race a lot,

34:51.290 --> 34:54.393
but then he quit and he
said Frank should stop, too,

34:54.460 --> 34:56.628
but, for some reason,
it really pissed Frank off.

34:56.695 --> 34:58.029
(laughing):
Frank would just...

34:58.096 --> 35:00.766
he would just, like, go blowing
by him and yell stuff.

35:00.832 --> 35:02.334
Sam was dead.

35:02.401 --> 35:03.902
We were all angry.

35:03.969 --> 35:05.337
It could have been any of us.

35:05.404 --> 35:06.372
But it was one guy.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.307
You give me a name,
or I will arrest you

35:08.374 --> 35:10.709
right here
for obstruction.

35:12.178 --> 35:14.180
This is so weird.

35:14.246 --> 35:16.515
Hey, Megan.
Yeah?

35:16.582 --> 35:20.186
The grill from the cold case,
it was for a 1994 Honda Civic.

35:20.252 --> 35:21.253
And check this out.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.888
I just found
a known street racer

35:22.954 --> 35:25.056
who owned
that identical car,

35:25.123 --> 35:26.625
who was present
at the coffee shop crash,

35:26.692 --> 35:28.360
but he wasn't
one of the drivers.

35:28.427 --> 35:29.595
Ernie just
gave me a name.

35:29.661 --> 35:31.297
How much you want to
bet it's the same guy?

35:31.363 --> 35:33.765
(phone rings)

35:33.832 --> 35:36.268
Megan, I know.
I'm right here.

35:37.903 --> 35:39.638
Hey, the guy

35:39.705 --> 35:41.473
who usually works this route--
where is he?

35:51.683 --> 35:54.820
Apparently, he comes here
every day.

36:00.326 --> 36:04.730
Robert Lowell,
do you know why we're here?

36:04.796 --> 36:07.399
Yes, I know.

36:07.466 --> 36:09.401
BOBBY:
Three years ago,

36:09.468 --> 36:13.805
I was racing around
the Silver Lake Reservoir.

36:13.872 --> 36:14.773
I hit two people.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.743
And I killed them.

36:17.809 --> 36:20.579
Every night I go to sleep,
I see their faces,

36:20.646 --> 36:23.949
how they looked at me
right before the car hit them.

36:25.451 --> 36:27.686
I took my car apart,
and I sold the pieces.

36:27.753 --> 36:28.920
Right.
The grill to Fisher.

36:28.987 --> 36:30.656
The money I got
from the parts--

36:30.722 --> 36:32.591
I sent it all to the church
those people belonged to.

36:32.658 --> 36:36.662
You put
the flowers on the graves.

36:36.728 --> 36:38.630
Why don't you tell us what
happened at that coffee house?

36:40.366 --> 36:41.933
(tires screeching)

36:43.001 --> 36:44.770
People were running everywhere.

36:47.939 --> 36:48.907
It was terrible.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.844
I was just looking
to see who was hurt.

36:55.113 --> 36:56.882
I saw the kid near the car.

36:58.884 --> 37:01.520
I was sure
that he was the driver,

37:01.587 --> 37:03.922
that he had done this...

37:03.989 --> 37:05.691
and I just exploded.

37:06.958 --> 37:08.294
MEGAN:
But the kid

37:08.360 --> 37:09.895
wasn't the driver.

37:09.961 --> 37:12.831
Frank was.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.132
He told me yesterday.

37:14.199 --> 37:17.536
I realized I nearly killed
the wrong guy.

37:17.603 --> 37:20.539
And then Frank tells me...

37:20.606 --> 37:23.275
he was racing around the corner
because of me.

37:23.342 --> 37:26.144
I felt like I was
in a daze.

37:26.211 --> 37:28.714
Then I hit him and he went down.

37:28.780 --> 37:31.016
And I just kept
kicking him.

37:33.018 --> 37:35.487
This has got to stop.

37:39.691 --> 37:43.329
I'll, uh, request
a suicide watch.

37:51.503 --> 37:53.472
Hey, Don.
Hey, buddy.

37:53.539 --> 37:54.573
Want some coffee?

37:54.640 --> 37:55.907
Yeah, that'd be great, thanks.

37:57.876 --> 38:01.046
Just want to let you know
that I turned down the DC job.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.048
Oh, yeah?

38:03.114 --> 38:04.850
That's what you wanted, huh?

38:04.916 --> 38:06.818
I mean, what I want is

38:06.885 --> 38:08.954
to stay here
and work with you guys--

38:09.020 --> 38:10.856
people I know.

38:10.922 --> 38:13.024
But I know that decision's
not entirely up to me, so...

38:17.929 --> 38:19.498
All right.

38:21.099 --> 38:22.601
I'll check into it.

38:53.131 --> 38:55.066
*

39:01.907 --> 39:04.209
CHARLIE: I mean, my advice to
you has always been

39:04.275 --> 39:05.511
never to concentrate
on coincidences.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.446
But for once,
at least in this case,

39:07.513 --> 39:08.947
everything was connected.

39:09.014 --> 39:11.983
Yeah, but, uh, the root cause
was meaningless, huh?

39:12.050 --> 39:14.352
(chuckles)
Yeah, reckless driving.

39:14.420 --> 39:16.622
That's crazy.

39:16.688 --> 39:18.790
So, what, are you writing that
book? -Yeah.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.358
The work is pretty
much almost done.

39:20.426 --> 39:21.927
I just have to
write the preface

39:21.993 --> 39:24.630
and simplify some of
the math passages.

39:24.696 --> 39:27.499
Is that Dad?
Yeah.

39:27.566 --> 39:28.834
Did you invite him down here?
-Hello, boys.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.570
Boys, meet CalSci's
newest student.

39:31.637 --> 39:34.005
What do you mean?
You're taking a class?

39:34.072 --> 39:35.073
No, I was just auditing.

39:35.140 --> 39:37.342
GALUSKI: Alan just got through
his first day

39:37.409 --> 39:39.811
of Elements of Mechanical
Engineering. -Yeah.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.046
Wait a second,
you're telling me that

39:41.112 --> 39:42.814
I've spent years trying
to get you interested

39:42.881 --> 39:46.452
in advanced mathematics and now,
suddenly, you're taking a class?

39:46.518 --> 39:47.986
It depends on who teaches it.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.388
DON:
Oh, psych! Ooh, that's low.

39:50.456 --> 39:52.758
That's cold. GALUSKI: It's got
nothing to do with me.

39:52.824 --> 39:54.092
What would most
people rather do?

39:54.159 --> 39:55.494
Solve the Riemann Hypothesis

39:55.561 --> 39:57.763
or build lasers
and robots?

39:57.829 --> 39:59.965
DON & ALAN: Lasers and robots.
-Of course.

40:00.031 --> 40:01.533
Algebraic geometry,
ergodic theory,

40:01.600 --> 40:03.034
automorphic forms--
the list goes on and on.

40:03.101 --> 40:05.103
You people have no idea what
you're missing out on.

40:05.170 --> 40:06.772
Yeah, and we'd like
to keep it that way, Charlie.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.907
So what, you're getting
a degree or something?

40:08.974 --> 40:10.241
Well, actually...

40:10.308 --> 40:12.644
I'm just having fun.
