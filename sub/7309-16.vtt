WEBVTT

00:03.511 --> 00:04.511
How much?

00:04.572 --> 00:06.749
Don't know. Come on, take a guess.

00:06.803 --> 00:08.109
I don't know.

00:09.260 --> 00:11.173
Then we're just going to have
to settle this with facts.

00:11.197 --> 00:12.808
I am Googling "men's jacket."

00:13.009 --> 00:14.236
What would you say it was made of?

00:14.260 --> 00:15.785
- It felt like butter.
- Lambskin.

00:15.837 --> 00:17.111
Who's the designer?

00:17.135 --> 00:19.246
- Why do you assume I know?
- Because.

00:19.384 --> 00:20.678
Because? Because I'm a woman?

00:20.702 --> 00:21.757
Because I'm Jewish?

00:22.008 --> 00:23.676
Because you're a great detective.

00:23.700 --> 00:24.700
True.

00:24.760 --> 00:27.704
McGee flashed the label
when he showed us his lining.

00:27.885 --> 00:28.885
Armani.

00:29.134 --> 00:30.134
Anything else?

00:30.323 --> 00:31.489
Lizard-embossed trim,

00:32.261 --> 00:34.316
a two-way zipper, and a chest pocket.

00:36.012 --> 00:37.678
Found it. It's from the Armani

00:37.900 --> 00:38.957
2007 Resort Collection.

00:38.992 --> 00:40.961
- You can purchase it for...
- $2,000.

00:41.073 --> 00:42.961
They say the clothes make the man.

00:43.635 --> 00:45.424
Yeah, he's not a man, he's a McGee.

00:45.448 --> 00:46.781
Either way, where is he?

00:48.197 --> 00:50.246
Over there, overdressed.

00:54.386 --> 00:55.386
You okay?

00:57.151 --> 00:58.151
Yeah.

00:58.654 --> 01:01.431
I, um, I just need to talk
to Special Agent Gibbs.

01:02.526 --> 01:05.052
Hey, your, uh, jacket's really soft.

01:05.340 --> 01:06.340
Thanks.

01:06.840 --> 01:08.027
Who is McGee escorting?

01:08.051 --> 01:10.002
I don't know; Never seen him before.

01:10.026 --> 01:11.581
This is Special Agent Gibbs.

01:12.151 --> 01:13.484
Lieutenant Sanders, sir.

01:13.901 --> 01:15.845
I need you to investigate a murder.

01:16.901 --> 01:17.901
Whose?

01:23.908 --> 01:25.026
Mine.

02:14.615 --> 02:15.670
This is killing me.

02:15.740 --> 02:17.017
I feel like I know him.

02:17.495 --> 02:18.495
Mossad?

02:18.615 --> 02:19.615
Maybe.

02:19.740 --> 02:20.740
Internet dating?

02:21.114 --> 02:24.169
I will kill you 18 different
ways with this paper clip.

02:25.005 --> 02:27.232
Ducky figure out what's wrong
with Lieutenant Sanders, boss?

02:27.256 --> 02:28.608
No, he's still examing him.

02:28.632 --> 02:30.293
Thinks it could be radiation poisoning.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.858
Do we know how he was exposed?

02:31.882 --> 02:33.659
No, but he's got a high-risk job

02:33.819 --> 02:35.430
as an inspector for the IAEA.

02:35.570 --> 02:37.514
International Atomic Energy Agency.

02:38.943 --> 02:40.720
I wonder if he's been to Israel.

02:42.319 --> 02:44.171
I feel like I know him from somewhere.

02:44.195 --> 02:45.639
DiNozzo, check his travel.

02:45.882 --> 02:47.493
Is this guy contagious, boss?

02:47.569 --> 02:49.290
Well, for McGee better hope not.

02:50.444 --> 02:51.444
Underwear, too?

02:51.631 --> 02:53.297
Yes, McGee, I need everything.

02:53.630 --> 02:55.046
Don't you think that's kind of overkill?

02:55.070 --> 02:56.125
Get over it, McGee.

02:56.694 --> 02:58.138
I'm a scientist, remember?

02:58.319 --> 02:59.819
You said he coughed on you?

03:01.319 --> 03:02.319
Yes.

03:02.444 --> 03:03.444
So I need to check

03:03.819 --> 03:05.763
all of your clothing for radiation.

03:06.383 --> 03:07.605
If you were exposed...

03:08.821 --> 03:09.987
Yeah, I feel exposed.

03:12.383 --> 03:13.494
Where's your jacket?

03:14.444 --> 03:16.570
Come on, you need to test that, too?

03:16.656 --> 03:18.109
You said he grabbed your arm.

03:18.133 --> 03:19.734
Will you promise not to stain it?

03:19.758 --> 03:21.602
I promise not to stain it.

03:34.633 --> 03:35.633
Table's cold.

03:36.070 --> 03:38.403
None of my other
patients ever complained.

03:38.945 --> 03:41.157
Sorry, I thought it might be nice

03:41.201 --> 03:43.483
for you to have someone
to talk to for a change.

03:43.507 --> 03:45.229
Oh, I always talk to my guests.

03:45.695 --> 03:48.028
The difference here
is that you talk back.

03:48.134 --> 03:50.076
- Talk about what?
- Let's see.

03:50.100 --> 03:53.177
In your case, I'd talk
about your runner's physique,

03:53.221 --> 03:56.743
your well-toned calves,
your impressive thighs.

03:57.573 --> 04:00.350
It doesn't sound quite so
personal when you're dead.

04:00.885 --> 04:01.885
Mr. Palmer.

04:02.882 --> 04:06.104
Yes, I will label these and
get them over to radiobiology.

04:08.134 --> 04:09.578
When did the nausea start?

04:11.196 --> 04:12.173
Two days ago.

04:12.197 --> 04:15.277
Since I'd been traveling, I
blamed it on the local moqueca.

04:15.382 --> 04:17.382
Until your hair started falling out.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.444
Ah, Jethro.

04:19.500 --> 04:22.108
We have to wait for radiobiology

04:22.132 --> 04:24.576
to find out exactly
with what we're dealing.

04:24.742 --> 04:25.719
Containment?

04:25.743 --> 04:26.792
Minimal.

04:26.821 --> 04:28.361
Abby's preliminary findings show

04:28.385 --> 04:29.486
that they're alpha emissions

04:29.510 --> 04:32.172
which, unlike gamma rays
and X-rays, can be blocked

04:32.196 --> 04:34.640
by a simple layer of
dead cells on the skin.

04:34.885 --> 04:37.218
Just avoid contact
and exchange of fluids.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.868
- Is he fit to answer questions?
- I'm right here.

04:39.892 --> 04:41.681
I can hear you.

04:42.025 --> 04:43.747
I'm sorry; It's force of habit.

04:44.149 --> 04:45.813
You're around uranium in your job.

04:45.837 --> 04:47.876
What makes you think this
was murder and not accidental?

04:47.900 --> 04:49.276
The radiation badge.

04:49.344 --> 04:52.220
It's a thermoluminescent dosimeter.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.502
I wore it to inspect
the power plant in Brazil

04:54.526 --> 04:56.127
where we discovered violations.

04:56.151 --> 04:57.377
When I returned four days ago,

04:57.401 --> 04:59.456
the film from my badge was processed.

04:59.529 --> 05:00.584
And the glow curve?

05:00.837 --> 05:02.003
Detected no exposure.

05:02.142 --> 05:03.791
Said everything was fine.

05:04.839 --> 05:06.501
Were the Brazilians
aware of your findings?

05:06.525 --> 05:07.717
From my line of questioning,

05:07.766 --> 05:09.562
I'd say they knew they were busted.

05:09.586 --> 05:11.502
Brazil has a history of covert attempts

05:11.526 --> 05:14.081
to secure nuclear weaponry
with Germany's aid.

05:14.151 --> 05:16.039
Yeah, it's an unsavory partnership

05:16.214 --> 05:18.769
that goes back to the
fall of the Third Reich.

05:20.026 --> 05:21.301
I'll need access to your offices

05:21.325 --> 05:22.502
and your inspection team.

05:22.526 --> 05:24.877
I told transpo I want
to move him to AFRRI.

05:24.901 --> 05:26.127
That's the Armed Forc...

05:26.151 --> 05:28.642
Armed Forces Radiobiology
Research Institute.

05:28.666 --> 05:30.892
Although in my line of work,
we call it something else.

05:30.916 --> 05:31.916
What's that?

05:33.607 --> 05:34.607
The last exit.

05:37.292 --> 05:38.768
Okay, ready? Look away now.

05:38.792 --> 05:40.079
Look at me, close your eyes.

05:40.103 --> 05:41.256
Now look back really fast.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.605
Open them up. Anything?

05:43.166 --> 05:44.237
N - No, still nothing.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.009
Okay, squat down.

05:46.044 --> 05:49.035
Squat down, close your eyes,
and then jump up and look.

05:50.855 --> 05:52.541
Ziva, you find out how you know

05:52.584 --> 05:53.954
- the lieutenant?
- Not yet.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.081
He's been to Israel
twice in the past decade.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.270
We've never been in the same city.

05:57.294 --> 05:59.646
He's also been to Iran,
Bulgaria, Pakistan, Kuwait,

05:59.670 --> 06:01.281
Croatia, Korea, and Slovenia.

06:01.544 --> 06:03.488
- Guy gets around.
- I left out Canada.

06:03.855 --> 06:05.648
Ducky's transferring
him to AFRRI in Bethesda.

06:05.672 --> 06:07.541
- Ziva, go with him.
- Protection detail?

06:07.793 --> 06:08.793
Not sure yet.

06:09.491 --> 06:11.460
On it. Tacing his phone
calls, bank accounts,

06:11.484 --> 06:12.958
everyone he's ever
met in his entire life.

06:12.982 --> 06:14.980
Leave that to McGee. You're with me.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.206
Uh, McGee's not here.

06:16.230 --> 06:17.563
Where the hell is McGee?

06:18.917 --> 06:21.068
Abby is testing my
clothes for radiation,

06:21.110 --> 06:23.144
and it is taking longer
than we thought, so...

06:23.168 --> 06:24.890
Pick up where DiNozzo left off.

06:25.043 --> 06:26.043
Got it, boss.

06:26.918 --> 06:29.084
If clothes make the man,
what does that make McGee?

06:29.108 --> 06:30.108
Male nurse?

06:30.293 --> 06:32.229
No. Aqua Smurf.

06:35.042 --> 06:37.455
I've e-mailed your records
to the doctors at AFRRI.

06:37.479 --> 06:38.707
They'll be running more tests.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.286
Try to conserve your energy.

06:41.045 --> 06:42.211
You'll need it later.

06:43.480 --> 06:46.035
I don't want to see you
back on my cold table.

06:46.419 --> 06:47.974
I appreciate your help, Doc.

06:48.169 --> 06:49.169
Good luck.

06:57.544 --> 06:58.766
Forget something, Doc?

06:59.731 --> 07:01.644
Special Agent Gibbs
asked me to accompany you.

07:01.668 --> 07:02.668
I'm Officer David.

07:03.293 --> 07:05.070
I'd, uh, shake your hand, but...

07:05.172 --> 07:08.449
Um, actually, it would be best
to avoid all bodily contact.

07:08.731 --> 07:10.564
You sound just like my prom date.

07:15.109 --> 07:16.775
Would you mind smiling for me?

07:18.293 --> 07:21.015
- Do I have something in my teeth?
- No.

07:21.421 --> 07:22.587
You can stop smiling.

07:27.544 --> 07:29.421
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

07:36.186 --> 07:37.408
Do we know each other?

07:39.625 --> 07:41.069
Where'd you go to college?

07:41.688 --> 07:42.688
Israel.

07:44.121 --> 07:45.662
Could we have met at a conference?

07:45.686 --> 07:46.686
Yes.

07:46.749 --> 07:48.415
Except I've never been to one.

07:49.561 --> 07:50.561
Burning Man, 2002.

07:50.872 --> 07:52.038
Extreme Twister Camp.

07:53.375 --> 07:55.263
I don't even know what that means.

07:59.998 --> 08:01.662
It took two hours, but I finally found

08:01.686 --> 08:04.574
three seats on a nonstop
Lufthansa flight to Gdansk.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.129
You leave next Thursday...

08:06.311 --> 08:09.311
Holly, I don't know even if
we'll be making this trip.

08:09.564 --> 08:12.287
I'll know more after I talk
to NCIS. Special Agent Gibbs.

08:12.311 --> 08:13.912
Okay, well, the sooner
the better because there's

08:13.936 --> 08:15.912
- cancellation fees...
- I understand, just leave the itinerary.

08:15.936 --> 08:16.913
I'm Mark Sadowski.

08:16.937 --> 08:18.000
We spoke on the phone.

08:18.061 --> 08:20.041
Diane, NCIS is here.

08:20.122 --> 08:22.233
Which one is Lieutenant Sanders' desk?

08:22.937 --> 08:23.937
It's clean.

08:24.372 --> 08:25.372
I can see that.

08:25.750 --> 08:27.923
He means they swept the office, DiNozzo.

08:27.967 --> 08:29.711
When Roy said he was
throwing up, we checked

08:29.755 --> 08:31.889
the radiation levels.
They're within normal limits.

08:32.462 --> 08:33.977
I'll gather his things.

08:34.561 --> 08:36.561
Hi. I'm Diane Russio.

08:37.248 --> 08:38.248
How's Roy?

08:38.498 --> 08:39.664
Transferred to AFRRI.

08:42.374 --> 08:44.707
We were hoping it was
just food poisoning.

08:44.749 --> 08:45.749
Radiation.

08:45.948 --> 08:47.163
Do you know where he was exposed?

08:47.187 --> 08:48.187
No, not yet.

08:48.325 --> 08:49.304
Well, it couldn't have been Brazil.

08:49.328 --> 08:50.381
We toured the facility together,

08:50.405 --> 08:52.381
and Diane and I aren't sick.

08:52.826 --> 08:55.048
Could someone have done this on purpose?

08:55.575 --> 08:57.116
I'll need your radiation badges.

08:57.140 --> 08:58.140
Of course.

08:59.014 --> 09:01.680
After hours in Brazil, did
all of you stick together?

09:01.952 --> 09:04.741
Uh, we stayed in the same
hotel, ate the same food.

09:04.765 --> 09:06.487
Roy would get up early and run.

09:06.889 --> 09:09.364
Oh, the night before we left, we
hit the local bars for a cerveza

09:09.388 --> 09:10.388
and a cigar.

09:10.453 --> 09:11.653
Roy left early.

09:12.142 --> 09:13.119
Alone?

09:13.143 --> 09:14.144
I was with him.

09:14.192 --> 09:15.891
We just went straight back to the hotel.

09:15.939 --> 09:17.139
I'm 30 years older

09:17.169 --> 09:18.285
than both of them and they're the ones

09:18.309 --> 09:20.368
who are too tired to party.

09:20.392 --> 09:21.557
I'll go get my badge.

09:22.328 --> 09:23.439
So can we visit Roy?

09:25.202 --> 09:26.813
Yeah, if he wants to see you.

09:33.762 --> 09:34.741
Answers, Abs.

09:34.765 --> 09:35.765
I got them, Gibbs.

09:36.516 --> 09:38.490
I took Lieutenant
Sanders' dosimeter apart,

09:38.514 --> 09:40.402
and I discovered that it is hinky.

09:40.640 --> 09:43.290
I- I might even
call it hinky-dory.

09:43.890 --> 09:46.056
Oh, come on, Gibbs, it's a little cute.

09:47.853 --> 09:48.867
Okay, um...

09:48.891 --> 09:50.446
if you follow this red beam,

09:50.891 --> 09:52.724
you can see there's no clear path

09:53.077 --> 09:56.299
between the photomultiplier
tubes and the crystal lattice.

09:58.514 --> 09:59.993
This little piece of plastic

10:00.017 --> 10:01.744
is blocking the light emissions.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.418
- Sabotage?
- Or...

10:03.517 --> 10:04.683
faulty manufacturing.

10:04.952 --> 10:07.055
I mean, it's a state-of-
the-art lifesaving device,

10:07.079 --> 10:09.496
but it's still made from
injection-molded plastic

10:09.520 --> 10:11.297
just like a, um, Happy Meal toy.

10:11.642 --> 10:12.996
And you know how sometimes
you get one of those

10:13.020 --> 10:14.555
and there'll be a little
blob of plastic on the leg

10:14.579 --> 10:16.053
and you have to bend
it back and forth...

10:16.077 --> 10:17.077
Abby.

10:18.015 --> 10:19.367
Somebody needs a Happy Meal.

10:19.391 --> 10:20.391
What about these?

10:20.452 --> 10:21.896
Um, these are operational.

10:22.392 --> 10:23.370
No globs.

10:23.394 --> 10:24.930
Their reading was a true positive.

10:24.954 --> 10:26.848
My conclusion is that
Sanders had a bad badge.

10:27.018 --> 10:28.244
There was no foul play.

10:28.268 --> 10:29.430
If he hadn't gotten sick,

10:29.454 --> 10:30.928
he wouldn't have even noticed.

10:30.952 --> 10:32.285
I need to talk to Ducky.

10:37.392 --> 10:38.392
Hey, Duck.

10:38.953 --> 10:41.787
Jethro, I was just about to call you.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.244
Lieutenant Sanders wasn't
poisoned at the power plant.

10:44.268 --> 10:47.003
I know. The radiobiology lab

10:47.578 --> 10:48.931
identified the isotope in his blood.

10:48.955 --> 10:50.761
It was thallium.

10:51.580 --> 10:52.968
Wow, that is nasty stuff.

10:53.703 --> 10:55.036
Isn't the nonradioactive

10:55.391 --> 10:57.224
form of that used for rat poison?

10:57.519 --> 10:58.519
Yes, it's lethal

10:58.840 --> 11:01.245
and extremely effective:
Colorless, odorless,

11:01.269 --> 11:04.207
tasteless, and soluble in water.

11:04.704 --> 11:06.261
Are you thinking ingestion?

11:06.305 --> 11:07.647
Most likely.

11:07.707 --> 11:10.768
And-and no longer than 72 hours ago.

11:10.955 --> 11:12.732
Okay, so now we know the "when."

11:13.330 --> 11:14.774
We just have to figure out

11:15.141 --> 11:18.732
why, how and who.

11:26.261 --> 11:28.401
The pigment, Prussian blue,

11:28.452 --> 11:29.744
has been applied by artists

11:29.768 --> 11:30.768
since the 1700s.

11:31.329 --> 11:32.931
Yeah, it was used by van Gogh,

11:32.955 --> 11:33.955
Monet, Picasso.

11:34.332 --> 11:35.332
Me.

11:35.643 --> 11:37.365
How long until it takes effect?

11:37.517 --> 11:38.517
About 24 hours.

11:39.206 --> 11:41.913
Prussian blue works best when it's used

11:41.954 --> 11:44.977
or taken as a preventative
measure before exposure.

11:45.342 --> 11:46.426
Or right after.

11:46.450 --> 11:48.800
But in the meantime, let's see
if you can replace the fluids

11:48.824 --> 11:50.849
you lost without an I. V.

11:50.909 --> 11:52.976
We prefer oral feeding to maintain

11:53.019 --> 11:54.579
the integrity of your gut.

11:55.198 --> 11:56.364
My gut has integrity.

11:56.886 --> 11:57.886
So does my spleen.

11:58.450 --> 11:59.802
Now, you can eat anything

11:59.826 --> 12:01.986
you want, just so long
as it's low-microbial.

12:02.010 --> 12:03.010
But no drinking,

12:03.090 --> 12:05.021
no smoking.

12:05.742 --> 12:06.739
Are we done?

12:06.763 --> 12:07.763
One more thing.

12:08.010 --> 12:09.987
We need to keep his stress levels down.

12:10.011 --> 12:12.233
We're in the middle
of an investigation...

12:14.954 --> 12:15.954
I have to go.

12:17.198 --> 12:19.142
Any place I can get some fresh air?

12:19.574 --> 12:21.629
This facility has an open-air garden.

12:25.987 --> 12:27.209
They catch it in time?

12:27.614 --> 12:28.614
Uh, unclear.

12:29.424 --> 12:31.478
The next 24 hours are key.

12:31.951 --> 12:34.243
I'm more interested in the past.

12:35.427 --> 12:36.927
I want a list of every sip,

12:37.489 --> 12:40.046
every bite, every kiss, every time

12:40.102 --> 12:42.157
he's hit the head in the past 72 hours.

12:43.616 --> 12:45.560
Do you think he's hiding something?

12:46.115 --> 12:47.448
Have you placed him yet?

12:48.928 --> 12:49.928
No.

12:50.491 --> 12:51.935
You place him first, Ziva.

12:53.740 --> 12:54.740
Trust later.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.592
There were only trace
amounts of radiation

13:04.616 --> 13:06.281
on your clothes, but I'm still

13:06.305 --> 13:07.416
glad we tested them.

13:07.616 --> 13:10.004
'Cause it's better to
be safe than glowing.

13:11.928 --> 13:12.928
Where's my jacket?

13:13.184 --> 13:14.184
It's here.

13:15.866 --> 13:16.866
It's really soft.

13:17.642 --> 13:18.682
If you rubbed that against

13:18.719 --> 13:20.531
- a certain part of your body...
- You didn't.

13:20.555 --> 13:22.110
I don't even have that part.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.906
Thank you for taking
good care of my jacket.

13:25.930 --> 13:26.930
You're welcome.

13:29.735 --> 13:31.178
What?

13:31.305 --> 13:33.249
I promised you I wouldn't stain it.

13:33.617 --> 13:35.728
Just put your hand over it, like this.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.450
It looks very natural. Thank you.

13:40.556 --> 13:42.030
So did you find anything in the stuff

13:42.054 --> 13:43.530
Tony took from the lieutenant's desk?

13:43.554 --> 13:44.554
Nothing yet.

13:44.679 --> 13:45.918
I'm checking all the protein bars

13:45.942 --> 13:47.443
for needle-puncture marks.

13:47.467 --> 13:49.731
Think the killer injected
them with thallium?

13:50.558 --> 13:51.613
That's what I'd do.

13:51.935 --> 13:53.037
It's pretty devious.

13:53.061 --> 13:55.894
Using something so healthy
to make someone so sick.

14:00.927 --> 14:03.864
So the rest of the pizza
is inside your refrigerator?

14:03.888 --> 14:06.365
Yeah. You can test it, but I, for one,

14:06.408 --> 14:08.756
trust Papa Don implicitly.

14:08.780 --> 14:09.780
Then what?

14:09.841 --> 14:10.818
I brushed my teeth.

14:10.842 --> 14:12.055
And then I went to bed.

14:12.403 --> 14:13.736
I was pretty jet-lagged,

14:13.902 --> 14:15.128
but I still got up to
run the next morning.

14:15.152 --> 14:16.152
What time?

14:16.264 --> 14:17.641
0530.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.943
I thought I was the only one who
got up that early to exercise.

14:20.967 --> 14:21.967
Nope.

14:22.467 --> 14:24.630
Had water from the
tap and an energy gel.

14:24.654 --> 14:25.654
Raspberry.

14:25.717 --> 14:26.717
Noted.

14:26.841 --> 14:28.754
Then I ran the two
miles from my apartement

14:28.778 --> 14:30.629
to the Custis Trail,
which runs along the...

14:30.653 --> 14:31.653
The Potomac.

14:32.029 --> 14:33.193
Right. Then I headed over the...

14:33.217 --> 14:34.883
The Arlington Memorial Bridge,

14:35.107 --> 14:37.834
where you passed a woman
wearing a yellow Windbreaker.

14:37.858 --> 14:39.191
Is she part of the plot?

14:39.233 --> 14:40.210
No, she's me!

14:40.234 --> 14:43.020
You're the one who wears the
fluorescent orange watch cap

14:43.044 --> 14:44.266
when you run, correct?

14:44.732 --> 14:46.398
Right, yeah, so the cars will notice me.

14:46.422 --> 14:48.211
People, too. I pass you every morning.

14:48.235 --> 14:50.123
I'm going east, you're going west.

14:50.170 --> 14:51.447
Don't you recognize me?

14:52.862 --> 14:54.473
I'm sorry, no. How about now?

14:54.670 --> 14:55.836
I mean, you've got to picture me

14:55.860 --> 14:57.915
sweating and panting and, you know...

14:58.858 --> 15:00.413
Yeah, of course, I know you.

15:00.811 --> 15:02.788
Yeah, you have a smooth
stride, great carriage.

15:02.812 --> 15:03.975
I often turn after you pass

15:03.999 --> 15:05.387
to admire your technique.

15:05.561 --> 15:07.005
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

15:07.247 --> 15:08.247
Yeah.

15:08.496 --> 15:10.607
You have a very cute, tight technique.

15:13.374 --> 15:15.207
How far did you run that morning?

15:18.172 --> 15:19.161
Eight miles.

15:19.185 --> 15:22.073
Went home, showered, and
headed to the field office.

15:22.439 --> 15:24.216
Ate two protein bars at my desk.

15:24.873 --> 15:25.873
Then at 1200,

15:26.311 --> 15:27.975
Mark and I headed to
Oakwood Shooting Range.

15:27.999 --> 15:29.934
- Where's that?
- Near Andrews.

15:30.624 --> 15:31.624
What do you shoot?

15:31.682 --> 15:32.663
Glock.

15:32.687 --> 15:33.853
That's a good choice.

15:34.313 --> 15:35.424
Mark and I ate lunch

15:35.812 --> 15:37.478
while we took target practice.

15:37.560 --> 15:39.671
I had a bacon cheeseburger with fries,

15:39.937 --> 15:41.714
washed down with a large coffee.

15:42.124 --> 15:45.301
You run like a health
nut and eat like a slob.

15:46.123 --> 15:47.734
I've always weighed the same.

15:48.255 --> 15:50.643
People told me at 40,
my body would change.

15:51.874 --> 15:54.374
I guess I might not
have to worry about that.

15:57.936 --> 15:59.102
Have you made a will?

15:59.624 --> 16:01.539
I'm sorry, that was too blunt. Uh..

16:01.563 --> 16:02.563
No, no, no.

16:03.061 --> 16:04.061
I like blunt.

16:06.888 --> 16:08.610
I was thinking your beneficiary

16:10.078 --> 16:11.744
would have a potential motive.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.291
The joke's on them, because I...

16:16.642 --> 16:17.753
I don't have a will.

16:22.264 --> 16:25.181
Mark Sadowski, senior member
of the team, is about to retire.

16:25.205 --> 16:26.593
You know what that means.

16:26.951 --> 16:27.951
He gets a watch?

16:28.015 --> 16:29.184
No, somebody's going to bump him off.

16:29.208 --> 16:30.742
Standard procedure in '70s cop flicks.

16:30.766 --> 16:32.710
Did Sadowski and Sanders get along?

16:36.456 --> 16:37.956
Worked together nine years.

16:38.266 --> 16:39.654
Neither filed a complaint

16:39.830 --> 16:41.163
or requested a transfer.

16:41.268 --> 16:42.746
What about the other inspector?

16:42.770 --> 16:43.770
Ah, Diane Russio.

16:44.332 --> 16:45.665
Something's up with her.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.705
She made Gibbs' spidey sense tingle.

16:48.704 --> 16:49.704
Don't touch that.

16:51.642 --> 16:53.475
Sanders' car could be a hot zone.

16:54.015 --> 16:55.181
This car? I doubt it.

17:02.140 --> 17:04.078
Rem is low. It's safe.

17:04.829 --> 17:05.829
After you, probie.

17:11.892 --> 17:12.892
Reeks of cigar.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.654
It's a manly scent good for you.

17:16.015 --> 17:18.182
You know what this guy
being poisoned reminds me of?

17:18.205 --> 17:19.205
A movie?

17:19.393 --> 17:20.559
Yeah, but what movie?

17:20.893 --> 17:22.226
A movie I've never seen?

17:22.579 --> 17:23.744
D. O. A. It's called.

17:24.141 --> 17:25.417
1950 film noir classic.

17:26.516 --> 17:28.116
This accountant goes to San
Francisco, parties all night,

17:28.140 --> 17:30.617
wakes up, finds he's
poisoned. He has 24 hours

17:30.641 --> 17:32.585
- to find his...
- Found something.

17:33.143 --> 17:34.143
Is it dangerous?

17:34.350 --> 17:35.350
Do you want kids?

17:36.096 --> 17:37.096
Kidding.

17:37.596 --> 17:38.759
Rem count's not that high.

17:38.783 --> 17:40.283
We should take it to X-ray.

17:41.971 --> 17:43.637
Let's see what we got in here.

17:46.346 --> 17:47.679
Body parts? Gym clothes.

17:49.032 --> 17:50.883
- Get them to Abby.
- Ziva called with a list of.

17:50.907 --> 17:54.184
Lieutenant Sanders' movements,
where he went, what he ate.

17:54.282 --> 17:55.446
We'll start at his apartment,

17:55.470 --> 17:57.747
collect these items,
sweep for radiation.

17:58.226 --> 17:59.885
Ziva figure out how she knew him?

17:59.909 --> 18:01.020
Personal connection.

18:02.942 --> 18:04.823
Ziva has personal connections?

18:10.533 --> 18:11.533
Lieutenant.

18:11.908 --> 18:12.908
Did I startle you?

18:14.220 --> 18:15.220
A little.

18:15.909 --> 18:17.009
I'd say I was paranoid,

18:17.033 --> 18:18.644
but someone just poisoned me.

18:19.032 --> 18:20.032
Who?

18:20.784 --> 18:22.281
Well, I've racked my brain

18:22.325 --> 18:24.332
for enemies at work, but I...

18:25.722 --> 18:27.055
I can't think of anyone.

18:28.659 --> 18:30.270
What about your private life?

18:30.348 --> 18:31.736
Do you have a girlfriend?

18:33.675 --> 18:35.884
Are you asking me in a
professional capacity?

18:35.908 --> 18:36.908
Yes.

18:37.972 --> 18:38.972
I don't have one.

18:39.909 --> 18:40.909
Why not?

18:41.096 --> 18:42.373
Professional follow-up.

18:42.922 --> 18:45.716
Well, I wouldn't date
anyone I worked with,

18:45.759 --> 18:47.448
and outside of work,
I've never met a woman

18:47.472 --> 18:49.199
who could understand why I do what I do.

18:49.223 --> 18:51.278
The focus, the risks, the sacrifices.

18:51.597 --> 18:54.485
They always want me to go
teach or go to law school.

18:55.034 --> 18:56.500
But I love what I do.

18:56.722 --> 18:58.699
I truly believe there are
good guys who need protection

18:58.723 --> 19:00.322
and bad guys who need monitoring.

19:00.346 --> 19:01.790
It's a mission, not a job.

19:02.285 --> 19:04.584
"All that is necessary
for evil to succeed

19:04.644 --> 19:07.208
is that good men do nothing."

19:10.850 --> 19:12.572
That's my favorite quote, ever.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.160
Sorry.

19:18.472 --> 19:19.583
Felt a little dizzy.

19:20.974 --> 19:22.474
I have to get you into bed.

19:24.860 --> 19:26.785
I'm not saying anything.

19:27.034 --> 19:29.031
Sorry, it's the English.

19:30.259 --> 19:32.262
How long do you think
he's going to be in here?

19:32.286 --> 19:33.286
Hey.

19:33.848 --> 19:34.848
Roy!

19:35.535 --> 19:36.535
Hi.

19:36.649 --> 19:38.570
I'm sorry, no contact.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.390
I can't believe this happened.

19:44.786 --> 19:46.230
You going to be all right?

19:47.161 --> 19:48.161
Well, I hope so.

20:08.679 --> 20:10.716
We'll probably just
cancel next week's trip.

20:10.740 --> 20:11.740
Which one?

20:11.865 --> 20:14.403
Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Russia.

20:14.427 --> 20:16.004
It's one of those "If this is Tuesday,

20:16.062 --> 20:17.989
it must be Tashkent" trips.

20:18.142 --> 20:19.729
Don't cancel.

20:19.865 --> 20:21.027
See if Howard's available.

20:21.051 --> 20:22.051
He's a good man.

20:23.741 --> 20:24.741
Carreful.

20:25.740 --> 20:27.616
Sorry. I'm a...

20:27.926 --> 20:29.037
I'm a bit wiped out.

20:29.491 --> 20:31.268
Oh, we'll let you get some rest.

20:31.615 --> 20:32.892
See you tomorrow, okay?

20:38.052 --> 20:39.216
I need to talk to you.

20:39.240 --> 20:41.740
It's about Lieutenant
Sanders' personal life.

20:41.865 --> 20:42.865
Um, he says

20:43.115 --> 20:44.726
he doesn't have a girlfriend,

20:44.990 --> 20:46.601
that he doesn't date, either.

20:46.927 --> 20:49.820
Hard to believe, but I think it's true.

20:51.489 --> 20:52.489
Mr. Sadowski,

20:52.741 --> 20:54.963
would you mind giving us a moment alone?

20:56.740 --> 20:58.128
I'll be at the elevators.

21:03.491 --> 21:04.546
You know something.

21:04.927 --> 21:05.927
It's about Brazil.

21:06.490 --> 21:08.532
When you two went back
to the hotel together.

21:08.556 --> 21:09.889
Roy tell you about that?

21:10.177 --> 21:11.177
No, my boss did.

21:12.182 --> 21:13.182
What happened?

21:13.552 --> 21:14.552
Nothing.

21:15.427 --> 21:16.427
Tell me.

21:16.992 --> 21:17.992
Nothing.

21:19.992 --> 21:22.221
I got a little drunk,
I knocked on his door,

21:22.245 --> 21:23.467
he wouldn't let me in.

21:24.054 --> 21:25.331
I was a complete idiot,

21:25.678 --> 21:27.455
and he was a complete gentleman.

21:28.178 --> 21:29.178
Or maybe he's gay.

21:29.617 --> 21:31.117
Oh, I don't think he's gay.

21:31.553 --> 21:32.553
How do you know?

21:32.682 --> 21:34.404
I saw the way he looked at you.

21:37.367 --> 21:38.779
The higher levels of
radiation are due to

21:38.803 --> 21:41.154
the concentration of
Lieutenant Sanders' sweat.

21:41.178 --> 21:42.955
He made his clothes radioactive,

21:42.992 --> 21:43.992
not vice versa.

21:50.868 --> 21:52.799
Abs, it's over.

21:56.054 --> 21:58.843
I just hate to see the
first one of the morning end.

21:58.867 --> 22:00.200
I did get one unexpected

22:00.304 --> 22:01.470
piece of information.

22:01.742 --> 22:02.964
Lieutenant Sanders

22:03.429 --> 22:06.762
had a computerized chip in his
left sneaker to log his workouts.

22:07.304 --> 22:09.637
That one of those
experimental DOD things?

22:09.928 --> 22:12.483
Uh, no. You can buy them
at any running store.

22:12.929 --> 22:15.695
It transmits into this.

22:18.758 --> 22:20.924
I was able to access his exercise logs.

22:21.383 --> 22:22.672
These are the last two weeks

22:22.696 --> 22:23.696
of his workout.

22:24.632 --> 22:25.632
He's a machine.

22:26.570 --> 22:28.736
Eight miles every day in under an hour.

22:29.007 --> 22:30.420
Lieutenant Sanders was poisoned...

22:30.444 --> 22:31.444
Right around here.

22:32.447 --> 22:33.609
His last two workouts,

22:33.633 --> 22:35.172
they were only slightly off pace.

22:35.196 --> 22:37.611
Does that tell you
something about the case?

22:37.635 --> 22:39.468
Tells me something about the man.

22:39.819 --> 22:40.819
Like what?

22:41.072 --> 22:43.460
Like he would have
made a damn good Marine.

22:50.383 --> 22:51.494
He's sleeping again?

22:51.946 --> 22:55.112
We took a walk around the
garden, and it knocked him out.

22:55.196 --> 22:57.196
We got the second test results back.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.787
Was the Prussian blue effective?

22:59.883 --> 23:00.883
No.

23:01.447 --> 23:04.546
Lieutenant Sanders' lymphocytes
are continuing to decrease

23:04.570 --> 23:05.903
and his radiation levels

23:06.070 --> 23:07.365
are higher than when he was admitted.

23:07.389 --> 23:08.944
That doesn't make any sense.

23:09.321 --> 23:11.376
It does if he's still being poisoned.

23:20.182 --> 23:21.470
There's no mistake, Gibbs.

23:21.494 --> 23:22.847
The doctor said Lieutenant Sanders'

23:22.871 --> 23:24.648
radiation levels are increasing.

23:25.184 --> 23:26.628
He's still being poisoned.

23:26.995 --> 23:28.828
Someone wanted to finish the job.

23:29.869 --> 23:32.533
Not a lot of people have access
to him: Nurses, doctors...

23:32.557 --> 23:34.001
People preparing his food.

23:35.244 --> 23:36.280
Could be a lot.

23:36.324 --> 23:38.033
Plus, he had two visitors from work

23:38.057 --> 23:39.334
yesterday: Diane Russio

23:39.619 --> 23:41.142
and Mark Sadowski.

23:41.219 --> 23:42.931
Were they alone with him?

23:43.057 --> 23:44.057
Yes.

23:45.621 --> 23:46.972
At one point, I went
to the vending machine.

23:46.996 --> 23:48.847
One of them could have
slipped it in his water.

23:48.871 --> 23:49.911
What about Tony and McGee?

23:50.246 --> 23:52.690
Have they followed up
on the list of locations?

23:52.870 --> 23:54.284
Swept Sanders' apartment, office,

23:54.308 --> 23:56.196
running path yesterday. All clean.

23:56.308 --> 23:57.481
They'll hit the rest today.

23:57.524 --> 23:59.549
This is starting to look
very targeted, Gibbs.

23:59.618 --> 24:02.847
Whoever did this is not just
after any nuclear inspector.

24:02.871 --> 24:05.223
Sanders know he's still being poisoned?

24:05.247 --> 24:06.224
Not yet.

24:06.248 --> 24:08.133
I'm worried it will increase his stress.

24:08.157 --> 24:09.157
Your call.

24:09.343 --> 24:10.781
You stick with him, Ziva.

24:10.805 --> 24:12.315
Like tattoos on Abby.

24:19.929 --> 24:21.876
I think this will make you feel better.

24:21.900 --> 24:25.139
They tested the pizza inside
the refrigerator and, um...

24:25.163 --> 24:26.876
you were right about Papa Don.

24:26.900 --> 24:27.915
Yes!

24:28.317 --> 24:29.317
Exonerated.

24:30.023 --> 24:31.123
Did they, um...

24:31.735 --> 24:34.391
did they find any clues, any answers?

24:34.415 --> 24:35.415
Not yet.

24:35.884 --> 24:37.449
But they're still looking.

24:37.473 --> 24:38.799
Well, tell them to hurry up.

24:38.843 --> 24:42.703
I want to know who
killed me before I die.

24:43.542 --> 24:44.542
Ziva.

24:46.907 --> 24:49.347
Can you do something else for me?

24:49.522 --> 24:50.522
Of course.

24:50.755 --> 24:52.605
Can you find me a lawyer?

24:53.202 --> 24:55.572
I think I need to write my will.

25:00.164 --> 25:03.068
Mark and Roy came here
a couple of times a week.

25:03.092 --> 25:04.552
Usually at lunchtime.

25:04.612 --> 25:07.592
You check out Roy's two
perfect targets hanging inside?

25:07.616 --> 25:08.616
Missed them.

25:08.997 --> 25:10.355
Which station did they use?

25:10.379 --> 25:11.796
We don't keep track.

25:11.820 --> 25:14.172
At lunchtime, it's first available.

25:14.196 --> 25:15.496
But if you really need to know,

25:15.520 --> 25:16.905
I got a security camera.

25:16.929 --> 25:20.557
Insurance made me put it in
last year after I got sued.

25:20.581 --> 25:21.558
Personal injury?

25:21.582 --> 25:22.812
Sexual harassment.

25:23.237 --> 25:24.503
See, I like to...

25:24.527 --> 25:27.407
come up behind a shooter
and correct his stance.

25:27.431 --> 25:28.771
Most appreciate it.

25:29.343 --> 25:31.193
One guy from Utah didn't.

25:31.396 --> 25:32.567
Bet I could correct your stance.

25:32.591 --> 25:34.130
I'm okay with my stance.

25:34.154 --> 25:37.088
Sure like to teach you how to
position your shoulders over your hips.

25:37.112 --> 25:38.550
Maybe we should get the security footage

25:38.574 --> 25:40.970
and review it back at the
office to see where they were.

25:41.958 --> 25:42.958
No need.

25:43.537 --> 25:46.147
I think we just found our hot zone.

25:49.353 --> 25:51.306
I have been working
for 30 hours straight.

25:51.330 --> 25:54.064
This is only my fourth cup of the day.

25:54.088 --> 25:55.862
Mossad. Hot liquid.

25:55.889 --> 25:57.909
I'd let her have it, McGee.

25:59.804 --> 26:00.804
Thanks.

26:02.147 --> 26:05.012
So you spend the night in
the lieutenant's room, huh?

26:05.779 --> 26:06.779
Yes.

26:07.022 --> 26:08.426
We stayed up late, talking.

26:08.450 --> 26:10.590
Yeah, I remember staying
up late in college...

26:10.614 --> 26:11.614
"talking."

26:12.042 --> 26:13.700
What's that look on your face?

26:14.499 --> 26:15.499
What look?

26:15.530 --> 26:16.818
Are you falling in
love with a dying man?

26:16.842 --> 26:18.043
- Of course not.
- Hey.

26:19.786 --> 26:21.423
The look on your face says you are.

26:21.447 --> 26:23.628
When did you become an expert on love?

26:23.652 --> 26:25.771
Last time I checked,
your idea of a long-term

26:25.808 --> 26:27.499
commitment was a three-day weekend.

26:28.202 --> 26:29.587
What's that look on your face?

26:29.611 --> 26:30.591
Nothing.

26:30.615 --> 26:31.592
I was just going to say that...

26:31.616 --> 26:32.905
Look, I know what you were going to say.

26:32.929 --> 26:35.820
The next time Lieutenant Sanders
and I stay up late "talking",

26:35.844 --> 26:37.220
we're going to use a lead condom.

26:37.244 --> 26:39.114
- Thank you.
- No, Ziva...

26:40.710 --> 26:43.667
I was going to say, I
hope he pulls through.

26:43.691 --> 26:45.350
But you should know that I found a photo

26:45.374 --> 26:46.682
of an attractive woman,

26:46.706 --> 26:49.076
a kid, and a husky in his desk.

26:51.850 --> 26:53.324
How'd he ingest the thallium?

26:53.348 --> 26:55.283
Well, they ate lunch at
the shooting range and.

26:55.307 --> 26:57.219
Abby's combing through
the physical evidence, but

26:57.243 --> 26:59.066
we still haven't found the smoking gun.

26:59.090 --> 27:00.752
We swept the Dumpsters
at the shooting range,

27:00.776 --> 27:02.605
but the levels were low.
Same with the kitchen.

27:02.629 --> 27:04.629
There were two food
preparers, two servers.

27:04.653 --> 27:05.756
They all scanned clean.

27:05.780 --> 27:07.621
So did Dee Dee, and she's the rather

27:07.645 --> 27:08.990
eccentric woman who runs the place.

27:09.014 --> 27:10.483
Then Roy, I'm sorry...

27:10.507 --> 27:12.215
Lieutenant Sanders must have

27:12.239 --> 27:14.232
been contaminated at
the point of consumption.

27:14.256 --> 27:17.876
I think someone spiked his
hamburger or his coffee.

27:19.940 --> 27:21.560
Who got near his food?

27:21.704 --> 27:23.222
I watched the security footage,

27:23.246 --> 27:25.571
and Mark Sadowski is
with him the whole time,

27:25.595 --> 27:27.361
but you can't see see
the table or the food.

27:27.385 --> 27:29.484
The cameras are trained
on the shooting stalls.

27:29.508 --> 27:31.482
Oh, believe me, you don't
want to know why that is.

27:31.506 --> 27:33.122
Someone could have come from the back

27:33.146 --> 27:34.141
and not been seen.

27:34.165 --> 27:36.229
Sadowski was at the
range and he was here,

27:36.276 --> 27:38.416
which places him at
both contamination sites.

27:38.440 --> 27:39.417
Bring him in.

27:39.441 --> 27:40.441
On it, boss.

27:41.580 --> 27:43.011
I thought I told you to stay

27:43.054 --> 27:44.653
with Lieutenant Sanders the whole time.

27:44.677 --> 27:46.204
Agent Lee's with him.

27:46.228 --> 27:48.078
He's making out his will.

27:48.406 --> 27:50.956
Can't die unless you see a lawyer.

27:51.832 --> 27:52.832
Hey.

27:54.225 --> 27:55.375
He may not die.

27:56.730 --> 27:58.180
He may pull through.

28:01.148 --> 28:02.149
Officer David,

28:02.297 --> 28:04.857
I need you to witness the document.

28:07.756 --> 28:09.556
In case you're wondering,

28:09.600 --> 28:11.620
I left it all to my sister.

28:12.066 --> 28:13.926
I hope she appreciates it.

28:14.051 --> 28:15.097
We fight a lot.

28:15.121 --> 28:16.998
Someday I'll tell you about my family.

28:17.022 --> 28:19.342
Yeah, well, don't wait too long.

28:20.277 --> 28:22.088
Does your sister have a husky?

28:22.112 --> 28:23.252
How'd you know?

28:23.276 --> 28:25.159
It is a nice addition to any family.

28:25.183 --> 28:26.563
Do you have a dog?

28:27.703 --> 28:28.703
No.

28:35.268 --> 28:37.528
I'll file this with the court.

28:38.252 --> 28:41.253
But I hope we don't need to
execute it for a very long,

28:41.277 --> 28:42.254
long time.

28:42.278 --> 28:44.019
Thank you, Agent Lee.

28:50.021 --> 28:50.998
Ziva,

28:51.022 --> 28:53.496
Abby sent back some of his things.

29:14.809 --> 29:18.005
You know a lot about handling
radioactive materials.

29:18.029 --> 29:19.299
Sure, for my job.

29:20.079 --> 29:21.101
You were at the shooting range

29:21.125 --> 29:23.067
with Lieutenant Sanders a few days ago.

29:23.091 --> 29:24.481
Yeah, we had lunch.

29:24.675 --> 29:25.827
You slipped him a little

29:25.851 --> 29:26.851
thallium.

29:28.489 --> 29:30.211
I've never touched thallium. Look,

29:30.235 --> 29:32.599
I had nothing to do with
Roy getting poisoned.

29:32.623 --> 29:33.600
Nothing.

29:33.624 --> 29:35.473
Skip the denials, tell me why.

29:36.624 --> 29:38.424
This is my favorite part.

29:38.869 --> 29:40.615
The part where Gibbs breaks him?

29:40.639 --> 29:41.616
No,

29:41.640 --> 29:43.105
the part right before Gibbs breaks him,

29:43.129 --> 29:46.209
when the guy still
thinks he has a chance.

29:47.275 --> 29:48.275
Why?

29:48.501 --> 29:50.198
- There is no "why."
- Why?

29:50.278 --> 29:51.260
I didn't do it!

29:51.284 --> 29:52.756
I would never hurt Roy.

29:52.780 --> 29:53.780
Sit down.

29:55.005 --> 29:55.985
He's my friend.

29:56.009 --> 29:58.168
We've traveled the world together.

29:58.192 --> 29:59.612
When I thought I had prostate cancer,

29:59.636 --> 30:01.865
he was the first person I called.

30:01.889 --> 30:03.562
So if you have any proof I did this,

30:03.586 --> 30:04.565
lay it out for me.

30:04.589 --> 30:05.679
Let me see it.

30:05.918 --> 30:08.178
'Cause I know it doesn't exist.

30:14.034 --> 30:15.244
He'll break him.

30:16.685 --> 30:18.261
I finished analyzing the debris

30:18.285 --> 30:20.116
that I vacuumed from the
shooting range gravel.

30:20.140 --> 30:21.940
Was it our prime suspect?

30:22.059 --> 30:23.059
You mean...

30:23.894 --> 30:24.871
Frenchie?

30:24.895 --> 30:25.872
No.

30:25.896 --> 30:28.432
The fry registered scant
radioactivity after it was dusted.

30:28.456 --> 30:30.605
None of the larger
items were contaminated,

30:30.629 --> 30:33.416
but the micro debris
was through the roof.

30:33.440 --> 30:36.348
Were you able to break
down its component?

30:36.372 --> 30:37.813
Well, it took me a while,

30:37.837 --> 30:39.697
but I isolated human skin,

30:39.780 --> 30:41.000
human hair, lint,

30:41.616 --> 30:44.066
tobacco ash, both large and small,

30:44.476 --> 30:45.816
salt, pepper, dirt,

30:46.507 --> 30:47.507
and pollen.

30:47.794 --> 30:48.794
Ducky?

30:49.571 --> 30:50.571
Ducky?

30:51.270 --> 30:52.270
He's gone.

30:55.934 --> 30:57.144
I gotta go, too.

31:03.564 --> 31:05.599
I guess when you gotta go, you gotta go.

31:06.845 --> 31:08.143
Make it fast, Duck.

31:08.167 --> 31:09.821
We found the smoking gun,

31:09.845 --> 31:11.822
with the emphasis on "smoking."

31:11.846 --> 31:14.578
Abby isolated large radioactive ash

31:14.602 --> 31:16.498
from the debris from the shooting range.

31:16.522 --> 31:17.972
It wasn't ingestion,

31:18.143 --> 31:19.409
it was inhalation.

31:19.433 --> 31:21.972
Someone injected the
thallium into the cigar.

31:21.996 --> 31:23.164
Yes, it's very efficient,

31:23.188 --> 31:25.923
too, because the lungs feed
directly into the bloodstream.

31:25.947 --> 31:28.231
Sadowski mentioned hitting the
bars with Lieutenant Sanders

31:28.255 --> 31:30.631
in Brazil for a cerveza
and a cigar. So...

31:30.755 --> 31:31.755
Wait, boss,

31:31.932 --> 31:34.082
I need to show you something.

31:36.267 --> 31:37.784
I really hope it's not that YouTube clip

31:37.808 --> 31:39.933
I sent him this morning
'cause it's a little...

31:41.687 --> 31:43.770
Now, I downloaded the security camera

31:43.794 --> 31:45.894
feed from the shooting range.

31:45.923 --> 31:47.259
Here's the isolated footage of

31:47.283 --> 31:49.863
Mark Sadowski and Lieutenant Sanders.

31:53.744 --> 31:56.113
If you had laced a cigar with thallium,

31:56.137 --> 31:58.041
would you stick around
to breathe in the smoke?

31:58.065 --> 31:59.085
It's not likely.

31:59.109 --> 32:00.861
It's like pulling the pin on a grenade,

32:00.885 --> 32:03.796
handing it to someone and
then standing beside them.

32:03.820 --> 32:06.803
Sadowski didn't know they were
contaminated with radiation.

32:12.051 --> 32:13.091
No, stay here.

32:19.713 --> 32:21.817
Explains why you couldn't break him.

32:21.841 --> 32:23.101
He didn't do it.

32:37.716 --> 32:38.693
Where are they?

32:38.717 --> 32:39.694
What are you talking about?

32:39.718 --> 32:40.802
The cigars you smoke when you go

32:40.826 --> 32:42.518
outside to get some fresh air.

32:43.064 --> 32:44.267
Okay, I had a puff or two.

32:44.291 --> 32:45.766
- I know the doctor said not to.
- No!

32:45.790 --> 32:46.890
Where are they?

32:49.490 --> 32:51.783
I had no idea you were so antismoking.

32:51.807 --> 32:52.830
I mean, honestly, at this point,

32:52.854 --> 32:55.822
I'd consider myself lucky to
live long enough to die of cancer.

32:55.846 --> 32:59.260
Look, Roy, these cigars
are laced with thallium.

33:01.128 --> 33:02.175
Were they a gift?

33:02.199 --> 33:05.432
I, uh... I bought them myself,
duty-free, Sao Paulo airport.

33:05.456 --> 33:06.645
Who else had access to these?

33:06.927 --> 33:09.378
They were in my desk until
I stuck them in my bag.

33:11.016 --> 33:12.016
Oh, man.

33:12.122 --> 33:13.377
Okay, okay, you need to relax.

33:13.787 --> 33:15.627
- You need to stay calm.
- It's all right, Roy.

33:15.697 --> 33:16.697
It's all right.

33:17.598 --> 33:19.598
Deep breaths now, take deep breaths.

33:20.414 --> 33:21.414
Keep breathing.

33:23.909 --> 33:25.949
Two out of three inspectors poisoned.

33:25.973 --> 33:27.636
Someone's targeting the agency.

33:27.660 --> 33:29.386
Make a lot of enemies
wherever they've been, boss.

33:29.410 --> 33:30.574
Or wherever they're going.

33:30.598 --> 33:32.324
You stick with Sadowski, DiNozzo.

33:32.348 --> 33:34.010
McGee, get Diane Russio in here.

33:34.034 --> 33:36.256
She's the only inspector who isn't sick.

33:36.284 --> 33:37.284
Yet.

33:37.973 --> 33:40.528
We do a dozen inspections
a year, Agent Gibbs.

33:41.224 --> 33:42.946
In a dozen different countries.

33:43.411 --> 33:44.577
People don't like us,

33:44.849 --> 33:45.904
but I can't believe

33:46.286 --> 33:48.230
any government would sanction this.

33:48.848 --> 33:49.848
Thank you.

33:50.225 --> 33:51.697
We all got tested after Roy.

33:51.721 --> 33:53.109
My results were negative.

33:54.286 --> 33:55.341
Am I still at risk?

33:56.596 --> 33:57.651
Low-level exposure.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.174
Lieutenant Sanders was the target.

34:00.221 --> 34:02.054
You have an inspection next week?

34:02.474 --> 34:04.085
Roy insisted we still go,

34:05.224 --> 34:06.446
but now that Mark's sick..

34:06.663 --> 34:07.640
Where?

34:07.664 --> 34:08.664
That's classified.

34:09.913 --> 34:11.887
We prefer it if they
don't know we're coming.

34:11.911 --> 34:12.911
Need to know.

34:15.222 --> 34:16.944
Russia, Pakistan and Uzbekistan.

34:20.097 --> 34:21.429
Names of the facilities?

34:23.349 --> 34:25.181
- MTAC Operations.
- I need satellite time.

34:25.248 --> 34:26.797
I'll get the schedule,
sir. When do you need it?

34:26.822 --> 34:28.286
Now.

34:29.038 --> 34:30.014
Last one, boss.

34:30.039 --> 34:31.205
Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

34:31.851 --> 34:34.185
Image of the Tashkent
reactor stabilizing.

34:34.476 --> 34:36.012
Before the fall of the Soviet Union,

34:36.036 --> 34:37.257
Uzbekistan was the top

34:37.603 --> 34:39.603
producer of weapons-grade materials.

34:39.788 --> 34:42.012
- Yeah? And After?
- They dismantled the centrifuge,

34:42.036 --> 34:43.704
but if they wanted to
put it back together...

34:43.728 --> 34:46.327
They'd bring the pieces in
with heavy equipment trucks,

34:46.351 --> 34:47.351
like these.

34:47.725 --> 34:48.725
Lot of activity.

34:49.226 --> 34:51.337
Looks like they're building something.

34:51.411 --> 34:52.467
Or pulling it down.

34:52.498 --> 34:54.201
I need a shot from earlier this week.

34:54.225 --> 34:55.449
Try the same location

34:55.493 --> 34:57.406
- 96 hours ago.
- Accessing now.

34:58.934 --> 35:00.434
Someone's expecting guests.

35:00.873 --> 35:02.150
Get that footage to DOD

35:02.184 --> 35:03.961
and IAEA headquarters in Vienna.

35:07.345 --> 35:08.798
- DiNozzo.
- Hey.

35:08.848 --> 35:10.664
Someone tipped off Uzbekistan.

35:11.684 --> 35:13.405
Ask Sadowski who knew.

35:14.450 --> 35:15.600
Sadowski's out of it, boss.

35:15.624 --> 35:16.784
The doctor sedated him.

35:16.808 --> 35:18.196
Lieutenant Sanders, then.

35:18.439 --> 35:19.439
Checking.

35:20.309 --> 35:21.309
McGee,

35:21.499 --> 35:22.972
I want bank records for everyone

35:22.996 --> 35:24.218
working at the agency.

35:24.435 --> 35:26.379
I want details for every inspection

35:26.626 --> 35:28.126
ever done on that facility.

35:36.750 --> 35:38.475
Feel like I'm running a marathon.

35:38.499 --> 35:40.980
- You are.
- I called my parents.

35:41.315 --> 35:42.426
Mom's taking it bad.

35:43.184 --> 35:45.406
The good news is, Dad's going to fix it.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.100
They're on their way here,

35:47.124 --> 35:49.036
and he's going to turn it all around.

35:49.060 --> 35:50.171
Call in some favors.

35:50.311 --> 35:51.598
Ask the right questions.

35:51.622 --> 35:54.177
- Because every problem has a solution.
- Exactly.

35:54.748 --> 35:56.662
God, he sounds a lot like my father.

35:56.686 --> 35:57.741
He was tough on me,

35:57.874 --> 36:00.255
but I made him proud.

36:00.750 --> 36:02.250
Do they have far to travel?

36:03.379 --> 36:04.379
Too far.

36:05.125 --> 36:06.602
They'll need to be here anyway.

36:06.626 --> 36:07.626
Decisions to make.

36:08.999 --> 36:10.665
I'd like for you to meet them.

36:10.810 --> 36:12.010
- Is that weird?
- No.

36:12.562 --> 36:14.006
I would like to meet them.

36:19.189 --> 36:20.189
How is he?

36:20.939 --> 36:21.939
He's fighting.

36:22.124 --> 36:23.735
Gibbs has a question for him.

36:23.812 --> 36:25.367
I think he just fell asleep.

36:31.374 --> 36:32.374
Lieutenant?

36:33.251 --> 36:34.306
Lieutenant Sanders?

36:34.751 --> 36:35.806
- Ziva?
- I'm here.

36:35.999 --> 36:38.033
Agent DiNozzo needs
to ask you a question.

36:39.690 --> 36:40.967
Who knew you were going

36:40.999 --> 36:42.332
to Uzbekistan next week?

36:43.311 --> 36:44.311
Classified.

36:44.438 --> 36:45.938
Who decided where you'd go?

36:47.187 --> 36:48.187
My decision.

36:48.687 --> 36:49.687
Short list.

36:50.251 --> 36:51.528
Kept everyone guessing.

36:51.812 --> 36:52.978
But who did you tell?

36:54.438 --> 36:55.438
Roy?

36:55.966 --> 36:57.224
Lieutenant?

36:57.875 --> 36:59.097
Who did you tell, Roy?

37:00.127 --> 37:01.971
Mark. Told Mark.

37:01.995 --> 37:03.187
You done?

37:08.875 --> 37:10.097
Who else did you tell?

37:11.438 --> 37:14.013
Roy? Anyone else?

37:14.252 --> 37:15.252
Diane.

37:15.440 --> 37:16.440
Just...

37:16.686 --> 37:18.585
Just Mark and Diane.

37:19.813 --> 37:20.813
Diane.

37:20.939 --> 37:21.939
Okay.

37:23.188 --> 37:24.188
Thank you.

37:33.441 --> 37:34.979
Hey, boss, the lieutenant says

37:35.003 --> 37:37.663
only two others knew he
was going to Uzbekistan,

37:37.687 --> 37:39.409
Mark Sadowski and Diane Russio.

37:39.688 --> 37:40.688
How is he?

37:40.814 --> 37:41.814
He's fading fast.

37:45.632 --> 37:48.042
Boss, inspectors have
been back to Uzbekistan

37:48.066 --> 37:49.899
six times in the past four years.

37:50.688 --> 37:52.727
Next week's inspection would
have been lucky number seven.

37:52.751 --> 37:54.727
Sanders has been at every one of them.

37:54.751 --> 37:55.845
Makes him an expert.

37:55.875 --> 37:56.876
If anything had changed,

37:56.920 --> 37:58.917
he's the guy that would have noticed.

37:58.941 --> 38:00.663
Explains why they targeted him.

38:00.937 --> 38:01.915
What makes you think

38:01.939 --> 38:02.994
it was them, McGee?

38:03.645 --> 38:04.622
Dr. Mallard.

38:04.646 --> 38:05.623
Hey, Doc.

38:05.647 --> 38:07.370
I need you to check something.

38:09.771 --> 38:10.771
The other side.

38:17.703 --> 38:20.371
Well, you know you've been
in the hospital too long

38:20.395 --> 38:22.372
when you've figured
out the vending machine.

38:22.396 --> 38:24.284
You think I've been here too long?

38:25.332 --> 38:26.554
You want some of this?

38:26.707 --> 38:27.818
That's Roy's sister.

38:28.458 --> 38:29.747
The woman in the photo,

38:29.771 --> 38:31.604
the one with the kid and the dog.

38:32.521 --> 38:33.798
I had to ask him, Ziva.

38:34.021 --> 38:35.021
I know.

38:38.329 --> 38:39.329
Are you okay?

38:39.458 --> 38:41.069
Part of me just wants to run.

38:42.204 --> 38:43.808
You know, I can't believe
this is happening to me.

38:43.832 --> 38:45.748
To me, of all people.

38:46.582 --> 38:49.359
Well, you shouldn't take
it as a sign of weakness.

38:49.396 --> 38:51.308
Well, then how should I take it, Tony?

38:51.332 --> 38:53.276
Character-building?
Life-affirming?

38:53.455 --> 38:55.843
Somehow I don't think
Roy sees it that way.

38:58.832 --> 38:59.832
I'm sorry.

39:00.398 --> 39:01.398
Sorry.

39:02.704 --> 39:03.704
Ziva?

39:09.397 --> 39:11.063
I'm dying of boredom in there.

39:11.835 --> 39:12.946
It's okay, I got you.

39:14.027 --> 39:15.027
Hey...

39:16.147 --> 39:18.035
what's a guy got to do to get a...

39:18.308 --> 39:21.490
pretty girl to take
a walk in the garden?

39:22.463 --> 39:25.001
Roy, you shouldn't be out of bed.

39:25.025 --> 39:26.002
You need to be back in bed.

39:26.026 --> 39:27.921
- It's okay, Doctor, I can manage.
- No, he needs to be back in...

39:27.945 --> 39:29.228
Dr. Hass, excuse me.

39:29.270 --> 39:30.595
Can I speak to you for a second?

39:30.638 --> 39:32.099
I think... I think I
may have been exposed.

39:32.123 --> 39:33.738
I don't know how, and I don't mean

39:33.781 --> 39:34.758
to be an alarmist, but I got

39:34.782 --> 39:36.783
the burning sensation and the headaches

39:36.822 --> 39:38.112
and the vomiting and the...

39:38.174 --> 39:39.801
- whole thing.
- Diarrhea? You got the diarrhea?

39:39.825 --> 39:42.125
Yeah, like a tap, and
it just hit me, and I...

39:42.149 --> 39:43.376
Okay, let's, uh, sit you down.

39:43.400 --> 39:44.920
We're going to need to run some tests.

39:46.339 --> 39:47.339
Ah, Jethro.

39:47.650 --> 39:48.761
As per your request,

39:48.962 --> 39:50.876
I've reviewed the results of the tests

39:50.900 --> 39:52.622
carried out on the agency staff

39:52.776 --> 39:55.314
after it was confirmed that
the lieutenant had been exposed.

39:55.338 --> 39:57.726
And I... I found what
you were looking for.

39:58.400 --> 40:00.455
Trace amounts of ferric ferrocyanide.

40:01.275 --> 40:02.275
Prussian blue.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.066
Someone was taking it prophylactically.

40:06.216 --> 40:08.104
As a preventative measure, Jethro.

40:08.169 --> 40:09.169
Who?

40:10.543 --> 40:11.543
Her.

40:15.859 --> 40:16.836
Got her, boss.

40:16.860 --> 40:19.804
$50,000 in cash deposited
over the past three months.

40:20.107 --> 40:21.707
Closed the account this morning.

40:21.731 --> 40:22.833
Shifted the funds offshore.

40:22.857 --> 40:24.587
Looks like she's about to do a runner.

40:24.611 --> 40:25.611
Where is she now?

40:25.665 --> 40:27.553
Just checked. Still in the office.

40:28.416 --> 40:30.285
No, I don't want to travel via London.

40:30.344 --> 40:31.635
I want a direct flight.

40:31.683 --> 40:34.364
Yeah. Yes, I know it's
last minute, but I...

40:34.817 --> 40:36.134
Look, there must be other carriers...

40:36.158 --> 40:37.328
Miss Russio?

40:37.396 --> 40:39.257
Agent Gibbs.

40:39.299 --> 40:40.392
Your travel coordinator,

40:40.416 --> 40:42.070
- Holly Stegman...
- Okay, she just

40:42.113 --> 40:44.363
left me here with this
mess, flight plans...

40:44.422 --> 40:45.399
Which way?

40:45.423 --> 40:46.912
- I'm trying to...
- Which way?!

40:48.106 --> 40:49.666
Parking garage.

40:54.996 --> 40:55.996
Come on.

40:57.934 --> 40:58.934
Stop!

41:02.812 --> 41:03.812
Stop!

41:16.811 --> 41:17.788
No.

41:17.812 --> 41:19.886
No. Wait. W - Wait.

41:19.997 --> 41:20.997
Out of the car.

41:21.311 --> 41:22.811
No. I didn't mean to do it.

41:23.061 --> 41:24.116
I couldn't kill Roy

41:24.561 --> 41:26.505
any more than I could run over you!

41:26.747 --> 41:28.135
I wanted to make him sick

41:28.497 --> 41:30.385
so he couldn't travel, that's all.

41:30.810 --> 41:31.921
He would have known.

41:32.624 --> 41:35.223
He would have realized
it was either Mark or me.

41:35.247 --> 41:36.247
Just tell me... Wait!

41:36.930 --> 41:38.477
Tell me I didn't kill him.

41:40.887 --> 41:43.563
No. No. No.

41:44.140 --> 41:45.416
I didn't mean to kill him.

41:45.459 --> 41:47.007
She could have killed you, boss.

42:06.198 --> 42:08.350
What a perfect day for a run.

42:11.154 --> 42:12.931
I'd even consider a double loop.

42:14.654 --> 42:16.098
I have something of yours.

42:23.030 --> 42:25.278
I remember you now.

42:29.529 --> 42:31.806
All those mornings,
I ran right past you.

42:32.403 --> 42:33.403
Youblastedpast me.

42:36.307 --> 42:37.443
I, uh...

42:37.467 --> 42:40.744
I used to put in a little extra
kick to impress the ladies.

42:42.342 --> 42:43.342
Well, it worked.

42:50.847 --> 42:53.013
I'm sorry we never got to run together.

42:56.655 --> 42:57.655
Me, too.

43:00.217 --> 43:02.328
Do you think you would have noticed...

43:04.280 --> 43:05.780
that I was no longer there?

43:08.155 --> 43:09.543
That I'd stopped running?

43:12.093 --> 43:13.537
Yes, I would have noticed.

43:15.218 --> 43:16.940
I would have missed seeing you.

43:20.530 --> 43:22.695
But eventually, you
would have forgotten me.

43:22.719 --> 43:23.719
Yes.

43:27.843 --> 43:29.120
I won't forget you now.
