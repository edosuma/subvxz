Every minute of the day,
we have a free choice.

00:14.870 --> 00:17.023
Every one of us has a right to choose.

00:18.810 --> 00:22.173
Our choices affect the rest of our lives.

00:24.840 --> 00:28.003
Some of these choices are more
important, and some are less.

00:29.080 --> 00:32.688
I believe wholeheartedly
that all is foreseen,

00:32.689 --> 00:34.423
but freedom of choice is given.

00:39.040 --> 00:42.828
We all have endless possibilities
within the lives we lead.

00:42.830 --> 00:46.413
I'm sure you think to yourself
all that time, what if?

00:50.260 --> 00:54.203
What if I had proposed
to my first girlfriend?

00:56.520 --> 00:59.233
What if I had moved to New York?

01:01.290 --> 01:03.968
When we step outside of our comfort zone,

01:03.970 --> 01:06.838
amazing things can happen to us.

01:06.840 --> 01:09.728
But what does it take in order for us

01:09.730 --> 01:12.213
to actually get out of our comfort zone?

01:13.908 --> 01:15.158
Good morning.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.340
I hope this is how you take your coffee.

01:34.050 --> 01:35.400
Did you eat anything today?

01:38.140 --> 01:39.053
No, but...

01:40.470 --> 01:41.673
coffee's a good start.

01:51.250 --> 01:52.500
Today's lunch is on me.

01:54.876 --> 01:55.976
I want you to take it.

02:00.750 --> 02:01.583
I've got to go.

02:19.160 --> 02:22.538
All right guys, I have got amazing news.

02:22.540 --> 02:23.718
Cleveland came back to win

02:23.720 --> 02:26.098
after being down three games to one.

02:26.100 --> 02:28.108
Nobody's ever done that before!

02:28.110 --> 02:31.588
We just made a ton of money.

02:31.590 --> 02:34.373
We don't have to work for like six months.

02:36.190 --> 02:39.233
The timing was perfect, 'cause
I could really use a rest.

02:40.794 --> 02:44.039
It will be very good for my health.

02:44.041 --> 02:45.088
What?

02:45.090 --> 02:46.789
Don't you have anything to say?

03:47.290 --> 03:49.740
Hi, I need to make an
appointment with Dr. Adams.

03:50.870 --> 03:52.388
Three weeks?

03:52.390 --> 03:54.123
All right, what about the alternate?

03:57.320 --> 03:59.748
Okay, make an appointment with her.

03:59.750 --> 04:00.918
No, I need it as soon as possible.

04:00.920 --> 04:01.893
Can I get in today?

04:03.280 --> 04:05.298
No, it's okay, I'll just come in and wait.

04:05.300 --> 04:06.213
All right, thanks.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.278
So how late
did you stay last night?

04:12.280 --> 04:13.111
Seven.

04:13.113 --> 04:13.958
I got it all done, though.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.482
Everything is covered for the meeting.

04:16.483 --> 04:19.098
Is it okay that we let
them have the recipes?

04:19.100 --> 04:21.399
We can save all the
recipes on a hard drive.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.118
We managed to keep up with our deadline.

04:25.120 --> 04:26.438
We're just waiting on a final call

04:26.440 --> 04:27.828
to set up the meeting for tomorrow.

04:27.830 --> 04:28.968
Well, all the recipes are done,

04:28.970 --> 04:31.183
and we'll just wait for
them to sign the contract.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.778
I know you don't want to see him,

04:35.780 --> 04:39.494
but we're going to have to
invite him to the meeting.

04:39.496 --> 04:40.796
I don't mind seeing him.

04:41.708 --> 04:43.008
He's still my best friend.

04:45.470 --> 04:46.403
You're the best.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.063
I'll call him right now.

05:05.770 --> 05:08.268
I will have you know that
kids carry lots of diseases

05:08.270 --> 05:11.478
and viruses that they get
from other kids at school.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.383
You bring home new germs every day.

05:19.210 --> 05:20.041
All right, I'm sorry.

05:20.043 --> 05:22.128
I'm just not used to
being around children.

05:22.130 --> 05:23.843
I think it's very unhealthy.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.138
Did you get all your shots?

05:30.140 --> 05:32.418
You're betting on the wrong team.

05:32.420 --> 05:33.251
This one?

05:33.253 --> 05:34.765
Yeah, they're gonna lose.

05:34.767 --> 05:35.936
Yeah, that's a lock.

05:35.938 --> 05:37.222
- No.
- Look.

05:37.224 --> 05:38.055
Look at that.

05:38.057 --> 05:39.491
That's how much they made me last time.

05:39.493 --> 05:40.518
It's never gonna work.

05:40.520 --> 05:43.652
No, I'm not gonna bet against them.

05:43.654 --> 05:44.508
If you want to lose.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.987
All right.

05:45.989 --> 05:46.820
There's no way.

05:46.822 --> 05:47.898
All right, I'll do it.

05:47.900 --> 05:48.731
Hi, mom.

05:48.733 --> 05:49.758
Hey, sweetie.

05:49.760 --> 05:50.818
How was school today?

05:50.820 --> 05:51.651
Good.

05:51.653 --> 05:52.484
Yeah?

05:52.486 --> 05:53.786
Is your cough any better today?

05:53.788 --> 05:56.001
I think so, I don't know.

05:56.003 --> 05:57.053
I hope so.

05:57.970 --> 06:00.705
Do you mind sticking around
for one more patient?

06:00.707 --> 06:01.538
Okay, sure.

06:01.540 --> 06:02.540
I'm sorry.

06:03.860 --> 06:04.748
Mr. Wiley.

06:04.750 --> 06:05.581
Yeah.

06:05.583 --> 06:06.778
Hi, I'm Dr. Kareem.

06:06.780 --> 06:07.654
Hi, nice to meet you.

06:07.656 --> 06:08.487
Nice to meet you.

06:08.489 --> 06:09.320
You too.

06:09.322 --> 06:10.418
I can take you in back if you're ready.

06:10.420 --> 06:11.253
I am ready.

06:12.550 --> 06:14.293
Right this way.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.053
Okay, deep breath in.

06:18.860 --> 06:19.968
Good.

06:19.970 --> 06:20.803
Again.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.300
Okay, one more time.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.711
Good.

06:28.713 --> 06:29.796
I know you.

06:30.646 --> 06:31.477
Right.

06:31.479 --> 06:32.630
No, really, we've met before.

06:32.632 --> 06:34.049
Mm-hm.

06:35.500 --> 06:36.331
What?

06:36.333 --> 06:38.268
I'm not just trying to pick up on you.

06:38.270 --> 06:40.798
Well, not just trying to pick up on you.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.113
I'll figure it out.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.153
April and David's wedding.

06:47.560 --> 06:48.689
You're the sister, right?

06:48.691 --> 06:49.721
Yeah!

06:49.723 --> 06:51.288
Wow, small world!

06:51.290 --> 06:53.018
Yeah, David's a good friend of mine.

06:53.020 --> 06:55.348
Oh, okay, yeah.

06:55.350 --> 06:57.241
I'm sorry, I don't...

06:57.243 --> 06:59.782
I don't remember meeting you.

06:59.784 --> 07:00.778
Ah, that's just 'cause your brain's full

07:00.780 --> 07:02.708
of all that medical knowledge.

07:02.710 --> 07:03.543
That is true.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.878
Look, I'm not offended
that you don't remember me,

07:08.880 --> 07:11.127
even though I did ask you to dance.

07:11.129 --> 07:12.551
I feel bad.

07:12.553 --> 07:13.386
I'm sorry.

07:16.987 --> 07:18.818
Oh, man, my heart rate.

07:18.820 --> 07:20.420
It's just beating like a mother!

07:21.440 --> 07:22.390
Well you're good!

07:23.370 --> 07:25.423
Yeah, all your results are normal.

07:28.420 --> 07:30.818
Do you think I need to
start taking beta blockers?

07:30.820 --> 07:32.370
No!

07:32.372 --> 07:35.028
Besides, how do you even
know about beta blockers?

07:35.030 --> 07:36.268
Well, I read.

07:36.270 --> 07:37.175
A lot.

07:39.110 --> 07:41.718
Well you have nothing to worry about.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.620
You're actually in really good health.

07:47.590 --> 07:48.421
You're fine.

07:48.423 --> 07:49.670
Come on, I'll walk you out.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.455
After you.

07:53.457 --> 07:56.532
Oh, thank you.

08:07.430 --> 08:08.452
Hi, April.

08:08.454 --> 08:09.838
How are you?

08:09.840 --> 08:10.671
I'm fine.

08:10.673 --> 08:11.506
Come in please.

08:15.550 --> 08:16.728
Where is David?

08:16.730 --> 08:17.730
Oh, he's not here.

08:19.620 --> 08:22.370
I had the feeling you were
gonna give me some bad news.

08:23.390 --> 08:24.223
Well...

08:25.530 --> 08:26.963
Your studies came back.

08:28.520 --> 08:29.803
And...

08:31.050 --> 08:31.913
unfortunately...

08:33.750 --> 08:34.700
they're not normal.

08:36.220 --> 08:39.908
Do you remember the
miscarriage that you had?

08:39.909 --> 08:43.028
Because of it, there is extensive damage

08:43.030 --> 08:46.738
to your uterine wall,
and you have a syndrome

08:46.740 --> 08:50.158
called Asherman syndrome,
which make pregnancy

08:50.160 --> 08:51.443
very, very difficult.

08:55.070 --> 08:55.903
I'm sorry.

08:58.517 --> 08:59.767
Can I get you some water?

09:02.590 --> 09:03.421
What?

09:03.423 --> 09:04.256
Can I get you some water?

09:06.210 --> 09:08.003
Oh, um...

09:11.310 --> 09:12.143
Sure.

09:17.648 --> 09:19.718
I mean, I was starving.

09:19.720 --> 09:20.918
Starving!

09:20.920 --> 09:23.518
And yet I gave you the last apple

09:23.520 --> 09:24.668
even though I knew you just had

09:24.670 --> 09:26.588
a huge sandwich two hours before that.

09:26.590 --> 09:28.528
Oh, man, your stomach was growling.

09:28.530 --> 09:30.775
And you're like, "No,
baby, you should eat it.

09:30.777 --> 09:33.427
"Don't worry, it's gonna go
bad if you don't eat it."

09:34.350 --> 09:36.388
We really should have
gotten a map for the road.

09:36.390 --> 09:38.178
How was I supposed to
know we'd run out of gas

09:38.180 --> 09:39.678
in the middle of the desert?

09:39.680 --> 09:40.728
You're the man, you're supposed

09:40.730 --> 09:41.758
to take care of these things.

09:41.760 --> 09:43.360
I'm supposed to pack the meals,

09:43.362 --> 09:44.963
and you're supposed to
take care of the road.

09:47.850 --> 09:49.000
God, I've missed you.

09:50.720 --> 09:51.870
How long this has been?

09:52.890 --> 09:53.913
16 days.

09:58.190 --> 10:00.340
Still sure you want
to file these papers?

10:01.610 --> 10:05.628
Look, I don't want to
waste your time, okay?

10:05.630 --> 10:07.053
I'm not ready for kids.

10:09.990 --> 10:11.878
I respect your decision.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.743
I just think it's a huge mistake.

10:15.820 --> 10:18.470
You deserve someone who's
gonna fulfill your needs.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.788
Okay, don't give me that face.

10:23.790 --> 10:24.623
What face?

10:25.720 --> 10:27.288
You're a face.

10:27.290 --> 10:28.123
Stop.

10:30.590 --> 10:31.478
- Thank you.
- Okay, I'll cover my face.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.311
That's better.

10:32.313 --> 10:34.148
Listen, guys, it's very simple.

10:34.150 --> 10:36.658
We went over the details many times.

10:36.660 --> 10:39.543
All we have to do at this
point is sign the contracts.

10:42.620 --> 10:44.613
What about paragraph 57?

10:46.370 --> 10:47.368
Can we revise it?

10:47.370 --> 10:50.983
I feel like Mrs. Rogan's
recipes are not being protected.

10:52.020 --> 10:55.143
Do you have any other
concerns other than that?

10:58.290 --> 10:59.758
Nope.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.593
No.

11:09.650 --> 11:11.568
All right, may we have the room?

11:11.570 --> 11:13.050
We need a few minutes.

11:32.498 --> 11:34.168
Let them change 57.

11:34.170 --> 11:37.208
We just need them to sign
the contract, revised or not.

11:37.210 --> 11:38.043
Come see this.

11:42.691 --> 11:45.578
They'll have no way to
protect those recipes.

11:45.580 --> 11:46.413
I checked.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.558
All right.

11:51.560 --> 11:52.393
Okay.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.498
I want nothing to do with them.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.950
That's okay, I'll go
tell them the deal is off.

12:03.850 --> 12:06.218
Do we need to find another factory now?

12:06.220 --> 12:08.458
Either another factory
or another sponsor,

12:08.460 --> 12:12.128
but don't worry, we've got
plenty of time for a solution.

12:12.130 --> 12:13.233
Oh my god!

12:15.040 --> 12:17.033
Four years of all that work, just gone.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.630
I could really use a drink right now.

12:21.510 --> 12:23.510
I actually really need to talk to you.

12:25.550 --> 12:26.918
You two grab a drink,

12:26.920 --> 12:28.920
and we'll figure something out tomorrow.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.073
All right, yes!

12:38.230 --> 12:39.228
Oh, hey, it's you!

12:39.230 --> 12:40.488
Hey, I won because of you!

12:40.490 --> 12:41.598
Check it out.

12:41.600 --> 12:42.928
How did you know?

12:42.930 --> 12:44.668
Next time, we go 50-50.

12:44.670 --> 12:47.058
Huh, we'll se about that.

12:47.060 --> 12:48.760
Believe me, I can use the money.

12:49.661 --> 12:50.543
All right, deal.

12:51.790 --> 12:53.628
So, uh, what'd your mom say?

12:53.630 --> 12:54.913
Are you contagious?

12:56.710 --> 12:58.798
Oh, oh, hey!

12:58.800 --> 13:00.625
Mr. Wiley, how are you doing?

13:00.627 --> 13:01.968
I'm doing a little better,

13:01.970 --> 13:03.268
but I think I'm gonna have to set

13:03.270 --> 13:05.728
another appointment with you very soon.

13:05.730 --> 13:07.238
Oh, yeah, well, I can see

13:07.240 --> 13:08.918
that your pulse is racing fast again.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.199
Huh, right.

13:11.337 --> 13:12.254
This thing.

13:13.248 --> 13:14.278
Mom, can we sit with him?

13:14.280 --> 13:16.375
Oh, honey, no, I don't
want to bother Mr. Wiley.

13:16.377 --> 13:18.498
Wiley Oh, no, really,
it's no problem at all.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.808
Please, have a seat.

13:19.810 --> 13:20.728
No, no, seriously.

13:20.730 --> 13:22.058
I mean, there's other tables open,

13:22.060 --> 13:23.488
and he still kinda has a cough,

13:23.490 --> 13:25.368
so we'll just sit over there, it's okay.

13:25.370 --> 13:26.628
Take care, Mr. Wiley.

13:26.630 --> 13:27.463
Thank you.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.928
So glad we got desert for later!

13:35.930 --> 13:37.497
Looks good, huh?

13:38.743 --> 13:40.078
We'll save it for when we get home.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.358
So, I've never seen
you guys in here before.

13:42.360 --> 13:43.974
Do you eat here often?

13:43.976 --> 13:44.807
Yeah.

13:44.809 --> 13:46.048
I mean, we like the food.

13:46.050 --> 13:46.949
It's good.

13:46.951 --> 13:47.782
Yeah.

13:47.784 --> 13:48.615
Oh, honey!

13:48.617 --> 13:49.448
- Let me get you a kleenex.
- Thank you.

13:49.450 --> 13:50.283
You're welcome.

13:54.550 --> 13:57.273
So, is your dad joining
us for lunch today?

13:58.314 --> 14:00.933
You don't
stand a chance with my mom.

14:24.460 --> 14:26.893
Looks like you're having
a worse day than I am.

14:31.240 --> 14:32.390
I'm Steven, by the way.

14:36.860 --> 14:37.948
Nice to meet you, Steven.

14:37.950 --> 14:38.803
I'm Sharon.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.123
Did you have anything to eat today?

14:46.070 --> 14:47.670
No, but I've lost my appetite.

14:49.170 --> 14:50.370
That makes both of us.

14:52.120 --> 14:54.167
You want to talk about it?

14:58.870 --> 15:01.533
Something really unpleasant
happened to me today.

15:05.610 --> 15:06.723
But I feel like...

15:07.730 --> 15:09.088
your troubles are bigger than mine.

15:09.090 --> 15:10.753
It's embarrassing to talk about.

15:18.760 --> 15:22.403
Well you seem like
a good person, and...

15:23.560 --> 15:25.608
my troubles aside, you can talk about it

15:25.610 --> 15:27.110
if it'll make you feel better.

15:35.890 --> 15:38.848
I just realized the
people I was supposed

15:38.850 --> 15:42.123
to close a deal with were
planning to steal from me.

15:44.350 --> 15:46.613
I didn't even see it coming.

15:48.430 --> 15:49.263
Nowhere.

15:53.662 --> 15:54.745
It's the end.

15:56.477 --> 15:58.377
But did they actually take anything?

16:03.400 --> 16:05.463
You saved yourself from these thieves.

16:11.403 --> 16:13.320
It's a pretty good day.

16:18.630 --> 16:19.893
I think I'm relieved.

16:21.660 --> 16:23.460
I don't even need to see my therapy.

16:26.842 --> 16:28.009
You know what?

16:30.577 --> 16:32.143
Let me give you something.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.253
Take this.

16:35.890 --> 16:37.540
You deserve it more than he does.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.313
I'm serious.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.090
You could use it.

16:53.135 --> 16:56.901
And you know, this more importantly,

16:56.903 --> 16:58.703
I want you to have my business card.

17:00.403 --> 17:03.220
It has my office number, my address.

17:04.069 --> 17:05.770
It's just right around the corner.

17:06.609 --> 17:09.542
Please don't hesitate if
you need anything at all.

17:17.880 --> 17:18.713
Thank you.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.218
So you did well, huh?

17:28.220 --> 17:29.948
Yeah, I won big.

17:29.950 --> 17:31.403
Yeah, I'm on fire.

17:33.050 --> 17:34.658
And what's with this place, by the way?

17:34.660 --> 17:36.178
We never come here.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.935
Oh, well I ran in to Lisa once here,

17:37.937 --> 17:40.158
and I was kinda thinking
she might show up.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.073
I'd really love to see her again.

17:42.075 --> 17:46.018
Well you know she's got a
child, and you don't like kids.

17:46.020 --> 17:47.798
She's got the whole package.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.888
Yeah, but this kid's not like most kids.

17:50.890 --> 17:52.523
This kid's a freaking genius.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.548
No, he is, and he's really good at sports.

17:55.550 --> 17:56.758
Oh, that's important.

17:56.760 --> 17:57.591
It is to me.

17:57.593 --> 17:58.900
You know it's like my life.

18:00.090 --> 18:02.988
If only I could get her
to go to dinner with me.

18:02.990 --> 18:04.628
Good luck with that.

18:04.630 --> 18:06.523
So what can you tell me about her?

18:09.290 --> 18:10.893
Speaking of which.

18:15.039 --> 18:16.789
All right, go time.

18:21.023 --> 18:22.750
Hey, Lisa!

18:22.752 --> 18:24.688
It's you again.

18:24.690 --> 18:25.868
Yeah.

18:25.870 --> 18:28.135
I wanted to give you
Holden's cut of the winnings.

18:28.137 --> 18:29.808
Oh, no, please, keep your money.

18:29.810 --> 18:32.778
Seriously, I just, I don't
think it's that educational.

18:32.780 --> 18:34.408
All right, well at least
let me buy you lunch.

18:34.410 --> 18:37.183
Oh, I'm actually in
a hurry, but thank you.

18:37.185 --> 18:38.388
All right, well, how about you let me

18:38.390 --> 18:40.183
buy you dinner sometime next week then?

18:41.020 --> 18:42.858
Come on, just think about it.

18:42.860 --> 18:44.728
Okay, I will think about it.

18:44.730 --> 18:45.561
All right.

18:45.563 --> 18:46.394
Well, David's here.

18:46.396 --> 18:47.227
Really?
You should go talk to him.

18:47.229 --> 18:49.028
Yeah, he'll tell you
what a great guy I am.

18:49.030 --> 18:51.168
Huh, I'm sure he will.

18:51.170 --> 18:52.678
I mean, look at the two of us.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.098
We'd be perfect together.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.838
Young doctor and a hypochondriac.

18:56.840 --> 18:57.671
Come on.

18:57.673 --> 18:59.164
My mother would be so proud.

18:59.166 --> 19:00.766
I'm sure she would.

19:01.938 --> 19:02.769
Lisa.

19:02.771 --> 19:03.602
David!

19:03.604 --> 19:04.435
- Hi.
- How are you?

19:04.437 --> 19:05.785
I'm good, how are you?

19:05.787 --> 19:06.688
I'm good.

19:06.690 --> 19:08.048
How is April?

19:08.050 --> 19:09.468
She's doing good.

19:09.470 --> 19:10.398
I miss her so much.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.043
I know, I'm sorry.

19:13.045 --> 19:16.078
You guys are both such amazing
people, and I love you both.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.688
I know you're gonna work this out.

19:17.690 --> 19:18.521
Promise?

19:18.523 --> 19:21.618
Yes, just hang in there.

19:21.620 --> 19:24.250
Okay, I will talk to you next week.

19:24.252 --> 19:25.129
Yeah, great!

19:25.131 --> 19:25.962
Okay.

19:25.964 --> 19:27.098
I'll get your number from David?

19:27.100 --> 19:27.931
Yeah.

19:27.933 --> 19:29.508
Sounds good.

19:29.510 --> 19:32.749
Well one thing's for sure,
my son sure likes you.

19:32.751 --> 19:33.584
He's a cool kid.

19:35.460 --> 19:36.410
He likes him too.

19:37.780 --> 19:39.648
I don't understand these instructions.

19:39.650 --> 19:42.118
It says identify cables and wires.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.720
Okay, honey, honey, it's okay.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.128
We'll read it again.

19:47.130 --> 19:48.930
Okay, all right.

19:48.932 --> 19:50.140
Don't be hard on yourself.

19:50.142 --> 19:50.973
All right.

19:50.975 --> 19:51.806
We'll get this.

19:51.808 --> 19:54.397
Do not install GFCI receptacle.

19:54.399 --> 19:55.230
Right.

19:55.232 --> 19:56.778
- Okay, so maybe the...
- Hello?

19:56.780 --> 19:57.611
Hi, honey.

19:57.613 --> 19:58.953
Oh, Peaches!

19:59.900 --> 20:01.505
It's great to see you!

20:01.507 --> 20:04.045
Oh, great to see you too.

20:04.047 --> 20:05.847
I've missed you, kid.

20:05.849 --> 20:07.988
I've missed you too.

20:07.990 --> 20:10.633
Okay, I'm gonna put these groceries away.

20:13.330 --> 20:15.798
Oh, honey, don't forget your jacket.

20:15.800 --> 20:16.928
You left it here yesterday.

20:16.930 --> 20:17.988
I put it on the chair.

20:17.990 --> 20:19.240
Okay.

20:19.242 --> 20:20.308
Okay.

20:20.310 --> 20:23.358
Okay, so, sweetheart, I think you need

20:23.360 --> 20:25.844
to maybe turn it the other direction.

20:25.846 --> 20:26.677
You think?

20:26.679 --> 20:27.783
Yeah, well why don't you try it.

20:27.785 --> 20:28.918
All right.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.020
The other direction.

20:33.032 --> 20:33.863
All right, that's good.

20:33.865 --> 20:36.868
All right, so now let's
look at the picture.

20:36.870 --> 20:38.688
Is that the same?

20:38.690 --> 20:39.521
Maybe turn it...

20:39.523 --> 20:41.343
Well, no, the picture's like that.

20:42.409 --> 20:43.898
Peaches!

20:43.900 --> 20:44.733
You're home!

20:45.570 --> 20:47.788
What a surprise!

20:47.790 --> 20:49.168
I've missed you, kid.

20:49.170 --> 20:50.843
I've missed you as well.

20:53.338 --> 20:55.538
You know, why don't...

20:55.540 --> 20:56.998
Why don't you look for
another screwdriver?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.568
Maybe these are the wrong ones.

20:58.570 --> 20:59.858
Why don't you go check your toolbox

20:59.860 --> 21:01.693
and see if you can get a different one?

21:02.810 --> 21:04.298
Is Lisa coming as well?

21:04.300 --> 21:06.601
She should be stopping
by some time this weekend.

21:06.603 --> 21:07.887
Ah, good.

21:17.073 --> 21:18.656
How was your day?

21:19.720 --> 21:20.893
It's getting worse.

21:22.550 --> 21:24.493
He left food on the fire today.

21:25.800 --> 21:29.669
We have to get the
caregiver in more often.

21:29.671 --> 21:30.502
I need help.

21:30.504 --> 21:33.023
It's not a problem, okay?

21:34.110 --> 21:36.158
I want you to be able to
go to the grocery store

21:36.160 --> 21:37.973
and live a normal life.

21:39.410 --> 21:41.693
And don't worry about the money.

21:42.610 --> 21:44.110
I'm gonna take care of it.

21:47.927 --> 21:48.927
Thank you.

21:51.840 --> 21:54.208
I miss my grandson.

21:54.210 --> 21:55.538
And I know she's busy.

21:55.540 --> 21:57.648
I do, I know, but...

21:57.650 --> 21:59.028
You have to make time every now and then

21:59.030 --> 22:01.018
to see your parents, don't you?

22:01.020 --> 22:02.031
Isn't that...

22:02.033 --> 22:04.698
I know, but she's a single mother.

22:04.700 --> 22:06.908
She works all the time.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.660
She barely even gets to see Holden.

22:09.540 --> 22:12.073
She sends her love, and
she misses you guys.

22:14.860 --> 22:17.103
I'm sure she'll stop by this weekend.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.300
That's what you said last weekend.

22:23.990 --> 22:25.278
Maybe we should check on dad, huh?

22:25.280 --> 22:27.018
Yeah, yeah.

22:27.020 --> 22:27.853
Dad?

22:29.990 --> 22:30.821
Good seeing you.

22:30.823 --> 22:32.118
Good seeing you too, honey.

22:32.120 --> 22:33.808
I'm gonna take care of the money, okay?

22:33.810 --> 22:35.690
Don't worry about it.

22:35.692 --> 22:36.723
Please.

22:37.620 --> 22:39.746
Please, don't tell Lisa.

22:39.748 --> 22:40.579
I won't.

22:40.581 --> 22:41.928
I won't say anything.

22:41.930 --> 22:43.511
Okay.

22:43.513 --> 22:44.344
- Bye.
- Bye.

22:44.346 --> 22:45.448
See you tomorrow.

22:45.450 --> 22:46.538
Be careful driving home.

22:46.540 --> 22:48.001
I will.

22:48.003 --> 22:50.368
Are you all finished?

22:50.370 --> 22:51.203
Oh.

22:54.510 --> 22:55.494
Hi.

22:55.496 --> 22:56.395
Hey, good to see you.

22:56.397 --> 22:57.751
Good to see you too.

22:57.753 --> 22:59.078
How are you doing with everything?

22:59.080 --> 22:59.913
Michael!

23:00.832 --> 23:01.848
What's up, buddy?

23:01.850 --> 23:02.738
Lisa will be here in a minute.

23:02.740 --> 23:04.028
Oh, cool, sounds good.

23:04.030 --> 23:04.878
Come sit with us.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.048
You bring your laptop?

23:06.050 --> 23:07.258
Of course.

23:07.260 --> 23:08.923
I got something I gotta show you.

23:13.770 --> 23:14.770
All right.

23:18.970 --> 23:19.801
That.

23:19.803 --> 23:21.788
April, come look!

23:21.790 --> 23:22.890
We're gonna win again!

23:26.740 --> 23:28.388
Double up.

23:28.390 --> 23:31.598
Last week we won $7,000 from one game.

23:31.600 --> 23:32.431
Is that true?

23:32.433 --> 23:33.413
It sure is.

23:34.510 --> 23:38.023
So if I wanted to place
a bet, what would I do?

23:38.910 --> 23:40.538
Well you just tell me
how much you want to make,

23:40.540 --> 23:42.728
and my man here will make it happen.

23:42.730 --> 23:44.818
Mom thinks it's very un-educational.

23:44.820 --> 23:45.651
That's okay.

23:45.653 --> 23:47.173
It's our little secret.

23:50.170 --> 23:51.001
Hey, guys.

23:51.003 --> 23:53.823
I am so sorry I am late.

23:53.825 --> 23:55.058
Ugh!

23:55.060 --> 23:56.798
Got holed up at work.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.328
Hi!

23:58.330 --> 23:59.308
Did you get your homework done?

23:59.310 --> 24:00.328
- Mm-hm.
- Yes?

24:00.330 --> 24:01.306
Good.

24:01.308 --> 24:02.139
Thank you.

24:02.141 --> 24:02.972
No worries.

24:02.974 --> 24:04.478
- For picking him up.
- Of course.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.728
Where did you park your car?

24:05.730 --> 24:07.358
I didn't see it in the driveway.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.728
I sold it.

24:08.730 --> 24:09.561
What?

24:09.563 --> 24:11.278
Yeah, I got a great deal.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.111
April.

24:12.113 --> 24:14.328
You did not even tell me
that you were thinking

24:14.330 --> 24:16.158
about selling your car.

24:16.160 --> 24:17.858
Don't worry about it.

24:17.860 --> 24:20.418
I needed the money, so
I'll get another one.

24:20.420 --> 24:21.828
You guys have fun.

24:21.830 --> 24:22.898
Holden and I are gonna go.

24:22.900 --> 24:23.733
Come on, baby.

24:31.498 --> 24:32.329
Good to see you.

24:32.331 --> 24:33.868
Hi, yes.

24:33.870 --> 24:36.948
Sorry, I got held up at work.

24:36.950 --> 24:38.201
Don't worry about it.

24:38.203 --> 24:39.648
Hey, you look exhausted!

24:39.650 --> 24:41.663
Oh, yeah, thank you.

24:42.620 --> 24:45.278
Tell you what, why don't
we just stay in and relax,

24:45.280 --> 24:47.168
and we could order some sushi?

24:47.170 --> 24:48.001
Really?

24:48.003 --> 24:49.818
That would actually be wonderful.

24:49.820 --> 24:51.888
That is the best thing I've heard all day.

24:51.890 --> 24:52.721
Thank you.

24:52.723 --> 24:54.068
Yeah, cool.

24:54.070 --> 24:55.338
But we're gonna have to do it soon,

24:55.340 --> 24:58.058
because my blood sugar's
starting to drop, so.

24:58.060 --> 24:59.248
Okay.

24:59.250 --> 25:00.108
Yeah.

25:00.110 --> 25:01.584
Sure, I'll grab my phone.

25:01.586 --> 25:04.478
All right, let's do this.

25:04.480 --> 25:05.458
So.

25:05.460 --> 25:06.925
What'd you guys do while I was gone?

25:06.927 --> 25:08.648
Ah, we just played on my laptop.

25:08.650 --> 25:09.481
No!

25:09.483 --> 25:10.981
You didn't make bets in
front of Holden, did you?

25:10.983 --> 25:12.415
He's a genius, you know?

25:12.417 --> 25:13.598
Yeah, I know.

25:13.600 --> 25:17.238
He knows sports better than
anybody that I've ever met.

25:17.240 --> 25:20.354
But I knew how you felt
about it, so we refrained.

25:20.356 --> 25:21.868
Really?

25:21.870 --> 25:23.133
Good kid.

25:23.135 --> 25:23.968
Yeah.

25:25.673 --> 25:27.708
All right, show me.

25:27.710 --> 25:29.228
Okay.

25:29.230 --> 25:30.456
See?

25:30.458 --> 25:32.328
You just got the games,
there's the betting line,

25:32.330 --> 25:34.678
and you can bet whatever you want.

25:34.680 --> 25:36.108
Hm.

25:36.110 --> 25:38.258
Wait, what's that?

25:38.260 --> 25:39.310
Did April make a bet?

25:40.370 --> 25:42.358
Oh yeah, she asked me
to set this up for her.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.278
I think she's gonna start trying it.

25:44.280 --> 25:45.708
What?

25:45.710 --> 25:47.808
God, that's so weird.

25:47.810 --> 25:50.238
I don't know, I think there's
something going on with her.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.128
She made this bet, she sold her car.

25:52.130 --> 25:54.048
She obviously needs money.

25:54.050 --> 25:55.468
She's been going through a lot lately.

25:55.470 --> 25:56.488
Yeah, I know.

25:56.490 --> 25:59.458
I just wish she would take
money when I offer it to her.

25:59.460 --> 26:00.293
It's like...

26:01.500 --> 26:02.818
I have an idea.

26:02.820 --> 26:04.268
She won't take money from me,

26:04.270 --> 26:07.314
but she will take it if
she thinks she won it.

26:07.316 --> 26:08.149
Mm-hm!

26:09.090 --> 26:10.468
Michael, will you please just tell her

26:10.470 --> 26:12.248
she hit it big on one of her bets,

26:12.250 --> 26:14.767
and I'll give you the
money to give to her.

26:16.070 --> 26:17.228
Okay.

26:17.230 --> 26:19.402
If that's what you want
me to do, then I'll do it.

26:19.404 --> 26:20.404
Thank you.

26:22.850 --> 26:25.943
There's actually something else
I want to talk to you about.

26:28.160 --> 26:30.907
Actually, I don't even know
how to say this to you.

26:32.100 --> 26:33.388
What is it?

26:33.390 --> 26:34.923
Is it my blood work?

26:36.330 --> 26:37.163
Yeah.

26:38.090 --> 26:39.273
It is your blood work.

26:41.404 --> 26:42.838
I don't know how to tell you this.

26:42.840 --> 26:43.683
Michael...

26:45.370 --> 26:46.783
You're completely healthy!

26:47.760 --> 26:50.596
Yeah, you have a complete bill of health.

26:50.598 --> 26:51.429
Healthy?

26:51.431 --> 26:54.353
Yes, you're like 100% healthy.

26:57.680 --> 27:00.728
I don't know, I'm gonna
have to get a second opinion.

27:00.730 --> 27:02.888
Well you're like a super-young doctor.

27:02.890 --> 27:03.938
Right, okay.

27:03.940 --> 27:06.358
Well I was thinking about
kissing you tonight,

27:06.360 --> 27:10.003
but I don't know if that's
gonna happen anymore.

27:17.040 --> 27:19.478
Heart rate picking up?

27:19.480 --> 27:20.311
Yeah.

27:21.146 --> 27:22.188
You gonna be okay?

27:22.190 --> 27:23.308
Yeah, I'm good.

27:23.310 --> 27:25.008
Luckily I have a doctor in the house.

27:25.010 --> 27:27.178
You do, a young one though.

27:27.180 --> 27:28.315
Still better than nothing.

27:29.890 --> 27:33.413
Now you're really not
getting kissed.

27:39.447 --> 27:41.865
95 miles per hour, ah!

27:45.490 --> 27:46.558
Hi, sweetie pie!

27:46.560 --> 27:47.693
Everything okay?

27:48.910 --> 27:50.848
Yes, everything is fine.

27:50.850 --> 27:52.668
Can I please have dad's guitar?

27:52.670 --> 27:53.553
Sure, sweetie.

27:55.132 --> 27:58.608
Super ultra beginner strumming,

27:58.610 --> 28:01.093
nice and easy, with lots of patience.

28:16.420 --> 28:17.818
Hi, it's me.

28:17.820 --> 28:20.728
Hello, Steven, are you okay?

28:20.730 --> 28:21.563
How are you?

28:23.710 --> 28:25.257
How is he?

28:25.259 --> 28:26.643
How's he doing?

28:28.730 --> 28:31.418
He has you guitar again.

28:31.420 --> 28:32.978
It's just so awful.

28:32.980 --> 28:36.213
First he lost Natalie, and he's lost you.

28:40.580 --> 28:42.458
He's watching videos on the internet.

28:42.460 --> 28:45.060
He's trying to teach himself
how to play the guitar.

28:46.260 --> 28:49.123
He misses you so much, Steven.

28:51.580 --> 28:53.148
Okay.

28:53.150 --> 28:54.098
I, uh...

28:54.100 --> 28:55.250
I have to go.

29:53.140 --> 29:55.733
I only did what you asked me to do.

30:03.705 --> 30:04.538
I'm sorry.

30:08.704 --> 30:10.287
What have I done?

30:11.373 --> 30:13.323
I miss him so much.

30:14.800 --> 30:17.628
Good morning, my beautiful princess.

30:17.630 --> 30:19.613
Good morning, my love.

30:20.920 --> 30:21.928
Really?

30:22.941 --> 30:23.774
Love?

30:25.898 --> 30:27.598
Define love.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.108
What?

30:29.110 --> 30:30.910
It's not like you to be so insecure.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.040
Seriously.

30:36.910 --> 30:39.093
Define true love.

30:44.910 --> 30:46.343
Love is...

30:47.580 --> 30:50.378
Okay, so if the universe lined up

30:50.380 --> 30:54.768
all the men in the world,
and I had to choose,

30:54.770 --> 30:58.073
every single morning I'd choose one man.

30:59.270 --> 31:02.630
Every single morning, I would choose you

31:04.031 --> 31:06.549
without a second thought.

31:06.551 --> 31:11.047
You are the most amazing
woman I've ever seen in my life.

31:12.594 --> 31:14.213
You always knock me off my feet.

31:17.439 --> 31:20.089
And I had a little production
planned for us tonight,

31:20.974 --> 31:23.258
but because of what you've said,

31:23.260 --> 31:25.810
I've changed my mind and
I'm gonna do it right now.

31:28.540 --> 31:29.703
Hold on one second.

31:36.170 --> 31:37.383
Oh my god!

31:38.220 --> 31:39.533
Will you marry me?

31:41.483 --> 31:43.203
Yes, yes, yes!

31:46.250 --> 31:48.159
I guess we're not going to work today.

31:50.028 --> 31:52.412
I don't think so.

31:52.414 --> 31:55.081
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

31:59.630 --> 32:00.748
Wait, we gotta try this one first.

32:00.750 --> 32:03.690
Oh, yes, make sure it fits.

32:05.531 --> 32:06.531
There we go.

32:09.597 --> 32:11.622
What do you think?

32:11.624 --> 32:13.707
I think you're my wife.

32:19.362 --> 32:20.279
I love you.

32:51.780 --> 32:53.030
There you are!

32:53.960 --> 32:54.793
Sharon.

32:57.070 --> 32:59.378
I've decided to have
lunch with you today.

32:59.380 --> 33:01.187
It's tuna!

33:01.189 --> 33:02.189
You want it?

33:03.346 --> 33:04.179
Sure.

33:15.824 --> 33:16.657
Are...

33:18.382 --> 33:19.583
Are you in a hurry?

33:21.760 --> 33:22.593
No.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.243
Is there something I can help you with?

33:28.512 --> 33:29.345
Yeah.

34:09.719 --> 34:10.553
There he is!

34:11.600 --> 34:12.793
With the red backpack!

34:17.590 --> 34:18.623
His name is Adam.

34:21.800 --> 34:22.632
Here.

34:23.498 --> 34:24.973
I want you to give him this guitar.

34:25.904 --> 34:26.737
Okay.

34:46.449 --> 34:47.626
Hi, Adam.

34:47.628 --> 34:49.237
Hi.

34:49.239 --> 34:51.228
I know you problem don't know me,

34:51.230 --> 34:53.068
but I have something very special

34:53.070 --> 34:55.483
from someone who loves you very much.

34:59.484 --> 35:00.758
Is it from my dad?

35:00.760 --> 35:02.078
Can I see him?

35:02.080 --> 35:02.943
I miss him.

35:04.340 --> 35:06.907
I'm sure you're gonna see him soon.

35:06.909 --> 35:07.742
What?

35:09.300 --> 35:10.133
Listen.

35:11.820 --> 35:13.908
I know you probably shouldn't
be talking to strangers,

35:13.910 --> 35:15.603
so take it and go straight home.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.178
So.

35:31.180 --> 35:32.180
You have a kid, huh?

35:34.050 --> 35:36.138
Okay, lay it on me.

35:36.140 --> 35:38.648
What, is mom complaining about me again?

35:38.650 --> 35:41.459
No, she just wants to see you.

35:41.461 --> 35:43.319
You know, her doctor.

35:45.254 --> 35:46.087
I know.

35:47.332 --> 35:49.567
I don't know, maybe we could
go visit her next weekend.

35:49.569 --> 35:50.768
Mm-hm.

35:50.770 --> 35:51.601
Yeah.

35:51.603 --> 35:54.858
Well, no matter what I am, you
will always be her favorite.

35:54.860 --> 35:57.218
Oh, no, they're so proud of you.

35:57.220 --> 35:59.043
Mom always calls you wonder woman.

36:01.541 --> 36:02.858
I have to agree.

36:02.860 --> 36:05.958
I mean, I can barely get through the day,

36:05.960 --> 36:09.131
and I don't have children.

36:09.133 --> 36:10.558
I know, I felt like there's been

36:10.560 --> 36:12.716
something going on with you.

36:12.718 --> 36:15.645
You just, you haven't
been yourself lately.

36:15.647 --> 36:16.480
You look sad.

36:17.636 --> 36:22.636
Yeah.

36:22.810 --> 36:25.303
There's something that I've
been meaning to tell you.

36:29.050 --> 36:30.903
Last time when I went to the doctors,

36:30.905 --> 36:33.593
they told me that, because
of the miscarriage...

36:37.956 --> 36:39.988
I can't have kids.

36:39.990 --> 36:41.098
What?

36:41.100 --> 36:42.416
Are you sure?

36:42.418 --> 36:43.249
I mean, did you get a second opinion.

36:43.251 --> 36:44.084
Of course.

36:45.996 --> 36:47.996
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

36:50.707 --> 36:51.540
I'm sorry.

36:53.972 --> 36:56.498
What did David say when you told him?

36:56.500 --> 36:58.003
David wanted kids.

37:00.524 --> 37:02.524
I wanted that for David.

37:07.083 --> 37:08.383
I couldn't tell him.

37:09.470 --> 37:10.423
April!

37:11.940 --> 37:14.940
I hate to tell you this, but
you have to tell him the truth.

37:16.580 --> 37:18.908
Promise me that you will!

37:18.910 --> 37:20.608
I mean, I'm not trying
to tell you what to do,

37:20.610 --> 37:22.238
but trust me on this one.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.463
He deserves to know.

37:24.770 --> 37:26.813
Honey, this did not just happen to you.

37:27.720 --> 37:29.070
It happened to both of you.

37:34.296 --> 37:35.129
Okay.

37:40.587 --> 37:41.868
I know what you're thinking,

37:41.870 --> 37:44.307
but it's more complicated than that.

37:46.078 --> 37:47.328
He's better off this way.

37:53.720 --> 37:58.257
Ever since I got back
from Afghanistan, my...

38:01.813 --> 38:06.813
My mind has been wrestling
with the things that I've seen.

38:09.010 --> 38:10.893
And I can be difficult to live with.

38:16.950 --> 38:21.623
And a few months ago, Natalie
was diagnosed with cancer.

38:25.090 --> 38:26.543
I lost the will to live.

38:29.990 --> 38:30.821
I wish it wasn't true,

38:30.823 --> 38:33.170
but he's better off with his grandparents.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.483
I believe every problem can be solved.

38:38.930 --> 38:40.030
Whenever you're ready,

38:41.320 --> 38:43.358
please come and visit me at my office.

38:43.360 --> 38:44.973
I could really use your help.

38:53.710 --> 38:54.541
I know.

38:54.543 --> 38:57.548
Unless we have more pieces
that have gone into the abyss.

38:57.550 --> 38:58.718
Yeah.

39:00.670 --> 39:01.501
I give up.

39:01.503 --> 39:02.678
You give up?

39:02.680 --> 39:04.528
- It doesn't look like that.
- We just started!

39:04.530 --> 39:06.538
We're off to a bad start.

39:06.540 --> 39:07.898
Hi, guys.

39:07.900 --> 39:08.731
Hi, April.

39:08.733 --> 39:10.146
Oh, hey, April.

39:15.270 --> 39:16.470
Did you talk to David?

39:18.670 --> 39:20.078
No.

39:20.080 --> 39:21.123
April!

39:22.160 --> 39:23.018
Okay, that's it.

39:23.020 --> 39:24.528
You are coming with me right now.

39:24.530 --> 39:25.758
Why?

39:25.760 --> 39:27.228
We are not coming back to this house

39:27.230 --> 39:28.693
until you tell him the truth.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.328
Yes!

39:31.330 --> 39:32.668
Michael?

39:32.670 --> 39:35.648
Do you mind watching
Holden for an hour or so?

39:35.650 --> 39:38.868
Yeah, sure, this'll take
us at least an hour to build.

39:38.870 --> 39:40.508
Thank you.

39:40.510 --> 39:42.388
Okay, let's go!

39:42.390 --> 39:43.470
April, yes!

39:46.180 --> 39:47.013
I give up.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.298
So what else do you want to do?

39:50.300 --> 39:51.318
I'll get the laptop.

39:51.320 --> 39:52.898
Ah, not so fast.

39:52.900 --> 39:54.718
I got a better idea.

39:54.720 --> 39:57.708
Now, have you thought about
becoming a doctor like your mom?

39:57.710 --> 39:59.198
I haven't decided yet.

39:59.200 --> 40:01.099
Well can I get you to check my pulse?

40:01.101 --> 40:02.425
No, I don't really know how.

40:02.427 --> 40:03.498
Ah, it's super easy.

40:03.500 --> 40:04.455
I'll teach you.

40:04.457 --> 40:06.758
All right, take your
finger, put 'em right there.

40:06.760 --> 40:07.628
You're gonna hit that main artery,

40:07.630 --> 40:09.248
and you're gonna feel my heartbeat.

40:09.250 --> 40:10.500
Now, just the fingertips.

40:11.515 --> 40:12.346
Now, can you feel it?

40:12.348 --> 40:13.179
Yeah.

40:13.181 --> 40:17.038
Okay, now, I'm gonna have
you count that for 15 seconds.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.434
And go.

40:25.640 --> 40:27.518
All right, what'd you come up with?

40:27.520 --> 40:28.428
16.

40:28.430 --> 40:29.261
Okay.

40:29.263 --> 40:30.773
Now you multiply that times four.

40:32.205 --> 40:33.538
64.

40:33.540 --> 40:34.373
64.

40:36.690 --> 40:38.773
See, I knew that this thing was off.

40:40.460 --> 40:41.328
Annoying.

40:41.330 --> 40:43.118
We should do it again.

40:43.120 --> 40:45.558
Mike, if you ever want me
to make you a hot chocolate,

40:45.560 --> 40:48.128
I know how to make the best
hot chocolate in the world.

40:48.130 --> 40:49.498
Well do you have almond milk?

40:49.500 --> 40:51.058
'Cause I can't have dairy.

40:51.060 --> 40:52.773
Yes, I think we do.

40:54.395 --> 40:55.395
All right.

40:56.710 --> 40:57.853
Okay, ready?

40:58.750 --> 41:00.558
Go talk to him.

41:00.560 --> 41:01.683
He deserves to know.

41:02.740 --> 41:03.773
You can do this.

41:05.161 --> 41:05.994
Okay?

41:07.703 --> 41:08.883
I love you, April.

41:14.293 --> 41:15.468
Mm, here, taste it.

41:15.470 --> 41:16.858
Not after you drank out of it!

41:16.860 --> 41:18.398
No freaking way!

41:18.400 --> 41:19.668
Come on, drink it!

41:19.670 --> 41:22.228
My bacteria are super friendly.

41:22.230 --> 41:25.798
You know I like you, kid, but
I don't like you that much.

41:25.800 --> 41:26.903
Drink it!

41:29.060 --> 41:29.893
Fine.

41:34.270 --> 41:36.287
Okay, you got me, it's good.

41:44.621 --> 41:45.767
it's a little gross though.

41:51.739 --> 41:52.570
May I help you?

41:52.572 --> 41:53.403
Hi.

41:53.405 --> 41:55.818
Yeah, does Sharon work here?

41:55.820 --> 41:57.098
Here, come on in.

41:57.100 --> 41:58.928
Take any seat you'd like.

41:58.930 --> 41:59.763
Cool, yeah.

42:05.710 --> 42:06.793
So...

42:07.690 --> 42:11.208
I have this friend who might
be able to help you out.

42:11.210 --> 42:13.023
His name is James Marver.

42:13.980 --> 42:15.519
We served together in Afghanistan.

42:15.521 --> 42:18.788
I heard he's a pretty
successful businessman,

42:18.790 --> 42:21.298
and he's dabbled in stocks.

42:21.300 --> 42:24.893
I don't have his number, but
we might be able to find it.

42:26.064 --> 42:27.528
M-A-R-V-E-R, right?

42:27.530 --> 42:28.363
Yeah.

42:32.660 --> 42:33.493
Is that him?

42:36.930 --> 42:38.837
Yeah, that's him.

42:40.510 --> 42:41.688
Look.

42:41.690 --> 42:43.128
I know you're the one that told Michael

42:43.130 --> 42:44.698
to give me the money, okay?

42:44.700 --> 42:45.913
And I'm not taking it.

42:47.700 --> 42:48.828
April!

42:48.830 --> 42:49.878
I'm just trying to help you.

42:49.880 --> 42:50.711
I know.

42:50.713 --> 42:52.608
And I love you so much.

42:52.610 --> 42:54.683
And I'm so lucky to have you in my life.

42:56.532 --> 42:57.908
You know, I'm not saying
things aren't hard.

42:57.910 --> 42:59.203
I want my husband back.

43:00.308 --> 43:02.178
I know, sweetie.

43:02.180 --> 43:03.583
I love you.

43:03.585 --> 43:06.080
- Oh, honey, I love you too.
- Seriously, take this.

43:07.349 --> 43:08.180
Okay?

43:08.182 --> 43:09.548
Okay.

43:09.550 --> 43:10.550
I'm gonna be okay.

43:18.870 --> 43:20.043
Steven Leary.

43:20.923 --> 43:22.173
James Marver.

43:25.003 --> 43:26.730
God, it's good to see you, man.

43:28.130 --> 43:29.318
You know, I've been trying to reach out.

43:29.320 --> 43:31.218
You're impossible to find.

43:31.220 --> 43:32.053
Yeah.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.568
We need to catch up.

43:34.570 --> 43:38.018
But first, this is Sharon Rogan.

43:38.020 --> 43:39.868
She made this whole thing happen.

43:39.870 --> 43:40.701
Hi.

43:40.703 --> 43:41.842
Hi, pleasure to meet you, Sharon.

43:41.844 --> 43:43.078
Pleasure to meet you.

43:43.080 --> 43:45.458
Thank you for making this all happen.

43:45.460 --> 43:46.291
Thank you.

43:46.293 --> 43:47.126
It almost didn't.

43:48.420 --> 43:49.523
Please, have a seat.

43:51.734 --> 43:52.968
Okay.

43:52.970 --> 43:53.803
This is it?

43:54.810 --> 43:56.358
So I looked everything over,

43:56.360 --> 43:59.968
and apparently your
products are very unique,

43:59.970 --> 44:02.698
and you're stepping
into an untapped market.

44:02.700 --> 44:06.908
I mean, I'd say you're lucky
that contract fell through.

44:06.910 --> 44:07.878
You really should be with someone

44:07.880 --> 44:09.580
who's gonna give you full control.

44:10.460 --> 44:13.388
Now, Great Foods Inc. recently dropped

44:13.390 --> 44:15.098
their fresh produce market,

44:15.100 --> 44:17.653
and they're looking for
someone with zero competition.

44:19.720 --> 44:22.188
The CEO and I are already
in business together,

44:22.190 --> 44:25.283
so I think if we show him this plan,

44:26.360 --> 44:29.413
within six weeks you'll pick
up right where you left off.

44:30.409 --> 44:33.843
I don't want to sound
pathetic, but you're my hero!

44:35.500 --> 44:36.553
I'm here to stay.

44:40.040 --> 44:41.290
How about refills, huh?

44:42.250 --> 44:43.083
Coffee.

44:44.110 --> 44:45.328
How do you take it?

44:45.330 --> 44:46.443
Cream, sugar?

44:48.478 --> 44:49.618
Yeah.

44:49.620 --> 44:51.878
Leary, why don't we grab some dinner

44:51.880 --> 44:53.878
and maybe head back to my place?

44:53.880 --> 44:56.368
We got a lot of catching up to do.

44:56.370 --> 44:57.948
Yeah.

44:57.950 --> 44:58.783
Cool.

45:02.950 --> 45:04.048
Thank you.

45:04.050 --> 45:06.483
Of course, yes, this is gonna be great.

45:15.190 --> 45:16.848
All right!

45:16.850 --> 45:18.750
You know what, I probably shouldn't.

45:19.750 --> 45:20.583
Thank you.

45:22.300 --> 45:23.133
Oh.

45:25.046 --> 45:26.523
You know what, you're right.

45:26.525 --> 45:27.958
Let's stick to water, right?

45:27.960 --> 45:29.558
Keep the minds clear.

45:29.560 --> 45:30.438
I love it.

45:30.440 --> 45:31.271
Thank you.

45:31.273 --> 45:32.758
I will be right back.

45:32.760 --> 45:33.593
Perfect.

45:46.070 --> 45:47.088
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

45:47.090 --> 45:48.788
Hey, to you, man.

45:48.790 --> 45:50.158
You must doing all right for yourself.

45:50.160 --> 45:52.338
This is quite a place you've got here.

45:52.340 --> 45:54.713
And tell me what's
been going on with you.

45:55.570 --> 45:57.103
Tell me more about your kid.

46:01.240 --> 46:02.783
He is so talented.

46:04.240 --> 46:05.868
He just took up the guitar,

46:05.870 --> 46:06.951
and he's teaching himself how to play.

46:06.953 --> 46:08.958
He's a chip off the old block.

46:08.960 --> 46:09.793
He's so smart.

46:11.010 --> 46:12.501
Good, man.

46:12.503 --> 46:13.553
Good for you.

46:19.780 --> 46:22.330
Listen, I'm sorry again to
hear about Natalie, man.

46:24.171 --> 46:25.023
It's just awful.

46:26.850 --> 46:28.553
She seemed like such a great girl.

46:29.410 --> 46:31.708
I mean, based on all those video chats

46:31.710 --> 46:33.881
you used to have back
at the base, remember?

46:35.018 --> 46:37.248
Yeah.

46:37.250 --> 46:39.663
She used to call every weekend.

46:42.270 --> 46:43.103
What a girl.

46:48.470 --> 46:51.023
It's gotta be pretty tough
raising that kid on your own.

46:51.860 --> 46:52.933
He's got a great dad.

46:55.560 --> 46:57.123
Well, you know,

46:58.410 --> 47:02.463
Rita, Natalie's mom actually has him...

47:03.990 --> 47:05.133
a lot of the time.

47:06.520 --> 47:09.173
And that makes it easier.

47:10.930 --> 47:11.763
Yeah.

47:12.640 --> 47:14.053
Oh, yeah, that's awesome.

47:15.890 --> 47:16.723
Good.

47:17.760 --> 47:18.593
Good, good.

47:20.160 --> 47:22.128
So, uh...

47:22.130 --> 47:25.228
Sharon said she could use
you in the office tomorrow.

47:25.230 --> 47:26.133
That's cool.

47:31.216 --> 47:32.878
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:32.880 --> 47:34.657
You never had good taste in clothes.

47:35.492 --> 47:36.598
Ever.

47:36.600 --> 47:38.038
In this history of knowing you.

47:39.225 --> 47:41.298
Shut up!

47:41.300 --> 47:42.750
No worries, man, I got you.

47:43.910 --> 47:46.382
Yeah, let's take a
walk, let's take a walk.

47:46.384 --> 47:48.068
Okay.

47:48.070 --> 47:49.088
Need a refill?

47:49.090 --> 47:50.540
Let's top her off.

47:52.940 --> 47:54.588
Now when we clothes that
deal, we'll go shopping.

47:54.590 --> 47:57.283
But for now, I want you
to have a few things.

47:59.330 --> 48:00.333
All right.

48:08.190 --> 48:10.027
Either of these look good?

48:16.860 --> 48:18.243
Thank you so much.

48:20.076 --> 48:21.526
Boy, it's so good to see you.

48:22.798 --> 48:24.765
Of course, man.

48:24.767 --> 48:25.600
Of course.

48:28.307 --> 48:30.183
You do need to do one thing for me.

48:32.632 --> 48:35.588
I mean, I thought you liked the beard.

48:35.590 --> 48:36.421
No, I do.

48:36.423 --> 48:37.256
Distinguished.

48:38.670 --> 48:40.273
No, I like it man, just...

48:42.347 --> 48:44.423
I'm messing with you, dude, come on.

48:45.329 --> 48:47.450
Thank you, thank you.

48:49.440 --> 48:50.273
Fresh start.

48:53.010 --> 48:53.843
Fresh start.

49:04.990 --> 49:05.823
Sharon.

49:07.950 --> 49:09.548
Steven?

49:09.550 --> 49:10.533
Is that really you?

49:11.950 --> 49:13.750
That's the man underneath the beard?

49:16.556 --> 49:17.455
Wow, this is...

49:17.457 --> 49:18.773
You're all cleaned up!

49:21.890 --> 49:22.721
Right?

49:22.723 --> 49:24.180
How good does he look?

49:24.182 --> 49:25.158
Yeah?

49:25.160 --> 49:25.991
Pretty snazzy?

49:25.993 --> 49:26.824
Really?

49:26.826 --> 49:28.087
- It's okay, it works?
- You look amazing!

49:28.089 --> 49:28.920
Right?

49:28.922 --> 49:29.755
Wow, Steven!

49:30.680 --> 49:31.833
Looking sharp.

49:33.200 --> 49:34.888
Quite a stud we have here on our team.

49:34.890 --> 49:36.753
Come on, let's get back to work.

49:37.690 --> 49:39.040
Let's get down to business.

49:41.130 --> 49:42.308
I'm getting used to it.

49:42.310 --> 49:43.141
It's good.

49:43.143 --> 49:43.974
You're very clean cut.

49:43.976 --> 49:45.035
It's a great image for you.

49:45.037 --> 49:47.418
Yeah, you think it'll suit the company?

49:47.420 --> 49:49.058
It's exactly...

49:49.060 --> 49:50.653
That's what we're going for.

49:51.680 --> 49:53.596
Fresh and original.

49:58.090 --> 49:59.633
How did you know where to find me?

50:05.447 --> 50:06.614
You know me.

50:08.260 --> 50:09.353
I've got my ways.

50:17.440 --> 50:18.623
I can't let you go.

50:24.135 --> 50:27.478
If we end this, then I'll be staying young

50:27.480 --> 50:30.680
forever in your mind,
and I don't want that.

50:32.070 --> 50:33.577
I want to grow old with you.

50:36.695 --> 50:38.295
I want to create our own family.

50:42.448 --> 50:44.668
I don't care if we can't
have our own children.

50:44.670 --> 50:45.923
We can adopt some.

50:49.180 --> 50:50.828
Do you know how many kids out there

50:50.830 --> 50:52.580
would love to have you as a mother?

50:56.570 --> 50:59.370
You're in my family forever,
and I'm not letting you go.

51:03.995 --> 51:05.245
Come back home.

51:09.890 --> 51:11.973
Of course you are my family!

51:45.510 --> 51:46.838
May I come in?

51:46.840 --> 51:48.358
Yeah, sure.

51:48.360 --> 51:49.193
Hi.

51:50.990 --> 51:51.903
What's the matter?

51:52.848 --> 51:55.100
Um...

51:55.102 --> 51:57.848
Something wrong?

51:57.850 --> 51:59.673
Yeah, I have something to tell you.

52:01.100 --> 52:02.278
Okay.

52:02.280 --> 52:03.113
All right.

52:04.280 --> 52:07.198
Well, you know how I said that our plan

52:07.200 --> 52:09.948
would take about six weeks to unfold?

52:09.950 --> 52:10.943
Mm-hm.

52:14.980 --> 52:16.030
It's happening now.

52:18.610 --> 52:19.960
You mean as in right now?

52:21.200 --> 52:22.133
As in right now?

52:23.450 --> 52:26.043
Oh my god, James, this is unbelievable!

52:27.800 --> 52:29.403
You're a genius!

52:29.405 --> 52:32.028
No, no, no, your product
did all the talking.

52:32.030 --> 52:33.373
Wow, I can't...

52:34.540 --> 52:36.988
I am just astounded.

52:36.990 --> 52:37.940
I can't believe it.

52:41.590 --> 52:44.578
Before you head out, I was wondering if

52:44.580 --> 52:46.923
you would consider being
my business partner.

52:50.150 --> 52:52.178
I don't have to consider.

52:52.180 --> 52:53.780
I will be your business partner.

52:56.250 --> 52:59.303
And I want you to consider...

53:00.160 --> 53:01.360
going to dinner with me.

53:05.440 --> 53:08.143
I don't have to consider it.

53:09.901 --> 53:11.251
I'll go to dinner with you.

53:13.270 --> 53:14.420
Pick you up at eight?

53:15.850 --> 53:16.907
- Tonight?
- Mm-hm.

53:18.690 --> 53:19.523
Sure.

53:20.360 --> 53:21.193
Great.

53:36.557 --> 53:39.923
That man
sitting on the bench is me.

53:41.960 --> 53:43.223
I chose to be here.

53:45.280 --> 53:48.643
Every single morning, I choose to be here.

53:51.040 --> 53:52.813
I've lost all my drive.

53:57.523 --> 53:59.856
I want to tell you a secret.

54:01.270 --> 54:02.733
None of this really happened.

54:04.690 --> 54:08.403
True, all is foreseen, and
freedom of choice is given.

54:09.260 --> 54:10.748
We have the freedom of choice

54:10.750 --> 54:14.208
and the opportunity to decide,
but what are the chances

54:14.210 --> 54:16.410
that each of us will
leave our comfort zone?

54:18.680 --> 54:20.630
Sharon never really stopped next to me.

54:21.690 --> 54:24.578
She was too busy feeling
sorry for herself.

54:24.580 --> 54:27.608
Michael, as a hypochondriac,
is too self-centered

54:27.610 --> 54:29.560
to let someone dependent into his life.

54:31.370 --> 54:32.878
April never got the courage

54:32.880 --> 54:34.923
to tell her sister that she needs help.

54:36.810 --> 54:37.733
So, yes.

54:39.250 --> 54:42.893
We can decide to a certain
degree how our life will look.

54:45.340 --> 54:48.983
So from now on, pay attention
to the next choice you make,

54:50.000 --> 54:52.150
because you never know
where it might lead.
