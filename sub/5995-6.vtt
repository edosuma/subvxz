00:01.102 --> 00:02.570
Previously
 on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:02.602 --> 00:04.772
This is Valencia. My girlfriend.
Hi.

00:04.805 --> 00:07.608
And exhale on an "ah..."
 Hey, do you want to go grab,

00:07.641 --> 00:09.810
like, a coffee with me?
Why would you
want to do that?

00:09.843 --> 00:11.512
PAULA: Look, I get what
 you're doing with this girl.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.814
You befriend the enemy and you
get more face time with Josh.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.517
I'm so glad you moved here,
Becks.

00:16.550 --> 00:17.751
I don't know
what you're trying to do,

00:17.785 --> 00:20.121
or why you pretended
to be my friend,

00:20.154 --> 00:21.422
but stay away from me

00:21.455 --> 00:23.757
and my Josh.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.126
I am attracted to you.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.461
Very,

00:27.495 --> 00:28.796
very attracted to you.

00:31.165 --> 00:33.767
So he said "attracted,"

00:33.801 --> 00:35.469
but then he paused,

00:35.503 --> 00:37.471
and he said "very attracted."

00:37.505 --> 00:39.540
You mentioned that.
Okay, I mentioned it

00:39.573 --> 00:41.209
because it's the "very,"
all right?

00:41.242 --> 00:42.443
That's the wild card.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.678
"Very" is a very important word
in this, right?

00:44.712 --> 00:46.414
Think about it.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.082
You guys have a drink
called Very Berry Blast.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.450
I mean... I'm assuming

00:49.483 --> 00:51.552
that the "very"
means something. Right?

00:51.585 --> 00:52.853
Uh, we don't name 'em.
They just come from corporate.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.455
Okay, but that's-that's
just beside...

00:54.488 --> 00:56.257
beside the point.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.525
Maybe Josh was just
trying to be nice,

00:57.558 --> 00:58.559
like kind of...

00:58.592 --> 00:59.827
BOTH:
...blowing you off?

00:59.860 --> 01:01.729
What?

01:01.762 --> 01:03.164
No, no.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.432
Come on-- no.

01:04.465 --> 01:05.498
You do talk
about him a lot.

01:06.634 --> 01:07.568
What is the history
with you two?

01:07.601 --> 01:11.505
* I was working hard
at a New York job *

01:11.539 --> 01:13.307
* Making dough
but it made me blue *

01:13.341 --> 01:14.708
* One day I was crying a lot

01:14.742 --> 01:16.277
* And so I decided to move

01:16.310 --> 01:17.745
* To West Covina, California

01:17.778 --> 01:19.247
* Brand-new pals
and new career *

01:19.280 --> 01:21.482
* It happens to be
where Josh lives *

01:21.515 --> 01:23.884
* But that's not why I'm here

01:23.917 --> 01:26.187
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *
What? No, I'm not.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.655
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

01:27.688 --> 01:29.190
That's a sexist term.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.524
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

01:30.558 --> 01:31.559
Can you guys stop singing
for just a second?

01:31.592 --> 01:34.295
* She's so broken inside *

01:34.328 --> 01:35.563
The situation's a lot more
nuanced than that.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.565
* C-R-A-Z-Y *

01:37.598 --> 01:39.267
Okay! We get it!

01:39.300 --> 01:40.734
* Crazy ex-girlfriend. *

01:40.768 --> 01:43.304
Look, maybe the reason
I haven't heard from Josh

01:43.337 --> 01:44.505
is what he said.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.140
It's that he's very
attracted to me.

01:46.174 --> 01:47.675
You know, it's like...

01:47.708 --> 01:49.310
like, even if our arms brush,

01:49.343 --> 01:50.544
he gets a little tingle
down there.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.781
Hi, Becks!
(growling)

01:53.814 --> 01:55.216
Oh...

01:55.249 --> 01:56.617
(laughing):
Hey, hey, man.

01:56.650 --> 01:57.851
Wow, I haven't

01:57.885 --> 02:00.821
seen you, uh, in what,
four days?

02:00.854 --> 02:02.456
Yeah, I'm very sorry.

02:02.490 --> 02:03.624
Very?

02:03.657 --> 02:05.626
I've been very M.I.A.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.261
With the holidays,
I'm very slammed.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.929
There is very much
traffic today.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.464
(laughs) That's funny.

02:10.497 --> 02:12.266
So "very" is just
your go-to adverb.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.267
That's...

02:13.301 --> 02:14.568
Uh... uh, nothing.

02:14.602 --> 02:15.936
So you were saying?

02:15.969 --> 02:17.838
Yeah, we host Thanksgiving
at our house

02:17.871 --> 02:20.574
and we got cousins and aunts
and uncles pouring in

02:20.608 --> 02:23.544
from Temecula,
Glendale, San Mateo...

02:23.577 --> 02:25.279
Oh, wow.
Oh, Rancho
Cucamonga,

02:25.313 --> 02:27.581
Stockton, Pismo Beach,

02:27.615 --> 02:28.682
Solvang, Victorville...

02:28.716 --> 02:30.318
How about you?

02:30.351 --> 02:32.320
Well, I'm just gonna...
I forgot the M's.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.455
Uh, Modesto, Monrovia,

02:34.488 --> 02:36.690
Mendocino, and that's it.

02:37.725 --> 02:39.227
What are you doing
for Thanksgiving?

02:39.260 --> 02:41.629
Oh, bleh....

02:41.662 --> 02:44.465
I just go to the East Coast,
to Scarsdale with my mom

02:44.498 --> 02:45.899
and we watch
the World Dog Awards.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.601
Oh! And?

02:47.635 --> 02:49.337
We just roll some Craisins
in turkey slices,

02:49.370 --> 02:50.571
make little logs,

02:50.604 --> 02:52.706
and body-shame some puppies.
Cool!

02:52.740 --> 02:53.941
Most important thing, I guess,

02:53.974 --> 02:55.409
is that you'll be with family.

02:55.443 --> 02:56.644
You know, where you belong.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.646
Yeah.

02:58.679 --> 02:59.980
Yeah, where I...

03:00.013 --> 03:01.549
where I belong.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.952
And I put the boba on
the side for Aunt Dhori.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.555
We know she likes to pop 'em
with her hand.
Thanks, guys.

03:07.588 --> 03:08.956
Have the best Thanksgiving,
Becks.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.391
Give your mother my very best.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.659
See you guys!

03:11.692 --> 03:12.726
Have a good one.
Peace!

03:12.760 --> 03:15.729
Very peace!

03:15.763 --> 03:17.698
(baby coos)

03:17.731 --> 03:18.999
MAN:
Okay, everybody ready?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.834
Say "cheese."
ALL: Cheese.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.270
That's good.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.837
(indistinct chatter)

03:23.871 --> 03:25.673
REBECCA:
 Everyone belongs
 somewhere but me.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.241
That's silly, honey.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.809
You've got family
back home in New York.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.511
I mean, not really.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.746
My dad bailed,
my mom's a misery,

03:32.780 --> 03:35.383
I ate my twin
in the womb.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.551
I really don't want
to go home for the holiday.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.687
It's the last place
I want to be.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.255
Like I said,
you are more than welcome

03:41.289 --> 03:43.257
to my apocalypse
of a Thanksgiving.

03:43.291 --> 03:44.825
Yeah...
I mean, pull up a chair

03:44.858 --> 03:46.627
and enjoy Scott's racist uncle.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.362
You ate your twin?

03:48.396 --> 03:50.298
I mean, medically speaking,
I didn't "eat" it,

03:50.331 --> 03:52.966
I just metabolized
its body parts for my own use.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.637
Why don't you ask Josh
if you can go

03:56.670 --> 03:57.838
to his house for Thanksgiving?

03:57.871 --> 03:59.707
He said he's
"very attracted" to you,

03:59.740 --> 04:01.542
and we know
what that means.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.810
Oh, God, don't even
get me started.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.345
I don't even know
what that means anymore.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.613
I do.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.348
A guy says
something like that,

04:07.381 --> 04:08.682
it means his
current relationship

04:08.716 --> 04:09.917
is about ready
to bite the dust.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.652
He's putting out feelers.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.288
If you could go to his house
for the holiday...

04:14.322 --> 04:15.823
(sighs)

04:15.856 --> 04:17.991
I mean, would I like
to go to the Chans'?

04:18.024 --> 04:20.827
Would I like to be surrounded

04:20.861 --> 04:24.865
by the unconditional love
of a hundred Filipinos?

04:24.898 --> 04:26.667
Of course I would.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.801
Tell us the story!

04:27.835 --> 04:29.837
The library book story!
Again?

04:29.870 --> 04:31.872
Well, no, I couldn't possibly.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.941
(chanting):
Library book story!

04:33.974 --> 04:35.876
Library book story!

04:35.909 --> 04:39.813
Library book story!
Library book story!

04:39.847 --> 04:42.015
Please, Miss Rebecca,
just one more time.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.984
The library book story.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.820
But you know it by heart by now.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.657
Well, all right.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.525
But if Josh was
going to invite me,

04:51.559 --> 04:52.860
he would've asked and he didn't,

04:52.893 --> 04:54.495
so just drop it.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.564
Why do you always
give up so easily?

04:56.597 --> 04:59.367
Do you think Angelina went
into Mr. & Mrs. Smith

04:59.400 --> 05:01.034
with that kind of attitude?

05:01.068 --> 05:02.636
If she had, no Shiloh,

05:02.670 --> 05:03.871
no Maddox, no Vivienne...

05:03.904 --> 05:05.873
Who do you think
belongs next to him

05:05.906 --> 05:08.476
and that turkey on Thursday?

05:08.509 --> 05:10.077
You or Venezuela?

05:10.110 --> 05:13.514
You know what? Thanksgiving is
a beautiful family holiday.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.416
Not gonna let you ruin it
with your scheming.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.485
Okay, okay...
Let's put it this way.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.353
Say a giant boulder
ran over Josh's girlfriend

05:19.387 --> 05:21.121
and she was out of the picture.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.756
How would you feel?

05:22.790 --> 05:24.124
I mean, I'd feel terrible!

05:24.157 --> 05:25.893
Okay? A boulder
would decimate her

05:25.926 --> 05:27.595
and her guts would
be everywhere.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.663
Okay, wow.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.665
Rebecca,

05:31.699 --> 05:32.900
you are getting close to Josh.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.635
I can feel it.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.903
And if you could just get
into that turkey dinner,

05:35.936 --> 05:38.105
you would be set.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.141
It's the holidays, Paula.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.744
People don't always get
what they want.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.484
(bird squawks)

05:50.518 --> 05:52.786
(whooping)

05:52.820 --> 05:55.589
*

05:56.990 --> 05:58.926
Mr. Kincaid, you shouldn't have.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.160
Oh, you didn't.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.862
You never do.

06:01.895 --> 06:04.064
Lynne, I think that's enough.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.866
I can't have you passing out
in the bleachers again.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.869
You don't tell me what to do.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.771
Okay. Great.

06:10.804 --> 06:13.073
Good luck with that.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.676
(indistinct chatter)

06:22.616 --> 06:23.784
REBECCA:
Greg! Greg!

06:23.817 --> 06:25.586
Did you know that
for Thanksgiving

06:25.619 --> 06:26.954
Chris' family
makes tamales?

06:26.987 --> 06:28.422
I love it!

06:28.456 --> 06:30.023
It's an update
on the corn theme.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.925
You're just full of
fascinating facts.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.628
Okay, Mr. Grumpy, I thought
we were friends again.

06:35.763 --> 06:36.797
Give me that smile.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.966
There it is. Yeah.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.868
So what are you doing for
Thanksgiving? Anything special?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.603
Yep.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.037
This year everything
is gonna be different.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.973
Savor that,

06:46.006 --> 06:47.908
because that's the last drink
I'm ever gonna make you.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.209
Yep, that's right.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.045
I am quitting this crappy job.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.981
As soon as this
shift ends.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.484
I can't wait to walk in
and tell my boss to shove it.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.519
It's gonna be
all Jerry Maguire

06:58.552 --> 06:59.987
mixed in with
a little Norma Rae.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.222
Oh, yeah. Someone stole
a Netflix password.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.057
Yeah, I finally
saved up enough money

07:04.091 --> 07:06.594
to move out
and to go to business school.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.929
I just have to find a nurse
for my dad first.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.531
Wow. Wait, business school?

07:10.564 --> 07:11.965
This is great.
This is what you wanted.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.234
Yep. My dad's not gonna
be happy I'm moving out,

07:14.267 --> 07:16.570
but I figure I tell him
over Thanksgiving dinner,

07:16.604 --> 07:18.138
then we'll patch
things up

07:18.171 --> 07:19.873
over buffalo mozzarella
and prosciutto,

07:19.907 --> 07:21.709
just like they did
in the first Thanksgiving.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.544
Wait. Really?

07:25.045 --> 07:27.014
I go to public school.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.516
Obviously.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.950
This is great.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.085
This is...
everything you wanted.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.554
You're moving on.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.923
It's awesome,
you deserve it.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.525
I'm gonna miss you.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.093
Can I buy you a drink
before you move?

07:40.127 --> 07:42.029
What's the catch?

07:42.062 --> 07:43.697
No catch. It's a free drink.
You in or out?

07:43.731 --> 07:45.933
In. Hey, V.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.001
Hey, Greg.
What brings you by?

07:48.035 --> 07:49.870
Oh, just picking Elena
up from softball.

07:49.903 --> 07:50.838
Hey, Valencia.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.541
Hey, V-ster.
V-dog?

07:53.574 --> 07:55.543
VW?
VW Bus?

07:55.576 --> 07:57.878
What-what are your plans
for Thanksgiving, Valencia?

07:57.911 --> 07:58.946
Bye, Greg.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.814
Bye, Valencia!

08:00.848 --> 08:03.283
I like your sleeveless
crocheted trench coat!

08:03.316 --> 08:04.685
Wow.

08:04.718 --> 08:05.953
You guys have such
a great rapport.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.521
Yeah, she doesn't
like me so much.

08:07.555 --> 08:08.622
No, she doesn't like you a lot.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.057
But to be fair,

08:10.090 --> 08:10.958
she's probably in a bad mood

08:10.991 --> 08:12.793
because it's Thanksgiving.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.094
She goes to Josh's house,
and it's tough for her.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.029
What, to bask
in the warm embrace

08:16.063 --> 08:18.165
of a loving Filipino family?
Why is that tough?

08:18.198 --> 08:20.000
You don't know?

08:20.033 --> 08:21.702
The Chans don't
like Valencia.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.003
Because Asians don't
like dumb people.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.005
Chris!

08:25.038 --> 08:26.707
So mildly racist.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.108
It's a problem.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.310
Every time Valencia has
to hang with the Chans,

08:30.343 --> 08:31.812
she and Josh
almost break up.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.746
I had no idea.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.216
Poor Josh.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.619
Poor Valencia, too.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.821
*

08:46.093 --> 08:47.561
REBECCA:
I can't get over it.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.730
Poor Josh. Poor Valencia.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.666
It must be awful to go
to your boyfriend's house

08:52.700 --> 08:54.568
and just not feel
like you belong.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.336
Yeah, it's really
unfortunate.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.339
I've never been
to this place.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.610
There's a lot
of bok choy

09:02.643 --> 09:05.946
and live fish
with whiskers.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.815
And all the Asians.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.651
What are you up to?

09:10.684 --> 09:12.085
Don't you understand

09:12.119 --> 09:13.954
that the tension between
Valencia and the Chans,

09:13.987 --> 09:16.056
that's your in,
that's your boulder.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.758
You are gonna crush
her little bird bones.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.126
What's going on?
What am I doing here?

09:19.159 --> 09:21.128
You are a parent's dream.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.130
And as soon as Josh's parents
get a look at you,

09:23.163 --> 09:24.598
they're going to fall in love.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.999
And he will follow.

09:26.033 --> 09:29.002
Okay... but how are they going
to get a look at me?

09:29.036 --> 09:32.906
I don't exactly see them
around anywhere...

09:34.742 --> 09:37.110
Mrs. Chan.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.979
Oh, I get it.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.814
I see what
you did there
Yep.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.249
Should've seen
that coming.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.284
*

09:50.190 --> 09:52.025
MAN:
The boss is back.
Look busy.

09:53.727 --> 09:54.995
Hey, Kevin.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.365
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Sure, what's up?

09:58.398 --> 10:01.001
I'll tell you what's up.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.904
What's up is that every day
I work in this bar,

10:03.937 --> 10:07.107
I feel like I am eating
a sandwich of bile and tears.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.809
Ugh.
Shh. Please.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.143
I have a thing prepared.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.278
I'm here to tell you

10:11.311 --> 10:13.747
that I've reached the Rubicon,

10:13.781 --> 10:15.749
my own personal tipping point...

10:15.783 --> 10:17.017
Nice line.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.051
You write that?

10:18.085 --> 10:19.319
Wait, are you quitting?

10:19.352 --> 10:20.854
Good for you!

10:20.888 --> 10:22.155
Kevin, please.
I gotta get this out.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.224
I quit this bar!

10:24.257 --> 10:25.859
Yeah, I just said that.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.995
I quit making blended drinks
for bad tippers.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.397
I quit using a cash register
that spells mojito with an "H."

10:30.430 --> 10:32.900
I quit your terrible breath.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.902
Appreciate the feedback.

10:34.935 --> 10:35.836
I had a dental
procedure.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.404
I really should irrigate

10:37.437 --> 10:40.107
more frequently.
Kevin, you're
ruining this for me.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.042
Wait, are you going back
to business school?!

10:42.075 --> 10:43.844
This is fantastic!

10:43.877 --> 10:46.213
I always wondered
when you were gonna!

10:46.246 --> 10:49.216
You're too good for this place.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.784
(chuckles)
Now, bring it here.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.820
What...?

10:54.888 --> 10:57.390
Now, you, get out of here!

11:04.097 --> 11:05.866
How did you know
she was here?

11:05.899 --> 11:07.134
It's best if I don't
share that with you.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.702
Come on, let's
go talk to her.

11:08.736 --> 11:09.937
No, I don't want
to talk to her.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.071
This is embarrassing.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.106
Paula, come on.
I don't want to make

11:13.140 --> 11:14.141
an ass of myself--
oh, oh!

11:14.174 --> 11:15.709
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Chan.

11:15.743 --> 11:16.777
Oh, hello.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.712
Hi, Mrs. Chan.

11:18.746 --> 11:19.880
I don't know if
you remember me.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.181
I'm Rebecca Bunch.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.216
I went to camp
with your son Josh

11:23.250 --> 11:26.119
like ten-ish years ago.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.955
Oh, of course!

11:27.988 --> 11:30.858
You two had that
adorable little romance!

11:30.891 --> 11:32.459
Right, I called the
house a couple times.

11:32.492 --> 11:35.062
Left a couple
funny messages.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.063
How have you been?

11:36.096 --> 11:37.064
I've been so grea... great.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.198
How has she been?!

11:38.231 --> 11:40.500
Harvard undergrad,
Yale law, 1550 SATs,

11:40.533 --> 11:43.370
winner NCAJ Mock Trial
Championships.

11:43.403 --> 11:46.006
Oh, that is all very,

11:46.039 --> 11:47.440
uh, impressive.

11:47.474 --> 11:48.742
Isn't it?

11:48.776 --> 11:51.044
Hi. Paula, coworker,
confidant.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.846
(laughs)

11:52.880 --> 11:54.915
Rebecca, welcome to town.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.283
You should join us
for dinner sometime.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.151
That's so sweet of you.
I would love that.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.719
What about tomorrow?

12:01.021 --> 12:03.123
Paula, no, that's Thanksgiving.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.258
And you have
nowhere to go.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.260
You poor thing.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.129
She saw her parents
murdered in front of her...

12:09.162 --> 12:12.165
in an alley...
in Gotham.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.400
Oh, dear.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.236
Just like Batman.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.204
Yes.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.271
So Paula's-- I'm sorry.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.840
Paula's joking.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.441
My parents aren't dead.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.310
They're just abandoning
and frigid, so...

12:23.343 --> 12:24.812
I see.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.446
That's also very terrible.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.081
Exactly.
Uh, guess so.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.017
I mean, I would ask her
to come to my house,

12:30.050 --> 12:32.085
but we're going to Paris.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.821
'Cause that's
where we autumn.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.156
It's like wintering
but cheaper.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.958
Aw, Rebecca!

12:37.991 --> 12:40.260
You shouldn't be alone
on Thanksgiving.

12:40.293 --> 12:43.163
Why don't you come over
and spend the holiday with us?

12:43.196 --> 12:46.133
Josh will be
so thrilled.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.335
Oh... um...

12:48.368 --> 12:50.470
I would love that.

12:50.503 --> 12:51.571
Yeah.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.174
That's so generous of you.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.508
I would be honored.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.177
What can I bring?

12:57.210 --> 12:59.947
Oh, just bring your appetite,
my dear.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.148
See you tomorrow.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.116
Okay, thank you so much again.
Bye.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.218
Bye!

13:05.252 --> 13:07.020
Whoa! Whoa!

13:07.054 --> 13:08.956
I'm actually going to--
wait-- a real Thanksgiving

13:08.989 --> 13:10.924
with a real family?!
I know.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.325
Wait, oh, no, wait.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.961
What's Josh gonna think

13:13.994 --> 13:15.395
when I just show up
to his house randomly?

13:15.428 --> 13:17.130
Yeah, we're gonna
find out in a second.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.331
She's texting him
right now.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.237
(phone chimes)

13:30.477 --> 13:31.912
You're an evil genius.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.213
Uh-huh, yeah.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.281
You're welcome.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.548
Welcome to the fam-bam.

13:39.086 --> 13:42.189
* It's got to be love

13:42.222 --> 13:44.257
* What else could
feel like this? *

13:44.291 --> 13:46.359
(birds chirping in distance)

13:46.393 --> 13:49.396
* It's got to be love

13:49.429 --> 13:51.398
* It started with...

13:51.431 --> 13:53.433
(door closes)

13:55.568 --> 13:58.939
Dad, what is this--
a heart-attack buffet?

13:58.972 --> 14:00.640
Get off my ass, Greg.
It's a holiday.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.910
I'm enjoying the things
that make life worthwhile.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.245
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that's
for Sinatra and Tormé.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.180
By all means, serve the high-end
food to your macaws.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.349
It's not enough that you
let them crap in the shower.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.051
I'm training them.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.219
Dad, all I'm saying is,
if you're gonna go

14:12.252 --> 14:13.120
through the trouble
to train them,

14:13.153 --> 14:14.888
train them
to use the toilet.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.189
Oh, that's a good
idea-- they're birds.

14:16.223 --> 14:17.524
Maybe I should train them
to wipe their ass.

14:17.557 --> 14:18.525
(laughs)

14:18.558 --> 14:20.160
(coughing)

14:20.193 --> 14:21.161
Do you need the oxygen tank?

14:21.194 --> 14:23.196
No, no, no, no.
Stop it.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.532
Why you bothering me?

14:25.565 --> 14:27.534
Isn't there some girl
you could be trying to bang?

14:27.567 --> 14:30.503
Oh, what about that, that crazy
girl you met at the party?

14:30.537 --> 14:32.405
The one from the taco festival?

14:32.439 --> 14:34.107
Why do I tell you anything?

14:34.141 --> 14:35.142
Oh, right, I was drunk.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.010
That girl's not for me, Dad.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.411
Trust me, Dad,
listen.
Sure.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.247
Listen to me.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.115
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.517
Some, um,
changes I want to make.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.219
Me, too.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.121
I'm thinking
about a third macaw.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.690
I'm thinking Bennett
for Tony Bennett.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.926
(laughs)

14:54.561 --> 14:56.263
Oh, so serious.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.230
What is it?

14:57.264 --> 14:59.399
Tell me.
(coughing)

14:59.432 --> 15:02.502
I'll get the tank.

15:02.535 --> 15:05.538
Yep, yep... ah.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.142
MAN:
So you want to speak Tagalog,

15:09.176 --> 15:11.144
the mother tongue
of the Philippines.

15:11.178 --> 15:12.479
Let's start with "Hello."

15:12.512 --> 15:14.314
Mabuhay-- say it with me.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.116
BOTH:
 Mabuhay.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.284
"Nice to meet you."

15:17.317 --> 15:22.055
BOTH:
 Natutwa akong makilala kayo.

15:22.089 --> 15:25.292
Okay, I know
I'm forgetting something.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.227
(gasps)

15:27.260 --> 15:29.229
Whoa! Ooh!

15:38.505 --> 15:40.507
No, okay.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.323
(knocking)

15:56.356 --> 15:58.025
PAULA:
Heya!

15:58.058 --> 16:00.660
Whew, something
smells weird in here.

16:00.693 --> 16:03.096
Oh, uh, well,
it's a Filipino dish

16:03.130 --> 16:05.632
called dinuguan-- it consists
of pork cooked in pork's blood.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.100
Do you want to try some?

16:07.134 --> 16:09.236
Uh, thanks, but I think

16:09.269 --> 16:12.239
I'm all full up
from the wonderful smell.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.306
You know what? That's just

16:13.340 --> 16:15.542
your culturally insensitive
taste buds talking.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.077
Okay, I can only
stay for a second.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.711
I'm making pies
for people that I hate.

16:18.745 --> 16:22.482
Which is mixed emotions for me,
because I like pie.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.483
Okay.

16:23.516 --> 16:26.286
As discussed, here it is.

16:26.319 --> 16:30.457
This brooch contains a small
video camera and microphone.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.425
It's exactly like
the teddy bear nanny cam

16:32.459 --> 16:35.162
that we used in the Gatwick
divorce, but with audio.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.596
No...
So it will
transmit everything

16:36.629 --> 16:39.366
you see and hear directly
to an app on my phone,

16:39.399 --> 16:41.801
so I will not miss
any of your triumph.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.736
(laughs)

16:43.770 --> 16:45.572
This isn't weird, right?
Is it weird?

16:45.605 --> 16:47.374
No.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.808
Okay, cool.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.278
I got to go, but I cannot wait

16:51.311 --> 16:54.414
to watch you push Valderrama
out of the picture.

16:57.150 --> 17:00.687

17:12.865 --> 17:14.601
REBECCA:

* Bitches, you two
have wonderful taste *

18:05.185 --> 18:06.653
* Sit down at the table
and I'm murdering *

18:06.686 --> 18:09.389
* Inquiring what
line of work they're in *

18:09.422 --> 18:10.557
* Making faces
like I'm crazed erotically *

* Wait, my uncle

18:29.609 --> 18:31.511
* It means I'm dazzling

18:31.544 --> 18:33.380
* Like an anaconda,
bitch, I'm immense *

18:33.413 --> 18:35.415
* And you a common wench,

18:35.448 --> 18:37.417
* Boss-ass bitch,
no one's above me *

18:37.450 --> 18:39.219
* End of the night,
they line up to hug me *

18:39.252 --> 18:40.920
* Oh, my gosh,
this was so lovely *

18:40.953 --> 18:43.190
* To be clear, your parents
want to have sex with me *

18:43.223 --> 18:45.525
* I give good parent

18:45.558 --> 18:47.394
MRS. CHAN:
* She gives good parent

18:47.427 --> 18:49.529
* I give good parent

18:49.562 --> 18:51.831
* To parents like me.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.900
(laughs)

18:53.933 --> 18:55.368
(laughter)

18:55.402 --> 18:57.237
So I open up
the chest in the attic,

18:57.270 --> 18:58.871
and there it is!

18:58.905 --> 19:01.508
Let's just say that was
one very late library book.

19:01.541 --> 19:04.444
(laughter)

19:06.613 --> 19:08.581
Oh, my God,
your sisters love that story.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.483
Yeah, up top, Jayma.
Yeah!

19:10.517 --> 19:11.951
Up top, Jastenity.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.453
Okay.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.388
Whoa.

19:15.422 --> 19:16.423
My dad never smiles.

19:16.456 --> 19:17.524
You almost got one there.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.592
So, um, how did

19:19.626 --> 19:21.494
your Thanksgiving
food plan work out?

19:21.528 --> 19:23.363
I noticed that you had
a lot of the dinuguan.

19:23.396 --> 19:24.597
Yeah, it looked
so good this year,

19:24.631 --> 19:26.533
I nixed the yams
with the marshmallows.

19:26.566 --> 19:29.202
Interesting.
Uh, fun fact-- I made it.

19:29.236 --> 19:30.603
No. No, you did not.

19:30.637 --> 19:31.971
Yeah.
Get out of here.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.707
Are you sure you're
not Filipino?

19:34.741 --> 19:37.510
I wish, I wish I could be
from your country.

19:37.544 --> 19:38.478
I can only be so lucky.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.480
MRS. CHAN:
Oh, Rebecca.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.216
It's wonderful that you
are such a bookworm.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.652
Ah, we have
something in common.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.820
I am in a very
interesting book club.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.522
I love books and clubs.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.324
Two of my favorite things.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.460
You should join.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.362
We would love to have
a young person like you.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.397
Oh, yeah.
I would love to go

19:57.430 --> 19:58.565
to your book club,
too, Mrs. Chan.

19:58.598 --> 19:59.632
I actually just read a book.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.000
It's about journaling.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.735
Lea Michele wrote it.

20:02.769 --> 20:03.836
Lots of blank pages.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.438
So it's basically a journal.

20:05.472 --> 20:09.376
Uh-huh, I see.
(laughs)

20:09.409 --> 20:11.678
Would you like
more turkey, Rebecca?

20:11.711 --> 20:15.515
Ma, you promised to be nicer
to Valencia this year.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.584
What?

20:17.617 --> 20:19.586
*

20:28.761 --> 20:31.264
(Paula laughing)

20:35.568 --> 20:36.669
What you watching?

20:36.703 --> 20:38.237
Your soap?

20:39.639 --> 20:40.607
Yeah, my soap opera.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.309
I knew it.

20:42.342 --> 20:43.676
I remember you liked that.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.678
All of My Days
or something like that?

20:45.712 --> 20:47.647
That's the, that's the one.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.452
All right, Dad,
let me get this out.

20:52.485 --> 20:55.455
Listen, I love living
with you...

20:57.490 --> 20:59.025
Dad?

20:59.058 --> 21:01.260
Dad?
Damn it!

21:08.468 --> 21:09.636
We've been here before.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.571
He needs one in the small
of his back.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.373
Otherwise, the farts
have nowhere to go.

21:13.406 --> 21:14.341
Here, I can do it.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.776
Oh, thanks, Greg.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.077
I don't like a hot butt.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.579
Nobody does, Dad.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.013
(knocking)

21:21.047 --> 21:23.450
Um, may I speak
with you privately, Mr. Serrano?

21:26.953 --> 21:28.421
So we were able
to stabilize him,

21:28.455 --> 21:29.922
but we have a couple
of concerns.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.758
One, his oxygen levels
are too low,

21:31.791 --> 21:33.460
so we need to run
some more tests.

21:33.493 --> 21:37.464
And two... your dad keeps
asking me to go outside

21:37.497 --> 21:39.332
and have a cigarette
and some whiskey with him.

21:39.366 --> 21:41.401
Mm.
Not okay.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.435
In a lot of ways.

21:42.469 --> 21:45.538
MARCO:
Cathy, the menthols?

21:45.572 --> 21:47.774
I'm sorry he still smokes...

21:47.807 --> 21:50.377
and drinks and
literally eats lard.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.612
He doesn't listen
to me, he never has.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.014
Well, that's not the problem--
I mean, it is a problem--

21:55.047 --> 21:57.450
it's just that
his emphysema has progressed

21:57.484 --> 21:59.051
from a stage one
to a stage two,

21:59.085 --> 22:00.487
which means we need
to change the protocol,

22:00.520 --> 22:01.654
add some medications.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.756
Okay.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.425
The thing is,
our best treatment options

22:05.458 --> 22:06.959
aren't covered
by your insurance.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.962
So if you'd like to proceed,
I'll need your approval.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.831
How much is it going...?

22:13.800 --> 22:16.403
Whoa, how am I supposed
to pay for that?

22:16.436 --> 22:19.972
*

22:20.006 --> 22:21.974
Here you go, I'll take that.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.810
And I will take that, sir.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.445
Sit, sit, sit.

22:25.478 --> 22:26.646
Honestly, I just want
some private time

22:26.679 --> 22:28.481
so I can lick all these
plates myself.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.483
Too gross or too honest?
Take a vote, BRB.

22:30.517 --> 22:31.518
(laughs)

22:35.622 --> 22:36.789
Oh, honey,
well, look at that.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.425
You've barely eaten anything.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.626
You must be starving.

22:39.659 --> 22:40.727
Of course I'm starving.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.429
I've been starving since 1998.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.063
You know what, that is
the media telling you

22:44.096 --> 22:46.799
what your body should be,
and it just gets my goat...

22:46.833 --> 22:48.801
Oh, cut the crap.

22:48.835 --> 22:51.738
I see what you're doing,
sucking up to Josh's parents.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.573
Well, it's not gonna work.

22:53.606 --> 22:57.143
Parents may love brown-nosers,
but men, like Josh, love me.

22:57.176 --> 22:58.578
(scoffs)

22:58.611 --> 23:00.513
You are out of your depth.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.849
You don't understand
our relationship,

23:02.882 --> 23:04.684
and you don't understand Josh.

23:04.717 --> 23:05.885
We have history.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.520
We have chemistry.

23:07.554 --> 23:09.722
Well, that's a lot
of academic subjects.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.724
You think he's
gonna find you sexy

23:11.758 --> 23:13.626
when you're spending all day
shopping with his mom

23:13.660 --> 23:14.827
for visors?

23:14.861 --> 23:17.029
Ooh, girl, hang in there.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.631
(clicks tongue)

23:18.665 --> 23:20.633
Oh, honey.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.469
You're having a tough day.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.704
I get it, the holidays
can be stressful.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.105
Can I get you anything?

23:26.138 --> 23:28.441
Maybe a hot cup of arroz caldo?

23:28.475 --> 23:30.677
I don't need chicken soup,
thank you.

23:30.710 --> 23:33.112
Chicken soup is just
hot melted fat water.

23:33.145 --> 23:36.182
You don't belong here--
this is not your family.

23:36.215 --> 23:38.918
And good luck digesting
all that gross food.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.555
That's culturally insensitive.

23:43.656 --> 23:46.125
LOURDES:
Time for the family photo.

23:46.158 --> 23:47.994
Don't belong here?
That's ridiculous.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.496
Smile!
(camera shutter clicks)

23:57.236 --> 23:58.638
Hey, Kevin.

24:01.140 --> 24:04.010
Listen, um...

24:04.043 --> 24:06.879
I said a lot of regrettable
things yesterday,

24:06.913 --> 24:09.516
and I wanted you
to know I'm sorry.

24:09.549 --> 24:10.650
You were only saying what
others were thinking.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.051
Thank you.

24:12.084 --> 24:14.186
I got a tongue scraper.

24:14.220 --> 24:17.223
Things are looking
hhhheeexxxcellent.

24:17.256 --> 24:18.224
(chuckles)

24:18.257 --> 24:19.526
That's terrific.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.561
It's minty.
Yeah.

24:21.594 --> 24:23.696
You want your job
back, don't you?

24:23.730 --> 24:25.665
I do.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.867
You think that's the first
Netflix quit I've seen?

24:27.900 --> 24:30.870
Had a busboy do the entire
Peter Finch speech from Network.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.872
Shouted out of a
window and everything.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.507
Oh, it was Javier.

24:34.541 --> 24:35.875
JAVIER:
Welcome back, Greg.

24:35.908 --> 24:39.512
"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not
gonna take it anymore!"

24:39.546 --> 24:41.147
Oh, it was great.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.248
You should have been there.

24:42.281 --> 24:45.017
Ah, they all come back.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.987
Greg, you want your
job back, it's yours.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.557
Ah.
Ooh.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.191
Ah, ah.
(chuckles)

24:52.224 --> 24:55.261
I forgot how much fun
it was here-- I missed that.

24:55.294 --> 24:57.664
Yeah.
Um, listen, I really
appreciate this,

24:57.697 --> 25:00.099
but I don't want to work
today, it's Thanksgiving,

25:00.132 --> 25:03.069
and I have seniority,
I can pick my shifts.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.537
Had seniority.

25:04.571 --> 25:05.705
So sorry.

25:05.738 --> 25:06.939
Oh, and, uh...

25:06.973 --> 25:09.576
the toilets
are clogged.

25:09.609 --> 25:11.644
Who flushes a jump rope?

25:13.312 --> 25:14.547
So sorry.

25:14.581 --> 25:16.783
Aunt Dhori, I insist

25:16.816 --> 25:18.184
that you call me.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.019
I think we have
a case here, I really do.

25:20.052 --> 25:22.855
Listen, if the frozen
dinner box says

25:22.889 --> 25:26.292
that there are five shrimp,
there should be five, not four.

25:26.325 --> 25:28.127
Yeah, totally.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.195
Okay.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.030
Call me, yeah.

25:31.063 --> 25:34.033
Rebecca, thank you so much
for coming today.

25:34.066 --> 25:37.670
We are so thankful
God sent you to us.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.105
REBECCA: Oh...
(both chuckle)

25:39.138 --> 25:41.708
"God sent you to us."

25:41.741 --> 25:43.309
Aw, that's nice, Paula.

25:43.342 --> 25:44.310
Thought you hated me.

25:44.343 --> 25:45.712
I do.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.146
Everyone hates you.

25:47.179 --> 25:49.348
You're racist.

25:49.381 --> 25:54.186
Well, um, thanks
again for everything.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.690
I guess I should really go.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.125
Yeah, you really should.

25:59.158 --> 26:01.327
Valencia.
What? She wants to go.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.796
Well, good-bye.

26:03.830 --> 26:06.032
Bye, Jayma. Bye, Jastenity.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.366
Wait, Rebecca.

26:07.399 --> 26:10.202
Would you join our
family for mass?

26:10.236 --> 26:11.771
We'd love
to have you.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.806
Um, she's Jewish.

26:15.642 --> 26:18.277
I would be so honored,
Mrs. Chan, thank you.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.946
Wow, can I just say,

26:19.979 --> 26:23.750
you have made me feel
like I truly belong.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.785
Oh, of course you do.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.755
Great, I'll also
join for mass

26:28.788 --> 26:31.758
because I actually
believe in Jesus.

26:31.791 --> 26:32.959
(chuckling):
Knock yourself out.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.794
It's a public place
of worship.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.062
(stomach gurgling)

26:36.095 --> 26:38.665
Uh, where is your powder room
really quickly?

26:38.698 --> 26:40.399
Oh, it's just down
the hall, sweetie.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.734
Okay... thank you.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.069
I'll be right...

26:43.102 --> 26:45.104
Thanks.
(stomach gurgling)

26:46.205 --> 26:48.307
(speaks indistinctly)

26:50.309 --> 26:52.311
(cell phone ringing)

26:54.013 --> 26:55.748
(whispering):
Hey. Hey, Paula.

26:55.782 --> 26:58.350
Hey, cookie,
you are crushing it!

26:58.384 --> 27:00.019
Yeah, I know,
it's going so well.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.120
Okay, listen.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.822
I have to go to the bathroom,

27:02.855 --> 27:04.223
(door slams)
but I will call you...

27:04.256 --> 27:05.858
Wait-wait, wait-wait,
wait, hold on.

27:05.892 --> 27:07.226
Hold on. Hold it,
somebody's here.

27:07.259 --> 27:08.861
Oh, crap.

27:08.895 --> 27:11.030
I really have to poo-poo.
Okay, hold on.

27:11.063 --> 27:13.365
VALENCIA: I'm so... I try so
hard to be nice to your mom,

27:13.399 --> 27:15.167
and all she ever gives me
is stink face.

27:15.201 --> 27:17.069
Hold on, shh, shh, shh.
JOSH: Babe, babe, babe,
she-she loves you.

27:17.103 --> 27:18.905
And you just stood
there doing nothing

27:18.938 --> 27:20.840
while she sucked up to everyone
like a vacuum cleaner.

27:20.873 --> 27:22.241
(gasps)
Come on, Rebecca
was just being nice.

27:22.274 --> 27:23.843
It's Josh and Valencia.
Nice?!

27:23.876 --> 27:25.878
VALENCIA:
So naive, Josh!

27:25.912 --> 27:27.714
You don't see
who she really is.

27:27.747 --> 27:30.717
(gasps)
They're fighting.

27:30.750 --> 27:33.052
It's so sad.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.887
Oh, my God, I can hear it.

27:34.921 --> 27:36.723
You didn't even sit
next to me.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.725
I told you I wanted to
be closer to the turkey.

27:38.758 --> 27:39.892
I like the skin!

27:39.926 --> 27:41.794
PAULA: I can hear it.
Why don't you
stick up for me?

27:41.828 --> 27:43.362
Oh, my God, this is it--
this is the boulder.

27:43.395 --> 27:44.764
Wait-wait, wait, wait, wait,
shh, shh, shh.

27:44.797 --> 27:46.198
Wait, wait, I can't hear.

27:46.232 --> 27:48.134
Wait.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.135
It's gone quiet.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.937
What happened?

27:50.970 --> 27:52.371
Did she kill him?

27:52.404 --> 27:54.140
(mattress springs
squeak rhythmically)

27:56.175 --> 27:57.777
What is that sound?

27:57.810 --> 28:00.980
Wait, I don't know.

28:01.013 --> 28:04.483
Maybe it's a tiny trampoline.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.786
Or a ghost with a rusty knee?

28:06.819 --> 28:08.955
(Valencia moans)
Oh, my God, Rebecca,
are they...?

28:08.988 --> 28:10.990
(Josh and Valencia moaning)

28:12.058 --> 28:13.392
Oh, no.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.427
(Valencia moans)
JOSH: Oh, yeah.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.770
Run out of the room.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.271
Just sprint by their writhing
bodies and escape.

28:25.304 --> 28:26.505
(stomach gurgling)
No, no-no, I can't.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.808
Because if I move,
my bowels will explode.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.743
Like, all over the walls.

28:30.777 --> 28:32.879
Wait, shh, shh, shh.
Shh, I think they've stopped.

28:32.912 --> 28:35.782
I think they stopped,
hold on, hold on.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.416
(bed resumes squeaking)
(Josh and Valencia moaning)

28:37.449 --> 28:41.253
Oh, God, the stamina.

28:41.287 --> 28:43.122
Why won't this end?

28:47.159 --> 28:49.161
When is this gonna end?

28:53.900 --> 28:55.267
Huh.

28:55.301 --> 28:58.137
Never noticed that before.

29:11.417 --> 29:15.387
* It's 5:53 on Thanksgiving

29:15.421 --> 29:19.391
* Not one customer's walked
through the door *

29:19.425 --> 29:24.230
* But I'm still here,
slinging drinks for a living *

29:24.263 --> 29:27.099
* I've never played
piano before *

29:30.269 --> 29:32.238
Not bad.

29:32.271 --> 29:35.541
* I know this town
like the back of my hand *

29:35.574 --> 29:39.979
* But I'm not such a fan
of the back of my hand *

29:40.012 --> 29:41.981
* 'Cause if you look
real close *

29:42.014 --> 29:43.983
* At those little hairs
and veins *

29:44.016 --> 29:46.385
* You're like,
"Hands are sort of gross" *

29:46.418 --> 29:51.223
* It's hard to explain

29:51.257 --> 29:53.225
* The point is

29:53.259 --> 29:56.863
* Hey, West Covina

29:56.896 --> 30:00.499
* Why won't you
let me break free? *

30:00.532 --> 30:02.501
* Am I doomed to stay here

30:02.534 --> 30:04.904
* Pouring my high school
friends beers *

30:04.937 --> 30:08.975
* For the rest of eternity?

30:09.008 --> 30:13.212
* Hey, West Covina

30:13.245 --> 30:17.216
* You know just
where to find me *

30:17.249 --> 30:21.520
* I'll never go far,
so pull up to the bar *

30:21.553 --> 30:24.924
* Hey, West Covina

30:24.957 --> 30:28.394
* What'll it be?

30:34.233 --> 30:37.603
* It's 5:55,
I'm still singing *

30:37.636 --> 30:41.040
* The big Turkey Day game's
letting out *

30:41.073 --> 30:43.876
* But no one's coming here

30:43.910 --> 30:45.878
* Who am I kidding?

30:45.912 --> 30:50.282
* Hey, you sunburned MILFs,
give me a shout *

30:50.316 --> 30:54.921
* Everyone's going home 'cause
it's time to give thanks *

30:54.954 --> 30:59.325
* Thanks for the chain stores
and outlets and banks *

30:59.358 --> 31:03.329
* Thanks for this town three
short hours from the beach *

31:03.362 --> 31:08.267
* Where all of your dreams
can stay just out of reach... *

31:09.701 --> 31:12.071
(imitates drum fill)

31:12.104 --> 31:15.507
* Hey, West Covina

31:15.541 --> 31:19.511
* You're not listening,
so what's the use? *

31:19.545 --> 31:23.983
* Is my purpose in life
to slice limes with a knife? *

31:24.016 --> 31:28.687
* Or to serve Deb a vodka
and cranberry juice? *

31:28.720 --> 31:30.957
Hey, Deb,
I'll be right with you.

31:30.990 --> 31:34.927
* Hey, West Covina

31:34.961 --> 31:37.563
* Look what you're doing to me

31:37.596 --> 31:40.967
* Can't you see, West Covina

31:41.000 --> 31:42.601
* You're killing me,
West Covina *

31:42.634 --> 31:46.939
* Last call, West Covina

31:46.973 --> 31:51.944
* What'll it be?

31:59.118 --> 32:01.120
(pop music playing on radio)

32:10.562 --> 32:13.032
Hold on. Hold on. Wait,
I think they might be gone.

32:13.065 --> 32:14.133
Shh. Hold on.

32:16.335 --> 32:18.104
Oh...

32:20.306 --> 32:21.273
Yes. Yes.

32:21.307 --> 32:22.441
Okay, they're gone.

32:22.474 --> 32:24.276
Go to the bathroom, honey.

32:24.310 --> 32:26.045
No. I'm gonna make a run for it

32:26.078 --> 32:27.113
because I can't be
in this house any longer.

32:27.146 --> 32:28.347
Are you crazy?

32:28.380 --> 32:30.049
You'll never make it!

32:30.082 --> 32:31.117
You will never make it.

32:31.150 --> 32:34.420
(stomach gurgling)

32:44.796 --> 32:46.532
There you are!

32:46.565 --> 32:48.000
Ready for church?

32:48.034 --> 32:49.768
You know, I really want to go,

32:49.801 --> 32:52.104
but I have to take a giant...
(stomach gurgling)

32:52.138 --> 32:53.339
rain check.

32:53.372 --> 32:54.540
(clinking)

32:54.573 --> 32:55.541
Everyone...

32:55.574 --> 32:57.409
I have an announcement to make.

32:57.443 --> 32:59.178
Today has been
a special day.

32:59.211 --> 33:01.147
So nice to see everyone here

33:01.180 --> 33:02.548
from, you know,
Rancho Cucamonga,

33:02.581 --> 33:05.084
and Stockton,
Monrovia,

33:05.117 --> 33:06.152
Victorville...

33:06.185 --> 33:07.753
Yeah, all the places!

33:07.786 --> 33:09.621
JOSH:
I'm so thankful for
the wonderful meal

33:09.655 --> 33:11.290
and for, you know,

33:11.323 --> 33:13.659
sharing great laughs,
as always.
(stomach gurgling)

33:13.692 --> 33:17.096
But there were also
some challenging moments.

33:17.129 --> 33:19.498
Those moments are
really important, too.

33:19.531 --> 33:22.101
Because of those moments,

33:22.134 --> 33:23.769
we find out what really matters

33:23.802 --> 33:26.638
and are reminded
where we belong.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.274
And I belong...

33:28.307 --> 33:31.110
with Valencia.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.048
On that note,

33:36.082 --> 33:38.484
and in front of
the people I love the most

33:38.517 --> 33:39.818
and who love me
the most...

33:39.851 --> 33:44.423
V, I want to ask
you something.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.758
(quiet murmuring)

33:46.792 --> 33:50.762
Valencia...

33:50.796 --> 33:53.499
will you move
in with me?
(gasps)

33:53.532 --> 33:55.134
I do!

33:55.167 --> 33:56.835
I mean, I will.

33:56.868 --> 34:02.074
No...
No...

34:06.112 --> 34:07.613
Now, who wants
to go see Jesus?

34:07.646 --> 34:08.647
(laughter)

34:13.319 --> 34:16.121
(TV plays indistinctly)

34:16.155 --> 34:17.688
Hey.
Hey.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.425
I brought your robe.
I know you hate

34:19.458 --> 34:21.092
that these hospital gowns
leave your ass hanging out.

34:21.127 --> 34:23.295
My ass will hang out
when I say it should.

34:23.329 --> 34:25.264
I am the captain of my own ass.

34:25.297 --> 34:27.299
(both laugh)

34:29.201 --> 34:30.668
I know what you did.
What?

34:30.702 --> 34:32.204
(scoffs)

34:32.237 --> 34:33.772
One of the nurses
ratted you out.

34:33.804 --> 34:36.375
You spent
all your savings?

34:36.408 --> 34:37.643
On me?

34:37.676 --> 34:39.678
(laughing):
Why?

34:39.710 --> 34:41.112
I'm a lost cause.

34:41.147 --> 34:42.348
Run, like your mother did.

34:42.380 --> 34:43.614
Save yourself.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.217
And-and the macaws.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.851
You need those treatments.

34:46.885 --> 34:48.820
You gotta go to school.
Move out.

34:48.853 --> 34:50.789
It's-it's time.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.391
Don't you tell me
what to do.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.360
I make my own decisions,
thank you very much,

34:54.393 --> 34:56.362
and I'm not going
anywhere, sorry.

34:56.395 --> 34:58.830
Now...
Don't, don't...
fight me on this.

34:58.864 --> 35:01.300
Look at you, old man,

35:01.333 --> 35:03.902
you'd lose.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.871
You have tubes in your face.

35:05.904 --> 35:07.706
You know what
my father would've done

35:07.739 --> 35:09.141
if I talked to him like that?

35:09.175 --> 35:11.177
He probably would've said,

35:11.210 --> 35:12.878
"Thank you for
saving my life, son."

35:12.911 --> 35:14.380
(laughing):
Yeah, probably.

35:14.413 --> 35:15.614
My father was a saint.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.549
(both laugh)

35:17.583 --> 35:19.918
Now, hey...
get out of here.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.488
And get yourself
something to eat,

35:22.521 --> 35:23.922
something decent to eat.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.157
The food here is garbage.

35:25.191 --> 35:26.792
I will, in a bit.

35:26.825 --> 35:28.927
I'm not in a hurry.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.163
(TV plays indistinctly)

35:31.963 --> 35:33.432
I love you, you know.

35:34.633 --> 35:35.834
Almost as much
as Sinatra,

35:35.867 --> 35:37.703
and he's a damned good bird.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.208
(chuckles)
Oh, no, no, no.

35:42.241 --> 35:43.275
Change that. No, no.
I don't...

35:43.309 --> 35:45.244
The beach volleyball, come on.

35:45.277 --> 35:46.778
I don't need...
Oh, look at, look at that.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.180
La, la, la, la.
Oh, Brazil!

35:48.214 --> 35:49.815
La, la, la, la.
Oh, go, baby, go.

35:52.351 --> 35:54.320
You can make it, you can
make it, you can make it...

35:54.353 --> 35:55.821
PAULA:
You can do it, baby.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.323
You can make it.
Just don't think about it.

35:57.356 --> 35:58.957
Oh, thank God...

35:58.990 --> 36:01.560
Oh... oh...

36:02.894 --> 36:04.496
Paula, come on.

36:04.530 --> 36:05.764
Enough with that.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.339
So, this is
our first Thanksgiving

36:13.372 --> 36:14.940
without Aunt Judy.

36:14.973 --> 36:17.343
Let's, uh...

36:17.376 --> 36:20.346
have a moment
of silence for her.

36:20.379 --> 36:22.514
REBECCA:
Why...?

36:22.548 --> 36:24.350
Because she's dead.

36:24.383 --> 36:26.718
(snoring)

36:29.788 --> 36:31.890
(knocking at door)

36:31.923 --> 36:33.292
Hey, Paula!

36:33.325 --> 36:34.560
Come in.
(door opens)

36:34.593 --> 36:36.228
Oh, I think my spleen
is somewhere

36:36.262 --> 36:38.497
in the municipal sewer system.

36:38.530 --> 36:39.931
(door closes)

36:39.965 --> 36:41.867
Oh...

36:41.900 --> 36:45.737
Oh... my butthole's
the gateway to hell.

36:45.771 --> 36:47.606
(moaning)

36:47.639 --> 36:49.541
You look great.
Hi!

36:49.575 --> 36:50.909
What are you
doing here?

36:50.942 --> 36:52.578
You promised me a drink.

36:52.611 --> 36:53.812
I got tired of waiting.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.647
Okay. So you just showed up?

36:55.681 --> 36:57.616
And, like, phones don't exist?

36:57.649 --> 36:59.585
I decided we're past courtesy.

36:59.618 --> 37:00.986
I brought

37:01.019 --> 37:02.654
tacos and tequila,

37:02.688 --> 37:04.823
the food of
our forefathers.

37:04.856 --> 37:07.259
Well, not really yours.
Or mine.

37:07.293 --> 37:08.994
That's really nice.

37:09.027 --> 37:11.830
But, God, I'm not really
in a position

37:11.863 --> 37:13.031
to eat that stuff right now.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.633
I've had the worst
Thanksgiving ever.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.335
Yeah, mine was really bad, too.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.737
It was like Pearl Harbor
meets the movie Pearl Harbor.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.872
(laughs)
That's funny.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.040
Well, feel free

37:22.073 --> 37:24.310
to sit down,
but I gotta warn you,

37:24.343 --> 37:25.544
I'm not good company.

37:25.577 --> 37:26.678
That's okay. I'm used to it.

37:26.712 --> 37:29.047
Ha, ha, ha!
(laughs evilly)

37:29.080 --> 37:30.816
You know what? Maybe I will
have some tequila.

37:30.849 --> 37:32.050
Yeah.
(stomach gurgling)

37:32.083 --> 37:34.052
Oh, no, no, no.
Not tacos, though.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.855
Not gonna handle
those tacos right now.

37:36.888 --> 37:38.724
Here, let me get you a plate
to eat the tacos on,

37:38.757 --> 37:40.426
because you're a person.

37:40.459 --> 37:41.693
(stomach gurgling)

37:41.727 --> 37:43.895
Uh-oh. Oh, God.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.531
Oh, no...

37:45.564 --> 37:47.833
Where are you... going?
Okay, okay, okay.

37:47.866 --> 37:50.068
I'll be back, I'll be back.
Clench, Becky. Clench, Becky.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.770
You can do it.
Okay.

37:51.803 --> 37:54.306
Okay, Becky.

37:54.340 --> 37:56.041
(door closes)

38:02.047 --> 38:03.615
Let's see what's on my queue.

38:03.649 --> 38:04.850
No.

38:04.883 --> 38:06.718
Mm-- no. Sorry you
had to see that.

38:06.752 --> 38:09.688
Ooh! Documentary about a whale
that didn't have parents.

38:09.721 --> 38:11.357
Mm. Mm-hmm.

38:11.390 --> 38:12.591
That says Thanksgiving.

38:13.992 --> 38:17.062
So... how'd your dad
take the news?

38:18.930 --> 38:20.366
Oh, yeah, that didn't happen.

38:20.399 --> 38:22.501
Really? He asked you to stay?

38:22.534 --> 38:24.736
Nah, it's just...

38:24.770 --> 38:26.905
The thing is,

38:26.938 --> 38:29.040
he's always been there for me,

38:29.074 --> 38:31.977
my whole life.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.613
The only person, actually.

38:35.847 --> 38:37.549
God...

38:37.583 --> 38:40.419
it's nice that
you have that.

38:40.452 --> 38:42.854
'Cause not everyone does.

38:42.888 --> 38:45.557
That whale didn't.

38:45.591 --> 38:47.593
No.
(chuckles)

38:47.626 --> 38:48.860
Have you thought
about night school?

38:48.894 --> 38:51.430
Yeah. It's funny
you say that.

38:51.463 --> 38:52.864
I have been thinking about it.

38:52.898 --> 38:54.600
Do it!

38:54.633 --> 38:57.536
Maybe I will.

38:57.569 --> 38:58.904
Okay.

38:58.937 --> 39:01.006
Why does Netflix
always want me

39:01.039 --> 39:02.841
to watch Leaving Las Vegas?

39:02.874 --> 39:04.910
What are they trying to tell me?

39:04.943 --> 39:06.445
(gasps) Wait.

39:06.478 --> 39:08.514
I know exactly
what we should watch.

39:08.547 --> 39:10.916
(clicking)

39:10.949 --> 39:13.585
There. I saved
you the pork adobo

39:13.619 --> 39:15.153
and the turkey
skin, Anak.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.688
Thanks, Mom.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.457
Hey, that was
a great sermon, huh?

39:18.490 --> 39:20.926
Perfect combination
of guilt and...

39:20.959 --> 39:23.395
No, I guess
it was just guilt.

39:23.429 --> 39:24.530
VALENCIA:
I wasn't even paying attention.

39:24.563 --> 39:26.932
I was just... so happy.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.500
(giggling)

39:28.534 --> 39:30.636
(both laughing)
I'm going to bed.

39:30.669 --> 39:32.504
All I ask is

39:32.538 --> 39:35.841
if you're going to go against
the church and live in sin,

39:35.874 --> 39:38.777
be consistent
and use contraception, okay?

39:38.810 --> 39:40.446
(sighs)

39:40.479 --> 39:41.513
(humming)

39:41.547 --> 39:44.516
Thanks, Mom.
Good night.

39:44.550 --> 39:46.885
You want to hear
something funny?

39:46.918 --> 39:49.421
You want to know who
I'm most thankful for today?

39:50.556 --> 39:51.790
Rebecca.

39:51.823 --> 39:53.625
What? Why?

39:53.659 --> 39:56.562
But don't get me wrong.
She's the worst and I hate her.

39:56.595 --> 39:58.497
But if it wasn't
for us fighting about her,

39:58.530 --> 40:00.566
we wouldn't be moving in
together!

40:00.599 --> 40:01.833
(both laughing)

40:01.867 --> 40:04.736
So, which part of town
should we live in?

40:04.770 --> 40:07.606
Uh, I haven't thought
about it yet.
Well, I have,

40:07.639 --> 40:10.075
because I have my eye on
a duplex on South Cameron

40:10.108 --> 40:11.977
with a backyard
and shutters

40:12.010 --> 40:16.214
and French doors and Spanish
tile and an orange tree.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.517
It has two bedrooms,
which would be perfect,

40:18.550 --> 40:21.720
because I need the extra room
to practice my Ashtanga.

40:24.255 --> 40:27.859
REBECCA (sighs):
The World Dog Awards.

40:27.893 --> 40:30.095
(barking on TV)
Now that says
Thanksgiving.

40:30.128 --> 40:32.531
I hate to say it,
but that bloodhound

40:32.564 --> 40:34.633
could definitely benefit
from a juice cleanse.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.167
Mm-hmm, yeah.
Whoa.

40:36.201 --> 40:38.470
Yes, that is one portly puppy.

40:38.504 --> 40:39.671
Mm.

40:39.705 --> 40:41.773
Oh, here.

40:44.042 --> 40:45.611
Here you go.

40:45.644 --> 40:47.713
No one likes a hot butt.
(barking on TV)

40:49.047 --> 40:51.650
Hmm.

40:53.151 --> 40:55.554
Oh, my God, I can't believe
I'm eating again.

40:55.587 --> 40:57.723
Yeah, I was gonna say,
speaking of portly puppies.

40:57.756 --> 40:59.758
Woof! Woof!
That's not nice.
That's not nice.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.793
Woof! Woof! Woof!
You've lost
your pillow privileges.

41:01.827 --> 41:03.762
Ooh, ooh, giant pillow!
No! That's unfair!

41:03.795 --> 41:06.097
(Greg laughing)

41:06.131 --> 41:08.133
Oh.

41:08.900 --> 41:12.704
No! Not Greg. Josh! Josh!

41:12.738 --> 41:14.573
(sighs)

41:14.606 --> 41:17.142
I worked so hard for nothing!

41:17.175 --> 41:19.144
GIRL:
 Another story, Miss Rebecca.

41:19.177 --> 41:22.113
'Twas the night
of the Dunster House Formal.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.215
The place? Harvard.

41:24.249 --> 41:27.719
The year? 2008.

41:27.753 --> 41:29.521
I remember it
specifically

41:29.555 --> 41:30.956
because I had
a Barack Obama bobblehead

41:30.989 --> 41:32.524
perched on my nightstand.

41:32.558 --> 41:34.059
And as I was being
rhythmically trashed

41:34.092 --> 41:36.762
by a junior visiting
from the Brown improv troupe,

41:36.795 --> 41:39.631
the bobblehead nodded
up and down as if to say,

41:39.665 --> 41:42.300
"Yes, yes, you have made
another terrible decision,

41:42.333 --> 41:44.002
you silly, weak woman."

41:44.035 --> 41:48.607
(shrieking):
Mommy!
I was out of stories!
