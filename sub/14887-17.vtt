Which tie do you think
goes best with this shirt?

01:35.825 --> 01:37.762
I think this one.

‐ Oh, hi!

01:55.463 --> 01:56.498
Hi.

01:56.533 --> 01:59.038
We just got a last minute flight
assignment to Paris

01:59.071 --> 02:00.273
and we need a little favor.

02:00.306 --> 02:01.108
Name it.

02:01.142 --> 02:02.879
Could you let the plumber
in tomorrow.

02:02.912 --> 02:04.983
He's gonna put on
that new shower head we bought.

02:05.016 --> 02:07.822
Hey, consider it done.

02:07.856 --> 02:08.791
Here's the plumber's
phone number.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.728
Now, you'll have to call
him to confirm a time.

02:10.762 --> 02:12.397
Don't worry.

02:12.430 --> 02:14.368
I'll handle everything.

02:16.907 --> 02:19.278
Well, thanks, guys. We've got
to run. There's a cab waiting.

02:19.880 --> 02:20.848
Bye‐bye.

02:23.888 --> 02:25.825
I'll call the plumber.

[phone pad clanking]

02:30.033 --> 02:32.404
Hello, is this, uh,
Pipe Dreams Plumbing?

02:33.774 --> 02:36.045
Yes, I'm calling on behalf
of Ms. Jennifer Lyons.

02:37.515 --> 02:39.686
Uh, yes. I'd like to cancel
that appointment.

02:41.155 --> 02:43.794
No, I'm going
to be doing it myself.

02:46.398 --> 02:49.371
No, you can't invite
all your friends over to watch.

02:53.112 --> 02:54.081
Jerk.

02:55.985 --> 02:58.489
Uh... cousin, I...

02:58.523 --> 03:01.964
I'm sure I'm wrong, but I could
have sworn that I heard

03:01.997 --> 03:03.667
you call and cancel the plumber.

03:03.701 --> 03:05.403
‐ I did.
‐ I see.

03:05.436 --> 03:09.679
Well...I‐I'm very sure I'm wrong

03:09.713 --> 03:13.152
but I could have sworn that
I heard you tell the plumber

03:13.186 --> 03:15.557
that you were going to put on
the shower head yourself.

03:15.591 --> 03:17.561
‐ I am.
‐ I see.

03:18.898 --> 03:20.768
Well, in that case...

03:20.802 --> 03:23.172
...may I invite my friends
over to watch?

03:25.577 --> 03:27.816
Because when it comes
to plumbing

03:27.849 --> 03:29.853
you don't know Bo Diddly.

Balki, this has nothing
to do with plumbing.

03:36.666 --> 03:38.838
Jennifer wasn't asking me
to call a plumber.

03:38.871 --> 03:41.844
She was asking me
to come to her rescue.

03:43.012 --> 03:46.485
I could've sworn
she asked you to call a plumber.

03:46.519 --> 03:51.162
Those were her words, but her
eyes was saying "Help me."

03:55.704 --> 03:58.209
No, I think her eyes was saying

03:58.242 --> 04:00.180
"Call the plumber".

04:03.653 --> 04:06.025
Balki, Balki, Balki.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.000
It's what women do.

04:11.636 --> 04:12.872
They pretend to be helpless

04:12.906 --> 04:15.677
so their man
can come to the rescue.

04:16.914 --> 04:19.719
When Jennifer gets back
and finds out her man

04:19.752 --> 04:20.954
has handled it

a can of WD‐40?

05:59.251 --> 06:00.186
Eh...

06:01.488 --> 06:05.196
Cousin, I, I hope you'll accept

06:05.230 --> 06:08.136
this in the spirit
in which it's given

06:08.169 --> 06:10.440
but as far as I can see

06:10.473 --> 06:14.916
you seem to have absolutely
no idea what you are doing.

06:17.454 --> 06:19.324
What are you talking about?

06:19.358 --> 06:22.230
I think you are doing it
completely wrong.

‐ Oh, you do?
‐ Yes, I do.

06:30.280 --> 06:33.820
Balki, how many showers
are there on Mypos?

06:35.323 --> 06:37.060
None. It's an island.

06:39.364 --> 06:42.337
And how many shower heads
have you replaced?

06:42.370 --> 06:43.439

‐ How many?

have you replaced?

06:48.349 --> 06:50.220
‐ None.
‐ None, as in zero?

06:50.253 --> 06:53.059
As in never, ever have you
replaced a shower head?

06:53.092 --> 06:54.394
‐ That is correct.
‐ I see.

06:54.428 --> 06:57.034
And yet, you're telling me,
someone who's been around

06:57.067 --> 06:59.973
showers for over a quarter
of a century...

07:01.609 --> 07:04.281
...that I am doing it wrong?

07:04.314 --> 07:05.884
That is correct.

07:07.521 --> 07:09.592
Well, perhaps you'd like
to tell me the right way.

07:09.625 --> 07:10.927
‐ Yes, I would.
‐ Would you?

07:10.962 --> 07:11.796
‐ Yes, I would. I would.
‐ Would you?

07:11.829 --> 07:15.671
‐ What is the right way?
‐ I don't know.

07:15.704 --> 07:19.411
But I just know
you're doing it the wrong way.

07:20.948 --> 07:22.885

the directions say?

07:23.386 --> 07:24.354
Directions?

07:27.194 --> 07:29.364
I threw them out.

through his whole life

07:31.335 --> 07:34.308
without ever reading
a set of directions.

without directions.

07:38.282 --> 07:40.253
Isn't that the house
that burned to the ground?

07:43.593 --> 07:45.564
They never proved
it was the wiring.

to be a friend

07:51.175 --> 07:54.515

there and insult my family?

what you want me to do?

08:00.393 --> 08:02.297

to as the plumber's helper.

American ingenuity

‐ Hi.

But, uh... this is
a California wine.

they said it was imported.

Larry, thanks for letting
the plumber in.

That shower massage
felt great after a long flight.

It wasn't the plumber who eased

16:09.237 --> 16:11.407
those sore aching muscles,
Jennifer.

the shower head myself.

Well, whatever.

No need to take notes.

to adjust to the time zone

16:35.222 --> 16:37.193

with gratitude.

on the old monkey wrench again.

16:50.654 --> 16:52.625
I forgot how much I enjoyed it.

16:54.729 --> 16:56.666
Well, I'm happy for you, Larry.

16:58.837 --> 17:00.841
Listen, I hope we didn't
make too much

17:00.874 --> 17:02.476
of a mess up in your bathroom?

17:02.510 --> 17:05.516
Well, how much of a mess can
you make changing a shower head?

17:09.759 --> 17:11.829
Oh, you‐you'd be surprised.

17:13.900 --> 17:17.439
What Balki means is that even
the simplest of home repairs

17:17.473 --> 17:19.679
can be tough, if someone
doesn't know what he's doing.

17:19.712 --> 17:22.083
Take it from Cousin Larry.
Ha ha!

17:24.655 --> 17:26.759
Well, it must give you a real
sense of security knowing

17:26.792 --> 17:29.665
there's a man around
in case there's a crisis.

17:30.533 --> 17:32.504
Or in case you want a crisis.

17:36.746 --> 17:38.650
‐ Balki?
‐ Yes?

17:38.683 --> 17:41.387
Don't you think
you should pour the wine?

17:41.421 --> 17:42.423
Good idea, cousin.

17:42.456 --> 17:44.427
Better me than you.

17:45.597 --> 17:47.299
Ha ha ha ha.

17:50.506 --> 17:52.343
You know, it's weird.

17:52.376 --> 17:53.378
I could have sworn when we left

17:53.411 --> 17:56.417
our bathroom tile was green
and now it's blue.

17:58.923 --> 18:01.729
Well, sometimes, uh,
even the simplest thing

18:01.763 --> 18:04.534
like a new shower head
can change

18:04.568 --> 18:06.639
the whole look of a bathroom.

18:08.408 --> 18:12.183
[Jennifer]
It looks great. Of course, now
I do have to buy new towels.

18:12.785 --> 18:14.889
[Larry]
If there's anything else you
need done around the apartment

18:14.922 --> 18:17.426
uh, feel free to call on me.

18:17.459 --> 18:19.699
Cousin.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.469
[Larry]
You know, I've always
been good with my hands.

18:22.504 --> 18:24.273
My dad taught me
all about home repair.

18:25.611 --> 18:26.846
[Larry]
Did I ever tell you
about the time

18:26.879 --> 18:29.819
my dad rewired
our entire house

18:29.852 --> 18:32.489
without a set of directions?

18:32.524 --> 18:34.460
‐ Uh... cousin.
‐ The man was a genius.

18:35.596 --> 18:37.735
Balki, I'm in the middle
of a story.

18:38.035 --> 18:39.470
Um...

18:41.007 --> 18:42.009
Oh.

18:42.745 --> 18:44.380
Thank you.

18:44.413 --> 18:46.417
There you go, Mary Anne.

18:46.451 --> 18:47.419
And...

18:54.835 --> 18:55.804
Ooh.

19:07.393 --> 19:08.495
Lovely rose.

19:09.732 --> 19:12.537
Funny, it wasn't rose
when I bought it.

19:13.038 --> 19:15.409
Um... cousin.

19:15.442 --> 19:19.383
We... seem to have sprung
a little leak.

19:19.417 --> 19:20.754
Oh, my goodness.

19:20.787 --> 19:22.557
Oh, alright, uh...
Don't‐don't worry.

19:22.590 --> 19:24.895
No need to panic.

19:24.929 --> 19:27.667
Well, shouldn't we call
the landlord?

19:34.982 --> 19:35.951
There.

19:36.919 --> 19:39.792
Whatever it was, it stopped.

19:39.825 --> 19:41.729
Now, come on.

19:41.763 --> 19:46.572
Let's not let a leaky roof
ruin a beautiful evening.

19:49.745 --> 19:53.385
Remember, into every life,
a little rain must fall.

20:09.985 --> 20:12.189
Isn't our bathroom
right up there?

20:40.881 --> 20:43.820
[instrumental music]

20:49.030 --> 20:52.269
Well, that depends on what you
plumbers consider an emergency.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.811
Did you see
"The Poseidon Adventure?"

21:00.620 --> 21:02.256
Larry, I still don't understand

21:02.289 --> 21:04.628
why you tried
to fix it yourself.

21:04.661 --> 21:07.233
I thought
that's what you wanted.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.538
I just wanted you
to call the plumber.

21:10.673 --> 21:12.544
It seemed so simple.

21:15.851 --> 21:18.890
Cousin,
the plumber's on his way.

21:18.923 --> 21:22.063
He said have your
checkbook ready...

21:23.198 --> 21:26.137
...plus any CDs
that might have matured.

21:31.214 --> 21:33.920
Come on, Jennifer. We better
go upstairs and wait for him.

21:33.953 --> 21:35.089
Bye.

21:35.122 --> 21:37.026
‐ Bye.
‐ Bye‐bye.

21:46.177 --> 21:48.215
Balki, why...

21:48.248 --> 21:50.252
Why do I do this?

21:51.254 --> 21:52.925
I mean, why didn't I just...

21:52.958 --> 21:55.195
...call the plumber
in the first place?

21:55.229 --> 21:57.366
‐ Well, cousin, you know‐‐
‐ Or after the pipe broke.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.337
‐ Well‐‐
‐ Why didn't I realize it?

21:59.370 --> 22:02.309
‐ Well, because‐‐
‐ Or after the toilet exploded?

22:03.947 --> 22:05.851
I mean, what does it take?

22:05.884 --> 22:08.321
What is the matter?
What is wrong with me?

22:08.355 --> 22:11.027
Well, cousin, you know,
part of the problem is you tend

22:11.061 --> 22:13.331
to ask questions and then not
wait for the answers.

22:16.471 --> 22:20.379
Balki, how did I
let things go so far?

22:20.412 --> 22:24.855
Well, you know, cousin,
you sometimes get an idea

22:24.889 --> 22:27.193
in your head, and then you
just won't let it go.

22:27.226 --> 22:30.232
You remind me of this dog
I used to know on Mypos.

22:32.169 --> 22:34.841
He was always chasing
his tail and then...

22:34.875 --> 22:37.948
...one day he caught it and...

22:37.981 --> 22:39.851
...spun himself to death.

22:45.029 --> 22:46.999
It wasn't a pretty sight.

22:52.043 --> 22:55.282
Well, I guess I do get

22:55.315 --> 22:58.288
carried away sometimes.

23:01.427 --> 23:04.300
I just thought that‐that
if I could do it myself

23:04.333 --> 23:06.505
Jennifer would be impressed.

23:06.538 --> 23:09.277
Cousin, listen.

23:09.310 --> 23:11.983
Jennifer likes you
for what you are

23:12.016 --> 23:14.487
and you want her to like you
for what you are not.

23:16.124 --> 23:19.263
Well, I figured if she thought
I was a macho...

23:19.297 --> 23:22.069
...handy take‐charge
kind of guy

23:22.103 --> 23:24.407
she'd like me even more.

23:24.440 --> 23:25.676
Cousin, listen to me.

23:25.710 --> 23:29.584
Jennifer doesn't want a macho,
handy take‐charge kind of guy.

23:29.618 --> 23:31.287
She wants you.

23:34.493 --> 23:37.466

23:44.581 --> 23:47.186
