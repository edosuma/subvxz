WEBVTT

00:38.916 --> 00:39.958
Here, I'll help.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.166
Take it slow.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.083
Do you feel better?

00:50.166 --> 00:52.000
You passed out in my clinic.

00:54.791 --> 00:57.125
You stayed here to take care of me?

00:57.708 --> 00:58.708
Of course.

00:58.791 --> 01:01.583
There's no way a doctor
would abandon his patient.

01:03.708 --> 01:04.583
By the way,

01:04.666 --> 01:07.583
you left the hospital's number
as your emergency contact.

01:08.125 --> 01:09.250
I didn't know who to call.

01:09.333 --> 01:11.458
Should I call your family?

01:12.375 --> 01:13.458
It's okay.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.458
I don't want anyone to worry.

01:17.500 --> 01:18.458
Okay.

01:25.208 --> 01:29.833
FOR YOUR HAPPINESS

01:32.916 --> 01:34.750
<i>I will be home late tonight.</i>

01:34.833 --> 01:35.916
<i>You should do your homework.</i>

01:38.416 --> 01:40.833
<i>Okay! Take care.</i>

02:19.666 --> 02:20.708
An Yi-chi!

02:24.791 --> 02:25.958
Po-han?

02:26.041 --> 02:27.333
What are you doing here?

02:27.416 --> 02:29.083
Are you working part-time
without the company knowing?

02:30.625 --> 02:33.583
There's no rule that says employees
can't take jobs during their own time.

02:34.166 --> 02:35.833
I need to get going on this order.
See you.

02:38.583 --> 02:41.666
So you got a photographer
for A-Lin's album cover shoot?

02:41.750 --> 02:43.416
Don't forget,

02:43.500 --> 02:45.666
A-Lin isn't the only singer
at our company.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.375
Did you get the song
for the Backbone Brothers?

02:48.958 --> 02:50.166
You didn't get anything done.

02:50.666 --> 02:51.750
And now you're working another job?

02:52.458 --> 02:54.375
I'll do everything on time.

02:54.458 --> 02:55.625
I'm not at work now.

02:55.708 --> 02:57.375
I'm going to be late for this delivery.

02:57.458 --> 02:58.916
I really need this part-time job.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
See you.

03:01.750 --> 03:03.458
I'll let you finish this last delivery.

03:03.541 --> 03:05.041
No more orders.

03:05.625 --> 03:07.000
I'll wait for you at your door.

03:10.166 --> 03:11.208
Go.

03:12.291 --> 03:13.416
Bye.

03:36.333 --> 03:39.083
Are you working a part-time job
because of your son?

03:40.375 --> 03:41.250
Yes.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.875
I didn't know this surgery
would be so expensive.

03:45.541 --> 03:48.125
I told you
to let me know if you need anything.

03:49.041 --> 03:50.625
I won't be able to pay you back.

03:51.125 --> 03:52.291
I don't like being in debt.

03:53.208 --> 03:54.541
What about his dad?

03:57.291 --> 04:00.000
He didn't know I had Ke-le.

04:01.250 --> 04:03.125
I got pregnant when I was in college.

04:03.208 --> 04:05.458
He didn't want me to keep the child.

04:06.125 --> 04:07.583
But I couldn't give up Ke-le.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.791
So I lied and said I got an abortion.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.666
I never contacted him again.

04:15.666 --> 04:17.333
We were too young back then.

04:17.833 --> 04:19.708
I don't blame him.

04:20.916 --> 04:22.083
I just

04:22.666 --> 04:25.125
didn't expect that Ke-le's health…

04:34.541 --> 04:36.000
You haven't eaten yet, right?

04:38.541 --> 04:40.458
I bought something for Ke-le too.

04:41.625 --> 04:44.708
Gosh. There's a lot in here.

04:46.291 --> 04:47.625
Want to share?

04:55.958 --> 04:57.083
Ke-le, I'm home.

04:57.166 --> 04:59.083
I have sushi, it's your favorite.

05:00.291 --> 05:01.958
An Yi-chi, look. I folded the clothes.

05:03.291 --> 05:05.750
Goodness, you're such a good boy.

05:09.041 --> 05:10.750
What are you doing here?

05:12.458 --> 05:13.750
You should call him Mr. Wang.

05:13.833 --> 05:14.791
Don't be rude.

05:15.375 --> 05:16.666
Hi, Mr. Wang.

05:17.833 --> 05:19.291
Okay, take this in there.

05:19.375 --> 05:21.541
-Wash your hands and get the plates.
-Okay.

05:24.166 --> 05:25.458
Come on in.

05:43.583 --> 05:45.666
An Ke-le, this one is so good!

05:45.750 --> 05:46.666
Try it.

05:46.750 --> 05:48.916
It's so sweet. Go on.

05:50.208 --> 05:51.250
I'm used to it.

05:51.833 --> 05:53.125
She's like this when she's super hungry.

06:06.666 --> 06:07.750
I'm so full!

06:09.333 --> 06:10.416
An Ke-le!

06:10.500 --> 06:11.875
That's rude.

06:11.958 --> 06:13.166
It's not funny.

06:13.875 --> 06:16.166
Hey, give me your phone.

06:16.791 --> 06:17.708
Why?

06:18.541 --> 06:20.666
Your mom is going to be busy with work.

06:20.750 --> 06:21.958
If you can't find her,

06:22.041 --> 06:23.416
you can text me.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.500
You don't need to do that. It's fine.

06:25.583 --> 06:28.083
I've already made an exception
for you to work part-time.

06:28.166 --> 06:29.666
I don't want to be the last one to know

06:29.750 --> 06:31.208
if anything happens.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.291
Okay.

06:32.375 --> 06:33.541
Give me your phone.

06:34.791 --> 06:35.750
Come on.

06:48.958 --> 06:50.625
Don't bother Mr. Wang for no reason.

06:51.208 --> 06:52.500
He shouldn't bother me.

06:53.875 --> 06:55.875
I'll get going.
Don't be late for work tomorrow.

06:55.958 --> 06:56.958
Okay.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.666
Don't bother your mom when she's working.

07:04.250 --> 07:05.375
Call me if you need anything.

07:06.625 --> 07:07.875
See you.

07:08.375 --> 07:09.291
Bye.

07:12.541 --> 07:13.541
He's rude.

07:13.625 --> 07:15.583
He didn't even say goodbye.

07:16.916 --> 07:19.125
Mr. Wang is a good person.

07:36.458 --> 07:37.500
Hey.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.500
Do you have anything to say to me?

07:45.958 --> 07:47.416
Do you want an egg in your noodles?

07:47.500 --> 07:48.500
Sure.

07:49.208 --> 07:50.250
Okay.

07:52.250 --> 07:53.833
That's not what I mean.

07:54.416 --> 07:55.541
I mean like

07:55.625 --> 07:59.333
the kind of confession
you would tell the priest at church.

08:00.541 --> 08:01.791
You're not a priest.

08:03.875 --> 08:06.833
I'm in a bad mood today.
Just tell me something.

08:11.083 --> 08:12.083
Okay.

08:14.666 --> 08:16.666
I hope that…

08:22.625 --> 08:24.625
you'll find a good man

08:26.791 --> 08:27.958
and get married soon.

08:29.458 --> 08:30.791
You can marry me then.

08:36.375 --> 08:38.583
I'm not a good man.

08:40.166 --> 08:42.083
What makes a man a good man?

08:50.416 --> 08:51.583
He has to have a job.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.250
He cooks delicious food for you.

08:56.208 --> 08:57.375
He's kind.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.333
He takes care of his family.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.250
And…

09:10.000 --> 09:11.208
He's healthy.

09:14.916 --> 09:16.833
There's no such person.

09:18.250 --> 09:19.375
There is.

09:20.208 --> 09:21.583
I happen to know one.

09:31.416 --> 09:32.500
Yang Yu-hsien!

09:33.000 --> 09:34.583
What?

09:34.666 --> 09:36.375
Remember that interview I did as a nominee

09:36.458 --> 09:37.791
-of M&L International Photographer Awards?
-Yes.

09:37.875 --> 09:39.500
I didn't expect

09:39.583 --> 09:41.958
that they'd give me two pages!

09:42.041 --> 09:43.833
Gosh!

09:43.916 --> 09:45.083
The photo's huge, right?

09:45.166 --> 09:46.500
The bigger, the better!

09:49.791 --> 09:50.958
What are you doing?

09:51.041 --> 09:53.458
I was just thinking
where to hang it on the wall.

09:53.541 --> 09:54.958
Don't do that.

09:55.041 --> 09:57.250
-I just want to brag about my fiancée.
-What if people see it?

09:57.333 --> 09:58.375
So embarrassing.

09:58.458 --> 09:59.750
What's the commotion about?

09:59.833 --> 10:01.125
This is a clinic.

10:01.750 --> 10:02.750
Hello, sir.

10:06.750 --> 10:07.875
Dad.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.291
Cindy's work has been
nominated for an international award.

10:11.791 --> 10:13.916
So she's just a nominee.
What are you so excited about?

10:15.208 --> 10:17.000
M&L is an international
photographer award.

10:17.583 --> 10:18.833
The competition is intense.

10:19.708 --> 10:21.791
It's amazing just to be nominated.

10:21.875 --> 10:23.666
I don't really understand

10:23.750 --> 10:25.833
what is there to be proud of about

10:25.916 --> 10:27.291
doing these useless things.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.208
By the way,

10:31.291 --> 10:32.500
the day after tomorrow at noon.

10:32.583 --> 10:33.750
Don't forget.

10:34.750 --> 10:35.625
Dad…

10:40.416 --> 10:41.291
It's okay.

10:44.833 --> 10:46.166
What are you doing the day after tomorrow?

10:48.125 --> 10:49.083
Well…

10:50.125 --> 10:51.750
It's just a lunch thing.

12:36.166 --> 12:37.125
I see.

13:02.791 --> 13:04.666
I thought you were at the M&L Awards.

13:04.750 --> 13:05.958
How was it?

13:07.500 --> 13:08.708
BEER

13:08.791 --> 13:10.000
It was just socializing,

13:10.875 --> 13:12.458
putting on a smile,

13:13.083 --> 13:14.500
and watching them give out awards.

13:22.708 --> 13:24.208
Don't be sad.

13:25.083 --> 13:27.166
I'm off this Friday. Let's go out.

13:29.708 --> 13:31.500
There's always a next time.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.708
I knew you could do it.

14:01.916 --> 14:03.666
What is there to be proud of about

14:03.750 --> 14:04.791
doing these useless things?

14:06.333 --> 14:08.833
When you become famous,
no one would dare to do this to you.

14:14.708 --> 14:16.750
How was your lunch today?

14:19.500 --> 14:20.666
Lunch?

14:21.250 --> 14:22.541
It was nothing.

14:22.625 --> 14:24.000
Just a regular meeting.

14:25.375 --> 14:26.541
Who was it with?

14:32.250 --> 14:34.750
Just some of my graduate school friends.

14:57.750 --> 14:59.458
PING HE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL

14:59.541 --> 15:01.416
<i>Still no suitable bone marrow?</i>

15:01.500 --> 15:03.291
Not yet.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.125
Cream still doesn't know?

15:11.625 --> 15:12.916
If she knew,

15:13.000 --> 15:14.291
she would cause a big scene.

15:15.833 --> 15:17.291
I was just wondering

15:17.875 --> 15:19.250
when I'm gone,

15:19.333 --> 15:20.708
who will take care of her?

15:21.750 --> 15:24.000
You're still thinking of other people?

15:39.250 --> 15:41.666
CHEN YI-TE

15:41.750 --> 15:44.875
YANG YU-HSIEN

16:00.375 --> 16:02.125
Why are you staring at me like that?

16:03.458 --> 16:05.375
It's not time for our appointment yet.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.208
I know.

16:07.291 --> 16:09.333
Thank you for taking me
to the hospital last time.

16:09.416 --> 16:10.958
My company is having a party.

16:11.041 --> 16:12.750
I'd like to invite you to join us.

16:16.583 --> 16:17.958
See you there.

16:26.083 --> 16:28.166
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

16:28.250 --> 16:30.875
Where are Mr. Chi and Bonnie?
Why are they not here?

16:31.750 --> 16:33.541
They're probably still getting dressed up.

16:36.125 --> 16:39.291
Hey, why aren't
we wearing matching shirts?

16:39.375 --> 16:40.875
We're not a couple.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.416
You can be a pumpkin for Halloween,

16:42.500 --> 16:44.125
but that doesn't mean you're a pumpkin.

16:49.750 --> 16:50.583
Dr. Yang!

16:50.666 --> 16:52.083
You didn't tell me you were here already.

16:52.666 --> 16:54.541
I didn't see you when I got here.
So I just came in.

16:55.500 --> 16:56.333
I'm sorry.

16:56.416 --> 16:57.416
Let me introduce you.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.375
This is Sung Yuan-yuan. She's my friend.

16:59.458 --> 17:00.500
She's also a lyricist.

17:00.583 --> 17:02.750
You mean genius and beautiful lyricist.

17:02.833 --> 17:03.916
Hello.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.166
Hello, I'm Yang Yu-hsien.

17:06.083 --> 17:07.375
I know.

17:07.458 --> 17:08.791
-You're K's dentist, right?
-Yes.

17:08.875 --> 17:10.041
I hope he's not a lot of trouble.

17:10.125 --> 17:11.500
No, he's a very good patient.

17:12.333 --> 17:14.833
You guys can chat.
I'm going to go talk to some friends.

17:15.416 --> 17:17.083
Take good care of Dr. Yang for me. Okay?

17:17.166 --> 17:18.000
Okay.

17:18.541 --> 17:19.375
Bye.

17:55.666 --> 17:57.958
You can come to our clinic
for a checkup first.

17:58.041 --> 17:59.541
There are different kinds
of teeth whitening procedures

17:59.625 --> 18:00.916
like cold-light bleaching treatment
or home kits.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.875
For home kits,
we'll give you a set of products.

18:02.958 --> 18:03.958
Before you go to bed,

18:04.041 --> 18:06.125
just put the paste on the whitening tray

18:06.208 --> 18:07.583
and put it on…

18:15.833 --> 18:16.833
Which part did you drink from?

18:17.541 --> 18:19.541
This isn't an indirect kiss, right?

19:44.416 --> 19:45.958
Where did you go last night?

19:46.041 --> 19:47.583
We couldn't find you anywhere.

19:47.666 --> 19:49.333
I was hungry so I got some food.

19:52.833 --> 19:54.125
We?

19:55.125 --> 19:57.083
You're that close to him already?

19:57.958 --> 19:59.375
You weren't there.

19:59.458 --> 20:01.250
Who else would I hang out with?

20:01.875 --> 20:03.750
Last night, Catgirl got super drunk.

20:03.833 --> 20:04.958
She was dancing the whole night.

20:05.041 --> 20:06.666
I couldn't even get close to her.

20:11.666 --> 20:12.625
Hey.

20:13.833 --> 20:15.583
Your dentist friend,

20:16.166 --> 20:17.375
is he single?

20:20.333 --> 20:21.666
I don't know.

20:23.250 --> 20:24.125
What?

20:24.666 --> 20:25.708
Are you interested in him?

20:26.833 --> 20:27.916
He's not bad.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.583
He seems honest.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.500
He must be a good man.

20:36.125 --> 20:37.625
Good.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.125
Okay. Almost done.

20:46.541 --> 20:48.083
Okay, rinse your mouth now.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.791
Your teeth are fine. Very good.

20:52.875 --> 20:54.875
As for teeth-whitening,

20:54.958 --> 20:57.750
when you go back to the waiting room,
the nurse will explain it to you.

21:03.083 --> 21:04.541
-Dr. Yang.
-Yes?

21:05.166 --> 21:07.333
This is the second time
we've met this week.

21:07.416 --> 21:08.541
That's right.

21:08.625 --> 21:10.916
The first time we met,

21:11.000 --> 21:12.375
we kissed indirectly.

21:16.125 --> 21:17.750
The second time we met,

21:18.625 --> 21:20.083
you went right into my mouth.

21:23.125 --> 21:25.000
What do you think
will happen on the third time?

21:32.250 --> 21:33.750
Can you do me a favor?

21:44.083 --> 21:46.208
You said you wanted to ask me a favor.

21:47.083 --> 21:48.833
Was the favor to drink with you?

21:52.291 --> 21:54.041
-You know what?
-What?

21:55.958 --> 21:58.458
I once read something online.

21:58.541 --> 21:59.791
It is said that

22:00.791 --> 22:03.458
a lot of men don't speak their minds.

22:03.541 --> 22:06.041
The percentage is much higher than women.

22:07.916 --> 22:09.041
Really?

22:10.125 --> 22:11.083
That's right.

22:11.666 --> 22:14.000
Sometimes, guys who really like you

22:14.583 --> 22:16.208
never admit it.

22:16.958 --> 22:18.041
What?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.750
That's called not speaking your mind?

22:22.708 --> 22:24.041
Well…

22:26.083 --> 22:27.833
Dr. Yang,

22:27.916 --> 22:29.291
do you think I'm pretty?

22:33.875 --> 22:35.916
Have you ever been in love?

22:39.083 --> 22:40.375
I'm engaged.

22:40.458 --> 22:41.958
What kind of woman is she?

22:45.083 --> 22:46.125
She…

22:50.083 --> 22:51.958
She…

22:52.041 --> 22:54.166
She's very sensitive.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.291
A bit like you,

22:57.375 --> 22:59.291
but still different.

23:00.250 --> 23:01.416
She's colder than you.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.250
It's hard to know what she's thinking.

23:07.166 --> 23:10.125
In her heart,
there are many knots I can't undo.

23:15.166 --> 23:17.541
How do you know I'm not like that?

23:20.375 --> 23:23.041
Our lovers are always
the most unique to us.

23:26.375 --> 23:27.875
Let me borrow your ring.

23:29.958 --> 23:30.916
Why?

23:31.833 --> 23:33.125
Give it to me.

23:39.458 --> 23:41.375
When it comes to love,

23:41.875 --> 23:43.875
there are usually only two outcomes.

23:45.125 --> 23:46.541
One is like this.

23:47.916 --> 23:50.666
Both people are deep in love.

23:52.166 --> 23:53.541
The other outcome?

24:04.166 --> 24:06.333
You have to fish yourself out of love.

24:09.125 --> 24:10.458
What if you can't do it?

24:10.541 --> 24:11.708
You'll drown.

24:18.041 --> 24:19.875
You said you wanted to get to know me.

24:22.541 --> 24:23.958
Why me?

24:26.000 --> 24:28.625
If there were answers to love,

24:29.875 --> 24:32.833
there wouldn't be
so many people suffering over it.

24:37.333 --> 24:38.958
Buy me another drink.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.208
What's up?

25:05.291 --> 25:07.375
I'm sleeping here tonight.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.750
You went out drinking with Dr. Yang?

25:15.625 --> 25:16.541
Yes.

25:59.625 --> 26:00.583
Mr. Chi.

26:01.333 --> 26:02.666
This is the information I asked Pang

26:02.750 --> 26:04.583
to get
from my private investigator friend.

26:04.666 --> 26:05.625
Take a look.

26:06.250 --> 26:08.333
I'll pay Pang later.

26:08.916 --> 26:10.250
Don't worry about that.

26:10.333 --> 26:12.791
Just do a good job
on Bonnie's album, okay?

26:12.875 --> 26:14.041
Okay.

26:14.666 --> 26:15.875
This Yang Yu-hsien

26:15.958 --> 26:17.625
graduated top of his class
from dental school.

26:17.708 --> 26:20.166
His dad, Yang Yao-lung, is also a dentist.

26:20.250 --> 26:21.458
But he retired.

26:21.541 --> 26:24.541
So he took over his dad's clinic.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.583
No criminal record.

26:26.666 --> 26:27.916
No bad habits.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.583
Very healthy.

26:29.666 --> 26:31.625
He's a winner in life. Cream of the crop.

26:35.958 --> 26:37.083
Is this his girlfriend?

26:37.166 --> 26:38.833
She looks like a movie star.

26:38.916 --> 26:39.916
She's a photographer?

26:40.416 --> 26:41.625
That's right.

26:41.708 --> 26:43.000
Her name is Cindy.

26:43.083 --> 26:44.333
She's pretty good.

26:44.416 --> 26:45.791
-Good?
-Yes.

26:45.875 --> 26:46.708
Look.

26:50.416 --> 26:51.708
Right…

26:51.791 --> 26:54.583
Maybe for Bonnie's promotional photos,

26:54.666 --> 26:56.166
we can hire this Cindy to help us.

26:56.250 --> 26:57.875
-Okay. I'll arrange it.
-Sure.

27:05.916 --> 27:07.833
Dr. Yang, some mail came for you.

27:08.375 --> 27:10.458
-Who sent it?
-Not sure.

27:10.541 --> 27:13.000
-It only has your name on it.
-Thank you.

27:33.000 --> 27:33.916
All these years,

27:35.041 --> 27:37.166
I've supported you
in becoming a professional photographer.

27:38.375 --> 27:39.583
You won an award,

27:40.291 --> 27:41.541
you held your own exhibition,

27:42.250 --> 27:43.916
you even opened your own studio.

27:44.500 --> 27:47.000
I went against my dad,
just to give you a happy life.

27:47.083 --> 27:48.291
I wanted to give you a home.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.125
And this is what you do to me?

27:51.083 --> 27:52.583
It's not what you think.

27:52.666 --> 27:55.125
I'm not lovers with these men.

27:55.208 --> 27:56.458
What is it then?

27:59.708 --> 28:01.166
Fooling around?

28:02.541 --> 28:05.083
Would you believe me if I said
it's part of my creation process?

28:05.166 --> 28:07.500
Don't use the excuse of "creation"
to cover up your betrayal.

28:09.625 --> 28:11.083
If you won't believe me,

28:11.166 --> 28:13.208
I don't want to explain.

28:15.875 --> 28:18.166
Are you even serious
about our relationship?

28:20.208 --> 28:22.000
All that matters is
I have a clear conscience

28:22.083 --> 28:23.666
in a relationship that I want to cherish.

28:25.208 --> 28:28.125
-That's just an irresponsible remark.
-I need to create!

28:28.208 --> 28:30.541
Create? So you're only with me
because you need to create?

28:37.833 --> 28:39.541
Don't humiliate yourself.

28:49.208 --> 28:51.583
I won't deny what I did.

28:55.375 --> 28:58.583
If you want me to apologize,
I can tell you that I'm sorry.

29:02.416 --> 29:04.125
Can you trust me?

29:04.208 --> 29:05.416
I really do

29:05.500 --> 29:07.541
cherish our relationship.

29:10.166 --> 29:11.833
Can you trust me?

29:14.250 --> 29:16.291
I wanted to grow old with you.

29:21.500 --> 29:24.083
Why are you acting so noble?

29:29.541 --> 29:30.666
On the day of my award,

29:30.750 --> 29:33.708
I know you were
on a date with another girl.

29:35.875 --> 29:38.416
I took photos. Do you want to see them?

29:42.750 --> 29:43.875
That's right.

29:46.583 --> 29:49.083
I went on a blind date
set up by my dad that day.

29:56.791 --> 29:58.666
But I completely rejected her.

30:01.208 --> 30:02.416
You didn't do the same.

30:15.416 --> 30:17.958
PARKING LOT

30:25.750 --> 30:26.708
No address on the envelope.

30:26.791 --> 30:28.291
You think I wouldn't check
security footage?

30:28.375 --> 30:29.583
It's my life. How is it your business?

30:29.666 --> 30:32.333
-What are you trying to do?
-Hey!

30:32.416 --> 30:34.416
How is it your business?
Who the heck are you?

30:34.500 --> 30:36.250
What are you doing?

30:36.333 --> 30:37.583
You stay out of this!

30:40.250 --> 30:41.500
I'm sorry.

30:41.583 --> 30:43.500
I just wanted you
to break up with Yang Yu-hsien.

30:44.500 --> 30:45.875
Psycho.

30:49.333 --> 30:51.750
I really just want you
to break up with Yang Yu-hsien.

30:53.416 --> 30:55.125
I don't care what your intentions are.

30:55.208 --> 30:56.916
If you ever mess with me again,

30:57.833 --> 30:59.500
this won't be the last time you see me.

31:02.250 --> 31:04.125
-Hey, you--
-Pang.

31:07.041 --> 31:08.750
What's with her?

31:10.166 --> 31:11.833
Can you do me a favor?

31:13.750 --> 31:16.875
CHRONIC MYELOID LEUKEMIA

31:19.708 --> 31:21.041
I'm sorry.

31:21.625 --> 31:23.416
I should have told you.

31:26.666 --> 31:29.041
You said Sung Yuan-yuan
is your only family.

31:30.458 --> 31:32.958
Why haven't you told her you're sick?

31:34.500 --> 31:36.666
I don't want her to be devastated.

31:37.250 --> 31:38.500
If you die,

31:38.583 --> 31:40.583
she'll still be devastated.

31:45.750 --> 31:48.416
Just let her know after I die.

31:49.375 --> 31:50.375
I know it's strange,

31:50.458 --> 31:52.750
I just hope
that someone can be by her side

31:52.833 --> 31:54.458
as she goes through everything.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.125
I'm sorry.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.625
The girl I love is in love
with your fiancé.

32:11.416 --> 32:12.583
K.

32:13.666 --> 32:15.666
How much time do you have left?

32:17.291 --> 32:18.708
Less than a year.

32:23.083 --> 32:25.125
I know it's strange,

32:28.666 --> 32:30.208
-but I'm begging you--
-I can promise you

32:30.291 --> 32:32.083
I'll break up with Yang Yu-hsien,

32:33.166 --> 32:34.291
but there's one condition.

32:36.791 --> 32:38.333
What is it?

32:38.916 --> 32:41.750
I'm holding an exhibition
on death and desire.

32:42.375 --> 32:44.083
Aren't you dying?

32:44.166 --> 32:45.250
Be my subject.

32:46.291 --> 32:48.541
Hey, K is a person, not your work.

32:48.625 --> 32:50.750
I'm going to treat him as a piece of work.

32:50.833 --> 32:52.750
You crazy bitch,
what are you talking about?

32:52.833 --> 32:54.083
You can decide.

33:13.541 --> 33:15.583
That smells good.

33:17.291 --> 33:18.708
Wash your hands.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.500
You're upset?

33:27.375 --> 33:28.666
I'm not.

33:29.666 --> 33:30.791
What if

33:31.750 --> 33:33.333
we go on a trip?

33:35.083 --> 33:36.000
Where to?

33:36.083 --> 33:37.708
To the beach.

33:37.791 --> 33:39.625
When you were in college,

33:39.708 --> 33:41.083
you wanted to take me to the beach.

33:42.083 --> 33:44.125
But because of the accident,

33:44.208 --> 33:45.708
we went straight back to Taipei.

33:47.875 --> 33:48.916
Come on.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Let's go.

33:50.083 --> 33:51.041
Let's go to the beach.

33:53.291 --> 33:54.250
Sure.

33:54.333 --> 33:55.708
I'll take you there on my next day off.

33:59.708 --> 34:01.041
Give it back.

34:07.666 --> 34:08.625
Delicious.

34:11.375 --> 34:13.666
When did you first meet Sung Yuan-yuan?

34:15.500 --> 34:16.583
Senior year of high school.

34:18.916 --> 34:20.750
What was she like in high school?

34:25.833 --> 34:27.333
She had pretty eyes.

34:28.333 --> 34:29.958
If you could turn back time,

34:30.875 --> 34:32.958
would you still let yourself
fall in love with her?

34:36.208 --> 34:37.708
You still have time,

34:38.291 --> 34:40.458
why haven't you ever dated her?

34:44.083 --> 34:45.541
You've known each other for so long,

34:45.625 --> 34:46.750
have you had sex?

34:48.833 --> 34:50.166
You ask too many questions.

34:51.500 --> 34:54.791
Are you not telling her the truth
because you're afraid she'll leave you?

34:55.500 --> 34:56.958
Isn't that being selfish?

35:00.208 --> 35:01.916
What could she do if she knew?

35:05.000 --> 35:06.708
Do you understand the pain?

35:13.916 --> 35:15.041
Cream is just like me.

35:15.125 --> 35:17.916
We lost our family
when we were 18 years old.

35:18.916 --> 35:20.083
I'm her only family.

35:20.166 --> 35:21.541
What do you want me to say?

35:23.375 --> 35:25.166
Should I hurt her again?

35:27.583 --> 35:29.000
If she knew,

35:29.958 --> 35:31.958
would she be able to take it?

35:35.000 --> 35:36.750
There's nothing a person can't take.

35:37.666 --> 35:39.791
You just lack self-confidence.

35:41.583 --> 35:44.166
Sung Yuan-yuan is stronger than you think.

36:04.625 --> 36:07.750
I didn't know Taiwan
had such a beautiful place!

36:08.958 --> 36:10.583
I remember you said that

36:10.666 --> 36:13.375
the end of the sea is the other world.

36:14.083 --> 36:15.041
Yes.

36:15.541 --> 36:16.416
Look.

36:17.041 --> 36:19.291
The upside-down world.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.416
Dad!

36:25.500 --> 36:29.000
Mom! My sister! How are you guys?

36:29.708 --> 36:31.875
Can you see me?

36:33.458 --> 36:35.125
Do you miss me?

36:44.291 --> 36:45.333
K.

36:46.416 --> 36:48.875
Save your next life for me too, okay?

36:50.875 --> 36:52.291
Why in the next life?

36:53.375 --> 36:55.166
Because I like someone else in this life.

37:00.541 --> 37:02.041
Do you really like him?

37:04.708 --> 37:05.541
Yes.

37:52.208 --> 37:54.791
<i>Sung Yuan-yuan is stronger than you think.</i>

37:55.458 --> 37:56.333
<i>Perhaps.</i>

37:57.333 --> 37:59.291
But why would I risk it?

37:59.375 --> 38:00.708
Risk what?

38:04.541 --> 38:06.041
If Cream finds out,

38:06.125 --> 38:07.791
what can she change?

38:09.166 --> 38:10.583
What if she finds out

38:13.458 --> 38:15.291
and gives up on me even before I do?

38:23.125 --> 38:25.083
These are all
hypothetical questions you're asking.

38:26.708 --> 38:29.041
I'm surprised by your chauvinist ideas.

38:29.125 --> 38:31.791
You're just looking for an ATM for her.

38:31.875 --> 38:33.583
You can think of it like that.

38:34.208 --> 38:36.125
I'm a jerk. I'm selfish. So what?

38:37.750 --> 38:38.916
She's my only family.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.916
I want her to live a good life.
