WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:03.537
Previously on This Is Us...

00:03.571 --> 00:05.473
I came here for my brother.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.041
I was hoping
to take him back with me.

00:07.075 --> 00:09.543
You should've left me to rot!

00:09.577 --> 00:11.079
Join my campaign.

00:11.112 --> 00:13.081
You swear this is not
a pity job?

00:13.114 --> 00:16.050
I wouldn't dare
offer you a pity job.

00:16.084 --> 00:18.152
-Hey, I'm Randall.
-Uh, Jesse.

00:18.186 --> 00:19.820
RANDALL:
Nice to meet you, Jesse.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.089
Did William
ever mention a Jesse?

00:21.122 --> 00:23.091
Dad, Grandpa's gay.

00:23.124 --> 00:26.026
Or at least bi.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.762
There's no Jack here.
It's Pilgrim Rick.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.665
YOUNG RANDALL:
I want every Thanksgiving

00:31.699 --> 00:34.268
to be like this
for the rest of my life.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.280
:
Can I help you with anything?

00:46.314 --> 00:48.015
Maybe you could have asked me
that question

00:48.048 --> 00:49.950
before I started
cutting the onions.

00:49.983 --> 00:52.186
No, because then you'd
have me cutting the onions.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.387
Yeah.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.191
This is probably
our last Thanksgiving

00:57.225 --> 00:58.792
with the kids all living here.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.628
Yeah, well, with how much
they've been

01:00.661 --> 01:02.796
at each other's throats,
maybe that's a good thing.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.798
-Whoa, Bec.

01:04.832 --> 01:07.201
Are you opening up a pie shop
that I don't know about?

01:07.235 --> 01:09.303
I know,
I kind of overdid it, huh?

01:11.439 --> 01:14.242
Do you think we made a mistake
by not giving the kids

01:14.275 --> 01:17.245
some big,
extended family Thanksgiving?

01:17.278 --> 01:19.447
No, come on.
Our families are terrible.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.149
But Miguel's coming over.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.783
He's pretty much
extended family.

01:22.816 --> 01:25.219
I know, and I feel like
a traitor for having him over.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.620
Bec, you're not a traitor.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.156
His ex is my best friend,

01:28.189 --> 01:29.823
and he's coming
for Thanksgiving.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.759
That's best friend treason.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.995
Bec, it's the man's first
Thanksgiving since the divorce.

01:35.028 --> 01:37.898
And with Shelly taking the kids
to Connecticut for her family,

01:37.931 --> 01:39.500
he would be alone otherwise.

01:39.533 --> 01:42.503
Well, maybe he wouldn't be alone

01:42.536 --> 01:44.972
if he'd fought a little harder
to save his marriage.

01:45.005 --> 01:46.974
That is Shelly's side of things.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.842
I didn't know
we were taking sides.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.944
Well, do you want to take sides?

01:50.978 --> 01:52.313
I don't want to take sides.
I don't want to have a fight.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.614
I don't want
to take sides, either.

01:56.517 --> 01:57.918
What is that?

01:57.951 --> 02:00.087
Uh... sounds like laughter.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.089
-It couldn't be.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.125
Shall we ever.

02:08.162 --> 02:10.130
:
Don't make it complicated.

02:10.164 --> 02:12.433
-Randall's college essay.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.101
-It's not that funny.
-KATE: Okay, then go ahead.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.336
-Read them the question.
-No.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.338
-Read it.
-Come on.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.872
-JACK: Come on.
-So the question is,

02:18.906 --> 02:22.109
"So far, what person has
most impacted your life?"

02:22.142 --> 02:23.677
And he doesn't want to go

02:23.711 --> 02:25.613
with the firefighter
who found him on the steps.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.215
-RANDALL:
But the question is flawed.
-KATE: No, no, no.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.949
The question
is an underhanded softball

02:28.982 --> 02:30.518
-that you should clobber.
-Clobber, Randall.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.019
-No...
-It's so easy.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.821
The whole premise
of the question is wrong.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.556
No one person can
have the greatest impact

02:35.589 --> 02:37.625
-on your life.
-Oh, my-- Blah, blah, blah.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.393
Can someone please tell him
that he's overthinking this?

02:39.427 --> 02:41.061
Hey, your brother's gonna
make the right decision.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.396
What do you think?

02:42.430 --> 02:44.532
The fireman's a layup.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.400
-Oh! There you go.
-He said it himself.
-Oh...

02:46.434 --> 02:48.135
-Come on.
-Kev, ball.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.303
-Bah.
-Interception!
-REBECCA: Not inside...

02:51.439 --> 02:53.407
*

02:53.441 --> 02:55.676
-Whoa!
-I don't want to play.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.212
I'm not playing!

02:58.246 --> 03:00.080
-RANDALL: Touchdown!

03:00.113 --> 03:01.682
Doorbell. Doorbell.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.717
Hey, Kev, you want to get that?

03:03.751 --> 03:05.986
-KATE: Oh!
-RANDALL: Oh!

03:06.019 --> 03:08.322
How long does it take them
to go to the store

03:08.356 --> 03:10.858
and get cranberry sauce?
I called an hour ago, Shelly.

03:12.693 --> 03:16.564
Shelly, I just want to say
happy Thanksgiving to our kids.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.599
Shelly, don't hang up on...

03:18.632 --> 03:21.602
She hung up on me.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.371
Hey.

03:23.404 --> 03:26.374
Hey. Happy Thanksgiving.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.141
I brought a pie.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.246
-REBECCA: I'm gonna go put it
in the kitchen.
-Yeah, okay.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.884
*

03:41.755 --> 03:43.724
So, the person who's made
the biggest impact on your life?

03:43.757 --> 03:45.459
-Yeah.
-Ooh, that fireman
who found you.

03:45.493 --> 03:46.894
-No. No. I'm not...
-Colleges love
that kind of stuff.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.562
-I'm not doing that...
-Hello.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.564
Uh, can somebody grab
the Pilgrim Rick hat, please?

03:50.598 --> 03:52.232
Wow. You guys
still do that stuff?

03:52.266 --> 03:53.634
Sure do, pal. Family tradition.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.536
-That we've outgrown.
-Oh, come on.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.771
Aw, I still like when Dad
does Pilgrim Rick.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.072
Thank you, Katie girl.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.107
Yeah, and it covers
all the grays.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.542
-ALL: Oh!
-Whoa!

04:01.575 --> 04:03.444
Ooh, do you need some ice
for that burn?

04:03.477 --> 04:05.546
-She got you.
-I thought this was
a Thanksgiving dinner.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.780
I didn't realize it was a roast.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.382
KATE:
Hey, a little bit of both.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.483
-JACK: Yeah, okay, sure.
-Here, you might need the...

04:10.851 --> 04:12.920
JACK:
You knock it off with that...

04:12.953 --> 04:15.088
Excuse me a second.

04:15.122 --> 04:16.657
RANDALL:
Don't take sides.

04:24.131 --> 04:26.634
Hey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

04:29.169 --> 04:32.973
You know, I get the stress
of who gets the house,

04:33.006 --> 04:35.809
and the alimony
and all that crap,

04:35.843 --> 04:38.912
but turning the kids against me?

04:38.946 --> 04:41.449
Your kids can't be turned
against you, Miguel.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.850
Okay? They love you.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.152
Come on, Jack.
Just say it like it is.

04:45.185 --> 04:47.187
We both know that I wasn't there

04:47.220 --> 04:49.423
for Andy and Amber
like I should've been.

04:49.457 --> 04:52.826
Work always came first,
and now I'm paying the price.

04:55.663 --> 04:58.466
Okay, fine.

04:58.499 --> 05:02.436
You could have... you could've
been a more present father.

05:02.470 --> 05:06.640
You know? But you wanted
to provide for your family.

05:06.674 --> 05:10.010
I've never seen anyone work
as hard as you.

05:10.043 --> 05:13.881
You know, I remember, I remember
when you made upper management.

05:13.914 --> 05:17.551
I remember how proud of you
I was.

05:17.585 --> 05:21.489
You were gonna be doing
the big deals with the big boys.

05:21.522 --> 05:24.625
And then you figured out
that the big deals

05:24.658 --> 05:26.627
were done on a golf course.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.629
And so what did you do?

05:28.662 --> 05:31.732
You bought some clubs,
you got lessons.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.301
You would go to the range
after work and hit balls...

05:34.334 --> 05:36.404
Instead of going home
and having a family dinner.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.472
...until a Puerto Rican kid

05:38.506 --> 05:40.708
who'd never been
to business school,

05:40.741 --> 05:44.378
who-who'd never set foot
on a golf course,

05:44.412 --> 05:49.316
let alone played on one, joins
his boss's Saturday foursome,

05:49.349 --> 05:53.153
and he becomes country club
champion four years in a row.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.556
You got to take that fight,

05:55.589 --> 06:00.894
and you need to show your kids
that you are still their father.

06:00.928 --> 06:03.831
You hear me?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.833
Yeah.

06:05.866 --> 06:10.538
You don't want to be 65 years
old and not know your grandkids.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.382
Man, what's a guy got to do
to get some turkey around here?

06:29.790 --> 06:31.525
Hey, have you heard
from Jae

06:31.559 --> 06:34.094
-About moving today's
soup kitchen visit

06:34.127 --> 06:35.463
from the church
to the rec center.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.764
:
Not yet. What about it?

06:36.797 --> 06:37.865
Can you rinse and repeat, baby?

06:37.898 --> 06:38.866
I'm sorry.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.906
-Ah...

06:45.939 --> 06:48.476
-I have not heard from Jae-won.
-Okay.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.478
I hope he's on board with me
changing the venue.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.813
I'm not sure he likes me
working on the campaign.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.815
What? That's crazy.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.450
You've had, like,
300 stupendous ideas

06:56.484 --> 06:57.651
since joining my campaign.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.419
The fish-fry fundraiser,

06:59.453 --> 07:01.321
pushing for the town hall debate
next week.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.323
Plus, you look smoking
even when you're dressing down

07:03.356 --> 07:04.958
for a soup kitchen.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.426
Okay. You're right.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.795
I'm crushing being
your field director.

07:07.828 --> 07:08.996
You are.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.398
-Mm.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.467
-Mm-mm.

07:13.501 --> 07:14.502
-Hustle now.

07:14.535 --> 07:15.603
-Yes.
I'll meet you downstairs.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.571
Toby and Kate will be here
any minute.

07:17.605 --> 07:20.474
You sure they're up to cooking
while we're out?

07:20.508 --> 07:22.275
I mean, Kate's all IVF'd up,

07:22.309 --> 07:23.744
and Toby's just getting back
on his feet.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.112
I quadruple-checked.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.446
They are excited
to be in charge this year.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.548
TESS:
Mom?

07:29.316 --> 07:31.184
Yeah?

07:42.863 --> 07:45.533
-TESS: I don't feel good.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.801
Hmm.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.604
No fever. Go lie down, okay?

07:50.638 --> 07:53.507
-I'll tell Aunt Kate
to keep an eye on you.
-Okay.

07:53.541 --> 07:56.376
*

07:58.746 --> 08:00.881
Happy Thanksgiving.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.282
-Happy Thanksgiving.
-Happy Thanksgiving.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.951
The cavalry is here!

08:03.984 --> 08:06.987
All right. What do we got here?

08:07.020 --> 08:09.322
-Hey-oh.
-Hi.

08:09.356 --> 08:12.325
How's my sis feeling with her
little turducken in the oven?

08:12.359 --> 08:13.627
-Pretty good.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.362
Yeah. The morning sickness
isn't too bad,

08:15.395 --> 08:17.665
and Toby's been coming through
with the back rubs.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.567
Yeah. My fingers are basically
tension assassins.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.735
-Give me some of that. Uh.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.370
Tess isn't feeling well.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.372
Is it okay with you guys
if she stays here with you?

08:25.405 --> 08:26.840
Yeah, that'd be
good practice for us

08:26.874 --> 08:28.876
for when we have
a little sicko of our own.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.178
-If this is too much
for you, Tobe, you just...

08:31.211 --> 08:32.546
Because we can make another
arrangement, right?

08:32.580 --> 08:34.481
Look, guys, guys, guys, guys.
Hey, this-- it's great.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.216
We'll watch Tess.
This is gonna be fine.

08:36.249 --> 08:39.152
Look, my comeback is about
small victories, all right?

08:39.186 --> 08:42.189
And helping Kate cook
a 15-pound Butterball

08:42.222 --> 08:43.924
using Snoop and Martha's recipe

08:43.957 --> 08:46.259
will be a small
but meaningful victory.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.061
RANDALL:
All right, then.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.831
Hey, girls, let's hit the road!

08:50.864 --> 08:52.265
BETH:
So, if anything happens,

08:52.299 --> 08:54.034
just give us a call.
We'll be back by 4:00.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.703
-Yep.
-Okay.
All right. Let's hit it.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.838
Hey, Annie, why is there
a gigantic teddy bear

08:57.871 --> 08:59.106
sitting at
the dining room table?

08:59.139 --> 09:00.574
It's a secret.

09:00.608 --> 09:03.010
A secret?
It's creepy is what it is.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.845
-All right, have fun...
-Have fun.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.847
...at the homeless shelter.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.782
*

09:13.120 --> 09:15.255
Be right with you, folks.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.694
Hello, little ladies.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.796
Don't you guys look beautiful?
Uh, you want to go

09:22.830 --> 09:24.965
help them over there? Yeah.

09:24.998 --> 09:28.201
Explain to me how this
is better than Linwood Baptist.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.038
Well, we just felt like,
uh, the athletic center

09:31.071 --> 09:33.406
represents a broader sample
of the 12th.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.243
Did we? Because, you know,
at this very moment,

09:36.276 --> 09:38.746
Sol Brown is handing out turkeys
over at Linwood Baptist,

09:38.779 --> 09:40.781
the biggest Thanksgiving
soup kitchen in the city,

09:40.814 --> 09:43.383
which gets photographed
every year by The Inquirer,

09:43.416 --> 09:44.718
The Telegraph,
The Philadelphia Tribune...

09:44.752 --> 09:46.419
Please stop
saying newspapers at me.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.555
We-we don't need a photo op,
you know?

09:48.588 --> 09:50.423
Randall wants to connect
with the people.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.159
He doesn't want to look
like the guy who drove in

09:52.192 --> 09:53.927
to hold a ladle
and get his picture taken.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.428
-We just want...
-I need to go to the bathroom.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.798
Oh...

09:57.831 --> 10:00.400
To not be continued.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.236
-Excuse me.
-Mm-hmm.

10:03.270 --> 10:06.173
Have we landed on a job title
for your wife?

10:06.206 --> 10:09.009
Yeah, field director. She'll
spread my message, coordinate...

10:09.042 --> 10:12.445
I'm aware what a field director
does, since I usually hire them.

10:12.479 --> 10:15.683
Randall, has your wife
ever worked on a campaign?

10:15.716 --> 10:17.284
Because I think
she needs to understand

10:17.317 --> 10:18.952
-that there's a system here.
-Hey, Jae-won.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.754
You've done an amazing job.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.422
All right?
You joining my campaign

10:22.455 --> 10:24.424
has been divine intervention.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.627
But Beth is my wife,
and she's for real

10:27.661 --> 10:30.163
and it's not open
for discussion.

10:30.197 --> 10:33.033
("Just a Friend"
by Biz Markie playing)

10:33.066 --> 10:35.002
Well, this is fun.

10:36.904 --> 10:39.673
* Oh, baby, you

10:39.707 --> 10:42.710
* You got what I need

10:42.743 --> 10:45.045
* You got everything I need

10:45.078 --> 10:47.180
* You're like medicine to me

10:47.214 --> 10:48.548
* Oh, baby...

10:48.581 --> 10:51.184
Here you go.
Happy Thanksgiving to you.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.020
They're raising my rent again.

10:53.053 --> 10:56.656
-They want me to move out.
-Of course they do.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.059
Landlords want higher income
earners to move in.

10:59.092 --> 11:02.229
* So glad you saved me, dear

11:02.262 --> 11:04.197
* Saved me, dear... *

11:04.231 --> 11:06.166
Happy Thanksgiving to you,
young man. Okay.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.301
* Things were wrong,
you made them right *

11:08.335 --> 11:11.404
* How did you do it, dear?

11:11.438 --> 11:13.540
* Do it, dear *

11:13.573 --> 11:16.910
* Oh, I'm thankful every day

11:16.944 --> 11:19.412
* Oh, that you came my way

11:19.446 --> 11:21.882
* And I hope and pray

11:21.915 --> 11:24.317
* That you never ever go away

11:24.351 --> 11:28.055
* 'Cause you, oh,
you got what I need *

11:28.088 --> 11:29.522
* Little girl...

11:29.556 --> 11:32.225
Don't be shy.
This is a growing girl.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.161
* You're like medincine to me

11:34.194 --> 11:35.662
* Oh, baby...

11:35.695 --> 11:37.230
ANNIE:
Deja, you're giving too many.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.399
The man said
only one cookie a person.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.869
Well, the man doesn't get it.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.771
-BETH: Man..

11:43.804 --> 11:46.339
None of my messages
are getting through to Kate.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.275
Mm. This reception sucks.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.110
We should put that
on our platform:

11:50.143 --> 11:51.711
fix cell phone service
in Philly.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.914
Happy Thanksgiving.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.416
* Don't ever stop them, dear

11:56.449 --> 11:59.086
* Stop them dear... *

11:59.119 --> 12:01.121
No, no. Wait, wait, hold up.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.890
Great news.
I convinced a photographer

12:02.923 --> 12:04.691
from Linwood Baptist to come
here and take some pictures.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.059
Best of both worlds, baby.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.260
-Oh, dude, that's great.
-Yeah.

12:07.294 --> 12:11.531
That's

12:11.564 --> 12:14.034
I'm sorry, guys. I just...
I don't think it's a good idea.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.104
People came here to have
a nice meal with their families,

12:17.137 --> 12:19.139
and most of them don't want
to be photographed

12:19.172 --> 12:21.608
getting a handout. You know,
Randall's whole strategy...

12:21.641 --> 12:23.143
You know, his strategy
is to get more votes

12:23.176 --> 12:24.277
than he currently has, Beth.

12:28.648 --> 12:32.786
Guys, stop.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.354
All right, I'm sorry, Jae-won.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.096
-I-I called in a favor, man.
-I know,

12:43.130 --> 12:45.665
and I'm sorry, but you should've
run it by us first.

12:45.698 --> 12:48.268
No, actually, no, because
I'm the campaign manager

12:48.301 --> 12:50.103
-and what I'm supposed to do
is get-- No, no.
-Jae-won, please.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.571
Randall, you're
making a mistake.

12:51.604 --> 12:52.806
What do you want me to do, man?

12:52.840 --> 12:54.641
I don't care if it's a mistake,

12:54.674 --> 12:56.810
she's my wife.

13:01.114 --> 13:05.618
-Yeah, um, happy Thanksgiving.
-To you and yours

13:05.652 --> 13:08.588
as well, man. Hey...

13:08.621 --> 13:10.457
Oh, man.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.392
Yeah...

13:17.664 --> 13:20.600
Ooh, a terrier!
Dad, could we go play with it?

13:20.633 --> 13:24.004
-Yeah, let's go say hi.
-Oh, yay!

13:24.037 --> 13:25.205
Hey, Randall.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.207
Yeah.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.376
I'm just curious.

13:29.409 --> 13:32.545
Of my 300 ideas
over the past few weeks,

13:32.579 --> 13:34.982
how many of them
did you really think were--

13:35.015 --> 13:36.383
What's the word you used?

13:36.416 --> 13:39.719
-Stupendous.
-Or...

13:39.752 --> 13:42.389
how many times were you just
trying to make me feel good

13:42.422 --> 13:44.191
because you thought
your recently-fired wife

13:44.224 --> 13:45.392
needed a win?

13:45.425 --> 13:48.228
Beth...

13:48.261 --> 13:52.866
Oh, man. That's what I thought.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.968
Actually, it's not
what I thought,

13:55.002 --> 13:58.872
-you know, which really sucks.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.142
-Hey.
-Oh, God.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.477
-Oh, man. We got to get home.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.180
-Come on, girls. Let's go.
-Come on.

14:07.214 --> 14:11.084
-Yeah.

14:15.588 --> 14:19.359
*

14:40.247 --> 14:41.581
How we feeling?

14:43.716 --> 14:46.186
We felt better shoveling crap
back at my base.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.854
Yeah, I'll bet.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.790
Got about a week more to get
that junk out of your system.

14:50.823 --> 14:53.994
Roger that, Sarge. Glad to hear
you got a new mission.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.400
VIETNAMESE MAN:
G.I.!

15:05.305 --> 15:07.474
The boy cut his foot
on the wire last week.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.110
Then the wire is doing its job.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.418
Supply chopper's
bringing a hot turkey.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.087
Me and some of the guys
are gonna have

15:20.120 --> 15:21.588
a sit-down Thanksgiving dinner.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.423
You're welcome to join us.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.993
That is, if you can leave
your sunny-ass disposition here.

15:28.095 --> 15:32.132
* In the chilly
hours and minutes *

15:32.165 --> 15:34.467
* Of uncertainty

15:34.501 --> 15:37.170
* I want to be in the warm...

15:37.204 --> 15:40.340
My dad's smoked turkey,
the best.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.775
-You'd smoke anything, Murph.

15:44.777 --> 15:48.748
* To feel you all around me...

15:48.781 --> 15:51.318
-Robinson.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.686
Figured he'd, uh,

15:53.720 --> 15:56.789
he'd want to know about
all the fun that he's missing.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.825
Hey, uh, what's the deal
with your brother, Sarge?

15:58.858 --> 16:00.960
Hmm?

16:00.994 --> 16:02.162
* When sundown

16:02.195 --> 16:04.531
* Pales the sky...

16:04.564 --> 16:08.435
He's fine. Just misses home.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.603
He ain't fine. He's a medic.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.540
He shovels guts
back into body cavities.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.608
Meanwhile, you all treat us
like the field goal kicker

16:15.642 --> 16:17.977
till you take a bullet
and want morphine.

16:18.011 --> 16:21.548
Then we're your best friend.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.451
* Would be the sweetest thing

16:24.484 --> 16:26.519
* T'would make me sing

16:26.553 --> 16:30.357
* Ah, but I may as well
try and catch *

16:30.390 --> 16:34.394
* The wind

16:34.427 --> 16:35.828
* Diddy di dee

16:35.862 --> 16:37.530
* Dee diddy diddy...

16:37.564 --> 16:41.801
Miss, can I...?

16:41.834 --> 16:43.236
Heavy.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.377
* When rain has hung
the leave with tears *

16:50.410 --> 16:54.047
* I want you near to kill

16:54.081 --> 16:55.982
* My fears

16:56.015 --> 16:59.352
* To help me to leave
all my blues *

16:59.386 --> 17:01.854
* Behind

17:01.888 --> 17:04.324
* For...

17:29.749 --> 17:32.752
Hey.

17:32.785 --> 17:35.588
You haven't been
catching any fish.

17:35.622 --> 17:40.093
No, no fish. I-I brought food.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.795
Food. Thuc...

17:45.064 --> 17:48.101
Food. Food.

17:50.570 --> 17:54.774
Your boy, is he
He's okay?

17:57.244 --> 17:59.379
Can I see him?

18:00.613 --> 18:01.581
Can I see him?

18:20.467 --> 18:22.335
-Okay.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.940
BOY:
Ahh!

18:45.358 --> 18:48.328
-Nicky, wake up. Come on.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.796
Hustle up, let's go.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.731
Come on.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.673
He's burning up.
His foot's infected.

19:00.707 --> 19:03.510
I'm not gonna save a kid's life

19:03.543 --> 19:05.945
just so he can grow up one day
and zap Americans.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.014
Clean and dress the wound.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.549
No.

19:09.582 --> 19:13.820
Clean and bandage the wound.
That is an order.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.864
He's gonna be okay.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.300
He's gonna be okay,
but this is gonna hurt, okay?

19:27.334 --> 19:28.435
It's gonna sting, ouch.

19:31.571 --> 19:34.474
-It's okay, it's okay.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.911
TOWNIE:
Okay in there, Sarge?

19:38.945 --> 19:41.781
Yeah! We're doing good.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.933
Ah.

20:24.291 --> 20:26.225
He's just a kid, Nicky.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.698
You need to wake the hell up.

20:31.731 --> 20:35.402
This ville is nothing but women

20:35.435 --> 20:38.738
and kids and old men.

20:45.177 --> 20:48.981
My first CO here was a guy

20:49.015 --> 20:51.351
named Captain Greg Minetto.

20:53.853 --> 20:57.424
"Bones," we called him.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.892
We were pulling security
outside Da Nang,

20:59.926 --> 21:03.062
and I'm brand new in-country,

21:03.095 --> 21:07.600
virgin, scared to death.

21:07.634 --> 21:10.002
Sometimes the guys
got on my ass.

21:13.105 --> 21:17.644
I mean, I couldn't stick on
a damn Band-Aid without shaking.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.513
But one time,

21:20.547 --> 21:23.416
Bones got fed up with them
always ragging on me, so...

21:23.450 --> 21:27.954
he grabs a big chicken
from the ville,

21:27.987 --> 21:30.957
and bam,

21:30.990 --> 21:32.992
chops off its head
with his Ka-Bar.

21:35.528 --> 21:38.698
And the chicken's flapping
around without a head,

21:38.731 --> 21:41.033
blood gushing,

21:41.067 --> 21:43.870
and Bones takes the chicken
and he tosses it to me.

21:43.903 --> 21:48.708
There I am, with a bloody,
flapping chicken,

21:48.741 --> 21:53.380
and Bones says to the guys,
"Pretend that chicken's you.

21:53.413 --> 21:57.617
"Pretend you're the one
flapping around,

21:57.650 --> 22:01.688
"screaming for a medic,
bullets still flying.

22:01.721 --> 22:03.890
"You best hope Nicky
doesn't mind

22:03.923 --> 22:07.894
trying to save your sorry ass,
because Nicky's all you got."

22:13.400 --> 22:18.771
And after that, the guys
showed me a little respect.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.175
I mean, how could you
not love Bones?

22:23.209 --> 22:24.911
And the villagers
loved him, too, you know?

22:24.944 --> 22:28.180
The old ladies, they did
his laundry, brought him food.

22:28.214 --> 22:32.018
There was this one.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.854
No teeth, but always smiling.

22:34.887 --> 22:38.057
She cut his hair
and talked to him

22:38.090 --> 22:40.893
and he would nod
like he understood.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.766
One night,
the VC got through the wire,

22:46.799 --> 22:48.768
tossed a satchel charge
into his bunker

22:48.801 --> 22:53.139
and turned Cap into a big sloppy
bowl of chicken fricassee.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.544
They targeted Bones
and no one else.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.083
The old lady with no teeth
told her VC brother

23:04.116 --> 23:06.052
where he could find him.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.903
You can be nice to them
all you want, Jack.

23:26.839 --> 23:29.976
But they're not just women
and children.

24:12.051 --> 24:13.452
You here all week?

24:13.486 --> 24:16.789
That's the plan. You?

24:16.823 --> 24:20.126
Um, hard to say.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.831
-William.
-Jesse.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.435
-Please, don't, uh...
-Ah.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.003
-...let me stop you...

24:53.593 --> 24:55.695
Jesse?

24:55.728 --> 24:57.697
Technically,
cocaine is my problem,

24:57.730 --> 25:01.167
not, uh, sparkling rosé, so...

25:03.502 --> 25:05.872
-Come on.

25:05.905 --> 25:09.809
You need something besides
cheap wine in your stomach.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.744
Come on.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.582
All right.

25:15.615 --> 25:18.217
I was a bond trader in London.

25:18.250 --> 25:21.087
The job was all-consuming
and put strains

25:21.120 --> 25:24.056
on an already complicated

25:24.090 --> 25:27.594
and mismatched marriage.

25:27.627 --> 25:30.029
Cocaine helped me keep pace
with the workload

25:30.062 --> 25:32.899
until the workload couldn't
keep pace with my addiction.

25:32.932 --> 25:35.067
I lost everything.

25:35.101 --> 25:37.069
Moved to the States.

25:37.103 --> 25:40.773
I lived with my sister
for a while in Chicago,

25:40.807 --> 25:44.010
and then I came to Philly,
where I worked

25:44.043 --> 25:46.012
front of house in a restaurant
because my accent

25:46.045 --> 25:48.047
-classed the place up.
-Accent classed the place up.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.882
Yeah, I was at that meeting.

25:54.253 --> 25:57.389
Let's hear the true story.

26:04.631 --> 26:06.699
Okay, fine.

26:06.733 --> 26:10.870
You're... an inexplicably
pleasant man

26:10.903 --> 26:12.805
worthy of the truth.

26:15.808 --> 26:19.779
I started using cocaine
in the late '70s.

26:19.812 --> 26:22.114
I-I liked cocaine.

26:22.148 --> 26:24.550
:
I... That's not true.

26:24.583 --> 26:29.956
I liked Manchester United.
I love cocaine.

26:29.989 --> 26:32.659
Half my paycheck
went to the stuff,

26:32.692 --> 26:37.163
until I learned that...

26:37.196 --> 26:40.532
smoking crack cocaine
was cheaper.

26:42.301 --> 26:47.139
Also, I was never a bond trader.

26:49.508 --> 26:52.478
But one thing I said is true:

26:52.511 --> 26:55.982
my marriage to Anissa was...

26:56.015 --> 26:58.417
a complicated mismatch,

26:58.450 --> 27:01.854
and I do have
a sister in Chicago.

27:07.059 --> 27:12.264
I... I don't know why
Thanksgiving depresses me.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.866
It's not my holiday.

27:13.900 --> 27:18.137
In fact,
isn't it to celebrate you

27:18.170 --> 27:21.440
for defeating us
in your independence?

27:21.473 --> 27:24.977
:
No. It was not.

27:25.011 --> 27:30.649
Anyway, I was invited
to my sister's house,

27:30.683 --> 27:34.887
but the people there
will ask me how I'm doing,

27:34.921 --> 27:40.059
and... I'm in no mood
to spin lies

27:40.092 --> 27:41.994
about the joys of being sober.

27:42.028 --> 27:45.564
You stay sober,
you won't have to lie about it.

27:48.234 --> 27:51.037
Look, tonight a bunch of us
sober musicians

27:51.070 --> 27:53.339
are getting together.
On the holidays we like to play,

27:53.372 --> 27:56.809
uh, mostly to keep us from
getting into trouble.

27:56.843 --> 27:58.210
You're welcome to come.

27:58.244 --> 28:00.212
Good Lord.

28:00.246 --> 28:03.649
Listening to jazz sober
sounds awful.

28:06.452 --> 28:08.855
Just yourself.
We need the audience.

28:52.799 --> 28:54.366
So what needs to start first?

28:54.400 --> 28:56.235
The cranberry sauce.
You are in charge.

28:56.268 --> 28:59.105
-This is not a can.
-Right.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.373
I'm making cranberry sauce
from scratch?

29:01.407 --> 29:02.875
Isn't that kind of
a high

29:02.909 --> 29:04.076
Well, Randall has
a recipe binder.

29:04.110 --> 29:05.211
Recipe binder, okay.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.079
Randall's recipes.

29:07.113 --> 29:09.782
Okay. Of course, color-coded,

29:09.816 --> 29:12.484
uh, with an entire section
for confit.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.887
And he's marked our page for us.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.755
"Cranberry sauce with mint."

29:16.789 --> 29:20.793
Randall's recipe for cranberry
sauce has, like, 30 ingredients,

29:20.827 --> 29:23.796
including
"fresh mint from my garden."

29:23.830 --> 29:25.731
-Yeah.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.433
Okay.

29:27.466 --> 29:29.268
Okay, come here.
What is happening? Come here.

29:29.301 --> 29:31.303
Oh, okay, look. Randall is
the perfect embodiment

29:31.337 --> 29:34.140
of the perfect man.
He's basically your dad,

29:34.173 --> 29:36.308
-and I'm...
-Toby.

29:36.342 --> 29:39.979
Hey, me and you?

29:40.012 --> 29:42.849
We got this.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.650
-We can...

29:44.683 --> 29:46.185
We're gonna be great hosts.

29:46.218 --> 29:47.820
Okay? And we're gonna
be great parents.

29:47.854 --> 29:49.488
And today, we're gonna prove it.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.190
-Yeah. You're right.
So let's do us.

29:51.223 --> 29:52.791
-Okay. Do us.
-Me and you.

29:52.825 --> 29:54.193
All right, KaToby on three?

29:54.226 --> 29:56.795
One, two, KaToby.

29:56.829 --> 29:59.999
Tess, I got something for you.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.004
Oh. Oh.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.647
Hey. Uh, Tess needs your help.

30:15.681 --> 30:17.884
Why

30:17.917 --> 30:21.687
Yeah, fine. She just has--
she has two boxes of... things

30:21.720 --> 30:27.326
that, uh, a-a young woman might
need every full moon-ish.

30:29.361 --> 30:31.497
-Oh. Ugh.
-Yeah.

30:31.530 --> 30:34.466
I think this might be
her first period.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.835
Yeah, yeah. She looked confused.

30:45.377 --> 30:47.980
Hey.

30:48.014 --> 30:50.816
Is everything okay?

30:50.849 --> 30:53.920
TESS:
I'm fine, just leave me alone.

30:53.953 --> 30:58.690
I will, I just...

30:58.724 --> 31:00.092
Is this your first one?

31:00.126 --> 31:01.994
TESS:
Yes.

31:02.028 --> 31:04.363
Did you call your mom?

31:04.396 --> 31:06.165
TESS:
They didn't answer.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.167
I tried calling them, like,
five times.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.069
I texted them, though.

31:10.102 --> 31:12.404
I'm sure she'll call soon.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.875
Is there anything
I can help with?

31:24.450 --> 31:26.385
-Yeah.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.523
Do you want to come down
and help us?

31:31.557 --> 31:33.525
I'm never leaving this room.

31:33.559 --> 31:34.961
I'm too embarrassed to see Toby.

31:34.994 --> 31:36.562
-Oh...

31:36.595 --> 31:40.366
Hey. Tess, you have nothing
to be embarrassed about.

31:40.399 --> 31:43.202
And this is coming
from a woman who had

31:43.235 --> 31:47.206
the most embarrassing
first period ever.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.108
So, when I was around your age,

31:49.141 --> 31:52.278
we were staying at a beach house
with Miguel's family

31:52.311 --> 31:53.612
and I was sharing a room
with Amber,

31:53.645 --> 31:55.647
Miguel's daughter,
who I worshiped.

31:55.681 --> 31:57.649
I mean, she taught me
how to put on mascara.

31:57.683 --> 31:59.952
So, I was asleep
when it happened.

31:59.986 --> 32:01.920
So I stripped the bed, and then
I'm tip-toeing down the hall,

32:01.954 --> 32:04.223
and who do I run into?
Her older brother Andy.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.824
Who was a lifeguard.

32:05.857 --> 32:08.827
And of course, here I am
with this wadded-up bedding,

32:08.860 --> 32:12.898
and he just says, "Oh, what,
did you wet the bed, Pearson?"

32:12.931 --> 32:15.134
N-Now, if I say yes, everybody
at school is gonna think

32:15.167 --> 32:17.469
that I'm a bed-wetter
at the age of 12.

32:17.503 --> 32:19.638
So what do I say?
I say, "No, actually,

32:19.671 --> 32:23.442
"I just had my period and I need
a tampon. Do you have one?"

32:23.475 --> 32:25.311
:
He didn't know what to say.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.479
So, he's like stammering
and he tries to laugh if off,

32:27.513 --> 32:30.983
but then he just, like,
pushes past me.

32:31.017 --> 32:33.819
So, uh, needless to say, we've
never talked about it since.

32:33.852 --> 32:35.754
Anyway, I got you beat.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.857
-Yeah.

32:41.360 --> 32:45.197
Anyhow, I know you have a mom,
but if there's anything

32:45.231 --> 32:47.499
you ever want to talk to me
about, anytime...

32:47.533 --> 32:50.436
I mean, pretty soon,
you're gonna have...

32:50.469 --> 32:51.603
:
your first kiss.

32:51.637 --> 32:55.374
:
And your first boyfriend.

32:55.407 --> 32:58.344
Or girlfriend.

33:01.180 --> 33:04.150
Or girlfriend.

33:04.183 --> 33:07.019
Yeah, or girlfriend.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.361
MAN :
St. George came upon the ruins

33:15.394 --> 33:18.230
of the Rollins house and slept
on the cold sooted stones

33:18.264 --> 33:20.232
of the fireplace hearth.

33:20.266 --> 33:22.734
He awoke the next morning
with...

33:22.768 --> 33:25.204
Uh, I'm sorry, I...

33:25.237 --> 33:28.640
The last I heard, St. George
was lost in the brambles.

33:30.876 --> 33:33.412
Yes, 'cause you're
not listening.

33:33.445 --> 33:36.048
I think your mind is already
at your daughter's house.

33:36.082 --> 33:37.383
-No.
-Yeah.

33:37.416 --> 33:39.551
-No, no, it's not.
-Yes, it is.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.487
I thought that
you were excited

33:41.520 --> 33:43.322
that Amber had moved
to Scarsdale.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.691
I mean, we've only seen
our grandson, what,

33:45.724 --> 33:47.693
twice since they adopted him?

33:49.961 --> 33:52.231
I am excited.

33:52.264 --> 33:57.569
Well, in 6.5 miles,
you better act like it.

33:57.603 --> 33:59.771
It's just...

33:59.805 --> 34:01.740
I feel like a pity invite.

34:01.773 --> 34:03.209
-Yeah.

34:03.242 --> 34:05.611
I mean, the only reason
that we were asked to come over

34:05.644 --> 34:07.379
is because Shelly
is gonna be spending it

34:07.413 --> 34:10.916
with her husband's family.

34:10.949 --> 34:14.019
I'm sorry that you're missing
Thanksgiving for this.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.421
We're still gonna make it
back to Randall's

34:15.454 --> 34:16.788
in time for dessert.

34:16.822 --> 34:19.758
And besides,
I'm very much looking forward

34:19.791 --> 34:22.361
to spending some time
with your kids.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.130
It's gonna be a good day.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.703
Luke, you're supposed
to eat turkey

34:31.737 --> 34:35.707
-for Thanksgiving, not Cheerios.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.277
-Oh, honey.

34:38.310 --> 34:40.045
Don't be scared;
That's your grandpa.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.148
Nah, it's okay;
I have the same reaction

34:42.181 --> 34:43.582
every morning when
I look in the mirror.

34:48.254 --> 34:52.624
Oh, I, uh, read that Beckwith
and Hightower are merging.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.393
Is that a good thing
for you, Amber?

34:54.426 --> 34:56.595
I haven't been with Hightower
for over a year, Dad.

34:56.628 --> 34:58.564
ANDY:
Geez, Dad.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.932
Somebody hasn't been reading
Amber's Christmas newsletter.

35:00.966 --> 35:04.303
No, I do. I mean, we do.

35:04.336 --> 35:05.604
It's very entertaining,
by the way.

35:05.637 --> 35:08.340
Thanks, Rebecca.

35:10.309 --> 35:13.279
We haven't,
uh, seen Kevin's new movie, yet.

35:13.312 --> 35:15.581
Hmm.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.350
It's actually...
it's quite good.

35:18.384 --> 35:19.618
I've heard mixed.

35:21.187 --> 35:23.922
Yeah? I think it's, um,

35:23.955 --> 35:27.659
at a 94% on Rotten Tomatoes;
it's a site

35:27.693 --> 35:31.430
-that Kevin taught me about.
-Come on, you're killing me!

35:31.463 --> 35:33.965
Cowboys scored, Connor.

35:33.999 --> 35:35.667
Sorry, we have Washington
and the points.

35:35.701 --> 35:38.337
No, it's okay.

35:38.370 --> 35:41.473
Uh, we're a big football family,
actually, so I understand.

35:41.507 --> 35:43.108
Hmm.

35:46.412 --> 35:48.314
This vegan stuffing
is delicious, Amber.

35:48.347 --> 35:50.148
Well, thanks, Dad.

35:50.182 --> 35:53.652
What about you, Luke, do you
like your mother's stuffing?

35:53.685 --> 35:54.953
Do you like the vegan stuffing?

35:56.988 --> 35:58.790
Do any of these side dishes
have nuts in them?

35:58.824 --> 36:00.058
I get a little allergic.

36:00.091 --> 36:03.962
Uh, yes, actually,
the sweet potato casserole

36:03.995 --> 36:05.631
-has some slivered almonds.
-Ah...

36:05.664 --> 36:07.633
-I-I didn't know, I'm so sorry.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.167
-I didn't, I didn't know.
-First you steal my father

36:09.201 --> 36:10.569
from my mother,
and now you're trying to kill

36:10.602 --> 36:12.204
-my brother-in-law.

36:14.240 --> 36:17.509
Sorry, too soon?

36:17.543 --> 36:22.448
No, no. Not too soon, actually.

36:27.052 --> 36:30.356
You know, after
your mother and I split,

36:30.389 --> 36:33.325
I promised my best friend
and myself that I would fight

36:33.359 --> 36:36.528
to keep you kids in my life.

36:36.562 --> 36:39.498
And for a long time, I tried.

36:40.932 --> 36:43.235
I called every day,
I sent Christmas gifts.

36:43.269 --> 36:45.036
I tried to plan things.

36:47.239 --> 36:50.809
And I was lucky if I got
an e-mail back from you.

36:52.143 --> 36:53.445
So after a while...

36:54.980 --> 36:56.114
Well, I gave up.

37:00.252 --> 37:02.721
Well, you have
the Pearsons now, at least.

37:06.992 --> 37:09.895
Yes. Yes, I do.

37:11.830 --> 37:16.067
In heartbreak,
ten years after her husband

37:16.101 --> 37:19.405
and my best friend died,
and your mother had remarried...

37:21.473 --> 37:23.141
...Rebecca and I
found each other.

37:23.174 --> 37:26.712
And we filled a hole
in each other's lives.

37:26.745 --> 37:29.581
Now, you don't have to be
happy for us,

37:29.615 --> 37:33.785
but we're not gonna apologize
for being together.

37:33.819 --> 37:37.456
So take all the shots
at me that you want to,

37:37.489 --> 37:39.925
leave me out
of the family vacations,

37:39.958 --> 37:41.827
leave me out
of the inside jokes,

37:41.860 --> 37:44.296
but the one time a decade
that you see Rebecca,

37:44.330 --> 37:48.033
you show my wife some respect.

38:04.550 --> 38:05.984
Does anyone know the score
of the football game?

38:06.017 --> 38:08.019
It's 21 to 7.

38:13.559 --> 38:17.496
Don't tell Mom and Dad
about... you know.

38:19.197 --> 38:22.200
I won't, but Tess...

38:22.233 --> 38:24.636
your parents are going
to love you no matter what.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.338
So you should tell them.

38:35.013 --> 38:36.448
Hey, Babe.

38:36.482 --> 38:38.950
-Uh...

38:38.984 --> 38:41.820
This is what happens
when you leave me

38:41.853 --> 38:43.555
by myself to handle
Thanksgiving dinner.

38:43.589 --> 38:47.225
The trouble started when the
cranberry sauce boiled over,

38:47.258 --> 38:49.495
it exploded all over me,
and then the trouble ended

38:49.528 --> 38:51.797
when I went to baste the turkey,
then dropped the turkey,

38:51.830 --> 38:55.401
then stepped onto,
nay, into the turkey.

38:55.434 --> 38:57.503
So I had to improvise.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.006
You know what this is?

39:01.039 --> 39:02.908
A disaster.

39:02.941 --> 39:05.577
No.

39:05.611 --> 39:08.179
This is, like,
Jack Pearson-level magic.

39:08.213 --> 39:09.581
Blasphemy.

39:09.615 --> 39:12.183
-Take it, you take it back.
-I will not.

39:12.217 --> 39:14.686
I will not.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.488
How's Tess?

39:16.522 --> 39:18.189
* When there's no choice...

39:18.223 --> 39:21.427
She's... she's fine.

39:21.460 --> 39:22.661
I think I did okay.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.863
* And how do I...

39:24.896 --> 39:26.532
RANDALL:
So although I have great respect

39:26.565 --> 39:28.600
for your university,
I find the premise

39:28.634 --> 39:30.436
of your question to be flawed.

39:30.469 --> 39:34.406
No one person has had the
greatest impact on my life.

39:34.440 --> 39:37.509
No one person can be my MVP,
my most valuable person.

39:37.543 --> 39:38.577
Oof.

39:38.610 --> 39:41.179
Shh. Hush. Go on, honey.

39:41.212 --> 39:44.115
A British anthropologist named

39:44.149 --> 39:46.685
Robin Dunbar wrote
we meet approximately

39:46.718 --> 39:48.754
three new people a day.

39:48.787 --> 39:50.522
That's 1,095 people a year.

39:50.556 --> 39:53.559
I'm 17, which means I've met

39:53.592 --> 39:56.595
18,615 people so far, so how
I'm I supposed to pick

39:56.628 --> 39:58.764
the most impactful one
out of 18,000?

39:58.797 --> 40:01.767
-Good morning Vietnam!

40:01.800 --> 40:04.302
Sorry.

40:04.335 --> 40:06.137
-I can't stop doing that.
-He really can't.

40:06.171 --> 40:07.573
YOUNG RANDALL:
Now you might say, "Randall,

40:07.606 --> 40:09.641
most of these people
are essentially strangers."

40:09.675 --> 40:10.876
Happy Thanksgiving.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.077
YOUNG RANDALL:
But...

40:12.110 --> 40:13.579
everyone starts off

40:13.612 --> 40:15.180
as an essential stranger,
right?

40:17.949 --> 40:22.788
* We would see a sign, oh...

40:22.821 --> 40:25.256
I hope you like pecan pie.

40:25.290 --> 40:27.125
I do.

40:28.460 --> 40:31.763
Um, relax, William.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.164
She's my cousin.

40:33.198 --> 40:35.266
* Well I've been running...

40:35.300 --> 40:38.970
I'm cool.

40:39.004 --> 40:42.974
* From the ashes we left

40:44.442 --> 40:49.515
* Forgiveness speaks
for itself *

40:49.548 --> 40:51.950
* But how can I forget?

40:55.821 --> 41:00.358
* When there's a stain

41:00.391 --> 41:03.228
* On it all

41:06.698 --> 41:09.100
* But what if I need you

41:09.134 --> 41:13.805
* In my darkest hour...

41:16.675 --> 41:17.976
-RANDALL: Hey!

41:18.009 --> 41:20.512
* What if it turns out...

41:20.546 --> 41:21.980
Grandpa!

41:22.013 --> 41:23.849
Hey! Hello.

41:23.882 --> 41:25.817
* There is no other...

41:25.851 --> 41:27.819
Happy Thanksgiving!

41:27.853 --> 41:29.287
Happy Thanksgiving to you!

41:29.320 --> 41:30.689
How're you doing, Grandpa?

41:30.722 --> 41:32.057
-I'm great.

41:32.090 --> 41:34.492
I was left at a fire station
by my birth father,

41:34.526 --> 41:36.528
and then I was found
by a fireman who took me

41:36.562 --> 41:40.532
to a hospital, where a doctor
showed me to my father,

41:40.566 --> 41:42.534
who showed me to my mother.

41:42.568 --> 41:44.570
* Well, I've been running...

41:44.603 --> 41:47.072
YOUNG RANDALL:
My story is unique,
and I feel like

41:47.105 --> 41:49.675
it's like that for everyone.

41:49.708 --> 41:52.210
Strangers can be
your most impactful people.

41:52.243 --> 41:54.379
Acquaintances can be
your most impactful people.

41:54.412 --> 41:56.882
Family can be
the most impactful.

41:56.915 --> 41:59.317
And that's why
I can't pick the person

41:59.350 --> 42:00.919
who's had the greatest impact
on my life

42:00.952 --> 42:04.756
and why I think
your question is flawed.

42:04.790 --> 42:07.893
But if you insist
on me answering,

42:07.926 --> 42:10.095
if it's the only way
I can gain entrance

42:10.128 --> 42:13.364
to your storied university...

42:13.398 --> 42:14.766
I choose the fireman.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.702
-Okay.

42:16.735 --> 42:20.005
REBECCA:
Wow. Beautiful.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.272
You're in, son.

42:21.306 --> 42:22.941
* My darkest hour

42:22.974 --> 42:24.309
* And what if it...

42:32.083 --> 42:33.985
