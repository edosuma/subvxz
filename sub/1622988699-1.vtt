13:43.197 --> 13:45.574
[detective] So why don't you just portal
out of here?

13:45.658 --> 13:47.701
Um, I'm kind of spent.

13:48.285 --> 13:50.913
So there are these three super wizards,

13:51.580 --> 13:53.749
who created everything in the universe.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.585
That's the look
my science teacher gave us.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.922
Nari's naughty by nature,
Skrael's got that cool ice,

14:00.005 --> 14:02.508
and Bellroc, ooh, watch out for that fire.

14:02.591 --> 14:06.470
And I think they're mad
because we screwed up the planet.

14:06.554 --> 14:09.265
They stole these Genesis Seals
that lock away evil.

14:09.348 --> 14:12.768
Once the wizards get their powers together
in one place, look out,

14:12.851 --> 14:15.187

14:16.939 --> 14:19.358

-Whoa. How you doing that?
-Nature is a melody the Earth can hear.

14:29.159 --> 14:31.787
This is real. We're your only chance.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.248
[detective] You can stop doing that.
Stop it!

14:34.331 --> 14:35.749
Woo!

You kids,

15:12.036 --> 15:13.203
We're very sorry.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.247
Nature is mother to us all.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.416
You can say that again, again, again...

15:17.499 --> 15:19.543
-Oh, no.
-What's going on, kitty?

15:19.627 --> 15:21.337
Again, again, again--

15:21.420 --> 15:23.339
Move along. Nothing to see here.

15:23.422 --> 15:26.926
Throw the book at them. Murder one.
Or two? Do I hear three? Sold.

-Excuse me?
-Freeze. Now melt. Thaw.

Careful, honey.
You have three bruised ribs.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.017
It must hurt like mad.

Every hero in the annals of history
has faced dark hours, Young Atlas.

17:28.088 --> 17:33.969
In such moments, it's important
to recognize one's limitations.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.263
What are you saying?

17:36.346 --> 17:41.685
Perhaps you should consider
staying behind the lines.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.145

The Arcane Order.

three Titans were their handmaidens
to the birth of the universe.

22:14.583 --> 22:19.379
They have been in stasis for a millennia,
awaiting a reckoning of epic proportions.

22:19.463 --> 22:23.175
A reckoning this world,
or any other, has never seen.

22:23.258 --> 22:26.428
When they combine
in the center of the universe,

22:26.511 --> 22:30.432

Don't tell me
they're going to destroy the Earth.

The opposite. They will erase all life,
burn the oceans, flood the cities.

22:43.111 --> 22:44.696
That's destroying it.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.657
No, it's a new start.
Life will begin again.

Life will start anew.

That's a joyous spin.

Where is the center of the universe?

22:53.663 --> 22:55.874
You are very familiar with it.

22:56.708 --> 23:01.797
We don't technically have a school.
That doesn't mean we can't learn.

-Of the universe.

They need her
to complete the ritual, correct?

23:19.231 --> 23:22.025
All three primordial wizards
must be present, correct.

26:07.148 --> 26:09.150

26:13.446 --> 26:14.406
[Toby] And he's back.

26:14.489 --> 26:16.157
I think you said,

26:16.241 --> 26:19.452
"Trollhunter make Ninth Configuration.

26:19.536 --> 26:22.163
-Krohnisfere will make right."
-Huh?

26:22.247 --> 26:26.543
-What's the Ninth Configuration?
-What you said. Or she said.

26:26.626 --> 26:28.003
Uh, whoever said it.

26:28.086 --> 26:31.423
Ninth Configuration?
Sounds like an '80s boy band.

26:31.506 --> 26:34.384
But she said "Trollhunter."
Jim, you must know.

26:34.467 --> 26:37.762
I don't.
I'm not the Trollhunter anymore, remember?

26:39.597 --> 26:41.391
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.980
[enchanting music playing]

26:47.689 --> 26:49.190
[Jim] Whoa.

26:49.858 --> 26:53.236
You guys fixed my amulet.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.447
Actually, it's new and improved.

26:55.530 --> 26:57.866
Built from Merlin's own blueprints.

26:57.949 --> 27:00.910
And a piece of Heartstone
from our homeworld.

27:01.703 --> 27:02.662
Have you tested it?

27:02.746 --> 27:05.457
How could we? You're the Trollhunter.

27:05.540 --> 27:08.209
[Jim] "For the good of all..."

27:08.793 --> 27:09.753
Huh.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.922
Thank you for this.

27:13.006 --> 27:16.217
I'll need it.
Douxie, where is the Arcane Order?

27:16.301 --> 27:19.346
-Jim, you're hurt.
-They're about to summon the Titans.

27:19.429 --> 27:20.889
Did you see where they are?

27:20.972 --> 27:22.599
It was dark.

27:22.682 --> 27:24.267
Someplace circular.

27:24.351 --> 27:25.643
That narrows it down.

27:25.727 --> 27:29.939
There were seven large doors,
and rails on the ground.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.983
Rails, rails.

27:32.067 --> 27:36.112
Circular. It's a roundhouse.

27:36.196 --> 27:38.531
-That gives us something to go on.
-Yes.

27:39.032 --> 27:41.826
Over 3000 somethings
in North America alone.

27:41.910 --> 27:44.704
Or I can lock on to Nari
and portal us there.

27:46.915 --> 27:47.957
Um, uh...

27:48.041 --> 27:49.334
I can do that.

27:50.085 --> 27:52.670
[yells] Yeah!

27:56.174 --> 27:57.092
Where are they?

27:57.175 --> 28:00.303

She should be right here.

28:00.387 --> 28:01.888
She's right.

28:01.971 --> 28:05.683
The bricks, the masonry.
It's the right place, just--

28:05.767 --> 28:07.227
We don't have time to guess.

28:07.310 --> 28:10.271
Everyone, start searching.

Ai-yai-yai.

28:22.409 --> 28:23.952
I'm afraid they're not here.

28:24.035 --> 28:25.495
But they were here.

28:27.622 --> 28:31.584
Bloody balroths, the train tracks.
Maybe they still are.

28:33.128 --> 28:36.631
They didn't leave this place.
It's an illusion.

28:36.714 --> 28:39.759
Just as the amulet
mechanizes an incantation,

28:39.843 --> 28:41.136
the train tracks...

28:41.219 --> 28:46.516
The train tracks. Look, they're a sigil.
A giant mechanical invocation.

-Does it show?

39:50.137 --> 39:53.724
You're with me.
Always have been, always will be.

39:53.808 --> 39:56.018
And I could use some moral support.

39:56.102 --> 39:58.437
Ah. The lamest of the superpowers.

40:01.607 --> 40:04.318
[mystical music playing]

40:07.613 --> 40:10.991
Well, look who's returned.

40:11.075 --> 40:14.703
Not busy saving the world today, son?

40:14.787 --> 40:18.332
If only you knew. We're looking
for something called the Krohnisfere.

40:18.416 --> 40:22.294
-[growls] Turn around, Archibald.
-You've heard of it?

40:22.378 --> 40:26.715
The Krohnisfere
holds the power of time infinite

40:26.799 --> 40:30.845
-and tells of the past and future.
-[gasps]

40:30.928 --> 40:34.557
Zong-Shi never averts his gaze from it.

40:34.640 --> 40:39.311
He's convinced it'll show him
the moment of his demise.

40:39.395 --> 40:42.314
I don't need to find that ill-fated relic

40:42.398 --> 40:46.986
to know only death will come
to those who go looking for it.

40:47.069 --> 40:50.698
[Archie] Well, if you don't want
to spend time with your son, then don't.

40:50.781 --> 40:54.201
Hmm. Will your cowardly friends
be with you?

40:54.285 --> 40:57.496
Including the troll with many eyes?

40:57.580 --> 40:59.457
The one that screams a lot?

40:59.540 --> 41:00.583
Yes.

41:00.666 --> 41:02.126
In that case...

41:02.209 --> 41:04.211
[screaming]

41:10.968 --> 41:13.387
-[screaming continues]
-[Archie] Oh, relax, Blinky.

41:13.471 --> 41:16.348
Don't you know,
flying's the safest form of travel?

41:16.432 --> 41:19.685
I don't think aging dragons
are included in those statistics.

41:19.768 --> 41:22.730
"Aging"? I'm experienced.

41:22.813 --> 41:26.525
-Trust me. [laughing]
-[screaming]

41:27.401 --> 41:30.946
-All right, all right. I trust you.
-[laughing continues]

41:31.030 --> 41:33.866
I simply love it when he screams.

41:33.949 --> 41:36.118
[Claire] Thanks for the assist,
Mr. Charlemagne,

41:36.202 --> 41:40.372
but didn't your son tell you I could've
used my magic to shorten the trip?

41:40.456 --> 41:46.337
Where would be the fun in that?
Plus, TrollDragons are wary of sorcery.

41:46.420 --> 41:49.882
Their lair is resistant to shadow magic.

41:49.965 --> 41:53.844
So we'll have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

41:53.928 --> 41:54.845
[yelps]

41:55.596 --> 41:58.682
[Charlemagne]
Welcome to Stonecarver Bridge.

42:00.059 --> 42:05.397
Our way into the TrollMarket
is through there!

42:05.481 --> 42:07.483

-Oh?
-Oh, sweet terra firma.

42:26.001 --> 42:28.379
-[laughing]
-Mwah. Oh, I missed you.

42:28.462 --> 42:29.463
<i>Avant!</i>

42:30.548 --> 42:31.840
No shadow magic,

42:31.924 --> 42:35.511
but we are in possession of a horngazel.

42:35.594 --> 42:38.264
-[laughs]

[pilot in Mandarin]

42:43.060 --> 42:46.814
-[roars]
-No, don't. They think you're bad guys.

42:46.897 --> 42:48.816
They're the ones pointing weapons.

42:48.899 --> 42:50.192
Brave aviators.

42:50.276 --> 42:52.611
Curious eyes, merciful ears.

42:52.695 --> 42:54.071
Though what appears before you

42:54.154 --> 42:57.408
is undoubtedly monstrous,
it pales in comparison for what is next.

[pilot]

43:01.579 --> 43:03.831
[in Mandarin]

43:03.914 --> 43:06.750
But our fate is entwined
and predicated on peace.

Love is the one--

Blinky!

43:25.894 --> 43:27.062
Charlemagne!

43:27.771 --> 43:28.731
Let's go.

43:35.070 --> 43:36.155
[Blinky groans]

43:39.783 --> 43:43.495
Descriptions of this place
hardly do it justice.

43:43.579 --> 43:45.831
Holy frijole.

43:45.914 --> 43:47.124
Indeed.

43:47.207 --> 43:50.002
"Holy frijole" will have to suffice.

43:51.086 --> 43:53.088
[enchanting music playing]

44:00.638 --> 44:04.516
[Charlemagne] What is beauty,
if at the cost of others?

44:04.600 --> 44:07.728
Zong-Shi wants everything,

44:07.811 --> 44:10.064
even time itself.

44:10.147 --> 44:13.359
All these trolls held against their will.

44:13.442 --> 44:14.985
And for what?

44:15.069 --> 44:17.279
He tries to avoid death,

44:17.363 --> 44:20.908
<i>while everyone around him dies.</i>

44:20.991 --> 44:24.411
Ah, Charlemagne.

44:24.495 --> 44:27.373
You finally paid me a visit.

44:28.999 --> 44:30.709
[Claire] I just have one question.

44:30.793 --> 44:34.588
If this TrollDragon you know
never takes his eyes off the Krohnisfere,

44:34.672 --> 44:36.382
how are we supposed to steal it?

44:36.465 --> 44:39.343
[Charlemagne] I figured you'd tell me.

44:39.426 --> 44:40.969
[dramatic music playing]

44:41.679 --> 44:44.014
Halt, outsiders.

44:45.265 --> 44:46.225
-Oh, dear.
-[gasps]

44:46.308 --> 44:47.935
Cut the pleasantries.

44:48.018 --> 44:50.312
Just take us to your leader.

44:52.981 --> 44:55.359
Krel's coordinates show
we should be on top of it.

44:55.442 --> 44:58.237
-Maybe his numbers are off.
-What would they be on?

44:58.320 --> 44:59.363
[ice rumbles]

44:59.446 --> 45:01.407
[gasps] Iceberg!

45:02.699 --> 45:04.076
[Jim] That's no iceberg.

45:04.159 --> 45:04.993
[gasps]

45:05.661 --> 45:07.037
I've got this.

45:07.788 --> 45:09.790
[dramatic music playing]

45:16.380 --> 45:18.257
I hope the others are doing better.

Then again, flying is overrated.

-Jim.
-I know, Mom.

47:49.825 --> 47:51.243
I'll be careful.

Careful, Young Atlas.

[Strickler] You know, Jim,

49:37.182 --> 49:38.975
I once tried to kill you.

49:39.059 --> 49:40.519
I really did.

49:41.311 --> 49:43.355
And now, well,

49:43.438 --> 49:46.441
I've never felt so good about failing.

49:46.525 --> 49:48.902
No. No! [groaning]

49:48.985 --> 49:51.405
I should've played it safe like you said.

49:51.488 --> 49:53.740
I was wrong, Young Atlas.

49:53.824 --> 49:59.621
To ask you not to be a hero
is like asking the sun not to rise.

Take care of Barbara for me, Young Atlas.

51:14.446 --> 51:15.947
I'm sorry.

He was trying to save me,
and it didn't even stop the Titan.

This is all my fault.

No, Jim.

That you never give up.

That you see things through.

You always have.

Not like your father.

We never talk about him.

There's really nothing
I can tell you, Jim.

No big revelation I can give you.

You will always have me,

And your hide will hang here as my trophy.

1:09:40.509 --> 1:09:41.719
Nari.

1:09:42.678 --> 1:09:43.929
[Douxie] Nari!

1:09:44.555 --> 1:09:45.389
Nari.

1:09:45.472 --> 1:09:47.892
[somber music playing]

1:10:01.906 --> 1:10:02.740
Nari.

1:10:08.913 --> 1:10:11.790
[Nari]<i> No more running.</i>

1:10:14.710 --> 1:10:16.045

1:10:16.795 --> 1:10:17.671
[sniffles]

1:10:18.881 --> 1:10:20.049
She did it.

1:10:20.925 --> 1:10:23.302
Nari stopped them from uniting.

1:10:24.803 --> 1:10:27.640
[Krel] <i>Apparently the Fire Titan</i>
<i>did not get the memo.</i>

1:10:27.723 --> 1:10:29.683
-Seklos and Gaylen.
-What?

1:10:29.767 --> 1:10:31.268
It's still marching.

1:10:32.686 --> 1:10:34.521
It's approaching Arcadia.

1:10:34.605 --> 1:10:37.399
But why? The three can no longer unite.

1:10:37.483 --> 1:10:40.110
Blinky, you're sure
you read the grimoire right?

1:10:40.194 --> 1:10:41.028
Of course.

1:10:41.111 --> 1:10:44.406
"When the three unite,
Earth will be reborn,

1:10:44.490 --> 1:10:47.534
back to the age of first creation,"
you see?

1:10:48.494 --> 1:10:50.204
Uh-- Huh?

1:10:52.665 --> 1:10:53.499

"That will be the element
from which the world will be reborn."

1:11:03.050 --> 1:11:06.220
You forgot to turn the page?

1:11:06.303 --> 1:11:08.889
It was stuck and moldy.

1:11:08.973 --> 1:11:11.016
And you didn't notice?

1:11:11.100 --> 1:11:13.644
You've got six eyes.

1:11:13.727 --> 1:11:15.896
The world was ending. I was rushed.

1:11:15.980 --> 1:11:17.940
That's why the Titans came to Arcadia.

1:11:18.023 --> 1:11:22.444
They didn't have to unite with each other.
They have to unite with the Heartstone.

1:11:22.528 --> 1:11:26.615
That actually makes horrible sense.

1:11:26.699 --> 1:11:30.661
The reason all of these trolls,
extraterrestrials, wizards

1:11:30.744 --> 1:11:34.415
happened to come here
is because under Arcadia

1:11:34.498 --> 1:11:38.544
is the only surviving
primordial Heartstone.

1:11:38.627 --> 1:11:43.173
As I said,
Arcadia is the center of the universe.

1:11:43.257 --> 1:11:46.218
[man] You heard him.
I want Arcadia Oaks cleared now.

1:11:46.302 --> 1:11:48.220
[woman] This way, straight ahead.

[coach] No! No more danger!

1:12:12.202 --> 1:12:14.663
Is there nowhere safe?!

1:12:15.748 --> 1:12:16.874
No, look out.

1:12:22.463 --> 1:12:23.672
[Jim]<i> You got Excalibur?</i>

1:12:23.756 --> 1:12:27.176
Yeah, we've got it,
and a little something-something.

-[Jim] <i>Meet us in Arcadia.</i>
-[Stuart] Okay, right.

1:12:29.553 --> 1:12:33.098

We just came from there.

[horn blares "La Cucaracha"]

1:12:41.857 --> 1:12:46.362
Yeah, now that's the way
you greet a taco truck.

1:12:46.445 --> 1:12:48.697
[sergeant] Move those barricades,
corporal.

1:12:48.781 --> 1:12:50.199
[corporal] Right away, sir.

1:12:52.242 --> 1:12:54.244
[dramatic music playing]

1:12:59.792 --> 1:13:02.127
-Go on, Jimbo. Take it.
-You got this.

1:13:03.629 --> 1:13:05.297
[Douxie] Come on, Jim. This is it.

1:13:05.381 --> 1:13:08.592
-This is your destiny.
-Go, Jim, go. Go, Jim, go.

1:13:08.675 --> 1:13:09.551
You can do it.

1:13:10.969 --> 1:13:12.721
[Blinky] Yes, pull.

1:13:17.017 --> 1:13:18.769
Come on, come on, come on.

1:13:18.852 --> 1:13:20.312

1:13:20.396 --> 1:13:23.107
[whimpers] I can't watch. [sobs]

1:13:29.905 --> 1:13:30.906
[winces]

1:13:31.740 --> 1:13:34.284
I really thought that was going to work.

1:13:35.744 --> 1:13:38.705
[sighs] We gave your plan a try.

1:13:39.498 --> 1:13:42.418
When my ships arrive, we will evacuate.

Oh, my gosh. [yelps]

1:13:51.552 --> 1:13:52.678
Now what?

1:14:07.025 --> 1:14:09.528
[Douxie] Oh, fuzzbuckets.

1:14:21.582 --> 1:14:22.749
[screaming]

1:14:23.459 --> 1:14:26.253
By Gorgus! What else could go wrong?

1:14:26.336 --> 1:14:28.881
Take that back.
Childbirth's a beautiful thing.

1:14:28.964 --> 1:14:33.177
You cannot fight in this state,
my beautiful spherical Steve.

1:14:33.260 --> 1:14:35.429
But I can't leave him like this.

1:14:35.512 --> 1:14:36.430
Don't worry.

1:14:36.513 --> 1:14:37.848
I'll be by his side.

1:14:38.807 --> 1:14:43.479
Wait, Aja.
Where do Akiridion babies come out of?

1:14:44.062 --> 1:14:45.522
They come out of... [whispers]

"The Trollhunter will know..."
What do I know?

1:14:59.953 --> 1:15:03.540
"The Ninth Configuration."
Okay, nine. What is...?

1:15:03.624 --> 1:15:04.958
Ninth Configuration?

1:15:05.042 --> 1:15:07.127
The Ninth Configuration.

1:15:07.669 --> 1:15:11.840
[sighs] The Ninth Configuration.

1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:15.802
[stirring music playing]

1:15:22.893 --> 1:15:26.438
The configuration is us.

1:15:26.522 --> 1:15:30.317
-The nine of us.
-We can pull Excalibur together.

1:15:34.530 --> 1:15:36.949
Everyone, put your hands on the stone.

1:15:37.032 --> 1:15:38.325
Surround me.

1:16:23.870 --> 1:16:27.207
Oh, I knew I shouldn't have taken
that bathroom break.

1:16:27.791 --> 1:16:32.004
[Jim] Take this back to Camelot.
Replace the amulet stone with Merlin's.

1:16:32.087 --> 1:16:34.798
I know it goes unsaid, but make it quick.

1:16:34.881 --> 1:16:36.216
Okay, right.

1:16:42.431 --> 1:16:44.141
"Destiny is a gift."

1:16:44.224 --> 1:16:46.893
Our loved ones gave their lives,

1:16:46.977 --> 1:16:51.356
but we are here
in this very moment of quiet desperation.

1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:55.402
We've learned that what feels like
a burden pushing down on our shoulders...

1:16:55.485 --> 1:17:00.324
Is actually a sense of purpose
that lifts us to greater heights.

1:17:00.407 --> 1:17:03.118
Wait, are you guys doing
that "hero speech" thing?

1:17:03.201 --> 1:17:04.995
I love the "hero speech" thing.

1:17:05.078 --> 1:17:09.041
Never forget that fear
is but the precursor to valor.

1:17:09.124 --> 1:17:12.127
That to strive
and triumph in the face of fear

1:17:12.210 --> 1:17:13.712
is what makes us heroes.

1:17:13.795 --> 1:17:15.255
Don't think.

Ah, how I've missed driving. [laughs]

1:17:42.824 --> 1:17:45.911
If we stop Bellroc,
we'll stop the Fire Titan.

1:17:45.994 --> 1:17:48.038
Blinky, we need to be right next to it.

1:17:48.121 --> 1:17:52.376
You want us to get on top of that thing?
I can't get to the top of the rope in gym.

1:17:52.459 --> 1:17:55.087
Don't worry, I've got just the thing.

Varvatos approves.

1:18:11.436 --> 1:18:13.939

that magic on a little too thick.

No, I'm right where I need to be.

Then you will die alone.

You have no amulet, no armor.

1:23:56.031 --> 1:24:00.660

1:24:09.127 --> 1:24:10.670
[dramatic music playing]

1:24:11.296 --> 1:24:14.090
The amulet didn't make me a hero.

1:24:14.174 --> 1:24:15.759
I already was.

1:26:29.809 --> 1:26:30.810
Give up.

1:29:07.342 --> 1:29:08.426
It was Toby.

Yeah, we did.

1:30:03.981 --> 1:30:05.566
Tobes, we'll fix you.

1:30:05.650 --> 1:30:09.153
We'll get you a doctor

No, there's gotta be a way.

There's always a way.

Use this. You can't just give up.

I'm not giving up, Jimbo.

1:30:23.835 --> 1:30:25.128
You taught me that.

1:30:26.337 --> 1:30:28.798
You all taught me so much,

Please, Tobes, you can't leave me.

You've always been with me.

It'll be the two of us at the end.

It's okay, Jimbo.

1:30:59.912 --> 1:31:01.414
I didn't think.

1:31:01.497 --> 1:31:02.957

What do you mean?

"Time unfolds differently, like a flower."

things will happen differently.

And maybe it'll be worse.

We barely saved the world this time.

Master Jim, if you do this,

1:33:12.378 --> 1:33:16.299
you alone will be burdened
by what could have been.

1:33:16.382 --> 1:33:19.677

I have cherished every moment with you.

In these few years,
you have grown into a man.

Um... okay.

-Hang on.
