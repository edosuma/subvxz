00:08.680 --> 00:10.920
There's a sustainable atmosphere.

00:11.080 --> 00:14.040
Temperature's 78Â°F,
barometric pressure is normal.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.200
No obvious signs of civilisation.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.920
P4X-884 looks like
an untouched paradise, sir.

00:19.080 --> 00:21.000
Appearances may be deceiving.

00:21.160 --> 00:25.680
- One man's ceiling is another man's floor.
- A fool's paradise is a wise man's hell.

00:25.840 --> 00:27.800
Never run with scissors?

00:27.960 --> 00:31.680
- Were you trying to make a point, Major?
- Yes, sir.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.240
We should perform a recon mission.

00:34.400 --> 00:38.720
Mineral and biological survey - to see if
884 is a viable site for a research colony.

00:38.880 --> 00:43.600
- Very well. You have a go.
- Mmm! Mineral survey. My favourite!

00:43.760 --> 00:45.880
- Colonel.
- I know, General.

00:46.040 --> 00:49.560
It's all fun and games
until someone breaks a nail.

01:01.920 --> 01:04.120
Au revoir, mon general.

01:05.200 --> 01:11.240
- I am unfamiliar with that term, O'Neill.
- Au revoir. It's French. It means ciao.

01:11.400 --> 01:15.440
Ciao means adios.
Auf Wiedersehen. Sayonara.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.720
Which all, loosely translated, mean...

01:26.760 --> 01:27.920
..goodbye?

01:28.080 --> 01:30.040
Stand down.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.280
What happened?

01:36.360 --> 01:39.840
- What happened?
- That's what I just asked you.

01:42.960 --> 01:45.560
Will someone please explain?

01:45.720 --> 01:50.920
General, we just left. We went through
the gate and we came back... here.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.400
Major, you've been gone over 1 5 hours.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.200
Blood work is normal.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.680
So far, you check out fine.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.200
What about the lost time?

03:13.360 --> 03:15.680
Could we have been
drugged with something?

03:15.840 --> 03:21.440
There's no new marks on your skin to
indicate injections or any kind of struggle.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.200
What's the last thing you remember?

03:24.360 --> 03:26.400
We were walking up the ramp.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.800
O'Neill was explaining
the meaning of ciao.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.880
We stepped through,
we stepped back through.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.920
That's... what happened
as far as we're concerned.

03:35.080 --> 03:38.040
When you didn't come back,
we sent a second MALP.

03:38.200 --> 03:41.480
All it showed was the same image
of the alien planet we saw before.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.800
There was no sign of you
and no response to our radio call.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.480
That's why there were two MALPs
in the gate room.

03:47.760 --> 03:51.080
Both came back just before you.
We assumed you sent them.

03:51.240 --> 03:53.360
It wasn't us, sir.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.960
This is the Mark Il MALP's transmission.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.240
- That's what we saw, Major.
- Yes, sir. Same as the first.

04:13.400 --> 04:14.840
Except where is it?

04:15.000 --> 04:20.040
If this is the second MALP, we should see
the first MALP near the Stargate.

04:20.680 --> 04:24.440
Isn't that thing supposed to...
probe a little?

04:24.600 --> 04:28.480
Well, then there'd be tracks, sir,
and there are none in this image.

04:28.640 --> 04:32.200
Watch what happens when you run
the playback frame by frame.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.680
There.

04:40.040 --> 04:42.640
- (Jackson) Hello.
- What is it?

04:42.800 --> 04:45.720
I'm not sure. Their technology
is advanced beyond ours.

04:46.080 --> 04:50.240
- Then the previous image was faked?
- There's no other explanation, sir.

04:50.520 --> 04:54.360
The images portraying this planet
seem to have been manufactured...

04:54.520 --> 04:58.040
- ..and then broadcast back to us.
- (Hammond) Why?

04:58.200 --> 05:01.520
Possibly with the intended purpose
of luring us into this room.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.960
See? I knew it was too good to be true.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.680
Wow! This coffee's great.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.440
I was just thinking that.

05:10.280 --> 05:13.840
- Yeah, is that cinnamon?
- It's, uh... it's chicory.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.040
Mmm, chicory.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.400
Teal'c?

05:27.800 --> 05:28.920
Ah!

05:29.360 --> 05:31.920
- Isn't that hot?
- Extremely.

05:37.560 --> 05:40.600
Just... stay on the base.

05:42.720 --> 05:46.400
We're going to need to keep an eye
on you for the time being.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.400
- I feel fine.
- As do l, Daniel Jackson.

05:49.880 --> 05:53.880
For someone who just drank
half a gallon of steaming hot coffee!

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Right.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.960
- Hungry?
- Yeah.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.240
Try the pie.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.560
So I'm running a full diagnostic on that...

07:17.440 --> 07:19.360
- Wow!
- Oh, yeah.

07:19.760 --> 07:23.880
- This is the best pie I've ever had.
- Well, what's so different about it?

07:24.360 --> 07:27.840
- Same old pie.
- It is most satisfying.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.920
- Why do they taste so good?
- I don't know.

07:35.840 --> 07:39.640
All I do know is...
I don't even like yoghurt.

07:40.880 --> 07:43.200
(Tannoy) SG-1, report to med lab 3.

07:50.640 --> 07:53.520
Wait. Sorry... Sorry.

07:57.840 --> 08:02.360
(Dr Fraiser) The scans have a percentage
of error. It looks like an errant pixel.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.920
But it's in the same place
on each of the scans.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.760
Yeah. Thank you.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.600
So I had to run
a comparative analysis to be sure.

08:09.760 --> 08:13.760
It's in the exact same spot
in each of your brains but...

08:13.920 --> 08:16.880
..you're talking about something
smaller than a pinhead.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.960
Barely large enough to show on an X-ray.

08:19.120 --> 08:23.440
Right. Which is why I also needed
to run an electron resonance scan, and...

08:26.640 --> 08:30.800
This is, uh,
magnified several thousand times, sir.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.799
That thing's in all of us?

08:40.919 --> 08:43.240
I'm afraid so.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.120
Can these devices be removed?

08:55.280 --> 08:58.440
Not without causing
irreparable brain damage, sir.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.480
What's the downside?

09:00.640 --> 09:04.960
How they were implanted without
any injury to the cortex is beyond me.

09:05.200 --> 09:10.440
- What threat do they pose?
- All desserts on base are in grave danger.

09:10.680 --> 09:16.320
An electromagnetic field is being emitted.
But I'm not sure what that means.

09:16.480 --> 09:20.640
All we've noticed are some cravings
and an increased acuity in our senses.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.840
Especially taste and smell.

09:24.240 --> 09:28.680
Until we find out the true purpose
of these objects, I'm quarantining you...

09:28.840 --> 09:31.680
..with a 24-hour guard.

09:45.640 --> 09:47.440
(man) Boring!

09:49.280 --> 09:51.920
- Who said that?
- It wasn't me.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.360
What d'you say we all go do somethin'?

10:01.640 --> 10:02.960
Teal'c?

10:03.120 --> 10:05.200
- Did you hear that?
- I did.

10:08.320 --> 10:10.280
- Who's there?
- OK!

10:10.440 --> 10:14.320
I'll make it so that you can all see me,
but only because you asked.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.760
- You all can see me, right?
- Apparently.

10:21.920 --> 10:25.520
Oh, good, I'm so glad.
Hello, hello, hello. (chuckles)

10:25.680 --> 10:28.440
- Now you all say it.
- (all) Hello, Urgo.

10:28.600 --> 10:32.720
(laughs) You're all much better-looking
on the outside than on the inside.

10:32.880 --> 10:36.400
On the inside, it's so complicated.
Oooh, please!

10:40.280 --> 10:42.040
Airman!

10:42.200 --> 10:44.520
Could you come here?

10:46.960 --> 10:50.040
Do you see an intruder
in this room anywhere?

10:58.160 --> 11:00.080
No, sir.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.120
Right. Dismissed.

11:05.280 --> 11:07.600
(chuckles)

11:09.120 --> 11:11.600
- All right. What are you?
- Urgo.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.840
Which might explain why
we all just said "Hello, Urgo."

11:15.000 --> 11:18.040
- No, you are not dreaming.
- You read our thoughts?

11:18.200 --> 11:21.960
Don't panic. Just the thoughts
you're having at the moment.

11:22.120 --> 11:26.120
Of course.
You're... actually in our heads, aren't you?

11:26.280 --> 11:29.480
You are so smart, Samantha.
I love that about you!

11:29.640 --> 11:31.120
Carter?

11:31.280 --> 11:34.160
The technology
implanted in our brains, sir.

11:34.320 --> 11:38.440
We're looking at a visual communication
interface: controlled hallucination.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.240
So...

11:40.400 --> 11:41.960
I...

11:42.120 --> 11:45.440
- Uh... What?
- He gets confused!

11:46.040 --> 11:48.480
By the way, who is Mary Steenburgen?

11:48.640 --> 11:52.640
This is incredible. I mean,
the devices must be linked somehow.

11:52.800 --> 11:57.040
Dr Fraiser said they're emitting
a small EM field - Iike radio frequencies.

11:57.200 --> 12:00.840
The devices in our brain are
some sort of wireless computer network?

12:01.080 --> 12:05.880
Yeah, an incredibly sophisticated one,
able to work over significant distances.

12:06.040 --> 12:10.360
We were all drawn to the commissary
when Colonel O'Neill was eating dessert.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.760
- He can make us do stuff?
- No, never.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.080
In spite of what you're thinking, never.

12:15.240 --> 12:18.080
But you can make suggestions,
can't you?

12:18.280 --> 12:22.080
- And enhance our sensory perception.
- Like making things taste better.

12:22.240 --> 12:25.280
- Well, didn't it?
- Well, why not?

12:25.440 --> 12:29.120
I mean, he's tapped into our brains.
He's making us all see and hear him.

12:29.280 --> 12:32.480
Boring! By the way,
who decorated this room?

12:32.920 --> 12:34.880
It is so plain!

12:35.040 --> 12:38.440
Don't tell me your whole planet's
like this. Not the whole planet!

12:38.600 --> 12:42.440
Hey, couldn't we go someplace else -
that's not here?

12:42.600 --> 12:44.520
Someplace, y'know...

12:45.840 --> 12:47.480
..that's not here?

12:47.640 --> 12:49.600
Um... Kree!

12:49.760 --> 12:53.120
Anywhere. (whispers) Boring.

12:58.760 --> 13:01.880
OK. So what does he look like?

13:02.280 --> 13:05.000
A famous tenor.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.680
What's this?

13:06.840 --> 13:10.520
And you're seeing the exact same thing
at the exact same time?

13:10.680 --> 13:11.680
Yep.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.760
- What is this?
- It's a defibrillator.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.120
Ahhh, interesting. Thank you.

13:18.280 --> 13:21.560
Is it... defibrillating... now?

13:21.760 --> 13:25.480
He, um...
it seems to crave new experiences.

13:26.720 --> 13:30.880
The paddles administer a shock to people
whose hearts are beating irregularly.

13:31.040 --> 13:35.560
Ah! And then they feel better?
Does it feel good? Does it hurt?

13:35.720 --> 13:38.480
- Woo! It hurts!
- I would think so.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.960
- Let's try it.
- No, I don't think so.

13:41.120 --> 13:44.200
Why not?
It's not gonna kill you, is it? Or is it?

13:46.560 --> 13:47.920
It talks to you?

13:48.120 --> 13:52.360
It's experiencing things through us,
using our senses to collect information.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.440
Try the paddles.

13:54.680 --> 13:58.880
So do you experience any...
physi...cal sensations?

14:03.480 --> 14:04.520
Hey!

14:04.680 --> 14:07.640
- Teal'c!
- Will you loosen up?

14:07.840 --> 14:10.000
Hey... I'm loose.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.960
He doesn't have total control over us.
Just the power of suggestion.

14:16.240 --> 14:20.120
He can also enhance our enjoyment
of experiences in order to motivate us.

14:20.280 --> 14:21.240
Really?

14:21.400 --> 14:25.200
- He's unresponsive to direct questioning.
- No. No, that's not true.

14:25.360 --> 14:28.920
I'm picking your brains.
You can pick mine. I'll tell you anything.

14:29.080 --> 14:31.120
Ask me. Ask me anything. What? What?

14:31.320 --> 14:36.440
- How do we remove you from our brains?
- Oh... (blows raspberry) Except that!

14:36.600 --> 14:38.960
- Duh!
- You said anything.

14:39.120 --> 14:42.240
Why do you wanna remove me
from your brains? I'm in your brains.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.840
I know you like me. You can't fool me.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.640
No, Urgo. We don't like you.

14:47.760 --> 14:51.280
- Oh, admit it, tough guy. A smidgen?
- No smidgen.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.200
I wouldn't blame you.
I have endearing qualities.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.400
- He will not cooperate, O'Neill.
- Why, you...!

14:57.560 --> 15:00.960
Years from now,
when you think of me, you'll say...

15:01.120 --> 15:04.880
.."How did I ever get along without
that wonderful constant companion?"

15:05.040 --> 15:05.960
Woof.

15:06.120 --> 15:08.040
- Years from now?
- Woof?

15:08.200 --> 15:13.080
There is no way to remove me
from your brains. Forget about it.

15:13.560 --> 15:16.280
What are you doing there
in the first place?

15:16.440 --> 15:18.880
Well... (chuckles) She got it. You got it.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.960
I'm here to learn.
I'm here to experience your world.

15:22.160 --> 15:27.280
So we've been tagged - Iike we do with
wild animals when we wanna study them.

15:27.600 --> 15:31.080
- We are not wild animals.
- Speak for yourself, big fella.

15:31.240 --> 15:37.080
Hang on a second. The race who created
you and put these things in our brains.

15:37.240 --> 15:40.240
They're gonna want the information
you're collecting.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.000
- I suppose.
- So how do they get it?

15:44.040 --> 15:47.400
- You don't wanna know.
- Let's say I do.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.560
You will never have to find out.

15:50.720 --> 15:54.080
Aren't you programmed?
I mean, how can you defy your creators?

15:54.240 --> 15:59.360
Because they're evil, scary evil, and we
don't want anything to do with them.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.640
If we contact whoever created
the technology...

16:03.880 --> 16:06.160
That would be bad. Very bad.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.120
- Why should we listen to you?
- OK.

16:10.280 --> 16:15.640
I know you only like me a little bit, but I
like you a lot and I do not want you to die.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.600
- Die?
- Yes, as in dead. They're gonna kill ya.

16:19.760 --> 16:22.520
They open your brains
with a giant can-opener,...

16:22.680 --> 16:26.240
..and then they scoop me out
with a big scoopy thing.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.720
That's how it works.

16:28.880 --> 16:31.800
It's death... or me.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.360
Me or death. You have to decide.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.280
Me... or death.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.160
Well?

16:48.320 --> 16:50.240
We're thinking.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.680
(Urgo) Me me me me me-me me me-me

16:53.880 --> 16:56.800
Me, me, me me me

16:56.960 --> 16:58.760
Me me me me me-me-me

16:58.920 --> 17:01.640
Me-me me-me me me me me-me me

17:01.800 --> 17:04.200
(singing continues)

17:08.240 --> 17:11.160
- Will you stop it?
- Jeez!

17:19.800 --> 17:21.720
Please.

17:27.040 --> 17:30.120
So this technology
is living vicariously through you.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.840
I say we risk it all
and go back to the planet.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.640
What if he's telling the truth
about his creators?

17:36.800 --> 17:39.960
- There's no way to get him out of us here.
- No. No way.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.520
- No.
- See? (chuckles) She knows.

17:44.640 --> 17:48.080
Maybe there's another way.
I haven't studied the technology,...

17:48.240 --> 17:51.640
- ..but I can figure out how to turn him off.
- Turn me off?

17:52.040 --> 17:55.160
- Please.
- Don't waste your time. It's impossible!

17:56.920 --> 18:00.200
Hey! I got an idea.
Why don't we play hide-and-seek?

18:00.640 --> 18:03.040
You hide and I'll, you know...

18:03.680 --> 18:07.000
I'm not gonna cheat.
You know, cos I have... But I'm not...

18:07.160 --> 18:09.760
One, two, three...

18:09.920 --> 18:13.320
- Whatever you need, Major. Dismissed.
- Thank you.

18:13.480 --> 18:16.560
..six, seven, eight,...

18:17.240 --> 18:19.160
..nine, ten.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.720
I don't have time to play, Urgo.
I don't care if I'm "it".

18:38.880 --> 18:40.400
I have work to do!

18:40.560 --> 18:43.320
No, I am not hungry.
Go eat pie with Colonel O'Neill.

18:43.480 --> 18:46.840
- I'm very busy right now.
- Major.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.640
- Hi. I was just talking to Urgo, sir.
- I see.

18:49.800 --> 18:52.960
- Oh, I wish you did.
- Urgo, Major Carter would like...

18:53.120 --> 18:56.000
Uh, Janet, he's... over here.

18:56.160 --> 18:59.280
Well then, Urgo,
Major Carter would like to be left alone.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.800
Janet, um,
as much as I appreciate it, please...

19:02.960 --> 19:06.440
- Urgo, that is rude!
- What did he say?

19:06.600 --> 19:09.800
Uh... if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

19:13.280 --> 19:17.400
Doctor, are we entirely sure that the
members of SG-1 are... What's the word?

19:17.560 --> 19:19.280
- Sane?
- That's the one.

19:19.440 --> 19:22.600
Yes, sir. Everything we hear or see
is processed in the brain.

19:22.760 --> 19:26.240
Urgo is creating an image of himself
that they're responding to.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.880
If you say so.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.520
Way off. Not even close.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.000
Not a chance. Forget about it.

19:37.160 --> 19:39.720
- Carter.
- I believe I have a solution, sir.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.480
Please!

19:41.640 --> 19:46.400
The electromagnetic field indicates
these devices are based on electronics.

19:46.680 --> 19:50.680
- So smart and yet... so wrong.
- I don't think so.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.080
- An EM pulse should do it, sir.
- Ahhh!

19:53.240 --> 19:54.760
- Ow!
- Oh! Ooh.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.080
- Urgo, that's hot!
- I didn't mean to.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.440
Yes, you did. Now stop it.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.720
Urgo's been trying to distract me
since I started thinking about it,...

20:03.880 --> 20:05.880
..so I'm probably on the right track.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.600
I hope I didn't hurt you. I'm really sorry.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.920
- I'll live.
- She forgives me.

20:11.080 --> 20:14.800
A strong EM pulse can knock out
most electronic-based technologies.

20:14.960 --> 20:18.640
It would be harmless to us
but it should render Urgo impotent.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.800
Could you, uh... rephrase that? Uh...

20:22.600 --> 20:26.520
- Do it.
- (Urgo) Oh, please. Please don't do this.

20:26.680 --> 20:32.040
Hey, listen. I didn't mean to scald you.
I-l like you. I really, really do.

20:32.280 --> 20:34.880
Uh, please. It was an accident.

20:37.880 --> 20:41.800
This room is shielded, so it won't affect
any of the base's technology.

20:41.960 --> 20:45.720
Don't do this, please.
What can I do to make you like me?

20:47.760 --> 20:50.720
- You sure this won't hurt us?
- No. It's gonna hurt me.

20:51.240 --> 20:53.200
- We won't even feel it.
- But I will.

20:53.360 --> 20:57.360
I throw myself at your mercy.
Please, have mercy! (nervous laugh)

20:58.360 --> 21:00.320
Ooh, I know. I can be smaller.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.680
- How's this?
- Ready?

21:06.920 --> 21:10.200
I'm here. Look how teeny-weeny I am!

21:10.400 --> 21:14.000
How could anything this teeny-weeny
hurt anybody?

21:14.960 --> 21:17.560
Wait! I can be dull. Want me to be dull?

21:17.800 --> 21:22.160
What a nice grey. Want some white bread
with mayonnaise? Wanna watch golf?

21:22.320 --> 21:26.560
- Will you flip that switch?
- No. Oh. How about this?

21:27.520 --> 21:29.840
Can you resist this?

21:36.920 --> 21:39.840
Oh, don't do that. Oh, sacrebleu!

21:40.000 --> 21:44.440
I'm melting. I'm melting!
What a world! What a world...

21:45.280 --> 21:47.840
Pulse hasn't gone off yet. It's on a timer.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.920
Oh. How much time do l...

22:03.000 --> 22:05.480
- That's it?
- Yep.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.440
- I feel no differently.
- Listen.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.360
What?

22:10.520 --> 22:12.880
Exactly.

22:13.440 --> 22:16.200
Way to go, Sam.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.840
We'll see.

22:25.640 --> 22:30.080
The devices are still present, but the EM
field that was emitted by them is gone.

22:30.240 --> 22:31.920
Everything else checks out.

22:32.080 --> 22:35.400
Request permission for SG-1
to go back to work... sir.

22:38.560 --> 22:42.080
- Give it a week.
- A week?

22:52.680 --> 22:55.560
Well... everything looks normal.

22:57.040 --> 23:00.320
- How are you feeling?
- Great. I just wanna get back to work.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.520
Next weekend,
Cassandra and I are going to the lake...

23:03.680 --> 23:06.280
..and we're going to rent a rowboat.
Like to come?

23:06.440 --> 23:08.840
- Yeah, I'd love to.
- Great.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.720
- Can you send Daniel up next?
- Yeah. OK.

23:14.080 --> 23:17.240
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream

23:17.400 --> 23:19.640
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is...

23:19.960 --> 23:22.720
(O'Neill) ..merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream

23:22.880 --> 23:25.120
And row, row, row your boat...

23:25.280 --> 23:28.760
(Jackson) Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream

23:28.920 --> 23:31.040
Merrily, merrily, merrily...

23:31.200 --> 23:35.840
(Teal'c) Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream

23:36.000 --> 23:38.480
(all continue singing the round)

23:41.360 --> 23:45.800
I was not singing.
I'd know if I was singing.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.400
I don't even know the words to...

23:50.560 --> 23:53.240
..merrily
Life is but a dream

23:53.400 --> 23:56.880
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream

23:57.040 --> 24:00.080
OK. If you call that singing.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.840
Urgo.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.280
I couldn't help myself!

24:16.360 --> 24:17.320
No!

24:17.600 --> 24:21.160
- I was so sure it would work.
- Oh, it did. Don't feel bad.

24:21.320 --> 24:25.640
It did work for a while. Everything went
away. It was very sad. Very, very sad.

24:25.800 --> 24:29.800
And then all of a sudden I was back
in your brains where I belong.

24:29.960 --> 24:32.800
The system must have
some sort of reset. I'm sorry.

24:32.960 --> 24:38.120
I'm sorry too, because as long as that
device is capable of influencing you,...

24:38.280 --> 24:41.920
- ..you're relieved of active duty.
- General, is that necessary?

24:42.080 --> 24:45.200
Whether you admit it or not,
you've been compromised.

24:45.360 --> 24:49.160
The fact is, an alien entity
has control over you - however limited.

24:49.720 --> 24:53.960
- We don't know what it's capable of.
- He can't make us do anything, sir.

24:54.200 --> 24:58.200
Then why did I treat your arm for a burn?
Didn't you say Urgo was responsible?

24:58.360 --> 25:00.120
- I didn't mean to.
- He didn't mean to.

25:00.280 --> 25:02.360
It was not his intention.

25:04.880 --> 25:07.600
I trust I've made my point.

25:07.760 --> 25:10.360
Come on, Urgo. Be a mensch.
How do we get rid of ya?

25:10.560 --> 25:13.840
I have no idea. I really... I just don't know.

25:15.040 --> 25:18.920
- He really may not know, sir.
- How could he not know?

25:19.520 --> 25:21.440
- He's just the program.
- Program?

25:21.600 --> 25:24.640
Your software doesn't know
how your computer works.

25:24.800 --> 25:28.640
Hey! My software doesn't make me sing
"Row, Row, Row Your Boat".

25:28.880 --> 25:31.680
Don't fight. I'm here.
What's the difference how?

25:31.880 --> 25:34.600
I'm not gonna make another noise.
Not a peep. Nothing.

25:34.760 --> 25:39.440
I'm gonna be quiet, like a little
tiny mouse - not a peep. Watch.

25:40.640 --> 25:45.240
I got an idea! Why don't we play a game -
some sort of a wonderful game?

25:45.600 --> 25:47.800
Something with a dictionary. It's fun.

25:47.960 --> 25:54.160
You know, you get a word and...
you write what you think the word is.

25:54.480 --> 25:59.000
It's a lot of laughs - and educational.
It's really nice. I think you'll like it.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.960
Chevron seven encoded and locked.

26:18.560 --> 26:21.760
- What's that?
- Actually, it's our version of you.

26:21.920 --> 26:24.880
But not as suave and sophisticated,
n'est-ce pas?

26:25.040 --> 26:28.160
It's equipped with sensors,
video camera, microphone.

26:28.400 --> 26:32.120
- We use it to explore, like you do...
- Carter.

26:32.280 --> 26:35.560
Sorry. I don't know why
I was telling him that.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.600
Hello!

26:45.000 --> 26:48.720
Oh! How beautiful!
Can we go there?

26:49.600 --> 26:53.960
It's an illusion. Your creators do this
in order to lure people into their trap.

26:54.120 --> 26:56.960
See, I told you they were mean.
That's mean!

26:57.960 --> 27:00.440
The MALP is on-line, General.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.520
This is General Hammond of Earth.

27:03.120 --> 27:08.280
We know the images being transmitted
to us are false. We request a dialogue.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.400
Please respond.

27:10.560 --> 27:12.600
(whispers) Why is he doing that?

27:12.760 --> 27:15.120
We want to communicate
with your creators.

27:15.320 --> 27:17.440
No. Bad. No.

27:17.600 --> 27:22.080
It's our last alternative before we
resort to actually going back there.

27:22.240 --> 27:26.840
You were just thinking of Maui,
with the big beaches and the little bikinis.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.720
That's where we should go, cos it's nice
and warm there - instead of being here.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.440
(male voice) Who dares challenge Togar?

27:36.600 --> 27:38.960
(whispers) That voice. That's him!

27:41.400 --> 27:43.320
Dr Jackson?

27:48.240 --> 27:52.200
This is Dr Daniel Jackson.
We don't mean to challenge you.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.360
We've found your devices in our brains.

27:54.520 --> 27:57.440
We'd like you to remove them. Him.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.160
Him?

27:59.480 --> 28:02.840
- Urgo.
- How do you know this name?

28:03.960 --> 28:06.120
He told us.

28:06.280 --> 28:09.160
- He interacts with us.
- He's driving us crazy!

28:14.200 --> 28:16.320
That is an error.

28:16.920 --> 28:21.320
Return the subjects.
Urgo will be removed.

28:27.120 --> 28:30.800
- You heard the man.
- Sir, we could be risking our lives.

28:32.680 --> 28:37.480
OK. Let's ask the question:
do we wanna give up SG-1 ...

28:37.640 --> 28:42.080
..and walk around the rest of our lives
with him yappin' away in our heads?

28:42.240 --> 28:44.320
(whispers) Yes. Say yes.

28:44.480 --> 28:49.800
Or... do we try and find a way to get rid
of him so we can get on with our lives?

28:50.400 --> 28:54.640
- No. Say no.
- Sorry... Urgo.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.960
That's good enough. Teal'c?

28:59.120 --> 29:01.920
If we are to remain
in the service of this world,...

29:03.880 --> 29:06.320
..Urgo must be removed.

29:06.480 --> 29:08.400
Sam. Sammy.

29:09.120 --> 29:12.080
You like me.
I remind you of your Uncle lrving.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.200
Bubeleh!

29:14.360 --> 29:16.520
(pop!) Remember?

29:16.680 --> 29:18.640
Yeah, I guess you do a little.

29:20.480 --> 29:22.400
Carter.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.320
Sorry. Sorry...

29:25.480 --> 29:28.560
- I guess I say we... we go.
- Then it's settled.

29:41.760 --> 29:44.440
What do you suppose Togar
really meant by "an error"?

29:44.600 --> 29:47.800
He meant Urgo wasn't supposed
to be interacting with us.

29:47.960 --> 29:52.840
Oh, please. Please don't go.
He's gonna kill you. He really will.

29:53.040 --> 29:57.000
He's nasty.
It'll be a painful and awful death.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.840
Honest.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.280
OK. OK, fine.

30:02.920 --> 30:06.680
He's gonna kill me. You heard him!

30:06.840 --> 30:11.360
Oh, you people, for cryin' out loud!
Don't you have any feelings?

30:13.960 --> 30:17.800
- Do you?
- Carter! Why do you humour him?

30:17.960 --> 30:20.000
He's programmed for self-preservation.

30:20.160 --> 30:23.480
Sir, that voice, Togar,
said that this was an error.

30:23.640 --> 30:27.120
We're probably not even supposed
to know he's here.

30:27.280 --> 30:29.440
You aren't supposed to interact with us.

30:29.600 --> 30:33.400
Well, um... Actually, when I first, uh...

30:34.280 --> 30:37.240
..and we got to be f... Technically?

30:37.400 --> 30:38.320
No.

30:38.560 --> 30:43.000
- Can you describe how you're feeling?
- Me? Nervous. Agitated.

30:43.920 --> 30:45.560
A little hungry.

30:45.800 --> 30:48.800
- Afraid?
- Oh, sure. OK.

30:49.800 --> 30:53.040
- Of what?
- Oh, going away, like last time.

30:53.200 --> 30:56.560
Not experiencing.
Not being here with you.

30:56.760 --> 31:00.680
- Of death?
- Ooh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, sure. Big time.

31:00.840 --> 31:06.120
He's gonna kill me, and that's why...
that death thing keeps poppin' up.

31:08.360 --> 31:10.000
- Sir...
- Carter.

31:10.240 --> 31:12.880
- Wait a minute, Jack.
- Daniel.

31:13.040 --> 31:15.160
What constitutes a sentient life form?

31:15.600 --> 31:20.120
- Self-awareness. Consciousness.
- I'm me. No doubt about that.

31:20.280 --> 31:23.520
- What else?
- The ability to think independently.

31:23.680 --> 31:26.800
I'm independent.
I just, you know... Iike company.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.280
- Fear of death?
- I got that, too!

31:31.720 --> 31:34.520
You're not gonna convince me it's alive.
Look!

31:34.680 --> 31:36.600
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

31:36.800 --> 31:40.400
He's not really here.
He's here. In our heads.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.880
Many life forms
require other life forms to live.

31:43.040 --> 31:46.280
Then you are a parasite. Like the Goa'uld.

31:46.440 --> 31:48.920
(mocks Teal'c) A parasite.
Like the Goa-ooh.

31:51.320 --> 31:55.560
Or a Tok'ra. Just being parasitical by
nature doesn't make you inherently bad.

31:55.720 --> 31:58.200
- It's a machine.
- That hurts.

31:58.360 --> 32:00.680
Sir, he's artificial intelligence but...

32:00.840 --> 32:03.960
..just because somebody made him
doesn't mean he isn't alive.

32:04.200 --> 32:07.200
- Listen to her!
- So what are you saying?

32:07.920 --> 32:10.520
I'm saying that we should consider it.

32:10.680 --> 32:16.320
Maybe this error wasn't an error, but
a kind of higher technological evolution.

32:16.480 --> 32:19.040
The birth of a whole new life form.

32:19.360 --> 32:22.280
- I can't believe this, but I agree with Sam.
- What?

32:22.440 --> 32:24.800
- Well, sir, it's just...
- No! Hammond said it.

32:24.960 --> 32:27.160
We've been compromised.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.040
We explain the situation to this Togar guy.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.440
He can deal with Hugo
once he's out of our heads.

32:32.600 --> 32:35.320
- Urgo.
- Urgo.

32:44.240 --> 32:46.160
Let's go.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.920
Oh...!

32:51.360 --> 32:53.280
I'm doomed.

33:10.440 --> 33:12.760
I hate it when that happens.

33:16.160 --> 33:19.280
Ooh, this is bad! This is very bad.

33:20.920 --> 33:22.840
Very bad.

33:28.720 --> 33:32.640
Do not move,
or I will render you unconscious!

33:33.440 --> 33:36.000
If necessary.

33:36.120 --> 33:38.040
You're Togar?

33:41.480 --> 33:43.680
Yes. Togar!

33:44.760 --> 33:47.960
As handsome as he is evil.

33:57.320 --> 34:00.480
- There is no reason to fear us.
- I fear you not.

34:01.520 --> 34:03.720
(whistles)

34:09.719 --> 34:14.960
Ooh, he's a madman. He's an evil,
terrible madman. Run for your lives.

34:15.199 --> 34:19.719
- I hear you. Be silent.
- Wait. You hear him?

34:20.360 --> 34:23.320
Yes. Hear and see.

34:23.800 --> 34:26.199
Then you should be able
to see that he's afraid.

34:26.480 --> 34:29.159
Relocate. Hm?

34:31.920 --> 34:35.199
Togar, I'd like to point out
that when I called you madman,...

34:35.360 --> 34:38.280
..l meant it in the nicest possible way.

34:41.440 --> 34:42.800
Come.

34:42.960 --> 34:44.639
Come forward.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.719
Come forth.

34:50.719 --> 34:52.639
Stay.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.480
Watch.

35:15.360 --> 35:18.280
Urgo... is this.

35:21.480 --> 35:24.280
The specimen is unharmed.

35:26.800 --> 35:29.240
As you will be.

35:30.720 --> 35:34.440
- What about Urgo?
- It will be destroyed.

35:34.600 --> 35:38.320
See? Oh, what'd I tell you?
Oh, please! Don't let him do this to me.

35:38.480 --> 35:40.640
Teal'c? Help.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.120
Kree! Jump him.

35:42.280 --> 35:45.320
Give him a double Jaffa-Jaffa kick. Go on!

35:46.640 --> 35:49.680
- Your technology is very advanced.
- Yes.

35:49.840 --> 35:52.200
They're too scared to experience things...

35:52.360 --> 35:54.320
Enough!

35:54.480 --> 35:57.240
We're grateful that you will
take Urgo out of our minds.

35:57.400 --> 36:00.520
The point is,
we think Urgo may actually be alive.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.320
- He is an error.
- Maybe he is.

36:03.480 --> 36:07.360
- Another word for it might be miracle.
- That is ridiculous.

36:07.520 --> 36:10.920
Well, what you call an error
has somehow resulted in life.

36:11.080 --> 36:15.840
He's self-aware, he thinks independently,
he's afraid of his own death.

36:16.200 --> 36:19.120
By any definition, he's acting alive.

36:20.800 --> 36:25.360
All we're saying is that maybe there's
a way of doing this without... killing him.

36:26.280 --> 36:29.520
- There is not!
- OK. Had to ask.

36:29.680 --> 36:31.760
I don't understand. Why not?

36:31.920 --> 36:37.160
The unit must be in a life form.
It cannot exist on its own.

36:37.640 --> 36:39.880
There has to be some way. You created it.

36:40.040 --> 36:43.960
- You'd be killing something you gave life.
- Dad...

36:47.520 --> 36:52.480
That's a terrible idea.
I'd rather die a painful and horrible death.

36:53.760 --> 36:55.960
It was just a thought.

36:56.120 --> 37:00.040
I wanna live. I wanna experience
the universe and I wanna eat pie.

37:00.400 --> 37:04.160
- Who doesn't?
- Enough babbling. Explain.

37:05.720 --> 37:10.120
I was just thinking that maybe...
you'd wanna put Urgo in you.

37:10.280 --> 37:14.120
No! I wouldn't do that. I'd rather
be in that... with the eyes and... No!

37:14.280 --> 37:17.960
The purpose of the technology
is to observe and explore.

37:18.120 --> 37:20.200
But the technology is different now.

37:20.480 --> 37:25.200
We don't know you, but I get the distinct
feeling that Urgo is everything you're not.

37:25.360 --> 37:26.720
You can say that again.

37:26.880 --> 37:29.840
But I think that he's everything
you wish you were.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.920
Outgoing, adventuresome...

37:33.120 --> 37:34.600
Annoying.

37:34.760 --> 37:36.840
(Jackson) It would be a chance to change.

37:37.000 --> 37:41.320
To maybe... experience some of the
things that you're afraid to do yourself.

37:41.480 --> 37:43.280
No! Not afraid.

37:43.560 --> 37:47.840
Why do you not explore worlds
through the Stargate yourself?

37:56.200 --> 38:00.840
It could help me learn
how the error occurred.

38:01.840 --> 38:04.560
- Then you'll do it?
- I could try.

38:04.720 --> 38:09.880
Count me out. I don't wanna do it. He's
mean and boring and... and... and... mean.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.480
We're giving you a chance here.

38:14.520 --> 38:16.760
- Him or death!
- No, l...

38:16.920 --> 38:20.080
- Death or him.
- Oh, dear.

38:20.400 --> 38:23.040
- Well?
- I'm thinking.

38:29.280 --> 38:31.840
He's so... so... uh...

38:32.200 --> 38:33.120
- Mean?
- Yeah.

38:33.280 --> 38:34.600
- Boring?
- Mm!

38:34.760 --> 38:37.480
- So change him.
- Me change him?

38:37.640 --> 38:40.200
Ha ha ha ha ha. (sighs)

38:43.400 --> 38:46.360
OK. I'll do it.

38:46.600 --> 38:49.920
Urgo thinks it's a great idea.
I'm sure you'll enjoy his presence.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.480
See, I knew it.
I knew you liked me. I was right.

38:54.840 --> 38:56.880
Maybe... a little.

38:59.840 --> 39:02.560
- How about a hug?
- Don't push it.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.520
Urgo?

39:26.680 --> 39:30.280
- Urgo is here.
- I'm here! I'm here!

39:34.400 --> 39:38.920
Well, Togar... Thanks for your hospitality.
We appreciate it.

39:39.080 --> 39:41.200
I will return you to your planet now.

39:41.360 --> 39:45.360
Wait. Togar... How do we know
that Urgo's really alive?

39:45.520 --> 39:48.880
- I'm here! I'm here! Tell 'em!
- I will, as soon as you are quiet.

39:49.640 --> 39:51.440
(both) He's alive.

39:51.600 --> 39:56.840
Urgo says... goodbye,
and I say... thank you.

39:58.280 --> 40:00.200
Bye, Urgo.

40:01.160 --> 40:04.520
Now we've gotten to know each other
and helped each other out,...

40:04.680 --> 40:07.040
..maybe we could
share information about...

40:13.400 --> 40:16.280
Ohh, I'm gonna miss 'em!

40:16.440 --> 40:18.200
- Hey, I know. Why don't we...
- No!

40:18.360 --> 40:19.280
- Why not?
- No!

40:19.440 --> 40:20.880
- It's fun.
- No.

40:21.040 --> 40:23.960
Are you sure that
we're thinking the same thing?

40:24.640 --> 40:27.960
- Positive.
- But you don't know what you're missing!

40:28.120 --> 40:30.040
(Stargate alarm)

40:37.360 --> 40:39.680
Stand down.

40:39.840 --> 40:43.280
- Quarantine, stand by.
- Glad you're back safe, SG-1 .

40:44.600 --> 40:46.840
Was the mission successful?

40:49.240 --> 40:50.600
Uh...

40:52.120 --> 40:54.520
General, didn't we just...

40:55.560 --> 40:58.160
You've been gone over ten hours, Major.

40:59.880 --> 41:03.280
- Oh, boy.
- Report to the infirmary.

41:06.320 --> 41:08.240
Yes, sir.
