00:00.292 --> 00:02.375
Previously on The Last Man on Earth...

00:02.417 --> 00:04.293
- I'm a cannibal.
- I'm going to get Jasper.

00:04.321 --> 00:06.321
You knew where Jasper
was this whole time?

00:06.356 --> 00:08.390
- You know what you need to do.
- We have to kill him.

00:08.425 --> 00:11.259
TANDY: I took the liberty
of cutting up some straws.

00:11.295 --> 00:12.260
(GASPS) Got it!

00:12.296 --> 00:14.396
I can't do... (GASPS)

00:26.079 --> 00:27.437
So?

00:28.898 --> 00:30.378
I did it.

00:30.414 --> 00:32.180
You killed him?

00:32.215 --> 00:33.181
Oh, yeah.

00:33.216 --> 00:35.694
I don't even remember
pulling the trigger.

00:35.719 --> 00:38.420
I mean, my back was
still to him, you know?

00:38.455 --> 00:40.918
And then I heard a popping sound.

00:40.943 --> 00:44.125
Uh, the gun must have
just discharged early.

00:44.161 --> 00:45.427
Your gun discharged early?

00:45.462 --> 00:49.027
Gail, this is not the time
for a hurtful sexual joke.

00:49.052 --> 00:51.176
We're talking about a man's life here.

00:51.201 --> 00:53.649
And Carol and I have been
working through that problem.

00:53.674 --> 00:55.768
- Yeah.
- Anyway...

00:55.792 --> 00:57.543
- So you weren't even aiming at him?
- Yeah.

00:57.574 --> 00:59.407
But, I mean, it must have
ricocheted off something

00:59.443 --> 01:01.142
and hit him, 'cause
when I turned around,

01:01.211 --> 01:03.244
he was majorly dead.

01:03.280 --> 01:06.114
You know, lower body
still relatively intact.

01:06.149 --> 01:09.084
Upper body just went full
Houdini on me, though.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.119
You know, just disappeared.
Not there anymore.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.121
- (GROANING)
- Oh, you're...

01:13.190 --> 01:15.223
(CHUCKLES) You're telling me.
I mean, the whole room looks

01:15.258 --> 01:17.425
like a Thanksgiving toilet
after a turkey recall.

01:17.459 --> 01:20.584
- Just spattered. Warped.
- (GROANING)

01:20.626 --> 01:24.085
- Gross. Well, it just doesn't add up.
- Look, maybe it'll help

01:24.125 --> 01:26.043
if I take you through
an improvised recreation

01:26.083 --> 01:27.042
of the events.

01:27.061 --> 01:28.303
So, obviously, I opened

01:28.338 --> 01:31.647
with your standard vase-based
practice shot. (MIMICS GUNSHOT)

01:31.667 --> 01:32.334
(GASPING)

01:32.353 --> 01:35.108
Then, from the other
room, I heard Carol say...

01:35.133 --> 01:37.112
(NASALLY): "Is it over?"

01:37.147 --> 01:39.147
- Is it over?
- To which I replied...

01:39.182 --> 01:41.702
(DEEP VOICE): "Practice
shot. Doing it now."

01:42.248 --> 01:44.148
And then a poignant final good-bye.

01:44.512 --> 01:47.580
And then I counted off ten paces.

01:48.045 --> 01:49.257
One,

01:49.292 --> 01:51.126
two,

01:51.161 --> 01:52.427
three,

01:52.927 --> 01:55.196
four, blah, blah, blah...

01:55.232 --> 01:56.231
Yeah.

01:56.266 --> 01:57.265
Six,

01:57.300 --> 01:59.267
seven,

01:59.302 --> 02:02.237
eight, nine,

02:02.272 --> 02:03.505
ten.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.001
Gun went off. (MIMICS GUNSHOT)

02:07.946 --> 02:10.045
Thanksgiving toilet.

02:10.723 --> 02:12.691
Maybe it'll make more sense
if we go to the actual room.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.616
- Come on.
- (GASPING)

02:14.641 --> 02:16.870
- (GROANING)
- TODD: Oh, my God.

02:16.895 --> 02:19.487
No, we'll take your
word for it. Thank you.

02:20.885 --> 02:22.524
I killed him.

02:31.542 --> 02:35.334
♪ Hungry eyes ♪

02:35.372 --> 02:40.442

between you and I ♪

02:40.477 --> 02:46.181

02:46.411 --> 02:48.133
A fitting tribute.

02:48.617 --> 02:52.120
We're gathered here today
to lay rest to most of Karl.

02:52.167 --> 02:55.292
As we all know, he was
a very complex person.

02:55.358 --> 02:58.676
So we bury him in two separate caskets

02:58.701 --> 03:01.931
as a symbol of the two
starkly contrasting sides

03:01.959 --> 03:03.710
of his personality.

03:03.748 --> 03:04.946
One of those sides

03:04.971 --> 03:07.338
was solid, kinda together.

03:07.864 --> 03:10.415
The other side was just a friggin' mess,

03:10.440 --> 03:14.663
yeah, as represented by this
loose bag of human bric-a-brac

03:14.688 --> 03:16.755
that we cobbled
together off the curtains

03:16.780 --> 03:19.114
and rugs and floors and such.

03:19.149 --> 03:20.515
Karl, we send you our thoughts

03:20.550 --> 03:23.118
and prayers as you hurtle, screaming,

03:23.153 --> 03:25.630
on your terrifying journey to Hell.

03:25.655 --> 03:28.870
Heck, you're probably chewing
on Bill Cosby's gallbladder

03:28.895 --> 03:30.091
right now,

03:30.127 --> 03:33.010
washing it down with
a warm cup of diarrhea.

03:33.035 --> 03:35.073
I don't know much about cannibalism.

03:35.098 --> 03:37.098
I assume that's how it works.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.651
Back to the matter at hand.

03:38.676 --> 03:41.752
Lucifer, it's me again.

03:41.777 --> 03:43.844
Please take care of our Karl.

03:43.869 --> 03:45.339
He was a gentle killer

03:45.364 --> 03:48.499
who, uh, tried very hard
not to eat his friends.

03:49.346 --> 03:51.212
Upside-down amen.

03:51.856 --> 03:53.055
Now, is there

03:53.080 --> 03:55.283
anything that anybody'd
like to say about Karl?

03:56.116 --> 03:57.485
Um...

03:58.671 --> 04:00.060
Karl,

04:00.085 --> 04:01.322
in case you need a snack

04:01.391 --> 04:03.091
on your unholy journey,

04:03.126 --> 04:07.719
I collected some of Tandy's
dandruff and foot skin flakes.

04:07.744 --> 04:10.449
I sprinkle them over you now.

04:21.459 --> 04:23.335
Um...

04:26.296 --> 04:29.264
I'm sorry you had to die.

04:29.289 --> 04:31.456
Um, but you are a people eater,

04:31.481 --> 04:33.861
and I couldn't risk you eating my baby.

04:33.963 --> 04:35.223
Well said, Erica.

04:35.258 --> 04:37.225
That job belongs to dingoes.

04:37.260 --> 04:40.395
National tragedy, but... it's fine.

04:40.430 --> 04:42.197
Anybody else?

04:43.049 --> 04:45.433
I'd like to say a few words.

04:47.768 --> 04:50.104
I've been thinking.

04:50.381 --> 04:54.616
For the first time since the
virus took our world away,

04:55.209 --> 04:57.127
I've been really happy.

04:57.147 --> 04:59.147
Like happy to the point

04:59.182 --> 05:01.407
that I almost forgot what life was like

05:01.432 --> 05:03.218
when there were people around.

05:03.474 --> 05:05.374
But then Karl came,

05:05.399 --> 05:08.434
and he threatened to take
all of that away from me.

05:08.690 --> 05:11.192
So I just want to say,

05:11.228 --> 05:13.228
thank you, Tandy.

05:13.263 --> 05:15.363
You were right about Karl,

05:15.398 --> 05:17.298
and I was too stubborn to see it.

05:17.334 --> 05:19.334
And I just want you to know

05:19.369 --> 05:22.470
that we all owe you a debt of gratitude,

05:22.505 --> 05:26.107
and that will not soon be forgotten.

05:26.664 --> 05:28.209
- Uh, uh...
- Oh,

05:28.256 --> 05:30.155
and, you know, I just also want to say

05:30.180 --> 05:31.862
that it's really refreshing

05:31.887 --> 05:33.920
to see you listen to me

05:33.945 --> 05:37.085
and not have to just jump
right in and toot your own horn

05:37.120 --> 05:40.355
or do that dumb little
nose laugh thing you do.

05:40.390 --> 05:41.422
(BREATHY CHUCKLE)

05:41.458 --> 05:43.391
I don't do that.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.824
Oh, you do. Y'all just do your Tandy.

05:45.849 --> 05:49.063
(BREATHY CHUCKLING)

05:49.099 --> 05:50.398
(CHUCKLES) What?

05:50.433 --> 05:52.300
You've really changed.

05:53.026 --> 05:55.336
So, keep it up.

05:55.372 --> 05:57.305
(STAMMERS)

05:57.374 --> 06:00.174
I don't know what to say. I, uh...

06:00.561 --> 06:03.629
Let's see what else I have here. Uh...

06:08.184 --> 06:09.384
Wouldn't you know it,

06:09.419 --> 06:12.290
on every single card, it just says,

06:12.315 --> 06:14.987
"Hey, you guys are the heroes.

06:15.012 --> 06:16.845
"I'm just a mirror

06:16.870 --> 06:18.459
reflecting your heroism."

06:19.360 --> 06:21.874
That's what they all
say. You can read it.

06:21.899 --> 06:26.267
♪ Amazing grace ♪

06:26.303 --> 06:30.811
♪ How sweet the sound ♪

06:30.836 --> 06:35.151
♪ That saved a wretch ♪

06:35.176 --> 06:38.778
♪ Like him and him. ♪

06:40.501 --> 06:41.793
(LAUGHING)

06:41.834 --> 06:42.543
Oooh.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.785
Oh my God!

06:43.810 --> 06:45.463
Oh, Carol. I mean,

06:45.501 --> 06:47.419
you saw it. She was,
like, gushing with praise.

06:47.457 --> 06:50.624
- Oh, she absolutely was.
- And I was just frozen.

06:50.693 --> 06:52.753
I couldn't believe it. I was like...

06:54.253 --> 06:55.496
I mean, you saw it.

06:55.565 --> 06:57.423
I did. I was taken aback.

06:57.448 --> 06:59.082
I was taken several backs.

06:59.107 --> 07:02.041
- I was like this...
- I saw you.

07:02.066 --> 07:04.338
But I couldn't move. It was like...

07:04.828 --> 07:05.960
And I was like...

07:07.222 --> 07:08.709
(HIGH-PITCHED): I can't do it.

07:08.778 --> 07:10.711
(HIGH-PITCHED): I can't move.

07:10.780 --> 07:12.680
(BOTH LAUGH)

07:14.180 --> 07:15.516
- (EXHALES)
- Tandy,

07:15.541 --> 07:18.429
this is a huge breakthrough.

07:18.454 --> 07:20.800
(SCOFFS) I don't know
about that, Care Bear.

07:20.825 --> 07:22.374
I-I mean, obviously,

07:22.399 --> 07:24.079
the rest of the group
really admires me, but...

07:24.104 --> 07:25.626
Understatement of the century.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.361
But for Gail...

07:27.396 --> 07:30.929
you know, I think it's still
just, like, a very deep respect.

07:30.954 --> 07:32.533
But, hey, I mean, that's not nothing.

07:32.568 --> 07:35.669
Maybe it could be <i>
not</i> not nothing.

07:35.738 --> 07:37.605
You mean... something?

07:37.947 --> 07:39.614
You keep this up,

07:39.639 --> 07:42.137
Gail's gonna go from
being your mother-in-law

07:42.162 --> 07:44.295
to a mother-in-awe.

07:44.320 --> 07:45.613
And that would be great,

07:46.009 --> 07:48.411
but that's not what
this is about, Carol.

07:48.436 --> 07:51.393
This is about me being
the best Tandy I can be

07:51.418 --> 07:54.488
for no other reason than
it just feels really good.

07:54.557 --> 07:55.556
Aw.

07:55.591 --> 07:57.391
Carol, what's happening to me?

07:57.460 --> 07:58.814
You killed a man.

07:58.839 --> 08:00.127
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

08:00.152 --> 08:03.297
I should murder people more often.

08:03.899 --> 08:05.332
And there we go.

08:05.829 --> 08:07.071
Come on, Todd.

08:07.096 --> 08:08.195
Just 'cause we're in a little fight

08:08.220 --> 08:09.470
doesn't mean you need to sleep out here.

08:09.539 --> 08:12.105
Oh, this isn't for me. This is for you.

08:12.130 --> 08:13.963
It's the liar's couch.

08:15.134 --> 08:16.310
That's a chair.

08:16.379 --> 08:17.411
Congratulations.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.522
Now you know what it
feels like to be lied to.

08:19.683 --> 08:21.583
Fine, Todd.

08:21.608 --> 08:23.751
I am sorry I didn't
tell you about Jasper.

08:23.819 --> 08:25.419
Oh, she's sorry.

08:25.521 --> 08:26.754
I made a promise to him.

08:26.822 --> 08:29.557
Y-You knew I was out there
looking for him, worried sick.

08:29.625 --> 08:31.492
I mean, when were you
planning on letting me know?

08:31.594 --> 08:33.753
Do you think I wanted
to be in this position?

08:33.894 --> 08:35.395
Lying to everyone?

08:35.431 --> 08:36.222
I don't know.

08:36.246 --> 08:37.565
All I was trying to do was to make sure

08:37.633 --> 08:39.600
that nine-to-11-year-old
little boy had a lifeline

08:39.669 --> 08:41.534
so that we didn't lose him altogether.

08:43.539 --> 08:45.212
I made a promise.

08:45.923 --> 08:47.474
I know, and I'm-I'm...

08:47.894 --> 08:49.160
Geez, I'm sorry.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.579
- (SIGHS)
- Really, I'm-I'm sorry.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.940
I'm sorry, too.

08:55.751 --> 08:58.519
Well, I'm glad we settled that. (LAUGHS)

08:59.157 --> 09:00.598
So, where is he?

09:01.069 --> 09:02.135
- Todd.
- What?

09:02.160 --> 09:03.759
You know I can't tell you that.

09:03.784 --> 09:04.583
Why?

09:04.720 --> 09:06.594
We just went over this!

09:06.662 --> 09:08.395
Well, then I bid you good night!

09:08.497 --> 09:10.397
Okay? Sweet nightmares!

09:10.499 --> 09:13.334
Enjoy your chair bed!

09:13.620 --> 09:15.620
Ridiculous.

09:17.093 --> 09:18.926
(SIGHS)

09:19.163 --> 09:20.341
CAROL (CHUCKLING): Wow.

09:20.409 --> 09:21.675
Oh.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.311
What's going on in here?

09:24.380 --> 09:26.046
Eh, just doing a little cleanup.

09:26.071 --> 09:27.781
You cleaned up this whole room?

09:27.850 --> 09:30.718
Well, I had a little
help from Señor Clean.

09:31.210 --> 09:33.176
Tandy Miller, what's gotten into you?

09:33.264 --> 09:35.217
It looks like the Tandy-man

09:35.250 --> 09:37.417
has become the handyman.

09:37.449 --> 09:38.325
Hey, gals.

09:38.350 --> 09:39.393
Come on, cut it out.

09:39.462 --> 09:41.362
We all would have done the same thing.

09:41.397 --> 09:43.108
- It's no big deal.
- GAIL: Wait.

09:43.133 --> 09:46.467
(SCOFFS) Did you just say "no big deal"

09:46.502 --> 09:48.369
instead of saying "NBD"

09:48.437 --> 09:50.404
or "nizzle bizzle dizzy"?

09:50.473 --> 09:52.406
(LAUGHS) Fresh pot of
coffee on the table.

09:52.475 --> 09:53.641
Help yourself.

09:58.414 --> 10:00.381
Um, Tandy,

10:01.250 --> 10:03.042
do we have any creamer?

10:03.066 --> 10:04.385
Creamer? (CHUCKLES)

10:04.417 --> 10:07.335
- No, I don't think that we do, no.
- Wait, Tandy.

10:07.456 --> 10:09.972
Come on. Really listen to me.

10:10.495 --> 10:13.460
Do we have any cream... her?

10:14.341 --> 10:15.253
Sorry, no.

10:15.278 --> 10:17.253
I can pop out to the store.

10:17.278 --> 10:19.324
ERICA: Come on, Tandy.
You know what she's saying.

10:19.349 --> 10:20.855
Gail, set me up.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.369
Erica, do we have any creamer?

10:22.438 --> 10:23.437
Creamer? I hardly knew her.

10:23.506 --> 10:25.606
Boom! Doy, duh.

10:26.238 --> 10:28.305
(LAUGHS) That's very funny.

10:28.330 --> 10:30.016
But, look, I should
probably just keep focused

10:30.041 --> 10:31.274
on the task at hand.

10:31.299 --> 10:34.167
Oh, Gail, can you pass me that
cleaner-no-further-comment?

10:38.751 --> 10:40.669
Thank you.

10:49.998 --> 10:51.622
(SLURRING): You're going
to see him, aren't you?

10:51.647 --> 10:54.501
- (EXHALES) You scared me.
- Oh.

10:54.537 --> 10:55.669
You were scared?

10:55.738 --> 10:58.411
In the... in the
comfort of your own home?

10:58.436 --> 11:01.408
I wonder how a boy
alone in the woods feels.

11:01.477 --> 11:03.343
Todd, it's 11:00 a.m.
What are you drinking?

11:03.412 --> 11:05.379
Well, I wish it was poison.

11:06.491 --> 11:09.517
But if you must know,
it's Bud Light Lime, rocks.

11:09.542 --> 11:11.538
And I'm already two deep.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.441
Ah.

11:15.584 --> 11:17.210
I'm coming with you.

11:17.244 --> 11:18.387
We talked about this.

11:18.412 --> 11:20.661
Melissa, look, this craziness
has gone on long enough.

11:20.730 --> 11:23.530
I'm coming with you. I'm
not taking no for an answer.

11:23.632 --> 11:25.666
- No.
- Fine!

11:42.250 --> 11:43.917
What are you doing?

11:43.959 --> 11:45.751
Well, uh, people have been complaining

11:45.752 --> 11:47.167
about the dirty diaper pile,

11:47.195 --> 11:49.389
so I decided to do something about it.

11:49.458 --> 11:50.591
And balloons is your answer?

11:50.659 --> 11:52.392
That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen.

11:52.417 --> 11:55.334
I don't know. It smells better already.

11:55.359 --> 11:56.648
Looks kind of fun.

11:56.673 --> 11:58.061
I'm on board.

11:58.086 --> 11:59.219
Thanks, G Spot.

11:59.244 --> 12:01.179
(LAUGHS) G Spot?

12:01.204 --> 12:02.469
Tandy Miller, do you know

12:02.538 --> 12:04.437
they used to call me
that in high school?

12:04.462 --> 12:05.372
TANDY: What?

12:05.441 --> 12:06.406
Two years ago?

12:06.475 --> 12:10.410
Now, you're gonna
make me blush. (LAUGHS)

12:10.435 --> 12:11.568
Hey, where you going

12:11.593 --> 12:12.556
with that cooler, hon?

12:12.581 --> 12:14.226
Gail, you know exactly where I'm going.

12:14.251 --> 12:16.251
So, if you want to give
me any crap, just save it.

12:16.678 --> 12:17.695
Melissa?

12:17.720 --> 12:18.753
What?

12:19.147 --> 12:20.792
Go to him.

12:26.341 --> 12:28.107
G Spot, you want to do one?

12:28.132 --> 12:30.966
- Duh.
- Well, get in here, girl.

12:48.792 --> 12:51.166
(LAUGHING)

12:51.167 --> 12:52.457
No I'm being serious.

12:52.482 --> 12:53.999
Blue raspberry's not a real flavor.

12:54.042 --> 12:56.251
The Pop-Tart people just made it up.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.374
(LAUGHS)

12:57.956 --> 12:59.454
Scored you some new comic books.

12:59.479 --> 13:00.511
Thanks.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.180
MELISSA: So, I have
to tell you something.

13:03.648 --> 13:05.031
The others found out I know.

13:05.056 --> 13:06.022
What?

13:06.047 --> 13:07.384
There was this really big emergency,

13:07.487 --> 13:09.061
and this guy was trying to eat us,

13:09.086 --> 13:11.555
and then Tandy exploded him.

13:11.586 --> 13:13.157
There was blood and guts everywhere.

13:13.259 --> 13:14.922
Really gross. You would have loved it.

13:15.584 --> 13:17.667
Anyway, I had to tell them,

13:17.691 --> 13:19.432
so they're all really mad at me.

13:20.203 --> 13:22.370
Because they just really miss you.

13:23.081 --> 13:25.046
Especially Todd.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.305
But I won't tell them.

13:28.775 --> 13:31.676
I won't tell them where you are
if you don't want me to. Okay?

13:34.836 --> 13:36.869
Just keep bringing you Pop-Tarts.

13:36.894 --> 13:38.597
(BOTH LAUGH)

13:38.622 --> 13:40.451
MELISSA: Such a healthy diet.

13:41.135 --> 13:42.734
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

13:42.759 --> 13:44.125
Come in.

13:48.807 --> 13:51.302
What are you all dressed up for?

13:51.818 --> 13:53.852
- I have a date.
- Oh, yeah?

13:54.197 --> 13:56.487
What are you getting your bad self into?

13:56.524 --> 13:58.424
I'm having a drink...

13:58.665 --> 14:00.665
with my mother-in-law.

14:01.565 --> 14:03.118
What do you say, G Spot?

14:03.143 --> 14:04.441
Well, hooty!

14:04.510 --> 14:06.343
Yeah, let's do it!

14:06.412 --> 14:08.412
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:17.751 --> 14:19.751
- What the hell, Todd?
- Look, I can explain.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.647
There he is. You want to talk
to him so bad, go talk to him.

14:22.672 --> 14:24.914
- No, I... I shouldn't.
- Then why did you come here?

14:24.939 --> 14:27.231
Look, I wanted to talk to him, okay?

14:27.851 --> 14:29.609
- (SIGHS)
- But then I saw you with him,

14:29.637 --> 14:31.570
and I realized he doesn't trust me

14:32.125 --> 14:33.834
like he trusts you.

14:34.514 --> 14:36.407
(LAUGHING): All I do is freak him out.

14:37.014 --> 14:39.048
And you...

14:39.935 --> 14:41.703
you're really good with him.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.283
(SIGHS)

14:46.665 --> 14:48.865
- What?
- It's just funny, you know.

14:49.341 --> 14:51.424
I want to be a dad so bad,

14:51.449 --> 14:53.352
but I just keep chunking it.

14:53.834 --> 14:56.626
You... you hate the idea of
being a mom, but you're...

14:56.667 --> 14:57.959
- Todd.
- I'm just saying.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.263
- Well, don't.
- All right.

15:00.677 --> 15:03.067
Look, don't worry. I've
given up on being a dad.

15:03.183 --> 15:04.142
You have?

15:04.167 --> 15:06.292
Yeah, it's just not
in the cards, you know.

15:06.293 --> 15:08.918
I can still be an uncle.

15:08.941 --> 15:10.741
You know, uncle's not bad.

15:10.766 --> 15:12.032
There are some perks.

15:12.057 --> 15:14.963
You know? All the good stuff,
none of the responsibilities.

15:16.046 --> 15:18.137
And that's enough for you?

15:18.162 --> 15:21.029
I guess it's gonna have to be.

15:23.375 --> 15:25.417
Come on, let's go.

15:28.327 --> 15:30.227
(GAIL LAUGHS LOUDLY)

15:30.296 --> 15:31.328
(BOTH LAUGHING)

15:31.530 --> 15:32.941
You want another shot?

15:32.966 --> 15:34.065
Hit me.

15:34.090 --> 15:35.232
(TANDY CHUCKLES)

15:35.387 --> 15:37.066
(GAIL INHALES DEEPLY)

15:37.255 --> 15:38.967
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE): Oh, boy!

15:38.992 --> 15:40.537
Yeah, that's fantastic!

15:40.606 --> 15:43.107
G Spot represent!

15:43.209 --> 15:45.140
(LAUGHING)

15:45.265 --> 15:46.477
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE):
♪ Gary, Indiana ♪

15:46.545 --> 15:51.213
♪ Gary, Indiana, Gary, Indiana! ♪

15:51.238 --> 15:54.004
(BOTH LAUGHING)

15:54.418 --> 15:55.712
(TANDY INHALES)

15:55.737 --> 15:57.670
(IN NORMAL VOICE): Hey, you know what?

15:57.717 --> 16:00.818
I'm having a really nice time with you.

16:04.273 --> 16:07.241
(CRIES, SNIFFLES)

16:07.266 --> 16:09.203
Tandy, what's wrong?

16:09.228 --> 16:11.101
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE):
That just means a lot

16:11.364 --> 16:13.203
to hear you say that.

16:13.228 --> 16:15.072
(IN NORMAL VOICE): It's
no secret. You and I have

16:15.141 --> 16:18.142
gone through some rough
patches with our relationship.

16:18.789 --> 16:21.624
But it feels like we're in a
really good place right now,

16:21.649 --> 16:23.850
and that's important to me, you know?

16:24.328 --> 16:27.184
Why do you care so much what I think?

16:27.286 --> 16:29.824
Guess I'm just not
used to getting praise.

16:29.849 --> 16:33.042
You know, growing up, my brother
always got all the attention.

16:33.067 --> 16:34.834
He was a real overachiever.

16:34.942 --> 16:37.261
My parents just ate it up.

16:37.427 --> 16:39.396
It's like I wasn't even there.

16:40.317 --> 16:42.199
So that's why, at the funeral,

16:42.268 --> 16:44.234
when you told me I did good,

16:44.303 --> 16:48.138
oh, man, it just made me feel like...

16:50.209 --> 16:53.143
Like I finally made
the fridge, you know?

16:54.835 --> 16:57.561
You've come a long way since Tucson.

16:57.586 --> 16:59.100
And you know what?

16:59.133 --> 17:01.245
I bet, if your parents were still alive,

17:01.250 --> 17:03.959
they'd be just as proud of you as I am.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.140
Your friendship means a lot to me.

17:06.209 --> 17:07.950
Oh, come on.

17:07.974 --> 17:10.262
Who are we kidding? Friends?

17:10.288 --> 17:12.421
Oh, after all we've been through,

17:12.498 --> 17:15.176
we're way more than just friends.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.085
You get me?

17:19.876 --> 17:22.292
Uh, yeah. Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:22.314 --> 17:23.818
Um, you know, I...

17:23.843 --> 17:27.711
I, uh... I should, uh, probably
get back to my wife Carol.

17:27.736 --> 17:29.399
You don't want a little more wine?

17:29.417 --> 17:31.792
Mm, I don't think that'd
be a good idea. (LAUGHS)

17:44.417 --> 17:45.581
CAROL: I'm thoroughly positive

17:45.626 --> 17:48.084
that Bezequille's birthmark is growing,

17:48.125 --> 17:50.043
but the Pilbasians always go

17:50.078 --> 17:51.878
through a birthmark growth phase.

17:51.980 --> 17:54.630
Waxing during the baby phase,

17:54.709 --> 17:56.585
and then waning as toddlers,

17:56.635 --> 17:59.702
and then really kicking into
high gear during puberty.

17:59.771 --> 18:00.803
I see.

18:01.105 --> 18:02.238
CAROL: Oh, Tandy.

18:02.263 --> 18:05.450
I was having the most
interesting chat with Gail.

18:05.475 --> 18:06.933
And, uh, let me guess.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.444
Did it happen to include

18:08.469 --> 18:10.747
how your mother wants
to have sex with me?

18:10.792 --> 18:11.710
- Oh, Lord.
- What?

18:11.792 --> 18:13.418
I should've seen it coming, Carol.

18:13.436 --> 18:15.818
I mean, that whole put-on
at the funeral was all

18:15.834 --> 18:18.460
just a long con to get at my dong.

18:18.489 --> 18:20.188
A funeral, Gail?

18:20.213 --> 18:22.643
That's where you like
to cruise for meat, huh?

18:22.668 --> 18:24.738
Tandy, what the hell
are you talking about?

18:24.763 --> 18:27.235
I could ask you the same
question, couldn't I?

18:27.260 --> 18:29.866
To think I used to look
at you like a mother!

18:29.935 --> 18:34.070
And then you started with the
innuendo and the hand play.

18:34.636 --> 18:37.674
Tried to take us back to the
moment where we first met.

18:37.776 --> 18:38.908
When the drinks were flowing

18:39.000 --> 18:41.542
and skinny-dipping was
the topic of the day.

18:41.547 --> 18:43.813
Well, I got the skinny for you, Gail.

18:43.914 --> 18:48.022
The <i> dip</i> you once knew is married.

18:48.047 --> 18:49.719
To your daughter!

18:49.788 --> 18:52.755
And there's not gonna be
any funny business between us

18:52.824 --> 18:54.924
'cause I haven't wanted to
see you naked for a long time,

18:55.026 --> 18:56.593
and dreams don't count, okay?

18:56.695 --> 18:58.828
You can't control those,
and I will not be held

18:58.863 --> 19:01.864
(STAMMERING): responsible
for... them, okay?

19:03.802 --> 19:05.768
And to think...

19:05.837 --> 19:07.804
I called you G Spot

19:08.380 --> 19:12.675
when all along, I was
staring right at a b-hole.

19:13.059 --> 19:15.738
You're such an idiot.

19:16.067 --> 19:18.808
(SIGHS) You two have fun.

19:19.253 --> 19:21.884
Well, uh, i-if that's
a threesome proposition,

19:21.953 --> 19:25.050
I will never accept
without Carol's blessing!

19:25.347 --> 19:27.824
And I'm against you doing
a twosome with each other,

19:27.892 --> 19:29.592
just to be clear!

19:30.250 --> 19:31.542
(SIGHS)

19:31.553 --> 19:34.656
Sounds to me like you
misunderstood something.

19:34.681 --> 19:36.561
She'll get over it, Carol.

19:38.069 --> 19:40.103
They always do.

19:51.750 --> 19:54.617
Okay, so I've been
doing a lot of thinking,

19:54.920 --> 19:56.987
and I've come to a decision.

19:58.717 --> 19:59.889
(SIGHS)

20:00.357 --> 20:02.357
I want you to have a baby.

20:04.529 --> 20:05.662
What?

20:05.959 --> 20:08.059
You are always gonna want to have kids,

20:08.084 --> 20:09.832
and I never will, so,

20:09.892 --> 20:13.770
if we're gonna get past this,
I'm going to have to compromise.

20:14.454 --> 20:16.642
(LAUGHING): I-I don't know what to say!

20:16.673 --> 20:17.907
Well, it's a big decision,

20:17.976 --> 20:19.976
so there's a lot of
stuff for us to discuss.

20:20.045 --> 20:22.373
(LAUGHING): What's to
discuss, hon? Let's do this!

20:22.398 --> 20:25.201
Whoa, whoa, easy there.
I'm not having a baby.

20:25.226 --> 20:26.882
- You... you just said that...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

20:26.907 --> 20:28.828
This is your deal, okay?

20:28.853 --> 20:31.788
I'm just gonna be the wife
of a guy who has a kid.

20:31.823 --> 20:34.791
I mean, like you said earlier,
I don't want to be the mom.
