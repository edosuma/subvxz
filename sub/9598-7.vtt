00:07.500 --> 00:10.634
Glory be to the Father...

00:10.636 --> 00:12.236
- to the Son...
<i>- Where is it?</i>

00:12.238 --> 00:14.638
...to the Holy Spirit.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.241
As it was in the beginning,
is now, and ever shall be,

00:17.243 --> 00:18.742
so help me god.

00:25.284 --> 00:26.417
<i>Where is it?!</i>

00:32.391 --> 00:33.524
Holy spirit...

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074

00:44.536 --> 00:46.270
<i>Oh, for the love of Christ.</i>

00:54.312 --> 00:57.348
<i>Damn!</i>

01:04.824 --> 01:09.426
Yum. Tastes just like
a ham-and-cheese omelet.

01:09.428 --> 01:13.330
Except without the ham
and the cheese and the omelet.

01:14.632 --> 01:17.301
How did... what?

01:17.303 --> 01:22.839
No. I am not playing "what not to wear"
at 8:30 in the morning.

01:22.841 --> 01:25.909
Wh...
it's just pants and a shirt!

01:25.911 --> 01:27.944
Well, it's just...
You're meeting Jack today,

01:27.946 --> 01:31.214
And I want you to look as good
for him as you do for me.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.884
Which is really good, by the way.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.852
So you want me to wear
my Alexander Wang dress?

01:35.854 --> 01:38.088
- You have an Alexander Wang dress?
- No.

01:38.090 --> 01:41.858
Besides, I'd worry less
about what I'm wearing

01:41.860 --> 01:43.760
and worry about yourself.

01:43.762 --> 01:46.263
- Well, what are you talking about?
- Your earrings.

01:46.265 --> 01:48.732
- They're Chanel.
- One of them is.

01:48.734 --> 01:51.234
What?

01:51.236 --> 01:55.005
- Wha...
- Mm-hmm.

01:55.007 --> 01:57.974
Oh, god, what else am I missing?

01:57.976 --> 01:59.509
Hopefully it's not something

01:59.511 --> 02:02.479
that rhymes with the word "manties."

02:02.481 --> 02:07.651
What? Where's your
usual confident demeanor?

02:07.653 --> 02:09.752
Oh, I don't know. I just...

02:09.755 --> 02:12.489
You know, I just...
I think that Jack is great.

02:12.491 --> 02:15.292
And I just really want to make
a good first impression.

02:15.294 --> 02:16.993
Which is silly,
because he's already met me,

02:16.995 --> 02:18.829
so this is like a third
or fourth impression,

02:18.831 --> 02:21.765
- and the science is unequivocal on whether...
- Okay.

02:21.767 --> 02:25.001
In this early and awkward stage,

02:25.003 --> 02:27.671
let's not concentrate
on what we're wearing.

02:27.673 --> 02:32.476
Let's concentrate on remaining
calm and not scaring him off.

02:32.478 --> 02:36.680
- Right.
- So, no talking about work.

02:36.682 --> 02:39.015
Why? The body is
endlessly fascinating.

02:39.017 --> 02:40.350
Yes, it is.

02:40.352 --> 02:43.589
- But less so the insides.
- Fine.

02:43.662 --> 02:47.591
Then what do I talk about when
something work-related comes up?

02:47.593 --> 02:50.727
- Anything.
- Oh, you say anything, but...

02:50.729 --> 02:52.829
Okay, okay.
Talk about puppies.

02:52.831 --> 02:54.698
Puppies?

02:54.700 --> 02:57.300
- Yeah, everybody loves puppies.
- True.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.368
Inflammation on the
intestinal track of puppies...

02:59.370 --> 03:01.603
The outsides, Maura.

03:01.605 --> 03:04.405
Everybody loves
"the outsides" of puppies.

03:07.543 --> 03:08.843
Keys.

03:39.809 --> 03:43.011
See what happens when you get
rid of the Dewey decimal system?

03:43.013 --> 03:46.614
I'm fairly certain this isn't
the work of some killer librarian.

03:46.616 --> 03:49.884
Victim is Brendan McHale...
dealt in rare books.

03:49.886 --> 03:51.352
Ooh, how rare?

03:51.354 --> 03:52.587
Some of the ones used
as throw pillows,

03:52.589 --> 03:54.109
they're worth
several thousand dollars.

03:56.526 --> 03:59.627
Ooh. Somebody went big papi
on this safe over here.

03:59.629 --> 04:01.429
<i>Killer was looking for something.</i>

04:01.431 --> 04:04.098
Well, I doubt whatever's in there's worth
dying over, but I guess we'll find out.

04:04.100 --> 04:07.502
- BPD's still got a safe guy, right?
- Tobin. He'll be here tomorrow.

04:07.504 --> 04:09.771
That's not exactly the urgency
I was hoping for.

04:09.773 --> 04:11.372
Oh, he's at a conference
in Las Vegas.

04:11.374 --> 04:13.341
Why does everybody get
to go conferences except us?

04:13.343 --> 04:14.976
What would we talk
about at a conference?

04:14.978 --> 04:16.944
Baseball and how screwed up
senior management is.

04:16.946 --> 04:18.946
<i>You want to travel across
the country for that?</i>

04:18.947 --> 04:20.682
- If there was an open bar.
- Ah.

04:20.684 --> 04:22.517
Jane, Korsak.

04:22.519 --> 04:25.620
The bruising indicates that each
finger was broken separately,

04:25.622 --> 04:27.822
in about five-minute intervals.

04:27.824 --> 04:31.092
Frozen peas. Doubt he was
making a side dish.

04:31.094 --> 04:32.760
The moisture on the epidermis
of the fully-broken right hand

04:32.762 --> 04:35.363
is significantly higher than the left.

04:35.365 --> 04:37.365
So the killer was using
the frozen peas as an ice pack

04:37.367 --> 04:38.900
to keep him awake
while they tortured him.

04:38.902 --> 04:40.802
Good times.

04:40.804 --> 04:42.970
The vic's only employee
is wondering if he can leave.

04:42.972 --> 04:45.907
You want to talk to him?

04:47.609 --> 04:50.011
This is Ricky Kelly.
He works here at the book store.

04:50.013 --> 04:52.947
He called us when
he found Brendan this morning.

04:52.949 --> 04:54.782
- Who did that to him?
- We don't know yet.

04:54.784 --> 04:56.651
- You have any ideas?
- No.

04:56.653 --> 04:58.152
How long have you worked here?

04:58.154 --> 05:00.088
- Little over three years.
- Do you know if Mr. McHale

05:00.090 --> 05:01.689
was having any problems
with anybody?

05:01.691 --> 05:05.126
No. Brendan made it a point
to get along with everyone.

05:05.128 --> 05:06.994
How did you end up working here?
No offense, Ricky.

05:06.996 --> 05:09.063
But you hardly seem
like the rare-books type.

05:09.065 --> 05:11.699
Don't judge a book by its cover.

05:11.701 --> 05:15.970
- I think that's the saying, right, detective?
- Yes, but I'd still like an answer.

05:15.972 --> 05:19.474
I needed a job, he gave me one.
Simple as that.

05:19.476 --> 05:21.576
In our experience,
things are rarely that simple.

05:22.945 --> 05:24.645
You know what he kept
in the safe?

05:24.647 --> 05:26.180
Nope.

05:26.182 --> 05:28.549
- You know the combination or where he keeps it?
- Nope.

05:28.551 --> 05:30.685
- Do you have an alibi for last night?
- Nope.

05:36.725 --> 05:38.993
Look into this kid's background.

05:38.995 --> 05:41.229
He didn't seem too
shaken up over his boss's death.

05:41.231 --> 05:43.448
Which means he's
either guilty, or he's a

05:43.449 --> 05:45.666
20-year-old street kid,
keeps his emotions to himself.

05:45.668 --> 05:46.968
I think we should probably
figure out which it is.

05:46.970 --> 05:48.770
Can you write your
contact information down

05:48.772 --> 05:50.738
just in case we have
any more questions later?

05:52.141 --> 05:53.908
Please?

06:00.082 --> 06:02.483
He died of shock
due to an inadequate substrate

06:02.485 --> 06:06.487
- for aerobic cellular respiration.
- He stopped breathing.

06:06.489 --> 06:08.956
And his blood pressure
also plummeted.

06:08.958 --> 06:11.826
His heartbeat skyrocketed,
his organs compensated,

06:11.828 --> 06:14.695
shut down,
and then he stopped breathing.

06:14.697 --> 06:19.718
- So, the torture caused him to die from shock.
- Yes. And it appears

06:19.719 --> 06:22.036
that the killer thought
that Brendan had passed out.

06:22.038 --> 06:26.174
He tried to revive him with a
slap, and then with amyl nitrate.

06:26.176 --> 06:28.075
But Brendan was already dead
so there isn't any in his lungs,

06:28.077 --> 06:31.279
but we did find traces of it on
the outer crest of his left nostril.

06:31.281 --> 06:33.848
Hmm, well, we didn't find
any poppers at the scene,

06:33.850 --> 06:37.251
but I can have a team search
the surrounding areas.

06:37.253 --> 06:40.588
FYI, dead bodies not being
able to inhale amyl nitrate...

06:40.590 --> 06:42.924
perfect example of what
not to talk to Jack about.

06:42.926 --> 06:45.092
Jane, I hope you don't
have dinner plans.

06:45.094 --> 06:47.728
Oh, actually, we do.
We're about to meet...

06:49.131 --> 06:50.865
But...
You were saying...?

06:50.867 --> 06:52.166
The officer guarding
the book store was attacked.

06:52.168 --> 06:53.634
Our crime scene's been broken into.

06:53.636 --> 06:55.536
- What?
- Yeah.

06:55.538 --> 06:59.207
- Great. I'm sorry.
- Jack will understand.

06:59.209 --> 07:00.641
- Can you reschedule for tomorrow?
- I will.

07:00.643 --> 07:02.877
- Okay, and remember...
- I know. Catuli.

07:02.879 --> 07:04.879
Ye... no, puppies.

07:04.881 --> 07:06.214
Yes, that's "puppies" in Latin.

07:06.216 --> 07:09.083
- Maura, I just don't want you...
- I know... screw up a relationship

07:09.085 --> 07:12.576
with the first guy I like
who doesn't want to kill me.

07:12.611 --> 07:13.880
Yes.

07:19.734 --> 07:21.134
<i>I was doing
a routine perimeter patrol.</i>

07:21.136 --> 07:24.204
Next thing I know, I wake up
staring at the ceiling.

07:24.206 --> 07:26.039
And when you came to,
that's when you made the call?

07:26.041 --> 07:27.874
Yeah, immediately.

07:27.876 --> 07:29.109
The guy, uh, must have heard me
on the phone and took off.

07:29.111 --> 07:33.146
- I tried to give chase, but...
- Woozy. Yeah, I get it.

07:33.148 --> 07:34.914
- Did you catch a glimpse of his face?
- No.

07:34.916 --> 07:37.150
But I could tell
he was a big guy... tall.

07:37.152 --> 07:40.509
For you to say tall,
he must be a giraffe.

07:40.511 --> 07:43.379
Take care of yourself, all right?

07:43.781 --> 07:46.915
What is so valuable
that someone is going to break

07:46.917 --> 07:49.752
into a guarded crime scene to get to?

07:49.754 --> 07:51.720
Tobin the safecracker's still in Vegas.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.689
I had the captain tell him
to catch a flight back tonight.

07:53.691 --> 07:55.991
We have an inventory
of everything in the book shop.

07:55.993 --> 07:57.826
Nothing of value's missing.

07:57.828 --> 08:00.963
Well, whatever all this is
about, it must still be in here.

08:00.965 --> 08:04.165
I'll be sure to get two units
to guard the place tonight.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.841
Was Jack okay with us having
to reschedule dinner?

08:12.843 --> 08:14.777
Oh, definitely.
He's very understanding.

08:14.779 --> 08:18.213
He even made us a reservation
at a wonderful French restaurant.

08:18.215 --> 08:21.784
- Do they have toast?
- French toast.

08:21.786 --> 08:23.452
Yeah, set you up for that one.

08:23.454 --> 08:24.987
It was right in my strike zone,

08:24.989 --> 08:26.989
and I knocked it through the uprights.

08:26.991 --> 08:28.590
And I've never been more proud
to call you my friend.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.058
You should have seen me last night.

08:30.060 --> 08:33.095
Not even one slipup
about a cold cadaver?

08:33.097 --> 08:35.964
Nope. But did you know
you can cross a poodle

08:35.966 --> 08:38.232
with almost any dog
to make it hypoallergenic?

08:38.235 --> 08:39.967
- They're called doodles.
- Huh.

08:39.970 --> 08:41.570
There are 50 different kinds.

08:41.572 --> 08:43.172
There's labradoodles
and goldendoodles,

08:43.174 --> 08:46.041
And, my favorite, the schnoodle.
It's a schnauzer/poodle.

08:46.043 --> 08:49.111
Huh.

08:49.113 --> 08:51.580
What happens if you cross one
with a poodle?

08:51.582 --> 08:56.718
- Do you get a poo-poo doodle?
- No, it's just a poodle.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.254
We found a popper vial in the
trash can near the book store.

08:59.256 --> 09:00.789
I sent it over to the crime lab.

09:00.791 --> 09:03.125
Great. Any word
on our wayward safecracker?

09:03.127 --> 09:05.194
He's meeting you
at the book store in two hours.

09:05.196 --> 09:07.663
Guess it takes that long
to wash the Vegas off you.

09:07.665 --> 09:09.598
Based on how he sounded
on the phone,

09:09.600 --> 09:12.267
I think you'll be lucky
if he puts in any effort at all.

09:12.269 --> 09:15.604
So, I finished
the background check on Ricky,

09:15.606 --> 09:17.873
that kid from the book store.

09:17.875 --> 09:21.243
Beat cop in mission hills
said he was a troubled kid...

09:21.245 --> 09:23.245
ran with the bad crowd.

09:23.247 --> 09:25.113
He was a regular
at the precinct up there.

09:25.115 --> 09:28.250
- He been in trouble recently?
- Oh, I'm glad you asked.

09:28.252 --> 09:32.068
Two weeks ago, Ricky Kelly tried
to sell this illustrated page

09:32.069 --> 09:33.889
- for 400 bucks.
- How did he get caught?

09:33.891 --> 09:35.591
Well, the buyer
saw the straight edge

09:35.593 --> 09:37.693
and was afraid it had been
cut out of a rare book.

09:37.695 --> 09:39.695
If Ricky was arrested,
why didn't this pop up sooner?

09:39.697 --> 09:41.230
He didn't get arrested.

09:41.232 --> 09:44.233
When Brendan was contacted,
he said the page was his,

09:44.235 --> 09:46.101
but he refused to press charges.

09:46.103 --> 09:47.970
So Brendan gave him
a second chance?

09:47.972 --> 09:51.573
Well, it's possible Ricky was just
doing the nickel-and-dime thefts

09:51.575 --> 09:54.243
while he was waiting to get
whatever was inside the safe.

09:54.245 --> 09:56.278
When he got caught,
he knew his time was up.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.997
Solid theory.
Pretty sucky outcome,

09:58.998 --> 10:02.921
- if that's what happened.
- You're telling me.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.254
<i>Everybody needs money.</i>

10:05.256 --> 10:06.955
You think I'm gonna
beat the hell out of him

10:06.957 --> 10:08.223
for a couple hundred bucks?

10:08.225 --> 10:10.726
We spoke to a cop
in your neighborhood,

10:10.728 --> 10:12.661
he said you were suspected
of a lot of things.

10:12.663 --> 10:15.197
I'll bet you didn't have good
reasons for doing those, either.

10:15.199 --> 10:18.800
I'm not proud of what I've done, but...

10:18.802 --> 10:20.769
but t-they don't add up to murder.

10:20.771 --> 10:24.740
- I would never hurt Brendan.
- All right, then explain this.

10:24.742 --> 10:27.743
I sold those, and others too,
just to pay bills in the store.

10:27.745 --> 10:29.077
Did Brendan ask you to?

10:29.079 --> 10:32.314
He didn't know.
Not until I got caught.

10:32.316 --> 10:35.751
- And then what did he say?
- He gave me a dozen more

10:35.753 --> 10:38.215
to frame and sell those,
too, if I wanted.

10:40.823 --> 10:44.092
Well, he's not dead because
he's a bad businessman.

10:44.094 --> 10:47.329
I don't know why he's dead.
Okay?

10:49.198 --> 10:50.966
Brendan changed.

10:50.968 --> 10:53.835
About six months ago, he
stopped caring about the store.

10:53.837 --> 10:58.273
He stopped answering calls.
He stopped returning e-mails.

10:58.275 --> 10:59.975
We hadn't sold books in months.

10:59.977 --> 11:04.012
I had to frame and sell these
prints just to keep the lights on.

11:04.014 --> 11:05.781
You have evidence
that you were doing that?

11:05.783 --> 11:07.783
Yeah, I got all the invoices
at my apartment...

11:07.785 --> 11:10.819
what I got,
what I spent the money on.

11:10.821 --> 11:13.288
I wouldn't hurt Brendan, ever.

11:13.290 --> 11:15.424
He came into
the Boys & Girls Club

11:15.426 --> 11:17.159
about three years ago
and asked for an intern.

11:17.161 --> 11:20.028
He gave me a job, and that
is what turned my life around.

11:20.030 --> 11:24.933
When we first talked, you said,
"I needed a job, he gave me a job.

11:24.935 --> 11:27.803
"simple as that."
Now you change your story?

11:27.805 --> 11:29.137
Yeah, well,
the first time we met,

11:29.139 --> 11:30.772
you said I didn't look
like the rare-book type,

11:30.774 --> 11:36.712
- so I guess we'll just call it even.
- Okay.

11:36.714 --> 11:38.847
What happened
to Brendan six months ago?

11:41.351 --> 11:43.185
I don't know.

11:43.187 --> 11:46.488
He stopped talking, and he
started going to church every day.

11:46.490 --> 11:49.324
I thought it was because of me,
and then it turns out

11:49.326 --> 11:51.927
it had nothing to do with me.

11:51.929 --> 11:55.097
- It was just in his own head.
- But you don't know why?

11:57.000 --> 12:01.236
I wish I did. Maybe I could
have done something to help him.

12:12.048 --> 12:14.449
I heard you got something
off the amyl nitrate bottle?

12:14.451 --> 12:15.917
Uh, no, it was clean.

12:15.919 --> 12:19.321
Oh.
So why did you call me?

12:19.323 --> 12:23.458
I had a crime tech go back
and get the trash-can lid

12:23.460 --> 12:26.294
where the bottle was found, and...

12:28.264 --> 12:32.134
- ...five solid prints.
- You're very good at your job.

12:32.136 --> 12:34.770
Well, I have a very good light,
but thank you.

12:34.772 --> 12:37.172
Do they match anyone in the AFIS?

12:37.174 --> 12:38.641
I didn't run it through the system yet.

12:38.649 --> 12:41.209
I wouldn't want to overstep my
bounds as the medical examiner.

12:41.211 --> 12:42.944
But I've got them all set up

12:42.946 --> 12:45.447
for you to do the search
through the database.

12:45.449 --> 12:49.117
You weren't really gonna
run it through the system?

12:49.119 --> 12:52.421
Oh, of course I was.
I just hadn't pressed "enter" yet.

12:52.423 --> 12:55.290
Ah.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.502
So, I heard you're dating someone?

13:08.504 --> 13:13.809
I am. It's... been a
couple of times, but...

13:13.811 --> 13:15.844
I mean, Jane hasn't
even met him yet.

13:15.846 --> 13:19.181
Well, I'm sure she'll like him.
She likes everyone.

13:20.784 --> 13:23.952
I mean, she likes everyone we like.

13:23.954 --> 13:27.055
- She's an excellent judge of character.
- Okay.

13:27.057 --> 13:29.224
Speaking of Jane, where is she?

13:29.226 --> 13:31.927
She's at the crime scene with
Korsak and the safecracker.

13:34.465 --> 13:37.232
<i>Donald Maxwell.</i>

13:37.234 --> 13:39.501
Not the type of guy you
want to bring home to mother.

13:39.503 --> 13:42.003
Not even his mother.

13:49.980 --> 13:53.482
- Is that a hickey?
- What happens in Vegas.

13:53.484 --> 13:56.118
What happens in Vegas
delayed our investigation.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.419
Yeah, I was at a conference.

13:57.507 --> 13:58.987
Is that what they call
the Strippers' Convention now?

13:58.989 --> 14:00.522
They have conventions, too?

14:05.361 --> 14:09.464
Looks like I didn't delay your
investigation at all, Geraldo.

14:09.466 --> 14:13.101
Someone was trying hard
to break into an empty safe.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.504
You know, whatever
we've been looking for,

14:15.506 --> 14:18.440
I'm not sure that it's been
in here, at least not recently.

14:18.442 --> 14:21.255
Maybe McHale knew the killer was
coming, hid it someplace else?

14:22.245 --> 14:27.249
Yeah, hid it someplace else.
Or maybe...

14:27.251 --> 14:28.517
the safe was just meant to be heavy.

14:28.519 --> 14:30.318
Korsak, does that look odd to you?

14:30.320 --> 14:33.388
<i>Yeah, like somebody's
been messing with the baseboard.</i>

14:33.390 --> 14:36.124
Hey, lover boy,
can I borrow your crowbar?

14:36.126 --> 14:39.628
It's Tobin.
You want me to do that for you?

14:39.630 --> 14:41.775
You want me to hit you
in the nuts with it?

14:50.239 --> 14:51.973
Great hiding place.

14:53.442 --> 14:55.143
Not that it did him any damn good.

14:59.048 --> 15:00.882
Father Cowens?

15:09.761 --> 15:12.795
And when we
pried the baseboard off,

15:12.797 --> 15:14.864
we found a book
with this note in it.

15:14.866 --> 15:18.968
I'll save you the trouble of reading it.
It says "thanks."

15:18.970 --> 15:20.937
So what was Brendan
asking you to do, father?

15:20.939 --> 15:22.538
If anything ever happened to him,

15:22.540 --> 15:25.475
I was to take what I'd found
to a Professor McTavish.

15:25.477 --> 15:29.245
- McTavish? He at BCU?
- No, state.

15:29.247 --> 15:31.848
- Why McTavish?
- I don't know.

15:31.850 --> 15:35.218
I was to tell the professor
that the book was a riddle.

15:35.220 --> 15:36.819
- A riddle?
- Yes.

15:36.821 --> 15:38.488
Let me get this straight,
Father Cowens...

15:38.490 --> 15:41.391
you were willing to steal evidence
to help a buddy solve a riddle?

15:41.393 --> 15:43.860
Brendan was an esteemed member
of my church.

15:43.862 --> 15:46.763
It was clear that something
was weighing heavy on his heart,

15:46.765 --> 15:48.765
and he needed my help to free himself.

15:48.767 --> 15:52.835
- I see that as my job, detective.
- Isn't that what confession's for?

15:52.837 --> 15:56.239
Well, I'm a fan of the ritual.

15:56.241 --> 15:58.274
But it doesn't always
give people what they need.

15:58.276 --> 16:01.878
So he didn't confess anything that
seems relevant to my investigation?

16:01.880 --> 16:04.479
Well, if he had, I wouldn't
discuss that with you.

16:05.349 --> 16:09.018
- But no, he did not.
- So how did you know he had troubles?

16:09.020 --> 16:14.057
For years, Brendan's been
a holiday catholic.

16:14.059 --> 16:16.859
He'd show up for Easter, Christmas.

16:16.861 --> 16:19.529
About six months ago, he started
coming to Sunday mass,

16:19.531 --> 16:21.497
<i>and then morning mass.</i>

16:21.499 --> 16:24.067
And for the last few months,
he's been the lay leader

16:24.069 --> 16:27.470
bringing up the holy sacrament
for daily mass.

16:27.472 --> 16:29.338
Didn't take
a rocket scientist to see

16:29.340 --> 16:32.341
that Brendan was trying to fill
some sort of hole in his life.

16:32.343 --> 16:34.277
And when were you
gonna go get the book?

16:34.279 --> 16:37.046
As soon as you cleared out.

16:38.982 --> 16:43.873
And my investigation would
have been stalled permanently.

16:44.888 --> 16:48.191
At least you're honest,
I'll give you that.

16:50.428 --> 16:55.598
I don't get it. It's a book.
It's old.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.201
And, yes, old things are valuable,

16:58.203 --> 17:00.970
but was Brendan McHale
so down on his luck

17:00.972 --> 17:04.473
that he's gonna let someone kill
him as opposed to turning it over?

17:04.476 --> 17:07.577
Well, Bill Gates paid $30
million for a Codex of Da Vinci's.

17:07.579 --> 17:11.214
And yet, no one is breaking
his fingers to try and get it.

17:11.215 --> 17:14.349
So my question stands.
And who is this McTavish guy

17:14.352 --> 17:16.085
the priest was
supposed to take the book to?

17:16.087 --> 17:17.420
Do you know him?

17:17.422 --> 17:19.521
Uh, he's a professor
of literature at state.

17:19.523 --> 17:22.058
I met him at a fundraiser
for the library.

17:22.060 --> 17:25.461
You know, he's a superhero in the
world of illuminated manuscripts.

17:25.463 --> 17:27.896
Okay, first of all, that's not a world.

17:27.898 --> 17:30.399
And even if it were, they would
not have superheroes.

17:30.401 --> 17:34.437
You know, he found the Gamea
Prayer book in a library in Croatia.

17:34.439 --> 17:36.873
It hadn't been seen
in three centuries.

17:36.875 --> 17:39.642
McTavish spent
15 years tracking it down.

17:39.644 --> 17:42.545
- So he's a nerd.
- Big time.

17:42.547 --> 17:44.247
Hmm.

17:44.249 --> 17:45.915
But you know what's strange
is he's an expert

17:45.917 --> 17:48.284
in illuminated manuscripts
from the middle ages,

17:48.286 --> 17:51.087
and this book looks to be
from the 19th century.

17:51.089 --> 17:55.525
Nothing is ever easy.
Okay, so, how do we proceed?

17:55.527 --> 17:59.095
Well, same as usual.
No page will be left unturned.

17:59.097 --> 18:01.564
<i>Ahh.</i>

18:01.566 --> 18:04.367
Straight through the uprights.
Very nice. Very nice.

18:04.369 --> 18:08.204
- How do I look?
- Oh! Yeah!

18:10.040 --> 18:14.977
Uh... well, that's
a very challenging palette

18:14.979 --> 18:18.347
for you, Angela, but you seem
to be pulling it off.

18:18.349 --> 18:23.019
Damn.
What can I do to look worse?

18:23.021 --> 18:25.521
Ma, you look like a Russian
nesting doll. What is up?

18:25.523 --> 18:29.478
I'm breaking up with Sean today
and I didn't want to look too

18:29.479 --> 18:33.433
good, to get him all hot and
bothered and that dump would be cruel.

18:33.435 --> 18:35.335
I-I thought that you liked
Lieutenant Cavanaugh?

18:35.337 --> 18:39.373
- I do, very much.
- But...?

18:39.375 --> 18:43.243
But I'm re-thinking my life,
and I need to let go of Sean.

18:43.245 --> 18:46.014
And I don't want to hurt him.

18:46.481 --> 18:51.084
Okay, well, Ma, I can say
with the utmost certainty,

18:51.086 --> 18:52.986
you have never looked worse.

18:53.288 --> 18:57.724
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- You're welcome.

18:57.726 --> 19:02.429
This doesn't happen often.
But right now, I'm very confused.

19:02.431 --> 19:03.997
Oh, yeah,
you'll figure out that book

19:03.999 --> 19:05.566
before you figure out my mother.

19:11.272 --> 19:13.006
<i>You didn't look hard enough, Donald.</i>

19:13.008 --> 19:15.609
We found it behind the safe
in McHale's office.

19:15.611 --> 19:19.046
Listen... I've got you
dead to rights.

19:19.048 --> 19:24.751
We have your fingerprints on a trash
can near the scene of his murder.

19:24.753 --> 19:30.424
So, I'm gonna give you a chance
to make a deal for yourself.

19:35.663 --> 19:38.432
Just tell me what makes this
book worth killing a man over?

19:47.042 --> 19:50.632
The sound of your voice is
really starting to grate on me.

19:51.613 --> 19:56.583
Look, I don't mind your silence.

19:56.585 --> 20:01.221
Whatever you go to say,
write it down.

20:31.219 --> 20:34.354
Well, I've really enjoyed
our little chat.

20:47.601 --> 20:51.404
- Oh, my god.
- Don't freak out.

20:51.406 --> 20:53.373
Why, because you've
completely disemboweled

20:53.375 --> 20:55.174
the key piece of evidence
in my murder case?

20:55.176 --> 20:56.843
I can put it back together
in 10 minutes,

20:56.845 --> 20:59.712
which is probably 5 minutes more
than it took Brendan to make it.

20:59.714 --> 21:02.515
- He made it?
- It's a Frankenstein.

21:02.517 --> 21:05.585
The... the pages,
the front and back board,

21:05.587 --> 21:07.587
the spine are all
from the 19th century,

21:07.589 --> 21:11.190
but the glue and the thread
are less than a year old.

21:11.192 --> 21:13.259
So, it's a counterfeit rare book?

21:13.261 --> 21:15.261
Well, not in a meaningful sense.

21:15.263 --> 21:18.331
A third-grader who liked rare
books would know it was a fake.

21:18.333 --> 21:20.133
You and I were
very different third-graders.

21:20.135 --> 21:23.169
- How much is it worth?
- Approximately?

21:23.171 --> 21:26.406
- Ballpark.
- Absolutely nothing.

21:27.509 --> 21:30.309
I know.
This is a setback.

21:30.311 --> 21:32.879
Should I cancel with Jack?

21:32.881 --> 21:35.581
What? No, we can't cancel
on him again.

21:35.583 --> 21:37.850
So we go, then?

21:39.921 --> 21:43.623
Or is there a third Jane-ian
option I haven't thought of?

21:43.625 --> 21:46.192
I just can't figure out
why someone is willing to die

21:46.194 --> 21:50.463
to hide a completely worthless
and fake book. I just...

21:53.501 --> 21:55.334
I'll cancel.

22:05.051 --> 22:07.185
- Hey, Ricky.
- Hi.

22:07.187 --> 22:10.989
- You needed to see me?
- Yeah. Is, uh, this an okay time?

22:10.991 --> 22:13.325
Yeah, sure. Uh, you want me
to buy you a cup of coffee?

22:13.327 --> 22:16.061
Um... actually, I got my little
sister in the car waiting.

22:16.063 --> 22:17.245
I'm taking her to a soccer game.

22:17.280 --> 22:20.432
- Oh, fun. How old is she?
- She's 14.

22:20.434 --> 22:22.267
And, thankfully, nothing like me
when I was that age, so...

22:22.269 --> 22:24.970
gets straight A's,
respects her teachers.

22:24.972 --> 22:28.173
- Nice, nice.
- Yeah, um...

22:28.175 --> 22:31.070
Anyways, I was seeing if I could,
uh, go back to the book-store

22:31.072 --> 22:33.072
you know, I know Brendan
wouldn't want it a mess,

22:33.074 --> 22:36.275
and I just want to grab a broom
and straighten it up.

22:36.277 --> 22:39.178
Okay, um... let me check
with the crime techs, okay?

22:39.180 --> 22:41.602
- See when they're finished.
- Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

22:41.637 --> 22:44.204
Sure.

22:45.186 --> 22:47.186
I don't really, uh...

22:47.188 --> 22:50.556
I don't really know what to do
with myself right now, you know?

22:50.558 --> 22:54.560
Used to have a job, and Brendan
expected things of me.

22:54.562 --> 22:57.730
Right. Well, you know,
just 'cause he's gone,

22:57.732 --> 22:59.298
it doesn't mean you can't expect
those things of yourself.

22:59.300 --> 23:05.004
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Of course I can.

23:05.006 --> 23:07.273
Do you know why this happened?

23:07.275 --> 23:09.142
Do you know why someone
would have killed him?

23:09.144 --> 23:12.545
- Not yet, no.
- Yeah, okay.

23:12.547 --> 23:15.281
But I-I'll call you
as soon as I know, okay?

23:15.283 --> 23:17.150
Yeah, thank you.

23:17.152 --> 23:20.019
And, uh, thank you for checking
on that book-store thing for me.

23:20.021 --> 23:23.289
Sure. Anytime.
So, have fun.

23:23.291 --> 23:25.291
Tell your sister I said good luck.

23:25.293 --> 23:27.793
Oh, she... she doesn't need it.
She's fierce.

23:27.795 --> 23:30.429
Okay, all right.

23:32.633 --> 23:36.269
Was there ever a moment, professor...

23:36.271 --> 23:38.871
year 11, year 12... where you thought,

23:38.873 --> 23:41.240
"the prayer book doesn't exist,
it's just a rumor"?

23:41.242 --> 23:43.476
- You looked for something for 12 years?
- 15.

23:43.478 --> 23:47.613
- Was it valuable?
- Very, from an intellectual perspective.

23:47.615 --> 23:49.215
What's that mean?

23:49.217 --> 23:52.084
Well, in classic economic terms,
the value of something

23:52.086 --> 23:54.587
is determined when two parties
come to mutually agreeable terms.

23:54.589 --> 23:57.156
But that's not possible
when the object

23:57.158 --> 23:59.859
is of incalculable
cultural importance.

23:59.861 --> 24:01.727
I'm not gonna lie to you, Dr. Isles,

24:01.729 --> 24:04.530
there were moments I had doubts
I'd never find it, but...

24:04.532 --> 24:06.332
I'm just one of those guys...

24:06.334 --> 24:08.367
I can't put down the crossword
till I've finished it.

24:08.369 --> 24:10.736
Perseverance...
secret of all triumphs.

24:10.738 --> 24:12.927
Victor Hugo.

24:13.840 --> 24:16.275
Well, from what I can tell,
your assessment's spot-on.

24:16.277 --> 24:18.277
Any reputable dealer...
excuse me...

24:18.279 --> 24:20.546
would recognize
the book as a fake.

24:20.548 --> 24:22.815
- Have you X-rayed for microdots?
- Yes.

24:22.817 --> 24:24.684
What about
a fluorescent examination,

24:24.686 --> 24:26.686
see if there was under painting
behind the illustration?

24:26.688 --> 24:28.654
Of course.
Again, nothing.

24:28.656 --> 24:33.545
So, you're thinking
it's not the book itself,

24:33.625 --> 24:36.495
- it¨s something hidden inside the book?
- Exactly.

24:36.497 --> 24:38.297
I'll take it back to the university.

24:38.299 --> 24:39.765
Won't take me long to get
to the bottom of this mystery.

24:39.767 --> 24:43.369
No can do, buckaroo.

24:43.371 --> 24:45.805
Chain of evidence, we can't let
it out of our possession.

24:45.807 --> 24:48.808
- But someone wanted me to see it.
- And now you have.

24:48.810 --> 24:51.377
Besides, however long it was
gonna take you to figure it out,

24:51.379 --> 24:54.146
I'm guessing she'd do it
in half the time.

24:54.148 --> 24:58.217
Well, very nice meeting you, Dr. Isles.

25:02.222 --> 25:03.589
Buckaroo?

25:03.591 --> 25:07.553
You have 7 1/2 years
and not a minute more.

25:15.602 --> 25:18.771
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:21.743 --> 25:25.144
Are you feeling okay, Angela?
You don't look so well.

25:25.146 --> 25:28.581
- Thanks for coming to meet me.
- Of course.

25:28.583 --> 25:32.585
You know, I think
you're a terrific person.

25:33.587 --> 25:38.491
You're warm and funny,
kind and chivalrous.

25:38.493 --> 25:42.161
And that's a rare quality today.

25:42.163 --> 25:45.164
And we have
a wonderful time together,

25:45.166 --> 25:50.874
- and we share a lot of interests.
- And I think we make sit up pretty good {*}

25:50.909 --> 25:55.587
- in the romance department, no?
- Yes. Yes, we do.

25:55.589 --> 26:01.359
- But...?
- But...

26:01.361 --> 26:05.530
unfortunately, I... I just
can't be with you anymore.

26:05.532 --> 26:08.834
- Why?
- Okay, I know this is

26:08.835 --> 26:12.270
gonna sound wacky, but I got
a fortune cookie last week,

26:12.272 --> 26:15.540
and it read "start over."

26:15.542 --> 26:21.412
- And I-I kind of knew what that meant.
- A fortune cookie?

26:21.414 --> 26:25.483
Yeah... Look, it's not about
the fortune cookie.

26:25.485 --> 26:29.721
- It's about being ready for the sign.
- And you're ready?

26:31.723 --> 26:34.325
Well, I need to take a chance.

26:34.327 --> 26:38.963
Be alone, without a man,
for once in my life.

26:38.965 --> 26:42.667
So I get to know who I am.

26:47.339 --> 26:50.475
- I understand.
- You do?

26:50.477 --> 26:55.051
Yeah. All's I ever wanted was
for you to be happy, Angela.

26:55.147 --> 26:58.404
And if something in
the cosmos told you that

26:58.405 --> 27:01.661
starting over is the first step,
then you take that step.

27:03.531 --> 27:08.588
Wow, you're even more terrific than
I thought you were, Sean Cavanaugh.

27:08.623 --> 27:13.606
- But I do have one last question.
- Okay.

27:13.608 --> 27:15.308
Where did you get that dress?

27:15.310 --> 27:18.578
- Do you like it?
- No, not at all.

27:18.580 --> 27:25.346
But that's okay, 'cause I remember
what you look like without it.

27:39.433 --> 27:41.567
That guy doesn't move.

27:41.569 --> 27:45.638
- I saw him blink 20 minutes ago.
- He's a well-trained monkey.

27:45.640 --> 27:47.974
Makes me sick.

27:47.976 --> 27:49.609
Me too, but there's nothing
we can do about it

27:49.611 --> 27:51.043
If he wants to lawyer up
and ask for bail...

27:51.045 --> 27:53.546
N-no...
No, I-I meant the bread.

27:53.548 --> 27:55.414
Just... everything
makes me queasy.

27:55.416 --> 27:56.849
Oh.

27:56.851 --> 27:59.685
Detectives?
The suspect's lawyer's here.

27:59.687 --> 28:02.488
Our cue to leave.

28:06.794 --> 28:09.428
Korsak.

28:09.430 --> 28:13.842
Well, well, well,
look what the cat drug in.

28:17.938 --> 28:21.073
Saw your lawyer today.

28:30.661 --> 28:34.531
Your lawyer represents this guy.

28:34.532 --> 28:36.466
Don't know him.

28:36.468 --> 28:39.836
Donald Maxwell.
He's involved in the murder

28:39.838 --> 28:41.838
of a book seller
named Brendan McHale.

28:41.840 --> 28:44.540
They're killing book sellers now?

28:44.542 --> 28:47.977
What's next, the ice-cream man?

28:47.979 --> 28:52.382
They broke his fingers one
by one until he died of shock.

28:52.384 --> 28:54.784
Just seems like something they
would do back in the old days.

28:57.288 --> 28:59.989
You think I'm involved?

28:59.991 --> 29:01.858
I didn't come here
'cause I missed you.

29:01.860 --> 29:05.695
Right. Well, in case you
haven't noticed, I'm in prison.

29:05.697 --> 29:09.040
In case you haven't noticed, you're
still the biggest crime boss in Boston.

29:12.369 --> 29:15.471
I had nothing to do with this.

29:16.473 --> 29:20.076
Okay, but maybe
you still know some things.

29:20.078 --> 29:23.479
The killer was looking for something.
Who sends this guy to find it?

29:27.517 --> 29:30.086
How's Maura?

29:33.992 --> 29:37.527
She's good.
Really good.

29:47.538 --> 29:51.908
Nobody sends Donald Maxwell
to do something difficult.

29:51.910 --> 29:54.143
He couldn't break wind without help.

29:54.145 --> 29:57.480
- Then why is he at my crime scene?
- I don't know.

29:57.482 --> 30:02.585
- But he's just an errand boy.
- An errand boy...

30:04.254 --> 30:07.824
So, what... maybe he's helping
out somebody around Boston,

30:07.826 --> 30:11.995
- somebody who's not from here?
- Sounds like Donald's speed.

30:14.131 --> 30:15.965
Well, if he's driving
somebody around,

30:15.967 --> 30:17.689
maybe he's got to get back to them.

30:20.370 --> 30:25.108
- Thank you.
- Jane.

30:25.110 --> 30:27.276
Yeah?

30:27.278 --> 30:30.213
Now can you do me a favor?

30:35.520 --> 30:39.155
They're releasing Maxwell
in 10 or 15 minutes.

30:39.157 --> 30:40.677
Yeah, yeah, we'll be right behind him.

30:42.360 --> 30:44.694
All right, bye, Jane.
Drive safe.

30:44.696 --> 30:47.096
Jane's gone?
W-when will she be back?

30:47.098 --> 30:48.164
Um...

30:49.600 --> 30:52.568
She's going up to Wellington.

30:54.171 --> 30:57.273
- Penitentiary?
- Yeah.

30:57.275 --> 31:03.012
- For the case.
- Yeah.

31:03.014 --> 31:08.017
- You okay?
- Yeah.

31:08.019 --> 31:13.289
- Uh, I got to go. Surveillance.
- Hmm.

31:31.942 --> 31:33.543
<i>He's stopping in front of 2264.</i>

31:33.545 --> 31:35.678
Make sure that's where
he's headed before we grab him.

31:52.429 --> 31:54.597
You let me go on bail.

31:54.599 --> 31:56.466
Yes, we did.
Aren't we nice?

31:56.468 --> 31:58.101
<i>Keep him quiet someplace else.</i>

32:05.175 --> 32:07.677
So, what do we do if he wasn't
meeting up with our killer?

32:07.679 --> 32:10.113
He's married and he lives
on the South Side?

32:10.115 --> 32:12.181
He would have rushed home
instead of rushing here.

32:12.183 --> 32:13.716
Guess he's got a girlfriend.

32:13.718 --> 32:15.618
So, it's heartfelt "I'm sorry"
and a call to his wife?

32:15.620 --> 32:18.521
Seems only right.

32:18.523 --> 32:21.390
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

32:26.197 --> 32:28.498
Hey!

32:28.500 --> 32:30.500
Police!
Don't hurt me!

32:34.071 --> 32:36.506
Sometimes it pays to be
the slowest guy in the room.

32:42.646 --> 32:45.414
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:45.416 --> 32:47.083
You're here late.

32:47.085 --> 32:49.118
Just trying to figure out
what this book is about.

32:49.120 --> 32:52.389
Right.

32:53.391 --> 32:58.661
- Anyway...
- I know you saw Paddy.

32:58.663 --> 33:01.130
Yeah, Frankie
said he ran into you.

33:01.132 --> 33:02.732
I was gonna tell you when I got back.

33:02.734 --> 33:06.072
Look, you're just doing your job.
You don't owe me an explanation.

33:06.073 --> 33:12.016
Paddy is being transferred to
a super-max prison at Atwater.

33:12.642 --> 33:16.612
- Oh.
- Atwater's in California.

33:16.614 --> 33:19.748
And why...
why are they moving him?

33:19.750 --> 33:22.484
It's just a thing they do
with high-security felons.

33:22.486 --> 33:24.653
It keeps them
from getting comfortable.

33:27.224 --> 33:31.093
He said that he would like
to see you before he leaves.

33:31.095 --> 33:34.663
Do we have anything left
to say to each other?

33:34.665 --> 33:37.266
I mean, I don't know if you have
anything to say to him,

33:37.268 --> 33:41.304
but I think he feels like he
would like to get some more

33:41.305 --> 33:45.341
things off his chest, you
know, before it's too late.

33:45.343 --> 33:48.377
But you don't have to go and listen.

33:49.913 --> 33:53.382
- Off his chest.
- Yeah.

33:53.384 --> 33:55.718
I mean, I think
he just feels, you know...

33:55.720 --> 33:58.754
Sh... Maura?

34:06.763 --> 34:10.799
- Are you okay?
- Brendan felt guilty.

34:10.801 --> 34:14.637
Yeah, he... he hired the needy
intern and was going to church.

34:14.639 --> 34:16.545
Clearly, he was working
through something.

34:16.641 --> 34:19.775
And he was willing to
die to protect this book.

34:19.777 --> 34:22.411
Because he wanted
McTavish to have it.

34:22.413 --> 34:27.416
But it wasn't McTavish's expertise
that made him so important.

34:27.418 --> 34:30.686
- It was his persistence.
- The riddle.

34:30.688 --> 34:32.487
No, you looked.
You didn't find anything.

34:32.489 --> 34:34.723
Because it's not in the book.

34:34.725 --> 34:36.625
It is the book.

34:36.627 --> 34:42.164
Brendan wasn't trying to make
a fake 19th-century book...

34:42.166 --> 34:44.733
he made a book that pointed
to the 19th century.

34:44.735 --> 34:46.869
And McTavish would have realized it...

34:46.871 --> 34:48.971
not as fast as I did, but still...

34:48.973 --> 34:52.708
that Brendan had hidden
something with a technique

34:52.710 --> 34:57.846
that was primarily used during
that time called fore-edge painting.

35:08.425 --> 35:11.560
He was involved in a bombing
that killed two people.

35:13.163 --> 35:17.669
This is his confession.

35:26.182 --> 35:30.586
- What are you doing?
- Watching her work.

35:30.588 --> 35:33.655
- Your sister?
- No, the cop she's with.

35:33.657 --> 35:35.390
She's British.
Her name's Gillian.

35:35.392 --> 35:37.359
She's got one
of those accents, you know,

35:37.361 --> 35:39.761
like James Bond and Mary Poppins
rolled into one.

35:39.763 --> 35:41.930
Oh, even insults sound good
in that accent.

35:41.932 --> 35:43.565
Yeah, I wish she'd insult me.

35:45.469 --> 35:48.170
<i>I'm such an idiot.
I took her to the break room</i>

35:48.172 --> 35:49.738
<i>and I offered her coffee instead of tea.</i>

35:49.740 --> 35:51.473
<i>Oh, the Queen would be mortified.</i>

35:51.475 --> 35:53.609
<i>Right? I got so flustered.</i>

35:53.611 --> 35:56.778
What, is she Scotland Yard or MI6?

35:56.780 --> 35:59.155
- I don't know.
- Probably not MI6,

35:59.156 --> 36:01.683
or she'd have disappeared you
over the coffee thing.

36:01.685 --> 36:04.920
Basically, she started talking
and I went into dreamland.

36:04.922 --> 36:07.789
Tell me something, Korsak,
why do the Brits

36:07.791 --> 36:10.225
sound so much smarter and
more sophisticated than we do?

36:10.227 --> 36:11.860
Don't know.
I'm like that with Hungarians.

36:11.862 --> 36:14.463
I hear those guttural sounds, I'm putty.

36:16.700 --> 36:18.834
<i>This is incredible.</i>

36:18.836 --> 36:22.804
How did you figure it out?
Are you some sort of bibliophile?

36:22.806 --> 36:24.907
No, it... it... it wasn't me.

36:24.909 --> 36:28.644
It was our resident
everything-o-phile, Dr. Maura Isles.

36:28.646 --> 36:34.191
- I don't know everything.
- What's the capital of Chile?

36:34.350 --> 36:38.287
- She knows.
- The victims were soldiers.

36:38.289 --> 36:40.455
In all these years,
we've never had a single lead

36:40.457 --> 36:42.624
as to who was responsible
for the bombing.

36:42.626 --> 36:45.694
Mr. McHale's confession ties up
all the loose ends.

36:45.696 --> 36:47.796
One thing I don't understand...

36:47.798 --> 36:49.598
why did he hide his confession
in a book?

36:49.600 --> 36:52.868
- Why didn't he just turn himself in?
- I think he was going to.

36:52.870 --> 36:56.038
We still have active wire taps
on some of the former members

36:56.040 --> 36:58.974
of Irish-liberation organizations.

36:58.976 --> 37:00.409
We've been picking up
anxious chatter

37:00.411 --> 37:02.277
about someone confessing
to the bombing.

37:02.279 --> 37:04.746
His co-conspirators might
have been getting nervous.

37:04.748 --> 37:07.482
So, the book was like
an insurance policy.

37:07.484 --> 37:10.319
If something happened to him, at
least the truth would come out.

37:10.321 --> 37:11.853
And he was right.

37:11.855 --> 37:14.723
Now, with this, the forensic
evidence you uncovered,

37:14.725 --> 37:17.059
the people you arrested,
and our wire taps,

37:17.061 --> 37:19.561
we'll be able to close this case.

37:20.797 --> 37:23.532
Thank you both for what you've done.

37:23.534 --> 37:27.493
Victims' families have waited
a long time for answers.

37:29.272 --> 37:32.975
If you ever have something
to tell me, just tell me, okay?

37:32.977 --> 37:38.380
Don't use, like, codes or
invisible ink or talking animals.

37:38.382 --> 37:41.049
A talking animal seems like
the worst way to hide a secret.

37:41.051 --> 37:43.051
Have you never seen a pirate movie?

37:44.655 --> 37:47.823
- Where are you going?
- Uh, to see Ricky.

37:47.825 --> 37:49.925
He's waiting for me
in the break room.

37:49.927 --> 37:54.196
- What are you gonna tell him?
- The truth.

37:54.197 --> 37:57.996
You mean that sometimes the
people we love do horrible things

37:58.079 --> 38:01.198
but it doesn't have anything to
do with how they feel about us?

38:01.200 --> 38:03.834
Something like that, yeah.

38:06.805 --> 38:10.941
Or I could just talk about doogles.

38:10.943 --> 38:13.912
- Doodles.
- Either way, I think I could

38:13.913 --> 38:16.780
use cross-bred puppies
as a metaphor for change.

38:16.810 --> 38:18.596
I'm not sure
if that makes any sense,

38:18.605 --> 38:21.886
either from a genealogy
perspective or an emotional one.

38:21.888 --> 38:24.288
Or it could be brilliant and
you just haven't realized it.

38:24.290 --> 38:28.591
- And it's Santiago.
- Brilliant!

38:32.248 --> 38:34.616
Okay, Ma, you sure
you're not hurting yourself?

38:34.618 --> 38:37.719
No, no. The body is meant
to be flexible, baby.

38:37.721 --> 38:39.521
Okay, I... I don't think
it's meant to be that flexible.

38:39.523 --> 38:41.623
I think you're right.

38:41.625 --> 38:44.626
All right, so, how did it go
with Lieutenant Cavanaugh?

38:44.628 --> 38:46.494
He understood.

38:46.496 --> 38:47.695
What did he say about the dress?

38:47.697 --> 38:49.564
Yeah, uh, he saw right through it.

38:50.667 --> 38:53.134
He'll be okay.

38:53.136 --> 38:54.569
What about you?
Are you okay?

38:54.571 --> 38:56.805
Yeah, I'm good.

38:56.807 --> 38:58.373
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:58.375 --> 39:01.309
I'm not in a relationship,
I quit my job,

39:01.311 --> 39:04.212
and I'll have a complete fresh start.

39:04.214 --> 39:10.752
- Ma, you quit your job?
- Everything's got to change, baby.

39:10.754 --> 39:14.155
For me, it's like I've got
to tear down the house,

39:14.157 --> 39:18.393
right down to the foundation,
so I can start again.

39:18.395 --> 39:21.429
- You got another job lined up?
- Nope.

39:21.431 --> 39:24.666
This way I'll have absolute
freedom from everything.

39:24.668 --> 39:29.913
Right, but the absolute freedom part
sounds like absolute absence of a plan.

39:29.915 --> 39:32.249
Well, that's how you figure out
what you want to do next.

39:32.251 --> 39:33.650
You're gonna have a lot
of free time on your hands.

39:33.652 --> 39:36.820
Yeah, I'm excited.
And this way, I'll be able to help you.

39:36.822 --> 39:39.489
W-what... you're gonna
still stay here at Maura's?

39:39.491 --> 39:42.993
Who knows?

39:42.995 --> 39:45.791
Wait, you know my couch
doesn't fold out, right?

39:50.836 --> 39:52.669
Uh... Hey!

39:52.671 --> 39:56.339
- Your earrings match.
- You're eating cream cheese.

39:56.341 --> 39:59.976
Uh, yes, I'm throwing
caution to the wind.

39:59.978 --> 40:03.747
Nauseous without cream cheese,
nauseous with.

40:03.749 --> 40:06.583
So I figured I'd pick the best
option that has the most flavor.

40:06.585 --> 40:09.286
Well, your mother's
not the only one making changes.

40:09.288 --> 40:12.856
Mm.
Well, my first...

40:12.858 --> 40:15.325
order of business
is that I'm ready to meet Jack.

40:15.327 --> 40:18.028
- About that...
- I've cleared my schedule.

40:18.030 --> 40:22.766
My toast will soon be eaten.
I have even researched the doodle.

40:22.768 --> 40:26.403
I'm seriously considering
adopting a St. Bernadoodle.

40:26.405 --> 40:27.704
They're very cute.

40:27.706 --> 40:31.574
Well, I... I had to cancel
with Jack again.

40:31.576 --> 40:34.876
- Aw, why?
- There's something that I need to do.

40:34.878 --> 40:37.345
Something more impotant than Jack?

40:37.347 --> 40:40.448
Yeah. And I could really use
some company.

40:40.450 --> 40:42.950
Yeah, okay.

40:56.099 --> 40:57.799
I'll be right here if you need me.
