WEBVTT

00:00.166 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.833
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.750 --> 00:28.208
we're so adventurous

00:28.208 --> 00:31.583
and again

00:31.583 --> 00:35.083
and there's nobody home

00:35.083 --> 00:38.500
to count on a friend

00:38.500 --> 00:42.083
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:44.000 --> 00:45.583
take me, please?

00:45.583 --> 00:48.958
I gotta be there

00:50.875 --> 00:55.291
Winnie the Pooh

01:09.000 --> 01:11.875
Oh, my.
The sun is already up.

01:11.875 --> 01:13.875
I have to get to work.

01:13.875 --> 01:17.708
Yoohoo!
Bunny boy!

01:17.708 --> 01:19.625
Good morning,
everyone.

01:19.625 --> 01:21.166
Yes,
it certainly is.

01:21.166 --> 01:24.000
Perfect weather for
swordfish huntin'.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.250
Wanna join us,
long ears?

01:26.250 --> 01:27.833
Swordfish?

01:27.833 --> 01:31.250
There are no swordfish
in the 100 Acre Wood.

01:31.250 --> 01:33.625
What makes you so sure?

01:33.625 --> 01:35.833
Just 'cause nobody's
ever caught one.

01:35.833 --> 01:38.708
Well, at any rate,
I am not going anywhere.

01:38.708 --> 01:40.875
You know what they say?

01:40.875 --> 01:44.583
All work and no play
makes somebody a, uh,
somethin' or other.

01:44.583 --> 01:48.875
I have too many things to do
to stand here wasting time.

01:48.875 --> 01:51.000
And we got
too much time to waste

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
to stand here
doin' things.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.958
Yep, there's swordfish
to be caught.

01:58.375 --> 02:01.166
Oh, my, my, my.
So much to do,

02:01.166 --> 02:03.500
so very much to do.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.375
What's this?

02:07.375 --> 02:08.875
No dust?

02:08.875 --> 02:10.625
Well, then, on to the--

02:10.625 --> 02:12.875
uh, mopping?

02:12.875 --> 02:15.000
Hm. No dirt.

02:18.291 --> 02:20.875
Oh, well, so much for
the housework.

02:20.875 --> 02:22.375
And now for the gardening.

02:24.958 --> 02:27.416
First, let's get rid of
the weeds.

02:30.208 --> 02:32.250
Hm. No weeds.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.500
The trees
don't need trimming.

02:38.208 --> 02:40.000
And no leaves to rake.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.833
No trimming, no weeding,
no raking.

02:43.833 --> 02:46.250
Yes, of course.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.875
I forgot about watering.

02:54.416 --> 02:56.833
Everything's done.

02:56.833 --> 02:58.583
Not a thing left to do.

02:58.583 --> 03:02.708
Why, I might as well
take a vacation.

03:02.708 --> 03:04.291
A vacation?

03:04.291 --> 03:08.875
Hm. Why, I haven't had
one of those since, uh--

03:08.875 --> 03:11.291
Well, I've never had
one of those.

03:11.291 --> 03:15.166
After all the work I've done,
I deserve a vacation.

03:15.166 --> 03:17.125
Nothing too long,
of course.

03:17.125 --> 03:19.708
Just a day
visiting my relations.

03:19.708 --> 03:22.500
Oh, I can't wait
to tell the others.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.000
They'll be so happy,

03:25.000 --> 03:27.708
they'll probably throw me
a going away party.

03:27.708 --> 03:31.000
And that would
mess up my house.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.583
And I'd have to work
to clean it up.

03:33.583 --> 03:37.583
And if I have to work,
I can't go on vacation.

03:37.583 --> 03:40.750
So I'll just have to go
without telling.

03:40.750 --> 03:42.250
Pooh!

03:42.250 --> 03:45.583
Gopher used my honey
for swordfish bait,

03:45.583 --> 03:48.583
and now I've run out.

03:48.583 --> 03:50.708
Why, what's this,
Rabbit?

03:50.708 --> 03:52.208
What? Who?
Why? Where?

03:52.208 --> 03:54.583
Oh, um--
Uh, this?

03:54.583 --> 03:57.250
I was just, uh--

03:57.250 --> 03:59.166
Oh, very well.

03:59.166 --> 04:01.416
I suppose I must tell you.

04:01.416 --> 04:03.416
You see, Pooh Bear...

04:03.416 --> 04:05.875
I'm leaving on a vacation
for a day,

04:05.875 --> 04:09.833
and I don't want anyone
going near my house or garden.

04:09.833 --> 04:13.458
I'm going away to relax.
Nothing to worry about.

04:13.458 --> 04:16.833
Everything's
been taken care of here.

04:16.833 --> 04:18.750
Is that clear,
Pooh Bear?

04:18.750 --> 04:20.583
Perfectly, Rabbit.

04:20.583 --> 04:22.291
Then I'll see you
tomorrow, Pooh.

04:24.375 --> 04:26.750
Oh, Rabbit, bother.

04:26.750 --> 04:30.083
That thing which was
perfectly clear a moment ago,

04:30.083 --> 04:32.750
is not quite so clear
anymore.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.000
Piglet:
Maybe Rabbit was right,

04:34.000 --> 04:35.958
and there aren't
any swordfish.

04:35.958 --> 04:37.583
Nonsense.

04:37.583 --> 04:40.125
We'll have
better luck today.

04:40.125 --> 04:42.833
Hello, bunny boy.

04:42.833 --> 04:46.708
Say,
there's something fish like
going on around here.

04:46.708 --> 04:50.458
It's Rabbit's house,
but there's no Rabbit in it.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.458
Now I remember.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.458
Uh, remember what?

04:54.458 --> 04:56.291
Rabbit told me
he was going away,

04:56.291 --> 04:57.500
and he was worried

04:57.500 --> 05:00.500
because everything
has to be taken care of.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.208
Oh, dear.

05:02.208 --> 05:04.375
Or something
like that.

05:04.375 --> 05:07.208
Then it's our duty
as long ears's friends

05:07.208 --> 05:09.250
to take care of
everything.

05:11.750 --> 05:14.625
Perhaps the first thing
we should do

05:14.625 --> 05:17.125
is scare away those cows.

05:17.125 --> 05:19.333
Crows, Pooh,
crows.

05:19.333 --> 05:22.500
Oh, do we have to
get rid of them, too?

05:22.500 --> 05:25.583
By dingy,
I know just the thing

05:25.583 --> 05:27.708
for a situation
like this.

05:28.833 --> 05:30.375
Yes, sirree.

05:30.375 --> 05:32.208
That oughta scare
the feathers

05:32.208 --> 05:35.625
off those corn nabbin'
whippersnappers.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.875
Shoo. Shoo.
G-g-go away, crow.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.416
Oh, dear.

05:44.416 --> 05:47.625
Gasp! We gotta
pick these tomatoes,
buddy bear.

05:47.625 --> 05:49.125
They're turnin' green.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.750
Oh, bother.

05:56.875 --> 05:59.166
- Say, Piglet,

05:59.166 --> 06:00.833
uh, where'd you go?

06:00.833 --> 06:03.875
I'm afraid it's rather hard
to scare a crow

06:03.875 --> 06:05.375
when you're
scared of crows.

06:05.375 --> 06:08.875
Hmm. Gonna have to
replant this corn.

06:08.875 --> 06:11.000
And I got
just the way to do it.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.708
This thing's menacing
to bunny boy's safety.

06:18.708 --> 06:20.708
Give me a hand,
buddy bear.

06:20.708 --> 06:22.000
You know, Tigger,

06:22.000 --> 06:24.458
I believe I may have
misremembered

06:24.458 --> 06:27.500
what I remembered about
what Rabbit told me.

06:31.416 --> 06:34.208
I'm gonna get that ground
ready for seeding,

06:34.208 --> 06:36.458
and I'm gonna do it fast.

06:36.458 --> 06:38.416
We can get to work
cleaning Rabbit's house

06:38.416 --> 06:40.458
soon as we get
the garden watered.

06:40.458 --> 06:43.000
And this'll make
the watering a lot quicker.

06:44.250 --> 06:46.083
Ready, Pooh boy?

06:46.083 --> 06:47.458
Ready, Tigger.

06:47.458 --> 06:49.250
When old long ears
gets home,

06:49.250 --> 06:51.416
he's not even gonna
"recoganize" the place.

06:51.416 --> 06:53.250
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

06:53.250 --> 06:57.083
Oh, Tigger,
shouldn't there be water
coming out of the hose?

06:57.083 --> 07:00.250
Uh, we'll have this ground
ready for planting

07:00.250 --> 07:01.625
in no time flat.

07:01.625 --> 07:04.333
Uh, perhaps there's
something stuck inside.

07:04.333 --> 07:06.000
On the count of three.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.750
Um, one.

07:08.750 --> 07:10.625
Uh, two.

07:10.625 --> 07:12.625
Close enough.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.291
Pooh: Oh, bother.

07:19.083 --> 07:21.208
Such a lot of relatives.

07:21.208 --> 07:24.708
And none of them
would let me do
a thing for myself.

07:24.708 --> 07:26.291
"Your breakfast, Rabbit."

07:26.291 --> 07:27.583
"Your bath is ready,
Rabbit."

07:27.583 --> 07:29.166
"Your bed is ready."

07:29.166 --> 07:31.333
It's a wonder I didn't
lose my mind!

07:31.333 --> 07:34.000
Why, I'll probably
need a vacation

07:34.000 --> 07:35.958
to recover from
this vacation.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.166
Piglet: Somehow,
Rabbit's home

07:39.166 --> 07:41.583
doesn't look
quite as nice
as it used to.

07:45.375 --> 07:48.375
Now I remember
what Rabbit said.

07:48.375 --> 07:51.291
He said we should
stay away from his home,

07:51.291 --> 07:53.833
because everything
has been taken care of,

07:53.833 --> 07:55.750
and he's coming back today.

07:55.750 --> 07:56.875
Oops.

07:56.875 --> 07:58.708
Oh, what should we do?

07:58.708 --> 08:01.166
Perhaps
he won't notice.

08:01.166 --> 08:03.458
Why, buddy bear,

08:03.458 --> 08:05.416
that's not just
a good idea,

08:05.416 --> 08:07.083
it's down right
perspiring.

08:07.083 --> 08:10.833
Yes. I think
I thought so, too.

08:10.833 --> 08:12.625
By dingy, that's it.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.583
We'll fix the place up

08:14.583 --> 08:17.833
so Rabbit won't notice
there's anything wrong.

08:17.833 --> 08:19.625
Just leave everything to me.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.250
There isn't anything
in this world

08:23.250 --> 08:26.583
quite so exhausting
as relaxing.

08:26.583 --> 08:27.625
Um, uh--

08:27.625 --> 08:29.250
Uh, welcome home.

08:29.250 --> 08:31.458
Glad to see ya,
bunny boy.

08:31.458 --> 08:34.375
Here, let me take
that bag for ya.

08:34.375 --> 08:35.958
Now you're comin' over
to my place

08:35.958 --> 08:37.625
for a welcome home
breakfast.

08:37.625 --> 08:39.875
But, I-- I--

08:39.875 --> 08:42.125
This'll do the trick.

08:42.125 --> 08:44.166
I really would
much rather be

08:44.166 --> 08:47.708
back at my own
beautiful home
so I can--

08:47.708 --> 08:50.500
Say, all done
with "breakyfast"?

08:50.500 --> 08:52.208
The let's get over
to Piglet's

08:52.208 --> 08:53.708
for your
welcome home lunch.

08:53.708 --> 08:55.500
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

08:55.500 --> 08:57.875
I only want to be home
in my own house,

08:57.875 --> 08:59.583
thank you very much.

08:59.583 --> 09:03.375
And hurt little Piglet's
little feelings?

09:04.708 --> 09:07.583
Well, no,
of course not,
but I--

09:09.958 --> 09:13.458
Jumpin' crawdaddies.
That's not half bad.

09:13.458 --> 09:16.958
I'm afraid I cannot eat
another bite.

09:16.958 --> 09:19.333
And I really must be
getting home.

09:19.333 --> 09:22.375
But you've still got Pooh's
welcome home smackerel to eat.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.708
More honey, Rabbit?

09:28.708 --> 09:31.583
No, please.
Not another drop!

09:31.583 --> 09:33.583
I just want to go--

09:33.583 --> 09:36.333
And see how
the woods have changed
while you were gone.

09:36.333 --> 09:39.250
"Terrifical" idea,
bunny boy.

09:39.250 --> 09:40.750
And see that leaf
over there?

09:40.750 --> 09:43.625
It used to be over there.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.458
And see those clouds?

09:45.458 --> 09:47.583
All changed since
you were here last.

09:47.583 --> 09:50.833
I was going to
change my shirt--

09:50.833 --> 09:54.250
But I changed my mind
instead.

09:54.250 --> 09:55.875
Right over there
you'll notice--

09:55.875 --> 09:56.958
Long ears.

09:58.583 --> 10:00.875
After him!

10:00.875 --> 10:03.083
Tigger:
Hold on, bunny boy!

10:03.083 --> 10:04.750
No more tours.

10:04.750 --> 10:07.583
No more
welcome home meals.

10:07.583 --> 10:11.375
Ahh. How nice it is
to be back.

10:11.375 --> 10:13.500
My beautiful garden.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.291
How I missed
working in it.

10:15.291 --> 10:18.000
- Stop!
- Wait, Rabbit!

10:18.000 --> 10:19.583
Piglet: No!

10:19.583 --> 10:21.375
What's this?

10:21.375 --> 10:22.625
My-- My garden!

10:25.833 --> 10:28.458
What?
My-- My house!

10:31.291 --> 10:33.166
Welcome home, Rabbit.

10:34.458 --> 10:36.500
What is all this?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.208
We didn't want to
ruin your, um...

10:40.208 --> 10:41.250
homecoming?

10:41.250 --> 10:44.625
At least not right away.

10:44.625 --> 10:48.583
Yeah, we wanted to
break it to ya easy like.

10:48.583 --> 10:51.000
We were trying to
take care of everything

10:51.000 --> 10:53.416
while you were away,
but...

10:53.416 --> 10:55.083
it wouldn't let us.

10:55.083 --> 10:57.500
We hope you aren't
too terribly mad at us.

10:58.583 --> 10:59.625
Mad?

10:59.625 --> 11:01.625
Why, who's mad?

11:01.625 --> 11:04.708
I believe you are,
Rabbit.

11:04.708 --> 11:05.875
I'm not mad.

11:05.875 --> 11:08.000
I'm overjoyed.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.833
Overjoyed?

11:09.833 --> 11:12.875
Why, look at all the work
there is to do.

11:12.875 --> 11:16.375
It's a most wonderful
homecoming present.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.875
I'll never have to take
a vacation again.

11:20.583 --> 11:23.708
We're ever so glad
you like it.

11:23.708 --> 11:26.458
Tigger: Say,
this turned out so well,

11:26.458 --> 11:28.333
maybe tomorrow
we oughta go over

11:28.333 --> 11:29.583
and wreck Piglet's house.

11:29.583 --> 11:31.208
Ah-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

11:31.208 --> 11:33.125
Oh, dear.

11:44.708 --> 11:47.958
These weeds
are taking over
the whole garden.

11:47.958 --> 11:50.000
Next thing you know,
these pesky pests

11:50.000 --> 11:51.083
will be talking back.

11:51.083 --> 11:52.708
Hello, Rabbit.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.291
Eeyore.
What are you doing here?

11:59.291 --> 12:02.708
I was just sittin' here
enjoying the company.

12:02.708 --> 12:05.416
You know, plants have
a lot to say

12:05.416 --> 12:07.375
if you take the time
to listen.

12:07.375 --> 12:09.458
I'm very sorry,
Eeyore,

12:09.458 --> 12:11.166
but I'm too busy
to stand around

12:11.166 --> 12:13.458
talking about
my garden talking.

12:13.458 --> 12:16.333
Gardening is
a great deal of
very hard work.

12:16.333 --> 12:19.125
Time after time,
I've tried to get

12:19.125 --> 12:21.333
this stubborn little seed
to sprout.

12:21.333 --> 12:23.083
I'm ready to give up!

12:23.083 --> 12:25.166
Why don't you let me try?

12:25.166 --> 12:27.958
Seems to me,
someone that can't grow

12:27.958 --> 12:30.833
combined with
something that won't grow

12:30.833 --> 12:33.708
is a real friendly idea.

12:33.708 --> 12:37.291
You, Eeyore,
with a garden?

12:37.291 --> 12:40.875
What a very
interesting idea.

12:46.583 --> 12:48.958
There you are,
Eeyore.

12:48.958 --> 12:50.458
Thank you, Rabbit.

12:50.458 --> 12:53.750
Uh, good luck making
that seed grow.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.875
Okay, little fella.

12:55.875 --> 12:59.208
Why don't you come on up
for a look see?

12:59.208 --> 13:01.583
- Pooh: Hello, Rabbit.
-

13:01.583 --> 13:03.833
Why, uh, Pooh.

13:03.833 --> 13:06.583
What a surprise.
What are you doing here?

13:06.583 --> 13:09.458
Say, what's
old Eeyore up to?

13:10.833 --> 13:14.458
uh, planted a garden.

13:14.458 --> 13:16.333
Ooh, what's he growing?

13:16.333 --> 13:18.000
Is it something sweet?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.458
He'll have better luck
trying to grow a new tail

13:20.458 --> 13:22.500
than that seed I gave him.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.500
Well,
if you'll excuse me,

13:24.500 --> 13:28.083
I have to get back to
my own beautiful garden.

13:32.708 --> 13:33.875
Shy, huh?

13:36.166 --> 13:37.875
I won't peek.

13:37.875 --> 13:39.750
Just let me know
when you're up,

13:39.750 --> 13:42.500
and want someone
to talk to.

13:42.500 --> 13:43.708
Poor old donkey boy.

13:43.708 --> 13:45.833
I can't stand it.

13:45.833 --> 13:48.458
He's so lonesome,
he's waiting for
a seed to sprout.

13:48.458 --> 13:51.500
Oh, he does seem
very sad.

13:51.500 --> 13:54.083
He's more than sad.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.458
He's "miserababble."

13:55.458 --> 13:58.250
Perhaps we should do
a little something

13:58.250 --> 14:01.000
to make him feel better.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.416
What a "terrifical" idea.

14:03.416 --> 14:06.375
Mm. How about
a very small somethin'

14:06.375 --> 14:08.250
to make him feel better?

14:09.416 --> 14:11.000
Oh, d-d-d-dear.

14:12.583 --> 14:14.583
There you are.

14:14.583 --> 14:17.291
All tucked in
for the night.

14:17.291 --> 14:20.875
Now, if you promise
not to tell anyone,

14:20.875 --> 14:24.750
I'll help you
get to sleep.

14:44.875 --> 14:47.958
Goodnight, little fella.

14:47.958 --> 14:50.833
See ya in the mornin'.

14:50.833 --> 14:52.000
I hope.

15:04.250 --> 15:06.083
Well, say.

15:06.083 --> 15:08.875
How about that?

15:08.875 --> 15:11.333
You've gotten big.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.750
In a very small
sorta way.

15:13.750 --> 15:16.333
You were right,
buddy bear.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.750
A little somethin'
was all he needed

15:17.750 --> 15:19.958
to cheer him up.

15:20.958 --> 15:22.625
But, Tigger,

15:22.625 --> 15:24.875
there seems to be
something--

15:24.875 --> 15:27.833
or is it someone--
missing.

15:27.833 --> 15:29.458
Don't be "ridickerous,"
Pooh.

15:29.458 --> 15:30.875
We're right here.

15:30.875 --> 15:33.583
Of course we are,
Tigger.

15:33.583 --> 15:36.125
Little flower,

15:36.125 --> 15:39.458
you and I are gonna be
great friends.

15:43.416 --> 15:44.583
Oh, dear.

15:47.708 --> 15:50.958
I hope poor Eeyore
doesn't need too much
cheering up.

15:50.958 --> 15:52.625
After all,

15:52.625 --> 15:55.000
not just anyone
can be a gardener.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.625
Oh, no.

15:56.625 --> 15:58.166
If Rabbit recognizes me,

15:58.166 --> 16:00.166
he'll ruin
Eeyore's surprise.

16:02.291 --> 16:05.125
Oh, my. No!

16:05.125 --> 16:06.750
It can't be.

16:06.750 --> 16:08.375
Hello, Rabbit.

16:08.375 --> 16:10.000
How do you like my garden?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.500
It grew!

16:11.500 --> 16:13.000
You got the seed
to grow

16:13.000 --> 16:15.125
in just one night.

16:15.125 --> 16:17.333
In all my years
as a gardener,

16:17.333 --> 16:20.583
I've never seen anything
quite like this plant.

16:20.583 --> 16:22.250
Oh have I?

16:22.250 --> 16:26.500
Just had to let him know
there was a friend up here.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.875
That means that

16:27.875 --> 16:31.833
you're a better gardener
than I am.

16:31.833 --> 16:35.416
Then there's only
one thing to be done.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.208
Rabbit, I don't think
this is a good idea.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.583
Nonsense.

16:42.583 --> 16:46.500
My garden deserves only
the very best gardener.

16:46.500 --> 16:50.000
And that's you, Eeyore.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
I suppose
I'd better start doin'

16:53.000 --> 16:55.875
what Rabbit says
Eeyores do best.

16:55.875 --> 16:59.708
I'm sure we're supposed to
meet Piglet somewhere,

16:59.708 --> 17:03.625
but I can't remember
which somewhere.

17:03.625 --> 17:06.458
Why do you suppose
we're not seeing him?

17:06.458 --> 17:08.458
Probably 'cause
we left him at
Eeyore's house.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.000
Ah-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
Then why don't we meet him
that somewhere?

17:13.875 --> 17:15.708
Whew!

17:15.708 --> 17:20.583
I never knew a garden
took so much work.

17:20.583 --> 17:24.083
But I always have
time for you, little fella.

17:25.583 --> 17:29.416
Oh, no.
Not again.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.583
Sorry, little fella.

17:31.583 --> 17:33.291
Gotta go.

17:33.291 --> 17:35.583
Gardener's work
is never done.

17:35.583 --> 17:38.083
Now, let's see.

17:38.083 --> 17:40.333
What should I do first?

17:40.333 --> 17:41.875
Water the weeds,

17:41.875 --> 17:43.875
or feed the bugs?

17:43.875 --> 17:46.875
My very small feet
are getting very muddy.

17:46.875 --> 17:49.000
Ooh, I have to tell Pooh
this isn't working out

17:49.000 --> 17:50.500
the way we thought it would.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.250
As soon as I
wash off my feet.

17:53.250 --> 17:56.083
Yoohoo!
Donkey boy.

17:58.125 --> 18:00.958
You seen any Piglets
around here, Eeyore?

18:00.958 --> 18:04.416
Uh, hello, Pooh.
Hello, Tigger.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.416
Lovely day,
more or less.

18:07.416 --> 18:09.750
Course,
it'll probably rain.

18:09.750 --> 18:13.250
Have you seen Piglet,
uh, Eeyore?

18:13.250 --> 18:14.958
Um, I mean, Rabbit?

18:14.958 --> 18:16.625
Uh-- Oh, bother.

18:16.625 --> 18:18.250
I'm not sure who I mean.

18:18.250 --> 18:20.708
Can't say as I have.

18:20.708 --> 18:23.083
Don't get a lot of
visitors, though.

18:23.083 --> 18:25.833
Hmm.
If Piglet isn't here,

18:25.833 --> 18:29.083
that can only mean
one thing.

18:29.083 --> 18:30.875
He's somewhere else.

18:30.875 --> 18:32.458
Follow me,
buddy bear.

18:32.458 --> 18:34.125
We gotta find
the little guy.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.750
What's all the fuss about?

18:36.750 --> 18:39.333
Must be important.

18:39.333 --> 18:41.625
Nobody bothered
to tell me.

18:48.291 --> 18:49.833
Uh-oh.

18:49.833 --> 18:52.000
My plant's gone.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.708
Maybe the little guy's
part tumbleweed,

18:55.708 --> 18:59.291
and tumbled himself off
into trouble somewhere.

18:59.291 --> 19:02.166
I'd better ask
a real gardener

19:02.166 --> 19:04.833
what to do
in a case like this.

19:08.125 --> 19:10.250
Piglet!

19:10.250 --> 19:11.750
Piglet!

19:11.750 --> 19:14.250
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

19:15.333 --> 19:17.333
What do you say
we split up?

19:17.333 --> 19:20.708
We're two of us lookin'.
We'll find him three times
as fast.

19:20.708 --> 19:22.166
Oh, good.

19:22.166 --> 19:23.875
We can use the help.

19:23.875 --> 19:27.583
- Pooh: Piglet!
- Tigger: Oh, Piglet!

19:27.583 --> 19:32.083
No one ever runs around
calling my name.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.375
As if it would make
any difference.

19:34.375 --> 19:36.333
Eeyore: Rabbit.

19:36.333 --> 19:38.875
Rabbit,
I need your help.

19:38.875 --> 19:42.333
But are you sure you got
the right rabbit for the job?

19:42.333 --> 19:44.500
No time to lose.

19:44.500 --> 19:47.125
Move it, bunny boy.

19:47.125 --> 19:50.833
I don't see
what you expect me to do
about your plant.

19:50.833 --> 19:53.083
Everyone knows
you're the best--

19:53.083 --> 19:54.250
Gardener?

19:54.250 --> 19:56.750
Eeyore.
What have you done?

19:56.750 --> 19:59.458
Why, it's no wonder
your plants run away.

19:59.458 --> 20:01.708
See what you mean.

20:01.708 --> 20:04.500
Can't have plants
runnin' off.

20:04.500 --> 20:07.958
Sets a bad example
for the other crops.

20:07.958 --> 20:11.583
Hmph.
The only thing to do
is to find it.

20:11.583 --> 20:14.458
Very small feet
dislike being
even a little muddy.

20:14.458 --> 20:16.250
Now, I wonder
where Pooh is.

20:16.250 --> 20:19.291
Pooh: Piglet.
Piglet!

20:19.291 --> 20:21.250
Pooh! Oh, Pooh!

20:21.250 --> 20:24.583
Eeyore: Where are ya,
little fella?

20:24.583 --> 20:26.875
Oh, d-d-d-dear.
It's Eeyore.

20:26.875 --> 20:28.291
Tigger: Piglet!

20:28.291 --> 20:29.958
Here, Piglet.

20:29.958 --> 20:31.250
Oh, Tigger.

20:31.250 --> 20:35.208
Plant!
Where are you?

20:35.208 --> 20:37.416
This costume has caused
nothing but trouble.

20:37.416 --> 20:39.416
Pooh: Piglet!

20:39.416 --> 20:40.583
Oh, Pooh!

20:40.583 --> 20:44.291
Little fella,
are you there?

20:44.291 --> 20:47.125
Wasted away to nothin'.

20:47.125 --> 20:51.583
Suppose it's my own fault
for not watering you enough.

20:51.583 --> 20:54.000
Eeyore,
did you find your plant?

20:54.000 --> 20:56.291
Serves me right
for thinkin'

20:56.291 --> 20:58.625
I could have
a garden of my own.

21:00.625 --> 21:03.083
Cloth? Buttons?

21:03.083 --> 21:05.708
Oh, poor Piglet.

21:05.708 --> 21:08.500
- Pooh. Tigger.
- Piglet.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.291
We found you.

21:10.291 --> 21:13.083
Oh, it's been
a very long day

21:13.083 --> 21:15.750
for such a very
small animal.

21:15.750 --> 21:18.000
- It has?
- Rabbit:

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
And I can't wait
to hear all about it.

21:23.333 --> 21:26.000
We only wanted to
cheer Eeyore up, Rabbit.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.750
Well, there's nothing to do
but tell Eeyore the truth,

21:28.750 --> 21:31.625
and apologize for that
worthless seed I gave him.

21:33.500 --> 21:37.875
I don't think
you're going to have to
apologize to Eeyore.

21:37.875 --> 21:39.375
Why ever not?

21:39.375 --> 21:42.375
Because that
worthless seed
you gave him

21:42.375 --> 21:44.958
was not so worthless.

21:44.958 --> 21:47.375
Oh, all right,
little fella.

21:47.375 --> 21:49.416
If you insist,

21:49.416 --> 21:53.166
I'll do it
one more time.

21:53.166 --> 21:54.458
Ahem.
