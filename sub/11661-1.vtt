(mellow music playing)

00:55.967 --> 00:57.266
Thanks.

01:02.834 --> 01:03.834
Oh, girls,

01:03.900 --> 01:06.934
let me tell you this
wonderful idea I had.

01:07.033 --> 01:10.667
When I was little,
my mama told me my destiny.

01:10.734 --> 01:16.467
She said, "Peacock,"
that was my nickname, Peacock--

01:16.533 --> 01:19.066
"You are destined for great things."

01:19.133 --> 01:20.467
Why Peacock?

01:21.667 --> 01:23.934
Because I was so beautiful.

01:26.133 --> 01:29.233
-Anyway, she said--
-I don't find peacocks beautiful.

01:29.300 --> 01:33.133
They've got skinny necks,
and they shriek.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.767
It doesn't matter, Rose.

01:34.834 --> 01:37.100
And they attack chickens.

01:37.166 --> 01:38.834
I don't care about chickens.

01:38.900 --> 01:42.133
She called me Peacock, not Chicken.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.900
You look more like a chicken
when you're angry.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.834
Your neck sticks out.

01:48.266 --> 01:51.800
Rose, it doesn't matter.
I was beautiful. That was the point.

01:51.867 --> 01:53.567
I was breathtaking,

01:53.633 --> 01:56.834
even more breathtaking
than I am today.

01:56.900 --> 01:59.667
But, my beauty wasn't everything,
my mama said.

01:59.734 --> 02:03.533
My destiny was to be more
than every man's passion.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.734
She said my destiny
was to be great.

02:06.800 --> 02:10.734
She lied to you so
you'd finish high school.

02:10.800 --> 02:14.133
Now I know what my destiny is, Rose.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.900
I'm going to be a novelist.

02:15.967 --> 02:20.133
A great romance novelist.
That is my destiny.

02:21.033 --> 02:23.667
I shall become
a great southern writer,

02:23.734 --> 02:27.533
carrying on the tradition
of southern writers like...

02:32.800 --> 02:36.233
all those that are so famous
they need not be mentioned.

02:36.300 --> 02:38.400
Girls, it's going to be so exciting.

02:38.467 --> 02:40.400
I'm going to make a fortune.

02:40.467 --> 02:42.600
I won't have to use imagination.

02:42.667 --> 02:44.700
My life's a romance novel.

02:44.767 --> 02:46.834
Your life is a sports page.

02:49.533 --> 02:52.834
Tell me I can't do better
than this in my sleep.

02:52.900 --> 02:54.333
"He grabbed her.

02:54.400 --> 02:58.000
She could feel his fingers
pressing into her moist flesh.

02:58.066 --> 03:01.967
Her heart was pounding,
her loins on fire,

03:02.033 --> 03:04.734
as he spun her around,
her dress ripping open..."

03:04.800 --> 03:07.200
You know how many times
I've experienced that?

03:11.934 --> 03:14.367
Your loins have been on fire?

03:19.900 --> 03:21.834
Yes.

03:23.066 --> 03:24.100
"She melted--"

03:24.166 --> 03:26.800
Where exactly are your loins?

03:29.033 --> 03:30.266
Rose, it doesn't matter. Listen.

03:30.333 --> 03:32.400
"She melted into his arms,

03:32.467 --> 03:34.967
faint now with
the animal musk of him."

03:35.033 --> 03:39.033
I didn't know people had loins.

03:39.100 --> 03:42.100
I've heard of loin of pork, but...

03:42.166 --> 03:44.066
In her case, the same thing.

03:48.867 --> 03:52.300
Dorothy, want to hear my idea?
You won't believe it.

03:52.367 --> 03:53.867
Sorry, Blanche, I can't.

03:53.934 --> 03:58.233
-What's the matter, Dorothy?
-I don't know what to do.

03:58.300 --> 04:04.266
I was in front of the class,
and I was too tired to talk.

04:04.333 --> 04:05.467
Not that they would've listened.

04:05.533 --> 04:07.433
They were too busy
sniffing the white-out

04:07.500 --> 04:09.433
they'd stolen from typing class.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.233
I had to excuse them early.

04:14.300 --> 04:19.467
I just cannot kick this flu,
and it's getting worse, not better.

04:19.533 --> 04:21.533
But it's been months now.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.533
Maybe it's not flu.
Flu doesn't last that long.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.467
Go back to Dr. Raymond.

04:26.533 --> 04:29.166
I did. He said I'm fine.

04:29.233 --> 04:30.367
Get a second opinion.

04:30.433 --> 04:32.834
She went to Dr. Schlesinger.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.734
Well, then, you are fine.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.533
Now, you want to hear my idea?

04:37.600 --> 04:40.333
She's not fine, Blanche.
Look at her.

04:40.400 --> 04:43.533
I said she was fine,
not she looks fine.

04:46.967 --> 04:48.467
She looks like hell.

04:50.233 --> 04:52.567
Thank you, Blanche.

04:52.633 --> 04:56.867
Oh, I think in my novel
my heroine will be sick.

04:56.934 --> 04:58.934
Tragically sick.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.433
But snatched back
from death by a doctor

05:02.500 --> 05:06.166
with the hands of a peasant
and the soul of a poet.

05:06.233 --> 05:08.066
Oh, my God, I'm writing already.

05:08.133 --> 05:10.500
Somebody take this down.

05:10.567 --> 05:12.166
What is she talking about?

05:12.233 --> 05:15.367
Forget her. Dorothy.
Raymond is not a specialist.

05:15.433 --> 05:17.867
But what kind of specialist
do I need?

05:17.934 --> 05:20.967
Just call Dr. Raymond
for a referral.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.800
You have to, honey.
You're getting sicker.

05:23.867 --> 05:26.800
Just like my heroine.
Sicker and sicker.

05:26.867 --> 05:31.400
Though, of course,
my heroine doesn't look like you.

05:31.467 --> 05:34.700
This is a romantic novel,
not science fiction.

05:37.800 --> 05:41.066
Remind me when I feel better
to kick the crap out of her.

05:43.133 --> 05:46.200
(calm music playing)

05:48.266 --> 05:52.500
Sorry to keep you waiting, Lorraine.

05:52.567 --> 05:53.967
No, I'm not Lorraine.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.567
-You're not Lorraine Maslansky?
-No.

05:56.633 --> 05:58.367
Really?
I have her chart.

05:58.433 --> 06:02.300
Hand me my purse.
I'll check my driver's license.

06:02.367 --> 06:06.734
I'm sorry. Then you must be...
oh, Dorothy.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.233
Right. Of course.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.200
Ok, we have Dorothy here.

06:10.266 --> 06:14.533
Right. Sorry to keep
you waiting Dorothy,

06:14.600 --> 06:16.667
but there was something
I had to attend to.

06:16.734 --> 06:19.100
-Oh, that's all right.
-A famous person.

06:19.166 --> 06:22.333
Very, very famous.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.633
But I can't tell you who it is.

06:23.700 --> 06:27.333
Ethics, you know.
We have to be quite careful.

06:27.400 --> 06:31.166
But if this was <i>Win, Lose, or Draw,</i>
I'd draw a crown.

06:34.467 --> 06:36.867
-What?
-That was a hint.

06:36.934 --> 06:39.467
Oh. You have my test results?

06:39.533 --> 06:41.033
-Sure do.
-And?

06:41.100 --> 06:44.333
A king, but that's it.
No more clues.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.867
Oh, come on, think about it.

06:47.934 --> 06:52.200
I don't care.
It could be the king of England.

06:52.266 --> 06:55.600
England doesn't have a king.
Try Saudi Arabia.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.567
All I'm thinking about
are my test results

06:58.633 --> 07:00.700
and keeping this gown closed.

07:00.767 --> 07:03.600
Well, you won't be needing it.

07:03.667 --> 07:05.433
Dorothy, get dressed.
You're fine.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.500
Excuse me?

07:06.567 --> 07:09.400
We've run every known test.
They're all normal.

07:09.467 --> 07:12.834
Get dressed, go home,
enjoy your life.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.934
Dr. Stevens, I was always healthy,

07:16.000 --> 07:19.433
then I caught this flu
I can't get rid of.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.200
I've been sick for five months.

07:22.266 --> 07:26.300
I have a constant sore throat,
swollen glands, fevers,

07:26.367 --> 07:30.433
my muscles ache and are weak,
I'm exhausted all the time.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.166
You told me.

07:32.233 --> 07:34.300
Well, maybe it bears repeating.

07:37.934 --> 07:41.433
Maybe you still think
I'm Lorraine Maslansky.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.533
-Can I ask personal questions?
-Yes.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.467
-You're divorced.
-Yes.

07:46.533 --> 07:49.967
How's your social life?
Do you see men?

07:52.166 --> 07:55.066
What in the world does seeing men
have to do with anything?

07:55.133 --> 07:58.367
Dorothy, we know that
if people aren't happy,

07:58.433 --> 08:02.333
and lonely people aren't,
they get all kinds of symptoms.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.633
Depression, fatigue...

08:05.533 --> 08:07.633
symptoms very much like
the ones you describe.

08:07.700 --> 08:11.834
Doctor, I don't think you
understand, so I'll tell you again.

08:11.900 --> 08:15.133
I'm at a point now
where I'm so exhausted

08:15.200 --> 08:17.066
that sometimes I cannot speak.

08:17.133 --> 08:19.533
Literally, cannot speak.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.600
There are days
when I can't get out of bed.

08:22.667 --> 08:27.767
Raising my arms to wash my hair
in the shower is too exhausting.

08:27.834 --> 08:30.100
I can't even do that.

08:30.166 --> 08:32.233
I have heart palpitations,

08:32.300 --> 08:37.967
I can't concentrate,
I forget things... I get confused.

08:38.033 --> 08:42.333
Dorothy, I don't believe
you're sick, but you do.

08:42.400 --> 08:46.033
You want to spend more money,
that's fine with me.

08:46.100 --> 08:48.433
So go to New York.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.200
See the man I studied with.

08:50.266 --> 08:53.166
He's the best
neurologist there is.

08:53.233 --> 08:56.033
If you have anything at all,
he'll find it.

08:57.533 --> 09:00.033
2 1/2 hours.
I thought you died.

09:00.100 --> 09:03.467
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

09:03.533 --> 09:04.467
Who are you?

09:04.533 --> 09:06.400
I'm the doctor.

09:06.467 --> 09:09.100
We'll see about that.

09:09.166 --> 09:10.934
Look, Mrs...

09:11.000 --> 09:14.133
Petrillo. I'm Dorothy's mother.
I want to know what's wrong.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.467
And don't tell me nothing.
Mothers know.

09:17.533 --> 09:19.834
Ma, I'll talk to you later.

09:19.900 --> 09:22.166
You're daughter's fine,
Mrs. Petrillo.

09:22.233 --> 09:23.934
-100%?
-100%.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.166
-Tip-top?
-Tip-top.

09:25.233 --> 09:29.133
Why the hell does
she feel like hell?

09:30.100 --> 09:31.767
-Ma--
-I got to hear this.

09:31.834 --> 09:33.233
It could be functional.

09:33.300 --> 09:34.500
Functional?

09:34.567 --> 09:35.800
Mental.

09:35.867 --> 09:39.834
Mental. Well,
let me tell you something,

09:39.900 --> 09:42.700
mister 100% tip-top mental,

09:42.767 --> 09:45.266
my daughter may be
no spring chicken

09:45.333 --> 09:47.900
and her jaw might crack
when she chews...

09:50.734 --> 09:56.333
and she may have noticeable trouble
digesting raw vegetables,

09:56.400 --> 09:59.600
but one thing she's not is mental.

10:00.800 --> 10:01.934
Thanks, Ma.

10:05.934 --> 10:08.533
(serene music playing)

10:08.600 --> 10:09.767
Ribs, great.

10:09.834 --> 10:12.233
Just kick the dentures
out of my mouth.

10:23.333 --> 10:27.100
We never had a barbecue
in St. Olaf.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.934
I guess we have to ask.

10:38.367 --> 10:39.600
No, we don't.

10:41.300 --> 10:44.533
She'll work it in anyway.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.767
What tragedy, Rose?

10:46.834 --> 10:47.934
I can't talk about it.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.300
-Fine.
-Good.

10:51.367 --> 10:53.900
But it had to do
with barbecuing elk,

10:53.967 --> 10:56.800
a big fire and someone
who lost his balance.

10:59.300 --> 11:01.266
-Got it.
-Clear as a bell.

11:02.767 --> 11:06.066
Now I know why Hemingway
killed himself.

11:06.133 --> 11:09.333
Girls, I have writer's block.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.734
It's the worst feeling in the world.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.700
Try 10 days without
a bowel movement sometime.

11:25.467 --> 11:29.600
You just sit there, hour after hour
after hour after hour.

11:32.767 --> 11:34.166
Tell me about it.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.767
I just don't know what to do.

11:42.834 --> 11:47.166
Nothing's worse than facing
that blank piece of paper.

11:47.233 --> 11:49.500
How much have you written?

11:49.567 --> 11:51.066
That's just it, nothing.

11:51.133 --> 11:54.567
That's how I know
I have writer's block.

11:54.633 --> 11:58.367
You have to have written
to have writer's block.

11:58.433 --> 12:00.266
Otherwise, all of us have it.

12:08.100 --> 12:10.633
Maybe I ought to go
to New York with you.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.567
It's a writer's city.

12:12.633 --> 12:17.500
I could hang out at the Algonquin,
get the juices going.

12:17.567 --> 12:20.133
I'm going just for two days.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.133
Rose is going with me.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.533
Rose? Why her?

12:24.600 --> 12:25.734
She's comforting.

12:25.800 --> 12:26.800
I'm not?

12:26.867 --> 12:31.233
You said you got a pedicure
when your husband was dying.

12:31.734 --> 12:33.700
Of course, I did.

12:33.767 --> 12:36.066
It was the third Thursday
of the month.

12:36.133 --> 12:38.967
If I'd canceled, that would have
finished off summer,

12:39.033 --> 12:42.233
when I wear open-toed sandals.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.133
Angel of mercy.

12:46.166 --> 12:50.367
How could I know
he'd pick that hour to die?

12:50.433 --> 12:53.533
He was in a coma.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.967
He'd been in a coma for days.

12:57.033 --> 13:00.333
I happen to be very good
with sick people.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.867
I was once a candy stripper.

13:07.066 --> 13:08.734
That's striper.

13:09.834 --> 13:11.133
Whatever.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.767
You know, a volunteer.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.867
I want to go to New York.

13:14.934 --> 13:17.200
How come Rose gets to?

13:17.266 --> 13:22.400
When I'm not feeling well,
Rose makes me feel ok.

13:22.467 --> 13:25.533
What is she, your best friend?

13:25.600 --> 13:27.300
Rose knows I'm sick.

13:27.367 --> 13:28.867
I know you're sick.

13:28.934 --> 13:32.033
God knows, you always tell me.

13:33.433 --> 13:37.266
What a waste.
Rose Nylund in New York.

13:37.333 --> 13:39.166
It'll be a great trip.

13:39.233 --> 13:41.800
Wait and see.
You'll be cured.

13:41.867 --> 13:43.967
I'll see the big potato.

13:52.667 --> 13:55.734
I said she was comforting.
I didn't say she was smart.

14:00.567 --> 14:03.433
(soft music playing)

14:03.500 --> 14:06.100
So, what are you doing here?

14:06.166 --> 14:07.300
You've seen everybody.

14:07.367 --> 14:09.367
Nobody found anything wrong.

14:09.433 --> 14:12.834
-There are no more tests to run.
-But I--

14:12.900 --> 14:16.700
Your main complaint is you're tired.

14:16.767 --> 14:18.133
I get tired too.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.333
It's called getting old.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.300
That's not what this is.

14:21.367 --> 14:22.600
I am sick.

14:22.667 --> 14:26.600
I gave up my job
because I was too tired.

14:26.667 --> 14:27.734
How'd you get here?

14:27.800 --> 14:29.367
I flew.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.033
No. To my office.

14:31.100 --> 14:32.800
-A taxi.
-From the taxi?

14:32.867 --> 14:35.266
To your office?

14:35.333 --> 14:36.800
Not a hard question.

14:38.266 --> 14:39.066
I walked.

14:39.133 --> 14:40.600
Right, you walked.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.967
You're not sick, Dorothy.

14:43.033 --> 14:44.633
People I see can't walk.

14:44.700 --> 14:45.934
They can't swallow.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.667
Some of them can't breathe.

14:47.734 --> 14:49.567
Don't take this wrong.

14:49.633 --> 14:51.900
Have you considered
seeing a psychiatrist?

14:51.967 --> 14:55.300
I have seen two.
Here are their letters.

14:55.367 --> 14:58.433
They both say nothing is wrong
with me psychologically.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.367
It's physical.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.934
So, what?
Psychiatry is not a science.

15:04.433 --> 15:06.400
Then why suggest
I see one?

15:06.467 --> 15:09.433
Because what you have
is not scientific.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.633
Should I send you to
new Mexico to a shaman?

15:13.133 --> 15:16.934
There's nothing wrong with you,
except what happens to all of us.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.367
You're not 30 anymore.

15:19.867 --> 15:21.967
Take a cruise, Dorothy.

15:22.033 --> 15:23.200
Go to a hypnotist.

15:23.266 --> 15:24.934
Change your hair color.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.667
My wife became blond.
She's a new woman.

15:29.266 --> 15:33.133
(mellow music playing)

15:33.200 --> 15:34.934
Room service?

15:35.033 --> 15:37.066
This is Rose Nylund.

15:37.133 --> 15:40.200
I'm staying here
in your lovely hotel.

15:40.266 --> 15:42.433
Well, I think I need
a new menu.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.300
Mine seems to be full of mistakes.

15:45.367 --> 15:50.967
It says a small glass
of tomato juice is $6.

15:55.633 --> 15:56.967
I see.

15:58.633 --> 16:01.300
Room service,
I'll have to call you back.

16:01.367 --> 16:03.367
What happened?
What did he say?

16:03.433 --> 16:04.433
Nothing.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.567
He said what everyone said.

16:06.633 --> 16:10.133
Oh, no. That's terrible.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.266
Oh, Dorothy, I'm so sorry.

16:12.333 --> 16:14.734
I thought surely
he'd find something,

16:14.800 --> 16:17.000
so you would at least
have a name for this thing.

16:17.066 --> 16:19.600
Let's not talk about that.
How was your day?

16:19.667 --> 16:21.300
Forget about my day.

16:21.367 --> 16:23.600
-He said nothing new?
-Nothing.

16:23.667 --> 16:26.567
Come on,
you've never been here.

16:26.633 --> 16:28.900
What do you think?

16:28.967 --> 16:31.934
I don't know
how people live here.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.567
It's very interesting,
and everything in the world's here,

16:35.633 --> 16:39.400
but it's so tall and so crowded

16:39.467 --> 16:42.900
and so noisy and so much.

16:42.967 --> 16:46.467
I've never seen so much
of everything my whole life.

16:46.533 --> 16:48.734
I went to Bloomingdale's,
the store?

16:49.233 --> 16:53.100
I swear, St. Olaf could fit into it.

16:53.166 --> 16:56.333
I went to the top of
the Empire state building.

16:56.400 --> 16:59.233
You know what
I don't understand?

16:59.300 --> 17:04.667
How come the fall didn't kill
King Kong instantly?

17:04.734 --> 17:09.300
I mean, sure he was big,
but that's 102 stories.

17:09.367 --> 17:10.800
You look down...

17:13.233 --> 17:19.000
I know. It was a sad movie.
I cried too.

17:19.066 --> 17:22.367
Every time I see it, I hope maybe
this time it will be different.

17:22.433 --> 17:24.500
Maybe this time he won't
die.

17:24.567 --> 17:27.233
But he always does.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.367
It was only a movie.

17:29.433 --> 17:32.934
That was really a fake gorilla.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.567
Oh, Rose, that's not it.

17:35.633 --> 17:37.700
What is it, Dorothy?
What happened?

17:39.767 --> 17:42.867
Maybe I am crazy.

17:42.934 --> 17:45.200
Nobody believes me.

17:45.266 --> 17:47.734
Everybody thinks I'm crazy.
Maybe I am.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.433
Maybe I'm really crazy.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.900
Oh, Dorothy, you are not crazy.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.900
You are absolutely not crazy.

17:54.967 --> 17:56.767
I see how you walk.

17:56.834 --> 17:59.633
I see how wiped out you get.

17:59.700 --> 18:03.066
You're not crazy, honey.
You're sick.

18:03.133 --> 18:04.867
I think so too.

18:04.934 --> 18:07.300
I really do.

18:07.367 --> 18:08.667
But nobody believes me.

18:08.734 --> 18:12.500
Doctors don't know everything,
Dorothy.

18:12.567 --> 18:13.300
You're right.

18:13.367 --> 18:16.500
They think they do, but they don't.

18:16.567 --> 18:17.433
You're right.

18:17.500 --> 18:21.300
I mean, after all,
Dr. Seuss was a doctor too.

18:26.967 --> 18:30.767
(serene music playing)

18:30.834 --> 18:32.266
I'm gonna finish it tonight.

18:32.333 --> 18:34.367
I don't care
if I never sleep a wink.

18:34.433 --> 18:38.567
It's like giving birth.
Once you start you can't stop.

18:39.900 --> 18:43.734
Actually, you can.
Ingrid Thermann stopped.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.133
What was she writing?

18:46.200 --> 18:51.100
She wasn't. She was giving birth
to Hanz and Franz, the twins.

18:51.166 --> 18:53.867
And she stopped right in the middle.
Right after Hanz.

18:55.900 --> 18:59.000
-What happened to Franz?
-He stayed in.

19:01.767 --> 19:02.734
For how long?

19:02.800 --> 19:04.333
I don't know.
A long time.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.266
They were a year apart
in school.

19:14.767 --> 19:16.433
That's impossible.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.033
No, it isn't.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.467
How is she?

19:19.533 --> 19:22.834
Wiped out and depressed.
She tries to hide it.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.834
She'll be ok. I know it.

19:25.900 --> 19:28.767
She will, Sophia.
She's tough.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.400
There are all sorts
of things people get

19:31.467 --> 19:33.300
that they can't diagnose.

19:33.367 --> 19:36.633
Then they disappear as mysteriously
as they came.

19:36.700 --> 19:40.767
Gustav Lundquist got sick
from something mysterious

19:40.834 --> 19:42.967
and nearly died.

19:43.033 --> 19:44.767
Well, he did die.

19:46.300 --> 19:50.367
Then at the cemetery,
Beatrice Lundquist, his wife,

19:50.433 --> 19:53.133
kept screaming, "He's alive!
He's alive!

19:53.200 --> 19:55.300
I can hear him from the grave."

19:55.367 --> 19:58.467
Everybody thought it was the
hallucinations of a grieving widow,

19:58.533 --> 20:00.600
so they sedated her.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.800
But when she woke up,

20:03.867 --> 20:07.633
she told them that
he said from the grave,

20:07.700 --> 20:12.600
"We never paid our '78
through '86 income taxes."

20:12.667 --> 20:16.100
His partner said,
"Only Gustav would know that.

20:16.166 --> 20:17.800
He must be alive."

20:18.300 --> 20:20.867
So they all raced
to the cemetery,

20:20.934 --> 20:23.834
and the entire town
started digging like crazy,

20:23.900 --> 20:26.400
kneeling by the grave,
using their hands even,

20:26.467 --> 20:29.166
dirt flying and Beatrice screaming.

20:29.233 --> 20:35.166
And when they opened that coffin,
there he was, dead as a doornail.

20:44.567 --> 20:47.834
What is the point of that ridiculous
story, Rose?

20:47.900 --> 20:52.700
The point is Gustav didn't die
from his mysterious disease.

20:52.767 --> 20:54.967
He lived and recovered.

20:55.033 --> 20:57.700
The trouble was he recovered
while he was buried.

20:57.767 --> 21:00.934
Before they got to him,
he had suffocated.

21:03.133 --> 21:06.533
I just don't believe
these stories you tell.

21:06.600 --> 21:10.600
The other tragic aspect was
the IRS was waiting at the cemetery

21:10.667 --> 21:13.934
to arrest Gustav's partner
Bergstrom.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.333
So Bergstrom killed himself
right then and there

21:17.400 --> 21:21.934
by grabbing the gun from sheriff
Tokvist and shooting himself.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.834
What they did then,
since the grave was still open...

21:27.800 --> 21:30.033
and everybody was right there,

21:30.100 --> 21:32.967
and Gustav and Bergstrom
had been partners,

21:33.033 --> 21:38.300
so they put Bergstrom in with
Gustav and had a double burial.

21:39.633 --> 21:41.934
Unfortunately, later they found out

21:42.033 --> 21:45.700
that Bergstrom wanted
to be cremated.

21:45.767 --> 21:48.633
Oh, shut up, Rose!

21:51.233 --> 21:55.033
The worst thing
is your child dying before you.

21:55.100 --> 21:57.967
-Dorothy is not dying.
-I know.

21:58.033 --> 21:59.133
She'll be fine.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.900
I know.

22:00.967 --> 22:02.700
Why do you do that, Rose?

22:02.767 --> 22:05.400
Why make up stories?

22:05.467 --> 22:08.333
It wouldn't feel right
to live anymore.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.867
If a kid dies,
it wouldn't feel fair.

22:10.934 --> 22:13.467
Sophia, Dorothy is not dying.

22:13.533 --> 22:14.734
How do you know?

22:14.800 --> 22:15.967
I know.

22:16.033 --> 22:18.000
Honey, she's right.

22:18.066 --> 22:21.934
I know too, and I'm a writer.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.066
I see things more clearly
than the average person.

22:25.133 --> 22:27.300
My perceptions are keener.

22:27.367 --> 22:30.000
Oh, knock it off,
Blanche.

22:31.266 --> 22:34.867
Sophia, we have all
seen our husbands die.

22:34.934 --> 22:36.233
We know what that is.

22:36.300 --> 22:38.667
Except for her.
She was getting a manicure.

22:41.667 --> 22:42.500
Pedicure.

22:42.567 --> 22:47.233
I'm 80-something.
I've seen more death than you.

22:47.300 --> 22:48.433
Over these five months,

22:48.500 --> 22:52.133
we've seen a healthy
woman waste away.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.266
She can't do anything.

22:54.333 --> 22:58.900
So they don't have
a name for it yet.

22:58.967 --> 23:01.900
There were lots of diseases
without names.

23:01.967 --> 23:03.600
You think they had a name
for the black plague

23:03.667 --> 23:05.367
when one guy had it?

23:05.433 --> 23:09.400
Thousands died before
they knew what it was.

23:09.467 --> 23:12.600
Dorothy could be dying
and they don't know it.

23:13.100 --> 23:16.600
(sad music playing)

23:24.400 --> 23:28.166
(theme music playing)
