01:18.329 --> 01:20.498
Physician Wong,
there was drought this year.

01:20.707 --> 01:21.750
I can only pay you this much.

01:21.958 --> 01:24.586
WONG: Pay me next time.
Your child is malnourished.

01:24.794 --> 01:25.920
Buy him some nutritious food.

01:28.798 --> 01:30.216
Pa!

01:30.425 --> 01:31.509
What is it, Fei-Hung?

01:31.718 --> 01:34.304
- Pa, Ma is looking for you.
- Oh.

01:35.722 --> 01:38.558
- What does your mother want?
- Hurry, Pa!

01:38.767 --> 01:39.893
Hey. Hey, slow down!

01:40.101 --> 01:41.978
- Come on!
- (LAUGHS) Hey. Wait up!

01:42.979 --> 01:47.442
- Fei-Hung, watch your step.
- Ma, Pa is here!

All right, Fei-Hung.
Practice your kung fu.

Don't strain yourself.

- (FEI-HUNG GRUNTING)
- I'm fine. I can manage.

02:00.413 --> 02:04.083
All right, all right, don't push yourself.

02:04.292 --> 02:08.170
Look at you, you need more rest.

02:08.378 --> 02:12.217
Leave the housework to Ah Jin.
Don't make me worry.

02:12.425 --> 02:13.885
I'll be careful.

02:14.093 --> 02:18.681
You should pay more attention to Fei-Hung.
That'll be a load off my mind.

02:18.890 --> 02:22.727
I will, I will.
My teacher will be here tonight.

02:22.936 --> 02:25.396
He can talk to Fei-Hung tonight.

02:26.397 --> 02:29.234
Oh, no! I forgot about it!

02:29.442 --> 02:31.694
Master Lok usually visits us
at this time of the year.

02:31.903 --> 02:34.364
We are running out of rice and meat.
I'll go buy some more.

02:49.254 --> 02:51.673
Lok Ah Choi, it's been a while.

02:53.299 --> 02:54.717
Who are you?

02:54.801 --> 02:58.304
(LAUGHS) Lok Ah Choi,
you've been a rebel for years.

02:58.513 --> 02:59.764
You are our most wanted fugitive.

02:59.973 --> 03:02.725
With the help of Heaven,
I finally found you.

03:02.934 --> 03:05.937
Oh, lackeys from the imperial court.

03:06.145 --> 03:08.815
Fine, catch me if you can.

03:11.442 --> 03:12.777
Lok...

03:19.659 --> 03:22.245
I'm so sorry. I got the wrong person.

I'll get rid of you today!

MANSION OF GENERAL WEI

06:50.953 --> 06:54.457
General Wei, loads of refugees
have swamped Guangzhou city.

06:54.665 --> 06:57.210
Some are even camping on our doorstep.

07:03.674 --> 07:06.094
I have just taken up this post

07:06.302 --> 07:08.679
and disaster strikes Guangzhou.

07:08.888 --> 07:11.265
This is inauspicious.

07:12.433 --> 07:16.395
Well, give the refugees some food
from our stockpile.

07:16.604 --> 07:20.108
General, the quantity of food
we ration out is based on headcount.

07:20.316 --> 07:22.527
We don't have any to spare.

07:23.861 --> 07:26.405
I have my plans.
Go ahead and distribute the food.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.199
Yes, General.

07:28.407 --> 07:29.826
I have another matter to report.

07:30.034 --> 07:32.286
I have gathered some information
on the opium dens

07:32.495 --> 07:34.372
that you asked me to investigate.

07:34.580 --> 07:37.208
Most of the opium dens
are controlled by the Ma gang.

07:37.416 --> 07:41.045
The gang leader, Ma Mo,
is a powerful man in Guangzhou.

07:44.715 --> 07:46.717
We'll strike where it hurts.

who defends Guangzhou.

08:14.453 --> 08:17.456
You're under suspicion of smuggling opium.

08:17.665 --> 08:20.459
We want to inspect your warehouses,

08:20.668 --> 08:23.379
so step aside
if you know what's good for you.

08:23.588 --> 08:28.092
I've never heard of any general
who defends Guangzhou.

08:28.301 --> 08:32.221
This city belongs to the Ma gang.

08:32.429 --> 08:36.601
We run the place. You are nothing here.

This is a medical hall?

I will do my best to heal him.

23:04.843 --> 23:08.305
Uh, no. Nothing, General.

Your injury requires
more than just medicine.

23:11.975 --> 23:15.645
You will need acupuncture
to boost circulation.

24:08.073 --> 24:09.533
Try putting some weight on it now.

24:09.699 --> 24:10.742
All right.

24:17.040 --> 24:21.086
Physician Wong, you're a marvelous healer!

24:21.294 --> 24:23.713
What was that treatment you used?

24:23.922 --> 24:26.716
It's called, "Nine Phoenixes Sing Thrice,"

24:26.883 --> 24:30.720
where the nine acupuncture needles
are set to resonate thrice.

24:30.887 --> 24:33.974
- Oh.
- It's an esoteric technique.

24:34.891 --> 24:37.602
Huh. Nine Phoenixes...

24:39.062 --> 24:41.565
General, I'll be taking my leave now.

24:41.731 --> 24:45.652
Wait, let me pay you for your service.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.237
No, General.

24:48.238 --> 24:50.740
It's an honor to tend to your injury.

24:51.491 --> 24:52.742
I appreciate the gesture,

24:52.951 --> 24:55.245
but I couldn't possibly
accept your silver.

24:55.453 --> 24:58.999
Uh-huh. In that case, I will not insist on it.

24:59.249 --> 25:02.419
I may need your services again someday.

25:02.586 --> 25:04.254
I'm always glad to help.

25:04.462 --> 25:09.259
Hmm. I have to go out, too.
Shall I give you a lift?

25:09.426 --> 25:12.095
If it's not out of your way.

27:03.081 --> 27:04.457
Retreat!

27:10.797 --> 27:14.634
Who were those people, General?
How dare they attack a court official!

27:15.093 --> 27:18.972
Oh... They were probably rebels.

27:20.807 --> 27:23.435
I didn't know you're such
a skilled pugilist.

27:23.643 --> 27:26.479
I should be calling you "Master Wong."

27:26.730 --> 27:29.941
That was Shaolin kung fu you wielded.

27:30.150 --> 27:33.111
Is your master a Shaolin monk?

27:33.320 --> 27:36.656
My master was just
an old street performer.

27:36.906 --> 27:39.409
I took up martial arts
just to strengthen my body.

27:39.617 --> 27:42.620
Those moves I learned could hardly
qualify as proper kung fu.

27:42.829 --> 27:45.123
What? Not qualify as proper kung fu?

27:45.332 --> 27:48.460
You're a formidable fighter!

27:48.918 --> 27:52.922
(CHUCKLES) Master Wong,
you're from Foshan.

27:53.131 --> 27:56.801
It is home to several bands of rebels.

27:57.010 --> 28:00.013
Do you know anything of them?

28:00.263 --> 28:03.266
General, I am a humble physician.

28:03.433 --> 28:05.602
I steer clear of these affairs.

28:05.769 --> 28:10.440
I'm afraid I know nothing of rebels
and the like.

28:10.940 --> 28:11.941
Oh.

28:12.025 --> 28:14.611
How could this happen, you fools!

28:14.778 --> 28:17.947
You outnumbered Wei Mo-Gik,
yet he got away unscathed!

28:18.156 --> 28:21.618
Am I right, Hong Sum? Right, Fong-Sin?

28:21.826 --> 28:24.454
Hong Sum sounded the retreat!

28:24.621 --> 28:27.707
- Otherwise we would have killed Wei!
- That's nonsense!

28:27.957 --> 28:31.503
We've been keeping tabs on Wei Mo-Gik,
he should have been alone today.

28:31.711 --> 28:34.339
Who knew Wong Kei-Ying would be with him?

28:34.547 --> 28:38.051
Wong is highly-skilled.
We had no choice but to beat a retreat.

28:38.301 --> 28:41.888
Hong Sum, calm down.
Fong-Sin, is that what happened?

28:42.138 --> 28:46.810
I exchanged blows with Wong Kei-Ying.
He isn't all that powerful.

28:46.976 --> 28:50.397
(GROWLS) Hong Sum,
go and get rid of Wong Kei-Ying.

29:18.049 --> 29:20.510
It's you? Brother Hong,
why are you doing this?

29:20.677 --> 29:23.179
You thwarted our attempt
on Wei Mo-Gik's life today.

29:23.346 --> 29:25.974

30:06.681 --> 30:09.726
How dare you turn against me

30:09.893 --> 30:12.020
and side with Wong Kei-Ying!

30:12.228 --> 30:14.355
Have you turned against me? Have you, huh?

30:14.564 --> 30:19.694
Chief, he really is highly skilled
in martial arts. We're no match for him.

30:20.737 --> 30:25.074
We could have defeated Wong Kei-Ying
if we'd joined forces against him.

30:25.241 --> 30:27.577
- It's his fault that we lost!
- Stay the hell out of it!

30:27.744 --> 30:30.205
You stay out of it!

30:31.873 --> 30:34.375
Wong Kei-Ying was struck
by the poisoned dart.

But what is it?

30:48.723 --> 30:50.975
- It's a round biscuit.
- Right, a round biscuit.

30:53.311 --> 30:55.230
Take a bite.

30:56.272 --> 30:58.399
- No, I don't want it.
- Go on, take a bite.

31:03.571 --> 31:04.948
Why?

31:06.282 --> 31:08.618
I offended the Ma gang.

31:08.826 --> 31:11.788
They'll be back for revenge.

31:13.331 --> 31:16.668
If anything should happen to you,
I would be letting your sister down.

31:16.918 --> 31:19.504
Well, that's all the more reason
for me to stay.

31:19.754 --> 31:23.675
Sister would be mad
if I were to abandon you.

31:23.925 --> 31:28.012
Besides, Fei-Hung,
do you want me to leave?

31:29.430 --> 31:30.640
No, I don't.

31:30.848 --> 31:35.019
You don't? You don't, but your father
wants me to go home.

31:35.937 --> 31:39.649

I don't want Auntie to leave.

38:42.571 --> 38:44.949

43:00.371 --> 43:02.456
Everyone wants a slice of that pie.

43:02.998 --> 43:07.336
You can be sure the Westerners
have found someone to take over Ma's dens

43:07.878 --> 43:10.172
to keep the money flowing in.

43:11.507 --> 43:14.009
Hmm. If I can figure out a cure

43:15.010 --> 43:18.055
for opium addiction,

43:19.682 --> 43:22.393
the opium dens would go
out of business, wouldn't they?

43:22.893 --> 43:24.687
OFFICER: Is Master Wong in?

43:30.901 --> 43:33.821
Officer, what brings you here today?

43:34.029 --> 43:36.699
The General needs your help urgently.

43:36.865 --> 43:40.035
Please grab your medicine chest
and come with me.

43:40.202 --> 43:41.245
I'll go right away.

43:56.051 --> 43:57.177
General.

43:59.430 --> 44:04.852
Ah, Master Wong, a prisoner under my charge
is in critical condition.

44:05.102 --> 44:06.562
Please be sure to save him.

44:06.770 --> 44:10.065
Otherwise, I won't be able
to answer to my superiors.

44:10.232 --> 44:13.068
Don't worry, General. I will do my best.

44:13.277 --> 44:14.903
I'm counting on you.

44:15.738 --> 44:16.780
This way.

44:29.043 --> 44:31.462
Master Wong, this is the man.

44:49.146 --> 44:50.147
(BREATH TREMBLING)

44:54.902 --> 44:58.781
Master Wong, is he all right?

45:04.578 --> 45:07.331
General. He is seriously injured.

45:07.956 --> 45:12.753
He will need treatment
in order to survive.

45:13.629 --> 45:16.590
Ah, Master Wong, I'm counting on your help.

45:16.965 --> 45:18.759
He must not die on my watch.

45:19.635 --> 45:20.636
Of course.

45:21.470 --> 45:24.098
Healing the sick is a physician's duty.

45:25.432 --> 45:28.102
General, what was this man's crime?

45:28.977 --> 45:30.312
He is Lok Ah Choi.

45:31.146 --> 45:34.483
He is the court's most wanted fugitive.

45:36.318 --> 45:40.656
General, can you unchain him
so that I can treat him?

45:49.623 --> 45:51.125
- Unchain him.
- Yes, General.

46:14.898 --> 46:17.025
- Open the door.
- Yes, officer.

46:35.878 --> 46:38.714
Get up. Come on!
Get up and drink your medicine!

46:40.507 --> 46:42.217
Get up and take the medicine!

46:49.266 --> 46:51.393
You... Why are...

46:57.399 --> 47:01.195
Get lost! I'm not taking your medicine!

47:02.905 --> 47:04.031
What are you doing here?

47:04.239 --> 47:07.242
I'm here on General Wei Mo-Gik's command.
Just do as you're told.

47:07.451 --> 47:08.702
What did you say?

47:09.536 --> 47:11.872
Wei Mo-Gik? How did you get to know him?

47:12.080 --> 47:15.959
I noticed his injury
when he was distributing rations.

47:16.210 --> 47:17.628
I thought he was an honest official,

47:18.253 --> 47:20.631
so I offered to treat him.

47:22.883 --> 47:25.093
Teacher, how did you become a fugitive?

47:25.302 --> 47:28.263
I became a fugitive
ever since the traitorous Wei Mo-Gik

47:29.431 --> 47:31.600
left Southern Shaolin temple in ruins.

47:32.434 --> 47:36.480
I kept it from you
in order not to implicate you.

47:37.147 --> 47:40.234
Teacher, how did you get captured?

47:41.109 --> 47:42.819
He waylaid me last month

47:43.070 --> 47:46.949
<i>when I was on my way
to your medical hall.</i>

47:47.115 --> 47:50.452
No wonder the shape of his wound

47:50.619 --> 47:53.288
looked so familiar
when I was treating him.

47:55.749 --> 47:57.626
Kei-Ying, give me some.

47:58.669 --> 47:59.753
Teacher!

48:00.128 --> 48:03.298
- Just one mouthful! Give it to me!
- Teacher!

48:03.840 --> 48:06.677
- Teacher! Teacher!
- Just one mouthful!

48:06.927 --> 48:08.637
You inside! Time's up!

48:08.804 --> 48:10.305
Come out now!

48:10.472 --> 48:13.809
Give me some!

48:13.976 --> 48:16.436
- Stop it!
- Just one mouthful!

48:16.645 --> 48:17.771
Let go of me!

48:19.439 --> 48:21.858
(GROANING) Just give me one mouthful!

48:26.697 --> 48:28.532
Give it to me!

48:28.907 --> 48:30.200
(SCREAMS)

49:11.491 --> 49:13.035
Master Wong!

49:28.842 --> 49:30.218
ALL: Thank you, Master Wong!

49:30.427 --> 49:31.553
Ling!

49:32.554 --> 49:33.555
(GASPS)

49:34.348 --> 49:35.891
(BOTH GRUNTING)

49:37.267 --> 49:41.063
Stop that!
How could you attack our benefactor?

49:41.229 --> 49:44.066
Wong Kei-Ying is my enemy.

49:45.567 --> 49:47.527
He put me behind bars.

49:47.736 --> 49:52.366
You deserve punishment
for all the crimes you committed.

49:52.574 --> 49:55.744
Master Wong saved Ling
despite the evil you did.

49:55.952 --> 49:57.287
Did you know that?

49:57.579 --> 49:59.206
Ma!

50:01.541 --> 50:02.876
(CHUCKLES)

50:02.959 --> 50:05.921
Ling! You can walk again!

50:07.589 --> 50:10.217
- That's great!
- Ma!

50:11.426 --> 50:13.929
Uncle Wong saved my life.

50:18.266 --> 50:22.396
My child suffered because of me.

50:27.943 --> 50:30.404
Ling, kneel down.

50:31.071 --> 50:33.156
Master Wong, I was wrong.

50:33.407 --> 50:35.951
Miss Lam, please get up.

50:37.661 --> 50:41.331
I saved your child because
that was my duty as a physician.

50:41.581 --> 50:44.668
Fortunately, Ling didn't drink
the medicine that was brewed today.

50:44.918 --> 50:48.755
If he did, it would be difficult

50:49.297 --> 50:51.967
to cure him of his opium addiction.

50:52.634 --> 50:54.803
In fact, I was instigated by Wei Mo-Gik

50:56.138 --> 50:57.305
to poison your medicine.

50:57.514 --> 50:58.640
It was him?

50:59.891 --> 51:02.018
(GASPING)

51:02.102 --> 51:03.145
Can you get me out of here?

51:03.311 --> 51:05.272
On the condition
that you complete a task for me.

51:05.480 --> 51:08.483
I'm willing to do anything
as long as I can get out of here.

51:08.942 --> 51:11.653
Wong Kei-Ying's crusade
to cure opium addiction

51:11.862 --> 51:13.488
has affected our bottom line.

51:15.157 --> 51:18.160
You have to find a way
to undermine his cure.

51:19.161 --> 51:22.956
Wei Mo-Gik has taken control
of all the opium dens.

51:23.665 --> 51:25.292
There is no one left to oppose him.

51:25.500 --> 51:26.793
How despicable of him!

51:28.170 --> 51:32.841
He built a good reputation
by helping the refugees.

51:33.967 --> 51:35.552
No one would expect him to be

51:37.053 --> 51:39.514
the villain behind the scene!

51:48.523 --> 51:50.859
General, Wong Kei-Ying is here.

51:52.360 --> 51:54.529
He can't take it lying down any longer.

51:54.738 --> 51:56.698
If he attempts to save Lok Ah Choi,

51:57.532 --> 52:00.202
- we'll get him.
- Yes, General.

52:07.876 --> 52:09.002
Teacher.

52:12.589 --> 52:16.176
LOK: (WEAKLY)
Something doesn't feel right today.

52:16.510 --> 52:20.055
Leave now and don't ever come back again.

52:20.222 --> 52:23.558
Teacher, just do as I say.

52:25.268 --> 52:26.853
- (WEAPON PIERCES)
- (SCREAMING)

52:29.189 --> 52:30.232
Let's go.

52:30.398 --> 52:35.403
Lok Ah Choi, wake up! Lok Ah Choi,
you can't die! Lok Ah Choi!

52:36.238 --> 52:40.534
Wake up, Lok Ah Choi!
Lok Ah Choi, don't die! Lok Ah Choi!

52:55.382 --> 52:56.424
You...

53:00.303 --> 53:04.766
General, I'm so sorry.
I wasn't able to save

53:06.101 --> 53:07.644
Lok Ah Choi's life.

53:14.234 --> 53:17.988
Guards! Take Wong Kei-Ying into custody.

53:18.238 --> 53:20.782
- And get rid of Lok Ah Choi's body.
- Yes, General.

53:41.636 --> 53:44.139
Don't be so rude. Release Master Wong.

53:45.765 --> 53:48.018
- Leave us.
- Yes, General.

53:49.769 --> 53:52.022
Master Wong, take a seat.

53:53.648 --> 53:54.983
Thank you, General.

54:02.157 --> 54:06.870
Wong Kei-Ying, Lok Ah Choi
was the court's most wanted fugitive.

54:07.537 --> 54:13.710
But he died on your watch.
Surely you're aware of the consequences.

54:15.670 --> 54:18.965
I don't understand
what you're trying to say, General.

54:20.216 --> 54:23.178
(CHUCKLES)
If you can help me do something,

54:23.345 --> 54:26.473
I won't hold you responsible
for Lok Ah Choi's death.

54:26.681 --> 54:31.061
General, I'm just a physician.
What could I possibly do for you?

54:32.062 --> 54:33.104
(CHUCKLES)

54:33.188 --> 54:34.189
It's a simple task.

54:35.023 --> 54:39.361
I was inspired by the medicine
you used to treat my leg.

54:40.820 --> 54:43.031
I want you to use your method

54:43.198 --> 54:46.534
to refine opium paste for me.

54:47.869 --> 54:50.872
The quality of the opium paste
that's available in the market now

54:51.081 --> 54:52.207
is inferior.

54:52.666 --> 54:54.918
There's barely a kick when you smoke it.

54:56.002 --> 54:59.673
If I know the method to refine it,

55:00.048 --> 55:03.385
I can gain the upper hand
when cutting a deal with the Westerners.

55:04.886 --> 55:08.556
We'll be rich in no time.

55:12.394 --> 55:15.563
I thought you were a good official.

55:15.855 --> 55:17.607
I had such high hopes of you.

55:18.400 --> 55:21.569
I never expected you to be so greedy.

55:22.404 --> 55:24.406
You are despicable!

55:26.074 --> 55:28.410
I will never help you do
something so evil.

55:28.910 --> 55:30.370
(LAUGHING)

55:35.583 --> 55:36.960
Wong Kei-Ying,

55:37.877 --> 55:39.963
haven't you figured it out yet?

55:41.631 --> 55:44.718
I've been spying on you and Lok Ah Choi.

55:44.926 --> 55:47.929
Everything points to the fact
that you know him.

55:49.597 --> 55:51.641
Fearing that he would rat you out,

55:52.392 --> 55:55.562
you decided to silence him
once and for all.

55:56.229 --> 55:58.815
Lok Ah Choi was the court's
most wanted fugitive.

55:59.149 --> 56:03.153
I could have you executed
for what you did.

56:03.778 --> 56:04.821
General,

56:06.489 --> 56:10.744
Lok Ah Choi's death only proves
that I'm a mediocre physician.

56:17.208 --> 56:18.251
(CHUCKLES)

56:18.334 --> 56:21.504
You have no choice

56:22.964 --> 56:25.175
but to cooperate with me.

56:36.603 --> 56:37.645
Fei-Hung...

56:44.652 --> 56:45.695
Let's go!

57:08.510 --> 57:09.511
(GRUNTS)

57:16.226 --> 57:18.686
- Master Wong!
- Keep your cool.

57:48.424 --> 57:51.219
Master Wong, were we too late?

57:51.594 --> 57:54.222
No, as long as we remove the needle
within two hours.

57:55.890 --> 57:58.393
Then why isn't he waking up yet?

58:01.396 --> 58:02.438
(COUGHING)

58:03.022 --> 58:05.191
- Teacher!
- Master Lok!

58:13.700 --> 58:15.785
Master Wong, we will provide you

58:16.035 --> 58:17.787
with all the opium paste you need.

58:18.746 --> 58:20.748
Don't keep the General waiting.

58:21.416 --> 58:23.585
I'll work as fast as I can. Don't worry.

58:57.452 --> 59:00.622
Kei-Ying, you're not really going to help
Wei Mo-Gik, are you?

59:03.082 --> 59:06.628
I went along with him in order
to come back to save my teacher.

59:07.420 --> 59:10.256
Also I was worried about you and Fei-Hung.

59:10.924 --> 59:11.966
Don't worry.

59:12.342 --> 59:14.594
I would never cooperate
with such a villain.

59:15.428 --> 59:17.472
Hmm. Master Wong,
what are we going to do now?

59:17.972 --> 59:20.475
Teacher's opium addiction
is already deep-rooted.

59:20.934 --> 59:24.020
If we don't help him kick the habit,
he won't have long to live.

59:24.812 --> 59:29.150
We'll use Wei Mo-Gik's opium paste
to formulate the cure.

59:30.151 --> 59:33.029
I'll start working on it today.

01:00:38.553 --> 01:00:41.347
(SHOUTING)

01:00:41.431 --> 01:00:43.725
Nothing works!

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.729
This is hopeless!

01:00:48.354 --> 01:00:49.897
HONG: <i>Brother has locked himself away.</i>

01:00:50.356 --> 01:00:53.234
Things are falling apart here.

01:00:54.610 --> 01:01:00.199
(SIGHS) You'll be fine.
I've brought some money to tide you over.

01:01:03.578 --> 01:01:06.080
Don't worry. I'm almost fully recovered.

01:01:06.414 --> 01:01:08.708
Soon, I'll be able to find a job.

01:01:08.916 --> 01:01:10.752
I can't depend on a woman to support me.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.253
OFFICER: Is Master Wong in?

01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:25.892
Is Master Wong in?

01:01:26.601 --> 01:01:29.437
The General wants to see him right away.

01:01:31.272 --> 01:01:35.651
I'm sorry. Master Wong is busy.
He isn't receiving guests.

01:01:36.778 --> 01:01:38.905
He won't even see the General?

01:01:43.451 --> 01:01:44.786
He's not going to see anyone.

01:01:45.453 --> 01:01:47.663
Is he hiding or did he run away?

01:01:48.998 --> 01:01:51.459
We'll take his son as hostage, then.
Grab the boy.

01:01:52.502 --> 01:01:53.753
(WHIMPERS) Fei-Hung!

01:01:56.506 --> 01:01:58.800
- Let's go.
- WONG: <i>Stop!</i>

01:02:28.788 --> 01:02:30.206
I'll go with you.

01:02:48.683 --> 01:02:53.479
You've taken loads of opium paste from me.

01:02:54.564 --> 01:02:56.357
Have you managed to refine it?

01:02:56.816 --> 01:02:57.859
General,

01:02:58.651 --> 01:03:01.863
the process is more difficult
than I expected.

01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:04.907
I need more time to work on it.

01:03:07.201 --> 01:03:08.202
Master Wong,

01:03:09.036 --> 01:03:10.830
I am running out of patience.

01:03:11.205 --> 01:03:12.415
You have to work faster.

01:03:16.544 --> 01:03:20.756
General, I will go home
and work on it immediately.

01:03:25.553 --> 01:03:27.472
(GROANS)

01:03:33.895 --> 01:03:35.897
OFFICER: Looks like he smoked opium.

01:03:36.105 --> 01:03:40.776
Follow him
and check if he is really addicted.

01:03:41.444 --> 01:03:42.528
Yes, General.

01:03:51.204 --> 01:03:52.580
(GROANING)

01:04:11.849 --> 01:04:13.017
(CRIES OUT)

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:15.937
Kei-Ying, aren't you developing
a cure for opium addicts?

01:04:16.103 --> 01:04:17.813
Why are you smoking opium then?

01:04:18.064 --> 01:04:20.983
I'm useless! It's my fault!

01:04:21.734 --> 01:04:24.820
My teacher's health is deteriorating.

01:04:26.239 --> 01:04:31.327
I wanted to pit poison against poison,
but to find the right poisonous herb,

01:04:31.577 --> 01:04:34.956
I need to test each of them
against the opium.

I know you blame yourself for this,
but you have to stop smoking the opium.

You cannot carry on doing this.
Do you understand?
