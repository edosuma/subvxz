01:51.862 --> 01:54.822
May the omnipotent God...

01:54.990 --> 01:59.035
...have mercy upon you,
and forgive you your sins...

01:59.495 --> 02:03.039
...and may Jesus Christ...

02:03.207 --> 02:05.583
...lead you to eternal life.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.043
Amen.

02:10.005 --> 02:13.257
To the faithful people of England...

02:13.425 --> 02:16.010
...your Holy Father offers you...

02:16.178 --> 02:20.556
...the hand of condolence,
his tears of grief...

02:21.099 --> 02:25.895
...and his anger at the martyrdom of
Sir Thomas More and Cardinal Fisher.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.522
Stay back. Stay back.

02:27.689 --> 02:30.900
Their murder has shocked
the whole of Christendom.

02:31.568 --> 02:37.031
It was an unpardonable sin
against God and our Holy Church...

02:37.199 --> 02:42.745
...in whose name these two great
and noble men died.

02:43.247 --> 02:46.082
We pray for those in England...

02:46.250 --> 02:49.919
...who must continue
to live under tyranny...

02:50.087 --> 02:54.423
...and in fear for their lives
and for their souls.

02:54.925 --> 02:59.887
We pray the king ceases to listen
to evil counsel...

03:00.055 --> 03:03.432
...and returns to obedience
and the true faith...

03:04.268 --> 03:06.102
...before it is too late.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.770
Attack the pope.

03:07.938 --> 03:11.232
We pray to Mary, Mother of God...

03:11.400 --> 03:15.570
...that England may be redeemed
from heresy...

03:15.737 --> 03:18.281
...and all its evil ways...

03:18.448 --> 03:21.158
...and from the clutches
of the heretics...

03:21.368 --> 03:24.161
...who even now are leading her...

03:24.371 --> 03:28.291
...towards destruction
and damnation.

03:48.979 --> 03:52.773
George Boleyn, Lord Rochford,
is to marry Lord Morley's daughter.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.484
Yes, Your Majesty.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.153
Lord Morley came to see me.

03:57.988 --> 04:02.700
He cannot meet Sir Thomas Boleyn's
demand for a dowry of £300.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.453
I assured him that l would make up
the shortfall.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.497
Your Majesty is most generous.

04:09.041 --> 04:12.460
How is your survey
of the religious houses progressing?

04:12.961 --> 04:15.463
Majesty, the commissioners
are currently examining...

04:15.631 --> 04:17.506
...houses in the West Country.

04:17.674 --> 04:22.345
There and elsewhere, they tell me
they have uncovered many enormities.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.516
What enormities?

04:27.684 --> 04:32.229
They have found the monks
in many places so depraved...

04:32.439 --> 04:35.858
...so licentious and so corrupt,
that your commissioners...

04:36.026 --> 04:38.361
...already despair
of any perfect reformation.

04:40.072 --> 04:44.033
For example, the case
of the celebrated Holy Blood of Hailes.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.369
Supposedly the blood of a saint...

04:46.536 --> 04:49.872
...used for healing the pilgrims
who flock there hoping for a miracle...

04:50.040 --> 04:55.586
...it turns out to be the blood of a duck,
which the monks renew regularly.

04:58.715 --> 04:59.715
Duck's blood.

05:05.722 --> 05:09.892
Well, Mr. Cromwell, what do you
propose we do about it?

05:10.060 --> 05:13.396
If Your Majesty will forgive me,
I think we should be looking for ways...

05:13.563 --> 05:15.731
...to promote Your Majesty's
new monarchy.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.900
What do you have in mind?

05:18.235 --> 05:21.028
One way would be
through the production of plays.

05:21.196 --> 05:24.073
-Why plays?
-Plays are an ideal way...

05:24.241 --> 05:28.619
...of setting forth the abomination and
wickedness of the bishop of Rome.

05:28.787 --> 05:31.580
They also are means to demonstrate
to people the obedience...

05:31.748 --> 05:35.626
...that as subjects they owe,
by God's and man's laws...

05:35.794 --> 05:37.586
...to Your Majesty.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.255
Good.

05:39.423 --> 05:41.757
Then l leave it to you,
Mr. Secretary...

05:41.925 --> 05:44.719
...to finance and produce
some plays.

05:45.762 --> 05:49.265
We must do all we can
to advance our revolution.

05:57.107 --> 06:01.444
l shall now suffer death
in and for the faith...

06:01.611 --> 06:04.238
...of the Holy Catholic Church.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.291
-My Lord.
-Mr. Secretary.

06:15.459 --> 06:17.126
Your Grace.

06:18.086 --> 06:21.422
Since Your Lordship makes no secret
of your zeal for reform...

06:21.590 --> 06:24.467
...we were anxious to let you know
of our progress.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.636
His Grace has just informed me
of an important new appointment...

06:27.804 --> 06:29.847
-...at Canterbury Cathedral.
-lndeed.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.516
Dr. Simon Heyes has been made
our new dean.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.894
Dr. Heyes detests
the cult of images...

06:35.062 --> 06:37.688
...and is determined to remove them
from the cathedral...

06:37.856 --> 06:39.815
...as well as introducing
the new learning.

06:39.983 --> 06:43.444
It is vital that we place reformers
in positions of responsibility...

06:43.612 --> 06:45.154
...inside the church.

06:45.322 --> 06:48.324
There's bound to be a reaction
to the self-serving martyrdoms...

06:48.492 --> 06:49.950
...of Fisher and More.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.329
Which is why l'm letting it be known
that if anyone hears a friend...

06:53.497 --> 06:57.500
...or a neighbour criticising the king
or his marriage or the reforms...

06:57.667 --> 06:59.502
...they have a duty to report it.

07:00.337 --> 07:05.841
At the same time, Mr. Cromwell, we
have a duty to spread the good news.

07:06.009 --> 07:09.678
If the new monarchy is about
anything at all, it is about liberty.

07:09.846 --> 07:13.349
Liberty from old superstitions,
from fear and guilt.

07:13.517 --> 07:16.852
We-- We are moving, my friends,
from the darkness into the light.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.688
I'm in agreement with Your Grace.

07:20.148 --> 07:23.192
Fortunately,
we have a new weapon...

07:23.360 --> 07:26.153
...to promote our ideas.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.544
Oh, my Lord.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.504
What in God's name is that?

07:48.051 --> 07:51.345
It's called a printing press, My Lord.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.931
Beautiful.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.560
And it will change the world.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.239
What are you thinking of?

08:12.075 --> 08:13.242
Nothing.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.713
May I say something?

08:26.756 --> 08:28.924
You know there are
many people abroad...

08:29.092 --> 08:32.219
...and perhaps even some
within this kingdom...

08:32.387 --> 08:35.764
...who still question
the legitimacy of our daughter.

08:37.184 --> 08:40.102
It's true. You know it's true.

08:42.689 --> 08:45.441
But there is something we can do
to change everything.

08:47.277 --> 08:48.777
If Elizabeth was betrothed...

08:48.945 --> 08:53.073
...to King Francis's youngest son,
the Duke of Angoulême...

08:53.241 --> 08:54.950
...then her legitimacy and station...

08:55.118 --> 08:57.953
...would no longer be questioned
by anyone.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.831
I agree.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.459
And have already thought about it.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.128
I will speak
to the French ambassador.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.472
Will you come to my bed tonight?

09:34.157 --> 09:35.658
Dear Thomas.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.159
Majesty.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.203
Come stay at court.
I need you.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.788
I'm not going to sign it.

09:40.956 --> 09:43.207
You want the world to know
the king is changeable?

09:43.375 --> 09:45.167
--whether it is better
for a king to be feared...

09:45.335 --> 09:47.002
-l don't want to be chancellor.
-...or loved.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.671
You will do as I command.

09:51.675 --> 09:52.675
Harry. Harry.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.343
I come to offer my resignation.

09:54.511 --> 09:55.844
The time for Harry is over.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.847
I discharge you. Most willingly.

09:59.015 --> 10:03.811
--your head. Cut off your body
to be divided in four parts.

10:03.979 --> 10:05.354
Please forgive me.

10:05.981 --> 10:07.356
Harry.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.060
Thomas?

11:01.578 --> 11:03.412
Thomas.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.754
-And you're doing well, yes?
-Yes.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.715
What is it?

11:16.760 --> 11:18.260
I've changed my mind.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.848
I don't want to go through with it.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.059
Here now, sweetheart.

11:25.226 --> 11:28.312
Every woman has a moment
of faintheartedness.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.105
It's natural.

11:31.066 --> 11:32.775
No.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.280
You are marrying
into a great family.

11:38.448 --> 11:41.909
You will do it whether you like it or not.
Do you understand?

12:13.525 --> 12:15.317
Get on with it.

12:15.985 --> 12:18.987
-Amen.
-Amen.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.490
Brethren...

12:21.658 --> 12:23.325
...we are gathered here today.

12:27.789 --> 12:30.958
Majesty, Sir Henry Norris.

12:31.126 --> 12:33.001
Sir Henry.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.337
-Your Majesty.
-What can l do for you?

12:37.298 --> 12:40.300
Well, as Your Majesty may know,
I recently became a widower.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.971
And so naturally,
I'm looking to wed again.

12:44.848 --> 12:48.809
And my choice has fallen upon
one of Her Majesty's ladies.

12:49.644 --> 12:50.686
Who?

12:51.688 --> 12:52.980
Lady Margaret Sheldon.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.692
You mean Madge.

12:56.860 --> 12:57.985
Yes.

12:58.862 --> 13:02.197
Yes, l believe some people call her
that if they are familiar with her.

13:03.867 --> 13:07.035
Have you made your intentions plain
to Miss Sheldon, Sir Henry?

13:07.203 --> 13:12.207
No, Your Majesty. l have merely
admired her from a distance.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.501
But l would now
like to take things further...

13:14.669 --> 13:18.714
...if Your Majesty can think
of no impediment.

13:18.882 --> 13:23.051
No. None. You have my permission.

13:24.179 --> 13:25.846
I've known you a long time.

13:26.014 --> 13:29.516
I could not think of a more honest,
nor more honourable man.

13:29.684 --> 13:32.060
I am deeply grateful
to Your Majesty.

13:33.396 --> 13:34.855
-Sir Henry.
-Your Majesty.

13:44.073 --> 13:47.784
His Excellency
the French ambassador.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.708
-Excellency.
-Your Majesty wanted to see me?

13:54.876 --> 13:58.378
I wanted to ask after my brother,
the king.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.255
His Majesty is very well.

14:00.423 --> 14:03.091
Except for his hatred
of the emperor...

14:03.718 --> 14:05.093
...which is like a disease.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.929
So he still wants our friendship?

14:07.305 --> 14:11.433
Mon Dieu, he loves you above all
the princes in the world.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.063
Then make to him this proposal.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.066
That his son Charles...

14:19.234 --> 14:21.777
...Duke of Angoulême,
should be betrothed...

14:21.945 --> 14:25.239
...to our beloved daughter,
Elizabeth.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.305
Who is she?

14:50.473 --> 14:53.642
Jane Parker.
Lord Morley's daughter.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.646
He's a distant cousin of the king's.

14:57.814 --> 14:58.981
Oh, she's a girl.

15:02.652 --> 15:06.321
-Was that funny?
-l don't know.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.499
Sweetheart.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.335
You do love me, don't you, George?

15:20.503 --> 15:22.504
Of course I love you.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.339
I married you, didn't l?

15:27.844 --> 15:29.469
Oh, l can't wait for tonight.

15:46.696 --> 15:47.821
What is it?

15:47.989 --> 15:49.615
Nothing, I--

15:51.034 --> 15:53.035
Excuse me, Father.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.831
You're very pretty.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.128
Pretty Jane.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.756
Pretty, pretty.

17:53.114 --> 17:55.991
No.

17:56.159 --> 17:59.995
No, please.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.247
Please, no.

18:04.876 --> 18:08.628
No.

19:22.203 --> 19:25.413
Let us go about our other matters.

19:25.581 --> 19:31.086
Now, as much as King John does
Holy Church so handle...

19:31.254 --> 19:33.630
...so here l curse him...

19:33.840 --> 19:39.427
...with cross, book, bell and candle.

19:43.432 --> 19:48.436
I will ask God to put him
from his eternal light.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.273
I will take him from Christ.

19:51.440 --> 19:55.110
And after the sound of this bell....

19:56.279 --> 19:59.948
The bell, you buggers. The bell.

20:01.409 --> 20:04.119
And after the sound of this bell....

20:06.414 --> 20:11.251
I said, after the sound of this bell...

20:11.419 --> 20:17.591
...both body and soul,
I will give him to the devil in hell.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.140
And meanwhile--

20:25.308 --> 20:28.143
This is a fine piece of work,
Mr. Secretary.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.145
And educative.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.148
I wonder who wrote it.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.525
Mr. Bale.

20:35.985 --> 20:40.155
He was once a priest of the old faith,
but seeing how things went on...

20:40.323 --> 20:42.657
...became a most passionate
reformer.

20:44.327 --> 20:47.287
You know, I think our family
never did anything better...

20:47.455 --> 20:51.666
...than facilitate and encourage
your own rise, Mr. Secretary.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.338
I trust you never forget
that we did so.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.299
And all the abbots and bishops...

20:59.467 --> 21:05.013
...will make lots and lots of money.

21:09.352 --> 21:12.729
I love the pope
as much as ever may be.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.523
I prithee heartily,
tell me why you do so?

21:15.691 --> 21:19.527
Because I perceive well
the pope is a jolly fellow.

21:19.695 --> 21:25.533
A trim fellow. A rich fellow.
Yes, and a merry fellow.

21:25.701 --> 21:32.040
He's rich in his royalty
and angelic in his behold.

21:43.344 --> 21:46.012
-l've talked to the French ambassador.
-Come here, fellow.

21:46.180 --> 21:49.891
Francis is sending the admiral
of France to arrange the marriage.

21:50.351 --> 21:53.395
-Thank you.
-His name is Treason, Your Majesty.

21:53.562 --> 21:57.232
Let us hear something
on behalf of the old church.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.234
Gilded images, all.

21:59.402 --> 22:01.403
-ln your necessities....
-Majesties.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.905
The admiral of France
is to pay an official visit.

22:04.573 --> 22:08.243
I want you to receive
and entertain him on my behalf.

22:08.911 --> 22:12.205
-Why him?
-All the more procession....

22:12.915 --> 22:14.749
-ln fasting and--
-Surely my father...

22:14.917 --> 22:16.918
...would be a much better choice.

22:17.420 --> 22:19.587
-Pestilence and the--
-l trust Your Grace...

22:19.755 --> 22:21.089
...to carry out my commands.

22:22.216 --> 22:24.884
I am, as ever...

22:25.052 --> 22:27.595
...Your Majesty's
humble and obedient servant.

22:29.432 --> 22:32.767
And what is there of Christ
in your church, pray tell?

22:32.935 --> 22:35.603
That was unnecessary.

22:36.230 --> 22:39.274
-He hates me.
-But he loves me.

22:39.442 --> 22:42.152
And as they're in Latin...

22:42.319 --> 22:45.113
...no man can know.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.660
-What is it?
-That woman is a whore.

22:50.828 --> 22:53.788
She treats me worse
than l treat my dogs.

22:54.165 --> 22:56.624
But then your dogs bite back.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.795
If ceremonies and superstitions
from us fall...

23:00.963 --> 23:07.302
...then farewell monks and canons,
priest, friar, bishop and all.

23:16.937 --> 23:19.064
Your Majesties.

23:20.191 --> 23:22.358
How is Queen Catherine?

23:22.777 --> 23:24.194
Alas, she is very unwell.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.488
That the king may continue
to reign over her.

23:26.655 --> 23:27.989
She is sinking.

23:28.616 --> 23:30.992
Not only is her household
severely reduced...

23:31.160 --> 23:34.996
...but she has been separated from
her daughter for the last four years.

23:35.164 --> 23:36.623
That is very cruel.

23:36.791 --> 23:38.541
But her faith is astonishing.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.710
And that his offspring may reign too.

23:40.878 --> 23:42.378
And the Lady Mary?

23:42.588 --> 23:45.006
-lt's up to the--
-While the concubine has power...

23:45.174 --> 23:49.594
-...I fear for her life.
-To the comfort of this nation.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.213
Lady Mary, what in heaven's name
are you doing...

25:07.381 --> 25:09.591
...with the Princess Elizabeth?

25:10.050 --> 25:12.093
She was left alone.

25:12.761 --> 25:14.721
I took care of her.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.767
Give her to me.

25:32.072 --> 25:35.283
You left her alone, you little fool.

25:41.457 --> 25:44.292
Then we sup and think of those
who are no longer with us.

25:44.460 --> 25:47.420
To More and to Fisher,
those martyred men.

25:48.297 --> 25:49.464
God bless them.

25:56.597 --> 26:00.141
I am told that many who
initially supported the king's reforms...

26:00.309 --> 26:03.144
...are now forming
a different opinion.

26:03.812 --> 26:07.607
The terrible murder of honest and
faithful men has opened many eyes.

26:09.318 --> 26:11.486
I still do not blame the king.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.323
He's been seduced by witchcraft.

26:15.491 --> 26:16.783
I have always believed it.

26:16.951 --> 26:18.159
And now I have proof.

26:18.327 --> 26:20.286
-You have proof?
-Yes.

26:20.955 --> 26:26.125
I have befriended a maid
of Anne's bedchamber...

26:26.794 --> 26:29.170
...who has told me that the harlot
hides a secret.

26:31.757 --> 26:34.008
She's deformed, Chapuys.

26:34.677 --> 26:38.471
An extra fingernail on her left hand
which she is at great pains to conceal.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.516
As well, her body?

26:42.017 --> 26:44.560
It's covered in moles,
which is sometimes called...

26:44.770 --> 26:46.354
...the Devil's teats, as you know.

26:46.522 --> 26:50.024
Now, this maid swore to me honestly
that she had seen these quite plainly...

26:50.192 --> 26:52.151
...on Anne's naked skin.

26:52.319 --> 26:55.154
Even though the lady constantly seeks
to cover herself.

26:56.198 --> 26:57.907
My God.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.367
Is it so?

26:59.535 --> 27:01.869
It is the truth.

27:05.874 --> 27:08.001
That is why she must die.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.085
What is it?

27:52.921 --> 27:54.756
He's having more affairs.

27:55.758 --> 27:57.550
Are you sure?

27:57.718 --> 27:59.761
Of course I'm sure.

27:59.928 --> 28:02.096
Often l can't find him.

28:02.264 --> 28:03.765
No one will tell me where he is.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.267
He leaves the palace, I know that.

28:06.977 --> 28:10.229
He's gone for hours sometimes.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.776
I think he's got a harem somewhere.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.944
There's a place
where he keeps his harem.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.946
Where he keeps his women.
I know it.

28:19.114 --> 28:21.115
Anne.

28:26.497 --> 28:29.290
Something's going to happen to me.

28:29.458 --> 28:30.875
No.

28:31.168 --> 28:33.961
You know there's a prophecy.
Everyone knows it.

28:34.129 --> 28:39.634
The prophecy says
a queen of England will be burned.

28:39.802 --> 28:41.469
Don't talk like this.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.471
Nothing's going to happen to you.

28:43.639 --> 28:47.141
I'm unable to give a king a son.

28:47.309 --> 28:49.143
A son.

28:49.645 --> 28:52.605
To be the living image of his father.

28:54.650 --> 28:57.652
It's all right.
Everything's going to be all right.

28:58.153 --> 28:59.654
Please don't cry.

29:00.447 --> 29:02.115
I love you.

29:03.325 --> 29:05.493
I'll look after you, l swear.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.788
Please don't cry.

29:22.845 --> 29:25.346
-Sir Thomas.
-Mr. Secretary.

29:26.223 --> 29:27.849
What are all these?

29:28.350 --> 29:29.851
Denunciations.

29:30.853 --> 29:32.854
It is reported that a canon
at Tewkesbury...

29:33.021 --> 29:36.732
...mistakenly or otherwise, offered
prayers to Catherine the Queen...

29:36.942 --> 29:38.025
...rather than Anne.

29:39.194 --> 29:42.196
Seven of his congregation
reported these words.

29:44.575 --> 29:45.700
What will you do to him?

29:46.452 --> 29:48.202
Nothing.

29:48.370 --> 29:50.037
He's near 80 years old.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.540
Absent-minded slip
of the tongue. Such an old man.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.667
It's perfectly forgivable.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.170
Some of these others...

29:58.088 --> 30:00.006
...are much more serious.

30:06.847 --> 30:08.389
Have a look at these.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.394
They're tracts praising
His Majesty...

30:13.562 --> 30:15.897
...and his new monarchy
and the reformation.

30:16.064 --> 30:20.193
They explain why the reformation
is necessary.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.570
The liberties
and opportunities it will bring...

30:22.738 --> 30:25.573
...even to the king's
humblest subjects.

30:25.741 --> 30:27.867
These are very impressive.

30:28.076 --> 30:31.913
You are to be congratulated
on your industry, Mr. Secretary.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.751
But does it never concern you...

30:37.044 --> 30:41.130
...that the king has taken to himself
an absolute power...

30:41.298 --> 30:43.925
...without any constraint
to remake the law?

30:46.303 --> 30:49.597
Is not that which pleases the king...

30:49.765 --> 30:51.432
...the law?

30:54.102 --> 30:55.811
I was--

30:56.313 --> 30:58.648
-l was only observing.
-l like you, Mr. Wyatt.

30:58.815 --> 31:03.945
I enjoy your company,
but you have a reputation you gamble.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.614
And you whore.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.616
You sail close to the wind.

31:10.160 --> 31:13.955
God forbid it should ever
blow you onto the rocks.

31:26.301 --> 31:28.469
His Excellency
Philippe Chabot de Brion...

31:28.637 --> 31:30.263
...Admiral of France.

31:30.430 --> 31:31.472
Your Grace.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.976
Admiral Chabot. lt is my privilege
and pleasure to welcome you...

31:35.143 --> 31:37.979
...and you party
to my home and to England.

31:38.146 --> 31:39.814
May I present my wife, the duchess.

31:40.482 --> 31:41.649
Madam.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.693
I am delighted to meet you.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.655
And, with your permission,
may I present my secretary...

31:47.823 --> 31:50.324
-...Monsieur Alfonse Gontier.
-Madam.

31:50.492 --> 31:52.159
-Your Grace.
-And my niece.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.995
Mademoiselle Germaine.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.163
Mademoiselle, you are very pretty.

31:56.832 --> 31:58.457
Madam.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.334
Your Grace.

32:03.630 --> 32:07.008
So tell me, Your Grace,
what are we to expect?

32:07.175 --> 32:10.636
I am to entertain you and your staff.
Then the king invites you to dine.

32:10.804 --> 32:14.181
-Very good.
-There is one other thing.

32:15.017 --> 32:19.020
I am told that Queen Anne
has planned a banquet in your honour.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.314
And a tennis match.

32:25.902 --> 32:30.072
I believe you met Her Majesty
once before, in Calais...

32:30.240 --> 32:33.492
...when she accompanied His Majesty
before her coronation?

32:34.328 --> 32:38.080
I may have. But I have no recollection
of any such meeting.

32:38.248 --> 32:42.001
And, alas, I don't play tennis.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.047
Shall we?

32:50.218 --> 32:52.428
-Majesty.
-Good morrow, John.

32:52.638 --> 32:53.721
Majesty.

32:57.392 --> 32:58.726
-Where are you going?
-Out.

32:58.894 --> 33:01.896
-Where?
-Go back inside.

33:04.691 --> 33:06.734
Where are you going?
I want to know.

33:06.902 --> 33:10.237
It is none of your business. lt is my
pleasure you go back inside now.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.240
Majesty.

33:20.415 --> 33:21.916
-Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

33:22.084 --> 33:23.417
Your Majesty.

33:23.585 --> 33:24.794
Majesty.

33:24.961 --> 33:27.755
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

33:39.226 --> 33:40.267
Whore.

34:58.013 --> 34:59.013
Mademoiselle?

35:29.044 --> 35:30.669
I like you, Excellency.

35:31.379 --> 35:33.214
You're very clever.

35:34.007 --> 35:37.009
But l don't like the way
your emperor treats me.

35:37.552 --> 35:41.347
He seems to thinks as far as Catherine
is concerned, that I act out of spite.

35:41.515 --> 35:44.725
Or that I'm being malicious.

35:44.893 --> 35:47.228
But l swear it's not true.

35:47.938 --> 35:50.564
I suppose I ought to be content
that the world knows...

35:50.732 --> 35:53.400
...the many wrongs
that have been done to me.

35:58.114 --> 36:01.408
You don't approve of the changes
I'm making in this kingdom.

36:02.744 --> 36:06.580
Cromwell intercepts some
of your letters.

36:07.707 --> 36:10.709
We used to call it humanism,
Wolsey, More and me.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.588
We were all humanists.

36:14.756 --> 36:17.758
Most people think I've changed,
but I haven't.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.760
At heart, l'm still a humanist.

36:21.096 --> 36:22.930
Chapuys.

36:25.058 --> 36:26.725
I promise you...

36:26.893 --> 36:30.229
...that l am going to make
such a reformation in this kingdom...

36:30.397 --> 36:35.067
...that l shall be remembered eternally,
throughout all Christendom.

36:37.779 --> 36:41.782
I have no doubt whatsoever
that Your Majesty's reign...

36:41.950 --> 36:44.785
...will always be remembered.

36:53.795 --> 36:56.088
I had planned a banquet
in his honour.

36:56.256 --> 36:58.507
-Who?
-The French admiral.

36:58.675 --> 37:02.011
He has been here for two weeks
already with the Duke of Suffolk...

37:02.178 --> 37:05.097
...and he has not yet sent me
a message of goodwill.

37:05.265 --> 37:08.601
Every other French envoy
has always done so.

37:08.768 --> 37:11.312
Neither has he requested
an audience with me.

37:11.479 --> 37:13.981
With me, the queen of England.

37:14.774 --> 37:18.485
And when we are discussing the future
of my own child.

37:18.653 --> 37:21.322
Your Majesty should rest.
I ought to leave you.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.782
They tell me he has struck
up an acquaintance...

37:23.950 --> 37:25.826
...with the Imperial Ambassador,
Chapuys.

37:26.661 --> 37:28.162
Is that not extraordinary?

37:28.330 --> 37:31.457
Tell me, why should he do
such a thing?

37:36.838 --> 37:38.839
Why do you not say anything,
Mark?

37:39.007 --> 37:41.842
Your Majesty must forgive me.
I don't know what to say.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.511
These matters are beyond
my competence.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.388
What am I?
I'm only a dancing master.

37:46.556 --> 37:48.682
And then there's something else.

37:48.850 --> 37:51.310
Someone, some bitch
who probably hates me...

37:51.478 --> 37:53.437
...told me the king
deliberately invited...

37:53.605 --> 37:57.358
...a lot of beautiful women to court
for the admiral's visit.

37:58.151 --> 38:00.653
I mean, can you believe that?

38:14.042 --> 38:17.044
-Your Grace.
-Your Majesty.

38:17.212 --> 38:18.921
May I present His Excellency...

38:19.089 --> 38:23.050
...Philippe Chabot de Brion,
the Admiral of France.

38:23.385 --> 38:24.385
Majesty.

38:24.552 --> 38:26.720
Welcome to my court.

38:26.888 --> 38:30.224
Allow me to introduce my wife,
Queen Anne.

38:31.226 --> 38:32.851
Madam.

38:37.607 --> 38:40.734
Please, let us be seated.

39:12.934 --> 39:14.768
-Some wine?
-Of course.

39:14.936 --> 39:17.771
Which domain does it come from?
Is it Bordeaux?

39:18.398 --> 39:19.606
This is English wine.

39:19.774 --> 39:21.233
English wine?

39:22.277 --> 39:24.778
We have been making wine
in England since the Romans.

39:24.946 --> 39:26.572
As recently as that?

39:36.791 --> 39:40.127
It's very fruity.

39:43.840 --> 39:46.300
And strong like...

39:46.468 --> 39:48.761
...a gladiator's sweat.

40:12.827 --> 40:14.328
Who is that gentleman?

40:15.288 --> 40:17.664
My secretary, Monsieur Gontier.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.376
I should like to introduce him
to my wife.

40:21.586 --> 40:22.628
Excuse me.

40:36.351 --> 40:38.018
Majesty.

40:41.689 --> 40:44.024
Your Majesty must forgive me...

40:44.192 --> 40:47.194
...for not being able to attend
the banquet you arranged.

40:47.362 --> 40:49.863
It was most unfortunate...

40:50.031 --> 40:53.367
...but His Grace, the Duke of Suffolk,
and his charming wife...

40:53.535 --> 40:56.537
...have kept me a virtual prisoner
in their castle.

40:56.746 --> 40:59.039
I was-- How shall l say?

41:00.875 --> 41:02.376
--imprisoned by affection.

41:05.547 --> 41:08.549
Madam? Are you amusing yourself
at my expense?

41:10.718 --> 41:13.220
Forgive me, monsieur.

41:13.805 --> 41:16.223
I couldn't help laughing
at the king's proposition...

41:16.391 --> 41:18.725
...of introducing
your secretary to me.

41:19.394 --> 41:24.064
For, whilst he was finding him,
he met that pretty lady...

41:24.232 --> 41:25.858
...and forgot the whole thing.

41:29.904 --> 41:32.239
Let's talk some business.

42:10.904 --> 42:13.780
What instructions do you have
with regards to the betrothal...

42:13.948 --> 42:17.284
...of my daughter Elizabeth
to the Duke of Angoulême?

42:19.287 --> 42:22.915
His Majesty regrets
that such a proposition is impossible.

42:23.082 --> 42:24.958
Why impossible?

42:25.126 --> 42:28.253
Much as he loves Your Majesty,
the king cannot agree to betroth...

42:28.421 --> 42:30.839
...his beloved son to a--

42:31.007 --> 42:33.800
To a bride whose legitimacy
is not accepted...

42:33.968 --> 42:35.469
...by His Holiness Pope Paul.

42:36.804 --> 42:38.972
By Holy Church itself.

42:39.599 --> 42:41.475
Nor even by the emperor.

42:43.728 --> 42:46.146
However, His Majesty...

42:46.314 --> 42:49.483
...to demonstrate his love,
proposes another match.

42:51.110 --> 42:55.781
He would consent to the betrothal
of the dauphin to Lady Mary...

42:55.949 --> 42:58.325
...your legitimate daughter.

43:02.497 --> 43:04.206
If you do not agree to the match...

43:04.374 --> 43:07.167
...my master will marry his son
to the emperor's daughter...

43:08.378 --> 43:11.838
...leaving your country
isolated in Europe.

43:19.639 --> 43:23.350
Excellence, your audience
with His Majesty is now over.

43:48.209 --> 43:49.876
I'm sorry.

43:52.046 --> 43:54.381
I have no excuses, Catherine.

43:55.008 --> 43:57.301
I thought those days
were behind me.

43:58.886 --> 44:01.388
Perhaps human nature
can never change.

44:03.891 --> 44:06.059
I swear to you
it will never happen again.

44:06.561 --> 44:08.562
I love you too much.

44:08.938 --> 44:12.232
I have no right to ask you
to believe me.

44:15.236 --> 44:17.029
But it's true.

44:20.908 --> 44:22.451
You see?

44:23.328 --> 44:25.579
You did make me cry after all.

45:00.406 --> 45:02.157
Who was she?

45:02.575 --> 45:04.117
Who was who?

45:04.786 --> 45:06.286
That lady you were talking to...

45:06.454 --> 45:09.623
...when you were supposed
to be finding Monsieur Gontier.

45:13.419 --> 45:16.129
-l don't know.
-ls she one of your mistresses?

45:32.146 --> 45:33.772
How many do you have?

45:35.608 --> 45:37.484
What are their names?

45:38.820 --> 45:40.821
Where do you keep them?

45:41.656 --> 45:43.657
Someone told me your nobles,
like Brandon...

45:43.825 --> 45:46.159
...are assisting you
in having your affairs.

45:46.327 --> 45:48.161
That's enough.

45:49.122 --> 45:50.664
No.

45:51.791 --> 45:52.833
No, you told me.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.670
You always told me that we should
be truthful with each other.

45:56.838 --> 45:59.131
You said
it was the definition of love.

45:59.298 --> 46:01.341
Then here's the truth.

46:01.676 --> 46:04.845
You must shut your eyes
and endure.

46:05.012 --> 46:07.347
Like your betters have done
before you.

46:07.849 --> 46:10.725
How can you say that to me?

46:11.519 --> 46:15.814
Don't you know l love you a thousand
times more than Catherine ever did?

46:15.982 --> 46:19.860
And don't you know that l can drag
you down as quickly as l raised you?

46:21.237 --> 46:23.655
'Tis lucky you have your bed
already, madam.

46:23.865 --> 46:27.534
Because if you did not,
I would not give it to you again.

46:30.329 --> 46:32.372
Francis won't accept the betrothal.

46:33.374 --> 46:35.167
-Why?
-Why do you think?

46:36.043 --> 46:40.881
Because the pope and he
and the emperor all agree...

46:41.048 --> 46:42.674
...she is a bastard.

46:42.842 --> 46:45.760
And you are not my wife.

47:12.121 --> 47:14.748
Tell me, how's your Catherine?

47:17.043 --> 47:18.752
She's fine.

47:20.588 --> 47:23.089
In fact, she's with child.

47:23.758 --> 47:28.094
You're a happily married man,
Charles. I envy you.

47:29.931 --> 47:33.266
Do you think the planets
have any influence over our lives?

47:33.601 --> 47:34.726
I don't know.

47:36.270 --> 47:39.105
I would often discuss the issue
with More.

47:39.732 --> 47:41.441
We would stand on the roof
at night...

47:42.443 --> 47:44.819
...and study the heavens.

47:47.615 --> 47:50.450
More had a great knowledge
of the stars...

47:50.618 --> 47:53.036
...and how they influence our...

47:54.747 --> 47:55.956
...humours.

48:06.133 --> 48:08.927
I regret now
what happened to More.

48:12.640 --> 48:15.642
In some ways,
I wish it never happened.

48:18.980 --> 48:21.481
But it wasn't all my fault.

48:22.858 --> 48:26.069
Whenever my resolve weakened...

48:26.654 --> 48:29.489
...whenever I was inclined
to save him...

48:30.658 --> 48:35.579
...a certain person would privately
urge me on to his destruction.

48:40.501 --> 48:41.668
Who?

48:43.963 --> 48:46.840
You know who she is, Charles.
