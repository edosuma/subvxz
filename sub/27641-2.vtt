WEBVTT

00:02.192 --> 00:04.232
This programme contains strong
language and adult humour.

00:04.232 --> 00:05.569
Not here. We can do that in the car.

00:05.569 --> 00:07.169
I took the bus.
We can do it on the bus.

00:07.169 --> 00:09.992
Slut!
SHE LAUGHS

00:09.992 --> 00:12.632
What time's your sister getting in?
Not until eight.

00:12.632 --> 00:14.552
Oh, can't wait to see her.

00:14.552 --> 00:17.912
She's bringing me over
some Diazepam.

00:17.912 --> 00:19.969
Happy pills.
Yeah, I know what it is.

00:19.969 --> 00:22.049
Why do you take that shit?Dunno.

00:22.049 --> 00:25.112
Just sometimes like to feel a bit
better than my factory settings.

00:25.112 --> 00:27.872
THEY LAUGH
What's the new foster kid like?

00:27.872 --> 00:31.592
I dunno. I know he's a teen.Really?

00:31.592 --> 00:33.889
Bloody hell! Good for her.

00:33.889 --> 00:35.672
When Frankie and Muireann are older,

00:35.672 --> 00:37.889
we should think about
fostering some kids.

00:37.889 --> 00:40.712
Are you mental?
Why would we wanna do that?

00:40.712 --> 00:44.312
Cos it's a good thing to do.
We don't have time to do good stuff!

00:44.312 --> 00:46.952
Or space.Well, just say
you don't wanna do it.

00:46.952 --> 00:49.249
Don't say we don't have enough space.

00:49.249 --> 00:51.992
Those kids come from clusters,
hives of kids.

00:51.992 --> 00:55.352
They don't give a shit about space.
Give 'em an apple and a blanket

00:55.352 --> 00:57.512
and they think they're
at Disney World.

00:57.512 --> 00:59.969
Oh, did I tell you
she's a Quaker now?Huh?

00:59.969 --> 01:02.552
Yeah. She started checking it out
after Colton left her.

01:02.552 --> 01:04.832
Now she's full-bore.Really?

01:04.832 --> 01:08.792
God, that worries me. Your sister's
ripe for being taken advantage of

01:08.792 --> 01:12.152
by a cult.It's not a cult.
Plus, they're hypocrites.

01:12.152 --> 01:14.912
You know, "I won't use a BlackBerry,
    but I will use a wheel."

01:14.912 --> 01:18.049
A wheel's technology.
They use wheels like crazy.

01:18.049 --> 01:20.912
They're fucking nuts about wheels.
And barns.

01:20.912 --> 01:23.809
Barn technology. Also, that's Amish.

01:23.809 --> 01:26.552
Hang on. How did she even get
over here, if she's a Quaker?

01:26.552 --> 01:28.592
I mean, how is she allowed
to use a plane?

01:28.592 --> 01:31.169
She should come in a covered wagon.
That's Amish.

01:31.169 --> 01:33.512
It's a different thing.
It's the same thing.

01:33.512 --> 01:36.512
You're a bigot.
So what? What are you gonna do -

01:36.512 --> 01:38.912
text an Amish person?
It's not the same thing,

01:38.912 --> 01:42.049
so your joke doesn't work.Who cares?

01:42.049 --> 01:46.712
My asshole ex drew a swastika
on my passport

01:46.712 --> 01:49.472
so I wouldn't be able to leave
the country.Oh, my God!

01:49.472 --> 01:53.432
The TSA guy said, "That's fine,
so long as they can read the chip."

01:53.432 --> 01:55.592
And then on this side,
the guy just smiled at me

01:55.592 --> 01:59.969
and invited me
to something called a...a ooh-kip.

01:59.969 --> 02:02.432
Colton thinks that
if he makes my life miserable,

02:02.432 --> 02:05.249
he's gonna feel better.
He's so unhappy.

02:05.249 --> 02:08.672
I'm just praying for him. Did I tell
  you that he took all my money

02:08.672 --> 02:11.489
from the company we started
together? I had to sell the house.

02:11.489 --> 02:13.889
You did, but... Oh, no.

02:13.889 --> 02:16.609
So Mom showed me how to eBay
some of his Bruins jerseys,

02:16.609 --> 02:18.872
and that's how I paid
for the plane tickets.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.752
Oh!What's the bandwidth here?

02:21.752 --> 02:24.769
Huh?How long would it take
to download 75 gigs?

02:24.769 --> 02:28.609
Oh, I don't know.
But we have a full-colour TV.

02:28.609 --> 02:31.832
You can watch a whole show,
right now, as it's happening.

02:31.832 --> 02:35.192
Well, we're gonna get out
from under your feet very soon.

02:35.192 --> 02:38.432
Oh, don't worry about that.
No, I wanna dive right in.

02:38.432 --> 02:40.952
Do you guys wanna go to
Buckingham Palace with us?

02:40.952 --> 02:43.592
Oh, no, thank you.
I don't like the monarchy.

02:43.592 --> 02:45.992
Oh, that's funny, cos I've seen you
looking at pictures

02:45.992 --> 02:49.249
of Princess Beatrice on your phone.
That's not because she's a royal.

02:49.249 --> 02:51.872
She has giant beautiful eyes,

02:51.872 --> 02:54.272
and even if she worked
at Pizza Express,

02:54.272 --> 02:57.409
I'd still look at pictures of her
on my phone.That's not creepy.

02:57.409 --> 02:59.969
And also, do you know how much
the Crown Jewels are worth?

02:59.969 --> 03:02.312
If they sold
just one of those jewels,

03:02.312 --> 03:04.472
it'd fund the NHS for 200 years,

03:04.472 --> 03:06.689
so for that reason,
I hope they all get rickets.

03:06.689 --> 03:11.552
Other than that, they are quite fun.
THEY LAUGH

03:11.552 --> 03:15.169
Morning.Mm. I hope you don't mind
that I helped myself to breakfast.

03:15.169 --> 03:19.232
Oh, God, no. Knock yourself out.
These Weetabix things are hilarious.

03:19.232 --> 03:22.529
They start out as this wheaty brick,
 then you pour some milk on them

03:22.529 --> 03:25.952
and they turn into
this sort of tasty slime.

03:25.952 --> 03:28.232
Yeah! They're fun, all right.

03:28.232 --> 03:31.592
Where's Rob?He's, er, doing
his morning meditation.

03:31.592 --> 03:34.712
Really?No. He's having a shit.Oh.

03:34.712 --> 03:39.392
Between you and me, I came over here
    to check how he's doing.

03:39.392 --> 03:42.392
Mom didn't paint a great picture.
How is he?

03:42.392 --> 03:45.392
How is he? Er...
I don't know, really.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.032
I mean, he's not drinking,
but he's not really happy.

03:48.032 --> 03:51.512
He's sort of ashamed, I guess,
so he's working on himself,

03:51.512 --> 03:54.049
which is great, but also selfish.
Mm-hm.

03:54.049 --> 03:56.449
It's like he's on a crusade,
but to somewhere boring,

03:56.449 --> 03:59.489
and we all have to come.
Doesn't sound very fun for you.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.592
Yeah. I don't need fun ALL the time.

04:01.592 --> 04:05.072
It's just that, up until recently,
his alcoholism was just folklore,

04:05.072 --> 04:08.072
you know?
And now it's kinda in my face.

04:08.072 --> 04:11.552
But, er... Oh! There he is.
Morning!Morning.

04:11.552 --> 04:15.752
Oh, hey, Syd - assuming you get
your fill of touristy stuff today,

04:15.752 --> 04:19.169
do you think you could possibly watch
the kids for us tonight?

04:19.169 --> 04:21.632
Why? What we doing?
You taking me somewhere nice?

04:21.632 --> 04:23.912
There's an open AA meeting
at St Andrew's tonight

04:23.912 --> 04:27.512
that you can bring family to,
so I thought we might hit that.

04:27.512 --> 04:29.552
They usually have
a pretty good biscuit spread

04:29.552 --> 04:34.712
if you get there early enough.
They go pretty fast.

04:34.712 --> 04:37.889
Hey!Morning!Morning.

04:37.889 --> 04:41.249
Would you like to come and see
the opening night of Jeffrey's play?

04:41.249 --> 04:44.672
Late notice because, I'll be honest,
  you weren't my first choice.

04:44.672 --> 04:47.432
Oh, wow! Yeah, I'd love to.
Well, great!

04:47.432 --> 04:50.209
You have to be there at 6:30.
Why? How long's the play?

04:50.209 --> 04:52.472
Three and a half hours.
SHE MOUTHS

04:52.472 --> 04:54.872
I don't think I can make that.

04:54.872 --> 04:56.912
Chris is bringing
his new girlfriend

04:56.912 --> 04:59.192
and I could really do with
the moral support. Please!

04:59.192 --> 05:02.072
Will anyone famous be there?
Benedict Cumberbatch's brother,

05:02.072 --> 05:07.352
Rollo, is playing Sebastian.
Oh, Christ.

05:07.352 --> 05:10.472
Mom said you were a real mess
last time she was over.

05:10.472 --> 05:15.169
How you doing now?I mean, my head's
still a bit of a clown graveyard,

05:15.169 --> 05:17.432
if I'm being honest.
Yeah?But, you know,

05:17.432 --> 05:20.552
don't tell her that.I didn't even
tell her about the accident.

05:20.552 --> 05:22.832
Thank you.
How's she doing, by the way?

05:22.832 --> 05:25.112
Oh, she is just...rough work!

05:25.112 --> 05:28.712
Her hearing's going,
so she shouts at me a lot,

05:28.712 --> 05:31.232
and then I shout at her
just to be heard.

05:31.232 --> 05:33.272
Everybody's just screaming.Ugh!

05:33.272 --> 05:38.432
Is there anything I can do to help?
Well...not from here.

05:38.432 --> 05:40.472
Do you ever think about moving back?

05:40.472 --> 05:43.009
Yeah. I think about it all the time,

05:43.009 --> 05:46.472
but that idea doesn't gain
a lot of purchase with Sharon.

05:46.472 --> 05:49.352
Maybe when she dies.

05:49.352 --> 05:53.432
Why would Sharon die? Is she sick?
Not that I know of.

05:53.432 --> 05:55.712
OK!Oh, hey, Dave called,

05:55.712 --> 05:58.369
and he wants to see you,
so I invited him over for dinner.

05:58.369 --> 06:00.752
I hope that's OK.Dave Norton?Yeah.

06:00.752 --> 06:03.272
Oh, my God. He's still alive?
Shockingly.

06:03.272 --> 06:05.912
Whoa! All right.
We'll see you home for dinner.

06:05.912 --> 06:09.152
We're just gonna pop in here.
Oh, you're quakin' already?

06:09.152 --> 06:11.192
Yeah! Quake on vacation.

06:11.192 --> 06:14.552
OK.

06:14.552 --> 06:16.832
Can I come in?Totally!

06:16.832 --> 06:19.969
Yeah, come on. Let's go.

06:19.969 --> 06:22.849
OK! So, for your homework tonight,

06:22.849 --> 06:26.209
I would like you to use
your spelling words from today

06:26.209 --> 06:28.832
to make a picture, OK?
I want you to all use colours -

06:28.832 --> 06:31.952
that's crayons, colouring pencils,

06:31.952 --> 06:35.432
or just borrow your dad's
bettin' Biro,

06:35.432 --> 06:37.472
and, er...
BELL RINGS

06:37.472 --> 06:39.992
All right, everyone.
Leave your papers on your desk.

06:39.992 --> 06:42.632
Sam? Sam, I want you to stay behind.

06:42.632 --> 06:46.112
OK. Right, no talking! Out!

06:46.112 --> 06:49.352
Thank you. James, Sonny,
stop flossing.

06:49.352 --> 06:51.392
CHILDREN LAUGH

06:51.392 --> 06:53.729
Hey.

06:53.729 --> 06:56.192
Did you have a little accident?
Yeah?

06:56.192 --> 06:58.232
Do you still need to go
to the toilet,

06:58.232 --> 07:01.889
or did you do it all here?

07:01.889 --> 07:05.192
OK. Um, I tell you what -
I will go to lost property,

07:05.192 --> 07:08.192
and see if they've got any spare
trousers, like last time. Yeah?

07:08.192 --> 07:10.712
And don't worry about it. This
kind of thing used to happen to me

07:10.712 --> 07:13.112
all the time. You should hear what
my husband did

07:13.112 --> 07:15.512
at his sister's wedding.

07:15.512 --> 07:26.552
I'll tell you when I get back.
OK. Good man.

07:26.552 --> 07:33.272
What's happening now?
Oh, you just listen.

07:33.272 --> 07:37.352
To what?Whatever's on your mind.

07:37.352 --> 07:42.049
Or God... if you believe
in that crap.

07:42.049 --> 07:58.712
Which I do.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.032
So, Syd,

08:00.032 --> 08:03.752
whatever happened to
that fuckin' asshole... Oh.

08:03.752 --> 08:06.392
I'm sorry, Jamie.Er, Jimmy.

08:06.392 --> 08:09.752
Oh! Sorry about that, too.
HE LAUGHS

08:09.752 --> 08:13.112
Syd, whatever happened
to that fuckin'... SHIT!

08:13.112 --> 08:17.569
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Er... What
do I do, give them money, or...?

08:17.569 --> 08:20.609
No. Just next time you think
you're gonna swear, don't.

08:20.609 --> 08:23.809
OK. Sure. Syd...Yes?

08:23.809 --> 08:26.792
..whatever happened
to that...person...

08:26.792 --> 08:30.872
you used to be in
an adult relationship with?

08:30.872 --> 08:34.592
You know, that angry guy
with the greasy face?

08:34.592 --> 08:36.872
Mm-hm. Colton?Yeah.I married him.

08:36.872 --> 08:39.169
Stayed with him
for a little over a decade,

08:39.169 --> 08:41.792
and still detangling myself
from that wreckage.

08:41.792 --> 08:43.832
HE LAUGHS

08:43.832 --> 08:48.272
I just never thought I would see
Dave Norton strapped to a baby!

08:48.272 --> 08:50.209
HE LAUGHS
I know, right?

08:50.209 --> 08:51.809
Yeah!

08:51.809 --> 08:54.529
Oh, I am so blessed.

08:54.529 --> 08:56.792
I'm sorry her mom couldn't be here.

08:56.792 --> 08:59.672
She's got a little dose
of the baby blues,

08:59.672 --> 09:02.209
so I don't really like
being around her right now.

09:02.209 --> 09:05.912
Oh, love this little chicken
so much!

09:05.912 --> 09:07.969
Mwah, mwah!
HE LAUGHS

09:07.969 --> 09:10.232
I didn't even know what'd come out
at first, you know,

09:10.232 --> 09:11.912
if it'd have cloven feet.

09:11.912 --> 09:14.552
I thought I could've been
siring the Antichrist.

09:14.552 --> 09:17.249
Because, you know, I sold drugs
to Slobodan Milosevic.

09:17.249 --> 09:19.592
Dave!Oh! Sorry. Sorry.

09:19.592 --> 09:22.369
Guns.

09:22.369 --> 09:24.992
IN A WHISPER:Drugs and guns.

09:24.992 --> 09:27.992
How was your day? How was school?
Yeah! Grand.

09:27.992 --> 09:31.489
OK, one of my kids
has started wetting himself,

09:31.489 --> 09:34.832
so the parents are coming in
to see me tomorrow.

09:34.832 --> 09:37.232
It's happened a few times now,
God love him,

09:37.232 --> 09:40.352
and I don't know whether something's
going on at home.Oh, my goodness.

09:40.352 --> 09:42.529
Yeah. It's difficult
to know what to do,

09:42.529 --> 09:45.272
but sometimes I think
this is what I'm good at.

09:45.272 --> 09:47.809
I hate that he's wetting himself,
but at the same time,

09:47.809 --> 09:52.352
this is where I can really...
I dunno. Shine.

09:52.352 --> 09:56.609
You know what I mean.
You know what we do.

09:56.609 --> 10:01.952
Oh.

10:01.952 --> 10:04.352
Oh, there's salad in
the bowl there, if you...

10:04.352 --> 10:06.752
Oh, thank you, honey.
We're all good.

10:06.752 --> 10:10.472
Did Rob tell you how much he enjoyed
    his first meeting today?

10:10.472 --> 10:19.232
Looks like we might have two Quakers
         in the family!

10:19.232 --> 10:23.552
I don't understand why the idea
of me becoming a better person,

10:23.552 --> 10:26.209
or at least trying to, puts
such a cockroach up your asshole.

10:26.209 --> 10:28.232
Number one, you're too busy.

10:28.232 --> 10:32.072
You'd have to go to bloody weekly
harvest feasts and what have you.

10:32.072 --> 10:35.192
You've already got AA,
therapy, work...

10:35.192 --> 10:38.432
And, you know, what about me?
Will I have to wear a bonnet?

10:38.432 --> 10:40.609
Don't think this doesn't affect us.

10:40.609 --> 10:43.352
I don't think
you're gonna have to wear a bonnet.

10:43.352 --> 10:49.729
You don't think? You don't know.
Why don't I ask 'em?

10:49.729 --> 10:51.992
What was all that about at dinner?
All what?

10:51.992 --> 10:55.712
The...Tupperware. What's up with
the briefcase of vegetables?

10:55.712 --> 10:59.912
Maybe Jimmy has scurvy. I mean,
in America they ship vegetables

10:59.912 --> 11:02.072
past poor neighbourhoods
under armed guard.

11:02.072 --> 11:06.272
Yeah, but I serve vegetables.
Maybe he needs pure, uncut veg,

11:06.272 --> 11:10.592
you know, and not spinach dissolved
in butter and tinned tomatoes...

11:10.592 --> 11:13.112
which I like, but let's not pretend
Jamie Oliver's

11:13.112 --> 11:15.272
gonna be poking his head
out of the cupboard

11:15.272 --> 11:18.752
asking for the recipe any time soon.

11:18.752 --> 11:22.952
Get your feet off me.

11:22.952 --> 11:27.032
So I just wondered if there were
any difficulties at home.

11:27.032 --> 11:29.912
I mean, it's happened a few times
now, and I wanna help,

11:29.912 --> 11:36.769
but I guess I need the whole picture
     to be able to do that.

11:36.769 --> 11:39.512
He's scared of you.Right.

11:39.512 --> 11:42.872
What?He's scared to put his hand up
        to go to the loo

11:42.872 --> 11:46.592
when he's in your class.

11:46.592 --> 11:49.249
SHE CHUCKLES
OK.

11:49.249 --> 11:51.992
Well, I'm surprised to hear that.

11:51.992 --> 11:54.992
Um... I'm not gonna reject it
out of hand.

11:54.992 --> 11:57.872
If that's how he feels...
you know, says he feels...

11:57.872 --> 12:00.512
if that's what you're saying
he says he feels,

12:00.512 --> 12:04.609
but, um, I guess I've just never
made anyone pee themselves before,

12:04.609 --> 12:07.832
er, that I'm aware of,
to my knowledge.

12:07.832 --> 12:10.849
OK. Let me just, um...

12:10.849 --> 12:14.312
Let me digest that.
Er, and while I have you,

12:14.312 --> 12:17.432
I notice you haven't been filling in
       the parent section

12:17.432 --> 12:21.152
of his reading log.
If you could get back on that...

12:21.152 --> 12:22.849
I don't hand them out for fun.

12:22.849 --> 12:25.729
Of course.

12:25.729 --> 12:36.207
Bye.Bye. Bye-bye.

12:36.207 --> 12:38.504
Oh, look! There he is!

12:38.504 --> 12:41.967
There's another one.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

12:41.967 --> 12:44.727
And again.
Yeah. Do you want a drink?

12:44.727 --> 12:47.144
Yeah.
White wine?Yeah.

12:47.144 --> 12:55.167
MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS
BUZZ OF CONVERSATION

12:55.167 --> 12:57.567
Hey.
Hey.

12:57.567 --> 13:00.087
Fran, this is Tanya.

13:00.087 --> 13:02.984
Tanya, Fran.
Pleased to meet you.

13:02.984 --> 13:06.927
And you. Heard a lot about you.
Oh! All good, I doubt.

13:06.927 --> 13:10.664
Yes. I mean...no.
Not doubt. All...good.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.744
Did you see Jeffrey?
Yes. I popped backstage.

13:12.744 --> 13:18.344
Went through his vocal warm-up
with him. "The tip of the tongue,
the teeth and the lips."

13:18.344 --> 13:21.567
"Give me the gift
of a grip-top sock."

13:21.567 --> 13:24.807
"Red leather, yellow leather."
I'm just gonna pop to the loo.

13:24.807 --> 13:29.967
Won't make it to the interval
with my tiny bladder.

13:29.967 --> 13:33.927
"Tiny bladder"?
That code for tight pussy?

13:33.927 --> 13:37.167
Not really.

13:37.167 --> 13:39.327
She's very pretty.
Oh, thank you.

13:39.327 --> 13:43.527
But a lot of people are pretty when
they're younger. Enjoy the play.

13:43.527 --> 13:47.607
Hi.

13:47.607 --> 13:49.544
SUBDUED MURMUR OF CONVERSATION

13:49.544 --> 13:52.047
Did you see the way
she looked at him?Who?

13:52.047 --> 13:55.767
Chris's new girlfriend.

13:55.767 --> 13:58.407
BOTH LAUGH

13:58.407 --> 14:01.407
He's obviously very fond of her.
Is that bad?

14:01.407 --> 14:03.207
No.

14:03.207 --> 14:08.487
It's just...

14:08.487 --> 14:12.807
..I'm not sure we ever looked at
each other like that.

14:12.807 --> 14:16.767
FRAN SIGHS HEAVILY

14:16.767 --> 14:23.967
Ssh!
CONVERSATION DIES AWAY

14:23.967 --> 14:26.607
FRAN GASPS

14:26.607 --> 14:30.024
If music be the food of love...

14:30.024 --> 14:33.384
..play on. Give me excess of it

14:33.384 --> 14:36.687
that, surfeiting,
the appetite may sicken...

14:36.687 --> 14:39.447
FRAN SOBS
..and so die.

14:39.447 --> 14:46.527
FRAN SOBS

14:46.527 --> 14:49.287
Hey, you're home early.
Yeah. The play finished early

14:49.287 --> 14:51.927
because, er... I left early.

14:51.927 --> 14:54.087
Do you wanna eat?
Yeah, OK.

14:54.087 --> 14:56.264
Also, Jeffrey's penis is huge.

14:56.264 --> 14:58.527
I mean, it just felt wrong
looking at it.

14:58.527 --> 15:01.647
Does Chris have a big cock?
It feels big,

15:01.647 --> 15:04.647
but I've only felt it in the dark.
I mean, it was...

15:04.647 --> 15:06.824
They were all naked, you know?

15:06.824 --> 15:08.967
I mean,
I like looking at naked people.

15:08.967 --> 15:11.304
I sometimes like seeing plays.
But TOGETHER...

15:11.304 --> 15:13.407
And it was a small theatre,
you know?

15:13.407 --> 15:17.127
I could definitely smell
their actory arseholes.Yum!

15:17.127 --> 15:19.527
Couldn't concentrate anyway.

15:19.527 --> 15:23.367
Kept thinking about the pee kid
and his parents, you know?

15:23.367 --> 15:25.767
Saying I scare him.
Now Hammond's getting involved.

15:25.767 --> 15:29.247
Just seems so insane to me!
It's not THAT insane.

15:29.247 --> 15:32.847
I'm not afraid of you, but it's not
impossible that a kid might be.

15:32.847 --> 15:35.607
If I were three feet shorter,
and you made it clear

15:35.607 --> 15:38.727
that I'd disappointed you,
it's possible I might piss myself.

15:38.727 --> 15:42.344
Yeah, but I don't act at school
the way I act with you guys.

15:42.344 --> 15:45.207
I would never behave out
in the world the way I do at home.

15:45.207 --> 15:47.967
DOOR BANGS
Oh, hey!Hey!

15:47.967 --> 15:51.567
How was the play?You know what?
I'm not a big theatre-goer,

15:51.567 --> 15:55.407
so I'm probably not the best judge,
but I'd say really terrible.

15:55.407 --> 15:58.527
Oh. Well, this looks delicious.

15:58.527 --> 16:06.207
Oh, hang on.
I've got a little, er...

16:06.207 --> 16:08.967
There you go. That OK?

16:08.967 --> 16:11.624
Jimmy?

16:11.624 --> 16:13.887
Can I get you anything else?

16:13.887 --> 16:20.487
No, thanks. This is so, so good!

16:20.487 --> 16:27.807
Whoo!

16:27.807 --> 16:30.567
I find it funny
that you think I'm scary.

16:30.567 --> 16:35.784
I'm not even cross. I was actually
laughing on my way over here.

16:35.784 --> 16:40.527
SHE LAUGHS

16:40.527 --> 16:48.327
So, tell me what it is
that you find scary about me, Sam.

16:48.327 --> 16:51.327
HE WHISPERS

16:51.327 --> 16:53.384
Everything.
SHE MOUTHS

16:53.384 --> 16:55.784
OK. Well, um...

16:55.784 --> 17:00.264
I'm not scary.
I'm just a woman with opinions,

17:00.264 --> 17:02.847
and, um, for some people
that IS scary,

17:02.847 --> 17:05.127
but...

17:05.127 --> 17:07.527
Um, what...
Do you know what I think?

17:07.527 --> 17:09.807
I think we're all scared
of something, right?

17:09.807 --> 17:12.207
You know what I'm scared of?
Climate change.

17:12.207 --> 17:15.207
What are YOU scared of?

17:15.207 --> 17:17.007
You.

17:17.007 --> 17:21.567
OK. Um, well, do you know what else
I'm scared of?

17:21.567 --> 17:24.584
Britain First.

17:24.584 --> 17:28.047
White nationalists, you know?
I mean, where do they get off?

17:28.047 --> 17:32.264
Why are they so...
What else are you scared of?

17:32.264 --> 17:34.344
Nothing.

17:34.344 --> 17:38.127
You're only scared of me?

17:38.127 --> 17:44.367
Well, that's...
I'm sorry. I can't work with that.

17:44.367 --> 17:48.567
I mean, obviously I don't want
my wife to have a drunk husband,

17:48.567 --> 17:52.647
cos I like her. She's a nice person.
I mean, not lately, but...

17:52.647 --> 17:57.087
I mean, I'm going to AA and therapy.
I got kettlebells.

17:57.087 --> 18:01.767
But, you know, I look in the mirror,
and I'm, like, "Meh."

18:01.767 --> 18:03.927
Can you fix that here?

18:03.927 --> 18:06.447
YOU could fix that here.
Well, great!

18:06.447 --> 18:09.327
You know, because I really enjoyed
the meeting the other day.

18:09.327 --> 18:12.207
I mean, the quiet...
In my home, we don't have that.

18:12.207 --> 18:15.624
My wife is not a quiet person.
She's Irish, so...

18:15.624 --> 18:18.327
I mean, at first that's charming,
but after a while...

18:18.327 --> 18:20.727
Of course.
Oh, one other question,

18:20.727 --> 18:22.767
er, that I already know
the answer to,

18:22.767 --> 18:26.247
but I promised my wife I'd ask.
Will she have to wear a bonnet?

18:26.247 --> 18:30.344
Well, normally we don't bring
bonnets up until later.

18:30.344 --> 18:35.247
Are you serious?
I am not.

18:35.247 --> 18:38.024
And the quiet there! I mean...

18:38.024 --> 18:40.584
you can be quiet. You can be gay.

18:40.584 --> 18:42.824
You don't even have to believe
in God.

18:42.824 --> 18:45.807
Mm-hm.It's just good people
doing good things.

18:45.807 --> 18:48.447
You should come along.
You know I can't.

18:48.447 --> 18:50.727
Why not?
Because of my condition.

18:50.727 --> 18:52.647
What condition?
I don't want to.

18:52.647 --> 18:55.304
HE CHUCKLES
Look, it's different for you.

18:55.304 --> 18:58.407
You're American. You can go on
journeys or whatever.

18:58.407 --> 19:01.887
I can't change. I'm a teacher.
I frighten the kids I teach.

19:01.887 --> 19:04.767
I don't even know what to do about
that.You'll deal with it your way.

19:04.767 --> 19:08.487
You're a good teacher.
Fuck the piss kid!

19:08.487 --> 19:11.624
Yeah, but what if I'm like the nuns
who used to terrify me?

19:11.624 --> 19:14.487
You think I'm angry.
Anger is OK.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.887
It's not OK to punch your daughter
in the head,

19:16.887 --> 19:19.527
but it's OK to feel anger.
Why wouldn't you be angry?

19:19.527 --> 19:22.527
Life is shitty.
Sydney's not angry.

19:22.527 --> 19:26.847
Your Quakers aren't angry.
Well, maybe they should be.

19:26.847 --> 19:30.824
I'm gonna talk to Brother Lucien
about this.

19:30.824 --> 19:35.007
OK. Just...
Just don't leave me behind,

19:35.007 --> 19:37.287
all right?
Don't become a better person,

19:37.287 --> 19:39.944
and then look at me,
and think you don't need me.

19:39.944 --> 19:55.304
I'm not gonna leave you behind.

19:55.304 --> 19:57.704
What are you doing here, Sam?

19:57.704 --> 20:00.807
Are you in trouble?

20:00.807 --> 20:07.167
What's that?
Something bad you wrote?

20:07.167 --> 20:09.704
Can I see it? Sam?

20:09.704 --> 20:12.447
Can I see it? Can you show it to me?

20:12.447 --> 20:14.727
Can you...

20:14.727 --> 20:28.904
Sam, can you just... Thank you!

20:28.904 --> 20:31.887
Is that about Sonny Batali's mum?

20:31.887 --> 20:39.207
OK.

20:39.207 --> 20:44.607
I know some people.
I can make it go away.

20:44.607 --> 20:47.127
Are you still scared of me?

20:47.127 --> 20:49.887
No.
Good!

20:49.887 --> 20:52.887
Back to class.

20:52.887 --> 20:56.847
Hate is short. Love is very long.

20:56.847 --> 20:59.727
Together,
let us weather the passing storms,

20:59.727 --> 21:05.487
and in the long term,
love will somehow win over hatred.

21:05.487 --> 21:08.007
Somehow.
Sorry?

21:08.007 --> 21:11.727
No. It was just you said "somehow",
and you mentioned long-term.

21:11.727 --> 21:15.327
I need more help faster.

21:15.327 --> 21:20.967
I'm afraid patience and humility is
a big part of what we practise here.

21:20.967 --> 21:24.584
We don't offer magical answers.

21:24.584 --> 21:28.047
Did you know this?

21:28.047 --> 21:31.304
May I ask you a question?Of course.
What are Quakers' thoughts

21:31.304 --> 21:34.184
on all the chaos in the world?
How do you mean?

21:34.184 --> 21:39.687
Well, Gaza, Syria. Florida, you know?
Are you angry about all that?

21:39.687 --> 21:43.304
And what about all the butting heads
- Jews and Muslims?

21:43.304 --> 21:45.864
Christians?
What do you think about them?

21:45.864 --> 21:48.104
Well, we wish them ALL the best.

21:48.104 --> 21:51.207
Oh, come on. You have an opinion!

21:51.207 --> 21:54.567
If you bottle up all that anger,
you're gonna have an embolism.

21:54.567 --> 21:57.927
Maybe you SHOULD be angry.
Why are you so laid-back?

21:57.927 --> 22:00.327
Is this a pot thing?

22:00.327 --> 22:03.327
You know, I feel like
you're trying to sell me a condo

22:03.327 --> 22:06.087
that on the outside looks nice,
but on the inside,

22:06.087 --> 22:09.704
there's no floors,
and just some rat riding around

22:09.704 --> 22:11.967
on an electric wheelchair.
Pardon?

22:11.967 --> 22:15.447
You know, I don't think this
is gonna work out. I'm quitting.

22:15.447 --> 22:18.687
And, er, I'm not saying
that you guys should quit,

22:18.687 --> 22:29.487
but you should have a plan
in case you get into power.

22:29.487 --> 22:29.727
Come here.
Oh, I loved having you here so much!

22:29.727 --> 22:35.727
You're the best.
And getting to know Jimmy.

22:35.727 --> 22:39.567
Ah, it's a wonderful thing.

22:39.567 --> 22:41.607
Well, what?
Um...

22:41.607 --> 22:45.447
Can I just ask about the vegetables?
      About the Tupperware?

22:45.447 --> 22:48.327
Oh, sure. Go say goodbye to Frankie.
              Sure.

22:48.327 --> 22:51.927
Oh, no, it's not a big... It's just,
I would always serve vegetables,

22:51.927 --> 22:54.927
but you'd still... You'd always...
I should've explained.

22:54.927 --> 22:57.687
Jimmy's dad was the cook
in their family,

22:57.687 --> 23:00.264
and when he went to prison,
his mom would do him

23:00.264 --> 23:02.504
the same red-and-yellow vegetables
his dad used to,

23:02.504 --> 23:04.767
which was sort of
their little thing.

23:04.767 --> 23:07.047
And then, when his mom died,

23:07.047 --> 23:10.647
he got pretty obsessed with having
the same shape and colour vegetables

23:10.647 --> 23:14.247
she used to make for him. I just
didn't want you guys to have to...

23:14.247 --> 23:18.824
I dunno, bother with all that.
So I just did it.

23:18.824 --> 23:21.704
SHE SIGHS
Oh, my God!

23:21.704 --> 23:23.847
Oh, my God!

23:23.847 --> 23:26.024
We're such arseholes!

23:26.024 --> 23:29.607
Because we were just, "What's up
with the vegetable briefcase?"

23:29.607 --> 23:32.904
It's not a briefcase.I'm sorry.
It was just our little joke.

23:32.904 --> 23:38.847

He's missed five calls this trip.

Hello.

Yes, I'm having a great trip.
Thank you for asking.

23:50.727 --> 23:59.007
The more time zones
that separate us, the happier I am.

23:59.007 --> 24:03.687
Because you're a brown stripe
on my fucking panties, that's why.

24:03.687 --> 24:06.687
Well, unless you're calling to tell
me that you're wiring the money

24:06.687 --> 24:09.927
that you stole from me, or figured
out a way to fix my broken heart

24:09.927 --> 24:12.584
that doesn't involve
ever seeing you again,

24:12.584 --> 24:16.047
you can fuck the fuck off.

24:16.047 --> 24:17.967
OK! Yeah.

Oh, you...

Argh!
BABY GURGLES IN BACKGROUND

24:28.904 --> 24:30.927
Oh!

24:30.927 --> 24:33.327
I think I'm going to be sick.

24:33.327 --> 24:35.847
No, no. I'm fine.

24:35.847 --> 24:37.167
Fine.

24:37.167 --> 24:40.104
OK, no. I am gonna be sick.

24:40.104 --> 24:46.407
