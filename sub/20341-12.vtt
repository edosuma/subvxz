(giggles)
That's just rain, Rolly.

02:03.375 --> 02:05.875
Rain? Oh, good.
If it keeps raining,

02:05.875 --> 02:08.375
we can jump in muddly puddles

It's raining.

02:19.833 --> 02:21.458
(yawn) I know.

02:21.458 --> 02:24.375
-Whatever you do, don't--
-(water shaking noises)

02:25.708 --> 02:29.250
Do that.
Don't you know
that cats hate water?

02:29.250 --> 02:32.000
Ugh, I just woke up,
and I already need a nap.

02:34.458 --> 02:37.333
Ow!
Why is there a stick
in my bed?

02:37.333 --> 02:40.833
It's a present for you!
It's the first stick
I ever collected!

02:40.833 --> 02:43.291
Oh, uh, thanks.

02:43.291 --> 02:47.958
I'll keep it somewhere special,
like, over there.

02:47.958 --> 02:51.500
Yeah, that's
a great spot for it.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.416
Both:
Captain Dog!

02:54.416 --> 02:59.500
Once again, I have saved
Barksville from the world's
worst villain...

02:59.500 --> 03:01.458
Bad-Dog.

03:06.750 --> 03:11.250
But the Captain Dog headquarter
are about to wash away
in that flood!

03:11.250 --> 03:13.458
Can anybody help this hero?

03:13.458 --> 03:15.250
We can!
Get some trees, beavers!

03:16.458 --> 03:20.250

03:20.250 --> 03:21.458
(water rushing up)

03:22.750 --> 03:25.875
Thank you!
This beaver dam you built

03:25.875 --> 03:28.583
saved the Captain Dog
headquarters!

03:28.583 --> 03:32.125
Arf, arf and away!

03:32.125 --> 03:35.166
-Both:
Yaaay!
-(thunder booms)

03:35.166 --> 03:37.500
Sounds like that cloud outside
has a cough, too.

03:37.500 --> 03:40.208
(giggles)
That's thunder, Rolly.

03:40.208 --> 03:42.166
Sometimes it thunders
when it rains.

03:42.166 --> 03:44.000
(thunder booms)

03:45.458 --> 03:47.583
Uh-oh!
We've gotta do something

03:47.583 --> 03:48.875
before our doghouse
washes away.

03:48.875 --> 03:51.458
Lucky for us
you've got a plan!

03:51.458 --> 03:52.500
You do have a plan, right?

03:52.500 --> 03:54.125
Of course!

03:54.125 --> 03:56.625
You know how the beavers
built that beaver dam
for Captain Dog?

03:56.625 --> 03:58.166
You mean that thingy
made of sticks

03:58.166 --> 03:59.875
that kept the
Captain Dog headquarters

03:59.875 --> 04:01.000
from floating away?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.375
Exactly!
We should build
something like that

04:03.375 --> 04:05.458
to keep our doghouse
from floating away.

04:05.458 --> 04:06.583
Puppy-rific idea!

04:06.583 --> 04:08.250
Do you know how to build
a beaver dam?

04:08.250 --> 04:11.000
No clue.
But you know who does?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.750
-Beavers!
-Construction workers!

04:13.708 --> 04:15.416
Beavers, I meant beavers.

04:15.416 --> 04:18.208
Right.
So our mission is
to find a beaver to teach us

04:18.208 --> 04:20.250
so we can protect
the doghouse for Bob!

04:20.250 --> 04:23.583

knock down a tree

07:01.750 --> 07:03.625

07:03.625 --> 07:05.458

have those big teeth?

07:05.458 --> 07:07.458
Yeah, they're kinda
hard to miss.

07:07.458 --> 07:09.750
Well, we have teeth, too.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.958
Maybe we can chew down
a tree like Bizzy.

07:11.958 --> 07:13.625
I love chewing on sticks,

07:13.625 --> 07:15.750
and trees are basically
like big sticks!

07:15.750 --> 07:16.958
Let's do this!

07:16.958 --> 07:20.583
(gnawing sounds)

07:24.583 --> 07:26.583
This tree's bark
is worse than our bite.

07:26.583 --> 07:28.583
I thought it would've
fallen over by now.

07:28.583 --> 07:29.583
Me, too.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.416
How else can we
knock down a tree?

07:31.416 --> 07:33.708
With Rolly power, that's how!

07:33.708 --> 07:36.583
Get ready to fall over, tree!

07:38.625 --> 07:40.250
-Whoa! (grunts)
-(crash)

07:41.708 --> 07:44.083
(giggling)

07:44.083 --> 07:46.833

fall over instead!

07:46.833 --> 07:47.625
(chomp)

07:48.708 --> 07:50.708
Do you think this tree
will be big enough

07:50.708 --> 07:52.458

beaver dam?

07:52.458 --> 07:53.875

07:59.708 --> 08:01.875

a tree after all.

08:01.875 --> 08:03.625

08:59.000 --> 09:00.125

09:00.125 --> 09:02.333
Not yet.
The water is still leaking

09:02.333 --> 09:04.708
through right there, see?

09:04.708 --> 09:06.500
It's only a little leak, though.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.375
But little leaks
can turn into big leaks, see?

09:10.875 --> 09:12.333
The water will keep
pushing more

09:12.333 --> 09:13.833
and more sticks
out of place!

09:13.833 --> 09:15.833
If I don't plug
that hole fast,

09:15.833 --> 09:17.708
this could all fall apart!

09:17.708 --> 09:19.250
Then we'll help you
find a stick

09:19.250 --> 09:21.000
that's a perfect fit!

09:21.000 --> 09:22.166
Got one!

09:26.583 --> 09:29.625

09:33.708 --> 09:35.250
Oh, it's not the right shape.

09:35.250 --> 09:36.833
Oh, the leak's getting worse.

09:36.833 --> 09:37.875
And none
of these sticks fit

09:37.875 --> 09:39.625
in that squiggly-looking hole.

09:42.583 --> 09:43.958
How about this stick?

09:46.125 --> 09:47.875
It's the perfect fit!

09:47.875 --> 09:49.125
Thanks for your help,
puppy dogs!

09:49.125 --> 09:51.083
I couldn't have
finished this without you,

09:51.083 --> 09:52.875
and your
squiggly stick.

09:52.875 --> 09:55.333
Well, thanks for showing us
how to build a beaver dam.

09:55.333 --> 09:58.750
Now we've gotta go build
our own to save our doghouse.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.750
(rapping)
♪ Good luck, little pups
Nice work today ♪

10:00.750 --> 10:03.000
♪ I hope
you keep your doghouse
from floating away ♪

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Huh!
Stick drop!

10:05.000 --> 10:06.500
-Bingo: Thanks, Bizzy!
-Rolly: Bye!

10:09.333 --> 10:11.750
Oh, no!
The rain got even rainier!

10:11.750 --> 10:15.125
We've gotta build fast
before the doghouse
washes away!

10:15.125 --> 10:16.166
Then it's a good thing

10:16.166 --> 10:18.458
we already have
a huge pile of sticks!

10:18.458 --> 10:20.208
My stick collection!

10:25.583 --> 10:27.625
Hurry!
The water's coming faster!

10:27.625 --> 10:29.708
I'm hurrying
as fast as I can!

10:31.875 --> 10:33.708
Both:
♪ Criss cross
use your paws ♪

10:33.708 --> 10:36.000
♪ Lay one stick
over the other ♪

10:36.000 --> 10:37.875
♪ I say criss cross
Use your paws ♪

10:37.875 --> 10:40.500
♪ Now I'm building
a beaver dam with my brother ♪

10:42.208 --> 10:44.000
Our dam looks pup-tastic!

10:44.000 --> 10:46.208
We're practically beavers!

10:46.208 --> 10:47.833
Eek! A leak!

10:47.833 --> 10:51.000
Just like the one
in Bizzy's beaver dam!

10:51.000 --> 10:52.708
And the leak is getting bigger!

10:52.708 --> 10:54.708
Just like he said it might!

10:54.708 --> 10:56.166
We need more sticks!

10:56.166 --> 10:59.083
But there aren't any more!
We used them all, Bingo!

10:59.083 --> 11:01.458
Oh, if only we had
one more stick!

11:01.458 --> 11:03.958
-You do!
-Hissy!

11:03.958 --> 11:06.416
(gasp)
The stick!

11:08.875 --> 11:12.458
(shuddering)

11:13.833 --> 11:17.166
Come on, Hissy!
It's just water!

11:17.166 --> 11:19.083
I'm coming, puppies!

11:27.833 --> 11:29.833
It looked like you needed this.

11:29.833 --> 11:33.000
We did need that!
And look! We stopped the water!

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Our doghouse isn't gonna
float away after all!

11:35.000 --> 11:37.708
Captain Dog would be proud
of us, right, Hissy?

11:37.708 --> 11:40.375
-Hissy?
-I'll meetcha inside!

11:40.375 --> 11:42.125
(both giggling)

11:42.125 --> 11:43.875
(blow dryer)

11:43.875 --> 11:45.208
Hissy is all dry!

11:45.208 --> 11:46.875
Thanks, ARF.

11:46.875 --> 11:49.000
Well, it's a good thing
that big pile of sticks

11:49.000 --> 11:50.250
washed up
by your doghouse

11:50.250 --> 11:52.500
to keep it
from floating away.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.083
We put the sticks
there, Bob!

11:54.083 --> 11:55.166
Yeah! We built a dam!

11:55.166 --> 11:56.458
(barking)

11:56.458 --> 11:58.958
After it stops raining,
I'll fix up the back yard

11:58.958 --> 12:01.958
so it doesn't flood next time
there's a storm.

12:01.958 --> 12:03.875
But for right now,

12:03.875 --> 12:06.166
what do you say
we curl up on the couch

12:06.166 --> 12:07.958
and watch some "Captain Dog"?

12:07.958 --> 12:08.833
(dogs barking)

12:10.000 --> 12:11.583
(purring)

12:15.958 --> 12:18.000
(rooster crows)

12:18.000 --> 12:19.208
(Bingo and Rolly speak)

12:21.750 --> 12:23.083
Is it time to wake Bob?

12:23.083 --> 12:25.166
Wait for it...

12:25.166 --> 12:27.083
wait for it...

12:27.083 --> 12:28.958
Now!

12:28.958 --> 12:31.083
-Bob, wake up!
-Good morning, Bob!

12:31.083 --> 12:32.125
Where's Bob?

12:32.125 --> 12:33.875
Maybe he's playing
hide and seek.

12:33.875 --> 12:36.208
Bob? Bob?

12:36.208 --> 12:37.583
Well, he's not hiding
under here.

12:37.583 --> 12:39.125
Bob?

12:39.125 --> 12:41.083
He's not hiding
under there,either.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.250
Then let's go find out
where he is!

12:43.250 --> 12:45.833
-Hi, Bob!
-We went to wake you
but you weren't there!

12:45.833 --> 12:47.833
(dogs barking)

12:47.833 --> 12:49.083
(yawns)

12:49.083 --> 12:52.166
Good morning,
puppy pals.

12:52.166 --> 12:54.625
I could not fall asleep
last night.

12:54.625 --> 12:57.250
I just didn't feel tired.

12:57.250 --> 13:00.250
I tried everything I could
think of to help me get sleepy.

13:00.250 --> 13:03.291
Huh-- Let's see, I came down
for some warm milk,

13:03.291 --> 13:05.833
then I read myself
a bedtime story.

13:05.833 --> 13:07.708
ARF even sang me
a lullaby.

13:07.708 --> 13:11.875
♪ Go to sleep
Go to sleep, Bob ♪

13:11.875 --> 13:13.750
ARF sang many verses.

13:13.750 --> 13:14.875
It did not work.

13:14.875 --> 13:17.458
Maybe I should've tried
counting sheep.

13:18.583 --> 13:21.000
Hey, where's my messenger bag?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.750
Oh! I'm holding it!

13:22.750 --> 13:24.958
Huh! I am tired!

13:24.958 --> 13:26.083
(door closes)

13:26.083 --> 13:28.583
Do we have a mission
or what?

13:28.583 --> 13:30.000
I'm actually asking.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.708
Our mission?
Oh, yeah!

13:31.708 --> 13:33.500
Our mission is
to bring Bob some sheep

13:33.500 --> 13:35.875
so he can count them
and fall asleep tonight.

13:35.875 --> 13:38.333
Counting sheep
is just an expression, guys.

13:38.333 --> 13:40.208
It means
you imagine sheep

13:40.208 --> 13:42.166
and count them
until you get sleepy.

13:42.166 --> 13:45.000
ARF?
A little demonstration,
if you please.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
Oh! ARF would love
to help, Hissy.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
-One, two...
-(sheep bleating)

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
(yawn) Three?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.333
See? I'm already sleepy.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.000
But you know what's even
better than imaginary sheep?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.583
Real sheep!

13:58.583 --> 14:00.583
So we're gonna
find some for Bob!

14:05.458 --> 14:07.750
There are oodles of sheep
on this farm.

14:07.750 --> 14:10.208
Now we just need
to bring 'em to Bob's house
so he can count them!

14:13.000 --> 14:16.083
Excuse me, sheep!
Can we have your
attention, please?

14:16.083 --> 14:18.000
(sheep baa-ing)

14:18.000 --> 14:20.708
I forgot.
I don't speak sheep.

14:20.708 --> 14:23.166
Me neither!
How can we get 'em
to follow us home

14:23.166 --> 14:24.458
if we can't ask 'em?

14:24.458 --> 14:27.125
(dog barking)

14:27.125 --> 14:30.625
Strider:
Sheep! Sheepy sheep sheep!

14:30.625 --> 14:32.250
Maybe that dog can help us!

14:32.250 --> 14:34.291
All together now!
That's right!

14:34.291 --> 14:36.083
Get those hooves in gear!

14:37.208 --> 14:39.000
One sheep, two sheep,
three sheep--

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Wait! You're not a sheep!

14:41.000 --> 14:42.375
My name's Bingo!

14:42.375 --> 14:44.583
And this is
my brother, Rolly!

14:44.583 --> 14:48.458
Baaa!
(giggles) I'm a dog, too!

14:48.458 --> 14:49.708
I was just pretending.

14:49.708 --> 14:52.208
Hi, Bingo and Rolly!
I'm Strider.

14:52.208 --> 14:53.750
What brings you pups
to the farm?

14:53.750 --> 14:56.708
Our owner Bob
needs to count sheep
so he can fall asleep.

14:56.708 --> 14:58.750
But we don't have any sheep
at our house.

14:58.750 --> 15:01.000
We were hoping
we could borrow yours.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
Sure, sure.
Sleep is important.
Everybody needs sleep.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.458
But before you
borrow the sheep,

15:05.458 --> 15:06.875
I've gotta teach you
how to herd 'em,

15:06.875 --> 15:08.208
so you can get 'em
all to your house.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.208
Come on, George,
no nonsense!

15:10.208 --> 15:11.333
The trick to herding is,

15:11.333 --> 15:12.625
you gotta
keep the sheep together.

15:12.625 --> 15:14.083
Don't let anybody wander off.

15:14.083 --> 15:15.958
No wandering off.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.875
We've got it!
Right, Rolly?

15:17.875 --> 15:20.625
I can't hear you!
I wandered off!

15:20.625 --> 15:23.500
Looks like your brother
and my sheep have a lot
in common. (laughs)

15:23.500 --> 15:25.708
All right,
sheepdogs in training,

15:25.708 --> 15:27.250
who's ready
to herd some sheep?

15:27.250 --> 15:28.708
Let's do this for Bob!

15:28.708 --> 15:31.416
Let's get the sheep
to walk in a straight line
and then turn!

15:31.416 --> 15:33.833
Run beside them
and bark like this!

15:33.833 --> 15:36.000
Keep it moving!
Now you've got it!

15:36.000 --> 15:38.250
You know what's even more fun
than herding sheep?

15:38.250 --> 15:40.208
-Both: What?
-Nothing!

15:40.208 --> 15:43.208
Herding sheep
is the most fun thing
in the whole world!

15:43.208 --> 15:46.083
Wow!
She is really into this!

15:46.083 --> 15:48.208
Watch me! Watch me!

15:48.208 --> 15:49.708
When it's time to turn them,

15:49.708 --> 15:52.166
go to the front of the flock
and bark bark bark bark bark!

15:52.166 --> 15:55.833
Then, you make a serious
herding face and stare at them,
like this!

15:55.833 --> 15:57.583
-(bleat)
-All sheep:
Baaaa...

15:57.583 --> 15:59.625
Yay, turning!
Yah, sheep!

15:59.625 --> 16:02.291
Now back back back,
so the puppies can try!

16:02.291 --> 16:04.291
(laughs) Your turn!

16:04.291 --> 16:06.833
Wow, those sheep
gotta outta line fast.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.458
Then let's get them back
in line even faster!

16:10.458 --> 16:12.166
(grunt) Line it up, sheep!

16:12.166 --> 16:13.458
Please be in a line?

16:13.458 --> 16:15.291
You can do it!
Just keep trying!

16:15.291 --> 16:16.375
(bleat)

16:16.375 --> 16:18.125
Herding is harder
than it looks.

16:18.125 --> 16:20.208
You'll get the hang of it.

16:20.208 --> 16:21.458
Strider:
Good lookin' line!

16:21.458 --> 16:23.000
Now try getting them to turn!

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Bark and stare!

16:24.000 --> 16:25.333
(both barking)

16:28.208 --> 16:30.208
Uh-oh!
They're not turning!

16:31.708 --> 16:33.708
(sheep baa-ing)

16:33.708 --> 16:35.208
(smash)

16:35.208 --> 16:37.291
(sheep baa-ing)

16:37.291 --> 16:39.500
Great try!
Loved the effort!

16:39.500 --> 16:41.458
How come the sheep
don't listen when we do it?

16:41.458 --> 16:43.000
Keep practicing!

16:43.000 --> 16:44.333
They just have to get
used to you!

16:44.333 --> 16:46.208
Then they'll go
wherever you want them to go!

16:46.208 --> 16:48.500
Then let's keep at it
so they get used to us!

But there's one

left to do.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.458
-High paw?
-Happy dance?

18:05.458 --> 18:09.000
Close the gate!
Always, always close the gate

18:09.000 --> 18:11.250
when you get them
where you want them to be.

18:11.250 --> 18:12.416
What happens if you open it?

18:12.416 --> 18:13.583
They leave!

18:13.583 --> 18:15.750
And if they leave,
they could get lost!

18:15.750 --> 18:17.375
So close the gate!

-Close the gate!
Got it!
-Got it!

18:19.833 --> 18:21.708
And walk in line,
and turn...

18:21.708 --> 18:24.625
And bark,
and stare like this.

18:24.625 --> 18:27.333
Just promise to look
after all the sheep, okay?

18:27.333 --> 18:29.125
Every single one.

18:29.125 --> 18:31.750
We promise, Strider.
Come on, Sheepdog Rolly!

18:31.750 --> 18:33.625
-(sheep bleating)
-Let's get herding!

18:37.875 --> 18:41.000
Rolly:
This way, sheep!
Everybody in!

18:41.000 --> 18:44.208
Hey, Bingo! Hey, Rolly!
Hey, sheep!

18:44.208 --> 18:48.583
Wait! Sheep?
Oh, brother.

18:48.583 --> 18:50.500
Yeah, we did it, Rolly.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.708
Now, when Bob
is ready to go to sleep,

18:52.708 --> 18:54.333
he'll have all these sheep
to count.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.583
Best sheep herding dogs ever!

18:59.208 --> 19:01.416
(sheep baa-ing)

19:02.875 --> 19:04.750
Seriously, dude?

19:04.750 --> 19:06.583
Your sheep
are blocking my sun.

19:10.875 --> 19:13.500
Ahh.
It's nice up here, though.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.583
Kinda like a warm cloud.

19:15.583 --> 19:17.583
Let's make sure
all the sheep are here.

19:17.583 --> 19:19.750
Yeah! Sheep-tastic idea!

19:20.750 --> 19:22.583
Baaaa!

19:22.583 --> 19:24.458
Bingo:
One sheep, two sheep,
three sheep, four.

19:24.458 --> 19:27.250
Five, six, seven, eight,
nine sheep more!

19:27.250 --> 19:29.083
Sixteen, seventeen,
eighteen sheep...

19:29.083 --> 19:30.833
Rolly:
Oh, this is makin' me tired.

19:30.833 --> 19:34.000
-Twenty-three, twenty-four...
-(gasp) Where is sheep
twenty-five?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.458
Oh, no!
We left the gate open!

19:36.458 --> 19:38.416
We promised Strider
we'd keep track

19:38.416 --> 19:40.416
of every single sheep!

19:40.416 --> 19:42.208
Then we've gotta
go find that one!

19:44.333 --> 19:47.875
-Close the gate this time.
-Right, right, thanks!

19:54.083 --> 19:55.833
There's the sheep!

19:55.833 --> 19:56.875
(bleat)

19:58.083 --> 19:59.208
Bingo:
No, no, no!

19:59.208 --> 20:00.625
-Rolly: Don't go in there!
-(school bell rings)

20:00.625 --> 20:02.333
Oh, that's not good.

20:02.333 --> 20:04.625
On the up side,
he might learn
to read or write.

20:04.625 --> 20:06.958
Come on, Rolly!

20:06.958 --> 20:08.750
Sheep do not belong in here!

20:08.750 --> 20:11.416
Yeah! Mary brought
her little lamb
to school one day

20:11.416 --> 20:12.625
and it didn't go well.

20:15.333 --> 20:16.708
-Baaa!
-There he is!

20:18.125 --> 20:19.250
(bleat)

20:19.250 --> 20:21.333
-Keep going!
-Almost there!

20:21.333 --> 20:23.208
Bingo:
We got the sheep
to walk in a line!

20:23.208 --> 20:24.833
High paw!

20:27.625 --> 20:31.416
We need to get the sheep
to turn before he runs
into the story time!

20:31.416 --> 20:34.208
What animal
is on this page, class?

20:34.208 --> 20:35.375
-A sheep!
-A sheep!

20:35.375 --> 20:37.375
-A sheep!
-That's right!

20:39.083 --> 20:40.375
And puppies!

20:40.375 --> 20:43.125
Mm! I don't see puppies
on this page.

20:43.125 --> 20:46.583
-Turn, sheep!
-Make your herding face!

20:46.583 --> 20:48.708
(bleating)

20:48.708 --> 20:51.291
-We got him to turn!
-Way to go, us!

20:51.291 --> 20:52.708
Let's get the sheep
back to Bob's house,

20:52.708 --> 20:55.125
so he can count it
and fall asleep tonight!

20:55.125 --> 20:56.708
(sheep baa-ing)

20:57.875 --> 20:59.583
Bingo:
Hey-yahh!

20:59.583 --> 21:00.458
(bleating)

21:08.458 --> 21:10.083
We got the sheep, Hissy!

21:10.083 --> 21:11.875
And we closed the gate!

21:11.875 --> 21:14.416
Excellent.

21:14.416 --> 21:16.416
-I'm home!
-(sheep bleating)

21:16.416 --> 21:18.250
Great gears!

21:18.250 --> 21:20.500
Where did all these
sheep come from?

21:20.500 --> 21:24.250
Well, I think maybe that farm
where I buy my veggies
might have sheep.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.583
-I wonder if...
-(dialing phone)

21:26.583 --> 21:28.708
Hi. Farmer Dell?

21:28.708 --> 21:31.208
Yeah, are you missing
any sheep?

21:31.208 --> 21:33.458
You are?
Well, I found them!

21:33.458 --> 21:36.416
Yeah!
In my backyard!

21:36.416 --> 21:39.416
I don't know
if they'd all fit
in a pickup truck.

21:39.416 --> 21:41.375
Let me see how many
there are.

21:41.375 --> 21:43.708
One, two, three...

21:43.708 --> 21:45.833
We did it!
Bob's counting sheep!

21:45.833 --> 21:48.458
Now he'll fall asleep
for sure.

21:48.458 --> 21:50.458
Thanks for callin'
about my sheep.

21:50.458 --> 21:52.166
I'm so glad
to have 'em back.

21:52.166 --> 21:54.000
(out of breath)
No problem!

21:54.000 --> 21:55.833
I think this is the last one!

21:55.833 --> 21:57.458
Baaaaaa!

21:57.458 --> 22:00.875
Haha! They were harder
to round up than I expected.

22:00.875 --> 22:03.500
Haha-- That's why I have
a sheepherding dog.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.625
You kept track
of every single sheep!

22:05.625 --> 22:07.583
Oh, I knew
you could do it!

22:07.583 --> 22:09.500
I just hope Bob is able
to go to sleep tonight.

22:09.500 --> 22:12.583
(whistling)
Please get this last sheep
to the rest of the herd,

22:12.583 --> 22:13.625
will ya, Strider?

22:15.875 --> 22:17.416
Go for it!

22:19.208 --> 22:22.958
(dogs barking)

22:24.708 --> 22:25.958
(laughs)

22:25.958 --> 22:27.458
Would you look at that!

22:27.458 --> 22:30.250
Seems like you have
two little sheepdogs
of your own!

22:33.583 --> 22:34.750
Thanks for teachin' us!

22:34.750 --> 22:37.500
Come on, Strider!
Let's go home!

22:37.500 --> 22:40.833
-Bye!
-Bye, guys!
Come visit!

22:40.833 --> 22:43.208
Well, that doesn't happen
every day.

22:43.208 --> 22:45.333
(yawn)

22:45.333 --> 22:47.583
I'm so tired
from counting those sheep.

22:47.583 --> 22:50.083
There's only one thing
I wanna do now.

22:51.583 --> 22:54.750
(snoring)

22:58.583 --> 23:00.500
Mission accomplished, Rolly!

23:00.500 --> 23:02.875
Bob counted sheep
just like he wanted.

23:02.875 --> 23:05.625
And he fell asleep
just like he wanted, too!

23:05.625 --> 23:07.750
(yawn)

23:07.750 --> 23:10.000
Counting sheep
made Bob sleepy,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.250
and herding shape
made me sleepy.

23:12.250 --> 23:13.750
Me, too.

23:13.750 --> 23:15.583
Sweet dreams, Rolly.

23:15.583 --> 23:16.875
Sweet dreams, Bingo.

23:16.875 --> 23:19.708
Ohhh, sweet dreams, Bob.

23:19.708 --> 23:20.833
Rolly:
Sweet dreams, Bob.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.583
Oh, yeah!
Sweet dreams, Hissy.

23:22.583 --> 23:26.333
Hissy:
Did you just wake me up
to say good night?

23:26.333 --> 23:30.750
-(dogs snoring)
-Rolly:
Baaah.

23:32.291 --> 23:35.708
(theme music playing)

23:35.708 --> 23:37.083
Both:
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:40.875 --> 23:42.250
Both:
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:43.458 --> 23:46.333
(record scratching)

23:52.208 --> 23:53.250
Both:
Bark!

23:56.625 --> 23:58.083
Both:
Bark! Bark! Bark!
