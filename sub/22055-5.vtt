00:23.437 --> 00:25.370

1 out of 5.

00:26.854 --> 00:28.476

scores from Michelle.

00:47.357 --> 00:48.531
Three hours, bro?

fiery deliberation--

01:19.355 --> 01:21.288
You served it

NARRATOR: Gio and
Josh were nominated,

01:33.990 --> 01:36.648

He's been the
weakest link all day.

01:38.063 --> 01:39.444
NARRATOR: Chef Ramsay agreed.

01:39.547 --> 01:41.929

[music playing]

02:33.118 --> 02:35.500
NARRATOR: And now thecontinuation of "Hell's Kitchen

02:35.603 --> 02:36.570
All Stars."

02:36.673 --> 02:39.573
Get out of here.

02:39.676 --> 02:42.886
It's really an uncomfortablefeeling to go from one team

02:42.990 --> 02:43.922
to the next.

02:44.025 --> 02:45.717
We were just starting
to jell, and now

02:45.820 --> 02:46.718
it's going to turn to pudding.

02:46.821 --> 02:47.650
Yeah.

02:47.753 --> 02:48.720
This is an uphill battle.

02:48.823 --> 02:51.240
And if you can't adapt, you die.

02:51.343 --> 02:53.897
So I need to talk to
the red team, my team.

02:54.001 --> 02:55.105
Elise, can we go outside?

02:55.209 --> 02:56.624
No, I don't want
to go outside.

02:56.728 --> 02:57.763
Can we go somewhere
where we can

02:57.867 --> 02:59.075
have a chat with the red team?

02:59.179 --> 03:00.628
I'm not ready to chat.

03:00.732 --> 03:02.389
Well, that's not a good start.

03:02.492 --> 03:05.115
Who does he think he is tryingto call a red team meeting?

03:05.219 --> 03:06.876
And he's been on the
team for 30 seconds.

03:06.979 --> 03:08.188
I don't think so.

03:08.291 --> 03:10.120
I'll tell you when it's ameeting, and it ain't now.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.743
I'm not worried, because
as soon as he fucks up,

03:11.846 --> 03:12.778
he'll be right back up there.

03:12.882 --> 03:14.055
So I'm not worried about it.

03:14.159 --> 03:15.678
- Listen, you need to, like--- I'm accepting it.

03:15.781 --> 03:16.851
This is me accepting it.

03:16.955 --> 03:17.680
--jump off your high
horse, Elise, please.

03:17.783 --> 03:18.819
It's not about no high horse.

03:18.922 --> 03:20.510
It's about me worried
about my team jelling.

03:20.614 --> 03:22.029
You're the only one
not gentlemen right now.

03:22.132 --> 03:23.306
I'm the only one not jelling?

03:23.410 --> 03:24.376
Yeah.
I just got on your team.

03:24.480 --> 03:25.550
I've been jelling
with my team.

03:25.653 --> 03:27.379
You're not jelling becauseyou're the newcomer.

03:27.483 --> 03:29.795
He couldn't wait to run inhere and put a red bandana on.

03:29.899 --> 03:31.245
That's corny.

03:31.349 --> 03:32.142
No.

03:34.697 --> 03:35.836
Listen to me.

03:35.939 --> 03:38.218
What you really need todo is come into this team

03:38.321 --> 03:41.117
with a really open mind,because you are about to work

03:41.221 --> 03:43.361
with a lot of really
strong personalities

03:43.464 --> 03:44.810
that aren't going to
take any bullshit.

03:44.914 --> 03:45.708
- Listen.- I'm just letting you know.

03:45.811 --> 03:46.778
Do me a favor.

03:46.881 --> 03:47.848
You worry about you.

03:47.951 --> 03:48.952
I worry about me.
- No, we're a team.

03:49.056 --> 03:50.057
And listen.

03:50.160 --> 03:50.609
We're going to worry
about each other.

03:50.713 --> 03:51.852
Whatever.

03:51.955 --> 03:54.717
Josh unfortunately hasa very aggressive attitude

03:54.820 --> 03:56.166
about this whole thing.

03:56.270 --> 03:58.652
And I'm not going to let thatbe the downfall of the red team.

03:58.755 --> 04:00.412
We just got it together,
you know what I mean?

04:00.516 --> 04:02.000
And now we have to figureit all out over again.

04:02.103 --> 04:03.450
I'm not giving you a pep talk.

04:03.553 --> 04:05.314
You need to talk to your girl,and we will all come together.

04:05.417 --> 04:06.073
That's not my girl.

04:06.176 --> 04:06.798
That's the way it works.

04:11.803 --> 04:14.564
OK, sit up.

04:14.668 --> 04:16.601
What's the matter?

04:16.704 --> 04:17.878
It's not that bad.

04:17.981 --> 04:18.844
They're a good team.

04:18.948 --> 04:20.121
It's just a mind fuck.

04:20.225 --> 04:21.226
Listen.

04:21.330 --> 04:23.435
He wants you to put
your best foot forward.

04:23.539 --> 04:25.506
He thinks that you're
just too comfortable,

04:25.610 --> 04:27.163
and he wants you to
get out of your shell.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.854
You can't look at it
as a negative thing.

04:28.958 --> 04:30.062
No, this is a positive thing.

04:30.166 --> 04:30.960
I'm trying, I know.

04:31.063 --> 04:32.064
He wants to see
the true Robyn.

04:32.168 --> 04:32.962
Yeah.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.343
That's what he's looking for.

04:34.446 --> 04:36.586
If you need somebody to pushyou, I'll fucking push you.

04:36.690 --> 04:37.518
Yeah.

04:37.622 --> 04:40.038
I just don't understand, why me?

04:40.141 --> 04:43.835
I don't deal well withbeing the new kid in school.

04:43.938 --> 04:46.320
The fact of the matter is,you're part of our team now.

04:46.424 --> 04:47.287
This is a clean slate.

04:50.220 --> 04:54.777
[intense music]

04:54.880 --> 04:55.674
Whatever.

04:55.778 --> 04:57.331
[yawns]

04:57.435 --> 04:58.643
I feel like I'm aging here.

05:00.886 --> 05:02.716
[laughs]

05:02.819 --> 05:05.684
[ringing]

05:05.788 --> 05:06.651
Morning, this is Michelle.

05:06.754 --> 05:07.721
Hi, Michelle.

05:07.824 --> 05:09.309
Chef needs you guys
outside right away.

05:09.412 --> 05:10.758
All right, got it.

05:10.862 --> 05:12.415
All right, chef
needs us in front.

05:12.519 --> 05:13.382
You ready, red team?

05:18.283 --> 05:22.943
[country music]

05:23.046 --> 05:23.875
Good morning.

05:23.978 --> 05:24.772
Oh my god.

05:24.876 --> 05:25.670
Oh, fuck.

05:25.773 --> 05:26.947
Oh no.

05:27.050 --> 05:28.466
Is that a turkey?

05:28.569 --> 05:30.260
What in the actual fuck.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.987
Line up please.

05:33.091 --> 05:33.919
Oh god.

05:36.888 --> 05:39.062
Now, as you can
see, your sous chefs

05:39.166 --> 05:40.478
were up early this
morning corralling

05:40.581 --> 05:43.101
this incredible array
of fresh protein.

05:43.204 --> 05:44.689
[laughter]

05:44.792 --> 05:45.966
So brutal.

05:46.069 --> 05:47.381
I'm an executive
chef currently.

05:47.485 --> 05:50.108
So none of these animals
are really cute to me.

05:50.211 --> 05:51.937
I look at them
and I think, duck,

05:52.041 --> 05:54.043
you're bringing me $26 a plate.

05:54.146 --> 05:56.148
Cow, you're bringing
me $28 a plate.

05:56.252 --> 05:57.460
Goat, 18 bucks.

05:57.564 --> 05:59.220
But still, you're
bringing me money.

05:59.324 --> 06:00.532
Cha ching, cha ching.

06:03.639 --> 06:07.125
Barbie, if you could cookwith anything you see in front

06:07.228 --> 06:08.195
of you, what would it be?

06:08.298 --> 06:09.576
The steer.

06:09.679 --> 06:11.371
Manda, what would it be?

06:11.474 --> 06:12.302
I would go cow, chef.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.994
Cow.
Benjamin.

06:14.097 --> 06:14.891
Lamb, chef.

06:14.995 --> 06:16.065
Lamb.

06:16.168 --> 06:19.137
Those are all
reasonable choices.

06:19.240 --> 06:24.729
But a great chef thinks outsidethe box, or shall I say,

06:24.832 --> 06:25.661
the pen.

06:25.764 --> 06:27.214
Oh, Jesus.

06:27.317 --> 06:28.767
I would cook with--

06:28.871 --> 06:29.665
Straw?

06:29.768 --> 06:30.597
Hay?

06:30.700 --> 06:31.563
This.

06:31.667 --> 06:33.047
Oh my god.

06:33.151 --> 06:34.497
What the fuck?

06:34.601 --> 06:37.051
A beautiful cedar plank.

06:37.155 --> 06:38.259
[laughter]
- Right.

06:38.363 --> 06:39.847
Listen carefully.Here's how it's going to work.

06:39.951 --> 06:41.366
In today's challenge,
all of you will be

06:41.470 --> 06:43.403
working with these wood planks.

06:43.506 --> 06:45.197
Cedar and hickory.

06:45.301 --> 06:48.131
Many different types ofprotein can be cooked to wood.

06:48.235 --> 06:51.721
But there's one type that reallybenefits from this technique.

06:51.825 --> 06:56.277
And that is--

06:57.244 --> 06:58.072
ALL: Fish.

06:58.176 --> 06:59.660
That's right.
You got it.

06:59.764 --> 07:01.041
Yes.

07:01.144 --> 07:04.872
There you have a beautifulwahoo, an incredible salmon,

07:04.976 --> 07:07.116
cod, and barramundi.

07:07.219 --> 07:09.981
Now, you will be
working in pairs.

07:10.084 --> 07:13.329
And one person from eachteam will be cooking alone.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.711
So decide who's going
to pair up with who

07:15.814 --> 07:17.091
and who's on their own.

07:17.195 --> 07:19.197
I think the smartest thingis to let Van cook alone.

07:19.300 --> 07:20.232
- That all right?
- Yeah.

07:20.336 --> 07:22.027
- I want to cook salmon.
- Want to do it?

07:22.131 --> 07:22.614
Yeah.

07:22.718 --> 07:23.546
We'll do wahoo.

07:23.650 --> 07:24.478
You want to do
cod or barramundi?

07:24.582 --> 07:25.652
- Barramundi.
- OK.

07:25.755 --> 07:26.549
We'll do cod.

07:26.653 --> 07:27.757
Blue team, all good.

07:27.861 --> 07:28.724
Everybody on the same page.

07:29.966 --> 07:30.933
I'll do salmon.

07:31.036 --> 07:31.865
Barbie and I decided--

07:31.968 --> 07:32.969
I called salmon.

07:33.073 --> 07:34.177
- Jesus.
- OK.

07:34.281 --> 07:35.627
We said it before you did.

07:35.731 --> 07:36.904
This is what I've
learned about Elise.

07:37.008 --> 07:38.872
When she wants
something, she takes it.

07:38.975 --> 07:39.907
I'll cook alone.

07:40.011 --> 07:40.839
All right.

07:40.943 --> 07:42.047
Fine, you can cook alone.

07:42.151 --> 07:43.359
You know what, Elise?

07:43.463 --> 07:44.636
Take your stupid salmon.

07:44.740 --> 07:46.189
A fish is a fish is a fish.

07:46.293 --> 07:48.813
I'm confident enough to cookanything that I have to cook.

07:48.916 --> 07:49.745
Follow me.

07:49.848 --> 07:50.746
Oh, we're cooking outside?

07:50.849 --> 07:51.643
Oh, we are.

07:51.747 --> 07:52.955
See those amazing pits?

07:53.058 --> 07:56.406
You'll each cook your fishover that incredible flame.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.374
I'm ready to burn, burn, burn.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.962
I got OG Giovanni on my side.

08:00.065 --> 08:00.963
Oh yeah.

08:01.066 --> 08:02.999
I know he can
cook on a hot rock.

08:03.103 --> 08:05.036
He can cook on wood,because they might not have

08:05.139 --> 08:08.695
had gas grills when he started.

08:08.798 --> 08:09.696
Right.

08:09.799 --> 08:11.180
Are you ready to
dance with the fire?

08:11.283 --> 08:12.112
Yes, chef.

08:12.215 --> 08:14.355
45 minutes starts now.

08:14.459 --> 08:15.529
Let's go.

08:15.633 --> 08:17.497
NARRATOR: In today'splank cooking challenge--

08:17.600 --> 08:18.877

08:21.708 --> 08:22.502

08:24.573 --> 08:25.608
Yes, that's perfect.

08:25.712 --> 08:27.472
NARRATOR: Each will use
their choice of fish--

08:27.576 --> 08:28.646
Pesto.

08:28.749 --> 08:29.750
Do you want to do apesto on top of the fish?

08:29.854 --> 08:31.338
We'll rub it.
We'll rub it, OK?

08:31.441 --> 08:32.408
NARRATOR: --type of plank--

08:32.512 --> 08:33.892
Are we all using
hickory, guys?

08:33.996 --> 08:34.962
I'm going to use cedar.

08:35.066 --> 08:36.792
NARRATOR: --and fresh
seasonal produce--

08:36.895 --> 08:38.690
OK, we got a lot of earthygoing on here, though.

08:39.691 --> 08:40.727
Yeah.

08:40.830 --> 08:43.350
NARRATOR: --to create
a tasty fish platter.

08:43.453 --> 08:45.179
Hey, Van, what are
you going to make?

08:45.283 --> 08:48.182
Going to do a play
on nicoise salad.

08:48.286 --> 08:49.252
Nicoise salad?

08:49.356 --> 08:50.633
Yeah.

08:50.737 --> 08:52.083
You got eggs in
the nicoise salad?

08:52.186 --> 08:54.119
Yeah.

08:54.223 --> 08:55.086
Are you boiling your eggs?

08:55.189 --> 08:56.328
Yeah.

08:56.432 --> 08:57.985
I know it's a little riskydoing hard boiled eggs

08:58.089 --> 09:00.540
over open fire, Chef Jocky,but don't worry about it.

09:00.643 --> 09:01.989
I've never seen eggs
cooked in a barbecue.

09:02.093 --> 09:03.439
It's a first for me.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.509
I'm an all star, baby.

09:04.613 --> 09:06.131
I got this.

09:06.235 --> 09:07.961
10 minutes gone, guys.

09:08.064 --> 09:09.479
Get your fish on.
- Oh, shit.

09:09.583 --> 09:10.377
What?

09:10.480 --> 09:11.274
Here, move that.

09:11.378 --> 09:12.448
I got to get mine over there.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.346
Getting our planks
in the fire to make

09:14.450 --> 09:17.660
sure everybody's stuff fit,you have to work with the fire.

09:17.764 --> 09:18.937
It's a dance.

09:19.041 --> 09:21.595
It's like dancing the merenguewith a beautiful woman.

09:21.699 --> 09:22.872
Can you move it
to be right here?

09:22.976 --> 09:23.770
Yeah, if you don't mind.

09:23.873 --> 09:26.289
I've got to put this fish on.

09:26.393 --> 09:27.187
Coming around.

09:30.535 --> 09:32.123
Ben, I'm putting ours alittle bit lower in there.

09:32.226 --> 09:33.262
OK.

09:33.365 --> 09:34.643
I want to get a lot
of that smoke flavor.

09:34.746 --> 09:35.540
Yes.

09:35.644 --> 09:36.645
Just over 12 minutes to go.

09:36.748 --> 09:38.923
Got to get that wood hot, guys.

09:39.026 --> 09:40.890
You can drop the wood
into embers as well.

09:40.994 --> 09:42.167
- Yeah.
- Yes, Chef.

09:42.271 --> 09:43.375
Just be careful, please.

09:43.479 --> 09:45.343
Can everybody just
like be really careful.

09:45.446 --> 09:46.896
I have a pile of beets
here in the embers.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.726
You're going to have
to put more underneath.

09:48.829 --> 09:49.727
Don't suffocate it.

09:49.830 --> 09:50.866
It needs to catch.

09:50.969 --> 09:52.592
There's not enough fire
there to cook anything.

09:52.695 --> 09:55.042
Chef Ramsay put me on the RedTeam because he believes in me,

09:55.146 --> 09:57.424
and he knows that I can takethe Red Team to victory.

09:57.527 --> 09:59.046
You're going to
suffocate it if you put

09:59.150 --> 10:00.427
that many coals on top of it.

10:00.530 --> 10:03.326
We need more fire.

10:03.430 --> 10:04.638
Josh.

10:04.742 --> 10:06.329
Oh, what happened there.

10:06.433 --> 10:07.710
Oh my goodness.

10:07.814 --> 10:08.608
What's wrong?

10:08.711 --> 10:10.368
He just smothered our fire.

10:10.471 --> 10:12.301
He's going to tank our team.

10:12.404 --> 10:13.647
Josh, what happened?

10:13.751 --> 10:15.097
Josh has just
put the fire out.

10:15.200 --> 10:15.994
Oh my god.

10:24.485 --> 10:25.970
You're going to
suffocate it if you put

10:26.073 --> 10:27.385
that many coals on top of it.

10:27.488 --> 10:30.319
We need more fire.

10:30.422 --> 10:31.596
Josh.

10:31.700 --> 10:33.218
Oh, what happened there?

10:33.322 --> 10:34.254
Oh my goodness.

10:34.357 --> 10:35.186
What's wrong?

10:35.289 --> 10:37.740
He just smothered our fire.

10:37.844 --> 10:38.983
Josh has just
put the fire out.

10:39.086 --> 10:40.536
Josh just put the fire out.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.125
Cooking over an open fire 101.

10:43.228 --> 10:44.333
Let me finish.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.230
No, I got it.

10:45.334 --> 10:48.751
White, hot coals.

10:48.855 --> 10:50.788
Barbie, did you fix that fire?

10:50.891 --> 10:52.306
I've almost got fire.
We're almost there.

10:52.410 --> 10:53.204
Awesome.

10:53.307 --> 10:55.793
This just takes time.

10:55.896 --> 10:58.312
I need to stoke the
fire for the whole team

10:58.416 --> 11:01.730
because Josh ruined the
fire for the whole team.

11:01.833 --> 11:02.627
We're good.

11:02.731 --> 11:03.524
Thank you.

11:03.628 --> 11:04.733
You're welcome.

11:04.836 --> 11:07.287
Back home, I grillbetter than a man grills,

11:07.390 --> 11:09.841
but I'm not feeling
the fire pit at all.

11:09.945 --> 11:11.118
Oh my gosh.

11:11.222 --> 11:12.741
I don't know what the fuckto do with this stuff.

11:12.844 --> 11:14.639
Oh my god, I cannot take this.

11:14.743 --> 11:15.778
30 seconds remaining.

11:15.882 --> 11:16.779
Come on.

11:16.883 --> 11:18.885
This is the most
stressful shit.

11:18.988 --> 11:20.058
Smear it on.
CHEF RAMSAY: 10.

11:20.162 --> 11:20.990

11:21.094 --> 11:21.957

CHEF RAMSAY: 9.

11:22.060 --> 11:23.061
That one's perfect.
CHEF RAMSAY: 8.

11:23.165 --> 11:24.200
I need zest.
I need zest.

11:24.304 --> 11:26.962
CHEF RAMSAY: 7, 6, 5.

11:27.065 --> 11:28.032
Oh my god.

11:28.135 --> 11:32.346
CHEF RAMSAY: 4, 3,
2, 1, and stop, guys.

11:32.450 --> 11:33.762
High five, girl.

11:33.865 --> 11:34.866
Nice job, guys.

11:34.970 --> 11:36.005
Good job.

11:36.109 --> 11:39.353
That was the moststressful shit of my life.

11:39.457 --> 11:41.770
Now, I've arranged
for one of the country's

11:41.873 --> 11:46.498
plank cooking experts tohelp me judge this challenge.

11:46.602 --> 11:50.019
Please welcome Chef Ben Ford.

11:50.123 --> 11:53.160
Oh, wow.

11:53.264 --> 11:54.575
I am so excited.

11:54.679 --> 11:58.821
That is the son of Han Solo.

11:58.925 --> 11:59.995
Welcome back to
Hell's Kitchen.

12:00.098 --> 12:01.444
Good to see you, Chef.

12:01.548 --> 12:02.825
This man knows,
as well as I do,

12:02.929 --> 12:04.551
some of the best foodanywhere in this country right

12:04.654 --> 12:05.897
now is cooked outside.

12:06.001 --> 12:07.002
Absolutely.

12:07.105 --> 12:08.762
It's really about giving
up your inhibitions

12:08.866 --> 12:10.177
and trusting your instincts.

12:10.281 --> 12:11.972
Love that.

12:12.076 --> 12:15.631
Listen carefully, Chef Ben andI will be deciding which dishes

12:15.735 --> 12:17.598
are deserving of a point.

12:17.702 --> 12:21.568
Let's begin with thebattle of the cod, please.

12:21.671 --> 12:23.777
Michelle and Jennifer
and Robyn and Nick.

12:23.881 --> 12:24.674
Let's go.

12:24.778 --> 12:25.641
Let's go, girl.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.538
Let's go!

12:27.919 --> 12:29.231
I'm from New England.

12:29.334 --> 12:31.198
Me and this cod, you know, we'relike brother and sister here.

12:31.302 --> 12:32.613
Drop off your dish
and step back, please.

12:32.717 --> 12:33.511
Thank you.

12:33.614 --> 12:34.546
I know how to cook with it.

12:34.650 --> 12:37.377
I use it all the
time, so we got this.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.689
Michelle and Jennifer,describe your dish, please.

12:39.793 --> 12:42.037
So we have a black
cod that's seasoned

12:42.140 --> 12:44.004
with some Mediterranean spices.

12:44.108 --> 12:46.524
We also have some
charcoal eggplant.

12:46.627 --> 12:48.077
The fish is
seasoned beautifully.

12:48.181 --> 12:50.252
I would have held back alittle on the vinaigrette

12:50.355 --> 12:51.494
on the eggplant.

12:51.598 --> 12:53.324
Let those natural flavors,that smoky flavor,

12:53.427 --> 12:55.775
come out a little bitmore, but the Mediterranean

12:55.878 --> 12:56.672
flavors are good.

12:56.776 --> 12:57.569
Interesting start.

13:00.331 --> 13:01.815
So it's my first challengewith the Blue Team,

13:01.919 --> 13:03.852
and I'm going to show themthat I'm here to fight

13:03.955 --> 13:05.198
and I'm here to play.

13:05.301 --> 13:07.787
They should be happy to
have me instead of Josh.

13:07.890 --> 13:09.374
Robyn and Nick,describe the dish, please.

13:09.478 --> 13:11.929
Chef, we have
chimichurri basted cod.

13:12.032 --> 13:14.414
We used the hickory wood,and then there is a fresh out

13:14.517 --> 13:16.209
of smoked oranges and fennel.

13:18.936 --> 13:20.454
He's really enjoying it.

13:20.558 --> 13:22.491
The smoke's nice
on that because it's

13:22.594 --> 13:23.561
not too overpowering.

13:23.664 --> 13:24.527
Thank you, Chef?

13:24.631 --> 13:25.666
Fish is pretty
close to perfect.

13:25.770 --> 13:26.564
Nice job.

13:26.667 --> 13:28.014
Thank you, Chef.

13:28.117 --> 13:30.016
I think I'm going to have togive a point to the Blue Team.

13:30.119 --> 13:31.258
Damn.

13:32.501 --> 13:34.158
Team Gay.

13:34.261 --> 13:36.885
Whoa, Team Gay, killing it.

13:36.988 --> 13:38.610
NARRATOR: While the BlueTeam takes an early lead--

13:38.714 --> 13:39.508
Wow.

13:39.611 --> 13:40.509
Both are beautiful.

13:40.612 --> 13:41.751
CHEF RAMSAY: Amanda

13:41.855 --> 13:44.893

13:44.996 --> 13:45.825

13:45.928 --> 13:47.516
Amanda, describe
your dish, please.

13:47.619 --> 13:51.969
We have a cedar smoked
wahoo with leek ash.

13:52.072 --> 13:53.763
The fish just perfect.

13:53.867 --> 13:57.595
I really, really like the factthat you used this leek ash.

13:57.698 --> 13:58.527
Very good dish.

13:58.630 --> 13:59.769
Thank you, Chef.

13:59.873 --> 14:02.255
The son of Solo loves my food.

14:02.358 --> 14:05.051
The force is so
with me right now.

14:05.154 --> 14:07.881
NARRATOR: After a strongshowing from Amanda and Barbie,

14:07.985 --> 14:10.573
Jared and Benjamin hope toimpress with their hickory

14:10.677 --> 14:12.403
smoked wahoo and salsa verde.

14:12.506 --> 14:14.336
You got that balance
right with the acidity.

14:14.439 --> 14:15.302
Delicious.

14:15.406 --> 14:17.580
The flavor of the
wood is perfect.

14:18.581 --> 14:19.375
Thank you, Chef.

14:19.479 --> 14:22.447
This is a tough one.

14:22.551 --> 14:23.966
I've got to give a point each.- A point each.

14:24.070 --> 14:24.864
Well done.

14:24.967 --> 14:25.830
Good job, girls.

14:25.934 --> 14:27.556
Nice job, guys.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.523
You guys all remember
how I feel about ties,

14:29.627 --> 14:31.491
it's like kissing your sister.

14:31.594 --> 14:33.320
You don't win, you don't lose.

14:33.424 --> 14:35.529
It's just fucking awkward.

14:35.633 --> 14:38.912
NARRATOR: Next up is Dana andJosh's cedar smoked barramundi

14:39.016 --> 14:40.431
with poblano vinaigrette.

14:40.534 --> 14:41.708
Delicious.

14:41.811 --> 14:43.883
Very beautiful piece offish that you cooked there.

14:43.986 --> 14:46.713
NARRATOR: Against Van's cedarsmoked barramundi and niscious

14:46.816 --> 14:47.852
salad.

14:47.956 --> 14:49.371
Smart idea with these
niscious, boiling eggs

14:49.474 --> 14:50.406
in the fire pit.

14:50.510 --> 14:52.408
The eggs are
perfectly cooked for me.

14:52.512 --> 14:54.410
Thank you.

14:54.514 --> 14:55.653
I'm going to give
them both a point.

14:58.449 --> 15:00.037
Great, another tie.

15:00.140 --> 15:01.486
Hey, sis, come on over.

15:04.662 --> 15:06.353
NARRATOR: The Blue
Team leads 3 to 2

15:06.457 --> 15:09.563
and the Red Team's fate nowlies in the hands of Elise

15:09.667 --> 15:12.842
and her cedar grilledsalmon and mustard aioli.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.810
I was very unsure
about the firepit,

15:14.914 --> 15:17.468
but I'm very certain thatI know how to cook fish,

15:17.571 --> 15:18.572
so I'm not worried.

15:18.676 --> 15:19.849
I'm going to nail this.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.059
I really like
this aioli on top.

15:22.162 --> 15:23.923
The fish is
cooked beautifully.

15:24.026 --> 15:25.510
Thank you, Chef.

15:25.614 --> 15:28.203
NARRATOR: As Elise's dishreceives high praise,

15:28.306 --> 15:30.239
it is up to Milly and
Giovanni's hickory

15:30.343 --> 15:32.621
smoked salmon with
brandy glaze to seal

15:32.724 --> 15:34.485
the win for the Blue Team.

15:34.588 --> 15:38.351
I wouldn't put brandy ontop of a fish personally.

15:38.454 --> 15:41.043
I don't love the glaze.

15:42.044 --> 15:42.838
Give us the point.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.805
Chef Ford, come on.

15:44.909 --> 15:47.291
The Red Team needs to
pull out a win today.

15:47.394 --> 15:49.845
I'm going to give one
point to the Red Team.

15:49.949 --> 15:50.742
Thank you.

15:50.846 --> 15:54.056
Thank you, Chef.

15:54.160 --> 15:54.954
No pressure.

15:55.057 --> 15:56.576
We are all tied up.

15:56.679 --> 15:59.096
Oh my god, this is ridiculous.

15:59.199 --> 16:00.580
Another tie.

16:00.683 --> 16:02.099
I'm out of sisters.

16:02.202 --> 16:04.929
Listen carefully, ChefBen and I will break the tie

16:05.033 --> 16:07.449
with the best dish overall.

16:07.552 --> 16:11.211
The two best dishes ofthe day was Elise's salmon

16:11.315 --> 16:12.972
and Robyn and Nick's cod.

16:13.075 --> 16:15.319
Are we going to the Blue Team?

16:15.422 --> 16:17.977
Please, please, please,
I'm praying to God.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.599
I'm praying to my magic rock.

16:19.702 --> 16:20.496
My fingers are crossed.

16:20.600 --> 16:21.428
My toes are crossed.

16:21.532 --> 16:22.464
Everything's crossed right now.

16:22.567 --> 16:24.086
Or are we going
to the Red Team?

16:24.190 --> 16:27.607
Oh my god, I'm like sweatinghere and biting my nails.

16:27.710 --> 16:29.505
It's so close that I
can taste this victory.

16:32.439 --> 16:37.479
I'm going to give it to theBlue Team and Robyn and Nick.

16:37.582 --> 16:38.652
Yeah, Robyn and Nick.

16:38.756 --> 16:39.757
Yes, let's go.

16:39.860 --> 16:40.654
Nice shit.

16:40.758 --> 16:43.036
You already know.

16:43.140 --> 16:44.969
Shout out to the
universe for putting

16:45.073 --> 16:49.767
Josh on the Red Team, definitelythe trade of the century.

16:49.870 --> 16:51.286
A big thank you
to Chef Ben, please.

16:51.389 --> 16:52.563
- Thanks, chef, very much.- Thanks, chef!

16:53.909 --> 16:55.152
Thank you.

16:55.255 --> 16:57.326
I can't believe we lost,but Ben Ford, our guest judge

16:57.430 --> 16:58.603
was awesome.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.057
Love my light sabers.

17:04.161 --> 17:06.301
Today, first
time in the history

17:06.404 --> 17:09.442
of this competition,
both winners and losers

17:09.545 --> 17:11.237
will be going to the same place.

17:11.340 --> 17:12.410
Oh my god.

17:12.514 --> 17:13.687
Oh, snap.

17:13.791 --> 17:17.139
However, you will havevery different experiences.

17:17.243 --> 17:19.038
Oh, god.

17:19.141 --> 17:21.454
You'll be traveling to
an incredible property

17:21.557 --> 17:25.872
nestled in the Californiafoothills, Apex Ranch.

17:25.975 --> 17:30.394
Blue Team, you'll be traversingthe olive groves on horseback.

17:30.497 --> 17:32.223
Awesome.

17:32.327 --> 17:33.086
That's cool.

17:35.951 --> 17:37.194
I ain't never been on a horse.

17:37.297 --> 17:39.023
Only time I see
horses is when cops

17:39.127 --> 17:42.647
are riding them during riots,so this about to be crazy.

17:42.751 --> 17:43.752
Congratulations.

17:43.855 --> 17:44.994
Up to the dorms and get changed.

17:46.168 --> 17:47.342
Let's go.

17:47.445 --> 17:49.309
I'm so excited to get outthere on the ranch, baby.

17:49.413 --> 17:50.552
This is like being home again.

17:50.655 --> 17:52.450
About to ride some horses.

17:52.554 --> 17:54.487
About to go get back
in the saddle, boy.

17:58.629 --> 18:02.391
Red Team, while the BlueTeam will be riding horses,

18:02.495 --> 18:06.464
let's just say you're goingto have a rather crappy day.

18:06.568 --> 18:09.467
Fuck off.

18:09.571 --> 18:10.848
We're gonna have
to clean up poop?

18:13.644 --> 18:14.472
Head to the patio.

18:14.576 --> 18:15.404
Let's go.

18:15.508 --> 18:16.647
I'm pissed off at Josh.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.132
He totally bombed
us with our fire,

18:19.236 --> 18:22.031
and we're going to be stuckwith him until we lose.

18:22.135 --> 18:23.861
Fuck Josh, man.

18:23.964 --> 18:26.312
You went and dumped cold
coals on a hot fire.

18:26.415 --> 18:28.245
We needed fire,
and there wasn't any,

18:28.348 --> 18:29.694
so coals create fire.

18:29.798 --> 18:31.040
Not cold coals.

18:31.144 --> 18:32.801
Listen, how do
you bully everyone?

18:32.904 --> 18:36.080
You're just a bully.

18:36.184 --> 18:37.633
- I'm not a bully.
- Of course, you are.

18:37.737 --> 18:38.772
Look at you.
Sit down.

18:38.876 --> 18:40.360
I'm not a bully, and
nobody on this team

18:40.464 --> 18:42.155
would agree with you
in saying I'm a bully.

18:42.259 --> 18:43.881
He's going there.

18:43.984 --> 18:45.917
Men that are
soft like Josh tend

18:46.021 --> 18:48.575
to think that strong womenlike myself are bullies,

18:48.679 --> 18:50.405
but it has nothing to do
with me being a bully.

18:50.508 --> 18:51.854
It has everything to
do with me telling you

18:51.958 --> 18:53.201
we're not going to
put up with this shit.

18:53.304 --> 18:54.719
OK, this is how
the Red Team works.

18:54.823 --> 18:55.858
Oh, that's not how life works.

18:55.962 --> 18:57.274
We point out what
went wrong and we

18:57.377 --> 18:59.276
discuss it so that we don't makethe same mistake over and over.

18:59.379 --> 19:00.794
- You're not a bully?
- We avoid that.

19:00.898 --> 19:01.726
Sit down.

19:01.830 --> 19:03.245
Did to get a dose of HGH today?

19:03.349 --> 19:04.591
Will you just take
a seat, please?

19:04.695 --> 19:05.592
ELISE: HGH?
- Yeah.

19:05.696 --> 19:07.215
Take a seat and relax a minute.

19:07.318 --> 19:08.630
Oh, fuck.

19:08.733 --> 19:11.046
Elise is all about taking theblame and pushing it on others.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.358
Elise is a master manipulator.

19:12.461 --> 19:13.255
But you know what?

19:13.359 --> 19:14.394
I see right through it.

19:14.498 --> 19:16.638
Say something once,
and we'll move on.

19:16.741 --> 19:19.123
Know that I heard you
all and cut the shit.

19:19.227 --> 19:20.020
Yikes.

19:20.124 --> 19:21.021
Cut the shit?

19:21.125 --> 19:21.919
Are we done?

19:22.022 --> 19:22.816
Are we over it?

19:32.481 --> 19:34.966
I don't remember the lasttime I was on a school bus.

19:35.070 --> 19:35.898
This sticks.

19:36.002 --> 19:37.314
They're here, David.

19:37.417 --> 19:38.349
A bunch of prisoners.

19:38.453 --> 19:39.350
Look at them.

19:39.454 --> 19:40.282
Hi.

19:40.386 --> 19:41.490
Welcome to Apex Ranch.

19:41.594 --> 19:43.527
We've got about 27 horses here.

19:43.630 --> 19:44.804
This is what it's all about.

19:44.907 --> 19:46.150
Oh, god.

19:46.254 --> 19:47.047
Oh, boy.

19:47.151 --> 19:49.705
What is in store for us today?

19:49.809 --> 19:54.020
A giant pile of steaming poop.

19:54.123 --> 19:56.333
Oh, man.

19:56.436 --> 19:57.782
We got a lot of work to do.

19:57.886 --> 19:59.646
We've got to get all
this manure moved.

19:59.750 --> 20:03.236
OK, get on it.

20:03.340 --> 20:05.411
It's good for your skin.

20:05.514 --> 20:06.412
Oh my god.

20:06.515 --> 20:07.482
This is disgusting.

20:07.585 --> 20:08.828
It smells so bad.

20:08.931 --> 20:10.761
I don't even want to talk,because I feel like the smell

20:10.864 --> 20:11.969
is getting in my mouth.

20:12.072 --> 20:14.005
Oh.

20:14.109 --> 20:14.937
Oh my god.

20:15.041 --> 20:16.111
[laughing]

20:16.215 --> 20:17.043
Hot and steamy over here.

20:17.146 --> 20:18.286
Hot and steamy.

20:18.389 --> 20:19.701
I have been on
Hell's Kitchen, have

20:19.804 --> 20:26.673
done many shitty punishments,but this one is the shittiest.

20:26.777 --> 20:27.985
Oh, it's so squishy.

20:28.088 --> 20:29.607
I'm literally stuck.

20:29.711 --> 20:31.575
Get out of there.

20:31.678 --> 20:34.819
I'm gonna fall down.

20:34.923 --> 20:36.752
The worst is the
horses laughing at us.

20:46.693 --> 20:48.557
Yeehaw.

20:48.661 --> 20:49.903
I want to ride
in a convertible.

20:50.007 --> 20:52.630
Michelle, that pile of
shit is bigger than you.

20:57.186 --> 20:58.222
Oh, yeah.

20:58.326 --> 20:59.568
Now we're talking.

20:59.672 --> 21:00.466
Nice shirts, guys.

21:00.569 --> 21:01.777
Thanks.

21:01.881 --> 21:03.262
You're all matching.

21:03.365 --> 21:05.609
Welcome to beautiful ApexRanch, a beautiful day

21:05.712 --> 21:07.404
to go trail riding.

21:07.507 --> 21:09.302
Oh, yeah, sure, a lasso.

21:09.406 --> 21:11.235
Yeah, lasso the Italian guy.

21:11.339 --> 21:13.099
I see how this is.

21:13.202 --> 21:15.481
We're pretty much going tosaddle up and get on out here.

21:15.584 --> 21:16.792
Who's the big guy?

21:16.896 --> 21:18.207
Milly.

21:18.311 --> 21:19.657
You're going to be over thereon the white and black one.

21:19.761 --> 21:21.141
- Oh, there you go.
- He's a big baby.

21:21.245 --> 21:22.384
He's a lovey dovey.

21:22.488 --> 21:25.111
Listen, mine was like awoolly mammoth out there.

21:25.214 --> 21:26.319
I'll walk you.

21:26.423 --> 21:28.287
I'll feed you an apple,but I just wanted to chill

21:28.390 --> 21:30.392
with the little horses, man.

21:30.496 --> 21:32.946
This one right here got
like weave for days.

21:33.050 --> 21:36.467
They take that to my
hood, it's a wrap.

21:36.571 --> 21:39.815
Oh, we're set, huh?

21:39.919 --> 21:40.747
You guys good?

21:40.851 --> 21:43.198
Yeehaw.

21:43.302 --> 21:46.235
ELISE: Damn, that's thebiggest horse I've ever seen.

21:46.339 --> 21:47.306
That's a nice horse.

21:47.409 --> 21:50.067
ELISE: It's a beautiful horse.

21:50.170 --> 21:50.964
No.

21:51.068 --> 21:52.414
Milly looks so scared.

21:52.518 --> 21:53.312
This is great.

21:53.415 --> 21:54.692
Really nice back here.

21:54.796 --> 21:56.591
Yeah, you guys
got a nice backyard.

21:56.694 --> 21:59.007
I'm having the time
of my life right now.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.905
I feel like John Wayne.

22:01.009 --> 22:04.564
I'm here to slay somedishes in Hell's Kitchen.

22:08.119 --> 22:10.812
Now, what is he doing?

22:10.915 --> 22:14.022
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.403
You're not scared?

22:15.506 --> 22:16.645
You know how to
ride a horse, huh?

22:19.234 --> 22:20.028
Slow down.

22:20.131 --> 22:22.858
You're good.

22:22.962 --> 22:24.860
[SINGING] On this
farm, I'm cleaning shit.

22:24.964 --> 22:29.278
E-I-E-I-O. I'm a rancher now.

22:29.382 --> 22:31.350
Hey, Josh, you want tohelp me get this thing up?

22:31.453 --> 22:33.317
What happened?

22:33.421 --> 22:35.215
Well, because
we're getting tired.

22:35.319 --> 22:36.424
Because why?

22:36.527 --> 22:37.735
You're getting tiredbecause you're not doing it

22:37.839 --> 22:39.392
the way is efficient.

22:39.496 --> 22:40.497
Why do you have to be a dick?

22:40.600 --> 22:41.739
I'm not being a dick.

22:41.843 --> 22:43.638
I seriously just asked
you for fucking help.

22:43.741 --> 22:44.880
I'm tired of these girls.

22:44.984 --> 22:46.434
You know, just because
I'm the only guy doesn't

22:46.537 --> 22:47.987
mean I have to do all the work.

22:48.090 --> 22:49.229
You don't want to
help just say no.

22:49.333 --> 22:50.541
You want my help?
You want my help?

22:50.645 --> 22:51.922
All I said was
will you please--

22:52.025 --> 22:53.164
Put that in the barrel.
Come here.

22:53.268 --> 22:54.373
Oh, want me to write itdown so you have directions?

22:54.476 --> 22:55.615
Are you fucking kidding me?

22:55.719 --> 22:57.272
Don't talk to me like that.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.723
I will tell you right
now, I might be little,

22:59.826 --> 23:02.173
but I'm not the personthat you talk to like that.

23:02.277 --> 23:03.554
You will respect me.

23:03.658 --> 23:04.452
Just go do it.

23:04.555 --> 23:05.729
You're a fucking idiot.

23:05.832 --> 23:07.524
You are the stupidest person--- What's wrong with you?

23:07.627 --> 23:08.421
I've ever met.

23:08.525 --> 23:09.560
My god.

23:09.664 --> 23:12.183
One thing you won't go
and do is disrespect me.

23:12.287 --> 23:13.564
And I might be 4'
8", but you ain't

23:13.668 --> 23:15.117
gonna talk to me like that.

23:15.221 --> 23:16.636
Amanda, I got your back.

23:16.740 --> 23:17.810
Shoot.

23:17.913 --> 23:19.674
I wouldn't put up with
the disrespect neither.

23:19.777 --> 23:21.365
- You're an idiot.
- Why are you yelling?

23:21.469 --> 23:22.815
This is why none of
your team wanted you.

23:22.918 --> 23:24.437
Amanda, you got moreshit coming out your mouth

23:24.541 --> 23:25.611
than I have in this pile.

23:25.714 --> 23:26.474
You're an idiot.

23:33.653 --> 23:34.999
I'm taking these
dirty clothes off.

23:35.103 --> 23:35.897
Show time.

23:40.867 --> 23:41.661
I'm sure.

23:46.942 --> 23:48.875
He's pretty pissed at us,like we did something to him.

23:51.671 --> 23:52.672
God help me.

23:52.776 --> 23:54.122
It's a very difficult
situation to be

23:54.225 --> 23:55.434
in when the Red Team
doesn't want you

23:55.537 --> 23:56.711
and the Blue Team
doesn't want you.

23:56.814 --> 23:58.989
And you know, there's
no Green Team to go to,

23:59.092 --> 24:00.369
so I just feel like I'm alone.

24:05.409 --> 24:06.962
But tonight is about
proving to myself

24:07.066 --> 24:09.206
that I deserve to be here.

24:09.309 --> 24:10.759
- Wellington's glazed?
- Yes, Chef.

24:10.863 --> 24:11.726
Yeah, good.

24:11.829 --> 24:13.141

27:06.417 --> 27:07.764

27:16.358 --> 27:18.050
Aye-yi-yi.

27:18.153 --> 27:19.741
Is that too dark?

27:19.845 --> 27:20.846
I think so.

27:20.949 --> 27:23.365
At this stage, if you
can't fry something,

27:23.469 --> 27:29.130
you need to go get a job
at like a law office.

27:29.233 --> 27:31.511

I have to refire
the fish, Chef.

27:40.969 --> 27:41.763
I'm fine, Chef.

27:41.867 --> 27:43.109
Come on, man, please?

27:43.213 --> 27:44.248
Yeah, I'm trying.

27:44.352 --> 27:46.112

27:48.943 --> 27:49.909
I'm working on it hard.

27:50.013 --> 27:51.877
I'm here to talk the
talk, walk the walk.

31:41.589 --> 31:42.521
The babaganoush.

31:42.624 --> 31:43.694
Hey, who?

31:43.798 --> 31:45.110
The babaganoush.

31:45.213 --> 31:46.628
This my first time on garnish.

31:46.732 --> 31:48.078
Two brains are always
better than one.

31:48.182 --> 31:51.254
So now I'm basically justusing Nick as my other brain.

31:51.357 --> 31:54.050
Like Nick, do I got
all my shit, bro.

31:54.153 --> 31:55.465
Salad garlic for the
Wellington, right?

31:55.568 --> 31:56.500

I mean, the cream is
gonna start separating

32:04.474 --> 32:06.441
from the-- what is it?

32:06.545 --> 32:07.615
Cream from the crop?

32:07.718 --> 32:08.927
What is it?

32:09.030 --> 32:10.756
What's that saying?

32:10.859 --> 32:11.964
The cream of the crop.

32:12.068 --> 32:14.035
But does the cream, doesit separate from the crop?

32:14.139 --> 32:17.936
Milly, let me know when
I cut the Wellingtons.

32:22.112 --> 32:24.011

32:36.678 --> 32:37.714
One minute to the window.

32:37.817 --> 32:39.750
Milly, you need to
be ready when they are.

32:39.854 --> 32:40.648
Yes, Chef.

32:40.751 --> 32:41.925
You can't say I'm ready.

32:42.029 --> 32:43.237
That's not good for
your team, right?

32:43.340 --> 32:44.479
No, no.

39:18.528 --> 39:19.426
Let's go.

39:19.529 --> 39:20.461
I'm in the middle
of service, Josh.

39:20.565 --> 39:21.359
Sorry, Chef.

39:21.462 --> 39:22.463
I don't mean to waste your time.

39:22.567 --> 39:23.775
I wish you well.

39:25.397 --> 39:26.640
Front door.

39:26.743 --> 39:27.572
Goodnight.

39:31.783 --> 39:33.371
You don't ever want
to let Chef Ramsay down,

39:33.474 --> 39:35.096
but he knows I'm resilient.

39:35.200 --> 39:36.374
He knows I'm a fighter.

39:36.477 --> 39:39.791
He knows I have a bigheart, and I gave it my all.

39:39.894 --> 39:41.309
Although it didn't work
out, I know that Chef

39:41.413 --> 39:43.035
Ramsay still appreciates me.

39:43.139 --> 39:46.211
I wouldn't be surprisedif he called me up again.

39:46.314 --> 39:47.626
Bye.

39:47.730 --> 39:50.767
You know, not many people inthis world get second chances,

39:50.871 --> 39:53.632
but if anybody's going
to get a third chance,

39:53.736 --> 39:54.668
it would be me, right?

40:01.744 --> 40:03.470
Salmon, duck, lobster
Wellington, lamb.

40:03.573 --> 40:04.643
Last table, let's go.

40:04.747 --> 40:05.713
Yes, Chef.

40:05.817 --> 40:07.991
Blue Team, can we
focus on the last table?

40:08.095 --> 40:08.889
Yes, Chef.

40:08.992 --> 40:10.028
Come on, let's go.

40:10.131 --> 40:11.270
We've got this, guys.

40:11.374 --> 40:12.789
I'm basting chicken.

40:12.893 --> 40:14.273
Lobster Wellie garnish
is in the window.

40:14.377 --> 40:15.965
Walking Wellie
garnish to the window.

40:16.068 --> 40:17.587
Wellies walking.

40:17.691 --> 40:19.382
That better be my
lobster Wellington.

40:19.486 --> 40:20.659
That's beautiful.

40:20.763 --> 40:21.660
Walking salmon.

40:21.764 --> 40:24.076
Lamb to the window, Chef.

40:24.180 --> 40:25.699
Nick, I'm walking two
New York strips, OK?

40:25.802 --> 40:26.493
Walk.
Perfect.

40:26.596 --> 40:27.666
Thank you.
Walking strips.

40:27.770 --> 40:29.254
Walk halibut.
Walk halibut.

40:29.357 --> 40:30.945
That's the best lamb that'sgone out of this kitchen.

40:31.049 --> 40:32.084
Thank you, Chef.

40:32.188 --> 40:33.500
That looks really beautiful.

40:33.603 --> 40:35.053
Oh my gosh, that's so pretty.

40:35.156 --> 40:37.400
It's like the most perfecthalibut I've ever had.

40:37.504 --> 40:39.816
Hey, stoves off.

40:39.920 --> 40:40.852
Blue Team, shut down.

40:40.955 --> 40:41.749
Oui, Chef.

40:53.554 --> 40:55.142
Let's get one thing right.

40:55.245 --> 41:00.458
Josh ran out of
lifelines, so he's gone.

41:00.561 --> 41:02.908
Thank you.

41:03.012 --> 41:04.151
Red Team, you gonna miss him?

41:04.254 --> 41:05.324
No, Chef.

41:05.428 --> 41:06.809
Blue Team, you gonna
miss your old teammate?

41:06.912 --> 41:08.396
No, Chef.

41:08.500 --> 41:16.922
Tonight, the winning
team is the Blue Team.

41:17.026 --> 41:17.854
Fantastic.

41:17.958 --> 41:18.717
Thank you, Chef.

41:21.755 --> 41:23.377
And the Red Team.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.274
Yes.

41:29.072 --> 41:30.557
He scared me.

41:30.660 --> 41:31.972
Nobody's leaving.

41:32.075 --> 41:37.598
However, be prepared to adaptand prove to me that you are

41:37.702 --> 41:41.982
worthy to continue every day,every week, every service

41:42.085 --> 41:43.501
in this competition.

41:43.604 --> 41:44.398
Is that clear?

41:44.502 --> 41:45.779
Yes, Chef.

41:45.882 --> 41:46.676
Goodnight.

41:46.780 --> 41:48.471
Goodnight, Chef.

41:48.575 --> 41:50.197
Next thing we need
to do is start picking

41:50.300 --> 41:52.130
off those boys one by one.

41:52.233 --> 41:53.027
See you.

41:53.131 --> 41:54.063
Bye bye.

41:54.166 --> 41:55.029
Talk to you later.

41:55.133 --> 41:55.927
Go home.

41:56.030 --> 41:57.100
Nice job, guys.

41:57.204 --> 41:59.068
Tonight was definitely
not a perfect service,

41:59.171 --> 42:01.277
but at least I survived, andno one from the Blue Team

42:01.380 --> 42:02.174
went home.

42:02.278 --> 42:04.383
So whoo.

42:04.487 --> 42:07.041
Thank you, Jesus.

42:07.145 --> 42:08.249
Deuces, Josh.

42:08.353 --> 42:10.286
I can't deal with somebodywho sucks at cooking

42:10.389 --> 42:12.633
and has the nerve to be
rude and disrespectful.

42:12.737 --> 42:14.566
Listen, people need
to go, because there

42:14.670 --> 42:15.878
can only be one winner, duh.

42:21.815 --> 42:23.264
