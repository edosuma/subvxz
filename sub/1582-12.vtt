00:53.965 --> 00:55.132

01:01.072 --> 01:04.675
Mmm!

01:04.909 --> 01:05.942
Maggie?

01:05.977 --> 01:07.477
Maggie!

01:07.512 --> 01:09.012
Maggie?

01:09.046 --> 01:10.280
Maggie!

01:11.071 --> 01:12.405
Mmm!

01:19.580 --> 01:20.980
Mmm!

01:32.126 --> 01:33.693
Hmm...

01:33.727 --> 01:35.261
Maggie?

01:35.296 --> 01:36.262
Maggie!

01:36.297 --> 01:38.998
Hmm. Hey!

01:44.405 --> 01:45.938
Maggie!

02:00.421 --> 02:03.690
And it's for all
these reasons and more

02:03.724 --> 02:06.025
that the Kingdom of Moab

02:06.060 --> 02:08.961
is the least interesting
in the Bible.

02:08.996 --> 02:10.395
Amen.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.864
Amen! We're done!

02:13.634 --> 02:16.135
Allow me to introduce
our guest speaker

02:16.170 --> 02:18.571
from the ill-advised mission
in Indonesia,

02:18.605 --> 02:21.808
the Reverend Kartawijaya.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.578
I know how you feel, young man.
Huh?

02:25.612 --> 02:28.848
The children in my village
are just like you.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.918
One boy, named Sumadi,
never comes to church.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.219
He is always tying

02:33.253 --> 02:34.954
<i>the monkeys' tails together</i>

02:34.988 --> 02:36.923
<i>and yelling, "Tiger is gone,"</i>

02:36.957 --> 02:39.058
<i>when, in fact, tiger is there.</i>

02:39.093 --> 02:42.628
Hmm!
Unfortunately, Sumadi is sick now.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.897
What?!
Su-Sumadi has a problem?

02:44.932 --> 02:47.433
Sumadi and others
equally doe-eyed...

02:47.468 --> 02:49.469
need urgent medical treatment.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.538
After all, we are all
just children of Allah.

02:52.573 --> 02:55.875
I mean God.
Sorry. Recent convert.

02:55.909 --> 02:56.876
Poor Sumadi.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.112
Born in such a
terrible country.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.546
Now, wait a minute.

03:00.581 --> 03:01.848
But good news.

03:01.882 --> 03:05.084
To help him, we will now have
a second collection.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.788
Wasn't our sympathetic
nodding enough?

03:08.822 --> 03:10.089
Mom, can I have
some money?

03:10.124 --> 03:12.258
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm all out.

03:12.292 --> 03:15.461
I spent all I had lighting that
candle for Great Aunt Betty.

03:17.097 --> 03:20.199
I hope that wasn't somebody's
Aunt Betty or something.

03:20.234 --> 03:23.436
Dad, please?
For Sumadi?

03:23.470 --> 03:25.338
Sorry, son,
I only have 20s.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.572
And if God needs money,

03:26.607 --> 03:28.107
why doesn't he just
write another Bible?

03:28.142 --> 03:29.976
The first one sold
pretty well.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.344
Does anyone remember

03:31.378 --> 03:33.980
when it was considered
rude to talk in church?

03:34.014 --> 03:35.648
Pipe down, Ned.

03:37.151 --> 03:38.818
Please?

03:41.989 --> 03:43.189
All right, son,

03:43.223 --> 03:45.024
but you have to pay me back.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.128
Life is good.

03:49.163 --> 03:50.663
Do you have my money?
What?

03:50.697 --> 03:51.964
Do you have my money?

03:51.999 --> 03:53.266
How could I?

03:53.300 --> 03:54.634
Right, right, too soon.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.135
Do you have my money?

03:59.673 --> 04:01.207
Seriously,
do you have my money?

04:01.241 --> 04:02.975
Where's my money?

04:03.977 --> 04:04.644
Huh?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.351
Where's my money?

04:13.720 --> 04:15.922
Where's... my...

04:15.956 --> 04:18.757
mon... ey?

04:18.791 --> 04:20.358
It's been a rough patch, man.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.161
Hope you got something
to cheer me up.

04:22.196 --> 04:24.630
Well, there is one fun fact

04:24.665 --> 04:27.600
I've been saving
for an emergency situation.

04:27.634 --> 04:30.503
Did you know
there really was a Duncan Hines?

04:30.537 --> 04:32.738
Where's my money? Do you have
my money? Where is it?

04:32.773 --> 04:34.807
You know, if you had the money,
I'm right here.

04:34.842 --> 04:35.942
Do you have the money?

04:35.976 --> 04:37.276
Money-money-money-money-mon...

04:37.311 --> 04:40.913
Homer, quit
badgering the boy.

04:40.948 --> 04:44.217
Pressure's how you make
your beloved diamonds, Marge.

04:44.251 --> 04:46.118
I don't have any diamonds.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.954
Quit pressuring me!

04:49.957 --> 04:52.558
Money, money.
I need money!

04:52.593 --> 04:54.994
Would you eat
anything for money?

04:55.028 --> 04:56.529
I guess.
Who are you?

04:56.563 --> 04:59.432
School play.
<i>Damn Yankees.</i>

04:59.466 --> 05:01.634
Children of the playground!

05:02.769 --> 05:05.238
I will eat anything for money!

05:05.272 --> 05:06.472
Except money!

05:06.507 --> 05:09.709
I'll give you a quarter
if you eat my gum.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.246
I'll give you another
if you eat mine.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.415
Here's some orthodontic wax!

05:16.450 --> 05:17.917
And some cinnamon!

05:17.951 --> 05:19.418
Saint-John's-wort!

05:21.755 --> 05:23.256
And here's something
that'll make you

05:23.290 --> 05:25.525
forget about the
other stuff.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.293
<i>Ay caramba.</i>

05:28.962 --> 05:30.329
So, what else you got?

05:30.364 --> 05:31.831
All right, Simpson.

05:31.865 --> 05:36.669
20 big ones says you're not
messed-up enough to eat... this.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.707
No, Bart, no!

05:41.742 --> 05:43.643
Do it, and you'll
always be known

05:43.677 --> 05:45.878
as the kid who ate
the dead frog.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.147
Where's my money?

05:48.181 --> 05:49.282
Get my money!

05:49.316 --> 05:50.983
Money-money-money-money-money!

06:02.529 --> 06:04.330
Easiest money I ever...

06:05.732 --> 06:08.801
Son, by rights, I should be
playing banjo at your funeral.

06:08.835 --> 06:10.875
That frog was filled
to the gills with formaldehyde,

06:10.904 --> 06:14.073
a highly toxic poison.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.274
Here's your money, Dad.

06:15.309 --> 06:16.475
What?

06:16.510 --> 06:18.010
Did you owe me some money?

06:18.045 --> 06:20.646
And, Homer, here's
your bill for $4,000.

06:20.681 --> 06:21.781
D'oh!

06:21.815 --> 06:23.549
Where's my money?
You got my money?

06:23.584 --> 06:25.418
Where's my money?

06:25.452 --> 06:27.286
Seriously,
where's my money?

06:32.726 --> 06:36.829
Ew! It's the kid who
ate the dead frog!

06:41.802 --> 06:43.469
Herbivore!

06:43.503 --> 06:45.071
That's someone
who eats plants.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.974
I named the frog Herb.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.076
Even you won't
sit with me?

06:50.110 --> 06:52.445
Bart, if you sit here,
I'll be the boy

06:52.479 --> 06:55.247
who sat next to the boy
who ate the frog.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.950
And I'm already the boy
who shared a comb with a boy

06:57.985 --> 06:59.385
who threw up on the boy

06:59.419 --> 07:01.721
who wet his pants
at the winter carnival.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.323
P.S. I would've given you
the money.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.507
What's the matter,
frog in your throat?

07:21.541 --> 07:23.609
You're the ones
that paid me to eat it.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.911
All we hear is:
ribbit, ribbit!

07:30.050 --> 07:33.085
You said this was
a simple bullying job!

07:36.323 --> 07:38.457
Diggs and Freedom
at your service.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.026
Diggs is short
for Digby.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.628
Thanks. I'm the kid
that ate the frog.

07:42.663 --> 07:43.929
Oh, so you're the reason

07:43.964 --> 07:46.032
I had to dissect a Muppet
in biology today.

07:49.676 --> 07:51.865
Thanks for the help, man.
Oh, you're welcome.

07:51.890 --> 07:53.055
At least for me.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.924
There's no way to say
what the bird thinks.

07:54.958 --> 07:56.759
Or even <i>if</i> he thinks, really.

07:56.793 --> 07:57.860
Wait, wait, wait!

07:57.894 --> 07:59.228
Who the hell are you?

07:59.262 --> 08:01.030
I transferred here
a few months ago.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.265
To this school?
On purpose?

08:03.300 --> 08:05.067
Even after
Springfield Montessori opened

08:05.102 --> 08:06.736
across the street?

08:11.808 --> 08:13.743
That place is
really in your face.

08:13.777 --> 08:15.544
I like the lack
of attention.

08:15.579 --> 08:17.046
Especially in here.

08:25.555 --> 08:27.523
This school has a falconry club?

08:27.557 --> 08:28.791
No way.

08:28.825 --> 08:30.226
I resuscitated it.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.193
I'm president,
secretary treasurer

08:32.229 --> 08:33.596
and faculty advisor.

08:33.630 --> 08:35.765
That took a lot of
fancy paperwork.

08:35.799 --> 08:38.933
But it was worth it
to be left alone.

08:38.969 --> 08:40.436
Can I join?

08:40.470 --> 08:42.671
Hmm. I'll have to
check with Freedom.

08:43.807 --> 08:45.441
<i>Habemus Papam!</i>

08:45.475 --> 08:46.976
We have a poop!

08:47.010 --> 08:48.544
It's white.
You're in.

08:49.846 --> 08:53.883
Looks like the falconry club's
back from the dead.

08:53.917 --> 08:55.718
Can the Esperanto
Society be far behind?

08:55.752 --> 08:56.986
I mean...

08:57.020 --> 09:00.823
<i>Cu la Esperanto-Societo</i>
<i>esti multe malantau?</i>

09:00.857 --> 09:02.591
Two languages,

09:02.626 --> 09:04.760
and somehow no one
will talk to you.

09:04.795 --> 09:06.395
<i>Gi estas vera.</i>

09:06.430 --> 09:08.397
<i>Mi tre soleca.</i>
Loser.

09:08.432 --> 09:10.099
The first thing
to learn about falcons

09:10.133 --> 09:12.101
is how beautiful
they are in flight.

09:16.339 --> 09:19.008
Don't fret.
He'll be back.

09:19.042 --> 09:21.410
There's my
Sky Gramma!

09:21.445 --> 09:25.081
Bart's usually first in line
for Taco Night,

09:25.115 --> 09:27.283
but now he's <i>muy tarde.</i>

09:27.317 --> 09:29.418
Oh, is it all right
to say <i>"tarde"?</i>

09:29.453 --> 09:31.187
Mmm, hey, you've said
it twice, Marge--

09:31.221 --> 09:33.422
you're in pretty deep.

09:33.457 --> 09:34.423
Homer!

09:34.458 --> 09:36.325
Ten-minute rule!

09:36.359 --> 09:37.493
Lisa!

09:37.527 --> 09:39.495
What? A rule's a rule.

09:40.530 --> 09:42.498
There he is!

09:42.532 --> 09:45.134
Ah, he is just riding
that thermal!

09:45.168 --> 09:47.203
You were right about
watching him fly.

09:47.237 --> 09:48.571
I thought you'd get it.

09:48.605 --> 09:50.139
Seat backs
and tray tables, Bart.

09:50.173 --> 09:51.674
We're coming in
for a landing.

09:54.144 --> 09:56.212
Wow, you don't know how
impressive that is

09:56.246 --> 09:59.315
to a boy whose dad can't
even get the dog to sit.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.317
Sit. Sit.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.486
Sit...

10:03.520 --> 10:05.054
Sit!

10:05.088 --> 10:06.555
Sit!

10:06.590 --> 10:08.757
I don't know what that is,

10:08.792 --> 10:10.726
but it's not sitting!

10:10.760 --> 10:13.229
Where could Bart be?

10:13.263 --> 10:15.464
I saw him heading across
the field after school

10:15.499 --> 10:18.567
with a kid a little bit older
and undoubtedly wiser.

10:18.602 --> 10:21.837
Oh, I know
what that means!

10:21.872 --> 10:26.075
There comes a time when
a boy sneaks his first beer.

10:26.109 --> 10:29.111
Finally! I was beginning
to think that kid was a...

10:29.146 --> 10:30.880
teetotaler.

10:30.914 --> 10:33.082
Bart Simpson,
at your service.

10:33.116 --> 10:35.451
More like "at your six-pack,"
am I right?

10:36.753 --> 10:39.255
It's okay if you need
to take a little nap.

10:39.289 --> 10:40.689
Why would I want a nap?

10:40.724 --> 10:44.093
Because you're so drunk
you can barely keep it together.

10:44.127 --> 10:45.094
I wasn't drinking.

10:45.128 --> 10:46.362
I was learning
that nature

10:46.396 --> 10:48.063
isn't a complete
waste of space.

10:48.098 --> 10:49.632
That doesn't
sound like you.

10:49.666 --> 10:51.700
But it does sound
like the kind of lie

10:51.735 --> 10:54.837
you'd make up after
the first time you got blitzed.

10:54.871 --> 10:55.838
I met this kid.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.306
A little older, kind of strange.

10:57.340 --> 10:58.807
I don't think
other people get him.

10:58.842 --> 11:01.110
But I just want to hang out
with him all the time.

11:01.144 --> 11:03.379
It's even better
than I thought.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.482
You've found
your Moe Szyslak!

11:06.507 --> 11:08.708
In just a few short years,

11:08.733 --> 11:10.733
you'll be getting
your version of baked

11:11.088 --> 11:12.989
on your version of pot

11:13.023 --> 11:15.425
listening to your version
of Journey.

11:16.761 --> 11:17.727
Wha...?

11:17.762 --> 11:19.329
What's he doing?

11:23.534 --> 11:25.201
Now, when he lands,
you'll feed him

11:25.236 --> 11:28.204
so he has positive
associations with you.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.509
Don't worry, he's only bitten
off one of my fingers.

11:34.211 --> 11:35.211
Just goofing on you.

11:35.246 --> 11:37.080
This is the finger he bit off.

11:40.818 --> 11:43.520
If he starts to carry you off,
slip out of the glove.

11:43.554 --> 11:45.088
Now tell him to fly.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.623
Fly! Fly!

11:46.657 --> 11:49.459
Come on, man!
Do the wing thing!

11:50.494 --> 11:51.528
I did it! He did it!

11:51.562 --> 11:52.829
We did it!

11:52.863 --> 11:53.830
Yes, Bart, that is

11:53.864 --> 11:55.231
how you conjugate
the verb "to do."

11:55.266 --> 11:56.866
Well done.

Whoa! Did you teach
him to do that?

12:41.879 --> 12:44.681
Nobody could
communicate that.

12:44.715 --> 12:46.816
Except maybe
Gerard Manley Hopkins.

12:46.851 --> 12:48.985
"I caught this morning
morning's minion

12:49.019 --> 12:50.587
"Kingdom of daylight's dauphin,

12:50.621 --> 12:52.856
"Dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon,

12:52.890 --> 12:56.359
"Of the rolling level underneath
him steady air, and striding

12:56.393 --> 13:00.129
High there, how he rung upon
the rein of a wimpling wing."

13:00.164 --> 13:01.965
Wow!

13:03.300 --> 13:05.001
I've already eaten.

13:05.035 --> 13:07.937
Hey, you want to see
something really cool?

13:07.972 --> 13:10.473
Is a falcon's training leash
called a creance?

13:10.507 --> 13:11.507
Yes!

13:21.752 --> 13:24.554
Say something so I'll know
you're not hurt.

13:24.588 --> 13:26.456
I'm really hurt.
Phew!

13:31.767 --> 13:32.967
Bartholomew!

13:33.002 --> 13:34.235
Good to see you, old sport.

13:34.270 --> 13:35.603
Where's Freedom?

13:35.638 --> 13:38.306
Well, my dad said don't bring
home any more dogs, cats,

13:38.340 --> 13:40.408
turtles or snakes,
but he never

13:40.443 --> 13:43.478
said anything
about predatory birds.

13:46.182 --> 13:49.551
Okay, in your terms,
points are like mice...

13:50.786 --> 13:52.153
Don't interrupt.
I just thought

13:52.188 --> 13:54.055
it would be nice
if we shared an interest.

13:56.726 --> 13:58.226
Ooh...

13:58.260 --> 14:01.062
You Korean girls know
what a soldier likes.

14:02.998 --> 14:05.233
Fine! But the game
is much more enjoyable

14:05.267 --> 14:06.468
if you understand it.

14:06.502 --> 14:08.536
Look, the Eagles
and the Falcons.

14:08.571 --> 14:10.438
Tell me you're
not interested in that.

14:12.508 --> 14:14.309
I could fly, too,
if I didn't have

14:14.343 --> 14:15.810
a wife and three kids!

14:15.845 --> 14:18.413
Hey, you've had
a lot of visitors.

14:18.447 --> 14:20.415
No, I signed them myself.

14:20.449 --> 14:22.650
They're people I would've
liked to come visit.

14:22.685 --> 14:24.819
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

14:24.854 --> 14:27.989
Listen, what happened
in that tree?

14:28.023 --> 14:29.824
Um, you want the truth?

14:29.859 --> 14:31.059
Of course you do.

14:31.093 --> 14:32.460
You're like Diogenes.

14:32.495 --> 14:34.329
But with slingshot
in place of lamp.

14:37.233 --> 14:39.834
I wanted to fly.

14:39.869 --> 14:41.870
I know it sounds
a little crazy now,

14:41.904 --> 14:44.139
but I suddenly thought
maybe we can all fly,

14:44.173 --> 14:46.407
but somehow we've forgotten
that we can.

14:46.442 --> 14:48.743
You don't still
think that, do you?

14:48.778 --> 14:51.412
Hey, I'm not flying anywhere
with this broken wing.

14:52.948 --> 14:55.083
Bart, here's another doctor
that would like

14:55.117 --> 14:57.185
a few words
with this young man.

14:57.219 --> 15:00.522
This hospital has
another doctor?

15:04.627 --> 15:07.095
So they're transferring him
to another hospital.

15:07.129 --> 15:10.031
Well, I hope he gets out soon
and takes his bird back.

15:10.065 --> 15:13.034
I don't care
for how it circles the cat.

15:15.638 --> 15:17.939
He's just riding the thermals
from Dad's butt.

15:17.973 --> 15:20.875
At least someone in this family
is using them.

15:20.910 --> 15:22.377
I never heard
of this new hospital,

15:22.411 --> 15:24.379
so I looked it up
and printed it out.

15:24.413 --> 15:26.047
Ooh!

15:26.081 --> 15:27.549
Can I visit him tomorrow?

15:27.583 --> 15:29.784
I don't know, Bart.

15:29.819 --> 15:31.452
This is one of those

15:31.487 --> 15:34.255
Arkham Asylum-type hospitals.

15:34.290 --> 15:35.723
Diggs isn't cuckoo!

15:35.758 --> 15:37.225
Uh, listen, boy.

15:37.259 --> 15:38.860
Maybe you should
spend more time

15:38.894 --> 15:40.895
with your old
best friend.

15:40.930 --> 15:42.430
You know, Dweebler.

15:42.464 --> 15:45.133
Milhouse abandoned me.

15:45.167 --> 15:46.935
So, why can't I go there?

15:46.969 --> 15:49.304
Bart, if this is
what I think it is,

15:49.338 --> 15:52.874
it's not a place we should ever,
ever take a little boy.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.509
Then why is Diggs there?

15:54.543 --> 15:57.712
Because it's
his home forever.

16:00.416 --> 16:02.217
You know, Bart,

16:02.251 --> 16:04.118
just because Diggs
is a little different

16:04.153 --> 16:06.788
doesn't mean
he's not a good person.

16:06.822 --> 16:08.723
What would you know
about friends like Diggs?

16:08.757 --> 16:10.225
I have about eight of them.

16:10.259 --> 16:11.960
So, how do we fix him?

16:11.994 --> 16:13.528
Oh, Bart.

16:13.562 --> 16:16.264
Diggs's problems
don't have easy fixes.

16:16.298 --> 16:18.800
What kind of cheer-up
talk is this?

16:18.834 --> 16:22.170
Well, sometimes it helps
to know people feel for you.

16:22.204 --> 16:24.239
Want a hug?

16:27.509 --> 16:28.543
You hug the bedpost.

16:28.577 --> 16:29.811
Then I hug the bedpost.

16:29.845 --> 16:31.846
That way we never
hug each other.

Mired.

17:17.358 --> 17:18.660
I knew you'd escape!

17:18.694 --> 17:20.662
Were you carried out
by a flock of falcons?

17:20.695 --> 17:22.096
I got a one-day pass.

17:22.131 --> 17:23.564
Were falcons involved
in any way?

17:23.598 --> 17:27.001
I obtained the pass to enter the
Springfield Falconry Contest,

17:27.036 --> 17:28.803
which is what Freedom and I
were training for

17:28.837 --> 17:30.071
when we first met you.

17:30.105 --> 17:31.205
Oh, great.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.074
Before anything else,
let me just get closer

17:33.108 --> 17:35.910
to the door and say,
"How crazy are you?"

17:35.945 --> 17:38.346
I'm fine. My meds won't
wear off till tonight.

17:38.380 --> 17:41.749
Then I'll have Freedom
tear you to shreds.

17:41.784 --> 17:43.584
No offense, but when a crazy guy

17:43.619 --> 17:46.421
pretends to be crazy,
it's not funny.

17:46.455 --> 17:48.089
You're discounting
all talk radio.

17:57.900 --> 17:59.267
Excellent.

17:59.301 --> 18:02.003
Fly, my pet, fly!

18:02.037 --> 18:04.806
Yes!

18:04.840 --> 18:07.075
Yes, now back to Papa.

18:07.109 --> 18:08.443
Yes.

18:10.179 --> 18:12.347
Why am I not surprised
the only sport you do

18:12.381 --> 18:14.916
is one where
a bird brings you food?

18:14.950 --> 18:17.085
Um, a falcon's greatest joy

18:17.119 --> 18:18.453
is to serve its master.

18:18.487 --> 18:20.355
Fatso!

18:20.389 --> 18:21.856
Once again, I must point out

18:21.890 --> 18:23.224
that you are not a parrot.

18:23.258 --> 18:25.059
Fatso, fatso!
Pees in the shower!

18:25.094 --> 18:27.261
Shut up.

18:30.132 --> 18:31.299
What are you doing?

18:31.333 --> 18:32.300
We're up next.

18:32.334 --> 18:33.534
When Freedom
hits the air,

18:33.569 --> 18:35.269
you and I open
all the cages.

18:35.304 --> 18:36.537
Um...

18:36.572 --> 18:38.139
with our minds?

18:38.173 --> 18:39.207
No.

18:39.241 --> 18:40.375
With this rope.

18:40.409 --> 18:41.509
I'm a messed-up kid.

18:41.543 --> 18:43.044
I'm not Magneto.

18:43.078 --> 18:45.113
Diggs and Freedom.

18:57.326 --> 18:58.459
"In his ecstasy.

18:58.494 --> 19:01.062
Then off, off forth on swing!"

19:01.096 --> 19:02.930
Where's my bird going?

19:02.965 --> 19:04.065
Wherever he wants.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.233
He's free now.

19:05.267 --> 19:07.535
If you see the stork
what brings us babies,

19:07.569 --> 19:08.903
kill it!

19:10.639 --> 19:14.008
Now, Bart, I'm afraid one-day
passes don't last forever.

19:14.043 --> 19:16.177
And I'm probably not
going to get another one

19:16.211 --> 19:17.945
for quite a while.

19:17.980 --> 19:18.980
Wait!

19:19.014 --> 19:20.348
Wh-When will I see you?

19:20.382 --> 19:22.316
You can't quit
the falconry club!

19:22.351 --> 19:24.152
It's all yours, Mr. President.

19:24.186 --> 19:26.421
Well, I guess
some delicate birds

19:26.455 --> 19:28.756
are safer in a cage.

19:28.791 --> 19:30.892
I had thought of it as
a therapeutic milieu,

19:30.926 --> 19:34.328
but now "cage" is stuck
in my head, so thanks.

19:34.363 --> 19:36.931
And thanks for being my friend.

19:45.040 --> 19:47.608
Bart, when I
pushed you away,

19:47.643 --> 19:51.012
I was really pushing away
the thought of losing you.

19:51.046 --> 19:53.247
How long did it take you
to think that up?

19:53.282 --> 19:55.149
Two hours with the therapist.

19:55.184 --> 19:56.317
I'll take that.

19:56.351 --> 19:57.985
She came in
on a Saturday.

19:58.020 --> 20:00.421
Missed her kid's
karate demonstration.

20:00.456 --> 20:01.756
He was going up a belt.

20:01.790 --> 20:02.990
Enough!

20:10.715 --> 20:12.783
Mom, you didn't
cook the falcon?

20:12.817 --> 20:15.118
Of course not.
It's just duck.

20:15.153 --> 20:16.787
