Previously on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"...

00:04.003 --> 00:06.106
{\an8}Hello?

00:04.003 --> 00:06.106
{\an9}Come on up.

00:06.172 --> 00:08.274
{\an8}I'm stuck on the couch.
I can't move.

00:08.341 --> 00:11.111
{\an7}He decided to pretty much deny
that this is his child.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.712
{\an8}This is why I'm here.

00:12.779 --> 00:14.347
{\an8}A paternity test
has to be done.

00:14.414 --> 00:16.116
{\an7}Do you want to go
through the court process?

00:17.584 --> 00:19.185
{\an7}I'm actually talking
to somebody.

00:19.252 --> 00:20.353
{\an9}Fizz?

00:19.252 --> 00:20.353
{\an7}No.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.956
{\an8}Who?

00:20.420 --> 00:22.956
{\an7}I'm actually talking
to two people.

00:23.022 --> 00:23.990
{\an9}What?

00:24.057 --> 00:26.192
{\an7}They don't know
about each other.

00:26.259 --> 00:27.927
{\an8}You make it sound
like my mom is the devil

00:27.994 --> 00:29.529
{\an8}and your mom is an angel.

00:27.994 --> 00:29.529
{\an7}No.

00:29.596 --> 00:30.563
{\an8}Let's be real here.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.598
{\an8}Your mom is hard
to deal with,

00:32.665 --> 00:34.634
{\an8}especially living
under our roof.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.170
{\an7}Everybody can see you think
you Miss Diva anyway.

00:37.237 --> 00:38.505
{\an8}You and your mama.

00:38.571 --> 00:39.739
{\an8}You want to be stars.

00:38.571 --> 00:39.739
{\an8}Diva? I just live my life.

00:39.806 --> 00:41.574
{\an8}We want to be stars?

00:41.641 --> 00:43.877
{\an8}(mocking laugh)
Sound like a horse.

00:43.943 --> 00:46.179
{\an8}You can't change me.
Change your mama.

00:46.246 --> 00:47.881
{\an8}That's what you do.

00:46.246 --> 00:47.881
{\an7}We not even gonna
talk about my mama.

00:47.947 --> 00:49.849
{\an8}When is she leaving?

00:49.916 --> 00:52.018
{\an8}I just did an EP
for 27,000,

00:52.085 --> 00:53.553
{\an8}so all that money
is his.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.822
{\an8}So, all 27,000
is for Brandus?

00:55.889 --> 00:57.924
{\an8}It's your money, but she's
gonna hold it for you.

00:57.991 --> 01:01.461
{\an8}This is Brandus' money!
Money!

01:01.528 --> 01:03.196
{\an8}I have been on Max

01:03.263 --> 01:05.364
{\an8}that we need to put away
money for the baby.

01:05.432 --> 01:07.333
{\an7}You did not spend
that money.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.602
{\an8}I know that this is gonna
make good money back.

01:09.669 --> 01:10.904
{\an8}I'm scared for you.

01:12.272 --> 01:13.940
{\an8}You guys can go
shop anywhere,

01:14.007 --> 01:15.208
{\an8}but to be
in here strong,

01:15.275 --> 01:17.043
{\an8}Ray, Princess,
Mommy--

01:17.110 --> 01:18.778
{\an9}Baby, hey!

01:18.845 --> 01:21.314
{\an8}This is 50% our store.

01:21.381 --> 01:22.315
{\an7}Where you get
the money?

01:22.382 --> 01:25.351
{\an8}The 27,000
that you had--

01:25.418 --> 01:26.953
{\an7}I know you're not talking
about my son's money.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.221
{\an8}I'm gonna talk
to you later.

01:28.288 --> 01:29.522
{\an8}I'm gonna talk
to you later.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.391
{\an7}No!

01:29.589 --> 01:31.391
{\an8}Don't do that.

01:31.458 --> 01:32.926
{\an8}No! No! No!

01:31.458 --> 01:32.926
{\an9}Go.

01:32.992 --> 01:34.761
{\an9}No! No!

01:34.828 --> 01:36.062
{\an9}No!

01:36.129 --> 01:38.965
{\an7}Swear to God, I didn't
want this to end like this.

{\an8}It's real tough
when you love somebody

02:18.805 --> 02:20.039
{\an8}and then they lie to you.

02:20.106 --> 02:23.810
Lil' Brandi took $27,000
to use for her store.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.446
She lied about it,
tried to make more money.

02:26.513 --> 02:28.081
It's a tough thing.

02:28.147 --> 02:29.349
If you love somebody,

02:29.415 --> 02:30.650
you got to go through
the ups and downs.

02:30.717 --> 02:34.153
She didn't cheat on you,
so you good.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.722
Got the blankets
and the pillows

02:35.788 --> 02:37.924
{\an1}and (bleep) up in here.
Man.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.158
You ain't went home?

02:39.225 --> 02:41.394
I'm trying to just
focus on some music

02:41.461 --> 02:44.097
so I don't think
about the drama.

02:44.163 --> 02:45.999
{\an1}How you feeling
about that (bleep)?

02:46.065 --> 02:47.133
Feel, like, betrayed.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.069
Like, she stole
the money from our baby.

02:50.136 --> 02:52.605
{\an1}That (bleep) ain't right,
you know?

02:52.672 --> 02:54.507
To me, it ain't even
about the money, though.

02:54.574 --> 02:56.476
It's just the fact
that at this point,

02:56.543 --> 02:57.877
after everything
we've been through,

02:57.944 --> 03:01.114
we back, like, to lying
and making moves,

03:01.180 --> 03:02.315
and it ain't
necessary, you know?

03:02.382 --> 03:03.917
We should be past
all that by now,

03:03.983 --> 03:06.286
and it ain't like
I ever tell her no,

03:06.352 --> 03:07.654
so it ain't like
she had to worry

03:07.720 --> 03:09.389
about if I was gonna
say yeah or no.

03:09.455 --> 03:10.890
I know it's tough.

03:10.957 --> 03:12.759
She ain't never did
nothing like this.

03:12.825 --> 03:13.993
Because if you
(bleep) with me,

03:14.060 --> 03:16.462
then you wouldn't do
anything like that.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.964
{\an8}B's always been
my ride or die,

03:18.031 --> 03:21.534
{\an8}but now that I know she been
lying over and over again,

03:21.601 --> 03:23.336
{\an8}I don't want to go home
and hear all her excuses

03:23.403 --> 03:24.938
{\an8}and lies to why she did it.

03:25.004 --> 03:27.307
I forgive, but I don't forget.

03:27.373 --> 03:28.541
What you gon' do?

03:28.608 --> 03:29.676
I definitely don't
want to come around

03:29.742 --> 03:32.145
'til she put
that money back.

03:32.211 --> 03:34.047
{\an3}For sure.

03:34.113 --> 03:35.915
No, it just
don't feel right.

03:35.982 --> 03:38.017
{\an1}I just want to know
when I talk to her about it,

03:38.084 --> 03:39.485
she don't try
to defend herself.

03:39.552 --> 03:42.221
But now it's like
you at the studio.

03:42.288 --> 03:45.058
{\an1}You don't need to be
sleeping here every night.

03:45.124 --> 03:46.225
Know what I'm saying?

03:46.292 --> 03:48.795
{\an1}You don't need to start
hitting the clubs

03:48.861 --> 03:50.129
and (bleep) all that.

03:50.196 --> 03:51.230
{\an1}You know what
I'm saying?

03:51.297 --> 03:52.899
{\an1}You got to go get
your family.

03:52.966 --> 03:55.335
Watching this marriage stuff
is crazy.

03:55.401 --> 03:56.903
I mean, can you really
trust someone?

03:56.970 --> 03:58.938
I mean, I think
I could trust Princess,

03:59.005 --> 04:00.940
but after seeing what
Max Lux is going through

04:01.007 --> 04:02.175
with Lil' Brandi,

04:02.241 --> 04:03.977
I mean, you know,

04:04.043 --> 04:06.012
got me thinking.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.680
{\an1}If this is what I got
to look forward to,

04:07.747 --> 04:10.350
I don't know about this
marriage (bleep), man.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.919
{\an1}Supposed to be

{\an8}I asked my mom
to come to my rehearsal

04:42.849 --> 04:45.151
{\an8}so she could hear me
sing my new song "Hello."

04:45.218 --> 04:47.487
She always has a lot of input
on my vocals.

04:47.553 --> 04:51.691
She also always has a lot to say
about my fiancé and his mom,

04:51.758 --> 04:53.860
and I've got to talk to her
about that too.

04:53.926 --> 04:55.662
{\an1}When you're doing it live,
I need you to, like, really--

04:55.728 --> 04:57.764

05:16.015 --> 05:18.418
It seems like every day
there's some sort of drama.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.787
If not one,
it's both of our moms.

05:20.853 --> 05:22.722
A1 and I
are getting married soon,

05:22.789 --> 05:25.058
and I really want
all of us

05:25.124 --> 05:27.460
to just be one big,
happy family.

05:27.527 --> 05:29.429
You guys, if you're
gonna be married--

05:29.495 --> 05:30.730
And it looks like
that's gonna happen.

05:30.797 --> 05:32.065
{\an3}I love A1.

05:32.131 --> 05:33.566
It seems that
since his mom came,

05:33.633 --> 05:36.536
have you noticed that even
our dynamic is different?

05:36.602 --> 05:38.905
{\an1}And I do agree that Pam
has done a lot of things,

05:38.971 --> 05:40.740
{\an1}but we're trying to find
a happy medium

05:40.807 --> 05:43.342
{\an1}so that we can coexist
and hang out.

05:43.409 --> 05:44.510
{\an1}You can come over
and we're--

05:44.577 --> 05:46.212
{\an1}I don't want you to ever
call me anymore

05:46.279 --> 05:47.680
{\an1}and say, "Ooh, Pam's there?
I ain't coming."

05:47.747 --> 05:49.916
Pam moved
into your home,

05:49.982 --> 05:51.884
y'all's home together,

05:51.951 --> 05:53.853
and started to throw
her weight around,

05:53.920 --> 05:55.121
with no respect
for you,

05:55.188 --> 05:56.989
to the point that
you were stressed out.

05:57.056 --> 05:58.057
You were calling me

05:58.124 --> 05:59.592
and "Mommy,
don't say anything."

05:59.659 --> 06:02.228
But you've said literally
every time Pam was there

06:02.295 --> 06:04.063
{\an1}you're not coming over
for a while now.

06:04.130 --> 06:06.265
Well, for a while because
she's been living there.

06:06.332 --> 06:09.502
Listen...
Pam drives me crazy too,

06:09.569 --> 06:11.404
but she's gonna be
my mother-in-law,

06:11.471 --> 06:12.905
so now that she's moving
out of the house,

06:12.972 --> 06:14.607
I don't see why
we can't get along.

06:14.674 --> 06:15.975
What my mom
needs to realize

06:16.042 --> 06:18.511
is she's gonna miss out
on a lot of family moments

06:18.578 --> 06:20.980
if she can't be a big girl
and just act right.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.281
I want there to be peace,

06:22.348 --> 06:24.417
{\an1}and I want you guys
to be able to get along

06:24.484 --> 06:25.585
{\an1}and for the vibe
and everything

06:25.651 --> 06:28.955
{\an1}to be good and positive
from here on out.

06:29.021 --> 06:30.389
{\an1}No drama.

06:30.456 --> 06:33.593
{\an1}And I feel like you
should reach out to Pam.

06:33.659 --> 06:34.961
{\an3}Ooh.

06:35.027 --> 06:40.032
My daughter wants us to be
this big, happy family,

06:40.099 --> 06:43.069
but you cannot be a family
with somebody

06:43.136 --> 06:45.972
who is blackhearted
and evil against you,

06:46.038 --> 06:48.541
and I think that she is
that way towards me.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.143
No matter what
I've tried to do--

06:50.209 --> 06:51.911
taken her out to eat,

06:51.978 --> 06:53.646
tried to help her
fix her look up--

06:53.713 --> 06:56.182
she took it as I was,
like, putting her down,

06:56.249 --> 06:58.017
but I was trying
to help her.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.286
{\an1}I'm asking you
to do that for me.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.421
Why I need to do that
and she's the one who--

07:02.488 --> 07:04.757
{\an1}It's not a "She's the one,"
it's "We's the one."

07:04.824 --> 07:06.492
The mother-in-laws.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.831
♪♪

07:16.169 --> 07:19.405
I need a good coming-home-

07:19.472 --> 07:20.640
Outfit?
Oh, I did that too.

07:20.706 --> 07:22.642
{\an5}And this would be
too basic?

07:20.706 --> 07:22.642
{\an1}Yeah.

07:22.708 --> 07:23.776
{\an6}Okay.

07:22.708 --> 07:23.776
We don't do basic.

{\an8}Masika's been my girl
for years,

07:25.411 --> 07:27.747
{\an8}so I couldn't be more excited
to see her having this baby.

07:27.814 --> 07:28.948
Fetty has been dragging her

07:29.015 --> 07:31.083

and the blogs,

07:31.150 --> 07:32.852
and it's killing me
to watch her go through this

07:32.919 --> 07:34.453
when this should be
a happy time for her.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.255
{\an1}I'm watching all these tweets
going back and forth

07:36.322 --> 07:37.757
between you and Fetty.

07:37.824 --> 07:39.225
I feel like
in the industry,

07:39.292 --> 07:41.127
like, women are so easy
to discredit

07:41.194 --> 07:42.995
{\an5}by these rappers
or by men...

07:41.194 --> 07:42.995
{\an1}Exactly.

07:43.062 --> 07:45.231
...who, like, they could throw
the ho card on you in a minute.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.432
{\an7}You know,
it was difficult,

07:46.499 --> 07:48.000
{\an8}'cause everyone knows
I'm a clap-back queen.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.870
{\an5}Yes, we know.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.870
{\an1}And there's so much
I really wanted to say,

07:50.937 --> 07:53.172
{\an1}but then when he came out
with the denial,

07:53.239 --> 07:55.308
{\an4}I was like, "Oh, hell, no"
because...

07:53.239 --> 07:55.308
That pissed you off.

07:55.374 --> 07:57.109
{\an1}...you're denying
our child.

07:57.176 --> 07:58.344
{\an8}And he's starting to
look like a deadbeat

07:58.411 --> 07:59.946
{\an8}before the baby's
even here.

08:00.012 --> 08:01.414
How crazy is that?

08:01.480 --> 08:04.016
{\an1}So, I actually went
and talked to a lawyer.

08:04.083 --> 08:05.384
{\an1}And you can't report
what I'm about to tell you,

08:05.451 --> 08:06.452
by the way.

08:05.451 --> 08:06.452
{\an3}I'm not.

08:06.519 --> 08:08.554
{\an5}What? What's going on?

08:06.519 --> 08:08.554
{\an1}Okay, so,

08:08.621 --> 08:13.626
{\an1}I filed to get him served
with a paternity suit.

08:13.693 --> 08:14.794
And it was very difficult

08:14.861 --> 08:16.562
'cause I never wanted
to be in a situation

08:16.629 --> 08:18.865
{\an1}where I had to deal
with my child's father

08:18.931 --> 08:20.733
with a legal counsel.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.669
{\an1}So, I'm thinking
I'm gonna have the baby,

08:23.736 --> 08:25.705
we'll figure it out when
it's time to go to court.

08:25.771 --> 08:28.040
So, her father has asked

08:28.107 --> 08:29.909
if he could come
to the hospital,

08:29.976 --> 08:32.278
and he apologized.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.645
What motivated him
to do that, though?

08:33.712 --> 08:35.881
{\an5}I have no idea.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.881
Just out the blue?

08:35.948 --> 08:37.683
{\an1}It literally came out
of the clear, blue sky.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.318
{\an1}Like, do you think
he's up to something,

08:39.385 --> 08:42.755
{\an1}or he really just
genuinely wants to be...

08:42.822 --> 08:44.624
I think he might have
talked to an adult

08:44.690 --> 08:45.992
or even a publicist,
like, "(bleep),

08:46.058 --> 08:47.293
"like, you got to get
your (bleep) together

08:47.360 --> 08:49.161
{\an1}'cause this is looking
real bad for you right now."

08:49.228 --> 08:50.897
He was getting a lot
of hits online, though,

08:50.963 --> 08:53.633
'cause people were really
not for the bull(bleep).

08:53.699 --> 08:57.570
When he went public
with the disrespect

08:57.637 --> 09:00.439
and calling me out on my name
and denying our child,

09:00.506 --> 09:02.808
it was so hurtful
not just to me as a woman

09:02.875 --> 09:04.210
but to me as a mother.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.345
So, when this apology came,

09:06.412 --> 09:08.447
I was very appreciative
of it,

09:08.514 --> 09:11.450
but I don't know if I can
take that to the bank just yet.

09:11.517 --> 09:13.219
{\an1}I'm gonna sit down
and talk to him.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.087
What do you want to get
out of it for you?

09:15.154 --> 09:16.555
{\an5}Well, I know what I want.

09:15.154 --> 09:16.555
{\an3}Okay.

09:16.622 --> 09:17.790
{\an5}I want a full-time father.

09:16.622 --> 09:17.790
{\an3}Okay.

09:17.857 --> 09:20.526
{\an1}And with the way he's been
talking and acting,

09:20.593 --> 09:22.194
I feel like it's possible,

09:22.261 --> 09:23.562
{\an1}but then again,
how he treated me,

09:23.629 --> 09:24.897
{\an1}I never thought
that would be possible.

09:24.964 --> 09:27.066
Hopefully his intentions
are pure

09:27.133 --> 09:28.334
and he's doing it
for all the right reasons,

09:28.401 --> 09:29.635
but I don't know.

09:29.702 --> 09:31.237
I mean, I'm gonna hear
what he has to say,

09:31.304 --> 09:33.739
but I'm not just gonna
jump back in

09:33.806 --> 09:35.741
and act like everything
is back to normal.

09:35.808 --> 09:40.446
I mean, I do have to realize
he has a track record now.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.181
{\an5}We're not there yet.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.181
Oh, you're not here?

09:42.248 --> 09:44.550
{\an1}Maybe we can buy that
in a size, like, 12 months.

09:44.617 --> 09:47.019
{\an3}Okay.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.287
{\an8}Coming up...

09:48.354 --> 09:51.724
{\an7}When you first called,
I was a little skeptical.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.826
{\an7}I wasn't really sure
what to think.

09:53.893 --> 09:56.262
{\an7}Do want to know,
like, what changed?

09:56.329 --> 09:57.830
{\an8}Like, we was
Bonnie and Clyde,

09:57.897 --> 09:59.231
{\an8}and now it's like...
You know what I'm saying?

09:59.298 --> 10:01.600
{\an7}You come home
for me and the baby.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.002
{\an8}You don't seem
to know...

10:03.069 --> 10:04.904
{\an7}Whatever.

10:03.069 --> 10:04.904
{\an8}...when to leave.

10:04.971 --> 10:06.439
{\an8}Don't do that.

10:06.505 --> 10:08.074
{\an7}(bleep) I'm not
gonna put up

10:08.140 --> 10:10.242

10:29.895 --> 10:31.864
Y'all may know me
from my past relationship

10:31.931 --> 10:33.866
with my ex, Nicki Minaj.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.768
We were together
for 12 years.

10:35.835 --> 10:37.937
Two years ago,
we had a bad breakup,

10:38.004 --> 10:39.405
but I'm past all that.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.441
I'm just trying to rebuild
myself and focus on me

10:53.386 --> 10:55.454
I left Brooklyn, New York,
because, you know,

10:55.521 --> 10:58.524
I just wanted to get away
from all of the drama.

10:58.591 --> 11:01.327

my fan base is growing,

11:01.394 --> 11:04.663

are beautiful.

I was totally focused
on everything her.

11:17.143 --> 11:18.544
I was her executive producer,

11:18.611 --> 11:20.980
A&amp;R coordinator,
composer.

11:21.047 --> 11:23.049
Now that that situation
is done and over with,

11:38.964 --> 11:41.067
{\an5}You're developing Safaree.

11:38.964 --> 11:41.067
Yeah, I'm doing developing.

11:41.133 --> 11:44.036
{\an1}Like, I'm recording, like,
my own music now.

11:44.103 --> 11:46.705
Like, I'm doing, like,
it's reggae dancehall

11:46.772 --> 11:48.274
mixed with, like, rap.

11:48.340 --> 11:51.644

12:03.923 --> 12:06.692

12:06.759 --> 12:08.661
{\an4}Yeah.

12:06.759 --> 12:08.661

social media...

12:08.727 --> 12:10.796
{\an4}Okay.

12:08.727 --> 12:10.796
...I'm seeing a lot
of tweets

12:10.863 --> 12:12.698
from, you know,
your ex,

12:12.765 --> 12:15.601

kind of a big deal.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.873
As much as I want
to get away

12:20.940 --> 12:22.575
from my past relationship
with Nicki,

12:22.641 --> 12:25.111
every interview I do,
they bring her name up.

12:25.177 --> 12:27.446
When you're with somebody
for so long,

12:27.513 --> 12:29.315
you kind of don't expect things
to turn sour,

12:29.381 --> 12:31.617
so you don't really
put things on paper.

12:31.684 --> 12:35.087
I had my lawyers reach out
just to handle my business.

12:35.154 --> 12:36.455
I put in work.

12:36.522 --> 12:38.491
I just want to get
what I want to get from my work.

12:38.557 --> 12:39.992
There's Twitter beef
and nonsense,

the real situation is.

12:46.632 --> 12:49.535
But I'm just glad
that I got over that hump

12:49.602 --> 12:51.237
so that I could just
focus on me

12:51.303 --> 12:53.706
and just not even
dwell on the negative,

14:36.976 --> 14:39.011
I want to be the one,
when she gets older,

14:39.078 --> 14:41.513
"That's my daddy."
"Yes, hi."

14:42.915 --> 14:44.016
{\an1}Well, yeah,
I appreciate that,

14:44.083 --> 14:46.952
{\an1}but I do want to know,
like, what changed?

14:47.019 --> 14:48.354
Like, what made you...

14:48.420 --> 14:51.257
It was just, like,
I just had to man up.

14:51.323 --> 14:52.992
That's basically
what it is.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.194
Either you was gonna
accept it or you wasn't.

14:55.261 --> 14:57.196
Like, I tell you,
like, just--

14:57.263 --> 14:59.298
I mean, thank you
for accepting it.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.233
After all of the hurt
and embarrassment

15:01.300 --> 15:02.901
that Willie has put me
through,

15:02.968 --> 15:05.671
I really haven't been quick
to admit to myself

15:05.738 --> 15:07.206
that I'm gonna be
dealing with this man

15:07.273 --> 15:08.974
for the rest
of my natural life.

15:09.041 --> 15:12.111
I don't think that he can
ever fully understand

15:12.177 --> 15:15.881
how stressful
he's made the situation

15:15.948 --> 15:18.183
and how dark it's gotten
for me,

15:18.250 --> 15:21.387
but the fact that he's
even acknowledging it

15:21.453 --> 15:24.523
is very helpful,
so we'll see.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.091
{\an1}I didn't think we would
get to this point,

15:26.158 --> 15:27.226
to be honest with you.

15:27.293 --> 15:28.961
I just think we
should have just

15:29.028 --> 15:31.263
at least just talked
or something.

15:31.330 --> 15:32.998
But how? Like, we
couldn't even have

15:33.065 --> 15:36.669
a conversation without
a hundred curse words.

15:36.735 --> 15:39.838
{\an1}It was very--
It was very difficult.

15:39.905 --> 15:41.106
{\an1}I definitely
want you to know

15:41.173 --> 15:42.541
that I'm gonna
work with you

15:42.608 --> 15:43.909
{\an1}to make sure,
like, you know,

15:43.976 --> 15:45.711
{\an1}you can see her
as much as you can,

15:45.778 --> 15:47.880
{\an1}and I'm not gonna
make it difficult for you

15:47.946 --> 15:49.648
{\an1}even though you made it
difficult for me.

15:49.715 --> 15:51.183
{\an1}Um...

15:51.250 --> 15:53.152
{\an1}I just appreciate
the place that we--

15:53.218 --> 15:54.653
{\an1}where we are
right now,

15:54.720 --> 15:57.022
{\an1}and I just want
to grow from there

15:57.089 --> 15:58.424
and build from there

15:58.490 --> 16:02.027
{\an1}and be, like, the coolest
freakin' parents, like, ever.

16:02.094 --> 16:04.697
Well, thank you
for letting me show you

16:04.763 --> 16:07.099
that I really want
to be her dad.

16:07.166 --> 16:10.235
This is the guy that I knew
and was dating,

16:10.302 --> 16:11.503
and it's perfect,

16:11.570 --> 16:13.806
but why couldn't he
have acted like this

16:13.872 --> 16:16.342
for those 1,738 months
I've been pregnant?

It's, like, refreshing,
but I don't know, bro.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.884

the poop diapers.

that was gonna
pay off later.

{\an1}A good lie. So, now
there's lies that are good?

that at the end of the day,

18:17.696 --> 18:18.964
it'll never really
be the same.

18:19.031 --> 18:20.332

Daddy Max!

then just be up front

and be like
"I did some bull(bleep).

19:04.543 --> 19:07.045

Do you forgive me?"

22:19.471 --> 22:21.540
It's not some crazy-expensive
Rolex.

22:21.606 --> 22:23.775
I could buy all the expensive
jewelry myself.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.211
But it's a sweet, friendly
reminder of who Safaree is

22:26.278 --> 22:28.780
and that he genuinely
does care about me.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.716
So, what does this
mean, exactly?

22:30.782 --> 22:34.052
{\an1}One love is just, like,
that's how I feel.

22:34.119 --> 22:36.421
{\an1}I don't know how
you feel yet, but...

22:36.488 --> 22:39.391
I'm just taking
my time.

22:39.458 --> 22:40.926
{\an1}Just behave yourself,
all right?

22:40.992 --> 22:43.161
Okay, promise.
How about that?

22:45.731 --> 22:47.632
♪♪

22:51.737 --> 22:54.139
You know, when my daughter
asked me to sit down

22:54.206 --> 22:55.841
and have a talk with Pam

22:55.907 --> 22:58.477
and just try to work out
what our issues were,

22:58.543 --> 23:00.378
I was very excited
to do that

23:00.445 --> 23:02.781
{\an8}because I don't ever
want to miss out

23:02.848 --> 23:05.917
{\an8}on an important event
in my daughter's life.

23:05.984 --> 23:10.589
I'm just hoping that she
can keep her filthy mouth clean

23:10.655 --> 23:12.124
and be a little open-minded

23:12.190 --> 23:15.260
and receptive to what
my intentions are.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.563
{\an1}Hey.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.563
{\an3}Hey.

23:18.630 --> 23:20.365
{\an5}How are you?

23:18.630 --> 23:20.365
A little like me.

23:20.432 --> 23:21.566
{\an1}I know.

23:21.633 --> 23:23.335
{\an4}Hopefully that's
a good thing.

23:21.633 --> 23:23.335
{\an3}Right.

23:23.401 --> 23:26.471
{\an4}I'm happy
that you came out.

23:23.401 --> 23:26.471
{\an3}Oh, yeah.

23:26.538 --> 23:28.106
I just wanted us
to get together

23:28.173 --> 23:29.641
as the mother...

23:28.173 --> 23:29.641
{\an3}Right.

23:29.708 --> 23:32.310
{\an8}...of A1 and Lyrica

23:32.377 --> 23:35.914
{\an7}so we could try to see
if we can have

23:35.981 --> 23:40.018
{\an1}at least a respectful
relationship moving forward

23:40.085 --> 23:41.219
for Lyrica and A1.

23:41.286 --> 23:42.888
I really don't have
no beef with you

23:42.954 --> 23:45.257
because of my son
and your daughter.

23:45.323 --> 23:47.859
I respect her as well
as I respect my son

23:47.926 --> 23:49.961
because I know
that they together,

23:50.028 --> 23:51.263
and we the grown folks.

23:51.329 --> 23:53.131
{\an4}Right.

23:51.329 --> 23:53.131
We're the adults,
come on.

23:53.198 --> 23:56.701
{\an1}So, have you started
looking for a place yet?

23:56.768 --> 23:58.470
She has nothing to do

23:58.537 --> 24:01.640
with how long I'm staying
with my son in the first place.

24:01.706 --> 24:03.542
That's none of her
damn business.

24:03.608 --> 24:06.211
Well, the understanding
between me and my son

24:06.278 --> 24:07.379
when I came here,

24:07.445 --> 24:09.414
it wasn't gonna be
one or two days.

24:09.481 --> 24:12.384
{\an1}Who can find a place
in one or two days in L.A.?

24:12.450 --> 24:15.620
{\an1}There's such thing
as overstaying your welcome,

24:15.687 --> 24:18.056
{\an1}or at least,
if you're there,

24:18.123 --> 24:20.592
{\an1}behave in a way
that people can at least

24:20.659 --> 24:22.294
{\an5}tolerate you
being there.

24:20.659 --> 24:22.294
{\an3}Right.

24:22.360 --> 24:23.428
I don't stay free.

24:23.495 --> 24:24.863
I cleans up every day.

24:24.930 --> 24:26.498
{\an5}And you should.

24:24.930 --> 24:26.498
I was cleaning.

24:26.565 --> 24:29.267
{\an1}After four months, Pam,
can you at least understand

24:29.334 --> 24:32.504
{\an1}how that would have
affected my daughter?

24:32.571 --> 24:34.906
{\an1}Me? A1?

24:34.973 --> 24:37.275
{\an1}I thought you,
as a woman of your age

24:37.342 --> 24:38.710
and of intelligence,

24:38.777 --> 24:41.213
{\an1}that you would know
it's time to go.

24:41.279 --> 24:44.783
I guess didn't nobody tell
this backup singer how I live,

24:44.850 --> 24:46.685
because I done already moved.

24:46.751 --> 24:48.553
What I don't like
about Lyrica,

24:48.620 --> 24:51.623
she's in everybody's business
like her (bleep) don't stink.

24:51.690 --> 24:54.693
{\an5}Arguing back and forth is gonna
lead to blows eventually, so...

24:51.690 --> 24:54.693
Right, right.

24:54.759 --> 24:56.761
{\an1}I don't hit you.
You know, I'ma tell you why.

24:56.828 --> 24:58.129
Because of
your daughter.

24:58.196 --> 24:59.865
They'll tell you
back home,

24:59.931 --> 25:01.333
I get along
with everybody.

25:01.399 --> 25:03.969
You, I'm like,
"Dang, what is it?"

25:04.035 --> 25:05.503
{\an1}You easily
offended, Pam?

25:05.570 --> 25:06.605
Yes, I really am.

25:06.671 --> 25:07.839
So, do you think
that's something

25:07.906 --> 25:09.407
{\an1}that you could
work on?

25:09.474 --> 25:11.376
You know what we're
gonna have to do?

25:11.443 --> 25:13.078
You're gonna have to
realize that I'm here.

25:14.946 --> 25:15.981
{\an8}Coming up...

25:16.047 --> 25:18.483

25:56.154 --> 25:58.490
I've been known to Ray
and Safaree for a minute now.

25:58.556 --> 26:01.359
I met 'em a couple of years ago
out on the Hollywood scene.

26:01.426 --> 26:03.361
I got 'em to come
to the studio,

26:03.428 --> 26:05.330
{\an8}started working

{\an1}He's all over Chris Brown's
(bleep) too.

26:11.169 --> 26:13.571
Bro, I was looking
on his Instagram, right,

26:13.638 --> 26:14.706
and I'm like, "Yo,

26:14.773 --> 26:15.941
"those sick joints
we played,

26:16.007 --> 26:17.909
{\an5}those are your joints?"

We been going in.

26:17.976 --> 26:19.544
I ain't even know.
You ain't even tell me.

26:19.611 --> 26:21.346
You've been low-key.
You've been like "Shh."

26:21.413 --> 26:22.480
{\an1}(laughing)

26:22.547 --> 26:24.316
{\an1}What's up with
you, though, man?

26:24.382 --> 26:26.017
Where I am now

26:26.084 --> 26:27.552
as opposed to,
like, a year ago,

26:27.619 --> 26:31.056
like, just mentally,
physically,

26:31.122 --> 26:32.457
just people that
were around me

26:32.524 --> 26:33.758
and just, like--

26:33.825 --> 26:36.528
I'm just in, like,
a real good head space.

26:36.594 --> 26:38.263
{\an1}That's where you're
supposed to be.

26:38.330 --> 26:39.898
{\an8}Right now,
Miss Nikki Baby and I,

26:39.965 --> 26:41.599
{\an8}we're keeping things
on the low.

26:41.666 --> 26:43.535
{\an8}I kind of want to say something
to the guys about her,

26:43.601 --> 26:47.605
{\an8}but I think I'ma just keep
that fine, round, juicy ass

26:47.672 --> 26:49.040
on the low.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.408
Straight.

26:50.475 --> 26:52.243
{\an5}What's poppin'
with you, my G?

26:50.475 --> 26:52.243
{\an1}Man...

26:52.310 --> 26:53.812
{\an1}I just be dealing
with a lot, though,

26:53.878 --> 26:55.413
with Lyrica's mom.

26:55.480 --> 26:56.481
Why? What's she
been doing?

26:56.548 --> 26:57.882
She be always
in the relationship?

26:57.949 --> 26:58.984
She's always, bro.

26:59.050 --> 27:00.385
I'll be like, "Yo, Lyrica,

27:00.452 --> 27:02.387
{\an1}"you have to stop telling
your mama everything.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.889
{\an4}You know what I'm saying?
Like, she don't need
to know your every move."

27:04.956 --> 27:06.257
So, is she part
of y'all management?

27:06.324 --> 27:07.792
She used to be
in Lyrica mix,

27:07.859 --> 27:09.494
{\an1}and to be honest,
I feel like

27:09.561 --> 27:11.963
{\an1}that was slowing
Lyrica up.

27:12.030 --> 27:13.665
Mom's at the club...

27:13.732 --> 27:16.568
Mom's at the club?
Mom ain't at the club.

27:16.634 --> 27:18.803
{\an1}Like, we riding to the club,
and she's demanding,

27:18.870 --> 27:20.705
{\an1}"Pull in the front.
Drop us off."

27:20.772 --> 27:22.807
{\an5}I'm like, "Oh..."

27:20.772 --> 27:22.807
Oh, you the Uber driver.

27:22.874 --> 27:25.543
I'm the Uber driver, bro.

27:25.610 --> 27:28.113
Mamas can't be
in the club, man. Like...

27:28.179 --> 27:29.214
Like, you know what?

27:29.280 --> 27:31.716
{\an1}My mom and her mom,
they clash.

27:31.783 --> 27:33.551
They don't like
each other, bro.

27:33.618 --> 27:34.719
{\an1}When they see each other,
it be, like,

27:34.786 --> 27:36.621
{\an1}Thanksgiving or something,
it's just like--

27:36.688 --> 27:38.990
{\an6}Still beef?

27:36.688 --> 27:38.990
{\an1}Ah, there's a beef
every time, bro.

27:39.057 --> 27:41.993
{\an5}Ah, mama beef.

27:39.057 --> 27:41.993
It's mama beef like a...

27:42.060 --> 27:43.928
Mama beef. Damn.

27:43.995 --> 27:46.097
{\an1}Bro, there's so much
mama beef, it's crazy.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.802
{\an8}Mama, daddies,
sisters, brothers,

27:50.869 --> 27:53.304
{\an8}all of that
becomes secondary

27:53.371 --> 27:55.840
{\an8}when you get married
and you fall in love.

27:55.907 --> 27:59.310
If you got a meddling mama,
that can mess some (bleep) up.

27:59.377 --> 28:00.612
{\an1}I think I'ma
just tell Lyrica,

28:00.678 --> 28:03.148
{\an1}look, tell your moms
we're about to do a dinner.

28:03.214 --> 28:05.583
{\an1}I'ma do the same
for my mom.

28:05.650 --> 28:08.620
Then, I upgraded the ring.

28:08.686 --> 28:09.888
I got to show you.

28:09.954 --> 28:11.756
Oh, you got it?

28:11.823 --> 28:14.092
{\an3}Ooh!

28:14.159 --> 28:16.227
(indistinct)

28:16.294 --> 28:17.462
Ooh, it got
the light up top.

28:17.529 --> 28:18.630
Oh, now, this is nice.

28:18.696 --> 28:19.998
{\an1}(laughing)
Yeah.

28:20.065 --> 28:21.699
I know why you trying
to show Ma.

28:21.766 --> 28:24.135
{\an5}You trying to be like,
"Look, stand down."

28:21.766 --> 28:24.135
{\an1}Yeah.

28:24.202 --> 28:26.671
I'm hoping by giving
Lyrica this ring

28:26.738 --> 28:28.173
in front of them,

28:28.239 --> 28:30.308
that it inspires them
to act right.

to meet my baby girl.

30:34.265 --> 30:37.735
I called Willie,
and he's rushing to the airport.

30:37.802 --> 30:40.972
I really hope he makes it
in time for this early birth,

30:41.039 --> 30:45.610
because baby girl is not
waiting on anybody today.

30:45.677 --> 30:48.413
{\an8}The contractions are getting
closer and closer,

30:48.479 --> 30:50.248
{\an8}and we're running out of time.

30:50.315 --> 30:53.084
{\an8}Just as I start to worry,
I get a text from Fetty,

30:53.151 --> 30:55.820
and he's landed,
and he's on the way.

33:10.054 --> 33:13.324
and my lingerie line
is nothing but sexy.

33:13.391 --> 33:15.426
So, I had to get
a true sex symbol

33:15.493 --> 33:16.694
{\an8}to show it off.

and I can't think of
a better way to sell sexy

my other boo?

34:05.943 --> 34:08.146
What started off
as a friendship

34:08.212 --> 34:10.148
has turned into something
a little bit more.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.351
{\an3}(laughing)

34:13.418 --> 34:15.119
I've never been serious
with a woman before,

34:15.186 --> 34:17.655
but I can't lie, I'm having
a lot of fun doing it.

34:17.722 --> 34:20.024
Rosa and I
have a lot in common.

34:21.525 --> 34:23.428
I'm open to seeing
where our relationship goes.

34:23.494 --> 34:25.329
Okay, so, like,

34:25.396 --> 34:27.130
I wanted to
tell you something.

34:27.197 --> 34:30.067
What was that?

34:30.134 --> 34:31.335
You know I'm always
honest with you,

34:31.402 --> 34:32.737
and you know I'm
so close to you,

34:32.804 --> 34:35.239
and I love
and adore you.

34:35.306 --> 34:37.175
You're special,
so just know that.

34:37.241 --> 34:39.210
{\an1}Well, you're special
to me too.

34:39.277 --> 34:40.545
That's what I'm saying.

34:40.610 --> 34:41.679
For the most part,

34:41.746 --> 34:44.248
these days I am
more attracted to girls,

34:44.315 --> 34:45.783
but Nikki's really special.

34:45.850 --> 34:48.886
We have a very special bond
because we're friends first.

34:48.953 --> 34:52.489
She's really sexy,
she's really, really attractive,

34:52.556 --> 34:55.193
and I just feel like
we were a perfect match.

34:55.259 --> 34:57.528
{\an1}So, you're not seeing
anybody else?

34:57.595 --> 34:58.696
{\an3}No.

34:58.763 --> 34:59.964
{\an3}I mean...

35:01.299 --> 35:02.366
You know, like,
right now I'm just,

35:02.433 --> 35:03.568
like, having fun
figuring it out,

35:03.634 --> 35:05.703
but if I had
a man on the side,

35:05.770 --> 35:07.538
would you be bothered?

35:07.605 --> 35:08.840
{\an1}Yeah.

35:08.906 --> 35:10.541
{\an1}Just make sure
that you tell me

35:10.608 --> 35:11.809
{\an1}what's going on
with you.

35:11.876 --> 35:14.278
You know I wouldn't
lie to you ever.

35:14.345 --> 35:17.615
Okay, so I may have not told
Rosa the whole truth,

35:17.682 --> 35:20.151
but until we decide
that we want to be exclusive,

35:20.218 --> 35:22.220
I don't want to tell her
every single little detail

35:22.286 --> 35:25.323
of what I'm doing
because it'll just hurt her,

35:25.389 --> 35:27.258
and that's the last thing
I want to do.

35:27.325 --> 35:29.193
Plus, I don't really want
to ruin the fun

35:29.260 --> 35:31.062
when I don't know where
my relationship is going

35:31.128 --> 35:33.097
with her or Safaree.

35:33.164 --> 35:34.198
Do you think there's
a difference

35:34.265 --> 35:36.501
between men and women
lovers?

35:36.567 --> 35:37.668
{\an1}What's the point
of having a (bleep)

35:37.735 --> 35:39.837
{\an1}if you can't use it
for the right reason?

35:39.904 --> 35:41.138
We don't have to worry
about these men.

35:41.205 --> 35:42.440
Oh, I don't.

35:41.205 --> 35:42.440
You shouldn't.

35:42.507 --> 35:43.774
'Cause I mean,
I don't feel like

35:43.841 --> 35:45.810
I give you a reason
to worry about nothing.

35:45.877 --> 35:48.312
{\an1}Not yet.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.579
I'm sure about me.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.348
{\an1}You're the one who subjected
me and my daughter

38:37.415 --> 38:38.482
to your mother.

38:38.549 --> 38:40.117
I trust my daughter's
judgment,

38:40.184 --> 38:42.153
but I do not understand

38:42.219 --> 38:46.924
why she thinks marrying A1
and all that comes with it

38:46.991 --> 38:49.627
with his ratchet-ass mama
is gonna work.

38:49.694 --> 38:51.996
Pam, you need to shut
your damn mouth

38:52.063 --> 38:53.998
and stay away from me.

38:54.065 --> 38:55.666
You got your (bleep)
daughter crying!

38:55.733 --> 38:57.268
{\an3}Chill!

38:55.733 --> 38:57.268
{\an1}You chill!

38:57.334 --> 38:59.370
You don't even
(bleep) care!

38:59.437 --> 39:00.905
No, Mama, shut up!

39:00.971 --> 39:02.239
{\an5}I'ma show...

39:00.971 --> 39:02.239
{\an3}Chill!

39:02.306 --> 39:04.008
Mama, be quiet!

39:04.075 --> 39:06.577
Y'all got me (bleep).
Chill!

39:06.644 --> 39:08.079
{\an5}You know I do that--

39:06.644 --> 39:08.079
Stop! Stop!

39:08.145 --> 39:10.548
I got a life and a career.
You get one.

39:10.614 --> 39:12.316
I don't understand
why you can't get along.

39:12.383 --> 39:14.051
The whole reason
that we sat here--

39:14.118 --> 39:15.553
Mama! Mama!

39:15.619 --> 39:17.621
{\an3}Be quiet!

39:15.619 --> 39:17.621
Hey! Hey! Mama!

39:17.688 --> 39:19.090
{\an3}I'm cool.

39:17.688 --> 39:19.090
You're not cool.

39:19.156 --> 39:20.291
{\an3}I am!

39:24.729 --> 39:27.064
{\an8}Next time on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"...

39:27.131 --> 39:28.666
{\an8}The right thing
to do for me

39:28.733 --> 39:31.235
{\an8}is upgrade you.

39:31.302 --> 39:32.536
{\an7}(gasps)

39:32.603 --> 39:33.804
{\an8}It's to the point
where I'm like,

39:33.871 --> 39:36.807
{\an8}"Yo, we should just
run off and elope."

39:36.874 --> 39:39.443
{\an7}Do you feel with
all of this dysfunction

39:39.510 --> 39:42.646
{\an8}you are willing to put
all those things aside?

39:42.713 --> 39:43.981
{\an7}Because when you
marry A1,

39:44.048 --> 39:46.984
{\an7}you're marrying
all of his issues.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.587
{\an8}(A1) It ain't about our parents.
It's about me and you.

39:49.653 --> 39:51.489
{\an8}So, you know,
I'm ready.

39:51.555 --> 39:53.324
{\an9}You ready?

39:53.390 --> 39:57.394
{\an8}So, I have a girl
and a guy in my life.

39:57.461 --> 39:59.196
{\an8}It's a girl and a guy.

39:59.263 --> 40:01.799
{\an7}You don't feel like you need
to tell somebody? One of them?

40:01.866 --> 40:04.034
{\an8}Like, I feel like I'm
living a double life.

40:04.101 --> 40:05.836
{\an8}All these women out here
are the same, bro.

40:05.903 --> 40:07.838
{\an8}She keeping options
available.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.640
{\an7}I'm not gonna be
a naive--

40:07.905 --> 40:09.640
{\an9}Oblivious.

40:09.707 --> 40:10.808
{\an8}You got to ask
yourself, too,

40:10.875 --> 40:12.777
{\an8}is there
a third party?

40:10.875 --> 40:12.777
{\an7}(scoffs)

40:12.843 --> 40:15.546
{\an8}Welcome to Hollywood.

40:15.613 --> 40:18.215
{\an7}I'm not (bleep)
or (bleep) nobody's (bleep)

40:18.282 --> 40:19.650
{\an8}or doing nothing
for you to be mad at.

40:19.717 --> 40:20.751
{\an8}I don't know that.

40:22.753 --> 40:24.255
{\an8}I finally want
to be heard.

40:24.321 --> 40:27.591
{\an8}I don't want to be looked at
as Willie's wife or the mama.

40:27.658 --> 40:29.727
{\an7}I was an artist before I was
any of those things.

40:29.794 --> 40:32.062
{\an7}I'm happy to see
that you're

40:32.129 --> 40:34.064
{\an7}not putting your dreams
on the back burner anymore.

40:34.131 --> 40:38.335
{\an8}We have a special guest
all the way from Chicago.

40:38.402 --> 40:40.237
{\an8}Everybody start clapping
right now

40:40.304 --> 40:43.874
{\an8}for Kai Reck, y'all.

40:43.941 --> 40:45.009
{\an8}Come over here, bitch.

40:45.075 --> 40:46.243
{\an8}(woman shrieking)
