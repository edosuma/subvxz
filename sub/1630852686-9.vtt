- Yeah.

09:21.895 --> 09:25.315

basically flew off.

09:26.275 --> 09:29.069
- What a... beautiful story.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.321
- Yeah. We got married, and we had Drew,

09:31.321 --> 09:33.824
and we've had a timeshare
in Aruba ever since.

09:33.824 --> 09:35.993
[gasps] Sophie,
you got to come down and see it.

09:35.993 --> 09:39.037
Our place has this beautiful
wall-to-wall carpet--

09:39.037 --> 09:40.122
- Oh, thanks.

09:40.122 --> 09:41.874
I-I don't think I can make it.

09:41.874 --> 09:44.084
- I'm booking you a ticket.
Are you a window or an aisle person?

09:44.084 --> 09:46.378
- No, do not book me
a ticket to Aruba! Okay?

09:46.378 --> 09:49.381
I... I'm breaking up with Drew.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.301

possible, sweetheart.

09:52.301 --> 09:53.260
- What?

09:53.844 --> 09:57.222
- Lou and I have a little bit of bad news
of our own to tell Drew,

09:57.222 --> 09:59.766
so you are not breaking up with him today.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.019
- I have to.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.770
I am trying to do the right thing here.

10:05.147 --> 10:06.732

10:07.191 --> 10:08.734

10:08.734 --> 10:10.527
- Fist up, kiddo. Let's do this.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.201
- Who do you guys think went in
for the kiss first?

10:17.201 --> 10:20.495
- Sophie! Right?
My girl is a modern woman.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.623
She sees what she wants,
and she goes for it.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.667
- Uh-uh. There is no way my guy didn't
go in for that kiss first, okay?

10:25.667 --> 10:28.337
His lean game is strong.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.923

10:30.923 --> 10:32.591
If Sophie and Jesse get married,

10:32.591 --> 10:34.843

my Goliath Market family discount!

10:34.843 --> 10:36.261
- Not in that outfit she won't.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.764
- Guys, two hot dorks hooked up.

10:38.764 --> 10:41.308
Okay, it is very exciting,
but I do think we are losing sight

10:41.308 --> 10:43.352
of what's really important here.

10:43.352 --> 10:45.771
- Yeah. You guys are kind of
burying the lede here.

10:45.771 --> 10:47.272
Sophie cheated on Drew.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.066
- Oh. I mean...

10:49.066 --> 10:50.609
yeah, but she's gonna end things today.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.612
And besides, this is
the good kind of cheating.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.322
[nervous groaning]
[slams laptop]

10:56.573 --> 10:59.409
And I'm guessing that was not
the right thing to say.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.786
- Drew's our friend, Sid.

11:00.786 --> 11:03.997
And I didn't know there was
a "good" kind of cheating.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.499
- I mean, of course there is.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.125
It's cheating that leads
to something good,

11:07.125 --> 11:10.337
like finding your person
or Beyoncé's Lemonade.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.589
- Yeah. Great. Amazing to know

11:12.589 --> 11:13.841
that I'm planning a wedding with a man

11:13.841 --> 11:16.760
who is so supportive of cheating.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.304
Oh, two weddings!
- Hannah, don't worry.

11:19.304 --> 11:22.057
Sophie's doing the right thing
and breaking up with Drew as we speak.

11:22.057 --> 11:23.433
- Rock-Paper-Scissors, shoot!
- Ha!

11:23.433 --> 11:24.852
- Ah, that one doesn't count, either.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.395
Your paper looked a lot like scissors.

11:26.395 --> 11:27.896
- I am doing the best I can.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.731
I told you I have early onset arthritis.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.526
- Look at the two of you.

11:32.526 --> 11:35.362
We're gone 30 minutes,
and you're practically sister-wives.

11:36.113 --> 11:37.990
- A joke that implies
Sophie's married to you

11:37.990 --> 11:40.784
or I'm married to Mom,
both of which are disgusting and illegal.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.538
- Hey, Drew, why don't I help you
toast the bagels in the kitchen?

11:44.538 --> 11:45.747
- Uh, speaking of toast,

11:45.747 --> 11:48.041
remember that guy Bernie Madoff?

11:48.584 --> 11:50.586
Your father committed similar crimes,

11:50.586 --> 11:53.046
and he lost a tremendous amount
of his clients' money,

11:53.046 --> 11:54.965
and he very possibly is going to jail.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.717
- What does that have to do with toast?
- Sweetheart,

11:56.717 --> 11:57.634
you're toast.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.555
- What? B-b-but,

12:12.774 --> 12:15.819
You still have your wonderful
girlfriend by your side,

12:15.819 --> 12:18.155

go through this alone.

Boop.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.251

12:31.251 --> 12:33.378
My uncle's at table four,
and he cheated on her.

12:33.378 --> 12:34.755
- Oh.
- But wait.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.465
According to you,
it was good cheating

12:36.465 --> 12:38.759
because he and his paralegal
are still together.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.969
- Someone didn't sleep on the plane.

to have all the facts
