like a move like that

16:24.149 --> 16:26.385
can really just pull us
into the 20th century.

16:26.452 --> 16:28.287
- Yeah, me too.
I'm just--

16:28.354 --> 16:31.323
I am kind of wondering, though,

16:31.390 --> 16:33.792
you know, if maybe we could
turn the poison off

16:33.859 --> 16:35.327
if it's just from right here?

16:35.394 --> 16:38.097
Like, maybe we can
cover it up or something?

16:38.163 --> 16:39.665
- No, 'cause that gets rid
of the ventilation.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.567
Then everyone gets COVID.

16:41.633 --> 16:43.402
So the answer to that is no.

16:43.469 --> 16:44.737
See the couch?

16:44.803 --> 16:45.904
You haven't even said
anything about it yet.

16:45.971 --> 16:47.106

of this design?

16:47.172 --> 16:48.307
Not bad, right?

16:48.374 --> 16:49.742
I had them cover it
with newspaper

16:49.808 --> 16:50.876
so you don't have to worry

16:50.943 --> 16:52.311
about your monthly
drippy drips.

16:52.378 --> 16:55.214
- I'm sorry, I-I don't mean
to be annoying, but the--

16:55.280 --> 16:56.949
regarding the poison--

16:57.015 --> 16:58.450
- What is the obsession
with the poison?

16:58.517 --> 17:00.486
There was a sign
on the front door.

17:00.552 --> 17:04.189
It said "Do not enter.
Bad poison. Will die."

17:04.256 --> 17:06.258
I un-taped that for you.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.394
- It said "Will die"?

17:08.460 --> 17:10.095
- You know what, Amy?
I'm sorry but it just feels

17:10.162 --> 17:11.830
like you're being
very ungrateful right now.

17:11.897 --> 17:13.632
I went to bat for you.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.402
I said, "Hey, fellas,
it seems like a tampon company

17:16.468 --> 17:18.837
should have at least one woman
on the board."

17:18.904 --> 17:20.839
I did that. For you.

17:20.906 --> 17:21.974
And now this.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.208
[sighs]

17:23.275 --> 17:24.576
All right, I guess this is
not good enough.

17:24.643 --> 17:25.911
- No, no, no, no.
- I guess my design...

17:25.978 --> 17:27.279
- No, no, no.
- That I laid out is

17:27.346 --> 17:30.048
just no good.
- No. No, it is.

17:30.115 --> 17:32.451
It's good. It's good.
It's good.

17:32.518 --> 17:35.187
- You know what?
I think they were right.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.990
Maybe you should never mentor
a woman.

17:38.056 --> 17:39.758
Or a person of color.

17:39.825 --> 17:41.860
Or all the different types
of gays.

17:41.927 --> 17:43.896
- No. No, no, no.

17:43.962 --> 17:45.497
I disrespected you.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.000
I did.
And I am so sorry for that.

17:48.066 --> 17:49.835
You have to forgive me.

17:49.902 --> 17:53.405
I think I'm
probably ovulating.

17:53.472 --> 17:56.074
And that is probably
why I'm so emotional.

17:56.141 --> 17:57.409
- That's what I was gonna say.
- Yeah.

17:57.476 --> 17:58.877
- But I didn't know
what the word was.

17:58.944 --> 18:01.747
- No, it's--there's--
yeah, just women, you know...

18:01.814 --> 18:05.250
[sighs] A week before, ten days
before their eggs drop--

18:05.317 --> 18:07.252
- That's the period?
- No. It's--

18:07.319 --> 18:08.620
- Are there eggs?
- That's the lining

18:08.687 --> 18:10.522
of your uterus.
That's--it drops out of your--

18:10.589 --> 18:12.057
out of your--
- But there's--

18:12.124 --> 18:14.793
are there eggs in the blood?
- No, there's eggs--[sighs]

18:14.860 --> 18:16.628
There's eggs in your ovaries.

18:16.695 --> 18:18.030
But I'm--I disrespected you

18:18.096 --> 18:20.299
and I should just be saying
"Thank you."

18:20.365 --> 18:22.267
You've been so generous to me.

18:22.334 --> 18:25.904
And let's just forget
about all of this, Boss.

18:26.638 --> 18:30.108
