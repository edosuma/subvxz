00:35.935 --> 00:37.003
>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:37.070 --> 00:37.937
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:38.004 --> 00:42.609
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:42.675 --> 00:43.209
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:43.276 --> 00:43.376
US.

00:43.443 --> 00:44.010
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:44.077 --> 00:44.644
THE WEEK, WHICH HAS BEEN BUSY.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.046
THE CDC EXPANDED ELIGIBILITY FOR

00:47.113 --> 00:48.381
BOOSTER SHOTS, THE HOUSE VOTED

00:48.448 --> 00:50.383
TO HOLD STEVE BANNON IN CONTEMPT

00:50.450 --> 00:51.317
OF CONGRESS, AND ADELE WORE THE

00:51.384 --> 00:52.685
SHIT OUT OF THIS HEAD TO TOE

00:52.752 --> 00:55.455
CHOCOLATE LEATHER OUTFIT.

00:55.522 --> 00:58.625
NO ONE'S WORN CHOCOLATE THAT

00:58.691 --> 01:02.262
WELL SINCE AUGUSTUS GLOOP.

01:02.328 --> 01:02.862
THAT'S A FASHION FACT.

01:02.929 --> 01:03.463
BUT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH

01:03.530 --> 01:03.663
THIS.

01:03.730 --> 01:04.164
>> IN POLICE DEPARTMENTS

01:04.230 --> 01:05.365
NATIONWIDE, A CRUSH OF VACCINE

01:05.432 --> 01:07.434
MANDATES ARE A FLASH POINT FOR

01:07.500 --> 01:10.637
OFFICERS FACED WITH ROLLING UP

01:10.703 --> 01:11.237
THEIR SLEEVES OR LOSING THEIR

01:11.304 --> 01:11.805
JOBS.

01:11.871 --> 01:13.540
>> IN LEESBURG, VIRGINIA, SOME

01:13.606 --> 01:14.808
OFFICERS SAY THEY MAY QUIT IF

01:14.874 --> 01:15.608
THE VACCINE MANDATE MOVES

01:15.675 --> 01:17.544
FORWARD.

01:17.610 --> 01:19.012
>> IN MASSACHUSETTS, THE STATE

01:19.078 --> 01:20.447
POLICE UNION BELIEVES AT LEAST

01:20.513 --> 01:22.081
150 STATE POLICE OFFICERS WILL

01:22.148 --> 01:23.516
RESIGN.

01:23.583 --> 01:24.918
>> ONE TROOPER WHO DECIDED TO

01:24.984 --> 01:25.552
QUIT HAD SOME CHOICE WORDS FOR

01:25.618 --> 01:27.320
THE GOVERNOR ON THE WAY OUT.

01:27.387 --> 01:28.888
>> THIS IS THE LAST TIME YOU'LL

01:28.955 --> 01:30.657
HEAR ME IN A STATE PATROL CAR.

01:30.723 --> 01:35.428
AND JAY INSLEE CAN KISS MY ASS.

01:35.495 --> 01:37.397
>> John: WOW, A WALKIE DROP!

01:37.464 --> 01:38.164
YOU DON'T SEE MANY OF THOSE!

01:38.231 --> 01:39.332
AND THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE IT

01:39.399 --> 01:41.234
LOOKS PATHETIC.

01:41.301 --> 01:42.869
DROPPING A MICROPHONE IS

01:42.936 --> 01:44.103
INHERENTLY EXCITING.

01:44.170 --> 01:45.738
YOU GET THE THUD AS IT HITS THE

01:45.805 --> 01:46.539
FLOOR, AND THE CHEER OF THE

01:46.606 --> 01:49.442
CROWD, BUT A WALKIE DROP?

01:49.509 --> 01:50.610
THAT'S JUST A SAD MAN SITTING IN

01:50.677 --> 01:52.378
A DARK CAR, DROPPING A HEAVY

01:52.445 --> 01:54.581
OBJECT DIRECTLY ONTO HIS PENIS.

01:54.647 --> 01:56.916
BUT IT'S TRUE.

01:56.983 --> 01:58.351
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, A SMALL

01:58.418 --> 01:59.686
MINORITY OF POLICE OFFICERS HAVE

01:59.752 --> 02:01.221
RECEIVED DISPROPORTIONATE

02:01.287 --> 02:02.689
COVERAGE AFTER THREATENING TO

02:02.755 --> 02:04.524
RESIGN OVER COVID MANDATES.

02:04.591 --> 02:05.592
THEY'VE FRAMED THIS AS A MATTER

02:05.658 --> 02:07.160
OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY, EVEN IN

02:07.227 --> 02:08.695
CASES WHERE VERY LITTLE WAS

02:08.761 --> 02:10.497
BEING ASKED OF THEM.

02:10.563 --> 02:11.998
IN CHICAGO, OFFICERS WERE MERELY

02:12.065 --> 02:13.366
ASKED TO REGISTER THEIR

02:13.433 --> 02:15.068
VACCINATION STATUS ON A PORTAL,

02:15.134 --> 02:16.703
AND FOR NOW CAN STILL WORK IF

02:16.769 --> 02:17.804
THEY'RE UNVACCINATED, SO LONG AS

02:17.871 --> 02:20.206
THEY'RE REGULARLY TESTED.

02:20.273 --> 02:21.774
BUT NEVERTHELESS, JOHN

02:21.841 --> 02:23.176
CATANZARA, THE HEAD OF CHICAGO'S

02:23.243 --> 02:24.911
FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE, TOLD

02:24.978 --> 02:26.746
HIS OFFICERS FLAT OUT, "DO NOT

02:26.813 --> 02:28.248
COMPLY WITH ANY DIRECT ORDER TO

02:28.314 --> 02:30.517
FILL OUT THE PORTAL, PERIOD."

02:30.583 --> 02:33.186
HE'S ACTUALLY BEEN ESPECIALLY

02:33.253 --> 02:33.853
VOCAL IN HIS OPPOSITION TO

02:33.920 --> 02:35.421
VACCINE MANDATES FOR OFFICERS,

02:35.488 --> 02:38.858
INCLUDING AN OFFENSIVE STATEMENT

02:38.925 --> 02:39.759
THAT I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT,

02:39.826 --> 02:40.593
I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW YOU HIS

02:40.660 --> 02:41.194
APOLOGY FOR IT, BECAUSE I DO

02:41.261 --> 02:42.128
THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO WORK IT

02:42.195 --> 02:43.496
OUT FROM CONTEXT.

02:43.563 --> 02:44.831
>> IN NO WAY WAS I TRYING TO TIE

02:44.898 --> 02:46.266
FORCED VACCINATIONS TO THE

02:46.332 --> 02:49.102
ATROCITIES OF THE HOLOCAUST,

02:49.168 --> 02:49.702
WHICH IS WHY I NEVER USED THE

02:49.769 --> 02:51.771
WORD HOLOCAUST.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.206
I SHOULD NOT HAVE MADE THE

02:53.273 --> 02:54.140
REFERENCE LIKE I DID TO THE

02:54.207 --> 02:58.311
SHOWERS AND FOR THAT I AM SORRY.

02:58.378 --> 02:59.879
>> John: WOW, JUST A BIG YIKES

02:59.946 --> 03:01.314
TO EVERYTHING GOING ON THERE.

03:01.381 --> 03:03.182
SETTING ASIDE THE PRONUNCIATION

03:03.249 --> 03:04.384
OF "HOLE-OCAUST" -- AND BELIEVE

03:04.450 --> 03:06.052
ME, I HAVE NOTHING BUT QUESTIONS

03:06.119 --> 03:07.520
ABOUT THAT -- ARGUING THAT,

03:07.587 --> 03:08.621
"TECHNICALLY I NEVER SAID THE

03:08.688 --> 03:10.790
WORD HOLOCAUST, I JUST

03:10.857 --> 03:13.593
REFERENCED THE SHOWERS" IS

03:13.660 --> 03:14.193
TOTALLY ABSURD.

03:14.260 --> 03:14.794
AND FINALLY -- AND THIS IS

03:14.861 --> 03:15.595
PROBABLY THE LEAST IMPORTANT

03:15.662 --> 03:17.063
THING TO SAY HERE -- AT LEAST

03:17.130 --> 03:17.797
CENTER YOURSELF IN THE FUCKING

03:17.864 --> 03:20.133
FRAME!

03:20.199 --> 03:21.067
IT'S JUST NOT THAT HARD!

03:21.134 --> 03:21.668
A QUICK SCOOTCH OF THE LAPTOP

03:21.734 --> 03:23.169
AND YOU'RE THERE.

03:23.236 --> 03:24.203
AND LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO BE IN

03:24.270 --> 03:25.605
THE BUSINESS OF ART DIRECTING

03:25.672 --> 03:27.974
"HOLE-OCAUST" NON-APOLOGIES, BUT

03:28.041 --> 03:31.110
FRANKLY, YOU'VE LEFT ME NO

03:31.177 --> 03:31.344
CHOICE.

03:31.411 --> 03:32.111
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW, EVEN BY THE

03:32.178 --> 03:34.047
SUBTERRANEAN STANDARDS OF THE

03:34.113 --> 03:37.183
CHICAGO PD, THIS GUY IS A LOT.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.685
HE HAS BEEN SUSPENDED EIGHT

03:38.751 --> 03:40.119
TIMES AND HAS RECEIVED MORE

03:40.186 --> 03:40.787
MISCONDUCT COMPLAINTS PER YEAR

03:40.853 --> 03:43.656
OF SERVICE THAN 96% OF HIS

03:43.723 --> 03:45.091
FELLOW CHICAGO OFFICERS.

03:45.158 --> 03:46.893
AND YET, THIS IS WHO HIS UNION

03:46.960 --> 03:49.095
MEMBERS CHOSE TO REPRESENT THEM.

03:49.162 --> 03:50.496
SO NEXT TIME SOMEONE SAYS TO

03:50.563 --> 03:52.632
YOU, "NOT ALL COPS ARE BAD," YOU

03:52.699 --> 03:54.267
CAN RESPOND, "NO, JUST THEIR

03:54.334 --> 03:56.703
FAVORITE ONES!"

03:56.769 --> 03:58.271
AND CATANZARA'S HOSTILITY TO A

03:58.338 --> 03:59.906
VACCINE MANDATE IS PARTICULARLY

03:59.973 --> 04:00.673
NOTEWORTHY GIVEN ONE OF HIS

04:00.740 --> 04:01.874
PREDECESSORS AS HEAD OF THE

04:01.941 --> 04:03.476
UNION DIED OF COVID JUST THIS

04:03.543 --> 04:05.945
MONTH.

04:06.012 --> 04:07.313
WHICH ACTUALLY BRINGS US TO A

04:07.380 --> 04:08.881
STAGGERING FACT.

04:08.948 --> 04:09.882
>> SINCE THE START OF THE

04:09.949 --> 04:11.551
PANDEMIC, MORE THAN FOUR TIMES

04:11.618 --> 04:13.486
AS MANY OFFICERS HAVE DIED FROM

04:13.553 --> 04:15.321
COVID-19 AS FROM GUNFIRE.

04:15.388 --> 04:16.289
THIS DESPITE BEING AMONG THE

04:16.356 --> 04:20.760
FIRST GROUPS TO HAVE ACCESS TO

04:20.827 --> 04:20.927
SHOW

04:20.994 --> 04:21.294
THE VACCINE.

04:21.361 --> 04:21.861
>> John: YEAH.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.029
FOUR TIMES MORE POLICE OFFICERS

04:23.096 --> 04:23.563
HAVE DIED FROM COVID THAN

04:23.630 --> 04:24.297
GUNFIRE.

04:24.364 --> 04:29.602
THAT'S A TERRIBLE STATISTIC,

04:29.669 --> 04:30.336
WHICH YOU MIGHT NOT FULLY

04:30.403 --> 04:30.970
ABSORB, GIVEN THAT CNN'S

04:31.037 --> 04:31.604
GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT REPRESENTED

04:31.671 --> 04:32.972
IT WITH ONE BAR THAT'S ONLY

04:33.039 --> 04:35.108
ABOUT TWICE AS BIG AS THE OTHER.

04:35.174 --> 04:35.975
SO WELCOME TO CNN.

04:36.042 --> 04:37.176
IF YOU WANT TO INSTANTLY

04:37.243 --> 04:38.378
UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT WAYS

04:38.444 --> 04:39.178
POLICE DIE, IT'S GOING TO BE

04:39.245 --> 04:40.546
TRICKY.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.181
BUT IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND

04:42.248 --> 04:43.449
THE ONE WAY A CERTAIN BRITISH

04:43.516 --> 04:45.485
ROYAL DIED, IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY!

04:45.551 --> 04:46.019
9:00 P.M. EASTERN, SUNDAY

04:46.085 --> 04:47.320
NIGHTS.

04:47.387 --> 04:48.454
THOUGH NO NEED TO WATCH.

04:48.521 --> 04:49.188
SPOILER ALERT, IT WAS THE

04:49.255 --> 04:52.225
MOTHER-IN-LAW.

04:52.291 --> 04:53.860
THERE'S ALSO THE KEY MATTER OF

04:53.926 --> 04:54.961
THE FACT THAT THE POLICE ARE

04:55.028 --> 04:55.495
SUPPOSED TO BE KEEPING THE

04:55.561 --> 04:56.896
PUBLIC SAFE.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.198
THAT'S THE POINT OF THEIR JOBS.

04:59.265 --> 05:01.701
YET SOME DON'T SEEM TO GIVE MUCH

05:01.768 --> 05:02.935
OF A SHIT ABOUT THAT.

05:03.002 --> 05:05.104
TAKE THIS VIDEO OF NYPD OFFICERS

05:05.171 --> 05:06.472
FLIPPING OUT OVER A SUBWAY RIDER

05:06.539 --> 05:07.640
WHO SIMPLY ASKED THEM TO PUT ON

05:07.707 --> 05:09.609
A MASK.

05:09.676 --> 05:10.977
>> CELL PHONE VIDEO TAKEN

05:11.044 --> 05:12.278
TUESDAY MORNING SHOWS AN

05:12.345 --> 05:14.814
UNMASKED NYPD OFFICER PUSHING A

05:14.881 --> 05:17.250
MASKED COMMUTER OUT OF THE 8TH

05:17.316 --> 05:18.017
STREET SUBWAY STATION AND

05:18.084 --> 05:21.254
CLOSING THE EMERGENCY EXIT DOOR.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.489
AS THE COP WALKS AWAY, HE SAYS.

05:23.556 --> 05:25.558
>> YOU'RE BEING DISRUPTIVE.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.927
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, YOU OPENED

05:27.994 --> 05:28.895
THE EMERGENCY DOOR?

05:28.961 --> 05:30.329
OH, NO!

05:30.396 --> 05:32.231
EVERYONE IN NEW YORK KNOWS YOU

05:32.298 --> 05:35.234
CAN'T OPEN THE EMERGENCY DOOR!

05:35.301 --> 05:37.804
NOT UNLESS IT'S AN EMERGENCY!

05:37.870 --> 05:39.806
ALSO, DISRUPTIVE?

05:39.872 --> 05:40.573
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ON THE

05:40.640 --> 05:42.241
SUBWAY?

05:42.308 --> 05:43.342
YOU KNOW, THE BIG METAL WORM

05:43.409 --> 05:44.544
THAT SCREAMS?

05:44.610 --> 05:46.813
THE PLACE WHERE EVERY DAY, YOU

05:46.879 --> 05:48.114
SEE THE BIGGEST RAT TO EVER WALK

05:48.181 --> 05:49.215
THE EARTH AND THEN YOU JUST GO

05:49.282 --> 05:53.086
TO WORK LIKE IT'S NOTHING?

05:53.152 --> 05:54.420
YOU'RE IN DISRUPTION JUNCTION,

05:54.487 --> 05:55.388
BABY.

05:55.455 --> 05:56.355
IT'S ALSO WORTH REMEMBERING THAT

05:56.422 --> 05:57.190
NEW YORK STILL HAS A MASK

05:57.256 --> 05:58.458
MANDATE ON PUBLIC TRANSIT, AND

05:58.524 --> 06:00.326
ANYONE CAUGHT WITHOUT ONE RISKS

06:00.393 --> 06:01.761
A $50 FINE -- EXCEPT,

06:01.828 --> 06:05.264
APPARENTLY, THE COPS.

06:05.331 --> 06:05.965
AND THIS ALL SUMS UP THE

06:06.032 --> 06:06.532
AMERICAN POLICE PROBLEM IN

06:06.599 --> 06:07.834
MINIATURE.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.001
THE CONSTANT REFRAIN WE HEAR

06:09.068 --> 06:11.237
FROM COPS EVERY TIME THEY KILL

06:11.304 --> 06:12.739
AN UNARMED BLACK PERSON IS "THEY

06:12.805 --> 06:13.706
SHOULD HAVE COMPLIED WITH

06:13.773 --> 06:14.540
COMMANDS," BECAUSE AS LONG AS

06:14.607 --> 06:15.441
YOU COMPLY, THINGS WILL

06:15.508 --> 06:18.144
SUPPOSEDLY GO WELL.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.011
BUT THAT ONLY SEEMS TO WORK ONE

06:19.078 --> 06:21.314
WAY.

06:21.380 --> 06:22.415
BECAUSE WHEN OFFICERS ARE ASKED

06:22.482 --> 06:23.015
TO FOLLOW SIMPLE RULES OR FACE

06:23.082 --> 06:24.250
CONSEQUENCES, A NOT

06:24.317 --> 06:26.819
INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THEM

06:26.886 --> 06:27.653
FLIP THEIR SHIT.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.288
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:29.355 --> 06:30.823
IF AN OFFICER WANTS TO QUIT OVER

06:30.890 --> 06:37.463
THIS, FUCKING LET THEM.

06:37.530 --> 06:38.097
LET THE INDIVIDUALS WHO CLEARLY

06:38.164 --> 06:38.698
DON'T CARE ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY

06:38.765 --> 06:39.298
STOP BEING IN CHARGE OF PUBLIC

06:39.365 --> 06:41.501
SAFETY.

06:41.567 --> 06:45.304
IT IS REALLY THAT SIMPLE.

06:45.371 --> 06:46.773
AND, BY THE WAY, THAT IS A

06:46.839 --> 06:47.373
MOTHERFUCKING WALKIE DROP.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.007
OW.

06:48.074 --> 06:52.678
AND NOW THIS.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.847
>> AND NOW, THE WEATHER

06:54.914 --> 06:57.016
CHANNEL'S GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT IS

06:57.083 --> 07:01.187
STILL NOT FUCKING AROUND.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.256
>> LET'S TAKE THIS CAR INTO

07:03.322 --> 07:05.124
AUGMENTED REALITY AND TALK ABOUT

07:05.191 --> 07:06.125
HOW THE WEATHER IMPACTS YOUR

07:06.192 --> 07:06.359
TRAVEL.

07:06.425 --> 07:08.494
>> YOU TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF LIKE

07:08.561 --> 07:09.962
THAT TO GET TO YOUR SPOT.

07:10.029 --> 07:12.265
>> BEING CLOSE TO A RAGING

07:12.331 --> 07:14.433
WILDFIRE LIKE THIS ONE IS A

07:14.500 --> 07:15.134
TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE.

07:15.201 --> 07:16.702
>> YOU CAN SEE LARGE OBJECTS, A

07:16.769 --> 07:20.273
TRUCK RIGHT HERE.

07:20.339 --> 07:21.107
THOSE SNOWMOBILES CAN REALLY

07:21.174 --> 07:23.042
PICK UP SPEED.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.877
>> WAS AS A TRULY

07:24.944 --> 07:25.845
LIFE-THREATENING.

07:25.912 --> 07:27.180
>> THIS IS AN SUV.

07:27.246 --> 07:30.016
>> YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING, A

07:30.082 --> 07:30.917
BUS?

07:30.983 --> 07:32.518
I HOPE THIS BUS STOPS.

07:32.585 --> 07:34.387
>> YOU MIGHT GET CAUGHT

07:34.453 --> 07:38.658
OFF GUARD.

07:38.724 --> 07:40.626
>> TREES AND STARTED TO COME

07:40.693 --> 07:40.827
DOWN.

07:40.893 --> 07:41.828
>> WHAT'S THAT?

07:41.894 --> 07:47.633
THAT'S THE MAGIC TOP HAT.

07:47.700 --> 07:48.634
THE SCENE WITH THE FOG IS

07:48.701 --> 07:51.304
GETTING PRETTY SPOOKY.

07:51.370 --> 07:53.706
WATCH OUT, HE IS COMING FOR YOU.

07:53.773 --> 07:54.574
WHERE IS MY BROOM?

07:54.640 --> 08:06.252
THIS WHICH IS OUT OF HERE.

08:06.319 --> 08:06.686
>> John: MOVING ON.

08:06.752 --> 08:07.320
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

08:07.386 --> 08:07.553
TAIWAN.

08:07.620 --> 08:08.221
IT'S HONESTLY REMARKABLE THAT WE

08:08.287 --> 08:09.522
HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT TAIWAN

08:09.589 --> 08:10.256
BEFORE ON THIS SHOW GIVEN IT'S

08:10.323 --> 08:10.857
THE BIRTHPLACE OF BUBBLE TEA,

08:10.923 --> 08:12.024
WHICH IS DELICIOUS, EVEN THOUGH

08:12.091 --> 08:13.626
TAPIOCA BALLS SOUNDS LIKE A SEX

08:13.693 --> 08:16.362
MOVE FOR PEOPLE OVER 70, AND

08:16.429 --> 08:17.530
ESPECIALLY SINCE TAIWAN SHARES

08:17.597 --> 08:19.398
OUR UNHEALTHY OBSESSION WITH

08:19.465 --> 08:20.066
MASCOTS, CITIES THERE MAKE TONS

08:20.132 --> 08:22.335
OF THEM.

08:22.401 --> 08:23.269
THERE'S THIS ONE, THE MILKFISH

08:23.336 --> 08:24.003
KID, CELEBRATING ONE AREA'S

08:24.070 --> 08:26.205
MILKFISH PRODUCTION.

08:26.272 --> 08:27.073
AND THERE'S THIS ONE, FROM A

08:27.139 --> 08:27.807
REGION THAT PRODUCES BANANAS,

08:27.874 --> 08:28.674
WHICH I DO NOT WANT TO TALK

08:28.741 --> 08:30.610
ABOUT.

08:30.676 --> 08:31.978
IN FACT, TAIWAN MAKES SO MANY

08:32.044 --> 08:34.046
MASCOTS THAT IN SOME CITIES, THE

08:34.113 --> 08:35.114
VERY ACT OF STORING THEM HAS

08:35.181 --> 08:36.949
BECOME A PROBLEM.

08:37.016 --> 08:38.451
>> WE WENT WITH THE CITY

08:38.517 --> 08:40.086
COUNCILOR TO A TAIPEI PUBLIC

08:40.152 --> 08:41.387
SCHOOL FOLLOWING HER INTO THE

08:41.454 --> 08:42.054
DEPTHS OF A BASEMENT PARKING

08:42.121 --> 08:43.823
LOT.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.157
HERE BEHIND A DOOR, WE

08:45.224 --> 08:45.958
DISCOVERED A MOUNTAIN OF

08:46.025 --> 08:51.664
ABANDONED MASCOTS.

08:51.731 --> 08:52.999
THIS IS SACRED FIRE BABY FROM

08:53.065 --> 08:54.233
2013 NATIONAL GAMES HELD IN

08:54.300 --> 08:58.237
TAIPEI.

08:58.304 --> 08:59.605
>> THE CITY GOVERNMENT SHOULD

08:59.672 --> 09:00.940
REALLY THINK ABOUT WHETHER IT'S

09:01.007 --> 09:01.474
NECESSARY TO KEEP CREATING

09:01.540 --> 09:03.743
ONE-OFF MASCOTS.

09:03.809 --> 09:06.145
>> John: OH, COME ON.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.613
YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP MAKING

09:07.680 --> 09:09.282
MASCOTS AND THROWING THEM AWAY.

09:09.348 --> 09:10.483
THANKFULLY, AT THE END OF EACH

09:10.549 --> 09:13.219
OF OUR SEASONS, OUR MASCOTS GO

09:13.286 --> 09:13.786
TO LIVE ON A BEAUTIFUL FARM.

09:13.853 --> 09:15.655
A FANTASTIC GREEN FARM, WHERE

09:15.721 --> 09:16.222
JEFF THE DISEASED LUNG CAN

09:16.289 --> 09:18.357
BREATHE FRESH AIR, AND THE POLAR

09:18.424 --> 09:19.692
BEAR WITH A BROKEN PENIS CAN GET

09:19.759 --> 09:22.128
THE CARE HE SO BADLY NEEDS.

09:22.194 --> 09:22.895
I KEEP ASKING MY PRODUCER WHERE

09:22.962 --> 09:24.563
THIS FARM IS, AND SHE KEEPS

09:24.630 --> 09:25.231
SAYING, "I'LL TELL YOU WHEN

09:25.298 --> 09:26.132
YOU'RE OLDER."

09:26.198 --> 09:29.302
I CAN'T WAIT!

09:29.368 --> 09:30.603
BUT OBVIOUSLY, THE MAJOR REASON

09:30.670 --> 09:32.104
TAIWAN ENDS UP IN THE NEWS THESE

09:32.171 --> 09:33.572
DAYS IS BECAUSE OF ITS

09:33.639 --> 09:34.440
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA, WHICH,

09:34.507 --> 09:40.813
TO PUT IT MILDLY, IS FRAUGHT.

09:40.880 --> 09:41.380
AND RECENTLY, GETTING EVEN

09:41.447 --> 09:41.681
FRAUGHTER.

09:41.747 --> 09:42.548
>> CHINA HAS LONG VIEWED TAIWAN

09:42.615 --> 09:44.216
AS ITS OWN NATIONAL TERRITORY.

09:44.283 --> 09:45.251
CHINA'S PRESIDENT, XI JINPING,

09:45.318 --> 09:46.852
ON SATURDAY ALL BUT DECLARING IT

09:46.919 --> 09:48.754
POLICY.

09:48.821 --> 09:50.389
"THE COMPLETE REUNIFICATION OF

09:50.456 --> 09:52.391
OUR COUNTRY MUST BE AND WILL BE

09:52.458 --> 09:53.759
REALIZED," HE SAID.

09:53.826 --> 09:55.428
>> MILITARY TENSIONS BETWEEN THE

09:55.494 --> 09:56.696
TWO SIDES ARE SOARING.

09:56.762 --> 09:59.932
CHINA'S AIR FORCE SENT NEARLY

09:59.999 --> 10:00.833
150 PLANES INTO TAIWAN'S AIR

10:00.900 --> 10:01.500
DEFENSE ZONE SINCE THE START OF

10:01.567 --> 10:02.835
THIS MONTH.

10:02.902 --> 10:07.206
>> John: YEAH.

10:07.273 --> 10:07.807
THEY DID.

10:07.873 --> 10:08.407
NOT EXACTLY LIKE THAT, THOUGH,

10:08.474 --> 10:09.208
IN A BIG STACK.

10:09.275 --> 10:09.976
I'M PRESUMING THEY FLEW THE

10:10.042 --> 10:11.010
PLANES OUT ONE AT A TIME, NOT

10:11.077 --> 10:12.445
HEAPED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER LIKE

10:12.511 --> 10:13.412
AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER'S

10:13.479 --> 10:16.315
NIGHTMARE.

10:16.382 --> 10:17.717
THE POINT IS, CHINA INSISTS THAT

10:17.783 --> 10:18.818
TAIWAN, AN INDEPENDENTLY

10:18.884 --> 10:19.885
OPERATING ENTITY WITH ITS OWN

10:19.952 --> 10:21.454
DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED LEADERS,

10:21.520 --> 10:23.489
ARMED FORCES, AND CONSTITUTION,

10:23.556 --> 10:25.458
IS ACTUALLY PART OF CHINA, AND

10:25.524 --> 10:27.560
IN NO WAY A SEPARATE COUNTRY.

10:27.626 --> 10:30.029
HERE'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

10:30.096 --> 10:30.596
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT FEELS

10:30.663 --> 10:33.132
STRONGLY ABOUT THIS.

10:33.199 --> 10:34.800
SO STRONGLY, IN FACT, THAT WHEN

10:34.867 --> 10:35.668
JOHN CENA WENT ON A PRESS TOUR

10:35.735 --> 10:37.036
FOR THE MOST RECENT "FAST &

10:37.103 --> 10:38.337
FURIOUS" MOVIE AND SAID TAIWAN

10:38.404 --> 10:40.206
IS THE FIRST "COUNTRY" THAT CAN

10:40.272 --> 10:41.107
WATCH "F9," THIS IS WHAT

10:41.173 --> 10:42.875
HAPPENED NEXT.

10:42.942 --> 10:44.910
>> ACTOR JOHN CENA HAS

10:44.977 --> 10:46.412
APOLOGIZED TO CHINA AFTER HE

10:46.479 --> 10:56.522
CALLED TAIWAN A COUNTRY.

10:56.589 --> 11:07.500
>> [SPEAKING MANDARIN]

11:07.566 --> 11:09.969
>> John: EVERY PART OF THAT IS

11:10.036 --> 11:10.903
SO WEIRD.

11:10.970 --> 11:11.704
IT'S WEIRD JOHN CENA APOLOGIZED

11:11.771 --> 11:12.671
TO CHINA.

11:12.738 --> 11:13.973
IT'S WEIRD HE DID IT FOR CALLING

11:14.040 --> 11:15.041
TAIWAN A "COUNTRY."

11:15.107 --> 11:17.043
AND IT'S WEIRD TO SEE HIM DO IT

11:17.109 --> 11:18.577
IN PRETTY DECENT MANDARIN.

11:18.644 --> 11:20.613
THAT'S JUST TOO MANY WEIRD

11:20.679 --> 11:20.846
THINGS!

11:20.913 --> 11:22.381
I HALF EXPECT THAT SHOT TO PAN

11:22.448 --> 11:23.382
OUT TO REVEAL HE'S ALSO DOING A

11:23.449 --> 11:24.550
NEEDLEPOINT OF LIAM NEESON

11:24.617 --> 11:25.684
KISSING AN OSTRICH.

11:25.751 --> 11:27.186
HONESTLY, IT WOULD ONLY MAKE IT

11:27.253 --> 11:29.155
SLIGHTLY STRANGER.

11:29.221 --> 11:32.925
BUT JOHN CENA ISN'T ALONE.

11:32.992 --> 11:34.026
TAIWAN IS SUCH A THIRD RAIL FOR

11:34.093 --> 11:35.261
CHINA THAT IT MAY BE WHY

11:35.327 --> 11:36.462
PARAMOUNT PICTURES REMOVED THE

11:36.529 --> 11:37.563
TAIWANESE FLAG FROM TOM CRUISE'S

11:37.630 --> 11:39.799
JACKET FOR THE "TOP GUN" SEQUEL,

11:39.865 --> 11:41.767
AND IT'S DEFINITELY WHY THE GAP

11:41.834 --> 11:42.802
APOLOGIZED FOR RELEASING THIS

11:42.868 --> 11:44.136
T-SHIRT FEATURING A MAP OF CHINA

11:44.203 --> 11:47.506
WITHOUT TAIWAN ATTACHED.

11:47.573 --> 11:49.408
THAT SHIRT CAUSED A SHITSTORM,

11:49.475 --> 11:50.943
AND IT LED TO THE GAP, MAKERS OF

11:51.010 --> 11:54.547
THE T-SHIRT DADS WEAR WHILE

11:54.613 --> 12:00.052
THEY'RE ON THE ELLIPTICAL FOR

12:00.119 --> 12:00.653
30 MINUTES, APOLOGIZING TO 1.4

12:00.719 --> 12:01.020
BILLION PEOPLE.

12:01.087 --> 12:05.124
SO IF CHINA IS GETTING T-SHIRT

12:05.191 --> 12:05.791
RETRACTIONS FROM THE GAP, LOUDLY

12:05.858 --> 12:06.659
VOWING TO REUNIFY WITH TAIWAN

12:06.725 --> 12:07.927
AND SENDING STACKS OF WAR PLANES

12:07.993 --> 12:08.928
TOWARDS IT IN RECORD-BREAKING

12:08.994 --> 12:10.096
NUMBERS, IT FEELS LIKE TONIGHT,

12:10.162 --> 12:11.664
IT'D BE WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT

12:11.730 --> 12:13.099
TAIWAN, HOW IT GOT TO BE IN THE

12:13.165 --> 12:15.267
UNIQUE POSITION IT'S IN, WHAT

12:15.334 --> 12:16.402
THE WORLD WANTS FROM IT, AND

12:16.469 --> 12:17.436
MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT IT WANTS

12:17.503 --> 12:19.371
FOR ITSELF.

12:19.438 --> 12:20.406
AND LET'S START WITH HOW WE GOT

12:20.473 --> 12:23.309
HERE.

12:23.375 --> 12:23.943
HISTORICALLY, TAIWAN HAS BEEN

12:24.009 --> 12:25.344
LIKE THE STANLEY CUP OF ASIAN

12:25.411 --> 12:26.178
HISTORY, IN THAT DIFFERENT

12:26.245 --> 12:28.781
PEOPLE KEEP PASSING IT AROUND

12:28.848 --> 12:30.649
AND CARVING THEIR NAMES ON IT.

12:30.716 --> 12:31.717
HERE'S A LUDICROUSLY BRIEF

12:31.784 --> 12:32.518
HISTORY OF THE LAST 400 YEARS

12:32.585 --> 12:34.487
THERE.

12:34.553 --> 12:35.254
TAIWAN, OR AS IT'S SOMETIMES

12:35.321 --> 12:36.689
BEEN CALLED, "FORMOSA," WAS

12:36.755 --> 12:38.224
FIRST HOME TO INDIGENOUS PEOPLE,

12:38.290 --> 12:39.291
THEN COLONIZED BY THE DUTCH, AND

12:39.358 --> 12:41.060
BRIEFLY THE SPANISH, BEFORE

12:41.127 --> 12:42.828
CHINA'S QING DYNASTY HELD IT FOR

12:42.895 --> 12:44.997
ABOUT 200 YEARS.

12:45.064 --> 12:46.699
THEN, IN 1895, CHINA LOST TAIWAN

12:46.765 --> 12:48.734
TO JAPAN, WHICH TURNED IT INTO A

12:48.801 --> 12:50.836
SO-CALLED "MODEL COLONY,"

12:50.903 --> 12:51.904
IMPOSING JAPANESE CULTURAL

12:51.971 --> 12:53.172
VALUES, AND GENERALLY RULING IT

12:53.239 --> 12:54.507
WITH AN IRON FIST.

12:54.573 --> 12:56.575
THEN, AFTER WORLD WAR II, TWO

12:56.642 --> 12:59.178
MAJOR THINGS HAPPENED.

12:59.245 --> 13:00.146
FIRST, THE ALLIES PUT TAIWAN

13:00.212 --> 13:01.614
BACK UNDER CHINESE CONTROL.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.083
AND SECOND, THE CIVIL WAR THAT

13:04.150 --> 13:04.717
WAS TAKING PLACE IN CHINA

13:04.783 --> 13:05.384
BETWEEN THE NATIONALIST

13:05.451 --> 13:06.585
GOVERNMENT LED BY CHIANG

13:06.652 --> 13:08.287
KAI-SHEK AND THE COMMUNISTS, LED

13:08.354 --> 13:10.156
BY MAO ZEDONG, ENDED.

13:10.222 --> 13:11.223
SPOILER ALERT, THE COMMUNISTS

13:11.290 --> 13:13.325
WON.

13:13.392 --> 13:15.094
CONGRATULATIONS TO MAO.

13:15.161 --> 13:17.563
AND IN THE WAKE OF THAT DEFEAT,

13:17.630 --> 13:18.764
CHIANG KAI-SHEK FLED TO TAIWAN,

13:18.831 --> 13:21.100
ALONG WITH 2 MILLION NATIONALIST

13:21.167 --> 13:22.268
SOLDIERS AND REFUGEES, BASICALLY

13:22.334 --> 13:24.036
SETTING UP A CHINESE GOVERNMENT

13:24.103 --> 13:25.070
IN EXILE.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.106
MEANING CHINA TECHNICALLY HAD

13:27.173 --> 13:28.574
TWO GOVERNMENTS AT THE TIME, ONE

13:28.641 --> 13:31.343
IN CHINA, AND ONE IN TAIWAN.

13:31.410 --> 13:33.846
AND WESTERN COUNTRIES WERE VERY

13:33.913 --> 13:34.680
INVESTED IN THE SUCCESS OF THE

13:34.747 --> 13:36.015
SECOND ONE, EVEN CALLING TAIWAN

13:36.081 --> 13:39.218
"FREE CHINA," BECAUSE THEY SAW

13:39.285 --> 13:40.019
IT AS A NECESSARY BULWARK

13:40.085 --> 13:41.620
AGAINST COMMUNISM.

13:41.687 --> 13:43.756
>> AGAINST ALL PROPHECIES,

13:43.822 --> 13:44.790
FORMOSA STILL KEEPS THE

13:44.857 --> 13:46.525
ANTI-COMMUNIST FLAG FLYING ONLY

13:46.592 --> 13:47.159
100 MILES OR SO OFF THE MAINLAND

13:47.226 --> 13:48.827
OF CHINA.

13:48.894 --> 13:50.529
IT'S A PROSPEROUS ISLAND WHERE

13:50.596 --> 13:51.163
THE NEW GENERATIONS GROW UP IN

13:51.230 --> 13:52.665
FREEDOM.

13:52.731 --> 13:53.933
A COMPLETE CONTRAST TO

13:53.999 --> 13:54.633
CONDITIONS UNDER THE RULE OF MAO

13:54.700 --> 13:57.036
TSE-TUNG.

13:57.102 --> 13:58.237
>> John: I DO MISS THAT PERIOD

13:58.304 --> 13:59.305
OF HUMAN HISTORY WHERE THE ONLY

13:59.371 --> 14:00.172
WAY TO LEARN ABOUT OTHER

14:00.239 --> 14:01.874
CULTURES WAS TO HAVE A BRITISH

14:01.941 --> 14:03.275
MAN ON AMPHETAMINES TELL YOU

14:03.342 --> 14:04.243
WHICH WERE THE GOOD ONES AND

14:04.310 --> 14:05.945
WHICH WERE THE BADDIES.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.313
"HERE WE SEE FORMOSANS LIVING IN

14:07.379 --> 14:08.480
FREEDOM.

14:08.547 --> 14:09.582
WELL, NOT FREEDOM PER SE, BUT

14:09.648 --> 14:10.449
THE POINT IS, THEY'RE NOT

14:10.516 --> 14:11.450
COMMIES, AND THAT'S WHERE MY

14:11.517 --> 14:15.254
CURIOSITY TERMINATES."

14:15.321 --> 14:16.689
BUT WHILE CHIANG KAI-SHEK MIGHT

14:16.755 --> 14:17.957
HAVE BEEN A STAUNCHLY

14:18.023 --> 14:19.225
ANTI-COMMUNIST U.S. ALLY,

14:19.291 --> 14:20.826
HISTORICALLY, WE'VE HAD A LOT OF

14:20.893 --> 14:22.228
THOSE, AND THEY OFTEN HAVEN'T

14:22.294 --> 14:24.563
BEEN GREAT PEOPLE.

14:24.630 --> 14:25.931
AND CHIANG RULED TAIWAN AS A

14:25.998 --> 14:28.801
BRUTAL AUTHORITARIAN.

14:28.867 --> 14:30.536
>> THOUSANDS WERE SWEPT UP IN A

14:30.603 --> 14:31.704
PERIOD THAT CAME TO BE KNOWN AS

14:31.770 --> 14:32.771
"THE WHITE TERROR," SUFFERING

14:32.838 --> 14:33.339
IMPRISONMENT, TORTURE, EVEN

14:33.405 --> 14:36.175
EXECUTION.

14:36.242 --> 14:37.343
DOING ANYTHING THAT COULD BE

14:37.409 --> 14:38.911
REMOTELY CONSTRUED AS CRITICISM

14:38.978 --> 14:40.679
OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS EXTREMELY

14:40.746 --> 14:42.047
RISKY, AS ONE WRITER DISCOVERED

14:42.114 --> 14:43.649
WHEN HE MERELY TRANSLATED A

14:43.716 --> 14:49.622
POPEYE COMIC STRIP.

14:49.688 --> 14:51.190
>> POPEYE AND HIS SON WERE IN

14:51.257 --> 14:52.725
EXILE ON AN ISLAND AND THEY WERE

14:52.791 --> 14:56.295
CAMPAIGNING FOR ELECTION THERE.

14:56.362 --> 14:57.796
POPEYE GAVE A SPEECH AND USED AN

14:57.863 --> 15:01.033
ENGLISH WORD, "FELLOWS."

15:01.100 --> 15:02.501
THERE COULD BE HUNDREDS OF

15:02.568 --> 15:04.103
TRANSLATIONS FOR "FELLOWS," BUT

15:04.169 --> 15:05.571
I CHOSE ONE WHICH WAS, "ALL MY

15:05.638 --> 15:08.907
FELLOW COUNTRYMEN."

15:08.974 --> 15:10.776
THIS WAS TERRIBLE.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.144
THE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

15:12.211 --> 15:13.345
ARRESTED ME SAYING, "WHY DIDN'T

15:13.412 --> 15:14.213
YOU TRANSLATE IT INTO SOMETHING

15:14.280 --> 15:15.514
ELSE?

15:15.581 --> 15:16.982
THIS IS EXACTLY THE WAY OUR

15:17.049 --> 15:22.321
PRESIDENT CHIANG SPEAKS.

15:22.388 --> 15:23.689
YOU ARE MAKING FUN OF HIM.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.324
IT DESERVES THE DEATH PENALTY,

15:25.391 --> 15:30.663
NO DOUBT, THE DEATH PENALTY."

15:30.729 --> 15:31.096
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

15:31.163 --> 15:31.864
THAT GUY WAS INTERROGATED FOR

15:31.930 --> 15:32.464
MONTHS ON SUSPICION OF BEING A

15:32.531 --> 15:33.165
COMMUNIST COLLABORATOR, AND

15:33.232 --> 15:34.133
ULTIMATELY SPENT NINE YEARS IN

15:34.199 --> 15:35.801
PRISON, ALL BECAUSE CHIANG'S

15:35.868 --> 15:37.336
GOVERNMENT THOUGHT A POPEYE

15:37.403 --> 15:38.437
COMIC HAD A HIDDEN POLITICAL

15:38.504 --> 15:40.005
MESSAGE.

15:40.072 --> 15:41.807
WHICH IS A BIT OF A REACH.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.342
THERE IS CLEARLY NO DEEPER

15:43.409 --> 15:44.310
MEANING TO POPEYE COMICS, OTHER

15:44.376 --> 15:45.711
THAN WOMEN ARE INHERENTLY PRIZES

15:45.778 --> 15:47.813
TO BE FOUGHT OVER, PERFORMANCE

15:47.880 --> 15:49.648
ENHANCING DRUGS ARE COOL, AND

15:49.715 --> 15:51.917
BLUTO DOESN'T DESERVE LOVE.

15:51.984 --> 15:53.819
ALL OF WHICH IS TO SAY, IN THE

15:53.886 --> 15:55.154
MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY,

15:55.220 --> 15:57.923
TAIWAN WAS A GRIM PLACE.

15:57.990 --> 16:00.626
BUT AFTER CHIANG DIED IN 1975,

16:00.693 --> 16:01.694
UNDER PRESSURE BOTH

16:01.760 --> 16:02.728
INTERNATIONALLY AND FROM

16:02.795 --> 16:04.330
POLITICAL MOVEMENTS AT HOME, THE

16:04.396 --> 16:06.065
NATIONALISTS BEGAN TO LOOSEN

16:06.131 --> 16:07.066
THEIR GRIP, ENDING MARTIAL LAW

16:07.132 --> 16:08.200
IN THE LATE '80s AND OPENING THE

16:08.267 --> 16:10.035
DOOR TO FULL DEMOCRATIZATION.

16:10.102 --> 16:12.504
SO AGAINST THE ODDS, TAIWAN

16:12.571 --> 16:14.540
SHIFTED FROM A DICTATORSHIP TO A

16:14.606 --> 16:15.941
FUNCTIONING, VIBRANT DEMOCRACY,

16:16.008 --> 16:19.278
AND I DO MEAN VIBRANT.

16:19.345 --> 16:20.446
>> A DEBATE OVER HOW BILLIONS OF

16:20.512 --> 16:22.514
EUROS WOULD BE ALLOCATED FOR AN

16:22.581 --> 16:23.382
INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

16:23.449 --> 16:24.383
DESCENDED INTO A BRAWL IN

16:24.450 --> 16:27.586
TAIWAN'S PARLIAMENT ON TUESDAY.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.254
MEMBERS OF THE RULING DEMOCRATIC

16:29.321 --> 16:29.788
PROGRESSIVE PARTY AND THE

16:29.855 --> 16:32.024
OPPOSITION NATIONALISTS PARTY

16:32.091 --> 16:32.958
THREW WATER AND SHOVED EACH

16:33.025 --> 16:35.394
OTHER TO THE FLOOR.

16:35.461 --> 16:36.695
TAIWAN'S MPS ARE KNOWN FOR

16:36.762 --> 16:37.363
BRAWLING AND EVEN THROWING

16:37.429 --> 16:39.398
OBJECTS AT EACH OTHER.

16:39.465 --> 16:41.400
AND FIGHTS IN PARLIAMENT ARE

16:41.467 --> 16:42.468
EVEN SEEN AS ONE WAY FOR THE

16:42.534 --> 16:44.236
OPPOSITION TO SHOW VOTERS THAT

16:44.303 --> 16:46.505
IT STANDS TOUGH ON ISSUES.

16:46.572 --> 16:47.606
>> John: YEAH!

16:47.673 --> 16:49.608
FIGHTING IS NOT UNCOMMON IN

16:49.675 --> 16:51.877
TAIWAN'S PARLIAMENT.

16:51.944 --> 16:52.644
HERE THEY ARE THROWING WATER

16:52.711 --> 16:54.513
BALLOONS AT EACH OTHER.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.382
AND HERE THEY ARE HURLING PIG

16:56.448 --> 16:57.549
GUTS DURING A DEBATE ON PORK

16:57.616 --> 16:58.550
IMPORTS.

16:58.617 --> 16:59.685
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.687
ONE TIME IN 2006, A MEMBER

17:01.754 --> 17:02.821
SNATCHED A WRITTEN PROPOSAL OF A

17:02.888 --> 17:03.589
BILL AND SHOVED IT INTO HER OWN

17:03.655 --> 17:04.623
MOUTH.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.024
WHICH IS FANTASTIC, AND

17:06.091 --> 17:08.427
DEFINITELY SOMETHING WE SHOULD

17:08.494 --> 17:09.094
STEAL.

17:09.161 --> 17:09.728
YOU WANT TO KILL A CLEAN ENERGY

17:09.795 --> 17:10.596
BILL?

17:10.662 --> 17:13.165
PULL UP A CHAIR AND FUCKING EAT

17:13.232 --> 17:15.134
ALL 900 PAGES OF IT.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.535
BUT TAIWAN ISN'T JUST A

17:16.602 --> 17:19.505
FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY.

17:19.571 --> 17:20.305
IT'S A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE

17:20.372 --> 17:21.240
GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN.

17:21.306 --> 17:22.641
TAIWAN WAS THE FASTEST GROWING

17:22.708 --> 17:23.375
ECONOMY IN ASIA LAST YEAR, AND

17:23.442 --> 17:24.410
IT'S THE WORLD'S KEY

17:24.476 --> 17:26.345
MANUFACTURER OF SEMICONDUCTORS,

17:26.412 --> 17:27.980
WHICH ARE USED EVERYWHERE IN

17:28.046 --> 17:31.350
PRODUCTS FROM CARS TO SEX TOYS.

17:31.417 --> 17:32.951
SO THE NEXT TIME YOU FIRE UP A

17:33.018 --> 17:34.386
BUTT PLUG THAT HAS 100,000 TIMES

17:34.453 --> 17:35.654
MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN THE

17:35.721 --> 17:37.322
"APOLLO" MOON MISSION, MAKE SURE

17:37.389 --> 17:40.559
YOU SAY, "THANKS, TAIWAN."

17:40.626 --> 17:42.461
SO ALL OF THIS BRINGS US TO

17:42.528 --> 17:43.996
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW, WITH

17:44.062 --> 17:45.464
TAIWAN ESTABLISHED AS A

17:45.531 --> 17:46.031
HIGHLY-DEVELOPED AND WEALTHY

17:46.098 --> 17:47.266
COUNTRY.

17:47.332 --> 17:49.201
AND YET, NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO

17:49.268 --> 17:50.569
CALL IT ONE.

17:50.636 --> 17:52.538
AND THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THE

17:52.604 --> 17:53.272
HUGE, UNRESOLVED ISSUE OF

17:53.338 --> 17:56.475
TAIWANESE SOVEREIGNTY.

17:56.542 --> 17:57.409
BECAUSE CHINA NOW SEES CLAIMING

17:57.476 --> 17:58.444
TAIWAN AS A KEY POINT OF

17:58.510 --> 18:00.379
NATIONAL PRIDE, WITH XI JINPING

18:00.446 --> 18:01.647
CALLING REUNIFICATION PART OF

18:01.713 --> 18:02.815
HIS VISION FOR "THE GREAT

18:02.881 --> 18:05.984
REJUVENATION OF THE CHINESE

18:06.051 --> 18:06.218
NATION."

18:06.285 --> 18:06.952
AND ANYONE WANTING TO DO

18:07.019 --> 18:08.554
BUSINESS IN CHINA KNOWS THAT

18:08.620 --> 18:09.855
CALLING TAIWAN A COUNTRY IS A

18:09.922 --> 18:11.790
MASSIVE FAUX PAS.

18:11.857 --> 18:13.725
AND IT'S NOT JUST THE GAP AND

18:13.792 --> 18:16.295
JOHN CENA WHO'VE FOUND THAT OUT.

18:16.361 --> 18:17.496
ALL OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE

18:17.563 --> 18:18.363
EITHER HAD TO APOLOGIZE FOR, OR

18:18.430 --> 18:19.965
WALK BACK, EVEN THE SMALLEST

18:20.032 --> 18:21.500
IMPLICATION THAT TAIWAN IS A

18:21.567 --> 18:23.936
SEPARATE COUNTRY.

18:24.002 --> 18:24.503
AND YOU CAN SEE THIS CAUTION

18:24.570 --> 18:26.305
EVERYWHERE.

18:26.371 --> 18:27.339
AT THIS YEAR'S OLYMPICS, YOU

18:27.406 --> 18:29.174
PROBABLY SAW TAIWANESE ATHLETES

18:29.241 --> 18:30.175
COMPETING NOT UNDER THE

18:30.242 --> 18:31.643
TAIWANESE FLAG, BUT UNDER THE

18:31.710 --> 18:33.178
FAKE PSEUDO-FLAG OF "CHINESE

18:33.245 --> 18:34.313
TAIPEI," SOMETHING THEY'VE BEEN

18:34.379 --> 18:36.582
FORCED TO USE AT EVERY OLYMPICS

18:36.648 --> 18:38.083
SINCE THE 1980s WHEN THEY

18:38.150 --> 18:39.017
REACHED A COMPROMISE WITH THE

18:39.084 --> 18:40.419
IOC THAT ALLOWED THEM TO

18:40.486 --> 18:41.820
PARTICIPATE WITHOUT ANGERING

18:41.887 --> 18:43.155
CHINA.

18:43.222 --> 18:44.289
BUT THIS ARRANGEMENT ISN'T

18:44.356 --> 18:45.057
SOMETHING THAT ALL TAIWANESE

18:45.123 --> 18:46.291
PEOPLE APPRECIATE.

18:46.358 --> 18:49.027
IN FACT, DURING THE 2012 GAMES,

18:49.094 --> 18:49.761
THE LEAD SINGER OF TAIWANESE

18:49.828 --> 18:52.030
HEAVY-METAL BAND CHTHONIC

18:52.097 --> 18:55.167
POINTED OUT HOW LUDICROUS IT IS.

18:55.234 --> 18:56.568
>> OUR TEAM, OUR NATIONAL TEAM'S

18:56.635 --> 18:57.703
BEEN CALLED CHINESE FUCKING

18:57.769 --> 19:01.273
TAIPEI.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.574
FUCKING BULLSHIT, RIGHT?

19:02.641 --> 19:03.175
"OH, WE CAN'T CALL YOU TAIWAN,

19:03.242 --> 19:04.443
SORRY.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.178
WE HAVE TO CALL YOU CHINESE

19:06.245 --> 19:09.248
FUCKING TAIPEI."

19:09.314 --> 19:11.049
>> John: I KNOW I SAY THIS EVERY

19:11.116 --> 19:11.750
WEEK, BUT THAT DEATH METAL

19:11.817 --> 19:12.851
SINGER COMPLAINING ABOUT OLYMPIC

19:12.918 --> 19:16.822
NOMENCLATURE HAS A POINT.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.423
ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, IF THEIR

19:18.490 --> 19:20.125
OFFICIAL OLYMPICS NAME REALLY

19:20.192 --> 19:22.194
WAS "CHINESE FUCKING TAIPEI,"

19:22.261 --> 19:23.328
THAT WOULD AT LEAST BE A LITTLE

19:23.395 --> 19:24.229
MORE ACCURATE VIS-A-VIS WHO'S

19:24.296 --> 19:26.798
FUCKING WHOM.

19:26.865 --> 19:28.367
AND EVEN HUGE INTERNATIONAL

19:28.433 --> 19:29.635
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE W.H.O.

19:29.701 --> 19:31.236
ARE FORCED TO PLAY THIS

19:31.303 --> 19:32.371
RIDICULOUS GAME, FREEZING OUT

19:32.437 --> 19:35.173
TAIWAN FROM FULL PARTICIPATION.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.676
LAST YEAR, WHEN ONE W.H.O

19:37.743 --> 19:38.610
OFFICIAL WAS PRESSED ON THIS

19:38.677 --> 19:40.779
POINT BY A HONG KONG NEWSCASTER,

19:40.846 --> 19:41.713
IT LED TO THIS VERY AWKWARD

19:41.780 --> 19:43.882
INTERACTION.

19:43.949 --> 19:45.884
>> WILL W.H.O. CONSIDER TAIWAN'S

19:45.951 --> 19:56.628
MEMBERSHIP?

19:56.695 --> 19:56.895
[LAUGHTER]

19:56.962 --> 19:58.297
HELLO?

19:58.363 --> 19:58.931
>> I'M SORRY.

19:58.997 --> 19:59.932
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

19:59.998 --> 20:00.532
I COULDN'T HEAR YOUR QUESTION.

20:00.599 --> 20:00.866
>> OKAY, YEAH.

20:00.933 --> 20:01.433
LET ME -- LET ME REPEAT THE

20:01.500 --> 20:02.067
QUESTION.

20:02.134 --> 20:02.768
>> NO, THAT'S OKAY.

20:02.834 --> 20:06.805
LET'S MOVE TO ANOTHER ONE THEN.

20:06.872 --> 20:07.539
>> I'M ACTUALLY CURIOUS ON

20:07.606 --> 20:08.507
TALKING ABOUT TAIWAN AS WELL ON

20:08.574 --> 20:16.848
TAIWAN'S CASE.

20:16.915 --> 20:17.382
[LAUGHTER]

20:17.449 --> 20:18.483
>> WE DECIDED TO GIVE DR.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.151
AYLWARD ANOTHER CALL TO FOLLOW

20:19.217 --> 20:20.452
UP.

20:20.519 --> 20:21.687
>> AND I JUST WANT TO SEE IF YOU

20:21.753 --> 20:23.355
CAN COMMENT A BIT ON HOW TAIWAN

20:23.422 --> 20:24.523
HAS DONE SO FAR IN TERMS OF

20:24.590 --> 20:27.693
CONTAINING THE VIRUS.

20:27.759 --> 20:28.393
>> WELL, WE'VE ALREADY TALKED

20:28.460 --> 20:30.529
ABOUT CHINA.

20:30.596 --> 20:37.035
>> John: OH, WE DID, DID WE?

20:37.102 --> 20:37.636
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

20:37.703 --> 20:38.370
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE FIRST, YOU

20:38.437 --> 20:38.937
PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR THE

20:39.004 --> 20:39.805
QUESTION, THEN FAKED GETTING

20:39.871 --> 20:40.672
DISCONNECTED AFTER COMMITTING

20:40.739 --> 20:41.440
THE WORLD'S MOST TELEGRAPHED

20:41.506 --> 20:43.775
LOGOFF.

20:43.842 --> 20:44.910
THAT MAN COULDN'T BE MORE

20:44.977 --> 20:46.144
CLEARLY AVOIDING THE QUESTION IF

20:46.211 --> 20:47.446
HE CAME BACK ONLINE PRETENDING

20:47.512 --> 20:48.847
TO BE A LAMP.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.216
"YOU CAN'T ASK A LAMP ABOUT

20:51.283 --> 20:52.918
TAIWAN.

20:52.985 --> 20:53.518
ESPECIALLY ME -- I ONLY SPEAK

20:53.585 --> 20:53.885
FRENCH.

20:53.952 --> 20:54.386
SO THAT'S TWO REASONS I

20:54.453 --> 20:54.987
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO ANSWER THIS

20:55.053 --> 20:55.721
QUESTION.

20:55.787 --> 20:56.688
I'M A LAMP, AND I ONLY SPEAK

20:56.755 --> 20:58.156
FRENCH, EXCEPT FOR THIS BRIEF

20:58.223 --> 20:59.625
PARAGRAPH IN ENGLISH EXPLAINING

20:59.691 --> 21:01.059
MY SITUATION.

21:01.126 --> 21:02.427
AU REVOIR!

21:02.494 --> 21:06.064
JE SUIS LAMP."

21:06.131 --> 21:07.232
BUT IT'S NOT JUST COMPANIES AND

21:07.299 --> 21:08.800
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.

21:08.867 --> 21:10.235
THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORLD

21:10.302 --> 21:11.536
GOVERNMENTS HAVE NO OFFICIAL

21:11.603 --> 21:13.372
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN

21:13.438 --> 21:15.240
BECAUSE CHINA WON'T HAVE

21:15.307 --> 21:16.375
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH ANYONE

21:16.441 --> 21:17.776
WHO DOES.

21:17.843 --> 21:19.645
AND FOR ALL THE INITIAL

21:19.711 --> 21:20.779
CHEERLEADING FROM WESTERN

21:20.846 --> 21:21.413
COUNTRIES ABOUT "TAIWAN'S PLUCK

21:21.480 --> 21:24.016
AND VERVE IN KEEPING THE

21:24.082 --> 21:27.452
ANTI-COMMUNIST FLAG FLYING?"

21:27.519 --> 21:28.787
THINGS HAVE SHIFTED.

21:28.854 --> 21:30.155
BY THE END OF THE 1970s, MOST

21:30.222 --> 21:31.256
COUNTRIES HAD SWITCHED THEIR

21:31.323 --> 21:32.824
RECOGNITION OF CHINA'S OFFICIAL

21:32.891 --> 21:34.026
GOVERNMENT FROM THE ONE ON

21:34.092 --> 21:35.227
TAIWAN, KNOWN AS THE REPUBLIC OF

21:35.293 --> 21:37.429
CHINA, TO THE COMMUNIST ONE ON

21:37.496 --> 21:39.331
THE MAINLAND, THE PEOPLE'S

21:39.398 --> 21:40.399
REPUBLIC OF CHINA.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.034
IN FACT, TODAY, THE NUMBER OF

21:42.100 --> 21:43.802
GOVERNMENTS STILL WILLING TO

21:43.869 --> 21:45.804
DIPLOMATICALLY RECOGNIZE TAIWAN

21:45.871 --> 21:47.539
HAS DWINDLED TO ONLY 14

21:47.606 --> 21:49.374
COUNTRIES AND THE HOLY SEE.

21:49.441 --> 21:50.308
ALTHOUGH THAT LAST ONE SHOULDN'T

21:50.375 --> 21:51.743
BE SURPRISING.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.145
YOU KNOW THE POPE.

21:53.211 --> 21:56.214
HE LOVES TO STIR SHIT UP.

21:56.281 --> 21:57.282
DRINKS WINE IN THE MORNING.

21:57.349 --> 21:58.383
HE'S A MESSY BITCH WHO LIVES FOR

21:58.450 --> 22:00.752
DRAMA.

22:00.819 --> 22:01.853
AS FOR AMERICA, WE'VE SPENT THE

22:01.920 --> 22:04.222
PAST HALF CENTURY WALKING A

22:04.289 --> 22:05.457
DIPLOMATIC TIGHTROPE WITH A

22:05.524 --> 22:07.192
POLICY KNOWN AS "STRATEGIC

22:07.259 --> 22:08.493
AMBIGUITY."

22:08.560 --> 22:11.263
IT'S SOMETHING THAT LETS US

22:11.329 --> 22:12.230
MAINTAIN FUNCTIONAL RELATIONS

22:12.297 --> 22:14.366
WITH TAIWAN AND STILL HAVE A

22:14.433 --> 22:15.067
FULL FORMAL RELATIONSHIP WITH

22:15.133 --> 22:19.271
CHINA.

22:19.337 --> 22:19.871
IT'S AN APPROACH THAT BEGAN IN

22:19.938 --> 22:20.505
THE 1970s AND WAS BUILT UPON A

22:20.572 --> 22:21.106
SERIES OF INCREDIBLY CAREFULLY

22:21.173 --> 22:22.808
WORDED STATEMENTS.

22:22.874 --> 22:34.686
>> THE UNITED STATES

22:34.753 --> 22:35.320
>> THE UNITED STATES IN ONE OF

22:35.387 --> 22:35.854
OUR COMMUNIQUES WITH THE

22:35.921 --> 22:36.388
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

22:36.455 --> 22:36.988
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT TAIWAN IS A

22:37.055 --> 22:38.757
PART OF CHINA.

22:38.824 --> 22:39.391
BUT THE UNITED STATES ALSO DID

22:39.458 --> 22:39.958
NOT ACCEPT THE PRC CLAIM TO

22:40.025 --> 22:40.192
TAIWAN.

22:40.258 --> 22:40.826
THAT HAS BEEN OUR POSITION EVER

22:40.892 --> 22:41.426
SINCE.

22:41.493 --> 22:42.928
AND SO, IN EFFECT, THE U.S.

22:42.994 --> 22:44.963
VIEWS TAIWAN'S STATUS AS

22:45.030 --> 22:49.201
UNDETERMINED.

22:49.267 --> 22:49.801
>> John: RIGHT.

22:49.868 --> 22:50.569
WE ACKNOWLEDGED CHINA'S CLAIM,

22:50.635 --> 22:52.170
BUT DIDN'T AGREE WITH IT,

22:52.237 --> 22:53.238
LEAVING TAIWAN'S STATUS AS

22:53.305 --> 22:55.741
"UNDETERMINED."

22:55.807 --> 22:56.541
YOU KNOW, LIKE SHRODINGER'S CAT,

22:56.608 --> 22:58.009
OR THE SCIENTOLOGY VERSION,

22:58.076 --> 22:59.010
MISCAVIGE'S WIFE.

22:59.077 --> 23:00.178
THEY COULD BE ONE THING OR THE

23:00.245 --> 23:01.313
OTHER THING, AND NO ONE KNOWS

23:01.379 --> 23:02.280
FOR SURE, DO THEY, DAVID?

23:02.347 --> 23:04.683
HEY DAVID, DAVID, WHERE'S

23:04.750 --> 23:06.518
SHELLY?

23:06.585 --> 23:08.553
BUT THAT CONFUSION IS EMBLEMATIC

23:08.620 --> 23:10.055
OF THE "STRATEGIC AMBIGUITY"

23:10.122 --> 23:11.456
POLICY.

23:11.523 --> 23:13.525
FOR INSTANCE, THE U.S. OPERATES

23:13.592 --> 23:14.359
OUT OF THIS BUILDING IN TAIWAN,

23:14.426 --> 23:15.994
OFTEN REFERRED TO AS ITS "DE

23:16.061 --> 23:17.129
FACTO EMBASSY," BUT NOT,

23:17.195 --> 23:19.364
CRUCIALLY, AN ACTUAL EMBASSY.

23:19.431 --> 23:21.767
MEANWHILE, TAIWAN HAS THIS

23:21.833 --> 23:22.768
BUILDING IN D.C., WHICH DOES

23:22.834 --> 23:24.402
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THAT AN

23:24.469 --> 23:25.771
EMBASSY WOULD DO, JUST WITHOUT

23:25.837 --> 23:27.672
ACTUALLY BEING CALLED ONE.

23:27.739 --> 23:29.274
AND I KNOW THIS POLICY CAN

23:29.341 --> 23:31.009
OCCASIONALLY SEEM RIDICULOUS,

23:31.076 --> 23:32.577
BUT THE UNCERTAINTY IS KIND OF

23:32.644 --> 23:34.346
THE POINT, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT

23:34.412 --> 23:36.248
COMES TO DEFENSE.

23:36.314 --> 23:38.016
IN 1979, CONGRESS PASSED THE

23:38.083 --> 23:39.785
TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT, IN WHICH

23:39.851 --> 23:41.052
THE U.S. COMMITTED TO ASSIST

23:41.119 --> 23:42.187
TAIWAN IN MAINTAINING ITS

23:42.254 --> 23:44.222
SELF-DEFENSE CAPABILITY.

23:44.289 --> 23:46.658
BUT THAT COMMITMENT VERY MUCH

23:46.725 --> 23:47.993
STOPS SHORT OF THE U.S.

23:48.059 --> 23:49.060
PROMISING TO DEFEND TAIWAN FROM

23:49.127 --> 23:50.395
A CHINESE INVASION.

23:50.462 --> 23:55.100
INSTEAD, IT SAYS MILITARY

23:55.167 --> 23:59.204
AND THE EFFORT TO DETERMINE THE

23:59.271 --> 24:00.672
FUTURE OF TAIWAN WOULD BE OF

24:00.739 --> 24:01.940
GRAVE CONCERN TO THE

24:02.007 --> 24:02.274
UNITED STATES.

24:02.340 --> 24:05.844
AND WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

24:05.911 --> 24:06.912
DOES IT MEAN THE U.S. WOULD

24:06.978 --> 24:08.814
DEPLOY MILITARY ASSETS?

24:08.880 --> 24:09.614
OR JUST THAT A U.S. GENERAL

24:09.681 --> 24:10.215
WOULD RAISE AN EYEBROW?

24:10.282 --> 24:11.016
NO ONE KNOWS.

24:11.082 --> 24:15.720
IT'S A WILLFULLY CONFUSING

24:15.787 --> 24:16.321
WILL-THEY OR WON'T-THEY DANCE,

24:16.388 --> 24:17.088
THAT FOR 40 YEARS HAS BEEN THE

24:17.155 --> 24:17.722
BACKBONE OF U.S.-TAIWAN POLICY.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.224
AND LOOK, SO FAR, WE'VE BEEN

24:19.291 --> 24:20.125
TALKING ABOUT TAIWAN ALMOST

24:20.192 --> 24:20.992
EXCLUSIVELY IN TERMS OF WHAT

24:21.059 --> 24:22.594
OTHER COUNTRIES WANT FROM IT.

24:22.661 --> 24:24.129
BUT THE KEY QUESTION IS CLEARLY,

24:24.196 --> 24:26.364
WHAT DOES IT WANT FOR ITSELF?

24:26.431 --> 24:27.666
BUT EVEN THAT'S NOT EASY TO

24:27.732 --> 24:30.635
ANSWER.

24:30.702 --> 24:32.103
TAIWAN IS MADE UP OF A MIX OF

24:32.170 --> 24:32.704
DIFFERENT CULTURES, LANGUAGES

24:32.771 --> 24:33.338
AND POLITICAL VIEWPOINTS.

24:33.405 --> 24:34.739
REMEMBER, THEIR LAWMAKERS

24:34.806 --> 24:35.607
SOMETIMES THROW PIG INTESTINES

24:35.674 --> 24:37.542
AT EACH OTHER IN PARLIAMENT.

24:37.609 --> 24:38.577
EVERYONE IS NOT ON THE SAME PAGE

24:38.643 --> 24:41.580
THERE.

24:41.646 --> 24:43.415
BUT TO THE EXTENT TAIWANESE

24:43.481 --> 24:44.015
PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN THROUGH THE

24:44.082 --> 24:45.550
BALLOT BOX, THEY'VE CHOSEN A

24:45.617 --> 24:46.318
GOVERNMENT THAT WANTS TO KEEP

24:46.384 --> 24:47.319
CHINA AT ARM'S LENGTH.

24:47.385 --> 24:48.119
THAT SINGER YOU SAW EARLIER

24:48.186 --> 24:49.888
TALKING ABOUT "CHINESE FUCKING

24:49.955 --> 24:50.722
TAIPEI?"

24:50.789 --> 24:52.724
HE'S ACTUALLY IN TAIWAN'S

24:52.791 --> 24:54.259
PARLIAMENT NOW, AND HE'S OPENLY

24:54.326 --> 24:56.461
PRO-INDEPENDENCE.

24:56.528 --> 24:57.629
AS FOR TAIWAN'S CURRENT LEADER,

24:57.696 --> 24:59.798
TSAI ING-WEN, SHE WAS ELECTED ON

24:59.865 --> 25:02.868
A PLATFORM OF DEFENDING TAIWAN,

25:02.934 --> 25:04.870
BUT, CRUCIALLY, PRESERVING THE

25:04.936 --> 25:05.937
STATUS QUO.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.539
JUST WATCH HOW CAUTIOUSLY SHE

25:07.606 --> 25:08.640
DISCUSSES THE QUESTION OF

25:08.707 --> 25:11.309
TAIWANESE INDEPENDENCE.

25:11.376 --> 25:13.345
>> ARE YOU IN PRINCIPLE AT LEAST

25:13.411 --> 25:16.014
IN FAVOR OF THE IDEA OF FORMAL

25:16.081 --> 25:18.783
TAIWANESE INDEPENDENCE?

25:18.850 --> 25:20.252
>> THE REALITY, AND WHAT IT IS

25:20.318 --> 25:21.887
NOW, IS THAT WE ARE ALREADY A

25:21.953 --> 25:24.289
FUNCTIONALLY INDEPENDENT

25:24.356 --> 25:26.591
COUNTRY.

25:26.658 --> 25:27.893
WE HAVE OUR OWN GOVERNMENT, AND

25:27.959 --> 25:29.995
WE HAVE OUR OWN ELECTION.

25:30.061 --> 25:31.463
>> WILL THERE COME A DAY WHEN

25:31.529 --> 25:32.797
THAT REALITY NEEDS TO BE SPELLED

25:32.864 --> 25:33.632
OUT BY A FORMAL DECLARATION OF

25:33.698 --> 25:35.667
INDEPENDENCE?

25:35.734 --> 25:37.002
>> THE IDEA IS THAT WE DON'T

25:37.068 --> 25:38.737
HAVE A NEED TO DECLARE OURSELVES

25:38.803 --> 25:39.671
AN INDEPENDENT STATE, BUT WE ARE

25:39.738 --> 25:41.439
AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY.

25:41.506 --> 25:43.241
>> John: RIGHT.

25:43.308 --> 25:44.743
SHE'S CLEARLY DECLARING THAT

25:44.809 --> 25:45.744
THEY'RE INDEPENDENT THERE, BUT

25:45.810 --> 25:47.345
IS ALSO VERY MUCH DRAWING THE

25:47.412 --> 25:48.413
LINE AT A DECLARATION OF

25:48.480 --> 25:49.981
INDEPENDENCE.

25:50.048 --> 25:50.882
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT TAIWAN

25:50.949 --> 25:51.883
EXPLICITLY FORMALIZING THE WAY

25:51.950 --> 25:53.385
THINGS ARE COULD CAUSE A LOT OF

25:53.451 --> 25:55.287
TROUBLE.

25:55.353 --> 25:56.688
IT'S LIKE MEETING YOUR PARTNER'S

25:56.755 --> 25:57.822
PARENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND

25:57.889 --> 25:59.224
SAYING, "HELLO, I REGULARLY FUCK

25:59.291 --> 26:00.592
YOUR OFFSPRING."

26:00.659 --> 26:01.593
YEAH.

26:01.660 --> 26:03.528
EVERYONE WAS AWARE OF THAT.

26:03.595 --> 26:04.629
BUT NOW THAT YOU'VE OFFICIALLY

26:04.696 --> 26:06.197
DECLARED IT, THINGS ARE GOING TO

26:06.264 --> 26:08.033
GET MORE DIFFICULT FOR EVERYONE

26:08.099 --> 26:10.669
INVOLVED.

26:10.735 --> 26:12.470
AND THE TRUTH IS, THAT INTENSE

26:12.537 --> 26:13.838
PRAGMATISM IS IN LINE WITH HOW

26:13.905 --> 26:15.840
MANY TAIWANESE PEOPLE FEEL.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.242
POLLS HAVE CONSISTENTLY SHOWN

26:17.309 --> 26:19.110
THAT WHEN THEY'RE ASKED ABOUT

26:19.177 --> 26:20.612
INDEPENDENCE FROM OR UNIFICATION

26:20.679 --> 26:23.348
WITH CHINA, SOMETHING LIKE 1.5

26:23.415 --> 26:24.416
PERCENT WANT UNIFICATION WITH

26:24.482 --> 26:25.684
CHINA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND

26:25.750 --> 26:27.352
ABOUT SIX PERCENT WANT

26:27.419 --> 26:28.286
INDEPENDENCE AS SOON AS

26:28.353 --> 26:32.357
POSSIBLE, BUT THE VAST MAJORITY

26:32.424 --> 26:33.158
FAVOR SOME VERSION OF STICKING

26:33.224 --> 26:34.025
WITH THE STATUS QUO, AT LEAST

26:34.092 --> 26:34.859
FOR NOW.

26:34.926 --> 26:36.528
WHICH MAKES SENSE.

26:36.594 --> 26:38.129
BECAUSE AS THINGS STAND, AS

26:38.196 --> 26:40.365
VOLATILE AS THIS SITUATION CAN

26:40.432 --> 26:41.633
APPEAR, DAY-TO-DAY LIFE IN

26:41.700 --> 26:43.935
TAIWAN CAN GO ON AS NORMAL.

26:44.002 --> 27:10.028
AS THIS TAIWANESE MAN SHOWS.

27:10.095 --> 27:11.629
>> John: WOW.

27:11.696 --> 27:12.864
THAT IS A PRETTY RELAXED

27:12.931 --> 27:13.631
ATTITUDE GIVEN THE

27:13.698 --> 27:15.467
CIRCUMSTANCES.

27:15.533 --> 27:16.868
HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE

27:16.935 --> 27:18.069
NUCLEAR-ARMED, SABER-RATTLING

27:18.136 --> 27:18.703
SUPERPOWER TAUNTING HIS COUNTRY

27:18.770 --> 27:20.772
WITH WARPLANES LIKE IT'S SEASON

27:20.839 --> 27:23.375
TWO OF "EMILY IN PARIS."

27:23.441 --> 27:24.909
"YOU KNOW, I DON'T LOVE THAT

27:24.976 --> 27:26.077
IT'S HAPPENING, BUT I JUST TRY

27:26.144 --> 27:32.817
TO CARRY ON WITH MY LIFE."

27:32.884 --> 27:33.518
BUT THE KEY QUESTION IS, CAN THE

27:33.585 --> 27:34.152
CURRENTLY-SAFE STATUS QUO HOLD

27:34.219 --> 27:34.886
FOREVER?

27:34.953 --> 27:36.621
XI JINPING HAS STATED THAT THE

27:36.688 --> 27:38.556
QUESTION OF TAIWAN CANNOT SIMPLY

27:38.623 --> 27:39.324
BE "PASSED ON FROM GENERATION TO

27:39.391 --> 27:40.925
GENERATION."

27:40.992 --> 27:42.160
AND THOSE MILITARY DRILLS SEEM

27:42.227 --> 27:44.029
TO BE SENDING A MESSAGE.

27:44.095 --> 27:45.797
AND WHILE EXPERTS SAY WAR ISN'T

27:45.864 --> 27:48.033
IMMINENT, TAIWAN IS

27:48.099 --> 27:48.733
UNDERSTANDABLY THINKING ABOUT

27:48.800 --> 27:50.201
ITS OWN DEFENSE CAPABILITIES.

27:50.268 --> 27:52.470
SOMETHING, BY THE WAY, WE'VE

27:52.537 --> 27:53.905
BEEN HAPPY TO ASSIST THEM IN

27:53.972 --> 27:56.274
THINKING ABOUT, BY SELLING THEM

27:56.341 --> 27:57.208
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN WEAPONS,

27:57.275 --> 27:59.878
SHOWING EVEN "STRATEGIC

27:59.944 --> 28:01.079
AMBIGUITY" HAS ITS PRICE.

28:01.146 --> 28:03.748
BUT DESPITE U.S. ASSISTANCE, THE

28:03.815 --> 28:04.816
TAIWAN MILITARY IS OBVIOUSLY A

28:04.883 --> 28:06.051
FRACTION OF CHINA'S.

28:06.117 --> 28:07.085
AND ITS RECENT ATTEMPTS TO

28:07.152 --> 28:07.886
ATTRACT RECRUITS HAVE LEFT

28:07.952 --> 28:11.389
SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED.

28:11.456 --> 28:12.824
>> THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN

28:12.891 --> 28:14.492
PRODUCING VIDEOS LIKE THIS TO

28:14.559 --> 28:16.294
TRY TO DRUM UP ENTHUSIASM AMONG

28:16.361 --> 28:17.996
POTENTIAL YOUNG SOLDIERS.

28:18.063 --> 28:19.064
BUT THEY'VE BEEN STRUGGLING TO

28:19.130 --> 28:20.799
MAKE UP FOR A SHORTFALL LEFT BY

28:20.865 --> 28:23.435
A PHASING OUT OF CONSCRIPTION.

28:23.501 --> 28:24.803
>> John: OKAY, I'M NOT SURE

28:24.869 --> 28:26.638
THAT'S HELPING.

28:26.704 --> 28:27.772
THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A GROUP

28:27.839 --> 28:28.606
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE EXCITED TO BE

28:28.673 --> 28:30.108
IN THE MILITARY.

28:30.175 --> 28:30.775
IT LOOKS LIKE A BUNCH OF

28:30.842 --> 28:32.110
BACKGROUND DANCERS WHO WERE CUT

28:32.177 --> 28:33.611
FROM "IN THE HEIGHTS" BECAUSE

28:33.678 --> 28:34.679
THEY WERE TOO BORING TO BE ON

28:34.746 --> 28:38.650
CAMERA.

28:38.716 --> 28:39.317
SO WHAT EXACTLY CAN OR SHOULD BE

28:39.384 --> 28:40.351
DONE HERE?

28:40.418 --> 28:41.152
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING THE

28:41.219 --> 28:43.121
ENTIRE WORLD HAS BEEN DISSECTING

28:43.188 --> 28:44.355
FOR HALF A CENTURY NOW, AND SO

28:44.422 --> 28:45.657
FAR THE ANSWER WE SEEM TO HAVE

28:45.723 --> 28:46.291
SETTLED ON IS SOME VERSION OF,

28:46.357 --> 28:47.959
"UH...

28:48.026 --> 28:50.095
NEXT QUESTION, PLEASE," WHICH IS

28:50.161 --> 28:52.697
CLEARLY NOT VERY SATISFYING.

28:52.764 --> 28:53.798
AND I KNOW AMBIGUITY IS

28:53.865 --> 28:55.967
INHERENTLY FRUSTRATING,

28:56.034 --> 28:57.168
ESPECIALLY FOR AMERICANS, WHO

28:57.235 --> 28:58.269
MIGHT LOOK AT A PLACE LIKE

28:58.336 --> 28:59.871
TAIWAN, WHICH LOOKS AND ACTS

28:59.938 --> 29:01.606
LIKE A COUNTRY, AND FEEL IT'S

29:01.673 --> 29:03.341
WEIRD AND FARCICAL TO NOT

29:03.408 --> 29:04.809
ACKNOWLEDGE IT AS ONE.

29:04.876 --> 29:05.844
BUT FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT,

29:05.910 --> 29:07.645
WOULD THAT BE BETTER?

29:07.712 --> 29:09.314
AND IS THAT EVEN WHAT THE PEOPLE

29:09.380 --> 29:11.483
OF TAIWAN WANT?

29:11.549 --> 29:12.750
COULD IT BE THAT MAINTAINING THE

29:12.817 --> 29:13.985
CURRENT, DEEPLY WEIRD, AMBIGUOUS

29:14.052 --> 29:16.387
STATUS QUO IS ACTUALLY THE BEST

29:16.454 --> 29:17.856
OPTION?

29:17.922 --> 29:19.090
I DON'T KNOW.

29:19.157 --> 29:22.760
I'M NOT TAIWANESE, AND FRANKLY,

29:22.827 --> 29:24.028
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T TAIWANESE

29:24.095 --> 29:26.798
MAKING DECISIONS FOR TAIWAN IS A

29:26.865 --> 29:27.665
BIT FUCKING PLAYED OUT,

29:27.732 --> 29:28.466
HISTORICALLY.

29:28.533 --> 29:29.267
SO MAYBE THE BEST THING WE CAN

29:29.334 --> 29:31.169
DO IS MOVE PAST TALKING ABOUT

29:31.236 --> 29:31.803
TAIWAN LIKE IT'S SOME KIND OF

29:31.870 --> 29:33.738
POKER CHIP IN A NEVER-ENDING

29:33.805 --> 29:35.140
GAME OF US VS. THEM.

29:35.206 --> 29:37.308
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, TAIWAN IS

29:37.375 --> 29:38.510
NOT A PLUCKY BULWARK AGAINST THE

29:38.576 --> 29:40.912
RED MENACE, NOR IS IT SOME SORT

29:40.979 --> 29:42.213
OF ISLAND-SIZED VIAGRA TO

29:42.280 --> 29:46.518
REJUVENATE THE CHINESE NATION.

29:46.584 --> 29:47.919
TAIWAN IS 23 MILLION PEOPLE,

29:47.986 --> 29:49.787
WHO, IN THE FACE OF CONSIDERABLE

29:49.854 --> 29:51.456
ODDS, HAVE BUILT A FREE,

29:51.523 --> 29:53.057
DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, AND VERY

29:53.124 --> 29:54.125
MUCH DESERVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE

29:54.192 --> 29:55.727
THEIR OWN FUTURE, IN ANY WAY

29:55.793 --> 29:58.830
THEY DEEM FIT, EVEN IF THAT

29:58.897 --> 30:02.500
MEANS SPORADICALLY BEATING THE

30:02.567 --> 30:03.201
ABSOLUTE SHIT OUT OF EACH OTHER.

30:03.268 --> 30:08.773
AND NOW THIS.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.976
>> AND NOW, JAMES CORDEN
