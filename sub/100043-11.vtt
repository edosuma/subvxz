00:01.585 --> 00:03.754
Question, I need to hire an assistant.

00:03.754 --> 00:04.963
Do you think it would be unethical

00:05.047 --> 00:06.673
to hire the second most
qualified candidate?

00:06.798 --> 00:09.134
- What's wrong with the most qualified?
- Well...

00:09.218 --> 00:11.303
And after graduating Stanford engineering,

00:11.303 --> 00:13.096
I was offered a Rhodes scholarship.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.432
Do you have any questions for me?

00:16.975 --> 00:19.019
I definitely have to carve out
some extra time for giggling.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.729
You can't discriminate
against the poor guy

00:20.729 --> 00:21.855
just because he's a smoke-show.

00:21.939 --> 00:24.441
I've been battling hot-shaming
my entire life.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.651
Please don't say "Hot Lives Matter."

00:26.944 --> 00:28.195
Hey, Grandpa, what's up?

00:28.195 --> 00:29.821
Returning this to your mom.

00:30.322 --> 00:31.323
Who's the beefcake?

00:32.824 --> 00:35.702
I need to hire an assistant, and this
gentleman is currently the frontrunner.

00:35.827 --> 00:36.954
Does he get a normal paycheck

00:36.954 --> 00:39.206
or are you just gonna stuff ones
down his G-string?

00:39.206 --> 00:41.250
I do have some trepidation
about the optics.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.502
Well, you should.
These are sensitive times.

00:43.502 --> 00:44.837
Perception is everything.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.297
I didn't care about any of that crap.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.716
I don't have enough work
for my assistant Margaret.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.093
Been with me 40 years.

00:51.426 --> 00:54.388
I can't just put her out to pasture
like some worn-out plow horse.

00:54.805 --> 00:56.640
The old broad deserves a little respect.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.394
No offense, Grandpa, but I need someone
who can hit the ground running.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.272
Margaret's more someone who would hit
a pedestrian and not even realize it.

01:03.272 --> 01:05.023
Just because she's no Christie Brinkley,

01:05.107 --> 01:06.775
who by the way is a year older
than Margaret,

01:06.859 --> 01:08.485
doesn't mean we throw her
on the scrap heap.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.279
Well, she'd have to start tomorrow.

01:10.279 --> 01:11.822
Is she okay working on a Saturday?

01:11.822 --> 01:14.366
That's the advantage of hiring somebody
with a few miles on her.

01:14.366 --> 01:17.661
By 6:00 a.m., she will have had two
soft-boiled eggs and be raring to go.

01:31.633 --> 01:32.885
Cam, come on, let's go.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.220
No, hold on just a second.
I need to finish this.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.931
Please tell me this isn't another
letter-writing campaign.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.391
They're not gonna rename our street.

01:39.391 --> 01:42.811
Mary Kay Place would be a very fun tribute
to an American treasure,

01:42.895 --> 01:44.938
- but no, that's not what this is.
- Cam, come on.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.357
I want to go. The store opens
in a half hour, okay?

01:47.441 --> 01:49.443
You know I get all my pants
for the entire year at this sale.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.570
And 32 is a very, very common pant size.

01:51.570 --> 01:54.865
It'd be great if we could go a day without
you mentioning your 32-inch waist size.

01:54.865 --> 01:55.991
No, this is urgent.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.952
Se√±or Kaplan cut my
<i>Wind Beneath My Wings</i> number

01:59.036 --> 02:01.163
at the Faculty Follies for "time."

02:01.496 --> 02:05.125
So I'm turning him in to the IRS
for deducting his breakfast burritos.

02:05.209 --> 02:07.461
You're wasting your life
with these rivalries.

02:07.461 --> 02:11.298
There is a guy at work who always eats
my peanut butter, but I just let it go.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.175
Because life's too short, and so is he.

02:13.175 --> 02:16.094
And maybe the peanut butter's just
his creamy substitute for human affection.

02:16.178 --> 02:18.305
Okay? Can we go? Can we please go?

02:18.305 --> 02:19.515
- Okay, yes.
- Thank you.

02:20.224 --> 02:21.433
Oh, my gosh.

02:21.517 --> 02:22.601
Um, uh...

02:22.601 --> 02:24.811
- Can we help you?
- Name's Murray Clark.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.480
I grew up in this house.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.606
Oh!

02:27.606 --> 02:30.734
Hi. Well, my name is Cameron.
This is my husband Mitchell.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.528
Well, that's funny.

02:33.237 --> 02:35.656
Okay, so we were just about to leave.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.949
See, I get all my pants...

02:36.949 --> 02:39.535
I haven't seen this house
since I went off to war.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.746
Oh! And you'd like to come in
and take a look around a little bit?

02:42.746 --> 02:44.248
No, nothing like that.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.583
I just came here to die.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.877
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry?

02:48.961 --> 02:51.839
It's nothing sad. I'll just be a minute.

02:54.591 --> 02:55.592
Yeah.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.929
Actually, can I get a juice first?

02:58.929 --> 03:01.223
- Of course. Sure. Yeah.
- Why not?

03:03.684 --> 03:05.686
- What are you doing?
- Being a gracious host.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.437
To a stranger who wants to die here?

03:07.521 --> 03:10.274
Come on, Mitchell. Nothing's gonna happen.
It's just a cry for help.

03:10.274 --> 03:12.943
Okay, if I can't get a pair
of slim-cut chinos in French blue,

03:12.943 --> 03:14.236
you're gonna die here.

03:14.236 --> 03:17.614
- Marvin? Milton?
- No, it's Murray. Murray?

03:18.323 --> 03:19.324
- Murray?
- Murray?

03:19.491 --> 03:20.534
Oh, my God. Did he actually die?

03:20.534 --> 03:22.369
Calm down! I'm first-aid certified.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.288
Murray? Murray!

03:24.288 --> 03:26.456
Who taught you first-aid?
A nanny on death row?

03:26.540 --> 03:27.958
- Murray, come to!
- Damn it!

03:28.375 --> 03:31.753
I flew coach all the way
from Florida to die in this house.

03:31.837 --> 03:32.963
And you ruined it.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.381
Oh, my God, that's insane.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.383
You knew you were gonna die,
and you flew coach?

03:37.467 --> 03:38.594
What are you doing?

03:38.594 --> 03:42.222
I'm trying to spruce up my resume.
This job hunt is killing me.

03:42.306 --> 03:45.517
I'm sorry, Mom. But if those companies
aren't smart enough to hire you,

03:45.601 --> 03:47.269
you don't want to work with them anyway.

03:47.269 --> 03:49.062
That's what you used to tell
Alex about boys.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.564
Just don't jump at the first offer.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.482
That's what I used to tell you about boys.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.235
He's here! He's here!

03:55.319 --> 03:58.447
Today, our old neighbor turned tech titan
Kenneth is coming to visit

03:58.447 --> 04:00.532
and he says he has
a "big surprise" for me.

04:00.949 --> 04:04.161
I don't know if the super-rich have
access to time travel, but if they do,

04:04.161 --> 04:05.370
I'm going back to the '90s.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.581
To buy a whole bunch of Amazon stock.

04:07.581 --> 04:12.169
No. I'm gonna tell Felicity
not to cut her hair.

04:13.545 --> 04:15.339
Yeah!

04:20.761 --> 04:23.138
- Haley, come here.
- No, I'm good.

04:23.222 --> 04:25.307
We're not letting go of each other
until you get in here.

04:25.307 --> 04:26.391
Haley, get in the hug.

04:26.475 --> 04:28.060
Ah!

04:28.060 --> 04:30.270
This feels so good.

04:30.354 --> 04:32.189
Who needs hugs when you can...

04:32.189 --> 04:33.899
- Man-shake?
- Man-shake!

04:33.899 --> 04:35.442
You're gonna wanna give them
some space for this.

04:37.361 --> 04:38.362
Pow!

04:40.989 --> 04:42.491
Ooh! What are the cameras for?

04:42.991 --> 04:44.201
Huh? Oh!

04:44.201 --> 04:46.703
This is for a documentary
about tech visionaries

04:46.787 --> 04:49.122
going back to thank the people
who inspired them.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.667
Elon Musk got his math teacher an island.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.253
What am I getting? Assuming it's me.

04:54.253 --> 04:55.796
- Well, are the cameras rolling?
- Yes.

04:56.713 --> 05:00.342
What is the one thing that we have
always dreamed of doing together?

05:00.342 --> 05:01.927
Going to college in New York
with Felicity?

05:02.302 --> 05:04.972
No. This man right here,

05:05.305 --> 05:09.476
he taught me to always dream big,
and reach for the stars.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.479
And as a thank you, Phil,

05:12.688 --> 05:15.232
would you make me
the happiest man on Earth

05:15.607 --> 05:18.026
and leave Earth with me?

05:18.443 --> 05:19.778
What?

05:19.862 --> 05:22.072
I just got us two tickets

05:22.072 --> 05:27.703
on the next Russian flight
to the International Space Station!

05:27.703 --> 05:29.997
This is the most amazing thing
that's ever happened to me!

05:30.330 --> 05:31.456
Except, of course,

05:33.166 --> 05:36.170
winning two non-consecutive
Realtor of the Year awards.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.088
I'm gonna cry.

05:38.547 --> 05:40.716
Don't cry yet. I'm so sorry.
We had a sound issue.

05:40.716 --> 05:42.134
- Can we do all that again?
- Yeah.

05:42.134 --> 05:44.219
Should we take it back to the hug?

05:47.764 --> 05:49.933
So tickets for my show today
are at will call,

05:50.017 --> 05:51.894
and good news,
I was able to get you comps.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.605
I'm sure it'll cost me in other ways.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.607
It's from Dad. "I'm almost there."

05:56.607 --> 05:59.818
If "almost there" was a place,
Javier would be the mayor.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.237
Please stop taking
potshots at his expense.

06:02.321 --> 06:05.657
Potshots are the only thing
that we can take at his expense.

06:05.741 --> 06:08.535
I mean it, Mom. You even poison Joe.

06:08.619 --> 06:10.412
You mean with her cooking?

06:10.412 --> 06:12.998
Hey, we're only making fun of Javier.

06:12.998 --> 06:16.251
- No, we're not. Promise me.
- Okay, fine, I promise.

06:16.335 --> 06:20.422
If my good-natured ribbing is making
you uncomfortable, I will refrain.

06:21.590 --> 06:24.635
I've got her on "word a day" cards.
We'll see how long it holds.

06:26.303 --> 06:29.389
<i>- Hola,</i> Gloria.
- Javier, hi.

06:30.015 --> 06:33.769
Nice teeth. Did you get them
at the dentist or at the piano store?

06:33.769 --> 06:36.271
I haven't seen anything
so white and square

06:36.355 --> 06:38.357
since the Mormons knocked on my door.

06:38.357 --> 06:40.901
And those were just
off the top of my head.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.653
But I promised Manny, so...

06:43.237 --> 06:44.571
Nice to see you. Come in.

06:45.364 --> 06:47.115
Hey, Dad!
- There's my boy!

06:47.366 --> 06:50.244
Whee!

06:50.244 --> 06:53.872
Someone has been wearing
my custom-made cologne.

06:54.164 --> 06:58.085
Javier, for the man who wants
to smell a little bit like a woman.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.504
- Thanks for coming to my show, Dad.
- Of course. I wouldn't miss it.

07:00.504 --> 07:03.382
But, hey, that is not the only
reason I am in town.

07:03.382 --> 07:07.761
I have a proposition,
something for you to chew on.

07:08.887 --> 07:12.724
Couldn't you chew on it for us
with your giant new beaver mouth?

07:13.684 --> 07:16.854
I don't know why I made that
stupid promise. I am on fire.

07:16.854 --> 07:19.982
I was in a high-stakes
poker game with a king high flush.

07:19.982 --> 07:22.985
- So, I bet my house.
- No, no, no, no, no.

07:22.985 --> 07:25.612
- You're not living in Manny's room.
- I won

07:25.737 --> 07:28.031
a yearlong cruise around the world.

07:28.115 --> 07:31.118
I want you to set sail with me
for the entire voyage.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.953
- What?
- Absolutely not.

07:32.953 --> 07:36.039
I should ask my gal at Nordstrom's
to pull some cruise looks for me.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.041
Look at him. He's chomping at the bit.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.293
Stop setting me up!

07:42.421 --> 07:46.049
Here you go. A cup of joe.
The old-fashioned way.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.551
Thanks, Margaret.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.639
Oh, God. Is there bourbon in this?

07:52.723 --> 07:56.643
When you asked for coffee,
didn't you give me a wink-wink?

07:56.727 --> 07:59.938
- No. It's the morning.
- That's why there's coffee in it.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.901
Could you just make me
a lunch reservation, please?

08:03.901 --> 08:05.861
Oh! No problem.

08:06.737 --> 08:07.821
What's that thing?

08:07.905 --> 08:11.491
Oh. These are all the great restaurants
that Jay used to go to.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.411
Do you like Steak Diane?

08:15.913 --> 08:19.166
It took her 12 tries to find
a place that had a salad.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.252
Uh, what are you doing?

08:22.336 --> 08:26.048
Oh, I was just getting the couch
ready for your afternoon "meeting."

08:26.048 --> 08:28.383
Why are we saying "meeting"
like it's not really a meeting?

08:28.884 --> 08:32.721
Just so you know, when I say something,
that's exactly what I mean.

08:33.096 --> 08:36.016
Also, when you called me from your car,
I couldn't really understand you.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.434
You may want to fix your Bluetooth.

08:37.768 --> 08:42.105
Oh! You noticed. The nerve died
a few years ago.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.900
But if it bothers you,
I'll have it yanked.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.987
So, Manny, what is your show about?

08:49.404 --> 08:51.740
Will there be pirates and tasteful nudity?

08:51.740 --> 08:53.408
It'll be different from my last one.

08:53.492 --> 08:56.286
This is a one-man play
in which I portray four characters

08:56.370 --> 08:58.413
in a caf√© from different walks of life.

08:58.497 --> 09:01.291
When the Internet goes out,
they're forced to talk to each other.

09:01.375 --> 09:04.837
I call it <i>Who, What, When, Where, Wi-Fi.</i>

09:04.837 --> 09:06.004
I'd throw in a pirate.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.131
I should go get into characters.

09:10.092 --> 09:14.555
Manny's not going on that trip.
I know what an adventure with you means.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.431
Seedy bars, con men,

09:16.515 --> 09:18.475
souvenir pens that when you flip them,

09:18.559 --> 09:20.143
the ladies' clothes come off.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.354
If my son wants to spend
some time with me,

09:22.354 --> 09:25.232
he should be able to. Jay, back me up.

09:25.357 --> 09:26.525
He's not gonna "back you up."

09:26.525 --> 09:28.569
Gloria, let Manny go
on the trip. He'll be fine.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.487
He's been 40 since he was 10.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.739
And he's been 10 for 40 years.

09:32.823 --> 09:35.617
- It's not happening.
- Look, I understand your concern.

09:35.701 --> 09:38.161
But I want to bond with Manny
before it's too late.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.665
I think I'm having a midlife crisis.

09:41.665 --> 09:44.251
You probably didn't notice,
but I got veneers.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.752
That's what that is.

09:47.296 --> 09:48.797
Please, don't die in our house.

09:48.881 --> 09:50.007
What the hell do you care?

09:50.007 --> 09:51.842
For starters, if we ever want
to sell this place,

09:51.842 --> 09:53.510
we'll have to disclose
that someone died here.

09:53.594 --> 09:54.970
Why? The last owners didn't.

09:54.970 --> 09:57.139
For the millionth time,
I moved that chair.

09:57.139 --> 09:59.892
My wife passed years ago.
I don't have any other family.

09:59.892 --> 10:02.644
I just want to close my eyes
and drift off.

10:02.728 --> 10:05.022
There are lots of reasons
to want to continue to live.

10:05.022 --> 10:06.356
I know you miss your missus.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.358
But living alone is underrated.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.652
For one, you can have
whatever you want for dinner.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.363
Two, you can move the couch
wherever you'd like.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.866
It's been 10 years.
Where would the couch look better?

10:15.866 --> 10:18.619
I appreciate what you think
passes for support.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.495
I'm just not interested.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.539
I think you need
a more positive outlook on life.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.541
Our neighbor Herschel,
he's about your age.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.418
- Herschel Braverman?
- Yeah.

10:26.502 --> 10:27.628
We grew up together.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.880
We love Herschel. We bring him
a corned beef sandwich

10:30.005 --> 10:31.673
- every time we go to the deli.
- Yeah, see?

10:31.757 --> 10:33.759
There's something to live for.
You should go.

10:33.759 --> 10:35.511
Reunite with your old friend right now.

10:35.511 --> 10:38.222
Okay, you know what?
Don't be rude. We'll walk him over.

10:38.222 --> 10:41.225
He's just in a hurry to get to a pants
sale that started 30 minutes ago.

10:41.225 --> 10:43.477
- What are you, a 32?
- I am.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.396
All the good stuff's already gone.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.902
If you guys want to keep up with
the Russians, you're gonna have to train.

10:52.569 --> 10:53.654
I'll get the vodka.

10:55.364 --> 10:58.784
If I could build a fembot with lifelike
skin, it would be just like her.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.786
Did you get a weird vibe from Claire?

11:00.786 --> 11:03.121
No, she seemed super positive
and supportive.

11:03.205 --> 11:04.414
That's exactly what I mean.

11:05.707 --> 11:08.752
Oh! While I'm here, I'm gonna see
if we have any Tang.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.338
I don't want to go to space,
Claire. I'm terrified.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.508
What happens if I break something
and we can't breathe? Oh, my God.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.926
Oh, my God, I can't breathe right now.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.971
Honey, calm down. The Russians
know what they're doing.

11:19.263 --> 11:20.722
I'm gonna die up there!

11:20.806 --> 11:22.474
Just tell him you don't wanna go.

11:22.558 --> 11:24.393
This is such an amazing gift.
It'll crush him.

11:24.393 --> 11:26.687
Plus, I'll look like a coward
in that documentary.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.522
You're right. We don't wanna
see this on film.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.232
I'm taping over it already in my mind.

11:30.232 --> 11:31.942
- You've gotta shut this down.
- What?

11:31.942 --> 11:33.944
Help me, Claire. You're my only hope.

11:34.403 --> 11:38.073
Fine. But if I do this, you're not allowed
to quote <i>Star Wars</i> to me anymore.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.033
- I love you.
- I know.

11:43.161 --> 11:46.915
Hey, Kenneth, I was just talking
to Buzzkill Aldrin over here...

11:46.999 --> 11:49.293
Claire, I hope you don't mind terribly,
but I was just taking a peek

11:49.293 --> 11:51.795
at your resume. It is very impressive.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.381
- Have you landed anywhere?
- Not yet, no.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.967
Yeah, speaking
of landings, unfortunately...

11:56.967 --> 12:00.012
Really? We should talk about
a really interesting job opportunity

12:00.012 --> 12:02.848
- that just opened up at my company.
- I would love that.

12:02.848 --> 12:06.101
I'm looking for a bold candidate
who loves to take chances.

12:06.435 --> 12:10.397
No, you are looking at a bold candidate
who loves to take chances.

12:12.024 --> 12:15.277
I know, but still,
Claire has some concerns.

12:16.987 --> 12:19.072
If I'm working for you,
do I still get hugs?

12:19.156 --> 12:22.951
No, not in this climate.
Best I can offer is a wo-man-shake.

12:23.035 --> 12:24.119
What?

12:24.203 --> 12:25.913
Uh-uh-phew!

12:26.580 --> 12:29.082
- You are a quick study.
- How am I doing this?

12:31.293 --> 12:33.712
Remember, shred this. Don't fax it.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.006
- Hey, honey.
- Hi, Grandpa.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.549
Cup of coffee, Margaret?

12:38.634 --> 12:39.635
Grandpa, what are you doing here?

12:39.635 --> 12:43.430
Terrible thing happened today at Manny's
one-man show. He got me a ticket.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.517
No, I just stopped in to see
how Margaret's working out.

12:46.517 --> 12:50.103
She's not. As much as I enjoyed
her pairing the glass of Chablis

12:50.187 --> 12:51.855
with my surprise shrimp cocktail,

12:52.397 --> 12:54.107
that's not a skill I need in an assistant.

12:54.650 --> 12:55.859
You have to fire her.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.819
I can't. She worked for me her whole life.

12:57.903 --> 13:00.656
She slept on the sidewalk
to get me Nancy Sinatra tickets.

13:00.656 --> 13:01.740
Fine, I'll do it.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.867
Margaret, could you come in here please?

13:03.951 --> 13:05.452
This is the second thing today
I can't watch.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.414
I did everything I could for you.
She's a cold one.

13:10.040 --> 13:13.335
What's going on here? Am I fired?

13:13.335 --> 13:16.171
- I'm afraid so.
- Oh! Thank God.

13:16.463 --> 13:20.717
I've been wanting to retire for years now,
but I could never let Jay down.

13:20.884 --> 13:24.054
I just want to sleep,
tend my cannabis garden,

13:24.054 --> 13:26.223
and never work again.

13:26.223 --> 13:28.517
Margaret, I want you back at Dog Beds.

13:28.517 --> 13:32.104
Oh! Whatever you say, Jay.
See you tomorrow.

13:32.104 --> 13:34.857
No. Grandpa, Margaret wants to retire.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.985
It's not what I want, it's what Jay needs.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.736
Ugh! What is wrong with you two?

13:40.112 --> 13:42.656
You don't need an assistant,
and she doesn't wanna work anymore.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.491
Is this true? Do you really
wanna hang it up?

13:44.575 --> 13:47.202
There are some things
I wouldn't mind trying.

13:47.286 --> 13:49.079
Well, then you should do it. I'll manage.

13:49.204 --> 13:50.330
It's gonna be weird, though.

13:50.414 --> 13:53.000
I mean, you're the longest
relationship I've ever had.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.920
Four husbands,
three heart attacks, countless lovers,

13:57.379 --> 13:59.506
and you stood by me through it all.

14:00.716 --> 14:01.800
I love you, Jay.

14:04.261 --> 14:05.304
I love you, too, Margaret.

14:06.722 --> 14:09.600
- It's been a great run.
- And we'll always have Mitchell.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.518
- What?
- She's messing with you.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.939
No, our kid moved away a long time ago.

14:19.443 --> 14:22.905
Hey, forget what I told you earlier.
It's okay to hire the hot one.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.531
You may make a friend for life.

14:27.451 --> 14:29.620
Hey, fellas!

14:29.620 --> 14:31.705
- Hey, Herschel.
- You bring me a sandwich?

14:31.705 --> 14:33.957
- No, we didn't go to the deli today.
- Eh!

14:34.041 --> 14:38.545
No, no, wait. But how about a trip
down memory lane instead?

14:40.047 --> 14:43.008
Wait, wait, wait. Herschel, look.
We have your old friend.

14:43.008 --> 14:45.219
- Murray Clark!
- Murray Clark!

14:45.761 --> 14:47.179
Well, what do you know?

14:47.554 --> 14:48.555
Hello, Hersch.

14:48.639 --> 14:50.182
It's been a lifetime.

14:50.641 --> 14:53.435
Don't give me that,
you smug son of a bitch.

14:53.519 --> 14:55.270
What's happening?

14:55.354 --> 14:58.774
This bastard told our football coach
I was a communist.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.567
Got me kicked off the team.

15:00.692 --> 15:01.860
I could've gone pro.

15:01.944 --> 15:05.197
I only did that 'cause he stole
my paper route.

15:05.197 --> 15:08.158
I had to deliver ice to support my family.

15:08.242 --> 15:09.701
Deliver ice? How old are you guys?

15:09.785 --> 15:11.912
- You're a snake.
- You're a rat.

15:11.912 --> 15:14.248
He stole my girl when I went to war.

15:14.248 --> 15:16.208
And he stayed home with a fake limp.

15:16.208 --> 15:19.169
You should be grateful.
That woman gave me the clap.

15:19.253 --> 15:21.129
That was a little gift from me.

15:22.756 --> 15:25.217
- Murray, what the heck was that?
- Just the beginning.

15:25.217 --> 15:26.552
The beginning?

15:27.886 --> 15:30.138
Murray? What are you doing, buddy?

15:30.806 --> 15:32.474
Nobody talks to me like that.

15:35.727 --> 15:37.813
Fine. I'm taking it.

15:38.564 --> 15:39.773
When I get home,

15:39.857 --> 15:42.734
I'm gonna sign him up
for a bunch of those fringe religions.

15:42.818 --> 15:45.696
Let's see how he likes getting
all those singing visitors.

15:45.696 --> 15:49.491
And all those free Bibles.
I'm gonna ruin the rest of his life.

15:49.575 --> 15:51.743
See, look, Mitchell,
he's making plans for the future.

15:51.827 --> 15:54.079
That's why you have rivals.
It's something to live for.

15:54.079 --> 15:55.914
Okay, you're just justifying bad behavior.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.292
Murray, Mitchell has somebody at work
that keeps stealing his peanut butter,

15:58.292 --> 15:59.668
and he won't do anything about it.

15:59.668 --> 16:02.921
You wanna stop it?
Try mixing in some laxatives.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.966
And then put an "Under Construction" sign
on the bathroom door.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.010
And if you really wanna ruin his day...

16:08.010 --> 16:10.053
- Hold on. Let me write this down.
- Right.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.513
You call his wife...

16:12.806 --> 16:14.641
Hey, the Wi-Fi is out.

16:17.603 --> 16:21.356
Huge bummer, man. I was just
about to finish writing my poem.

16:23.192 --> 16:26.320
You're a writer, too? Well,
knock me over with a feather.

16:26.320 --> 16:30.949
Blaine Lamarr. Playwright. Power
used to go out all the time in the Bayou.

16:32.034 --> 16:36.455
So crazy. I'm writing a movie
set in the Bayou called <i>Swamp Cops.</i>

16:36.455 --> 16:40.167
I'm in film school, but soon,
everyone's gonna know my name.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.251
Keith Fank!

16:41.627 --> 16:43.587
I couldn't help overhearing.

16:43.587 --> 16:46.632
I'm Rhonda Jamowitz,
gossip columnist for the local rag.

16:46.632 --> 16:50.552
You'll never guess which starlet
was in here yesterday with a new man.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.095
And a newer nose.

16:53.430 --> 16:56.308
I was hoping that the play
was gonna get better.

16:56.308 --> 16:58.644
With maybe a little less Rhonda.

16:59.144 --> 17:00.979
I know I'm going on and on,

17:01.063 --> 17:04.316
but for the first time
since Mother passed, I don't feel alone.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.736
Brilliant. I don't miss the nudity at all.

17:07.736 --> 17:09.905
We're so worried about staying connected,

17:10.322 --> 17:12.574
ignoring the walls that are being erected,

17:12.658 --> 17:14.660
we let the information confound us,

17:15.035 --> 17:17.287
when there's so much love
swirling around us.

17:18.038 --> 17:20.874
That all we need to do is...

17:20.958 --> 17:22.125
Wi-Fi's back on.

17:33.262 --> 17:34.972
I blame myself.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.057
You got an A? Have a hat.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.600
You skin your knee? Have a hat.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.645
Sorry for making you guys wait.

17:41.645 --> 17:44.481
It took me a little longer than I thought
to find my way back to Manny.

17:44.565 --> 17:47.192
Bravo, bravo. Another triumph, eh?

17:47.276 --> 17:50.153
Thanks. You know, I really think
I have something here.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.489
Maybe instead of going on that cruise,
I should stay home and...

17:52.573 --> 17:54.366
You are going on that cruise.

17:55.284 --> 17:56.618
It's gonna be good for you.

17:56.702 --> 18:00.330
It's so important for your father.
He planned a whole adventure.

18:00.414 --> 18:02.124
We'll drink tequila in Honduras.

18:02.457 --> 18:03.876
We'll swim with the dolphins in Bali.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.627
But when we travel
through the Panama Canal,

18:05.711 --> 18:07.880
we'll be required to do
some light housekeeping.

18:07.880 --> 18:08.964
It's part of the deal.

18:09.965 --> 18:13.343
Okay, then. I'll just go grab my stuff
and take some selfies with my fan.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.680
Gloria, <i>dime.</i>

18:16.680 --> 18:19.057
Why are you suddenly so onboard
with this trip?

18:19.141 --> 18:21.143
I've sheltered him for too long.

18:21.143 --> 18:24.396
He needs something real
that he can write about.

18:24.855 --> 18:27.357
Take him to the seediest bars.

18:27.441 --> 18:31.653
Introduce him to con men.
Let him taste danger.

18:32.029 --> 18:35.616
But no shrimp because it makes
his eyelid feel funny.

18:37.117 --> 18:40.537
No, <i>se√±or.</i> The cycle ends here!

18:43.749 --> 18:46.001
Really? You just sold me out for a job?

18:46.001 --> 18:48.170
Honey, he wants a risk-taker.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.422
How's it gonna look if I squash
your boys' trip?

18:50.964 --> 18:53.675
Boys' trip? We're leaving the planet.

18:53.759 --> 18:56.512
You know the scariest part
of a rollercoaster? It's a month of that!

18:56.803 --> 18:58.347
Dad, you don't wanna go to space?

18:58.472 --> 19:02.434
No, I do. I worry that it might be
too traumatic for you.

19:02.518 --> 19:05.479
No, it'll be fun to tell the kids
their pop-pop is an astronaut.

19:05.479 --> 19:07.272
Pop-pop might be the last sound I make.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.608
Claire, if it's not too much trouble,

19:09.608 --> 19:13.820
would you please pick out a family photo
for me to clutch after my tether snaps

19:13.904 --> 19:15.906
and I tumble endlessly through the void?

19:15.906 --> 19:20.661
It is much more likely that
you will just incinerate upon reentry.

19:20.661 --> 19:21.912
You guys talking about space?

19:22.496 --> 19:25.207
Yeah. Um... Look, buddy,

19:25.207 --> 19:27.918
I appreciate all this,
but I don't wanna go.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.878
- What?
- I'm sorry.

19:29.962 --> 19:31.547
I'm just so scared.

19:31.547 --> 19:34.800
But you're my rock.
I can't do this without you.

19:34.800 --> 19:35.926
I'm your rock?

19:36.677 --> 19:38.220
What did I get us into?

19:39.304 --> 19:40.931
I didn't even wanna go.

19:41.723 --> 19:44.434
I just wanted to look cool
in front of Bezos,

19:44.893 --> 19:47.187
and Elon and Zok Zok.

19:47.855 --> 19:50.107
That's the reason why you're going?

19:50.107 --> 19:53.777
I'm sorry, but launching white dudes
into space hasn't been cool for years.

19:53.861 --> 19:57.114
The cameras.
How am I gonna get out of this?

19:57.114 --> 20:00.242
If you're trying to look cool,
just throw some splashy event,

20:00.242 --> 20:01.952
and auction off the space trip to charity.

20:02.286 --> 20:04.663
That could work. What kind of charity?

20:04.663 --> 20:06.790
- Wolves are hot right now.
- I love that.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.792
I'm gonna save the wolves.

20:09.126 --> 20:10.794
- We're saving them, right?
- Yeah.

20:10.878 --> 20:12.963
I like the way you think outside the box.

20:12.963 --> 20:16.008
I may have a really interesting
job opportunity for you.

20:16.008 --> 20:17.968
Haley, we could be working together.

20:17.968 --> 20:19.720
No, it's really just the one job.

20:20.012 --> 20:23.265
And, Phil, while it's not a trip to space,

20:23.724 --> 20:26.685
I hope that the Phil Dunphy Center
for Wolves

20:26.685 --> 20:29.563
will be a fitting honor
for the man who changed my life.

20:29.563 --> 20:32.191
We'll have a big opening ceremony.

20:32.566 --> 20:35.944
You'll meet all the wolves. Now let's go
do this again in front of the cameras.

20:39.823 --> 20:42.159
I'm terrified of wolves.

20:45.037 --> 20:46.455
Oh! Good, you're here.

20:46.455 --> 20:49.625
Manny's about to model
his new cruise wear for me.

20:49.625 --> 20:50.792
This should be good.

20:50.876 --> 20:53.003
Jay, don't make him self-conscious.

20:53.003 --> 20:54.463
Promise you're going to be nice.

20:56.173 --> 20:58.050
- Very smart.
- Thanks, Mom.

20:58.175 --> 20:59.676
Jay, what do you think?

21:01.011 --> 21:02.763
Hey, <i>El Capit√°n</i> Kangaroo.

21:02.763 --> 21:04.723
What are you, the Untalented Mr. Ripley?

21:04.723 --> 21:06.892
You should be directing traffic
in the Bahamas.

21:06.892 --> 21:09.353
Tennille called... Did I do that one yet?

21:09.353 --> 21:13.690
Anyway, she thinks you look like the kid
in an '80s movie we're supposed to hate.

21:14.942 --> 21:16.193
You look amazing.

21:16.193 --> 21:19.863
Amazingly like the last Kennedy
picked at a touch-football game.

21:19.947 --> 21:22.074
These are too good. I gotta tell him.

21:22.074 --> 21:24.368
Manny, put the outfit back on.
