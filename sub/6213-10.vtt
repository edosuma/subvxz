WEBVTT

00:03.237 --> 00:03.802
Wish me luck.

00:03.802 --> 00:05.437
I'm going into Mike's
office with an idea

00:05.437 --> 00:07.372
and I'm coming out
with my own column.

00:07.372 --> 00:09.708
I really admire your
determination, Sabrina.

00:09.708 --> 00:10.809
I mean, who else
could go in there

00:10.809 --> 00:12.244
with such
a positive attitude

00:12.244 --> 00:13.512
knowing that Mike
has shot down

00:13.512 --> 00:16.348
every intern who's ever
tried to write for the paper.

00:16.348 --> 00:18.350
I didn't know that.

00:18.350 --> 00:19.584
Oh, I just made that up.

00:19.584 --> 00:20.685
Funny joke, huh?

00:20.685 --> 00:22.654
Yeah-- undermining
my confidence

00:22.654 --> 00:24.389
at the pivotal point
in my career.

00:24.389 --> 00:25.357
A laugh riot.

00:25.357 --> 00:27.526
Wait, let me rephrase that.

00:27.526 --> 00:29.561
Good luck, you're going
to knock him dead.

00:30.395 --> 00:31.630
Much better.

00:32.164 --> 00:33.265
Mm-hmm.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.435
Well...

00:37.302 --> 00:38.870
Have a seat.

00:38.870 --> 00:40.439
Yeah.

00:40.439 --> 00:42.107
No, no.

00:42.107 --> 00:44.676
I'm just finishing up
with Anna Quindlen.

00:44.676 --> 00:46.878
Oh, my God, Anna Quindlen.

00:46.878 --> 00:49.748
Look, Quindlen, I don't care
how many Pulitzers you've won.

00:49.748 --> 00:52.451
Your piece on antidepressants
was, frankly, a downer.

00:52.451 --> 00:55.921
It wouldn't hurt to reacquaint
yourself with punctuation.

00:57.389 --> 00:58.557
So, Spellman,
what do you want?

00:58.557 --> 01:00.025
Oh, nothing.

01:00.025 --> 01:01.860
I just, you know,
was thinking about...

01:01.860 --> 01:04.262
ordering a new swivel chair
for my house

01:04.262 --> 01:06.865
and this one seems
very swivelly.

01:06.865 --> 01:08.033
Got to go.

01:08.033 --> 01:09.668
Wait a minute-- you got
a folder in your hand

01:09.668 --> 01:11.837
that says
"Ideas for Mike."

01:11.837 --> 01:14.906
Oh, well, I kind of had
an idea for a column.

01:14.906 --> 01:16.441
Well, why don't you
kind of spit it out?

01:16.441 --> 01:17.976
Okay, well, the Boston area

01:17.976 --> 01:19.644
has more than
30 college campuses.

01:19.644 --> 01:20.712
I mean,
they're all over the place

01:20.712 --> 01:23.381
like Starbucks
and Regis Philbin.

01:23.381 --> 01:25.350
I just thought there might be
a huge audience

01:25.350 --> 01:27.118
for a column
about college students

01:27.118 --> 01:28.820
and the issues they face.

01:28.820 --> 01:29.788
Go on.

01:30.455 --> 01:32.357
Well, um, for example

01:32.357 --> 01:34.426
college life is
very stressful.

01:34.426 --> 01:35.494
You want stressful?

01:35.961 --> 01:37.796
Take a look at
my last angiogram.

01:37.796 --> 01:38.997
What's your angle?

01:38.997 --> 01:41.600
Most students are
up to their necks in loans.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.335
But how can they
have time to study

01:43.335 --> 01:45.971
when they have to take
menial jobs just to stay afloat?

01:45.971 --> 01:50.408
So, sacrificing their future
just to survive in the present.

01:51.009 --> 01:52.444
That's, that's very good.

01:52.444 --> 01:53.378
You think so?

01:53.378 --> 01:54.412
Yeah.

01:54.412 --> 01:56.548
So did the <i>New York Times</i>
<i>magazine section.</i>

01:56.548 --> 01:58.984
They ran a piece on it
six months ago.

01:58.984 --> 02:03.188
Oh, well, how about
this topic-- sex.

02:03.188 --> 02:05.557
Hot topic, hot-hot-hot.

02:05.557 --> 02:06.992
What about sex?

02:06.992 --> 02:09.261
Well, most students
wrestle with the pressure.

02:09.261 --> 02:11.263
I mean, morally,
they may want to abstain

02:11.263 --> 02:12.631
yet the media bombards them

02:12.631 --> 02:14.633
with a constant stream of
sexual imagery.

02:14.633 --> 02:16.868
Now that's very timely

02:16.868 --> 02:19.304
which is why it was
on the cover of <i>Time.</i>

02:19.304 --> 02:22.440
Oh, well, what about
any of these topics?

02:25.911 --> 02:28.246
I'll tell you what,
I like them all.

02:28.246 --> 02:30.682
Unfortunately,
I've also read them all.

02:30.682 --> 02:31.383
This proves that

02:31.383 --> 02:32.617
you have good instincts,
Sabrina.

02:32.617 --> 02:34.586
Now, I want you
to keep at it, okay?

02:34.586 --> 02:36.221
I'm sure you're going
to come up with something.

02:36.221 --> 02:37.956
You're right. Thanks.

02:37.956 --> 02:39.491
Oh, I've got it!

02:39.491 --> 02:41.626
College students--
give them a second chance

02:41.626 --> 02:43.361
and they'll come up
with something.

02:43.361 --> 02:44.863
Keep thinking.

02:46.264 --> 02:48.900
College students--
they keep thinking.

03:45.991 --> 03:47.826
Quite well, I might add.

03:47.826 --> 03:50.128
Oh, my new hobby
is so relaxing.

03:50.128 --> 03:51.563
SALEM:
Maybe for you

03:51.563 --> 03:53.198
but I'm trying to concentrate on

03:53.198 --> 03:56.835
expanding
my intellectual horizons.

03:56.835 --> 03:59.604
"There once was a witch

04:01.873 --> 04:04.309
Salem, who's sending you
this garbage?

04:04.309 --> 04:07.479
NastyGirl, at theslammer.org.

04:07.479 --> 04:09.881
Me-ow.

04:10.413 --> 04:12.549
Oh, I wish
this airhead NastyGirl

04:12.549 --> 04:14.784
would stop sending me
these stupid limericks.

04:14.784 --> 04:15.952
At least you
get limericks.

04:15.952 --> 04:17.487
I get letters
condemning me to hell

04:17.487 --> 04:18.755
if I don't
reply immediately.

04:18.755 --> 04:20.690
Never give your email address
to your mother.

04:20.690 --> 04:22.826
I am so close to getting
my own column for the newspaper

04:22.826 --> 04:24.961
I don't have time
to deal with this.

04:25.461 --> 04:26.763
"Dear Airhead--

04:26.763 --> 04:29.699
"Stop harassing me
with your annoying emails.

04:29.699 --> 04:32.969
They're nothing but
mindless garbage."

04:32.969 --> 04:34.504
Could you forward that
to my mother?

04:34.504 --> 04:35.672
Miles, I need a hook.

04:35.672 --> 04:37.407
Say I was writing
an insightful

04:37.407 --> 04:38.975
sophisticated
article on sex.

04:38.975 --> 04:40.543
What would a good angle be?

04:40.543 --> 04:41.945
Why I'm not having any?

04:41.945 --> 04:43.813
Say the story was about stress.

04:43.813 --> 04:46.149
Why I'm the poster boy
for stress.

04:46.149 --> 04:48.151
Suppose the story
wasn't about you.

04:48.151 --> 04:49.819
Then you're on your own.

04:53.223 --> 04:54.824
Airhead?

04:54.824 --> 04:57.126
Mindless garbage?

04:57.126 --> 05:00.396
I may be an evil twin,
but I still have feelings.

05:00.396 --> 05:02.832
Let's see, I could
turn the other cheek

05:02.832 --> 05:05.201
forgive and forget, or...

05:05.935 --> 05:07.203
ruin Sabrina's life

05:07.203 --> 05:10.039
by emailing her
a nasty computer virus.

05:10.039 --> 05:13.142
Ha, we'll see
who's the airhead now.

05:13.743 --> 05:14.611
COMPUTER:
Email.

05:14.711 --> 05:16.646
"Apologies from NastyGirl."

05:16.646 --> 05:19.182
Good, I guess whoever it is
got the message.

05:19.916 --> 05:21.217

05:21.217 --> 05:23.419
Whoa, what was that?

05:23.419 --> 05:24.888
( <i>sneezes</i> )

05:26.956 --> 05:30.393
Oh, my God, that was like,
so weird.

05:31.027 --> 05:32.595
They say ignorance is bliss.

05:32.595 --> 05:35.298
Sabrina, you're about to be
very, very happy.

05:35.298 --> 05:37.634
( <i>laughing evilly</i> )

05:39.402 --> 05:41.437
Spellman, you're not going
to believe what I just heard.

05:41.437 --> 05:45.441
Adams is thinking about
cutting scholarships by 25%.

05:45.441 --> 05:46.042
Whatever.

05:46.042 --> 05:49.279
Hey, what do you think if
I highlighted my eyebrows?

05:49.279 --> 05:50.480
Maybe you didn't hear me.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.849
This is something that could
affect my entire future.

05:52.849 --> 05:55.952
Oh, and the color of my eyebrows
doesn't affect mine?

05:55.952 --> 05:57.654
I mean, if I go even
one shade too dark

05:57.654 --> 05:58.721
it could, like,
totally trash

05:58.721 --> 06:00.490
all the work I've done
with my hair!

06:00.490 --> 06:01.491
What's going on with you?

06:01.491 --> 06:04.327
Did all your brains
fall out of your head?

06:04.327 --> 06:06.396
Oh, no, I don't see
any brains.

06:06.396 --> 06:08.398
Oh! Although I did
find a nickel.

06:08.398 --> 06:09.632
Whoo-hoo!

06:09.632 --> 06:12.068
Here, you can put that
toward your college fund.

06:12.068 --> 06:12.635
Thanks.

06:12.635 --> 06:15.605
Now all I need is
20,000 more.

06:29.715 --> 06:31.817

I finish this row.

06:31.817 --> 06:34.419
So far, I've made
two scarves, a throw rug

06:34.419 --> 06:37.022
and well, whatever
this thing is.

06:37.022 --> 06:41.059
Why, Grandma,
what big eyes you have.

06:41.059 --> 06:43.462
The better to see
how ridiculous you look.

06:43.462 --> 06:46.631
Hilda's new obsession is doing
wonders for my wardrobe.

06:46.631 --> 06:48.066
How's my tube top coming?

06:48.066 --> 06:49.434
I'm on it.

Oh, hi, Mikey.

06:53.939 --> 06:55.207
Mikey?

06:55.207 --> 06:56.808
Yeah, it's a fun
nickname for Mike.

06:56.808 --> 06:58.510
Yeah, I got that.

06:58.510 --> 07:01.179
You get a chance to sharpen up
those ideas you were working on?

07:01.179 --> 07:02.981
Actually, I've been working on
sharpening my nails.

07:02.981 --> 07:05.884
Mm-hmm, well, come join us
at the conference table.

07:05.884 --> 07:06.651
I think you'll find

07:06.651 --> 07:08.820
my staff is a little
better at the whole

07:08.820 --> 07:10.922
"give the new kid
a break" thing.

07:10.922 --> 07:12.758
Oh, well, I don't need
a break yet

07:12.758 --> 07:14.226
but maybe after the meeting.

07:15.427 --> 07:16.428
Hi, Joshie.

07:16.428 --> 07:17.662
Joshie?

07:17.662 --> 07:19.731
Yeah, it's a fun
nickname for Josh.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.600
You're catching on.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.436
Folks, you all know
Sabrina, our intern.

07:24.436 --> 07:26.638
She's got some ideas
she wants to run by us.

07:26.638 --> 07:28.573
Be nice or you may
find something weird

07:28.573 --> 07:30.575
turning up in your coffee.

07:30.776 --> 07:34.679
So, Sabrina, college students
and their experiences.

07:34.679 --> 07:36.782
What are some of these ideas
you want to write about?

07:36.782 --> 07:41.052
Okey-dokey, well, um,
my first idea is...

07:41.052 --> 07:42.320
Guys.

07:42.518 --> 07:43.185
What about guys?

07:43.185 --> 07:46.488
Well, um, where are all
the cute guys on campus?

07:46.488 --> 07:47.156
I mean,
it seems like

07:47.156 --> 07:48.957
there are tons of girls
who want a cute boyfriend

07:48.957 --> 07:51.160
but there aren't enough
to go around.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.528
So, you want
to write a story

07:52.528 --> 07:54.563
about getting
a cute boyfriend?

07:54.563 --> 07:56.532
Well, not for me.
I already have one.

07:56.532 --> 07:57.232
Yeah, Joshie.

07:57.432 --> 07:59.868
And your second column
will be what?

07:59.868 --> 08:02.087
Ten ways to get
thinner thighs?

08:02.087 --> 08:03.221
Oh, I like it.

08:03.221 --> 08:04.688
Although, we should do
that one first

08:04.688 --> 08:07.590
because you'll never
get a cute boyfriend
with fat thighs.

08:07.590 --> 08:10.427
I think Sabrina's
just having fun with us.

08:10.427 --> 08:11.328
Come on, tell them about

08:11.328 --> 08:13.229
the story you want to write
on campus security.

08:13.229 --> 08:16.166
Oh, campus security
is a big problem.

08:16.166 --> 08:16.800
How so?

08:16.800 --> 08:18.234
Well, I know this girl Pam

08:18.234 --> 08:19.269
who's, like, so insecure

08:19.269 --> 08:21.771
and it's crazy because she has,
like, totally great hair.

08:21.771 --> 08:23.139
It's the color of my eyebrows.

08:23.139 --> 08:24.441
I'm sorry.

08:24.441 --> 08:26.276
What's the story about?

08:26.276 --> 08:27.978
Well, if Pam was more secure

08:27.978 --> 08:30.146
she could probably get herself
a cute guy.

08:30.513 --> 08:32.382
Should I start
writing now?

08:32.382 --> 08:33.817
Not just yet, no.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.218
Okey-dokey.

08:40.890 --> 08:42.425
Proud of me?

08:42.425 --> 08:43.626
Are you kidding?

08:43.626 --> 08:45.061
You just made
a fool of yourself

08:45.061 --> 08:46.363
and you made
a fool of me.

08:46.363 --> 08:48.865
Sabrina, I went out on a limb
to get you this job.

08:48.865 --> 08:50.600
'Cause I'm your girlfriend.

08:50.600 --> 08:51.768
What is wrong with you?

08:51.768 --> 08:52.669

08:52.669 --> 08:55.939
Am I crazy, or is there
wind coming through your ears?

08:55.939 --> 08:57.374
Oh, better than
from someplace else.

08:57.374 --> 08:59.109
( <i>giggling inanely</i> )

08:59.109 --> 09:00.777
I made a funny!

09:00.777 --> 09:02.145
Will you knock it off?

09:02.145 --> 09:04.247
This was your big shot
and you blew it.

09:04.247 --> 09:05.482
Now they're never going
to want you as a writer.

09:05.482 --> 09:07.550
You'll be lucky if
they keep you as an intern.

09:07.550 --> 09:09.185
Joshie, why are you
being such a grump?

09:09.185 --> 09:10.720
I mean, maybe they liked
the stuff I said.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.889
They hated it, all right?
I hated it.

09:12.889 --> 09:15.225
Well, I happen to think
I said some really cool stuff

09:15.225 --> 09:16.426
and if you don't
think it's cool

09:16.426 --> 09:17.360
then maybe I don't
think you're cool

09:17.360 --> 09:19.896
and if you're not cool
then maybe I don't
want to be with you.

09:19.896 --> 09:21.498
Are you breaking up with me?

09:21.498 --> 09:23.767
Okay, sure,
we're broken up, whatever.

09:23.767 --> 09:26.269
Hey, how do you think
I'd look with bangs?

09:26.269 --> 09:28.805
I don't care
how you'd look with bangs.

09:28.805 --> 09:30.106
That is so insensitive.

09:30.106 --> 09:31.441
No wonder we broke up.

09:31.441 --> 09:32.542
Buh-bye.

09:41.017 --> 09:42.018
Hey, guys.

09:42.018 --> 09:44.020
Oh, Sabrina,
Josh just stopped by.

09:44.020 --> 09:45.555
He's really worried
about you.

09:45.555 --> 09:48.058
He said something
about you going...

09:48.058 --> 09:49.057
What was it?

09:49.057 --> 09:50.325
Oh, yeah, insane.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.126
Ooh, Neiman's.

09:53.094 --> 09:55.163
Josh said you
broke up with him.

09:55.263 --> 09:56.631
Is he still going
on about that?

09:56.631 --> 09:57.966
That was hours ago.

09:57.966 --> 09:59.701
I love your boots.

09:59.701 --> 10:01.336
And I love your blouse.

10:01.336 --> 10:02.103
Thanks.

10:02.103 --> 10:04.405
It was either tiger print
or zebra.

10:04.405 --> 10:06.374
Harvey likes me better
in the tiger.

10:06.374 --> 10:07.575
( <i>roars</i> )

10:07.675 --> 10:10.211
Harvey, I never knew
you liked tiger.

10:10.211 --> 10:11.212
You know who I like?

10:11.212 --> 10:13.948
Tiger Woods. He's so cute.

10:13.948 --> 10:15.583
I wonder if he heard
that Josh and I broke up.

10:15.583 --> 10:16.918
I should call him.

10:16.918 --> 10:18.853
Sabrina, are you
all right?

10:18.853 --> 10:19.988
You don't seem
like yourself.

10:19.988 --> 10:22.123
I know. Isn't it great?

10:22.123 --> 10:24.125
You know, Morgan,
now that I think about it

10:24.125 --> 10:26.127
everyone is wearing
tiger this year.

10:26.127 --> 10:27.729
It's the hot seller
at Wal-Mart.

10:27.729 --> 10:29.297
Wal-Mart?

10:29.297 --> 10:30.298
Excuse me.

10:30.298 --> 10:33.401
I've got a large
animal print to return.

10:33.401 --> 10:35.069
I love Wal-Mart
and K-Mart.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.104
All the marts.

10:36.104 --> 10:37.305
Hey, let's go shopping!

10:37.305 --> 10:38.806
We're not going
anywhere.

10:38.806 --> 10:39.841
I just made up
that stuff

10:39.841 --> 10:41.242
so Morgan would leave.

10:41.242 --> 10:43.211
Oh, I get it.

10:43.211 --> 10:45.713
No, I don't.

10:45.713 --> 10:48.016
Sabrina, I'm no expert
on magic

10:48.016 --> 10:50.218
but it looks to me
like you're under a spell.

10:50.218 --> 10:51.152
Spell?

10:51.152 --> 10:52.854
You're a witch, remember?

10:52.854 --> 10:55.857
Oh, my gosh! You're right!

10:56.691 --> 10:58.960
Hey, I never have
to go shopping again.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.628
Do you want a car
or something?

11:00.628 --> 11:02.830
Sabrina, I think we need
to go for a little drive.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.066
Okay, then, car it is.

11:05.066 --> 11:06.768
I feel like a Porsche.

11:07.835 --> 11:08.936
I don't drive a stick.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.238
You do now.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.416
Oh, good lord.

11:21.416 --> 11:24.652
Hilda! Hilda, we need to talk!

11:24.652 --> 11:26.087
I'm right here.

11:26.087 --> 11:27.255
This has gone far enough.

11:27.255 --> 11:30.758
I demand that you stop
on behalf of sheep everywhere.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.560
What are you getting
so worked up about?

11:32.560 --> 11:34.695
Your new hobby has become
a pathology.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.164
You are addicted to knitting.

11:36.164 --> 11:38.633
Zelly, I knit because
it relaxes me.

11:38.633 --> 11:40.368
I can stop any time I want to.

11:40.368 --> 11:42.637
Look at you.
You are knitting alone.

11:42.637 --> 11:45.606
You're hiding balls of yarn
under yarn cozies.

11:45.606 --> 11:48.009
You've knitted yourself
into a woolen pod.

11:48.009 --> 11:49.343
You are a knit-aholic.

11:49.343 --> 11:51.345
A knit-phomaniac. A knitwit.

11:51.345 --> 11:52.780
Knitwit? That's cute.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.582
I'm going to knit that
on a pillow.

11:56.784 --> 11:57.885
Hi.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.588
Sabrina, Harvey,
what brings you here?

12:00.588 --> 12:02.623
Harvey's new car.
It's awesome.

12:02.623 --> 12:04.692
I think Sabrina's under
some kind of spell.

12:04.692 --> 12:05.993
She's acting really weird.

12:05.993 --> 12:07.028
Define "weird."

12:07.028 --> 12:09.063
There's only one way
to find out.

12:09.063 --> 12:11.599
Sabrina, dear,
put your finger on your nose

12:11.599 --> 12:15.002
balance on one foot
and say "ah."

12:17.939 --> 12:19.073
Ahhh!

12:19.073 --> 12:20.174
Interesting.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.676
Oh, Aunt Zelda, this game is
fun.

12:21.676 --> 12:25.113
Okay, um, touch your elbow,
put your leg behind your neck

12:25.113 --> 12:26.948
and say "Whee"!

12:26.948 --> 12:28.049
Harvey, I think
she may have

12:28.049 --> 12:29.584
some sort of
airhead virus.

12:29.584 --> 12:31.152
Hilda, what
do you think?

12:31.953 --> 12:35.022
Hilda, what
do you think!

12:35.022 --> 12:37.258
I'm sorry. I was knitting.

12:37.258 --> 12:41.062
Oh! Is it hot in here
or is it just me?

12:41.062 --> 12:43.531
I've never seen
Sabrina like this before.

12:43.531 --> 12:44.365
What are we going
to do?

12:44.365 --> 12:46.367
First thing we're going
to do is an intervention.

12:46.367 --> 12:48.336
Harvey, I may need a hand.

12:48.336 --> 12:49.737
Hilda, that's it.

12:49.737 --> 12:51.439
I'm taking away
your needles!

12:51.439 --> 12:52.106
Hey!

12:53.040 --> 12:55.143
Your niece is in trouble
and needs your help.

12:55.143 --> 12:57.145
Harvey, on the count
of three, pull.

12:57.145 --> 12:59.113
One, two

12:59.113 --> 13:00.648
three!

13:01.816 --> 13:04.986
Whoa! Guess I can skip
spinning class.

13:06.754 --> 13:08.689
Just as I feared.

13:08.689 --> 13:09.390
What is it?

13:09.390 --> 13:11.392
Sabrina's head is
completely empty.

13:11.392 --> 13:14.829
That airhead virus
must have drained her
of all her substance.

13:16.264 --> 13:18.633
This crossbreeze
is so refreshing.

13:18.633 --> 13:22.036
Sabrina, have you opened
any unusual emails lately?

13:22.036 --> 13:23.271
No, not really.

13:23.271 --> 13:26.240
Oh, well, there was this one
about a witch from Helsinki

13:26.240 --> 13:29.377
who did the strangest thing
with her pinkie.

13:29.844 --> 13:32.113
I didn't really understand it.

13:32.113 --> 13:34.815
I didn't get it at first,
either, but here's how I see it.

13:34.815 --> 13:38.619
Hilda, that email
was from theslammer.org

13:38.619 --> 13:40.421
the Other Realm prison.

13:40.454 --> 13:41.989
Why would someone
in the Other Realm prison

13:41.989 --> 13:43.591
want to hurt Sabrina?

13:43.591 --> 13:45.426
Who would be so evil?

13:47.094 --> 13:51.132
There once was a witch
from East Venus...

13:51.132 --> 13:52.667
Katrina, you evil thing.

13:52.667 --> 13:53.434
Thank you.

13:53.434 --> 13:54.835
How could you turn my niece

13:54.835 --> 13:55.536
into an idiot?

13:55.536 --> 13:57.838
I just hit enter. It was a snap.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.607
Well, you're not going
to get away with this.

13:59.607 --> 14:01.342
Oh, yeah? And who's going
to stop me?

14:01.342 --> 14:03.110
The smartest--
and according to many--

14:03.110 --> 14:06.314
most beautiful witch
in any realm.

14:06.314 --> 14:08.249
Somebody asking for me?

14:08.249 --> 14:09.483
Jezebelda

14:09.483 --> 14:12.587
I thought you would have worked
you way up to solitary by now.

14:12.587 --> 14:14.055
Stick around
a while longer.

14:14.055 --> 14:16.123
You'll be the reason
I get there.

14:16.123 --> 14:19.760
I'd love to trade threats,
but I'm here on urgent business.

14:19.760 --> 14:23.431
Katrina, I need the antidote
for that airhead virus.

14:23.998 --> 14:25.533
So that's the problem.

14:25.533 --> 14:27.902
You do seem a little more dumber
than last time.

14:27.902 --> 14:30.304
I am not more dumber.
Sabrina's more dumber.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.907
And there's no such
thing as more dumber.

14:33.808 --> 14:35.910
Well, guess what,
Brainiac.

14:35.910 --> 14:36.978
There is no antidote.

14:36.978 --> 14:38.312
Looks like you came
for nothing

14:38.312 --> 14:39.380
unless you want
to stay for lunch.

14:39.380 --> 14:40.815
It's taco Thursday.

14:40.815 --> 14:41.916
There's only one way

14:41.916 --> 14:43.818
to give Sabrina back
her substance.

14:43.818 --> 14:44.952
Don't tell her.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.320
I won't...

14:46.320 --> 14:48.322
unless she should
happen to zap me

14:48.322 --> 14:50.925
some of my very favorite
Mary Kay products.

14:50.925 --> 14:52.426
I'd just kill
for some lip liner.

14:52.426 --> 14:53.928
You already did.

14:54.161 --> 14:57.064
I hate bribes,
but this is an emergency.

14:57.999 --> 15:00.501
Oh, my favorite!

15:00.501 --> 15:02.970
Tallahassee Tope.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.472
You wouldn't
betray me

15:04.472 --> 15:05.873
Evil twins
stick together.

15:05.873 --> 15:06.707
No, they don't.

15:06.707 --> 15:08.943
They sell each
other out in
a heartbeat.

15:08.943 --> 15:11.279
If Sabrina wants
to get back her substance

15:11.279 --> 15:13.481
she has to relearn
all of life's lessons

15:13.481 --> 15:15.783
and she has to do it
by daybreak tomorrow

15:15.783 --> 15:18.386
or she'll be a pea brain
the rest of her born days.

15:18.386 --> 15:20.054
You cheap tramp!

15:20.054 --> 15:21.055
Not any more.

15:21.055 --> 15:23.491
I got me my Mary Kay
spring sampler.

15:23.491 --> 15:26.160
And I got me my antidote.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.261
I've got to get me out of here

15:27.261 --> 15:29.730
while my I.Q. still has
three digits.

15:29.730 --> 15:31.866
Well, actually, four.

15:34.835 --> 15:36.337
( <i>squeaking</i> )

15:37.004 --> 15:39.707
I knew this scarf
would come in handy someday.

15:40.308 --> 15:41.909
Okay, I've got
the antidote

15:41.909 --> 15:43.144
but we have
a lot of work to do.

15:43.144 --> 15:46.881
First, get that scarf
out of Sabrina's head.

15:47.548 --> 15:50.818
Second, we have
to play a little game.

15:50.818 --> 15:51.919
Oh, like the other game

15:51.919 --> 15:53.988
where I stand on one foot
and touch my nose?

15:53.988 --> 15:56.590
No. This game is called

15:56.590 --> 15:59.460
"We Put Everything You Used
to Know Back into Your Head

15:59.460 --> 16:01.796
"and You Commit it to Memory
and Then Apply it

16:01.796 --> 16:04.265
to Every Waking Moment
of Your Daily Life."

16:04.265 --> 16:05.466
Poo.

16:05.466 --> 16:06.667
Can't we play Kerplunk?

16:06.667 --> 16:08.235
Oh, I love Kerplunk.

16:08.736 --> 16:11.205
Kerplunk.

16:11.205 --> 16:13.007
That is not how
you play.

16:13.274 --> 16:15.810
Sabrina, in order
to be a person
of substance

16:15.810 --> 16:18.112
one must exercise
rational thought

16:18.112 --> 16:20.915
but never at the expense
of human emotion.

16:20.915 --> 16:24.051
Do I get to, like,
buy railroads
or something?

16:24.051 --> 16:25.953
Maybe we should start
with something simple.

16:25.953 --> 16:27.088
Do unto others

16:27.088 --> 16:29.423
as you would have them
do unto you.

16:29.590 --> 16:31.625
A penny saved is a penny earned.

16:31.625 --> 16:34.762
Don't eat yellow snow.

16:35.830 --> 16:36.364
What?

16:36.364 --> 16:39.433
To insure that our democracy
functions properly

16:39.433 --> 16:42.503
we need a system of
checks and...

16:42.503 --> 16:43.938
Credit cards.

16:43.938 --> 16:45.439
Checks and balances.

16:45.439 --> 16:46.440
Hey! Is that how they

16:46.440 --> 16:48.476
came up with "Balancing
your checkbook"?

16:48.476 --> 16:49.643
No.

16:49.643 --> 16:52.079
She's not even under a spell.

16:52.079 --> 16:54.081
Now, where were we?

16:54.081 --> 16:54.849
Talking about the government

16:54.849 --> 16:56.984
and our system of checks
and balances.

16:56.984 --> 16:59.754
Wow, something
actually made
it through.

16:59.754 --> 17:02.356
Excellent! It's time
to seize the moment.

17:02.356 --> 17:03.991
But first we eat.

17:03.991 --> 17:05.793
Dibs on the egg salad.

17:06.927 --> 17:08.162
Morgan, I don't get it.

17:08.162 --> 17:10.598
It's like Sabrina is
a completely different person.

17:10.598 --> 17:12.466
Don't look
a gift horse
in the mouth.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.335
Hey, I like
the Sabrina I knew.

17:14.335 --> 17:15.970
Well, maybe the
Sabrina you knew

17:15.970 --> 17:17.571
wasn't the real Sabrina.

17:17.571 --> 17:19.373
Maybe she needed time
to get comfortable

17:19.373 --> 17:21.976
with you before showing
her true self.

17:21.976 --> 17:23.611
Yeah, but how does a person
suddenly go

17:23.611 --> 17:25.913
from being intelligent
and thoughtful

17:25.913 --> 17:28.249
to being
a total airhead?

17:28.249 --> 17:29.784
She's not an airhead.

17:29.784 --> 17:33.287
She's just embracing the
material things in life

17:33.287 --> 17:35.656
which strikes me
as very healthy.

17:35.656 --> 17:38.392
So you're saying
the real Sabrina's
just like you?

17:39.160 --> 17:40.161
Just like me.

17:40.161 --> 17:41.829
Anything else I can get for you?

17:41.829 --> 17:43.030
A bucket?

17:44.832 --> 17:47.501
The Mesozoic Era was?

17:47.501 --> 17:50.604
The third era
of geological time

17:50.604 --> 17:53.774
including the Triassic,
Jurassic

17:53.774 --> 17:55.810
and Cretaceous periods.

17:55.810 --> 17:56.977
Excellent.

17:57.378 --> 17:58.446
The early bird...?

17:58.446 --> 17:59.480
Catches the worm?

17:59.480 --> 18:00.581
Chilly today...?

18:00.581 --> 18:01.682
Hot tamale.

18:01.682 --> 18:04.051
Sabrina, I think
you've got your
substance back.

18:04.051 --> 18:05.719
Now you just have to be
able to use it

18:05.719 --> 18:06.987
to get your
life in order.

18:06.987 --> 18:08.322
How are you
feeling, honey?

18:08.322 --> 18:10.591
Everything's starting
to make sense again.

18:10.591 --> 18:12.259
Except for one thing.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.161
Why is Salem
wearing a tube top?

18:14.161 --> 18:17.865
It provides support
where I need it most.

18:21.302 --> 18:22.570
Hey, thanks for
figuring out

18:22.570 --> 18:23.270
there was
something wrong

18:23.270 --> 18:24.271
and knowing where
to take me.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.207
I owe you one.

18:26.207 --> 18:28.242
How about zapping me
back my old car?

18:28.242 --> 18:29.243
I don't want Morgan
to like me

18:29.243 --> 18:32.446
for my Turbo Carrera.

18:32.446 --> 18:33.914
No problem.

18:33.948 --> 18:36.484
There, your
'86 Toyota Corolla.

18:36.484 --> 18:39.086
Think you could
pop out the dent?

18:39.086 --> 18:40.354
You got it.

18:44.758 --> 18:46.026
Hey, Josh, I'm glad
you're here.

18:46.026 --> 18:48.529
I'm sure you've been
wondering what's
going on with me.

18:48.529 --> 18:50.598
Me, me, me.
You know, Morgan's right.

18:50.598 --> 18:51.932
You are turning
into her.

18:51.932 --> 18:52.266
Josh!

18:52.266 --> 18:53.534
Hey, lover boy.

18:53.534 --> 18:55.202
We're getting started.
Front and center.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.471
How about a piece on vermin
in restaurants?

18:57.471 --> 18:58.572
I don't know.

18:58.572 --> 19:01.575
You see, one man's vermin
is another man's stir-fry.

19:01.575 --> 19:02.610
What else we got?

19:02.610 --> 19:04.311
Excuse me.
I don't mean
to interrupt

19:04.311 --> 19:06.046
but I have an idea
for a story.

19:06.046 --> 19:08.916
I don't know
how you could top
"Guys 'N Thighs."

19:08.916 --> 19:10.985
Look, I want to apologize
for my behavior yesterday.

19:10.985 --> 19:13.120
I had a really weird
virus that for some reason

19:13.120 --> 19:14.622
made me act like
a total airhead.

19:14.622 --> 19:16.891
And who would want
to publish stories
written by an airhead?

19:16.891 --> 19:17.625
We wouldn't.

19:17.625 --> 19:18.792
And you shouldn't.

19:18.792 --> 19:19.593
I just want you to know

19:19.593 --> 19:20.761
that the person you saw
yesterday

19:20.761 --> 19:21.829
wasn't the real me.

19:21.829 --> 19:23.197
I take my job very seriously

19:23.197 --> 19:24.532
and I appreciate
the opportunity

19:24.532 --> 19:26.000
to be around
professionals like you

19:26.000 --> 19:27.568
even if it's just
to get your coffee.

19:27.568 --> 19:29.537
Very well spoken.
I'll tell you what.

19:29.537 --> 19:31.505
If you can write half as well
as you can apologize

19:31.505 --> 19:33.707
there may be hope for you yet.

19:33.707 --> 19:35.809
Now what's this idea
you have?

19:35.809 --> 19:37.912
Well, it's not exactly
a college article

19:37.912 --> 19:39.680
but it's something
that's been on my mind.

19:39.680 --> 19:40.981
The three branches
of government:

19:40.981 --> 19:43.617
is our system
of checks and balances
really working?

19:43.617 --> 19:44.618
I love that.

19:44.618 --> 19:46.320
And if <i>U.S. News</i> hadn't
just done it

19:46.320 --> 19:49.390
I'm sure yours would
have been much better.

19:49.390 --> 19:51.959
I got to get myself
to a magazine rack.

19:58.599 --> 20:00.601
Hey.
Hey.

20:00.601 --> 20:01.802
That was quite a
little speech you made

20:01.802 --> 20:02.803
to the staff.

20:02.803 --> 20:05.172
Oh, well, I was hoping
one specific staff member

20:05.172 --> 20:07.141
would find it
in his heart
to forgive me.

20:07.141 --> 20:09.343
Yeah, Mike said
you're back on
his "A" list.

20:09.343 --> 20:10.578
You know what I mean.

20:10.578 --> 20:12.947
You do seem to be over
your princess phase.

20:12.947 --> 20:14.381
Josh, I'm sorry
I was so stupid.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.684
I never meant
to break up with you.

20:16.684 --> 20:18.786
Yeah, well,
I guess everybody
does stupid things

20:18.786 --> 20:20.120
now and then.

20:20.120 --> 20:21.255
Did I ever tell you
about the time

20:21.255 --> 20:23.090
I ordered sushi
at a truck stop?

20:23.090 --> 20:24.291
I was with you.
I drove you

20:24.291 --> 20:25.326
to the emergency room.

20:25.326 --> 20:27.595
Yeah, "real crab" my eye.

20:27.595 --> 20:28.896
Josh, can we forget
about the fish?

20:28.896 --> 20:30.664
I think you were
about to forgive me.

20:30.664 --> 20:31.665
I do forgive you.

20:31.665 --> 20:32.800
But, please, promise me

20:32.800 --> 20:34.668
if you ever get
one of these weird
viruses again

20:34.668 --> 20:35.636
you'll call in sick?

20:35.636 --> 20:36.570
I promise.

20:36.570 --> 20:38.606
Oh, one other thing.

20:38.606 --> 20:41.375
Never ever call
me "Joshie."

20:41.375 --> 20:43.877
That could be
a deal breaker.

20:45.179 --> 20:46.413
Or not.

20:52.086 --> 20:53.721
Well, needlepoint has
really helped me

20:53.721 --> 20:56.223
kick my knitting habit.
I don't miss it at all.

20:56.223 --> 21:00.628
I, on the other hand,
am still owed a codpiece.

21:00.628 --> 21:03.163
And I'm back to getting flooded
with annoying emails.

21:03.163 --> 21:05.165
But from now on,
I'm not going to respond.

21:05.165 --> 21:06.166
It's a good idea.

21:06.166 --> 21:07.368
You never know when
there might be

21:07.368 --> 21:09.069
an evil twin
on the other end.

21:09.069 --> 21:11.305
That's one thing
mortals don't have
to deal with.

21:11.305 --> 21:12.106
On the other hand

21:12.106 --> 21:15.576
they can't make
pudding on command.

21:15.576 --> 21:16.610
And they can't use magic

21:16.610 --> 21:18.112
to teach their evil twins
a lesson.

21:18.112 --> 21:19.179
I just sent Katrina

21:19.179 --> 21:21.215
a "Kill them with kindness"
spell.

21:21.215 --> 21:24.118
Jezebelda, you're
the smart one.

21:24.118 --> 21:25.352
You're the beautiful one.

21:25.352 --> 21:27.121
Ah, you are too kind.

21:27.121 --> 21:30.182
I know.
I'll get you for this, Sabrina.
