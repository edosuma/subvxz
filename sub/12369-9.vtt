WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:03.795
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:03.878 --> 00:05.797
IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.880 --> 00:08.048
- TO YOU.
- AND YOU.

00:08.132 --> 00:09.259
I'D GIVE YOU
A STANDING "O,"

00:09.342 --> 00:11.761
BUT WE ALREADY DID THAT
IN THE SHOWER.

00:11.845 --> 00:12.804
[knock on door]

00:12.887 --> 00:14.973
- EMMETT,
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.

00:15.056 --> 00:16.891
- OH, NO.
- WHO IS IT?

00:16.975 --> 00:17.934
- SHH, SHH, SHH,
SHH, SHH.

00:18.017 --> 00:19.602
SHE HAS BAT-LIKE HEARING.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.771
- I HEARD THAT.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.441
EMMETT,
WE NEED TO TALK.

00:24.524 --> 00:25.942
- EXCUSE ME,
BUT WHO ARE YOU

00:26.025 --> 00:27.444
TO BARGE INTO MY TRAILER?

00:27.527 --> 00:30.238
- I'M HIS WIFE.
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

00:40.540 --> 00:42.459
{\an8}- BUT YOU CAN'T BE
HIS WIFE.

00:42.542 --> 00:43.585
{\an8}FIVE YEARS AGO,

00:43.668 --> 00:45.128
{\an8}YOU TWO WERE ON THE COVER
OF <i> PEOPLE</i> MAGAZINE

00:45.211 --> 00:46.671
{\an8}WITH A BIG TEAR
DOWN THE MIDDLE.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.549
{\an8}IT DOESN'T GET MORE DIVORCE
THAN THAT.

00:49.632 --> 00:52.135
{\an8}- WE ARE DIVORCED,
IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.471
{\an8}EXCEPT...LEGALLY.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.680
{\an8}- WHAT?

00:55.764 --> 00:57.307
{\an8}- WE NEVER GOT AROUND
TO SIGNING THE PAPERS.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.101
{\an8}NIKKI, IF YOU'RE HERE,
YOU MUST WANT SOMETHING.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.311
{\an8}- I DO.

01:01.394 --> 01:02.645
{\an8}YOU KNOW
HOW I'VE BEEN TRYING

01:02.729 --> 01:03.772
{\an8}TO GET ON A REALITY SHOW?

01:03.855 --> 01:05.815
{\an8}WELL, I GOT A CALL
FROM THE PRODUCERS

01:05.899 --> 01:08.485
{\an8}OF <i> TRUE HOUSEWIVES</i>
<i>OF TAMPA/ST. PETE.</i>

01:08.568 --> 01:09.819
{\an8}- OOH.

01:09.903 --> 01:13.823
{\an8}OH, I LOVE
<i>T.H.O.T.S.P.</i>

01:16.409 --> 01:17.994
{\an8}I MEAN, WHAT DOES
THAT MINDLESS TRASH

01:18.077 --> 01:20.371
{\an8}HAVE TO DO WITH US?

01:20.455 --> 01:23.666
{\an8}- THEY WANT ME ON THE SHOW
AS EMMETT'S EX-WIFE.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.169
{\an8}- BUT TECHNICALLY,
YOU'RE NOT HIS EX-WIFE.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.837
{\an8}- IS SHE ALWAYS
THIS LITERAL?

01:27.921 --> 01:30.965
{\an8}THAT MUST GET OLD.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.801
{\an8}ANYWAY,
THEY'LL ONLY CAST ME

01:32.884 --> 01:34.302
{\an8}IF YOU AGREE TO DO
TWO APPEARANCES

01:34.385 --> 01:35.762
{\an8}AND AN ANGRY PHONE CALL
THAT INTERRUPTS ME

01:35.845 --> 01:37.931
{\an8}HELPING STACY THROUGH
HER BREAST IMPLANT EXPLOSION.

01:38.014 --> 01:39.557
{\an8}- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

01:39.641 --> 01:42.060
{\an8}- YOU KNOW
I'LL WEAR YOU DOWN.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.853
{\an8}- THAT MAY HAVE WORKED
WHEN WE WERE MARRIED,

01:43.937 --> 01:45.355
{\an8}BUT NOT ANY LONGER.

01:45.438 --> 01:47.398
- TECHNICALLY,
YOU ARE STILL MARRIED.

01:47.482 --> 01:51.444
- OH, JEEZ.
THIS ONE, LIKE A BROKEN RECORD.

01:54.113 --> 01:55.698
- IT'S JUST
SUCH A SHOCK.

01:55.782 --> 01:58.701
I TOLD EMMETT IT DIDN'T BOTHER
ME, BUT I'M DYING INSIDE.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.746
- YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT.
- THEN I'D HAVE TO SAY WHY.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.582
I'M UPSET BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THERE WAS A FUTURE FOR US,

02:04.666 --> 02:06.876
AND I THOUGHT
THAT HE FELT THE SAME.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.419
THEN HOW COULD HE FEEL
THE SAME

02:08.502 --> 02:10.964
IF HE'S KNOWN ALL ALONG
THAT HE WAS MARRIED?

02:11.047 --> 02:11.881
- THEN TALK TO HIM.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.217
PEOPLE SAY THAT COMMUNICATION
IS THE KEY

02:14.300 --> 02:15.468
TO ANY RELATIONSHIP.

02:15.552 --> 02:19.931
- PEOPLE DON'T SAY THAT.
WOMEN SAY THAT.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.058
LONELY WOMEN WHOSE BOYFRIENDS
HAVE LEFT THEM

02:22.141 --> 02:23.059
BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS WANT
TO TALK

02:23.143 --> 02:25.728
ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.439
OH, AND BESIDES, IT'S TOO SOON
TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.733
WE'VE ONLY KNOWN EACH OTHER
A FEW MONTHS.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.361
- DID HE SAY WHY HE HASN'T
SIGNED THE DIVORCE PAPERS?

02:33.444 --> 02:36.197
- HE SAID IT SLIPPED HIS MIND.
PLEASE.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.867
WHO FORGETS TO SIGN
THEIR DIVORCE PAPERS?

02:38.950 --> 02:41.744
- YOU AND JOY.

02:41.828 --> 02:47.250
AREN'T YOU TWO STILL
FAKE-GAY-CANADIAN MARRIED?

02:48.543 --> 02:50.169
- OH, GOD,
SHE'S RIGHT.

02:50.253 --> 02:53.590
- WAIT.
MAYBE THIS IS GOOD.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.592
THIS WAY I CAN BRING UP
THE SUBJECT

02:55.675 --> 02:57.427
AS SOMETHING
WE HAVE IN COMMON:

02:57.510 --> 02:58.595
THE NEED TO RID OURSELVES

02:58.678 --> 03:02.390
OF THE HIDEOUS WOMEN
WE MARRIED.

03:02.473 --> 03:05.143
NO OFFENSE, JOY.

03:05.226 --> 03:06.978
- I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO TAKE OFFENSE.

03:07.061 --> 03:08.938
I HAVE A BIOLOGY FINAL
TO GET TO,

03:09.022 --> 03:10.106
AND I'VE GOT
JUST ENOUGH TIME

03:10.189 --> 03:11.232
FOR ONE LAST TUTORING SESSION

03:11.316 --> 03:13.443
WITH DR. LLOYD.
- WHO'S THAT?

03:13.526 --> 03:15.111
- OH, HE'S THIS YOUNG RESIDENT
I'VE BEEN PAYING

03:15.194 --> 03:16.571
TO HELP ME STUDY.

03:16.654 --> 03:18.114
I DIDN'T TELL YOU
BECAUSE I WANTED YOU

03:18.197 --> 03:19.741
TO THINK I WAS SMART
ALL ON MY OWN.

03:19.824 --> 03:23.494
- OH, JOY.
WE WOULD NEVER THINK THAT.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.374
[doorbell rings]

03:29.709 --> 03:32.003
- OH,
IT'S THE ZAPPOS DELIVERY GUY.

03:32.086 --> 03:34.130
- YOU MEAN THE MAILMAN?

03:34.213 --> 03:36.925
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE TECHNICAL TERM IS.

03:37.008 --> 03:39.010
JUST LEAVE IT
ON THE PORCH.

03:39.093 --> 03:40.511
- VICTORIA,
ONE OF THE REASONS

03:40.595 --> 03:42.305
WE MOVED TO CLEVELAND
WAS TO GET TO KNOW PEOPLE.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.140
IT'S OKAY TO INTERACT.

03:44.223 --> 03:48.227
- I'M AN ACTOR, MELANIE,
NOT AN "INTERACTOR."

03:49.270 --> 03:51.314
- HI.
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

03:51.397 --> 03:52.857
HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?

03:52.941 --> 03:54.609
- IF YOU MUST KNOW,

03:54.692 --> 03:57.987
I'VE NEVER BEEN SADDER
IN MY LIFE.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.948
- OH, DEAR.
WHY?

04:00.031 --> 04:02.158
- MY WIFE OF 30 YEARS
LEFT ME TODAY.

04:02.241 --> 04:04.994
MY HEART IS BREAKING.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.537
- OH, I'M SO SORRY.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.331
WELL, IS THERE ANYTHING
WE CAN DO?

04:08.414 --> 04:10.875
- "WE"?

04:12.418 --> 04:15.171
- MAYBE A GLASS OF WATER.
- OF COURSE, COME ON IN.

04:15.254 --> 04:18.298
JUST HAVE A SEAT.
I'LL GET YOUR WATER.

04:18.382 --> 04:21.636
- A LITTLE ICE MAYBE.
- OF COURSE.

04:21.719 --> 04:24.514
- AND IF YOU HAVE
SOME LEMON PEEL,

04:24.597 --> 04:27.475
CURLICUE LIKE THE TAIL
OF THE PIG?

04:27.558 --> 04:29.060
- OH, I-I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT.

04:29.143 --> 04:30.144
HOW ABOUT A WEDGE?

04:30.228 --> 04:34.232
- THE CURLICUE
IS BETTER.

04:34.315 --> 04:37.443
- STARTING TO UNDERSTAND
WHY HIS WIFE LEFT HIM.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.489
YOU'VE GOT TO GET HIM
OUT OF HERE.

04:41.572 --> 04:44.158
- ELKA,
HIS WIFE JUST LEFT HIM.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.536
HELPING HIM OUT
IS THE NICE THING TO DO,

04:46.619 --> 04:47.996
THE CLEVELAND THING
TO DO.

04:48.079 --> 04:51.499
- WELL, EVEN IN CLEVELAND,
THERE'S A LINE.

04:51.582 --> 04:55.044
IT'S NOT LIKE DAYTON
WHERE ANYTHING GOES.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.754
- I'LL GIVE HIM
HIS GLASS OF WATER,

04:56.838 --> 04:57.839
AND THEN HE'LL LEAVE.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.590
- YOU'RE TOO MUCH
OF A MUSH.

04:59.674 --> 05:03.011
I'LL HANDLE IT.

05:05.638 --> 05:06.931
[indistinct mumbling]

05:07.015 --> 05:07.932
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:08.016 --> 05:11.561
- HE'S STAYING
FOR THE WEEKEND.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.271
- [whispers]
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LINE?

05:13.354 --> 05:17.734
- [whispers]
WELCOME TO DAYTON.

05:21.112 --> 05:23.698
- LLOYD,
I THINK I ACED MY TEST.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.033
ONE QUESTION:

05:25.116 --> 05:27.702
THE NUCLEOTIDE IN RNA
BUT NOT DNA--

05:27.785 --> 05:30.580
IT'S URACIL, RIGHT?
- IT IS <i> SO</i> URACIL.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.291
- YOU ARE
THE BEST TUTOR EVER!

05:33.374 --> 05:38.046
OH, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

05:43.009 --> 05:46.262
- BATHROOM'S FREE.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.805
- WHOSE ROBE IS THAT?

05:47.889 --> 05:50.308
- YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES YOU ORDER A ROBE

05:50.391 --> 05:52.935
FROM EDDIE BAUER,
AND IT DOESN'T COME?

05:53.019 --> 05:54.145
- YEAH.

05:54.228 --> 05:56.606
- IT ALWAYS COMES.

05:58.149 --> 06:00.610
- LISTEN, YE'ARJ.
- IT'S YE'ARJ.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.278
- YE'ARJ.
- YE'ARJ.

06:02.361 --> 06:03.404
- YE'ARJ.
- YE'ARJ.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.822
- YE'ARJ.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.574
- YOU'RE NOT LISTENING,
MELNEY.

06:06.657 --> 06:10.036
- MELANIE.
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

06:12.538 --> 06:16.084
- SO JUST LIKE YOU,
I TOO AM STILL LEGALLY MARRIED,

06:16.167 --> 06:18.252
ALBEIT IN CANADA.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.254
AND AS SOON
AS THE DIVORCE PAPERS GET HERE,

06:20.338 --> 06:23.674
FROM--
I WANT TO SAY UP NORTH,

06:23.758 --> 06:27.095
I AM GONNA BE SIGNING THEM
RIGHT AWAY.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.764
- GOOD FOR YOU,
VICTORIA.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.682
- OH, IT'S SURE GONNA FEEL GOOD
TO SIGN THOSE PAPERS.

06:31.766 --> 06:34.477
- BET IT WILL.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.479
VICTORIA, I'M NOT IN LOVE
WITH THIS SCENE

06:36.562 --> 06:37.480
WE'RE SHOOTING TODAY.

06:37.563 --> 06:38.940
I MEAN,
DO PEOPLE IN REAL LIFE

06:39.023 --> 06:41.692
JUST BURST INTO A ROOM
AND ANNOUNCE THEIR PLANS?

06:41.776 --> 06:45.113
- EMMETT,
I'M GONNA BLACKMAIL YOU.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.366
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
NIKKI?

06:48.449 --> 06:50.535
- YOU KNOW
THAT FAMOUS LOVEMAKING SCENE

06:50.618 --> 06:52.120
WITH EMMETT
AND SUSAN SARANDON?

06:52.203 --> 06:54.497
- OH, OF COURSE.
SO RAW, SO BRAVE.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.999
- SO FAKE.
HE USED A BODY DOUBLE.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.043
AND IF YOU DON'T AGREE
TO BE ON MY SHOW,

06:59.127 --> 07:00.920
I WILL TELL EVERYONE

07:01.003 --> 07:03.965
THAT THE FAMOUSLY TRUTHFUL
SIR EMMETT LAWSON IS A FRAUD.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.842
- YOU KNOW
I HAD NO CHOICE.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.344
I HAD TO GAIN 50 POUNDS
FOR A PREVIOUS ROLE,

07:08.427 --> 07:11.848
AND MY BACKSIDE
WAS STILL A LITTLE DOUGHY.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.018
- AND NOW
I HAVE MY PROOF.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.979
I RECORDED
THIS CONVERSATION.

07:18.062 --> 07:21.190
DAMN IT.
MY PHONE IS DEAD.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.025
STUPID BOYFRIEND.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.695
BRAD!

07:25.778 --> 07:27.363
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

07:27.446 --> 07:29.824
- WERE YOU PLAYING
<i>ANGRY BIRDS</i> AGAIN?

07:29.907 --> 07:32.660
- NO,<i> FRUIT NINJA.</i>

07:32.743 --> 07:36.205
- BRAD USED TO BE
OUR LIVE-IN TENNIS INSTRUCTOR.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.541
- I ALSO CLEANED THE POOLS
AND WALKED THE DOG.

07:38.624 --> 07:42.378
I'M KIND
OF A RENAISSANCE MAN.

07:46.924 --> 07:49.218
- HOW ABOUT
THE CATENA MALBEC?

07:49.302 --> 07:51.220
- MMM, SOUNDS LOVELY.
- GREAT.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.513
YOU'LL HAVE TO ORDER IT.

07:52.597 --> 07:53.764
- SORRY?

07:53.848 --> 07:57.393
- I CAN'T LEGALLY
SINCE I'M UNDER 21.

08:01.981 --> 08:05.568
- HOW...UNDER 21 ARE YOU?

08:05.651 --> 08:08.404
- 17.
- 17?

08:08.487 --> 08:10.615
- OH, WRONG, WRONG.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.408
SORRY, NOT 17.
18.

08:12.491 --> 08:16.704
I TURNED 18, LIKE, A WEEK AGO.
I KEEP FORGETTING.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.753
- 18?
YOU'RE ONLY 18?

08:23.836 --> 08:26.589
- I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL AT 11,
MED SCHOOL AT 16.

08:26.672 --> 08:29.091
- SO YOU'RE SOME SORT
OF DOOGIE HOWSER?

08:29.175 --> 08:32.053
- WHO?

08:32.135 --> 08:35.306
- YOU KNOW, THE TV SHOW
FROM THE EARLY '90s.

08:35.389 --> 08:38.100
BEFORE YOU WERE BORN.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.561
- JOY, AGE DOESN'T MATTER
TO ME.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.813
WHAT MATTERS IS THAT WE HAVE
A REAL CONNECTION.

08:42.897 --> 08:45.191
- SO SMOOTH AND UNLINED.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.151
HOW DID I MISS THAT?

08:47.235 --> 08:49.946
- I FINALLY WENT THROUGH
MY GROWTH SPURT LAST SUMMER.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.490
BEFORE THAT, I WAS ALL BABY FAT,
NO BODY HAIR.

08:52.573 --> 08:55.785
- OH, GOD.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.954
- JOY, I THINK WE HAVE
SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.248
AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT
BECAUSE YOU WERE MY FIRST.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.959
- FIRST?
FIRST WHAT?

09:03.042 --> 09:05.127
PLEASE SAY "ENGLISH WOMAN."

09:05.211 --> 09:06.629
- NOPE.

09:06.712 --> 09:10.007
- LLOYD,
THIS WAS A HUGE MISTAKE.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.009
MY HUGE MISTAKE.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.971
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE SO YOUNG.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.473
BUT NOW THAT I DO,
THIS CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

09:17.557 --> 09:22.144
AFTER ALL, I'M ALMOST...
TWICE YOUR AGE.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.813
IT'S JUST WRONG.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.315
YOU'RE A GENIUS.
I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND.

09:26.399 --> 09:30.361
- I LOVE YOU.

09:30.444 --> 09:34.824
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.829
- EVEN THOUGH
HE'S CLEARLY ANNOYED BY HER

09:39.912 --> 09:41.664
AND KICKED HER

MAYBE WE CAN FORM AN ALLIANCE.

IS IN THE AIR.

THAT CONVERSATION?

OUT OF THE PICTURE FOR GOOD.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.381

IF THEY'RE OFFICIALLY DIVORCED,

11:15.841 --> 11:17.259

19:31.837 --> 19:35.132
- OH, BUT IT'S ADDRESSED
TO THE THOMPSONS.

19:35.215 --> 19:38.302
- OH, YOU KNOW HOW SOMETIMES
YOU FORGET TO TIP THE MAILMAN,

19:38.385 --> 19:42.764
AND YOU THINK
IT DOESN'T MATTER?

19:42.848 --> 19:44.099
- YEAH.

19:44.182 --> 19:47.352
- IT ALWAYS MATTERS.
