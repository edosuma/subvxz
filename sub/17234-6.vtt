00:02.552 --> 00:04.203
<i>Previously on "Nashville"...</i>

00:04.204 --> 00:05.775
I'm not doing a comeback album.

00:05.776 --> 00:07.834
You'll get my buyout paperwork next week.

00:07.835 --> 00:10.431
That song is special.

00:10.432 --> 00:12.664
I wrote it for you.

00:12.665 --> 00:14.736
Come out on the road. You
can be the music director.

00:14.737 --> 00:16.618
I can't. It hurts too
much being around music

00:16.619 --> 00:17.914
if I can't play it.

00:17.915 --> 00:19.147
I always loved that one.

00:19.148 --> 00:20.524
Him or the song?

00:20.525 --> 00:21.682
I am happy to be here,

00:21.683 --> 00:23.336
that you and me are gonna
do big things together.

00:23.337 --> 00:24.865
You're under arrest for racketeering.

00:24.866 --> 00:26.092
You have the right to talk to an attorney

00:26.093 --> 00:27.687
before you answer any questions.

00:27.688 --> 00:29.239
(Glenn) The Wentworth family, huh?

00:29.240 --> 00:30.946
Private one-night only concert.

00:34.905 --> 00:38.486
Rayna, after surviving a
near-fatal car accident,

00:38.940 --> 00:41.644
fighting your way back
from the brink of death,

00:41.645 --> 00:44.667
how did it feel to learn
about your father's arrest

00:44.668 --> 00:46.365
on the very day

00:46.366 --> 00:47.896
that you made, by all accounts,

00:47.897 --> 00:50.198
a triumphant return to the stage?

00:50.199 --> 00:53.727
It was... completely
shocking and upsetting.

00:53.728 --> 00:55.011
Well, that's understandable.

00:55.012 --> 00:58.583
These are serious charges...
Extortion, racketeering.

00:58.584 --> 01:01.928
Do any of these... allegations reconcile

01:01.929 --> 01:03.832
with the man who raised you?

01:03.833 --> 01:06.828
I like to think that my
father is an ethical man.

01:06.829 --> 01:10.032
Uh, he always kept his
business dealings very separate,

01:10.033 --> 01:11.284
and I also like to think that

01:11.285 --> 01:13.981
innocent till proven guilty
means something, so...

01:13.982 --> 01:16.453
Well, we all know it's been
a difficult year for you,

01:16.454 --> 01:19.392
and your fans... they just
wanna know how you're holding up.

01:19.393 --> 01:23.058
I'm doing great. I-I
really... I really am,

01:23.059 --> 01:25.131
and... and, you know, you go
through something like that,

01:25.132 --> 01:26.956
- and I know you know.
- Yeah.

01:26.957 --> 01:28.653
It gives you a new perspective,

01:28.654 --> 01:30.664
and I am just focusing on the things

01:30.665 --> 01:33.718
that are important to
me... My girls, my music.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.699
Yeah, you're a mom, a recording artist.

01:35.700 --> 01:38.684
Yes, I-I have a new
label... Highway 65 Records.

01:38.685 --> 01:42.254
In fact, uh, my first
artist is here with me today.

01:42.255 --> 01:44.174
- Scarlett o'Connor's right over there.
- (Robin laughs) Mm-hmm.

01:44.175 --> 01:45.468
Wait until you hear her sing.

01:45.469 --> 01:47.995
Well, you are keeping mighty busy
these days.

01:47.996 --> 01:49.724
- Mm-hmm.
- So it begs the question...

01:50.098 --> 01:52.061
Do you have any time for romance?

01:52.394 --> 01:54.214
No comment. (Laughs)

Said the tone-deaf lawyer.

02:38.747 --> 02:40.069
(Chuckles)

02:40.415 --> 02:43.884
(Sighs) Is that easier
to play than the guitar?

02:43.885 --> 02:46.170
(Mug clatters) The way I play it, it is.

02:48.833 --> 02:50.506
What are you doing tomorrow?

02:50.507 --> 02:54.004
(Sighs) Same thing I'm doing today. Why?

02:54.674 --> 02:56.794
Because my firm is co-sponsoring

02:56.795 --> 02:59.155
the Belle Meade invitational polo match.

02:59.662 --> 03:01.962
Oh. That sounds great,
but I got a... root canal

03:02.269 --> 03:04.216
I was gonna schedule,
so I'll probably do that.

03:04.217 --> 03:05.843
Come on. Don't be a reverse snob.

03:05.844 --> 03:06.911
(Laughs) Is that what I'm doing?

03:06.912 --> 03:08.284
- Yes.
- Oh.

03:08.285 --> 03:10.335
It's for work. I can't not go.

03:10.336 --> 03:13.901
Ah, see that's the thing.
I can not go,

03:13.902 --> 03:16.322
so I'm probably gonna... Not go.

03:16.323 --> 03:19.120
Okay. Never mind. I'll ask somebody else.

03:21.582 --> 03:23.478
<i>Is there somebody else?</i>

03:23.479 --> 03:25.144
Do you care if there is?

03:26.549 --> 03:27.777
No.

03:27.778 --> 03:29.346
Me neither.

03:35.506 --> 03:36.886
(Bucky) You covered all the bases.

03:36.887 --> 03:39.457
I think I might need some
lessons from you. (Chuckles)

03:39.458 --> 03:41.226
Honey, you're gonna do just fine.

03:41.626 --> 03:43.436
And don't you let somebody like Jeff

03:43.437 --> 03:44.935
get under your skin.

03:44.936 --> 03:46.927
He had no right to do that to you.

03:46.928 --> 03:48.875
Besides, you're with me, not with him.

03:48.876 --> 03:50.979
Thank you. That makes me feel a lot better.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.550
Well, listen, you got your
whole life ahead of you

03:53.551 --> 03:55.554
to figure it out, and I'm excited.

03:55.555 --> 03:57.893
I'm more excited than ever.
We're gonna get you out there,

03:57.894 --> 03:59.967
get you out in front of
the Nashville tastemakers.

03:59.968 --> 04:01.706
Yeah, and we got you booked
as a featured performer

04:01.707 --> 04:03.209
tomorrow night at the Bluebird.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.038
You know, we need to get
people talking about you,

04:05.039 --> 04:06.470
get you reviewed.

04:06.471 --> 04:07.980
Does that mean there'll be critics there?

04:07.981 --> 04:10.872
Oh, yeah. We wanna kinda create some buzz,

04:10.873 --> 04:13.881
get you a fanbase before you
even step into the studio.

04:13.882 --> 04:16.192
- Okay.
- The other thing we're working on...

04:16.192 --> 04:18.341
We wanna get you booked as an opener

04:18.341 --> 04:21.052
for one of the big tours
that's out there right now.

04:21.053 --> 04:22.692
That'd be really great for
you. (Cell phone buzzes)

04:22.693 --> 04:24.575
It's Jeff again.

04:24.576 --> 04:25.528
Ugh.

04:25.529 --> 04:27.091
- Okay, I gotta go.
- Okay.

04:27.092 --> 04:28.608
Thank you so much for
today. That was really cool.

04:28.609 --> 04:30.263
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

04:30.264 --> 04:31.462
- Can't wait.
- Okay. (Giggles)

04:31.463 --> 04:32.936
(Bucky) See you.

04:34.072 --> 04:35.180
What does he want?

04:35.181 --> 04:37.595
He wants to know when he's gonna
get your buyout offer. (Door opens)

04:37.596 --> 04:39.286
(Inhales sharply) (Door closes)

04:39.287 --> 04:40.352
Well...

04:40.353 --> 04:42.231
Guess my plans for that
have changed a little bit

04:42.232 --> 04:44.989
since my father's assets have been frozen.

04:44.990 --> 04:46.168
What should I tell him?

04:46.169 --> 04:47.981
Tell him he'll get it when he gets it.

04:47.982 --> 04:49.769
Are you having any luck with this tour?

04:49.770 --> 04:51.197
- Mm.
- I think that's really the way to go.

04:51.198 --> 04:52.525
I called everybody I can think of.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.331
I'm getting "nos" across the board.

04:54.332 --> 04:56.211
Scarlett's still such an unknown quantity.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.436
No one wants to take a chance,
not even as a pre-opener.

04:58.437 --> 05:00.044
Do you wanna hear the
worst idea in the world?

05:00.045 --> 05:01.126
Sure.

05:01.127 --> 05:02.217
Juliette Barnes.

05:02.218 --> 05:04.995
(Laughs) Wow. You wanna go there?

05:05.683 --> 05:06.917
Scarlett would learn a lot,

05:07.569 --> 05:08.759
and, you know,

05:08.760 --> 05:11.843
Juliette's got a sold-out
tour, and she knows Scarlett.

05:13.789 --> 05:15.608
(Glenn) The promoters want to
add another night in Houston.

05:15.967 --> 05:18.018
Oh, great. Tell them yes.

05:18.593 --> 05:20.325
And this just arrived by messenger.

05:21.703 --> 05:23.072
"You are cordially invited

05:23.073 --> 05:26.363
<i>to the Belle Meade
invitational polo match."</i>

05:27.877 --> 05:28.971
Huh.

05:28.972 --> 05:31.201
Society types don't usually like my kind.

05:31.202 --> 05:32.650
It's probably a mistake.

05:32.651 --> 05:34.564
No, no, no. This address is handwritten.

05:34.565 --> 05:35.993
No mistake here.

05:36.379 --> 05:38.479
I guess I've finally arrived.

05:38.856 --> 05:39.881
You going?

05:40.423 --> 05:42.870
If Nashville's old money
wants to rub elbows with me...

05:43.451 --> 05:44.774
Who am I to deny them?

05:44.775 --> 05:46.224
(Chuckles)

05:46.623 --> 05:48.164
(Footsteps depart)

05:49.978 --> 05:52.363
What do you wear to a polo match?

05:53.021 --> 05:54.470
(Amplified voice) And by capitalizing...

05:54.471 --> 05:57.390
(Camera shutters clicking) On both
superstars and up-and-coming talent,

05:57.391 --> 05:59.232
my new music city music festival

05:59.233 --> 06:00.462
will help position Nashville

06:00.463 --> 06:03.082
as one of America's
premiere destination cities.

06:03.083 --> 06:04.585
Questions?
(Reporters shouting questions at once)

06:04.586 --> 06:07.878
Your long time supporter, Lamar Wyatt...
He's been charged with racketeering

06:07.879 --> 06:09.607
along with many other charges.

06:09.608 --> 06:12.253
Do you have any knowledge
of his alleged wrongdoing?

06:12.254 --> 06:14.045
I'm really not at liberty to comment

06:14.046 --> 06:16.277
on an ongoing investigation,
but I can say...

06:16.655 --> 06:18.287
That the fund-raising for my campaign

06:18.288 --> 06:20.128
was absolutely by the book.

06:20.129 --> 06:22.915
- But he's your father-in-law. Surely...
- Ex father-in-law.

06:23.297 --> 06:25.068
And my first order of business as mayor

06:25.069 --> 06:27.121
was severing ties with
him and Wyatt Industries

06:27.122 --> 06:28.819
and focusing on the future of Nashville.

06:28.820 --> 06:31.547
Speaking of the future, you
haven't publicly commented

06:31.548 --> 06:33.640
about your upcoming
wedding with Peggy Kenter.

06:34.163 --> 06:35.168
Just a few months ago,

06:35.169 --> 06:37.566
you were denying any relationship with her.

06:37.567 --> 06:38.635
What happened?

06:38.636 --> 06:40.979
Well, thank you for asking
about my happy personal news.

06:41.316 --> 06:43.569
Ms. Kenter and I are going
to be married next week

06:43.570 --> 06:45.127
in a private ceremony.

06:45.428 --> 06:47.901
Uh, we've been longtime
friends and colleagues.

06:47.902 --> 06:49.794
We became involved well after my divorce.

06:50.414 --> 06:52.643
And I hope that you show her the respect

06:52.644 --> 06:54.861
this city's first lady deserves.

06:55.437 --> 06:58.043
Now, let's get back to questions
about the music festival.

06:58.044 --> 06:59.493
(Reporters resume shouting at once)
Next.

07:02.974 --> 07:04.287
<i>(Music playing)</i>

07:04.288 --> 07:05.362
<i>* Oh, baby *</i>

07:05.363 --> 07:06.614
<i>* That's what *</i>

07:06.941 --> 07:08.969
<i>* I do *</i>

07:11.068 --> 07:12.834
<i>* That's what *</i>

07:13.423 --> 07:15.685
<i>* I do *</i>

07:16.545 --> 07:17.853
(Song ends)

07:20.059 --> 07:21.397
(Taps key)

07:21.398 --> 07:23.198
It sounds great. (Chuckles)

07:23.199 --> 07:25.164
It helps to have a
multimillion dollar studio

07:25.165 --> 07:26.386
at your fingertips.

07:26.387 --> 07:28.280
Yes, thank you, Juliette Barnes.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.697
Who woulda thunk it, huh?

07:30.698 --> 07:32.383
You and me...

07:32.384 --> 07:34.670
- What, making beautiful music together?
- (Sighs)

07:35.201 --> 07:37.582
You know, you and Zoey
work well together, too.

07:38.318 --> 07:40.389
You know, we just all had a
great time the other night,

07:40.390 --> 07:42.016
- and her voice sounds great.
- (Chuckles)

07:42.352 --> 07:44.544
I was thinking of bringing
her in on this one, too.

07:44.545 --> 07:45.883
(Inhales sharply) Yeah, you know, I was...

07:45.884 --> 07:48.546
I was thinking that was more a-a one-time
thing. (Knock on door, door opens)

07:48.547 --> 07:51.586
- (Chuckles) You know, we barely know each other.
- Oh! Hi, um...

07:51.587 --> 07:53.175
(Dog barking in distance)

07:53.176 --> 07:55.330
- I must be early. I'm sorry.
- Uh, no, we, uh...

07:55.646 --> 07:56.890
We ran long.
(Door closes)

07:57.344 --> 08:00.882
Yeah, I'm gonna, uh, get outta here.

08:01.196 --> 08:02.870
(Chuckles) Um...

08:02.871 --> 08:03.956
Thanks, man.

08:05.700 --> 08:07.511
- Uh, see ya.
- Bye.

08:08.823 --> 08:10.222
(Door opens)

08:11.206 --> 08:12.390
(Dog barking in distance, door closes)

08:12.391 --> 08:13.851
That was weird and unexpected.

08:13.852 --> 08:16.414
You know, don't worry. We only
talked about you a little bit.

08:16.415 --> 08:19.937
(Chuckles) Are you guys
working on something together?

08:19.938 --> 08:21.594
Yeah. Recorded a song.

08:21.595 --> 08:23.911
I'm kinda gettin' into
this whole producing thing.

08:23.912 --> 08:25.320
(Sighs) What's going on?

08:25.321 --> 08:27.940
You sounded kinda rattled on the phone.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.558
Not much. Uh, except... (Chuckles)

08:30.865 --> 08:33.323
Rayna's got me playing
at the Bluebird tonight

08:33.325 --> 08:34.448
for a bunch of critics,

08:34.448 --> 08:36.751
and then she's talking
about going on tour...

08:36.751 --> 08:38.135
Pretty soon after that.

08:38.136 --> 08:40.693
And there's a lot going on,
and I don't wanna blow it.

08:40.695 --> 08:42.061
And I thought if there was anybody

08:42.383 --> 08:43.817
I could talk to about it,

08:44.476 --> 08:46.546
it would be you.

08:48.895 --> 08:51.384
I'm glad to be of service. (Chuckles)

08:53.024 --> 08:55.456
<i>Lamar Wyatt pleaded not guilty to charges</i>

08:55.457 --> 08:57.533
<i>of bribery, extortion, and racketeering</i>

08:58.985 --> 09:01.414
<i>A bail hearing has not
been scheduled as yet,</i>

09:01.415 --> 09:03.012
<i>- but prosecutors maintain...</i>
- Thank you.

09:03.013 --> 09:04.688
<i>Mr. Wyatt poses a... (Turns TV off)</i>

09:05.041 --> 09:06.450
(Groans) (Remote clatters)

09:06.451 --> 09:07.791
And I asked him for a loan.

09:09.154 --> 09:10.364
You know, I really...

09:10.365 --> 09:12.111
I'd like to think he's innocent, but...

09:12.622 --> 09:14.123
Why doesn't this surprise me?

09:15.654 --> 09:18.169
I still can't stand the idea
of him being in jail, though.

09:18.480 --> 09:19.709
I know.

09:21.039 --> 09:23.228
Aren't you glad you didn't
take one dime from him?

09:23.229 --> 09:26.180
Although I did tell Jeff
Fordham to kiss my ass.

09:26.575 --> 09:28.744
That was a little bit premature.

09:28.745 --> 09:32.267
However, I am still
leaving Edgehill, period.

09:32.268 --> 09:34.784
So I just have to find
funding somewhere else.

09:34.785 --> 09:36.836
Well, the one thing I know
about building a business

09:37.186 --> 09:38.629
is that you have to be passionate

09:38.630 --> 09:39.989
about what you're doing...

09:40.546 --> 09:42.710
And you have to talk to the right people.

09:43.437 --> 09:45.653
Okay, I wasn't gonna go
to this... (Sets down mug)

09:45.654 --> 09:47.529
Because of everything
that happened to daddy,

09:47.530 --> 09:50.897
but today... Is the Belle Meade polo match.

09:50.898 --> 09:53.747
Oh, honey. I have lived my entire life

09:54.077 --> 09:56.873
never having set foot on a polo field...

09:56.874 --> 09:58.433
This is business.

09:58.434 --> 10:00.148
Those are exactly the type of people

10:00.149 --> 10:02.117
who have disposable incomes

10:02.118 --> 10:03.921
that they can invest in the arts.

10:03.922 --> 10:05.634
Those are the people you need to talk to.

10:05.635 --> 10:06.950
Mnh... mnh-mnh.

10:06.951 --> 10:09.506
You know you love big hat events.

10:09.507 --> 10:12.009
(Jazz music playing, laughter)

10:12.010 --> 10:13.916
(Horse whinnies)

10:17.012 --> 10:18.478
(Indistinct conversations)

10:18.790 --> 10:21.498
I hate these big hat events.
Is it too late to go home?

10:21.499 --> 10:22.385
Yes.

10:22.386 --> 10:23.799
- (Woman) Rayna!
- Hey!

10:23.800 --> 10:27.023
- It's been much too long.
- Yes, Myrna and Patty, great to see you both.

10:27.024 --> 10:28.386
- You, too.
- Can we get a quick photo

10:28.387 --> 10:30.052
with the queen of country music?

10:30.053 --> 10:32.770
- Oh, sure.
- Oh, Tandy, would you be a dear?

10:32.771 --> 10:34.585
- Oh! Love to.
- She would love to.

10:34.586 --> 10:37.182
All right, ladies... Ready?

10:37.183 --> 10:38.570
Smile! (Camera shutter clicks)

10:38.902 --> 10:40.462
There you go. Lovely!

10:40.463 --> 10:41.874
- (Man) Can I have your autograph, please?
- Oh!

10:42.184 --> 10:44.016
- Hi. How are you?
- Rayna, we're gonna leave you to it.

10:44.017 --> 10:45.675
Oh, okay. I have something I
want to talk to y'all about.

10:45.676 --> 10:47.434
So I'm gonna holler at
you later, all right?

10:47.435 --> 10:48.711
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:48.712 --> 10:50.033
- Thank you so much.
- Bye.

10:50.034 --> 10:51.297
(Horse whinnies) Well, it's a good thing

10:51.298 --> 10:53.480
daddy's arrest hasn't
affected your star appeal.

10:54.517 --> 10:55.562
Well, most of these people know

10:55.563 --> 10:57.058
that we've been estranged for a long time.

10:57.059 --> 10:58.583
- (Man) Hey, Rayna.
- Well, that's a good thing, because

10:58.584 --> 11:00.886
he's got
a lot of friends and a lot of enemies...

11:00.887 --> 11:02.811
And they're all here today.

11:02.812 --> 11:04.116
Well, as long as some of them would like

11:04.117 --> 11:05.677
to get involved in the music business,

11:06.119 --> 11:08.597
'cause otherwise what the
hell else am I doing here?

11:08.598 --> 11:09.911
- Hmm.
- Oh, hello!

11:09.912 --> 11:11.564
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

11:12.782 --> 11:14.405
(Horse whinnies) What the
hell is she doing here?

11:14.406 --> 11:15.597
(Juliette) Thank you.

11:15.598 --> 11:17.765
Oh, my gosh! Juliette Barnes.

11:17.766 --> 11:19.227
I'm Sunny Winston. (Chuckles)

11:19.228 --> 11:20.905
I had no idea you were coming this year.

11:20.906 --> 11:22.607
I managed to fit it in.

11:22.608 --> 11:23.835
- I'm a huge fan.
- (Chuckles) Oh.

11:23.836 --> 11:25.020
I just love that you're here.

11:25.021 --> 11:26.400
And I love that you're here, too.

11:27.110 --> 11:28.160
Charlie.

11:29.088 --> 11:30.507
What a surprise.

11:30.906 --> 11:32.126
You guys are friends?

11:32.612 --> 11:34.431
That might just be the
best thing ever. (Chuckles)

11:34.432 --> 11:35.854
Oh, yeah, we go way back.

11:35.855 --> 11:38.275
I sang at Charlie and Olivia's anniversary.

11:38.276 --> 11:39.744
(Sunny) Of course you did.

11:39.745 --> 11:41.326
"People" magazine voted "Charlivia"

11:41.327 --> 11:43.116
the world's most interesting couple.

11:43.117 --> 11:45.775
Wow, well, they are interesting, indeed.

11:45.776 --> 11:47.154
Very nice to meet you. (Chuckles)

11:49.884 --> 11:51.124
(Lowered voice) What are you doing here?

11:51.125 --> 11:52.685
(Lowered voice) The outfit
doesn't give it away?

11:52.686 --> 11:53.781
I'm playing.

11:53.782 --> 11:55.098
I'm just glad that you made it.

11:55.998 --> 11:57.385
You sent me the invite?

11:57.386 --> 12:00.143
- Of course.
- What is wrong with you?

12:00.144 --> 12:01.916
Oh, my gosh! Juliette!

12:02.998 --> 12:04.703
- You're here!
- Olivia!

12:04.704 --> 12:06.134
- Hi!
- Wow!

12:06.135 --> 12:09.074
Oh! I did not expect to
see either one of you here.

12:09.075 --> 12:10.559
Well, I'm a good, supportive wife,

12:10.560 --> 12:12.065
here to cheer my husband on.

12:12.891 --> 12:15.330
You know what? I don't know anyone here.

12:15.331 --> 12:16.985
Come hang out. We are just...

12:16.986 --> 12:18.671
- (Chuckles) Gonna have so much fun together.
- Okay.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.156

(Indistinct conversations)

12:49.907 --> 12:51.466
(Jazz music playing)

12:55.385 --> 12:57.015
Thought you had a root canal.

12:57.016 --> 12:58.413
I thought you were bringing somebody else.

12:58.414 --> 13:00.124
(Chuckles) How do you know I didn't?

13:00.125 --> 13:01.812
Well, I figured you figured I'd show.

13:02.440 --> 13:03.709
Hope you don't mind going to dinner

13:03.710 --> 13:05.530
with some of the firm's partners after.

13:05.531 --> 13:07.833
All right, but no snails or
Sushi or any of that stuff.

13:08.140 --> 13:09.225
Okay.

13:09.916 --> 13:11.219
(Speaking inaudibly)

13:13.635 --> 13:15.314
Surprised to see her, that's all.

13:15.315 --> 13:16.979
She usually hates this kind of thing.

13:17.284 --> 13:18.543
Did I say anything?

13:20.842 --> 13:21.562
- No.
- Hmm.

13:21.563 --> 13:22.709
No, you didn't.

13:22.710 --> 13:23.906
(Horses galloping)

13:24.331 --> 13:26.306
And Scarlett's about to go out on tour.

13:26.307 --> 13:27.974
We're just really excited about it.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.379
Uh, you know, I want to
find the perfect partners

13:30.380 --> 13:33.879
to make Highway 65 the
best label, you know?

13:34.204 --> 13:35.438
It'd be fun to go out to dinner sometime.

13:35.439 --> 13:36.588
We could chat about it.

13:36.589 --> 13:38.960
Oh, Rayna, business just
makes my head spin...

13:38.961 --> 13:40.731
And not in a good way.
(Chuckles) (Chuckles)

13:41.346 --> 13:42.504
I think I need a refill.

13:42.912 --> 13:45.910
Of course... Patty.

13:45.911 --> 13:47.219
- Hey
- Oh, hey!

13:47.781 --> 13:51.603
- How are you?
- I've been trying to catch your eye for some time,

13:51.604 --> 13:53.642
- but you got a lot of admirers.
- Oh, yeah, well...

13:53.643 --> 13:55.304
A lot of old acquaintances around here.

13:55.305 --> 13:56.232
What are you doing here?

13:56.233 --> 13:57.994
I would not have pegged
you for the polo type.

13:57.995 --> 14:00.550
Horses. I got two of 'em playing today.

14:00.551 --> 14:01.966
- Ohh.
- But I'm new to the sport.

14:01.967 --> 14:03.254
Must be old hat for you...

14:03.255 --> 14:04.838
Fourth generation belle Meade and all.

14:04.839 --> 14:07.311
(Chuckles) C.M.A. Special
I saw a few years back.

14:07.312 --> 14:08.291
Oh, is that right?

14:08.292 --> 14:09.334
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

14:09.335 --> 14:10.635
Yeah, well, this is where I'm from.

14:10.636 --> 14:12.604
It's not exactly my world,
if you know what I mean.

14:12.605 --> 14:13.261
Mm-hmm.

14:15.045 --> 14:16.736
The country club set's
sure gettin' their fill

14:16.737 --> 14:18.212
of music types today, huh?

14:18.787 --> 14:20.154
They sure are.

14:20.992 --> 14:22.173
(Indistinct conversations)

14:22.174 --> 14:24.076
I ever tell you what
happened with Dominic? (Sighs)

14:24.686 --> 14:26.310
I know you burned your masters.

14:27.780 --> 14:28.899
It's a small town.

14:28.900 --> 14:30.218
Word travels fast.

14:30.219 --> 14:32.408
(Chuckles) That was a rookie move.

14:33.727 --> 14:35.292
Thought I knew better.

14:36.121 --> 14:40.032
I guess I blew a lot of
good things last year.

14:40.911 --> 14:42.478
Maybe they weren't meant to be.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.413
I just...

14:44.414 --> 14:47.273
I just wasn't mature
enough to handle what I had.

14:48.181 --> 14:49.373
And if...

14:49.675 --> 14:51.487
If I did get another chance,

14:53.106 --> 14:54.416
I'd do it differently.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.989
What are you doing slingin'
beer at the Bluebird?

15:00.990 --> 15:02.858
Isn't Juliette going
out on tour again soon?

15:02.859 --> 15:04.677
Yeah, we're still friends.

15:05.009 --> 15:06.089
But...

15:07.046 --> 15:09.123
To be honest, I think
I'd rather be a barback

15:09.124 --> 15:10.756
and make my own music than...

15:12.044 --> 15:14.466
Wear golden handcuffs, you know?

15:15.185 --> 15:16.197
Yeah.

15:18.511 --> 15:20.678
Quite a lovely city you've
got here... Nashville.

15:21.032 --> 15:22.497
I can't believe I've not been here before.

15:22.933 --> 15:23.987
It is hard to believe,

15:23.988 --> 15:26.013
given your ownership of
several local radio stations.

15:26.567 --> 15:28.056
Yeah, they're all, uh,

15:28.057 --> 15:29.871
held under one of my media subgroups.

15:29.872 --> 15:31.057
Though my C.O.O. Tells me

15:31.058 --> 15:33.289
these Nashville stations
are top performers.

15:33.290 --> 15:34.709
Well, then you may be interested in hearing

15:34.710 --> 15:36.197
about a music festival I'm putting together

15:36.198 --> 15:38.275
- for the city.
- Definitely.

15:39.141 --> 15:41.061
Yeah, maybe we'll even
jump on board with sponsors.

15:41.062 --> 15:42.301
Now that would be fantastic.

15:43.242 --> 15:44.905
What you could really use

15:44.906 --> 15:46.864
is someone to be the face of this thing...

15:46.865 --> 15:49.037
Somebody like Juliette Barnes.

15:49.582 --> 15:52.873
(Laughs) What are you gettin' me into now?

15:52.874 --> 15:54.144
- Juliette. Hi.
- Hello.

15:54.145 --> 15:55.494
I think you'd be the perfect centerpiece

15:55.495 --> 15:57.062
for the mayor's music festival.

15:57.063 --> 15:58.477
You know, that's a fantastic idea.

15:58.478 --> 16:00.612
Maybe we can meet and, uh,
discuss the possibilities.

16:01.104 --> 16:02.420
Sure.

16:02.421 --> 16:06.450
Yes, uh, why don't you have
your office contact my manager?

16:06.451 --> 16:08.805
Consider it done. I'll be in touch.

16:08.806 --> 16:10.189
- Thank you.
- Thanks. Bye.

16:10.701 --> 16:12.133
(Inhales sharply) Having fun?

16:12.134 --> 16:13.938
Oh, yes, spending the day with your wife

16:13.939 --> 16:15.903
is exactly what I wanted to do.

16:15.904 --> 16:17.615
Yeah, sorry, I didn't mean
to make that awkward for you.

16:17.616 --> 16:18.772
(Whispers) I just wanted to see you.

16:18.773 --> 16:20.680
Here is not the place.

16:21.262 --> 16:23.542
Yes, I would love to see your horse!

16:25.579 --> 16:28.019
- Oh, yeah... Yeah, just this way.
- (Whispers) Don't touch me.

16:30.664 --> 16:32.479
We can never do this again.

16:32.942 --> 16:35.954
Right, so this is why
you've canceled your shifts

16:35.955 --> 16:37.394
and haven't returned my calls.

16:38.275 --> 16:40.168
I know this is awkward. I know it is.

16:40.169 --> 16:42.605
But I didn't plan on
sleeping with my ex's friend.

16:43.449 --> 16:45.290
But I like you.

16:45.764 --> 16:47.589
Look, Scarlett is my best friend,

16:47.590 --> 16:49.409
your ex-girlfriend, almost fiancée.

16:49.410 --> 16:51.283
This is weird. It just is.

16:51.284 --> 16:53.354
Plus I broke the stupid girl code.

16:53.355 --> 16:54.599
(Scoffs) What... What is that?

16:54.600 --> 16:55.680
The girl code, you know,

16:55.681 --> 16:57.917
thou shalt not sleep with or
date your best friend's ex...

16:57.918 --> 16:59.641
- (Sighs)
- Unless they've moved on or gotten married

16:59.642 --> 17:01.051
- or fled to China.
- (Chuckles)

17:01.052 --> 17:02.388
It's an unspoken rule that I broke,

17:02.389 --> 17:04.734
and now I feel like a
super-slutty bad friend.

17:04.736 --> 17:06.119
No, this... This is ridiculous.

17:06.121 --> 17:08.007
We're adults, all right? I-I like you.

17:08.008 --> 17:09.818
I'm not gonna throw that
away because of some...

17:09.819 --> 17:11.431
Some stupid code, you know?

17:11.432 --> 17:13.727
It's not just a code,
Gunnar. It's about friendship.

17:13.728 --> 17:16.550
We made a huge mistake, and
Scarlett can never find out.

17:19.623 --> 17:20.606
(Sighs)

17:22.561 --> 17:23.886
(Blusters)

17:25.400 --> 17:26.755
(Whinny)

17:27.710 --> 17:30.074
I've been watching you sing
since you were a little girl.

17:30.075 --> 17:32.533
- (Chuckles)
- So... you gonna miss it?

17:33.126 --> 17:36.116
Oh, well, I'll always be performing,

17:36.117 --> 17:39.990
but, um, I'm just excited
about getting into business,

17:39.991 --> 17:42.536
starting a new label. We've
got this wonderful girl

17:42.537 --> 17:44.828
that we're working with right
now... Scarlett o' Connor.

17:44.829 --> 17:46.739
We're about to send her out
on tour as an opening act,

17:46.740 --> 17:48.461
- really great.
- And she's not kidding.

17:48.462 --> 17:49.802
(Singsongy) Scarlett is amazing.

17:49.803 --> 17:50.769
She is amazing.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.484
Her performance at the Opry was incredible.

17:52.848 --> 17:55.321
- Mm-hmm.
- Bill, it's always good to see you.

17:55.322 --> 17:56.522
Tandy.

17:57.569 --> 17:59.103
I'm kind of surprised you're here.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.610
Your father's arrest
has certain implications

18:01.611 --> 18:03.050
to some of the people in this town.

18:03.353 --> 18:05.438
Bill, we both know the
sins of the father...

18:05.439 --> 18:07.177
I mean, it's one thing
for your sister to show up,

18:07.178 --> 18:09.081
but you should know better.

18:09.082 --> 18:10.900
You were Lamar's C.F.O.

18:10.901 --> 18:12.294
I left the company, Bill.

18:12.295 --> 18:14.840
After 15 years of being
his right-hand man...

18:15.353 --> 18:16.659
That's interesting timing.

18:17.593 --> 18:20.093
'Cause if anybody knows your
dad's dirty little secrets,

18:20.094 --> 18:21.419
it's you.

18:22.014 --> 18:23.289
I wouldn't count on any checkbooks

18:23.290 --> 18:24.909
opening up here today.

18:26.598 --> 18:27.910
You know what, Bill?

18:27.911 --> 18:29.880
You'll pardon us for not giving a damn

18:29.881 --> 18:32.181
about you or your checkbook.

18:32.182 --> 18:35.051
But it has been so good seeing you.

18:37.348 --> 18:38.544
Excuse me.

18:38.545 --> 18:39.962
(Horse whinnies)

18:43.275 --> 18:46.386
If I had known that those
tickets were from you,

18:46.387 --> 18:48.208
- I never would have come.
- Exactly.

18:49.004 --> 18:51.164
You just can't take "no"
for an answer, can you?

18:51.165 --> 18:54.034
No. Never valued that skill.
I wanted to see you again.

18:54.035 --> 18:56.570
Well, then I'll send you
an autographed picture.

18:57.550 --> 19:00.058
You... have the perfect life.

19:00.059 --> 19:01.498
Born rich, plays polo,

19:01.499 --> 19:03.964
married to a beautiful, wonderful wife.

19:03.965 --> 19:07.190
Our lives could not be more different.

19:07.624 --> 19:10.657
Just go have some servant
feed you some grapes

19:10.658 --> 19:11.772
and leave me alone.

19:11.773 --> 19:13.891
Oh... that's a very stereotypical picture.

19:13.892 --> 19:16.369
- I'm sorry. Did I get something wrong?
- Yeah, I don't like grapes.

19:18.411 --> 19:19.938
This is just a joke to you.

19:21.065 --> 19:22.432
You sent the car back.

19:22.776 --> 19:24.149
What?

19:24.150 --> 19:26.270
In a world full of people
trying to get something off me,

19:26.572 --> 19:27.691
you sent the car back.

19:28.291 --> 19:29.885
I love that. (Scoffs)

19:29.886 --> 19:32.542
No, you love that I'm not your wife.

19:32.543 --> 19:34.149
I do, but that's because Olivia...

19:35.826 --> 19:36.722
(Sighs) Let's just say

19:36.723 --> 19:38.238
that things aren't always as they seem.

19:38.842 --> 19:40.214
(Whispers) Right.

19:40.215 --> 19:41.778
(Horn blowing) Juliette...

19:41.779 --> 19:43.654
According to Wikipedia, that horn means,

19:43.655 --> 19:45.324
the game's about to start.

- Good.

20:09.607 --> 20:10.794
What in the hell are you doing

20:10.795 --> 20:12.976
- at a polo match in a monkey suit?
- (Chuckles)

20:13.862 --> 20:15.489
I could ask you the same damn thing.

20:15.490 --> 20:17.893
Well, apparently, it's
what rich people do, right?

20:18.292 --> 20:21.056
- You'd be the one to know that.
- (Scoffs) You could have been.

20:21.057 --> 20:22.998
God knows, you were the
one with all the talent.

20:23.747 --> 20:26.291
- That's true.
- Yeah. (Chuckles)

20:26.709 --> 20:28.318
How you been? How are the kids?

20:28.319 --> 20:30.519
- They're good, uh, with my ex.
- Oh.

20:31.099 --> 20:33.293
- Yeah, I was sorry to hear about all that.
- Oh, no.

20:33.294 --> 20:35.429
It's all good. I'm heading
out on tour again soon.

20:35.430 --> 20:37.175
I was real glad to hear about you making it

20:37.176 --> 20:38.406
through that accident.

20:38.407 --> 20:39.918
- How's the hand? Healin' up okay?
- Oh, yeah.

20:39.919 --> 20:41.872
That's good. That's good.
I got another good...

20:41.873 --> 20:43.054
- (Chuckles) Yeah.
- (Chuckles)

20:43.055 --> 20:44.441
So, um...

20:44.442 --> 20:46.271
- You and Rayna...

- (Chuckles) Uh, yes, ma'am.
- (Chuckles)

20:47.914 --> 20:49.965
- Hi. Megan Vannoy.
- (Chuckles) Oh, Luke Wheeler.

20:49.966 --> 20:51.583
I know. Nice to meet you. (Chuckles)

20:51.584 --> 20:52.888
- Nice to meet you.
- She knows, she knows.

20:53.219 --> 20:55.372
(Deacon) That's some game
you got going on out here.

20:55.997 --> 20:57.672
- Have they started yet?
- Ha ha.

20:58.265 --> 21:00.008
Gosh, I think you had the right idea...

21:00.009 --> 21:01.690
Avoiding these people for years.

21:01.691 --> 21:03.128
(Rayna) I think I did, too.

21:03.129 --> 21:05.930
And now even Teddy seems to be avoiding me.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.704
Oh. Well, that make sense. He's the mayor.

21:08.705 --> 21:10.947
(Scoffs) Yeah, and my ex-husband. (Sighs)

21:10.948 --> 21:13.856
And about to marry the
woman he had an affair with

21:13.857 --> 21:15.797
- and then knocked up. So...
- Hmm...

21:16.633 --> 21:18.529
Oh, I swear, with all this...

21:18.530 --> 21:22.016
Daddy, Jeff... I'm very grateful for you.

21:22.017 --> 21:23.151
Thank you.

21:23.671 --> 21:25.814
And all that business with Bill, you know,

21:25.815 --> 21:28.278
obviously, there's no
truth to any of that, right?

21:29.133 --> 21:32.183
No, of course not. Oh,
please, not you, too.

21:32.184 --> 21:33.502
I mean I... I... (Scoffs)

21:33.503 --> 21:35.169
What, you don't trust me all of a sudden?

21:35.170 --> 21:37.562
No. No, no, no. Don't get defensive now.

21:37.563 --> 21:39.639
Come on. No, I'm not getting
defensive. It's just I...

21:39.640 --> 21:41.816
You know my life has changed
a lot here, too. I-I...

21:42.129 --> 21:44.835
(Chuckles) I didn't really
even want to come here today.

21:44.836 --> 21:46.860
I wanted to come and help you.

21:46.861 --> 21:49.536
And I have no regrets, but
I have really changed my life

21:49.537 --> 21:52.389
- to be there for you and the girls.
- I know you have.

21:52.390 --> 21:54.033
I appreciate it so much.

21:55.113 --> 21:57.633
Forget... forget I said
anything. Come on. Let's just...

21:57.634 --> 21:59.720
- Let's do one more lap of this place and...
- All right.

21:59.721 --> 22:01.542
Get the hell outta here.

22:01.543 --> 22:02.887
(Bell clanging)

22:05.013 --> 22:06.327
(Indistinct conversations, laughter)

22:06.880 --> 22:08.681
Not up for stomping divots?

22:08.682 --> 22:11.046
God, maybe you're all crazy.

22:11.047 --> 22:12.213
Do they know how absurd they look?

22:13.120 --> 22:14.421
Absurd's never gotten
in the way of tradition.

22:14.887 --> 22:18.403
I do not... (Chuckles)
Fit in with this crowd.

22:19.252 --> 22:21.495
I think it's time for me to go.

22:21.496 --> 22:23.045
Wait, Juliette.

22:23.046 --> 22:24.697
(Jazz music playing)

22:26.142 --> 22:27.776
I did inherit my money,
but there's not been

22:27.777 --> 22:29.553
a day of my life I haven't worked.

22:30.552 --> 22:31.669
Olivia and I got married

22:31.670 --> 22:32.895
because we were dating in college,

22:32.896 --> 22:34.522
and then after college,
we were still dating.

22:34.523 --> 22:36.823
And then eventually, it just
seemed like the right step.

22:37.394 --> 22:39.309
I play polo 'cause I like horses.

22:40.417 --> 22:42.866
These people aren't my people
any more than they are yours.

22:42.867 --> 22:45.175
Right, so... Underneath it all,

22:45.531 --> 22:48.276
you're just plain simple folk, right?

22:48.584 --> 22:49.775
Yeah, I am.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.858
Stick around and I'll prove it.

23:02.036 --> 23:02.784
(Video game noises)
(Chuckles) Come on.

23:02.785 --> 23:03.952
- Now you're gone.
- What? (Scoffs)

23:04.304 --> 23:05.416
<i>(Gunfire) (Laughs)</i>

23:05.895 --> 23:08.643
This is insane. No, no,
no, I'm gonna beat you.

23:08.644 --> 23:10.248
- (Grunts) Aah! Yes!
- No! No! Ugh!

23:10.249 --> 23:11.412
<i>(Crashing sound) (Laughing)</i>

23:11.413 --> 23:12.874
You know what? That's it.

23:12.875 --> 23:14.363
- I won, I won, I won.
- That's enough.

23:14.364 --> 23:16.335
(Switch clicks) You're cranky
'cause I annihilated you.

23:16.336 --> 23:18.357
What the hell? How'd you get so good?

23:18.358 --> 23:20.256
I used to whup your butt back in college.

23:20.257 --> 23:22.282
I play with Zoey every Sunday after church.

23:22.283 --> 23:23.510
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

23:23.511 --> 23:25.386
- On the Lord's day, no less. Shame on you.
- (Giggles)

23:27.098 --> 23:28.114
(Sighs)

23:29.191 --> 23:31.295
So you, uh, feeling better about tonight?

23:32.052 --> 23:33.329
(Chuckles) Not really.

23:33.791 --> 23:35.358
I-I've played the Bluebird before.

23:35.359 --> 23:38.968
It's just not in front of
a bunch of judgy critics.

23:38.969 --> 23:40.858
Ah. You're gonna be great.

23:43.206 --> 23:45.861
Sorry. I shouldn't go on
about career stuff like that.

23:47.212 --> 23:48.558
Hey, look, um...

23:48.559 --> 23:49.383
(Bottle thuds)

23:50.413 --> 23:52.164
I'm happy to hear about it.

23:52.974 --> 23:54.169
Really.

23:55.032 --> 23:57.279
I mean, I'm not where I hoped I'd be,

23:57.280 --> 23:59.894
but... I'm still tryin'.

24:02.617 --> 24:03.969
I'm really proud of you.

24:06.289 --> 24:09.503
I'm... (Chuckles) Really proud of you, too.

24:10.412 --> 24:12.976
I mean, you've come into
your own, and it's...

24:13.631 --> 24:15.425
Incredibly...

24:16.535 --> 24:18.074
Sexy.

24:18.993 --> 24:20.190
Sexy?

24:20.800 --> 24:22.577
Did I just say that out loud?

24:23.737 --> 24:25.309
Mm-hmm.

24:25.310 --> 24:26.766
Yeah.

24:53.828 --> 24:54.759
(Deacon) So I get home that night,

24:54.760 --> 24:56.706
and I barely... I don't
even make it into my bunk.

24:56.707 --> 24:58.288
I just crawl to the back of the tour bus,

24:58.289 --> 25:00.296
and I don't wake up till, like, noon.

25:00.297 --> 25:02.404
And it is bright out,
and I look out the window,

25:02.405 --> 25:04.641
looking for, you know,
mountains 'cause it's Denver.

25:04.642 --> 25:07.058
But... I see cactus.

25:07.059 --> 25:09.004
- (Laughter)
- And I don't know why.

25:09.005 --> 25:10.937
So I go to the front to ask everybody,

25:10.938 --> 25:13.687
and I don't know a damn person on the bus.

25:13.688 --> 25:15.796
(Chuckles) I'm on the wrong
damn tour bus. (Laughter)

25:16.178 --> 25:18.379
It took me, like, all night.

25:18.380 --> 25:20.987
Anyway, I'm, uh, gonna
quit while I'm ahead.

25:20.988 --> 25:22.247
- I'll get you another drink.
- Okay.

25:22.248 --> 25:23.450
Can I have a, uh, a champagne

25:23.451 --> 25:24.853
and a bourbon, please? Thank you.

25:25.563 --> 25:26.712
(Chuckles)

25:28.050 --> 25:28.968
(Indistinct conversations)

25:30.275 --> 25:31.781
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:31.782 --> 25:34.119
Uh, club soda and a sweet
tea. (Glasses clatter)

25:35.453 --> 25:37.306
A lot of surprising people here today,

25:37.307 --> 25:39.317
but I have to say you take the cake.

25:39.318 --> 25:41.642
Well, right back at you. (Glasses clatter)

25:41.643 --> 25:42.857
(Chuckles) (Chuckles)

25:43.675 --> 25:45.017
I heard you sang on stage.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.260
I did.

25:47.261 --> 25:49.140
That's good. Oh. Come here.

25:49.442 --> 25:50.433
I don't think you two

25:50.434 --> 25:52.012
have had a chance to formally meet.

25:52.013 --> 25:53.209
Rayna, this is Megan.

25:53.210 --> 25:54.725
- Hi.
- Nice to see you.

25:54.726 --> 25:57.328
And you. I was glad to
hear your daughter's okay.

25:57.329 --> 26:00.047
Yes, she's much better, thank you.

26:01.169 --> 26:02.745
<i>(Man) And at the end of the final...</i>

26:02.746 --> 26:04.116
Thank you very much. Uh...

26:04.499 --> 26:06.125
<i>And river view has defeated golden oaks...</i>

26:06.126 --> 26:07.982
- We'll see you, uh, later. Have a good day.
- All right.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.488
- Y'all have fun.
- (Megan) Thanks.

26:17.292 --> 26:18.507
(Amplified voice) We'd
like to start the ceremony

26:18.508 --> 26:21.055
by awarding the champions'
cup to the winning team,

26:21.424 --> 26:25.778
captained by our esteemed
guest, Charles Wentworth.

26:26.155 --> 26:28.159
(Cheering)

26:29.136 --> 26:30.941
Charles, please join us on stage.

26:32.824 --> 26:34.219
Charles?

26:36.734 --> 26:38.238
- Santiago.
- (Juliette) Oh.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.593
I work for Charlie, but the beer's from me.

26:40.594 --> 26:42.069
Thank you. I'm Juliette.

26:42.070 --> 26:43.753
Yeah. We know. (Chuckles) (Chuckles)

26:44.566 --> 26:46.004
Does he always do this?

26:46.698 --> 26:49.511
Every match. I don't even
know why he keeps us around.

26:49.512 --> 26:51.584
He likes to deal with
the horses mainly himself.

26:52.984 --> 26:55.582
Uh, uh, don't even think about it, boss.

26:55.583 --> 26:57.233
- What?
- Hand it over.

26:57.234 --> 26:58.988
This? (Laughs)

26:58.989 --> 27:00.562
Play something for our special guest.

27:00.563 --> 27:02.836
(Laughs) I think you might know this one.

27:03.545 --> 27:06.219
- (Playing "Hypnotizing")
- (Juliette) Ahh, ha ha.

27:06.220 --> 27:07.447
Wow, you keep playing like that,

27:07.448 --> 27:09.129
I might have to steal you from Charlie.

28:22.064 --> 28:23.416
(Inhales deeply)

28:23.788 --> 28:25.332
Did you change your perfume?

28:27.109 --> 28:28.570
No, it's shampoo.

28:28.571 --> 28:29.978
(Chuckles)

28:31.510 --> 28:33.366
I wish you could stay.

28:34.585 --> 28:36.030
Maybe I should get going.

28:36.519 --> 28:38.506
No. No, that's not what I meant.

28:38.507 --> 28:42.261
I-I mean, you should stay if you want to.

28:44.129 --> 28:46.009
Are you working tonight?

28:46.010 --> 28:47.334
Yeah.

28:47.848 --> 28:48.874
All right.

28:48.875 --> 28:50.815
Well, I should probably head out,

28:51.812 --> 28:53.388
but I'll see you there.

28:53.389 --> 28:54.527
Okay.

28:54.528 --> 28:55.701
Okay.

29:02.433 --> 29:03.677
(Sighs)

29:05.492 --> 29:06.747
(Indistinct conversations)

29:07.385 --> 29:08.846
(Laughs and speaks indistinctly)

29:11.867 --> 29:13.116
(Laughter, indistinct conversations)

29:16.961 --> 29:20.000
Oh. Hey, I didn't realize
you were still here.

29:20.001 --> 29:21.032
Mm-hmm.

29:21.996 --> 29:22.870
Okay.

29:23.190 --> 29:24.395
What?

29:24.396 --> 29:25.535
Charlie Wentworth?

29:26.502 --> 29:27.963
We're good friends.

29:28.935 --> 29:31.461
- Okay. Cool.
- Mm-hmm.

29:32.655 --> 29:34.027
What are you implying?

29:34.028 --> 29:35.731
I'm not implying anything.

29:36.805 --> 29:41.437
Listen... he's a powerful,
prominent, married man.

29:42.241 --> 29:45.499
Our industry is primarily
driven by female fans.

29:46.141 --> 29:48.816
A lot of times they don't take
to that kind of thing too well,

29:48.817 --> 29:49.921
that's all.

29:49.922 --> 29:50.939
(Scoffs)

29:51.483 --> 29:53.397
You know, Glenn said
that you wanted to know

29:53.398 --> 29:54.909
about Scarlett coming on tour with me,

29:55.216 --> 29:56.509
and after this conversation,

29:56.510 --> 29:58.668
I'm thinking the answer is "hell, no."

30:00.729 --> 30:02.023
(Sighs)

30:21.244 --> 30:22.769
(Exhales deeply)

30:22.770 --> 30:26.076
You know you don't perform
for another four hours, right?

30:27.199 --> 30:28.595
I slept with Avery.

30:28.919 --> 30:30.023
<i>What?</i>

30:30.024 --> 30:31.856
We were talking business advice one minute,

30:31.857 --> 30:33.429
and the next, we were in bed.

30:34.654 --> 30:36.984
Wow. How do you feel about that?

30:37.332 --> 30:38.877
It's kinda stupid.

30:38.878 --> 30:41.653
(Scoffs) No judgment here. I get it.

30:41.654 --> 30:43.387
Heart wants what the heart wants.

30:43.965 --> 30:45.840
I don't know if it's what my heart wants.

30:47.892 --> 30:49.822
It did kinda feel like home, though.

30:51.669 --> 30:53.639
(Exhales) Sure it didn't just happen

30:53.640 --> 30:55.477
because you're feeling overwhelmed?

30:56.693 --> 30:57.877
Maybe.

30:59.058 --> 31:00.431
Maybe not.

31:01.290 --> 31:03.203
You're the one that insisted
we come to Tennessee,

31:03.204 --> 31:05.284
- and then you just disappeared!
- Keep your voice down.

31:05.285 --> 31:07.650
I didn't even wanna come here, Charlie.

31:07.651 --> 31:09.683
I don't even know why we
came to this stupid event.

31:09.684 --> 31:11.202
'Cause it's a chance
to meet some new people.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.364
And for one second, maybe
if you could just step out

31:13.365 --> 31:14.879
of your snotty world view... (Slap)

31:16.815 --> 31:17.741
(Exhales deeply)

31:17.742 --> 31:20.083
I don't care about these people.

31:21.899 --> 31:25.029
I'm taking the jet. You
can find your own way home.

31:28.388 --> 31:29.931
- Juliette!
- Hey.

31:29.932 --> 31:31.231
It is so great to see you again.

31:31.232 --> 31:32.936
Thank you so much for coming.

31:32.937 --> 31:34.229
My pleasure.

31:36.109 --> 31:37.631
She told you, didn't she?

31:37.950 --> 31:39.338
She did.

31:39.339 --> 31:41.281
Look, I know what you're probably thinking.

31:41.282 --> 31:42.519
It's... it's a bad idea,

31:42.520 --> 31:44.039
especially since you
know the entire history

31:44.040 --> 31:46.449
- of our relationship.
- It's not my business.

31:46.450 --> 31:48.053
Well, it's not like I
can make up for the past,

31:48.054 --> 31:49.886
but if we did get back together,

31:50.233 --> 31:52.251
it'd be different, you know?

31:52.252 --> 31:53.829
I mean, I-I would be different.

31:54.211 --> 31:56.861
So you wanna give it
another shot with Scarlett.

31:57.336 --> 31:59.647
Uh, uh, I-I don't know. Does she?

32:06.531 --> 32:07.856
(Sighs)

32:09.562 --> 32:11.938
Thank you for coming to the match today...

32:12.321 --> 32:13.623
And for enduring dinner.

32:13.624 --> 32:15.011
Well, it was fun.

32:15.528 --> 32:16.524
(Jacket thuds)

32:16.525 --> 32:18.076
You know, it's funny. I used to think polo

32:18.077 --> 32:20.133
was just a bunch of rich
guys riding around on horses,

32:20.134 --> 32:21.667
smacking a ball.

32:22.431 --> 32:23.805
Turns out I was right. (Chuckles)

32:25.796 --> 32:28.710
Well, at least you got to
see your old pal Luke Wheeler.

32:28.711 --> 32:29.772
Yeah.

32:30.193 --> 32:31.350
And Rayna.

32:33.129 --> 32:34.397
Good times.

32:35.444 --> 32:37.748
Yeah, seemed like you
pulled me away from her,

32:37.749 --> 32:40.223
like you're a little uncomfortable there.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.147
Nope. (Object thuds)

32:43.148 --> 32:44.706
And it's okay if you were.

32:45.337 --> 32:47.389
I'm not threatened by her, Deacon.

32:47.390 --> 32:49.015
I know the two of you have a past...

32:49.897 --> 32:51.173
And a daughter.

32:51.688 --> 32:53.093
It's okay.

32:54.552 --> 32:56.724
It really doesn't bother you, does it?

32:57.605 --> 32:59.335
As you would say...

32:59.336 --> 33:00.615
Nope.

33:04.516 --> 33:05.727
You wanna spend the night?

33:07.449 --> 33:09.159
Like I did last night?

33:10.305 --> 33:11.767
Yep.

33:12.569 --> 33:14.223
<i>(Max Gomez' "True Blue" playing)</i>

33:14.582 --> 33:16.869
<i>* I'm writing to say *</i>

33:19.452 --> 33:20.346
Hey.

33:20.347 --> 33:21.279
Hey.

33:21.280 --> 33:23.194
Didn't know if you were
working tonight or not.

33:23.195 --> 33:24.509
Yeah, yeah, I am.

33:25.042 --> 33:26.359
Big night for you, huh?

33:27.126 --> 33:29.030
Well, I'm trying not to
think about it too much.

33:30.580 --> 33:31.809
Sure feels like a long time ago

33:32.334 --> 33:33.877
that you and I first sang here.

33:34.416 --> 33:35.552
Yeah, it does.

33:36.833 --> 33:38.996
I'm-a let you get to it, but don't worry.

33:38.997 --> 33:40.572
I got you covered back there.

33:40.573 --> 33:41.789
Thanks.

33:44.843 --> 33:45.760
(Singsongy) Hey.

33:45.761 --> 33:47.007
Hey. (Chuckles)

33:47.008 --> 33:48.195
How you feel?

33:48.196 --> 33:49.315
- Excited.
- Good.

33:49.316 --> 33:51.355
Hey, listen, honey, this is your night.

33:51.356 --> 33:53.221
You have fun up there, all right?

33:53.642 --> 33:55.617
- Can I introduce you to some people?
- Yeah.

33:55.618 --> 33:56.179
Come on.

33:57.709 --> 33:59.497
Brian Mansfield from "USA Today."

33:59.498 --> 34:00.627
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:00.628 --> 34:02.485
Cliff Jenkins from "Country Weekly."

34:02.486 --> 34:03.241
- How you doing?
- Hi.

34:03.242 --> 34:04.199
Two of my favorite people.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.455
This is the incomparable Scarlett o'Connor.

34:06.456 --> 34:08.797
Oh, thank you so much
for being here tonight.

34:08.799 --> 34:10.248
- It really is a pleasure to meet you.
- Thanks for having us.

34:10.248 --> 34:11.737
We're looking forward to your performance.

34:12.335 --> 34:14.851
Can y'all excuse me for a sec? Hey.

34:14.853 --> 34:15.739
Hey.

34:15.739 --> 34:17.106
- You made it.
- Yeah.

34:17.107 --> 34:19.025
- Thanks for comin'.
- I'm glad you invited me.

34:19.025 --> 34:20.286
Yeah. I'm happy to see you.

34:20.288 --> 34:22.792
These are my people, see?
Not those stuffy polo types.

34:22.793 --> 34:25.096
Well, stuffy or not, it
was really good to see you.

34:25.097 --> 34:27.434
That was... An unexpected surprise.

34:27.435 --> 34:29.241
- It was. It was.
- Yeah.

34:29.242 --> 34:30.745
I can't wait for you to hear Scarlett sing.

34:30.746 --> 34:32.074
She is incredible.

34:32.076 --> 34:32.983
Can't wait.

34:32.984 --> 34:33.842
You know these guys?

34:33.844 --> 34:36.321
Yeah. Hey. Hey there. Good to see you.

34:37.693 --> 34:39.524
I really need to talk to you.

34:40.291 --> 34:43.371
Uh, I'm kinda busy right now. I-I can't.

34:43.373 --> 34:44.550
Okay?

34:45.068 --> 34:47.143
Can I at least get, like,
five minutes later on?

34:48.121 --> 34:50.690
Uh... sure.

34:50.692 --> 34:51.995
- Later.
- Okay.

34:55.335 --> 34:57.716
(Piano playing light jazz)

34:57.717 --> 34:58.838
Here you are, sir.

34:58.839 --> 34:59.931
(Sighs)

35:06.639 --> 35:07.792
Can I buy you a drink?

35:07.793 --> 35:09.395
I can buy myself a drink, thank you.

35:09.396 --> 35:10.486
(Glass clatters) Of course.

35:10.487 --> 35:11.141
Mm-hmm.

35:11.142 --> 35:13.472
You don't need me or
anything I have to offer.

35:13.473 --> 35:14.684
I get it.

35:15.267 --> 35:16.450
So why are you here?

35:18.688 --> 35:20.947
I had fun with you today,

35:20.948 --> 35:23.002
with the grooms and the stableboys.

35:23.893 --> 35:24.988
And?

35:24.989 --> 35:26.376
I saw you and Olivia.

35:26.962 --> 35:28.981
Well, then you have a good glimpse

35:28.982 --> 35:31.449
of what my life's been like
for the last five years.

35:31.450 --> 35:33.592
Oh, am I supposed to feel sorry for you?

35:33.911 --> 35:36.343
Poor little rich boy stuck
in a loveless marriage.

35:36.344 --> 35:37.224
Sad but true.

35:37.225 --> 35:38.978
Mm-hmm, well,
I've got a bucket of sad stories

35:38.979 --> 35:41.989
that could top that one,
but I'm done sharing 'em.

35:43.231 --> 35:45.256
I've been thinking about
mayor Conrad's offer

35:45.257 --> 35:46.930
and the music festival.

35:48.995 --> 35:50.637
I think we should work on it together.

35:51.407 --> 35:53.098
It's the perfect situation, really.

35:53.099 --> 35:54.312
You're a billionaire businessman.

35:54.313 --> 35:56.344
I'm a star about to go on tour.

35:57.910 --> 36:00.778
Six weeks of planning, and then we're done.

36:01.541 --> 36:03.232
Understood.

36:03.233 --> 36:05.663
Well, seeing as my wife has just left town,

36:05.664 --> 36:08.412
and I have the penthouse to myself,

36:09.308 --> 36:10.963
why don't we have a
little... (Card clatters)

What?

38:56.557 --> 38:57.876
Everything I said this morning was wrong.

38:57.877 --> 38:59.293
I take it all back.

38:59.913 --> 39:02.990
Okay, so... What's that supposed to mean?

39:04.234 --> 39:07.183
(Lowered voice) It means
you should kiss me right now, you idiot.

(Cheers and applause continue)

39:49.368 --> 39:50.440
Thank you so much.

39:50.441 --> 39:52.179
I really appreciate you
all coming out here tonight.

39:56.346 --> 39:57.628
So proud of you.

39:58.231 --> 39:59.606
That was amazing.

39:59.607 --> 40:00.912
I couldn't have done it without you.

40:01.485 --> 40:03.000
This is Luke Wheeler.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.436
Oh! (Laughs) So nice to meet you.

40:04.437 --> 40:06.050
- Scarlett o'Connor.
- Great to meet you. Great job, Scarlett.

40:06.051 --> 40:08.351
- Thank you so much. Oh, my goodness.
- Yeah, real nice. (Laughs)

40:09.025 --> 40:10.071
- Wow.
- What'd y'all think?

40:10.398 --> 40:11.928
Thank you very much for being here.

40:11.929 --> 40:13.630
It was lovely to meet you both. Thank you.

40:14.378 --> 40:16.009
Just give me two seconds. (Mouths words)

40:17.028 --> 40:20.492
Hey, that was something spectacular.

40:20.493 --> 40:22.122
- Thank you.
- It was lightning in a bottle.

40:22.123 --> 40:24.257
Aw. I'm really glad you were here.

40:25.061 --> 40:26.361
Listen, I don't wanna keep you

40:26.750 --> 40:29.542
if you need to go and press the flesh or...

40:29.543 --> 40:31.227
Oh, listen, uh, uh...

40:31.228 --> 40:33.122
I'm not exactly sure what happened...

40:33.123 --> 40:34.924
Between us just before.

40:34.925 --> 40:36.003
Really? I was kinda hoping

40:36.004 --> 40:37.747
you might have some thoughts on that.

40:38.261 --> 40:41.758
Well, maybe we don't have
to figure it out just now.

40:41.759 --> 40:43.889
It's not like I'm
leaving for tour tomorrow.

40:45.454 --> 40:46.957
Right. Guess we have some time then.

40:46.958 --> 40:48.103
Little bit.

40:52.445 --> 40:54.580
Sorry. (Laughs) Hi!

40:54.581 --> 40:57.238
Thank you so much for coming.
It was lovely to meet you all.

40:57.592 --> 40:59.118
So what'd you think of Scarlett?

40:59.119 --> 41:00.751
Well, she's a real special girl,

41:00.752 --> 41:02.398
and you're lucky to have her on your label.

41:02.399 --> 41:04.818
Hell, she's really lucky
to have you on her side.

41:04.819 --> 41:07.697
Yeah, she is amazingly talented. (Chuckles)

41:08.067 --> 41:09.305
Really.

41:10.594 --> 41:11.812
This is me.

41:11.813 --> 41:13.420
Yep. (Clears throat)

41:14.638 --> 41:16.236
So I, um...

41:18.127 --> 41:20.717
I was sort of thinkin' that I might ask you

41:20.718 --> 41:24.663
about... The possibility of

41:24.664 --> 41:27.918
Scarlett being one of your
opening acts on the tour.

41:28.321 --> 41:29.778
(Chuckles)

41:29.779 --> 41:32.617
I know. It's last minute
'cause you're leaving soon...

41:32.618 --> 41:33.903
Come here.

41:40.602 --> 41:42.796
I was not expecting that. (Chuckles)

41:42.797 --> 41:44.493
I was.

41:44.494 --> 41:47.236
Anyway, I hope you don't think
I brought you here for that or...

41:47.237 --> 41:48.931
Look, I'm gonna say "yes"

41:48.932 --> 41:50.795
'cause Scarlett is crazy talented.

41:50.796 --> 41:52.916
Trust me, if she wasn't up
to snuff, I wouldn't do it.

41:54.368 --> 41:55.822
But I'd be lying if I said

41:55.823 --> 41:58.619
I wasn't looking forward to
seeing you out on the road.

42:00.991 --> 42:02.515
Okay, then.

42:02.516 --> 42:03.993
Okay.

42:04.417 --> 42:05.935
Thanks for comin'.

42:05.936 --> 42:07.594
Thanks for askin'.

42:09.103 --> 42:10.458
Good night.

42:11.093 --> 42:12.458
Night.
