We can't keep allowing them

02:52.520 --> 02:55.120
We cannot keep allowing them
to do this. Show some respect!

03:02.160 --> 03:04.000

08:29.200 --> 08:30.960
Can I use a computer?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000

10:44.800 --> 10:46.680
There was a petition.
There's nothing I can do.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.000
I've been accepted

10:48.000 --> 10:48.880
I've been accepted

10:48.920 --> 10:50.640

Step back now.

11:05.640 --> 11:07.360
I'm sorry,
there's nothing you can do.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.320
Sir, please.
They're like family to me.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.520
You have to let them
call somebody. Please.

11:12.640 --> 11:14.400
Step back now!

11:14.440 --> 11:16.600

11:23.160 --> 11:24.960
Aisha. Aisha, don't!

11:25.000 --> 11:26.600
It will be bad for you.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.000
Come on. Let's go.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.000
Habiba, be strong!

11:52.000 --> 11:52.320
Habiba, be strong!

11:54.200 --> 11:56.600
I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.560
What's happened? I don't understand.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.000
Don't worry. It will be OK.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.480
Don't worry. It will be OK.

12:00.520 --> 12:04.000
Come on, folks. Let's
move it back inside now, please.

12:04.040 --> 12:06.520
Come on. There is no need
for you to be out here.

12:07.440 --> 12:08.000
That means you
as well. Back inside, please.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.040
That means you
as well. Back inside, please.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.240
This in not a prison.
We can stand here.

12:13.280 --> 12:16.000
Keep that up. See where it gets you.

12:16.000 --> 12:16.120
Keep that up. See where it gets you.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.280
Aisha. Hang on for a sec.

13:19.480 --> 13:20.000
Thank you.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Thank you.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.360
How are you?

13:22.400 --> 13:23.720
I'm fine.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.720
You're quiet today.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.480
I'm just not sleeping well.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.080
Treat yourself.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.280
I can show you
where I want you to put it.

13:46.560 --> 13:49.840
Quick. We're closing.
What's that you have there?

13:49.880 --> 13:51.600
It's just food.

13:51.640 --> 13:52.000
I'm just asking her
to heat it up for me.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.040
I'm just asking her
to heat it up for me.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.120
You have a complaint about the food?

13:58.160 --> 14:00.000
No, Sir. But this is halal.

14:00.000 --> 14:00.520
No, Sir. But this is halal.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.400
We serve halal meat.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.320
You do not.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.240
I asked you many times
to see your certificate.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.640
You said no. You refused.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.000
So, you're saying I'm lying?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.040
So, you're saying I'm lying?

14:09.080 --> 14:11.480
Did I call you that?
Never call him that.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.680
OK, this carry on stops now.
There is nothing-

14:13.720 --> 14:16.000
I'm just asking her to use
the microwave for three minutes!

14:16.000 --> 14:16.200
I'm just asking her to use
the microwave for three minutes!

14:16.240 --> 14:18.640
Please, now. I'm sorry.
Why are you giving him that?

14:18.680 --> 14:20.760
That's mine.
I paid for that with my own money.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.320
You take what we offer. I'm sorry.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.760
So you won't let me use it?

14:26.800 --> 14:28.480
I can't.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.120
Fine.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.000
Come down tonight and
I'll let you in the kitchen.

14:56.000 --> 14:56.440
Come down tonight and
I'll let you in the kitchen.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.920
I put that meal
in the fridge for you.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.200
Just a sec.

15:46.560 --> 15:49.040
Don't know why
he can't get you's the right food.

15:55.840 --> 15:57.760
It costs more.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.720
Less profit for him.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.960
Have you heard from that family?

16:11.640 --> 16:13.360
I just do what I'm told.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.000
Could they have done it without you?

16:16.000 --> 16:16.480
Could they have done it without you?

16:26.480 --> 16:28.080
How long were they here?

16:29.240 --> 16:30.840
Five years.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.280
Where they now?

16:36.840 --> 16:39.240
In a detention centre in the UK.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.000
I didn't know I'd be doing
stuff like that.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.400
I didn't know I'd be doing
stuff like that.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.920
I normally just do
offices and warehouses.

17:04.360 --> 17:07.160
They tell us not to talk to you's.
I don't know if you's know that.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.400
So you's don't try and get us
to break the rules or whatever.

17:10.440 --> 17:12.000
So why you talking to me?

17:12.000 --> 17:12.440
So why you talking to me?

17:39.040 --> 17:40.640
Thank you.

18:23.640 --> 18:24.000
I'm doing an evening course
in September in town.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.160
I'm doing an evening course

If I pass that, then I can apply to
the access courses in the colleges.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.600
If I pass that, then I can apply to
the access courses in the colleges.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.200
They do interviews, so...

18:38.240 --> 18:40.000
you never know.

18:40.000 --> 18:40.440
you never know.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.680
I can talk myself up anyway.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.160
Do you live in the city?

18:44.200 --> 18:46.640
Yeah. I live with me Ma.
Just for now.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.000
What do you think of your job?

18:50.920 --> 18:52.920
I like it. It is OK.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.160
What is it, hairdressing?

Hair and Beauty.

18:56.000 --> 18:56.920

You like all that?

19:02.920 --> 19:04.000

19:04.000 --> 19:04.520
The treatments an' all.

19:06.280 --> 19:08.040
It is OK.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.720
People like to come and talk.

19:10.680 --> 19:12.000
I just like to listen to them.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.240
I just like to listen to them.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.680
That's good.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.720
You're a good listener, I'd say.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.720
Shit. See you later.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.160
See you.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.240
Why you jealous, eh?
Why you jealous?

19:45.280 --> 19:48.080
Please, let me shine. Let me shine.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.720
What do you mean,
"always another one?"

19:49.760 --> 19:51.360
Just do her make-up, please.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.000
Don't start!
No fighting in here!

19:52.000 --> 19:54.200
Don't start!
No fighting in here!

19:55.640 --> 19:59.000
Just going to put a little red
on there, like that. Yeah.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.000
I have tried as much as possible
to cover those dark areas.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.160
I have tried as much as possible
to cover those dark areas.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.840
No, you're beautiful, Auntie.
Thank you.

20:05.880 --> 20:08.000
You don't need to cover,
but you know.

20:08.000 --> 20:08.160
You don't need to cover,
but you know.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.040
Yes, you're getting there!

20:12.080 --> 20:13.760
You want to add a little more?

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Everybody's case is different.

20:16.000 --> 20:16.560
Everybody's case is different.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.920
Whatever you say at times,

20:18.960 --> 20:21.000
can get you out of that place

20:21.040 --> 20:22.640
into another place.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.000
The following morning
you are already onto another centre.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.880
The following morning
you are already onto another centre.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.360
Hm-mm.
Maybe they don't like you

20:28.400 --> 20:30.240
or maybe you talk too much,

20:30.280 --> 20:32.000
maybe you ask questions too much,

20:32.000 --> 20:32.400
maybe you ask questions too much,

20:32.440 --> 20:36.000
maybe you are flouting their rules,
and all those things.

20:36.040 --> 20:38.320
After two weeks, one month,

20:38.360 --> 20:40.000
you will find there is
no chain in my hand,

20:40.000 --> 20:41.720
you will find there is
no chain in my hand,

20:41.760 --> 20:43.320
but I am a prisoner, you know.

20:43.360 --> 20:45.520
I am not allowed to travel.
Mm-hmm.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.680
Of course,
I don't know anyone for myself

20:47.720 --> 20:48.000
but you're not allowed to travel
or overnight to sleep outside.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.280
but you're not allowed to travel
or overnight to sleep outside.

20:52.320 --> 20:54.640
When I came, we were not allowed
to have microwave,

20:54.680 --> 20:56.000
fridge, cookers,
and all that, you know.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.160
fridge, cookers,
and all that, you know.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.640
And so... I... how...

21:00.680 --> 21:03.880
If I buy lollipop for my child,
where am I going to put it?

21:03.920 --> 21:04.000
If he wants ice lolly,
where am I going to put it?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.200
If he wants ice lolly,
where am I going to put it?

21:06.240 --> 21:09.480
You know such things,
I would love to buy it but I can't.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.760
The only time they will
give it to you in the hotel

21:11.800 --> 21:12.000
is when they buy it
on that particular day, you know.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.920
is when they buy it
on that particular day, you know.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.640
How do I explain that to my child?

21:16.680 --> 21:18.440
I want to provide for my child.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.000
I want to work.
I'm not allowed to work.

21:20.000 --> 21:20.480
I want to work.
I'm not allowed to work.

21:20.520 --> 21:23.080
I want to study.
I'm not allowed to study.

21:23.120 --> 21:26.440
You know?
Such things, it's just a lot.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.000
Deportation is the
painful thing ever.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.520
Deportation is the
painful thing ever.

21:30.560 --> 21:34.400
You're thinking,
"OK, I've been tortured back home.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.000
I came here for safety

21:36.000 --> 21:36.480
I came here for safety

21:36.520 --> 21:42.280
and then I was traumatised
inside these little rooms...

21:42.320 --> 21:44.000
where I was living
in a little prison.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
where I was living
in a little prison.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.800
Now that I have to be free,

21:46.840 --> 21:50.320
I 'm told that I am
being deported," you know?

21:50.360 --> 21:52.000
Mm-hmm.
It's so, so painful

21:52.000 --> 21:54.440
Mm-hmm.
It's so, so painful

21:54.480 --> 21:58.240
and I've seen people
going through that.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.120
OK. Don't change any of the answers
that you give in the interview

22:22.160 --> 22:24.000
to what you've written here...

22:24.000 --> 22:24.520
to what you've written here...

22:24.560 --> 22:27.160
..because we could be refused
on credibility grounds.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.440
When you do answer
the questions in the interview

22:31.480 --> 22:32.000
you have to be prepared
to go into detail.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.080
you have to be prepared
to go into detail.

22:39.080 --> 22:40.000
OK.

22:40.000 --> 22:40.680
OK.

22:41.600 --> 22:45.440
OK, let's start with...

22:45.480 --> 22:47.880
what led you to seek protection?

22:49.120 --> 22:51.120
There was an attack on your home?

22:52.160 --> 22:53.240
Yes.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.280
Your father and brother were killed?

22:56.640 --> 22:58.040
Yes.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.880
Am I meant to say more?

23:03.920 --> 23:04.000
If you can.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.520
If you can.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.400
I've written it down.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.840
I know.

23:14.080 --> 23:16.280
A group of men came.

23:17.840 --> 23:20.000
They attacked our home.

23:20.040 --> 23:22.440
Aisha, try and keep eye contact.

23:23.960 --> 23:26.280
Who were these men?

23:26.320 --> 23:28.000
They was people that my father knew.

23:28.000 --> 23:28.680
They was people that my father knew.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.320
How did he know them?

23:32.200 --> 23:34.320
He borrowed money from them.

23:34.360 --> 23:36.000
And you were there?

23:36.000 --> 23:36.040
And you were there?

23:39.880 --> 23:41.640
How long did it last?

23:44.360 --> 23:46.160
I-I don't know.

23:47.360 --> 23:50.200
In the questionnaire you said
they were there for an hour.

23:53.240 --> 23:54.520
I can't remember.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.720
I'm sorry, Aisha,
but we can't be vague about this.

23:56.760 --> 23:59.720
We have to be clear because
they will pick up on any discrepancy

23:59.760 --> 24:00.000
between what you said then
and what you say now.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.560
between what you said then
and what you say now.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.480
Do you understand?

24:04.520 --> 24:05.920
Yes.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.000
So, how long were they there?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.040
So, how long were they there?

24:14.440 --> 24:16.000
One hour.

24:16.000 --> 24:16.080
One hour.

24:49.720 --> 24:52.320
Come on, I need to shower.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.720
Take your foot off the bus, please.
Can you not see her running?

25:10.600 --> 25:12.000
Thanks.

25:12.000 --> 25:12.200
Thanks.

25:17.240 --> 25:19.040
Did you go to college?

25:19.080 --> 25:20.000
I went to university in Benin.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.720
I went to university in Benin.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.400
Doing what?

25:24.440 --> 25:26.640
Geography and Regional Planning.

25:27.520 --> 25:28.000
Sounds good, it does.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.160
Sounds good, it does.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.400
Did you finish it?

25:33.520 --> 25:34.920
No.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.560
When's your interview?

25:49.360 --> 25:51.080
April third.

25:56.560 --> 25:58.560
This bus is no longer in service.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.000
Please board the bus ahead of us.

26:00.000 --> 26:00.240
Please board the bus ahead of us.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.560
Board the bus in front. Thank you.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.480
You're lovely looking.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.680
Where are you from?

26:29.720 --> 26:31.320
Nigeria.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.080
Why'd you leave?

26:35.960 --> 26:38.160
Like, is there something
that made you decide?

26:40.120 --> 26:42.120
No, I just had to move.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.000
Are you an asylum seeker?

26:48.000 --> 26:48.120
Are you an asylum seeker?

26:51.520 --> 26:53.160
From a war?

26:54.440 --> 26:55.840
No.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.760
It's good that they let you's
work now, isn't it?

27:04.720 --> 27:07.160
After nine months. But...

27:07.200 --> 27:09.440
not everybody get a chance to work.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
You're lucky then, aren't you?

27:12.000 --> 27:13.560
You're lucky then, aren't you?

27:19.040 --> 27:20.000
So, if you want to say,
"How are you today?"

27:20.000 --> 27:21.880
So, if you want to say,
"How are you today?"

27:21.920 --> 27:25.120
You say, "How you dey today?"

27:25.160 --> 27:26.840
How you dey today?
How you dey today?

27:26.880 --> 27:28.000
S-Say it to her.
How you dey today?

27:28.000 --> 27:28.560
S-Say it to her.
How you dey today?

27:28.600 --> 27:30.800
Mm-hmm. See, she knows.

27:30.840 --> 27:33.320
She's just pretending
she doesn't know.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.800
Or you can say, um...

27:36.880 --> 27:39.360
"I'm fine" is,
"I dey fine. I dey OK".

27:39.400 --> 27:40.760
I dey OK.
I dey OK.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.120
I dey OK.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.000
"I don't know" is "I no know."

27:44.000 --> 27:44.280
"I don't know" is "I no know."

27:44.320 --> 27:46.560
I know no? I no know.
I know no? I no know.

27:46.600 --> 27:49.040
I know no?
What? What's-

27:49.080 --> 27:50.880
I know no.
What's happening?

27:50.920 --> 27:52.000
I've no idea.

27:52.000 --> 27:52.960
I've no idea.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.840
"What's happening"
is "Wetin dey happen?"

27:55.880 --> 27:57.280
We'in dey happen, Aisha?
Wetin-

27:57.320 --> 27:58.800
Wetin dey happen?
We'in dey happen. No.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.000
Wetin dey happen?
You have to say the 't'.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.080
Wetin dey happen?
You have to say the 't'.

28:01.120 --> 28:03.000
Wetin dey happen?
Wetin dey happen?

28:03.040 --> 28:05.480
Mm-mm. And when you're
vexed with somebody

28:05.520 --> 28:07.440
you can say

28:07.480 --> 28:08.000
"Get out of here"

28:08.000 --> 28:09.080
"Get out of here"

28:09.120 --> 28:12.120
"Comot! Comot here. Make you dey go"

28:12.160 --> 28:13.440
Comot.
Comot here.

28:13.480 --> 28:15.080
Comot.
Tell it. S-Say it.

28:28.760 --> 28:31.720
I don't like hot food.
So why did you finish it?

28:33.200 --> 28:34.600
I dunno.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.640
I'll help you.

28:53.040 --> 28:55.880
What's that?

28:55.920 --> 28:56.000
My mate.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.720
My mate.

28:58.960 --> 29:00.960
What happened to him?

29:01.000 --> 29:02.840
He took his life.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.000
Fifteen, he was.

29:04.000 --> 29:04.480
Fifteen, he was.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.760
Why?

29:10.400 --> 29:12.000
A bloke who played football with us
took Barry into his garage

29:12.000 --> 29:12.840
A bloke who played football with us
took Barry into his garage

29:12.880 --> 29:14.480
and threatened him.

29:17.240 --> 29:19.040
He abused a few kids.

29:22.280 --> 29:23.880
He told you?

29:25.720 --> 29:27.520
We told each other.

29:40.640 --> 29:42.320
I'm so sorry.

29:42.360 --> 29:43.880
It's grand.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.960
I talked about it
in treatment, so...

30:01.120 --> 30:04.440
Manning was asking
about that CCTV camera.

30:04.480 --> 30:06.320
We probably should go.

30:06.360 --> 30:07.920
OK.

30:13.040 --> 30:15.400
See you tomorrow.
Yeah.

30:46.480 --> 30:48.000
Can I talk to you?

30:48.000 --> 30:48.640
Can I talk to you?

30:48.680 --> 30:49.960
Yeah.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.600
Come round.

31:40.880 --> 31:42.680
Take your time.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.080
It's Manning. It's grand.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.000
Sorry.

32:16.000 --> 32:16.200
Sorry.

32:16.240 --> 32:17.760
Aisha, it's OK.
I'm sorry.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.640
Aisha.
I'm fine.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.560
Ah! My sister,
you don nearly finish?

32:58.840 --> 33:00.840
I'm heading home.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.600
Are you alright?

33:02.640 --> 33:04.000
I'm fine.

33:04.000 --> 33:04.840
I'm fine.

33:04.880 --> 33:07.400
Did Manning see me?

33:07.440 --> 33:09.440
I said you weren't feeling well.

33:13.320 --> 33:15.280
Look-
It's fine.

33:16.440 --> 33:18.120
I don't need to talk about it.

33:18.160 --> 33:20.000
Yeah, but...

33:20.000 --> 33:20.120
Yeah, but...

33:20.160 --> 33:23.320
you can tell me
whatever you want, yeah?

33:30.520 --> 33:32.200
I'm not in tomorrow.

33:33.160 --> 33:34.560
OK.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.000
There's a letter here for you.

33:52.000 --> 33:52.720
There's a letter here for you.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.320
No, it's grand.

33:56.360 --> 33:58.360
It's been here since yesterday.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.400
Let me call you back.
What is this?

34:15.760 --> 34:16.000
I have to go. OK, bye.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.880
I have to go. OK, bye.

34:17.920 --> 34:19.800
What is this? You can't move me.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.200
Yes I can.
I have rights.

34:22.240 --> 34:23.360
Of course you do.

34:23.400 --> 34:24.000
It's illegal for you to move me
without a chance to appeal.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.920
It's illegal for you to move me
without a chance to appeal.

34:25.960 --> 34:27.120
No, that's wrong.

34:27.160 --> 34:29.440
Ah? European Law says different.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.160
You're an expert now, are you?

34:32.000 --> 34:34.600
Why are you doing this?
I want to put a family in that room.

34:34.640 --> 34:37.720
Why? Because I'm trying
to keep them together.

34:37.760 --> 34:40.000
Now, you're going to have to
get your things together quickly.

34:40.000 --> 34:40.120
Now, you're going to have to
get your things together quickly.

34:40.160 --> 34:42.400
I've got a taxi booked to take
you to the station at three.

34:42.440 --> 34:44.320
So, you're moving me today?
Yes.

34:44.360 --> 34:46.200
Where are you taking me?

34:46.240 --> 34:48.000
You're going to a centre in...

34:48.000 --> 34:49.640
You're going to a centre in...

34:49.680 --> 34:51.760
..Glentill. It's down South.

34:51.800 --> 34:55.560
I have my job here.
My-My finances to help my mum.

34:55.600 --> 34:56.000
My solicitor is here.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.120
My solicitor is here.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.960
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not moving.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.560
OK, that's fine.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.720
But you'll be sure to let
the IPO know your new address

35:03.760 --> 35:04.000
because you'll need that
for your application.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.480
because you'll need that
for your application.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.000
And, obviously,
all payments will stop as well.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.400
So, you want to be spiteful to me?

35:22.600 --> 35:24.640
You can move me to self-catering.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Those centres are full.
Can you check?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.360
Those centres are full.
Can you check?

35:29.400 --> 35:30.960
I don't need to check.
I check all the time.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.480
Please.

35:33.880 --> 35:35.280
I'm sorry.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.760
Now, if you don't mind,
I've got work to do.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.720
CATHERINE :
Why don't you stay here for a while?

35:49.760 --> 35:52.000
I need a permanent
address for my application.

35:52.000 --> 35:52.720
I need a permanent
address for my application.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.560
I'm really sorry.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.880
I feel really embarrassed.

36:01.840 --> 36:05.080
But I thank you for the opportunity.
I really enjoy my job.

36:07.240 --> 36:08.000
I'm so sorry, Aisha.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.040
I'm so sorry, Aisha.

36:16.240 --> 36:19.400
Conor, I am being
transferred today...

36:19.440 --> 36:21.040
to Glentill.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.880
I'm going to miss you.

36:40.880 --> 36:42.520
Take care.

36:42.560 --> 36:45.160
Aisha, your taxi is outside.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.720
I'll take those.
Thanks.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.120
Take care of yourself.

37:08.480 --> 37:10.080
Aisha.

37:14.520 --> 37:16.560
I'll go down with you.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.000
Help you settle in.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.040
Help you settle in.

37:28.520 --> 37:30.560
Thank you for everything.

37:33.360 --> 37:34.680
What do you mean?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.600
I don't think our friendship
is a good idea.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.240
Why?

37:45.760 --> 37:47.560
I'm not what you need.

37:49.640 --> 37:51.040
I'm sorry.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.280
Hello.
Can I have your name, please.

38:50.320 --> 38:52.480
Aisha Osagie.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.000
"Insubordinate."

38:56.000 --> 38:56.560
"Insubordinate."

38:57.720 --> 38:59.520
Sorry?

38:59.560 --> 39:02.360
"Insubordinate."
That's what it says.

39:04.120 --> 39:06.000
That is not me.

39:06.040 --> 39:07.680
It has your name on it.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.000
Don't worry about it.

39:12.000 --> 39:12.160
Don't worry about it.

39:13.480 --> 39:15.880
Can I ask a question?
Of course.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.600
I have a work permit.

39:17.640 --> 39:20.000
Yeah, I'm afraid a work permit
is no use to you around here.

39:20.040 --> 39:22.040
We're out in the middle
of the country.

39:22.080 --> 39:24.280
You need a car to get a job.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.720
This is the one here, Aisha.

39:32.760 --> 39:36.000
So, if you can just hang on here,
I'll take your case.

39:36.000 --> 39:36.360
So, if you can just hang on here,
I'll take your case.

she's taking that bed.

39:49.200 --> 39:51.000
She doesn't say much. OK.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.000
You're very welcome, Aisha.

51:17.120 --> 51:19.080
Cans of beer, whatever.

51:19.120 --> 51:20.000
I had Valium to get to sleep.

51:20.000 --> 51:20.920
I had Valium to get to sleep.

51:21.720 --> 51:23.440
It was a merry-go-round.

51:27.120 --> 51:28.000
Why do you look so stressed?

51:28.000 --> 51:29.120
Why do you look so stressed?

54:10.640 --> 54:12.320
I-I tried ringing you.

54:13.360 --> 54:14.960

54:15.920 --> 54:16.000
I rang in sick this morning.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.560
I rang in sick this morning.

54:18.600 --> 54:20.400

54:21.600 --> 54:24.000
It's fine, but you
didn't have to do that.

54:24.000 --> 54:24.600
It's fine, but you
didn't have to do that.

54:25.680 --> 54:28.280
I know. I wanted to see you.

54:30.560 --> 54:32.000
It's not really allowed
to have guests.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.080
It's not really allowed
to have guests.

54:33.120 --> 54:36.040
I told him I'm from Carrig Nua.
He says I can go in.

54:42.240 --> 54:43.840

55:36.000 --> 55:36.680
I can't stop thinking about you.

55:39.640 --> 55:41.840

55:52.000 --> 55:53.320

55:58.600 --> 56:00.000

56:03.200 --> 56:05.400
My application was refused.

56:13.320 --> 56:14.920

56:21.920 --> 56:23.720
Are you alright?

56:37.880 --> 56:40.000

56:40.000 --> 56:40.280
I think about you a lot.

56:43.040 --> 56:46.240
Sometimes, I feel happy.

56:48.960 --> 56:51.760
And sometimes I feel really scared.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.520
I was thinking about what...

57:04.000 --> 57:06.200
..what you wanted to tell me.

57:18.960 --> 57:20.000
I can't be with you.

OK. You'll get to say

1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:12.040
Just remember, what they're looking
for is proof of "well founded fear,"

1:10:12.080 --> 1:10:15.280
so we need to put across
the danger that you're in.

1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:17.760
It would be great
if you happen to have

1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:20.800
more detail on
the attack on your home.

1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:24.000

Can he just stay for a little while?
He came all this way.

1:13:56.760 --> 1:13:58.520
He'd need to be cleared.

1:13:58.560 --> 1:14:00.000
I'm sorry, he'll have to leave now.

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:00.680

Aisha.

1:14:23.480 --> 1:14:24.000
Do you want to say what happened?

1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:25.480
Do you want to say what happened?

1:14:44.320 --> 1:14:46.400
Do you want to talk about it?

1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:51.560
No. I'm sorry.

1:14:53.800 --> 1:14:55.600
Yeah, so am I.

1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:10.760
I have to talk tomorrow.

1:15:16.200 --> 1:15:18.000
I'm not ready.

1:15:25.120 --> 1:15:27.040
Do you want me to go with you?

1:15:33.800 --> 1:15:35.400
OK.

1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:36.000
Yes.

1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:36.920
Yes.

1:16:42.040 --> 1:16:43.840
Come in.

1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:23.800
I just want to
lie down here with you.

1:17:27.560 --> 1:17:28.000
Is that OK?

1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:29.360
Is that OK?

1:17:31.840 --> 1:17:33.440
Yeah.

1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:30.000
Is this it?
Yeah.

1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:38.440
Do you want me to go and ask him?

1:18:38.480 --> 1:18:40.000
No, just wait.

1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:40.280
No, just wait.

1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:50.480
Aisha. Hello.
How are you? Good.

1:18:50.520 --> 1:18:52.160
Are you set? Yes. Right.

1:18:52.200 --> 1:18:54.240
This is Conor.
Hello, how are you?

1:18:54.280 --> 1:18:56.000
Grand. Nice to meet you.

1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:56.080
Grand. Nice to meet you.

1:18:56.120 --> 1:18:57.640
Now, you can't come in.
You know that?

1:18:57.680 --> 1:18:59.080
Yeah, fine.
OK.

1:18:59.120 --> 1:19:00.920
So, we'll-
Yeah, yeah.

1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:03.800
Alright, let's go. Great.

1:19:07.600 --> 1:19:11.920
With regard to the death
of Aisha's mother,

1:19:11.960 --> 1:19:12.000
Morayo Osagie,

1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:14.480
Morayo Osagie,

1:19:14.520 --> 1:19:16.720
we know from the authorities
in Benin City

1:19:16.760 --> 1:19:19.840
that she was murdered
just over three months ago.

1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:20.000
She was shot and killed in Lagos,

1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:22.840
She was shot and killed in Lagos,

1:19:22.880 --> 1:19:25.880
300 kilometres from Benin City.

1:19:25.920 --> 1:19:28.000
This terrible tragedy is
an indication of the level of danger

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:29.000
This terrible tragedy is
an indication of the level of danger

1:19:29.040 --> 1:19:31.160
that Aisha's in.

1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:35.600
We would argue that there's
a potential risk to her safety

1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:36.000
no matter where in the country
she may be.

1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:37.680
no matter where in the country
she may be.

1:19:39.080 --> 1:19:43.040
While the death of Ms. Osagie's
mother is, of course, tragic,

1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:44.000
the actual issue here relates to
the future risk to the applicant.

1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:47.480
the actual issue here relates to
the future risk to the applicant.

1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:52.000
Now, it's clear from the country
of origin information submitted

1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:52.160
Now, it's clear from the country
of origin information submitted

1:19:52.200 --> 1:19:55.600
that procedures are in place for
her protection should this applicant

1:19:55.640 --> 1:19:59.120
report her situation
to the authorities in Nigeria.

1:19:59.160 --> 1:20:00.000
We must remember that Refugee law
is intended to meet the needs

1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:01.720
We must remember that Refugee law
is intended to meet the needs

1:20:01.760 --> 1:20:04.560
of only those
who have no alternative.

1:20:04.600 --> 1:20:08.000
Primary recourse should always
be to one's own state.

1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:08.160
Primary recourse should always
be to one's own state.

1:20:11.400 --> 1:20:12.720
Ms. Osagie...

1:20:12.760 --> 1:20:15.960
would you like to tell us
a little bit more about your story?

1:20:17.200 --> 1:20:19.400
Yes, but it is not a story.

1:20:21.040 --> 1:20:23.240
It's not something
I've just made up.

1:20:24.680 --> 1:20:26.960
I don't have another alternative.

1:20:27.880 --> 1:20:30.120
A group of men came to my house.

1:20:30.160 --> 1:20:32.000
They asked my father
for the money that he owes them.

1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:33.120
They asked my father
for the money that he owes them.

1:20:33.160 --> 1:20:35.240
He borrowed it so he
can pay off my Uni fees

1:20:35.280 --> 1:20:38.200
and to help look after his family.

1:20:38.240 --> 1:20:40.000
He didn't have it

1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:40.440
He didn't have it

1:20:40.480 --> 1:20:43.320
so they shot my father
and my brother.

1:20:43.360 --> 1:20:45.200
And then they had their way with me.

1:20:46.160 --> 1:20:47.880
They raped me.

1:20:52.080 --> 1:20:54.160
So, this is not a story.

1:20:59.080 --> 1:21:01.080
Thank you, Ms. Osagie.

1:21:03.880 --> 1:21:04.000
I'm really disappointed...

1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:05.800
I'm really disappointed...

1:21:06.800 --> 1:21:09.600
that you'll make me wait
for two years

1:21:09.640 --> 1:21:12.000
before giving me
an answer to my case.

1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:12.080
before giving me
an answer to my case.

1:21:13.320 --> 1:21:16.360
I came here
not begging for anything.

1:21:16.400 --> 1:21:18.160
Just for safety.

1:21:18.200 --> 1:21:20.000
I don't want a handout
and I don't want anything for free.

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:21.880
I don't want a handout
and I don't want anything for free.

1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:24.080
I'm just here for safety.

1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:36.000
What did you tell them?

1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:36.680
What did you tell them?

1:21:41.800 --> 1:21:43.760
I told them what happened.

1:21:47.240 --> 1:21:48.760
All of it?

1:21:56.400 --> 1:21:59.080
May I have your attention please.

1:21:59.120 --> 1:22:00.000
Now boarding 18 south to Donegal.

1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:01.880
Now boarding 18 south to Donegal.

1:22:01.920 --> 1:22:04.200
It- It's my bus.

1:22:06.200 --> 1:22:07.880
Thank you for coming.

1:22:09.200 --> 1:22:11.000
Why don't you stay longer?

1:22:12.040 --> 1:22:14.240
I have to be back by ten.

1:22:14.280 --> 1:22:15.800
OK.

1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:16.000
See ya.
See you.

1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:17.520
See ya.
See you.

1:22:20.160 --> 1:22:21.640
Aisha...

1:22:23.400 --> 1:22:24.000
Can I kiss you?

1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:25.200
Can I kiss you?

1:22:30.240 --> 1:22:31.840
Yes.

1:22:39.080 --> 1:22:40.000
Bye.
See ya.

1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:40.880
Bye.
See ya.

1:23:15.520 --> 1:23:16.680
Hello.
Hi.

1:23:16.720 --> 1:23:18.840
I just want to check if I have post.

1:23:18.880 --> 1:23:20.000
Can I get your name?
Aisha Osagie.

1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:20.440
Can I get your name?
Aisha Osagie.

1:23:20.480 --> 1:23:22.080
I'll check for you now.

1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:30.960
There. Thank you.

1:24:33.680 --> 1:24:35.680
I don't have much time.

1:24:46.840 --> 1:24:48.000
Do you have the letter with you?

1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:48.880
Do you have the letter with you?

1:24:57.480 --> 1:24:59.480
My Ma's in.

1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:04.000
She wants to meet you.

1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:04.280
She wants to meet you.

1:25:04.320 --> 1:25:05.920
We don't have to.

1:25:08.440 --> 1:25:10.560
No. No, it's fine.

1:25:24.480 --> 1:25:28.000
Some of the reasons
given are not legally sound.

1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:28.120
Some of the reasons
given are not legally sound.

1:25:28.160 --> 1:25:30.400
We could challenge this
in the High Court.

1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:33.400
It'll take time.

1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:34.960
There's a backlog.

1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:39.520
And after that, what are my chances?

1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:44.000
Hard to say.

1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:45.440
Hard to say.

1:25:47.520 --> 1:25:49.680
It can go either way.
