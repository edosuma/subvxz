00:01.200 --> 00:03.000
This is your chance to
do something positive.

00:03.340 --> 00:04.760
That's what community
service is all about.

00:04.840 --> 00:06.161
What is going on with this weather?

00:06.512 --> 00:07.854
What is that?

00:12.517 --> 00:13.877
We should be dead.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.157
Something really weird is happening.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.522
Have you been sniffing glue?

00:19.557 --> 00:22.037
The storm, that lightning... I dunno,
it's done something to us.

00:23.438 --> 00:25.363
He's going to kill us.

00:25.398 --> 00:29.638
All this. It's already happened
once. Time went backwards.

00:29.673 --> 00:30.963
What... you turned back time?

00:30.998 --> 00:33.639
I want to rip your clothes off
and piss on your tits.

00:33.674 --> 00:35.439
Oh, what is happening to me?

00:36.639 --> 00:38.644
You killed our probation worker.

00:38.679 --> 00:41.445
If there's no body...
there's no crime.

00:41.480 --> 00:43.560
I'm pretty sure this breaches
the terms of my ASBO.

00:43.595 --> 00:45.845
What if we're meant to be like
superheroes?

00:45.880 --> 00:48.640
In what kind of fucked-up world
would that be allowed to happen?

00:53.561 --> 00:55.846
And what? Cos you're all special,
and I'm not?

00:55.881 --> 00:58.047
Yeah, well, I doubt it.
You can think what you like

00:58.082 --> 01:00.602
but I have a super power and I
just need to find out what it is.

01:00.637 --> 01:03.167
Maybe you're just super-retarded.

01:03.202 --> 01:05.206
Maybe I've got a whole
Spider-Man vibe going on.

01:05.241 --> 01:08.007
You know, maybe I can climb
stuff and do spider shit.

01:08.042 --> 01:11.442
Yeah, cos that makes perfect sense.
Why would you be able to climb stuff?

01:11.477 --> 01:14.322
I don't know. How is it that you
can turn back time, apparently?

01:14.357 --> 01:16.568
And weird kid can turn invisible?

01:16.603 --> 01:20.803
It's not like this whole situation
is backed up by a wank-load of logic.

www.feliratok.hu

02:17.849 --> 02:20.209
Is he breathing?

02:27.250 --> 02:28.930
Hey, nude guy!

02:28.965 --> 02:30.610
You're naked!

02:37.651 --> 02:39.451
You?!

02:48.131 --> 02:50.671
Do you want to tell us who that was?

02:50.706 --> 02:53.212
He's my mum's...
He lives with my mum.

02:54.852 --> 02:57.292
Your stepdad has got
a massive cock.

02:59.052 --> 03:01.058
Jesus!
And he's not my step-Dad, all right?

03:01.093 --> 03:04.933
Did you see that thing? That was
monster big. Your mum will hurt.

03:05.668 --> 03:06.373
Shut up!

03:06.408 --> 03:07.658
Why's he naked?

03:07.693 --> 03:10.894
Well, he's obviously some
kind of pervert or he's gay.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.019
That follows.

03:12.054 --> 03:14.654
Well, he was cruising for rough
trade. They love that shit.

03:14.689 --> 03:16.499
Oh, a little light homophobia.
Go for it.

03:16.534 --> 03:20.255
Or he could be a rapist.
There's loads of them round here.

03:20.290 --> 03:21.935
Maybe he's a werewolf.

03:21.970 --> 03:23.135
Twat.

03:24.735 --> 03:26.621
It's what happens in films.

03:26.656 --> 03:29.136
You turn into a werewolf,
you kill someone,

03:29.171 --> 03:32.176
then you wake-up somewhere, naked...

03:32.211 --> 03:33.861
like a zoo.

03:33.896 --> 03:38.056
He's not a werewolf, OK. This guy is such a
pussy, he needs my mum to open jars for him.

03:38.091 --> 03:41.696
If was a werewolf he'd be able to open
a jar of peanut butter for himself.

03:41.731 --> 03:44.697
What happens if the storm
messed him up?

03:44.732 --> 03:45.942
That's bollocks.

03:45.977 --> 03:48.177
What are the chances?

03:50.177 --> 03:54.418
Help out. Talk to them. Make sure
everyone's having a good time.

03:56.498 --> 03:58.858
Move!

04:13.700 --> 04:15.220
Is he dead?

04:17.860 --> 04:19.421
I think he's dead.

04:22.901 --> 04:25.820
She's stealing your pension!

04:25.855 --> 04:27.020
No, he's fine.

04:32.181 --> 04:34.541
'My mouth's as dry
as a badger's chuff.'

04:34.576 --> 04:36.982
D'you want a cup of tea?

04:43.902 --> 04:44.983
'Bugger me.'

04:52.583 --> 04:55.704
Perhaps you'd like
to dance with someone?

04:55.739 --> 04:57.029
You've got to be shitting me?

04:57.064 --> 05:00.064
No, Alisha. I am not "shitting you".

05:00.099 --> 05:02.145
Come on...

05:04.065 --> 05:05.985
Harry.

05:08.785 --> 05:11.706
Alisha was wondering if
you'd like to dance with her?

05:11.741 --> 05:12.826
It would be an honour.

05:18.625 --> 05:21.511
Let me taste your sweet cherry lips.

05:21.546 --> 05:26.226
I'd give my life to spend a night
between your dusky thighs.

05:26.261 --> 05:28.752
OK! Let's find you a chair.

05:28.787 --> 05:31.427
You go and help make tea.
Just keep out the way.

05:35.027 --> 05:36.752
OK, Joan.
Let's pick up some speed,

05:36.787 --> 05:38.833
let's get that wind
flowing through your hair.

05:38.868 --> 05:42.228
Let's get that wind flowing
through your scalp, come on.

05:42.263 --> 05:44.148
Hi.

05:56.070 --> 05:58.070
Hi.

05:59.510 --> 06:00.955
Thanks.

06:00.990 --> 06:03.030
So are you like a member
of staff or something?

06:03.065 --> 06:04.955
I'm a volunteer.

06:04.990 --> 06:07.515
Volunteer?! I love to volunteer.

06:07.550 --> 06:10.235
Is that why they gave
you community service?

06:10.270 --> 06:15.791
Could be, could be. I'd probably just
be here anyway you know, helping out.

06:15.826 --> 06:18.076
Old people.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.351
They're so...
they're so...

06:22.032 --> 06:25.112
They're old, you know.

06:28.152 --> 06:29.157
So what did you do?

06:29.192 --> 06:33.313
I sexually assaulted a
90-year-old woman.

06:33.348 --> 06:34.918
That's funny.

06:34.953 --> 06:37.873
She didn't seem to think
so at the time.

06:37.908 --> 06:40.354
God rest her soul.

06:40.389 --> 06:41.759
Jesus...

06:41.794 --> 06:46.034
No, no, the truth is... I was just
done for eating some pick 'n' mix.

06:46.069 --> 06:47.640
Right.

06:47.675 --> 06:49.840
Of course you were.

06:49.875 --> 06:52.195
Such a liar, pass me
those sausage rolls.

06:57.195 --> 07:00.315
I think she wants to dance with you.

07:00.350 --> 07:01.955
Oh, that's nice.

07:03.515 --> 07:04.756
(Fuck off.)

07:18.237 --> 07:20.042
Someone knows.

07:20.077 --> 07:22.358
They know we killed
our probation worker.

07:25.478 --> 07:28.398
Is this a wind up? Is this you?

07:30.038 --> 07:33.799
If I was trying to wind you up, I
think I'd be a little more creative.

07:33.834 --> 07:35.519
"I know what film
you saw last summer."

07:35.554 --> 07:37.284
This isn't funny?

07:37.319 --> 07:40.160
If I wanted to freak you out,
I would've dug up the body and

07:40.195 --> 07:41.917
stuck that in your locker.

07:41.952 --> 07:43.875
If it wasn't him, who was it?

07:43.910 --> 07:45.764
Well, we've all done stuff.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.760
They could be talking about anything.

07:47.795 --> 07:49.245
It was in your locker.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.520
This was meant for all of us.
They're talking about the probation worker.

07:52.555 --> 07:55.125
OK. Let's say you're right.

07:55.160 --> 07:58.181
If they actually knew anything,
they wouldn't be dicking around

07:58.216 --> 08:01.166
sticking notes on lockers.
They would've gone to the police.

08:01.201 --> 08:05.502
And we'd all be banged up in prison,
getting gang-raped in the showers.

08:05.537 --> 08:09.569
But this, this means that they
have no evidence. No proof. Nothing.

08:09.604 --> 08:13.602
And anyway, I'm guessing it's about
some other totally unrelated shit

08:13.637 --> 08:15.768
that you've done.

08:15.803 --> 08:20.283
So, if we're all done freaking out
here, over nothing,

08:20.318 --> 08:22.804
there's somewhere I need to be.

08:32.245 --> 08:35.089
Please tell me you don't
actually believe that prick?

08:35.124 --> 08:37.844
Well, whoever did it is just
trying to freak us out, right?

08:37.879 --> 08:39.604
So we just act normal.

09:00.241 --> 09:01.921
Did you get my messages?
I need to talk.

09:03.441 --> 09:04.846
You're not moving back in.

09:04.881 --> 09:08.282
It's not about that.
It's about Jeremy. No. Just listen.

09:08.317 --> 09:10.847
This morning,
I was doing my Community Service.

09:10.882 --> 09:14.002
We found Jeremy in the car-park.
He was bollock naked.

09:14.037 --> 09:15.260
Nathan!

09:15.295 --> 09:16.483
I swear.

09:18.003 --> 09:19.008
On my life.

09:19.043 --> 09:21.248
You're doing it again. You're lying.

09:21.283 --> 09:24.544
Right. How come I know
he's got a massive cock?

09:24.579 --> 09:27.891
How would I know that if
I hadn't seen him naked?

09:27.926 --> 09:31.169
I don't know! Maybe you
watched him taking a shower?

09:31.204 --> 09:34.045
Oh! Cos that sounds like the
sort of thing I'm doing now...

09:34.080 --> 09:35.285
watching men showering?

09:36.685 --> 09:40.444
Mum, he was out there, running
around, naked, like a wolf boy.

09:40.479 --> 09:41.970
What's a wolf boy?

09:42.005 --> 09:44.130
It's a boy, raised by wolves.

09:44.165 --> 09:46.445
You know,
the little hairy kid in Siberia.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.250
We watched it on Discovery.

09:48.285 --> 09:50.486
Why can't you just be happy for me?

09:51.966 --> 09:55.446
Because your boyfriend
is some kind of psycho,

09:55.481 --> 09:57.886
rough trade, gay, rapist werewolf!

10:01.047 --> 10:02.612
Every man I meet.

10:02.647 --> 10:05.132
There's always a reason
you take against them.

10:05.167 --> 10:08.848
It's like when you said
Richard was sexually abusing you.

10:08.883 --> 10:11.333
It's nothing like that. This is true.

10:11.368 --> 10:14.328
There is something weird
going on with Jeremy.

10:14.363 --> 10:17.209
Nathan! This conversation is over!

11:36.016 --> 11:36.976
(Hello?)

11:50.017 --> 11:52.378
Argh! What're you doing here?

11:52.413 --> 11:54.103
I left my bag.

11:54.138 --> 11:56.903
Oh, left your bag, did you?

11:56.938 --> 12:00.018
Of course you did. You sure
you didn't come back to see me?

12:01.059 --> 12:02.819
I didn't know you'd be here.

12:04.499 --> 12:05.864
Why are you here?

12:05.899 --> 12:11.859
I'm volunteering. I'm just giving
and giving and then I give some more.

12:11.894 --> 12:12.784
Is this a burglary?

12:12.819 --> 12:14.939
No. I could say the same to you.

12:16.579 --> 12:20.780
Except I've got keys to the building
and permission to be here.

12:23.060 --> 12:25.060
D'you want a drink?

12:37.142 --> 12:40.662
OK. So now it's a burglary.

13:43.788 --> 13:45.188
You all right?

13:51.188 --> 13:52.188
I want to get a photo.

14:34.393 --> 14:37.913
A naked man with a
huge cock just ran past.

14:37.948 --> 14:39.073
It's him!

14:39.108 --> 14:40.078
Who?

14:40.113 --> 14:41.398
It's my mum's...

14:41.433 --> 14:43.313
It's the guy who lives with my mum.

14:44.313 --> 14:45.953
Quick, give me your phone.

14:45.988 --> 14:46.954
Give me your phone.

15:08.196 --> 15:11.596
Did you really think I was going
to let you get away with this?

15:11.631 --> 15:13.957
That's my mum, you sick bastard!

15:17.677 --> 15:22.358
We can do this,
the hard way or the...

15:22.393 --> 15:24.398
there is no easy way.

15:24.433 --> 15:26.203
Game over.

15:26.238 --> 15:27.797
You're screwed.

15:37.038 --> 15:38.038
Jezza?

15:41.799 --> 15:46.599
Maybe we should talk about this?
Over a coffee?

16:00.361 --> 16:01.601
All right!

16:24.923 --> 16:27.323
You look like you had a good night.

16:27.358 --> 16:28.763
It was all right.

16:32.284 --> 16:34.244
Don't that tag
mean you've got a curfew?

16:35.884 --> 16:39.124
I'm not going to let a thing like
that stop me from enjoying myself.

16:41.965 --> 16:43.845
You should come out
with us sometime.

16:44.165 --> 16:45.730
I would you know, but

16:45.765 --> 16:49.166
my mum told me to stay
away from girls like you.

16:52.166 --> 16:54.726
Your mum has never
met a girl like me.

17:07.926 --> 17:09.092
It's him.

17:09.127 --> 17:10.887
It's the guy who lives with my mum.

17:10.922 --> 17:12.804
This is evidence.

17:12.839 --> 17:14.688
What am I looking at?

17:16.288 --> 17:20.008
Cock, anus, bit of ball-sack.

17:20.042 --> 17:21.093
Ooh, what's that?

17:21.127 --> 17:24.888
That's ball-sack. It's
from a low angle. Jesus!

17:26.969 --> 17:28.334
Where were you last night?

17:28.368 --> 17:30.969
'Oh, shit. She knows I'm a homeless.'

17:31.004 --> 17:31.930
Here, look.

17:32.970 --> 17:35.930
Cock, anus, ball-sack...yeah?

17:35.965 --> 17:37.087
What's that?

17:37.122 --> 17:38.175
That's cock.

17:38.210 --> 17:41.891
Look, this guy is living with my mum.
We've got to do something.

17:41.926 --> 17:42.636
Like what?

17:42.771 --> 17:43.776
Can you get me a gun?

17:43.811 --> 17:45.936
I ain't getting you a gun.

17:45.971 --> 17:48.496
C'mon. Just a little one.
Nothing too lairy.

17:48.531 --> 17:54.652
There's no way I'm getting
a dickhead like you a gun.

17:54.687 --> 17:56.616
You can get a gun off the internet.

17:56.651 --> 17:58.977
What if we go round there tonight...
talk to him?

17:59.012 --> 18:03.332
We'll be mature and polite, yeah? And
then we'll just tell him to fuck off.

18:03.367 --> 18:04.292
What if he says no?

18:05.932 --> 18:08.533
I don't know. We'll improvise.
So, who's with me?

18:15.333 --> 18:16.939
It's like that, is it?

18:16.974 --> 18:21.374
So much for being united
by a horrific, life changing,

18:21.409 --> 18:23.054
shared experience.

18:24.855 --> 18:26.780
Hmm? Last week?

18:26.815 --> 18:29.015
You know? The situation...

18:31.975 --> 18:34.016
We killed our probation worker!

18:36.936 --> 18:38.656
God, you're such a dickhead.

18:38.691 --> 18:40.376
That counts for nothing?

18:40.411 --> 18:42.074
(Fucking prick.)

18:42.109 --> 18:43.737
I'll come with you.

18:45.417 --> 18:49.096
You know, if you want someone
to go with you. I'll come.

18:49.131 --> 18:52.377
I'm not being funny but,
me and you, buddying up...

18:52.412 --> 18:54.702
kicking ass!

18:54.737 --> 18:56.817
I'm just not feeling it, but, hey.

18:56.852 --> 18:58.857
Lovely thought. Cheers.

19:59.543 --> 20:00.624
Did that hurt?

20:02.504 --> 20:03.909
Yeah, hurt like a bastard.

20:03.944 --> 20:06.144
I only got it done
cos my fiance wanted it.

20:06.179 --> 20:07.149
Are you engaged?

20:07.184 --> 20:10.025
I was. I'm not any more.

20:10.060 --> 20:11.190
Why, what happened?

20:11.225 --> 20:13.485
I could hear what
he was thinking, yeah?

20:13.520 --> 20:15.745
And he wasn't exactly
being romantic.

20:19.306 --> 20:22.226
Have you been with anyone
since you could do your thing?

20:22.261 --> 20:24.226
No, not full on.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.986
I've tried it out,
just for a second.

20:29.266 --> 20:31.511
They were proper horny.

20:31.546 --> 20:33.286
One was quite fit, actually.

20:33.321 --> 20:35.026
Have you shagged anyone?

20:36.067 --> 20:37.067
What d'you think?

21:14.511 --> 21:15.515
Nathan?

21:15.550 --> 21:20.491
That's right. Your number's up,
you psycho nudist freak.

21:20.526 --> 21:25.431
Oh, I got you now, baby.
See anything you recognise?

21:25.466 --> 21:26.951
What am I looking at?

21:29.672 --> 21:32.432
Cock, anus, ball-sack.

21:32.467 --> 21:33.477
Is it?

21:33.512 --> 21:36.593
It's from a low angle.
It's you... last night.

21:38.633 --> 21:41.513
George Michael gets away with this,
but he was in Wham. Who are you?

21:43.393 --> 21:45.074
I don't remember what happened.

21:45.109 --> 21:46.999
Oh, how very convenient.

21:47.034 --> 21:50.634
This happened. I show this
to my mum, you're history.

21:50.669 --> 21:54.635
So just...take your crappy shit.

21:55.955 --> 21:57.635
And go.

21:59.915 --> 22:00.875
That's your mum's.

22:03.076 --> 22:04.281
I'll buy her a new one,

22:04.316 --> 22:06.120
That's what sons do for mums.

22:06.155 --> 22:09.935
Look, don't make this any
harder on her. Just go!

22:09.970 --> 22:13.716
No, you go. Your Mum
doesn't even want you here.

22:13.751 --> 22:14.836
You prick!

22:16.116 --> 22:17.481
Nathan!

22:17.516 --> 22:18.936
What are you doing!?

22:18.971 --> 22:20.322
You made me do this!

22:20.357 --> 22:23.357
You wouldn't listen!
That psycho was out last night.

22:23.392 --> 22:26.157
Tell her you sick bastard. Tell her!

22:26.192 --> 22:27.837
He already told me.

22:27.872 --> 22:29.398
He told you?

22:31.118 --> 22:32.883
So, what the fuck?

22:32.918 --> 22:35.438
It started after that storm.

22:35.473 --> 22:36.798
It did something to me.

22:38.999 --> 22:40.479
Sometimes it's like I'm a dog.

22:42.919 --> 22:43.964
When I was a kid,

22:43.999 --> 22:47.880
we had this Jack Russell, Billy.
We did everything together.

22:49.360 --> 22:50.365
That's weird.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.880
He was my best friend.

22:51.915 --> 22:53.360
That's really weird.

22:54.479 --> 22:56.540
Whenever I see a Jack Russell, it...

22:56.575 --> 22:58.565
it brings back all these feelings.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.800
And next thing I know,
I'm waking up, naked.

23:01.835 --> 23:03.526
It's true.

23:03.561 --> 23:05.646
I didn't believe it at first.

23:05.681 --> 23:08.441
But I've seen what he's
like when he changes.

23:08.476 --> 23:12.002
Just...are you honestly telling me,

23:12.037 --> 23:13.882
that you're OK with this?

23:13.917 --> 23:16.039
If that's who he is.

23:16.074 --> 23:18.127
I've got to accept it.

23:18.162 --> 23:20.863
Some men dress up in
women's clothing...

23:20.898 --> 23:23.563
They're just sick perverts.
He's dangerous.

23:23.598 --> 23:25.003
I would never hurt your mum.

23:26.403 --> 23:27.363
I love her.

23:29.964 --> 23:31.249
You've broken his nose!

23:31.284 --> 23:34.764
Oh... It's not like you can
enter him in Crufts.

23:57.660 --> 23:59.740
I got your address from
the community centre.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.460
I just thought you might
want your phone back.

24:07.941 --> 24:11.861
Oh, there's probably a photo
on there you want to delete.

24:11.896 --> 24:13.942
It's just a...

24:14.302 --> 24:16.582
It's a shot of some ball-sack.

24:18.702 --> 24:20.307
Anyway, just,

24:20.342 --> 24:22.623
I'll see you around.

24:24.183 --> 24:25.703
Are you OK?

24:32.784 --> 24:35.629
She's never hit me before...

24:35.664 --> 24:37.744
not even a smack when I was a kid.

24:39.545 --> 24:41.989
What d'you want from her?

24:42.024 --> 24:43.904
Would you be happier
if she was on her own?

24:43.939 --> 24:44.949
Yeah.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.024
But it's horrible being on your own.

24:47.059 --> 24:48.865
You want her to be miserable?

24:51.585 --> 24:54.145
You don't want your mum
to have anyone in her life

24:54.180 --> 24:56.270
because that means
she's not there for you.

24:56.305 --> 25:00.426
Don't try that reverse psychology
A-level bullshit on me. I'm fine.

25:00.461 --> 25:02.511
Oh, yeah.

25:02.546 --> 25:05.146
You're living in a community centre.
You're doing great.

25:09.587 --> 25:13.267
The only thing worse
than being lonely,

25:13.302 --> 25:16.948
is other people
knowing you're lonely.

25:18.548 --> 25:20.668
No-one wants to look like a cunt.

25:25.149 --> 25:29.629
You can't give your mum
everything she needs.

25:29.664 --> 25:32.509
Don't be so selfish.

25:32.544 --> 25:33.829
Grow up.

25:35.749 --> 25:38.429
What's that supposed to mean?

25:41.430 --> 25:42.670
D'you want a drink?

25:42.705 --> 25:44.190
Yeah.

25:56.031 --> 25:58.552
Whose house is this?

25:58.587 --> 26:00.957
It's my Gran's.

26:00.992 --> 26:02.512
I'm staying with her.

26:14.993 --> 26:17.194
Is sherry OK?

26:31.154 --> 26:33.760
So what happened to you?

26:33.795 --> 26:37.040
I came back last night
and you were gone.

26:37.075 --> 26:40.915
You seemed more interested
in chasing a naked man

26:40.950 --> 26:42.356
around the car park.

26:46.556 --> 26:48.796
So what would've happened
if I hadn't gone

26:48.831 --> 26:51.037
chasing a naked man
around the car park?

26:52.957 --> 26:56.162
I'm guessing,

26:56.197 --> 26:59.038
you would have had
some pretty amazing sex.

27:02.518 --> 27:04.278
Really?

27:04.313 --> 27:06.038
Oh, yeah.

27:28.072 --> 27:29.320
Your gran's not here, is she?

27:29.355 --> 27:30.405
No.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.489
Well, that's embarrassing.

29:09.730 --> 29:12.450
Oh, come on! It's been a while, OK?

29:12.485 --> 29:15.170
How about a little sensitivity?

29:15.205 --> 29:17.095
It's not that.

29:17.130 --> 29:20.531
Do you always pull that face
when you have an orgasm?

29:22.131 --> 29:24.931
What is wrong with my cum face?

29:24.966 --> 29:26.451
It's really bad.

29:32.732 --> 29:34.212
Well, I'll work on it.

29:37.733 --> 29:39.613
D'you want to try again?

29:41.212 --> 29:42.672
I'm here.

29:42.707 --> 29:44.097
You're here.

29:44.132 --> 29:47.773
We're both naked,
consenting adults...

30:11.496 --> 30:14.176
"Hello? Hello, can I help?"

30:15.336 --> 30:17.616
"Is everything OK?
Do you need any help?"

30:21.057 --> 30:22.557
I'm coming!

30:24.079 --> 30:25.628
Oh, fuck!

30:39.258 --> 30:40.618
Are you ok?

30:42.898 --> 30:46.019
Well, you were...
What the fuck...

30:46.054 --> 30:47.816
What was that thing?

30:47.851 --> 30:49.579
It was the storm.

30:51.179 --> 30:53.779
I just wanted to be young again.

30:53.814 --> 30:56.345
You complain about my cum face.

30:56.380 --> 30:59.820
You should see yours, love.
Trust me. It's a shocker.

30:59.855 --> 31:02.140
Do we have to talk about this
through the door?

31:05.021 --> 31:07.186
OK.

31:07.221 --> 31:09.301
I'm coming out.
Move away from the door.

31:09.336 --> 31:11.141
Back off, Back off!

31:22.582 --> 31:24.822
Exactly how old are you?

31:24.857 --> 31:26.582
82.

31:27.702 --> 31:29.263
83 next month.

31:30.743 --> 31:33.668
I didn't mean for this to happen.

31:33.703 --> 31:37.263
It felt so good to be young again
and I liked you.

31:37.298 --> 31:39.629
I shagged someone's gran.

31:39.664 --> 31:41.309
I haven't got any grandchildren.

31:41.344 --> 31:44.904
Oh, that's OK then, cos that
could have been really awkward.

31:44.939 --> 31:46.149
I'm sorry.

31:46.184 --> 31:48.705
You're sorry?
I'm gonna need counselling now.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.230
I'm damaged goods.

31:51.265 --> 31:53.305
Where are my boxer shorts?

31:53.340 --> 31:54.870
Oh, c'mon. Don't go.

31:54.905 --> 31:58.426
I'm not waiting around for Granny
Fuck Me to make another appearance.

32:04.587 --> 32:07.947
Something's wrong.
I'm changing back.

32:08.987 --> 32:11.266
I think I'm growing old again.

32:11.301 --> 32:12.907
I'm scared.

32:25.403 --> 32:28.088
This is the fifth time
you've broken your curfew.

32:28.123 --> 32:30.404
What's the problem?
You can't go out any time you want.

32:30.439 --> 32:32.684
It was my friend's birthday.
What was I supposed to do?

32:32.719 --> 32:33.689
Is that a joke?

32:33.724 --> 32:34.969
D'you see me laughing?

32:35.004 --> 32:37.243
I'm arresting you for
breaching the terms of your ASBO.

32:37.278 --> 32:40.009
Oh, you're not serious?

32:40.044 --> 32:45.164
Oh, I want you so bad, I need
your lovin', you sexy little minx.

32:45.199 --> 32:46.609
Shit! Let go of me!

32:46.644 --> 32:48.325
Let's do it on the desk.

32:48.360 --> 32:50.090
Get off me!

32:50.125 --> 32:54.045
I'm so hard for you. That's five
and a half inches of pure pleasure.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.090
Oh, yeah...

32:55.125 --> 32:57.246
Fuck off! Get off me, you pervert!

33:03.606 --> 33:05.647
I have no idea why that's out.

33:12.167 --> 33:13.607
Are you OK?

33:15.608 --> 33:19.968
I'll sort all this out for you.
If you want to make a complaint,

33:20.003 --> 33:21.533
I'll back you up.

33:21.568 --> 33:23.649
I just want to forget it.

33:26.648 --> 33:30.328
You seem to have
quite an effect on men.

33:30.363 --> 33:32.654
You're a very beautiful girl.

33:32.689 --> 33:36.849
It's not my fault if they can't
keep their dicks in their trousers.

33:41.050 --> 33:43.575
I am here.

33:43.610 --> 33:46.290
You know,
if anything like that happens,

33:46.325 --> 33:48.976
or if you're worried about anything.

33:49.011 --> 33:51.651
You can talk to me.
I'll give you my mobile number.

33:51.686 --> 33:52.811
No, you're all right.

35:32.900 --> 35:34.586
Hey what happened to you?

35:34.621 --> 35:37.901
I will not be in a room
where that song is playing.

35:37.936 --> 35:40.826
Line in the sand, my friend.

35:40.861 --> 35:42.787
Some old woman was looking for you.

35:42.822 --> 35:45.662
'What if Ruth's told
someone I had sex with her?

35:45.697 --> 35:48.502
'Oh, shit. No, no, no, no, no...'

35:48.537 --> 35:51.628
You shagged her!

35:51.663 --> 35:55.422
Yeah. Yeah, nice one.
I gave her a right good seeing to.

35:58.142 --> 35:59.983
You totally screwed her.

36:00.018 --> 36:01.703
No.

36:02.543 --> 36:04.028
No!

36:04.063 --> 36:06.943
You nailed that old woman?
Nah, that is wrong.

36:06.978 --> 36:08.149
Oh, my God.

36:08.184 --> 36:09.309
Did you enjoy it?

36:09.344 --> 36:10.444
Shut up, you little freak.

36:10.479 --> 36:11.551
I think he enjoyed it.

36:11.586 --> 36:12.624
Are you into that?

36:12.659 --> 36:14.029
No!

36:14.064 --> 36:17.470
She didn't look
like that when we started, OK?

36:17.505 --> 36:20.585
You remember that bird Ruth,
from Tuesday? Beautiful, yeah?

36:20.620 --> 36:24.270
That wrinkly old bint...that's her!

36:24.305 --> 36:26.346
It was the storm.
It made her young again.

36:26.381 --> 36:29.986
Please, please tell me you didn't...

36:32.226 --> 36:33.506
He did!

36:35.507 --> 36:39.467
He did! God's sake!

36:43.428 --> 36:46.787
Nathan, Nathan wait, look I didn't
mean to tell them. It just came out.

36:46.822 --> 36:49.667
Oh, well great job. Nice one.

36:49.702 --> 36:51.107
Well done.

36:52.948 --> 36:55.348
And stay out of my head, OK?

36:55.383 --> 36:56.748
Granny fucker!

38:38.838 --> 38:40.598
Hello?

38:59.160 --> 39:00.440
Ruth?

39:19.401 --> 39:20.602
Ruth.

39:23.682 --> 39:25.802
Oh, Jesus, no.

40:26.888 --> 40:28.768
You little tart.

41:05.727 --> 41:07.377
I'm sorry.

41:59.177 --> 42:02.777
So I suppose you're going
to tell me you love him?

42:05.337 --> 42:07.778
But it doesn't
change how I feel about you.

42:11.018 --> 42:16.024
I'm... I'm so sorry I hit you.

42:16.059 --> 42:18.544
I... I punched the guy you live with.

42:18.579 --> 42:23.620
Your, you...
I can't call him your "boyfriend",

42:23.655 --> 42:25.557
or your "partner", it's too pathetic.

42:25.592 --> 42:27.460
You can call him Dad, if you like.

42:27.495 --> 42:29.300
Oh, that's funny.

42:32.341 --> 42:34.260
I've been worried about you.

42:34.295 --> 42:35.460
Where're you living?

42:37.300 --> 42:38.840
I've got a flat...

42:38.875 --> 42:40.380
with some friends...

42:40.415 --> 42:43.066
flatmates.

42:43.101 --> 42:45.426
If you try to get on with Jeremy,

42:45.461 --> 42:50.462
I mean, really try,
well, maybe you could move back in.

42:50.497 --> 42:53.227
I'm not being funny,
a woman your age...

42:53.262 --> 42:56.622
If you don't settle down before your
looks go, you've got no chance.

42:56.657 --> 42:57.707
Oh, thank you.

42:57.742 --> 43:00.148
I can't be looking after you
when you're 80.

43:00.183 --> 43:04.503
You'll be phoning me every time
you want to change the TV channel.

43:04.538 --> 43:05.668
No, too painful.

43:05.703 --> 43:08.624
I've got my flat.
It's better for all of us.

43:14.064 --> 43:16.305
Come round for your tea sometimes?

43:16.340 --> 43:18.545
Yeah...

43:20.785 --> 43:22.265
See you, then.

43:31.705 --> 43:35.626
If you ever hurt her, I'll take you
up the vets and have you put down.

43:45.587 --> 43:47.352
I told you there'd be other people

43:47.387 --> 43:50.107
who got messed up by the storm.
And you didn't believe me.

43:50.142 --> 43:53.073
Yeah, well, I was wrong, wasn't I?

43:53.108 --> 43:55.828
There's a hurricane
of weird shit out there.

43:57.308 --> 44:00.349
Oh, another oral sex gag. Brilliant.

44:03.749 --> 44:06.309
We need to be ready for
when they come after us.

44:06.344 --> 44:07.594
What're you talking about?

44:07.629 --> 44:10.310
The other people, who got
caught up in the storm.

44:10.345 --> 44:12.707
Why would they come after us?

44:12.742 --> 44:15.034
Because that's what people do.

44:15.069 --> 44:20.350
Yeah, well, if they do, we'll just
tell them it was all your fault.

44:26.591 --> 44:30.876
You know that note
you found in your locker?

44:30.911 --> 44:33.791
I think it was talking
about the probation worker.

44:40.272 --> 44:41.712
Holy shit.

45:02.634 --> 45:05.314
I've got a power. I know it.
I can feel it in my balls.

45:05.349 --> 45:06.754
I know you want to.

45:06.789 --> 45:07.699
Don't.

45:10.035 --> 45:11.415
You can't be doing that to people.

45:11.450 --> 45:13.075
Trust me, you enjoyed it.

45:17.355 --> 45:20.236
Tony's alive. He used his
credit card to book a flight.

45:20.271 --> 45:22.253
No, it's not him. It can't be.

45:22.288 --> 45:24.201
We're a bunch of young offenders.

45:24.236 --> 45:25.916
Not one of us knows
how to steal a car?

45:25.951 --> 45:27.797
No, no, no...

45:30.477 --> 45:32.197
They're going to dig up the bodies!

45:32.232 --> 45:34.797
We need to move them.

45:35.305 --> 45:41.508
