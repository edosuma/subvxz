Ah, Valentine's Day's
coming up

00:23.300 --> 00:26.934

a big old Valentine's card.

00:26.934 --> 00:28.967
Sorry, Daddy, it's for Devon.

Um, he's visiting
his grandma in L.A.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.100

to send him a little card

Hey, no problem.

All he needs is a couple

is to believe,

09:03.367 --> 09:04.834
Uh-huh.

09:04.834 --> 09:06.467
Just mail the card.

09:06.467 --> 09:08.133
And clean your room.

09:08.133 --> 09:10.100
Yes, ma'am.

09:17.967 --> 09:19.967

09:19.967 --> 09:22.834
tomorrow's Valentine's Day.

09:22.834 --> 09:27.400
Or as I like to call it,
"Coreytine's Day."

09:47.300 --> 09:48.667
Okay, so which one

09:48.667 --> 09:50.967
of those beautiful
ladies was Danielle?

09:50.967 --> 09:52.300
None of them.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.000
She's old news.

09:56.734 --> 09:58.033
What happened?

09:58.033 --> 09:59.967
I thought she was going
to be your special valentine.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.867
Who needs one girl
when you can have ten?

10:02.867 --> 10:05.734
It's a numbers
game, baby.

10:05.734 --> 10:07.567
Ha.

10:07.567 --> 10:09.734
Wow, looks like
Corey's a little
full of himself.

10:10.934 --> 10:14.000
He's a little
full of something.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.767
I thought you were
gonna mail that thing.

10:28.967 --> 10:31.400
The mailman refused to take it.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.300
Well, maybe you need
a smaller card.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.467
Or a bigger mailman.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.200
Don't you have to
call Curtis, Chel?

10:37.200 --> 10:38.400
Ooh, right, I have to tell him

10:38.400 --> 10:39.967
to come over tomorrow,
meet your parents.

10:39.967 --> 10:41.200
Man, I hope this goes well.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.100
I feel like Curtis and I
are, like, soul mates.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.233
You know, just think,
one day I might be

10:45.233 --> 10:48.000
Mrs. Curtis...

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Yeah, what the heck's
that guy's last name again?

go to my room.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.734
(<i>sighs </i>)

10:56.734 --> 10:58.467
Hey, Eddie,
we got to talk about Corey.

10:58.467 --> 10:59.667
I'm kind of worried about him.

10:59.667 --> 11:00.867
Why? He's doing great.

11:00.867 --> 11:02.200
I just wrote him a new rhyme.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.400
What?

11:04.400 --> 11:06.500
You know, just following up
the first hit,

11:06.500 --> 11:07.734
passing down the magic.

11:07.734 --> 11:10.000
Um... listen,
I know I asked you to help,

11:10.000 --> 11:11.667
but Corey's changed.

11:11.667 --> 11:12.734
I mean,
he's obnoxious,

11:12.734 --> 11:17.300
self-centered, conceited...

11:17.300 --> 11:20.300
He hasn't really changed
that much.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.600
But now the girls
are actually falling for it.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.967
Rae, it every guy's dream

11:23.967 --> 11:27.033
to have a whole bunch
of girls chasing them.

11:27.033 --> 11:30.000
Don't kill the boy's dreams,
that's all I'm saying.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.100
Yeah, he was kind
of glowing.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.400
Look at this way, Rae.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.500
Your vision of Corey
not getting any valentines

11:35.500 --> 11:36.600
ain't gonna happen.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.900
Maybe you're right.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.967
(<i>doorbell rings </i>)

11:39.967 --> 11:41.300
I got to get that.
And you know what?

11:41.300 --> 11:42.667
I don't care what they
say about you, Eddie.

11:42.667 --> 11:43.600
You're the best.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.300
The best?

11:45.300 --> 11:48.934
Well, thank you, Rae.

11:48.934 --> 11:51.967
Well, who keeps saying
these things?

11:54.033 --> 11:55.600
Hey there.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.100
Hi, I'm Danielle.

11:57.100 --> 11:59.700
I just wanted to drop off
my valentine for Corey.

11:59.700 --> 12:02.400
Oh, that is so sweet.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.200
(<i>yelling </i>):
Corey!

12:04.200 --> 12:07.400
Come on in,
he'll be right down.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.200
I tried giving him my card
in school,

12:11.200 --> 12:14.667
but he was kind of busy
with all the other girls.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.200
Oh, well...

12:16.200 --> 12:18.200
I'm sure he'd love
to see you now.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.500
And don't take it personally,
Danielle, seriously,

12:21.500 --> 12:23.233
because guys
have this crazy dream

12:23.233 --> 12:25.233
about lots of girls
chasing after them.

12:25.233 --> 12:27.133
They do?

12:27.133 --> 12:31.300
Why can't they
just like one girl?

12:31.300 --> 12:33.900
You know what? They can.

12:33.900 --> 12:35.300
They should.
That dream is stupid,

12:35.300 --> 12:36.500
because it hurts people,

12:36.500 --> 12:38.367
especially cute little people
in pigtails.

12:38.367 --> 12:39.934
Oh, those are so cute.

Corey!

12:43.467 --> 12:45.100
What?

12:45.100 --> 12:47.934

to give you this valentine.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.200
Not until tomorrow.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.700

No, seriously.

13:13.467 --> 13:14.967
"Take a number," Corey?

That is no way to treat anybody.

13:16.767 --> 13:18.233

to get through to you?

13:18.233 --> 13:20.600
Whatever it is, take a number.
You can tell me about it later.

13:26.667 --> 13:28.300
Hey, you guys,
Curtis is here.

13:28.300 --> 13:31.300
Thank you so much again
for filling in for my parents.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.200
You know, Victor,

13:34.200 --> 13:35.500
this is a big responsibility.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.400
You heard what
Chelsea said earlier

13:37.400 --> 13:38.600
about you being too soft.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.033
Oh, please,
she was talking about you.

13:41.033 --> 13:42.400
Of course she was.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.400
Now put away your cream puffs

13:44.400 --> 13:46.100
and let's talk
to the boy.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.567
Guys, are you ready?

13:48.567 --> 13:50.100
Ooh, there's a tough question.

13:50.100 --> 13:52.367
Um, Curtis,
this are Raven's parents.

13:52.367 --> 13:54.200
They actually have
some questions for you.

13:54.200 --> 13:57.500
But don't worry,
it's just a formality thing.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.934
Take a seat, Curtis.

13:59.934 --> 14:01.400
So...

14:01.400 --> 14:03.033
how are you doing in school?

14:03.033 --> 14:04.867
Oh, he's shaking now.

Actually, Curtis is
a straight-A student.

14:06.867 --> 14:08.100
Really?

14:08.100 --> 14:09.200
You a cheater?

14:09.200 --> 14:11.300
Uh... I've never
cheated in my life.

14:11.300 --> 14:12.800
Ever been in jail?

14:12.800 --> 14:14.734
What? No.

14:14.734 --> 14:16.500
Why not?

14:16.500 --> 14:18.233
Because I'm not
a criminal.

14:18.233 --> 14:19.467
Okay...

Come here.

Hi, yeah, come here.
Hi. Hello.

14:22.867 --> 14:26.000
I kind of like this guy.
Kind of.

Honey, we're just doing
our jobs.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.667
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey.

14:29.667 --> 14:32.033
You're on a date
with Chelsea and
the car breaks down.

14:32.033 --> 14:33.100
What do you do?

14:33.100 --> 14:35.600
Uh... I don't have
a license, sir.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.700
Aha!

14:36.700 --> 14:38.300
Driving without
a license.

14:38.300 --> 14:40.100
What were you
thinking, young man?

14:40.100 --> 14:42.300
And you getting in the car
with him.

14:43.367 --> 14:44.500
Chelsea, I'm sorry.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.400
I like you, but this
is just too weird.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.000
Um... uh, uh, Curtis...
can you wait a minute?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.700
Is that a trick question?

14:51.700 --> 14:52.900
No.

Look, I think we got
a little carried away.

14:54.500 --> 14:55.600
I'm sorry.

Look, you seem like
a very nice young man.

Look, you two go out and
have a nice time on us.

15:03.934 --> 15:05.300
Here's ten bucks.
Ten bucks?

15:05.300 --> 15:08.033
You can't do anything
with ten bucks.

15:08.033 --> 15:09.600
Here's $20.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.200
Please.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.900

18:45.100 --> 18:46.967
Why did you do that?

18:46.967 --> 18:48.367
I know it's hard to believe,

18:48.367 --> 18:51.600
but it was the only way
I could think of to help you.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.867
Well, thanks for the help.

18:53.867 --> 18:55.967
I had all those girls
in love with me

18:55.967 --> 18:57.367
and you had to ruin it.

18:57.367 --> 18:59.834
Corey, those girls were not
in love with you, okay?

18:59.834 --> 19:01.300
They were in love
with your rap,

19:01.300 --> 19:03.500
which wasn't even yours.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.667
So what?

19:04.667 --> 19:06.233
I didn't hurt anybody.

19:06.233 --> 19:08.000
You didn't?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.734
Well, what about Danielle?

19:09.734 --> 19:11.000
"Take a number"?

19:11.000 --> 19:13.967
Oh, yeah.
I guess you're right.

19:13.967 --> 19:15.934
I should've given her
a lower number, huh?

19:15.934 --> 19:16.900
Corey...

19:16.900 --> 19:20.033
I get what you're saying.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.767
That wasn't cool.

19:21.767 --> 19:25.133
There may be hope for you yet.

19:25.133 --> 19:26.600
Oh.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.667
Danielle wanted me
to give you this.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.300
She was the only girl
that really liked me

19:35.300 --> 19:37.233
and I blew it.

19:37.233 --> 19:39.300
Uh, well...

19:39.300 --> 19:40.600
you still have a rose.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.467
What am I supposed
to do with it?

19:43.467 --> 19:45.834
Let's go get
you a vase.

19:51.500 --> 19:52.800
Hello, Corey.

19:52.800 --> 19:57.000
(<i>stammering </i>):
Hmm... hmm... hmm...

19:57.000 --> 19:59.834
Danielle, translated,
that means,

19:59.834 --> 20:02.300
"I'm sorry I was
a real jerk.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.100
Will you be
my valentine?"

20:05.767 --> 20:08.100
Corey, is that true?

20:11.500 --> 20:13.867
Okay, Corey.
I'll be your valentine.

20:14.900 --> 20:16.033
You will?!

20:16.033 --> 20:17.500
That's great!

20:17.500 --> 20:20.000
I'm talking to you.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.734
Did you like my card?

20:21.734 --> 20:23.300
Yeah, I liked
the little hearts.

20:23.300 --> 20:25.934
Some people make them lumpy,
but yours were perfect.

20:25.934 --> 20:28.367
Thanks.
I don't like lumpy hearts.

20:28.367 --> 20:29.200
Me, too.

20:29.200 --> 20:32.400
(<i>cries </i>):
Oh!

20:35.667 --> 20:37.500
Oh.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.734
I get you.
You want me to go.

20:39.734 --> 20:40.867
Sorry.

20:40.867 --> 20:44.967
Cupid was just
admiring her work.

20:44.967 --> 20:47.467
(<i>sighs </i>)

20:49.600 --> 20:50.867
But she can take a hint.

20:50.867 --> 20:52.200
Bye.

21:02.100 --> 21:03.500
(<i>doorbell rings </i>)

21:05.900 --> 21:07.400
(<i>gasps </i>):
Oh!

21:07.400 --> 21:08.400
Oh!

21:08.400 --> 21:09.767
What's up, Rae?
Hi.

21:09.767 --> 21:11.367
You weren't supposed to
be back until tomorrow.

21:11.367 --> 21:13.967
Not that a sister's
complaining.

21:13.967 --> 21:15.834
I made my parents so crazy
talking about you,

21:15.834 --> 21:16.967
we drove home a day early.

21:16.967 --> 21:18.133
Oh.

21:18.133 --> 21:19.600
Happy Valentine's Day.

21:19.600 --> 21:20.834
Thank you, Devon.

21:20.834 --> 21:22.367
Oh, they're so beautiful.

21:22.367 --> 21:24.834
Oh, and I got
something for you.

21:31.300 --> 21:33.300

21:33.300 --> 21:36.033

21:50.000 --> 21:51.300
Well...

21:51.300 --> 21:54.100
it's the thought
that counts, right?

21:54.100 --> 21:56.133
Happy Valentine's Day.
