he's my teacher.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.844
{\an1}Well, first,
we have story time!

Oh! Story time!
I have just the thing!

07:31.150 --> 07:33.352
(kids giggle,
chicken clucks)

07:34.320 --> 07:38.090

07:40.293 --> 07:42.695
Let's just see
what else we have.

07:44.363 --> 07:46.699
How about one
of these things?

07:48.901 --> 07:50.303
I need your help.

07:50.369 --> 07:54.207
At story time,
will I write in a note pad,

07:54.273 --> 07:55.942
draw with crayons,

07:56.008 --> 07:57.343
or read a book?

08:01.147 --> 08:02.515
LITTLE FISH:
Read a book!

08:02.582 --> 08:04.016
That's right!

I can pick my favorite book
to read at story time!

08:06.919 --> 08:09.589
Right on!
What happens next?

08:09.655 --> 08:12.191
The next part of our routine
is lunchtime,

08:12.258 --> 08:14.694
so I need something
to carry food in.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.363
Lunchtime? Yum!

08:17.430 --> 08:19.332
I have just the thing!

08:19.398 --> 08:23.236
You can carry your food
in one of these.

08:24.503 --> 08:28.140
To carry my food,
should I use pots,

08:28.207 --> 08:29.809
the lunch box,

08:29.876 --> 08:31.544
or the kettle?

08:34.614 --> 08:36.148

Lunch box!

08:36.215 --> 08:39.184

to carry my lunch,

08:39.251 --> 08:40.586
and a snack too!

08:42.087 --> 08:45.591
What else is
in your "routine"?

08:45.658 --> 08:48.828
The next thing we do is
go outside for recess.

08:48.895 --> 08:50.229
Then you'll need
to wear something

08:50.296 --> 08:51.230
to keep you warm,

08:51.297 --> 08:53.666
in case
it gets chilly.

08:56.102 --> 08:58.371
To stay warm
during recess,

08:58.437 --> 08:59.672
should I wear the jacket,

08:59.739 --> 09:02.408
the smock,
or the bathrobe?

09:05.611 --> 09:06.979
LITTLE FISH:
The jacket!

09:07.046 --> 09:08.514
That's right!

09:08.581 --> 09:12.285
I might need a jacket
when we go outside for recess.

09:12.351 --> 09:14.954
Now I'm going to put everything
away in my cubby,

09:15.021 --> 09:17.256
so I'll know where it is
when I need it.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.695

the soft blocks away.

10:31.197 --> 10:32.365
That's right.

10:32.431 --> 10:35.968
Blue here, green here,
and purple here.

10:36.035 --> 10:38.337
I'm almost done.

10:40.006 --> 10:41.574
All finished!

10:41.640 --> 10:43.409
BUBBLE PUPPT:
Arf arf!

10:43.476 --> 10:44.577
Huh?

10:44.643 --> 10:46.746
Hey, what's that
doing there?

10:48.080 --> 10:49.882
Uh, Gilly,

10:49.949 --> 10:52.585
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

10:52.651 --> 10:54.954
Don't worry, Molly.
It's my job.

10:57.623 --> 10:58.691
Uh-oh.
(blocks tumble)

10:58.758 --> 11:00.960
BUBBLE PUPPY:
Arf! Arf! Arf!

11:02.728 --> 11:04.096
Oops.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.398
(giggling)

11:05.464 --> 11:07.967
Hey Molly, here comes
the school bus!

11:08.034 --> 11:11.037
Vroom vroom! Beep-beep!

11:11.737 --> 11:12.738
Hop on!

11:13.439 --> 11:14.974
(giggling)

11:15.041 --> 11:17.910
Brrroom! Brrroom! Brrroom!

11:17.977 --> 11:21.747
Welcome to our classroom
which, as you can see,

11:21.814 --> 11:23.649
is organized by areas.

11:24.283 --> 11:26.485
Here's Nonny
in the book area.

11:26.552 --> 11:27.787
Hello.

11:27.853 --> 11:30.056
And over here,
Gil and Bubble Puppy

11:30.122 --> 11:33.325
are busy building something
with blocks.

11:35.094 --> 11:37.563
And over here,
in the art area,

11:37.630 --> 11:40.833
it looks like Goby is drawing
a very interesting robot.

11:41.967 --> 11:43.903
MOLLY:
<i>What's all that purple stuff?</i>

11:43.969 --> 11:46.772
Space goop.
He got stuck in it.

11:46.839 --> 11:48.040
(giggling)

11:48.107 --> 11:49.575
Thank you, Goby.

11:49.642 --> 11:50.910
Beep. Boop. Boop!

11:50.976 --> 11:53.312
That means
"You're welcome."

11:54.847 --> 11:56.949
And over here
you'll find Oona

11:57.016 --> 12:00.419
who is staring out
of the window.

12:02.088 --> 12:04.190
Everything okay, Oona?

12:04.256 --> 12:07.593
Yeah, I'm just thinking
about Avi.

12:08.594 --> 12:12.331
I hope he's doing okay
at his first day of school.

12:12.398 --> 12:15.534
Oh, I'm sure he's doing fine.

12:15.601 --> 12:17.970
He's probably just getting
used to the routine

12:18.037 --> 12:19.472
of his classroom.

12:19.538 --> 12:23.642
You know what my favorite
part of our "routine" is?

12:23.709 --> 12:24.944
What?

12:25.010 --> 12:27.213
When Mr. Grouper says...

12:27.279 --> 12:28.481
Line up, everybody!

12:28.547 --> 12:30.816
It's time to go outside!

12:30.883 --> 12:31.951

12:56.642 --> 12:59.912
BOTH:
In spa-a-a-a-ce schoo-oo-ool!

12:59.979 --> 13:02.047
Once upon a time...

13:03.048 --> 13:06.051
<i>there was a school up</i>
<i>in space.</i>

13:09.555 --> 13:11.757
(energy hums)

13:11.824 --> 13:13.959
{\an5}MOLLY AND GIL:
Good morning,
Mr. Space Grouper.

13:14.026 --> 13:16.862
Well, good morning,
space students!

13:16.929 --> 13:20.432
Are you ready to hear about
today's routine?

13:20.499 --> 13:22.902
MOLLY AND GIL:
Yes, Mr. Space Grouper.

13:22.968 --> 13:27.306
Okay! The next part
of your routine is...

13:28.807 --> 13:31.510
{\an5}Nonny:
Beep, boop-boop.
Free play.

13:31.577 --> 13:34.980
You may choose any area
to play in. Boop.

13:36.282 --> 13:37.750
Yayyyy!

13:39.385 --> 13:41.554
Free play is awesome!

13:41.620 --> 13:44.290
{\an1}What do you want to do first,
space student Gil?

13:44.356 --> 13:47.193
Let's build a castle,
space student Molly!

13:47.259 --> 13:48.260
Okay!

13:49.662 --> 13:50.996
We need your help.

13:51.063 --> 13:53.799
{\an1}Which area should we choose
to build our castle?

13:53.866 --> 13:57.102
{\an1}The dress up area,
the block area,

13:57.169 --> 13:58.604
or the art area?

13:58.671 --> 14:00.272
Where can we build?

14:02.708 --> 14:05.911
LITTLE FISH:
Blocks! The block area!

14:05.978 --> 14:09.448
Right! We can build our castle
with blocks!

14:09.515 --> 14:11.650
{\an5}GOBY:
<i>So the space students</i>
<i>built a big,</i>

14:11.717 --> 14:14.153
<i>tall castle out of blocks,</i>

14:14.220 --> 14:15.988
<i>when suddenly...</i>

14:16.055 --> 14:19.792
{\an5}ROBOT:
Space blocks. Space blocks.
Space blocks. Space blocks.

14:19.858 --> 14:21.860
Space robot!

14:22.795 --> 14:23.796
(whirring)

14:29.668 --> 14:31.270
Where did he come from?

14:31.337 --> 14:32.438
(door whirs open)

14:33.439 --> 14:34.707
I don't know,

14:34.773 --> 14:37.076
but let's go do something else
for free play.

14:37.142 --> 14:39.878
Okay. What do you want
to do instead?

14:39.945 --> 14:41.947
Let's draw pictures!

14:43.949 --> 14:45.417
{\an1}We need your help
to find a place

14:45.484 --> 14:47.620
where we can draw pictures.

14:47.686 --> 14:50.022
{\an1}Should we choose
the dress-up area,

14:50.089 --> 14:51.490
the block area,

14:51.557 --> 14:53.225
or the art area?

14:53.292 --> 14:55.294
Where can we draw?

14:57.496 --> 14:59.999
LITTLE FISH:
Art! The art area!

15:00.065 --> 15:03.269
{\an1}Yeah! We can draw pictures
in the art area!

15:03.335 --> 15:06.505
{\an5}<i>GOBY:</i>
<i>So the space students</i>

15:18.984 --> 15:20.386
{\an1}Aw, man!

15:20.452 --> 15:23.322
{\an1}Now he's messing up
the art area.

15:23.389 --> 15:25.557
{\an1}Let's go do something else
for free play.

15:27.393 --> 15:29.395
Space goop table!

15:32.398 --> 15:34.900
Spa-a-a-ce goo-oo-oop!

15:34.967 --> 15:36.302

15:37.603 --> 15:39.805

16:14.940 --> 16:17.643

16:38.397 --> 16:41.834
Boo hoo-hoo-hoo.

Boo hoo-hoo-hoo.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.237
{\an1}Awww!

16:45.304 --> 16:46.538
Don't cry, robot!

16:46.605 --> 16:49.441
We'll get you
out of there.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.110
ROBOT:
Thank you.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.679

17:01.286 --> 17:03.188
I made a mess.

17:03.255 --> 17:04.390
In free play,

17:04.455 --> 17:06.258
it's okay
to get a little messy.

17:06.325 --> 17:08.394
You just have to clean up
after yourself.

17:10.796 --> 17:14.500

Everybody, clean up!

a question.

19:10.182 --> 19:11.283

Yes?

19:16.421 --> 19:18.924
I'm hungry.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.425
Now remember,

19:20.492 --> 19:22.694
you have to raise your hand
if you want to speak.

19:22.761 --> 19:24.530

gets a turn.

19:25.531 --> 19:27.366
