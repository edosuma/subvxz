20:42.374 --> 20:44.743
- Did you see that?
- I told you.

20:44.810 --> 20:47.279
[ air escaping ]

20:47.346 --> 20:48.080
- Uh-oh.

20:48.146 --> 20:49.414
- Patina! Your suit!

20:49.481 --> 20:51.550
- Forget the suit!
What about my tongue?

20:54.152 --> 20:56.722
- Could someone
take me to the hospital?

20:59.858 --> 21:01.760
- Yea, I got you...

21:09.801 --> 21:11.169
- Nice shot, "bro."

21:11.236 --> 21:13.372
- Yeah, but that
backflip though...

21:15.374 --> 21:19.311
- Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow
ow ow ow ow ow...

21:20.879 --> 21:22.381
- Good job.
- Thanks.

21:22.447 --> 21:23.815
Hey, good work
with that laser.

21:23.882 --> 21:26.151
- Thanks, I really
enjoy zapping people.

21:27.653 --> 21:31.757
- And we saved
the world's most poisonous...

21:31.823 --> 21:34.660
...cactus is gone.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.968
- What's it say?

21:43.035 --> 21:44.703
- "Thanks for the cactus.

21:44.770 --> 21:47.439
Game On."

21:51.910 --> 21:54.346
- Oohhhhh! Oh no!

21:54.413 --> 21:56.481
This is bad.
This is very very bad.
