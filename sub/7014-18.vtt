WEBVTT

00:03.100 --> 00:05.400
Hey, donna, when we register
for our wedding,

00:05.400 --> 00:08.800
could we register
for a trampoline?

00:08.800 --> 00:12.100
My mom won't let me have
a trampoline.

00:12.100 --> 00:13.400
If I'd known
about registering

00:13.400 --> 00:15.100
when I married laurie,
I would have registered

00:15.100 --> 00:19.100
for a wife who wants
to have sex with me.

00:20.300 --> 00:22.100
Eric, you know,

00:22.100 --> 00:23.800
people only register
for stuff that's used

00:23.800 --> 00:26.200
in serving, eating
and clearing of a meal.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.400
Why is it always
about eating?

00:28.400 --> 00:29.600
Because
marriage signifies

00:29.600 --> 00:32.800
the end of trying
to be attractive.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.600
Man, registering sucks.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.400
I had to register with jackie
for her sweet 16.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.700
Longest five months
of my life.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.600
Look, all I know
is you guys are gonna buy

00:42.600 --> 00:44.100
whatever wedding present
we tell you,

00:44.100 --> 00:46.700
and none of this all-going-in-
on-one-gift crap.

00:46.700 --> 00:48.200
Hey, hey, shut it, huh?

00:48.200 --> 00:50.500
No talk about weddings.
Jackie's on her way over.

00:50.500 --> 00:51.500
She's not here now.

00:51.500 --> 00:52.900
She doesn't have to hear
the word "wedding."

00:52.900 --> 00:56.200
She can sense
that it was said.

00:56.300 --> 00:57.700
I wish
I could do that.

00:57.700 --> 00:58.700
But not so much
with words,

00:58.700 --> 01:02.700
but so that I could see
through people's clothes.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.099
Look, you two start yapping
about your wedding,

01:05.099 --> 01:08.300
jackie gets all, "steven,
when are we getting married?"

01:08.300 --> 01:10.000
Then I have to say,
"we're not getting married,"

01:10.000 --> 01:12.500
and she kicks me
in my shins.

01:12.700 --> 01:15.600
>From the knees down,
I'm like a frickin' P.O.W.

01:15.600 --> 01:19.000
No, you have
magnificent legs.

01:19.300 --> 01:21.900
I would say W.O.W.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.300
Wow.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.700
May I help...

01:35.900 --> 01:38.100
oh, it's you.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.100
Hello, fenton.

01:42.700 --> 01:45.100
You two
know each other?

01:45.100 --> 01:49.100
Yeah, this is the weirdo
who sold me your ring.

01:49.800 --> 01:53.800
He's probably worn it
more than you, so...

01:54.200 --> 01:56.000
maybe she doesn't want
to wear it

01:56.000 --> 01:58.600
because it's from you.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.600
Well, maybe you need to keep
your nose outta my business!

02:01.600 --> 02:03.700
Trust me, your business
is the last place

02:03.700 --> 02:06.400
I want to put my nose!

02:10.000 --> 02:11.500
I'm sorry, man.
Me too.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.300
Yeah.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.400
We're here to register
for our wedding.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.700
Oh, wonderful.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.900
And I see we're starting
with silverware.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.400
Yes, I like this one.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.200
No, eric,
the wedding book says

02:22.200 --> 02:24.600
we can't pick
the first thing we see.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.600
Oh, well, in that case,
yeah, the first one, eh.

02:29.900 --> 02:33.800
Second one, whoo-hoo!
All right.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Let's wrap it up,
hit the food court.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.900
Here's a small sampling
from our collection--

02:39.900 --> 02:41.700
prestige, exhilaration,

02:41.700 --> 02:43.700
and, oh,
my personal favorite,

02:43.700 --> 02:46.000
brash.
Ooh.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.600
Well, fenton, you may be
surprised to learn

02:48.600 --> 02:52.600
that your personal favorite
is not our personal favorite.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.400
But, anyway,

02:55.400 --> 02:56.500
we're done.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.300
No, eric,
the wedding book says

02:58.300 --> 03:00.300
that we have to look
at all the patterns.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.800
Today is just
a scouting trip.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.000
Scouting?

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
You know, I was asked
to resign from the scouts.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.400
Look, it's kind of like...

03:12.400 --> 03:14.600
okay, remember before
we were together

03:14.600 --> 03:17.000
and we dated, like,
all those different people

03:17.000 --> 03:19.400
before we decided
on each other?

03:19.400 --> 03:22.100
No, not really. No.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.600
Eric, come on.
This is supposed to be fun.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.500
Okay, look at the groom
in this picture.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.800
What is the difference
between you and him?

03:30.800 --> 03:33.400
Um, he's a cartoon?

03:35.200 --> 03:37.800
No, he is smiling.

03:37.800 --> 03:41.400
Yeah, because
he's a cartoon.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.300
Look, these are all
the forks I have here.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.600
I'll have to bring
the rest up from storage.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.300
I guess I'll need
a forklift.

03:48.300 --> 03:51.400
Oh. (Chuckles)
whoo.

03:51.800 --> 03:55.100
Oh, I made a funny.
(Laughs)

03:55.800 --> 03:57.000
well, it's A...

03:57.000 --> 03:59.300
it's a good thing
we have all day.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.700
All day? Wh--

04:01.700 --> 04:04.700
I'm not spending all day
in a department store.

04:04.700 --> 04:07.800
I'm gonna turn
into him.

04:09.700 --> 04:10.900
Okay, um,

04:10.900 --> 04:14.400
you're not as far away
as you think.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.700
Okay, that's it.

04:15.700 --> 04:18.000
I'm going to
the sporting goods department.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Hmm, men.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.600
You can't live with 'em...

04:21.600 --> 04:23.900
well, you can.

04:23.900 --> 04:27.700
But you have to keep quiet
about it.

04:30.500 --> 04:34.100
That 70's show S06E18
Hangin' out 

04:34.100 --> 04:37.600
That 70's show S06E18
down the street 

04:37.600 --> 04:40.100
the same old thing 

04:41.300 --> 04:44.000
that you did last week 

04:44.700 --> 04:48.700
Captured by Raceman in Canada
not a thing to do 

04:48.700 --> 04:52.400
Captured by Raceman in Canada
but talk to you 

04:52.400 --> 04:56.400
Sync by Ninjaw P.B.@forom.com
we're all all right 

04:56.600 --> 04:59.900
(man) hello, wisconsin!

05:01.000 --> 05:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:08.300 --> 05:12.300
Reading another one of
your dirty girl books?

05:13.300 --> 05:17.300
They're not dirty,
they're romantic.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.400
"Mutiny from behind."

05:22.900 --> 05:26.600
Yeah. The mutiny
sneaks up on her.

05:28.700 --> 05:32.600
I don't think
that's what it means.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.300
Well, it is
a wonderful book.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.700
It's got pirates and action.
Oh, oh, oh!

05:36.700 --> 05:38.400
It has
this hilarious parrot

05:38.400 --> 05:42.400
that says the most
inappropriate things.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.600
(Reading)
"the pirate's vessel

05:49.600 --> 05:53.600
"slowly sailed into the harbor
of san sebastian island.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.500
"His saucy prisoner's
alabaster breasts

05:58.500 --> 06:02.500
"heaving with every motion
"of the tall, rigid ship."

06:08.100 --> 06:11.000
San sebastian island.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.900
I think I killed
some commies there.

06:19.800 --> 06:23.800
I just spent six hours
registeringfor wedding gifts.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
The only reasonI'm here now
is I pretended to chokeon ice cream.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.800
I'll let you inon a little secret
for when you're shoppingwith women.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.800
Always pick the ugliest,worst choice,
and you're off the hook.

06:41.400 --> 06:45.200
That's how I got out ofshopping for this couch.

06:45.200 --> 06:49.100
There was an uglier couchthan this?

06:49.100 --> 06:52.800
The one I pickedhad dragons on it.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Wow, you're sneaky.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.200
You know, you act likeyou're all about brute force,

06:58.200 --> 07:01.300
but you'rea finesse player, man.

07:01.300 --> 07:02.400
Trust me, son.

07:02.400 --> 07:06.400
Don't budge untilyou hear the magic words,
"oh, I'll justdo it myself."

07:13.200 --> 07:15.200
You're done registeringalready?

07:15.200 --> 07:17.700
You men, you just don't knowhow to shop.

07:17.700 --> 07:21.700
You know, your fatheronce tried to get me
to buy a couchwith dragons on it.

07:24.100 --> 07:26.200
Yeah...

07:26.200 --> 07:29.200
I guessI'm just bad at it.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.700
(Neil diamond)
I'd much rather be

07:31.700 --> 07:34.900
forever in blue jeans, babe 

07:36.900 --> 07:39.600
what do you thinkof this fork?

07:39.600 --> 07:43.600
Donna, I thinkall this stuff
is too ordinary for us,you know?

07:44.700 --> 07:48.600
Let's get somethingbejeweled.

07:51.400 --> 07:54.700
Who are you--liberace?

07:54.700 --> 07:56.400
Yes.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.200
I'm liberace.

07:59.900 --> 08:03.000
Eric, this wedding is--
hey, guys.What's up?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.900
Oh, hey.
We werejust talking about

08:05.900 --> 08:09.700
slutty cheerleadersin other schools.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.600
You never wantto talk about that.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.800
Well, I've finallycome around, darling.

08:13.800 --> 08:17.800
Oh! Are thosewedding gift catalogs?
Damn it.

08:17.800 --> 08:20.100
For our wedding,
steven and I--jackie, no.

08:20.100 --> 08:24.100
Steven, we have to--no.
A good bride and groom--that's it. You're done.

08:34.799 --> 08:38.799
Now why didn't someonedo that five years ago?

08:39.700 --> 08:42.200
She used to bite.

08:42.900 --> 08:44.600
Now this, okay,

08:44.600 --> 08:47.500
this is whatI'm talking about.
That's a nice fork.

08:47.500 --> 08:51.500
Eric, the handleis an actual deer hoof.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.100
Yeah, that'sthe cherokee collection.

08:55.100 --> 08:57.600
Donna,that's the indian way.

08:57.600 --> 09:01.600
They kill the animal,
then eat itwith its own paw.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.100
Okay, you know what?I have a new plan.

09:05.100 --> 09:08.700
I'll just go shopping,
and then I'll show youwhat I pick.

09:08.700 --> 09:11.700
So I don't getto go at all?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.100
Um, no. I'll just...

09:15.100 --> 09:18.200
I'll just do itby myself.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.600
Yeah...

09:21.600 --> 09:24.600
I guessI'm just bad at it.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.600
(Reading) "after throwing the evil pirate king overboard,

09:33.600 --> 09:35.900
"the duke turned to lady daphne,

09:35.900 --> 09:38.400
"pulled his sword from its sheath

09:38.400 --> 09:41.200
"and held it erect.

09:41.200 --> 09:45.100
"Lady daphne touched it tentatively,

09:45.100 --> 09:47.600
"and a shudder went through the duke."

09:47.600 --> 09:51.600
So you likethose books, too, mr. Red.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.100
All right, fine.So you know.

09:55.100 --> 09:59.100
But you tell one person,and so help me god,
I will chop downwhatever tree you live in.

10:07.700 --> 10:11.700
So I was daydreaming duringthis civil rights lecture
at the police academy,

10:13.800 --> 10:17.800
and I came up with a great ideafor an invention--
adult strollers.

10:23.100 --> 10:26.900
Why walk when someonecan push you?

10:28.400 --> 10:31.400
Kelso,that's a wheelchair.

10:31.400 --> 10:35.400
All right, it's official.
Everything's been thought of!

10:35.500 --> 10:39.500
All right, what do you thinkof this fork?
Whoa. No, no, no,no, no, no, no.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.100
You're not gonnarope me into that.
Just make eric do it.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.000
No, eric's bannedfrom doing it.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
He actually wanted me
to eat dinnerwith bambi's foot.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.900
What is this,the cherokee collection?

10:50.900 --> 10:54.900
Oh, well, he pickedthe ugliest one
so you wouldn'tmake him go shopping.

10:56.700 --> 10:59.100
It's classic.

11:00.200 --> 11:04.200
I knewsomething was fishy.
He's terrifiedof indians.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.700
Oh, he's gonna payfor this.
He thought he hada bad time the other day?

11:08.700 --> 11:12.700
He doesn't knowwhat a bad time is.
I am gonna stophaving sex with him.

11:15.200 --> 11:18.500
Oh, crap,I already did that.

11:18.500 --> 11:22.500
All right, look,I hate to sell him out,
but the poor kidlacks subtlety.

11:23.300 --> 11:25.600
He'S... eric'S...

11:25.600 --> 11:29.300
how do I put...oh, he's a bit of a rube.

11:29.300 --> 11:33.300
You know, like,a little country.
A maroon, if you will.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.400
Kelso,what's your point?

11:37.400 --> 11:41.400
Well, I'm just sayingyou could do better.
I mean, I'm here,you're here.

11:43.800 --> 11:47.500
(Whispers)nobody has to know.

11:47.500 --> 11:51.500
Kelso!
Okay, fine,you can tell two friends.

11:58.100 --> 12:02.100
So I invested $11 in kelso'sadult stroller idea.

12:03.400 --> 12:06.900
I'm going to bea millionaire.

12:07.200 --> 12:10.600
Really?
So, uh,if I buy one, like,

12:10.600 --> 12:13.500
who's gonnapush me around?

12:13.500 --> 12:16.000
Trained bears.

12:16.400 --> 12:20.400
Kelso's got itall figured out.
I'm just the money man.

12:20.700 --> 12:23.100
Hey, guys,where's donna?
I found this place

12:23.100 --> 12:27.100
that etches your silhouetteon your china.
Oh, we are so doing thatwhen we get married.

12:27.800 --> 12:31.800
Steven, people can eatright off my face.

12:33.900 --> 12:37.800
Then guesswho's coming to dinner.

12:38.600 --> 12:42.600
Jackie, you'redriving me insane.
Look, I want youto make me a promise.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
You will not talkabout weddings
or anything wedding-related

12:46.000 --> 12:49.600
in or aroundthe united states.

12:50.300 --> 12:53.400
Fine, I won't talkabout weddings
or anything wedding-related

12:53.400 --> 12:55.700
in or aroundthe continental united states.

12:55.700 --> 12:58.600
Not the continentalunited states.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.000
We're talkinghawaii and alaska, too.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
Fine, but if we'reever in canada,
I am going nuts!

13:05.700 --> 13:07.700
Eric, bad news.

13:07.700 --> 13:11.100
A deejay at the radio stationgot sick,
so I have to coverhis shift all week.

So what will ibe doing?

14:39.500 --> 14:43.500

15:03.900 --> 15:06.800
This spice rackis a real mess.

15:06.800 --> 15:10.800
It's like someonegot drunk

15:11.400 --> 15:15.400

16:44.400 --> 16:48.400
Okay, fine.Bicycles without engines.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.500

16:56.800 --> 17:00.800

Yeah,she's got you there.
I mean, your girlfriendis annoying.

17:40.600 --> 17:44.600
Plus, I used to do itwith her all the time.
So that's gotta hurt.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.200

18:05.700 --> 18:09.700
A lady never talks

18:10.600 --> 18:14.600
Ah, looks like redpicked up some tricks

18:17.800 --> 18:20.900

18:23.900 --> 18:27.300
Ironically, from behind.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.800
See, eric, this isthe perfect tux for you.

18:35.800 --> 18:39.800
It makes you look likeyou actually have shoulders.

18:40.100 --> 18:41.300
You know, i do look

18:41.300 --> 18:44.500

Mm-hmm.

18:44.500 --> 18:48.500
Why are you wearinga wedding dress?

18:50.700 --> 18:53.700
(Donna) what the hell?

18:53.700 --> 18:57.700
I cannot believewhat I'm seeing.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.400
Eric, this wassupposed to be our time.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.700
Donna, wait.

19:10.100 --> 19:13.300
Okay, steven,I know I promised
I wouldn't doany wedding stuff,

19:13.300 --> 19:15.400
and I know you'reprobably really mad,

19:15.400 --> 19:19.400
so just go ahead
and yell.You're beautiful.

19:19.400 --> 19:23.400
Oh, my god.
You like mein a wedding dress,

19:23.600 --> 19:27.600
which means that someday,we're gonna get married,
which means that ican talk about it.

19:27.700 --> 19:31.400
Oh, steven! Okay,I want a spring wedding,
outsidewith white doves.

19:31.400 --> 19:35.200
And I want the sunto be setting behind me
so I have a halo,kind of like an angel.

19:35.200 --> 19:39.000
Oh, and then wild mustangs

19:39.000 --> 19:42.600
Oh, but your familycan't come.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.500
Oh, you know what?
You can run,but you can't hide.

19:46.500 --> 19:49.300
I know where you live!

19:50.900 --> 19:54.000
Donna...
what's the matter?

19:54.000 --> 19:57.600
You picked a deer-foot fork
just to get outof shopping with me.

19:57.600 --> 20:01.600
Oh, too obvious, huh?
Yeah, no one wantshairy silverware.

20:03.300 --> 20:06.800
I just don't understandhow you could have
more fun with jackiethan with me.

20:06.800 --> 20:10.400
I don't know.
I mean, you know,she doesn't ask me questions.

20:10.400 --> 20:13.600
She just tells mewhat to do.

20:14.100 --> 20:18.100
It's a strangekind of freedom,
but I know whythe caged bird sings, donna.

20:21.800 --> 20:25.000
So you're sayingthe way to handle you
is just take awayyour free will

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
and order you around?
Donna, that's the wayI was raised.

20:29.500 --> 20:33.300
Eric, I can'ttell you what to do
because I don't evenknow what to do.

20:33.300 --> 20:36.000
I mean, that's whyI got that stupid book.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
I hate that book.Kelso was right.
Reading just gets youinto trouble.

20:44.500 --> 20:47.400
Forks don't matterto me, eric.
I mean, they don'T.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.500
They don'T.
In 20 years,

20:49.500 --> 20:53.500
food's just gonna bea little pill anyway.

20:54.700 --> 20:57.300
Look, let's just do
this whole wedding thingour way.

20:57.300 --> 20:59.000
Yes.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.800
What's our way?

21:02.100 --> 21:04.200
I don't know.

21:04.200 --> 21:07.800
Maybe we should ask jackie.
(Laughs)

21:07.800 --> 21:11.100

21:11.900 --> 21:14.000
