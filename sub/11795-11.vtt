00:04.003 --> 00:06.806
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.840 --> 00:09.676
    <i>* I don't think</i>
    <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.709 --> 00:12.579
  <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
  <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.612 --> 00:16.082
  <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
  <i>just in time</i>
  <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.116 --> 00:21.821
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.855 --> 00:24.991
   <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
   <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:25.025 --> 00:27.961
   <i>* And my dog ate</i>
   <i>all my homework last night</i>

00:27.994 --> 00:30.830
  <i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
  <i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

00:30.864 --> 00:34.334
 <i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>
 <i>it'll be all right</i>

00:34.367 --> 00:38.972
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:53.053 --> 00:56.156
   <i>* It's all right</i>

00:58.825 --> 01:03.196
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved</i>
   <i>by the bell *</i>

01:17.977 --> 01:21.081
 Every person in here
 made a fortune
 before they were 20.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.083
And you know what they
have in common with me?

01:23.083 --> 01:26.586
 Nothing. That's why
 you're not in there.

01:26.619 --> 01:28.621
  No, dummy.
  We have big ideas.

01:28.655 --> 01:30.657
And big ideas
make big money.

01:30.690 --> 01:32.258
 Last time you had a big idea,

01:32.292 --> 01:34.461
 I wound up with
 my tongue stuck
 to a moving airplane.

01:37.697 --> 01:39.466
  Hey, look at this.

01:39.499 --> 01:42.369
 "Get a 900 number
 and charge two bucks a call."

01:42.402 --> 01:45.472
  Look.
  Now we just need a gimmick.

01:45.505 --> 01:47.774
 Oh, here's one, Lisa.

01:47.807 --> 01:50.677
 "Dear Donna, I went to a luau
 with this really cute guy.

01:50.710 --> 01:52.779
  "We had a really great time,
  but he hasn't called since.

01:52.812 --> 01:55.882
 What should I do?
 Waiting in Waikiki."

01:55.915 --> 01:58.585
   Well, maybe this
   hula-babe was an oinker.

02:00.453 --> 02:03.757
  Obviously we don't have to go
  to a luau to find a pig.

02:06.259 --> 02:08.127
   Why wait for him to call?

02:08.161 --> 02:10.163
If she likes the guy,
she should ask him out.

02:10.196 --> 02:12.332
   That's exactly what
   Dear Donna said.

02:12.365 --> 02:13.967
What are you
talking about?

02:14.067 --> 02:16.936
 It's amazing.
 Lisa and Dear Donna
 always give the same advice.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.407
  Well who cares about her?
  I'm hungry.

02:20.440 --> 02:23.610
   Hey, Mama, want to have
   a burger with a real man?

02:25.512 --> 02:27.747
  Sure, I'll go look for one.

02:29.582 --> 02:31.618
   Killer bees
   in your pantyhose again?

02:32.852 --> 02:34.954
   Buzz off, bubba.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.990
Zack: See you, Slater.

02:38.224 --> 02:39.459
 You're as good as Dear Donna.

02:39.492 --> 02:40.694
 You really think so?

02:40.727 --> 02:43.530
   Yeah,
   and Dear Donna's famous.

02:43.563 --> 02:45.865
And famous
means wealthy.

02:45.899 --> 02:48.134
 And wealthy means...

02:48.168 --> 02:49.736
( cash register rings )

02:51.104 --> 02:53.306
I just found our gimmick...
The Lisa Line.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.610
 Hi guys. I missed you
 at the game.

02:57.644 --> 02:59.646
Hi, Zack. Think quick.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.681
   How's the cutest pitcher
   in seventh grade?

03:01.715 --> 03:03.283
 Zack!

03:03.316 --> 03:05.785
 You should've seen her.
 My little sister
 pitched a no-hitter.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.587
 Actually it was a one-hitter.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.556
 I beaned a guy
 who was flirting with Kelly.

03:09.589 --> 03:11.624
Way to go, Nicki-babe.

03:11.658 --> 03:13.193
  I owe it all to you, Zack.

03:13.226 --> 03:15.095
 You taught me how to throw
 that great curve.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.896
   You're terrific.

03:16.930 --> 03:19.265
   You're not only cute,
   but smart.
   I love this kid.

03:25.572 --> 03:28.475
 I just know the prince
 is going to pick me.

03:28.508 --> 03:30.677
   Dream on, girl.
   The prince will pick me.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.079
   After all,
   I am a princess.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.982
  Forget it. I've got
  the hottest moves in town.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.619
( beat-boxing )

03:43.823 --> 03:46.192
   <i>* All rise for the dude</i>
   <i>you've been waiting to see</i>

03:46.226 --> 03:48.728
 <i>* Here comes the prince</i>
 <i>Prince Zachary</i>

03:52.732 --> 03:55.301
 <i>* I've looked uptown, downtown</i>
 <i>and I still seek her</i>

03:55.335 --> 03:57.370
<i>* Rapping all day</i>
<i>and I'm getting weaker</i>

03:57.404 --> 03:59.572
   <i>* If you're not</i>
   <i>the girl I want you can</i>
   <i>take the geek here</i>

03:59.606 --> 04:01.741
   <i>* 'Cause my girlie-girl</i>
   <i>will fit the gold sneaker!</i>

04:06.413 --> 04:08.715
<i>* Sorry Prince Zack</i>
<i>time to retreat</i>

04:08.748 --> 04:10.784
  <i>* All of these ladies</i>
  <i>have fat feet!</i>

04:15.088 --> 04:16.690
  <i>* Before I go won't you</i>
  <i>try on the shoe?</i>

04:16.723 --> 04:18.825
<i>* Because you never know</i>
<i>It might fit you</i>

04:23.329 --> 04:25.465
   <i>* Oh, Prince Zack</i>
   <i>you're my dream come true</i>

04:25.498 --> 04:26.700
<i>* I love you so</i>

04:26.733 --> 04:27.901
 <i>* And I love you too *</i>

04:32.572 --> 04:34.074
 How much do you think
 we're going to make off this?

04:34.107 --> 04:37.377
 I don't know, let's see.
 It's about $2 a call,

04:37.410 --> 04:39.079
  five hours a day...

04:39.079 --> 04:40.513
and seven days a week,

04:40.547 --> 04:43.149
and...
Oh wow!

04:43.183 --> 04:44.484
   We're rich! Hey!

04:44.517 --> 04:46.419
  Both: We are rich!

04:46.453 --> 04:50.490
We're rich! We're rich!
We're rich,
we're rich, we're rich!

04:50.523 --> 04:53.626
   We're rich,
   we're rich, we're rich!
   We're rich! Yeah!

04:53.660 --> 04:55.161
  Rich! Rich!

04:55.195 --> 04:56.229
  Zack? Zack.

04:56.262 --> 04:57.297
   We're rich.

04:58.932 --> 05:02.135
Uh, Lisa. How long
you been here?

05:02.168 --> 05:04.204
   Long enough to witness
   your little dweeb dance.

05:05.772 --> 05:07.173
 Now why'd you want me
 to come over?

05:07.207 --> 05:09.609
We're starting a Teen Line,
and kids will call up

05:09.642 --> 05:11.778
   and you'll give them advice.
   What do you think?

05:11.811 --> 05:14.447
   That sounds great. How much
   do you think we'll make?

05:14.481 --> 05:16.950
Money? How can you
think of money

05:17.050 --> 05:20.387
 when the well-being
 of your fellow
 students is at stake?

05:20.420 --> 05:23.056
  Get real.
  I want half of everything.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.058
 Okay, deal.

05:25.058 --> 05:27.961
  But no more free advice,
  and no one
  can know we're doing this.

05:35.468 --> 05:36.936
 A Teen Line?

05:36.970 --> 05:39.072
 I would never call
 one of those.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.840
  Yeah, it'd be like
  asking love advice

05:40.874 --> 05:43.176
  from someone who knows
  nothing about the subject.

05:43.209 --> 05:45.545
 Someone like... you.

05:48.415 --> 05:51.618
Hey baby, I haven't had any
complaints in
the love department.

05:51.651 --> 05:53.820
 You haven't had
 any shoppers, either.

05:55.755 --> 05:58.091
 Look, you've been on my case
 for the last couple of weeks.

05:58.124 --> 06:00.560
 If you've got something
 to say, then say it.

06:00.593 --> 06:02.929
   Okay, macho man, I will.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.198
   First of all, I had a really
   good time at the prom,

06:05.231 --> 06:07.233
  and I was hoping
  we'd go out again.

06:07.267 --> 06:09.569
 Yeah? Well, so did I.

06:09.602 --> 06:11.037
  You never called.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.405
  Why should I call?

06:12.439 --> 06:14.040
 Remember, you walked me home.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.309
 So?

06:16.343 --> 06:18.311
   So do you want to go out
   Saturday night?

06:18.345 --> 06:19.479
Maybe.

06:19.512 --> 06:20.680
Maybe?

06:20.714 --> 06:22.949
 Maybe your blow-dryer
 blew your brains out.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.854
( phone rings )

06:27.887 --> 06:30.056
   ( Australian accent )
   Teen Line, this is Nitro.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.658
  What's your problem, mate?

06:31.691 --> 06:34.561
 My girl's upset with me 'cause
 she thinks I'm
 not smart like her.

06:34.594 --> 06:36.062
   I ain't no dummy.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.100
 Hey, Lisa, this guy
 wants his girlfriend

06:40.133 --> 06:42.168
   to appreciate the mind
   he doesn't have.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.303
   Tell him to write
   her a love poem.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.271
  All right.

06:45.305 --> 06:48.608
 Hey, mate. How about you write
 your little lady a love poem?

06:49.142 --> 06:50.276
Huh...

06:50.310 --> 06:53.513
Is that one of those things
where the words rhyme?

06:55.081 --> 06:56.349
 Yeah.

06:56.383 --> 06:59.886
I could do that.
Thanks, Nitro.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.822
Would you ever go steady
with a guy named Moose?

07:02.856 --> 07:05.291
 Why not? You could always
 hang your coat on his antlers.

07:05.325 --> 07:07.060
Thank you for calling.

07:07.627 --> 07:08.928
( phone rings )

07:09.029 --> 07:11.431
 Teen Line. This is The Antman.
 What's bugging you?

07:14.634 --> 07:16.803
   ( Southern accent )
   This is Princess,
   how y'all doing?

07:16.836 --> 07:18.872
   I'm calling for
   a friend of mine.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.409
 It's Jessie.
 She's got the hots for Slater.

07:23.476 --> 07:25.578
It's just that this guy
asked her out

07:25.612 --> 07:27.047
 and they're totally different.

07:27.047 --> 07:30.216
And she doesn't
know if I should...
I mean, she should, go.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.886
  Well, opposites do attract.

07:32.919 --> 07:35.755
 Tell your friend to just relax
 and have a good time.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.957
I'll tell her.
Thanks.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.060
( phone rings )

07:41.728 --> 07:45.198
  Teen Line. This is Nitro.
  It's your two bucks, mate.

07:45.231 --> 07:47.500
   Hi, Nitro.
   My name is Nicki.

07:47.534 --> 07:49.069
Hey, it's Kelly's
little sister.

07:49.569 --> 07:52.272
( phones ring )

07:52.305 --> 07:54.507
  Hello, Nicki.
  What's up?

07:54.541 --> 07:56.309
 I really,
 really like this guy.

07:56.343 --> 07:59.512
 The problem is, he's going out
 with someone I'm
 kind of close to.

07:59.546 --> 08:01.648
  Well, how does
  he feel about you?

08:01.681 --> 08:03.416
 He said he loved me.

08:03.450 --> 08:05.118
 Whoa! Hold on a sec.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.786
  Lisa, Lisa.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.722
  Not now, Zack I've got
  a girl on the phone

08:08.755 --> 08:10.824
who says she doesn't
like shopping.

08:12.859 --> 08:14.627
   Hello, Nicki?
   You still there?

08:14.661 --> 08:16.896
Yeah, what should I do?

08:16.930 --> 08:19.933
  All's fair in true love
  and war. Go for it.

08:20.033 --> 08:23.436
 You're right, Nitro.
 I'm going to tell him
  exactly how I feel.

08:26.272 --> 08:28.341
   Mrs. Zack Morris.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.650
 Ahem.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.720
 Hey, Nicki,
 is that you?

08:40.754 --> 08:42.054
  Hi, Zack.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.356
  Wow, hey, you look great.

08:43.390 --> 08:45.058
   You must be meeting
   someone special.

08:45.091 --> 08:47.494
Yeah, I am.
Zack...

08:47.527 --> 08:50.296
  I really, really,
  want to be your girlfriend.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.532
   Uh... girlfriend?

08:52.565 --> 08:54.868
 You? Me? Us?

08:54.901 --> 08:56.569
  But Kelly.

08:56.603 --> 08:58.738
"All's fair
in true love and war."

08:59.272 --> 09:01.341
  Teen Line!

09:03.810 --> 09:06.579
No, Nicki, you've
gotten some bad advice.

09:06.613 --> 09:07.914
  I don't think so.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.215
  You gotta get out of here,

09:09.249 --> 09:11.051
 because Kelly meets me
 after class.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.853
  Okay, I'll go. But not before
  I get a goodbye kiss.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.758
   Kiss? Why don't you
   wait in here? Go, go, go.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.031
   Oh, look, I've got
   to tell you about Nicki.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.133
  Nicki?
  Oh, what about her?

09:27.167 --> 09:29.169
  You wouldn't believe it.
  She's got her first crush.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.604
 Oh, I believe it, all right.

09:31.638 --> 09:32.872
 She won't tell me who it is.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.274
  Oh, good.

09:34.307 --> 09:37.043
 I mean, he's probably
 a great guy.

09:37.043 --> 09:39.679
Zack, you can't know
what this means to me.

09:39.713 --> 09:42.549
Nicki and I finally have
something we can share.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.617
   Got to jet,
   late for French.

09:49.789 --> 09:52.659
I love what you've done
with your locker, Zack.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.161
  I'm ready.

09:55.195 --> 09:58.064
Nicki, I'm begging you.
Please go now.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.133
Not before
I get my kiss.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.609
   I love you, Zack.

10:15.515 --> 10:17.384
   What a slimeball!

10:19.319 --> 10:21.054
 Ring.

10:21.087 --> 10:23.189
Come on, ring.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.158
Please ring,
please?

10:25.191 --> 10:27.994
  Great news, Zack.
  Teen Line's a hit!

10:28.028 --> 10:30.030
 Lisa solved
 everyone's problems.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.798
   G  Thank you.sa.

10:31.831 --> 10:33.166
You're fired.

10:33.199 --> 10:34.501
Fired?

10:36.336 --> 10:38.338
  Fine. But I'm not leaving
  until I get paid.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.739
Why should I pay you?

10:39.773 --> 10:41.074
 Because if you don't

10:41.107 --> 10:43.009
 I'll tell everyone
 you're behind the Teen Line.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.180
Screech, pay the lady.

10:51.284 --> 10:54.521
  Gee, Zack, what'd you want
  her to do? Give bad advice?

10:55.021 --> 10:56.289
 Yeah.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.391
  Hey, from now on,
  we give bad advice.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.727
People will break up,
be miserable,
and call for more help.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.762
   ( phone rings )

11:02.796 --> 11:04.297
Watch.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.733
   ( Australian accent )
   Teen Line. This is Nitro.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.802
Women are nuts.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.537
 It's Slater.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.939
This girl's been begging me
to ask her out, right?

11:12.972 --> 11:16.076
  I finally do
  and she says maybe.

11:17.777 --> 11:20.413
 Maybe? Huh!
 Hey, get rid of her.

11:20.447 --> 11:23.817
Yeah, yeah, I will.
Thanks, Nitro.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.986
 That was rotten
 advice, Zack.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.655
   Thank you, mate.

11:29.889 --> 11:32.926
Zack's going out
with my sister, Nicki?

11:32.959 --> 11:34.527
 Get serious.

11:34.561 --> 11:37.130
 I am serious. I saw them
 the other day
 acting very friendly.

11:37.163 --> 11:40.800
 Well, of course they're acting
 friendly,
 silly, they're friends.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.572
Jessie, about our date
Saturday night?

11:45.605 --> 11:47.007
 Yes?

11:47.107 --> 11:48.408
  Well, forget it. It's off.

11:51.778 --> 11:54.881
 Jessie, are you okay?

11:54.914 --> 11:59.486
   Hey, Jessie.
   Don't be so upset,
   just call the Teen Line.

11:59.519 --> 12:02.622
  Well,
  there's another customer.
  Now, let's get a few more.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.557
  Hi, Kelly.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.693
 I gotta go help Jessie.
 I'll see you tonight?

12:06.726 --> 12:08.862
 Tonight?
 No, I can't.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.897
   I mean, l've got
   something going.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.732
I'll call you tomorrow.

12:12.766 --> 12:15.068
Oh, okay, Zack.

12:15.101 --> 12:16.136
  Let's go.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.203
Okay.

12:19.139 --> 12:22.776
  Hey, Louise. Going
 to the lnsect
  Rodeo this weekend?

12:22.809 --> 12:27.147
  No, my Moosie's gonna read me
  some more of his poetry.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.884
   ''The birds and the bees
   in the trees

12:30.917 --> 12:33.386
   don't compare
   to your knees, Louise''?

12:33.420 --> 12:36.089
 Ohhh.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.391
  I've always loved
  that poem.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.960
What? You mean that's
not a Moosie original?

12:40.994 --> 12:42.796
   Screech: Huh-uh.

12:42.829 --> 12:44.864
   Hey, Louise,
   you like my poem?

12:47.167 --> 12:49.102
Is that a yes?

12:51.838 --> 12:53.840
( phone rings )

12:53.873 --> 12:56.509
   ( Australian accent )
   Teen Line. This is Nitro.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.111
  Hi, Nitro. This is Kelly.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.579
 ( no accent ) Kelly?

12:59.612 --> 13:02.048
( Australian accent )
I mean, hello.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.616
  Look, I've got
  a problem.

13:03.650 --> 13:06.052
 I think my boyfriend's
 dating my kid sister.

13:06.052 --> 13:07.821
Really?

13:07.854 --> 13:09.389
Yes, what should I do?

13:09.422 --> 13:12.058
   Don't do anything.
   Hold on.

13:15.595 --> 13:18.965
   Please, be home.
   Please, be home.

13:19.065 --> 13:20.800
( phone rings )

13:20.834 --> 13:21.968
Hello?

13:22.068 --> 13:23.370
Yeah, Lisa. It's Zack.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.271
 Nicki's got a crush on me,
 and Kelly's on the other line

13:25.305 --> 13:27.107
 and she thinks
 I'm dating Nicki.
 What do I do?

13:27.140 --> 13:29.075
   I'm sorry, you must have
   the wrong Lisa.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.944
  This is the one you fired.

13:30.977 --> 13:34.247
  Oh, no, Lisa, please.
  I'll give you
  anything you want.

13:34.280 --> 13:37.250
Fine. Give me all
of Teen Line's profits.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.752
 Hey, that's robbery.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.186
   Yeah, isn't it?

13:40.220 --> 13:42.422
( phone rings )

13:42.455 --> 13:44.457
All right, just
hold on a sec.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.226
   Teen Line,
   what do you want?

13:46.259 --> 13:48.194
 Hi, Nitro.
 This is Nicki again.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.130
   Oh, no. I mean, hold on.

13:52.899 --> 13:54.668
   All right, Lisa, you win.
   Nicki's on the line, too.

13:54.701 --> 13:55.735
   Could you help?

13:55.769 --> 13:56.936
   Calm down, Zack.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.905
  Just be honest with Kelly.

13:58.938 --> 14:00.306
 And what
 about Nicki?

14:00.340 --> 14:03.710
 She's young and vulnerable.
 Let her down gently, got it?

14:03.743 --> 14:05.745
Yeah, right.
Gently.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.852
 Sounds like the guy's
 really hung-up on your sister

14:12.886 --> 14:15.155
   and you'd be much better off
   with someone else.

14:18.792 --> 14:20.226
Hi, it's Zack.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.128
Look, I'm the one
running the Teen Line,

14:22.162 --> 14:24.197
and you're the only
Kapowski I care about.

14:24.230 --> 14:27.267
 But don't tell your sister,
 we should let her down gently.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.070
  Don't worry, Zack.
  I won't tell Kelly.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.138
Nicki?

14:39.079 --> 14:40.747
( bell rings )

14:43.083 --> 14:44.617
 Where's Mr. Manfredi?

14:44.651 --> 14:47.187
  Yeah.
  How can we have art class
  without a teacher?

14:47.220 --> 14:51.291
 I live! Yes!

14:51.324 --> 14:52.992
 Remember, everybody,

14:53.093 --> 14:57.097
  art is unpredictable.
  Anyway...

14:57.097 --> 14:59.866
so be spontaneous, huh?

15:00.834 --> 15:03.636
Now today we are
going to create

15:03.670 --> 15:08.074
   by observing
   the human figure.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.709
   All: Ooh!

15:09.743 --> 15:10.777
   Enter our models.

15:10.810 --> 15:13.780
 ( applause )

15:17.817 --> 15:20.120
 I thought you said models,
 not pigs.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.125
  Who are you calling a pig?

15:25.158 --> 15:26.760
  I call 'em like I see 'em.

15:27.861 --> 15:29.662
   Yeah.
   All men are pigs.

15:29.696 --> 15:32.399
Yeah?
Well, all women are...

15:32.432 --> 15:33.800
 what are all women?

15:33.833 --> 15:35.135
  More trouble
  than they're worth.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.503
 Boys: Yeah!

15:36.536 --> 15:37.837
 What do you know,
 scuzzbucket?

15:37.871 --> 15:41.441
  Oh, scuzzbucket.
  Yes! Go with your feelings!

15:41.474 --> 15:44.244
Go with your feelings.
Remember, everybody...

15:44.277 --> 15:48.415
   art after all is...
   emotion!

15:48.448 --> 15:51.885
  Everybody live!
  Free yourself, my children!

15:51.918 --> 15:54.554
   Free yourself!
   Be free!

15:54.587 --> 15:58.458
   Hey, hey!
   What is going on here?
   This is madness!

15:58.491 --> 16:02.529
  Yes! Yes!
  And madness
  leads to greatness!

16:02.562 --> 16:04.764
   Dare to be great!

16:07.434 --> 16:09.803
  Everybody cut it out!
  Stop it!

16:09.836 --> 16:12.105
 ( whistles )

16:12.138 --> 16:15.408
  Now who hit me
  in the head with the clay?

16:18.044 --> 16:21.114
 Jessie, can you please tell me
 what's going on here?

16:21.147 --> 16:23.350
Ask Brillo head.
He started it.

16:23.383 --> 16:26.052
  Well, Brillo head?

16:26.052 --> 16:28.288
I mean, Slater.

16:28.321 --> 16:32.792
 Boy, am I glad Teen Line
 told me to stay away from you.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.729
 What?
 They told me to ask you out.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.163
  They told me to dump you.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.565
 They told me the same thing.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.333
 ( muttering )

16:40.367 --> 16:42.602
  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
  Wait a minute.

16:42.635 --> 16:45.238
Who else called
this Teen Line?

16:48.842 --> 16:51.711
 Oh, we didn't need advice,
 you know,

16:51.745 --> 16:54.848
   'cause we're, like, totally
   together dudes, you know?

16:54.881 --> 16:57.083
  All right.
  Everyone can leave.

16:57.083 --> 17:01.554
 Except for
 the spotlessly clean,
 like, totally together dudes.

17:05.392 --> 17:08.328
 You're both
 behind this Teen Line,
 aren't you?

17:08.361 --> 17:10.230
  You can't prove that, sir.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.632
   And even if you could,
   they didn't have
   to listen to us.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.068
  Good one, Screech.

17:15.101 --> 17:19.739
  My school will
  be a happy school
  by noon tomorrow, or else.

17:23.943 --> 17:26.680
  Lisa, you're looking lovelier
  than ever today.

17:26.713 --> 17:30.850
Can the sweet talk.
You're giving me a zit.

17:30.884 --> 17:35.388
 The Teen Line is
 a disaster because
 of all the bad advice I gave.

17:35.422 --> 17:36.723
   I need your help.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.192
 Why should I help you?
 I already have all your money.

17:39.225 --> 17:42.962
  I guess I got greedy
  and things got out of hand.

17:43.063 --> 17:45.065
Well, look on
the bright side, Zack,

17:45.065 --> 17:46.466
 at least you still have Kelly.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.601
  Not if Nicki has anything
  to say about it.

17:49.803 --> 17:51.604
Nicki? What happened?

17:51.638 --> 17:53.973
I mixed up the calls.

17:54.074 --> 17:57.744
   You're pathetic.
   All right, I'll help you.

17:57.777 --> 18:00.814
 You've got to make Nicki think
 you're a disgusting creep.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.382
   H   Well...mean?

18:02.415 --> 18:03.516
Is she gonna help us?

18:03.550 --> 18:04.651
Yeah.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.019
Great!

18:10.123 --> 18:12.392
 You think you can be
 that smooth?

18:14.260 --> 18:17.497
   Okay, now let's put the past
   behind us.

18:17.530 --> 18:20.367
 I mean, you guys are obviously
 attracted to each other.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.668
  But we don't
  agree on anything.

18:21.701 --> 18:22.936
   That's not true.

18:23.036 --> 18:24.938
   Okay...

18:25.038 --> 18:28.141
  but is there anyone
  you'd rather disagree with?

18:29.142 --> 18:30.443
Jessie and Slater: No.

18:30.477 --> 18:31.745
 There! Your first agreement.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.781
 Build on that.
 Next!

18:41.554 --> 18:43.623
  Hi.

18:43.656 --> 18:46.059
You don't look so happy.
Want to talk about it?

18:46.059 --> 18:47.527
No, that's all right.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.062
Okay.

18:49.062 --> 18:51.131
   You weren't supposed
   to leave!

18:51.164 --> 18:53.366
 I was going to the girls' room
 to comb out my hair.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.802
  I would've been back
  in an hour.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.071
I don't know
what to think.

18:58.071 --> 18:59.873
 Jessie said Zack's
 going out with Nicki,

18:59.906 --> 19:02.375
Teen Line said I
should dump him,
but I trust them both.

19:02.409 --> 19:04.811
  Lisa, what's a girl to do?

19:04.844 --> 19:08.181
 First, stop talking
 like <i>The Brady Bunch.</i>

19:08.214 --> 19:10.784
  And then, meet me
  at The Max tonight?

19:10.817 --> 19:13.253
 Come on.
 Here's what we're gonna do...

19:15.155 --> 19:17.824
  Lisa, are you sure
  I have to dress like this?

19:17.857 --> 19:20.393
   I told you,
   if anyone recognizes you,

19:20.427 --> 19:21.928
this is not gonna work.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.697
  Just sit over there,
  and pay attention.

19:23.730 --> 19:24.764
 Okay.

19:24.798 --> 19:25.832
 Bye.

19:37.744 --> 19:41.514
 One grape soda,
 three straws, missy.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.051
  Hi.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.053
 Zack?

19:47.053 --> 19:49.556
  Oh, sorry I'm late.

19:49.589 --> 19:52.959
   That's okay.
   I'd wait forever for you.

19:53.059 --> 19:56.062
Aw...
( goofy laugh )

19:57.697 --> 19:59.199
  Grape soda, three straws.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.700
  Thank you.

20:00.734 --> 20:02.402
Three straws?

20:02.435 --> 20:04.070
  Yeah. That's why I'm late.

20:04.104 --> 20:07.741
You see, I'm spider sitting
for the weekend.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.610
   This is Leonard.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.679
  Ooh!
  He's cute!

20:13.680 --> 20:15.815
He is?

20:15.849 --> 20:18.752
   Well, yeah.
   Leonard loves grape soda.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.422
Wow!
( goofy laugh )

20:23.390 --> 20:25.025
Watch.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.626
Whoop!

20:26.659 --> 20:30.730
   Zack, I have never seen
   this side of you before.

20:30.764 --> 20:33.366
 Well, see, that's why
 I like you, Nicki...

20:33.400 --> 20:34.634
I can be the real me.

20:34.668 --> 20:35.869
 ( bubbling )

20:35.902 --> 20:38.605
  Oh...
  ( slurps )

20:38.638 --> 20:40.707
Ahh.
Hey, do you like worms?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.275
  Yeah. Who doesn't?

20:42.308 --> 20:45.111
 Then I guess you know about
 the lnsect Rodeo this weekend?

20:45.145 --> 20:47.280
   Yeah.
   I've got front-row seats.

20:48.415 --> 20:50.950
  This isn't working.

20:52.952 --> 20:56.423
 Look, Nicki,
 I got to tell you something.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.724
   What is it, Zack?

20:58.792 --> 21:00.326
 I'm in love with...

21:00.360 --> 21:01.828
I knew it! I knew it!

21:01.861 --> 21:04.397
   I'm in love
   with your sister, Kelly.

21:04.431 --> 21:07.434
   You are?

21:07.467 --> 21:10.403
Oh.
So you dressed up like this
to turn me off?

21:10.437 --> 21:13.073
 Yeah.
 Then you understand?

21:13.106 --> 21:16.076
 Yeah, I understand, all right.
 I understand you're a dork

21:16.076 --> 21:18.445
 who couldn't tell
 a 13-year-old girl the truth.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.880
 That is so immature.

21:24.918 --> 21:26.986
Hey there, stud muffin.

21:27.087 --> 21:30.490
I saw you with
the little girl,
and I like your style.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.859
 Why don't we go
 make a Kodak moment?

21:32.892 --> 21:35.528
   Ahem...
   well, I'd like to, miss,

21:35.562 --> 21:37.997
  but I've got
  a great girlfriend,

21:38.098 --> 21:40.166
   and I'm a one-woman guy.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.369
  ( whispers )
  It's Kelly.

21:48.274 --> 21:50.977
 ( instrumental music plays )
