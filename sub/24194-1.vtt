Sadly, the timing
couldn't be worse.

21:28.296 --> 21:31.588
Those code-monkeys
I just hired were right
about one thing:

21:31.588 --> 21:35.171
Making Jack's box
the flagship product
of this company

21:35.171 --> 21:37.795
will send us down a path
to technological irrelevance

21:37.795 --> 21:39.463
from which
we will never return.

21:39.463 --> 21:42.004
But in light of the time
and resources

21:42.004 --> 21:43.546
we've invested
in this product,

21:43.546 --> 21:45.504
convincing the board
and our shareholders

21:45.504 --> 21:47.754
to simply scrap it
will be nearly impossible.

21:47.754 --> 21:50.463
Our company is too big
to turn around that quickly.

21:50.463 --> 21:53.962
Gavin, what if you launched
a new product to help us
correct course?

21:53.962 --> 21:57.504
Absolutely. Look at all
the products you've brought
to market over the years.

21:57.504 --> 21:59.588
Gavin:
Hmm. True.

21:59.588 --> 22:04.504
I did invent the HooliPod
and the HooliPad
and the HooliPad Pro,

22:04.504 --> 22:08.754
but a man only has
so many game-changing
inventions in him.

22:08.754 --> 22:12.421
And technically,
all the products he just
named were money-losers.

22:12.421 --> 22:14.379
I mean, you could argue
we'd have been better off

22:14.379 --> 22:16.712
if he'd never invented
any of that stuff.

22:20.296 --> 22:21.421
Hoover.
Hoover:
Sir.

22:25.421 --> 22:28.296
Patrice, can I talk
to you outside
for a second?

22:31.212 --> 22:35.629
Anyway, if Jack Barker's
insidious box is allowed
to go to market,

22:35.629 --> 22:36.879
we may all lose our jobs.

22:36.879 --> 22:38.296
We may all go
the way of Patrice.

22:38.296 --> 22:41.421
But we must fight it.
We cannot sacrifice

22:41.421 --> 22:45.962
our long-term wellbeing
in the interest of paltry,
short-term profits.

22:45.962 --> 22:48.004
Well, they're
not paltry, exactly.

22:48.004 --> 22:50.795
Did you not see
the preorder figures
for the Box Two?

22:50.795 --> 22:52.629
They came in
this morning.

22:54.795 --> 22:56.254
Holy shit.

22:57.254 --> 23:00.046
Are these right?
How many quarters is this?

23:00.046 --> 23:02.296
Just one.
The Box Two will be by far

23:02.296 --> 23:04.338
the most lucrative new product
we've ever released.

23:06.754 --> 23:08.129
Fucking Sliceline.

23:08.129 --> 23:11.379
Plus his fancy,
hi-tech pizza tastes
just like Domino's.

23:11.379 --> 23:14.421
There's a reason for that.
Check out the liner.

23:14.421 --> 23:17.212
Jared:
Oh yeah.
I guess that's Domino's.

23:17.212 --> 23:19.046
We never had pizza
'cause my step-mom said

23:19.046 --> 23:21.588
Italians aren't
real white people.

23:21.588 --> 23:24.588
Hold on. Duncan doesn't
even make his own pizza?

23:24.588 --> 23:26.504
He just orders it
from Domino's

23:26.504 --> 23:28.129
and switches the boxes?

23:28.129 --> 23:29.795
He really is sneaky.

23:29.795 --> 23:33.129
It's not sneaky.
It's stupid.

23:33.129 --> 23:35.546
Switching boxes costs
a lot of money.

23:35.546 --> 23:37.795
Okay. How do you know?

23:37.795 --> 23:40.129
I need to prove
Errich's dead,

23:40.129 --> 23:43.670
so I want to ship
a dead body from China,

23:43.670 --> 23:47.296
but it's hard to find
a white body in China,

23:47.296 --> 23:49.795

like Errich,

white cadaver

23:53.837 --> 23:55.837

But to ship to China,
then switch box,

23:59.920 --> 24:02.837
