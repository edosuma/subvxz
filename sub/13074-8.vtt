[grunting]

18:31.643 --> 18:32.978
Phew.

18:33.045 --> 18:35.080
[timer ticking]

18:35.147 --> 18:37.182
- If one of you doesn't give,

18:37.249 --> 18:40.452
you're both gonna be crowned the
ultimate baby loser.

18:40.519 --> 18:42.387
both: [gasp]

18:42.454 --> 18:45.157
[laughter]

18:49.595 --> 18:51.296
boing!

18:51.363 --> 18:53.332
- Augh,
that's horrible.

18:53.398 --> 18:57.035
I'm not gonna let my sister be
the worst.

18:57.102 --> 18:58.937
- Foo, what are you doing?

18:59.004 --> 19:01.740
- I'm letting you win the match.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.343
- What?
Oh, no, you don't.

19:04.409 --> 19:06.278
I'm gonna take the fall.

19:06.345 --> 19:08.280
- No.
I can't let you be a loser.

19:08.347 --> 19:09.715
You couldn't handle it.

19:09.781 --> 19:10.949
- You can't handle it.

19:11.016 --> 19:12.818
You're the emotional one.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.419
- No, I'm not.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.521
You are.

19:15.587 --> 19:17.489
- Just give up already.

19:17.556 --> 19:18.857
- Hey, hey, hey.

19:18.924 --> 19:20.425
Keep those elbows on the table,

19:20.492 --> 19:22.694
or else you'll be ejected from
the game.

19:22.761 --> 19:24.029
- Wait a minute.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.264
{\an3}That's it.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.832
Foo, we have to get kicked out.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.767
It's the only way we can make it
out of here

19:28.834 --> 19:30.369
without being embarrassed.

19:30.435 --> 19:32.170
- Are you sure this is gonna
work?

19:32.237 --> 19:34.640
- No.
But do you have a better idea?

19:34.706 --> 19:36.642
- [gnawing]

19:36.708 --> 19:38.377
Nope.

19:38.443 --> 19:40.712
- Hey.
What did I just say?

19:40.779 --> 19:43.582
{\an3}- Ha, looks like you're gonna
have to kick us out.

19:43.649 --> 19:45.183
- You bet I will.

19:45.250 --> 19:48.086
Do that 30 more times and you'll
get yourself a yellow card.

19:48.153 --> 19:50.455
4 of those and you're outta
here.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.458
{\an3}- What?
Ugh, we gotta amp it up.

19:53.525 --> 19:54.793
- Can do.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.429
Whoo!

19:57.496 --> 19:58.830
- [gnawing]

19:58.897 --> 20:00.499
[growling]

20:00.566 --> 20:02.100
- Stop that.

20:02.167 --> 20:04.870
You're seven verbal warnings
away from getting a penalty.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.838
both: Augh.

20:06.905 --> 20:08.407
- Oof!
- Augh!

20:08.473 --> 20:09.708
{\an3}- Oof!

20:09.775 --> 20:13.211
- [speaking gibberish]

20:13.278 --> 20:15.347
- Yeah!
Break the rules!

20:15.414 --> 20:17.382
Oh, listen to me go.

20:17.449 --> 20:18.884
{\an3}- Yah!

20:18.951 --> 20:21.853
- Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!

20:21.920 --> 20:23.589
- Oh, I'm scared.

20:23.655 --> 20:26.191
{\an3}- I've never seen such reckless
arm wrestling.

20:26.258 --> 20:29.595
[laughter]

20:29.661 --> 20:31.563
- [chuckles]

20:31.630 --> 20:32.831
Oof!

20:32.898 --> 20:36.501
- Mm-hmm, interesting strategy.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.837
- Guys,
you're running out of time.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.472
Hurry up and get disqualified.

20:40.539 --> 20:43.375
- Looks like you'll both be
losers.

20:43.442 --> 20:45.877
[laughs]

20:45.944 --> 20:47.946
- No one calls us losers.

20:48.013 --> 20:50.782
Foo, ball.

20:52.718 --> 20:55.053
all: Ahh! Oof! Hey! Oof! Hey!
Augh!

20:55.120 --> 20:58.557
Ugh! Augh! Ugh! Oof! Ugh!

20:58.624 --> 21:01.693
- Oh, no! No!

21:01.760 --> 21:02.761
Dad!

21:02.828 --> 21:05.631
[stammering]
Dad?

21:05.697 --> 21:07.165
He's dead.

21:07.232 --> 21:08.834
[sobbing]
Oh, no.

21:08.900 --> 21:11.103
And it's your fault.

21:11.169 --> 21:14.439
{\an3}You two dinguses are
disqualified.

21:16.441 --> 21:20.812
I can't believe you killed my--
huh?

21:20.879 --> 21:21.913
Dad?

21:21.980 --> 21:23.148
You're alive!

21:23.215 --> 21:25.317
[laughs]

21:25.384 --> 21:27.352
{\an3}He good.
He good.

21:27.419 --> 21:29.421
- Well, guys, you did it.

21:29.488 --> 21:31.556
{\an1}As your coach, I couldn't be
more proud.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.992
- Oh, right, you were our coach.

21:34.059 --> 21:37.663
- Seeing how the dummy babies
were disqualified,

21:37.729 --> 21:41.933
the loser award goes to...
this guy.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.202
- Wait, I--I won something?

21:44.269 --> 21:47.339
[laughter]

21:47.406 --> 21:50.142
- Aw,
Jeremy makes a cute baby.

21:50.208 --> 21:51.943
{\an1}- Come on dudes.
Let's get out of here.

21:52.010 --> 21:55.981
{\an1}So I guess the lesson is, if ya
can't win, then don't play.

21:56.048 --> 22:00.385
- I...I don't know if that's a
good lesson.
