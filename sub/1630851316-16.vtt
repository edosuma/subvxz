WEBVTT

00:09.487 --> 00:12.577
Midnight feedings?
Dirty diapers?

00:12.621 --> 00:14.536
I'm ready, Pop.

00:14.579 --> 00:16.625
Nobody's ready.

00:16.668 --> 00:19.019
Okay, fine. I'm not ready.

00:19.062 --> 00:20.411
But I'm willing and able.

00:20.455 --> 00:22.631
That's my boy.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.720
Reporting for duty.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.417
Isaac.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.332
Where is the skywriter?
He should be here by now.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.595
Lola, I promise,

00:30.639 --> 00:33.468
that plane is gonna spell B-O-Y.

00:33.511 --> 00:36.645
Better spell B-O-Y, because
raising a G-I-R-L is terrifying.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.603
You've seen
how my sisters turned out.

00:38.647 --> 00:41.389
Wait, even you guys really
don't know what you're having?

00:41.432 --> 00:44.044
No, Pops.
That's the point.

00:46.437 --> 00:47.917
All right, I think that
we should call the pilot

00:47.960 --> 00:49.353
or something because weShh!

00:49.397 --> 00:52.008
I hear the plane.
I hear the plane!

01:00.321 --> 01:02.279
Uh, what's that say?

01:02.323 --> 01:04.281
It says you overpaid.

01:05.282 --> 01:07.502
How much this set you back?

01:08.764 --> 01:10.026
What the hell?

01:10.070 --> 01:11.897
What is it?

01:11.941 --> 01:13.290
I don't know, bird poop?

01:18.643 --> 01:19.514
Oh, my God!

01:20.689 --> 01:22.125
Get it off me!

01:22.169 --> 01:24.040
It reeks. What is it?

01:24.084 --> 01:25.433
Looks like some kind of...

01:25.476 --> 01:27.304
skin or something.

01:27.348 --> 01:29.219
- From what?
- I don't know.

01:29.263 --> 01:31.134
I think it's...

01:31.178 --> 01:32.570
human.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.909
Well, that was odd.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.258
What was?

02:08.302 --> 02:10.086
I just passed Curtis Hubley

02:10.130 --> 02:11.696
down by the tech trolls,

02:11.740 --> 02:13.655
and he was wearing
an NCIS employee badge.

02:13.698 --> 02:16.005
Curtis who?
He was
an outside cyber consultant

02:16.048 --> 02:17.702
that we used on a few cases

02:17.746 --> 02:18.616
a couple years back.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.009
Always, uh...

02:20.052 --> 02:21.053
always been kind of an odd guy.

02:21.097 --> 02:22.664
Speaking of odd,

02:22.707 --> 02:24.883
I just got a really weird
message from Parker.

02:24.927 --> 02:26.755
"It rained a body in Norfolk"?

02:26.798 --> 02:28.322
Yeah, I got it, too.

02:28.365 --> 02:30.106
What does it mean?

02:30.150 --> 02:32.761
I think it means he needs
to spell-check his texts.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.197
Hey, yo.

02:34.241 --> 02:35.938
So, does this Bandium
from Parker

02:35.981 --> 02:38.158
actually say it rained a body?

02:38.201 --> 02:40.116
It's obviously a glitch.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.335
Yeah, I'm thinking Parker, uh,

02:41.378 --> 02:43.206
did the voice-to-text option

02:43.250 --> 02:45.295
and, uh, you know,
it translated incorrectly.

02:45.339 --> 02:47.906
What would he have said that
would have turned it into

02:47.950 --> 02:49.908
"It rained a body in Norfolk"?

02:49.952 --> 02:51.083
Maimed?

02:51.127 --> 02:52.955
- Claimed?
- Detained?

02:52.998 --> 02:54.913
Good guesses but all wrong.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.306
This time
the Bandium notification

02:56.350 --> 02:57.916
is correct.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.570
It rained a body from the sky?

02:59.614 --> 03:01.398
Piece by fleshy piece.

03:01.442 --> 03:02.791
How the hell did that happen?

03:02.834 --> 03:03.792
Damn good question.

03:03.835 --> 03:05.359
Let's go find out.

03:08.144 --> 03:09.754
So, other than the plane,

03:09.798 --> 03:11.626
did you see anything else
in the sky?

03:11.669 --> 03:13.367
You mean besides
the human body parts?

03:13.410 --> 03:16.413
Yes, um, another aircraft?

03:16.457 --> 03:20.243
Maybe a helicopter
or... hot air balloon?

03:20.287 --> 03:22.158
You think some sicko was
dropping this stuff on us?

03:22.202 --> 03:24.029
Well, we're, uh,
not exactly sure

03:24.073 --> 03:25.988
what we think yet.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.599
Just tell us exactly
what you saw.

03:28.643 --> 03:30.253
Just the plane.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.342
You don't think
the skywriter did this, do you?

03:32.386 --> 03:34.562
Nope. Just got off the phone
with the pilot.

03:34.605 --> 03:36.259
They record all their flights

03:36.303 --> 03:37.434
for insurance purposes,

03:37.478 --> 03:39.349
and he did not do this.

03:39.393 --> 03:42.047
Did he, uh,
say anything else?

03:42.091 --> 03:44.224
Yes, actually, uh,
he said that he's sorry,

03:44.267 --> 03:45.964
that his smoke pump didn't work.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.578
And congratulations,
that it's a girl.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.842
A baby girl.

03:53.885 --> 03:55.670
What a blessing!

03:55.713 --> 03:57.802
Everybody, it's a girl.

03:57.846 --> 04:00.240
- It's a girl.
- I'm gonna take a shower.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.285
Yes, it's a girl.

04:03.808 --> 04:05.549
Sorry, uh...

04:05.593 --> 04:07.812
She was hoping for a boy.

04:07.856 --> 04:09.640
Sweetie!
It's gonna be fine.

04:12.339 --> 04:15.385
Worst gender-reveal
party ever.

04:16.604 --> 04:18.432
Nick, I don't mean to harp,
but would you please

04:18.475 --> 04:20.390
just mind watching
where you're stepping.

04:20.434 --> 04:22.305
I'm watching, bro.
Really?

04:22.349 --> 04:24.438
Is that why we have
a Torres-sized boot print

04:24.481 --> 04:26.091
in that pile
of superficial fascia?

04:26.135 --> 04:27.354
I bet you didn't think
you were gonna ask that

04:27.397 --> 04:29.443
- when you woke up this morning.
- Oh, gosh.

04:29.486 --> 04:32.620
Yeah, all of this is
fairly decomposed.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.404
Several months, I would say.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.058
We're gonna have to collect
quite a bit of it

04:36.101 --> 04:37.451
if we want any shot

04:37.494 --> 04:39.714
at collecting
a viable DNA sample.

04:40.976 --> 04:43.065
Would a, uh, fingerprint help?

04:48.505 --> 04:51.160
Yeah, I've worked
a lot of strange cases,

04:51.203 --> 04:53.858
but a raining body--
that takes the cake.

04:53.902 --> 04:56.121
Yeah, well, technically,
it's only body fragments.

04:56.165 --> 04:57.471
There's a lot more out there.

04:57.514 --> 04:59.429
Can't get
grosser than this.

04:59.473 --> 05:02.650
Kasie's analyzing that fingertip
that you found as we speak.

05:02.693 --> 05:05.435
But meanwhile, I actually found
something quite interesting.

05:05.479 --> 05:08.177
All of these flesh
chunks are covered

05:08.220 --> 05:09.918
in organic secretion.

05:09.961 --> 05:11.659
Yep, it got grosser.

05:11.702 --> 05:14.270
I'm afraid to ask...

05:14.314 --> 05:16.707
- what kind of organic secretion?
- No idea.

05:16.751 --> 05:19.667
Just sent a sample up to Kasie
to run through Mass Spec.

05:23.497 --> 05:25.847
Speaking of Kasie,
where is she?

05:25.890 --> 05:27.283
She just sent me a text.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.763
Did she find an ID?

05:28.806 --> 05:31.853
All she said was,
"Wine and misdemeanor,"

05:31.896 --> 05:34.421
followed by a couple
of smiley emoji faces.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.336
"Wine and misdemeanor"?

05:36.379 --> 05:38.207
That's what we call
our Friday night get-togethers.

05:38.250 --> 05:41.166
We listen to crime podcasts,
drink a little cabernet.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.777
Or a lot of cabernet,

05:42.820 --> 05:44.387
but that is neither
here nor there. Okay.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.997
Out of all the podcasts
we have listened to,

05:46.041 --> 05:47.695
what's the one
that stuck with you the most?

05:47.738 --> 05:49.392
Easy. <i>
Desperately Seeking Emma.</i>

05:49.436 --> 05:50.524
The Radner case.

05:50.567 --> 05:51.568
Obviously, right?

05:51.612 --> 05:53.918
What's, uh, the Radner case?

05:53.962 --> 05:55.703
Nick, you don't know
who Sam Radner is?

05:55.746 --> 05:58.183
He's the insurance salesman
who used to have all those

05:58.227 --> 06:00.751
really funny commercials on TV.Mm-hmm.

06:00.795 --> 06:02.187
I don't watch TV

06:02.231 --> 06:03.972
or listen to podcasts.

06:04.015 --> 06:05.887
Okay, then let me do
the honors.

06:05.930 --> 06:08.803
Sam's wife Emma
went missing five months ago,

06:08.846 --> 06:11.588
and the police always thought
he was involved somehow.

06:11.632 --> 06:13.547
All circumstantial evidence
pointed to him,

06:13.590 --> 06:14.939
but they could never
arrest him,

06:14.983 --> 06:16.158
because they couldn't find Emma.

06:16.201 --> 06:19.335
Well, now Emma has found us.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.293
You're kidding me.
Mm-hmm.

06:21.337 --> 06:24.296
- That's Emma Radner?
- Mm-hmm. Yep.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.037
Well, it's some of her.

06:26.081 --> 06:27.952
This woman deserves justice.

06:27.996 --> 06:29.954
Oh, hear, hear.

06:29.998 --> 06:31.913
And the good news is,
we are way ahead.

06:31.956 --> 06:34.132
We already know pretty much
everything about this case.

06:34.176 --> 06:35.786
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you know why pieces of her

06:35.830 --> 06:36.918
fell from the sky?

06:36.961 --> 06:38.789
Everything except for that.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.443
Do you know where we can find
the rest of her body?

06:40.487 --> 06:42.271
Or that.

06:42.314 --> 06:43.533
How about cause of death?

06:43.577 --> 06:47.058
What I meant
by "everything" was...

06:47.102 --> 06:49.800
we still have
a lot of work to do.

06:50.758 --> 06:52.542
Yeah.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.551
Emma Radner, 34-year-old

07:01.595 --> 07:02.639
middle school teacher
from Fairfax.

07:02.683 --> 07:04.293
She's been missing
for five months.

07:04.336 --> 07:05.555
Last seen leaving a restaurant

07:05.599 --> 07:07.427
while yelling
at her husband Sam.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.952
Yelling about what?

07:10.995 --> 07:12.606
Emma caught Sam liking

07:12.649 --> 07:14.956
his ex-girlfriend's photos
on Facebook.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.348
That'll do it.

07:16.392 --> 07:18.612
Hours later,
Sam drove to Florida

07:18.655 --> 07:20.440
on an impromptu
business trip.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.659
Never talked to his wife once
while he was gone.

07:22.703 --> 07:24.269
Well, I'm not married,
but that sounds like

07:24.313 --> 07:25.880
dog house territory.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.447
No, that's more like
"pack your bags

07:27.490 --> 07:28.883
and find a new house"
territory.

07:28.926 --> 07:30.798
Three days later,

07:30.841 --> 07:33.496
Sam returned home and
Emma was nowhere to be found.

07:33.540 --> 07:36.630
He told the police that he had
no idea what happened to Emma.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.893
Then he lawyered up
and never spoke again.

07:38.936 --> 07:40.285
So, you don't believe him?

07:40.329 --> 07:41.765
No way.

07:41.809 --> 07:43.071
And if you listened
to the podcast,

07:43.114 --> 07:45.116
you wouldn't either.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.249
Okay, are we letting podcasts
run our investigations now?

07:47.292 --> 07:49.469
No, of course not.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.255
But the info on this podcast
is legit.

07:53.298 --> 07:55.475
Cops even participated

07:55.518 --> 07:57.781
to help raise awareness
about Emma's disappearance.

07:57.825 --> 07:59.522
Mc
I took a look at

07:59.566 --> 08:01.089
the original police reports.

08:01.132 --> 08:02.656
They, uh, always suspected
foul play,

08:02.699 --> 08:04.745
and Sam was prime suspect
from day one.

08:04.788 --> 08:07.922
He was the last person to see
her alive before he left town.

08:07.965 --> 08:11.578
And he had his truck
washed and detailed

08:11.621 --> 08:14.145
the day he got back
from Florida.

08:14.189 --> 08:17.061
He lost his job, but he
didn't lose his freedom,

08:17.105 --> 08:18.846
because without a body

08:18.889 --> 08:20.674
they didn't have enough
evidence to arrest him.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.197
We have a body.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.546
Sort of.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.287
All right, then pick him up.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.811
I assume you'd like
to do the honors, Knight.

08:27.855 --> 08:30.074
- It would be my pleasure.
- McI'll go with you.

08:30.118 --> 08:33.338
Oh, and let's, uh, be sure
to notify the next of kin.

08:33.382 --> 08:34.905
The sister,
- what's her name?
- Molly.

08:34.949 --> 08:36.733
She lives right across
the street from the Radners.

08:36.777 --> 08:40.650
Uh, Molly was on vacation
when Emma disappeared. Ugh.

08:40.694 --> 08:43.305
They were best friends.
They did everything together.

08:43.348 --> 08:45.481
Thanks, Kase.
A valuable nugget.

08:48.310 --> 08:50.965
In my heart,
I still had hope.

08:52.575 --> 08:54.142
But in my gut, I...

08:54.185 --> 08:56.405
I knew she was gone.

08:56.448 --> 08:57.972
We're sorry for your loss.

08:58.015 --> 08:59.887
Sam.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.889
I can't believe I actually
loved him like a brother.

09:01.932 --> 09:04.326
He had us all fooled.

09:04.369 --> 09:07.372
I hope that bastard fries.

09:07.416 --> 09:09.157
So, you believe
that he killed her?

09:09.200 --> 09:11.725
Obviously he killed her.

09:11.768 --> 09:13.509
Their marriage was toxic
the last couple years.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.380
All they did was fight.

09:15.424 --> 09:16.773
I bet he finally just...

09:16.817 --> 09:18.427
snapped.

09:21.343 --> 09:23.954
Promise me you won't
let him get away with this.

09:31.701 --> 09:32.702
- We got your message,
- Molly.

09:33.964 --> 09:37.577
Oh, honey, what can we do?

09:37.620 --> 09:39.753
There's nothing you can do.

09:41.232 --> 09:42.712
Excuse me, you guys are...?

09:42.756 --> 09:44.714
Walt Freeman.
This is my wife...

09:44.758 --> 09:46.150
KNIGHT:Nance.

09:47.412 --> 09:49.371
Old family friends of Emma's.

09:49.414 --> 09:52.896
Both girls are family.

09:52.940 --> 09:55.551
Molly just called
and told us that Emma's...

09:57.684 --> 09:59.599
I hadn't gone on vacation
in years.

09:59.642 --> 10:02.602
If I had been here, maybe I...

10:04.865 --> 10:07.650
Sam's still living there
in my sister's house

10:07.694 --> 10:09.652
as if nothing ever happened.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.349
Well, that's about to change.

10:11.393 --> 10:13.656
You finally gonna arrest him?

10:13.700 --> 10:15.745
We just knocked on his door,
and he didn't answer,

10:15.789 --> 10:17.834
and the door was locked.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.793
But we left an agent outside,
and as soon as he comes home,

10:19.836 --> 10:21.142
we're gonna bring him in
for questioning.

10:22.143 --> 10:23.927
He's home now.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.799
Watching us.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.539
If you want to go
get the bastard,

10:27.583 --> 10:29.193
I have the key.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.851
True crime podcasts?

10:34.895 --> 10:36.679
You know, I get the appeal
for regular people

10:36.723 --> 10:38.855
but not for us.
Why not?

10:38.899 --> 10:41.292
I'm a fan of a good old whodunit
from time to time.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.599
Yeah, but we deal
with murders all day.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.731
Why would we want
to do it at night?

10:44.774 --> 10:46.689
It's like an accountant, uh,

10:46.733 --> 10:48.473
listening to a podcast
about crunching numbers.

10:48.517 --> 10:50.693
Well, I figured you'd
at least be a fan

10:50.737 --> 10:52.521
of that one podcast,
since it's all about

10:52.564 --> 10:54.871
your old NCIS investigation.

10:54.915 --> 10:57.265
Oh, you work fast, Kasie.
What do you got for us?

10:57.308 --> 10:59.267
Hold on, hold on.
Why didn't anyone tell me

10:59.310 --> 11:01.356
there was a podcast about us?

11:01.399 --> 11:04.446
Uh, well, how did you not know
there was a podcast about us?

11:04.489 --> 11:06.448
You heard it?
Which case?

11:06.491 --> 11:08.450
Uh, it's that one
from a few years back,

11:08.493 --> 11:09.799
where a petty officer had

11:09.843 --> 11:11.845
his brake line cut
by that senator.

11:11.888 --> 11:14.195
- Blah, blah, blah.
- Hey, that's my case.

11:14.238 --> 11:15.500
Is it?
Yeah.

11:15.544 --> 11:17.241
I interviewed the victim.

11:17.285 --> 11:18.765
I made the collar,
and I got the confession.

11:18.808 --> 11:21.550
I mean, it was legendary.
I saw it like a...

11:21.593 --> 11:22.986
like <i>The Matrix,</i> you know?

11:23.030 --> 11:24.814
Everything just kind of
lined up and-- you know?

11:24.858 --> 11:26.686
Uh, we're gonna have to
circle back to that, Nick,

11:26.729 --> 11:29.906
because I have something that
will make this case legendary.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.734
I figured out

11:31.778 --> 11:33.693
how Emma rained from the sky.

11:34.911 --> 11:36.434
Vultures.

11:36.478 --> 11:37.435
Vultures?

11:37.479 --> 11:39.307
I analyzed the secretion

11:39.350 --> 11:40.656
Jimmy found
on the body parts.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.876
Turns out, it was
stomach bile.

11:42.919 --> 11:45.487
Stomach bile from vultures?

11:45.530 --> 11:47.750
Yep, I found
this vulture feather

11:47.794 --> 11:48.882
on one of the pieces of flesh
you bagged.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.579
Of course.

11:50.622 --> 11:53.451
Vultures regurgitate
as a defense mechanism.

11:53.495 --> 11:54.714
You just know that?

11:54.757 --> 11:56.759
I'm a fan of fowl.

11:56.803 --> 11:59.588
But if they were
flying through clouds

11:59.631 --> 12:02.765
and then nearly collided
with a skywriting plane, then...

12:02.809 --> 12:04.767
They'd be scared enough
to vomit. Ah...

12:04.811 --> 12:06.900
The vultures
must've discovered

12:06.943 --> 12:08.684
Emma's body
and eaten the remains.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.294
Kasie, I'm pretty sure

12:10.338 --> 12:12.557
that vultures nest close
to their food source.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.472
That is exactly

12:14.516 --> 12:15.952
what The Wildlife Society told
me when I called them.

12:15.996 --> 12:17.562
If we find the vulture,
we find the body.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.390
Did you ask Wildlife

12:19.434 --> 12:21.566
if they're still tagging
the locals with GPS chips?

12:21.610 --> 12:23.568
As a matter of fact, I did.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.919
I've already got the tech trolls
working on the coordinates.

12:25.962 --> 12:27.790
Whew, that's a lot of steps.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.575
The GPS coordinates
you asked for, Ms. Hines.

12:30.619 --> 12:31.663
Sorry it took so long.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.491
I had to run up the stairs.

12:33.535 --> 12:36.059
Uh... it's Kasie,

12:36.103 --> 12:37.713
and what ever happened to email?

12:37.757 --> 12:39.193
And the elevator?

12:39.236 --> 12:40.760
Pardon?

12:40.803 --> 12:42.370
It's just...

12:42.413 --> 12:44.851
the cyber division
usually sends things,

12:44.894 --> 12:47.331
you know, electronically.

12:47.375 --> 12:48.724
Cyber.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.726
Makes sense. I'm new.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.946
Curtis Hubley, the new guy.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.948
So the elevator's not broken,
then?

12:54.991 --> 12:57.124
Uh, no, Curtis.

12:57.167 --> 12:59.604
And, uh, I think
you're being hazed.

13:00.605 --> 13:01.998
Me, too.

13:02.042 --> 13:04.000
But I kind of like it.

13:04.044 --> 13:06.133
I was told to get a notarized
receipt for that file.

13:07.395 --> 13:08.918
Not a thing?

13:13.880 --> 13:15.577
Who was that guy?

13:15.620 --> 13:17.187
Somebody else's problem.

13:17.231 --> 13:19.624
But he did bring us
the coordinates

13:19.668 --> 13:20.930
for those tracking chips.

13:22.627 --> 13:25.717
Okay, the chips are geolocated
in Twin Rivers Park,

13:25.761 --> 13:27.545
south of Yorkville.

13:27.589 --> 13:29.547
Torres, you up for a hike?

13:29.591 --> 13:31.375
I wear my boots to work.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.638
I'll take that as a yes.
Thanks, Kasie.

13:38.861 --> 13:39.819
And that's when,

13:39.862 --> 13:41.559
all thanks to the hard work

13:41.603 --> 13:43.431
of Special Agent Timothy McGee,

13:43.474 --> 13:45.868
NCIS was finally able
to identify

13:45.912 --> 13:47.174
and catch the killer... Torres.

13:47.217 --> 13:48.958
- and bring justice to the family.
- Torres!

13:49.002 --> 13:50.481
Yeah?

13:50.525 --> 13:52.440
Maybe take a break
from that case

13:52.483 --> 13:55.008
and focus on this one.

13:55.051 --> 13:56.879
- Yeah, yeah, you're right.
- Thank you.

13:56.923 --> 13:59.577
And keep your eyes peeled
for, uh...

13:59.621 --> 14:01.492
Yeah, bird doo-doo. Got it.

14:01.536 --> 14:04.017
Not bird doo-doo,
vulture guano,

14:04.060 --> 14:07.716
which is known
for its distinct aroma.

14:07.759 --> 14:10.414
Man, this podcast keeps talking
about McGee, McGee, McGee,

14:10.458 --> 14:13.896
and it-- uh, they-they rarely
mention, by the way,

14:13.940 --> 14:15.985
rarely mention me,
and when they do,

14:16.029 --> 14:18.945
they call me Special Agent,
uh, Flores.

14:18.988 --> 14:21.077
Well, life's a bitch.

14:21.121 --> 14:22.600
I'm not listening to
next week's episode.

14:22.644 --> 14:24.254
I beg you not to.

14:24.298 --> 14:25.952
Hey, is that, uh...

14:25.995 --> 14:27.649
vulture crap?

14:27.692 --> 14:29.390
It is.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.914
Good eyes, Flores.

14:31.958 --> 14:34.177
Means we're near the nest.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.485
So, birds are
your thing, huh?

14:37.528 --> 14:39.879
No, hobbies are my thing.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.837
This year it was ornithology.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.274
But I never thought
it would help solve a murder.

14:44.318 --> 14:47.277
You know, vultures are
actually quite a bird.

14:47.321 --> 14:49.889
You know they never really
kill anything themselves?

14:49.932 --> 14:51.847
They only feed off
the carcasses of the dead.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.022
Really?

14:53.066 --> 14:54.545
Yeah.

14:54.589 --> 14:56.852
And when a group of vultures
gather in a tree,

14:56.896 --> 14:58.332
heads hung low,
ready to go eat,

14:58.375 --> 14:59.333
it's called a wake.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.076
You mean like that?

15:05.382 --> 15:07.689
Yes, exactly like that.

15:07.732 --> 15:10.039
There's food nearby.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.041
Emma's body.

15:14.174 --> 15:18.091
But if she's been here
for five months...

15:18.134 --> 15:19.614
why would they wait
until now to eat her?

15:19.657 --> 15:21.050
It was winter.

15:21.094 --> 15:22.791
Would have frozen
and only recently thawed.

15:25.359 --> 15:27.796
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, hold up, hold up.

15:28.797 --> 15:29.929
Right there.

15:42.289 --> 15:43.681
That's Emma.

15:45.814 --> 15:47.250
Sam Radner?

15:47.294 --> 15:48.686
NCIS!

15:48.730 --> 15:50.166
Our agent is
with your sister-in-law!

15:50.210 --> 15:51.646
She told us you're in here!

15:51.689 --> 15:54.518
I've got a warrant!

15:54.562 --> 15:55.998
I'm coming in!

16:07.096 --> 16:08.402
Sam?

16:09.838 --> 16:12.972
Special Agent Knight, NCIS.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.408
Don't come up here.

16:16.714 --> 16:18.760
I'm afraid I have to, Sam.

16:18.803 --> 16:21.154
I want to be left alone.

16:21.197 --> 16:23.591
I have a few questions
I need to ask you.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.941
I said, leave me alone.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.959
You found Emma's body,
didn't you?

16:48.833 --> 16:50.444
That's what I thought.

16:50.487 --> 16:51.749
Sam.

16:53.447 --> 16:54.796
Don't do this.

16:54.839 --> 16:57.016
Or what? You're gonna shoot me?

16:57.059 --> 16:59.453
Go ahead. Do me a favor.

17:09.506 --> 17:10.507
Lower the gun.

17:10.551 --> 17:12.205
I can't do that.

17:12.248 --> 17:13.554
Sure you can.

17:13.597 --> 17:16.252
I can't keep living like this.

17:18.907 --> 17:20.909
I miss her.

17:22.171 --> 17:24.043
And I'm so worn out.

17:25.435 --> 17:27.350
Everybody thinks
I'm guilty anyway,

17:27.394 --> 17:29.396
so just...

17:29.439 --> 17:31.920
just walk away
and let me do this.

17:31.963 --> 17:33.835
Sorry, I can't do that.

17:33.878 --> 17:36.620
Then I'd close your eyes.

17:36.664 --> 17:39.188
Why? I'd still
be able to hear it.

17:40.624 --> 17:43.236
That's actually the worst part
about it, the sound.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.370
Then, my apologies in advance.

17:47.414 --> 17:49.981
So, that's it? No final words?

17:50.025 --> 17:52.897
What is there to say?

17:52.941 --> 17:55.335
Well, you could say
that you're innocent.

17:55.378 --> 17:57.598
As far as I know,
you haven't said anything.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.730
That's on advice
from my lawyers.

17:59.774 --> 18:02.124
Okay, fair enough.

18:02.168 --> 18:04.083
Fair?

18:05.780 --> 18:07.303
There's no point in me talking

18:07.347 --> 18:09.610
because that podcast has
already said it all.

18:09.653 --> 18:11.525
Yeah.

18:11.568 --> 18:13.048
It did say a lot.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.138
Oh, so you... you heard it?

18:19.098 --> 18:21.709
Then why are you so desperate
to save my life?

18:21.752 --> 18:24.277
Because like everybody else,

18:24.320 --> 18:27.323
you deserve a fair trial.

18:27.367 --> 18:29.934
Fair.

18:29.978 --> 18:32.198
See, there's that word again.

18:34.200 --> 18:37.638
Now, how in the hell am I
supposed to get a fair trial?

18:37.681 --> 18:40.162
So, you're not even
gonna try to fight?

18:40.206 --> 18:41.859
You're just gonna shoot
yourself now,

18:41.903 --> 18:43.339
die a wife killer,

18:43.383 --> 18:45.298
and that's the big plan?

18:45.341 --> 18:47.517
You got a better one?

18:47.561 --> 18:50.303
You said that nobody wants
to hear your side of the story,

18:50.346 --> 18:52.000
but I do.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.959
So if you are ready to talk,

18:55.003 --> 18:57.005
I am ready to listen.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.140
Drop the gun and talk to me

19:01.183 --> 19:02.793
for a few minutes.

19:02.837 --> 19:05.361
At this point,
what do you have to lose?

19:11.498 --> 19:13.500
Agent McGee.

19:13.543 --> 19:15.110
How long has she been alone
in there with him?

19:15.154 --> 19:17.156
- Not long.
- Any updates?

19:17.199 --> 19:19.897
Uh, not since Knight texted me
that Radner has a gun,

19:19.941 --> 19:21.769
but she said she has
the situation under control.

19:21.812 --> 19:23.597
Well, I appreciate
her optimism,

19:23.640 --> 19:25.294
but as long as he's got a gun,
there is no control.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.209
Excuse me? Director Vance?

19:27.253 --> 19:29.777
- Yes.
- I have one team in position and another en route.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.474
Whatever you need from us,
just say the word.

19:31.518 --> 19:32.954
Will do, Captain. Thank you.

19:32.997 --> 19:34.260
We're placing our top sniper

19:34.303 --> 19:36.000
on the northwest
neighbor's roof.

19:36.044 --> 19:37.828
He'll be ready to take Radner... Understood,

19:37.872 --> 19:40.222
but for now,
I need your team to stand down.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.790
Director,
with all due respect,

19:42.833 --> 19:45.184
we've been working this case
for over five months.

19:45.227 --> 19:47.360
We know exactly
what Sam Radner is capable of.

19:47.403 --> 19:50.537
And I know what my agent
inside that house is capable of.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.495
We're gonna give her a chance
to solve this peacefully.

19:52.539 --> 19:55.585
NCIS took this over
at your department's request,

19:55.629 --> 19:57.935
so we will handle this our way.

20:02.810 --> 20:04.594
They're eager.

20:04.638 --> 20:07.075
Yeah, it's personal
for Virginia State Police.

20:07.118 --> 20:09.556
Months of manpower
and nothing to show for it.

20:09.599 --> 20:11.514
But this is our case now,
we're gonna handle this our way.

20:11.558 --> 20:12.733
Can you text her?

20:12.776 --> 20:14.430
I can try.

20:14.474 --> 20:16.171
Tell her she's got ten minutes.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.433
After that,
if he's still armed,

20:17.477 --> 20:18.521
she needs to get
the hell out of there.

20:18.565 --> 20:20.175
All right, I'll tell her,

20:20.219 --> 20:21.872
but I'm not so sure
she's gonna like that.

20:21.916 --> 20:24.832
I don't care. I'm not gonna lose
a suspect or an agent today.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.790
All right.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.626
I know what you're doing.

20:36.670 --> 20:38.889
You mean having
a casual conversation

20:38.933 --> 20:40.456
with a suicidal suspect?

20:40.500 --> 20:43.677
You're keeping me talking.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.592
It's a crisis tactic.

20:47.637 --> 20:51.206
I majored in criminal justice
for a semester at Rutgers.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.513
Then you know
what the protocol is.

20:53.556 --> 20:57.081
You know I can't enter the room
until you put the gun down.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.649
Come on, Sam.
Work with me here.

21:13.184 --> 21:15.317
So, how come you ended up a,

21:15.361 --> 21:17.580
an insurance salesman
instead of a cop?

21:17.624 --> 21:18.755
You're doing it again.

21:18.799 --> 21:20.191
Doing what?

21:20.235 --> 21:22.281
Baiting me into talking.

21:22.324 --> 21:24.370
I was curious,
so I asked the question.

21:24.413 --> 21:26.633
But, yeah, Sam, you're right.

21:26.676 --> 21:28.722
I'd rather keep you talking

21:28.765 --> 21:31.246
than end up doing
something that you can't undo.

21:33.161 --> 21:34.684
What do you want to know?

21:34.728 --> 21:37.034
Tell me about Emma.

21:37.078 --> 21:39.298
That podcast...

21:39.341 --> 21:41.865
made it sound like
all we ever did was fight.

21:44.085 --> 21:46.827
It never mentioned
any of the good stuff.

21:46.870 --> 21:50.483
Then, tell me about
the good stuff.

21:50.526 --> 21:53.399
How often do you think I get
to hear about the good stuff?

21:55.836 --> 21:59.318
Sometimes she would surprise me
with breakfast in bed.

22:01.494 --> 22:03.757
Banana pancakes.

22:03.800 --> 22:07.761
They were almost...
almost always burnt.

22:07.804 --> 22:09.719
Emma couldn't cook,

22:09.763 --> 22:13.070
but in an odd way,
that was sort of the appeal.

22:15.638 --> 22:19.555
Her doing something
she totally hated to do,

22:19.599 --> 22:21.340
just for me.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.167
And how'd you return the favor?

22:23.211 --> 22:25.344
I bought her flowers.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.696
Peonies.

22:29.739 --> 22:32.351
She loved them.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.222
Every once in a while,

22:34.265 --> 22:36.442
she'd take one from the bouquet
and she'd put it...

22:36.485 --> 22:39.314
She'd wear it behind her ear.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.925
I loved it
when she did that.

22:41.969 --> 22:43.536
What else did you do for her?

22:43.579 --> 22:45.407
Ballroom danced.

22:47.061 --> 22:50.238
Believe me, that was...
that was a big deal.

22:52.153 --> 22:55.417
Because I hated dancing even
more than she hated cooking.

22:55.461 --> 22:57.158
But that didn't matter.

22:57.201 --> 22:59.421
So I mambo'd my ass off.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.554
Horribly.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.166
It was brutal.

23:05.209 --> 23:06.907
Well, you know,
nothing says love

23:06.950 --> 23:09.562
like a little awkward dancing
and some crappy pancakes.

23:11.999 --> 23:15.524
Which is why that podcast
failed to mention any of that.

23:18.353 --> 23:20.660
It didn't fit their narrative.

23:20.703 --> 23:22.836
Actually, there are a lot people
on social media

23:22.879 --> 23:24.403
who don't think
that you're guilty.

23:26.230 --> 23:27.928
What about you, Agent Knight?

23:32.106 --> 23:34.456
Did you think
I murdered my wife?

23:35.544 --> 23:37.372
Yes.

23:38.373 --> 23:39.809
What about now?

23:39.853 --> 23:42.246
And now...

23:44.248 --> 23:47.426
...I want you to at least have
the chance to prove me wrong.

23:51.255 --> 23:54.563
All right. Thanks, McGee,
keep us updated.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.522
Knight's still in the house
with Radner.

23:56.565 --> 23:58.262
Radner's still got a gun.

23:58.306 --> 23:59.742
Then why are we not
hauling ass over there

23:59.786 --> 24:02.528
- and take him out?
- Because Knight asked us not to.

24:02.571 --> 24:04.007
Knight's not in charge.

24:04.051 --> 24:05.792
No, but Vance is,

24:05.835 --> 24:07.924
and he's decided to do it
her way, at least for now.

24:07.968 --> 24:11.101
Look, I know it's hard
to just sit back and wait,

24:11.145 --> 24:13.147
but Knight's done this
a thousand times before.

24:13.190 --> 24:14.583
She'll talk Radner down.

24:14.627 --> 24:16.237
I really don't think

24:16.280 --> 24:17.543
Radner's walking out
of that house alive.

24:17.586 --> 24:18.805
Neither do I.

24:18.848 --> 24:20.371
Why?

24:20.415 --> 24:22.635
Uh, I took a closer look

24:22.678 --> 24:24.680
at the area where
Emma's body was dumped,

24:24.724 --> 24:26.508
and I found
something interesting.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.684
There's a trail less
than a quarter mile

24:28.728 --> 24:30.120
from the spot
you found Emma.

24:30.164 --> 24:31.295
What kind of trail?

24:31.339 --> 24:33.646
Off-roading.
Dirt bikes. ATVs.

24:33.689 --> 24:36.257
Tell me that our guy,
uh, has a hobby.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.998
Radner's been riding ATVs

24:38.041 --> 24:39.086
since back in high school.

24:39.129 --> 24:40.435
And that trail is

24:40.479 --> 24:41.828
his favorite place to ride.

24:41.871 --> 24:44.831
And now that we found
Emma's body right next to it,

24:44.874 --> 24:47.050
he has to know that
it's only a matter of time

24:47.094 --> 24:49.444
- before we connect the dots.
- Oh, he knows he's screwed.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.403
So that means Knight is
alone with Radner...

24:52.447 --> 24:54.623
And Radner's got
nothing to lose.

24:57.626 --> 24:59.323
You know, you're
the first person

24:59.367 --> 25:01.195
who's actually called me
guilty to my face?

25:01.238 --> 25:03.806
I respect your honesty.

25:03.850 --> 25:05.416
Well, I didn't want
to lie to you.

25:05.460 --> 25:07.114
Appreciate that.

25:07.157 --> 25:12.467
Although calling a guy
with a gun a wife killer

25:12.511 --> 25:15.514
is definitely not what
they teach you at the academy.

25:15.557 --> 25:17.820
How would you know?
You never even made it there.

25:20.344 --> 25:22.259
Touché.

25:22.303 --> 25:24.305
I don't know if you can,
uh, tell,

25:24.348 --> 25:25.654
but it's been a minute

25:25.698 --> 25:27.351
since I've been
in a standoff like this.

25:27.395 --> 25:29.266
I can,

25:29.310 --> 25:30.964
but you're doing fine.

25:31.007 --> 25:32.531
Thanks.

25:37.797 --> 25:39.755
Look, Sam.

25:39.799 --> 25:43.193
I know the media hasn't
treated you fairly.

25:43.237 --> 25:44.891
And even as a federal agent,

25:44.934 --> 25:47.067
I can't say
that I didn't buy into it.

25:47.110 --> 25:50.592
But guilty or not,

25:50.636 --> 25:53.421
jumping to judgment,
that was wrong.

25:53.464 --> 25:54.857
And I should have known better.

25:54.901 --> 25:57.643
And you definitely
deserve better.

26:01.734 --> 26:03.779
I can fight to get you
a fair trial.

26:05.825 --> 26:08.436
But you got to get up
and walk out that door with me.

26:08.479 --> 26:10.569
That is the only way
I can help you.

26:13.093 --> 26:16.096
Come on, Sam.

26:16.139 --> 26:17.880
You got to trust me.

26:17.924 --> 26:20.579
I mean, you do trust me,
right?

26:21.754 --> 26:23.582
I do trust you.

26:23.625 --> 26:26.149
Then let's walk out of here.

26:26.193 --> 26:29.762
I trust that you'll tell
the entire world my last words.

26:33.853 --> 26:35.550
I'm innocent.

26:36.769 --> 26:38.205
Sam, no!

26:49.738 --> 26:50.913
You know,
you should be thankful.

26:50.957 --> 26:53.002
Agent Knight saved your life.

26:53.046 --> 26:56.223
A miracle the bullet
only grazed your head.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.619
Sure you're okay?

27:00.662 --> 27:02.664
I'm fine, Director, really.

27:02.708 --> 27:04.579
You did a good job,
Agent Knight.

27:05.885 --> 27:08.235
Doing a good job would've meant
he never pulled that trigger.

27:08.278 --> 27:10.019
Hey!

27:10.063 --> 27:11.412
You killed my sister!

27:11.455 --> 27:12.848
You son of a bitch!

27:12.892 --> 27:14.763
You killed my sister!
Molly.

27:14.807 --> 27:17.505
Molly, Molly.
- Come on, come on.
- You killed Emma!

27:17.548 --> 27:19.638
Come on, come on, Molly... Sam, I hope you will rot
in hell, you hear me?

27:19.681 --> 27:20.856
You hear me?
I hope you rot!

27:20.900 --> 27:22.205
Okay, go home, sweetheart.
Come on.

27:22.249 --> 27:24.207
You'll pay for this!

27:24.251 --> 27:25.644
We all knew you were guilty!

27:25.687 --> 27:26.993
Director.

27:27.036 --> 27:28.690
Get Radner out of here

27:28.734 --> 27:29.735
before we have another murder
on our hands.

27:36.916 --> 27:39.701
Hospital just gave Sam Radner
the all-clear.

27:39.745 --> 27:42.486
McGee's escorting him back
to NCIS as we speak.

27:42.530 --> 27:44.314
Well, that's good to hear.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.099
You know what else
would be good?

27:46.142 --> 27:48.449
A little something I could use
in interrogation.

27:48.492 --> 27:49.668
How about cause of death?

27:49.711 --> 27:51.017
Read my mind.

27:51.060 --> 27:54.324
Speaking of minds--
or heads, that is--

27:54.368 --> 27:55.717
uh,
these two cranial contusions

27:55.761 --> 27:56.979
along with a hairline fracture

27:57.023 --> 27:58.502
on her scapula,

27:58.546 --> 27:59.982
broken tibia

28:00.026 --> 28:02.115
all point to blunt force trauma.

28:02.158 --> 28:03.638
From what?

28:03.682 --> 28:05.858
Well, her injury pattern is
very consistent

28:05.901 --> 28:07.468
with a fall of some kind.

28:07.511 --> 28:09.209
Well, we know the Radners
argued a lot.

28:09.252 --> 28:10.732
Maybe things got physical,

28:10.776 --> 28:13.300
Sam snaps,
punches Emma in the head,

28:13.343 --> 28:15.302
shoved her down the stairs.

28:15.345 --> 28:16.782
Based on her injuries,

28:16.825 --> 28:18.958
I'd say that's
a probable theory.

28:19.001 --> 28:21.656
And then he puts her body
in the back of his truck...

28:21.700 --> 28:24.267
Dumps her in the woods
in an area he's familiar with.

28:24.311 --> 28:26.792
And just to be safe, he has
his truck professionally cleaned

28:26.835 --> 28:28.532
right after his trip to Florida.

28:28.576 --> 28:30.143
This probable theory

28:30.186 --> 28:32.232
just keeps getting more
and more probable.

28:34.190 --> 28:35.365
It's McGee.

28:35.409 --> 28:37.150
They have Radner
in interrogation.

28:37.193 --> 28:38.020
Showtime.

28:42.285 --> 28:44.244
I loved my wife.

28:44.287 --> 28:46.376
And she loved me, too.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.944
Then why was she thinking about
leaving you?

28:50.729 --> 28:52.687
She wasn't. Who told you that?

28:52.731 --> 28:54.602
Her therapist.

28:54.645 --> 28:56.169
Up until now,
she wouldn't break

28:56.212 --> 28:58.258
her doctor-patient privilege.

28:58.301 --> 28:59.650
Because Emma could
have been alive.

28:59.694 --> 29:01.522
But she wasn't.

29:01.565 --> 29:03.524
And when we finally
found her body,

29:03.567 --> 29:04.960
her therapist told us

29:05.004 --> 29:07.267
that Emma was considering
divorcing you.

29:07.310 --> 29:08.877
Is that why you killed her?

29:11.750 --> 29:13.360
Because you couldn't live
without her?

29:15.231 --> 29:17.146
You know, you're right.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.763
I can't live without her.

29:29.506 --> 29:31.944
But I didn't kill my wife.

29:35.469 --> 29:38.602
Five months of not speaking
without a lawyer,

29:38.646 --> 29:40.822
and now Radner's pleading
his case?

29:40.866 --> 29:43.390
You definitely had
an effect on him.

29:43.433 --> 29:45.784
Got to say,
he's a hell of an actor.

29:45.827 --> 29:48.395
I'm not so sure he's acting.

29:48.438 --> 29:50.136
You and Ms. Hines

29:50.179 --> 29:51.964
thought he was guilty
from the beginning.

29:53.661 --> 29:55.576
So, what happened
in that house?

29:55.619 --> 29:56.795
He said he was innocent.

29:56.838 --> 29:58.535
Don't they all?

29:58.579 --> 30:00.755
And most of the time,
they're lying.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.627
But the look in his eye,

30:03.671 --> 30:05.542
that told me he wasn't.

30:09.503 --> 30:11.505
Kasie. She has something.

30:11.548 --> 30:13.376
Go.

30:16.989 --> 30:19.208
What took you so long?

30:19.252 --> 30:20.949
You just texted me
three minutes ago.

30:20.993 --> 30:23.038
Oh, really?
Felt like a lot longer.

30:23.082 --> 30:25.780
Probably because I have got
something big.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.869
You remember episode three

30:27.913 --> 30:29.784
- of the podcast?
- The flower episode?

30:29.828 --> 30:31.264
Bingo! Okay.

30:31.307 --> 30:33.048
So, Sam sent Emma
a bouquet of flowers

30:33.092 --> 30:34.571
from Florida.

30:34.615 --> 30:36.138
Peonies.

30:36.182 --> 30:38.140
The cops' theory was
that Sam killed her

30:38.184 --> 30:39.838
and then sent her the flowers

30:39.881 --> 30:41.361
to pretend like
he didn't know she was dead.

30:41.404 --> 30:43.145
Yeah, well, I just finished
testing and logging

30:43.189 --> 30:44.755
all the debris found on Emma,

30:44.799 --> 30:46.540
and discovered a substance

30:46.583 --> 30:48.368
above her left ear.

30:48.411 --> 30:49.978
Pollen residue.

30:50.022 --> 30:51.284
Well, she was in the woods
for five months,

30:51.327 --> 30:52.285
so that would make sense.

30:53.547 --> 30:55.070
But you did not
call me down here

30:55.114 --> 30:56.419
- because that makes sense.
- Ooh.

30:56.463 --> 30:58.857
You know me so well.

31:01.381 --> 31:04.036
The residue wasn't from a tree.
It was from a flower.

31:04.079 --> 31:05.907
Please tell me that's
a dead peony.

31:08.127 --> 31:10.216
That it is,
and I do not have to tell you

31:10.259 --> 31:11.739
this overpriced flower

31:11.782 --> 31:13.480
definitely does not
grow in the woods.

31:13.523 --> 31:15.917
Now, check out this photo
from the crime scene.

31:17.745 --> 31:19.399
How many flowers do you count?

31:21.618 --> 31:23.403
Eleven.

31:23.446 --> 31:24.491
I count 11.

31:24.534 --> 31:26.623
Yeah, 11 it is,

31:26.667 --> 31:28.887
which is definitely
one short of a bouquet,

31:28.930 --> 31:31.715
but why would Emma
take just one flower?

31:33.021 --> 31:36.851
Sam said that Emma liked to wear
a fresh peony over her ear.

31:36.895 --> 31:40.942
I-If Emma got the flowers
and took one...

31:40.986 --> 31:44.337
That means Emma was alive
after Sam left went to Florida.

31:44.380 --> 31:47.296
And he definitely
didn't kill his wife.

31:47.340 --> 31:49.124
Then who did?

32:05.401 --> 32:06.794
Oh. You can take it.

32:06.837 --> 32:08.143
No, no, you take it.

32:08.187 --> 32:10.319
The department stud
can't go hungry.

32:10.363 --> 32:11.799
Department stud?

32:11.842 --> 32:12.800
When has anyone
ever referred to me

32:12.843 --> 32:14.497
as the department stud?

32:14.541 --> 32:17.544
Oh, the host of a very
misleading podcast, that's who.

32:17.587 --> 32:20.503
Come on, really? The podcast--
you're still on that?

32:20.547 --> 32:22.375
Am I still on that?
I don't know. Maybe, maybe not.

32:22.418 --> 32:24.551
Because the podcast boy
has taken it upon himself

32:24.594 --> 32:27.336
to erase my contributions,
and what makes matters worse,

32:27.380 --> 32:28.990
he won't return my phone calls.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.905
So, yeah,
I think I'm still on that.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.038
- Oh, come on.
- Come on, what are you doing?

32:33.081 --> 32:35.954
I am just making this easy
on you guys.

32:37.564 --> 32:39.392
All right, guys.

32:39.435 --> 32:41.133
What do we know?

32:41.176 --> 32:43.526
Well, we know that
Sam sent Emma flowers

32:43.570 --> 32:45.833
after he landed in Florida.

32:45.876 --> 32:47.052
TORRES:And we know the cops
found the flowers

32:47.095 --> 32:49.532
on the Radners' porch.

32:49.576 --> 32:51.926
Which, according to
the original cops on the case,

32:51.970 --> 32:53.145
meant that the flowers
were delivered

32:53.188 --> 32:55.016
after Emma had
already been killed.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.713
But we also know that
Emma not only saw the flowers,

32:56.757 --> 32:58.585
but she took one of them.

32:58.628 --> 33:02.023
So, you got to think that
she brought that vase inside.

33:02.067 --> 33:03.938
But according to
the original police report,

33:03.982 --> 33:05.809
there were no prints
on the vase.

33:05.853 --> 33:07.333
Mc
All right, so someone kills her,

33:07.376 --> 33:09.335
wipes the vase clean,

33:09.378 --> 33:11.511
then plants the flowers
back on the porch to frame Sam?

33:14.775 --> 33:16.995
No evidence of
forced entry.

33:17.038 --> 33:18.518
Who else had access
to the house?

33:18.561 --> 33:19.823
We don't know.

33:21.608 --> 33:23.566
But we got the guy who would.

33:24.959 --> 33:28.136
So... that's it?

33:28.180 --> 33:30.704
I... I can go?

33:30.747 --> 33:31.966
Yes.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.489
As soon as we process you out.

33:33.533 --> 33:35.752
Thank you.

33:35.796 --> 33:37.624
For believing in me.

33:38.929 --> 33:41.236
Well, we believe
in the evidence,

33:41.280 --> 33:44.152
which proves that
you did not kill Emma.

33:44.196 --> 33:46.067
But then who did?

33:46.111 --> 33:47.460
We don't know.

33:47.503 --> 33:49.288
But, uh, we're hoping
you can help us.

33:49.331 --> 33:52.160
I mean, how? I don't...
I don't know anything.

33:52.204 --> 33:54.075
Who would have had
access to your house

33:54.119 --> 33:55.816
besides your
sister-in-law, Molly?

33:55.859 --> 33:58.079
Uh...

33:58.123 --> 34:01.691
There was our-our friend
Walt Freeman.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.432
Emma's old coworker.

34:03.476 --> 34:05.478
Why exactly did he have a key?

34:05.521 --> 34:07.784
Uh, he'd come over
and water our plants

34:07.828 --> 34:09.873
when we'd go on vacation.

34:09.917 --> 34:12.180
Uh, he'd do some handyman stuff.

34:12.224 --> 34:14.530
And what was Emma and Walt's
relationship like?

34:14.574 --> 34:16.271
Um, close.

34:16.315 --> 34:19.448
I mean, she was
his teaching assistant

34:19.492 --> 34:21.146
in her first job out of college.

34:21.189 --> 34:23.017
And then,

34:23.061 --> 34:26.673
he became her mentor and,
uh, eventually a father figure.

34:26.716 --> 34:29.023
Any chance, uh,

34:29.067 --> 34:31.591
Walt wanted something more?

34:31.634 --> 34:33.419
Walt?

34:33.462 --> 34:35.682
Are you kidding? No.

34:35.725 --> 34:37.292
They were just friends.

34:37.336 --> 34:40.252
Sometimes friendships
turn into infatuations.

34:40.295 --> 34:43.690
And infatuations
turn into obsessions.

34:47.868 --> 34:50.697
Walt Freeman taught psychology
for 25 years

34:50.740 --> 34:52.438
at a local junior college.

34:52.481 --> 34:53.874
McGEE:No glaring red flags
on the surface.

34:53.917 --> 34:56.485
But below the surface... Things get a little creepy.

34:56.529 --> 34:59.097
Walt had ten TAs
during his profession.

34:59.140 --> 35:01.403
Each one was a bright,
young woman.

35:01.447 --> 35:03.666
Walt had a reputation for, uh,

35:03.710 --> 35:05.668
having a fondness
for these woman.

35:05.712 --> 35:07.322
How much of a fondness?

35:07.366 --> 35:10.151
Well, no formal complaint
was ever filed,

35:10.195 --> 35:11.544
but I spoke to
two of the former TAs

35:11.587 --> 35:13.111
and they said that

35:13.154 --> 35:14.764
Walt was making
inappropriate compliments

35:14.808 --> 35:16.114
during their time together.

35:16.157 --> 35:17.854
He resigned five years ago.

35:17.898 --> 35:18.942
But we're thinking that
the school forced him

35:18.986 --> 35:20.814
into an early retirement.

35:20.857 --> 35:22.685
Let's go ask Mr. Freeman

35:22.729 --> 35:25.558
about his, uh, fondness
for Emma Radner.

35:25.601 --> 35:26.863
Before you go...

35:26.907 --> 35:28.474
I double-checked the vase

35:28.517 --> 35:29.910
from the police's
evidence department,

35:29.953 --> 35:31.433
and I found a print.

35:31.477 --> 35:32.826
I thought it was wiped clean.

35:32.869 --> 35:34.828
It was, on the outside.

35:34.871 --> 35:35.916
But I found

35:35.959 --> 35:36.917
a thumbprint

35:36.960 --> 35:38.310
on the inner rim.

35:38.353 --> 35:39.702
And when I ran it
through AFIS,

35:39.746 --> 35:42.096
I got a match.

35:46.274 --> 35:47.971
Hi, Molly. May we come in?

35:48.015 --> 35:49.930
Oh, yeah. Of course.

35:49.973 --> 35:51.497
Sorry to bother you.

35:51.540 --> 35:52.976
This, uh, shouldn't
take too long.

35:53.020 --> 35:54.804
It's okay, whatever you need.

35:54.848 --> 35:55.979
Is this about Sam?

35:56.023 --> 35:57.459
Sort of.

36:00.070 --> 36:03.335
We're just planning
Emma's, uh, service.

36:03.378 --> 36:06.686
It's overwhelming, but...
we're getting through it.

36:06.729 --> 36:08.949
WALT:Now that you got
justice for Emma,

36:08.992 --> 36:10.994
she deserves a proper burial.

36:11.038 --> 36:14.737
We don't have justice
quite yet, but we will.

36:14.781 --> 36:17.175
I thought you arrested Sam.

36:17.218 --> 36:18.524
No, we let Sam go.

36:18.567 --> 36:19.612
Let him go? Why?

36:19.655 --> 36:21.962
He didn't kill your sister.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.312
She did.

36:25.400 --> 36:28.534
Me? Wh...
No.

36:28.577 --> 36:30.188
You're making a mistake.
The only mistake

36:30.231 --> 36:31.972
was you forgetting to wipe down

36:32.015 --> 36:33.278
the inside of the vase

36:33.321 --> 36:35.018
before you put it
back on the porch.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.237
We found your thumbprint.

36:36.281 --> 36:37.369
Wait, wait.

36:37.412 --> 36:38.979
W-Why would I want to kill Emma?

36:39.022 --> 36:40.459
Well, we wondered
the same thing.

36:40.502 --> 36:42.200
Got a warrant
for your phone records.

36:42.243 --> 36:43.810
You were sending
your husband dozens

36:43.853 --> 36:45.377
of text messages
accusing him

36:45.420 --> 36:46.813
of having an affair with Emma.

36:46.856 --> 36:48.249
Nance Freeman,
you're under arrest

36:48.293 --> 36:49.816
for the murder of Emma Radner.
Nance?

36:49.859 --> 36:52.253
Nance? What did you do?

36:52.297 --> 36:53.515
It was an accident. No.

36:53.559 --> 36:54.821
Nance... I-I just wanted to
talk to her.

36:54.864 --> 36:55.952
She said I was being ridiculous,

36:55.996 --> 36:57.432
but I knew about them.

36:57.476 --> 36:59.652
I-I grabbed her
to make her listen to me.

36:59.695 --> 37:01.175
I'm so sorry. I never meant

37:01.219 --> 37:03.090
for any of this to happen!

37:07.529 --> 37:11.054
So, Nance really tried the whole
"it was an accident" excuse?

37:11.098 --> 37:14.580
Yep, and then she accidentally
dumped Emma's body

37:14.623 --> 37:16.582
in the woods and framed Sam
for the murder.

37:16.625 --> 37:19.106
All 'cause she thought Walt
and Emma were having an affair.

37:19.149 --> 37:20.586
Turns out they never were.

37:20.629 --> 37:23.284
Jealousy makes people do
some very strange things.

37:23.328 --> 37:25.634
Like, for example...

37:25.678 --> 37:28.246
Whoa. Is that a microphone?

37:28.289 --> 37:31.901
Yeah, that Curtis guy from
the-the basement hooked me up.

37:31.945 --> 37:34.817
And why exactly
do you need a microphone?

37:34.861 --> 37:37.342
Oh, Nick is starting
his own NCIS podcast.

37:37.385 --> 37:39.344
Only way to get the facts
out there.

37:39.387 --> 37:41.084
You seriously think

37:41.128 --> 37:42.695
Vance is gonna let you have
a revenge podcast?

37:42.738 --> 37:44.349
You're better than that.

37:44.392 --> 37:45.480
No, I'm not.

37:45.524 --> 37:47.090
No, he's-he's really not.

37:47.134 --> 37:48.831
Besides, it's not
about revenge.

37:48.875 --> 37:52.008
It's about telling our stories
to our fans.

37:52.052 --> 37:53.271
Right, well,
I-I'm not really sure

37:53.314 --> 37:55.316
that we have any fans, Nick.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.839
I mean, not yet,
because they haven't heard

37:56.883 --> 37:58.493
all the cool cases
we've worked on.

37:58.537 --> 38:00.408
Like, uh, the one
where the guy was selling drugs,

38:00.452 --> 38:02.280
uh, out of his ice cream truck?

38:02.323 --> 38:03.672
Wait, the Jenkins case?

38:03.716 --> 38:05.674
Seriously?

38:05.718 --> 38:09.939
Yeah, I found a stash of cocaine
inside a tub of, uh, rocky road.

38:09.983 --> 38:12.246
Yeah, only because I handed you
all of the evidence

38:12.290 --> 38:13.987
on a silver platter.

38:14.030 --> 38:15.336
I don't remember that.

38:15.380 --> 38:17.425
Okay, Nick, that was my case.

38:17.469 --> 38:20.341
That's why I got
a second microphone,

38:20.385 --> 38:22.343
because I'm gonna need
a cohost.

38:22.387 --> 38:24.954
Oh, no. No. No way.

38:24.998 --> 38:26.434
Come on, you love podcasts.

38:26.478 --> 38:28.175
Yeah, listening to them,
not making them.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.919
Welcome to our podcast, uh,

38:32.962 --> 38:34.094
forensic scientist

38:34.137 --> 38:35.704
Kasie Hines.

38:35.748 --> 38:36.705
Oh, my gosh, seriously, Nick.
I could never...

38:36.749 --> 38:38.838
Hey,

38:38.881 --> 38:42.885
all you true-crime fiends
out there in podcast land,

38:42.929 --> 38:44.670
let's talk murder.

38:44.713 --> 38:46.846
Ooh...

38:46.889 --> 38:48.978
Ooh.

38:51.764 --> 38:54.114
You know what
I miss the most about her

38:54.157 --> 38:57.291
was her laugh.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.293
She had a big laugh.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.774
Like a Julia Roberts
in <i>Pretty Woman</i> kind of laugh.

39:06.344 --> 39:09.521
I didn't realize
how unhappy she was.

39:12.741 --> 39:15.178
I'm so glad Emma got
the justice she deserved.

39:17.398 --> 39:18.356
Now that I'm not
fighting anymore,

39:18.399 --> 39:20.009
it's all just hitting me.

39:22.751 --> 39:25.450
You know, she's gone.

39:25.493 --> 39:27.495
And it hurts like hell.

39:30.193 --> 39:32.370
I know what you mean.

39:37.070 --> 39:41.204
I recently lost some friends.

39:41.248 --> 39:43.250
More like family, actually.

39:46.166 --> 39:47.602
How did you get through it?

39:48.647 --> 39:50.910
I'm not sure
you do get through it.

39:55.523 --> 39:56.916
But you keep going.

39:58.961 --> 40:01.399
And hopefully
you don't have to do it alone.

40:09.015 --> 40:12.192
- I'm-
- I'm so sorry, Sam.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.849
I don't ever expect you
to forgive me.

40:21.201 --> 40:22.507
I already have.

40:25.031 --> 40:28.600
Everything you said and did
was out of love for your sister.

40:30.515 --> 40:32.778
And that's something
we both have in common.

40:44.006 --> 40:44.964
Agent Knight?

40:47.096 --> 40:49.272
Thank you.

40:51.274 --> 40:53.451
You saved my life.
