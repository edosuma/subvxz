TO GO TO A REAL JEWELER.

04:02.310 --> 04:03.811
SHE'S WEARING GLASS!

04:03.844 --> 04:04.878
- IT'S NOT GLASS.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.481
IT'S GLASSETTE.

04:07.515 --> 04:08.982
- I GOT TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.078
- THANK YOU.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.553
- IT'S A TIE.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.291
SEE THE PATTERN?

13:44.324 --> 13:46.159
I PICKED IT OUT
JUST FOR YOU:

13:46.193 --> 13:49.930
LITTLE GUNS.

13:49.963 --> 13:54.935
- SMITH & WESSON 686
WITH A 2-POUND TRIGGER PULL.

13:54.968 --> 13:58.305
STANDARD POLICE ISSUE.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.240
I LOVE IT.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.915
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.083
ALL RIGHT, AND HERE--

14:10.117 --> 14:11.318
THAT'S FOR YOU.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.954
- OH, ROBERT!

14:13.987 --> 14:16.223
LOOK, DEBRA,
ROBERT GOT ME SOMETHING.

14:16.256 --> 14:17.590
- YEAH, GOOD FOR YOU.

14:17.624 --> 14:18.992
LISTEN, IF ANYBODY
NEEDS ME,

14:19.026 --> 14:22.329
I WILL BE IN THE DEN
PULLING UP CARPETING.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.563
- HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.266
- OH, MY.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.400
- SURPRISE!

14:27.434 --> 14:29.069
IT'S AN IGUANA.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.273
- YOU KNOW,
WITH AN IGUANA,

14:33.306 --> 14:37.144
YOU REALLY DON'T
HAVE TO SAY "SURPRISE."

14:37.177 --> 14:39.546
- WELL, DEBRA TOLD ME THAT
GREEN WAS YOUR FAVORITE COLOR.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.248
AND YOU KNOW, THE IGUANAS
ARE THE MOST LOYAL

14:41.281 --> 14:42.449
OF ALL THE REPTILES.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.084
AND, UH, CHECK HIM OUT,
SEE?

14:44.117 --> 14:45.352
- AH!

14:45.385 --> 14:46.586
- LOVELY, LOVELY GUY.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.956
HE'S VERY, VERY,
VERY DOCILE.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.924
- DID YOU FIND MY RING?

14:50.958 --> 14:53.626
OH, JUST A LIZARD.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.302
- HONEY.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.570
DEBRA.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.047
- RAY?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.486
- HI.

15:19.519 --> 15:20.553
THERE YOU GO.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.689
HAPPY--YOU KNOW.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.257
- [sobs]

15:24.291 --> 15:26.493
OH, THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL, RAY.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.528
- I CRIED TOO.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.666
ROSES ARE TWICE AS MUCH
ON VALENTINE'S DAY.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.237
- LISTEN, RAY.

15:37.270 --> 15:42.442
I HAVE, UH, SOMETHING TO
TELL YOU.

15:42.475 --> 15:46.113
WELL, I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE,
BUT I--

15:46.146 --> 15:47.714
I THINK I'VE LOST
MY ENGAGEMENT RING.

15:47.747 --> 15:51.151
[sobs]

15:51.184 --> 15:55.088
- AW, AW.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.356
AW, ALL RIGHT.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.724
ALL RIGHT, DON'T WORRY.

15:57.757 --> 16:00.027
I'M SURE IT'LL TURN UP,
HUH?

16:00.060 --> 16:03.763
DID YOU LOOK IN THE SOFA?

16:03.796 --> 16:06.199
- I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA FIND IT.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.101
OH, GOD, I KNEW THIS
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN ONE DAY.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.369
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
DON'T WORRY.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.138
- NO, LISTEN, RAY.

16:14.341 --> 16:18.245
I HAVE A CONFESSION
TO MAKE TO YOU.

16:18.278 --> 16:22.215
RIGHT AFTER
WE GOT ENGAGED,

16:22.249 --> 16:25.385
I HAD THE ORIGINAL STONE
REPLACED.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.333
- WHAT?

16:43.803 --> 16:45.705
- HONEY, WHEN YOU ASKED ME
TO MARRY YOU,

16:45.738 --> 16:48.041
I WAS SO HAPPY,
BELIEVE ME.

16:48.075 --> 16:51.178
BUT THAT DIAMOND,

16:51.211 --> 16:54.247
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I--

16:54.281 --> 16:56.416
I KNEW YOU GOT THE BEST STONE
YOU COULD AFFORD,

16:56.449 --> 16:57.617
BLESS YOUR HEART.

16:57.650 --> 17:01.154
BUT, WELL, LIKE,
YOU KNOW, MY PARENTS

17:01.188 --> 17:03.423
WEREN'T THAT CRAZY ABOUT YOU
TO BEGIN WITH,

17:03.456 --> 17:07.227
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO SHOW 'EM THAT STONE.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.631
- I UNDERSTAND.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.139
- YOU KNOW
MY GRANDMOTHER ABBY?

17:19.172 --> 17:20.573
SHE'D GIVEN ME HER RING
YEARS BEFORE,

17:20.607 --> 17:24.344
SO I PUT THAT STONE
IN YOUR SETTING AND--

17:24.377 --> 17:26.079
[sobs]

17:26.113 --> 17:28.315
- DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW MUCH IT WAS WORTH?

17:28.348 --> 17:31.851
JUST BALLPARK?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.853
- OH, SWEETIE,
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

17:33.886 --> 17:38.391
- HOW IMPORTANT IS IT NOT?

17:38.425 --> 17:39.826
- WHAT?

17:39.859 --> 17:43.330
- HOW MUCH WAS
OLD ABBY'S STONE WORTH?

17:43.363 --> 17:45.532
- $15,000.

18:00.880 --> 18:04.851
I COULD JUST KILL MYSELF,
RAY!

18:04.884 --> 18:07.520
- THIS COULD BE
A MURDER-SUICIDE.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.657
- I GOT TO KEEP
LOOKING FOR IT.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.559
- YEAH, YOU--
NO, NO, NO.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.460
NO, NO, NO,
STOP LOOKING.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.861
STOP LOOKING.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.729
LISTEN, WE HAVE TO BE
REALISTIC, OKAY?

18:16.763 --> 18:18.165
THE RING IS GONE.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.700
IT'S GONE.

18:20.733 --> 18:23.370
ALL RIGHT? LISTEN.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.472
ALL RIGHT, YOU MADE
A MISTAKE, THAT'S ALL.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.474
EVERYBODY MAKES A MISTAKE.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.742
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE LUCKY.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.311
'CAUSE--'CAUSE
YOU'RE MARRIED TO A GUY

18:31.344 --> 18:33.146
WHO DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT THOSE THINGS.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.482
- OH!
- DON'T LIFT THAT CUSHION!

18:35.515 --> 18:39.118
STOP TORTURING YOURSELF!

18:40.820 --> 18:42.355
IT'S GONE, THAT'S ALL.

18:42.389 --> 18:45.325
LOOK.

18:45.358 --> 18:48.361
YOU KNOW WHAT
WE BOTH COULD USE RIGHT NOW?

18:48.395 --> 18:49.796
PIE.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.567
LET'S HAVE A LITTLE
PIE WITH--

18:54.601 --> 18:55.868
- OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:55.902 --> 18:59.606
I GOT TO STOP
THINKING ABOUT THIS.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.274
- OKAY. YOU KNOW,
MAYBE IT'S IN THE--

19:01.308 --> 19:02.775
OH, MY GOD!
YOU FOUND IT!

19:02.809 --> 19:03.910
OH, MY GOD!

19:03.943 --> 19:05.178
GIVE IT TO ME!
GIVE IT TO ME!

19:05.212 --> 19:07.447
GIVE IT TO ME!
OH, GOD, OH!

19:07.480 --> 19:09.649
OH!
OH, RAY!

19:09.682 --> 19:10.650
- YEAH.

19:10.683 --> 19:11.651
- [laughing]
- YEAH.

19:11.684 --> 19:15.922
OH, WHAT A HAPPY MOMENT NOW.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.824
- OH, SWEETIE,
OH, COME HERE.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.392
COME HERE!
OH, LISTEN--

19:19.426 --> 19:21.494
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU
FIRST GAVE ME THIS RING,

19:21.528 --> 19:23.830
I JUST KNEW WE WERE
GOING TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.298
- KEEP THAT IN MIND.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.567
- HERE.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.836
YOU PUT IT ON ME, OKAY?

19:29.869 --> 19:31.638
GO ON, PUT IT ON ME.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.874
OH, MY GOD!

19:34.907 --> 19:36.175
- THERE YOU GO.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.861
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

20:01.468 --> 20:04.003
- I, UH,

20:04.036 --> 20:05.438
MEANT WELL.

20:08.975 --> 20:11.010
- YOU CHANGED THE STONE
IN MY RING.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.813
WHERE IS
MY GRANDMOTHER'S DIAMOND?

20:15.348 --> 20:17.384
- JUST LIKE GRANDMA.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.287
GONE.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.688
- YOU THREW IT OUT?

20:21.721 --> 20:24.524
- I-I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT IT WAS A $15,000 DIAMOND.

20:24.557 --> 20:28.428
I THOUGHT IT WAS
JUST A PIECE OF JUNK.

20:28.461 --> 20:31.664
- SO YOU KNEW THAT
THE FIRST RING YOU BOUGHT ME

20:31.698 --> 20:33.333
WAS A PIECE OF JUNK?

20:33.366 --> 20:37.370
- I WAS TRYING TO GET YOU
MORE FOR YOUR MONEY, THAT'S ALL.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.671
THIS IS YOUR FAULT ANYWAY!

20:38.705 --> 20:39.672
- MY FAULT?

20:39.706 --> 20:41.274
- THAT'S RIGHT!

20:41.308 --> 20:42.775
IF YOU HAD JUST BEEN
HONEST ENOUGH TO TELL ME

20:42.809 --> 20:44.377
THAT YOU'D CHANGED IT,

20:44.411 --> 20:46.679
THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD
TO STEAL IT FROM YOU.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.281
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU'RE A GREAT THIEF, RAY.

20:48.315 --> 20:50.917
YOU JUST THREW OUT $15,000.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.320
WHO'D YOU GET
THIS STONE FROM, LEON?

20:54.887 --> 20:56.556
- HOW--

20:56.589 --> 20:59.492
DARE YOU!

20:59.526 --> 21:00.860
HUH?

21:00.893 --> 21:02.429
- HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

21:02.462 --> 21:04.297
- 'CAUSE I WAS TRYING
TO FIX THE WHOLE THING!

21:04.331 --> 21:06.433
- WHY, AFTER EIGHT YEARS,
DO YOU TRY TO FIX IT NOW?

21:06.466 --> 21:09.336
- BECAUSE I LOVE YOU, HUH?

21:09.369 --> 21:11.404
WHY DID YOU CHANGE IT
EIGHT YEARS AGO?

21:11.438 --> 21:13.406
- BECAUSE I LOVE YOU!

21:13.440 --> 21:15.775
- MOMMY, DADDY.

21:15.808 --> 21:16.976
- HONEY,
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

21:17.009 --> 21:18.911
GETTING READY FOR BED NOW,
SWEETIE.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.914
- LOOK WHAT I FOUND
IN MY BACKPACK.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.316
- WHAT IS IT?

21:23.350 --> 21:27.454
- A VALENTINE.

21:27.487 --> 21:28.821
KENNY GAVE IT TO ME.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.923
- OH.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.326
THAT'S REALLY SWEET, HONEY.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.728
- IT'S STUCK WITH GUM.

21:35.762 --> 21:39.532
- KENNY BLEW A BIG BUBBLE
AND PUT IT IN THERE FOR ME.

21:39.566 --> 21:42.034
both: AH.

21:42.068 --> 21:44.504
- HE MUST REALLY LIKE ME.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.606
- YEAH, THAT'S SWEET.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.107
LISTEN, WHY DON'T YOU GO UP
AND GET READY FOR BED,

21:48.140 --> 21:49.942
AND WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE,
OKAY?

21:56.148 --> 21:59.652
HA, WOW.

21:59.686 --> 22:01.053
LOOK AT THAT.

22:01.087 --> 22:03.690
A WAD OF GUM
ON A PIECE OF PAPER.

22:03.723 --> 22:06.025
- YEAH.

22:06.058 --> 22:07.660
CHEAP BASTARD.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.575
[clattering]

22:22.609 --> 22:24.477
[cat yowls]

22:24.511 --> 22:30.082
[clanking,
clattering continues]

22:30.116 --> 22:33.820
OH, MAN.
CAN WE TAKE A BREAK?

22:33.853 --> 22:35.888
MY EYES ARE BURNIN'.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.957
- NOT UNTIL
WE FIND THE DIAMOND.

22:37.990 --> 22:41.661
- [groans]

22:41.694 --> 22:44.397
HERE'S A RING...
FINGER.
