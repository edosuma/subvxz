00:03.040 --> 00:06.000
Shames me to say I was never very close to the boy.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.200
I all but abandoned him.

00:08.200 --> 00:10.200
You do have a way with him.

00:10.200 --> 00:14.400
I'm not sure I have.
There's nothing more natural than a mother's love.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.200
You're a fascinating woman, Elizabeth.

00:19.100 --> 00:21.900
Please don't presume to know me.

00:21.900 --> 00:23.900
You like him, don't you?

00:23.900 --> 00:27.100
That's neither here nor there, since our acquaintance is at an end.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Regina is using James's secret as a weapon 
to ensure her continued presence at Ash Park!

00:37.000 --> 00:38.700
I will return to the farmhouse.

00:38.700 --> 00:43.000
Give me the dirt on those... boozy openings of yours.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.400
And if I refuse?

00:44.400 --> 00:46.100
Our arrangement is terminated.

00:46.100 --> 00:49.300
Which will make a certain member of your family very happy.

00:49.300 --> 00:50.700
Regina.

Beware the friendless female.  By Carolyn Bligh.

Aah, you're making up for lost time, aren't you?

01:56.100 --> 01:59.300
No, let me, let me, eh!
It was a joke!

01:59.300 --> 02:02.300
No, I shouldn't have come.  I don't know what I was thinking.

02:02.300 --> 02:03.700
Oh, yes, you do.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.700
Where did you say you were going?

02:05.700 --> 02:08.199
Out for a ride.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.199
Well then, Mrs. Bligh...

02:12.800 --> 02:13.800
Ride me.

02:13.800 --> 02:18.300
Ha ha ha!
You really are too much!

02:18.300 --> 02:22.100
You...
are too delicious for words.

02:37.700 --> 02:39.200
What're you doing?

02:53.800 --> 02:57.000
If the farmers are going to be able to stay on the land...

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
If we want the farmers to stay on the land, they need our support.

03:11.100 --> 03:16.800
The farmers need someone who's willing to fight for them.
Who's willing to fight for them...

03:36.800 --> 03:38.300
Sarah?

03:40.600 --> 03:41.600
Are you all right?

03:43.800 --> 03:46.900
What's wrong?
It's just a cramp.  It's nothing.  I'm fine.

03:48.700 --> 03:49.900
I'll drive you to work.

03:57.700 --> 04:00.300
You're up early.  How was the ride?

04:00.300 --> 04:02.300
Fine.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.500
Did you sleep well, darling?

04:12.500 --> 04:17.100
I was up all night thinking about father's meeting today.

04:17.100 --> 04:19.700
Who's his meeting with?

04:19.700 --> 04:24.500
He's going up to the city to meet with 
the press office of the Country Party.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.500
Blackjack McCuen arranged it.

04:26.500 --> 04:31.500
It's all about to kick off.
Newspapers... Radio...

04:31.500 --> 04:34.700
I am not sure I'm ready.
All that attention.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.800
Darling... you'll be fine.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.200
With you and me by father's side 
we'll be an unbeatable team.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.700
I do love you.  You know that, don't you?

04:57.400 --> 05:00.400
Thank you for the lift, but I'll be fine.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.400
Of course.

05:10.900 --> 05:12.200
Mrs. Nordmann.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.200
Oh!

05:14.200 --> 05:17.200
Such a brisk morning!

05:19.900 --> 05:22.100
Dr. Duncan!  A hand.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.600
Doris, I'll take it from here.

05:41.600 --> 05:45.700
Come on!
[ITALIAN SWEARING]

05:48.100 --> 05:48.900
Gino!

05:48.900 --> 05:52.900
Please just stop it, this is crazy.
I can fix it.

05:54.100 --> 05:59.400
My family have three perfectly good tractors.
I know they'd be more than happy to let you borrow one.

05:59.400 --> 06:03.100
Please, cara.  It's my own business, I'll sort it out.

06:03.100 --> 06:06.000
Why are you being so pig-headed?

06:09.600 --> 06:10.800
Gino?

06:10.800 --> 06:15.000
Don't walk away from me!
I'm going into town to pick up parts.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.400
And now you're throwing away good money, instead of
swallowing your pride and asking my family for help.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.200
The vines need watering.  I need you to get started on them before it gets too hot.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.200
You said I could work on my novel today!

06:27.600 --> 06:29.400
Is your novel gonna put food on the table?

06:29.400 --> 06:31.900
Keep a roof over our heads?

06:31.900 --> 06:35.400
Well... It could... if I ever had a chance to actually work on it!

06:37.000 --> 06:37.800
Anna...

06:39.600 --> 06:41.300
This vineyard is our future.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.800
That's your dream, Gino.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.800
And I support you on it.

06:45.800 --> 06:48.800
But when do I get to have mine?

06:59.900 --> 07:02.200
So no cramps or spotting before this morning?

07:04.600 --> 07:07.900
No.  I was a fool to think my body could carry a baby to full term.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.900
It's not over yet.

07:13.400 --> 07:17.500
I'll get you a single room for some privacy.
You're on strict bed rest.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.000
And if the cramping doesn't stop?

07:23.000 --> 07:28.100
We'll try an alcohol drip.  
Slow the contractions, hopefully stop them altogether.

07:29.800 --> 07:30.800
Thank you.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.400
You know the upside to all this?

07:33.400 --> 07:37.200
That alcohol drip's gonna leave you completely legless.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.900
Is there anything else I can get you?

07:44.400 --> 07:45.400
Renee.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.500
I'd like him to be here, whatever happens.

07:58.200 --> 08:02.200
Is Mrs. Nordmann all right?
Yes, uhh....  She only wants to see her husband right now.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.500
Doris...

08:06.500 --> 08:07.800
Yes, Dr. Duncan?

08:07.800 --> 08:10.100
Could you do me a big favour?
Hmm?

08:10.100 --> 08:13.500
...and go to Roy's and ask him to bring Dr. Nordmann to the hospital?

08:14.200 --> 08:18.100
Well, of course.
I shall go there at once on my trusty steed.

08:18.100 --> 08:21.200
Is there anything else you'd like me to tell Dr. Nordmann?
I'll go.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.600
It'll be faster.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.200
Uh, no offence, George, but I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

08:25.300 --> 08:27.200
Please.  I insist.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.400
Mrs. Standish.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.600
Mrs. Standish, I brought your laundry down from the house.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.800
Mrs. Standish, what's happened?

08:56.100 --> 08:58.700
Your hand!

09:02.800 --> 09:05.000
You should really see a doctor, ma'am.

09:06.100 --> 09:08.300
If you go now, you could catch Mr. Bligh.

09:08.300 --> 09:09.900
What're you talking about?

09:09.900 --> 09:11.900
He telephoned.  From the hospital.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.900
He's cancelled all his meetings in the cuty.

09:13.900 --> 09:15.500
Has he taken ill?

09:15.500 --> 09:16.900
No, no.  He's right as rain.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.200
Is it the baby?

09:19.200 --> 09:21.600
Oh, no.  Georgie's well over his cold.

09:21.600 --> 09:25.000
He's been chattering away all morning, blowing razzberries....
Oh, shut up.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.200
George wouldn't miss...

09:28.200 --> 09:32.000
A meeting about his political career over a trifle.

09:32.900 --> 09:34.300
It's too important to him.

09:38.800 --> 09:42.300
Did he happen to mention a Mrs. Nordmann, by any chance?

09:42.300 --> 09:44.700
Yes.  He said something...

09:44.700 --> 09:46.700
maybe that she's taken ill?

09:47.800 --> 09:49.500
Let's hope it's fatal.

09:50.100 --> 09:52.200
Whatever it is.
Haha!

09:52.200 --> 09:54.800
You do say such funny things, ma'am.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.500
Of course I'm disappointed.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.000
I had a little surprise planned for you.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
But I suppose it can wait.

10:06.500 --> 10:07.700
I miss you.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.700
Bye.

10:09.700 --> 10:12.200
Umm...

10:12.200 --> 10:14.600
Jack's not coming back tonight.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.600
Some emergency at the hospital.

10:16.600 --> 10:21.500
I don't know why you don't just marry the man, 
instead of carrying on like a pair of lovesick adolescents.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.900
That's exactly why I won't marry him.

10:23.900 --> 10:25.900
Keeps it far more exciting.

10:25.900 --> 10:28.000
I'd so miss your disapproving looks.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
So...

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
what have you planned for your day?

10:32.800 --> 10:36.300
Will you be going to see Mr. Goddard at the refuge?
[AHEM] No.

10:37.300 --> 10:40.100
Then  you can come to an exhibition opening with me.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.200
They're unveiling a mural down at the Rocks.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.700
Sounds ghastly.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.200
I've invited Sir Richard.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.400
Oh, Carolyn, you didn't!
[KNOCKING]

10:49.400 --> 10:51.400
Oh, that will be my lift.  Simon.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.400
Would you go?  I need to get my camera.

10:58.300 --> 10:59.600
Hi.  You must be Caro's mum.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.800
I'm Simon.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.800
Simon Hallow, the actor.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.600
Carolyn will be with you presently.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.800
Carolyn, you cannot invite a man like Sir Richard to one of your avant-garde soirees.

11:12.800 --> 11:13.800
Oh, mother, really.

11:13.800 --> 11:18.400
And despite his overt vulgarity, your brother 
is relying on him to support his campaign.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.100
I would say he's brash, rather than vulgar.

11:21.100 --> 11:24.000
And I think a trip to the Rocks is exactly what he needs.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.600
Where's Simon?

11:25.700 --> 11:26.600
Oh, he's...

11:27.400 --> 11:28.600
Mother!

11:29.300 --> 11:30.300
Oh!

11:30.300 --> 11:33.000
Simon!  Darling!

11:33.000 --> 11:35.900
[MWAH}
Ignore my mother's rudeness.

11:35.900 --> 11:38.200
Last chance!
No, dear.

11:48.000 --> 11:48.900
Renee!

12:10.400 --> 12:11.900
How far along is she?

12:11.900 --> 12:14.200
Must be at least four months.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.000
I didn't think the frog would have it in him!
Hehe!

12:17.000 --> 12:19.200
We recon she might lose it, though.

12:19.200 --> 12:22.300
Julie Carmon!  Where is your respect for privacy?

12:22.300 --> 12:24.500
Talking out of school about one of your own!

12:24.500 --> 12:26.300
You have no idea what...

12:26.300 --> 12:30.600
Mrs. Nordmann may be going through.  None at all!

12:49.500 --> 12:52.500
In France they used to use a drug.  A hormone synthetique.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.600
In my opinion, those drugs can do more harm than good.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.600
The alcohol method.  You get good results?

13:19.100 --> 13:20.400
Sarah.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.200
Is the baby mine?

13:25.500 --> 13:27.300
Please.  I need to know.

13:32.800 --> 13:33.800
Yes.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.800
Does Renee know?

13:41.800 --> 13:43.300
Yes.

13:44.900 --> 13:47.900
But we decided to raise it as our own.

13:49.900 --> 13:51.400
Uh...

13:54.500 --> 13:56.400
were you...

13:57.100 --> 13:58.700
ever going to tell me?

14:02.800 --> 14:03.900
No.

14:06.100 --> 14:08.700
Why would you ever keep something like this from me?

14:10.400 --> 14:11.500
Our baby.

14:13.900 --> 14:16.200
It doesn't matter now, anyway.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.900
Uh, George.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.900

14:37.200 --> 14:38.800
Mr. Goddard, I...

14:38.800 --> 14:41.700
I'm afraid you've wasted your time coming here.

14:41.700 --> 14:44.200
Your children may find you formidable...

14:44.200 --> 14:46.200
but you don't scare me.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.200
Not one bit.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.200
Well, then...

14:50.200 --> 14:52.200
please keep it brief.

14:52.200 --> 14:55.400
I'm too old for these games, Elizabeth.

14:55.400 --> 14:58.900
I'm sorry if I offended you yesterday.

14:58.900 --> 15:00.900
But, uh...

15:02.200 --> 15:03.600
I like you.

15:04.600 --> 15:09.600
I don't meet many people I can genuinely say that about, 
but I can say that about you.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.000
And I'm not the only one.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.700
All the men've been asking after you.

15:15.700 --> 15:18.100
Now you're telling tales.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.800
Been wondering when you're coming back to play the piano.

15:20.800 --> 15:26.100
Sure there are plenty of pianists in Sidney
who can entertain the men equally well.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.100
But they're not you.

15:38.200 --> 15:42.600
Please tell the men I'm sorry to disappoint them, 
but I've decided to return home.

15:42.600 --> 15:47.300
My son George is entering the political arena, 
and I'd like to be there to offer my support.

15:49.300 --> 15:50.300
Oh.

15:51.100 --> 15:52.700
Really.

15:54.600 --> 15:58.600
I thought you said you were finished
with interfering with your children's lives.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.700
Well unlike you, Mr. Goddard, I'm not the type to abandon their child.

16:05.300 --> 16:06.600
You're right.

16:06.600 --> 16:10.100
I shouldn't've wasten my time coming here.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.400
Just for the record...

16:14.600 --> 16:17.700
there isn't a day when I don't miss my son.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.200
Not one day.

16:34.200 --> 16:38.100
A mural on a public street could hardly be called high art.

16:38.100 --> 16:42.100
If it were up to me, I'd have the whole thing whitewashed.  
Waste of public funds.

16:42.100 --> 16:42.800
But...

16:42.800 --> 16:47.100
Write something good, and I'll include it in the weekend arts review.

16:47.100 --> 16:50.300
I have to say, I was shocked 
when you printed my last piece.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.400
Especially as I didn't write 
a single word you asked me to.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.400
You surprised me.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.500
I like a woman who surprises me.

16:59.500 --> 17:02.100
So you going back to Ash park, or you staying in town?

17:02.100 --> 17:04.099
I'm in the city.
I have an apartment here.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.300
How convenient.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
As you're in town, you should come and have dinner with me.
Tomorrow night?

17:10.000 --> 17:13.200
I'm sorry.  I have plans.

You're not taking him from me again.

39:14.900 --> 39:16.500
He's my son!

39:16.900 --> 39:18.000
I'll tell them.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
I'll tell them the truth!

39:20.900 --> 39:22.000
What...

39:25.200 --> 39:26.900
what is it that...

39:26.900 --> 39:29.500
makes oyu think he's yours?

39:29.500 --> 39:31.500
I know my own son.

39:32.400 --> 39:33.700
I knew.

39:33.700 --> 39:36.200
As soon as I saw him at Ash Park.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.200
I knew I'd found him.

39:38.200 --> 39:42.400
But you know that can't possibly be true.
Georgie is my little boy.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.300
Stpo lying!
I'm not lying.

39:44.300 --> 39:47.800
I gave birth to him on the 21st of January at a private clinic in S...

39:47.800 --> 39:49.800
You never gave birth to him!

39:50.500 --> 39:52.000
It was me!

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Screaming in that room.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.600
Tied to that bed, all alone.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.200
He's my son.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.000
And I can prove it.

40:48.500 --> 40:49.900
Oh, Rose...

40:51.600 --> 40:53.400
what happened?

40:57.300 --> 40:59.600
What happened during the birth?

41:02.000 --> 41:05.400
Do you even remember it?
Of course I remember.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.900
I remember everything.

41:09.000 --> 41:13.300
Even though they covered my face up with a sheet...
so I couldn't see.

41:14.900 --> 41:15.900
I knew...

41:16.600 --> 41:18.500
what was going on.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.500
They told me this was...

41:22.500 --> 41:25.300
punishment for my sins.

41:27.300 --> 41:29.200
They kept on and on at me.

41:29.700 --> 41:32.200
Called me a stupid girl.

41:33.100 --> 41:38.800
'And final push, you stupid, stupid girl'. 
They kept on and on at me.

41:38.800 --> 41:42.200
Push!
And I was trying!

41:42.200 --> 41:45.200
I was trying to push! And then....

41:48.700 --> 41:50.800
And then it all went quiet.

41:57.500 --> 41:59.400
He didn't cry, did he?

42:03.400 --> 42:05.400
He didn't cry!

42:10.300 --> 42:14.200
And he was... so still.

42:14.200 --> 42:19.700
And... and so sad and... blue.

42:21.800 --> 42:22.800
I know.

42:34.800 --> 42:35.800
Oh, God.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.700
What have I done?

42:54.500 --> 42:57.300
No one should ever have to go through what you did.

43:01.200 --> 43:02.900
Especially not alone.

43:16.800 --> 43:20.000
What do you think happens to babies after they die?

43:20.000 --> 43:22.900
Do you think my baby's trapped in Limbo?

43:22.900 --> 43:24.900
No.

43:24.900 --> 43:28.500
I don't believe God could be that cruel.

43:30.100 --> 43:32.300
Will they go to Heaven, do you think?

43:33.300 --> 43:34.300
Yes.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.100
I'm sure.

43:39.300 --> 43:42.900
Are you gonna hand me over to the police... for taking him?

43:42.900 --> 43:44.900
No.

43:44.900 --> 43:46.900
No, I'm not.

43:51.400 --> 43:52.700
Let's go home.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
Shh.

44:18.400 --> 44:19.500
[BABY FUSSES]

44:23.400 --> 44:25.900
Shh.  Shh.

44:43.400 --> 44:45.400
I can't really at the moment.

44:45.400 --> 44:46.600
I will.

44:46.600 --> 44:48.200
You, too.

44:48.200 --> 44:50.200
All right, then, I...

44:50.200 --> 44:53.000
Yes, yes.  We'll talk soon.
Thank you, Carolyn.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.700
Carolyn hasn't heard from him.

44:59.300 --> 45:01.900
But I'm sure James will be back.

45:01.900 --> 45:04.800
[SOBS]
I'm sorry.

45:04.800 --> 45:09.100
I shouldn't be crying in front of you.
Nonsense.  Nonsense.

45:10.700 --> 45:12.100
George...

45:15.500 --> 45:19.100
You don't think he's gone off and done something?
No.

45:22.500 --> 45:24.400
He's angry, that's all.

45:24.400 --> 45:26.400
You had an argument.

45:27.800 --> 45:29.200
Unless there's...

45:29.200 --> 45:31.600
there's something you're not telling me.

45:34.800 --> 45:35.800
No.

45:37.400 --> 45:38.900
No, there's nothing.

45:40.400 --> 45:42.800
Eight hours without cramps.

45:42.800 --> 45:44.800
Blood pressure's good.

45:44.800 --> 45:46.800
I think you're out of the woods.

45:48.400 --> 45:51.800
Now I think you're, uh, 
gonna have a little fighter on your hands.

45:51.800 --> 45:55.000
Well, it's determined to be here, 
that's for sure.

45:55.000 --> 46:00.500
Next two weeks you're on a strict bed rest regime.
You're not to attempt to do any work....

46:00.500 --> 46:04.500
or oide your bike.  Just... rest.
You have my word.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Time you got some rest, too.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
You have to look after yourself.  
Especially now you're going to be a father.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.300
Uh... Roy is waiting outside.  We should go.

46:15.300 --> 46:18.400
Oh!  I'm so glad I caught you both.

46:18.400 --> 46:20.200
These are for you.

46:20.200 --> 46:23.700
And this is a tonic I give all my mothers-to-be.

46:23.700 --> 46:25.700
It's, uh, to keep your Iron levels up.

46:25.700 --> 46:27.500
That's very kind, Doris.

46:27.500 --> 46:30.300
Look, I hope I'm not speaking out of school, but...

46:30.300 --> 46:34.800
I just want you to know how glad I am 
that you and Dr. Nordmann are going to have a family.

46:34.800 --> 46:38.400
It never happened for Mr. Collins and myself.
We went through many heartaches.

46:38.400 --> 46:40.800
So I do understand a little 
of what you've just been through.

46:40.800 --> 46:44.300
And rest assured, 
I shall be the soul of discretion.

46:45.200 --> 46:49.100
Until you're ready
to tell the world your joyous news.

46:49.100 --> 46:51.100
Thank you.

47:30.100 --> 47:33.000
It's Reg's funeral on Friday.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.400
Just gonna be me and a few of the men.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.100
I wasn't able to locate the daughter.

47:39.100 --> 47:43.200
Well, surely we can...
rustle up a few more?

47:43.200 --> 47:45.600
Give the man a decent send-off.

47:45.600 --> 47:48.300
He served his country, after all.

47:48.300 --> 47:50.300
Paid the price.

47:52.000 --> 47:52.800
Uh...

47:53.500 --> 47:55.300
would you mind...

47:55.300 --> 47:57.100
I'd like to be there.

47:57.100 --> 47:59.100
Well, that'd be wonderful.

48:02.400 --> 48:04.000
Reg would've liked you.

48:05.700 --> 48:08.400
A man of... great discernment, was he?

48:08.400 --> 48:09.900
Absolutely.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
Yeaghh!

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Now slow down, there!

48:26.000 --> 48:28.400
Precious cargo on board.

48:28.400 --> 48:31.000
Ha!  There we go.
Thanks, Roy.

48:34.400 --> 48:36.200
Hello, Hankski.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.300
Sarah, you need to go and rest.

48:55.300 --> 48:57.300
Who's for a cup of tea, then?

48:57.300 --> 48:59.300
Get that kettle on, eh?

48:59.300 --> 49:01.300
That'd be lovely, Roy.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.700
George!
I wasn't expecting you.

49:25.700 --> 49:27.700
Is James here?
No.

49:27.700 --> 49:30.800
What's happened?
Do you have any Idea where he may have gone?

49:32.700 --> 49:34.400
I need to know if you've...

49:34.400 --> 49:37.200
said something that may have driven him away.

49:37.200 --> 49:38.600
Of course not.

49:38.600 --> 49:42.400
I said I would never say anything to hurt the poor boy.

49:42.400 --> 49:46.000
I know after everything Carolyn said you won't believe me.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
But I truly care about James.

49:49.900 --> 49:51.600
And you.

49:53.900 --> 49:56.200
If he contacts you, let me know.

49:56.200 --> 49:59.200
I need to know my son's safe.
Of course.

49:59.200 --> 50:01.900
Aill start making inquiries.

50:01.900 --> 50:04.400
We will find him, George.

50:42.400 --> 50:43.800
James.

50:44.300 --> 50:46.200
You said if I ever needed a friend.

50:47.600 --> 50:48.900
Of course.  Come in.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.300
She's sleeping.

50:57.300 --> 50:58.600
That's good.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.600
There's a cup of tea there for ya.

51:03.400 --> 51:06.500
We had a coulpe of those scones too, before I polished'em all off.

51:07.800 --> 51:09.400
I better go and do some work.

51:10.400 --> 51:13.500
You better have a rest, mate.
You're looking a bit ragged round the edge yourself.

51:23.500 --> 51:26.000
I have every right to be here!

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
George!

51:59.900 --> 52:01.000
Renee.

52:06.300 --> 52:07.800
Why are you here?

52:09.000 --> 52:10.800
I told you to stay away!

52:11.200 --> 52:13.200
Please, let's sit down and talk.

52:14.500 --> 52:16.200
Will you stay away from us!

52:16.700 --> 52:18.200
From my wife!

52:19.000 --> 52:21.700
Renee!
Calm down, please!

52:22.100 --> 52:23.900
Stop talking!

52:23.900 --> 52:27.900
Stop...
AAHHH!!  UGHH!!

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
