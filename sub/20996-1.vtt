02:29.400 --> 02:31.231
What the hell is this?

02:31.800 --> 02:32.994
I don't know.

02:33.720 --> 02:34.720
Whoa.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.113
Bloody hell.

02:43.160 --> 02:46.550
The Crossrail is the biggest
construction project in Europe,

02:46.680 --> 02:49.513
carving 26 miles of new
commuter train tunnels

02:49.600 --> 02:50.953
beneath the surface
of London.

02:51.080 --> 02:55.392
But today, an ancient tomb filled with
the coffins of Crusader knights...

02:55.520 --> 02:56.616
People don't realize

02:56.640 --> 02:58.631
that London is
a giant graveyard.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.553
A modern city built
on centuries of death.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.576
Because of the
tomb's proximity to the Thames,

03:03.600 --> 03:04.896
half the space is flooded,
is that right?

03:04.920 --> 03:07.256
There are even more
coffins submerged underwater.

03:07.280 --> 03:09.720
The tomb appears to have been
built during the Second Crusade,

03:09.840 --> 03:12.035
which means it's filled
with the bodies

03:12.280 --> 03:13.616
of Crusader knights
who invaded Egypt

03:13.640 --> 03:14.868
before returning to England.

03:14.960 --> 03:17.076
It has also
revealed a treasure trove

03:17.200 --> 03:19.316
of secrets about
London's history.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.591
Clear them out, please.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.391
Ladies and gentlemen,
please stop what you're doing.

03:37.480 --> 03:40.313
The train tunnel has been
rerouted north of here.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.428
We are now taking
control of this site.

03:45.920 --> 03:49.549
Please collect your tools and
gear and exit immediately.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.195
Oi!

03:51.280 --> 03:53.396
Excuse me.
Excuse me!

03:53.480 --> 03:56.119
This is my site.
What do you think you're doing?

03:56.200 --> 03:58.031
Evacuate your men.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.997
We'll take it
from here.

04:01.080 --> 04:03.196
Who the hell are you people?

04:03.680 --> 04:05.875
This way, sir.
Thank you very much.

04:08.640 --> 04:12.758
The past cannot
remain buried forever.

04:15.480 --> 04:20.507
In my lifetime, I have unearthed
many ancient mysteries.

04:22.160 --> 04:28.156
At last, this tomb reveals
antiquity's darkest secret.

04:30.400 --> 04:36.191
A secret erased from history
and forgotten to time.

04:38.520 --> 04:39.589
Princess Ahmanet.

04:41.760 --> 04:43.398
Beautiful,

04:44.360 --> 04:45.554
cunning,

04:47.040 --> 04:48.632
and ruthless.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.874
Sole heir to
the throne of Egypt.

04:54.240 --> 04:57.391
The pharaoh's kingdom
would one day be hers to rule

04:58.880 --> 05:00.916
without mercy or fear.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.754
And Ahmanet would be
worshipped as a living god.

05:23.760 --> 05:26.558
But Pharaoh had a son.

05:27.960 --> 05:31.111
The boy, now,
would inherit her destiny.

05:31.640 --> 05:35.349
And Ahmanet understood
power was not given.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.956
It had to be taken.

05:43.720 --> 05:48.157
Vowing revenge,
she made a choice to embrace evil.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.269
Set. The god of death.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.831
They made a pact.

05:58.040 --> 06:01.828
A pact that would
unleash darkness itself.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.950
Ahmanet was reborn

06:53.480 --> 06:55.311
a monster.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.160
Yet the pact was not complete.

07:06.080 --> 07:11.552
She vowed to bring the demon into our
world in the body of a mortal man.

07:12.840 --> 07:16.549
Together, they would take
their vengeance upon humanity.

07:29.680 --> 07:33.719
For her sins,
Ahmanet was mummified alive,

07:41.720 --> 07:44.917
her body carried
far from Egypt.

07:56.880 --> 08:02.079
There she would remain,
condemned to eternal darkness.

08:04.240 --> 08:11.237
But death is a doorway, and the
past cannot remain buried forever.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.758
Out of luck,
huh, Sarge?

08:49.880 --> 08:51.074
The civilians are gone.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.396
It's filled with
insurgents down there.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.075
I guess we're too late.

09:05.480 --> 09:06.480
We can do this.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.431
Oh, no, no, no!
We are too late!

09:09.520 --> 09:11.715
Command thinks we're
doing advanced recon

09:11.800 --> 09:13.552
100 miles from here.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.198
Sarge, you're not
going down there.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.356
You're right, I'm not.

09:17.440 --> 09:18.475
We are.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.073
At least call in
an airstrike.

09:20.200 --> 09:21.633
"Airstrike"?

09:21.720 --> 09:22.720
Bad idea.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.376
A little one. Just...
Maybe they'll run off.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.616
And then command will
know where we are...

09:25.640 --> 09:28.313
And we'll do 20 years in
Leavenworth for looting.

09:28.440 --> 09:31.159
Hey. What'd I tell you?
We are not looters.

09:31.240 --> 09:32.880
We are liberators of
precious antiquities.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.216
Liberators of
precious antiquities.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.240
Right.
Right.

09:35.320 --> 09:36.920
But we don't even
know what's down there.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.476
Haram. Haram is what's
down there. Treasure.

09:40.600 --> 09:44.036
No, the translator said
"haram" means "forbidden knowledge."

09:44.160 --> 09:45.160
Like a curse.

09:45.320 --> 09:47.515
Around here, that's just
another word for "treasure,"

09:47.640 --> 09:50.950
and this guy, this Henry guy,
he seems to want it pretty bad.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.839
Well, now he's gonna
have to pay double.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.760
Mount up. No, sir, I
ain't going on this one.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.034
What?
I'm not going.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.120
Vail.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.440
What are you gonna do,
stab me with that?

10:02.240 --> 10:03.832
Oh, no, no, no!

10:03.960 --> 10:05.154
You crazy bastard.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.835
It's a full day's ride
to the nearest water!

10:08.040 --> 10:10.395
The nearest water
is right down in that village.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.195
Come on, Vail.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.032
Where's your
sense of adventure?

10:14.200 --> 10:17.715
Well, that's just great, Nick.
That's just great!

10:17.800 --> 10:21.190
Come on, slip in, slip out,
just like we always do.

10:22.480 --> 10:23.754
You son of a bitch!

10:23.840 --> 10:24.840
Oh, my God!

10:24.880 --> 10:26.632
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

10:28.440 --> 10:29.759
Move! Move!

10:29.840 --> 10:31.717
Just run! Run, run!

10:34.560 --> 10:35.600
Go, go, go!

10:36.160 --> 10:37.559
You kidding me?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.273
"Slip in, slip out"?

10:43.200 --> 10:44.918
This is not like
we always do!

10:45.080 --> 10:46.559
Stairs! Just run! Run!

10:49.200 --> 10:50.200
Run, run, run!

10:56.760 --> 10:57.760
Grenade!

10:59.600 --> 11:01.318
I hate you!
I hate you so much!

11:01.480 --> 11:04.199
I never even wanted to
come to this country!

11:04.320 --> 11:06.231
Let me think.
Just let me think.

11:07.240 --> 11:11.153
If anyone is listening,
this is L-26, urgent, hot!

11:11.440 --> 11:14.193
Request dynamic precision
strike at our mark!

11:14.400 --> 11:16.914
You did not just
call in an airstrike!

11:17.080 --> 11:19.116
Oh, yes, I did!

11:22.400 --> 11:24.038
Where are you going?
Don't leave me!

11:26.240 --> 11:27.832
Where do they
keep coming from?

11:36.640 --> 11:37.959
There's nowhere to go!

11:38.400 --> 11:39.879
Oh, man!
We're gonna die!

11:39.960 --> 11:41.632
Just, please, Vail!
Let me think!

11:41.800 --> 11:44.030
We're gonna die because of you!
Just let me think!

11:44.200 --> 11:46.270
Think about what?
Think about what?

11:46.720 --> 11:47.835
I'm thinking...

11:49.960 --> 11:50.960
What?

11:51.560 --> 11:52.879
I'm thinking...

11:53.600 --> 11:54.919
What are you thinking?

11:56.640 --> 11:59.632
I'm thinking we're
probably gonna die here.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.434
I knew it!

12:01.640 --> 12:02.640
I knew it!

12:35.440 --> 12:36.509
Huh?

12:36.880 --> 12:39.110
I am still alive!

12:45.560 --> 12:46.560
No!

12:53.880 --> 12:56.394
Nick! Nick!

13:12.920 --> 13:14.069
Haram.

13:18.920 --> 13:19.920
Sir!

13:22.360 --> 13:25.511
I was told you boys were supposed
to be 100 klicks from here!

13:25.600 --> 13:26.600
Yes, sir!

13:26.680 --> 13:28.159
But based
on intelligence,

13:28.240 --> 13:30.151
we had reason to
believe the insurgents

13:30.280 --> 13:32.191
were holding civilian hostages.

13:32.360 --> 13:35.511
We had to make a call, wait for
Delta to respond or go in alone!

13:35.680 --> 13:37.576
It was Sergeant Morton's
idea to go in, actually!

13:37.600 --> 13:38.635
Uh-huh.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.280
Only to find out that the villagers
had long since evacuated.

13:41.360 --> 13:42.839
Yeah, lucky for them,
not for us.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.512
Delta, south-side
perimeter.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.478
Sir,
when we realized

13:46.560 --> 13:48.520
we were in the center of
the insurgent stronghold,

13:48.640 --> 13:49.675
it was too late.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.433
We were discovered,
we started taking on heavy fire.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.517
Well, sir,
Corporal Vail, here,

13:54.600 --> 13:56.272
is too humble
to admit it,

13:56.360 --> 13:59.033
but he risked his
life to save mine.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.634
He's a hero. In fact, I'd
like to recommend him

14:01.720 --> 14:02.948
for a citation.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.751
Let me run another
scenario by you.

14:05.840 --> 14:06.840
Sir?

14:06.920 --> 14:10.754
One in which two assholes from
long-range reconnaissance,

14:10.880 --> 14:12.108
that would be you,

14:12.200 --> 14:15.590
run all over northern Iraq just
one step ahead of the enemy.

14:15.680 --> 14:20.196
Except, instead of hunting for the enemy,
you hunt for antiquities,

14:20.280 --> 14:22.350
stealing whatever
isn't nailed down

14:22.480 --> 14:24.550
and selling it on
the black market.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.870
Meanwhile,
these fanatical insurgents

14:26.960 --> 14:29.110
trying to erase
5,000 years of history

14:29.280 --> 14:32.477
unwittingly cover your tracks.
It's a pretty good scam.

14:32.680 --> 14:33.680
Sergeant Morton!

14:35.120 --> 14:36.439
Where is it?

14:36.560 --> 14:38.357
What? Where's what?

14:38.560 --> 14:41.313
The letter, the map
you stole from me.

14:41.640 --> 14:42.640
Map?

14:42.680 --> 14:44.096
I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:44.120 --> 14:45.917
How would I have
even had an opportunity

14:46.040 --> 14:47.837
to steal anything
from you, Miss...

14:48.560 --> 14:49.754
Miss...

14:51.640 --> 14:52.816
Okay.
Sergeant Morton,

14:52.840 --> 14:54.717
here, thinks that I'll
be too embarrassed

14:54.800 --> 14:57.519
to tell you that I had
him in my hotel room

14:57.600 --> 14:59.238
three nights ago
in Baghdad.

14:59.320 --> 15:02.153
And whilst I was sleeping,
he went through my things.

15:03.480 --> 15:04.629
I'm not embarrassed, Nick.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.068
Disgusted, yes.

15:06.160 --> 15:07.991
Regretful? Certainly.

15:08.120 --> 15:09.997
But mainly,
just amazed at your ability

15:10.160 --> 15:13.152
to mimic all the qualities
of genuine human intimacy

15:13.280 --> 15:15.919
if only for 15 seconds.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.838
Where's the map, Morton?

15:19.200 --> 15:21.839
Okay. Sir, I admit

15:21.920 --> 15:23.399
that Miss Halsey
and I did spend

15:23.680 --> 15:24.920
a delightful
evening in Baghdad.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.520
A very long and
satisfying evening,

15:27.600 --> 15:30.068
if her reactions are to
be considered sincere.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.176
But, sir, I left with nothing
more than fond memories.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.872
Now, perhaps I may
have neglected

15:33.960 --> 15:35.598
to say goodbye to
her the next morning,

15:35.680 --> 15:37.557
only because
she was exhausted

15:37.680 --> 15:39.272
and I didn't wanna wake her.
Okay.

15:39.360 --> 15:41.430
And the reward for my
gracious consideration?

15:41.680 --> 15:44.672
Well, sir, as you can see,
hell hath no fury. Hmm.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.353
- Sir.
- Oh, my God!

15:52.200 --> 15:53.269
It's Egyptian.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.078
Oh, is that
unusual?

15:55.280 --> 15:56.793
We're in the Persian
Gulf, Vail.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.792
Right, Egypt's 1,000 miles away,
so it's unusual.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.916
Put those down, hurry.
Go get the rest.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.035
Got it.

16:03.640 --> 16:05.392
Colonel,
this is a significant find.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.312
I need your men to
secure this village.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.152
We're not even
supposed to be here.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.160
It is my job to make sure
that anything of value

16:11.240 --> 16:12.434
stays out of enemy hands.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.597
We have no idea what
could be down there.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.235
The contents of
Tutankhamun's tomb alone

16:17.320 --> 16:20.357
were valued at 650
million pounds sterling.

16:20.560 --> 16:21.754
Understand?

16:24.280 --> 16:25.554
Oh. Um...

16:25.640 --> 16:27.278
Colonel? If I may.

16:27.360 --> 16:30.056
With a couple of shaped charges, we
could just close this hole right up

16:30.080 --> 16:31.720
and Miss Halsey can
come back another day.

16:31.800 --> 16:32.630
Shut up.
Okay.

16:32.760 --> 16:34.591
You got two hours,
then we're moving out.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.392
You're getting in the
hole with her. Him?

16:36.560 --> 16:37.959
Me?
Yep.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.268
Sir...

16:39.400 --> 16:40.549
You gear up.
That's an order.

16:40.680 --> 16:42.360
I'll be right here
holding the rope, Sarge.

16:42.560 --> 16:43.600
Get in the damn
hole, Vail!

16:43.640 --> 16:44.789
Oh, man!

17:27.640 --> 17:30.279
I'm in a large
antechamber of some kind.

17:30.640 --> 17:34.349
There is an inscription
on the northern wall,

17:34.520 --> 17:35.600
the Litany of Ra.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.318
Are you kidding me?

17:39.320 --> 17:41.276
Your fault, Nick.
Your fault.

17:42.720 --> 17:45.216
Do you see any treasure
in here, Nick? 'Cause I don't.

17:45.240 --> 17:47.629
You know what I see? I see
statues that I can't carry out.

17:47.840 --> 17:49.876
Just keep it down.
You keep it down.

17:50.120 --> 17:51.120
What are you doing?

17:53.440 --> 17:56.273
It is definitely a tomb.

18:07.240 --> 18:08.593
What is that? Mercury?

18:10.040 --> 18:11.040
Yeah.

18:15.440 --> 18:18.512
The ancient Egyptians believed
it weakened evil spirits.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.630
Well, now we know better.
Stuff will kill you.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.193
Yeah, after it makes
you crazy.

18:25.840 --> 18:30.277
There is mercury dripping from
the ceiling into holes in the ground.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.358
Possibly interconnected.

18:34.200 --> 18:37.351
It's a canal system
leading all the way to...

18:41.000 --> 18:42.194
Get the lights!

19:06.520 --> 19:08.397
Oh, my God.

19:30.040 --> 19:31.359
Get everything
out of the bags.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.514
What did I tell you?

19:35.680 --> 19:37.398
That's a
lot of gold, Nick.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.593
I'm in a large, man-made cavern
adjoining the antechamber.

19:41.720 --> 19:44.359
There are chiseled stairs
descending from the ledge.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.152
There is a canal at
the center of them

19:47.160 --> 19:51.358
that feeds a ritual well at the
base, filled with mercury.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.675
Pleated skirts,
scarab signet rings.

19:59.120 --> 20:03.796
This is a High Priest of Amun
from the temple in Thebes.

20:03.880 --> 20:07.429
There is a ritual barrier
chain that surrounds the well

20:08.280 --> 20:09.918
as a warning to intruders.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.229
To keep people out.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.592
There isn't
a single provision

20:17.720 --> 20:20.314
made for someone's journey
into the underworld.

20:21.560 --> 20:23.630
No canopic jars, no shabtis.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.431
To be buried in
a place like this

20:29.560 --> 20:31.312
would have been
a fate worse than death.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Nick!

20:35.800 --> 20:37.552
Don't even think about it.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.835
There are six
watchers around the well

20:44.320 --> 20:46.038
facing inward
instead of out.

20:48.840 --> 20:52.799
Whatever's in there, those chains
aren't for bringing it up.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.752
They're for holding
it down.

21:07.640 --> 21:09.358
This is not a tomb.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.029
It's a prison.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.360
Lima 2-6, come in.

21:16.840 --> 21:17.840
Copy, sir.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.275
Get out now. We got reports
of bogeys inbound.

21:20.360 --> 21:21.588
We gotta take off.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.950
Tell Greenway we
have to notify DTRA.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.359
For what?
I need specialists

21:25.440 --> 21:26.475
- from Cairo...
- Cairo?

21:26.560 --> 21:27.856
...CBRN suits,
and shielding casks.

21:27.880 --> 21:29.836
Jenny,
we are out of time.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.558
You better grab
what you can now!

21:31.720 --> 21:33.816
I am not leaving until
I see what's in that pool.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.990
You're leaving.
We're leaving right now.

21:36.160 --> 21:38.310
I did not come this
far just to leave with...

22:31.480 --> 22:32.959
Oh!

22:34.120 --> 22:35.712
Ahh! Ow!

22:38.040 --> 22:39.268
Hey! Hey!

22:42.600 --> 22:44.033
Cease fire! Vail!

22:44.200 --> 22:46.509
Vail, cease fire!
Cease fire!

22:46.680 --> 22:49.990
They're just camel spiders!
They're not even poisonous!

22:50.160 --> 22:51.832
Can we please leave?

22:52.000 --> 22:53.831
Are you out of your mind, Vail?
Please!

22:53.960 --> 22:55.951
What is wrong with you?
The thing bit me, Nick!

22:56.120 --> 22:57.951
Okay, okay.
It bit me!

22:58.360 --> 23:00.078
Enough of this! I don't care!

23:00.200 --> 23:02.191
I'm leaving! With or
without you, I'm leaving!

23:02.280 --> 23:04.157
It bit me! Please, Nick!

24:11.440 --> 24:12.714
Nick!

24:13.000 --> 24:14.069
Nick!

24:14.320 --> 24:15.514
Nick!

24:15.640 --> 24:17.153
Tell Greenway he's
gonna send a team

24:17.240 --> 24:18.400
to get this thing
out of here,

24:18.880 --> 24:21.314
or he's gonna have to explain
why he left me behind.

24:26.680 --> 24:27.829
Do it!

24:28.560 --> 24:29.560
Okay.

24:44.920 --> 24:46.114
Guidelines are manned!

24:46.200 --> 24:47.336
Guideline is steady.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.032
Move more to
your 9 o'clock!

24:49.200 --> 24:50.110
Holding at 30 feet.

24:50.200 --> 24:51.599
A little more.

25:29.680 --> 25:33.434
Three-eight-Sierra-
four-two-seven-niner-point-six-six-nine.

25:35.640 --> 25:40.589
Go to the MSR, grid two-five-seven-
seven-eight-eight-four.

25:40.680 --> 25:42.033
Bishop to Echo,

25:42.120 --> 25:46.033
we have visual on a severe sandstorm
heading west at angels 12.

26:15.800 --> 26:16.800
Hey!

26:17.040 --> 26:18.040
Hey!

26:18.240 --> 26:19.673
Wait, wait,
please be careful.

26:19.760 --> 26:20.988
This is 5,000
years old.

26:21.200 --> 26:23.668
Sixty seconds!
In the air! Let's go!

26:25.360 --> 26:27.828
Carefully.
Very, very carefully.

26:33.160 --> 26:34.256
Get us off the ground now!

26:34.280 --> 26:35.952
Halsey, take a seat!

27:28.400 --> 27:29.400
Need some help?

27:29.520 --> 27:30.555
No.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.716
You're welcome, by the way.
How's that?

27:33.800 --> 27:36.314
Because I saved
your whatever-it-is.

27:36.800 --> 27:38.791
That was safely
hidden for 5,000 years

27:38.920 --> 27:40.911
before you dropped a
Hellfire missile on it.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.037
And you might never have
found it otherwise.

27:43.680 --> 27:45.398
Again, you're welcome.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.589
Do you have any
idea what this is?

27:51.760 --> 27:53.318
The significance of it?

27:54.560 --> 27:58.155
An Egyptian sarcophagus
in a tomb in Mesopotamia.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.759
Why'd you say
15 seconds?

28:01.880 --> 28:02.995
Why'd I what?

28:03.520 --> 28:05.272
You told Greenway
that I could mimic

28:05.440 --> 28:07.192
all the qualities
of human intimacy

28:07.280 --> 28:08.793
for 15 seconds.

28:08.880 --> 28:11.997
I mean, let me tell you,
it was not 15 seconds.

28:12.200 --> 28:16.273
Well, however long it lasted,
it wasn't real.

28:18.560 --> 28:20.915
I never lied to you
about my feelings.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.792
You stole from me.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.073
But I didn't lie.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.998
Do you ever think of
anyone but yourself?

28:29.160 --> 28:31.628
This means something.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.752
Something bigger
than you can imagine.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.279
My life's work.

28:40.440 --> 28:42.396
And you were
going to steal it.

28:43.480 --> 28:45.994
How much do you figure that's
worth on the black market?

29:09.360 --> 29:13.239
This is Dr. Jennifer Halsey
conducting a preliminary analysis

29:13.320 --> 29:15.117
of an Egyptian sarcophagus

29:15.280 --> 29:18.909
discovered in the Nineveh
province, northern Iraq.

29:19.200 --> 29:22.397
The hieroglyphs are
definitely New Kingdom.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.953
It appears that
the wife of King Menehptre

29:27.400 --> 29:29.675
died in childbirth,

29:29.880 --> 29:32.792
leaving a sole
heir to the throne,

29:33.840 --> 29:35.558
a girl

29:38.600 --> 29:41.956
called Ahmanet.

30:14.640 --> 30:18.679
Corporal, what in
the living hell are you doing, son?

30:19.560 --> 30:20.629
Vail?

30:21.520 --> 30:22.760
Corporal Vail?

30:24.120 --> 30:25.314
Damn it.

30:25.400 --> 30:27.760
Corporal Vail, do you hear me
talking to you? I said what...

30:29.640 --> 30:31.596
Vail, just...

30:32.200 --> 30:33.200
Vail! Whoa, whoa!

30:34.080 --> 30:35.798
Vail!
Oh, my God. Vail!

30:35.920 --> 30:37.216
- Drop your weapon!
- Put it down!

30:37.240 --> 30:38.992
Drop it now!
Please! No, don't!

30:39.360 --> 30:40.076
Drop it, now!

30:40.200 --> 30:41.680
- Put the gun down!
- Drop it!

30:42.400 --> 30:44.840
- Put down the weapon! Put it down! Back off!
- Wait, wait.

30:44.880 --> 30:45.880
Stop! Do not shoot!

30:45.920 --> 30:47.592
This is a pressurized
aircraft! Nick.

30:48.640 --> 30:49.640
What...

30:49.840 --> 30:51.034
Vail.

30:52.680 --> 30:54.398
Vail, put the knife down.
Vail. Vail. Vail.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.896
- Vail, no. No, no!
- Vail! Vail! Vail!

30:55.920 --> 30:57.069
Vail! Vail!

31:03.120 --> 31:05.588
Okay, Vail, stop.
Stop! Vail, Vail, Vail!

31:22.880 --> 31:24.108
I'm sorry.

31:33.720 --> 31:34.914
Pan, Pan, Pan!

31:35.000 --> 31:36.797
This is November
four-zero-niner-niner,

31:36.920 --> 31:39.256
United States C-130 Hercules
inbound 6 miles off the coast...

31:39.280 --> 31:41.111
What's happening?
Take your seat and strap in.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.150
...of Dover, England.
England?

31:42.320 --> 31:43.696
Ma'am, I don't
know what's happening.

31:43.720 --> 31:44.720
Take a seat!

31:46.920 --> 31:48.520
We lost thrust
in both engines.

31:48.560 --> 31:49.470
No radar contact.

31:49.560 --> 31:51.120
Dropping to 12,000,
280 on the heading.

31:51.160 --> 31:52.991
What the hell is that?

31:55.600 --> 31:56.600
Go, go, go!

32:09.440 --> 32:10.634
Parachute!

32:12.120 --> 32:13.314
Parachute!

32:22.680 --> 32:23.590
I don't know
how to do this!

32:23.680 --> 32:25.796
Jenny, Jenny, you can do this.
You can do this.

32:46.920 --> 32:49.195
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

33:42.680 --> 33:44.376
It's an awful thing
to have to ask, I know.

33:44.400 --> 33:45.992
It's most irregular.

33:46.160 --> 33:48.549
Noted, Doctor.
Thank you.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.515
We'll let Miss
Halsey decide.

33:53.800 --> 33:55.199
Miss Halsey?

33:56.840 --> 33:58.796
Miss Halsey, do you
think you're up to it?

33:59.640 --> 34:01.073
I'm sorry, what?

34:01.160 --> 34:03.993
We need your help
identifying the bodies.

34:54.239 --> 34:55.514
Whoa!

34:57.680 --> 34:58.795
Vail!

34:59.520 --> 35:00.839
Hey, buddy.

35:02.320 --> 35:04.197
You scared
the shit out of me.

35:06.240 --> 35:08.674
We need to talk, Nick.

35:11.240 --> 35:13.071
What's...
What's happening?

35:14.400 --> 35:17.039
You know
what's happening.

35:19.280 --> 35:21.271
Am I dead?

35:22.400 --> 35:23.469
Dead?

35:24.160 --> 35:26.549
No, but you're
gonna wish you were.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.319
Right this way,
please.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.353
- Oh, my God! Nick.
- Oh!

35:30.640 --> 35:32.471
Jen... Oh!

35:35.640 --> 35:37.437
What's happening?
Where am I?

35:37.520 --> 35:38.714
Who's in charge here?

35:39.720 --> 35:40.720
Uh...

35:42.440 --> 35:44.136
Base, this is Search Team One.

35:44.160 --> 35:45.400
Looks like
the trail of wreckage

35:45.520 --> 35:48.671
spread across two, two and a
half miles through the forest.

35:48.760 --> 35:50.273
Coming up on
Aylesford Pier now.

35:50.360 --> 35:51.509
Stand by.

35:55.600 --> 35:56.828
Pier's a wreck.

35:56.920 --> 35:59.150
Looks like part of the wing.
A turbine.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.880
Miles away from
the primary crash site. Over.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.296
Copy, Search Team One.

36:03.320 --> 36:04.548
Message received.

36:16.280 --> 36:19.590
One body found, no obvious
signs of life. Stand by.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.759
Casualty confirmed,
deceased.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.309
Request attendance
of ambulance personnel. Over.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.336
Copy, Search Team One.

36:32.360 --> 36:34.715
Ambulance personnel en route.
Over.

36:36.240 --> 36:39.550
We got aircraft debris scattered
across the north side of the banks,

36:39.640 --> 36:42.950
still alight, but no immediate
danger or threat. Over.

37:40.080 --> 37:41.718
What?

37:41.800 --> 37:43.313
What the hell?

37:46.240 --> 37:48.674
Hey! You better come and look at...

37:49.360 --> 37:50.588
Allen?

37:51.680 --> 37:52.795
Allen?

37:53.200 --> 37:54.315
You all right?

37:56.440 --> 37:57.509
Allen!

38:00.840 --> 38:04.753
Jesus!

39:36.040 --> 39:37.616
A United States military plane

39:37.640 --> 39:39.392
crash-landed in Surrey
this evening,

39:39.560 --> 39:41.596
just missing Waverley Abbey.

39:42.440 --> 39:44.351
How did you get
out of that plane?

39:45.880 --> 39:48.189
There's not a single
scratch on your body.

39:49.160 --> 39:51.196
Yeah.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.228
Thank you.

39:58.200 --> 39:59.428
For what?

39:59.760 --> 40:01.239
You saved my life.

40:01.960 --> 40:04.076
You'd have done
the same for me.

40:05.400 --> 40:06.515
Nick.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.069
Nick.

40:10.120 --> 40:11.120
Listen, Nick.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.394
I...

40:12.560 --> 40:14.073
I think you
should know something.

40:14.160 --> 40:16.833
You know I work with
a group of archeologists.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.189
Yeah.
Well,

40:18.280 --> 40:19.793
we've developed
this theory

40:19.880 --> 40:23.839
that an Egyptian princess had been
erased from the history books

40:25.280 --> 40:26.349
deliberately.

40:27.600 --> 40:31.070
We've been searching for something
called the Dagger of Set.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.231
A ceremonial knife with a
large jewel at the hilt.

40:35.680 --> 40:37.910
Set is the Egyptian
god of death.

40:38.480 --> 40:42.029
And legend has it that the
dagger and the stone, together,

40:42.440 --> 40:45.512
had the power to
give Set physical form.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.709
I'm convinced it was
hidden here in Europe.

40:49.120 --> 40:51.350
Stolen by Crusaders
centuries ago.

40:52.040 --> 40:55.510
I found reference to it in a manuscript
written by a Crusader knight

40:56.640 --> 41:00.189
that suggested the dagger was broken apart.

41:00.560 --> 41:05.395
That the stone was buried with this
knight somewhere here in England.

41:06.880 --> 41:10.953
A massive Crusader tomb was
recently discovered under London.

41:12.960 --> 41:16.077
We believe that the stone
is in there somewhere.

41:17.520 --> 41:20.637
That tomb is what
led us to Ahmanet.

41:21.640 --> 41:23.995
I think she's the
princess in the legend.

41:24.080 --> 41:26.389
The hieroglyphs said
she murdered her father.

41:26.560 --> 41:28.915
Murdered?
Along with his child.

41:29.360 --> 41:32.591
She made some sort of pact
with the god of death.

41:32.800 --> 41:34.279
And then, when I
saw those birds,

41:35.680 --> 41:38.240
and that sandstorm... You know, I mean...
Something is happening.

41:38.760 --> 41:41.115
You're alive and
I don't know how.

41:41.280 --> 41:42.872
You. Me. Go.

41:43.240 --> 41:46.232
I'm sorry, Nick. I think
we've angered the gods.

41:49.160 --> 41:50.513
Would you excuse me?

41:50.760 --> 41:52.318
I'll be right back.

41:55.880 --> 41:56.936
Identify, please.

41:56.960 --> 41:58.080
This is Jenny. Get me Henry.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
Jennifer.

42:10.080 --> 42:13.516
This is a far more significant
problem than we had ever imagined.

42:13.760 --> 42:16.115
Something is happening, Henry.
I'm worried about him.

42:16.280 --> 42:17.872
Bring your soldier to London.

42:17.960 --> 42:19.996
Do not discuss
anything further with him.

42:20.080 --> 42:21.399
Understand?

42:22.360 --> 42:23.634
What are you doing here?

42:23.800 --> 42:24.800
Jenny looks good.

42:24.880 --> 42:26.800
Okay, this isn't happening.
I mean, really great.

42:26.960 --> 42:27.995
Okay, really. Stop.

42:28.240 --> 42:29.776
You know, I always thought
I had a chance with her.

42:29.800 --> 42:31.756
What?
How do you squander that?

42:31.960 --> 42:33.656
There was mercury in that tomb.
The vapors were toxic.

42:33.680 --> 42:34.920
I mean,
how do you mess that up?

42:35.240 --> 42:36.036
It's just in my head,
it's in my head.

42:36.160 --> 42:37.718
No, it's not.

42:38.320 --> 42:39.548
You shot me.

42:40.320 --> 42:43.471
Wait, wait. Wait,
wait, wait. You... You...

42:45.120 --> 42:46.155
You

42:47.520 --> 42:48.999
stabbed Greenway.

42:49.080 --> 42:50.877
I saved you...
You murdered him.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
...and you shot me.

42:52.280 --> 42:55.192
You tried to kill me.
You even went after Jenny.

42:55.320 --> 42:57.595
You shot me. Three times.

42:59.160 --> 43:01.037
Yes.
Three times, Nick.

43:01.960 --> 43:03.837
Okay, the third
one was unnecessary.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.596
You freaked me out,
I panicked.

43:07.480 --> 43:09.755
I'm sorry. Okay?
Not okay.

43:09.960 --> 43:11.996
Look at me. Look at my face.

43:12.080 --> 43:13.991
I'm cursed, Nick.
And you're cursed.

43:14.160 --> 43:16.276
And there's only
one way to break it.

43:16.360 --> 43:19.113
You are going to do
exactly what she wants,

43:19.240 --> 43:22.118
or this is gonna get a lot
worse for both of us.

43:22.680 --> 43:23.874
What do you mean, I'm cursed?

43:25.240 --> 43:26.240
I'm sorry.

43:26.320 --> 43:28.390
Just give me a minute.
Thank you.

43:28.520 --> 43:30.556
You walked into the chicks'
bathroom, by the way.

43:30.680 --> 43:31.816
Go to your
own sodding loo!

43:31.840 --> 43:33.656
- Yeah, it's a ladies' room.
- We just want to pee!

43:33.680 --> 43:34.856
What do you mean,
I'm cursed?

43:34.880 --> 43:36.518
How do you think you
survived the crash?

43:39.120 --> 43:40.553
Setepa-i.

43:40.720 --> 43:42.176
- Bloody Yanks. Unbelievable.
- Yeah!

43:42.200 --> 43:44.077
You know
what it means.

43:45.680 --> 43:47.272
She's got plans
for you, Nick.

43:48.320 --> 43:50.436
Plans?
You can't run.

43:51.520 --> 43:53.795
You can't escape.

45:07.360 --> 45:08.429
Help me!

45:09.120 --> 45:10.348
Help me!

45:20.840 --> 45:22.876
Setepa-i!

45:24.120 --> 45:27.476
Out of the road, wanker!

45:27.600 --> 45:29.875
Nick! What the hell
are you doing?

45:30.960 --> 45:32.154
Okay, you were right.

45:33.280 --> 45:35.748
We've angered the gods.
Wait, what?

45:35.840 --> 45:38.354
I saw her.
The chick in the box.

45:38.560 --> 45:39.629
Ahmanet?
That one.

45:39.720 --> 45:41.039
Nick...
He said I'm cursed.

45:41.200 --> 45:42.200
Who said?
Vail.

45:42.360 --> 45:43.509
Vail?
The coffin we found.

45:43.760 --> 45:44.760
Sarcophagus.
Whatever.

45:44.840 --> 45:46.990
There was writing on it.
Hieroglyphics.

45:47.160 --> 45:48.991
Jenny, respectfully,
I'm not interested

45:49.080 --> 45:50.832
in archeological
jargon right now.

45:50.920 --> 45:53.832
The writing on the box that
we took out of the hole.

45:54.200 --> 45:55.030
Yes, sorry.

45:55.160 --> 45:57.400
There was something about a
curse on there, wasn't there?

45:57.480 --> 45:59.789
Nick, you've had
a concussion.

45:59.920 --> 46:01.558
Yes.
Toxic exposure.

46:01.720 --> 46:03.756
How does that
explain that I know

46:03.880 --> 46:05.950
that Setepa-i
means "my chosen"?

46:06.640 --> 46:09.200
That's ancient Egyptian.
Ancient Egyptian.

46:09.320 --> 46:10.230
How do I know that?

46:10.320 --> 46:11.656
You've been in the
Middle East for years.

46:11.680 --> 46:13.318
What? No! You heard
it, you forgot it.

46:13.400 --> 46:15.960
Why are you backing off from this?
I'm telling you.

46:16.040 --> 46:17.109
She is real.

46:26.960 --> 46:28.075
Nick.

46:30.040 --> 46:31.473
Nick, what is it?

46:33.640 --> 46:36.313
I think you're right.
I...

46:36.400 --> 46:37.753
I think this is
all in my head.

46:38.600 --> 46:40.272
We should find the box,
look inside,

46:40.400 --> 46:42.595
and when I see a 3,000-year-old
prune in there...

46:42.680 --> 46:44.398
Nick.
...no more curse.

46:44.560 --> 46:46.516
You don't need a sarcophagus,
you need a doctor.

46:46.680 --> 46:47.908
I know someone.

46:48.520 --> 46:49.714
A specialist in London.

46:50.160 --> 46:52.390
Don't tell me that you
don't wanna see it, too.

46:52.520 --> 46:53.794
Your life's work.

46:53.880 --> 46:55.279
Come on, Jenny.

46:56.400 --> 46:58.436
I think I know
where it is.

47:00.440 --> 47:02.635
Charlie 8-1.
Charlie 8-1 to Base.

47:02.840 --> 47:06.230
We are at the main crash site,
400 meters north of Waverley Abbey.

47:06.400 --> 47:10.029
Firefighters are containing the
wreckage, but the site is still hot.

47:50.960 --> 47:51.995
Nick.

47:54.360 --> 47:56.828
Nick! Where are
you going?

47:56.960 --> 47:58.936
The crash site is up that way.
Where are you going?

47:58.960 --> 48:01.190
No. We're in
the right place.

48:06.640 --> 48:07.755
Nick.

48:09.880 --> 48:11.233
Nick!

48:11.320 --> 48:13.231
I don't know what
we're doing here.

48:13.320 --> 48:15.675
This isn't
the right place.

48:15.760 --> 48:17.432
Yes, it is.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.272
No, it isn't.

48:19.360 --> 48:23.239
The main crash site is up that
way, and so is my artifact.

48:23.320 --> 48:24.594
And that's where
we're going.

48:48.120 --> 48:49.917
Setepa-i.

49:00.320 --> 49:01.833
What the hell?

49:03.680 --> 49:04.795
How did I...

49:14.480 --> 49:15.515
Jenny?

49:29.120 --> 49:30.235
Okay.

49:34.920 --> 49:36.035
Nick?

50:03.600 --> 50:04.600
Ah...

50:16.280 --> 50:17.395
Okay.

50:17.600 --> 50:18.715
Okay.

50:21.760 --> 50:22.875
No, seriously...

50:25.760 --> 50:27.040
What?

50:32.360 --> 50:33.952
I'm sorry, what?

50:41.120 --> 50:42.269
Oh, God.

50:52.960 --> 50:55.155
No, no, no.

50:56.560 --> 50:57.560
No, please.

51:18.320 --> 51:19.355
Jenny!

51:20.800 --> 51:21.800
Yeah?

51:22.160 --> 51:23.991
Run! Run!

51:51.840 --> 51:52.840
Ugh!

52:06.560 --> 52:07.709
Come on!
Come on!

52:12.200 --> 52:13.997
Nick! Nick!

52:15.040 --> 52:16.075
Nick!

52:16.720 --> 52:17.914
Hey! Hey!

52:20.240 --> 52:22.231
No, no, no! Hey!

52:22.440 --> 52:24.510
Hey! Nick! Stop!

52:24.680 --> 52:25.680
Nick!

52:27.320 --> 52:28.514
Were you just gonna
leave me?

52:28.680 --> 52:30.716
You saw that, right?
You were gonna leave me!

52:30.880 --> 52:32.598
You saw it, right?
I can't unsee it!

52:35.560 --> 52:36.560
Where are we going?

52:36.600 --> 52:38.909
Away from here. There's
a highway up ahead.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.399
How do you know?
I know.

52:42.800 --> 52:45.075
Oh, my God. Do you
realize what this is?

52:45.200 --> 52:46.360
It's the Dagger of Set.

52:46.400 --> 52:48.550
She was gonna drive that
thing right through me.

52:48.720 --> 52:50.551
The stone,
it is missing.

52:50.680 --> 52:52.352
Yeah, that seemed to
really piss her off.

52:52.640 --> 52:53.959
It's real.

52:58.120 --> 52:59.439
How was it in a statue?

52:59.920 --> 53:01.717
That statue was
a reliquary.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.673
Crusaders would use them
to hide holy relics.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.319
But she knew
it was there.

53:08.200 --> 53:11.033
What... You're saying that she
brought the plane down there?

53:11.120 --> 53:12.155
On purpose?

53:12.280 --> 53:14.160
That's why she wanted you
to come to the church.

53:14.240 --> 53:15.416
She wanted me to
go to the church?

53:15.440 --> 53:17.954
I told you that I wanted
to go to the church.

53:18.080 --> 53:20.514
I told you,
I said I wanted to see...

53:21.600 --> 53:24.831
I wanted to see her corpse.
See her corpse.

53:27.440 --> 53:30.273
Nick, she's in
your head.

53:30.440 --> 53:33.273
What are you talking about?
That is ridiculous. Because I...

53:38.000 --> 53:39.353
I drove
right back to her.

53:39.480 --> 53:41.118
Oh, my God,
she's in my head.

53:54.960 --> 53:56.837
Go, go, go!

54:09.480 --> 54:10.833
Get it off me!

54:15.160 --> 54:16.479
Son of a bitch!

54:36.520 --> 54:38.511
That's my face! That's my face!
That's my face!

54:38.600 --> 54:39.669
Sorry!

54:42.920 --> 54:43.920
Nick!

55:02.080 --> 55:03.115
Nick!

55:16.240 --> 55:17.389
Jenny?

55:20.560 --> 55:22.437
Jenny. Jenny.

55:22.600 --> 55:23.874
Nick! Nick!

55:39.080 --> 55:40.115
Okay.

55:41.280 --> 55:42.429
All right.

55:42.600 --> 55:43.600
Get her, Nick!

55:45.600 --> 55:47.113
Get her! Get her!

55:49.520 --> 55:50.520
Kick her ass!

56:10.160 --> 56:11.480
Route is clear. Come on!

56:19.280 --> 56:22.041
That's it, pull her back tight!

56:24.920 --> 56:26.592
Delta Team, move!

56:26.800 --> 56:28.028
Bring target down!

56:32.400 --> 56:33.435
Clear!

56:43.760 --> 56:44.795
Who are you...

57:04.880 --> 57:06.029
Where are you taking me?

57:08.440 --> 57:09.589
What's happening?

57:55.720 --> 57:56.869
Stay.

58:16.680 --> 58:18.398
Make yourself comfortable.

58:22.720 --> 58:24.233
Who the hell are you?

58:24.920 --> 58:26.148
Who am I?

58:27.920 --> 58:31.435
The more relevant question,
Mr. Morton,

58:31.520 --> 58:33.158
is who exactly are you?

58:34.720 --> 58:37.029
In theory,
I know all about you.

58:37.720 --> 58:40.678
Army reconnaissance,
decorated soldier,

58:40.840 --> 58:44.469
and page after page indicating a
deep and troubling moral turpitude.

58:44.600 --> 58:45.919
But, you see,
this file contains

58:46.080 --> 58:47.399
nothing of any
real value to me.

58:47.480 --> 58:49.471
That's why I wanted to
see you face-to-face.

58:51.040 --> 58:52.439
Who are you?

58:52.520 --> 58:53.999
I'm a doctor.

58:54.080 --> 58:55.115
A doctor.

58:55.640 --> 58:57.517
Chemical pathology,
neurosurgery.

58:57.600 --> 58:59.431
Fellow of the Royal Society.

59:00.800 --> 59:02.279
I'm also a lawyer.

59:03.400 --> 59:04.674
My name is Jekyll.

59:06.600 --> 59:08.079
Dr. Henry Jekyll.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.149
There you are.

59:12.720 --> 59:16.474
These days,
I specialize in immunology, perhaps.

59:19.320 --> 59:21.675
Infectious disease, perhaps.

59:21.760 --> 59:24.399
I would like, if I may,
Mr. Morton,

59:26.040 --> 59:27.792
to tell you a story.

59:28.560 --> 59:31.552
A story about
a patient of mine.

59:32.480 --> 59:34.471
A man of promise.

59:34.840 --> 59:36.990
A man who believed
he was beyond reproach

59:38.200 --> 59:40.156
until he got ill.

59:40.920 --> 59:44.037
The disease manifested itself
in subtle ways, at first.

59:44.680 --> 59:46.511
And then it grew

59:46.600 --> 59:50.798
into an overwhelming desire,
an unquenchable thirst...

59:56.480 --> 59:57.760
...for chaos.

59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.994
For the suffering of others.

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.399
He was quite fortunate.

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.749
He himself
was a physician.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.274
And if evil were a pathogen,
he reasoned,

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.868
then there must
surely be a cure.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.758
I would like, if I may,
Mr. Morton,

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.557
to show you something.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.673
Welcome to Prodigium,
Mr. Morton.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:10.029
From the Latin,
monstrum vel prodigium.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.350
"A warning of monsters."

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.429
Forgive the state of things.

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.795
We had very little time
to prepare for our guest

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.920
and only the information
Jennifer provided to go on.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.910
In truth,
she works for us.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.871
It's not an exact science,
this business.

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:28.720
What?

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.277
And the business being?

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.270
Evil, Mr. Morton.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.557
Recognize, contain,
examine, destroy.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.437
She is by far the most ancient
we've ever encountered.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.829
What are you doing to her?

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.596
Embalming her
with mercury.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.993
At minus 38 degrees

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.310
the mercury in her veins
will solidify,

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.670
and she should be
safe for dissection then.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:06.558
Dissection?
You said that we'd study her.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.836
Yes, by dissection.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.918
But she's a living witness to a
history that we barely know.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.176
She's a threat, Jennifer.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.475
Hold on, hold on.
So, where does that leave me?

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.351
Cursed, Mr. Morton.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.755
This is not some
common cold you have.

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.310
Some chicken soup and a good night's
sleep will not make it go away.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:29.397
You have been selected as the
vessel for the ultimate evil.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.479
And we are the only ones
who can rectify that.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.200
No.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.191
I was going to give him

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.552
eternal life.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:21.389
Make him a living god.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.879
You murdered your father.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.033
I loved my father

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.431
with all my heart.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:34.273
I only wanted
his love in return.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.469
You killed his wife.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.349
Their child.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:47.750
They were different times.

01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:00.316
The Day of Awakening
will soon be upon us.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.078
You will become Set.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.834
The world will
fall to your desire.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.113
You will have power
of life over death.

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:18.792
And you will have me.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.798
I will be your queen.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.468
Just give in.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.755
Nick.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.749
Nick. Wake up.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.239
Wake up.

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:37.676
They will kill you, just as they
killed my chosen before you.

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.593
It burns.

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:54.629
What?

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.193
It burns!

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:01.989
Stop it!

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.160
Stop it! Stop!

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.669
Stop!

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.038
Stop it!

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.309
Stop!

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.633
Fascinating.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.355
What was I
supposed to tell you?

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.276
Would you even
have believed me

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.391
if I'd said this
place was real?

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.229
When Henry came to me,

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:37.193
I took the job because
we had a common interest.

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.956
So, you're using
each other.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.271
Now she's using you.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.155
Look.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.795
Despite what
you might think,

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.073
despite my...

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.918
My better judgment,

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.872
I care about you.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.273
Somewhere in there,
fighting to get out,

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.073
is a good man.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.872
You don't know that.

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:14.709
I do.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.153
How?

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.829
You saved my life
on that plane.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:28.716
You gave me the only parachute
without hesitation.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:38.039
I thought
there was another one.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.511
Mr. Morton.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.229
Drink?

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.637
I think
I've found something.

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:51.359
The "old" gods?

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:58.751
Your language is simple.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:03.591
What you truly wish
to know is

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:08.749
what lies beyond
the veil of death.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:14.517
To know what I have seen?

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.469
Yes.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.877
And you will,

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:22.993
when I

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.638
kill you.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.073
They have found the stone.

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:40.358
You brought my chosen here.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:46.236
What do you think
they will do with him now?

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:03.319
Huh.

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:08.393
Welcome to a new world
of gods and monsters.

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.511
Evil has many names,
Mr. Morton. Mmm.

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.718
Take Set, for example.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.554
Known to Egyptians
as the god of death.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.156
Mmm. In the Old Testament,
Satan, Lucifer.

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.957
The devil.
Quite so.

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.712
Yeah. Bad... Badness.
Got it.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.636
So, you see,
evil is the shadow

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.075
that exists just outside our world...
Uh-huh.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:33.590
...continuously searching
for a way to come in.

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.640
For a way to
become flesh and blood.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.791
Either we wait
for that day to arrive,

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.359
or we can fight it
on our own terms.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.353
Which brings me to you.

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.590
Me? Yeah, great.
Yes, Doc.

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.437
You said you could cure me of this curse.
Get rid of it.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.556
So, let's do it, Doc.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.793
What's your plan?

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.794
Mr. Morton,
these things are complex.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.274
Yeah. I bet, I bet.

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:17.998
When one is dealing with
the salvation of humanity,

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:21.394
certain sacrifices
must be made.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:22.794
Excuse me, sir.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:26.949
They found it.

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.433
Found what?

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:31.835
Henry.

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.639
Are you planning
on killing him?

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:35.800
Kill?

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.319
Jennifer...
Kill who?

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:40.153
Mr. Morton, here,
essentially killed himself

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.158
when he severed
the barrier chain

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.754
that had kept Ahmanet's power
imprisoned for 5,000 years.

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:52.030
He was chosen
as her ideal candidate.

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.791
A thief, physically capable,
compulsively devious,

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.319
and utterly devoid of soul.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.714
What?
What?

01:10:58.920 --> 01:10:59.830
That's insane.

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:02.434
You want to put the stone in the
dagger and stab him with it?

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:05.478
Well, the dagger will allow
Set to enter his body,

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:07.949
and then, we obliterate it.

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:08.990
Wait, wait, wait.

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.752
You wanna stab me
with that thing?

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:11.989
Intentionally?

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.515
Precisely what the Egyptians
should have done.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:20.033
You see, they interrupted
a ritual in process,

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.873
and that is a mistake
we cannot...

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.392
...afford to repeat.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.200
What?

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.753
That's the plan?

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.280
Henry,
you can't possibly do this.

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.240
That's your plan?

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:35.914
The dominoes
are already falling.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.513
We haven't much time.

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:41.030
Unfortunately,
it is a risk we must take.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.879
That's really your plan?

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.638
You heard Ahmanet.

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:47.234
Your curse cannot be broken.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.719
I am truly sorry, Mr. Morton.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:52.714
No matter what I do,
you are going to die.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:56.314
Yes, evil is a disease.

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.315
A pestilent,
pustulant infection

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.715
burrowing its way
into our souls.

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.595
The world needs a cure.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.070
You can be that cure.
Stop.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.696
A sacrifice for the greater good!
Just stop.

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:11.312
I'm not interested
in that at all.

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.351
Okay.

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:14.560
Don't!
Give me the injector.

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:15.896
Okay, we're just
gonna take a minute,

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.911
and we're all gonna
come up with a new plan.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.896
We have to go. You don't
know what you're doing.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.400
Really? I know
exactly what I'm doing.

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.856
Oh, my dear Henry Jekyll,

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.440
if ever I've seen Satan's
signature upon a face,

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.111
it is on that of
your new friend.

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.278
Okay, hey, hey, hey!
Take it!

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.509
Now!

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.278
Run, Mr. Morton.
What?

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.839
Run!

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.115
Nick! Open the door!

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.275
You don't want that.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.319
Stop! Jenny!

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.595
Stop!

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.677
They won't
let me out, Nicholas.

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:15.988
They never do.

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:23.275
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:24.390
What's happening?

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.840
Did you just shut
down the mercury?

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:27.349
Pete?

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:39.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.836
You are a younger man,

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:44.520
but you'd best learn to be
wary of a man like me.

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:58.309
It's not me that wants
to kill you, it's Henry.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.555
I have something more
collaborative in mind.

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:03.360
Oh, nice.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.518
I'm offering
you a partnership.

01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:26.193
You, Evil Incarnate.

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.998
Me, your good friend,
Eddie Hyde.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.195
Think about it.

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.029
Jenny!

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.029
Oh, come on.

01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.039
Jenny, stop!

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.319
Come on, son.
Think about it.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.755
Mayhem, chaos, destruction.

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.234
The ladies will love us.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:10.880
Come here.

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:17.109
I do enjoy
the countenance of pain.

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.428
Well done, Mr. Morton. Well done.

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.515
Come on. We have to
destroy the stone.

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.750
What?
No stone, no ritual.

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:56.840
No ritual...

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.513
No curse.
Yes.

01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.868
I know where it is.

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:31.560
Nick! Nick!

01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:59.836
Just wait, wait.
Which way out?

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.035
I don't know.

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:54.315
Hello?

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.955
She's out! She has the dagger.

01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.752
We think she's coming to you.
So are we.

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.634
Lock your doors
and secure that stone.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.513
Nick! Nick!

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:10.829
Let's go!

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.393
I know where the stone is!

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:13.755
Let's go!

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:34.638
Wow, that was intense!

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.792
Okay, follow me.

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.296
We're heading
to the Crusader burial chamber.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.517
We'll make our entry through the
northwest train tunnels. Over.

01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.758
This is the moment, Nick.

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:01.558
This is the moment!

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.034
Yeah, you're damn right.

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.760
I'm gonna take you to that stone,
deliver you to Ahmanet,

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:08.275
then my work here is done.

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:10.029
What?

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:12.435
Nick?

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:14.555
Jenny?

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:19.600
Hey, buddy.

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:23.994
Ahmanet is never
going to let her live.

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.479
You can't save her.

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.832
Oh, no! Move!

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:09.589
Nick?

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:21.715
Nick?

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.275
Nick?

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.310
You shouldn't be here.
I followed you!

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.155
Go, go, go!

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.237
Are you okay? Are you okay?

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.753
Where are we?
I don't know.

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.394
I don't know.

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:50.959
Are you okay?

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:52.837
I'm scared.
Just look at me.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.672
We're gonna figure this out.
Just...

01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.950
You just stay with me, please.

01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:00.073
We're gonna figure this out.
Okay? You just stay with me.

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.353
Just stay with me.
We'll figure this out.

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.600
Okay, it's gonna be okay...

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.558
Ah! No! Jenny!

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.511
Jenny! No! No!

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:54.908
Don't!

01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:56.399
Let go!

01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:58.720
Jenny!

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:06.276
Jenny! Jenny!

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.877
No!

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:34.198
Don't blame yourself.

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.876
She was always doomed.

01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:58.871
There are worse fates
than death.

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:15.279
Come to me.

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.039
It hurts.

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:39.874
I know.

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.873
Let me take the pain away.

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:11.159
Give in to me.

01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:24.760
Oh. Uh...

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:46.959
Give in.

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:49.751
Give in.

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.313
When it's over,

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:56.711
you will thank me.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.672
I promise.

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:07.239
I'm sorry.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.911
We're just
never gonna happen.

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.033
And it's not me.

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.114
It's you.

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:41.278
Thief.

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.319
Wait!

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:58.311
Destroy the stone
and all is lost.

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:03.679
You will be a living god.

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:10.957
You will have power
of life over death.

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:18.439
Give it to me,

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:21.793
my chosen.

01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:29.031
Give it to me,

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:31.113
my love.

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.709
Setepa-i.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.798
Somewhere in there,
I know you're a good man.

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.278
The world needs a cure.

01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:42.833
You can be that cure.

01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:46.796
A sacrifice for
the greater good!

01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:54.988
Jenny.

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:57.553
Wake up, wake up.

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:01.794
Wake up. Wake up.

01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:05.473
I'm sorry.

01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:07.392
I'm sorry, Jenny.

01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:11.549
Jenny.

01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:17.597
Jenny, please, wake up.

01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:20.995
I'm sorry.

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:23.230
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:24.389
Just, please, wake up.

01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:30.200
Jenny.

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:31.834
Wake up, please.

01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:34.680
Just...

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.229
Jenny, please, just wake up!

01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:55.636
Nick? Nick.

01:34:57.680 --> 01:34:59.671
Nick. Nick.

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:31.636
Nick...

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:37.800
Nick.

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:40.995
Nick. Nick?

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:42.275
Stop!

01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:44.638
Stop. Please.

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:50.075
I don't know what I am.

01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:54.240
I don't want to
hurt you, Jenny.

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:55.355
You're alive.

01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:57.759
You're alive.

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.990
I'm so glad you're alive.

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:03.828
Oh, Nick.

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:07.879
You did this for me?

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:10.794
Yes.

01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:16.353
I have made so many,
many mistakes.

01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:19.951
But not this time.

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:22.399
Not you.

01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:26.591
I don't want to hurt you.

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:29.796
I never wanted to hurt you.

01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:32.559
You won't.

01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:38.030
Didn't see this coming,
did we?

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.877
They're coming for me.

01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:52.914
I wish we had more time.

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:56.518
I'll find you.

01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:00.395
Goodbye, Jenny.

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.436
You were wrong
about Nick.

01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:39.554
He gave his life to save me.

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:42.958
To bring me back.

01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:48.598
Yes, Jennifer.

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:53.113
He found his redemption,
but at great cost.

01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:56.871
He is a monster now.

01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:00.235
He is also still a man.

01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:02.319
A good man.

01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:04.553
Perhaps.

01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:08.278
Yet he has only begun
to discover his power.

01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:11.992
And we cannot know
which side will win out.

01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:15.431
Between darkness and light,

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.238
good or evil.

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:20.951
Hey, Nick? Nick.

01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:24.791
I'm really glad to be here.

01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:27.080
I mean,
thank you for bringing me

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:28.912
back to life
and everything, Nick.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.991
But what are we
even doing here?

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:33.511
Where are we going?

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.192
Come on, my friend.

01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:39.075
Where's your
sense of adventure?

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:44.509
Oh, no.

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.750
Whatever human
part of him remains

01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:52.513
will search the world over
for a way to break the curse.

01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:54.913
To find a cure.

01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:58.196
Yet evil never rests.

01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:01.235
And it will call to him

01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.117
always.

01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:07.109
Henry, he used
his power to stop Ahmanet.

01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:11.592
You know more than anyone
he could be our greatest ally.

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.508
Perhaps.

01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:19.631
Sometimes, it does take a
monster to fight a monster.
