00:09.240 --> 00:11.242
The core compression algorithm is optimal.

00:11.320 --> 00:12.685
All the test cases ran optimal.

00:12.760 --> 00:16.731
The Weissman Score is optimal.
Looks like Nucleus is optimal.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.529
Good. Good.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.651
Congratulations, guys.

00:24.440 --> 00:25.680
- Oh, yeah.
- A dunk.

00:34.160 --> 00:39.644
Richard, the ingestion engine is ready
for testing. Have you seen Richard?

00:39.720 --> 00:42.644
He's in there, having a little trouble
with his personal ingestion engine.

00:42.720 --> 00:45.883
Still? It's been an hour.
He's gotta get this done.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.804
Oh, he's got his laptop in there,
on top of his lap.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.728
Hey, Richard.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.609
Don't talk to me while
I'm in the bathroom please.

00:53.680 --> 00:55.330
Well, snap it off, we gotta go.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.402
I know.
Just don't talk to me while I'm in here.

00:57.480 --> 00:58.561
It's weird.

00:58.640 --> 01:01.086
Oh, my God.
Jared's been back from that island

01:01.160 --> 01:03.288
for a whole day
and he didn't get any toilet paper?

01:03.360 --> 01:05.681
Are you serious? ls Jared out there?

01:05.760 --> 01:07.569
I thought you didn't want me to talk to you

01:07.640 --> 01:09.600
while you were in the bathroom.
Make up your mind.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.688
You know what?
Just get away from the door, please.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.484
Friday, the pool cleaner comes.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.130
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

01:15.240 --> 01:18.289
And tomorrow is trash day
so make sure all the cans are out front.

01:18.360 --> 01:19.805
Yes.

01:19.880 --> 01:23.885
Now, you are under no circumstances
to order any movie on demand,

01:23.960 --> 01:25.121
adult or otherwise.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.611
Yes.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.887
Okay, has anything that I've
just said confused you?

01:28.960 --> 01:31.201
- Yes.
- God damn it!

01:31.920 --> 01:34.730
Jesus, Cher.
Are you bringing your whole closet?

01:34.800 --> 01:38.282
I'm a pro, Dinesh. I
won't apologize for it.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.931
I dress according to the moods
that I sense in the room.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.480
As such, I must have options.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.369
We all packed and ready to go?

01:45.720 --> 01:48.690
We can take my car
but gas is on the company.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.480
Hello? Did everyone leave?

01:52.560 --> 01:53.971
No.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.963
What? Oh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

02:07.760 --> 02:09.568
I don't know
how you read your screen in the car.

02:09.639 --> 02:11.005
It makes me sick as a dog.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.844
I'm okay
as long as I don't think about it.

02:12.920 --> 02:14.490
Besides, the presentation is tomorrow.

02:14.560 --> 02:17.689
So if you just don't think
about it, it really doesn't bother you

02:17.760 --> 02:19.680
to be staring at the screen
when the car's moving

02:19.720 --> 02:22.564
- and turning and you're all queasy...
- Oh, God!

02:22.640 --> 02:24.244
Gilfoyle.

02:24.320 --> 02:27.164
See, I knew it bothered you.
Fucking liar.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.800
So I'm a little behind,
being stuck on that island for four days,

02:40.880 --> 02:43.008
but I think I'm on top of everything.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.765
Okay, uh, give me your IDs
and I'll go register us...

02:45.840 --> 02:48.411
There you are.
Got your credentials and wristbands

02:48.520 --> 02:50.727
for the walk through at 4:00 today.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.165
Uh, walk through?

02:52.240 --> 02:54.441
Yeah, basically,
it's a sound check for the competition.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.449
Uh, yeah, we didn't know about that.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.649
Did I not tell you about the walk through?

02:59.320 --> 03:01.209
I am so sorry.

03:01.280 --> 03:03.009
Uh, that's why I'm here. Peter's on safari

03:03.120 --> 03:05.327
with Lorne Michaels and Kanye West
until next week

03:05.400 --> 03:07.323
so, I can put all of my
attention on you guys for once.

03:07.400 --> 03:11.644
I am so sorry. I thought that I talked
to you guys about the walk...

03:21.920 --> 03:24.491
Gentlemen, welcome to the big show.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.126
TechCrunch motherfucking Disrupt.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.922
Okay, guys,
this place is a vortex of distraction.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.321
Normally the tech world is 2% women.

03:33.440 --> 03:36.762
Guys, these next three days, 15%.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.729
It's a goddamn meat market.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.325
I need you to focus.

03:40.440 --> 03:43.569
How we do here is the entire future
of your company.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.404
Don't screw it all up now.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.086
We have to knock them dead
in the preliminaries tomorrow

03:48.160 --> 03:50.128
so we can move on to the finals on Friday.

03:50.200 --> 03:54.524
I have a question. The program says
that Dan Melcher is judging our round.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.329
Is there any way to get him removed?

03:56.480 --> 03:58.562
Not unless there's a conflict of interest.

03:58.640 --> 04:02.008
Well, there may be. I did have
sexual intercourse with his wife.

04:04.080 --> 04:06.003
What? It was three years ago.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.367
So one of the guys judging us
wants to fucking kill you?

04:08.600 --> 04:10.602
Maybe. I don't know if he found out.

04:10.680 --> 04:13.968
Either way, Richard, you may have to
present instead of me so be prepared.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.440
What, me? Present? No.

04:16.519 --> 04:19.125
We may be fine. We may be totally fine.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.521
We also may be totally fucked.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.090
I'll let you know either way.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.841
I'm gonna go network. Don't approach me.

04:26.400 --> 04:30.121
I don't want to present.
Besides, I'm not even done with the demo.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.522
Okay, Richard, you need to go
to the hotel right now and finish.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.811
- You already checked us into the hotel?
- Yeah. Yeah.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.684
Okay, uh,
I'm gonna do this module by module.

04:38.760 --> 04:43.084
Dinesh, you built the edge video player
so I'm gonna start with you first, okay?

04:43.160 --> 04:45.606
Okay, you guys set up the booth, okay?

04:45.720 --> 04:47.802
Um, I think it's this way.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.086
You think?

04:52.880 --> 04:54.609
A few flyers, that's all we have?

04:54.680 --> 04:56.921
Yeah, I think it is.

04:57.320 --> 04:59.243
<i>Hello, what's your name?</i>

04:59.360 --> 05:01.488
<i>Visit us at microdrone.com...</i>

05:01.560 --> 05:05.724
Oh, wow, Microdrone. They just
closed $17 million in seed funding.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.641
Hi. Hello. Excuse me.

05:10.720 --> 05:14.167
Pied Piper? You guys are competing
in the Startup Battlefield, right?

05:14.240 --> 05:15.890
Everyone has been talking
about your compression rate.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.446
I mean, it is supposed to be sick.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.726
Yeah.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.842
Anyway, you must be great with Java

05:21.920 --> 05:25.242
and I just cannot seem
to figure out this stupid bug. Do you mind?

05:26.280 --> 05:27.725
I'll be back.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.370
Thank you.

05:30.440 --> 05:33.842
If we integrate one module every two hours
we should be in great shape...

05:33.920 --> 05:36.571
Richard, follow me.
Follow me. Follow me.

05:36.640 --> 05:40.440
- All right. See you at the hotel.
- See you.

05:40.520 --> 05:41.760
Very soon, I hope.

05:43.840 --> 05:46.491
Hey, man. Just wanted to say good luck.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.924
Okay, thanks. But what's with all the...

05:50.000 --> 05:52.526
Sorry. I just can't be seen talking to you,
you know?

05:52.600 --> 05:54.329
Hooli people all over the place.

05:54.400 --> 05:58.450
I don't know, man, I'm just really into
this whole rest and vest life, you know,

05:58.520 --> 06:00.284
- way more than I thought I would be.
- Mmm.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.044
I just don't want to rock the boat.

06:02.120 --> 06:05.044
Oh, hey, did I tell you?
I'm getting a boat.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.088
- Wow.
- And a boat guy to take care of it.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.924
You have to have a boat guy.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.365
Wow, yeah, you've gotta have a boat guy...

06:10.440 --> 06:11.601
If you have a boat.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.604
Hey, um, you know that girl, right?

06:15.160 --> 06:18.369
Sherry, I think her name was.
She said you guys went to school together.

06:18.480 --> 06:19.811
Uh, okay, yeah.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.167
I saw her at the Valleywag
party last night,

06:22.240 --> 06:25.961
which was crazy, by the way. Dude, there
must've been like 12 girls there.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.685
- Holy shit.
- Nuts.

06:27.760 --> 06:30.889
Anyway, um, she said you guys
went out a couple times

06:30.960 --> 06:34.567
and then, uh, she dumped you
and you became obsessed with her?

06:34.640 --> 06:38.087
What? What? She said I was obsessed?

06:38.160 --> 06:39.924
She said obsessed.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.731
Uh, that's bullshit,
'cause I think we went out two times.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.724
Eh, it was nothing.
So, how could I be obsessed? That's...

06:45.840 --> 06:49.731
No, you're going down!
Nucleus is gonna crush Wide Diaper.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.770
You never should've said no
to my man, Gavin Belson.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.327
Okay.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.044
Seeded quite a few new companies.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.771
Spinder. It's like Tinder
but for spinsters.

07:05.840 --> 07:09.128
Elderly women looking for sex.

07:28.200 --> 07:32.603
There's this girl who's walking around,
saying that I'm obsessed with her.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.684
Now, that just really pisses me off.

07:34.760 --> 07:37.730
That's fascinating.
Let's just forget about it, okay?

07:37.800 --> 07:38.801
Yeah.

07:41.960 --> 07:44.122
I mean it's... it's just
so fucked up, right?

07:44.200 --> 07:45.884
I mean, I barely remember her.

07:45.960 --> 07:49.240
And it's just so insulting to have someone
walking around spreading lies about you.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.443
Right? I wonder who she's working with.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.683
Like I wonder who she's here with
because if she's telling her coworkers,

07:55.760 --> 07:58.331
then that's a whole 'nother
group of people I gotta worry about.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.004
Richard, you don't have
to worry about anything

08:00.080 --> 08:01.650
- except for Pied Piper right now.
- Yeah, I know.

08:01.720 --> 08:04.166
We have less than 24
hours till the preliminaries.

08:04.560 --> 08:08.121
- No one's worrying, that's the thing. Perfect.
- Perfect.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.166
Okay, her.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.600
She used the word "obsessed," Dinesh.

08:15.640 --> 08:18.120
- "Obsessed."
- Richard, I don't care.

08:19.240 --> 08:22.244
Neither do I. That's the entire point.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.281
I'm just gonna check her
lnstagram real quick.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.522
Because if she's posting
comments about me being obsessed...

08:29.600 --> 08:31.720
I mean, I can't just ignore that.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.330
Would you be interested in a device
that links to your smartphone

08:38.400 --> 08:41.244
and lets you know, even before it happens,
whether you're having a panic attack

08:41.320 --> 08:42.684
- or a heart attack?
- Yeah, yeah.

08:42.760 --> 08:44.284
Okay, here's how Panic-a-Tech works.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.567
You wear this on your finger all day
and it tracks your vitals.

08:46.640 --> 08:50.122
Or if that's too embarrassing,
there's also a Bluetooth suppository

08:50.200 --> 08:53.886
and that goes right where you think it
goes. And that comes with a retrieval kit.

08:53.960 --> 08:57.248
Was he like, "Bro, you're my bro,"

08:57.840 --> 09:01.970
or was he like, "I wanna shoot you in the face
and watch you bleed out all over the stage"

09:02.040 --> 09:04.361
"'cause you fucked my wife, you cocksuck?"

09:04.680 --> 09:06.284
Right in the middle. It was like...

09:08.760 --> 09:09.886
Huh.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.924
What happened? How's it going at the hotel?

09:12.000 --> 09:16.085
Weird. He switched to meta-data extraction
and now wants to see you.

09:16.200 --> 09:20.091
Meta-data? Already? Makes no sense.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.685
He seems very distracted.

09:23.760 --> 09:27.924
Okay, guys, urn, since we're kind of
playing from behind here

09:28.000 --> 09:30.401
I put together a little secret weapon.

09:30.680 --> 09:34.082
I, um... I went through the entire list
of conference participants

09:34.160 --> 09:37.130
and I found images and I found bios
and I printed them out

09:37.200 --> 09:38.326
so we have them all in one place.

09:38.400 --> 09:41.131
- Why did you do that?
- Uh, okay.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.851
Who's this guy? Watch. He is...

09:46.120 --> 09:49.249
Rick Smith, co-founder
of Crosscut Ventures.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.446
How did you...

09:50.520 --> 09:54.286
ID-Keen. It's this facial recognition app
that Monica put on our phones.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.249
You just point it at anybody,
tells you who they are

09:56.320 --> 09:58.129
and how important they
are to the conference.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.126
You're not showing up at all.

10:03.200 --> 10:07.046
Yeah, maybe I'm not getting a...
No, I'm getting a signal.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.527
Okay. Um, well...

10:12.040 --> 10:15.283
Ooh, Jared, Jared, uh,
recycling's over there.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.966
Hey, so what's the deal?
Does the judge know or not?

10:18.040 --> 10:19.883
I don't know, Monica. He's toying with me.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.964
Or maybe he's not.
I can't fucking figure it out.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.930
Erlich, you need to stop this.
His wife is here.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.207
Grow a pair and talk to
her, find out for sure.

10:29.280 --> 10:32.170
Why don't you grow a pair
and I'll talk to her?

10:32.480 --> 10:33.481
Hmm.

10:33.720 --> 10:34.881
What?

10:36.200 --> 10:37.565
Hey-

10:42.040 --> 10:43.485
Do you happen to know Java?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.287
Are you kidding? It's like my specialty.

10:46.360 --> 10:47.725
Will you help me?

10:49.560 --> 10:52.131
Oh, it would be my honor.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.240
Yes?

11:12.320 --> 11:15.449
Oh, sorry. Um, I must not
have the right room.

11:15.520 --> 11:18.364
- I'm looking for Dan Melcher.
- Yeah, that's us.

11:18.440 --> 11:19.965
Oh, it is? Okay.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.929
I was looking to speak with his wife.

11:22.320 --> 11:26.723
That's me. I'm, well, his new
wife, we just got married.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.404
Oh, congratulations.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.606
Uh, what happened with Madelyn?

11:32.320 --> 11:34.527
- You're a friend of Dan's?
- Yeah.

11:34.600 --> 11:37.001
We've... We have a common interest...

11:37.080 --> 11:39.287
- Uh, many common interests.
- Yeah.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.964
Well, she was a nightmare.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.887
Pills, in and out of rehab.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.885
Had all of these disgusting affairs.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.564
You know, the divorce nearly killed Dan.

11:48.640 --> 11:51.371
Really? Disgusting affairs.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.483
Well, I... I feel terrible.

11:54.560 --> 11:57.245
No, it's fine. He's put it behind him.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.211
All Of it?

11:59.320 --> 12:01.322
- I mean, every aspect of it?
- Mmm-hmm.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.531
Well, that is... That is great to hear.

12:05.640 --> 12:08.086
What if she's spreading this lie
to everyone at this conference?

12:08.160 --> 12:09.525
I mean, honestly, Gilfoyle...

12:09.600 --> 12:13.924
Richard, stop talking about this
or I have to punch you in the face.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.482
Fuck. <i>it</i> is huge.

12:19.160 --> 12:21.561
- Uh...
"Very, very huge."

12:21.640 --> 12:25.690
<i>Check, one-two, two,
tsetse fly, tsetse fly.</i>

12:25.760 --> 12:27.250
Hey, how's the demo coming?

12:27.320 --> 12:29.482
Um, we're getting there.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.090
Uh, definitely... Getting there.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.808
Gentlemen, I bring good tidings.

12:33.880 --> 12:38.090
Turns out that Melcher
is divorced, remarried

12:38.160 --> 12:41.562
and has put the previous relationship
behind him completely.

12:41.640 --> 12:42.846
Problem solved.

12:42.920 --> 12:44.285
That's great.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.410
It sure is, Richard, it sure as hell is.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.085
Look at these poor fuckers. They don't
even know what's about to hit 'em.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.289
The hammer of God.

12:55.680 --> 12:59.048
I am so sorry! I am so sorry.
I thought you guys were gonna come get me

12:59.120 --> 13:00.963
and... And I'm sorry.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.407
- Wait, Jared, what are you doing here?
- What?

13:03.480 --> 13:04.527
- Who's watching the booth?
- Yeah.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.807
- I thought that maybe Monica could...
- Ooh.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.645
She's not in the company.
We need her here. That's the thing.

13:09.720 --> 13:12.451
All right, everybody, uh, this run-through
is for essential personnel only,

13:12.560 --> 13:13.925
essential only.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.161
Oh.

13:17.240 --> 13:20.130
- We need someone in the booth is the thing.
- Right.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.645
You're essential to the booth.

13:21.720 --> 13:22.846
Right.

13:23.880 --> 13:27.043
All right, each team will have
six minutes for presentation and demo,

13:27.160 --> 13:28.685
at which point the judges
will ask a few questions...

13:28.760 --> 13:30.808
Uh, do you mind if I break in here,
just one question.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.531
Uh, are the judges allowed
to send us through

13:33.600 --> 13:35.967
to the finals immediately after we present

13:36.040 --> 13:41.126
or do we have to wait
until everyone else has gone?

13:41.200 --> 13:44.090
Well, I'm just saying
what everybody's thinking.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.842
<i>Hello, what's your name?</i>

13:49.920 --> 13:51.888
<i>Visit us at microdrone.com to download...</i>

13:51.960 --> 13:54.804
- Uh, excuse me, no thank you.
- ...a free <i>video</i> of you

13:54.880 --> 13:56.882
<i>- at TechCrunch Disrupt.
- Uh, no</i> thank you.

13:56.960 --> 14:01.363
<i>Nathan. Are you Nathan Zimmerman,
CEO of Flingual?</i>

14:01.440 --> 14:03.727
I... I... Whoever's doing
this, no thank you.

14:03.840 --> 14:06.684
Yeah, I think we got a dead zone,
an audio dead zone right here.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.285
Listen to this.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.609
Hear that? Compared to...

14:10.920 --> 14:12.968
Okay, here's what I want,
as soon as the music comes up...

14:13.080 --> 14:14.080
Music?

14:14.120 --> 14:16.885
I want you to hit me with a
spotlight, barn! And a hard spot.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.162
Better yet, do you have
those spotlights that...

14:19.240 --> 14:20.730
...come up from the ground,

14:20.800 --> 14:22.040
like in Pride Fighting.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.120
I can check.

14:23.160 --> 14:26.130
Okay, so two of those, one on each side
and then one in the center

14:26.200 --> 14:30.728
so that it casts my shadow behind me,
like a giant looking over his own shoulder.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.529
Do you have any wind machines.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.051
I'm gonna need two of those...

14:34.120 --> 14:35.645
Are you humming to yourself?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.480
Was I?

14:38.880 --> 14:39.927
Uh...

14:40.000 --> 14:43.800
You know, honestly,
I may have found the perfect woman.

14:43.880 --> 14:46.008
Whoa. What? Who? Who?

14:46.080 --> 14:47.844
She's in the booth right
next to us, Charlotte.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.400
She's not even physically my type,
she has blonde hair

14:50.480 --> 14:53.848
and these stupid pink streaks
that doesn't seem to be dominant at all.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.491
However, I think I'm in love.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.450
Whoa!

14:58.520 --> 15:02.047
She invited me to her room
to watch <i>Cloud Atlas</i> later tonight.

15:02.120 --> 15:04.327
Oh, yeah,
that means she wants you to lay her.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.084
Is that definitive?

15:06.160 --> 15:08.481
I mean, nobody can watch more
than like a minute of that film.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.722
So what's the deal? I mean, is she hot?

15:10.800 --> 15:12.211
Yeah, I mean, she's attractive,

15:12.280 --> 15:15.568
but almost every woman is attractive.
It was her mind.

15:16.160 --> 15:20.563
She wrote this Java method that was the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.324
Elegant, tight.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.890
There's just something so hot
about a woman that can code like that.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.530
You know, I just want to

15:27.600 --> 15:30.490
crawl in her frontal lobe and...

15:30.560 --> 15:31.846
What's up?

15:32.560 --> 15:34.642
You know I wrote that code, right?

15:34.720 --> 15:37.291
No, this code was on her system.

15:37.360 --> 15:41.126
A banged up 15-inch MacBook Pro
with shitty stickers on it?

15:41.200 --> 15:43.885
Everyone here has a beat up
15-inch MacBook Pro...

15:43.960 --> 15:46.327
With a 1.3 chip and only two gigs of RAM?

15:46.400 --> 15:49.802
She doesn't know Java. I wrote that code.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.531
- You said you were in love with her mind.
- Oh, fuck.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.848
You realize what's going on, right?

15:55.920 --> 15:59.208
It's not her you're sexually attracted to,
it's my code.

15:59.280 --> 16:02.762
Shut the... That is the most
disgusting fucking thing I've ever heard.

16:02.840 --> 16:06.401
Just face it, Dinesh,
you're gay for my code, you're code gay.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.882
No! No, I'm into her.
Her, okay? Fuck your code!

16:09.960 --> 16:11.644
You'd like to fuck my code, wouldn't you?

16:11.720 --> 16:14.485
Hey, would you like to masturbate
to the subroutine I just wrote?

16:14.560 --> 16:16.881
No! It's... I'm... I'm...

16:16.960 --> 16:19.406
And then I'll sort of close
right here in the center

16:19.480 --> 16:21.482
with a confidence and poise that, well,

16:21.560 --> 16:24.723
they probably won't have seen
up until this point.

16:24.800 --> 16:28.600
And then at that point we've got some photos
that we're gonna throw up on the big screen.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.160
- Photos?
- Yeah, you know, just a few.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.971
Gandhi, MLK, me as an inquisitive child.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.565
Richard, could you please?

16:35.680 --> 16:37.921
Oh, yes, sorry. I'll just plug it in here.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.805
No! Don't!

16:41.880 --> 16:43.370
- Don't!
- Oh, shit...

16:43.480 --> 16:45.562
- Oh, what the fuck?
- Shit.

16:45.640 --> 16:46.721
Oh, she's here.

16:46.800 --> 16:47.847
Mmm.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.484
Oh, shit, it's frozen. It's frozen.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.403
That is not me, obviously.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.245
He's obsessed with me. I'm sorry.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.402
Hey, what's wrong?

17:11.720 --> 17:14.803
I'm just a little nervous
'cause you're so beautiful.

17:16.319 --> 17:17.367
Oh?

17:17.440 --> 17:18.930
Random question...

17:19.480 --> 17:21.881
So you didn't write any of that Java code?

17:22.440 --> 17:23.441
Uh-uh.

17:23.640 --> 17:26.803
But I write all of our tweets and we
have like a couple hundred followers.

17:27.119 --> 17:29.122
Couple hundred's pretty.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.891
Oh, let me move this.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.330
Oh, that's the code your, uh, friend wrote.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.920
- Yeah, it is.
- It's really good, huh?

17:45.400 --> 17:48.609
It's fine. I don't care about it.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.490
Mmm, there we go.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.006
On, fuck.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.611
Come on, focus, focus.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.250
Richard's not gonna finish, is he?

18:23.320 --> 18:25.561
He'll finish, Gilfoyle, he has to.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.205
Are you okay?

18:29.800 --> 18:31.211
Yeah, I'm fine.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.170
I knew it. You couldn't do it.

18:35.560 --> 18:39.121
Please shut up. Shut up.

18:39.200 --> 18:43.205
Why is it that every time
I'm about to have sex with a lady,

18:44.040 --> 18:45.804
he's all up in there somehow?

18:45.880 --> 18:49.202
Finally, just us.
Guys, this round is on me.

18:49.280 --> 18:52.045
Hey, Jared. There you guys go.

18:52.360 --> 18:54.886
- To Pied Piper. Hmm?
- To Pied Piper.

18:54.960 --> 18:56.405
Hear, hear.

18:57.760 --> 19:00.525
Yeah, drink it up.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.568
- Mmm.
- But it's not gonna change who you are.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.770
Monica, can I speak to you for a minute?

19:05.840 --> 19:07.171
Yeah.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.409
- No, Sherry, it has to be now!
- Oh, shit.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.284
Okay, look, we need to talk.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.169
You keep telling people
I'm obsessed with you.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.890
Richard, why don't you
just take a step back...

19:15.960 --> 19:18.201
It's not true... No, no, no, let me finish.

19:18.280 --> 19:22.683
Okay, did I put your picture up on the
big screen in the auditorium? Yes.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.720
But that's because
I was showing you to my friends

19:24.760 --> 19:27.001
to prove a point that
I'm not obsessed with you.

19:27.080 --> 19:31.324
- Richard, I'm gonna go now.
- No, I'm not obsessed with you, Sherry!

19:31.440 --> 19:32.930
I'm...

19:34.280 --> 19:35.566
I'm not.

19:36.480 --> 19:40.326
That guy Richard I was telling you about
just totally freaked out on me.

19:40.400 --> 19:41.686
Yeah, the obsessed guy.

19:41.760 --> 19:43.364
- Where are you?
- You've been doing this ever since

19:43.440 --> 19:44.805
- we arrived at the conference.
- Which elevators?

19:44.880 --> 19:48.851
You really think that you can come between
me and Richard Hendricks?

19:48.920 --> 19:52.367
We're partners, okay,
and I've devoted every second

19:52.440 --> 19:55.728
of my waking life for the past
two months to him, okay?

19:55.840 --> 20:00.004
I am devoted to him and to the precious
thing that we're building together!

20:00.080 --> 20:02.924
I'm his partner. I can
tell when he's vomiting...

20:03.000 --> 20:04.206
- Uh, what? No.
Because he's nervous...

20:04.280 --> 20:06.726
- Never mind, Kate, I'm fine.
- ...or when he's vomiting because he's sick

20:06.800 --> 20:09.087
or when he's vomiting
because he had cilantro, which he loves

20:09.160 --> 20:11.049
but he shouldn't have
because it makes him...

20:11.120 --> 20:15.921
I had no idea that you felt this way.
I mean it, I am so sorry.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.401
I mean, I'm obsessed with her...

20:18.480 --> 20:21.723
Richard, can I talk to you for a second?

20:24.080 --> 20:25.445
Uh, okay.

20:29.840 --> 20:32.730
I owe you an apology. I was way off base.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.723
Well, yeah, you were.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.885
He cleared it all up for me.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.645
- Jared? Really?
- Yeah. He's your partner, right?

20:40.160 --> 20:43.130
Yeah, he is. One of many.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.890
Probably too many.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.164
How could I not have seen this?

20:47.480 --> 20:50.051
Obviously you're not obsessed with me.

20:50.560 --> 20:54.610
Richard, it's none of my business,
but be safe.

20:54.680 --> 20:57.809
- Okay?
- Okay.

20:59.320 --> 21:03.291
Of course I'm safe. I backup my
whole system like five times a day.

21:03.480 --> 21:07.166
So... Uh, Jared, hey,

21:07.600 --> 21:08.965
thank you.

21:09.240 --> 21:12.164
- For what?
- Uh, you know, everything.

21:12.240 --> 21:16.165
I feel like we don't appreciate you enough,
so thank you.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.283
Are you... Are you crying?

21:22.680 --> 21:25.809
Uh, don't do that. Don't cry.

21:29.160 --> 21:33.449
Oh, shit. I gotta get back to work.
I... I need to focus here.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.766
We should all go.

21:34.840 --> 21:36.763
All right, I'm taking care of this one.

21:36.840 --> 21:39.969
But when we win this fuckin' thing,
Richard, you're buying the next round.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.121
Yeah.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.485
Oh, no.

21:45.840 --> 21:49.322
We're with the conference,
is there any sort of discount?

21:49.400 --> 21:51.402
- Kind of break you can...
- Mmm-mmm.

21:51.480 --> 21:53.528
No. All right.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.171
- Hello, again.
- Oh, hi.

21:56.240 --> 22:00.086
You know, that was really sweet of you
to be so concerned about Dan.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.571
He really has been through hell.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.241
Well, it's the least I could do.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.244
So how did you know Madelyn again?

22:07.320 --> 22:10.369
Oh, uh, long story.

22:10.440 --> 22:11.930
Yeah?

22:12.400 --> 22:15.882
I have to admit, I'm curious.

22:18.440 --> 22:20.602
You know what, keep it open.

22:24.080 --> 22:26.048
Have you ever cared too much?

22:30.800 --> 22:33.849
<i>People, are you ready?</i>

22:33.920 --> 22:37.970
<i>Are you ready
for the ultimate tech startup competition?</i>

22:38.040 --> 22:39.610
<i>Let me hear it.</i>

22:39.680 --> 22:41.808
<i>Disrupt!</i>

22:42.120 --> 22:43.485
Disrupt.

on your mobile platform.</i>

22:57.960 --> 23:02.488
<i>Happin! will revolutionize location-based
mobile news aggregation as you know it.</i>

23:02.640 --> 23:06.201
<i>We're making the world a better place,
through Paxos algorithms</i>

23:06.320 --> 23:07.731
<i>for consensus protocols.</i>

23:07.800 --> 23:09.529
<i>And we're making the world a better place</i>

23:09.600 --> 23:12.490
<i>through software-defined data centers
for cloud computing.</i>

23:12.560 --> 23:16.963
<i>A better place through canonical data
models to communicate between endpoints.</i>

23:17.080 --> 23:19.082
<i>A better place through scalable,</i>

23:19.160 --> 23:22.369
<i>fault-tolerant distributed databases
with ACID transactions.</i>

23:22.440 --> 23:25.011
<i>And we are truly local mobile social.</i>

23:25.080 --> 23:27.686
<i>And we're completely So-Mo-Lo.</i>

23:27.800 --> 23:29.006
<i>And</i> we're Mo-Lo-So.

23:29.080 --> 23:30.889
<i>We're Lo-Mo-So, bro.</i>

23:30.960 --> 23:34.601
We were So-Lo-Mo but now we're Mo-Lo-So.

23:34.680 --> 23:37.650
<i>No, Mo-So-Lo. No...</i>

23:40.640 --> 23:41.926
You want me to get
a water or something?

23:42.000 --> 23:43.923
- Yeah, drink this.
- Here.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.364
- So we're all good?
- We're all great.

23:47.440 --> 23:50.603
I killed it.
Our Weissman score on all tests, 2.89.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.444
Right at the theoretical limit.

23:52.520 --> 23:54.443
Yeah, all the edge modules are humming.

23:54.520 --> 23:57.364
Uh, even on mobile.
They can throw anything at us.

23:57.440 --> 24:01.968
Great. Well, good luck.
I'm gonna go find my seat.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.690
Um, except 3D video.

24:04.680 --> 24:05.886
What?

24:05.960 --> 24:07.883
3D video's still a little hinky.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.440
Erlich better steer them away
from that just to be safe.

24:10.520 --> 24:12.045
Where the hell is Erlich?

24:13.400 --> 24:15.084
He wasn't with you guys this morning?

24:15.160 --> 24:17.447
<i>Rather than heating an entire room,</i>

24:17.600 --> 24:20.285
<i>HumanHeater is a microwave technology</i>

24:20.360 --> 24:23.569
<i>that can heat the surface
of a person's skin instead,</i>

24:23.720 --> 24:26.291
<i>potentially saving
millions in heating costs</i>

24:26.400 --> 24:31.042
<i>and helping the environment,
thereby making the world a better place.</i>

24:31.400 --> 24:32.890
<i>Judges.</i>

24:34.440 --> 24:35.487
<i>Uh...</i>

24:35.560 --> 24:37.403
<i>Okay, so,</i>

24:37.480 --> 24:43.044
<i>you want to heat people with microwaves,
is that right?</i>

24:43.120 --> 24:44.770
<i>That can't be safe.</i>

24:44.840 --> 24:48.526
<i>That's a great question
and trust me, it is very, very safe.</i>

24:48.600 --> 24:51.171
<i>I've been working on it for 15 years.</i>

24:51.240 --> 24:54.164
<i>I don't trust you and it can't be safe.</i>

24:54.240 --> 24:57.926
<i>And even if it was, I don't think
you could ever sell the public on this.</i>

24:58.400 --> 24:59.970
<i>Thank you.</i>

25:00.720 --> 25:03.849
<i>I think when people
see the savings on their utility bill</i>

25:03.920 --> 25:07.402
<i>and when they see how it saves
the environment, they will be sold.</i>

25:07.480 --> 25:09.687
<i>Microwaves? Are you kidding me?</i>

25:10.040 --> 25:12.566
Man, they are brutal.

25:12.640 --> 25:15.530
All right, let's light this candle.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.204
Where the hell have you been?

25:17.280 --> 25:20.762
Uh, there's been some developments.
You know how I fucked Melcher's old wife?

25:20.840 --> 25:22.842
- I fucked his new wife, too.
- What?

25:22.920 --> 25:24.729
Uh, don't worry,
he's not gonna find out.

25:24.800 --> 25:27.081
I left way before he got back
last night and then I didn't

25:27.120 --> 25:29.327
go back this morning until 20 minutes
after he had left.

25:29.400 --> 25:30.686
You went back?

25:30.760 --> 25:33.889
- How many times did you fuck this woman?
- The old wife or the new wife?

25:34.120 --> 25:35.963
- The new wife.
- Last night or this morning?

25:36.040 --> 25:38.930
Erlich, what were you thinking?
This is kind of a big day today.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.048
Relax, he's not gonna find out.
She's not gonna tell him.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.087
How the fuck do you know that?

25:42.160 --> 25:45.721
Because she'd have to be crazy to tell him
and I asked her point blank if she was crazy

25:45.800 --> 25:48.007
and she swore to me, no, she's not crazy.

25:48.440 --> 25:50.647
- Pied Piper, you're up.
- Let's do it.

25:50.720 --> 25:54.406
<i>The microwaves only penetrate
the top layer of skin cells.</i>

25:54.480 --> 25:57.211
<i>I don't believe you. It can't be safe.</i>

25:57.280 --> 25:58.406
<i>Thank you.</i>

25:59.160 --> 26:02.846
<i>I've been testing it
on these guys all winter and they're fine.</i>

26:02.920 --> 26:05.287
<i>Let me just demonstrate it to assure you...</i>

26:05.360 --> 26:07.362
<i>- No! No!
- No! Please!</i>

26:08.360 --> 26:11.887
<i>No one is ever going to buy one of these.</i>

26:11.960 --> 26:13.246
<i>Ever.</i>

26:13.320 --> 26:15.527
<i>That was HumanHeater.</i>

26:15.600 --> 26:18.285
<i>Next up, Executive Chairman
and Chief Visionary</i>

26:18.360 --> 26:22.251
<i>- Erlich Bachman presenting Pied Piper.</i>

26:36.360 --> 26:38.442
<i>Since the dawn of time,</i>

26:38.520 --> 26:43.128
<i>mankind hath sought
to make things smaller, but until now,</i>

26:43.200 --> 26:45.202
no man...

26:45.280 --> 26:47.203
You son of a bitch!

26:47.280 --> 26:49.601
<i>Jesus Christ! Everyone, remain calm.</i>

26:49.680 --> 26:52.365
<i>Stay in your seats!
Everything is under control!</i>

26:52.440 --> 26:55.011
Lights?

26:55.520 --> 26:56.806
I think he knows.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.370
Security to main stage.
