00:33.808 --> 00:37.205
<i>There is magic in the air...</i>

00:37.207 --> 00:42.205
<i>the earth and in water.</i>

00:42.207 --> 00:46.671
<i>but this ancient power has been
forgotten by many in these lands.</i>

00:46.673 --> 00:52.108
<i>and the Celtic people are no
longer under its protection.</i>

01:00.607 --> 01:03.171
<i>Saxon hordes slaughter
the brave Celts...</i>

01:03.173 --> 01:08.472
<i>but it is not only this Saxon
enemy that defeats them.</i>

01:08.474 --> 01:12.105
<i>For treachery lurks at the
heart of their resistance.</i>

01:24.806 --> 01:28.071
<i>Yet... there is hope.</i>

01:43.440 --> 01:45.204
He is healthy, I hope.

01:45.206 --> 01:48.975
He is everything I was told he would be.

01:50.674 --> 01:51.905
How can this be?

01:51.907 --> 01:57.205
A mark of the Tuadaan... the divine race.

01:57.207 --> 02:03.070
A gift from them, nothing more.

02:03.072 --> 02:04.838
Nothing to fear.

02:04.840 --> 02:08.170
Will you now reveal the father?

02:08.173 --> 02:12.672
I have told you... he has none.

02:12.674 --> 02:18.605
He came to me as his name
did... in a dream full of hope...

02:18.607 --> 02:22.838
And what is this name?

02:22.840 --> 02:26.805
His name... is Myrrdin.

02:41.940 --> 02:45.073
Do it again, Myrrdin... make it grow!

02:54.839 --> 02:56.138
How'd you do it?

02:56.140 --> 03:01.771
I do not know, it just... happens.

03:01.773 --> 03:04.905
Mother says it must be a
secret. Do you swear not to tell?

03:04.907 --> 03:08.004
I swear, not even my own mother.

03:08.006 --> 03:09.740
Come on, then!

03:18.972 --> 03:21.104
You would not strike a lady.

03:21.106 --> 03:23.841
The gods of the wind on my side.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.771
What have I told you?

03:47.773 --> 03:50.070
Come away from the forest.

03:50.072 --> 03:52.173
Make haste.

03:58.940 --> 04:01.038
Why is Wynar Forest forbidden?

04:01.040 --> 04:04.504
Because it is held
sacred... for the Tuadaan.

04:04.506 --> 04:06.938
No man is permitted to enter.

04:06.940 --> 04:11.037
The forest will not
let him in or out alive.

04:11.039 --> 04:14.704
Tell me about the Tuadaan again.

04:14.706 --> 04:16.837
Well, long ago, the gods of light...

04:16.839 --> 04:19.904
and the gods of darkness
fought a fierce war.

04:19.906 --> 04:24.104
The battles took place in the
world of men, in these lands...

04:24.106 --> 04:28.704
perhaps on the very
ground we walk upon now.

04:28.706 --> 04:31.205
- A divine race of people.
- Tuadaan.

04:31.207 --> 04:32.703
Ssh.

04:32.705 --> 04:36.472
The Tuadaan fought
alongside the gods of light.

04:36.474 --> 04:39.137
The Tuadaan drove the dark
gods into the underworld...

04:39.139 --> 04:40.738
and made these lands safe.

04:40.740 --> 04:44.038
But the fight will never be done.

04:44.040 --> 04:49.874
The battle between light and darkness
continues in the underworld to this very day.

05:00.939 --> 05:06.038
You, Myrrdin, you carry
the mark of the Tuadaan.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.004
They left this world to save us.

05:09.006 --> 05:12.603
So you must never forget
how precious life is.

05:12.605 --> 05:16.770
It is your special responsibility.

05:28.140 --> 05:30.004
- What is this?
- It's the king.

05:30.006 --> 05:31.838
He's responded to our calls for help.

05:31.840 --> 05:36.007
He sent an envoy to hear
us... and his powerful druid.

05:38.807 --> 05:41.438
Nia, you must go to your mother.

05:41.440 --> 05:42.938
Wait!

05:49.806 --> 05:54.671
Myrrdin, you must go home
and wait until I return.

05:54.673 --> 05:56.171
I promise one day you will understand.

05:56.173 --> 06:00.073
But now you must go... now! Go!

06:29.605 --> 06:32.537
Your crops failed...

06:32.539 --> 06:35.871
so you beg for the king's help.

06:35.873 --> 06:41.538
And yet... you do not help yourselves.

06:41.540 --> 06:47.038
Where is your altar? Where
are your sacred stones?

06:47.040 --> 06:50.538
From where do you worship?

06:50.540 --> 06:53.937
You have forgotten the old ways.

06:53.939 --> 06:56.737
You have failed your gods.

06:56.739 --> 06:59.604
This is why you pay the price.

06:59.606 --> 07:05.171
Starvation is a light punishment
for your lack of faith.

07:05.173 --> 07:07.437
We follow the gods, my druid.

07:07.439 --> 07:11.938
You must appease your gods.

07:11.940 --> 07:15.937
And only one thing will satisfy them now...

07:15.939 --> 07:18.172
sacrifice.

07:22.540 --> 07:28.707
Human sacrifice, one of you owe.

07:32.107 --> 07:34.437
But all life is precious!

07:34.439 --> 07:36.973
Who speaks?

07:38.140 --> 07:42.438
<i>All...</i> all life is precious.

07:42.440 --> 07:44.604
That is what the Tuadaan taught us.

07:44.606 --> 07:46.970
The Tuadaan?

07:46.972 --> 07:52.570
You speak of nothing but a dead race.

07:52.572 --> 07:55.104
Would you follow their teachings over mine?

07:55.106 --> 07:57.904
Of course he will not, my druid.

07:57.906 --> 08:02.671
The boy merely speaks out of turn.

08:02.673 --> 08:05.206
Come here, child.

08:08.139 --> 08:11.470
Do not fear me.

08:11.472 --> 08:12.906
Come.

08:23.173 --> 08:28.171
No! Myrrdin! Myrrdin, no!

08:28.173 --> 08:30.172
What's this?

08:30.174 --> 08:34.870
It is a mark... of the Tuadaan.

08:34.871 --> 08:37.871
Who branded you, son? Tell me now!

08:37.873 --> 08:41.905
We don't brand children
here! He was born with it.

08:41.907 --> 08:44.006
He's been branded with it!

08:45.939 --> 08:49.704
There are those among you
who would worship the Tuadaan.

08:49.706 --> 08:51.070
Myrrdin!

08:51.072 --> 08:53.638
This is the rot that keeps
you from your true gods!

08:53.640 --> 08:55.172
No! Myrrdin!

08:55.174 --> 08:58.204
Well, you shall learn the folly of this.

08:58.206 --> 09:01.171
We have your sacrifice!

09:01.173 --> 09:05.171
No, you don't understand, please, please!

09:05.173 --> 09:07.204
- Please!
- You cannot...

09:07.206 --> 09:10.104
understand! Please! He's only a child.

09:10.106 --> 09:15.503
Your father may be a chieftain, but you
are still a bastard son, nothing more!

09:15.505 --> 09:19.470
Cross the king's druid
again and I will butcher you.

09:19.472 --> 09:22.071
Please, not him! Please!

09:22.073 --> 09:24.637
You cannot escape your destiny, boy.

09:24.639 --> 09:26.171
Myrrdin!

09:26.173 --> 09:30.073
- Let me perform the sacrifice.
- No, Myrrdin!

09:32.040 --> 09:33.503
My druid, I do not trust...

09:33.505 --> 09:35.140
Very well.

09:37.872 --> 09:43.637
You may prove your worth to
me, bastard son of Cornwall.

09:43.639 --> 09:45.373
No!

09:47.006 --> 09:50.737
Myrrdin! No!

09:50.739 --> 09:54.171
You die today so your village may live on.

09:54.173 --> 09:55.807
Please...

09:57.606 --> 10:00.737
Bite my hand.

10:00.739 --> 10:04.670
Bite my hand now!

10:04.672 --> 10:07.970
Agh!

10:37.006 --> 10:39.904
Do you hear your mother, boy?

10:39.906 --> 10:45.437
Give yourself to the gods and save her!

10:45.439 --> 10:51.205
No! No, Myrrdin! No!

10:51.207 --> 10:53.204
No, Myrrdin!

10:53.206 --> 10:55.440
Good boy.

11:23.807 --> 11:25.871
Seize him!

11:44.206 --> 11:46.739
Come here, boy!

11:50.440 --> 11:53.007
Come here!

11:54.940 --> 11:57.105
Get off me!

11:57.107 --> 12:01.106
Stop there, boy! Come here now!

12:12.006 --> 12:14.874
You meant to save him.

12:16.173 --> 12:19.140
Now he's dead anyway.

12:20.506 --> 12:23.374
No one survives Wynar.

14:37.005 --> 14:41.704
Did you feel it, Lucan? He
summoned the elements, that boy.

14:41.706 --> 14:45.437
He would have made a powerful
sacrifice for our cause.

14:45.439 --> 14:49.104
Instead, the forest has taken him.

14:49.106 --> 14:51.637
You should not have let him escape you.

14:51.639 --> 14:56.806
It was Arthfael... he
meant to free the boy.

14:57.972 --> 15:01.603
Let me kill him now, in the boy's stead.

15:01.605 --> 15:07.036
No, no... his father
is a friend to the King.

15:07.038 --> 15:12.670
Arthfael shall pay for what he has
done, but we shall bide our time.

15:12.672 --> 15:18.407
We have more villages to
visit... much work to do.

15:20.206 --> 15:23.837
He wanted so badly to save the boy.

15:23.839 --> 15:27.471
Let us take his mind off this dark memory.

15:27.473 --> 15:28.837
Let's get him drunk.

15:28.839 --> 15:31.837
We can't get him drunk, he's just a boy!

15:31.839 --> 15:34.969
Then he can watch us getting drunk!

15:34.971 --> 15:40.069
Hey, Arthfael! Arthfael!

15:40.071 --> 15:42.006
Arthfael!

15:45.006 --> 15:46.837
A moment, friends.

15:46.839 --> 15:50.839
I'm sure the Saxons will
wait for our brave commander.

16:03.939 --> 16:06.437
Speak quickly, Anyon.
The Saxon forces approach.

16:06.439 --> 16:08.937
Aberthol's men are at it again.
You said to always tell you.

16:08.939 --> 16:10.037
Show me.

16:10.039 --> 16:11.671
But the Saxons... you said...

16:11.673 --> 16:13.907
We're not just fighting the Saxons.

16:31.539 --> 16:33.870
A Christian Celt...

16:33.872 --> 16:36.440
Worse than a Saxon you are!

16:39.138 --> 16:41.936
What's wrong with the old gods then, eh?

16:41.938 --> 16:45.070
Don't you know what happens to heathens?

16:45.072 --> 16:51.206
Aberthol says we're to sacrifice
all Christians soon as we find 'em.

16:54.839 --> 16:59.638
They mean to kill her! But you
cannot challenge Aberthol's men.

16:59.640 --> 17:02.738
The druid has too much power.

17:02.740 --> 17:05.773
We'll go back to camp, yes?

17:10.540 --> 17:11.704
No!

17:11.705 --> 17:14.674
It's my turn. Hold her.

17:18.472 --> 17:20.372
You won't need that!

17:23.472 --> 17:26.804
And yet you need a blade!

17:26.806 --> 17:30.171
If you must be armed, surely she
can have her faith as a shield?

17:30.173 --> 17:33.637
We serve the king's
druid. You cannot meddle!

17:33.639 --> 17:34.937
Return to battle!

17:34.939 --> 17:37.437
Can I not stay and watch
your battle, brothers?

17:37.439 --> 17:39.340
That I may learn from your tactics?

17:40.673 --> 17:42.804
Two men to kill one woman...

17:42.806 --> 17:45.937
unless you count her
unborn child as a combatant.

17:45.939 --> 17:48.837
A fair and even fight after all!

17:48.839 --> 17:51.306
- You mock us.
- I do.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.839
And you are precisely as
intelligent as you appear.

17:59.505 --> 18:02.372
You cannot harm us! We are Aberthol's men!

18:16.206 --> 18:18.273
Aberthol will hear of this!

18:29.138 --> 18:31.969
You are a Christian then?

18:31.971 --> 18:33.670
Yes.

18:33.672 --> 18:36.673
Our king's pagan druid thinks
little of the new faith.

18:38.173 --> 18:39.671
And you?

18:39.673 --> 18:42.004
I think little of all faiths.

18:42.006 --> 18:47.538
Faith places too much emphasis
on death. I value life.

18:47.540 --> 18:51.973
Will you, please... my icon!

20:06.071 --> 20:09.439
No!

20:15.639 --> 20:19.438
The horns! The battle is near!

20:30.671 --> 20:37.470
Our ancestors defeated
the last red dragon...

20:37.472 --> 20:41.036
that plagued our lands.

20:41.038 --> 20:43.737
But they did not kill it.

20:43.739 --> 20:48.603
They tamed it to fight at their side!

20:48.605 --> 20:54.870
With the beast in their
midst, their enemies fell.

20:54.872 --> 20:58.674
And there was no one to challenge them!

20:59.839 --> 21:04.438
No more do we have dragons to defend us...

21:04.440 --> 21:08.937
so we stand alone to fight for our people.

21:08.939 --> 21:15.603
For their survival...
against a savage enemy.

21:15.605 --> 21:20.970
We preserved our way of life
through Roman occupation...

21:20.972 --> 21:26.939
we shall not lose it now
to these new intruders!

21:29.871 --> 21:34.636
So we will fight like dragons!

21:34.638 --> 21:38.570
We will face the enemy head on!

21:38.572 --> 21:41.869
We shall not cower nor hide.

21:41.871 --> 21:44.702
We shall take the fight to them this day.

21:44.704 --> 21:48.936
Attack shall be our defense!

21:48.938 --> 21:52.136
My king, we spoke of
very different tactics.

21:52.138 --> 21:54.004
We spoke of luring them through the valley.

21:54.006 --> 21:55.504
We have spent days planning...

21:55.506 --> 21:59.670
Arthfael, do not question your king.

21:59.672 --> 22:05.438
Rhain of Pembroke commands
the warriors under my standard.

22:05.440 --> 22:10.203
Only he may speak to me of tactics.

22:10.205 --> 22:14.669
Rhain? Where is Rhain?

22:14.671 --> 22:19.203
Rhain fell in battle my
lord... two months passed.

22:19.205 --> 22:22.069
I was given the honor of his duties by you.

22:22.071 --> 22:24.836
You lie! It cannot be! It cannot be!

22:24.838 --> 22:26.103
Your king is tired.

22:26.105 --> 22:28.869
He must conserve his energy for the battle.

22:28.871 --> 22:30.537
You will follow his order.

22:30.539 --> 22:34.637
They outnumber us. We must
follow our tactics as planned.

22:34.639 --> 22:36.036
Open assault is suicide!

22:36.038 --> 22:37.936
You have the order of your king!

22:37.938 --> 22:42.004
But our losses! We lose
hundreds each day, we cannot...

22:42.006 --> 22:46.770
Yes, their sacrifice may
deplete our number in flesh...

22:46.772 --> 22:52.702
but in spirit, it makes our gods stronger.

22:52.704 --> 22:58.203
And winning the favor of the gods
is the only way we can truly triumph.

22:58.205 --> 23:01.536
You have the command of your king.

23:01.538 --> 23:05.637
Bring the fight to the enemy head on!

23:05.639 --> 23:09.136
And no more talk of tactics.

23:09.138 --> 23:15.170
Unless you wish to
prove yourselves cowards.

23:15.172 --> 23:18.970
The king is robbed of his
wits. He sends us to our deaths.

23:18.972 --> 23:22.103
Not the king... Aberthol.

23:22.105 --> 23:25.739
He has some dark purpose in this, mark me.

25:37.072 --> 25:39.204
Druid!

25:39.206 --> 25:41.603
You lead us to the slaughter!

25:41.605 --> 25:44.937
We die by Saxon swords, but
it is you we have to blame!

25:44.939 --> 25:49.669
What say you? What say you!

25:49.671 --> 25:54.737
Is this the one who prevented
the offering of the woman?

25:54.739 --> 25:56.103
Yes.

25:56.105 --> 25:58.669
Very well.

25:58.671 --> 26:04.769
Our fallen warriors honor
the gods with their sacrifice.

26:04.771 --> 26:08.770
Since you did not see fit to
join their tribute in battle...

26:08.772 --> 26:12.937
you may follow them now. You die here.

26:12.939 --> 26:15.703
What? But he is the son of Cador!

26:15.705 --> 26:20.603
Your father became friend to
the king a long time ago, no?

26:20.605 --> 26:26.770
I wonder if the king recalls
such a distant memory.

26:26.772 --> 26:30.537
Kill him, Lucan... make an offering of him!

26:30.539 --> 26:32.136
No, you cannot! You cannot kill him!

26:32.138 --> 26:34.669
He has saved the king's life in battle!

26:34.671 --> 26:40.203
My king! Has Arthfael not saved
your life in battle this day?

26:40.205 --> 26:42.603
Yes, I think he has, yes.

26:42.605 --> 26:45.602
And you will not see him
made a sacrifice, my king.

26:45.604 --> 26:49.203
Sacrifice? No, there
will be no sacrifice here.

26:49.205 --> 26:55.669
My most worthy king...
this man is treacherous.

26:55.671 --> 27:01.205
He challenges my authority, and any challenge
to my authority is a challenge to yours!

27:03.639 --> 27:06.636
Do you challenge Aberthol?

27:06.638 --> 27:07.703
I do!

27:07.705 --> 27:10.502
Where are your father's lands?

27:10.504 --> 27:13.937
Cornwall. You are friend to my father.

27:13.939 --> 27:15.470
Then return there.

27:15.472 --> 27:17.636
My king?

27:17.638 --> 27:21.503
You are banished! It is that or your death.

27:21.505 --> 27:24.137
Choose as you will.

27:24.139 --> 27:27.069
I thank you for your service,
and I release you from it.

27:27.071 --> 27:30.072
I cannot have division in my ranks.

27:31.838 --> 27:37.136
Aberthol, prepare to
leave. Olwen, do not dally.

27:37.138 --> 27:40.103
Ensure the other wards leave safely.

27:40.105 --> 27:46.069
We retreat to the
stronghold of Dinas Affaraon.

27:46.071 --> 27:47.970
But my lord...

27:57.972 --> 28:03.003
How dare the king defy
me! Feeble-minded cretin!

28:03.005 --> 28:08.005
It's that Cornish bastard's
fault, my druid, and his woman.

28:09.204 --> 28:13.470
Draw no undue attention.

28:13.472 --> 28:16.737
Let him to feel the pain of
his banishment for a day...

28:16.739 --> 28:20.973
then hunt him down and butcher him.

28:22.505 --> 28:25.407
I'll watch the meddlesome wench myself.

28:48.204 --> 28:55.737
<i>Kunoto-kolu... sanus
korro... parra korri...</i>

28:55.739 --> 29:02.040
<i>Kunoto-kolu... sanus
korro... parra...</i>

29:03.106 --> 29:07.036
We will seek out the king. We'll
convince him to change his mind.

29:07.038 --> 29:08.870
We are all away from our homelands.

29:08.872 --> 29:11.803
Vortigern is a father
to us and he is our king.

29:11.805 --> 29:13.804
Right or wrong, when
he speaks, we must obey.

29:13.806 --> 29:15.536
But does he speak?

29:15.538 --> 29:17.937
The man we follow now is not
the king I followed before.

29:17.939 --> 29:20.703
He wears the crown!

29:20.705 --> 29:23.773
My loyalty to that is
absolute, as should yours be!

29:28.604 --> 29:31.170
We would none of us be
the men we are without him.

29:31.172 --> 29:33.502
I will see you again, brothers.

29:33.504 --> 29:36.339
When you defeat the invaders, we
will drink at my father's table.

30:11.871 --> 30:18.602
Kunoto-kolu... sanus korro... parra korri.

30:18.604 --> 30:24.672
Kunoto-kolu... sanus korro... parra korri.

31:10.539 --> 31:13.803
If you were as late to your battles
as you are to our meetings...

31:13.805 --> 31:16.438
these lands would already
be overrun with Saxons.

31:25.839 --> 31:27.737
I am so sorry.

31:27.739 --> 31:30.036
You do not deserve to suffer
what the king has done.

31:30.038 --> 31:34.436
Hush, it matters not, it
was a gift in disguise.

31:34.438 --> 31:36.068
Now I am free to stop Aberthol!

31:36.070 --> 31:38.937
You have obsessed about
the druid all these years.

31:38.939 --> 31:42.035
He is a cruel man bent on sacrifice...

31:42.037 --> 31:44.669
but he is not the enemy we must defeat.

31:44.671 --> 31:47.036
He worships a dark icon... the dark gods.

31:47.038 --> 31:50.170
He prays for our defeat
and a Saxon triumph.

31:50.172 --> 31:51.769
- He is in league with the enemy!
- No...

31:51.771 --> 31:54.837
- I know it to be true.
- How?

31:54.839 --> 31:56.603
I spied on him in his tent.

31:56.605 --> 31:59.469
You did what? Are you not
in trouble enough already?

31:59.471 --> 32:02.069
Our people are the ones who are
in trouble, but I have the answer.

32:02.071 --> 32:04.537
Remember the boy that I spoke
of, the one with the mark?

32:04.539 --> 32:06.036
You said Wynar Forest took him.

32:06.038 --> 32:07.836
No, he lives still!

32:07.838 --> 32:10.804
He is the only one that I
have ever seen the druid fear.

32:10.806 --> 32:14.103
This boy had powers over nature.

32:14.105 --> 32:17.936
But if we can find him, he will
help us stop Aberthol, I know it.

32:17.938 --> 32:21.570
We must journey to the village, to Wynar.

32:21.572 --> 32:23.969
I will send word to my uncle.
He owns lands near Wynar.

32:23.971 --> 32:25.068
He will see you safe passage.

32:25.070 --> 32:28.371
No, we cannot tell anyone of this.

32:30.639 --> 32:34.068
See me safe passage?

32:34.070 --> 32:36.272
You have no pack. Where are your things?

32:37.771 --> 32:40.503
I cannot come with you.

32:40.505 --> 32:43.903
The king ails... I must remain at his side.

32:43.905 --> 32:46.537
And if what you say has truth...

32:46.539 --> 32:49.503
then surely we cannot leave
him at the mercy of Aberthol.

32:49.505 --> 32:50.968
You won't be safe!

32:50.970 --> 32:55.569
I am a ward of the king and of noble blood.

32:55.571 --> 32:57.968
There is yet a limit to Aberthol's reach.

32:57.970 --> 33:01.003
And I will have the
swords of three warriors.

33:01.005 --> 33:06.173
Eógan, Brían and Fáelán have
pledged to watch over me in your absence.

33:08.471 --> 33:12.470
Would that I had met a timid woman...

33:12.472 --> 33:14.436
then I should never feel this fear.

33:14.438 --> 33:17.769
Would that I had fallen in love
with a rich, fat chieftain...

33:17.771 --> 33:22.738
then never would he run off
on such dangerous adventures.

33:25.739 --> 33:28.469
Journey safe to Dinas Affaraon.

33:28.471 --> 33:32.603
Watch for Aberthol and his puppet Lucan.

33:32.605 --> 33:35.205
I will return to you.

34:23.772 --> 34:28.601
You travel alone, my druid. Where is Lucan?

34:28.603 --> 34:33.469
Surely I have no need of guards
whilst I'm amongst friends.

34:33.472 --> 34:37.706
Lucan has work to do elsewhere.

35:59.604 --> 36:02.169
Not him.

36:02.171 --> 36:07.104
I think our friend is not going
home to Cornwall after all.

36:10.638 --> 36:13.470
Then we will go back.

36:13.472 --> 36:16.339
Find him!

36:28.571 --> 36:30.806
He was young, he bore a mark.

36:34.005 --> 36:37.903
Excuse me, I'm sorry to trouble you, I...

36:37.905 --> 36:41.339
Excuse me, I seek a boy, well, a man now...

36:49.037 --> 36:51.869
He never came out of the woods, that boy.

36:51.871 --> 36:56.906
Died in there, like many before him.

36:58.204 --> 37:02.272
Only a foolish man
dares venture into Wynar.

38:15.038 --> 38:17.205
Agh!

38:47.472 --> 38:50.272
He has ventured into Wynar.

38:52.870 --> 38:57.871
If he has gone in, then
our work is done for us.

39:00.538 --> 39:03.004
But we must be sure.

39:04.172 --> 39:07.536
And if he is dead?

39:07.538 --> 39:09.936
We have to find another offering?

39:09.938 --> 39:11.872
Very good!

39:58.871 --> 40:01.673
Why have you brought me here?

40:03.770 --> 40:06.005
Show me where he is!

40:08.805 --> 40:13.935
Come on. Show me.

40:13.937 --> 40:17.202
Come on!

40:17.204 --> 40:19.669
Show me, come on!

40:19.671 --> 40:23.035
What use are you if you bring
me this far just to abandon me?

41:08.571 --> 41:11.935
My king?

41:11.937 --> 41:13.705
My king?

41:16.871 --> 41:19.569
What is it?

41:19.571 --> 41:23.436
I come to tend your wound. It heals slowly.

41:23.438 --> 41:28.601
You are a ward of my court, it is
not your task to deal with blood.

41:28.603 --> 41:32.304
I asked that I may do it, my king.

41:35.070 --> 41:38.038
A complex thing... battle...

41:48.005 --> 41:50.805
Do you remember this?

41:53.204 --> 41:59.938
Of course... this figure
represents the guard of my warriors.

42:03.704 --> 42:06.601
Is there something else I
should remember about it?

42:06.603 --> 42:11.439
Do you remember that I made it,
when first I came into your care?

42:12.737 --> 42:19.701
Of course... you are...

42:19.703 --> 42:22.036
Olwen. I am Olwen.

42:22.038 --> 42:27.468
Olwen, of course you are!
Olwen, your father is my cousin.

42:27.470 --> 42:32.568
I look forward to feasting with
him when our lands are free again.

42:32.570 --> 42:35.171
My father's dead.

42:41.771 --> 42:45.072
Takes a clever girl to trap a king.

42:50.171 --> 42:54.371
Perhaps I have become too easy to trap.

43:07.738 --> 43:15.135
I survived the blow, but I fear
I left my wits on the battlefield.

43:15.137 --> 43:22.669
Tell me, Olwen, is it as obvious
to all as it is to you that I ail?

43:22.671 --> 43:26.735
To some... to those who
care about their king.

43:26.737 --> 43:34.069
I matter not. Do you not think
that I know that I fail them?

43:34.071 --> 43:37.002
But I have no heir...

43:37.004 --> 43:42.838
so I cannot relinquish the
throne, no matter how much I ail.

43:44.871 --> 43:50.069
Not until this war is won.

43:50.071 --> 43:54.602
I'm already going to leave
my people without a king.

43:54.604 --> 43:57.905
I cannot leave them without a kingdom, too.

44:00.571 --> 44:02.802
The druid helps you?

44:02.804 --> 44:07.103
Aberthol protects my troops
from my forgetfulness.

44:07.105 --> 44:09.871
I hear he practices a dark magic.

44:12.138 --> 44:13.636
I have no time for magic.

44:13.638 --> 44:16.769
But if it is dark?

44:16.771 --> 44:18.868
What do you speak of? Who are you?

44:18.870 --> 44:21.036
What are you doing here in my chambers?

44:21.038 --> 44:24.805
Get out, child! And do
not intrude so again!

44:26.704 --> 44:28.772
Ah, my druid!

46:15.438 --> 46:22.802
<i>Fyrst pu trufla drauma mina,
nu pu raoast heimili mitt!</i>

46:22.804 --> 46:29.035
<i>Fyrst pu trufla drauma mina,
nu pu raoast heimili mitt!</i>

46:29.037 --> 46:34.238
I do not understand you, friend!
I do not understand your words.

46:37.204 --> 46:42.304
First... you intrude on my dreams.

46:43.504 --> 46:47.067
Now... you invade my home.

46:47.069 --> 46:52.102
Not your dreams... your
visions. You are a wizard!

46:52.104 --> 46:53.535
You do not know me.

46:53.537 --> 46:59.202
But I do. You live because of me.

46:59.204 --> 47:04.535
Many years ago in the village...
I helped you escape with your life.

47:04.537 --> 47:09.034
You bit me on the hand...
a lot harder than I expected.

47:09.036 --> 47:12.736
I was spared by the Tuadaan...

47:12.738 --> 47:15.468
so I could be led here to learn their ways.

47:15.470 --> 47:18.436
You were merely an
instrument they acted through.

47:18.438 --> 47:21.071
I am no man's instrument.

47:24.204 --> 47:31.769
The Tuadaan are not men...
and neither am I, not anymore.

47:31.771 --> 47:37.769
But you are... so how did
you pass through my forest?

47:37.771 --> 47:39.669
My means are my own.

47:39.671 --> 47:46.772
A man who has no answer has no
knowledge. So it was only luck.

47:49.170 --> 47:52.601
Leave my home and my forest...

47:52.603 --> 47:56.838
and hope your luck lasts
until you reach Wynar's border.

47:59.937 --> 48:05.768
I shall leave... but you must come with me.

48:05.770 --> 48:08.502
I seek to vanquish the druid
who tried to kill you...

48:08.504 --> 48:10.935
who killed your mother.

48:10.937 --> 48:16.134
He prays to dark gods, he works dark magic.

48:16.136 --> 48:18.168
He is leading the Celts to the slaughter!

48:18.170 --> 48:19.736
It matters not.

48:19.738 --> 48:21.868
But we shared the vision, I saw you.

48:21.870 --> 48:24.836
This cave shows me much of
what happens across these lands.

48:24.838 --> 48:28.803
The action of one druid is no
more important than anything else.

48:28.805 --> 48:31.169
But this druid murdered your
mother! Do you not seek revenge?

48:31.171 --> 48:33.102
Revenge is a weakness of men.

48:33.104 --> 48:36.101
I have already told you,
I am no longer a man.

48:36.103 --> 48:40.035
Are you so sure?

48:40.037 --> 48:42.602
If you are no longer a
man, why are you afraid?

48:42.604 --> 48:44.569
I do not fear.

48:44.571 --> 48:49.202
Men hide when they are
scared. Fear keeps you here...

48:49.204 --> 48:52.701
I am preparing!

48:52.703 --> 48:57.835
Men may have forgotten about the
eternal war between light and darkness...

48:57.837 --> 49:01.668
but the divine race who fight
on in the underworld have not.

49:01.670 --> 49:05.802
They left their teachings in this cave
and called me here to learn their magic...

49:05.804 --> 49:10.835
so that one day I could be a champion of
light in these lands as they once were.

49:10.837 --> 49:16.635
So that I could defeat the
darkness in man's darkest hour.

49:16.637 --> 49:20.635
That time has yet to come.
The cave has much to teach me.

49:20.637 --> 49:27.769
I will fight darkness one
day, but I am not yet ready.

49:27.771 --> 49:33.535
Ready? Not ready? What
is this cave teaching you?

49:33.537 --> 49:36.468
We are never ready.

49:36.470 --> 49:38.836
The only way that we can
reach our true potential...

49:38.838 --> 49:41.338
is when we rise to the
challenges that life throws to us.

49:44.037 --> 49:46.701
I will not be swayed, warrior.

49:46.703 --> 49:50.101
There is a battle out there! Our
people are dying in the thousands!

49:50.103 --> 49:51.803
This druid leads the Celts to slaughter.

49:51.805 --> 49:55.002
In the eons of time, one
people does not matter.

49:55.004 --> 49:56.168
But they're your people!

49:56.170 --> 49:58.971
I don't have a people.

50:00.671 --> 50:06.469
Do not mistake my composure for tolerance.

50:06.471 --> 50:11.102
Go now... or I shall make you.

50:11.104 --> 50:14.772
I will save my people!

50:33.004 --> 50:35.034
Your friends are all dead.

50:35.036 --> 50:36.935
My life as a man taught me one thing.

50:36.937 --> 50:41.735
You cannot save people. There is no point.

50:41.737 --> 50:44.303
Perhaps now you see.

50:59.003 --> 51:02.602
I should not have shown you
their deaths without warning.

51:02.604 --> 51:06.569
I am... sorry for your pain.

51:06.571 --> 51:08.238
Even though I cannot feel it with you.

51:10.637 --> 51:14.967
It was pain as you feel now
that led me to this place.

51:14.969 --> 51:17.938
I know.

51:20.537 --> 51:24.101
I saw it in your eyes
when Aberthol killed her.

51:24.103 --> 51:25.769
I shall lead you to the forest edge.

51:25.771 --> 51:27.169
I do not need your charity.

51:27.171 --> 51:30.469
I do not offer charity. I offer protection.

51:30.471 --> 51:33.101
Wynar can render a man limb from limb.

51:33.103 --> 51:38.071
However you came to defeat it before, the forest
will not be beaten twice, I can assure you.

51:53.803 --> 51:59.768
Do not weep. Their sacrifice
will help our cause.

51:59.770 --> 52:05.501
And perhaps it may also teach
you not to intrude on the king.

52:05.503 --> 52:09.871
And not to challenge me.

52:11.970 --> 52:16.204
There is no one to protect you now.

52:26.170 --> 52:31.435
Your friends were loyal,
yes? Followed you with honor?

52:31.437 --> 52:33.868
Yes.

52:33.870 --> 52:37.001
Then they would not want
you to ache so for them.

52:37.003 --> 52:40.435
They followed the wrong man.

52:40.437 --> 52:42.601
I should never have been
given men into my charge.

52:42.603 --> 52:47.067
I am no leader. I am the fourth
son of a Cornish Chieftain.

52:47.069 --> 52:51.201
And a bastard son at that.

52:51.203 --> 52:54.468
I would have done well to keep my mouth
shut and follow the druid to destruction.

52:54.470 --> 52:58.035
This brand of sorrow is for
yourself as much for them.

52:58.037 --> 53:01.102
It is of no benefit but to fuel
your guilt and lessen your will.

53:01.104 --> 53:02.536
Do not test me, wizard.

53:02.538 --> 53:07.502
You are weak... of body.

53:07.504 --> 53:09.971
Come, you need food.

53:23.770 --> 53:28.705
Perhaps you're right. Maybe
you are no longer a man.

53:57.204 --> 54:01.735
There are some places
the sun never reaches.

54:01.737 --> 54:04.734
They could not bloom.

54:04.736 --> 54:08.568
I am gladdened to see that
you truly have powers, wizard.

54:08.570 --> 54:15.303
But tell me, why do you see purpose
in saving flowers and not people?

54:40.170 --> 54:46.001
Thousands die... thousands more will fall.

54:46.003 --> 54:48.001
You can help me stop this.

54:48.003 --> 54:51.469
You must help me save the king from
the grip of Aberthol! I beg you.

54:51.471 --> 54:54.867
I will not leave this
forest until I am ready.

54:54.869 --> 54:56.968
Until I am strong enough
to defeat the darkness.

54:56.970 --> 55:01.802
I am sorry for your pain,
warrior, but I cannot help you.

55:09.602 --> 55:11.068
From where did you steal this?

55:11.070 --> 55:12.834
- I did not steal this.
- Where did you find it?

55:12.836 --> 55:15.634
- Why do you care?
- Where?

55:15.636 --> 55:17.435
- A swamp.
- A swamp?

55:17.437 --> 55:19.535
A marsh, a small bog, whichever you prefer?

55:19.537 --> 55:21.767
And you found me through this, yes?

55:21.769 --> 55:26.035
It was the sword that opened my visions
to you, and kept the forest at bay.

55:26.037 --> 55:28.135
Yes.

55:28.137 --> 55:31.567
So it has spoken to you...

55:31.569 --> 55:35.102
but you... you're just...

55:35.104 --> 55:37.601
I'm just...

55:37.603 --> 55:40.567
What, what am I?

55:40.569 --> 55:42.634
I thought I knew...

55:42.636 --> 55:46.404
but perhaps I don't know
what you are after all.

56:16.036 --> 56:17.435
What happened here?

56:17.437 --> 56:18.701
Please, don't hurt me!

56:18.703 --> 56:21.568
Why would I harm you? Tell me now!

56:21.570 --> 56:24.534
Men... dressed like you they were.

56:24.536 --> 56:27.500
Said they sought a lone
warrior, a rogue, they said.

56:27.502 --> 56:31.701
And when we could not help them, they sacrificed
our village in the name of the king's druid.

56:31.703 --> 56:37.070
These men, dressed like me you
say? Led by a giant of a man?

56:39.503 --> 56:42.601
It's you they sought.

56:42.603 --> 56:46.771
Look! Look what they've done to us!

56:49.602 --> 56:50.735
Lucan.

56:50.737 --> 56:53.237
You brought this here, warrior.

56:55.004 --> 56:56.667
And you brought me here, wizard.

56:56.669 --> 57:00.135
Come with me.

57:00.137 --> 57:04.237
Please. We must find someone.

57:11.536 --> 57:14.600
Nia!

57:14.602 --> 57:16.001
Nia!

57:16.003 --> 57:17.836
Nia!

57:19.004 --> 57:21.070
Nia?

57:25.103 --> 57:26.802
Myrrdin?

57:26.804 --> 57:31.735
I am... glad you are alive.

57:31.737 --> 57:37.134
You live? Where have you been?

57:37.136 --> 57:44.038
The forest... I found refuge
when I fled. It kept me safe.

57:45.569 --> 57:52.700
Safe? You have been safe?

57:52.702 --> 57:56.068
That is good.

57:56.070 --> 57:58.071
We have not, Myrrdin.

57:59.970 --> 58:04.802
When you ran away, the king
would not help us again.

58:04.804 --> 58:10.568
Our crops failed each year and
all we could do was go hungry.

58:10.570 --> 58:16.734
And when we suffered those
hardships, I always thought of you.

58:16.736 --> 58:19.767
I thought of your power.

58:19.769 --> 58:24.700
I thought, would Myrrdin
were alive, he would help us.

58:24.702 --> 58:28.703
He would make the crops grow
as he made the flowers bloom.

58:30.970 --> 58:36.169
And I wept because I thought you were dead.

58:36.171 --> 58:40.204
But all the while you were hiding nearby.

58:42.436 --> 58:45.768
Did you watch us starve?

58:45.770 --> 58:50.004
What man does not show
himself if he can help?

58:53.769 --> 58:56.404
My husband died this day.

58:58.469 --> 59:03.902
He fought the men who came
here, so that we might survive.

59:03.904 --> 59:11.204
It will be his death I mark
this day for, not your life.

59:13.702 --> 59:16.202
Be safe.

59:49.203 --> 59:52.168
I must convince the king somehow...

59:52.170 --> 59:55.968
make him see that he has
fallen into Aberthol's grip.

59:55.970 --> 59:59.168
But how can I convince a mind that ails so?

59:59.170 --> 01:00:02.834
When my brother and I
would fight as children...

01:00:02.836 --> 01:00:06.168
we would run to my father and
ask him to settle our discord.

01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:08.567
We would clamor and shout
for father's favor...

01:00:08.569 --> 01:00:10.902
but he would always say
that if we had accusations...

01:00:10.904 --> 01:00:15.834
he would only hear them if there was
some sign of the other's rascalry.

01:00:15.836 --> 01:00:20.867
Such a sign is a powerful thing.

01:00:20.869 --> 01:00:24.834
Perhaps if the king could hold
the druid's guilt in his own hands.

01:00:24.836 --> 01:00:27.138
Evidence.

01:01:59.804 --> 01:02:02.635
The Dragon Guardian.

01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:25.568
They'll settle elsewhere.

01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:30.237
Of course, they will. I
need no reassurance, warrior.

01:02:32.737 --> 01:02:36.837
The light fails. I must
camp away from here.

01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:40.435
The men who hunt me
may pass this way again.

01:02:40.437 --> 01:02:41.967
I will stay with you.

01:02:41.969 --> 01:02:43.901
You mean to accompany me now?

01:02:43.903 --> 01:02:48.671
No, my forest slumbers at night.
I will not disturb its rest.

01:02:50.503 --> 01:02:53.771
Then Wynar's loss is my gain.

01:03:03.836 --> 01:03:06.435
You should make a fire.

01:03:06.437 --> 01:03:08.768
I am hunted, wizard. I need no beacon.

01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:11.535
Your cave has not taught
you much about evading men.

01:03:11.537 --> 01:03:14.404
There are no men to evade in Wynar.

01:03:19.603 --> 01:03:24.167
The girl in the village,
Nia. Did you love her once?

01:03:24.169 --> 01:03:27.369
I know little of love.

01:03:30.202 --> 01:03:35.035
Surely a man who can control the growth of
a flower must be able to make love blossom.

01:03:35.037 --> 01:03:41.066
It is one thing to affect nature,
but a human is a different matter.

01:03:41.068 --> 01:03:45.968
Only the most powerful sorcerer could
control the mind of a man or woman.

01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:49.767
Do not mistake what you have
found, I am no such sorcerer.

01:03:49.769 --> 01:03:51.968
And Aberthol?

01:03:51.970 --> 01:03:53.902
He is powerful, yes.

01:03:53.904 --> 01:03:57.534
Then does he bewitch the king? Is
it Aberthol who weakens his memory?

01:03:57.536 --> 01:04:01.834
Even Aberthol is not powerful
enough to hold a man entranced.

01:04:01.836 --> 01:04:04.168
Not for as long as I have
watched your king ail.

01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:07.667
It is his injuries that rob
him of his wit, not the druid.

01:04:07.669 --> 01:04:10.168
And will you not help save
a broken man from evil?

01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:11.935
To save more villages like yours?

01:04:11.937 --> 01:04:14.734
One king... a handful of villages?

01:04:14.736 --> 01:04:19.834
You really think this is
man's greatest hour of need?

01:04:19.836 --> 01:04:23.635
The mark on your face, it reminds
me of the claw of a dragon.

01:04:23.637 --> 01:04:25.767
It is merely the mark of the Tuadaan.

01:04:25.769 --> 01:04:27.834
And if the Tuadaan have
marked you out as a dragon...

01:04:27.836 --> 01:04:31.667
the symbol of the Celts

01:04:31.669 --> 01:04:33.936
then perhaps you are
to be our champion yet.

01:04:35.837 --> 01:04:39.271
I just hope you're ready before
there are none of us left.

01:04:54.169 --> 01:04:55.736
Damn.

01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:46.404
But I am not ready.

01:05:55.836 --> 01:05:57.837
I thought you had gone.

01:05:59.902 --> 01:06:03.200
I know you desire to leave, go
back to your cave, but please.

01:06:03.202 --> 01:06:06.200
Very well, I shall accompany you.

01:06:06.202 --> 01:06:08.767
You make a very persuasive argument.

01:06:08.769 --> 01:06:11.500
We shall return to Dinas
Affaraon to vanquish Aberthol.

01:06:11.502 --> 01:06:13.568
A fair pact?

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:17.038
Excellent. We must hurry.

01:06:21.003 --> 01:06:22.803
Wizard!

01:06:28.537 --> 01:06:35.802
Their numbers strengthen,
yet they do not advance.

01:06:35.804 --> 01:06:39.767
Perhaps a truce? A co-existence?

01:06:39.769 --> 01:06:45.100
My king, the Saxons do not seek peace.

01:06:45.102 --> 01:06:48.834
They will push us until we are
driven into the sea or the earth.

01:06:48.836 --> 01:06:51.866
If they don't advance, we must.

01:06:51.868 --> 01:06:54.734
Attack is the best form of defense.

01:06:54.736 --> 01:06:57.200
Attack?

01:06:57.202 --> 01:07:02.771
Commit a thousand more
warriors. Attack them head on!

01:07:05.968 --> 01:07:10.435
Tell me, wizard, what's our plan?
How will you vanquish Aberthol?

01:07:10.437 --> 01:07:13.200
I do not know. It is
your quest I have joined.

01:07:13.202 --> 01:07:17.568
As it is my quest, I must admit that
my only plan is the wizard Myrrdin.

01:07:17.570 --> 01:07:19.435
Tell me plain, how will you defeat him?

01:07:19.437 --> 01:07:21.734
He fears you, I have seen it.

01:07:21.736 --> 01:07:25.467
He fears what I represent. I
cannot say if he will fear me.

01:07:25.469 --> 01:07:27.866
Then you really aren't
sure if you can defeat him?

01:07:27.868 --> 01:07:32.967
I'm sure of nothing, save that it is not only
Aberthol we must vanquish from Dinas Affaraon.

01:07:32.969 --> 01:07:35.866
Who else must we defeat?

01:07:35.868 --> 01:07:37.970
The king.

01:07:39.002 --> 01:07:40.933
We go to save the king!

01:07:40.935 --> 01:07:43.834
Strange that a man who desires
so much to save the king...

01:07:43.836 --> 01:07:46.933
should carry the sword of one
who will take the throne from him.

01:07:46.935 --> 01:07:49.701
Of what do you speak? It is
treason to even utter such words.

01:07:49.703 --> 01:07:51.467
Perhaps.

01:07:51.469 --> 01:07:53.601
But you wield the great sword Nuadu...

01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:57.700
a gift to the Tuadaan from
the gods of light themselves.

01:07:57.702 --> 01:08:00.133
Nuadu fought to defeat the
darkness on these very lands...

01:08:00.135 --> 01:08:04.200
before the Great War
descended to the underworld.

01:08:04.202 --> 01:08:08.867
It is said that when the time would
come for the Tuadaan to pass Nuadu...

01:08:08.869 --> 01:08:10.767
back to the world of men

01:08:10.769 --> 01:08:15.535
it would only speak to he who
would become king of the Celts.

01:08:15.537 --> 01:08:17.801
You mock me, wizard.

01:08:17.803 --> 01:08:20.866
A bastard of Cornwall
is no king and no leader.

01:08:20.868 --> 01:08:24.567
Do not speak of this again.

01:08:24.569 --> 01:08:27.803
If it pleases you, my king.

01:08:31.002 --> 01:08:35.801
If this is from the Tuadaan,
then you can read these marks, no?

01:08:35.803 --> 01:08:39.200
I can, but I already know what it says.

01:08:39.202 --> 01:08:41.701
It speaks to the sword's
original purpose...

01:08:41.703 --> 01:08:44.001
the reason it was hewn.

01:08:44.002 --> 01:08:48.500
<i>Gert af guoi, au drepa guoi.</i>

01:08:48.502 --> 01:08:53.700
Made by gods... to kill gods.

01:09:05.103 --> 01:09:08.501
Your assistance would benefit me greatly!

01:09:08.502 --> 01:09:10.966
Two against one would not be fair.

01:09:10.969 --> 01:09:16.435
One of the first things the cave taught
me was a sense of equality and fairness.

01:09:16.437 --> 01:09:18.667
It's a fundamental tenet of the Tuadaan.

01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:20.937
Of course, it is!

01:09:30.002 --> 01:09:31.167
Not a god.

01:09:31.169 --> 01:09:34.067
One of Lucan's men. Run.

01:10:11.903 --> 01:10:13.667
I thought you could not
control the minds of men?

01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:17.203
Shhhh! He is blinded, not deafened.

01:10:24.169 --> 01:10:26.737
I see you.

01:10:27.968 --> 01:10:29.703
Blast.

01:10:30.803 --> 01:10:32.437
They're over here!

01:10:49.135 --> 01:10:51.535
You already told me you could
not manipulate the minds of men.

01:10:51.537 --> 01:10:52.967
I did not need a demonstration!

01:10:52.969 --> 01:10:55.201
It was a foolish thing
to attempt, I apologize.

01:10:55.203 --> 01:10:58.037
Apologize later, live first.

01:11:20.569 --> 01:11:22.501
- We must move.
- Shhhh!

01:11:22.503 --> 01:11:23.933
I strongly...

01:11:23.935 --> 01:11:25.737
You've had your chance
to save us, now's mine!

01:11:30.735 --> 01:11:32.933
You see?

01:11:32.935 --> 01:11:34.666
We are not safe here!

01:11:34.668 --> 01:11:36.599
What, you sense something?

01:11:36.601 --> 01:11:38.370
Not exactly.

01:11:51.869 --> 01:11:56.534
15 years to sharpen your senses and you cannot
hear the advance of two flat-footed poachers!

01:11:56.536 --> 01:12:00.000
They were very quiet... at first.

01:12:00.002 --> 01:12:02.501
Should I be disappointed that
the future king of the Celts...

01:12:02.503 --> 01:12:04.633
couldn't vanquish them
with his magical sword?

01:12:04.635 --> 01:12:05.969
Don't call me that.

01:12:10.169 --> 01:12:12.336
Ha!

01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:21.500
A hefty catch indeed, but they
will not feed our families.

01:12:21.502 --> 01:12:24.167
Look at this one. There's
more meat on my scabbard!

01:12:24.169 --> 01:12:28.634
I found them in the wood. They
were fleeing the king's warriors.

01:12:28.636 --> 01:12:30.168
Were they now?

01:12:30.170 --> 01:12:33.001
Remember we are hunted.
They cannot learn who I am!

01:12:33.003 --> 01:12:34.800
What are your names?

01:12:34.802 --> 01:12:36.833
I am Myrrdin, this is Arthfael...

01:12:36.835 --> 01:12:39.067
born of Cornwall and
banished from the king's army.

01:12:39.069 --> 01:12:42.936
We march to Dinas Affaraon
to take the throne.

01:12:45.803 --> 01:12:47.700
Did you mean for me to lie?

01:12:51.436 --> 01:12:54.200
I like you, boy, you're funny!

01:12:54.202 --> 01:12:57.667
You're lucky you're in my
custody and not Lucan's.

01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:59.934
I am Orin.

01:12:59.936 --> 01:13:05.534
My niece, Olwen, has had me out
here for three moons looking for you!

01:13:05.536 --> 01:13:09.500
She begged me to give you safe
passage across these lands.

01:13:09.502 --> 01:13:13.936
I hope you're gonna tell me what's so
important about you and your friend!

01:13:15.002 --> 01:13:17.002
Let's go.

01:13:24.935 --> 01:13:27.500
I told her not to send word to you.

01:13:27.502 --> 01:13:32.700
Olwen has always been her own
woman. I have such a woman myself.

01:13:32.702 --> 01:13:38.168
I dare say she rules my lands as much as I
do, even if she lets me believe otherwise.

01:13:38.170 --> 01:13:41.003
To good women!

01:13:43.636 --> 01:13:45.599
Why do you not join us, Myrrdin?

01:13:45.601 --> 01:13:48.033
A man who does not drink
only arouses suspicion!

01:13:48.035 --> 01:13:50.599
What is it that has
stolen your taste for mead?

01:13:50.601 --> 01:13:52.833
I have been schooled as
a beacon of the Tuadaan.

01:13:52.835 --> 01:13:56.600
My friend has too much
a taste for the mead.

01:13:56.602 --> 01:14:01.703
One drop and we will not be
able to control him. A wild man!

01:14:07.203 --> 01:14:11.966
So, do I aid the man that
would overthrow the king?

01:14:11.968 --> 01:14:16.500
No, you aid the man who would
free him from the druid Aberthol.

01:14:16.502 --> 01:14:20.167
Aberthol?

01:14:20.169 --> 01:14:24.567
I was by the king's side when
Aberthol came into his favor.

01:14:24.569 --> 01:14:30.033
The druid is perhaps too
rooted in the old ways...

01:14:30.035 --> 01:14:34.134
but the king always
valued his counsel greatly.

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:40.900
The king ails now. The
toils of battle are upon him.

01:14:40.902 --> 01:14:44.967
Aberthol alone controls our forces
and he guides them to their deaths.

01:14:44.969 --> 01:14:47.001
He is in league with the Saxons.

01:14:47.003 --> 01:14:49.833
No... it cannot be.

01:14:49.835 --> 01:14:52.866
He worships a dark icon. I have seen it.

01:14:52.868 --> 01:14:54.633
He prays for our defeat.

01:14:54.635 --> 01:14:59.001
We could use your metal,
Orin. Ours is a worthy quest.

01:14:59.003 --> 01:15:03.101
I withdrew my pledge to the
king years ago, Olwen knows that.

01:15:03.103 --> 01:15:08.667
These were once my finest warriors,
but we are now simple hunters.

01:15:08.669 --> 01:15:12.000
I fight only for my lands and people.

01:15:12.002 --> 01:15:19.000
I do not like the news that you bring,
but I must let Aberthol do his worst.

01:15:19.002 --> 01:15:21.766
The Saxons will be no worse
overlords than the Romans were.

01:15:21.768 --> 01:15:25.969
And what will the lives of you and your people
be worth if you alone among the Celts survive?

01:15:30.803 --> 01:15:33.734
Do you sing?

01:15:33.736 --> 01:15:38.200
I... I am a very fine singer.

01:15:38.202 --> 01:15:40.869
I am a very fine singer!

01:15:42.903 --> 01:15:47.101
What song inspires you the most?

01:15:47.103 --> 01:15:52.101
The songs of my fathers, of battle.

01:15:52.103 --> 01:15:54.070
Please.

01:16:04.836 --> 01:16:10.970
♪ As the cry went out
the lands had fallen ♪

01:16:12.502 --> 01:16:17.000
♪ And all the Celts did rise ♪

01:16:17.002 --> 01:16:18.967
With chests of fire...

01:16:18.969 --> 01:16:20.970
Stop!

01:16:22.203 --> 01:16:26.499
What do you hear?

01:16:26.501 --> 01:16:28.833
I hear nothing.

01:16:28.835 --> 01:16:35.700
Precisely. This is what will happen
to our songs if our people are overrun.

01:16:35.702 --> 01:16:40.801
We are more than just flesh
and blood, more than land.

01:16:40.803 --> 01:16:44.201
The spirits of our
ancestors are in our songs.

01:16:44.203 --> 01:16:48.700
The skill of our craftsmen is in
our blades and your arrow heads.

01:16:48.702 --> 01:16:52.902
The beauty of our women is in the
poetry of the men who love them.

01:16:54.536 --> 01:16:56.834
And all of this will die, too.

01:16:56.836 --> 01:17:01.167
The songs you sing, the
people that you sing about.

01:17:01.169 --> 01:17:03.566
They will become nothing more than...

01:17:03.568 --> 01:17:10.567
than history... myths... and then they
will be forgotten and lost forever.

01:17:10.569 --> 01:17:16.600
I need to stop Aberthol not just to save
life and land, but to save everything.

01:17:16.602 --> 01:17:19.733
There is only one fight. Fight it with me.

01:17:19.735 --> 01:17:22.500
And you say you do not want to be king?

01:17:22.502 --> 01:17:25.003
Will you pledge your metal
to King Vortigern again?

01:17:26.635 --> 01:17:31.966
No, I wish I could.

01:17:31.968 --> 01:17:37.733
Your words have won my
heart, truly they have...

01:17:37.735 --> 01:17:40.336
but it is too late.

01:17:41.769 --> 01:17:44.168
There they are!

01:17:44.170 --> 01:17:46.803
I am so very sorry.

01:17:49.835 --> 01:17:52.369
You are betrayed, Arthfael.

01:17:57.002 --> 01:18:03.770
He offered me riches, Arthfael,
a future for... for my people.

01:18:09.435 --> 01:18:11.902
He wants to watch.

01:18:39.168 --> 01:18:41.900
Kill them both!

01:18:41.902 --> 01:18:43.767
You said nothing of killing!

01:18:43.769 --> 01:18:46.534
You said you would take them
to Dinas Affaraon, to the king!

01:18:46.536 --> 01:18:50.436
Step back! Aberthol has spoken.

01:20:40.903 --> 01:20:45.903
I will not let my people
suffer under the druid's boot!

01:21:01.436 --> 01:21:03.700
- No!
- What are you doing?

01:21:03.702 --> 01:21:07.270
Friend or foe, no Celt should die alone.

01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:11.901
You will soon pass to the other side.

01:21:11.903 --> 01:21:16.666
And all will be peaceful
with you and your ancestors.

01:21:16.668 --> 01:21:22.766
No, not me, I have died in
the service of the druid.

01:21:22.768 --> 01:21:26.065
My soul is sacrificed for Aberthol.

01:21:26.067 --> 01:21:29.901
It will feed the dark god he summons!

01:21:29.903 --> 01:21:34.099
What god? Who does he summon?

01:21:34.101 --> 01:21:38.866
He calls it to the Well of
Annun beneath the stronghold.

01:21:38.868 --> 01:21:42.433
The gateway to the underworld.

01:21:42.435 --> 01:21:45.065
I don't know what god it is...

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:51.902
but I have heard Lucan, he
calls it the stealer of souls.

01:21:57.068 --> 01:21:59.037
I'm afraid...

01:22:14.135 --> 01:22:16.070
Wizard?

01:22:22.468 --> 01:22:24.433
Myrrdin?

01:22:24.435 --> 01:22:30.202
Aberthol is powerful indeed to have
hidden his intent from my visions.

01:22:32.802 --> 01:22:38.534
But I know now why he
lusts so for sacrifice.

01:22:38.536 --> 01:22:45.202
It is said that the offering of 10,000
souls will raise a god from the underworld.

01:22:46.736 --> 01:22:50.166
This is what Aberthol means to do.

01:22:50.168 --> 01:22:54.166
It's why he has killed so many.

01:22:54.168 --> 01:22:59.834
It's why he guides the
Celtic forces to slaughter.

01:22:59.836 --> 01:23:02.567
What god?

01:23:02.569 --> 01:23:07.666
Hafgan, the soul stealer.

01:23:07.668 --> 01:23:11.933
The most fearsome of all the dark gods...

01:23:11.935 --> 01:23:16.834
that fight the forces of
light in the underworld.

01:23:16.836 --> 01:23:23.199
Aberthol believes if he raises
him, Hafgan will be at his command.

01:23:23.201 --> 01:23:25.599
With such a power, the Saxons...

01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:28.533
Aberthol is not in league with the Saxons.

01:23:28.535 --> 01:23:30.666
He does not mean to be on the winning side.

01:23:30.668 --> 01:23:34.767
He means to be the winning side.

01:23:34.769 --> 01:23:38.200
You were right.

01:23:38.202 --> 01:23:44.102
That is why the sword spoke
to you... why it led you to me.

01:23:50.669 --> 01:23:56.634
Man's darkest hour is upon us.

01:23:56.636 --> 01:23:59.766
Know this, warrior.

01:23:59.768 --> 01:24:03.933
Those Aberthol has taken from us...

01:24:03.935 --> 01:24:08.199
those he has sacrificed in
pursuit of his dark purpose.

01:24:08.201 --> 01:24:13.000
Those souls are not free.

01:24:13.002 --> 01:24:18.803
Your friends... my mother...

01:24:20.102 --> 01:24:25.100
the druid has sent them to Hafgan.

01:24:25.102 --> 01:24:28.833
We must destroy this god to set them free!

01:24:28.835 --> 01:24:32.000
I swear to you, we will stop this.

01:24:32.002 --> 01:24:36.533
As will we! You have
opened my eyes, friend.

01:24:36.535 --> 01:24:38.800
My niece has chosen well.

01:24:38.802 --> 01:24:43.434
Whatever your quest's end, we will follow.

01:24:43.436 --> 01:24:46.900
I pledge my metal to
you, Arthfael of Cornwall.

01:24:46.902 --> 01:24:49.434
We march to Dinas Affaraon!

01:24:49.436 --> 01:24:53.866
No... we charge!

01:26:16.602 --> 01:26:18.965
You must commit to the sword.

01:26:18.967 --> 01:26:20.599
We know now why it has been given to you.

01:26:20.601 --> 01:26:22.100
Made by gods, to kill gods.

01:26:22.102 --> 01:26:26.733
It can slay Hafgan. It can
free those souls from his grip.

01:26:26.735 --> 01:26:29.900
It is the sword's destiny, but you
know its bearer has a destiny also.

01:26:29.902 --> 01:26:33.633
I fear the two destinies
cannot be separated.

01:26:33.635 --> 01:26:35.698
They must be achieved
together or not at all.

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:38.766
I mean to free my king, not usurp
him. Nothing will change that.

01:26:38.768 --> 01:26:41.036
Then we will fail.

01:26:43.602 --> 01:26:48.236
Come! Enough rest.

01:27:00.601 --> 01:27:02.803
My king.

01:27:05.068 --> 01:27:07.202
My king.

01:27:08.835 --> 01:27:10.870
My king!

01:27:12.768 --> 01:27:15.199
Olwen?

01:27:15.201 --> 01:27:16.933
I have proof!

01:27:16.935 --> 01:27:22.403
Proof? Of what?

01:27:24.201 --> 01:27:29.567
The king and I have already
warned you against intruding.

01:27:29.569 --> 01:27:36.666
Now you dare to disturb him
again, in these his darkest hours?

01:27:36.668 --> 01:27:41.969
We have lost a mighty battle.
The king grieves for his men.

01:27:43.002 --> 01:27:45.699
You slaughter our people.

01:27:45.701 --> 01:27:50.065
You worship the dark gods!

01:27:50.067 --> 01:27:52.833
He doesn't even hear you anymore.

01:27:52.835 --> 01:27:56.335
Do you, you old fool?

01:28:02.002 --> 01:28:08.969
It is time. Hafgan is almost sated.

01:28:12.135 --> 01:28:16.969
There is a part for you to play.

01:28:31.567 --> 01:28:34.467
I cannot show my face.

01:28:34.469 --> 01:28:36.199
On what terms did you
part the king's service?

01:28:36.201 --> 01:28:41.466
Well... we did not come
to blows... as such.

01:28:41.468 --> 01:28:45.132
But I'm sure the king will receive me
warmly should I make my presence known.

01:28:45.134 --> 01:28:46.699
Then do so.

01:28:46.701 --> 01:28:48.467
We must make our entrance by other means.

01:28:48.469 --> 01:28:51.166
The Well of Annun is
beneath the stronghold.

01:28:51.168 --> 01:28:53.800
There is an entrance to the cave
at the foot of the rock face.

01:28:53.802 --> 01:28:56.102
Then let us go straight
to the heart of this.

01:28:58.534 --> 01:29:00.732
Hello there, friend!

01:29:00.734 --> 01:29:02.565
Who approaches?

01:29:02.567 --> 01:29:07.434
I am Orin of Elfael. I come
to pledge my sword to the king!

01:29:07.436 --> 01:29:10.467
I know of you. You retreated to your lands.

01:29:10.469 --> 01:29:11.966
Withdrew your pledge!

01:29:11.968 --> 01:29:16.866
I did. I have.

01:29:16.868 --> 01:29:19.202
But I changed my mind!

01:29:30.967 --> 01:29:32.769
There.

01:29:56.169 --> 01:30:00.703
There are no magic runes to
light the way here, wizard.

01:30:14.767 --> 01:30:16.699
What did you see?

01:30:16.701 --> 01:30:18.832
A surging fire...

01:30:18.834 --> 01:30:24.566
the sound of... I don't know what.

01:30:24.568 --> 01:30:30.999
Hafgan rises! You see
now what we must fight.

01:30:31.001 --> 01:30:33.766
The sword brought us
together for this purpose...

01:30:33.768 --> 01:30:37.132
for it and its bearer
to fulfill its destiny.

01:30:37.134 --> 01:30:43.499
I will defeat this druid...
and this dark god, but no more.

01:30:43.501 --> 01:30:45.733
You close your mind to your destiny.

01:30:45.735 --> 01:30:47.799
But you know not what we might find.

01:30:47.801 --> 01:30:50.465
You must be prepared for anything!

01:30:50.467 --> 01:30:53.402
It seems I must...

01:30:54.901 --> 01:31:00.598
No one can stop Aberthol. It is over.

01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:04.402
And I have waited a long time for this.

01:31:06.701 --> 01:31:10.835
I'm sorry, warrior. Two against
one is not an even match.

01:31:15.835 --> 01:31:17.732
It would seem your wizard...

01:31:17.734 --> 01:31:20.669
wants you dead as much as I do!

01:31:28.101 --> 01:31:30.633
I thought the cave taught you fairness?

01:31:30.635 --> 01:31:34.068
Well, you taught me fighting.

01:31:47.201 --> 01:31:48.701
Break the seal!

01:31:57.134 --> 01:31:59.833
You have made a tunnel.

01:31:59.835 --> 01:32:03.269
You mean to welcome the Saxons into
the very heart of our homelands!

01:32:05.767 --> 01:32:10.465
You think I'm an ally to Saxon savages?

01:32:10.467 --> 01:32:13.999
I'm already surrounded by brutes.

01:32:14.001 --> 01:32:18.435
I have no desire to swap
one such master for another.

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:22.533
Do not venture too close...

01:32:22.535 --> 01:32:27.033
not if you wish to remain of this world.

01:32:27.035 --> 01:32:30.598
This is the Well of Annun.

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:34.532
Like many things to do with the
old ways, it has been forgotten.

01:32:34.534 --> 01:32:36.100
But it is still...

01:32:36.102 --> 01:32:40.599
Incredibly powerful, a gateway
between here and the underworld.

01:32:40.601 --> 01:32:42.499
One of just a few.

01:32:42.501 --> 01:32:45.599
Aberthol has been in the service
of Dinas Affaraon his entire life.

01:32:45.601 --> 01:32:48.900
He has had decades to
study it and learn its ways.

01:32:48.902 --> 01:32:50.565
And Hafgan will rise through it?

01:32:50.567 --> 01:32:53.733
Hafgan can only rise through
the Well of Annun, it is...

01:32:53.735 --> 01:33:00.698
The only gateway through which a god
may pass from the underworld to here.

01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:04.832
You cannot do this! You will not succeed!

01:33:04.834 --> 01:33:07.966
Will I not?

01:33:07.968 --> 01:33:15.732
With a little help from you, sweet Olwen...

01:33:15.734 --> 01:33:20.200
Hafgan's rise will be unstoppable.

01:33:20.202 --> 01:33:25.065
Unless he is struck down by Nuadu.
Hafgan must feel the sword's metal.

01:33:25.067 --> 01:33:30.800
If he does, you will banish him to the
underworld and free the souls of your friends...

01:33:30.802 --> 01:33:35.433
my mother, and all the other Celts who
have fallen to Aberthol's lust of sacrifice.

01:33:35.435 --> 01:33:38.932
But if you fail to land the blow...

01:33:38.934 --> 01:33:43.733
Hafgan will lay waste to all that
remains of the Celtic nation...

01:33:43.735 --> 01:33:47.865
and perhaps the entire world of men.

01:33:47.867 --> 01:33:52.698
Thank you... for being so... clear.

01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:54.433
You are most welcome.

01:33:55.867 --> 01:33:58.433
Come! We must hurry!

01:33:58.435 --> 01:34:01.666
<i>Sheen-kata wheynoo...</i>

01:34:01.668 --> 01:34:05.702
<i>krra-batka chankos freeykzo.</i>

01:34:09.102 --> 01:34:12.665
Hafgan rises.

01:34:12.667 --> 01:34:16.900
Do not fear, you will
play your part soon enough.

01:34:16.902 --> 01:34:20.732
Now I need Lucan. Where is he?

01:34:20.734 --> 01:34:24.701
Lucan will not be in attendance.

01:34:31.567 --> 01:34:34.136
Show yourself to me!

01:34:40.867 --> 01:34:44.533
I should have killed
you when you were a runt!

01:34:44.535 --> 01:34:48.699
Then you should be glad
of this second chance.

01:34:48.701 --> 01:34:51.465
Aberthol!

01:34:51.467 --> 01:34:52.933
What is this place?

01:34:52.935 --> 01:34:56.032
I thought the king should
see with his own eyes.

01:34:56.034 --> 01:34:57.066
Uncle!

01:34:57.068 --> 01:34:59.166
Put down your weapons!

01:34:59.168 --> 01:35:02.799
There will be no blood spilt
on the soil of our home.

01:35:02.801 --> 01:35:05.132
If you lower your weapons...

01:35:05.134 --> 01:35:09.198
I will cast you down that well into
the underworld for all eternity!

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:14.868
Aberthol, this is insolence!
I told your men to...

01:35:17.935 --> 01:35:19.432
Oh, my king!

01:35:19.434 --> 01:35:21.733
It is futile to try and help.

01:35:21.735 --> 01:35:27.165
His life is now mine to take when I please!

01:35:27.167 --> 01:35:30.198
As I crush the king's beating heart...

01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:32.933
so will I crush all that come before me.

01:35:32.935 --> 01:35:37.932
Saxon and Celt alike, all will fall!

01:35:37.934 --> 01:35:41.132
True order will be restored.

01:35:41.134 --> 01:35:45.000
Druids will be strong again.

01:35:45.002 --> 01:35:51.865
Powerful... and soon all
will worship my dark gods.

01:35:51.867 --> 01:35:54.198
And they'll do it at my feet!

01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:58.033
At the feet of the man who commands Hafgan!

01:35:58.035 --> 01:36:02.899
You've seen this before,
boy. Now watch again.

01:36:02.901 --> 01:36:06.198
As I robbed you of your mother.

01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:12.532
so will I rob the Celts of their father!

01:37:06.868 --> 01:37:08.902
I tire of this.

01:37:16.934 --> 01:37:20.999
- No!
- Stay where you are!

01:37:21.001 --> 01:37:25.900
Hafgan is right at the threshold.

01:37:25.902 --> 01:37:29.031
All that is required now
for him to come forth...

01:37:29.033 --> 01:37:33.000
is one final offering of fresh blood.

01:37:33.002 --> 01:37:35.832
I could simply draw it from your arm...

01:37:35.834 --> 01:37:39.768
but I think I'll take it from your throat!

01:37:41.467 --> 01:37:45.965
Do you try to bend my mind?

01:37:45.967 --> 01:37:50.832
Look at you! You're not
ready for such enchantments.

01:37:50.834 --> 01:37:54.135
He is right, my friend.
You should stop this now!

01:38:01.601 --> 01:38:03.735
Agh!

01:38:09.067 --> 01:38:10.498
What are you doing?

01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:12.198
We must complete the ritual.

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:14.165
We must bring Hafgan
closer in order to slay him.

01:38:14.167 --> 01:38:16.064
You mean to raise a dark god?

01:38:16.066 --> 01:38:19.998
We must. The souls of our dead
lie in eternal torment with Hafgan.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.432
The only way that we can set them
free is if we raise him, and slay him.

01:38:23.434 --> 01:38:24.765
What if you fail?

01:38:24.767 --> 01:38:26.801
We will not fail.

01:38:51.066 --> 01:38:53.699
We must contain Hafgan!

01:38:53.701 --> 01:38:55.998
Keep him at bay until Arthfael can strike!

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.069
Seal the lid!

01:39:08.134 --> 01:39:11.199
It burns! We cannot hold it down!

01:39:11.201 --> 01:39:13.931
Then I will!

01:40:00.635 --> 01:40:03.599
I cannot hold it!

01:40:03.601 --> 01:40:07.036
I cannot withstand another strike!

01:40:09.701 --> 01:40:14.965
Arthfael! The sword! Nuadu!

01:40:14.967 --> 01:40:19.969
You must strike with Nuadu!

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.899
The gods of the air are my sword.

01:41:26.535 --> 01:41:31.832
Arthfael... you saved my life in battle...

01:41:31.834 --> 01:41:35.432
but you cannot save me now.

01:41:35.434 --> 01:41:38.699
You remember.

01:41:38.701 --> 01:41:43.532
I am glad I have my
wits about me, as I die.

01:41:43.534 --> 01:41:47.098
My king, you have saved many
battles, you will survive this one.

01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:53.998
Even in banishment, you did
not give up trying to save me.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.831
The whole kingdom was against you.

01:41:58.833 --> 01:42:04.064
Just imagine what you can do...

01:42:04.066 --> 01:42:10.199
with a whole kingdom behind you.

01:42:10.201 --> 01:42:13.698
All this time without an heir...

01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:20.065
and the perfect choice
stood before my eyes.

01:42:20.067 --> 01:42:22.235
No, my king, you will live.

01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:30.200
No, my king. I am spent.

01:42:44.534 --> 01:42:47.432
I meant to free him.

01:42:47.434 --> 01:42:49.735
You have.

01:42:55.933 --> 01:42:58.234
My king!

01:43:16.001 --> 01:43:17.533
There is no point in delaying.

01:43:17.535 --> 01:43:18.864
I can't. I'm not ready.

01:43:18.866 --> 01:43:23.498
We are never ready, remember?

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:27.032
The only chance we have to
reach our true potential...

01:43:27.034 --> 01:43:31.702
is when we rise to the
challenges that life throws at us.
