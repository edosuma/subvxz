WEBVTT

00:07.218 --> 00:09.554
Looks like we're going
about warp 4.5.

00:09.762 --> 00:12.848
Human children have such
fertile imaginations.

00:13.056 --> 00:14.724
Sub-commander.

00:14.933 --> 00:17.102
These were sent by my nephew's
fourth-grade class.

00:17.310 --> 00:20.479
The crew may like to see how excited
folks at home are about our mission.

00:20.688 --> 00:24.608
I'm going to put this one up in Sickbay.
Would you like one for your quarters?

00:24.817 --> 00:28.444
This rendering is crude,
yet surprisingly accurate.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.655
Some of these kids
are pretty talented.

00:30.863 --> 00:32.738
Which one do you want?

00:32.948 --> 00:35.158
This one's nice.

00:35.367 --> 00:39.371
Or maybe you want First Contact.

00:40.830 --> 00:42.289
Or...

00:43.624 --> 00:45.751
...how about this one?

00:50.213 --> 00:52.257
We're dropping out of warp.

00:55.384 --> 00:58.262
For those of you who aren't near a
window, you might wanna find one.

00:58.470 --> 01:01.557
There's something pretty amazing
of starboard.

01:04.183 --> 01:07.728
Senior staff, please report
to the bridge.

01:08.562 --> 01:11.564
I've checked the Vulcan database, sir.
No previous sightings.

01:11.815 --> 01:15.360
- That means we discovered it.
- "Archer's Comet."

01:16.735 --> 01:19.863
- Take us closer, ensign.
- Aye, sir.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074

01:33.083 --> 01:38.420
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

01:40.881 --> 01:44.301
"It's been a long time"

01:44.510 --> 01:48.346
"But my time is finally near"

01:48.554 --> 01:52.808
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

01:53.016 --> 01:55.936
"I will touch the sky"

01:56.144 --> 01:59.939
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

02:00.147 --> 02:03.150
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

02:03.359 --> 02:08.071
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

02:08.279 --> 02:11.199
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

02:11.407 --> 02:15.994
"I've got faith to believe"

02:16.203 --> 02:18.789
"I can do anything"

02:18.997 --> 02:23.501
"I've got strength of the soul"

02:23.709 --> 02:26.587
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

02:26.796 --> 02:32.133
"I can reach any star"

02:32.509 --> 02:36.262
"I've got faith"

02:36.470 --> 02:40.182
"I've got faith"

02:40.391 --> 02:45.186
"Faith of the heart"

03:00.658 --> 03:03.327
Ever seen anything like that in your
astronomy books?

03:03.535 --> 03:06.746
Wow. That's one big snowball.

03:08.122 --> 03:10.708
The diameter is 82.6 kilometres.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.877
I always wanted to chase a comet.

03:14.086 --> 03:16.546
Maybe we should spend a few days
following this one.

03:16.755 --> 03:20.007
Vulcan and human scientists have
researched hundreds of comets.

03:20.216 --> 03:22.635
They've proven to be little more than
rock and ice.

03:22.885 --> 03:28.223
Except, this one's bigger than any
comet humans have ever seen.

03:28.431 --> 03:31.100
That's gotta be worth a look.

03:31.309 --> 03:33.436
- Stay with it, Travis.
- Aye, sir.

04:15.972 --> 04:18.182
Milk, cold.

04:21.101 --> 04:23.729
- Catching up on your reading?
- I came for tea.

04:23.937 --> 04:25.688
Stay away from the
Zariphean blend,

04:25.897 --> 04:28.483
unless you wanna stay up
for the next three days.

04:28.691 --> 04:31.611
Caffeine has little effect
on Vulcan physiology.

04:31.819 --> 04:34.404
Green tea, hot.

04:39.826 --> 04:42.495
You want to join me?
I could use the company.

04:42.703 --> 04:45.456
- I'm very tired.
- Tell me about it.

04:45.664 --> 04:48.875
Put out about 100 fires in Engineering
this afternoon and missed dinner.

04:49.083 --> 04:51.794
Then somebody told me chef made
a pecan pie,

04:52.003 --> 04:53.588
and suddenly my life brightened.

04:53.796 --> 04:56.632
It's been my favourite
since I was a kid.

04:58.175 --> 05:00.469
- Care for a bite?
- No, thank you.

05:00.677 --> 05:02.762
- It's delicious.
- It's mostly sugar.

05:03.220 --> 05:06.057
What, Vulcans don't have
a sweet tooth?

05:08.476 --> 05:12.270
It may not be good for the body,
but it sure is good for the soul.

05:18.442 --> 05:20.694
I feel better already.

05:22.863 --> 05:25.406
Must be a real page-turner.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.786
You all right?

05:32.996 --> 05:35.290
I'm fine, commander.

05:35.498 --> 05:38.043
Good night.

05:39.001 --> 05:41.086
Sweet dreams.

05:48.176 --> 05:51.554
- Eisilium?
- It's an extremely rare mineral.

05:51.763 --> 05:54.514
This comet appears to contain large
quantities of it.

05:54.723 --> 05:56.308
I've never heard of eisilium.

05:56.516 --> 05:58.477
Vulcan chemists have only obtained
small amounts.

05:58.727 --> 06:01.478
They've never been able to study it
in detail.

06:01.687 --> 06:03.063
This could be your chance.

06:03.272 --> 06:05.107
Can we collect a sample
with the transporter?

06:05.357 --> 06:09.193
Most of the eisilium deposits are at
least 20 metres beneath the crust.

06:09.402 --> 06:13.197
- That's too deep to get a lock.
- We've got the portable drilling rig, sir.

06:13.406 --> 06:17.200
The comet's certainly big enough
to land on. We could take a shuttlepod.

06:17.701 --> 06:20.120
I'd advise setting down near
one of the two poles.

06:20.329 --> 06:23.831
If you're out of direct sunlight,
the surface ice will be more stable.

06:24.498 --> 06:27.376
- How long would you need?
- Shouldn't take more than four hours.

06:27.835 --> 06:29.836
You up for a little comet-walk?

06:31.546 --> 06:35.133
- By all means.
- Get started.

06:37.843 --> 06:41.722
Captain, I'm detecting a vessel
closing on our position.

06:42.598 --> 06:44.974
It's Vulcan.

06:45.892 --> 06:47.852
The starship Ti'Mur.

06:48.060 --> 06:50.354
Hail them.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.191
This is Captain Jonathan Archer
of the starship Enterprise.

06:55.608 --> 06:59.069
- I'm Captain Vanik.
- Pleased to meet you.

06:59.403 --> 07:02.906
You're a long way from Earth, captain.
Are you lost?

07:04.324 --> 07:07.827
Not at all. Just taking a look
at this comet.

07:08.286 --> 07:13.331
Our sensors detected it two days ago.
We also decided to investigate.

07:14.166 --> 07:15.792
Really?

07:16.501 --> 07:18.670
My science officer tells me
that Vulcans

07:18.920 --> 07:20.379
aren't very interested in comets.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.508
Actually, it's your interest in the
comet we're investigating.

07:26.176 --> 07:30.555
We plan to send a drilling team to
the surface to collect core samples.

07:30.805 --> 07:32.307
You're welcome to participate.

07:32.515 --> 07:36.268
If you have no objection,
we'd like to remain here and observe.

07:37.436 --> 07:40.021
Stay as long as you want.

07:43.441 --> 07:45.693
T'Pol.

07:54.284 --> 07:58.328
I'd love to know what they're really
doing here.

07:58.579 --> 08:02.416
You don't find anything strange
about them suddenly showing up?

08:02.874 --> 08:06.627
- Perhaps they're simply curious.
- Curious?

08:07.169 --> 08:09.797
That doesn't sound very
Vulcan to me.

08:10.589 --> 08:13.883
This isn't the first time we've caught
them lurking around.

08:14.092 --> 08:16.928
Remember three weeks ago,
the planetary nebula?

08:17.137 --> 08:19.763
That was nothing more
than a survey ship.

08:19.972 --> 08:22.057
So why didn't they respond
to our hails?

08:22.307 --> 08:25.144
Why'd they go to warp when we
headed toward them?

08:25.351 --> 08:28.646
I'm starting to get the feeling they're
looking over our shoulder

08:28.855 --> 08:32.567
- a little too often.
- That seems unlikely.

08:32.774 --> 08:34.609
We'll see.

08:34.818 --> 08:36.570
Fine.

08:36.778 --> 08:40.698
If Vanik is the kind of guy
who likes to watch...

08:42.241 --> 08:44.618
...let him.

08:57.796 --> 08:59.923
I've never stood on a comet before.

09:00.173 --> 09:03.759
- Has anyone?
- Good question.

09:03.968 --> 09:06.345
I've only seen snow twice in my life.

09:06.595 --> 09:08.972
Then it's only fitting that we
commemorate the occasion.

09:09.180 --> 09:12.475
- You mean plant a flag?
- No, too predictable.

09:12.684 --> 09:13.977
Snowball fight?

09:14.769 --> 09:17.938
EV suits would take all the fun
out of that.

09:18.772 --> 09:22.609
We'll just have to see how the spirit
moves us when we get there.

10:00.474 --> 10:05.229
- Commander, you wanted to see me?
- Take a look at something, will you?

10:05.437 --> 10:07.022
I've been running diagnostics

10:07.230 --> 10:10.066
and I found some kind of power surge
in the transceiver array.

10:10.274 --> 10:12.944
Looks like an encrypted transmission.

10:18.573 --> 10:21.159
It came from the Vulcan ship.

10:21.368 --> 10:23.244
Who was it sent to?

10:26.872 --> 10:28.749
You're sure this was sent
to her quarters?

10:28.957 --> 10:30.917
I wish I wasn't.

10:31.125 --> 10:33.795
Did she say anything to you
about it?

10:34.003 --> 10:38.298
Not a word. We had an agreement.

10:39.007 --> 10:41.927
She promised not to speak to the
Vulcans without telling me.

10:42.886 --> 10:46.055
Looks like she's having some trouble
keeping her promises.

10:46.722 --> 10:49.058
Should I have Hoshi decrypt it?

10:52.852 --> 10:55.271
Tell her it's top priority.

11:04.071 --> 11:06.614
Whenever you're ready, captain.

11:06.822 --> 11:10.660
You sure you want me here for this?
I've got a lot of work to do.

11:10.868 --> 11:14.621
Stay put, commander.
This is important.

11:19.125 --> 11:21.460
Start the recording.

11:23.379 --> 11:26.173
To the students of Ms Malvin's
fourth-grade class

11:26.382 --> 11:29.488
at the Worley Elementary School

11:29.489 --> 11:32.595
in Kenmare, County Kerry, Ireland.

11:32.804 --> 11:36.765
This is Captain Archer aboard
the starship Enterprise.

11:36.973 --> 11:42.603
On behalf of the entire crew, I'd like
to thank you for your transmission.

11:42.811 --> 11:46.982
We all got a real kick out of your
drawings and letters.

11:47.191 --> 11:49.484
You asked a lot of interesting
questions.

11:49.692 --> 11:52.528
I wish we had time to answer all
of them, but if we did that,

11:52.737 --> 11:54.781
we wouldn't get much
exploring done.

11:55.031 --> 11:59.493
So I've selected a few, and hopefully
our answers will give you

11:59.701 --> 12:03.454
a better idea of what life
is like out here.

12:04.622 --> 12:09.251
Liam Brennan asks,
"What do you eat?"

12:09.460 --> 12:12.796
For the most part,
the same things you eat at home.

12:13.004 --> 12:17.050
Our chef can make anything from
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,

12:17.258 --> 12:20.719
to turkey with all the trimmings.

12:20.928 --> 12:23.680
We have a
hydroponic greenhouse onboard

12:23.889 --> 12:25.306
where we grow fruits
and vegetables,

12:25.514 --> 12:31.187
and we can also replicate certain foods
with our protein resequencer.

12:32.937 --> 12:36.608
Here's one from Geoff Miles.

12:37.525 --> 12:39.444
"Is dating allowed on Enterprise?"

12:39.652 --> 12:42.739
Well, it's not discouraged,

12:42.874 --> 12:46.116
but there isn't a lot
of privacy on a starship.

12:46.325 --> 12:48.826
Most of our crew share quarters
with at least one other person,

12:49.035 --> 12:54.498
so it wouldn't... exactly be practical.

12:55.207 --> 12:59.669
But if two crewmembers decide
that they really like each other,

12:59.878 --> 13:03.589
there are a lot of places they can go
to look at the stars.

13:04.632 --> 13:09.302
Chloe O'Shannon wants to know,
"How do we talk to aliens?"

13:09.510 --> 13:12.555
I think I'll give that one to my
communications officer,

13:12.764 --> 13:15.350
Ensign Hoshi Sato.

13:16.516 --> 13:19.436
Well, Chloe, that's a very
good question.

13:19.644 --> 13:22.314
We use a device called
the universal translator.

13:22.522 --> 13:25.274
It's like an alien dictionary
with hundreds of languages

13:25.483 --> 13:29.862
programmed into it, and it can learn
new languages very quickly...

13:30.571 --> 13:33.239
...but it doesn't always work,
and when that happens,

13:33.448 --> 13:35.200
it's up to me to try to translate.

13:35.408 --> 13:38.410
I'm sure I don't have to tell you it can
be really hard sometimes.

13:38.619 --> 13:41.747
One wrong word can mean
the difference between saying:

13:41.955 --> 13:44.791
"Take my hand" or "Take my life."

13:45.000 --> 13:47.543
So far, I have managed
to do pretty well.

13:47.752 --> 13:49.420
Thanks, Hoshi.

13:49.670 --> 13:52.381
Here's one from Molly McCook.

13:53.298 --> 13:56.051
"When you flush the toilet,
where does it go?"

13:56.593 --> 13:59.721
That sounds like an engineering
question.

13:59.970 --> 14:04.308
So we'll ask Commander Charles
Tucker, our chief engineer.

14:06.310 --> 14:08.352
Trip.

14:08.561 --> 14:10.980
Pause it, will you?

14:12.356 --> 14:15.233
A poop question, sir?

14:15.442 --> 14:18.111
Can't I talk about the warp reactor
or the transporter?

14:18.320 --> 14:20.822
It's a perfectly valid question.

14:27.494 --> 14:29.454
The first thing you've
gotta understand is

14:29.662 --> 14:32.623
we recycle pretty much everything
on a starship.

14:32.832 --> 14:35.585
That includes... waste.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.879
And the first thing that happens
to the waste

14:39.087 --> 14:44.884
is it gets processed through a machine
called a bio-matter resequencer.

14:45.092 --> 14:48.012
Then it gets broken down into...

14:48.846 --> 14:50.514
Hold on.

14:51.681 --> 14:54.642
They're gonna think
I'm the sanitation engineer.

14:54.851 --> 14:57.395
You're doing fine.

15:00.188 --> 15:03.775
So the waste is broken down
into little molecules.

15:03.984 --> 15:08.070
They get transformed into any number
of things we can use on the ship.

15:08.279 --> 15:12.866
Cargo containers, insulation, boots.

15:14.117 --> 15:16.161
You name it.

15:17.871 --> 15:20.497
Very enlightening, commander.

15:22.583 --> 15:27.295
Gabrielle Witty wants to know if germs
can live in space.

15:28.254 --> 15:31.173
I believe I can answer that, captain.

15:32.216 --> 15:36.595
Hello, children. I'm Dr Phlox,
the ship's physician.

15:36.803 --> 15:39.848
I'm from a system called
Denobula Triaxa,

15:40.056 --> 15:44.018
and I feel very honoured to be
part of this important mission.

15:44.226 --> 15:46.061
Germs.

15:46.270 --> 15:49.022
They may be tiny, but they are among
the most resilient organisms

15:49.230 --> 15:52.024
known to medical science.
They can survive almost anywhere,

15:52.233 --> 15:54.569
on your kitchen counter,
under your fingernail,

15:55.027 --> 15:56.528
in the vacuum of space.

15:56.736 --> 16:01.032
Over 200 million space-dwelling
microbes have been catalogued.

16:01.241 --> 16:05.244
One of the most virulent species lives
inside grains of interstellar dust.

16:05.452 --> 16:07.496
Polycocyx astris.

16:07.705 --> 16:10.999
They can drift in a dormant state
for millions of years

16:11.207 --> 16:14.502
and still cause a nasty cold.

16:14.794 --> 16:20.590
I once discovered a peculiar colony
of spores on a hull of...

16:20.799 --> 16:23.760
Thank you, doctor. Fascinating.

16:23.969 --> 16:28.472
I think we've taken up enough
of Ms Malvin's classroom time.

16:28.681 --> 16:33.143
By the way, we've included some
pictures of a comet we're studying.

16:33.351 --> 16:35.019
We think it might be the biggest one

16:35.228 --> 16:38.439
ever discovered by humans
or Vulcans.

16:38.648 --> 16:40.941
That's what so exciting about being
on Enterprise.

16:41.150 --> 16:44.194
You never know what you're
gonna find next.

16:45.904 --> 16:47.780
We miss Earth.

16:47.989 --> 16:52.410
But hearing from you makes us all feel
a little closer to home.

16:52.618 --> 16:55.787
Captain Archer, out.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.333
How'd it go?

17:05.462 --> 17:08.757
The beauty of ice is that it records
everything like a blank page.

17:08.964 --> 17:13.594
The farther down you drill,
the farther back in time you go.

17:15.012 --> 17:17.347
- Lieutenant.
- Yes?

17:17.556 --> 17:19.641
What do you think?

17:25.938 --> 17:28.190
Hand me the plasma torch.

17:46.705 --> 17:49.834
- Archer to Lieutenant Reed.
- Go ahead, sir.

17:50.042 --> 17:52.836
- How are you doing, Malcolm?
- We're just about to set the charges.

17:53.086 --> 17:54.462
I'm sure I don't need to remind you

17:54.671 --> 17:57.298
- we're being observed.
- No, sir.

17:57.507 --> 17:59.842
We want this to go as smoothly
as possible.

18:00.092 --> 18:02.427
- Make a good impression.
- Right.

18:02.636 --> 18:05.639
So tell me, who's the sculptor?

18:07.723 --> 18:09.392
It won't be there for long, sir.

18:10.893 --> 18:12.520
Archer out.

18:17.065 --> 18:19.025
- Any luck?
- Sorry it took so long.

18:19.234 --> 18:20.902
The code was pretty complex.

18:21.111 --> 18:22.820
- What's it say?
- It's in Vulcan.

18:23.028 --> 18:25.781
You'll have to run it through
the translation matrix.

18:25.989 --> 18:29.826
- You didn't read it?
- I didn't feel it'd be right.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.745
Thanks.

18:51.135 --> 18:53.346
Come in.

18:54.389 --> 18:57.933
Well, we decrypted the message.

18:58.141 --> 18:59.935
And?

19:00.143 --> 19:05.148
It's not exactly what we expected.
It's a letter.

19:05.397 --> 19:08.776
- What did it say?
- It's personal.

19:08.984 --> 19:12.695
- What do you mean?
- Very personal.

19:13.363 --> 19:16.032
You could order me to tell you,
but you wouldn't be happy if I did.

19:16.241 --> 19:19.118
- Why the hell was it encrypted?
- That's what I wanna know.

19:19.327 --> 19:21.745
Maybe Vulcans encrypt all their
personal letters.

19:21.954 --> 19:25.582
All they had to do was send it through
regular channels, mark it personal,

19:25.791 --> 19:29.043
and we'd have left it alone.
But no, they had to encrypt it,

19:29.251 --> 19:31.003
force me to start snooping.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.756
I feel like I got caught with my hand
in the cookie jar.

19:34.964 --> 19:37.342
Let it go, Trip.

19:38.009 --> 19:43.138
- Come on, it was an honest mistake.
- I can't let it go.

19:45.140 --> 19:47.100
I gotta tell her.

19:47.309 --> 19:51.270
- How's that gonna help?
- It's the right thing to do.

19:51.479 --> 19:55.733
At least I'll be able to look her
in the eye without feeling guilty.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.986
You're a good man.

20:02.822 --> 20:05.908
You might wanna take a phase pistol
with you.

20:06.158 --> 20:08.494
I might need one.

20:19.753 --> 20:21.880
Got a minute?

20:23.173 --> 20:25.091
In private?

20:25.299 --> 20:27.551
Excuse us, crewman.

20:32.889 --> 20:34.432
Did you ever...?

20:36.851 --> 20:41.271
Did you ever do anything totally
by mistake that...

20:41.980 --> 20:43.649
...you weren't very proud of?

20:44.983 --> 20:47.109
No.

20:48.944 --> 20:53.699
Did you ever come across something
that you thought was one thing,

20:53.908 --> 20:57.994
so you reacted in a certain way,
but then it turned out

20:58.203 --> 21:01.872
- to be something completely different?
- Your point, commander?

21:04.333 --> 21:07.711
I found out about your message
from the Vulcan ship.

21:09.754 --> 21:11.464
It was a personal matter.

21:11.714 --> 21:13.841
Why wasn't it sent through normal
Starfleet channels?

21:14.050 --> 21:17.052
That takes time.
The letter was important.

21:17.260 --> 21:19.846
So they sent it in code?

21:20.430 --> 21:24.516
Do you have any idea how suspicious
that looked?

21:25.434 --> 21:27.770
You read my letter?

21:27.978 --> 21:30.522
Believe me, I don't feel very good
about it.

21:31.105 --> 21:34.567
I have more letters in my quarters.
Would you like to read those as well?

21:36.694 --> 21:39.112
I'm trying to apologize here.

21:39.321 --> 21:42.032
- Archer to T'Pol.
- Yes, captain.

21:42.240 --> 21:44.743
Please report to my Ready Room.

21:46.619 --> 21:50.289
- Has anyone else read the letter?
- No.

21:52.041 --> 21:54.334
I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't mention it.

21:54.876 --> 21:56.836
I won't. I promise.

22:03.300 --> 22:06.511
I thought I'd invite Captain Vanik
for a visit.

22:06.720 --> 22:09.263
If he's so interested in how
we do things,

22:09.472 --> 22:11.807
he might as well come see
for himself.

22:12.016 --> 22:15.894
Once he realizes we're not gonna
blow up the galaxy,

22:16.102 --> 22:18.271
maybe he'll leave us alone.

22:18.521 --> 22:21.274
I'm sure he'll appreciate the gesture.

22:21.482 --> 22:23.525
Dinner's a good way
to break the ice.

22:23.734 --> 22:27.404
I was hoping you might give chef
some menu suggestions.

22:27.613 --> 22:31.324
- Certainly.
- A little food, a little wine...

22:31.866 --> 22:35.077
- Vulcans don't drink wine.
- You know what I mean.

22:35.286 --> 22:38.872
Just help me make him go away.

22:43.126 --> 22:46.920
- When did these symptoms begin?
- Two days ago.

22:47.129 --> 22:48.756
Perhaps you slept
in an awkward position.

22:48.964 --> 22:51.215
I haven't slept.

22:51.799 --> 22:53.759
For two days?

22:53.968 --> 22:56.053
Something on your mind?

22:57.472 --> 23:00.265
It appears to be a tension headache.

23:01.057 --> 23:04.728
You know, anything said between us
is strictly confidential.

23:04.936 --> 23:08.230
Would you like to talk about
what's troubling you?

23:08.439 --> 23:10.190
No.

23:10.441 --> 23:13.526
I don't know if there's anyone on this
ship you'd feel comfortable talking to,

23:13.735 --> 23:15.111
but if there is, it might feel good

23:15.320 --> 23:18.031
to get whatever's bothering
you out in the open.

23:24.661 --> 23:26.747
This is a simple analgesic.

23:26.955 --> 23:30.708
I can give you something later to help
you sleep this evening, if you'd like.

23:32.209 --> 23:34.294
Thank you, doctor.

24:12.910 --> 24:15.496
The ears are a nice touch.

24:15.705 --> 24:17.956
I thought so.

24:18.915 --> 24:20.834
We should get out more often.

24:21.042 --> 24:22.877
Don't get too comfortable.

24:23.086 --> 24:26.130
This landscape is about to change.

24:27.881 --> 24:30.175
- Reed to Enterprise.
- Go ahead.

24:30.384 --> 24:33.511
- Charges are set.
- Stand by.

24:34.679 --> 24:37.682
Inform the Vulcans we're about
to make a very loud noise.

24:37.932 --> 24:39.392
Aye, sir.

24:40.767 --> 24:42.936
- Archer to Reed.
- Yes, captain.

24:43.145 --> 24:46.231
- Blast away.
- Understood.

25:07.249 --> 25:08.916
Impressive.

25:10.751 --> 25:13.629
I was hoping for a little
more symmetry.

25:13.838 --> 25:15.840
I'll get the drill.

25:30.561 --> 25:34.105
If I'm not mistaken,
you're flying a Surak-class ship.

25:34.313 --> 25:36.524
You're not mistaken.

25:36.732 --> 25:40.151
You can get her up to what,
6, 6.5?

25:40.360 --> 25:41.653
Six-point-five.

25:41.861 --> 25:44.072
I'd love to get a look inside
those nacelles.

25:44.281 --> 25:47.324
Our warp systems are classified.

25:51.537 --> 25:57.208
A few years back, I was a guest
aboard a Maymora-class ship.

25:57.417 --> 26:00.502
The Yarahla. Captain Tok.
Do you know him?

26:00.710 --> 26:02.796
- Not personally.
- Oh.

26:03.004 --> 26:05.757
We made a run
to a dark-matter nebula.

26:05.966 --> 26:08.384
I helped set up
the graviton telescope.

26:08.592 --> 26:10.219
Most fun I've ever had
on a space walk.

26:10.427 --> 26:12.346
Those Vulcan EV suits
are something else,

26:12.555 --> 26:15.848
like you're flying around inside
your own little starship.

26:16.057 --> 26:18.518
You're easily impressed.

26:26.858 --> 26:29.527
Something wrong
with your Pok Tar?

26:29.735 --> 26:31.070
No.

26:33.364 --> 26:38.118
If it's not to your liking, I'm sure our
chef can prepare you something else.

26:38.368 --> 26:40.870
I've already eaten.

26:41.663 --> 26:43.622
Hope you saved room for dessert.

26:54.382 --> 26:59.761
After dinner... I thought you might
like to take a look around.

26:59.970 --> 27:04.974
Enterprise may not be Surak-class,
but she's quite a ship.

27:05.182 --> 27:07.559
Perhaps another time.

27:09.103 --> 27:11.980
- Tea?
- I only drink water.

27:14.315 --> 27:15.817
You know...

27:16.400 --> 27:20.695
...for people who claim to not be
explorers, you sure do get around.

27:20.904 --> 27:23.698
I hope our presence here
is not proving inconvenient.

27:23.907 --> 27:28.285
On the contrary. It's nice to know
no matter how big the universe is,

27:28.494 --> 27:31.497
there's always a Vulcan ship nearby.

27:34.207 --> 27:39.712
- So, captain, tell us about yourself.
- Excuse me?

27:39.962 --> 27:43.173
On Earth, it's customary to exchange
personal information

27:43.382 --> 27:45.258
with someone you've just met.

27:45.509 --> 27:49.303
We have this peculiar habit
of actually talking during meals.

27:49.512 --> 27:51.722
I've noticed.

27:52.765 --> 27:55.226
What would you like to know?

27:55.434 --> 27:57.894
I don't know. Where were you born?

27:58.102 --> 28:02.315
How long have you been captain?
Any hobbies?

28:02.774 --> 28:05.984
I've served in the Vulcan space
program for 76 years,

28:06.193 --> 28:08.403
fifteen of those commanding
the Ti'Mur.

28:08.654 --> 28:13.449
I believe this is Captain Vanik's first
visit aboard an Earth vessel.

28:14.283 --> 28:19.245
We'd be happy to answer any
questions you might have.

28:19.454 --> 28:24.417
I have none. Humans have never held
much interest for me.

28:30.672 --> 28:32.049
Well...

28:32.799 --> 28:36.302
...where did the time go?
Seems like you just got here.

28:36.719 --> 28:38.721
I'm sure you're eager to get back
to your ship,

28:38.930 --> 28:41.765
so I'll trouble you with just
one last question.

28:42.474 --> 28:45.101
How long do you plan
on spying on us?

28:45.852 --> 28:49.379
If we were spying, captain,

28:49.780 --> 28:52.107
you would have never
detected our presence.

28:52.358 --> 28:56.944
Your inexperience and your arrogance
are your enemies, not us.

29:03.492 --> 29:06.078
Please show Captain Vanik
to the launch bay.

29:18.588 --> 29:20.965
What'd he say?

29:34.393 --> 29:37.271
Captain, you should take
a look at this.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.454
Archer to Lieutenant Reed.

29:56.662 --> 29:58.873
- Go ahead, sir.
- How's it going?

29:59.081 --> 30:02.500
We hit a layer of magnesite and
cracked a drill bit, but we've replaced it.

30:02.709 --> 30:05.295
- You may wanna pick up the pace.
- Sir?

30:05.503 --> 30:09.423
The comet's rotational axis shifted
when you set of those charges.

30:09.632 --> 30:14.510
In about two hours, the shuttlepod
will be facing the star.

30:14.761 --> 30:17.055
The temperature will shoot up
by a couple hundred degrees.

30:17.263 --> 30:18.848
I want you out of there before then.

30:19.098 --> 30:22.309
- We'll be done with time to spare, sir.
- Be sure you are.

30:22.517 --> 30:24.060
Archer out.

30:30.399 --> 30:32.151
Come in.

30:34.069 --> 30:36.154
You decide to tell me
what Vanik said?

30:36.821 --> 30:38.698
Please, sit down.

30:41.868 --> 30:44.536
I've never seen your quarters before.

30:44.745 --> 30:46.246
Cosy.

30:47.998 --> 30:50.833
You know you're not supposed to
have an open flame on the ship.

30:51.042 --> 30:53.169
I was given permission
from the captain.

30:53.377 --> 30:54.837
They're for meditation.

30:57.173 --> 30:59.799
So, what can I do for you?

31:00.425 --> 31:04.762
Dr Phlox believes that it might help
if I was to discuss my problem

31:04.971 --> 31:08.473
with someone I felt comfortable
confiding in.

31:08.682 --> 31:11.226
You wanna talk to me?

31:13.936 --> 31:18.649
Well, I'm not sure I'm gonna
be much help.

31:18.858 --> 31:21.026
I mean, I've only been in three
relationships,

31:21.234 --> 31:23.403
and they all went bust.

31:23.612 --> 31:26.406
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
talk to Hoshi or Ensign Kimball?

31:26.614 --> 31:29.867
- She's married.
- You were far from my first choice.

31:30.617 --> 31:32.327
But speaking with someone else

31:32.578 --> 31:35.037
would mean more people knowing
about my situation.

31:37.165 --> 31:40.543
I'll do anything I can.
What's your problem?

31:40.751 --> 31:43.378
- You read the letter.
- Yes.

31:43.587 --> 31:47.090
Then you know that unless I leave
Enterprise immediately,

31:47.299 --> 31:49.341
my wedding plans will be cancelled.

31:51.385 --> 31:53.929
- Have you talked to...?
- Koss.

31:54.138 --> 31:56.306
Have you talked to Koss
about all this?

31:56.514 --> 31:59.058
We haven't spoken in many years.

31:59.267 --> 32:02.395
Marriages on Vulcan are arranged
during childhood.

32:02.603 --> 32:05.647
I've only met Koss four times.

32:06.189 --> 32:08.734
How can you be in love with a guy
you've only met four times?

32:08.984 --> 32:12.862
It's assumed that we'd eventually
develop an affection for one another.

32:14.572 --> 32:17.658
So his parents send you
an ultimatum?

32:17.866 --> 32:20.785
- He doesn't have a say?
- His parents planned the union.

32:20.994 --> 32:23.413
It's their decision.

32:23.621 --> 32:24.956
Boy.

32:25.581 --> 32:28.709
Where I come from, arranged
marriages went out with slavery.

32:28.917 --> 32:32.837
Are you going to give me advice
or criticize my people's tradition?

32:33.045 --> 32:36.632
I'm still fuzzy on why they threatened
to call it off in the first place.

32:36.882 --> 32:40.176
The ceremony was supposed
to take place next week.

32:40.385 --> 32:42.220
When I decided to remain
on Enterprise,

32:42.429 --> 32:44.180
I requested a postponement.

32:44.389 --> 32:47.057
Koss' parents were insulted
that I would put off our plans

32:47.266 --> 32:50.018
to serve on a human vessel.

32:50.936 --> 32:52.604
Well, Vanik can take you home.

32:52.813 --> 32:55.231
Why don't you go marry Koss,
then come back?

32:55.481 --> 32:58.025
It's customary for a husband and wife
to reside together

32:58.234 --> 33:00.444
for at least one Vulcan year.

33:00.653 --> 33:03.029
- Maybe he can come to Enterprise.
- He's an architect.

33:03.238 --> 33:06.867
It would be illogical for him to live
aboard a starship.

33:07.075 --> 33:09.910
This whole thing sounds illogical.

33:10.119 --> 33:12.329
Your advice, commander.

33:14.581 --> 33:17.292
- What do you wanna do?
- That is irrelevant.

33:17.500 --> 33:20.795
No, it's not. It's very relevant.

33:21.004 --> 33:23.296
Do you wanna go back
and marry this guy,

33:23.505 --> 33:26.425
spend a year with him,
ten years, 100 years?

33:26.633 --> 33:28.301
Or do you wanna
stay on Enterprise?

33:28.552 --> 33:32.805
- I have an obligation.
- You've got an obligation to yourself.

33:33.055 --> 33:34.765
You've spent the last year
around humans.

33:35.015 --> 33:38.268
One thing you should've learned is that
we're free to make our own decisions.

33:38.476 --> 33:40.270
There's a lot to be said
for personal choice.

33:40.478 --> 33:43.106
If you'd spent the last year on Vulcan,
you would've learned

33:43.314 --> 33:46.525
that our commitment to tradition
outweighs personal choice.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.819
I respect your customs.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.822
But this marriage was arranged
when you were a kid.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.115
A lot's happened since then.
People change.

33:54.365 --> 33:56.826
- Vulcans don't.
- Really?

33:57.034 --> 34:00.537
My obligation is to my culture,
my heritage.

34:00.745 --> 34:03.623
It has to take precedence.

34:05.291 --> 34:07.626
Sounds to me like you already
made up your mind.

34:09.378 --> 34:11.170
Why the hell did you ask me here?

34:12.130 --> 34:14.007
It was a mistake.

34:14.465 --> 34:16.592
I apologize.

34:21.679 --> 34:24.431
Did it ever occur to you that you
might've postponed the wedding

34:24.641 --> 34:26.726
because subconsciously you wanted
to get out of it?

34:27.226 --> 34:29.186
That would imply that my
subconscious mind

34:29.395 --> 34:32.563
controls my decisions.
It doesn't.

34:34.149 --> 34:36.525
Well, it happens to humans
all the time.

34:36.734 --> 34:39.696
Maybe you're picking up some
of our bad habits.

35:02.549 --> 35:03.800
Travis!

35:09.096 --> 35:10.931
I'm okay.

35:14.141 --> 35:16.811
- What?
- My knee.

35:17.687 --> 35:19.687
You rest here.

35:19.896 --> 35:23.108
- I'm all right.
- Okay.

35:23.316 --> 35:24.859
Well, let's get you to the pod.

35:25.068 --> 35:27.152
I'll come back for the gear
if there's time.

35:27.361 --> 35:28.737
At least take the core sample.

35:28.946 --> 35:31.532
We shouldn't go back to the ship
empty-handed.

35:43.541 --> 35:45.502
Almost there.

35:45.710 --> 35:50.923
- It might be faster without the suits.
- Yes, and a lot colder.

36:10.898 --> 36:12.816
What's that?

36:50.140 --> 36:52.893
I hope I never see snow again.

37:46.313 --> 37:48.398
You all right?

37:50.317 --> 37:52.027
We should have never ignited
the thrusters.

37:52.235 --> 37:54.737
Well, it's not like we had a choice.

38:04.662 --> 38:06.748
- Reed here.
- You two okay?

38:06.955 --> 38:09.666
More or less.
How far did we drop?

38:09.917 --> 38:13.420
About 18 metres. We'll get you out
of there. Just give us a few minutes.

38:13.629 --> 38:15.796
We're not going anywhere.

38:16.213 --> 38:18.591
Bring the grappler online.

38:18.799 --> 38:20.593
The mouth of that chasm's
a little narrow.

38:20.843 --> 38:23.094
I'll get you in close enough.

38:37.690 --> 38:41.360
- Do you see them?
- Bring us in another 50 metres.

38:43.320 --> 38:45.113
Two metres starboard.

38:48.199 --> 38:49.492
A little more.

38:52.786 --> 38:56.248
- The Vulcan ship's hailing us.
- Take a message. I'm busy.

38:56.874 --> 38:59.751
Captain Vanik wants to know if we
require assistance.

39:00.001 --> 39:03.004
Tell him we've got everything
under control.

39:04.338 --> 39:07.883
There. Right there.
Synchronize to the rotation.

39:17.183 --> 39:19.351
Almost got it.

39:30.527 --> 39:31.945
One hit, one miss.

39:33.530 --> 39:35.948
One will be fine. Reel them in.

39:45.999 --> 39:49.126
The pod's hit an outcropping.
It's wedged in.

39:49.334 --> 39:51.003
Take us a few metres to port.

39:51.253 --> 39:53.881
We might be able
to pull them around it.

39:58.384 --> 40:01.304
Those eisilium deposits are disrupting
the maglock. I'm losing them.

40:01.679 --> 40:03.597
Ease them back down.

40:16.608 --> 40:19.944
- They've fallen another nine metres.
- Let's try it again.

40:20.153 --> 40:23.781
They're moving out of the sunlight.
The surface ice is recrystallizing.

40:23.990 --> 40:26.283
In less than an hour, that chasm
will be sealed up again.

40:26.533 --> 40:27.993
Then we'd better hurry.

40:28.201 --> 40:30.203
There is another option.

40:30.454 --> 40:33.038
- Captain Vanik.
- I'd rather leave him out of this.

40:33.247 --> 40:36.876
His ship has a tractor beam that won't
be affected by the eisilium.

40:37.084 --> 40:38.586
Reset the grappler.

40:43.673 --> 40:46.759
Vanik offered to assist us.
There's no shame in accepting.

40:47.009 --> 40:48.719
We can do this on our own.

40:48.927 --> 40:51.346
I don't like him any more
than you do, captain.

40:51.555 --> 40:54.682
But a tractor beam sounds like a pretty
good idea right now.

40:54.932 --> 41:00.855
Vanik expects you to refuse his offer.
He sees humans as arrogant, prideful.

41:01.438 --> 41:03.189
Why not prove him wrong?

41:03.773 --> 41:08.236
You can save them, or you can
let your pride stand in the way.

41:08.652 --> 41:10.362
You're human.

41:10.571 --> 41:12.865
You're free to choose.

41:20.913 --> 41:22.957
They've got us.

41:24.666 --> 41:26.376
Go ahead, Enterprise.

41:26.584 --> 41:29.337
This is Captain Vanik
of the Vulcan ship Ti'Mur.

41:29.546 --> 41:33.340
Stand by to ignite your engines
and return to your ship.

41:46.726 --> 41:49.646
I thought you might wanna take a look
at the data we collected.

41:49.855 --> 41:52.398
You helped us bring it back.
It's the least we can do.

41:52.606 --> 41:56.944
As your science oficer told you,
we have little interest in comets.

41:59.196 --> 42:01.572
That tractor beam of yours
is quite something.

42:01.781 --> 42:05.034
Any chance we could take a look
at the specifications?

42:05.285 --> 42:07.452
That information is classified.

42:08.578 --> 42:10.122
I thought it might be.

42:10.372 --> 42:11.998
We'll be leaving within the hour.

42:12.207 --> 42:14.417
Is there anything else
we can help you with?

42:16.377 --> 42:18.212
You've done more than enough.

42:20.256 --> 42:21.631
See you around.

42:27.679 --> 42:30.180
You don't have much time.

42:31.765 --> 42:33.392
I assume you're all packed.

42:35.310 --> 42:38.729
Captain, with your permission,
I'd like to transmit a message

42:38.938 --> 42:41.607
to the Ti'Mur, to send to Vulcan.

42:43.025 --> 42:44.359
Go right ahead.

42:45.068 --> 42:46.569
Thank you.

42:58.538 --> 42:59.997
What was that all about?

43:01.290 --> 43:03.167
It's personal.
