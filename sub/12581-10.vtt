00:34.489 --> 00:38.858
If I wasn't stealing

00:38.893 --> 00:40.121
so much beer
from this place

00:40.161 --> 00:41.287
I'd totally quit.

00:41.329 --> 00:43.354
Yeah, we should build
our own MegaloMart.

00:43.398 --> 00:46.595
Call it, like... CooloMart.

00:46.635 --> 00:48.626
Blue vest, incoming.

00:48.670 --> 00:53.437
(workers chanting):
Who's the lowest?

00:53.475 --> 00:55.841
We're the lowest!

00:55.877 --> 00:56.844
Megalo-team!

00:56.878 --> 00:58.243
Megalo-fun!
Megalo-sucks.

00:58.280 --> 00:59.975
Exercises, huh?

01:00.015 --> 01:01.073
I got to tell you, Norm

01:01.116 --> 01:03.084
when MegaloMart
first came to town

01:03.118 --> 01:04.709
I hated it, but
I got to admit

01:04.753 --> 01:07.722
I like buying my hammers
and pants at the same store

01:07.756 --> 01:09.724
so I can see how
they look together.

01:09.758 --> 01:10.884
Glad we won you over, Hank.

01:10.925 --> 01:12.893
Since you been handling
our propane

01:12.927 --> 01:14.895
I don't have
to spend time checking

01:14.929 --> 01:16.897
to see if the tanks
are really filled.

01:16.931 --> 01:19.263
That's why I call you
"Full Tank Hank," Hank.

01:19.301 --> 01:20.268
Well, that's catchy.

01:20.302 --> 01:23.066
(chanting):
Who's the lowest?

01:23.104 --> 01:25.368
We're the lowest.

01:25.407 --> 01:26.374
Megalo-team.

01:26.408 --> 01:28.433
Who's the lowest?

01:28.476 --> 01:30.774
We're the lowest...

01:30.812 --> 01:32.780
By the way,
we got another shipment

01:32.814 --> 01:34.782
of those culottes
your wife likes.

01:34.816 --> 01:36.784
Just remember,
a Chinese large is a medium.

01:36.818 --> 01:38.410
Well, Peggy loves
her culottes.

01:38.453 --> 01:40.546
Dang it.

01:40.588 --> 01:41.555
Just between you and me

01:41.589 --> 01:44.023
we got a little rat
infestation here.

01:44.059 --> 01:47.290
Hank, you're tapped in,
and I can trust you.

01:47.329 --> 01:48.626
You know a good exterminator?

01:48.663 --> 01:52.827
Someone who's discreet
but can get the job done?

01:52.867 --> 01:55.529
No.

02:03.945 --> 02:07.938
Yep.

02:07.982 --> 02:09.609
Yup.

02:09.651 --> 02:10.845
Ant!

02:10.884 --> 02:12.113
(grunts)

02:12.153 --> 02:13.279
Got him.

02:13.321 --> 02:14.379
You owe me five bucks.

02:14.422 --> 02:15.514
No way.

02:15.557 --> 02:16.922
Come on, Bill,
I need the money.

02:16.958 --> 02:18.755
That damned
new Pest Pro franchise

02:18.793 --> 02:21.261
has been taking
all my business.

02:21.296 --> 02:22.627
If I could
just get one

02:22.664 --> 02:25.189
good job,
I'd be back on my feet.

02:25.233 --> 02:27.394
Hey, Boomhauer, you any
closer to getting married?

02:27.435 --> 02:28.402
Dang ol'... huh?

02:28.436 --> 02:32.668
I heard
down at the chemical warehouse

02:32.707 --> 02:36.234
that MegaloMart's taking bids
for a rat problem.

02:36.277 --> 02:38.768
Man, that would be
a sweet gig.

02:38.813 --> 02:41.247
I could start paying
for Nancy's health insurance

02:41.282 --> 02:44.479
instead of just telling Nancy
I'm paying for it.

02:44.519 --> 02:46.077
(sighing)

02:46.121 --> 02:48.453
All right, Dale,
I can see you need the work

02:48.490 --> 02:50.583
and I know the manager
at MegaloMart.

02:50.625 --> 02:51.592
But be careful.

02:51.626 --> 02:55.221
This is a very big client
for me.

02:55.263 --> 02:56.230
All right, Hank!

02:56.264 --> 02:57.231
Hi, I'm Chuck Mangione

02:57.265 --> 02:59.631
and at MegaloMart,
our prices are falling

02:59.667 --> 03:02.329
faster than I am!

03:02.370 --> 03:05.271
("Feels So Good"playing)

03:05.306 --> 03:08.298
I just don't know
about putting my reputation

03:08.343 --> 03:09.503
in the hands of a man

03:09.544 --> 03:12.638
I wouldn't lend
my mechanical pencil to.

03:12.680 --> 03:13.840
Look, Dale needs this

03:13.882 --> 03:16.817
and if there's one thing
Dale can do, it's kill things.

03:16.851 --> 03:19.945
Wait, wait, does MegaloMart
still have a pet department?

03:19.988 --> 03:20.955
No.

03:20.989 --> 03:22.013
He'll be fine.

03:22.056 --> 03:24.024
Well, I guess
he'd do the same for me.

03:24.058 --> 03:26.549
I mean, whenever he prints up
that money of his

03:26.594 --> 03:28.789
I'm usually
on the 100-Gribble bill.

03:31.199 --> 03:33.497
I don't know
how to thank you, Hank.

03:33.535 --> 03:36.003
I'll let the
fellas down at
Shoebox Greetings

03:36.037 --> 03:37.061
do it for me.

03:37.105 --> 03:40.074
Just thank me
by doing a thorough, discreet

03:40.108 --> 03:44.807
professional, quiet, detailed,
courteous, efficient job.

03:44.846 --> 03:46.040
I won't let you down.

03:46.080 --> 03:48.048
I'm actually going
to spray poison

03:48.082 --> 03:49.049
instead of
walking around

03:49.083 --> 03:53.110
going "sss."

04:00.728 --> 04:03.288
So, anyway, uh,
the rats have chewed

04:03.331 --> 04:05.731
through the wires
in our security cameras

04:05.767 --> 04:08.395
and destroyed several hundred
dollars worth of crackers.

04:08.436 --> 04:10.404
Now, I don’t want
to alarm the customers

04:10.438 --> 04:12.406
so we got to keep a low profile.

04:12.440 --> 04:14.408
You won't know I'm here,
Gladewell

04:14.442 --> 04:16.410
but the rats that drag
their diseased bellies

04:16.444 --> 04:18.411
across
your merchandise will.

04:28.122 --> 04:29.316
And now, the bait.

04:29.357 --> 04:31.689
Hmm.

04:31.726 --> 04:35.662
Rat poison lasagna
or rat poison Salisbury steak?

04:35.697 --> 04:38.928
Ah, heck, Hank's reputation
is on the line.

04:38.967 --> 04:45.634
I'm going to let this rat
have it with both barrels.

04:45.673 --> 04:48.107
Nothing!

04:51.212 --> 04:58.675
What am I doing wrong?!

04:58.720 --> 05:01.188
I don't get it!

05:01.222 --> 05:04.555
Wait. I've encountered
a bite pattern like that before

05:04.592 --> 05:09.052
but where?

05:10.598 --> 05:12.065
Here!

05:12.100 --> 05:16.901
Now, where did I get that?

05:17.972 --> 05:18.836
Hmm.

05:18.873 --> 05:21.501
Possum, possum, manatee...

05:21.543 --> 05:23.340
Aha! Of course.

05:23.378 --> 05:26.370
Jungle Country Safari.

05:26.414 --> 05:29.406
I'm not looking for a rat
at all.

05:29.450 --> 05:31.645
CHRIS:
This is art, man.

05:31.686 --> 05:35.019
I told you, we should
totally build stage
designs for Creed.

05:35.056 --> 05:38.548
Hank, it's going better than
I could possibly have expected.

05:38.593 --> 05:40.561
Oh, good.
Did you catch it already?

05:40.595 --> 05:42.324
Not yet, but I'm on the trail.

05:42.363 --> 05:44.831
Remember when you
said you hoped I
learned my lesson

05:44.866 --> 05:46.834
from that run-in
with the baboon?

05:46.868 --> 05:50.269
Well, let's just say,
"Lesson learned and applied."

05:50.305 --> 05:53.502
Dude!
Dude!

05:53.541 --> 05:56.840
Oops. Uh...

05:56.878 --> 05:59.369
have you noticed any baboons
in the store lately?

05:59.414 --> 06:01.382
From a distance,
they may have looked

06:01.416 --> 06:05.352
like a large, hairy customer
with a bright red ass.

06:05.386 --> 06:08.321
(grunts)

06:08.356 --> 06:09.789
$39.99?!

06:09.824 --> 06:12.725
That's weird.

06:12.760 --> 06:17.197
I bought this CD for
$4.99 at CD Express

06:17.231 --> 06:19.722
and I thought it was
outrageously overpriced

06:19.767 --> 06:22.736
albeit quite pleasant
to make love to.

06:22.770 --> 06:25.398
Yeah, man, it's
real strange.

06:25.440 --> 06:26.532
Sometimes we see things

06:26.574 --> 06:28.599
and, like, the prices
are totally marked wrong

06:28.643 --> 06:31.476
and I know I didn't do it,
and I know he didn't do it.

06:31.512 --> 06:33.707
Yeah, and sometimes
in the morning

06:33.748 --> 06:37.184
the Mangione standees are all
facing a different direction

06:37.218 --> 06:39.482
than they were
the night before.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.420
How do you figure that?

06:41.456 --> 06:44.050
Hmm. You've added a piece
to the puzzle.

06:44.092 --> 06:48.324
Now, were the standees moved
sloppily, as if by a monkey

06:48.363 --> 06:50.058
or neatly, as if by a man?

06:50.098 --> 06:52.362
Neatly.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.595
As if by man.

06:54.636 --> 06:56.433
(groaning)

06:56.471 --> 07:00.168
Here's the deal,
Glidewell.

07:00.208 --> 07:01.232
This gig may be less

07:01.275 --> 07:03.743
of a quote-unquote
"extermination"

07:03.778 --> 07:06.246
and more
of a quote-unquote "murder."

07:06.280 --> 07:07.770
Just tell me you can handle it.

07:07.815 --> 07:09.510
Hank said you
were the best.

07:09.550 --> 07:11.177
Hank said that?

07:11.219 --> 07:14.484
I mean, I knew
he'd put in a good word for me

07:14.522 --> 07:16.387
but..."the best"?

07:16.424 --> 07:19.325
All right, I'll need
to spend the night here

07:19.360 --> 07:22.887
as my prey seems to be nocturnal
in nature.

07:22.930 --> 07:23.897
I don't know.

07:23.931 --> 07:24.898
It's against
company policy.

07:24.932 --> 07:26.900
I guarantee success by morning

07:26.934 --> 07:30.199
or Hank Hill
is a braying jackass.

07:30.238 --> 07:31.205
I really think

07:31.239 --> 07:33.207
I did the right thing
recommending Dale.

07:33.241 --> 07:36.335
Hank, you are distracting
my concentration.

07:36.377 --> 07:37.435
I'm trying
to teach Bobby

07:37.478 --> 07:39.446
how to play
Don't Spill the Beans.

07:39.480 --> 07:40.845
(nasal tone):
Out of beans!

07:40.882 --> 07:43.680
That's six games in a row, Mom.

07:43.718 --> 07:46.118
What? Now, that
is impossible.

07:46.154 --> 07:48.520
I've never lost anything
six times in a row.

07:48.556 --> 07:51.957
Bobby, open your mouth.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.688
Ah...

07:53.728 --> 07:56.253
(phone ringing)

07:56.297 --> 07:58.094
Hill residence.

07:58.132 --> 07:59.099
Dale, is that you?

07:59.133 --> 08:00.100
Are you done?

08:00.134 --> 08:01.101
It won’t be long now.

08:01.135 --> 08:02.500
I'm working through the night.

08:02.537 --> 08:04.505
You're spending the night
in the store?

08:04.539 --> 08:06.530
Is the rat problem that bad?

08:06.574 --> 08:07.541
Rat problem?

08:07.575 --> 08:10.703
Oh, of course, you still think
there's rats here.

08:10.745 --> 08:12.713
Well, don't beat yourself up,
Hank.

08:12.747 --> 08:15.716
I did too until the evidence
pointed to baboon.

08:15.750 --> 08:17.274
Baboon?!

08:17.318 --> 08:19.946
Dale, don’t tell Glidewell
there's a baboon.

08:19.987 --> 08:21.477
It's not a baboon.

08:21.522 --> 08:22.750
I know that.

08:22.790 --> 08:24.758
I won't bore you
with the details

08:24.792 --> 08:25.759
but bottom line...

08:25.793 --> 08:27.192
it's Chuck Mangione.
What?!

08:27.228 --> 08:30.891
And I'm going
to flush him out tonight.

08:30.932 --> 08:34.595
And Hank, Glidewell told me
you said I was the best.

08:34.635 --> 08:37.535
I nearly teared up
right there in front of him.

08:37.572 --> 08:39.039
No! No! No! No!

08:39.073 --> 08:42.008
Don’t worry, I didn't.

08:42.043 --> 08:44.273
(groaning)

08:44.312 --> 08:45.802
D-Dale, Dale?

08:45.847 --> 08:47.610
You know,
I have been thinking about it.

08:47.648 --> 08:50.378
You never should have
recommended Dale.

08:56.557 --> 08:58.752
Dale's losing it
at MegaloMart, Nancy.

08:58.793 --> 09:00.693
We need some traps
for the rats

09:00.728 --> 09:04.289
and a tranquilizer gun
for D... uh...

09:04.332 --> 09:05.822
Also for the rats.

09:05.867 --> 09:07.835
Hank, he has his
whole self-esteem

09:07.869 --> 09:09.837
tied up in killing
things smaller than he is.

09:09.871 --> 09:12.135
If y'all catch the
rat, please put
it in his pocket

09:12.173 --> 09:14.141
so he thinks he caught it.

09:17.078 --> 09:19.046
Here, everyone
put on a jumpsuit.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.741
If Glidewell shows up

09:20.782 --> 09:22.477
we'll look like
Dale's crew.

09:22.517 --> 09:25.350
HANK:
Now remember, find the rat

09:25.386 --> 09:33.851
kill the rat,
pat Dale on the back.

09:44.338 --> 09:46.169
HANK:
That's where the culottes are.

09:46.207 --> 09:48.266
(yelling, grunting)

09:48.309 --> 09:54.270
Quit... re... sis... ting!

09:54.315 --> 09:55.441
Ha!

09:55.483 --> 09:56.541
Hank?

09:56.584 --> 09:57.676
Give me that!

09:57.718 --> 09:59.151
What are you guys
doing here?

09:59.187 --> 10:01.382
And why are you wearing
my backup jumpsuit?

10:01.422 --> 10:03.515
And my backup's backups?

10:03.558 --> 10:06.118
Hold on.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.127
You're either here

10:07.161 --> 10:09.356
to check up on me
or goof on me.

10:09.397 --> 10:10.659
Which "on me" is it?

10:10.698 --> 10:13.132
You think I can't do the job?

10:13.167 --> 10:17.194
We’re just here 'cause...
well, the truth is

10:17.238 --> 10:18.398
we missed you in the alley

10:18.439 --> 10:22.341
so we put on the jumpsuits
to remind us of you

10:22.376 --> 10:26.710
and next thing you know,
here we are.

10:26.747 --> 10:27.714
Well, wingo.

10:27.748 --> 10:31.149
Grab a snack... aisle 12,
and a chair... aisle 94.

10:31.185 --> 10:33.585
But remember,
I'm after big game here...

10:33.621 --> 10:36.385
a breed known as
Chuckus Mangionus.

10:36.424 --> 10:37.914
'Sgo.

10:37.959 --> 10:39.449
(chuckling)

10:39.493 --> 10:41.757
Dale's crazy.

10:41.796 --> 10:43.286
(grunting)

10:43.331 --> 10:48.496
Come out of there,
you dang bean.

10:48.536 --> 10:50.800
Aha!
You little flapjack!

10:50.838 --> 10:52.237
I knew it!

10:52.273 --> 10:55.037
Nobody beats Peggy Hill
six times in a row.

10:55.076 --> 10:58.443
I can't breathe!

11:03.317 --> 11:04.511
Dale, look, a hole.

11:04.552 --> 11:07.077
Rat! Rat!
There it is!
Get it!

11:07.121 --> 11:09.089
Oh, man, dang ol'
there it is, man!

11:09.123 --> 11:11.091
No, it's behind you.
Dang ol' spray, man.

11:11.125 --> 11:12.092
Come on, come on,
right there.

11:12.126 --> 11:13.753
Get it man,
oh, don't...

11:13.794 --> 11:16.319
Way to go, Dale,
you... you captured the rat

11:16.364 --> 11:17.626
just like a real
exterminator!

11:17.665 --> 11:19.496
Glidewell's gonna...

11:19.533 --> 11:21.501
What the hell?!
You had the rat!

11:21.535 --> 11:23.503
Ah, that was
one of the ones I released

11:23.537 --> 11:24.504
to flush out Mangione.

11:24.538 --> 11:25.732
His name is Keith.

11:25.773 --> 11:29.539
What?! You're releasing rats
in the store?!

11:29.577 --> 11:31.238
My reputation is on the line!

11:31.279 --> 11:32.246
Don't worry.

11:32.280 --> 11:34.475
None of my five trained rats
will be here

11:34.515 --> 11:36.176
when Glidewell comes in.

11:36.217 --> 11:38.913
The mongoose I let out
will see to that.

11:38.953 --> 11:40.147
Mongoose?

11:40.187 --> 11:41.154
(sighs)

11:41.188 --> 11:43.315
Okay. I tell you what, Dale.

11:43.357 --> 11:44.551
You want to search for Chuck

11:44.592 --> 11:47.527
you do it by yourself
over there.

11:47.561 --> 11:50.029
We'll search for, uh... Chuck,
on our own over here.

11:50.064 --> 11:54.057
Whatever you do,
don't get captured.

11:54.101 --> 11:57.593
I will not negotiate
with Mangione.

12:18.059 --> 12:20.687
(awning)

12:20.728 --> 12:22.753
Mmm...

12:22.797 --> 12:24.697
(grunts)

12:24.732 --> 12:26.359
Got... dang it!

12:26.400 --> 12:27.492
Yeah, talking 'bout

12:27.535 --> 12:31.631
unleash them hounds, man.

12:31.672 --> 12:34.698
Crossbow armed.

12:34.742 --> 12:39.111
And now for the bait.

12:41.983 --> 12:43.450
(footsteps shuffling)

12:43.484 --> 12:44.473
Bill?

12:44.518 --> 12:48.147
Boomhauer?

13:11.512 --> 13:18.350
Whoo-hoo.
(giggles)

13:18.386 --> 13:19.944
Yo, man. Hey, Hank?

13:19.987 --> 13:21.079
Hey, man, stop that!

13:21.122 --> 13:23.352
Hey, man!

13:23.391 --> 13:27.919
(screaming)

13:32.767 --> 13:41.732
(fearful grunt)
It's got me!

13:49.083 --> 13:50.448
Dang it, Boomhauer

13:50.484 --> 13:51.781
you have one of these
at home.

13:51.819 --> 13:53.548
You're supposed to be working.

13:53.587 --> 13:55.248
Got dang ol' Gribble's right,
man!

13:55.289 --> 13:58.315
That dang ol' Mangione comes in,
turns switch, man.

13:58.359 --> 14:00.020
Started to spin around
like my head, man.

14:00.061 --> 14:01.585
What are you talking about?

14:01.629 --> 14:03.824
Man, I talking about that
dang ol' Chuck Mangione, man.

14:03.864 --> 14:04.728
I knew it!
Yippee!

14:04.765 --> 14:07.632
I knew he was here.
I felt his presence.

14:07.668 --> 14:08.600
Come on.

14:08.636 --> 14:10.433
There's an easy explanation
for this.

14:10.471 --> 14:11.904
You spun yourself too hard,
you got dizzy

14:11.939 --> 14:16.137
and then you saw one of those
stand-up displays of Chuck

14:16.177 --> 14:17.474
that are everywhere.

14:17.511 --> 14:19.001
Or Chuck himself.

14:19.046 --> 14:22.880
BILL:
Leave me alone!

14:22.917 --> 14:23.679
(grunts)

14:23.717 --> 14:25.617
What did Mangione do to you?

14:25.653 --> 14:27.018
Nothing.

14:27.054 --> 14:29.249
He was popping me
with a wet towel!

14:29.290 --> 14:31.190
It's the mongoose!

14:31.225 --> 14:32.487
He's headed for
my trip wires.

14:32.526 --> 14:34.221
Hit the deck!

14:34.261 --> 14:35.319
(Bill grunts)

14:35.362 --> 14:36.989
Dale, stop it.
Get up, you guys.

14:37.031 --> 14:38.225
(frightened grunting)

14:38.265 --> 14:40.392
Well, that's the
calculated risk

14:40.434 --> 14:42.095
you take when you
release a mongoose.

14:42.136 --> 14:43.194
That's it!

14:43.237 --> 14:44.704
That is
the last straw.

14:44.738 --> 14:46.603
You've gone and turned
a simple rat job

14:46.640 --> 14:49.165
into one of your
crazy conspiracies.

14:49.210 --> 14:51.804
I'm sorry I ever lied
to Glidewell for you, Dale.

14:51.846 --> 14:53.143
Lied?

14:53.180 --> 14:55.080
What are you saying?

14:55.116 --> 14:57.516
I promised on my word
that Glidewell

14:57.551 --> 15:00.384
would have his rat problem
taken care of.

15:00.421 --> 15:03.447
So I'm going to call Pest Pro
to make sure it's taken care of!

15:03.491 --> 15:06.517
You... you wouldn't, Hank.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.118
You've left me no choice.

15:08.162 --> 15:15.227
Dang it!

15:15.269 --> 15:16.236
The phone's dead.

15:16.270 --> 15:18.795
BILL:
Oh, God.

15:18.839 --> 15:22.468
The doors are blocked.

15:22.510 --> 15:24.375
Chuck don’t want us
to leave.

15:24.411 --> 15:28.404
("Feels So Good"playing)

15:28.449 --> 15:29.711
Told you, Hank.

15:29.750 --> 15:31.342
(Hank ells)

15:37.258 --> 15:38.555
Look, Dale

15:38.592 --> 15:40.423
I'll admit something
bigger than a rat

15:40.461 --> 15:42.725
must have moved
those soda machines.

15:42.763 --> 15:44.390
Now come on, help
us push them away

15:44.431 --> 15:45.898
so we can get
out of here.

15:45.933 --> 15:49.494
Yeah, that's exactly what
Chuck wants you to do.

15:49.537 --> 15:51.505
The first one
to touch those machines

15:51.539 --> 15:52.938
will be electrocuted.

15:52.973 --> 15:54.941
Then, while
the rest of you saps

15:54.975 --> 15:57.102
are staring at a charred
and twisted Bill

15:57.144 --> 15:58.111
Chuck will pounce.

15:58.145 --> 16:00.113
Dale, man...
I don’t want to die

16:00.147 --> 16:01.273
twisted, painful...

16:01.315 --> 16:02.612
Dale, help me
out here.

16:02.650 --> 16:04.709
What do you think
we should do?

16:04.752 --> 16:06.481
What are you asking me for?

16:06.520 --> 16:07.646
I'm loony.

16:07.688 --> 16:10.953
I'm going to go find me a Chuck.

16:10.991 --> 16:14.449
And if you're lucky, when
I check his stomach contents

16:14.495 --> 16:17.020
there won't be pieces of you.

16:17.064 --> 16:18.656
(sighs)

16:18.699 --> 16:20.667
All right. If we're going
to make it through tonight

16:20.701 --> 16:22.168
think, think.

16:22.203 --> 16:25.366
Okay, let's form
a back-to-back triangle

16:25.406 --> 16:26.964
so no one can
sneak up on us.

16:27.007 --> 16:32.843
This is good, this is good.

16:32.880 --> 16:37.112
If we just keep our wits about
us, everything will be fine.

16:37.151 --> 16:39.085
(loud clanging)

16:39.119 --> 16:40.677
(both screaming)

16:40.721 --> 16:45.954
You were supposed to keep
your wits about you.

16:45.993 --> 16:47.551
(Hank ells)

16:47.595 --> 16:49.119
Six beans.

16:49.163 --> 16:50.721
(inhaling deeply)

16:50.764 --> 16:51.731
Ah!

16:51.765 --> 16:52.732
Why don't
you go home

16:52.766 --> 16:53.562
and get some sleep.

16:53.601 --> 16:57.332
I believe it's your turn,
nose boy.

16:58.639 --> 16:59.663
Dale!

16:59.707 --> 17:02.767
Boomhauer!

17:02.810 --> 17:06.973
(ells)

17:07.013 --> 17:14.511
(grunts)

17:14.555 --> 17:20.117
(gasping):
Ch-Chuck?

17:20.160 --> 17:22.390
DALE:
Gotcha

17:22.429 --> 17:26.661
Mr. Adult Contemporary.

17:31.372 --> 17:32.236
I did it!

17:32.273 --> 17:34.241
I caught
Chuck Mangione!

17:34.275 --> 17:37.711
(yelps)

17:37.745 --> 17:39.576
What in the hell?!

17:39.613 --> 17:42.275
(sinister laughter)

17:42.316 --> 17:44.944
(evil giggling)

17:44.985 --> 17:47.954
Oh, you’re just the kids
from the music department.

17:47.988 --> 17:51.822
(chuckling):
He totally thought
we were Chuck Mangione, bro!

17:51.859 --> 17:53.451
We tooled
you big time!

17:53.494 --> 17:55.428
Oh, you are
such a tool!

17:55.462 --> 17:56.724
I blew it.

17:56.764 --> 17:59.790
All my exterminator's instincts
were wrong.

17:59.833 --> 18:02.063
I'm not fit to live
on this earth

18:02.102 --> 18:04.832
let alone kill the things
that live on this earth.

18:04.872 --> 18:06.134
Oh, you know what
we should do?

18:06.173 --> 18:08.141
Dude, we should dress him up
in ladies' lingerie

18:08.175 --> 18:10.143
take him
to the photo department

18:10.177 --> 18:11.144
and make him sit
on our laps!

18:11.178 --> 18:14.636
Let's just shave his
head like we planned.

18:14.682 --> 18:16.741
(shrieking)

18:16.784 --> 18:22.745
CHRIS (over P.A.):
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

18:29.296 --> 18:35.201
CORT:
You can run,
but you can't hide!

18:37.838 --> 18:39.567
All right, now
who are you?

18:39.606 --> 18:42.598
Take off the mask
and quit mocking me!

18:42.643 --> 18:45.737
Ouch! Watch the lip, man.

18:45.779 --> 18:47.838
(gasping):
It's you!

18:47.881 --> 18:49.906
It's... really you.

18:49.950 --> 18:51.042
So I'm not crazy

18:51.085 --> 18:52.677
but you are!

18:52.720 --> 18:54.688
You let a mongoose out
in the store.

18:54.722 --> 18:56.815
You're living in a
toilet paper fort.

18:56.857 --> 18:58.484
Let's agree to disagree.

18:58.525 --> 18:59.890
Chuck, I don't get it.

18:59.927 --> 19:01.087
What are you doing here?

19:01.128 --> 19:03.688
This is a long way from
The Merv Griffin Show.

19:03.731 --> 19:07.223
Ah, when I signed the contract
to be the MegaloMart spokesman

19:07.267 --> 19:08.996
I didn't read it carefully.

19:09.036 --> 19:11.334
I have to be
at every store opening

19:11.372 --> 19:13.340
and they open
400 stores a year.

19:13.374 --> 19:15.399
I haven't had time
to record or tour

19:15.442 --> 19:18.605
or give my old lady
any slow, sweet loving in years.

19:18.645 --> 19:19.612
So, I disappeared

19:19.646 --> 19:21.614
to the last place
they'd ever look for me.

19:21.648 --> 19:24.048
I've been living here rent-free,
eating their Cheerios

19:24.084 --> 19:26.985
playing their video games
and trying on their underpants.

19:27.020 --> 19:28.988
Anything to stick it to the Man.

19:29.022 --> 19:31.957
You chewed up
the security camera wires?

19:31.992 --> 19:33.084
It was necessary

19:33.127 --> 19:35.391
so I could come and go
as I pleased.

19:35.429 --> 19:36.862
But what about
the droppings?

19:36.897 --> 19:39.195
There were droppings
all over the place.

19:39.233 --> 19:40.200
(sinister chuckling)

19:40.234 --> 19:42.395
Make those Megalo chumps
pick'em up!

19:42.436 --> 19:43.403
They owe me!

19:43.437 --> 19:44.404
Right on.

19:44.438 --> 19:45.598
Keeping it real.

19:45.639 --> 19:47.334
(Hank shrieking)

19:47.374 --> 19:51.936
Sure sounds like
your friends need you, Dale.

19:51.979 --> 19:53.776
They do, Chuck.

19:53.814 --> 19:56.282
Wait. Every aisle has
a hollow passage

19:56.316 --> 19:58.716
with openings at
the discount flags.

19:58.752 --> 20:00.720
Use it.

20:09.096 --> 20:12.065
Look here, I don't know
what you two are hopped up on

20:12.099 --> 20:13.293
but it's going to wear off

20:13.333 --> 20:15.927
and you're going to be very
regretful about your actions.

20:15.969 --> 20:17.834
(both ell)

20:17.871 --> 20:19.270
(wailing):
Okay, you win!

20:19.306 --> 20:20.398
Can't breathe!

20:20.441 --> 20:22.841
Gentlemen, the
infestation
is over.

20:22.876 --> 20:24.503
Except for the mongoose

20:24.545 --> 20:37.253
but I'm sure
he's found a new home.

20:37.291 --> 20:38.622
Thanks for
the recommendation, Hank.

20:38.659 --> 20:40.024
If I'd called Pest Pro

20:40.060 --> 20:41.527
they would have just sprayed
in here

20:41.562 --> 20:43.689
and I'd have some parents
of dead teens suing me.

20:43.730 --> 20:46.893
Nice work, Gribble.

20:47.501 --> 20:50.197
Yeah, "Nice work, Gribble."

20:50.237 --> 20:52.364
(chuckling)

20:52.406 --> 20:53.896
Chuck Mangione
in the MegaloMart.

20:53.941 --> 20:55.431
Yeah, man, that dang
ol' Dale, man.

20:55.476 --> 20:58.104
Chuck Mangione probably in
Hollywood right now, man

20:58.145 --> 21:01.205
probably sticking
thatol' horn to
Minnie Driver, man.

21:01.248 --> 21:02.977
Yeah, my mistake.

21:03.016 --> 21:04.574
Silly me.

21:04.618 --> 21:06.552
Look, it might not have
been Chuck Mangione

21:06.587 --> 21:09.613
but he found the pests and
took care of the problem.

21:09.656 --> 21:12.352
Dale, I'd recommend
you anytime.

21:12.392 --> 21:15.555
Sorry I doubted you.

21:15.596 --> 21:17.826
("Feels So Good"
playing softly)

21:17.865 --> 21:18.889
What was that?

21:18.932 --> 21:20.024
Muzak.

21:20.067 --> 21:23.434
Just... Muzak.
