WEBVTT

00:02.567 --> 00:03.133
- Tonight, part two

00:04.633 --> 00:05.567
of "The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills"

00:05.600 --> 00:07.500
reunion begins.

00:07.533 --> 00:11.266
- I did not realize how
much Teddi disliked Dorit,

00:11.300 --> 00:17.000
and it was mean to have gone
far enough down that road.

00:17.033 --> 00:19.033
- For someone who is
the queen of accountability,

00:19.066 --> 00:20.467
so to speak--

00:20.500 --> 00:22.600
- I'm taking accountability
for it right now.

00:22.633 --> 00:25.533
- At Vanderpump Dogs,
when I saw that Lisa said,

00:25.567 --> 00:28.166
"No, no, no,"
I thought to myself,

00:28.200 --> 00:31.600
"Wow, it wasn't actually
your conscience," and thought,

00:31.633 --> 00:33.567
"I don't want to
do this to Dorit."

00:33.600 --> 00:38.066
It was, "I don't want to be the
only one to do this to Dorit."

00:38.100 --> 00:39.300
- Because pri--pri--
- And that hurt.

00:39.333 --> 00:41.600
- And I'm sorry,
and prior to this year, I--

00:41.633 --> 00:44.367
we didn't have a relationship.
- No, we didn't.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.333
- And I--
- But still I could never go

00:46.367 --> 00:50.266
and try and deliberately hurt
someone that badly in that way.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.400
- I was kind of in it, texting
with them, being catty back,

00:53.433 --> 00:55.100
and, like, "All right, well,
give me more deets.

00:55.133 --> 00:56.467
Show me the tea,"

00:56.500 --> 00:59.567
not being the most
above-board human being.

00:59.600 --> 01:02.400
It's like I almost put a wall
up in regards to you

01:02.433 --> 01:04.333
to just do what she wanted me
to do because in the end,

01:04.367 --> 01:06.667
this will just be
better for me.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.300
- So you never
brought it up to Lisa?

01:09.333 --> 01:10.600
- No.

01:10.633 --> 01:12.266
- But I mean, if you were
so involved in this plan,

01:12.300 --> 01:13.667
I mean,
why not just say to her--

01:13.700 --> 01:16.333
- Because when the person
that works for you

01:16.367 --> 01:20.066
and idolizes you
and does everything for you

01:20.100 --> 01:22.500
is calling you and saying,
"Hold on, Lisa's freaking out.

01:22.533 --> 01:24.367
"She can't get Dorit
to call her back.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.166
She wants to use your name,"

01:26.200 --> 01:28.233
I just went along with it,
and I'm not for one second

01:28.266 --> 01:30.433
saying that's not
a stupid thing that I did.

01:30.467 --> 01:34.433
- By the way, Dorit,
the viewers really feel

01:34.467 --> 01:37.533
you caused this whole mess
by not returning Lucy

01:37.567 --> 01:39.700
to Vanderpump Dogs
in the first place.

01:39.734 --> 01:42.533
I mean, can you admit
you made a mistake there?

01:42.567 --> 01:46.533
- 100%, and Andy,
I have so many regrets.

01:46.567 --> 01:49.567
I wish that I had just brought
Lucy back to the center.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.100
- For the life of me,
I still don't understand

01:52.133 --> 01:55.600
why you just didn't return the
dog back to Vanderpump Dogs.

01:55.633 --> 01:58.200
- This was never a careless
thought about Lucy.

01:58.233 --> 01:59.633
It was always,

01:59.667 --> 02:02.567
always thinking that this was
in Lucy's best interest.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.667
I believed she was going
to a loving home.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.600
- Well, and didn't you
call Lisa the next day?

02:06.633 --> 02:08.600
- I spoke to Lisa the next day,
within 12 hours.

02:08.633 --> 02:10.467
- And she was okay with it.
- And said what?

02:10.500 --> 02:12.600
- Well, she was not only okay.
She never once said to me--

02:12.633 --> 02:14.734
- "Get that dog back," yeah.
- "You cannot rehome the dog.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.200
You have to bring her
back to the center,"

02:16.233 --> 02:17.600
because believe me,
Andy, I would.

02:17.633 --> 02:20.166
- Did they send someone
to go look at the home?

02:20.200 --> 02:21.734
- No, she never did
a home visit.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.467
She never followed up with me.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.500
- So she obviously felt it was
in a good home too.

02:25.533 --> 02:26.734
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes, of course.

02:26.767 --> 02:28.600
- I think it's really important
to say

02:28.633 --> 02:31.200
this is not a kill shelter.
Every animal shelter

02:31.233 --> 02:33.700
has a facility
that they can euthanize.

02:33.734 --> 02:35.667
- Rumor leaves a stain.

02:35.700 --> 02:38.667
They put a story out
that is disgusting.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.500
Lucy was never in danger
of being killed.

02:41.533 --> 02:46.633
- Teddi, it was striking to me
that you went so far

02:46.667 --> 02:48.433
in the other direction
in the Bahamas.

02:48.467 --> 02:50.633
- I did nothing wrong.

02:50.667 --> 02:54.567
I am an honest person.
Never once have I told a lie,

02:54.600 --> 02:57.500
and never will you
ever hear me tell one.

02:57.533 --> 02:59.467
- 'Cause I mean,
when you said at the table,

02:59.500 --> 03:01.600
"I never lie. I don't lie--"

03:01.633 --> 03:05.133
- Because at that point,
I had already said to Dorit,

03:05.166 --> 03:07.734
"I'm involved.
I called you a narcissist.

03:07.767 --> 03:10.266
"I said bad things
about you as a mom

03:10.300 --> 03:11.567
because
you did that to your kid."

03:11.600 --> 03:13.567
- No, you didn't, you didn't
say any of those things.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.233
You just said,
"I had impure thoughts."

03:15.266 --> 03:16.500
That's all you said, Teddi.

03:16.533 --> 03:18.200
- I said I called you
a narcissist.

03:18.233 --> 03:19.667
- Not then,
nothing in the Bahamas.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.767
- Okay.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.567
- Okay. I'm not gonna pretend

03:22.600 --> 03:25.567
that for that first moment
that I got that first call

03:25.600 --> 03:29.400
I wasn't thinking catty things
but I wasn't going to do it.

03:29.433 --> 03:31.166
- Weren't you still lying?

03:31.200 --> 03:32.667
Because the others
didn't know--

03:32.700 --> 03:34.400
- I've definitely learned
my lesson

03:34.433 --> 03:36.266
in speaking in absolutes.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.500
- I mean, you literally said,
"I never lie,"

03:38.533 --> 03:42.600
but you were lying,
and you're lying about lying.

03:42.633 --> 03:44.400
- I'm actually not lying
about lying.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.667
I've taken
ownership repeatedly.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.467
- I think she meant, obviously

03:48.500 --> 03:50.600
that she's not a liar,
but she--

03:50.633 --> 03:53.400
- I pride myself on being
an honest person,

03:53.433 --> 03:55.567
and multiple times
I was like,

03:55.600 --> 03:58.200
you know, toying in my head,
am I making a mistake?

03:58.233 --> 04:02.700
- Camille, you said, well,
this somehow rings true to you.

04:02.734 --> 04:05.166
What happened to you
in season two?

04:05.200 --> 04:07.333
- You know, we were talking,
Lisa and I,

04:07.367 --> 04:09.433
and she was concerned
about Taylor.

04:09.467 --> 04:11.667
You know, she wanted me
to discuss it,

04:11.700 --> 04:13.667
but when I started
to discuss it,

04:13.700 --> 04:16.000
she kind of just left me
out there to dry.

04:16.033 --> 04:19.700
Because we don't say
that he hits you.

04:19.733 --> 04:23.567
We don't say that,
but now we said it.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.300
- Now they're saying,

04:25.333 --> 04:27.300
"Oh, Camille's saying
you said this about Taylor."

04:27.333 --> 04:28.567
- But you asked me
to repeat things.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.734
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

04:29.767 --> 04:31.467
You tell me what to say,

04:31.500 --> 04:33.300
and now you're throwing me
under a bus and I'm leaving.

04:33.333 --> 04:35.667
You threw me
under a bus just now.

04:35.700 --> 04:37.433
I'm out in the deep end.

04:37.467 --> 04:40.700
Throw me a life raft,
and there wasn't one.

04:40.734 --> 04:43.400
- Some of you thought that
Vanderpump should have fired

04:43.433 --> 04:46.433
John Blizzard
for trashing Dorit.

04:46.467 --> 04:49.266
- You have kind of
complicated my life.

04:49.300 --> 04:51.734
- I put words in your mouth
that were not true,

04:51.767 --> 04:53.600
and I will own that,
and I'm sorry for that.

04:53.633 --> 04:57.333
- It's interesting because
I remember in season two

04:57.367 --> 04:59.734
when Adrienne's chef, Bernie...

04:59.767 --> 05:03.600
- Oh, yeah.
- Spoke ill of Vanderpump.

05:03.633 --> 05:05.734
- Who doesn't love macaroni
and cheese?

05:05.767 --> 05:08.066
- The British lady across
the street, probably.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.734
- Hello.
- Oh, it's Lisa.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.500
- Time to go.

05:11.533 --> 05:12.734
- Can we shut those
two doors, please?

05:12.767 --> 05:14.500
Pull the doors towards you.

05:14.533 --> 05:16.467
- I don't know where
all this came from,

05:16.500 --> 05:19.333
and I really didn't understand
how Adrienne would let somebody

05:19.367 --> 05:21.734
who worked for her
publicly kind of trash somebody

05:21.767 --> 05:23.600
that was a friend of hers

05:23.633 --> 05:26.600
because, you know, if I had
somebody that worked for me,

05:26.633 --> 05:28.600
I wouldn't dream
of letting them, you know,

05:28.633 --> 05:31.500
trash one of my friends,
especially in public.

05:31.533 --> 05:33.367
- First of all--

05:33.400 --> 05:34.567
[tense music]

05:34.600 --> 05:36.100
- What was your reaction
to that?

05:36.133 --> 05:37.633
- She couldn't fire him
because he was doing

05:37.667 --> 05:39.633
what he was told to do.
- Ouch.

05:39.667 --> 05:41.734
- That was also
a telltale sign.

05:41.767 --> 05:44.100
- I mean, who doesn't get
reprimanded or fired,

05:44.133 --> 05:46.400
particularly if he's
such a junior, Andy?

05:46.433 --> 05:49.700
- He has a lot of information.
- That's what I was gonna say.

05:49.734 --> 05:53.400
He has a lot of things to say,
should he get fired.

05:53.433 --> 05:55.066
- He'll probably be there
a very long time.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.633
- Some of the viewers
have complained

05:56.667 --> 05:59.367
that you have spent
the vast majority of the season

05:59.400 --> 06:01.400
talking about
Vanderpump and Puppygate,

06:01.433 --> 06:04.266
maybe even strategically
so that you could bury

06:04.300 --> 06:07.367
some of the negative stories
surrounding yourselves.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.367
Monty from Nevada said,

06:09.400 --> 06:12.000
"Erika's happy to talk about
Lisa Vanderpump all day,

06:12.033 --> 06:13.633
"but when it comes
to Tom defaulting

06:13.667 --> 06:17.433
on a $15 million loan,
she doesn't say a word."

06:17.467 --> 06:20.533
- How about this?
Resolved, and they apologized.

06:20.567 --> 06:22.667
- Right.
Amy from Texas said,

06:22.700 --> 06:24.300
"I guess Kyle
isn't gonna mention

06:24.333 --> 06:27.133
Mauricio scamming someone
out of $37 million

06:27.166 --> 06:29.667
when she can just
talk about Dorit's dog."

06:29.700 --> 06:31.667
- My husband
did not scam anyone.

06:31.700 --> 06:35.066
That causes problems because
my husband has never made

06:35.100 --> 06:36.667

sold for, okay?

- So your question from whoever
the (BLEEP) Monty is...

06:42.000 --> 06:44.400
- Yes.
- In Magootville saying

- Okay, Amy from Texas,
that's a misleading question.

- There's a lawsuit relating
to a dispute about a property.

06:52.467 --> 06:54.133
- And that's it.
A simple dispute.

06:54.166 --> 06:55.700
- Yeah, but the way it was
worded is damaging.

08:37.467 --> 08:38.734
- And it was designed
specifically for that entity.

08:38.767 --> 08:40.100
The judge has ordered
mediation.

08:40.133 --> 08:41.500
The judge looked at it
and said,

08:41.533 --> 08:43.000
"Listen,
you guys figure this out."

08:43.033 --> 08:45.233
I am very comfortable
in our position.

08:45.266 --> 08:46.667
It is in the lawyers' hands.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.734
It doesn't need
to have a discussion

08:48.767 --> 08:50.600
because there's
a lot of details about it

08:50.633 --> 08:52.033
that I can't
really speak about.

08:52.066 --> 08:53.700
- Right.
Well, interestingly,

08:53.734 --> 08:55.433
an article came out yesterday

08:55.467 --> 08:58.266
about a lawsuit
that Lisa's involved in.

08:58.300 --> 09:02.033
A former employee claims that
she was wrongfully terminated

09:02.066 --> 09:04.567
after allegedly
being told to sign

09:04.600 --> 09:08.667
John Sessa's name
on foundation checks.

09:08.700 --> 09:10.667
- Was that, like, forgery?

09:10.700 --> 09:13.700
- So would Lisa have been open
about this lawsuit

09:13.734 --> 09:15.500
if it had happened
during the season?

09:15.533 --> 09:16.734
- Well, I don't know.

09:16.767 --> 09:18.567
I doubt it, but I would
not have brought it up.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.200
I don't want to hurt
her business or hurt her.

09:20.233 --> 09:22.100
As a group of friends,
we don't say,

09:22.133 --> 09:23.667
"Hey, Erika, so what is
going on with that thing?"

09:23.700 --> 09:25.000
- That's right.
- Or what happened with--

09:25.033 --> 09:26.467
- You don't?
- No.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.600
- No.
- I would.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.200
If my friend was being sued--

09:29.233 --> 09:30.700
- Well, you would 'cause look
what you do for a living.

09:30.734 --> 09:32.767
- No, no, no, but I mean,
I have a friend who's--

09:33.000 --> 09:35.467
- No, but you do ask them,
"Are you okay? Are you okay?"

09:35.500 --> 09:37.033
- Right, but then
if you're gonna say

09:37.066 --> 09:39.000
that everybody should be
talking about your lawsuits,

09:39.033 --> 09:41.033
then she should
be talking about hers.

09:41.066 --> 09:43.100
- Okay, well,
we're gonna leave it there.

09:43.133 --> 09:46.000
When it comes to the pressures
in Beverly Hills

09:46.033 --> 09:49.033
to have the ideal body,
it's easy to feel like

09:49.066 --> 09:52.300
you're living
in the 9021-size zero,

09:52.333 --> 09:54.767
but sometimes the obsession
with perfection

09:55.000 --> 09:57.567
can make the weight of it
all too heavy to bear.

09:57.600 --> 09:58.734
Take a look.

09:58.767 --> 10:00.233
[upbeat music]

10:00.266 --> 10:01.700
- Guts in, tits up.

10:01.734 --> 10:05.033
Wear your ass
out like you like it.

10:05.066 --> 10:08.700
We're selling ass.
We're not selling cookies!

10:08.734 --> 10:12.166
- I can do sexy, but Erika,
she kind of,

10:12.200 --> 10:15.200
like, takes sexy
to a whole other level.

10:15.233 --> 10:18.300
- ♪ Everybody knows that
I'm a million-dollar diamond ♪

10:18.333 --> 10:20.633
- I look at myself
as an art project,

10:20.667 --> 10:24.767
and I'll create whatever
I want till I want to stop.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.567
- I haven't eaten anything
but candy today.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.100
- That's a good day,
candy and champagne,

10:28.133 --> 10:30.000
sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar.

10:30.033 --> 10:31.700
- Yeah, right? I eat dessert
every day of my life,

10:31.734 --> 10:34.266
and I'm not ----ing making
any excuses for it.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.333
Mmm.

10:36.367 --> 10:37.734
- When I first moved out here,

10:37.767 --> 10:39.734
I put on,
like, a lot of weight.

10:39.767 --> 10:43.000
I got sent out on a bunch
of auditions for pilot season,

10:43.033 --> 10:46.100
and a day later I get a call
from my manager,

10:46.133 --> 10:49.033
and he's like, "Listen,
you need to lose weight.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.700
- I can remember times when
I'm only gonna have

10:50.734 --> 10:52.233
six almonds today,
and that's all I'm gonna have.

10:52.266 --> 10:55.233
- All day?
- I was 99 pounds.

10:55.266 --> 10:57.767
It was like that for years.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.633
I never wanted my kids

10:59.667 --> 11:01.233
to have that problem,
you know what I mean?

11:01.266 --> 11:04.200
- I made my own food.
I'm allergic to all of that.

11:04.233 --> 11:06.333
- You're allergic to salad?
- No, I'm just not hungry.

11:06.367 --> 11:08.033
- I'm allergic to everything.

11:08.066 --> 11:12.066
No matter how many
deaths anorexia causes,

11:12.100 --> 11:15.000
no matter how much blindness,
how much hair loss,

11:15.033 --> 11:19.600
all I cared about
was the skinniness.

11:19.633 --> 11:22.033
I could have died.

11:24.433 --> 11:27.033
- What made Amelia decide
to go public

11:27.066 --> 11:29.266
about her anorexia
on Instagram?

11:29.300 --> 11:31.266
- You know,
the answer is I don't know.

11:31.300 --> 11:33.066
She did it without asking me.

11:33.100 --> 11:36.000
It probably had been going on
for longer than we know,

11:36.033 --> 11:38.133
but when you physically see it,
it's undeniable.

11:38.166 --> 11:40.567
You can't--you can't ignore it.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.200
- Did your family know
before you came out?

11:43.233 --> 11:46.700
- Yes and no.
I was really angry about it.

11:46.734 --> 11:48.734
I remember coming home
for Thanksgiving once

11:48.767 --> 11:50.667
and, you know,
them making a comment like,

11:50.700 --> 11:52.633
"You good?"
and I was pissed.

11:52.667 --> 11:54.333
I'm like, "Like me how I am.
What's your problem?"

11:54.367 --> 11:56.100
- And how did her
anger manifest itself?

11:56.133 --> 11:57.700
- When we had that barbeque,

11:57.734 --> 12:02.734
I think that that was
a really pivotal point.

12:02.767 --> 12:04.266
- Does it really upset you

12:04.300 --> 12:06.133
that I can't eat your food
that you make?

12:06.166 --> 12:10.367
Does it really make you angry?
His energy is so effed up.

12:10.400 --> 12:14.033
- What could Harry have done
differently in that situation?

12:14.066 --> 12:15.734
- Well, from what
the therapist told him

12:15.767 --> 12:17.333
when he went to see
the therapist,

12:17.367 --> 12:19.166
she said, "You have to shut
the (BLEEP) up,"

12:19.200 --> 12:20.700
and those were the exact words
that she said to him.

12:20.734 --> 12:22.667
- I was gonna say,
he couldn't have done anything.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.233
- Nothing. Amelia's gone
through a lot in her anorexia.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.700
She's quite healthy right now.

12:26.734 --> 12:28.700
- Uh-huh.
- Right in this moment,

12:28.734 --> 12:32.066
and recently people have said,
"Well, you don't look anorexic.

12:32.100 --> 12:36.000
You're not that thin,"
which is a really big trigger.

12:36.033 --> 12:37.734
It's ----ing difficult.
- Yeah.

12:37.767 --> 12:42.066
We've seen you become defensive
when anyone ever questions

12:42.100 --> 12:44.767
your--whether
you have any issues.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.066
- Tuna tartare
on a wonton crisp?

12:47.100 --> 12:49.667
- Beautiful.
- She doesn't eat though.

12:49.700 --> 12:52.066
- Oh.
- Shut--you know what?

12:52.100 --> 12:54.400
I'm gonna ----ing--
- Oh, you--oh, oh, just--

12:54.433 --> 12:56.300
- I'm gonna smack you
in the face pretty soon!

12:56.333 --> 12:58.000
Don't say that.

12:58.033 --> 13:01.200
- Do you think there's
anything she picked up

13:01.233 --> 13:03.467
from watching whatever
your relationship is

13:03.500 --> 13:05.066
with food or with your body?

13:05.100 --> 13:07.166
- Probably, yeah.
Do I have any food issues?

13:07.200 --> 13:09.333
I probably do
'cause I'm in this business.

13:09.367 --> 13:11.266
- Do you think you're
addicted to exercise?

13:11.300 --> 13:13.166
- No, I don't.
- Okay.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.734
- Like, I probably work out
three, four, five times a week

13:15.767 --> 13:17.000
depending on my schedule.

13:17.033 --> 13:18.700
- Got it.
- I'm just consistent.

13:18.734 --> 13:20.033
- Right.
- But I've been the same weight

13:20.066 --> 13:22.200
ever since I was 20.

13:22.233 --> 13:24.133
- Yeah.
- I mean, I'm not bulimic.

13:24.166 --> 13:27.133
I don't believe I'm anorexic.
I mean, we've talked about it.

13:27.166 --> 13:30.033
I've gone to therapy,
so I can't blame myself,

13:30.066 --> 13:32.133
but again, I blame myself.
- You do?

13:32.166 --> 13:33.767
- There's so much shame
around it,

13:34.000 --> 13:35.367
and I don't understand
that part of it.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.734
- Well, for me it was
about my kids

13:36.767 --> 13:38.734
because I had never
told my daughters,

13:38.767 --> 13:41.000
and, you know,
I grew up with a mom

13:41.033 --> 13:43.367
who was very open
about everything and so much

13:43.400 --> 13:45.333
that it would
make me uncomfortable,

13:45.367 --> 13:47.033
and I kinda went
the opposite way,

13:47.066 --> 13:48.467
so I don't--you know,

13:48.500 --> 13:50.233
I sheltered them from a lot
of things, and I just--

13:50.266 --> 13:52.433
- Have you since spoken
to your family about it?

13:52.467 --> 13:55.133
- A bit, but I still have
not had the full-on

13:55.166 --> 13:57.200
because I'm scared.
I was--

13:57.233 --> 13:59.166
- Why?
- I know it's horrible.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.333
I just--
- It's not horrible, honey.

14:01.367 --> 14:03.033
- Denise, as an actress,

14:03.066 --> 14:04.367
what's your
relationship with food?

14:04.400 --> 14:06.734
- I've always been able
to pretty much eat

14:06.767 --> 14:08.200
whatever I want,

14:08.233 --> 14:10.266
but I actually lost
a job not that--

14:10.300 --> 14:13.000
a few years ago
for being too thin.

14:13.033 --> 14:16.367
They went off of paparazzi
pictures, and it was when

14:16.400 --> 14:19.033
Eloise was not walking yet,
so I was always carrying her.

14:19.066 --> 14:21.767
My arms were really,
really lean,

14:22.000 --> 14:23.333
and that, for the first time,

14:23.367 --> 14:26.300
made me very self-conscious
leaving the house.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.700
Like, sh--, you have
to be looking a certain way,

14:28.734 --> 14:30.700
and that can affect your job.

14:30.734 --> 14:33.400
- Right. Tyler from Bellevue,
Washington, said,

14:33.433 --> 14:35.467
"Erika, you're my hero
for eating Cheese Whiz

14:35.500 --> 14:37.433
"and pumpkin pie
for breakfast.

14:37.467 --> 14:41.000
Where does your body-positive
attitude come from?"

14:41.033 --> 14:42.433
- I always grew up
really thin.

14:42.467 --> 14:44.233
This is probably the heaviest

14:44.266 --> 14:46.033
I've ever been
in my entire life.

14:46.066 --> 14:49.000
- Really?
- Yeah, but I know how to eat.

14:49.033 --> 14:51.767
I know how to lean down,
and I know I enjoy pumpkin pie

14:52.000 --> 14:54.033
and aerosol cheese,
you know, so--

14:54.066 --> 14:57.000
- Skylar from Phoenix said,
"Camille, last year

14:57.033 --> 14:58.200
"you weren't feeling 100%

14:58.233 --> 15:00.033
secure with your body
after cancer."

15:00.066 --> 15:01.767
- I said to my mom,
"I can never have sex.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.433
I have nothing
left down there."

15:03.467 --> 15:05.500
So my doctor goes--she
puts her fingers up there.

15:05.533 --> 15:07.567
She goes, "Oh, look,
I got four in--I got three

15:07.600 --> 15:09.567
or four fingers in there.
You have enough room."

15:09.600 --> 15:11.567
- How are you feeling
about it these days?

15:11.600 --> 15:13.567
- Better, but
it's still a struggle.

15:13.600 --> 15:17.033
- But isn't it funny how every
one of us has--

15:17.066 --> 15:19.533
we have our own thoughts
about our bodies,

15:19.567 --> 15:22.066
whether they're big,
small, great, tight, whatever?

15:22.100 --> 15:24.367
- All right, well, weight
and having the perfect body

15:24.400 --> 15:26.000
aren't the only issues

15:26.033 --> 15:28.166
that have plagued
the women of Beverly Hills.

15:28.200 --> 15:31.533
You are also consumed with
finding the fountain of youth.

15:31.567 --> 15:33.367
- Ha ha.
- Rachel from Portland said,

15:33.400 --> 15:35.166
"Dorit, according
to Lisa Vanderpump,

15:35.200 --> 15:37.166
"you've had a head transplant.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.767
What work have you had done
since last season?"

15:40.000 --> 15:41.400
- By the way,
that was not very nice.

15:41.433 --> 15:43.166
- No.
- It was not.

15:43.200 --> 15:46.033
- Do you think
Dorit's face has changed

15:46.066 --> 15:48.500
in the last year
as much as her accent?

15:48.533 --> 15:52.066
- She's had a head transplant.
- I hate it when people say,

15:52.100 --> 15:54.500
"What work have you had done?"
What work have you had done?

15:54.533 --> 15:56.300
- Well, but the thing about it
is--I do but--

15:56.333 --> 15:58.100
- I know, and I think
she should answer it,

15:58.133 --> 15:59.600
but at the same time
it's just kinda rude.

15:59.633 --> 16:03.200
- I think since
"The Housewives" has begun,

16:03.233 --> 16:09.367
one of the tropes, I think,
that is common among every city

16:09.400 --> 16:14.633
and every franchise is women
chasing the fountain of youth

16:14.667 --> 16:17.133
and trying to look better
and look great.

16:17.166 --> 16:18.367
- But what's wrong with that?

16:18.400 --> 16:20.133
- There's nothing wrong
with it.

16:20.166 --> 16:22.000
- Now, there is
something wrong with it

16:22.033 --> 16:23.433
when you are judged for it.
- That's right.

16:23.467 --> 16:25.433
- This is how I choose
to live my life.

16:25.467 --> 16:28.033
However I choose to alter
my body or present myself--

16:28.066 --> 16:29.533
- But where was the judgment?
- From others.

16:29.567 --> 16:31.100
- From others.
- It's one thing if you say,

16:31.133 --> 16:32.400
"Oh, my--Erika,
your skin looks amazing."

16:32.433 --> 16:34.000
- "You look refreshed.

16:34.033 --> 16:35.433
"Can you tell me,
what are you doing for that?"

16:35.467 --> 16:37.300
Instead of,
"What work have you had done?"

16:37.333 --> 16:39.467
And then judging you
because you had it.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.400
"Oh, if I had a nose job,
I bet I'd look like that too."

16:41.433 --> 16:44.066
Well, then go ----ing get one.
- So--but if Vanderpump said,

16:44.100 --> 16:45.633
you had your head--
head transplant.

16:45.667 --> 16:47.667
But she's also been very open

16:47.700 --> 16:49.600
about anything
that she's ever done, right?

16:49.633 --> 16:52.233
- Really?
- Oh, no?

16:52.266 --> 16:55.100
Tell the truth.
Did you get a butt implant?

16:55.133 --> 16:57.133
- No, I have, like,
big knickers with, like,

16:57.166 --> 16:59.533
butt implants in them
that I--I'll sometimes--

16:59.567 --> 17:01.600
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't.

17:01.633 --> 17:03.667
- And I'm very happy to say
what I've had done

17:03.700 --> 17:05.633
because I think it's comical
when people think

17:05.666 --> 17:08.467
that I've had a face lift
and surgeries.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.233
A little Botox and filler.

17:10.266 --> 17:12.165
That's all I've ever done
to my face, that's it.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.666
- Did you have a nose job?
- No!

17:13.700 --> 17:17.165
Makeup can do wonders,
but that's the truth, so.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.433
- You didn't have
a head transplant?

17:18.467 --> 17:20.099
- I didn't have
a head transplant, no.

17:20.133 --> 17:21.700
- I don't see any neck scars.

17:21.733 --> 17:24.300
- Yeah.
[laughter]

17:24.333 --> 17:25.666
- Coming up...

17:25.700 --> 17:28.500
- Anytime you want to have
a conversation with Kyle,

17:28.532 --> 17:30.567
Teddi's there to cut you off,
and on one--

17:30.600 --> 17:32.400
- Oh, I have a--
I have a question.

17:32.433 --> 17:34.567
I'm cutting you off, but--
- Okay. God, there you go!

17:34.600 --> 17:37.066
There's my point.
- But when we're at the--

17:44.700 --> 17:45.200
- Welcome back to

17:46.700 --> 17:49.300
"The Real Housewives of
Beverly Hills" reunion.

17:49.333 --> 17:53.433
Well, when Lisa Vanderpump left
a vacant lot in Kyle's heart,

17:53.467 --> 17:57.734
Teddi moved right in and became
her new bestie on the block.

17:57.767 --> 18:00.400
Whether it's working out
or calling people out,

18:00.433 --> 18:03.233
these two are like peas
in a pod.

18:03.266 --> 18:04.667
Watch.
[laughter]

18:04.700 --> 18:06.533
- Let's hold hands
while we watch this.

18:06.567 --> 18:08.133
Here they go.

18:08.166 --> 18:10.133
- Right, I don't know
how to do that.

18:10.166 --> 18:11.533
- I've never done girls trips,

18:11.567 --> 18:15.133
and I probably wouldn't have
if it wasn't for you.

18:15.166 --> 18:16.433
- Oh, I love you.

18:16.467 --> 18:18.233
- But you guys,
that's a big deal.

18:18.266 --> 18:20.133
- I literally love you so much.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.734
You're like my little sister.
We're sisters.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.367
- I'll cry.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.233
Hi.
- Hi.

18:25.266 --> 18:26.567
- How are you?
- I'm good.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.233
You haven't been here
for a while.

18:28.266 --> 18:30.533
- I know 'cause all we ever do
is work out.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.400
- My relationship
with Teddi has just grown.

18:32.433 --> 18:35.700
We have so much in common,
and we make each other laugh.

18:35.734 --> 18:37.667
[laughter]
This is comfortable.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.500
- I like it in here.

18:39.533 --> 18:41.333
I want to sleep in here.
- Oh, my God, me too.

18:41.367 --> 18:45.533
- Should we get into the--
nothing to see here, folks.

18:45.567 --> 18:47.734
- These are really long.

18:47.767 --> 18:49.667
I have never seen someone
put a lash on like that.

18:49.700 --> 18:51.600
What are you doing?

18:51.633 --> 18:54.000
- Teddi and Kyle have gotten
really, really close.

18:54.033 --> 18:58.166
Kyle, she kinda helps her get
dressed, put her makeup on.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.400
- Kyle has lots of style.
Teddi, you're coming around.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.266
[laughter]

19:03.300 --> 19:06.734
Teddi's raised her fashion game
from a year ago for sure.

19:06.767 --> 19:09.467
- I need a little bit of help.
I--let's be honest.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.333
I don't know what to wear
to your store opening,

19:11.367 --> 19:13.500
and I don't know what to wear
to a day fashion show.

19:13.533 --> 19:17.300
- Okay, we can fix that.
- Kyle lends clothes to Teddi.

19:17.333 --> 19:18.767
Eventually
you're just gonna see

19:19.000 --> 19:20.734
that they've morphed
into one person.

19:20.767 --> 19:22.400
[laughter]

19:22.433 --> 19:23.700
- You could have issues.
You can't even get on

19:23.734 --> 19:26.200
with your best friend,
so you could have issues.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.567
- Oh!
- PK!

19:28.600 --> 19:30.667
- But the hard part is then
he goes, "Well, we're good.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.300
Me and Ken are good.
Me and Vanderpump are good."

19:32.333 --> 19:33.700
- That doesn't matter.

19:33.734 --> 19:34.700
I'm not talking about that
right now, Teddi.

19:34.734 --> 19:36.700
And do me a favor.

19:36.734 --> 19:39.567
Let me have a conversation
with Kyle for two seconds.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.667
Teddi, by nature, has
a tendency to insert herself,

19:42.700 --> 19:46.567
and I think Teddi
can be Kyle's henchwoman.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.467
- It's just men say
stupid sh-- sometimes.

19:48.500 --> 19:51.266
- But I also think this
situation put everybody

19:51.300 --> 19:52.700
in an uncomfortable way.
- Yes.

19:52.734 --> 19:54.533
- So even if
it's not malicious,

19:54.567 --> 19:57.667
you're deliberately trying
to cover your own ass.

19:57.700 --> 20:01.433
- Teddi and her big mouth,
know-it-all Teddi.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.266
- I think it was PK acting out

20:03.300 --> 20:04.734
on how he felt
about the situation.

20:04.767 --> 20:06.734
- I know you do.

20:06.767 --> 20:10.700
- Sometimes, Teddi, I think you
insinuate yourself

20:10.734 --> 20:13.467
and you're very bright,
but I don't--I agree.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.734
- She said I'm very bright.
Thank you.

20:15.767 --> 20:18.033
- Thank you for your approval.

20:18.066 --> 20:20.333
- All right.
- Whew.

20:20.367 --> 20:21.734
- Um...
- Wah-wah.

20:21.767 --> 20:25.300
- You know, you two
do seem genuinely close.

20:25.333 --> 20:28.333
What made you go
from casual friends to besties?

20:28.367 --> 20:29.734
When did that happen?

20:29.767 --> 20:31.600
- I think we clicked during
the first season

20:31.633 --> 20:33.000
when I met everybody.

20:33.033 --> 20:34.700
Oh, I love it.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.033
- Do you?
- Yes.

20:36.066 --> 20:37.266
- I think it's
really beautiful.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.467
- Does this look ridiculous?

20:38.500 --> 20:40.033
- No.
- This looks so good.

20:40.066 --> 20:42.433
- What would I have done
without you on this trip?

20:42.467 --> 20:45.700
- Okay, wait till it's done.
- Oh (BLEEP).

20:45.734 --> 20:47.734
- Close your eyes.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.734
I never feel, like,
appreciated by Lisa,

20:49.767 --> 20:51.700
and this is a perfect example.

20:51.734 --> 20:53.500
- I think Lisa does not know
what the (BLEEP) to do

20:53.533 --> 20:55.600
about somebody
talking bad about her.

20:55.633 --> 20:58.367
We really became immersed
in each other's lives.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.066
- April from Danbury,
Connecticut,

21:00.100 --> 21:02.266
thinks the two of you
are codependent.

21:02.300 --> 21:04.367
- Is she a therapist?
No, I'm just kidding.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.367
- You're watching us, you know,
travel together,

21:06.400 --> 21:07.767
do things together,
that's not--

21:08.000 --> 21:09.400
- I think it's great
that you guys have formed

21:09.433 --> 21:10.633
such a close friendship.

21:10.667 --> 21:12.367
- Kyle gets to be
the big sister.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.633
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Right. Right.

21:14.667 --> 21:16.433
- Camille, someone tweeted,

21:16.467 --> 21:19.266
"Kyle is like a teenager
crushing on Teddi,"

21:19.300 --> 21:22.500
and you agreed that their
friendship is, quote, creepy.

21:22.533 --> 21:25.400
Why do you say that?
- I'd love to hear.

21:25.433 --> 21:29.400
- I just felt that Teddi was,
like, up Kyle's ass.

21:29.433 --> 21:31.633
I'm gonna be honest. I mean,
I just felt that it was--

21:31.667 --> 21:33.400
- In what way?
- In what way?

21:33.433 --> 21:35.000
- And asking her to be
your bridesmaid

21:35.033 --> 21:37.533
when you don't hang out
outside of the show isn't?

21:37.567 --> 21:39.667
- Well, I've known her
for a very long time, and--

21:39.700 --> 21:41.533
- Okay, but you hang out?
You spend time with each other?

21:41.567 --> 21:43.333
- I haven't seen her
much this year,

21:43.367 --> 21:45.700
since you've put yourself
into her life.

21:45.734 --> 21:47.033
- Oh, it's my fault.

21:47.066 --> 21:48.767
- No, it's not
your fault at all.

21:49.000 --> 21:49.767
- Okay, I just want to get
to the bottom

21:50.000 --> 21:51.533
of what the issue is here.

21:51.567 --> 21:53.333
- You know, you made sure
that as soon as

21:53.367 --> 21:55.600
Lisa Vanderpump was out
that you were right there.

21:55.633 --> 21:57.000
- One has nothing to do
with the other.

21:57.033 --> 21:59.133
- I was close with Kyle
way prior

21:59.166 --> 22:00.734
to anything happening
with Lisa.

22:00.767 --> 22:02.400
- Okay, that's fine,
but it just seems like--

22:02.433 --> 22:04.300
that's how it comes across,
that's all.

22:04.333 --> 22:06.767
- So what about this friendship
is creepy to you?

22:07.000 --> 22:09.400
- It was--
- Just that Teddi's up her ass?

22:09.433 --> 22:11.734
- Anytime you want to have
a conversation with Kyle,

22:11.767 --> 22:15.033
Teddi's there
to cut you off,

22:15.066 --> 22:17.467
and that's annoying because
I've known her for ten years.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.367
I'd like to just speak to Kyle
just one on one.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.734
- I have a--I have a question.
I'm cutting you off, but--

22:21.767 --> 22:25.033
- Okay. God, there you go!
There's my point.

22:25.066 --> 22:27.700
[tense music]

22:27.734 --> 22:29.734
Mm-hmm.

22:29.767 --> 22:31.700
- Coming up...

22:31.734 --> 22:33.033
- This is totally a setup.
- What is a setup?

22:33.066 --> 22:34.600
- I'm done.
- Setup?

22:34.633 --> 22:36.600
- I'm done.
- What are you talking about?

22:36.633 --> 22:39.100
- I'm done.
- She's ----ing nuts.

22:39.133 --> 22:42.066
- Those ----ing nasty bitches.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.467
- So what about this friendship

22:48.467 --> 22:48.767
- So what about this friendship
is creepy to you?

22:50.433 --> 22:52.700
- It was--
- Just that Teddi's up her ass?

22:52.734 --> 22:55.200
- Anytime you want to have
a conversation with Kyle,

22:55.233 --> 22:58.133
Teddi's there
to cut you off,

22:58.166 --> 23:01.066
and that's annoying because
I've known her for ten years.

23:01.100 --> 23:03.233
I'd like to just speak
to Kyle just one on one.

23:03.266 --> 23:06.000
- I have a--I have a question.
I'm cutting you off, but--

23:06.033 --> 23:11.133
- Okay, God, there you go,
There's my point.

23:11.166 --> 23:13.500
- Why is it okay
for you to do it,

23:13.533 --> 23:15.467
but when I do it,
it's 'cause I'm up Kyle's ass?

23:15.500 --> 23:18.133
- I just feel like you're
much more opinionated

23:18.166 --> 23:20.734
than some of us here
when you don't need to be.

23:20.767 --> 23:23.100
- Dorit, how do you feel
about this?

23:23.133 --> 23:25.500
- I've watched them get close.
- Mm-hmm.

23:25.533 --> 23:28.000
- And I think they have
a nice friendship.

23:28.033 --> 23:30.033
I do find
that they sometimes--

23:30.066 --> 23:32.200
it's like you can't even have
a conversation with one

23:32.233 --> 23:35.100
without the other having
the exact same opinion

23:35.133 --> 23:37.533
and immediately saying it.
- Yeah.

23:37.567 --> 23:39.700
- Teddi also found herself
in the middle of an argument

23:39.734 --> 23:42.433
with Kyle
and Erika in Provence.

23:42.467 --> 23:45.767
- But I think you were
irritated last night.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.567
- Because it was making
something out of nothing.

23:48.600 --> 23:50.100
- If someone's like,
"I'm Kyle.

23:50.133 --> 23:52.133
I'm gonna be a ----ing asshole,
blah, blah,"

23:52.166 --> 23:53.700
I'd be like, that's weird.

23:53.734 --> 23:55.433
I don't think you enjoy
being with us.

23:55.467 --> 23:56.667
- I don't.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.066
- Now I'm feeling
a little bullied,

23:58.100 --> 23:59.767
and maybe I should go
to bed now.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.533
- I actually
enjoy being with you.

24:01.567 --> 24:03.200
- Erika--
- Look at me.

24:03.233 --> 24:06.033
I'm so ----ing offended.

24:06.066 --> 24:08.133
Now you guys want
to make up sh--.

24:08.166 --> 24:09.667
- I think Erika--
- Keep going.

24:09.700 --> 24:11.600
- Erika.
- Keep going.

24:11.633 --> 24:13.266
- Erika!
[door slams]

24:13.300 --> 24:15.600
- But first I want to talk
about what led up to that,

24:15.633 --> 24:20.033
Farrahween and other
Erika Jayne.

24:20.066 --> 24:22.033
- Hi, I'm Erika Jayne.
- Hi.

24:22.066 --> 24:23.767
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

24:24.000 --> 24:27.667
- I'm good. Giving Lisa Rinna
that bunny was really (BLEEP).

24:27.700 --> 24:29.767
- Okay, let's take a picture.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.567
- So Sebastian from Miami said,

24:31.600 --> 24:33.734
"Where did Lisa Rinna
go to acting school?

24:33.767 --> 24:37.033
That was a bad impression
of Erika Jayne."

24:37.066 --> 24:40.767
The costume was great.
How was--how was her persona?

24:41.000 --> 24:45.266
- You know, it's Lisa Rinna's
take on Erika Jayne.

24:45.300 --> 24:48.033
- You have to remember,
I wasn't on stage performing.

24:48.066 --> 24:50.734
I was in a Halloween costume
being Erika Jayne

24:50.767 --> 24:52.533
how I wanted to be Erika Jayne.

24:52.567 --> 24:54.033
- And Erika Jayne
doesn't have a script.

24:54.066 --> 24:55.700
I mean, she represents
certain adjectives--

24:55.734 --> 24:57.700
- I love that we're talking
about her in the third person.

24:57.734 --> 24:59.633
- She felt free.
She felt, you know--

24:59.667 --> 25:01.166
- I'll tell you what.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.700
It was one of the most
fun nights I've ever had.

25:02.734 --> 25:04.266
- Is that right?
- I laughed.

25:04.300 --> 25:06.133
- And you looked amazing.

25:06.166 --> 25:09.233
- For me, when that happened
that night and, you know,

25:09.266 --> 25:11.200
Rinna gave her
the finger and said that--

25:11.233 --> 25:14.734
- Rinna, Erika's not
that big of a bitch.

25:14.767 --> 25:16.033
- Oh, my God.
- Oh-oh.

25:16.066 --> 25:17.300
- Now I'm getting worried.

25:17.333 --> 25:18.600
- I feel like that's
intended for me.

25:18.633 --> 25:20.166
- Rinna, get over here.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.700
- I felt uncomfortable being
in a photo with Kim.

25:22.734 --> 25:24.567
- Got it.
- It was just that.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.300
- So when she was giving
the finger, I was thinking,

25:26.333 --> 25:28.100
"Erika would never do that."

25:28.133 --> 25:30.633
- In Provence, Kyle and Teddi

25:30.667 --> 25:32.567
both seemed
to be on the same page

25:32.600 --> 25:36.000
thinking that Erika
should have been offended

25:36.033 --> 25:38.700
by Lisa Rinna's impression
of her.

25:38.734 --> 25:41.066
- Is Erika Jayne--and I know--
- Stop.

25:41.100 --> 25:43.133
It's a performance persona.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.567
- So just explain it to--
I'm not being an idiot.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.000
- I didn't call you an idiot.

25:47.033 --> 25:48.633
I just said
it's a performance persona.

25:48.667 --> 25:50.567
- Teddi, you didn't have a dog
in the fight.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.000
Why were you upset about it?

25:52.033 --> 25:54.567
- I wish after the first
conversation that we had

25:54.600 --> 25:56.633
at that first dinner
I would have let it go.

25:56.667 --> 25:58.533
Had I been in the
right state of mind--

25:58.567 --> 26:00.266
and I'm not making excuses
for it--

26:00.300 --> 26:02.100
I would have never
brought it up again.

26:02.133 --> 26:04.066
- You weren't a part of it.
You don't know about it.

26:04.100 --> 26:06.734
So it's even more interesting
that you had so much

26:06.767 --> 26:08.533
to say about it 'cause
you weren't even there.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.000
- I know.
-You know.

26:10.033 --> 26:11.700
- I think
I internalize things

26:11.734 --> 26:14.700
and how I would take them,
and I projected that on her.

26:14.734 --> 26:16.166
- Why is it okay for Kyle

26:16.200 --> 26:19.233
to do an unflattering
impersonation of you?

26:19.266 --> 26:21.633
- Like she got off a horse.
[laughter]

26:24.333 --> 26:29.000
Can I tell you something?
That was a lot last night.

26:29.033 --> 26:31.033
I cannot.

26:32.734 --> 26:36.700
- But Rinna can't do
one of Erika?

26:36.734 --> 26:39.767
- Well, I--
I think it was more--

26:40.000 --> 26:41.667
in my opinion,
it was more of the excuse.

26:41.700 --> 26:44.000
- Well, but I was doing
what Teddi would have done.

26:44.033 --> 26:46.100
- Yeah, no, that's the truth.
I mean, I think we were

26:46.133 --> 26:49.000
also joking versus
that wasn't a joke.

26:49.033 --> 26:50.400
- Why do you two think

26:50.433 --> 26:52.600
that Erika doesn't want
to be around you?

26:52.633 --> 26:54.600
- It's just a little mood
that I tend

26:54.633 --> 26:56.133
to take personally and think,

26:56.166 --> 26:58.066
"Is it something I'm--or
does she not want to be--"

26:58.100 --> 27:00.000
- But she had a migraine too.
- Yeah, she did.

27:00.033 --> 27:01.600
- I think it was
those two mornings in a row

27:01.633 --> 27:03.400
when we were both like,
"Sh--, what's going on?"

27:03.433 --> 27:06.000
- I'm miserable.
- Are you?

27:06.033 --> 27:07.133
- Oh, honey, look at me.

27:07.166 --> 27:09.233
I'm at breakfast
with ----ing sunglasses.

27:09.266 --> 27:11.233
- Hello.
- Morning.

27:11.266 --> 27:13.400
- How are you, girl?
How'd you sleep?

27:13.433 --> 27:16.000
- I have a bit of a migraine.

27:16.033 --> 27:18.133
Meanwhile, I had
the best time of my life.

27:18.166 --> 27:22.233
- Really? Did something happen
at the airport at Starbucks?

27:22.266 --> 27:24.033
- What?

27:24.066 --> 27:26.000
- We were all in line
at Starbucks, and the--

27:26.033 --> 27:28.033
you were just not
in a good mood,

27:28.066 --> 27:30.266
and then the guy went to take
our order in front of you,

27:30.300 --> 27:32.266
and you snapped at him,
and then everybody like,

27:32.300 --> 27:35.233
oh, she's not in a good mood.
- I don't remember this.

27:35.266 --> 27:37.233
- And then it was that combined
with the morning things

27:37.266 --> 27:38.734
that I was like,
maybe she doesn't want

27:38.767 --> 27:40.100
to be here with us.
- No.

27:40.133 --> 27:42.000
- And then that's what it was.

27:42.033 --> 27:43.633
- Do you like being around
this group of women?

27:43.667 --> 27:45.633
- I like being around
this group of women.

27:45.667 --> 27:48.100
- What did you think about Kyle
saying that she likes to be

27:48.133 --> 27:52.200
around drunk Lisa Rinna,
but sober Rinna is boring?

27:52.233 --> 27:54.100
- Boring? Drunk Rinna's
really pretty fun.

27:54.133 --> 27:57.033
I can't--I guess
I can't blame her.

27:57.066 --> 27:58.333
- Drunk Rinna is fun.

27:58.367 --> 28:00.767
Like, look at--
look at your baby shower.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.033
[crowd cheering]

28:06.367 --> 28:08.033
I like that Rinna.

28:08.066 --> 28:10.033
- You kinda can't beat
Drunk Rinna.

28:10.066 --> 28:11.700
- I agree. I agree.

28:11.734 --> 28:14.400
But then she went on to say
sober Erika is even worse.

28:14.433 --> 28:18.066
- Was worse, was worse, yeah.
Well, hey, you know?

28:18.100 --> 28:21.066
- I love a drunk Rinna.
Sober Rinna is so boring.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.467
- Oh, my God,
I love a drunk Rinna.

28:22.500 --> 28:25.000
- I'm like, [fake snores]
"Don't bore me."

28:25.033 --> 28:26.266
- A drunk Rinna is so good.

28:26.300 --> 28:28.333
- And sober Erika's worse.

28:28.367 --> 28:29.700
I said sober Erika's worse?

28:29.734 --> 28:32.033
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:32.066 --> 28:33.767
- Drunk Rinna's better,

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
but sober Erika's even
double worse, or something.

28:37.033 --> 28:42.033
- When Erika left, Teddi told
Rinna Erika was fake.

28:42.066 --> 28:44.500
- She does what she needs to do

28:44.533 --> 28:46.033
to make you feel good,
but then--

28:46.066 --> 28:48.000
- What's wrong with that?

28:48.033 --> 28:50.133
- That's fine in
a fake relationship.

28:50.166 --> 28:52.233
- You think that's fake?

28:52.266 --> 28:54.066
- I know the same sh--.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.667
- I think you guys know
me well enough to know

28:56.700 --> 28:58.734
if I do something,
I really mean it.

28:58.767 --> 29:02.100
- Camille, does that seem
two-faced to you?

29:02.133 --> 29:06.734
- Yes, hypocrisy at its finest.
- You were sh-- faced.

29:06.767 --> 29:09.066
- But, like, I--but I don't
remember that conversation,

29:09.100 --> 29:10.767
but having to watch it back--

29:11.000 --> 29:13.133
- Was it pretend amnesia or
does she really not remember?

29:13.166 --> 29:15.133
- It wasn't pretend amnesia.
- No, no.

29:15.166 --> 29:17.367
- That was a funny line but no,
that was unfortunately full--

29:17.400 --> 29:19.066
- Is this pretend amnesia?
I have no idea.

29:19.100 --> 29:20.433
- So be accountable now
and tell me

29:20.467 --> 29:22.400
if you think
Erika was being fake.

29:22.433 --> 29:24.367
- I don't think Erika
was being fake,

29:24.400 --> 29:27.400
but I think those mornings in
Provence were rough, and it--

29:27.433 --> 29:29.233
- Yeah, they were rough,
from the inside out.

29:29.266 --> 29:32.266
- So why did you say it?
Just drunk?

29:32.300 --> 29:34.133
- I think because
I was paranoid,

29:34.166 --> 29:35.767
and instead of me going,

29:36.000 --> 29:37.367
"Gosh, something must be
going on with Erika,"

29:37.400 --> 29:40.000
I'm like, "Sh--, she's
coming for me for something.

29:40.033 --> 29:42.400
Something's gonna happen.
What's gonna happen now?"

29:42.433 --> 29:45.767
I mean, my guard is up.

29:49.033 --> 29:50.500
- Coming up...

29:50.533 --> 29:52.233
- You can still say
she has terrible breath

29:52.266 --> 29:53.767
and her gums are receding.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.734
- That was a joke,
and you all laughed!

30:01.633 --> 30:02.133
- Welcome back to

30:03.600 --> 30:05.400
"The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills" reunion.

30:05.433 --> 30:08.033
So Camille, what is your
opinion about Lisa Vanderpump

30:08.066 --> 30:10.500
not being here today?
- I think she should be here.

30:10.533 --> 30:13.166
- Why do you think she's not?
- Just for me?

30:13.200 --> 30:14.533
- Yeah.
- She's pissed about Brandi.

30:14.567 --> 30:16.333
- Why?
- Liar.

30:16.367 --> 30:20.166
- There's some story that they
think Lisa Vanderpump

30:20.200 --> 30:22.400
planted in--I think
it was Radar Online

30:22.433 --> 30:24.033
or one of those failing--

30:24.066 --> 30:26.066
- She does have a direct
hotline to Radar Online,

30:26.100 --> 30:27.233
to be honest.

30:27.266 --> 30:28.467
- And I don't know her
well enough to know

30:28.500 --> 30:30.300
if she leaked it or not.

30:30.333 --> 30:32.300
- Well, she did, for sure.
- She's pissed about Brandi?

30:32.333 --> 30:34.600
- She's not more pissed that
she hurt two people?

30:34.633 --> 30:36.400
She's more pissed at Brandi?

30:36.433 --> 30:38.166
- Showed up on the show,
absolutely.

30:38.200 --> 30:41.367
She's her arch-enemy.
She feels so betrayed.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.467
I'm just assuming, and I
could be absolutely wrong,

30:43.500 --> 30:46.033
but she felt
throughout this season

30:46.066 --> 30:47.567
that you've
had her back, Denise,

30:47.600 --> 30:50.367
and with you
talking to Brandi...

30:50.400 --> 30:52.166
- I didn't even think
about that.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.066
- Brandi's her arch-enemy.

30:54.100 --> 30:56.200
- We didn't meet to talk about
Lisa Vanderpump. It was--

30:56.233 --> 30:58.266
- Well, why didn't she
come here and say that?

30:58.300 --> 31:00.400
- That's just my theory.
That's just my theory.

31:00.433 --> 31:03.133
- I am so new
to so many of you.

31:03.166 --> 31:04.233
- And neutral.
- And neutral.

31:04.266 --> 31:06.000
- And I'm neutral.
- She's neutral.

31:06.033 --> 31:07.467
- And I didn't meet her to--
- Look, you--

31:07.500 --> 31:09.533
- Camille, are you still
in contact with Lisa?

31:09.567 --> 31:11.266
- We texted last week.

31:11.300 --> 31:13.066
- You did?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

31:13.100 --> 31:14.333
- I know she
was furious at you

31:14.367 --> 31:15.533
for what you said
about her on the show.

31:15.567 --> 31:17.200
- Oh, absolutely.
- Yeah.

31:17.233 --> 31:19.367
- Before Lisa Vanderpump
got her teeth redone,

31:19.400 --> 31:22.600
I had an issue with the--I had
such an issue with the gums.

31:22.633 --> 31:25.166
I was like,
"Honey, you need new caps.

31:25.200 --> 31:28.467
Your gum line is receding,
and that's--"

31:28.500 --> 31:31.433
- I'm done.
- She was very, very upset

31:31.467 --> 31:33.066
because she said
once it's out there,

31:33.100 --> 31:34.600
it's out there,
and she's right.

31:34.633 --> 31:36.400
- She should focus, you know,

31:36.433 --> 31:38.567
more on what comes out
of her mouth and less

31:38.600 --> 31:41.266
on what's in mine, right?
- Um, yeah.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.500
- I mean, my gums
are beautiful.

31:42.533 --> 31:44.100
Do you want
to check them out?

31:44.133 --> 31:46.133
- She has tweeted at you
quite a bit.

31:46.166 --> 31:48.133
- Oh, my God,
she's tweeted at me.

31:48.166 --> 31:50.400
She's texted me.
She was so angry.

31:50.433 --> 31:52.100
- Yeah.
- Camille, do you think

31:52.133 --> 31:53.600
Vanderpump would still have
invited you to Vegas

31:53.633 --> 31:56.133
if she knew what you said
about her breath?

31:56.166 --> 31:57.367
- No, no, not at all.

31:57.400 --> 31:58.700
- Okay, I want to move on
to something else.

31:58.734 --> 32:00.567
- Okay.
- The Strange Case of

32:00.600 --> 32:03.567
Dr. Jekyll
and Mrs. Grammer-Meyer

32:03.600 --> 32:06.500
is a tale of backstabbing,
betrayal,

32:06.533 --> 32:08.667
and hitting below the belt.

32:08.700 --> 32:10.633
- I did do that.
- Sometimes two faces

32:10.667 --> 32:13.333
are not better than one.
Take a look.

32:13.367 --> 32:15.066
- What I've noticed about you
is you like

32:15.100 --> 32:16.667
to talk out of the side
of your mouth,

32:16.700 --> 32:18.300
but the second you're
with somebody to their face,

32:18.333 --> 32:20.367
you back down.
- My face is right here.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.133
Teddi needs to take a seat.

32:22.166 --> 32:24.233
She sounds like
an entitled millennial.

32:24.266 --> 32:26.667
I think Teddi should
stay out of that.

32:26.700 --> 32:28.633
I just feel like she's a bit
of a know-it-all.

32:28.667 --> 32:30.700
- Camille struggles with being
straight-up and honest.

32:30.734 --> 32:33.166
She will play to both sides
of the fence.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.567
- What happened to Vanderpump?
She's not here.

32:35.600 --> 32:36.667
- You invited her?

32:36.700 --> 32:38.233
- Of course I invited
her, yeah.

32:38.266 --> 32:39.633
- She should have showed up.

32:39.667 --> 32:42.266
- She said that
she wasn't invited.

32:42.300 --> 32:43.633
- Stop.

32:43.667 --> 32:45.133
- I said, I didn't know
you weren't invited.

32:45.166 --> 32:46.467
Nobody's telling me that.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.166
Of course I would
have wanted you there.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.166
- Camille just says,
"Oh, I didn't realize

32:50.200 --> 32:52.333
you weren't invited."
You know she was invited.

32:52.367 --> 32:54.600
- Oh, I said I didn't
know that. I'm sorry.

32:54.633 --> 32:56.467
- But you did.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.266
- You are right about that.
Call me out on that sh--.

32:58.300 --> 33:02.633
We've all experienced this,
the wrath of Vanderpump,

33:02.667 --> 33:07.200
and it feels terrible because
it's a character assassination.

33:07.233 --> 33:09.266
- I don't want to spend
any time around them.

33:09.300 --> 33:11.400
- I really want you there,
but I understand

33:11.433 --> 33:13.567
because I would hate for you
to come to my wedding feeling

33:13.600 --> 33:15.467
all this pressure
from the ladies.

33:15.500 --> 33:17.633
- Wish-washy.

33:17.667 --> 33:20.734
You got the wish,
and you got the wash,

33:20.767 --> 33:22.667
and then you got Camille.

33:22.700 --> 33:24.734
- The accusation here
is that you talk out

33:24.767 --> 33:26.567
of both sides of your mouth.
- Mm-hmm.

33:26.600 --> 33:29.700
- So is there anything that
you saw in that piece

33:29.734 --> 33:33.500
that made you understand
where they're coming from?

33:33.533 --> 33:35.200
- Yes.

33:35.233 --> 33:37.700
Watching that, the way
that's put together, yes, yes.

33:37.734 --> 33:39.233
- You think it was
the editing

33:39.266 --> 33:41.200
that made it look like that?

33:41.233 --> 33:43.300
- No, no, no, I'm not
going all for that, but yes.

33:43.333 --> 33:45.133
What part of it
do you want me to explain?

33:45.166 --> 33:47.567
- The accusation is you say
one thing to us,

33:47.600 --> 33:50.200
and you say another thing to--
- No, but here's what happens.

33:50.233 --> 33:51.700
When we're together,
you will say things like,

33:51.734 --> 33:53.600
"I know how Lisa is.

33:53.633 --> 33:55.300
She's done this to me.
She's done that and this,"

33:55.333 --> 33:56.767
and then when you're not
with us, you're like,

33:57.000 --> 33:58.433
"Lisa, I feel so bad
what you're going through,

33:58.467 --> 33:59.700
and this--" and then you--

33:59.734 --> 34:01.767
- Can I feel both?
Can I--I can feel both.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.700
- Not if they contradict
one another.

34:03.734 --> 34:05.266
- No, I'm not contradicting.

34:05.300 --> 34:06.767
- You've got to
have conviction.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
- Okay, I'm convict--
my conviction is

34:09.033 --> 34:11.333
I felt terrible
that her brother passed away.

34:11.367 --> 34:13.000
- Of course.
- We all did.

34:13.033 --> 34:14.667
- We all did.
- What human being wouldn't?

34:14.699 --> 34:16.533
- We all did. This has nothing
to do with any of this.

34:16.567 --> 34:18.533
- But you can still say
she has terrible breath

34:18.567 --> 34:19.766
and her gums are receding?

34:20.000 --> 34:21.699
- That was a joke,
and you all laughed!

34:21.734 --> 34:24.333
And you all laughed,
and you continued

34:24.367 --> 34:26.199
with the conversation and said,
"Yes, don't get me into it,

34:26.233 --> 34:27.333
but she's always
had bad breath."

34:27.367 --> 34:28.467
- I did--I--
- Yes, you have.

34:28.500 --> 34:29.734
That is bullsh--.

34:29.766 --> 34:31.766
You've talked about that
off-camera with me.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.766
- Camille, that's
such a ----ing low blow.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.667
We've all said things
privately about each other.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.433
I would never out you.

34:37.467 --> 34:39.400
If I did right now, it would
be a very bad situation.

34:39.433 --> 34:42.033
I don't do that.
- You girls have all talked

34:42.065 --> 34:44.000
about each other
behind each other's back.

34:44.033 --> 34:46.033
I don't know about her,
but all of you.

34:46.065 --> 34:48.033
- I'm really sure I have.
- Okay.

34:48.065 --> 34:50.199
I mean, come on,
this is hypocrisy

34:50.233 --> 34:51.667
at its finest right now.
- No, Camille.

34:51.699 --> 34:55.300
- You have wanted me to be mad
at Lisa Vanderpump.

34:55.333 --> 34:56.734
Listen, if you're mad at us...
- You have.

34:56.766 --> 35:00.033
- And agree with Lisa, great.
Then stick by that.

35:00.066 --> 35:01.734
But you can't go
back and forth.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.767
You go with Lisa,
and you talk bad, and you go,

35:04.000 --> 35:05.667
"I--it's so awful
what they've been doing,"

35:05.700 --> 35:07.433
and then you go to us,
and what I'm saying is--

35:07.467 --> 35:09.567
- Yes, I can have two
independent thoughts.

35:09.600 --> 35:12.200
They're independent of
each other, and I own that.

35:12.233 --> 35:13.600
- While you're trying
to please everybody,

35:13.633 --> 35:15.433
you end up pissing
everyone off

35:15.467 --> 35:17.200
because you're not standing up
for one thing. Like--

35:17.233 --> 35:19.567
- What's the one thing
you want me to stand up for?

35:19.600 --> 35:21.367
- Just be honest.

35:21.400 --> 35:23.533
- I feel like you girls want me
to jump on that hate train.

35:23.567 --> 35:25.066
- That's not true.

35:25.100 --> 35:27.333
Camille, quit saying
it's a hate train.

35:27.367 --> 35:31.000
- You do a good job on your own
jumping on your own hate train.

35:31.033 --> 35:33.266
- Oh, please, Erika.
You're su--I mean, not Erika.

35:33.300 --> 35:35.000
- I'm Erika.
- No, um, Dorit,

35:35.033 --> 35:37.000
you're the most phoniest
person I've ever met.

35:37.033 --> 35:38.734
- Yeah, we have yet to have
that conversation.

35:38.767 --> 35:40.433
-You are such a fake.
Don't even go there.

35:40.467 --> 35:41.767
- Can I--
- Go ahead.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.467
- Why would you say
Dorit is phony?

35:43.500 --> 35:45.300
I think she's worked
really hard--let me just--

35:45.333 --> 35:47.066
- I just--
I have a thing about her.

35:47.100 --> 35:48.734
- Just let me get it out.
- I really do, Erika.

35:48.767 --> 35:51.300
I just have a thing about her.
- But I think she--

35:51.333 --> 35:52.600
- I don't like
when people pretend

35:52.633 --> 35:54.033
that they're somebody
they're not.

35:54.066 --> 35:55.700
It really drives me crazy.

35:55.734 --> 35:58.700
I've been around this town
for so long,

35:58.734 --> 36:01.734
and you show up,
and I don't know.

36:01.767 --> 36:04.033
It's something about you,
Dorit.

36:04.066 --> 36:05.633
I just don't feel that
you're sincere at times.

36:05.667 --> 36:07.300
- But what is it, Camille?

36:07.333 --> 36:09.367
- You are perfectly entitled
to your opinion.

36:09.400 --> 36:12.100
- Mm-hmm.
- The only thing I ask is that

36:12.133 --> 36:14.467
you actually
are honest about it

36:14.500 --> 36:17.066
and don't pretend
that you like me.

36:17.100 --> 36:18.500
- We're getting to know
each other,

36:18.533 --> 36:20.400
and the more time
I spend with you,

36:20.433 --> 36:21.767
the more I feel bad
for anything

36:22.000 --> 36:24.333
I've ever said
in the past, really.

36:24.367 --> 36:25.767
- And that you want
to be friends

36:26.000 --> 36:27.633
and invite me
to such big moments.

36:27.667 --> 36:29.266
- Mm-hmm, I have tried.
I have tried.

36:29.300 --> 36:31.000
- Like your wedding
and your 50th birthday.

36:31.033 --> 36:32.333
- Well, that was production.

36:32.367 --> 36:34.600
- No, that's not production.
Nice try.

36:34.633 --> 36:37.100
- But no, but that is
the truth because I didn't want

36:37.133 --> 36:38.600
to invite any of you ladies
to my wedding, honestly.

36:38.633 --> 36:40.066
- Oh, wow!
- Oh, that's great.

36:40.100 --> 36:42.500
- Okay, hold on. Hold on.
- But that is the truth.

36:42.533 --> 36:44.367
- Okay, you have power
over yourself.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.734
- You can't say that.
There has to be something else.

36:45.767 --> 36:47.667
Nobody forces you--

36:47.700 --> 36:50.000
- You have power over yourself.
I mean, you do.

36:50.033 --> 36:53.000
Let me ask you this.
It seemed like you then

36:53.033 --> 36:57.000
went all-in
about her finances and PK.

36:57.033 --> 36:59.633
- Your husband was telling me
how he filed for bankruptcy.

36:59.667 --> 37:01.133
He owes them a lot of money.

37:01.166 --> 37:03.000
- His business went bust.
- I know, but he owes

37:03.033 --> 37:05.633
that money to people
that I know personally.

37:05.667 --> 37:07.433
- Oh, plea--
- No, it's true.

37:07.467 --> 37:08.700
- What are you talking about?
- It's true.

37:08.734 --> 37:11.333
- You're a little snake.

37:11.367 --> 37:13.400
- Well, I walked into
that diner

37:13.433 --> 37:15.100
not knowing
I was being ambushed.

37:15.133 --> 37:17.667
- Did it seem like an ambush?
- Absolutely.

37:17.700 --> 37:19.734
If you're hurt,
I need to know that.

37:19.767 --> 37:21.400
- No.
- We've been through a lot.

37:21.433 --> 37:23.000
You don't have to hear
from your friends--

37:23.033 --> 37:24.767
- No, no, no, please,
bring it up.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.033
- Camille, you are confusing.

37:27.066 --> 37:28.700
- After my assistant
passed away

37:28.734 --> 37:32.066
and after you ladies
trashed me in a van--

37:32.100 --> 37:33.333
- Trashed you?

37:33.367 --> 37:35.700
Camille needs
to own her sh-- now.

37:35.734 --> 37:37.567
- What a bitch.
- And she pretends--

37:37.600 --> 37:40.100
- Don't pretend to be
so sweet and nice and--

37:40.133 --> 37:42.633
don't do that to me.
- That's nasty!

37:42.667 --> 37:45.700
You don't come to my wedding
and then treat me

37:45.734 --> 37:47.600
so disrespectful after it.

37:47.633 --> 37:49.333
That was nasty.

37:49.367 --> 37:50.700
- But Camille, let's talk
about what they were--

37:50.734 --> 37:52.767
- Why can't I say
a nice thing about

37:53.000 --> 37:56.066
Lisa Vanderpump without you,
the Witches of Eastwick...

37:56.100 --> 37:59.000
- Oh, my God.
- Coming after me?

37:59.033 --> 38:01.367
♪ ♪

38:01.400 --> 38:02.700
- Coming up...

38:02.734 --> 38:05.433
- She told me to tell
my daughter

38:05.467 --> 38:06.500
she was a ----ing liar.

38:06.533 --> 38:08.667
- What?

38:14.000 --> 38:14.266
- That's nasty!

38:15.667 --> 38:18.100
You don't come to my wedding
and then treat me

38:18.133 --> 38:21.000
so disrespectful after it.
That was nasty.

38:21.033 --> 38:22.767
- But, Camille, let's talk
about what they were--let's--

38:23.000 --> 38:24.633
- Why can't I say
a nice thing about

38:24.667 --> 38:28.100
Lisa Vanderpump without you,
the Witches of Eastwick...

38:28.133 --> 38:30.400
- Oh, my God.
- Coming after me?

38:30.433 --> 38:32.200
- Camille, you're scared to say
things about Lisa Vanderpump

38:32.233 --> 38:34.100
because you're looking
at Twitter,

38:34.133 --> 38:36.000
and we all know that we all
get bashed on Twitter.

38:36.033 --> 38:38.000
- Not bashed, killed.
- So you'd be nice to Lisa,

38:38.033 --> 38:39.233
because you don't want
to deal with the bashing,

38:39.266 --> 38:40.700
and you think,
"Okay, well, I can tell

38:40.734 --> 38:42.066
Dorit, you know,
she's not genuine,"

38:42.100 --> 38:43.667
'cause you see this stuff
on Twitter.

38:43.700 --> 38:45.533
Just say what you feel
in the moment.

38:45.567 --> 38:48.400
- You're very upset about them
trashing you in the van

38:48.433 --> 38:50.233
leaving your wedding.
- Yes, I was.

38:50.266 --> 38:51.400
- So let's talk about
what they were saying.

38:51.433 --> 38:53.000
- I was furious.

38:53.033 --> 38:55.066
- We'd been at your wedding.
It was wonderful.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.600
You had been talking about
being very unhappy

38:57.633 --> 38:59.467
that Lisa Vanderpump
wasn't there.

38:59.500 --> 39:02.567
You were really hurt by it,
but it was really bad timing

39:02.600 --> 39:04.667
because we get sent this
"People" magazine article.

39:04.700 --> 39:07.133
She's basically saying she--
"Lisa Vanderpump

39:07.166 --> 39:10.467
encouraged me to take a leap
of faith on this journey,"

39:10.500 --> 39:13.500
and here she says,
"I respect her decision."

39:13.533 --> 39:17.133
You said so many amazing things
about Lisa Vanderpump,

39:17.166 --> 39:18.667
who didn't show up.

39:18.700 --> 39:21.166
- The interview was given
a week before.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.033
- The timing was bad though.
- The week before.

39:23.066 --> 39:24.567
- Can I say something?
There's so many people

39:24.600 --> 39:26.266
talking--talking
over each other.

39:26.300 --> 39:28.133
- The week before.
- It's so annoying.

39:28.166 --> 39:29.767
- Wait, let me say one thing.
It was a kneejerk reaction.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.133
I don't think
it was a great reaction.

39:32.166 --> 39:34.567
- I think it was an
overreaction after my wedding.

39:34.600 --> 39:37.467
- Well, but do you understand
why she was frustrated?

39:37.500 --> 39:39.133
- Yeah, do you understand that?

39:39.166 --> 39:42.133
- I understand, but it had
nothing against you girls.

39:42.166 --> 39:44.033
- But not that--
- There was nothing.

39:44.066 --> 39:45.567
- That wasn't their point.
That wasn't their point.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.033
- You had been very clear

39:47.066 --> 39:48.467
that Lisa's not been
a friend to you.

39:48.500 --> 39:51.033
- She should have been here
to be here for me

39:51.066 --> 39:53.166
and to dismiss all of this.

39:53.200 --> 39:56.533
Lisa Vanderpump has been
a fair-weather friend,

39:56.567 --> 39:58.033
absolutely.

39:58.066 --> 40:00.133
- Right, okay, so
with that said, you'll say,

40:00.166 --> 40:01.166
"She never calls me.
We never hang out.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.000
She never checks on me."

40:03.033 --> 40:04.300
Meanwhile we've left
our children

40:04.333 --> 40:06.233
and our families to be there
and support you.

40:06.266 --> 40:08.200
Whether you actually wanted us
there or not, I didn't realize.

40:08.233 --> 40:10.700
I mean, I thought that when you
asked me to be a bridesmaid,

40:10.734 --> 40:13.133
that I--maybe I'm stupid.
I thought it was genuine.

40:13.166 --> 40:15.233
- So do you get that? They're
the people who showed up.

40:15.266 --> 40:17.166
- Mm-hmm.
- She didn't, yet--

40:17.200 --> 40:18.633
- I understand that.

40:18.667 --> 40:21.066
- Okay. Okay.
- That I can understand.

40:21.100 --> 40:22.734
That right there
in that context--

40:22.767 --> 40:24.033
- Why are you so angry?

40:24.066 --> 40:25.767
- Okay.
- Okay.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.200
- Honest to God, like,
take it down a notch, Camille.

40:27.233 --> 40:29.300
- Denise, shut up.
- I mean, I can't--

40:29.333 --> 40:31.066
- Don't tell her
to shut up, Camille.

40:31.100 --> 40:32.333
Don't. She's my friend.
She's my friend.

40:32.367 --> 40:34.100
- I know she's your friend,
but I don't like her.

40:34.133 --> 40:36.066
- Camille, calm down,
for (BLEEP)'s sake.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.033
- I don't like her.

40:38.066 --> 40:41.266
She told me to tell my daughter
she was a ----ing liar.

40:41.300 --> 40:43.033
- What?

40:43.066 --> 40:44.300
- I did not tell you
to tell your daughter--

40:44.333 --> 40:46.033
- Yes, you did.
In the finale, yes.

40:46.066 --> 40:47.266
- I did not.
What are you talking about?

40:47.300 --> 40:49.133
- She did.
- Oh, by the way,

40:49.166 --> 40:50.767
my daughter
was upset with you.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.600
She walked up to you
and said hi, and you went,

40:52.633 --> 40:54.200
"I gotta go to the bathroom."

40:54.233 --> 40:55.767
- Never, I--never.
- "Gotta go to the bathroom."

40:56.000 --> 40:57.734
- You know what I would say
to my daughter.

40:57.767 --> 41:00.333
I would defend them
and I would make my daughter

41:00.367 --> 41:02.100
feel like they were--

41:02.133 --> 41:03.667
- Well, then maybe you make
your daughters feel like sh--,

41:03.700 --> 41:05.300
but I don't make my daughters
feel like sh--.

41:05.333 --> 41:07.100
- I don't make them feel
like ----ing sh--.

41:07.133 --> 41:10.000
I make them feel okay, like,
"Don't worry, honey.

41:10.033 --> 41:11.533
They didn't snub you."

41:11.567 --> 41:15.667
I said if my child said
that Teddi ignored her,

41:15.700 --> 41:17.667
whether she did or not,
I know Teddi,

41:17.700 --> 41:19.266
and I know she's a great mom.

41:19.300 --> 41:21.533
- And then your response
to Denise was,

41:21.567 --> 41:24.100
"It's not my fault that
I'm not a bad mother like you."

41:24.133 --> 41:26.066
Like, you put that on her.
- I didn't say that.

41:26.100 --> 41:27.533
- You actually insulted
my parenting, Camille.

41:27.567 --> 41:29.100
- I said I do not curse

41:29.133 --> 41:31.133
at my kids,
'cause you were telling me--

41:31.166 --> 41:34.000
- What are you talking about?
- You were telling me--

41:34.033 --> 41:35.367
- I have no idea.
- A while back you said,

41:35.400 --> 41:37.033
"I curse at my daughters."
It was no big deal.

41:37.066 --> 41:38.600
- I don't curse
at my daughters.

41:38.633 --> 41:40.233
- It was in the Bahamas.
You were drunk. You came in.

41:40.266 --> 41:42.266
- I--by the way, you and I
have talked about this.

41:42.300 --> 41:44.133
- Yeah.
- Like, I'm calm,

41:44.166 --> 41:46.133
but when I go,
I ----ing go.

41:46.166 --> 41:47.367
- She told me
that the other day.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.133
She was like,
"I scream at my kids.

41:49.166 --> 41:50.667
Do you scream at your kids?"
and I was like--

41:50.700 --> 41:52.133
- I scream my goddamn head
off at times.

41:52.166 --> 41:53.700
- You do?

41:53.734 --> 41:57.000
- Yes, because if I'm calm
after 50 times--

41:57.033 --> 41:59.033
- Do you feel bad after
or are you like--

41:59.066 --> 42:01.133
- I don't, actually.
[laughter]

42:01.166 --> 42:03.133
[overlapping talking]

42:03.166 --> 42:05.133
- That's unbelievable.

42:05.166 --> 42:07.000
- "Sometimes I just get mad at
my daughters and say things."

42:07.033 --> 42:09.100
- What is wrong with you?

42:09.133 --> 42:12.100
Honest to God,
you need to go take a second

42:12.133 --> 42:15.166
because this is not good.

42:17.066 --> 42:19.734
- When you were sitting there
at lunch with Camille

42:19.767 --> 42:21.333
and she was
trash-talking everyone,

42:21.367 --> 42:25.033
what was going
through your mind?

42:25.066 --> 42:26.600
- I was really uncomfortable
because I didn't want--

42:26.633 --> 42:28.033
- So this is--
this is truly a setup.

42:28.066 --> 42:29.266
This is truly a setup.

42:29.300 --> 42:31.066
- What is a setup?
- I'm done.

42:31.100 --> 42:32.333
- I'm done.
- What are you talking about?

42:32.367 --> 42:34.133
- I'm done.
- You did your own stuff on--

42:34.166 --> 42:37.300
- What are you talking about?
- I'm done.

42:37.333 --> 42:40.166
Bullsh--.
They did say those things.

42:40.200 --> 42:41.767
- Is she on something?

42:42.000 --> 42:44.033
- She did say she cursed
at her kids.

42:44.066 --> 42:48.100
----ing she did say that.
- She's so angry.

42:48.133 --> 42:49.600
- I'm not going through
that bullsh--.

42:49.633 --> 42:51.166
(BLEEP) them.

42:51.200 --> 42:54.033
- What's the setup?
- What happened?

42:54.066 --> 42:57.367
- She's ----ing nuts.
- Thank you.

42:57.400 --> 43:00.033
Take this off.
I'm leaving.

43:00.066 --> 43:04.100
Bullsh--.
Nasty bitches.

43:04.133 --> 43:07.100
- Next time,
it's part three of

43:07.133 --> 43:09.734
"The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills" reunion.

43:09.767 --> 43:12.734
- I can't figure out what
Denise's issue with me is.

43:12.767 --> 43:15.033
- You just said you didn't
like her and that she's boring.

43:15.066 --> 43:17.767
- She was kind of
a wah-wah this year.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.433
- Well, I'd say you
were just an asshole

43:19.467 --> 43:21.200
with iconic hair and lips.
- Big lips.

43:21.233 --> 43:22.700
- And lips.
- Yeah.

43:22.734 --> 43:24.767
- Oh, my God,
it's such a Lisa present.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.467
- Maybe after seeing that,
she'll call you.

43:26.500 --> 43:28.000
- I feel like I've seen
this on her.

43:28.033 --> 43:29.200
- You're just saying that

43:29.233 --> 43:30.700
'cause he wants
it for the clubhouse.

43:30.734 --> 43:32.066
- Oh, you want--
[laughter]

43:32.100 --> 43:34.133
- I'm really hurt
by you ladies.

43:34.166 --> 43:37.166
It was a great wedding,
and then Teddi said

43:37.200 --> 43:40.133
the best part of it
was the departure.

43:40.166 --> 43:43.734
- This is where we think
before we speak, Camille.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.133
You're talking out of your ass.

43:45.166 --> 43:47.100
- Denise, stop it.
It is not true.

43:47.133 --> 43:48.767
- Whatever you're telling me,

43:49.000 --> 43:51.233
I can't really trust
that that's real.

43:51.266 --> 43:53.000
- That's what
she's ----ing doing,

43:53.033 --> 43:54.400
and once again,
it's not being genuine.

43:54.433 --> 43:58.000
- [sighs] (BLEEP), man.
- It's a sad end.

43:58.033 --> 44:02.667
- Sorry, I can't--I can't
talk right now for a second.

44:02.700 --> 44:04.233
- To learn more about
the Housewives,

44:04.266 --> 44:06.200
