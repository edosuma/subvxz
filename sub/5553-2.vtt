WEBVTT

00:08.084 --> 00:09.183
Why are you up?

00:09.185 --> 00:10.484
How am I supposed to sleep?

00:10.486 --> 00:12.386
I've been married
less than 24 hours,

00:12.388 --> 00:14.221
and my wife
isn't speaking to me.

00:15.525 --> 00:18.592
Perhaps you can think of this
in a more positive light.

00:18.594 --> 00:21.162
In one day,
you've managed to do

00:21.164 --> 00:23.764
what it takes many couples
decades to achieve.

00:23.766 --> 00:25.699
(knocking on door)

00:26.502 --> 00:28.202
Hi.

00:28.204 --> 00:29.336
Hey.

00:29.338 --> 00:30.237
You couldn't sleep either?

00:30.239 --> 00:32.506
Of course not.

00:32.508 --> 00:33.674
Me neither.

00:33.676 --> 00:37.178
But I just had
a tickle in my throat.

00:37.180 --> 00:39.613
Not profound marital problems.

00:39.615 --> 00:41.448
What are we gonna do?

00:41.450 --> 00:42.650
I don't know.

00:42.652 --> 00:44.885
Please, tell me
how I can fix it.

00:44.887 --> 00:47.888
Glad you asked.

00:47.890 --> 00:50.424
As I see it, there's
a simple solution.

00:50.426 --> 00:53.594
Your lips had a dalliance
with the lips of another woman.

00:53.596 --> 00:55.529
It seems only
logical that

00:55.531 --> 00:57.198
to restore balance
to the relationship,

00:57.200 --> 01:00.267
you should find another man
and dally with him.

01:00.269 --> 01:02.636
And by dally,
I mean some hardcore

01:02.638 --> 01:04.370
mouth-on-mouth action.

01:04.373 --> 01:07.274
Okay, that is the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

01:07.276 --> 01:09.610
Actually, I think
he's onto something.

01:09.612 --> 01:11.378
Y-You can't be serious.

01:11.380 --> 01:14.315
'Cause I messed up
and made out with a girl,

01:14.317 --> 01:16.750
you're gonna do the same
with a random guy?

01:16.752 --> 01:19.420
I'm currently single.

01:20.957 --> 01:22.756
That's true. You are.

01:24.527 --> 01:26.994
What is happening?!

01:28.331 --> 01:29.964
I will tell you
what is happening.

01:29.966 --> 01:32.266
I am saving
my best friend's marriage.

02:12.318 --> 02:14.618
(Skype ringing)

02:14.620 --> 02:16.920
Sheldon, I don't think
you understand

02:16.922 --> 02:18.389
how being broken up works.

02:18.391 --> 02:20.658
The only way
I can sort through my feelings

02:20.660 --> 02:22.426
is if there is space between us.

02:22.428 --> 02:25.396
Every time I see you,
it re-traumatizes me.

02:25.398 --> 02:27.531
I go through the pain
all over again.

02:27.533 --> 02:29.700
Well, hello to you, too.

02:30.770 --> 02:32.469
What do you want?

02:32.471 --> 02:34.638
I understand
we're no longer a couple,

02:34.640 --> 02:38.208
but I would like to remind you
that we made a baby together.

02:40.413 --> 02:42.212
What baby?

02:42.214 --> 02:45.215
A precocious
little Internet show

02:45.217 --> 02:47.785
known as "Fun With Flags."

02:48.654 --> 02:50.287
I'm hanging up.

02:50.289 --> 02:52.423
Great. See you in
about half an hour.

02:52.425 --> 02:56.026
Sheldon, I am not doing
"Fun With Flags" with you.

02:56.028 --> 02:57.194
Why not?

02:57.196 --> 02:59.129
Because we're broken up.

02:59.131 --> 03:01.098
Sonny and Cher made it work.

03:01.100 --> 03:02.966
Their variety show
kept going

03:02.968 --> 03:04.034
long after the divorce,

03:04.036 --> 03:06.670
and here we are
still talking about them.

03:06.672 --> 03:09.873
No one's talking
about Sonny and Cher.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.909
You must be thinking
about Donny and Marie,

03:11.911 --> 03:14.545
'cause you and I are clearly
talking about Sonny and Cher.

03:15.981 --> 03:17.715
Sheldon, this has to stop.

03:17.717 --> 03:19.283
I know it's hard.

03:19.285 --> 03:20.984
It's hard for me, too.

03:20.986 --> 03:22.886
But I've seen
and talked to you more

03:22.888 --> 03:24.421
in the two days
we've been broken up

03:24.423 --> 03:27.124
than in the last two months
that we were together.

03:27.126 --> 03:28.792
Well, if you want
to see less of me,

03:28.794 --> 03:31.628
maybe we should go out again.

03:32.798 --> 03:34.965
I can't believe you made out
with Mandy Chao.

03:34.967 --> 03:37.000
Trust me,
I wish it never happened.

03:37.002 --> 03:39.403
And you knew about this
this whole time?

03:39.405 --> 03:40.604
I did.

03:40.606 --> 03:42.639
And you didn't think to tell me?

03:44.243 --> 03:46.577
Leonard asked me
to keep it to myself.

03:46.579 --> 03:48.912
Let's leave Leonard
out of this for the moment.

03:50.182 --> 03:52.716
This is about you and me.

03:54.086 --> 03:56.787
Wait, wait, wait, how is my
day-old marriage falling apart

03:56.789 --> 03:57.888
becoming about you two?

03:57.890 --> 03:59.056
Hang on.

03:59.058 --> 04:01.759
What do I need to do
to make you trust me?

04:01.761 --> 04:03.727
You think it's hard
having one wife,

04:03.729 --> 04:05.195
try having two.

04:06.298 --> 04:07.698
I bet you told Bernadette

04:07.700 --> 04:10.467
all about he was screwing around
with Mandy Chao.

04:10.469 --> 04:11.769
Oh, we didn't screw around.

04:11.771 --> 04:13.237
We just got drunk and made out.

04:13.239 --> 04:16.005
Whatever. It would have
been nice to hear it from you.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:29.655 --> 04:32.022
What are you doing here?

04:32.024 --> 04:34.458
I'm here to return
your belongings.

04:34.460 --> 04:36.460
That's what people
who've broken up do.

04:36.462 --> 04:39.696
And you didn't do
your compulsive knocking ritual

04:39.698 --> 04:41.298
so I would open the door.

04:41.300 --> 04:42.699
On the contrary,

04:42.701 --> 04:46.136
you no longer get to enjoy
my charming eccentricities.

04:47.473 --> 04:50.140
We're not friends with benefits.

04:51.377 --> 04:52.910
Just give me the box.

04:52.912 --> 04:54.778
W-Wait. Don't you want
to go through it

04:54.780 --> 04:56.613
to make sure
I haven't forgotten anything?

04:56.615 --> 04:58.816
Fine.

04:59.985 --> 05:01.718
My old scarf.

05:01.720 --> 05:04.288
You wore it the night
we went ice-skating. Remember?

05:04.290 --> 05:06.190
You mean the night
that I went ice-skating,

05:06.192 --> 05:07.524
and you stood at the rail

05:07.526 --> 05:09.760
Googling the symptoms
of hypothermia?

05:12.231 --> 05:14.898
We made one heck of a team, huh?

05:17.169 --> 05:19.369
Whose bra is this?

05:20.840 --> 05:22.339
It's not yours?

05:23.709 --> 05:25.375
Oh, my.

05:25.377 --> 05:27.544
How embarrassing for both of us.

05:29.715 --> 05:30.848
It's Penny's.

05:30.850 --> 05:32.649
Hey, you broke up with me.

05:32.651 --> 05:34.284
It is none of your business

05:34.286 --> 05:37.354
whose naked bosom I'm smooshing
around like pizza dough.

05:37.356 --> 05:38.789
Good-bye.

05:43.028 --> 05:44.127
Amy.

05:44.129 --> 05:45.562
Amy. Amy.

05:45.564 --> 05:48.265
(sighs)

05:48.267 --> 05:50.367
Hmm. Tables work, too.

05:50.369 --> 05:52.169
Good to know.

05:54.306 --> 05:57.507
Ooh, brownies
for girls' night!

05:57.509 --> 05:59.009
Hands off. I'm mad at you.

05:59.011 --> 06:00.110
(sighs)

06:00.112 --> 06:01.879
Look, I know it's
a lot of money,

06:01.881 --> 06:03.614
but the guy at
the store said

06:03.616 --> 06:06.650
in five to seven years,
it'll pay for itself.

06:06.652 --> 06:08.886
What will pay for itself?

06:13.959 --> 06:16.193
Doesn't matter.
What are you mad about?

06:17.029 --> 06:19.496
I'm mad at you
for blabbing to me

06:19.498 --> 06:21.231
what Leonard did
on the North Sea,

06:21.233 --> 06:22.699
and I'm mad that
I've had to hide this

06:22.701 --> 06:24.034
from Penny for two years.

06:24.036 --> 06:26.937
And you have every right to
be mad about those things.

06:26.939 --> 06:28.939
So, why don't you let me

06:28.941 --> 06:31.475
handle the credit card
bill this month, huh?

06:31.477 --> 06:33.377
I mean, don't
even look at it.

06:34.647 --> 06:36.847
I mean, if Penny finds out
I've known all this time

06:36.849 --> 06:38.048
and haven't told her,

06:38.050 --> 06:40.017
she's gonna think
I'm a terrible friend.

06:40.019 --> 06:41.551
I wish you never told me.

06:41.553 --> 06:43.954
And I wish Leonard
never told me.

06:43.956 --> 06:46.256
He's the bad guy here.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.493
I guess that's true.

06:49.495 --> 06:51.428
And you let
Penny marry him.

06:51.430 --> 06:53.597
(scoffs)

06:53.599 --> 06:56.133
Compared to that,
who cares if I bought

06:56.135 --> 06:58.902
a George Clooney limited
edition manscaping kit?

07:03.509 --> 07:06.376
Hi. I'm calling about your
marriage counseling services

07:06.378 --> 07:09.680
and was curious
what your rate is.

07:11.116 --> 07:13.417
Really?

07:13.419 --> 07:15.085
Um, okay.

07:15.087 --> 07:18.322
Is there any kind of discount
for length of marriage?

07:20.326 --> 07:22.492
'Cause we're just
talking hours here.

07:25.531 --> 07:27.364
Hi.
Call you back.

07:27.366 --> 07:28.398
Hey.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.933
Can we talk?

07:29.935 --> 07:31.268
I would love that.

07:35.574 --> 07:36.873
All right, look,

07:36.875 --> 07:38.942
I'm sorry I said I was
okay with everything

07:38.944 --> 07:40.077
before we got married.

07:40.079 --> 07:41.511
I hate that we're
going through this,

07:41.513 --> 07:42.946
but I don't know
what to do.

07:42.948 --> 07:45.282
If you don't mind
waiting for a Groupon,

07:45.284 --> 07:47.551
we can try marriage counseling.

07:48.988 --> 07:50.087
Hello.

07:50.089 --> 07:51.188
Hey, uh, buddy,

07:51.190 --> 07:52.456
can we have some privacy?

07:52.458 --> 07:53.790
Oh, of course.

07:53.792 --> 07:56.093
Wouldn't want to intrude.

07:56.095 --> 07:58.428
This is yours.

08:04.470 --> 08:06.103
Okay, when I'm
done with him,

08:06.105 --> 08:08.138
I'm gonna need
more information.

08:08.140 --> 08:09.306
Nothing odd.

08:09.308 --> 08:11.475
I just wanted
to rub Amy's nose in it.

08:12.745 --> 08:14.644
Okay, look, I might
be overreacting,

08:14.646 --> 08:16.747
but how am I supposed
to get past this

08:16.749 --> 08:18.715
when I know tomorrow
you're gonna go to work

08:18.717 --> 08:20.283
and see this woman?

08:20.285 --> 08:21.618
Forgive me for eavesdropping,

08:21.620 --> 08:25.255
but as I see it,
there's a simple solution.

08:25.257 --> 08:28.125
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

08:31.430 --> 08:33.964
Bring Penny to meet Mandy.

08:33.966 --> 08:35.799
What? Why?

08:35.801 --> 08:38.534
Well, right now, Penny's
imagination is running wild,

08:38.537 --> 08:40.404
but if they meet,
that will eliminate

08:40.405 --> 08:42.938
the mystery
and alleviate her fears.

08:42.941 --> 08:46.743
Like when that Sparkletts guy
let me look under his eye patch.

08:49.448 --> 08:53.150
Uh, first of all,
you made that guy cry.

08:53.152 --> 08:56.319
And we learned that you don't
need an eyeball to do that.

08:59.191 --> 09:01.958
Secondly, I can't think
of a more horrible idea

09:01.960 --> 09:03.527
than Penny meeting Mandy.

09:03.529 --> 09:05.595
Really? Why is that?

09:05.597 --> 09:06.863
What, you actually
want to meet her?

09:06.865 --> 09:08.231
No, but now that you're
being weird about it,

09:08.233 --> 09:09.299
maybe I should.

09:09.301 --> 09:10.333
I'm not being weird.

09:10.335 --> 09:11.368
Am I being weird?

09:11.370 --> 09:14.037
Yes.

09:14.039 --> 09:16.706
And that's coming from me.

09:17.576 --> 09:19.309
Fine, you want to meet her?

09:19.311 --> 09:21.111
No, I just want to know
that when you're at work,

09:21.113 --> 09:22.546
there's nothing going on.

09:22.548 --> 09:23.914
How many times
do I have to tell you?

09:23.916 --> 09:25.482
I have no interest
in this woman.

09:25.484 --> 09:26.917
Yeah, well, maybe she
has interest in you.

09:26.919 --> 09:28.385
In Leonard?

09:28.387 --> 09:30.821
Oh, even the Sparkletts guy
could see that's unlikely.

09:39.916 --> 09:42.950
I guess my big problem is
I never saw Leonard

09:42.952 --> 09:45.986
as the kind of guy who would
do something like this.

09:45.988 --> 09:48.656
Anybody can make a mistake
in a weak moment.

09:48.658 --> 09:50.725
(sighs)
What do you think?

09:51.594 --> 09:53.427
Oh, I don't know what to think.

09:53.429 --> 09:56.564
But then again,
I just found out about it.

09:58.368 --> 10:00.501
You know, I fell in love
with Leonard

10:00.503 --> 10:02.103
because he wasn't
anything like the guys

10:02.105 --> 10:03.437
I was used to dating.

10:03.439 --> 10:05.272
I mean, I knew those guys
weren't above cheating

10:05.274 --> 10:08.342
because that's usually
how we met.

10:08.344 --> 10:10.678
Come on, you know
Leonard's not like that.

10:10.680 --> 10:12.913
I want to believe you.
I really do.

10:12.915 --> 10:15.282
Am I being naive?

10:15.284 --> 10:16.951
Oh, I don't know.

10:16.953 --> 10:18.886
This is all so new to me.

10:18.888 --> 10:21.822
I'm still processing.

10:21.824 --> 10:24.759
You know, he never would've
done this when we first met.

10:24.761 --> 10:26.026
He's cockier now.

10:26.028 --> 10:28.062
That's because you made him
more confident.

10:28.064 --> 10:30.698
You know, if you think about it,
without you,

10:30.700 --> 10:33.000
he never would've grown
into the person he is now.

10:33.002 --> 10:35.803
I mean, sure,
more women might notice him,

10:35.805 --> 10:37.872
but I think it's better
to have a guy be with you

10:37.874 --> 10:39.340
because he wants to be

10:39.342 --> 10:41.609
and not because he thinks he
doesn't have any other choice.

10:41.611 --> 10:43.978
I never thought
about it like that.

10:43.980 --> 10:46.647
Oh, me neither,
not until just now.

10:48.885 --> 10:51.585
Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

10:51.587 --> 10:54.555
and welcome to "Sheldon Cooper
Presents: Fun With Flags."

10:54.557 --> 10:57.491
You may notice that
I'm holding a remote control.

10:57.493 --> 11:00.027
That's because my cameraperson
and co-host,

11:00.029 --> 11:01.562
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler,

11:01.564 --> 11:04.698
has chosen to end
her relationship with me.

11:06.502 --> 11:09.403
I'm going to pause here
to let that sink in.

11:16.512 --> 11:18.078
Okay.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.647
If you need to pause
a little longer,

11:19.649 --> 11:21.982
just click the pause button.

11:21.984 --> 11:24.018
But the show must go on.

11:24.020 --> 11:26.687
And thankfully, all the things
my girlfriend used to do

11:26.689 --> 11:29.290
can be taken care of
with my right hand.

11:36.632 --> 11:39.767
Anyway, let's not spend
any more time talking about her.

11:39.769 --> 11:41.035
We're here to talk about flags.

11:41.037 --> 11:42.203
Tonight's theme:

11:42.205 --> 11:44.205
flags of countries
that have been torn apart

11:44.207 --> 11:46.907
and the women I have a feeling
were responsible.

11:50.012 --> 11:52.179
You guys have any idea
how much it costs

11:52.181 --> 11:53.614
to see a marriage
counselor?

11:53.616 --> 11:55.115
$250 an hour. Why?

11:55.117 --> 11:57.651
How do you know?

11:57.653 --> 12:00.054
Bernadette and I have
occasionally gone to one to,

12:00.056 --> 12:01.956
you know, stay on top of things.

12:01.958 --> 12:05.459
And I'm just
hearing about this now?

12:05.461 --> 12:07.328
Dude, just because
we're best friends

12:07.330 --> 12:10.030
doesn't mean that I have to tell
you everything that goes on.

12:10.032 --> 12:12.766
You don't have to,
you should want to.

12:13.870 --> 12:16.103
Oh, great,
there's Mandy.

12:17.540 --> 12:20.541
Why are marine biologists
always so cute?

12:20.543 --> 12:22.510
I don't know,

12:22.512 --> 12:25.713
but I'd like to get lost
in her Bermuda Triangle.

12:26.449 --> 12:27.748
That's not helpful.

12:27.750 --> 12:29.416
Then I won't say

12:29.418 --> 12:32.586
I'd like to cover three-quarters
of her surface area.

12:32.588 --> 12:33.988
Are we done?

12:33.990 --> 12:35.656
Not yet, this is fun.

12:35.658 --> 12:37.424
Ooh, I know.

12:37.426 --> 12:39.860
I'd let her free my willy.

12:39.862 --> 12:41.362
Where you going?

12:41.364 --> 12:43.631
I'm gonna ask her if she'd
be willing to talk to Penny,

12:43.633 --> 12:45.032
tell her she has nothing
to worry about.

12:45.034 --> 12:46.467
Leonard, wait.
What?

12:46.469 --> 12:48.636
I'd like to SpongeBob
her SquarePants.

12:49.338 --> 12:52.072
Now we are done. (chuckles)

12:53.409 --> 12:55.142
Hey.

12:55.144 --> 12:56.176
Oh, hi, Leonard. What's up?

12:56.178 --> 12:58.145
Uh, do you mind
if I sit?

12:58.147 --> 12:59.647
Sure.

12:59.649 --> 13:01.782
So, um, I've been
thinking a lot

13:01.784 --> 13:04.585
about you and me and...
the boat.

13:04.587 --> 13:05.419
What about it?

13:05.421 --> 13:06.654
You know...

13:06.656 --> 13:08.622
what we did,
when we were drunk.

13:08.624 --> 13:12.259
Oh, no,
did I sleep with you, too?

13:12.261 --> 13:14.595
No, we just made out.

13:14.597 --> 13:16.597
Oh. Well, good for me.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.567
So what can I do for you?

13:19.569 --> 13:23.003
Uh, okay, well, um,
I got married recently.

13:23.005 --> 13:24.371
Oh, congratulations!

13:24.373 --> 13:26.874
To Sheldon?

13:26.876 --> 13:28.275
(chuckles)

13:28.277 --> 13:29.877
Never gets old.

13:29.879 --> 13:32.580
No, no, to a girl.

13:32.582 --> 13:34.949
Anyway, I told her what happened
between you and me,

13:34.951 --> 13:37.685
and she's concerned about us
seeing each other at work.

13:37.687 --> 13:40.187
It was just a kiss.
Why would you even tell her?

13:40.189 --> 13:43.023
Because I didn't want there
to be any secrets between us.

13:43.025 --> 13:44.491
Is that really the reason?

13:44.493 --> 13:46.660
What else would it be?

13:46.662 --> 13:48.062
I don't know.

13:48.064 --> 13:49.863
Sounds like you're trying
to sabotage the relationship.

13:49.865 --> 13:52.099
No, I don't think so.

13:52.101 --> 13:55.469
Although,
Penny did say exactly that.

13:55.471 --> 13:58.072
Okay, well, that's something
to think about.

13:58.074 --> 14:01.108
You know, on some level,
I've always believed

14:01.110 --> 14:03.143
that I don't deserve
a woman like her.

14:03.145 --> 14:06.080
Oh, you're gonna
think about that right here?

14:07.984 --> 14:10.084
I mean, she's really beautiful.

14:10.086 --> 14:12.086
She could have
any guy she wants.

14:12.088 --> 14:13.721
Which is probably why

14:13.723 --> 14:16.490
it took her so many years
to tell me she loved me.

14:16.492 --> 14:18.993
Maybe you should talk
to a therapist about this.

14:18.995 --> 14:21.328
Too expensive.

14:23.165 --> 14:26.266
You'd think I'd be used to women
withholding their love.

14:26.268 --> 14:27.601
I mean, my mother did.

14:27.603 --> 14:29.403
I mean, no matter
how hard I tried,

14:29.405 --> 14:31.505
she just didn't have
any interest in me.

14:31.507 --> 14:34.074
Imagine that.

14:34.076 --> 14:35.809
I wonder if that's why I have

14:35.811 --> 14:38.178
such a dysfunctional
relationship with Sheldon.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.580
I had a dream

14:39.582 --> 14:42.282
the other night that
I was in a cave

14:42.284 --> 14:45.285
and I was nursing a baby,

14:45.287 --> 14:49.356
but the baby
had Sheldon's head on it.

14:51.227 --> 14:54.261
And your wife is worried
about me?

14:54.997 --> 14:56.263
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Hey, Leonard!

14:56.265 --> 14:57.431
When you're done,

14:57.433 --> 15:00.200
we came up with
a bunch more.

15:03.406 --> 15:05.806
Then the Czech Republic
says to Slovakia,

15:05.808 --> 15:08.409
"I don't think you understand
how being broken up works!"

15:08.411 --> 15:10.411
Can you believe that?

15:10.413 --> 15:12.079
You'd think
that the Czech Republic

15:12.081 --> 15:13.614
would try to hold on
to what it had,

15:13.616 --> 15:15.582
given that it's not as young
as it used to be.

15:15.584 --> 15:17.551
And I don't see
any other countries

15:17.553 --> 15:20.654
lining up to invade
its southern borders.

15:20.656 --> 15:22.823
I'm gonna kill him.

15:23.926 --> 15:25.492
But enough
about the Czech Republic.

15:25.494 --> 15:28.162
Let's talk about the time
Moldova made Romania

15:28.164 --> 15:31.031
a birthday cake
and Romania said it tasted good

15:31.033 --> 15:32.299
even though it didn't.

15:32.301 --> 15:34.068
And yet Romania gets dumped.

15:34.070 --> 15:36.670
I'll pause here
while you mull that one over.

15:38.474 --> 15:40.674
I know, right?

15:44.346 --> 15:47.548
So, you said you had
something to tell me.

15:47.550 --> 15:48.916
Okay, yeah, um,

15:48.918 --> 15:50.684
do you remember
when you accused me

15:50.686 --> 15:52.553
of trying to sabotage
our wedding?

15:52.555 --> 15:54.588
Uh-huh.

15:54.590 --> 15:57.524
I've been thinking about it,
and you might be right.

15:59.061 --> 16:03.030
But the good news is
that I'm pretty sure I know why.

16:03.032 --> 16:04.932
I'm listening.

16:05.735 --> 16:07.534
Penny, after all these years,

16:07.536 --> 16:10.304
I still feel like
maybe I don't deserve you.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.073
Okay, that is the lamest excuse

16:13.075 --> 16:15.609
you could've possibly
come up with.

16:16.979 --> 16:18.312
But I get it.

16:18.314 --> 16:19.480
You do?

16:19.482 --> 16:20.948
Yeah.

16:20.950 --> 16:22.349
Sometimes I worry
you're gonna wake up

16:22.351 --> 16:24.618
and leave me
for someone more like you.

16:25.921 --> 16:28.789
I don't even understand
why you're with someone like me.

16:28.791 --> 16:31.792
Why would I want to be
with someone like me?

16:31.794 --> 16:33.393
You know what I mean.

16:33.395 --> 16:35.796
And, you know, maybe the way
I've been reacting

16:35.798 --> 16:39.500
was me sabotaging this, too.

16:39.502 --> 16:42.503
(sighs)
Well, how about we stop

16:42.505 --> 16:45.305
being so scared
of losing each other

16:45.307 --> 16:46.840
and just be together?

16:46.842 --> 16:49.576
That sounds nice.

16:49.578 --> 16:50.577
Good.

16:50.579 --> 16:51.945
(both chuckle)

16:51.947 --> 16:53.514
Because...

16:53.516 --> 16:55.716
I've loved you
since the moment we met,

16:55.718 --> 16:58.886
and I will keep loving you
until the end of time.

16:58.888 --> 17:00.287
Oh.

17:00.289 --> 17:02.289
Oh, my God,
that is the most beautiful thing

17:02.291 --> 17:04.657
anyone's ever said to me.
Yeah?

17:04.660 --> 17:07.795
That's because you're beautiful,

17:07.797 --> 17:12.499
and your beauty fills my heart
with love and song.

17:14.336 --> 17:16.637
It's getting
kind of cheesy, Leonard.

17:16.638 --> 17:17.738
Huh?

17:17.740 --> 17:20.540
If you think that's
cheesy, buckle up.

17:22.578 --> 17:24.444
Penny Hofstadter,

17:24.445 --> 17:26.713
will you please
stay married to me?

17:27.817 --> 17:29.716
Oh, damn it, you topped it.

17:33.122 --> 17:35.556
Should we go to the bedroom
and make this marriage official?

17:35.558 --> 17:37.424
Yes, please!
Okay!

17:46.587 --> 17:49.370
Sheldon, I can't believe
you got us a wedding gift.

17:49.470 --> 17:51.236
I don't know
why you're so surprised.

17:51.238 --> 17:54.573
I watch movies;
I see what people do.

17:54.575 --> 17:56.375
What is this?

17:56.377 --> 17:58.377
Plane tickets
and hotel reservations

17:58.379 --> 18:00.412
for a weekend away
in San Francisco.

18:00.414 --> 18:01.713
Oh!
Wow!

18:01.715 --> 18:03.382
That's so great!

18:03.384 --> 18:06.485
Yeah, there's Fisherman's Wharf
and Alcatraz and cable cars.

18:06.487 --> 18:08.020
We're gonna have so much fun.

18:08.022 --> 18:09.187
(knocking on door)

18:12.225 --> 18:13.692
We?

18:13.694 --> 18:14.760
Is there a problem?

18:14.762 --> 18:17.295
Oh, no, no!
I just, I said, "Whee!"

18:18.731 --> 18:22.534
How dare you go on the Internet
and say mean things about me

18:22.536 --> 18:26.104
and compare my genitalia
to part of Czechoslovakia?!

18:27.106 --> 18:29.408
You saw through that one,
did you?

18:29.410 --> 18:30.976
I don't know
what you were thinking,

18:30.978 --> 18:34.112
but take the video down now!

18:35.882 --> 18:37.115
She watched it.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.784
I'm gonna get that girl back.

18:38.786 --> 18:42.154
AMY: I only watched it
because you e-mailed it to me

18:42.156 --> 18:44.322
with the subject line:
"This is gonna make you mad"!

18:47.220 --> 18:49.140
She was listening through
the door. She wants me.
