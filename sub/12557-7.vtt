INTO THE OLD JAIL.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.678
WELL, THEY DID IT.
THEY SHOT HIM DOWN.

01:41.768 --> 01:45.853
I NEVER THOUGHT THEY'D DO THAT. NOT
TO PINTO SYKES. NOT THAT EASY.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.931
HE AIN'T GOT MORE THAN A FEVV
MINUTES LEFT TO Ll\/E, JOHNNY ROB.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.687
YOU GO FETCH
HIS PAW AND SISTER.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.643
ALL RIGHT, MOTHERSHED.

01:55.073 --> 01:58.611
YES, SIR. THAT'S

02:04.291 --> 02:06.828
NORMALLY, THE OLD MAN
WOULD BE CORRECT.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.875
THIS WOULD BE THE
END OF THE STORY.

02:08.961 --> 02:11.499
WE'VE HAD THE TRADITIONAL
SHOOTOUT ON THE STREET,

AND THE BADMAN VVILL SOON BE DEAD.
BUT SOME MEN OF LEGEND AND FOLKTALE

HAVE BEEN KNOVVN TO CONTINUE HAVING
THEIR VVAY E\/EN AFTER DEATH.

HOW HE INTRODUCES THE TOWN

03:14.695 --> 03:17.608
WHY'D THEY FENCE OFF THAT

03:17.698 --> 03:22.693
IT'S HIS BLOOD. IF YOU COULD
SEE DOVVN UNDER ALL THAT DUST,

03:22.744 --> 03:24.781
YOU COULD SEE
HIS BLOOD DOWN THERE.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.248
WHOSE BLOOD?

FOUR MONTHS OF THE YEAR
WASTED LOOKING FOR HIM,

AND I COULD HAVE
FOUND HIM HERE.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.821
<i>[strums guitar]</i>

05:24.866 --> 05:27.198
THAT AIN'T THE WAY

05:27.285 --> 05:29.993
HE CLAIMED YOU DIDN'T E\/EN
TRY TO CATCH UP TO HIM.

05:31.957 --> 05:34.494
HELLO, JOHNNY ROB.

05:34.584 --> 05:38.418
STILL AS BIG A BLABBERMOUTH

05:41.967 --> 05:44.254
BUT NO NEED TO GET
RILED, CONNY.

05:44.344 --> 05:48.008
US HERE AIN'T SAYING THAT YOU
DIDN'T ACTUALLY TRY TO CATCH HIM,

05:48.056 --> 05:51.640
BUT IT IS A FACT THAT PINTO
CLAIMED THAT ON HIS DEATHBED.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.435
HE TALKED
BEFORE HE DIED?

05:55.522 --> 05:58.105
MM-HM. HE LIVED A HALF
HOUR AFTER HE VVAS SHOT.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.649
TALKED A BLUE STREAK
RIGHT UP TO THE VERY END.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.686
WHAT DID HE
SAY ABOUT ME?

06:03.780 --> 06:08.650
I RECKON THAT, UH, CONNY
DESERVES TO HEAR IT ALL.

VVE TOLD HIM HOVV ONE PINTO SYKES IS
VVANTED BY THE LAVV IN THREE STATES,

BUT HOVV HE TREATS THIS TOVVN LIKE
IT VVAS HIS PERSONAL PROPERTY

06:27.178 --> 06:30.546
JUST 'CAUSE HE WAS
BORN AND RAISED HERE.

06:30.599 --> 06:33.887

TELLS US TO GROW UP
AND ACT LIKE MEN,

06:52.579 --> 06:56.322
OR ELSE LEA\/E TOVVN AND MOVE

WE ALL JOIN IN,
AND WE TAKE HIM.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.768

HE RODE IN.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.762
NOW, DO YOU WANT
TO TELL IT, IRA?

07:16.853 --> 07:19.185
THAT'S ABOUT ALL
THERE IS TO TELL.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.264

OUT IN THE STREET.
THAT'S ALL THERE IS.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.686
NO, NO. THAT IS

HE TOLD HIS PAW
HOW SORRY HE WAS

07:49.260 --> 07:51.968

<i>HOW HE WISHED SHE'D MARRYA

BURIED NEAR HIS MAVV,

08:11.241 --> 08:15.326
ONLY 2O FEET AVVAY, AS SHE'S TOO TRUE A
VVOMAN TO HA\/E THE LIKES OF HIM ANY CLOSER.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.826
WHAT DID HE
SAY ABOUT ME?

08:19.874 --> 08:23.037

22:05.825 --> 22:08.863
THE VVHOLE STORY IS RIGHT THERE.
LOOK AT HIM.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.660
HE CAME UP HERE. HE HAD MORE
COURAGE THAN I THOUGHT.

22:17.711 --> 22:21.170
THERE'S HIS KNEE PRINTS.
HE KNELT BY THE GRAVE.

22:22.633 --> 22:24.590
HE PULLED HIS KNIFE
FROM HIS BELT

22:24.677 --> 22:27.339
AND PLUNGED IT
INTO THE GRAVE.

22:27.429 --> 22:31.172
BUT THE VVIND VVAS STRONG, AND IT
BLEVV HIS COATTAIL OVER THE GRAVE.

22:31.267 --> 22:34.931
<i>BEING DARK, HE DIDN'T NOTICE HE'D PUT
HIS KNIFE THROUGH HIS OWN COATTAIL,</i>

22:37.731 --> 22:40.223

HIS COATTAIL.

22:45.698 --> 22:48.030

22:48.117 --> 22:52.031
PINTO REACHED OUT
AND GRABBED HIM.

22:52.079 --> 22:55.037
HE VVAS ALREADY SCARED HALF TO
DEATH, AND THAT FINISHED HIM.

THERE YOU ARE, BUD.

23:10.389 --> 23:13.256

DEATH WAS AN ACCIDENT?

23:13.350 --> 23:16.217

IN HIS OWN COATTAIL?</i>

23:16.312 --> 23:18.644
YES, MA'AM.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.972
HOW DID HIS COATTAIL
GET OVER THE GRAVE?

23:21.066 --> 23:24.149
FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER
HE HAD IT UNBUTTONED.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.898
THE WIND MUST HAVE
DONE THE REST.
