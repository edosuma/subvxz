00:03.045 --> 00:04.964
<i>Living in a small Texas town,</i>

00:05.047 --> 00:06.799
<i>a few things are guaranteed:</i>

00:07.466 --> 00:09.760
<i>Someone nearby
will have chickens...</i>

00:09.844 --> 00:11.095
- George...
- Yeah?

00:11.178 --> 00:12.513
Go shoot those chickens.

00:12.805 --> 00:15.057
<i>...everyone will know
your business...</i>

00:15.224 --> 00:16.809
You sure you want
to eat that?

00:17.476 --> 00:18.561
Why not?

00:18.894 --> 00:21.605
I heard your triglycerides
are through the roof.

00:21.814 --> 00:22.940
Who told you that?

00:23.024 --> 00:24.775
My brother plays poker
with your doctor.

00:28.821 --> 00:32.198
<i>...but on the brighter side,
in a small Texas town,</i>

00:32.533 --> 00:34.368
<i>people take care of each other.</i>

00:34.452 --> 00:36.954
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:39.832 --> 00:41.625
You know that
Veronica Duncan girl?

00:42.084 --> 00:44.128
- The one that Georgie likes?
- Yeah.

00:44.670 --> 00:47.381
I was thinking about having her
stay here for a couple days.

00:48.007 --> 00:49.550
Was it Georgie's birthday
or something?

00:49.800 --> 00:50.800
No.

00:51.093 --> 00:53.888
She's just having a rough time
at home.

00:54.263 --> 00:55.347
What's going on?

00:55.639 --> 00:58.059
Her mother's boyfriend
has a drinking problem,

00:58.142 --> 01:01.312
and... things have been
getting out of hand.

01:01.729 --> 01:02.998
You waited till I had a beer
to tell me

01:03.022 --> 01:05.524
- this story, didn't you?
- You always have a beer.

01:08.444 --> 01:09.612
So, good news.

01:09.779 --> 01:11.989
We're gonna have a houseguest
for a couple days.

01:12.073 --> 01:13.240
Oh, not Aunt Ruth.

01:13.449 --> 01:14.909
Her beard is very scratchy.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.619
My sister doesn't have a beard.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.746
- Did she shave it?
- It's not Aunt Ruth!

01:19.580 --> 01:20.790
It's Veronica Duncan.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.417
<i>And while she's here,</i>

01:23.501 --> 01:26.712
I expect y'all to be
on your best behavior.

01:27.338 --> 01:28.378
Why are you looking at me?

01:28.798 --> 01:29.798
Was I?

01:30.216 --> 01:31.258
Yeah, and you still are.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.803
Where is she going to sleep?

01:33.886 --> 01:35.721
She can have my room.
I'm fine on the couch.

01:35.971 --> 01:36.846
Thank you.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.140
Why is she staying with us?

01:38.933 --> 01:42.311
Because she needs to be out
of her house for a few days.

01:42.561 --> 01:44.563
- Why?
- Because her family

01:44.647 --> 01:46.774
is dealing with
some personal business.

01:47.108 --> 01:48.359
What personal business?

01:48.943 --> 01:49.484
Well...

01:49.485 --> 01:51.612
I heard her mama's
boyfriend is a drunk.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.154
Where did you hear that?

01:53.322 --> 01:54.990
Mom told you outside
and I heard it.

Did you know that word "hello"
wasn't used as a greeting

02:37.741 --> 02:40.035
until the invention
of the telephone?

02:40.119 --> 02:42.371
- Hi, John.
- To end a phone call,

02:42.454 --> 02:45.875
it was suggested to say,
"That is all."

02:46.667 --> 02:48.252
Is that all, John?

02:48.335 --> 02:51.005

02:56.927 --> 03:00.139

Oh, we're going to Puerta Roja.

John, you do realize that I'll
be the one driving us there.

03:08.856 --> 03:14.361
Fine, we're going to Puerta Roja,

senses of a polar bear.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.987
They can smell a seal
through three feet of ice.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.405
Mind your business.

He's exhibiting Zahavian

Hey there.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.472
Thank you for having me,
Mrs. Cooper.

05:05.556 --> 05:06.974
Hey, Veronica.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.726
- Hi.
- Let me take your bag.

05:09.143 --> 05:10.912
- Are you wearing Old Spice?
- Don't worry about it.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.062
Here, let me
show you around.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.440
Oh. O-Okay.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.066
Of course you remember
the living room,

05:16.150 --> 05:17.735
where we have
our prayer group.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.862
Oh, my Lord...

05:20.946 --> 05:24.199
And this is the dining room.
That's where we'll dine.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.702
But in the mornings,
we dine in the kitchen.

05:27.036 --> 05:28.263
Of course,
if you'd like a snack,

05:28.287 --> 05:30.581
that'd be in the
refrigerator or the pantry.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.042
- You know, where your snack foods would be.
- Sure.

05:33.542 --> 05:34.668
Washer, dryer.

05:34.752 --> 05:37.087
Plus, we got those
little sheets that smell nice

05:37.171 --> 05:38.922
and fight
static cling.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.595
- And here's our entertainment room.
- Hey, guys.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.679
- Hi.
- Hello.

05:45.763 --> 05:47.264
We don't have cable,
but we do have

05:47.598 --> 05:50.726
all three major
broadcast networks.

05:57.232 --> 06:00.694
Here's the bathroom,
for hygiene and whatnot.

06:01.195 --> 06:04.198
And... here's where
you'll be sleeping.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.034
Did I take your room?

06:07.368 --> 06:09.078
Yes, but I'll be on the couch,

06:09.161 --> 06:10.805
which is right near
the TV and the kitchen,

06:10.829 --> 06:11.997
so I'm peachy.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.004
Hello. I'm John Sturgis.

06:19.088 --> 06:20.339
We have a reservation.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.174
Follow me.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.926
♪♪♪♪

06:25.803 --> 06:28.138
Was a reservation
really necessary?

06:28.222 --> 06:30.808
I didn't want to take
any chances.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.309
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

06:32.393 --> 06:33.811
I sit in that seat.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.646
You sit here.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.314
Oh, uh, okay.

06:41.777 --> 06:42.778
What's going on?

06:43.237 --> 06:44.237
Don't you remember?

06:44.238 --> 06:46.156
John, I don't even remember
where I just parked.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.201
I'm recreating our first date!

06:49.701 --> 06:52.329
The same restaurant,
the same table,

06:52.413 --> 06:53.664
the same jacket.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.457
Different eyelashes,
though, because

06:55.541 --> 06:57.668
they regenerate
every two to three months.

06:57.751 --> 06:58.831
Mine are the
same, actually.

06:58.877 --> 06:59.878
They're fake.

07:03.132 --> 07:05.759
I wanted this night
to be special

07:05.843 --> 07:10.097
because it's the one year
anniversary of that date.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.516
Is that a thing that people
our age celebrate?

07:12.599 --> 07:15.269
No idea.
I've never been this age before.

07:15.352 --> 07:18.147
And I've never dated anyone
for a whole year.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.357
Well...

07:20.899 --> 07:22.860
Happy anniversary.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.662
Sorry for the mess.

07:34.746 --> 07:37.291
I emptied out this drawer
so you can put your stuff away.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.293
Where are
your clothes?

07:39.376 --> 07:40.544
I threw most of them out.

07:40.627 --> 07:41.920
You didn't have
to do that.

07:42.004 --> 07:44.381
It's okay.
They were old and full of holes.

07:44.465 --> 07:45.507
And it worked out great.

07:45.591 --> 07:48.260
I found some firecrackers
and a bag full of my baby teeth.

07:49.011 --> 07:50.012
Thank you.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.931
Oh. I also hung a cross
over the bed for you.

07:53.015 --> 07:55.243
It's just Popsicle sticks
and glitter. I glued it together

07:55.267 --> 07:56.894
in Sunday school
when I was a kid.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.647
Is... is it too much?
I can take it down.

08:01.732 --> 08:03.567
No, it's...

08:03.650 --> 08:05.986
it's really sweet.

08:07.863 --> 08:11.074
Why are you crying?

08:11.158 --> 08:13.577
Did Georgie bring up
your unfortunate home life?

08:14.286 --> 08:15.329
Uh, no.

08:15.787 --> 08:16.955
Good. My mom said not to,

08:17.039 --> 08:18.624
so that you
would be comfortable.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.959
Thank you.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.629
Are you comfortable?

08:25.589 --> 08:28.717
And I remember
how cute you looked

08:28.800 --> 08:31.512
in your little pearl snap
shirt with your bolo tie.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.890
Well, I'd say it wasn't
my first rodeo, but it was.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.979
Thank you for
a wonderful year.

08:41.063 --> 08:44.232
- To many more.
- To many more.

08:47.236 --> 08:51.073
Which leads me
to the final surprise

08:51.156 --> 08:52.282
of the evening.

08:54.284 --> 08:57.955
- What are you doing?
- Hang on, I don't want to spoil the surprise.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.374
Getting down on one knee,
it makes it pretty damn clear.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.918
Surprise!

09:10.717 --> 09:13.345
Connie, will you
do me the honor

09:13.428 --> 09:15.138
of being my wife?

09:16.390 --> 09:18.433
Oh, John, I don't know.

09:19.601 --> 09:22.062
How can you not know?
It's a binary decision.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.565
It's more complicated
th-than that.

09:24.648 --> 09:26.692
I don't see why.
We're compatible.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.152
- I know.
- We enjoy each other's company.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.823
- I know.
- And we've become extremely proficient in the bedroom.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.700
There's very little
wasted effort.

09:34.783 --> 09:35.993
John, sit back down

09:36.076 --> 09:37.411
and lower your voice.

09:38.662 --> 09:39.746
Little help?

09:39.830 --> 09:42.708
- Down is easier than up.
- Sure.

09:44.835 --> 09:47.129
Thank you, God,
for this food we're about to receive,

09:47.212 --> 09:49.339
and for the nourishment
of our bodies, and bless

09:49.423 --> 09:51.008
the hands that prepared it.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.677
And an extra special thank you
for allowing us

09:53.760 --> 09:56.805
to share our home
with our friend Veronica.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.515
- Amen.
- Oh, yeah.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.434
That's a big amen on that one.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.185
All right, everybody, dig in.

10:02.728 --> 10:04.146
Would you like a dinner roll?

10:04.229 --> 10:05.355
Mmm. Sure.

10:06.064 --> 10:08.317
I find it really
rounds out the meal.

10:09.568 --> 10:10.944
- Mom?
- Yes, honey?

10:11.028 --> 10:13.488
Do I have to sit downwind
of Georgie's cologne?

10:14.489 --> 10:17.200
So, Veronica, I understand
that you're a junior?

10:17.284 --> 10:18.452
Mm. Yes, sir.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.954
Do you have any plans
for after high school?

10:21.038 --> 10:23.332
I'm hoping for a
scholarship to Baylor

10:23.415 --> 10:25.375
- so I can get a teaching degree.
- Mm.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.127
I like kids.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.630
Really? Kids? Ugh.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.799
You're so tall and pretty.
You should be Vanna White.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.259
How can she be Vanna White?

10:34.343 --> 10:35.761
Vanna White is Vanna White.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.846
Fine. She can be Vanna Blue.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.640
See? This is the kind
of nonsense you have

10:39.723 --> 10:41.475
to deal with
when you're around kids.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.018
He does have a point.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.771
No. I-I love this.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.856
We never eat dinner
together at my house.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.316
You eat alone?

10:50.984 --> 10:52.653
Mostly. Yeah.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.072
Lucky duck.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.118
John...

11:00.202 --> 11:01.703
I've already been
married once.

11:01.787 --> 11:04.539
I wasn't really planning
on ever doing it again.

11:04.623 --> 11:05.749
Why not?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.919
I was somebody's wife
for a long time.

11:09.878 --> 11:13.590
I just like being...
Connie Tucker now.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.425
Not Mrs...

11:15.509 --> 11:16.843
somebody else's name.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.262
Well, what if I took your name?

11:20.097 --> 11:22.307
John Tucker, it sounds great.

11:22.391 --> 11:25.519
Like a football player
or an astronaut.

11:25.602 --> 11:26.895
You're missing the point.

11:26.978 --> 11:29.272
I just think it's important
for people to know

11:29.356 --> 11:30.982
that we're an official couple.

11:31.066 --> 11:32.859
We don't have to be married
for that.

11:32.943 --> 11:35.696
Buy a billboard,
take an ad out in the paper.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.075
I understand. Thank you.

11:43.245 --> 11:44.246
Are we good?

11:44.830 --> 11:46.123
Yes.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.335
But if I should
pre-decease you...

11:52.629 --> 11:54.256
I want you to have the ring.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.425
- Fine.
- It'll be in the...

11:56.508 --> 11:59.928
top right corner
of my dresser drawer.

12:00.011 --> 12:02.764
Got it.
Under my tube socks.

12:10.147 --> 12:11.732
Veronica.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.024
Veronica.

12:13.108 --> 12:14.109
<i>Come in.</i>

12:15.819 --> 12:17.112
Hey, Sheldon, what's up?

12:17.195 --> 12:18.864
I printed out
my bathroom schedule.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.782
I can't speak for anyone else
in this family,

12:20.866 --> 12:22.534
but you can count on it
being occupied

12:22.617 --> 12:23.869
during these times.

12:24.995 --> 12:25.996
Thank you.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.748
This is very helpful.

12:27.831 --> 12:28.999
I know.

12:33.003 --> 12:34.337
Is there anything else?

12:34.421 --> 12:37.632
There is, but...
I'm not allowed to ask about it.

12:38.049 --> 12:39.926
Oh, it's okay.
You can ask me anything.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.928
Oh, good.
I don't like cats,

12:42.012 --> 12:43.764
but I share
their curious nature.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.766
What do you want to know?

12:46.266 --> 12:47.684
Your mom has a boyfriend.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.270
- Yeah.
- Where's your father?

12:51.354 --> 12:52.397
I don't know.

12:53.398 --> 12:54.524
Why do you not know?

12:54.608 --> 12:56.818
Well, he left
when I was really young

12:56.902 --> 12:58.528
and I never
heard from him again.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.363
And why are you staying here?

13:01.281 --> 13:03.283
My mom's boyfriend
isn't very nice.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.536
I understand.
My sister isn't very nice.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.580
So you get it?

13:08.663 --> 13:10.165
I do, thank you.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.667
Okay, well,
talk to you later.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.795
But not between
7:00 and 7:12.

13:14.878 --> 13:17.506
Yup, I see it right here.

13:27.349 --> 13:28.892
So... how about

13:28.975 --> 13:31.520
I make us a pot of tea
and we'll get cozy?

13:31.603 --> 13:33.104
Sure, sounds good.

13:33.188 --> 13:36.107
Just make yourself comfy,
I'll... I'll be right back.

13:39.945 --> 13:41.238
Mint tea?

13:41.321 --> 13:44.616
Or would you like to go crazy
and have a little hibiscus?

13:54.960 --> 13:56.670

15:02.527 --> 15:04.195
Yes, please.

15:05.322 --> 15:07.699
How was your anniversary date
with Dr. Sturgis?

15:07.782 --> 15:08.825
You knew about that?

15:08.909 --> 15:11.286
- Yes.
- So you knew he was gonna propose?

15:11.369 --> 15:13.538
Propose? No, that's wonderful.

15:13.622 --> 15:16.082
Although it's a little disconcerting
he didn't tell me.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.834
I thought we were
closer than that.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.260
Well, we're not
getting married any time soon.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.964
You should. You're old.
You don't have many years left.

15:23.632 --> 15:26.301
I really need to meet
a whole new group of people.

15:30.347 --> 15:31.890
Hey, what you doin'?

15:32.807 --> 15:34.643
Helping your mom with laundry.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.478
Oh, yeah. That's usually my job.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.861
Uh, maybe when you're done,
we can go down to the mall

15:44.945 --> 15:46.154
and hang out.

15:46.237 --> 15:49.741
Oh, I promised your sister I'd
take her out for some girl time.

15:49.824 --> 15:51.201
Maybe I can come along.

15:52.035 --> 15:54.079
Then it wouldn't be girl time.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.289
No, not entirely,
but it would be mostly.
