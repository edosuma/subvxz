WEBVTT

00:07.308 --> 00:09.640
FORGET WHAT WE SAW.
WE'RE HERE,

00:09.640 --> 00:13.614
AND I DON'T WANT
TO WASTE ANY MORE TIME.
I'VE BEEN KEEPING
A SECRET FROM YOU.

00:13.614 --> 00:18.789
KEIKO--SHE'S IN LOS ANGELES.
(woman) KEIKO ARAHIDA.
YOUR MOM HAS POSTED YOUR BAIL.

00:18.789 --> 00:21.021
THIS RING IS
A QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT DEVICE.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.794
THIS LITTLE THING PREVENTS
PEOPLE FROM BLACKING OUT?

00:23.794 --> 00:25.726
HELLINGER WANTS TO HELP YOU.
WHO'S HELLINGER?

00:25.726 --> 00:28.729
HELLINGER'S OUR BOSS.
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE,

00:28.729 --> 00:31.132
BUT YOUR DAUGHTER'S GONNA BE
BETTER OFF WHEN YOU'RE GONE.
(grunts)

00:31.132 --> 00:32.763
THEY HAD ME INSTALL
A PIECE OF SOFTWARE.

00:32.763 --> 00:35.406
I CAN FIND OUT WHO MADE IT
AND WHERE IT CAME FROM.

00:35.406 --> 00:38.539
YOU GET ME INTO N.L.A.P.
I'LL TELL YOU

00:38.539 --> 00:41.072
WHO CAUSED THE BLACKOUT.
JANIS, THIS GUY HAS BEEN
LYING TO US ABOUT EVERYTHING.

00:41.072 --> 00:44.245
AND NOW YOU WANT
TO TAKE HIM TO N.L.A.P.?

00:44.245 --> 00:47.448
HOW THE HELL
DO YOU TRUST THIS GUY?
HER HEART HAS STOPPED BEATING.
SHE'S GONE.

00:47.448 --> 00:48.779
NO, NO!

00:48.779 --> 00:51.122
YOU DO THE MATH. YOU'RE BOTH
PART OF THE EQUATION,

00:51.122 --> 00:53.754
BOTH OF YOU.
I CANNOT BE IN THAT HOUSE
WITH YOU TONIGHT.

00:53.754 --> 00:56.727
AT 10:00 P.M.,
YOU HAVE TO BE HERE WITH ME.

00:56.727 --> 00:59.460
(Mark) ON APRIL 29th,
I'M GONNA BE ON A BENDER.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.562
SO WHY NOT START NOW?

01:01.562 --> 01:03.794
TODAY'S THE DAY
DADDY'S GONNA DIE.

01:10.141 --> 01:13.774
(keys jangling,
cell door closes in distance)

01:13.774 --> 01:15.846
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

01:23.314 --> 01:26.317
(fireworks exploding
in distance)

01:28.319 --> 01:30.761
WHY ARE WE STOPPING,
MOM?

01:30.761 --> 01:34.094
'CAUSE WE'RE JUST GONNA
SIT HERE FOR A WHILE.

01:34.094 --> 01:38.569
OKAY. OH, WOW, LOOK!
THAT ONE'S SHAPED A STAR.
YEAH.

01:38.569 --> 01:40.801
OH, LOOK AT THAT, MOM.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.473
(Olivia) YEAH.

01:52.543 --> 01:54.685
(keys jangle)

02:03.394 --> 02:06.126
(man) FLIGHT NUMBER 37...

02:06.126 --> 02:09.129
(both speaking Japanese)

02:15.135 --> 02:17.608
I'M LOOKING FOR
A KEIKO ARAHIDA.

02:17.608 --> 02:19.810
I BELIEVE
SHE'S BEING HELD HERE.

02:19.810 --> 02:22.643
WAS. SHE WAS RELEASED
AN HOUR AGO.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.645
UM...

02:24.645 --> 02:26.917
DID--DID SHE SAY
WHERE SHE WAS GOING?

02:26.917 --> 02:29.280
NOT IN ENGLISH.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.522
WELL, DO YOU HAVE
A PHONE NUMBER FOR HER?

02:31.522 --> 02:34.525
UM, UH, THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME
SORT OF INTAKE FILE, RIGHT?

02:34.525 --> 02:36.687
YOU GOT A WARRANT, OFFICER?

02:46.437 --> 02:52.473
LISTEN, THIS KEIKO--
I'VE NEVER MET HER.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.675
BUT I SAW HER
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD.

02:54.675 --> 02:58.909
I-I STARTED DRAWING HER. I HAVE
20 CANVASES IN MY HOUSE OF HER.

02:58.909 --> 03:01.712
SHE WAS WEARING THIS T-SHIRT
OF A SUSHI RESTAURANT

03:01.712 --> 03:04.855
JUST OUTSIDE OF TOKYO.
SO I FLEW TO JAPAN.

03:04.855 --> 03:08.359
I FLEW TO JAPAN
BECAUSE OF A T-SHIRT.

03:08.359 --> 03:10.361
BUT I DIDN'T FIND HER.
I DIDN'T FIND HER,

03:10.361 --> 03:12.693
AND I THOUGHT
THAT WAS MY ONLY SHOT.

03:14.795 --> 03:17.768
I KNOW THAT
SHE'S HERE IN L.A.,

03:17.768 --> 03:22.673
AND NOW MAYBE
YOU HAVE A PHONE NUMBER.

03:22.673 --> 03:26.477
SHE CHANGED MY LIFE
JUST BECAUSE I SAW HER.

03:28.539 --> 03:31.542
THAT WAS REALLY
YOUR FLASH-FORWARD?

03:31.542 --> 03:33.884
YEAH. IT WAS.

03:33.884 --> 03:35.686
THAT'S AMAZING.

03:35.686 --> 03:39.550
(lowers voice)
BECAUSE IN MY FLASH-FORWARD...

03:39.550 --> 03:42.493
(whispering)
I HAD $100 IN MY POCKET,

03:42.493 --> 03:44.825
AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
FOR THE LIFE OF ME

03:44.825 --> 03:46.757
HOW IT GOT THERE.

03:54.365 --> 03:57.608
(Aaron) THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

03:57.608 --> 04:00.371
I SAW HER ALIVE.

04:00.371 --> 04:02.813
SO DID YOU.

04:06.617 --> 04:10.020
I SAW HER.

04:10.020 --> 04:11.922
OKAY.

04:25.936 --> 04:27.568
A PULSE?

04:27.568 --> 04:30.441
YES. VERY FAINT.

04:30.441 --> 04:32.643
STAY WITH ME, TRACE.
(sniffles)

04:32.643 --> 04:34.645
I'M BEGGING YOU.

04:34.645 --> 04:36.747
STAY STRONG.

04:36.747 --> 04:38.749
OKAY.
STAY WITH ME, TRACY.

04:38.749 --> 04:40.411
STAY WITH ME.

04:40.411 --> 04:45.486
JUST LIVE, AND WE'LL WIND UP
WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.604
THAT'S IT...

05:03.604 --> 05:06.877
THE LA HONDA ACCESS POINT.

05:06.877 --> 05:08.909
THIS IS MILE 6

05:08.909 --> 05:10.941
OF THE ACCELERATOR'S
10-MILE LENGTH.

05:10.941 --> 05:14.815
WE GET IN THERE,
I CAN GET TO THE MAINFRAME,

05:14.815 --> 05:17.087
FIND THE SOFTWARE
HELLINGER'S MEN HAD ME INSTALL,

05:17.087 --> 05:20.421
AND USE IT TO DESTROY THEM.

05:20.421 --> 05:23.754
YOU'LL USE IT
TO HELP US IDENTIFY THEM.

05:23.754 --> 05:26.357
RIGHT. THAT'S THE DEAL.

05:26.357 --> 05:28.359
ONE OF US NEEDS
TO GET THIS DEVICE

05:28.359 --> 05:30.801
CLOSE TO THE SECURITY GUARD'S
ACCESS CARD.
(beeps)

05:30.801 --> 05:34.765
THEN IT'LL TRANSMIT
ITS CODE TO MY CELL PHONE.

05:34.765 --> 05:37.808
OKAY. WE'LL JUST GET THE RIG
CLOSE TO THE SECURITY GUARD

05:37.808 --> 05:39.810
THAT WE'RE TRYING
TO COMPLETELY AVOID.

05:39.810 --> 05:42.873
THAT SOUNDS SIMPLE.
GOOD STUFF, SIMON.

05:42.873 --> 05:45.816
THIS IS GONNA
GET US INSIDE THE GATE.

05:45.816 --> 05:49.980
THIS IS GONNA GET US
INSIDE EVERYTHING.

05:49.980 --> 05:53.624
I KNOW YOU DON'T TRUST HIM.

05:53.624 --> 05:56.757
I TRUST YOU.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.089
IF YOU'RE HERE, I'M HERE.

05:59.089 --> 06:02.032
OHH.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:02.032 --> 06:04.034
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

06:04.034 --> 06:07.538
I THINK I DID IT
BACK IN MY APARTMENT.
OKAY, WE'RE GOING
TO THE HOSPITAL.

06:07.538 --> 06:09.670
NO, NO. WE HAVE
TO DO THIS TONIGHT.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.802
WE'RE NOT GONNA
GET A SECOND CHANCE.
JANIS.

06:11.802 --> 06:14.605
THE FBI'S NOT GONNA
LET HIM NEAR THAT MACHINE.

06:14.605 --> 06:16.607
CATCHING WHOEVER IS
BEHIND THE BLACKOUT

06:16.607 --> 06:19.049
IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

06:19.049 --> 06:21.051
YOU NEED TO DO THIS.

06:21.051 --> 06:23.884
PLEASE. DO IT FOR ME.

06:32.763 --> 06:34.064
(door buzzes)

06:42.903 --> 06:44.535
STAN--

06:44.535 --> 06:47.508
DON'T TELL ME
I WON'T REGRET DOING THIS.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.181
I ALREADY DO.

06:51.181 --> 06:53.183
LET'S GO.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.434
(siren wailing in distance)

07:14.434 --> 07:15.866
YOUR SNAPPING
ON HELLINGER LIKE THAT--

07:15.866 --> 07:19.009
I TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY.
I LET IT HAPPEN.

07:19.009 --> 07:20.971
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:20.971 --> 07:23.944
WE WERE SO FOCUSED ON FINDING
WHEN THE NEXT BLACKOUT IS,

07:23.944 --> 07:27.047
I HAVEN'T SEEN
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON WITH YOU.

07:27.047 --> 07:30.220
YEAH, I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO TALK TO YOU

07:30.220 --> 07:32.953
ABOUT YOUR PRIORITIES LATELY.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.655
(chuckles)

07:34.655 --> 07:36.927
(cell phone rings)

07:36.927 --> 07:38.859
(ring, beep)
WEDECK.

07:38.859 --> 07:42.062
(man) Sir, we've found two bombs
in the FBI with timers.

07:42.062 --> 07:45.996
There are probably more.
CALL IN THE BOMB SQUAD.
I'M ON MY WAY.

07:45.996 --> 07:48.769
GUESS YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.771
(tires screech)

07:58.148 --> 08:00.511
(tires screech, horn honks)

08:03.854 --> 08:05.556
HANDS ON THE WHEEL.

08:05.556 --> 08:07.558
HANDS ON THE WHEEL.

08:07.558 --> 08:09.860
GET OUT OF THE CAR SLOW.

08:09.860 --> 08:11.862
SLOW!

08:11.862 --> 08:13.223
I NEED HELP!

08:13.223 --> 08:16.226
MA'AM,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
(beeping)

08:16.226 --> 08:18.829
(whispers)
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?

08:18.829 --> 08:21.001
(whispers) WELL, SHE HAS
TO GET THE READER CLOSER.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.874
(strained voice) TRYING TO
FIND PACIFIC STATE HOSPITAL

08:23.874 --> 08:25.906
ON OLD LA HONDA.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.838
MA'AM? MA'AM?

08:27.838 --> 08:29.239
MA'AM?
(beep)

08:29.239 --> 08:32.613
(guard grunts)
(beep, door buzzes)

08:32.613 --> 08:35.946
(Simon, whispering) COME ON!
(Demetri, whispering) WAIT. THAT
LOOKED REAL. SHE WAS HURTING.

08:35.946 --> 08:38.889
I NEED AN AMBULANCE
AT LA HONDA ACCESS POINT.

08:38.889 --> 08:41.552
HE'S GETTING HER
TO A HOSPITAL. COME ON.
LA HONDA ACCESS POINT.

08:41.552 --> 08:44.825
(Charlie) WE SHOULD BE HOME NOW.
IT'S ALMOST 10:00.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.997
MM-HMM.

08:46.997 --> 08:49.930
WELL, WE'RE NOT.

08:49.930 --> 08:54.605
SO THEN...
THINGS CAN CHANGE?

08:54.605 --> 08:57.137
MM-HMM.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.870
DYLAN!

08:59.870 --> 09:02.242
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:02.242 --> 09:05.916
HI, CHARLIE.

09:05.916 --> 09:08.619
UH, SWEETIE, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE DYLAN TO THE CAR

09:08.619 --> 09:10.621
AND GO GET HIM A JUICE BOX?

09:10.621 --> 09:12.623
OKAY. COME ON, DYLAN.

09:14.985 --> 09:17.327
HOW DID YOU FIND US?
UH, WELL, ACTUALLY, UM,

09:17.327 --> 09:20.030
MY PEOPLE CALLED YOUR PEOPLE.

09:20.030 --> 09:22.092
THE BODYGUARDS?

09:22.092 --> 09:24.965
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,
I THINK I WAS ON THE VERGE

09:24.965 --> 09:27.137
OF--OF FIGURING OUT
SOMETHING REALLY CRUCIAL,

09:27.137 --> 09:30.871
BUT I THINK FOR THAT TO HAPPEN,
I HAVE TO BE AT YOUR HOUSE.

09:30.871 --> 09:33.573
I HAVE TO RECREATE
THOSE CONDITIONS.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.205
TELL YOU WHAT--
WHY DON'T YOU LET YOURSELF IN?

09:35.205 --> 09:37.978
AND THEN YOU RECREATE
ALL THE CONDITIONS YOU WANT.
LISTEN TO ME. LISTEN.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.080
YOU'RE PART OF IT--

09:40.080 --> 09:41.782
YOU AND CHARLIE.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.284
IT'S LIKE GABRIEL SAID.
YOU'RE PART OF THE PUZZLE.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.857
HOW, EXACTLY?
I DON'T KNOW.

09:46.857 --> 09:50.120
I JUST KNOW THAT YOU ARE.
THIS IS BIGGER THAN YOU AND ME.
WE CAN'T STOP IT. I'VE TRIED.

09:50.120 --> 09:53.694
MARK PUSHED ME AWAY
TO SAVE THE WORLD--
NO, I CAN'T PUSH YOU AWAY.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.927
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
I CAN'T DO THIS ALONE.

09:56.927 --> 09:58.699
MAYBE YOU SHOULD.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.271
YOU'RE PART OF THE EQUATION,

10:01.271 --> 10:03.804
AND I CANNOT DO IT
WITHOUT YOU.

10:07.978 --> 10:09.680
(cell phone beeps)

10:12.382 --> 10:14.815
WHAT, UH,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:14.815 --> 10:16.817
DID YOU FIND HER?

10:16.817 --> 10:18.789
THEY JUST RELEASED HER.

10:18.789 --> 10:21.822
I GOT A CONTACT NUMBER
FOR HER.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.824
IT'S, UM...
(beep)

10:23.824 --> 10:26.226
IT'S THE RESTAURANT
WHERE I SAW HER

10:26.226 --> 10:29.760
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD.
TURNS OUT IT'S IN L.A.

10:29.760 --> 10:33.003
IT'S ALL COMING TRUE FOR YOU.

10:33.003 --> 10:35.736
LOOK, BRYCE, I-I...

10:35.736 --> 10:38.068
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
THAT I'M SORRY.

10:38.068 --> 10:40.340
YOU KNOW, SHE FLEW ALL THE WAY
ACROSS THE PACIFIC OCEAN

10:40.340 --> 10:42.773
JUST TO MEET YOU, AND I...

10:42.773 --> 10:46.276
I TRIED TO KEEP YOU APART.
NO, I'M SORRY.

10:46.276 --> 10:49.019
THIS WHOLE THING IS MY FAULT.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.953
I'M SORRY.

10:52.953 --> 10:56.987
I'VE BEEN IGNORING THE TRUTH,
THE FEELINGS THAT I HAD.

10:56.987 --> 10:58.889
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY,

10:58.889 --> 11:01.862
BUT I LOVE HER.

11:01.862 --> 11:06.867
THIS WHOLE THING WITH HER
WAS MEANT TO BE.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.869
I MEAN, I PUT THESE ON
THIS MORNING

11:08.869 --> 11:11.071
WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT.

11:11.071 --> 11:15.876
IT WASN'T UNTIL HALF AN HOUR AGO
THAT I REALIZED

11:15.876 --> 11:20.210
THIS IS WHAT I WAS WEARING
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD.

11:20.210 --> 11:22.182
I GOTTA GO.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.985
YEAH. YOU SHOULD GO.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.800
(woman) ALL LIQUIDS, GELS
AND AEROSOLS

11:39.800 --> 11:42.102
MUST BE IN 3-OUNCE OR SMALLER
CONTAINERS.

11:42.102 --> 11:45.135
(speaking foreign language)

12:01.792 --> 12:03.954
(speaking Japanese)

12:15.205 --> 12:16.767
UHH!

12:16.767 --> 12:21.311
(speaking Japanese)

12:33.053 --> 12:36.056
(shouting in Japanese)

12:39.830 --> 12:42.762
(siren whoops)

12:42.762 --> 12:44.034
(brakes squeal)

12:44.034 --> 12:45.165
(helicopter whirring)

12:45.165 --> 12:47.968
(Mark) NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
HEAR ME OUT. WAIT.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.970
HEAR ME OUT.
WHOEVER PUT THOSE BOMBS IN THERE

12:49.970 --> 12:52.042
IS TARGETING
SOMETHING SPECIFIC.

12:52.042 --> 12:55.946
SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT.
SO HELP ME, MARK, ALL
THE GLORIOUS CHOIRS OF HEAVEN,

12:55.946 --> 12:59.079
IF YOU STEP OUT OF THIS CAR, I
WILL HAVE YOUR HEAD ON A PLATE.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.151
I'M GONNA SEND OVER
A DRIVER.

13:01.151 --> 13:03.914
STAY IN THE CAR.

13:03.914 --> 13:06.156
(man speaking indistinctly)

13:06.156 --> 13:08.959
YOU NEED A FRIEND,
SO I TRACKED HIM DOWN FOR YOU.

13:08.959 --> 13:10.991
(beep, phone ringing)

13:10.991 --> 13:12.963
SOMEONE TO KEEP YOU COMPANY
WHILE YOU WAIT.

13:12.963 --> 13:15.125
(ring)

13:15.125 --> 13:17.027
(ring, beep)
HELLO?

13:17.027 --> 13:19.830
AARON, IT'S MARK.
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

13:19.830 --> 13:22.802
Listen, I'm okay,
but I talked to Wedeck,

13:22.802 --> 13:25.105
and I need to know
what's going on with you.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.007
I DON'T KNOW.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.840
I JUST KIND OF LOST IT.

13:29.840 --> 13:32.943
AND THEN...

13:32.943 --> 13:35.986
AND THEN I STARTED TO DRINK.

13:35.986 --> 13:39.920
YOU KNOW...

13:39.920 --> 13:43.053
SOMETIMES WHAT HAPPENS
IN THE WORLD MAKES US FORGET

13:43.053 --> 13:45.025
it's all up to us.
We have choices--

13:45.025 --> 13:47.197
you, me...

13:47.197 --> 13:48.899
TRACY.

13:50.901 --> 13:54.034
You choose what's next,
and you'll wind up

13:54.034 --> 13:56.406
right where
you're supposed to be.

13:56.406 --> 13:58.408
Take care of yourself,
Mark.

13:58.408 --> 14:00.470
OKAY.

14:02.913 --> 14:05.545
(man shouting indistinctly,
siren wailing)

14:05.545 --> 14:07.617
AGENT BENFORD.

14:07.617 --> 14:09.619
BEEN CELEBRATING?

14:09.619 --> 14:11.621
A LITTLE.

14:11.621 --> 14:14.925
HAD TO GET BACK
TO THE OFFICE, THOUGH.

14:14.925 --> 14:16.887
LOOSE ENDS.

14:16.887 --> 14:18.889
THERE'S NOTHING
TO SEE UP THERE, MARK.

14:18.889 --> 14:21.191
IT'S A FOOL'S ERRAND.

14:21.191 --> 14:24.094
LAST TIME I LISTENED TO YOU,
I TOOK MY EYES OFF THE PRIZE.

14:24.094 --> 14:26.937
NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

14:28.638 --> 14:31.071
I HAVE TO GO.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.073
GOT A LITTLE ERRAND TO RUN.

14:55.125 --> 14:57.127
I HAVE A NEW GOLDFISH
NAMED SADIE.

14:57.127 --> 14:59.899
CAN I SEE IT?
COME ON. IT'S UPSTAIRS.

14:59.899 --> 15:03.333
I WANT COOKIES AFTER.
DYLAN, THAT'S NOT HOW WE ASK.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.936
(Olivia) IT'S OKAY.
MI CASA ES SU CASA.

15:05.936 --> 15:08.408
THAT MEANS MY HOUSE
IS YOUR HOUSE, TOO.
IT'S MY HOUSE, TOO.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.409
COME ON.
SO...

15:09.409 --> 15:13.283
SO...

15:13.283 --> 15:15.285
UH, 9:33.

15:15.285 --> 15:19.319
27 MINUTES
TILL YOUR EPIPHANY.

15:19.319 --> 15:23.153
YEAH. UH... OKAY.

15:23.153 --> 15:26.026
I THINK I'D BETTER
GET TO WORK.

15:26.026 --> 15:28.028
ALL RIGHT.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.062
SO HOW--HOW DOES THIS WORK?

15:32.062 --> 15:35.465
WE JUST TAKE OUR POSITIONS
AT 10:00,

15:35.465 --> 15:37.637
WAIT FOR YOUR BREAKTHROUGH?

15:37.637 --> 15:40.710
YEAH, I THINK I'LL
KEEP MY SHIRT ON THIS TIME.

15:40.710 --> 15:42.142
OKAY.

15:42.142 --> 15:45.145
(whirring)

15:53.123 --> 15:54.454
(beep)

15:54.454 --> 15:57.157
(door whooshes)

15:57.157 --> 16:00.460
(beep)
WHAT THE HELL?

16:00.460 --> 16:02.692
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
OPEN THIS DOOR.

16:02.692 --> 16:05.965
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
WAIT, LET ME JUST--
NOW, SIMON!

16:05.965 --> 16:08.438
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
I KNEW YOU'D TRY
TO PULL SOMETHING,

16:08.438 --> 16:11.371
YOU SOCIOPATHIC, LYING SON...

16:11.371 --> 16:13.743
YOU'RE WELCOME. COME ON IN.

16:16.246 --> 16:19.279
YOUR FRIEND ASKED YOU
TO TRUST ME.

16:19.279 --> 16:22.012
JANIS WANTED ME TO HELP YOU.
I DO NOT TRUST YOU.

16:27.417 --> 16:31.721
THIS IS THE LAST PIECE
OF LEVERAGE I HAVE LEFT.

16:31.721 --> 16:36.066
AND NOW YOU HAVE IT.

16:36.066 --> 16:38.098
LET'S GET TO WORK.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.031
SHALL WE?

16:43.603 --> 16:46.306
(helicopter whirring)

16:46.306 --> 16:48.038
(man) Confirming devices

16:48.038 --> 16:50.340
on floors five,
six and ten, over.

16:50.340 --> 16:52.342
(Vogel) YOU GOT A DET TIME?

16:52.342 --> 16:54.314
Affirmative.
36 minutes and counting.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.316
COPY THAT.

16:57.747 --> 17:00.050
WHAT'S THE UPDATE?

17:00.050 --> 17:03.793
BOMBS, MARK. WE'VE LOCATED THEM
ON AT LEAST FIVE FLOORS.

17:03.793 --> 17:06.256
THIS IS BIGGER
THAN HELLINGER.

17:06.256 --> 17:08.298
YEAH. HE'S JUST
A LINK IN THE CHAIN.

17:08.298 --> 17:10.300
THEY'RE COMING AFTER MOSAIC.

17:10.300 --> 17:14.164
ARE YOU ABOUT TO DO WHAT
I THINK YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO?

17:14.164 --> 17:17.067
YOUR CHANCES OF MAKING IT
OUT OF THERE ARE NOT GOOD.

17:17.067 --> 17:19.038
I NEED YOU TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.040
IF THEY'RE
COMING AFTER MOSAIC,

17:21.040 --> 17:22.712
LLOYD SIMCOE IS NOT SAFE,
EITHER.

17:22.712 --> 17:25.075
NOW I'VE GOT THIS COVERED.

17:25.075 --> 17:26.476
I'LL SECURE SIMCOE.

17:26.476 --> 17:28.448
YOU CAN FIND HIM AT--
YOUR HOUSE.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.350
IT'S WHAT I SAW. IT'S...

17:30.350 --> 17:34.384
IT'S WHERE I'M GOING, RIGHT?

17:34.384 --> 17:36.786
RIGHT.

17:36.786 --> 17:38.488
LOCK IT DOWN.

17:38.488 --> 17:41.291
YOU SHOULD KNOW
I ALSO SAW MYSELF

17:41.291 --> 17:43.763
TELLING ANOTHER AGENT
YOU WERE DEAD.

17:47.367 --> 17:51.141
LLOYD SIMCOE'S KEY.
WE NEED HIM ALIVE.
SAME GOES FOR YOU.

17:51.141 --> 17:54.244
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.083
MOM, COME HERE!

18:07.117 --> 18:09.359
MY GOD.

18:13.223 --> 18:16.226
HE GOT INTO YOUR LIPSTICK
AND JUST STARTED WRITING.

18:17.767 --> 18:20.730
IT'S THE FORMULA
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD.

18:20.730 --> 18:22.402
THIS IS WHAT I SAW.

18:22.402 --> 18:25.205
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

18:26.736 --> 18:28.738
I ALWAYS ASSUMED
I'D WRITTEN IT.

18:30.740 --> 18:34.414
I GUESS DYLAN MUST HAVE
MEMORIZED IT THIS AFTERNOON.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.786
IS HE IN TROUBLE?

18:36.786 --> 18:37.817
NO.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.350
CAN WE GET COOKIES NOW?

18:40.350 --> 18:41.851
SURE.

18:41.851 --> 18:44.854
UH, CHARLIE, WHY DON'T
YOU TAKE DYLAN DOWNSTAIRS

18:44.854 --> 18:47.197
AND SHOW HIM WHERE THEY ARE?

18:47.197 --> 18:49.199
I WILL,
BUT HE ALREADY KNOWS.

18:49.199 --> 18:52.632
COME ON, DYLAN.

18:52.632 --> 18:57.237
SO WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

18:57.237 --> 19:01.241
THIS EQUATION
SOMEHOW LINKS THE Q.E.D.,

19:01.241 --> 19:04.143
THE BLUEPRINTS
AND THE FLASH-FORWARD

19:04.143 --> 19:05.875
ALL TOGETHER.

19:05.875 --> 19:07.877
BUT IT'S A MATH PROBLEM,
RIGHT?

19:07.877 --> 19:12.322
HOW WOULD IT POSSIBLY TIE
ALL THOSE THINGS TOGETHER?

19:12.322 --> 19:15.455
IT'S THE TACHYON CONSTANT.

19:16.786 --> 19:20.290
IT'S THE GREATEST MYSTERY
IN ALL OF QUANTUM PHYSICS.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.164
AND I HAVE TO SOLVE IT...

19:26.896 --> 19:29.539
RIGHT NOW.

19:35.845 --> 19:38.908
(man)
EVACUATE THE ENTIRE BUILDING!

19:40.880 --> 19:43.613
CLEAR, BLUE TEAM! CLEAR!

20:01.801 --> 20:04.534
(woman)
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

20:04.534 --> 20:07.977
I'M REALLY HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

20:07.977 --> 20:10.810
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.
THAT'S WHAT WE SAW, RIGHT?

20:10.810 --> 20:13.683
I HAVEN'T FELT HER MOVE
IN THREE HOURS.

20:13.683 --> 20:15.785
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
AN ULTRASOUND.

20:15.785 --> 20:18.388
READY.
OKAY.

20:18.388 --> 20:19.819
HE'S WHERE?

20:19.819 --> 20:22.852
HE'S IN THE BUILDING
WITH THE BOMBS...

20:22.852 --> 20:26.656
WHERE I LEFT MY CAR KEYS.

20:26.656 --> 20:29.799
WE'VE GOT 23 MINUTES
UNTIL THE BUILDING GOES.

20:29.799 --> 20:32.362
WE'VE GOTTA GET BENFORD.

20:34.704 --> 20:38.508
THE ANSWERS WILL COME.

20:38.508 --> 20:40.940
YOU SOUND SO CERTAIN.

20:40.940 --> 20:45.445
AT 10:00 P.M.,
THE ANSWERS WILL COME...

20:45.445 --> 20:47.917
BECAUSE THEY WILL.

20:47.917 --> 20:50.780
IT'S NOT ABOUT EQUATIONS.

20:50.780 --> 20:56.726
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE TWO OF US
JUST PHYSICALLY BEING HERE.

20:56.726 --> 21:00.360
IT'S ABOUT THIS MOMENT...

21:00.360 --> 21:02.492
RIGHT HERE.

21:04.894 --> 21:09.739
I'VE FOUGHT IT
AND RESISTED IT,

21:09.739 --> 21:12.902
AND YET HERE IT IS.

21:12.902 --> 21:16.646
IT HAPPENED.

21:16.646 --> 21:18.848
THE FUTURE HAPPENED.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.690
ALL OF IT?

21:45.034 --> 21:48.938
(gunfire)

21:48.938 --> 21:51.581
SOMEBODY MEANS BUSINESS.
YEAH, YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

21:51.581 --> 21:53.613
YOU WANT UP OR DOWN?

21:53.613 --> 21:55.385
DOWN.

21:55.385 --> 21:57.617
GO FOR IT.
I GOT YOU COVERED.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.960
I'M EXACTLY WHERE
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.839
I'M SORRY.
YOU CAN'T COME IN.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.341
PLEASE, PLEASE. I'M--I'M
SUPPOSED TO MEET A WOMAN HERE.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.973
I LEARNED JAPANESE.

22:23.973 --> 22:25.975
(speaking Japanese)

22:28.978 --> 22:31.951
(speaking Japanese)

22:31.951 --> 22:33.953
PRIVATE PARTY...

22:37.627 --> 22:40.630
PLEASE--
AH! KEIKO...
(speaking Japanese)

22:49.539 --> 22:50.940
THANK YOU.

22:50.940 --> 22:53.943
(horns honking)

22:56.075 --> 22:58.948
TRY A DIFFERENT STREET,
PLEASE.

22:58.948 --> 23:00.850
WHEN I CAN GET TO ONE.

23:00.850 --> 23:03.853
I MEAN, THE TRAFFIC'S NUTS.

23:05.515 --> 23:07.517
OKAY.

23:09.088 --> 23:12.161
I NEED TO GO. THANK YOU.

23:27.937 --> 23:29.939
(horn honks)

23:29.939 --> 23:32.542
(tires screech)

23:50.600 --> 23:53.432
(cheering)

23:53.432 --> 23:55.865
(man) ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.
IT'S ALMOST 10:00.

23:55.865 --> 23:59.639
FIVE MORE MINUTES TILL
WE CATCH UP TO OUR FUTURE!

24:03.813 --> 24:06.616
YOU INSTALLED THE SOFTWARE.
NOW YOU CAN'T FIND THE FILE?

24:06.616 --> 24:08.117
I'M JUST NOT SEEING IT YET.

24:08.117 --> 24:10.480
BEER?
BEER?

24:10.480 --> 24:13.923
(door squeaks)
HELPS ME COGITATE.

24:13.923 --> 24:16.085
YOU KNOW,
JANIS IS GONNA BE OKAY.

24:16.085 --> 24:17.857
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

24:17.857 --> 24:20.830
SHE SAW IT
IN HER FLASH-FORWARD.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET GOING.

24:20.830 --> 24:24.063
SOMEONE COULD WALK
IN HERE ANY SECOND.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.836
(Demetri)
IT'S ALMOST 10:00.
(beep)

24:26.836 --> 24:28.838
(typing)

24:28.838 --> 24:32.171
I'M SUPPOSED TO SEND
LLOYD A TEXT.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.077
WHAT IS THAT, MATH?

24:38.077 --> 24:41.480
(beeps)
IT'S AN EQUATION FOR
A DAMPED 1-DIMENSIONAL WAVE.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.954
IT WAS LLOYD'S E-MAIL SIGNATURE
FOR YEARS...
(beeps)

24:44.954 --> 24:46.886
A DAMPED WAVE.

24:46.886 --> 24:50.219
HE USED TO CALL IT
HIS "TEARFUL GOOD-BYE."

24:50.219 --> 24:53.993
THAT'S CUTE.
IS THAT PHYSICS HUMOR?

24:53.993 --> 24:55.825
WELL, I'M SUPPOSED
TO SEND HIM SOMETHING.

24:55.825 --> 24:57.967
HE SAW IT.

24:57.967 --> 25:01.731
AN INSIDE JOKE
FOR AN INSIDE JOKE.

25:01.731 --> 25:03.002
(beeping)

25:03.002 --> 25:04.734
(beep)

25:04.734 --> 25:07.036
(typing)

25:07.036 --> 25:10.680
(man) FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE!

25:10.680 --> 25:12.882
IT'S 10:00, EVERYBODY!

25:12.882 --> 25:14.884
(cheering)

25:21.721 --> 25:24.724
(water gurgling)

25:42.011 --> 25:45.845
(cell phone chirps)
IT'S THE TEXT
FROM--FROM SIMON.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.879
A WAVE.

25:49.879 --> 25:53.052
GOOD GOD.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.284
I HAVE TO MAKE A CALL.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.631
(ringing)

26:01.631 --> 26:03.593
(scoffs)

26:03.593 --> 26:04.864
YEAH.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.666
IT'S ME.
Did you crack it?

26:06.666 --> 26:10.670
LOOK, THE CONSTANT I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR--IT ISN'T A NUMBER.

26:10.670 --> 26:11.941
IT'S A WAVE.

26:11.941 --> 26:14.604
If I plug the wave
into the blueprint equation,

26:14.604 --> 26:17.346
I get an interval which, if
added to the previous blackout,

26:17.346 --> 26:19.979
tells us--
TELLS US WHAT, LLOYD?

26:19.979 --> 26:22.782
AS PRECISELY AS I CAN TELL,

26:22.782 --> 26:26.115
THE NEXT BLACKOUT IS
SOMETIME IN APRIL 2010--

26:26.115 --> 26:28.958
which means
it's in the next two days.

26:28.958 --> 26:31.160
Mark? Mark?
Are you still there?

26:31.160 --> 26:34.223
APRIL? APRIL?

26:34.223 --> 26:37.196
2010?

26:37.196 --> 26:39.929
(crowd shouting and cheering)

26:39.929 --> 26:43.633
(panting)

26:43.633 --> 26:45.675
(people speaking Japanese)

27:02.792 --> 27:05.725
(whimpering)

27:07.626 --> 27:10.900
(beeps)

27:10.900 --> 27:12.962
THE BABY'S FINE.

27:12.962 --> 27:16.035
GOOD HEARTBEAT.

27:16.035 --> 27:18.037
BUT IT'S A BOY.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.841
IT'S A BOY?

27:23.042 --> 27:25.044
YOU DISAPPOINTED?

27:25.044 --> 27:27.046
NO.

27:28.918 --> 27:31.150
JUST SURPRISED.

27:31.150 --> 27:34.684
FUTURE IS LIKE THAT.

27:34.684 --> 27:35.925
YEAH.

27:47.967 --> 27:50.970
(gunfire)

27:52.972 --> 27:55.074
(shell casings clatter)

27:57.276 --> 27:59.048
(beeping)

27:59.048 --> 28:00.910
(door whooshes open)

28:00.910 --> 28:03.052
(gunfire)

28:13.422 --> 28:16.425
(helicopter whirring)

28:19.098 --> 28:22.732
GOD, WE'RE ALMOST
THROUGH THIS THING.

28:22.732 --> 28:25.775
FINALLY GO BACK TO
THE WAY THINGS USED TO BE--

28:25.775 --> 28:28.377
WHERE THE ONLY STUFF WE SEE

28:28.377 --> 28:31.080
IS WHAT'S
RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.883
WELCOME TO THE FUTURE.

28:35.785 --> 28:37.086
WHO DID THIS?

28:37.086 --> 28:40.089
THE STRINGS ARE DIFFERENT.
THEY MOVED.

28:42.151 --> 28:44.824
GABRIEL.

28:44.824 --> 28:47.296
MAKE IT LOOK RIGHT.
YOU MAKE IT LOOK RIGHT.

28:47.296 --> 28:50.800
(whispering)
GABRIEL. GABRIEL.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.863
GABRIEL. GABRIEL.
GABRIEL.

29:01.070 --> 29:03.012
APRIL...

29:05.344 --> 29:06.745
BLACK...

29:08.477 --> 29:09.979
OUT.

29:09.979 --> 29:12.451
"T."

29:14.283 --> 29:15.785
"T."

29:18.027 --> 29:19.859
"E."

29:22.061 --> 29:24.033

29:35.474 --> 29:38.277
N. P.M.

29:41.450 --> 29:43.813
(gasps)

29:43.813 --> 29:46.315
APRIL 29th.

29:46.315 --> 29:49.488
10:14.

29:49.488 --> 29:53.062
THE BLACKOUT--
IT'S IN 12 MINUTES.

29:53.062 --> 29:54.994
(elevator bell dings)

29:54.994 --> 29:56.996
(elevator door opens)

30:02.101 --> 30:04.803
(electronic whir)

30:14.984 --> 30:17.486
THE COMMAND SYSTEM
WON'T LET ME ACCESS IT.

30:17.486 --> 30:19.548
WHAT WAS IT YOU SAID EARLIER?

30:19.548 --> 30:22.551
NOW THE ONLY THING WE CAN SEE
IS WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF US?

30:22.551 --> 30:25.925
(beep)
WHOEVER DID THIS MAY HAVE
COPIED THE ENTIRE MAINFRAME,

30:25.925 --> 30:28.197
CREATED SOME KIND OF CLONE.

30:28.197 --> 30:32.361
WAIT. SO WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS A...
A FAKE, DESIGNED TO PREVENT ME
FROM GETTING IN.

30:32.361 --> 30:35.134
THEY KNEW I'D BE BACK.

30:35.134 --> 30:36.906
REMEMBER ME?

30:36.906 --> 30:41.010
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS BACKDOOR
INTO MY ARCHIVED ACCOUNT,

30:41.010 --> 30:43.072
COMPARE THE SYSTEM,

30:43.072 --> 30:45.074
COMPARE THE CODE...

30:45.074 --> 30:49.018
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

30:49.018 --> 30:50.980
BYE-BYE.

30:50.980 --> 30:53.022
(beeps)

30:53.022 --> 30:54.884
YOU GOT IT?

30:54.884 --> 30:56.886
DOWNLOADING IT FOR YOU NOW.

30:56.886 --> 30:58.888
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU
WORK FOR, MR. HELLINGER,

30:58.888 --> 31:00.960
BUT WHOEVER THEY ARE,
THEY WON'T BE VERY HAPPY

31:00.960 --> 31:03.933
THAT YOU DIDN'T
PREVENT THIS...

31:03.933 --> 31:05.594
NOT AT ALL.
(beeping)

31:05.594 --> 31:07.997
DONE.
WHATEVER YOU'LL NEED

31:07.997 --> 31:09.899
TO TRACK THE BASTARDS
IS IN HERE.

31:09.899 --> 31:12.071
(fireworks whistling
in distance)

31:13.903 --> 31:16.045
OKAY.

31:16.045 --> 31:17.346
HEY. SWEETIE, GO.

31:17.346 --> 31:19.348
GO. GO PLAY WITH DYLAN.

31:20.950 --> 31:23.953
MARK BENFORD IS DEAD.

31:23.953 --> 31:27.386
HE RAN INTO THE BUILDING.
DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE.

31:27.386 --> 31:30.389
(electronic whirring)

31:45.104 --> 31:48.637
(cell phone rings)

32:24.943 --> 32:27.476
(coughing)
OKAY. HEY, HEY, HEY,
HEY, HEY. ARE YOU OKAY?

32:27.476 --> 32:30.079
CAREFUL.

32:30.079 --> 32:32.351
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:32.351 --> 32:36.285
YOU WENT OFF THE ROAD
INTO THE LAKE.

32:36.285 --> 32:39.088
I-I WASN'T EVEN SURE
YOU WERE WITH US.

32:39.088 --> 32:41.360
THEN I PULLED YOU
OUT OF THE CAR,

32:41.360 --> 32:44.093
AND YOU STARTED FIGHTING ME.

32:44.093 --> 32:46.335
HEY, COME ON.
HEY, YOU MUST BE FREEZING.

32:46.335 --> 32:47.966
HERE.
OKAY.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.698
THERE.
(coughs)

32:49.698 --> 32:52.101
HEY, IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

32:54.543 --> 32:57.076
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD, I...

32:57.076 --> 33:00.079
I SAW MYSELF SAVING YOU.

33:00.079 --> 33:02.311
AND ALL THESE MONTHS...

33:02.311 --> 33:05.514
I THOUGHT MAYBE I FAILED.

33:05.514 --> 33:07.216
(chuckles)

33:07.216 --> 33:09.718
I'M, UH...

33:09.718 --> 33:13.422
I'M REALLY HAPPY
THAT I DIDN'T.

33:13.422 --> 33:16.765
YOU SAW ME?

33:16.765 --> 33:20.229
YEAH.

33:20.229 --> 33:24.633
OKAY. AN AMBULANCE IS
ON ITS WAY, OKAY?

33:24.633 --> 33:26.075
HEY.

33:26.075 --> 33:28.077
MY NAME'S ED.

33:29.738 --> 33:32.711
NICOLE.

33:32.711 --> 33:34.613
(beeping)

33:34.613 --> 33:36.515
WHAT?

33:36.515 --> 33:39.088
(groans)
WHAT IS IT?

33:39.088 --> 33:42.020
SOMEONE'S ACCESSING
THE MAINFRAME FROM OUTSIDE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

33:42.020 --> 33:44.353
IT'S A DIFFERENT
COMMAND SYSTEM

33:44.353 --> 33:46.725
ORIGINATING OFF-SITE.

33:46.725 --> 33:49.558
THEY HAVE CONTROL.

33:49.558 --> 33:51.460
(typing on keyboard)

33:51.460 --> 33:55.064
(automated female voice)
COMMENCING ACTIVATION SEQUENCE.

33:55.064 --> 33:58.367
(alarm blaring, rapid beeping,
electronic whirring)

34:30.769 --> 34:31.840
(gunfire)

34:31.840 --> 34:33.772
(grunts)

34:37.446 --> 34:41.110
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, SIMON?
GET AWAY FROM THERE.

34:41.110 --> 34:43.312
PUT YOUR HANDS UP! NOW!

35:03.202 --> 35:05.204
(breathing heavily)

35:07.236 --> 35:09.208
YOU LYING SON OF A BITCH.
(alarm blaring)

35:09.208 --> 35:12.211
(fires)
HEY, I DIDN'T DO THIS,
DEMETRI,

35:12.211 --> 35:14.213
NOT THEN
AND CERTAINLY NOT NOW!

35:14.213 --> 35:17.546
I'M GOING TO LET THEM
DO THIS TO ME, DEMETRI.

35:17.546 --> 35:20.289
I WON'T LET THEM TURN ME
INTO A MONSTER,

35:20.289 --> 35:23.292
TO USE MY MACHINE, MY MIND.
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, DEMETRI--

35:23.292 --> 35:26.725
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
DON'T DESERVE TO DIE.

35:26.725 --> 35:29.428
KNOW WHAT?
YOU WANT TO STOP ME?

35:29.428 --> 35:31.900
YOU WANT TO STOP ME
FROM DOING WHAT I'M DOING,

35:31.900 --> 35:33.902
WHICH IS TRYING TO SHUT DOWN
THIS MACHINE?

35:33.902 --> 35:36.505
THEN YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO SHOOT ME.

35:44.673 --> 35:46.815
(door squeaks open)

36:17.846 --> 36:19.278
(loud whoosh)

36:46.335 --> 36:48.777
(elevator bell dings)

36:48.777 --> 36:52.441
(yelling)

36:52.441 --> 36:55.344
(grunts)

36:55.344 --> 36:57.946
(panting)

37:21.670 --> 37:23.412
(cell phone rings)
YEAH?

37:23.412 --> 37:26.345
It's Mark.
YOU'RE STILL IN THE BUILDING?

37:26.345 --> 37:28.347
Get the hell out now!

37:28.347 --> 37:31.380
THE NEXT BLACKOUT--
I FIGURED IT OUT, STAN.

37:31.380 --> 37:35.784
IT'S GONNA BE AT 10:14 P.M.
PACIFIC TONIGHT.

37:35.784 --> 37:38.927
Call the White House, EBS,
NTSB, everyone.

37:38.927 --> 37:42.791
THIS PLACE IS ABOUT TO GO
IN THREE MINUTES. MOVE NOW!

37:42.791 --> 37:45.664
(whispers)
MAKE THE CALL, STAN.

37:49.568 --> 37:52.501
(helicopter whirring)
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
STANFORD WEDECK. YES.

37:52.501 --> 37:54.503
PUT ME THROUGH

38:15.624 --> 38:18.367

38:18.367 --> 38:22.771

(sighs)

38:25.604 --> 38:26.835
MARK!

38:26.835 --> 38:28.977
(whispering)
Livy, listen very carefully.

38:28.977 --> 38:30.779
THE NEXT BLACKOUT'S
ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

38:30.779 --> 38:34.343
TAKE CHARLIE,
GET HER SOMEWHERE SAFE.

38:34.343 --> 38:36.615
It's gonna happen
in about two minutes.

38:36.615 --> 38:39.047
TELL HER I LOVE HER.

38:39.047 --> 38:42.521
I LOVE YOU BOTH.

38:42.521 --> 38:45.524
Please be safe, Mark.
Good-bye, Livy.

38:52.761 --> 38:55.103
"PRESIDENT SEGOVIA HAS ISSUED
AN EVACUATION ORDER

"IN LIGHT OF CREDIBLE REPORTS

38:58.837 --> 39:01.710
HE'S URGING IMMEDIATE STEPS
TO BE TAKEN

39:01.710 --> 39:03.912
TO ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY
AND IS APPEALING FOR CALM.

39:03.912 --> 39:06.975
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO PUT THAT RING ON.

39:06.975 --> 39:11.620
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DIDN'T SEE
MY FUTURE THE LAST TIME AROUND.

39:11.620 --> 39:15.053
I'M NOT GONNA MISS IT THIS TIME.
YOU WANT IT?

39:15.053 --> 39:17.055
I'VE SEEN MY FUTURE.

39:17.055 --> 39:19.958
THIS IS IT... RIGHT NOW.

(gun cocks)

39:26.364 --> 39:28.797
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

39:36.044 --> 39:38.146
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SIT DOWN
FOR THIS ONE.
(rapid beeping)

39:38.146 --> 39:40.378
READY?

39:42.080 --> 39:45.083
