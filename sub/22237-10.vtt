00:00.631 --> 00:02.277
- Andy!
- Guys!

00:02.283 --> 00:04.570
If you got yourself there,
why can't you get yourself back?

00:04.576 --> 00:05.701
That wasn't me.

00:05.707 --> 00:07.895
Why wouldn't Alice
want us to talk to Andy?

00:07.901 --> 00:09.252
Because she put him there.

00:09.258 --> 00:13.390
I've been researching missing persons.
Jane Upton, William Quayle, Alice Hartley.

00:13.396 --> 00:15.792
Whatever happened to them
happened to Andy.

00:15.798 --> 00:18.943
From earth you came.
To earth return.

00:18.949 --> 00:20.242
She was never real!

00:20.248 --> 00:23.252
Here's your precious talisman!
Better get Andy back with it!

00:23.258 --> 00:25.885
What if you could walk again?
Would I help you?

00:25.891 --> 00:27.558
Oscar, how did you do this?

00:27.645 --> 00:29.955
- No!
- I don't know what's happening!

00:30.830 --> 00:32.310
Oscar!

00:32.366 --> 00:34.817
- Stop this, Alice!
- Not until I get the talisman.

00:34.818 --> 00:37.909
- Bring him down.
- You can't do this!

00:37.956 --> 00:39.153
No!

00:39.200 --> 00:40.300
Halt.

00:47.198 --> 00:48.937
What have you done?!

Synced by Reef
addic7ed.com

01:57.328 --> 02:00.680
- Careful.
- Yep... there.

02:01.778 --> 02:05.185
- Felix, what were you thinking?
- I had to make a choice.

02:05.191 --> 02:08.193
It wasn't yours to make.
It affects all of us!

02:08.209 --> 02:11.679
- Especially Andy.
- What would you have done, Jake?

02:12.235 --> 02:15.796
Guys, Alice and Phoebe -
they're gone.

02:19.497 --> 02:21.626
After what you've done,
you just walk away?

02:21.632 --> 02:23.153
It's not what you think.

02:23.170 --> 02:26.197
What am I supposed to think?
You had that poor kid up a tree!

02:26.203 --> 02:28.781
I was never gonna hurt him.
I just needed leverage.

02:28.830 --> 02:31.789
Leverage? You can't be serious!

02:32.036 --> 02:35.067
I had to make sure
they couldn't use the talisman.

02:35.068 --> 02:40.027
Why? What is going on, Alice?
What's this really about?

02:40.028 --> 02:42.384
You won't believe it, Phoebes.

02:42.833 --> 02:44.360
Tell me.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.524
I'll show you.

03:01.882 --> 03:05.488
I just don't get it. Why would
Alice destroy the talisman?

03:05.494 --> 03:08.672
Something that powerful...
it doesn't make sense.

03:08.725 --> 03:11.351
Why does Alice even care about Andy?

03:11.431 --> 03:16.022
Well she put Andy there, and now she's
trying to stop us bringing him home.

03:16.079 --> 03:18.148
Isn't Alice lucky
she's got you on her side?

03:18.154 --> 03:19.786
- Jake, stop it!
- That's not fair!

03:19.792 --> 03:21.977
- You helped her out.
- What was I supposed to do?

03:21.983 --> 03:24.607
Not give away our only chance
of getting Andy back.

03:24.613 --> 03:27.179
My brothers are losers, but if
something bad ever happened to them...

03:27.185 --> 03:29.140
Someone had to do something.

03:29.146 --> 03:31.564
Seriously? You think Felix
did the right thing?

03:31.570 --> 03:33.554
So you'd have let him fall?

03:37.056 --> 03:40.081
- You hear that?
- What was that?

03:41.226 --> 03:45.361
- Alice and Phoebe...?
- I vote not sticking around to find out.

03:47.048 --> 03:49.387
Guys... guys, I need some help!

03:49.474 --> 03:51.465
OK, Oskie. Up...

03:51.885 --> 03:53.346
I can't...

03:55.785 --> 03:57.336
I'm sorry, Felix.

03:59.742 --> 04:01.420
Hello, boys.

04:01.923 --> 04:06.036
Hey guys, wait up!
Where's Felix and Oscar?

04:07.188 --> 04:08.456
Oscar!

04:09.935 --> 04:12.250
We just ran off and left him!
Who does that?

04:14.367 --> 04:15.885
Come on, then.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.858
That was quite an explosion.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.889
How about you explain what that was?

04:25.377 --> 04:27.019
Fireworks.

04:27.020 --> 04:29.287
Fireworks... hmm.

04:29.293 --> 04:33.721
- That huge explosion was fireworks?
- Uh... a sky rocket.

04:33.727 --> 04:37.291
- We know we shouldn't, but...
- I know, I know.

04:37.347 --> 04:41.990
But do you come out here and
let off illegal pyrotechnics often?

04:45.881 --> 04:49.120
- Roland.
- Oh, man... sprung again.

04:49.126 --> 04:51.819
He's fully questioning them!
What do we do?

04:51.846 --> 04:54.590
- Get them out of there?
- Yeah, but how?

04:54.633 --> 04:58.941
Were you playing with fireworks
the day that Andy Lau went missing?

04:59.052 --> 05:02.075
- No.
- What about the Hartley sisters?

05:02.076 --> 05:04.892
- How are they involved?
- Who?

05:06.567 --> 05:09.069
We're gonna play this game, are we?

05:10.176 --> 05:13.587
Something's gotten terribly
out of hand, Felix.

05:13.593 --> 05:17.224
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Tell me what's going on out here, Felix.

05:17.230 --> 05:20.726
What? We've told you everything
we know about Andy.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.044
Where's your wheelchair?

05:25.738 --> 05:27.911
- Not here.
- Oh?

05:28.025 --> 05:30.056
How did he get out here, then?

05:30.654 --> 05:34.683
- Answer my question.
- Felix gave me a piggyback.

05:34.765 --> 05:36.125
Really?

05:36.721 --> 05:38.705
What, all the way from town?

05:41.235 --> 05:44.728
Because I saw him running.
So how do you explain that?

05:44.734 --> 05:47.893
- Must have been someone else.
- Yeah.

05:49.549 --> 05:53.208
Why don't you show us, Oscar?
Show us your running.

05:53.214 --> 05:56.364
- Come on, think!
- We need a distraction.

05:56.421 --> 05:57.886
Like what?

06:01.076 --> 06:04.367
...And I don't know why Felix
is determined to lie to me.

06:07.129 --> 06:10.613
You lie about fireworks, you lie
about your brother walking...

06:11.004 --> 06:14.413
- You don't understand.
- What else are you lying about, Felix?

06:14.988 --> 06:18.047
What has this got to do
with Andy Lau?

06:18.048 --> 06:21.004
Felix...? Felix, I know...

06:21.053 --> 06:23.777
One way or another, Felix!

06:23.945 --> 06:27.415
One way or another...
I will...

06:28.016 --> 06:30.624
- Thanks!
- Thank Sam. We need to get out of here.

06:31.149 --> 06:34.392
I will prove that you're involved!

06:34.754 --> 06:39.076
- Not just a pretty face after all!
- Is it the style or the smile?

06:42.053 --> 06:44.425
Whose power's the best now?

06:46.016 --> 06:49.183
It was you, Felix!
I know it was you!

06:57.886 --> 06:59.787
You're doing that?

07:02.586 --> 07:04.533
It's an elemental thing.

07:05.016 --> 07:06.592
You don't need a spell?

07:06.598 --> 07:08.694
I came home with it
when I crossed universes.

07:08.700 --> 07:13.132
Oh, with a random supernatural power?
You didn't think to tell me?

07:13.138 --> 07:16.073
Well, you and magic
haven't exactly been friends.

07:17.094 --> 07:21.775
This is where Felix's
fireball came from, and the teens...

07:21.781 --> 07:24.321
...All have some kind
of elemental power.

07:28.207 --> 07:31.573
- What if you could, too?
- No, we're not going there again.

07:31.579 --> 07:33.188
It wouldn't be
so dangerous this time.

07:33.189 --> 07:38.404
Ten years ago you cast a spell to get me
magic and you got stuck there... nowhere!

07:38.410 --> 07:40.572
It would be different this time.
I know how to do it.

07:40.578 --> 07:42.785
Can't we just have
a normal, boring life?

07:42.791 --> 07:45.340
No magic, no sudden disappearances?

07:45.346 --> 07:49.377
Tacos and Mexican soda...
Is that what you want?

07:49.383 --> 07:51.354
If I had to choose.

07:51.535 --> 07:55.571
After all these years trying,
you'd say no?

07:57.859 --> 07:59.613
I'm surprised.

08:05.662 --> 08:08.159
I never should have believed Alice.

08:08.514 --> 08:10.517
It's not your fault.
How could you have known?

08:10.541 --> 08:13.826
Not to trust Alice? Pretty sure most
of us could have figured that one out.

08:13.832 --> 08:15.483
I had to make a call.

08:15.489 --> 08:18.096
Every time you make a call,
it's a disaster!

08:18.102 --> 08:21.831
Like you're such a team player, leaving
Oskie and me behind back there!

08:21.837 --> 08:24.449
Hey! Enough arguing!

08:24.580 --> 08:27.063
We need to figure out
what we're gonna do.

08:27.064 --> 08:31.759
- About Alice?
- About Roland. He saw Oscar running.

08:32.015 --> 08:35.446
He's not gonna stop trying
to prove we're responsible.

08:36.054 --> 08:40.679
- If only we could rewind.
- Yeah, erase his hard drive.

08:41.357 --> 08:44.845
Actually... that might work.

08:45.320 --> 08:49.188
- If I combine a couple of spells...
- We could wipe Roland's memory?

08:49.288 --> 08:53.500
With what?
We've got no talisman, remember?

08:57.179 --> 09:01.190
Alice's magic tablet!
She used it on me.

09:01.191 --> 09:05.305
- Yeah, like she's just gonna hand it over.
- Maybe not voluntarily.

09:06.127 --> 09:08.637
Jake, where are you going?

09:08.643 --> 09:12.219
Should we follow him?
What if he takes on Alice alone?

09:12.225 --> 09:14.338
No, we need to get Oscar home.

09:21.693 --> 09:23.943
What was it like where you were?

09:24.438 --> 09:28.356
It was lonely.
Nothing there made sense.

09:28.900 --> 09:32.093
But the magic was strong,
so it made me strong.

09:32.883 --> 09:37.815
- But you were so weak when you got back.
- It didn't want to let me go.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.699
"It"...?

09:42.681 --> 09:44.713
It uses people.

09:46.394 --> 09:48.378
If I said yes...

09:49.861 --> 09:52.154
About the elemental power...

09:53.159 --> 09:55.147
How would it work?

09:59.900 --> 10:01.092
Alice!

10:17.718 --> 10:21.110
Jake's not answering
his phone. I'm worried.

10:21.111 --> 10:24.440
It's OK. Just drop me off,
then you guys go to Phoebe's.

10:29.833 --> 10:30.943
What?

10:35.039 --> 10:37.030
What do you know about twisters?

10:37.706 --> 10:41.123
- Uh... visible funnels of rotating air?
- No, in Bremin.

10:41.335 --> 10:42.980
How common are they?

10:43.206 --> 10:46.188
Uh... not very,
not that I'm aware of.

10:47.576 --> 10:52.543
I want you to pull everything
you can up on Alice Hartley.

10:52.549 --> 10:54.142
Really? Why?

10:54.192 --> 10:57.607
I wanna know how
she's connected to Andy Lau.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.476
Andy Lau?

11:00.659 --> 11:02.396
Can you just do it?

11:04.679 --> 11:06.695
And I'll read it when I get back.

11:08.492 --> 11:09.918
From where?

11:14.476 --> 11:16.296
I know what you did!

11:17.656 --> 11:19.494
What is happening?

11:19.500 --> 11:21.491
Jake, you have to stop this!

11:21.627 --> 11:23.976
- Bring him home.
- Before someone gets hurt!

11:23.992 --> 11:27.215
What you did to Andy and Oscar
and Saskia... you're evil!

11:27.258 --> 11:30.265
She was a golem.
She had a job to do!

11:32.204 --> 11:35.494
- Jake, please!
- You destroyed her.

11:35.500 --> 11:38.399
You made Saskia feel things.
That's what destroyed her.

11:38.405 --> 11:40.605
No, that's not true, it's not!

11:40.830 --> 11:44.465
You did it because she stopped
obeying you - it wasn't me. It was you!

11:44.896 --> 11:46.558
Jake!

11:50.680 --> 11:53.962
- He's here!
- Jake, Jake! We need their help!

11:55.258 --> 11:58.389
- I can't stop!
- You know how. Control the power...

11:59.159 --> 12:01.179
For Andy's sake.

12:10.925 --> 12:12.579
Get him out of here!

12:13.237 --> 12:15.590
- Roland saw the talisman explode.
- Now!

12:15.596 --> 12:18.355
He's been to the hide.
He knows about magic.

12:18.410 --> 12:19.745
Magic...?

12:19.804 --> 12:22.816
- He can't prove anything.
- That's what I said.

12:24.032 --> 12:27.911
- What do you need?
- We need help with a memory-wiping spell.

12:27.937 --> 12:29.206
No, Phoebe!

12:29.349 --> 12:30.609
Guys...

12:33.404 --> 12:37.408
Who, uh... wants to explain this?

12:38.484 --> 12:39.768
Fracking.

12:39.862 --> 12:42.555
A hydraulic means
of extracting shale gas.

12:42.594 --> 12:44.903
Yeah, that's right.

13:02.003 --> 13:04.642
- Fracking.
- Yes, yes.

13:04.648 --> 13:06.804
- Yep. Fracking.
- That's right - fracking.

13:20.607 --> 13:22.936
I know you're all part of this.

13:23.245 --> 13:27.248
And... what exactly is 'this'?

13:27.336 --> 13:29.167
You tell me.

13:30.324 --> 13:35.177
You. You disappear -
and just as suddenly, you reappear.

13:35.183 --> 13:39.511
- My sister's been away backpacking.
- Backpacking.

13:40.004 --> 13:41.698
For ten years?

13:41.699 --> 13:47.863
With no record in the database of ever
exiting or re-entering the country?

13:48.319 --> 13:50.647
Must be a computer glitch.

13:51.647 --> 13:58.560
What I wanna know is your connection
to the disappearance of Andy Lau.

13:58.578 --> 14:01.646
We don't know anything about him.

14:02.346 --> 14:06.170
Long story short,
I think you do.

14:07.133 --> 14:10.124
We've never even met the kid.

14:10.456 --> 14:15.094
How about we go down to the station
and we put that on record?

14:15.162 --> 14:17.850
I think it's time
that we made this official.

14:17.856 --> 14:24.924
Detective, we would be more than happy
to come down to the station -

14:24.930 --> 14:27.655
as soon as we've
spoken to our lawyer.

14:28.558 --> 14:32.513
We'll need a lawyer too,
and an adult advocate.

14:32.519 --> 14:34.350
For each of us.

14:41.121 --> 14:43.598
So the magic tablet
is like the talisman?

14:45.910 --> 14:48.996
I know... freaky.

14:49.924 --> 14:51.476
Felix...

14:51.984 --> 14:55.122
I am so sorry.
I was an idiot to trust Alice.

14:55.128 --> 14:58.419
No, no, I get it.
You wanted to walk again.

14:58.969 --> 15:03.634
- Who wouldn't?
- It's not that. It wasn't about walking.

15:03.860 --> 15:06.898
We've both used magic
to try and change this,

15:07.004 --> 15:10.820
but I just wanted things between us
to be the way they were before.

15:14.431 --> 15:15.647
Like that?

15:16.350 --> 15:18.017
Yeah, pretty much.

15:30.134 --> 15:32.141
So, let me get this straight.

15:32.147 --> 15:35.510
Ley lines are invisible lines
around the world...

15:35.516 --> 15:39.674
- That connect places...
- Of mystical significance, exactly.

15:39.675 --> 15:41.863
What's this got to do with Bremin?

15:41.950 --> 15:46.283
You've marked where the boys
disappeared, where Andy disappeared,

15:46.289 --> 15:48.315
and where these other
disappearances happened.

15:48.321 --> 15:51.081
They all disappeared
along this ley line.

15:51.546 --> 15:54.577
Like the pyramids, or Stonehenge?

15:54.647 --> 15:58.827
"Pyramids, <i>Stone Hedge</i>, Bremin".
I can see that on a T-shirt.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.142
And if the energy
of the ley line is harnessed,

16:01.148 --> 16:04.507
then the psychical magical
happenings are magnified.

16:04.667 --> 16:07.686
You think your brother
disappeared magically?

16:07.687 --> 16:10.384
All the evidence points to that, yes.

16:10.520 --> 16:14.279
Thank you, Vivian.
Do you mind if I hold onto this?

16:14.285 --> 16:16.300
Detective, I don't mean
to be disrespectful...

16:16.306 --> 16:17.747
Then don't be.

16:18.216 --> 16:22.233
- I'll be in touch.
- We have to find him, detective.

16:22.647 --> 16:24.683
I always do.

16:30.787 --> 16:33.750
You're not seriously
considering this, are you?

16:33.908 --> 16:36.463
Always good to look at every angle.

16:43.247 --> 16:45.498
You gave them my tablet.

16:45.659 --> 16:48.627
We can't risk Roland
asking more questions.

16:51.276 --> 16:54.469
And what if the kids
do more than wipe his memory?

16:54.667 --> 16:56.761
You think they can get Andy out?

16:59.325 --> 17:01.133
I'm not sure.

17:01.531 --> 17:04.582
The tablet's not as powerful
as that talisman.

17:04.588 --> 17:08.547
If Felix's spell works,
then we are off the hook.

17:08.643 --> 17:12.438
And if it doesn't, then he's
the one Roland sees trying magic.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.307
So where are <i>we</i> now?

17:19.527 --> 17:21.515
Where we always have been.

17:46.503 --> 17:48.177
Ellen. Hey.

17:52.999 --> 17:55.248
Was I drooling?
I was, wasn't I?

17:55.254 --> 17:58.129
- Afraid so.
- You're not supposed to see that.

17:58.521 --> 18:01.046
- You were up all night?
- Yeah.

18:01.107 --> 18:04.937
Turns out this memory-wiping thing
is more complicated than I thought.

18:05.162 --> 18:09.482
Jake's right, you know - you don't
always have to do this alone.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.875
I made the mess.

18:12.949 --> 18:14.862
I need to fix this.

18:14.882 --> 18:18.603
Maybe you could reinvent the wheel
while you're at it, caveman?

18:22.076 --> 18:25.751
- Sam and Jake are meeting us there, so...
- Yeah, we'd better go.

18:41.504 --> 18:43.791
We need to get Roland alone, OK?

18:43.797 --> 18:47.129
So you two lead him to the bush.
Jake and I will go and prepare the spell.

18:47.135 --> 18:49.901
- What do you need me for?
- You're gonna do the spell.

18:49.997 --> 18:53.107
- Since when?
- If you don't feel up to it...

18:54.136 --> 18:55.823
You're on.

18:56.026 --> 18:58.050
We have to move fast.

19:00.259 --> 19:04.236
- OK, by 'lead him' Felix means...?
- Leave it to me.

19:04.536 --> 19:06.363
I've got this.

19:13.315 --> 19:16.342
I don't see how we'll
get Roland's attention from here.

19:16.348 --> 19:21.528
He's not even gonna see us; you're not
the only one that can do distractions.

19:32.394 --> 19:34.761
Sure you don't need to take a break?

19:34.762 --> 19:38.785
When I'm this close to proving
what really happened to Andy Lau...?

19:39.118 --> 19:40.658
No.

19:41.270 --> 19:45.550
- Can we hurry this up?
- I'm still getting the hang of this, OK?

19:45.782 --> 19:48.151
Oh, grumpy.

20:12.998 --> 20:14.686
Are you getting this?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.572
Getting what?

20:24.721 --> 20:26.086
Detective...?

20:28.439 --> 20:30.659
When you eliminate the impossible,

20:30.711 --> 20:34.658
whatever remains,
no matter how improbable,

20:34.965 --> 20:37.005
must be the truth.

20:38.103 --> 20:40.882
- Where are you going?
- To get the truth.

20:42.810 --> 20:44.774
Do you think it worked?

20:45.433 --> 20:47.130
Here he comes.

20:47.378 --> 20:48.935
Hey!

20:51.666 --> 20:52.838
Oi!

21:05.830 --> 21:09.742
Felix, about yesterday...

21:09.792 --> 21:12.377
- Me being such a...
- Loser?

21:12.874 --> 21:14.526
Don't worry about it.

21:14.791 --> 21:16.781
I just really want Andy back.

21:17.457 --> 21:19.112
It's OK.

21:20.770 --> 21:22.789
I mean, if it was me...

21:23.440 --> 21:26.456
If I had a brother,
I'd do the same thing.

21:27.439 --> 21:28.726
Thanks, mate.

21:39.497 --> 21:41.627
- We're on our way!
- Yep, OK.

21:44.393 --> 21:45.660
They're coming.

21:47.615 --> 21:49.439
You got the spell?

21:50.623 --> 21:52.582
I'm ready if you're ready.

21:53.012 --> 21:56.112
No, Felix, it's cool.
This is your thing.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.368
Do it.

22:00.806 --> 22:02.171
Get ready!

22:02.358 --> 22:03.845
You're sure?

22:08.199 --> 22:09.616
What are you doing?

22:09.662 --> 22:10.877
Go, Jake.

22:10.927 --> 22:12.908
Sam, the circle.

22:13.605 --> 22:16.689
Roland, over here...

22:16.829 --> 22:21.897
Through time and space, altogether,
erase and quell forever.

22:21.903 --> 22:23.489
What on earth is this?

22:23.495 --> 22:28.522
Through time and space, altogether,
erase and quell forever.

22:28.563 --> 22:30.101
Sam, seal the circle!

22:31.228 --> 22:32.908
Not from
the inside, doofus!

22:32.914 --> 22:36.493
Take all thought, transform, renew!

22:36.610 --> 22:41.601
Through time and space altogether,
erase and quell forever.

22:41.607 --> 22:43.330
Sam, get out of the circle!

22:59.802 --> 23:01.160
Did it work?

23:03.388 --> 23:05.411
Only one way to find out.

23:05.762 --> 23:07.601
What are you doing here?

23:11.251 --> 23:12.596
What happened?

23:16.349 --> 23:17.759
Who's that?

23:17.815 --> 23:19.806
Yep, it worked.

23:22.830 --> 23:24.586
His phone.

23:31.806 --> 23:33.782
"Ley lines"...?

23:34.482 --> 23:38.501
Come on, let's get out of here
before he starts asking questions.

23:38.802 --> 23:40.134
Deleted.

23:43.822 --> 23:45.216
Are you OK?

23:45.222 --> 23:47.481
Why didn't you get out
of the circle, mate?

23:47.494 --> 23:48.781
What?

24:01.142 --> 24:02.341
Dudes...

24:05.231 --> 24:07.740
Hey, dudes!

24:16.128 --> 24:18.371
You are so old.

24:19.652 --> 24:22.321
- Roberts.
- Roberts, you have to help me.

24:22.327 --> 24:23.761
- Who is this?
- It's me.

24:23.767 --> 24:27.342
Prank-calling the police station might not
be the smartest thing to do, young man.

24:27.348 --> 24:28.599
There were two necklaces.

24:28.612 --> 24:30.618
- Two versions of you...
- And two Garys.

24:30.624 --> 24:32.635
But Alice doesn't have
a talisman here...

24:32.669 --> 24:35.152
Which means for some reason
she never had it here.

24:35.158 --> 24:36.423
We can still find it!

24:36.429 --> 24:38.785
So according to this,
it's all to do with the ley lines.

24:38.791 --> 24:41.536
The disappearances,
the strange events, the magic...

24:41.561 --> 24:44.155
- What does that mean?
- The lines on the talisman!

24:44.161 --> 24:45.793
They're the same pattern as the ley line.

24:45.799 --> 24:47.631
- Felix!
- Can I ask what you're doing?

24:47.818 --> 24:49.286
Oh, Mrs Ferne...

24:49.292 --> 24:51.302
- Haven't you harass my son enough?
- No.

24:51.308 --> 24:52.433
Do not open your mouth.

24:52.439 --> 24:56.206
Whatever. Just tell Felix he needs
to change us back right now.

24:56.355 --> 24:57.814
You coming?
