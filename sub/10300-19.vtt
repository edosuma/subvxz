01:19.520 --> 01:21.158
How long are we gonna
be gone, Mom?

01:21.360 --> 01:23.590
Oh, until this thing
blows over, honey.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.633
Your father's wrath
is gonna be just terrible.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.558
Come on, Buck, what's keeping you?

01:33.760 --> 01:37.958
I misplaced my dead bird,
if you don't mind.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.393
Look, we can get
another dog on the road.

01:43.920 --> 01:47.071
I just do not wanna be here when
Daddy finds out the awful truth:

01:47.280 --> 01:49.999
That we can no longer
afford a TV Guide.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.752
He just might run amok again.

01:52.960 --> 01:57.556
I think we all remember the great
toilet paper scare of '86.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.553
Where was I?

02:00.760 --> 02:03.035
Well, let's see, '86.

02:03.240 --> 02:05.754
All your friends were
discovering girls, so I believe...

02:05.960 --> 02:08.155
...you were up in your room,
trying to decide...

02:08.360 --> 02:10.112
...which shirt goes
with nothing to do.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.235
You are lucky you weren't here.

02:14.440 --> 02:18.831
The market ran out of Aurora white,
and I had to buy the house brand.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.838
I even put it in
the old Aurora wrapping...

02:22.800 --> 02:25.155
...but he knew at first touch.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.231
God, it was terrible.
Him running around...

02:28.440 --> 02:30.715
...with his pants down
around his ankles...

02:30.920 --> 02:32.956
...screaming to the heavens.

02:33.160 --> 02:36.755
That was the last bridge party
I ever had.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.510
They still talk about
his great doodie strike...

02:40.720 --> 02:42.836
...wherever fine toilet paper is sold.

02:45.280 --> 02:48.078
I hear the sound of a muffler
scraping ground. Dad's home.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.996
What do we do? What do we do?

02:51.200 --> 02:53.509
Just act calm.

02:53.720 --> 02:56.314
I know. We'll put out
an old TV Guide.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.476
Maybe it'll buy us some time.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.238
Maybe we're worried about nothing.

03:00.440 --> 03:03.318
I mean, maybe he'll come home
in a good mood.

03:03.520 --> 03:06.193
Why doesn't the world die?

03:15.360 --> 03:17.476
So far so good.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.959
There was a fire in the mall today.

03:21.160 --> 03:25.312
Twenty stores went up, but guess
where they were able to stop the fire?

03:27.760 --> 03:30.149
Yes, the shoe store.

03:30.360 --> 03:33.352
So I don't get any days off,
but I should be raking it in...

03:33.560 --> 03:37.109
...because it's well known women love
to tromp through burned-out malls...

03:37.320 --> 03:41.438
...just to buy shoes that used to be cats
from a guy that used to be a man.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.357
All I wanna do is curl up on
the couch with a nice TV Guide.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.753
Oh, man, they put
Starsky and Hutch back on the air.

03:54.680 --> 03:57.797
Finally, my letters mean something.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.994
The little dark-haired one got fat.

04:04.240 --> 04:07.038
Oh, man, that's Roseanne.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.233
What madness is this?

04:10.480 --> 04:12.471
Honey, we have
a confession to make.

04:12.680 --> 04:16.593
They raised the cost of heating, and we
can't afford to buy a new TV Guide.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.749
See, he can deal with it.

04:28.960 --> 04:33.476
Honey, it'll be okay. We could steal
a newspaper and use their TV section.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.280
Are you insane? It's not the same.

04:36.480 --> 04:38.630
Does a newspaper fit snugly
in your hands?

04:38.840 --> 04:41.400
Does it jeer? Does it cheer?

04:44.560 --> 04:46.596
Are there articles about
William Conrad...

04:46.800 --> 04:49.997
...and what he'll be doing on
Circus of the Stars? I think not.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.952
Now, look, for years the only
reason we had heat was for the kids.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.388
Now they're both over 18.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.955
I say, let them freeze.
I want my TV Guide.

05:02.600 --> 05:06.036
Al, be reasonable.
It's 79 cents a week.

05:11.320 --> 05:13.629
I'm sorry, honey,
here I thought it was a quarter.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.991
Are you gonna
throw a fit now, sweetie?

05:19.200 --> 05:20.997
Yes, I am.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.630
Well, kick some booty, honey.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.070
How long have we got?

05:26.280 --> 05:30.068
I'd say five, four...
Come on, kids.

05:30.280 --> 05:35.229
Three, two, one.

05:44.440 --> 05:47.796
Oh, mighty one who created
the heavens and the earth...

05:48.760 --> 05:51.718
...and you who
created my wife and kids...

05:52.680 --> 05:54.955
...why doth thou
torment me with a TV...

05:55.160 --> 05:58.357
...but not a TV Guide
to enjoy it with?

06:01.680 --> 06:02.908
I have nothing.

06:03.120 --> 06:05.156
Nothing, nothing.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.999
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

06:09.040 --> 06:11.998
Excuse me, Mr. Woodpecker...

06:12.960 --> 06:15.269
...but have you seen a middle-aged
shoe salesman...

06:15.480 --> 06:17.755
...with no reason to live?

06:17.960 --> 06:19.393
Jefferson, do you have 79 cents?

06:19.640 --> 06:22.359
Why, you paying off the house?

06:25.640 --> 06:29.679
This is for a necessity. Now what do
you say? Do you have 79 cents?

06:30.880 --> 06:34.714
Nope. Nope, nothing
but large-denomination bills.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.229
I did have some quarters
a few hours back...

06:37.440 --> 06:39.954
...but I used them to feed the ducks.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.318
If they eat enough
of them, they sink.

06:46.520 --> 06:47.999
Sometimes I name them first.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.553
- It's good you have a hobby.
- Yeah, well, I have no job.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.955
- You gotta fill the hours, you know.
- Yeah.

06:55.160 --> 06:58.675
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's why I do the shoe thing.

07:01.200 --> 07:04.272
Jefferson, let me ask you something,
how come you always have money?

07:04.480 --> 07:06.914
And I just have a 1972 TV Guide...

07:07.120 --> 07:11.318
...which, if CBS hadn't brought back
All in the Family, wouldn't be any use.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.551
Well, there's no trick to it, Al.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.513
Did you ever see the ad,
"Madam Zelda can make you rich...

07:17.720 --> 07:19.631
...with your personal
lucky numbers"?

07:19.880 --> 07:21.757
Madam Zelda sends
you lucky numbers?

07:22.000 --> 07:25.072
No. I'm Madam Zelda.

07:25.280 --> 07:26.713
I sell the numbers.

07:27.240 --> 07:28.559
- You?
- Yeah.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.955
How can you take money
from unsuspecting people?

07:31.440 --> 07:34.750
I'm a thief. Love me for what I am.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.111
But this is just between us, right?

07:37.680 --> 07:39.557
I'm a squealer.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.429
Love me for what I am.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.478
Or cut me in.

07:54.640 --> 07:58.633
"Mr. Brown, your lucky day
is Wednesday.

08:00.200 --> 08:02.714
Signed, Madam Zelda."

08:04.360 --> 08:06.874
Well, here's this morning's take.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.877
How you doing, Al?

08:09.080 --> 08:13.710
How am I doing?
I got two TV Guides, baby.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.477
Yeah. Got one on the table
and one in the bathroom.

08:18.680 --> 08:23.231
I'm rich. Oh, God, I've arrived.
You know, I just love the feeling...

08:23.440 --> 08:25.795
...of suddenly being able
to provide for my family.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.434
- So you told them?
- Hell, no.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.995
It's just good knowing
I can provide for them.

08:31.200 --> 08:34.351
- What if they find out?
- How? They're morons.

08:34.919 --> 08:37.798
They might suspect something,
but how are they gonna catch me?

08:47.000 --> 08:48.718
Bark, boy.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.315
- AI.
- You know, I may as well admit it...

08:53.520 --> 08:56.159
...I'm the only smart one
in the family.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.112
I mean, we got a woman so lame...

08:58.320 --> 09:00.709
...that she actually thinks
when I groan during sex...

09:00.920 --> 09:02.990
...it has anything to do with her.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.395
And Bud wouldn't know
the house was on fire...

09:07.600 --> 09:09.716
...if it wasn't on Nick at Nite.

09:11.080 --> 09:15.198
And the only reason that Kelly got
a head is to keep rain out of her neck.

09:20.080 --> 09:21.991
Hey.

09:24.880 --> 09:29.158
But they are my family,
and I really should tell them...

09:29.360 --> 09:32.193
...because I do love them...
If only they were home.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.795
All right, Al, can it.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.150
We just have
three simple words for you.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.316
We want in.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.750
What's the third word, Mom?

09:44.240 --> 09:46.435
Take Buck for a walk, honey.

09:46.640 --> 09:49.393
Come on, boy, we're going
for a walkie-walkie.

09:51.560 --> 09:52.879
Now, look here, Al.

09:53.080 --> 09:55.196
When I married you
it was for richer or poorer.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.995
Now I thought we would try one,
then the other, and then choose.

09:59.200 --> 10:02.272
Well, I believe we've gone just about
as far as we can with poor.

10:02.480 --> 10:05.756
So if you think that you are
moving on to rich without me...

10:05.960 --> 10:08.030
Without us.

10:08.680 --> 10:10.636
Without me.

10:11.880 --> 10:16.078
- Then you are cheaper and
stupider than the shoes you sell.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.400
Let me confab with my partner.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.472
No, no, no.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.437
Then they might go tell the cops,
and we could both get in trouble.

10:38.200 --> 10:41.397
Well, you owe me one, honey.
I talked Jefferson into it.

10:42.880 --> 10:45.030
You're in. Actually,
it's a pretty good idea...

10:45.240 --> 10:48.630
...because I'm thinking of expansion.
- What kind of expansion?

10:48.840 --> 10:51.400
The kind of expansion
I'm thinking about will allow me...

10:51.600 --> 10:55.639
...to dress my woman in ermines
and pearls, like she deserves.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.398
And I won't forget you either, Peg.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.512
- Hello.
- Hello.

11:08.920 --> 11:12.913
Madam Zelda Incorporated.
How may the stars help you?

11:13.160 --> 11:16.038
Hello. Lucky days, $2.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.357
Lucky numbers, $5.

11:19.560 --> 11:23.314
Or you can get lucky with me for 50.

11:24.520 --> 11:27.557
Well, let me consult my crystal ball.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.989
It seems that your lucky day
is Thursday.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.430
Your husband died on Thursday?

11:35.640 --> 11:37.870
Gee, I'm better than I thought.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.590
The spirits are about to speak.

11:44.800 --> 11:48.031
Your lucky number is C.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.478
This is better than women, D'Arcy.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.989
I mean, we are bigger
than U.S. Steel.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.519
We are not.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.632
Well, the way the economy's
going we just might be.

12:01.080 --> 12:04.516
I don't like it. We should have kept
it simple. You get in, you get out.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.392
Like sex.

12:07.720 --> 12:08.948
- Yeah.
- You're just mad...

12:09.160 --> 12:11.355
...because my father took
over the operation.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.989
We're making more in a week
than we made in a month.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.395
I'm worried about the attention
we're attracting.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.512
And most of all, I'm worried
about your father. He's changed.

12:19.720 --> 12:22.871
I can't put my finger on it,
but he's different somehow.

12:32.680 --> 12:37.231
Let it be noted the stars say
I'm handsomer than yesterday.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.559
Let's get those phones going.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.991
I want to see lines lit.
I want to see people fleeced.

12:43.200 --> 12:46.875
Come on, my little fortune cookies,
Daddy needs a new pair of everything.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.677
- How we doing?
- Everything's fine, but the West Side.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.188
That's okay.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.551
The West Side is Madam Inga's turf.
And you don't wanna mess with her.

12:56.760 --> 13:00.514
Damn Madam Inga and her army
of psychic Swedes.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.790
I want the West Side,
I'll have the West Side.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.754
I'll have all sides.
Inside, outside, East Side, West Side.

13:06.960 --> 13:10.270
Matter of fact, I'll have a hamburger
with a side of onion rings...

13:10.480 --> 13:12.391
...paid for by
the pensions of old ladies.

13:12.720 --> 13:16.076
Can I get a "whoa, stealing
old ladies' pensions"?

13:17.800 --> 13:21.952
- Whoa, stealing old ladies' pensions.
- Whoa, stealing old ladies' pensions.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.870
I can't believe your father
has called together...

13:29.080 --> 13:31.435
...the heads of Chicago's five
psychic families.

13:34.080 --> 13:38.312
I think the greed has finally
sent him into insanity.

13:39.360 --> 13:43.239
You don't talk about family business
in front of strangers.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.072
My father knows what he's doing.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.391
Silence.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.997
Put your hands together
for the sultan of psychics...

13:55.200 --> 13:58.670
...the king of clairvoyance,
the Pharaoh of fraud.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.189
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's give him a big welcome.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.836
He's my daddy,
Al "Madam Zelda" Bundy.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.389
You are my people.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.670
I'd like to introduce now...

14:22.880 --> 14:25.599
...the king of the Ouija boards
on the South Side:

14:25.800 --> 14:27.358
Big Bob Barruth.

14:28.640 --> 14:31.108
My friends call me Huggie.

14:32.400 --> 14:37.713
And the man who controls the palms on
our North Shore, Zelmo the Toad.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.832
I can kill with my tongue.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.035
And the man who controls
the crystals in the Loop:

14:44.240 --> 14:48.028
- Mad Thursday Markowitz.
- Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.558
And king of the tarots...

14:51.760 --> 14:54.115
...who came all
the way from southern Wisconsin:

14:54.320 --> 14:59.189
- Hakbar the Beast.
- I'll paint any car for $19.95.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.390
And last, but not least...

15:03.600 --> 15:06.876
...although by far
the ugliest and hairiest...

15:07.080 --> 15:10.152
...the virtuoso of the crystal ball:

15:10.360 --> 15:11.873
Madam Inga.

15:12.120 --> 15:16.272
The spirits tell me you
have not bathed today...

15:16.880 --> 15:18.950
...or yesterday.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.794
Please, you could have heard
that anywhere.

15:23.880 --> 15:26.474
Friends and charlatans...

15:26.880 --> 15:31.590
...our city is divided like a pizza
with five different toppings.

15:31.800 --> 15:36.271
The only thing holding it together
in a cohesive unit is the cheese.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.472
- Daddy, the crust too.
- Leave Daddy alone, sweetheart...

15:41.680 --> 15:43.591
...he's kingpinning.

15:43.840 --> 15:46.400
So, what I'm trying to tell you is...

15:46.600 --> 15:48.989
...we shouldn't be fighting
each other like jackals...

15:49.200 --> 15:53.796
...but instead come together
under a benevolent cheese.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.514
I am that cheese.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.834
Oh, Al, the cutest thing
just happened.

16:00.040 --> 16:03.316
And here comes the anchovy
no one wants to touch.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.793
- What is it, Peg?
- Honey, I got the sweetest letter.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.198
This lady that I picked a lucky number
for just won $12 at bingo.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.072
Do you know what this means?

16:14.320 --> 16:18.313
That in a room full of loons
you still manage to stand out?

16:18.720 --> 16:21.792
No. It means I really do have a gift.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.309
Oh, Al, I've been touched.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.676
Certainly not by me.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.677
Now, I am serious, Al.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.758
Give me your palm.
I'll read your future.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.198
Better give me the other one.
That one says nothing.

16:37.360 --> 16:42.514
So what I'd like to do is form a lean,
mean psychic machine...

16:42.760 --> 16:45.399
...with me as your leader
for a mere 50 percent.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.512
- Are you with me?
- This is ridiculous.

16:48.720 --> 16:52.998
I share nothing with you,
you psychic-less shoe salesman.

16:53.200 --> 16:56.158
My gift is real, and so is my curse.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.548
Oh, help me.

16:58.760 --> 17:01.513
Save me, Peg, before the hairs
on her very lip reach out...

17:01.720 --> 17:04.439
...and strangle me like
the mighty octopus.

17:05.160 --> 17:07.469
I'll ask my spirits what to do.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.590
You do that, baby.

17:10.400 --> 17:14.393
In the meantime, Inga,
baby, doll, crone...

17:15.160 --> 17:18.152
...now, this is not an order,
but a mere suggestion.

17:18.359 --> 17:22.239
If you don't want in,
then you're free to leave.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.676
Inga...

17:27.520 --> 17:29.636
...you forgot something.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.910
It slipped.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.911
You will pay for busting my ball.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.635
May you...

17:47.840 --> 17:49.717
It's too late.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.791
May your wife...

17:53.400 --> 17:55.311
No sense in that.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.838
May your children...

18:04.320 --> 18:09.394
Oh, well, I'll think of something.
But cursed you shall be. This I vow.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.475
Anyone else want out?

18:17.280 --> 18:19.510
Good, then it's settled.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.472
Kelly.

18:33.760 --> 18:35.398
It's rolling in.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.511
Curse, my heinie.

18:38.280 --> 18:42.478
Can you imagine people in this day and
age still believe that mumbo jumbo.

18:52.960 --> 18:56.191
You know, after I milk Chicago dry,
I'm thinking about heading west.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.472
Yeah, where all a guy needs is guts
and a bad Hungarian accent...

18:59.680 --> 19:01.796
...to fleece the beautiful people.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.958
Al, I'm scared.

19:04.160 --> 19:07.232
You are meddling with powers
which, much like a woman's body...

19:07.440 --> 19:09.749
...you don't understand.

19:10.320 --> 19:11.912
Madam Inga is real.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.270
Didn't you feel her power
when she walked by?

19:14.680 --> 19:16.318
Peg, the only power I sensed...

19:16.520 --> 19:19.990
...was that of the mighty forces
unleashed by beans.

19:27.240 --> 19:31.392
But, Daddy, what if her powers are real?
What if she turns one of us into a frog?

19:39.760 --> 19:41.796
You're laughing now.
Let's see how you feel...

19:42.000 --> 19:45.595
...when you've been turned
into a thick-thighed waitress.

19:46.840 --> 19:48.751
And that's just the curse of time.

19:48.960 --> 19:51.758
Wait till Madam Inga's
through with you.

19:53.080 --> 19:56.709
They're magically delicious.
They're magically delicious.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.073
Al.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.232
Al, word's out on the street.

20:02.440 --> 20:06.035
Madam Inga has called together all the
dark forces of Sweden against you.

20:07.080 --> 20:10.595
What's gonna happen? I wake up
one morning owning a Volvo?

20:12.320 --> 20:14.788
Spend the rest of my life as a skier?

20:15.000 --> 20:16.433
Or worse, wake up one morning...

20:16.640 --> 20:19.200
...next to a long-legged Nordic
beauty with big honkers?

20:19.400 --> 20:21.118
Oh, no.

20:21.960 --> 20:25.157
Yeah, well, I'm pulling out because
anyone around you is gonna get it.

20:25.400 --> 20:29.029
We're all gonna walk the Earth
forever as undead masseuses.

20:29.240 --> 20:30.753
Thank your father, kids.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.996
- Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks, Dad.

20:33.880 --> 20:36.269
Now, what's wrong with you people?

20:36.480 --> 20:38.277
How many times do you
come whining to me:

20:38.480 --> 20:40.391
"Why can't we have a summer home?

20:40.600 --> 20:44.912
Why can't we have a boat?
Why can't we have heat like cavemen?"

20:45.560 --> 20:48.393
Well, now that you're up to your
little heinies in TV Guides...

20:48.600 --> 20:50.875
...and I'm bringing home the bacon,
what do I hear?

20:51.080 --> 20:54.755
"Somebody put a curse on us.
Let's blame Daddy."

20:54.960 --> 20:57.315
Well, there's no
such thing as curses.

20:57.520 --> 21:00.193
This is the 20th century, people.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.868
There's no such thing as curses.

21:26.320 --> 21:29.756
Well, Al, once again
you've enriched our lives.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.393
Thank your father, kids.

21:31.800 --> 21:34.075
- Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks, Dad.

21:35.360 --> 21:39.956
Hey, we sent Inga all our money,
against my wishes, by the way.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.752
And the curse should be lifted soon.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.952
Lf, in fact, there is
such a thing as a curse.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.994
Dad, what if she never got the money?

21:49.400 --> 21:52.198
Buck has never let us down before.
He won't let us down now.

21:53.800 --> 21:55.392
Here he comes now.

22:01.520 --> 22:02.589
How you doing, Buck?

22:02.800 --> 22:04.438
Did you send the money, boy?

22:04.680 --> 22:08.036
Well, I had to use it for bail.
No one bothered to tell me...

22:08.240 --> 22:12.677
...that when humans meet a girl, it's
considered impolite to sniff her butt.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.631
Damn dog.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.552
Well, I guess we're monkeys.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.876
Yeah, big difference.
