<i>Previously on
"once upon a time"...</i>

00:03.703 --> 00:05.137
What you have is a gift.

00:05.139 --> 00:06.939
I wanted to use my magic
to help someone for so long.

00:06.941 --> 00:10.042
You're still trying to fill the
hole in your heart I created.

00:10.044 --> 00:11.043
You can't stop me.

00:11.045 --> 00:12.111
I'm not here to stop you.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.445
I'm here to do it for you.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.614
Now you are mine.

00:17.884 --> 00:19.151
Hello, rumple.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.486
How did you get here?

00:20.488 --> 00:23.188
If you don't do what I'm asking,
the savior will die.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.190
This is the only hope
the savior has of defeating her.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.493
What happens
at the end of the book?

00:27.495 --> 00:29.328
The savior fights
the final battle.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.530
No one wants to be around
to see that.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.684
Excuse me, but your tree
is blocking the path.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.054
You should move it before
somebody gets hurt.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.723
I'm afraid
it's already too late.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.325
The poor thing.

01:00.327 --> 01:02.127
It must not have
survived the fall.

01:06.499 --> 01:07.633
How did you do that?

01:13.873 --> 01:15.741
Magic.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.009
Are you a witch?

01:18.545 --> 01:20.712
She's a freak!

01:20.714 --> 01:23.048
Haven't you ever heard
about the monster

01:23.050 --> 01:27.886
who lives in the shack...
The freak with magic?

01:27.888 --> 01:29.555
That nest didn't fall out
of the tree, did it?

01:29.557 --> 01:30.889
No.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.891
It made good target practice,
though.

01:32.893 --> 01:35.461
And so will you.

01:37.063 --> 01:38.630
Why don't you practice on my ax?

01:45.872 --> 01:46.939
Are you all right?

01:46.941 --> 01:49.975
Yes. Thank you.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.313
Well, that was a first.

01:54.315 --> 01:58.217
Not a lot of people want
to befriend the girl with magic.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.552
Maybe they're right.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.488
<i>Maybe I am a monster.</i>

02:02.490 --> 02:04.156
You used your magic for good,

02:04.158 --> 02:05.757
and that doesn't make
you a monster.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.493
It makes you special.

02:09.628 --> 02:11.563
You really think so?

02:11.565 --> 02:14.433
I'm stanum.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.734
Zelena.

02:18.838 --> 02:20.172
Hang on a minute, darling.

02:20.174 --> 02:21.974
Mommy's coming.

02:21.976 --> 02:24.476
I'm going as fast as I can.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.311
There.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.747
Not too hot and not too cold...
Just right.

02:30.017 --> 02:33.685
Is somebody ready
for their breakfast?

02:33.687 --> 02:36.121
Robin?

02:36.123 --> 02:38.257
Keeping a watchful eye
on an infant

02:38.259 --> 02:41.160
can be so hard all by yourself.

02:41.162 --> 02:42.694
But worry not.

02:42.696 --> 02:47.366
I have plenty of experience,
and I am happy to help.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.600
Give me back my daughter.

02:48.602 --> 02:51.870
Can't I hold
her a little longer?

02:51.872 --> 02:54.606
I never grow tired
of that new-baby smell.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.775
Lay a hand on her again,
and you'll lose it.

02:56.777 --> 03:01.547
No need to be so hostile,
especially around the child.

03:04.150 --> 03:06.318
I came here because
I heard you were wicked,

03:06.320 --> 03:08.387
and I thought
we could help each other.

03:10.124 --> 03:11.456
Why would I help you?

03:11.458 --> 03:13.392
Isn't it obvious?

03:13.394 --> 03:15.394
Look around.

03:15.396 --> 03:19.464
You're out here, living alone
in the middle of nowhere.

03:19.466 --> 03:22.401
You look like
you could use a friend,

03:22.403 --> 03:25.737
especially with
the final battle approaching.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.639
I could be that friend.

03:27.641 --> 03:32.411
One wouldn't want to be alone
for what's coming.

03:32.413 --> 03:35.581
Is that a threat?

03:35.583 --> 03:37.583
Because I'm not afraid of you.

03:37.585 --> 03:42.154
But you should be.

03:42.156 --> 03:44.256
You most certainly should be.

03:47.595 --> 03:50.896
I'll be in the dwarf tunnels
if you change your mind.

03:50.898 --> 03:51.997
Until then.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.625
Something smells delicious.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.059
It's just from a box.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.428
I'm not talking
about the pancakes.

04:33.873 --> 04:35.307
What?

04:35.309 --> 04:38.076
I'm just... Happy.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.212
It still surprises me sometimes.

04:40.214 --> 04:41.780
Aye, luv. Me, too.

04:50.723 --> 04:51.823
To hell with the pancakes.

04:56.396 --> 04:58.497
Great. You're up.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.165
Mom...

05:00.167 --> 05:02.134
Your mother has a key.
Good to know.

05:02.136 --> 05:03.735
I know I'm a little early,
but I woke up this morning,

05:03.737 --> 05:04.737
and it just hit me.

05:06.839 --> 05:07.906
Am I interrupting something?

05:07.908 --> 05:09.308
Yes. No.

05:09.310 --> 05:12.511
We were, - we were
just making some pancakes.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.512
Pancakes.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.113
Right.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.249
Maybe I should come back
after you've had... Pancakes.

05:17.251 --> 05:18.350
Um... Don't worry.

05:18.352 --> 05:19.651
I've lost my appetite.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.321
I have to go and have
a quick and bracing shower.

05:25.191 --> 05:29.094
Mom, as much as I love
our unexpected visits,

05:29.096 --> 05:32.030
is there something
pressing today?

05:32.032 --> 05:34.933
Wedding planning.

05:34.935 --> 05:38.270
Um, I have been putting
together a few ideas.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.842
You did all this
since hook and I got engaged?

05:43.844 --> 05:45.644
I might have started
a bit before that.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.512
Like, how long ago?

05:47.514 --> 05:51.049
Um, well, it was definitely
after the first curse.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.884
Look, I know I'm excited,
but can you blame me?

05:52.886 --> 05:54.553
I have missed a lot

05:54.555 --> 05:55.987
of the milestones
in your life, Emma.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.856
I want to make
the absolute most of this one.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.161
Me, too, mom.

06:08.402 --> 06:11.470
Regina, what's up?

06:11.472 --> 06:12.671
We'll be right there.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.740
I was about to wring
her scrawny little neck,

06:14.742 --> 06:16.341
and then she just poofed away.

06:16.343 --> 06:17.876
Makes sense she's headed
to the dwarf tunnels.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.344
It's an easy place to hide.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.213
And there are miles of them
below storybrooke.

06:21.215 --> 06:22.714
Pinning her down
in there won't be easy.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.883
Well, the good news is,
whatever her plan was

06:24.885 --> 06:27.753
for the final battle,
she needs help.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.489
Which means we have time to
figure out how to stop her.

06:30.491 --> 06:33.091
Well, perhaps that's where
this piece of wand comes in.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.593
Tiger Lily said it had been used

06:34.595 --> 06:36.528
to banish the black fairy once.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.430
If we can find the other half,
perhaps we can do it again.

06:38.432 --> 06:39.998
So, where do we look?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.767
I'm not waiting around
for some piece of wand.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.102
The only reason I didn't blast
that noir-colored nit

06:44.104 --> 06:46.204
out of existence
is because of Robin.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.706
So, if one of you'd be kind
enough to watch her

06:47.708 --> 06:49.408
for a minute,
I'll do what I intended

06:49.410 --> 06:50.609
and go and take care of this.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.344
Well, hold on. You can't just

06:52.346 --> 06:54.546
go down there alone
and confront her.

06:54.548 --> 06:55.881
Why not?

06:55.883 --> 06:57.349
What, you think
I can't defeat her?

06:57.351 --> 06:58.583
I'm more powerful than you.

06:58.585 --> 06:59.951
Really?

06:59.953 --> 07:01.853
Is that why I had
to rip out my own heart

07:01.855 --> 07:03.255
<i>to save you from the evil queen?</i>

07:03.257 --> 07:05.123
Look, I would have been fine
without your help.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.958
Believe what you want.
You're not going down there.

07:06.960 --> 07:11.196
Okay, sibling rivalry aside,
Regina's right.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.398
We need to get the wand back
before we go up against her,

07:13.400 --> 07:15.934
and when we do,
we're going to do this together.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.202
Thank you.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.603
Okay, fine. Have it your way,

07:18.605 --> 07:20.472
but you're doing it without me.

07:23.209 --> 07:24.876
She gonna be okay?

07:24.878 --> 07:26.278
Yeah. She just needs
to cool off.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.046
In the meantime, why don't I

07:28.048 --> 07:30.215
take that piece of wand
back to my vault,

07:30.217 --> 07:32.317
see if I can cast
a locator spell on it.

07:32.319 --> 07:33.385
What about us?
I mean, we can't just

07:33.387 --> 07:34.586
sit around here doing nothing.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.620
Well, we won't be.

07:35.622 --> 07:36.721
We have plenty to do
to keep us busy.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.256
We do?

07:38.258 --> 07:39.825
<i>Well, you've obviously
never planned a wedding.</i>

07:39.827 --> 07:42.093
You really want
to pick out centerpieces

07:42.095 --> 07:43.495
on the Eve of the final battle?

07:43.497 --> 07:44.963
I do.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.131
David and I went through
with our wedding

07:46.133 --> 07:47.766
after you threatened us.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.768
It gave people hope.

07:49.770 --> 07:53.505
Why should Emma and hook's
be any different?

07:53.507 --> 07:54.840
So, who's ready
to put their hearts

07:54.842 --> 07:57.175
into some wedding planning?

08:00.112 --> 08:03.315
The black fairy
has Gideon's heart?

08:03.317 --> 08:05.083
I knew it.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.485
I knew our son
couldn't do those things.

08:06.487 --> 08:09.788
I knew he wasn't evil.

08:11.458 --> 08:15.760
You know,
this means he can be saved.

08:15.762 --> 08:20.298
The blue fairy is even older
than me, belle.

08:20.300 --> 08:24.769
She knew my mother
before she became evil.

08:24.771 --> 08:28.206
Which means that blue could have
the answer to stopping her.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.708
And I played right
into my mother's hands

08:29.710 --> 08:31.443
and took her magic.

08:31.445 --> 08:33.278
Now I can't wake her,

08:33.280 --> 08:35.780
which means,
if she does know anything,

08:35.782 --> 08:37.215
right now, she's useless.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.851
Yeah, but you
couldn't have known

08:39.852 --> 08:43.020
that your mother was pulling
all the strings, rumple.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.157
You did what you had to,
to protect Gideon.

08:46.159 --> 08:49.628
Now, we just have to find a way
to get blue out of her coma.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.963
Yeah, well, the first step
is returning her magic.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.566
Her heart remains frozen
till then.

08:54.568 --> 08:57.402
Well, any idea how?

08:57.404 --> 09:01.973
No, and I'm afraid that I've
exhausted all my books here.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.242
I'm gonna go to
the sorcerer's mansion,

09:04.244 --> 09:06.378
see what I can find. Okay.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.079
Good luck.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.155
Okay.

09:21.260 --> 09:22.861
Rumple?

09:22.863 --> 09:26.331
No. It's me.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.866
I had to wait until he left.

09:27.868 --> 09:31.069
Zelena.

09:31.071 --> 09:34.072
Well, what do we have here?

09:34.074 --> 09:35.340
Is she... n-no.

09:35.342 --> 09:38.677
Her heart's stopped
because her magic's gone.

09:38.679 --> 09:39.578
Rumple's taking care of it.

09:39.580 --> 09:40.845
Is he now?

09:40.847 --> 09:42.180
Well, I never liked her anyway.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.882
Your secret's safe with me.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.617
Okay. Good to know.

09:45.619 --> 09:48.720
Why are you here?

09:48.722 --> 09:50.555
I need a favor.

09:50.557 --> 09:53.224
I was wondering if
you could watch Robin for me.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.293
Yeah, yeah, of... of course.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.596
I'd be happy to.

09:57.598 --> 10:01.066
I, - I think we've got
a bassinet we could use.

10:01.068 --> 10:03.034
Come on.

10:07.807 --> 10:10.375
There you go.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.776
Don't worry, darling.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.245
Mommy won't be gone long.

10:14.247 --> 10:18.216
She just has to go and pluck
that big, bad fairy's wings.

10:39.572 --> 10:40.905
Hello?

10:54.453 --> 10:56.021
Henry.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.022
Henry!

10:57.024 --> 10:58.089
Grandpa.

11:00.626 --> 11:03.161
Didn't you hear me?

11:03.163 --> 11:04.596
Sorry. I was writing.

11:04.598 --> 11:05.764
That's your author's pen.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.969
Henry, I know there's been
a lot going on lately,

11:10.971 --> 11:12.937
but please tell me you
haven't tried to change things.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.305
You know how dangerous
that can be.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.775
Of course not.
I know better than that.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.443
Good.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.512
Also, I already tried
a few days ago,

11:20.514 --> 11:21.880
and it didn't work.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.014
Look.

11:28.821 --> 11:31.189
See?

11:31.191 --> 11:33.992
I couldn't change things
even if I wanted to.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.727
She has to fight
in the final battle.

11:35.729 --> 11:38.329
There's no escaping it.

11:38.331 --> 11:42.634
<i>Okay. So, what are you doing?</i>

11:42.636 --> 11:44.736
Trying to translate this.

11:44.738 --> 11:47.338
That's the page you made
in Regina's vault.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.075
Isaac said the author's powers
are trying to tell me something.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.309
I thought maybe
they came out like that

11:51.311 --> 11:53.478
because I was using
a regular pen.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.380
But this one's
not working any better.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.648
What's the point
of having these powers

11:56.650 --> 11:58.550
when I can't use them
to help anyone?

11:58.552 --> 11:59.884
We're going to help her, Henry,

11:59.886 --> 12:03.555
but we can't drive ourselves
crazy while we're doing it.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.757
You know, sometimes the best
thing you can do is step away.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.358
Step away?

12:07.360 --> 12:11.663
Yeah. You know, live life,
which is why I came back here.

12:11.665 --> 12:14.432
I forgot my wallet,
and I'm probably gonna need it.

12:14.434 --> 12:17.702
We're looking
at wedding venues today.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.671
Wedding venues?

12:19.673 --> 12:20.772
Living our life?

12:20.774 --> 12:22.741
This reeks of grandma...

12:22.743 --> 12:24.843
Not giving up hope
and all that stuff.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.444
She's usually right
about these things.

12:26.446 --> 12:27.746
Now, come on. Leave this here.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.280
You can come back
for it all later.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.464
Regina!

12:46.466 --> 12:48.533
Hi. What, -
what can I help you with?

12:48.535 --> 12:50.201
Well, I was putting together
a locator spell

12:50.203 --> 12:53.271
when I realize I was out
of eye of n...

12:53.273 --> 12:54.906
Is that Robin?

12:54.908 --> 12:56.708
Yeah. Zelena asked me
to watch her for a bit.

12:56.710 --> 12:58.810
Isn't she adorable?

12:59.913 --> 13:03.148
Is something wrong?

13:03.150 --> 13:06.584
Not right now.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.620
But there's about to be.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.210
The salt, please.

13:36.348 --> 13:37.682
Your wickedness,

13:37.684 --> 13:38.917
there's a man here to see you.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.285
He says he needs help.

13:41.922 --> 13:45.123
Don't people remember I exiled
that charlatan wizard ages ago?

13:45.125 --> 13:48.459
Maybe it's time I did
something to remind them.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.861
Well, send him in.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.035
Hello, zelena.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.838
It's good to see you again.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.706
Do I know you?

14:01.708 --> 14:05.643
Perhaps you'd know me better if
I were holding a bird's nest.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.445
Stanum.

14:07.447 --> 14:10.315
It's been a long time.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.951
And I see I'm not
the only one who's changed.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.386
What are you doing here?

14:15.388 --> 14:17.889
I was hoping you'd help
an old friend.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.123
I chopped down a tree

14:19.125 --> 14:20.992
belonging to
the wicked witch of the north,

14:20.994 --> 14:24.562
and she punished me
by giving me a terrible curse.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.130
What?

14:26.132 --> 14:27.866
She turned your clothes to tin?

14:27.868 --> 14:29.868
That's just it.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.502
It's not just my clothes.

14:31.504 --> 14:34.038
It's me. And it's spreading.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.807
And unless I find
a new heart soon,

14:35.809 --> 14:37.342
there won't be any of me left.

14:37.344 --> 14:40.912
You'll be a walking tin can.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.550
Well, what am I supposed to do
about any of this?

14:45.552 --> 14:48.186
There's an enchanted object...
The crimson heart.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.754
It's said to be hidden
in the woods,

14:49.756 --> 14:51.923
and there's a horrible monster
that guards it.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.758
I need your help to get it.

14:53.760 --> 14:57.395
So, you get a heart.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.198
What do I get out of
this little arrangement?

15:00.200 --> 15:02.333
Whatever happened to you using
your magic for good?

15:02.335 --> 15:04.602
Well, it's as you said.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.838
I've changed.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.674
And using magic to be wicked
is a lot more fun.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.210
That may be, but
I don't think being wicked

15:12.212 --> 15:14.579
is the reason
you're not helping me.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.015
You act powerful,

15:17.017 --> 15:18.549
but I think
you're really afraid.

15:18.551 --> 15:22.253
How dare you
talk to me like that.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.889
Do you know who I am,
what I can do?

15:24.891 --> 15:30.094
Yes. I just don't have much
to lose anymore.

15:30.096 --> 15:33.031
Hope you enjoy
having dinner by yourself.

15:37.069 --> 15:38.169
Guards!

15:40.973 --> 15:44.042
I'm not afraid of some monster
in the woods.

15:44.044 --> 15:48.713
I'm the most powerful witch
in all of oz.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.115
Now let's get that heart,
and I'll prove it.

16:13.239 --> 16:14.339
Zelena.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.674
Regina, what are
you doing down here?

16:16.676 --> 16:19.243
Isn't it obvious?
I came to get you out of here

16:19.245 --> 16:20.445
before you get yourself killed.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.846
I'm not going anywhere.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.247
Just get out of my way.

16:23.249 --> 16:25.283
It's for your own good.

16:25.285 --> 16:28.353
<i>So... so now
you care about my own good?</i>

16:28.355 --> 16:30.321
You're not gonna blame me
for something?

16:30.323 --> 16:31.756
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

16:31.758 --> 16:34.692
It means that in all
your sobbing over Robin's death

16:34.694 --> 16:38.262
and your broken heart,
all you did was blame me.

16:38.264 --> 16:41.332
I sacrificed Hades for you,

16:41.334 --> 16:43.601
the man I loved,
to save your life.

16:43.603 --> 16:46.371
And in return, I get blamed.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.006
And now you're here
to lecture me?

16:48.008 --> 16:49.640
No, thanks.

16:49.642 --> 16:52.977
I'm not welcome at
the hero's table? Fine.

16:52.979 --> 16:54.345
I'll just take care
of this by myself.

16:54.347 --> 16:58.316
Zelena... sis, please.

16:58.318 --> 16:59.784
I've got work to do.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.386
No. Get off me!

17:07.059 --> 17:08.219
You shouldn't have done that.

17:22.808 --> 17:24.642
- So, what do you think?
- It's nice.

17:24.644 --> 17:28.246
I still think we could consider
getting married on the sea.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.714
Wouldn't it be romantic
to exchange our vows

17:29.716 --> 17:31.315
<i>on the jolly Roger?</i>

17:31.317 --> 17:35.086
Not if half your guests are
getting sick over the side.

17:35.088 --> 17:36.487
I guess the lad has a point.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.256
I think granny's
will be perfect.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.091
We can have
the ceremony outside.

17:40.093 --> 17:43.661
After dinner, we push
the tables aside for dancing.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.163
There's music on the jukebox.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.898
What do you think, David?

17:48.868 --> 17:51.002
I don't know.

17:51.004 --> 17:52.236
What do you mean,
you don't know?

17:52.238 --> 17:54.038
We have shared so many
happy memories here together.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.373
Don't you want to have one more?

17:55.375 --> 17:57.008
Let's be honest.

17:57.010 --> 17:58.342
Not all of them have been happy,

17:58.344 --> 18:01.846
and not all of them
have been together, either.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.247
What are you talking about?

18:03.249 --> 18:05.016
For starters, how about
your first date with whale?

18:05.018 --> 18:06.617
Ouch. Dad!

18:06.619 --> 18:07.685
We were cursed.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.887
Are you really bringing
that up right now?

18:09.889 --> 18:11.422
That can't possibly
be the reason

18:11.424 --> 18:12.623
you don't want
to have Emma's wedding here.

18:12.625 --> 18:13.624
Okay, well, how about this?

18:13.626 --> 18:15.293
This place is a scrap heap.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.928
You want another one?
It's not big enough.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.697
Emma's a Princess, and
her wedding is a royal affair.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.467
You want to find
someplace bigger, fine.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.135
Let's go find one.

18:24.137 --> 18:25.203
Happy to.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.542
What's going on?

18:31.544 --> 18:32.643
I don't know, luv.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.846
I don't know at all.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.489
This is exactly why I told you
not to come down here.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.458
Are you implying
that this is my fault?

18:47.460 --> 18:50.828
I'm not implying anything.
I'm saying it.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.130
If you had just listened to me,

18:52.132 --> 18:54.298
we wouldn't be trapped
a half a mile under storybrooke.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.134
And if you hadn't
crashed my party,

18:56.136 --> 18:58.436
I'd be wiping the mine floor
with the black fairy by now.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.638
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.007
She's the most powerful evil
we've ever faced.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.510
Which is why I was launching
a sneak attack.

19:05.512 --> 19:08.012
Yeah, without the one weapon
we know can defeat her.

19:08.014 --> 19:10.248
<i>You may need a fairy wand.</i>

19:10.250 --> 19:12.316
Emma may need a fairy wand.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.417
I don't.

19:13.419 --> 19:15.253
Is that what this is about...

19:15.255 --> 19:17.355
You proving you're better
than all of us?

19:17.357 --> 19:19.090
No.

19:19.092 --> 19:20.825
It's about stopping the woman
who threatened my baby.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.427
Yeah. On your own.

19:23.429 --> 19:26.664
Why does it matter
so much, zelena?

19:26.666 --> 19:29.934
Why do you have to be better
than everyone else?

19:31.803 --> 19:33.638
Because I am.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.773
Now, I'm going
to find the black fairy

19:35.775 --> 19:38.042
and destroy her
before she finds us.

19:38.044 --> 19:39.377
So, unless you want
the rest of these mines

19:39.379 --> 19:42.713
to come crashing down on top
of us, don't try to stop me.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.282
Zelena...

19:53.792 --> 19:56.060
We must be near
the monster's den.

19:56.062 --> 19:58.162
Well, then let's get on with it.

19:58.164 --> 19:59.664
There's a village
full of munchkins

19:59.666 --> 20:03.301
I still need
to terrorize tonight.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.969
You know, it's just
the two of us, zelena.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.370
You don't have
to pretend anymore.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.805
Pretend what?

20:07.807 --> 20:10.208
That you'd rather be doing
something else.

20:10.210 --> 20:13.077
All right, stanum, tell me...
Why am I out here helping you?

20:13.079 --> 20:15.746
Because you have
nothing better to do.

20:15.748 --> 20:19.150
And you'd rather be out
in the woods with an old friend

20:19.152 --> 20:21.852
than sitting alone in
that emerald castle of yours.

20:23.189 --> 20:25.323
That couldn't be further
from the truth.

20:25.325 --> 20:28.326
I've got lots of important work
to do back at my chambers.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.594
Such as?

20:29.596 --> 20:33.598
Creating one of the most
powerful spells ever to exist,

20:33.600 --> 20:35.933
one that will allow me
to travel back in time.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.202
And where exactly
do you plan on going

20:38.204 --> 20:40.438
with this time-travel spell?

20:40.440 --> 20:44.275
Back to the beginning,
to when my mother gave me up,

20:44.277 --> 20:46.510
to show her I'm more powerful
than my sister,

20:46.512 --> 20:50.281
<i>that I'm the one
she should have kept.</i>

20:50.283 --> 20:52.283
Seems like you're going to
an awful lot of trouble

20:52.285 --> 20:55.086
to be with someone who didn't
want you to begin with.

20:55.088 --> 20:56.354
Careful.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.256
The last person
to speak so freely to me

20:58.258 --> 21:00.224
is now peeling bananas
with their feet.

21:00.226 --> 21:02.260
Yeah.

21:02.262 --> 21:03.928
Well, you wouldn't be so upset

21:03.930 --> 21:07.531
unless what I was saying
was true.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.800
Do you have a better idea of how
I can get what I want?

21:09.802 --> 21:12.703
As a matter of fact, I do.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.276
No.

21:20.380 --> 21:23.047
I'm the only one who
hurts people in these woods.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.252
Zelena!

21:28.254 --> 21:30.154
I told you...
You're not stopping me.

21:32.457 --> 21:33.457
Wait.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.558
What?

21:37.596 --> 21:39.830
Fairy crystals...

21:39.832 --> 21:41.732
And it's just
the beginning of a vein.

21:46.571 --> 21:48.406
Well, at least now we know why

21:48.408 --> 21:50.408
the black fairy's
holed up down here.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.143
What would she want
with all that light magic?

21:52.145 --> 21:54.345
That's the thing.

21:54.347 --> 21:58.582
I'm not interested
in light magic.

21:58.584 --> 22:03.454
So, you're the big, bad
evil queen who cast my curse.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.690
No wonder it was such
a pathetic failure.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.124
Is that so?

22:07.126 --> 22:08.126
Gideon.

22:15.934 --> 22:18.636
So, does this mean you're here
to take me up on my offer then?

22:18.638 --> 22:19.870
Afraid not.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.472
See, I'm stronger
than my sister,

22:21.474 --> 22:24.675
and I came down here to do
one thing... kill you.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.143
Not today.

22:32.150 --> 22:34.118
You keep him busy.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.920
She messed with the wrong witch.

23:06.485 --> 23:08.386
You can't run forever.

23:08.388 --> 23:12.256
I don't have to.

23:12.258 --> 23:14.158
You should have
taken me up on my offer

23:14.160 --> 23:15.326
when you had the chance.

23:15.328 --> 23:16.394
Why?

23:19.564 --> 23:21.532
Don't you know?

23:21.534 --> 23:24.268
Wicked always wins.

23:24.270 --> 23:27.938
And now I'm going to end you
once and for all.

23:37.450 --> 23:40.551
The saddest part is

23:40.553 --> 23:44.088
you really believe
that you can do that.

23:47.560 --> 23:52.096
Now, you want to see real magic?

23:58.470 --> 23:59.703
No!

24:02.607 --> 24:04.241
Zelena.

24:04.243 --> 24:07.778
You played your part well,
my son.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.780
That's impossible.
What's the matter?

24:09.782 --> 24:11.949
Not as strong as
you thought, dear?

24:14.086 --> 24:15.386
Let her go.

24:17.889 --> 24:20.558
You were right about one thing.

24:20.560 --> 24:25.095
You are stronger
than your sister.

24:25.097 --> 24:28.065
Which is why I needed
to channel your magic

24:28.067 --> 24:30.768
to weaponize these crystals.

24:30.770 --> 24:34.238
But with a dose of dark magic...
Your dark magic...

24:34.240 --> 24:36.640
They can be, so much more.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.008
My magic?

24:38.010 --> 24:39.944
What about yours?

24:39.946 --> 24:42.947
Darling, don't you see?

24:42.949 --> 24:45.749
Your magic is useful
because it's unstable.

24:45.751 --> 24:48.619
You're so desperate for love,
so desperate to prove yourself.

24:48.621 --> 24:51.489
Your heart is in disarray.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.658
Well, don't look so surprised.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.327
Anyone can see it.

24:56.329 --> 25:02.032
I, on the other hand,
am quite pleased with myself.

25:07.473 --> 25:09.540
You set me up.

25:09.542 --> 25:10.674
No.

25:10.676 --> 25:14.345
I just knew you'd make
the wrong decision.

25:14.347 --> 25:16.280
What are you going to do
with all of this?

25:16.282 --> 25:21.151
What I came here for...
Start the final battle.

25:21.153 --> 25:23.120
But worry not.

25:23.122 --> 25:26.957
You won't be around to regret
your mistake much longer.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.726
No one will.

25:31.863 --> 25:32.897
Unh!

25:54.219 --> 25:56.086
These are my woods,

25:56.088 --> 25:57.221
so I think it's time you learned

25:57.223 --> 26:01.025
who's really king
of this forest.

26:01.027 --> 26:02.027
Me.

26:06.265 --> 26:11.068
Unh!

26:21.547 --> 26:24.048
Zelena.

26:37.463 --> 26:40.531
And here I thought lions
were supposed to be brave.

26:40.533 --> 26:42.366
Coward.

26:42.368 --> 26:43.767
You saved me.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.703
You're lucky I did.

26:49.041 --> 26:52.242
Wow.

26:52.244 --> 26:53.811
What's happening to you?

26:53.813 --> 26:55.446
I don't have much time.

26:55.448 --> 26:56.647
This way.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.127
Are you okay?

27:10.129 --> 27:11.962
Yes. What happened?

27:11.964 --> 27:12.963
Are we... yeah.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.598
Outside the fairy mines.

27:14.600 --> 27:18.235
The black fairy must have
magicked us up here.

27:18.237 --> 27:20.304
Because now that
she has dark fairy dust,

27:20.306 --> 27:21.939
there's nothing
we can do to stop her.

27:21.941 --> 27:23.741
Well, that's not true.

27:23.743 --> 27:26.176
We can go back down there and
get the crystals for ourselves.

27:26.178 --> 27:28.012
You really think
it'll be that easy,

27:28.014 --> 27:29.513
after what we just went through?

27:29.515 --> 27:31.315
I think you've done
enough for today.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.416
You really think
this is all my fault?

27:32.418 --> 27:33.951
Think?

27:33.953 --> 27:35.119
If you didn't have to prove

27:35.121 --> 27:36.687
you were stronger
than everyone else,

27:36.689 --> 27:38.522
she wouldn't be sitting
on a magical nuke right now.

27:38.524 --> 27:39.790
So, let me fix it.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.425
And make things worse?

27:41.427 --> 27:45.029
If being the best is
so important to you, zelena,

27:45.031 --> 27:47.865
why don't you go someplace
where you can be on top?

27:47.867 --> 27:49.767
What are you saying?

27:49.769 --> 27:52.469
Go back to oz.

27:52.471 --> 27:56.206
At least there you can't make
things any worse for us.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.676
You don't mean that.

27:58.678 --> 28:01.979
I'm afraid I do.

28:01.981 --> 28:04.948
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
to find the charming family

28:04.950 --> 28:06.850
<i>so we can figure out how
to clean up your mess.</i>

28:06.852 --> 28:08.018
Regina...

28:20.999 --> 28:22.366
- Well, it's definitely...
- Bigger?

28:22.368 --> 28:24.068
<i>Well, I think
this space has great potential.</i>

28:24.070 --> 28:26.570
We could string lights from the
ceiling, put some trees around.

28:26.572 --> 28:29.573
It could be transformed into
something really magical.

28:29.575 --> 28:30.841
Yeah. I think it could be.

28:30.843 --> 28:32.576
Anyone else feel a draft?

28:32.578 --> 28:34.678
It's probably just
a window open somewhere.

28:34.680 --> 28:37.648
And look at the walls... the
whole place needs a paint job.

28:37.650 --> 28:39.183
Okay, dad, I know
that technically

28:39.185 --> 28:42.252
we're all royalty or whatever,
but unless you want to do

28:42.254 --> 28:44.254
a destination wedding at your
castle in the enchanted forest

28:44.256 --> 28:46.557
or, like, Excalibur in Vegas,
I don't think

28:46.559 --> 28:47.858
we're gonna find
what you're looking for.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.193
That's not a bad idea.

28:49.195 --> 28:50.594
Vegas? No. The enchanted forest,

28:50.596 --> 28:51.995
our castle.

28:51.997 --> 28:53.864
How many beans would it take
to get everyone back there?

28:53.866 --> 28:57.735
David, may I speak with you
outside for a second?

28:57.737 --> 28:58.836
Sure.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.072
So, elopement?

29:02.074 --> 29:04.975
Aye. I'll bring the rum.

29:07.779 --> 29:10.247
What is really going on?

29:10.249 --> 29:12.750
You can't really believe
this place is good enough.

29:12.752 --> 29:15.586
This isn't some town meeting
about parking regulations.

29:15.588 --> 29:16.854
It's our daughter's wedding.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.756
And if we wanted to get married
in our bathroom,

29:18.758 --> 29:22.092
it would be perfect and exactly
what it's supposed to be.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.293
None of that matters,
and you know it.

29:23.295 --> 29:24.728
So, what is this really about?

29:24.730 --> 29:28.365
I just... I don't know why
we have to rush into this.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.734
Rushing?

29:30.736 --> 29:32.636
David, if this is about hook,

29:32.638 --> 29:34.772
that ship has sailed,
and there's a pirate on it.

29:34.774 --> 29:36.974
Deal with it. No, this has
nothing to do with hook.

29:36.976 --> 29:38.942
This is about why
we insist on doing this

29:38.944 --> 29:40.878
with everything else
going on right now.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.279
Well, because, David, we agreed

29:42.281 --> 29:44.448
that we don't give in to fear,
and our people need hope.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.451
Well, what about what we need,
snow, what our family needs?

29:47.453 --> 29:49.153
What are you talking about?!

29:52.757 --> 29:56.326
The day I married you was
the best day of my life...

29:56.328 --> 29:58.428
Until the evil queen
burst through those doors

29:58.430 --> 30:00.063
and threatened
everyone we loved.

30:00.065 --> 30:01.665
Then it became one of the worst.

30:01.667 --> 30:03.767
I don't want that for Emma.

30:03.769 --> 30:05.602
When I walk her down the aisle,

30:05.604 --> 30:07.171
the only thing she should be
thinking about

30:07.173 --> 30:10.440
is the wonderful years ahead,
not Gideon or the black fairy,

30:10.442 --> 30:13.811
not any of it.

30:13.813 --> 30:16.146
With everything she's been
through, the least we can do

30:16.148 --> 30:19.750
is give her a real wedding day.

30:19.752 --> 30:23.821
What if we're not around
to give her that?

30:23.823 --> 30:25.489
<i>What if she's not?</i>

30:25.491 --> 30:28.959
She will be.

30:28.961 --> 30:31.695
That's where the hope comes in.

30:31.697 --> 30:34.865
Mom.

30:34.867 --> 30:36.834
Dad's right.

30:36.836 --> 30:39.369
Maybe...

30:39.371 --> 30:41.638
Maybe postponing the wedding
is the best thing,

30:41.640 --> 30:44.675
until we know that
the black fairy can't interrupt.

30:44.677 --> 30:47.110
What if we can't stop her?

30:47.112 --> 30:51.181
Well, then it would be
a really short marriage anyway.

30:55.320 --> 30:58.822
We love each other.

30:58.824 --> 31:00.691
We want to do this
when it's right...

31:02.994 --> 31:04.895
not out of fear and not
because we think we might die,

31:04.897 --> 31:07.097
but because we all know
it's the right time.

31:12.872 --> 31:14.171
Hey. I'm back.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.172
Hey.

31:15.174 --> 31:16.807
How, -

31:16.809 --> 31:19.309
how did your business go?

31:19.311 --> 31:22.512
Not as productive as I'd hoped,
but it doesn't matter anymore.

31:22.514 --> 31:23.747
How was she?

31:23.749 --> 31:26.250
She... she's a sweetheart.

31:26.252 --> 31:28.752
I'm, - I'm happy
to watch her anytime.

31:28.754 --> 31:32.256
I don't think that'll be
necessary, but thank you.

31:32.258 --> 31:34.825
What do you say, Robin?

31:34.827 --> 31:37.427
I think it's time
we went where we belong.

31:38.430 --> 31:39.663
Home.

32:51.135 --> 32:53.003
The crimson heart.

32:55.239 --> 32:56.239
So, what now?

32:56.241 --> 32:59.076
There's only one way
to find out.

32:59.078 --> 33:00.444
Ready?

33:00.446 --> 33:01.712
Yes.

33:20.032 --> 33:21.465
What's wrong?

33:21.467 --> 33:24.267
That thing...
It was draining my magic.

33:24.269 --> 33:25.869
What? Why?

33:25.871 --> 33:27.671
Because there's no magic
in that heart.

33:27.673 --> 33:30.307
It's just a worthless
piece of glass.

33:30.309 --> 33:32.676
For it to work, it needs
someone else's magic...

33:32.678 --> 33:34.878
My magic.

33:37.648 --> 33:39.883
You knew about this.

33:39.885 --> 33:42.386
Zelena, I swear I had no idea.

33:42.388 --> 33:44.287
You're lying.

33:44.289 --> 33:45.856
Who put you up to this?

33:45.858 --> 33:47.691
Was it Dorothy?

33:47.693 --> 33:49.292
I never should have let
that gingham-clad

33:49.294 --> 33:51.395
goody-two-shoes go back
to her wretched little farm.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.630
I don't know
anyone named Dorothy,

33:53.632 --> 33:56.900
and I promise you, I-i would
never trick you like that.

34:00.671 --> 34:04.508
You want to know how to find
what it is you're searching for?

34:04.510 --> 34:05.976
This is it.

34:05.978 --> 34:07.577
What are you talking about?

34:07.579 --> 34:10.147
It's what I was trying to tell
you before the lion attack.

34:10.149 --> 34:12.014
You don't need
a time-travel spell

34:12.016 --> 34:14.150
so you won't be alone.

34:14.152 --> 34:16.253
You just need some friends.

34:19.091 --> 34:22.426
Let me guess... like you?

34:22.428 --> 34:25.728
Do you actually think
I would give up my magic

34:25.731 --> 34:27.164
to save you?

34:27.166 --> 34:28.532
So you could have a friend
that would accept you

34:28.534 --> 34:30.000
when no one else did?

34:30.002 --> 34:31.201
Yes.

34:32.871 --> 34:35.237
No.

34:35.239 --> 34:38.542
Weren't you the one who told me
magic made me special?

34:38.543 --> 34:41.210
Magic isn't
what made you special.

34:41.213 --> 34:44.147
Your willingness
to use it for good is.

34:46.717 --> 34:48.685
If you leave me here to rust,

34:48.687 --> 34:51.922
you might walk away from here
with your power,

34:51.924 --> 34:57.461
but you'll be alone
a very long time.

34:57.463 --> 35:00.197
That's a risk
I'll just have to take.

35:07.405 --> 35:10.307
Sorry, stanum. You're wrong.

35:10.309 --> 35:13.810
<i>Magic is what made me special.</i>

35:13.812 --> 35:15.278
And I won't give it up.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.315
Zelena.

35:18.317 --> 35:21.151
Zelena. Enjoy life as a statue.

35:21.153 --> 35:23.353
Maybe Dorothy will come back
and save you.

35:25.590 --> 35:27.124
She did what?

35:27.126 --> 35:28.658
You've got to be kidding me.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.962
Unfortunately, I'm not.

35:31.964 --> 35:34.331
How is that,
even when your sister

35:34.333 --> 35:35.465
isn't the villain
that we're fighting,

35:35.467 --> 35:37.400
she's still the villain
that we're fighting?

35:37.402 --> 35:39.269
Believe me.
I had it out with her.

35:39.271 --> 35:40.737
She will no longer be a problem.

35:40.739 --> 35:41.938
Do we even know what
the black fairy

35:41.940 --> 35:43.006
needs the crystals for?

35:43.008 --> 35:45.142
To start the final battle,

35:45.144 --> 35:46.910
so she says.

35:46.912 --> 35:50.313
And has she done it?
Has it started?

35:50.315 --> 35:54.784
I don't know, Henry.
But we'll figure it out.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.419
Have you gotten anywhere
with that wand?

35:56.421 --> 35:58.321
Unfortunately, I got
a little sidetracked.

35:58.323 --> 36:01.458
But now that my family issues
are under control,

36:01.460 --> 36:02.626
I'm back on it.

36:02.628 --> 36:06.429
Maybe not as under control
as you'd like.

36:06.431 --> 36:07.831
What are you doing here?

36:07.833 --> 36:10.133
I thought we agreed
you were better off in oz.

36:10.135 --> 36:12.536
No. You agreed.

36:12.538 --> 36:15.205
And I was going to go.

36:15.207 --> 36:16.339
But then, I changed my mind.

36:16.341 --> 36:17.941
Why?

36:17.943 --> 36:19.876
Because, despite
what you may think,

36:19.878 --> 36:22.279
there's nothing for me in oz.

36:22.281 --> 36:23.947
Anyone who ever
cared for me there

36:23.949 --> 36:27.450
now hates me.

36:27.452 --> 36:29.519
Look, I know you and I
aren't exactly

36:29.521 --> 36:34.024
the sisters that our mother
wanted us to be, but...

36:34.026 --> 36:37.661
You're all I've got, Regina.

36:37.663 --> 36:40.564
Going down to those mines
was foolish and arrogant.

36:40.566 --> 36:46.336
And I'm sorry, but...
I-i think I can help now.

36:46.338 --> 36:47.904
What do you mean?

36:47.906 --> 36:50.373
The black fairy used my magic to
turn those fairy crystals dark,

36:50.375 --> 36:54.044
so my magic is
still tethered to it.

36:54.046 --> 36:56.346
Well, how does that help us?

36:56.348 --> 36:59.516
Because it also means
that we can destroy it...

36:59.518 --> 37:01.885
With this.

37:01.887 --> 37:04.187
What's that?

37:04.189 --> 37:06.756
Something I picked up
from oz via tornado.

37:06.758 --> 37:09.526
And what will it do?

37:09.528 --> 37:11.094
Destroy my magic.

37:56.641 --> 37:58.008
What's wrong?

38:01.912 --> 38:04.914
If something should happen,

38:04.916 --> 38:06.883
promise me
you'll look after Robin.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.652
Of course.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.387
But nothing is going to happen.

38:10.389 --> 38:12.122
Just promise.

38:14.392 --> 38:16.459
I promise.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.762
Me, too.

38:18.764 --> 38:20.664
She's one of us.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.132
We'll protect her
with our lives.

38:26.505 --> 38:27.837
Okay.

39:19.623 --> 39:20.824
How do you feel?

39:23.495 --> 39:24.561
Weak.

39:27.231 --> 39:31.134
But you've never
looked stronger.

39:31.136 --> 39:35.071
Zelena, I'm so sorry
for everything.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.410
I'm so proud of you.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.149
If this crystal is
back to normal,

39:46.151 --> 39:48.485
does that mean
all of them are, too?

39:48.487 --> 39:50.520
Yes.

39:50.522 --> 39:54.157
The black fairy's
back to square one.

39:54.159 --> 39:55.859
We should call mother superior.

39:55.861 --> 39:57.093
She can get the dwarfs
to start mining this stuff.

39:57.095 --> 39:58.161
It could come in handy.

39:58.163 --> 39:59.696
Well, good luck with that.

39:59.698 --> 40:01.097
She was the first person
I called

40:01.099 --> 40:03.700
to locate that wand fragment.

40:03.702 --> 40:06.002
I left a dozen messages,
but I haven't heard back.

40:06.004 --> 40:09.072
Gold.

40:09.074 --> 40:12.008
Gold's got her
in the back of his shop.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.079
I-I'm not not proud
of what I did,

40:16.081 --> 40:18.548
but I did what I thought
was best for myself.

40:18.550 --> 40:21.351
We both did.

40:21.353 --> 40:22.952
What are you doing here?

40:22.954 --> 40:24.621
We're here to help you.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.856
You're welcome.
Help me with what?

40:26.858 --> 40:30.126
Your little fairy problem which
you don't seem able to solve.

40:30.128 --> 40:32.061
The blue fairy.

40:32.063 --> 40:34.030
We might be able to wake her.

40:34.032 --> 40:37.300
Unless you found a way.

40:37.302 --> 40:39.969
Not yet, but I will.

40:39.971 --> 40:41.905
But we might not need
to wait, rumple,

40:41.907 --> 40:43.706
if you just let them try.

40:46.577 --> 40:50.980
Look, I realized today

40:50.982 --> 40:54.217
just how much we missed out on
with Gideon.

40:54.219 --> 40:57.253
And that's time that
we will never get back.

40:57.255 --> 41:01.391
But now that he's come here,
I-i refuse to let her

41:01.393 --> 41:03.393
steal any more of
our time with him.

41:08.232 --> 41:09.866
Get on with it.

41:31.522 --> 41:33.756
You did it.

41:33.758 --> 41:36.593
Her heart's beating again.

41:36.595 --> 41:38.828
Then it's only a matter of time
before we wake her up.

41:44.368 --> 41:47.504
First, they destroy
your dark magic.

41:47.506 --> 41:49.939
Now, they're one step closer
to waking her.

41:49.941 --> 41:52.075
I won't let them!

41:54.311 --> 41:55.845
That piece of wand
she has hidden

41:55.847 --> 41:58.281
must be powerful.

41:58.283 --> 41:59.949
Are you really so afraid of it?

41:59.951 --> 42:01.551
Of course not.

42:01.553 --> 42:02.986
That wand was never the reason

42:02.988 --> 42:05.855
I wanted that
insipid fairy asleep.

42:05.857 --> 42:07.957
Then what was it?

42:10.027 --> 42:13.129
She knows my darkest secret,

42:13.131 --> 42:18.167
one my son can never discover...

42:18.169 --> 42:20.670
The real reason I gave him up.

42:21.305 --> 42:27.710
