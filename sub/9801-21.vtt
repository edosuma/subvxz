WEBVTT

00:10.393 --> 00:13.566
Men, we live as a unit,
we fight as a unit

00:13.567 --> 00:15.983
and we sleep as a unit.

00:16.265 --> 00:19.824
It's been a rough week,
and the battle for shut-eye.

00:20.742 --> 00:24.256
The lemur auditorious assault
has been merciless!

00:25.374 --> 00:28.436
But tonight its doze or die!

00:28.437 --> 00:30.369
Arm yourself for lights out!

00:35.342 --> 00:37.080
Uh, night cap skipper?

00:37.081 --> 00:42.584
Good point.  One cup puts me
asleep like a teeny tiny little baby.

00:42.585 --> 00:44.185
I mean, that's not
your night cap.

00:44.186 --> 00:45.344
That is.

00:46.856 --> 00:50.524
Okay, maybe I'm not a 100% sleep shape.

00:50.525 --> 00:51.890
.

00:54.988 --> 00:57.554
Commencing "Lights Out Protocol".

01:00.348 --> 01:01.722
Where's the Private??

01:01.731 --> 01:04.558
For my kind offer when I made courtesy,

01:04.559 --> 01:06.521
bid me farewell

01:07.510 --> 01:09.999
Bravo! Bravo!

01:11.328 --> 01:12.879
Lights out!

01:17.203 --> 01:18.643
Reporting, Skipper.

01:18.644 --> 01:21.006
- Sorry, I was...
- Fraternizing with the enemy!

01:21.007 --> 01:22.234
Is that it, Private?

01:22.235 --> 01:23.235
Did you finally flip on us?

01:23.236 --> 01:24.755
No, Skipper, never. It seems...

01:24.756 --> 01:27.587
- the play is the thing I was...
- Private.

01:27.588 --> 01:31.235
I will wring the answers out of you in the A.M..
Now hit the box.

01:32.578 --> 01:33.763
What's up with Skipper?

01:33.764 --> 01:35.496
He seems a bit crappy and paranoid.

01:35.497 --> 01:37.448
I mean, you know, more than usual.

01:37.449 --> 01:39.798
"Lemor Party Induced Chronic Insomnia".

01:39.799 --> 01:42.759
Commonly known as "LPICI".

01:42.760 --> 01:43.903
At least by me.

01:43.904 --> 01:47.176
Earlier tonight, he spent an hour
interrogating the coffee machine.

01:47.177 --> 01:51.247
Give me your dark beedy secrets!

01:51.248 --> 01:52.498
Oh Skipper.

01:52.499 --> 01:55.562
Good night, sweet prince.
and flights of angels...

01:55.563 --> 01:57.272
Stop it, Private!

01:57.793 --> 02:00.362
Ten P.M. Lights out.

02:00.409 --> 02:01.804
Seriously.

02:01.983 --> 02:03.343
Ten o'de clocks!

02:03.344 --> 02:08.888
I declare Lemur Memorial Day Eve
festiveties open for partying!

02:08.889 --> 02:10.846
Oh let me!

02:13.823 --> 02:16.835
Sweet sour meat balls!
Don't those lemurs never sleep?

02:16.836 --> 02:19.591
Kowalski, review recent
boom box counter-measurs.

02:19.592 --> 02:23.731
Let's see. Monday, asked nicely
to turn the music down.

02:25.863 --> 02:28.655
Be quiet!

02:28.656 --> 02:32.711
This is New York. The city
that never sleeps!

02:32.712 --> 02:35.459
Because of you!

02:35.460 --> 02:37.509
Tuesday, gave dirty looks.

02:42.205 --> 02:45.636
Wednesday, blasted penguin
mating calls full volume.

02:48.378 --> 02:50.300
No effect. At least...

02:50.301 --> 02:51.361
not on the lemurs.

02:51.562 --> 02:52.675
How're you doing?

02:52.676 --> 02:54.675
Recommendations for next move?

02:54.709 --> 02:58.713
To be, or not to be?
That is the question.

02:58.714 --> 03:01.507
We need action, not waffeling! Rico?

03:02.687 --> 03:04.147
Voila'!

03:04.148 --> 03:06.242
I like the way you think, soldier.

03:06.243 --> 03:08.674
Perhaps we should try diplomacy.

03:08.675 --> 03:13.235
The art of resolving disputes by
negotiation or other non military means.

03:13.236 --> 03:14.186
Great.

03:14.187 --> 03:16.277
Why don't we just have a
cursing bee while we are at it?

03:16.278 --> 03:20.113
I know, it goes agains every bone in your
thermo-regulated body, Skipper

03:20.114 --> 03:23.325
but the diplomatic approach has been known to work.

03:23.326 --> 03:24.782
Except when it doesn't.

03:26.558 --> 03:30.121
Alright. Anything to get
a few dozen winks.

03:30.730 --> 03:35.231
At the behest of the penguins, we call
these peace treaty talks to order.

03:38.427 --> 03:39.777
Quite right, Phil.

03:39.778 --> 03:42.403
That is disturbing the peace treaty.

03:42.404 --> 03:44.074
Thank you, thank you.

03:44.075 --> 03:46.753
As king, I will speak first.

03:46.754 --> 03:48.956
I shall give to you ...

03:49.826 --> 03:53.922
Mort, and you, you know, shall go away.

03:53.923 --> 03:56.602
Oh, I'm a bargaining chip! Yay!

03:56.603 --> 03:58.613
We demand a ten o'clock curfew!

03:58.614 --> 03:59.980
No prob...

03:59.981 --> 04:02.076
Ten o'clock? Ten?

04:02.077 --> 04:06.169
We have not even begun to rock out by then!

04:06.282 --> 04:07.428
I love it that.

04:07.429 --> 04:11.305
"Oh, ruffians that will swear, 
dance, revel the night!"

04:11.306 --> 04:14.587
"Hours filled up with riots, banquets, sports! ..."

04:14.588 --> 04:15.644
Private!

04:15.645 --> 04:17.769
Buck off the oldtimer yankee-yak!

04:17.769 --> 04:18.885
We are negotiating

04:18.886 --> 04:21.899
- But Skipper, it's...
For you to be confined in contours!

04:21.899 --> 04:23.101
On the double!

04:23.102 --> 04:24.354
Aye, my lord.

04:24.355 --> 04:28.649
And so from hour to hour, 
we rot and rot.

04:29.383 --> 04:32.157
Oh goodie! I can still
catch the show!

04:35.152 --> 04:37.921
And so we returned conquering...

04:37.922 --> 04:39.488
What's that word for weeklings again?

04:39.489 --> 04:41.457
- Diplomats.
- All I know is that

04:41.458 --> 04:44.851
I'm finally gonna win the battle
for the Land of Nod.

04:46.122 --> 04:48.163
Private's gone AWOL again!

04:52.426 --> 04:53.760
Game over, Private.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.103
Who're you working for?

04:55.104 --> 04:57.312
I'm amazed and don't 
know what to say!

04:57.313 --> 04:58.578
That code again.

04:58.704 --> 05:00.315
Who's your outside contact?

05:00.316 --> 05:02.817
Skipper, Private is no double agent.

05:02.818 --> 05:04.913
He can't even cheat. 
at Go Fish.

05:04.914 --> 05:06.963
Alright, stand down, Rico.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.429
Know this, Private.

05:09.430 --> 05:12.165
I may be operating on 
short sleep rations

05:12.166 --> 05:16.621
but I have one watery blood-shot
highly trained eye on you!

05:16.622 --> 05:19.349
- Understand?
- Aye. Clearly.

05:19.350 --> 05:20.897
One more thing.

05:20.898 --> 05:24.964
I have one watery blood-shot
highly trained eye on you!

05:24.965 --> 05:26.403
Understand?

05:29.039 --> 05:32.390
Disturbing the peace treaty talk,
round two.

05:32.391 --> 05:33.787
We've reviewed the treaty.

05:33.788 --> 05:36.461
One sided, demoralizing, insulting!

05:36.462 --> 05:37.881
Oh, doubly!

05:37.882 --> 05:39.100
And good to go.

05:39.936 --> 05:42.166
Not so quickly tuxedo bird!

05:42.167 --> 05:45.700
We wish to add some
little appendages.

05:47.254 --> 05:48.755
Note the last item there.

05:48.756 --> 05:53.613
You big brained penguinwill invent for me
 the solar powered karaoke!

05:53.833 --> 05:55.739
And there is one time 
when this guy said:

05:55.740 --> 05:58.692
"Better a witty fool 
than a foolish wit"

05:59.039 --> 06:01.276
- How great is that!
- One moment!

06:02.001 --> 06:03.537
Alright, keep talking.

06:03.538 --> 06:06.571
- We had a deal!
- And we still do.

06:06.572 --> 06:10.794
I just have swapped the parts I don't like
with the parts I do like.

06:10.795 --> 06:12.056
Take it or heave it.

06:12.057 --> 06:13.438
- Leave it!
- Leave it?

06:13.439 --> 06:14.842
Wait, leave what?

06:15.361 --> 06:16.616
I'll sign

06:16.617 --> 06:18.899
Skipper, you're not thinking clearly!

06:22.608 --> 06:23.693
That was a good one.

06:23.694 --> 06:26.146
Don't try to confuse me
with your legalese.

06:26.147 --> 06:26.875
How about:

06:26.876 --> 06:29.101
"You're just little leather-jerking, 
crystal-button, 

06:29.102 --> 06:32.728
agate-ring, puke-stocking, 
caddis-garter Spanish pouches!"

06:36.342 --> 06:38.232
It's true!

06:40.398 --> 06:41.442
I think.

06:41.443 --> 06:45.749
I do not know the these words,
but I know when I am insulted.

06:45.750 --> 06:47.088
And I am insulted!

06:47.089 --> 06:49.550
- Heave it!
- Wait, he didn't mean it...

06:49.551 --> 06:51.178
Where's the pen! I need a pen!

06:51.179 --> 06:52.216
Too late.

06:52.217 --> 06:54.986
Good luck snoozing tonight.

06:54.987 --> 06:59.894
I'm turning the volumes up now 
to milleven.

06:59.895 --> 07:00.861
-teen!

07:00.862 --> 07:02.497
No! He doesn't speak for us!

07:02.498 --> 07:04.980
He's gone AWOL! He's a traitor!

07:04.981 --> 07:06.726
Traitor!

07:07.244 --> 07:09.826
You're really not thinking clearly.

07:10.313 --> 07:13.072
But Skipper, it was just Shakespeare
in the park.

07:13.073 --> 07:15.094
Speares! Shaking! In the park!

07:15.095 --> 07:16.727
It's worse than I thought.

07:16.854 --> 07:17.993
Did you hear that?

07:17.994 --> 07:19.272
Artilellery!

07:19.273 --> 07:21.014
The spear shakers are coming!

07:21.015 --> 07:22.123
Private, lock down!

07:22.124 --> 07:24.514
- But Skipper...
- That is an order, Kowalski!

07:26.643 --> 07:30.455
You might want to dial back
yield fancy talk.

07:30.456 --> 07:32.451
Do you even know what 
those words mean?

07:33.123 --> 07:34.216
No.

07:34.250 --> 07:37.599
The blast of war blows in our ears!

07:37.600 --> 07:39.748
Do you hear that, boys?
It's war talk!

07:39.749 --> 07:42.327
Just look at the size 
of that enemy in campement!

07:42.328 --> 07:45.440
- There must be nearly 1982 of them!

07:45.441 --> 07:48.710
Looks to me like an innocent 
theatrical presentation.

07:48.924 --> 07:52.156
What hace kings that Privates have not too?

07:52.157 --> 07:53.457
You call that innocent?

07:53.458 --> 07:56.743
It's a code. Something about
making Private a king!

07:56.744 --> 07:59.193
- Do you really think...
- This is not a drill!

07:59.194 --> 08:00.627
It 's a full-blown coup!

08:00.628 --> 08:02.835
Initiate operation "Break Speare"!

08:02.836 --> 08:05.423
Phase one: locte enemy munitions!

08:07.000 --> 08:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:18.128 --> 08:20.437
Please! We've go t to help Skipper!

08:20.438 --> 08:22.781
He suffers from sleep deprevation!

08:23.794 --> 08:26.846
I'm not hearing, or you think he's cute, 
you Traitor, you.

08:26.847 --> 08:29.974
I'm not a traitor! I was just 
quoting Shakespeare!

08:29.975 --> 08:32.390
That last one was from King Henry V!

08:32.390 --> 08:36.537
What? Who is claiming to be
a king, named Henry?

08:36.538 --> 08:39.224
That is a very stupid name
for a king!

08:39.225 --> 08:41.712
You lead me to the stupid
henry immediately!

08:41.714 --> 08:43.541
So I can ridicule his name

08:43.542 --> 08:45.470
and physical appearance.

08:46.766 --> 08:48.596
Prepare for combat!

08:51.782 --> 08:53.258
I love thou, Kate!

08:53.259 --> 08:56.616
I will kiss your hand and
I will call you my queen.

08:59.487 --> 09:01.410
Wait. what play are we doing?

09:06.332 --> 09:09.459
Look! That guy is
hitting the other guy.

09:09.460 --> 09:11.084
With sharp pointed metal.

09:11.085 --> 09:13.285
I took stage combat...

09:13.286 --> 09:15.501
and drama!

09:16.049 --> 09:18.232
You should have gone to knight school!

09:18.972 --> 09:20.218
It's the guys!

09:20.219 --> 09:23.102
I know only one thing about fights,
they are losing!

09:23.103 --> 09:25.072
Bigtime!
Come on!

09:30.548 --> 09:32.703
 - There are animals down here.
- Get away!

09:35.834 --> 09:36.962
Skipper!

09:38.362 --> 09:40.534
I will interupt that silly game!

09:40.535 --> 09:42.119
Perhaps a diversion!

09:42.773 --> 09:44.288
No canon balls!

09:50.832 --> 09:52.818
What play is this?

09:53.234 --> 09:56.627
Okay, I have two big problematic 
problems with you!

09:56.628 --> 09:59.069
You pretendy king!

09:59.964 --> 10:01.367
Rabies spyder monkey!

10:01.368 --> 10:03.082
- What?
- Hi, guys!

10:03.083 --> 10:05.172
You! Traitor!

10:15.660 --> 10:19.688
What have I done!

10:21.250 --> 10:23.287
What have I done!

10:23.288 --> 10:25.289
He definitely needs a nap.

10:25.290 --> 10:26.864
Forgive me, Private.

10:27.969 --> 10:29.330
I'll forgive you, Skipper.

10:29.331 --> 10:30.966
It's not your fault
that you can't sleep.

10:30.967 --> 10:33.603
Private! You should be
with Manfredi e Jhonson!

10:33.604 --> 10:36.571
you know? One up there,
one down there.

10:36.572 --> 10:39.137
No, it's make-believe? Harmless.

10:40.494 --> 10:42.018
No, it isn't!

10:48.030 --> 10:50.352
I love this theater king!

10:50.353 --> 10:53.319
I'm adding season tickets
to our list of demands.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.311
But I think we don't
need a treaty anymore.

10:55.312 --> 10:57.872
Skipper has finally found a
place to get some sleep.
