RADIO OFFICER 1:
<i>One in burgundy's
going downtown...</i>

00:13.263 --> 00:15.140
I ain't gonna be here long,
you know.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.558
That's all I'm saying.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.437
They just don't know
who they're fucking with.

00:20.437 --> 00:23.273
RADIO OFFICER 2:
<i>Copy. Jenkins for transport.</i>

00:25.692 --> 00:27.569
Now, I'm sure they realize,
you know,

00:27.569 --> 00:29.195
you know, by now,
they got the wrong guy.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.906
I mean, phone calls,
they're being made.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.746
Swear to God, man, my boy's
got a game this weekend.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.622
I miss that shit,
I'm gonna sue, motherfucker.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.332
You can bet your ass on that.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.626
DETENTION OFFICER 2: Stop.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.796
Jenkins, Wayne.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.798
Transport

00:48.882 --> 00:51.593

- DETENTION OFFICER 2: Let's go.

01:34.928 --> 01:38.348
You're fucking out of your mind.

01:41.559 --> 01:42.727
Eh...

02:06.543 --> 02:08.545
<i>And every
fucking shift I end up</i>

02:15.343 --> 02:16.719
waiting for two-A-15 post.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.555
Oh, my heart
bleeds for you, Hairston.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.348
Fuck you, man.
You don't have to drive

02:20.348 --> 02:21.641
that junk every day.

02:41.369 --> 02:42.745
You Jenkins?
Yes, sir.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.331
Come on. I'm not a sir.

02:45.415 --> 02:48.251
I'm two-Baker-23 post,
and so are you.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.628
- Excuse me?
- Sergeant says you ride with me.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.505
I'm your training officer.
Eddie Barber.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.798
Okay.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.258
Tell me something, Jenkins. Sure.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.594
- What's your sequence number?
- Uh, sequence number?

02:57.594 --> 03:00.305
Henry-383, sir.
I'm... I'm sorry, I mean, Ed.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.807
They're popping them
out of the academy

03:02.891 --> 03:06.185
with Henry-sequence numbers?
Holy fucking Christ.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.688
- I'm a Frank.
- Okay.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.523
You need coffee?
- Uh, no thank you.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.735
I fuckin' need coffee.
No police work without coffee.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.195
Shift attention!

03:18.489 --> 03:20.783
All right
everyone, find your seats.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.410
You sit right here.

03:23.828 --> 03:25.622
Today's the same
as yesterday, gents.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.373
The brass want bodies.
All you got.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.627
All corners are indicted.
All drug-free zones are empty.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.754
All the humbles are in play.
We clear the streets.

03:32.754 --> 03:36.299
Lieutenant,
you know this is bullshit.

03:36.299 --> 03:39.510
They cut most of them guys loose
right inside of the jail doors.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.763
So what? We still leave
the corners empty for the night,

03:41.763 --> 03:42.972
and if the corners are empty,

03:43.056 --> 03:44.307
they can't
fuckin' shoot each other.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.475
This is the priority.

03:45.475 --> 03:46.935
And if you don't give
your shiny silver bracelets

03:46.935 --> 03:49.145
a workout today, you'll need
to see me after the shift

03:49.145 --> 03:50.605
to explain why.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.231
It's a date.
I'd prefer it not be,

03:52.315 --> 03:53.650
but I'm not judging you
if that's...

03:53.650 --> 03:55.610
All that shit they taught you
in the Academy about procedure

03:55.610 --> 03:56.945
and probable cause?

03:56.945 --> 03:58.279
Fuck that now.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.697
And what do they call it now,

03:59.781 --> 04:02.283
cultural sensitivity training
they give you?

04:02.367 --> 04:04.035
Fuck that shit, too.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.496
This is Baltimore.

04:06.496 --> 04:10.416
Jones, Tyler.
Date of birth, March 31st, 1978.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.168
Wanted for heroin trafficking.

04:12.168 --> 04:13.920
Address, 1100
East Fayette Street.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.797
Warrant was issued
August 13th...

04:15.797 --> 04:17.799
You gonna lock me up for comin' out the carry-out?

04:17.799 --> 04:19.258
- Shut the fuck up.
- This some bullshit, man.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.344
Can't stand the police, man.
Bullshit, man.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.304
Just tryin' to get
some chicken out here, man.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.015
If I get stuck
with a needle,

04:26.099 --> 04:28.309
- you gonna take an ass-whupping.
- I ain't got no needle, man.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.895
I ain't doing shit.
I was gonna go see my girl

04:30.979 --> 04:32.522
when y'all rolled up.

04:32.522 --> 04:33.815
Where's your girl live?

04:33.815 --> 04:35.775
Port Street.
We're on Milton.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.319
I was walking there.
Goddamn!

04:41.239 --> 04:42.615
Hey, come take him.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.327
Come on, man!
- What's the charge on that guy?

04:46.411 --> 04:47.662
Loitering in a drug-free zone,

04:47.662 --> 04:49.163
failure to yield,
failure to obey.

04:49.247 --> 04:50.623
What's any of that do in court?

04:50.707 --> 04:52.333
Doesn't go to court.
Pulls them off the street

04:52.417 --> 04:53.668
till they see
the Court Commissioner

04:53.668 --> 04:55.378
in the morning,
then they drop the charges.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.714
Or if the ASA cuts him loose
on the jail side,

04:57.714 --> 05:00.049
- then maybe he's indoors till early morning.
- Man, fuck you!

05:00.133 --> 05:02.885
- And that's a good thing?
- That's what they want.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.221
Like the LT says,
if we clear the corners,

05:05.221 --> 05:06.347
they'll stop
shooting each other.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.515
If they stop shooting
each other,

05:07.515 --> 05:08.516
the murder rate goes down,

05:08.516 --> 05:09.851
and if the murder rate
goes down,

05:09.851 --> 05:11.352
the mayor
gets to be the governor.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.563
So all this is
about the mayor, huh?

05:13.563 --> 05:14.814
Fuckin' O'Malley
promised he'd get

05:14.814 --> 05:16.107
the murder rate
below 200 a year,

05:16.107 --> 05:18.359
but he ain't even close.
So we gotta clear the corners

05:18.443 --> 05:20.820
so that the governor can't say
Marty runs a shithole city.

05:22.697 --> 05:25.324
You just gonna
lock anybody up, huh?

05:25.408 --> 05:26.784
Anybody and everybody.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.704
ARRESTEE 2:
Get your hands off of me!

05:29.704 --> 05:31.622
You two wanna ride?

05:31.706 --> 05:33.875
This my house.
I don't give a fuck.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.044
You gonna lock me up
for sitting on my own steps?

05:36.044 --> 05:37.587
I am
if you're still on your ass

05:37.587 --> 05:39.213
ten seconds from now.

05:44.343 --> 05:45.720
ARRESTEE 3:
What're we being charged for?

05:45.720 --> 05:47.305
See? Like the bosses say,

05:47.305 --> 05:48.639
them two fellas
ain't gonna get shot

05:48.723 --> 05:50.308
or shoot anyone now.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.018
That's the theory, anyway.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.102
Yeah.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.645
ARRESTEE 3:
Excuse me, I'm talking to you!

05:54.729 --> 05:56.064
- I get it.
- ARRESTEE 4: What did we do?

05:56.064 --> 05:57.398
We asked you, what did we do?

05:57.482 --> 05:59.609
OFFICER 1:
<i>What's the 20 on the 10-14?</i>

05:59.609 --> 06:01.027
OFFICER 2:
<i>Five-hundred block of Milton.</i>

06:01.027 --> 06:02.570
ARRESTEE 3:
Why am I being detained?

06:33.976 --> 06:35.019
- Back up!
- Back up!

06:37.980 --> 06:39.774
<i>Baltimore is a poster child</i>

06:39.774 --> 06:43.277
for the basic failure
to stop lawlessness.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.321
No justice, no peace!

06:45.321 --> 06:47.907
I have heard your calls
for no justice, no peace...

06:47.907 --> 06:49.784
No justice, no peace!

07:18.396 --> 07:20.648
<i>Where there's
smoke, there's fire.</i>

07:20.648 --> 07:24.318
These officers,
they're 1930s-style gangsters.

07:37.665 --> 07:41.377
What's going on, Jemell?
You good, man?

07:41.377 --> 07:44.714
Hey. Ain't nothin' but a quick
visit downtown for me, man.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.632
Yeah?
Yeah, man!

07:46.716 --> 07:48.092
I told 'em nothing!

07:48.176 --> 07:50.678
Don't say shit,
ain't gonna be shit, Jemell!

07:50.678 --> 07:52.305
Just keep your mouth shut!

07:52.305 --> 07:55.016
These motherfuckers ain't got
a fucking thing, Jemell!

07:55.016 --> 07:57.226
And keep
your motherfucking mouth shut!

08:07.111 --> 08:08.404
Mr. Rayam,

08:08.404 --> 08:11.574
you have elected not to have
a lawyer present at this time.

08:13.034 --> 08:16.287
At 500 an hour?

08:16.287 --> 08:17.538
Yeah, fuck that shit.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.081
Do you
acknowledge that anything--

08:19.165 --> 08:21.334
I got it. Yes.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.254
When we get
to the proffer sessions,

08:25.338 --> 08:26.422
you will have an attorney here,

08:26.422 --> 08:29.759
just as federal prosecutors
will be in the room.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.844
The thing is, you can't lie.

08:31.928 --> 08:32.929
You get caught in a lie,

08:32.929 --> 08:34.680
I mean, even
if you leave anything out,

08:34.764 --> 08:36.974
you jeopardize any deal
for your cooperation.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.100
Understand?

08:39.852 --> 08:43.272
I get it. Just set it up. Damn.

08:44.815 --> 08:46.567
Thing is, though,
y'all might wanna keep Jenkins

08:46.651 --> 08:47.985
away from the rest of us.

08:49.654 --> 08:50.571
What's he doing?

08:50.655 --> 08:51.822
Every chance he gets,

08:51.906 --> 08:54.909
he's telling us
to hold tight, say nothing.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.744
I just passed him
at the detention center,

08:56.744 --> 08:58.246
and he was talking that shit.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.123
Thin blue line, you know?

09:03.918 --> 09:08.381
I mean, he was always
talking that shit, to be honest.

09:09.632 --> 09:10.967
<i>And some of you know me,</i>

09:10.967 --> 09:12.635
<i>and the rest of you
will get to know me.</i>

09:12.635 --> 09:14.136
<i>For those of you
familiar with me</i>

09:14.220 --> 09:17.348
<i>from my stint as Assistant Chief
in Prince George's County,</i>

09:17.348 --> 09:19.642
you know that I back up
my men and women,

09:19.642 --> 09:21.477
until there's a line
that's crossed.

09:21.477 --> 09:23.896
I won't name names,
but there was a recent incident

09:23.980 --> 09:26.524
in which an officer
in one of our plainclothes units

09:26.524 --> 09:29.277
was banned
from the city courthouses

09:29.277 --> 09:31.445
after he was caught
filming a witness

09:31.529 --> 09:34.198
and television reporter.
Witness intimidation.

09:34.282 --> 09:37.618
Gangbanger shit.

09:37.702 --> 09:40.454
Unbefitting of a police officer
by anyone's standard.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.499
And that wasn't
his only offense.

09:43.499 --> 09:46.711
There are many in his file.
And while I understand

09:46.711 --> 09:49.213
that the work
of our plainclothes units

09:49.297 --> 09:52.091
is where we have
to police aggressively--

09:52.091 --> 09:53.342
Free Laronde!

09:57.680 --> 10:00.057
Officer Laronde...

10:00.141 --> 10:02.435
...has been
suspended from duty.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.730
And his case will be
proceeding to a trial board.

10:05.730 --> 10:09.275
His behavior was unacceptable,
and it stains us all.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.153
On behalf of
Deputy Commissioner Palmere,

10:12.153 --> 10:14.530
I can tell all of you
working plainclothes,

10:14.530 --> 10:16.615
anti-crime,
and drug enforcement,

10:16.699 --> 10:18.868
that we understand
how hard your work is,

10:18.868 --> 10:22.121
and we will have your backs.
But there is a limit.

10:23.664 --> 10:26.500
That's all for today. Come on.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.878
Damn, you inspired?
Guess we ain't doing

10:28.878 --> 10:30.546
- any police work today.
- Bring me that asshole.

10:30.546 --> 10:31.881
Might as well go to the bar

10:31.881 --> 10:33.424
and work on our fucking tans.

10:45.686 --> 10:48.022
You wanted to see me, sir?

10:48.022 --> 10:50.149
The fuck was that?

10:50.149 --> 10:51.692
I, uh...
I'm sorry, sir.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.819
Sometimes my mouth just,
you know,

10:53.903 --> 10:55.154
kind of gets away from me.

10:56.447 --> 10:57.490
You're Jenkins?

10:58.491 --> 11:00.242
I am, sir.

11:00.951 --> 11:01.952
Hmm.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.954
It won't happen again, sir.

11:10.419 --> 11:11.420
Well...

11:11.504 --> 11:14.131
I think he kinda likes me.
Know what I mean? Shit.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.758
Know what I mean?

11:18.469 --> 11:19.929
What did you want me
to listen to?

11:19.929 --> 11:21.931

11:39.532 --> 11:41.575
He goes by Young Moose.
He's calling out Hersl.

11:41.659 --> 11:45.204
So Hersl's so badass, he makes
his way into the local folklore.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.164
I mean, how can this guy
be such an open secret?

11:47.248 --> 11:49.333
He hasn't been suspended
because none of the complaints

11:49.417 --> 11:51.502
make it past
the trial board findings.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.295
And then he's still
working plainclothes

11:53.379 --> 11:56.549
because he gets out of his car
and makes arrests.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.633

12:00.511 --> 12:02.346
Where you off to?

12:02.430 --> 12:04.056
You're not a hip-hop fan?

12:04.140 --> 12:05.683
Not since
they gunned down Biggie.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.022
Anything
you want me to ask him?

12:12.106 --> 12:15.234
Just make sure you check his ass
before you sit down.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.111
You might find
a third GPS tracker

12:17.111 --> 12:18.737
in between his cheeks.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.121
Look, man, why am I here, bruh?

12:27.121 --> 12:29.957
Look, man, I ain't had shit
in that hotel room.

12:29.957 --> 12:32.418
True. But we've charged you
with possession

12:32.418 --> 12:34.336
in excess
of 100 grams of heroin

12:34.420 --> 12:36.964
that occurred
on February 9th, 2015,

12:36.964 --> 12:39.425
by city police officers.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.011
Man. Fuck that, man.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.888
- That's old news.
- Not anymore.

12:43.888 --> 12:44.972
You should've worked
that charge off

12:44.972 --> 12:46.515
for the city
while you had the chance.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.392
See, now
we're trading up, Aaron.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.977
And since you blew off
those city cops,

12:49.977 --> 12:53.439
for me to even consider
a federal cooperation agreement,

12:53.439 --> 12:55.983
you need to tell us a whole lot
that we don't yet know.

12:55.983 --> 12:58.486
Look, I'll be square.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.613
As long as I don't got
to wear no wire.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.115
No promises.

13:07.077 --> 13:08.871
Tell us about
Antonio Shropshire.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.332
Man, I cut him loose
months ago, man.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.666
He Brill to me.

13:12.750 --> 13:16.170
- I get my stuff elsewhere now.
- How'd you two communicate?

13:16.170 --> 13:18.464
Call him and we meet.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.800
- Can you go back to him?
- Hell, no.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.594
You know,
Brill had Twan and Munch

13:23.594 --> 13:25.596
kick my door in
about two weeks ago.

13:25.596 --> 13:28.224
That's why I switched up
and moved to the Red Roof.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.975
We saw your door got kicked in.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.102
You think that was Shropshire's
people who did that?

13:32.186 --> 13:33.395
Hell, yeah.

13:34.355 --> 13:37.608
But you know somethin'?

13:37.608 --> 13:40.569
I wouldn't say anything at all
if y'all were city cops.

13:40.653 --> 13:44.031
'Cause Brill? Brill tight
with a cop he grew up with.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.324
Name of G-Money,

13:46.784 --> 13:48.118
works in narcotics.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.627
<i>And Gondo was in the car?</i>

13:56.627 --> 14:00.631
Yeah.
Gondo was in the car.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.593
How did you know
Anderson wasn't home?

14:04.677 --> 14:06.470
<i>His ride was gone.</i>

14:06.554 --> 14:09.181
<i>But we knew that.
We had a tracker on it, so...</i>

14:09.265 --> 14:11.267
<i>we'd been watching him
come and go.</i>

14:11.267 --> 14:12.935
<i>We knew he rolled out.</i>

14:12.935 --> 14:15.521
Nobody else in that crib, right?

14:15.521 --> 14:17.147
No. Not that I know.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.067
- Watch our six.
- I got you.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.905
<i>Gondo stayed
in the car because...?</i>

14:24.989 --> 14:26.115
<i>We didn't need him.</i>

14:26.115 --> 14:28.742
<i>Me and Glen was enough
if the place was empty.</i>

14:28.826 --> 14:30.244
<i>And Gondo didn't wanna risk it.</i>

14:30.244 --> 14:32.913
<i>In case for some reason
Anderson was up in there.</i>

14:32.997 --> 14:35.958
<i>He thought Anderson
might recognize him or whatever.</i>

14:35.958 --> 14:37.293
<i>Anderson knew Gondo</i>

14:37.293 --> 14:39.128
<i>because of how Gondo
came up with Shropshire</i>

14:39.128 --> 14:41.046
<i>and Glen and all of them.</i>

14:42.715 --> 14:44.466
<i>And the place
wasn't empty, correct?</i>

14:44.550 --> 14:46.468
<i>Turns out his girl was inside</i>

14:46.552 --> 14:47.886
<i>and it was good we wore masks.</i>

14:47.970 --> 14:49.972
Bitch, where the shit at? Where
the fuck the money at, bitch?

14:49.972 --> 14:52.391
- Get yo ass on the ground!
- Okay! Okay! What do you want?

14:52.391 --> 14:53.726
<i>She wasn't no trouble, though.</i>

14:53.726 --> 14:55.269
Don't look at me!

14:55.269 --> 14:56.979
Get on the ground.
Get on the fucking ground!

14:56.979 --> 14:58.272
Okay! Okay! Okay!

14:58.272 --> 14:59.857
What do you want?
What are you looking for?

14:59.857 --> 15:01.692
<i>Truth is, most people
answer your questions</i>

15:01.692 --> 15:03.110
<i>when you put a gun
to their face.</i>

15:03.110 --> 15:04.445
Where is
the fucking shit, bitch?

15:04.445 --> 15:06.363
I don't know.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.991
Ain't a game, yo!
- Okay! Okay!

15:16.165 --> 15:17.416
<i>Maybe G-Money is why</i>

15:17.416 --> 15:19.460
<i>Shropshire can run
an open-air drug market.</i>

15:19.460 --> 15:21.253
<i>Slow down,
we don't know that.</i>

15:21.337 --> 15:23.088
Look, put in the affidavit
that Anderson said

15:23.172 --> 15:25.841
Shropshire often used the phone
to conduct business.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.468
Should I use his name?

15:27.468 --> 15:30.095
Call him Cooperator Number Four.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.930
And do a photo array
of Anderson,

15:32.014 --> 15:34.850
show it to any of his customers
who may have OD'd and lived.

15:43.609 --> 15:47.029
Mr. Drummond, I'm Nicole Steele
with the Department of Justice.

15:47.738 --> 15:50.032
So? What can I do for the DOJ?

15:50.032 --> 15:52.534
Can't be anything to do with
what just happened in Part 23

15:52.618 --> 15:55.537
of the Baltimore Circuit Court.
Although, to be honest,

15:55.621 --> 15:57.081
the plea bargain
I just pulled for my client

15:57.081 --> 15:59.667
will one day be the stuff
of defense attorney legend.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.252
I'm not here
to poach from your memoirs,

16:02.336 --> 16:03.379
I promise.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.547
You're representing Young Moose?

16:05.631 --> 16:07.508
Someone from
the Department of Justice

16:07.508 --> 16:09.301
is actually a fan of hip-hop?

16:09.385 --> 16:11.095
I'm with
the Civil Rights Division.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.930
Well, that explains it.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.391
So
this isn't about trial work.

16:15.391 --> 16:18.268
This is working
toward a federal consent decree.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.354
And we've at least
parsed the words of your client

16:20.354 --> 16:23.899
- with regard to Detective Hersl.
- You're interested in Hersl?

16:24.650 --> 16:26.568
- How could we not be?
- Hmm.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.738
I'd like to talk to your client,
on the record, if possible,

16:29.822 --> 16:32.116
and if that's not possible,
as background.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.868
I can ask,
but I can't promise anything.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.246
Uh, but it's gonna
be hard to explain to him

16:37.246 --> 16:39.331
that there might actually be
a part of the government

16:39.415 --> 16:41.250
that gives a damn
what he raps about.

16:41.250 --> 16:44.253
I'm just another lawyer,
I get it.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.004
If he talks to you
and he decides

16:46.088 --> 16:48.215
he doesn't want you
to use anything he tells you,

16:48.215 --> 16:49.633
it stays off the record.

16:49.717 --> 16:50.926
- Got it.
- Okay.

16:50.926 --> 16:53.762
I look forward to your call.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.182
Fuck me.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.852
Those lazy sons of bitches
can't even write the damn number

16:59.852 --> 17:02.771
of a parking spot on the log.

17:02.855 --> 17:06.108
- What's the tag again?
- Queen-two-seven.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.620
Hey.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.331
Hey, Sean. What up, man?

17:21.415 --> 17:23.959
I ain't seen you in a minute.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.919
How's Citywide Shootings Unit
treating you?

17:26.003 --> 17:28.464
Uh, homicide.
I just transferred over.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.299
Yeah? For real?

17:31.675 --> 17:34.344
Hey, what's...
what's the angle working bodies?

17:34.428 --> 17:37.473
You can't even
make any money working homicide.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.142
We solve murder cases
and take 'em into court.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.478
How about you? What do you do?

17:42.478 --> 17:45.022
I make arrests and I make money.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.857
Man, my overtime alone?

17:49.276 --> 17:51.403
Come on, man.
I'm fucking with y'all!

17:53.238 --> 17:56.408
Good luck, whatever little shit
y'all working on, all right?

18:00.746 --> 18:03.165
Motherfuckers get
reserved parking spaces

18:03.165 --> 18:04.208
to jam up drug addicts

18:04.208 --> 18:06.168
and we gotta hike
the fucking garage

18:06.168 --> 18:08.003
to look for a beater
to work a body?

18:10.214 --> 18:12.007
Who was that fucker?

18:12.007 --> 18:13.967
Name's Gondo, G-Money.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.511
We worked plainclothes together.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.638
Another asshole who thinks
hopping out on corners

18:17.638 --> 18:19.973
and going into
everybody's pockets is the shit.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.684
I've been there, bro.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.562
Who is teaching
these idiots how to do the job?

18:29.233 --> 18:30.567
<i>Intake line is on the left.</i>

18:30.651 --> 18:33.278
<i>When you get to the front,
give your last name first.</i>

18:33.362 --> 18:34.905
<i>If your charging document
isn't there,</i>

18:34.905 --> 18:36.657
step to the back wall and wait.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.158
If you do have your paperwork...

18:38.242 --> 18:39.618
How come we followed
the wagon here?

18:39.618 --> 18:42.287
Part of your training,
I wanted you to see this.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.539
Stay in line.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.457
We gonna
keep it orderly in here.

18:45.541 --> 18:46.708
Jessamy is so fuckin' mad

18:46.792 --> 18:48.335
we're dumping bodies
into her courtrooms,

18:48.335 --> 18:50.087
she's planted
an assistant state's attorney

18:50.087 --> 18:51.213
right here at intake.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.881
She takes a look
at the arrest reports,

18:52.965 --> 18:54.424
if she sees that it's horseshit,

18:54.508 --> 18:56.134
she offers
the sad-ass motherfuckers

18:56.218 --> 18:57.803
the chance
to sign one of those waivers.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.137
What are those waivers?

18:59.221 --> 19:00.681
It says if you agree
not to sue the balls

19:00.681 --> 19:02.266
off of the city
for false arrest,

19:02.266 --> 19:04.226
they'll let you go right now
with the charges dropped.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.937
Really? What happens
if you don't sign?

19:06.937 --> 19:08.605
You just have to go
to lockup till tomorrow,

19:08.689 --> 19:09.648
maybe tomorrow afternoon,

19:09.648 --> 19:10.858
wait to see
the Court Commissioner,

19:10.858 --> 19:12.192
and have the charges
dropped then.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.736
But we're charging bullshit.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.990
Kid, there's no dictatorship
in America more solid

19:17.990 --> 19:19.533
than a beat cop on his post.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.952
Telling you right now.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.037
If I ain't had these cuffs on,
but you fucking around...

19:24.121 --> 19:26.039
Man, this is fucked.
Come on.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.918
Let me see
your charging documents.

19:30.002 --> 19:33.255
Yeah. So, Anderson gave us
Shropshire's phone number

19:33.255 --> 19:35.591
and we checked the logs,
and sure enough,

19:35.591 --> 19:37.342
we can confirm that
there was, uh,

19:37.426 --> 19:39.386
numerous conversations
between the two.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.471
Yeah. That,
and the times and durations

19:41.555 --> 19:42.514
of those phone calls,

19:42.598 --> 19:44.892
plus observation
of suspected drug activity

19:44.892 --> 19:46.018
should give us, uh,

19:46.018 --> 19:47.769
enough to get a wire
on Shropshire's mobile.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.855
And we'll get a tracker
on Shropshire's car

19:49.855 --> 19:50.981
for good measure.

19:50.981 --> 19:53.192
So that's the status
of the narcotics probe.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.610
At this point,
there's enough for us

19:54.610 --> 19:56.028
to look at the possibility
that we have

19:56.028 --> 19:57.446
another investigation
to spin off.

19:58.238 --> 19:59.197
Leo here is gonna be heading up

19:59.281 --> 20:00.657
everything and anything
we come across

20:00.741 --> 20:02.576
regarding police involvement
with these guys.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.578
And I've invited
Special Agent Jensen

20:04.578 --> 20:05.579
and Sergeant Sieracki,

20:05.579 --> 20:07.623
a Baltimore police officer
with city IAD

20:07.623 --> 20:10.542
and detail to the FBI
public corruption squad

20:10.626 --> 20:12.419
to sit in
and begin gathering string.

20:12.419 --> 20:13.837
Great. Well, uh...

20:13.921 --> 20:16.214
...we got a whole ball
of yarn as it stands.

20:16.298 --> 20:19.259
For starters, Anderson claims
Shropshire has an in

20:19.343 --> 20:21.470
with a Baltimore City
narcotics detective.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.013
Name he had was "G-Money."

20:23.013 --> 20:25.140
Anderson alleges
that Shropshire said

20:25.140 --> 20:27.225
he and G-Money
grew up together and were tight.

20:27.309 --> 20:28.894
Specifics?

20:30.062 --> 20:31.897
So far, only
that Anderson believes

20:31.897 --> 20:34.149
that G-Money
"has Shropshire's back."

20:34.149 --> 20:35.567
Those are his words.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.361
And we think that's why
Anderson was worried

20:37.361 --> 20:39.112
that G-Money
might tip off Shropshire

20:39.196 --> 20:40.530
that he was cooperating with us.

20:40.614 --> 20:42.074
And then,
of course, the second tracker.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.118
Right. Uh, no way yet
to know how this fits in,

20:45.202 --> 20:46.787
but when we retrieved
our tracker

20:46.787 --> 20:47.996
from Anderson's vehicle,
we found

20:48.080 --> 20:50.832
- a second tracking device.
- Go on.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.209
We subpoenaed the records,

20:52.209 --> 20:53.794
and it was bought
by John Clewell,

20:53.794 --> 20:55.420
who happens to be
a Baltimore police officer

20:55.504 --> 20:58.215
assigned to a citywide
plainclothes unit chasing guns.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.009
So what's interesting
is why would a detective's

21:01.093 --> 21:02.761
privately-owned tracker
be attached

21:02.761 --> 21:04.304
to a known
drug dealer's vehicle?

21:04.388 --> 21:06.014
Well, I do know that the, uh...

21:06.098 --> 21:08.517
the city guys
are often short on equipment,

21:08.517 --> 21:09.935
and, uh...

21:09.935 --> 21:12.437
...they've been known
to buy or rent their own gear.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.648
That's true,
but here's the kicker. So far,

21:14.648 --> 21:17.109
we haven't heard one word
from anyone in Baltimore City.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.069
Not a call.
Not a word from Clewell

21:19.069 --> 21:20.654
or anyone
in the Gun Trace Task Force.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.489
And it's been weeks
since we arrested Anderson

21:22.489 --> 21:23.949
and found their tracker.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.409
It's still just sitting
in my desk.

21:25.409 --> 21:29.121
- Does the tracker have value?
- They're not cheap.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.372
That says something.

21:31.581 --> 21:32.833
Sure does.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.754
<i>Okay, send him onto Greenmount.</i>

21:37.838 --> 21:39.715
All right, Sarge. I got you.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.133
<i>All right.</i>
What'd he want?

21:41.133 --> 21:43.385
There's a serious shooting
on Greenmount and 22nd.

21:43.385 --> 21:45.095
And get this,

21:45.095 --> 21:46.680
Sarge wants you
to take that one.

21:51.935 --> 21:53.270
I told him
that leaves me alone

21:53.270 --> 21:54.438
on my first case.

21:54.438 --> 21:57.899
- What'd he say to that?
- He had faith in me.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.862
He doesn't know my name,
but he has faith in me.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.824
Look, just take it slow.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.285
Don't let nobody rush you.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.287
I'll try to get back
to you as soon as I can.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.705
All right.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.091
Take your time, Sean,
it's your scene.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.768
DISPATCHER 1:
<i>Be advised, nine-Baker-11</i>

22:32.768 --> 22:34.686
<i>had an armed carjacking
in the unit block</i>

22:34.770 --> 22:35.896
<i>of East Hamburg street.</i>

22:35.896 --> 22:38.023
<i>Taken was a 2012 Acura
with Maryland tags.</i>

22:38.023 --> 22:39.107
Hey.
- Hey.

22:40.484 --> 22:41.735
DISPATCHER 1:
<i>Suspects are three,
number one male,</i>

22:41.735 --> 22:43.779
<i>armed with
unknown caliber handguns.</i>

22:43.779 --> 22:45.489
<i>If you come in contact
with this car,</i>

22:45.489 --> 22:48.533
<i>these individuals,
please approach with caution.</i>

22:48.617 --> 22:51.453
<i>Hold occupants
and contact citywide robbery.</i>

23:18.522 --> 23:21.233
Yep.
He's got working-man calluses.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.492
Excuse me.

23:30.492 --> 23:33.078
Can you get a wide shot of this
from behind the fence?

24:15.412 --> 24:16.663
If it was me,
I would've parked

24:16.663 --> 24:17.998
in the satellite lot. Well,

24:17.998 --> 24:19.833
Shropshire doesn't worry
about his budget.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.338
Where do you think he's off to?

24:25.422 --> 24:28.008
A Mensa convention? How the fuck
am I supposed to know?

24:34.639 --> 24:36.057
All right, I think you're clear.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.392
What? Why do I got to do it?

24:39.060 --> 24:40.228
You know, seniority.

24:40.312 --> 24:41.646
You got more experience
bending over.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.373
Check this out.

25:00.457 --> 25:02.918
A computer search
for the Gun Trace Task Force

25:02.918 --> 25:04.628
brought this up from Woodlawn.

25:04.628 --> 25:07.505
A 302, based
on information provided

25:07.589 --> 25:09.299
by Detective Ryan Guinn
of the BPD,

25:09.299 --> 25:11.927
who reported witnessing
a Detective Momodu Gondo,

25:11.927 --> 25:14.095
who he worked with
on the Gun Trace Task Force,

25:14.179 --> 25:17.891
and whose nickname is,
wait for it, G-Money.

25:17.891 --> 25:19.976
Goddamn.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.436
Guinn reported
witnessing Gondo

25:21.436 --> 25:23.438
in the company of Shropshire,
who Guinn knew to be

25:23.438 --> 25:25.941
a large-scale drug player
in Northeast Baltimore.

25:25.941 --> 25:30.237
Guinn describes the two men as,
quote, "very friendly," unquote.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.197
Later, Guinn said
that Gondo told him

25:32.197 --> 25:33.657
that Shropshire
and him grew up together

25:33.657 --> 25:35.075
and it was just talk
that Shropshire

25:35.075 --> 25:37.661
- was a drug dealer.
- Any follow-up by us?

25:37.661 --> 25:39.079
No, not that I can tell.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.081
This is all that came up
from the field office.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.415
Oh. Well, at least
the information

25:42.499 --> 25:45.502
was memorialized.
Okay, anything else?

25:45.502 --> 25:47.254
Well, only that I checked
and it seems

25:47.254 --> 25:50.966
that Gondo is still assigned
to the Gun Trace Task Force.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.133
Interesting.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.762
- You'll interview Guinn?
- On it.

25:59.307 --> 26:00.850
Yeah, this is Wise.

26:00.934 --> 26:01.977
What is this?

26:01.977 --> 26:03.270
Oh, yeah, that is for the...

26:03.270 --> 26:04.646
- It's Armani.
- Is it?

26:04.646 --> 26:07.816
I lied.
I was trying to impress you.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.150
- Oh, it worked.
- I know.

26:09.234 --> 26:12.195
I was at the stove
fixing plates.

26:12.279 --> 26:15.156
Kendal heard a noise
and went out back to check.

26:16.491 --> 26:20.328
Then we heard,
like, a machine gun go off.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.580
The children ran
to the hall closet.

26:22.664 --> 26:25.292
Kendal taught them to do that
because in June,

26:25.292 --> 26:27.961
a bullet came
through the window.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.088
I ran outside...

26:31.256 --> 26:33.341
he was lying on the ground.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.510
Did you see anyone else?

26:35.510 --> 26:38.763
Just Kendal in the alley.

26:40.515 --> 26:42.976
Do you have family coming?

26:44.102 --> 26:45.186
They're on the way.

26:46.855 --> 26:47.856
Can you go on?

26:49.816 --> 26:52.444
I saw a partially completed
fence out back.

26:52.444 --> 26:53.737
Can you tell me about that?

26:58.742 --> 27:01.161
All set.
Any problem, give me a call.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.871
You have authorization for 24/7,

27:02.871 --> 27:05.415
but if after the first month,
you wanna limit your time,

27:05.415 --> 27:07.917
- put it in the court report.
- Got it.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.213
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

27:12.297 --> 27:13.381
<i>You in Vegas?</i>

27:13.465 --> 27:16.009
<i>Yeah. Just got back to my hotel.</i>

27:16.009 --> 27:18.303
<i>Well, I'ma get my sugar
when you back.</i>

27:18.303 --> 27:19.387
<i>You'll get it.</i>

27:19.471 --> 27:21.181
<i>Ain't that
what the fuck I said?</i>

27:21.181 --> 27:22.390
<i>Ain't no question.</i>

27:22.474 --> 27:23.808
<i>Bye, baby. Later.</i>

27:23.892 --> 27:25.977
Cool, I think "sugar"
is code for coke.

27:30.357 --> 27:32.859
Girlfriend is non-pertinent.

27:32.859 --> 27:34.194
When things get boring
and you wanna

27:34.194 --> 27:35.653
second-guess the tap,
here's something

27:35.737 --> 27:37.864
Judge Quarles told me
that might help.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.825
"The bad guy has
to be perfect all the time,

27:40.909 --> 27:43.703
while all we have to be
is lucky, one time."

27:54.005 --> 27:55.840
DISPATCHER 2:
Ten-four, 2832.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.720
Sergeant Guinn?
That's me.

28:00.804 --> 28:04.682
- Special Agent Jensen, FBI.
- Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

28:05.308 --> 28:06.518
I'm sure you didn't, ah,

28:06.518 --> 28:08.895
and I have to tell you,
I dread this interview.

28:08.895 --> 28:10.480
Whoa! This doesn't sound good.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.690
It's just that we dropped
the ball back at The Bureau,

28:12.774 --> 28:14.484
and now I'm back.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.404
My report on Detective Gondo.

28:17.404 --> 28:18.738
Exactly.

28:18.822 --> 28:20.073
<i>Sergeant Janu,
call for you...</i>

28:20.073 --> 28:22.450
All right, but what happened
with all the secret-agent,

28:22.534 --> 28:25.078
- cloak-and-dagger stuff?
- The what?

28:25.078 --> 28:27.414
Two years ago,
when I called Woodlawn,

28:27.414 --> 28:30.375
an agent told me to wait outside
of Walters Art Gallery at...

28:30.375 --> 28:33.211
I forget what time, and I did.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.672
A van pulls up,
side door slides back

28:35.672 --> 28:37.632
and an agent waves me in.

28:37.632 --> 28:39.134
I mean, I thought
it was a little over-the-top...

28:39.134 --> 28:40.802
...but seeing
as you just walked in here

28:40.802 --> 28:43.471
like a normal pedestrian,
I know it was.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.806
Well, working back, the feeling,

28:44.806 --> 28:46.850
I guess,
is that the heat is off.

28:47.976 --> 28:49.644
But it isn't?

28:49.644 --> 28:51.396
Something happening
with Gondo now?

28:51.396 --> 28:53.773
Let's just say that if you could
revisit the concerns

28:53.857 --> 28:54.816
you had two years ago,

28:54.816 --> 28:56.276
it would be helpful.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.361
<i>Officer Boyd,
there's call for you on line 3.</i>

28:58.445 --> 28:59.779
<i>Boyd, call on line 3.</i>

28:59.863 --> 29:01.030
You know
that gut feeling you get

29:01.114 --> 29:02.949
when something ain't right?

29:02.949 --> 29:04.659
That's the feeling I got
when I saw

29:04.659 --> 29:06.661
Gondo and Shropshire together
at Mo's Seafood.

29:07.704 --> 29:09.456
It was that loose-vibe feel

29:09.456 --> 29:11.040
you get with two friends
at lunch.

29:11.124 --> 29:12.459
Now, I probably would've
let it slide

29:12.459 --> 29:15.128
but when Gondo ran me this line
on how Shropshire's cool,

29:15.128 --> 29:17.422
you know, a good guy
from the neighborhood,

29:17.422 --> 29:21.050
- a red flag went up.
- Did you say anything to Gondo?

29:21.134 --> 29:23.887
No. I mean, you can't help
where you grew up and all that,

29:23.887 --> 29:26.514
but...
...Gondo was playing it hard

29:26.598 --> 29:28.892
on how Shropshire
was a good guy,

29:28.892 --> 29:31.019
and that was some bullshit.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.480
I knew Shropshire
was moving weight, and...

29:33.480 --> 29:34.856
Gondo had to know that, too.

29:38.318 --> 29:40.987
You're calling
for Ron? Let me check.

29:42.405 --> 29:44.949
- Get that article I sent?
- Oh, it's right here.

29:46.242 --> 29:49.829
- Sean, right?
- Yeah, my name is Sean, Sarge.

29:51.331 --> 29:52.665
Looks like your vic
was a civilian.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.375
Well, worker and a family man.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.628
So this guy gets gunned down
for putting up a fence

29:56.628 --> 29:58.505
to keep drug dealers
from cutting through his yard?

29:59.506 --> 30:01.007
I don't know yet.

30:01.007 --> 30:03.635
Well, word from upstairs
is the commissioner

30:03.635 --> 30:05.053
and some City Hall pols
are headed over

30:05.053 --> 30:07.597
to Park Heights to finish
the fence for TV cameras.

30:07.597 --> 30:09.849
Yeah, I kinda
doubt the fence thing.

30:10.767 --> 30:12.143
He got shot five times.

30:12.227 --> 30:14.020
so shooter's maybe got
anger management issues

30:14.020 --> 30:17.315
- a little beyond a fence.
- Let it play as is.

30:17.315 --> 30:18.775
You never know,
maybe it moves somebody

30:18.775 --> 30:19.943
to call in a lead.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.487
Look, taxpayer murder

30:22.487 --> 30:25.365
rates a second detective
and you're new.

30:25.365 --> 30:26.866
You want somebody
with you on this?

30:29.577 --> 30:30.578
I'm good.

30:31.996 --> 30:33.081
All right.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.088
We got an outgoing.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.757
Yeah, I'm ready.

30:42.757 --> 30:44.926
<i>So, you still going,
or you back, or what?</i>

30:44.926 --> 30:46.719
<i>I'm back. We good?
I'm up.</i>

30:46.803 --> 30:47.762
Last coordinate?

30:47.762 --> 30:49.556
<i>Same spot?
Same spot.</i>

30:50.139 --> 30:51.099
<i>Later.</i>

30:53.226 --> 30:55.562
That's 443-212-9987.

30:55.562 --> 30:56.729
Short, sweet drug call.

30:56.813 --> 30:58.273
That's our fourth today.

30:58.898 --> 30:59.983
Yeah, I'm gonna check.

31:11.578 --> 31:12.829
Well, I'll be damned.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.163
Yeah, we've got
that number all over

31:14.247 --> 31:16.291
Shropshire's phone
in the records dump.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.459
A string of calls
going back two months.

31:20.503 --> 31:21.796
No, nothing fresh
on the tap yet.

31:21.796 --> 31:23.631
But, shit, we've only been up
for a couple days.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.967
So, uh, we'll keep
our eyes out for sure.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.052
Thanks.

31:30.263 --> 31:32.056
That was Erika.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.642
This number that's all over
Shropshire's call list?

31:36.185 --> 31:39.230
That's the mobile phone number
of Detective Momodu Gondo

31:39.314 --> 31:41.774
of the Baltimore
Police Department.

31:44.694 --> 31:47.780
Well, fuck me.

31:49.866 --> 31:52.619
So, you get that I'm with the
Civil Rights Division, right?

31:52.619 --> 31:55.163
I'm a fed, but I'm not
the kind of fed that,

31:55.163 --> 31:56.289
- you know...
- I get it.

31:56.289 --> 31:58.958
So I'm not chasing you
or anyone like you.

31:59.042 --> 32:02.462
I don't want you to snitch
or testify in court.

32:02.462 --> 32:04.130
I'm just trying
to write some truths

32:04.130 --> 32:06.257
about guys like Hersl,
same as you.

32:06.341 --> 32:08.426
I hear you,
but what you want me to say

32:08.426 --> 32:09.886
that I ain't already said?

32:09.886 --> 32:11.971
I mean, I put it
all out there in the song,

32:12.055 --> 32:14.098
and don't think
I ain't been made to pay for it.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.434
Soon as Hersl and his boys
heard that rap,

32:16.434 --> 32:17.935
they got on me even worse.

32:18.019 --> 32:21.856
- How?
- More harassment. More charges.

32:21.856 --> 32:24.317
Shit never ends.

32:24.317 --> 32:27.278
Is there anything else
you can tell me beyond the rap?

32:27.362 --> 32:28.613
Is there anything more?

32:28.613 --> 32:30.907
- He steals.
- Excuse me?

32:30.907 --> 32:33.368
Hersl steals.
He go into your pockets.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.328
You surprised?

32:35.328 --> 32:37.080
Shit. He ain't alone neither.

32:43.795 --> 32:44.879
Okay, bye.

32:49.801 --> 32:50.843
Hello?

32:50.927 --> 32:52.178
<i>This Miss Steele?</i>

32:52.178 --> 32:53.471
Yes, this is she.

32:53.471 --> 32:55.014
<i>My name
is Stanley Willis and--</i>

32:55.098 --> 32:56.224
How'd you get this number?

32:56.224 --> 32:58.559
<i>PD, ma'am. I'd like to
meet with you about an incident.</i>

32:58.643 --> 33:00.395
Where?
<i>My post.</i>

33:00.395 --> 33:02.563
<i>It's out on the west side,
near the beltway.</i>

33:13.950 --> 33:15.410
Shit. Well,
that didn't take long.

33:15.410 --> 33:16.452
What's that?

33:16.536 --> 33:18.621
Looks like Shropshire
found our tracker.

33:19.122 --> 33:19.997
Where?

33:20.081 --> 33:21.416
GPS shows Baltimore City,

33:21.416 --> 33:23.626
down on 25th Street,
near Loch Raven.

33:23.710 --> 33:25.753
There's a bunch
of auto shops down there.

33:27.547 --> 33:28.756
Look, look, it's Gondo.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.926
Fuck me, he's calling Gondo.

33:34.345 --> 33:35.596
<i>Hello?</i>

33:35.680 --> 33:37.056
<i>Yo,</i> papi?

33:37.140 --> 33:38.057
What's up, bro?

33:38.141 --> 33:39.392
<i>What's good with you?</i>

33:39.392 --> 33:41.436
Nothin', man. You know Philly.

33:41.436 --> 33:43.896
<i>You in Philly, huh?</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:43.980 --> 33:45.565
<i>Well, I got a question for you.</i>

33:45.565 --> 33:46.566
I'm listening.

33:46.566 --> 33:48.901
<i>I took the car to the shop.</i>

33:48.985 --> 33:50.611
The thing is lit, yo.
They pulled it off.

33:50.695 --> 33:51.821
<i>Okay.</i>

33:51.821 --> 33:53.239
What do I do with it?

33:53.239 --> 33:55.992
<i>Aye, yo, just run that
by me one more time.</i>

33:55.992 --> 33:57.326
You know what I'm talking about?

33:57.410 --> 33:58.745
<i>Yeah, nigga. Let me think.</i>

33:58.745 --> 34:01.122
All right.

34:02.749 --> 34:05.293
<i>Yo, this an iPhone?
Yeah.</i>

34:05.293 --> 34:06.627
<i>Just FaceTime me, yo.</i>

34:07.712 --> 34:08.963
<i>All right.
All right.</i>

34:09.047 --> 34:10.631
All right.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.508
I'm gonna call Leo and Erika.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.093
They need to know
that we caught Gondo

34:14.177 --> 34:15.386
on the hook with Shropshire.

34:15.470 --> 34:17.138
I wonder why Gondo
took half a conversation

34:17.138 --> 34:18.765
to tell Brill to call him
on FaceTime?

34:18.765 --> 34:20.141
He knows we can't track
those calls.

34:20.141 --> 34:21.726
Why does he
talk on the phone at all?

34:21.726 --> 34:24.645
He got sloppy? We got lucky.

34:29.609 --> 34:31.277
Look,
he was an innocent person

34:31.277 --> 34:32.862
trying to protect his children.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.072
Okay. This is a devastating
crime for the family.

34:36.157 --> 34:39.285
Mr. Fenwick was a family man,
a good man,

34:39.285 --> 34:41.370
a community leader and a friend.

34:41.454 --> 34:43.039
And this was his home,
and he was murdered

34:43.039 --> 34:44.957
in broad daylight,
just a few yards

34:45.041 --> 34:47.043
from his property
while building a fence...

34:48.377 --> 34:49.587
Quite a show up the block.

34:51.047 --> 34:52.131
I guess it's that.

34:53.341 --> 34:55.593
All about the murder.
- Guess so.

34:56.719 --> 34:58.012
Yeah, that's my problem.

34:58.096 --> 35:01.307
I'm the detective
that got assigned the case.

35:01.307 --> 35:03.893
If anyone hears anything
that belongs in my ear,

35:04.602 --> 35:05.937
I can keep a confidence.

35:09.482 --> 35:10.983
Nice.

35:11.067 --> 35:13.528
You don't see too many of these
in this kind of condition.

35:14.278 --> 35:15.446
It's a '94?

35:15.530 --> 35:16.656
Ninety-five.

35:16.656 --> 35:18.658
SS only came
in black the first year.

35:18.658 --> 35:22.411
Added Cherry Metallic year two.
Family man's 'Vette.

35:22.495 --> 35:24.038
How many kids you got?

35:24.038 --> 35:25.164
Three. You?

35:25.873 --> 35:27.291
Five.

35:27.375 --> 35:30.044
Got me beat.
- I'm buried, brother.

35:32.672 --> 35:34.882
You'd do well
to put that Bud in a bag.

35:36.342 --> 35:37.552
I'll think on it.

35:38.803 --> 35:39.846
Stay safe.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.231
Mm-hmm.

35:51.107 --> 35:52.900
Yeah.

35:52.984 --> 35:53.943
Uh-huh.

35:55.361 --> 35:57.822
- Hey, Dave, they're back up.
- I'll call you back.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.159
<i>Hello?</i>

36:02.243 --> 36:03.452
<i>Yeah, basically</i>

36:03.536 --> 36:05.371

happens on the other side,</i>

36:05.371 --> 36:07.123
<i>it's just a loss. You feel me?</i>

36:07.123 --> 36:10.334
<i>Right. Right.
Definitely, definitely,</i>

36:10.418 --> 36:12.253
<i>somebody's been
tracking you. So...</i>

36:12.253 --> 36:13.754
<i>Ain't no question.</i>

36:13.838 --> 36:15.673
<i>I'ma pop it
on somebody else's car,</i>

36:15.673 --> 36:17.425
<i>like a working-folk car.</i>

36:17.425 --> 36:19.218
<i>You know, I don't
even know who I'm talking to,</i>

36:19.302 --> 36:20.344
<i>so whatever you do...</i>

36:20.428 --> 36:21.929
<i>...you do, but just be mindful.</i>

36:22.013 --> 36:24.181
<i>Just be mindful of that, Brill.
So, whatever you do...</i>

36:24.265 --> 36:25.725
<i>Right.</i>

36:25.725 --> 36:27.894
<i>But, yeah, you definitely
gotta get rid of it, aight?</i>

36:27.894 --> 36:29.020
<i>Aight.</i>

36:29.020 --> 36:30.438
<i>Aight.
Bye.</i>

36:30.438 --> 36:32.064
Thank you, Officer Gondo.

36:32.148 --> 36:34.108
"I don't even know
who I'm talking to?"

36:34.192 --> 36:36.986
Like, what the fuck?

36:46.996 --> 36:49.373
Uh, no offense,
but can I see ID?

36:49.457 --> 36:52.168
Oh. Yeah. There you go.

36:52.168 --> 36:54.128
- Mm. Yeah.
- I guess I haven't

36:54.128 --> 36:55.463
learned enough about Baltimore.

36:55.463 --> 36:57.006
I didn't know
this place existed.

36:57.006 --> 37:01.135
Yeah, Leakin Park. Me neither,
till I was assigned the post.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.428
It's one of those
they usually give

37:02.428 --> 37:04.263
to the burnouts or the OGs.

37:04.347 --> 37:05.806
And I'm guessing you're neither.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.975
- I got a big mouth.
- Oh.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.102
Would I get your name
and call you otherwise?

37:11.228 --> 37:12.313
Like an idiot...

37:12.313 --> 37:13.773
...I made it clear
to my sergeant,

37:13.773 --> 37:15.441
my lieutenant, even my major,

37:15.441 --> 37:17.777
that I don't like the way
we go about policing.

37:17.777 --> 37:21.906
So here I am, 32-years-old,
and out to pasture.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.574
But a lot of guys feel like me.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.326
We've seen things going on

37:25.326 --> 37:26.702
that'll blow your mind.

37:27.662 --> 37:28.955
Like this, for example.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.000
This happened a few weeks ago.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.544
Young man
by the name of Samuels.

37:35.628 --> 37:38.255
Reginald Samuels.
And I wanted you all to know,

37:38.339 --> 37:40.633
that even with you people
in town, looking into our mess,

37:40.633 --> 37:43.928
this shit still goes on.
Like we can't help ourselves.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.722
- Why not?
- It's a numbers game.

37:46.806 --> 37:49.350
Squad's numbers were down,
Sergeant wasn't happy.

37:49.350 --> 37:51.352
So we got our marching orders.

37:51.352 --> 37:52.603
Bring in bodies.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.522
I mean, this happens
in every district,

37:54.522 --> 37:56.357
every day, year after year.

37:56.357 --> 37:59.568
Less now after Freddie Gray,
but that's only because the guys

37:59.652 --> 38:01.612
won't get out of their cars
to spite Mosby.

38:04.407 --> 38:06.409

38:06.409 --> 38:07.576

38:12.415 --> 38:13.624

to fix this.

- I'm not getting on no wall.

- There's always one. Watch 'em.
- We don't listen to no fuckin' police.

38:40.234 --> 38:41.819

and lace your fingers.

- I'm cool. You cool?

38:45.698 --> 38:48.117

for the stats,

41:27.902 --> 41:29.111
Ain't that the truth. Yeah.
Fuck yes.

41:29.195 --> 41:31.238
I want you to eat
something now, man. Go on.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.406
I spent 46 bucks

41:32.406 --> 41:33.699
- on those crabs.
- I know.

41:33.699 --> 41:35.242
I'm just saying it's a waste
of fucking money, you know?

41:35.326 --> 41:36.535
They look good to me.

41:36.619 --> 41:38.078
- I'll eat the crabs.
- They're gonna sit there

41:38.162 --> 41:39.371
just fucking collect flies
or whatever.

41:39.455 --> 41:41.373
No, I'll eat them,
then we'll take them home.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.168
Hey.
- They just--

41:44.168 --> 41:47.254
Look at me. Relax, you're okay.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.715
Man, you know
those things are bad for you.

41:49.715 --> 41:52.009
SUSPECT 1: Like you
give a fuck about that.

41:53.177 --> 41:54.220
SUSPECT 1: Come on, man.

41:54.803 --> 41:55.930
Found a ground-stash

41:55.930 --> 41:58.265
in that vacant lot over there.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.767
Who does it belong to?

42:01.018 --> 42:03.437
All of them.

42:03.437 --> 42:06.482
Hey, come on. They all go.

42:06.482 --> 42:08.192
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go, fellas.

42:08.192 --> 42:10.319
You're going
for a ride, let's go.

42:10.319 --> 42:11.528
Come on, big boy.

42:11.612 --> 42:13.072
Come on, y'all.
We're just going on a road trip.

42:13.072 --> 42:15.366
I taught you well, Jenks.

42:15.366 --> 42:17.826
Oh, it's gonna be fun.
What you-- Say it with me.

42:17.910 --> 42:19.245
"Road trip, road trip!"

42:19.245 --> 42:20.788
Y'all gonna be crowded
in there. It's gonna be fun.

42:20.788 --> 42:22.248
Come on.
Put a fucking smile

42:22.248 --> 42:24.250
on your face, for fuck's sake.
Road trip, road trip.

42:24.250 --> 42:26.085
One thing I don't understand...

42:26.085 --> 42:28.420
If police work has become
this indiscriminate,

42:28.504 --> 42:30.506
if anyone
and everyone in the city

42:30.506 --> 42:33.842
can get locked up for anything,
who talks to you now?

42:33.926 --> 42:35.052
To the departments,

42:35.052 --> 42:36.303
if you need witnesses...

42:36.387 --> 42:38.973
- ...if you need informants?
- It's worse than that.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.100
- Tell me.
- Uh...

42:41.100 --> 42:44.061
Sure, you can talk to the guys
in Homicide or Robbery.

42:44.061 --> 42:45.354
Used to be
that every now and then,

42:45.354 --> 42:47.231
the phone would ring,
someone would drop a dime

42:47.231 --> 42:50.025
on who shot Tater,
or who robbed the Rite Aid.

42:50.109 --> 42:51.068
- Right.
- Not anymore.

42:51.068 --> 42:53.362
You got that right enough.

42:53.362 --> 42:55.155
But now, even if
you find the witnesses

42:55.239 --> 42:57.866
and you make a case,
now when you need to get

42:57.950 --> 42:59.910
twelve people
together to make a jury,

42:59.994 --> 43:01.829
twelve people to believe
that you aren't lying

43:01.829 --> 43:03.372
on the witness stand about

43:03.372 --> 43:05.457
who shot Tater
or who robbed the Rite Aid,

43:05.541 --> 43:08.335
they look at you, and remember
when some other cop

43:08.419 --> 43:10.462
lied on them,
or their son or brother.

43:10.546 --> 43:12.381
Mm. I mean, the lawyers
will tell you we lost

43:12.381 --> 43:13.924
the city juries
doing this stuff.

43:14.008 --> 43:15.676
- Mm.
- They think police just lie.

43:15.676 --> 43:17.094
Because now you do.

43:19.179 --> 43:20.180
Now we do.

43:23.976 --> 43:26.353
So, tell me
about this Samuels kid.

43:26.437 --> 43:29.189
I wasn't involved.

43:29.273 --> 43:33.319
But I was on the scene
running backup on the call.

43:33.319 --> 43:35.321
<i>And this one here
stuck in my mind.</i>

43:35.321 --> 43:37.781
<i>I got a nephew that boy's age.</i>

43:45.998 --> 43:48.917
You got ID?

43:49.001 --> 43:50.044
I just came back from work!

43:50.044 --> 43:51.378
Why the fuck
are you stopping me?

43:51.462 --> 43:53.464
You're in a high-crime area,
wearing a hooded sweatshirt.

43:53.464 --> 43:54.757
You stopped me
for wearing a hoodie?

43:54.757 --> 43:56.216
Something subtle.
You had your head on a swivel.

43:56.300 --> 43:57.676
Looked like you were seeking
a victim of opportunity.

43:57.760 --> 44:00.054
I had to look both ways
so I didn't get hit by no car!

44:00.054 --> 44:01.555
Bro, ain't nobody here but me.

44:01.555 --> 44:02.931
OFFICER 1:
I'm gonna pat you down.

44:03.015 --> 44:04.850
- For what? I-- Bro!
- Hey, hey, easy, easy.

44:04.850 --> 44:05.976
Let the man do his job.

44:06.060 --> 44:07.311
- Easy, easy, easy.
- I'm not doing shit, bro.

44:07.311 --> 44:09.229
OFFICER 2: Chill, ease up,
ease up. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

44:09.313 --> 44:11.190
Y'all got
nothing else better to do?
I'm not doing nothing.

44:11.190 --> 44:12.816
OFFICER 2: You ain't
doing nothing. You good. Chill.

44:12.900 --> 44:14.026
OFFICER 1:
Looks like a rigged knife.

44:14.026 --> 44:15.569
I gotta walk home
at night sometimes.

44:15.569 --> 44:18.322
You said it your own self,
it's a high-crime area.

44:18.322 --> 44:20.991
Another smartass.
Cuff this little motherfucker.

44:21.075 --> 44:24.453
Wait, I didn't do nothing, bro.
Bro, why you cuffing me, bro?

44:24.453 --> 44:27.539
- OFFICER 3: Hey. You got it.
- Bro, I didn't do shit. What are you doing?

44:27.623 --> 44:29.583
What am I doing wrong?
I'm not doing nothing wrong.

44:29.583 --> 44:31.126
Shut up! You're doing
everything wrong right now.

44:31.210 --> 44:32.586
I was walking
across the fucking street!

44:32.586 --> 44:34.922
I'm not doing nothing, bro!

44:34.922 --> 44:36.173
Fuck you, asshole!

44:37.633 --> 44:39.927
<i>That mess got
out of hand so fast.</i>

44:42.096 --> 44:43.305
For real.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.185
Do you think
Samuels will talk to me?

44:49.228 --> 44:50.354
You could try.

45:07.413 --> 45:09.081
You need me,
I'll be with Ballistics.

45:09.081 --> 45:11.041
You get in on something?

45:11.125 --> 45:12.501
Well, stay on it.

45:16.296 --> 45:18.632
What did they do to you
when you were on the ground?

45:20.676 --> 45:22.469
Whatever they wanted.

45:22.553 --> 45:25.931
Beat me all over.
Stoned me in my face, too.

45:26.849 --> 45:28.642
You spent the night
in detention?

45:29.768 --> 45:31.478
Lucky I wasn't
on the schedule that day.

45:31.562 --> 45:33.147
I would've lost my job.

45:42.531 --> 45:45.492
I got 12 of these,
gonna leave a scar.

45:47.119 --> 45:48.787
You think it's gonna
ruin me for the girls?

45:49.788 --> 45:51.457
I'm guessing
you'll be all right.

45:57.045 --> 45:59.006
<i>Looking at this list
of robberies</i>

45:59.006 --> 46:00.674
and thefts of confiscated funds,

46:00.674 --> 46:03.594
I didn't see
Detective John Clewell's name

46:03.594 --> 46:05.762
- anywhere on it.
- Clewell.

46:05.846 --> 46:08.265
Out of all the officers
in the GTTF,

46:08.265 --> 46:11.226
- he's the only one.
- Choir boy?

46:11.310 --> 46:14.021
No,
that fool was straight.

46:14.021 --> 46:16.982
I don't even know
how the fuck he got in the unit,

46:16.982 --> 46:18.150
to be honest.

46:19.401 --> 46:22.446
Probably Allers brought him
from Southern, or some shit.

46:22.446 --> 46:25.240
Just to confirm,
this is Sergeant Allers,

46:25.324 --> 46:28.577
supervisor,
now with the DEA Task Force?

46:32.206 --> 46:37.586
That right there is M.
That's G, and that's A.

46:38.795 --> 46:40.297
It's me, Gondo, and Allers.

46:43.217 --> 46:45.010
Allers also stole money
with you?

46:45.010 --> 46:47.387
Yes, ma'am. He did.

46:49.014 --> 46:50.390
Oh, shit. So...

46:50.474 --> 46:53.477
So you think because Allers
was a sergeant, he was immune?

46:54.811 --> 46:56.563
Sergeants and lieutenants
got to do admin work,

46:56.647 --> 46:58.398
and guess what?
They don't make overtime

46:58.482 --> 47:01.235
on them office hours. So they're
hungrier for their share

47:01.235 --> 47:03.195
of whatever cash we pull.

47:03.195 --> 47:05.197
Jenkins didn't invent anything.

47:06.198 --> 47:08.492
This shit been goin' on
for a long while.

47:09.493 --> 47:10.410
Um, Officer Rayam,

47:10.494 --> 47:12.412
can you clear
something else up for us?

47:12.955 --> 47:13.872
Happy to help.

47:13.956 --> 47:16.333

47:18.669 --> 47:20.879
time working plainclothes. Wow.

47:20.963 --> 47:23.131
That must have taken a while.

47:24.299 --> 47:26.510
Do you recall
lying to investigators

47:26.510 --> 47:30.055
and failing a polygraph
relative to a 2009 incident

47:30.055 --> 47:32.349
where 11,000 dollars was stolen?

47:32.933 --> 47:35.102
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

47:35.102 --> 47:38.063

we can't have that, right?

49:05.734 --> 49:06.693
Yup.

49:06.777 --> 49:08.654
You were with him
in the Academy.

49:08.654 --> 49:09.905
That's right.

49:09.905 --> 49:12.866
Did IAD ever confront you
on that lie?

49:12.866 --> 49:15.702
Well, they didn't charge me.

49:16.703 --> 49:18.664
And, uh,
according to this report,

49:18.664 --> 49:21.541
in the four months
before and after this incident,

49:21.625 --> 49:25.379
you called him 474 times.

49:25.379 --> 49:28.965
Yeah, I did.
Look, I didn't think they were

49:29.049 --> 49:31.343
smart enough
to, uh, pull my phone records.

49:33.428 --> 49:36.223
But y'all were. Weren't you?

49:38.767 --> 49:40.394
You know what, check this out.

49:40.394 --> 49:43.605
Couple months later,
they set up an integrity sting.

49:44.564 --> 49:46.358
They wanted
to catch Sly knocking off

49:46.358 --> 49:47.734
some cadet playing undercover.

49:47.818 --> 49:50.529
My man took, like,
seventy bucks in marked bills,

49:50.529 --> 49:54.700
and when they popped his locker,
they found coke.

49:54.700 --> 49:59.204
But IAD fucked that simple
shit up so bad...

49:59.204 --> 50:01.623
State's Attorney's Office
had to drop the charges.

50:03.542 --> 50:06.378
So even though
they had me dead up,

50:06.378 --> 50:10.590
because I blew
the fucking box, get this.

50:10.674 --> 50:16.012
They only suspended me.
For two years. With pay.

50:18.473 --> 50:23.270
And when they reinstated me,
me, they put me in a unit

50:23.270 --> 50:25.063
made up of a bunch
of the biggest crooks

50:25.147 --> 50:26.982

What'd he do?

52:12.963 --> 52:13.964
Told him the corner
was indicted.

52:13.964 --> 52:15.215
He's still here
when we rolled back.

52:15.215 --> 52:16.842
Man, that shit hurt.
- Damn.

52:16.842 --> 52:18.385
Well, you fucked him up
pretty good.

52:18.385 --> 52:19.761
Fuck you, man.

52:19.845 --> 52:21.054
What's the charge on him?

52:21.054 --> 52:23.139
Loitering in a drug-free zone.

52:23.223 --> 52:25.100
- Failure to obey.
- Considering the damage,

52:25.100 --> 52:27.727
I think maybe you wanna add
resisting to that, yeah?

52:27.811 --> 52:28.979
Say he swung on you.

52:28.979 --> 52:31.189
We're all good here.
- Hey, dumb-dumb!

52:32.607 --> 52:34.776
Never swing on a cop. Okay?

52:34.860 --> 52:36.695
Know what I mean?

52:51.710 --> 52:52.669
OFFICER 1: <i>Jenks!</i>

52:52.669 --> 52:54.004
<i>You're field training
the new guy.</i>

52:54.004 --> 52:55.589
<i>Fuck me.</i>

52:55.589 --> 52:58.258
<i>Whose daughter did I ass fuck
to get this job?</i>

52:58.258 --> 53:00.135
OFFICER 1: <i>Yeah, fuck you.</i>

53:06.308 --> 53:07.517
What's going on, man?

53:08.101 --> 53:09.185
You Yang?

53:10.353 --> 53:11.897
Yeah. You can call me Tim.

53:11.897 --> 53:16.318
Okay. Hmm. I'm Jenkins.
You ride with me, I'm your FTO.

53:17.652 --> 53:19.154
Shift attention!

53:21.364 --> 53:22.532
All right, relax, guys.

53:23.658 --> 53:25.035
- For anyone who hasn't heard...
- Go on, sit down.

53:25.035 --> 53:27.579
...Constant took an ambulance
out of here last night

53:27.579 --> 53:28.580
and was admitted

53:28.580 --> 53:29.748
to Union Memorial.

53:29.748 --> 53:31.249
Some kind of heart disease.

53:31.333 --> 53:33.877
I don't know, but he's stable
and he's gonna live. If you...

53:33.877 --> 53:36.296
First off, all that shit
you learned in the Academy?

53:36.296 --> 53:37.505
Fuck all that.

53:38.715 --> 53:40.133
This is Baltimore.

53:40.133 --> 53:42.594
OFFICER 2:
Man, I served a warrant
on that guy last week.

53:42.594 --> 53:44.220
Yeah, okay, well,

53:44.304 --> 53:46.598
let's look into him.

54:20.840 --> 54:22.717
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

54:23.760 --> 54:24.886
Yeah. You're the guys

54:24.970 --> 54:27.389
who've come to tell us
how to police Baltimore, hmm?

54:27.389 --> 54:29.933
Well...

54:29.933 --> 54:33.144
Hey. I finally get to meet
one of you guys.

54:33.228 --> 54:37.357
- Glad to meet you, too. May I?
- Yeah, sure. You want a drink?

54:37.357 --> 54:39.317
I'm good.

54:39.401 --> 54:41.069
So what do you want from me?

54:41.069 --> 54:44.322
Uh... I just thought
it was time that we met.

54:44.406 --> 54:47.492
- I could use your insight.
- Yeah. About what?

54:47.492 --> 54:50.996
Well, you have an impressive
number of complaints with IAD.

54:52.163 --> 54:55.000
- Forty-six by my count.
- Only one sustained.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.418
But given
the number, it's--

54:56.418 --> 54:58.712
Ma'am, do you know
what the Baltimore cops

54:58.712 --> 55:00.922
who don't have complaints
are doing every day?

55:01.923 --> 55:02.924
No.

55:03.800 --> 55:05.593
They sure as hell
ain't policing.

55:05.677 --> 55:06.553
Hmm.

55:06.553 --> 55:07.804
'Cause if you wanna do this job,

55:07.804 --> 55:10.223
then you're gonna get complaints
for doing this job.

55:10.223 --> 55:13.018
So what you're saying--
I'm saying the reason

55:13.018 --> 55:14.811
so many complaints
are unsustained

55:14.811 --> 55:16.312
is 'cause they're coming
from criminals

55:16.396 --> 55:18.481
who are being policed
for doing crime.

55:19.607 --> 55:21.192
And that's all I have to say.

55:22.193 --> 55:24.612
- Hey, Tommy. Yo.
- Danny.

55:24.696 --> 55:26.531
What's up, cap?
Hey, Joey,

55:26.531 --> 55:28.366
Get Tommy there, uh,
his first two on me.

55:28.450 --> 55:29.993
I owe him a good time.

55:31.619 --> 55:33.830
I don't have any other comment
for you beyond that, ma'am.

55:33.830 --> 55:35.498
But you have a fine day.

55:37.625 --> 55:40.378
Officer, I'm not a prosecutor.

55:40.462 --> 55:41.880
I'm just trying
to learn about the city

55:41.880 --> 55:44.132
and the policing here
to write a report.

55:44.132 --> 55:47.469
This is not a criminal
investigation of any kind.

55:47.469 --> 55:49.471
Mm-hmm.

55:49.471 --> 55:52.182
Ma'am, you have a great day.

56:07.739 --> 56:09.824
