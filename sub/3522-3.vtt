03:03.116 --> 03:05.118

grandmother's
house?

03:05.618 --> 03:06.619
It wasn't my fault.

03:06.619 --> 03:08.121
If i had a quarter for
every time i heard that

03:08.621 --> 03:09.622
since you learned
how to talk,

03:09.622 --> 03:12.125
i'd have a private jet
on 24- hour stand- by.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.627
Get in the car.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.138
In your
grandmother's house.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.140
Now, who's

03:27.140 --> 03:29.642
You're just lu

03:29.642 --> 03:31.144
So he cut me
a favor.

03:31.144 --> 03:33.646
Let me guess,
he owes you money?

03:44.657 --> 03:46.159
Are you gonna tell me
what she did?

03:46.159 --> 03:47.160
Go upstairs.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.661
No, i wanna se

03:48.661 --> 03:51.164
Anthony jr. , get your
little ass up those stairs.

03:52.665 --> 03:53.666
Meadow...

03:53.666 --> 03:55.168
we can talk about it
in the morning.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.669
Get down here!

03:56.669 --> 03:57.670
Let her
go to bed.

03:57.670 --> 03:58.671
Let her go to bed?

03:58.671 --> 04:00.173
I want her to
answer for herself!

04:00.173 --> 04:01.174
She's drunk!

04:01.174 --> 04:02.175
Was she driving
like this?

04:02.675 --> 04:04.677
I could have taken
ecstasy but i didn't!

04:04.677 --> 04:06.679
Don't puke on the floor!

04:06.679 --> 04:08.181
What are you doing up?
Go to bed!

04:08.681 --> 04:10.683
She fools around with ecstasy
and you yell at me?

04:10.683 --> 04:12.685
Get up there!

04:15.188 --> 04:18.190
So, what did she h
ave to say for herself?

04:18.190 --> 04:21.694
The usual shit,
"wasn't my fault."

04:21.694 --> 04:23.696
There was design
er drugs there, tony.

04:23.696 --> 04:26.199
So, what did you say?

04:26.199 --> 04:28.701
I don't know,
i yelled.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.204
What the fuck else
am i gonna do?

04:38.211 --> 04:41.214
You sure you're gonn
a be alright, uncle rich?

04:41.214 --> 04:43.216
I wanna walk.

04:43.216 --> 04:46.219
See if i run into
any of the old crowd.

04:46.219 --> 04:48.721
Thanks, doll.

05:02.735 --> 05:04.737
Er.
Motherfuck

05:12.245 --> 05:14.747
there has to be
consequences.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.749
What kind of
parents would we be

05:16.749 --> 05:18.751
if we let her
get away with this?

05:18.751 --> 05:20.753
Typical.

05:20.753 --> 05:22.255
Ip.
Plenty of parents
still crack the wh

05:22.255 --> 05:24.757
yeah, that's what
they tell you.

05:24.757 --> 05:28.261
I cannot wait unti
l she goes off to college.

05:28.261 --> 05:29.762
Oh, right, so you
can be fucked up

05:29.762 --> 05:31.264
with the empty nest
syndrome,

05:31.264 --> 05:34.267
and go on wellbutrin
like your sister.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.269
As a parent today,

05:36.269 --> 05:39.772
you are over a bar
rel no matter what you do.

05:39.772 --> 05:42.275
You take away the car,
you become her chauffeurs.

05:42.275 --> 05:43.776
You ground her,

05:43.776 --> 05:44.777
you gotta stay
home weekends

05:45.278 --> 05:46.279
ds.
And be prison guar

05:46.279 --> 05:47.280
we could
throw her out,

05:47.280 --> 05:48.781
but social services
would bring her back,

05:49.282 --> 05:51.284
and then we'd be
in front of the judge,
she's not 18 yet.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.286
That's your solution,
to throw your daughter out?

05:53.286 --> 05:55.288
All i'm saying,
with the laws today,

05:55.288 --> 05:57.290
you can't even restrain
your kid physically,

05:57.290 --> 06:00.793
'cause she can sue you
for child abuse.

06:00.793 --> 06:03.296
There has to be
consequences.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.798
And, there will be,
i hear you, okay?

06:05.798 --> 06:07.800
Let's not
over- play our hand.

06:08.301 --> 06:09.802
'Cause if she finds out
we're powerless,

06:09.802 --> 06:11.304
we're fucked.

06:24.317 --> 06:26.319
Jesus, mothe
r of christ!

06:26.319 --> 06:28.821
Richie, so,
when'd you get out?

06:28.821 --> 06:30.323
How come nobody told me?

06:31.324 --> 06:32.825
Well, it's funny.

06:32.825 --> 06:35.328
Paulie walnuts told me
he ran into you this morning.

06:35.328 --> 06:38.831
Hey, honest
to fucking god
, nobody said a word.

06:38.831 --> 06:40.833
Just shut
the fuck up.

06:45.338 --> 06:48.841
I did a lot of meditation
in the can on this.

06:48.841 --> 06:53.846
You can't believe how
clear you can see things.

06:53.846 --> 06:55.848
Do you ever
meditate?

06:55.848 --> 06:57.850
Me, meditate?
Are you crazy?

06:57.850 --> 06:59.852
Not as crazy
as i used to be.

06:59.852 --> 07:03.356
But still crazy enough
to take an eye out.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.358
What's going
on here, rich?

07:05.358 --> 07:07.360
Ten years, and
not even a pleasant

07:07.360 --> 07:09.862
"go fuck yourself",
from you i get.

07:09.862 --> 07:12.365
I always asked
how you were doing.

07:14.367 --> 07:15.868
Hold on there, you.

07:15.868 --> 07:18.871
How could you let
my dear friend sit here

07:18.871 --> 07:20.373
with an empt
y cup of coffee?

07:20.373 --> 07:23.376
That's alright,
take it easy, kid.

07:23.376 --> 07:26.879
Bring this gentleman
a nice veal- parm sandwich.

07:26.879 --> 07:28.881
And hurry the fuck
up about it.

07:28.881 --> 07:31.384
The other two stores
doing as good as this?

07:31.884 --> 07:34.887
Come on, you know
it's a grind.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.393
That doesn't answer
my question.

07:42.895 --> 07:44.897
Uy.
Hey, look, rich,
i know you're a made g

07:44.897 --> 07:46.399
so, i lose either way.

07:46.399 --> 07:48.401
I always respected you
and your brother jackie.

07:48.901 --> 07:50.403
I'm no victim here.

07:50.403 --> 07:53.406
I'm not some
greaseball store owner.

07:53.906 --> 07:56.909
I'm sorry, richie,
i will not be
shaken down.

07:56.909 --> 08:00.413
Sucking up to tony soprano
has done wonders for you.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.915
I go away for a while,
i come back,

08:02.915 --> 08:05.418
you're a tough guy.

08:05.418 --> 08:06.419
Don't do this.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.420
Don't do what?

08:07.420 --> 08:08.921
Take what's
owed to me?

08:08.921 --> 08:09.922
What's owed to you?

08:09.922 --> 08:11.924
I put you in action,
beansie.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.928
You got a bad
memory, beansie.

08:18.931 --> 08:21.934
Veal parmigiana
sandwich...

08:21.934 --> 08:23.936
fuck you.

08:25.938 --> 08:28.941
I'll be back every
saturday, partner.

08:28.941 --> 08:30.943
I don't fucking believ
e what i'm hearing here.

08:30.943 --> 08:32.945
I'm being shak
en down for what?

08:32.945 --> 08:35.448
What did i do,
tell me, what did i do?

08:35.448 --> 08:36.948
This is not
right, richie,

08:36.948 --> 08:38.451
wn.
I'm not gonna
fucking lay do

08:38.951 --> 08:40.453
up.
I'll step

08:51.964 --> 08:53.466
you won't
lay down, huh?

08:53.466 --> 08:54.967
You won't lay down?

08:54.967 --> 08:57.470
You piece of shit!

09:00.973 --> 09:02.475
Alright, let's get
her down here.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.477
I guess.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.479
Where is the bride
of frankenstein?

09:06.479 --> 09:07.480
She's still
sleeping.

09:07.980 --> 09:10.483
Yeah, alright,
go wake her up.

09:10.483 --> 09:11.984
I wake her up?

09:11.984 --> 09:14.487
Yeah, i wanna get this
shit out of the way

09:14.487 --> 09:15.988
before i go out.

09:15.988 --> 09:18.491
Let her sleep, you guy
s are making too much of this.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.992
Oh, no, i don't think
we're making enough.

09:19.992 --> 09:20.993
She was drunk.

09:20.993 --> 09:22.495
Her choice.

09:22.495 --> 09:23.996
There's a zuni
saying:

09:23.996 --> 09:25.998
For every 20 wrongs
a child does,

09:25.998 --> 09:26.999
ignore 19.

09:26.999 --> 09:28.501
There's an old
italian saying:

09:28.501 --> 09:30.002
You fuck up once
, lose two teeth.

09:30.002 --> 09:31.003
See?

09:31.003 --> 09:33.005
That's what all
this is about.

09:33.005 --> 09:34.507
Ego and control.

09:35.007 --> 09:36.509
I beg your pardon?

09:36.509 --> 09:37.510
No, please, please,

09:37.510 --> 09:39.011
don't try to mak
e sense with her.

09:39.011 --> 09:40.012
No, i wanna
understand this.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.014
Go ahead, tell me.

09:42.014 --> 09:44.517
You want to hold onto control
over a young woman

09:45.017 --> 09:47.520
whose entire
biological determinism

09:47.520 --> 09:50.022
is to achieve independent
thought and behavior.

09:50.022 --> 09:52.024
And because she's
exercised her independence,

09:52.525 --> 09:54.026
you wanna penalize her

09:54.026 --> 09:56.028
because you don't
agree with her choices.

09:56.028 --> 09:58.531
Why don't you go and g
et a fuckin' permanent?

09:58.531 --> 10:00.533
I'm tryin'
to watch tv!

10:03.536 --> 10:04.537
Ll.
We

10:07.540 --> 10:09.041
good morning.

10:09.041 --> 10:11.043
Oh, i'm sorry,
it's afternoon.

10:11.043 --> 10:12.044
Mom, please.

10:12.044 --> 10:13.546
Please, what?

10:13.546 --> 10:15.548
You better have
some answers, young lady.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.550
Yeah, that's right.

10:20.052 --> 10:22.054
Okay, fine,
you're punished.

10:22.054 --> 10:24.056
For what, i didn't
do anything!

10:24.056 --> 10:26.058
You call what you did
to grandma's house
nothin'?

10:26.058 --> 10:27.059
It wasn't my fault!

10:27.059 --> 10:28.561
It's never your
fault, meadow.

10:29.061 --> 10:30.062
It was just
supposed to be

10:30.062 --> 10:31.564
me, hunter and
the macaluso twins,

10:31.564 --> 10:34.066
and then steve shows up
with his asshole friend, adam,

10:34.066 --> 10:35.568
and a bunch of people
from boonton.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.570
Oh, so, steve's just walking
around trying doorknobs

10:37.570 --> 10:39.071
'til he hi
ts the jackpot?

10:39.071 --> 10:41.073
No, hunter goe
s and tells him.

10:41.073 --> 10:42.074
Oh, now with
the hunter?

10:42.575 --> 10:44.577
And she's over at her house
blaming it all on meadow.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.078
Me.
It's an old ga

10:46.078 --> 10:47.580
we're under a lot
of pressure, okay?

10:47.580 --> 10:50.583
You try studying day and night
to get into college!

10:50.583 --> 10:52.585
We've been working hard,
we deserved a night.

10:52.585 --> 10:55.087
Sy.
Take it ea
sy, take it ea

10:55.087 --> 10:58.090
i'm sorry you're under
a lot of pressure, meadow.

10:58.090 --> 11:00.593
But, it's still
no excuse.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.598
So, who's this
ecstasy guy?

11:05.598 --> 11:07.600
I just told you, adam.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.101
Ve.
I don't even know him,
he just showed up with ste

11:09.602 --> 11:11.103
is this the same
steve i know?

11:11.103 --> 11:12.605
The school newspaper kid
you're always with?

11:13.105 --> 11:14.106
He's a flake.

11:14.106 --> 11:16.108
Why do you think i stopped
hanging out with him?

11:16.108 --> 11:18.611
That's news to me,
you don't hang out with steve.

11:18.611 --> 11:23.616
It's painful to
talk about, okay?

11:23.616 --> 11:25.117
Well, you're gonna
get punished.

11:25.117 --> 11:29.121
Look, you guys,
i know what i did
was not okay.

11:29.622 --> 11:32.124
I've been thinking
about it a lot,

11:32.124 --> 11:35.127
and i'm really not feeling
good about myself, okay?

11:35.127 --> 11:39.131
And i think you should
take away my discover card.

11:39.131 --> 11:40.633
You better
believe it.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.134
That's right.

11:42.134 --> 11:43.135
For two weeks.

11:43.636 --> 11:44.637
Three.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.647
How do i buy gas?

11:54.647 --> 11:56.649
Your
allowance.

11:56.649 --> 11:59.151
I spent my allowan
ce, and i already owe mom.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.153
The cashmina.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.658
We can wait
on that.

12:05.658 --> 12:08.661
Sh.
Alright, you get
ten dollars a week, ca

12:08.661 --> 12:10.663

until you get
your card back

12:12.665 --> 12:14.166

Oh, oh, oh!

12:31.684 --> 12:33.686
If you lost
that baby fat,

I leave before
the stock market closes,

12:46.699 --> 12:48.701
you scream at me for
not watchin' the phone.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.202
Meet richie aprile.

12:50.703 --> 12:53.706
Jesus christ
, how you doin'?

12:54.206 --> 12:57.209
I gotta tell you,
your brother jacki
e was like a fuckin' god.

12:57.209 --> 12:59.211
A great leader.

12:59.211 --> 13:01.213
I heard a lot
about you.

13:01.213 --> 13:03.215
Yeah, well, i heard
a lot about you.

13:03.215 --> 13:05.217
That's why i'm here.

13:05.217 --> 13:07.720
What do you mean?

13:07.720 --> 13:10.222
Out of respect
for our friend here,

13:10.222 --> 13:12.224
i'm gonna talk nice.

13:12.224 --> 13:15.227
I ever hear you raise
your hands to my niece again,

13:15.227 --> 13:17.730
next time you
won't see my face.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.732
You understand?

13:19.732 --> 13:21.233
Who told you i put
my hand on her?

13:21.233 --> 13:24.236
Is this kid gettin'
jerky with me?

13:24.737 --> 13:28.741
Look, kid, i shouldn't
have to explain myself.

13:28.741 --> 13:30.242
I'm from
the old school.

13:30.242 --> 13:32.745
You wanna raise your hands,
you give her your last name.

13:32.745 --> 13:35.748
Then it's none of
my fucking business.

13:35.748 --> 13:39.752
Until then, you keep
your hands in your pockets.

13:39.752 --> 13:42.254
We understand
each other?

13:46.258 --> 13:48.260
Now get
out of here.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.764
I wanna talk to tony.

13:51.764 --> 13:53.766
Go on.

14:02.274 --> 14:04.777
He's a good kid.

14:04.777 --> 14:08.280
Capable.

14:08.280 --> 14:12.785
Look, ton',
this is the thing.

14:12.785 --> 14:15.788
I wanna get my shy business
back on its feet.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.289
I keep getting
these calls--

14:17.289 --> 14:18.791
sil!

14:19.291 --> 14:20.292
Where the fuck
are you goin'?

14:20.793 --> 14:23.796
I'll talk to y
ou later, richie.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.297
You wanna tell me
what just happened?

14:25.798 --> 14:27.800
No more talking busine
ss with the skipper directly.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.802
Are you fuckin' with me?

14:29.802 --> 14:32.805
You can talk to him,
but not now.

14:32.805 --> 14:35.307
And never here.

14:41.313 --> 14:44.817
Can you believe we drank
a whole bottle of wine

14:44.817 --> 14:46.318
between the
three of us?

14:46.318 --> 14:47.319
Thank god.

14:47.820 --> 14:48.821
Cheers.

14:49.321 --> 14:50.322
Cheers.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.825
Outta here.

14:52.825 --> 14:55.327
Richie broke a chair
over his head.

14:55.327 --> 14:57.329
Are you shittin' me?

14:57.329 --> 14:59.331
Then he smacked beansi
e with the coffee pot

14:59.331 --> 15:00.833
and broke hi
s cheekbone.

15:01.333 --> 15:02.334
Prick, i talked
to him yesterday.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.336
He was all sweetness
and lights.

15:04.336 --> 15:07.339
Already, this big brother
shit is getting old.

15:09.341 --> 15:11.343
Yo, bright eyes...

15:11.343 --> 15:12.845
...where ya goin'?

15:12.845 --> 15:14.346
Paolucc', this
isn't the bing.

15:14.346 --> 15:15.347
What the fuc
k did i say?

15:15.848 --> 15:17.349
Hey, how have
you been?

15:20.352 --> 15:21.854
Can't complain.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.357
You look good.

15:25.357 --> 15:26.859
Where are your
friends going?

15:27.359 --> 15:28.861
Tell them to
come back, join us.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.863
No, they're leaving.

15:30.863 --> 15:33.365
It's my first time here,
the veal is excellent.

15:33.866 --> 15:35.868
What, are we makin'
small talk now?

15:37.369 --> 15:38.370
Nice to see you.

15:38.370 --> 15:39.872
Yeah, you too.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.377
Toodle- oo.

15:46.378 --> 15:49.381
Not a bad ass.

15:49.381 --> 15:51.383
Ps.
She had nice,
pipe- fitter li

15:51.884 --> 15:53.385
no disrespect.

15:53.385 --> 15:55.888
Hey, what do i give a fuck?
I hardly know her.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.389
You mean you would
take the lips,

15:57.389 --> 15:59.892
over the tits?

15:59.892 --> 16:00.893
Trust me, my boy.

16:01.393 --> 16:03.395
There's two things
i'm good at.

16:03.395 --> 16:06.398
That's pulling dents,
and spottin' good blow jobs.

16:06.398 --> 16:09.902
And that sweetie had
world- class blow- job lips.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.905
Am i right, skipper?
Good or no?

16:12.905 --> 16:15.908
What the fuck do i know?
Long time ago.

16:18.911 --> 16:20.913
Alright,
she was good.

16:22.414 --> 16:24.416
Good, or great?

16:27.419 --> 16:29.421
Why the fuck are you
bustin' my balls?

16:29.421 --> 16:30.923
It was a long time ago.

16:30.923 --> 16:33.425
I remember every
blow job i ever got.

16:33.425 --> 16:35.928
How about you,
you remember y
our first blow job?

16:35.928 --> 16:37.429
Yeah, of course.

16:37.429 --> 16:39.932
How long did it ta
ke for the guy to cum?

16:40.933 --> 16:41.934
Did ya hear that?

16:41.934 --> 16:43.435
B,"
i said,"you rememb
er your first blow jo

16:43.435 --> 16:44.937
he said,"yeah."

16:44.937 --> 16:47.439
I said,"how long did
it take for the guy to cum?"

16:47.439 --> 16:50.442
Toodle- fucking- oo?

16:50.442 --> 16:52.444
What the fuck
was that?

16:52.444 --> 16:54.446
God, i couldn't
sleep all night,

16:54.947 --> 16:55.948
i was so embarrassed.

16:56.448 --> 16:57.950
What was so wr
ong with toodle- oo?

16:57.950 --> 16:59.451
It's an accepted
form of goodbye.

16:59.451 --> 17:01.954
That's not the way
i talk with patients.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.956
It wasn't me,
it was someone else.

17:04.455 --> 17:05.958
It was jennifer.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.459
For whatever reason,
at that moment,

17:07.459 --> 17:09.962
er,
you felt safer
showing him jennif

17:09.962 --> 17:11.463
not doctor.

17:11.463 --> 17:13.464
Ble
i mean, what did
you see at that ta

17:13.464 --> 17:15.968
that made you wanna
hide doctor?

17:15.968 --> 17:17.469
And who were you
hiding from?

17:17.469 --> 17:19.471
I saw a patient that
i never wanted to see again.

17:19.972 --> 17:21.973
That's who i was
hiding from, a patient.

17:21.973 --> 17:25.477
When you say,"see",

17:25.477 --> 17:27.479
do you mean that as in
see professionally,

17:27.479 --> 17:29.481
or just plain see?

17:29.481 --> 17:30.482
What's the
difference?

17:30.983 --> 17:32.484
There's a bi
g difference.

17:32.484 --> 17:35.487
If it was just a matter
of plain, old,"see",

17:35.487 --> 17:37.990
then you would have been
the cordial doctor

17:37.990 --> 17:39.992
and said,"goodnight."

17:39.992 --> 17:42.995
But, because he's someone
you didn't wanna see
professionally,

17:42.995 --> 17:44.997
you abandon
the doctor facade,

17:44.997 --> 17:47.499
re.
And adopted the
jennifer postu

17:47.499 --> 17:49.501
hence,"toodle- oo".

17:49.501 --> 17:51.003
Okay, you're almost
there, elliot,

17:51.503 --> 17:52.504
but not quite.

17:52.504 --> 17:56.008
Young girls are
not accountable for
their behavior.

17:56.008 --> 17:59.011
I think toodle- oo
was the action of

17:59.011 --> 18:00.512
a ditsy, young girl.

18:00.512 --> 18:04.016
I regressed into
"the girl thing"

18:04.016 --> 18:07.519
to escape responsibility
for abandoning a patient.

18:07.519 --> 18:11.023
He asked me
for help.

18:12.024 --> 18:15.027
Look, i need you
as a colleague,

18:15.027 --> 18:18.030
to tell me that
i did the right thing.

18:18.030 --> 18:21.033
You gotta ask yourself why
you became a psychiatrist

18:21.033 --> 18:22.534
in the first place.

18:22.534 --> 18:24.536
If it was only to he
lp people to stop smoking

18:24.536 --> 18:26.538
or biting their nails,
then, so be it.

18:26.538 --> 18:28.540
There's nothin
g wrong with that.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.542
I had another patient
who committed suicide

18:31.043 --> 18:33.045
because i was
treating this man.

18:33.045 --> 18:34.546
Because i had to
go on the lam.

18:34.546 --> 18:37.049
Oom
treating patie
nts from a motel r

18:37.049 --> 18:38.550
um,
may not ha
ve been optim

18:38.550 --> 18:40.052
but you were still
there for her,

18:40.052 --> 18:41.553
you were in
phone contact.

18:41.553 --> 18:44.556
It would have been the sam
e if you'd been on vacation.

18:46.558 --> 18:48.560
Did you say,"lam"?

18:51.563 --> 18:54.566
And lifting up into cobra...

18:56.568 --> 19:02.074
og.
And, now, rising up
into downward facing d

19:07.579 --> 19:10.582
coming back down
into cobra.

19:16.088 --> 19:20.092
And relaxing
into child's pose.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.100
Richie.

19:28.600 --> 19:32.604
Janice, you know,
i thought that was you.

19:32.604 --> 19:33.605
Parvati.

19:33.605 --> 19:34.606
Huh?

19:35.107 --> 19:37.609
I changed my name
to parvati in'78.

19:37.609 --> 19:40.112
I thought you live
d in california now.

19:40.112 --> 19:43.115
Seattle, actually,
last couple of years.

19:43.115 --> 19:46.618
So, how long
you been...

19:46.618 --> 19:50.122
out of jail?
One week.

19:50.622 --> 19:52.624
That's where i picked up
this yoga shit.

19:52.624 --> 19:55.627
Well, it's working for you,
you seem very supple.

19:55.627 --> 19:58.130
I do a lot
ta stretching.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.631
So, you back now?

19:59.631 --> 20:02.134
My mom's
at st. Erasmus,
a stroke.

20:02.134 --> 20:03.135
At.
I'm sorry
to hear th

20:03.135 --> 20:05.637
tony didn't say
anything about it.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.642
I guess we're all
getting a little older.

20:10.642 --> 20:12.644
Only if that's
our choice.

20:26.658 --> 20:28.160
You drag me all the wa
y out to this place,

20:28.160 --> 20:29.661
i'm walkin' throug
h the food court,

20:29.661 --> 20:32.164
this fucking kid spill
ed fried rice all over me.

20:32.164 --> 20:33.165
Alright,
take it easy.

20:33.165 --> 20:34.666
Keep your
voice down.

20:34.666 --> 20:36.168
Let's talk.

20:36.168 --> 20:38.170
How would
you feel?

20:38.170 --> 20:40.172
Es,
you wrap up a dime,
your crew evaporat

20:40.672 --> 20:43.175
and you walk away from me
like i got some catchy disease.

20:43.175 --> 20:44.676
Hey, i don't talk
business with anybody,

20:44.676 --> 20:46.178
don't take
it personal.

20:46.178 --> 20:48.180
A guy in my position
is a government target.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.182
Why do you think we're
meetin' in a fuckin' mall?

20:50.682 --> 20:53.185
It feels
disrespectful.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.687
That's all
i'm sayin'.

20:55.687 --> 20:57.689
I'm the guy who saved you
from the hit parade.

20:58.190 --> 21:01.693
When did you e
ver step in for me?

21:01.693 --> 21:03.195
You forget?

21:03.195 --> 21:04.696
When you and
my kid brother

21:04.696 --> 21:06.698
stuck up
feech lamanna's
card game?

21:06.698 --> 21:08.200
Get the fuck
out of here.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.201
Feech was made before
the electric light.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.702
If it wasn't for me,

21:10.702 --> 21:12.204
you two kids would
a caught a vicious beatin'

21:12.204 --> 21:13.705
st.
To say the lea

21:13.705 --> 21:16.208
richie, you know
i love you.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.209
You're like
my big brother, okay?

21:17.709 --> 21:19.211
You're gonna be
taken care of.

21:19.211 --> 21:20.212
What was yours
before you went away

21:20.712 --> 21:22.214
will be yours again.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.216
You just gotta
give it some time.

21:24.216 --> 21:28.220
Jesus, anthony,
you'd do that for me?

21:28.220 --> 21:30.222
Hey, fuck you.

21:30.222 --> 21:34.226
What's mine is not
yours to give me.

21:34.226 --> 21:36.728
Hey, prick, you
reached out to me.

21:37.229 --> 21:39.231
I said wha
t i wanted to say.

21:44.236 --> 21:45.737
We got a
problem, kid?

21:46.238 --> 21:48.740
I'm just trying to get you
to slow the fuck down, okay?

21:48.740 --> 21:50.242
Things are
different now.

21:50.242 --> 21:53.245
You gotta be
extra, extra careful.

21:53.245 --> 21:55.247
When do you know m
e not to be careful?

21:55.247 --> 21:57.249
When?

21:57.249 --> 21:59.251
How about, you been out
of the can ten fucking minutes,

21:59.251 --> 22:00.752
already, you're trying
to shake down beansie

22:00.752 --> 22:02.254
for a piece of
his pizza joints.

22:02.254 --> 22:05.757
Do me a favor, back off,
he's a good earner.

22:05.757 --> 22:07.259
Yeah, for you.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.761
Hey, that's none of
your fucking cazzis.

22:09.761 --> 22:11.763
Those pizza joints are
strictly a cash business.

22:12.264 --> 22:13.765
They come in handy.

22:13.765 --> 22:15.767
He's a sneak
y cocksucker.

22:15.767 --> 22:17.269
Whatever,
back off.

22:17.769 --> 22:19.771
Are you takin' the sid
e of a civilian over me?

22:19.771 --> 22:21.723
Jesus fuckin'
christ, richie,

22:21.723 --> 22:23.225
i'm askin' you
to do me a favor.

22:23.225 --> 22:24.226
If you wanna
do it, do it,

22:24.226 --> 22:25.227
if you don't,
go fuck yourself.

22:25.727 --> 22:27.729
Oh, yeah?

22:27.729 --> 22:29.231
Yeah.

22:29.231 --> 22:31.733
How's your sister?

22:31.733 --> 22:34.236
Hey, there's no need
for that kinda talk.

22:34.736 --> 22:36.238
What?

22:36.238 --> 22:37.739
My sister.

22:37.739 --> 22:41.743
Janice,
how's she doing?

22:43.245 --> 22:46.748
Oh, i thought
you were baitin' me.

22:47.249 --> 22:50.252
How's your sister,
fuck your mother.

22:50.252 --> 22:51.753
No.

24:02.824 --> 24:04.326
Have you seen
what she did?

24:04.326 --> 24:05.827
Who?

24:05.827 --> 24:08.330
Meadow, that
house is fucked!

24:08.330 --> 24:10.832
Ar.

didn't swe

24:11.333 --> 24:12.834

talking about?

24:12.834 --> 24:16.838
I'm outraged, no,
i am beyond outraged.

24:16.838 --> 24:18.340
Talk about disgrace.

24:18.340 --> 24:20.842
Disrespect for other
people's property!

24:20.842 --> 24:23.845
That place looks like
a freakin' shooting gallery!

24:23.845 --> 24:24.846
It smells
of urine,

24:25.347 --> 24:27.349
there's puke all over
the beautiful hardwood floors.

24:27.849 --> 24:29.351
It sounds like your
apartment in venice!

24:29.351 --> 24:30.852
Don't worry about
it, she's been punished.

24:30.852 --> 24:32.854
Oh, three weeks without
a credit card?

24:32.854 --> 24:34.856
That's some
heavy shit there!

24:34.856 --> 24:35.857
Janice!

24:36.358 --> 24:37.359
If that

24:37.359 --> 24:39.361

24:39.361 --> 24:41.329
You got a lot of fucki
ng balls, you know that?

24:41.329 --> 24:42.330
Don't talk to me
like that.

24:42.330 --> 24:43.331
Tony.

24:43.331 --> 24:44.833
No, let's clear
the air here.

24:44.833 --> 24:46.835
You come ridin' into tow
n like some vishnu- come- lately

24:46.835 --> 24:47.836
and try to play
the concerned daughter,

24:48.336 --> 24:49.337
who the fuck
are you kiddin'?

24:49.838 --> 24:51.339
You're just here to pick
the friggin' bones.

24:51.339 --> 24:53.341
There's a lot
i could say right now,

24:53.341 --> 24:55.844
that i am not gonna say.

24:55.844 --> 24:58.847
Lotta balls.

25:01.850 --> 25:03.351
Temper tantrums!

25:03.351 --> 25:05.353
He hasn't changed one iota
since we lived in newark.

25:05.854 --> 25:06.855
Not one iota!

25:06.855 --> 25:09.357
You are passing
judgment on him, janice,

25:09.357 --> 25:10.859
on us,
as parents.

25:10.859 --> 25:12.861
Dy.
I told you
once alrea

25:12.861 --> 25:14.362
how we discipline
our children

25:14.362 --> 25:15.864
is none of
anybody's business.

25:15.864 --> 25:17.866
You let that girl
ride roughshod over you,

25:17.866 --> 25:19.367
some day you're
gonna regret it.

25:19.367 --> 25:21.369
Mother of god, janice!

25:21.369 --> 25:23.371
Are all of you
sopranos the same?

25:23.371 --> 25:24.873
I asked you nice
ly to stay out of it,

25:24.873 --> 25:26.374
but, you're pretending
you don't hear me.

25:26.374 --> 25:27.876
Well, maybe you're
gonna hear this.

25:27.876 --> 25:29.878
Ss,

fucking busine

25:29.878 --> 25:32.380

when it comes to my ki

25:32.380 --> 25:33.882
alright?

25:36.384 --> 25:38.386
Maybe i've stayed
here too long.

25:48.897 --> 25:50.398
The fall in the shower
didn't in any way

25:50.398 --> 25:52.901
affect the pre- existin
g condition in your heart.

25:52.901 --> 25:54.402
But you
already knew that.

25:54.402 --> 25:56.404
It never hurts
to be sure.

25:56.404 --> 25:58.907
Fucking bum hip.

25:58.907 --> 26:01.910
What next, does
the man upstairs
have in store for me?

26:01.910 --> 26:04.913
En.
You're lucky it was
sprained, not brok

26:04.913 --> 26:07.415

i've been feeling these...

26:07.415 --> 26:09.417
little fibrillations.

26:09.417 --> 26:10.919
Psychosomatic.

26:10.919 --> 26:12.420
You got out of jail
on a medical.

26:12.420 --> 26:14.923
It's the mind- body
connection.

26:15.423 --> 26:16.925
Your body's just
pitching in to help.

26:19.427 --> 26:23.431
Hey, there's my boy.

26:23.431 --> 26:26.434
I was afraid you didn't
get the message.

26:57.966 --> 26:59.467
He's a good kid.

26:59.467 --> 27:00.969
Lets me use the
doctor/patient thing

27:00.969 --> 27:03.471
to meet people here.

27:05.473 --> 27:07.976
Fucking house arrest.

27:27.495 --> 27:28.997
Like the man said,

27:28.997 --> 27:30.999
"may you live in
interesting times."

27:30.999 --> 27:33.001
You met with tony?

27:33.001 --> 27:36.004
It's more like a fucki
ng audience with the pope.

27:36.004 --> 27:38.506
What are you
gonna do?

27:42.510 --> 27:44.512
Whatever
you tell me.

27:51.519 --> 27:54.522
You and your brother
were always good boys.

27:54.522 --> 27:58.526
You tell me,
this is the way it is,
then so be it.

27:58.526 --> 28:01.529
You tell m

Once again,
a big welcome home

28:13.041 --> 28:15.043
to our guest of honor.

28:15.043 --> 28:17.045
Richie was surprised
all the changes

28:17.045 --> 28:18.546
the last ten years.

28:18.546 --> 28:20.048
New jersey with
its own hockey team.

28:20.048 --> 28:21.549
You know,
it's interesting.

28:21.549 --> 28:23.051
The meadowlands is
the only nhl arena

28:23.051 --> 28:26.054
where the penalty box
is maximum security!

28:27.555 --> 28:31.559
Maximum security
penalty box. Help me.

28:31.559 --> 28:33.061
What the fuck?

28:33.061 --> 28:35.063
I was talking to
paulie walnuts,

28:35.063 --> 28:36.564

the impression

28:36.564 --> 28:38.566
that richie had
been in bosnia,

28:38.566 --> 28:41.569
where there's also a large
moose- lim population!

28:41.569 --> 28:43.571
Get this fucki

29:11.099 --> 29:14.102

Imagine that.

29:18.106 --> 29:19.607

Exploitin' medical
curiosities

29:21.609 --> 29:23.611
is against
the law.

29:23.611 --> 29:25.613
Is that why they canceled
your mother's audition?

29:25.613 --> 29:27.115
What d
id you say?

29:27.615 --> 29:29.617

Careful.

30:13.611 --> 30:14.612
Enough.

30:14.612 --> 30:16.114
He just did te

30:16.114 --> 30:18.616
He's got a right to be
a little fucked up.

30:18.616 --> 30:20.118

31:34.692 --> 31:36.694

gonna do for you, huh?

31:36.694 --> 31:38.696
You know, you got
a raging hard- on for me,

31:38.696 --> 31:40.198
and, i don't even

31:41.199 --> 31:42.700
Come here,

31:42.700 --> 31:43.201
No.

31:43.701 --> 31:45.203
Come here,

31:45.203 --> 31:46.704
How come you weren't
at the party?

31:46.704 --> 31:49.207
Hey, i moved a lotta "h"
for you and your brother.

31:49.207 --> 31:50.708
And you guys made
the lion's share.

31:50.708 --> 31:53.211
You're just bitter because
i invested my money smart,

31:53.211 --> 31:56.214
and you spread yours
however the fuck you did.

31:56.214 --> 31:59.217
I spent mine on lawyers,
you slippery fuck.

31:59.217 --> 32:00.718
You wanna talk
like a tough guy?

32:00.718 --> 32:03.221
Tough guy, here!

32:03.221 --> 32:05.223
Hey, come on, please,
no guns, come on.

32:05.223 --> 32:06.224

32:29.247 --> 32:30.748
Janice.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.252
Oh, sorry, is the
music too loud?

32:34.252 --> 32:35.753
Oh, no, it's fine.

32:35.753 --> 32:39.757
Umm, i just wanted
to apologize.

32:39.757 --> 32:42.760
You know,
about earlier.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.763
No, i should be
apologizing to you.

32:46.264 --> 32:49.767
I was out of line,
you're right.

32:49.767 --> 32:54.272
I never raised a child.

32:54.272 --> 32:55.773
I was robbed of that

32:55.773 --> 32:58.776
when eugene took him
back to montreal.

32:58.776 --> 33:01.279
I'm still petitioning
the state department,

33:01.279 --> 33:04.282
but, i think they have me
on their enemy radicals list.

33:04.282 --> 33:07.785
When was the last time
you saw harpo?

33:07.785 --> 33:11.289
He changed
his name to hal.

33:11.289 --> 33:14.292
I'm sorry, carm, can
we not talk about him?

33:14.792 --> 33:16.294
Look, i just
want you to know

33:16.794 --> 33:18.296
that i was way
out of line.

33:18.296 --> 33:21.799
Well, i'm sorry, too
, really, i feel terrible.

33:21.799 --> 33:24.302
You know,
you're family.

33:24.302 --> 33:26.804
And family means a lot.

33:26.804 --> 33:29.307
I just don't feel righ
t about you leaving here.

33:29.807 --> 33:31.809
I don't know.

33:31.809 --> 33:35.313
I don't think
tony wants me here.

33:35.313 --> 33:37.315
Well, where yo
u gonna go?

33:37.315 --> 33:38.816
The house is
in no condition
to move into.

33:38.816 --> 33:40.318
Especially now.

33:40.318 --> 33:41.819
I'll be alright.

33:42.320 --> 33:44.822
No, i'm sorry,
i can't let you leave.

33:44.822 --> 33:48.326
Really, i want
you to stay.

33:48.326 --> 33:50.328
Okay, thanks.

33:50.328 --> 33:52.330
Ay.
Ok

33:52.330 --> 33:55.333
goodnight.

33:55.333 --> 33:56.834
Goodnight.

33:56.834 --> 34:00.338
Oh, maybe just
a little bit,
the music.

34:00.338 --> 34:01.339
Right.

34:20.358 --> 34:22.860
Jesus, no,
richie, no!

34:24.362 --> 34:26.364
Jesus!

34:59.897 --> 35:03.401
Should i put
the chocolate in now?

35:03.401 --> 35:04.902
Put it in,
i'll pour the milk.

35:05.403 --> 35:08.906
What did you parents finally
say about last saturday?

35:08.906 --> 35:10.908
The usual, nothing.

35:10.908 --> 35:12.910
They're afraid
i'll go bulimic again.

35:12.910 --> 35:15.413
Mine, blah, blah, blah.

35:15.413 --> 35:17.415
Start purging,
they won't say anything.

35:17.415 --> 35:18.416
When are they
gonna realize

35:18.416 --> 35:19.917
that we're
practically adults,

35:19.917 --> 35:21.419
responsible
for ourselves?

35:21.419 --> 35:23.421
So, your grandmother's house
got used for a party.

35:23.421 --> 35:25.923
Excuse me, would they
prefer we go to limelight?

35:25.923 --> 35:28.426
It's'cause they
have no life.

35:28.426 --> 35:30.428
They focus on bullshit.

35:30.428 --> 35:31.929
So, what'd yours do?

35:32.430 --> 35:34.932
They took away
my discover card
for 3 weeks.

35:34.932 --> 35:36.434
Oh, that's nothing.

35:36.434 --> 35:37.935
I know,
it was my idea.

35:37.935 --> 35:39.937
Oo.
So hypocritical, t

35:39.937 --> 35:42.440
when you think how
my dad makes a living.

35:44.942 --> 35:47.945
Oh, sheez,
what is this?

35:47.945 --> 35:51.449
Why don't you ring
for the nurse?

35:51.449 --> 35:52.950
Never you mind.

35:52.950 --> 35:53.951
Ob.
That's their j

35:54.452 --> 35:56.454
i don't need them.

35:56.454 --> 35:58.956
My daughter came all
the way from seattle.

36:03.461 --> 36:05.463
Oh, jesus!

My johnny would

37:12.530 --> 37:16.033
Oh, please, don't start

37:16.033 --> 37:19.537
She did it

38:44.121 --> 38:46.624
I bet you're very
good to your mother.

38:54.632 --> 38:57.134
She'll be better
when i get her home.

38:57.635 --> 39:00.137
Does that mean you're
sticking around jersey?

39:00.137 --> 39:02.139
If i don't, who's
gonna take care of her?

39:02.139 --> 39:03.641
What about tony?

39:04.141 --> 39:06.644
Long story.

39:06.644 --> 39:08.646
You haven't hear
d what happened?

39:08.646 --> 39:11.148
Anthony's one of these people
who blames everyone else

39:11.148 --> 39:12.650
for anything
bad in his life,

39:12.650 --> 39:14.151
er.
Including his moth

39:14.151 --> 39:16.153
tony, nah.

39:16.153 --> 39:19.657
Trust me, nothing'
s ever his fault.

39:19.657 --> 39:23.160
So, what's with
the flowers,

39:23.160 --> 39:25.162
mr. Candy stripe?

39:25.162 --> 39:28.165
Well, i couldn't come
visit her empty- handed.

39:28.165 --> 39:30.167
Oh.

39:30.167 --> 39:32.169
You weren't in yoga.

39:32.169 --> 39:34.171
I'm very bus
y with my mother.

39:34.171 --> 39:35.673
Too busy
for dinner?

39:35.673 --> 39:37.675
You and i weren't good for
each other 20 years ago.

39:38.175 --> 39:40.177
What makes you think
it's gonna be different now?

39:40.177 --> 39:42.179
That's gettin'
to the point.

39:42.179 --> 39:44.682
Richie, after all i put in
to getting to where i am,

39:44.682 --> 39:47.685
it'd be ridiculous
to decompensate now.

39:47.685 --> 39:50.688
I'm so not tha
t person anymore.

39:51.188 --> 39:53.691
It works both ways.

39:53.691 --> 39:58.195
I don't think
i'd be interested
in the same jan i knew.

40:01.198 --> 40:02.700
So, what,
you've grown?

40:03.200 --> 40:04.702
Well, you tell me.

40:04.702 --> 40:06.203
Did you ever think
you'd see richie aprile

40:06.203 --> 40:10.207
doing a "downward
facing dog"?

40:16.213 --> 40:18.716
Can she put anymore
gook shit in here?

40:18.716 --> 40:19.717
It's not that much.

40:19.717 --> 40:22.219
Soy milk this,
tofu that.

40:22.219 --> 40:23.220
I hate a
ll that shit.

40:23.721 --> 40:25.222
Yeah, me too.

40:25.222 --> 40:26.724
Shut up, you said yo
u like the soy milk.

40:27.224 --> 40:29.226
I lied, she was taking me
to the video store.

40:29.226 --> 40:31.729
I'm happy
aunt parvati's
gonna stay.

40:31.729 --> 40:34.231
Oh, your aunt who
doesn't think you
get punished enough?

40:34.231 --> 40:35.733
That party
wasn't my fault,

40:35.733 --> 40:37.735
how many fucking tim
es do i have to say it?

40:38.235 --> 40:38.736
Hey!

40:38.736 --> 40:39.737
Oh!

40:45.242 --> 40:46.744
Don't look like
you're gonna cry.

40:46.744 --> 40:49.747
You made your bed.

40:53.751 --> 40:55.753
I need 15 dollars.

40:55.753 --> 40:57.254
Excuse me?

40:57.755 --> 40:59.256

40:59.757 --> 41:01.759
We're doing three

41:29.286 --> 41:31.288
Janice should

41:31.789 --> 41:32.790
My sister was halfway
out the door.

41:33.290 --> 41:34.792
You had to fall
for her con?

41:34.792 --> 41:35.793
What was she
gonna do?

41:35.793 --> 41:37.294
Live in a motel
which she can't afford?

41:37.294 --> 41:38.796
How about she goes bac
k to wherever it was

41:38.796 --> 41:40.297
she was hiding
for twenty years

41:40.297 --> 41:41.298
while i took car
e of her mother.

41:41.799 --> 41:42.800
I thought we weren't
supposed to mention

41:43.300 --> 41:44.802
grandma in
this house.

41:44.802 --> 41:47.805
Fine, i'm not gonna
argue with you, tony.

41:47.805 --> 41:48.806
If want her to leave,

41:48.806 --> 41:50.307
you're gonna have to
tell her, 'cause i'm not.

41:50.808 --> 41:52.309
It's not christian.

41:52.309 --> 41:54.812

she's a buddhist.

your mother.

44:40.978 --> 44:43.480

44:45.482 --> 44:47.985
Hey, is that
anyway to talk?

44:47.985 --> 44:48.986

When it comes
to spinal injuries,

45:51.048 --> 45:52.549
everything's
a mystery to them.

45:52.549 --> 45:55.552

48:11.688 --> 48:13.690
Because he didn't

48:13.690 --> 48:15.692
When's the last time you
visited anybody in the can?

48:15.692 --> 48:18.195
