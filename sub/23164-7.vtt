WEBVTT

00:00.271 --> 00:01.272
Thomas?

00:01.580 --> 00:02.581
Susan?

00:04.368 --> 00:06.638
I hope you find that will soon.

00:06.703 --> 00:08.373
Arthur's getting
a little desperate.

00:09.773 --> 00:11.576
Where's your gun?
It's in the shop.

00:11.643 --> 00:14.348
You call yourself
a professional!

00:14.412 --> 00:16.884
Why don't you ioin forces
and look for it together.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.121
Don't move.

00:25.058 --> 00:27.429
I'd be very happy if
I never saw you again.

00:27.995 --> 00:29.698
Fine. Fine!

02:16.523 --> 02:18.059
I got his
answering machine again.

02:18.591 --> 02:20.361
At least he could've called.

02:20.427 --> 02:21.929
So damn irresponsible.

02:22.363 --> 02:23.899
Twenty minutes late
is irresponsible.

02:23.965 --> 02:25.668
He was due over an hour ago.

02:26.167 --> 02:27.687
Wonder if he's in
some kind of trouble?

02:27.702 --> 02:29.672
You bet he's in trouble.
With me!

02:30.006 --> 02:31.408
Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.

02:31.874 --> 02:33.811
You're sorry? You're sorry!

02:33.876 --> 02:35.813
I lay out 200 bucks
to Jerry Kanelo

02:35.878 --> 02:38.718
because you tell me that he's
the best marlin guide around,

02:39.449 --> 02:42.121
and now you just waste
half our fishing time.

02:42.186 --> 02:44.925
And remember, I have to
get back for OO charter.

02:44.989 --> 02:47.995
Come on T.C., not you, too. Can't you
get someone else to fly the charter?

02:48.060 --> 02:49.897
I would've been here sooner,
but I had someone after me.

02:49.962 --> 02:51.331
It's a package deal.
Each day this week,

02:51.396 --> 02:54.871
I have to take a different religious
leader to that conference over on Hilo.

02:54.935 --> 02:56.571
You are gonna pay
your full share.

02:57.103 --> 02:59.975
You know, they almost had me at
the estate but I slipped away.

03:00.041 --> 03:01.143
Who almost had you?

03:01.208 --> 03:02.476
What're you talking about?

03:02.542 --> 03:04.947
Mrs. Murtaugh's process servers.

03:05.012 --> 03:06.515
You know, the woman who
lives near the estate?

03:06.581 --> 03:08.017
She's suing her
next-door neighbor.

03:08.083 --> 03:11.122
See, his Dalmatian supposedly
ravished her Shih Tzu,

03:12.621 --> 03:16.362
and she is claiming that I happened
to see it when I was jogging by.

03:16.426 --> 03:17.895
So, she's trying to subpoena me.

03:21.799 --> 03:24.103
Waiting to testify
that I didn't see anything.

03:24.169 --> 03:26.039
So, as of now,
I am officially on the I am.

03:26.104 --> 03:27.740
You don't know me,
you haven't seen me.

03:27.806 --> 03:29.074
I don't wanna know you.

03:29.407 --> 03:30.909
Are we going fishing or not?

03:30.976 --> 03:32.679
Yeah, it sounds like a great way
to get lost for half a day.

03:32.745 --> 03:34.247
Excuse me. Thomas Magnum?

03:34.312 --> 03:37.285
Me? No. Absolutely not.
Who told you that?

03:37.350 --> 03:40.355
Uh, Jonathan Higgins said I
might be able to find him here,

03:40.419 --> 03:42.257
and a waitress
just pointed you out.

03:42.322 --> 03:44.092
Oh! Rosine?

03:44.158 --> 03:45.627
She just can't get us straight.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.496
I'm not Thomas Magnum.

03:47.562 --> 03:49.632
I'm Earl,
Thomas Magnum's brother.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.499
Right, guys?

03:51.566 --> 03:52.635
Right, it's his brother.

03:52.701 --> 03:53.936
Yeah, good old Earl.

03:54.403 --> 03:56.106
I really needed to see him.

03:56.172 --> 03:58.577
I don't suppose
you're a detective, too?

03:58.642 --> 04:01.314
A private investigator?
No, I'm an exterminator.

04:01.378 --> 04:02.981
What am I gonna do now? I...

04:04.447 --> 04:06.852
I'm sorry. It's not your fault.

04:07.718 --> 04:09.455
I'm Melissa Wainwright. Oh.

04:11.223 --> 04:13.026
If you see your brother,
would you please tell him

04:13.091 --> 04:16.565
that I want to hire him right away,
and I'll pay him anything he asks?

04:19.565 --> 04:22.270
Maybe if I could tell him
a little bit about the case?

04:24.071 --> 04:25.407
All right. Uh...

04:29.577 --> 04:30.946
it's kind of personal.

04:31.012 --> 04:33.851
I think I know where we could
be a little more private.

04:33.916 --> 04:35.018
Excuse me.

04:37.887 --> 04:41.160
Oh, Earl, I don't even
know where to start.

04:43.393 --> 04:45.830
Your brother came
highly recommended.

04:46.330 --> 04:49.870
I need his help urgently. I-l don't
have anybody else to advise me.

04:49.934 --> 04:52.472
At least, not anymore.

04:54.339 --> 04:57.412
It's just that I've been so
confused since it happened.

05:00.412 --> 05:04.220
I lost my father in a boating
accident three weeks ago.

05:05.719 --> 05:07.155
I'm still in mourning.

05:07.855 --> 05:09.258
Gee, I'm sorry.

05:10.624 --> 05:11.860
Thank you, Mr. Magnum.

05:11.927 --> 05:15.768
Look, Miss Wainwright, I
think I owe you an apology.

05:16.199 --> 05:17.668
When you came to the table,

05:18.267 --> 05:20.438
I really didn't think
you were a client.

05:20.503 --> 05:21.705
I don't understand.

05:21.771 --> 05:23.708
Well, I thought you
were someone else,

05:23.773 --> 05:25.677
someone I didn't Wanna See.

05:25.743 --> 05:28.080
Actually, I am Thomas Magnum.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.216
You tricked me?

05:31.282 --> 05:33.019
Is that how you have fun
with your friends?

05:33.084 --> 05:35.924
No, believe me, nO, nO, nO.
Wait, wait, wait, please.

05:36.521 --> 05:37.957
Please, look.

05:38.023 --> 05:40.294
Miss Wainwright, I'm sorry.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.297
I didn't intend to fool you

05:42.362 --> 05:44.032
or make light of your situation.

05:44.097 --> 05:45.967
I'd like to help you if I can.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.805
It's my brother, Arthur.

05:51.038 --> 05:52.039
L...

05:53.108 --> 05:54.743
Maybe this is a mistake.
I should go.

05:54.810 --> 05:56.747
No, no, no, no, no.
No, this is a mistake.

05:56.812 --> 05:58.047
No, come on, it's all right.

05:58.113 --> 05:59.683
I mean, you've gone this far.

06:00.850 --> 06:02.620
This is gonna sound so terrible.

06:03.454 --> 06:05.991
Well, just take
a deep breath and

06:06.790 --> 06:07.926
tell me.

06:09.627 --> 06:13.034
I think my brother may have killed
our father and stolen his will.

06:14.199 --> 06:15.902
Well, that's quite a statement.

06:15.967 --> 06:17.236
If you have some proof,
the police...

06:17.303 --> 06:19.941
No, I don't, at least
nothing substantial.

06:20.006 --> 06:21.809
Arthur was being disinherited,

06:21.874 --> 06:24.246
and he was on the boat the night
my father fell overboard,

06:24.311 --> 06:26.114
and now Dad's will is missing.

06:26.180 --> 06:27.950
Circumstantial evidence.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.723
Well, maybe I could
shore it up for you.

06:32.787 --> 06:36.327
It's not all. Arthur claims
to be looking for the will.

06:36.392 --> 06:39.766
He called and he asked me to meet him
tonight at one of Dad's warehouses.

06:40.497 --> 06:42.234
I'm afraid to go, Mr. Magnum.

06:42.299 --> 06:43.668
Well, don't.

06:43.732 --> 06:45.102
Just don't.

06:45.168 --> 06:47.339
I'll go, and I'll talk to Arthur

06:48.472 --> 06:50.175
and see if I can find out
what he's up to.

06:50.241 --> 06:52.478
That is, if you still
wanna hire me.

06:53.277 --> 06:54.847
Yes, I do.

06:56.581 --> 06:58.384
Thank you, Mr. Magnum.

06:58.450 --> 06:59.653
Thomas.

07:01.954 --> 07:03.190
Melissa.

07:07.026 --> 07:09.131
Yo! Yo!

07:09.196 --> 07:10.766
Hey you, big guy!

07:10.831 --> 07:12.033
A little help!

07:15.937 --> 07:17.640
Thomas Magnum!

07:17.706 --> 07:18.707
Dutton?

07:18.773 --> 07:20.776
Consider yourself
officially served.

07:28.185 --> 07:30.990
Process serving? Is that the
kind of case you're taking now?

07:31.054 --> 07:34.428
I'm sorry, Magnum, but all's
fair in business and war.

07:40.165 --> 07:42.168
I know what you're
thinking, and you're right.

07:42.234 --> 07:43.937
There are few things
more dangerous

07:44.003 --> 07:46.274
than getting in the middle
of a family quarrel.

07:46.339 --> 07:49.311
Especially a family quarrel
over a large fortune.

07:49.377 --> 07:50.846
Ask any cop, and he'll tell you

07:50.911 --> 07:53.984
more policemen are injured
answering family disturbance calls

07:54.048 --> 07:55.718
than any other kind.

07:55.783 --> 07:57.353
It's like that old
love song says,

07:57.419 --> 07:59.356
"You always hurt
the one you love."

07:59.421 --> 08:02.093
And anyone else who happens
to be in the line of fire.

08:02.925 --> 08:06.165
Well, I wasn't planning
OO news the hard way.

08:29.289 --> 08:30.524
Melissa?

08:31.425 --> 08:32.461
No.

09:17.345 --> 09:20.284
Better give it up, bud,
or I'll ventilate you.

09:22.585 --> 09:24.121
I have a theory.
You wanna hear it?

09:24.186 --> 09:25.388
No!

09:26.222 --> 09:28.660
I think you're a woman
pretending to be a man.

09:28.724 --> 09:31.696
A bullet doesn't care
whose hand pulls the trigger!

09:35.198 --> 09:38.338
I also think you read
too many detective novels.

09:39.571 --> 09:40.940
Hey.

09:41.005 --> 09:44.045
You wouldn't happen to be a tall

09:44.109 --> 09:46.747
average-looking guy with
a mustache, would you?

09:50.316 --> 09:51.819
What if I am?

09:51.885 --> 09:56.361
Did you ever spend a weekend in a
bank vault with a stunning brunette?

10:04.966 --> 10:06.269
Susan?

10:08.237 --> 10:09.439
Thomas?

10:11.207 --> 10:12.276
Susan Johnson?

10:13.009 --> 10:14.445
I don't believe it!

10:16.480 --> 10:19.653
Oh, Thomas.
I am so glad to see you.

10:19.717 --> 10:22.289
I had no idea
you were back in town.

10:22.353 --> 10:25.092
Yeah, well, surprise!

10:25.156 --> 10:26.659
How's the saxophone-playing?

10:26.725 --> 10:28.830
Excellent. And you're
not back at the bank.

10:28.894 --> 10:30.096
No, I was. I went back.

10:30.162 --> 10:31.331
I thought you were quitting.

10:31.398 --> 10:32.533
Well, I did but I went...

10:32.599 --> 10:36.607
Well, I was working there while
I was studying at the, uh,

10:36.671 --> 10:37.839
Lucky Steele Detective School.

10:39.574 --> 10:41.144
Lucky Steele? Yeah.

10:41.209 --> 10:44.482
The guy on late-night TV? Susan,
come on, his hair isn't even real.

10:45.414 --> 10:47.552
Well, maybe not,
but my license is.

10:48.183 --> 10:50.454
I got it three weeks ago
and this is my first case.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.123
Oh, congratulations.

10:52.188 --> 10:53.523
Thank you.

10:54.324 --> 10:57.999
Do you think maybe we could
continue talking outside?

10:58.062 --> 11:00.500
This is a little bit
too déjà yu for me.

11:00.565 --> 11:02.000
Oh, yeah.

11:02.467 --> 11:05.067
That's right. We have this habit
of getting locked in little rooms.

11:05.103 --> 11:06.539
Don't say "locked." Don't. Yeah.

11:13.279 --> 11:14.882
Don't kid around, Thomas.

11:14.947 --> 11:16.350
Who's kidding?

11:17.251 --> 11:18.353
It's stuck.

11:19.953 --> 11:21.356
You did it again!

11:21.422 --> 11:23.727
You locked us in here!
We're trapped!

11:23.792 --> 11:25.294
No, I haven't!

11:31.701 --> 11:34.807
Of course, it might take us
a couple minutes to get out.

11:37.708 --> 11:38.776
Thomas,

11:39.377 --> 11:41.447
are you representing
Melissa Wainwright?

11:42.580 --> 11:46.288
Didn't Lucky Steele tell you
about client confidentiality?

11:47.452 --> 11:49.657
Oh, you sap.

11:50.590 --> 11:52.593
She is vicious!

11:53.059 --> 11:56.298
She is a vicious, vicious woman!

11:56.830 --> 11:59.402
She probably murdered
her father.

11:59.466 --> 12:00.634
Arthur warned me.

12:00.701 --> 12:03.574
He told me that she might
send a hit man here tonight.

12:03.638 --> 12:06.176
Oh, is that why you tried
to "ventilate" me?

12:06.241 --> 12:08.345
I didn't try to
ventilate you, all right?

12:08.410 --> 12:11.083
You came in here bellowing
like that, and you startled me

12:11.147 --> 12:12.682
and my gun went off, okay?

12:31.003 --> 12:33.006
I don't want to
fight with you, Susan.

12:35.342 --> 12:36.677
I just want to help you.

12:37.410 --> 12:41.218
It seems Arthur Wainwright has pulled
the oldest trick in the book on you.

12:41.282 --> 12:43.386
He's reversed all the facts
in this case.

12:43.451 --> 12:47.359
In reality, Arthur did all the things
that he's accusing Melissa of.

12:47.422 --> 12:50.862
Oh. Well, in that case, where'd
the little witch hide the will?

12:50.927 --> 12:53.799
If you want the will,
I suggest you go ask Arthur!

12:54.464 --> 12:59.106
And to think that I have always looked
up to you as a model investigator.

13:21.461 --> 13:22.496
Oh!

13:29.638 --> 13:31.942
What do you think you're doing?

13:34.678 --> 13:36.013
Oh, heck!

13:36.078 --> 13:37.648
My TV must have been
on the blink

13:37.714 --> 13:41.522
the night that Lucky Steele taught us
how to open a lock with a corkscrew.

13:42.753 --> 13:43.921
Night, Thomas.

13:54.066 --> 13:55.269
Susan?

14:01.040 --> 14:02.041
Susan.

14:07.516 --> 14:10.188
I know what you're thinking,
and you're right.

14:10.919 --> 14:15.663
I felt bad about ending up in competition
with a stand-up guy like Thomas.

14:16.393 --> 14:17.695
I'd always liked his style.

14:18.996 --> 14:23.271
In fact, he had a lot to do with my
deciding to join the flatfoot fraternity.

14:27.706 --> 14:30.445
The first thing I learned at
Lucky Steele's Detective School

14:30.509 --> 14:34.283
was that a savvy P.l. doesn't think
much oF the human condition.

14:34.347 --> 14:36.117
We always suspect everyone.

14:36.716 --> 14:39.823
And that's why we're
so rarely disappointed.

14:44.559 --> 14:49.001
I wasn't ready to panic, but the palm of
my shifting hand was starting to itch.

14:49.063 --> 14:52.838
And since my heap had the
horses, I decided to use them.

14:52.901 --> 14:56.241
I had to hope the gumshoe gods
were watching over me.

15:11.056 --> 15:12.793
What a bozo.

15:15.761 --> 15:17.899
I know what you're thinking,
and you're right.

15:17.964 --> 15:20.502
Reunions are a two-edged sword.

15:20.567 --> 15:24.809
They can be ioyous occasions
or recipes for disaster.

15:24.872 --> 15:27.577
I remember when
I was six or seven,

15:27.642 --> 15:30.815
the Sullivan clan took over half
the city park for the weekend.

15:30.879 --> 15:34.119
By the end of the first day, a huge
argument began between cousins

15:34.183 --> 15:36.922
about something near and dear
to Sullivan hearts.

15:36.986 --> 15:39.624
Probably land or
politics or poetry.

15:41.558 --> 15:45.366
I can still remember asking Grandpa
Sullivan why the family was fighting.

15:45.430 --> 15:46.833
And he said,

15:46.898 --> 15:50.405
"Thomas, you can only get
really angry"

15:50.602 --> 15:53.307
"at those who love you enough
to forgive you."

16:25.843 --> 16:27.011
Nice surveillance car.

16:27.911 --> 16:29.014
Very subtle.

16:29.380 --> 16:30.750
I got mine free.

16:32.317 --> 16:34.588
So, how'd you get out
of the storage room?

16:34.653 --> 16:38.093
Easy. I can always get out. I was
just having some fun with you.

16:38.157 --> 16:39.192
Right.

16:39.258 --> 16:42.431
Is this your investigative technique?
Following me?

16:42.496 --> 16:45.068
Don't flatter yourself. I've
come here to see Arthur.

16:45.132 --> 16:47.370
He won't be here.
Melissa is staying here.

16:47.935 --> 16:49.805
Well, this was the
address he gave me.

16:52.307 --> 16:54.979
Thomas! I've been
waiting for you.

16:56.879 --> 16:58.114
I tried to tell you.

16:58.815 --> 17:00.652
Susan! At last!

17:02.753 --> 17:04.155
I tried to tell you.

17:10.261 --> 17:14.470
Thomas, it was so good to see
you standing at that door.

17:14.532 --> 17:15.702
When I found out

17:15.768 --> 17:18.839
that Arthur had also sent an
investigator to that warehouse,

17:18.904 --> 17:20.473
I was petrified.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.478
I tried to call you
and warn you.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.214
Oh, I appreciate that,
Melissa, but

17:26.914 --> 17:30.053
I do this for a living. You
don't have to worry about me.

17:30.585 --> 17:31.888
I can't help it.

17:31.953 --> 17:34.758
If anything happened to you,
then I'd be all alone again.

17:34.823 --> 17:36.493
Isn't it, uh, kind of risky?

17:36.559 --> 17:40.066
I mean, living in the same house with
somebody who might want to kill you?

17:40.864 --> 17:42.867
I take precautions, yes.

17:43.433 --> 17:45.370
Because you see,
Melissa is the kind of person

17:45.435 --> 17:48.475
that would try to hire someone
to do her dirty work for her.

17:49.906 --> 17:53.981
What would have happened if I had
met Magnum in a dark warehouse?

17:54.513 --> 17:57.318
Well, it's a tough iob,
but somebody has to do it.

17:58.885 --> 18:02.125
You are the greatest, Susan.

18:06.025 --> 18:07.228
Listen, Thomas,

18:08.229 --> 18:10.132
I think I have good news.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.903
I may know where my
father hid the will.

18:13.602 --> 18:16.307
Daddy has this small cabin
on the windward side.

18:16.371 --> 18:19.110
He used to disappear there
and work on his inventions.

18:24.414 --> 18:26.518
Does Arthur know about this?

18:28.218 --> 18:30.055
I don't think he remembers.

18:31.021 --> 18:32.190
Oh, I should warn you,

18:32.257 --> 18:34.962
it's a tiny place on a remote
section of the North Shore,

18:35.026 --> 18:36.629
and there's no security.

18:39.933 --> 18:41.636
Well, it sounds like
just the kind of place

18:41.701 --> 18:43.270
an eccentric like
your father might use.

18:43.336 --> 18:45.106
I'll check it out
in the morning.

18:48.609 --> 18:54.053
I think a woman with your sense of
adventure would simply love sailing.

18:54.115 --> 18:57.722
It is absolutely my favorite
thing in the whole wide world.

18:58.620 --> 18:59.956
At least, it was,

19:00.723 --> 19:02.092
until Dad...

19:02.157 --> 19:04.462
Oh, no, Arthur,
it will be again.

19:04.527 --> 19:08.569
Just as soon as we get this sordid
nightmare buried in the past.

19:18.076 --> 19:19.278
Thomas,

19:19.679 --> 19:22.051
I hope you find that will soon.

19:22.715 --> 19:24.719
I think Arthur's getting
a little desperate.

19:25.051 --> 19:26.186
He is?

19:26.252 --> 19:27.922
I know he doesn't look it,

19:27.988 --> 19:30.928
but he's capable
of extreme violence.

19:30.992 --> 19:32.962
He'd stoop to anything.

20:09.470 --> 20:10.705
Magnum,

20:10.771 --> 20:14.278
you promised to help me get ready for
Sunday's lawn bowling tournament.

20:14.341 --> 20:16.412
But I'm on the
Wainwright case now.

20:16.478 --> 20:20.052
Very well, but the least you can do
is assist in unloading the equipment.

20:27.223 --> 20:29.160
How long have you known
the Wainwrights, Higgins?

20:29.226 --> 20:31.831
I first met William
in Burma, 1944.

20:31.896 --> 20:33.198
He was with Merrill's Marauders.

20:33.263 --> 20:35.801
I was helping train one of the
local Burmese defense forces.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.807
I sometimes think you met
everyone during the war.

20:38.871 --> 20:42.010
Nevertheless, that's where I
first encountered William.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.980
During monsoon season, he constructed
this snowshoe contraption

20:45.044 --> 20:46.647
made of vines and jungle leaves

20:46.713 --> 20:48.716
to keep us from sinking
into that knee-deep muck.

20:48.782 --> 20:50.385
Sounds like a very
resourceful guy.

20:50.450 --> 20:53.088
Quite. Two hours after
we cleared the camp,

20:53.153 --> 20:55.091
an air strike leveled
everything around.

20:55.156 --> 20:58.161
I'm one of several hundred
soldiers who owes his life

20:58.225 --> 21:00.563
to William Wainwright's
inventiveness.

21:01.363 --> 21:03.968
No kidding. Sounds like a great
story for your memoirs, Higgins.

21:04.033 --> 21:05.394
Here, you better let me...
Higgins!

21:07.403 --> 21:08.505
Are you crazy?

21:08.571 --> 21:10.642
You could have hurt yourself,
not to mention me!

21:10.707 --> 21:13.879
Merely a small miscalculation of
relative weight distribution.

21:14.611 --> 21:16.615
The only harm done was...

21:20.585 --> 21:22.623
Naturally, I'll be happy
to replace the contents.

21:22.688 --> 21:24.525
No! No, no, don't worry about it.
It's just a little something.

21:24.590 --> 21:26.193
Nevertheless, I'm
responsible for the damage.

21:26.258 --> 21:28.095
No, no, they're
knitted potholders.

21:28.160 --> 21:29.897
You know, the flatter they
get, the better they work.

21:29.963 --> 21:31.499
I'm afraid I must insist.

21:31.565 --> 21:33.068
Boy, am I late!

21:44.446 --> 21:47.185
Oh, my God!

22:48.221 --> 22:49.423
What are you doing here?

22:49.488 --> 22:50.724
My job.

23:35.809 --> 23:37.045
Aha!

24:50.796 --> 24:52.166
What do you think you're doing?

24:52.799 --> 24:53.967
Let me go.

25:33.346 --> 25:34.548
Congratulations.

25:57.106 --> 25:58.476
Where's your gun?

25:58.541 --> 25:59.776
It's in the shop.

26:00.610 --> 26:01.646
Where?

26:01.712 --> 26:03.352
It's in the shop!
I bent the firing pin...

26:04.215 --> 26:05.283
You what?

26:05.749 --> 26:09.223
I bent the firing pin hammering
my way out of the storage room.

26:12.958 --> 26:15.262
And you call yourself
a professional!

26:16.396 --> 26:18.433
By the way, pro,
before you return fire,

26:18.497 --> 26:20.668
I suggest you put some
bullets in your gun.

26:48.500 --> 26:49.870
Forget it. He's gone.

26:51.069 --> 26:52.372
Don't you mean she's gone?

26:52.438 --> 26:53.506
No, I don't!

26:54.240 --> 26:55.920
And only a rookie like
you would still think

26:55.975 --> 26:58.312
that sweet, lovely Melissa
could be involved in this.

26:58.377 --> 27:00.248
"Sweet, lovely Melissa"?

27:00.880 --> 27:02.116
"Rookie"?

27:03.350 --> 27:05.455
May I remind you
that this rookie

27:05.520 --> 27:07.992
was the one who
had the experience

27:08.056 --> 27:10.494
to be packing iron when
the lead started flying.

27:10.558 --> 27:11.593
Packing iron?

27:11.659 --> 27:14.398
Oh, that's right, because I
was about to get plugged.

27:14.463 --> 27:17.870
About to plunge headlong down the
dark rabbit hole of existence

27:17.933 --> 27:21.240
to that neon Valhalla where the
drinks are pure and the women aren't.

27:21.304 --> 27:23.141
Are you making fun of me?
Yes, I am.

27:23.206 --> 27:24.409
Okay.

27:24.475 --> 27:25.844
Okay, that does it.

27:25.909 --> 27:27.579
You know what I want
from you from now on?

27:27.644 --> 27:28.813
What?

27:28.880 --> 27:29.948
Nothing. Good!

27:30.014 --> 27:31.183
And you know something else?

27:31.250 --> 27:33.487
I'd be very happy
if I never saw you again.

27:33.552 --> 27:35.322
That's fine with me. Fine.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.090
Fine! Fine.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.293
Fine! Fine!

27:48.086 --> 27:49.188
Magnum?

27:52.157 --> 27:53.159
Magnum?

27:55.727 --> 27:57.097
Magnum!

28:01.367 --> 28:03.270
The gunsmith has
repaired your pistol,

28:03.336 --> 28:06.476
and his estimate on
my Webley is $175.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.109
A hundred and...

28:09.177 --> 28:11.882
Okay, fine, fine.
I said I'd pay for it.

28:11.947 --> 28:13.617
There's also someone
here to see you.

28:16.085 --> 28:18.723
Nice looking coat. What
is it, unborn linoleum?

28:22.125 --> 28:25.265
Is that the excellent playing
you were telling me about?

28:25.329 --> 28:27.166
Miss Johnson wants
to talk with you.

28:27.231 --> 28:28.266
Why?

28:28.332 --> 28:30.704
Wait a minute. You told me
he wanted to talk to me.

28:30.768 --> 28:33.073
He does. He just
doesn't know it yet.

28:33.672 --> 28:34.907
What are you doing, Higgins?

28:34.974 --> 28:36.744
The question is,
what are you doing?

28:36.809 --> 28:39.214
In the past three hours, I've
received separate phone calls

28:39.279 --> 28:41.016
from Melissa and
Arthur Wainwright.

28:41.081 --> 28:42.284
Well, why are they calling you?

28:42.349 --> 28:43.784
To complain that the two of you

28:43.850 --> 28:46.255
are impeding one another's
progress on the case

28:46.319 --> 28:49.659
and, in general, behaving like
self-absorbed adolescents.

28:49.724 --> 28:52.129
In other words, much like
Melissa and Arthur themselves.

28:52.194 --> 28:53.931
Well, I can only
speak for myself,

28:53.996 --> 28:56.167
but my investigation is ongoing.

28:56.531 --> 28:58.534
Mine, too. And it's
going quite well.

28:58.601 --> 28:59.736
Nonsense.

29:00.103 --> 29:01.573
Can't the two of you
be professional enough

29:01.638 --> 29:03.876
to stop this squabbling
and declare a truce?

29:07.478 --> 29:09.315
Well, it's all right with me.

29:10.414 --> 29:11.517
But he started it.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.052
I did not! You did, too!

29:16.421 --> 29:17.624
Okay! Truce!

29:18.190 --> 29:19.359
Thank you.

29:20.327 --> 29:23.801
I hope you'll both be equally
adult about my next proposal.

29:23.864 --> 29:25.901
You're both looking
for the same will...

29:26.433 --> 29:28.594
And the truth about what
happened to William Wainwright.

29:28.602 --> 29:31.342
Then why don't you ioin forces
and look for it together?

29:31.639 --> 29:32.741
Together?

29:33.007 --> 29:34.176
Us?

29:34.276 --> 29:35.411
Higgins.

29:36.779 --> 29:38.616
Uh, you don't know
what you're asking.

29:38.681 --> 29:41.754
There are so many reasons
why that wouldn't work.

29:41.818 --> 29:43.153
Please proceed.

29:43.219 --> 29:45.190
I have nothing planned
for this afternoon.

29:45.256 --> 29:47.794
Yes, I'd like to hear some
of those reasons myself.

29:51.997 --> 29:53.299
No, don't.

29:53.765 --> 29:54.967
Don't play again.

30:05.511 --> 30:07.314
I know what you're thinking.

30:07.381 --> 30:11.924
I made a big mistake by letting Higgins
talk me into joining forces with Susan.

30:11.986 --> 30:14.290
And you may be right.
But I've always felt

30:14.355 --> 30:17.428
it's better to have your
mistake right at your elbow

30:17.492 --> 30:19.495
than popping up
when you least expect it.

30:19.562 --> 30:21.265
I know what you're thinking.

30:21.331 --> 30:22.800
I'd broken a P.l. commandment

30:22.865 --> 30:24.301
by teaming up with someone else.

30:24.367 --> 30:28.175
But my gut instinct said this
partnership had a future.

30:28.638 --> 30:33.582
It felt good to be part of a well-oiled
investigative team attacking a tough case.

30:33.644 --> 30:36.049
Two-fisted action,
witty repartee,

30:36.115 --> 30:39.422
and who knows, maybe a touch
of hearts and flowers.

30:39.485 --> 30:41.755
All right. Now, just hang back

30:41.820 --> 30:43.791
and watch how I handle
this situation.

30:43.857 --> 30:44.892
Right.

30:46.960 --> 30:47.996
Gail!

30:49.462 --> 30:51.867
Oh, God, it's good to see you.

30:54.802 --> 30:56.405
You're not Gail, I'm sorry.

30:56.470 --> 30:58.541
No, I'm Julie. Julie Marsh.

30:59.007 --> 31:00.911
But I'd be willing
to change my name.

31:00.977 --> 31:03.014
That's not necessary, Julie.

31:03.079 --> 31:04.582
I'm sorry, I'm Thomas Magnum.

31:04.647 --> 31:06.050
No kidding.

31:06.216 --> 31:07.284
Oh, this is Susan Johnson.

31:07.351 --> 31:10.023
I've always loved the name Tom.
It's so

31:10.521 --> 31:14.061
strong, so sensual...

31:14.125 --> 31:15.427
So easy to spell.

31:15.493 --> 31:17.396
Is there something
I could do for you?

31:17.463 --> 31:20.035
Well, I hope so.
I really hope so.

31:20.699 --> 31:22.436
Actually, you could
do it for both of us.

31:22.501 --> 31:24.338
Right. Uh,

31:24.770 --> 31:27.242
we're trying to locate a
yacht that's berthed here.

31:27.307 --> 31:28.777
It's the Wainwight...

31:29.576 --> 31:31.079
The Wainwright yacht.

31:31.145 --> 31:32.280
Why, Tom,

31:32.346 --> 31:34.984
you know I can't tell you
where people keep their boats.

31:35.417 --> 31:37.087
What if you turned out to be

31:37.685 --> 31:38.788
a criminal?

31:39.121 --> 31:41.058
Well, you could always
frisk me first.

31:41.657 --> 31:43.093
That might be interesting.

31:43.193 --> 31:45.631
Is there a fire hose around here?
Just in case.

31:45.695 --> 31:49.469
But unfortunately the
Wainwright yacht is out.

31:49.732 --> 31:51.937
I thought so. Arthur took it.

31:52.002 --> 31:54.974
I don't think it was Arthur.
I can check the trip sheets.

31:55.739 --> 31:56.774
It might say.

31:56.842 --> 31:58.545
Could you? Thanks!

32:01.746 --> 32:04.518
What are you doing? I'm trying
to get some information, here.

32:04.584 --> 32:06.554
Oh, is that what you
were trying to get?

32:07.521 --> 32:11.095
Tell me, Thomas, is that
the way Melissa Wainwright

32:11.158 --> 32:13.296
suckered you into this case?

32:13.361 --> 32:16.968
With her fluttering eyelashes
and her smoldering looks?

32:17.031 --> 32:18.333
That is not what...

32:19.133 --> 32:20.903
We'll talk about this later.

32:22.438 --> 32:24.676
It doesn't say
who took the boat out.

32:24.740 --> 32:25.908
No crew listed.

32:25.975 --> 32:27.511
Destination, Hilo.

32:27.576 --> 32:28.712
Uh, Julie,

32:28.778 --> 32:31.583
are those the trip sheets
for the Wainwright yacht?

32:32.716 --> 32:34.553
Could I take a look at them?

32:35.219 --> 32:37.991
I don't ordinarily let a man
take a look at my trip sheets

32:38.055 --> 32:40.293
until the second date. But, um,

32:40.359 --> 32:42.497
Thank you. In this case, Tom...

32:43.262 --> 32:45.166
What's this Williams' Island?

32:45.231 --> 32:47.301
That's the Wainwights'
pwivate island.

32:48.768 --> 32:50.070
It's near Hilo.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.372
Hilo? Mmm.

32:51.438 --> 32:53.241
Susan? Susan! Mmm?

32:53.974 --> 32:56.479
How would you like to meet
a major religious leader?

32:56.810 --> 32:58.713
We are always pleased

32:58.779 --> 33:00.219
when you select
Island Hoppers Tours,

33:00.248 --> 33:03.053
because our ultimate goal is to
create those special memories

33:03.118 --> 33:07.528
that make the Hawaiian Islands truly
a land of mystic enchantment.

33:07.924 --> 33:10.362
There's no better way
to see the wonders of Hawaii

33:10.427 --> 33:12.832
than from an Island Hoppers
helicopter.

33:12.896 --> 33:16.536
Your tour is in the hands of a
skilled and experienced pilot,

33:16.601 --> 33:19.073
so sit back
and enjoy the scenery.

33:19.505 --> 33:22.945
As we fly over the surf line
and the golden beaches,

33:23.008 --> 33:26.415
it's easy to imagine the first
explorers to discover these islands.

33:26.712 --> 33:30.052
What must their thoughts have
been when, after weeks at sea,

33:30.116 --> 33:32.220
they saw this unspoiled paradise

33:32.285 --> 33:35.725
where bronzed, young natives
frolicked naked in the waves...

33:37.725 --> 33:39.862
There it is. Miss Melissa.

33:41.396 --> 33:46.240
Why would anyone want to spoil a
beautiful boat with a name like Melissa?

33:57.081 --> 33:59.586
Thomas, this is the last
time that I do this for you.

34:00.518 --> 34:01.787
Sorry about the delay, Rabbi.

34:08.127 --> 34:10.699
The gorgeous islands
which we call Hawaii

34:10.763 --> 34:15.172
have their origin deep in the molten
volcanic depths oF the South Seas.

34:15.369 --> 34:17.873
They are still being formed,
as you can...

34:22.143 --> 34:25.851
I know what you're thinking,
but this time, you're wrong.

34:26.148 --> 34:29.889
Sure, we'd all like reunions to be
happy occasions, full of laughs,

34:29.952 --> 34:31.088
but they aren't always.

34:31.154 --> 34:35.195
And usually, the anger and the
fighting help to clear the air,

34:35.259 --> 34:37.062
and the relationships
that survive

34:37.128 --> 34:40.702
grow stronger and more honest
because of the experience.

34:42.867 --> 34:45.438
I know what you're thinking,
and you're right.

34:45.504 --> 34:48.543
Any self-respecting shamus
thrives on excitement,

34:48.608 --> 34:52.248
but there is a difference
between excitement and terror.

34:52.311 --> 34:55.384
I found myself swallowing a
scream the size of a softball

34:55.449 --> 34:57.954
and the only thing keeping
my hand off the panic button

34:58.018 --> 35:00.823
was the cool confidence
of my new partner.

35:02.057 --> 35:04.127
I know what you're thinking,
and you're right.

35:04.192 --> 35:08.034
I had absolutely no business being
in the jungle with a novice.

35:08.197 --> 35:09.767
But what alternative did I have?

35:09.832 --> 35:13.272
I had accepted responsibility
for Susan as my partner.

35:13.836 --> 35:16.742
So it was up to me
to see us through safely.

35:17.742 --> 35:18.910
Susan, don't move!

35:25.217 --> 35:27.220
I said, "Don't move."

35:27.586 --> 35:29.389
You said "Don't moo!"

35:29.955 --> 35:31.190
What happened?

35:31.257 --> 35:33.260
You tripped a booby trap.

35:33.860 --> 35:36.498
Oh, no! Oh, God!

35:36.564 --> 35:39.036
It's the oldest trick
in the book.

35:39.100 --> 35:40.168
Well, it's okay. I'm sorry.

35:40.234 --> 35:42.706
Susan, it could happen to anybody.
Are you all right?

35:42.771 --> 35:45.076
I feel humiliated!

35:45.207 --> 35:47.244
Well, do you have
that knife in your purse?

35:49.211 --> 35:50.213
Here!

35:58.388 --> 35:59.490
What?

36:00.692 --> 36:03.798
You look like you're wearing
King Kong's hairnet!

36:09.201 --> 36:11.004
It's okay. You can come out now.

36:11.103 --> 36:13.106
Huh? We know you're in there.

36:13.172 --> 36:14.341
We do?

36:19.880 --> 36:22.085
William Wainwright, I presume.

36:41.339 --> 36:43.477
All right, that's far enough.

36:44.343 --> 36:47.515
Don't you think it's about time
you put down the rifle, William?

36:47.579 --> 36:48.714
No, you don't, sonny.

36:48.780 --> 36:51.285
You're not fast-talking
your way out of this.

36:51.351 --> 36:52.653
Oh, come on, Bill.

36:52.719 --> 36:56.193
You're not gonna shoot the two people
you led here to bring you back to life.

36:56.257 --> 36:57.559
Don't talk to him! What...

36:58.325 --> 36:59.460
Led?

36:59.526 --> 37:00.629
What are you talking about?

37:00.694 --> 37:03.066
Well, all the signs were there,
if you really knew where to look.

37:03.131 --> 37:05.301
For instance, the way you
fell overboard that night.

37:05.367 --> 37:06.737
Yeah.

37:07.102 --> 37:09.140
Yeah, that's right!
Without any witnesses!

37:09.205 --> 37:11.242
I always thought that
was awfully convenient.

37:12.041 --> 37:13.644
Then, of course,

37:14.278 --> 37:15.580
there's this. What's that?

37:16.346 --> 37:18.149
You see these scratches? Yeah.

37:18.215 --> 37:20.520
They're made by
a top-feeding clip.

37:20.585 --> 37:23.357
Modern rifles use
a bottom-feeding magazine.

37:23.421 --> 37:25.592
Hey, I didn't know if you
were gonna catch that one.

37:25.657 --> 37:28.329
Well, that's why you left it
behind for us, wasn't it, William?

37:28.394 --> 37:30.832
See, these marks
from the stripper clip,

37:30.896 --> 37:32.399
plus the caliber
of the cartridge,

37:32.465 --> 37:36.072
clearly indicate it came from an
M1, a World War Il-vintage rifle.

37:36.136 --> 37:39.309
Which, of course, is the war
that William fought in.

37:39.373 --> 37:40.441
Exactly.

37:41.275 --> 37:43.613
So you're the one
who shot at us.

37:43.878 --> 37:46.416
You two are pretty good
at this game!

37:46.548 --> 37:47.716
Say, I never would've hit you.

37:47.782 --> 37:50.053
I'm a damned good shot,
if I say so myself.

37:50.118 --> 37:52.189
So it's been voyeurism
all along.

37:52.255 --> 37:53.390
What?

37:53.456 --> 37:54.491
Voyeurism.

37:54.557 --> 37:57.597
He wanted to observe us
without being seen himself.

37:57.660 --> 38:00.699
It's a common trait among
people who pretend to be dead.

38:00.764 --> 38:03.503
You see, they like to hang around
to see what happens afterwards.

38:04.336 --> 38:05.638
Wait just a doggone minute.

38:05.703 --> 38:06.738
That makes perfect sense.

38:06.805 --> 38:08.005
And it's obvious why he did it.

38:08.039 --> 38:09.241
Obvious? Exactly! Yes.

38:09.307 --> 38:11.512
Because he's a self-made man,

38:11.577 --> 38:13.614
and then he has
these rotten relatives...

38:13.679 --> 38:16.083
He pretends to die, hoping
his kids will band together

38:16.148 --> 38:17.317
and learn something
about real life.

38:17.384 --> 38:18.486
Don't be such a smart guy!

38:18.552 --> 38:20.690
But his little experiment
goes over like a lead Edsel.

38:21.855 --> 38:24.227
And there he is,
stuck being dead,

38:24.292 --> 38:26.062
and that's where we come in.

38:26.127 --> 38:28.932
You know, Susan,
you really are very good.

38:29.731 --> 38:31.501
Well... No. I really mean it.

38:31.567 --> 38:33.939
And I think
I owe you an apology.

38:34.003 --> 38:36.943
Just 'cause I don't take
Lucky Steele seriously

38:37.007 --> 38:39.144
doesn't mean I shouldn't
have taken you seriously.

38:40.210 --> 38:41.346
Why, Thomas...

38:41.412 --> 38:44.952
No. You've made some very
clever deductions on this case.

38:46.485 --> 38:49.490
Well, when you work
with the best,

38:50.222 --> 38:53.061
your game is bound
to go up a notch or two.

38:53.493 --> 38:56.198
Hello? Pardon me for intruding,

38:56.329 --> 38:58.166
but if I'm gonna be
resurrected today,

38:58.231 --> 39:00.134
we'd better get back
to the boat.

39:01.268 --> 39:04.440
Well, partner, I think
we just solved a case.

39:04.539 --> 39:06.643
We definitely solved a case.

39:07.342 --> 39:09.079
What do you mean
you solved the case?

39:09.544 --> 39:11.080
Did you find the will, Thomas?

39:11.146 --> 39:13.451
No, Melissa,
it's been destroyed.

39:13.516 --> 39:14.986
You found evidence
against Melissa?

39:15.051 --> 39:17.355
No, Arthur, I'm sorry, I didn't.

39:18.288 --> 39:22.129
Thomas, please don't toy with me.
You know how it upsets me.

39:22.192 --> 39:24.430
All right, here's our solution.

39:27.432 --> 39:28.601
Daddy?

39:29.267 --> 39:30.637
Oh, my God!

39:36.576 --> 39:37.678
Where were you?

39:37.744 --> 39:39.949
It's a long story, honey.
A long story.

39:41.247 --> 39:42.750
For once you got
nothing to say, huh?

39:42.816 --> 39:44.152
Well, this is a great day!

39:44.218 --> 39:46.255
You can't imagine
how much I missed you.

39:46.887 --> 39:48.757
Do all your cases
turn out like this?

39:48.823 --> 39:50.159
Of course.

40:11.416 --> 40:13.019
Drop it, Arthur.

40:18.257 --> 40:21.464
I was wondering when you were
gonna get around to this, Arthur.

40:21.528 --> 40:23.632
You were right, Mr. Magnum.

40:24.431 --> 40:26.702
But I'd give anything
if you hadn't been.

40:26.767 --> 40:28.972
Here you are! I wondered
where you got away...

40:29.670 --> 40:31.407
What is it, Thomas?

40:31.773 --> 40:32.908
What's going on?

40:32.974 --> 40:35.914
Your brother was about
to murder your father.

40:36.578 --> 40:37.714
I knew it!

40:37.780 --> 40:39.517
Didn't I tell you
he was vicious?

40:39.582 --> 40:41.585
Thank God
you caught him, Thomas.

40:41.651 --> 40:45.091
Well, unfortunately, I've
also caught his accomplice.

40:45.656 --> 40:46.657
You.

40:46.790 --> 40:47.826
Me?

40:50.695 --> 40:52.231
What are you talking about?

40:52.964 --> 40:56.303
Well, your job was to keep me
occupied until I heard shots,

40:56.368 --> 40:57.504
and then I'd rush in,

40:57.570 --> 40:59.440
and I guess Arthur
would shoot me, too.

40:59.505 --> 41:01.375
That is crazy, Thomas.

41:02.476 --> 41:04.078
You know how much
you mean to me.

41:04.144 --> 41:06.749
I could never do anything
to hurt you.

41:07.548 --> 41:09.586
It won't work
this time, Melissa.

41:09.651 --> 41:11.388
I'm turning you in.

41:12.387 --> 41:13.923
Please, Thomas.

41:14.322 --> 41:16.125
Please don't do this.

41:16.258 --> 41:18.228
We can be happy together.

41:19.663 --> 41:21.400
I'm sorry, Melissa.

41:21.731 --> 41:24.169
Not as sorry
as you're going to be.

41:24.734 --> 41:27.239
Great job, Lissy!

41:27.304 --> 41:29.942
Shut up, Artie, and get
back over there with them!

41:30.007 --> 41:31.008
But we're partners,
aren't we, Lis?

41:31.075 --> 41:33.379
Ha! And you were gonna dump
me just as soon as you could,

41:33.445 --> 41:34.480
so forget it.

41:34.546 --> 41:36.383
Well, Mr. Magnum,
it seems as though

41:36.448 --> 41:39.822
I've finally gotten my children
to work together on something.

41:39.886 --> 41:41.823
Well, don't worry
about it, William.

41:41.888 --> 41:44.928
See, Melissa has forgotten

41:45.925 --> 41:48.029
that I work with a partner.

41:48.395 --> 41:51.134
In fact, Susan has you
covered right now.

41:53.335 --> 41:54.937
Nice try, Thomas.

41:55.003 --> 41:58.810
You don't think I'd leave a potential
murder victim unguarded, do you?

41:59.909 --> 42:02.481
Okay, Susan,
you can come out now.

42:10.020 --> 42:11.423
This is it, Susan!

42:11.955 --> 42:13.325
Pick your spot!

42:14.726 --> 42:18.201
Just so we can end this
little charade, Thomas,

42:18.497 --> 42:22.906
I want you to go over there and open
that closet door very carefully.

42:23.470 --> 42:24.638
The closet?

42:24.704 --> 42:25.872
Go on!

42:30.411 --> 42:32.883
If Susan were in the closet,

42:34.282 --> 42:37.188
it wouldn't be a very
good time to shoot,

42:37.319 --> 42:39.757
because I'd be
in the line of fire.

42:39.889 --> 42:41.157
No, sir.

42:41.223 --> 42:44.463
Don't shoot when I open
the door of the closet.

42:46.897 --> 42:49.335
Freeze, tramp,
or you're wallpaper.

42:50.234 --> 42:53.006
I told you
to hide in the closet!

42:53.404 --> 42:54.673
I know!

42:54.739 --> 42:59.081
But Lucky always says to pick the
most bizarre spot you can find.

43:00.011 --> 43:01.414
All right, Melissa,

43:01.480 --> 43:03.717
I strongly suggest
that you drop that gun,

43:03.783 --> 43:06.021
because you've never been
one of my favorite people.

43:06.687 --> 43:07.855
I'm afraid not.

43:07.921 --> 43:10.059
You see, Thomas has entertained
me a couple of times

43:10.123 --> 43:12.293
with stories about how
bad you are with a gun.

43:17.599 --> 43:21.340
All right, Melissa, I want you
to pay very close attention.

43:28.012 --> 43:31.819
I guess I understated Susan's
skill a little for comic effect.

43:32.850 --> 43:33.885
Drop it.

43:33.951 --> 43:34.953
Don't do it.

43:35.020 --> 43:36.890
You have no idea how much
it hurts to be shot.

43:36.955 --> 43:39.527
I mean the bullet
rips into the flesh,

43:39.591 --> 43:41.428
and then it
tumbles around, it's...

43:42.227 --> 43:44.030
All right!
Just shut up about it!

43:44.096 --> 43:47.203
Please, Melissa, put it down. It
won't do you any good anyway.

43:47.266 --> 43:49.938
OO I married Louise.

43:50.003 --> 43:51.539
Your secretary?

43:53.073 --> 43:54.275
Arthur?

43:55.777 --> 43:56.945
Artie!

43:57.612 --> 44:00.117
Oh, Artie!

44:05.388 --> 44:07.024
Nice right cross.

44:07.858 --> 44:11.332
And that was about the most
amazing shot I've ever seen.

44:12.229 --> 44:14.968
Well, actually
I was aiming for the lamp.

44:15.400 --> 44:18.305
I figured you could jump
Melissa in the dark.

44:20.005 --> 44:22.142
You've had so much practice.

44:24.676 --> 44:28.518
I can't believe Lucky Steele
has a placement service!

44:29.649 --> 44:30.918
Isn't it great?

44:30.985 --> 44:33.022
Thomas, if I do well
in this interview,

44:33.087 --> 44:36.260
I'll be a private
investigator in Los Angeles!

44:36.524 --> 44:38.394
But, Susan, you could make
a living here.

44:38.459 --> 44:41.766
L.A. is so exciting, Thomas.

44:42.130 --> 44:44.835
I'll have an office
on Wilshire Boulevard,

44:44.901 --> 44:47.706
with a glass door
and a ceiling fan,

44:47.970 --> 44:50.776
and a male secretary
I'll call "Doll Face."

44:51.642 --> 44:54.180
I'd better go.
I don't wanna be late.

44:55.914 --> 44:59.521
Well, just don't go getting
locked up in any small rooms

44:59.584 --> 45:01.054
with anybody else but me.

45:03.823 --> 45:05.726
I wouldn't dream of it.

45:06.492 --> 45:10.767
Thomas, if you ever need me
to help you out with a case,

45:11.097 --> 45:15.607
that's all you have to do, is just pick
up the longhorn and give me a jingle,

45:15.736 --> 45:18.508
and I'll be here before you
can say, "Book 'em, Danno."

45:21.643 --> 45:23.680
I'm gonna miss you, Susan.

45:25.180 --> 45:26.382
Me, too.

45:33.824 --> 45:34.825
J Well

45:36.393 --> 45:38.029
so long, partner.

45:41.933 --> 45:43.001
You didn't...

45:44.603 --> 45:47.876
It's a little tricky.
You better let me.
