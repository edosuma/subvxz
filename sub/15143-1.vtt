08:26.166 --> 08:27.917
You rock those better than me.

08:30.875 --> 08:33.750
- Dicky.

08:33.792 --> 08:35.917
We have to take this

08:33.792 --> 08:35.917
seriously,

08:35.959 --> 08:38.375
and that's why I've come up

08:35.959 --> 08:38.375
with a schedule

08:38.417 --> 08:41.542
of doggy caretaking duties.

08:41.583 --> 08:43.458
Ta-da!

08:43.500 --> 08:48.041
- That's a very nice

08:43.500 --> 08:48.041
chore chart.

08:48.083 --> 08:52.000
Of course it's not as nice

08:48.083 --> 08:52.000
as mine.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.250
Ta-double-da.

08:58.375 --> 09:00.166
- Wow.

09:00.208 --> 09:03.625
Those four seconds are really

09:00.208 --> 09:03.625
killing you, aren't they?

09:03.667 --> 09:05.083
- I just think my way

09:05.125 --> 09:06.875
is the best way

09:05.125 --> 09:06.875
of taking of care of Chip.

09:06.917 --> 09:08.542
- [buzzer sound] Ehh!

09:06.917 --> 09:08.542
We're not naming him Chip.

09:08.583 --> 09:11.709
- That's right.

09:08.583 --> 09:11.709
His name is Tiny Elvis.

09:11.750 --> 09:14.083
- He doesn't look anything

09:11.750 --> 09:14.083
like Elvis.

09:14.125 --> 09:16.667
- He will when I put him in...

09:16.709 --> 09:19.125
This.

09:19.166 --> 09:20.625
- Um, he's not wearing that.

09:20.667 --> 09:23.208
He's wearing...this.

09:25.792 --> 09:28.667
And his name

09:25.792 --> 09:28.667
is Admiral Squishy Paws.

09:31.625 --> 09:33.917
- Clearly he's a Gary!

09:33.959 --> 09:35.208
All: Gary?

09:35.250 --> 09:38.417
[all speaking at once]

09:38.458 --> 09:42.208
- Gary stinks!

09:38.458 --> 09:42.208
- It's the perfect name.

09:42.250 --> 09:43.417
- He's Tiny Elvis!

09:43.458 --> 09:45.792
- [whistles]

09:45.834 --> 09:48.166
We're doing exactly what

09:45.834 --> 09:48.166
Mom and Dad said we would.

09:48.208 --> 09:51.000
- Sweet.

09:48.208 --> 09:51.000
- No, not sweet.

09:51.041 --> 09:53.000
We have to work together.

09:53.041 --> 09:55.750
That's why I'm willing

09:53.041 --> 09:55.750
to follow...

09:55.792 --> 09:56.834
[gagging]

09:56.875 --> 09:58.458
Ricky's lead.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.125
- I thought you might,

10:00.166 --> 10:03.959
and that's why I created

10:00.166 --> 10:03.959
a picture to represent that.

10:05.959 --> 10:08.291
- This is gonna be totally

10:05.959 --> 10:08.291
easy.

10:09.875 --> 10:13.583
This is so hard.

10:13.625 --> 10:18.709
- This is the longest week

10:13.625 --> 10:18.709
ever.

10:18.750 --> 10:22.625
- It's only been two hours.

10:22.667 --> 10:24.875
[dog whining]

10:22.667 --> 10:24.875
- He needs to go out.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.250
- How can you tell?

10:27.291 --> 10:28.709
[whines]

10:28.750 --> 10:31.041
- Those are his

10:28.750 --> 10:31.041
"I have to pee" ears.

10:35.166 --> 10:37.166
- It's not my turn to walk him.

10:37.208 --> 10:40.750
- Not mine.

10:40.792 --> 10:44.583
- Ugh, I guess I'll be

10:40.792 --> 10:44.583
the responsible one.

10:44.625 --> 10:46.083
- No way, I'm the leader.

10:46.125 --> 10:48.041
I'm the responsible one.

10:48.083 --> 10:50.208
- Don't you be more responsible

10:48.083 --> 10:50.208
than me!

10:50.250 --> 10:52.041
- Hold on!

10:52.083 --> 10:54.959
It's cape weather!

10:55.000 --> 10:56.792
- Man, they're so easy.

11:02.875 --> 11:04.458
- It's wonderful, isn't it?

11:04.500 --> 11:05.709
- It's overwhelming.

11:05.750 --> 11:06.959
- [sighs]

11:07.000 --> 11:09.375
This week has been amazing.

11:09.417 --> 11:11.375
- Glorious.

11:11.417 --> 11:13.917
- I just never thought

11:11.417 --> 11:13.917
I'd see this day.

11:13.959 --> 11:15.709
- It's like a dream come true.

11:17.291 --> 11:19.291
[both sniffling,

11:17.291 --> 11:19.291
sighing]

11:21.041 --> 11:22.375
Love you, Brownie.

11:25.583 --> 11:28.250
- Is Mom still

11:25.583 --> 11:28.250
looking over here?

11:28.291 --> 11:31.333
- I can't fake this smile

11:28.291 --> 11:31.333
much longer.

11:33.250 --> 11:37.041
- I'm so sick of you guys...

11:37.083 --> 11:39.917
But if we make it through today,

11:39.959 --> 11:43.166
Squishy Paws

11:39.959 --> 11:43.166
will be staying with us forever.

11:43.208 --> 11:46.250
- I think the person who's

11:43.208 --> 11:46.250
actually done his chores all

11:43.208 --> 11:46.250
week

11:46.291 --> 11:50.041
should get to name the dog.

11:50.083 --> 11:54.208
- I thought we settled on Gary.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.542
- And she's gone.

11:55.583 --> 11:57.375
- Gary is not a dog name.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.125
- It's better than Tiny Elvis.

11:59.166 --> 12:01.417
- Well, this foam bat

11:59.166 --> 12:01.417
says it isn't.

12:01.458 --> 12:02.417
- [hoarsely]

12:01.458 --> 12:02.417
Let's end this.

12:02.458 --> 12:04.208
- Quad bat fight!

12:04.250 --> 12:06.417
- Aah!

12:04.250 --> 12:06.417
Gary!

12:06.458 --> 12:09.542
- Tiny Elvis!

12:06.458 --> 12:09.542
- Gary!

12:06.458 --> 12:09.542
[overlapping shouting]

12:09.583 --> 12:11.750
- Chip! Chip!

12:09.583 --> 12:11.750
[overlapping shouts]

12:11.792 --> 12:13.291
- Tiny Elvis!

12:15.417 --> 12:16.458
- Tiny El--

12:21.458 --> 12:24.667
both: No!

12:21.458 --> 12:24.667
- Dad's jersey!

12:24.709 --> 12:26.542
- Oh, no!

12:31.667 --> 12:33.000
- Phew, that was close.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.000
- Phew.

12:33.041 --> 12:34.834
- Phew.

12:33.041 --> 12:34.834
- Sorry, Hazel.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.458
- Uh--I'm okay.

12:39.875 --> 12:41.917
[all scream]

12:41.959 --> 12:43.125
- Look what you did!

12:43.166 --> 12:44.458
- You called quad bat fight!

12:44.500 --> 12:46.291
- You started it!

12:44.500 --> 12:46.291
- You started it--

12:46.333 --> 12:47.875
[gasps]

12:47.917 --> 12:49.291
- Oh, no.

12:49.333 --> 12:50.917
- At least his ears aren't--

12:49.333 --> 12:50.917
uh...

12:55.792 --> 12:59.834
- Put down your pee ears

12:55.792 --> 12:59.834
and step away from the jersey.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.667
[all scream]

13:03.709 --> 13:06.500
[urine pattering]

13:03.709 --> 13:06.500
[all groan]

13:14.417 --> 13:16.166
- Is it coming off?

13:16.208 --> 13:19.250
- [hacks] I can't tell over

13:16.208 --> 13:19.250
the smell of your lunch.

13:19.291 --> 13:23.000
Can you maybe lean back

13:19.291 --> 13:23.000
until you hit a mint?

13:23.041 --> 13:24.583
- No big deal.

13:24.625 --> 13:26.709
Chip just went number one

13:24.625 --> 13:26.709
on dad's number 2.

13:26.750 --> 13:29.000
- Normally I'd laugh at that,

13:26.750 --> 13:29.000
but--

13:29.041 --> 13:32.000
no, it's still funny.

13:32.041 --> 13:32.917
- No, it's not.

13:32.959 --> 13:34.125
My life is over.

13:34.166 --> 13:35.917
- Come on, you guys!

13:35.959 --> 13:37.667
If we handle this right,

13:35.959 --> 13:37.667
dad doesn't have to find out,

13:37.709 --> 13:39.667
and we get to keep the dog.

13:39.709 --> 13:41.208
- What's the point?

13:41.250 --> 13:43.166
- It's over.

13:41.250 --> 13:43.166
- I failed.

13:43.208 --> 13:45.125
I'm a horrible leader!

13:47.083 --> 13:49.166
[thwack]

13:47.083 --> 13:49.166
All: Ow!

13:49.208 --> 13:52.375
- You could have used the side

13:49.208 --> 13:52.375
without the price tag.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.291
- We're Harpers.

13:57.333 --> 14:00.959
Did we give up when Nicky got

13:57.333 --> 14:00.959
his head stuck in the railing?

14:01.000 --> 14:05.208
Did we give up when Dicky got

14:01.000 --> 14:05.208
his head stuck in the railing?

14:05.250 --> 14:07.458
Did we give up

14:05.250 --> 14:07.458
when we were having trouble

14:07.500 --> 14:09.959
getting Ricky's head

14:07.500 --> 14:09.959
stuck in the railing?

14:12.083 --> 14:15.834
No!

14:12.083 --> 14:15.834
So we're not giving up now!

14:15.875 --> 14:17.375
We may have failed each other,

14:17.417 --> 14:19.166
but for the first time

14:17.417 --> 14:19.166
in our lives,

14:19.208 --> 14:21.166
we need to think of something

14:19.208 --> 14:21.166
bigger than the four of us.

14:23.959 --> 14:25.709
This guy.

14:25.750 --> 14:28.834
He deserves a good home,

14:25.750 --> 14:28.834
even if we don't deserve him.

14:30.083 --> 14:31.667
- [sniffles]

14:36.208 --> 14:40.250
All: Ah, Harper!

14:40.291 --> 14:43.500
- So this is programmed

14:40.291 --> 14:43.500
to control the snowball launcher

14:43.542 --> 14:45.667
in the winter sports area,

14:43.542 --> 14:45.667
hmm?

14:45.709 --> 14:47.667
And from now on, Kenny...

14:49.208 --> 14:52.333
You're in...

14:52.375 --> 14:54.000
Charge of it.

15:02.041 --> 15:03.041
Good stuff.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.792
- All right, Nicky, Ricky.

15:06.834 --> 15:08.834
You two take the jersey home

15:06.834 --> 15:08.834
and clean it.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.041
Dicky, you walk the dog.

15:11.083 --> 15:12.834
I'll keep dad away from this

15:11.083 --> 15:12.834
until you get back.

15:12.875 --> 15:13.875
Hurry!

15:18.417 --> 15:20.250
- Hey, kiddo.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.250
What's up with the blanket?

15:20.291 --> 15:23.959
- Oh, I was just doing a little

15:20.291 --> 15:23.959
research on antique jerseys,

15:24.000 --> 15:25.709
and it turns out they fade

15:25.750 --> 15:27.792
if they're exposed

15:25.750 --> 15:27.792
to too much sunlight.

15:27.834 --> 15:30.667
It'll wash those days of yore

15:27.834 --> 15:30.667
right off your old number 2.

15:32.458 --> 15:33.875
So until the danger's passed,

15:33.917 --> 15:36.750
I'm gonna

15:33.917 --> 15:36.750
blanket her up real nice.

15:36.792 --> 15:38.333
- Thank you, honey.

15:38.375 --> 15:40.000
You know, that's the kind

15:38.375 --> 15:40.000
of responsibility

15:40.041 --> 15:42.000
that's gonna make Gary Chip

15:40.041 --> 15:42.000
Tiny Elvis Squishy Paws

15:42.041 --> 15:44.542
a permanent part of this family.

15:44.583 --> 15:46.333
- You can count on me, Dad!

15:52.000 --> 15:54.333
- Hey, ladies.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.333
You like puppies?

15:57.333 --> 15:58.500
- It's 1:19.

15:58.542 --> 15:59.917
They've been gone so long,

15:59.959 --> 16:02.792
it's like time is

15:59.959 --> 16:02.792
moving backwards.

16:02.834 --> 16:04.750
- You're holding your phone

16:02.834 --> 16:04.750
upside down.

16:04.792 --> 16:06.959
- It's 6:11!

16:09.000 --> 16:11.375
Finally!

16:09.000 --> 16:11.375
- Sorry.

16:11.417 --> 16:13.083
Mom was home, so we had to

16:11.417 --> 16:13.083
go to the laundromat.

16:13.125 --> 16:14.333
- Is it clean?

16:14.375 --> 16:16.875
- Not bad for such a busy

16:14.375 --> 16:16.875
place.

16:16.917 --> 16:19.500
- Not the laundromat,

16:16.917 --> 16:19.500
the shirt!

16:21.500 --> 16:22.959
It looks great!

16:23.000 --> 16:24.542
- Where's the signature?

16:29.166 --> 16:31.291
- Where's the signature?

16:31.333 --> 16:33.125
- It must have washed off!

16:33.166 --> 16:35.583
- Oh, I knew that machine

16:33.166 --> 16:35.583
was too strong.

16:35.625 --> 16:38.834
That delicate setting is a joke!

16:38.875 --> 16:42.667
- Okay, so we just

16:38.875 --> 16:42.667
need to re-write the

16:38.875 --> 16:42.667
signature.

16:42.709 --> 16:43.625
- Wait, before you do

16:42.709 --> 16:43.625
anything--

16:43.667 --> 16:45.750
- No more waity-waity.

16:45.792 --> 16:48.792
I've been looking

16:45.792 --> 16:48.792
at that signature all week.

16:48.834 --> 16:52.709
Brownie Wilson's signature

16:48.834 --> 16:52.709
is burned into my brain.

16:52.750 --> 16:53.959
There.

16:57.583 --> 17:00.500
- Who's Brownie Squishy Paws?

17:03.583 --> 17:06.792
- You wrote,

17:03.583 --> 17:06.792
"Brownie Squishy Paws."

17:06.834 --> 17:09.917
- It just came out!

17:06.834 --> 17:09.917
- Why would that just come out?

17:09.959 --> 17:12.208
- I practiced that name all

17:09.959 --> 17:12.208
day!

17:12.250 --> 17:14.917
- You want the price tag

17:12.250 --> 17:14.917
or all leather?

17:17.625 --> 17:19.250
- It's over.

17:19.291 --> 17:21.250
That's it.

17:21.291 --> 17:22.667
I failed.

17:24.250 --> 17:27.000
I'm sorry, Squishy Paws.

17:27.041 --> 17:28.625
I let you down.

17:28.667 --> 17:30.625
- You're giving up?

17:30.667 --> 17:34.458
- Where's the girl

17:30.667 --> 17:34.458
who rubbed butter on my face to

17:30.667 --> 17:34.458
pop me out of that railing?

17:34.500 --> 17:37.250
- And where's the girl

17:34.500 --> 17:37.250
who decided to stop pulling

17:37.291 --> 17:39.834
and just push me

17:37.291 --> 17:39.834
right through that railing?

17:41.333 --> 17:44.083
- And where's the girl

17:41.333 --> 17:44.083
who pinned my arms down

17:44.125 --> 17:46.542
while Dicky and Nicky

17:44.125 --> 17:46.542
jammed my head into that railing

17:46.583 --> 17:47.834
for laughing at them?

17:50.166 --> 17:51.959
- I'm right here.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.667
- Good, 'cause our team

17:52.000 --> 17:55.667
could kind of use a leader.

18:01.041 --> 18:02.959
- Nicky,

18:01.041 --> 18:02.959
can you get the marker out?

18:03.000 --> 18:05.083
- I say this

18:03.000 --> 18:05.083
with full certainty:

18:07.709 --> 18:10.500
possibly.

18:10.542 --> 18:13.166
To the cafe!

18:13.208 --> 18:15.542
This is my own formula.

18:15.583 --> 18:19.792
It's super strong,

18:15.583 --> 18:19.792
so a few drops is all we need.

18:46.750 --> 18:50.291
has some important work things

18:50.333 --> 18:52.041
to do all the way over there.

18:52.083 --> 18:56.458
- Yep. Work, work, work.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.208
- He's a great kid.

18:58.250 --> 19:00.083
You know,

18:58.250 --> 19:00.083
we almost named him Gary,

19:00.125 --> 19:02.333
but we couldn't think of three

19:00.125 --> 19:02.333
other names that rhymed with it.

What are you doing here?

19:10.417 --> 19:12.458

19:12.500 --> 19:14.208
- And now you see one.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.208
Now you don't.

No, I didn't.

over the dog's name and--

- Oh, big surprise!

See, I thought you guys

were finally working together,

Of course!

We screwed up,

with a better plan.

21:14.250 --> 21:16.917

21:16.959 --> 21:18.583
- Well, after the dog

21:16.959 --> 21:18.583
peed on the jersey,

21:18.625 --> 21:20.000
we thought we could clean

21:18.625 --> 21:20.000
it...

21:20.041 --> 21:21.667

21:21.709 --> 21:23.542

21:21.709 --> 21:23.542
go to the laundromat...

- And we washed

21:23.583 --> 21:26.375
the signature off...

21:26.417 --> 21:30.542
hit Hazel with snowballs...

21:26.417 --> 21:30.542
- And no matter what we did,

21:26.417 --> 21:30.542
we just made things worse.

21:30.583 --> 21:34.250
- So you guys

21:30.583 --> 21:34.250
did all this together?

21:48.166 --> 21:51.667
I've ever been yelled at.

21:53.208 --> 21:55.166
- But we ruined Dad's jersey

21:53.208 --> 21:55.166
and tried to cover it up.

cover it up together.
