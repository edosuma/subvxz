02:15.875 --> 02:17.103
Youngja!

02:17.577 --> 02:18.577
Yes?

02:19.812 --> 02:22.542
You know what
my dream was as a boy?

02:24.083 --> 02:25.414
No, tell me.

02:28.588 --> 02:29.680
To be a captain...

02:31.190 --> 02:34.421
steering a big ship like that.

02:35.061 --> 02:36.289
Really?

02:37.763 --> 02:40.323
How come you never told me?

02:41.267 --> 02:42.928
I never knew that.

02:44.036 --> 02:46.561
Ah, what's the point...

02:47.506 --> 02:49.872
I did tell you once.

02:57.950 --> 02:59.611
Oh my!

02:59.886 --> 03:05.222
You need to look after yourself
when you get old.

03:05.825 --> 03:09.591
Eat the porridge I made you,
then don't forget your pills.

03:10.363 --> 03:14.390
Why don't you stay home today?
Our kids are coming.

03:15.935 --> 03:16.993
What's that?

03:17.270 --> 03:18.270
Are they here?

03:18.304 --> 03:19.404
Grandma!

03:19.405 --> 03:23.273
Oh, it's my munchkins!

03:23.709 --> 03:25.609
- Our munchkins are here!
- Going somewhere?

03:26.012 --> 03:27.570
- Dad!
- We're here.

03:28.614 --> 03:31.378
- Mom, what's wrong?
- Are you sick?

03:31.651 --> 03:32.884
It's nothing, just a cold.

03:32.885 --> 03:37.555
Dad, can't you look
after her better?

03:37.556 --> 03:41.493
You should take her to a doctor!
These damned pills won't help.

03:41.494 --> 03:43.394
I can't believe you!

03:44.897 --> 03:46.797
Where are you going this time?

03:46.999 --> 03:49.263
A guy Kim knows
invited us to Thailand.

03:49.602 --> 03:50.902
- Thailand?
- Yeah.

03:50.903 --> 03:53.705
So sorry,
I wish you could join us!

03:53.706 --> 03:55.230
Yeah, me too.

03:55.508 --> 03:58.909
Seo-yeon, listen to your grandparents
and don't cause trouble.

03:59.312 --> 04:01.303
Mom, thanks for watching them.

04:01.414 --> 04:02.847
This is for the memorial.

04:02.915 --> 04:05.050
Sure, don't worry
and have fun there.

04:05.051 --> 04:06.618
- Let's go!
- Gosh,

04:06.619 --> 04:08.520
I feel so guilty
going off by ourselves.

04:08.521 --> 04:10.079
Then don't go.

04:11.090 --> 04:12.857
See you on the day of the memorial.

04:12.858 --> 04:15.860
Okay, have fun
on your family outing.

04:15.861 --> 04:17.062
- Bye, Mom!
- Bye bye!

04:17.063 --> 04:18.325
Goodbye, Dad.

04:24.203 --> 04:27.070
Family outing my ass.

04:27.340 --> 04:28.932
Aren't we family?

04:29.241 --> 04:30.538
Oh my!

04:30.676 --> 04:32.007
What?

04:35.381 --> 04:37.749
Get out, you bastards! Beat it!

04:37.750 --> 04:40.378
Grandpa, please,
let's talk this over.

04:40.519 --> 04:44.182
Who are you calling Grandpa?
Am I your Grandpa?

04:44.290 --> 04:45.917
That's not what I meant,
Grandpa.

04:46.058 --> 04:49.527
We just suggest you sign while
the price we're offering is good.

04:49.528 --> 04:52.429
Sign? Take this for a sign!

04:53.265 --> 04:56.534
I won't sell this store
until they shovel dirt on me!

04:56.535 --> 04:58.469
You really won't listen to reason.

04:58.738 --> 05:00.865
It's no use anyway, Grandpa.

05:00.973 --> 05:05.000
Now that the law's changed,
if 80% of the merchants agree,

05:05.077 --> 05:07.712
it'll be expropriated
whether you sign or not.

05:07.713 --> 05:09.806
Scram, you bastards!

05:10.750 --> 05:12.784
You <i>dirty</i> crooks!

05:12.785 --> 05:14.013
You didn't have to throw it.

05:14.153 --> 05:15.916
All right, Grandpa, we'll go.

05:16.022 --> 05:17.114
See you tomorrow.

05:18.457 --> 05:20.891
Old man just won't listen.

05:23.829 --> 05:25.363
Hey, you there!

05:25.364 --> 05:27.195
You can't park here!
Move your car!

05:27.333 --> 05:28.366
Just 5 minutes.

05:28.367 --> 05:30.096
Think you own this market?

05:32.238 --> 05:35.640
Look, we can't do business
without unloading goods.

05:35.641 --> 05:37.871
- What?
- Why are you so selfish?

05:38.477 --> 05:41.310
You hold out selling your shop,
hurting all of us,

05:41.414 --> 05:43.006
now you won't let us unload?

05:43.149 --> 05:44.776
You want us to starve?

05:45.117 --> 05:46.175
Move it, quick!

05:49.955 --> 05:51.252
What are you staring at?!

05:56.962 --> 05:58.054
Grandpa!

05:58.497 --> 06:03.457
Don't be angry, Grandpa.
I'm scared when you're angry.

06:03.903 --> 06:04.961
All right.

06:05.471 --> 06:10.340
Grandpa, I was reading just now,
what does 'memory' mean?

06:11.377 --> 06:12.537
'Memory.'

06:15.047 --> 06:16.537
This sort of thing's memory.

06:17.216 --> 06:19.684
Thinking about the old days.

06:19.819 --> 06:21.853
Things you can't forget.

06:21.854 --> 06:23.788
What about 'gigabyte'?

06:28.561 --> 06:29.561
Let's go.

06:29.895 --> 06:34.923
Don't be angry, Grandpa.
I'm scared when you're angry.

06:35.568 --> 06:39.304
Did you get angry
when you were little?

06:39.305 --> 06:40.101
No.

06:40.206 --> 06:42.868
Then what were you like?

06:43.876 --> 06:44.968
As a boy?

06:58.591 --> 06:59.888
Are you okay, Seo-yeon?

07:03.662 --> 07:05.323
No fooling around, I said!

07:05.564 --> 07:05.965
<i>December 1950
Hungnam, North Korea</i>

07:05.966 --> 07:07.765
<i>December 1950

Maksoon, you listen up good.

07:07.766 --> 07:08.334
<i>December 1950
Hungnam, North Korea</i>

07:08.335 --> 07:11.132
This is no playground.
We're not going for fun.

07:12.138 --> 07:14.766
Grab my hand tight, you hear?

07:16.642 --> 07:18.701
Duk-soo! Maksoon!

07:19.211 --> 07:24.012
Duk-soo, grab your sister's hand,
and stay close behind me, okay?

07:24.150 --> 07:25.583
Yes, Dad!

07:25.584 --> 07:26.812
Let's move.

07:26.952 --> 07:28.476
Go!

07:36.162 --> 07:37.254
You okay?

08:15.201 --> 08:16.361
Duk-soo...

08:35.520 --> 08:39.287
Oh no, the Chinese
must be right behind us.

08:40.793 --> 08:43.227
The Chinese have entered Hungnam!

08:46.599 --> 08:49.568
Hurry now. Don't get distracted!

08:49.635 --> 08:50.727
Maksoon, come down!

08:51.136 --> 08:53.229
Let's go, hurry.

08:55.474 --> 08:58.170
<i>The Chinese have broken through
and are entering into Hungnam!</i>

08:58.310 --> 09:01.609
<i>Evacuate the 7th Division units now!

<i>The Chinese have broken through

09:04.650 --> 09:07.312
<i>Pull back all

<i>Hooligan x-ray, Hooligan x-ray!</i>

09:33.145 --> 09:35.909
<i>This is Charlie Company.
Charlie Company on board, Sir!</i>

09:36.715 --> 09:38.580
Load the weapons!
There's no time!

09:38.684 --> 09:40.345
We have to move out in one hour!

09:41.320 --> 09:43.686
General! I beg you...

09:44.323 --> 09:46.057
Please have mercy
on these people.

09:46.058 --> 09:49.459
If you leave them like this,
there's only death left for them.

09:49.595 --> 09:52.359
The Chinese army could be
upon us any time now, sir!

10:07.279 --> 10:08.473
Hold this line!

10:08.580 --> 10:09.580
Hold the line!

10:09.715 --> 10:11.046
Roger, that's it.

10:11.150 --> 10:13.675
Shut the door and move out!
Let's go!

10:15.454 --> 10:17.752
Sir, please have mercy!

10:17.856 --> 10:19.790
Please save our people, sir!

10:37.276 --> 10:41.007
Captain, how many refugees
can we fit on this ship?

10:41.213 --> 10:42.213
Sir?

10:45.050 --> 10:47.452
The ship's fully loaded
with tanks and mortars, sir.

10:47.453 --> 10:49.387
We've got munitions on board sir!

10:49.388 --> 10:50.888
There's no room for the Koreans!

10:50.889 --> 10:52.156
<i>This is an order
from the General!</i>

10:52.157 --> 10:54.258
<i>Unload all arms

10:54.259 --> 10:55.988
<i>Let's have all refugees on board.</i>

11:43.342 --> 11:46.277
What if we can't board?

11:46.378 --> 11:49.541
No talk, just move quickly.
Come, follow me.

11:51.650 --> 11:54.016
Duk-soo!
Hold Maksoon's hand tight!

11:54.853 --> 11:55.853
Quickly!

11:59.291 --> 12:00.758
Ok-soon!

12:01.794 --> 12:02.988

12:26.885 --> 12:29.080
Duk-soo, I said to grab her hand!

12:29.221 --> 12:30.347
Get up, Maksoon.

12:30.522 --> 12:34.117
Everyone gather your wits!
Let's go.

Get up, quick.

- This way!
- I'm okay.

14:22.067 --> 14:24.168
- Stay there. Duk-soo!
- Darling!

14:32.311 --> 14:33.311
Yes!

14:35.213 --> 14:38.046
Maksoon! Listen up!

14:38.717 --> 14:41.914
This is no playground.
We're not going for fun.

14:42.020 --> 14:43.715
Grab my hand tight!

15:31.269 --> 15:33.066
I lost Maksoon.

15:33.138 --> 15:34.230
What?

15:34.606 --> 15:37.541
I'll go and get her.

15:38.076 --> 15:39.566
Go to your mother, quick.

15:39.645 --> 15:40.745
I'll find her.

15:40.746 --> 15:42.680
Dad!

15:42.948 --> 15:44.677
I'll go with you.

16:05.437 --> 16:06.802
Listen to me.

16:07.506 --> 16:10.532
If I don't come back,
you're the head of the family.

16:11.243 --> 16:14.644
That means whatever happens,
you put the family first, okay?

16:15.647 --> 16:17.945
Now that you're
the head of the family...

16:19.317 --> 16:20.841
look after them well.

16:22.254 --> 16:23.414

21:17.882 --> 21:20.908
- 10. You sure?
- Yes!

21:21.019 --> 21:23.887
Then what's 3+2?

21:23.888 --> 21:25.788
Hey, what's that?

21:26.224 --> 21:27.452
Sister.

21:32.831 --> 21:34.958
But where you from?

21:35.066 --> 21:36.090
Hungnam.

21:36.368 --> 21:38.859
Hungnam? Where's that?

21:39.270 --> 21:40.532
Up north.

21:40.638 --> 21:42.663
North? You a commie?

21:43.008 --> 21:45.238
You think all Northerners
are commies?

21:45.343 --> 21:47.641
You must be, from your temper.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.471
I told you I'm not a commie!

21:50.582 --> 21:51.606
Hey!

21:51.916 --> 21:53.247
Come up here, you!

21:53.618 --> 21:56.178
Why is there a commie
in math class?

21:56.488 --> 21:57.488
Get up here.

21:57.956 --> 21:58.690
Hello!

21:58.691 --> 21:59.884
Chocolate give me!

22:00.191 --> 22:01.225
Hey!

22:01.226 --> 22:03.990
Give me chocolate!

22:11.036 --> 22:13.937
Today's newspaper!

22:16.307 --> 22:18.707
So embarrassing.

22:19.310 --> 22:21.676
Do they have to act like beggars?

22:21.880 --> 22:24.114
That's why our country
stays poor.

22:24.115 --> 22:24.315
<i>Missing: Yoon Jin-gyu (father),
Yoon Maksoon (sister)</i>

22:24.316 --> 22:25.839
You're from the North?

22:26.751 --> 22:29.652
Me, too.
Tongcheon, Gangwon Province.

22:30.188 --> 22:31.951
What do you want to be?

22:32.624 --> 22:34.421
- A naval captain.
- Captain?

22:34.492 --> 22:38.724
I want to build ships.
Really big ones.

22:39.397 --> 22:41.627
How can you make
big ships in Korea?

22:41.833 --> 22:44.529
First you raise a lot of money,
and buy land.

22:44.869 --> 22:47.360
A lot of countries need big ships.

22:47.472 --> 22:49.770
So you show them
a photo of the land,

22:49.874 --> 22:54.140
and say, we'll build the ship
you need on this land.

22:54.245 --> 22:57.874
So buy a ship from us.

22:58.349 --> 22:59.650
Will that really work?

22:59.651 --> 23:01.016
Mr. Chung!

23:03.922 --> 23:07.915
There are trials,
but there is no failure.

23:15.066 --> 23:17.000
<i>Hyundai</i>

23:17.102 --> 23:19.070
Crazy fool.

23:19.337 --> 23:20.497
You said it.

23:20.705 --> 23:23.833
He might as well start
a Korean car company.

23:24.742 --> 23:28.735
With the world so messed up,
you see some strange people.

23:39.624 --> 23:42.286
Chocolate give me.
Chocolate give me.

23:44.329 --> 23:47.093
Chocolate give me.
Chocolate give me.

23:50.335 --> 23:51.335
What the hell?

23:51.669 --> 23:54.263
Okay, here.
Have the chocolate but go, okay?

23:54.806 --> 23:55.806
Get him!

23:56.808 --> 23:57.808
Go, run!

23:57.809 --> 23:58.809
Quick!

24:00.111 --> 24:01.111
Hey!

24:05.884 --> 24:07.681
- Duk-soo!
- Run, Dal-gu!

24:14.325 --> 24:15.349
Stop, you!

24:30.308 --> 24:31.308
Hey, you!

24:31.943 --> 24:33.467
Stop!

24:35.980 --> 24:38.574
<i>This is President Syngman Rhee.</i>

24:39.284 --> 24:45.814
<i>For me, armistice does not mean
that we fight any less,</i>

24:46.558 --> 24:51.655
<i>but ultimately means
more hardship and destruction.</i>

24:51.763 --> 24:53.822
Come out, you little punks!

24:55.667 --> 24:58.835
<i>I have been against the armistice...</i>

24:58.836 --> 25:00.303
what does "armistice" mean?

25:00.572 --> 25:03.132
Sounds like it means
not waging war.

25:03.708 --> 25:07.200
So we can go back
to our hometown?

25:08.379 --> 25:10.210
I don't think so.

25:10.315 --> 25:12.044
Why not?

25:12.584 --> 25:15.712
If the armistice ends the war,
why can't we go back?

25:15.820 --> 25:19.449
It's true we're not waging war,

25:19.724 --> 25:22.955
but that doesn't mean
the war's over.

25:23.628 --> 25:25.926
It needs to end first.

25:26.231 --> 25:28.859
- The war is too...
- You don't know, do you?

25:30.301 --> 25:32.769
- I mean...
- what's an armistice?

25:32.770 --> 25:35.000
What's an armistice?

25:35.139 --> 25:36.873
Can I go back to my hometown?

25:36.874 --> 25:38.068
Where's your hometown?

25:38.309 --> 25:40.573
Hamgyeong Province...
Hungnam, Cheongi-dong.

25:41.079 --> 25:42.376
You can't go back.

25:42.981 --> 25:45.849
Why not? The war's over.

25:45.850 --> 25:49.081
It's not over,
it's a cease fire.

25:49.854 --> 25:52.880
Our country's weak,
so other countries came in,

25:52.991 --> 25:56.757
and now they fight and
divide us up as they please.

25:57.228 --> 25:58.428
Those damn bastards!

25:58.429 --> 25:59.691
Come here, you!

26:04.869 --> 26:06.894
Hey! Spit it out!

26:07.472 --> 26:08.564
Kick them!

26:15.647 --> 26:20.175
<i>July 27, 1953
Armistice Agreement signed</i>

26:23.755 --> 26:26.189
what happened to you?

26:28.493 --> 26:31.553
In the middle of this chaos
I send you to school,

26:32.697 --> 26:35.962
and you go around
getting into fights?

26:36.467 --> 26:41.837
I wasn't fighting.
I just tripped while running.

26:42.674 --> 26:46.041
Now you lie to your mother?

26:46.477 --> 26:47.501
Mom.

26:48.880 --> 26:49.904
What?

26:51.082 --> 26:54.677
You hate me, don't you?

26:57.055 --> 26:58.113
Why?

26:59.057 --> 27:03.619
Then why didn't you mention
Maksoon even once?

27:07.932 --> 27:09.695
Duk-soo, let's imagine.

27:10.568 --> 27:12.798
Suppose our house is on fire.

27:13.404 --> 27:17.363
You're in the house,
and we're all outside.

27:18.276 --> 27:20.710
Then what should I do?

27:21.079 --> 27:24.242
Of course,
you'd come in to save me.

27:25.016 --> 27:26.108
No.

27:26.484 --> 27:31.148
If I die trying to save you,
who will feed your siblings?

27:33.358 --> 27:37.624
It tears my heart
to think of Maksoon,

27:38.696 --> 27:42.928
but now I have to look after
you and your siblings.

27:44.635 --> 27:46.000
Because...

27:47.839 --> 27:49.397
I'm a mother.

27:50.308 --> 27:52.139
That's what mothers have to do.

27:53.378 --> 27:56.643
But because of me, Dad...

27:56.914 --> 27:58.609
No, it's not your fault.

27:59.283 --> 28:02.377
Don't you worry over such things,
just study hard.

28:02.987 --> 28:07.890
Because you're the head of
the family until Dad comes back.

28:09.794 --> 28:11.056
You understand?

28:15.266 --> 28:17.097
Those damned thugs.

28:17.201 --> 28:20.762
Look at your face!

28:21.305 --> 28:23.205
You saw me restraining
myself yesterday?

28:23.574 --> 28:26.407
If I catch those punks again,
I'll beat them...

28:26.477 --> 28:27.477
Shut your trap.

28:27.578 --> 28:28.578
Okay.

28:31.749 --> 28:37.585
So, since the war's over,
you'll go back to your hometown?

28:37.822 --> 28:38.822
I guess so.

28:39.490 --> 28:43.051
Too bad. We just became friends.

28:43.628 --> 28:48.429
What do you mean, friends?
I'll probably never see you again.

28:48.800 --> 28:52.702
That's what you think.
I don't think that.

28:53.070 --> 28:57.905
What's this? Look at her wrist!
Go easy on her.

28:59.811 --> 29:03.110
And you just need to let go.

29:03.414 --> 29:06.679
You don't have many years left,
stop being so stubborn.

29:07.118 --> 29:08.983
Sell the store and
enjoy your earnings.

29:09.454 --> 29:12.014
Stop talking nonsense.

29:12.557 --> 29:13.557
Look at me.

29:13.624 --> 29:16.650
I sold my store and
put up this big building.

29:16.761 --> 29:19.093
It's called a multiplex.

29:19.664 --> 29:21.791
What would a beggar
like you know?

29:21.899 --> 29:24.459
I'm gonna rip
your mouth... damn you!

29:24.869 --> 29:26.860
Cursing in front of the kid.

29:28.806 --> 29:29.806
Old geezer.

29:30.842 --> 29:32.400
All done...

29:33.578 --> 29:35.170
Those migrants
are drinking coffee!

29:35.379 --> 29:36.869
Can you believe it?

29:37.181 --> 29:39.274
That's why their country
stays so poor.

29:40.651 --> 29:42.118
Hey, you! Don't insult us!

29:42.220 --> 29:43.220
Insult you?

29:43.321 --> 29:44.488
We didn't insult you.

29:44.489 --> 29:47.549
You did!
Nobody gave me this coffee!

29:47.658 --> 29:49.326
I bought it myself!

29:49.327 --> 29:50.555
What's the problem?

29:50.728 --> 29:53.526
Hey, he talks with an accent!

29:53.664 --> 29:54.426
Of course!

29:54.532 --> 29:57.267
I'm a Busan person,
so I speak Busan dialect.

29:57.268 --> 29:59.402
You're no Busan person,
you black bastard!

29:59.403 --> 30:01.564
If you live in Busan,
you're a Busan person!

30:01.672 --> 30:03.440
If you live in Korea,
you're a Korean!

30:03.441 --> 30:06.137
Now you're jabbering nonsense,
you bastard!

30:07.545 --> 30:08.910
Talk trash in your own country!

30:09.747 --> 30:11.009
Let go of him, you punks!

30:11.082 --> 30:14.643
What's it to you if he drinks
coffee or barley water?

30:14.819 --> 30:16.086
Hey, gramps!

30:16.087 --> 30:18.419
What's a low-grade migrant
like him doing in a cafe?

30:18.523 --> 30:21.390
A dirt poor beggar
working in another country!

30:21.492 --> 30:22.720
What?

30:22.793 --> 30:25.489
If you work in another country,
you can't drink coffee?

30:26.931 --> 30:29.195
Don't worry, Seo-yeon.

30:29.333 --> 30:32.700
Your grandfather's
just gone a bit senile.

30:34.205 --> 30:36.400
Soon he'll be painting on the wall.

30:36.541 --> 30:37.565
With his poop.

30:41.679 --> 30:42.839
You bastards!

30:43.080 --> 30:46.140
Penniless bastard!
Trying to sneak into class again!

30:46.484 --> 30:47.617
I'm warning you!

30:47.618 --> 30:50.553
If I catch you here once more,
you're in for it!

30:55.693 --> 30:57.320
You shouldn't throw books.

30:57.428 --> 30:59.259
- You bastard!
- Come on.

30:59.664 --> 31:03.031
It's because of beggars like him
that our country's poor!

31:05.870 --> 31:10.068
<i>Autumn 1963</i>

31:17.014 --> 31:18.641
- Oh, that's heavy.
- Hey, Beggar Boy!

31:19.116 --> 31:20.674
You slacking off again?

31:21.652 --> 31:22.812
How're your studies?

31:23.154 --> 31:25.520
Studies my ass...
out of the way.

31:27.058 --> 31:28.252
Beggar Boy.

31:28.659 --> 31:29.819
Damn.

31:30.394 --> 31:32.692
What? Something wrong?

31:34.031 --> 31:37.057
You need cash
if you want to study.

31:37.468 --> 31:39.197
You're earning cash now.

31:40.271 --> 31:41.966
Can't even feed myself.

31:42.573 --> 31:43.597
What do you mean?

31:45.810 --> 31:49.576
My aging mother's out there
selling things on the street,

31:49.680 --> 31:54.276
and Seung-gyu has to be
so damned good at his studies,

31:54.552 --> 31:55.780
the jerk.

31:56.787 --> 31:58.277
If you study well,
you're a jerk?

31:59.156 --> 32:03.115
Crazy bastard just got into
Seoul National University.

32:04.528 --> 32:05.688
Seoul National?

32:06.297 --> 32:08.595
Wow! Wow...

32:08.899 --> 32:11.265
what a jerk. Is he even human?

32:11.669 --> 32:14.365
Now we have to pay the tuition.

32:15.506 --> 32:18.566
I wish some money would fall from the sky.

32:20.711 --> 32:22.076
Maybe not the sky...

32:22.947 --> 32:24.505
but I know just the place.

32:24.949 --> 32:25.973
What?

32:32.857 --> 32:37.692
Work in Germany.
Miners needed. Miners?

32:43.834 --> 32:45.435
Squid and peanuts!

32:45.436 --> 32:47.336
Mister, one squid please.

32:50.207 --> 32:51.936
Are you crazy?

32:52.276 --> 32:55.609
Do you even
know where west Germany is?

32:55.880 --> 33:00.476
A miner? Gimme a break.
You can't even shovel.

33:00.885 --> 33:05.322
Duk-soo,
life is all about timing.

33:05.623 --> 33:07.284
There's a time for everything.

33:07.658 --> 33:09.125
You know what I mean?

33:09.260 --> 33:10.522
Let's go for just 3 years.

33:10.761 --> 33:12.922
I'm not going, dammit!

33:13.964 --> 33:16.533
The exam's
right around the corner.

33:16.534 --> 33:18.968
You can take it
when you get back.

33:19.070 --> 33:21.868
Seriously, who in your family
earns money besides you?

33:22.239 --> 33:24.298
How'll you pay
your brother's tuition?

33:24.809 --> 33:26.106
Making fish boxes?

33:26.243 --> 33:29.178
A million of those
won't pay his tuition.

33:31.549 --> 33:34.712
What's there to think about?
The answer's obvious.

33:36.487 --> 33:37.784
No way.

33:38.122 --> 33:39.953
After getting into that school?

33:40.291 --> 33:42.892
Not anyone can
work abroad as a miner.

33:42.893 --> 33:44.994
- Mom...
- She's right.

33:44.995 --> 33:46.462
Don't be ridiculous!

33:46.564 --> 33:49.099
You've never once even
gotten your hands <i>dirty.</i>

33:49.100 --> 33:51.762
A bookworm like you,
mining coal?

33:51.969 --> 33:54.460
- Even the dogs will be laughing.
- You be quiet!

33:55.639 --> 33:57.539
Can't I have my say?

33:57.908 --> 34:00.308
Anyway, don't you worry
about any of that.

34:00.478 --> 34:03.106
- Your brother's working hard.
- Mom.

34:03.681 --> 34:06.081
You know what people
are saying about him?

34:06.417 --> 34:09.614
He can't get educated
because of his needy family.

34:09.920 --> 34:12.480
Working himself to the bone
365 days a year.

34:13.724 --> 34:16.556
How can I accept that money?

34:18.529 --> 34:21.259
Shut your mouth, you!
You want a slap?

34:21.532 --> 34:22.692
Duk-soo...

34:23.199 --> 34:24.934
You just study at your university.

34:24.935 --> 34:28.335
Have you been drinking again?
God, I can't stand this!

34:28.405 --> 34:32.375
Life is about timing.
A right time for everything.

34:32.376 --> 34:35.110
You understand, you little punk?

34:35.112 --> 34:38.275
Whining at
your mother like that.

34:38.649 --> 34:41.014
Mom, I'm going to bed!

34:43.888 --> 34:44.980
He's just hopeless.

34:58.936 --> 35:00.403
Have a drink?

35:19.256 --> 35:21.349
All right, all right...

35:31.001 --> 35:36.530
Now we'll have the physical test for
west German mining applicants.

35:36.807 --> 35:38.942
- You see that rice sack?
- Yes!

35:38.943 --> 35:42.276
Now, just lift this sack
above your head.

35:42.613 --> 35:44.274
- Understood?
- Yes!

35:44.582 --> 35:46.277
Let's start with applicant 1.

35:52.223 --> 35:54.054
Failed. Next.

35:57.294 --> 35:59.819
Failed.
Why are you all such wimps?

36:00.231 --> 36:01.231
Next.

36:09.139 --> 36:10.663
Wait, wait!

36:10.774 --> 36:12.241
Wait, I can do it.

36:13.077 --> 36:14.237
Lift it!

36:20.284 --> 36:20.818
Fail.

36:20.819 --> 36:22.619
- It hasn't touched the ground!
- You're done.

36:22.620 --> 36:24.821
- I'm still...
- Failed. Next.

36:24.822 --> 36:25.822
Yes, sir.

36:34.765 --> 36:35.789
Passed.

36:37.167 --> 36:38.167
One!

36:39.069 --> 36:40.161
Two!

36:41.505 --> 36:42.597
Three!

36:44.008 --> 36:45.008
Passed, top marks!

36:52.516 --> 36:58.250
Really, in today's world,
who tests with a sack of rice?

36:58.422 --> 37:00.390
But why do you want to go anyway?

37:00.658 --> 37:02.148
Your family's not poor.

37:04.528 --> 37:05.995
Chasing my dream.

37:06.730 --> 37:08.459
Huh? What dream?

37:09.300 --> 37:10.358
Foreign women.

37:11.635 --> 37:15.002
Physical development that
Asians can't compete with.

37:16.307 --> 37:19.572
The sort of free mind that
Korean women can't imagine...

37:20.811 --> 37:22.711
Can't find that in this country.

37:25.449 --> 37:27.116
- You'll like it too.
- Quiet, you idiot.

37:27.117 --> 37:29.585
Next applicants!

37:31.355 --> 37:33.448
Cheon Dal-gu,
you're a bit weak physically.

37:33.958 --> 37:36.993
Yes, I tend to concentrate on
lower body workouts, so...

37:36.994 --> 37:40.589
Yoon Duk-soo, your written test
and everything look good, but...

37:40.698 --> 37:42.791
no mining experience.

37:42.933 --> 37:47.131
Yes, but I served in the army's
engineer corps. We shoveled a lot!

37:47.204 --> 37:48.296
Ah, engineer corps?

37:48.405 --> 37:51.169
- Yes.
- But that's not quite enough.

37:53.877 --> 37:54.639
Sir!

37:54.745 --> 37:56.440
I must go to west Germany!

37:56.880 --> 38:00.748
Until that day when
the East Sea runs dry

38:00.884 --> 38:04.081
and Mt. Baekdu is worn away,

38:04.221 --> 38:11.252
God protect and
preserve our nation!

38:11.528 --> 38:15.294
3000 li of rivers and mountains,

38:15.399 --> 38:19.392
filled with Roses of Sharon,

38:19.603 --> 38:23.369
great Korean people stay true

38:23.507 --> 38:26.840
to the great Korean way!

38:26.944 --> 38:29.674
Long live the Republic of Korea!

38:29.880 --> 38:31.748
Hurrah! Hurrah!

38:31.749 --> 38:33.614
<i>Passed: Strong patriotism</i>

38:53.203 --> 38:57.105
<i>Spring 1964
Hamborn Coal Mine, Duisburg</i>

39:29.973 --> 39:31.804
Success and safe return.

40:01.738 --> 40:03.831
Hey, you! Hurry up.

40:13.083 --> 40:15.950
Hey, are you okay?

40:16.253 --> 40:17.447
Duk-soo!

40:18.555 --> 40:19.920
What's wrong?

40:21.058 --> 40:24.824
Combine! Stop the combine!

40:31.368 --> 40:32.232
Duk-soo!

40:32.336 --> 40:34.827
You okay? Let me see...

40:35.439 --> 40:36.497
Damn!

40:36.974 --> 40:38.236
Here.

42:24.548 --> 42:30.316
♪ <i>A story from long ago</i> ♪

42:30.887 --> 42:35.347
♪ <i>That refuses to leave my mind</i> ♪

42:41.398 --> 42:42.660
Don't touch me!

42:48.805 --> 42:51.171
Ah, you're a nurse.

42:51.308 --> 42:53.868
They say that's really hard work.

42:54.144 --> 42:56.237
Surely mining must be harder.

42:56.346 --> 42:58.007
Ah, not at all!

42:58.315 --> 43:00.146
It's really not that bad.

43:00.584 --> 43:02.779
Then when did you arrive in Germany?

43:03.320 --> 43:04.480
Germany?

43:05.022 --> 43:07.217
December the year before last...

43:08.692 --> 43:10.091
About two years ago.

43:10.560 --> 43:13.927
Meeting you here, suddenly
I'm craving Korean food.

43:17.301 --> 43:18.666
I didn't look.

43:25.242 --> 43:26.402
What, a woman?

43:27.210 --> 43:28.973
Really, a Korean woman?

43:29.079 --> 43:33.948
She's in the nursing school
at St. Anna's in Duisburg.

43:34.618 --> 43:36.142
Nursing school! Nursing school!

43:36.353 --> 43:39.049
Wow, a white angel! Nightingale!

43:39.956 --> 43:42.220
Is she well developed? Big hips?

43:42.459 --> 43:44.460
A woman should
have a large pelvis.

43:44.461 --> 43:46.952
Stop it, will you?
But are they big?

43:47.064 --> 43:48.326
How big? Huh?

43:48.465 --> 43:50.399
Come on, quiet down!

43:50.667 --> 43:53.727
Anyway, you arranged
to meet her alone, right?

43:54.171 --> 43:55.763
- Of course he did.
- When?

43:55.872 --> 43:58.602
No, I'm not meeting her alone.

44:00.243 --> 44:02.178
- You fool!
- You don't have a clue!

44:02.179 --> 44:03.942
Why'd you even mention it then?

44:04.981 --> 44:06.005
I think he's impotent.

44:06.116 --> 44:07.777
Why is the bread so hard again?

44:09.820 --> 44:13.187
Ah, you soot-covered idiots...

44:24.401 --> 44:25.493
You having fun?

44:25.769 --> 44:27.236
Of course I am!

44:27.838 --> 44:30.840
Miss, where do you hang out?
You're a great dancer!

44:30.841 --> 44:32.001
Leave her alone!

44:48.759 --> 44:49.759
Let go of me!

44:49.926 --> 44:51.093
Who is it?

44:51.094 --> 44:51.895
Who?

44:51.896 --> 44:53.089
Over there!

44:53.330 --> 44:54.330
I dunno.

44:54.364 --> 44:55.854
Ask, then!

44:56.700 --> 44:58.258
Youngja, who is that?

45:01.505 --> 45:03.973
Dormitory inspector.
She came to watch over us.

45:45.682 --> 45:47.343
No, no, no...

45:56.059 --> 45:57.059
Hammering...

45:57.727 --> 45:58.727
and your turn!

46:50.180 --> 46:51.772
Youngja, look!

46:52.115 --> 46:53.173
Mr. Yoon!

46:53.783 --> 46:55.444
Are you crazy? At this hour?

46:55.519 --> 46:56.585
You must be tired, right?

46:56.586 --> 46:58.713
Quiet, you idiot.

47:08.431 --> 47:09.199
What was that?

47:09.200 --> 47:10.257
I dunno!

47:12.969 --> 47:13.803
Wow!

47:13.804 --> 47:15.634
You said you craved Korean food.

47:17.974 --> 47:22.570
Your eyes were glued to my breasts,
but your ears still heard me.

47:22.646 --> 47:25.843
Ah, it wasn't like that, really.

47:26.182 --> 47:27.376
Take this.

47:28.285 --> 47:29.752
I didn't look, really.

47:31.588 --> 47:33.317
But, your friend?

47:34.491 --> 47:38.325
Ah, Dal-gu?
He's meeting someone.

47:38.428 --> 47:39.428
Who?

47:41.965 --> 47:44.366
Ma'am, you mustn't do that.

47:44.367 --> 47:46.232
That's... that's not why I came.

47:46.336 --> 47:47.203
Shut your mouth.

47:47.204 --> 47:48.363
What's she saying?

47:49.940 --> 47:51.965
Is she crazy? What's she doing?

47:53.009 --> 47:54.476
Please spare me, ma'am.

47:54.811 --> 47:56.403
So cute...

48:00.917 --> 48:01.917
Yes, that's it!

48:02.218 --> 48:03.378
The taste I missed.

48:06.656 --> 48:08.190
Youngja, I wanted to ask.

48:08.191 --> 48:09.283
Yes?

48:09.459 --> 48:11.893
That day we first met,

48:12.262 --> 48:14.958
why were you singing
such a sad song?

48:20.370 --> 48:21.428
Just because...

48:22.505 --> 48:24.302
things were hard.

48:25.475 --> 48:29.138
When things are hard,
don't cry all alone.

48:29.245 --> 48:30.872
If you tell me,

48:31.348 --> 48:34.249
I'll cook this kimchi stew
and bring it to you.

48:35.619 --> 48:39.885
So from now on,
if you can't help crying,

48:40.457 --> 48:42.948
please don't ever cry alone.

48:43.126 --> 48:44.126
Why not?

48:45.128 --> 48:47.426
Your heart coarsens,

48:47.697 --> 48:48.925
if you cry alone.

48:50.066 --> 48:52.091
If we cry together,
will that help?

48:52.502 --> 48:53.662
Sure.

48:54.304 --> 48:57.432
They say, "Even a sheet of paper
is lighter if held by two."

48:59.909 --> 49:01.001
Youngja.

49:02.512 --> 49:04.241
Please promise me.

49:05.281 --> 49:11.345
That you won't cry alone anymore.

49:15.992 --> 49:17.892
Thank you, Mr. Yoon.

49:18.361 --> 49:21.524
I said, call me Duk-soo.

49:34.811 --> 49:36.039
Mommy...

50:05.041 --> 50:06.338
Sit comfortably.

50:11.981 --> 50:13.039
Catch me if you can!

50:15.685 --> 50:16.913
Gotcha!

50:22.559 --> 50:23.617
My apologies.

50:30.767 --> 50:31.961
It's okay.

50:40.744 --> 50:42.336
Wow, looks tasty!

50:44.214 --> 50:46.045
- Sorry for the wait.
- It's fine...

50:53.022 --> 50:56.150
But, aren't you curious?

50:56.626 --> 50:57.650
About what?

50:58.027 --> 50:59.858
What kind of person I am...

51:00.163 --> 51:02.154
where I lived in Korea,

51:02.532 --> 51:04.523
well, what my family situation is.

51:04.768 --> 51:06.963
What's the point in asking?

51:07.303 --> 51:08.303
What?

51:08.538 --> 51:09.937
You must have been poor.

51:10.373 --> 51:12.034
Probably an eldest daughter.

51:12.375 --> 51:16.641
And your siblings all had their
mouths open like baby birds.

51:17.447 --> 51:23.010
So you send all your
hard-earned money back home.

51:26.489 --> 51:27.683
We're here.

51:27.791 --> 51:29.622
Already?

51:30.560 --> 51:31.925
Here.

51:33.296 --> 51:34.490
It was fun.

51:43.006 --> 51:44.439
Good night.

52:14.070 --> 52:16.470
I held her hand!

52:25.815 --> 52:28.477
No, this can't be! Methane gas!

52:28.585 --> 52:31.110
The pressure is over 3%!

52:31.254 --> 52:33.518
Everyone must evacuate!
All the miners below.

52:34.991 --> 52:37.289
Everyone evacuate!

52:37.427 --> 52:39.258
Quickly!

52:40.730 --> 52:44.723
<i>Everyone evacuate!
Gas is leaking! Quickly!</i>

53:05.521 --> 53:07.386
- What is it, Duk-soo?
- What was that?

53:10.994 --> 53:13.462
The tunnel's collapsing!

53:13.563 --> 53:14.763
The tunnel's collapsing!

53:14.764 --> 53:15.831
- What?
- The tunnel's collapsing!

53:15.832 --> 53:16.832
Duk-soo, come on!

53:16.866 --> 53:17.890
Quick!

53:31.447 --> 53:33.711
Dal-gu! Dal-gu!

53:36.586 --> 53:37.653
Come on, get up!

53:37.654 --> 53:39.986
- Duk-soo, come on!
- Duk-soo!

53:40.156 --> 53:41.890
- Hey!
- Let go of me!

53:41.891 --> 53:45.292
Let go! Dal-gu! Dal-gu!

53:45.561 --> 53:47.961
- Duk-soo!
- We need to go!

53:50.033 --> 53:52.001
Oh, that hurts!

53:52.135 --> 53:53.568
Wait, wait!

53:54.404 --> 53:55.871
Don't leave me here.

53:55.872 --> 53:57.706
Even if I die,
my ghost will come after you.

53:57.707 --> 53:58.833
Shut up!

53:58.942 --> 54:00.273
Shut up!

54:12.789 --> 54:13.789
Duk-soo!

54:18.962 --> 54:20.020
Duk-soo!

54:29.505 --> 54:30.597
Father...

54:35.878 --> 54:39.678
Youngja!
There was a mine explosion.

54:40.683 --> 54:42.310
Explosion? Where?

54:42.452 --> 54:43.817
In Hamborn.

54:55.465 --> 54:56.465
Duk-soo.

55:22.492 --> 55:23.992
Out of the way!
Our friends are dying!

55:23.993 --> 55:25.794
Stay back! It's too dangerous!

55:25.795 --> 55:27.429
The shaft is still full of gas.

55:27.430 --> 55:29.193
Just be thankful
you're still alive.

55:33.469 --> 55:34.469
What happened?

55:34.470 --> 55:37.200
Duk-soo and Dal-gu
are trapped inside.

55:37.740 --> 55:39.074
We're trying to go down,

55:39.075 --> 55:41.066
- but they keep stopping us...
- No!

55:46.449 --> 55:47.746
Why can't we go down?

55:47.850 --> 55:50.580
It's too dangerous.
There could be an explosion.

55:50.653 --> 55:52.086
And the people down there?

55:52.155 --> 55:56.182
We can't do anything
until the gas dissipates.

55:56.426 --> 55:59.361
But, then they'll die!

55:59.829 --> 56:01.456
The people down there!

56:01.631 --> 56:04.191
Those people
risked their lives for you!

56:04.934 --> 56:08.802
Those people... those poor,

56:09.205 --> 56:11.373
luckless Koreans,

56:11.374 --> 56:16.277
who came to this distant land
just to earn money.

56:16.946 --> 56:19.281
If you won't go down,
then we will.

56:19.282 --> 56:22.877
Don't be absurd.
Who knows if they're even alive?

56:26.489 --> 56:27.547
Watch your mouth!

56:28.191 --> 56:30.523
Those people won't die!

56:31.727 --> 56:33.786
If they die, it's in front of us!

56:47.176 --> 56:48.176
Please!

56:48.511 --> 56:50.240
Let us go in!

56:50.513 --> 56:55.075
Even if they're dead,
we should find their bodies.

56:55.184 --> 56:56.208
Please!

56:56.919 --> 56:59.149
Say yes, please.

56:59.655 --> 57:00.655
No!

57:06.896 --> 57:08.261
- Hey.
- Yeah?

57:11.067 --> 57:12.067
Let's go.

57:12.735 --> 57:15.431
- Hey, let's go!
- Let's go!

57:16.239 --> 57:17.263
Get up.

57:20.843 --> 57:23.038
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

57:31.587 --> 57:33.384
Duk-soo.

57:46.135 --> 57:47.135
Duk-soo!

57:48.104 --> 57:49.162
Duk-soo.

57:51.274 --> 57:52.274
Duk-soo!

57:52.475 --> 57:53.669
Duk-soo, where are you?!

57:53.776 --> 57:56.836
Duk-soo, answer me!

57:57.747 --> 57:58.747
Duk-soo!

58:04.720 --> 58:05.744
Duk-soo!

58:08.257 --> 58:09.377
Duk-soo, get out from there!

58:11.327 --> 58:12.988
Get out, quick!

58:13.296 --> 58:15.821
Duk-soo! Duk-soo!

58:18.501 --> 58:19.501
Duk-soo.

58:19.535 --> 58:23.096
I'm scared, Duk-soo!
Open your eyes!

58:27.109 --> 58:31.443
If you die here, then
what about your family?

58:32.381 --> 58:35.350
Get up, you damned Beggar Boy!

58:39.355 --> 58:40.355
Duk-soo!

58:41.691 --> 58:42.749
You're alive!

58:43.993 --> 58:45.551
You're alive, Duk-soo!

58:54.604 --> 58:57.004
How much time has passed?

59:01.911 --> 59:03.037
Duk-soo...

59:03.613 --> 59:04.944
You're thirsty, right?

59:09.285 --> 59:10.946
We need to save the battery.

59:23.266 --> 59:24.324
Duk-soo...

59:25.401 --> 59:26.595
Duk-soo...

59:29.071 --> 59:30.197
Duk-soo...

59:38.114 --> 59:39.308
Duk-soo...

59:46.522 --> 59:47.750
Dad...

59:51.460 --> 59:55.419
I'm looking after them well,
at Kkotbun's Shop.

59:59.535 --> 01:00:03.562
Mom is still doing okay, for now.

01:00:04.774 --> 01:00:06.503
I miss her...

01:00:08.744 --> 01:00:13.044
Seung-gyu is
an unbelievable student.

01:00:15.017 --> 01:00:17.815
He just got into Seoul National.

01:00:19.488 --> 01:00:22.514
Kkeutsun keeps getting prettier.

01:00:23.626 --> 01:00:26.186
She causes trouble sometimes,

01:00:26.929 --> 01:00:29.489
but she's turning
into a fine woman.

01:00:33.736 --> 01:00:37.866
Maksoon... my sister Maksoon...

01:00:39.108 --> 01:00:41.167
I haven't found her yet.

01:00:42.278 --> 01:00:45.406
I'm so sorry to her.

01:00:48.184 --> 01:00:49.412
Dad,

01:00:50.853 --> 01:00:52.480
life is hard...

01:00:54.056 --> 01:00:58.117
It's really hard for me.

01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:06.591
But the one I really
want to see right now,

01:01:07.837 --> 01:01:10.169
isn't you, or Mom,

01:01:10.272 --> 01:01:12.604
or Seung-gyu, or Kkeutsun...

01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:15.575
it's Youngja.

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:20.174
- Duk-soo! Duk-soo!
- Dal-gu!

01:01:20.316 --> 01:01:23.485
- Dal-gu, are you okay?
- Hey, bring a stretcher!

01:01:23.486 --> 01:01:25.511
- Dal-gu!
- Quick, a stretcher!

01:01:25.955 --> 01:01:30.258
Take Duk-soo first,
he's hurt bad.

01:01:30.259 --> 01:01:32.494
Wait just a minute!
We'll pull you out.

01:01:32.495 --> 01:01:34.588
Duk-soo's not waking up.

01:01:35.097 --> 01:01:38.294
Hey, a stretcher, quick!
Hurry up and bring it!

01:01:42.338 --> 01:01:43.828
Damned rain.

01:01:44.707 --> 01:01:46.334
<i>They're coming out!</i>

01:01:46.409 --> 01:01:47.467
What?

01:01:58.988 --> 01:02:01.889
Out of the way!

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.365
I'm relieved to see you
recover so quickly.

01:03:27.977 --> 01:03:29.808
All thanks to you.

01:03:30.479 --> 01:03:32.447
I don't know how to thank you.

01:03:33.282 --> 01:03:36.851
Cook me something tasty.
This time, bean paste stew?

01:03:36.852 --> 01:03:38.479
Shall I?

01:03:39.255 --> 01:03:40.722
What are you doing next weekend?

01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:42.955
This week I'm a bit busy.

01:03:43.692 --> 01:03:46.024
Can we make it this weekend?

01:03:46.595 --> 01:03:47.595
Why?

01:03:50.032 --> 01:03:51.897
To be honest...

01:03:54.003 --> 01:03:57.097
my visa expires in a week.

01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:01.507
And they're not extending
miners' visas anymore.

01:04:03.279 --> 01:04:06.715
Good for you.
You've been wanting to go back.

01:04:07.583 --> 01:04:08.743
Youngja.

01:04:11.053 --> 01:04:16.116
How about coming back
with me to Korea?

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:18.993
Money's nice,

01:04:18.994 --> 01:04:24.057
but rather than washing corpses
all day long in a foreign country...

01:04:24.166 --> 01:04:26.566
There you go.

01:04:35.144 --> 01:04:36.372
Youngja.

01:04:38.047 --> 01:04:39.571
Don't cry.

01:04:41.951 --> 01:04:43.885
Why cry on such a beautiful day?

01:04:45.487 --> 01:04:50.083
You'll return home proudly,
having earned a lot of money.

01:04:51.126 --> 01:04:54.584
And I'm working hard
and living well here.

01:04:57.866 --> 01:04:58.866
Duk-soo.

01:05:00.436 --> 01:05:02.199
Congratulations on your return.

01:06:00.696 --> 01:06:01.754
Mom!

01:06:02.798 --> 01:06:04.095
Mom!

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.229
- Seung-kyu, Kkeutsun!
- Duk-soo!

01:06:06.669 --> 01:06:08.336
This is our new home?

01:06:08.337 --> 01:06:10.304
- Wow, it's great!
- Duk-soo!

01:06:10.305 --> 01:06:11.040
Duk-soo!

01:06:11.041 --> 01:06:12.439
Come here!

01:06:16.545 --> 01:06:19.113
Is our Seoul University kid
studying well?

01:06:19.114 --> 01:06:20.114
Sure, brother.

01:06:20.115 --> 01:06:22.617
- Mom!
- Duk-soo!

01:06:22.618 --> 01:06:24.419
You worked so hard over there...

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:26.513
No big deal.
You've worked hard too.

01:06:26.655 --> 01:06:28.823
Auntie, is the store doing well?

01:06:28.824 --> 01:06:30.958
Sure, sure. Too well, in fact!

01:06:30.959 --> 01:06:32.893
Duk-soo, did you earn a lot?

01:06:33.095 --> 01:06:34.221
Sure!

01:06:34.329 --> 01:06:36.264
Hey, don't touch a lady's butt!

01:06:36.265 --> 01:06:39.067
Lady? How's our lady
doing at school?

01:06:39.068 --> 01:06:40.868
<i>Pretty</i> girls don't need to study.

01:06:40.869 --> 01:06:43.037
Then you better study hard!

01:06:43.038 --> 01:06:44.630
What!?

01:06:44.773 --> 01:06:50.336
Mom, let me carry you!
Let's take a spin!

01:06:57.286 --> 01:06:58.446
Auntie come here, your turn.

01:06:59.655 --> 01:07:00.822
Are you healthy enough?

01:07:00.823 --> 01:07:03.451
Ah, then not Auntie, Mom again!

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:06.728
Duk-soo, me too!

01:07:06.729 --> 01:07:09.030
<i>December 21, 1966
First group of miners return from Germany</i>

01:07:09.031 --> 01:07:10.658
This is our home!

01:07:11.166 --> 01:07:13.464
Auntie, I brought the stuff
you ordered.

01:07:14.002 --> 01:07:15.663
You're always on top of things.

01:07:16.004 --> 01:07:19.565
Now that you own a house,
you should take over this store.

01:07:19.808 --> 01:07:20.808
What?

01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:24.511
No Auntie, you're still
healthy and strong.

01:07:24.813 --> 01:07:29.443
No, if I die,
I want you to have this store.

01:07:30.719 --> 01:07:31.743
Auntie...

01:07:32.054 --> 01:07:34.022
Here it is. Hey, Beggar Boy!

01:07:34.123 --> 01:07:34.714
What?

01:07:35.023 --> 01:07:37.150
- Oh, your aunt's here.
- Hello.

01:07:37.259 --> 01:07:39.727
This gentleman
is looking for some cloth.

01:07:39.728 --> 01:07:41.889
Oh, really?
Over here, take a look.

01:07:43.398 --> 01:07:49.234
I'm seeking an exotic
and abnormal kind of fabric.

01:07:50.439 --> 01:07:52.100
Fabric... fabric...

01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:55.538
Oh, not this.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.108
This is good... abnormal.

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:08.286
Oh, fantastic! Unbelievable!

01:08:08.557 --> 01:08:12.687
I was seeking a fabric
for women of elegance.

01:08:12.828 --> 01:08:15.456
But that fabric was
nowhere to be found.

01:08:15.898 --> 01:08:20.232
Why didn't I think of putting
embroidery in fabric?

01:08:20.368 --> 01:08:25.500
Oh, idiot! Oh, stupid! Oh, fool!

01:08:25.674 --> 01:08:29.701
Ah, then in Seoul,
men make women's clothing?

01:08:29.877 --> 01:08:35.042
In our generation, the shattering
of gender roles will be a hot topic.

01:08:35.350 --> 01:08:38.683
I appreciate your help.
Thank you!

01:08:39.121 --> 01:08:41.112
See you later!

01:08:43.457 --> 01:08:44.457
His bag.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:47.991
Mr. Kim! Kim Bong-nam!

01:08:49.531 --> 01:08:51.260
Shattering of gender roles?

01:08:51.733 --> 01:08:54.435
He probably thinks a man
can have a baby.

01:08:54.435 --> 01:08:57.928
Ha, don't be ridiculous!

01:09:03.212 --> 01:09:04.304
Youngja...

01:09:05.814 --> 01:09:08.544
How long has it been, Youngja?

01:09:08.951 --> 01:09:09.951
3 months.

01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:14.087
Is that all?
It feels like 3 years.

01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:16.290
Anyway, let's have a drink.

01:09:16.291 --> 01:09:17.291
No.

01:09:18.193 --> 01:09:19.854
Why not? You don't drink?

01:09:20.028 --> 01:09:22.087
I'm not allowed to drink.

01:09:25.033 --> 01:09:26.432
I'm pregnant.

01:09:29.337 --> 01:09:30.395
Pregnant?

01:09:31.173 --> 01:09:35.109
Ah... oh my, congrats.
Congratulations.

01:09:35.577 --> 01:09:37.772
That's such great news.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:42.475
Will he be named "Schu..." like other
German boys? Schu-shine?

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:45.620
He'll be Yoon!

01:09:45.654 --> 01:09:48.214
The day before
you left for Korea!

01:09:48.323 --> 01:09:50.154
Won't you reconsider?

01:09:51.827 --> 01:09:54.625
If you come back to Korea
with me now...

01:09:54.730 --> 01:09:57.028
I'll support you, and...

01:10:01.837 --> 01:10:02.870
I'm sorry.

01:10:02.871 --> 01:10:04.668
Shouldn't have brought it up.

01:10:10.078 --> 01:10:13.809

only chance to sing this.

01:13:19.968 --> 01:13:21.128
Great?

01:13:21.570 --> 01:13:23.128
Nam Jin sings much better.

01:13:23.705 --> 01:13:27.402
Hey, don't you have
any songs by Nam Jin?

01:13:27.476 --> 01:13:29.000
What?

01:13:29.177 --> 01:13:31.679
What's important,
the face or the voice?

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:33.773
Na Hoon-a is much cooler.

01:13:34.015 --> 01:13:37.246
Get out, the really
cool one is Nam Jin.

01:13:37.752 --> 01:13:40.118
Ask any of these people.

01:13:40.956 --> 01:13:43.686
Who's better,
Nam Jin or Na Hoon-a?

01:13:43.792 --> 01:13:46.818
No question,
Na Hoon-a's the better singer.

01:13:47.129 --> 01:13:49.630
Nam Jin looks like a girl.

01:13:49.631 --> 01:13:50.791
Right!

01:13:51.166 --> 01:13:55.068
Just chop your fish heads
and mind your damn business!

01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:56.797
Nam Jin's the best!

01:13:58.874 --> 01:14:00.739
Don't ask me to
walk with you anymore!

01:14:09.117 --> 01:14:11.847
Coming through!

01:14:13.054 --> 01:14:16.080
<i>Autumn 1973</i>

01:14:16.825 --> 01:14:18.816
Those kids have a good appetite.

01:14:20.061 --> 01:14:23.656
- Kid, what grade are you in?
- Fifth grade.

01:14:23.765 --> 01:14:25.665
Fifth grade? You do sports?

01:14:25.767 --> 01:14:26.568
Yes.

01:14:26.568 --> 01:14:27.432
Which sport?

01:14:27.536 --> 01:14:28.836
Wrestling.

01:14:28.837 --> 01:14:30.137
- Wrestling?
- Yes.

01:14:30.138 --> 01:14:32.373
Just stuffing your face
won't help you in wrestling.

01:14:32.374 --> 01:14:34.365
You need technique, you know?

01:14:34.476 --> 01:14:37.309
- Holds and flips...
- Dammit, let's go!

01:14:37.979 --> 01:14:40.447
Rude little punk, interrupting
your elder like that!

01:14:40.448 --> 01:14:41.515
Hey!

01:14:41.516 --> 01:14:42.642
Dal-gu!

01:14:43.084 --> 01:14:45.450
Dal-gu, I passed!

01:14:45.854 --> 01:14:48.049
Korea Maritime University!

01:14:48.523 --> 01:14:50.224
- Really?
- You bet.

01:14:50.225 --> 01:14:50.859
<i>Lee Man-gi</i>

01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:53.293
Soon I'll be a captain!

01:14:53.595 --> 01:14:55.620
And I thought you were
just a blockhead!

01:14:55.764 --> 01:14:56.958
Duk-soo!

01:14:57.432 --> 01:14:58.899
Dal-gu!

01:14:59.901 --> 01:15:02.301
Dal-gu! Hey, don't do that!

01:15:04.206 --> 01:15:05.298
That's a great dress.

01:15:07.075 --> 01:15:09.100
- I gave you a big piece.
- Thanks.

01:15:09.444 --> 01:15:12.845
You never buy meat, what's up?

01:15:13.248 --> 01:15:14.715
Receive some good news?

01:15:14.816 --> 01:15:16.374
- Can you tell?
- Yeah.

01:15:17.085 --> 01:15:19.386
- Have a good day.
- Bye.

01:15:19.387 --> 01:15:20.387
Bye.

01:15:20.956 --> 01:15:22.685
You can sell the house!

01:15:23.258 --> 01:15:25.852
How can you even say that?

01:15:26.161 --> 01:15:28.595
And why should it cost you
so much to marry?

01:15:28.697 --> 01:15:31.832
You keep repeating that, and
I'm turning into an old maid!

01:15:31.833 --> 01:15:36.065
How dare you shout at your
mother like that!

01:15:36.438 --> 01:15:40.238
Your brother emptied his pockets
to buy this house!

01:15:40.442 --> 01:15:43.210
You know our situation,
how can you carry on like that?

01:15:43.211 --> 01:15:46.339
You did it for my younger brother
when he got married!

01:15:46.648 --> 01:15:49.116
Didn't you even think of
your daughter's wedding?

01:15:49.117 --> 01:15:53.454
Your older brother spent
barely a coin on his wedding!

01:15:53.455 --> 01:15:55.787
The idiot wanted it that way!

01:15:55.890 --> 01:15:57.357
Hey!

01:15:57.892 --> 01:16:00.122
You little ingrate!

01:16:00.862 --> 01:16:03.763
Don't you know who
sent you to university?

01:16:04.332 --> 01:16:09.998
Your brother almost killed himself
mining coal in west Germany,

01:16:10.305 --> 01:16:12.296
so that you two could study,

01:16:12.407 --> 01:16:15.843
and we could buy this house!

01:16:18.413 --> 01:16:22.782
When is she
ever going to grow up?

01:16:27.055 --> 01:16:29.580
Look at the view here!
This is it.

01:16:30.892 --> 01:16:33.588
It's originally an
imported goods store.

01:16:33.928 --> 01:16:36.260
But you could turn it
into whatever you want.

01:16:36.531 --> 01:16:39.398
Hey! What's going on here?

01:16:40.535 --> 01:16:43.037
Uncle!
We just laid my aunt to rest.

01:16:43.038 --> 01:16:45.673
She worked her whole life
maintaining that store!

01:16:45.674 --> 01:16:47.608
How can you sell it
without consulting us?

01:16:49.311 --> 01:16:52.613
I'm selling my store,
who do I have to consult?

01:16:52.614 --> 01:16:54.707
It's not your store,
it's Auntie's!

01:16:54.849 --> 01:16:57.545
Who are you to yell at me!

01:17:02.657 --> 01:17:05.125
I don't have any money to live.

01:17:05.894 --> 01:17:08.954
If I don't sell that store,
I'll starve.

01:17:10.332 --> 01:17:12.630
What, cat got your tongue?

01:17:13.702 --> 01:17:15.101
Leave, then!

01:17:20.408 --> 01:17:21.602
I'll buy it!

01:17:22.744 --> 01:17:23.678
What?

01:17:23.679 --> 01:17:25.009
Kkotbun's Shop!

01:17:25.714 --> 01:17:27.579
I can buy it out
from you, can't I?

01:17:36.691 --> 01:17:39.956
<i>Kkotbun's Shop</i>

01:17:51.973 --> 01:17:53.668
<i>Certificate of Acceptance</i>

01:18:12.127 --> 01:18:13.219
No way.

01:18:13.595 --> 01:18:15.119
Vietnam's at war.

01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:17.531
I may not know much,

01:18:17.532 --> 01:18:21.832
but I won't send you to a place
where so many men are dying!

01:18:22.103 --> 01:18:25.971
Mom, those are
soldiers carrying guns.

01:18:26.107 --> 01:18:29.634
For technicians like us,
it's completely safe.

01:18:29.778 --> 01:18:31.268
I doubt that.

01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:34.244
Duk-soo, do they pay you well?

01:18:34.516 --> 01:18:35.676
Shut your mouth.

01:18:36.551 --> 01:18:39.987
They pay in dollars, $850.

01:18:40.121 --> 01:18:41.588
That's 400,000 won.

01:18:42.090 --> 01:18:44.925
Wow, then my wedding
will be no problem!

01:18:44.926 --> 01:18:48.760
I said, shut your mouth!
Anyway, there's no way!

01:18:50.165 --> 01:18:53.999
If we're frugal,
we can save for her wedding.

01:18:55.203 --> 01:18:57.838
Mom, just let me go.

01:18:57.839 --> 01:18:59.306
It's not like I'm going alone.

01:18:59.307 --> 01:19:00.604
Who else is going?

01:19:00.742 --> 01:19:02.539
Dal-gu said he's going too.

01:19:03.878 --> 01:19:05.243
I... I did?

01:19:06.681 --> 01:19:07.875
When?

01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:09.149
No.

01:19:09.617 --> 01:19:11.016
She's right.

01:19:11.186 --> 01:19:12.744
You want to make me a widow?

01:19:12.854 --> 01:19:14.549
Then we'd be widow village here!

01:19:16.090 --> 01:19:20.049
Whether you live or die,
you're staying here.

01:19:20.395 --> 01:19:22.329
Why are you so negative?

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.126
Anyway, forget it.

01:19:31.706 --> 01:19:34.106
Honey, I'm the eldest son.

01:19:34.242 --> 01:19:35.539
And the head of the household!

01:19:35.610 --> 01:19:36.668
That's right.

01:19:36.945 --> 01:19:40.779
Either way, I have to
look after my family.

01:19:40.915 --> 01:19:42.746
You've done enough!

01:19:43.418 --> 01:19:45.010
Why do more?

01:19:45.987 --> 01:19:48.922
Why is it always you
who sacrifices himself?

01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:50.316
That's enough, stop.

01:19:50.658 --> 01:19:54.651
And you think I don't know?
The wedding?

01:19:55.230 --> 01:19:58.199
No, you're going to a war zone
because of that store!

01:19:58.299 --> 01:19:59.493
You think I'm stupid?

01:19:59.601 --> 01:20:01.034
Stop it, please!

01:20:01.569 --> 01:20:03.332
Why do you talk back so much?

01:20:06.374 --> 01:20:08.865
You think I want to go there?
Huh?

01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:10.410
It's my damned fate!

01:20:10.411 --> 01:20:12.402
Why are you blaming me
for my fate?

01:20:16.184 --> 01:20:17.845
What about your fate?

01:20:20.822 --> 01:20:25.316
It's time for you to live
for yourself, not others.

01:20:26.761 --> 01:20:27.955
It's your life,

01:20:28.062 --> 01:20:30.155
why is there
no part of you in it?

01:20:34.002 --> 01:20:37.460
<i>I, standing before

01:20:37.906 --> 01:20:42.343

Hey, you brought me to Germany!

A coal mine and a war zone
are not the same!

01:21:21.849 --> 01:21:23.111
What's the difference?

01:21:23.251 --> 01:21:24.718
It's a job either way.

01:21:24.819 --> 01:21:27.421
There's more to life than money.

01:21:27.422 --> 01:21:29.549
There's more to life than women.

01:21:30.391 --> 01:21:32.256
And where'd you get

01:21:32.327 --> 01:21:34.659
Oh, it's hot.

01:21:50.479 --> 01:21:53.140
Uh, sign okay.
Okay, okay. Sign, sign.

01:21:58.252 --> 01:22:00.345
Oh, it's hot.

Dal-gu, look.

01:22:05.827 --> 01:22:07.294
Seen that before, huh?

01:22:08.296 --> 01:22:09.296
Forget that.

01:22:09.731 --> 01:22:12.393

01:22:12.734 --> 01:22:13.894
- Where?
- There.

Are you an idiot?
That's for US soldiers.

01:22:18.172 --> 01:22:19.298
We can't go in there.

01:22:24.212 --> 01:22:25.406
Oh, ladies!

Oh my. Don't cry.

<i>Youngja, I've been thinking.</i>

01:25:55.389 --> 01:25:57.380
<i>Isn't it a relief to know</i>

01:25:58.092 --> 01:26:00.083
<i>That is was us,

<i>Still, I'm thankful that

Dal-gu! Don't kill us!

01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:18.387
It's all right,
we're the Marines.

01:29:19.727 --> 01:29:21.428
What the hell are you doing here?

01:29:21.429 --> 01:29:22.896
- Don't kill us!
- Mister, we're the Marines.

01:29:22.897 --> 01:29:25.999
This area's been occupied
by the Viet Cong.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.403
The Americans all evacuated.
Follow us.

01:29:31.872 --> 01:29:33.339
There are snakes here, snakes!

01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:35.508
What are you doing,
we're in a hurry!

01:29:35.509 --> 01:29:36.908
Driving me crazy...

01:29:36.977 --> 01:29:40.208
By any chance, are you Nam Jin?

01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:45.644
Ah, my popularity
spreads to all corners...

01:29:45.986 --> 01:29:47.010
Duk-soo!

01:29:47.121 --> 01:29:48.986
Dal-gu, we're saved!

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:56.758
On that grassy plain,
I'll build a <i>pretty</i> house

01:29:56.997 --> 01:29:58.430
with the one I love...

01:29:58.532 --> 01:30:00.796
we built this pier here.

01:30:00.935 --> 01:30:04.371
Don't want the enemy
to use it, so we'll detonate it.

01:30:04.705 --> 01:30:07.003
Blow it to smithereens.

01:30:07.374 --> 01:30:08.374
It figures...

01:30:08.843 --> 01:30:11.539
Don't have much time,
so hurry onto the boat.

01:30:11.812 --> 01:30:13.609
Don't want to get blown up.

01:30:15.449 --> 01:30:17.117
'I'll build a pretty house'.

01:30:17.118 --> 01:30:19.279
That song is great.

01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:20.751

01:30:20.855 --> 01:30:21.855
Yeah.

01:30:21.889 --> 01:30:25.347
I'll release it when I go back.
Think it'll be a hit?

01:30:25.626 --> 01:30:26.786
It's got something special.

01:30:28.729 --> 01:30:29.729

01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:32.828

01:30:34.268 --> 01:30:35.428
Three of them.

- Duk-soo, look.

01:31:02.830 --> 01:31:04.798
Hey, what's going on?

01:31:05.799 --> 01:31:07.664
They want us to
take them on the boat.

01:31:08.869 --> 01:31:09.869
No.

01:31:21.182 --> 01:31:23.912
The Americans demanded
info about the Viet Cong.

01:31:24.018 --> 01:31:27.545
Then the Viet Cong arrived,
and asked about the Americans,

01:31:27.655 --> 01:31:30.351
Then they took away
all the young men.

01:31:30.724 --> 01:31:32.783
All war is like that.
It was the same for us.

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:34.252
Hurry, let's go.

01:31:34.562 --> 01:31:37.497

compare the two?

01:31:38.599 --> 01:31:40.499
Is that how I taught you?

01:31:40.801 --> 01:31:41.801
You...

01:31:49.543 --> 01:31:53.377
The Viet Cong will kill us
for talking to you.

01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:03.715
They say if you can't take them,
at least take the children.

01:32:09.763 --> 01:32:12.323
We can't.
There's barely room for us.

01:32:22.343 --> 01:32:23.876
Hey, why aren't you helping?

01:32:23.877 --> 01:32:26.437

Is your timing that bad?

01:38:15.829 --> 01:38:19.925

about that damn store?

should've sold it earlier.

01:39:08.815 --> 01:39:11.181

01:46:14.841 --> 01:46:16.001
How do you do?

01:46:16.176 --> 01:46:18.235
Okay, we're going live.

01:46:18.311 --> 01:46:21.613
When you see the man
on the screen, speak to him.

01:46:21.614 --> 01:46:22.315
All right.

01:46:22.316 --> 01:46:23.582
Just relax.

01:46:23.583 --> 01:46:24.583
All right.

01:46:25.051 --> 01:46:28.077
Okay, here we go.
One, two... cue!

01:46:28.221 --> 01:46:32.351
<i>This is Yoon Duk-soo,
searching for his father and sister.</i>

01:46:32.459 --> 01:46:36.691
A <i>man from Busan saw your
broadcast and contacted us.</i>

01:46:37.063 --> 01:46:40.294
<i>Okay, Mr. Yoon.
We're connecting now.</i>

01:46:51.010 --> 01:46:52.204
<i>Are you Duk-soo?</i>

01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:56.376
<i>Yes... do you know me?</i>

01:46:57.083 --> 01:46:59.244
<i>Are you Yoo Duk-soo,
who lived in Hungnam?</i>

01:47:00.053 --> 01:47:02.647
<i>Yes, I did live in Hungnam,</i>

01:47:03.389 --> 01:47:06.256
<i>but my family name
is Yoon, not</i> Yoo.

01:47:08.561 --> 01:47:11.553
<i>Try to remember...
your name's not Yoo?</i>

01:47:11.831 --> 01:47:17.565
<i>- No, it's Yoon, not</i> Yoo.
- That's not your father.

01:47:18.805 --> 01:47:21.239
<i>Is there a burn mark
on your left arm?</i>

01:47:23.376 --> 01:47:25.344
No, there's no mark.

01:47:30.850 --> 01:47:32.181
<i>I don't think it's him.</i>

01:47:32.852 --> 01:47:34.376
It's not my father.

01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:44.257
Unfortunately, this time
we do not have a reunion.

01:47:44.597 --> 01:47:45.689
It's okay.

01:47:46.099 --> 01:47:48.761
At least there's
still some hope, right?

01:47:49.202 --> 01:47:52.365
Imagine if someone came on
and said he passed away?

01:47:52.839 --> 01:47:55.407
You spent all this money
to come up here to Seoul...

01:47:55.408 --> 01:47:56.602
Please shut up.

01:47:56.876 --> 01:47:57.876
Okay.

01:48:25.371 --> 01:48:26.463
Hello?

01:48:28.174 --> 01:48:30.335
Oh, Duk-soo. Are you okay?

01:48:31.544 --> 01:48:33.136
Don't worry about that.

01:48:34.948 --> 01:48:35.948
What?

01:48:37.584 --> 01:48:38.584
Mom!

01:48:39.686 --> 01:48:40.686
Mom!

01:48:41.921 --> 01:48:44.287
Hey, get camera #3 ready!

01:48:48.494 --> 01:48:49.859
Out of the way!

01:48:50.863 --> 01:48:52.194
Okay, standby!

01:48:53.066 --> 01:48:55.330
One, two, three... cue!

01:48:56.936 --> 01:48:59.097
<i>We have a new piece of news.</i>

01:48:59.205 --> 01:49:02.641
<i>We were just contacted by a woman
who may be Yoon Duk-soo's sister.</i>

01:49:02.642 --> 01:49:04.872
Let's connect to
Los Angeles, in the US.

01:49:05.878 --> 01:49:06.846
The US?

01:49:06.847 --> 01:49:08.814
Yes, she was at Hungnam,

01:49:08.815 --> 01:49:11.316
but you'll have to confirm
the rest with her.

01:49:11.317 --> 01:49:14.946
Now, when she
appears onscreen, talk to her.

01:49:23.029 --> 01:49:29.628
<i>The... name of my sister is Maksoon.
Yoon Maksoon.</i>

01:49:33.273 --> 01:49:35.002
<i>I don't know my real name.</i>

01:49:35.308 --> 01:49:39.210
<i>I was adopted by a family in the United
States when I was just a little girl.</i>

01:49:39.512 --> 01:49:40.512
What's that?

01:49:40.613 --> 01:49:42.638
Oh my, she can't speak Korean.

01:49:43.483 --> 01:49:44.745
What'd she say?

01:49:45.918 --> 01:49:47.579
What did she just say?

01:49:48.821 --> 01:49:50.989
She was adopted
to the US as a girl,

01:49:50.990 --> 01:49:53.356
but she doesn't know
her Korean name.

01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:56.556
Adopted? To the US?

01:50:00.933 --> 01:50:03.731
<i>I... I only have one clear memory.</i>

01:50:04.637 --> 01:50:06.798
<i>It was Heungnam Port in the winter.</i>

01:50:08.074 --> 01:50:09.336
<i>My big brother...</i>

01:50:10.877 --> 01:50:14.005
<i>my brother was carrying me
on his back and running.</i>

01:50:15.048 --> 01:50:16.709
<i>I remember, he was scolding me...</i>

01:50:21.754 --> 01:50:25.957
But then... where
is your hometown?

01:50:25.958 --> 01:50:29.291
Where? Please
ask her where it is.

01:50:30.563 --> 01:50:31.757
<i>I don't know exactly.</i>

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:38.596
I was crying at Heungnam Port when
a U.S. Soldier took me on board.

01:50:39.372 --> 01:50:42.808
I was sent to an orphanage in Busan,
and from there

01:50:42.809 --> 01:50:44.834
I was adopted
by a family in the States.

01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:53.009
I... oh, right. Maksoon...

01:50:53.119 --> 01:50:56.816
had a mole behind her left ear.

01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:09.259
It's really there.

01:51:09.535 --> 01:51:10.968
She has it.

01:51:16.843 --> 01:51:18.572
<i>I remember...</i>

01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:26.714
<i>I remember right before
we were separated...</i>

01:51:28.321 --> 01:51:29.447
<i>my brother told me...</i>

01:51:33.559 --> 01:51:39.930
<i>"This is no playground.
We're not going for fun."</i>

01:51:43.269 --> 01:51:49.833
<i>"Grab my hand tight!"</i>

01:51:50.476 --> 01:51:51.476
I can't believe it.

01:51:52.245 --> 01:51:56.614
My sister Maksoon...

01:52:02.722 --> 01:52:04.155
<i>Am I your sister?</i>

01:52:04.490 --> 01:52:06.082
Look at the clothes!

01:52:06.726 --> 01:52:09.251
That's right!
That was Maksoon's!

01:52:13.065 --> 01:52:15.033
Maksoon!

01:52:17.236 --> 01:52:19.227
<i>I missed you so much!</i>

01:52:19.605 --> 01:52:25.874
Maksoon, I'm sorry!

01:52:26.312 --> 01:52:28.280
<i>Why did you leave me?</i>

01:52:28.915 --> 01:52:30.482
<i>Why did you leave me?</i>

01:52:30.483 --> 01:52:32.075
I... I...

01:52:32.185 --> 01:52:34.619
I couldn't hold on...

01:52:34.854 --> 01:52:40.190
I'm sorry I couldn't hold
your hand tight enough!

01:52:40.793 --> 01:52:44.695
It's really Maksoon.

01:52:44.997 --> 01:52:49.468
Sister, you're alive!

01:52:49.469 --> 01:52:52.495
<i>Where is mom, where is my mother?</i>

01:52:53.906 --> 01:52:58.866
<i>Mom is still alive, Maksoon!
She's still alive!</i>

01:52:59.078 --> 01:53:03.378
Your mom's here...

01:53:03.983 --> 01:53:06.383
<i>I miss my mommy...</i>

01:53:12.124 --> 01:53:14.524
Thank you. Thank you.

01:53:19.632 --> 01:53:21.031
Hurrah!

01:53:25.104 --> 01:53:27.732
Thank you. Thank you.

01:54:02.742 --> 01:54:04.369
Mommy...

01:54:04.810 --> 01:54:05.970
Mommy...

01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:09.473
My poor daughter...

01:54:12.652 --> 01:54:14.386
- That's right, go Man-gi!
- That's right!

01:54:14.387 --> 01:54:17.652
Grab him and twist him.
That's the way!

01:54:23.229 --> 01:54:27.165
<i>My mother died the year
after meeting Maksoon.</i>

01:54:28.401 --> 01:54:33.703
<i>All her life she missed my father,
but that dream was unfulfilled.</i>

01:54:41.247 --> 01:54:42.976
Put this in the middle.

01:54:46.018 --> 01:54:48.248
Shall we bow to grandma?

01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:16.982
Next, should we hear Seo-yeon?

01:55:16.983 --> 01:55:19.747
Seo-yeon's the best singer.
Give her a hand!

01:55:22.021 --> 01:55:23.420
Stand up straight here.

01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:25.614
Which song will you sing?
Pororo?

01:55:26.192 --> 01:55:26.926
Then what?

01:55:26.927 --> 01:55:29.952
How about your favorite,
"when the Sun Rises?"

01:55:30.463 --> 01:55:31.521
Then what?

01:55:32.231 --> 01:55:40.104

01:55:40.706 --> 01:55:45.243

Dad,

01:56:39.965 --> 01:56:42.399
I kept my promise.

01:56:45.037 --> 01:56:47.005
And I found Maksoon.

01:56:49.675 --> 01:56:52.041
In that sense, I've lived well enough.

01:57:02.521 --> 01:57:03.783
But you know,

01:57:06.826 --> 01:57:09.590
it was so hard...

01:57:31.717 --> 01:57:33.548
Don't cry, Duk-soo.

01:57:35.955 --> 01:57:37.183
Dad.

01:57:42.128 --> 01:57:48.260
I know how hard it was for you.

01:57:50.236 --> 01:57:54.366
And I'll always be thankful.

01:57:56.442 --> 01:58:01.846
You did all the things
that I couldn't do.

01:58:04.450 --> 01:58:05.610
Dad...

01:58:07.052 --> 01:58:11.045
I missed you so much!

01:58:15.461 --> 01:58:16.689
I know...

01:58:18.430 --> 01:58:23.333
I missed you too, always.

01:59:25.064 --> 01:59:27.498
Then what was
your dream as a girl?

01:59:29.635 --> 01:59:35.073
To meet a handsome man,
and have a happy family.

01:59:36.242 --> 01:59:37.641
Congratulations.

01:59:38.611 --> 01:59:40.909
Your dream came true perfectly.

01:59:42.181 --> 01:59:44.115
I don't think so.

01:59:45.818 --> 01:59:50.152
What? You regret marrying me?

01:59:50.890 --> 01:59:54.690
Then why did you marry me?

01:59:55.794 --> 01:59:57.284
Because you're <i>pretty.</i>

02:00:00.032 --> 02:00:02.500
Nice to hear,
even if it's a lie.

02:00:04.937 --> 02:00:07.735
Then why did you marry me?

02:00:09.708 --> 02:00:11.266
Because I love you.

02:00:17.683 --> 02:00:19.947
Nice to hear,
even if it's a lie.

02:00:25.524 --> 02:00:27.048
Let's sell it.

02:00:27.493 --> 02:00:28.517
What?

02:00:29.161 --> 02:00:30.219
The shop.

02:00:31.730 --> 02:00:32.890
Oh my...

02:00:34.199 --> 02:00:36.724
you've finally grown up.

02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:53.009
Surely by now,

02:00:53.852 --> 02:00:55.786
he's too old to come.
