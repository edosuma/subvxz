00:30.481 --> 00:33.548
<i>I'm Detective Reeves.</i>

00:33.550 --> 00:37.386
<i>Today's date is
December 2nd, 1993.</i>

00:39.390 --> 00:43.058
<i>This interview is being recorded
and may be used as evidence.</i>

00:45.629 --> 00:47.429
<i>Please state your name.</i>

00:50.067 --> 00:52.034
<i>My name is Andrew Bennett.</i>

00:53.537 --> 00:57.572
So Andrew, last time we talked,

00:57.574 --> 01:01.376
we discussed what you
did to Laura.

01:09.486 --> 01:13.555
Now, we're going
to talk about him.

01:18.829 --> 01:21.863
Can you tell me who this is,
Andrew?

02:27.631 --> 02:30.132
Still working on this
piece of junk, huh?

02:54.091 --> 02:55.891
Make yourself at home.

04:16.940 --> 04:20.108
I wasn't expecting anyone
for a couple more days.

04:21.945 --> 04:26.181
Yeah, I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.961
Well, I've been better.

05:01.652 --> 05:02.884
And you?

05:05.122 --> 05:07.656
You seem a little lost.

05:10.594 --> 05:12.727
I thought she
was getting better.

05:17.167 --> 05:21.102
I looked at you and I thought,
"Wow."

05:24.141 --> 05:28.977
How can I ever thank you for
what you've done for my family?

05:31.348 --> 05:33.081
What you did for Laura.

05:37.087 --> 05:40.288
You can't blame yourself, Jack.

05:42.793 --> 05:44.593
It doesn't make sense.

05:56.607 --> 05:59.941
What's with the boxes?
You moving?

06:05.315 --> 06:06.681
No.

06:09.920 --> 06:13.788
Just packing a few things away.

06:21.898 --> 06:24.699
How are the funeral preparations
going?

06:27.270 --> 06:30.872
Well, as good as planning
a funeral can go, I guess.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.843
Sorry I haven't been around
to help with any of it.

06:34.845 --> 06:36.711
Well...

06:46.289 --> 06:48.356
You're here now, ain't you?

07:16.420 --> 07:17.852
Jack?

07:23.794 --> 07:25.160
Jack?

08:06.203 --> 08:10.038
<i>I need to know where Jack is.</i>

08:12.175 --> 08:14.342
I'll tell you where he is.

08:17.380 --> 08:21.116
But you're going to listen
to every word I have to say.

08:22.018 --> 08:25.220
Don't fuck with me, Andrew.

08:25.222 --> 08:27.489
I don't have time
for this nonsense!

08:31.461 --> 08:35.797
I won't be home for dinner, you?

08:45.475 --> 08:48.510
I think it's fair you hear
the whole story.

12:44.314 --> 12:46.381
You're overreacting...

13:13.243 --> 13:14.409
Yeah?

13:15.145 --> 13:16.577
<i>I'm going to head to the store</i>

13:16.579 --> 13:19.680
<i>and grab a couple of things
before it closes.</i>

13:22.519 --> 13:24.452
Yeah, okay.

13:33.463 --> 13:35.396
Andrew?

16:27.870 --> 16:29.704
Is this your letter?

16:32.275 --> 16:34.775
Is this your handwriting?

16:38.715 --> 16:40.348
Come on, Andrew.

16:40.650 --> 16:43.651
I need for you to say it
right into the tape.

16:52.895 --> 16:54.495
Yeah.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.898
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

17:06.476 --> 17:07.708
Yeah.

17:10.747 --> 17:12.613
All right.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.815
That wasn't too hard, was it?

17:16.653 --> 17:18.452
Keep going.

18:42.105 --> 18:43.771
We...

18:47.110 --> 18:49.910
We used to dance to this song.

18:59.155 --> 19:00.788
Andrew...

19:06.028 --> 19:07.728
Remember when I said

19:07.730 --> 19:11.599
I didn't know how to thank you
for what you did for Laura?

19:16.406 --> 19:18.739
She's always been
afraid of heights.

19:20.843 --> 19:21.842
Since we were kids.

19:26.749 --> 19:31.852
There was this one time,
a carnival came to town.

19:36.692 --> 19:39.894
We drove past it on the way
home one night.

19:42.698 --> 19:46.867
I'd never seen anything like it
and it didn't look real.

19:51.073 --> 19:54.642
We begged Mom and Dad
to take us.

19:54.644 --> 19:59.980
Finally Mom did,
and when we got there, Laura...

19:59.982 --> 20:02.950
Laura only wanted
to do one thing.

20:04.921 --> 20:06.587
The ferris wheel.

20:10.927 --> 20:14.562
So, we got our tickets
and waited in line.

20:14.564 --> 20:19.567
Laura could hardly stand still,
she was so excited.

20:27.677 --> 20:31.111
So then it was our turn,

20:31.113 --> 20:34.882
and we got on the ride
and everything was fine.

20:36.819 --> 20:41.922
But when we got to the top,

20:41.924 --> 20:44.925
Laura made the mistake
of looking down.

20:49.999 --> 20:53.534
I've never seen anyone
so terrified.

20:53.536 --> 20:55.569
Mom tried to calm her down...

20:56.906 --> 20:58.772
but she passed out.

21:01.143 --> 21:04.545
The ride operator
even called an ambulance.

21:11.521 --> 21:14.555
That was how she
reacted to heights.

21:15.558 --> 21:20.194
So her jumping like that
didn't make sense.

21:22.164 --> 21:23.864
She was afraid of heights.

21:23.866 --> 21:26.000
Why would she go into
the middle of nowhere

21:26.002 --> 21:29.904
and climb to the top of some
goddamn waterfall and jump?

21:34.677 --> 21:36.777
You made it up.

21:38.748 --> 21:41.215
You made up a death
where it would be impossible

21:41.217 --> 21:43.551
to find her body...

21:48.858 --> 21:52.760
Don't go accusing me of
something you can't take back.

21:55.765 --> 21:58.666
I found her glasses
in your fire pit.

22:01.137 --> 22:04.238
I tried to tell myself
I was wrong.

22:04.240 --> 22:08.042
That I was overreacting
like I usually do, but...

22:18.821 --> 22:22.856
I always looked to you

22:22.858 --> 22:27.127
as the person
that saved my family.

22:27.129 --> 22:30.364
I never thought you'd be
the one who destroyed it.

22:30.366 --> 22:33.100
Now you put that down
before somebody gets hurt.

22:33.102 --> 22:34.868
Don't come any closer.

22:34.870 --> 22:36.837
You killed my fucking sister!

22:36.839 --> 22:38.872
That's enough!

22:38.874 --> 22:43.177
Now you listen to me and
you listen to me good, boy.

22:43.179 --> 22:46.814
You're looking for answers
right now and they ain't there.

22:48.918 --> 22:51.986
You want to believe she wouldn't
kill herself? I do too.

22:51.988 --> 22:52.886
I do too!

22:57.727 --> 23:01.095
You know deep down
your sister wasn't well.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.232
I stood by her, Jack.

23:06.102 --> 23:09.837
I took care of her,
and I loved her.

23:11.173 --> 23:13.407
Where were you in all this?

23:14.310 --> 23:15.376
Yeah.

23:15.378 --> 23:20.147
You know, I think I liked you
better when you were a drunk.

23:25.855 --> 23:28.288
We're a family, Jack.

23:28.290 --> 23:31.425
And we need to be a family
right now more than ever.

23:31.427 --> 23:33.327
So you put that down.

23:34.764 --> 23:36.130
Put it down.

23:57.820 --> 23:59.787
I'm sorry.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.399
Hello?

26:26.969 --> 26:28.502
Help!

26:36.078 --> 26:38.912
Andrew. What are you doing,
Andrew?

26:38.914 --> 26:40.013
Just wait a minute, okay?

26:40.015 --> 26:42.282
Wait for a second, just wait!

27:03.405 --> 27:07.641
If it means anything,
it was an accident.

27:37.072 --> 27:40.107
Families have differences
all the time.

27:43.412 --> 27:47.080
I guess the truth is, I didn't
know what to do with him.

27:48.450 --> 27:50.183
I'll say.

27:52.454 --> 27:55.155
Hold that thought,
I'll be right back.

28:20.182 --> 28:22.983
Alright man,
let's get back to it.

28:31.226 --> 28:33.160
What the fuck is so funny?

28:33.162 --> 28:36.029
You won't find him.

28:36.031 --> 28:37.597
What?

28:41.737 --> 28:44.271
You won't find him.

28:55.751 --> 28:59.052
I know you went to go have a
chat with your little buddies,

28:59.054 --> 29:00.454
but uh...

29:02.758 --> 29:06.460
Yeah, you're just wasting time.

29:13.035 --> 29:15.302
<i>We got into an argument.</i>

29:16.405 --> 29:18.238
<i>Things got heated.</i>

29:20.743 --> 29:26.113
<i>I wanted to help her,
but it was a real mess.</i>

29:30.652 --> 29:33.020
<i>I'm not a monster, Jack.</i>

29:37.793 --> 29:42.029
This isn't happening.
It's not real!

29:45.067 --> 29:48.035
Help!

29:51.640 --> 29:53.373
Alright.

29:56.078 --> 30:00.714
After you chained Jack
to the tree,

30:00.716 --> 30:03.650
what was your plan?

30:09.491 --> 30:13.527
The woods can be a very scary
place, detective.

30:20.135 --> 30:22.069
Hello?

30:24.573 --> 30:26.540
Somebody?

30:36.618 --> 30:39.352
You weren't supposed to be here.

30:42.291 --> 30:45.492
If you were here when you
were supposed to be,

30:45.494 --> 30:47.594
this never would've happened.

33:11.340 --> 33:13.640
I need more.

33:13.642 --> 33:15.342
Please.

33:59.354 --> 34:03.323
I saw your pills.

34:05.894 --> 34:07.394
It's okay, Andrew.

34:07.396 --> 34:11.931
Whatever it is,
we can still fix this.

34:19.608 --> 34:21.408
Help!

34:21.409 --> 34:25.478
Help, please! Somebody help me.

34:27.449 --> 34:32.886
Help! Help! Anybody!

34:36.024 --> 34:37.791
Help...

34:50.505 --> 34:52.072
Andrew.

35:07.956 --> 35:10.824
I won't say anything.

35:32.614 --> 35:33.680
No...

35:41.490 --> 35:43.056
Shit.

36:38.213 --> 36:40.079
I'm leaving you.

36:42.150 --> 36:43.616
What?

36:45.454 --> 36:47.921
Yeah, you heard me.

36:49.591 --> 36:50.924
I'm leaving you.

37:03.872 --> 37:06.172
<i>So, where were we?</i>

37:15.851 --> 37:18.718
I wish it didn't
have to be this way.

37:19.521 --> 37:20.820
It doesn't.

37:22.924 --> 37:25.091
You're a good person, Jack.

37:28.029 --> 37:30.096
Just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

37:30.098 --> 37:32.232
Yeah, no shit.

37:36.838 --> 37:40.640
People are gonna start
realizing I'm missing.

37:42.611 --> 37:44.911
Yeah, I know.

37:46.681 --> 37:50.216
This will be the first place
they'll look for me.

37:50.218 --> 37:54.287
I told people I was staying
with you for Laura's funeral.

38:12.874 --> 38:14.741
Don't be stupid.

38:17.746 --> 38:19.579
Now go.

38:21.316 --> 38:23.116
Go tinkle.

39:07.262 --> 39:10.063
I'll be back tomorrow.

41:25.033 --> 41:26.766
What's going on?

41:29.370 --> 41:31.404
Where am I?

41:51.493 --> 41:54.093
What the fuck are you
smiling at?

41:57.799 --> 42:02.368
You bringing me here...

42:04.906 --> 42:06.372
you care.

42:07.809 --> 42:11.210
The Andrew I know
is still in there.

42:19.521 --> 42:21.320
Tomorrow's the funeral.

42:22.423 --> 42:24.490
It's my sister's funeral.

42:28.263 --> 42:30.062
Andrew?

42:31.900 --> 42:33.900
Andrew!

42:33.902 --> 42:36.803
It's my sister's funeral,
Andrew.

42:37.539 --> 42:39.238
Andrew...

43:47.041 --> 43:49.876
I heard them again last night.

43:53.214 --> 43:54.947
Heard who?

44:03.324 --> 44:05.024
The wolves.

44:11.165 --> 44:13.132
And out come the wolves, Jack.

44:15.603 --> 44:17.470
What do you mean, wolves?

44:18.907 --> 44:21.474
He started seeing things.

44:23.044 --> 44:24.977
Things that
weren't really there.

44:27.015 --> 44:29.448
He told me he saw Laura.

44:36.324 --> 44:37.657
Jack.

44:40.495 --> 44:41.928
Jack.

44:43.698 --> 44:44.997
Wake up.

44:48.469 --> 44:50.169
Laura?

44:51.005 --> 44:53.039
Shhh, it's okay.

44:55.310 --> 44:56.709
Don't panic.

45:00.348 --> 45:02.949
I found your glasses.

45:05.286 --> 45:07.186
I saw your teeth.

45:10.725 --> 45:12.525
It's Andrew.

45:13.061 --> 45:16.062
He's lost his shit
and he's gone crazy!

45:18.066 --> 45:19.966
You look so scared.

45:22.971 --> 45:25.404
Everything's going to be okay.

45:36.651 --> 45:40.453
What are you doing out here
all by yourself?

45:40.455 --> 45:43.389
Because your psycho husband
brought me out here

45:43.391 --> 45:45.758
when I found out
what happened to you!

45:47.562 --> 45:49.161
No.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.532
No...

45:55.036 --> 46:00.172
I mean, why are you here,

46:00.174 --> 46:02.308
instead of at my funeral, Jack?

46:04.012 --> 46:06.078
Why aren't you at my funeral?

46:07.148 --> 46:10.783
I'm buried in the ground
and you can't even show up?

46:14.655 --> 46:16.756
I'm sorry, Laura!

47:18.519 --> 47:20.686
I wish you could
have been there.

47:23.224 --> 47:25.224
What did you tell everyone?

47:27.762 --> 47:29.528
Oh, sorry.

47:34.102 --> 47:37.169
Jack really wanted to make it
for his sister's funeral,

47:37.171 --> 47:39.672
but I'm actually the one
who killed Laura.

47:39.674 --> 47:41.607
And Jack found out,
so I brought him

47:41.609 --> 47:44.410
into the middle of the woods
and chained him up to a tree

47:44.412 --> 47:48.214
so he couldn't make it,
but he sends his condolences!

49:13.267 --> 49:15.701
So tell me about your
interactions with the family

49:15.703 --> 49:17.536
on the day of the funeral.

49:20.908 --> 49:23.742
Come on now Andrew,
stay with me.

49:23.744 --> 49:25.744
Alright, this is important.

49:29.283 --> 49:31.750
And now to share a few
loving memories of Laura,

49:31.752 --> 49:33.919
is her husband, Andrew Bennett.

49:57.545 --> 50:00.446
I ain't too much
for speaking in crowds,

50:00.448 --> 50:03.616
so please bear with me.

50:11.993 --> 50:16.462
I was up last night, and uh...

50:18.766 --> 50:24.703
I was thinking of what I should
say at a time like this.

50:27.475 --> 50:28.707
But uh...

50:43.924 --> 50:46.625
Well, luckily I was
on my way over here today

50:46.627 --> 50:49.795
and I started
thinking about Laura.

50:50.731 --> 50:54.366
And how if you really knew her,

50:54.368 --> 50:58.537
you just knew she had
that way about her where...

51:00.675 --> 51:03.375
She could just walk
into a room and...

51:04.912 --> 51:07.346
Just make it a little brighter.

51:19.760 --> 51:23.028
She had a kind word
to say about most.

51:23.030 --> 51:24.430
And uh...

51:27.702 --> 51:29.635
If you ever...

51:32.440 --> 51:34.340
needed anything.

51:35.710 --> 51:41.747
you know she'd just... you know?

51:45.486 --> 51:48.420
I just kept thinking
about her hands.

51:51.492 --> 51:52.891
How when she'd get excited,

51:52.893 --> 51:56.462
they'd do this little dance
across her lap.

51:56.464 --> 51:57.730
Or...

51:58.899 --> 52:01.033
How when we first met...

52:05.473 --> 52:09.141
I don't know, it took me
about a year to ask her out.

52:09.143 --> 52:13.612
But luckily I did
and she said yes.

52:15.850 --> 52:19.017
I asked her to the movies

52:19.019 --> 52:24.490
and I found myself trembling
outside this movie theater,

52:24.492 --> 52:25.824
and uh...

52:32.500 --> 52:34.400
I was terrified.

52:36.670 --> 52:41.707
Then all of a sudden this little
hand just slides into mine.

52:42.543 --> 52:43.842
And...

52:47.581 --> 52:51.984
All those worries,
all that fear...

53:00.127 --> 53:03.629
I remember looking at her
that night and thinking

53:03.631 --> 53:07.199
that this is the woman I want to
spend the rest of my life with.

53:14.008 --> 53:17.209
I guess we never really
made it that far.

53:18.679 --> 53:20.512
But I love you.

53:23.984 --> 53:25.184
Thank you, father.

53:43.838 --> 53:45.103
Hello?

53:48.175 --> 53:50.008
Holy shit!

53:50.010 --> 53:53.579
What happened to you?
Are you okay?

53:53.581 --> 53:55.981
You have to let me out of here,
please!

53:55.983 --> 53:58.083
Of course, hold on.

54:00.020 --> 54:01.220
Shit!

54:15.236 --> 54:16.802
I'm going to need to go get help

54:16.804 --> 54:18.537
to cut the locks off
these chains.

54:18.539 --> 54:19.738
Okay?

54:19.740 --> 54:20.973
Okay.

54:20.975 --> 54:22.007
I will be right back.

54:22.009 --> 54:23.509
Okay.

54:37.091 --> 54:39.157
Who are you talking to, Jack?

54:42.997 --> 54:48.267
You remind me of this pet
I had when I was a kid.

54:54.775 --> 54:57.209
He was an ugly little thing.

54:58.712 --> 55:00.212
A guinea pig.

55:03.617 --> 55:08.253
Well like I said, I was a kid.

55:08.255 --> 55:12.758
And uh, one day I got this idea
in my head.

55:14.028 --> 55:17.296
I wanted to teach him
how to swim.

55:17.298 --> 55:19.064
So...

55:21.035 --> 55:25.237
I got this plastic bag
and I put him in there

55:25.239 --> 55:26.872
and I tied the bag up
real tight,

55:26.874 --> 55:29.041
and I tied this little piece
of rope around the bag

55:29.043 --> 55:31.910
just to make it snug.

55:33.180 --> 55:36.815
And uh, I hauled off and...

55:41.755 --> 55:43.889
Threw that bag way out
into the lake.

55:47.661 --> 55:50.162
I just stood on the shore

55:50.164 --> 55:53.932
watching the tide drag that bag
further and further away.

56:01.075 --> 56:03.809
Remember I was
real upset by this.

56:08.115 --> 56:10.182
I started to run along
the shore.

56:11.752 --> 56:13.218
I started crying.

56:15.322 --> 56:17.122
I figured I'd lost him.

56:19.827 --> 56:23.629
I figured my folks were gonna
tend my hide when I got home.

56:25.132 --> 56:28.333
But a little ways down
this river bank...

56:31.672 --> 56:34.006
I look down and I see
this plastic bag

56:34.008 --> 56:38.276
with something just trying
to claw its way out.

56:40.848 --> 56:43.048
I run over, tear open the bag

56:43.050 --> 56:45.717
and sure as shit,
it's my little buddy.

56:51.225 --> 56:55.127
He's looking up at me,
soaking wet.

56:56.063 --> 56:58.664
Eyes are bulged
right out of his head.

56:58.666 --> 57:00.732
And he's shocked.

57:04.271 --> 57:06.071
Right then and there...

57:07.141 --> 57:09.441
I promised I would always
take care of him.

57:11.779 --> 57:14.246
And I'd never let anything
happen to him.

57:15.849 --> 57:18.450
See I realized I loved
the little guy.

57:21.822 --> 57:24.122
Well, next morning...

57:27.061 --> 57:29.127
I wake up all excited.

57:30.364 --> 57:33.465
I run downstairs to check
on my pal and, uh...

57:38.839 --> 57:41.106
Just like that he was gone.

57:44.378 --> 57:48.080
Sometime in the night, alone.

57:50.751 --> 57:53.452
Maybe scared he left.

57:58.292 --> 58:03.128
You see Jack,
I don't want you to leave.

58:06.433 --> 58:08.333
You're all I've got.

58:33.327 --> 58:35.494
You know the irony
in all of this?

58:37.965 --> 58:40.065
I named the little fella Jack.

58:52.780 --> 58:54.012
Hungry?

59:51.839 --> 59:52.938
<i>Andrew.</i>

59:54.875 --> 59:56.208
Chief.

59:56.210 --> 59:58.610
<i>Just want to offer you
my condolences.</i>

59:58.612 --> 01:00:02.414
<i>And I'm wondering if I can
speak to you for a moment.</i>

01:00:03.283 --> 01:00:07.085
<i>Maybe inside?
It's a little warmer.</i>

01:00:33.647 --> 01:00:35.247
So?

01:00:35.249 --> 01:00:40.252
I want to talk to you about your
brother-in-law, Jack Rodgers.

01:00:44.925 --> 01:00:46.491
What about him?

01:00:47.895 --> 01:00:49.995
He's been reported missing.

01:00:49.997 --> 01:00:52.464
His mother filed
a report yesterday

01:00:52.466 --> 01:00:55.267
and she was concerned
about his welfare.

01:00:55.269 --> 01:00:57.168
We talked to a few of
the relatives and friends

01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:59.337
and they all said that he
was supposed to be staying here

01:00:59.339 --> 01:01:01.907
with you this week
for the funeral.

01:01:04.344 --> 01:01:05.911
Yeah...

01:01:08.348 --> 01:01:10.215
He never showed up.

01:01:12.519 --> 01:01:14.920
You never thought
to call your in-laws,

01:01:14.922 --> 01:01:16.588
see if Jack was there?

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:19.190
Heck, you could've reported him
missing yourself.

01:01:23.196 --> 01:01:26.097
I just didn't figure there
anything to report.

01:01:27.034 --> 01:01:31.970
Jack was always the kind of guy
to just get up and...

01:01:38.445 --> 01:01:41.546
I figured it was his way
of dealing with things.

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:48.586
We... didn't really talk much.

01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:52.390
I see.

01:01:52.392 --> 01:01:55.493
Well, do you have any idea
where he might be?

01:01:55.495 --> 01:01:58.496
Other friends' places?
Girlfriend?

01:02:00.434 --> 01:02:02.000
No.

01:02:04.705 --> 01:02:06.137
Right.

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:10.442
How about having a look around
the place while I'm here?

01:02:10.444 --> 01:02:12.344
Is that okay with you?

01:02:14.181 --> 01:02:16.715
You looking for something
in particular?

01:02:16.717 --> 01:02:21.286
No, I just thought I'd take a
little looksie because I'm here.

01:02:21.288 --> 01:02:23.254
If that's okay with you.

01:02:28.362 --> 01:02:30.061
Got a warrant?

01:02:31.198 --> 01:02:33.465
No, I don't.

01:02:33.467 --> 01:02:35.266
Do I need one?

01:02:45.412 --> 01:02:48.013
I think it's time to leave.

01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:31.489
Jack...

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:35.193
Jack!

01:03:43.203 --> 01:03:46.271
Thought I lost you there
for a second there, buddy.

01:03:48.108 --> 01:03:50.341
Wouldn't matter anyway.

01:03:53.847 --> 01:03:56.114
I'm going to die here.

01:03:59.486 --> 01:04:01.586
You don't know that yet.

01:04:18.638 --> 01:04:22.107
Whatever this is,
we can work it out.

01:04:22.109 --> 01:04:24.809
I love you so much.

01:04:27.114 --> 01:04:31.382
But you need to get help, okay?

01:04:34.254 --> 01:04:38.490
And I'm not going
to be here anymore.

01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:52.537
Andrew, you let go...

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:19.497
Oh my god, Laura.

01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:26.437
Laura, sweetie.

01:05:30.177 --> 01:05:31.943
Laura wake up, come on!

01:05:35.782 --> 01:05:37.849
Laura, please wake up.

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:41.586
Laura, please wake up.

01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:52.263
Wake up!

01:05:52.265 --> 01:05:54.499
Come on, wake up!

01:05:57.871 --> 01:06:00.638
No, no, no...

01:06:01.942 --> 01:06:04.242
Laura, please no!

01:07:28.928 --> 01:07:31.029
How you doing, Andrew?

01:07:31.031 --> 01:07:32.497
Can we continue?

01:07:47.514 --> 01:07:49.814
You seem quiet today, Jack.

01:08:43.136 --> 01:08:44.935
Here's your search warrant.

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:25.576
Hey Chief!

01:09:36.488 --> 01:09:37.822
Found this.

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:42.727
Citalopram.

01:09:44.029 --> 01:09:45.897
What is that?

01:09:45.899 --> 01:09:48.633
It's used to treat
anxiety and depression.

01:09:50.837 --> 01:09:52.737
<i>I think I got something!</i>

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.747
This matches the
exact make and model

01:10:02.749 --> 01:10:05.183
of Jack Rodger's missing car.

01:10:06.686 --> 01:10:09.887
Well, you cracked the case.

01:10:11.825 --> 01:10:13.624
That is Jack's car.

01:10:15.595 --> 01:10:18.696
Mind telling me what it's doing
in your possession?

01:10:20.733 --> 01:10:22.567
I'm a mechanic.

01:10:24.771 --> 01:10:27.972
Jack asked me to
take a look at it.

01:10:29.142 --> 01:10:33.144
With everything happening,
I haven't had time.

01:10:36.115 --> 01:10:37.582
Let's tow the car.

01:10:38.751 --> 01:10:40.718
Excuse me?

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:41.986
I'm getting real tired

01:10:41.988 --> 01:10:44.655
of your little story and act
here, Mr. Bennett.

01:10:44.657 --> 01:10:46.591
Things aren't adding up.

01:10:48.061 --> 01:10:50.127
You have no right
to take anything.

01:10:50.129 --> 01:10:51.596
Shame on you.

01:10:51.598 --> 01:10:53.798
I got a warrant that says I do.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.533
We're towing that car.

01:10:56.803 --> 01:10:58.236
Why don't you take Sparky here

01:10:58.238 --> 01:11:00.238
and get the fuck off
my property?

01:11:03.076 --> 01:11:05.743
You know what, Andrew?

01:11:05.745 --> 01:11:09.580
I think you know exactly
where Jack Rodgers is.

01:11:09.582 --> 01:11:14.051
And I'm going to find him,
and when I do,

01:11:14.053 --> 01:11:17.188
I'm putting the cuffs on you
and you're going to jail.

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:19.023
How about that?

01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:20.224
Tow the car!

01:11:21.728 --> 01:11:24.662
Go on, go inside.

01:11:25.632 --> 01:11:26.898
Cocksucker.

01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:25.856
What's the occasion?

01:13:03.329 --> 01:13:04.895
Listen buddy...

01:13:08.101 --> 01:13:10.001
I don't want you to
make this harder on yourself

01:13:10.003 --> 01:13:11.969
than it has to be.

01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:14.005
Andrew, I won't say anything!

01:13:32.392 --> 01:13:34.659
I think we both know
you're going to rat on me

01:13:34.661 --> 01:13:36.160
the first chance you get.

01:13:38.965 --> 01:13:41.732
Andrew, please.

01:13:48.241 --> 01:13:49.440
I'll...

01:13:51.978 --> 01:13:55.146
I'll give you a little time
to get good with this.

01:14:19.138 --> 01:14:21.739
Andrew, no.

01:14:21.741 --> 01:14:24.308
Please, just talk to me Andrew!

01:14:41.794 --> 01:14:44.395
Andrew, wait.

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:47.231
Just talk to me, please wait!

01:14:47.233 --> 01:14:49.066
Fuck!

01:15:21.768 --> 01:15:23.968
Jack, wake up!

01:15:28.908 --> 01:15:30.808
It's time to go, buddy.

01:15:41.487 --> 01:15:43.921
I'm not gonna tell you again,
Jack.

01:16:20.827 --> 01:16:23.160
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:16:25.097 --> 01:16:27.031
There's no need to run.

01:16:29.101 --> 01:16:30.568
I love you...

01:16:32.605 --> 01:16:34.438
And I'll see you soon.

01:23:19.345 --> 01:23:21.010
Mr. Bennett,

01:23:21.012 --> 01:23:22.678
we're here to take you in for
questioning in relation to...

01:23:22.681 --> 01:23:23.513
Gun!

01:23:23.515 --> 01:23:25.015
Put your weapon down!

01:23:27.386 --> 01:23:29.953
Put that goddamn gun down now!

01:23:30.856 --> 01:23:35.959
Bennett! Drop your weapon.
Now put it on the ground.

01:23:37.296 --> 01:23:39.263
Do it now, Bennett.

01:23:39.999 --> 01:23:41.932
Back away - two steps!

01:23:44.503 --> 01:23:46.970
Keep him covered.
Hands above your head!

01:23:50.843 --> 01:23:53.910
Andrew Bennett,
I'm placing you under arrest.

01:23:54.847 --> 01:23:57.014
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:23:58.851 --> 01:24:01.518
Anything you say, can and will
be used against you

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.353
in a court of law.

01:24:03.355 --> 01:24:05.789
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:24:05.791 --> 01:24:08.292
Now, you have the right
to have an attorney present

01:24:08.294 --> 01:24:09.359
during questioning.

01:24:09.361 --> 01:24:10.627
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:11.662
one will be appointed for you.

01:24:11.664 --> 01:24:13.463
Do you understand these rights?

01:24:14.333 --> 01:24:16.433
Come on, let's go.

01:24:24.743 --> 01:24:26.810
So you mean to tell me that you

01:24:26.812 --> 01:24:30.480
just walked right up
to Jack and shot him?

01:24:32.318 --> 01:24:33.517
Twice?

01:24:38.324 --> 01:24:39.589
Well...

01:24:40.859 --> 01:24:44.828
Not every story has a
happy ending, detective.

01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:49.032
You sat here all this time
feeding me this bullshit story.

01:24:50.569 --> 01:24:53.937
When all I wanted to know
was where Jack is.

01:24:57.543 --> 01:24:59.076
You wanna know where Jack is?

01:24:59.078 --> 01:25:01.945
Just check the fire pit
in my back yard.

01:25:03.916 --> 01:25:07.417
<i>So let me get this straight...</i>

01:25:07.419 --> 01:25:10.754
<i>You took your brother-in-law out
in the middle of the woods,</i>

01:25:10.756 --> 01:25:14.791
<i>chained him to a tree
and left him to die?</i>

01:25:18.364 --> 01:25:21.598
<i>I took him out there
to explain things to him.</i>

01:25:23.068 --> 01:25:26.937
<i>That's a whole lot of work.
Why all the trouble?</i>

01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:34.711
<i>Well, we're family.</i>

01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:47.424
<i>Families have differences
all the time.</i>

01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:56.099
<i>I guess the truth is I didn't
know what to do with him.</i>

01:25:56.101 --> 01:25:58.001
<i>I'll say.</i>

01:26:00.038 --> 01:26:02.672
<i>Hold that thought,
I'll be right back.</i>

01:30:23.935 --> 01:30:25.368
What's this, Andrew?

01:30:30.275 --> 01:30:34.077
It reads like you were
trying to off yourself.

01:30:41.687 --> 01:30:43.920
You still not talking, huh?

01:30:43.922 --> 01:30:46.423
Well, let me tell you
what I think.

01:30:48.126 --> 01:30:50.827
<i>I think the day you
went to kill Jack,</i>

01:30:50.829 --> 01:30:53.863
<i>you wrote a suicide letter.</i>

01:30:53.865 --> 01:30:55.899
<i>You weren't going
to kill Jack...</i>

01:30:56.968 --> 01:30:59.135
<i>You were going
to kill yourself.</i>

01:31:07.846 --> 01:31:11.715
<i>You just couldn't take
the stress or guilt anymore.</i>

01:31:44.416 --> 01:31:47.751
<i>But you couldn't do it,
could you?</i>

01:32:02.834 --> 01:32:06.836
<i>I reviewed the police report
from your arrest that day.</i>

01:32:06.838 --> 01:32:10.273
<i>It says you were already
armed when officers arrived.</i>

01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:18.181
<i>That you put the gun
against your own head.</i>

01:32:18.183 --> 01:32:19.783
Hold your fire!

01:32:21.486 --> 01:32:24.954
Put the weapon down.
It's going to be okay.

01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:27.223
<i>They ruined your plan,
didn't they?</i>

01:32:27.225 --> 01:32:32.262
<i>But of course, you knew by
that point it was all over.</i>

01:32:33.231 --> 01:32:34.397
Keep him covered.

01:32:35.901 --> 01:32:38.368
Tell me where Jack is!

01:32:44.142 --> 01:32:45.441
Alright.

01:32:50.048 --> 01:32:52.282
You know, I sat here...

01:32:53.351 --> 01:32:59.088
and listened to every word
you had to say.

01:33:01.126 --> 01:33:02.992
The way you wanted.

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:12.969
But I'm tired of your stupid
fucking games, Andrew Bennett.

01:33:20.045 --> 01:33:23.880
So I want you to get up
on your feet.

01:33:31.489 --> 01:33:34.457
I said get on your feet!

01:33:43.335 --> 01:33:47.203
And you're going to help me
find Jack, alright?

01:33:48.573 --> 01:33:50.006
Where's Jack?

01:33:53.378 --> 01:33:55.211
I said, where's Jack?

01:34:02.187 --> 01:34:05.288
Where is he?

01:34:11.129 --> 01:34:14.030
Where is he?

01:35:03.281 --> 01:35:04.681
Was it worth it?

01:35:06.718 --> 01:35:10.620
All the lies, the make believe.

01:35:20.131 --> 01:35:21.331
Man...

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.541
Man, everybody
makes bad decisions.

01:35:35.046 --> 01:35:38.648
We have to live
with the consequences.

01:35:53.031 --> 01:35:57.300
I think that if Laura
were here right now...

01:36:00.638 --> 01:36:06.342
I think she'd want you to
tell her where her brother is.

01:36:20.325 --> 01:36:22.425
Tell me where Jack is.

01:36:29.534 --> 01:36:30.767
Huh?

01:36:43.048 --> 01:36:45.581
Here, write it down.

01:37:15.413 --> 01:37:18.181
All right people, listen up.

01:37:18.183 --> 01:37:20.316
We're looking for this man.

01:37:20.318 --> 01:37:22.618
His name is Jack Rodgers

01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:27.323
and he's somewhere out there,
chained inside a shed.

01:37:31.329 --> 01:37:33.296
You've got whistles.

01:37:33.298 --> 01:37:37.366
If you see anything, no matter
how small, go ahead.

01:37:37.368 --> 01:37:41.270
Make a sound and we'll
converge on your location.

01:37:43.141 --> 01:37:46.742
Remember, he's been
out here for days now.

01:37:46.744 --> 01:37:51.848
He's cold, hungry,
possibly injured.

01:37:54.686 --> 01:37:59.555
It's my hope, no scratch that,
it's my belief,

01:37:59.557 --> 01:38:01.624
that he's still alive.

01:38:03.661 --> 01:38:06.129
Alright, he's counting on us.

01:38:07.866 --> 01:38:09.765
Let's bring Jack home.

01:39:04.355 --> 01:39:06.222
Get those chains off him.

01:39:12.297 --> 01:39:14.197
Come on...

01:39:29.686 --> 01:39:34.686
