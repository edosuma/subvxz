00:28.700 --> 00:31.966
...The Minnesota Pee Wee
Championship is up for grabs.

00:32.037 --> 00:35.566
Both teams playing like there's
no tomorrow. Duluth, in the Hawks'zone,

00:35.676 --> 00:38.143
looking for a chance to win it.
Only a few seconds remain.

00:38.211 --> 00:41.009
There's a pass out to the blue line.
Intercepted by Gordon Bombay!

00:41.080 --> 00:43.344
Bombay! He's got a breakaway.

00:43.416 --> 00:46.044
Across the blue line all alone
for a chance to win the game!

00:46.152 --> 00:48.917
He's pulled down from behind
by Fox of Duluth.

00:49.023 --> 00:52.186
Fox definitely pulled him down
from behind and this could be -

00:52.259 --> 00:55.091
Yes, the referee calls
for a penalty shot.

01:06.674 --> 01:11.372
Gordon, it's up to you. I don't wanna
see any goats around after the game.

01:11.444 --> 01:14.709
You got it?
Now, you miss this shot...

01:14.781 --> 01:18.240
you're not just lettin' me down,
you're lettin' your team down.

01:39.705 --> 01:41.971
Apressure situation he's in now.

01:42.077 --> 01:45.739
The 1973 Pee Wee State
Championship now rests...

01:45.813 --> 01:50.750
on the little shoulders
of number 9, Gordon Bombay.

01:56.957 --> 02:06.493
Gordon! Gordon!

02:37.432 --> 02:41.266
Let's go, son!
All right!

03:02.290 --> 03:06.159
He hit the goalpost!
What a heartbreaker!

03:06.228 --> 03:09.287
Little Gordon Bombay
had the chance -

03:46.463 --> 03:50.524
All my client did was attempt
to give you what you wanted!

03:50.601 --> 03:52.569
Isn't that right?

03:52.636 --> 03:55.572
This man put his neck
on the line for your greed.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.733
Objection. Your Honour?

03:57.809 --> 04:00.038
Will both counsellors
approach the bench?

04:03.380 --> 04:06.714
What's he doing?

04:06.785 --> 04:09.379
I don't have anything to tell you.
I just wanna make a point.

04:09.454 --> 04:11.888
So nod like I'm saying
something important.

04:11.923 --> 04:15.086
- Mr. Bombay?
- Gordon, what are you doing?

04:15.160 --> 04:17.957
- Get out there and be my lawyer.
- Perfect.

04:18.062 --> 04:20.428
This drives him nuts
and I love it.

04:22.132 --> 04:24.966
Nice tie, Frank.
You wore that yesterday, didn't ya?

04:25.070 --> 04:28.164
Oh, Mr. Bombay,
I'm so glad you could make it.

04:28.273 --> 04:31.731
Please restrict yourself
to a relevant cross-examination!

04:31.810 --> 04:35.143
Your Honour, the applicability
of societal intent...

04:35.246 --> 04:37.612
vis-a-vis individual action
is well established.

04:37.682 --> 04:40.583
I'm citing
Minneapolis V. Higgins.

04:40.652 --> 04:45.750
The appellant court overruled a judge
who disallowed similar testimony.

04:45.858 --> 04:49.954
Now, if I'm not mistaken,
that was... you.

04:50.029 --> 04:51.962
Wasn't it,Judge Weathers?

04:52.030 --> 04:56.433
I stand corrected, counsellor.
Objection overruled.

04:56.501 --> 05:00.302
Oh,you really stooped
to an all-time low on this, Bombay.

05:00.372 --> 05:04.035
I'm insulted, Frank.
You have no idea how low I can stoop.

05:04.143 --> 05:06.668
I don't mind losing.
I would just like to lose fair.

05:06.779 --> 05:09.713
Losing fair is still losing, Frank.
Gotta go for the "W" every time.

05:09.814 --> 05:12.477
And what about justice?
That man should be in jail.

05:12.551 --> 05:15.543
It was your job to put him there.
Don't take it out on me!

05:15.654 --> 05:19.317
Next time do your job,
Frankie boy.

05:19.391 --> 05:21.791
- 30 and 0! I remain undefeated.
- What about the Frazier case?

05:21.861 --> 05:24.886
We don't count that one because
I scored with the court reporter.

05:24.996 --> 05:27.659
- The one you said had the intelligent body?
- That's the one.

05:27.733 --> 05:29.667
- No calls on the Duck phone?
- Not yet.

05:29.735 --> 05:31.999
What's he waiting for?
I saw him in the back of the courtroom.

05:32.071 --> 05:34.301
How about some kudos here, huh?

05:34.373 --> 05:37.308
Mr. Tolbert dropped off ringside
seats for tonight's North Stars game.

05:37.376 --> 05:39.709
Hockey?
Forget it!

05:39.813 --> 05:41.837
Gordon, here's the research
for the Pearlstein Project.

05:41.914 --> 05:44.041
- Can you get started?
- Jane!

05:44.150 --> 05:47.051
Can't you see I'm reveling here?
Today I'm 30 and 0!

05:47.153 --> 05:51.385
- 30 and one.
- Type,Jeannie, don't speak.

05:51.490 --> 05:54.426
Mr. Bombay's office.

05:54.528 --> 05:57.986
Yes. It's Ducksworth.
You're right. He wants to see you.

05:58.063 --> 06:01.658
Ha-ha-ha!
Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth!

06:01.734 --> 06:06.195
It was nothing, Mr. Ducksworth.
Quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth.

06:09.075 --> 06:11.669
Gordon, another fine job today.

06:11.745 --> 06:14.509
- Thank you, sir.
- Just one thing.

06:14.581 --> 06:18.073
Score. Don't spike.

06:18.185 --> 06:20.847
I'm not sure I understand
what you mean, sir.

06:20.921 --> 06:24.413
This is a business.
It isn't a game.

06:24.524 --> 06:27.015
Next time a little
restraint might be in order.

06:37.115 --> 06:41.950
~Hey, man, get off my back
I'm doin'the best I can,yeah ~

06:44.590 --> 06:46.581
~ You bust my neck
Cut no slack ~

06:46.658 --> 06:52.596
- ~Forget your fellow man
Yeah yeah uh-huh ~

06:52.663 --> 06:56.759
- Pull your vehicle over to the right, now!
- This is not good.

07:05.077 --> 07:07.601
- ~ Hey, man, whoa yeah yeah ~
- Licence, please.

07:07.678 --> 07:12.309
- Could you turn down the stereo?
- Sure.

07:12.418 --> 07:14.443
I guess it was a "widdle" noisy.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.613
A "widdle"?

07:16.688 --> 07:19.589
Okay, I'm taking you down to precinct.
Breath, blood or urine?

07:19.658 --> 07:22.286
No, thanks, I'm full.

07:22.361 --> 07:25.660
Okay, out of the car. Now.

07:25.764 --> 07:29.860
The charges against Mr. Bombay
are driving under the influence,

07:29.968 --> 07:33.802
driving with an open container
and reckless endangerment.

07:33.872 --> 07:37.468
And to think I almost
stayed home this morning.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.943
I assume you're
representing yourself?

07:40.012 --> 07:44.449
Twelve moving violations in three years?
How do you still have a licence?

07:44.516 --> 07:47.110
Okay, let's talk business.
What am I facing?

07:47.186 --> 07:50.281
Suspension of licence?
Fines? What?

07:50.356 --> 07:53.655
Yes, unless the D.A.'s office will allow
you to plead guilty to lesser charges.

07:53.726 --> 07:57.058
But that's solely
up to the prosecutor.

07:57.162 --> 08:00.222
The city of Minneapolis does not wish
to pursue a plea bargain in this case.

08:00.332 --> 08:04.235
- Hmm.
- Gotta go for the "W," right, Gordo?

08:04.337 --> 08:08.137
The defendant is released
on his own recognizance.

08:11.377 --> 08:15.142
Mr. Ducksworth.
What are you doing here?

08:15.214 --> 08:18.013
I own the place.
How about you?

08:18.084 --> 08:20.848
Just goin' over a few cases.
RICOH Statute stuff.

08:20.920 --> 08:24.219
Oh, I thought you might be
researching your defence...

08:24.324 --> 08:28.420
against D.U.I.
and reckless endangerment.

08:28.528 --> 08:31.588
Did you think I wouldn't
find out, Gordon?

08:31.698 --> 08:33.859
There was no reason to concern you
with it, sir. They have no case.

08:33.933 --> 08:37.528
Frank Huddy just wants my scalp. I found
a loophole. I'm gonna plead not guilty -

08:37.604 --> 08:40.732
Gordon, stop it.
There's not going to be a loophole.

08:40.840 --> 08:43.605
There's not going to be a trial.
I am not going to have you drag...

08:43.711 --> 08:45.770
this firm's good name
through the mud.

08:45.880 --> 08:50.441
I've talked toJudge Weathers
and he has agreed to suspend your case.

08:50.550 --> 08:54.350
- Under what conditions?
- Probation, suspension of your driver's licence...

08:54.420 --> 08:57.015
and 500 hours
of community service.

08:57.091 --> 08:59.025
And a leave of absence
from the firm.

08:59.093 --> 09:02.392
A leave of absence?
He can't do that.

09:02.463 --> 09:05.795
- He can't stop me from working!
- He's not. I am.

09:05.899 --> 09:09.392
That was my condition.
Gordon, you need a break.

09:09.470 --> 09:13.463
- You're too wrapped up in your work.
- But, sir, my work is my life.

09:13.574 --> 09:18.102
That's just my point.
The community service will do you good.

09:18.212 --> 09:22.204
It'll teach you compassion,
a sense of fair play, how to fit in.

09:22.282 --> 09:26.242
- Community service? This is horrible.
- You'll get used to it.

09:26.320 --> 09:29.483
And hopefully you'll come back
a better person and a better attorney,

09:29.590 --> 09:33.754
which is why I'm keeping you on salary
and have arranged a driver for you.

09:33.827 --> 09:39.094
You know, in the early '7 Os I drove the
tour bus for The Grand Funk Railroad.

09:39.166 --> 09:42.431
Man, that was the life.
Chicks, parties,

09:42.503 --> 09:44.596
amps cranked up to about
eight jillion decibels.

09:44.672 --> 09:48.403
All that loud music damaged my hearing,
but I got no regrets...

09:48.475 --> 09:51.934
- except for the '80s.
- How could he do this to me?

09:52.013 --> 09:55.641
Community service...
coaching hockey!

09:58.852 --> 10:00.945
I found one!
I'm comin' out!

10:01.021 --> 10:03.286
Karp,you finally found
something for once in your life.

10:03.358 --> 10:06.122
Dumpster Dave comes through!

10:06.194 --> 10:10.426
- What do you think?
- Lovely, Karp, it goes with your eyes.

10:10.498 --> 10:14.024
- You gonna take that from him, Karp?
- Remind me to bust you, Averman.

10:14.134 --> 10:16.797
- Thanks, Peter. Thanks very much.
- Did you get it?

10:16.871 --> 10:21.308
- Yeah! Right there!
- Yeah!

10:21.376 --> 10:24.004
Here, Petie. Here, boy.

10:24.112 --> 10:26.512
A little chili
to keep you warm, buddy.

10:26.615 --> 10:32.019
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
- Oh, yeah, look!

10:32.120 --> 10:34.645
I can't believe he ate the can too.

10:34.723 --> 10:37.157
He sniffs.

10:37.225 --> 10:41.059
He sniffs again.
Looking for that perfect place.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.631
He sniffs some more. He stops.

10:43.699 --> 10:46.633
I think this is it!
He's turnin' in a circle.

10:46.701 --> 10:51.161
- He squats! He scores!
- Yes! We did it!

10:51.239 --> 10:55.074
Full load.

10:55.177 --> 10:58.340
Stinks!

10:58.414 --> 11:00.746
Come on, come on, give me the dollar!

11:00.850 --> 11:02.840
- Hurry it up already.
- I'm hurryin', okay?

11:02.917 --> 11:05.511
- Go, go, go, go!
- Yeah! All right! Let's do it!

11:10.926 --> 11:13.724
Oh, come on. Stop!

11:13.829 --> 11:17.492
- Yes!
- Okay! Here we go.

11:21.771 --> 11:25.036
Yeah. There's more inside.

11:25.107 --> 11:27.200
He's takin'off with it.

11:27.276 --> 11:30.177
This guy deserves what he gets.

11:44.694 --> 11:46.594
Oh, guys, he saw us.

12:09.553 --> 12:13.545
Oh, my!

12:20.997 --> 12:22.760
Rink's gotta be
around here someplace.

12:22.833 --> 12:25.597
Just look for a sign
that says " Personal Hell. "

12:25.669 --> 12:29.400
How could he do this to me?
I hate kids. They're barely human.

12:32.943 --> 12:35.241
Come on! Over here!

12:35.312 --> 12:36.973
Keep it down, please!

12:37.080 --> 12:39.913
Hey, come on.
There's no need for this.

12:39.983 --> 12:42.077
Let's talk, come on.
I'm your friend, aren't I?

12:42.153 --> 12:46.350
Come on, Goldberg, at least try to
stop it. I'm tired of chasin' the puck.

12:46.456 --> 12:49.425
Be careful, man.
It almost hit me that time.

12:49.493 --> 12:52.291
Goldberg, you're the goalie.
It's supposed to hit you.

12:52.362 --> 12:54.422
Does that sound stupid
to anyone else?

12:58.669 --> 13:03.332
Good God.
That's the hockey team.

13:03.440 --> 13:08.469
Drive out on the ice.
It'll be all right.

13:15.887 --> 13:18.377
I ain't scared.

13:18.488 --> 13:21.981
- You don't know what you're doin'.
- Shut your face, Karp.

13:22.059 --> 13:24.527
We're gonna get in big trouble.

13:24.629 --> 13:27.496
- I'll take care of it.
- They're drugs, I just know it.

13:37.842 --> 13:41.903
Yo, dude.
You obviously in the wrong hood.

13:42.013 --> 13:46.040
This is my dominion. This is
a drug-free zone, you understand?

13:46.151 --> 13:49.882
We ain't buyin' nothin'.
I'm feelin' generous today.

13:49.988 --> 13:52.820
So I'm gonna let you get your
sorry vanilla bootie outta here...

13:52.890 --> 13:56.883
before we be usin'
your eyeballs as hockey pucks.

13:56.994 --> 14:02.262
Thanks, bro, but I'm not goin' home
'til I take care of business.

14:02.367 --> 14:05.666
He's got a gun.
Stand back.

14:08.506 --> 14:09.996
Whew!

14:10.074 --> 14:12.566
District Five Pee Wee hockey team.

14:12.678 --> 14:15.078
I'm Gordon Bombay.
I'm the new coach.

14:15.180 --> 14:18.240
What a joke!

14:18.350 --> 14:21.080
- Yeah, right.
- Afraid so, dude.

14:21.186 --> 14:25.714
Got the roster right here.
Averman, Dave.

14:25.791 --> 14:29.124
Conway, Charlie.
Hall, Terry.

14:29.228 --> 14:33.392
Here's the long and the short of it.
I hate hockey and I don't like kids.

14:33.465 --> 14:35.763
What's this supposed to be,
a pep talk?

14:35.868 --> 14:39.066
I'm sure this'll be
a real bonding experience.

14:39.138 --> 14:42.072
Maybe one day one of you
will even write a book about it in jail.

14:42.140 --> 14:44.540
- Funny.
- Is there a goalie?

14:44.610 --> 14:46.635
Only for a little while.
I'm movin' back to Philly.

14:46.745 --> 14:48.872
- Thank you for sharing that.
- No problem.

14:48.947 --> 14:52.384
All right, get out on the ice.
Let me see what you can do.

14:52.452 --> 14:55.888
Uh,just so you know.
We really suck.

14:55.955 --> 14:58.446
I'll decide
who sucks around here.

15:02.160 --> 15:05.995
- Get off me.
- They really suck.

15:08.401 --> 15:11.427
The Pete-meister.
Mr. Rabble-rouser.

15:11.504 --> 15:14.598
Passing the puck
over toJesse-roonie, the enforcer.

15:14.674 --> 15:16.971
Ouch!

15:17.075 --> 15:18.976
That hurt!

15:19.078 --> 15:23.742
Oh, it's the Connie-meister,
the velvet hammer.

15:23.816 --> 15:25.750
Hi, coach. I'm Connie.

15:25.818 --> 15:29.310
- Do you play?
- No. So what's our record anyway?

15:29.422 --> 15:32.482
0 and 9. One was pretty close, though.
We only lost by five.

15:32.592 --> 15:35.356
We almost scored a goal too.

15:35.461 --> 15:38.123
So what do we do now... coach?

15:38.197 --> 15:41.098
- What did your old coach have you do?
- He just yelled a lot.

15:41.167 --> 15:44.102
- That's how he hurt his arm.
- His arm?

15:44.170 --> 15:47.698
Yeah, one minute he's yelling at us, "
Little bastards, where'd you learn to play?

15:47.808 --> 15:52.437
Oh, you suck, you!
Skate, you little bast-"

15:52.512 --> 15:54.980
Heart attack. Great.

15:55.048 --> 15:57.608
All right, look.
I gotta make a phone call.

15:57.684 --> 16:00.677
Keep scrimmaging. You, you, you,
you and you against you four.

16:00.788 --> 16:04.019
- We got names, you know?
- I'm sure you do.

16:04.124 --> 16:06.648
And I'll bet they're very nice names.
I might even learn 'em.

16:06.726 --> 16:08.557
For now, I'll be in my office.

16:08.661 --> 16:11.995
Oh, and if you
need anything, fax me.

16:12.066 --> 16:14.193
Geez, what a jerk.

16:14.301 --> 16:17.031
Where do they find these coaches
anyways? We're impressionable kids, right?

16:17.137 --> 16:19.298
Shouldn't we check
his qualifications or somethin'?

16:19.373 --> 16:23.399
Jeannie, who told you
not to give me my messages?

16:23.509 --> 16:27.674
Ducksworth!
Then who's handling my cases?

16:27.748 --> 16:29.739
- On three!
- Jane!

16:29.850 --> 16:31.818
- One, two, three! Charge!
- Are you kidding me?

16:31.885 --> 16:34.649
She's outta law school one year.
She's not qualified to -

16:34.722 --> 16:36.690
Hold on a second!

16:36.757 --> 16:41.694
Hey! Get your mouth off the windows!

16:43.897 --> 16:47.230
- Hey!
- Get off there!

16:47.334 --> 16:50.565
Get off the car!

16:50.672 --> 16:55.268
- We're being invaded!
- Get off!

16:55.377 --> 16:58.504
- Get off the roof, you little monkey.
- Oh, cool!

16:58.579 --> 17:00.877
- Is that a real phone?
- Yes, and I'm really on it.

17:00.948 --> 17:02.916
- Not any more.
- Thank you.

17:03.017 --> 17:06.510
- Let's see, who should I -
- Watch the upholstery.

17:09.891 --> 17:13.791
- Don't touch that.
- We wanna ride!

17:13.894 --> 17:16.521
We wanna ride! We wanna ride!

17:16.597 --> 17:20.432
- We wanna ride!
- I could kill one of'em just to set an example.

17:20.535 --> 17:24.403
Not yet, Lewis.
Take 'em for a spin, anything!

17:31.112 --> 17:34.912
This looks good.
I'm gonna eat it.

17:34.983 --> 17:37.042
- Wow, I feel like Madonna.
- You wish!

17:37.118 --> 17:38.915
Seats ten comfortably.

17:38.987 --> 17:43.390
Hey, pass me one of those glasses.

17:43.459 --> 17:46.622
Yeah, I see your point.

17:46.729 --> 17:48.662
Oh.

17:48.763 --> 17:52.790
Goldberg!

17:52.901 --> 17:55.961
- It wasn't me, all right!
- Young man, what did you eat?

17:56.071 --> 17:58.768
- Nothing! It wasn't me!
- Open a window!

17:58.841 --> 18:02.242
Oh, man! It's my mom!

18:02.311 --> 18:04.505
- She looks pissed.
- Oh, man.

18:06.815 --> 18:09.579
All right, out!
Everybody, out of the car right now.

18:09.651 --> 18:13.850
Goldberg, why'd you
have to ruin the fun?

18:13.956 --> 18:17.153
Are you out of your mind? What were you
thinking putting that car on the ice?

18:17.259 --> 18:19.454
- My son was in that car.
- Lady, lady, relax.

18:19.528 --> 18:22.496
One crack in the ice.
That's all it would take. One crack!

18:22.597 --> 18:24.327
- The ice is not gonna crack.
- Who do you think you are?

18:24.433 --> 18:27.766
- I'm Gordon Bombay, the new hockey coach.
- The new coach?

18:27.837 --> 18:30.465
They send you over here to coach
the team and you endanger their lives.

18:30.539 --> 18:33.599
What danger? I grew up on the ice;
I know when it's safe to drive on.

18:33.676 --> 18:36.339
- How do you know?
- I just know! All right?

18:36.446 --> 18:40.381
Well, listen, Mr. Zen Master, you may be
in tune with the ice universe,

18:40.483 --> 18:43.850
but when it comes to my kid,
"I just know" doesn't cut it.

18:43.953 --> 18:46.945
Charlie, let's go.

18:47.022 --> 18:51.357
- Mom?
- Give me my candy! All of it!

18:51.461 --> 18:55.055
Well, I guess practise is over.

18:55.164 --> 18:58.895
- Sorry my mom ruined it, guys.
- It's all right, Charlie.

18:59.001 --> 19:02.027
Coach, gonna be
at the game tomorrow?

19:02.138 --> 19:05.666
By order of the state
of Minnesota, yeah.

19:05.842 --> 19:10.404
Hawks! Hawks! Hawks!

19:10.514 --> 19:13.414
Hawks! Hawks! Hawks!
Hawks! Hawks! Hawks!

19:13.516 --> 19:16.179
Hawks! Hawks! Hawks!

19:16.253 --> 19:20.485
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!

19:20.557 --> 19:23.890
One, two, three, four, five!

19:31.434 --> 19:34.335
- Hi, girls.
- Karp! No!

19:34.404 --> 19:37.498
Goodbye.

20:00.865 --> 20:05.563
The hawks. My first game
and it had to be the Hawks.

20:06.636 --> 20:09.731
Gordon? Gordon Bombay.

20:09.807 --> 20:12.742
- Coach Reilly.
- We're both adults now.

20:12.810 --> 20:14.801
Why don't you
just call meJack?

20:14.912 --> 20:18.143
Hey, come back
to see your old coach, huh?

20:18.249 --> 20:22.743
Well, actually I'm, uh,
coaching... Pee Wee.

20:22.820 --> 20:28.383
- District Five team.
- No kiddin'. You got a kid on the team or something?

20:28.459 --> 20:32.589
No, I'm here because I need
to be of service to the community.

20:32.663 --> 20:36.327
How about this, huh? Whoever thought
we'd be coachin' against each other?

20:36.434 --> 20:38.994
Yeah, who'd have thought?

20:39.103 --> 20:41.833
So, who's your hotshot
player this year?

20:41.939 --> 20:44.305
- Anyone good?
- I got a kid named Banks.

20:44.408 --> 20:48.106
Might go all the way.
Not quite as good as you were.

20:48.180 --> 20:51.081
But he wants it more.
Kid won't give up.

20:55.319 --> 20:56.980
Oh, boy,

20:59.023 --> 21:02.926
I wish they would
take that one down. Don't you?

21:04.596 --> 21:07.087
Well, good luck.

21:07.165 --> 21:10.258
You're gonna need it.

21:10.334 --> 21:14.772
It's up to you, Gordon.
You miss this shot, you're not just...

21:14.840 --> 21:17.604
letting me down, you're letting
your whole team down too.

21:17.676 --> 21:20.474
I wish your dad
could be here to see this.

21:20.545 --> 21:23.844
Make him proud of you!

21:23.949 --> 21:27.476
Win! Win! Win!

21:29.121 --> 21:32.522
All right, guys, gather round.
Come on, come on.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.491
- Win! Win! Win!
- Win. Win.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.859
Win! Win! Win!

21:38.964 --> 21:42.128
- Win?
- Win! Win! Win!

21:42.201 --> 21:45.499
Yeah, we're fired up.

21:51.576 --> 21:53.339
All right! Watch this!

21:53.412 --> 21:57.349
Oh, great. Good concept, guys.
Nice - ouch!

21:57.417 --> 22:00.318
Nice goin', fool!

22:00.386 --> 22:03.582
- Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
- Oh, yeah, "I didn't mean to. "

22:03.689 --> 22:06.021
Yeah, sure,
you're on my own team.

22:06.091 --> 22:08.526
Oh, sorry, Goldberg.
Didn't mean to.

22:08.594 --> 22:10.755
Would you get off me
before I clock you?

22:10.863 --> 22:15.095
Let's go,Jesse!
Go, Terry!

22:15.201 --> 22:19.034
Let's go! Come on in.

22:19.104 --> 22:21.869
What's this?
The Oreo line!

22:21.941 --> 22:24.205
Hey, come on.
Let's play hockey.

22:24.277 --> 22:26.871
Um, batter, batter,
hum, batter, batter!

22:26.946 --> 22:30.245
Hey, batter, batter,
swing, batter, batter!

22:30.350 --> 22:33.114
- Hum, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
- Averman!

22:33.219 --> 22:36.882
It's hockey!
There's no batter. Idiot.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.288
Hum, goalie, goalie,
hum, goalie, goalie!

22:39.392 --> 22:41.860
Hey, goalie, goalie,
save, goalie, goalie!

22:41.928 --> 22:44.590
Hum, goalie, goalie,
hey, goalie, goalie!

22:55.441 --> 22:58.069
No, I got him!
I, I, I got him!

23:06.620 --> 23:09.486
That's one!

23:09.589 --> 23:11.557
Hey, hey, hey! Easy!

23:11.624 --> 23:14.822
Good show. Sloppy pass.

23:14.928 --> 23:18.159
Way to stuff it, Banks!

23:20.401 --> 23:23.598
All right, all right! Let's run it up!
Run it up! Run it up!

23:32.246 --> 23:34.612
Oh, man! How could you
let him get by you?

23:36.250 --> 23:38.980
All right, line change.
Come on, go, go, go.

23:43.690 --> 23:47.990
Hey!

23:52.834 --> 23:55.701
Banks! Banks! Banks!

23:58.373 --> 24:00.806
Hey, you!
Come back here! Oh!

24:00.874 --> 24:03.365
Why me?

24:06.047 --> 24:09.983
How lazy can you be?
They're killing us out there!

24:10.051 --> 24:13.316
How many times do I have to tell you:
Get those rebounds,

24:13.388 --> 24:16.288
get your heads up,
get those loose pucks.

24:16.356 --> 24:18.324
Get - Just -

24:18.392 --> 24:21.191
Just get the hell outta here.

24:25.567 --> 24:28.627
All right!

24:28.703 --> 24:30.967
It's Spaz-way. He'll screw up.

24:42.984 --> 24:46.648
Hey, hey! Way to play it, Banks!
All right!

24:46.722 --> 24:50.487
That's okay, Charlie!
Nice try!

24:50.558 --> 24:53.550
Nice fan, Charlie. Keep swingin'.
Maybe you'll give 'em a cold.

24:53.661 --> 24:55.856
Hey, hey, hey,
knock it off!

24:55.930 --> 24:59.662
Against this team we should have
twice this many! Now let's run it up!

24:59.735 --> 25:04.331
Remember it's not worth winning
if you can't win big!

25:04.406 --> 25:06.374
All right!

25:08.943 --> 25:11.503
Guys! No! Come on,
let's talk about this!

25:11.580 --> 25:14.048
Be civilized!
Come on! Please!

25:20.089 --> 25:22.421
Oh no, guys!
Come on, not again! Please!

25:22.525 --> 25:26.689
Just take the goal.
Fine! I don't care!

25:26.762 --> 25:29.595
- I'm so embarrassed.
- We need a new goalie.

25:33.969 --> 25:35.903
All right!
Hey, knock it off!

25:35.971 --> 25:38.770
That was a lousy third period.
Anybody could beat these pansies.

25:38.875 --> 25:42.935
I want you guys
to stay hungry out there!

25:43.045 --> 25:45.912
All right, nice goin', Banks.
New Hawks record.

25:45.981 --> 25:48.916
- Okay, boys. Let's go.
- All right!

25:48.984 --> 25:51.715
Hey, Gordon! Nice game.

25:52.722 --> 25:54.781
I enjoyed it thoroughly.

25:55.992 --> 25:59.085
At least I can handle the puck!

26:01.297 --> 26:05.291
Hey, shut up!
You guys stink!

26:05.402 --> 26:07.495
I thought we came
here to play hockey.

26:07.604 --> 26:10.471
You know, I knew we forgot something.

26:10.574 --> 26:13.407
Oh, you think it's funny?
You think losing is funny?

26:13.476 --> 26:15.943
Well, not at first,
but once you get the hang of it.

26:16.011 --> 26:18.105
We're the ones out there
gettin' our butts kicked.

26:18.181 --> 26:21.639
Yeah, it's not like you coach us
or anything. At least we try.

26:21.751 --> 26:23.742
You didn't listen
to a word I said.

26:23.820 --> 26:25.788
I said, keep your heads up.
You put your heads down.

26:25.855 --> 26:27.789
I said, hustle.
You went slower!

26:27.857 --> 26:30.417
That was the sloppiest
playing I've ever seen.

26:30.493 --> 26:34.156
Why the hell don't you
just listen to me?

26:34.264 --> 26:38.132
Why the hell should we?

26:38.201 --> 26:41.500
I don't care.

26:41.605 --> 26:45.872
You want to lose, fine. You're the ones
who look like idiots out there.

26:52.782 --> 26:55.615
Great game!

26:55.685 --> 26:57.654
Hans?

27:11.235 --> 27:13.362
I don't believe it!
Who would throw these away?

27:13.471 --> 27:17.373
- First look's free, next five minutes costs a buck each.
- Fork it over.

27:17.475 --> 27:20.569
Forget it, Karp.
I can see this every day on MTV.

27:20.678 --> 27:25.138
This one's from Minneapolis.
Hey, Guy, look, it's your mom.

27:27.551 --> 27:29.712
- Let's give him a wedgie.
- Good idea,Jesse!

27:29.820 --> 27:32.812
I was just kidding, okay?

27:32.890 --> 27:35.256
Hey! Give that back!

27:36.862 --> 27:40.854
- Hi, girls.
- Does your mommy know you have that?

27:40.931 --> 27:43.593
Nah, she's busy with the mailman.

27:43.701 --> 27:45.191
That'll make great bathroom reading.

27:45.269 --> 27:47.237
That's mine, you jerk!
I found it!

27:47.338 --> 27:49.238
You don't even know
what to do with it, wuss-breath.

27:49.340 --> 27:52.868
- You gonna let him call
you wuss-breath? - No!

27:52.944 --> 27:55.776
Hey! Hey!

27:55.880 --> 27:59.714
- Oh!
- Come on. Want some more?

27:59.784 --> 28:03.881
You guys want some more?
Come on!

28:03.955 --> 28:05.889
Yeah! You want some more?
Come on!

28:17.936 --> 28:20.404
Let's get out!
Move it!

28:20.472 --> 28:22.702
- Thanks a lot.
- All right, man.

28:24.710 --> 28:28.874
One, two, three! Boom!

28:30.449 --> 28:32.917
What are you laughing at,
cream cheese boy? Go!

28:32.984 --> 28:36.442
If we're gonna cheat,
we gotta make those falls look real.

28:36.555 --> 28:40.548
Keep it up! Whoa!
Score one for the spirit.

28:42.495 --> 28:45.123
Go at him! Go at him!
Good! Go at him!

28:45.231 --> 28:48.131
Come on, get angry! Oh!

28:48.233 --> 28:50.497
Come on, make it look real.
Act hurt!

28:50.602 --> 28:52.661
I am hurt.

28:52.771 --> 28:55.137
Good, good.
Now say it again!

28:55.240 --> 28:58.733
Take the fall!
Act hurt! Get indignant!

28:58.811 --> 29:03.611
- One more time!
- Take the fall! Act hurt! Get indignant!

29:03.682 --> 29:07.448
Good! You guys are ready.

29:12.358 --> 29:16.294
Give me a break, ref! Open your eyes!
Did you see what he did to me?

29:16.362 --> 29:20.923
Goldberg, you don't take the fall
while they're shooting at you.

29:20.999 --> 29:23.798
Oh! Well, I guess you didn't
explain that very well, did ya?

29:23.870 --> 29:26.498
- District Five!
- I throw myself on the ice -

29:26.606 --> 29:30.474
Cut the acting class.
One more dive, I forfeit to theJets!

29:30.543 --> 29:33.376
What? I'm insulted by that!

29:36.817 --> 29:39.683
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Quit it!

29:49.296 --> 29:51.958
Face-off! Let's go!

29:52.032 --> 29:54.829
Charlie!

30:01.007 --> 30:04.500
That guy is twice your size. The next
time he gets you in a corner like that,

30:04.578 --> 30:07.809
I want you to grab your eye
like it's cut and then hit the ice!

30:07.881 --> 30:12.715
- Got it? Let's go.
- Let's go! Face-off!

30:12.819 --> 30:15.050
Okay, even 'em up, boys.
Here we go.

30:16.423 --> 30:18.482
Hey -

30:22.162 --> 30:24.357
- Come on!
- That's it, Charlie.

30:26.834 --> 30:29.394
- That's it, Charlie!
- Come on!

30:32.606 --> 30:34.506
Damn it, Charlie!

30:34.575 --> 30:37.942
We can't even win when we cheat.

30:38.045 --> 30:41.379
- Stupid cake-eater tricks!
- That was embarrassing.

30:41.449 --> 30:45.714
Charlie! What the hell
is the matter with you?

30:45.786 --> 30:48.220
When I tell you to do something,
you do it! You got it?

30:49.957 --> 30:52.687
Look at me.

30:52.759 --> 30:56.890
- You got it?
- You can't make me cheat.

31:00.068 --> 31:04.731
Jesse, Terry, let's go.

31:04.805 --> 31:07.239
This is what I gave up
my overtime pay for?

31:07.307 --> 31:10.277
To see my kids takin' falls?

31:54.255 --> 31:56.815
Gordon.

31:56.925 --> 32:00.293
- How did you know?
- Through the back door at this time of night.

32:00.362 --> 32:03.695
Just like you used to.

32:03.799 --> 32:06.359
You'd spend hours
watching me do this.

32:06.468 --> 32:08.663
What do you think?

32:08.771 --> 32:10.670
Is this sharp enough? Ow!

32:10.772 --> 32:14.368
- Did you cut yourself?
- No.

32:14.476 --> 32:16.808
You always fell for that.

32:16.879 --> 32:20.337
- God, you're morbid, Hans.
- No, I'm Scandinavian.

32:20.449 --> 32:24.010
- It's nice to see you.
- Sure, sure, sure.

32:24.119 --> 32:27.111
You probably thought
I was dead.

32:27.189 --> 32:30.317
I saw you at the game the other night.
Why didn't you say anything?

32:30.392 --> 32:33.850
You were so busy
screaming at the kids.

32:33.963 --> 32:36.363
I didn't want
to spoil the moment.

32:46.675 --> 32:51.669
- Everything's the same.
- Well, the game hasn't changed.

32:51.747 --> 32:54.512
Why should my store?

32:54.584 --> 32:56.848
- Heard you became a doctor.
- Lawyer.

32:56.920 --> 32:59.854
Oh, that's too bad.
Enjoy that?

32:59.922 --> 33:02.584
Well, I hardly
ever lose a case.

33:02.691 --> 33:06.059
That is not what I asked.

33:06.162 --> 33:09.063
Hmm! I see you still have this up.

33:09.165 --> 33:12.896
- Thanks very much.
- It is important to remember the past.

33:13.003 --> 33:15.563
I'd just as soon forget it.

33:15.672 --> 33:20.439
That was the worse time in my life.
My dad died that year.

33:20.543 --> 33:24.843
- The two are not related.
- No, but it felt like they were.

33:24.881 --> 33:28.749
I found this not long ago.

33:30.854 --> 33:33.016
He was proud of you.

33:33.090 --> 33:35.353
I miss him.

33:40.897 --> 33:44.765
You scored 198 goals
in that season, Gordon.

33:44.868 --> 33:47.235
It's a shame you quit. You -

33:47.304 --> 33:51.034
- Could have gone all the way. Yeah.
- No!

33:51.107 --> 33:54.201
You really loved to play.

33:54.277 --> 33:58.714
You remember? You remember...

33:58.783 --> 34:01.377
you used to play on the ponds
until after dark,

34:01.452 --> 34:04.319
until your father
called you back.

34:04.422 --> 34:06.890
You really flew
on that ice, Gordon.

34:06.957 --> 34:09.550
That's all I ever wanted to do.

34:09.626 --> 34:14.155
Then why did you stop? Reilly?

34:14.264 --> 34:18.292
I saw what he did to you.
Reilly is an idiot.

34:18.402 --> 34:22.429
- The guy wins.
- It's not about winning. It never was.

34:22.505 --> 34:27.909
Just show they how to play. Show them
how to have fun. Teach them to fly.

34:27.978 --> 34:32.938
That is what they'll remember long after
you've gone back to being a doctor.

34:33.016 --> 34:35.417
Lawyer.

34:35.518 --> 34:38.956
And long after they've stopped
buying skates from me.

34:39.024 --> 34:42.458
Here... there you are.

34:42.525 --> 34:44.824
Sharpened, laced, ready to go.

34:44.929 --> 34:47.762
- What's this?
- Your new skates.

34:47.831 --> 34:50.824
That is why you came here
tonight, isn't it?

34:50.935 --> 34:56.203
- I figured nine and a half was your size.
- Actually, I'm a nine.

34:56.308 --> 35:01.108
Wear thick socks, Gordon.
Enjoy them.

36:02.375 --> 36:04.366
Here comes Bombay
on an end-to-end rush.

36:04.443 --> 36:07.934
Past the blue line, past centre.
He's not skating, he's flying!

36:08.046 --> 36:10.344
He fakes once,
he fakes twice.

36:10.415 --> 36:13.874
Fakes three times!
Shoots! Scores! Yes!

36:13.953 --> 36:17.252
Yes! Yes! Yes!
What a play!

36:17.356 --> 36:19.790
What a guy!
Gordon Bombay does it again!

36:19.892 --> 36:24.625
Great move, Gordy!
You faked him out of his pads.

36:24.730 --> 36:27.198
Come here, son.

36:27.266 --> 36:31.464
You look great out there. Come on,
let's go inside, get something to eat.

36:31.571 --> 36:34.870
A few more minutes?

36:34.941 --> 36:37.706
Please?

36:37.778 --> 36:40.041
- Go on. Get outta here.
- Thanks.

37:16.950 --> 37:19.316
- Hi, uh - - Please,just go
away. Charlie doesn't want...

37:19.419 --> 37:22.354
to be on the team any more, and neither
he nor I have anything to say to you.

37:22.456 --> 37:25.084
- Well, I have something to say to you.
- Oh, really?

37:25.158 --> 37:27.285
Door-to-door mistreatment now.

37:27.361 --> 37:29.921
Now the team can feel miserable
between games too, huh?

37:30.030 --> 37:35.161
I came to apologize to Charlie...
to both of you.

37:35.269 --> 37:39.171
- What?
- Apologize.

37:39.273 --> 37:43.210
Well... you should.

37:44.512 --> 37:48.948
Charlie.
Somebody's here to see you.

37:51.351 --> 37:53.319
Hey, Charlie, how ya doin'?

37:55.188 --> 37:59.148
I was just, uh, walkin'
around thinkin' and, uh -

38:01.863 --> 38:05.161
Wanna give us a minute?

38:05.232 --> 38:08.998
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

38:15.243 --> 38:18.644
Listen, it was
very wrong of me...

38:18.713 --> 38:20.907
to ask you and
the other guys to cheat.

38:21.014 --> 38:24.746
I never should have said to you what I
said to you. I was angry. I was frustrated.

38:24.852 --> 38:29.312
It took a lot of guts for you to do
what you knew was right. I admire that.

38:29.390 --> 38:34.327
And, uh, I just wanted
to tell you that, uh,

38:34.395 --> 38:37.194
that I'm -

38:37.266 --> 38:39.859
Oh, boy, this is difficult.

38:39.934 --> 38:42.198
- I'm -
- You're sorry.

38:42.270 --> 38:46.229
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. All right?

38:46.341 --> 38:51.439
Tell your mom that hopefully it'll be
a lot more fun this time around.

38:51.547 --> 38:53.845
What do you say?

38:53.916 --> 38:56.907
Do you want to stay for dinner?

38:57.018 --> 38:59.782
- What?
- Charlie!

38:59.887 --> 39:03.847
Uh, no, I -
I can't. Uh -

39:05.361 --> 39:09.695
Well, what are you havin'?

39:12.233 --> 39:15.635
Mr. Ducksworth,
there are two reasons I came by.

39:15.738 --> 39:18.298
First off, I want to let
you know things are going well.

39:18.407 --> 39:21.433
I'm learning a lot about teamwork,
fair play and all that junk.

39:21.543 --> 39:24.740
Good, good.
And the second thing?

39:24.813 --> 39:27.611
Well, sir,
fair play doesn't come cheap.

39:27.716 --> 39:30.276
These kids, my team,
have no money.

39:30.386 --> 39:33.753
They can't afford rink time,
safe equipment, proper uniforms,

39:33.822 --> 39:35.949
which makes it difficult
for them to compete.

39:36.058 --> 39:40.495
Now imagine, sir, being ten years old
and stepping out onto that ice...

39:40.596 --> 39:44.556
with old copies of the " Enquirer"
taped to your shins instead of pads.

39:44.634 --> 39:46.567
The point I'm trying to make, sir,

39:46.635 --> 39:49.399
is that you wouldn't be taken seriously
and neither are these kids.

39:49.471 --> 39:53.305
So I thought maybe
the firm could help 'em out.

39:53.409 --> 39:55.105
How much are we talking about?

39:55.178 --> 39:58.477
- $15,000.
- No way.

39:58.581 --> 40:02.949
Wait a minute. Think of the goodwill.
We name the team after the firm.

40:03.018 --> 40:07.455
Suddenly, we're the good guys.
Ducksworth, Saver and Gross,

40:07.523 --> 40:11.756
the firm that gives back
to the community.

40:11.828 --> 40:14.160
Come on.
I'll get you your own jersey.

40:17.600 --> 40:19.863
~ Ooo,yeah ~

40:19.968 --> 40:23.302
~ Can you feel it baby
Ooo ~

40:23.373 --> 40:27.173
~I can too, Ooo ~

40:29.379 --> 40:31.779
~ Ooo ~

40:33.650 --> 40:36.517
~ Ooo, come on swing ~

40:36.619 --> 40:38.553
~ Come on swing ~

40:38.655 --> 40:40.680
~ Come on swing ~

40:40.790 --> 40:42.883
~ C-Come on swing
Ooo ~

40:45.061 --> 40:46.995
~ Ooo ~

40:49.133 --> 40:52.499
~It's such a good vibration ~

40:52.569 --> 40:57.063
~It's such a sweet sensation ~

40:57.173 --> 41:00.974
~It's such a good vibration ~

41:01.045 --> 41:04.037
~It's such a sweet sensation ~

41:04.148 --> 41:06.378
Who is that kid?

41:06.484 --> 41:08.384
Thanks, Fulton.

41:08.486 --> 41:10.919
- Fulton Reed. He's in one of my classes.
- How come he's not on the team?

41:11.020 --> 41:13.819
He only plays football. Some preppie
school gave him a scholarship...

41:13.891 --> 41:15.859
as long as he doesn't play hockey.

41:15.926 --> 41:17.860
- They don't want him gettin' hurt.
- I heard it was colleges.

41:17.928 --> 41:20.021
He's been accepted to four of'em.

41:20.097 --> 41:23.863
- Yeah, but I heard he's got to repeat the sixth grade.
- Ah, shut up.

41:23.934 --> 41:27.665
Gordon Bombay?

41:27.738 --> 41:30.172
Bombay was a Hawk.

41:30.241 --> 41:32.573
~... Good vibration ~

41:32.676 --> 41:36.077
~It's such a sweet sensation ~

41:36.180 --> 41:40.174
~Feel the vibration
It's such a good vibration ~~

41:41.586 --> 41:43.883
Dude, check 'em out, man.

41:43.954 --> 41:45.888
Holy cow.

41:45.956 --> 41:49.357
- They're pretty good skaters.
- Anybody know who they are?

41:49.426 --> 41:53.864
That's Tommy Duncan. He's in my science
class. That's his sister, Tammy.

41:53.932 --> 41:56.901
- Think they'd want to play hockey with us?
- Yeah!

41:56.968 --> 42:01.427
Go get dressed.
I'll do the negotiating.

42:03.107 --> 42:06.600
Just think of it
as figure skating... with a stick.

42:06.711 --> 42:10.078
You're gonna love it, Tammy.
Hey, atta boy, Tommy!

42:10.148 --> 42:13.811
Lookin' good, lookin' tough.
Give me five, show me you're alive!

42:13.919 --> 42:16.251
Mom isn't gonna
like this at all.

42:16.321 --> 42:19.380
So what? You want me to figure skate,
then you gotta play hockey.

42:19.456 --> 42:22.449
What do I know about hockey?

42:22.561 --> 42:25.052
More than you think.

42:25.130 --> 42:29.089
Back to basics! Skating!

42:29.167 --> 42:33.831
Go! Go! Side to side.
Shift your weight.

42:33.939 --> 42:37.966
Get comfortable on your edges.
That's good, that's good.

42:38.076 --> 42:40.601
Keep your balance, Karp.
Trust your edges.

42:40.679 --> 42:43.648
That's okay, Charlie.

42:46.519 --> 42:49.079
Soft hands.

42:49.155 --> 42:53.955
You don't shoot the puck
to your teammate. You sail it to him.

42:54.025 --> 42:56.653
Karp, on your feet.

42:56.761 --> 43:01.961
- You send it.
- Oh! Gross!

43:02.034 --> 43:06.027
You don't stop the pass.
You accept it. Cradle it.

43:07.139 --> 43:09.197
- Oh!
- Again!

43:09.307 --> 43:11.502
Concentration, not strength.

43:11.610 --> 43:15.103
Like the Karate Kid, right?
"Wax on! Wax off!"

43:15.181 --> 43:17.945
Just shut up and try it, Averman!

43:18.017 --> 43:20.645
- You're such a jerk.
- Send it back, Averman.

43:20.720 --> 43:23.120
Good, Averman. Charlie.

43:25.123 --> 43:27.456
That's good. Good.
Now sail it back.

43:27.526 --> 43:31.860
Oh! Way to go!

43:31.964 --> 43:35.491
Good, good.
Good, cradle it.

43:35.568 --> 43:37.900
Cradle it.
Soft hands, soft hands.

43:38.004 --> 43:40.303
Oh!

43:40.374 --> 43:42.637
Here it comes.
Nice and easy. Good.

43:42.708 --> 43:47.577
- I did it! I did it!
- All right.

43:47.680 --> 43:50.240
Nice drill, coach.
Really very cute.

43:50.349 --> 43:54.548
- But when are you gonna work with me in goal?
- Goldberg, do you trust me?

43:54.655 --> 43:58.681
My mother would not approve of this, coach.
She'd like me to live to be bar mitzvah'd.

43:58.758 --> 44:02.524
This is your bar mitzvah, Goldberg.
Today you will become a man.

44:02.595 --> 44:05.861
Coach, I think you got the ceremonies
mixed up. It's more like a circumcision.

44:05.932 --> 44:08.992
Coach! Will you come back here?
What'd I ever do to you, man?

44:09.069 --> 44:12.664
District Five! Ready!

44:12.739 --> 44:15.366
Oh, man, I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.

44:15.441 --> 44:18.035
- Aim!
- Nice knowin' ya, Goldie.

44:18.110 --> 44:20.238
- Oh, please! No!
- Fire!

44:24.918 --> 44:28.012
I wanna go home!

44:33.760 --> 44:36.058
This doesn't hurt!

44:36.129 --> 44:38.529
You wimps!
Give me your best shot!

44:38.598 --> 44:41.089
Oh! Come on!
That's good!

44:41.201 --> 44:44.797
Hex goal! Goalie boot save!
Whoa! Nice shot, man!

44:44.906 --> 44:47.773
I'm a dog! I'm a crazed dog!
Come on!

44:47.875 --> 44:52.277
Goldberg! Goldberg!

44:52.379 --> 44:56.281
I am Goldberg!
The goalie!

44:58.219 --> 45:01.655
Good! Good!
All right, Charlie!

45:01.756 --> 45:04.657
Good hustle! Conway, way to go.
All right, Karp!

45:04.759 --> 45:06.885
- You guys hungry? Tired?
- Yeah!

45:06.960 --> 45:10.760
- Do you ache? Are you pumped up?
- Yeah!

45:10.831 --> 45:15.098
Good! That was a hell of a practise.
Be proud of yourself.

45:18.072 --> 45:22.270
Hey, guys! Excuse me, guys!
You gotta untie me now!

45:22.343 --> 45:26.109
Ha-ha! Good joke.
Very funny. I like it.

45:26.180 --> 45:29.172
No joke, come on, guys.
Hey, coach!

45:29.283 --> 45:31.774
Coach, come on, don't leave me
hangin' like this!

45:31.853 --> 45:34.117
Coach, don't make me
come after you, coach.

45:48.169 --> 45:51.799
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Thanks for the ride.

45:51.874 --> 45:54.934
You did real well in
practise today, Charlie.

45:55.010 --> 45:58.137
Let me ask you something.
What happened to your dad?

46:00.214 --> 46:05.778
Mom and I left him. I don't really
remember, but that's what she says.

46:05.854 --> 46:09.688
You know, when I was a boy,
I had to take care of my mother too.

46:09.792 --> 46:12.022
Really?
What happened to your dad?

46:12.127 --> 46:15.527
He passed away.

46:17.166 --> 46:20.966
You do a good job
takin' care of your mom.

46:21.036 --> 46:23.129
- Thanks.
- Keep it up, all right?

46:23.205 --> 46:26.834
- Okay. We'll see ya.
- Okay. Hey, coach.

46:26.909 --> 46:29.139
- What's that?
- Huh?

46:29.211 --> 46:31.304
- Oh!
- Victory!

46:31.380 --> 46:35.373
You've just entered the tickling zone!

46:41.723 --> 46:44.693
So I'm right in the middle of my
cross-examination and I say to the guy,

46:44.761 --> 46:48.526
I usually defend heels like you,
you scuzzy, mole-faced rat.

46:48.597 --> 46:50.861
That's a good one, sir.

46:50.933 --> 46:52.867
Whoa!

47:00.777 --> 47:04.837
Hey! Hey! Hold it!

47:06.281 --> 47:10.184
Hold it!

47:10.253 --> 47:12.915
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

47:13.022 --> 47:15.217
Look, it was an accident,
all right?

47:15.291 --> 47:17.885
Never mind the window.
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?

47:17.961 --> 47:20.054
I didn't learn.
I just do it.

47:20.129 --> 47:22.392
Do it again.

47:33.142 --> 47:35.201
Yargh!

47:38.147 --> 47:41.583
Well, you're great at breaking windows.
Do you ever hit the goal?

47:41.651 --> 47:44.950
Yeah. Well, one out of five.

47:45.054 --> 47:48.319
Fulton, is it true what they say?

47:48.424 --> 47:50.586
About the scholarships and how
they won't let you play hockey?

47:50.661 --> 47:52.754
People talk.
It don't mean nothin'.

47:52.830 --> 47:55.457
- Why don't you play for us?
- I can't.

47:55.565 --> 47:57.965
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I can't.

47:58.067 --> 48:02.402
- You afraid?
- No, I mean I can't, you moron. I don't know how to skate.

48:05.609 --> 48:08.271
Whoa!

48:08.345 --> 48:10.313
Is that all that's stoppin' ya?

48:20.691 --> 48:23.660
~I ride the top of the line
I can't settle for less ~

48:23.761 --> 48:25.752
Push, Fulton, push.
Keep your knees bent.

48:25.829 --> 48:28.457
Side to side, good!
Follow me.

48:34.171 --> 48:37.004
Aaah!

48:38.108 --> 48:40.372
Watch it!
Get out of the way!

48:42.714 --> 48:45.012
Sorry!

48:45.116 --> 48:47.310
~ This is all we got baby
It's got to be enough ~

48:47.384 --> 48:49.648
~I'd like to try to quit
But I don't know how ~

48:49.720 --> 48:53.554
~I needed it then and baby
I need it right now ~

48:53.657 --> 48:55.819
Come on, Fulton.
Let's go!

48:55.894 --> 48:58.829
- ~I gotta keep movin' 'til I'm satisfied ~
- Hey!

48:58.897 --> 49:02.627
~ Come on, Come on
It's gonna be all right ~~

49:05.402 --> 49:08.497
The Ducks?
We're the Ducks?

49:08.573 --> 49:11.041
Man, what brain-dead jerk
came up with that name?

49:11.142 --> 49:16.205
As a matter of fact, I did. But I didn't
have a choice. We're being sponsored.

49:16.314 --> 49:19.805
By who? Donald and Daisy?

49:19.883 --> 49:23.581
Hey, you don't wanna be Ducks? You'd
rather be District Five? Some stupid number?

49:23.688 --> 49:26.851
Better than some stupid animal.

49:26.925 --> 49:31.191
I'll have you know, Peter,
that the Duck is one of the most noble,

49:31.262 --> 49:33.890
agile and intelligent creatures
of the animal kingdom.

49:33.999 --> 49:36.559
- But they're wimpy.
- They don't even have teeth.

49:36.668 --> 49:39.603
Neither do hockey players.

49:39.704 --> 49:42.901
Have you guys ever seen a flock
of ducks flying in perfect formation?

49:43.008 --> 49:47.342
It's beautiful. Pretty awesome
the way they all stick together.

49:47.412 --> 49:50.678
Ducks never say die.
Ever seen a duck fight?

49:50.750 --> 49:55.379
No way. Why?
Because the other animals are afraid.

49:55.453 --> 49:58.513
They know that
if they mess with one duck,

49:58.590 --> 50:02.049
they gotta deal
with the whole flock.

50:04.096 --> 50:06.291
Oh, man!

50:06.399 --> 50:08.424
I'm proud to be a duck.

50:08.534 --> 50:11.900
And I'd be proud to fly
with any one of you.

50:11.970 --> 50:14.531
So how about it?
Who's a Duck?

50:19.879 --> 50:24.578
I'll be a Duck.

50:24.650 --> 50:28.950
Yeah. Me too.

50:34.827 --> 50:38.058
Anybody see Goldberg?
All right!

50:40.934 --> 50:44.494
Now we're the Ducks!

50:44.603 --> 50:47.128
The Mighty Ducks!

50:47.239 --> 50:49.434
- What are we?
- The Ducks!

50:55.515 --> 50:57.608
What the hell are they doing?

50:59.753 --> 51:03.017
Every time you get the puck,
you're the quarterback.

51:03.122 --> 51:06.853
Make eye contact with the receiver.
Talk to him, let him know it's comin'.

51:06.960 --> 51:10.657
Come on, guys. This isn't a library.
Talk to each other.

51:10.764 --> 51:12.994
What a weird-ass team.

51:13.100 --> 51:15.261
How you doin'?

51:15.335 --> 51:17.303
- You ready?
- I think so.

51:19.772 --> 51:22.298
Okay, Fulton.
Shoot your heart out.

51:31.551 --> 51:33.952
My God!

51:44.397 --> 51:46.491
Wow!

51:54.141 --> 51:56.974
One out of five.

51:59.714 --> 52:03.013
All right,
Let's forget the past.

52:03.084 --> 52:06.747
We lost a few games, tough!
That was District Five.

52:06.854 --> 52:09.378
- Now we're the Ducks.
- Yeah.

52:09.489 --> 52:13.824
- And the Ducks... are undefeated.
- All right! Yeah!

52:13.895 --> 52:16.227
Quack, quack.

52:16.330 --> 52:19.356
- Quack. Quack.
- Quack! Quack!

52:19.433 --> 52:22.869
Quack! Quack!
Quack! Quack!

52:22.937 --> 52:26.668
Quack! Quack!

52:26.741 --> 52:29.767
Go... Ducks!

52:29.877 --> 52:32.368
What the hell was that?

52:36.350 --> 52:39.218
Let's go, Ducks! Defence! Defence!

52:44.192 --> 52:46.592
Dig it outta there!

52:46.694 --> 52:51.063
Let's go! Let's go! Yeah!

52:51.132 --> 52:54.864
Let's go, Ducks!

52:54.937 --> 52:57.735
Throw it! Throw it!
To the crease!

53:08.951 --> 53:12.409
Yes! The Oreo line!

53:12.487 --> 53:15.320
That's my boy!

53:22.297 --> 53:25.425
Defence, Karp!
Defence! Come on.

53:39.181 --> 53:42.275
I don't wanna go
to school today, Mom.

53:42.351 --> 53:44.512
- How many fingers am I holdin' up?
- He wouldn't know.

53:44.620 --> 53:47.146
Shut up, Peter.
Karp, are you okay?

53:47.257 --> 53:51.818
- Look at this. - The Karp-ster
used his head to stop the puck.

53:51.927 --> 53:55.761
Let's get you off the ice.
Come on.

53:58.968 --> 54:03.200
Get him on the bench, Charlie.

54:05.208 --> 54:07.767
Okay, Ducks,
we still got a chance here.

54:07.843 --> 54:10.778
Connie, Terry,Jesse, Guy,
time for the secret weapon.

54:10.846 --> 54:14.647
Okay, Fulton.
Remember,just like we talked about.

54:15.985 --> 54:17.953
Come on, guys.
Let's do it.

54:24.994 --> 54:27.656
Oh, no.

54:27.730 --> 54:31.188
- Go! Get the face-off!
- Line up, boys, let's go.

54:36.239 --> 54:38.731
That's it.

54:38.842 --> 54:40.741
Aaah!

54:40.843 --> 54:43.403
Whoa!

54:56.260 --> 54:58.750
Whoo! Yeah!

55:09.673 --> 55:12.665
That tie of yours might be what you need
to make the play-offs.

55:12.743 --> 55:14.835
- The ducks have a shot
at the play-offs? - Sure.

55:14.911 --> 55:18.279
Everyone but the last two teams
are in, remember?

55:18.382 --> 55:21.351
Panthers got the measles
and they forfeited the season.

55:21.418 --> 55:24.945
So,you beat the Huskies
and you'll make the play-offs.

55:25.055 --> 55:28.513
- Well, we might have to play the Hawks.
- So?

55:28.592 --> 55:31.618
So they're a tough team.
Nothing's changed since I played.

55:31.729 --> 55:33.720
Actually, one little thing
has changed.

55:33.797 --> 55:36.698
You wouldn't even be a Hawk now.

55:36.767 --> 55:41.295
They redrew the district
lines last year.

55:41.405 --> 55:43.738
The lake is not
the boundary any more.

55:43.808 --> 55:46.800
You see? You'd be a Duck.

55:46.911 --> 55:50.869
I'd be a Duck.

55:53.384 --> 55:55.375
Excuse me. Coach Reilly?

55:55.452 --> 55:57.387
- Yeah?
- I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem.

55:57.455 --> 56:00.583
- What's that?
- One of your players is ineligible.

56:00.658 --> 56:04.287
Banks! Over here!

56:04.396 --> 56:06.386
- This is a joke, right?
- I'm afraid it's no joke.

56:06.463 --> 56:09.489
- Problem?
- No,just a mistake.

56:09.600 --> 56:14.265
Are you this boy's father? 450 North
Hennipen, is that your address?

56:14.339 --> 56:16.398
- Yes.
- I'm afraid there's no mistake.

56:16.474 --> 56:19.739
- This boy is playing for the wrong team.
- What?

56:19.811 --> 56:22.574
According to league rules, Adam Banks
should be playing for District Five.

56:22.646 --> 56:28.017
- My son is a Hawk, not a Duck.
- Is this your doing, Gordon?

56:28.119 --> 56:30.519
I'll expect to see him
at our next game.

56:30.622 --> 56:33.420
- We'll have a uniform waiting for you.
- No way.

56:33.491 --> 56:36.984
My son would rather not play
than play for your team.

56:37.096 --> 56:39.256
Fine, if that's the way
you want it. But remember,

56:39.330 --> 56:43.289
if Adam plays for the Hawks, you'll forfeit
every game for the rest of the season.

56:43.368 --> 56:46.531
Boy, I'd hate to see that.

56:46.638 --> 56:50.541
Look, I'm sorry this had to happen,
but you can see on the map.

56:52.678 --> 56:55.510
Gordon? Hey, Bombay!

56:55.613 --> 56:58.844
You stop when
I'm talking to you, son!

56:58.950 --> 57:01.441
What's the idea here?
You trying to sabotage me or what?

57:01.519 --> 57:04.512
The law's a bitch when it
works against you, isn't it,Jack?

57:04.623 --> 57:07.057
You got a whole team of Banks's.
One kid isn't gonna make a difference.

57:07.159 --> 57:11.220
Even with Banks, what do you think you're
gonna prove, you and that bunch of losers?

57:11.330 --> 57:13.627
That's right, coach.
They are losers.

57:13.698 --> 57:17.465
We hate losers, don't we?
They don't even deserve to live.

57:17.536 --> 57:22.997
Maybe Banks won't make a difference,
but at least we're playing by the rules.

57:23.075 --> 57:27.739
Why'd you turn against me,
Gordon? For six years...

57:27.847 --> 57:30.645
I taught ya how to skate,
I taught ya how to score.

57:30.716 --> 57:32.980
I taught ya how
to go for the "W."

57:33.052 --> 57:35.680
You could have been
one of the greats.

57:35.754 --> 57:38.655
And now look at yourself.

57:38.724 --> 57:42.559
You're not even a has-been.
You're a never-was.

57:50.870 --> 57:54.931
Going to the play-offs! Whoo!

57:55.040 --> 57:58.408
One win!

57:58.512 --> 58:02.278
Hey, why aren't you guys in uniform?
We got warm-ups in half an hour.

58:02.382 --> 58:06.875
All right, everyone, listen up.
I got some good news.

58:06.952 --> 58:09.421
We're getting a new player,
Adam Banks.

58:09.523 --> 58:12.083
What?

58:12.192 --> 58:14.126
- He's a Hawk.
- He's a good player.

58:14.227 --> 58:17.025
- Yuck.
- Everybody hates him.

58:17.097 --> 58:20.361
- We don't need him.
- I'm the coach. I say we do need him.

58:20.432 --> 58:22.924
- If we make it to the play-offs,
he could be a big help. - If?

58:23.036 --> 58:25.129
All of a sudden you don't
think we're good enough.

58:25.238 --> 58:28.207
No, he thinks we're losers.
That's what he told Reilly.

58:28.275 --> 58:32.109
- What?
- We heard what you said.

58:32.212 --> 58:35.307
You said we were losers,
we didn't deserve to live.

58:35.416 --> 58:40.216
- That's not what I meant.
- I saw that picture of you missing that goal.

58:40.287 --> 58:44.485
You were a Hawk, weren't you? Guess
you guys stick together to the end.

58:44.591 --> 58:48.392
You know what?
I don't need your stinkin'equipment.

58:48.462 --> 58:52.728
- See you around.
- Peter, come back here.

58:52.800 --> 58:55.996
- I'm talkin' to you, son!
- Forget it, cake-eater.

58:56.102 --> 59:00.596
If you wanna play, play with yourself.
Come on, Terry.

59:03.744 --> 59:05.905
Where do you guys
think you're goin'?

59:08.683 --> 59:13.176
I don't believe this.

59:13.286 --> 59:17.519
All right, I'm goin' up to the bench
because that's where I'm supposed to be.

59:17.625 --> 59:21.459
Anyone who wants to join me
can join me. Anyone who doesn't -

59:21.529 --> 59:25.260
Well -

59:39.448 --> 59:41.349
Ten minutes to game time, coach.

59:41.451 --> 59:43.351
Yeah, yeah, they'll
be out in a minute.

59:43.453 --> 59:46.478
They're, you know, working
themselves into a frenzy.

59:58.668 --> 01:00:01.101
Not much of a frenzy.

01:00:04.206 --> 01:00:06.800
We forfeit.

01:00:06.909 --> 01:00:09.344
Ducks forfeit. Flames, you win.

01:00:15.418 --> 01:00:17.852
Hey. Can I sit?

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.854
Sure.

01:00:22.091 --> 01:00:24.025
You talk to the guys?

01:00:24.093 --> 01:00:27.529
I tried. They think I'm a traitor
for even showing up.

01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:30.292
I guess they
really hate me, huh?

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:33.426
Is it true you were
really a Hawk?

01:00:34.771 --> 01:00:36.705
Yeah.

01:00:36.773 --> 01:00:40.903
Peter said you blew
a really big game once.

01:00:40.977 --> 01:00:42.911
Yeah, well, Peter's right.

01:00:42.979 --> 01:00:45.209
It was the last game
of the state finals.

01:00:45.281 --> 01:00:47.876
We were tied 2-2
in the end of the third period.

01:00:47.952 --> 01:00:49.886
I get a penalty shot.

01:00:49.954 --> 01:00:53.889
I go in, I triple deke.
I fake the goalie right out of his pads.

01:00:53.957 --> 01:00:55.891
The puck's headed in,
and then...

01:00:55.959 --> 01:00:58.723
Clang! Hits the post.

01:00:58.795 --> 01:01:01.230
We lost in overtime.

01:01:01.298 --> 01:01:04.392
A quarter of an inch this way
and it would have gone in.

01:01:04.468 --> 01:01:06.436
A quarter of an inch, Charlie.

01:01:06.503 --> 01:01:10.905
Yeah, but a quarter inch the other way
and you'd have missed completely.

01:01:10.974 --> 01:01:12.908
I never thought of it that way.

01:01:12.976 --> 01:01:15.445
At least you got to play
in a championship game.

01:01:15.512 --> 01:01:19.676
- That must've been so cool.
- Hey. Can I get you a cup of coffee?

01:01:19.783 --> 01:01:22.081
I'd love one.

01:01:24.488 --> 01:01:27.924
You know, she has many fine qualities
that men find attractive.

01:01:27.992 --> 01:01:30.825
I know that, Charlie.
That fact hasn't escaped me.

01:01:30.928 --> 01:01:33.522
So, what kind of guys
does she usually date?

01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:36.030
Jerks. I mean,
most of them like her,

01:01:36.133 --> 01:01:38.158
but as soon as they
catch a glimpse of me -

01:01:38.268 --> 01:01:41.466
Pow! Warp speed!
They are gone!

01:01:41.539 --> 01:01:43.768
- Don't take it personally, Charlie.
- Oh, I wouldn't even care...

01:01:43.874 --> 01:01:45.808
except it's not fair to my mom.

01:01:45.876 --> 01:01:48.538
She deserves somebody nice.

01:01:48.645 --> 01:01:51.637
Are you gonna come over
for dinner again?

01:01:51.715 --> 01:01:53.650
I don't know, Charlie.

01:01:53.718 --> 01:01:56.653
I'm not sure
it's such a good idea.

01:01:56.721 --> 01:01:59.348
See, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

01:01:59.456 --> 01:02:03.859
I, um, talked
toJesse and Terry's dad,

01:02:03.961 --> 01:02:06.988
and he's gonna take over
coaching for the rest of the year.

01:02:07.065 --> 01:02:10.159
- You're quitting?
- I'm stepping aside to keep the team together.

01:02:10.235 --> 01:02:12.169
The guys can't play for
somebody they don't trust.

01:02:12.237 --> 01:02:14.330
I trust you.
The other guys do too.

01:02:14.406 --> 01:02:16.498
They just don't know it.
Talk to 'em.

01:02:16.573 --> 01:02:19.566
- I've done all I can.
- No, you haven't.

01:02:19.677 --> 01:02:22.840
You gotta make 'em understand.
You can't walk out on the Ducks.

01:02:22.914 --> 01:02:25.007
- We're your team.
- No, you're not.

01:02:25.083 --> 01:02:28.018
We are too! We weren't even
the Ducks until you came along.

01:02:28.086 --> 01:02:31.180
You made us and now
you're stuck with us.

01:02:31.256 --> 01:02:33.190
Charlie.

01:02:36.728 --> 01:02:39.856
That's right.
The red is oxygen.

01:02:39.931 --> 01:02:42.661
Now what are the blue balls?

01:02:44.736 --> 01:02:46.898
- Tommy?
- Hydrogen?

01:02:47.006 --> 01:02:49.201
Is correct.
Now put them together...

01:02:49.275 --> 01:02:53.404
and you have a molecule
that makes up 96% of your body.

01:02:53.511 --> 01:02:55.706
- What is it?
- Pizza?

01:02:57.916 --> 01:03:01.853
It's the principal. I'll be right back.

01:03:01.921 --> 01:03:06.756
Work on H2 CO3.
It's a goody.

01:03:08.626 --> 01:03:12.563
- How'd the forfeit go, Spaz-way?
- Yeah, did you score?

01:03:12.631 --> 01:03:14.929
Leave me alone, guys.
I don't want to talk about the team.

01:03:15.034 --> 01:03:16.899
Oh, yeah, sure.
Coach's pet.

01:03:16.969 --> 01:03:19.233
Everybody knows
he likes you best.

01:03:19.305 --> 01:03:22.069
- Likes his mom, you mean.
- Take it back, Karp!

01:03:22.141 --> 01:03:24.074
Take it back now!

01:03:24.142 --> 01:03:26.043
- Leave him alone.
- You have no right shoving Karp.

01:03:26.112 --> 01:03:28.239
- Don't push me.
- Don't push her, she's a girl!

01:03:28.314 --> 01:03:30.407
- Lay off!
- Don't shove, Peter.

01:03:32.485 --> 01:03:34.919
Atoms away!

01:03:42.128 --> 01:03:44.221
My atoms!

01:03:44.296 --> 01:03:46.321
You! Sit!

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:50.799
Sit now!

01:03:50.903 --> 01:03:53.600
In your seats now!

01:04:00.579 --> 01:04:02.945
I have never in my life -

01:04:03.015 --> 01:04:06.281
What have you got to say
for yourselves?

01:04:06.353 --> 01:04:08.287
Quack.

01:04:08.355 --> 01:04:12.689
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!

01:04:12.959 --> 01:04:15.586
Thanks for coming by
on such short notice, Gordon.

01:04:15.661 --> 01:04:17.595
By the way, your court
release came through.

01:04:17.663 --> 01:04:20.599
- Congratulations. Your community service is over.
- You're kidding.

01:04:20.667 --> 01:04:23.101
So you wanted to talk
about my coming back to work then?

01:04:23.170 --> 01:04:25.263
- Well, actually -
- Oh, you got your jersey. Great!

01:04:25.338 --> 01:04:29.331
A lot's been happening.
The Ducks might even make the play-offs.

01:04:29.442 --> 01:04:33.674
Gordon, you know
Coach Reilly and Mr. Banks.

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:35.680
Sir, they're the bad guys.

01:04:35.782 --> 01:04:38.512
No, actually, Phil is
one of my oldest friends.

01:04:38.618 --> 01:04:42.850
Gerald was kind enough to get us all together
here to try to work out this little problem.

01:04:42.956 --> 01:04:45.687
You see, my son Adam
wants to play for the Hawks.

01:04:45.793 --> 01:04:47.988
His older brother was a Hawk.

01:04:48.062 --> 01:04:51.462
All of his little friends are Hawks.
That's where he belongs.

01:04:51.531 --> 01:04:55.365
It's a tradition. You understand that,
Gordon. You played.

01:04:55.468 --> 01:04:58.029
But the league's
already ruled on it.

01:04:58.139 --> 01:05:01.131
We've talked to the league,
and we worked out a little deal.

01:05:01.209 --> 01:05:04.337
- You guys cut a deal with the Pee Wee Hockey League?
- Yes, we did.

01:05:04.412 --> 01:05:08.541
The long and short of it is that Adam stays
on the Hawks for the rest of the season.

01:05:08.648 --> 01:05:11.379
And then next year,
they redraft the lines.

01:05:11.485 --> 01:05:14.215
- Correctly.
- The league did make one condition.

01:05:14.322 --> 01:05:16.222
What's that?

01:05:16.324 --> 01:05:19.225
That you withdraw your protest.

01:05:21.329 --> 01:05:24.230
- That's great.
- Good, good.

01:05:24.332 --> 01:05:26.232
Well, that's settled then.

01:05:26.334 --> 01:05:28.734
No, sir, you don't understand.

01:05:28.836 --> 01:05:31.031
I can't withdraw my protest.

01:05:31.105 --> 01:05:33.699
- What?
- Mr. Ducksworth,

01:05:33.774 --> 01:05:36.208
you wanted me to learn
about fair play...

01:05:36.277 --> 01:05:39.212
and how to be part
of a team...

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.215
and I may not have
learned everything yet,

01:05:42.283 --> 01:05:45.218
but I remember something
my father said to me.

01:05:45.286 --> 01:05:48.221
A team isn't a bunch
of kids out to win.

01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:51.555
A team is something
you belong to,

01:05:51.627 --> 01:05:54.562
something you feel,

01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:57.564
something you have to earn.

01:05:57.632 --> 01:06:00.726
And I'm not gonna
let those kids down.

01:06:11.647 --> 01:06:14.740
Gordon, I'm going
to make this simple.

01:06:14.815 --> 01:06:20.584
Are you prepared to lose your job
over some kids? Some game?

01:06:20.656 --> 01:06:23.921
Let me ask you, sir.

01:06:23.992 --> 01:06:28.429
Are you prepared to fire me
over some kids? Some game?

01:06:28.497 --> 01:06:33.230
Collect your personal
belongings, Gordon.

01:06:35.570 --> 01:06:38.835
Yes, sir, Mr. Ducksworth!

01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:40.840
Thank you very much,
Mr. Ducksworth!

01:06:40.942 --> 01:06:43.912
Quack, quack, quack, quack,
quack, Mr. Ducksworth!

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:47.779
- Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
- Gordon, stop quacking.

01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:56.285
You may have paid for this jersey, sir,
but you didn't earn it.

01:06:56.359 --> 01:06:59.817
I'll see you in the play-offs.

01:07:05.634 --> 01:07:09.435
- Excuse me. There are some students here that I'd like to see.
- Who are you?

01:07:09.505 --> 01:07:11.439
I'm their hockey coach.

01:07:11.507 --> 01:07:15.876
If you could tell me where
I can find each of them, please.

01:07:15.978 --> 01:07:18.446
They're in room 223.

01:07:18.514 --> 01:07:22.473
- All of them?
- All of them.

01:07:22.552 --> 01:07:32.657
"I will not quack
at the principal. "

01:07:32.729 --> 01:07:35.163
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to you guys.

01:07:35.231 --> 01:07:38.166
- People.
- People, right.

01:07:38.234 --> 01:07:40.168
Sit down, please.
All of you.

01:07:42.805 --> 01:07:44.796
Okay, don't sit down.

01:07:44.874 --> 01:07:47.172
Look, what's done is done.

01:07:47.243 --> 01:07:49.838
I want to be your coach again.

01:07:49.913 --> 01:07:52.381
You're gonna coach
a bunch of losers?

01:07:52.483 --> 01:07:55.178
- No, I want to coach the Ducks.
- What about the things you said?

01:07:55.251 --> 01:07:57.549
You said we didn't
deserve to live.

01:07:57.653 --> 01:08:01.350
Karp, I was being sarcastic.
Do you know what that means?

01:08:01.424 --> 01:08:04.519
- No.
- Okay, then you do.

01:08:04.595 --> 01:08:07.189
I didn't mean those things
the way they sounded.

01:08:07.264 --> 01:08:10.062
You guys know what it's like
to be misunderstood, right?

01:08:10.167 --> 01:08:12.862
- Yeah, of course. We're kids.
- So...

01:08:12.935 --> 01:08:16.394
Can you forgive me?
Can I be your coach again?

01:08:16.506 --> 01:08:20.033
- What about Banks?
- He can be on the team if he wants.

01:08:20.109 --> 01:08:21.907
He should have been
with us all year.

01:08:22.011 --> 01:08:26.210
It's you guys who were cheated.
Let's forget all that crap!

01:08:26.283 --> 01:08:30.082
- We're a team, right?
- Yeah.

01:08:30.187 --> 01:08:34.590
I made you guys,
and I'm sticking with you.

01:08:34.691 --> 01:08:38.854
So, what's it gonna be?

01:08:38.929 --> 01:08:42.194
We can play tomorrow night and still
have a shot at the play-offs...

01:08:42.267 --> 01:08:47.397
or we can forfeit again
and the season's over.

01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:49.598
Peter, what do you say?

01:08:49.706 --> 01:08:52.607
Well...

01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:56.441
I guess it would help
if we practised first.

01:08:56.548 --> 01:08:59.448
All right. Let me see if I can
get you out of detention.

01:08:59.551 --> 01:09:01.745
- Yes.
- Take that.

01:09:01.819 --> 01:09:03.912
You really quacked
at the principal?

01:09:03.987 --> 01:09:06.216
Yeah.

01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:08.919
Are we Ducks, or what?

01:09:08.993 --> 01:09:10.756
Yeah!

01:09:12.964 --> 01:09:14.898
Look at your mother.

01:09:14.966 --> 01:09:17.901
Let's see how it is
in ten minutes.

01:09:17.969 --> 01:09:19.902
I'm gonna kill you!

01:09:32.317 --> 01:09:35.252
Hey. Wasn't sure
if you'd show up.

01:09:35.319 --> 01:09:37.254
Yeah, whatever.

01:09:37.322 --> 01:09:39.756
- I just want to play hockey.
- Good.

01:09:39.823 --> 01:09:42.917
Ducks, you all know Adam Banks.

01:09:42.993 --> 01:09:45.258
On behalf of the Ducks,
I'd like to say welcome.

01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:48.163
Cake-eater.

01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:51.634
Ooh, theJess-man, dissin'the new guy!
TheJess-ster!

01:09:51.703 --> 01:09:53.933
Shut up, Averman!

01:09:54.005 --> 01:09:56.769
It's just a joke.

01:09:56.841 --> 01:10:02.439
Puttin' on a Ducks jersey
doesn't mean you're a real Duck.

01:10:27.406 --> 01:10:31.502
- They're a good group once you get to know 'em.
- I bet.

01:10:31.577 --> 01:10:35.172
Well, suit up.
I'll see you on the ice.

01:10:48.994 --> 01:10:50.894
On your left!

01:10:52.998 --> 01:10:54.694
Over here!

01:10:54.768 --> 01:10:57.032
I'm open!

01:10:57.103 --> 01:11:00.560
Come on, right here!
Up front!

01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:04.605
- Up front!
- Pass it to Banks!

01:11:06.178 --> 01:11:08.204
Come on!
Do somethin' with it!

01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:12.917
Yeah! All right!

01:11:14.754 --> 01:11:17.586
Way to go, Banks!

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:19.716
All right!
Score another one for the Ducks!

01:11:24.698 --> 01:11:27.098
Goldberg, you're gonna
sit this one out.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.226
What? You're pulling
the goalie when we're tied?

01:11:30.303 --> 01:11:32.237
Listen, listen, listen!

01:11:32.305 --> 01:11:35.240
A tie isn't gonna help us.
We need the win.

01:11:35.308 --> 01:11:38.209
Okay, Fulton,
you're our extra man.

01:11:38.278 --> 01:11:41.372
Everybody, get the puck to Fulton.
That's your job.

01:11:41.448 --> 01:11:44.246
- We pulling the Statue of Liberty play?
- Yeah?

01:11:44.317 --> 01:11:47.446
No, take your shot. You may only
get one, so it's gotta be good.

01:11:47.555 --> 01:11:50.580
- But, coach, one outta one?
- Soft hands, Fulton.

01:11:50.657 --> 01:11:53.751
- Concentration, not strength.
- That's right!

01:11:53.827 --> 01:11:56.125
Okay? Let's get the Huskies!

01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:58.254
Let's go! Come on!

01:12:06.507 --> 01:12:09.964
Let's back it up, boys.
Let's make it a fair one. Let's go!

01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:18.250
- Get in there!
- Come on!

01:12:23.991 --> 01:12:26.960
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

01:12:28.162 --> 01:12:30.130
Shoot, Fulton, shoot!

01:12:39.341 --> 01:12:41.467
We won!

01:12:46.213 --> 01:12:48.147
We made the play-offs!

01:13:01.829 --> 01:13:03.729
Boy, this is great.

01:13:03.831 --> 01:13:05.993
Guys, look, it's the North Stars.

01:13:06.068 --> 01:13:09.333
- Oh, man.
- It's Mike Modano!

01:13:12.407 --> 01:13:14.341
- ... Believe this?
- Cool!

01:13:14.409 --> 01:13:16.342
This is too cool.

01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:18.572
I can't believe this.

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:21.911
This place is humongous.

01:13:22.017 --> 01:13:24.417
What are we doing here?

01:13:24.519 --> 01:13:26.544
It's a little play-offs present.

01:13:32.561 --> 01:13:35.496
Hey, Gordo!
Gordon Bombay, right?

01:13:35.564 --> 01:13:37.998
- You remember me?
- Sure, from Pee Wees.

01:13:38.066 --> 01:13:41.695
- This guy used to rule in Pee Wees.
- I heard you were a farmer.

01:13:41.770 --> 01:13:43.704
Actually, I became a lawyer.

01:13:43.772 --> 01:13:46.037
But I'm coaching Pee Wee now
and this is my team, the Ducks.

01:13:46.109 --> 01:13:50.204
- Ducks, this is Basil McRae and Mike Modano.
- We can see that.

01:13:50.278 --> 01:13:52.212
- All right.
- Hey, Ducks!

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.248
Listen to this guy.
He knows what he's talking about.

01:13:54.349 --> 01:13:57.580
If you ever want a shot, I'll get you
a tryout in the minor league clubs.

01:13:57.687 --> 01:14:00.713
- Thanks.
- No problem. Hey, nice seein' ya.

01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:03.020
Take it easy.

01:14:03.092 --> 01:14:06.219
All right, let's have some fun!

01:14:06.294 --> 01:14:11.232
~ You've got to accentuate
the positive ~

01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:15.236
~Eliminate the negative ~

01:14:15.304 --> 01:14:19.400
~Latch on to the affirmative ~

01:14:19.475 --> 01:14:22.409
~Don't mess
with Mister In-between ~

01:14:22.477 --> 01:14:27.438
~ You've got to spread joy
up to the maximum ~

01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:31.543
~Bring gloom
down to that minimum ~

01:14:31.621 --> 01:14:35.216
~Have faith or pandemonium ~

01:14:35.291 --> 01:14:37.760
~ You're liable
to walk upon the sea ~

01:14:37.828 --> 01:14:41.888
~ To illustrate my last remark ~

01:14:41.964 --> 01:14:46.560
~ Talking aboutJonah in a whale
and Noah in an ark ~

01:14:46.636 --> 01:14:51.574
~ What did they do
when everything looked so dark ~

01:14:51.642 --> 01:14:54.611
~ Then they say ~

01:14:54.678 --> 01:14:59.580
~ You better
accentuate the positive ~

01:14:59.649 --> 01:15:03.586
~Eliminate that negative ~

01:15:03.654 --> 01:15:07.590
~Latch on to the affirmative ~

01:15:07.658 --> 01:15:10.593
~Don't mess
with Mister In-between ~

01:15:26.343 --> 01:15:31.781
~ We better
accentuate the positive ~

01:15:31.849 --> 01:15:35.182
~Eliminate all the negative ~

01:15:35.285 --> 01:15:38.982
~Latch on to the affirmative ~

01:15:39.056 --> 01:15:42.116
~Don't mess
with Mister In-between ~

01:15:42.192 --> 01:15:46.653
~No, don't mess
with Mister In-between ~

01:15:46.731 --> 01:15:48.664
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:15:48.732 --> 01:15:52.668
~Don't you mess
with Mister In-between ~~

01:15:54.738 --> 01:15:58.197
You know, I heard the North Stars
wore the same underwear...

01:15:58.309 --> 01:16:01.210
all through the play-offs
last year for luck.

01:16:01.312 --> 01:16:03.212
So I'm doin' the same thing.

01:16:03.314 --> 01:16:06.214
Hmm. Maybe I should've cooked.

01:16:06.316 --> 01:16:10.253
You know, I'm thinkin' maybe we can all
go down to the winter festival tonight.

01:16:10.355 --> 01:16:12.255
- All three of us?
- Sure.

01:16:12.357 --> 01:16:14.689
I don't think I should,
'cause I got a lot of homework.

01:16:14.759 --> 01:16:18.195
You should go. With my mom.
By yourselves.

01:16:20.265 --> 01:16:23.234
Mmm, smells great!

01:16:23.334 --> 01:16:25.859
Hello.

01:16:25.937 --> 01:16:28.235
Go for it.

01:16:28.339 --> 01:16:30.432
Hi.

01:16:33.278 --> 01:16:36.214
I don't know how they sculpt these.

01:16:36.282 --> 01:16:38.545
Hmm, I wonder.

01:16:38.616 --> 01:16:42.245
I used to sculpt,
but now I do mostly paintings.

01:16:42.353 --> 01:16:45.550
How do you think
they do the details?

01:16:45.623 --> 01:16:49.890
Oh, little men.
Tiny chisels, big mittens.

01:16:49.962 --> 01:16:52.897
Oh.

01:16:52.965 --> 01:16:54.898
I'm nervous.

01:16:54.966 --> 01:16:56.900
I'm rambling on and on here.

01:16:56.968 --> 01:16:58.902
You probably think I'm weird.

01:16:58.970 --> 01:17:02.236
No, I think you're great.

01:17:14.319 --> 01:17:18.757
When I was a little girl, I used
to pretend that that was an ice castle.

01:17:18.824 --> 01:17:21.918
And that was my room,
that window right up there.

01:17:21.994 --> 01:17:24.087
And last winter
I gave Charlie that one.

01:17:24.163 --> 01:17:27.257
What about me?
Which window's mine?

01:17:27.333 --> 01:17:30.769
I want to live there too.

01:17:34.907 --> 01:17:38.809
What? What did I say?

01:17:38.911 --> 01:17:42.848
- It's just not that easy.
- What's not that easy?

01:17:42.949 --> 01:17:45.178
Casey, I was just
playin' around.

01:17:45.284 --> 01:17:48.185
Look, I don't know
how you feel about me.

01:17:48.287 --> 01:17:50.482
I don't even know
how I feel about you.

01:17:50.589 --> 01:17:53.990
But I do know there's
a little kid back home...

01:17:54.093 --> 01:17:57.586
who's absolutely falling
in love with his coach...

01:17:57.664 --> 01:17:59.928
and if you
can't deal with that,

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.297
if you're just playing around,
then you better let me know.

01:18:02.368 --> 01:18:04.302
What are we talking?
'Til death do us part?

01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:07.203
- I have to decide on the first date?
- Stop it, Gordon.

01:18:07.306 --> 01:18:10.208
Charlie's gonna be there
when we get back.

01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:13.473
And tomorrow.
And ten years from now.

01:18:13.546 --> 01:18:15.980
Look, I can take it.

01:18:16.049 --> 01:18:21.213
But if Charlie
gets too attached -

01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:25.052
Every time this happens,
it gets...

01:18:25.158 --> 01:18:27.649
a little rougher on him.

01:18:29.896 --> 01:18:32.387
Just on him?

01:18:53.753 --> 01:18:56.654
I'm glad to be here with you.

01:18:57.924 --> 01:19:00.017
Me too.

01:19:00.393 --> 01:19:03.227
The surprising Ducks
are still in this game...

01:19:03.330 --> 01:19:05.855
against the Hornets.

01:19:05.933 --> 01:19:09.266
Banks moving right in front, stops.
He shoots, he scores!

01:19:15.076 --> 01:19:19.035
It's getting rough out there
between the Ducks and the Hornets.

01:19:19.113 --> 01:19:22.605
Here's Adam Banks in the slot.
He stops, shoots. He scores!

01:19:27.621 --> 01:19:32.388
Back it goes to Averman.
He shoots! Score!

01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:36.556
The ducks win it,
5-3 over the Hornets.

01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:38.894
And now it's on
to the semifinals...

01:19:38.966 --> 01:19:42.403
where the Ducks
will face the Cardinals.

01:19:49.977 --> 01:19:53.276
What a game so far, ladies and
gentlemen! The Ducks and the Cardinals!

01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:55.747
Cardinals with it in their own zone,
tryin'to clear it out.

01:19:55.817 --> 01:19:57.876
Pass to the blue line,
intercepted by the Ducks.

01:19:57.953 --> 01:20:02.252
Here's their star, Adam Banks. Banks
has great speed. Right down the middle!

01:20:02.323 --> 01:20:05.918
Goes around one man with a great move!
Steps around another defender!

01:20:05.993 --> 01:20:07.928
He scores!

01:20:22.911 --> 01:20:25.573
Come on! Come on,Jesse!

01:20:25.647 --> 01:20:27.979
Ducks with it again.

01:20:28.083 --> 01:20:31.246
Here's Averman,
now getting it over to Banks.

01:20:31.319 --> 01:20:33.254
Germaine is right in the slot.
Germaine with it!

01:20:33.322 --> 01:20:35.289
He shoots, he scores!

01:20:35.357 --> 01:20:38.121
Germaine put it off
the goaltender's glove into the net!

01:20:38.193 --> 01:20:41.458
And that does it! The Ducks have won!
Can you believe it?

01:20:41.530 --> 01:20:47.265
4-2, and the Ducks now get set
to face the Hawks in the state finals.

01:21:09.357 --> 01:21:11.621
All right, it's up to you, Gordon.

01:21:11.693 --> 01:21:14.959
Now,you miss this shot,
you're not just letting your team down,

01:21:15.031 --> 01:21:17.625
you're letting me down too.

01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:20.464
Remember, it's not worth playing -

01:21:20.536 --> 01:21:23.733
- If you can't win.
- That's right. Okay, son, let's go.

01:21:34.483 --> 01:21:36.747
Let's go, son!

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:48.088
~... Oh, say does
that star-spangled ~

01:22:48.159 --> 01:22:52.288
~Banner yet wave ~

01:22:52.396 --> 01:22:56.730
~ O'er the land of the free ~

01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:02.262
~And the home of the brave ~~

01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:05.434
- Let's go!
- Let's go! All right!

01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:08.103
Welcome to the Minnesota
State Pee Wee Championship.

01:23:08.178 --> 01:23:10.237
Have we got a game for you today.

01:23:10.314 --> 01:23:12.283
The Hawks, coached byJack Reilly.

01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:19.285
Win, win, win, win, win!

01:23:19.357 --> 01:23:22.920
Win, win, win, win!

01:23:22.993 --> 01:23:24.962
Win, win, win, win, win!

01:23:27.031 --> 01:23:28.965
Ducks, let's fire it up!

01:23:29.033 --> 01:23:30.967
Come on, let's get fired up!

01:23:31.035 --> 01:23:33.469
Quack, quack,
quack, quack!

01:23:33.538 --> 01:23:35.301
Quack, quack, quack, quack!

01:23:35.373 --> 01:23:37.273
Quack, quack,
quack, quack!

01:23:37.342 --> 01:23:39.311
Quack, quack, quack, quack!

01:23:39.378 --> 01:23:41.174
Quack, quack,
quack, quack!

01:23:41.279 --> 01:23:42.803
Quack, quack, quack, quack!

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.814
Quack, quack,
quack, quack!

01:23:44.882 --> 01:23:47.976
Go... Ducks!
Let's go!

01:23:57.395 --> 01:23:59.329
Hey, Banks.

01:23:59.397 --> 01:24:02.332
Don't forget what side you're on.

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:06.132
He's a Duck,Jesse.
He'll play like a Duck.

01:24:23.756 --> 01:24:25.917
And the game is underway,

01:24:26.024 --> 01:24:29.482
and right off Larson and McGill
with a heavy hit.

01:24:29.561 --> 01:24:34.191
That gives you an indication
of what you're going to see tonight.

01:24:34.266 --> 01:24:37.201
Good hit! That's the way
I want you guys to play it!

01:24:44.277 --> 01:24:47.075
The Ducks in green
chasing it down against -

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:49.875
A hard hit out at centre ice!

01:24:49.948 --> 01:24:52.178
Keep it away from 'em!
Come on, Banks!

01:24:52.251 --> 01:24:54.549
Heavy hitting continues
in this championship game.

01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:57.556
Banks up the centre ice.
He drives it down into the Hawks'zone.

01:24:57.624 --> 01:25:00.889
Back in again to Larson,
the man behind the net.

01:25:15.975 --> 01:25:18.910
Go, go, go!
Get it out of there!

01:25:20.547 --> 01:25:22.377
Banks, two comin' hard!

01:25:22.448 --> 01:25:25.077
Banks still looking
for an opening, moves it up -

01:25:25.151 --> 01:25:29.884
Banks gets knocked down against the boards.
The puck is intercepted by the Hawks.

01:25:29.956 --> 01:25:33.824
Here's Larson, over to Brown. Brown,
in front, goes backhand. He scores!

01:25:58.685 --> 01:26:00.482
Come on! Hustle!

01:26:08.829 --> 01:26:10.763
Come on, you guys!

01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:16.261
Hawks with a 1-0 lead,
come back to centre ice.

01:26:16.337 --> 01:26:18.271
Larson gives it up to McGill.

01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:20.773
Here's McGill, inside,
the lead at centre ice.

01:26:20.841 --> 01:26:23.674
He's up on the blue line
and around the net.

01:26:23.777 --> 01:26:25.677
And he scores!

01:26:28.848 --> 01:26:32.376
And now the Hawks lead 2-0.

01:26:39.894 --> 01:26:42.124
Good save, Goldberg!

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:57.811
All right, all right!
That's the kind of hockey...

01:26:57.879 --> 01:26:59.813
I want to see
played all day, boys.

01:27:03.317 --> 01:27:05.217
Larson stopped at the blue line,

01:27:05.319 --> 01:27:07.685
but the Ducks can't clear it out.

01:27:07.755 --> 01:27:10.054
McGill to Brown, left side.
He shoots! He scores!

01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:19.830
The Hawks lead late
in the first period, 3-0.

01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:23.064
Don't be scared of them, Ducks.
That's what they want.

01:27:23.171 --> 01:27:26.231
Keep your heads up.
Play proud.

01:27:26.341 --> 01:27:29.401
Let's fly! Come on, let's go!

01:27:29.511 --> 01:27:31.911
All right, pressure, boys.
Pressure, pressure!

01:27:32.013 --> 01:27:33.913
All right, hold it, hold it.

01:27:34.015 --> 01:27:38.008
I want you to drop Banks like a bad
habit. I want him outta the game.

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:40.213
- Finish him off. You got it?
- Yeah.

01:27:40.288 --> 01:27:41.880
Okay, boys, let's go.

01:27:41.957 --> 01:27:44.221
All right, all right, all right,
all right, all right!

01:27:44.292 --> 01:27:47.056
Face-off for the second period,
and the Hawks win the draw.

01:27:47.128 --> 01:27:49.893
They get it back to Stickler.
3-0, Hawks lead.

01:27:49.966 --> 01:27:53.230
Stickler to the blue line of the Ducks.
His pass taken away by Conway.

01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:54.928
Go after him!

01:27:55.036 --> 01:27:57.436
Taken by Adam Banks.
Here's Banks across the blue line!

01:27:57.539 --> 01:27:59.439
McGill from behind!
Knocks Banks down!

01:27:59.541 --> 01:28:01.874
Banks shoots! He scores!

01:28:01.944 --> 01:28:04.606
Adam Banks with a great goal
for the Ducks!

01:28:04.714 --> 01:28:09.242
McGill knocked him down
from behind, but Banks scored.

01:28:14.557 --> 01:28:16.457
Adam.

01:28:16.559 --> 01:28:18.550
Adam, are you okay?

01:28:18.628 --> 01:28:22.894
- What'd you do?
- My job.

01:28:22.965 --> 01:28:26.799
Okay, we need the paramedics in.
He's injured.

01:28:26.901 --> 01:28:29.234
Oh, my God.

01:28:29.305 --> 01:28:31.500
Come on, son, let's go.
Come on.

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.180
Number seven, McGill.

01:28:40.282 --> 01:28:42.342
Cross-checking.
Two minutes.

01:28:42.452 --> 01:28:45.181
Don't worry, guys.

01:28:50.292 --> 01:28:52.453
Did it go in?

01:28:52.528 --> 01:28:56.522
- Yeah, man.
- Jesse, do me a favour.

01:28:56.633 --> 01:28:58.601
Kick some Hawk butt.

01:28:58.669 --> 01:29:01.603
All right, cake-eater.

01:29:06.976 --> 01:29:09.207
He'll be okay, sir.
We need to take some X rays, though.

01:29:09.312 --> 01:29:11.712
Hell of a job, son.

01:29:15.118 --> 01:29:17.382
They score against us,
they're gonna pay the price.

01:29:17.487 --> 01:29:20.547
Now, don't worry.
We're gonna get that one back.

01:29:20.657 --> 01:29:22.648
You got somethin'
to say to me, Bombay?

01:29:22.726 --> 01:29:28.130
To think I wasted all those years
worrying about what you thought.

01:29:30.567 --> 01:29:33.195
You're goin' down, Reilly.

01:29:41.144 --> 01:29:43.908
- Let me go after 'em, coach. Let me get 'em.
- No, we're better than that.

01:29:44.014 --> 01:29:48.918
Look, look, it's time
to play smart hockey, Duck hockey.

01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:52.420
- All right? Now we got the power play.
- Yeah. All right.

01:29:52.522 --> 01:29:57.186
We're gonna hit 'em
where it hurts the most: up there.

01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:59.387
Fulton, you're in.

01:29:59.496 --> 01:30:01.522
- Coach, they'll be rushin' him.
- Right.

01:30:01.599 --> 01:30:04.067
Jesse, make sure you give
Fulton plenty of time.

01:30:04.168 --> 01:30:05.863
- Right, coach.
- Jesse, do good.

01:30:05.937 --> 01:30:07.336
Let's go!

01:30:07.405 --> 01:30:09.998
- Yeah!
- Hold it! Wait! Whoa!

01:30:10.073 --> 01:30:11.870
Let's have fun out there.

01:30:11.942 --> 01:30:13.877
- All right!
- All right!

01:30:13.945 --> 01:30:15.776
Let's go!
Let's go!

01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:19.213
The Ducks trail 3-1, and now they
call on number 44, Fulton Reed...

01:30:19.283 --> 01:30:21.717
Get the face-off!

01:30:21.786 --> 01:30:24.050
...who has a big, booming shot.

01:30:24.122 --> 01:30:26.886
And the Ducks get it
back to Fulton Reed.

01:30:26.958 --> 01:30:30.860
Hall clears the front of the net.
Here's Reed winding.

01:30:34.966 --> 01:30:37.230
He scores!

01:30:37.301 --> 01:30:41.033
Fulton Reed has scored,
and the Ducks are back in the game!

01:30:41.106 --> 01:30:43.972
Yeah! Yeah!

01:30:46.043 --> 01:30:48.568
Yes!

01:30:48.646 --> 01:30:51.410
Yes! That's it!

01:30:51.482 --> 01:30:54.714
More fun! More fun!

01:30:54.787 --> 01:30:58.746
Of all the sloppy ass - Ladies,
they don't need our help out there!

01:30:58.824 --> 01:31:01.257
Now I want that
Fulton Reed covered.

01:31:01.325 --> 01:31:03.759
He better not make another shot.
You got it?

01:31:03.828 --> 01:31:09.267
I'm tellin' you, you blow this game
and nobody makes the team next year!

01:31:09.334 --> 01:31:11.768
All right, get out there!

01:31:32.024 --> 01:31:33.924
Quick feet, now!
Quick feet!

01:31:33.992 --> 01:31:35.926
The puck comes around,
now to Blake on the right side.

01:31:35.994 --> 01:31:38.929
Blake through the slot
with a backhand. Scores!

01:31:38.997 --> 01:31:41.158
Blake with a backhanded goal,

01:31:41.266 --> 01:31:45.636
and the Hawks regain
the two goal lead at 4-2.

01:31:45.705 --> 01:31:47.764
Guys, guys, guys,
listen up, listen.

01:31:47.841 --> 01:31:50.775
We have got to stay
fired up and focused, all right?

01:31:50.843 --> 01:31:52.868
It ain't over 'til it's over.

01:31:52.978 --> 01:31:57.278
Tammy, Tommy, let's show these Hawks
something really different. Come here.

01:31:57.349 --> 01:32:01.650
All right.
I want you guys to start up here -

01:32:01.721 --> 01:32:06.124
Third period and the Ducks trail 4-2,
trying desperately to get back in the game.

01:32:06.192 --> 01:32:08.523
The Ducks with Tammy
and Tommy Duncan on the ice.

01:32:08.627 --> 01:32:11.152
Tammy Duncan goes in front
of the net, Tommy with the puck.

01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:14.496
Tammy's spinning,
and the Hawks are just looking at her.

01:32:14.567 --> 01:32:16.330
- Come on.
- Come on!

01:32:16.402 --> 01:32:18.996
Now!

01:32:19.072 --> 01:32:21.370
Tammy Duncan shoots, she scores!

01:32:21.474 --> 01:32:23.703
Yes! Yes!
We're still alive!

01:32:34.587 --> 01:32:37.055
I'm on, coach.

01:32:37.156 --> 01:32:39.148
Yes, we're still in there!

01:32:40.326 --> 01:32:42.226
He Grabs McGill from behind...

01:32:42.328 --> 01:32:44.853
and throws him over the boards
into the bench.

01:32:44.931 --> 01:32:47.559
Now he wants to pick a fight
with the entire Hawks team.

01:32:47.667 --> 01:32:50.227
Fulton Reed has to be restrained
by the referee.

01:32:50.336 --> 01:32:52.567
Game misconduct.
You're outta here, son.

01:32:52.673 --> 01:32:54.573
I'm off, coach.

01:32:54.675 --> 01:32:56.836
He barely touched him.

01:33:07.454 --> 01:33:09.422
Oreo line!

01:33:09.523 --> 01:33:12.583
I want you to remember
what we learned.

01:33:12.693 --> 01:33:14.922
- Ducks stick together, right?
- Yeah!

01:33:15.028 --> 01:33:17.258
So let's see it!
Show me the flying "V."

01:33:17.363 --> 01:33:18.763
- All right!
- All right!

01:33:18.866 --> 01:33:21.198
Let's get a line change!
Let's go!

01:33:21.268 --> 01:33:24.396
Here we go!
Come on, y'all, let's go!

01:33:34.315 --> 01:33:35.942
Come on! Come on!

01:33:36.050 --> 01:33:38.041
Flying "V"!

01:33:38.118 --> 01:33:42.555
Jesse Hall goes behind his own net,
joined by the rest of his team.

01:33:42.623 --> 01:33:47.391
Here they come from behind the net!
It's the flying "V"!

01:33:50.164 --> 01:33:51.927
Come on! Come on!

01:33:51.999 --> 01:33:55.935
Terry Hall, with the puck,
moves the puck ahead to brotherJesse.

01:33:56.003 --> 01:33:59.963
They stay onside the blue line. Jesse
Hall with it, trying to come down the slot.

01:34:00.075 --> 01:34:03.772
Moves down the right side,
now in front of the net. Jesse scores!

01:34:26.001 --> 01:34:29.937
With the score tied 4-4, the next goal
will decide the championship.

01:34:30.005 --> 01:34:32.940
Tremendous pressure. Neither team
can afford any mistakes now.

01:34:33.008 --> 01:34:35.636
23 seconds left to go in regulation.

01:34:41.983 --> 01:34:44.383
Looking for
the game-winning goal,

01:34:44.486 --> 01:34:47.114
here's Morgan moving into the slot.
He shoots and a big save.

01:34:47.188 --> 01:34:51.148
Big save, Goldberg!
We'll get 'em in overtime!

01:34:51.227 --> 01:34:55.323
Score tied at four.
Now Averman ahead to Charlie Conway.

01:34:55.397 --> 01:34:57.627
- Come on, Charlie.
- Conway to centre ice on a breakaway!

01:34:57.699 --> 01:35:01.328
Conway moving across the Hawk blue line,
down the middle! He could win the game!

01:35:05.908 --> 01:35:09.002
Hey! Where's the call?

01:35:09.078 --> 01:35:13.514
No time left on the clock, but
the referee is calling a penalty shot!

01:35:14.682 --> 01:35:16.583
What kind of call is that?

01:35:16.685 --> 01:35:19.245
Okay, we've got a penalty shot
for the Ducks.

01:35:19.355 --> 01:35:22.586
Coach, penalty shot.
Anyone on the ice can take it.

01:35:24.693 --> 01:35:27.253
All right, Ducks,
who's gonna take it?

01:35:27.363 --> 01:35:29.262
- I think he should take it.
- Me?

01:35:29.364 --> 01:35:31.265
What about Charlie?

01:35:31.367 --> 01:35:33.528
- What about Charlie?
- All he does is fan.

01:35:33.602 --> 01:35:35.536
Let's let him finish
what he started.

01:35:35.604 --> 01:35:38.539
- Coach, we have a chance to win.
- Damn straight we do.

01:35:38.607 --> 01:35:42.202
Come here. You been practising
that triple deke?

01:35:42.278 --> 01:35:44.509
- Yeah.
- Then you're all set.

01:35:44.581 --> 01:35:47.014
You may make it, you may not.

01:35:47.083 --> 01:35:50.211
But that doesn't matter, Charlie.
What matters is that we're here.

01:35:50.286 --> 01:35:52.220
Look around.

01:35:52.288 --> 01:35:55.052
Whoever thought
we'd make it this far?

01:35:55.124 --> 01:35:59.562
One, two, three.
Triple deke.

01:35:59.629 --> 01:36:02.257
Take your best shot.

01:36:02.365 --> 01:36:06.892
I believe in you, Charlie,
win or lose.

01:36:06.969 --> 01:36:11.066
- Thanks, coach.
- Go get 'em.

01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:17.246
- All right, Charlie.
- Let's go, Charlie.

01:36:27.991 --> 01:36:30.892
Okay, now wait for my signal.
Good luck.

01:36:38.735 --> 01:36:44.605
Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,

01:36:44.674 --> 01:36:48.941
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie...

01:36:49.013 --> 01:36:52.244
Okay, now don't leave your crease
before he touches the puck. Good luck.

01:37:05.163 --> 01:37:07.791
Come on, Charlie.
Come on, Charlie.

01:37:38.496 --> 01:37:41.227
~ We are the champions, my friend ~

01:37:43.569 --> 01:37:46.503
~And we'll keep on fighting ~

01:37:46.571 --> 01:37:50.405
~ 'Til the end ~

01:37:50.508 --> 01:37:58.243
~ We are the champions ~

01:37:58.350 --> 01:38:01.807

~ We are the champions, my friend ~

01:38:15.834 --> 01:38:18.996
~And we'll keep on fighting ~

01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:21.699
~ 'Til the end ~

01:38:21.773 --> 01:38:23.707
~ Oh, we are the champions ~

01:38:23.775 --> 01:38:25.675
Thank you, Hans.

01:38:25.744 --> 01:38:28.542
I'm proud of you, Gordon.

01:38:28.614 --> 01:38:30.343
~ We are the champions ~

01:38:30.415 --> 01:38:34.443

01:38:39.391 --> 01:38:42.053

Ducks, Ducks, Ducks,

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:03.075
Look, don't take
any bad dives, okay?

01:39:04.217 --> 01:39:06.117
Just remember,

01:39:06.219 --> 01:39:09.244
keep your head up, man.

01:39:09.321 --> 01:39:11.255
Cake-eater.

01:39:16.829 --> 01:39:19.593
Remember, strength,
not concentration.

01:39:19.666 --> 01:39:21.600
Right.

01:39:21.668 --> 01:39:24.603
And for God's sakes, soft hands.

01:39:24.671 --> 01:39:27.970
Right. Anything else?

01:39:28.074 --> 01:39:30.975
Yeah. Have fun
out there, coach.

01:39:35.515 --> 01:39:38.450
I must be crazy.
A tryout with the minors.

01:39:38.518 --> 01:39:41.784
I'm gonna be goin' up
against kids half my age.

01:39:41.855 --> 01:39:44.948
Just have a good tryout, Gordon.
One step at a time.

01:39:45.024 --> 01:39:47.618
Yeah, you're right.

01:39:58.706 --> 01:40:00.969
Bye. I'll call you
when I get there.

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:03.304
Banks is first in line next!

01:40:08.549 --> 01:40:10.608
Hey, Ducks!

01:40:10.684 --> 01:40:13.482
No matter what happens,
we'll see you next season.

01:40:13.554 --> 01:40:18.149
We got a title to defend.

01:40:22.329 --> 01:40:27.028

~And bad mistakes ~

01:42:12.588 --> 01:42:15.078
