WEBVTT

00:03.836 --> 00:06.171
- In four short months,
I had evolved.

00:06.173 --> 00:08.173
I'd gone from "that girl
who tried to kill herself"

00:08.175 --> 00:11.810
To "that girl who
had a date on new year's eve."

00:11.812 --> 00:13.078
You want another chance?

00:13.080 --> 00:14.279
- I won't screw up again.

00:14.281 --> 00:15.180
- I came with jake.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.649
- But you can stay with me. -

00:17.651 --> 00:19.218
I chose jake, and now
we can't be alone

00:19.220 --> 00:21.453
Without matty tagging along,
trying to tempt me.

00:21.455 --> 00:22.955
The whole situation is weird.

00:22.957 --> 00:24.156
- I hate to admit this,

00:24.158 --> 00:25.591
But matty might be trying
to home wreck you.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.659
- Nice job, mckibben.
- What?

00:27.661 --> 00:29.995
- You are totally
sabotaging them.

00:29.997 --> 00:32.231
- Ricky's the missed
connection!

00:32.232 --> 00:33.866
- He's her what?

00:33.868 --> 00:35.901
[door squeaks]

00:35.903 --> 00:37.369
- Ricky?

00:37.371 --> 00:39.204
- Ricky!

00:39.206 --> 00:40.339
- You really are the fool.

00:40.341 --> 00:43.275
Ask matty--he had
a piece of your hamilton pie

00:43.277 --> 00:44.376
Long before you did.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.079
- Okay, mckibben,
time to come clean.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.580
- Please don't do this.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.416
- Uhh!
[all gasp]

00:50.418 --> 00:51.650
- I [bleep] your girlfriend!

00:51.652 --> 00:53.085
- We've decided
not to let

00:53.087 --> 00:54.186
A girl
come between us.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.421
- So you need to choose--

00:55.423 --> 00:56.288
Him or me.

00:56.290 --> 00:59.491
- Maybe the timing's
finally right.

00:59.493 --> 01:00.592
- We're going to europe!

01:00.594 --> 01:01.927
- Too late.
The trip's full.

01:01.929 --> 01:03.395
I took the last slot.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.763
Both:
I made out with jake.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.965
- You have a trip.
I'm not going.

01:06.967 --> 01:07.633
My spot is yours.

01:07.635 --> 01:10.102
I finally got
what I really wanted.

01:10.104 --> 01:15.374
But I wasn't sure
it was what I needed.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.175
- Junior year.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.277
Junior year was like the
Thursday night of high school,

01:18.279 --> 01:19.945
And the beginning
of the end.

01:19.947 --> 01:20.846
I was growing up.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.549
Victoria had finally
let me in on her secret:

01:23.551 --> 01:26.318
Padding.
Lots and lots of padding.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.788
But, underneath it,
I was actually blossoming.

01:29.790 --> 01:30.556
Changing.

01:30.558 --> 01:31.957
And the thought of it
made me--

01:31.959 --> 01:33.392
- Nervous?

01:33.394 --> 01:34.426
- No. Yeah.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.328
Probably just
first-day jitters, right?

01:36.330 --> 01:37.629
- What are you nervous about?

01:37.631 --> 01:38.730
- I don't know.

01:38.732 --> 01:39.565
But I did.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.533
I hadn't seen
tamara or ming all summer.

01:41.535 --> 01:44.303
Either they were out of town
or I was,

01:44.305 --> 01:47.606
And when I wasn't...

01:47.608 --> 01:49.942
I was wrapped up
in my cocoon,

01:49.944 --> 01:51.877
My cocoon
of matty.

01:51.879 --> 01:52.845
[cell phone buzzing]

01:52.847 --> 01:56.515
I had disappeared
into my relationship,

01:56.517 --> 02:00.419
And forgotten
about my friends.

02:00.421 --> 02:00.919
- Ready?

02:00.921 --> 02:02.588
- Can't we just
stay here?

02:02.590 --> 02:04.790
- Nope.
It is time to be--

02:04.792 --> 02:06.525
- Independent study.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.526
That's the elective
I signed up for,

02:08.529 --> 02:10.628
Not creative writing.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.798
Can you fix it?

02:12.800 --> 02:15.601
- What do you think
about the metamorphosis?

02:15.603 --> 02:17.469
Pretty chic, huh?

02:17.471 --> 02:18.704
Love is a game changer.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.572
- Is she still
hung up on ricky?

02:20.574 --> 02:21.673
- [laughs]
good one.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.942
Although I wonder
if ricky has anything to do

02:23.944 --> 02:26.612
With why tamara and jake
aren't online official.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.313
But any day now.
Right?

02:28.315 --> 02:29.615
- Right.
I knew that.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.649
But I didn't.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.518
I didn't know anything
about tamara's life.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.520
What about you?
Where have you been all summer?

02:34.522 --> 02:37.089
- Working for my grandparents
in moorpark.

02:37.091 --> 02:39.358
It's like the pit
of the earth.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.526
But I learned mandarin.

02:40.528 --> 02:41.860
- You finally
speak chinese?

02:41.862 --> 02:46.598
- Ix-nay
on the chinese-ay.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.600
Mafia is everywhere,

02:48.602 --> 02:50.936
And they can't know
what I know.

02:50.938 --> 02:53.405
It's all about
the long play.

02:53.407 --> 02:53.939
Gotta go!

02:53.941 --> 02:56.041
I'm gonna get the deets
on the new 'do.

02:56.043 --> 02:59.344
- Normally, we spend hours
debating a simple trim,

02:59.346 --> 03:00.946
And suddenly,
she had hacked and whacked

03:00.948 --> 03:01.947
Without even a text.

03:01.949 --> 03:04.650
Maybe it wasn't me
that had forgotten my friends.

03:04.652 --> 03:07.519
Maybe it was my friends
that had forgotten me.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.120
- My girl.

03:08.122 --> 03:10.422
- Thankfully,
some things never changed.

03:10.424 --> 03:16.461
- <i>Su cabella</i>
<i>es muy bonita.</i>

03:16.463 --> 03:18.497
- Or they did.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.537
[knocking at door]

03:25.539 --> 03:26.171
- Yeah.

03:26.173 --> 03:28.774
- It's your girl.
- "t."

03:28.776 --> 03:29.841
Oh.
"j."

03:29.843 --> 03:31.343
Thought you were
my new girl.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.377
She was going
to stop by

03:32.379 --> 03:34.379
To help me pick
the best pics from europe

03:34.381 --> 03:35.581
To tag before class.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.116
[scoffs]
she is such a character.

03:38.118 --> 03:40.552
You know, sometimes, I just
can't get her off the phone.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.455
- You guys talk on the phone?
- Like it's my job.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.489
Which it sort of is,

03:44.491 --> 03:46.391
Since she's listed
as my sister on facebook.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.893
So whatcha need?
- Help.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.361
I've been put
in creative writing

03:49.363 --> 03:50.762
For my elective.
- And?

03:50.764 --> 03:52.564
- And I didn't sign up for it.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.166
- No, I did.
- Why?

03:54.168 --> 03:55.534
- Because
it's an excellent class,

03:55.536 --> 03:58.804
And very hard
to get into.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.607
Mr. Hart reads a lot
of submissions every year.

04:01.609 --> 04:02.841
And he's a very tough customer

04:02.843 --> 04:04.176
When it comes
to the written word.

04:04.178 --> 04:07.145
- But I didn't write a word.
- He read your blog.

04:07.147 --> 04:10.649
- But my blog is private.
- Ha! Right.

04:10.651 --> 04:11.950
But when it wasn't,

04:11.952 --> 04:13.919
I printed out
a copy or two.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.087
You know,
for work and home.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.822
Sometimes I need
a good, angsty soap

04:16.824 --> 04:17.755
To put me to sleep.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.658
Oh, and I might have
sent one to my mom,

04:19.660 --> 04:22.094
Who may or may not
be team matty.

04:22.096 --> 04:25.764
- You can tell her that he is
now firmly on team jenna.

04:25.766 --> 04:26.832
- Excellent word play.

04:26.834 --> 04:30.669
See, you are totally going
to meet the challenges

04:30.671 --> 04:31.703
Of mr. Hart's class.

04:31.705 --> 04:35.040
- I don't want a challenge.

04:35.042 --> 04:35.907
- Wake up, jenna.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.075
This is your junior year,

04:37.077 --> 04:40.812
And it is time
to evolve, change.

04:40.814 --> 04:41.980
Fine, you want
to be a wuss?

04:41.982 --> 04:43.849
I'll sign you up
for something wimpy,

04:43.851 --> 04:44.983
Like drama.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.318
Going once...

04:46.320 --> 04:47.853
- Maybe valerie
had a point.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.021
- Going twice--

04:49.023 --> 04:50.155
- Maybe I needed
a change.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.556
I'll stay
in creative writing.

04:51.558 --> 04:54.493
- Good.
Now, you're gonna need this.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.395
Mr. Hart can be
a real ball buster.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.030
- Apparently,
so could my conscience.

04:58.032 --> 05:00.565
It was time to see
if my friendship with tamara

05:00.567 --> 05:03.735
Had changed
along with her hair.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.504
I can't believe
you cut it.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.004
- I know.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.674
But after being abroad and
seeing how the other half lives,

05:08.676 --> 05:10.609
I am forever
a different person.

05:10.611 --> 05:11.843
Europeans are amazeballs.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.111
As in,
stress the "balls,"

05:13.113 --> 05:14.746
'cause that's
what they smell like.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.081
But they call it "musk,"

05:16.083 --> 05:18.950
Which is just so sexy,
you know?

05:18.952 --> 05:19.851
- No.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.586
- Well, it's hard to explain
unless you've been there,

05:21.588 --> 05:25.624
But the euros just have
this <i>je ne sais quoi.</i>

05:25.626 --> 05:26.191
French.

05:26.193 --> 05:27.592
It's like
an individuality thing,

05:27.594 --> 05:29.027
Which is the mantra
of this year.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.128
I want
to be original.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.496
And although
I'm not brave enough

05:31.498 --> 05:32.464
To roll
without roll-on,

05:32.466 --> 05:33.899
I thought that changing
the flair of my hair

05:33.901 --> 05:34.900
Was the next best thing.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.002
- So you really put a lot
of thought into it.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.503
- Actually,
there was no thought.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.604
It was totally impulsive.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.006
That's why
I love the spaniards.

05:41.008 --> 05:44.209
Everything is so <i>sera sera,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

05:44.211 --> 05:45.010
- Not really.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.044
- Well,
if you did know,

05:46.046 --> 05:48.013
You know know that they are
a people of spontaneity,

05:48.015 --> 05:50.182
Which is also something
that I want to embrace.

05:50.184 --> 05:53.051
I am letting go of having
to define things in my life,

05:53.053 --> 05:56.021
Like my style
or my relationship.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.756
I don't need
to d.T.R. Anymore.

05:57.758 --> 05:58.690
- But I still did,

05:58.692 --> 06:00.225
And I needed to know
if we were still besties.

06:00.227 --> 06:01.793
Which is really cool,
and I actually have

06:01.795 --> 06:03.028
A lot of questions
about that,

06:03.030 --> 06:04.596
Because there's something
I want to share.

06:04.598 --> 06:07.799
- What's happening?

06:07.801 --> 06:08.800
Walk with me.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.002
I think
I need support.

06:11.004 --> 06:11.903
And a tampon.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.705
- [gasps]
aunt to the flow.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.906
You finally
got it?

06:14.908 --> 06:15.974
- Yes.
- And I did, too.

06:15.976 --> 06:19.511
I was getting
that I was being sidelined...

06:19.513 --> 06:20.178
And left behind.

06:20.180 --> 06:23.749
- Ming, this is
so <i>tres magnifique.</i>

06:23.751 --> 06:25.050
You're a woman.

06:25.052 --> 06:25.817
- Hooray.

06:25.819 --> 06:28.253
- And we're all
cycling together.

06:28.255 --> 06:30.756
The italians
call it <i>simpatico.</i>

06:30.758 --> 06:31.923
Or maybe
it was the spanish.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.658
Either way,
someone cute said it.

06:33.660 --> 06:34.226
Here.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.160
- It's not my time.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.661
- Oh, europe must have
thrown us off.

06:36.663 --> 06:39.030
- Europe wasn't the only thing
throwing us off.

06:39.032 --> 06:41.032
Our lack of connection was,
too.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.601
Suddenly,
my stomach felt...

06:42.603 --> 06:45.704
- [retching]
- unsettled.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.506
[toilet flushing]

06:54.147 --> 06:56.281
- That was bizarro ungaro.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.617
[toilet flushing]

06:58.619 --> 07:00.719
- What'd I just miss?
- Sadie.

07:00.721 --> 07:01.753
Someone stole her tongue.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.089
- And replaced it
with a bun...

07:04.091 --> 07:04.890
In the oven.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.024
Rumor has it,
she's pregnant.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.627
- Change was everywhere,
even for sadie.

07:08.629 --> 07:09.928
And apparently,
the entire school

07:09.930 --> 07:12.731
Was trying to confirm
the father of the sperm.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.800
- Ricky schwartz.
It's his.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.068
- What the hell
am I supposed to do

07:17.070 --> 07:18.603
With ricky's credit card?

07:18.605 --> 07:20.739
- He said to buy something nice,
anything you want.

07:20.741 --> 07:21.339
He loves you.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.708
- How many times
do I have to tell you

07:23.710 --> 07:25.844
To tell him
we're done?

07:25.846 --> 07:27.813
I have bigger fish to fry
than him.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.848
Are you going
to eat your pickle?

07:29.850 --> 07:31.650
- You're eating
a lot.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.051
- So?
- You miss him.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.152
I know
he misses you.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.787
That's why he came in
to get froyo for you

07:35.789 --> 07:36.922
Every day
at my shop.

07:36.924 --> 07:37.889
- It was a waste.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.091
[crunch]
like his life.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.561
- But now you have a life
that isn't a waste.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.262
- What?
- Baby--sadie.

07:44.264 --> 07:45.697
He's trying
to make it up to you,

07:45.699 --> 07:47.199
And I don't know
what to tell him

07:47.201 --> 07:48.600
Every time
that he cries.

07:48.602 --> 07:51.136
- Tell him to die.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.238
God, I need
to puke.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.172
- That's your lunch?

07:54.174 --> 07:55.307
- The french
keep it light,

07:55.309 --> 07:57.309
Which is why they can eat
whatever they want.

07:57.311 --> 07:58.376
It is all
about moderation.

07:58.378 --> 08:01.213
- What tamara needed to do
was moderate the euro brag.

08:01.215 --> 08:02.113
Where's ming?

08:02.115 --> 08:03.415
- She's eating
with the mafia today.

08:03.417 --> 08:04.950
She's trying
to reconnect with them,

08:04.952 --> 08:06.117
Since she's been gone
all summer.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.252
- Speaking of reconnecting,

08:07.254 --> 08:09.020
There's actually something
that I wanted to tell you.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.990
- T.T.
- [gasps] jacques.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.831
Both: Pixelize us?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.132
- Mm.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.368
[camera shutter clicks]

08:23.370 --> 08:24.836
- Oh, not my fave.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.304
Show jenna
our selects from the trip,

08:26.306 --> 08:29.007
And see which ones
she likes best.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.675
- Uhh.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.379
- It would be hard
to choose.

08:34.381 --> 08:37.082
- Personally, I think the one
in front of the trevi fountain

08:37.083 --> 08:38.416
Encapsulates
the whole experience.

08:38.418 --> 08:40.852
That's the one we should use
for the profile pic

08:40.854 --> 08:41.820
On our page.

08:41.822 --> 08:42.721
- Wait, "our" page?

08:42.722 --> 08:44.356
Both: We created
our own facebook page.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.992
[both laugh]

08:48.160 --> 08:49.961
Both: <i>Je t'aime.</i>

08:52.365 --> 08:54.065
- Jacques,
we're being rude.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.835
Jenna was just about
to tell us something.

08:56.837 --> 08:57.469
Both: Tell us.

08:57.471 --> 08:59.304
- "us" was not
who I wanted to tell.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.640
- I'm in creative writing.

09:01.642 --> 09:02.374
- With mr. Hart?

09:02.376 --> 09:03.808
Ugh.
He's a sadist.

09:03.810 --> 09:06.144
- But not you.
You're a lover.

09:06.146 --> 09:10.115
- Oh, <i>mi amor.</i>
<i>Both:</i> <i>Je t'aime.</i>

09:10.117 --> 09:11.449
- I was starting
to feel floored

09:11.451 --> 09:13.018
By how much
I was ignored.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.287
But if flying under the radar
was my new forte,

09:15.289 --> 09:19.758
Then being invisible was going
to have its benefits in class.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.726
[bell ringing]

09:21.728 --> 09:23.028
- You!

09:23.030 --> 09:29.200
Who the hell
do you think you are?

09:29.202 --> 09:30.435
- What do you mean?

09:30.437 --> 09:33.204
- I mean,
who are you?

09:33.206 --> 09:34.272
- A student
in your class.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.308
- Wrong.
Only I can assess that.

09:36.310 --> 09:40.312
Okay, everybody look
to your left.

09:40.314 --> 09:42.213
Now everybody
look to your right.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.515
The people sitting
on either side of you

09:43.517 --> 09:46.518
Will not be there
at the end of the year.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.185
Yes?

09:47.187 --> 09:48.753
- That would mean that no one
would be in class.

09:48.755 --> 09:51.423
- And that's exactly
what happened in 2009.

09:51.425 --> 09:52.123
Yeah?

09:52.125 --> 09:53.158
- Can I use the bathroom?

09:53.160 --> 09:54.292
- Can you?
Probably.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.226
May you?
No.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.361
There's no breaks
in this life.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.430
There's
no breaks in this class.

09:58.432 --> 09:59.331
If you have to be human,

09:59.333 --> 10:01.066
Do it before you walk
through my door

10:01.068 --> 10:02.100
Or after you leave.

10:02.102 --> 10:05.303
Because while my name
might be mr. Hart,

10:05.305 --> 10:06.338
I don't have one.

10:06.340 --> 10:09.074
Everybody understand?

10:09.076 --> 10:10.542
Now, who are my quitters?

10:10.544 --> 10:13.678
Leave now before you suffer
the consequences of staying.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.348
You? Let's go.
Go, go, go, go!

10:16.350 --> 10:19.317
Go, go, go!
Go, go, go!

10:19.319 --> 10:25.390
Take her with you.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.758
[whispers] hi.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.394
Are you a crier?

10:29.396 --> 10:30.528
Yeah.

10:30.530 --> 10:32.263
You know
what rule number one is?

10:32.265 --> 10:33.498
There's no crying
in this class!

10:33.500 --> 10:35.266
Now go!
Go, go, go, go, go!

10:35.268 --> 10:38.003
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go!

10:44.377 --> 10:49.347
For everyone else who's here,
let's get down to brass tacks.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.616
You all think you know
who you are.

10:51.618 --> 10:53.685
I don't care who you are.

10:53.687 --> 10:57.122
I want to know,

10:57.124 --> 11:02.293
Who do you want
to be?

11:02.295 --> 11:05.697
Now, some of you may think
that you're good writers,

11:05.699 --> 11:06.931
'cause you write
witty little musings

11:06.933 --> 11:09.267
About taking a dump
on your facebook wall,

11:09.269 --> 11:15.540
Or you whine about your feelings
on your blog.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.675
[giggles]

11:16.677 --> 11:20.211
[slaps desk] <i>that</i> is not
being a writer.

11:20.213 --> 11:24.549
Writing is about
conquering your [bleep] fears.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.418
It's about putting
onto paper

11:26.420 --> 11:33.091
The thing that
you are most afraid to share.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.727
Now,
for your first assignment,

11:35.729 --> 11:38.329
I want you all to write
about your greatest fear.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.864
And like the little pussies
you are,

11:39.866 --> 11:43.234
Don't worry
about putting your name on it.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.770
Just write it down.

11:46.505 --> 11:48.406
Okay, before we dissect
all this bull[bleep],

11:48.408 --> 11:51.543
I need you guys to look at those
release forms I passed out.

11:51.545 --> 11:52.911
I want you
to bring those home tonight,

11:52.913 --> 11:54.646
Get your parents
to sign them,

11:54.648 --> 11:56.314
Or don't come back.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.882
- This guy's a trip.
- And a nut.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.818
Maybe my parents
would forgo their permission

11:59.820 --> 12:01.753
So I could be released
to take drama instead.

12:01.755 --> 12:05.223
- Okay, so let's see what kind
of losers we have this year.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.057
"I'm afraid of failing."

12:06.059 --> 12:07.792
Well, you don't have
to be afraid anymore,

12:07.794 --> 12:08.993
'cause if that's
the best you got,

12:08.995 --> 12:10.228
You've already failed.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.364
Get out of my class.

12:13.366 --> 12:13.998
Next one.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.634
"I'm afraid
of my suicidal thoughts."

12:16.636 --> 12:21.439
Do we have a potential
hemingway in the class?

12:21.441 --> 12:22.440
Probably not.

12:22.442 --> 12:23.575
Oh, here's a nice one.

12:23.577 --> 12:28.446
"I'm afraid
I masturbate too much."

12:28.448 --> 12:30.682
You do.
Don't be so obvious.

12:30.684 --> 12:33.284
"I'm debating my fear
of life and death,

12:33.286 --> 12:37.555
And wondering if
it should be my choice."

12:37.557 --> 12:40.325
I guess we have a lot of
suicidal tendencies here, huh?

12:40.327 --> 12:41.860
Which might
be a good thing,

12:41.862 --> 12:43.928
If you're as cliche
as your fears.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.398
Now, does anyone want
to go for the gold

12:47.400 --> 12:49.434
And really own your fears?

12:49.436 --> 12:52.003
Ah, my first suck up.
And you are?

12:52.005 --> 12:52.837
- Collin.

12:52.839 --> 12:53.972
I'm not admitting
to anything.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.707
I just wanted to point out
that you were wrong

12:55.709 --> 12:57.509
About the one
that's debating life and death

12:57.511 --> 12:59.811
And whether it should
be a choice.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.380
That's not about suicide.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.349
- So what's it about,
professor?

13:04.351 --> 13:07.519
- Being pregnant.

13:07.521 --> 13:09.454
[bell ringing]

13:09.456 --> 13:12.190
- For once, I felt
a connection to sadie.

13:12.192 --> 13:12.891
If the rumors were true,

13:12.893 --> 13:14.626
She was about to be branded
and left behind

13:14.628 --> 13:18.229
As her friends moved
in a different life direction,

13:18.231 --> 13:19.230
Like me.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.198
Sadie?

13:20.200 --> 13:20.865
- Yeah?

13:20.867 --> 13:23.368
- I just want to say
that whatever's going on,

13:23.370 --> 13:26.471
Just know that the universe
doesn't give us

13:26.473 --> 13:27.672
What we can't handle.

13:27.674 --> 13:30.341
- Really?
- Absolutely.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.710
- What do you know
about life, jenna?

13:32.712 --> 13:35.780
Nothing.
You've experienced nothing.

13:35.782 --> 13:37.782
All you know is
how to braid your hair.

13:37.784 --> 13:40.318
So if you want
to throw a pity party,

13:40.320 --> 13:42.020
Do it for yourself.

13:42.022 --> 13:42.754
You're lame.

13:42.756 --> 13:46.724
And that is never going
to change.

13:46.726 --> 13:49.894
Oh.
You're welcome.

13:49.896 --> 13:51.963
- So maybe sadie
was still the same.

13:51.965 --> 13:56.935
Or maybe
it was the hormones.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.703
- As requested,
I have brought you home,

13:58.705 --> 14:00.672
And walked you
to the door.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.240
Do you want me
to come in?

14:02.242 --> 14:05.276
- No, you're going
to be late for practice.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.077
Better go.

14:06.079 --> 14:10.548
- Then you're going to have
to give me back my hand.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.649
Everything okay?

14:11.651 --> 14:12.283
- Yeah.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.752
No.
It's been a weird day.

14:14.754 --> 14:17.188
I'm starting to feel
like I made a mistake

14:17.190 --> 14:18.656
Not going away
this summer.

14:18.658 --> 14:19.357
- Who needs europe

14:19.359 --> 14:20.925
When you could have
the same experience

14:20.927 --> 14:25.897
Buying a "beer of the world"
sampler at trader joe's?

14:25.899 --> 14:27.866
- I just feel
like a different person,

14:27.868 --> 14:30.068
And I'm scared.

14:30.070 --> 14:30.902
- Of what?

14:30.904 --> 14:33.671
- Being alone,
forgotten.

14:33.673 --> 14:37.976
- Hey, you are never going
to be alone.

14:37.978 --> 14:41.112
Okay? You have me.
Mm-hmm.

14:41.114 --> 14:44.282
- Never say never.
- [whispers] never.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.851
- Mom, I'll call you later.
Jenna just got home.

14:46.853 --> 14:50.755
Yes, I promise not
to wrinkle my forehead anymore.

14:50.757 --> 14:53.758
No, I am not
wrinkling it now.

14:53.760 --> 14:57.328
Jenna, am I
wrinkling my forehead?

14:57.330 --> 14:58.329
- Mm-hmm.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.765
- Jenna said no.
Love you, bye.

15:00.767 --> 15:05.670
Your nana is the one who
makes me wrinkle my forehead.

15:05.672 --> 15:06.905
Uh, where are you going?

15:06.907 --> 15:08.139
I want to hear
about your day.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.875
- Not much to tell.
- But you're a junior.

15:10.877 --> 15:13.645
Didn't it feel
even a little bit special?

15:13.647 --> 15:15.079
- Nope.

15:15.081 --> 15:15.914
- How's tamara?

15:15.916 --> 15:17.649
Did she have a good time
in europe?

15:17.651 --> 15:18.249
- I guess.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.918
We didn't really
get a chance to talk.

15:19.920 --> 15:20.919
I take that back.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.787
We had
a couple conversations,

15:22.789 --> 15:24.689
But they were
pretty one-sided.

15:24.691 --> 15:25.857
She looks good, so--

15:25.859 --> 15:27.926
- That's all
that happened today?

15:27.928 --> 15:32.230
- There is a girl in my class
who might be pregnant.

15:34.366 --> 15:37.635
- Do I know this girl?

15:37.637 --> 15:39.170
- Yeah.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.204
- Do I like her?

15:40.206 --> 15:44.442
- Well, it depends
on the day.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.478
- Well, you should
be nice to her.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.047
A girl
in that situation

15:49.049 --> 15:51.049
Needs all the friends
she can get.

15:51.051 --> 15:54.118
- Can I go now?
- Mm-hmm.

16:10.769 --> 16:12.837
- You must have been
reading my mind.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.172
I was just
about to call you.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.040
- Really?
'cause I've been worried.

16:16.042 --> 16:16.741
- Me too.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.910
We have never gone this long
without talking.

16:18.912 --> 16:21.846
- Which is my fault, and I
should have called sooner, but--

16:21.848 --> 16:23.381
- He's not into me.
- What?

16:23.383 --> 16:25.750
- It's been three hours.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.151
Jake and I
are in constant contact,

16:27.153 --> 16:28.052
Unless we're sleeping.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.487
Matty must have
said something to you.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.823
Tell me.
I am a big girl.

16:31.825 --> 16:32.957
[line beeping]

16:32.959 --> 16:36.995
Hold that thought.

16:36.997 --> 16:37.495
[click]

16:37.497 --> 16:39.897
I am such a geek
of a freak.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.399
It's jake.
Call you later.

16:41.401 --> 16:44.435
- Oka--uh...

16:44.437 --> 16:46.104
Bye.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.243
With so many things
changing,

16:52.245 --> 16:54.412
Some things
were still the same.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.047
Once again,
I was blogging,

16:56.049 --> 16:59.050
Or whining, if you will,
about my woes.

16:59.052 --> 17:02.153
But there was something
that I didn't want to admit,

17:02.155 --> 17:03.855
And yet,
desperate to share.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.824
It had nothing to do
with forgetting my friends

17:06.826 --> 17:07.625
Or them forgetting me.

17:07.627 --> 17:10.194
It was something forgotten
one summer night,

17:10.195 --> 17:14.198
A momentary mistake
that I had filed under denial,

17:14.200 --> 17:16.968
A secret
that could change everything.

17:16.970 --> 17:20.271
Because I was the one
debating a fear

17:20.272 --> 17:21.172
Of life and death,

17:21.174 --> 17:25.576
And I was the one wondering
if it should be my choice.

17:25.578 --> 17:34.252
Because I didn't know
what I would choose...

17:34.254 --> 17:37.488
- Did the condom break?
- Well, um--

17:37.490 --> 17:41.559
- Did you even
use one?

17:41.561 --> 17:43.795
- No.
It was just one time.

17:43.797 --> 17:46.564
- It only takes
one time.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.565
- I wasn't thinking.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.500
I was just caught up...

17:49.502 --> 17:53.538
- In the moment?
I know.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.640
I've been there.

17:59.678 --> 18:01.312
- I'm too nervous.
I can't read it.

18:01.314 --> 18:02.547
- Okay,
don't be afraid.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.315
If you're pregnant,
chances are,

18:04.317 --> 18:06.117
You'll only be nauseous
for a month.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.819
- Ugh, a month?
- Or three.

18:07.821 --> 18:09.887
But the delivery
happens lickety-split.

18:09.889 --> 18:12.690
Unless it gets stuck
in your underdeveloped hips,

18:12.692 --> 18:14.725
And then it could
take much longer.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.661
But you'll only have to sit
on a donut pillow

18:16.663 --> 18:17.695
For a couple
of weeks,

18:17.697 --> 18:18.696
Which is totally okay,

18:18.698 --> 18:22.767
Because you probably won't
want to eat solids for a while.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.703
It's hard to poop.

18:25.705 --> 18:30.208
- Oh, god.
- But a baby is so amazing.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.275
Once you get
some sleep.

18:31.277 --> 18:32.844
God, I think
the sleep deprivation

18:32.846 --> 18:33.945
Was worse
than the delivery.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.713
I couldn't see straight
for months.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.248
I really shouldn't
have been driving

18:37.250 --> 18:38.616
With an infant
in the car.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.785
- Mom,
you are not helping.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.220
- I'm sorry, honey.

18:42.222 --> 18:42.987
Don't panic.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.655
If this is
history repeating itself,

18:44.657 --> 18:47.458
Then I will support
whatever you decide,

18:47.460 --> 18:51.295
And we will get
through this together.

18:51.297 --> 18:54.899
- There is no decision,
mom.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.535
I'm here
because of you.

18:57.537 --> 19:00.238
And if this is history
repeating itself,

19:00.240 --> 19:06.677
Then this baby is going
to be here because of me.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.914
Are you going
to pass out?

19:09.916 --> 19:11.516
- I might.

19:11.518 --> 19:15.486
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.623
Oh, my god.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.291
You know what's funny?

19:20.293 --> 19:20.825
- What?

19:20.827 --> 19:22.894
- Last year,
after you found out

19:22.896 --> 19:24.395
That I wrote the letter,

19:24.397 --> 19:26.297
I was worried
that once you left home,

19:26.299 --> 19:27.431
You would never
come back.

19:27.433 --> 19:30.468
And now,
with a baby,

19:30.470 --> 19:32.303
You'll never leave.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.237
- Mom!

19:33.239 --> 19:33.871
- I'm kidding.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.040
You can leave
any time you want.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.442
And I'll babysit.

19:38.444 --> 19:40.478
Oh, my god.

19:40.480 --> 19:44.315
We're having a baby?

19:44.317 --> 19:46.350
[both screaming]

19:46.352 --> 19:50.688
Okay.
Okay.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.858
We are not
having a baby.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.661
[both scream]
- I'm not pregnant.

19:56.663 --> 19:57.795
- I never said
you were.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.330
- Then why did
your mother call me

19:59.332 --> 20:01.999
To recommend
a good prenatal vitamin?

20:02.001 --> 20:05.636
- Because you're going
to have a baby...Someday.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.238
Okay,
I was worried.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.039
People have been talking,

20:08.041 --> 20:09.674
And you've been
eating a lot,

20:09.676 --> 20:10.942
And throwing up, and--

20:10.944 --> 20:11.976
- And so what?

20:11.978 --> 20:14.345
I've been
under a lot of stress

20:14.347 --> 20:15.580
And full
of anxiety.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.448
- About ricky?
- No!

20:17.450 --> 20:19.750
[bleep] ricky.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.652
I'm broke, okay?

20:21.654 --> 20:23.454
My parents
lost all their money,

20:23.456 --> 20:24.589
And if anyone
finds out,

20:24.591 --> 20:28.926
I might have to go
to another school.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.695
- Do you want me
to tell ricky?

20:30.697 --> 20:34.065
- Ricky is dead to me.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.866
- That makes
two of us.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.668
Jake and I
d.T.R.'d last night.

20:37.670 --> 20:41.472
- I thought you weren't about
defining anything this year.

20:41.474 --> 20:42.406
- I was posturing.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.941
I am way too self-absorbed
to be <i>laissez-faire.</i>

20:43.943 --> 20:45.343
And, honestly,
I was just so afraid

20:45.345 --> 20:47.478
That jake and I were never going
to french outside of France

20:47.480 --> 20:50.381
That I was pretending I didn't
need to be commit-legit.

20:50.383 --> 20:51.382
But who am I kidding?

20:51.384 --> 20:52.650
I was totes
in secret spiral city

20:52.652 --> 20:54.652
Until I knew
nothing was going to change.

20:54.654 --> 20:55.720
- I know the feeling.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.922
- "j," I'm sorry.
- For what?

20:57.924 --> 20:59.457
- I've been so up
in my own grill

20:59.459 --> 21:00.858
I've been totally m.I.A.
From you.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.660
And I forgot
to call you back last night.

21:02.662 --> 21:03.995
So tell me what you were
going to say.

21:03.997 --> 21:05.863
- It's no big deal.
- Tell me.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.565
- Seriously, it was
a false alarm.

21:07.567 --> 21:08.366
- Tell me.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.934
- Okay, but brace yourself,
because--

21:09.936 --> 21:11.035
[cell phone chimes]

21:11.037 --> 21:13.404
- [screaming]

21:13.406 --> 21:18.943
[cell phones chiming,
girls screaming]

21:18.945 --> 21:21.545
- It's awful, it's terrible,
it's true.

21:21.547 --> 21:25.750
Ricky schwartz
<i>es muerto.</i>

21:25.752 --> 21:28.653
He's dead.

21:35.193 --> 21:36.193
- Next, on <i>awkward...</i>

21:36.195 --> 21:37.295
- It's for a vigil, tonight.

21:37.297 --> 21:38.663
We're gonna pay tribute
to ricky.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.464
Or converse with the devil.

21:40.466 --> 21:41.699
- Vigil?
I love it.

21:41.701 --> 21:42.700
- Matty was yoloing.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.235
I'll just tell matty
about the scare,

21:44.237 --> 21:45.536
And we can be extra-careful.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.505
- Everyone just needs to
step off their sad bus

21:47.507 --> 21:48.939
While some of us
are actually mourning.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.542
- I'm not pregnant.
Totally thought I was.

21:51.544 --> 21:52.810
But I'm not.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.779
So what did I miss?
