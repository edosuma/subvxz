00:00.876 --> 00:02.544
ANNOUNCER: In the television
comedy world,

00:02.628 --> 00:04.379
the people are entertained
by two separate yet

00:04.463 --> 00:06.507
equally important
types of shows:

00:06.632 --> 00:08.258
traditional sitcoms
that get laughs

00:08.342 --> 00:09.676
out of everyday situations,

00:09.760 --> 00:11.136
like trying
to fix your own plumbing,

00:11.220 --> 00:13.430
or inviting two dates
to the same dance,

00:13.514 --> 00:15.974
and animated shows
that make jokes about farting.

00:16.058 --> 00:17.351
This is the latter.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.355
Aw, sorry,
I just farted.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.774
("Law & Order" theme plays)

00:34.451 --> 00:35.744
(inaudible)

00:35.827 --> 00:37.579
(Glenn mumbling)

00:54.096 --> 00:55.973
I'm glad you guys
could come tonight.

00:56.056 --> 00:59.059
Oh, Chris, honey,
we wouldn't miss your open house.

00:59.184 --> 01:02.229
You kids are
the most important thing in our lives.

01:02.312 --> 01:03.897
Oh, my God!
We forgot Meg.

01:03.981 --> 01:04.982
Don't worry about Meg.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.775
She's got everything
she needs in her room.

01:15.409 --> 01:19.121
(clattering)

01:19.413 --> 01:22.165
COACH: Most of the time,
the kids'll exercise out in the field.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.418
But if it's raining
or I'm hungover,

01:24.501 --> 01:26.211
They stay inside
and play dodgeball.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.630
Oh, I love dodgeball!
Heads up!

01:30.757 --> 01:33.010
And this week in Home Ec,
we're teaching your kids

01:33.093 --> 01:34.219
how to make bundt cake.

01:34.303 --> 01:36.597
I love bundt cake!
Heads up!

01:38.765 --> 01:40.601
MUSIC TEACHER: The school band
offers a wide variety

01:40.684 --> 01:42.102
of instruments
from the kettle drum

01:42.186 --> 01:43.187
to the trombone.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.147
I love the trombone!

01:45.439 --> 01:46.523
(gasps)

01:46.899 --> 01:50.277
(trombone playing)

01:58.452 --> 01:59.661
ALL: Wow!

01:59.786 --> 02:01.455
I know,
isn't he wonderful?

02:01.538 --> 02:02.915
He took lessons
in junior college.

02:02.998 --> 02:03.999
Heads up!

02:06.919 --> 02:08.253
I like meetin'
Chris' teachers.

02:08.337 --> 02:09.338
This ought to be
more interesting

02:09.421 --> 02:11.507
than that time
I met Ted Danson.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.593
Wow! Ted Danson
and Mary Steenburgen!

02:14.676 --> 02:16.553
Hey, always nice
to meet a fan.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.930
(thunder rumbling)

02:18.013 --> 02:19.890
Oh, shoot!
I forgot my umbrella.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.725
That's okay, honey.
Come on over here.

02:21.808 --> 02:22.976
Thanks, dear.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.853
Sometimes it's good
to be a freak.

02:24.937 --> 02:26.396
Hey, do you wanna
sleep together later?

02:26.480 --> 02:28.315
Oh... no.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.485
No, no.
Thanks, though.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.237
Good evening, parents.
I'm Ms. Clifton.

02:33.362 --> 02:34.363
I'd like for you to fill out

02:34.446 --> 02:36.573
these
contact information sheets.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.242
Now-- now, who would like
to pass them out?

02:38.325 --> 02:39.368
Oh, oh, oh,

02:39.451 --> 02:41.161
Ms. Clifton,
Ms. Clifton over here!

02:41.245 --> 02:43.330
Oh, oh, oh,
Ms. Clifton, Ms. Clifton,

02:43.413 --> 02:46.291
Ms. Clifton, Ms. Clifton,
Ms. Clifton, Ms. Clifton

02:46.375 --> 02:49.253
Ms. Clifton, Ms. Clifton,
Ms. Clifton, Ms. Clifton,

02:49.336 --> 02:50.546
Ms. Clifton, Ms. Clifton,

02:50.629 --> 02:52.422
Mmm, Mrs. Griffin.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.757
(groans)

02:55.050 --> 02:58.095
I-- I-- I'm sorry, will you all
please excuse me for a moment?

02:58.345 --> 03:00.138
ANNOUNCER:
Tonight's winning lottery numbers

03:00.222 --> 03:03.892
are 6, 21, 18, 7, 42.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.479
Oh, my God! I won!

03:07.563 --> 03:10.899
I'm free from all those
snot-nosed little bastards!

03:10.983 --> 03:12.568
(laughing)

03:12.651 --> 03:14.027
I'm free!

03:14.111 --> 03:15.863
(Ms. Clifton laughing)

03:17.865 --> 03:19.199
Is she coming back?

03:19.283 --> 03:20.325
I don't know.

03:20.492 --> 03:23.370
(audience laughter)

03:26.957 --> 03:29.042
I can't believe
Ms. Clifton's gone.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.003
Who's gonna
teach my class now?

03:31.086 --> 03:33.463
Brian, why don't you
teach Chris' class?

03:33.547 --> 03:35.924
You're very knowledgeable,
and the kids might knock you down

03:36.008 --> 03:37.551
a few pegs,
which'd be good for you.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.678
You know,
that is a terrific idea, Lois.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.638
I probably have a lot
to offer young people.

03:41.722 --> 03:42.848
Hah, what's he going
to teach them?

03:42.931 --> 03:45.767
How to lick the Dorito crumbs
from between the sofa cushions?

03:45.851 --> 03:47.811
Or how to leave
a dead bird on the carpet?

03:47.895 --> 03:49.646
That was a gift,
you bastard.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.523
That was a gift
for the family.

03:54.651 --> 03:57.863
Good morning, class. I'm your
substitute teacher, Brian Griffin.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.282
ALL: Good morning,
Mr. Griffin.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.534
(laughing)
Please, please, call me Brian.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.453
Mr. Griffin is my father.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.830
I thought
your father's name was Cocoa,

04:06.914 --> 04:08.624
and he was hit
by a milk truck!

04:08.749 --> 04:09.958
All right,
our goal here

04:10.042 --> 04:11.919
is to gain a command
of the English language.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.420
so you
can be successful writers

04:13.504 --> 04:15.339
like Ben Affleck
and Matt Damon.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.965
Ah, there. Finished.

04:17.049 --> 04:19.885
Good Will Hunting
by Matt Damon.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.262
Hey, uh, you think
we could put both our names on that?

04:22.346 --> 04:25.140
What? You've done nothing
but eat Breyer's and smoke pot

04:25.224 --> 04:26.433
for the last six months.

04:26.558 --> 04:29.144
Oh, that's ridicu--
Come on! I-- I helped.

04:29.228 --> 04:32.397
Oh, yeah? Okay, uh,
wr-- write a line. Just-- just right now,

04:32.481 --> 04:33.607
just pitch me
a line right now.

04:33.690 --> 04:34.691
Okay.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.193
(farts)
How about that?

04:36.276 --> 04:38.445
That wasn't a line.
You just farted.

04:38.695 --> 04:39.821
There anymore pot?

04:42.991 --> 04:47.704
So, how was your first day,
Mr. Kot-ter? (laughs)

04:47.788 --> 04:50.165
Yeah, Chris. What's it like
to have Brian as a teacher?

04:50.249 --> 04:51.250
It sucks!

04:51.333 --> 04:54.169
Mr. Griffin gave me an "F"
on my first assignment!

04:54.253 --> 04:56.213
What? An "F", Brian?

04:56.296 --> 04:57.673
After all Chris
has done for you?

04:57.881 --> 05:01.218
Ahhh... yeah, just kinda
pull it out. Yeah.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.303
You know, if dogs aren't
supposed to eat

05:03.428 --> 05:04.596
dental floss
outta the garbage,

05:04.680 --> 05:06.348
why do they make it
mint-flavored?

05:06.515 --> 05:08.225
Hey, hey, Chris,
when I was in school,

05:08.308 --> 05:10.477
you know what we used to do
when a teacher gave us a bad grade?

05:10.561 --> 05:12.229
-What?
-We'd egg his house.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.564
Come on!
Where's this bastard live?

05:13.647 --> 05:15.023
I'll show you!

05:16.525 --> 05:17.901
That's his house!

05:17.985 --> 05:19.027
(both laughing)

05:19.111 --> 05:20.904
-Take that!
-I got it!

05:20.988 --> 05:22.322
PETER: Take that, you bum!

05:22.447 --> 05:23.740
What the hell
are you doing?

05:23.824 --> 05:24.825
-Is that him?
-Yeah!

05:24.908 --> 05:26.076
Oh, crap!

05:29.538 --> 05:30.539
Hello, class.

05:30.622 --> 05:33.250
Mark Twain here,
filling in for Brian Griffin.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.460
I understand
you children read my book,

05:35.544 --> 05:37.421
The Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.798
-ALL: Yeah, read it.
-Now, who can tell me--

05:39.882 --> 05:41.383
Bobby, stop screwing around
back there!

05:41.466 --> 05:42.926
Who can tell me
the significance

05:43.010 --> 05:44.928
of the carpetbaggers
in my novel?

05:45.053 --> 05:46.972
Yeah, uh, they stood
for corruption and greed.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.515
That's exactly right.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.143
Just like
the presidency of James Garfield.

05:51.268 --> 05:52.895
(all laughing)

05:52.978 --> 05:53.979
He died in office.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.647
You kids are mighty smart.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.066
You must
have a powerful good teacher.

05:58.150 --> 06:02.404
Well, I gotta catch
my time steamboat back to the 1800s.

06:02.487 --> 06:06.116
(feet pattering)

06:06.200 --> 06:07.993
Hey, sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?

06:08.076 --> 06:10.120
Yeah!
Captain Crunch was here.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.164
Didn't you pass him
on the stairs?

06:12.247 --> 06:15.000
Well, I hope the rest of you kids
learned something today.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.668
ALL: Yeah.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.587
Good morning,
this is Principal Sloan.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.214
Mr. Griffin,
you've been reassigned.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.715
Please report
to Remedial English.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.759
STUDENTS: Huh?
-Reassigned? W-- C-- can I at least

06:23.842 --> 06:25.594
come down to your office
and talk to you about this?

06:25.677 --> 06:28.847
No, no, I'm afraid
I'm far too busy today.

06:28.972 --> 06:32.267
Esteban,
uh, mucho tension lower.

06:32.893 --> 06:36.188
Little lower. Lower.

06:36.563 --> 06:39.316
Lower. Lower--

06:39.399 --> 06:42.110
(in high voice)
On top of old smokey

06:42.194 --> 06:44.530
Gosh, I was really startin'
to like this job.

06:44.613 --> 06:46.823
It was nice interacting
with intelligent people.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.367
I usually hang out
with an idiot.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.118
Brian, Brian,
check it out.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.828
I made a water slide
in the house.

06:51.954 --> 06:54.498
Yay-- Aah aah, aah!

06:54.581 --> 06:56.458
(groaning)

06:56.625 --> 07:00.754
(continues groaning)
Ow!

07:00.838 --> 07:02.089
I'm not gonna
call the hospital

07:02.172 --> 07:05.634
because you won't
learn anything if I do.

07:05.717 --> 07:08.011
Well, kids,
I'll see you later.

07:09.471 --> 07:12.349
Pardon me,
is this first-period English?

07:13.767 --> 07:16.228
I'm your new teacher,
Mrs. Lockhart.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.777
Oh, my God. I'm in love.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.696
Watch out for the stairs!

07:25.779 --> 07:28.365
-(screams)
-(crashing)

07:37.624 --> 07:38.959
Good morning, class.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.587
ALL: Good morning,
Mrs. Lockhart.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.672
I graded your quizzes
from yesterday.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.507
Most of you did well.

07:45.591 --> 07:47.885
Some of you,
I think, can do better.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.720
What do you see here, Chris?

07:51.763 --> 07:53.056
Two "D"s and an "F."

07:59.688 --> 08:01.440
(music and noise)

08:03.525 --> 08:05.569
Uh, hi. I'm, uh, Mr. Griffin,

08:05.652 --> 08:07.487
but you can call me Brian.

08:07.613 --> 08:08.822
Mr. Griffin is my father.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.491
(gun fires)
Uh, well, has, uh,

08:11.575 --> 08:12.576
anybody read Huckleberry Finn?

08:12.659 --> 08:14.286
(gun fires)
Uh, all right, uh,

08:14.369 --> 08:15.746
how about we go around
the room,

08:15.829 --> 08:17.831
and everyone can say
a little something about themselves?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.833
Uh, let's start
with you there in the front.

08:19.917 --> 08:22.336
My name's Tim.
I'm 28 years young,

08:22.419 --> 08:23.670
and I love weed.

08:23.754 --> 08:26.924
My name is Carlos.
And beneath my tough exterior

08:27.007 --> 08:28.884
is a boy aching to learn.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.761
And beneath that
is a rapist.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.639
My name is Amanda,
and my water just broke.

08:33.722 --> 08:34.765
Oh, my God!

08:34.848 --> 08:36.183
Yo, it's my turn to deliver.

08:36.266 --> 08:37.267
Can I have this one?

08:37.351 --> 08:39.269
My mom keeps
givin' mine away.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.482
Dad, I need some advice.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.651
I need to know
how to get a girl to like me.

08:45.734 --> 08:48.070
Ah, Chris, buddy,
there's a million ways to do that.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.656
You just gotta do somethin' simple,
like Vincent van Gogh.

08:50.739 --> 08:53.283
Ooh, it's...
what is this?

08:53.408 --> 08:55.285
It's my ear.
Do you like it?

08:56.119 --> 08:57.120
Y-- you don't--
you don't like it.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.165
No, I like it.
But it's just-- Why your ear?

09:00.249 --> 09:03.627
-Because I love you.
-Well, at least this'll be a funny story

09:03.710 --> 09:04.753
to tell our kids someday.

09:04.837 --> 09:07.965
Oh, you want kids?
Uuuah, yikes.

09:08.090 --> 09:12.135
Uhhh... I wish you'd told me
that before I got you this.

09:12.302 --> 09:14.304
Oh, did I hear
my big boy say

09:14.388 --> 09:16.557
he's got a crush
on some lucky girl?

09:16.682 --> 09:18.559
Oh, you know, Chris,
I knew this day would come.

09:18.684 --> 09:20.060
So, I brought you
a condom.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.521
Use it wisely, though.
It wasn't easy to obtain.

09:22.604 --> 09:25.941
(couple moaning)

09:26.024 --> 09:27.568
MAN: Ah! Hey,
what the hell are you doing?

09:27.693 --> 09:29.027
WOMAN: Hey,
give that back!

09:29.111 --> 09:30.404
MAN: Aww, man!

09:30.487 --> 09:31.655
WOMAN: Now,
where were we?

09:31.738 --> 09:32.781
(both moaning)

09:32.865 --> 09:33.991
MAN: Oh,
this is much better.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.701
Chris, honey,
the way to win a girl

09:35.784 --> 09:38.161
is to do something
romantic and unexpected.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.873
Hey, hey, remember
the naked spaceman, Lois?

09:40.956 --> 09:44.084
Oh, yeah. You remember
the naked spaceman.

09:44.168 --> 09:45.169
(both laughing)

09:45.294 --> 09:47.421
On my 25th birthday,
your father surprised me

09:47.504 --> 09:50.257
by showin' up in nothin'
but a space helmet and moon boots.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.550
(both laughing)

09:51.633 --> 09:52.759
It just came to me.

09:52.843 --> 09:56.305
You want some Tang,
Mr. Spaceman?

09:56.388 --> 09:57.931
Oh, do I!

09:59.683 --> 10:00.934
Just remember, fat man,

10:01.018 --> 10:03.604
those jugs are mine
until the milk dries up.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.689
Then you can have the remains.

10:08.192 --> 10:10.944
So, basically,
what Orwell was saying

10:11.028 --> 10:13.238
was, "It's not perfect,
but I'll take it."

10:13.405 --> 10:14.573
All right, moving on--

10:14.656 --> 10:16.783
CHRIS: Sorry, I'm late,
Mrs. Lockhart.

10:16.867 --> 10:19.703
Oh, my God, Chris!
What are you doing?

10:19.786 --> 10:22.039
Being romantic
and unexpected.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.208
Chris, you can't
be so impulsive.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.460
People have gotten
into a lot of trouble that way.

10:27.377 --> 10:30.005
Uh, Marie?

10:30.130 --> 10:31.673
Yeah, Donny?

10:31.798 --> 10:33.217
Um...

10:33.425 --> 10:35.135
we cannot tell Mom.

10:38.263 --> 10:41.141
So, Chris, what's the latest
with your little girlfriend?

10:41.225 --> 10:44.728
Oh, I don't think
Mrs. Lockhart likes me at all.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.105
Mrs. Lockhart?
Your teacher?

10:47.189 --> 10:49.816
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

10:49.900 --> 10:53.695
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

10:53.779 --> 10:55.739
Lois, this is not
my Batman glass.

10:55.822 --> 10:56.990
Peter,
are you listening?

10:57.074 --> 10:58.367
Chris has a crush
on his teacher.

10:58.492 --> 10:59.743
Ew, gross!

10:59.868 --> 11:01.328
You know
what else is gross?

11:01.411 --> 11:02.412
(farts)

11:02.496 --> 11:04.581
Aahh!
Broke a damn blood vessel!

11:08.043 --> 11:09.628
How's it coming, dog?

11:09.837 --> 11:12.923
God, Just-- L-- Listen to
this kid's report on Great Expectations.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.759
"Miss Havisham should've
throwed that cake out

11:15.843 --> 11:18.887
so it don't like
mess all up da bitch's house."

11:18.971 --> 11:20.848
I-- I-- I don't know
what to do.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.724
You know? Society's
given up on these kids,

11:22.808 --> 11:24.852
and I feel like
I may be the only one who can help them.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.437
Well, I think your problem
is you're not communicating in a way

11:27.521 --> 11:28.772
that speaks
to their experience.

11:28.856 --> 11:29.940
You know
what you should do?

11:30.023 --> 11:32.317
Get in there tomorrow
and do the robot.

11:32.401 --> 11:35.904
(music playing)

11:36.572 --> 11:39.783
Wow. You know, you're right. Maybe
I should just try a whole new approach.

11:39.867 --> 11:40.868
Thanks.

11:40.993 --> 11:43.453
(music playing)

11:43.537 --> 11:44.830
Okay,
you can stop that now.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.623
I can't hear you,
I'm a robot.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.876
-Come on, knock it off.
-Does not compute.

11:49.001 --> 11:50.419
Booooo.

11:50.502 --> 11:51.795
I'm going to bed.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.463
I do not require sleep.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.924
Booooo.
(laughs)

11:56.091 --> 11:59.386
Ahh, let's see the kid
with the hearing aid from Barney do this.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.933
A'ight, a'ight,
so's I'm chilling in Verona

12:05.017 --> 12:06.476
when my homie busts out with,

12:06.560 --> 12:07.978
"Yo, Romeo,
check out

12:08.061 --> 12:10.397
that biotch Juliet
in the window."

12:10.522 --> 12:12.983
Problem is, Juliet's peeps
are like, East Coast rappers,

12:13.066 --> 12:16.069
and my posse's
representing west si-yeed.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.696
Just like my boys
Tupac and Biggie.

12:17.779 --> 12:18.947
Know what I'm sayin'?

12:19.615 --> 12:20.824
That's racist, man.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.910
Yeah, that's just
straight ignant, dog.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.496
It's good to meet you,
Mr. And Mrs. Griffin.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.540
Well, we wanted
to talk to you about our son.

12:28.624 --> 12:29.625
You see,
Chris really--

12:29.708 --> 12:30.918
L-- L-- Lois--
Lois, honey,

12:31.001 --> 12:33.128
Let's, uh, make sure
we do this delicately, all right?

12:33.629 --> 12:36.632
Mrs. Lockhart... our son...

12:37.090 --> 12:40.135
would like to plow you.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.805
I had a feeling
that's what was going on.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.016
Sorry, our-- our son
can sometimes be a boob.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.809
I-- I mean a melon.
I-- I mean,

12:47.893 --> 12:49.353
a-- a sopping-wet
pair of breasts

12:49.436 --> 12:51.813
-barely covered
by a racing t-shirt. -Peter...

12:51.897 --> 12:53.857
Mrs. Lockhart,
we just wanted you to know

12:53.941 --> 12:56.610
so you could spare his feelings
and let him down gently.

12:56.693 --> 12:59.613
Don't worry.
I know exactly what to say to Chris.

12:59.696 --> 13:00.864
Thank you so much.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.991
You've been
very understanding.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.203
Gosh. You know,
I-- I don't mean to impose,

13:06.286 --> 13:08.413
but... do you have
a picture of yourself

13:08.497 --> 13:10.541
that I could tape
to the back of Lois's head?

13:10.624 --> 13:13.001
(crickets chirping)

13:14.336 --> 13:15.963
(rapping on window)

13:18.674 --> 13:19.925
Mrs. Lockhart?

13:20.008 --> 13:23.387
Chris, come down here.
I need to talk to you.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.514
-Why are you here?
-'Cause I couldn't stand

13:25.597 --> 13:27.683
to be away from you
for another moment.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.394
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.603
I love you, too!

13:31.687 --> 13:34.064
The only problem
is I'm married.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.775
Therefore,
there's only one thing to do.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.945
Um, make a flip book
of a stick figure

13:40.028 --> 13:41.947
whose head gets
bigger and bigger

13:42.030 --> 13:45.242
and bigger and then pops?
(laughs)

13:45.325 --> 13:46.827
This isn't
a flip book, Chris.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.328
They're instructions.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.122
If we're going
to be together,

13:50.205 --> 13:52.749
I need you
to kill my husband.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.001
(screaming)

13:54.168 --> 13:57.462
Hey! Do you have any idea
what time it is?

13:57.546 --> 13:58.964
Get in the house, fatty!

14:07.723 --> 14:09.016
(doorbell rings)

14:09.099 --> 14:12.436
Oh, Chris,
you big beautiful man,

14:12.519 --> 14:14.104
I'm so glad you came.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.899
Up the stairs,
second door on the left.

14:16.982 --> 14:18.317
He should still be asleep.

14:18.442 --> 14:21.028
Mrs. Lockhart,
I don't think I can do this.

14:21.153 --> 14:23.363
-What?
-M-- Maybe you could just get a divorce,

14:23.488 --> 14:26.116
and we could live together
in the fort under my bed.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.244
Fine. I'll do it myself.
But we're through.

14:29.328 --> 14:31.205
Okay. But I gotta
give you the password,

14:31.330 --> 14:33.248
or you can't
get into the fort.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.374
(door slams)

14:34.458 --> 14:36.043
It's taco. Taco!

14:39.129 --> 14:40.255
Oh, good God!

14:40.339 --> 14:41.632
Look at the fat man's underwear.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.050
Looks like
a Jackson Pollock painting.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.593
Don't put that in
with my things!

14:44.676 --> 14:46.094
Huh, what's this?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.555
You know, Stewie,
Mommy doesn't usually read things

14:48.680 --> 14:50.057
outta Chris' pockets.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.725
She's more respectful
than that.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.519
Well, whatever helps you
sleep at night, bitch.

14:53.644 --> 14:56.480
Oh, oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

14:56.563 --> 14:59.525
Chris is gonna murder
Mrs. Lockhart's husband!

14:59.650 --> 15:00.943
W-- We gotta stop him!

15:01.026 --> 15:02.736
Oh, can we stop at
the supermarket?

15:02.861 --> 15:05.864
I want a Granny Smith apple.
Ah!

15:08.825 --> 15:10.619
How's your oatmeal, honey?

15:10.702 --> 15:12.871
You know, it tastes
kinda different than usual.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.414
(growling)

15:14.498 --> 15:16.959
Oh, my God!
There's a bear in my oatmeal!

15:17.042 --> 15:18.460
(roaring)

15:18.544 --> 15:22.714
-(Mr. Lockhart screaming)
-(bear roaring)

15:26.093 --> 15:27.469
(all chattering)

15:27.553 --> 15:29.471
(sighing)
Yeah, I know. I'm late.

15:29.555 --> 15:31.306
Okay, let's just get started.

15:36.562 --> 15:39.565
Hey, yo, man,
what's that thing in the middle?

15:39.857 --> 15:40.983
What, this?

15:41.108 --> 15:43.110
(scoffs)
you gotta be freaking kidding me.

15:43.235 --> 15:44.403
That's an ampersand.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.238
It's a symbol
for the word "and."

15:46.363 --> 15:48.657
My God,
nobody can be this stupid.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.701
N-- N-- Not even Peter
when he took that blow to the head

15:50.784 --> 15:52.327
and thought he was Larry
from Three's Company.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.622
Jack, there's a hot tub party
across the street and we're invited.

15:55.706 --> 15:57.624
Oh, and don't worry,
if, uh, Mr. Furley comes by,

15:57.708 --> 15:58.834
I'll make sure
he thinks you're...

15:58.917 --> 16:00.210
Yeeee

16:00.335 --> 16:03.881
Yo, Mr. Griffin, chillax.
We're doin' the best we can.

16:03.964 --> 16:06.925
There is nothing I would like
to do more than chillax, Amanda,

16:07.009 --> 16:08.802
but w-- without
a decent education,

16:08.927 --> 16:10.012
you could spend
the rest of your life

16:10.095 --> 16:12.639
as a ditch digger
or a motel maid or a hooker.

16:12.723 --> 16:14.099
I could be a ditch digger?

16:14.183 --> 16:15.184
A motel maid?

16:15.267 --> 16:17.519
-I could be a hooker?
-W-- W-- Well, no.

16:17.603 --> 16:18.687
Y-- You don't want
to be a hooker.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.814
Wow, Mr. Griffin!
You're the first teacher

16:20.898 --> 16:22.274
that ever told us
we could do anything.

16:22.357 --> 16:25.068
Well, I-- I-- I didn't mean
sell your body for money.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.029
"O, captain! My captain!"

16:27.112 --> 16:28.280
No, you're
actually misunderstanding.

16:28.363 --> 16:29.531
"O, captain! My captain!"

16:29.615 --> 16:31.116
Well, if it works for you,
I guess...

16:31.200 --> 16:32.576
"O, captain! My captain!"

16:32.659 --> 16:34.745
Yeah, what the hell.
Be the best damn hooker you can be.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.330
"O, captain! My captain!"

16:36.413 --> 16:38.248
In your case,
I'd get the money up front.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.252
(mumbling)

16:43.879 --> 16:47.382
Jack, twins!
Swedish. My place. Now.

16:50.219 --> 16:51.470
(screaming)

16:51.553 --> 16:52.763
Oh, we're too late!

16:52.888 --> 16:56.350
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Okay, I gotta call the police.

16:56.433 --> 16:59.061
Oh! (sniffing) Ugh, what's that smell?

16:59.144 --> 17:00.771
Oh, dead body, right.
That's what that is.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.065
Mmm. I just had a dream
I was an egg,

17:03.148 --> 17:05.692
and I was being hatched
by Elisabeth Hasselbeck.

17:06.068 --> 17:09.488
Ah! No, wait a minute.
I can't call the police.

17:09.613 --> 17:12.282
I have to get rid
of this body, or Chris'll go to prison!

17:12.366 --> 17:14.910
And we all know what happens
in those prison showers.

17:14.993 --> 17:16.078
I've seen Oz.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.247
Scrub scrub here,
scrub scrub there

17:18.330 --> 17:19.831
Whether you're white
or bronze

17:19.915 --> 17:24.211
A man can wash another man
in the merry old land of Oz

17:28.173 --> 17:29.341
(car door shuts)

17:29.424 --> 17:31.009
All right,
wait here, Stewie,

17:31.093 --> 17:33.095
while Mommy
gets the cement blocks.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.138
(gasps)

17:37.641 --> 17:38.767
Everything all right here?

17:38.851 --> 17:41.478
Oh, fine, officer,
just, uh, enjoying the sunset.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.188
No law against that,
is there?

17:43.689 --> 17:44.940
What happened to your shirt?

17:45.023 --> 17:46.191
(laughing)
Oh, you know,

17:46.358 --> 17:47.734
just... a pizza party
at the office.

17:47.818 --> 17:49.152
Oh, yeah? Where do you work?

17:49.236 --> 17:51.697
First Fidelity Insurance
over on Weybosset Street.

17:51.822 --> 17:53.490
Oh, my cousin Arnie
works over there.

17:53.574 --> 17:55.075
Oh, Arnie's
your cousin, is he?

17:55.158 --> 17:56.493
-You know him?
-Oh, somewhat.

17:56.618 --> 17:59.329
Good middle-management type. Just sort of
blends in with the furniture, though.

17:59.413 --> 18:01.290
Never really wowed
anyone at the office.

18:01.373 --> 18:03.542
Yeah. That's always
been Arnie's problem.

18:03.625 --> 18:04.626
Well, take it easy.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.003
Yes, yes,
you too, you too.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.838
Oh, and, uh,
if you see Arnie tell him,

18:07.921 --> 18:09.006
"Oogidy boogidy boo!"

18:09.089 --> 18:10.382
He'll know what it means.

18:16.972 --> 18:18.015
You know what
I hate?

18:18.098 --> 18:19.516
A guy
in a blue suit.

18:19.600 --> 18:20.642
Oogh!

18:20.726 --> 18:21.894
(inhaling)
There's one

18:21.977 --> 18:24.563
right behind me,
isn't there?

18:26.023 --> 18:27.649
You know, Lois,
Chris is cool and everything,

18:27.774 --> 18:29.985
but, uh,
since he killed that guy, uh,

18:30.068 --> 18:32.154
I don't know. Maybe he shouldn't
be livin' with us here now.

18:32.237 --> 18:34.156
-Peter, I'm scared.
-Don't worry, sweetheart,

18:34.239 --> 18:35.324
you'll have
plenty of time to escape

18:35.407 --> 18:36.617
while he's killin' Meg.

18:37.034 --> 18:38.702
He hates her
the most.

18:38.869 --> 18:40.662
Hey, everybody.
What's for dinner?

18:40.746 --> 18:41.955
I'm starving.

18:42.039 --> 18:44.833
My God, his blood lust
is unquenchable!

18:44.958 --> 18:46.126
Hey, Chris, why don't
you take your sister

18:46.210 --> 18:47.669
into the kitchen
for a sandwich?

18:47.753 --> 18:48.754
I don't wanna die!

18:48.837 --> 18:49.880
(crashing)

18:49.963 --> 18:52.049
Why is everybody acting weird?

18:52.132 --> 18:53.759
Chris, honey,
we know what you did.

18:53.884 --> 18:56.470
And I have to say,
honestly, I don't approve.

18:56.553 --> 18:59.348
What I did?
Oh, that I lied about my age

18:59.431 --> 19:01.308
to get into Indian bingo?

19:01.433 --> 19:05.604
-Uh, no...
-That I had hard gas and pooed myself?

19:05.687 --> 19:06.688
Close, but still no.

19:06.772 --> 19:07.814
How is that close?

19:07.898 --> 19:08.941
For God's sake, Chris,

19:09.024 --> 19:10.317
you murdered Mr. Lockhart!

19:10.442 --> 19:11.902
What? No, I didn't!

19:12.027 --> 19:14.613
Oh, come on, Chris. Everybody's done
something they're not proud of.

19:14.780 --> 19:16.240
Like when I used
to be a Wonder Twin.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.326
Peter,
the old schoolhouse is on fire! Let's go!

19:19.409 --> 19:21.119
BOTH: Wonder Twin
powers, activate!

19:21.328 --> 19:23.372
Form of a hawk!

19:24.039 --> 19:25.040
Come on, Peter.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.667
Yeah,
I'll be right behind you.

19:27.793 --> 19:30.546
Shape of...
Jayna's tampon.

19:35.050 --> 19:38.178
PETER: And now
I play the waiting game.

19:38.303 --> 19:39.680
Chris, I saw the body.

19:39.805 --> 19:41.390
Premeditated murder
is one thing,

19:41.473 --> 19:43.392
but I will not
have lying in this house.

19:43.475 --> 19:44.685
Wait, wait, wait
hold it, hold it,

19:44.768 --> 19:46.687
can we finish this
after Joan of Arcadia?

19:46.770 --> 19:48.397
Oh, is Joan of Arcadia on?

19:48.480 --> 19:49.898
All right.

19:49.982 --> 19:51.733
Must be good.
Enjoyable program.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.277
We interrupt this broadcast

19:53.360 --> 19:55.028
to bring you
a breaking news story.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.781
We apologize
to Joan of Arcadia 's sanctimonious,

19:57.865 --> 19:59.992
fear-based
and probably overweight viewers.

20:00.117 --> 20:02.369
That's right, Diane.
It appears Ronald Lockhart

20:02.452 --> 20:04.746
has been brutally murdered
by his wife Lana

20:04.830 --> 20:05.956
and a local bear.

20:06.081 --> 20:07.583
Well, I'll be damned.

20:07.875 --> 20:09.835
Chris, I guess
we owe you an apology.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.044
That's okay.

20:11.128 --> 20:14.339
I just wonder what happened
to Ms. Lockhart and that bear.

20:14.423 --> 20:16.758
The whereabouts
of these suspects are currently unknown.

20:16.842 --> 20:18.177
(crickets chirping)

20:18.510 --> 20:19.678
You ready?

20:19.803 --> 20:21.263
-What's that?
-I thought we'd try that lobster place

20:21.346 --> 20:23.348
we passed in the car.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.392
Yeah, can I just, uh,
finish watching this?

20:25.475 --> 20:27.936
You can watch TV anytime.
I'm starving.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.730
Lana, this is gonna
be a real long trip

20:29.813 --> 20:31.565
if you don't
knock off the crap!

20:34.067 --> 20:35.777
Love you.

20:40.199 --> 20:43.702
(theme music plays)
