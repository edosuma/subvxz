00:14.240 --> 00:15.600
You're not my son.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.360
Why? Because I don't
want to kill innocent people?

00:18.440 --> 00:22.000
Because you're weak,
and you stand for nothing!

00:22.080 --> 00:23.320
Is there a problem, Navi?

00:23.400 --> 00:26.240
Government agents arrested Dina
and surrounded the building.

00:26.320 --> 00:29.280
How much more time
do you need to melt down the plants?

00:29.360 --> 00:30.600
One hour, maybe two.

00:30.680 --> 00:32.479
I don't want to have to kill you, but I will.

00:32.560 --> 00:36.040
I have the suspect in custody.
I need assistance.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.920
I need you to take Dina and her son
back to CTU and head the interrogation.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.600
They'd never let me set foot in CTU,
even if I wanted to.

00:48.040 --> 00:51.640
I can get you reinstated. But I need
to know now, is that what you want?

00:51.720 --> 00:54.760
- I'm sure you're aware of my history here.
- Not an issue.

00:54.840 --> 00:58.000
Jack Bauer and Secretary Heller
both vouch for you. That's enough for me.

00:58.440 --> 01:00.320
Did he work directly for the terrorists?

01:00.400 --> 01:05.080
- I told you, I don't know.
- I need names who can get us to the override.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.120
This place may not be as empty as it seems.

01:07.200 --> 01:10.040
- What? You think this is some kind of trap?
- Yes. I do.

01:10.120 --> 01:13.040
I didn't give them anything. I...

01:13.120 --> 01:16.040
What does CTU know about the override?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Audrey, it's me.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.880
Hey. Did you find anything?

01:24.320 --> 01:28.200
The company that owns the building...
Galaxy Financial. Ever heard of them?

01:28.280 --> 01:31.520
- No. Should I have?
- Your husband's the chief financial officer.

01:31.600 --> 01:34.440
What's really going on?
What? Are you spying on me?

01:34.520 --> 01:38.080
- Are you doing something to spy on?
- What is that supposed to mean?

01:38.160 --> 01:41.280
- Take your hands off of her!
- You set me up!

01:41.360 --> 01:44.800
Put your hands on your head now.

01:44.880 --> 01:48.640
- What do you want?
- I want answers.

02:04.760 --> 02:07.840
You should leave the room
while I question your husband.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.120
Wait outside with the backup team.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.680
- What are you gonna do to him?
- Whatever I have to.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.080
I'm staying.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.960
Fine.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.640
Look at me, Paul.

02:59.080 --> 03:01.880
- Look at me.
- I've got nothing to say to you.

03:01.960 --> 03:03.760
This is what you need to know, Paul.

03:03.840 --> 03:05.840
Five power plants are ready to melt down.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.760
All I care about is making sure
that doesn't happen.

03:08.840 --> 03:13.280
Your name is on a lease on a building in
Chatsworth that was used to plan the attack.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.280
That makes you a prime suspect.
I'm gonna treat you like one. Understand?

03:17.360 --> 03:20.120
My name is on at least 50 different leases.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.920
I own ten corporations. I don't know
about some building in Chatsworth.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.440
I don't believe you.

03:26.520 --> 03:29.560
The lease was notarised.
There's documentation of your ID.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.480
CTU verified your signature.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.320
Paul, you need to start talking to me now.

03:35.400 --> 03:38.440
I've got nothing to say to you.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.720
Jack...

03:52.800 --> 03:54.960
Paul wouldn't betray this country.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.840
Paul is a prime suspect
and he's not cooperating,

03:57.920 --> 04:00.400
and I don't have time
to do this any other way.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.760
I need to know for sure.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.520
Paul...

04:06.600 --> 04:09.960
This is the last chance to talk to me
before I have to hurt you.

04:10.040 --> 04:14.600
Tell me about 24878 Alvert Street in
Chatsworth. Why is your name on the lease?

04:14.680 --> 04:16.760
- Jack...
- Audrey, don't interfere!

04:16.839 --> 04:20.320
If you need to step outside of this room, do it.

04:20.399 --> 04:23.280
Why is your name on the lease?

04:31.200 --> 04:33.920
You're bluffing.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.840
If you've got information, Paul, I need it now.

04:44.760 --> 04:50.720
Come on, Paul, just tell me.
What's your connection with the terrorists?

04:52.600 --> 04:53.960
Jack...

04:54.040 --> 04:56.000
Please don't.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.800
All right, wait, wait.

05:09.880 --> 05:13.720
I don't know the specific building
you're talking about. I can find out.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.400
How?

05:15.480 --> 05:20.880
My corporate records are on my laptop. If that
address is under my name, then it'll come up.

05:20.960 --> 05:24.760
- Maybe there's someone else involved.
- What's your user-ID number?

05:24.840 --> 05:29.000
L-i-it'll be much quicker if I just do it.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.240
Please.

05:44.560 --> 05:50.560
You want me to believe you're not involved
with this? You better show me who is.

06:11.440 --> 06:14.400
Sorry I had to call you here, Marwan,
but I had no choice.

06:14.480 --> 06:18.680
CTU is trying to disable the override
using a Drinfeld module.

06:18.760 --> 06:21.440
They've already shut down over 90 reactors.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.800
We always knew they'd stop some of them.

06:23.880 --> 06:27.000
The important thing
is that one reactor has melted down.

06:27.080 --> 06:31.400
As long as the override has control
of the other five, I can do the rest from here.

06:31.480 --> 06:34.480
Everything is ready for you upstairs.

06:38.120 --> 06:41.880
- Will anyone in the office be suspicious?
- I reported a system failure.

06:41.960 --> 06:45.880
If anyone asks, tell them you're from IT
restoring my hard drive.

06:45.960 --> 06:49.480
My desk is in the last row,
three from the end, C86.

06:49.560 --> 06:53.240
The override is well-disguised
inside the desk. Here is the key.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.160
- Good.
- How long will you need?

06:55.240 --> 06:57.680
45 minutes to melt down the remaining ones.

06:57.760 --> 06:59.960
I am here if you need anything.

07:00.040 --> 07:04.720
- Where's the CTU agent?
- Forbes is questioning him now.

07:56.200 --> 07:59.760
He's out. He's not gonna tell us anything.

07:59.840 --> 08:05.400
- What does Marwan want us to do with him?
- Finish him off, then get rid of the body.

08:05.480 --> 08:08.080
- Take care of it.
- Mm-hm.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.760
He came with a woman and two agents.

08:12.840 --> 08:17.320
- Where are their bodies?
- They're already in the van.

09:13.720 --> 09:19.000
- Here. Here it is. Galaxy Financial Services.
- What kind of a company is it?

09:19.080 --> 09:22.160
It's a failing payroll service
I was about to dissolve,

09:22.240 --> 09:25.280
and someone made an offer
to buy 51 per cent of the shares.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.880
7-800 grand, something like that.

09:27.960 --> 09:33.040
- Here. Harris Barnes, director.
- Who is Harris Barnes?

09:33.120 --> 09:36.880
- I... don't remember.
- What do you mean, you don't remember?

09:36.960 --> 09:40.480
I'm involved with over 30 companies.
I don't deal directly with them.

09:40.560 --> 09:43.240
- How did your name get on the lease?
- I don't know.

09:43.440 --> 09:47.360
You're saying you entered a deal
worth hundreds of thousands of dollars

09:47.440 --> 09:49.040
with someone you'd never met?

09:49.120 --> 09:52.000
- My attorney handles most...
- I don't believe you.

09:52.080 --> 09:58.240
Jack, it's possible. Paul has put together
a lot of deals through his attorneys.

10:08.560 --> 10:09.560
This is Sarah.

10:09.640 --> 10:12.640
- It's me. I need you to run a name for me.
- Go ahead.

10:12.720 --> 10:17.440
Harris Barnes, a director of a California
S corporation, Galaxy Financial Services.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.760
What am I looking for?

10:18.840 --> 10:23.080
Where he lives, businesses,
anything that could connect him to terrorists.

10:23.160 --> 10:27.000
- All right. Give me a minute.
- I'll be here.

10:27.080 --> 10:30.720
She's calling me right back. Excuse me.

10:31.960 --> 10:35.400
Audrey, your boyfriend
is just a thug with a badge.

10:35.480 --> 10:38.280
Why is your name on that lease?

10:39.600 --> 10:41.920
Unbelievable.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.640
An hour ago I was sitting here feeling sorry
for myself that you didn't want me back.

10:46.720 --> 10:50.240
And now you think I'm a terrorist.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.000
You think I was involved
with the kidnapping?

10:55.080 --> 10:57.920
I don't know what to believe any more.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.400
Yeah?

11:04.480 --> 11:08.800
I ran down the name Harris Barnes.
A lot of data came up, but it was inconsistent.

11:08.880 --> 11:13.560
I went into the IRS records and he didn't
appear on their logs until two years ago.

11:13.640 --> 11:14.640
So it's an alias.

11:14.720 --> 11:18.880
It's a washed ID with a valid social
security number and credit card history.

11:18.960 --> 11:22.800
Interpol traced the name and listed
foreign nationals who have used it.

11:22.880 --> 11:26.880
- Who used it most recently?
- A man named Habib Marwan.

11:26.960 --> 11:28.320
We need to find him.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.560
- I think we have.
- What do you mean?

11:30.640 --> 11:33.720
He used the name Harris Barnes
to lease office space in LA.

11:33.800 --> 11:37.840
It turns out the same address was given to us
an hour ago by Marianne Taylor.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.920
- She and Curtis are there now.
- What's the address?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.280
The 29th floor of the Rockland building.

11:43.360 --> 11:46.040
I'm on my way.
When Curtis calls, patch him through.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.000
You got it. You think Marwan's there?

11:49.080 --> 11:53.000
Right now it's our only lead.
If he is, that's where the override is.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.640
I'll get back to you.

12:10.120 --> 12:13.520
I want you to tell me who's still out there.

12:13.600 --> 12:18.480
I want the name of anyone who can help find
that override to stop the plants melting down.

12:18.560 --> 12:21.320
My husband kept all this from me.
I only helped.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.040
Yeah, that's a bunch of crap!

12:24.120 --> 12:28.120
Now, we know you were
just as involved as your husband.

12:28.200 --> 12:32.080
We're aware that the only reason
you're helping us is because of your son,

12:32.160 --> 12:38.160
but believe me, it's not too late for us
to change our minds about how we treat him.

12:41.760 --> 12:46.480
There are a few men
whose names I heard Navi mention.

12:46.560 --> 12:49.360
They might know what you want...

12:50.720 --> 12:54.040
but I don't know how to find them.

12:56.280 --> 12:57.840
All right.

12:59.240 --> 13:03.240
Why don't you start
by writing their names down?

13:07.920 --> 13:12.720
" As far as we can tell, this Habib
Marwan's been controlling the override.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.960
- Jack's on his way there now?
- Yes.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.120
Curtis and his team are already there.

13:17.200 --> 13:22.080
We haven't been able to reach him or his
team members. He's not answering his cell.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.680
- How far is Jack?
- About 15 minutes out.

13:24.760 --> 13:29.040
Keep trying Curtis. Tell him Jack's
on the way. We have to coordinate them.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.920
OK.

13:34.360 --> 13:38.760
Tony, ask her about a man
named Habib Marwan.

13:41.760 --> 13:44.080
Who's Habib Marwan?

13:47.640 --> 13:50.440
I heard Navi speak of him a few times.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.760
He's an engineer.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.440
Beyond that, I don't know.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.720
- " Ms Driscoll?"
- Yes?

14:04.800 --> 14:08.760
This is Nurse Carlson in the clinic.
There's a problem with your daughter.

14:08.840 --> 14:12.920
I think you should get down here
as soon as you can.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.120
- I'll be right there.
- "Thank you."

14:26.840 --> 14:29.480
It's the agent's phone.
What should we do with it?

14:29.560 --> 14:32.200
Nothing. Let them wonder where he is.

14:32.280 --> 14:36.720
By the time they realise what's happened,
it will be too late.

14:36.800 --> 14:40.600
Find out if Adam and Jason have disposed
of the body. They should be back.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.680
All right.

14:43.600 --> 14:47.000
The radiation cloud- tell us more about that.

14:47.080 --> 14:49.560
The government confirmed...

15:04.440 --> 15:06.800
How is the evacuation moving?

15:08.840 --> 15:10.840
It's moving slowly...

15:10.920 --> 15:14.400
- Yeah?
- Ali, Adam and Jason are dead.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.360
- Did the agent escape?
- No. The door is armed.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.440
He's still on this floor.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.480
- Find him.
- "Yeah."

15:28.720 --> 15:31.440
- Yes?
- The CTU agent is loose on this floor.

15:31.520 --> 15:34.080
- How did he escape?
- He killed two of our men.

15:34.160 --> 15:39.160
- Does he know the override is here?
- I don't think so. We have the exits covered.

15:39.240 --> 15:42.360
Disconnect all the hard lines.
He can't contact CTU.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.440
I will.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.880
- " Maya...
- No, no, you can't keep me here!

15:57.960 --> 15:59.040
- Maya...
- No!

15:59.120 --> 16:03.280
- We want to help you feel better.
- I'll feel better when you get out of my face!

16:03.360 --> 16:06.240
- Maya!
- What took you so long?

16:06.320 --> 16:09.120
- I thought she took a sedative.
- She's fighting it.

16:09.200 --> 16:12.840
- Give me a few minutes.
- Sure. Ruth...

16:12.920 --> 16:17.080
Honey, I brought you here so you could
be near me. Isn't that what you wanted?

16:17.160 --> 16:20.160
I want for us to go home.

16:20.240 --> 16:24.760
Maya, we will, honey,
but we can'tjust yet. Honey.

16:24.840 --> 16:27.920
I don't like these people here.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.880
Maya, Maya.
That's not gonna make you feel better.

16:31.960 --> 16:34.360
You're wrong. I do feel better.

16:34.440 --> 16:38.160
- Sweetheart, I need you to...
- Go! Get out!

16:39.520 --> 16:44.480
You're such an important person. Why don't
you take care of your important business?

16:44.560 --> 16:47.880
- Oh, Maya.
- Doctor!

16:47.960 --> 16:49.760
Doctor! Doctor!

16:49.840 --> 16:52.400
Yes, Maya?

16:53.080 --> 16:54.120
I'm sorry.

16:54.200 --> 16:57.080
I'm sorry I was misbehaving,

16:57.160 --> 16:59.800
but I promise to be good

16:59.880 --> 17:04.359
if you'll just get that out of here.

17:08.880 --> 17:11.400
I'm going.

17:15.240 --> 17:16.960
I'm going.

17:17.839 --> 17:20.119
Bye.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.200
- I'll be in my office if you need me.
- All right.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.400
Come on, Maya.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.800
Curtis isn't answering his phone?

17:32.880 --> 17:35.560
Right. It rang before I got his message.

17:35.640 --> 17:38.120
If he had turned it off
it would go to voice mail.

17:38.200 --> 17:42.080
- Where are the field teams?
- Castle's team will be there in two minutes.

17:42.160 --> 17:45.680
I can have them set up a staging area
and stand by for your command.

17:45.760 --> 17:49.080
- What's the probability that Marwan's there?
- We don't know yet.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.920
Where are they staging?

17:51.000 --> 17:54.680
In a parking lot in northwest
Wilshire and Grand, one block away.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.160
OK.

17:56.240 --> 17:59.640
- Have your people found Marwan yet?
- No.

18:01.440 --> 18:06.440
Audrey, I would never be involved in anything
that could bring you harm.

18:06.520 --> 18:11.400
Of all the people he could have approached
he chose you. It's a hell of a coincidence.

18:11.480 --> 18:16.080
It might not be a coincidence. Maybe they
wanted him for more than the corporate shell.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.640
He chose Paul because he was my husband?

18:18.720 --> 18:21.120
That would put them close to your father.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.200
So this Marwan used me
to get to Audrey's father?

18:24.280 --> 18:25.640
It's a possibility.

18:25.720 --> 18:28.680
I had no idea where Audrey
or her father would be today.

18:28.760 --> 18:31.360
The information couldn't have come from me.

18:31.440 --> 18:34.560
They used your relationship
with her father for something.

18:34.640 --> 18:39.920
Maybe to plan something for the future,
a contingency plan.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.320
I've been careless.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.760
I am so sorry.

19:15.320 --> 19:20.960
All right, so far every name Dina has given us
has checked out as a mid-level cell member.

19:21.040 --> 19:26.520
But Marwan, who she claims to have never
met, is connected to everyone on this list.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.440
It looks like all roads lead to him.

19:29.520 --> 19:34.680
This must be his operation, which means she
definitely knows more than she's telling us.

19:34.760 --> 19:40.600
- What do you want to do to make her talk?
- I just need you to give me a little bit of rope.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.680
Do it.

19:54.600 --> 19:57.040
Why don't you tell me about Habib Marwan?

19:57.120 --> 20:00.200
- I already told you.
- No.

20:00.280 --> 20:04.280
- You told me you never met him.
- I haven't.

20:04.360 --> 20:07.240
Danny, could you come in here, please?

20:15.680 --> 20:20.160
I'm gonna need all video and audio
monitoring in this room disconnected.

20:20.240 --> 20:22.240
Thank you.

20:25.200 --> 20:28.640
I'm not a stupid woman.

20:28.720 --> 20:33.440
- What are you trying to prove with this?
- I'm not trying to prove anything.

20:33.520 --> 20:37.440
I just don't want
what I'm about to say to be recorded.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.320
I don't believe you.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.240
Open the door!

21:05.560 --> 21:08.080
Everybody out! Get out now!

21:10.080 --> 21:12.320
Everyone, Erin.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.680
Unless you tell me the whole truth,

21:29.760 --> 21:33.520
that deal you made to save your son is over
and he goes to prison.

21:33.600 --> 21:36.640
You can't do that.
The president signed an agreement.

21:36.720 --> 21:40.840
If that gets in the way of protecting this
country, you think he'll stand behind it?

21:40.920 --> 21:45.840
He's gonna tear it up and your son
goes to prison for the rest of his life.

21:45.920 --> 21:48.440
And I know a little something about prison.

21:48.520 --> 21:50.560
Based on the conditions of his confinement,

21:50.640 --> 21:54.520
I give Behrooz three months
before he commits suicide.

21:54.600 --> 21:58.240
And by the way,
I'm gonna make it my personal mission

21:58.320 --> 22:03.920
to make sure you never hear word one
about what happens to him, ever.

22:16.680 --> 22:18.600
Wait.

22:21.440 --> 22:25.400
Habib Marwan is the man
our cell reported to in the United States.

22:25.480 --> 22:28.800
You said your cell.
How many other cells reported to him?

22:28.880 --> 22:32.000
- I don't know.
- But there are others?

22:32.680 --> 22:34.280
- Yes.
- How many?

22:34.360 --> 22:39.240
I told you, I don't know.
The cells are not in contact with one another.

22:39.320 --> 22:41.680
Marwan thought it was safer that way.

22:41.760 --> 22:45.160
What about the override?
Is it in his possession right now?

22:45.240 --> 22:47.560
- Definitely.
- Why definitely?

22:47.640 --> 22:52.080
Your programmers are trying to interfere
with the meltdown sequence.

22:52.160 --> 22:55.080
Marwan is the only one
capable of stopping them.

22:55.160 --> 22:58.080
- He's controlling it directly?
- Exactly.

22:58.160 --> 23:00.680
Where? Where?

23:00.760 --> 23:03.080
Somewhere in downtown.

23:03.160 --> 23:06.280
The Rockland building?

23:06.360 --> 23:08.640
Yes.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.720
- "Sarah Gavin."
- Get me Jack Bauer on the phone.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.000
You got it.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.960
Place her back in holding.

23:22.040 --> 23:26.400
Dina just confirmed. Marwan's got
the override. He's at the Rockland building.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.280
Everyone, listen up.

23:28.360 --> 23:33.760
The address where Curtis is and where Jack
is heading is the location of the override.

23:33.840 --> 23:37.840
I want every station to focus on this location.
I want field teams ready.

23:37.920 --> 23:43.280
Rework your assault tactics on the building
factoring in this new information.

23:43.600 --> 23:49.160
- " Let me speak to Tony."
- Hold on a second. Tony, I've got Jack.

23:49.240 --> 23:50.560
- Jack.
- Yeah?

23:50.640 --> 23:54.200
Marwan has the override.
He's at the address you're headed to.

23:54.280 --> 23:58.280
- What about Curtis?
- No, we haven't been able to reach him yet.

23:58.360 --> 24:01.160
- Have you changed the assault profiles?
- We're working on it.

24:01.240 --> 24:04.160
Marwan can't know we're coming
or he'll take off.

24:04.240 --> 24:07.400
Also, we have about 20 minutes
before the plants melt down.

24:07.480 --> 24:11.080
Tell Castle to prep for a low-profile assault.
I'm on my way.

24:11.160 --> 24:13.920
Copy that. Get me Castle.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.320
Ali.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.680
Go.

24:21.760 --> 24:25.200
- Have you found him?
- It was not necessary for you to come down.

24:25.280 --> 24:28.080
- Not necessary?
- We will find him.

24:28.160 --> 24:31.000
If I'm captured, it'll end all we've worked for.

24:31.080 --> 24:32.960
He can't get far.

24:33.040 --> 24:35.560
Don't tell me that.
He's killed two of our men.

24:38.640 --> 24:41.000
What is it, Forbes?

24:41.080 --> 24:44.600
- Tell me you've got him.
- "No, I'm sorry. He may have gotten away."

24:44.680 --> 24:47.720
How is that possible?
Ali says the floor is locked off.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.680
I know, we're still searching,

24:49.760 --> 24:53.480
but we've got to deal with ventilation,
air ducts, ceiling space...

24:53.560 --> 24:57.040
I don't care how you get him,
as long as he's contained.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.400
I need 30 minutes.
Can you make that happen?

24:59.480 --> 25:00.800
I can make it happen.

25:01.640 --> 25:03.680
30 minutes.

25:09.640 --> 25:12.120
Who's Marwan?

25:14.800 --> 25:18.720
Who is he? Does he have the override?

25:23.440 --> 25:26.800
Does he have the override?

25:26.880 --> 25:29.200
- Yes.
- Where is he?

25:30.680 --> 25:32.640
Where is he?

25:32.720 --> 25:34.800
One flight up.

25:34.880 --> 25:37.680
I don't have access to the floor.

25:54.680 --> 25:57.800
- "CTU, Sarah Gavin."
- Sarah, it's Curtis. Where's Driscoll?

25:57.880 --> 26:01.520
- Where have you been?
- I'm still in the Rockland building. Listen.

26:01.600 --> 26:04.800
Marianne's dead.
I'm sure our backup teams are dead too.

26:04.880 --> 26:07.760
- The override is here.
- Jack's on his way to you now.

26:23.760 --> 26:26.880
- Jack.
- I need you to put together a security detail.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.800
I'll take care of it.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.920
I want you to stay here until I get back.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.880
- Are you going in?
- Yeah.

26:34.440 --> 26:36.280
Just a second.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.960
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, it's Manning.

26:39.040 --> 26:42.120
- Where are you?
- 29th floor. Where are you?

26:42.200 --> 26:45.880
At the staging area a block away.
Have you secured the override?

26:45.960 --> 26:49.080
No, but it's here.
A man named Marwan is in control.

26:49.160 --> 26:51.920
I know, CTU got a profile.
What's your mobility?

26:52.000 --> 26:55.400
Limited. They're looking for me.
I took an access card off them.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.600
- How do we meet?
- Take the main elevator.

26:57.680 --> 27:01.040
- There's only one guard. I'll take care of him.
- I'm on my way.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.880
They've got Marwan boxed in.
Send your team. Reinforce the perimeter.

27:04.960 --> 27:09.280
I want men on the first floor
in case this thing goes hot.

27:21.120 --> 27:23.480
I'll be right back.

27:24.880 --> 27:27.840
Go! Go!

27:39.880 --> 27:44.080
That was our field agent from the Rockland
building. Your daughter's with him.

27:44.160 --> 27:49.360
- I don't want her anywhere near harm's way.
- She won't be, sir.

28:00.360 --> 28:03.840
- "Are we closing in on the override?"
- " We hope so.

28:03.920 --> 28:06.960
- We believe we've found where it is.
- "Which is where?"

28:07.040 --> 28:08.760
In an office in LA.

28:08.840 --> 28:14.240
We think the terrorists are either associated
with a tenant or they've created a corporation.

28:14.320 --> 28:17.640
- "How is CTU proceeding?"
- We have teams converging.

28:17.720 --> 28:22.160
Once we find the override we have to use it
to reprogram the reactors manually.

28:22.240 --> 28:25.840
- "Will there be enough time?"
- Our people will be ready once we find it.

28:25.920 --> 28:31.680
All right. I don't have to remind
both of you of the consequences if we fail.

28:31.760 --> 28:35.200
Everyone here
understands what's at stake, sir.

28:36.640 --> 28:39.480
Ms Driscoll,
Dr Sanford's on line two.

28:39.560 --> 28:42.160
Excuse me, sir.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.840
I'll meet you on the floor.

28:48.400 --> 28:49.640
Yes, Doctor?

28:49.720 --> 28:53.280
- "Sorry to bother you. Maya's acting out again."
- What is she doing?

28:53.360 --> 28:56.640
She's being abusive to my staff,
she's broken a few things.

28:56.720 --> 29:01.640
If she doesn't settle I'll have to move her
to a private hospital. We can't handle her.

29:01.720 --> 29:06.000
All right, don't do anything.
I'll be right there.

29:13.520 --> 29:15.600
- Sarah.
- Excuse me.

29:15.680 --> 29:18.280
- Is Edgar still on line with NRC?
- Yes.

29:18.360 --> 29:21.880
- Find any other ways to stop the meltdowns?
- Not without the override.

29:21.960 --> 29:26.200
- What's happening at the Rockland building?
- Castle's teams are on the perimeter.

29:26.280 --> 29:29.520
- What about Curtis?
- He's about to meet up with Jack inside.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.280
- Where are you working?
- Station three.

29:31.360 --> 29:35.640
I'll be there in a few minutes.
Call me if Jack or Curtis get the override.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.520
OK.

29:40.880 --> 29:44.120
- You're a cruel person, do you know that?
- Maya, please!

29:44.200 --> 29:46.720
This is a restricted area.
You must stay in bed.

29:46.800 --> 29:49.520
Stay in bed? What am I? A baby?

29:49.600 --> 29:51.000
Maya!

29:51.080 --> 29:53.560
- What do you want, Mother?
- Don't!

29:53.640 --> 29:57.000
Please don't
treat these people disrespectfully.

29:57.080 --> 30:00.560
Please don't tell me what to do!

30:02.320 --> 30:06.080
I'll stop telling you what to do
when you stop behaving like a child.

30:06.160 --> 30:09.000
- What?
- You heard me.

30:09.840 --> 30:14.640
There are other people in this world
besides you and they have problems too.

30:14.720 --> 30:19.880
Now, are you gonna get a grip on yourself,
or do I have to call security to restrain you?

30:19.960 --> 30:24.400
- You're pathetic, you know that?
- I will not allow you to talk to me like this.

30:24.480 --> 30:28.240
- I will not!
- What are you gonna do about it?

30:36.560 --> 30:38.360
I...

30:40.480 --> 30:43.480
I just want to get out of here, Mommy.

30:45.640 --> 30:48.360
And I will take you home.

30:49.560 --> 30:53.160
But I have something I have to finish first.

30:54.240 --> 30:56.040
No.

30:56.120 --> 30:58.480
OK?

30:58.560 --> 31:00.760
Yeah.

31:00.840 --> 31:02.960
Are we clear?

31:04.040 --> 31:05.400
Yeah.

31:05.480 --> 31:07.280
Good.

31:09.800 --> 31:11.880
That's my girl.

31:37.440 --> 31:40.160
We got a man down. Take the wall.

31:47.360 --> 31:49.240
- You OK?
- Yeah.

31:49.320 --> 31:52.880
I overheard a phone conversation.
We have less than 15 minutes.

31:52.960 --> 31:55.560
- How many are still alive?
- At least four.

31:55.640 --> 32:00.080
- Have your men secure the floor. Which way?
- This way.

32:00.160 --> 32:04.160
- What about backup?
- No. We can't let Marwan know we're coming.

32:04.240 --> 32:07.000
- What's upstairs?
- IDS Data Systems.

32:07.080 --> 32:09.840
Marwan's cell must have inserted a sleeper.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.880
And used their servers
to download the virus to the plants.

32:12.960 --> 32:15.480
- By piggybacking on IDS hardware.
- Yeah.

32:15.560 --> 32:18.600
- Take the door.
- All right.

32:20.680 --> 32:21.760
Clear.

32:58.360 --> 33:00.440
Step away from the door, ma'am.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.760
I need you to exit the building.
It's an emergency.

33:03.840 --> 33:05.360
- You ready?
- Yeah.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.440
Let's go.

33:20.800 --> 33:23.440
- Did we get a description on him?
- No.

33:24.080 --> 33:26.240
He could be anyone.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.080
What's up? What's going on?

35:19.080 --> 35:21.160
Hold it!

35:28.560 --> 35:31.840
- Yes?
- Marwan, it's Ali. We've been discovered!

35:34.160 --> 35:35.680
Ali?

35:39.200 --> 35:42.720
- Make sure all the exits are covered.
- Roger that.

35:43.360 --> 35:44.640
Last man down.

36:20.920 --> 36:22.520
Curtis!

36:30.960 --> 36:31.960
Stay down!

36:32.040 --> 36:34.760
Stay down! Get down! Get out of the way!

36:34.840 --> 36:37.560
Stay where you are! Stay down!

36:37.640 --> 36:39.840
- I got this exit!
- You got him?

36:39.920 --> 36:41.840
No!

36:43.960 --> 36:46.960
- Jack, I have the override!
- Secure it!

36:47.600 --> 36:50.600
Call CTU now! Now!

36:51.680 --> 36:54.320
I got him!

36:58.040 --> 37:00.960
- Driscoll.
- "Erin, I have the override. Put Edgar on."

37:01.040 --> 37:03.520
Edgar! Line one. Curtis has the override.

37:03.600 --> 37:06.280
- Edgar Stiles. Is the override logged in?
- Yes.

37:06.360 --> 37:08.760
Send it to channel 11.

37:09.240 --> 37:11.000
- I can't.
- What do you mean?

37:11.080 --> 37:13.680
- The fields are write protected.
- That can't be.

37:13.760 --> 37:16.680
If you're plugged in
you should be able to do what you want.

37:16.760 --> 37:18.680
It's locked. What do you want me to do?

37:18.760 --> 37:21.400
- The clinic called.
- Tell them to wait.

37:21.480 --> 37:24.440
- They said it was...
- Tell them!

37:25.320 --> 37:27.640
If you're gonna do something, do it now.

37:27.720 --> 37:30.760
Marwan must have modified
the override to do this.

37:30.840 --> 37:33.520
The NRC screen shows
the meltdown is beginning.

37:33.600 --> 37:36.280
- Edgar, do something.
- There must be a hot key.

37:36.360 --> 37:39.760
There's a lot of keys.
I can't just try random combinations.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.720
Press the function keys.

37:41.800 --> 37:45.360
The status window will light up
when you get to an active one.

37:45.440 --> 37:48.680
- F5.
- "Good. Hold it down and press escape."

37:49.560 --> 37:52.360
- Nothing.
- Try F5, shift, escape.

37:53.640 --> 37:57.960
- OK, it's responding.
- Good. Send it to channel 11. Hurry up.

37:58.040 --> 38:02.840
Edgar, now they have three plants
in meltdown initiation.

38:13.960 --> 38:16.960
- Did you get it?
- I hope so.

38:26.240 --> 38:29.160
It's starting to respond.

38:37.040 --> 38:39.440
Yes! Yes!

38:39.520 --> 38:43.320
The temperature is dropping
in all remaining power plants.

38:43.400 --> 38:44.760
Good work.

38:47.880 --> 38:52.360
- Congratulations, Edgar.
- " Yeah! Whoo! Congratulations.

38:57.840 --> 39:00.960
- Great work, Erin.
- Thank you, sir.

39:01.040 --> 39:02.800
Excuse me.

39:32.160 --> 39:33.840
Maya?

39:33.920 --> 39:35.720
Where is she?

39:35.800 --> 39:38.080
Maya!

39:39.280 --> 39:41.680
Oh! Oh!

39:43.680 --> 39:45.680
Oh, baby!

39:49.040 --> 39:51.080
Oh!

40:00.240 --> 40:02.200
It's over, sir.

40:02.280 --> 40:05.280
We've stopped the meltdown.

40:05.360 --> 40:07.480
Congratulations, Mr President.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.960
Well done.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.960
This is Bauer. We've got a man down.

40:34.040 --> 40:38.920
Marwan is in the northwest stairwell headed
to ground level. Does anybody read me?

40:39.000 --> 40:42.320
Jack, it's Castle. I'll get a man up there.

40:52.680 --> 40:56.880
Son of a bitch! All CTU agents,
Marwan is impersonating a CTU officer.

40:56.960 --> 41:00.760
I repeat, the suspect
is impersonating a CTU officer.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.040
Solarz, do you read me?

41:07.880 --> 41:10.960
Solarz, do you read me?

41:37.440 --> 41:40.600
