00:10.224 --> 00:11.356
This week on "VICE,"

00:11.392 --> 00:14.926
the battle over what is
and what isn't fake news.

00:14.961 --> 00:16.795
Violence against Trump supporters

00:16.830 --> 00:18.980
isn't being covered. Why is that?

00:19.031 --> 00:21.666
- I am, madam.
- You're like every other goddamn guy

00:21.702 --> 00:23.735
who comes in with a fucking opinion.

00:23.770 --> 00:26.237
"VICE" is fake news? What
are you talking about?

00:26.272 --> 00:28.139
We did allow the enemy into the house.

00:28.175 --> 00:31.242
And then, unlocking the
mysteries of human health

00:31.277 --> 00:32.877
in our microbiome.

00:32.913 --> 00:34.645
This is a medicine for headaches.

00:36.149 --> 00:37.215
Whoa!

00:37.250 --> 00:39.584
We've shifted too far
away from the environments

00:39.619 --> 00:40.618
which supported our health,

00:40.653 --> 00:42.686
and now we need to
move backwards a little.

00:49.528 --> 00:50.828
Go, go, go!

00:53.432 --> 00:55.099
We are not animals!

01:06.578 --> 01:08.712
Since the last presidential election,

01:08.748 --> 01:11.047
America has become increasingly divided.

01:11.082 --> 01:13.816
If you want to discover the source

01:13.852 --> 01:16.453
of the division in our country,

01:16.488 --> 01:18.255
look no further

01:18.290 --> 01:20.657
than the fake news
and the crooked media.

01:20.692 --> 01:23.393
So much so that today's
political opponents

01:23.428 --> 01:25.362
are not only arguing over the issues,

01:25.397 --> 01:28.665
but also over what is
actually considered a fact.

01:28.700 --> 01:31.268
Facts really have no meaning.

01:31.303 --> 01:33.870
Facts are only true to the progressives.

01:33.905 --> 01:35.572
That's not what we do.
We are in the business

01:35.607 --> 01:37.707
of sussing out what is
true and what is false.

01:37.743 --> 01:40.477
The debate over what
is or is not fake news

01:40.512 --> 01:43.012
has become the latest
partisan controversy

01:43.047 --> 01:44.413
in the United States.

01:44.448 --> 01:47.016
So we sent Isobel Yeung
to Washington, D.C.,

01:47.051 --> 01:49.986
the frontlines in this
battle for the truth.

01:57.395 --> 01:58.594
We're here at the White House,

01:58.629 --> 02:00.396
about to head into the press room

02:00.431 --> 02:02.131
for the media's daily briefing.

02:02.167 --> 02:03.632
During the Trump administration,

02:03.668 --> 02:04.801
there's been a lot of
tensions playing out

02:04.836 --> 02:07.970
between the mainstream media
and alternative news sources

02:08.006 --> 02:09.538
that have been spreading fake news,

02:09.573 --> 02:13.276
and often that battle plays
out inside this press room.

02:15.680 --> 02:16.679
So, what's the goal?

02:16.714 --> 02:18.514
You're going to be
Periscoping the whole briefing?

02:18.549 --> 02:20.316
Yeah, I'll see what the vibe is.

02:20.351 --> 02:21.483
You want people to watch

02:21.519 --> 02:23.985
what you do, as your own brand.

02:24.021 --> 02:25.854
That's the key.

02:27.124 --> 02:29.257
Can I ask you to move over
to the left here a little bit?

02:29.293 --> 02:30.326
Sorry.

02:30.361 --> 02:32.194
Mike Cernovich is part of a new class

02:32.229 --> 02:34.129
of conservative media personalities

02:34.164 --> 02:36.765
who garnered huge popularity online

02:36.801 --> 02:38.701
throughout the 2016 election,

02:38.736 --> 02:41.303
and are now gaining access
to the White House press room.

02:42.773 --> 02:44.640
- _
- Hi, guys.

02:45.743 --> 02:47.576
Uh, I hope you guys had a good weekend.

02:47.611 --> 02:50.010
It was definitely a busy one
for the Trump administration.

02:50.046 --> 02:52.513
Over 27,000 people watched

02:52.549 --> 02:55.149
as Mike Cernovich
live-streamed the briefing.

02:55.184 --> 02:57.652
Your questions. Jill.

02:57.687 --> 02:58.649
John.

02:58.655 --> 03:00.421
- Sarah.
- Thanks, Sean.

03:00.457 --> 03:02.056
- Zeke.
- Thanks, Sean.

03:02.091 --> 03:04.291
Margaret. Margaret, Margaret.

03:04.327 --> 03:06.494
What about violence
against Trump supporters?

03:06.529 --> 03:08.128
The media endorses violence.

03:08.164 --> 03:10.365
When you have been asked about, uh,

03:10.400 --> 03:13.100
President Duterte and
his human rights record...

03:13.135 --> 03:15.737
Well, I think there's an
economic piece to this as well.

03:15.772 --> 03:17.805
What about violence
against Trump supporters

03:17.841 --> 03:19.473
that's happened at Berkeley?

03:19.508 --> 03:20.841
And again, I'm just gonna let...

03:20.877 --> 03:22.176
the President will have an opportunity

03:22.211 --> 03:24.945
to speak with him
about those objectives.

03:24.981 --> 03:26.881
So, with that, I'll
see you guys tomorrow.

03:26.916 --> 03:28.148
Have a great day. Thank you.

03:28.184 --> 03:30.317
What about violence against
Trump supporters in Berkeley?

03:30.353 --> 03:31.886
The violence against Trump supporters

03:31.921 --> 03:33.487
isn't being covered. Why is that?

03:33.522 --> 03:35.990
Why will nobody here cover

03:36.025 --> 03:37.657
the violence against Trump supporters,

03:37.693 --> 03:40.694
and why won't you demand
that leaders of the Democrats

03:40.729 --> 03:42.596
disavow the violence from Antifa,

03:42.631 --> 03:44.865
the way you demanded Trump disavow

03:44.901 --> 03:46.633
violence from his supporters?

03:46.668 --> 03:48.802
- You have no answer?
- _

03:48.837 --> 03:49.904
I am, madam.

03:49.939 --> 03:53.006
It is very important that
this get out there. Thank you.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.146
I didn't see actual, you know...

04:00.181 --> 04:01.681
I didn't see any real journalism there.

04:01.717 --> 04:04.250
A lot of high school kids in there.

04:04.286 --> 04:06.286
I got to take you back behind the scenes

04:06.321 --> 04:08.354
and... we'll talk soon.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.651
_

04:13.652 --> 04:14.652
_

04:14.653 --> 04:16.875
_

04:16.882 --> 04:18.331
I do. I want the violence

04:18.366 --> 04:19.933
against Trump supporters to be...

04:19.968 --> 04:21.935
I want to hold the
Democrats to the fire.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.937
And here's what I know...
here's the way I know...

04:23.972 --> 04:26.539
- Time out. It's the White House.
- Yeah. Right.

04:26.574 --> 04:28.040
You wanna hold the
Democrats to the fire,

04:28.075 --> 04:29.408
go to the Democrats.

04:29.444 --> 04:31.610
You have a point of
view, and I understand,

04:31.646 --> 04:33.446
but you don't understand journalism.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.781
You don't understand what
we're really here for,

04:35.817 --> 04:37.316
and that's what pisses me off.

04:37.351 --> 04:38.951
You're like every other goddamn guy

04:38.986 --> 04:40.786
that comes in with a fucking opinion,

04:40.822 --> 04:42.354
and instead of listening,

04:42.389 --> 04:44.323
instead of really
finding out the issues,

04:44.358 --> 04:45.858
you want to grandstand

04:45.893 --> 04:47.493
at the end of a goddamn meeting.

04:47.528 --> 04:49.127
I just want to see the violence

04:49.163 --> 04:51.029
against Trump supporters,
which is rampant...

04:51.065 --> 04:53.165
I want to see some actual
leadership from the media on that.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.834
I wanna see them hold
Democrats accountable.

04:54.869 --> 04:57.202
We're not leaders! We're reporters!

04:57.237 --> 04:58.637
Before Cernovich fancied himself

04:58.673 --> 05:00.072
as a political reporter,

05:00.107 --> 05:01.272
he was a little-known blogger

05:01.307 --> 05:03.140
on the Internet's alt-right fringes.

05:03.176 --> 05:05.009
We might have some breaking news...

05:05.044 --> 05:06.845
During the 2016 election,

05:06.880 --> 05:08.613
he began spreading pro-Trump propaganda

05:08.648 --> 05:11.215
and conspiracy theories
about Hillary Clinton.

05:11.250 --> 05:13.184
A lot of you don't have the trained eye,

05:13.219 --> 05:15.954
so you might not be able
to see this right away,

05:15.989 --> 05:18.222
but she's doing Parkinson's shuffling.

05:18.257 --> 05:20.157
He now has over half a million followers

05:20.193 --> 05:22.927
across multiple platforms.

05:22.963 --> 05:24.696
To get a better sense of his operation,

05:24.731 --> 05:29.000
we went to his house slash
headquarters in Orange County.

05:29.035 --> 05:31.402
Every day I think, "How am I gonna build

05:31.437 --> 05:33.304
a platform and make it bigger?"

05:33.339 --> 05:34.705
The old days of, you know,

05:34.740 --> 05:37.308
"I'm just one guy and I work
for the whatever newspaper,"

05:37.343 --> 05:39.943
that's how you become
irrelevant, that's how you die.

05:39.979 --> 05:41.379
To stay relevant,

05:41.414 --> 05:44.115
Cernovich spends his days
Periscoping to his followers

05:44.150 --> 05:46.217
from a bedroom-cum-studio upstairs.

05:46.252 --> 05:48.819
- So, here it is.
- This is where... this is the office.

05:48.854 --> 05:50.821
This is where the magic happens.

05:55.594 --> 05:57.995
As you see, I just have
things cobbled together here.

05:58.031 --> 05:59.830
So, this computer here

05:59.865 --> 06:02.166
will be my YouTube.

06:02.201 --> 06:04.735
This one will be my Periscope.

06:04.770 --> 06:06.436
These are my burner phones.

06:06.471 --> 06:08.739
And I could do a lot
more if I had more...

06:08.774 --> 06:10.340
- stuff.
- Yeah, you're good at making yourself

06:10.375 --> 06:12.342
- sound bigger than you are.
- Exactly.

06:12.377 --> 06:14.811
Well, it depends on how
you measure impact, right?

06:14.847 --> 06:16.847
How many individual journalists

06:16.882 --> 06:18.949
get more views than I do a month?

06:18.984 --> 06:20.551
You know? Not many.

06:21.486 --> 06:22.786
And... we're back.

06:22.821 --> 06:24.588
Hottest story of the day, of course,

06:24.623 --> 06:28.025
is that CNN staging the
fake news media thing.

06:28.060 --> 06:30.727
There's a camera guy in
the background, by the way.

06:30.763 --> 06:33.030
We did... we did allow
the enemy into the house.

06:33.065 --> 06:35.331
I met this person, Isobel...
do you want to say hi, Isobel?

06:35.367 --> 06:36.966
Hi, guys.

06:37.001 --> 06:38.535
I'm Isobel Yeung, from "VICE."

06:38.570 --> 06:40.537
I met Isabella... how do
you say your last name?

06:40.572 --> 06:41.637
Isobel Yeung.

06:41.673 --> 06:43.473
"'VICE' is fake news."
What are you talking about?

06:43.508 --> 06:45.841
Here, you can sit down. They
can't see you on YouTube.

06:45.877 --> 06:47.377
"Fuck you. Fuck 'VICE."'

06:47.412 --> 06:49.679
Some people are happy,
some people are don't.

06:49.714 --> 06:51.314
"Isobel, are you ISIS?"

06:51.349 --> 06:53.683
Right, that's... that's the new thing.

06:53.718 --> 06:55.751
CNN is ISIS. It's kind
of like a new thing.

06:55.787 --> 06:58.088
So, what are you trying to do here?
What are you trying to achieve?

06:58.123 --> 06:59.889
Just, like, hanging out, really.

06:59.924 --> 07:02.125
So, when I... when I
go live, I can actually

07:02.160 --> 07:04.660
feel parts of my brain activated,

07:04.696 --> 07:07.297
because I'm plugging out of...

07:07.332 --> 07:09.232
this physical world,

07:09.267 --> 07:11.733
and I'm plugging into this
collective consciousness,

07:11.768 --> 07:14.002
this collective matrix.

07:14.037 --> 07:16.205
Anyway, I'll be coming back tonight

07:16.240 --> 07:19.274
to do a live show,
so like and subscribe.

07:21.412 --> 07:23.545
Do you think that it's the failings

07:23.581 --> 07:24.613
of the mainstream media

07:24.648 --> 07:27.249
that has allowed for the
rise of people like you?

07:27.284 --> 07:29.218
Oh, for sure, because
they didn't want to cover

07:29.253 --> 07:30.685
the kind of stories we
thought were important.

07:30.721 --> 07:33.388
If you don't cover stories that a
lot of people want to hear about,

07:33.424 --> 07:35.424
then that's a market
opportunity for other people

07:35.459 --> 07:37.392
and that vacuum is going
to be kind of filled.

07:37.428 --> 07:39.094
I'm going to ask you a
few questions, actually,

07:39.130 --> 07:40.729
which will be "yes" or "no."

07:40.764 --> 07:43.332
Do you believe that
Hillary Clinton was involved

07:43.367 --> 07:45.866
in a child pedophilia ring?

07:45.901 --> 07:48.269
I believe... definitely
that whole story...

07:48.304 --> 07:50.381
Yes or no. Do you believe
that Hillary Clinton

07:50.382 --> 07:51.482
was involved in a child pedophilia ring?

07:51.674 --> 07:53.040
Well, it depends on how you define it,

07:53.075 --> 07:56.010
because there's multiple
definitions of that.

07:56.045 --> 07:58.679
On the 3rd of November... so
five days before the election...

07:58.714 --> 08:00.014
you tweeted...

08:00.015 --> 08:01.528
"The Clintons were
running a pedophile ring.

08:01.529 --> 08:03.046
It's been in the emails all of the time.

08:03.047 --> 08:04.807
We just weren't able to see the code.

08:05.021 --> 08:07.421
- Yeah, I don't agree with that.
- You don't agree with that?

08:07.457 --> 08:09.657
I definitely don't think
the Clintons are personally

08:09.658 --> 08:10.858
running a pedophilia ring.

08:10.893 --> 08:13.294
- So, why did you write it?
- That was worded imprecisely.

08:13.329 --> 08:14.629
- It was more that they...
- Why did you write it then?

08:14.664 --> 08:17.465
Well, Anthony Weiner is a pedophile
and they're connected with him.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.633
Bill Clinton officiated his wedding.

08:18.668 --> 08:21.568
So, why did you say this if
you know that it's not true?

08:21.603 --> 08:22.770
Well, it's not that it's not true,

08:22.805 --> 08:24.171
it's that it's worded improperly.

08:24.206 --> 08:26.674
- So, now you take this back?
- I would reword things

08:26.709 --> 08:28.341
definitely more carefully on Twitter.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.277
You pretty aggressively tweeted this.

08:30.312 --> 08:31.373
You tweeted the idea that they were

08:31.374 --> 08:33.573
very heavily involved
in a pedophilia ring.

08:33.582 --> 08:36.549
You also hash-tagged
"Pizzagate" very aggressively,

08:36.585 --> 08:39.019
which led to the shooting

08:39.054 --> 08:41.922
- _
- in a Comet pizza restaurant in D.C.

08:41.957 --> 08:44.124
Exclusive tonight on
the conspiracy theory

08:44.159 --> 08:46.293
that came to be known as "Pizzagate."

08:46.328 --> 08:48.095
An armed gunman stormed a pizza place

08:48.130 --> 08:50.030
in Washington, D.C.,
known as Comet Ping Pong.

08:50.066 --> 08:51.932
Police say Welch drove six hours

08:51.967 --> 08:53.667
from Salisbury, North Carolina,

08:53.702 --> 08:55.134
to self-investigate a conspiracy

08:55.170 --> 08:57.003
known online as "Pizzagate."

08:57.038 --> 08:59.138
Do you understand,
or if you acknowledge,

08:59.174 --> 09:02.175
the dangers which are
involved in spreading

09:02.176 --> 09:03.176
this sort of false information?

09:03.181 --> 09:05.277
Well, people spun that
whole pizza thing out of...

09:05.313 --> 09:07.346
completely away from
what I was talking about.

09:07.381 --> 09:08.848
But can you understand the
connection between the two?

09:08.883 --> 09:10.680
I definitely believe the Clintons

09:10.681 --> 09:11.784
are connected with
pedophiles and pedophilia,

09:11.820 --> 09:13.421
- the pedophiles in Saudi...
- Can you make the connection?

09:13.422 --> 09:16.055
Do you understand that one
is connected to the other,

09:16.091 --> 09:17.890
and that you tweeting about Pizzagate

09:17.926 --> 09:20.392
and you tweeting about the Clintons
being involved in a pedophilia ring

09:20.428 --> 09:22.661
led to this shooting in broad daylight

09:22.697 --> 09:24.197
in a pizza restaurant in D.C.?

09:24.232 --> 09:25.685
No, because I'm not connected

09:25.686 --> 09:27.443
to what other people are
saying on the Internet.

09:27.468 --> 09:29.701
- On an given day on the Internet...
- So you absolve

09:29.737 --> 09:32.303
all responsibility when it
goes out onto the Internet?

09:32.339 --> 09:34.973
I'm responsible for what I
talk about and what I say.

09:35.008 --> 09:37.542
I'm not responsible for
what other people talk about.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.677
You think you're one of the
best journalists in the country?

09:39.713 --> 09:41.479
In Amer... Oh, for sure. Yeah, for sure,

09:41.514 --> 09:44.449
but the people who are
gonna watch this on "VICE,"

09:44.484 --> 09:47.619
or on HBO, are not my people.

09:47.654 --> 09:50.188
So you guys could create
this, like, caricature

09:50.224 --> 09:51.723
of a madman and a monster,

09:51.759 --> 09:53.355
and maybe two or three people

09:53.356 --> 09:55.026
who follow me on Twitter
will, like, even watch it.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.528
So we live, now, in
like parallel structures.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.965
Right now there's no shared
set of facts in the country.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.134
We wanted to know how polarizing

10:02.169 --> 10:04.435
America's media landscape has become.

10:04.471 --> 10:06.504
So, we visited MIT's Media Lab,

10:06.539 --> 10:08.339
where Eugene Yi and his team

10:08.375 --> 10:10.341
analyzed millions of political tweets

10:10.377 --> 10:12.710
throughout the 2016
presidential campaigns.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.646
So, what are we actually
seeing from this graph?

10:14.681 --> 10:17.282
These are people on Twitter
who are following each other.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.850
The red indicates the Trump supporters,

10:19.886 --> 10:21.786
the blue, the Clinton supporters,

10:21.821 --> 10:24.155
and then the green, Sanders supporters.

10:24.190 --> 10:27.692
Each tiny dot represents a
user tweeting about politics,

10:27.727 --> 10:30.995
with the fine lines showing shared
Twitter connections between them,

10:31.030 --> 10:33.864
clustering them into tribal networks.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.833
There's very few
connections, as you see.

10:35.868 --> 10:37.201
It's very sparse.

10:37.236 --> 10:39.670
Trump supporters are connected

10:39.705 --> 10:41.172
and very tightly clustered

10:41.207 --> 10:43.274
into their own information world.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.876
Secondly, if you look at the pattern

10:45.912 --> 10:48.412
of how these Trump
supporters use Twitter,

10:48.447 --> 10:51.148
they actually tweet four times more

10:51.184 --> 10:53.017
than the average Clinton supporter.

10:53.052 --> 10:57.688
So, did it not come as much of
a surprise to you that Trump won,

10:57.723 --> 10:59.456
with all this passion behind him here?

10:59.491 --> 11:01.725
Well, more than the passion, I think.

11:01.760 --> 11:05.395
Seeing where the journalists
are located in this network

11:05.431 --> 11:10.099
was way more indicative of some
kind of missing feedback loop.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.337
What you see here blinking in blue

11:13.372 --> 11:15.605
are the verified journalists,

11:15.641 --> 11:19.075
and the yellow represent
unverified journalists.

11:19.110 --> 11:21.792
So, both the verified and
the unverified journalists

11:21.793 --> 11:23.723
are all the way over here.
There's no journalists

11:23.724 --> 11:25.349
connecting to the
Trump supporters at all.

11:25.384 --> 11:27.451
Yeah, isn't that... isn't
that very interesting?

11:27.486 --> 11:29.886
So, I mean, Trump has a
real point when he says

11:29.921 --> 11:31.688
we're not listening to the
people who really matter

11:31.724 --> 11:35.392
because these people's views
are not being represented.

11:35.427 --> 11:38.328
At least on Twitter,
we see that there is

11:38.364 --> 11:40.630
a separation of where the journalists,

11:40.666 --> 11:42.431
and who the journalists are following,

11:42.467 --> 11:44.033
and no one is really listening

11:44.069 --> 11:47.237
or plugged into, uh, this
Trump-supporter graph.

11:47.272 --> 11:50.573
This suggests that we are
missing, fundamentally in society,

11:50.608 --> 11:53.776
some of the voices that led to, um,

11:53.811 --> 11:55.444
you know, Trump's success.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.180
These voices included many

11:57.215 --> 11:59.983
formerly fringe bloggers
and alt-right personalities

12:00.018 --> 12:01.751
who saw a golden opportunity

12:01.786 --> 12:03.753
to speak directly to Trump supporters

12:03.788 --> 12:05.721
and create a mass movement online

12:05.757 --> 12:07.623
to elect him as president.

12:07.658 --> 12:09.325
All of these false attacks

12:09.361 --> 12:12.328
are absolutely beneficial.
We're only bigger.

12:12.364 --> 12:14.530
Social media feeds across the country

12:14.565 --> 12:16.831
were flooded with their
pro-Trump messaging,

12:16.867 --> 12:19.034
along with highly-targeted adverts

12:19.069 --> 12:21.270
fueled by mass amounts
of personal information

12:21.305 --> 12:22.905
mined from the Internet.

12:22.940 --> 12:24.439
In the case of the Trump campaign,

12:24.474 --> 12:26.141
the controversial
data-targeting company,

12:26.176 --> 12:27.642
Cambridge Analytica,

12:27.677 --> 12:28.877
claimed to have been integral

12:28.913 --> 12:29.978
to Trump's victory,

12:30.014 --> 12:32.347
reportedly using an analytics technique

12:32.383 --> 12:33.949
called psychometrics.

12:33.984 --> 12:36.651
We were able to use data to identify

12:36.686 --> 12:38.720
that there was very large quantities

12:38.755 --> 12:40.155
of persuadable voters there

12:40.190 --> 12:42.291
that could be influenced

12:42.326 --> 12:44.626
to vote for the Trump campaign.

12:44.661 --> 12:46.194
Psychologist Michal Kosinski

12:46.230 --> 12:48.830
is not affiliated with
Cambridge Analytica,

12:48.865 --> 12:51.833
but he is an expert in
the field of psychometrics.

12:51.868 --> 12:54.669
Psychometrics aims at measuring

12:54.704 --> 12:56.404
psychological traits.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.239
A computer model, just by looking

12:58.274 --> 13:01.075
at the books you're reading,
movies that you're watching,

13:01.110 --> 13:04.145
or websites that you're visiting,

13:04.180 --> 13:06.915
would be able to infer
your political views

13:06.950 --> 13:10.852
with an accuracy that is not
achievable to human judges.

13:10.887 --> 13:12.219
Do you think that people
realized, at the time,

13:12.255 --> 13:15.723
that their own digital footprint,
and that this big data was being used

13:15.759 --> 13:19.327
to actually target them
with personalized adverts?

13:19.362 --> 13:21.796
I think that people do not realize

13:21.832 --> 13:25.833
how much an algorithm
can know about them.

13:25.868 --> 13:28.035
The same algorithm can also be used

13:28.071 --> 13:31.705
to reveal your intimate
traits without your knowledge

13:31.740 --> 13:34.575
and without your consent, which clearly

13:34.610 --> 13:37.078
creates huge risks for the individuals

13:37.113 --> 13:39.447
and for the society as a whole.

13:39.482 --> 13:42.049
While Cambridge Analytica
has denied any wrongdoing,

13:42.085 --> 13:44.518
a UK regulatory authority has named them

13:44.553 --> 13:46.753
as part of a widespread investigation

13:46.789 --> 13:48.422
into the use of data analytics

13:48.458 --> 13:50.591
for political purposes in that country.

13:50.626 --> 13:52.826
Is there any proof at
all of the effectiveness

13:52.862 --> 13:55.029
of psychometrics in the
most recent election?

13:55.064 --> 13:56.763
One of the pieces of evidence

13:56.799 --> 13:59.765
is to look at the amount of
money that has been spent on it.

13:59.801 --> 14:03.603
Politicians, very much like
companies, are rational beings

14:03.638 --> 14:06.572
and they won't throw money at
something that doesn't work.

14:06.608 --> 14:09.209
Cambridge Analytica
has since backtracked,

14:09.244 --> 14:12.445
claiming it never used psychometrics
for the Trump campaign after all.

14:12.481 --> 14:14.914
But political campaigns around the world

14:14.949 --> 14:18.151
are pumping money into the
use of big data for elections.

14:18.186 --> 14:20.220
In fact, one of Trump's top donors,

14:20.255 --> 14:23.023
billionaire computer
scientist Robert Mercer,

14:23.058 --> 14:24.457
invested millions of dollars

14:24.493 --> 14:25.958
into Cambridge Analytica.

14:25.994 --> 14:29.029
Mercer did not respond to
our requests for an interview,

14:29.064 --> 14:30.763
But we spoke with David Magerman.

14:30.798 --> 14:32.664
He was a key architect of Mercer's

14:32.699 --> 14:34.599
billion-dollar hedge fund algorithms

14:34.635 --> 14:35.700
for nearly 20 years.

14:35.736 --> 14:38.603
Cambridge Analytica themselves
have denied that they've

14:38.639 --> 14:41.006
really had much impact
at all on the elections.

14:41.042 --> 14:42.707
Do you think that
that could be the case?

14:42.743 --> 14:44.276
I don't believe that's possible.

14:44.311 --> 14:47.679
Bob Mercer is a lot of things.
One thing he is, is brilliant.

14:47.714 --> 14:49.864
If he invested the kind of money

14:49.865 --> 14:51.350
that he invested in Cambridge Analytica,

14:51.385 --> 14:54.253
and if he asked candidates
that he wanted to win

14:54.288 --> 14:55.854
to use Cambridge Analytica,

14:55.889 --> 14:57.656
he's doing it because he knows it works.

14:57.691 --> 15:00.725
Magerman is suing Mercer
for wrongful termination,

15:00.761 --> 15:02.961
claiming he was fired
for speaking to the press

15:02.996 --> 15:05.364
about Mercer's involvement
with the Trump campaign.

15:05.399 --> 15:07.098
Mercer's attorney has described

15:07.133 --> 15:09.601
Magerman's allegations as meritless.

15:09.636 --> 15:12.003
Wealthy people and
businessmen have always given

15:12.039 --> 15:15.106
sizable donations to politicians
and to political campaigns.

15:15.141 --> 15:18.109
What's so different about
what Robert Mercer's done?

15:18.144 --> 15:20.211
I think that there's a new wave

15:20.246 --> 15:22.547
of political donors

15:22.583 --> 15:25.349
that are buying overwhelming influence

15:25.385 --> 15:30.088
over the views of the people
who they're supporting.

15:30.123 --> 15:31.823
One of Mercer's key collaborators

15:31.858 --> 15:32.857
in obtaining that influence

15:32.893 --> 15:35.060
has been Trump's
former chief strategist,

15:35.095 --> 15:37.462
and executive chairman
of Breitbart News,

15:37.497 --> 15:39.230
Steve Bannon.

15:39.265 --> 15:40.294
Bannon also formerly served

15:40.295 --> 15:42.495
as the vice president
of Cambridge Analytica.

15:42.802 --> 15:45.303
And Mercer pumped millions
into Breitbart News,

15:45.338 --> 15:46.870
which was used as a strategic

15:46.906 --> 15:48.872
pro-Trump tool during the election.

15:48.908 --> 15:51.875
Bob Mercer saw, before most people,

15:51.911 --> 15:55.179
the impact that
non-mainstream media could have

15:55.215 --> 15:56.647
on manipulating voters

15:56.682 --> 15:59.450
and on getting people to believe
what he wanted them to believe.

15:59.486 --> 16:01.051
And when the mainstream media

16:01.087 --> 16:02.987
began reporting on false information

16:03.022 --> 16:05.723
spread by these new alternative outlets,

16:05.758 --> 16:08.392
a war over facts arose
between the two sides.

16:08.428 --> 16:10.094
Look, alternative facts are not facts.

16:10.130 --> 16:11.562
They're falsehoods.

16:11.598 --> 16:14.798
This has been fueled by the
president's personal crusade

16:14.834 --> 16:16.766
against the traditional press.

16:16.801 --> 16:18.668
Media outlets

16:18.703 --> 16:21.338
like CNN and MSNBC

16:21.373 --> 16:23.140
are fake news.

16:23.175 --> 16:25.008
We now live in a world where any facts

16:25.043 --> 16:27.244
you disagree with can be labeled "fake,"

16:27.279 --> 16:30.780
leading to a record low of
only 32% of the population

16:30.815 --> 16:32.915
now actually trusting the press.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.651
No, not you. Not you.

16:34.686 --> 16:37.154
- Your organization is terrible.
- You are attacking our news organization.

16:37.189 --> 16:39.489
Your organization is terrible. Let's go.

16:39.525 --> 16:40.890
One of Trump's favorite targets

16:40.925 --> 16:43.460
in his war on mainstream media is CNN

16:43.495 --> 16:46.328
and their senior White House
correspondent, Jim Acosta.

16:46.364 --> 16:48.364
Aren't you concerned, sir,
that you are undermining

16:48.399 --> 16:52.000
the people's faith in the First
Amendment, Freedom of the Press,

16:52.036 --> 16:54.670
when you call stories you
don't like "fake news"?

16:54.705 --> 16:57.906
The public doesn't
believe you people anymore.

16:57.941 --> 17:00.142
Now, maybe I had something
to do with that. I don't know.

17:00.178 --> 17:03.345
We spoke to Acosta about
reporting on the White House

17:03.381 --> 17:05.047
in the fake news era.

17:05.082 --> 17:06.982
Do you feel like this
term, "fake news," has been

17:07.017 --> 17:09.084
hijacked by the administration?
Has been jumped on?

17:09.118 --> 17:11.554
It's being exploited,
no question about it.

17:11.589 --> 17:14.156
They want to damage the credibility

17:14.192 --> 17:16.592
of news organizations that are reporting

17:16.627 --> 17:18.160
factual information

17:18.195 --> 17:21.061
about things that are going
on here at this White House.

17:21.097 --> 17:22.829
And when he calls us fake news,

17:22.865 --> 17:24.464
okay, let's... let's examine that.

17:24.501 --> 17:25.792
I'm not the one who said

17:25.794 --> 17:28.368
that Barack Obama wasn't
born in the United States.

17:29.372 --> 17:30.672
That was fake news.

17:30.707 --> 17:32.840
The President of the United
States did not have a larger

17:32.875 --> 17:36.110
inauguration crowd
size than Barack Obama.

17:36.145 --> 17:37.978
President Trump said that Barack Obama

17:38.014 --> 17:39.880
was wiretapping him at Trump Tower.

17:39.916 --> 17:41.382
That's fake news.

17:41.418 --> 17:45.152
We're reporting on a president who...

17:45.188 --> 17:46.588
has engaged, time and again,

17:46.623 --> 17:48.690
in his own version of fake news.

17:48.725 --> 17:49.869
Why is it, do you think,

17:49.870 --> 17:51.192
that the American public
is so divided right now

17:51.228 --> 17:53.761
and that there is so much trust
in what the president says?

17:53.796 --> 17:56.530
You know, I think that
bitter partisanship

17:56.565 --> 17:59.633
is always going to exist
in the United States.

17:59.668 --> 18:01.836
The extreme left and right

18:01.871 --> 18:04.004
squaring off in bloody demonstrations

18:04.040 --> 18:06.406
in recent weeks.

18:06.442 --> 18:09.176
These people, Antifa, are Neo-communists

18:09.212 --> 18:11.311
and they need to be rejected
by the Democratic party,

18:11.347 --> 18:13.714
just like Republicans have
rejected the Neo-Nazis.

18:16.285 --> 18:18.352
The idea that a president
of the United States

18:18.387 --> 18:19.620
cannot unambiguously

18:19.655 --> 18:22.723
denounce Nazism... is extraordinary.

18:22.759 --> 18:24.391
It's time to expose

18:24.426 --> 18:26.426
the crooked media deceptions,

18:26.462 --> 18:29.162
and to challenge the media

18:29.197 --> 18:32.499
for their role in fomenting divisions.

18:32.534 --> 18:34.901
The danger becomes

18:34.936 --> 18:37.537
when you have somebody

18:37.573 --> 18:38.972
in the Oval Office

18:39.007 --> 18:42.309
who is fomenting an
atmosphere of division.

18:42.344 --> 18:44.911
What's at stake is...

18:44.946 --> 18:47.847
we get to a point in
this country where...

18:47.883 --> 18:51.685
half of the country only believes
something because the president says

18:51.720 --> 18:52.986
that's what the truth is.

18:53.021 --> 18:56.256
Um, the president doesn't get
to decide what the truth is.

18:58.694 --> 19:01.661
In season three, we covered
the search for new drugs

19:01.696 --> 19:03.862
to combat powerful
and sometimes incurable

19:03.898 --> 19:06.999
bacterial infections known as superbugs.

19:07.034 --> 19:09.268
We then followed up that
story with our report

19:09.304 --> 19:11.036
on the use of fecal transplants,

19:11.071 --> 19:13.172
or injecting beneficial bacteria

19:13.207 --> 19:15.675
from one person's gastric
system into another's,

19:15.710 --> 19:17.576
to actually treat these superbugs.

19:17.612 --> 19:19.978
Who would have ever thought
this was, like, the cure?

19:20.014 --> 19:23.215
You just put other people's
poop in you, and it works.

19:23.250 --> 19:24.417
Right.

19:24.452 --> 19:26.452
As this previously-untapped
scientific field

19:26.487 --> 19:27.720
continues to evolve,

19:27.755 --> 19:29.822
the possibilities for human health

19:29.857 --> 19:31.524
could be limitless.

19:31.559 --> 19:34.659
So we sent Thomas Morton to
investigate the next steps

19:34.695 --> 19:36.828
in this emerging field of medicine.

19:51.077 --> 19:52.544
The lady I'm very carefully

19:52.579 --> 19:54.212
trying not to infect with anything

19:54.247 --> 19:56.648
has an aggressive form
of bone marrow cancer.

19:56.683 --> 19:58.483
Her doctors have put
her in sterile isolation

19:58.518 --> 19:59.818
following a massive dose of chemo

19:59.853 --> 20:03.154
which has left her immune
system practically nonexistent.

20:03.189 --> 20:05.022
That chart up there,
they'll start writing down

20:05.058 --> 20:07.124
my red and white blood
cells, my platelets,

20:07.160 --> 20:08.759
and they'll keep track of it every day.

20:08.794 --> 20:11.662
Today is zero, and then tomorrow
will be, you know, plus one.

20:11.697 --> 20:13.030
Okay.

20:13.066 --> 20:14.531
To replenish her white blood cell count,

20:14.567 --> 20:17.501
Anne's about to receive a
routine stem cell transplant,

20:17.536 --> 20:18.870
but to get her gut
back in working order,

20:18.905 --> 20:21.772
she'll have to undergo a
slightly less routine procedure.

20:21.807 --> 20:23.941
The chemotherapy, like,
wipes out everything,

20:23.977 --> 20:26.043
and not only does it
wipe out your blood cells,

20:26.079 --> 20:27.411
but everything in your GI tract.

20:27.446 --> 20:30.781
All this natural flora that's
growing there that protects you

20:30.816 --> 20:32.583
and has things moving along,

20:32.618 --> 20:34.919
is all wiped out as well.

20:34.954 --> 20:38.222
- When did you submit your stool sample?
- A couple of weeks ago.

20:38.258 --> 20:40.557
- It's not fun, right?
- No.

20:40.593 --> 20:43.094
Especially, you know, 'cause I
took the train in from Long Island,

20:43.129 --> 20:44.528
so, I have my bag of poop

20:44.563 --> 20:46.101
and there's just enough room for me

20:46.102 --> 20:47.230
to squeeze in and get my bag of poop,

20:47.266 --> 20:50.000
like, right up in everybody's faces.

20:50.035 --> 20:52.202
So, you're banking your own bacteria?

20:52.237 --> 20:54.070
And then once I have the red blood cells

20:54.106 --> 20:55.972
and white blood cells
building back up again,

20:56.008 --> 20:58.709
then they would, like,
re-inject them into me

20:58.744 --> 21:00.911
- with, like, an enema.
- Okay, yeah.

21:04.249 --> 21:05.869
Dr. Ying Taur and his team

21:05.870 --> 21:07.050
have found that a fecal transplant

21:07.085 --> 21:09.653
can increase the odds of survival
by restoring the diversity

21:09.688 --> 21:12.055
of gut bacteria lost during chemo.

21:12.090 --> 21:14.458
Is there a direct relationship
between the diversity

21:14.493 --> 21:17.127
of flora in the gut and immune health?

21:17.162 --> 21:18.694
In terms of the microbiome,

21:18.730 --> 21:20.363
if you look at a transplant patient's

21:20.399 --> 21:22.865
diversity during their treatment,

21:22.901 --> 21:25.135
if you had a low diversity,

21:25.170 --> 21:28.038
then you were over
five times more likely

21:28.073 --> 21:30.673
to die of transplant-related causes,

21:30.708 --> 21:33.609
compared to if you had a nice diversity

21:33.645 --> 21:36.379
of healthy, health-promoting bacteria

21:36.415 --> 21:37.247
in your gut.

21:37.282 --> 21:40.050
There's this amazing set of creatures

21:40.085 --> 21:43.186
living in all of us, working 24/7,

21:43.221 --> 21:44.587
for mutual benefit.

21:44.622 --> 21:47.557
And we're seeing links everywhere.

21:47.592 --> 21:50.226
We're seeing links to
prevention of infection,

21:50.262 --> 21:51.928
to allergies,

21:51.963 --> 21:53.463
autoimmune disorders,

21:53.498 --> 21:56.332
mood, autism, depression.

21:56.367 --> 21:58.601
All these creatures working inside us

21:58.636 --> 22:01.604
are what scientists refer
to as the human microbiome.

22:01.639 --> 22:02.972
Now, this has opened

22:03.007 --> 22:04.841
a whole new dimension in medicine.

22:04.876 --> 22:07.242
You know, it's not science
fiction anymore, as you can see,

22:07.278 --> 22:08.410
it's out on the frontlines.

22:08.446 --> 22:10.680
I don't... I don't recall
any fecal transplants

22:10.715 --> 22:14.750
in the science fiction I read or saw.

22:14.786 --> 22:16.953
Since the 19th century,
germ theory has been

22:16.988 --> 22:18.888
the dominant model of medical thinking.

22:18.923 --> 22:21.290
It holds that microorganisms
like bacteria and viruses

22:21.325 --> 22:24.559
are responsible for infecting
our bodies and causing disease.

22:24.595 --> 22:26.462
Therefore, the best way to avoid disease

22:26.497 --> 22:29.098
is to cleanse our body and
its surroundings of germs.

22:29.133 --> 22:31.666
Unfortunately, this
antibacterial dragnet

22:31.702 --> 22:35.004
has not only helped eliminate dangerous
pathogens from our environment,

22:35.039 --> 22:37.706
it's also knocked out the good
microorganisms that live in us

22:37.741 --> 22:39.774
and are responsible
for healthy digestion,

22:39.810 --> 22:42.077
immune reaction, and, as
researchers are learning,

22:42.113 --> 22:44.646
an ever-widening number of vital roles.

22:46.583 --> 22:48.350
We've done an awful lot of work

22:48.386 --> 22:50.119
looking at how the built environment

22:50.154 --> 22:51.487
that we've constructed around ourselves

22:51.522 --> 22:54.923
affects how our microbes
develop in our microbiome.

22:54.958 --> 22:57.626
Dr. Jack Gilbert is the
head of microbiome research

22:57.661 --> 22:58.860
at Argonne National Labs.

22:58.896 --> 23:01.929
He has found that living in areas
with high microbial diversity

23:01.964 --> 23:05.233
significantly reduces the occurrence
of asthma and other diseases.

23:05.268 --> 23:08.669
We've got places like Amish
communities here in America,

23:08.704 --> 23:10.938
whereby the children
are exposed to animals

23:10.973 --> 23:13.274
and dust and dirt environments

23:13.309 --> 23:15.910
that their ancestors were
exposed to on a regular basis.

23:15.945 --> 23:18.579
And those children have
very low levels of asthma,

23:18.614 --> 23:20.781
very low levels of atopy,

23:20.816 --> 23:22.517
so, you know, allergic disease,

23:22.552 --> 23:24.252
and even lower levels of autism.

23:24.287 --> 23:25.853
If we go into the developing world,

23:25.888 --> 23:29.057
those children have
many, many, many more

23:29.092 --> 23:30.724
microbial exposures.

23:30.760 --> 23:33.527
But there's a cost-benefit
analysis there,

23:33.562 --> 23:35.762
that they also have much higher levels

23:35.797 --> 23:36.896
of infant mortality.

23:36.932 --> 23:39.866
Because their access
to medical prevention

23:39.901 --> 23:42.035
for diseases and other complications

23:42.071 --> 23:43.303
is much more limited.

23:43.338 --> 23:45.372
Would the best of both
worlds be to, you know,

23:45.407 --> 23:47.874
grow up somewhere with the
medicine available to you,

23:47.909 --> 23:50.009
to you know, not die when
you're sick, obviously,

23:50.045 --> 23:53.980
but, um, nevertheless be exposed
to much more bacteria than we are,

23:54.015 --> 23:56.249
or much more microorganisms?

23:56.285 --> 23:58.651
Absolutely, I mean,
we've shifted too far away

23:58.687 --> 24:00.954
from the environments
which supported our health,

24:00.989 --> 24:02.689
and now we need to move
backwards a little bit.

24:02.724 --> 24:04.691
This is why it's so
important to go to Africa,

24:04.726 --> 24:06.326
and study populations of people

24:06.361 --> 24:08.995
which we wouldn't normally have
access to in this community.

24:14.335 --> 24:16.002
So, we did. We came to Africa.

24:16.037 --> 24:19.072
We're in the Central
African Republic right now

24:19.107 --> 24:20.807
in a town called Bayanga,

24:20.842 --> 24:22.475
smack in the heart of Africa.

24:22.510 --> 24:24.877
We're following Dr. Andres Gomez,

24:24.913 --> 24:28.180
who is a microbiome researcher.

24:28.216 --> 24:29.983
When we talk about Westerners,

24:30.018 --> 24:32.485
with our industrialized microbiomes,

24:32.520 --> 24:34.320
we lack diversity.

24:34.355 --> 24:37.256
To learn what's missing from
the industrialized microbiome,

24:37.291 --> 24:39.492
researchers like Dr. Gomez
have turned to the planet's

24:39.527 --> 24:41.527
few remaining pre-industrial societies,

24:41.562 --> 24:44.229
to see what their guts
have that our guts don't.

24:44.264 --> 24:46.364
Dr. Gomez hit fecal pay
dirt while looking at

24:46.399 --> 24:48.934
the microbiome's Mountain
Gorillas in Central Africa.

24:48.969 --> 24:51.103
He realized that the stool
samples he was taking from them

24:51.138 --> 24:52.871
bore an uncanny
resemblance to samples taken

24:52.906 --> 24:55.273
from the people living
in the surrounding forest,

24:55.308 --> 24:56.842
called the BaAka.

24:56.877 --> 24:58.644
I collected the samples,

24:58.679 --> 25:00.646
sequenced their microbiomes,
and that's where I discovered

25:00.681 --> 25:03.281
this was something... this
was something important here.

25:03.316 --> 25:05.583
The BaAka are traditional
hunter-gatherers

25:05.619 --> 25:08.286
who live in the
Dzanga-Sangha forest preserve.

25:08.321 --> 25:10.255
Their lifestyle is not
only pre-industrial,

25:10.290 --> 25:12.057
but pre-agricultural.

25:12.092 --> 25:13.892
The fact that the BaAka's
microbial diversity

25:13.927 --> 25:16.360
is closer to gorillas
than industrialized people,

25:16.395 --> 25:18.228
suggests that their
environment and lifestyle

25:18.264 --> 25:20.330
have an enormous effect
on their microbiomes.

25:20.366 --> 25:22.366
So, we hiked for two
hours into the jungle

25:22.401 --> 25:24.802
to see what both these things look like.

25:27.206 --> 25:30.141
This is it. So, these
are all their huts.

25:31.978 --> 25:33.832
_

25:33.913 --> 25:36.681
Everybody is now
mobilizing to go hunting.

25:36.682 --> 25:39.970
_

25:42.171 --> 25:45.801
_

25:45.825 --> 25:47.825
He's telling the animals
to come into his net.

25:49.127 --> 25:51.795
The BaAka hunt by stringing
up nets in a large circle...

25:53.365 --> 25:56.032
then flushing out animals from the
encircled forest into said nets.

25:57.803 --> 26:00.103
Which isn't always as
cut and dry as it sounds.

26:02.675 --> 26:05.609
That's, I guess, the fourth
animal that's gotten through a net.

26:07.112 --> 26:09.779
Yeah, today's really
a gather day, for sure.

26:13.686 --> 26:16.453
Part of what Andres is studying,

26:16.488 --> 26:17.654
in terms of the microbiome,

26:17.690 --> 26:19.856
a good deal of that relates
to what we'll be gathering:

26:19.891 --> 26:21.458
the foods that they eat,

26:21.493 --> 26:24.493
and also the bark from trees
and stuff they use as medicines.

26:24.529 --> 26:29.599
But the environment itself has a
major impact on your microbiome.

26:29.634 --> 26:32.568
So, if you can't climb
a tree and collect honey,

26:32.604 --> 26:35.071
you're not man enough to have a wife.

26:35.107 --> 26:36.305
Wow.

26:36.341 --> 26:39.763
_

26:41.947 --> 26:43.113
Ugh.

26:43.148 --> 26:45.381
Oof.

26:45.416 --> 26:48.384
- Is that shrimp?
- Pull it. Keep pulling.

26:50.588 --> 26:52.688
Whoa! I did not expect that to come out.

26:52.724 --> 26:55.258
That's food, right?

26:55.293 --> 26:58.026
The forest not only acts as the
BaAka's live-in grocery store,

26:58.062 --> 26:59.494
but also their pharmacy.

26:59.529 --> 27:01.596
The barks and leaves
the BaAka use as medicine

27:01.632 --> 27:03.899
may seem primitive to
the average CVS shopper,

27:03.934 --> 27:05.134
but unlike modern antibiotics,

27:05.169 --> 27:07.702
which don't always discriminate
between good and bad bacteria,

27:07.738 --> 27:10.272
they're a lot easier on the microbiome.

27:10.307 --> 27:12.975
We're gonna scrape this bark.

27:12.976 --> 27:16.533
_

27:16.543 --> 27:18.013
Oh, you put your breast milk in it

27:18.048 --> 27:21.016
and then you would use
that and put it in your ear.

27:21.051 --> 27:23.051
This is a medicine for headaches.

27:23.087 --> 27:24.853
You rub it up in your hands.

27:26.723 --> 27:27.790
Whoa!

27:28.959 --> 27:30.358
Ah.

27:30.394 --> 27:31.927
It burns a little bit.

27:31.962 --> 27:33.595
Yeah, it does. It burns a lot.

27:33.630 --> 27:35.363
- Well, headache gone.
- Yeah.

27:35.399 --> 27:38.400
Two foods that Dr. Gomez is
particularly interested in,

27:38.435 --> 27:40.968
due to their potential connection
to the BaAka's microbiome,

27:41.004 --> 27:42.870
are cocoa leaves and forest yams,

27:42.906 --> 27:46.207
which have a much higher fiber content
than their Western counterparts.

27:46.242 --> 27:48.677
This is the thing, if we
have the right microbiome,

27:48.678 --> 27:52.980
- Right.
- like these people have been adapted to for millennia,

27:53.016 --> 27:56.451
those things are now gonna
be detrimental for you.

27:56.486 --> 27:58.186
Like how a cow can eat
grass, but we can't.

27:58.221 --> 28:00.455
Like how a cow can eat
grass, but we can't, yeah.

28:00.490 --> 28:02.324
The cocoa leaves the
BaAka eat by the pile

28:02.359 --> 28:05.026
are likewise ill-suited
to our industrialized guts.

28:05.061 --> 28:07.294
What role do these
play in the microbiome?

28:07.330 --> 28:09.563
Fermentation. I wouldn't be surprised

28:09.598 --> 28:11.865
if the bloom of
specific bacterial groups

28:11.900 --> 28:14.635
is a response to this
specific cocoa leaf.

28:14.670 --> 28:15.836
The BaAka's fiber-rich diet

28:15.871 --> 28:18.339
doesn't just make taking
stool samples a lot easier,

28:18.374 --> 28:21.742
the breakdown and fermentation
of complex foods in their colon

28:21.777 --> 28:24.077
helps populate the lower
reaches of the GI tract

28:24.112 --> 28:26.079
with a greater diversity of microbes.

28:26.114 --> 28:27.910
_

28:27.911 --> 28:32.173
_

28:32.174 --> 28:36.090
_

28:39.328 --> 28:42.195
Actually being able to see what
the BaAka eat and how they get it,

28:42.231 --> 28:45.398
helps explain some of the
findings in Dr. Gomez's research

28:45.433 --> 28:47.433
that lab science alone could not.

28:47.469 --> 28:49.502
This basic anthropological observation,

28:49.537 --> 28:50.837
combined with the fecal samples,

28:50.873 --> 28:52.072
helps paint a complete picture

28:52.107 --> 28:54.574
of the BaAka's microbial health,

28:54.609 --> 28:55.876
which could, in turn,

28:55.911 --> 28:57.911
help us restore or own
depleted modern guts

28:57.946 --> 28:59.612
to their original nature.

28:59.647 --> 29:01.481
With every advance

29:01.516 --> 29:04.017
comes a caveat, a sacrifice.

29:04.052 --> 29:07.653
So, we were able to
extend our lifespans,

29:07.689 --> 29:09.722
but at the same time,

29:09.758 --> 29:12.125
we have starved our microbiomes,

29:12.160 --> 29:15.227
and depletion of
diversity's correlated to...

29:15.263 --> 29:16.628
weakened immune systems.

29:16.663 --> 29:18.630
So, that's something we've lost then.

29:18.665 --> 29:20.732
We've lost them, and
the real question is,

29:20.768 --> 29:22.634
"Are we able to recover them back?"

29:22.669 --> 29:25.537
I think future generations
are gonna be enjoying

29:25.572 --> 29:29.074
the fruits of the things we're
doing right now with the microbiome.
