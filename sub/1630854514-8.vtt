Mrs. de Haan. This is, um--

CAMILLE DE HAAN:
Unorthodox, I know,

50:18.473 --> 50:21.101
but I need to speak with you.
May I come in?

50:21.184 --> 50:22.185
Uh...

50:25.647 --> 50:27.357
We need to talk
about Gossip Girl.

50:29.317 --> 50:31.570
After she cancelled Monet,

50:31.653 --> 50:33.864
there was a subtle shift
in my daughter.

50:33.947 --> 50:34.906
A thank you here,

50:34.990 --> 50:38.493
an air of heretofore
unseen humility there,

50:38.577 --> 50:42.956
but tonight she walked
into my study, hugged me...

50:44.499 --> 50:45.876
and told me she loved me.

50:47.335 --> 50:49.421
It appears Gossip Girl
has achieved

50:49.504 --> 50:52.758
what I have failed
to accomplish in 16 years.

50:52.841 --> 50:56.511
To instill respect.
She succeeded.

50:56.595 --> 50:58.096
I couldn't agree more.

51:01.475 --> 51:06.021
I was punitive when I learned
that teachers sent in tips.

51:06.104 --> 51:08.106
But I was mistaken.

51:08.190 --> 51:13.695
Going forward, I ask that you
and the other teachers

51:13.779 --> 51:18.325
continue to share your insights
with Gossip Girl.

51:18.408 --> 51:22.996
In return, you'll receive
cooperation from me,

51:23.079 --> 51:26.166
in any way you need.

51:26.249 --> 51:28.376
- Do we have a deal?
- I think we do.
