It felt weird
eating at Claudette's house

after her funeral.
It's a weird custom.

03:53.976 --> 03:57.069
Yeah.
It's to comfort the family,

03:57.238 --> 03:59.479
remember the deceased.

04:05.562 --> 04:08.080
It was my first time
going to her house.

04:08.231 --> 04:09.564
Meeting her family.
You know,

04:09.658 --> 04:12.066
I'm not sure if she'd
ever talked about them.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.569
Well, a lot of people
like to keep their work life

04:14.588 --> 04:15.587
and home life separate.

04:15.814 --> 04:17.981
MAY: I just always thought
she was this

04:18.000 --> 04:20.575
awful person who only existed

04:20.594 --> 04:22.002
to make my life hell.

04:22.154 --> 04:24.154
But she was a wife and a mom.

04:24.172 --> 04:25.764
She had a family that loved her.

04:25.915 --> 04:29.175
And if I hadn't gotten into
that argument with her...

04:29.270 --> 04:31.270
May, no.

04:32.273 --> 04:33.438
There's no way
you could have known

04:33.590 --> 04:35.590
that building was
gonna catch on fire.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.091
BOBBY: Your mother is right.
Whatever happened

04:37.111 --> 04:38.735
to Claudette is not your fault.

04:39.929 --> 04:42.656
Feels like it should be
somebody's fault.

<i> CHIMNEY:</i>
<i> Never understood these things.</i>

04:46.862 --> 04:48.453
You know?

04:48.680 --> 04:51.581
I mean, what are you supposed
to do with them after?

04:53.201 --> 04:54.776
I don't know,
put them in a drawer

04:54.795 --> 04:57.129
and throw them out
five years later?

04:57.280 --> 04:58.872
What were you even
doing at her funeral?

04:58.966 --> 05:00.999
Seemed like
the right thing to do.

05:01.226 --> 05:02.359
She died on our watch.

05:02.377 --> 05:03.543
It's not the first time that
that's happened.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.554
We don't normally
go to a funeral.

05:06.956 --> 05:08.140
Hen.

05:10.035 --> 05:11.435
All right.

05:13.480 --> 05:17.390
I had this crazy idea
in my mind.

05:17.543 --> 05:19.651
Some questions
about Claudette's death.

05:19.878 --> 05:22.988
So I went to the funeral
to try and get some answers.

05:23.215 --> 05:24.881
What kind of questions?

05:24.900 --> 05:27.826
Just didn't make any sense,
Chim. She was fine.

05:28.053 --> 05:30.053
And then she coded.

05:30.072 --> 05:32.289
And then she was dead.

05:33.225 --> 05:35.225
We see weird stuff every day.

05:35.318 --> 05:38.578
That's probably all this was.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.006
Except for the spiders.

05:41.157 --> 05:42.841
Are the spiders
where the crazy comes in?

05:43.068 --> 05:44.992
There was another call.
Right before

05:45.087 --> 05:46.736
you came back to work.
It was a kid

05:46.830 --> 05:50.423
<i> who had multiple tarantula</i>
<i> bites. He was stable.</i>

05:50.517 --> 05:54.168
<i> So I left him alone with Jonah</i>
<i> and then he coded.</i>

05:54.262 --> 05:56.096
Just like Claudette.

05:56.248 --> 05:58.765
It's most likely a coincidence.

05:58.917 --> 06:02.194
I mean, Claudette
had hypertension.

06:02.345 --> 06:04.754
How would you know that?

06:05.515 --> 06:07.199
I may have looked
in her medicine cabinet

06:07.350 --> 06:09.868
during the post-funeral
reception. But

06:10.095 --> 06:12.454
I... (sighs)

06:15.542 --> 06:17.784
High blood pressure.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.937
High blood pressure combined
with smoke inhalation

06:20.997 --> 06:22.272
would put a lot of stress
on the heart.

06:22.290 --> 06:24.699
Could cause a cardiac event.

06:24.793 --> 06:26.218
Exactly.

06:26.369 --> 06:28.387
Except...

06:28.614 --> 06:30.964
her BP would have been
stable at the scene.

06:31.116 --> 06:33.116
Wait, how do you know that?

06:33.118 --> 06:34.284
Because you did her assessment.

06:34.453 --> 06:35.952
If her vitals
hadn't been stable,

06:35.954 --> 06:37.896
you would've shipped her
out priority.

06:38.047 --> 06:39.472
I think you're
onto something here.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.899
You believe me.

06:41.050 --> 06:42.401
Always.

06:43.962 --> 06:44.811
Chris, hurry up.

06:44.963 --> 06:46.963
We still got to pick up
Tía Pepa.

06:46.982 --> 06:48.907
Shouldn't take that long
to pack a toothbrush.

06:49.134 --> 06:51.058
BUCK: Why don't you just
take a later flight?

06:51.153 --> 06:52.302
You were at a funeral, you know?

06:52.320 --> 06:54.996
Y-Your parents will understand.

06:55.732 --> 06:57.641
They should understand.

06:57.734 --> 07:01.953
What is the dress code
at a retirement party?

07:02.105 --> 07:03.146
Tie is probably too much.

07:03.165 --> 07:05.498
It is my parents
we're talking about.

07:05.651 --> 07:07.167
I'll just grab it all.

07:07.319 --> 07:10.411
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

07:10.505 --> 07:11.913
I have to go.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.490
My mom made this huge deal
about this party.

07:13.583 --> 07:16.342
He did work at the company
for 40 years.

07:16.495 --> 07:18.419
And Chris...

07:19.139 --> 07:20.997
He's excited to see everyone,
he misses them.

07:21.016 --> 07:23.275
40 years--that's a long time.

07:23.426 --> 07:25.444
Uh, you said
he was in oil, right?

07:25.671 --> 07:27.020
Petroleum engineer.

07:27.172 --> 07:29.172
Spent his whole life

07:29.191 --> 07:31.508
driving across the state.

07:31.526 --> 07:34.027
Living everywhere but under his
own roof with his own family.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.513
Listen, uh, as-as
someone who also

07:36.531 --> 07:38.348
comes from
a screwed-up family...

07:38.366 --> 07:40.459
My family isn't screwed up.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.520
Just my dad, okay?

07:43.538 --> 07:45.371
Plan is get in, get out
without any drama.

07:45.540 --> 07:47.707
Say congratulations,
have some cake and...

07:47.801 --> 07:49.283
(clicks tongue)
call it a day.

07:49.377 --> 07:52.954
And what about
when he starts to get in there

07:53.031 --> 07:54.714
and push your buttons?

07:54.866 --> 07:56.716
There's a hotel 20 minutes away,
three-and-a-half stars.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.868
Chris is really gonna
like the pool.

07:58.887 --> 08:00.645
Chris!

CHIMNEY (whispers):
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

08:08.897 --> 08:11.472
Can't believe you're having
us break into Cap's office.

08:11.533 --> 08:12.716
HEN:
All right.

08:13.476 --> 08:16.328
All right, come on, Chim.
We need to find a copy

08:16.479 --> 08:18.238
of the paramedic transfer forms

08:18.390 --> 08:20.573
that Jonah submitted
for Claudette and Perry,

08:20.667 --> 08:21.983
our spider bite pet sitter,

08:22.002 --> 08:24.227
see Jonah's account
of what happened to them.

08:24.246 --> 08:26.079
Or we could log on
to the computer,

08:26.231 --> 08:27.897
pull up Jonah's personnel file.

08:28.032 --> 08:29.582
-Here.
-Oh, how are you
gonna get in there?

08:29.735 --> 08:31.510
Did you become a computer hacker
while you were gone?

08:31.737 --> 08:34.254
Well, I was living
in a basement, but...

08:34.422 --> 08:37.516
not exactly dealing with
the Enigma machine here.

08:41.504 --> 08:42.562

Dallas, Denver,

And what's with all the 902Ms?

10:30.297 --> 10:32.631
Oh, we were just,
uh, working on...

10:32.782 --> 10:34.299
A special project for the mayor.

10:34.450 --> 10:37.284
W... Seriously?
Well, what kind of project?

10:37.379 --> 10:40.864
Beta testing a new piece
of equipment for us to use

10:40.882 --> 10:44.142
in the field.
We just needed to, uh,

10:44.369 --> 10:46.719
go over some of the data
from our transfer forms.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.980
-Just need data.
-LUCY: Data.

10:49.207 --> 10:51.224
Sounds official.

is gonna want that report ASAP.

10:55.547 --> 10:56.971
-Have a great shift.
-CHIMNEY: See ya.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.325
-You're a terrible liar.
-And you're too good.

11:00.476 --> 11:02.235
What do you think
they're hiding?

11:02.387 --> 11:05.372
'Round here,
I find it's best not to know.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.671
What are we doing?

11:12.822 --> 11:15.322
I'm rummaging through
a dead woman's medicine cabinet.

11:15.417 --> 11:18.234
I've got you breaking
into the captain's office,

11:18.327 --> 11:20.904
looking at confidential
personnel files.

11:20.997 --> 11:23.256
We're trying to prove
whether or not

11:23.350 --> 11:25.758
Jonah was a bad paramedic.

11:25.911 --> 11:27.352
What if we're wrong?

11:27.503 --> 11:29.170
What if we're not?

11:29.264 --> 11:31.080
He's out there right now.

11:31.099 --> 11:32.415
<i> Someone's calling for help,</i>

11:32.434 --> 11:34.417
<i> and that guy's gonna show up?</i>

11:34.436 --> 11:36.695
<i> He's holding their lives</i>
<i> in his hands,</i>

11:36.846 --> 11:38.938
and we don't know
what he's gonna do with them.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.700
Why don't I give you
something for the pain?

11:43.611 --> 11:46.538
You sure that's okay?

11:46.707 --> 11:49.040
Trust me.

11:58.293 --> 12:00.276
Oh, something's wrong.

12:00.295 --> 12:01.961
EDDIE:
(grunts) I haven't even

12:02.113 --> 12:04.973
shut off the engine.
(groans)

12:06.468 --> 12:08.468
-PEPA: Mami.
-Hi.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.286
PEPA:
<i> ¿Que paso?</i>

12:10.379 --> 12:11.879
Nada.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.380
Where's Christopher?

12:13.475 --> 12:16.383
Out like a light ever since
we left the car rental place.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.236
<i> Ay, pobrecito mi angelito.</i>

12:18.387 --> 12:19.145
(chuckles)

12:19.297 --> 12:20.905
Abuela, it's so good to see you.

12:21.132 --> 12:23.466
L.A. feels a little less
like home without you there.

12:23.559 --> 12:24.650
Same here.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.077
-Mm.
-PEPA: So, now,

12:26.229 --> 12:28.471
what's wrong?

12:28.564 --> 12:30.823
Your mother is in there
doing all the cooking.

12:30.976 --> 12:32.066
PEPA:
What?

12:32.085 --> 12:33.309
I thought my fancy brother

12:33.478 --> 12:35.328
hired caterers for
his big<i> parranda.</i>

12:35.480 --> 12:37.404
The caterers are only allowed

12:37.499 --> 12:39.816
to warm and serve the food.
Helena insisted

12:39.818 --> 12:42.260
on making everything herself.

12:42.487 --> 12:44.095
-(Pepa sighs)
-Everything.

12:44.322 --> 12:46.431
You didn't help out at all?

12:47.267 --> 12:49.416
I was allowed
to make the tamales.

12:49.511 --> 12:52.753
-PEPA: Ay, gracias.
-(laughing)

12:52.847 --> 12:55.348
Thank you.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.693
-I'm gonna go wake Chris, okay?
-ISABEL: Yes, of course.

13:01.264 --> 13:03.430
EDDIE:
Mom, come on.
You got to take a break.

13:03.599 --> 13:05.842
No, leave me alone,
I'm almost done.

13:05.860 --> 13:07.176
-Everything looks perfect.
-Yeah, okay.

13:07.270 --> 13:08.936
I'm sure it tastes great, too.

13:09.030 --> 13:10.121
-(smack)
-I'm kidding.

13:10.273 --> 13:12.439
It's so good to have my boys
back home.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.275
RAMON:
It's been too long.
You should come visit

13:14.443 --> 13:15.868
-more often.
-EDDIE: Pretty sure planes

13:16.021 --> 13:17.687
-fly in both directions.
-Well, now that

13:17.705 --> 13:19.631
your father's retired,
we'll have time to visit more.

13:19.858 --> 13:22.041
-Yeah, I can't believe
it's actually happening.
-HELENA: Oh, God.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.693
Oh, did you show him the watch?

13:23.786 --> 13:25.619
-RAMON: Oh, it's nothing.
-HELENA: No, no show him.

13:25.713 --> 13:28.622
-It was a nice gesture.
-(Ramon groans)
-Show me.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.726
Here, it's... (chuckles)

13:33.313 --> 13:34.628
Wow.

13:34.722 --> 13:37.798
"In recognition
of your 40 years of service

13:37.818 --> 13:40.726

new horizons for our company,

13:40.895 --> 13:42.228
"and for all

13:42.305 --> 13:43.229
"the board thanks you.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.156
From our family to yours."

13:45.308 --> 13:47.325
It's not quite a Silver Star.

13:48.386 --> 13:51.478
But it-but it's something...
I guess.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.907
Ah, it's, uh, nice.
Congratulations, Dad.

13:55.060 --> 13:56.893
(box lightly thumps)

13:56.986 --> 13:58.728
Feels strange.

13:58.821 --> 14:00.746
Being unemployed, it's...

14:00.823 --> 14:02.081
No meetings to rush off to.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.566
No phone calls to juggle.

14:03.568 --> 14:07.253
No... no reason
to get out of bed at 4:00 A.M.

14:07.405 --> 14:09.848
I-I... I don't know
what I'm gonna do with myself.

14:10.075 --> 14:11.332
I bet.

14:12.093 --> 14:14.435
(mutters):
Why live if you're not working?

14:16.189 --> 14:19.107
RAMON:
So, how's life as an operator?

14:22.087 --> 14:23.528
<i> ATHENA:</i>
<i> Love you.</i>

14:23.755 --> 14:25.271
<i> All right, talk to you</i>
<i> in the morning?</i>

14:25.365 --> 14:27.423
Okay, bye-bye.

14:27.516 --> 14:30.593
How many times are you planning
to check on May?

14:31.279 --> 14:33.872
(sighs)
Until I'm sure she's okay.

14:34.023 --> 14:36.374
Mm. That you're both okay.

14:36.601 --> 14:39.785
Oh, it's my turn
in the hot seat now.

14:39.862 --> 14:41.437
You pulled a woman out of a fire

14:41.530 --> 14:43.940
and then she died
in front of you at the hospital.

14:44.033 --> 14:45.942
I know that's not easy.

14:46.628 --> 14:49.112
Her husband came to find me
at the funeral.

14:49.130 --> 14:52.539
Wanted to shake my hand,
thank me for doing what I could.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.283
What'd you say?

14:54.302 --> 14:57.061
That I wish
I could've done more.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.806
But there has to be something
you can do, right?

15:00.959 --> 15:02.734
Chimney and I
put in a few calls,

15:02.885 --> 15:05.962
talked to some other paramedics
that Jonah worked with.

15:06.055 --> 15:07.388
Almost everyone
says the same thing.

15:07.556 --> 15:10.408
That he's a little odd,
that he's overeager,

15:10.577 --> 15:13.319
but he's a good paramedic.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.303
Almost?

15:14.397 --> 15:17.916
Well... there was this one guy

15:18.067 --> 15:19.400
over at the 122--

15:19.419 --> 15:22.236
him and Jonah
responded to a fender bender.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.163
-Mm-hmm.
-They were treating the driver

15:24.257 --> 15:27.166
for a concussion
and some airbag abrasions.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.835
He left Jonah alone
with the driver.

15:29.988 --> 15:31.078
And when he came back,

15:31.097 --> 15:34.098
the driver was in full arrest.

15:34.325 --> 15:36.100
He died on the scene.

15:38.421 --> 15:41.105
Okay, babe, once is a mistake.

15:41.182 --> 15:42.181
Twice is a coincidence.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.500
Three times is a pattern.

15:44.593 --> 15:47.428
-You need to tell someone.
-I don't have any proof.

15:47.596 --> 15:51.190
I file a complaint,
he denies it, moves on

15:51.342 --> 15:53.693
and becomes some other
department's problem.

15:53.845 --> 15:55.269
-Okay, well, what about
those other cities?
-Well,

15:55.363 --> 15:57.680
if he'd had a trail
of suspicious deaths,

15:57.773 --> 16:00.107
I don't think the LAFD
would've hired him.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.701
Well, doesn't have to be deaths.

16:01.777 --> 16:04.370
Just a pattern
of suspicious behavior.

16:04.522 --> 16:07.632
I mean, nobody
starts with murder.

16:10.378 --> 16:12.712
<i> -(knocking)</i>
<i> -CHIMNEY: Hang on, I'm coming.</i>

16:13.473 --> 16:15.974
They never start with murder.

16:17.418 --> 16:19.811
I'm sorry, Pat,
I'm gonna need to buy a vowel.

16:20.038 --> 16:21.204
Murderers.

16:21.222 --> 16:23.389
They never start with murder.

16:23.541 --> 16:24.557
People like Jonah,

16:24.651 --> 16:28.135
they always have
some kind of origin story.

16:28.989 --> 16:31.897
"The mayor called
13-year-old Jonah Greenway

16:32.050 --> 16:33.474
"a 'hometown hero'

16:33.568 --> 16:36.068
"for successfully resuscitating
his school bus driver

16:36.162 --> 16:38.645
after a heart attack
behind the wheel."

16:38.665 --> 16:40.056
So Jonah was, like, a kid hero?

16:40.149 --> 16:42.816
Yeah, th-there's dozens
of-of articles, interviews.

16:42.910 --> 16:44.985
They gave him
the damn key to the city

16:45.005 --> 16:46.820
and paid for college.

16:46.914 --> 16:50.416
Saving that driver made him
an overnight celebrity.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.401
I got full of myself after
I'd ace an English test.

16:52.403 --> 16:53.994
I can't imagine
what something like this

16:54.014 --> 16:55.404
would do to a kid's ego.

16:55.423 --> 16:58.182
Or how he'd feel
when the attention went away.

16:58.409 --> 17:00.576
He'd probably
miss the adulation.

17:00.595 --> 17:01.911
So much so that maybe

17:02.004 --> 17:05.339
he'd try to recreate
the experience.

17:05.433 --> 17:07.099
Over and over.

17:07.252 --> 17:09.101
A malignant hero.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.561
He didn't want to kill people.

17:10.788 --> 17:12.421
He wanted to push them
to the brink of death

17:12.440 --> 17:15.867
so that he could have
the glory of saving them.

17:15.943 --> 17:18.036
You could only do that
for so long before you slip up.

17:18.187 --> 17:19.686
People would start to suspect.

17:19.706 --> 17:23.357
And then you move on,
from city to city.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.710
Miami, Chicago,

17:25.861 --> 17:27.528
Dallas, Denver...

17:27.622 --> 17:28.788
Los Angeles.

17:28.940 --> 17:30.531
We've been doing
all this sleuthing

17:30.625 --> 17:33.776
and he's been hiding in
plain sight on the local news.

17:33.869 --> 17:36.387
He still is.

17:37.465 --> 17:39.557
(knocking)

17:41.803 --> 17:44.062
Uh, hi.
Is everything okay?

-Sorry, I-I know it's early.
-TAYLOR: Yeah.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.646
It was even earlier
when she woke me up.

17:53.798 --> 17:56.056
HEN:
We were hoping that,
uh, we could watch

17:56.076 --> 17:58.484
some of your footage
from the call center fire.

17:58.636 --> 18:01.821
Is that something
you could access from here?

18:01.915 --> 18:04.140
Theoretically... yes.

18:04.233 --> 18:06.733
-Why?
-Yeah.

18:07.495 --> 18:09.754
Well, theoretically,
I want to see

18:09.905 --> 18:12.148
what happened
before Claudette coded.

18:12.241 --> 18:15.075
The dispatcher who died
on her way to the hospital?

18:15.095 --> 18:17.320
I-Is something going on,

18:17.322 --> 18:19.430
did the family make a complaint?

18:20.433 --> 18:23.768
Yeah, it's-it's fine, Buck,
I'm happy to help.

18:23.919 --> 18:25.269
Why don't you
make us some coffee?

18:25.421 --> 18:27.522
I'm sure we all could use a cup.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.608
Is this what
you're looking for?

18:30.759 --> 18:32.852
<i> -(both laugh)</i>
<i> -JONAH: You know,</i>

18:34.948 --> 18:37.840
It's crazy-- she-she seems fine.

18:37.859 --> 18:40.660
How do you go from laughing
one second to coding the next?

18:40.769 --> 18:43.270
Wait a minute.
Can you rewind?

18:43.364 --> 18:44.271
Yeah.

18:44.365 --> 18:46.273
HEN:
Stop it right there.

18:46.367 --> 18:48.108
CHIMNEY:
What do you think that is--

18:48.128 --> 18:49.794
-potassium?
-HEN: I'm not sure.

18:50.021 --> 18:53.356
O-Okay, come on, guys,
wh-what's going on here?

18:53.374 --> 18:55.207
Buck, we're not sure.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.801
BUCK:
We're not gonna tell anyone.

18:57.028 --> 18:58.469
Right?

18:59.455 --> 19:01.139
Off the record.

19:02.383 --> 19:04.809
Claudette was alert
and conversant.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.145
Her BP and her heart rate
were stable.

19:07.296 --> 19:10.539
Protocol dictates that the only
treatment necessary in that case

19:10.558 --> 19:12.966
is respiratory,
to treat the smoke inhalation.

19:13.060 --> 19:14.560
-Meaning?
-HEN: Meaning

19:14.654 --> 19:18.639
Jonah had no reason
to push drugs of any kind.

19:18.733 --> 19:21.492
Are you saying her death
wasn't related to her injuries?

19:21.569 --> 19:24.069
Whatever drug Jonah was pushing
on that video

19:24.164 --> 19:25.163
caused her heart to stop.

19:25.314 --> 19:27.665
What... on-on purpose?

19:28.559 --> 19:31.410
-Maybe.
-Come on, Hen, I... I-I know you

19:31.562 --> 19:33.654
didn't always like the guy,
but he-he's still one of us,

19:33.822 --> 19:36.323
you know? It cou-it could've
just been a mistake.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.250
Buck, did that look like
a mistake to you?

19:38.327 --> 19:41.995
He injected her with something,
and she had a heart attack.

19:42.131 --> 19:44.089
How-how can you be sure?

19:44.166 --> 19:45.908
CHIMNEY:
Claudette wasn't the first time.

19:45.927 --> 19:47.743
Other people have died
on his watch

19:47.762 --> 19:49.595
under suspicious circumstances.

19:49.747 --> 19:53.249
Okay, so-so, maybe
he's a-he's a bad paramedic.

19:53.267 --> 19:55.693
Or maybe he is a serial killer.

20:24.465 --> 20:26.057
-Oh, what?
-EDDIE: Yeah, come on,

20:26.284 --> 20:28.559
Aunt Pepa's right. I'm sure
there's a story you could tell.

20:28.711 --> 20:30.711
Actually, I was
gonna tell one about you.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.380
You know, the-the day
I came home and found that

20:33.399 --> 20:35.958
-the entire side of my truck
had been scraped off,
-HELENA: Oh.

20:35.977 --> 20:38.236
-including the side mirror
and the front bumper.
-HELENA: Oh, my gosh,

20:38.387 --> 20:40.053
yes, when Adriana was born.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.480
You never told me about that.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.132
When Adriana was born,

20:43.225 --> 20:44.742
and, uh, Ramon
was off on business,

20:44.893 --> 20:46.819
I told that Eddie
that my water broke.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.471
And he jumped up, he ran

20:48.564 --> 20:49.896
out of the room,
and I thought, of course,

20:50.065 --> 20:50.973
he's going to call someone

20:51.066 --> 20:52.416
to drive us to the hospital.

20:52.568 --> 20:54.234
And then I hear a loud

20:54.254 --> 20:56.662
-crash, right? From the garage.
-Ah.

20:56.814 --> 20:59.164
I walk in there,
there's Eddie behind the wheel

20:59.317 --> 21:01.908
of Ramon's prized pickup.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.319
Barely seeing over
the steering wheel,

21:03.412 --> 21:05.263
with the whole side
of the truck, like, just

21:05.414 --> 21:07.431
completely torn to shreds.

21:07.583 --> 21:09.934
-(chuckling)
-He was trying to drive me
to the hospital.

21:10.161 --> 21:12.270
Why I'm not surprised, huh?

21:12.421 --> 21:14.755
Eddie to the rescue,
my little hero.

21:14.849 --> 21:16.348
Didn't have much of a choice.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.091
Ah, you had many choices.

21:18.185 --> 21:21.504
-But you were just a kid,
I-I forgave you for that.
-EDDIE: No,

21:21.597 --> 21:24.765
-actually, you didn't.
you-you grounded me.
-Edmundo,

21:24.859 --> 21:26.266
-it's-it's just a story.
-Yeah,

21:26.286 --> 21:27.676
it's a real sweet one. I...

21:27.695 --> 21:29.620
Except he's just...
he's missing the whole part

21:29.789 --> 21:32.439
where he tore me a new one
for ruining his truck.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.183
You know, kind of like the time
he yelled at me

21:34.276 --> 21:35.200
for setting off the smoke alarms

21:35.353 --> 21:37.186
for making eggs for the girls

21:37.204 --> 21:38.871
-when I was 12. I'm sure
-Edmundo.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.965
there's a better story
you can tell up there.

21:41.192 --> 21:43.025
Oh, uh, why don't you
tell them about the time

21:43.044 --> 21:44.302
you pulled your
ten-year-old son aside

21:44.453 --> 21:46.879
and told him it was time
to step up?

21:46.973 --> 21:48.213
Be the man of the house?

21:48.308 --> 21:50.791
Why don't you tell them
about that time?

21:50.885 --> 21:54.053
Then we can all understand
why you were never around.

21:54.205 --> 21:56.705
I was providing for the family.

21:56.724 --> 21:57.873
Providing?

21:57.875 --> 22:00.151
(laughs):
Providing what-- money?

22:00.302 --> 22:01.468
-HELENA: Okay...
-Exactly.

22:01.562 --> 22:03.321
I had to do
what I had to do.

22:03.472 --> 22:05.230
A family needs more than money.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.049
Look, I never had a childhood,

22:07.218 --> 22:09.552
a dad who took care of me.
No, you were gone.

22:09.570 --> 22:11.144
-The only thing you provided...
-HELENA: Okay,

22:11.164 --> 22:13.222
-Eddie, Eddie, stop, stop.
-Ramon!
-Ramon, Ramon.

22:13.315 --> 22:16.667
-Dad? Dad. Okay, just breathe.
-ISABEL:<i> Mijo, mijo.</i>

22:16.836 --> 22:18.336
-Oh my God, Ramon.
-Breathe.

22:18.412 --> 22:19.337
(panting)

22:19.564 --> 22:22.340
HELENA:
Is he having a heart attack?

22:25.252 --> 22:28.012
No, it's not a heart attack.
All right.

22:28.163 --> 22:29.405
Open your mouth,
under your tongue.

22:29.498 --> 22:30.997
-You know the drill.
-HELENA: What-what drill?

22:31.017 --> 22:33.242
-What are-what are these pills?
-Nitroglycerin.

22:33.260 --> 22:35.594
It helps open up
his blood vessels,

22:35.688 --> 22:37.855
settles the circulation.

22:39.007 --> 22:41.266
Just like the doctor said,
am I right?

22:41.419 --> 22:43.752
-HELENA: What doctor?
-ISABEL: What's going on?

22:43.754 --> 22:45.604
Ramon, what did you do?

22:45.698 --> 22:48.591
I'm guessing you went
to go see a cardiologist.

22:48.684 --> 22:51.518
Probably on one of your
business trips, am I right?

22:52.430 --> 22:55.998
How many stents do you have
in your arteries?

22:57.101 --> 22:58.542
HELENA:
What?

22:59.379 --> 23:00.861
When?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.121
Three years ago.

23:02.273 --> 23:04.940
I... I went to Dr. Fernandez.

23:05.033 --> 23:07.109
He's the finest
cardiologist in Dallas.

23:07.128 --> 23:09.628
Why didn't you tell me?

23:09.722 --> 23:11.389
Pride.

23:11.557 --> 23:14.517
He didn't want us
to think he was weak.

23:16.303 --> 23:17.970
<i> JONAH (on laptop):</i>
<i> You know, I'd say</i>
<i> you don't really have, uh,</i>

23:18.064 --> 23:20.456
<i> -the looks to be</i>
<i> a phone operator.</i>
-You're sure about this?

23:20.474 --> 23:22.808
(sighs) C... I'm not sure
what was in that syringe,

23:22.977 --> 23:25.477
-(recording stops)
-but it sent her
into cardiac arrest.

23:25.630 --> 23:27.888
And it seems like the guy's
got a history of this.

23:27.982 --> 23:29.648
BOBBY:
It's not that I don't
believe you guys,

23:29.800 --> 23:31.984
but these are huge accusations.

23:32.136 --> 23:34.227
Do you think there's a way
we can prove it?

23:35.063 --> 23:37.489
Claudette's autopsy.
The toxicology report

23:37.642 --> 23:40.309
is still pending.
If we can get it expedited,

23:40.402 --> 23:41.994
we can see if there was
anything in her blood

23:42.088 --> 23:44.088
-that shouldn't have been there.
-You think this is

23:44.315 --> 23:47.316
some kind of
angel of mercy killing?

23:48.243 --> 23:50.261
Putting people
out of their supposed misery?

23:50.488 --> 23:53.505
I think it's
more complicated than that.

23:54.434 --> 23:57.326
This guy's bringing people
to the point of death

23:57.419 --> 24:00.663
and then using his skills
to bring them back.

24:00.756 --> 24:03.015
Whe-When he was a kid, he...

24:03.109 --> 24:05.334
he got to play the hero.

24:05.427 --> 24:07.820
Now he wants to play God.

24:08.005 --> 24:09.429
(sighs)

24:09.449 --> 24:12.633
<i> TAYLOR:</i>
<i> No, I am telling you,</i>
<i> this is big.</i>

24:12.693 --> 24:14.359
I, um...

24:14.512 --> 24:15.844
Yeah, just, um... just

24:15.938 --> 24:18.363
take a look at the file
and see what you can find out.

24:18.516 --> 24:19.865
That'd be great.
Thanks, bye.

24:20.017 --> 24:22.293
Hey, uh, what, uh,
what are you doing?

24:22.520 --> 24:24.378
Work stuff.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.115
Really?

24:29.210 --> 24:30.617
Buck, it's fascinating.

24:30.636 --> 24:31.860
It's terrifying.

24:31.954 --> 24:34.287
You-you know you can't
run this story, right?

24:34.456 --> 24:35.714
You can't blame me
for wanting to.

24:35.866 --> 24:37.199
We don't even know
if it's true.

24:37.292 --> 24:38.291
And if it is,
you can't tell it 'cause Jonah

24:38.385 --> 24:39.718
will know we're onto him.

24:39.870 --> 24:41.704
That's gonna put people
in harm's way.

24:41.797 --> 24:43.555
They're already in harm's way.

24:43.708 --> 24:45.724
How many calls do you think
he's going to respond to

24:45.876 --> 24:48.152
between now
and whenever they stop him?

24:48.303 --> 24:50.546
Hen said she was
gonna go to Bobby.

24:50.564 --> 24:53.882
-Bobby will do something.
-I can do something.

24:53.976 --> 24:56.235
No, you can't.

24:56.329 --> 24:58.721
Off the record, remember?

24:58.739 --> 25:00.072
Yeah.

25:00.224 --> 25:02.625
Promise me.

25:04.562 --> 25:06.837
I promise.

25:06.989 --> 25:08.964
I won't run the story.

25:22.355 --> 25:26.565
RAMON:
It's been much longer than
five minutes. I feel fine.

25:27.434 --> 25:29.175
Strong, right?

25:29.195 --> 25:31.436
(music playing in distance)

25:31.589 --> 25:33.030
Yeah.

25:34.091 --> 25:35.941
I had one myself.

25:36.093 --> 25:39.019
Not a heart attack,
but a panic attack.

25:39.113 --> 25:40.946
Ended up in the E.R.

25:41.098 --> 25:42.614
Why didn't you tell us?

25:42.767 --> 25:45.601
Pretty sure you know
the answer to that question.

25:45.619 --> 25:48.379
You didn't want to...

25:48.530 --> 25:50.130
seem weak, either.

25:55.037 --> 25:57.596
I spent my whole life
trying not to be like you.

25:59.300 --> 26:02.968
All these years, I, uh...

26:03.137 --> 26:04.895
I tried to...

26:05.047 --> 26:07.456
set a good example for you.

26:07.474 --> 26:09.975
Maybe... maybe it was
the wrong one, I don't know.

26:10.127 --> 26:12.644
But I never understood
why you were so angry with me.

26:12.797 --> 26:15.239
I-I... Why it always felt like

26:15.316 --> 26:17.633
you were punishing me.

26:18.393 --> 26:20.494
Think I was
punishing myself more.

26:21.396 --> 26:23.706
But I'm tired of being that guy.

26:25.492 --> 26:27.993
I'm going to be better.

26:28.070 --> 26:30.129
-For Christopher.
-Mm.

26:31.482 --> 26:32.998
For myself.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.000
Maybe we can...

26:35.094 --> 26:38.095
we can both be better.

26:39.506 --> 26:40.598
I don't want to miss out

26:40.825 --> 26:45.019
on any more of my son's life.

26:55.430 --> 26:56.989
I'd like that.

26:58.509 --> 26:59.724
(pats hand)

26:59.860 --> 27:02.036
All right, thanks.

27:05.699 --> 27:08.459
-Chim leave?
-HEN: Yeah, he had to go home.

27:08.610 --> 27:12.112
-Maddie was
dropping off Jee-Yun.
-ATHENA: Uh, Bobby,

27:12.131 --> 27:13.613
wh-what did the chief say?

27:13.633 --> 27:15.858
They've opened an investigation
into Claudette's death.

27:15.951 --> 27:18.135
Jonah's been put on light duty
pending the results.

27:18.362 --> 27:21.096
(sighs) That's a relief.

27:22.199 --> 27:23.866
Thanks, Bobby.

27:23.884 --> 27:24.867
Yeah.

27:24.885 --> 27:27.719
Hen, be careful.

27:27.872 --> 27:29.872
If Jonah is who you think he is,

27:29.965 --> 27:33.542
he won't take kindly
to being exposed.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.486
<i> (ringtone plays)</i>

27:35.637 --> 27:37.137
<i> HEN:</i>
<i> Hello?</i>

27:37.156 --> 27:39.639
<i> JONAH:</i>
<i> I heard you've been</i>
<i> asking people about me.</i>

27:39.733 --> 27:41.175
Jonah?

27:41.177 --> 27:43.476
Got the weirdest call.

27:43.570 --> 27:44.995
<i> They've opened</i>
<i> an investigation</i>

27:45.147 --> 27:47.239
<i> into what happened</i>
<i> to that dispatcher.</i>

27:47.333 --> 27:49.667
Did you file a complaint
against me, Henrietta?

27:49.818 --> 27:53.578
Jonah, I don't-I don't know
what you think is going on...

27:53.731 --> 27:56.748
<i> I think you never</i>
<i> gave me a chance, Hen.</i>

27:56.901 --> 27:58.250
<i> To prove myself.</i>

27:58.402 --> 28:00.511
<i> To show you</i>
<i> what I'm capable of.</i>

28:00.662 --> 28:04.473
But, hey, I'm not a guy
who gives up easy.

28:05.333 --> 28:08.435
<i> So I'm gonna do that now.</i>

28:10.597 --> 28:12.981
I'm gonna show you.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.442
(hangs up)

28:17.938 --> 28:19.154
(ringtone playing)

28:21.367 --> 28:23.108
Hey, baby, I was
just about to call you.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.777
<i> HEN:</i>
<i> Get out of the house.</i>
<i> Don't pack a bag.</i>

28:25.930 --> 28:29.264
Just take Ma and Denny and
go over to Bobby and Athena's.

28:29.283 --> 28:31.450
-What?
-K-Karen, please.

28:31.618 --> 28:33.377
Uh, Denny, come here.

28:33.546 --> 28:34.953
Uh, your mom's not here,
she's out with Clive.

28:35.105 --> 28:37.548
Okay, call her as soon as
we get off the phone

28:37.775 --> 28:38.957
and tell her do not come home.

28:39.109 --> 28:41.777
-What's going on?
-Uh, put your shoes on, and, uh,

28:41.795 --> 28:43.278
<i> and get your backpack,</i>
<i> and we're going out.</i>

28:43.297 --> 28:46.206
-Now? Where?
-Yes. I'll explain in the car.

28:46.300 --> 28:48.133
Hen, tell me what's going on.

28:48.285 --> 28:50.635
Jonah called. He knows that
I turned him in, and I'm just,

28:50.788 --> 28:52.471
<i> I'm just worried</i>
<i> he's gonna do something.</i>

28:52.623 --> 28:54.806
What, you think he'd come here?
Why? What did he say?

28:54.975 --> 28:56.883
He said that
I didn't give him a chance

28:56.902 --> 28:58.627
<i> and-and that</i>
<i> he was gonna show me.</i>

28:58.720 --> 28:59.886
Sounded like some kind of

28:59.980 --> 29:01.797
jilted lover or something.

29:01.815 --> 29:02.889
<i> He sounded jealous.</i>

29:02.983 --> 29:05.367
Well, this doesn't
make any sense.

29:06.303 --> 29:07.393
<i> Hen.</i>

29:07.488 --> 29:10.998
I'm not the one
Jonah would be jealous of.

29:14.328 --> 29:16.044
Chimney?

29:17.923 --> 29:20.132
Chimney?

29:23.429 --> 29:25.053
(phone clicks)

29:25.948 --> 29:28.098
(texting)

29:29.827 --> 29:31.676
Aah! No...

29:31.829 --> 29:33.729
(grunts)

29:46.768 --> 29:48.860
(monitor beeping steadily)

29:48.954 --> 29:50.579
Aah!

29:51.290 --> 29:52.498
No...

29:54.034 --> 29:55.959
(Hen grunts)

29:57.797 --> 29:59.630
(slurping)

30:04.194 --> 30:06.303
(distant): Ah.

30:06.454 --> 30:08.213
Hey there.

30:08.365 --> 30:10.532
Glad you could join us.

30:11.702 --> 30:14.627
(normal volume): You were out
slightly longer than I expected.

30:14.721 --> 30:17.797
I guess I was just a little
too generous with the propofol.

30:17.891 --> 30:19.041
(Hen grunts softly)

30:19.059 --> 30:21.401
I'll try to be
more careful next time.

30:23.547 --> 30:27.049
Why are you
doing this, Jonah?

30:27.067 --> 30:29.051
I guess the easiest answer

30:29.069 --> 30:30.810
is because I can.

30:30.830 --> 30:34.406
You can get anything you want
on the Internet these days.

30:34.575 --> 30:36.834
Medical equipment.

30:37.061 --> 30:39.044
Drugs.

30:39.839 --> 30:41.880
The real answer is...

30:42.733 --> 30:44.157
...you gave me no choice.

30:44.176 --> 30:47.085
Snooping around,
checking up on me?

30:47.237 --> 30:50.589
We're supposed to be
on the same team, Henrietta.

30:50.665 --> 30:54.101
We're definitely not
on the same team.

30:55.170 --> 30:58.246
Oh, I think we are.

30:58.265 --> 31:00.190
Now, you and this guy? Eh.

31:00.342 --> 31:03.026
HEN:
We don't put our patients' lives

31:03.103 --> 31:06.363
in danger just for our own ego.

31:06.514 --> 31:08.090
You put your hand
inside someone's chest,

31:08.108 --> 31:09.441
for Pete's sake.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.184
If that's not ego,

31:11.203 --> 31:13.261
-I don't know what is.
-The patient

31:13.280 --> 31:15.205
would have died if I hadn't...

31:15.357 --> 31:16.915
One sec.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.117
HEN:
No, J-Jonah, please.

31:19.286 --> 31:20.602
-No...
-Relax.

31:20.604 --> 31:23.105
-No... No, Jonah.
-It's just a little adenosine.

31:23.123 --> 31:24.214
You're stopping his heart.

31:24.441 --> 31:26.199
Don't worry, I'll get it back.

31:26.293 --> 31:29.678
Nothing some epinephrine
can't fix.

31:31.115 --> 31:32.806
(Hen gasping)

31:33.708 --> 31:34.950
-(monitor flatlines)
-No, no!

31:35.119 --> 31:37.394
Please, no.

31:37.621 --> 31:39.137
Oh, God. No!

31:39.289 --> 31:40.713
Guess we got to shock.

31:40.733 --> 31:42.065
(whirrs)

31:43.961 --> 31:47.362
Oh! Come on.
Come on, Chim, come on.

31:49.316 --> 31:50.073
(whoops)

31:50.300 --> 31:52.576
There's nothing like it, right?

31:52.727 --> 31:55.971
The rush of watching someone
walk right up to death's door

31:55.989 --> 31:58.415
and snatching them right back?

31:58.566 --> 32:00.492
It's like being God.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.711
We are not God!

32:03.756 --> 32:05.339
Aren't we?

32:06.166 --> 32:08.675
Okay, excited to see Daddy?

32:10.596 --> 32:13.838
Hey, Chim, we're here.

32:13.933 --> 32:16.491
Chim?

32:16.493 --> 32:18.584
(phone vibrating,
ringtone playing)

32:18.679 --> 32:20.345
Okay.

32:20.497 --> 32:22.689
(vibrating, ringtone
continue in distance)

32:31.358 --> 32:32.674
(grunts)

32:32.767 --> 32:34.176
Karen?

32:34.269 --> 32:35.953
<i> Maddie? Where's Chimney?</i>

32:36.121 --> 32:38.013
I-I don't know. I...

32:38.031 --> 32:40.031
just brought Jee here,
but he's not here.

32:40.184 --> 32:41.700
<i> But his phone is.</i>

32:41.776 --> 32:42.960
Is Hen with you?

32:43.128 --> 32:44.869
-Wait, is she supposed to be?
<i> -Well, she was afraid</i>

32:45.022 --> 32:46.779
Chimney might be in danger,
so she went to the apartment

32:46.799 --> 32:48.190
to check on him.

32:48.283 --> 32:49.782
Why-why would he be in danger?

32:49.876 --> 32:52.027
<i> Well, there's this paramedic</i>
<i>that was working for a few weeks</i>

32:52.045 --> 32:54.012
<i> with Hen at the 118.</i>

32:55.199 --> 32:57.457
Um, I have to go.

32:57.534 --> 32:59.217
-What?
<i> -Yeah,</i>

32:59.369 --> 33:01.203
I-I need to get Jee
out of here and call 911.

33:01.221 --> 33:02.145
Do you think she's right?

33:02.297 --> 33:03.480
Chimney's in danger?

33:03.707 --> 33:05.373
<i> I don't know,</i>
<i> I think they both are.</i>

33:05.467 --> 33:07.901
HEN (crying):
Jonah, listen.

33:08.729 --> 33:11.730
Your beef is with me, okay?

33:11.882 --> 33:13.824
Plea-Please let Chimney go.

33:13.900 --> 33:15.884
Please.

33:15.886 --> 33:17.977
Okay.

33:17.997 --> 33:20.813
(breathing shakily)

33:20.833 --> 33:23.225
What...

33:23.318 --> 33:26.986
No, no, no, no. Jonah, Jonah.

33:27.080 --> 33:28.171
Jonah, please.

33:28.323 --> 33:31.174
No, plea-please, please,
Jonah. Please.

33:31.326 --> 33:34.845
Oh, I thought you
wanted me to let him go.

33:35.072 --> 33:36.254
-(struggling)
-My bad.

33:36.406 --> 33:38.056
Let's-let's get him back.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.909
(defibrillator humming)

33:40.927 --> 33:42.269
Hmm.

33:43.022 --> 33:44.763
-(grunts)
-HEN: Chimney.

33:44.857 --> 33:47.916
(sobbing):
Come on, Chimney.

33:47.934 --> 33:49.967
-I've got nothing.
-(cries out)

33:50.120 --> 33:52.604
-Let's give it a go again.
-(sobbing)

33:52.698 --> 33:54.439
Clear.

33:54.533 --> 33:55.699
(Hen exclaims)

33:55.850 --> 33:56.849
Chimney.

33:56.943 --> 33:58.777
(Hen sobbing)

33:58.929 --> 33:59.944
(Jonah sighs)

34:00.097 --> 34:01.946
(monitor beeping)

34:02.041 --> 34:03.373
(Jonah chuckles)

34:03.600 --> 34:06.626
I really don't know
what you see in this guy.

34:10.532 --> 34:11.715
(groans)

34:11.866 --> 34:13.533
You need a partner

34:13.552 --> 34:14.943
who's more your speed.

34:15.036 --> 34:16.678
(Jonah sighs)

34:24.730 --> 34:26.045
You...

34:26.065 --> 34:30.358
You really think
you're my speed?

34:31.461 --> 34:33.070
You're sloppy.

34:33.297 --> 34:34.796
I'm not sloppy, don't say that.

34:34.889 --> 34:36.907
HEN:
Even if I wanted to do

34:37.134 --> 34:38.724
some of the horrible things,

34:38.744 --> 34:40.744
horrible things that you did,

34:40.895 --> 34:41.820
you really think

34:41.914 --> 34:44.397
I would have
let myself get caught?

34:44.491 --> 34:45.582
(scoffs)

34:47.086 --> 34:48.310
You killed people.

34:48.328 --> 34:49.311
It wasn't on purpose.

34:49.404 --> 34:51.663
They weren't supposed to die.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.423
I was gonna save 'em.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.836
I'm a hero.

34:57.930 --> 35:00.171
You might have been.

35:00.324 --> 35:02.766
Once, when you were a child.

35:02.917 --> 35:05.936
But not now.

35:06.087 --> 35:07.162
All you are

35:07.255 --> 35:09.439
is a murderer now!

35:09.666 --> 35:10.682
(struggling)

35:10.834 --> 35:12.776
No, I'm not.

35:12.927 --> 35:16.855
Then why is Chimney
not breathing?

35:16.949 --> 35:20.492
(monitor beeping rapidly)

35:24.456 --> 35:26.039
(Chimney grunts)

35:26.683 --> 35:29.200
(Hen gasping)

35:29.294 --> 35:30.776
(groaning)

35:30.796 --> 35:32.354
Chim.

35:32.372 --> 35:34.280
-Easy, easy, easy.
-(groaning)

35:34.299 --> 35:37.300
Easy, Chim,
easy, easy, easy, easy, easy...

35:37.452 --> 35:38.877
(Chimney sighs)

35:38.971 --> 35:40.494
Easy, Chim, easy.

35:40.547 --> 35:43.031
Easy, take it easy.

35:43.049 --> 35:45.383
(grunting)

35:45.535 --> 35:46.868
(panting)

35:46.887 --> 35:47.978
(stammering):
Careful, Chim.

35:48.129 --> 35:50.221
Careful... (exclaims)

35:50.374 --> 35:52.040
-Are you okay?
-CHIMNEY: Not even...

35:52.133 --> 35:53.725
(groaning)

35:53.877 --> 35:56.561
Okay, come on, buddy, come on.

35:56.713 --> 35:57.988
-(groaning)
-Okay.

35:58.139 --> 35:59.805
All right, buddy.

35:59.825 --> 36:03.401
Good idea
with the defibrillator.

36:03.553 --> 36:05.311
You saved us.

36:05.405 --> 36:07.889
It was...

36:07.908 --> 36:09.666
a team effort.

36:09.893 --> 36:12.961
(Hen sobbing)

36:18.343 --> 36:20.418
-(sirens wailing)
-RAVI: Lucy.

36:20.570 --> 36:23.071
They're saying
it was Hen and Chimney,

36:23.089 --> 36:24.014
a-and they were attacked.

36:24.165 --> 36:26.558
What? By who?

36:28.428 --> 36:30.187
-ATHENA: Slow down, slow down.
-BOBBY: We need to get in there.

36:30.414 --> 36:31.763
-We need to get in there.
-This is a crime scene.

36:31.915 --> 36:34.349
-Hey, Cap.
-LUCY: Wait, Cap!

36:35.343 --> 36:37.009
-Bobby.
-BOBBY: You son of a bitch,

36:37.029 --> 36:38.937
-I trusted you.
-(grunts)

36:39.089 --> 36:40.697
(overlapping chatter)

36:40.848 --> 36:44.926
Enough. He's not worth
any more of your time.

36:45.019 --> 36:46.611
Nice punch.

36:46.763 --> 36:47.946
Thank God you guys are alive.

36:48.098 --> 36:49.614
I am so sorry about
what happened to you.

36:49.691 --> 36:51.857
I'm just glad he got caught,

36:52.068 --> 36:53.284
and in the act.

36:53.361 --> 36:56.454
Hopefully this evidence
will be more concrete

36:56.606 --> 36:57.956
than what we were
working with earlier.

36:58.050 --> 36:59.457
ATHENA:
With this evidence,

36:59.609 --> 37:01.943
that man will be going away
for the rest of his life.

37:02.036 --> 37:04.370
He won't ever hurt anybody
ever again.

37:04.389 --> 37:07.140
CHIMNEY:
Then it was worth it.

37:08.560 --> 37:12.062
How were you guys able to get
the police here so fast?

37:12.213 --> 37:13.638
I thought we were
out here on our own.

37:13.790 --> 37:17.734
Karen called,
told us everything she knew.

37:17.961 --> 37:21.980
You know, you're a lucky woman
to have a wife like that.

37:22.074 --> 37:24.148
Don't I know it.

37:24.243 --> 37:25.909
We're gonna contact
Karen and Maddie,

37:26.060 --> 37:27.244
let 'em know what hospital
they're taking you to,

37:27.395 --> 37:29.061
and we'll be right behind you.

37:29.155 --> 37:31.414
We're good, Cap.

37:31.566 --> 37:33.416
I got him.

37:42.319 --> 37:44.577
-Hey, uh... are you okay?
-Yeah, we're fine.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.504
They cleared the apartment,
they took my statement,

37:46.656 --> 37:48.098
they're gonna leave a few guys
behind for the night.

37:48.325 --> 37:49.841
But... isn't Jonah in custody?

37:49.917 --> 37:51.676
They were worried about
press showing up or something.

37:51.828 --> 37:53.252
Anyway, I really need to
get to the hospital and just

37:53.346 --> 37:54.920
-make sure that he's okay.
-Yeah.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.498
I mean, it seems like he's okay.

37:56.591 --> 37:58.516
You know, making jokes
and being Chimney, but...

37:58.668 --> 37:59.925
Are you okay with her
for a few hours?

37:59.945 --> 38:01.519
Yeah.
Come on, me and Jee will have

38:01.613 --> 38:03.780
-a little slumber party.
-(Jee-Yun babbles)

38:03.931 --> 38:05.740
Is that him?

38:07.177 --> 38:08.434
Uh, well...

38:08.512 --> 38:11.195
-Turn the volume up?
-Yeah.

38:11.348 --> 38:14.365
<i> Sources close to the case say</i>
<i> Firefighter/Paramedic Greenway</i>

38:14.518 --> 38:16.459

Taylor. What did you do?

I don't think I need to tell you
how lucky you are.

38:39.042 --> 38:41.709
No, but I'd love to hear
that I'm okay

38:41.728 --> 38:43.302
and that you're sending me home.

38:43.396 --> 38:44.637
Your heart stopped and you were

38:44.656 --> 38:45.989
shocked back to life-- twice.

38:46.216 --> 38:48.825
We're keeping you overnight
for observation, Mr. Han.

38:49.052 --> 38:51.477
Doc, I feel okay, really.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.312
Great. But,

38:53.332 --> 38:55.223
to make sure you stay that way,
we got to make sure

38:55.241 --> 38:56.908
you don't have arrhythmias
or any other permanent damage.

38:57.060 --> 38:59.060
You'll spend the night
on the cardiac floor,

38:59.153 --> 39:00.562
then we'll send you home
with a Holter monitor

39:00.580 --> 39:02.154
for a couple days.

39:02.232 --> 39:05.083
Awesome. Can't wait.

39:05.159 --> 39:06.992
HEN:
Chim, she's right.

39:07.012 --> 39:10.013
You can never be too safe.

39:10.164 --> 39:12.090
Especially after
what he did to you.

39:12.242 --> 39:13.999
DR. SALAZAR:
I'm glad you feel that way,

39:14.094 --> 39:15.076
'cause we're keeping you, too.

39:15.095 --> 39:17.336
Why?
My heart is fine.

39:17.430 --> 39:18.688
We need to do a full workup
and a tox screen,

39:18.840 --> 39:20.248
make sure he didn't inject you

39:20.266 --> 39:21.674
with anything else
besides propofol.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.084
The nurse should be here soon.

39:23.177 --> 39:25.511
(sighs)
Got to say,

39:25.530 --> 39:28.990
I didn't see our victory lap
going down like this.

39:29.943 --> 39:31.350
KAREN:
Oh, my God.

39:31.370 --> 39:32.427
Hen.

39:32.445 --> 39:35.896
Ooh, hey, I'm fine, I'm fine.

39:35.949 --> 39:37.165
Are you sure?

39:38.101 --> 39:39.692
What did he do to you?

39:39.861 --> 39:41.694
I'm okay.

39:41.863 --> 39:43.938
Chimney took the brunt of it.

39:43.957 --> 39:45.273
KAREN:
Oh, God,

39:45.291 --> 39:48.109
-Chim.
-I'm fine, we're both fine.

39:48.169 --> 39:49.702
Doc said
we're both gonna be okay.

39:49.796 --> 39:52.405
KAREN:
God, the whole way over here,
I just...

39:52.465 --> 39:54.282
I was mentally preparing myself

39:54.300 --> 39:56.041
for the worst-case scenario.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.711
(voice quavering):
I didn't know where you were,

39:58.730 --> 40:00.397
or if you'd even
make it out alive.

40:00.582 --> 40:03.291
What would I tell Denny?
Your mother?

40:03.309 --> 40:04.901
-It's okay.
-(Karen shudders)

40:05.070 --> 40:06.736
Everything's fine.

40:06.888 --> 40:08.696
(sighs)

40:09.799 --> 40:12.492
He can never hurt
anybody again.

40:18.232 --> 40:19.899
(Athena sighs deeply)

40:19.918 --> 40:21.066
Should I get you

40:21.086 --> 40:22.234
a steak, too?
(chuckles)

40:22.254 --> 40:25.255
Is that just for black eyes?

40:25.482 --> 40:28.425
Ice will be just fine,
thank you.

40:29.261 --> 40:30.835
You know,
I'm not sure I've ever

40:30.987 --> 40:32.929
seen you snap like that.

40:33.080 --> 40:34.597
Well, you don't remember.

40:34.674 --> 40:36.933
When you were attacked
at the storage unit?

40:37.084 --> 40:38.935
(Athena sighs)

40:39.162 --> 40:41.438
I thought about doing something
that night.

40:41.589 --> 40:43.998
Then I saw you and realized
you needed me more.

40:44.017 --> 40:45.850
(chuckles)
Mm.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.444
My hero.

40:47.595 --> 40:49.446
Hitting Jonah, probably not
the most heroic of actions.

40:49.639 --> 40:52.282
I certainly let my emotions
get the better of me.

40:52.433 --> 40:54.099
-Oh?
-Just couldn't help myself.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.953
Yeah, well, it's hard
seeing the people you love

40:57.104 --> 40:58.846
hurting like that.

40:58.940 --> 41:02.292
Especially when you feel
responsible for it.

41:03.128 --> 41:06.020
I let that man into my house.

41:06.039 --> 41:08.280
This isn't your fault.

41:08.300 --> 41:11.050
I let that man into my house.

41:18.051 --> 41:21.978
(indistinct P.A. announcement)

41:23.206 --> 41:24.147
(whispering):
Hey.

41:24.298 --> 41:26.733
I'm breaking out of this joint.

41:27.802 --> 41:28.876
Are you with me?

41:28.970 --> 41:30.561
I'm all in, ride or die.

41:30.655 --> 41:34.365
Just unhook me and
help me find my pants.

41:36.553 --> 41:37.660
What?

41:40.223 --> 41:41.998
You almost did die.

41:43.226 --> 41:45.502
I'm sorry for roping you
into all of this, Chim.

41:45.729 --> 41:49.154
The only reason he went
after you is because of me.

41:49.249 --> 41:52.175
I wish I had never
gotten you involved.

41:52.344 --> 41:55.828
Come on, now,
that's not how we do it.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.496
You jump, I jump.

41:57.590 --> 41:59.741
Or something like that.

41:59.759 --> 42:01.518
Think I was gonna let you go
after that creep by yourself?

42:01.594 --> 42:04.837
I knew you'd have my back
and there'd be no stopping you.

42:04.931 --> 42:06.189
Exactly.

42:06.340 --> 42:08.599
So what are we even
talking about here?

42:08.752 --> 42:11.102
You know, I never liked him.

42:11.254 --> 42:12.587
Jonah, I mean.

42:12.605 --> 42:14.438
Not much of a fan myself.

42:14.591 --> 42:15.347
(slurps)

42:15.367 --> 42:17.308
Everyone thought I was crazy,

42:17.460 --> 42:19.852
that I was being
too hard on him

42:19.871 --> 42:22.413
because he wasn't you.
But you...

42:23.190 --> 42:26.042
...you never flinched.

42:26.269 --> 42:28.770
You were on board
from the start,

42:28.863 --> 42:31.381
ready to go to battle
with me, even...

42:31.608 --> 42:36.094
even when I had no proof,
no idea if I was even right.

42:36.963 --> 42:38.471
You're always right.

42:39.299 --> 42:40.631
That's kind of our schtick.

42:40.708 --> 42:42.892
You're the genius,
I'm the comic relief.

42:43.044 --> 42:44.969
(slurps)

42:45.121 --> 42:48.064
You're so much more than that.

42:49.459 --> 42:51.142
(voice breaking):
You're the best friend

42:51.236 --> 42:53.552
that I've ever had, Chim.

42:54.631 --> 42:57.699
And I can't imagine my life
without you.

42:58.635 --> 43:00.034
(sets juice pack down)

43:04.749 --> 43:07.750
And you're never gonna have to.
