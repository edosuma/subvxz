00:29.268 --> 00:30.561
Bring her in.

00:36.026 --> 00:37.691
- Is this the girl?
- Amanda Peterson.

00:37.693 --> 00:39.735
- Why is her face covered?
- No!

00:39.737 --> 00:41.489
Her eyes are sensitive to light.

00:42.825 --> 00:43.867
Even at night?

00:47.328 --> 00:48.578
Has her father been found?

00:48.580 --> 00:49.913
No, not yet.

00:49.915 --> 00:52.082
We expanded our search
without any leads.

00:52.084 --> 00:53.917
It's impossible to
know where he is.

00:53.919 --> 00:55.377
Can you save her?

00:55.379 --> 00:57.212
We will do what we can.

00:57.214 --> 00:59.757
The Lord is powerful
within these walls.

01:07.683 --> 01:08.517
Sister?

01:23.031 --> 01:24.948
Take Amanda to the third floor.

01:24.950 --> 01:26.743
Keep her away from
the other children

01:27.953 --> 01:32.330
and make sure her
door remains locked.

01:32.332 --> 01:33.541
Yes, Father.

01:36.962 --> 01:38.671
Have faith in
the Lord, my child.

02:22.006 --> 02:23.508
Oh, I'm so sorry.

02:27.054 --> 02:28.263
Do you wanna play a game?

02:30.306 --> 02:32.432
It's much too late for that.

02:32.434 --> 02:33.352
It's time for bed.

02:34.644 --> 02:36.437
Daddy didn't
wanna play either.

02:38.524 --> 02:40.397
What happened to your father?

02:40.399 --> 02:43.151
We wanna
play hide and seek.

02:43.153 --> 02:44.444
We?

02:44.446 --> 02:46.907
Yes, me and my friend.

02:49.159 --> 02:50.202
Who is your friend?

03:13.767 --> 03:14.601
Amanda?

03:26.029 --> 03:26.864
Amanda?

03:37.249 --> 03:38.083
Amanda?

03:51.262 --> 03:52.597
He doesn't like the light.

03:54.725 --> 03:55.559
Amanda.

03:58.436 --> 03:59.270
Amanda?

04:10.114 --> 04:10.948
Amanda?

04:13.452 --> 04:22.125
Amanda?

04:22.127 --> 04:22.961
Amanda?

04:49.113 --> 04:49.947
Amanda?

05:18.683 --> 05:20.892
- Now we're recording.
- Good.

05:20.894 --> 05:24.186
This is Father Wes from
St Petersburg Orphanage.

05:24.188 --> 05:28.483
The date is June 6th,
1966 at the time of 7 p.m.

05:28.485 --> 05:33.363
I've asked Father Thomas to
assist me with Amanda Peterson,

05:33.365 --> 05:38.827
who has properly secured and
is being lit by candlelight.

05:38.829 --> 05:40.581
Do you know why
you're here, Amanda?

05:42.457 --> 05:44.917
I need you to answer
yes or no, Amanda.

05:46.712 --> 05:50.089
- Yes.
- Why are you here, Amanda?

05:51.632 --> 05:54.508
You're trying
to take my friend away.

05:54.510 --> 05:56.220
And
who is your friend?

05:57.598 --> 05:59.847
Daddy didn't
play by the rules.

05:59.849 --> 06:01.767
What rules, Amanda?

06:01.769 --> 06:03.685
You have
to play in the dark.

06:03.687 --> 06:05.854
He doesn't like the light.

06:05.856 --> 06:08.399
It hurts him just like me.

06:11.361 --> 06:12.445
We're the same.

06:26.752 --> 06:27.584
Beer?

06:27.586 --> 06:28.751
I've got one.

06:28.753 --> 06:31.712
- Oh, okay.
- Look who it is.

06:31.714 --> 06:33.423
- Hey, sis.
- Hi!

06:33.425 --> 06:34.590
What's goin' on?

06:34.592 --> 06:36.217
- You brought Becca.
- Yeah.

06:36.219 --> 06:38.594
Finally convinced her
come along with us, tonight.

06:38.596 --> 06:40.722
Of course, the
more the merrier.

06:40.724 --> 06:41.765
- What's up, Todd?
- How're you doin'?

06:41.767 --> 06:43.849
- Good to see you.
- Welcome.

06:43.851 --> 06:44.683
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:44.685 --> 06:45.560
Good to see you.

06:45.562 --> 06:47.686
Where are Adam and Shane?

06:47.688 --> 06:50.815
They said they'd
be runnin' late.

06:50.817 --> 06:52.567
Surprise, surprise.

06:52.569 --> 06:54.443
Well let's get started.

06:54.445 --> 06:59.284
I have a new location that
will make up for the last one.

07:04.580 --> 07:06.330
Ooh no way, we
made an orphanage?

07:06.332 --> 07:07.873
Yeah, this place looks huge.

07:07.875 --> 07:09.166
It is.

07:09.168 --> 07:11.878
It's got three stories,
it has a worship area,

07:11.880 --> 07:13.171
a cellar, a courtyard.

07:13.173 --> 07:14.339
Security?

07:14.341 --> 07:16.590
Yes, every two hours.

07:16.592 --> 07:19.010
This place is so big and
our time is so limited,

07:19.012 --> 07:21.512
we're gonna have to split
up to cover the most area.

07:21.514 --> 07:23.765
Why was it abandoned?

07:23.767 --> 07:25.933
I'm not really sure why.

07:25.935 --> 07:28.979
I came up mostly
empty-handed in my research.

07:28.981 --> 07:31.606
The building's been abandoned
for nearly 50 years.

07:31.608 --> 07:34.109
Sometime in the late 60s,

07:34.111 --> 07:36.570
there was a commotion
about the orphanage.

07:36.572 --> 07:38.238
It was rumored that employees

07:38.240 --> 07:39.783
and children were going missing.

07:41.243 --> 07:43.493
Eventually the church
stepped in and shut it down

07:43.495 --> 07:46.036
and no one has been in it since.

07:50.252 --> 07:51.084
Where's our big shout out?

07:51.086 --> 07:51.918
You're late.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.044
Hello.

07:53.046 --> 07:54.378
Muah, thank you.

07:54.380 --> 07:55.796
- We brought stuff.
- Well that's good.

07:55.798 --> 07:57.173
What'd we miss?

07:57.175 --> 07:59.592
Well, Kate was telling us
about the abandoned orphanage.

07:59.594 --> 08:02.803
Ooh, oldie but a goodie.

08:02.805 --> 08:04.263
- You know it?
- Of course.

08:04.265 --> 08:05.556
Thank you.

08:05.558 --> 08:06.849
My mom used to try
to use that shit on me

08:06.851 --> 08:09.019
and scare me when
I was a little kid.

08:09.021 --> 08:10.856
We could see what a
wonderful job it did.

08:13.649 --> 08:16.943
Why are we talkin' about it?

08:16.945 --> 08:19.654
Katie's officially made it
our next urban explorer site.

08:19.656 --> 08:20.490
All right.

08:22.493 --> 08:24.118
To the urban explorers.

08:25.411 --> 08:27.996
What society has left behind.

08:27.998 --> 08:30.832
- Discarded.
- Forgotten.

08:30.834 --> 08:32.750
Allowed for
nature to take back

08:32.751 --> 08:35.712
and left for us to explore!

08:38.717 --> 08:40.217
All right, eat up, we got to
get our eight hours tonight.

08:40.219 --> 08:43.260
Guys before we break
off and eat and all that,

08:43.261 --> 08:45.639
I wanna say something
'cause you're all here

08:45.641 --> 08:47.223
and you're all like my family,

08:47.225 --> 08:52.813
so I can't think of a
better time to do this.

08:52.815 --> 08:54.396
I know it's only
been six months,

08:54.398 --> 08:58.025
but I feel like I've
known you forever.

08:58.027 --> 08:59.693
I loved you since the
first moment I saw you

08:59.695 --> 09:01.696
and I can't imagine
another day in my life

09:01.698 --> 09:02.825
without you as my partner.

09:04.743 --> 09:05.576
Becca,

09:08.329 --> 09:10.831
will you go on the
adventure with me?

09:10.833 --> 09:11.832
Yes.

09:13.627 --> 09:16.962
- Oh yeah!
- Put it in her!

09:16.964 --> 09:18.170
Okay we need a picture,
we need a picture.

09:18.172 --> 09:20.048
Okay we need a
picture of these now.

09:20.050 --> 09:21.674
- Why?
- Really?

09:21.676 --> 09:23.843
Do you guys seriously need
to remember this moment

09:23.845 --> 09:25.220
- for the rest of your lives?
- Yes, we do.

09:25.222 --> 09:27.472
- Picture time.
- Immortalize it in a photo.

09:27.474 --> 09:29.307
All right, all right.

09:29.309 --> 09:30.144
Okay.

09:33.021 --> 09:33.856
Okay, everyone.

09:35.523 --> 09:36.357
- Ready?
- Ready.

09:39.902 --> 09:40.861
Say cheese.

09:40.863 --> 09:44.905
Cheese!

09:44.907 --> 09:45.823
Hey Kate, we're all set up.

09:45.825 --> 09:49.410
Let's go.

09:49.412 --> 09:50.662
What's wrong?

09:50.664 --> 09:51.498
Nothing.

09:55.835 --> 09:57.877
Okay,

09:57.879 --> 09:59.587
I'm not stupid.

09:59.589 --> 10:03.048
I know that look you get when
something's bothering you.

10:03.050 --> 10:03.886
What is it?

10:06.763 --> 10:08.639
Ooh, I get it.

10:10.057 --> 10:10.892
Get what?

10:12.393 --> 10:14.897
I saw how you reacted
when Todd proposed to Becca.

10:16.105 --> 10:18.356
Do you not like Becca?

10:18.358 --> 10:19.857
No, of course I do.

10:19.859 --> 10:22.861
It's just that was
the very first time

10:22.863 --> 10:25.905
I've ever heard my
brother mention marriage

10:25.907 --> 10:29.076
and we tell each
other everything.

10:29.078 --> 10:32.956
So to hear it the first time
with all of you felt shocking,

10:34.666 --> 10:35.707
like he didn't want his sister

10:35.709 --> 10:37.958
to be a part of that decision.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.671
Like what else is
he not telling me?

10:40.964 --> 10:43.631
Okay, you're way
overthinking it.

10:43.633 --> 10:44.924
He's your brother.

10:44.926 --> 10:46.844
He's not just gonna cut
you out of his life.

10:49.388 --> 10:50.224
It'll be good.

10:51.432 --> 10:52.973
Now put on a smile
and let's go check out

10:52.975 --> 10:55.268
this amazing location
you found for us tonight.

10:55.270 --> 10:56.688
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

12:34.494 --> 12:37.621
Guys, let's take a
picture before we head in.

12:43.127 --> 12:43.961
Ready?

12:47.257 --> 12:49.507
Okay, I'm coming.

12:49.509 --> 12:50.384
Say cheese.

13:00.020 --> 13:02.187
Thanks.

13:02.189 --> 13:05.689
Okay you guys, side entrance
is right over there.

13:05.691 --> 13:06.526
Let's go.

13:41.728 --> 13:44.353
Oh Gods, it's
not that serious.

13:44.355 --> 13:45.646
Speak for yourself.

13:45.648 --> 13:47.150
Hey Ryan, help
me out with this.

14:04.251 --> 14:05.583
Becca.

14:05.585 --> 14:07.043
- Hey, Becca.
- Hey, Becca.

14:07.045 --> 14:08.837
First exploration?

14:08.839 --> 14:11.047
Hey, who's got
the walkie talkies?

14:11.049 --> 14:14.760
Oh no, I knew I
forgot something.

14:14.762 --> 14:16.343
You didn't.

14:16.345 --> 14:17.596
I am sorry, guys.

14:17.598 --> 14:18.599
Honest mistake.

14:19.682 --> 14:20.975
It's a safety precaution.

14:23.145 --> 14:25.481
Well, safety's for losers.

14:27.440 --> 14:31.152
Well, I mean...

14:33.613 --> 14:36.407
Calm your tits, we brought them.

14:38.618 --> 14:39.534
What's the matter?

14:39.536 --> 14:40.452
Scared you're gonna get lost?

14:40.454 --> 14:42.037
No, this place is huge.

14:42.039 --> 14:44.246
We can't be wanderin'
around without them.

14:44.248 --> 14:47.208
Maybe that's God's way
of thinning out the herd.

14:47.210 --> 14:49.627
Survival of the fittest.

14:49.629 --> 14:51.670
I'm sure you two would
be the first to go.

14:51.672 --> 14:55.174
Okay okay, I see
how it is.

14:55.176 --> 14:58.053
Check these, check these.

14:58.055 --> 14:59.261
It's got to be more
of a deep bend.

14:59.263 --> 15:01.264
- Deep and...
- Bend.

15:01.266 --> 15:02.223
That's functional.

15:02.225 --> 15:03.933
Completely functional strength.

15:03.935 --> 15:06.186
- There we go.
- There it is, got it.

15:06.188 --> 15:08.105
You guys are pretty gay.

15:08.107 --> 15:10.649
Haven't you ever
heard of a bromance?

15:10.651 --> 15:12.483
Yeah, who's the bigger spoon?

15:12.485 --> 15:14.151
Me.

15:14.153 --> 15:15.278
- Dude.
- Right?

15:15.280 --> 15:17.697
- Not this week.
- Oh that L.

15:17.699 --> 15:19.156
- Yeah.
- All right all right, lovebirds

15:19.158 --> 15:21.494
you're very cute but
ready to get goin'?

15:22.454 --> 15:25.621
I got hour 50.

15:25.623 --> 15:29.708
Get ready to synchronize
in three, two, one.

15:33.965 --> 15:35.298
All right.

15:35.300 --> 15:37.007
All right, that door
there goes upstairs.

15:37.009 --> 15:38.177
Becca and I'll take that.

15:39.805 --> 15:40.638
Okay.

15:42.682 --> 15:45.100
That goes to the kitchen.

15:45.102 --> 15:48.727
We'll take that
'cause I'm starving.

15:48.729 --> 15:51.188
Eww, there can't be
anything good in there.

15:51.190 --> 15:53.107
Be better than your cookin'.

15:53.109 --> 15:54.735
- Ooh, snap!
- Ooh!

15:55.903 --> 15:57.946
Yup, you're not
havin' dinner tonight.

15:57.948 --> 16:01.198
Well I guess that
leaves us with this way.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.284
Love you.

16:02.286 --> 16:03.492
Love you, miss you.

16:03.494 --> 16:12.001
- Keep an eye on them?
- Hurray for us.

16:12.003 --> 16:13.919
You wanna check
out the offices?

16:13.921 --> 16:14.757
Sure.

16:25.475 --> 16:27.641
- Booyah, first place.
- Ooh, second place.

16:27.643 --> 16:28.851
Sober and still good.

16:28.853 --> 16:30.395
♪ Yeah ♪

16:30.397 --> 16:33.148
This in third, this
in fourth; you lose.

16:33.150 --> 16:33.983
Ooh losers.

16:38.238 --> 16:39.279
Oh damn, hey look Tiff.

16:39.281 --> 16:40.237
It's like your wet dream.

16:40.239 --> 16:42.616
You got all those lock stuff.

16:42.618 --> 16:43.493
Keys.

16:47.539 --> 16:49.206
Did you see that?

16:49.208 --> 16:51.502
- Something just ran across.
- What?

17:16.192 --> 17:18.901
Excuse sir, are
you checking in today?

17:18.903 --> 17:21.112
I can't feel
my legs.

17:21.114 --> 17:22.823
I would like
three cheeseburgers,

17:22.825 --> 17:23.989
- four...
- Guys.

17:23.991 --> 17:25.324
Seriously guys?

17:25.326 --> 17:28.369
This was an orphanage,
not a mental institution.

17:28.372 --> 17:29.371
What's the difference?

17:29.373 --> 17:30.746
Nothing, really, when
it comes to you two.

17:30.748 --> 17:32.416
- Ooh.
- Ooh, snap!

17:32.418 --> 17:35.001
Yo Ryan, you should keep a
tighter leash on your girl.

17:35.003 --> 17:36.753
Not his girl,
we're just friends.

17:36.755 --> 17:39.630
Yuh huh, like me and
Adam were just friends.

17:39.632 --> 17:43.384
Wait
a minute, what?

17:43.386 --> 17:45.637
Okay guys, let's keep going.

17:45.639 --> 17:48.183
- Come on.
- Okay, where do you wanna go?

17:50.017 --> 17:52.145
- To pound town?
- No, not to pound town.

17:56.107 --> 17:58.566
So just friends, huh?

17:58.568 --> 18:00.151
Can we not talk
about that now?

18:00.153 --> 18:02.405
I have a lot on my mind, I don't
need your voice in my head.

18:04.575 --> 18:09.828
Yeah, no worries.

18:09.830 --> 18:11.412
Hey, I'm sorry.

18:11.414 --> 18:12.747
I didn't mean it like that.

18:12.749 --> 18:14.876
No just like you said,
we can talk about it later.

18:15.878 --> 18:16.837
Hey check this out.

18:22.301 --> 18:24.633
Can you imagine wearing
an outfit like that?

18:24.635 --> 18:25.470
Not really.

18:44.448 --> 18:45.282
Wow.

18:47.325 --> 18:50.744
What?

18:50.746 --> 18:52.411
You know what
this reminds me of?

18:52.413 --> 18:53.746
What?

18:53.748 --> 18:55.623
That show where
they hunt ghosts.

18:55.625 --> 18:58.711
Oh yes, I have just the thing.

19:02.216 --> 19:06.258
- Oh yeah, perfect.
- Mmkay.

19:06.260 --> 19:07.930
- How do I look?
- Looking good.

19:10.516 --> 19:13.350
Tell our viewers at home
what we found, baby?

19:13.352 --> 19:14.559
Don't call me baby.

19:14.561 --> 19:16.311
Let's keep it
professional, Karen.

19:16.313 --> 19:19.355
Yes, Mr Baby.

19:19.357 --> 19:20.942
Mmm, that's more like it.

19:22.236 --> 19:23.402
Crikey, why are we here?

19:24.947 --> 19:28.114
Never seen one of these
in the wild before.

19:28.116 --> 19:29.490
I thought you said you
wanted to be like a guy

19:29.492 --> 19:32.119
who hunts ghosts, not
be Australian guy.

19:32.121 --> 19:33.370
You don't like my accent?

19:33.372 --> 19:34.329
Uh uh, I'm sorry.

19:34.331 --> 19:35.746
But here, lemme give it a try.

19:35.748 --> 19:38.499
All right, give it to me.

19:38.501 --> 19:41.210
Aww, look how cute she is.

19:41.212 --> 19:42.046
Thank you.

19:42.922 --> 19:44.464
Hi.

19:44.466 --> 19:46.341
All right, where are we?

19:46.343 --> 19:49.761
As you can clearly see,
we're now in the kitchen

19:49.763 --> 19:52.848
of the famed
abandoned orphanage.

19:52.850 --> 19:56.186
Yeah in the kitchen,
my favorite spot.

19:57.312 --> 19:58.352
What's it called?

19:58.354 --> 19:59.690
It's called...

20:01.607 --> 20:03.483
I actually don't know
the name of this place.

20:03.485 --> 20:04.400
What is it?

20:04.402 --> 20:05.986
I don't know what it's called,

20:05.988 --> 20:07.486
I thought you would
know the name.

20:10.784 --> 20:11.618
What was that?

20:15.998 --> 20:16.832
I don't know.

20:17.623 --> 20:18.915
But let's go check it out,

20:18.917 --> 20:35.806
- shall we?
- Yes.

20:35.808 --> 20:40.394
- Very romantic, Todd.
- Ooh yeah, well I try.

20:40.396 --> 20:42.064
Wanna check this one out?

20:46.402 --> 20:47.902
Oh God, no no no no no!

20:47.904 --> 20:56.870
Mmm, jeez.

20:56.872 --> 21:00.540
Hey, look at that.

21:11.969 --> 21:12.805
Come on.

21:25.359 --> 21:27.444
Babe, what am I supposed
to be looking for?

21:30.197 --> 21:31.696
It's not so much
about finding something.

21:31.698 --> 21:34.700
It's about exploring
what once was.

21:36.370 --> 21:37.953
Look at this place,
it used to be filled

21:37.955 --> 21:39.456
with little kids runnin' around.

21:41.165 --> 21:42.667
Now it's just totally forgotten.

21:46.087 --> 21:48.965
I can't tell if they left
in a hurry or looters came in.

21:50.383 --> 21:52.300
Could be both.

21:52.302 --> 21:53.552
In establishment this
big couldn't just pick up

21:53.554 --> 21:57.639
and leave in the
middle of the night.

21:57.641 --> 21:58.475
Could they?

22:00.227 --> 22:01.560
I don't know.

22:01.562 --> 22:02.561
You'd be surprised at how
fast people could move

22:02.563 --> 22:04.773
with the right motivation.

22:08.776 --> 22:11.277
Should we move on?

22:11.279 --> 22:12.113
Yeah, sure.

22:23.584 --> 22:25.667
Hey hey, Becca.

22:25.669 --> 22:27.252
Wanna check this one?

22:27.254 --> 22:28.088
Door is locked.

22:29.590 --> 22:31.214
Grab my crowbar.

22:31.216 --> 22:32.050
It's back here.

22:34.635 --> 22:37.221
The big pouch.

22:41.642 --> 22:42.478
All right.

22:43.644 --> 22:45.354
Looks like they don't
want anyone gettin' in.

22:46.148 --> 22:47.229
Or getting out.

23:09.712 --> 23:11.545
- I'm just saying that...
- Yo.

23:11.547 --> 23:14.882
- If you haven't tried this...
- Oh, look outside.

23:14.884 --> 23:15.717
Look at that.

23:15.719 --> 23:17.928
Oh, there's no window.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.303
- Cool.
- Damn,

23:19.305 --> 23:21.182
- is this a lime tree?
- Citrus fruits.

23:22.517 --> 23:24.184
- Wow.
- It's a lime.

23:24.186 --> 23:26.686
I bet this place was
beautiful back in the day.

23:26.688 --> 23:27.646
Yeah.

23:27.648 --> 23:28.854
- Move, I need a pee.
- Yeah, me too.

23:28.856 --> 23:30.566
- Do you wanna cross swords?
- Okay.

23:31.943 --> 23:33.192
Wait, hang on.

23:33.194 --> 23:34.028
- There you go.
- There's no moon.

23:34.822 --> 23:36.112
Right?

23:37.282 --> 23:41.200
- Oh, right I...
- Eww, gross.

23:41.202 --> 23:42.619
Guys, show some respect.

23:42.621 --> 23:43.870
What?

23:43.872 --> 23:45.162
I thought you ladies
might wanna take a peek.

23:45.164 --> 23:46.747
Well did you bring
the magnifying glass?

23:48.669 --> 23:52.294
Ooh, I thought I was done.

23:52.296 --> 23:53.214
Do you hear that?

23:54.967 --> 23:56.468
Could have been a raccoon.

23:57.885 --> 23:59.178
Did you guys hear that?

24:00.389 --> 24:01.223
Guys?

24:20.700 --> 24:21.992
What'd you find?

24:21.994 --> 24:23.454
This cabinet, it
says private on it.

24:26.748 --> 24:28.790
- Yeah.
- Ooh.

24:28.792 --> 24:31.418
Oh, man.

24:31.420 --> 24:32.254
Here.

24:35.298 --> 24:37.550
Tapes, journals, docs.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.388
Here, what's in here?

24:48.603 --> 24:49.852
Oh my God, these
are the people

24:49.854 --> 24:51.440
who went missing
from the orphanage.

24:52.690 --> 24:53.525
Look at this.

24:54.692 --> 24:55.734
That kid was messed up.

24:55.736 --> 25:03.492
No wonder they locked
that in the drawer.

25:03.494 --> 25:06.538
Yikes, they used to
perform exorcisms here.

25:08.248 --> 25:09.458
Let's check this out.

25:11.876 --> 25:14.252
"Property of Father
Thomas."

25:14.254 --> 25:15.255
Let's see.

25:17.716 --> 25:19.885
"August 10th, 1966.

25:21.135 --> 25:23.719
"Do not fear what you
are about to suffer.

25:23.721 --> 25:27.265
"Behold, the Devil is about to
cast some of you into prison

25:27.267 --> 25:28.725
"so that you will be tested

25:28.727 --> 25:31.727
"and you will have
tribulation for 10 days.

25:31.729 --> 25:33.438
"Be faithful until death

25:33.440 --> 25:35.732
"and I will give you
the crown of life.

25:35.734 --> 25:37.151
"Revelations 2:10.

25:38.319 --> 25:39.945
"Even with these
words to hold close,

25:39.947 --> 25:41.822
"I am truly being tested.

25:41.824 --> 25:43.657
"We've locked Amanda
up in her chambers,

25:43.659 --> 25:44.949
"but she still manages to escape

25:44.951 --> 25:47.201
"and run around the
halls at night.

25:47.203 --> 25:48.871
"Every night we lose someone.

25:50.790 --> 25:53.291
"The church refuses
to send help.

25:53.293 --> 25:55.794
"Where is the light
in all this darkness?"

25:55.796 --> 25:56.919
He's tryin' to...

26:01.427 --> 26:03.178
Let's go check it out.

26:12.854 --> 26:13.689
Adam?

26:15.857 --> 26:16.774
Shane?

26:31.873 --> 26:40.088
It's like a
freezer or something.

26:42.633 --> 26:43.550
What was that?

26:43.552 --> 26:46.511
That scared the hell outta me.

26:46.513 --> 26:47.347
Holy shit!

26:50.183 --> 26:52.809
What, what is it?

26:52.811 --> 26:55.647
There was somebody behind you.

27:02.738 --> 27:03.778
No there isn't.

27:03.780 --> 27:04.946
I swear to God
there was somebody

27:04.948 --> 27:06.782
standing right behind you.

27:06.784 --> 27:07.823
Are you trying to scare me?

27:07.825 --> 27:10.619
I'm not lying, there
was something there.

27:10.621 --> 27:11.622
Lemme see.

27:14.333 --> 27:15.542
- Guys.
- Jeez.

27:16.959 --> 27:17.876
- What's up?
- We need you guys

27:17.878 --> 27:19.460
to come to the third floor.

27:19.462 --> 27:20.961
We'll be right there.

27:20.963 --> 27:21.798
Save the battery.

27:47.574 --> 27:52.579
I don't think we
should be in here.

28:03.590 --> 28:06.800
Soon as I closed the door,

28:06.802 --> 28:08.634
it was like right in
front of you right there

28:08.636 --> 28:09.844
- I thought.
- You're tryin' to scare me.

28:09.846 --> 28:10.847
I swear...

28:11.931 --> 28:13.890
- Wait.
- Oh God, what?

28:13.892 --> 28:16.309
- What was that?
- What was what?

28:16.311 --> 28:17.852
You didn't hear it?

28:17.854 --> 28:19.854
No, it probably
just the winds.

28:19.856 --> 28:20.815
Stop scaring me.

29:11.408 --> 29:12.242
Wow.

29:15.787 --> 29:17.912
Yeah this is cool, right?

29:17.914 --> 29:19.331
Did you guys find anything?

29:19.333 --> 29:20.916
Yeah, we found some
pretty cool stuff.

29:20.918 --> 29:22.417
We left it back at central.

29:22.419 --> 29:23.295
Except for this.

29:27.091 --> 29:27.925
Wow.

30:07.631 --> 30:10.131
You wanna play?

30:10.133 --> 30:11.632
Oh my God.

30:11.634 --> 30:14.093
How did you get in here?

30:14.095 --> 30:15.970
You shouldn't be in
a place like this.

30:15.972 --> 30:18.224
Your parents must be
worried sick about you.

30:24.021 --> 30:26.230
Hey,

30:26.232 --> 30:27.482
where'd you go?

30:27.484 --> 30:30.110
Do you wanna play a game?

30:30.112 --> 30:33.323
If you wanna play, you
have to turn off the light.

30:35.992 --> 30:37.784
I don't wanna play your game.

30:39.203 --> 30:40.495
Help.

30:40.497 --> 30:42.288
Help guys, help me please!

30:42.290 --> 30:43.622
Please!

30:43.624 --> 30:49.963
Babe, I'm gonna
check out this room.

30:49.965 --> 30:52.509
Hey Tiff, I bet you could
have picked those locks.

30:55.720 --> 30:56.846
Wait, where's Tiff?

30:59.098 --> 30:59.932
Tiff?

31:02.018 --> 31:03.893
Hey Tiff, come in.

31:03.895 --> 31:05.269
Hello, hello?

31:05.271 --> 31:06.438
Guys, can you hear me?

31:06.440 --> 31:07.274
Hello.

31:08.484 --> 31:10.694
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Tiff's missing.

31:11.987 --> 31:13.488
Have you tried her cell phone?

31:15.073 --> 31:16.365
I'm not gettin' any signal.

31:18.451 --> 31:19.577
- I'm not either.
- Me too.

31:20.953 --> 31:22.205
Hey Tiff, can you hear us?

31:23.248 --> 31:24.081
Please come in!

31:24.083 --> 31:25.209
Hello, I'm here please!

31:26.043 --> 31:27.833
Hello!

31:27.835 --> 31:28.668
Can you hear?

31:28.670 --> 31:29.505
Ugh!

31:31.256 --> 31:36.261
Okay.

31:54.153 --> 31:55.613
Hey Tiff, can you hear us?

31:56.989 --> 31:58.073
I'll go check on
the second floor.

31:58.075 --> 32:00.074
She was just right behind me.

32:00.076 --> 32:01.534
Okay hey you
guys, go with her.

32:01.536 --> 32:03.911
Find Tiff and just
come right back, okay?

32:03.913 --> 32:05.580
- Yes mother.
- Come on guys.

32:05.582 --> 32:07.123
Thank you, mother.

32:07.125 --> 32:09.043
Would you like us to
do the dishes too?

32:10.711 --> 32:15.717
Tiff?

32:16.552 --> 32:18.051
Hey, what's goin' on with Tiff?

32:18.053 --> 32:18.927
Nothin', she
just wandered off.

32:18.929 --> 32:20.094
They're lookin' for her.

32:20.096 --> 32:22.098
You guys, listen to this.

32:23.307 --> 32:26.309
March second 1966.

32:26.311 --> 32:28.730
Today we finally
received Amanda Peterson.

32:30.315 --> 32:31.150
Tiff?

32:34.569 --> 32:35.403
Tiff?

32:38.824 --> 32:42.117
The police reported to me
that her father went missing.

32:42.119 --> 32:45.078
They thought it best for
the girl to stay here.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.746
We shall make a home
for this poor girl

32:46.748 --> 32:49.916
and lead her to salvation.

32:49.918 --> 32:50.753
Tiff?

32:52.755 --> 32:53.589
Tiffany?

32:56.674 --> 32:59.176
May the Lord direct our
hearts towards the love

32:59.178 --> 33:02.094
of God and let us
help this poor child

33:02.096 --> 33:03.263
discover the light

33:03.265 --> 33:05.015
- within her heart.
- Tiffany?

33:05.017 --> 33:07.518
And become strong in
the eyes of the Lord.

33:18.363 --> 33:19.198
What's that?

33:34.546 --> 33:40.467
What, what is it?

33:40.469 --> 33:41.385
What is it?

33:42.805 --> 33:44.555
It's Tiff's
flashlight and walkie.

33:45.473 --> 33:47.932
You think she just ran off?

33:47.934 --> 33:49.602
She wouldn't
leave this behind.

33:58.528 --> 33:59.363
Tiff?

34:01.364 --> 34:02.199
Tiff?

34:05.244 --> 34:07.828
Guys?

34:09.915 --> 34:10.748
Guys?

34:17.214 --> 34:18.507
Guys, where are you?

34:24.429 --> 34:25.263
Guys.

34:32.603 --> 34:34.312
Screw you!

34:35.274 --> 34:37.274
Damn it, Jackie.

34:37.275 --> 34:39.067
You broke my light.

34:39.069 --> 34:40.571
That's what you get, assholes.

34:41.779 --> 34:43.654
Aw Jackie.

34:43.656 --> 34:45.281
Was it something I said?

34:45.283 --> 34:48.576
September first, 1966.

34:48.578 --> 34:53.123
the power of faith has once
again shown me the way: light.

34:53.125 --> 34:55.292
We installed the lights
and secured her room

34:55.293 --> 34:58.252
to prevent her from
hurting anyone else.

34:58.254 --> 35:00.339
There shall never be
darkness around her.

35:03.218 --> 35:04.219
What else does it say?

35:06.263 --> 35:07.471
The light shines
in the darkness

35:07.473 --> 35:09.973
and the darkness did
not comprehend it.

35:09.975 --> 35:12.975
I'm afraid even the darkness
can reach deep within.

35:12.977 --> 35:14.770
I can find no way
to stop the darkness

35:14.772 --> 35:16.315
that lurks within these halls.

35:17.274 --> 35:19.440
No one is safe.

35:19.442 --> 35:21.484
I have told everyone to leave.

35:21.486 --> 35:24.362
I locked myself in
to watch over Amanda.

35:24.364 --> 35:25.654
With God as my witness,

35:25.656 --> 35:27.283
I shall make sure
she doesn't escape.

35:29.828 --> 35:33.205
That's his last entry.

35:33.207 --> 35:34.040
Guys.

35:43.299 --> 35:45.343
Hey, I'll be right there.

35:46.303 --> 35:49.096
Katie.

35:49.098 --> 35:53.850
Hey Katie, what's up?

35:53.852 --> 35:56.355
I just can't imagine being
trapped in a room like this.

35:58.064 --> 35:59.023
Yeah.

36:00.484 --> 36:01.482
Did you find her?

36:01.484 --> 36:02.817
What's going on?

36:02.819 --> 36:03.694
Tiff is missing.

36:05.279 --> 36:07.364
But she left some of her
stuff in one of the rooms.

36:07.366 --> 36:09.408
That makes no sense.

36:09.410 --> 36:10.786
Where could she have gone?

36:12.328 --> 36:14.120
We don't know for sure
that she was trapped here.

36:14.122 --> 36:15.621
That's what the journal said.

36:15.623 --> 36:17.833
Yeah but you can't believe
everything you read, Katie.

36:17.835 --> 36:18.792
I bet she got outta
here and went on

36:18.794 --> 36:21.002
to live a full, happy life.

36:25.716 --> 36:29.386
Todd!

36:29.388 --> 36:30.386
Holy shit!

36:30.388 --> 36:32.471
Come on, let's go.

36:32.473 --> 36:33.307
Hey Guys!

36:35.685 --> 36:37.393
Kate?

36:37.395 --> 36:39.228
Hey, come on. Let us out!

36:39.230 --> 36:40.355
Ryan, get it open.

36:40.357 --> 36:41.772
- Whadya think I'm doin'?
- Hurry!

36:41.774 --> 36:43.732
- Seriously guys, open the door.
- Hey come on.

36:43.734 --> 36:46.361
You guys, hang on; let us out.

36:46.363 --> 36:48.446
- Hurry!
- You guys, hey.

36:48.448 --> 36:50.323
Open the door, guys.
Come on!

36:50.325 --> 36:51.658
Come on, put
your back into it.

36:51.660 --> 36:53.451
He's not helping.

36:53.453 --> 36:55.745
I'm sure they're
just joking with us.

36:55.747 --> 36:58.415
Does it look like
we're laughing?

36:58.417 --> 36:59.623
Come on, let's go.

36:59.625 --> 37:00.833
- You okay?
- What's goin' on?

37:00.835 --> 37:01.792
What the hell was that?

37:01.794 --> 37:02.627
What happened?

37:02.629 --> 37:03.795
You okay?

37:03.797 --> 37:05.379
There was a little
girl in there.

37:05.381 --> 37:07.047
She just showed up and
then the door slammed on us

37:07.049 --> 37:07.882
and she was gone.

37:07.884 --> 37:09.134
A little girl?

37:09.136 --> 37:10.801
She just vanished
out of thin air.

37:12.890 --> 37:14.431
Well done, guys.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.223
I mean I never took you
two to be pranksters,

37:16.225 --> 37:18.185
but you really had
these guys goin'.

37:18.187 --> 37:19.478
No, we're not
makin' this up, Adam.

37:19.480 --> 37:21.648
There was something
trapped in there with us.

37:27.654 --> 37:28.489
What was that?

37:31.325 --> 37:33.616
Maybe it was a little girl
that disappeared into the...

37:33.618 --> 37:36.453
Dude, shut up.

37:36.455 --> 37:37.745
If that's a little girl,

37:37.747 --> 37:39.330
why don't you two
go check it out.

37:39.332 --> 37:41.540
- Well...
- Go check it out.

37:41.542 --> 37:43.542
I would but...

37:43.544 --> 37:44.460
Yeah, okay.

37:44.462 --> 37:45.462
You know.

37:45.464 --> 37:46.462
- I twisted my...
- Adam come back.

37:48.424 --> 37:49.341
I'm sure it's nothing.

37:49.343 --> 37:50.174
Just scare him a little bit.

37:50.176 --> 37:51.967
Hello, anyone there?

37:51.969 --> 37:52.805
Tiff?

37:54.515 --> 37:56.973
See guys, there's
nothin' to worry about.

37:56.975 --> 37:58.266
There's nothing here.

38:00.645 --> 38:01.939
No, no, oh my God!

38:08.486 --> 38:12.614
Oh God, fuck!

38:25.212 --> 38:26.752
Help me, man!

38:33.636 --> 38:34.470
Shane stop!

38:38.183 --> 38:39.306
Shane!

38:39.308 --> 38:40.143
Shane no!

38:44.064 --> 38:44.897
Oh fuck!

38:46.149 --> 38:47.151
God, oh God!

38:55.533 --> 38:56.616
Hey hey hey hey hey.

38:56.618 --> 38:57.701
Breathe, breathe,
breathe, breathe.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.493
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

38:59.495 --> 39:01.120
I got it, I got it.

39:04.125 --> 39:05.375
There's something out there.

39:05.377 --> 39:06.754
She had him do it.

39:08.714 --> 39:09.547
Adam.

39:12.676 --> 39:13.884
Adam!

39:16.305 --> 39:17.138
Adam!

39:21.310 --> 39:22.143
Oh God!

39:23.020 --> 39:23.853
Adam!

39:27.399 --> 39:28.607
Adam, come on man!

39:28.609 --> 39:30.192
Where are you?

39:30.194 --> 39:32.196
Shane.

39:33.029 --> 39:33.862
Adam.

39:33.864 --> 39:35.864
Shane.

39:35.866 --> 39:39.451
- Adam, where are you, dude?
- I'm over here.

39:39.453 --> 39:40.954
- What?
- Over here.

39:41.955 --> 39:43.538
Where, where?

39:43.540 --> 39:44.873
I'm over here.

39:48.252 --> 39:49.752
You're okay.

39:49.754 --> 39:51.006
You're okay.

39:51.964 --> 39:55.007
- What are you doing?
- It can be Adam or Shane.

39:55.009 --> 39:56.553
You sure you wanna
take that risk?

39:57.721 --> 39:59.264
Shane, Adam?

40:01.892 --> 40:02.723
Come on guys.

40:02.725 --> 40:03.641
Guys, we gotta go.

40:03.643 --> 40:05.393
- Go, go, go!
- Outta here.

40:05.395 --> 40:06.645
- Go, go, go, go go.
- Here, help me with this.

40:06.647 --> 40:10.397
Come on.

40:10.399 --> 40:11.234
Okay.

40:13.654 --> 40:14.652
Go, go, go.

40:14.654 --> 40:15.694
We gotta get outta here.

40:15.696 --> 40:17.781
- Run!
- Wait!

40:17.783 --> 40:19.366
We can't leave.

40:19.368 --> 40:20.491
Why not?

40:20.493 --> 40:21.951
Tiff is still missing.

40:21.953 --> 40:23.495
Are you kidding?

40:23.497 --> 40:24.328
What do you think just
happened to Adam and Shane?

40:24.330 --> 40:26.498
We can't just give up.

40:26.500 --> 40:27.958
I don't think she's
missing, Jackie.

40:27.960 --> 40:30.794
Our lives are in danger
if we don't leave right now.

40:30.796 --> 40:31.920
I'm staying.

40:31.922 --> 40:34.422
Hey, don't be
stupid about this.

40:34.424 --> 40:35.883
You would if it was Kate.

40:41.806 --> 40:44.223
Just get Ryan to the hospital.

40:44.225 --> 40:45.766
I'll stay here with Jackie;
we'll look for Tiff.

40:45.768 --> 40:46.685
What are you, crazy?

40:46.687 --> 40:47.688
That's suicide.

40:48.939 --> 40:49.937
We trapped that thing
in the cellar, right?

40:49.939 --> 40:51.105
We should be safe.

40:52.359 --> 40:53.232
Jackie!

40:56.696 --> 40:57.738
Shit, run, run!

41:00.701 --> 41:02.786
Come on, get outta my way!

41:07.123 --> 41:08.748
You guys, we're trapped.

41:08.750 --> 41:10.708
Don't say that, we'll
find another way out.

41:10.710 --> 41:11.792
Right, Kate?

41:11.794 --> 41:13.712
Yes, yes, by the entry way.

41:13.714 --> 41:14.545
It's not far.

41:14.547 --> 41:15.464
- The door?
- Yeah.

41:15.466 --> 41:16.297
Move! Come on, let's go.

41:16.299 --> 41:17.133
Yeah.

41:19.261 --> 41:22.846
Hey,
come on.

41:22.848 --> 41:23.681
Come on.

41:25.058 --> 41:25.893
Goddammit.

41:27.352 --> 41:28.685
Yeah.

41:28.687 --> 41:29.643
- Come on.
- Push it.

41:29.645 --> 41:32.188
We're all gonna die here.

41:32.190 --> 41:34.357
Don't say that, we're
gonna find another way out.

41:34.359 --> 41:35.692
There is
no other way out.

41:35.694 --> 41:36.859
Katie, he said there's
only two entrances right?

41:36.861 --> 41:38.694
All right this is it, come on.

41:38.696 --> 41:40.696
Come on.

41:40.698 --> 41:43.533
We're all gonna end
up like Adam and Shane

41:43.535 --> 41:45.868
and Jackie and Tiff.

41:45.870 --> 41:47.078
Stop talking like that, Karen!

41:47.080 --> 41:49.205
We're gonna get
outta here, all right?

41:49.207 --> 41:50.209
We're all gonna
end up them.

41:58.091 --> 42:01.759
- Come on.
- You guys, she needs air!

42:01.761 --> 42:04.054
We can't get out, Becca.

42:04.056 --> 42:04.971
Didn't we pass the courtyard

42:04.973 --> 42:08.850
or something on the way in here?

42:08.852 --> 42:09.768
Yeah.

42:09.770 --> 42:11.103
If one of us can get over,

42:11.105 --> 42:11.978
maybe we can open the
door from the outside.

42:11.980 --> 42:12.812
- I'll lift you up?
- Yeah,

42:12.814 --> 42:13.647
can you get me up there?

42:13.649 --> 42:14.815
What if that doesn't work?

42:14.817 --> 42:15.899
Then it doesn't work, at
least we tried something.

42:15.901 --> 42:17.025
Come on.

42:17.027 --> 42:17.859
We have to think
through this, Todd.

42:17.861 --> 42:18.859
You got a better idea?

42:18.861 --> 42:19.736
Come on.

42:19.738 --> 42:20.821
Everybody, come on. Let's go.

42:20.823 --> 42:23.031
- Can you run?
- I can run.

42:23.033 --> 42:23.951
Okay, go.

42:29.790 --> 42:32.833
Just breathe.

42:32.835 --> 42:36.377
We're gonna be fine.

42:36.379 --> 42:39.047
- Fuck it, fuck it.
- Here.

42:39.049 --> 42:39.880
Do you need to sit down?

42:39.882 --> 42:40.882
Where?

42:40.884 --> 42:41.966
Hey, Eric!

42:47.808 --> 42:50.683
- Shit, okay.
- Okay, now breathe.

42:50.685 --> 42:51.518
Boo!

42:52.478 --> 42:53.353
- Todd?
- Oh my God!

42:53.355 --> 42:55.062
- What?
- Are you okay?

42:55.064 --> 42:56.355
- I saw a little girl.
- What happened?

42:56.357 --> 42:58.232
- Babe.
- Shit.

42:58.234 --> 43:00.359
I'm fine, I'm fine.

43:00.361 --> 43:03.904
- Shit.
- Ryan.

43:03.906 --> 43:07.783
- Guys, guys, look at Ryan.
- Holy shit.

43:07.785 --> 43:10.536
- I got it, I got it.
- We should call an ambulance!

43:10.538 --> 43:11.663
Come here.

43:11.665 --> 43:12.663
Ryan?

43:12.665 --> 43:13.665
Ryan, give it up.

43:13.667 --> 43:14.833
He's lost a lot of blood.

43:14.835 --> 43:15.875
No shit, Sherlock.

43:15.877 --> 43:17.502
Hey don't talk
to her like that.

43:17.504 --> 43:21.339
Okay, I can bandage him up
properly if I have my kit.

43:21.341 --> 43:22.257
Well where's that?

43:22.259 --> 43:23.510
It's back at base camp.

43:24.969 --> 43:26.221
- Okay.
- Deep breaths.

43:27.765 --> 43:31.016
Shit, okay let's go get it.

43:31.018 --> 43:32.478
No, dude come on.

43:33.978 --> 43:34.978
You're not thinking about
goin' back in there, are you?

43:34.980 --> 43:36.605
What other choice
do we have, man?

43:36.607 --> 43:39.274
That thing can clearly go
wherever the hell it wants.

43:39.276 --> 43:40.107
We gotta get outta here.

43:40.109 --> 43:40.942
I'll move Ryan, come on.

43:40.944 --> 43:42.569
Fuck!

43:42.571 --> 43:43.904
You all right, buddy?

43:43.906 --> 43:44.821
Come on, we're gonna
get you outta here.

43:44.823 --> 43:46.198
Come on, come on, come on.

43:46.200 --> 43:47.449
- Wake up, wake up, wake up.
- All right, come on buddy.

43:47.451 --> 43:48.285
- Let's do this.
- Oh fuck, all right.

44:01.131 --> 44:01.962
You all right, man?

44:01.964 --> 44:06.759
You're gonna be okay.

44:06.761 --> 44:12.556
Karen, can you bandage him up?

44:12.558 --> 44:13.391
Fuck.

44:18.524 --> 44:20.982
- Shit.
- What?

44:20.984 --> 44:23.859
I got nothing,
you got anything?

44:23.861 --> 44:25.402
Nothing.

44:25.404 --> 44:28.741
All right, Karen will
you watch him for me?

44:30.493 --> 44:33.286
Hey, where are you going?

44:33.288 --> 44:34.370
To see if I get service.

44:34.372 --> 44:36.915
- No, not by yourself.
- Why not?

44:36.917 --> 44:38.958
I'm going with you.

44:38.960 --> 44:40.877
Hey, I'm gonna go
with her all right?

44:40.879 --> 44:41.710
I'm gonna be okay.

44:41.712 --> 44:42.920
You stay here.

44:42.922 --> 44:46.218
- Okay, we gotta get moving.
- I'll be right back.

44:48.928 --> 44:49.886
I love you.

44:49.888 --> 44:50.886
- Okay, be safe.
- Stay safe.

44:50.888 --> 44:51.721
I'll be right back.

44:51.723 --> 44:52.933
Hey Katie, Katie!

44:53.892 --> 44:56.102
Katie, Katie hold on.

44:57.520 --> 44:58.354
Katie!

45:03.734 --> 45:05.025
- Kate.
- What?

45:05.027 --> 45:07.237
What's going on with you?

45:07.239 --> 45:09.948
Well let's see, four of
our closest friends are dead

45:09.950 --> 45:11.824
and Ryan's in desperate
need of medical attention,

45:11.826 --> 45:13.701
so how do you
expect me to react?

45:13.703 --> 45:15.995
You know what I mean,
you've been acting different.

45:15.997 --> 45:19.040
You're not the type to lash out
at people, especially Becca.

45:19.042 --> 45:21.208
Oh my God, this
is not the time

45:21.210 --> 45:23.210
to be having that discussion.

45:23.212 --> 45:24.879
When will be the time?

45:24.881 --> 45:25.922
'Cause we might not
make it outta here.

45:25.924 --> 45:28.049
If that's the case, I
don't wanna leave things

45:28.051 --> 45:29.676
like this between you and me.

45:29.678 --> 45:30.511
So what's up?

45:32.306 --> 45:33.140
Fine.

45:36.643 --> 45:39.560
I am thrilled for
your engagement.

45:39.562 --> 45:40.937
Our engagement, that's
really what this is about?

45:40.939 --> 45:43.105
I'm sure the two of you
will be very happy together.

45:43.107 --> 45:44.649
But you're not, so
what's the problem?

45:44.651 --> 45:45.484
You don't like Becca?

45:45.486 --> 45:46.319
I love Becca.

45:47.111 --> 45:48.238
Okay, so what is it?

45:50.073 --> 45:50.908
Come on.

45:53.576 --> 45:55.953
Why didn't you tell me you
were thinking of marrying her?

45:58.457 --> 46:00.748
I don't always
tell you everything.

46:00.750 --> 46:02.917
Oh that's bullshit, Todd!

46:02.919 --> 46:03.960
You've known her for six months.

46:03.962 --> 46:06.712
You've known me for
your entire life.

46:06.714 --> 46:08.214
Why did you keep that from me?

46:08.216 --> 46:10.091
Why did I have to find
out with everybody else?

46:10.093 --> 46:11.719
What else are you
keeping from me?

46:19.895 --> 46:21.563
What else are you
keeping from me?

46:24.315 --> 46:33.531
After graduation, we
were thinking about moving.

46:33.533 --> 46:34.367
Moving where?

46:35.785 --> 46:38.246
We don't know, just somewhere
better to raise a family.

46:43.835 --> 46:45.212
When are you gonna tell Mom?

46:48.966 --> 46:51.341
She already knows.

46:51.343 --> 46:53.176
Great, the last to know again.

46:53.178 --> 46:55.094
Thank you for that.

46:55.096 --> 46:56.429
I'm sorry, Katie.

46:56.431 --> 46:58.098
You don't have to
stay here either.

46:58.100 --> 47:02.060
I am not gonna be the one
who leaves mom alone again.

47:02.062 --> 47:03.855
But don't worry, we'll be fine.

47:04.814 --> 47:06.272
We won't need you.

47:06.274 --> 47:07.774
Don't be like this.

47:07.776 --> 47:08.609
Hey.

47:09.361 --> 47:10.779
Kate, he's awake.

47:13.281 --> 47:14.115
Katie.

47:15.116 --> 47:15.950
Hey, come on.

47:21.205 --> 47:22.915
I got it, I got it.

47:24.917 --> 47:29.754
You all right?

47:29.756 --> 47:30.672
Hey.

47:30.674 --> 47:32.966
- You okay?
- Yeah.

47:46.147 --> 47:47.440
Find anything in there?

47:50.194 --> 47:52.986
"But if we walk in the
light as he is in the light,

47:52.988 --> 47:54.698
"we have fellowship
with one another

47:55.823 --> 47:57.616
"and the blood of
Jesus Christ, his son,

47:57.618 --> 48:00.034
"cleans us from all sin.

48:00.036 --> 48:01.953
"The Lord has heard our prayers.

48:01.955 --> 48:03.621
"We kept the demon
and Amanda at bay

48:03.623 --> 48:05.790
"and had our
first restful night.

48:05.792 --> 48:08.167
"Tomorrow we shall
perform Amanda's exorcism

48:08.169 --> 48:13.255
"and remove the demon
that follows her."

48:13.257 --> 48:15.966
Maybe something on
here can help us.

48:15.968 --> 48:16.803
What's that?

48:17.721 --> 48:19.763
We found this in the files.

48:19.765 --> 48:21.808
Exorcism 666.

48:23.393 --> 48:26.228
Do we really wanna hear that?

48:26.230 --> 48:27.898
We should know what
we're up against.

48:31.401 --> 48:32.734
Is
that what happened

48:32.736 --> 48:36.196
to Sister Mary Roberts
and the other orphans?

48:36.198 --> 48:38.656
They
had to be punished.

48:38.658 --> 48:41.158
Where
are they, Amanda?

48:41.160 --> 48:42.995
He took
them into the dark.

48:44.455 --> 48:46.957
Is he
here with us now, Amanda?

48:46.959 --> 48:48.250
Yes.

48:48.252 --> 48:49.875
He doesn't want you to hurt me.

48:49.877 --> 48:51.210
We're not
here to hurt you, Amanda.

48:51.212 --> 48:53.254
We're only trying to help you.

48:53.256 --> 48:55.005
You wanna
take him away from me.

48:55.007 --> 48:56.132
You can't have him.

48:57.803 --> 48:58.926
- I
- can't see anything.

48:58.928 --> 49:02.221
Amanda, Amanda where are you?

49:02.223 --> 49:04.306
We wanna play
a game with you, Father.

49:04.308 --> 49:06.102
Father
Thomas turn on the lights.

49:07.562 --> 49:10.355
Demon I demand you to release
this poor child at once.

49:10.357 --> 49:12.399
Our Father, who art in Heaven.

49:15.779 --> 49:16.613
Make it stop.

49:19.323 --> 49:21.741
Oh my God, I can't
believe this is happening.

49:21.743 --> 49:24.118
We just have to hold
on a little longer.

49:24.120 --> 49:25.913
We're gonna make
it through this.

49:27.457 --> 49:28.291
How?

49:30.042 --> 49:30.877
Light.

49:33.172 --> 49:38.216
In the journal he said he
could keep her away with light.

49:38.218 --> 49:39.426
You're right.

49:39.428 --> 49:40.719
How are we
supposed to do that?

49:40.721 --> 49:44.306
All we have are flashlights.

49:44.308 --> 49:45.225
What do you need?

49:46.643 --> 49:49.895
In the folder we
found in the cabinet.

49:49.897 --> 49:51.187
What are you lookin' for?

49:51.189 --> 49:53.147
We found a picture.

49:53.149 --> 49:54.651
They were standing next to a

49:56.319 --> 49:57.321
- generator.
- Generator.

49:58.571 --> 50:00.571
The picture we
found of these nuns,

50:00.573 --> 50:03.074
they're standing by a generator.

50:04.620 --> 50:07.870
You guys, this is her.

50:07.872 --> 50:10.040
This is the little girl
that Todd and I saw.

50:10.042 --> 50:13.502
Amanda Peterson; she's
just a little girl.

50:13.504 --> 50:16.712
The ghost girl that has
a demon for best friends.

50:16.714 --> 50:20.926
- Can we stop her?
- Light's the answer.

50:20.928 --> 50:22.176
The generator's in the cellar.

50:22.178 --> 50:23.511
If we can get down
there and turn it on,

50:23.513 --> 50:25.971
maybe we can light this
place up and get outta here.

50:25.973 --> 50:27.681
Does anyone have experience
with a generator?

50:27.683 --> 50:28.975
Yeah, I do.

50:28.977 --> 50:30.937
My grandparents used to
have one on the farm.

50:33.189 --> 50:35.397
Okay, so Ryan and Eric
will go down to the cellar

50:35.399 --> 50:36.817
and the two of you
can go with Todd.

50:36.819 --> 50:38.695
No wait, I don't wanna
go anywhere without Eric.

50:40.279 --> 50:43.241
If you don't wanna go with
us Karen, you can go with them.

50:45.410 --> 50:46.409
Becca and Ryan also
go through the halls

50:46.411 --> 50:48.286
and try to distract this thing.

50:48.288 --> 50:50.246
Radio when it's safe.

50:50.248 --> 50:52.373
Seems like a really
stupid idea, guys.

50:52.375 --> 50:55.000
No if they can keep this
thing distracted long enough

50:55.002 --> 50:57.837
and we can turn the generator
on, no one'll get hurt.

50:57.839 --> 50:59.632
What if it's in
the cellar with you?

51:00.884 --> 51:02.551
Then you will
have to act fast.

51:02.553 --> 51:04.886
I don't really like this
idea of us splitting up.

51:04.888 --> 51:07.304
Just trust me, it'll work.

51:07.306 --> 51:11.100
We'll be fine.

51:11.102 --> 51:12.687
Okay, we'll go this way.

51:13.814 --> 51:17.274
Wait, take this with you.

51:17.276 --> 51:19.484
Set the motion sensor on
then put it in the hallway

51:19.486 --> 51:20.986
and maybe it can
give you a warning

51:20.988 --> 51:23.239
of something or someone's
coming after you.

51:27.326 --> 51:37.377
Good luck, guys.

51:41.424 --> 51:42.258
It's ready.

51:48.056 --> 51:48.891
Hey!

51:50.600 --> 51:52.141
- We're over here!
- We're over here!

51:52.143 --> 51:54.810
Come on, come and get us!

51:54.812 --> 51:56.103
Come on!

52:08.910 --> 52:10.659
(Becca screaming

52:10.661 --> 52:11.620
Go go go, now now!

52:11.622 --> 52:12.455
Run!

52:18.921 --> 52:19.754
There it is.

52:27.261 --> 52:28.096
Oh shit.

52:32.433 --> 52:34.768
Okay guys, what's wrong?

52:34.770 --> 52:38.437
Why won't it start?

52:38.439 --> 52:40.107
Shine the light.

52:40.109 --> 52:41.857
Shit, it's outta gas.

52:41.859 --> 52:45.821
Gas container, look
for a gas container.

52:49.201 --> 52:50.035
Come on!

53:06.468 --> 53:08.717
No don't get up,!

53:08.719 --> 53:09.555
Oh shit!

53:12.850 --> 53:14.518
Come on, go go go go!

53:19.605 --> 53:20.690
There it is.

53:23.067 --> 53:26.236
Turn off the lights.

53:26.238 --> 53:27.531
Amanda, is that you?

53:29.366 --> 53:31.366
You can't play
if you turn on the lights.

53:31.368 --> 53:33.370
We don't wanna
play your games.

53:35.080 --> 53:37.246
Amanda, we just wanna go home.

53:37.248 --> 53:38.834
I just wanna play.

53:40.627 --> 53:41.462
D'you hear me?

53:42.921 --> 53:45.212
We don't wanna play your
stupid games, little bitch!

53:45.214 --> 53:47.008
Why are
you being so mean?

53:51.263 --> 53:52.971
Oh my God, let's go.

53:52.973 --> 53:55.473
You guys, we have to
get the generator on.

53:55.475 --> 53:56.309
Let's go!

54:14.620 --> 54:15.453
No, no!

54:16.455 --> 54:17.831
Oh my God, no, no!

54:19.248 --> 54:20.248
Karen, we gotta go.

54:20.250 --> 54:21.415
We gotta go!

54:21.417 --> 54:24.421
- No, Eric no!
- Karen, we gotta go!

54:26.714 --> 54:27.547
Come on, it's too late.

54:27.549 --> 54:29.632
Come here.

54:32.721 --> 54:33.597
No, Eric!

54:37.683 --> 54:38.641
Don't move, don't move.

54:38.643 --> 54:39.477
Here.

54:42.189 --> 54:43.315
Where's Eric?

54:47.819 --> 54:50.112
Where the hell
are the bandages?

54:50.114 --> 54:51.156
They're right here.

54:57.578 --> 55:01.705
- What happened?
- This place happened.

55:01.707 --> 55:03.165
Oh, sweetie.

55:03.167 --> 55:05.669
I don't need your help.

55:05.671 --> 55:06.585
Leave me alone, please.

55:06.587 --> 55:24.645
Just leave me alone.

55:24.647 --> 55:26.355
So what do we do now?

55:26.357 --> 55:27.274
Could you
just give us a minute?

55:27.276 --> 55:28.482
We don't have a minute, Todd.

55:28.484 --> 55:30.234
Eric is dead and
her leg's all torn up.

55:30.236 --> 55:33.446
Could you please just
give us a goddamn minute?

55:39.413 --> 55:40.873
This all your fault.

55:43.542 --> 55:46.210
You should be the
one dead, not Eric.

55:47.837 --> 55:49.214
You're right, I'm sorry.

55:51.632 --> 55:53.091
I was just tryin' to help.

55:53.093 --> 55:54.467
I didn't think...

55:54.469 --> 56:08.732
That's your problem right
there, you don't think.

56:08.734 --> 56:09.567
So, what?

56:11.444 --> 56:13.654
Are we all gonna just
sit here and wait to die?

56:15.531 --> 56:18.199
We have to get
back to the cellar.

56:18.201 --> 56:21.368
Light is the only way
to stop this thing.

56:21.370 --> 56:23.163
We already found the generator.

56:23.165 --> 56:24.413
We just have to
fill it with gas,

56:24.415 --> 56:26.290
turn it on and then
we're home-free.

56:26.292 --> 56:27.583
You know that for a fact?

56:27.585 --> 56:28.752
No I do not know
that for a fact,

56:28.754 --> 56:31.339
but I have to trust
that we will be.

56:37.261 --> 56:39.721
I guess I better get used
to doing things without you.

56:39.723 --> 56:41.348
Stop being
such a bitch, Katie!

56:41.350 --> 56:42.641
Screw you, Todd.

56:42.643 --> 56:44.058
I can take care of myself.

56:44.060 --> 56:45.645
Yeah, you made
that real clear.

56:48.607 --> 56:49.855
Go ahead.

56:49.857 --> 56:51.482
Go off and enjoy your new life

56:51.484 --> 56:54.986
and leave the rest of us
behind, just like dad did.

56:54.988 --> 56:56.279
You know what?

56:56.281 --> 56:57.950
- Fuck you, Katie!
- Fuck you, Todd!

57:03.622 --> 57:07.082
All right, you're
gonna be okay.

57:07.084 --> 57:08.625
It's all right.

57:15.384 --> 57:28.437
Karen.

57:28.439 --> 57:29.272
Karen.

57:45.705 --> 57:46.539
Eric?

57:49.250 --> 57:50.252
It's all my fault.

57:51.419 --> 57:53.377
I never should've
suggested this place.

57:53.379 --> 57:54.506
Hey, don't say that.

57:55.716 --> 57:57.716
We had no idea what
we were up against

57:57.718 --> 57:59.219
and you couldn't have known.

58:01.721 --> 58:03.723
I can't let anyone
else die because of me.

58:05.517 --> 58:07.266
I have to get the
generator up and running.

58:07.268 --> 58:08.726
It's too dangerous.

58:08.728 --> 58:13.647
We should just stay here
and wait until morning.

58:13.649 --> 58:15.900
We may not live
that long, Ryan.

58:15.902 --> 58:17.027
We have the fireplace.

58:17.029 --> 58:32.750
It'll keep us safe.

58:32.752 --> 58:34.421
Does it still hurt?

58:36.714 --> 58:38.591
I'm hangin' in there.

58:39.843 --> 58:40.803
I'm so sorry.

58:45.431 --> 58:49.016
Hey, look at me.

58:49.018 --> 58:50.353
Hey, come here.

58:56.442 --> 58:58.069
You have nothin'
to be sorry for.

59:01.114 --> 59:02.533
I would do anything for you.

59:06.828 --> 59:11.288
In case we don't make
it out of here alive,

59:11.290 --> 59:13.626
I just want you to know that.

59:58.756 --> 59:59.589
Eric?

01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:11.185
Eric?

01:00:28.826 --> 01:00:31.995
Please, I don't want to die.

01:00:31.997 --> 01:00:35.748
I'm not
gonna hurt you.

01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:37.792
But your friend will, right?

01:00:37.794 --> 01:00:40.296
Only if you
don't play the game right.

01:00:42.674 --> 01:00:45.549
I just want Eric
back and go home.

01:00:45.551 --> 01:00:47.803
I know where he is.

01:00:47.805 --> 01:00:49.304
Where?

01:00:49.306 --> 01:00:50.931
I can't tell you.

01:00:50.933 --> 01:00:51.767
Why not?

01:00:52.935 --> 01:00:54.810
You have
to play the game first

01:00:54.812 --> 01:00:57.853
and if you win, I'll
take you to him.

01:00:57.855 --> 01:00:58.897
And if I lose?

01:00:58.899 --> 01:01:01.274
You get
to stay here with me.

01:01:01.276 --> 01:01:05.656
If you wanna play, you have
to turn off your flashlight.

01:01:30.513 --> 01:01:31.640
Now what?

01:01:32.765 --> 01:01:34.225
Come and find me.

01:01:56.497 --> 01:01:57.540
Okay, okay.

01:01:59.084 --> 01:02:12.846
Okay, okay.

01:02:16.393 --> 01:02:18.976
Eric?

01:02:18.978 --> 01:02:21.312
Eric, Eric?

01:02:22.899 --> 01:02:25.567
I'm so sorry, I couldn't see.

01:02:27.654 --> 01:02:28.652
Help me!

01:02:28.654 --> 01:02:33.660
Help me, no!

01:02:35.328 --> 01:02:37.747
No, please somebody help me!

01:02:39.917 --> 01:02:44.169
Somebody!

01:02:44.171 --> 01:02:45.629
Help me!

01:02:45.631 --> 01:02:47.464
Help me, please!

01:02:47.466 --> 01:02:50.716
Somebody help me.

01:02:50.718 --> 01:02:55.723
Help!

01:02:56.808 --> 01:02:57.642
Jesus.

01:03:09.654 --> 01:03:21.123
- Karen.
- Eric?

01:03:21.125 --> 01:03:22.167
Eric?

01:03:44.189 --> 01:03:45.815
Did you tell her
we were moving?

01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.942
Yeah.

01:03:49.902 --> 01:03:53.237
Well you thought she
might act this way.

01:03:53.239 --> 01:03:56.116
Yeah, but I thought she
might at least be happy for us.

01:03:56.118 --> 01:03:57.411
She's your sister.

01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.413
Of course she wants
us to be happy,

01:04:01.665 --> 01:04:03.333
just like you want
her to be happy.

01:04:18.223 --> 01:04:20.140
Hey, where are you going?

01:04:20.142 --> 01:04:22.433
We're gonna smooth
things over with Kate.

01:04:22.435 --> 01:04:24.393
No no no, just
come on, stay here.

01:04:24.395 --> 01:04:25.978
- No, Todd.
- You're hurt.

01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:27.855
Yeah, I might die
if I just stay here

01:04:27.857 --> 01:04:29.609
sitting on my ass doing nothing.

01:04:30.527 --> 01:04:32.196
We're not gonna stay in here.

01:04:33.363 --> 01:04:36.364
We're gonna get married,
have lots of babies

01:04:36.366 --> 01:04:38.035
and we're not gonna die here.

01:04:41.038 --> 01:04:42.828
Now, I have a wedding
to prepare for

01:04:42.830 --> 01:04:44.330
and you need to patch things up

01:04:44.332 --> 01:04:47.625
with my future sister-in-law
before it's too late.

01:04:47.627 --> 01:04:49.377
I know, that thing
hasn't come after us yet.

01:04:49.379 --> 01:04:50.670
I think the fire's working.

01:04:50.672 --> 01:04:51.673
Let's just stay put.

01:04:53.091 --> 01:04:54.632
I've never known
you to be somebody

01:04:54.634 --> 01:04:56.301
who sits on the sidelines, Todd.

01:04:56.303 --> 01:04:57.219
This is different.

01:04:57.221 --> 01:04:58.136
This isn't a game.

01:04:58.138 --> 01:04:59.598
I know this isn't a game.

01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:04.141
This is our life and
you're just sitting here

01:05:04.143 --> 01:05:05.145
stubborn to help them.

01:05:15.823 --> 01:05:18.658
Now are you with me or am
I doin' this by myself?

01:05:21.285 --> 01:05:22.578
I'm with you.

01:05:23.747 --> 01:05:25.913
I'm with you all the way.

01:05:25.915 --> 01:05:27.084
Okay, come on.

01:05:36.884 --> 01:05:38.676
You shouldn't be
walking on that.

01:05:38.678 --> 01:05:41.513
I think I'll survive.

01:05:41.515 --> 01:05:43.306
Wishful thinking.

01:05:43.308 --> 01:05:44.143
Hey.

01:05:45.268 --> 01:05:47.435
Sorry, it's hard
to be optimistic

01:05:47.437 --> 01:05:49.564
when most of the people
you know are gone.

01:05:51.692 --> 01:05:52.860
Poor Karen, she...

01:05:54.111 --> 01:05:56.027
- Son of a bitch.
- Where'd she go?

01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:57.194
- Karen!
- We gotta find her.

01:05:57.196 --> 01:05:58.237
No no no, you're not going.

01:05:58.239 --> 01:05:59.321
It's way too dangerous.

01:05:59.323 --> 01:06:00.574
So we're just gonna leave her?

01:06:00.576 --> 01:06:02.116
No no Katie, she's right.

01:06:02.118 --> 01:06:03.409
Becca can't go
anywhere, she's hurt.

01:06:03.411 --> 01:06:04.745
Let's just wait
here 'til morning.

01:06:04.747 --> 01:06:07.205
- We'll look for Karen then.
- Exactly.

01:06:07.207 --> 01:06:09.165
My God,
between the two of you

01:06:09.167 --> 01:06:12.169
just sitting around and
doin' nothing, it's pathetic.

01:06:12.171 --> 01:06:13.629
These are your friends.

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:16.382
Our friends.

01:06:17.216 --> 01:06:18.384
Let's go find them.

01:06:19.553 --> 01:06:21.305
Fuck this Amanda
and fuck this demon.

01:06:45.245 --> 01:06:47.203
- No, Becca!
- Let's go.

01:06:47.205 --> 01:06:49.455
Becca!

01:06:49.457 --> 01:06:51.290
- Todd!
- Todd!

01:06:51.292 --> 01:06:52.333
Todd!

01:06:52.335 --> 01:06:53.212
Fuck, Todd!

01:06:54.421 --> 01:06:57.589
Come on, we'll go
around the back.

01:06:57.591 --> 01:06:59.009
Where is she?!

01:07:00.676 --> 01:07:01.592
Come on, you asshole.

01:07:01.594 --> 01:07:02.803
I'm right here, take me instead.

01:07:02.805 --> 01:07:06.223
Please, she doesn't
deserve this!

01:07:06.225 --> 01:07:10.351
Becca!

01:07:21.864 --> 01:07:22.698
I'm sorry.

01:07:34.627 --> 01:07:36.585
- Oh shit.
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:07:36.587 --> 01:07:38.212
Not gonna hurt you.

01:07:39.466 --> 01:07:41.716
Stay here with me.

01:07:52.395 --> 01:07:53.689
Security guard.

01:07:56.399 --> 01:07:58.150
- Oh God, hey!
- Hey!

01:07:58.152 --> 01:08:03.737
- Up here!
- Hey!

01:08:03.739 --> 01:08:05.699
- Here!
- Up here!

01:08:05.701 --> 01:08:07.491
Why isn't be seeing us?

01:08:07.493 --> 01:08:08.534
I don't know, we
need to keep moving.

01:08:08.536 --> 01:08:11.830
- Are you sure?
- Come on.

01:08:11.832 --> 01:08:13.330
Not gonna hurt you.

01:08:13.332 --> 01:08:16.000
Come on.

01:08:16.002 --> 01:08:16.917
Let's go back.

01:08:16.919 --> 01:08:17.835
Shh.

01:08:22.968 --> 01:08:23.801
Fuck.

01:08:28.389 --> 01:08:30.265
Ryan, what are you doing?

01:08:30.267 --> 01:08:31.098
Trust me.

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:32.227
No, Ryan wait!

01:08:34.145 --> 01:08:34.979
Ryan!

01:08:43.613 --> 01:08:45.156
Where are you?!

01:08:46.617 --> 01:08:48.825
I'm not afraid of you!

01:08:50.996 --> 01:08:52.411
Do you wanna play a game?

01:08:52.412 --> 01:08:54.538
I'm not gonna
let you hurt her.

01:08:54.541 --> 01:08:56.542
She's not playin'
the game, silly.

01:08:57.502 --> 01:08:59.085
You are.

01:08:59.087 --> 01:09:00.795
You have to come find me.

01:09:00.796 --> 01:09:02.421
Just get outta here
and leave us alone!

01:09:02.424 --> 01:09:03.839
Ryan, play her game.

01:09:03.841 --> 01:09:05.803
I'm not gonna play
her stupid games!

01:09:22.693 --> 01:09:24.694
I love you, Kate.

01:09:24.696 --> 01:09:26.237
What are you doing?

01:09:26.238 --> 01:09:28.698
Ryan?

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:31.325
Come on, over here!

01:09:31.327 --> 01:09:33.078
Come get me!

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:33.912
Over here!

01:09:53.434 --> 01:09:54.268
Ryan?

01:09:56.394 --> 01:10:09.448
Ryan!

01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:14.455
If you just had
to play her game.

01:10:15.872 --> 01:10:20.126
If you just had
to play her game.

01:10:26.175 --> 01:10:28.635
You just have to play her game.

01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:34.974
Todd?

01:10:36.143 --> 01:10:36.975
Todd?

01:10:36.977 --> 01:10:41.521
Come in, Todd.

01:10:41.523 --> 01:10:47.194
Please come in, Todd.

01:10:47.196 --> 01:10:48.029
Yeah?

01:10:49.572 --> 01:10:50.782
I have an idea.

01:10:53.618 --> 01:10:55.910
Just give it up, Kate.

01:10:55.912 --> 01:10:57.536
What's the point?

01:10:57.538 --> 01:10:59.455
No listen to me, Todd.

01:10:59.457 --> 01:11:00.915
I'm not ready to give up.

01:11:00.917 --> 01:11:03.250
Not yet, not on us.

01:11:03.252 --> 01:11:05.964
I know what to do
but I need you.

01:11:06.924 --> 01:11:08.050
Please, Todd.

01:11:09.885 --> 01:11:11.468
We're not giving up.

01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:13.263
Listen, I have a plan.

01:11:37.787 --> 01:11:38.621
Amanda?

01:11:49.882 --> 01:11:51.135
I wanna play a game.

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:07.691
Do you wanna play a game?

01:12:07.693 --> 01:12:11.527
I do, but I wanna
be the one who hides.

01:12:11.529 --> 01:12:13.070
Okay.

01:12:13.072 --> 01:12:16.950
One, two, three,

01:12:16.952 --> 01:12:18.370
four, five, six.

01:12:59.077 --> 01:13:00.036
I found you.

01:13:03.831 --> 01:13:04.665
Todd, now.

01:13:09.837 --> 01:13:11.463
Oh, come on.

01:14:07.312 --> 01:14:08.313
Did it work?

01:14:16.447 --> 01:14:17.695
Yes, it worked.

01:15:06.746 --> 01:15:14.460
Run, run!

01:15:21.053 --> 01:15:22.761
Kate, just go!

01:15:22.763 --> 01:15:24.762
I can't leave without you.

01:15:24.764 --> 01:15:27.140
- You can, please let go.
- No no.

01:15:27.142 --> 01:15:28.182
No!

01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:30.017
No no no!

01:15:30.019 --> 01:15:31.645
No, Todd!

01:15:31.647 --> 01:15:39.485
Todd, no don't leave.

01:17:47.866 --> 01:17:49.490
"To
