Previously on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:40.147 --> 00:42.853
Mr. Plimpton Sr., how
wonderful to see you!

00:44.318 --> 00:47.052
- Pop, you're here.
- Were you asleep?

00:47.077 --> 00:51.251
- Were you feeling ti-ti?
- No, I was, um, I was... sick?

00:51.276 --> 00:52.244
AUDRA: Hello, Bert.

00:52.269 --> 00:53.517
How long have you been a
diagnosed schizophrenic?

00:53.542 --> 00:54.708
16 years.

00:55.011 --> 00:56.208
DARRYL: Maybe having a baby

00:56.263 --> 00:59.339
started out as a whim, but it's
what I want for my life now.

00:59.364 --> 01:01.677
You don't want a baby, maybe not ever.

01:02.059 --> 01:03.365
This is not Josh's fault.

01:03.390 --> 01:04.759
It's not even about Josh.

01:05.171 --> 01:05.961
Maybe it never was.

01:05.963 --> 01:07.162
JOSH: I'm spiraling.

01:07.164 --> 01:09.698
I feel like there's no ground
under me, you know?

01:09.700 --> 01:11.099
I'm here for you.

01:12.336 --> 01:14.736
(Rebecca moaning)

01:17.970 --> 01:19.970
_

01:19.995 --> 01:22.301
(moans softly)

01:22.668 --> 01:24.980
- Whoa. Good morning.
- (giggles): Hi.

01:25.481 --> 01:26.681
Hi, how are you?

01:27.168 --> 01:29.084
I am so great.

01:29.086 --> 01:30.385
(chuckles)

01:30.387 --> 01:31.396
Hey.

01:31.657 --> 01:33.054
I have an idea.

01:33.641 --> 01:36.817
Why don't you... take the day off today

01:37.056 --> 01:40.575
and let's do something fun like...

01:40.841 --> 01:42.541
go to Raging Waters.

01:42.543 --> 01:45.544
Oh, I'd love to if water
parks weren't disgusting.

01:45.546 --> 01:47.479
Oh... And I have a deposition today.

01:47.481 --> 01:50.215
But, then tonight, I'm
taking you to a fancy dinner

01:50.217 --> 01:51.317
in Beverly Hills.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.551
(squeals): What?

01:52.553 --> 01:53.552
Yeah, I made reservations.

01:53.554 --> 01:54.687
It's a bit of schlep, but...

01:54.689 --> 01:55.888
(laughs) Wait, since when

01:55.890 --> 01:57.089
do you use the word schlep?

01:57.091 --> 01:58.691
Oh, well, I've been
watching a lot of Seinfeld.

01:58.693 --> 01:59.992
I have a Jewish girlfriend, after all.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.026
(squeals): Girlfriend?!

02:01.028 --> 02:02.995
Wow, you are squealing a lot today.

02:02.997 --> 02:04.730
(squeals): Only 'cause
you're such a mensch.

02:04.732 --> 02:06.532
- Oh, oh, this again, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

02:06.534 --> 02:07.700
Oh, all right.

02:07.702 --> 02:10.068
(both moaning)

02:10.071 --> 02:11.103
(shower running)

02:11.105 --> 02:12.638
How's your shower?

02:14.220 --> 02:16.063
He can't hear me, it's fine.

02:16.610 --> 02:18.177
(sighs contently)

02:18.179 --> 02:19.745
(birds chirping)

02:19.747 --> 02:21.413
(chuckles)

02:29.590 --> 02:32.091
(sniffs)

02:34.195 --> 02:37.096
Oh,
Nathan-ay-el.

02:37.098 --> 02:39.031
I scooped up his shirt and I smelled it.

02:39.033 --> 02:41.800
But I didn't just smell it,
I-I buried my whole face in it.

02:41.802 --> 02:43.635
And it smelled so good.

02:43.637 --> 02:45.537
It smelled like the
yummiest parts of his armpit.

02:45.539 --> 02:47.373
- I wanted to live in it.
- Don't panic.

02:47.375 --> 02:50.142
Okay? You felt intimacy
and affection, that's okay.

02:50.144 --> 02:52.177
But is it, though? For me,

02:52.179 --> 02:53.679
first it starts out as
intimacy and affection

02:53.681 --> 02:55.013
and then I get one little love kernel...

02:55.015 --> 02:56.648
That's what I call them...
And the next thing you know,

02:56.650 --> 02:58.217
you know, I'm buying a
shrub costume and hanging

02:58.219 --> 03:00.919
someone's teddy bear from a
closet rod by a karate belt.

03:00.921 --> 03:02.621
- What?
- We'll talk about that later.

03:02.623 --> 03:04.038
The point is,

03:04.063 --> 03:06.959
I am worried how much I'm into this guy.

03:06.961 --> 03:09.561
Is it bad? Is-is-is it bad?
Please tell me it's not bad.

03:09.563 --> 03:10.796
It feels so good, but is it bad?

03:10.798 --> 03:12.264
Rebecca, you're here.

03:12.266 --> 03:14.967
You're in therapy, working
hard, addressing your issues.

03:14.969 --> 03:16.902
Okay, all you have to
do is slow down a bit.

03:16.904 --> 03:19.371
Just be mindful as you get
to know Nathaniel better.

03:19.396 --> 03:21.707
Okay, be mindful as I
get to know him better.

03:21.709 --> 03:22.738
I can do that.

03:22.763 --> 03:24.430
Just one more thing.

03:27.148 --> 03:28.080
Oh, lord.

03:28.082 --> 03:29.548
Is it bad that I'm wearing this?

03:29.550 --> 03:31.617
It's not great.

03:33.902 --> 03:35.636
PAULA: Hey, Darryl. You ready?

03:35.661 --> 03:37.776
We got some things to go
over before the deposition.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.999
What is that? Is that a hooker catalog?

03:40.785 --> 03:41.767
It's not safe for work, buddy.

03:42.121 --> 03:44.380
Hey, while I'm busting
your balls, I got to say,

03:44.972 --> 03:46.987
it stinks in here.

03:47.012 --> 03:49.222
The taxidermy, the hides, the feathers.

03:49.247 --> 03:51.514
There's so much dead Southwestern stuff

03:51.516 --> 03:53.750
here, it's like CSI: New Mexico.

03:53.752 --> 03:54.918
This is my heritage.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.186
Honey, if you bought it at a
gas station, it ain't heritage.

03:57.188 --> 03:59.699
So, can you put away the
hooker book and let's go.

03:59.715 --> 04:01.096
This is not a hooker book.

04:01.121 --> 04:02.520
In and amongst these pages

04:02.522 --> 04:04.840
is the potential mother of my child.

04:05.144 --> 04:06.457
You mean, a surrogate?

04:06.504 --> 04:08.638
No, the surrogate is a nice lady

04:08.640 --> 04:11.341
from Chino Hills whose already done this
for a few other families.

04:11.343 --> 04:13.916
These are the egg donors.

04:13.941 --> 04:17.041
These are the women whose DNA
I'm gonna be commingling with.

04:17.065 --> 04:19.176
Wow, Darryl.

04:20.488 --> 04:22.346
I got to say, I am proud of you.

04:22.371 --> 04:23.904
I thought after your breakup,

04:23.906 --> 04:25.660
you would just dissolve into a puddle,

04:25.685 --> 04:28.008
but you are forging ahead all alone.

04:28.010 --> 04:30.210
That's exactly the problem.

04:30.212 --> 04:32.479
I feel like I'm picking
a future for this baby

04:32.481 --> 04:34.191
and it's all on me.

04:34.363 --> 04:35.826
What if I pick the wrong person?

04:36.371 --> 04:39.207
- What if I mess this up?
- (sighs)

04:39.232 --> 04:41.532
I am trying not to meddle
in people's lives so much,

04:41.557 --> 04:43.190
but I can see you need help.

04:43.192 --> 04:45.993
Also, catalog shopping
and judging people

04:45.995 --> 04:47.895
are two of my best events, so...

04:47.897 --> 04:50.230
(laughs) why don't I
just pull up a tom-tom

04:50.232 --> 04:54.001
and take a look.

04:54.003 --> 04:55.669
(clears throat) That's
a priceless antique.

04:55.671 --> 04:58.739
Oh, please, I know off-price
retail when I see it.

04:59.574 --> 05:02.683
Oh, this is easy. Here we go.

05:02.708 --> 05:04.933
Okay, rapid-fire:

05:05.147 --> 05:06.801
Crooked nose, snaggletooth,

05:06.832 --> 05:08.769
from Nevada, weird mole,

05:08.988 --> 05:11.151
dumb scarf, likes cats,

05:11.153 --> 05:13.454
dimple on one side, clearly drunk,

05:13.456 --> 05:15.155
no chin, sloping chin,

05:15.157 --> 05:16.760
three chins, vegetarian.

05:16.785 --> 05:19.268
Oh, my God, I didn't
notice all these bad things.

05:19.293 --> 05:20.861
I don't want my child to go through life

05:20.863 --> 05:22.729
with something like just one dimple.

05:22.731 --> 05:24.598
It's already gonna have just one parent.

05:24.808 --> 05:27.634
Aw, Darryl. Darryl,
don't worry about that.

05:27.636 --> 05:29.536
I mean, yeah, okay, they'll
only have one parent,

05:29.538 --> 05:31.605
but... it's a good one.

05:31.607 --> 05:33.207
You think I'm a good parent?

05:33.209 --> 05:34.374
I do.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.376
You know, the first time
I saw you with Madison,

05:36.378 --> 05:37.444
you know what I thought?

05:37.446 --> 05:40.465
“Oh, this is what he's good at”"

05:41.457 --> 05:44.751
Hey, when do we get to go
through the guy catalog?

05:44.974 --> 05:46.160
What do you mean?

05:46.185 --> 05:47.588
I'm providing all the guy stuff.

05:47.590 --> 05:48.520
Really?

05:48.791 --> 05:51.959
So... all your stuff still works?

05:51.961 --> 05:53.393
It's not expired?

05:53.942 --> 05:55.562
Well, I don't know.

05:55.564 --> 05:56.897
I mean...

05:56.899 --> 05:58.065
they haven't tested it yet.

05:58.067 --> 06:00.334
Oh, my God, what if my guy stuff is bad?

06:00.336 --> 06:01.535
I didn't even think of that.

06:01.537 --> 06:02.778
Tell you what.

06:02.803 --> 06:05.906
You go to the doctor right
now, get your mayonnaise tested.

06:05.908 --> 06:07.989
While you are doing that, I...

06:08.143 --> 06:11.785
will find us... the right girl.

06:12.014 --> 06:13.914
Don't we have to go to the deposition?

06:13.916 --> 06:15.549
Oh. (groans)

06:15.551 --> 06:16.650
You go.

06:16.652 --> 06:18.252
That is boring compared to this.

06:18.254 --> 06:21.477
This is a chance to
create the ultimate human.

06:21.876 --> 06:23.156
(laughs diabolically)

06:23.330 --> 06:24.697
Get out. Go.

06:26.506 --> 06:28.073
Oh... Mmm...

06:28.731 --> 06:30.764
That was really good
Italian food tonight.

06:31.118 --> 06:33.617
Ooh. You know what was even better?

06:34.203 --> 06:36.270
I'm gonna say the sex we just had.

06:36.295 --> 06:37.867
- Yep.
- Mmm.

06:38.741 --> 06:41.109
Hey, I was thinking about it and...

06:42.044 --> 06:43.766
I want to get to know each other better.

06:43.891 --> 06:46.046
Outside of the, the sex.

06:46.048 --> 06:48.909
Okay, yeah, let's do it.

06:48.934 --> 06:50.250
Yeah. Uh, all right.

06:50.252 --> 06:51.952
Let me think of a question for you.

06:51.954 --> 06:53.754
Um...

06:53.756 --> 06:55.389
Ooh! Okay, here's one.

06:55.391 --> 06:58.357
- Tell me about your childhood.
- Well, I don't know,

06:58.382 --> 06:59.726
I don't think we need
to talk about that.

06:59.728 --> 07:01.495
Oh, no, no, please, tell me.

07:01.497 --> 07:04.581
I want to know, what was little
Nathaniel's life like? Hmm?

07:05.253 --> 07:08.096
Well, um, okay, my parents...

07:08.121 --> 07:11.081
are... not super warm.

07:11.106 --> 07:13.240
Um, I was kind of a lonely kid.

07:13.242 --> 07:14.341
I didn't have any siblings.

07:14.343 --> 07:15.842
I was good friends with the gardener,

07:15.844 --> 07:17.875
which is why I hablo español.

07:17.900 --> 07:19.246
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

07:19.248 --> 07:21.915
I'm just picturing,
like, little Nathaniel

07:21.917 --> 07:24.651
wandering around, little-little bow tie

07:24.653 --> 07:26.753
and knee socks like Prince George.

07:26.755 --> 07:28.322
(chuckles) Okay, well, it wasn't so bad.

07:28.324 --> 07:30.680
My mom and I, uh, we actually
have a pretty good relationship.

07:30.705 --> 07:33.560
Um... my dad and I...

07:33.562 --> 07:34.861
not so much.

07:34.863 --> 07:36.630
Our relationship consists mainly

07:36.632 --> 07:39.071
of him glowering and me cowering.

07:39.431 --> 07:41.331
Sometimes I wish we were closer.

07:41.537 --> 07:42.618
You know?

07:42.643 --> 07:44.710
Or close at all.

07:45.019 --> 07:48.220
Or like, knew each other.

07:49.645 --> 07:53.981
Wow, I've, uh, I've
never said that to anyone.

07:53.983 --> 07:55.329
Really?

07:55.354 --> 07:57.184
I mean, I've talked to Esteban about it,

07:57.186 --> 07:59.553
but I've never had a
girlfriend who, you know,

07:59.555 --> 08:00.918
wants to get to know me like you do.

08:01.309 --> 08:03.667
Well, have you talked to
your father about this?

08:03.692 --> 08:05.125
Have you told him you
wish you were closer?

08:05.127 --> 08:06.159
You should tell him.

08:06.161 --> 08:07.394
No, God, I could never.

08:07.396 --> 08:09.296
He should know how sweet you are.

08:09.298 --> 08:10.731
- Am I?
- Yes.

08:10.764 --> 08:12.610
Wow, it's crazy that you think that.

08:12.635 --> 08:13.934
I just... (sighs)

08:13.936 --> 08:16.269
I just wish there was some
way for your father to know

08:16.271 --> 08:18.505
how wonderful you are.

08:18.806 --> 08:20.407
PAULA: She's perfect.

08:20.409 --> 08:21.908
Look.

08:21.910 --> 08:24.845
Number 456H76.

08:24.847 --> 08:26.380
I have been through this entire book

08:26.382 --> 08:28.315
and she is the only acceptable one.

08:28.317 --> 08:30.384
College educated, doesn't
smoke, left-handed...

08:30.386 --> 08:32.219
That means creative. When
asked for their pastimes,

08:32.221 --> 08:34.221
she's the only one who did not
mention the beach or her dog

08:34.222 --> 08:35.688
or going to the beach with her dog.

08:35.691 --> 08:37.524
Also, no duck lips, no contouring,

08:37.525 --> 08:40.494
no fake eyelashes, no
posing on a flamingo float.

08:40.496 --> 08:41.754
She is the one.

08:42.301 --> 08:43.764
I don't even have a second choice.

08:43.765 --> 08:45.799
Oh, yeah, she looks nice.

08:45.801 --> 08:47.534
She's got kind eyes.

08:47.786 --> 08:49.362
Your welcome.

08:51.312 --> 08:52.101
Yeah!

08:52.126 --> 08:55.694
Hello. I would like to place
an order for Mr. Whitefeather.

08:55.719 --> 09:00.714
We would like one egg
from number 456H76, please.

09:04.542 --> 09:05.953
What do you mean it's not available?

09:08.924 --> 09:13.226
So, you have it, but I can't have it?

09:15.228 --> 09:17.295
Do you have the egg or not?

09:19.301 --> 09:20.608
(yells): It's in the...

09:20.805 --> 09:22.342
It's in the catalog.

09:22.819 --> 09:23.914
(groans)

09:23.939 --> 09:25.338
It's unbelievable.

09:25.340 --> 09:27.239
Apparently these women can
just opt out of being donors

09:27.443 --> 09:29.242
whenever they want,
even though their eggs

09:29.244 --> 09:31.011
are still in the vault.

09:31.013 --> 09:33.438
Oh, it's so unfair, frustrating.

09:33.882 --> 09:35.482
♪ Coffee time George ♪

09:35.484 --> 09:37.184
♪ Time for George's coffee ♪

09:37.186 --> 09:39.219
♪ A little time just for George? ♪

09:39.221 --> 09:41.088
♪ He's gonna make himself a cup ♪

09:41.090 --> 09:43.857
- ♪ He's gonna drink it up, he's... ♪
- REBECCA: Psst.

09:43.859 --> 09:45.759
Oh, hey, Rebecca.

09:45.761 --> 09:47.694
How are you? It's good to see you.

09:47.696 --> 09:49.563
Shut up. Just meet me
in the bathroom now.

09:49.862 --> 09:51.565
Ladies', mens', what's happening?

09:51.567 --> 09:53.533
- (Rebecca sighs)
- What are you doing?

09:53.535 --> 09:55.784
I mean, why are we sneaking around?

09:56.471 --> 09:58.004
Okay, listen.

09:58.029 --> 09:58.979
Cool. No one's here.

09:59.004 --> 10:00.507
I don't work here anymore

10:00.509 --> 10:02.142
and I just can't deal with
people right now, being like,

10:02.144 --> 10:03.977
“Oh, how are you? Are
you feeling better?”

10:03.979 --> 10:05.445
And, “I'm glad you're not dead”"

10:05.447 --> 10:07.694
and, “If you were so depressed,
why didn't you lose weight?”

10:07.719 --> 10:09.649
(gasps) I don't think
anybody would say that.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.485
I like your very normal body.

10:11.487 --> 10:12.753
I think it's brave.

10:12.755 --> 10:14.154
Blech. Okay.

10:14.156 --> 10:16.156
Point is, I just can't
deal with people right now.

10:16.158 --> 10:18.992
But, I need you to do something for me.

10:18.994 --> 10:21.595
I don't have access to the
company database anymore

10:21.597 --> 10:24.965
and I need you to forward
me Nathaniel Sr.'s calendar.

10:24.967 --> 10:26.233
I'll tell you why. I'm gonna

10:26.235 --> 10:29.002
accidentally... on purpose...
Run into Nathaniel Sr.

10:29.004 --> 10:31.571
So I can repair his
relationship with Nathaniel.

10:32.127 --> 10:33.607
He needs to know how wonderful

10:33.609 --> 10:36.443
and sweet and thoughtful Nathaniel is.

10:36.445 --> 10:39.679
- My Nathaniel?
- Yes, our Nathaniel!

10:40.287 --> 10:42.849
For instance, he always makes sure

10:42.851 --> 10:45.559
that I am taken care of
first, if you get my drift,

10:45.584 --> 10:47.821
and his dad needs to
know things like that.

10:47.823 --> 10:50.086
Okay. Yeah, no, I don't
think this is a good idea.

10:50.118 --> 10:51.117
Shut up!

10:52.094 --> 10:54.004
I'm sorry. That was mean.

10:54.782 --> 10:56.062
Shut up.

10:56.087 --> 10:58.305
Just get me Nathaniel Sr.'s calendar.

10:58.330 --> 11:00.148
I don't think that's a good idea.

11:00.173 --> 11:03.403
It is an invasion of privacy,
and I don't work for you.

11:03.405 --> 11:04.671
Okay, you know what? I respect that.

11:04.673 --> 11:06.106
It's just, if you don't do this,

11:06.108 --> 11:07.284
I will try to kill myself again,

11:07.309 --> 11:09.440
and this time, I'll succeed,
and the note will blame you.

11:09.578 --> 11:11.077
Yeah, that's what I thought. Okay, so,

11:11.079 --> 11:12.712
come on, scurry and
get it. (snaps fingers)

11:12.714 --> 11:15.282
Otherwise, uh, uh...
(imitates rope pull, gunshot)

11:15.315 --> 11:17.081
Oh, my God. I'm just...

11:19.000 --> 11:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:26.776 --> 11:28.076
(sighs)

11:28.078 --> 11:29.400
Joshua, darling,

11:29.425 --> 11:30.925
this is not great.

11:30.927 --> 11:33.067
You haven't packed at all.

11:33.102 --> 11:36.811
You're moving out, and this
closet is still full of junk.

11:37.927 --> 11:38.999
(sighs): Oh.

11:39.024 --> 11:42.926
You know I need this whole room
for my in-home daycare business.

11:42.928 --> 11:44.428
This is the toddler room.

11:44.430 --> 11:46.630
The muralist is coming on Monday.

11:46.632 --> 11:48.899
(sighs) She's painting a wonderful

11:48.901 --> 11:50.534
dolphin scene.

11:50.536 --> 11:52.169
Dolphins? Are you kidding?!

11:52.171 --> 11:55.205
You never let me have a dolphin
mural, and I love dolphins.

11:55.207 --> 11:56.618
They're the princes of the sea.

11:56.643 --> 11:59.011
When I was a toddler, I just had walls.

12:00.145 --> 12:02.009
Why are you making me move?

12:02.191 --> 12:03.924
I don't want to move.

12:03.949 --> 12:06.883
But I need this room,
sweetheart. You know that.

12:06.885 --> 12:08.485
And it will be so fun

12:08.487 --> 12:10.552
living with Hector and his mother.

12:10.823 --> 12:12.856
She lives near Souplantation.

12:12.858 --> 12:15.025
You love Souplantation.

12:15.027 --> 12:17.088
I'm just going through a tough time.

12:17.510 --> 12:18.762
Too much change.

12:18.764 --> 12:20.864
I'm still on probation with Aloha,

12:20.866 --> 12:23.172
I had to quit Home Base
after my zit explosion.

12:23.197 --> 12:24.468
And I went through

12:24.470 --> 12:26.236
this really intense thing with Rebecca,

12:26.238 --> 12:29.782
who, come to find out,
never really cared about me.

12:30.276 --> 12:32.009
I'm in a lot of flux.

12:33.265 --> 12:34.845
(whining): Flux!

12:34.847 --> 12:36.546
Josh, please.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.968
Just pack the closet, my sweetheart.

12:38.993 --> 12:41.585
(sighs)

12:43.776 --> 12:45.289
REBECCA: I think I can really

12:45.291 --> 12:47.124
bring Nathaniel and
his dad closer together.

12:47.126 --> 12:49.459
You know, bridge the
gap between them, and

12:49.461 --> 12:51.461
I have such a great plan for doing that.

12:51.486 --> 12:54.364
- Hmm. I wonder about that.
- What?

12:54.366 --> 12:55.855
It feels like you're putting
yourself out there again.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.701
No, I'm being very mindful,
like we talked about.

12:57.703 --> 12:59.486
And I'm using the exact tools

12:59.511 --> 13:01.071
that we have all learned here

13:01.073 --> 13:02.980
in group therapy with my friends,

13:03.005 --> 13:06.410
Lana and Clarice and Bert

13:06.412 --> 13:08.745
- and Jo... illson.
- Rick.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.609
My name is Rick. I tell you every week.

13:10.634 --> 13:11.546
You full-on forgot his name.

13:11.571 --> 13:13.150
Yes, I did, but Rick,

13:13.152 --> 13:14.651
I mean, doesn't even know my name,

13:14.653 --> 13:16.063
and he barely shows an interest in me.

13:16.088 --> 13:17.727
If you ask me, your over-involvement

13:17.752 --> 13:20.594
in your dude's life is very
problematic, Rebecca Nora Bunch.

13:20.619 --> 13:22.025
- Oh...
- (laughs)

13:22.027 --> 13:24.628
- BERT: Snap.
- Didn't you tell us other stories

13:24.630 --> 13:26.330
about you trying to run into people?

13:26.332 --> 13:29.482
If you ask me, the whole
thing sounds very “O”"

13:29.601 --> 13:30.514
“O”?

13:30.539 --> 13:32.806
Oh. No, Lana, it's not O-bsessive.

13:32.831 --> 13:35.977
I agree with L. Seems “O.” B-T O.

13:36.002 --> 13:39.086
Can we just use real words?
Is that so much to ask?

13:39.111 --> 13:40.008
BERT: Listen, Rebecca,

13:40.033 --> 13:42.412
I know how easy it is to get obsessed.

13:42.414 --> 13:44.181
I also get intense about stuff.

13:44.183 --> 13:45.582
I get very maniacally

13:45.584 --> 13:47.584
fixated on things, and
that's why they thought

13:47.586 --> 13:49.152
that I was a paranoid schizophrenic,

13:49.154 --> 13:50.554
but they were obviously wrong.

13:50.556 --> 13:51.755
I am borderline,

13:51.757 --> 13:54.057
and that's why I can't
trust them or anyone else,

13:54.059 --> 13:55.176
because they're all out to get me!

13:55.201 --> 13:57.895
Bert, hey, hi. Look at
me. Let's take a breath.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.560
Were you saying that to him or me?
'Cause you were looking right at me.

14:00.562 --> 14:02.423
I don't need to take a breath.
Bert does,

14:02.439 --> 14:05.163
- and Rebecca definitely does.
- How dare you.

14:05.188 --> 14:08.406
I think we all need
to take a deep breath.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.178
(all inhaling deeply)

14:10.180 --> 14:12.660
(all exhaling)

14:13.402 --> 14:15.168
SHIN: That feels better.

14:15.426 --> 14:17.726
- Lana didn't breathe.
- You can't make me.

14:18.098 --> 14:19.728
Okay, everyone,

14:19.730 --> 14:21.530
I hear you. I appreciate
everyone's advice,

14:21.532 --> 14:23.499
and I am being present and taking it in.

14:23.501 --> 14:24.733
And Lana, it's true, okay?

14:24.735 --> 14:27.202
I did spy on people in the
past, and it was unhealthy,

14:27.204 --> 14:28.470
but this time, it's not that.

14:28.472 --> 14:29.571
I'm doing something nice

14:29.573 --> 14:31.517
for someone that I care about.

14:31.767 --> 14:33.809
Which is okay, right, Dr. Shin?

14:33.811 --> 14:35.644
Doing nice things is fine.

14:35.646 --> 14:38.859
Overextending yourself because
you're idealizing someone

14:38.884 --> 14:40.548
is what I want you to keep an eye on.

14:40.573 --> 14:43.587
Okay. Okay, my eyes are
on that. My eyes are on me.

14:46.157 --> 14:47.298
Ah.

14:47.323 --> 14:50.426
Well, hello, number 456H76.

14:50.428 --> 14:52.580
(Paula laughs)

14:52.830 --> 14:55.564
Oh, it's too easy.

14:57.673 --> 14:58.634
Hi.

14:59.096 --> 15:01.497
I'm Paula. Do you have a second?

15:05.242 --> 15:07.392
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

15:08.705 --> 15:10.045
Oh, excuse me, Miss,

15:10.047 --> 15:11.739
do you have any magazines
with men in them?

15:11.764 --> 15:13.942
Sure. I'm so sorry.

15:15.739 --> 15:17.353
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.

15:17.355 --> 15:19.488
I... I'd like to hang onto 'em both.

15:19.490 --> 15:22.591
Oh, of course. Whatever brings
all your boys to the yard.

15:22.593 --> 15:24.067
Oh, thank you.

15:24.092 --> 15:26.128
That is really
professional of you to say.

15:26.130 --> 15:28.130
(laughs)

15:29.262 --> 15:30.504
GEORGE: What am I doing here?

15:30.529 --> 15:32.568
I got you his schedule.
I want out of this scam.

15:32.570 --> 15:34.903
Well, sorry, but you're
my driver and my wingman

15:34.905 --> 15:36.805
and co-conspirator and my
suicide prevention buddy.

15:36.807 --> 15:38.941
What don't you understand
about this relationship?

15:39.231 --> 15:40.309
Put on these pants.

15:40.311 --> 15:41.710
Just do it here right now.

15:41.712 --> 15:43.278
Well, I can go to the bathroom.

15:43.280 --> 15:44.213
There's no time, and don't worry.

15:44.215 --> 15:45.280
I know what you got down there.

15:45.282 --> 15:46.482
I've seen plenty of them in my day.

15:46.484 --> 15:48.250
Well, I'm-I'm wearing
underwear, so you wouldn't...

15:48.252 --> 15:50.052
- Just put on the damn pants!
- Okay. Oh, well, no!

15:50.054 --> 15:51.820
What are we doing?
Where are we even going?

15:51.822 --> 15:54.823
I'm so sad I don't have the
ability to fire you right now.

15:54.825 --> 15:56.570
Tell me, or I'm out.

15:56.595 --> 15:58.961
Oh, really? 'Cause boop,
boop, glug, glug, glug.

15:58.963 --> 16:01.830
- “It was George. George made me do it”
- Then I'll do it, I'll do it.

16:04.572 --> 16:05.434
REBECCA: Okay.

16:05.436 --> 16:07.169
So, Nathaniel Sr. Will
be here any second,

16:07.171 --> 16:08.869
and when he gets here,
I am going to walk over

16:08.894 --> 16:11.240
and just casually strike up
a conversation about golf.

16:11.242 --> 16:13.342
I stayed up all night watching
old Masters Tournaments,

16:13.367 --> 16:14.610
yeah, memorizing stats.

16:14.612 --> 16:16.812
Oh, here's one. For
instance, did you know

16:16.814 --> 16:18.947
that Arnold Palmer won 92 tournaments,

16:18.949 --> 16:20.549
and is not just a beverage?

16:20.551 --> 16:21.984
- (car door opens)
- Oh, there he is. There he is.

16:21.986 --> 16:23.185
Okay.

16:23.187 --> 16:24.553
Enjoy.

16:24.555 --> 16:27.057
REBECCA: Okay, he's not
really dressed for golf, but...

16:27.059 --> 16:29.301
All right, so we're
just gonna walk up to him

16:29.326 --> 16:30.859
and be like, “Oh, I think

16:30.861 --> 16:32.161
“you're Nathaniel Plimpton, Sr.

16:32.163 --> 16:34.263
I'm kind of dating
your son.” All right.

16:34.265 --> 16:35.864
Come on. Oh.

16:35.866 --> 16:37.299
Oh.

16:37.301 --> 16:39.368
Wait. He's walking the wrong way.

16:39.370 --> 16:42.070
What? Where is he going?

16:42.072 --> 16:44.706
Ooh. Hmm?

16:47.445 --> 16:49.878
- Who the hell is that?
-(car door closes)

16:49.880 --> 16:52.448
Where is Nathaniel Sr. going?

16:52.450 --> 16:54.286
I don't know.

16:54.585 --> 16:57.352
It could be a drug deal or an affair.

16:57.354 --> 16:59.208
Probably ride-sharing app.

16:59.857 --> 17:01.590
All right, well, come
on. Let's follow him.

17:01.592 --> 17:02.724
What now?

17:02.726 --> 17:04.586
Well, if something weird is going on,

17:04.611 --> 17:06.060
I have to get to the bottom of it.

17:06.063 --> 17:07.796
I owe it to Nathaniel, so, let's go.

17:07.798 --> 17:10.265
(sighing): Oh.

17:10.267 --> 17:12.667
(sucks in through teeth)

17:12.670 --> 17:15.137
(sighs)

17:15.178 --> 17:17.627
Good-bye, baseball I
caught at Dodger Stadium.

17:19.376 --> 17:22.144
Good-bye, volleyball I
caught at Redondo Beach.

17:22.146 --> 17:24.146
(sniffs)

17:24.147 --> 17:26.882
Oh. Good-bye, tissue
from the cold I caught

17:26.884 --> 17:28.884
from the hot girl in algebra class.

17:28.886 --> 17:30.405
(laughing)

17:35.326 --> 17:38.061
Oh, man! Oh!

17:38.362 --> 17:39.905
(laughs)

17:39.930 --> 17:42.764
Oh! I can't throw this out.

17:42.766 --> 17:45.522
This has all my favorite
karaoke tracks on it.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.372
What? The batteries still work.

17:50.374 --> 17:52.441
(laughs)

17:52.443 --> 17:54.042
(whirring)

17:54.044 --> 17:56.512
- (chiming)
- “First Love!”

17:56.514 --> 17:58.847
Love this song.

18:01.244 --> 18:03.767
(echoes): Hello. Check, one, two, three.

18:04.288 --> 18:06.588
- Oh.

18:10.991 --> 18:15.294

18:20.271 --> 18:24.273

18:24.275 --> 18:26.308
You don't know me, but I
have a confession to make.

18:26.310 --> 18:28.076
Does it have anything
to do with the fact

18:28.078 --> 18:29.945
- that you've been stalking me?
- What?

18:29.947 --> 18:33.215
I've seen you skulking around
the park for the past hour.

18:33.217 --> 18:36.018
I'm flattered, but I'm into men. Sorry.

18:36.020 --> 18:38.118
Oh, no, no, no. No, no. I...

18:38.389 --> 18:40.289
I have to talk to you urgently.

18:40.291 --> 18:43.132
So what is up with you taking
your eggs off the donor site?

18:43.157 --> 18:44.459
I have a dear friend who really, really,

18:44.461 --> 18:46.929
really wants to make
a baby with those eggs.

18:46.931 --> 18:50.409
Okay, so this is not
appropriate or legal.

18:50.434 --> 18:53.128
So I'm just gonna reach for
my phone and call the police.

18:53.153 --> 18:55.203
Oh, no, no, no! What do
you want? What do you want?

18:55.205 --> 18:58.355
Ooh! How about store credit
at an off-price retailer?

18:58.380 --> 19:00.059
I just returned a tom-tom thingie

19:00.084 --> 19:01.466
that you can kind of sit on.

19:01.509 --> 19:03.673
Okay, look, this is
none of your business,

19:03.728 --> 19:05.433
and I'm sorry for your friend,

19:05.458 --> 19:08.031
but I'm not donating anymore.

19:08.033 --> 19:12.214
I graduated, and I'm getting
married, and I'm moving on.

19:12.239 --> 19:14.570
But your picture is still there,
and we fell in love with you.

19:14.572 --> 19:16.159
And-and you already donated the egg!

19:16.184 --> 19:17.761
I mean, it's just sitting there on ice.

19:17.775 --> 19:19.875
All-all you have to
do is sign a release.

19:19.877 --> 19:22.375
Please, please, please
let us have the last one.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.899
He needs it.

19:24.808 --> 19:26.508
Oh!

19:26.917 --> 19:29.117
(groans)

19:29.119 --> 19:31.149
Mm!

19:31.622 --> 19:33.989
Oh, my God, I am so nervous.

19:33.991 --> 19:35.924
What if my swimmers are no good?

19:35.926 --> 19:37.763
What if I can never again climb

19:37.788 --> 19:39.954
the sacred mountain of fatherhood?

19:40.417 --> 19:42.718
Are you, like, even listening?

19:43.917 --> 19:45.799
I got the yank bank on the horn.

19:45.824 --> 19:47.536
- Oh, God.
- They're on line four.

19:47.942 --> 19:49.371
Give 'em your cell, would ya?

19:49.373 --> 19:51.006
I don't like to vomit at work.

19:51.421 --> 19:53.421
Thanks for the update.

19:55.347 --> 19:56.490
This is Mr. Whitefeather.

19:57.028 --> 19:58.359

19:58.598 --> 19:59.792
Yes?

19:59.817 --> 20:02.104
Oh, is it bad? Are they slow?

20:02.129 --> 20:04.186
Are they dead? Were there any?

20:04.304 --> 20:05.730

REBECCA: Well, they look very cozy.

21:55.197 --> 21:57.330
Think we can rule out ride-share.

21:57.355 --> 21:58.688
Not necessarily.

21:58.690 --> 22:00.323
You know, I've actually
had some of my best dates

22:00.325 --> 22:01.370
when I was paying by the mile.

22:01.395 --> 22:03.526
Ugh, geez, I need a new sidekick.

22:03.528 --> 22:04.594
You make me so sad.

22:04.596 --> 22:06.195
(quietly): Okay.

22:06.197 --> 22:08.144
Okay, who is that?

22:08.169 --> 22:09.679
Wow, that girl looks young
enough to be his daughter.

22:09.732 --> 22:11.331
Hey, old man.

22:13.538 --> 22:14.675
She is his daughter.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.749
That's his mistress
and that's his daughter.

22:16.774 --> 22:18.941
Oh, my God. I mean, this is...

22:19.148 --> 22:21.982
I just uncovered years
of-of-of family secrets

22:21.984 --> 22:24.518
and pent-up anger
and-and-and secrets.

22:24.520 --> 22:25.485
Did I say secrets?

22:25.487 --> 22:27.020
I think I said secrets. I mean,

22:27.022 --> 22:28.655
this is way better than
the little bits of love

22:28.657 --> 22:31.491
I was gonna have to try to wring
out of his dried-up old dad.

22:31.493 --> 22:33.393
This is something so much better.

22:33.395 --> 22:37.423
I-I-I got him a nice, juicy,
wonderful, little sister.

22:37.933 --> 22:40.433
Ah, I'm amazing.

22:40.435 --> 22:43.236
I... no, I don't think
you're seeing this

22:43.238 --> 22:45.238
the way people are gonna see it.

22:45.240 --> 22:48.071
MRS. HERNANDEZ: You have to
tell Darryl the donor said no.

22:48.103 --> 22:49.369
I will get to it.

22:49.371 --> 22:51.638
Will you ease up already, Fonzie?

22:51.663 --> 22:53.172
Topical reference. Good one.

22:53.174 --> 22:54.173
PAULA: Good night.

22:54.339 --> 22:56.327
- MRS. HERNANDEZ: Later.
- PAULA: See you.

22:57.967 --> 22:59.712
Number 456H76.

23:00.064 --> 23:01.272
What are you doing here?

23:01.297 --> 23:02.656
I thought about it.

23:03.586 --> 23:05.553
- I'll do it.
- (gasps) I'll call the bank

23:05.578 --> 23:08.321
- and tell them to release my last egg.
- Oh, thank God!

23:08.323 --> 23:09.514
There's just one thing I want

23:09.538 --> 23:10.785
- which is to...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

23:10.810 --> 23:12.301
We can talk about details
later, but right now,

23:12.326 --> 23:14.502
I am gonna run upstairs
and tell Darryl it is on.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.427
Thank you! Thank you so much!

23:22.604 --> 23:24.270
Mmm.

23:27.649 --> 23:28.686
Mmm.

23:29.131 --> 23:31.904
It is so cute how you do that.

23:32.108 --> 23:34.408
- Eat food?
- Yes.

23:34.410 --> 23:36.210
Mm.

23:37.447 --> 23:40.781
You know, I keep thinking
about the sad thing

23:40.783 --> 23:42.483
that we were talking
about the other day,

23:42.485 --> 23:44.285
about how you were lonely as a kid.

23:44.287 --> 23:46.620
I just keep picturing
you in footie pajamas,

23:46.622 --> 23:49.190
- sitting on Santa's lap...
- (chuckles)

23:49.192 --> 23:52.226
being all sad and lonely.

23:52.525 --> 23:54.399
But when you were
sitting on Santa's lap,

23:54.424 --> 23:56.564
like, what did you wish for?

23:56.566 --> 24:00.301
- Did you ask for a puppy or a kitty...
- Hmm.

24:00.338 --> 24:01.846
Or a little brother or sister?

24:01.871 --> 24:03.738
- That's what you asked for, right?
- Uh, no.

24:03.740 --> 24:05.673
I mostly asked for treasury bonds.

24:05.675 --> 24:11.018
Okay. But, but if you had had
a little brother or sister,

24:11.096 --> 24:13.014
that would've made you so happy, right?

24:13.588 --> 24:15.716
Yeah, I guess.

24:15.776 --> 24:18.386
- Hmm, might've been fun.
- Yeah?

24:18.440 --> 24:21.522
- Let me get these out of the way.

28:02.999 --> 28:04.583
hand-sanitizing constantly

28:04.608 --> 28:07.662
and never bringing uncut
grapes to the office again.

28:07.687 --> 28:10.588
There's gonna be a baby in here.

28:10.590 --> 28:11.889
(giggles)

28:11.891 --> 28:13.858
My God, tell me everything.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.593
Oh, Paula, I am so excited.

28:15.595 --> 28:17.361
They're putting my hot sauce
on the eggs this morning,

28:17.363 --> 28:19.563
and the surrogate is on call

28:19.565 --> 28:21.365
and as soon as the
embryo starts to divide,

28:21.367 --> 28:22.667
they can implant it.

28:22.669 --> 28:25.002
(laughs): Oh, that's so great.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.971
(phone chimes)

28:28.341 --> 28:29.740
Would you excuse me for a minute?

28:29.742 --> 28:32.009
- Sure.
- Okay.

28:34.202 --> 28:35.246
Hi.

28:35.248 --> 28:36.414
What's this text about money?

28:36.416 --> 28:37.548
He already paid you.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.316
Yeah, but not enough.

28:39.318 --> 28:41.185
You left before I could
finish the other day.

28:41.187 --> 28:43.220
Yes, I gave you my egg,

28:43.222 --> 28:44.622
but I had terms.

28:44.624 --> 28:46.857
You see, the way you approached
me was a bit unorthodox

28:46.859 --> 28:48.392
and I would hate for
the police to find out

28:48.394 --> 28:51.429
that you violated my
anonymity and stalked me.

28:51.431 --> 28:52.930
That would be a bummer.

28:52.932 --> 28:54.165
- What?
- So, I'd like to be paid

28:54.167 --> 28:55.199
in monthly installments

28:55.201 --> 28:56.600
for the rest of the baby's life.

28:56.602 --> 28:57.802
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

28:57.804 --> 28:59.470
(laughs): Wait.

28:59.472 --> 29:01.238
You're blackmailing me?!

29:01.703 --> 29:03.418
And you're a smoker.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.643
Yeah.

29:05.645 --> 29:07.311
But you checked “no smoking.”

29:07.313 --> 29:08.726
Yeah.

29:09.082 --> 29:10.981
Oh, my God, you're a horrible person.

29:11.385 --> 29:14.268
I can't believe I picked
you out of a catalog.

29:14.787 --> 29:17.154
If you were a sweater,
I would send you back,

29:17.156 --> 29:18.489
or at least put you in
the front hall closet

29:18.491 --> 29:21.358
for six months while I
intend to send you back.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.027
Whatever. You're stuck with me.

29:23.029 --> 29:25.650
Your friend's making a
baby with me right now.

29:25.947 --> 29:27.580
No. Not on my watch.

29:27.582 --> 29:30.812
I am, I am stopping this right now.

29:30.837 --> 29:33.604
WOMAN: Thank you for calling the
San Fernando Egg Donor Center.

29:33.606 --> 29:35.639
Hi. Stop. Hold the baby presses.

29:35.641 --> 29:38.067
Just-just don't fertilize.
Don't do it. Just keep

29:38.092 --> 29:39.810
- the huevos out of the rancheros.
- We're closed for the day.

29:39.812 --> 29:41.378
Hello? Hello? Please
leave your name and number

29:41.380 --> 29:43.614
after the beep and we will get
back to you... Wait. H... no.

29:43.616 --> 29:46.317
During our normal business
hours. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.013
So what are we doing here?

29:52.038 --> 29:54.326
Why are we meeting a client in his dump?

29:54.351 --> 29:56.360
I am so sorry. I lied to you.

29:56.362 --> 29:58.496
There is no client. She made me do it.

29:58.498 --> 30:00.498
I tried to stop her, but I-I couldn't.

30:00.500 --> 30:02.466
It's Rebecca. She is a train

30:02.468 --> 30:03.834
and you can't get off. And you're trying

30:03.836 --> 30:05.302
to pull the brake, but
the next thing you know,

30:05.304 --> 30:06.537
you're shoveling more
coal into the engine.

30:06.539 --> 30:07.805
I don't know how trains work.

30:07.807 --> 30:10.141
I am so sorry that I hit your car.

30:10.143 --> 30:12.610
Uh, but a dozen donuts is
the least that I can do.

30:12.612 --> 30:14.044
Ugh, I don't want a dozen donuts.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.579
I want your insurance information.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.548
I've been asking you for
that for half an hour.

30:17.962 --> 30:19.250
Rebecca.

30:19.744 --> 30:21.564
What's-what's happening here?

30:21.566 --> 30:22.864
A surprise.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.439
An impish ruse, but
for the best of reasons.

30:24.464 --> 30:26.791
Wait, what's going on here?

30:26.793 --> 30:28.759
Did you hit my car on purpose?

30:28.761 --> 30:29.798
NATHANIEL: Hold on.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.172
Y-You hit her car?

30:31.197 --> 30:32.830
Yes, yes, yes, but for
all the right reasons.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.999
Nathaniel... (sighs)

30:35.094 --> 30:36.627
meet your sister.

30:43.290 --> 30:45.702
That's right, Nathaniel.
This is your sister,

30:45.727 --> 30:47.890
sired by your father
and his secret whore.

30:47.915 --> 30:49.581
I know this would be a shock at first.

30:49.583 --> 30:54.152
WOMAN: Whoa, whoa.
Whore? And... sister?

30:54.154 --> 30:55.487
What's happening?

30:55.489 --> 30:57.155
And Nathaniel, what
are you even doing here?

30:57.157 --> 30:58.156
You don't eat donuts.

30:58.158 --> 30:59.825
Uh... (stammers) Sorry, you know him?

30:59.850 --> 31:02.127
- You know your secret sibling?
- Okay, so, I'm gonna run away.

31:02.129 --> 31:03.670
- You're not going anywhere.
- Yeah.

31:03.710 --> 31:05.069
But how do you two know each other?

31:05.085 --> 31:08.412
Her mom was my dad's
secretary for years, Janice.

31:08.437 --> 31:10.370
Okay, right, and
they're having an affair.

31:10.654 --> 31:14.247
WOMAN (laughs): No. My mom worked
for Mr. P. Sr. for 30 years,

31:14.272 --> 31:16.472
so he pays for my tuition
and once in a while,

31:16.474 --> 31:17.706
we invite him over to lunch.

31:17.708 --> 31:19.241
Wait... (stammers) why all the secrecy?

31:19.243 --> 31:20.676
Why does he pretend to play golf?

31:20.678 --> 31:22.244
He has 150 employees.

31:22.246 --> 31:24.234
You think he wants to
pay hundreds of tuitions?

31:24.640 --> 31:25.695
Wait a minute.

31:25.697 --> 31:28.194
How do you know he
pretends to play golf?

31:28.219 --> 31:31.020
Um, uh...

31:32.187 --> 31:34.172
Okay, I think we need to have a talk.

31:37.528 --> 31:39.561
(sighs)

31:40.035 --> 31:44.400
Oh... you did it, honey.

31:44.402 --> 31:46.001
Don't you feel so much better?

31:46.026 --> 31:47.840
No, I feel terrible.

31:48.205 --> 31:50.539
And you're being so mean lately.

31:51.233 --> 31:54.710
Joshy, what's really going on with you?

31:55.546 --> 31:57.313
I don't know.

31:57.315 --> 32:00.149
My whole life, I-I knew
what I was gonna do,

32:00.151 --> 32:01.518
who I was gonna be.

32:02.453 --> 32:04.687
Get a comfortable job, marry Valencia,

32:04.689 --> 32:06.522
see you guys every weekend,

32:06.524 --> 32:07.690
coach Little League,

32:07.692 --> 32:10.059
go to church, hang out with my friends,

32:10.061 --> 32:11.560
own a shave ice machine...

32:11.562 --> 32:14.712
(sighs) But none of
it makes sense anymore.

32:15.513 --> 32:16.976
I don't want those things now.

32:17.001 --> 32:19.294
I know, growing up is hard.

32:19.319 --> 32:22.180
I've been trying to remember
when it stopped making sense.

32:22.516 --> 32:24.573
I... I moved back from New York,

32:24.575 --> 32:25.774
I tried to settle back in,

32:25.776 --> 32:27.776
but things were not right
between me and Valencia

32:27.778 --> 32:29.812
because I started
spending time with Rebecca.

32:29.814 --> 32:31.547
And that job at Aloha,

32:31.549 --> 32:34.603
Rebecca also got for me
because she believed in me.

32:35.173 --> 32:39.621
And then V and I split up,
also because of Rebecca.

32:40.433 --> 32:41.892
When you think about it,

32:42.506 --> 32:44.639
Rebecca's everywhere.

32:48.466 --> 32:50.364
She changed me.

32:51.895 --> 32:54.470
Made me think my life
could be different.

32:54.472 --> 32:55.817
I could be special.

33:00.177 --> 33:02.718
My God, she ruined me.

33:03.447 --> 33:05.047
I spent my whole life in flip-flops

33:05.049 --> 33:07.116
and she made me want closed-toed shoes.

33:07.752 --> 33:09.685
I can't go back to my old life.

33:09.687 --> 33:11.457
I-I got to find a new life!

33:11.694 --> 33:12.760
(snoring)

33:12.957 --> 33:15.024
- Hey, Mom!
- (snorts) Oh.

33:15.026 --> 33:16.658
Sorry.

33:16.660 --> 33:19.028
Those are not real problems.

33:19.030 --> 33:20.562
(scoffs)

33:20.564 --> 33:21.730
God, I hope it's a girl.

33:21.732 --> 33:24.893
I want to name her Daphnila or Sefarine.

33:24.987 --> 33:26.579
Yeah, not names.

33:26.604 --> 33:27.736
What's the matter with you?

33:28.585 --> 33:30.785
Why aren't you more excited?

33:31.108 --> 33:32.987
This baby was Frankensteined by you.

33:33.012 --> 33:34.243
Yeah, no, it is.

33:34.245 --> 33:36.179
I-I-I know. (scoffs)

33:36.204 --> 33:37.403
What?

33:37.548 --> 33:38.624
What's wrong?

33:39.710 --> 33:41.383
There are a couple of little details

33:41.385 --> 33:44.386
that I neglected to tell you.

33:44.388 --> 33:46.588
- (phone rings)
- Oh. Oh.

33:46.945 --> 33:47.756
Yes?

33:47.758 --> 33:49.525
Hello, Dr. Ellerbe.

33:49.590 --> 33:50.922
Yes?

33:52.484 --> 33:53.729
Yes!

33:53.731 --> 33:55.397
I'm gonna be a daddy?!

33:55.399 --> 33:57.492
Oh, God, no.

33:57.517 --> 33:59.234
Oh, the fertilization didn't take.

33:59.236 --> 34:00.936
Thank God!

34:00.938 --> 34:01.837
What? It didn't work?

34:01.839 --> 34:02.971
But... Oh, no, no, no.

34:02.973 --> 34:06.675
Darryl, number 456H76
was a blackmailing,

34:06.677 --> 34:08.110
secret smoking bitch.

34:08.112 --> 34:09.911
And I know that because
I tracked her down

34:09.914 --> 34:11.947
and I gave her all
this blackmail leverage.

34:11.949 --> 34:13.849
And I can't believe I did that.

34:13.851 --> 34:15.851
Oh, God, I'm so out of practice.

34:15.853 --> 34:16.952
So sloppy.

34:16.954 --> 34:18.320
♪ ♪

34:18.619 --> 34:20.386
So nothing happened?

34:22.297 --> 34:23.871
There's no baby?

34:26.170 --> 34:28.081
Oh, no, honey.

34:30.768 --> 34:32.301
Not this time.

34:32.918 --> 34:35.437
But this is a good thing.

34:35.438 --> 34:37.239
I promise. And next time,

34:37.241 --> 34:39.675
we're gonna get somebody so much better.

34:39.677 --> 34:41.202
Yeah.

34:41.627 --> 34:43.525
Okay, in another year.

34:44.614 --> 34:46.389
A year?

34:46.414 --> 34:49.318
Paula, it is really
expensive to buy those huevos.

34:49.616 --> 34:52.083
I can only do it, like, once a year.

34:52.623 --> 34:54.208
Oh, my God.

34:58.762 --> 35:00.714
(softly): I'm so sorry.

35:01.132 --> 35:04.933
(sighs) Oh...

35:05.262 --> 35:06.929
(sighs)

35:08.612 --> 35:11.198
I have to stop interfering
in people's lives.

35:12.659 --> 35:14.753
I do it when I'm unhappy,
I do it when I'm happy,

35:14.778 --> 35:18.222
and either way, it never works out.

35:18.649 --> 35:20.115
Uh, doy.

35:20.117 --> 35:21.816
I deserve that.

35:33.097 --> 35:34.496
So...

35:34.498 --> 35:36.785
you said you wanted to talk,
but you haven't said anything.

35:38.681 --> 35:39.613
(clears throat)

35:39.638 --> 35:41.436
- I'm still processing.
- Okay.

35:41.438 --> 35:42.437
Okay, that's healthy.

35:42.439 --> 35:43.906
Um...

35:44.402 --> 35:47.732
I will just, uh, I'll wait here

35:47.855 --> 35:49.616
and eat until you're ready.

35:50.898 --> 35:53.165
- Thank you.
- Great.

35:54.777 --> 35:56.944
(huffs under breath)

35:58.155 --> 35:59.521
Oh, God, just tell me.

35:59.523 --> 36:00.802
Do you forgive me?

36:01.123 --> 36:01.989
Are you gonna forgive me?

36:02.014 --> 36:03.762
Please don't break up with me.

36:08.318 --> 36:10.598
Just tell me, okay? Just
rip the Band-Aid off.

36:10.623 --> 36:12.153
Are you gonna break up with
me? You're breaking up with me.

36:12.178 --> 36:13.832
But are you? Are you
gonna break up with me?

36:13.857 --> 36:15.957
Rebecca, what you did was absolutely...

36:15.959 --> 36:17.058
It was over the top.

36:17.060 --> 36:18.760
Inexcusable. I-I know.

36:18.762 --> 36:19.669
But...

36:20.797 --> 36:22.044
you were trying to help.

36:22.092 --> 36:25.279
Yes. Yes, I was, I really was.

36:25.304 --> 36:29.013
The thing is, you and
I are really... different.

36:33.637 --> 36:35.363
But that's part of
what I like about you.

36:37.007 --> 36:39.949
And I feel closer to you than
I have to basically anyone.

36:40.177 --> 36:44.780
You make me feel like I could
be a different... kind of person,

36:44.805 --> 36:46.925
a person who expresses their feelings

36:46.950 --> 36:50.385
and-and cries at movies and...

36:50.387 --> 36:52.421
makes eye contact with homeless people.

36:53.328 --> 36:55.151
So you're gonna forgive me?

36:56.386 --> 36:57.451
Yeah, I think I will.

36:57.594 --> 37:00.495
- (exhales)
- But you have to promise...

37:00.497 --> 37:02.503
never to do anything
like that ever again.

37:02.528 --> 37:03.839
I promise.

37:04.442 --> 37:05.741
I swear.

37:06.103 --> 37:07.436
Come here.

37:09.339 --> 37:10.549
This table's really long.
I'm just gonna...

37:10.574 --> 37:11.259
Very long.

37:11.284 --> 37:12.507
I'm just gonna come
over there. Come on over.

37:12.509 --> 37:14.109
I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna

37:14.111 --> 37:15.277
scoot over here.

37:15.279 --> 37:16.318
Oh, hi.

37:17.247 --> 37:18.904
REBECCA: Whew! So...

37:18.929 --> 37:20.615
whew! I got away with it. (laughs)

37:20.617 --> 37:22.551
- Mm-hmm.
- That was the wrong choice of words.

37:22.553 --> 37:23.618
I mean, we worked it out.

37:23.620 --> 37:24.586
Mm-hmm.

37:24.588 --> 37:25.451
Okay, I hear you.

37:25.453 --> 37:27.266
And what I did was not the best idea.

37:27.291 --> 37:28.256
Mm-hmm.

37:28.258 --> 37:29.524
But it came from caring and affection.

37:29.526 --> 37:30.759
It wasn't about obsession.

37:30.761 --> 37:31.993
No, what I did

37:31.995 --> 37:33.662
was selfless and kind. It was too kind.

37:33.664 --> 37:36.331
- Rebecca...
- I like this guy, okay?

37:36.333 --> 37:38.600
I like him a lot.

37:38.679 --> 37:41.120
I like him so much and
I want to be with him.

37:41.754 --> 37:43.505
So, what, I can never
have a great relationship

37:43.507 --> 37:44.806
because I have borderline
personality disorder,

37:44.808 --> 37:46.007
is that what you're saying?

37:46.009 --> 37:47.042
Not at all.

37:47.044 --> 37:48.477
But doesn't it feel like

37:48.479 --> 37:50.011
you're repeating some old patterns?

37:50.164 --> 37:52.481
Your patterns with Josh, perhaps?

37:52.483 --> 37:53.882
Uh,
J-J-Josh?

37:53.884 --> 37:55.383
No, no, no. No, no, no.

37:55.385 --> 37:56.752
The way I am with Nathaniel

37:56.754 --> 37:58.787
is nothing like the way I was with Josh.

37:58.789 --> 38:00.155
I just want to make
Nathaniel a better person,

38:00.157 --> 38:01.189
and I want to make him

38:01.191 --> 38:02.357
happy all the time and I want

38:02.359 --> 38:03.692
to get to know everything about him

38:03.694 --> 38:05.393
and I want to get to
know everyone in his life

38:05.395 --> 38:06.895
and I want to have that feeling

38:06.897 --> 38:08.997
that you get when you
really get to know someone

38:08.999 --> 38:11.567
and it feels like glitter
is exploding inside of you.

38:12.069 --> 38:14.402
Ah... Oh...

38:14.404 --> 38:16.104
Mm-hmm.

38:18.879 --> 38:22.444
Okay. I've been thinking
about ways to raise money.

38:22.446 --> 38:24.446
Here they are, rapid-fire:
Bake sale, car wash,

38:24.448 --> 38:26.248
lap dances in the office... Here me out.

38:26.250 --> 38:27.616
Not a lot of people know this,

38:27.618 --> 38:29.885
but Mrs. Hernandez has a rack on her...

38:31.722 --> 38:33.021
What the hell happened in here?

38:33.023 --> 38:33.992
I sold it.

38:34.424 --> 38:35.824
I sold all of it.

38:35.826 --> 38:37.192
(gasps) Jackalope...

38:37.194 --> 38:38.860
I know. I know.

38:38.862 --> 38:40.756
People wanted to buy that junk?

38:40.781 --> 38:41.814
Most of it, no.

38:41.960 --> 38:43.675
I mean, I did have
one piece of turquoise

38:43.700 --> 38:44.866
that turned out to be real.

38:44.868 --> 38:46.001
(gasps) And then the rest

38:46.003 --> 38:48.203
I just sold to stupid hipsters

38:48.205 --> 38:49.738
at the Melrose flea market.

38:50.029 --> 38:53.060
I want to try again
right away; I don't want to wait.

38:53.085 --> 38:54.810
I am ready for this baby.

38:54.812 --> 38:56.278
Well, that's great, Darryl.

38:56.280 --> 38:58.480
And I promise, this time
I will stay out of it.

38:58.482 --> 38:59.748
Oh, no, please don't.

38:59.750 --> 39:01.124
Me and Tasmyline...

39:01.608 --> 39:03.151
we need you, Auntie Paula.

39:03.153 --> 39:05.854
Auntie Paula? Oh... (laughs)

39:05.856 --> 39:09.291
- Oh, I like the way that sounds.
- I know. Me, too.

39:09.293 --> 39:11.359
But I don't like the
way Tasmyline sounds,

39:11.361 --> 39:13.588
so that is a hard, hard no on that.

39:13.613 --> 39:15.007
What about Shatonka?

39:15.032 --> 39:15.764
Uh...

39:15.789 --> 39:18.356
It means “lady truck.”

39:19.713 --> 39:21.847
(birds singing)

39:26.643 --> 39:27.876
REBECCA: I ran into Josh.

39:27.878 --> 39:28.944
He made me feel warm inside,

39:28.946 --> 39:30.345
like glitter was exploding inside me.

39:30.347 --> 39:33.181
♪ ♪

39:47.304 --> 39:48.937
(knocking at door)

39:52.736 --> 39:53.935
Hey.

39:54.771 --> 39:56.357
Hey...

39:57.357 --> 39:59.107
Can I talk to you for a second?

39:59.109 --> 40:01.643
(exhales) Okay. Sure, come on in.

40:01.645 --> 40:04.246
I, um... (clears throat)

40:04.271 --> 40:06.310
uh, came over to see you because...

40:07.802 --> 40:09.284
there's something I never said.

40:09.286 --> 40:10.418
Oh, God, Josh...

40:10.420 --> 40:11.887
Look, if you're here to say sorry,

40:11.889 --> 40:13.054
there's really no need.

40:13.056 --> 40:14.823
Like... it's fine, stuff happens.

40:14.825 --> 40:16.708
No, not sorry.

40:17.728 --> 40:19.127
Thank you.

40:19.129 --> 40:21.326
Wh... What?

40:21.351 --> 40:23.943
Before I met you, I set the bar

40:23.968 --> 40:27.369
so low for myself.

40:27.470 --> 40:29.003
But you freed me from that.

40:29.763 --> 40:31.474
Whatever my future holds,

40:31.499 --> 40:34.109
it's different from
what I planned and...

40:34.793 --> 40:35.944
(sighs)

40:36.188 --> 40:38.255
that's because of you.

40:38.882 --> 40:40.123
Wow.

40:40.148 --> 40:44.506
Now I'm, uh, learning to
break out of my patterns.

40:45.789 --> 40:47.188
Well, Josh, thank you for coming here

40:47.190 --> 40:49.324
and saying all these things.

40:49.608 --> 40:51.036
This must have been hard.

40:51.061 --> 40:52.209
It was.

40:53.563 --> 40:56.164
And, um, you know, the truth is,

40:56.166 --> 40:58.133
I'm a bit of a coward.

40:58.464 --> 41:00.145
And I'm not great at
doing the hard thing,

41:00.170 --> 41:02.237
even when I know it's right.

41:03.144 --> 41:05.774
God, doing the right thing,
is there anything worse?

41:06.191 --> 41:06.994
But...

41:07.044 --> 41:08.230
(exhales loudly)

41:08.232 --> 41:10.222
there comes a time when...

41:10.247 --> 41:11.972
(clicks tongue) it's what you have to.

41:14.285 --> 41:17.452
Hey, Josh, not to be rude, but
there's something I need to do,

41:17.454 --> 41:19.820
so can you get your ass out of my house?

41:20.857 --> 41:22.057
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

41:22.036 --> 41:23.047
Thanks.

41:23.072 --> 41:24.477
(sighs)

41:26.104 --> 41:27.769
(knocking at door)

41:29.199 --> 41:31.441
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:36.659 --> 41:37.872
Rebecca, what's wrong?

41:38.100 --> 41:40.526
Nathaniel, I, uh...

41:40.890 --> 41:42.790
I have to do something
I've never done before.

41:43.714 --> 41:45.113
What?

41:45.115 --> 41:46.681
(clears throat, exhales)
