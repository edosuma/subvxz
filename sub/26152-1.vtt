WEBVTT

00:11.130 --> 00:14.050
-Albert:  Spain. Costa Del Sol.

00:14.090 --> 00:16.080
A fugitive's paradise.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.040
My old man had it   all figured out.

00:19.050 --> 00:21.130
"Drink beer,   tan like an orangutan's arse

00:21.140 --> 00:24.060
and consume all the paella   you can eat."

00:24.070 --> 00:26.070
That's always been   Vic Hill's view, anyway.

00:26.080 --> 00:29.110
Get the loot, get your people   out to the Costa,

00:29.120 --> 00:30.090
job done.

00:32.010 --> 00:34.040
And we almost   made it, too.

00:34.050 --> 00:36.030
-(gasping, panting)

00:36.040 --> 00:37.150
(coughing)

00:39.170 --> 00:40.140
-Man: What was that?

00:41.140 --> 00:43.030
-(shouting in foreign language)

00:43.040 --> 00:45.000
-(coughing)

00:45.010 --> 00:46.000
-Mum!

00:47.190 --> 00:49.090
-Oh!

00:49.100 --> 00:50.060
Lotti!

00:50.070 --> 00:51.220
-Lotti!

00:51.220 --> 00:52.220
-I'm here!

00:55.090 --> 00:56.060
Where's Charlie?

00:56.070 --> 00:57.060
-Charlie: It's okay!

00:58.060 --> 00:59.090
Hate 'Em's got me.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.060
(gasping)

01:02.070 --> 01:03.090
-You all right, son?

01:03.100 --> 01:04.200
-(man shouting in foreign language)

01:06.090 --> 01:07.080
-Dad?

01:09.020 --> 01:11.100
-Victor Hill, where the bloody hell are you?

01:11.110 --> 01:13.090
-I'm here! I'm over here, Lil.

01:13.100 --> 01:14.070
(coughing)

01:23.080 --> 01:24.220
-Albert: Who the hell were they?

01:24.230 --> 01:26.030
-It was too dark. I couldn't see.

01:26.040 --> 01:27.000
(screaming)

01:27.010 --> 01:29.120
-Is it gone? All of our money?

01:29.130 --> 01:31.050
-All of it, gone.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.180
All ten million.

01:33.190 --> 01:35.130
Ten million Euros and it's gone.

01:35.140 --> 01:36.190
-So close.

01:39.030 --> 01:41.010
Albert: It's us, we're idiots, this life of ours.

01:41.020 --> 01:42.060
Bullshit.

01:42.070 --> 01:43.120
-Charlie: It's only money, Al.

01:43.130 --> 01:45.080
Got it once before, we'll get it again.

01:45.090 --> 01:46.150
-Are you sure about that, Charlie?

01:54.080 --> 01:55.230
I mean, are any of you sure about that?

02:00.220 --> 02:03.080
(theme music playing)

02:38.000 --> 02:38.210
-Gentlemen.

02:40.110 --> 02:41.160
Today I would like to present you

02:41.170 --> 02:44.140
with a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity.

02:44.150 --> 02:47.130
To be part of something new, exciting, special.

02:48.220 --> 02:50.210
Now as you look around you, you may see nothing more

02:50.220 --> 02:53.000
than a rundown old bar, maybe.

02:54.020 --> 02:56.220
But what I ask of you is to call upon your imaginations.

02:56.230 --> 02:58.100
Cast your minds to the future,

02:59.100 --> 03:01.040
a future where The Bunker Bar isn't just

03:01.050 --> 03:04.030
one of the Costa del Sol's best destinations.

03:04.040 --> 03:07.110
No. But the only one worth going to.

03:09.100 --> 03:10.170
-Charlie: Where do I sign, Al?

03:10.180 --> 03:12.140
-Reckon? Reckon they'll go for it? I don't know.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.170
It just feels a bit like I'm flogging a timeshare in the 80s.

03:14.180 --> 03:16.120
-Just sell them on you, okay?

03:16.130 --> 03:18.000
People invest in the person and the passion

03:18.010 --> 03:19.040
even more than the idea.

03:19.050 --> 03:20.010
-Yeah.

03:20.020 --> 03:21.020
-Ice to Eskimos, Al.

03:22.040 --> 03:23.040
-Ice to Eskimos, Al.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.150
-You seen Billy today? -Not yet.

03:29.230 --> 03:32.080
Billy! Where are you?

03:32.090 --> 03:33.080
Billy?

03:35.210 --> 03:37.080
He didn't come home again last night.

03:37.090 --> 03:38.170
-Oh, probably out ravaging

03:38.180 --> 03:41.110
that temperamental Mediterranean goddess again.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.220
-Lucky sod. -He's not a lucky sod.

03:42.230 --> 03:45.040
He's miserable. He has been ever since Lotti dumped him.

03:45.050 --> 03:47.090
He's shagging everything with a pulse to get over her.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.200
And let's face it, you ain't much better

03:48.210 --> 03:50.070
since Chloe gave you the elbow, are you?

03:50.080 --> 03:51.230
-Please! I'm a 100 percent over Chloe.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.090
-Yeah. -(stammers)

03:53.100 --> 03:55.090
By the way, she did not give me the elbow.

03:55.100 --> 03:58.060
Jus-- just decided that, you know,

03:58.070 --> 03:59.140
a life on the lam was not for her.

03:59.150 --> 04:00.230
-Charlie, she jumped ship in Biarritz

04:01.000 --> 04:02.020
before we even got to Spain.

04:02.030 --> 04:04.010
Accept it, you were unceremoniously dumped.

04:04.020 --> 04:06.040
So stop walking around with that face like a pickled onion all day.

04:06.050 --> 04:07.130
-Yeah, no, no. At least I was brave enough

04:07.140 --> 04:09.070
to offer my heart to someone.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.050
The longest you've ever committed to anyone is 48 hours.

04:11.060 --> 04:12.170
-Have you seen Billy? -Not a peep.

04:14.030 --> 04:15.140
-And it was 24 hours.

04:15.150 --> 04:16.200
Let's run it again.

04:16.210 --> 04:18.050
Today, gentlemen, I'd like to present you

04:18.060 --> 04:20.010
with a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity...

04:20.020 --> 04:23.100
(shouting, indistinct)

04:25.110 --> 04:29.000
♪ You know someday   that we gonna part ♪

04:29.010 --> 04:32.040
♪ You know someday that   you're gonna break my heart ♪

04:32.050 --> 04:33.030
-Oh, yeah.

04:34.030 --> 04:36.180
I saw an advert for a lovely finca outside of town.

04:36.190 --> 04:38.180
Three hectares, a pool,

04:38.190 --> 04:41.000
nice garden to keep you busy, Lil.

04:41.010 --> 04:43.220
High up on the hill with an amazing view.

04:43.230 --> 04:45.060
Visibility for miles.

04:45.070 --> 04:48.020
-Visibility's not what we're seeking out at the moment, Vic.

04:50.150 --> 04:53.050
Look, I told you. I don't need a big house.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.180
I just need you.

04:54.190 --> 04:56.090
-And here I am, Lil.

04:56.100 --> 04:59.200
A reformed character, as directed.

04:59.210 --> 05:01.100
(chuckles)

05:01.110 --> 05:03.090
-We've been here for six months...

05:04.130 --> 05:06.060
without a hiccup.

05:06.070 --> 05:07.150
We can make this work.

05:09.090 --> 05:10.210
-Yes, my love.

05:10.220 --> 05:13.040
We can, and we will.

05:15.150 --> 05:17.020
I'm just gonna go and see Albert.

05:17.030 --> 05:18.070
See what's cooking.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.040
-Vic?

05:27.180 --> 05:30.030
Pick up some fish for lunch, would you?

05:30.040 --> 05:32.100
-Fish for lunch. Got it.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.150
-(grunting)

06:19.040 --> 06:21.200
Hey! Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here!

06:23.050 --> 06:24.130
-You tell 'em, Lottie.

06:25.070 --> 06:26.170
-Morning, Clarence. How are you today?

06:26.180 --> 06:27.140
-Mm.

06:29.050 --> 06:30.150
We can put a man on the moon,

06:30.160 --> 06:31.220
but we still haven't figured out

06:31.230 --> 06:33.180
how to prevent a hangover, Lottie.

06:33.190 --> 06:35.220
-Cafe solo then?

06:35.230 --> 06:37.070
Muchas gracias, chica.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.020
-Manny, Manny, Manny.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.010
-Octopus. -Nice.

06:46.020 --> 06:47.190
That's a nice octopus. Thank you.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.170
Did you get the other thing I asked for?

06:51.200 --> 06:54.030
-Si.  I, uh, I got it, Hate 'Em.

06:55.030 --> 06:56.140
-Good boy, Manny.

07:00.150 --> 07:02.220
Fanta! Fanta! Stick that in the pot!

07:02.230 --> 07:05.030
Get that in the pot! Be the boss.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.100
-(Fanta gasping)

07:06.110 --> 07:07.090
-(gun clicks, fires)

07:07.100 --> 07:08.140
-Aah!

07:10.040 --> 07:11.230
-That's how you become the boss.

07:14.190 --> 07:16.180
-You hear from your investor? Still coming in, isn't he?

07:16.190 --> 07:19.070
-At midday. Just like I told you eight times yesterday.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.060
-All right, just checking.

07:20.070 --> 07:21.090
If you need me, I'll be in the back.

07:22.090 --> 07:23.100
-Is he all right?

07:23.110 --> 07:25.090
-We just need this investment,

07:25.100 --> 07:26.200
or this place goes under by the end of the month.

07:26.210 --> 07:30.010
-(cursing in Spanish)

07:32.040 --> 07:34.020
-(clattering)

07:35.030 --> 07:37.040
-Oh, she just wanted something I couldn't commit to

07:37.050 --> 07:38.130
at this point in my life.

07:43.170 --> 07:45.000
-Vic: Morning, Albert.

07:46.000 --> 07:46.230
-All right.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.210
-What's the matter, son? You seem distracted.

07:48.220 --> 07:49.230
-No, just getting ready for a meeting.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.230
-A meeting that requires a stiff drink

07:52.000 --> 07:53.050
at 11 o'clock in the morning?

07:53.060 --> 07:54.090
-Don't worry. Just a drink.

07:55.130 --> 07:56.170
-But I do worry, Albert.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.230
Ooh!

07:59.000 --> 08:02.090
I am a partner in this fine establishment, after all.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.120
-You're a silent partner, yeah, so just...

08:04.130 --> 08:06.020
And seeing as I've had my wings clipped

08:06.030 --> 08:07.090
by you and your mother in regards

08:07.100 --> 08:08.140
to my usual line of work,

08:08.150 --> 08:10.110
may I remind you that this is

08:10.120 --> 08:13.020
our only source of income at the present juncture.

08:13.030 --> 08:15.060
-It's a meeting with an investor.

08:15.070 --> 08:17.000
And I've got big plans for this place.

08:17.010 --> 08:19.140
-We are Hills. We don't borrow money, we take it.

08:19.150 --> 08:20.220
-Yeah, well, you know better than anyone

08:20.230 --> 08:22.010
we're doing things differently now.

08:22.020 --> 08:23.200
It doesn't involve robbing banks, does it?

08:23.210 --> 08:24.190
-(chuckles)

08:24.200 --> 08:26.180
-The Hills now make an honest living.

08:26.190 --> 08:29.080
-As honest as the day is long.

08:35.020 --> 08:36.140
-(oil sizzling)

08:36.150 --> 08:38.120
-Fry the onions. -No!

08:38.130 --> 08:40.000
-What's the matter? You getting all excited.

08:40.010 --> 08:41.200
-Henry, stop pretending you can cook

08:41.210 --> 08:43.050
and let's go and have a sharpener.

08:43.060 --> 08:45.020
-It's about that time, Victor. -(chuckles)

08:45.030 --> 08:47.200
-Fanta, do not make a dog's dinner out of that paella.

08:47.210 --> 08:49.150
-I'll be back later. -What?

08:49.160 --> 08:51.040
-Behave yourself.

08:51.050 --> 08:52.140
Vic, I'm coming!

09:11.230 --> 09:13.010
-Good morning, gentlemen.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.010
Welcome to The Bunker Bar.

09:17.060 --> 09:19.190
-It's not speaking to me, Lenny.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.130
-Looks like a non-starter to me, Bruce.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.150
-Albert: As you look around you, gentlemen,

09:30.160 --> 09:32.000
you see nothing more than...

09:32.010 --> 09:33.230
well, a work in progress.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.050
I mean, and let's face it, not unlike

09:36.060 --> 09:38.010
many of the other ramshackle establishments

09:38.020 --> 09:39.100
flogging paella up and down the Costa.

09:39.110 --> 09:41.080
-It's a bit hot in here, don't you think?

09:41.090 --> 09:42.150
-Lenny: You might want... -(fly buzzing)

09:42.160 --> 09:45.010
...to consider putting a few ceiling fans.

09:48.210 --> 09:50.210
-Yeah, now what I ask of you is to, uh--

09:50.220 --> 09:52.060
is to call upon your imaginations

09:52.070 --> 09:53.190
and cast your minds to a time in the future

09:53.200 --> 09:56.040
where The Bunker Bar is not just

09:56.050 --> 09:58.090
one of the Costa del Sol's best destinations

09:58.100 --> 10:00.130
but the only one worth going to.

10:00.140 --> 10:01.160
Now, imagine it, a place

10:01.170 --> 10:04.020
where the Euro elite will be treated

10:04.030 --> 10:07.110
to an oceanfront experience like no other.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.230
-What else we got on today?

10:11.130 --> 10:14.000
-I've got a charity do at four.

10:14.010 --> 10:15.210
-Paella de la casa, senores.

10:19.110 --> 10:21.090
-I can't stomach that foreign crap.

10:22.090 --> 10:23.080
Disagrees with me.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.140
-(clears throat)

10:24.150 --> 10:28.010
We will evoke the elegance, the style,

10:28.020 --> 10:31.000
and the spirit of 60s Saint-Tropez.

10:31.010 --> 10:34.040
-Yes, and, uh, build a pier

10:34.050 --> 10:35.050
to moor the yachts,

10:35.060 --> 10:37.120
attracting all manner of big spenders.

10:37.130 --> 10:39.130
-And staying open till 6:00 a.m. every night

10:39.140 --> 10:41.070
will surely keep the drinks flowing

10:41.080 --> 10:43.150
and the, uh, punters dancing.

10:43.160 --> 10:45.080
-I'll bet they haven't even got a booze license yet.

10:45.090 --> 10:47.070
-Can't do nothing without a booze license, can ya?

10:48.220 --> 10:51.020
-Well, a liquor license is a line item

10:51.030 --> 10:52.050
on the investment plan.

10:52.060 --> 10:53.220
-Yeah, well, we've applied at the town hall,

10:53.230 --> 10:55.130
and we expect approval very soon.

10:55.140 --> 10:56.180
It's just a formality.

10:56.190 --> 10:58.150
-They've got more chance of getting a wank off the pope

10:58.160 --> 11:01.110
than a liquor license from the San Toledo town hall.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.060
-Right, well, I'm not exactly sure

11:03.070 --> 11:04.140
how I'd get a wank off anyone.

11:04.150 --> 11:05.120
-Hey...

11:06.150 --> 11:07.130
I meant--

11:08.150 --> 11:09.130
-(spits) -(bullet clinks)

11:11.030 --> 11:12.040
-What's that?

11:13.090 --> 11:15.050
Nine millimeter.

11:15.060 --> 11:18.100
-Yeah, so, we're looking for an angel investment

11:18.110 --> 11:20.110
of 200,000 euros

11:20.120 --> 11:22.210
for a 25 percent shareholding in the company.

11:22.220 --> 11:24.130
-(chuckles)

11:24.140 --> 11:25.190
They're gonna have a drink on us.

11:25.200 --> 11:28.100
-Yeah. Just not here, though.

11:29.190 --> 11:31.150
-You know, if they manage to blag

11:31.160 --> 11:33.190
getting that booze license,

11:33.200 --> 11:35.040
it might be worth a punt, Lenny.

11:35.050 --> 11:36.090
-Wouldn't hold your breath.

11:36.100 --> 11:38.040
This lot couldn't sell a packet of peas.

11:41.020 --> 11:42.140
-Outside, now.

11:45.010 --> 11:46.010
-Hate 'Em. -Yeah.

11:47.020 --> 11:48.170
-Do you know anything about this investor

11:48.180 --> 11:50.040
Albert's meeting with?

11:50.050 --> 11:52.030
-Investor? Ain't got a clue.

11:52.040 --> 11:55.020
These kids trying to, uh... trying to retire us, Vic?

11:55.030 --> 11:56.170
-Yeah, certainly appears that way.

11:57.220 --> 12:01.060
But I did sign up for this whole going straight malarkey.

12:01.070 --> 12:03.220
I made a promise to Albert and Lily, didn't I?

12:03.230 --> 12:05.230
-That you did, my old mucker, and, uh...

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
we're very proud of you for keeping your word, mate.

12:09.130 --> 12:12.180
All right, should we, uh... should we get hammered?

12:12.190 --> 12:15.030
'Cause there's fuck all else to do around here, now is there?

12:15.040 --> 12:16.210
-(laughing)

12:21.230 --> 12:23.160
-Lenny and Bruce seem more like contract killers

12:23.170 --> 12:24.210
than property developers.

12:25.210 --> 12:27.180
-Does one need to exclude the other?

12:27.190 --> 12:30.030
-Yes, Charlie, in this case, it does.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.150
-Okay, so it's true, they may be

12:31.160 --> 12:33.190
a little bit more colorful than we've let on,

12:33.200 --> 12:35.100
but would you have met them if we had told you?

12:35.110 --> 12:37.020
-Uh... no.

12:37.030 --> 12:39.120
-My understanding was we need investment immediately

12:39.130 --> 12:41.020
to stay afloat, and it's not as if we have

12:41.030 --> 12:42.180
other potential investors lining up

12:42.190 --> 12:43.200
around the block, is it?

12:43.210 --> 12:45.040
-Yeah, to be fair, Al,

12:45.050 --> 12:47.020
if we can't pilfer the money,

12:47.030 --> 12:48.170
it seems our options are severely limited.

12:48.180 --> 12:49.200
-What's going on?

12:49.210 --> 12:51.190
-I'll tell you what's going on, Billy.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.000
After we lost all our money,

12:53.010 --> 12:55.000
before even landing on the sunny shores of Spain,

12:55.010 --> 12:56.140
we decided we were gonna do things differently.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.180
We decided we were going to build ourselves a future.

12:58.190 --> 13:00.090
Going straight was what we decided on.

13:00.100 --> 13:02.040
What we all fucking decided on.

13:03.050 --> 13:05.050
-So, what's the problem? Somebody nick something?

13:05.060 --> 13:08.030
-No, no, Billy, no. The problem is, the plan isn't working.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.050
-All right, calm down.

13:09.060 --> 13:11.050
We're just getting started, aren't we? It's a new business.

13:11.060 --> 13:12.220
It takes time to build a successful business.

13:12.230 --> 13:14.120
-As a partner in this business,

13:14.130 --> 13:16.170
I personally feel that there are times where we can afford

13:16.180 --> 13:18.070
to be a little bit more flexible in our approach.

13:19.180 --> 13:21.120
And now might be one of those times.

13:25.210 --> 13:27.020
-All right. I'll tell you what.

13:27.030 --> 13:28.140
Let's take this for a walk then, shall we, Charlie?

13:29.140 --> 13:31.080
Let's say we decide to be a little bit more...

13:31.090 --> 13:32.180
flexible in our approach.

13:32.190 --> 13:35.040
How do you suspect we secure an investment from Lenny and Bruce?

13:35.050 --> 13:36.200
We ain't even got a bloody liquor license, have we?

13:36.210 --> 13:38.070
It could be weeks or even months

13:38.080 --> 13:39.070
before we get one approved,

13:39.080 --> 13:40.120
and that's if we get it approved at all.

13:40.130 --> 13:42.130
-Yeah, well, I might just have a plan

13:42.140 --> 13:44.080
on how to speed that process up.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.090
-Oh, yeah, what are you gonna do?

13:45.100 --> 13:46.180
You gonna bribe a government official, are ya?

13:46.190 --> 13:49.210
-Got wind of a street fight at a gypsy camp this afternoon.

13:49.220 --> 13:51.140
We put you in, Billy,

13:51.150 --> 13:53.080
we can win enough money to grease the right palm

13:53.090 --> 13:54.200
to secure that booze license.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.200
Sometimes, it takes a crooked path

13:59.210 --> 14:01.060
to finally go straight.

14:02.230 --> 14:04.030
-Oh...

14:13.190 --> 14:15.150
Well, if we do this, we do this once

14:15.160 --> 14:17.010
and once only to secure this investment.

14:17.020 --> 14:18.140
And we tell no one,

14:18.150 --> 14:19.210
especially not my old man.

14:19.220 --> 14:21.040
Last thing I need is Vic Hill thinking

14:21.050 --> 14:22.050
it's open season, right?

14:22.060 --> 14:23.080
-Right. -Right?

14:23.090 --> 14:24.130
Right.

14:42.190 --> 14:43.170
-For you.

14:43.180 --> 14:45.180
-Gracias.   -Gracias.

14:45.190 --> 14:46.180
-Cheers, baby. -Yeah.

14:47.180 --> 14:48.150
-Fuckin' Spain.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.180
(groans)

14:53.030 --> 14:54.140
-Oi, oi, oi, get your own.

14:54.150 --> 14:55.190
-What do you need this for, 'Em?

14:55.200 --> 14:57.100
-Hate 'Em: What do you mean, what do I need that for?

14:57.110 --> 14:58.230
In case it goes sideways.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.220
Have you forgotten how we got robbed on the way

15:00.230 --> 15:02.130
to this shithole of a town?

15:02.140 --> 15:04.070
-No, I have not forgotten, 'Em.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.220
When I find those bastards,

15:05.230 --> 15:08.030
I shall paint this whole  pueblo  red.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.120
-Yeah, make sure you do.

15:12.070 --> 15:14.080
-Should I let you in on a little secret, 'Em?

15:14.090 --> 15:15.190
-Go ahead, I'm all ears.

15:16.230 --> 15:18.150
-I miss it.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.190
The robbing.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.070
(sharp exhale)

15:21.080 --> 15:22.120
I miss the buzz.

15:24.130 --> 15:26.140
-Well, you know, we could...

15:26.150 --> 15:28.150
do a little job, something low key,

15:28.160 --> 15:30.070
just to keep your eye in, hmm?

15:32.010 --> 15:33.020
-You got something in mind, Hate 'Em?

15:34.050 --> 15:35.060
-What's up, Mr. Dimes?

15:36.080 --> 15:38.220
You got an itch that needs scratching, eh?

15:41.050 --> 15:43.150
-No, no, no, no, I'm retired.

15:43.160 --> 15:46.000
I must be a decent husband and father.

15:46.010 --> 15:47.120
I shall sit sedentary...

15:48.160 --> 15:51.110
nostalgically espousing the glory days

15:51.120 --> 15:53.080
of my yesteryears.

15:53.090 --> 15:55.130
-Probably for the best, eh? -Hmm.

15:55.140 --> 15:56.160
(grunts)

15:56.170 --> 15:58.070
-Wouldn't you say?

15:58.080 --> 15:59.200
-Yeah.

15:59.210 --> 16:01.050
-Yeah. Cheers.

16:06.210 --> 16:08.180
-Are you sure you're all right to do this?

16:08.190 --> 16:11.010
You've not exactly been looking after yourself recently, have you?

16:11.020 --> 16:12.220
-How else are we gonna get the money we need

16:12.230 --> 16:14.070
to get our license, eh, Al?

16:15.100 --> 16:17.110
-Mate, it's been six months, and we're already back at it.

16:17.120 --> 16:20.020
-(sharp exhale) -Street fights, bribing government officials.

16:20.030 --> 16:21.140
I thought we was gonna go on a straight run

16:21.150 --> 16:23.000
in sunny fucking Spain,

16:23.010 --> 16:24.150
see if we could do it without all this shit.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.070
-But that's life, innit?

16:26.080 --> 16:27.130
Full of disappointments.

16:29.230 --> 16:30.210
-Yeah, come on.

16:40.230 --> 16:43.120
-You know, Charlie, when we get this liquor license

16:43.130 --> 16:44.190
and the investment money,

16:44.200 --> 16:47.170
I'm gonna help turn The Bunker Bar into something.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.120
You know, I did it with Sonny's club in London.

16:49.130 --> 16:50.200
I can do it for us here in Spain.

16:50.210 --> 16:53.130
-Well, I don't doubt you for a second, Lotti.

16:53.140 --> 16:54.170
-(Lotti sighs)

16:54.180 --> 16:56.220
-First things first.

16:56.230 --> 16:58.230
-How do I look?  -Muy bonito, senorita.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.140
-Muchas gracias, senor.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.180
(clears throat)

17:05.190 --> 17:07.000
-Si.

17:07.010 --> 17:08.110
-Uh, good day,  senor.

17:08.120 --> 17:11.080
We're here to check the status of our liquor license application, please.

17:11.090 --> 17:12.230
-Are you San Toledo citizen?

17:13.000 --> 17:15.120
-Uh, well, not yet.

17:15.130 --> 17:17.200
I'd have to marry a man from San Toledo

17:17.210 --> 17:19.060
for that, wouldn't I?

17:20.140 --> 17:22.170
-Licenses can only be granted

17:22.180 --> 17:24.090
to San Toledo citizens.

17:24.100 --> 17:26.230
It's in the small print on your form.

17:28.010 --> 17:30.090
Your applications will be denied.

17:30.100 --> 17:32.190
I'm sorry, I cannot help you.

17:32.200 --> 17:35.060
-Well, maybe we could help you,

17:35.070 --> 17:39.050
Senor  Ramirez,  "Sub. Aux. Administrativo."

17:42.200 --> 17:44.000
-Help me how, exactly?

17:45.010 --> 17:49.070
-Look, why don't we cut all this pointless red tape, shall we?

17:49.080 --> 17:50.180
We'll be so much better off without it.

17:50.190 --> 17:54.180
-Hm? Bureaucracy can be such a bore.

17:56.220 --> 17:59.090
-No, I cannot be bought.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.180
Mm? I have my pride...

18:01.190 --> 18:03.160
and my future to think of.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.040
-Ramirez.  -Si, Senor  Gonzalez.

18:08.050 --> 18:09.210
-(in Spanish)

18:10.230 --> 18:12.070
-This beautiful girl...

18:13.070 --> 18:15.050
and the man are leaving.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.130
-I think he was checking you out, Lotti.

18:23.140 --> 18:26.110
-(scoffs) Actually, I think you're more his type, Charlie.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.140
-Good day.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.150
-(clearing throat)

18:37.020 --> 18:39.070
-(crowd chanting, indistinct)

18:50.230 --> 18:52.100
-What's the deal, Al?

18:52.110 --> 18:55.020
-Spin his jaw, let's get out of here, all right?

18:56.020 --> 18:57.170
-(shouting, cheering)

19:07.060 --> 19:08.020
-(grunting)

19:10.180 --> 19:11.180
-Hit me!

19:14.150 --> 19:16.160
-(mouthing)

19:16.170 --> 19:18.200
-(crowd shouting)

20:08.030 --> 20:10.050
-(shouting continues)

20:18.190 --> 20:19.180
-Man: Hey!

20:21.080 --> 20:22.230
I am Angel Fajardo.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.070
A fight promoter.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.000
-Albert Dimes.

20:27.010 --> 20:28.190
-Nice to meet you.

20:28.200 --> 20:31.030
A good fight. You have talent.

20:31.040 --> 20:32.060
-Yeah, cheers.

20:32.070 --> 20:33.220
-Are you his manager, Albert?

20:33.230 --> 20:37.230
-Correct. -I've got an event on Saturday night,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.090
and a fighter dropped out.

20:40.100 --> 20:41.210
I need that replacement.

20:41.220 --> 20:44.050
Do you want your boy to fight on a real card?

20:45.070 --> 20:46.090
-Is it a pro fight?

20:46.100 --> 20:48.080
-(laughs) Yes.

20:48.090 --> 20:49.130
Claro,  a pro fight,

20:49.150 --> 20:51.150
in a ring, with gloves...

20:51.160 --> 20:52.210
-I know what a pro fight is.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.130
I don't know, what you reckon, Billy Boy?

20:56.140 --> 20:57.210
You want to be a pro fighter?

21:05.090 --> 21:06.080
Cheers.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.150
-(kisses) Hello, Mum. -Hello, love.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.140
-(grunts)

21:10.150 --> 21:12.180
-How's business? You doing okay?

21:13.180 --> 21:14.230
-Yeah, we're doing fine.

21:17.100 --> 21:18.150
-Please don't do that.

21:21.220 --> 21:23.060
-What's the matter with you?

21:24.120 --> 21:25.200
-I think I've lost your father.

21:26.210 --> 21:28.080
-Here we go again, lost him how?

21:29.220 --> 21:32.180
-Well, he was supposed to come home for lunch, but he didn't.

21:32.190 --> 21:35.080
-Oh, Mum, come on, he'll be back with his tail between his legs

21:35.090 --> 21:36.190
by dinner time, you know what he's like.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.180
-No, well, that's just the thing.

21:37.190 --> 21:39.080
I don't think I do anymore, Albert.

21:40.210 --> 21:42.070
It's hard to adjust having him back

21:42.080 --> 21:43.180
after all those years in prison.

21:45.190 --> 21:47.190
I think maybe I'm being a bit too controlling.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.100
-You're not. Fifteen years apart's a long time, innit?

21:53.070 --> 21:54.210
Anyway, he's probably just out having a quiet drink

21:54.220 --> 21:55.220
with Hate 'Em somewhere.

21:58.090 --> 22:00.140
(cheering)

22:00.150 --> 22:02.030
-(Vic laughing)

22:04.220 --> 22:06.090
-(gunshots)

22:08.230 --> 22:09.220
-(burps)

22:09.230 --> 22:11.200
-Hate 'Em, don't go, have another one.

22:11.210 --> 22:13.190
No, no, Vic, I've got to go, mate. I've got to go.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.120
-Go where? -I've got a bit of work.

22:15.130 --> 22:17.020
-A bit of work? Well, what bit of work?

22:17.030 --> 22:20.130
-You see, uh, she collared a couple of Spaniards

22:20.140 --> 22:23.210
loading boxes and boxes of gear into this old factory.

22:23.220 --> 22:25.080
I'm gonna take a little peek,

22:25.090 --> 22:26.220
see if there's anything I can have over, all right?

22:26.230 --> 22:29.040
-We were supposed to behave ourselves, Hate 'Em.

22:29.050 --> 22:31.090
-(chuckles) No, no, Vic, no.

22:31.100 --> 22:34.080
Victor, you were supposed to behave yourself.

22:34.090 --> 22:35.180
Not me. (kisses)

22:35.190 --> 22:37.050
All right, my little babe?

22:37.060 --> 22:38.060
You take that.

22:39.140 --> 22:41.100
See you later. I've got work to do.

22:42.170 --> 22:44.010
-(sighs)

22:46.000 --> 22:47.220
To be Vic Hill,

22:47.230 --> 22:49.210
or not to be Vic Hill,

22:50.220 --> 22:53.200
that is the question.

23:01.150 --> 23:03.100
-So if we can't bribe him,

23:03.110 --> 23:05.100
how are we gonna get him onside?

23:06.200 --> 23:08.140
-Every man has his price.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.100
Mind if we join you,  Senor Ramirez ?

23:24.150 --> 23:25.200
-What are you doing here?

23:25.210 --> 23:28.010
-We're here to help you with your problem.

23:28.020 --> 23:29.110
-What problem?

23:29.120 --> 23:32.120
-Oh, well, maybe "problem" is the wrong word.

23:32.130 --> 23:35.030
More like your situation.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.170
-I think maybe you are confused.

23:37.180 --> 23:39.090
I do not have situation.

23:40.110 --> 23:42.160
It's okay. You know, now that we're friends,

23:42.170 --> 23:44.050
we'll do whatever we can to help.

23:44.060 --> 23:45.230
-Help me? How?

23:47.020 --> 23:50.180
-By getting you the thing you really desire.

23:50.190 --> 23:52.210
-Charlie: No, no, no, more than that.

23:52.220 --> 23:54.170
The thing that you really deserve.

23:55.200 --> 23:58.160
-And what is it that I really deserve?

23:59.170 --> 24:01.050
-Smart man like you.

24:02.060 --> 24:03.110
Man who looks out for his friends

24:03.120 --> 24:05.030
with the same determination they look out for him.

24:06.050 --> 24:07.110
(scoffs) Isn't it obvious?

24:08.150 --> 24:09.140
-Not completely.

24:09.150 --> 24:11.140
-All you have to do is announce to the world

24:11.150 --> 24:13.150
the thing you really, really want.

24:13.160 --> 24:16.110
-But I'm not sure that I know

24:16.120 --> 24:18.110
what I really, really want.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.230
-Be brave.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.070
Say it out loud.

24:25.020 --> 24:26.100
-Okay,

24:26.110 --> 24:27.140
maybe...

24:29.110 --> 24:30.190
a promotion.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.110
-Say it like your life depends on it. -(Lotti laughing)

24:33.120 --> 24:35.000
-A promotion!

24:35.010 --> 24:37.170
-Lottie/Charlie: A promotion! (laughing)

24:42.050 --> 24:43.090
-It's not too late to turn back

24:43.100 --> 24:44.200
if you've lost your asshole already.

24:44.210 --> 24:46.190
-My bollocks aren't in a vice.

24:46.200 --> 24:48.090
I'm Vic Hill.

24:48.100 --> 24:50.020
If I want to have a little peek,

24:50.030 --> 24:51.130
I'll have a little peek.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.060
Vic: Quietly, Hate 'Em.

25:01.070 --> 25:02.080
Quietly.

25:06.150 --> 25:07.220
-(whispering) They're in here somewhere.

25:07.230 --> 25:09.220
-"Azucar."

25:09.230 --> 25:11.030
-Hate 'Em: Yeah, that means "sugar."

25:11.040 --> 25:12.160
It was a sugar factory.

25:12.170 --> 25:14.000
-Was it? -Yeah.

25:18.180 --> 25:20.170
-Aren't you a clever boy, Hate 'Em? -Told ya, didn't I tell ya?

25:20.180 --> 25:22.190
(whispers) Come...

25:22.200 --> 25:24.060
-(Vic grunts) -Hate 'Em: Help me up here, help me up.

25:24.070 --> 25:25.070
-Vic: Oh, yeah. Heavy. -(Hate 'Em grunts)

25:25.080 --> 25:27.030
Cheers, mate.

25:27.040 --> 25:29.040
Oh, look at it, look at it, look at it.

25:32.060 --> 25:34.060
-"Toromenn." Never heard of it.

25:36.030 --> 25:39.100
-Fuck. It's a mountain of fake Viagra.

25:39.110 --> 25:41.210
-How'd you know it's fake Viagra?

25:41.220 --> 25:43.110
-Oh, what do you mean how do I know?

25:43.120 --> 25:44.180
I seen it on an advert, didn't I?

25:44.190 --> 25:46.110
-(both laughing)

25:46.120 --> 25:49.190
-Horn pills. Must admit, I wasn't expecting that.

25:49.200 --> 25:52.100
It must be-- must be thousands of pills here.

25:52.110 --> 25:53.140
We could put these to use.

25:53.150 --> 25:55.190
-You struggling with the ol' meat and two veg, then, huh?

25:55.200 --> 25:57.070
-Obviously I don't need it for myself.

25:57.080 --> 25:59.000
My tackle is fit for purpose, son.

25:59.010 --> 26:00.080
-(Hate 'Em chuckles)

26:00.090 --> 26:02.110
-This much gear must be worth a mint.

26:02.120 --> 26:05.130
We flog it, we might make enough money to set Albert

26:05.140 --> 26:07.030
and The Bunker Bar back on terra firma.

26:07.040 --> 26:08.100
-What you mean, The Bunker Bar?

26:08.110 --> 26:11.050
-With a little left over for us, of course.

26:11.060 --> 26:13.020
-(both laughing)

26:13.030 --> 26:14.090
-Well, let get this loaded up.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.150
-(pigeons cooing)

26:32.220 --> 26:34.200
-Uh, do you mind?

26:35.230 --> 26:36.190
-What?

26:38.160 --> 26:40.070
Aren't you the friend of Ramirez?

26:41.080 --> 26:43.080
-Oh, yeah, I was just-- I was just walking by.

26:44.210 --> 26:46.160
I couldn't help notice how...

26:47.200 --> 26:49.150
lonely you looked.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.210
Sad to have such a stunning view...

26:54.210 --> 26:56.130
and no one to share it with,

26:56.140 --> 27:00.060
at least... not anybody you...

27:01.060 --> 27:02.110
want to share it with.

27:20.190 --> 27:22.210
Ha... (inhales sharply)

27:26.210 --> 27:30.130
Ha, pigeons... (chuckles)

27:31.180 --> 27:34.020
You know, they're not unlike humans.

27:35.140 --> 27:37.180
Hm, um, gentle,

27:38.200 --> 27:39.200
intelligent...

27:41.140 --> 27:44.000
and they have very complex

27:44.010 --> 27:46.190
social relationships.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.090
(crunching)

27:54.130 --> 27:56.140
If you ever get tired of being lonely,

27:56.150 --> 27:58.090
or pretending not to be...

27:59.220 --> 28:02.110
I'll be at a party at The Bunker Bar later tonight.

28:03.220 --> 28:04.220
(chuckles)

28:09.020 --> 28:10.120
And I like to dance.

28:16.030 --> 28:17.000
(bell dinging)

28:17.010 --> 28:18.100
-Albert: Espresso's up!

28:20.050 --> 28:23.110
-Billy, espresso. -(phone buzzing)

28:23.120 --> 28:25.020
-What?

28:25.030 --> 28:27.060
Table four, go on. Charlie, talk to me.

28:27.070 --> 28:30.090
-Change of plan. We don't need the money for the bribe.

28:30.100 --> 28:32.020
We need it to throw a party.

28:32.030 --> 28:34.040
We'll have a special   guest of honor.

28:35.180 --> 28:38.160
-Come, on, lad. Told ya! Come on, lad.

28:38.170 --> 28:40.100
Come on. There you go.

28:40.110 --> 28:42.110
-Chop, chop, Hate 'Em. Chop, chop.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.200
-Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop...

28:49.030 --> 28:50.000
-Whoa! -Hey, hey, hey!

28:55.100 --> 28:57.000
-(indistinct)

29:01.200 --> 29:03.100
-Vic: Come on, Hate 'Em. Come on, Hate 'Em.

29:03.110 --> 29:04.110
Come on, here we go, here we go.

29:04.120 --> 29:07.090
-Shit! It's the pigs! Run! Run!

29:09.090 --> 29:10.210
-(shouting)

29:10.220 --> 29:12.130
-This way, this way, this way!

29:12.140 --> 29:13.130
-This way! This way!

29:13.140 --> 29:15.050
-Come on, Hate 'Em. Ooh, yeah.

29:15.060 --> 29:16.030
-Oh, shit!

29:32.070 --> 29:34.200
-(laughing)

29:36.160 --> 29:37.150
Don't shoot.

29:38.160 --> 29:40.100
I was only looking for some sugar for my tea.

29:44.170 --> 29:45.200
-Oh, Vic.

29:47.100 --> 29:48.130
(sighs)

29:56.180 --> 29:58.100
-(dance music playing)

30:00.190 --> 30:02.120
-You guys did well organizing this party.

30:02.130 --> 30:04.040
-It's not difficult when you're paying people in cash

30:04.050 --> 30:05.060
to drink for free, is it Charlie?

30:05.070 --> 30:06.030
This better work.

30:06.040 --> 30:08.060
-A little faith, please, would be nice, Al.

30:08.070 --> 30:10.050
-Careful with this stuff, Charlie boy.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.200
Powerful shit, all right?

30:12.210 --> 30:13.210
-Please, Billy.

30:13.220 --> 30:16.220
Recreational chemistry is my area of expertise.

30:16.230 --> 30:20.000
Just get him off his nut and we'll nail him bang to rights.

30:21.140 --> 30:23.080
Oh, here he is.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.070
-How do I look? -Sharp, really nice.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.070
-All right.

30:38.180 --> 30:39.170
-I'm glad you came.

30:41.020 --> 30:42.220
-I'm glad you invited me.

30:44.040 --> 30:45.190
What's your name, by the way?

30:45.200 --> 30:47.010
I am Augustin.

30:48.060 --> 30:49.040
-My name is...

30:50.070 --> 30:51.100
Ledbetter.

30:52.110 --> 30:55.010
-Encantado,  Ledbetter.

30:55.020 --> 30:57.110
-Encantado,  Augustin.

31:00.160 --> 31:02.000
-Salud.   -Salud.

31:02.010 --> 31:04.120
-(music continues)

31:16.120 --> 31:18.000
-Lotti: Look at Charlie go.

31:18.010 --> 31:20.060
You got to admit he's adorable.

31:20.070 --> 31:21.140
-That's debatable.

31:23.180 --> 31:26.160
-Are you all right? -Yeah, I'm fine.

31:29.030 --> 31:33.000
-Look, Billy, I'm not saying the door's closed on us forever.

31:34.130 --> 31:36.170
I just need time to get on my own two feet.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.220
I don't even know what it feels like to be on my own.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.120
-Yeah, well, you already said that.

31:41.130 --> 31:42.170
-I want us to be friends, Billy.

31:45.160 --> 31:48.150
-I got some good news today, about this boxing fight. It--

31:48.160 --> 31:49.160
-Charlie's making his move.

31:52.030 --> 31:53.030
-What's that?

31:53.040 --> 31:54.130
-Ecstasy.

31:54.140 --> 31:57.120
-No, no, no. I've never done ecstasy before.

31:57.130 --> 31:58.200
-Neither have I.

31:58.210 --> 32:00.010
But I thought, you know,

32:00.020 --> 32:02.120
it might be a night of firsts for both of us.

32:02.130 --> 32:03.130
-Okay.

32:12.120 --> 32:14.090
-(music continues)

32:26.030 --> 32:28.010
-Come here. Look at him.

32:28.020 --> 32:29.170
He ain't even close to going over, is he?

32:29.180 --> 32:31.110
-Slip him another one. -I just slipped him three more!

32:33.100 --> 32:35.140
The man has a constitution of an elephant.

32:35.140 --> 32:37.070
He expects me to match him pill for pill.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.190
I haven't had this many beans in my bloodstream since the rave at Stonehenge.

32:39.200 --> 32:42.200
-The plan isn't working, Charlie. Change it.

32:45.060 --> 32:47.020
Go on. Go on.

32:49.190 --> 32:51.110
-(siren blaring)

32:57.230 --> 33:01.010
-Aw! A TV. How kind of ya.

33:05.030 --> 33:07.050
-Hate 'Em (on TV):  So how's retirement looking   for you now, Vic, eh?

33:07.060 --> 33:09.050
-Vic (on TV):  I'll shit retirement.

33:09.060 --> 33:11.030
Victor Hill is back! Yes!

33:11.040 --> 33:12.130
-(Hate 'Em howling) -Vic:  Comin' in.

33:12.140 --> 33:14.030
(laughs)

33:14.040 --> 33:15.190
-(Hate 'Em howling)

33:17.090 --> 33:19.130
-Ah! Love it! Come on!

33:21.010 --> 33:23.230
No. I have a better idea.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.120
I saw it once in a movie.

33:29.230 --> 33:30.220
-Okay then.

33:32.020 --> 33:33.000
Good.

33:35.190 --> 33:37.160
-(sniffing)

33:37.170 --> 33:39.020
(grunts)

33:39.030 --> 33:40.220
(sniffs) Oh!

33:40.230 --> 33:42.160
(coughs)

33:42.170 --> 33:43.160
Your turn.

33:45.090 --> 33:47.120
Come on, come on, come on.

33:47.130 --> 33:49.080
Hey! Go, go, go, go, go...

33:52.160 --> 33:55.060
Yes! Yes! (laughs)

33:58.040 --> 33:59.140
Time to dance!

33:59.150 --> 34:00.180
-Yeah.

34:10.110 --> 34:12.120
-(music continues)

34:23.030 --> 34:24.070
-Fanta!

34:36.150 --> 34:38.030
-Oh! -(screaming)

34:38.040 --> 34:39.130
-Ledbetter! -(Charlie groaning)

34:39.140 --> 34:40.170
-Ledbetter!

34:42.140 --> 34:45.080
-Le-- Led-- Ledbetter.

34:45.090 --> 34:46.100
-(groaning)

34:46.110 --> 34:48.090
-Ledbetter! -Billy: Out of the way!

34:48.100 --> 34:50.040
Shit. Charlie.

34:51.070 --> 34:52.070
He's not breathing.

34:56.130 --> 34:57.120
What did you do to him?

34:57.130 --> 34:59.010
-Oh, no, no, no-- -What did you do to him?

34:59.020 --> 35:00.060
-It wasn't like that!

35:00.070 --> 35:01.140
-No, no-- -I'm calling the police.

35:01.150 --> 35:02.200
-No, no, no, please, the police.

35:02.210 --> 35:04.230
No, no, no, la policia.   No, por favor. No, no, no--

35:05.000 --> 35:06.010
-Come here!

35:06.020 --> 35:07.180
-No, no, la policia.   No, por favor!

35:07.190 --> 35:09.040
No, no, no--

35:09.050 --> 35:10.210
-Charlie. Charlie!

35:10.220 --> 35:11.190
What happened here?

35:11.200 --> 35:13.210
Charlie? Charlie, wake up, mate.

35:13.220 --> 35:15.210
-Charlie! -So, what can I do? How can I help?

35:15.220 --> 35:17.190
-What can you do? You can get out of here!

35:17.200 --> 35:19.090
-Billy, get him out of here, now! -Come on!

35:19.100 --> 35:21.040
-Charlie! Charlie, it's Albert.

35:21.050 --> 35:23.020
Listen to me, Charlie. Wake up!

35:23.030 --> 35:24.040
Charlie!

35:24.050 --> 35:26.150
You better not be dead, Charlie! Charlie!

35:27.180 --> 35:29.000
-(people gasp)

35:29.010 --> 35:30.080
-(cheering)

35:34.100 --> 35:35.200
-Didn't even touch the sides, Al.

35:38.000 --> 35:38.220
-Come on, get up.

35:45.180 --> 35:47.040
Please tell me you got all of it.

35:51.090 --> 35:52.070
Nice.

36:00.070 --> 36:01.230
-Oh, no, no, no--   -What did you do to him?

36:02.000 --> 36:03.200
It wasn't like that!   No, no...

36:16.130 --> 36:17.140
-(siren blares)

36:27.180 --> 36:28.140
-(Vic groans)

36:29.150 --> 36:30.110
-(switch clicks)

36:49.220 --> 36:51.180
-I'm Lieutenant Carlito Blanco.

36:54.080 --> 36:57.210
I'm the top dog in the San Toledo police department.

37:01.130 --> 37:04.010
Detective Lupe tells me you're a funny guy.

37:04.020 --> 37:06.140
-Oh, yeah, I'm fucking hilarious, mate.

37:06.150 --> 37:09.170
-(laughs)

37:20.000 --> 37:21.030
(blows)

37:21.040 --> 37:22.200
Oops.

37:24.180 --> 37:26.220
It appears the joke is over.

37:32.060 --> 37:34.000
-(car approaching)

37:38.190 --> 37:40.090
-Morning, gentlemen.

37:42.010 --> 37:45.120
-I think this place has a lot of potential, Lenny.

37:47.130 --> 37:48.140
-Bundles, Bruce.

37:49.150 --> 37:50.230
Bundles.

37:52.200 --> 37:55.020
-Billy will show you through. I'll be right with ya.

37:55.030 --> 37:56.050
-Follow me.

38:06.080 --> 38:08.080
-(exhales) Okay, let's close this deal.

38:11.130 --> 38:14.180
-(car approaching)

38:16.010 --> 38:18.160
-Gentlemen, I have here

38:18.170 --> 38:22.040
a fully approved late night liquor license.

38:26.160 --> 38:28.200
-Well, we've gotta park this money somewhere.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.170
Might as well be here.

38:33.180 --> 38:34.170
-Might as well be.

38:34.180 --> 38:35.160
-(doorbell rings)

38:36.220 --> 38:37.210
-Better be you, Vic.

38:42.150 --> 38:44.160
-(cork pops) -To The Bunker Bar.

38:44.170 --> 38:46.020
-Both: To The Bunker Bar!

38:46.030 --> 38:47.160
-Start of something new, Charlie boy.

38:49.190 --> 38:52.100
-I'm Lieutenant Carlito Blanco.

38:53.130 --> 38:56.110
Nobody move, nobody get hurt.

38:56.120 --> 38:58.150
-Dad? What's going on?

38:58.160 --> 39:00.070
-I'm okay, son. I'm okay.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.050
-What do you want, pig?

39:06.050 --> 39:08.130
-Would you care to explain,  Senor Hill?

39:12.110 --> 39:13.130
-What have you done?

39:13.140 --> 39:15.080
-I was doing it for you, Albert.

39:15.090 --> 39:16.220
For all of us.

39:16.230 --> 39:18.130
Just went a bit sideways on me, that's all--

39:18.140 --> 39:19.160
-Doing it for me? You know what, Dad?

39:19.170 --> 39:20.190
I didn't need your help.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.070
We got the investment, all right?

39:22.080 --> 39:23.040
We were gonna be okay!

39:23.050 --> 39:25.100
-I'll make it right, Albert. I'll make it right.

39:25.110 --> 39:26.140
-Blanco: Please shut up.

39:26.150 --> 39:28.110
The way you talk like you all have stones

39:28.120 --> 39:29.100
in your mouths.

39:29.110 --> 39:31.170
-(in Spanish)

39:31.180 --> 39:32.140
-Man: Wait, wait.

39:37.210 --> 39:39.210
-You tell him we ain't got nothing to do with this mess.

39:39.220 --> 39:41.140
You tell him we're a couple of patrons

39:41.150 --> 39:42.200
enjoying a quiet drink

39:42.210 --> 39:45.170
and I will fucking lose my temper

39:45.180 --> 39:48.040
if he doesn't take his hands off my hard case.

39:54.120 --> 39:55.140
-Now listen here.

39:55.150 --> 39:56.150
-(gunshot) -Oh!

40:04.030 --> 40:05.060
-I never liked him.

40:06.110 --> 40:09.080
That's, uh... He's very controlling.

40:14.230 --> 40:17.080
-So, the Hill gang,

40:17.090 --> 40:20.060
the East London Locos.

40:20.070 --> 40:22.010
You can see I'm not a good cop.

40:23.040 --> 40:27.030
I'm a bad cop, and San Toledo is my  pueblo.

40:27.040 --> 40:30.010
The only reason I'm not gonna kill all of you is that

40:30.020 --> 40:31.210
I could use a crew with your skill set

40:31.220 --> 40:34.070
on a little project of mine.

40:34.080 --> 40:36.120
You're all gonna work for me

40:36.130 --> 40:38.070
starting  manana.

40:40.010 --> 40:43.090
And, this place is my property now

40:43.100 --> 40:44.190
and anything else I want to take.

40:44.200 --> 40:47.150
Let's call it the price of admission.

40:49.210 --> 40:51.220
We clear on this, Mr. Hill?

40:51.230 --> 40:54.040
-Hills don't work for nobody. -Dad, shut up.

40:54.050 --> 40:55.120
-(Blanco chuckles)

40:56.230 --> 40:58.190
Listen to your son, Vic.

40:58.200 --> 41:03.050
Or would you like to know how your wife Lily feels about it?

41:03.060 --> 41:04.110
Would you like me to ask her?

41:04.120 --> 41:05.200
-What have you done with my wife?

41:05.210 --> 41:07.180
-(chuckles) -Where is she?

41:09.210 --> 41:13.200
-With a pretty blonde girl in the back of my van.

41:13.210 --> 41:16.060
-You leave them alone, do you hear me?

41:16.070 --> 41:17.170
-Vic: Don't you dare touch them.

41:20.080 --> 41:22.050
-Expect a call in the morning.

41:28.050 --> 41:29.120
The Bunker Bar...

41:30.150 --> 41:31.150
I like the name.

41:33.160 --> 41:35.230
But it could do with a lick of paint.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.070
-(laughing)

41:38.080 --> 41:39.130
-(blows kiss)

41:39.140 --> 41:41.170
