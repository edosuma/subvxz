WEBVTT

00:01.133 --> 00:03.122
Mayhem Global?
What do we know about them?

00:03.148 --> 00:04.681
They got their hands
in a little bit of everything...

00:04.717 --> 00:06.917
construction, import/export,
fracking, real estate,

00:06.953 --> 00:08.352
party supplies, T-shirts,

00:08.387 --> 00:10.321
culturally-insensitive
Halloween costumes,

00:10.356 --> 00:12.189
and all the healthcare in Louisiana.

00:12.225 --> 00:15.854
So, Mayhem Global hires
Duran to hack Meet'N'Cheat.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.410
She draws us in.

00:17.410 --> 00:20.069
Then she hacks us from the inside.
But why?

00:20.070 --> 00:21.934
As soon as we get
Mayor Perry out of there

00:21.970 --> 00:23.536
and elect Dick Dreyfuss,

00:23.571 --> 00:25.104
we can start to make real change.

00:25.140 --> 00:26.539
Who the hell are these people?

00:26.574 --> 00:28.007
Mayhem Global. Mayhem Global.

00:28.043 --> 00:29.509
Mayhem Global. Mayhem Global.

00:29.544 --> 00:31.110
- Mayhem Global.
- Mayhem Global.

00:31.146 --> 00:32.645
I am Mayhem Global.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

01:51.194 --> 01:53.326
Geils! Tribeca! Get in here!

01:57.665 --> 01:59.398
Where's Tribeca? She's late again.

01:59.434 --> 02:00.700
That's three tardies this week.

02:00.735 --> 02:02.335
One more, and she can't
go to the aquarium.

02:02.370 --> 02:04.070
I just don't know what's up with her.

02:04.105 --> 02:06.973
We find 50 kilos of cocaine
at this drug dealer's house.

02:07.008 --> 02:07.254
Yeah.

02:07.254 --> 02:10.048
And I say, "That's a lot
of snow for Los Angeles."

02:10.074 --> 02:11.065
- Nice.
- Killer line.

02:11.066 --> 02:12.672
I nailed the timing and everything.

02:12.703 --> 02:13.432
She gives me nothing.

02:13.468 --> 02:15.335
Geils, let me explain something to you.

02:15.370 --> 02:18.271
In every cop's life,
they go through a phase

02:18.306 --> 02:20.489
where they feel like
the system doesn't work.

02:20.515 --> 02:21.888
The bad guys get away,

02:21.889 --> 02:23.832
and it feels like there's nothing
the police can do about it.

02:23.858 --> 02:26.626
I think I saw a documentary
about this on PDTV.

02:26.668 --> 02:28.317
Alan Thicke narrated it.

02:30.162 --> 02:32.170
She's got things going on
in her body right now

02:32.196 --> 02:33.809
that even she doesn't understand.

02:33.835 --> 02:35.635
Here.

02:35.670 --> 02:37.870
"The Changing Badge."
Thanks, Lieutenant.

02:37.906 --> 02:39.023
Sorry I'm late.

02:39.023 --> 02:41.523
The, uh, thing wasn't working.

02:42.901 --> 02:44.895
Anyway, a graphic
designer's been murdered.

02:44.921 --> 02:46.132
- So? Good riddance.
- No, no.

02:46.168 --> 02:47.113
We still have to investigate it,

02:47.114 --> 02:49.439
no matter how personally
despicable we find them.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.694
So, let me guess... We
go through the motions

02:51.695 --> 02:53.360
of capturing the killer,

02:53.396 --> 02:55.560
and once we have him, we let
him off on a technicality?

02:55.561 --> 02:57.575
"Even though you know
your partner's changing,

02:57.576 --> 02:59.609
she might not know she's changing."

03:00.159 --> 03:02.414
Get down to the graphic designer's loft,

03:02.440 --> 03:04.041
figure out who killed him.

03:04.135 --> 03:06.149
Also, find out what the
parking's like down there

03:06.184 --> 03:07.483
and what they're gonna list it for.

03:12.968 --> 03:14.231
So, I was thinking
maybe after the crime,

03:14.257 --> 03:15.258
we could get a drink together.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.642
Oh, yeah, I have a lot
of stuff going on right now,

03:17.668 --> 03:19.462
so maybe some other crime?

03:22.536 --> 03:23.726
What are we looking at, Scholls?

03:23.765 --> 03:25.437
Victim's name is Sebastian Elsworth.

03:25.463 --> 03:26.438
Graphic designer.

03:26.464 --> 03:28.568
Worked mainly in the
advertising space...

03:28.569 --> 03:30.038
posters, labels, coupons...

03:30.421 --> 03:31.995
though he won't need
to back up his work anymore

03:31.996 --> 03:33.396
because he just got sent to the cloud.

03:35.534 --> 03:38.135
Upstairs neighbor's a trombone player.

03:38.170 --> 03:40.570
- Blunt-force trauma to the head?
- Yes.

03:40.606 --> 03:42.305
We haven't been able
to recover the murder weapon,

03:42.341 --> 03:43.740
but I'll never stop loving you.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.144
Checked his computer. Upstanding guy.

03:47.179 --> 03:50.180
Doesn't share his Netflix
password, pays for his porn,

03:50.215 --> 03:52.015
has a good relationship
with most of his clients,

03:52.050 --> 03:54.284
including the Mayor Perry campaign.

03:54.319 --> 03:57.294
Don't tell me this has to do with
Mayhem Global and the election.

03:57.450 --> 03:58.726
I have no idea.

03:58.793 --> 04:01.628
You said he had a good relationship
with most of his clients.

04:01.663 --> 04:03.129
That means the majority.

04:03.694 --> 04:05.198
There was a long, angry back-and-forth

04:05.233 --> 04:07.158
between Elsworth and an Alistair Cook

04:07.184 --> 04:08.768
who owns a local microbrewery.

04:08.803 --> 04:12.168
"Dr. McBadbones Old Fashioned
Crazy Style Triple Brewed Lager."

04:12.169 --> 04:14.737
Seems Cook wasn't too happy
with Elsworth's design,

04:14.763 --> 04:16.302
so refused to pay him.

04:16.338 --> 04:17.837
E-mails got pretty heated.

04:17.873 --> 04:20.339
In one, he called him
a "ducking armhole,"

04:20.375 --> 04:21.608
which I'm quite sure was autocorrected

04:21.642 --> 04:23.343
for something else.

04:23.378 --> 04:25.578
Let's have forensics search
the area for the murder weapon,

04:25.614 --> 04:27.416
and I'll go talk to Alistair Cook...

04:28.136 --> 04:28.856
I guess.

04:30.510 --> 04:31.778
What's up with her?

04:32.950 --> 04:33.785
Oh.

04:33.832 --> 04:35.698
Hoffman went through that whole thing.

04:36.123 --> 04:37.801
Do the worksheets in the back.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.157
They really help.

04:39.192 --> 04:40.742
Thanks.

04:41.409 --> 04:43.419
Want to go interview
this microbrewery guy?

04:43.455 --> 04:46.589
I got a thing I got to do,
but can you cover me?

04:46.625 --> 04:49.759
Of course. No problem.

04:49.795 --> 04:52.362
Oh, it looks like a beautiful sunset.

04:52.397 --> 04:55.031
I see a sickly orphan
sleeping next to a dead cow.

04:55.945 --> 04:57.733
All right. See you around.

05:05.967 --> 05:08.325
I hired the guy to make
labels for my beer.

05:09.735 --> 05:11.551
They were six weeks late,
and they were terrible,

05:11.551 --> 05:13.086
so, yeah, I was a little aggravated.

05:13.112 --> 05:14.323
A little aggravated?

05:14.332 --> 05:16.529
The title of your e-mail said,
"I'm very aggravated."

05:16.555 --> 05:18.922
Okay, very aggravated,
but I'm a small business owner.

05:18.957 --> 05:20.997
I can't afford setbacks like that.

05:22.368 --> 05:24.167
I've spent 18 years
of my life perfecting

05:24.168 --> 05:27.618
Dr. McBadbones Old Fashioned
Crazy Style Triple Brewed Lager,

05:28.138 --> 05:32.841
and this guy sends me a
label that looks like this.

05:33.572 --> 05:35.043
The skeleton's drinking beer,

05:35.078 --> 05:36.644
and it's all leaking out his ribcage

05:36.680 --> 05:37.812
'cause he's got no organs.

05:37.848 --> 05:39.881
Huh. That's awesome.

05:40.647 --> 05:41.351
Oh.

05:42.616 --> 05:43.882
Oh!

05:44.121 --> 05:45.382
That's pretty amazing.

05:46.123 --> 05:47.622
I guess I was pretty out of line

05:47.657 --> 05:49.394
when I called him a "ducking armhole."

05:50.694 --> 05:52.242
Mr. Cook, where were you last night?

05:52.268 --> 05:54.011
- I was in "Oklahoma!"
- Which part?

05:54.042 --> 05:56.643
Understudy for Curly McLain,
but I like to be there.

05:56.669 --> 05:58.636
- I'm gonna need to see a playbill.
- Oh, sure.

05:58.671 --> 06:01.907
Let me just drop
everything and go find it.

06:01.963 --> 06:02.807
Oh, wait.

06:02.842 --> 06:04.542
I don't have time for that

06:04.577 --> 06:07.712
'cause I got to be here
and do everything myself.

06:08.610 --> 06:10.381
You know 9 out of 10 small businesses

06:10.416 --> 06:12.565
fail in their first 100 years?

06:14.520 --> 06:16.654
I'll get you your playbill, Detective.

06:17.980 --> 06:19.523
You want to give me a hand with this?

06:19.523 --> 06:21.223
Yeah, sure.

06:26.996 --> 06:27.970
Thanks.

06:35.238 --> 06:37.071
Seems like the beer guy's
story checked out.

06:37.106 --> 06:38.353
Cool.

06:38.354 --> 06:40.496
I'm thinking of bringing in
the neighbor this afternoon...

06:40.496 --> 06:43.397
- the trombone player?
- Yeah, it makes sense.

06:43.433 --> 06:44.865
You all right?

06:44.901 --> 06:46.701
Mm-hmm.

07:14.235 --> 07:15.930
You sure you don't want
to tell me anything?

07:15.931 --> 07:17.865
Nope. Feeling great.

07:17.866 --> 07:21.067
Got a great job that actually
makes a difference in the world.

07:21.103 --> 07:25.138
It's really clear who the good
guys are and the bad guys are.

07:25.173 --> 07:27.516
I'm the luckiest girl in the world.

07:42.157 --> 07:43.823
Hey, thanks for doing this, man.

07:43.859 --> 07:46.159
I know it's short notice,
but Tribeca took off early.

07:46.194 --> 07:47.373
No problem, bro.

07:47.374 --> 07:50.062
Thanksgiving's not a big
deal in my family, anyway.

07:51.178 --> 07:52.577
All right, Sousa.

07:52.613 --> 07:54.713
Where were you on the night
that happened last night?

07:54.748 --> 07:55.614
I was home.

07:55.649 --> 07:56.648
- Alone?
- Alone?

07:56.683 --> 07:57.749
Uh, sorry.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.111
- Alone?
- Alone?

07:59.146 --> 08:00.112
You... You go.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.082
Alone?

08:01.257 --> 08:03.190
No. I was with my trombone, Todd.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.716
And what is your relationship
with Sebastian Elsworth?

08:05.886 --> 08:08.426
- Honestly?
- If that's how you want to play it.

08:08.483 --> 08:09.749
He drove me insane...

08:09.775 --> 08:11.972
graphic designing all day, all night.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.693
Click, click, click.
Mouse, mouse, mouse.

08:14.729 --> 08:17.551
Prrrrr-int! Prrrrr-int!

08:17.747 --> 08:19.899
I could barely hear myself
practice my trombone.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.939
- So he made you pretty angry.
- He sure did.

08:21.940 --> 08:23.614
Angry enough to go
downstairs and hit him

08:23.640 --> 08:24.870
in the head with your blunt instrument?

08:24.871 --> 08:26.870
Definitely that angry.
See, this guy gets it.

08:26.905 --> 08:31.508
Oh. Wait. You think I killed
Elsworth with my trombone?

08:31.543 --> 08:34.644
You guys have any idea how much
a Nobbingsly trombone costs?

08:34.669 --> 08:35.567
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:35.567 --> 08:36.251
How much?

08:36.634 --> 08:38.659
Well, it would depend on
what year the Toppings...

08:38.695 --> 08:40.461
Nobbingsly... Trombone was made.

08:40.496 --> 08:44.135
It was a 1961 plated-brass
Nobbingsly Futura 605.

08:44.160 --> 08:47.963
$53,684.45.

08:47.999 --> 08:49.665
All right, so you know your Nobbingsly.

08:49.701 --> 08:51.801
So you also know that it
would be ridiculous for me

08:51.836 --> 08:54.533
to risk damaging it by hitting
Elsworth in the head,

08:54.534 --> 08:57.318
even though that graphic
designer deserved it.

08:57.357 --> 08:58.117
Are we done here?

08:58.118 --> 08:59.392
I have a huge performance tomorrow

08:59.393 --> 09:00.958
where a man's joke is gonna fall flat.

09:00.994 --> 09:03.428
I don't think the neighbor
had anything to do with it.

09:03.463 --> 09:05.496
And the beer guy's story checks out.

09:05.532 --> 09:08.538
So we've got a murder
without a murderer.

09:09.469 --> 09:11.169
Well, no one can say we didn't try.

09:11.204 --> 09:12.513
See you Monday.

09:13.131 --> 09:15.406
Looks like Scholls has a rifle.

09:15.442 --> 09:17.208
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee...

09:17.243 --> 09:18.810
One of my techs found
this in the Dumpster

09:18.845 --> 09:20.478
next to Elsworth's apartment.

09:20.513 --> 09:22.989
There's traces of blood and
hair that match the victim.

09:23.130 --> 09:23.948
But here's the interesting part.

09:23.983 --> 09:25.650
I went to check it into evidence,

09:25.659 --> 09:28.005
was told someone checked it
out of evidence yesterday.

09:28.031 --> 09:28.742
Who checked it out?

09:28.743 --> 09:30.043
That would tell us exactly who did it.

09:30.079 --> 09:31.545
A. Tribeca.

09:36.203 --> 09:37.995
Please tell me it's not Angie Tribeca.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.361
I'm afraid so.

09:39.395 --> 09:41.095
The Angie Tribeca that works here?

09:41.130 --> 09:42.096
Yep.

09:46.335 --> 09:47.768
Damn it.

09:55.552 --> 09:56.752
Angie.

09:59.109 --> 10:00.775
Angie, are you there?

10:13.723 --> 10:15.089
Tribeca, I have to talk to you.

10:15.125 --> 10:17.458
- Where are you going?
- I ran out of milk.

10:17.494 --> 10:19.928
You have a packed bag
and a plane ticket.

10:19.963 --> 10:22.697
Me gusto la leche de Mexico.

10:22.732 --> 10:24.399
Is there something
you'd like to say to me?

10:24.434 --> 10:27.235
Maybe about Sebastian Elsworth,
the graphic designer?

10:27.270 --> 10:29.037
Maybe... I don't know... you killed him?

10:33.443 --> 10:35.743
Did I?

10:37.740 --> 10:39.060
It would seem that way.

10:40.517 --> 10:43.084
You signed the murder weapon
out of evidence yesterday.

10:43.119 --> 10:46.627
Then it somehow got Elsworth's
brains smeared all over it.

10:46.627 --> 10:48.257
I've only been at this for 15 years,

10:48.258 --> 10:50.724
but that's what we call
an open-and-shut case.

10:51.926 --> 10:54.604
It's the kind of case you and I
used to crack by 10:00 a.m.

10:54.605 --> 10:56.537
and ride roller coasters all afternoon.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.938
Well, I guess you have no
choice but to arrest me, Jay.

10:58.939 --> 11:00.471
No, no, no, no, no.

11:00.506 --> 11:02.606
You want to tell me
what's going on, Angela?

11:03.536 --> 11:04.537
I'm afraid I can't do that.

11:04.538 --> 11:06.845
Does this have to do with Mayhem Global?

11:06.940 --> 11:08.474
Does this have to do with the election?

11:08.509 --> 11:11.327
Is it because Elsworth
was designing posters

11:11.353 --> 11:12.479
for the Perry campaign?

11:12.480 --> 11:14.686
You're a good detective, Geils.
You'll figure it out.

11:14.712 --> 11:15.950
This isn't you, Angie.

11:15.985 --> 11:17.718
I know you've been going
through something lately,

11:17.753 --> 11:19.584
but you've got your whole
career ahead of you.

11:19.610 --> 11:23.040
And even though we never see it,
we're raising a baby together.

11:25.102 --> 11:25.876
Fine.

11:28.117 --> 11:29.947
This isn't as kinky as I imagined it,

11:29.973 --> 11:31.339
but I'm gonna cuff you.

11:35.358 --> 11:37.024
You have the right to...

11:37.953 --> 11:39.160
You know the rest.

11:42.064 --> 11:44.098
Hello, Tribeca.

11:44.133 --> 11:45.000
Remember me?

11:45.001 --> 11:46.868
Yeah. Hey.

11:46.903 --> 11:47.969
Abigail Liukin.

11:48.004 --> 11:48.970
Right.

11:49.005 --> 11:50.738
From... college?

11:50.774 --> 11:51.973
Internal Affairs.

11:52.008 --> 11:53.842
Yes! Right.

11:53.877 --> 11:55.343
Hello, Liukin. Hm.

11:55.378 --> 11:58.079
I knew you were a dirty cop
the moment I laid eyes on you.

11:58.114 --> 12:00.645
The water in my building
was shut off that day.

12:01.812 --> 12:02.886
Tribeca.

12:03.086 --> 12:05.490
I just wanted you to know
if there's anything you need...

12:05.516 --> 12:07.021
I know, Lieutenant. I know.

12:07.057 --> 12:09.791
No. I was gonna say we can't
really help you right now.

12:09.826 --> 12:11.059
You're pretty toxic.

12:15.025 --> 12:18.612
Even if you did kill that guy,
you're still my girl.

12:18.862 --> 12:19.366
You hear me?

12:19.402 --> 12:22.637
You're still... my girl.

12:22.672 --> 12:24.706
Thanks, Tanner. That means a lot.

12:29.656 --> 12:31.483
He's not too good with goodbyes.

12:41.137 --> 12:42.102
Ow!

12:43.442 --> 12:45.068
- Ow!
- All right. Okay.

12:45.068 --> 12:45.900
My bad.

12:45.935 --> 12:46.627
Oh!

12:46.653 --> 12:48.062
Just... I'll do it.

12:50.906 --> 12:52.688
- Oh!
- Aah!

12:53.110 --> 12:53.657
Oh!

13:06.576 --> 13:07.825
Is that your statement?

13:09.325 --> 13:09.879
Yep.

13:10.896 --> 13:12.796
We've got you, Tribeca.

13:12.995 --> 13:14.128
You signed out the murder weapon

13:14.163 --> 13:15.896
yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m.

13:15.931 --> 13:17.998
It was found near the
crime scene in a Dumpster

13:18.033 --> 13:21.401
along with some of your hair,
a to-do list in your handwriting

13:21.437 --> 13:22.936
with "murder" crossed off,

13:22.972 --> 13:24.938
and a sandwich with a
bite taken out of it

13:24.974 --> 13:26.540
that we matched to your dental records,

13:26.575 --> 13:30.878
and this vanity license plate.

13:30.913 --> 13:32.546
Want to try your statement again?

13:32.581 --> 13:33.730
No, thanks.

13:34.950 --> 13:38.352
Do you have any idea
how satisfying it's gonna be

13:38.387 --> 13:39.653
for me to put you away?

13:39.679 --> 13:40.854
Mm, I don't know.

13:40.890 --> 13:42.122
Like an 8?

13:42.158 --> 13:45.037
Try 9... 1/2.

13:45.063 --> 13:46.888
Well, then, this is your lucky day.

13:46.929 --> 13:49.329
Play all the games you want, Tribeca,

13:49.365 --> 13:51.598
but you're gonna tell me what
you know about Mayhem Global

13:51.634 --> 13:53.818
and their connection to
this mayoral election...

13:53.867 --> 13:56.479
Because if you don't, so help me God,

13:56.505 --> 13:59.239
I will unleash holy hellfire on you.

13:59.275 --> 14:02.876
I will roll up the Constitution
and beat you with it.

14:02.912 --> 14:07.014
And by the end, you'll be
crying and wishing you...

14:09.552 --> 14:10.984
Take her away.

14:14.590 --> 14:15.956
Come with me.

14:27.937 --> 14:28.969
What are we gonna do?

14:28.969 --> 14:31.202
If I knew what to do,
I'd be doing it, Geils.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.337
We got to do something.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.005
But what? What do we do?

14:34.040 --> 14:36.007
- Something.
- Agreed! But what?

14:37.042 --> 14:38.610
- Maybe...
- Pizza's here.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.961
Pizza, pizza.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.196
Anything else, Lieutenant?

14:58.231 --> 14:59.230
That'll be all, Stan.

15:01.624 --> 15:03.268
Let's just say she did do it.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.236
It was a graphic designer.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.939
- Victimless crime.
- She didn't do it.

15:07.974 --> 15:09.374
Do you think if Tribeca has a rifle,

15:09.409 --> 15:11.099
she's gonna hit someone
in the head with it

15:11.099 --> 15:13.399
and then throw it in the Dumpster
right next to the building?

15:13.400 --> 15:15.714
It's like someone's framing her,
and she's going along with it.

15:15.740 --> 15:16.931
- Why?
- I don't know.

15:16.966 --> 15:18.232
Maybe her childhood fantasy

15:18.267 --> 15:20.067
was to be sentenced to life in prison.

15:20.103 --> 15:21.368
No, that's not right.

15:21.404 --> 15:22.870
She said she wanted to be a magician.

15:22.905 --> 15:24.625
Yeah. So she gets to prison

15:24.696 --> 15:27.074
so she can plan the
greatest escape in history.

15:27.110 --> 15:28.409
I feel like we're getting offtrack.

15:28.444 --> 15:30.010
The only way we're
gonna clear Tribeca's name

15:30.046 --> 15:31.245
is to exonerate her,

15:31.280 --> 15:33.013
and that means we have to find out

15:33.049 --> 15:35.449
who actually killed Sebastian Elsworth.

15:36.497 --> 15:37.384
We're on it, Lieutenant.

15:37.420 --> 15:38.986
And this time, it's personal.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.956
- Yeah.
- Wait a minute.

15:41.991 --> 15:44.325
It really is personal this time

15:44.360 --> 15:46.494
because I have a connection to Tribeca

15:46.529 --> 15:48.462
and she's the focus of the case.

15:48.498 --> 15:50.131
Wow. You're right.

15:50.166 --> 15:52.199
This case really is personal for you.

15:53.503 --> 15:54.568
Wait a minute.

15:54.604 --> 15:56.470
I know Tribeca, as well,

15:56.506 --> 16:00.307
and what happens to her affects my life.

16:02.078 --> 16:03.811
This time, it's personal.

16:03.846 --> 16:07.223
Guys, this is gonna blow you
away, but I'm her boss.

16:07.223 --> 16:08.198
She's my employee.

16:08.199 --> 16:11.266
No matter what the turnout,
I have an emotional stake in it.

16:11.301 --> 16:12.534
This time, it's personal.

16:12.569 --> 16:14.169
You guys mind if I mop the office?

16:14.204 --> 16:16.271
Sure. We were just heading out
to clear Tribeca's name.

16:16.306 --> 16:17.539
- Angie Tribeca?
- Yeah.

16:17.574 --> 16:19.341
One time, I locked my keys in my car,

16:19.376 --> 16:21.042
and she helped get them out.

16:21.078 --> 16:22.410
I owe her everything.

16:22.446 --> 16:24.146
This is personal.

16:24.181 --> 16:26.581
Let's go.

17:30.865 --> 17:32.414
Dr. Scholls, is this a bad time?

17:33.550 --> 17:34.876
No, it's fine. What's up?

17:34.908 --> 17:36.251
Here.

17:36.286 --> 17:39.020
I think whoever murdered
our graphic designer

17:39.056 --> 17:40.956
meant to use the shootie end of the gun.

17:40.991 --> 17:42.924
He had a perch across the street.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.559
You want me to help you save Tribeca?

17:44.595 --> 17:46.428
I want you to help me catch a murderer.

17:47.635 --> 17:49.025
I actually thought with
her out of the way,

17:49.051 --> 17:50.265
we'd have a shot,

17:50.300 --> 17:53.168
that her life sentence could
be our happily ever after.

17:53.203 --> 17:55.370
Monica, I'm sure this doesn't
make up for anything,

17:55.405 --> 17:56.671
but I do care about you.

17:56.707 --> 17:58.106
Enough with the lies, Geils.

17:58.141 --> 17:59.641
What we had was real.

17:59.676 --> 18:00.976
- Is that a lie?
- Yeah.

18:01.011 --> 18:02.588
Sorry. Old habits.

18:02.588 --> 18:05.230
But I only lied to you because I
knew the truth would hurt you.

18:05.256 --> 18:06.555
That's what good guys do.

18:07.648 --> 18:09.071
I guess I just wished that, one time,

18:09.071 --> 18:10.904
you'd looked at me the
way you look at her.

18:10.938 --> 18:12.671
That's it?

18:13.169 --> 18:14.029
I can do that.

18:28.384 --> 18:29.088
She's so lucky.

18:30.658 --> 18:32.224
This is impossible.

18:32.260 --> 18:33.425
The fingerprints belong to a cop

18:33.461 --> 18:34.593
who's been dead for 10 years...

18:34.629 --> 18:36.228
a Sergeant Edward Pepper.

18:36.264 --> 18:38.697
That's Tribeca's old fiancé.

18:38.733 --> 18:40.432
His name's come up a lot recently

18:40.468 --> 18:42.401
for someone who's supposed to be dead.

18:42.436 --> 18:45.070
I mean, dead means dead,
never coming back.

19:50.581 --> 19:52.881
I know why Tribeca's
letting herself be framed.

19:52.915 --> 19:55.496
She's gonna hook up
with Diane Duran in prison.

19:55.497 --> 19:57.396
Tanner, get a webcam in there.

19:57.432 --> 20:01.349
Geils, reserve the domain name
GirlCopsBehindBars.com.

20:01.375 --> 20:03.612
No. I meant "hook up"
in a conspiracy sense.

20:03.638 --> 20:05.571
I think Tribeca's gone to the dark side.

20:05.607 --> 20:08.774
I think that she and Duran
and Sergeant Eddie Pepper

20:08.810 --> 20:11.510
are conspiring to kill Mayor Joe Perry.

20:14.949 --> 20:17.683
Gentlemen...

20:17.719 --> 20:19.986
we have an assassination to stop.
