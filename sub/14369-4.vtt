{\an8}RADIO ANNOUNCER:
Good morning, Sheltered Shrubs.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.607
{\an8}6:45 on what promises
to be a glorious day.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.025
{\an8}Good-looking sunrise.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.401
{\an8}Did you see it?

01:08.485 --> 01:11.362
{\an8}High today in the mid-70s
should feel pretty darn good.

01:11.446 --> 01:14.407
{\an8}We got our commercial-free
morning block coming right up.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.826
{\an8}Oh, and this just in:
Ginger Foutley returns

01:16.910 --> 01:19.496
{\an8}to Lucky Junior High today.

01:19.579 --> 01:20.330
(<i> radio alarm goes off</i> )

01:20.413 --> 01:21.873
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my
gosh! Oh, my gosh!

01:21.956 --> 01:25.084
Today's the day
we've been waiting for!

01:25.168 --> 01:28.296
{\an1}Oh, I can't wait to say
those three little words.

01:28.379 --> 01:30.632
Welcome back, Ginger.

01:30.715 --> 01:34.219
I really missed you... honest.

01:34.302 --> 01:35.887
(<i> spits</i> )

01:35.970 --> 01:37.013
I don't think
I'm ever going to get

01:37.096 --> 01:39.057
the taste of that lie
out of my mouth.

01:39.140 --> 01:42.352
Oh, I'd better hurry,
I don't want to miss...

01:42.435 --> 01:43.853
{\an5}Ginger Foutley addressing
those ugly rumors

01:43.937 --> 01:46.648
that have been
spreading about her.

01:46.731 --> 01:49.359
Hello? What rock have
you been living under?

01:49.442 --> 01:53.196
Of course, there have been ugly
rumors spreading about her.

01:53.279 --> 01:56.574
I should know-- I'm the one
who's been spreading them.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.369
Okay, now, when we see her,
one of us should hug her

01:59.452 --> 02:01.955
{\an1}while the other one says,
"Welcome home, Ginger.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.206
We really missed you."

02:03.289 --> 02:04.249
{\an1}Agreed.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.167
So who should take
the first hug?

02:06.251 --> 02:08.211
{\an1}What if we hug
and greet together?

02:08.294 --> 02:09.753
You mean
at the same time?

02:09.838 --> 02:11.506
I'm asking.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.132
No, we might mess up
our outfit

02:13.216 --> 02:13.800
or something.

02:13.883 --> 02:16.219
It has to be
one hug at a time.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.178
{\an1}Then I think
it should be you.

02:19.138 --> 02:22.475
Okay, now, when we get
to Foutley's locker,

02:22.559 --> 02:23.935
I'll throw her
a dirty look,

02:24.018 --> 02:26.312
and you say,
"Welcome home, Ginger,"

02:26.396 --> 02:28.064
real sarcastic like.

02:28.147 --> 02:29.691
{\an1}Maybe I should throw her
the dirty look,

02:29.774 --> 02:31.901
and you should say...

02:31.985 --> 02:32.902
That's insane.

02:32.986 --> 02:33.695
Everybody knows
my dirty looks

02:33.778 --> 02:35.488
are the dirtiest.

02:35.572 --> 02:36.072
Ow!

02:36.155 --> 02:37.824
{\an1}Look where
you're going!

02:37.907 --> 02:38.908
Sorry, Miranda.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.910
There
she is.

02:40.994 --> 02:41.452
Ginger!
Wel-welcome...

02:41.536 --> 02:43.413
Hug?

02:43.496 --> 02:45.081
Dodie, first,
then Macie...

02:45.164 --> 02:46.916
{\an1}MIRANDA:
Really glad to...

02:47.000 --> 02:48.293
{\an1}Foutley?!

02:48.376 --> 02:50.587
Totally dissed.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.464
I don't think
she even saw us.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.384
Who does Foutley think she is?

02:59.095 --> 03:01.097
{\an1}GINGER:
You guys, over here!

03:01.180 --> 03:02.682
(<i> girls muttering</i> )

03:02.765 --> 03:04.100
{\an5}Hi.

03:02.765 --> 03:04.100
Hi!

03:04.183 --> 03:05.560
Oh...

03:05.643 --> 03:07.854
I'm really glad
to see you guys.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.022
{\an1}Hey,
what's up, kids?

03:09.105 --> 03:10.815
See you're wearing
Darren's shirt there.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.818
{\an1}Actually,
I haven't taken it off

03:13.902 --> 03:15.445
since he sent it to me.

03:15.528 --> 03:15.862
Gross.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.697
(<i> chuckles</i> )

03:20.825 --> 03:23.202
So, we tried
to surprise you

03:23.286 --> 03:25.622
at your locker
this morning.

03:25.705 --> 03:26.039
Really?

03:26.122 --> 03:26.623
Yeah, but I guess

03:26.706 --> 03:28.499
we were too late.

03:28.583 --> 03:29.626
Oh.

03:29.709 --> 03:30.585
We saw you
in the hallway, though.

03:30.668 --> 03:32.337
You did?

03:32.420 --> 03:33.922
But you didn't see us.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.214
Oh.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.549
{\an1}Well, I...
see you now.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.301
Yeah.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.094
{\an4}ZORSKI:
Let's move inside,
people.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.055
{\an1}Can we have Ginger Foutley
up on the stage please?

03:42.138 --> 03:44.307
Well, I guess I'd better
get up there, huh?

03:44.390 --> 03:46.225
Sure.

03:46.309 --> 03:46.601
You'd better,
yep...

03:46.684 --> 03:48.436
get up there.

03:48.519 --> 03:50.146
Um...

03:50.229 --> 03:53.900
so... see you
at lunch, huh?

03:54.317 --> 03:55.985
Where's he going?

03:56.069 --> 03:59.989
MIRANDA:
Ooh, Ginger, yoohoo!

04:00.073 --> 04:01.658
(<i> gasps</i> )

04:01.741 --> 04:03.409
She did it again.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.536
How am I supposed
to drop the dirty look

04:05.620 --> 04:07.330
if she won't even
make eye contact!?

04:07.413 --> 04:10.667
It's like she doesn't
even notice we exist!

04:10.750 --> 04:12.377
This is getting
way out of hand.

04:22.428 --> 04:23.346
(<i> squawks</i> )

04:25.473 --> 04:27.475
One, two, three... spit!

04:39.946 --> 04:40.863
{\an3}Oh...

04:40.947 --> 04:41.572
I win!

04:41.656 --> 04:42.615
(<i> all gasp</i> )

04:42.699 --> 04:44.617
Polly Schuster,

04:44.701 --> 04:45.660
enchantress of
the school yard.

04:45.743 --> 04:48.496
I win, Sussman!

04:48.579 --> 04:49.664
Hand them over (<i> squawks</i> ) now!

04:49.747 --> 04:53.126
Oh...

04:53.876 --> 04:56.379
One more game,
Polly,

04:56.462 --> 04:57.880
if you dare.

04:57.964 --> 04:58.840
If I dare?!

04:58.923 --> 05:01.592
I beat you three times.

05:01.676 --> 05:02.760
{\an1}You lost your shoe,
your belt

05:02.844 --> 05:05.388
and your ability to see.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.890
{\an1}What's next,
your self-respect?!

05:07.974 --> 05:08.891
(<i> squawks</i> )

05:08.975 --> 05:09.934
(<i> all gasp</i> )

05:10.018 --> 05:12.729
I've one thing left
to wager with.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.064
It's highly valuable,

05:15.148 --> 05:16.691
and it can't be
store-bought.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.943
You what?!

05:19.027 --> 05:20.903
I lost you
in a bet, Carl.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.072
I'm sorry.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.533
{\an1}You used me...
as a gambling chip?

05:25.616 --> 05:27.076
Yes.

05:27.160 --> 05:27.785
Me, my person?

05:27.869 --> 05:30.413
Yes, Carl, affirmative.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.874
To sum up,
I feel like a toad.

05:32.957 --> 05:33.916
You lost me in a bet.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.295
{\an1}She lost you
in a bet, Carl!

05:37.378 --> 05:38.296
{\an1}Yes! Jeez!

05:38.379 --> 05:39.255
How many times

05:39.338 --> 05:39.756
{\an1}does she have
to say it?!

05:39.839 --> 05:42.133
This is unbelievable.

05:42.216 --> 05:43.760
{\an1}And what happened
to your shoe?

05:43.843 --> 05:45.261
And your glasses?

05:45.344 --> 05:47.597
That's not
important now.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.767
{\an5}What's important
is that you are
now property

05:50.850 --> 05:53.227
{\an5}of Polly Schuster
starting Friday
at the stroke of 3:00

05:53.311 --> 05:56.939
and pretty much through
the weekend, I'm afraid.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.775
"Property of Polly"?

05:58.858 --> 05:59.776
{\an1}What's she going
to do with me?

05:59.859 --> 06:03.446
She's going to force you
to dress up like a bird

06:03.529 --> 06:05.615
and play Parrot World.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.158
"Parrot World"!?

06:07.241 --> 06:09.077
It's a game she made up.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.704
But she has no friends
to play it with.

06:11.788 --> 06:12.789
Polly is obsessed
with birds.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.291
Her whole family is.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.042
That's why
they named her

06:16.125 --> 06:18.961
"Polly (<i> squawks</i> )
Schuster."

06:19.045 --> 06:21.756
Oh, this can't be happening.

06:21.839 --> 06:23.424
But it is, I'm afraid.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.634
And I've only
myself to blame.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.886
Good-bye, Carl.

06:26.969 --> 06:28.596
(<i> sighs</i> )

06:28.679 --> 06:29.639
(<i> grunts</i> )

06:29.722 --> 06:30.973
Noelle!

06:31.057 --> 06:32.600
How will I know
which one's Polly?

06:32.683 --> 06:38.648
She's the one...
who smells like birdseed.

06:40.691 --> 06:42.485
What's he doing up
on stage with her?

06:42.568 --> 06:44.153
It's like she doesn't go
anywhere without him.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.156
{\an1}And their school day
is structured

06:47.240 --> 06:48.658
really differently.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.034
It's more like college.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.578
Are you seeing this?

06:52.662 --> 06:55.915
There's an entire
assembly devoted to her.

06:55.998 --> 06:58.501
Okay, that's it.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.129
We have to knock
her down a notch.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.130
{\an1}Ginger,
let's take one more.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.799
{\an1}Ask her something
embarrassing.

07:04.882 --> 07:07.510
Um, Iris, in the back.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.262
Did you see that?

07:09.345 --> 07:12.765
She totally
snubbed me... again!

07:12.849 --> 07:14.350
Mark my words,

07:14.433 --> 07:16.352
she's going down
like the <i> Titanic.</i>

07:16.435 --> 07:20.815
And the first thing we need
is two extra captains

07:20.898 --> 07:22.024
to help sink the ship.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.652
(<i> laughs evilly</i> )

07:30.908 --> 07:34.537
When I found her, her parka was
red and her lips were blue.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.372
I had to think quickly.

07:36.455 --> 07:37.373
Not only was she in danger,

07:37.456 --> 07:41.169
but it was
a major fashion emergency.

07:41.252 --> 07:43.796
(<i> light applause</i> )

07:43.880 --> 07:45.423
Man, it's nice
to be missed,

07:45.506 --> 07:47.300
but this is getting
embarrassing.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.010
We're really glad
you're here.

07:49.093 --> 07:50.678
Without Darren.

07:50.761 --> 07:52.430
Oh, it's just that
we were hoping

07:52.513 --> 07:53.723
to spend a little
girl time together.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.641
Ladies.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.476
Madame.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.060
GINGER:
Hi, sweetie.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.396
Look-- saved you
my corn.

08:00.479 --> 08:02.398
What if one of us
wanted your corn?

08:02.481 --> 08:03.566
Ever think of that?

08:03.649 --> 08:04.901
MACIE:
Good gravy, woman,

08:04.984 --> 08:06.235
it's a nutritionally-
useless starch.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.197
{\an1}Not the point, Macie,
not the point.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.574
{\an1}It would have been nice
to be offered.

08:11.657 --> 08:14.118
{\an1}Do you want
the corn, Dodie?

08:14.202 --> 08:15.161
Not from you!

08:15.244 --> 08:16.871
From <i> her!</i>

08:16.954 --> 08:18.581
Want it?

08:18.664 --> 08:19.957
No, thank you!

08:20.041 --> 08:21.626
Um... look, guys,

08:21.709 --> 08:23.669
about what we were discussing
before Darren got here,

08:23.753 --> 08:27.256
why don't we do it after school
at my place today?

08:27.340 --> 08:28.007
Just the three of us.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.884
That would be nice.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.135
Thank you very much.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.385
Thank you.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.972
And thank you, both.

08:38.976 --> 08:39.977
What would you do?

08:40.061 --> 08:41.354
Dump her.

08:41.437 --> 08:42.605
{\an1}Dump who?

08:42.688 --> 08:45.107
Noelle-- then you're not
her boyfriend anymore,

08:45.191 --> 08:46.400
and she can't trade you.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.611
{\an1}She didn't exactly
trade me, Hoods.

08:48.694 --> 08:52.198
{\an5}Trade you, lose you,
gamble you away like
a worthless...

08:52.281 --> 08:55.368
And the point is, if I bag out,
I disgrace Noelle.

08:55.451 --> 08:59.080
And becoming property
of Polly isn't disgraceful?

08:59.163 --> 09:01.916
{\an1}Huh, when did you start
wearing deodorant?

09:01.999 --> 09:04.627
Spending the weekend
at my Aunt Myrna's pig farm

09:04.710 --> 09:07.505
means a lot of
physical labor, okay?

09:07.588 --> 09:09.131
Now, can we drop it?

09:09.215 --> 09:10.675
{\an3}Yeah.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.927
Anyhoo, I guess I'll
just serve the time

09:13.010 --> 09:14.345
and chalk
this whole thing up

09:14.428 --> 09:16.806
{\an5}as one of
those crazy things
I did for love.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.141
Just try to keep it below radar,
you know.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.645
Agreed, no one needs to know
that I'll be spending my weekend

09:22.728 --> 09:24.563
in feathers
and a strap-on beak

09:24.647 --> 09:26.607
playing Parrot World with Polly.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.153
{\an1}Isn't this nice
girl time?

09:31.237 --> 09:33.114
{\an1}Just us girls,
the three of us.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.615
{\an3}Yeah.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.033
{\an1}Okay, so tell me
everything

09:36.117 --> 09:37.952
{\an1}starting with
what happened to Thea

09:38.035 --> 09:40.746
{\an4}and ending with how
your hair got back
to normal.

09:40.830 --> 09:41.789
DARREN:
Surprise!

09:41.872 --> 09:43.499
Oops, sorry
to interrupt.

09:43.582 --> 09:45.835
I just wanted a little
advice on something.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.003
{\an1}We were right
in the middle of talking.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.046
{\an5}Take a hike.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.046
Dodie.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.589
Just one quick question, ladies,

09:50.673 --> 09:52.466
and I promise
I'm out of your hair.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.219
See, I'm professing
my undying love for Ginger

09:55.303 --> 09:56.262
on the side
of my canvas hightops,

09:56.345 --> 09:59.223
but which side looks better,

09:59.307 --> 10:02.059
"G+D 4ever" or "D+G 4ever"?

10:02.143 --> 10:04.186
I like the "D+G."

10:04.270 --> 10:06.063
{\an1}Oh, who cares?
Who cares?

10:06.147 --> 10:06.814
{\an1}Who cares?
Who cares?

10:06.897 --> 10:09.150
Who cares?!

10:09.233 --> 10:10.735
Dodie, I care, okay?

10:11.777 --> 10:14.905
{\an1}Look... let's talk
about this later, Darren.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.574
{\an1}We have to finish
catching up

10:16.657 --> 10:18.534
{\an1}and... I need
to talk to Dodie.

10:18.617 --> 10:19.201
Okay, babe.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.871
I'll talk to you later.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.080
You say "bye" first.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.540
{\an1}GINGER:
No...

10:24.623 --> 10:26.042
you say "bye" first.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.168
No,<i> you.</i>

10:27.251 --> 10:29.086
No, you say it.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.630
(<i> door slams</i> )

10:31.714 --> 10:33.549
I guess Dodie
said "bye" first

10:33.632 --> 10:35.885
{\an5}only she did it
without saying
"bye."

10:35.968 --> 10:37.762
You follow?

10:39.555 --> 10:41.766
Who exactly does Darren
Patterson think he is,

10:41.849 --> 10:45.269
planting himself right smack
in the middle of our friendship?

10:45.353 --> 10:48.439
And Ginger is letting him!

10:48.522 --> 10:51.400
I suppose <i> Darren</i> will be in
on our nightly phone calls

10:51.484 --> 10:54.236
and <i> Darren</i> will be consulted
on outfit planning.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.989
If he thinks he's taking over
my territory,

10:57.073 --> 10:58.741
he's got another thing coming.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.951
{\an5}MIRANDA:
I'm with you,
girlfriend.

11:01.035 --> 11:01.911
{\an1}Miranda?

11:01.994 --> 11:02.411
Mipsy?

11:02.495 --> 11:03.496
What are you guys doing,

11:03.579 --> 11:06.290
besides catching up
on dental hygiene?

11:06.374 --> 11:08.876
We're here to join you
in your effort

11:08.959 --> 11:11.212
to kick Darren Patterson
to the curb.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.088
What do you mean?

11:12.171 --> 11:14.298
We know you want him
out of the picture,

11:14.382 --> 11:16.634
{\an1}and you know you want him
out of the picture.

11:16.717 --> 11:17.468
{\an1}The only thing
left to decide...

11:17.551 --> 11:20.638
Is how to get him
out of the picture.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.598
{\an1}I don't want
to betray Ginger.

11:22.681 --> 11:23.474
But she's left
you no choice.

11:23.557 --> 11:26.435
Ever since
she got home, it's...

11:26.519 --> 11:27.937
{\an1}Darren this
and Darren that.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.438
It's almost
as if she has...

11:29.522 --> 11:30.564
Darrenitis?

11:30.648 --> 11:32.274
And I just wish
there was a way

11:32.358 --> 11:33.943
I could give her...

11:34.026 --> 11:34.777
A Darrenectomy?

11:34.860 --> 11:37.279
Wow! It's so easy
to talk to you guys.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.199
{\an1}We take great pride
in that.

11:40.282 --> 11:41.617
Thanks, you two.

11:41.700 --> 11:42.618
I really just want

11:42.701 --> 11:44.286
to get
my best friend back.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.205
We understand, and
we intend to help.

11:46.288 --> 11:47.415
Want to see my room?

11:47.498 --> 11:49.041
We'd like nothing better.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.797
And now it's just
a matter of time

11:54.880 --> 11:58.134
{\an1}before Foutley finds
her little bowl of cherries

11:58.217 --> 12:01.595
has turned into the pits.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.140
Cherry preserves?

12:04.223 --> 12:07.351
Ooh, double drats.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.646
{\an1}DODIE:
Listen, Macie,

12:10.729 --> 12:12.982
if they break up,
things will be normal.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.191
I don't know...

12:14.275 --> 12:15.651
Everyone benefits
in the long run, Lightfoot.

12:15.734 --> 12:18.320
{\an5}Now, the plan is
to get Patterson
to dump Foutley

12:18.404 --> 12:20.865
{\an1}and get back together
with me.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.283
(<i> gasps</i> )

12:22.908 --> 12:25.077
{\an5}Courtney!

12:22.908 --> 12:25.077
{\an1}(<i> gasps</i> )

12:25.744 --> 12:27.496
{\an1}Uh...
we-we were just...

12:27.580 --> 12:29.999
Trying out new hairstyles
with the hand dryer.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.250
(<i> hand dryer blowing</i> )

12:31.333 --> 12:31.917
(<i> gasps</i> )

12:34.253 --> 12:35.171
Innovative, to say the least.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.173
Won't you excuse me?

12:37.256 --> 12:38.799
(<i> hand dryer stops blowing</i> )

12:38.883 --> 12:39.884
(<i> begins blowing</i> )

12:39.967 --> 12:41.969
Meet in
the south stairwell

12:42.052 --> 12:43.179
after lunch.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.473
(<i> hand dryer continues blowing</i> )

12:45.556 --> 12:47.349
{\an1}Everyone knows
what to do.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.476
I pour it on thick,

12:48.559 --> 12:53.105
and you two play
the friend card.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.859
T.G.I.F., gents.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.444
Any big weekend plans?

12:58.527 --> 13:02.740
Hanging with my aunt
and her pigs.

13:02.823 --> 13:04.533
Oh, same old, same old.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.535
Why, whatever does
that mean, Foutley?

13:06.619 --> 13:09.622
{\an1}It means I haven't got
any big plans.

13:09.705 --> 13:12.041
{\an1}I'll probably just sit around
and count my nose hairs.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.876
Dig?

13:13.959 --> 13:17.588
That sounds ducky, Carl,
just ducky.

13:17.671 --> 13:22.051
Or should I say
"birdie"?

13:22.134 --> 13:23.928
(<i> grunting</i> )

13:26.347 --> 13:28.307
{\an5}MIRANDA:
Dropped your
scrunchy.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.560
{\an1}Uh, it's not mine;
it's Ginger's.

13:31.644 --> 13:35.147
Wow! Keeping stuff
in each other's lockers.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.649
Things must be
serious.

13:36.732 --> 13:37.775
Uh... yeah.

13:37.858 --> 13:41.237
{\an1}Too bad things never
got that serious with us.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.490
{\an1}You got something
in your eye, Miranda?

13:44.573 --> 13:46.075
(<i> giggles</i> )

13:46.158 --> 13:47.826
Just you, Shmoobaka.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.578
Well, uh, got to run.

13:49.662 --> 13:50.412
{\an1}See you.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.706
(<i> sighs</i> )

13:56.168 --> 13:58.128
{\an1}She said she called him
last night.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.172
Whomever do you mean?

14:00.256 --> 14:01.590
Fred, that cool guy

14:01.674 --> 14:04.510
who had the hots for her
up at Avalanche Arts.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.262
Why, hello there,
Darren.

14:06.345 --> 14:07.555
Dodie and I did not
see you there

14:07.638 --> 14:10.933
overhearing
our conversation.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.351
{\an3}Hey, D.

14:12.434 --> 14:13.644
Hi.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.064
How's your day?

14:17.147 --> 14:18.399
{\an3}Weird.

14:18.482 --> 14:21.068
{\an1}Miranda just totally
vibed me out at my locker

14:21.151 --> 14:22.236
a few minutes ago.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.654
And she's acting like
she's in love with me.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.240
{\an1}I guarantee
she's just doing it

14:26.323 --> 14:27.908
since she knows
we're together.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.202
{\an1}She's probably just
trying to tick me off.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.245
Oh, really?

14:31.328 --> 14:31.954
Couldn't possibly be

14:32.037 --> 14:34.623
that she actually
likes me, huh?

14:34.707 --> 14:36.292
Darren, that's
not what I...

14:36.375 --> 14:38.627
No, no, after all,
what happened between us

14:38.711 --> 14:40.212
was nowhere near as special

14:40.296 --> 14:42.339
as what happened
between you and Fred.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.007
Fred?

14:43.090 --> 14:45.301
What's he got to do with this?

14:45.384 --> 14:47.011
Ask them!

14:48.053 --> 14:50.097
(<i> groans</i> )

14:50.180 --> 14:52.600
What just... happened?

14:56.979 --> 14:57.980
Then he stormed off

14:58.063 --> 14:59.815
{\an1}without even
touching his corn!

14:59.898 --> 15:00.733
He's really mad.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.776
Oh, this is too good.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.362
Then why do I feel like
I'm going to ralph ravioli

15:05.446 --> 15:06.238
all over my shoes?

15:06.322 --> 15:09.158
That's to be expected
from a first-timer.

15:09.241 --> 15:09.658
Mm-hmm.

15:09.742 --> 15:10.659
It's guilt associated

15:10.743 --> 15:13.120
with betraying
your best friend.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.623
Wears off after
a couple hundred times.

15:15.706 --> 15:16.540
{\an1}Great.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.374
What's next?

15:17.458 --> 15:18.876
{\an1}Ginger calls Fred,
leaves him a message,

15:18.959 --> 15:22.338
{\an1}asks him to call her back,
more trouble ensues.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.673
But Ginger would never call...

15:24.757 --> 15:25.466
I got the number
to his dorm

15:25.549 --> 15:26.508
from my cousin Thea.

15:26.592 --> 15:29.053
Call now while
he's at class.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.305
MIRANDA:
It's programmed.

15:31.388 --> 15:32.765
Just hit "send."

15:32.848 --> 15:35.225
(<i> touch tones beeping</i> )

15:35.309 --> 15:39.021
Hi, Fred,
it's Ginger... Foutley.

15:39.104 --> 15:44.401
I've been missing you a lot,
so call me back, okay?

15:44.485 --> 15:46.695
MIRANDA:
That was great!

15:46.779 --> 15:48.697
{\an4}MIPSY:
You sounded
just like her!

15:48.781 --> 15:50.866
Oh, my gosh,
those little witches!

15:50.949 --> 15:52.785
They're totally undoing her.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.161
I've got to warn Ginger.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.498
NOELLE:
Monster movies--

15:57.581 --> 15:59.333
you should have
plenty of them.

15:59.416 --> 16:00.334
And he likes root beer!

16:00.417 --> 16:02.294
(<i> squawks</i> )

16:02.378 --> 16:04.463
There's no monster movies
or root beer

16:04.546 --> 16:05.464
in Parrot World, Noelle.

16:05.547 --> 16:09.134
Now, get out of my way!

16:09.218 --> 16:09.551
Where is Carl Foutley?!

16:09.635 --> 16:11.011
(<i> squawks</i> )

16:13.305 --> 16:14.682
Ginger...

16:14.765 --> 16:17.893
let me fix you a half-caf
mochaccino low-fat latté.

16:17.976 --> 16:20.688
You're going
to need it.

16:21.522 --> 16:22.231
Thanks, Courtney.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.191
So, what's up?

16:24.274 --> 16:25.317
Drive, Winston.

16:27.319 --> 16:31.073
Ginger, I'm afraid I'm your
only true friend in the world.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.074
Cinnamon?

16:32.157 --> 16:32.908
What?

16:32.991 --> 16:33.992
Your best friends,

16:34.076 --> 16:35.160
Dodie and Macie,

16:35.244 --> 16:36.245
are in cahoots
with Miranda and Mipsy.

16:36.328 --> 16:40.207
They're out to ruin
your relationship with Darren.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.917
You've got to be kidding.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.044
I wish I were,
but I'm not.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.003
More foam?

16:45.087 --> 16:47.047
Why would my best friends
want to ruin

16:47.131 --> 16:49.174
something that makes me
really happy?

16:49.258 --> 16:50.884
Why do they make
children's aspirin

16:50.968 --> 16:53.345
so difficult for
small children to open?

16:53.429 --> 16:55.180
Actually, Courtney,
they do that...

16:55.264 --> 16:57.766
My point is this:
there is no greater fury

16:57.850 --> 16:59.643
than that of
a B.F.F. scorned.

16:59.727 --> 17:00.644
Whether you
believe it or not,

17:00.728 --> 17:04.189
yours are conspiring
against you.

17:04.272 --> 17:05.482
Multi-colored sprinkles?

17:05.566 --> 17:08.109
I'm sorry, Courtney,
I just can't believe this.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.444
Don't take my word.

17:09.528 --> 17:10.654
Be by your
phone tonight,

17:10.738 --> 17:12.614
and we'll
three-way call Miranda,

17:12.698 --> 17:13.574
and I'll get her
to confess.

17:13.656 --> 17:16.452
{\an1}I hope you're wrong,
Courtney.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.618
{\an3}I'm not.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.829
Did you want that latté
in a to-go cup?

17:19.913 --> 17:21.457
You're a blue-front amazon.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.751
I'm a scarlet macaw.

17:23.834 --> 17:24.501
O-kay.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.670
No, I'm an African grey.

17:26.753 --> 17:28.297
You're a
blue-and-gold macaw.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.465
Whatever.

17:29.548 --> 17:30.632
POLLY:
I'm a blue-front,

17:30.716 --> 17:31.884
and you're a cockatoo,

17:31.967 --> 17:35.471
and we're fighting for
the same nesting branch!

17:35.554 --> 17:36.805
{\an5}CARL:
Fine by me,
Polly.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.057
Behold...

17:38.140 --> 17:39.683
Parrot World!

17:39.767 --> 17:40.684
(<i> squawks</i> )

17:40.768 --> 17:43.353
Uh, hate to burst
your bubble,

17:43.437 --> 17:45.063
{\an1}but it just looks like
a crummy backyard to me.

17:45.147 --> 17:51.236
{\an1}Carl Foutley, Parrot World
is not here, it's here.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.780
Now look again!

17:57.826 --> 18:00.162
{\an1}CARL:
Hmm... nope.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.079
Don't see it.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.206
(<i> squawks</i> )

18:02.289 --> 18:03.624
Look again!

18:11.089 --> 18:13.133
(<i> Carl gasps</i> )

18:15.344 --> 18:17.679
I see it!

18:17.763 --> 18:18.764
(<i> squawks</i> )

18:18.847 --> 18:21.225
(<i> both squawking</i> )

18:21.308 --> 18:23.310
(<i> laughing sinisterly</i> )

18:23.393 --> 18:26.647
Oh, this shall be
your undoing, Foutley.

18:26.730 --> 18:29.775
You mark my words.

18:29.858 --> 18:33.278
(<i> camera flashes</i> )

18:33.362 --> 18:35.614
Look, Ginger, I'm sorry
if I overreacted...

18:35.697 --> 18:37.366
(<i> phone rings,</i>
<i>answering machine clicks</i> )

18:37.449 --> 18:40.869
{\an5}GINGER (<i> on tape</i> ):
Hi, it's Ginger, leave me
a message.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.039
FRED (<i> on phone</i> ):
Ginger, it's Fred.

18:44.122 --> 18:46.166
Man, it was good
to hear your voice.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.042
I really miss you, too.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.628
I wasn't sure how you felt
when you left,

18:49.711 --> 18:52.089
but after your message...

18:52.172 --> 18:53.549
Darren, what are you...

18:53.632 --> 18:56.301
It's Fred,
returning your call.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.344
He misses you,
too.

18:57.427 --> 18:57.803
What?

18:57.886 --> 18:59.721
I didn't call Fred.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.640
FRED:
Can't wait to talk to you.

19:01.723 --> 19:04.309
Oh, my gosh...
then it's true.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.228
That sounds like
it should be my line.

19:06.311 --> 19:09.439
Courtney says Dodie and Macie
are trying to break us up.

19:09.523 --> 19:12.067
I think they're behind
this whole Fred thing.

19:12.150 --> 19:13.902
Are you serious?

19:13.986 --> 19:17.447
{\an1}Oh, Darren, I don't know
what to think.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.079
Hello, Carl.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.622
Uh, Noelle...

19:25.706 --> 19:27.040
What are you doing here?

19:27.124 --> 19:29.084
Did you have fun tonight?

19:29.167 --> 19:29.918
No.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.044
Promise?

19:31.128 --> 19:33.422
Of course, she's... nuts.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.591
But you like nuts,
don't you, Carl?

19:35.674 --> 19:38.135
Some nuts, not all.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.012
Macadamia nuts?

19:40.095 --> 19:40.220
They're all right.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.516
I got your glasses back
for you.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.642
(<i> gasps</i> )

19:45.726 --> 19:46.602
Carl!

19:46.685 --> 19:48.437
Then you do care!

19:48.520 --> 19:50.272
(<i> Noelle kissing</i> )

19:50.355 --> 19:52.399
Uh... I'm over here.

19:58.196 --> 20:00.616
{\an1}If you had fun
with Polly Schuster,

20:00.699 --> 20:01.450
{\an1}you could tell me,
you know.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.493
{\an3}I know.

20:03.577 --> 20:04.870
{\an1}Okay then.

20:04.953 --> 20:07.456
{\an1}Just two more days,
and it's over.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.207
Yep, can't wait.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.876
(<i> squawks</i> )

20:10.959 --> 20:14.129
(<i> phone rings</i> )

20:14.212 --> 20:15.797
Hello?

20:15.881 --> 20:17.007
It's show time,
Ginger.

20:17.090 --> 20:19.468
And please don't think
I take any form of joy

20:19.551 --> 20:22.387
{\an5}in presenting
this unfortunate
information to you.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.430
I truly don't.

20:23.513 --> 20:24.681
I know, Courtney.

20:24.765 --> 20:25.807
Thanks.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.142
Now, mute your phone,

20:27.225 --> 20:29.645
so Miranda doesn't
hear you breathing.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.230
(<i> touch tones beeping</i> )

20:31.313 --> 20:32.105
{\an1}Hello.

20:32.189 --> 20:32.981
Miranda, this
is Courtney.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.067
(<i> touch tones beeping</i> )

20:35.150 --> 20:37.444
Courtney...
what's up?

20:37.527 --> 20:39.071
Let me cut
to the chase.

20:39.154 --> 20:39.947
I know what you girls
are up to,

20:40.030 --> 20:43.533
I overheard you talking
in the bathroom,

20:43.617 --> 20:44.952
and I want in.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.663
Glad to hear you've come
to your senses, Courtney.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.998
So, what's the next
part of the plan?

20:50.082 --> 20:52.292
{\an1}Hold on, let me patch in
dumb and dumber,

20:52.376 --> 20:53.001
{\an1}so we can get you
up to speed.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.712
(<i> touch tones beeping</i> )

20:55.796 --> 20:56.838
{\an3}Hello.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.632
{\an1}Hi, Deirdre Hortense,
it's Miranda.

20:58.715 --> 21:00.592
{\an1}I got Courtney Gripling
on the line.

21:00.676 --> 21:01.927
{\an8}Greetings.

21:02.010 --> 21:04.471
{\an8}And she wants in on
operation G minus D.

21:04.554 --> 21:04.846
{\an3}Really?

21:04.930 --> 21:05.681
{\an8}That's correct.

21:05.764 --> 21:08.183
{\an8}So where are we
to date?

21:08.266 --> 21:11.019
{\an5}Okay, well, see,
I placed a call
to this guy Fred,

21:11.103 --> 21:12.312
pretending to be
Ginger.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.064
{\an8}Sounded just like her,
actually.

21:14.147 --> 21:16.525
{\an8}I never thought Dodie was
much of an actress,

21:16.608 --> 21:17.901
{\an8}so the surprise was mine.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.195
Anyhoo, I think he's
going to call her back,

21:20.278 --> 21:22.030
which should really
stir things up

21:22.114 --> 21:23.198
between her
and Darren.

21:23.281 --> 21:24.408
(<i> touch tones beeping</i> )

21:24.491 --> 21:26.827
Thanks, Courtney,
I've heard enough.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.580
<i>That</i> was Ginger?

21:30.664 --> 21:33.834
It was an ambush.

21:35.711 --> 21:36.712
Macie?

21:36.795 --> 21:37.713
That was Ginger.

21:37.796 --> 21:40.215
What have we done?

21:42.259 --> 21:43.719
Maybe we should
try and see it

21:43.802 --> 21:45.053
from their
point of view.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.305
Maybe they just felt
so crazy jealous.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.891
Darren, stop.

21:49.975 --> 21:53.395
{\an1}Would you ever do something
like this to a friend,

21:53.478 --> 21:55.480
no matter how hurt
or upset you were?

21:55.564 --> 21:56.898
No.

21:56.982 --> 22:00.277
I-I wouldn't.

22:05.282 --> 22:07.617
BLAKE:
How terribly romantic.

22:07.701 --> 22:12.622
Perhaps Noelle Sussman would be
interested in seeing this.

22:12.706 --> 22:16.376
I say I have my card,
Carl Foutley.

22:16.460 --> 22:21.131
Now I simply have to decide
when best to play it.

DODIE (<i> on phone</i> ):
Ginger, are you there?

22:31.433 --> 22:34.269
Ginger, please pick up.

22:34.352 --> 22:36.980
Look, I know you don't
want to talk to me right now,

22:37.064 --> 22:38.315
and I don't blame you,

22:38.398 --> 22:40.108
but I have so many things
that I want to say,

22:40.192 --> 22:44.488
starting with... I am <i> so</i> sorry.
