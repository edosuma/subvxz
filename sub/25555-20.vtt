things with me and you.

makes a comment, it kind

settle well with me.

{\an8}Sometimes, I don't
even give a (bleep)
about myself.

some (bleep) like that

11:09.502 --> 11:12.905

11:12.972 --> 11:15.674
{\an8}maybe I need to open up
and be there for her.

11:15.741 --> 11:17.643
{\an7}You don't think
I have the same (bleep)?

11:17.710 --> 11:22.882
{\an7}I was 22, thinking the
same (bleep), wanting
to be the same way,

11:22.948 --> 11:26.052
{\an8}doing the same thing
as you did. I'm 26.

11:26.118 --> 11:30.389
{\an7}That's why I'm trying to tell
you you'll overcome it and
you'll find your happiness.

11:30.456 --> 11:33.059
{\an8}Kortni, you're not the only one
that has those thoughts.

11:30.456 --> 11:33.059
{\an4}Exactly.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.694
{\an8}It's a long ride
and it's not always pretty,

11:35.761 --> 11:39.398
{\an8}but it's exactly
what you make it to be.

11:35.761 --> 11:39.398
{\an4}Exactly.

11:39.465 --> 11:42.768
{\an8}Okay? You're gonna
have hard times. All of us.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.804
{\an8}Trust me, I feel the same way
you do sometimes.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.239
{\an8}There's honestly
a reason why I'm here

11:47.306 --> 11:50.543
{\an8}because of how many
times I've tried to
(bleep) kill myself,

11:50.609 --> 11:53.546
{\an8}and I will not
admit that to anybody.

11:50.609 --> 11:53.546
{\an5}And listen...

11:53.612 --> 11:56.916
{\an8}And I will not admit
that to anybody but y'all
two mother(bleep)s

11:56.982 --> 11:58.484
{\an8}right here in this
(bleep) bathroom.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.386
{\an8}We don't want you to
ever go through that again.

12:00.453 --> 12:01.821
{\an7}This is something
we're talking about.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.022
{\an8}You can come stay
with us tonight.

12:03.089 --> 12:04.690
{\an8}You can sleep
in our bed, okay?

12:04.757 --> 12:06.926
{\an7}Hey, and I'm being dead ass
when I say that to you.

12:04.757 --> 12:06.926
{\an5}I love you.

12:06.992 --> 12:11.597
{\an8}By the way,
your zipper's down.

12:06.992 --> 12:11.597
{\an7}(laughs)

12:11.664 --> 12:14.700
{\an8}I can't expect people to know
my triggers if I have not

12:14.767 --> 12:17.336
{\an8}told them the backstory
and what not to say to me,

12:17.403 --> 12:20.039
{\an8}so that's my fault

12:20.106 --> 12:23.375
{\an8}and I should just
talk it out next time

12:23.442 --> 12:25.377
{\an8}instead of crying it out.

12:25.444 --> 12:28.714
{\an8}But it's nice to have my
roommates to have my back.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.483
{\an8}You want to go to bed?

12:31.951 --> 12:33.752
{\an8}She's not comfortable
being by herself

12:33.819 --> 12:35.521
{\an8}because
when she's by herself,

12:35.588 --> 12:37.756
{\an8}she goes to a dark place
in her head, and so I
don't want that at all.

12:37.823 --> 12:41.293
{\an8}If that means me, you know,
sleeping next to her and wiping
her tears away from her face,

12:41.360 --> 12:44.497
{\an8}then that's what I'm
gonna do just so she can
actually sleep tonight.

do that, you might as well

15:10.509 --> 15:13.178
{\an8}just piss on me
like a dog on a fire pole.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.581
{\an8}Yeah, she was only giving
you the stink eye 'cause
her guy didn't work out.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.549
{\an8}Oh, yeah. Just 'cause
she struck out...

15:17.616 --> 15:20.786

'cause she saw how pretty
the girl you were with, too,

15:20.853 --> 15:23.722

something that I've never done,

Nelson Mandela is?

19:10.682 --> 19:13.218
{\an7}Okay, Gus, we gonna teach you
about Nelson Mandela.

19:13.285 --> 19:16.154
{\an7}We're gonna have black
history lesson with Candace.

19:16.221 --> 19:19.324
{\an8}Poor Gus. He might not
have a whole lot going on

19:19.391 --> 19:23.228
{\an8}in that hair of his,
so we gotta educate him.

19:23.295 --> 19:26.999
{\an7}They put Nelson Mandela
in jail for 27 years
in South Africa, right?

19:27.065 --> 19:30.102
{\an8}He was in jail for 27 years
and he was consistently...

19:30.168 --> 19:31.436
{\an8}He's a Civil Rights
activist.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.071
{\an7}Yeah. And so, when he got out,
he ran for president.

19:33.138 --> 19:35.274
{\an7}They was like, (bleep)!
You've been in jail
for 27 years!

19:35.340 --> 19:38.143
{\an8}You a real (bleep)!
So, they let him...

19:35.340 --> 19:38.143
{\an5}They elected him president.

19:38.210 --> 19:39.545
{\an7}They elected him president,
and keep in mind,

19:39.611 --> 19:41.179
{\an7}I'm giving you the
drunk version, all right?

19:41.246 --> 19:44.316
{\an7}So, go look this (bleep) up

{\an8}Nelson Mandela.
Got it.

19:46.785 --> 19:48.887
{\an5}Nelson Mandela, yes.

19:48.954 --> 19:51.123
{\an7}And that is all for
black history with Candace.

19:51.189 --> 19:53.158

anybody else, I got you.

19:53.225 --> 19:54.393

20:05.637 --> 20:08.707
{\an8}it's like, do either of you
have respect for me?

20:08.774 --> 20:11.276
{\an9}Gus...

20:08.774 --> 20:11.276
{\an8}What's up, babe?

20:11.343 --> 20:15.781

{\an8}Like, especially
four racks worth.

22:07.726 --> 22:10.228
{\an8}If I get all the meat
off the bone first,

22:10.295 --> 22:12.798
{\an8}I can just pile it in,
and my fullness won't set in

22:12.864 --> 22:13.965

{\an8}Gus is sending me like these
crazy mixed signals.

26:46.638 --> 26:49.607
{\an8}Like, one minute he's telling me
that we need some space
from each other.

26:49.674 --> 26:52.110
{\an8}And then he's
affectionate towards me.

26:52.177 --> 26:54.479
{\an8}I'm like... well, what do you
want me to do?

26:54.546 --> 26:56.114
{\an8}He told me he doesn't want
anything with me,

26:56.181 --> 26:57.315
{\an8}he doesn't see anything with me,

26:57.382 --> 26:58.817
{\an8}so I'm trying
to respect his wishes.

27:34.052 --> 27:35.553
{\an8}Not always has Nilsa
been there for me,

27:35.620 --> 27:37.856
{\an8}but as of lately, she's starting
to show me that she still does

27:37.922 --> 27:41.426
{\an8}have feelings for me no matter,
you know, what she said
in the past.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.695
{\an8}You know, if somebody's willing
to stay around and, you know,

27:43.762 --> 27:46.131
{\an8}fight for me for that long,
maybe I should reconsider,

27:46.197 --> 27:48.033
{\an8}you know, actually
giving her a chance.

28:01.146 --> 28:05.183
{\an8}♪ I can't stop dreaming ♪

28:05.250 --> 28:07.552
{\an8}♪ About you ♪

28:07.619 --> 28:08.653
{\an8}♪ Every kiss... ♪

28:08.720 --> 28:14.659
{\an8}♪♪

28:19.230 --> 28:20.665
{\an8}Like, are you (bleep) serious?

28:24.569 --> 28:25.804
{\an8}This is my worst nightmare.

28:25.870 --> 28:28.039
{\an8}I'm literally living
my worst nightmare.

28:33.011 --> 28:35.914
{\an8}Candace is not going
to handle this well.

28:35.980 --> 28:37.415
{\an8}(bleep) is already stressful,

28:37.482 --> 28:40.952
{\an8}and y'all put glass
as the floor.

28:47.058 --> 28:49.394
{\an8}♪♪

28:51.796 --> 28:53.531
{\an8}Well, this sucks.

28:53.598 --> 28:56.868
{\an8}I felt like I was reeling guys
back on in,

28:56.935 --> 29:00.038
{\an8}and all of a sudden the big
shark just came and "rarh!"
And got it.

29:06.744 --> 29:08.346
{\an8}You know,
so I'm talking to Nilsa,

29:08.413 --> 29:10.048
{\an8}and we're having this
emotional talk,

29:10.115 --> 29:11.649
{\an8}and then I see Jules
walk through the door,

29:11.716 --> 29:12.984
{\an8}and it's like this talk never
happened because

29:13.051 --> 29:15.353
{\an8}I'm instantly like,
"Oh! There's Jules.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.855
{\an8}I'm putting all my eggs
in this basket again."

29:24.562 --> 29:26.464
{\an8}(Nilsa)
It's refreshing that Gus and I

29:26.531 --> 29:28.032
{\an8}could have came on
this Cabo trip

29:28.099 --> 29:31.536
{\an8}and made something out of
whatever we have going on.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.838
{\an8}I still feel like we have
a connection, like,

29:33.905 --> 29:36.274
{\an8}what if I would have let that
conversation go more?

29:36.341 --> 29:40.345
{\an8}And I could have went completely
the opposite of what happened.

29:53.558 --> 29:55.326
{\an8}(Kirk)
Gus, his street smarts
when it comes to girls,

29:55.393 --> 29:57.896
{\an8}they're not there.
He does not think.

30:01.099 --> 30:02.400
{\an8}First, he blew it with Nilsa,

30:02.467 --> 30:05.036
{\an8}and now Gus's girl sees that
he's hollering at

30:05.103 --> 30:06.504
{\an8}two other girls at the bar.

30:06.571 --> 30:08.840
{\an8}She's like, "All right, cool,
whatever, I'll leave."

30:08.907 --> 30:10.175
{\an8}Bro, you're just talking to
girls. Like, she's pissed.

30:10.241 --> 30:12.110
{\an8}Like, you (bleep) up.

30:18.082 --> 30:20.485
{\an8}Hey... let's go.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.120
{\an8}(Candace)
We gotta cut the club
time short.

30:22.187 --> 30:24.055
{\an8}Tomorrow's our last day in Cabo.

30:24.122 --> 30:26.057
{\an8}We all gotta go home,
get some sleep,

30:26.124 --> 30:27.959
{\an8}and not be trashed
in the morning.

30:41.839 --> 30:43.408
{\an8}(Gus)
You know, honestly, I just get

30:43.474 --> 30:44.809
{\an8}caught up in flirting

30:44.876 --> 30:46.444
{\an8}and, you know, just having fun
playing the field

30:46.511 --> 30:48.646
{\an8}that I don't really necessarily

30:48.713 --> 30:50.582
{\an8}notice what's exactly in front
of me.

30:50.648 --> 30:52.584
{\an8}And so I'm bummed out that
the night just can't go

30:52.650 --> 30:54.752
{\an8}exactly how I want it because
I'm going home by myself.

30:54.819 --> 30:57.222
{\an8}I'm going in the back.
I'm (bleep) pissed off.

31:00.291 --> 31:02.193
{\an8}♪♪

31:04.562 --> 31:07.832
{\an8}Oh, nip slip, nip slip.
Oh, God.

31:09.601 --> 31:10.935
{\an8}Look at this
drunk bitch.

31:11.002 --> 31:12.003
{\an8}I'm stubborn.

31:12.070 --> 31:12.937
{\an8}(Candace)
Let's go to sleep.

31:13.004 --> 31:15.473
{\an8}Let's go to sleep, Nilsa.

31:20.211 --> 31:23.414
{\an7}So what's going on?
What's going through your mind?

31:23.481 --> 31:26.851
{\an8}I (bleep) like that girl
and I can't even spend
any time with her.

31:26.918 --> 31:30.288
{\an8}He's a little angry,
so I decide to just, you know,

31:30.355 --> 31:32.890
{\an8}talk to Gus and let him know
that I'm here for him

31:32.957 --> 31:34.025
{\an8}if he needs anything.

31:36.194 --> 31:37.929
{\an8}(Nilsa)
Gus didn't come back
with that girl,

31:37.996 --> 31:39.464
{\an8}so I'm thinking like...

31:39.530 --> 31:42.400
{\an8}this is the perfect opportunity
to see where this could go.

31:42.467 --> 31:44.302
{\an8}Where's Gus?

31:44.369 --> 31:46.304
{\an8}I just love you, you know,
if you never find a girl,

31:46.371 --> 31:48.306
{\an7}I'll be here to marry ya,
BFF.

31:48.373 --> 31:50.975
{\an8}I'll be there to marry
you, too, girl, trust me.

31:51.042 --> 31:53.444
{\an7}(bleep), I'll your kids.
I'm trying to have triplets.

31:53.511 --> 31:55.113
{\an9}(laughing)

31:55.179 --> 31:56.648
{\an8}(Nilsa)
What the hell's going on?

31:56.714 --> 31:58.483
{\an8}You know, anytime Gus
goes missing,

31:58.549 --> 32:00.485
{\an8}I just need to automatically
assume he's with Kortni.

32:00.551 --> 32:02.820
{\an8}She's broken girl code
so many times.

32:02.887 --> 32:05.923
{\an8}Just like do either of you
have respect for me?

32:05.990 --> 32:09.827
{\an8}Like, Gus, we've had a thing.
Kortni, you're my friend.

32:09.894 --> 32:12.730
{\an8}In what world did you guys
think that wouldn't bother me?

32:12.797 --> 32:14.065
{\an8}Gus...

32:14.132 --> 32:15.233
{\an8}What's up, babe?

32:17.669 --> 32:21.005
{\an8}(Kortni)
I have an APB out
on a thirsty-ass bitch,

32:21.072 --> 32:24.142
{\an8}and she's out on the patio,
and her name is Nilsa.

32:24.208 --> 32:25.743
{\an7}I'm gonna be there
in just a sec.

32:31.382 --> 32:33.651
{\an8}No. Gilsa police right here.

32:33.718 --> 32:34.952
{\an8}(bleep).

32:35.019 --> 32:35.953
{\an8}Bitch.

32:37.488 --> 32:39.590
{\an8}Don't sleep with her.

32:39.657 --> 32:41.125
{\an8}She's in my bed right now.

32:41.192 --> 32:42.960
{\an8}(Kortni)
Yeah, um...

32:43.027 --> 32:44.629
{\an8}And you can sleep in mine.

32:46.264 --> 32:49.400
{\an8}(Gus)
Me and Kortni don't really have
an emotional history

32:49.467 --> 32:51.502
{\an8}or a physical relationship
history,

32:51.569 --> 32:54.005
{\an8}and so there's nothing wrong
with me sleeping in the bed
with Kortni at this point

32:54.072 --> 32:57.208
{\an8}because I'm not leading her on
by letting her sleep next to me

32:57.275 --> 32:58.676
{\an8}and us, you know,
snuggling or whatever,

32:58.743 --> 33:00.945
{\an8}because it's not that type
of relationship.

33:07.251 --> 33:08.553
{\an7}(kiss)

33:08.619 --> 33:11.022
{\an9}Love you.

33:08.619 --> 33:11.022
{\an8}Love you, too, girl.

33:17.228 --> 33:20.365
{\an8}♪♪

33:27.338 --> 33:30.375
{\an8}Time to wake up.

33:30.441 --> 33:34.345
{\an8}This morning, I go
to wake my girl Candace up.

33:34.412 --> 33:38.349
{\an8}Guess who I find next to her.
Kortni.

33:38.416 --> 33:42.320
{\an8}Guess who I find snuggling her.

33:42.387 --> 33:43.688
{\an8}Gus.

33:48.126 --> 33:49.694
{\an8}Oh, (bleep).

33:49.761 --> 33:53.898
{\an8}Once again, let's play the game
where Nilsa gets strung along,

33:53.965 --> 33:56.567
{\an8}and then he goes and sleeps
in the bed with Kortni.

33:57.735 --> 33:59.203
{\an8}I'm (bleep) done with guys.

33:59.270 --> 34:02.907
{\an8}Like, you can play
these child games with Kortni

34:02.974 --> 34:05.676
{\an8}or some other bitch at the bar,
but not me.

34:05.743 --> 34:08.045
{\an8}You see how good
these eyebrows look?

34:08.112 --> 34:10.748
{\an8}These eyebrows don't deserve
to get (bleep) with.

34:12.315 --> 34:14.351
{\an8}(indistinct chatter)

34:28.666 --> 34:31.034
{\an8}We slept in a frickin' bed.

34:31.101 --> 34:35.572
{\an8}It's not like we're having sex,
making out, blah, blah, blah.

34:35.639 --> 34:40.378
{\an8}If Nilsa's feelings are hurt,
that sucks.

34:40.445 --> 34:45.116
{\an8}But it's really just up to her
if she wants to be mad about it.

34:45.183 --> 34:48.485
{\an8}It's just a (bleep) bed.

34:49.786 --> 34:52.223
{\an8}♪♪

34:52.290 --> 34:54.792
{\an8}I still got my eye makeup on
from last night, ugh.

34:54.859 --> 34:57.295
{\an7}(Jeremiah)
Coffee. No shots, Gus.

34:57.361 --> 34:59.230
{\an8}I wanna create some
Mexican momentum.

34:59.297 --> 35:00.698
{\an8}I don't wanna go back
to the hotel room.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.767
{\an8}I wanna do something now that
we're all up and out.

35:02.834 --> 35:03.901
{\an8}Dune buggy
racing.

35:03.968 --> 35:05.870
{\an8}Horseback riding up
a mountain.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.004
{\an7}(Jeremiah)
Horseback riding?

35:07.071 --> 35:08.072
{\an7}Didn't your uncle
die like that?

35:08.139 --> 35:09.307
{\an8}He was on a donkey.

35:09.373 --> 35:10.541
{\an8}(Jeremiah)
Uh, no.

35:10.608 --> 35:12.076
{\an8}Long as we're not
doing crystal meth,

35:12.143 --> 35:16.214
{\an8}um, matching tattoos, I'm--
I'll probably go with the flow.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.282
{\an7}(Jeremiah)
We just woke up this morning,

35:18.349 --> 35:20.251
{\an7}and we're trying to do
something thrilling,

35:20.318 --> 35:22.753
{\an7}exciting, that defines
Cabo, Mexico.

35:22.820 --> 35:25.356
{\an8}I have the greatest
(indistinct).

35:25.423 --> 35:26.691
{\an8}It's in the middle
of the desert.

35:26.757 --> 35:28.259
{\an8}It's like big hiney on.

35:28.326 --> 35:32.230
{\an8}It's a giant swing, so I know
you will love it, enjoy it.

35:32.296 --> 35:34.332
{\an8}(Kortni)
So we're gonna do a giant swing.

35:34.398 --> 35:36.334
{\an7}Does he mean like
giant swing?

35:36.400 --> 35:37.468
{\an8}(Jeremiah)
Maybe.

35:37.535 --> 35:38.402
{\an7}'Cause I don't really--
I didn't really

35:38.469 --> 35:39.804
{\an8}understand what he said.

35:39.871 --> 35:42.106
{\an8}I can't really make out
what this guy's saying,

35:42.173 --> 35:43.474
{\an8}but it sounded like "jushwing."

35:43.541 --> 35:45.042
{\an8}And I don't know
what a jushwing is,

35:45.109 --> 35:49.113
{\an8}but, you know, I don't wanna
get on a jushwing.

35:49.180 --> 35:50.214
{\an7}(Jeremiah)
Oh, yeah.

35:50.281 --> 35:51.415
{\an9}Thank you.

35:51.482 --> 35:52.750
{\an8}(overlappng thank yous)

35:52.817 --> 35:54.385
{\an8}♪♪

35:54.452 --> 35:56.621
{\an8}(Kirk)
Yeah, whatever we do today,

35:56.687 --> 35:58.623
{\an8}odds are, you know, Candace
is gonna hate it.

35:58.689 --> 36:01.292
{\an8}She's scared of heights.
She's scared of... water.

36:01.359 --> 36:02.593
{\an8}She's scared of walking.

36:02.660 --> 36:04.428
{\an8}She's scared of anything
non-alcoholic.

36:04.495 --> 36:06.731
{\an8}(laughing)
You know, it's just anything...

36:06.797 --> 36:08.432
{\an8}and everything,
Candace is scared of.

36:08.499 --> 36:10.434
{\an8}So you think you got
to do a height?

36:10.501 --> 36:11.969
{\an7}Uh, yeah.

36:10.501 --> 36:11.969
{\an9}Oh, yeah.

36:12.036 --> 36:14.305
{\an8}Look at Candace.
Look at Candace.

36:14.372 --> 36:15.306
{\an8}(all giggling)

36:15.373 --> 36:17.542
{\an8}We'll scare
your ass.

36:17.608 --> 36:21.579
{\an8}Yo, what if they
make us sign waivers?
You know what that means.

36:21.646 --> 36:23.814
{\an8}(Aimee)
That means there's the
possibility you could die.

36:23.881 --> 36:26.517
{\an8}You will die.

36:23.881 --> 36:26.517
{\an8}Let's do it!

36:26.584 --> 36:27.518
{\an9}(laughing)

36:27.585 --> 36:28.519
{\an8}(Aimee)
Let's go.

36:28.586 --> 36:29.520
{\an8}We gonna die.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.462
{\an8}Whores for days!

36:38.529 --> 36:40.765
{\an8}(Nilsa)
I just wanna lay down somewhere.

36:40.831 --> 36:43.167
{\an8}(Jeremiah)
<i>Vamanos,</i> children.
<i>Vamanos, niños.</i>

36:43.234 --> 36:46.070
{\an8}(Nilsa)
This is one of the worst
hangovers I've never had.

36:46.137 --> 36:47.204
{\an8}(Codi)
I feel great.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.255
{\an8}(Nilsa)
Me and Mexico just
aren't getting along.

37:04.322 --> 37:08.993
{\an8}The road to Wild Canyon
is curvy. It's bumpy.

37:09.060 --> 37:12.296
{\an8}Mentally and emotionally, it's
like literally too much for me.

37:12.363 --> 37:14.532
{\an8}Dude, I'm so excited,
just driving through here.

37:14.599 --> 37:15.800
{\an8}Just about what
we're about to do.

37:18.169 --> 37:21.205
{\an8}(Nilsa)
I'm just not cut out
for the Mexican life.

37:21.272 --> 37:23.674
{\an9}(coughs)

37:23.741 --> 37:24.909
{\an8}(burps)

37:24.976 --> 37:26.377
{\an8}Ugh.

37:26.444 --> 37:28.346
{\an8}I'm sick, I'm (bleep) sick
as a dog.

37:28.412 --> 37:29.747
{\an8}♪♪

37:29.814 --> 37:31.315
{\an8}Gonna make it?

37:31.382 --> 37:32.683
{\an8}I'm sorry, y'all.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.186
{\an8}No, don't be sorry.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.186
{\an8}Nothing to be
sorry about.

37:35.252 --> 37:36.721

What am I signing?

37:48.366 --> 37:49.400
{\an8}Uh, your life away.

37:53.070 --> 37:54.005
{\an8}No way.

37:54.071 --> 37:56.173
{\an8}We're doing what?

37:56.240 --> 37:58.175
{\an8}(Jeremiah)
300 feet, you said?

37:58.242 --> 38:00.578
{\an8}I-- I'm so nervous,
I forgot my address.

38:00.645 --> 38:03.781
{\an8}I know I agreed to face my fears
and try new things,

38:03.848 --> 38:07.051

absolutely not doing it.

38:07.118 --> 38:10.655
{\an8}I just... I like Mexico,
I don't wanna die today, so...

38:13.491 --> 38:15.292
{\an8}I'm so scared of heights.

38:15.359 --> 38:17.428

38:27.438 --> 38:30.474
{\an7}Guys, if you turn around,
that's the gondola.

38:30.541 --> 38:32.343
{\an8}That's where you guys
are doing the swing.

38:32.410 --> 38:33.644
{\an8}(Candace)

38:43.954 --> 38:47.491
{\an8}♪♪

38:49.160 --> 38:52.830
{\an8}(Aimee)
This swing looks like it's
on a top of the mountain,

38:52.897 --> 38:55.332
{\an8}and you just drop
to your death.

38:55.399 --> 38:58.703
{\an8}Candace is not going
to handle this well.

38:58.769 --> 39:00.871
{\an8}Next, this one.

39:00.938 --> 39:02.707
{\an7}And...

39:02.773 --> 39:03.908
{\an8}(indistinct chatter)

39:03.974 --> 39:05.009
{\an8}(Candace)
How do I put it on?

39:05.076 --> 39:07.545
{\an8}(Kirk and Kortni laughing)

39:07.611 --> 39:09.480
{\an8}(Codi)

39:09.547 --> 39:12.817
{\an8}(all chanting)

39:12.883 --> 39:14.351

39:14.418 --> 39:17.555
{\an8}(all chanting)
Ai-mee! Ai-mee! Ai-mee! Ai-mee!

39:17.621 --> 39:20.524
{\an8}♪♪

39:20.591 --> 39:22.460
{\an8}(buzzard screeches)

39:27.398 --> 39:28.799
{\an8}(bleep) is already stressful,

39:28.866 --> 39:33.104
{\an7}and y'all put glass
as the floor.

39:34.472 --> 39:35.773
{\an8}Can I have these
tightened up a little bit?

39:35.840 --> 39:37.141
{\an8}'Cause I'm so scared
I'm gonna fall out of it.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.275
{\an8}You're not gonna
fall out of it.

39:38.342 --> 39:39.710
{\an8}You promise? Okay.

39:38.342 --> 39:39.710
{\an9}I promise.

39:39.777 --> 39:41.912
{\an8}I don't feel like this harness
will hold my fat ass up.

39:41.979 --> 39:44.115
{\an8}Tighten it, bitch.

39:44.181 --> 39:46.851
{\an8}(clanking)

39:46.917 --> 39:48.619
{\an8}(Candace)
This contraption here

39:48.686 --> 39:51.055
{\an8}is making all kinds of sounds.

39:51.122 --> 39:53.591
{\an9}(clanking)

39:55.593 --> 39:57.762
{\an8}Sir, I-- I don't-- I don't
like these sound effects.

39:57.828 --> 39:59.830
{\an8}Like, I don't know when
they built this thing,

39:59.897 --> 40:02.133
{\an8}but it don't sound like
it's really sturdy.

40:02.199 --> 40:03.567
{\an8}And I know I'ma die.

40:03.634 --> 40:04.802
{\an8}(Aimee)
Like five extra times,

40:04.869 --> 40:07.505
{\an8}make sure I am hooked
all the way in.

40:07.571 --> 40:09.573
{\an7}(Candace)
Yeah, I'm...
terrified to walk.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.041
{\an8}Step down with us.

40:11.108 --> 40:12.276
{\an8}Okay, what do I hold onto?

40:12.343 --> 40:13.511
{\an8}Here.

40:13.577 --> 40:14.645
{\an8}Sir, I'm so scared.

40:14.712 --> 40:16.680
{\an8}It's going to be fine.
Step down.

40:16.747 --> 40:18.282
{\an8}Yeah, my breathing
is getting really bad.

40:18.349 --> 40:19.683
{\an8}Your hands are--

40:18.349 --> 40:19.683
{\an8}Ohh!

40:19.750 --> 40:20.718
{\an8}What? What is that?
What is that?

40:20.785 --> 40:22.853
{\an7}It's because
she see first.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.455
{\an7}It's okay, it's okay.
Put your hand here.

40:24.522 --> 40:26.690
{\an8}(Aimee)
I was worried about Candace,

40:26.757 --> 40:29.627
{\an8}but, (bleep), I'm a little
worried about myself right now.

40:29.693 --> 40:31.695
{\an8}(Aimee whimpering)

40:31.762 --> 40:34.098
{\an8}Ohh... God.

40:34.165 --> 40:35.900
{\an8}(whimpering)

40:35.966 --> 40:38.435
{\an8}(Aimee)
I'm just dangling there
in the air,

40:38.502 --> 40:41.138
{\an8}and I look down...
this is way too far.

40:41.205 --> 40:42.673
{\an8}This is dangerous.
Normal people don't do

40:42.740 --> 40:44.909
{\an8}this (bleep), and I'm normal.

40:44.975 --> 40:47.411
{\an8}(Candace)
Sir, is this safe?
Wait, sir, wait.

40:47.478 --> 40:50.181
{\an8}Is it-- Wait,
I'm stuck to the thing.

40:50.247 --> 40:51.749
{\an8}(Candace)
I'm scared!

40:50.247 --> 40:51.749
{\an5}I'm so scared.

{\an8}like, making me feel better?"

40:56.554 --> 40:59.023
{\an8}Aimee ain't helping it.
Aimee's scared, too.

40:59.089 --> 41:00.524
{\an8}So, hell, we just gonna
be scared together.

41:00.591 --> 41:03.494
{\an8}I'm terrified, I'm shaking,
I'm nervous, I'm crying.

41:03.561 --> 41:04.762
{\an8}I don't wanna do it.

41:04.829 --> 41:07.097
{\an8}Come on, Candace,
Aimee, you got it!

41:07.164 --> 41:11.802
{\an8}(Aimee whimpering)
