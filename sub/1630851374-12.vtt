00:01.835 --> 00:03.795
SUSANNAH:
Jenny and I did
get into a fight...

00:03.837 --> 00:06.548
Mm-hmm.
...the day she went missing.

00:06.589 --> 00:09.300
That's why I broke
off this bracelet.

00:11.052 --> 00:12.929
Hang on, why didn't you
tell me any of this before?

00:12.971 --> 00:16.224
I'm getting there.
Jenny was, um...

00:17.183 --> 00:19.060
She was at swim practice,
and she walked over

00:19.102 --> 00:21.271
to my house all upset

00:21.312 --> 00:23.106
because her brother
forgot to pick her up.

00:24.065 --> 00:25.817
(sighs)

00:25.859 --> 00:27.569
Look, Jenny...

00:29.487 --> 00:32.032
...she needed
a lot of attention.

00:32.073 --> 00:35.994
An she was always saying
these ridiculous things like,

00:36.036 --> 00:38.455
"If I killed myself, no
one would even notice."

00:38.496 --> 00:40.832
Did she threaten that that day?

00:40.874 --> 00:44.461
Every day, it was that or
"run away with her boyfriend."

00:44.502 --> 00:46.171
What? She had a boyfriend?

00:46.212 --> 00:47.922
He wasn't real.

00:47.964 --> 00:51.009
He was this older guy
that she made up for attention.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.219
She was a
pathological liar.

00:53.261 --> 00:56.431
Anyway, when she said
she was gonna run away with him

00:56.473 --> 00:59.267
for the millionth time,
I just...

00:59.309 --> 01:02.187
I snapped and said,

01:02.228 --> 01:04.689
"Well, maybe you should
just go kill yourself."

01:06.733 --> 01:09.819
I obviously didn't think
she actually would.

01:09.861 --> 01:13.823
Susannah, what if the boyfriend
wasn't fake?

01:13.865 --> 01:15.867
(sniffles)

01:15.909 --> 01:17.869
If she actually ran away
with him that day,

01:17.911 --> 01:19.662
maybe he had something to do
with her disappearance.

01:19.704 --> 01:22.665
Not suicide.
Believe me,
he was fake.

01:22.707 --> 01:26.336
She said he wanted to
keep their relationship

01:26.377 --> 01:28.296
"between them"
because he was older.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.090
Then, to convince
me, she made up

01:30.131 --> 01:32.342
all these little details
about him, it was...

01:34.260 --> 01:35.637
It was insane.
What details?

01:35.678 --> 01:37.555
Like, what?
God, like,

01:37.597 --> 01:40.350
how he made the best
eggplant Parmesan.

01:40.391 --> 01:44.020
Oh, he broke his collar
bone on a waterslide once,

01:44.062 --> 01:46.231
or, um, uh...

01:46.272 --> 01:48.316
He taught her how to
solve a Rubik's Cube.

01:48.358 --> 01:51.236
And she solved it for
me just to prove it...

01:51.277 --> 01:53.530
(clicking, shuffling)
But she probably just

01:53.571 --> 01:55.240
taught herself on YouTube
or something.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.574
That's something
that she would do.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.493
MURPHY:
Thanks for your help in there.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.161
What was the noise
you were making?

02:00.203 --> 02:01.913
FELIX: Noise?
Yes, right in the middle of...

02:01.955 --> 02:03.456
when he was talking,
it was like...

02:03.498 --> 02:05.333
(imitates shuffling sound)
FELIX: Oh.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.252
FELIX:
I was solving a Rubik's Cube.

02:09.254 --> 02:12.632
I don't-- I don't think
he was fake.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.635
I think that older boyfriend
was her uncle.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.055
♪ ♪

02:27.105 --> 02:29.274
Hey, depresso, eat a pancake.

02:29.315 --> 02:33.695
I-- For the last time,
I don't want a pancake.

02:33.736 --> 02:35.864
God, you're so annoying.
Why aren't you at work?

02:35.905 --> 02:38.449
Because it's Christmas Eve.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.826
Right.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.536
Are you that out of it?

02:41.578 --> 02:42.912
I left Murphy

02:42.954 --> 02:45.957
under a highway, okay?

02:45.999 --> 02:49.502
I left my blind friend
under a highway

02:49.544 --> 02:51.504
because I got my
stupid feelings hurt.

02:51.546 --> 02:54.048
And then I made everything worse
by calling Sam.

02:54.090 --> 02:56.426
So now, if she goes to jail,

02:56.467 --> 02:58.052
Sam will kill her there.

02:58.094 --> 03:01.556
And who knows if I'll
ever see her again?

03:01.598 --> 03:02.891
Good morning.
Good morning.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.267
Uh, have a pancake.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.352
I made them out of a box.
Don't judge me.

03:06.394 --> 03:07.979
Oh, come on,
who has the time

03:08.021 --> 03:10.023
to mix together flour and sugar?
(phone buzzes)

03:10.064 --> 03:12.066
Ah.
Mmm. (chuckles)

03:12.108 --> 03:14.235
Thank you.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.070
Aww.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.572
What?
Nothing.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.449
What?
It was my friend saying

03:19.490 --> 03:21.492
she'll miss my annual
Christmas Eve party.

03:23.369 --> 03:26.039
You have an annual
Christmas Eve party?

03:26.080 --> 03:28.249
I've never been invited.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.709
Okay, why aren't you
doing it this year?

03:29.751 --> 03:32.212
Uh, because of you felons.
I cancelled it.

03:32.253 --> 03:34.839
Seriously?
Yeah. It's fine.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.592
No, come on.
Let's have it.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.636
What, and you guys hide
in the closet the whole time?

03:39.677 --> 03:41.554
MAX: No, I don't mean,
like, a party.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.431
I mean, we can celebrate,
you know.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.141
Just the, uh--
Just the three of us.

03:45.183 --> 03:47.435
Huh?
Really?

03:47.477 --> 03:51.272
I'm sorry, you actually want
to frolic around a ham

03:51.314 --> 03:54.734
singing "Jingle Bells" while
Murphy is still AWOL?

03:54.776 --> 03:56.569
I just want to have dinner.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.071
I mean, come on, Felix,
don't you want to

03:58.112 --> 03:59.572
do something a little normal?

03:59.614 --> 04:02.575
No. because our lives
aren't normal. Okay?

04:02.617 --> 04:05.161
And you can't just hit pause
because you feel like it.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.788
In case you
haven't noticed,

04:06.829 --> 04:09.624
we still have no idea
where the hell Murphy is.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.676
You're back.

04:19.717 --> 04:22.470
We have to talk about Jenny.

04:28.893 --> 04:30.812
Can I get you something?
Tea, water?

04:30.853 --> 04:33.523
Uh, tea. Yeah.
Tea-tea sounds great.

04:33.564 --> 04:35.191
Sure thing.
Thanks.

04:41.155 --> 04:44.200
(sighs)
Really? This dude?

04:44.242 --> 04:45.827
Yes, this dude.

04:45.868 --> 04:47.704
He was having an affair
with his niece.

04:47.745 --> 04:49.747
Ew.
Yeah.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.541
Exactly.

04:51.582 --> 04:53.376
(sighs)

04:54.877 --> 04:57.046
So you think I'm, like...

04:57.088 --> 04:59.257
literally in the house
right now?

04:59.299 --> 05:01.509
I think it's possible.

05:01.551 --> 05:02.927
Why would he be
keeping me here?

05:02.969 --> 05:04.554
Because he killed Jenny.

05:04.595 --> 05:06.389
Oh...

05:06.431 --> 05:08.641
When she tried to expose them.
Right.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.518
And then suddenly,
ten years later,

05:10.560 --> 05:12.145
someone shows up with her name,
her social security number.

05:12.186 --> 05:14.272
Everything. So he's probably
keeping you here

05:14.314 --> 05:15.690
while he tries to
figure out how you got

05:15.732 --> 05:17.233
all of her information.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.527
Or, like I thought,
he tried to kill Jenny,

05:19.569 --> 05:21.904
but she ran away, and now
he thinks you're her.

05:21.946 --> 05:24.240
He thinks you're Jenny.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.868
Yeah, that makes a lot
of sense, Murph.

05:29.579 --> 05:30.788
How do you plan on finding me

05:30.830 --> 05:33.708
with this guy hanging around?

05:33.750 --> 05:35.877
Get him on a date
and steal his keys.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.047
(exhales sharply)

05:40.715 --> 05:44.844
No offense, but I think you're
a little too old for him.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.305
And you're wearing
a crew neck.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.557
And you haven't showered
in days.
Shut up.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.976
So...
(sniffs, clears throat)

05:52.018 --> 05:54.604
Here you go.
Oh, thank you.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.481
I'm putting it

05:56.522 --> 05:59.067
right in front of you.
Oh...

05:59.108 --> 06:00.985
Oh, thank you.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.909
It smells so good in here.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.577
Thank you.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.746
Making dinner for
Christmas Eve.
Mmm.

06:11.788 --> 06:12.914
Are you having people over?

06:12.955 --> 06:15.124
No. Uh...

06:15.166 --> 06:18.336
just using it as
an excuse to cook.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.587
So what can I do for you?

06:19.629 --> 06:22.507
Uh, I, um...

06:22.548 --> 06:26.761
I just wanted to apologize.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.262
For what?

06:28.304 --> 06:29.889
Well, um...

06:29.931 --> 06:33.726
I was... just...

06:33.768 --> 06:37.146
To be honest, um, the reason
I was looking for Jenny,

06:37.188 --> 06:40.108
um, is because I thought
that her case would

06:40.149 --> 06:42.360
lead me to my friend Jess.

06:42.402 --> 06:46.072
And I just kind of became
obsessed with the whole thing,

06:46.114 --> 06:48.616
and I-I didn't even think about
how hard it might have been

06:48.658 --> 06:53.162
for you to have to dredge up
all those memories, and...

06:53.204 --> 06:56.916
I just feel like an ass,
and I'm sorry.

06:56.958 --> 07:01.170
That's very kind of you.
But unnecessary.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.339
I know what it's like to want
to find somebody

07:03.381 --> 07:05.258
as badly as you do.

07:05.299 --> 07:06.592
(loud thud)

07:08.219 --> 07:10.471
Sorry.
My dog, uh,

07:10.513 --> 07:13.599
thinks she's an acrobat,
apparently.

07:13.641 --> 07:15.643
I'm actually gonna go
put her outside.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.395
Will you excuse me a moment?
Sure.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.605
All right. Be right back.
Yeah.

07:21.899 --> 07:24.318
Wow.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.404
Maybe you're not wrong
about this after all.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.239
I told you I would find you.

07:28.281 --> 07:31.409
I told you.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.494
No one believed me.

07:37.039 --> 07:39.459
Hey, guys,
it's Christmas Eve.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.918
You can go home
if you want.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.044
I'm good.
I don't have any plans.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.130
Same.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.590
Look, Murphy has to eat,

07:45.631 --> 07:47.008
she has to sleep;
w-where is she doing that?

07:47.049 --> 07:49.135
Car. Motel.

07:49.177 --> 07:52.138
Still, she needs help.
Who's helping her?

07:52.180 --> 07:53.931
Wait, what about Darnell?

07:53.973 --> 07:56.309
What?

07:56.350 --> 07:57.894
Darnell visited Jess
in the hospital, right?

07:57.935 --> 07:59.228
He's probably helping them.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.646
Oh, my God, how did we

08:00.688 --> 08:02.523
not think of this before?
No,

08:02.565 --> 08:05.776
he said he didn't
know anything.
He could be lying.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.153
Sarah, he just met you
for lunch, right?

08:07.195 --> 08:08.905
Could you give him a call?
Sure.

08:08.946 --> 08:10.615
You...

08:10.656 --> 08:12.658
let's do it.
Let's do it.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.579
Sorry about that.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.165
Oh, no problem.
Don't worry about it.

08:19.207 --> 08:22.126
Look, I appreciate
the apology,

08:22.168 --> 08:24.045
but again, no need.

08:24.086 --> 08:25.755
I still feel bad.

08:25.796 --> 08:29.675
I... I'd love to, um,
make it right

08:29.717 --> 08:30.927
and take you out
for a drink.

08:30.968 --> 08:32.011
Is there a bar
around here

08:32.053 --> 08:33.304
that you like
or something?

08:33.346 --> 08:35.890
Oh, no, thank you.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.226
Come on, you don't want to
be alone on Christmas Eve.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.853
It's not as bad as you think.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.146
Now, if you'll excuse me,

08:42.188 --> 08:44.565
I really have to get
back to the kitchen.

08:44.607 --> 08:47.693
Yeah. Sure, I understand.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.570
Um...

08:51.155 --> 08:55.034
I'll just order a car,
and I'll be out of your hair.

09:00.122 --> 09:03.084
Is my phone on the table
or around here or something?

09:03.125 --> 09:04.335
I'm not feeling it.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.670
Um, I don't see it.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.672
I'm sorry, do you--

09:07.713 --> 09:09.966
I could call it?
Oh, my God.

09:10.007 --> 09:11.133
What?

09:11.175 --> 09:13.511
I left it at the grocery store.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.721
I... (sighs)
I remember I set--

09:15.763 --> 09:18.099
I-I put my phone down
when I was paying,

09:18.140 --> 09:20.101
and then, and then I didn't
pick it back up.

09:20.142 --> 09:21.519
Which grocery store?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.521
Shoot, I don't remember
the name.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.064
It's-- I was there
right before I came here.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.941
It's, like, five minutes away.

09:26.983 --> 09:30.111
Starsky's?
Starsky's! Yes, that's it.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.237
Starsky's.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.072
I feel like
such an idiot.

09:33.114 --> 09:36.325
But, um, would you mind
driving me there real quick?

09:36.367 --> 09:38.494
I literally can't do anything
without my phone.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.496
Sure.

09:40.538 --> 09:41.872
Really?
Sure.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.666
Thank you.
I need some stuff anyway.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.543
And plus, they've got
a great butcher.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.004
Prosciutto will make a really
nice appetizer tonight anyhow.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.547
Oh, great.
Thank you.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.798
I really appreciate it.
Of course.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.508
Seriously, you have no idea.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.635
Okay, come on, Pretzel.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.682

10:08.941 --> 10:11.986

Ah. Well, just found out
that he lives next to a bank.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.867

So, they have
security-cam footage

10:17.908 --> 10:19.327

went to his apartment.

10:19.368 --> 10:20.911

19:00.514 --> 19:02.641
What does this have
to do with Murphy?

19:02.683 --> 19:04.935
It basically gave him
this complex that, like,

19:04.977 --> 19:06.562
no one would ever love him,

19:06.603 --> 19:09.898

19:12.526 --> 19:14.444

Yeah.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.907

my friends figured out

19:18.949 --> 19:20.492
that he'd do anything for them

19:20.534 --> 19:22.578
if they gave him
a little attention,

19:22.619 --> 19:27.583
so they'd, like, flirt with him
to get him to write their papers

19:27.624 --> 19:31.003
and college applications
and stuff.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.505

3:00 in the morning

19:33.547 --> 19:35.507
working his ass off
for these girls

19:35.549 --> 19:38.802

ever go out with him.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.182

about it because I didn't want

19:43.223 --> 19:45.601

I was a loser like him.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.856

19:53.859 --> 19:56.862
But I'm not anymore.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.655

all this for him,

19:58.697 --> 20:02.326
letting you guys stay here
and everything.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.870

trying to prove to him

20:04.912 --> 20:08.165

actually cares about him.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.628

20:12.669 --> 20:14.963

20:15.005 --> 20:16.965
She knows Felix
will do anything for her.

20:18.508 --> 20:19.676
But this time,
the worst that happens

20:19.718 --> 20:21.053
isn't that
he loses sleep.

20:21.094 --> 20:24.097
He would kill or die for her.

20:24.139 --> 20:26.475
And when she came
back here,

20:26.516 --> 20:28.977
I just saw all those girls
that treated him like garbage

20:29.019 --> 20:33.190
and I finally decided
to do something about it.

20:38.445 --> 20:40.030

21:26.702 --> 21:27.995

21:28.036 --> 21:29.204
for the people she loves.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.664

for Jess.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.583

to do the same.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.836

You said you thought
that if you could get

30:54.602 --> 30:57.689
to the bottom of Jenny's case
that you might find your friend.

30:57.730 --> 30:59.899
I assume
that's because your friend

30:59.941 --> 31:02.110
stole Jenny's identity, right?

31:02.151 --> 31:05.071
I'm a cardiologist.

31:05.113 --> 31:08.241
I saw Jennifer's name pop up
at Northern Presbyterian.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.743
So I went there.

31:10.785 --> 31:14.581
This girl had
all the same information.

31:14.622 --> 31:16.875
Birth date,
social security number,

31:16.916 --> 31:18.626
all of it.

31:18.668 --> 31:21.379
I tried to wake her up
to ask her how she got it,

31:21.421 --> 31:23.673
but she was too sedated.

31:23.715 --> 31:27.010
I went back the next day...

31:27.051 --> 31:29.262
but she was gone.

31:31.139 --> 31:34.559
So I hired a private
investigator to find her.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.979
I was worried that some girl
wandering around

31:38.021 --> 31:40.273
with Jenny's identity
would just get the police

31:40.315 --> 31:42.108
looking into her case again.

31:42.150 --> 31:44.027
And the-the private
investigator...

31:44.068 --> 31:47.238
Mm-hmm.
Mm, yeah, he found her.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.658
She was still using Jennifer's
social security number.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.952
But at that point she was
in a different state

31:52.994 --> 31:55.079
and going by a different name,
so I just thought

31:55.121 --> 31:58.041
it was more dangerous
to try to speak to her...

31:58.082 --> 32:00.376
so I let it go.
Where is she?

32:03.171 --> 32:06.883
I'll take you to her...

32:06.925 --> 32:10.219
if you promise not to
tell anyone about Jenny.

32:10.261 --> 32:13.056
You seriously want me
to keep quiet about

32:13.097 --> 32:15.224
the girl you're keeping
prisoner in your basement?

32:15.266 --> 32:18.436
Jenny is not a prisoner.
Jenny wants to be here.

32:18.478 --> 32:20.438
And if you want to see
your friend again, yes,

32:20.480 --> 32:21.940
you'll keep quiet about us.

32:21.981 --> 32:24.734
Look, I think you can tell

32:24.776 --> 32:27.570
that I don't want to hurt
anybody; I'm a good person.

32:27.612 --> 32:30.490
I would much rather
we both get what we need

32:30.531 --> 32:32.742

32:39.540 --> 32:43.252
I will find you,
wherever you are...

32:45.505 --> 32:47.256
...and I will kill you.

32:50.218 --> 32:52.178
So what do you think?

32:57.266 --> 33:00.812

33:00.853 --> 33:02.397

33:02.438 --> 33:06.275

drive us to Canada.

33:06.317 --> 33:08.194

33:41.102 --> 33:43.604
(gunshots)

33:43.646 --> 33:46.274
This morning, the dead body
of a guy who was at the shooting

33:46.315 --> 33:48.151
was found in a car
near Springfield.

33:50.528 --> 33:52.321
Oh, my God.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.407
(screams)

33:54.449 --> 33:56.784
Oh, my God.
The D.A. took over the case.

33:56.826 --> 33:59.579
But the gun in the car?
Registered to Lesley Bell.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.581
Felix Bell's sister.
Exactly.

34:01.622 --> 34:03.416
She's not exactly a known
cartel associate,

34:03.458 --> 34:04.584
so they just assumed
that the gun was stolen

34:04.625 --> 34:06.544
or she put it on
the black market.

34:06.586 --> 34:08.296
But that's not true.

34:08.337 --> 34:10.882
Trey's cell phone pinged
at Lesley's, remember?
Mm-hmm.

34:10.923 --> 34:12.717
He must have taken the gun
from her place.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.218
Which means that
they are staying there.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.762
We can't arrest Lesley

34:15.803 --> 34:17.638
since the gun wasn't used
to kill anyone.

34:17.680 --> 34:20.475
We can certainly get a search
warrant for her place, right?

34:20.516 --> 34:23.269
And if Murphy's there,
we arrest her.

34:24.562 --> 34:25.980
What?

34:26.022 --> 34:28.691
I just like when you get
all detectivey.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.026
You know,
it warms my heart.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.153
Shut up and call a judge.

34:32.195 --> 34:34.989
I love how you think
I wasn't gonna do that.

34:35.031 --> 34:36.574
I was just finishing
our conversation.

34:36.616 --> 34:38.076
Call the judge.

34:38.117 --> 34:39.452
Just respect for a conversation,
that's all it is.

34:39.494 --> 34:40.870
Shut up.

34:43.623 --> 34:46.417
I know dinner was
sort of ruined,

34:46.459 --> 34:48.920
but it was really good.

34:48.961 --> 34:51.506
Thank you.

34:53.633 --> 34:55.009
You okay?

34:55.051 --> 34:59.055
Yeah. He'll get over it.
Or not. It's fine.

Open the door!
What?

Oh, my God.
What the hell's going on?

35:10.775 --> 35:13.111
Shh! I have no idea.
(banging on door)

35:13.152 --> 35:15.446
Chicago P.D.
We know you're home.

35:15.488 --> 35:17.490
LESLEY:
Stay here, I'll get rid of them.

35:19.700 --> 35:22.203
Can I help you?

35:22.245 --> 35:23.412
We're looking for
Murphy Mason.

35:23.454 --> 35:24.705
Well, she's not here.

35:24.747 --> 35:26.874
Well, we'll just search
the place, then.

35:26.916 --> 35:29.210
Excuse me, do you have
a warrant?
Uh, we actually do.

35:29.252 --> 35:31.212
A gun registered in
your name was found

35:31.254 --> 35:32.672
at the site of
a triple homicide.

35:32.713 --> 35:34.090
You brought her gun to...
Max, stop.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.091
Do not say anything
right now.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.051
Look who it is.

35:37.093 --> 35:40.221
Murphy, you can
come on out, too.

35:40.263 --> 35:41.764
I told you she's not here.
JOSH:
Yeah, we'll see about that.

35:41.806 --> 35:43.349
In the meantime, you two
are under arrest.

35:43.391 --> 35:46.185
LESLEY: Hey, do you have
an arrest warrant as well?

35:46.227 --> 35:47.228
They agreed to turn
themselves in

35:47.270 --> 35:48.896
for the murder of Nia Bailey,

35:48.938 --> 35:50.439
then they fled the scene.
Oh, you mean the scene where

35:50.481 --> 35:51.816
you left their friend
in a burning building?

35:51.858 --> 35:53.985
A friend they told
you was in there.

35:54.026 --> 35:55.528
And let's not forget that
you probably don't even

35:55.570 --> 35:57.113
have this deal in writing,
so unless you have

35:57.155 --> 35:59.407
some other evidence
that I'm not aware of,

35:59.448 --> 36:00.908
seems like the only person
you can arrest for this

36:00.950 --> 36:03.452
is Murphy Mason,
and like I said, she's not here.

36:03.494 --> 36:05.163
JOSH:
All right, guys, fan out.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.834
Can you at least tell me
where we're going?

36:09.876 --> 36:11.919
Why? What are you gonna do?

36:11.961 --> 36:15.464
Are you gonna
drive us there yourself?

36:15.506 --> 36:18.885
(laughing)

36:18.926 --> 36:21.304
(indistinct radio chatter)

36:21.345 --> 36:22.847
No sign of her.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.223
JOSH:
Oh, my God, are you serious?

36:26.934 --> 36:28.102
You tell Murphy
we're gonna find her.

36:28.144 --> 36:31.147
Do you hear me?
We will never, ever

36:31.189 --> 36:33.566
stop looking for her,
and I'll personally see to it

36:33.608 --> 36:36.277
that she spends the rest
of her life in jail.

36:37.778 --> 36:39.530
That's a promise.

36:39.572 --> 36:41.407
I did it.
Felix!

36:41.449 --> 36:43.618
You what?
I killed Nia Bailey.

36:43.659 --> 36:47.163
I buried her body.
All of it.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.373
By myself.

36:49.415 --> 36:51.375
Come on.
I did!

36:51.417 --> 36:53.127
Felix, seriously, shut up.

36:53.169 --> 36:55.755
So leave Murphy alone.
Okay? I admit it.

36:55.796 --> 36:58.174
LESLEY:
Oh, my God.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.634
Are you gonna arrest me?

36:59.675 --> 37:01.302
Okay.

37:01.344 --> 37:04.347
Felix Bell,
you're under arrest

37:04.388 --> 37:06.182
for the murder of Nia Bailey.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.184
You have the right
to remain silent.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.977
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

37:10.019 --> 37:11.646
in a court of law.
LESLEY:
Seriously,

37:11.687 --> 37:12.980
do not say another word.
You have the right to...

37:13.022 --> 37:14.899
Keep your mouth shut.

37:14.941 --> 37:17.360
If you do not have an attorney,
we will appoint you one.

37:19.779 --> 37:21.530
Oh, my God.

37:21.572 --> 37:23.866
This is exactly what
I said would happen.

37:23.908 --> 37:25.409
Now I have to
get him out of it.

37:25.451 --> 37:27.203
Because there's no way
I'm letting him spend

37:27.245 --> 37:29.747
the rest of his life in jail
because of some dumb crush.

37:32.083 --> 37:35.169
(mid-tempo pop music playing)

37:35.211 --> 37:36.712
Hi, are you Jimmy?

37:36.754 --> 37:38.047
Sure am.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.173
Lesley Bell.
We spoke on the phone

37:39.215 --> 37:40.424
about the security footage.

37:40.466 --> 37:41.926
Right. You guys
can follow me.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.222
So this is the computer.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.057
Someone busted
our main camera last month,

37:48.099 --> 37:50.017
but the one here in the
storage room still works.

37:50.059 --> 37:52.103
Pretty simple.
You just rewind.

37:52.144 --> 37:53.813
Thank you, sir.
No problem.

37:53.854 --> 37:56.524
I'll just be at the bar
if you need me.

37:56.565 --> 37:59.944
All right, this could work.

37:59.986 --> 38:01.445
You guys were in here, right?

38:01.487 --> 38:03.406
Yeah.

38:03.447 --> 38:05.324
Yeah, Felix and me.

38:07.410 --> 38:10.121
There you guys are.

38:10.162 --> 38:12.248
You said Nia came in?

38:12.290 --> 38:14.375
Um, yeah, a few
seconds later.

38:14.417 --> 38:16.627
Or a couple minutes.
I don't know.

38:17.962 --> 38:19.297
Give me your gun.

38:19.338 --> 38:21.340
No, Nia...
You don't have to do this.

38:21.382 --> 38:22.717
NIA: Shut up.
VINCENT: Are you sure?

38:22.758 --> 38:24.343
I can do it.

38:24.385 --> 38:25.553
NIA:
I want to.

38:25.594 --> 38:28.431
No, wait, please.
Nia, wait!

38:28.472 --> 38:29.974
MAX:
Please!

38:31.309 --> 38:32.560
(gunshots)

38:32.601 --> 38:34.228
MAX:
No!

38:34.270 --> 38:38.190
No, God! No...

38:38.232 --> 38:40.067
Oh, my God. Thank God.
This--

38:40.109 --> 38:41.861
This proves
Felix didn't kill her.

38:41.902 --> 38:43.279
(laughs)

38:43.321 --> 38:46.574
(gasping)

38:46.615 --> 38:47.992
Hey.

38:48.034 --> 38:49.243
What is it?

38:49.285 --> 38:51.078
I need some air.
Hey, hey, hey...

38:53.331 --> 38:54.790
(door closes)

38:55.958 --> 39:00.338
Sorry. I didn't think that
might be hard to watch.

39:00.379 --> 39:03.049
I'm an idiot.

39:03.090 --> 39:06.385
It's okay.

39:06.427 --> 39:09.722
I know you're going
through a lot.

39:12.141 --> 39:13.893
And I know you just
want to pretend like

39:13.934 --> 39:17.480
none of this happened,
but it did.

39:17.521 --> 39:20.232
It sucks, but I think you
have to start dealing

39:20.274 --> 39:21.734
with some stuff.

39:24.904 --> 39:28.616
And if all this... us...

39:28.657 --> 39:31.952
is too much for you
right now, I totally...

39:31.994 --> 39:33.412
No.

39:33.454 --> 39:36.040
No, I-I want to be here.

39:38.250 --> 39:41.253
I want to be with you.

39:41.295 --> 39:44.423
I just need a little bit
of time. Okay?

39:44.465 --> 39:46.592
Okay.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.860
GENE:
Your sister sent this
over ten minutes ago.

40:04.902 --> 40:06.529
We know you didn't
shoot Nia.

40:06.570 --> 40:08.739
You heard the gunshots while
you were tied up in the back.

40:08.781 --> 40:12.660
Just like we've already proven,
we know it was Murphy.

40:12.701 --> 40:14.620
Uh...

40:14.662 --> 40:16.997
You just tell us where she is
and things will be much easier

40:17.039 --> 40:18.499
for both you and Murphy.

40:18.541 --> 40:22.962
Okay, I'll tell you.

40:25.131 --> 40:27.967
She's leaving...

40:29.718 --> 40:33.222
...on a midnight train...

40:33.264 --> 40:34.849
to Georgia.

40:34.890 --> 40:36.350
(Felix laughs)

40:36.392 --> 40:38.686
He's never gonna tell us
anything about Murphy.

40:38.727 --> 40:41.313
This is pointless.

40:43.149 --> 40:45.192
Please book him.

40:45.234 --> 40:46.819
On obstruction of justice.

40:46.861 --> 40:48.612
What? No.

40:48.654 --> 40:50.114
I can explain!

40:50.156 --> 40:51.740
I-I'll explain
the video!

40:51.782 --> 40:53.200
I'll explain it! Just-just
keep interrogating me.

40:53.242 --> 40:54.535
I'm your man!

41:06.088 --> 41:08.674
We're here.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.718
Where's here?

41:10.759 --> 41:13.804
It's a pet store.
Looks like it's still open.

41:13.846 --> 41:16.724
Not sure if she's
in there, but

41:16.765 --> 41:20.060
this is where she works,
last time I checked.

41:20.102 --> 41:23.189
What...
She-she what?

41:24.690 --> 41:26.859
Okay.

41:28.777 --> 41:30.362
Um, I'll be-be right back.

41:30.404 --> 41:32.156
