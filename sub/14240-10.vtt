WEBVTT

00:02.230 --> 00:03.630
Torchwood.

00:04.310 --> 00:07.090
Outside the
Government,beyond the police.

00:07.100 --> 00:10.180
Fighting for the future on
behalf of the human race.

00:11.280 --> 00:16.430
The 21st century is when everything
changes,and Torchwood is ready.

00:26.340 --> 00:29.260
Ladies and gentlemen,girls and boys,

00:29.270 --> 00:33.070
have we got a show for you tonight!

00:33.080 --> 00:37.200
A once in a lifetime show.

00:37.210 --> 00:41.400
Amaze your ears,astonish your eyes,

00:41.410 --> 00:46.070
then run along home and tell
your friends and neighbours.

00:46.110 --> 00:49.570
A once in a lifetime show,

00:49.580 --> 00:55.570
never to be forgotten for
the rest of your lives.

00:55.580 --> 01:01.330
So,why not step inside?

01:05.800 --> 01:08.640
We're waiting for you.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.780
Great!

02:23.620 --> 02:25.570
What is that?

02:38.250 --> 02:41.970
I know where you came from,mate,I
know where you're going.

03:24.630 --> 03:26.110
Tosh?

03:26.120 --> 03:27.540
I heard this sound.

03:27.550 --> 03:30.860
An old sound,like a pipe organ.

03:30.870 --> 03:32.050
A what?

03:32.060 --> 03:34.160
- Did you hear anything?
- No.

03:35.010 --> 03:38.500
Is there a circus in town,or a
travelling fair,something like that?

03:38.510 --> 03:40.510
On a night like this?

03:40.520 --> 03:42.260
They'd be wasting their time.

03:42.270 --> 03:43.420
Where's lanto? He'd know.

03:43.430 --> 03:48.810
He's gone to the cinema with Gwen and Owen,some
kind of opening night he wanted to check out.

03:48.820 --> 03:54.100
The building's got a record of rift
activity but it's been quiet for years so.

03:57.080 --> 04:00.880
- A nice trip to the cinema,you said.
- Yeah,that's right.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.680
lanto,nothing down here,mate.

04:03.690 --> 04:05.390
Oh,come on,Owen.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.830
It's more than just a cinema.

04:08.110 --> 04:09.550
It's the Electro!

04:24.570 --> 04:27.040
Where's that stupid bloody son of ours?

04:39.660 --> 04:41.430
He said he'd be here on time.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.250
He'd better be. He's got the film.

04:45.020 --> 04:48.160
And what good is a
cinema without a film?

04:49.030 --> 04:50.660
Good evening,gentlemen.

04:50.670 --> 04:51.960
Evening,madam.

04:53.080 --> 04:55.660
Welcome to the Electro.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.890
I love this place.

05:18.900 --> 05:20.280
Used to come here with my dad.

05:20.290 --> 05:22.400
They'd show kids' films
on Saturday morning.

05:22.410 --> 05:24.410
So where's the popcorn
and the ice cream?

05:24.420 --> 05:26.270
I think you've missed out.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.390
- It's educational.
- OK.

05:29.740 --> 05:30.740
Come on.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.880
- What time do you call this?
- Sorry.

05:33.890 --> 05:34.800
People are waiting.

05:34.810 --> 05:36.660
You won't believe this,but
when I was splicing the film.

05:36.670 --> 05:40.290
Just get up to that
projection room. Now!

05:59.630 --> 06:01.980
As proud owners of the Electro museum,

06:01.990 --> 06:07.690
it is our privilege to be able to show you how
the cinema and Hope Street looked in days gone by.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.630
If you watch carefully,who knows?

06:09.640 --> 06:14.150
You may even see long-dead members of
your family waiting in the cinema queue.

06:16.230 --> 06:18.110
Bernard!

06:45.560 --> 06:48.890
Do you recognise any of your
long-lost relatives,Gwen?

06:50.750 --> 06:52.510
There's Aunty Peggy.
She's been on the gin.

06:52.520 --> 06:53.970
Can you be quiet?

06:56.190 --> 06:59.270
He's showing the wrong bloody film!

07:01.910 --> 07:04.520
Where's Hope Street gone?

07:08.200 --> 07:10.250
Oh,shit!

07:24.110 --> 07:26.170
- Where the hell did that film come from?
- I've no idea.

07:26.180 --> 07:27.790
I swear I didn't edit those clips.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.380
- Don't be stupid.
- It's true.

07:29.390 --> 07:30.630
Just bloody well change it.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.590
I can't. The machine won't switch off.

07:32.600 --> 07:35.220
- Oh,get out of the way.
- This is crazy!

07:38.990 --> 07:43.410
It's the same pictures
over and over again.

07:43.900 --> 07:45.870
Yeah.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.630
Come on,let's go.

07:50.930 --> 07:52.630
Wait!

07:54.630 --> 07:56.420
- I just saw Jack.
- Where?

07:56.430 --> 07:57.920
In the film.

07:58.790 --> 07:59.940
- What are you talking about?
- What?

07:59.950 --> 08:01.930
I swear I saw him.

08:04.090 --> 08:06.480
- lanto.
- Wait. just wait.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.710
Come on. Let's go.

08:19.720 --> 08:22.410
Yes,come on. Are you coming?

09:01.080 --> 09:04.050
When the film stopped,these
shadows went past me.

09:04.060 --> 09:05.370
What kind of shadows?

09:05.380 --> 09:07.460
I don't know. It wasn't clear.

09:07.990 --> 09:10.100
There was something else.

09:10.110 --> 09:12.440
You were up there on the screen.

09:12.450 --> 09:14.580
As large as life.

09:14.590 --> 09:16.360
What was I doing?

09:16.380 --> 09:19.350
You were on some sort of stage.

09:19.360 --> 09:22.120
Outside a big tent.

09:22.130 --> 09:25.710
You seemed to be part
of a travelling show.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.310
I heard it.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.890
Heard its music.

09:31.900 --> 09:34.910
Just a snatch of it.

09:34.920 --> 09:37.960
That film was beautiful.

09:38.290 --> 09:42.100
All those acts performing for us.

09:42.110 --> 09:48.230
Part of history,trapped on film forever.

09:48.730 --> 09:51.450
Their days were numbered.

09:51.460 --> 09:57.130
Cinema may have saved their images,but
it finished off the travelling shows.

09:59.290 --> 10:01.710
Killed them.

10:08.290 --> 10:10.800
I'm at the bus stop,Mum.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.480
By Hope Street.

10:19.130 --> 10:21.350
No. Gemma's brother
couldn't bring me home.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.700
His car don't work.

10:25.220 --> 10:27.460
Well,what about Dad?

10:27.470 --> 10:31.090
Can't you wake him? Mum?

10:35.120 --> 10:39.300
Would you like a ticket for
the travelling show,my dear?

10:39.310 --> 10:40.450
No,thanks.

10:40.460 --> 10:43.270
Every young person's dream.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.900
Perhaps she'd like to
join the show instead.

10:49.010 --> 10:51.080
Why not?

10:51.090 --> 10:53.590
You could travel with us.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.720
Forever.

10:54.730 --> 10:57.240
Look,just go away,will you?

10:57.430 --> 10:59.330
Did you hear what I said?

11:15.470 --> 11:17.480
So you say the projector went haywire?

11:17.490 --> 11:20.510
Yeah,even with the mains switched
off it still kept running.

11:20.520 --> 11:21.820
Playing those film clips.

11:21.830 --> 11:24.150
It's like it had a mind of its own.

11:30.300 --> 11:31.740
- Working now.
- I know.

11:31.750 --> 11:32.770
Where did you get these?

11:32.780 --> 11:35.210
The basement. There were stacks of cans.

11:35.220 --> 11:39.430
I've been compiling old footage of Hope
Street and the Electro for the opening night.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.080
But the circus clips
weren't on it. I swear.

11:42.090 --> 11:43.980
The film that was shown
wasn't meant to be here?

11:43.990 --> 11:46.250
No,and that's what's so scary.

11:46.260 --> 11:48.720
I mean,it kind of played itself.

11:48.730 --> 11:50.290
It's like it wanted to be seen.

11:50.300 --> 11:52.470
Like something tried to get through?

11:53.260 --> 11:54.790
Yeah.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.900
And there was a sound,like
old fashioned music.

11:57.910 --> 12:00.070
Played on an organ or something.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.870
And there was a face looking out at me.

12:02.880 --> 12:06.360
And there was a smell,like.
Like bromine. Or iodine.

12:06.370 --> 12:07.940
Like film itself.

12:07.950 --> 12:09.710
That's right.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.360
- And this is the film?
- Yeah.

12:15.540 --> 12:19.230
Jack,the systems here
are behaving very oddly.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.010
And I heard the sound you mentioned.

12:21.020 --> 12:22.300
That fairground sound.

12:22.310 --> 12:23.920
Can you trace the source?

12:23.930 --> 12:28.020
No. But there was a peak in
rift activity at the Electro.

12:28.030 --> 12:29.070
Then nothing.

12:29.080 --> 12:32.330
Plus I'm recording
unusual rift traces nearby.

12:32.340 --> 12:33.330
Where?

12:33.340 --> 12:34.840
Chain Lane.

12:34.850 --> 12:37.080
Runs parallel to Hope Street.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.580
Sending the co-ordinates now.

12:44.920 --> 12:48.010
Tosh,we're on our way. Tell the
police we're dealing with it.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.130
Epileptic maybe?

13:05.140 --> 13:06.670
Could be wearing a tag.

13:06.680 --> 13:07.500
She isn't.

13:07.510 --> 13:08.390
She got ID?

13:08.400 --> 13:10.760
I'll check.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.030
What's wrong?

13:12.040 --> 13:14.780
She's got a heartbeat
but she isn't breathing.

13:14.790 --> 13:16.910
Shouldn't really be alive.

13:16.920 --> 13:19.100
And look at her mouth.

13:19.110 --> 13:20.830
She's got no saliva.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.890
Look,her lips are cracked.

13:22.900 --> 13:24.660
Dry as a bone.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.020
We need to get her to hospital.

14:13.970 --> 14:16.420
Sorry. We're closed.

14:16.780 --> 14:19.860
Do you hear me? We're closed.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.330
Make her cry.

14:22.340 --> 14:23.230
You what?

14:23.250 --> 14:26.310
I want to drink her tears.

14:38.530 --> 14:39.660
The name's Nettie Williams.

14:39.670 --> 14:40.640
Her parents are outside.

14:40.650 --> 14:41.990
She was visiting a friend.

14:42.010 --> 14:44.240
- Have any witnesses come forward?
- No.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.910
Has anyone been able
to communicate with her?

14:46.920 --> 14:49.710
No. No change in her condition.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.510
Motor response?

14:51.520 --> 14:54.240
Non-existent,they're
treating it as a coma.

14:54.250 --> 14:55.500
And they're wrong?

14:55.510 --> 14:56.390
Totally.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.870
There's no signs of cerebral
dysfunctions,no symptoms of hypoxia.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.580
And her body's dehydrated.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.380
You know when a spider sucks
the liquid out of its victims?

15:04.390 --> 15:09.250
Well,this is a bit like that,except
they've left her partly alive.

15:09.260 --> 15:12.080
She couldn't cry about it even
if she wanted to,the poor kid.

15:12.090 --> 15:14.260
She's got no tears.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.470
There's been another one.

15:19.150 --> 15:19.960
Who's she?

15:19.970 --> 15:20.860
We don't know.

15:20.870 --> 15:22.330
The paramedics found her.

15:22.340 --> 15:23.340
It freaked them.

15:23.360 --> 15:24.710
She was lying in an open doorway.

15:24.720 --> 15:26.110
Looking like this.

15:26.120 --> 15:26.840
Where was this?

15:26.850 --> 15:29.250
The corner of Hope Street.

15:32.020 --> 15:33.010
The same.

15:33.020 --> 15:35.660
Heartbeat but no breath.

15:35.670 --> 15:38.460
Her mouth's been drained of moisture.

15:39.260 --> 15:44.050
This makes no sense,they're almost dehydrated and
possibly brain dead yet somehow they're still with us.

15:44.060 --> 15:45.870
Some part of them has
been taken elsewhere?

15:45.880 --> 15:47.610
That's impossible.

15:48.290 --> 15:50.950
For the body to be alive there
must be a life force somewhere.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.840
Yet they've separated it,stolen it.

15:52.850 --> 15:53.990
Who has the power to do that?

15:54.000 --> 15:55.870
I don't know. But we
need to find out fast.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.730
Two people chosen at random.

15:57.740 --> 15:59.370
Who's next?

15:59.380 --> 16:01.600
Whatever's doing it has the
whole city to choose from.

16:01.610 --> 16:03.280
Or the world.

16:23.710 --> 16:25.690
I knew those two.

16:26.040 --> 16:29.140
They argued day and night.

16:31.880 --> 16:34.090
That is you.

16:40.170 --> 16:41.550
All right,now I've seen everything!

16:41.560 --> 16:42.480
I told you so.

16:42.490 --> 16:43.660
You did stand-up?

16:43.670 --> 16:45.190
I never did stand-up.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.070
OK,then. A song and dance.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.770
I was sensational!

16:48.780 --> 16:49.960
I don't believe this,Jack.

16:49.970 --> 16:51.430
What were you doing there?

16:51.440 --> 16:52.950
He was part of the freak show.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.290
Some things never change.

16:55.300 --> 16:57.560
Are you being rude about me?

16:58.830 --> 17:01.190
Look at the state of them.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.450
I do love his leotard.

17:07.380 --> 17:09.040
The night travellers.

17:09.050 --> 17:09.930
The what?

17:09.940 --> 17:12.720
Tosh,play that back.

17:17.230 --> 17:20.130
So,they did exist.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.050
Did you work with these people?

17:22.990 --> 17:26.869
I didn't work with them,I
never knew anyone who did.

17:26.880 --> 17:30.140
They only performed
in the dead of night.

17:31.390 --> 17:35.140
Anyway,it was just a tale
that was around at that time.

17:35.150 --> 17:37.600
A ghost story.

17:38.610 --> 17:41.660
They came from out of the rain.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.730
That's how people described them.

17:49.220 --> 17:50.760
Jack,what did these night travellers do?

17:50.770 --> 17:54.940
Left a trail of damage and
sorrow wherever they performed.

17:58.570 --> 18:00.630
Tosh,can you run this frame by frame?

18:00.640 --> 18:02.470
Er,sure.

18:03.170 --> 18:04.800
What are you looking for?

18:04.810 --> 18:07.080
I'm not sure.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.440
But something's wrong.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.590
Something's missing.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.110
This must be back,now,yeah?

18:15.120 --> 18:16.660
80 odd years.

18:16.670 --> 18:19.450
Then the travelling shows faded away.

18:19.460 --> 18:22.840
No-one came to watch them and without
an audience they died out. Forgotten.

18:23.200 --> 18:26.670
Until all we have to remember
them by were these film clips.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.350
Jack!

18:32.190 --> 18:34.180
This film. It's not the same
one we saw at the cinema.

18:34.190 --> 18:35.190
Course it's the same one.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.720
No,things are different. Tosh.

18:41.740 --> 18:46.110
Easy to miss at first,but after
watching it a few times I realised.

18:47.490 --> 18:48.540
Just there.

18:48.550 --> 18:51.560
There was a woman in
front of that water tank.

18:51.570 --> 18:53.570
Yeah there was,lanto,you're right.

18:53.580 --> 18:55.380
That's right,I remember her.

18:55.390 --> 18:58.000
Wearing almost nothing.

19:00.940 --> 19:03.530
And there was a man in
like a top hat,a sort of MC.

19:03.540 --> 19:05.170
Yeah. That's right.

19:05.180 --> 19:07.450
He was reaching down to the audience.

19:07.460 --> 19:09.880
Are you sure you brought
the right can of film back?

19:09.890 --> 19:10.510
Positive.

19:10.520 --> 19:11.810
So what are we saying?

19:11.820 --> 19:15.660
That two people from a piece
of film have decided to go AWOL?

19:15.670 --> 19:17.130
Yeah.

19:17.140 --> 19:21.150
Like you said,trapped in film forever.

19:21.340 --> 19:23.830
When they opened the
cinema,it gave them a chance.

19:23.840 --> 19:26.940
When that kid ran the
film,he let them loose.

19:26.960 --> 19:32.390
So they've become physical?
They've escaped the film?

19:34.550 --> 19:38.150
We need to find out more about
the havoc they caused in the past.

19:38.160 --> 19:39.640
We need evidence.

19:39.660 --> 19:40.710
Possible witnesses.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.130
After all that time it'll be tricky.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.020
What,town and parish records?

19:44.030 --> 19:45.430
Sure,we can do that.

19:45.440 --> 19:47.000
How far back do you want us to go?

19:47.010 --> 19:49.360
As far as you can.

19:50.050 --> 19:51.640
We don't sleep till we find them.

19:51.650 --> 19:54.390
Toshiko,keep checking for sightings.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.700
There's got to be a way of tracing them.

19:55.710 --> 19:57.650
lanto,with me,I need
your local knowledge.

19:57.660 --> 20:00.860
Oh,is that what you're
calling it these days?

20:04.880 --> 20:09.070
So,two people who should
have been dead for years.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.650
What kind of creatures are they?

20:11.660 --> 20:14.490
No-one ever knew the night
travellers were coming.

20:14.890 --> 20:17.590
They'd just appear from nowhere.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.710
Not like the team I was with.

20:18.720 --> 20:23.770
We'd send out flyers,bang
drums,blow whistles.

20:26.860 --> 20:29.320
Ours was a small company.

20:29.330 --> 20:31.010
Working the UK.

20:31.020 --> 20:33.920
Trying to find paying customers.

20:35.480 --> 20:40.280
I was sent to investigate
rumours of the night travellers.

20:40.290 --> 20:41.790
By who?

20:41.800 --> 20:43.910
Long story.

20:44.340 --> 20:47.320
So I joined a travelling show.

20:47.910 --> 20:51.680
I was billed as the
man who couldn't die.

20:53.250 --> 20:57.050
The night travellers
always found an audience.

20:57.550 --> 21:00.170
They knew where to look.

21:00.470 --> 21:03.840
Step along now,ladies and gentlemen,

21:03.850 --> 21:09.790
come and see the show of a lifetime!

21:10.810 --> 21:16.510
Fill your eyes with the
spectacle of the tattooed man!

21:19.050 --> 21:24.870
Witness for yourself
the superhuman strength

21:24.880 --> 21:29.200
of the Mighty Stromboli!

21:30.440 --> 21:35.830
He can take on
Samson,Goliath and Hercules

21:35.840 --> 21:39.000
with one arm tied behind his back,

21:39.010 --> 21:43.570
and still have strength
to dig their graves.

21:46.190 --> 21:51.880
Come along now,ladies and
gentlemen,the night won't wait forever.

21:52.480 --> 21:58.640
Come and see the amazing Pearl!

22:01.610 --> 22:05.390
She lives in water.

22:05.400 --> 22:08.800
She sleeps among the waves.

22:08.810 --> 22:13.730
She can reach the bottom of the oceans.

22:13.740 --> 22:18.150
She has swum the seven seas.

22:18.430 --> 22:23.480
She is the nearest thing
that you will ever see

22:24.130 --> 22:28.230
to a living mermaid.

22:30.180 --> 22:36.310
She will take your breath away.

22:41.340 --> 22:43.600
How many other old cinemas
are there in Cardiff?

22:43.610 --> 22:46.150
Most of them have been pulled down.

22:48.220 --> 22:50.020
And the ones that are left?

22:50.030 --> 22:51.640
Converted.

22:51.650 --> 22:53.570
This one is a pub.

22:53.580 --> 22:57.530
Four-pint jugs for a fiver
and girls in free before 11.

22:59.940 --> 23:01.840
I'm registering the sea!

23:03.430 --> 23:04.960
The sea?

23:04.970 --> 23:06.660
Inland?

23:08.340 --> 23:11.360
Running through the centre of town?

23:27.780 --> 23:29.470
What is it?

23:29.480 --> 23:30.500
I thought.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.780
I thought I saw something.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.220
Saw what?

23:35.230 --> 23:36.990
Ghosts.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.930
Don't be stupid.

23:40.930 --> 23:43.100
So the Electro is the only one left.

23:43.110 --> 23:45.270
Could the night travellers
have performed there?

23:45.280 --> 23:46.580
Possibly.

23:46.590 --> 23:51.220
If cinema killed the travelling show,maybe
this is their way of fighting back.

23:51.580 --> 23:57.650
Their only chance to escape before every
old movie theatre and piece of film has gone.

23:59.720 --> 24:02.190
What better way to get revenge?

24:03.100 --> 24:06.730
They were left
forgotten,on pieces of film.

24:06.740 --> 24:09.210
And now they're looking
for a new audience.

24:11.490 --> 24:12.530
What is it,Tosh?

24:12.540 --> 24:14.730
She was picking up the sea.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.780
In the middle of town.

24:16.790 --> 24:18.810
It's gone now.

24:20.230 --> 24:22.490
I was getting the sound of waves.

24:22.500 --> 24:24.530
Seagulls.

24:25.140 --> 24:27.500
I could almost smell the ozone.

24:27.510 --> 24:29.990
- No other sightings?
- No.

24:30.810 --> 24:33.340
What the hell are they up to?

24:56.320 --> 24:58.290
I like the lights.

24:58.300 --> 25:00.760
They make the rain glisten.

25:00.770 --> 25:03.490
And they're part of us.

25:26.920 --> 25:29.490
Smell the water.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.770
Taste it.

25:35.470 --> 25:37.920
Careful.

25:37.930 --> 25:39.690
How many now?

25:39.700 --> 25:42.080
Six.

25:42.090 --> 25:45.310
I wish I could see the
air they once breathed.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.280
You know you can never see it.

25:47.290 --> 25:49.750
We could never see it.

25:49.760 --> 25:52.140
We have their ghosts here.

25:52.150 --> 25:55.160
I can see them whenever I want.

25:55.170 --> 25:57.610
Our audience.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.950
They'll never leave us.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.950
We can't see.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.830
But we can hear. Listen.

26:07.720 --> 26:09.470
I can!

26:09.480 --> 26:11.620
I can hear them.

26:11.630 --> 26:15.840
Little last breaths,still
sighing their sighs.

26:16.820 --> 26:19.260
Can we bring the others?

26:19.270 --> 26:22.140
Make ghosts forever?

26:22.940 --> 26:26.710
The others shouldn't be
in some old dark cupboard.

26:26.720 --> 26:29.770
They should be here with us.

26:29.780 --> 26:34.120
And I want to travel again,perform.

26:34.130 --> 26:36.390
All right.

26:36.880 --> 26:39.980
But first we need the rest of that film.

26:56.290 --> 27:00.160
Found in a car with their
parents,near Hope Street.

27:03.140 --> 27:05.000
Oh,no.

27:08.540 --> 27:09.880
What happened to the parents?

27:09.890 --> 27:12.880
They're in the same cataleptic state.

27:14.130 --> 27:16.280
They came from out of the rain.

27:16.290 --> 27:18.140
What did you say?

27:18.150 --> 27:20.120
Nothing.

27:20.630 --> 27:21.530
Why?

27:21.540 --> 27:23.570
Those words,'From out of the rain'.

27:23.580 --> 27:25.990
I'm sure I've heard them before.

27:26.370 --> 27:29.320
Oh,I remember,it was
Christina. She was a patient.

27:29.330 --> 27:30.240
Here?

27:30.250 --> 27:33.700
No,at Providence Park,it's
a psychiatric hospital.

27:33.710 --> 27:35.160
I know it.

27:35.170 --> 27:36.990
I used to work there.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.720
She was a full-time patient,been
there since she was a child.

27:41.730 --> 27:44.360
She was a strange one.

27:44.370 --> 27:49.240
Whenever anything,any kind of entertainment
show was laid on,she became scared.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.450
She'd run away and hide.

27:51.460 --> 27:53.960
Did she say why?

27:53.970 --> 27:58.300
Yes. She said they were coming
to steal her last breath.

27:59.300 --> 28:01.050
Poor love.

28:04.600 --> 28:08.130
I think we've just found
ourselves our first witness.

28:08.770 --> 28:11.840
They came from out
of the rain. At night.

28:11.850 --> 28:13.920
Came to the village.

28:13.930 --> 28:15.880
How old were you at the time?

28:15.890 --> 28:18.590
Oh,just a child.

28:18.600 --> 28:22.180
Five,I think,or six.

28:23.010 --> 28:25.830
Are you visiting someone?

28:26.030 --> 28:29.540
Christina,we've come to see you.

28:29.550 --> 28:33.010
No one comes to see me.

28:35.610 --> 28:40.130
Your eyes are older than your face.

28:40.790 --> 28:41.840
Is that a bad thing?

28:41.850 --> 28:42.930
Yes.

28:42.940 --> 28:45.560
It means you don't belong.

28:45.570 --> 28:49.270
It means you're from nowhere.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.700
Christina,tell us about them.

28:53.710 --> 28:56.900
The people who came out of the rain.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.570
There was music.

29:00.580 --> 29:02.660
Hurdy-gurdy music.

29:02.970 --> 29:05.450
Acrobats.

29:05.840 --> 29:09.410
And a man with fire in his hands.

29:09.420 --> 29:11.380
Who else was there?

29:11.390 --> 29:16.920
A man in dark clothes,and a woman.

29:16.940 --> 29:20.650
A beautiful young woman
in a silvery costume.

29:20.660 --> 29:23.590
She seemed to glisten.

30:18.940 --> 30:21.740
They touched you,I can sense it.

30:21.750 --> 30:25.020
They touched you as they passed you by.

30:25.030 --> 30:27.780
Tell us about the man,Christina.

30:28.940 --> 30:31.040
He spoke to me.

30:31.050 --> 30:36.230
He asked if I would like
to join the travelling show.

30:36.240 --> 30:40.430
He took a kind of
flask out of his pocket.

30:40.700 --> 30:44.730
It was polished like silver.

30:45.660 --> 30:48.450
I asked him his name.

30:48.460 --> 30:51.990
Oh,I shall never forget it.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.490
I never shall.

30:54.500 --> 30:58.340
He said he was the ghost maker.

30:58.350 --> 31:04.510
He wanted to take my breath
and put it in his flask.

31:04.520 --> 31:09.650
He said I could travel with his circus,

31:09.990 --> 31:13.360
I would be in his audience forever.

31:13.690 --> 31:17.900
I turned and ran away
as fast as I could.

31:20.610 --> 31:25.040
People went missing from
the village that night.

31:25.750 --> 31:29.770
My mother,my father.

31:32.740 --> 31:33.920
Here we go.

31:33.930 --> 31:36.040
Church Stretton,1901.

31:36.050 --> 31:40.890
People went missing when a travelling show
visited the town,and there was one earlier on.

31:40.900 --> 31:45.910
1898,a small village called Wellsfield.

31:45.920 --> 31:50.660
These disappearances,there's a lot of old
wives' tales attached to them through the years.

31:50.670 --> 31:53.240
People still alive but
been deprived of breath,

31:53.250 --> 31:56.820
children being told to hold their breath
while the travelling show passes by.

31:56.850 --> 31:58.840
Yeah,this local paper,didn't
take it seriously.

31:59.600 --> 32:02.030
Hunstanton Chronicle,March 1911.

32:02.040 --> 32:05.380
"Police and doctors were left amused and
baffled when Mr Alfred Mace insisted that

32:05.390 --> 32:09.710
his dead wife could be brought back to life
providing a certain flask could be found. "

32:09.720 --> 32:12.530
He reckoned his wife's last
breath had been put in a flask.

32:12.540 --> 32:13.860
A silver flask.

32:13.870 --> 32:16.100
And the last breath of each victim.

32:16.110 --> 32:17.700
So that's how he makes his ghosts.

32:17.720 --> 32:19.190
So if we find the flask.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.880
We can save them.

33:43.390 --> 33:45.790
Now we have the film.

33:49.840 --> 33:52.390
Time to bring the others.

34:02.040 --> 34:06.600
Jack,this is Jonathan,they're here,they're
at my flat,you've got to get over here now!

34:22.270 --> 34:23.250
Who was in there?

34:23.260 --> 34:24.850
A woman,lying under water.

34:24.860 --> 34:26.530
- I thought she'd drowned.
- Anyone else?

34:26.540 --> 34:27.850
No.

34:38.570 --> 34:40.290
Be careful.

35:04.710 --> 35:06.620
Did Bernard say he
was coming here today?

35:06.630 --> 35:08.300
No.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.270
David.

35:42.650 --> 35:44.640
This way,please.

35:46.870 --> 35:48.800
So they haven't left the area.

35:48.810 --> 35:50.690
They probably can't.

35:50.700 --> 35:52.480
Probably need to be near the Electro.

35:52.490 --> 35:54.480
All my old film cans have been opened.

35:54.490 --> 35:55.620
What was on them?

35:55.630 --> 35:58.240
Clips from circus sideshows.

35:58.250 --> 36:00.460
They're bringing more through.

36:02.090 --> 36:04.120
Then we need to stop them.

36:04.130 --> 36:05.620
Gwen,Owen.

36:05.630 --> 36:06.690
Meet us at the Electro.

36:06.700 --> 36:07.650
Look,what's going on?

36:07.660 --> 36:08.960
I've got to find my Mum and Dad.

36:08.970 --> 36:10.990
If anything's happened to them.

36:11.400 --> 36:12.780
Hey,there's that smell again.

36:12.790 --> 36:14.110
Like chemicals.

36:14.120 --> 36:16.130
Yeah,I can smell it.

36:16.140 --> 36:17.820
Like when you develop a film.

36:17.830 --> 36:19.430
That woman.

36:19.440 --> 36:20.930
She grabbed me.

36:20.940 --> 36:22.840
But her hand,it was different.

36:22.850 --> 36:24.820
It wasn't like a hand.
It wasn't like flesh.

36:24.830 --> 36:31.100
It was it was like touching a piece
of plastic,a piece of celluloid.

36:31.110 --> 36:33.720
They were on this film for 80 years.

36:34.700 --> 36:37.160
Became part of it.

36:37.170 --> 36:38.730
What if we filmed them?

36:38.740 --> 36:41.000
- A film of a film?
- Yeah.

36:42.520 --> 36:44.160
Then they'd be trapped.

36:44.170 --> 36:45.220
Is this thing loaded?

36:45.230 --> 36:47.140
If they were trapped on film before.

36:47.150 --> 36:49.110
They can be got rid of in the same way.

36:49.750 --> 36:52.390
Let's suppose they're made
of camphor and nitrate,

36:52.400 --> 36:54.780
made of shadows,made of
light. Just enough light.

36:54.790 --> 36:56.090
We film them.

36:56.100 --> 36:57.030
Capture them in that.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.200
Then expose the film to
as much light as possible.

36:59.210 --> 37:01.460
Of course. We'd blank
them out,we'd lose them.

37:01.470 --> 37:02.310
Let's hope so.

37:02.320 --> 37:03.940
- Jack?
- Yeah?

37:03.950 --> 37:06.340
We're at the Electro.
Something's happening inside.

37:06.350 --> 37:07.970
Let's go.

37:14.200 --> 37:14.960
Do you hear that?

37:14.970 --> 37:16.050
Maybe it's my mam and dad.

37:16.060 --> 37:18.020
- Would they lock themselves in?
- No.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.690
Please let them be OK. Please.

37:25.640 --> 37:28.250
- Mum?Dad?
- Take it easy.

37:32.820 --> 37:34.110
What's going on?

37:34.120 --> 37:35.690
Mum?

37:37.560 --> 37:40.350
- No,Jonathan.
- Mum!Dad!

37:40.680 --> 37:43.740
What's happened? Please!

37:43.750 --> 37:45.550
Don't die,please!

37:45.560 --> 37:47.580
Speak to me!

37:48.210 --> 37:50.100
No! Leave me alone!

37:50.790 --> 37:55.020
They've been frozen in place,a
circus needs an audience.

38:00.110 --> 38:01.860
Get him out of here.

38:01.870 --> 38:04.630
- Jonathan,come on.
- Leave me alone.

38:04.640 --> 38:07.120
Owen,find out who's upstairs.

38:18.240 --> 38:20.730
The same pictures as before.

38:39.410 --> 38:41.070
Jack.

38:52.780 --> 38:55.080
They're coming through.

39:07.470 --> 39:08.740
Open up!

39:08.750 --> 39:09.870
We've done it.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.650
We're together again.

39:11.660 --> 39:12.730
This place is ours.

39:12.740 --> 39:14.020
It belongs to us.

39:14.030 --> 39:17.230
This whole city belongs to us!

39:28.050 --> 39:30.300
What are you?

39:30.310 --> 39:33.980
There's not a breath
in your poor,sad body.

39:34.630 --> 39:37.220
You're no use to me.

39:40.040 --> 39:41.580
The flask! He's got it!

39:43.480 --> 39:45.010
I've got it!

39:50.430 --> 39:51.960
Gwen,are you all right?

39:52.610 --> 39:53.570
- Are you OK?
- Yes!

39:53.580 --> 39:55.630
Owen,look after the family.

40:22.930 --> 40:25.380
No! Please!

40:27.580 --> 40:31.250
If their breaths escaped the
flask all the victims will die.

40:38.230 --> 40:40.420
Quick! We could lose them forever!

40:51.150 --> 40:53.490
They're flat-lining,call
the crash team.

40:57.120 --> 40:58.870
One.

40:58.880 --> 41:01.180
I think we saved just one.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.430
I hear it,Jack.

41:07.910 --> 41:12.800
I heard it,something
inside calling out to me.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.980
So we managed to save one.

41:25.770 --> 41:27.940
But which one?

41:28.340 --> 41:29.960
There was nothing we could do.

41:29.970 --> 41:32.780
They all died so suddenly.

41:33.390 --> 41:36.280
Except this poor little soul.

41:46.880 --> 41:49.720
I suppose he'll be next to go.

41:50.410 --> 41:51.800
What are you doing?

41:51.810 --> 41:53.610
I need your help.

41:54.310 --> 41:55.290
What is that thing?

41:55.300 --> 41:57.730
Please. Just trust me.

41:58.050 --> 41:59.040
Give me a hand.

41:59.050 --> 42:00.670
Careful.

42:02.100 --> 42:03.920
Hold his head.

42:05.420 --> 42:06.350
What's in there?

42:06.360 --> 42:08.430
Something that belongs to him.

42:08.440 --> 42:12.280
His last breath,his life.

42:25.700 --> 42:27.670
What have you done to him?

42:33.260 --> 42:35.610
It worked.

42:35.810 --> 42:37.810
Welcome back.

43:01.630 --> 43:04.730
Those reels of film
in Jonathan's workroom.

43:04.740 --> 43:07.780
I took them out,destroyed them.

43:09.620 --> 43:12.940
Let's hope that's an end to it.

43:12.950 --> 43:16.370
What worries me are all those
long lost pieces of film,

43:16.400 --> 43:20.640
tucked away in dusty
cellars,hidden in lofts.

43:20.650 --> 43:24.640
The night travellers could
still be there,somewhere.

43:24.650 --> 43:26.780
Just waiting.

43:50.290 --> 43:52.610
How much is this?

44:27.400 --> 44:28.270
Jonah Bevan.

44:28.280 --> 44:30.360
Disappeared walking home
from football practice.

44:30.370 --> 44:31.460
Why is this one so special?

44:31.470 --> 44:33.760
Something's glowing,just out
of the camera's line of sight.

44:33.770 --> 44:36.090
Cardiff has an epidemic
of missing persons.

44:36.100 --> 44:37.210
Oh,my God.

44:37.220 --> 44:39.330
I'll make it my own special project.

44:39.340 --> 44:41.330
- No,leave it alone.
- I can't.

44:41.340 --> 44:43.020
He's got to be out there somewhere.

44:43.030 --> 44:44.550
Can we keep this to ourselves?

44:44.560 --> 44:46.850
You're covering it up,in
the Bristol Channel?

44:46.860 --> 44:49.500
What if the rift doesn't
just leave stuff behind?

44:49.510 --> 44:51.150
What if it also takes?

44:51.160 --> 44:52.330
What's your mate doing there?

44:52.340 --> 44:53.890
Any reason you'd be on
the barrage that night?

44:53.900 --> 44:55.180
Close this down!
