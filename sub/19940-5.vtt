Beautiful printing.

I've got a pretty mean

Brearley and Bryn Mawr,
I have no doubt.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.620
So, you're prepping
for Christmas?

01:45.660 --> 01:47.710
The display department
always likes to get a nice jump.

01:47.750 --> 01:50.420
Never too early
to scout for Santas.

01:50.460 --> 01:52.090
Lots of jolly choices out there.

01:52.130 --> 01:53.960
Oh, we screen them
fresh every year.

01:54.010 --> 01:56.970
Make sure they're still plump,
still personable, still sober.

01:57.010 --> 01:58.760
So much to think about.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.260
So, you majored
in Russian Literature.

02:00.300 --> 02:02.260
With a minor in Education.
For a split second,

02:02.310 --> 02:03.680
I thought about being
a grammar school teacher.

02:03.720 --> 02:06.690
-What happened?
-I met some grammar school kids.

02:06.730 --> 02:08.100
(Midge chuckles)

02:08.139 --> 02:09.979
No, seriously, I married
straight out of college

02:10.020 --> 02:12.070
and had children of my own.
Two, actually.

02:12.110 --> 02:13.690
Started my own grammar school,
if you will.

02:13.730 --> 02:16.070
And you're here for our
elevator operator position?

02:16.110 --> 02:17.030
Yes, sir.

02:17.070 --> 02:19.490
We usually hire men
for that job.

02:19.530 --> 02:21.580
Oh. The ad didn't say.

02:21.620 --> 02:23.080
I just think that
our lady shoppers

02:23.120 --> 02:25.370
-prefer men in the position.
-I get that.

02:25.410 --> 02:26.960
Not a lot of practical
work experience

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
on your résumé, either.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.960
But lots of volunteer work.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.380
It's all listed there.
I was a candy striper.

02:31.420 --> 02:32.920
And in high school,
I helped raise money

02:32.960 --> 02:35.460
to start a gymnastics program,
the Zion Orphanage in Jerusalem.

02:35.510 --> 02:37.760
-Raised $700.
-Impressive.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.340
Lots of little Jews
tumbling around because of me.

02:40.390 --> 02:42.390
Mrs. Maisel, you are
a very delightful woman,

02:42.430 --> 02:45.060
but I'm not sure that being
an elevator operator

02:45.100 --> 02:47.480
is the right fit for you.
I'm sorry.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.350
Oh, but I-I have such
a passion for it.

02:49.390 --> 02:51.230
I grew up with one
in my building,

02:51.270 --> 02:52.690
my sweet Jerry,

02:52.730 --> 02:54.270
So, in a way,
I feel as if my whole life

02:54.320 --> 02:56.740
-has been leading up to this.
-Your whole life?

02:56.780 --> 02:58.400
And I really hit it off
with Darren on the way up.

02:58.450 --> 02:59.820
Lots of informative shoptalk.

02:59.860 --> 03:00.990
Darren is very personable.

03:01.030 --> 03:02.910
And the uniform.
Picture me in that hat

03:02.950 --> 03:04.950
and the coat with a tapered
waist. I mean, come on.

03:04.990 --> 03:07.040
Thank you for coming in.

03:07.080 --> 03:10.080

WOMAN: I just go through periods
where nothing looks good.

03:29.020 --> 03:30.440
WOMAN 2: Well, that's not true
and you know it.

03:30.480 --> 03:31.850
WOMAN 1: I guess I can
just stick with red.

03:31.900 --> 03:33.360
Can't go too wrong there.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.110
WOMAN 2: Well, you could try
a dark pink lipstick, too.

03:35.150 --> 03:37.030
That might work better with the
pink you picked for your rouge.

03:37.070 --> 03:39.320
Oh, please. I just worked up
the courage to wear red

03:39.360 --> 03:42.030
in a vain attempt to look
like Leslie Caron in Gigi.

03:42.070 --> 03:43.740
-Oh.
-Red works great with pink.

03:43.780 --> 03:45.160
Pardon me?

03:45.200 --> 03:47.370
And it's terrific
with your complexion.

03:47.410 --> 03:49.660
You have some natural rosiness.
Just be sure to pick a tone

03:49.700 --> 03:51.080
that doesn't augment
that too much.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.080
Keep it subtle.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.210
I like subtle.

03:53.250 --> 03:54.920
That's Raven Red.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.090
Try Cherries in the Snow.

03:56.130 --> 03:57.380
That'll get you close to Caron.

03:57.420 --> 03:58.760
Oh, I like that.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.420
-(laughing): A lot.
-I do, too.

18:02.390 --> 18:04.520
MIDGE:
Oh. So he's funny.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.060
Him you laugh at. All right.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.810
Okay, just-just getting
the lay of the land here.

18:08.850 --> 18:10.020
You want to come up?

18:10.060 --> 18:11.230
Oh.

18:11.270 --> 18:12.820
Yeah, didn't think so.

18:12.860 --> 18:14.110
Really? You're not-you're
not gonna turn

18:14.150 --> 18:15.320
the spotlight back on?

18:15.360 --> 18:17.740
Can't find the switch?

18:17.780 --> 18:21.620
My underwear suddenly feels
very tight. (laughs)

18:21.660 --> 18:23.540
(exhales)

18:23.580 --> 18:24.620
Well.

18:24.660 --> 18:26.080
Uh, thanks, everybody.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.120
It's been delightful.

18:30.750 --> 18:32.880
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You still got more time.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.550
Well, give my time
to someone else.

18:34.590 --> 18:36.720
This isn't fucking Congress.
Get back up there.

18:36.760 --> 18:40.140
No. And fix the fucking mic,
it won't come off the stand.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.770
Sorry about that, everyone.

18:49.810 --> 18:52.730
Uh, we're gonna take a little
break to clear the stink.

18:52.770 --> 18:54.150
(laughter)

18:54.190 --> 18:55.780
And we'll be back in 20.

18:55.820 --> 18:57.280
Jesus.

18:57.320 --> 18:59.110
What is wrong with these people?

18:59.150 --> 19:01.620
Absolutely nothing
is wrong with these people.

19:01.660 --> 19:05.160
Nothing? They're unconscious.
They're lying in state.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.620
And who is heckling me?

19:06.660 --> 19:08.160
There was another comic
up there an hour ago.

19:08.210 --> 19:09.460
He killed. Same audience.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.040
No. Uh-uh, no way.

19:11.080 --> 19:13.250
You stunk tonight, lady.
That's all it was.

19:13.290 --> 19:15.670
No, Susie, this fucking audience
could hardly lift their heads

19:15.710 --> 19:17.840
-up off the table long enough...
-The audience was fine.

19:17.880 --> 19:19.590
You bombed.
You took out Antwerp.

19:19.630 --> 19:21.260
-I bombed?
-People were asking

19:21.300 --> 19:22.390
for directions
to a fallout shelter.

19:22.430 --> 19:23.680
You bombed.

19:23.720 --> 19:26.720
-But I'm funny.
-Everybody bombs.

19:26.770 --> 19:29.140
But I've seen Rickles
five times. He's never bombed.

19:29.180 --> 19:31.270
The guys go on Jack Paar,
they never bomb.

19:31.310 --> 19:32.690
Yeah, that's 'cause
they've spent years bombing

19:32.730 --> 19:34.570
and honing their act so
you don't have to see them bomb.

19:34.610 --> 19:35.730
They've bombed, believe me.

19:35.770 --> 19:37.610
Well, I'm not gonna bomb again.

19:37.650 --> 19:39.820
No, you're gonna bomb again
and again and again and again.

19:39.860 --> 19:41.530
Why would anyone do this
if they're just gonna bomb

19:41.570 --> 19:43.160
again and again and again?

19:43.200 --> 19:44.780
Because it's part
of the process.

19:44.830 --> 19:46.120
Yeah, well, it's not part
of my process.

19:47.370 --> 19:49.460
Shit.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.750
I've only done this
drunk or stoned.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.420
What-what if that's
the only reason I was funny?

19:53.460 --> 19:55.130
Like, I can't get loaded
every time I come on stage.

19:55.170 --> 19:57.170
You never met a comic?

19:57.210 --> 19:58.420
All right, here.
Go smoke a cigarette.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.420
No, I'm not gonna
go smoke a cigarette.

20:00.470 --> 20:01.970
I feel devastated.

20:02.010 --> 20:03.510
I've never felt this devastated.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.800
You mean, besides
when your husband left you.

20:05.850 --> 20:08.100
-Give me a cigarette.
-Next time, prepare a little.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.640
Spontaneity works
until it doesn't work.

20:09.680 --> 20:10.850
Then you're stuck.

20:10.890 --> 20:12.230
Prepare.

20:12.270 --> 20:14.360
All right.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.810
Right.

20:20.190 --> 20:22.820
-Fuck. -MORT SAHL:
So we went to this cabdriver,

20:22.860 --> 20:24.660
and, uh, I don't want you
to think we're like that,

20:24.700 --> 20:26.740
you know, but you must remember
what men are like in war,

20:26.780 --> 20:28.370
-it's that kind of a show
tonight. -(laughter)

20:28.410 --> 20:30.790
So we went to this cabdriver,
and we said to him,

20:30.830 --> 20:32.250
"Where's the action?"

20:32.290 --> 20:34.920
-This kind of masculine,
sort of... -(laughter)

20:34.960 --> 20:40.010
So, so he took us to this place
where they fish illegally.

20:40.050 --> 20:42.050
-See, now you're not supposed...

21:25.300 --> 21:27.260
Sal, Sal, we sold plastic stuff

21:27.300 --> 21:29.180
to people that don't actually
need plastic stuff.

21:29.220 --> 21:31.600
Yeah. See-see, that's what
salesmanship is, Sally.

21:31.640 --> 21:34.890
-Mm-hmm. -Selling things
to people that they don't want.

21:34.940 --> 21:37.100

21:44.570 --> 21:46.450

Samuel Beckett's next play.

21:46.490 --> 21:47.610

21:56.790 --> 21:58.420
Hey, Pen.

21:58.460 --> 22:01.420
Yeah, a certain young man
did send you some flowers.

22:21.980 --> 22:23.940
Penny's young. Penny will learn.

22:23.980 --> 22:25.490
She's meeting the parents
this week.

22:25.530 --> 22:27.070
(laughing):
Oh! Big stuff.

22:27.110 --> 22:28.700
She's pretty nervous.

22:28.740 --> 22:30.320
She doesn't have anything
to be nervous about.

Yeah.

22:35.950 --> 22:38.460
And she's all excited about
seeing The Music Man next week.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.330
Oh, man, we've been dying
to see that show.

22:40.380 --> 22:41.540
Especially Imogene.

22:41.590 --> 22:42.630
How'd you get tickets?

22:42.670 --> 22:44.250
I got friends in high places.

22:44.300 --> 22:45.550
You're the man.

22:45.590 --> 22:48.220
You know, I scored four seats,

22:48.260 --> 22:50.640
so I don't know, if you and
Imogene want to tag along...?

22:50.680 --> 22:52.890
Are you kidding? Imogene would
cancel surgery to see that show.

22:52.930 --> 22:54.470
Yes, we will go.

22:54.520 --> 22:55.680
You want to know what night?
You may have plans.

22:55.720 --> 22:56.850
Whatever's planned is canceled.

22:56.890 --> 22:58.060
-We're going.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.170
So, tell me why you called.

24:51.220 --> 24:53.260
I'm looking to hone an act.

24:53.300 --> 24:54.470
Great. As what?

24:54.510 --> 24:55.640
A stand-up act.

24:55.680 --> 24:58.260
A comedienne. Intriguing.

24:58.310 --> 25:00.850
-I told you that, didn't I?
-You did. But...

25:00.890 --> 25:02.390
I didn't know
if you were kidding.

25:02.430 --> 25:05.690
Because you're a comedienne.
(chuckles)

25:05.730 --> 25:08.650
Anyhow, I've helped
tons of comics

25:08.690 --> 25:11.320
shape acts over the years.

25:11.360 --> 25:14.740
And I've dabbled in TV a little.

25:14.780 --> 25:16.990
Wrote an episode
of Our Miss Brooks.

25:17.030 --> 25:18.950
-Do you know it?
-I love that show.

25:18.990 --> 25:20.740
Eve Arden's a dream.

25:20.790 --> 25:23.120
-Mm.
-A real dream.

25:23.160 --> 25:25.460
So please, talk.

25:25.500 --> 25:27.210
Well, I did a slot
a few nights ago

25:27.250 --> 25:29.540
talking about a new job I got,
as a makeup counter girl.

25:29.590 --> 25:31.130
I thought it was a natural,

25:31.170 --> 25:33.260
and I... bombed.

25:33.300 --> 25:34.630
Big-time.

25:34.680 --> 25:36.340
It was scary.

25:36.390 --> 25:38.550
I'm getting clammy
just thinking about it.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.470
It's also warm in here.

25:40.510 --> 25:42.470
This what I've
been drawing from...

25:42.520 --> 25:44.140
my comedy notebook.

25:44.180 --> 25:46.140
It's just some
random funny thoughts

25:46.190 --> 25:48.190
I've written down
over the years.

25:48.230 --> 25:50.110
I need someone like you
to make sense of it.

25:50.150 --> 25:52.320
Minnie Pearl has
a comedy notebook.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.900
Puts you in a good company.

25:53.940 --> 25:55.820
"I know you're

26:07.170 --> 26:08.710

26:08.750 --> 26:10.340

-Perfect.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.180

26:20.220 --> 26:21.600
Well, I'd love to help.

26:21.640 --> 26:23.720
And I can dive in today.

26:23.770 --> 26:27.390

five minutes of material.

26:28.650 --> 26:30.060
Sounds very good.

(laughs)

26:32.610 --> 26:33.780
Tell me more.

26:33.820 --> 26:35.570
I went to Bryn Mawr.

26:35.610 --> 26:38.490
Definitely the funniest
of the seven sisters.

26:40.950 --> 26:43.740
Then brush the color
onto the lid, just lightly,

26:43.790 --> 26:45.330
and stop right here,

26:45.370 --> 26:47.750
about half an inch
before you reach the eyebrow.

26:47.790 --> 26:49.750
I'll never be able
to recreate this tomorrow.

26:49.790 --> 26:51.420
No problem.
I'm coming home with you.

26:51.460 --> 26:53.130
-(giggles) -Saw this for you
in the break room.

26:53.170 --> 26:55.380
-Thanks, Harriet. Excuse me.
-Mm-hmm.

27:07.020 --> 27:08.850
Is that a pickle?

27:08.890 --> 27:10.650
I believe it is a pickle.

27:10.690 --> 27:13.320
Ladies, will you excuse me
just a quick moment?

27:13.360 --> 27:14.940
Absolutely.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.990

27:20.990 --> 27:22.410

27:22.450 --> 27:24.240
MIDGE:
Yes, hello. Is Herb Smith there?

27:24.280 --> 27:26.040
Herb? Phone.

27:26.080 --> 27:28.330
-HERB: Do they sound angry?
-I'm not your fuckin' secretary.

27:28.370 --> 27:29.830
Just come get it.

27:29.870 --> 27:32.130
-This is Herb.
-Herb, hi. Midge Maisel.

27:32.170 --> 27:34.340
And not the IRS? Thank God.

27:34.380 --> 27:36.000
-Good one.
-You get my package?

27:36.050 --> 27:37.420
Shipped it out this morning.

27:37.460 --> 27:39.340
I did get it.
And I'm a little confused.

27:39.380 --> 27:41.470
I don't know if you got
the five messages I left you,

27:41.510 --> 27:43.350
but I have a slot
at the Gaslight tonight.

27:43.390 --> 27:46.220
The Gaslight?
So you know Susie Myerson.

27:46.260 --> 27:47.680
-She's terrific.
-She is.

27:47.720 --> 27:49.350
But I don't have
a lot of time to prepare,

27:49.390 --> 27:50.890
and I'm just wondering
what the deal is

27:50.940 --> 27:53.020
-with the three-by-five cards.
-They're your act.

27:53.060 --> 27:55.440
But... I have no time
to memorize all this.

27:55.480 --> 27:57.150
So you take them up on stage.

27:57.190 --> 27:59.690
It's how all the greats
worked out their acts.

27:59.740 --> 28:03.490
Bob Hope, Moms Mabley...
everybody uses cards.

28:03.530 --> 28:05.280
Yeah, I've seen comics
use cards.

28:05.330 --> 28:08.660
It's fun for the audience to see
a comic working like this.

28:08.700 --> 28:12.080
It can be hit-and-miss at times,
but lots of fun.

28:12.120 --> 28:14.670
-I guess.
-Just have a stool next to you.

28:14.710 --> 28:17.340
You can put the cards
on the stool.

28:17.380 --> 28:19.210
The Gaslight has a stool,
doesn't it?

28:19.260 --> 28:20.670
They do have a stool.

28:20.720 --> 28:22.800
I should have put the stool
in the cards.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.800
The stool is a big thing.

28:24.850 --> 28:26.890
-You see the pickle?
-I did see the pickle.

28:26.930 --> 28:28.220
The pickle's funny.

28:28.270 --> 28:29.390
-The pickle is funny.
-So...

28:29.430 --> 28:30.680
break a leg.

28:30.730 --> 28:32.060
Uh, I will. Thank you, Herb.

28:32.100 --> 28:34.190
Can't wait to hear how it goes.

28:34.230 --> 28:35.190

Hey, Midge, one thought?

35:49.460 --> 35:50.830
Oh, he's got a thought.

35:50.870 --> 35:52.460
The husband joke.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.710
When you hit him over the head
with the frying pan,

35:54.750 --> 35:56.500
it's not "doink."

35:56.550 --> 35:59.340
It's...
"Doy-yoy-yoy-yoy-yoink!"

35:59.380 --> 36:02.430
Herb, the thing I'm gonna
hit you over the head with,

36:02.470 --> 36:06.850
your screams are gonna drown out
the doy-yoy-yoy-yoy-yoy-yoink!

36:06.890 --> 36:09.060
We got to talk.
Good-bye, Herb.

36:10.850 --> 36:12.020
SUSIE:
Herb Smith.

36:12.060 --> 36:13.810
-Really?
-I needed help.

36:13.860 --> 36:15.690
So you hire a guy
that'll work for salami?

36:15.730 --> 36:17.030
I didn't want to bomb again.

36:17.070 --> 36:18.360
-Oh, mission accomplished.
-Ha, ha.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.570
Geez. If I wanted
an act like that,

36:19.610 --> 36:21.200
I'd have booked your husband.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.570
-Real nice. -I thought
we were doing this together.

36:23.620 --> 36:26.030
-Are we not doing this together?
-I'm here, aren't I?

36:26.080 --> 36:27.950
You go behind my back,
you hire a guy to help you.

36:27.990 --> 36:29.700
I'm here to help you.

36:29.750 --> 36:32.670
How? By rushing me onstage
when I wasn't even ready?

36:32.710 --> 36:34.500
-What are you talking about?
-I hardly stepped in the door

36:34.540 --> 36:36.130
and you were pushing me
to go on.

36:36.170 --> 36:38.590
-I wanted you to have
a good audience. -Great job.

36:38.630 --> 36:39.800
-So it's my fault.
-Yes.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.340
-Hey, fuck you.
-No, fuck you.

36:41.380 --> 36:43.050
What is wrong with you?

36:43.090 --> 36:44.430
I can't do this anymore.

36:44.470 --> 36:45.640
-Don't.
-I can't do it.

36:45.680 --> 36:46.720
I-I don't want to do it.

36:46.760 --> 36:48.470
We've talked about bombing.

36:48.510 --> 36:50.600
So you get up on stage and bomb.
See how you like it.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.390
-I'd hate it.
-Well, there you go.

36:52.440 --> 36:54.310
But I'm not a comedian.
You're the comedian.

36:54.350 --> 36:55.940
-Not anymore.
-Bullshit.

36:55.980 --> 36:58.400
-Not anymore.
-Oh. Again?

36:58.440 --> 37:00.070
Okay, fine. So you're
not gonna do this?

37:00.110 --> 37:01.150
-Nope.
-You're giving up?

37:01.190 --> 37:02.240
Yeah.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.860
Fine.

37:03.910 --> 37:05.410
Go get your purse.

37:05.450 --> 37:06.990
Go on home.

37:07.030 --> 37:08.870
But this is good-bye, Miriam.

37:08.910 --> 37:11.700
Or Sadie, or Cuntsy Lou Who
or whatever your name is.

37:11.750 --> 37:13.250
Because that's all
you and I are.

37:13.290 --> 37:15.210
Professional relationship.
Not girlfriends.

37:15.250 --> 37:17.090
-I know that.
-And if there's no profession,

37:17.130 --> 37:19.500
there's no relationship,
capisce?

37:19.550 --> 37:20.920
Good-bye.

37:20.960 --> 37:22.380
Uh, don't forget
your comedy cards.

37:22.420 --> 37:24.010
You paid good money for them.

37:24.050 --> 37:25.550
Don't forget to cancel
that phone you ordered.

37:25.590 --> 37:27.180
Unless it's too late.

37:27.220 --> 37:29.470
Oh, don't worry.
I didn't order the stupid phone.

37:29.510 --> 37:31.680
Maybe I can instinctively
smell a loser!

37:31.720 --> 37:33.270
Fine!

37:35.020 --> 37:37.190
MOISHE: So the priest turns
to the nun and says,

37:37.230 --> 37:39.190
"Excuse me,
are you staring at me?"

37:39.230 --> 37:40.730
-Is this a dirty joke?
-Would I tell a dirty joke

37:40.780 --> 37:41.860
-in mixed company?
-Yes. -Yes.

37:41.900 --> 37:43.190
It's not a dirty joke.

37:43.240 --> 37:45.360
Eat that, honey.
Eat it so that I won't.

37:45.410 --> 37:46.780
-(laughs)
-So, the nun says to the priest,

37:46.820 --> 37:49.530
"I remember you.
We met once at the Vatican."

37:49.580 --> 37:51.620
-This is a dirty joke.
-Not a dirty joke.

37:51.660 --> 37:53.910
And so, the priest says,
"The Vatican's full

37:53.960 --> 37:56.500
"of a lot of priests, all in
robes who look just like me.

37:56.540 --> 37:58.170
How do you know that was me?"

37:58.210 --> 38:00.710
And the nun says...

38:00.750 --> 38:02.130
This is a dirty joke.

38:02.170 --> 38:03.880
-(laughs) -SHIRLEY: I knew it.
-So did I.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.930
All right. I'll resume
smelling my dessert wine

38:05.970 --> 38:08.510
and acting like I know
what the hell I'm talking about.

38:08.550 --> 38:10.300
Excuse me, everyone,
I'm going to go freshen up.

38:10.350 --> 38:12.020
-Because you're stale?
-(laughs)

38:12.060 --> 38:14.060
I'll come with you,
because I am definitely stale.

38:14.100 --> 38:16.100
-(laughs)
-You're gorgeous, too, Shirl.

38:16.140 --> 38:18.100
SHIRLEY: You're killing m
with that tiny tush.

38:18.150 --> 38:20.020
PENNY:
Oh, Mrs. Maisel...

38:22.480 --> 38:25.070
-No.
-What?

38:25.110 --> 38:27.280
-Her. No. -What the hell
are you talking about?

38:27.320 --> 38:28.610
You know what I'm talking about.

38:28.660 --> 38:29.910
How would I know
what you're talking about?

38:29.950 --> 38:31.120
She's young, she's emptyheaded,

38:31.160 --> 38:32.660
she doesn't eat. She's a shiksa.

38:32.700 --> 38:34.790
-So?
-Shiksas are for practice.

38:34.830 --> 38:36.080
Want to say that
a little louder?

38:36.120 --> 38:37.250
I think you heard me just fine.

38:37.290 --> 38:38.250
I don't believe this.

38:38.290 --> 38:39.330
Don't act like a child.

38:39.380 --> 38:40.330
You can't judge her like this.

38:40.380 --> 38:41.380
You don't even know her.

38:41.420 --> 38:42.590
I know enough. That is a girl

38:42.630 --> 38:44.010
that you have on the side, Joel.

38:44.050 --> 38:45.630
It's not a girl you marry.

38:45.670 --> 38:47.380
You don't introduce her
to your fucking parents.

38:47.430 --> 38:49.220
I had Yankees tickets tonight.

38:49.260 --> 38:51.140
She's a good girl. Sweet.

38:51.180 --> 38:52.600
"Sweet." Good.
Sounds like a Danish.

38:52.640 --> 38:53.600
-You'd hate her no matter what.
-Yeah. Convince yourself

38:53.640 --> 38:55.350
of that and then we'll talk.

38:55.390 --> 38:56.390
(footsteps approaching)

38:56.430 --> 38:58.350
No.

38:59.900 --> 39:01.900
I'm eating her dessert.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.020
MOISHE:
Oh, there she is.

39:03.070 --> 39:05.030
I stole... I stole your dessert.

39:05.070 --> 39:06.280
That's okay, Mrs. Maisel.

39:06.320 --> 39:07.700
Oh, call me Shirley.

39:07.740 --> 39:09.280
-Oh.
-MOISHE: I've got another joke.

39:09.320 --> 39:11.530
-It's gonna be dirty again.
-It's not gonna be dirty.

39:11.570 --> 39:13.790
So, a clown walks
into a laundromat.

39:13.830 --> 39:15.120
-SHIRLEY: This is dirty.
-(laughs)

39:15.160 --> 39:16.450
MOISHE:
There's nothing dirty about it.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.250
SHIRLEY:
He told this joke five years ago

39:18.290 --> 39:19.750
in front of the rabbi.

39:19.790 --> 39:21.460
MOISHE: Wait, is this
the dirty temple joke?

39:21.500 --> 39:22.880
SHIRLEY:
It's the dirty temple joke.

39:22.920 --> 39:24.420
MOISHE:
Are you sure?

39:24.460 --> 39:26.260
SHIRLEY: It ends with
cabbage up the chimney.

39:26.300 --> 39:28.380
MOISHE: You're right, it's too
dirty. Funny, but too dirty.

39:28.420 --> 39:30.220
-Okay. Knock, knock.
-SHIRLEY (laughing): Moishe...

I didn't say you were a drunk.
I said you were drunk.

Honey, you have two cups.
What's up with that?

43:00.760 --> 43:03.560

You will thank me
in the morning.

She's not gonna be thanking
anyone in the morning.

43:10.100 --> 43:11.270

Oh, me either.

43:25.200 --> 43:26.620
-But I like being tipsy.
-Mmm.

43:26.660 --> 43:28.250
I mean, I wish
there was a pill...

43:28.290 --> 43:31.330
I-I guess there is.
It's called "pills."

43:31.380 --> 43:34.210
Hi, girls. Uh, what happened
to all the guys?

43:34.250 --> 43:35.880
They're clustered in a corner.

43:35.920 --> 43:37.550
Why do they do that?

43:37.590 --> 43:38.970
Why do they cluster like that?

43:39.010 --> 43:40.970
Because we intimidate them
or because

43:41.010 --> 43:44.220
they're finally admitting they
don't know anything about cars?

43:44.260 --> 43:47.310
Lots of tears
and catharsis over that.

43:47.350 --> 43:50.100
Or maybe they're just hoping to
start a really easily-winnable

43:50.140 --> 43:53.310
game of tug-of-war.
Or it's just a bunch of guys

43:53.360 --> 43:55.360
who didn't make their high
school team talking about

43:55.400 --> 43:58.650
how Mickey Mantle
can improve his swing.

43:58.690 --> 44:00.740
(knocking at door)

44:10.210 --> 44:11.710
Hi, Rose.

44:11.750 --> 44:15.090
Did Midge tell you?
I'm bringing Ethan back.

44:18.510 --> 44:19.970
See you later, sport.

44:20.010 --> 44:22.010
Bye, Daddy.

44:27.180 --> 44:29.180
Your wife is working.

44:33.690 --> 44:35.230
Your first apartment?

44:35.270 --> 44:36.730
My very first.

44:36.770 --> 44:38.780
You know, I never had
a first apartment.

44:38.820 --> 44:42.110
I lived with my folks,
went to college, got married.

44:42.150 --> 44:44.160
I've never
killed my own spiders.

44:44.200 --> 44:45.870
What do you do
if you see one?

44:45.910 --> 44:48.830
I assume
just get a new apartment.

44:48.870 --> 44:51.580
Really, three girls
and one bathroom?

44:51.620 --> 44:53.670
And you haven't
tried to kill each other yet?

44:53.710 --> 44:55.670
Just... attack each other
with eyelash curlers,

44:55.710 --> 44:57.590
karate each other
with bra straps...
