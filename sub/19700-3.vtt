WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.371
(sewing machine whirring)

00:04.205 --> 00:06.740
(crunching)

00:12.012 --> 00:13.981
ANNOUNCER: FX presents

00:14.014 --> 00:16.016
Feud: Bette and Joan.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.522
(indistinct conversations,
bell rings)

00:24.525 --> 00:27.195
Ew.
How are you doing that?

00:27.228 --> 00:29.830
It's so easy.
I'll show you.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.232
Oh, we're not
allowed to smoke.

00:31.265 --> 00:32.566
You don't inhale.
That's the whole point.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.535
Boys love it.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.371
Here. You try.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.209
JOAN:
Kathy!

00:42.376 --> 00:44.745
What are you doing?

00:44.778 --> 00:46.547
Why don't you girls go back
to my dressing room, please.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.517
Thank you.

00:49.550 --> 00:53.221
I'll be speaking to your mother
about this, miss.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.863
I want you to stay away
from that girl.

01:02.896 --> 01:06.700
When you see her again,
no need to be rude.

01:06.734 --> 01:09.036
Just wish her a
crisp "good morning"

01:09.069 --> 01:12.039
and keep moving.
There.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.574
Oh, Mamacita,

01:13.607 --> 01:15.276
that's lovely.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.644
Mm-hmm.

01:20.614 --> 01:24.051
I believe I'll have the veal
tonight, Michael, please.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.053
And Mamacita,

01:26.086 --> 01:27.888
I noticed you were
eyeing the liver.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.557
Yeah, with onions.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.393
Mm-hmm.
And fish sticks for you girls?

01:32.426 --> 01:33.927
May we have steak?

01:33.961 --> 01:36.297
(laughing):
Oh.

01:36.330 --> 01:39.133
Oh, they grow up so fast.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.568
(chuckles)

01:40.601 --> 01:42.803
Two filets, Michael, please.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.805
Very rare.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.840
Thank you.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.479
Mother, may we
take off these bows?

01:51.512 --> 01:53.247
Everybody's staring.

01:53.281 --> 01:56.917
That's not why
they're staring, dear heart.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.520
Oh, Miss Joan,
before I forget...

02:00.954 --> 02:02.590
What's this?

02:02.623 --> 02:04.258
It's the card to
go with the flowers

02:04.292 --> 02:05.793
you're sending
to Miss Christina.

02:05.826 --> 02:08.296
She's opening in her
play tomorrow night.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.632
No.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.834
No, I don't believe I will.

02:13.867 --> 02:17.771
Do you think my mother
ever sent me flowers?

02:17.805 --> 02:19.840
Do you think
she ever sent me anything?

02:19.873 --> 02:22.310
I was earning my own
room and board by the time

02:22.343 --> 02:24.144
I was 12 years old,
scrubbing toilets.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.146
But did I complain?

02:26.180 --> 02:27.448
Not once.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.350
Did I expect cards and flowers?

02:29.383 --> 02:31.285
Never.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.854
But I'll tell you what,
it made me tough.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.357
Gave me ambition.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.992
No, we'll...

02:39.026 --> 02:41.995
we'll see how
her reviews are and then...

02:42.029 --> 02:44.232
we'll think about
sending flowers.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.175
You may go to the powder room

02:55.209 --> 02:56.644
and remove your bows,

02:56.677 --> 02:58.512
if that's
what you wish.

02:58.546 --> 03:01.148
But don't come back
looking disheveled.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.016
Thank you, Mommie.
Thank you, Mommie.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.329
Here, let me see that.

03:15.363 --> 03:18.031
Mamacita, let me see that.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.701
And a pen.

03:49.297 --> 03:52.065
*

05:13.013 --> 05:14.281
WOMAN:
These are the second

05:14.314 --> 05:16.283
and third choices
for the neighbor girl.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.952
Yeah, they're not a patch
on the girl I had to let go.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.288
How about her? She just
came off of Wagon Train.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.956
Yeah, looks like
she was pulling it.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.292
That is why
we're recasting, isn't it?

05:25.325 --> 05:26.627
The first one was too pretty?

05:26.660 --> 05:27.995
Who's too pretty?

05:28.028 --> 05:29.863
Tony Curtis.
Which is why

05:29.897 --> 05:32.466
I'm still refusing
his dinner invitations.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.467
I need to speak with Bob.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.636
He is all yours.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.571
Well, half yours.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.545
Uh...

05:44.578 --> 05:48.482
I think it's best
to be direct in these matters.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.317
What happened Friday night
was wonderful,

05:50.350 --> 05:52.553
but it can't happen again.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.488
Oh, Betty, you don't
know how happy I am

05:54.522 --> 05:56.657
to hear you say that.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.659
I was looking at Harriet
this morning, and I thought,

05:58.692 --> 06:01.529
"Oh, this... this can't
happen again." You're right.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.663
I agree with you
completely.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.331
Good.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.834
But did you
have to agree so quickly?

06:06.867 --> 06:08.335
(both laugh)

06:08.368 --> 06:10.337
What's all this?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.840
Oh, cannon fodder. Possible
replacements for the girl

06:12.873 --> 06:14.842
that you and Crawford
had me can.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.544
Here are the revised pages, Dad.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.845
Thank you, honey.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.681
Adell.
Such a professional young lady.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.416
How are you finding things?
Enjoying yourself?

06:22.450 --> 06:23.851
Oh, it's a real thrill.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.185
I feel like
I'm learning so much.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.020
You're doing a marvelous job.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.723
Oh, thank you, Miss Davis.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.892
(hammering)

06:31.925 --> 06:34.261
Bette! Don't coddle her.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.363
You promised me you'd
be as tough on her

06:36.396 --> 06:38.098
as you would any
other script girl.

06:38.131 --> 06:41.535
I just admire that you make
your pictures a family affair.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.203
It's called nepotism.
The town runs on it.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.772
That is so true.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.874
Perhaps we should cast my
daughter as the neighbor girl.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.876
(laughs)
That's not a bad idea.

06:48.909 --> 06:52.279
No, I'm joking, Bob.
No, come on!
B.D.'s the right age.

06:52.312 --> 06:53.714
She's got the right
amount of teenage sass.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.249
She is not an actress.
Well, look who

06:56.283 --> 06:57.751
her mother is, for Christ sake.

06:57.785 --> 07:00.287
The apple can't fall
that far from the tree.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.922
Now you say she
doesn't understand you,

07:01.955 --> 07:03.624
doesn't appreciate how
hard you work for her.

07:03.657 --> 07:04.892
Well, give her a
pair of your shoes,

07:04.925 --> 07:07.294
and let her walk
around for a while.

07:07.327 --> 07:08.962
And what would Crawford
think about that?

07:08.996 --> 07:10.898
She has a daughter who's
actually an actress, you know.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.567
Christina's too
old for the part.

07:13.601 --> 07:16.470
She's adopted.
She could be talented.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.806
(laughs)

07:18.839 --> 07:20.440
(knocking)

07:20.474 --> 07:22.910
Yeah.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.746
Bette, I'm sorry.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.581
I would have waited
to bring this up, but

07:27.615 --> 07:30.083
I just felt like I couldn't do
my best work today

07:30.117 --> 07:32.753
with it weighing on my mind.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.421
It's about B.D.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.923
Oh, Christ,
I planned to talk to you

07:35.956 --> 07:37.257
about this after we wrapped.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.959
Did she already
say something?

07:38.992 --> 07:41.762
I just want you to know,
I was not unkind,

07:41.795 --> 07:44.264
though I was quite firm.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.601
Well, what are you talking
about?

07:47.635 --> 07:51.004
Your daughter was corrupting
my twins.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.843
I caught them smoking.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.311
I already told her
to steer clear of your tots,

07:58.345 --> 08:01.314
and she knows
she is not supposed to smoke.

08:01.348 --> 08:06.353
Well, perhaps you can keep
a little tighter reign on her.

08:06.386 --> 08:08.488
Sure, but let me
ask you something.

08:08.522 --> 08:11.124
I see the way your girls
are. They're like two

08:11.158 --> 08:12.660
well-trained Pomeranians.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.962
Just what is your secret?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.196
My secret?

08:19.032 --> 08:21.635
Well, uh...

08:21.669 --> 08:26.306
I've always been
a strict disciplinarian.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.810
Some people perhaps find
that I've been too strict,

08:29.843 --> 08:31.478
especially with my first two--

08:31.511 --> 08:34.314
Christina and Christopher.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.817
I find
that giving children a task

08:36.850 --> 08:39.987
to perform occupies the mind,

08:40.020 --> 08:42.990
and-and gives them a real sense

08:43.023 --> 08:45.693
of accomplishment
and responsibility.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.995
I mean, my twins,
for instance--

08:48.028 --> 08:53.333
they just love...
sewing and cooking.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.235
That's a good idea.
So, Crawfish?

08:56.870 --> 09:01.341
What do you say we toss back
a few after work tonight?

09:01.374 --> 09:03.376
(laughs)

09:03.410 --> 09:05.345
You and me?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.546
I'll buy.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.852
All right.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.220
And close the door.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.088
What?
The door.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.557
Close it?
Yeah.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.397
BETTE:
So,

09:24.431 --> 09:27.267
I had just wanted to thank you.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.536
Thank me? For what?

09:29.569 --> 09:31.204
For your advice.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.740
I'm putting

09:32.773 --> 09:34.608
B.D. to work... on the picture.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.744
Bob wants her
to play the neighbor girl.

09:36.777 --> 09:39.412
Really?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.751
I see. (laughs)

09:43.784 --> 09:45.719
That's why you asked me here.

09:45.753 --> 09:48.088
Because you were afraid
I would make a stink.

09:49.623 --> 09:52.059
I know what you think of me,
Bette.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.961
I know what you've always
thought of me.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.929
I know what you think
of my mothering.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.565
Well, I just want to say
that if I appear

09:58.598 --> 10:02.235
to be overprotective
or worry too much

10:02.269 --> 10:04.071
about my children,
it's only because

10:04.104 --> 10:06.640
I had a mother who didn't care
whether I lived or died.

10:06.674 --> 10:09.276
Threw me out
like a pair of old shoes.

10:09.309 --> 10:12.913
(chuckles) Shipped me off
to convent school when I was 12.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.615
Maybe she was trying
to protect your virtue.
Oh, no.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.250
No, no, no.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.119
That ship had sailed.
She knew that.

10:19.152 --> 10:22.422
You lost your cherry
when you were 12?

10:22.455 --> 10:24.457
11.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.461
Christ!

10:28.495 --> 10:31.131
I didn't even get a tingle
till I was 25,

10:31.164 --> 10:32.933
and then I waited
another two years

10:32.966 --> 10:34.434
before I did the deed,

10:34.467 --> 10:37.270
and that was
on my goddamn honeymoon.

10:37.304 --> 10:40.774
Well, in the desert
that was my childhood,

10:40.808 --> 10:45.612
I was grateful for any kind
of genuine affection.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.614
To feel cherished.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.150
Who was the lucky Cub Scout?

10:52.185 --> 10:55.155
My mother's second husband,
Henry Cassin.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.691
He was a lovely man.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.793
Meant the world to me.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.129
Well, we called him
"Daddy Cassin,"

11:02.162 --> 11:04.531
but he wasn't really my daddy.

11:04.564 --> 11:08.468
We weren't blood relations,
so it wasn't incest.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.138
But he was kind and gentle,

11:11.171 --> 11:14.207
and he loved me.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.710
I led him into it.

11:18.678 --> 11:22.082
You were just a child.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.318
Your mother

11:25.352 --> 11:27.320
should have kicked him out.

11:27.354 --> 11:31.158
Well, perhaps, but I was
glad to get out of there.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.559
(laughs)

11:32.592 --> 11:34.161
Get away from my mother.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.563
I mean, the nuns
were brutal, but...

11:36.596 --> 11:39.199
nothing compared to the
way my mother treated me.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.836
The nuns actually taught me
a great deal,

11:42.870 --> 11:45.005
things I still cherish.

11:45.038 --> 11:49.777
Discipline, the importance
of cleanliness and order.

11:54.247 --> 11:57.517
Well, after my father
ditched us,

11:57.550 --> 12:01.054
we were also sent off
to a boarding school.

12:01.088 --> 12:03.924
Not nuns.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.692
Puritan Yankees.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.695
You know, lots of fresh air,
no electricity,

12:08.728 --> 12:11.899
naked baths in the snow.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.533
I loved it.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.702
Made me tough.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.205
'Course it was very difficult

12:18.238 --> 12:20.573
being separated from my mother,
but she had to work.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.575
I mean, and work she did,
like a dog,

12:22.609 --> 12:24.711
until we were reunited.

12:24.744 --> 12:28.381
And then she never left my side
to the end of her days.

12:28.415 --> 12:34.087
She, um...
she died only last year.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.057
Do you miss her?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.926
Yes.

12:39.927 --> 12:42.629
Yes.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.998
I think maybe sh...

12:47.134 --> 12:51.271
She was
my only true female friend.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.109
You're lucky.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.814
Look,

13:00.848 --> 13:02.649
we don't have to be

13:02.682 --> 13:04.251
best pals.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.086
Just allies.

13:06.119 --> 13:09.756
We both want the same thing:

13:09.789 --> 13:12.759
for this picture
to be a success.

13:12.792 --> 13:16.429
Well, I'm sure it will be,
thanks to you.

13:16.463 --> 13:20.267
You're a shoo-in
for Best Actress.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.669
I'm too old to even think
about awards.

13:22.702 --> 13:23.937
(chuckles)

13:23.971 --> 13:26.273
There, you see that?

13:26.306 --> 13:28.275
Even that

13:28.308 --> 13:31.311
was almost
convincing.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.448
I mean it, Lucille.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.784
I'm going to support
this picture

13:37.817 --> 13:42.155
even if it means
supporting you, too.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.462
JOAN:
That story you were set to run,

13:49.496 --> 13:50.697
I don't think you should.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.465
HEDDA:
Don't go soft on me now.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.967
We have a strategy.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.635
If you want
to steal the picture,

13:55.668 --> 13:56.970
we should stick to it.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.806
But she'll know it came from me.
How?

13:59.839 --> 14:01.975
Anyone on that set
could've complained

14:02.009 --> 14:04.044
about her offensive body odor.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.712
But nobody works
under those lights

14:05.745 --> 14:07.480
in such close contact as I do.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.681
She'll know.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.017
(chuckles)
Well, I'll be damned.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.318
Joan Crawford,

14:11.351 --> 14:14.387
Miss Crystal Allen herself,

14:14.421 --> 14:15.989
is actually losing her nerve.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.991
No, it's just that I think

14:18.025 --> 14:21.328
I am beginning to understand
her a little bit.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.331
I mean, she's a single mother
working in Hollywood.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.500
I don't think you can begin
to appreciate, Hedda,

14:27.534 --> 14:29.336
just how tough that can be.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.038
You know, Joan,
I could've gone out

14:31.071 --> 14:33.173
and bought myself
a passel of brats, too.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.407
But why bother?

14:34.441 --> 14:35.943
The town's already full of 'em.

14:37.577 --> 14:40.547
There's no need to be small.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.715
Remind me to tell you that
on Oscar night

14:42.749 --> 14:46.686
when she picks up the award
for Best Actress.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.288
(line clicks)

14:50.723 --> 14:52.525
BETTE:
You said he was from Broadway.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.526
He's not.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.727
I checked.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.696
All his stage work

14:56.729 --> 14:57.864
is from San Diego.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.199
Yeah, the Old Globe.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.934
He's a distinguished
Shakespearian actor.

15:00.968 --> 15:03.870
Oh, I'm sure his Falstaff
is the talk of Tijuana.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.239
Oh, Christ,
look at him.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.375
He's eating because he's
nervous. Look, let's just

15:08.408 --> 15:10.710
get through this rehearsal,
then see how you feel.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.213
Nobody's that nervous.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.781
*

15:14.814 --> 15:16.216
"Hi, Mom!"

15:16.249 --> 15:18.285
Uh, why are you reading it

15:18.318 --> 15:20.587
as if you're thrilled
to see me? You're watching

15:20.620 --> 15:22.422
a shitty Crawford picture
on television.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.923
You're distracted. Try it again.

15:25.492 --> 15:26.759
I always think it's
nice to break bread

15:26.793 --> 15:29.062
with strangers, don't you?

15:29.096 --> 15:31.264
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.600
Sorry.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.236
Bob, don't you think
it would be better if I just...

15:36.269 --> 15:37.570
took the entire plate
from her?

15:37.604 --> 15:39.106
(chuckles)
Knock yourself out.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.240
I ain't hungry.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.241
Ha! Oh.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.775
Oh, that reaction is priceless.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.911
I imagine that would be
Jane's reaction, too--

15:44.944 --> 15:47.814
taken aback
by Edwin's boorishness.

15:47.847 --> 15:51.151
She'd wonder, "Is this man
a sophisticated artist

15:51.184 --> 15:53.153
or a cheap pig?"

15:53.186 --> 15:54.921
I guess she'll find out.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.456
I guess she will.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.425
B.D.:
And then the television talks,

15:58.458 --> 16:03.130
"When your dog says woof,
feed him Iliad."

16:03.163 --> 16:05.932
Then I say to the TV,

16:05.965 --> 16:08.201
"Oh, shut up."

16:11.638 --> 16:13.606
Now you talk some more.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.442
ROBERT: Okay, Bette,
you'll hear the buzz,

16:15.475 --> 16:17.110
you go upstairs
to confront Blanche.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.012
Then, Victor, you're left here
on your own to explore.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.014
Okay?

16:21.048 --> 16:23.016
B.D. (woodenly):
"Well, how come

16:23.050 --> 16:24.851
"we never see her
around?

16:24.884 --> 16:27.520
"We've been living next door
to them for six months now

16:27.554 --> 16:30.457
"and the only one I ever see
is that fat sister

16:30.490 --> 16:31.791
slouching around."

16:31.824 --> 16:33.693
ROBERT:
Get ready. And...

16:33.726 --> 16:34.694
Buzz.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.863
Will you please
excuse me?

16:36.896 --> 16:38.165
Oh. Certainly.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.572
You like him.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.475
I like talent.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.543
B.D.: "You know, Julie says that
sister is kind of peculiar.

16:50.577 --> 16:53.380
Did you ever notice that?"

16:53.413 --> 16:56.216
"No, I never have."

16:57.517 --> 16:59.519
You're good.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.056
Oh.

17:03.090 --> 17:06.159
It's like Mommie
just gave me a new pony.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.695
I'm awful, aren't I?

17:12.865 --> 17:14.867
You'll get better.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.075
(knocking at door)

17:22.109 --> 17:23.743
Yeah.

17:25.612 --> 17:28.014
I just got off the phone
with Hopper.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.517
She wanted me to comment
on a story.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.186
What story?

17:33.220 --> 17:34.521
ROBERT:
Bette.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.722
Bette...

17:35.755 --> 17:37.056
Where's your wheelchair?

17:37.090 --> 17:39.859
It's on the set, of course. Why?

17:39.892 --> 17:42.028
Because you're gonna need it
after I break your goddamn legs.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.197
Where do you get off telling
Hopper that you're gonna be

17:44.231 --> 17:45.532
in the Best Actress category

17:45.565 --> 17:47.567
and I've decided
to be in Supporting?

17:47.600 --> 17:50.237
It was your idea.
What? Have you lost your mind?

17:50.270 --> 17:52.205
(chuckles) Well, now,
she'd had a bit to drink--

17:52.239 --> 17:54.741
that's true-- but
she seemed lucid

17:54.774 --> 17:56.243
and certainly sincere.

17:56.276 --> 17:59.246
You said you didn't care
about awards,

17:59.279 --> 18:01.080
that you wanted to support me.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.615
BETTE: And you
took that to mean

18:02.649 --> 18:04.117
that I would go into Supporting

18:04.151 --> 18:06.419
and hand you Lead Actress?

18:06.453 --> 18:08.555
Well, I thought
it was a collegial gesture.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.458
I mean, after all,
you have bookend Oscars.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.460
I've only got one.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.462
Well, you tell Hopper
to print this:

18:15.495 --> 18:17.764
I'm not sharing shit with you.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.732
And let me tell you
something else, I'm going to be

18:19.766 --> 18:21.568
the first person
to have three Oscars.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.570
Even though everyone knows
I already should have,

18:23.603 --> 18:25.572
because I got robbed in 1950.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.774
That's certainly ungracious,
yes,

18:27.807 --> 18:31.944
and dismissive of Miss Judy
Holliday's winsome performance.

18:31.978 --> 18:33.780
She won by default!

18:33.813 --> 18:35.582
That bitch Anne Baxter,

18:35.615 --> 18:37.950
she pushed her way into my
category and we split the vote.

18:37.984 --> 18:39.319
That's why she won.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.754
Well, need I remind you that,

18:41.788 --> 18:43.490
unlike Eve, you and I

18:43.523 --> 18:45.992
share equal billing on this.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.827
We're both leads.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.263
Ladies, why are we fighting
about the Oscars?

18:50.297 --> 18:51.764
We haven't even finished
making this movie yet.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.833
Can we please concentrate
on the matter at hand?

18:53.866 --> 18:55.268
There's room for both
of you to succeed.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.969
(chuckles)
In this town?

18:57.003 --> 18:58.338
Are you nuts?

18:58.371 --> 18:59.339
Fuck off, Bob.

18:59.372 --> 19:00.840
And it was
Gloria Swanson

19:00.873 --> 19:02.942
who was robbed
in 1950,

19:02.975 --> 19:05.645
not you, bitch!

19:09.816 --> 19:13.186
Well, boss,
it looks like...

19:13.220 --> 19:16.223
you got yourself
another war picture after all.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.134
Good morning, Frank.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.837
I trust you had
a restful weekend. (chuckles)

19:30.870 --> 19:33.139
Oh, Mamacita,

19:33.172 --> 19:36.809
don't you just love a Monday?

19:36.843 --> 19:38.811
(chuckles)
Good morning.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.214
(clinking)

19:44.884 --> 19:47.487
This is gonna be
a long goddamn week.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.988
(bell rings)

19:49.021 --> 19:51.391
ROBERT: Okay, Bette,
I need the same energy.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.059
You come bursting
through the door

19:53.092 --> 19:54.994
and then you rush
over to Blanche.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.363
Okay?

19:56.396 --> 19:58.030
You rush over to the bed,

19:58.064 --> 19:59.866
you untie her,

19:59.899 --> 20:01.534
lift her off the bed,

20:01.568 --> 20:03.069
drag her to the door.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.405
Joan, Blanche is passed out.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.206
Okay? So you
just-just lie slack.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.508
You're dead weight.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.709
I'll say she is.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.178
Okay.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.513
Here we go.
(bell rings)

20:13.546 --> 20:16.182
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
Roll camera!

20:16.215 --> 20:17.617
SOUND MAN:
Speed!

20:19.719 --> 20:21.554
And action!

20:21.588 --> 20:24.357
(panting)

20:24.391 --> 20:27.360
Blanche. Blanche.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.195
You-you...

20:29.228 --> 20:30.563
you got to...

20:30.597 --> 20:33.232
got to... help me.

20:33.266 --> 20:36.403
Here, we've got to leave.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.371
Leave. Please.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.573
Please, Blanche.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.775
Blanche!

20:42.809 --> 20:44.043
Please!

20:44.076 --> 20:46.112
(grunting)

20:46.145 --> 20:48.114
(giggling)
ROBERT: Cut!

20:48.147 --> 20:50.450
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
Cut!

20:50.483 --> 20:51.784
(bell rings)
Okay, let's do it again.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.219
JOAN:
Oh, I'm so sorry.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.721
I'm ticklish.

20:54.754 --> 20:55.788
It's okay, Joan. It's okay.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.390
We'll do it again.
No problem.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.891
Are you ready?

20:58.925 --> 20:59.959
Okay, keep it together.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.260
Back to one.
(bell rings)

21:01.294 --> 21:02.261
Roll camera!

21:02.295 --> 21:03.630
SOUND MAN:
Speed!

21:03.663 --> 21:05.298
And... action!

21:05.332 --> 21:07.133
(grunting)
* Mama said there'll be days *

21:07.166 --> 21:09.068
* Like this,
there'll be days like this *
(coughing)

21:09.101 --> 21:11.070
ROBERT: Cut!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.472
* Mama said, Mama said *

21:12.505 --> 21:14.941
Must be the dust.
Back to one.

21:14.974 --> 21:18.077
* There'll be days like this,
my mama said *

21:18.110 --> 21:19.278
* Mama said, Mama said *
(slurping)

21:19.312 --> 21:21.914
* I went walking the other day *

21:21.948 --> 21:24.917
* And everything
was going fine *
* Ooh *

21:24.951 --> 21:26.453
Cut.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.254
Cut. What?
I'm sorry.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.922
Does she have to stand there?

21:29.956 --> 21:32.992
She's not the director.
Why is she standing there?

21:33.025 --> 21:34.994
If I were the director,
I'd tell you to do it again

21:35.027 --> 21:36.663
and again until
it was convincing.

21:36.696 --> 21:38.498
Bette, please.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.433
SOUND MAN: Speed!
ROBERT: Okay, you ready, Bette?

21:40.467 --> 21:42.635
Yeah.
And action.

21:42.669 --> 21:46.105
* There'll be days like this,
my mama said *

21:46.138 --> 21:48.775
JOAN:
Oh, that face.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.777
Right into camera.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.845
(chuckles)
This really is a horror picture.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.447
Cut!
(bell rings)

21:54.481 --> 21:55.615
ROBERT:
All right, let's do it again.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.784
Maybe we'll actually get it
right this time.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.452
I really think
this will be the one.

21:59.486 --> 22:00.953
That's encouraging,

22:00.987 --> 22:03.022
since you don't actually have
to do anything.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.524
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Roll camera!
SOUND MAN: Speed!

22:04.557 --> 22:05.525
Action.

22:05.558 --> 22:06.793
(grunting)

22:06.826 --> 22:08.027
(groans)
(laughing)

22:08.060 --> 22:10.029
Oh, what the fuck? Cut!

22:10.062 --> 22:11.864
And I know what
you're trying to do.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.866
I'm not trying to do anything.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.334
Honestly, Jane.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.838
(grunting)

22:18.871 --> 22:20.973
* Look at me *

22:21.007 --> 22:23.142
* Like I'm looking at you
one day *

22:23.175 --> 22:24.143
And cut.
(bell rings)

22:24.176 --> 22:25.144
(grunting)

22:25.177 --> 22:26.145
Bette.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.146
Cut!

22:27.179 --> 22:28.981
All right,
moving on.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.650
Joan, we're gonna need you
in here for the medium shots.

22:30.683 --> 22:33.152
* Mama said there'll be days
like this *

22:33.185 --> 22:35.888
* There'll be days like this,
Mama said *
(Bette grunting, Joan groaning)

22:35.922 --> 22:38.525
* Mama said, mama said *

22:38.558 --> 22:40.827
* I went walking the other day *

22:40.860 --> 22:42.495
* And everything
was going fine *

22:42.529 --> 22:43.696
Ow!

22:44.764 --> 22:46.566
Oh! Goddamn it!

22:46.599 --> 22:47.867
ROBERT: Cut, cut, cut, cut.
Oh, Christ!

22:47.900 --> 22:48.868
Are you okay?

22:48.901 --> 22:50.403
She did that on purpose!

22:50.437 --> 22:51.838
I barely touched her.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.372
JOAN:
Oh, Jesus. Well, are you

22:53.406 --> 22:55.875
just gonna stand
there, you bastard?!

22:55.908 --> 22:58.210
Did you get it?
* Mama said, Mama said *

22:58.244 --> 23:00.847
(grunting)
* Mama said there'll be days
like this *

23:00.880 --> 23:04.350
* There'll be days like this,
my mama said *

23:04.383 --> 23:06.018
Help me.

23:06.052 --> 23:09.055
Leave.
(grunting)

23:09.088 --> 23:11.257
ROBERT:
And cut!
(groans)

23:11.290 --> 23:13.426
BETTE: Son of a bitch!
(bell rings)

23:13.460 --> 23:15.595
Get me an osteopath,
for God's sakes.

23:15.628 --> 23:16.863
What's wrong? What's wrong?

23:16.896 --> 23:18.698
(Bette groans)
Jesus. Oh, my God!

23:18.731 --> 23:21.033
Don't touch me.
JOAN: Can we do it again?

23:21.067 --> 23:24.036
BETTE: Oh, are you kidding me?
Don't even think about it.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.137
(clank)

23:26.405 --> 23:30.276
I mean, it must be awful.

23:30.309 --> 23:33.713
You know, Julie says that
sister is kind of peculiar.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.382
Christ, this is painful.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.751
Oh, come on, Bette,
it's not that bad.

23:38.785 --> 23:41.454
Don't condescend,
Bob. She's awful.

23:41.488 --> 23:42.889
ROBERT: ...like a
regular sentence, you know?

23:42.922 --> 23:44.891
L-Like just a regular
person talking.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.893
Like... here?

23:46.926 --> 23:49.896
Try just a little
less. Just a-a...

23:49.929 --> 23:51.263
Start again,
start again.

23:51.297 --> 23:53.232
Okay. From the top or...

23:53.265 --> 23:55.968
BETTE: Maybe you could put
her dialogue off camera.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.804
ROBERT: You're overreacting.
It's a small part.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.906
She'll be fine.
I guess she should know.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.107
She's beautiful.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.742
She's not an actress.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.443
No, she's not.

24:04.477 --> 24:07.079
ROBERT:
Try as if you were talking...

24:07.113 --> 24:09.148
to your best friend.

24:09.181 --> 24:11.918
She should be billed
as B.D. Merrill, not Davis.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.286
...awful.
Julie says that sister is...

24:14.320 --> 24:15.321
ROBERT:
A little louder.

24:15.354 --> 24:16.589
What? That's her name.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.491
He adopted her.
Legally.

24:18.525 --> 24:21.761
You know, Julie says that
sister is kind of peculiar.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.430
Did you ever notice that?
Oh, God.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.465
What should I say to her?

24:26.499 --> 24:27.934
Well, she's your kid.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.002
You're not gonna tell her
she stinks on ice.

24:30.036 --> 24:31.838
You'll...
You'll lie to her.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.773
B.D.:
Don't they ever have company?

24:33.806 --> 24:36.609
I mean, it must be awful.

24:36.643 --> 24:38.945
BETTE:
Well, I think you're good.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.179
Really good.

24:40.212 --> 24:41.948
You don't know
what that means to me,

24:41.981 --> 24:43.115
coming from you.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.517
Sure, I do.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.686
All the queens love me.
(sighs)

24:46.719 --> 24:49.155
It's true.

24:49.188 --> 24:50.456
Do it again.

24:50.489 --> 24:53.159
Fine.
Mmm.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.463
"What a dump!"
(gasps delightedly)

24:57.496 --> 24:59.498
(chuckles)
Oh, it's marvelous.

24:59.532 --> 25:00.967
(sighs)

25:01.000 --> 25:03.035
You know,
I think it's so admirable

25:03.069 --> 25:04.837
the way you've embraced
my tribe.

25:04.871 --> 25:08.374
The truth is,
I only really knew I'd made it

25:08.407 --> 25:11.143
once the female impersonators
started doing me in their acts.

25:11.177 --> 25:14.313
Well, that guarantees you're
leaving behind a real legacy.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.750
Ah, the only...
real legacy is children.

25:20.553 --> 25:22.655
Not all destined
to become parents,

25:22.689 --> 25:26.192
but we are all
somebody's child.

25:26.225 --> 25:28.260
And your mother.
She loves you? Supports you?

25:30.897 --> 25:33.700
Mother's always
been just...

25:33.733 --> 25:35.902
very supportive.

25:35.935 --> 25:38.337
Good.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.239
We have to love our kids

25:40.272 --> 25:42.208
no matter what.

25:42.241 --> 25:43.509
Like my Margot.

25:43.542 --> 25:46.913
Oh. Who's Margot?

25:46.946 --> 25:48.014
My youngest.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.849
We adopted her
when she was just a baby.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.718
Sweet little thing.

25:51.751 --> 25:53.219
By the time she was three,

25:53.252 --> 25:56.355
it was clear
she wasn't like other children.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.858
She was diagnosed
mentally retarded.

25:58.891 --> 26:02.695
Oh. I'm so sorry.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.196
She's in a special school
in Maine.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.898
She gets everything she needs.

26:05.932 --> 26:08.434
And it ain't cheap,
let me tell you that.

26:08.467 --> 26:10.536
It's one of the main reasons
I'm doing this picture,

26:10.569 --> 26:11.771
is to pay her tuition.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.740
B.D.:
Mother.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.274
I'd like to run lines.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.376
I'm already doing that
with Mr. Buono, sweetheart.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.612
But I have a scene
that shoots tomorrow.

26:19.646 --> 26:22.815
Oh, well, then, you should be
in bed getting your beauty rest.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.054
I want to do a good job.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.456
I'm sure you'll do your best,
B.D.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.760
Good night.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.970
So, page 75.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.271
Oh, yes.

26:54.446 --> 26:58.317
Girls? Mommie's home.

27:00.787 --> 27:04.691
Girls?

27:09.128 --> 27:11.497
Girls!

27:18.470 --> 27:20.606
They're not here.
Don't you remember?

27:20.639 --> 27:22.675
They start camp
today. Two weeks.

27:22.709 --> 27:24.143
Of course.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.846
I guess I'm going to have
to get used to it.

27:26.879 --> 27:28.114
To camp?

27:28.147 --> 27:31.317
No. To this.

27:31.350 --> 27:34.520
Coming home
to this awful silence.

27:34.553 --> 27:37.289
You deserve silence.

27:37.323 --> 27:40.126
Children are hard work.

27:40.159 --> 27:43.362
Once the work is done,
silence is the reward.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.031
Reward?

27:45.064 --> 27:48.835
(chuckles) You know, Mamacita,
one of the things I loved most

27:48.868 --> 27:51.337
about having these children--

27:51.370 --> 27:53.139
all of them--

27:53.172 --> 27:56.642
was that no matter
what I was doing,

27:56.675 --> 27:58.644
making a picture,

27:58.677 --> 28:00.847
or out for an event,

28:00.880 --> 28:04.650
the mad rush
that was once my life...

28:04.683 --> 28:07.820
was that I'd always come home

28:07.854 --> 28:12.658
to this wonderful noise and joy.

28:12.691 --> 28:17.229
(chuckles, sniffles)

28:17.263 --> 28:19.999
Well, it's the condition
of being a professional woman,

28:20.032 --> 28:21.667
I suppose.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.736
Maybe all women.

28:23.770 --> 28:26.705
One day, you...

28:26.739 --> 28:29.842
you wake up and you find...

28:29.876 --> 28:32.745
(sobs quietly)

28:32.779 --> 28:35.948
You've no husband.

28:36.949 --> 28:39.718
Your career is over.

28:39.752 --> 28:41.187
The children are grown

28:41.220 --> 28:44.423
and left the nest.

28:44.456 --> 28:48.761
And all you're left with
is yourself.

28:48.795 --> 28:51.864
Yes. Women
outlive men.

28:51.898 --> 28:53.866
Children leave.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.534
Best get used to it.

28:55.567 --> 28:58.104
(chuckles)

28:58.137 --> 28:59.939
Oh, Mamacita.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.041
(laughs)

29:02.074 --> 29:06.045
How I love
your Teutonic pragmatism.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.446
No, you're right.

29:07.479 --> 29:09.215
It's no tragedy.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.884
It's simply a new chapter,
that's all.

29:11.918 --> 29:15.221
And me being alone
doesn't have to mean

29:15.254 --> 29:17.723
being lonely.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.092
Does it?

29:22.628 --> 29:24.063
(chuckles)

29:24.096 --> 29:27.967
I'll embrace the change
of things to come

29:28.000 --> 29:31.938
and really learn
how to enjoy me.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.473
Okay.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.943
Good night.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.286
(sniffles)

30:03.502 --> 30:06.105
(gunshots)

30:06.138 --> 30:08.607
(gunshots on TV continue)

30:08.640 --> 30:10.476
Don't shoot! We give up!

30:10.509 --> 30:12.311
How about you, Nevada?

30:12.344 --> 30:13.679
More sandwich?

30:13.712 --> 30:15.181
You'll have to come and get me.

30:15.214 --> 30:16.282
(sighs)

30:16.315 --> 30:17.449
Drop your gun.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.185
Thank you, Mamacita.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.387
(gunshots on TV)

30:36.568 --> 30:37.836
(inhales)

30:37.870 --> 30:39.138
I want the dirt.

30:39.171 --> 30:42.341
You'll have to settle for sand.

30:45.912 --> 30:48.647
Oh, you think she's hard
to take on a soundstage?

30:48.680 --> 30:50.816
My God, you should see her
in the wild.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.484
(Hedda laughs)

30:52.518 --> 30:54.320
JOAN: In broad daylight?
It's horrifying.

30:54.353 --> 30:55.988
BETTE:
Coca-Cola, Bob?

30:56.022 --> 30:57.223
You're a bad girl, Bette.

30:57.256 --> 30:59.358
(chuckles) So, where's
the Queen of Sheba?

30:59.391 --> 31:00.526
In her dressing room.

31:00.559 --> 31:01.693
She's coming.

31:01.727 --> 31:02.895
JOAN:
All those years

31:02.929 --> 31:04.696
of alcohol abuse

31:04.730 --> 31:06.398
have exacted a terrible price.

31:10.937 --> 31:12.338
BETTE:
Christ.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.573
It's a hundred degrees,
and she's drunk.

31:14.606 --> 31:16.542
JOAN:
And so unprofessional.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.177
She refused
a mobile dressing room.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.246
Insisted on being ferried

31:20.279 --> 31:21.914
back and forth to a motel,

31:21.948 --> 31:25.184
while the rest of us
sat and waited for her

31:25.217 --> 31:27.086
in the scorching sun.

31:27.119 --> 31:29.021
That's scandalous.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.389
(exhales)
It's warm, Mamacita.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.858
I'm going to need my
water standing by.

31:32.891 --> 31:33.926
Which water?

31:33.960 --> 31:35.694
ROBERT:
Joan.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.863
JOAN:
Bob.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.065
Joan.

31:39.098 --> 31:42.368
Good morning.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.203
Let me show you
where you're going to be dying.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.038
(chuckles)
I'm going to have to go back

31:46.072 --> 31:47.606
to my dressing room
for a moment,

31:47.639 --> 31:48.941
but I'll be right back.

31:48.975 --> 31:50.209
Your dressing room's
a hundred yards away.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.277
Let's rehearse the scene first.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.778
Mamacita, get the driver.

31:52.811 --> 31:55.114
(car door closes)

31:55.147 --> 31:57.583
I'll be right back.

32:00.987 --> 32:03.622
Lucky she's laying
on her back all day.

32:03.655 --> 32:06.425
JOAN: For her, it was
just another day at the beach.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.727
But for me, I really had to draw

32:08.760 --> 32:10.963
on some very deep feelings.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.468
It took all the skill
that I had

32:16.502 --> 32:20.239
just to bring some reality
to the moment.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.408
Because you're a pro.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.810
I'm not falling on those.

32:24.843 --> 32:26.645
I don't do stunts.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.080
JOAN:
And I got

32:28.114 --> 32:29.748
absolutely no support

32:29.781 --> 32:31.583
from my director

32:31.617 --> 32:33.752
or from my co-star.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.187
The selfish bitch.

32:37.123 --> 32:39.325
And cut.

32:39.358 --> 32:41.327
(Robert chuckles)
Print that one, Ernie.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.995
Let's go in tighter.

32:43.029 --> 32:45.097
Aah.
No, Joan.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.632
Joan.

32:46.665 --> 32:47.766
(sighs)
What?

32:47.799 --> 32:49.001
Wai-Wait, don't go anywhere.

32:49.035 --> 32:50.336
We're just swinging a lens.

32:50.369 --> 32:51.970
I'll be back in two ticks.

32:52.004 --> 32:53.272
We're losing the light.

32:53.305 --> 32:54.506
JOAN:
Tighter.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.943
Are you sure
that's not too tight?

32:57.976 --> 32:59.478
Well, get it even.

32:59.511 --> 33:00.779
All right.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.614
Is that as tight as it'll go?

33:02.648 --> 33:03.782
(scoffs)
Already it's too much.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.017
Oh, shut up.

33:05.051 --> 33:07.186
Just go ahead and tie
it, for Christ's sake.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.821
(car door closes)

33:14.160 --> 33:16.128
ROBERT: Is it me, or
is she getting younger?

33:16.162 --> 33:17.829
PAULINE:
You're just now noticing?

33:17.863 --> 33:19.498
Every time she comes
back from her trailer,

33:19.531 --> 33:20.966
she she's lost
five more years.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.000
Oh, Christ.

33:22.034 --> 33:23.969
Let's just get through this.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.805
JOAN:
It was my big scene.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.974
My dying confession.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.677
I knew she would do
something to steal it.

33:31.710 --> 33:34.480
Roll those big bug eyes
or something.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.348
Anything to draw the focus
to her.

33:36.382 --> 33:37.349
Action.

33:37.383 --> 33:40.352
Jane, I'm...

33:40.386 --> 33:43.489
I'm dying.

33:43.522 --> 33:46.058
There's no time.

33:46.092 --> 33:47.526
You must listen.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.895
I made you...

33:50.929 --> 33:54.032
...waste your whole life.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.037
She looks too goddamn good.

33:59.071 --> 34:02.108
So what did the old harpy do
to cock it up?

34:04.443 --> 34:06.512
Nothing.

34:06.545 --> 34:07.879
Nothing at all.

34:07.913 --> 34:11.217
I got through my
entire speech.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.085
I think I even moved her

34:13.119 --> 34:14.686
with my performance.

34:14.720 --> 34:18.757
Well, I'm already
writing the rave in my head.

34:18.790 --> 34:21.026
ROBERT: Jesus, Ernie.
How's she doing that?

34:21.059 --> 34:22.894
She looks 20 years younger.

34:22.928 --> 34:25.364
I was losing the light.
I think it must be

34:25.397 --> 34:27.065
those reflectors
I'm hitting her with.

34:27.099 --> 34:30.236
ROBERT:
No. I swear to God.

34:30.269 --> 34:34.072
It's the goddamn acting.

34:48.587 --> 34:52.758
JOAN:
I hate this fucking picture.

34:55.794 --> 34:58.063
But if it's successful,

34:58.096 --> 35:00.966
I can make a pretty penny.

35:03.669 --> 35:05.271
Okay.

35:05.304 --> 35:07.406
Okay.

35:07.439 --> 35:09.608
That's good.

35:18.284 --> 35:20.619
(sighs)

35:20.652 --> 35:22.954
I was in the neighborhood.

35:22.988 --> 35:25.757
How nice.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.793
Thank you.

35:27.826 --> 35:30.796
HEDDA:
So, word on the street

35:30.829 --> 35:32.831
is that Crawford's
walking away with the picture.

35:32.864 --> 35:35.601
Is that what all the
streetwalkers are saying, Hedda?

35:35.634 --> 35:37.603
That's the buzz.
Oh.

35:37.636 --> 35:38.937
And who's the busy little bee?

35:38.970 --> 35:40.105
Careful.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.107
Once you sting, you die.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.310
(laughs)
But not the queen.

35:44.343 --> 35:45.444
(chuckles)

35:45.477 --> 35:47.679
Oh, come on, Bette.

35:47.713 --> 35:50.015
All those ridiculous
studio press releases

35:50.048 --> 35:51.450
touting how wonderfully well

35:51.483 --> 35:52.651
you two have been getting along?

35:52.684 --> 35:53.952
It's hogwash.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.855
I happen to know
every single nasty thing

35:56.888 --> 35:59.625
you've done to Crawford
over the last six weeks.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.627
Kicking a woman in the head?

36:01.660 --> 36:03.295
(chuckles)

36:03.329 --> 36:06.632
Academy members don't reward
that sort of behavior.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.133
I mean,

36:08.166 --> 36:11.637
regardless of what we think
of Crawford,

36:11.670 --> 36:13.639
she is an institution.

36:13.672 --> 36:16.708
Or belongs in one if she
really thinks you're her friend.

36:17.243 --> 36:19.211
Oh, Bette.

36:21.347 --> 36:22.548
I'm offering you

36:22.581 --> 36:24.383
an opportunity.

36:24.416 --> 36:25.851
Give me your side of the story,

36:25.884 --> 36:27.886
and then when it all comes out,

36:27.919 --> 36:30.356
you won't have to be painted
as the bad guy.

36:30.389 --> 36:32.324
I win awards playing bad guys.

36:32.358 --> 36:33.559
But that's on the screen.

36:33.592 --> 36:34.993
This is real life.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.362
Real life? Ha!

36:36.395 --> 36:37.996
This isn't real life.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.398
This is Hollywood, Hedda.

36:39.431 --> 36:40.699
It's all fake,

36:40.732 --> 36:42.901
from the manicured lawns
in the desert

36:42.934 --> 36:45.704
to your manufactured concern.

36:46.705 --> 36:49.508
Well, I am concerned.

36:49.541 --> 36:52.378
I so wanted to write a story

36:52.411 --> 36:55.247
about how two of Hollywood's
golden titans

36:55.281 --> 36:56.415
were getting along.

36:56.448 --> 36:59.351
As an example
to ladies everywhere.

36:59.385 --> 37:00.586
But I am a truth teller.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.754
I must report the facts,

37:02.788 --> 37:06.425
regardless of how ugly
they may be.

37:06.458 --> 37:10.696
You have been circling
this project like a vulture

37:10.729 --> 37:12.063
from the start.

37:12.097 --> 37:13.532
It's women like you,

37:13.565 --> 37:15.701
who've nurtured venom and
resentment for years,

37:15.734 --> 37:18.036
that make it
such a battle for the rest of us

37:18.069 --> 37:19.905
who are actually putting
our asses on the line

37:19.938 --> 37:22.207
and risking something.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.775
Truth teller.

37:23.809 --> 37:27.579
That's right.

37:27.613 --> 37:29.715
And the truth is,

37:29.748 --> 37:32.083
I hear your daughter
stinks on ice.

37:32.117 --> 37:34.219
She practically ruins
the picture.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.387
Get out.

37:35.421 --> 37:36.722
And B.D.'s name

37:36.755 --> 37:37.789
better not show up

37:37.823 --> 37:39.558
in one of your
poison-pen columns.

37:39.591 --> 37:42.728
Everything's fair game, Bette.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.396
Not my child.

37:44.430 --> 37:46.965
And for your information,
she doesn't ruin the picture.

37:46.998 --> 37:49.100
Her role isn't important enough
to do that.

37:49.134 --> 37:50.135
(footsteps approaching)

37:56.675 --> 37:58.777
Shit.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.119
(indistinct chatter)

38:31.810 --> 38:32.944
I know you.

38:32.978 --> 38:34.613
Oh.

38:34.646 --> 38:37.616
I seen you on Hawaiian Eye.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.518
You're Charles Laughton.

39:00.338 --> 39:03.975
(moaning)

39:04.009 --> 39:07.479
ROUGHIAN:
I want to be in pictures.

39:07.513 --> 39:09.681
That's why I came out here
from Nebraska.

39:09.715 --> 39:12.317
You think I could be
in pictures?

39:12.350 --> 39:15.020
You think I could be a star?

39:16.522 --> 39:18.223
You have...

39:18.256 --> 39:21.159
loads of potential.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.694
(whistle blows)

39:23.529 --> 39:24.830
(excited chatter)

39:24.863 --> 39:27.065
Hey...

39:27.098 --> 39:28.066
(whistle blows)

39:28.099 --> 39:30.001
(indistinct chatter)

39:30.035 --> 39:31.503
Let's go. Come on.
There's been a mistake.

39:31.537 --> 39:34.339
This is...
I was looking for a gas station.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.374
(phone rings)

39:39.578 --> 39:41.913
What?

39:43.248 --> 39:44.215
(keys jangling)

39:44.249 --> 39:45.517
(door unlocks)

39:45.551 --> 39:46.518
DESK SERGEANT:
Well, them's the breaks, lady.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.019
Can bail your friend out

39:48.053 --> 39:49.721
after the judge sees him
in a few hours.

39:49.755 --> 39:52.057
BETTE: He's not seeing a judge
in a few hours

39:52.090 --> 39:54.359
because he did not do anything.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.361
My friend is an actor,

39:56.394 --> 39:57.563
and he was there doing research

39:57.596 --> 40:00.231
for a part in a motion picture.

40:00.265 --> 40:03.735
I suppose you could verify that?

40:03.769 --> 40:06.371
What do you think?

40:06.404 --> 40:09.374
Uh...

40:09.407 --> 40:12.410
Can't thank you enough
for doing this.

40:12.444 --> 40:15.581
You'll understand why I couldn't
call my own mother.

40:15.614 --> 40:17.549
I spent 30 years earning
a little capital.

40:17.583 --> 40:19.384
I don't mind spending
it on a friend.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.286
But Victor, you've got
to be more careful.

40:21.319 --> 40:22.454
Something like this

40:22.488 --> 40:23.555
could ruin your career.

40:23.589 --> 40:25.256
I hate keeping secrets.

40:25.290 --> 40:28.259
I hate lying.

40:28.293 --> 40:30.762
Lying is what we do
for a living, kid.

40:33.131 --> 40:35.266
(soundtrack fades)

40:42.774 --> 40:44.776
(projector stops)

40:46.778 --> 40:48.747
Jack, I know it's a little
rough around the edges,

40:48.780 --> 40:51.316
but this short editing
schedule you've got me on

40:51.349 --> 40:52.751
is pretty brutal.

40:52.784 --> 40:53.919
(chuckles)

40:53.952 --> 40:55.754
I'll tell you
what's brutal.

40:55.787 --> 40:58.790
I got 400 theaters
booked already.

40:58.824 --> 41:00.926
Four hundred.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.928
And this is what
you give me?

41:02.961 --> 41:04.496
Come on.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.431
Look, Bob,

41:06.464 --> 41:08.834
the picture's not terrible,
until the end.

41:08.867 --> 41:11.469
And that's the only thing
that anybody's gonna remember.

41:11.503 --> 41:13.138
If you don't have an ending
that works,

41:13.171 --> 41:14.940
you don't have a picture, right?

41:14.973 --> 41:16.942
You want to change
the ending.

41:16.975 --> 41:19.444
No, I don't want to...
I... God damn it!

41:19.477 --> 41:22.814
I want the ending
that we agreed on.

41:22.848 --> 41:25.617
Crawford dying
on the beach.

41:25.651 --> 41:26.952
That's what I want.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.954
Instead, every time
you cut back to her,

41:28.987 --> 41:31.623
it looks like she's
getting better.

41:31.657 --> 41:34.192
It's like fucking
Camille in reverse.

41:34.225 --> 41:37.295
Yeah, yeah, what... okay,
we-we can reshoot that.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.864
You're goddamn
right we can.

41:38.897 --> 41:40.465
Yeah, but I can't take
the entire company

41:40.498 --> 41:41.633
back to the beach.

41:41.667 --> 41:43.802
Well, then just bring
the beach to the stage.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.036
Okay.

41:45.070 --> 41:46.304
Okay.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.173
How much do you want
to spend on that?

41:48.206 --> 41:49.841
(chuckles)

41:49.875 --> 41:52.143
I am not spending
anything on that, Bob.

41:52.177 --> 41:54.012
That's coming
out of your end.

41:54.045 --> 41:56.514
I'm going to New York to
see My Fair Fucking Lady.

41:56.548 --> 41:58.516
Just do it by the time
I get back, all right?

42:00.852 --> 42:02.821
And get that hangdog expression
of your face.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.723
Come on, come on.

42:04.756 --> 42:07.158
It's not like you just took
a dump all over Casablanca.

42:07.192 --> 42:09.160
It's a B movie.

42:09.194 --> 42:11.029
It's always been a B movie.

42:11.062 --> 42:12.998
Always will be a B movie.

42:13.031 --> 42:14.600
B, B, B, B...

42:28.880 --> 42:30.081
This?

42:31.382 --> 42:32.784
Toss that
in the box.

42:34.886 --> 42:36.254
You know, there
was a time when

42:36.287 --> 42:37.723
I wouldn't be the
one doing this,

42:37.756 --> 42:40.091
I would be off to
my next project.

42:40.125 --> 42:42.427
But now it's not even clear
there will be a next project.

42:46.965 --> 42:48.266
B.D.?

42:49.768 --> 42:52.237
(voice breaking):
I'm sorry I wasn't better.

42:53.271 --> 42:55.206
I wanted to do
a good job.

42:55.240 --> 42:57.709
Oh, sweetheart,
you did a fine job.

42:57.743 --> 43:00.111
You did a very
fine job.

43:00.145 --> 43:01.546
A creditable job.

43:01.579 --> 43:03.381
I mean, it was your
first picture.

43:03.414 --> 43:05.050
You looked
beautiful.

43:05.083 --> 43:07.719
And you...
spoke clearly.

43:07.753 --> 43:09.387
You hit your marks,

43:09.420 --> 43:11.790
you didn't look
into the lens once,

43:11.823 --> 43:13.058
not once.

43:13.091 --> 43:15.293
You make it look so easy.

43:15.326 --> 43:17.996
(sighs)

43:18.930 --> 43:20.598
I hope I didn't ruin it.

43:23.001 --> 43:25.904
If Crawford couldn't
ruin the picture,

43:25.937 --> 43:27.172
nobody could.

43:28.774 --> 43:30.776
*

44:00.806 --> 44:02.808
*

44:07.813 --> 44:09.815
(cranking, music box plays)

44:40.678 --> 44:42.313
JOAN:
You might want to
take special note

44:42.347 --> 44:43.815
of my
projected income,

44:43.849 --> 44:46.684
I have a new picture
coming out in a few months.

44:46.718 --> 44:48.319
You're clearly a woman
of means, Miss Crawford.

44:48.353 --> 44:49.855
That's not really the issue.

44:51.056 --> 44:53.892
Well, there should be no issue.

44:53.925 --> 44:57.328
It's my deepest desire
to offer a loving home

44:57.362 --> 44:58.830
to a motherless child.

44:58.864 --> 45:01.499
It's no
longer 1940.

45:01.532 --> 45:04.235
I mean, the notion of
a single mother adopting

45:04.269 --> 45:08.173
should no longer be an issue.

45:08.206 --> 45:11.009
While your marital status
may present some questions,

45:11.042 --> 45:13.779
that's not why we're turning
down your application.

45:15.046 --> 45:18.183
You're turning me down?

45:18.216 --> 45:19.417
Why?

45:19.450 --> 45:21.853
Because it's no longer 1940.

45:21.887 --> 45:23.554
You're simply
too old.

45:28.059 --> 45:29.260
(phone clicks)

45:29.294 --> 45:30.528
BETTE:
Margot?

45:30.561 --> 45:33.398
Margot, darling, it's Mummy.

45:33.431 --> 45:34.699
MARGOT: Mommie?

45:34.732 --> 45:36.734
Yes, sweetheart, how are you?

45:38.569 --> 45:42.273
Miss Ashland told me that,
uh, you've been painting

45:42.307 --> 45:44.542
some beautiful pictures.

45:44.575 --> 45:45.777
Mommie, where are you?

45:48.579 --> 45:52.383
Mummy's been working
in California.

45:52.417 --> 45:55.253
And she really misses you.

45:55.286 --> 45:57.055
(sighs)

45:57.088 --> 45:59.224
But I'm coming home soon.

45:59.257 --> 46:02.627
And, uh... well, I-I'll drive up

46:02.660 --> 46:05.396
and we'll have
a very long visit.

46:05.430 --> 46:08.633
And we'll go swimming
if it's not too chilly.

46:08.666 --> 46:09.901
Would you like that, sweetheart?

46:09.935 --> 46:11.169
(rustling)

46:13.438 --> 46:14.672
Margot?

46:17.008 --> 46:18.276
Margot?

46:21.146 --> 46:22.981
I'm sorry, Miss Davis.

46:23.014 --> 46:25.783
I think she got
a little distracted.

46:32.157 --> 46:33.624
I understand.

46:46.504 --> 46:48.639
Jane, I...

46:50.175 --> 46:51.542
I'm dying.

46:53.144 --> 46:55.780
There's no time.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.715
You must listen.

46:59.817 --> 47:03.354
I made you waste
your whole life,

47:03.388 --> 47:05.623
thinking you'd crippled me.

47:05.656 --> 47:08.359
Please stop.

47:10.528 --> 47:13.064
You didn't
do it, Jane.

47:14.332 --> 47:17.202
I did it myself.

47:18.369 --> 47:21.006
Don't you understand?

47:23.374 --> 47:26.677
I crippled myself.

47:30.381 --> 47:33.384
You weren't
driving that night.

47:35.686 --> 47:39.090
You were too drunk,
I wouldn't let you drive.

47:40.926 --> 47:44.062
I made you go
open the gates.

47:44.095 --> 47:47.999
I watched you get
out of the car.

47:48.033 --> 47:51.536
You'd been so cruel
to me at the party,

47:51.569 --> 47:53.038
imitating me,

47:53.071 --> 47:55.706
making people
laugh at me.

47:57.275 --> 48:01.212
I watched you
get out of the car.

48:01.246 --> 48:04.015
I wanted to run you down.

48:04.049 --> 48:05.416
Crush you.

48:08.119 --> 48:10.421
But you saw the car coming.

48:14.392 --> 48:16.261
I hit the gates.

48:18.129 --> 48:22.067
I... sn... snapped my spine.

48:27.238 --> 48:28.439
Then, you mean...

48:32.277 --> 48:35.913
...all this time
we could've been friends.

48:42.920 --> 48:44.089
Cut.
(bell rings)

48:44.122 --> 48:46.557
Print that one. Brilliant.

48:46.591 --> 48:49.394

MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
that's a wrap.
