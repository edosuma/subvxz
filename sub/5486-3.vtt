00:02.113 --> 00:04.548
[door opens]
Welcome home, Prince Leo.

00:04.549 --> 00:06.783
Behold,
one day all this will be yours.

00:06.784 --> 00:08.285
I hope you like
property taxes, kid.

00:08.286 --> 00:11.321
Oh, Danny, you're already
making lame dad jokes.

00:11.322 --> 00:13.724
I'll tell you what's a joke.
The parking at that hospital.

00:13.725 --> 00:15.125
- Danny?
- Yeah?

00:15.126 --> 00:17.594
Where's our TV?
And my laptop, and our booze.

00:17.595 --> 00:19.229
[gasps] Oh, my God,
we've been robbed.

00:19.230 --> 00:21.698
No, we haven't been robbed.

00:21.699 --> 00:24.101
- I baby proofed the place.
- Baby proofed?

00:24.102 --> 00:25.669
- Yeah.
- More like fun-proofed.

00:25.670 --> 00:27.638
Look, I read in
an article that says kids

00:27.639 --> 00:29.172
shouldn't watch screens
until they're 18.

00:29.173 --> 00:31.508
I was literally raised on TV,
and I turned out perfect.

00:31.509 --> 00:33.877
You have an attention
span of 15 seconds.

00:33.878 --> 00:35.379
What? Huh?

00:35.380 --> 00:37.214
Hey, did you disable the wifi?

00:37.215 --> 00:38.482
- Yep.
- How am I gonna turn

00:38.483 --> 00:40.884
my ill-informed mommy blog
into a book of stolen recipes?

00:40.885 --> 00:42.653
- That's my dream!
- Look, it's gonna be hard

00:42.654 --> 00:43.754
for me too.
Giving up the Weather Channel

00:43.755 --> 00:45.589
Especially in an El Nino year.

00:45.590 --> 00:47.391
Yeah. You do love El Nino.

00:47.392 --> 00:48.859
We're both in this
together, okay?

00:48.860 --> 00:51.094
Look at him.
He's all that matters.

00:51.095 --> 00:54.965
- I love this guy.
- Hey, did you find my gun?

00:54.966 --> 00:58.735
There's a gun in here?

00:58.736 --> 01:02.239
No.

01:02.240 --> 01:03.907
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

01:03.908 --> 01:06.543
[playful music]

01:06.544 --> 01:08.512
Found it. It was in the toilet.

01:08.513 --> 01:12.182

[speaking Italian]

01:21.693 --> 01:23.860
Danny, what does that mean?

01:23.861 --> 01:27.861
A beautiful boy
could only come from

01:28.099 --> 01:30.300
such a beautiful mother?

01:30.301 --> 01:31.868
Danny, I love that.

01:31.869 --> 01:33.236
I'm gonna get
that as a tramp stamp.

01:33.237 --> 01:35.706
- Yeah?
- That's gorgeous.

01:35.707 --> 01:39.242
Come here.
[sighs]

01:39.243 --> 01:42.112
How am I supposed to go
back to work tomorrow?

01:42.113 --> 01:43.680
Maybe I should take
paternity leave.

01:43.681 --> 01:47.050
[moaning]

01:47.051 --> 01:49.453
Are you kidding me?
Sex noises again?

01:49.454 --> 01:51.388
- It's ridiculous.
- The third time this week.

01:51.389 --> 01:52.956
- It's disgusting.
- I'm getting a UTI

01:52.957 --> 01:54.324
just thinking about it.

01:54.325 --> 01:56.493
You know what we used to do
when we heard sex noises?

01:56.494 --> 01:59.630
We would just turn the volume
up on the TV, so maybe...

01:59.631 --> 02:01.632
We should go next
door and talk to her

02:01.633 --> 02:03.333
because we're not
bringing back the TV.

02:03.334 --> 02:05.736
- Yes. Great idea.
- But... but...

02:05.737 --> 02:07.871
- Let's do it. Come on, babe.
- Okay.

02:10.008 --> 02:11.274
Just one sec, guys.

02:11.275 --> 02:13.310
Just fool around with each
other for a minute, okay?

02:13.311 --> 02:14.711
- Yeah?
- Can you quiet it down?

02:14.712 --> 02:17.547
This is a family building,
not the last days of Rome.

02:17.548 --> 02:19.216
Yeah, yeah, you guys are
the old married couple

02:19.217 --> 02:20.784
- that live next door.
- I'm sorry, old?

02:20.785 --> 02:23.153
No, no, no, no.
Him, maybe. Not me.

02:23.154 --> 02:24.388
I'm essentially a child bride.

02:24.389 --> 02:27.090
Okay, regardless,
this is a family building,

02:27.091 --> 02:29.526
so can you dial it down
a couple of shades of Grey?

02:29.527 --> 02:30.861
Okay, so I have
to sit and listen

02:30.862 --> 02:32.329
to your baby cry all night?

02:32.330 --> 02:35.032
I'd rather die
than dial anything down

02:35.033 --> 02:37.034
for a couple of smug breeders
because in six months

02:37.035 --> 02:38.568
when you guys move
out to Scarsdale

02:38.569 --> 02:41.171
and you get fat and you die,
I'm gonna be here

02:41.172 --> 02:43.974
partying with the anorexic gay
couple that moves in, okay?

02:43.975 --> 02:46.209
- Okay, all right.
- All right.

02:46.210 --> 02:47.411
Oh.

02:47.412 --> 02:49.312
Okay, so we agreed, no screens,

02:49.313 --> 02:51.314
no junk food till he's
done breastfeeding,

02:51.315 --> 02:54.317
and no going outside
till he gets his vaccinations.

02:54.318 --> 02:56.420
Except to go to
the movies with him,

02:56.421 --> 02:57.788
which is fine
because I'm ethnic.

02:57.789 --> 02:59.723
No, New York City is
the greatest city in the world,

02:59.724 --> 03:01.591
but it's a vile
cesspool of disease.

03:01.592 --> 03:03.694
We invented AIDS.

03:03.695 --> 03:05.128
Take that, San Fran.

03:05.129 --> 03:07.264
Okay. I can stay inside.

03:07.265 --> 03:09.966
Although I did email TMZ that
I'd be leaving the house today.

03:09.967 --> 03:13.203
And most important,
keep this nearby

03:13.204 --> 03:14.871
so Leo doesn't forget Papa.

03:14.872 --> 03:17.340
That's sweet, but we are
saying "daddy" and "mommy."

03:17.341 --> 03:19.476
None of this, like, Papa, Mama,

03:19.477 --> 03:23.113
European bull jive, okay?
We're Americans.

03:24.649 --> 03:25.716
No.

03:25.717 --> 03:27.050
Mi familia.

03:27.051 --> 03:29.019
Okay, you're
getting very Italian

03:29.020 --> 03:30.754
and very emotional this morning.

03:30.755 --> 03:32.756
You guys...
I love you guys so much.

03:32.757 --> 03:33.790
- Yeah.
- I love you.

03:33.791 --> 03:36.660
I love you, too.

03:36.661 --> 03:37.661
Ciao Bella.

03:37.662 --> 03:39.096
Go out and make us
some money, okay?

03:39.097 --> 03:40.297
I have very expensive habits.

03:40.298 --> 03:43.166
- I'll call you in five minutes.
- Bye, babe.

03:43.167 --> 03:45.902
So as of now, we no longer
take the API insurance,

03:45.903 --> 03:48.572
but we do take Steve
Harvey brand insurance.

03:48.573 --> 03:52.909
So nice of you to finally
join us, Dr. Castellano.

03:52.910 --> 03:55.512
Or should I say,
proud Papa Castellano.

03:55.513 --> 03:57.447
Bring it in. Bring it in.

03:57.448 --> 03:58.849
Hey, where's Dr. L?

03:58.850 --> 04:01.118
Oh, wait, let me guess.
She's at home with that baby.

04:01.119 --> 04:03.153
She's with Leo, yeah.
They're doing great.

04:03.154 --> 04:05.222
Not that anyone's asking.
She should be back

04:05.223 --> 04:07.057
about, I don't know,
8 to 12 weeks.

04:07.058 --> 04:08.358
Oh, that must be nice.

04:08.359 --> 04:10.260
I didn't get any time off
when my dog had puppies.

04:10.261 --> 04:12.529
- You took two weeks off.
- I only needed one.

04:12.530 --> 04:15.232
I totally get it. I recently
missed an important lunch

04:15.233 --> 04:17.767
because I was admiring
a butter-yellow dandelion

04:17.769 --> 04:20.070
that had forced its way
through a pavement crack.

04:20.071 --> 04:22.806
That's a weird new attitude.

04:22.807 --> 04:25.208
Yeah, Dr. Reed's been
in a real good mood

04:25.209 --> 04:27.711
since he started
getting it on the reg.

04:27.712 --> 04:29.146
On the reg with Whitney?

04:29.147 --> 04:30.280
Well...

04:30.281 --> 04:32.349
She knows you're going out,
right?

04:32.350 --> 04:33.784
Indeed she does, Danny.

04:33.785 --> 04:35.652
And I'm as happy
as a prawn in sauce.

04:35.653 --> 04:38.255
Hey, Dr. R., since you're
in such a good-ass mood,

04:38.256 --> 04:40.757
I was wondering if
we could revisit my request

04:40.758 --> 04:42.359
for a "TLC Tuesdays" dress code?

04:42.360 --> 04:43.960
TLC Tuesdays?

04:43.961 --> 04:45.962
You know, like,
I don't want no scrubs

04:45.963 --> 04:47.097
to wear on my body.

04:47.098 --> 04:49.499
No scrubs.
Well, that could be fun.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.368
Oh, my God. Thank you!

04:51.369 --> 04:52.769
It will so not
interfere with work.

04:52.770 --> 04:54.304
I just need
the next two hours off

04:54.305 --> 04:56.173
- to plan what I'm going to wear.
- Get outta here.

04:56.174 --> 04:58.608
I was planning on making
an Irish exit here,

04:58.609 --> 05:00.610
but since you're in
such a good mood,

05:00.611 --> 05:03.113
what the hell?
And my wife took me back.

05:03.114 --> 05:05.649
So I'm quitting and going
back to Philly to be with her.

05:05.650 --> 05:08.118
Adrian, that is fantastic news.

05:08.119 --> 05:09.486
No way, no. No, no, no, no.

05:09.487 --> 05:10.854
That's not fantastic.

05:10.855 --> 05:13.757
No. If he quits,
there's only two doctors here.

05:13.758 --> 05:15.258
More importantly, if he quits,

05:15.259 --> 05:17.194
I'm the only single
guy in the office.

05:17.195 --> 05:19.229
Me. The cute one.

05:19.230 --> 05:21.731
Don't get in the way of love.

05:21.732 --> 05:23.800
Oh, my little buddy, Leo, is up.

05:23.801 --> 05:26.036
What kind of trouble are
we gonna get in today?

05:26.037 --> 05:29.406
Any drama? Any fun excitement?

05:29.407 --> 05:32.375
Nothing?

05:32.376 --> 05:33.376
[sighs]

05:33.377 --> 05:35.212
[phone ringing]

05:35.213 --> 05:36.746
Oh, my God, Danny.
There's an emergency!

05:36.747 --> 05:38.415
What? Wha... wha...
wha... wha... Is Leo okay?

05:38.416 --> 05:39.549
Is he okay? What's going on?

05:39.550 --> 05:42.118
I'm so bored.

05:42.119 --> 05:44.221
- For God's sake.
- Danny, I have no internet.

05:44.222 --> 05:46.489
I have no TV.
Did you know that Leo's not even

05:46.490 --> 05:48.792
gonna talk
until he's 12 months old?

05:48.793 --> 05:50.393
Yes, we're doctors.
You didn't know that?

05:50.394 --> 05:52.896
I'm an OB-GYN, pal.
I'm not a pedo-atrician.

05:52.897 --> 05:54.197
How can you be bored?

05:54.198 --> 05:55.799
Our baby's like a work of art.

05:55.800 --> 05:58.034
It's like being at
the Guggenheim all day.

05:58.035 --> 05:59.302
Do not bring up the Guggenheim.

05:59.303 --> 06:00.904
Remember they kicked me out
for tripping and falling

06:00.905 --> 06:01.905
all the way down the spiral?

06:01.906 --> 06:03.940
I was worried this might happen,

06:03.941 --> 06:06.243
so I left you a care package.
It's in our closet.

06:06.244 --> 06:08.378
A care package? In the closet?

06:08.379 --> 06:10.146
- Mindy?
- Thank you, Danny!

06:10.147 --> 06:12.816
All right.

06:12.817 --> 06:15.385
Leo, your daddy
gave me a present.

06:15.386 --> 06:18.555
Ugh! Books? Come on, dude.

06:18.556 --> 06:19.556
[sighs]

06:19.557 --> 06:21.725
Okay...

06:21.726 --> 06:22.893
[sighs]

06:22.894 --> 06:25.095
What do we got here? Ahem.

06:25.096 --> 06:29.032
"Jack Sprat could eat no fat,
his wife could eat no lean."

06:29.033 --> 06:31.935
Okay, this is hitting
a little too close to home.

06:31.936 --> 06:34.371
Now, let's...

06:34.372 --> 06:37.507
"The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn."

06:37.508 --> 06:40.710
Certainly has a lot of
the N-word like a Kanye song.

06:40.711 --> 06:43.813
Oh, no, but it has
a message like a Common song.

06:43.814 --> 06:46.182
No, thank you.

06:46.183 --> 06:48.184
Hmm. I hear this
one's pretty good.

06:48.185 --> 06:50.387
Very violent.

06:50.388 --> 06:51.888
How can a book with
this many Jews in it

06:51.889 --> 06:53.890
not have a single joke?

06:55.192 --> 06:57.260
So, how are we feeling
these days, Mr. Reese?

06:57.261 --> 06:58.461
There you go.

06:58.462 --> 07:00.497
My husband left a year ago

07:00.498 --> 07:03.433
and I've only recently felt
like I'm ready to love again.

07:03.434 --> 07:06.036
Me and you both, sister,
'cause I'm single

07:06.037 --> 07:08.471
and I'm looking for
a nice girl to take care of.

07:08.472 --> 07:12.472
Well, you know,
we're kind of in the same boat.

07:13.244 --> 07:14.678
It might be fun if you and I...
[phone ringing]

07:14.679 --> 07:16.112
Shh! Quiet. Quiet. Stop, stop.

07:16.113 --> 07:17.347
That's Dr. L's ring.

07:17.348 --> 07:18.515
Okay.

07:18.516 --> 07:20.784
Hey, Dr. L,
I guess you butt dialed me.

07:20.785 --> 07:23.320
I'm gonna hand up on myself.
So sorry to waste your time.

07:23.321 --> 07:25.789
Wait, no, Morgan. Don't hang up.

07:25.790 --> 07:27.290
- Hello?
- I called you on purpose.

07:27.291 --> 07:28.625
What's going on in the office?

07:28.626 --> 07:30.126
This is a social call?

07:30.127 --> 07:33.697
Yeah, this is a social call.

07:33.698 --> 07:35.665
Waited my whole life for this.

07:35.666 --> 07:36.800
I am so bored.

07:36.801 --> 07:37.834
I'm finally getting around

07:37.835 --> 07:39.936
to writing my sweet
16 thank you cards.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.871
Well, oh, yeah,
my love life's in the toilet.

07:41.872 --> 07:43.506
- Okay.
- It there not one woman

07:43.507 --> 07:46.509
out there who is willing
to date a nice, poor man?

07:46.510 --> 07:47.811
It sounds good to me.

07:47.812 --> 07:50.780
Shh! Please, can you be quiet?
I'm on the phone.

07:50.781 --> 07:52.048
Eileen, I need you to be quite.

07:52.049 --> 07:53.083
You talking to me?

07:53.084 --> 07:54.818
This is a freaking big one.

07:54.819 --> 07:57.320
Hello?

07:58.856 --> 08:01.791
Wait. That's the minimum wage?

08:01.792 --> 08:03.693
Nobody tell Morgan.

08:03.694 --> 08:06.563
Finally, some real news. An ad.

08:06.564 --> 08:09.032
Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal
are signing copies

08:09.033 --> 08:10.166
of their new cookbook.

08:10.167 --> 08:13.003
Jake and Maggie are
my favorite actor siblings.

She's too scared to tell him

16:02.539 --> 16:04.774
she took their son to
a book signing today.

16:04.775 --> 16:06.843
Okay. You took Leo where?

16:06.844 --> 16:08.144
I was dying in here.

16:08.145 --> 16:09.545
Your care package actually
was all package and no care.

16:09.546 --> 16:11.013
This is the ultimate betrayal.

16:11.014 --> 16:13.082
That's nothing.
I went into his office today.

16:13.083 --> 16:16.219
He has a nanny cam
on Dr. L all day.

16:16.220 --> 16:17.753
- What?
- What?

16:17.754 --> 16:18.955
A nanny cam?

16:18.956 --> 16:20.022
That's not what they said.

16:20.023 --> 16:21.424
Where is it, Danny?

16:21.425 --> 16:23.392
I didn't hear...
I didn't hear them say that.

16:23.393 --> 16:24.961
[gasps] Is it in
the picture frame?

16:24.962 --> 16:25.962
Ow, ow, ow.

16:29.973 --> 16:31.338
A nanny cam, Danny?

16:31.339 --> 16:33.336
I can't believe you
wouldn't trust me.

16:33.337 --> 16:34.804
Trust you? Are you kidding me?

16:34.805 --> 16:36.138
Your first day alone with Leo

16:36.139 --> 16:38.174
you expose him to Jake
Gyllenhaal's germs

16:38.175 --> 16:39.809
and then locked him
inside our apartment?

16:39.810 --> 16:41.177
You liked "Southpaw."

16:41.178 --> 16:43.346
Yeah, well, I didn't love
"Brokeback Mountain."

16:43.347 --> 16:45.114
- Danny!
- It wasn't my kind of movie.

16:45.115 --> 16:46.482
You know what? It is not fair

16:46.483 --> 16:48.885
that I am locked here
with zero entertainment.

16:48.886 --> 16:50.953
I just want what's best for Leo.

16:50.954 --> 16:52.722
And I don't?

16:52.723 --> 16:54.290
[knocking]

16:54.291 --> 16:56.259
- Who the hell's that?
- Who the hell is that?

16:56.260 --> 16:59.061
I'm trying to have
a fight with my wife.

16:59.062 --> 17:01.664
Hey, man, it's kinda hard
to maintain an erection

17:01.665 --> 17:03.799
when I can hear my bosses
yelling at each other.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.568
Two people are trying
to sex in there

17:05.569 --> 17:07.303
and your old-people fighting,
it's too much.

17:07.304 --> 17:09.539
It's... it's draining
our juices. Tell 'em, baby.

17:09.540 --> 17:11.339
Uh, I think maybe
we should call it a night.

17:11.340 --> 17:12.474
We're gonna call it...
what, what?

17:12.476 --> 17:14.277
No, see what's happening?

17:14.278 --> 17:15.778
Two minutes ago, she was like...

17:15.779 --> 17:17.680
[imitates moaning]

17:17.681 --> 17:20.182
But then...
[imitates muffled shouting]

17:20.183 --> 17:22.551
Bah, bah, bah.
Muh, muh, muh, muh, muh.

17:22.553 --> 17:24.753
Bah, bah, bah. Shut up!

17:24.755 --> 17:26.388
You know what, Morgan?
It's actually not a problem

17:26.390 --> 17:28.791
because I've been cooped up
in this apartment all day

17:28.792 --> 17:31.060
and I think it would be kinda
fun to sneak out to get a drink.

17:31.061 --> 17:32.328
- What?
- Okay, fine.

17:32.329 --> 17:34.263
Yeah, if...
if that's okay with you, master.

17:34.264 --> 17:35.798
- A drink?
- It's fine, yes.

17:35.799 --> 17:37.133
He controls where
I go and when I go.

17:37.134 --> 17:38.234
- Oh, that's not right, either.
- No, no, no.

17:38.235 --> 17:39.435
- Is that okay?
- Let her go.

17:39.436 --> 17:41.404
- A drink? A drink!
- Quiet.

17:41.405 --> 17:43.839
- Ai maron!
- Stop it, stop it.

17:43.840 --> 17:45.775
Oh, my God. It is so trashy.

17:45.776 --> 17:49.776
I'm so sorry.
You ready for round two, mama?

17:50.047 --> 17:51.447
Yeah, good idea.

17:51.448 --> 17:53.282
I... I'm gonna hand with Dr. C.

17:53.283 --> 17:54.483
I think he needs my help, so...

17:54.484 --> 17:57.687
Oh, my God. Dr. C?

17:57.688 --> 18:00.456
Dr. C, I think
the wind blew the door.

18:00.457 --> 18:01.891
[lounge music playing]

18:01.892 --> 18:03.626
[chuckles]

18:03.627 --> 18:06.596
- Tamra.
- Come on.

18:06.597 --> 18:08.097
How could you?

18:08.098 --> 18:10.132
Is this because Dr. Reed
has a weird enormous head?

18:10.133 --> 18:12.301
- Okay, I have tall hair.
- Jeremy?

18:12.302 --> 18:14.503
Tamar? What are you doing here?

18:14.504 --> 18:17.006
We are here to show you
the face of devastation,

18:17.007 --> 18:18.608
specifically mine.

18:18.609 --> 18:19.709
Hi, I'm Gerald.

18:19.710 --> 18:21.210
Oh, forgive me. Jeremy Reed.

18:21.211 --> 18:22.812
- Don't shake his hand!
- Right.

18:22.813 --> 18:24.981
I heard you on the phone,
"Whiteney."

18:24.982 --> 18:26.782
Scheming to meet this Gerald

18:26.783 --> 18:28.050
while Dr. Reed's
back was turned.

18:28.051 --> 18:30.920
Oh, my... you think
I'm cheating with Gerald?

18:30.921 --> 18:32.254
Well, how else do
you explain it?

18:32.255 --> 18:34.223
Actually, this is not a good
time to talk about this, okay?

18:34.224 --> 18:35.224
- Great.
- Nah.

18:35.225 --> 18:38.094
Explain yourself right now.

18:38.095 --> 18:39.629
- [clears throat]
- Okay.

18:39.630 --> 18:41.797
You want the truth?

18:42.933 --> 18:45.601
For the past month,
I have been planning

18:45.602 --> 18:49.038
a surprise engagement party
for my coworker, Gerald.

18:49.039 --> 18:50.640
- Really?
- [sighs]

18:50.641 --> 18:52.408
I would have been so surprised.

18:52.409 --> 18:54.377
Then why the hell are
you two sitting out here?

18:54.378 --> 18:58.581
Because we're waiting
for his fiance, John.

18:58.582 --> 19:01.784
So, when you said
he doesn't suspect anything,

19:01.785 --> 19:03.119
he's an idiot...

19:03.120 --> 19:04.854
I was talking about Gerald.

19:04.855 --> 19:06.322
Yeah.

19:06.323 --> 19:09.558
I'm just gonna go home.

19:09.559 --> 19:12.128
Oh, okay. That makes sense.

19:12.129 --> 19:15.164
But the good news is,
you two are still together,

19:15.165 --> 19:16.666
so we can keep TLC Tuesdays,
right?

19:16.667 --> 19:19.235
No, from now on every day
is business formal day.

19:19.236 --> 19:20.369
No.

19:20.370 --> 19:22.605
I just bought
a completely clear top.

19:22.606 --> 19:23.939
[groans]

19:23.940 --> 19:26.976
[bar music playing]

19:26.977 --> 19:28.344
Ahem, excuse me?

19:28.345 --> 19:30.046
I would like your finest
body shot, please.

19:30.047 --> 19:31.280
You got it.

19:31.281 --> 19:33.082
Good news, I can stay.

19:33.083 --> 19:34.417
Told the wife
I was working late.

19:34.418 --> 19:35.685
[imitates explosion] Crushed it.

19:35.686 --> 19:37.186
Huge, bro.

19:37.187 --> 19:39.155
Here's to getting home after
the kids are bathed and asleep.

19:39.156 --> 19:40.923
- Cheers.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:40.924 --> 19:43.225
Are you dudes for real?
You two would have rather

19:43.226 --> 19:45.761
stay out here and drink than go
home and be with your babies?

19:45.762 --> 19:47.663
As a mother, you disgust me.

19:47.664 --> 19:50.232
Well, as a mother, what
the hell are you doing here?

19:50.233 --> 19:51.400
For your information,
I am taking a break

19:51.401 --> 19:52.468
'cause it's all too much.

19:52.469 --> 19:54.770
That's exactly what we're doing.

19:54.771 --> 19:56.839
I-I can't believe it.
Your poor wives.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.140
I mean, honestly.

19:58.141 --> 19:59.475
I bet they would
kill to be married

19:59.476 --> 20:00.810
to an over-protective psycho

20:00.811 --> 20:02.111
who's obsessed with their kid.

20:02.112 --> 20:03.512
If I wanted to get told
off by an Indian woman,

20:03.513 --> 20:05.114
I'd tell my doctor how
much I actually drink.

20:05.115 --> 20:07.049
Whoa, you don't know
what her day was like.

20:07.050 --> 20:08.651
Baby's probably
driving her crazy.

20:08.652 --> 20:10.252
She's got it as bad as us.

20:10.253 --> 20:12.021
Actually, my baby's an angel

20:12.022 --> 20:14.256
and his father is a saint.

20:14.257 --> 20:16.392
I should bounce.
I'm really sorry, guys.

20:16.393 --> 20:17.993
I-I thought you
were these, like,

20:17.994 --> 20:19.729
finance "American
Psycho" wannabes,

20:19.730 --> 20:22.164
but, like, you're just creeps.

20:22.165 --> 20:24.324
Catch you later, dudes.

20:24.638 --> 20:27.705
OMG. That girl wasn't cheating
anow now my boss hater me.

20:27.706 --> 20:29.193
Where you at?

20:29.451 --> 20:32.765
White House situation room.
Syria's wack right now.

20:33.112 --> 20:35.574
Well, for now on, I should
mind my own business.

20:35.575 --> 20:37.847
That's what I keep telling
these fools about Syria.

20:37.848 --> 20:40.316
[plastic clatters]

20:40.317 --> 20:42.818
[playful music]

20:42.819 --> 20:45.955
Hmm.

20:45.956 --> 20:48.157
[sniffing]

20:48.158 --> 20:51.527
[gasps]

20:51.528 --> 20:53.028
Mind your business, Tamra.

20:54.431 --> 20:55.765
[door opens]

20:57.534 --> 20:59.435
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:59.436 --> 21:01.837
I went and picked you up one
of those sandwiches you like

21:01.838 --> 21:03.105
with all the leaves
inside of it.

21:03.106 --> 21:04.840
Lettuce?

21:04.841 --> 21:06.408
Thanks, babe.

21:06.409 --> 21:07.409
How's he doing?

21:07.410 --> 21:10.112
- He's doing great.
- Yeah.

21:10.113 --> 21:14.350
You know, I was wrong
to use the nanny cam.

21:14.351 --> 21:18.454
It's our first baby
and I was just a little nervous.

21:18.455 --> 21:21.423
But of course I trust you,
Mindy.

21:21.424 --> 21:22.858
That's a nice thing to say.

21:22.859 --> 21:25.294
And I didn't do it just
to keep an eye out.

21:25.295 --> 21:28.430
I wanted a way to check in
when I was missing you two.

21:28.431 --> 21:29.665
Why didn't you just tell me?

21:29.666 --> 21:33.202
I would have done, like,
a sexy strip tease for you.

21:33.203 --> 21:35.504
And I definitely wouldn't
have eaten that scab.

21:35.505 --> 21:36.839
- What?
- Nothing, nothing.

21:36.840 --> 21:37.940
I have to tell you
something, too.

21:37.941 --> 21:39.241
Okay.

21:39.242 --> 21:41.877
I am so happy
that the father of my son

21:41.878 --> 21:43.879
wants to be
so involved in his life.

21:43.880 --> 21:46.215
I'm really lucky.

21:46.216 --> 21:48.517
But you have to just
let me be a mom the way

21:48.518 --> 21:50.586
that I know how to.

21:50.587 --> 21:51.620
And I'm going to make mistakes,

21:51.621 --> 21:52.888
like a lot of mistakes.

21:52.889 --> 21:55.391
Like, more mistakes
than pretty much anyone,

21:55.392 --> 21:58.794
but I think Leo will be okay.

21:58.795 --> 22:00.663
Because we'll balance
each other out.

22:00.664 --> 22:03.265
Yeah, as long as we both
compromise a little.

22:03.266 --> 22:06.602
No, that's not what I said.

22:06.603 --> 22:07.937
Yeah.

22:07.938 --> 22:09.238
[gasps] Oh, my God.

22:09.239 --> 22:10.773
What a crazy night, am I right?

22:10.774 --> 22:12.575
- Cover up.
- We are so lucky

22:12.576 --> 22:13.709
that we have each other.

22:13.710 --> 22:15.978
Do I like Leo right now?
No, I don't.

22:15.979 --> 22:18.414
But I will learn to love him
and he will learn to love me.

22:18.415 --> 22:20.916
Morgan, I can see your penis.

22:20.917 --> 22:23.052
Oh, my God! Oh, God.
