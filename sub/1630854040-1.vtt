01:18.145 --> 01:20.080
I know what you're thinking.

01:20.213 --> 01:23.150
Pretty weird choice
for a host, huh?

01:23.283 --> 01:28.388
Who better than a sneaky little
bad boy rolling around town such
as myself?

01:28.523 --> 01:30.758
Let me straight up with you.

01:30.892 --> 01:33.828
This is the kind of place it's
going to make you feel
uncomfortable.

01:33.962 --> 01:36.030
I can promise you that.

01:36.163 --> 01:37.665
You may laugh.

01:37.932 --> 01:39.734
You may get offended.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.002
Don't worry,

01:41.134 --> 01:43.671
that's the whole
fucking point.

01:43.805 --> 01:47.307
You see here we don't
believe in dreams.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.777
We live in nightmares.

01:50.210 --> 01:51.846
Still don't get it yet,

01:51.980 --> 01:53.180
do ya?

01:54.082 --> 01:55.683
Speaking of not
getting it to the

01:55.817 --> 01:58.920
right of me is the
Thompsons residence.

01:59.053 --> 02:04.124
On the surface, Thompson seems
like your everyday all American
young couple.

02:04.257 --> 02:06.894
But tonight that's
going to change.

02:07.028 --> 02:08.096
For tonight...

02:08.228 --> 02:09.731
Is game night.

02:24.879 --> 02:26.146
Uh oh.

02:26.346 --> 02:29.216
Who invited these guys,
come on guys welcome in!

02:29.349 --> 02:30.785
Good to see you,
good to see you!

02:30.918 --> 02:32.787
We got wine and
stuff girls, IPA for the

02:32.920 --> 02:34.722
big man, and we
got a bunch of chips.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.291
Basically used to be,
but I don't remember being.

02:38.425 --> 02:40.394
I don't ever and I've
seen any man.

02:40.528 --> 02:41.863
Well I can't do the math.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.931
- I can't do the trick.
- I have the magic.

03:07.789 --> 03:09.590
Uh oh. My turn?

03:09.724 --> 03:11.959
Right hand blue.
- Blue.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.630
Alright brace for impact guys
I'm bending over for this
one, so...

03:16.898 --> 03:17.999
That's what she said.

03:21.268 --> 03:22.302
Who's she?

03:26.507 --> 03:28.943
That's funny.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.779
Who is she?

03:37.417 --> 03:39.286
Are you serious?

03:41.354 --> 03:42.724
No.

03:55.103 --> 03:56.537
Left hand red.

04:14.222 --> 04:17.424
- Goodnight guys!
- What are you talking about?

04:17.558 --> 04:19.594
- Have a good night.
- Thank you guys.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.062
Good night!
- Bye!

04:21.195 --> 04:24.165
Yeah great, thanks for coming.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.134
You OK?
- Yeah.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.502
Okay.

04:35.877 --> 04:37.444
<i>That's what he said.</i>

04:39.647 --> 04:40.748
<i>Who is she?</i>

04:40.882 --> 04:43.050
<i>She.</i>

05:20.721 --> 05:22.690
OK, so I saw those curtains
on Wayfair,

05:22.824 --> 05:25.593
the uhm, the space curtains.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.195
It sounds ugly
but it's not.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.263
It's really cute

05:29.396 --> 05:31.098
<i>so I'm</i>
<i>thinking the space</i>
<i>curtains in the</i>

05:31.232 --> 05:34.068
<i>bedroom and then we move</i>
<i>the bedroom curtains into</i>

05:34.202 --> 05:37.337
<i>the other rooms and nobody</i>
<i>ever has to see it again.</i>

05:37.470 --> 05:38.573
<i>It's disgusting.</i>

05:38.706 --> 05:40.074
<i>Then we can move...</i>

05:43.711 --> 05:46.479
Yeah, once we do that then.

05:52.987 --> 05:55.957
You know what I mean?

05:57.091 --> 05:59.193
Anyway, yeah, so I think
you could do that...

06:28.522 --> 06:30.691
Who is she?

06:58.686 --> 07:00.721
Hey honey.

07:00.855 --> 07:01.889
Uhm...

07:02.455 --> 07:04.692
What's going on here?

07:07.595 --> 07:12.767
OK, because you know
it's one thing if you can't
do the dishes,

07:12.900 --> 07:18.438
but it looks like you're
peeing in jars so...

07:20.875 --> 07:22.109
Dishes...

07:23.177 --> 07:24.477
Oh, the dishes...

07:24.612 --> 07:26.547
- Yeah, the dishes.

07:27.048 --> 07:28.816
It's what I said.

07:32.153 --> 07:33.187
What?

07:33.654 --> 07:36.456
Did you shit on the fridge?

07:39.694 --> 07:41.829
That's what you said.

07:45.166 --> 07:46.834
Excuse me.

07:47.501 --> 07:48.936
You said?

07:49.904 --> 07:51.205
Honey.

07:52.106 --> 07:54.508
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

07:56.077 --> 07:59.547
You know how hard things have
been for me?

07:59.680 --> 08:03.317
Oh my God.
- I've been having some ideas.

08:03.451 --> 08:05.886
Floating around in my head.

08:06.020 --> 08:09.156
Trying to figure out who she is.

08:09.290 --> 08:11.625
Who's she?

08:12.259 --> 08:13.828
There you are.

08:14.528 --> 08:15.896
You...

08:16.664 --> 08:18.899
that's what you said.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.769
It's what you said.

08:22.370 --> 08:26.273
That's what you said, honey.
That's what you said...

08:26.407 --> 08:28.809
- I don't know what you're
talking about...
- That's what you said!

08:28.943 --> 08:31.312
That's what you said.

08:31.445 --> 08:33.914
Okay stop, please, stop okay.

08:34.048 --> 08:38.486
Just just breathe
okay let's just breathe.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.021
OK.

08:40.488 --> 08:42.723
Honey look at yourself.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.693
What are you talking about?

08:45.893 --> 08:49.130
I'm sorry I don't know
what I did.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.032
I didn't mean to do anything.

08:51.165 --> 08:52.299
I'm so sorry,

08:53.134 --> 08:54.535
Okay?

08:56.537 --> 08:59.508
I just want my husband back.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.375
Can I have him back?

09:02.343 --> 09:05.212
Can I just have my normal
husband back OK?

09:05.346 --> 09:06.847
You're right.

09:08.749 --> 09:09.650
I'm so sorry.

09:09.784 --> 09:11.285
- It's okay...

09:15.122 --> 09:16.757
Well, I've been acting weird.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.161
I've been, uh,

09:20.628 --> 09:22.730
acting strange so...

09:24.732 --> 09:26.033
It's embarrassing.

09:26.167 --> 09:27.201
Uh.

09:28.069 --> 09:29.070
All right.

09:29.336 --> 09:34.041
Mid life crisis alert, I'm gonna
do the dishes.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.912
Sorry about that.

09:38.513 --> 09:40.014
Uh.

09:40.549 --> 09:41.849
Don't know what that was so...

09:43.417 --> 09:44.752
Let me just...

09:55.663 --> 09:58.699
No. No honey,
there is one thing.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.835
About the dishes.

10:04.539 --> 10:06.273
I could use a hand.

10:14.048 --> 10:16.050
- Get it in the hole!
- Help me!

10:16.183 --> 10:17.586
- Please!
- Get in the hole!

10:17.718 --> 10:19.253
Just get it in the hole!

10:19.386 --> 10:23.558
Squeal like a pig baby!
Scream like a freaking baby!

10:23.691 --> 10:25.259
Fucking baby!

10:30.664 --> 10:31.732
It's game night.

10:37.606 --> 10:39.039
- She has a fan.

10:40.474 --> 10:41.543
- No.

11:03.898 --> 11:06.000
I am she.

11:07.536 --> 11:09.904
Oh my God,

11:10.639 --> 11:14.375
I'm so sorry you guys...

11:14.842 --> 11:16.210
- What are you
doing bud?

11:16.343 --> 11:18.679
I am her, she is me.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.814
I am always she.

11:21.382 --> 11:23.717
Call 911?

11:24.185 --> 11:25.252
Please.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.056
Okay...

11:44.038 --> 11:46.740
It's OK, honey,
we're right behind you, OK?

11:58.319 --> 11:59.621
Alright.

12:00.154 --> 12:02.823
Your wife's pretty cute man.

12:02.957 --> 12:04.225
Gonna have to get
you better,

12:04.358 --> 12:06.293
or I'm going to steal
her from you.

12:06.427 --> 12:08.362
Heart rate is dropping
seems to be leveling out.

12:08.495 --> 12:12.199
Sir, can you hear us?

12:12.534 --> 12:15.202
Sir, nod if you can hear us, OK.

12:15.436 --> 12:17.706
Looks like someone's
coming back to reality.

12:17.838 --> 12:22.176
You're gonna feel a little pinch
here on the count of three, OK?

12:22.309 --> 12:23.978
1...2...3...

12:24.111 --> 12:27.915
It's gonna make you feel
a lot better.

12:28.315 --> 12:29.817
How's that feel?

12:29.984 --> 12:31.218
It feel...

12:31.385 --> 12:32.687
It feels good.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.188
I feel good.

12:37.726 --> 12:39.927
That's what she said.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.764
We're coming in with a male
unknown-

12:47.001 --> 12:49.303
That doesn't sound good.

12:49.704 --> 12:54.375
See that's why I gotta stop
taking these night shifts.

12:54.509 --> 12:55.809
I can tell you.

12:56.176 --> 13:00.114
Nothing good ever happens
after 10:00 PM.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.248
Anyways.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.083
I'm hungry.

13:09.758 --> 13:11.925
<i>This is Edna.</i>

13:14.395 --> 13:19.466
<i>She's full of dreams and ideas</i>
<i>that never came to be.</i>

13:20.801 --> 13:23.037
<i>She spends most nights</i>
<i>here crying alone</i>

13:23.170 --> 13:25.306
<i>in this dusty kitchen.</i>

13:25.640 --> 13:30.077
<i>Revisiting the better times</i>
<i>of her memory.</i>

13:31.312 --> 13:34.281
Pretty depressing stuff,
huh?

13:34.549 --> 13:37.851
The only clear and constant
thought that crosses her mind.

13:37.985 --> 13:40.954
Is if she only had a man
to get through life with,

13:41.088 --> 13:42.856
maybe things will get better

13:42.990 --> 13:45.859
but only had a man
to get through life with.

13:45.993 --> 13:49.029
Maybe things will get better.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.101
Trip to Aspen this year
was amazing.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.136
So incredible yeah,
we stayed at the scene.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.773
Yeah.
- Oh my God I love it.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.307
It was so nice.

14:04.378 --> 14:07.414
Yeah no but the spa's
way better.

14:07.782 --> 14:11.118
It's way better.
And Stephen took his clients
there last year...

14:26.534 --> 14:30.672
<i>She didn't want to be</i>
<i>here anymore.</i>

14:31.372 --> 14:33.474
<i>So she chose a bridge.</i>

14:35.777 --> 14:38.680
<i>She listened for a voice</i>
<i>to stop her.</i>

14:38.813 --> 14:40.381
<i>But it never came.</i>

14:41.215 --> 14:48.055
<i>Only the daunting whispers of</i>
<i>wind pushing her further to</i>
<i>the edge.</i>

14:51.593 --> 14:52.827
<i>Then...</i>

14:53.160 --> 14:55.730
<i>when she least expected it...</i>

14:55.864 --> 14:59.299
<i>Something grabbed her attention.</i>

16:31.893 --> 16:34.428
Oh my God, that looks so good.

16:34.829 --> 16:37.966
Oh I've also been spitballing
some names.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.636
What do you think
about Ricky, hmmm?

16:42.637 --> 16:43.805
Yay or nay?

16:45.540 --> 16:46.340
Yay!

16:46.473 --> 16:48.208
Ready! Here comes the airplane.

16:57.217 --> 17:02.657
<i>She finally found a man</i>
<i>to get through life with.</i>

17:02.790 --> 17:04.759
<i>Things were better.</i>

17:06.460 --> 17:10.097
<i>He was everything she</i>
<i>ever wanted.</i>

17:10.932 --> 17:12.567
<i>A good listener.</i>

17:14.936 --> 17:17.170
<i>A shoulder to lean on.</i>

17:20.040 --> 17:22.476
<i>The strong silent type.</i>

17:25.379 --> 17:28.282
<i>The prom date she never had.</i>

17:30.417 --> 17:32.620
<i>She was so glad they met.</i>

17:32.754 --> 17:34.321
I'm so glad we met.

17:34.989 --> 17:38.425
<i>And although he may</i>
<i>have been dead.</i>

17:38.560 --> 17:41.261
<i>For the first time in years.</i>

17:41.428 --> 17:43.130
<i>She was alive.</i>

17:50.270 --> 17:51.506
Oooh.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.675
Can't even begin to tell you,

17:53.808 --> 17:58.546
how long, so long, we've been
waiting for Edna to find a man.

18:01.315 --> 18:03.317
Not that long.

18:11.258 --> 18:12.694
All right,

18:12.827 --> 18:13.728
subject change,

18:14.896 --> 18:16.496
So...Ricky,

18:16.698 --> 18:20.602
tell us about yourself,
what do you do?

18:21.636 --> 18:23.203
He's so cute,

18:23.337 --> 18:25.540
and so shy.

18:26.406 --> 18:27.709
Busy bee...
- OK, you know what,

18:27.842 --> 18:30.410
I can't, I there's
no way I can do this.

18:30.545 --> 18:32.513
Nope.
- Do what.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.282
Are you?

18:35.750 --> 18:38.987
Seriously gonna make me say
this right now.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.287
Mm-hmm

18:42.590 --> 18:43.625
He's...

18:43.758 --> 18:44.892
He's dead.

18:45.994 --> 18:47.528
He's dead.

18:47.762 --> 18:50.197
Can you please just try
and be happy for me just
for once

18:50.330 --> 18:51.799
I would be happy for you if you

18:51.933 --> 18:54.234
brought a boyfriend
along that was alive.

18:54.368 --> 18:57.605
- God. Can you stop?
- He's not so.

18:57.772 --> 18:58.740
He's not.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.575
I get it all right.

19:00.708 --> 19:02.977
Please stop.
- Edna.

19:03.111 --> 19:05.312
- You're embarrassing me
in front of my date.
- You can't do this.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.147
- Yes I can.
- There's nobody...

19:07.280 --> 19:08.850
Oh my God!

19:08.983 --> 19:10.685
- No.
- Oh God uhm.

19:12.620 --> 19:14.454
I find a man that I am
in love with

19:14.589 --> 19:16.189
and you can't even be
happy for me.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.192
It's disgusting. I would not
tell her what is going on here,

19:19.326 --> 19:21.161
- I...uhm...
- Yo.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.329
Help me out here.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.364
Uhm...Well.

19:27.001 --> 19:29.504
Yeah, it's pretty disturbing.

19:29.637 --> 19:30.437
Edna.

19:30.571 --> 19:32.339
You can't do this.

19:32.707 --> 19:37.344
I'm really worried
about your mental health.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.748
Fine.

19:41.983 --> 19:44.418
That's the way
you feel.

19:46.154 --> 19:47.622
Come on Ricky.

19:48.523 --> 19:51.959
They hate us because
they ain't us.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.761
Yeah, that's it.

19:53.895 --> 19:55.228
- Oh I'm so...

19:56.229 --> 19:57.230
sorry.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.801
Got him, there, okay...

20:00.835 --> 20:05.139
I'm never going to be able
to come here again.

20:05.272 --> 20:08.241
So I was thinking we could go to

20:08.442 --> 20:12.379
don't know the beach
or something tomorrow.

20:12.513 --> 20:16.651
I know you're not the biggest
fan of water, but.

20:16.784 --> 20:17.919
I don't know.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.756
We could do a picnic or...

20:36.504 --> 20:40.208
They never did make it
to the beach.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.443
Instead, she just stayed up
for days,

20:43.578 --> 20:47.347
fueled by her friend's
harsh opinions.

20:47.982 --> 20:50.484
In fact,
the more time that passed,

20:50.618 --> 20:54.522
the more lifeless he
seemed to become.

20:56.924 --> 20:58.626
Then once again,

20:59.093 --> 21:01.328
when she least expected.

21:01.461 --> 21:04.832
Something grabbed her attention.

24:12.620 --> 24:14.956
What happened to me?

24:18.592 --> 24:20.561
You weren't dead.

24:22.530 --> 24:25.599
And I brought you back to life.

24:28.903 --> 24:31.806
That was pretty cool of you.

24:40.348 --> 24:44.018
<i>He explained how his</i>
<i>actual name was Cider.</i>

24:44.151 --> 24:46.520
My actual name is cider.

24:47.054 --> 24:48.089
Really?

24:48.222 --> 24:49.924
- Like the drink?
- I know it's biblical.

24:50.057 --> 24:53.761
It means liqueur derived
from the juice of fruits.

24:53.894 --> 24:56.530
Yeah, so like the drink.

24:57.398 --> 24:58.666
Sure.

24:59.066 --> 25:00.201
Uh...well...

25:00.334 --> 25:02.503
It's just, I've been calling
you Ricky so...

25:02.636 --> 25:03.604
Ricky?
- Yeah.

25:03.738 --> 25:05.673
Man do I seem Latin to you?

25:05.806 --> 25:08.509
No, no, I just,
always liked that name.

25:08.642 --> 25:10.478
Let's just stick with Cider.

25:10.611 --> 25:12.213
I feel like it's part
of my core.

25:12.346 --> 25:13.681
It's part of my essence.

25:13.814 --> 25:15.649
Oh yeah, of course.

25:15.783 --> 25:17.918
I mean it is your name.

25:18.919 --> 25:21.622
Rename you that's crazy.

25:24.558 --> 25:26.093
I'm dying for a grilled cheese.

25:26.227 --> 25:27.428
Doesn't that sound good?

25:27.561 --> 25:29.430
Those are fattening.

25:29.563 --> 25:31.298
This place is really cool,

25:31.432 --> 25:33.434
but it seems like they're trying
to capitalize on a young
generation,

25:33.567 --> 25:35.202
revisiting vintage Americana,

25:35.336 --> 25:38.205
and I would think that would
include vegan options to
just show

25:38.339 --> 25:39.740
a nod to that generation.

25:39.874 --> 25:41.208
Hey, we know you,
we get you.

25:41.342 --> 25:42.543
We know what you want.

25:42.676 --> 25:44.378
Oh I didn't know you're a vegan.

25:44.513 --> 25:46.180
No I'm not.

25:48.315 --> 25:49.750
- But...

25:50.718 --> 25:54.055
You don't have to be
vegan to care.

26:01.796 --> 26:04.298
What are you laughing at?

26:04.698 --> 26:06.934
OK, be honest.
What do you think?

26:07.068 --> 26:12.740
My houseless friend Vic spent
two years collecting clothes and
reclaimed fabrics,

26:12.873 --> 26:19.847
and we gave birth to this outfit
right after our first experience
with the DMT.

26:19.980 --> 26:22.349
That's exactly what it
looks like.

26:22.483 --> 26:23.552
No,

26:23.818 --> 26:26.887
I think it makes
my ass pop too.

26:40.101 --> 26:41.202
What's uh?

26:42.303 --> 26:43.538
What's this?

26:44.438 --> 26:49.276
Well, I didn't want to come
right out and say it,
but this is me.

26:49.410 --> 26:50.644
Really?

26:51.779 --> 26:52.980
That's you.

26:53.614 --> 26:58.385
- Singing...
- Singing, drumming,
strumming, producing.

26:58.520 --> 27:01.956
I spent three years of my life
traveling with Russian hobos

27:02.089 --> 27:04.291
on the back of a cargo train
and I wrote this song.

27:04.425 --> 27:05.594
It's about that-

27:08.129 --> 27:10.397
Oh shh, shh, Shut up.

27:10.532 --> 27:11.799
Wait.

27:12.433 --> 27:14.536
This is my favorite part.

27:14.668 --> 27:16.670
This is the real genius seed.

27:29.750 --> 27:32.920
Come on, look
at what I'm doing.

28:26.440 --> 28:29.310
- Lower body. Lower.
- Like this?

28:29.443 --> 28:31.312
Like th-
Lower!

28:31.445 --> 28:32.846
Like.
- Ah.

28:32.980 --> 28:35.082
Yeah, it's not really your
fault, it's your body.

28:37.985 --> 28:40.387
OK, ready, watch this.

29:22.396 --> 29:24.699
<i>It was then she realized</i>
<i>she was never going to let</i>

29:24.832 --> 29:28.936
<i>her happiness be dependent</i>
<i>on another human again.</i>

29:29.069 --> 29:30.938
<i>As he forwarded down that river,</i>

29:31.071 --> 29:36.076
<i>she realized that true</i>
<i>importance and power of</i>
<i>independence.</i>

29:36.210 --> 29:38.279
<i>The lonesome nights and string</i>
<i>of bad dates</i>

29:38.412 --> 29:43.150
<i>were a dream compared to</i>
<i>the nightmare she called Rick.</i>

29:43.284 --> 29:45.687
<i>But whatever the fuck</i>
<i>his name was,</i>

29:45.819 --> 29:47.622
as you'll see in our next story,

29:47.756 --> 29:50.457
we're going to focus
on the power of friendship.

29:50.592 --> 29:52.627
Might want to grab some popcorn
on this one.

29:53.794 --> 29:56.130
It's about to get wild.

30:10.144 --> 30:12.479
3 little piggies
came to the market.

30:12.614 --> 30:14.783
Everyone get the fuck down.

30:14.915 --> 30:17.017
I said everyone get the
fuck down!

30:19.320 --> 30:20.921
Not you fat boy.

30:21.055 --> 30:22.423
Get up.

30:22.557 --> 30:24.559
We're going to make
this nice and easy.

30:24.693 --> 30:26.160
You do exactly as we say.

30:26.293 --> 30:28.495
Let us do our thing
and that's it.

30:28.630 --> 30:30.397
Do you understand?

30:30.532 --> 30:32.499
Do you understand!?

30:33.735 --> 30:35.069
Why you doing this?

30:35.202 --> 30:38.272
What a great question.

30:59.059 --> 31:01.763
Dude you've been looking at her all night.
Just go talk to her.

31:01.895 --> 31:03.130
Why do you do this?

31:03.263 --> 31:04.465
Do what?

31:04.932 --> 31:06.133
Push me.

31:06.266 --> 31:08.102
I don't push you. Luke
do I push him?

31:08.235 --> 31:09.370
You're trying to help?

31:09.504 --> 31:11.573
He's trying to help.
- Thank you.

31:11.706 --> 31:15.943
Listen guys, I appreciate
the sentiment and everything but
I'm fine..I...I...

31:16.076 --> 31:17.545
I don't need it.

31:17.679 --> 31:19.848
You know why you guys do this
every week after week.

31:19.980 --> 31:21.014
No.

31:21.716 --> 31:24.552
Because you guys have settled
down, we've gotten older,

31:24.686 --> 31:27.756
you've gotten comfy and listen,
there's nothing wrong with
that at all.

31:27.921 --> 31:29.256
It's totally fine,

31:29.390 --> 31:32.493
but you guys want to go
talk to a girl like that.

31:32.627 --> 31:34.194
I don't, you do.

31:34.629 --> 31:36.029
Okay.

31:36.163 --> 31:39.066
and you project that
onto me and it's-
- Wow.

31:39.199 --> 31:40.535
- I'm projecting?
- You're laughing,

31:40.668 --> 31:42.236
it's true though.
- I'm trying to help you out.

31:42.369 --> 31:43.638
What kind of friends would we be

31:43.772 --> 31:45.305
if we weren't trying to
get you laid?

31:45.439 --> 31:47.341
You guys would be
awesome friends, like friends

31:47.474 --> 31:49.511
that I would wanna come
out with every Wednesday

31:49.644 --> 31:52.079
and do this kind of shit
but this...

31:52.212 --> 31:53.882
tired of it.

31:54.014 --> 31:55.282
- Jesus man.

31:56.183 --> 32:00.789
Sorry, it's just it's more
complicated than you guys would
think okay?

32:00.954 --> 32:03.357
- What's so complicated
about it?
- There you go pushing.

32:03.490 --> 32:05.527
I'm not pushing.
I'm asking a question.

32:05.660 --> 32:06.960
- He's asking a question.

32:07.094 --> 32:08.395
A friendly question.
- It's out a concern.

32:08.530 --> 32:12.299
- Stop being so sensitive.
- I can't come.

32:12.433 --> 32:13.568
OK.

32:14.869 --> 32:16.103
Say what?

32:17.037 --> 32:18.071
I...

32:18.205 --> 32:19.541
Come here.

32:20.174 --> 32:21.709
No come here.

32:23.243 --> 32:25.078
I can't come.

32:25.914 --> 32:28.348
I've never been able to.

32:29.016 --> 32:30.718
What like never?

32:32.953 --> 32:34.188
Once.

32:35.289 --> 32:36.691
I came close.

32:38.726 --> 32:40.360
I was like 14.

32:40.961 --> 32:43.297
Was laying in bed and I.

32:43.631 --> 32:45.199
Figured why not.

32:46.400 --> 32:47.569
And so I.

32:48.135 --> 32:49.537
Was in the middle
of going at it, and I

32:49.671 --> 32:53.073
heard a window
break in the other room.

32:53.207 --> 32:54.341
And I got out of bed.

32:54.475 --> 32:56.544
I pulled up my pants and...

32:56.678 --> 32:59.246
Peaked my little head
around the corner.

32:59.379 --> 33:02.015
There was this burglar.

33:03.217 --> 33:06.320
He was just taking a bunch
of my dad's shit.

33:06.453 --> 33:09.924
- Shit, so you're like
traumatized,

33:10.290 --> 33:13.060
that's that's the thing I...

33:13.260 --> 33:15.996
I sat there and I,
I watched him.

33:16.129 --> 33:17.464
I...

33:17.866 --> 33:19.834
And lo and behold, I...

33:20.467 --> 33:22.637
Was as hard as a rock.

33:30.143 --> 33:31.613
Wait, what?

33:32.012 --> 33:35.148
It's like the more shit this guy
grabbed.

33:35.282 --> 33:37.117
And the heavier his...

33:37.251 --> 33:39.319
His breathing got.

33:39.587 --> 33:41.154
The harder I got.

33:42.557 --> 33:45.259
I was weirdly kind of hot.

33:49.864 --> 33:51.031
So like I said.

33:51.666 --> 33:55.737
It's a lot more complicated
than you would think.

33:55.870 --> 33:58.205
Yeah.

34:05.145 --> 34:07.481
So shots or...

34:08.415 --> 34:10.183
I have an idea.

34:34.642 --> 34:38.312
Take it all,
then let's kill the kid.

34:38.445 --> 34:40.615
Sounds good.

34:49.958 --> 34:53.761
Should we like cut off
his face and take turns
wearing it?

34:53.895 --> 34:55.329
Yeah.

34:59.033 --> 35:00.133
Guys I...

35:00.334 --> 35:02.102
I know it's you.

35:03.270 --> 35:05.105
Okay.
- You gotta die now!

35:05.238 --> 35:07.575
Can you get that out of my eyes please?
It's really early.

35:07.709 --> 35:09.944
- Are you hard?
- Nope.

35:10.243 --> 35:12.346
- You sure?
- Positive.

35:12.479 --> 35:14.682
- Can we see it?
- Nope.

35:15.583 --> 35:17.284
What what was it
that didn't work?

35:17.417 --> 35:20.855
I can 100%
see your faces right now.

35:22.757 --> 35:25.760
Well, that's super
disappointing.

35:25.893 --> 35:28.630
I want to go, this is stupid.

35:28.763 --> 35:29.597
Okay.

35:29.731 --> 35:32.700
- Bye dude sweet dreams.
- Yup.

36:00.327 --> 36:02.664
Jimmy, this is getting
ridiculous man.

36:02.797 --> 36:04.164
We almost had
him man.

36:04.297 --> 36:05.499
No, no, we didn't.

36:05.633 --> 36:09.003
We need something bigger,
something better.

36:09.137 --> 36:10.404
Like what?

36:17.177 --> 36:19.479
Why are you doing this?

36:19.847 --> 36:20.982
Anything?

36:21.949 --> 36:24.251
No.

36:24.384 --> 36:26.253
What about this?

36:28.056 --> 36:29.857
No no.

36:30.758 --> 36:32.192
Fuck!

36:36.097 --> 36:37.999
The fuck! No!

36:38.265 --> 36:42.603
I need you to be fucking
straight with me right here
right now, is this happening?

36:42.737 --> 36:46.040
- I don't know.
- What do you mean
you don't know!

36:46.174 --> 36:47.407
- I'm sorry!

36:51.244 --> 36:52.547
What?

36:57.552 --> 36:58.720
Get down.

36:59.721 --> 37:00.855
KCPD!

37:00.988 --> 37:02.156
- Get down!
- Put your gun down!

37:02.289 --> 37:03.758
Put your fucking gun down!

37:06.994 --> 37:10.665
Get on the ground now!
On the ground, there you go!

37:10.798 --> 37:11.999
Don't move.

37:15.703 --> 37:16.738
Oh Jesus.

37:18.206 --> 37:20.074
We gotta guy down over here.

37:50.104 --> 37:51.371
I'm sorry.

37:52.339 --> 37:54.675
This was huge mistake.

37:58.112 --> 37:59.379
No.

38:03.918 --> 38:05.485
It wasn't.

38:26.574 --> 38:27.809
We gotta go!

38:32.013 --> 38:33.781
Hold your ground!

38:41.189 --> 38:43.423
Don't do it!

38:46.093 --> 38:47.595
Drop the gun!

39:31.138 --> 39:33.708
<i>[Luke's voice) What kind of</i>
<i>friends would we be?</i>

39:33.841 --> 39:36.811
<i>If we were trying</i>
<i>to get laid.</i>

39:38.079 --> 39:41.048
<i>The best friends.</i>

39:41.182 --> 39:44.986
<i>The best freaking friends</i>
<i>I ever had.</i>

41:19.413 --> 41:22.283
Hey baby girl baby girl.

41:22.817 --> 41:27.154
Yep, I just just dropped off
my last package.

41:30.057 --> 41:31.625
That's cool.

41:32.593 --> 41:35.930
But hey listen, I got 2 words
for you

41:36.063 --> 41:37.665
red box.

41:39.233 --> 41:40.468
Yep.

41:40.801 --> 41:42.837
Daddy is going to
pick up a little flick and

41:42.970 --> 41:46.874
then he's going to
give you a little di-

41:51.712 --> 41:54.882
Hey, let me let me
call you back.

43:42.056 --> 43:43.491
Hello.

43:44.125 --> 43:49.296
- Kritika Express, I need a signature here!
-  In the back!

43:49.430 --> 43:53.667
We're uh, we're advised
not to do that, Sir.

43:54.603 --> 43:58.272
I just need a signature
and I'll be on my way.

43:58.405 --> 44:00.641
Try and find me.

44:05.379 --> 44:06.780
OK...

44:41.849 --> 44:43.150
Hello.

44:46.621 --> 44:48.222
Sir.

44:53.628 --> 44:55.062
Wow.

44:56.430 --> 44:57.798
Yep.

44:59.934 --> 45:02.203
Just need a signature
here on the package

45:02.336 --> 45:05.306
and I'll be on my way so...
- We don't have much time,

45:05.439 --> 45:07.208
so I'll brass tacks it.

45:07.341 --> 45:09.410
Probably wondering why
you're holding a package

45:09.544 --> 45:13.047
addressed to here,
but with your name on it.

45:13.180 --> 45:15.149
Yeah.

45:15.684 --> 45:17.184
Coincidence?

45:17.686 --> 45:19.153
How did you know that's my name?

45:19.286 --> 45:23.257
Look in order to not disturb
the space time continuum,

45:23.390 --> 45:27.161
I need to be injected
with your...with our DNA.

45:27.294 --> 45:30.665
Otherwise the chance
the whole process fails,

45:30.798 --> 45:32.399
and then we're fucked.

45:32.534 --> 45:34.603
What are you talking
about talking about?

45:34.735 --> 45:40.374
I'm talking about the end
la fin, vamoose, extinction

45:40.508 --> 45:42.109
in exactly 92 minutes

45:42.243 --> 45:44.546
and 46 seconds an asteroid
is going to come down-

45:44.679 --> 45:45.879
Oh, I get it.

45:46.013 --> 45:49.750
You're one of these crazy
desert guys, huh?

45:49.883 --> 45:52.319
You talk to lizards and,

45:52.520 --> 45:53.921
hang out in the sun.

45:54.054 --> 45:56.090
- I don't have time
to small talk with details.

45:56.223 --> 45:58.593
I'm you from the future
and you're me from the past.

45:58.727 --> 46:04.666
And the only way to stop this
thing is if you blast me with
your DNA.

46:08.603 --> 46:12.072
What?
- Oh come on, you think
it's funny?

46:12.206 --> 46:17.077
Well, it won't be so funny
when we're tiny bits of ash.

46:17.211 --> 46:19.847
All right, let's let's play,
pretend and say I believe you,

46:19.980 --> 46:22.584
which I absolutely do not.

46:22.717 --> 46:24.952
You expect me to do what just,

46:25.085 --> 46:28.422
pull my hair out
and give it to you.

46:30.257 --> 46:34.295
It's going to take more
than that, buddy.

46:36.330 --> 46:37.865
Saliva.

46:38.633 --> 46:40.100
Close.

46:44.271 --> 46:45.439
Blood.

46:45.573 --> 46:47.308
- Ooh, gross...

46:47.776 --> 46:49.577
But warmer.

46:53.113 --> 46:54.749
I think you just,

46:55.215 --> 46:57.418
need the sign for
the package sir.

46:57.552 --> 47:01.255
Well unfortunately I
can't do that.

47:01.723 --> 47:04.892
Until you do what's necessary.

47:07.995 --> 47:09.463
Well...

47:09.597 --> 47:12.099
Kritika's policy you can just
pick it up at the office.

47:12.232 --> 47:13.233
- Mmhmm.

47:20.441 --> 47:23.043
I ain't happy about it
either, kid,

47:23.177 --> 47:28.516
but it's the only way to ensure
the survival of mankind.

47:41.362 --> 47:45.499
Sorry,
the number you have dialed is
not in service at this time.

47:45.633 --> 47:47.401
Not one fucking bar.

47:51.573 --> 47:54.576
I'm you from the future.
You're me from the past.

47:59.046 --> 48:02.449
You're gonna be okay.

48:03.083 --> 48:05.152
This...

48:07.121 --> 48:09.022
Come on, come on.

48:11.392 --> 48:14.161
It's unbelievable.
- Well, if that ain't fate.

48:14.294 --> 48:16.598
I don't know what to tell you.

48:16.731 --> 48:17.665
Well it's not.

48:17.799 --> 48:19.634
It's not fate, it's illegal,

48:19.768 --> 48:22.837
you're kind of holding me
captive here so...

48:22.970 --> 48:24.672
You think it was me.

48:25.272 --> 48:28.610
I've been here with you
the whole time.

48:28.743 --> 48:30.277
Relax man.

48:31.078 --> 48:32.614
You hungry?

48:33.515 --> 48:34.582
No.

48:34.948 --> 48:36.885
How about a cold one?

48:37.017 --> 48:38.553
- No, I'm good.

49:00.675 --> 49:03.845
So what do you suggest
that I do?

49:04.178 --> 49:05.847
I told you, man.

49:06.581 --> 49:08.148
Look, I know it's a lot
to take in,

49:08.282 --> 49:09.551
but with all due respect,

49:09.684 --> 49:11.185
I'm the one that's going
to have to take it.

49:11.318 --> 49:13.287
I'm not gonna fuck
you, man. This is insane.

49:13.420 --> 49:15.255
Well unfortunately fucking me

49:15.389 --> 49:17.759
is the only way
you're getting out of here.

49:17.892 --> 49:22.597
And if you don't,
you ain't going to have much
time to do anything.

49:22.730 --> 49:25.265
Oh yeah, it's the only way I'm
getting out of here.
Well watch this.

49:25.399 --> 49:31.438
- Oh well you know it's a long
walk from here what you plan
on hitchhiking, ha!

49:31.573 --> 49:32.907
Good luck.

49:33.641 --> 49:36.711
This guy is fucking insane.

49:36.845 --> 49:38.613
He's a desert rat.

49:39.079 --> 49:43.217
That's all he is
just a fucking desert rat.

49:43.651 --> 49:45.319
Full of shit.

49:46.987 --> 49:51.626
His voice is fucking 2...3
octaves higher than mine.

49:57.998 --> 49:59.299
Hey look,

49:59.701 --> 50:02.804
I know that seeing yourself
living in shit like this

50:02.937 --> 50:07.074
isn't the picturesque life
you imagine for yourself.

50:07.207 --> 50:09.878
But you know its got
its perks, you know.

50:10.010 --> 50:12.012
You live a very full life.

50:12.145 --> 50:18.586
Sure, there's that little black
tar heroin phase that eventually
leads to most,

50:18.720 --> 50:21.255
if not all, friends and family
cutting you out completely.

50:21.388 --> 50:25.927
But you know, that's what 25
years of delivering packages
does to a man.

50:26.059 --> 50:28.730
Can you just please shut up?

50:29.129 --> 50:30.264
Please.
- Sure.

50:30.397 --> 50:33.535
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sure, no worries

50:33.668 --> 50:36.804
Hey, you know we got
a birthday coming up.

50:36.938 --> 50:38.706
That's exciting.

50:41.441 --> 50:44.712
How did you know that?
- I got a bottle of the good
stuff in the Dome.

50:44.846 --> 50:48.048
We could, maybe do this
thing black out.

50:48.181 --> 50:49.717
- Nah I'm good man.

50:49.851 --> 50:51.753
I don't know how else
to tell you that.
- Okay, alright.

50:51.886 --> 50:52.921
All right.

50:53.086 --> 50:54.354
Hey look

50:54.722 --> 50:59.459
why don't we like I don't know
ease into this thing.

51:00.460 --> 51:04.933
I could start like nibbling
at your neck, or something
like that.

51:05.065 --> 51:06.266
- Stop please.

51:06.500 --> 51:08.368
You're so fucking weird.

51:08.502 --> 51:11.005
Are you not reading
my body language at like...

51:11.138 --> 51:12.674
Can you just shut
the fuck up please?

51:12.807 --> 51:14.308
OK I got it.

51:15.108 --> 51:18.245
Why don't we go inside?
It's kind of cold out here.

51:18.378 --> 51:20.815
I promise I ain't gonna
do anything weird.

51:20.949 --> 51:23.651
Absolutely nothing weird.

51:25.920 --> 51:27.589
Scouts honor.

51:31.325 --> 51:34.596
Come on, it's cold out here.

51:39.567 --> 51:43.037
You know how I know
you're not me?

51:43.170 --> 51:44.706
Your TV sucks.

51:45.773 --> 51:46.874
- Hmm.

51:47.441 --> 51:50.778
This do anything for
your big boy.

51:52.013 --> 51:54.348
Your...your nipples?

51:55.049 --> 51:56.751
No makes me feel,

51:57.652 --> 52:03.190
Pretty uncomfortable.
- Don't knock-'em
till you try-'em.

52:03.323 --> 52:06.628
I got a girl with perfect
nipples.

52:07.528 --> 52:09.697
Waiting for me at home

52:09.831 --> 52:11.599
in a nice bed with,

52:12.466 --> 52:13.467
clean sheets.

52:13.601 --> 52:15.469
They're not always clean.

52:15.603 --> 52:18.271
What is that supposed
to mean?

52:18.405 --> 52:21.609
Let's face it, you ain't
Brad Pitt.

52:22.543 --> 52:24.078
She's a hot club girl.

52:24.211 --> 52:25.780
Tons of options.

52:26.814 --> 52:30.118
And that Armenian DJ that's
always hanging around.

52:32.587 --> 52:34.822
He's a friend.
- Oh wake up man.

52:34.956 --> 52:38.926
Who's in your Christmas
card last year?

52:39.694 --> 52:43.898
So she's she's cheating on me
now. Is that what you're saying?

52:45.933 --> 52:49.871
Why am I watching a children's
show with a dirty bum,
in a dome.

52:50.004 --> 52:52.507
What am I even doing here.

52:54.341 --> 52:56.209
Yep, I'm leaving can't do it.

52:56.343 --> 52:59.547
There he goes again, wait!

53:01.181 --> 53:03.785
- What.
- Open the package.

53:04.418 --> 53:08.355
- What?
- The package you brought,
open it.

53:08.790 --> 53:11.859
You need to see
what's inside.

54:05.479 --> 54:07.414
There's no way.

54:11.384 --> 54:13.286
There's no way.

54:14.989 --> 54:16.758
Go fuck yourself.

54:21.529 --> 54:23.497
Go fuck yourself.

54:28.401 --> 54:30.370
Go fuck yourself.

54:45.452 --> 54:50.091
<i>I'm you from the future</i>
<i>and you're me from the past.</i>

54:50.224 --> 54:55.328
<i>I'm not gonna fuck you</i>
<i>man. This is insane.</i>

54:57.198 --> 54:59.100
<i>Well, unfortunately fucking me</i>

54:59.233 --> 55:01.501
<i>is the only way</i>
<i>you're getting out of here.</i>

55:01.636 --> 55:07.575
<i>And if you don't,</i>
<i>you're not going to have much</i>
<i>time to do anything.</i>

55:19.020 --> 55:20.721
Hey.

55:22.290 --> 55:23.724
Hey yourself.

55:29.664 --> 55:31.498
What are we doing?

55:32.399 --> 55:33.868
This is nuts.

55:35.169 --> 55:38.338
We're doing what's necessary.

55:50.685 --> 55:54.387
Let's bring this thing
home, brother.

55:56.123 --> 55:57.390
Oh.

56:31.993 --> 56:33.160
1.

56:33.393 --> 56:34.695
2.

56:35.129 --> 56:36.264
3.

56:40.400 --> 56:41.602
Fuck yes!

56:41.969 --> 56:43.070
Fuck yes.

57:10.064 --> 57:12.767
Meat lovers.

57:51.238 --> 57:53.473
Wild Bills!

57:56.610 --> 57:58.179
Pizza!

58:10.291 --> 58:11.892
Another day.

58:12.226 --> 58:14.228
Another cream pie.

58:25.973 --> 58:29.610
Let's make this more
interesting.

58:29.977 --> 58:31.612
Yeah.

58:53.467 --> 58:54.869
Wow.

58:56.537 --> 58:57.905
Yep.

59:36.877 --> 59:38.913
Let's change subjects.

59:39.046 --> 59:40.748
This one starts on
the other side of town

59:40.881 --> 59:43.684
with a group of poker
playing mobsters.

59:43.818 --> 59:47.621
Set up you've seen
1000 times before.

59:48.189 --> 59:49.757
Only this.

59:49.890 --> 59:51.258
Has a twist.

1:00:06.841 --> 1:00:09.777
Oh, oh, oh I got one,
I got a good one.

1:00:09.910 --> 1:00:12.179
Why do Italian men grow
mustaches?

1:00:12.313 --> 1:00:13.347
Uh.

1:00:14.281 --> 1:00:15.850
So they could look
like their mother!

1:00:20.221 --> 1:00:23.290
- Their mother!
Their mother!

1:00:24.458 --> 1:00:26.327
Hey! You know, Tony.

1:00:29.531 --> 1:00:31.265
I mean, I'd fuck your mother!

1:00:48.550 --> 1:00:51.152
You want to fuck my mother?

1:00:54.388 --> 1:00:56.924
- Tony it's just joke.

1:00:57.592 --> 1:01:01.362
- Yeah, it's a goof.

1:01:13.274 --> 1:01:14.675
You son of a bitch,
you just see your face.

1:01:14.808 --> 1:01:15.843
I got you.

1:01:29.890 --> 1:01:32.326
Oh my God, Tony!

1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:34.028
Yeah man.

1:01:34.428 --> 1:01:36.397
Nearly shit myself.

1:01:36.598 --> 1:01:38.299
Almost shit my fucking pants.

1:01:39.967 --> 1:01:41.368
Oh my God Tony.

1:01:41.969 --> 1:01:45.372
Coulda given me a heart attack!

1:01:45.507 --> 1:01:46.675
Holy shit.

1:01:46.807 --> 1:01:47.841
Whoo.

1:01:58.852 --> 1:02:00.522
What the fuck!?

1:02:00.655 --> 1:02:02.356
You little shit.

1:02:20.975 --> 1:02:22.810
What are you guys doing?!

1:02:24.579 --> 1:02:26.715
Get in there.

1:02:26.847 --> 1:02:27.781
Come on, get in.

1:02:51.839 --> 1:02:53.173
Oh.

1:02:56.143 --> 1:02:57.579
Hey!

1:02:57.811 --> 1:02:59.046
Hey guys!

1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:00.515
Tony!

1:03:01.882 --> 1:03:03.117
Tony!

1:03:24.405 --> 1:03:27.374
Get up, let's go.

1:03:32.547 --> 1:03:33.581
Get up.

1:03:37.151 --> 1:03:39.053
Hey!

1:03:39.386 --> 1:03:41.188
Carmine.

1:03:41.989 --> 1:03:43.390
How you doing?

1:03:43.692 --> 1:03:45.426
Hey Carmine.

1:03:45.560 --> 1:03:49.463
How you feeling you doing OK?
- Guys a...

1:03:49.597 --> 1:03:51.165
Fucking legend.

1:03:52.333 --> 1:03:56.203
She giving you a grape juice
every day?

1:03:57.371 --> 1:04:01.375
Drinks more juice than
Sammy fucking Sosa.

1:04:01.509 --> 1:04:05.379
Hey ma, you remember Tutti,
don't you?

1:04:05.747 --> 1:04:06.847
Yeah.

1:04:07.214 --> 1:04:09.183
Hi boys, Tutti.

1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:13.987
Are you staying out of trouble?

1:04:14.121 --> 1:04:15.456
Wish we were.

1:04:15.590 --> 1:04:17.891
Actually Tutti he said he
wanted to fuck you Ma.

1:04:18.025 --> 1:04:20.094
Ain't that right?
Tell her.

1:04:20.227 --> 1:04:23.397
- Tony come on this is
real fucked up.

1:04:23.531 --> 1:04:27.301
I'm going to get-
- You ain't going nowhere.

1:04:27.434 --> 1:04:30.070
Is that right Tutti?

1:04:30.204 --> 1:04:32.940
You wanna pound me Tutti?

I mean, obviously
there's nothing wrong with that,

1:06:30.290 --> 1:06:33.761
but give a girl a heads up
like tell me, your tell me
you're blind.

1:06:33.895 --> 1:06:35.996
Could have shot you a text
or something right?

1:06:36.129 --> 1:06:37.799

- Yeah or...

1:06:38.065 --> 1:06:40.902
He couldn't. I don't know

1:06:41.034 --> 1:06:42.469
God, I don't know.

1:06:42.604 --> 1:06:45.372
I've never thought of that.
- No idea how that works.

1:06:45.507 --> 1:06:49.176
Guess I'll never find out

1:07:15.537 --> 1:07:18.438
Don't draw attention to it.

1:07:22.342 --> 1:07:24.044
Oh well, that'll put
hair on your chest.

1:07:24.177 --> 1:07:26.548

1:07:27.749 --> 1:07:28.616
Aww...

1:07:47.035 --> 1:07:48.736
No actual ashes.

1:07:50.404 --> 1:07:52.941
I got-'em  from the crematorium.

1:07:53.073 --> 1:07:56.276
On Saint Clair Street.

1:07:56.410 --> 1:07:57.712
- Oh it's nothing.

1:07:57.845 --> 1:07:59.547
It's just that you snorted
my dad's ashes.

1:07:59.681 --> 1:08:01.148
That's not nothing, sweetheart,

1:08:01.281 --> 1:08:03.618

1:08:06.621 --> 1:08:09.724
I'm so glad.

1:08:09.857 --> 1:08:11.325
It sucks.

1:08:11.793 --> 1:08:13.393
