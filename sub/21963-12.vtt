00:01.335 --> 00:03.304
You're teaming up
with the guys from Ghosted.

00:03.337 --> 00:05.039
I could have died
in there!

00:05.073 --> 00:06.974
Aw, somebody
need a hug?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.642
Catch all-new episodes Sundays.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.244
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.278 --> 00:13.081
The Orville, Gotham,
and Lucifer.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.548
Remember me?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.589
BARRY:
No, no.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.857
Found the end of the line
on those shell corporations.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.726
One of them has a P.O. box.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.695
Those look like
stakeout PB and Js.

00:27.728 --> 00:28.829
Is that the right box?

00:28.862 --> 00:29.930
MAX:
Yeah, that's our guy.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.265
-Drone!

00:34.768 --> 00:36.770
*

00:38.939 --> 00:41.109
Mm-hmm.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.511
The wire passed through here.

00:43.544 --> 00:46.046
I can sense it.

00:46.080 --> 00:50.384
I'm also getting
a very strong sense of grain.

00:50.418 --> 00:53.053
Grain, grain. That's great.
Hey, Celeste, do...

00:58.792 --> 01:00.961
Hey, when your psychic friend
is done here,

01:00.994 --> 01:03.264
do you think she could help me
find the thermostat?

01:03.297 --> 01:04.965
I've been cold since,
like, October.

01:04.998 --> 01:07.535
I know it seems silly,

01:07.568 --> 01:10.037
but we used Celeste a few times
back at the LAPD.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.640
She once found
a five-year-old girl hiding

01:12.673 --> 01:15.409
in a storage closet
in a condominium sales office.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.411
Her only clue
was a dirty mitten.

01:17.445 --> 01:20.981
I don't know.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.984
Are you still at it, Elvira?

01:24.017 --> 01:26.287
Don't give him my
bank account numbers, okay?

01:26.320 --> 01:28.489
And, uh, if you can
talk to people in hell,

01:28.522 --> 01:30.258
would you say hi to my dad?

01:30.291 --> 01:33.561
You know, I'm thinking
about bringing in a guy tomorrow

01:33.594 --> 01:35.563
who makes balloon animals.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.098
Yeah, maybe he can help you
find your dignity.

01:38.132 --> 01:40.734
CELESTE: I'm getting something.
I'm-I'm getting...

01:40.768 --> 01:44.004
They're telling me, "Isabelle."

01:44.037 --> 01:48.242
It's a book
with a character Isabelle.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.010
No.

01:50.043 --> 01:52.313
Author?

01:52.346 --> 01:55.015
-Mm. It's not clear.

01:55.048 --> 01:57.685
What about that missing child
thing that you've done?

01:57.718 --> 02:00.488
Can you just pretend that
the guys that bugged our office

02:00.521 --> 02:03.123
are missing children?
Maybe that would work.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.992
Is there anything,
anything else you're sensing?

02:05.025 --> 02:07.695
Well, I kept smelling green.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.530
MAX:
See, that's interesting

02:09.563 --> 02:12.166
because green is a color,
not an odor.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.302
I should go.

02:14.335 --> 02:17.137
Uh, let me see you out.

02:17.171 --> 02:20.674
Celeste, let us know if you have
any luck finding Truman's cat.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.676
You know, if you sense
any ghost kitties

02:22.710 --> 02:24.912
haunting mice in the West Wing.

02:31.385 --> 02:35.055
Um, I don't suppose
you could sign this?

02:35.088 --> 02:36.924
It would be my pleasure.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.532
Oh.

02:44.565 --> 02:47.167
Hey, what were you
talking about, Truman's cat?

02:47.201 --> 02:49.069
What, you don't know
about the cat?

02:49.102 --> 02:50.704
You people don't know
about the cat?

02:50.738 --> 02:52.806
-It's a great story.
-LaFREY: Let it go, Merv.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.508
It's bad for morale.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.043
No, no. I think
they deserve to know

02:56.076 --> 02:57.478
how their agency was created.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.380
So, President Harry Truman,

02:59.413 --> 03:01.515
he had an American Shorthair
named Lamar.

03:01.549 --> 03:06.019
Okay, one night in 1947,
Lamar disappeared from his bed.

03:06.053 --> 03:09.490
So, Truman thought
the cat was invisible.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.825
Oh, good God,
you're butchering the story.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.027
-Okay, so Truman wanted the FBI

03:14.061 --> 03:17.030
to investigate the case
of the invisible cat.

03:17.064 --> 03:19.066
They didn't want to. They formed
the Bureau Underground.

03:19.099 --> 03:21.235
70 years later, still no cat.

03:21.269 --> 03:24.071
And here we are,
working for Merv.

03:24.104 --> 03:28.242
Well, thank you, Ava.
That was inspired storytelling.

03:28.276 --> 03:29.877
You should do The Moth.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.912
-Thank you.
-ANNIE: Celeste just told me

03:31.945 --> 03:33.247
that the cat's in the dumbwaiter

03:33.281 --> 03:35.048
in the West Wing
of the White House.

03:35.082 --> 03:37.451
BARRY: Ooh, it's not too late
to say a few words.

03:37.485 --> 03:40.053
For many, Lamar was seen
as an introvert...

03:40.087 --> 03:41.422
I'll call the White House.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.623
Wait, you're actually calling
the White House?

03:42.656 --> 03:43.691
Yes, I am.

03:43.724 --> 03:47.127
She also said something else...

03:47.160 --> 03:49.397
but I don't know
if I should say.

03:49.430 --> 03:52.533
Ah, don't be that person who
says, "Oh, I know this thing,"

03:52.566 --> 03:54.768
and then don't say the thing.
Nobody likes that person.

03:54.802 --> 03:57.271
-Yeah, tell us
what the freaky lady said.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.539
-Come on.
-BARRY: Come on, come on.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.140
MAX:
Come on, tell us, tell us.

04:00.173 --> 04:02.376
Okay! Okay.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.778
She said...

04:04.812 --> 04:08.048
that tonight one of us
is gonna die on the way home.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.985
-Right.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.154
Sounds like the kind of thing
you should've kept to yourself.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.489
Guys, we should
totally trust her.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.057
She smells colors.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.059
-I hope she dies.
-DAVEY: I hope it's me.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.628
Yeah, it's silly.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.430
I'm-I'm sorry that
I even said anything.

04:22.463 --> 04:25.566
She is just a lame,
cash-grabbing psychic.

04:25.599 --> 04:30.304
So let's just pretend
that I never said anything.

04:30.338 --> 04:33.240
Yeah, in the dumbwaiter shaft,
yeah.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.443
Looking for a cat skeleton.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.812
I'll keep holding.

04:38.846 --> 04:41.749
-No.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.352
MAX:
It says here, "To Annie,

04:44.385 --> 04:46.820
may the spirit guide you.
Celeste."

04:46.854 --> 04:49.089
-Okay, fine. I enjoy her.
-Hmm.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.625
-I find her entertaining.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.293
:
No. Not really.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.829
I mean...

04:55.863 --> 04:57.264
Maybe a little.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.133
-Mm-hmm.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.935
There isn't
a teensy, tiny part of you

05:01.969 --> 05:04.304
that thinks maybe she's right?

05:04.338 --> 05:06.206
Well, Annie, there is
a chapter here called,

05:06.239 --> 05:09.543
"Science versus
What I Know Is True," so...

05:09.577 --> 05:11.945
You know, she told me
something about you.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.715
No, no, no, see,
I know what you're doing here.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.817
You're trying
to get me interested

05:16.850 --> 05:18.819
in Celeste's bullcrap,

05:18.852 --> 05:20.854
like someone's gonna die
on the way home

05:20.888 --> 05:22.990
or dead cats in the White House.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.493
-It was pretty juicy.
-I don't care. I really don't.

05:25.526 --> 05:28.662
You know what? I want you
to never tell me what she said.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.864
That's how much I don't care.
I don't care.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.535
LaFREY:
Guys, they found a cat skeleton

05:34.568 --> 05:36.870
in the dumbwaiter
in the West Wing.

05:36.904 --> 05:40.574
They also found a collar
next to it with the name

05:40.608 --> 05:43.411
-"Lama" on it.

05:43.444 --> 05:46.246
Yes, but there was a space
after the last "A"

05:46.279 --> 05:48.416
where the "R" could have been.

05:48.449 --> 05:49.917
-Lamar.
-LaFREY: That's right.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.719
That's right.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.194
Oh, come on, you guys.
Really?

06:01.228 --> 06:04.432
The fact that Celeste
found a cat skeleton

06:04.465 --> 06:07.401
does not mean one of us
is going to die tonight.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.336
I bet half her business
is finding cat skeletons.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.904
And I bet half of that half

06:10.938 --> 06:12.673
is probably dead cats
in dumbwaiters.

06:12.706 --> 06:16.444
I mean, dumbwaiters are
cat flatteners, you guys.

06:16.477 --> 06:19.079
She is not a wizard.
Leroy, am I right?

06:19.112 --> 06:21.014
Right. She's not a wizard.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.583
BARRY:
I'm with Max.

06:22.616 --> 06:25.686
She is no wizard.
But might she be a witch?

06:25.719 --> 06:26.887
DAVEY:
I'm supposed to go

06:26.920 --> 06:28.288
to my daughter's
birthday party tonight.

06:28.321 --> 06:30.424
Yeah, okay,
and you still can, Davey.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.726
You can go.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.899
So, I've been thinking,
and, should I pass in the night,

06:38.932 --> 06:40.901
I think it's important you know

06:40.934 --> 06:42.870
that I tried to sleep
with your boyfriend.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.939
Now, in my defense,
you were new here.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.709
Hey, that was some talk
with Celeste, huh?

06:48.742 --> 06:51.211
-Yeah.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.446
She say anything else?

06:52.480 --> 06:54.682
-That's all I remember.
-Think!

06:56.450 --> 06:59.086
She's usually way more
specific, you know.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.555
Leroy, the only thing
that she said was one of you

07:01.589 --> 07:03.457
was gonna die tonight
on the way home.

07:03.491 --> 07:05.392
How?
-No.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.060
-No. No.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.395
-No.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.597
Were they driving?

07:09.630 --> 07:12.099
-Were their hands,
like, ten and two?
-No.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.834
-No. No.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.636
12 and six?
-No.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.338
Leroy, I've told you
everything that I know.

07:22.776 --> 07:26.113
Don't put any stock into this.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.450
So I have pulled books
either written by an Isabelle

07:30.484 --> 07:32.786
or with the name Isabelle
in the title.

07:32.820 --> 07:36.156
Using "grain" and "green,"

07:36.189 --> 07:40.293
I have determined that we are
looking for a crop field...

07:40.327 --> 07:41.829
You do realize
this is a wild goose chase,

07:41.862 --> 07:43.764
and we have no idea
if any of this is meaningful?

07:43.797 --> 07:47.868
Yes, I know, Max,
but if I'm not kept busy,

07:47.901 --> 07:50.470
then my mind begins to wander

07:50.504 --> 07:53.974
to the time when Larry told me
he was moving in with Jocelyn.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.709
We were at this
Italian restaurant,

07:55.743 --> 07:57.210
and he just put some cash

07:57.244 --> 07:59.847
down on the table
and walked out.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.683
And then both of
our meals arrive,

08:02.716 --> 08:06.019
and I start mixing
things up together,

08:06.053 --> 08:08.221
like some kind of food family,

08:08.255 --> 08:11.859
trying to, you know,
make a family out of that food,

08:11.892 --> 08:15.563
and then I couldn't,
I just couldn't stop eating.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.865
I just kept eating
and eating, and then,

08:17.898 --> 08:21.401
outside, I threw up on the shoes

08:21.434 --> 08:24.471
of the guy who invented
the sideways moving car.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.273
Now...

08:28.275 --> 08:30.477
Okay, so you...
keep working on that.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.813
Sounds like you're, uh...
you're really onto something.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.648
Right, Leroy?

08:36.884 --> 08:38.852
-The, uh...
-Oh. I'm sorry, I was just

08:38.886 --> 08:41.354
thinking about how I've never
made my own pizza dough.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.023
-Not once.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.158
Why'd I even buy the stone?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.382
Everyone.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.601
Really?
You're not going home?

10:03.871 --> 10:05.305
What about your daughter's
birthday party?

10:05.338 --> 10:07.074
Eh...

10:07.107 --> 10:09.309
I'll send my twin brother.

10:09.342 --> 10:12.946
She likes him better anyway.
She calls him "Daddy good mood."

10:12.980 --> 10:14.281
Are any of you going home?

10:14.314 --> 10:15.515
-Yeah.

10:15.548 --> 10:16.917
Barry?

10:16.950 --> 10:18.786
Yes, yes,
I'm-I'm gonna g-go home,

10:18.819 --> 10:20.688
just not this exact moment.

10:20.721 --> 10:24.958
If you're so confident,
why aren't you going home?

10:24.992 --> 10:27.661
You know what,
that's a great idea.

10:27.695 --> 10:31.198
Leroy, let's go.

10:31.231 --> 10:34.267
-No...
-But you're my ride.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.703
Come on, man.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.939
Seriously?

10:38.972 --> 10:41.508
MERV:
Am I the first one out the door?

10:41.541 --> 10:43.977
Normally the clock strikes 5:00,

10:44.011 --> 10:46.379
and there's a stampede
for the parking lot.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.716
Merv. Are you really
gonna risk it?

10:48.749 --> 10:51.484
Um... yeah.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.486
Nighty-night.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.523
Oh, by the way, Merv,
we resolved the cat case.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.859
-Lamar's remains
have been found.

10:58.892 --> 11:01.628
Well, what do you know, you guys
actually solved something.

11:01.661 --> 11:05.098
I'll make sure
to let President Truman know.

11:07.067 --> 11:10.804
What's President Truman
gonna do with a dead cat?

11:10.838 --> 11:13.406
LEROY:
There he is.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.008
That's him turning
off our street.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.410
I'm gonna keep an eye on you.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.379
Annie, can you pull up
the satellite feed?

11:19.412 --> 11:20.848
Yeah.

11:20.881 --> 11:24.551
MAX:
Oh, my God, you guys,
what are you doing?

11:27.387 --> 11:29.556
He's swerving.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.591
He's having a stroke.

11:33.626 --> 11:36.563
He straightened out.
He's good. He's got it.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.069
Oh, he's having another stroke.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.079
Is that a truck?

11:53.713 --> 11:55.348
-No, no, no. Easy. Easy.
-Careful, Merv.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.451
-Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:00.053 --> 12:01.554
-Whoa!

12:10.263 --> 12:13.233
LEROY:
Well...

12:13.266 --> 12:14.968
he made it home.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.937
Oh, my God, you guys,
what a surprise.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.405
Merv didn't die.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.973
SASHA:
Yeah, Max is right.

12:20.007 --> 12:22.810
-KEN: Okay.

12:22.843 --> 12:25.212
LEROY:
Dude.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.713
You sure?

12:26.746 --> 12:28.748
No.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.664
I should've talked to him more.

12:44.697 --> 12:50.137
In the kitchen, he'd always
ask about my weekends.

12:50.170 --> 12:53.073
I never told him.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.208
I had some weekends
he would've loved.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.814
Oh, of course.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.349
Her-her, too.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.152
DAVEY:
So you want me to die,
is that it?

13:05.185 --> 13:07.454
You would rather
our daughter have a dead father

13:07.487 --> 13:08.856
than miss one lousy birthday?

13:08.889 --> 13:10.523
Am I getting that right,
Charlene?!

13:18.966 --> 13:20.567
She hung up.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.006
I'll show her.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.808
When I die, it'll ruin her life!

13:34.814 --> 13:37.450
Okay, bye.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.220
Well, that's another one
home safe.

13:45.592 --> 13:48.361
BARRY:
Ooh! If Celeste is right,

13:48.395 --> 13:49.796
with everyone
that gets home safely,

13:49.829 --> 13:53.533
the odds go up that
it's one of us who dies.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.468
That seems like
sound logic to me.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.804
Yeah. I'm gonna go.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.307
Yep.

14:00.340 --> 14:04.677
I believe in psychics,
but also reincarnation.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.880
Let's get this over with.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.682
Keep your eye out for a frog
with my personality, please.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.518
Weird frog with a beard.
Got it.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.520
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.223
You are now all leaving
because you believe?

14:16.256 --> 14:17.824
Is that right?

14:17.857 --> 14:20.894
Barry, what are you doing?
Don't do that.

14:20.928 --> 14:23.663
Look, either you're gonna die,
which won't happen,

14:23.696 --> 14:25.765
or you're gonna live,
and you're just gonna have to

14:25.798 --> 14:27.667
come back and bring
those plants back tomorrow.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.669
Look, just stop being
so bloody rational, Max!

14:29.702 --> 14:31.504
-It's so annoying!
Leave my plants!
-Okay. Just...

14:31.538 --> 14:33.840
-Leave my plants! Get off!
-Whoa, whoa!

14:33.873 --> 14:36.209
Oh, my God.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.578
-I love my plants, I love...

14:38.611 --> 14:40.413
LINDA:
Oh, you better not
be taking the stairs!

14:40.447 --> 14:42.015
See you in hell, Linda!

14:42.049 --> 14:43.583
I'll see you in hell!

14:48.455 --> 14:51.524
Good night, Max.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.927
Uh, good night.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.438
Okay, fine. You win.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.574
I want to know
what Celeste said about me.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.943
You told me never to tell you.

15:09.977 --> 15:13.981
Well, yeah... but...

15:14.014 --> 15:17.184
Good night.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.728
-That was a long hug.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.731
MAX:
Oh, my God.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.735
Leroy...

15:35.768 --> 15:37.337
-Nope.
-Come on, man!

15:37.370 --> 15:39.906
This is ridiculous!

15:39.939 --> 15:42.175
Everyone's gone.
We can be reasonable about this.

15:42.209 --> 15:45.245
Okay?
I want to go.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.779
There are other ways
to get home, you know.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.448
MAX:
Yeah, I know.

15:48.481 --> 15:51.284
I left my wallet at home and...

15:51.318 --> 15:53.420
Can't use Uber;
I have a one-star rating.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.988
No one will pick me up.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.489
How'd you get a one

15:56.523 --> 15:58.758
Well, I need to ride
in the front,

15:58.791 --> 16:01.528
and in certain
traffic situations,

16:01.561 --> 16:03.830
as you know, I need someone

16:03.863 --> 16:05.832
to sometimes hold my hand.
So what?

16:05.865 --> 16:08.535
-I'm staying.
-This is silly.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.170
-No, it's not silly.
-Yes.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.704
-It's normal, Max.
-Leroy...

16:11.738 --> 16:13.440
Max, you're not
superstitious, right?

16:13.473 --> 16:14.941
I don't see you
walking under ladders.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.609
Well, I would totally
walk under a ladder.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.045
-Yeah.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.679
If there was a ladder here
right now, you'd walk under it?

16:19.712 --> 16:22.182
-Yeah.
-Okay, tough guy.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.716
Are you gonna go get a ladder?

16:23.750 --> 16:26.386
Maybe you've never been
to the supply closet.

16:26.419 --> 16:29.289
I want to see Max Jennifer
tempt fate

16:29.322 --> 16:32.159
and walk under this ladder.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.563
I would love to.

16:36.596 --> 16:39.132
-Okay. Let's see.
-All right.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.134
-Be my guest.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.569
-Just under there. Yeah.

16:42.602 --> 16:43.970
Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.239
All right.
You asked for it.

16:46.273 --> 16:49.176
Oh, my God!

16:49.209 --> 16:50.810
Oh, I just walked
under a ladder.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.745
Oh, oh, oh, I'm doing it again.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.315
Oh, now I'm gonna go sideways.
What if I do that?

16:55.348 --> 16:57.184
Ladder walk, cha-cha-cha.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.719
Tempting fate, cha-cha-cha.
You know what?

16:59.752 --> 17:02.355
-Maybe I'll do it 13 times.
How about that?
-Max...

17:02.389 --> 17:03.990
-That's when it's gonna
get really good.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.025
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
!

17:14.567 --> 17:16.769
Is that ladder your best friend?

17:16.803 --> 17:18.705
LaFREY:
All right.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.441
Nope. I got two bottles
of Chablis waiting for me.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.743
That should be enough
to turn the lights off.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.278
Hey.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.517
Yeah. It's less than
half an hour.

17:30.550 --> 17:34.020
Well, normally,
I would say no...

17:34.053 --> 17:35.622
so that's what I'm gonna do now.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.657
Good night.

17:48.501 --> 17:52.139
Come on, Leroy.
It's time to go home.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.441
I'm not going.

17:56.443 --> 17:59.379
Okay. You know,
if you want to camp out

17:59.412 --> 18:02.915
in this cold office,
that's up to you.

18:02.949 --> 18:04.951
But I am out.

18:04.984 --> 18:08.054
There's a bus station
a few miles from here.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.089
Or maybe I can guess
the combination

18:10.123 --> 18:14.227
to Bird's recumbent
bike lock. Whoa.

18:14.261 --> 18:17.230
Maybe I was unclear.
You can't leave.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.832
Yes, I can.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.268
Obviously, I believe
in this stuff.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.770
So that means I also believe
if you go through that door,

18:23.803 --> 18:25.638
there's a strong chance
you'll die.

18:25.672 --> 18:28.608
I-I, honestly, I do not get it.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.110
Like, how can you believe
in a psychic premonition?

18:31.144 --> 18:33.180
You're the guy that doesn't
even believe in aliens.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.581
You're the guy that does
believe in aliens.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.150
Don't you see how
that's way weirder?

18:37.184 --> 18:39.286
I used to think
you were so smart.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.087
You probably don't even
believe in crystals.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.990
-Only the ones that work.

18:44.023 --> 18:45.425
Okay, do you believe
in palm reading?

18:45.458 --> 18:46.526
-No.

18:46.559 --> 18:47.960
-Of course not.

18:47.994 --> 18:49.529
-Obviously.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.831
No. But you asking me that,
a little bit racist.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.333
Do you think
if you step on a crack,

18:53.366 --> 18:54.867
you break your mother's back?

18:54.901 --> 18:57.437
I tested it, my mother was fine.
Now you're just insulting me.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.806
Do you believe in God?

19:02.342 --> 19:04.377
Also keeps the vampires away.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.646
Okay.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.181
Fair enough.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.916
Looks like, uh,
we're both stay...

19:11.083 --> 19:13.820
This is not chill, bro!

19:13.853 --> 19:15.988
I am a grown-up. So are you.

19:18.191 --> 19:19.826
LEROY:
Go limp. Go limp.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.961
You let everyone else leave.
Why not me?

19:21.994 --> 19:24.231
Just... because...

19:24.264 --> 19:26.065
Shut up!

19:30.102 --> 19:33.506
Okay. I'm-I'm limp. I'm limp.
I'll stay.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.442
-Yeah.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.983
I'm sorry I roughed you up.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.153
I'm sorry
I-I roughed you up, too,

19:47.186 --> 19:49.021
with-with my moves.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.964
*

20:06.739 --> 20:10.577
You skipped dinner.
-I'm good. I ate.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.845
All right.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.014
LEROY:
I'm having you over
this weekend.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.883
Gonna make you a pizza.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.285
-Yeah.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.887
-Yeah.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.456
-Never seen your place.
-I know.

20:23.490 --> 20:26.125
A very specific picture
in my mind

20:26.158 --> 20:29.562
of what Leroy's place
looks like.

20:29.596 --> 20:30.963
Paint that picture for me.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.866
Leather couch.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.067
Ding.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.103
-Not much else.
-Ding.

20:37.136 --> 20:39.606
All right.
-Yes, you are.

20:39.639 --> 20:41.541
Should warn you, I'm a snorer.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.343
LEROY:
Oh, you don't know snoring.

20:57.657 --> 21:00.327
CELESTE:
Very strong sense of grain.

21:03.296 --> 21:04.797
MAX:
How about following our leads?

21:04.831 --> 21:06.799
CELESTE:
Well, I kept smelling green.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.001
MERV: Yeah, maybe he can
help you find your dignity.

21:09.035 --> 21:12.271
CELESTE: It's a book
with a character Isabelle.

21:12.305 --> 21:14.006
Author?

21:18.311 --> 21:20.513
MAX:
Holy crap.

21:20.547 --> 21:22.749
I know who bugged our office.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.518
Leroy!
I know who bugged our office!

21:27.554 --> 21:29.789
It's all right.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.824
I'll tell you in the morning.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.863
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

21:39.466 --> 21:41.468
You've explored the paranormal
with Ghosted.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.903
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

21:45.237 --> 21:46.539
Are you ready?

21:48.307 --> 21:49.442
