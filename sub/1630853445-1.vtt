WEBVTT

01:43.440 --> 01:44.000
Don't you just love
these long rainy afternoons

01:44.000 --> 01:47.480
Don't you just love
these long rainy afternoons

01:47.520 --> 01:51.760
in New Orleans
when an hour isn't just an hour

01:51.800 --> 01:52.000
but a little piece of eternity
dropped into your hands

01:52.000 --> 01:55.200
but a little piece of eternity
dropped into your hands

01:55.240 --> 01:57.880
and who knows what to do with it?

01:57.920 --> 02:00.000
You, er, didn't get wet in the rain?

02:00.000 --> 02:00.800
You, er, didn't get wet in the rain?

02:00.840 --> 02:03.560
Perhaps you stepped
inside the drugstore.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.480
I just don't think
it's the kind of thing

02:05.520 --> 02:07.720
our children should be exposed to.

02:08.960 --> 02:12.000
As teachers we should protect
our children from many things.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.960
Great art isn't one of them.
Now sit down.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
You're embarrassing
your daughter. Come on.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.320
You're embarrassing
your daughter. Come on.

02:17.360 --> 02:19.640
Stella! Stella!

02:19.680 --> 02:23.160
She ain't coming down. So you quit.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.000
Stella!
I've been on to you from the start.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.400
Stella!
I've been on to you from the start.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.400
Not once did you pull
any wool over this boy's eyes.

02:29.440 --> 02:32.000
You come in here and sprinkle
the place with powder...

02:32.000 --> 02:32.600
You come in here and sprinkle
the place with powder...

02:32.640 --> 02:35.880
What you are talking
about is brutal desire.

02:35.920 --> 02:40.000
Just Desire. The name of
that rattle-trap streetcar

02:40.000 --> 02:40.040
Just Desire. The name of
that rattle-trap streetcar

02:40.080 --> 02:42.080
that bangs through the Quarter,

02:42.120 --> 02:44.760
up one old narrow
street and down another.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.080
We've seen quite enough.
Oh!

02:47.120 --> 02:48.000
How is it for you,
Mrs Griffiths, huh,

02:48.000 --> 02:49.680
How is it for you,
Mrs Griffiths, huh,

02:49.720 --> 02:51.960
living in blissful ignorance?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.600
Is it better or worse
than quiet desperation?

02:54.640 --> 02:56.000
I don't want realism. I want magic.
Goodnight, mother.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.040
I don't want realism. I want magic.
Goodnight, mother.

02:58.080 --> 03:01.600
Yes, magic.
I try to give that to people.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.640
Whoever you are,

03:03.680 --> 03:04.000
I have always depended
on the kindness of strangers.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.920
I have always depended
on the kindness of strangers.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.360
What was that for?

03:47.920 --> 03:50.160
I'm really nervous.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.000
Focus.

03:52.000 --> 03:52.200
Focus.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.240
Breathe.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.200
Mean what you say.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.160
Have you had enough now?
Come on then.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.000
The sets are looking lovely, David.

06:04.040 --> 06:06.080
Oh, thank you, Mrs Jones.
We're proud of those.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.000
And when you finally get around
to building my extension,

06:08.000 --> 06:09.480
And when you finally get around
to building my extension,

06:09.520 --> 06:11.920
I expect the same high standards.
Well, I'm not going to make

06:11.960 --> 06:15.560
any promises but, for you,
I'll try my very best. all right?

06:15.600 --> 06:16.000
You must be so busy, Mayor Jenkins.
Ohhh!

06:16.000 --> 06:18.120
You must be so busy, Mayor Jenkins.
Ohhh!

06:18.160 --> 06:21.040
It's fantastic.
Fair play to you to take the time

06:21.080 --> 06:23.440
to come and encourage the children.

06:23.480 --> 06:24.000
Wasn't she the best thing in it?
Oh, definitely.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.600
Wasn't she the best thing in it?
Oh, definitely.

06:25.640 --> 06:30.600
You look dead on your feet. I am,
Mam. Oppressing people is hard work.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.000
We'll head home shortly.
Mm! Mm!-mm!

06:32.000 --> 06:32.760
We'll head home shortly.
Mm! Mm!-mm!

06:34.840 --> 06:38.200
Can we go home soon? Yes, I said
we will. OK. We'll go home shortly.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.680
Mr Morgan.
I'll see you again. Bye-bye now.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.880
Mr Morgan, did you enjoy the show?

06:45.920 --> 06:48.000
Oh, very much, yes. Who was the boy
who played Caiaphas the high priest?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.960
Oh, very much, yes. Who was the boy
who played Caiaphas the high priest?

06:50.000 --> 06:53.080
Oh, that's Nick.
He was a real handful

06:53.120 --> 06:56.000
when he first came to the club.
He's had a real tough time of it.

06:56.000 --> 06:56.320
when he first came to the club.
He's had a real tough time of it.

06:56.360 --> 06:59.680
You know, his dad,
he was in jail for burglary.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.600
Yeah.
And his mum likes her drink.

07:01.640 --> 07:03.840
But he never missed a rehearsal.

07:03.880 --> 07:04.000
I'm sure you'd have liked something
a bit grittier than Lloyd Webber.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.560
I'm sure you'd have liked something
a bit grittier than Lloyd Webber.

07:07.600 --> 07:11.680
I don't want realism. I want magic.

07:11.720 --> 07:12.000
Hm? I remember that line
from Streetcar. Yeah.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.440
Hm? I remember that line
from Streetcar. Yeah.

07:15.480 --> 07:18.240
I remember you putting
Vivien Leigh to shame. Stop it.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.000
Well...
You come for dinner one night.

07:20.000 --> 07:20.280
Well...
You come for dinner one night.

07:20.320 --> 07:23.240
I'd like that. Would you? Do you
know, I was watching the faces

07:23.280 --> 07:25.480
of the children when
they were performing.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.360
They were transported.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.000
Huh? They believe in magic.
It was fabulous, wasn't it?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.800
Huh? They believe in magic.
It was fabulous, wasn't it?

07:30.840 --> 07:33.240
Oh, here's David now.
Hiya, Mr Morgan. Are you all right?

07:33.280 --> 07:35.560
Yeah, grand.
I was just telling your wife,

07:35.600 --> 07:36.000
- she should be very proud of herself.
- Yeah.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.280
- she should be very proud of herself.
- Yeah.

07:38.320 --> 07:41.680
Anyway. I'll be off. See you both
soon, all right? Nos da. Nos da.

07:41.720 --> 07:44.000
I'll push off. I've got to be at
work in four hours. I know but...

07:44.000 --> 07:45.480
I'll push off. I've got to be at
work in four hours. I know but...

07:45.520 --> 07:47.280
Mark!

07:47.320 --> 07:50.280
Oh! Hi, Mr Morgan.
That was wonderful, wasn't it, eh?

07:50.320 --> 07:52.000
Oh, thank you. Did you enjoy it?
Oi! I enjoyed every... Jesus!

07:52.000 --> 07:53.400
Oh, thank you. Did you enjoy it?
Oi! I enjoyed every... Jesus!

07:53.440 --> 07:57.320
Oh! Your mam's calling you. All
right. Good to see you, Mr Morgan.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.360
Peace be with you.

08:00.520 --> 08:03.480
You can drop the
Stanislavski method now. Mm-hm!

08:03.520 --> 08:05.440
What are you drinking, Mam?
Can I have one?

08:05.480 --> 08:07.480
Nom you bloody well can't,
it's mine!

08:07.520 --> 08:08.000
I'm not being funny but you
nearly gave Lil a coronary.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.040
I'm not being funny but you
nearly gave Lil a coronary.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.720
What?
Well, in the interval,

08:13.760 --> 08:16.000
she saw Jesus with his tongue
down Mary Magdalene's throat

08:16.000 --> 08:16.920
she saw Jesus with his tongue
down Mary Magdalene's throat

08:16.960 --> 08:19.960
outside the Co-op. I doubt
she'll ever recover from that one.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.240
I wasn't... I wasn't.
It wasn't, Mam. Who was it then?

08:25.400 --> 08:27.400
It was Gwyneth Jones.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.240
Oh. That's all right then.

08:30.280 --> 08:32.000
But not in the Jesus costume, eh?

08:32.040 --> 08:34.560
All right, Mam.
I'll see you at home.

08:35.560 --> 08:37.040
Ta-ra!

08:48.360 --> 08:52.480
Do you know, I thought the kids
were brilliant last night.

08:52.520 --> 08:56.000
Oh, I know. So, what
are you going to put on next?

08:56.000 --> 08:56.880
Oh, I know. So, what
are you going to put on next?

08:56.920 --> 08:59.480
Give me a break.
I'm still knackered from this one.

08:59.520 --> 09:03.840
But I have been thinking,
you know, about challenging them

09:03.880 --> 09:04.000
just a little bit more.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.320
just a little bit more.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.240
Midsummer Night's Dream.

09:08.280 --> 09:11.280
Mm! Not that one. Way too scary.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.000
It's not scary.
It is when you watch it on acid.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.640
It's not scary.
It is when you watch it on acid.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.480
Found that out on a school trip.

09:16.520 --> 09:20.000
I thought it would be fun, instead
it scared the life out of me.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
I thought it would be fun, instead
it scared the life out of me.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.760
Since that day, I've never
watched Shakespeare again.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.760
Wouldn't it make more sense
to never do acid again?

09:26.800 --> 09:28.000
No. Oh!

09:28.000 --> 09:29.480
No. Oh!

09:31.280 --> 09:36.000
Carol. Just give it a trim. Nothing
fancy. I'll be back in an hour.

09:36.000 --> 09:36.520
Carol. Just give it a trim. Nothing
fancy. I'll be back in an hour.

09:37.720 --> 09:42.200
But... Take a seat, love. Don't
need to be scared. Go for it.

09:54.440 --> 09:58.640
So, what do you really want?

10:43.240 --> 10:46.040
You!

10:46.080 --> 10:48.000
Morning, Susan.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.640
Morning, Susan.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.680
Good morning, Mayor.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.720
Can I get a coffee, please?

11:11.480 --> 11:12.000
Hiya. That'll be £5,
please, Mrs Pritchard.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.720
Hiya. That'll be £5,
please, Mrs Pritchard.

11:48.320 --> 11:50.320
Cup of tea or coffee?

11:50.360 --> 11:52.000
I'm fine, thank you.

11:52.000 --> 11:52.360
I'm fine, thank you.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.600
Susan Leonard?

11:57.600 --> 12:00.000
We were at school together.
I was in the year below you.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.440
We were at school together.
I was in the year below you.

12:01.440 --> 12:03.440
I remember you were one
of the really clever ones.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.280
Didn't you go to Oxford?

12:05.320 --> 12:07.960
Cambridge, actually.

12:09.240 --> 12:12.200
I was completely useless at school.
Bottom of every class.

12:12.240 --> 12:16.000
It wasn't until I was 17, they
realised I was hopelessly dyslexic.

12:16.000 --> 12:16.200
It wasn't until I was 17, they
realised I was hopelessly dyslexic.

12:16.240 --> 12:19.480
So, you decided to become a postman?

12:22.520 --> 12:24.000
Odd choice I know.

12:24.000 --> 12:24.520
Odd choice I know.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.680
People still wonder how
Mrs Williams found out her husband

12:27.720 --> 12:29.720
was having an affair
with the next door neighbour.

12:29.760 --> 12:32.000
No.

12:32.000 --> 12:32.680
No.

12:32.720 --> 12:35.320
Didn't you get engaged
to David Llewellyn?

12:35.360 --> 12:37.360
I did, yes.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.000
I remember thinking he was a lovely
boy. Yeah, I thought so too.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.160
I remember thinking he was a lovely
boy. Yeah, I thought so too.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.480
Until I caught him shagging
my best friend from uni.

12:43.520 --> 12:47.080
Ready now.
Coming.

12:56.280 --> 13:00.600
Richard Goodridge.
Oh, Richard Goodridge!

13:00.640 --> 13:03.240
Hello, Mayor. Hey! Good to
have you with us. Thank you.

13:03.280 --> 13:04.000
I knew your father, of course.
I remember him telling me

13:04.000 --> 13:05.600
I knew your father, of course.
I remember him telling me

13:05.640 --> 13:07.920
you were studying Welsh history.
That's right, yes.

13:07.960 --> 13:11.560
For the last seven years now at the
Open University. This just came in.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.000
My plan is to become a teacher.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.600
My plan is to become a teacher.

13:15.640 --> 13:19.400
I almost had my qualification,
then, you know,

13:19.440 --> 13:20.000
my father had his heart attack.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.720
my father had his heart attack.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.720
Oh! Oh, yeah. It was
a terrible shock to all of us.

13:26.760 --> 13:28.000
Thank you.

13:28.000 --> 13:28.760
Thank you.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.800
He loved this town.

13:32.280 --> 13:34.280
Before he died,
he made me promise that

13:34.320 --> 13:36.000
I would finish off
his hard work he started

13:36.000 --> 13:36.360
I would finish off
his hard work he started

13:36.400 --> 13:38.880
setting up
an adult education centre.

13:38.920 --> 13:42.240
Oh! Emlyn had been
banging on about that for years.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.000
Said that in this changing world
people need the chance

13:44.000 --> 13:44.480
Said that in this changing world
people need the chance

13:44.520 --> 13:47.960
to retrain for new careers.
Absolutely, yeah.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.400
I have a couple...
Richard, Richard, Richard.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.000
Are you listening, son?

13:52.000 --> 13:52.440
Are you listening, son?

13:56.120 --> 13:59.640
The trick to getting things done
around here is to build alliances.

14:01.920 --> 14:06.080
Huh? Do you have any plans
for Saturday afternoon?

14:06.120 --> 14:07.960
Er, no plans, no.

14:08.160 --> 14:10.440
We're having a few people over
for drinks at the golf club.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.160
Very informal. Right. But all
the councillors will be there

14:13.200 --> 14:15.680
and you'll be able to
start to get them onside.

14:15.720 --> 14:16.000
Oh, lovely. Thank you.
I look forward to it.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.720
Oh, lovely. Thank you.
I look forward to it.

14:18.800 --> 14:22.360
Ahh! Martyn, sorry to keep you.
Yeah, how are you?

14:22.400 --> 14:24.000
Eh? I just walked in.

14:24.000 --> 14:24.400
Eh? I just walked in.

14:24.440 --> 14:27.640
Hey! Hey! Thanks for the gift.
Oh!

14:28.640 --> 14:32.000
Now, this is where I want to
build the new shopping centre.

14:32.000 --> 14:32.920
Now, this is where I want to
build the new shopping centre.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.960
Right.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.960
Next to the Lyric.
No.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
On the site of the Lyric,
after we demolish it.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.320
On the site of the Lyric,
after we demolish it.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.400
Er...

14:45.400 --> 14:47.400
..but the place is still
being used as a cinema.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.000
Yeah, showing films
nobody wants to see.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.520
Yeah, showing films
nobody wants to see.

14:52.040 --> 14:54.560
When was the last time you were
there? I saw the Youth Opera

14:54.600 --> 14:56.000
there last night with my daughter.

14:56.000 --> 14:56.880
there last night with my daughter.

14:56.920 --> 14:59.000
But their shows
are only every few months.

14:59.040 --> 15:01.920
You're right. I haven't
seen a film there in ages.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.000
Precisely.
They'll be bankrupt in a year.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.440
Precisely.
They'll be bankrupt in a year.

15:05.480 --> 15:09.240
Ha! And you will be stuck
with a ruin in the middle of town

15:09.280 --> 15:12.000
instead of a vibrant
commercial centre

15:12.000 --> 15:12.280
instead of a vibrant
commercial centre

15:12.320 --> 15:16.480
that will turn Carmarthen
into a destination location.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.000
And what's good for
Carmarthen is good for you.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.440
And what's good for
Carmarthen is good for you.

15:22.480 --> 15:27.960
If we can do this, your share
options will go through the roof.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.520
Hm!
You'll be able to retire early

15:30.560 --> 15:32.600
and live like a king.

15:32.640 --> 15:36.000
Yeah.

15:36.000 --> 15:36.200
Yeah.

15:40.360 --> 15:42.360
You do know it's a listed building.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.000
Well, you can fix that

15:44.000 --> 15:44.600
Well, you can fix that

15:44.640 --> 15:46.640
for a fee.

15:49.320 --> 15:51.880
Yeah. Yeah.

15:51.920 --> 15:52.000
The place is falling apart.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.920
The place is falling apart.

15:53.960 --> 15:57.160
It might even be
a danger to anyone inside.

15:57.200 --> 16:00.000
You're right. Ah, it's had its day.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.160
You're right. Ah, it's had its day.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.560
Yeah.

16:03.560 --> 16:08.000
So, you'll sort out the zoning
and planning permissions, hmm?

16:08.000 --> 16:08.480
So, you'll sort out the zoning
and planning permissions, hmm?

16:08.520 --> 16:11.040
Yeah.
I'll get out my chequebook.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.720
Yeah. Yeah.

16:33.200 --> 16:37.080
Morning, Dolly. I have to ask you
to keep your voice down, Liz.

16:37.120 --> 16:39.400
I'm hanging.

16:39.440 --> 16:40.000
Go and have a kip. You'll be fine.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.320
Go and have a kip. You'll be fine.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.360
You're a life saver. Thank you.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.000
Susan. Oh!

16:48.000 --> 16:49.360
Susan. Oh!

16:49.400 --> 16:52.440
It's been forever.
Oh, I know. I'm sorry.

16:52.480 --> 16:55.000
I'm in a bit of a rush. Could
you just do a quick trim? Yeah.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.000
Thank you. Your mam was
in last week. She's worried

16:56.000 --> 16:57.760
Thank you. Your mam was
in last week. She's worried

16:57.800 --> 16:59.800
you're going to move
to the other side of the world.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.640
I applied for a job in Cardiff.

17:01.680 --> 17:04.000
It's an hour away.
And I doubt I'll even get it.

17:04.000 --> 17:04.360
It's an hour away.
And I doubt I'll even get it.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.640
You know, I've always
wanted a career in politics.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.800
I thought being the mayor's
"executive assistant"

17:09.840 --> 17:12.000
would be a good first step. Turns
out our mayor thinks a woman,

17:12.000 --> 17:13.440
would be a good first step. Turns
out our mayor thinks a woman,

17:13.480 --> 17:15.560
even one with a law degree,
is only capable

17:15.600 --> 17:17.600
of filing and answering phones.

17:17.640 --> 17:19.840
Well, you know,
he always was a bit odd.

17:19.880 --> 17:20.000
That's because
he feels threatened by women.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.400
That's because
he feels threatened by women.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.840
Probably because he realises

17:24.880 --> 17:26.920
we should be the ones
running the world.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.000
We couldn't do a worse
job than them, could we? No!

17:28.000 --> 17:29.520
We couldn't do a worse
job than them, could we? No!

17:30.520 --> 17:32.920
Going anywhere special?
I wish.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.720
The mayor's invited me
to drinks at the golf club.

17:35.760 --> 17:36.000
I'm only going because
Ceri's my best friend.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.240
I'm only going because
Ceri's my best friend.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.080
God knows why she married him.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.760
Sorry. That was a bit harsh.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.000
But true.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.120
But true.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.000
Richard, you made it. Welcome.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.040
Richard, you made it. Welcome.

18:09.080 --> 18:11.440
Come here, come here, come here.
This is my wife Ceri.

18:11.480 --> 18:14.760
Ceri, this is Richard, the newest
addition to the town council.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.000
And our postman,
if I'm not mistaken.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.520
And our postman,
if I'm not mistaken.

18:17.560 --> 18:20.760
Thank you. Don't be soft. There's
a few people I want you to meet.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.120
Nearly all the other councillors
are here. Oh, from Alwyn.

18:23.160 --> 18:24.000
Hello. Nice. Nice. Come on.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.040
Hello. Nice. Nice. Come on.

18:26.080 --> 18:29.520
You know what I'm like about
religion. Give me your glass.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.800
The way her face lit up
on that Lyric stage,

18:31.840 --> 18:32.000
I bloody nearly converted
on the spot. This is Darek.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.440
I bloody nearly converted
on the spot. This is Darek.

18:34.480 --> 18:38.080
He's Carmarthen's answer to
Leon Trotsky, only more left wing.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.360
I want you to meet our newest
councillor, Richard Goodridge.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.200
How's it going?
All right.

18:45.240 --> 18:48.000
Oh! Emlyn's boy. Ah!
You knew my dad?

18:48.000 --> 18:49.080
Oh! Emlyn's boy. Ah!
You knew my dad?

18:49.120 --> 18:51.120
Aye, aye, aye.
He spoke about you often.

18:51.160 --> 18:55.000
Come on, you, let's go. Ha!
Right. Enjoy yourself.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.000
And on the nationalist end
of the spectrum, this is Aled.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.800
And on the nationalist end
of the spectrum, this is Aled.

18:58.840 --> 19:01.320
He's a firm advocate of
the watchtowers and razor wires

19:01.360 --> 19:03.240
along the border, aren't you, eh?

19:03.280 --> 19:04.000
Don't forget the machine guns.
I won't.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.440
Don't forget the machine guns.
I won't.

19:06.480 --> 19:10.640
Welcome to Carmarthen's
corridors of power.

19:10.680 --> 19:12.000
Ah!
(SPEAKS WELSH

19:12.000 --> 19:12.680
Ah!
(SPEAKS WELSH

19:12.720 --> 19:15.080
Thanks. Come on.
I want to introduce Richard

19:15.120 --> 19:17.560
to the councillors who
aren't on the lunatic fringe.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.000
Come on. I think the feeling
is he's insane. Yeah.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.200
Come on. I think the feeling
is he's insane. Yeah.

19:21.240 --> 19:24.800
I know, I know. Oh! Oh, my God!
I wasn't, er...

19:24.840 --> 19:28.000
- Yeah, you were. It's fine.
- Come on. Oh!

19:28.000 --> 19:28.400
- Yeah, you were. It's fine.
- Come on. Oh!

19:29.360 --> 19:33.840
Is she... single?
Yeah, I think so. OK.

19:33.880 --> 19:36.000
The last office Christmas
party, I had a few too many.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.240
The last office Christmas
party, I had a few too many.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.400
I had a crack but
she was having none of it.

19:39.440 --> 19:42.240
Huh!
So I think she might be a lesbian.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.000
Oh, God!

19:44.000 --> 19:44.440
Oh, God!

19:44.480 --> 19:46.480
Yeah.

19:46.520 --> 19:49.120
I'm gonna go talk
to a good friend of mine.

19:49.160 --> 19:51.680
Yeah. And you're going to help
yourself to some nibbles. You OK?

19:51.720 --> 19:52.000
Absolutely, yeah. Nice.
Thank you. All right.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.560
Absolutely, yeah. Nice.
Thank you. All right.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.480
Off you go.
Go on, go on, go on.

20:08.680 --> 20:11.520
You were all brilliant
in Jesus Christ Superstar.

20:11.560 --> 20:15.080
Anyone got any ideas
about what we put on next?

20:15.120 --> 20:16.000
Mam, you always do this.
You ask us to vote, then we vote,

20:16.000 --> 20:17.840
Mam, you always do this.
You ask us to vote, then we vote,

20:17.880 --> 20:20.800
then you overrule us, OK?
Stop pretending this is a democracy

20:20.840 --> 20:24.000
- because it's a dictatorship.
- I'm right.

20:24.000 --> 20:24.160
- because it's a dictatorship.
- I'm right.

20:24.200 --> 20:27.480
A benevolent dictatorship.
Mam, we don't care.

20:27.520 --> 20:30.360
We already know what we're
doing next, so just tell us.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.000
Yeah, tell us.
It's exciting this, isn't it?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.840
Yeah, tell us.
It's exciting this, isn't it?

20:35.920 --> 20:39.680
The next production that we're
going to put on at the Lyric

20:39.720 --> 20:40.000
is going to be...
Mam!

20:40.000 --> 20:43.680
is going to be...
Mam!

20:43.720 --> 20:46.960
..Oliver.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Auditions start on Monday.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.160
Auditions start on Monday.

20:49.200 --> 20:52.560
He's the swing vote on this.
I know. I've done the numbers.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.800
You'd better keep him close.
Did I leave my bag down here?

20:55.840 --> 20:56.000
Hiya.
Oh, hiya.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.760
Hiya.
Oh, hiya.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.240
Thank you.

21:01.280 --> 21:03.840
I love what you've
done with your hair. It...

21:03.880 --> 21:04.000
It looks gorgeous.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.880
It looks gorgeous.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.920
Thank you.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.880
Darek tells me you have got

21:09.920 --> 21:12.000
a master's in history
from the Open University.

21:12.000 --> 21:12.720
a master's in history
from the Open University.

21:12.760 --> 21:15.640
That's very impressive.
Well, thank you very much.

21:15.680 --> 21:20.000
Medieval is my real
passion. But I love it all really.

21:20.000 --> 21:20.200
Medieval is my real
passion. But I love it all really.

21:20.240 --> 21:24.560
Do you know...? Richard. Sorry.
Can I drag you away for a minute?

21:24.600 --> 21:26.600
I have to get going anyway.

21:26.640 --> 21:28.000
But, um, I'd love to hear
more about that at some point.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.960
But, um, I'd love to hear
more about that at some point.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.520
I just wanted
to go through the schedule

21:32.560 --> 21:35.320
for your first council meeting
on Monday. Now. we always start

21:35.360 --> 21:36.000
with the most boring stuff. Reading
the minutes of the last meeting,

21:36.000 --> 21:39.280
with the most boring stuff. Reading
the minutes of the last meeting,

21:39.320 --> 21:41.880
approving the accounts,
that kind of thing.

21:41.920 --> 21:44.000
How are you, sir?
Good.

21:44.000 --> 21:44.760
How are you, sir?
Good.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.600
I'm good. Quick, quick.
All the way down the end.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.640
Good. Thank you.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.680
Yes. Yeah.

21:51.720 --> 21:52.000
Morning, Mayor Jenkins. It's all
so tedious, nobody bothers to argue.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.680
Morning, Mayor Jenkins. It's all
so tedious, nobody bothers to argue.

21:55.720 --> 21:58.320
Then we move on to the reports
and the recommendations

21:58.360 --> 22:00.000
of various committees. This is
a little bit more interesting

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
of various committees. This is
a little bit more interesting

22:02.040 --> 22:05.520
but it can lead
to a lot of arguments. Hm!

22:05.560 --> 22:08.000
I have a proposal
here for a shopping centre

22:08.000 --> 22:08.160
I have a proposal
here for a shopping centre

22:08.200 --> 22:10.520
in the middle of the town.
This... Go on.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.440
..this will bring
jobs and money to Carmarthen

22:13.480 --> 22:16.000
and I think we should all get behind
it. Where in the middle of town?

22:16.000 --> 22:16.720
and I think we should all get behind
it. Where in the middle of town?

22:16.760 --> 22:19.600
The Lyric Theatre.
What?

22:19.640 --> 22:23.800
This is my passion project. Huh?

22:23.840 --> 22:24.000
Come here.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.440
Come here.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.720
That old cinema
is slowly falling apart

22:30.760 --> 22:32.000
and quickly going
out of business, huh?

22:32.000 --> 22:33.280
and quickly going
out of business, huh?

22:33.320 --> 22:37.600
Nobody goes there any more,
the Lyric, not even the kids.

22:37.640 --> 22:40.000
They're all into their
skateboarding, isn't it?

22:40.000 --> 22:40.040
They're all into their
skateboarding, isn't it?

22:40.080 --> 22:42.080
Skateboarding.
Hmm?

22:42.120 --> 22:44.880
I'm planning to build them a
special place for that in the park.

22:44.920 --> 22:48.000
No, no, no. This is a golden
opportunity to bring jobs

22:48.000 --> 22:48.400
No, no, no. This is a golden
opportunity to bring jobs

22:48.440 --> 22:50.640
and life back to Carmarthen.

22:50.680 --> 22:52.680
Hmm?

22:52.720 --> 22:55.520
It's about securing
the future of our town.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.360
It's what Emlyn would have wanted.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.520
This is outrageous!
I'm calling a vote.

23:03.560 --> 23:04.000
All those opposed.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.560
All those opposed.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.600
Aye.
Aye.

23:07.640 --> 23:11.040
Aye. Aye.
All those in favour.

23:11.080 --> 23:12.000
Aye.
Aye.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.920
Aye.
Aye.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.920
Aye.
Aye.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.560
Goodridge?
Aye.

23:24.600 --> 23:28.000
I declare the motion carried.

23:28.000 --> 23:28.200
I declare the motion carried.

23:35.400 --> 23:36.000
I don't...

23:36.000 --> 23:37.960
I don't...

24:28.560 --> 24:30.960
It's terrible.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
I've never seen such
a miserable bunch in all my life.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.120
I've never seen such
a miserable bunch in all my life.

24:34.160 --> 24:38.520
Are you supposed to be happy or sad?

24:38.560 --> 24:40.000
Happy. So, why are you
all looking so bloody miserable?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.480
Happy. So, why are you
all looking so bloody miserable?

24:42.640 --> 24:45.920
I want to see some
joy in your faces.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.000
Right. Jump up and down.
Shake it out. Right. Go again.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.560
Right. Jump up and down.
Shake it out. Right. Go again.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.600
Remember, happy.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
The council just voted
to knock down the Lyric.

25:02.040 --> 25:04.000
What? They're turning it
into a shopping centre.

25:04.000 --> 25:04.120
What? They're turning it
into a shopping centre.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.560
They can't.
They already have.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.000
Mayor Jenkins,
I've just learned that the council

25:12.000 --> 25:13.160
Mayor Jenkins,
I've just learned that the council

25:13.200 --> 25:15.400
has voted to turn the Lyric
into a shopping centre.

25:15.440 --> 25:18.640
Oh! Hello, Mrs Evans.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.000
That's correct.

25:20.000 --> 25:20.680
That's correct.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.160
It was a majority decision.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.200
But you can't do that.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.240
A town without a theatre
loses its heart.

25:27.280 --> 25:28.000
Children without
creativity lose hope.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.280
Children without
creativity lose hope.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.120
Am I right, David?
Yes, Liz, you are, yeah.

25:31.160 --> 25:35.120
When I was elected mayor, I promised
to bring prosperity to Carmarthen.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.000
That's exactly what we're doing.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.640
That's exactly what we're doing.

25:37.680 --> 25:40.440
Bringing chain stores in here will
force local shops out of business.

25:40.480 --> 25:42.680
It's happening all over the place.
Am I right, David?

25:42.720 --> 25:44.000
Yes, Liz, yes.
We've made our decision.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.120
Yes, Liz, yes.
We've made our decision.

25:47.080 --> 25:50.040
I'm putting on another production.
Not at the Lyric, you won't.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.000
The bulldozers arrive in two weeks.
Bulldozers?

25:52.000 --> 25:52.480
The bulldozers arrive in two weeks.
Bulldozers?

25:52.520 --> 25:54.600
It's a listed building.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.640
It's a pity, I know.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.680
But we've done a preliminary
structural report

25:58.720 --> 26:00.000
and it looks like we'll be forced
to condemn the whole building.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.720
and it looks like we'll be forced
to condemn the whole building.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.760
I'll fight you in court.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.000
Ohh! Come on now, Liz.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.520
Ohh! Come on now, Liz.

26:09.560 --> 26:13.280
You're not going to waste all
your family's money on a lawsuit.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.920
Don't try us, Mayor.

26:18.360 --> 26:20.280
You can't win.
Maybe not

26:20.320 --> 26:23.400
but I can force you to delay
for months, a year even.

26:23.440 --> 26:24.000
And how are you going to square
that with your developer friends?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.040
And how are you going to square
that with your developer friends?

26:31.040 --> 26:32.000
All right. You've got a month
if you stay out of the courts.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.640
All right. You've got a month
if you stay out of the courts.

26:35.680 --> 26:38.000
Now, Tristan, Pete.

26:38.040 --> 26:40.000
Same again? Right.
Can I get two pints of lager?

26:40.000 --> 26:42.080
Same again? Right.
Can I get two pints of lager?

26:46.120 --> 26:48.000
I bet they're all getting kickbacks
from the bloody developers.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.040
I bet they're all getting kickbacks
from the bloody developers.

26:49.080 --> 26:51.200
Honestly, love,

26:51.240 --> 26:53.920
you were brilliant. There's
nothing else you could have done.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.000
Listen to me, we are gonna make sure

26:56.000 --> 26:58.040
Listen to me, we are gonna make sure

26:58.080 --> 27:01.240
the last ever performance at the
Lyric is something to remember.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.520
I promise you. All right?

27:03.560 --> 27:04.000
Come on.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.560
Come on.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.200
All right, lads,
let's gather round now,

27:25.240 --> 27:28.000
a little bit of a warm-up.
Here we go. Yep, go.

27:28.000 --> 27:28.240
a little bit of a warm-up.
Here we go. Yep, go.

27:28.280 --> 27:31.320
That's it. Nice and low.
Yeah, start free, eh?

27:31.360 --> 27:33.840
You know what they,
no pain, no gain. That's it.

27:33.880 --> 27:36.000
Five and six and seven and eight.

27:36.000 --> 27:36.640
Five and six and seven and eight.

27:36.680 --> 27:39.040
Star jumps. Star jumps.

27:39.080 --> 27:41.280
And turn. Now run on the spot.

27:41.320 --> 27:44.000
Eat your heart out. Come on.
Faster. Drumming, boys. Drumming!

27:44.000 --> 27:46.080
Eat your heart out. Come on.
Faster. Drumming, boys. Drumming!

27:46.120 --> 27:48.120
And shake it out.

27:50.280 --> 27:52.000
A few exercises. Shoulder roll.

27:52.000 --> 27:52.520
A few exercises. Shoulder roll.

27:52.560 --> 27:56.560
Roll, roll. I haven't seen
your mam at the salon for a while.

27:56.600 --> 27:59.040
Let's have a little bit of energy.
We've got a show to do.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.000
Thanks, Steve. Gather round.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.840
Thanks, Steve. Gather round.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.880
Gather round.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.000
Nick Jones, chewing gum, out.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.160
Nick Jones, chewing gum, out.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.320
Sorry.

28:11.360 --> 28:15.520
Remember, it's no good
just singing the words.

28:16.520 --> 28:21.000
You have to feel them
and mean it. Understand?

28:21.040 --> 28:23.560
Yes.
Yes, Liz.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.000
What do you mean I ain't got
no manners? I'm a regular gent.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.600
What do you mean I ain't got
no manners? I'm a regular gent.

28:26.640 --> 28:29.360
Permit me to assist
you across the road.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.960
Well, I was only
going to the Palace.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Doorman!

28:35.480 --> 28:37.680
A cab, if you please.

28:37.720 --> 28:40.000
What are we going to do when
they close this place down, Miss?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.040
What are we going to do when
they close this place down, Miss?

28:42.080 --> 28:44.120
It'll be just terrible.

28:44.160 --> 28:47.360
Nothing is going
to happen to Youth Opera.

28:47.400 --> 28:48.000
I can promise you that.
Shall we show them how it's done?

28:48.000 --> 28:49.840
I can promise you that.
Shall we show them how it's done?

28:49.880 --> 28:51.720
Yes!

28:52.720 --> 28:54.720
Right!

29:47.000 --> 29:48.040
Off!

31:43.160 --> 31:44.000
What's wrong with you?

31:44.000 --> 31:45.160
What's wrong with you?

31:47.360 --> 31:51.960
Right now,
you should be on your way home...

31:53.280 --> 31:55.280
..to your family...

31:56.600 --> 31:58.600
..and your bed.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.400
Instead, you're here...

32:08.120 --> 32:10.120
..in the Lyric.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.000
You're bonkers.

32:16.000 --> 32:16.880
You're bonkers.

33:14.080 --> 33:16.080
Liz?

33:24.440 --> 33:26.440
Liz!

33:29.920 --> 33:32.480
Liz.
I'm sorry.

33:32.520 --> 33:35.160
Oh! Oh!

33:38.720 --> 33:40.920
I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

33:40.960 --> 33:43.480
I woke up this morning and you
weren't there, I was worried sick.

33:43.520 --> 33:44.000
I'm sorry. Ohh!
I just crashed out.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.560
I'm sorry. Ohh!
I just crashed out.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.920
Oh! You probably want to have
a shower before you go to work.

33:47.960 --> 33:51.280
I'm not going to work.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.000
Oh, no. You're not
feeling sick, are you?

33:52.000 --> 33:53.360
Oh, no. You're not
feeling sick, are you?

33:53.400 --> 33:56.040
No, no, no, no. Then go home
and have a kip, love. Come on.

33:56.080 --> 34:00.000
No. I feel fine. I'm staying here.

34:00.000 --> 34:00.160
No. I feel fine. I'm staying here.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.000
What?

34:02.040 --> 34:04.680
I'm not going to let them
knock this place down.

34:05.680 --> 34:08.000
Liz, look, they've made
their decision, all right?

34:08.000 --> 34:08.440
Liz, look, they've made
their decision, all right?

34:08.480 --> 34:10.400
The builders are
arriving this morning.

34:10.440 --> 34:12.440
Then they'll have to
knock it down with me in it.

34:12.480 --> 34:14.400
This is not what we agreed.

34:14.440 --> 34:16.000
We didn't agree anything because
I only just decided to do this.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.760
We didn't agree anything because
I only just decided to do this.

34:17.800 --> 34:20.080
Oh, David.
Oh, for Christ's sake, Liz.

34:20.120 --> 34:22.560
You've got a home and a family
to take care of, you know?

34:22.600 --> 34:24.000
Stop being ridiculous. Oh, I'm
the one being ridiculous, is it?

34:24.000 --> 34:25.400
Stop being ridiculous. Oh, I'm
the one being ridiculous, is it?

34:25.440 --> 34:27.320
I don't believe it.

34:27.480 --> 34:30.600
Oh! David. Cariad!

34:36.960 --> 34:40.000
What do you lot think you're doing?
We were told the place was vacant.

34:40.000 --> 34:40.880
What do you lot think you're doing?
We were told the place was vacant.

34:40.920 --> 34:43.600
Does it look vacant to you?
We've got a job to do, love.

34:43.640 --> 34:46.720
You need to get out of there.
And you need to get on your bike.

34:46.760 --> 34:48.000
I'll talk to my boss.
We'll be back first thing.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.600
I'll talk to my boss.
We'll be back first thing.

34:49.640 --> 34:51.760
And it won't be vacant then, either.

34:51.800 --> 34:55.320
I'll call you back. You assured
me that that building was empty.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.000
What are you talking about?

34:56.000 --> 34:57.400
What are you talking about?

34:57.440 --> 35:01.400
There is a woman
in the Lyric Theatre.

35:01.440 --> 35:04.000
Well, get your men to throw her out.

35:04.000 --> 35:04.040
Well, get your men to throw her out.

35:04.080 --> 35:06.560
They're construction workers
not bouncers.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.640
Then get the police to do it.

35:08.680 --> 35:11.320
Well, they might to want to see a
court order and to get one of those

35:11.360 --> 35:12.000
we might have to answer some
awkward questions about why

35:12.000 --> 35:13.800
we might have to answer some
awkward questions about why

35:13.840 --> 35:17.080
we're trying to demolish
a listed building. Oh!

35:17.120 --> 35:19.120
Do you really want
to open that can of worms?

35:20.880 --> 35:23.560
Look, all my boys need is a day,

35:23.600 --> 35:26.440
and that building will be condemned.
All right, all right.

35:26.480 --> 35:28.000
You said it's a woman inside the
Lyric. Uh-huh! I'll talk to her.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.280
You said it's a woman inside the
Lyric. Uh-huh! I'll talk to her.

35:31.360 --> 35:33.920
Your men will be able to
start work first thing tomorrow.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.000
All right?

35:36.000 --> 35:36.880
All right?

35:36.920 --> 35:40.920
They'd better.

36:08.080 --> 36:10.080
Doll?

36:11.120 --> 36:14.280
Dolly?
Oh!

36:14.320 --> 36:16.000
How did you get in?
The old side door.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.560
How did you get in?
The old side door.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.760
I thought the council
locked that up years ago.

36:19.800 --> 36:23.640
As you always say, Liz, where
there's a will there's a way.

36:23.680 --> 36:24.000
I've never paid to see a film here.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.680
I've never paid to see a film here.

36:25.720 --> 36:28.040
Don't worry. I shut it behind me

36:28.080 --> 36:31.000
but you're going to need new
locks for all the outside doors.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.000
I put the word out.
So, what are you doing here?

36:32.000 --> 36:33.920
I put the word out.
So, what are you doing here?

36:33.960 --> 36:37.280
Just because you've
taken a principled stand

36:37.320 --> 36:40.000
against the depredations
of crony capitalism

36:40.000 --> 36:40.600
against the depredations
of crony capitalism

36:40.640 --> 36:44.120
and to preserve
the cultural legacy of our town,

36:44.160 --> 36:47.320
doesn't mean
you have to go out of business.

36:47.360 --> 36:48.000
Mrs Hughes is booked in
for a perm at 11.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.760
Mrs Hughes is booked in
for a perm at 11.

36:49.800 --> 36:52.400
I told her to come straight here.
And she was all right with that?

36:52.440 --> 36:56.000
Thrilled. She's gonna be on stage.
She's telling all her friends.

36:56.000 --> 36:56.480
Thrilled. She's gonna be on stage.
She's telling all her friends.

36:56.520 --> 36:58.760
Liz! Liz!

36:58.800 --> 37:01.640
Oh, no!

37:01.680 --> 37:04.000
Liz! Oh!

37:04.000 --> 37:04.120
Liz! Oh!

37:04.160 --> 37:06.480
You said you wouldn't
get in our way.

37:06.520 --> 37:09.880
I said I wouldn't take you to court.
Come on, Liz.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.000
This is ridiculous.
You can't just take over the place.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.520
This is ridiculous.
You can't just take over the place.

37:13.560 --> 37:16.120
Well, that's what you're
planning to do. I'm the mayor.

37:16.160 --> 37:19.000
My job is to look after the welfare
of the people of Carmarthen.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.000
Keep up the good work.
Come right in, Mrs Hughes.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.400
Keep up the good work.
Come right in, Mrs Hughes.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.000
You won't get away with this.

37:28.000 --> 37:28.760
You won't get away with this.

37:33.440 --> 37:35.440
Ohhh!

37:50.400 --> 37:52.000
Hiya. What's going on?
We thought you might be lonely, Mam.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.640
Hiya. What's going on?
We thought you might be lonely, Mam.

37:54.680 --> 37:57.080
So did I. But instead,
I've been run off my feet.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.440
What's all this?
We just brought you a few things,

38:04.480 --> 38:06.640
you know, clothes,
stuff you might need.

38:06.680 --> 38:08.000
That's marvellous. Thank you.

38:08.000 --> 38:08.920
That's marvellous. Thank you.

38:08.960 --> 38:10.640
Mam.

38:10.680 --> 38:13.880
You need to talk to Dad, OK?
Because he's in a right state.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.000
Well, that's between me and him.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.240
Well, that's between me and him.

38:18.280 --> 38:20.120
It's none of your business.

38:20.160 --> 38:23.040
It is part of our business when
you decide to move into a theatre.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.000
Your dad's welcome
to be part of this.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.280
Your dad's welcome
to be part of this.

38:25.320 --> 38:28.120
You all are.
Liz?

38:28.160 --> 38:29.560
I'll be a minute.

38:29.600 --> 38:32.000
Listen, why don't we
talk about this later?

38:32.000 --> 38:32.760
Listen, why don't we
talk about this later?

38:32.800 --> 38:35.080
Whatever.
Oh, Huw!

38:37.560 --> 38:39.560
Come back later, OK?

38:39.600 --> 38:40.000
I'll try.
OK.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.920
I'll try.
OK.

38:41.960 --> 38:45.080
Cariad. Me too.
Call Dad.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.000
See you later.

38:48.000 --> 38:48.200
See you later.

38:48.240 --> 38:50.960
Cariad, Mam.
Caru chi.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.240
Ta-ra, Mam.
Ta-ra.

38:56.960 --> 38:59.920
You sure you're going to be
all right? I'll be fine.

38:59.960 --> 39:04.000
I'd be happy to stay. I could get
some Mad Dog in and get hammered.

39:04.000 --> 39:04.960
I'd be happy to stay. I could get
some Mad Dog in and get hammered.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.360
Remember,
tomorrow morning, first thing,

39:07.400 --> 39:09.920
eight o'clock, the first
appointment. All right Ta-ra then.

39:09.960 --> 39:11.960
You'd better lock up.
I am.

39:13.280 --> 39:16.280
Oh-oh! Yeah, eh?

39:16.320 --> 39:18.480
I haven't been back here for years.

39:19.080 --> 39:20.000
I thought you'd like
a bit of company.

39:20.000 --> 39:20.880
I thought you'd like
a bit of company.

39:20.920 --> 39:23.080
There's nothing I'd like more.
Yeah.

39:23.120 --> 39:27.240
Yeah, well, look at that.
Oooh! Eh? Come on.

39:28.080 --> 39:30.480
Look at this place.

39:30.520 --> 39:34.040
Oh! It's fantastic, isn't it?
I know.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.000
Come through here. Have a look.

39:36.000 --> 39:36.840
Come through here. Have a look.

39:36.880 --> 39:39.120
Oh!
I know.

39:39.160 --> 39:41.080
You've got it all set up.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.480
I fancied a change of scenery.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.840
What is it?
Guys And Dolls.

39:51.880 --> 39:52.000
Oh! Grand! Oh!

39:52.000 --> 39:55.600
Oh! Grand! Oh!

40:07.640 --> 40:08.000
What's your family
think of this, eh?

40:08.000 --> 40:09.640
What's your family
think of this, eh?

40:12.080 --> 40:15.560
Well, I think, for the boys,

40:15.600 --> 40:16.000
it's all a big adventure.
Mm!

40:16.000 --> 40:18.360
it's all a big adventure.
Mm!

40:18.400 --> 40:21.280
They already think
I'm a bit bonkers.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.000
But, for David, it's different.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.360
But, for David, it's different.

40:28.440 --> 40:31.480
He thinks I've got
my priorities all wrong.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.640
It's going to take a while for
people to get their heads around

40:35.680 --> 40:39.240
what's so important about
a broken-down old building like this

40:39.280 --> 40:40.000
that they have to turn
their lives around to save it.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.280
that they have to turn
their lives around to save it.

40:42.320 --> 40:44.320
Eh?

40:44.360 --> 40:46.520
It doesn't look like much, does it?
Hm!

40:48.600 --> 40:50.600
You know I used to have a job here.

40:51.800 --> 40:54.040
No.
Yeah.

40:55.920 --> 40:56.000
Come on.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.920
Come on.

40:57.960 --> 40:59.960
I want to show you something.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
What?
Come on.

41:02.040 --> 41:04.000
I'm intrigued.
Yeah?

41:04.000 --> 41:04.040
I'm intrigued.
Yeah?

41:13.640 --> 41:15.640
Oh, God!

41:15.680 --> 41:18.520
Are you all right?
What? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:18.560 --> 41:20.000
I'm just getting
a bit short of breath.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.600
I'm just getting
a bit short of breath.

41:22.640 --> 41:25.920
Eh? I'm all right. Come on.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.400
Oh! Wow!

41:35.440 --> 41:36.000
Oh! It's almost 50 years
since I worked here.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.960
Oh! It's almost 50 years
since I worked here.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.640
Well, it hasn't changed much.

41:42.680 --> 41:44.000
So, that was before you were
a teacher? Oh, yeah, long before.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.440
So, that was before you were
a teacher? Oh, yeah, long before.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.480
Yeah.

41:48.520 --> 41:51.560
No, I was, er...
I was wounded in the war.

41:51.600 --> 41:52.000
And they sent me home and I got
a job here at the "new" cinema.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.920
And they sent me home and I got
a job here at the "new" cinema.

41:58.360 --> 42:00.000
Oh! I must have seen over
a hundred films from up here.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.880
Oh! I must have seen over
a hundred films from up here.

42:04.200 --> 42:06.200
What was your favourite?

42:08.200 --> 42:10.000
Goodbye, Mr Chips.

42:10.040 --> 42:12.040
Hm.
You know it? No.

42:12.080 --> 42:15.640
Oh! It's almost a perfect film.

42:15.680 --> 42:16.000
It's tragic, it's sweet, it's funny.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.840
It's tragic, it's sweet, it's funny.

42:17.880 --> 42:20.000
It's... But the ending...

42:20.040 --> 42:22.920
Oh! ..the ending
is a real tearjerker.

42:22.960 --> 42:24.000
Yeah.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.600
Yeah.

42:25.640 --> 42:31.040
Robert Donat is lying on his
deathbed and he's got one regret,

42:31.080 --> 42:32.000
that he never had
any children of his own.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.720
that he never had
any children of his own.

42:33.760 --> 42:36.960
Yeah? Then he realises
he's wrong, see?

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
He's had thousands of them, the
thousands of children he's taught

42:40.000 --> 42:40.520
He's had thousands of them, the
thousands of children he's taught

42:40.560 --> 42:42.560
and whose lives he's touched.

42:42.600 --> 42:44.440
Ha!

42:44.480 --> 42:48.000
Well, after that,
I knew I had to become a teacher.

42:48.000 --> 42:48.320
Well, after that,
I knew I had to become a teacher.

42:53.840 --> 42:56.000
Wouldn't it be great
if we could put on a film?

42:56.000 --> 42:58.360
Wouldn't it be great
if we could put on a film?

42:58.400 --> 43:01.320
For who? Anyone,
anyone who wants to come.

43:01.360 --> 43:03.720
Well, I'd be up for it.

43:03.760 --> 43:04.000
How can we get hold of one?
Um... Well, there's nothing here.

43:04.000 --> 43:08.200
How can we get hold of one?
Um... Well, there's nothing here.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.000
Do you remember Mr Tucker?

43:12.000 --> 43:12.880
Do you remember Mr Tucker?

43:13.880 --> 43:17.680
Yes, I do.
He was my old history teacher. Yes.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.000
Well, we worked in here together.
Oh! He left before I did

43:20.000 --> 43:20.600
Well, we worked in here together.
Oh! He left before I did

43:20.640 --> 43:23.680
and he formed
a film club in the town.

43:23.720 --> 43:27.640
He shouldn't have done, mind, but
he kept back a few 35-mil prints.

43:27.680 --> 43:28.000
Oh! Yeah.
Why don't I go and see him tomorrow?

43:28.000 --> 43:30.600
Oh! Yeah.
Why don't I go and see him tomorrow?

43:30.640 --> 43:34.240
See what he's got.
That would be amazing.

43:34.280 --> 43:36.000
Wouldn't it? Mm!

43:36.000 --> 43:36.600
Wouldn't it? Mm!

43:36.640 --> 43:38.640
That would be amazing. Oh!

45:15.400 --> 45:18.320
Morning, Mrs Jones.
Morning.

45:19.600 --> 45:20.000
Morning, Mr Hopkins.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.560
Morning, Mr Hopkins.

45:21.600 --> 45:24.680
Lovely day, isn't it? Rubbish men
haven't been again this week.

45:24.720 --> 45:27.480
That needs organising.
It's a problem.

45:27.520 --> 45:28.000
I'll talk to the mayor
about it today, OK?

45:28.000 --> 45:29.520
I'll talk to the mayor
about it today, OK?

45:29.560 --> 45:31.560
Your father would have
had it sorted by now.

45:31.600 --> 45:34.720
Only saying.
Have a good day.

46:02.320 --> 46:04.400
Um...

46:04.440 --> 46:06.440
All right?

46:06.480 --> 46:08.000
Hi.
I'm Dai. Nick is my boy.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.240
Hi.
I'm Dai. Nick is my boy.

46:09.280 --> 46:12.480
Hiya. I... I...
I thought you were banged up.

46:12.520 --> 46:14.680
I'm out on parole, I am.

46:14.720 --> 46:16.000
Thought I'd make
myself a bit useful.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.040
Thought I'd make
myself a bit useful.

46:17.080 --> 46:19.600
And there's not a lot
I don't know about locks.

46:19.640 --> 46:22.560
Oh, cheers, Dai.

46:22.600 --> 46:24.000
Thank you.
All right.

46:24.000 --> 46:24.600
Thank you.
All right.

46:28.440 --> 46:32.000
Can you believe they want
to tear all this down? Yes.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.680
Can you believe they want
to tear all this down? Yes.

46:34.960 --> 46:37.680
What do you mean?
Mam.

46:37.720 --> 46:40.000
I know how much
this place means to you

46:40.040 --> 46:44.400
but the truth is it's just a cinema,
a cold, draughty cinema that

46:44.440 --> 46:46.880
mainly shows films
that nobody wants to see.

46:48.440 --> 46:51.840
I thought you were with me on this.
We are with you, Mam.

46:51.880 --> 46:54.160
Turning this place into a shopping
centre would be a crime

46:54.200 --> 46:56.000
And I'm sure it's being done
for all the wrong reasons.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.160
And I'm sure it's being done
for all the wrong reasons.

46:57.200 --> 47:00.320
But unless you can show
people why it's so important,

47:00.360 --> 47:02.680
maybe a shopping
centre is what they deserve.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.880
I've got more faith
in people than that.

47:06.920 --> 47:08.920
Yeah, Mam.

47:08.960 --> 47:11.240
You'll figure it out.

47:11.280 --> 47:12.000
Right.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.600
Right.

47:13.640 --> 47:15.640
Oh!

47:15.680 --> 47:17.680
Front, back, side.

47:17.720 --> 47:20.000
No-one's getting in
you don't want to.

47:20.000 --> 47:20.320
No-one's getting in
you don't want to.

47:20.360 --> 47:22.880
Thank you so much.
How much do I owe you?

47:22.920 --> 47:25.680
No, no, no, no.
It's the least I can do.

47:25.720 --> 47:28.000
What you've done for Nick.
I've never seen him happier.

47:28.000 --> 47:28.280
What you've done for Nick.
I've never seen him happier.

47:28.320 --> 47:31.360
And I might have found myself
a new line of work.

47:39.080 --> 47:42.000
Hello!

47:43.120 --> 47:44.000
I'm still here.
I've got a structural survey here,

47:44.000 --> 47:46.720
I'm still here.
I've got a structural survey here,

47:46.760 --> 47:50.200
it says the building is unsafe. I've
had professional builders in here,

47:50.240 --> 47:52.000
ones who have not been paid off by
the mayor and his developer friends,

47:52.000 --> 47:53.040
ones who have not been paid off by
the mayor and his developer friends,

47:53.080 --> 47:55.000
who say it's perfectly sound.

47:55.040 --> 47:59.240
Oh, and if you see the mayor, you
can ask him why he let his daughter

47:59.280 --> 48:00.000
perform on stage
less than a week ago

48:00.000 --> 48:01.320
perform on stage
less than a week ago

48:01.360 --> 48:04.320
if he thought it
was unsafe or dangerous.

48:04.360 --> 48:08.000
Oh, just so you know,
I'm not on my own in here any more.

48:08.000 --> 48:08.440
Oh, just so you know,
I'm not on my own in here any more.

48:11.120 --> 48:12.720
Piss off!

48:12.760 --> 48:15.200
I guess that means you're not
planning to leave anytime soon.

48:15.240 --> 48:16.000
Good guess.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.160
Good guess.

48:19.520 --> 48:23.480
Morning, Mayor. We really need
to sort out this bin problem.

48:23.520 --> 48:24.000
I know. I've got a meeting
with the union next week.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.600
I know. I've got a meeting
with the union next week.

48:26.640 --> 48:28.840
Right now, I've got
bigger problems with the Lyric.

48:28.880 --> 48:30.640
Ugh!

48:30.680 --> 48:32.000
Liz Evans is refusing to budge.
Hmmm!

48:32.000 --> 48:33.200
Liz Evans is refusing to budge.
Hmmm!

48:33.240 --> 48:35.680
Everyone was talking about that
on my rounds this morning.

48:35.720 --> 48:38.960
God! What were they saying?

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
Just that she's not budging.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Just that she's not budging.

48:42.040 --> 48:44.040
You know, she's doing
people's hair in there.

48:44.080 --> 48:47.200
Right up on the stage. It's... Huh.

48:49.120 --> 48:51.920
Interesting. The Lyric is licensed
as a place of entertainment

48:51.960 --> 48:56.000
not as a hair salon. If we can
prove she's working illegally...

48:56.000 --> 48:56.200
not as a hair salon. If we can
prove she's working illegally...

48:56.240 --> 48:59.200
Ha-ha! ..I can get
the police to kick her out.

49:00.200 --> 49:03.320
Do you think a few perms and
highlights are worth a police raid?

49:03.360 --> 49:04.000
They don't need have to go in with
guns a-blazing like in the movies.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.040
They don't need have to go in with
guns a-blazing like in the movies.

49:06.080 --> 49:08.480
They just need to serve her
with a legal notice to quit.

49:08.520 --> 49:10.520
But we need proof.

49:10.560 --> 49:12.000
Huh! They're not gonna let me
anywhere near that place.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.200
Huh! They're not gonna let me
anywhere near that place.

49:14.800 --> 49:17.120
You, on the other hand...

49:17.160 --> 49:19.800
No, I'm...
I'm not much of a spy, Mayor.

49:19.840 --> 49:20.000
Oh, everybody knows you, Richard.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.920
Oh, everybody knows you, Richard.

49:21.960 --> 49:24.120
I don't think it's...
You're their postman.

49:24.160 --> 49:27.480
A couple of photos of what they're
doing is all we need. Go on, go on.

49:30.280 --> 49:32.280
Right.

49:33.320 --> 49:35.320
Just a couple of photos.

49:37.640 --> 49:40.520
Yes, sir.
Just a couple.

49:48.360 --> 49:50.360
Hiya.

49:50.400 --> 49:52.000
I was wondering if one evening
you might fancy a drink.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.040
I was wondering if one evening
you might fancy a drink.

49:54.080 --> 49:56.240
I don't think so, Councillor.
Huh!

49:56.280 --> 49:59.480
I promise I won't bore you with
my Welsh medieval history stories.

49:59.520 --> 50:00.000
I thought you were
a nice guy until you voted

50:00.000 --> 50:01.520
I thought you were
a nice guy until you voted

50:01.560 --> 50:04.200
to turn the Lyric
into a shopping centre.

50:04.240 --> 50:07.080
How much are they paying you?
Nothing.

50:07.120 --> 50:08.000
What do you mean? I know
he and his cronies are corrupt.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.960
What do you mean? I know
he and his cronies are corrupt.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.840
I know they're getting kickbacks.
What's your excuse?

50:25.880 --> 50:29.560
All right. There you go, lovely.

50:29.600 --> 50:32.000
There we go. Let's head over here.

50:32.000 --> 50:32.680
There we go. Let's head over here.

50:32.720 --> 50:35.960
There you go. One second.
You don't want one, Liz?

50:36.000 --> 50:39.880
What is it?
Oh, it's my experimental cocktail.

50:39.920 --> 50:40.000
Three parts brandy,
two parts rum, tomato juice

50:40.000 --> 50:42.560
Three parts brandy,
two parts rum, tomato juice

50:42.600 --> 50:45.920
and a splash of vodka.
It sounds horrible. It does.

50:45.960 --> 50:48.000
That's where you're wrong. Goes down
like a homesick mole, doesn't it?

50:48.000 --> 50:49.360
That's where you're wrong. Goes down
like a homesick mole, doesn't it?

50:54.200 --> 50:56.000
Dolly, can you
take over for a minute?

50:56.000 --> 50:56.920
Dolly, can you
take over for a minute?

50:58.320 --> 50:59.960
Er, yeah, course.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
Have a look around here.

51:04.000 --> 51:04.120
Have a look around here.

51:10.480 --> 51:11.960
Hi.

51:14.960 --> 51:17.080
Hiya. You all right?

51:18.960 --> 51:20.000
Is there somewhere we can talk?

51:20.000 --> 51:20.960
Is there somewhere we can talk?

51:30.520 --> 51:32.520
You know, I was thinking,

51:32.840 --> 51:35.960
I think our first ever
kiss was right here.

51:36.960 --> 51:39.600
No.

51:39.640 --> 51:42.880
It was right there, in fact.

51:42.920 --> 51:44.000
And I certainly remember it.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.560
And I certainly remember it.

51:50.720 --> 51:52.000
How can you not love this place?

51:52.000 --> 51:53.240
How can you not love this place?

51:53.280 --> 51:55.880
It's part of our history.

51:57.240 --> 51:59.240
Yeah.

52:00.640 --> 52:03.000
I guess the world
has moved on, Libby.

52:09.040 --> 52:11.040
What's bothering you?

52:12.520 --> 52:14.520
Oh, it's nothing. It's just...

52:16.400 --> 52:19.200
A lot of the men
need the work, love.

52:19.240 --> 52:21.600
It's years of
employment being offered

52:21.640 --> 52:23.640
to build the shopping centre.

52:23.680 --> 52:24.000
Nobody wants to see
Youth Opera closed, they just...

52:24.000 --> 52:27.560
Nobody wants to see
Youth Opera closed, they just...

52:28.680 --> 52:30.680
Well, they...

52:33.680 --> 52:36.280
It's just a building, innit?

52:37.680 --> 52:39.680
No.

52:40.680 --> 52:42.680
No, it's not.

52:45.760 --> 52:48.000
The Lyric is staying.

52:48.000 --> 52:48.800
The Lyric is staying.

53:01.240 --> 53:03.960
Liz!

53:06.760 --> 53:08.760
Oh!

53:10.640 --> 53:12.000
Hey. I've got it, huh?
That's fantastic.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.360
Hey. I've got it, huh?
That's fantastic.

53:15.400 --> 53:18.320
Take this, it's heavy, mind.
OK. There.

53:18.360 --> 53:20.000
What is it?
How Green Was My Valley.

53:20.000 --> 53:20.960
What is it?
How Green Was My Valley.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.320
How Green Was My Valley?

53:23.360 --> 53:26.440
Yeah. It's a classic.
You must have seen it.

53:26.480 --> 53:28.000
Well, I read the book at school.

53:28.000 --> 53:28.880
Well, I read the book at school.

53:30.760 --> 53:33.880
Is that all Mr Tucker had?
Yeah, pretty much but it's perfect.

53:33.920 --> 53:36.000
It was made in 1941.

53:36.040 --> 53:39.800
So, it's in black and white?
Of course. Yeah.

53:39.840 --> 53:41.800
Now look at this, see? See that?

53:41.840 --> 53:43.760
Directed by John Ford.

53:43.800 --> 53:44.000
Now he's the one that gave us
Stagecoach, The Searchers,

53:44.000 --> 53:46.360
Now he's the one that gave us
Stagecoach, The Searchers,

53:46.400 --> 53:48.360
The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.
But this,

53:48.400 --> 53:50.640
this is the only
one that won the Oscar

53:50.680 --> 53:52.000
for best picture and best director.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.560
for best picture and best director.

53:54.680 --> 53:57.320
Oh, I'm not sure the kids
are going to want to see this.

53:57.360 --> 53:59.960
Oh, we don't have
to worry about them.

54:02.320 --> 54:04.760
Don't we?
No.

54:04.800 --> 54:08.000
Young people are busy
making their own history, hmm?

54:08.000 --> 54:08.120
Young people are busy
making their own history, hmm?

54:08.160 --> 54:10.960
It's only when you get to
a certain age you realise

54:11.000 --> 54:13.800
that memory is the most
precious thing in the world.

54:13.840 --> 54:16.000
And that's before
you get to the age

54:16.000 --> 54:16.120
And that's before
you get to the age

54:16.160 --> 54:19.640
when you realise that memory
is the only thing you have left.

54:23.440 --> 54:24.000
Look at this place.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.440
Look at this place.

54:30.240 --> 54:31.800
Oh!

54:34.840 --> 54:37.600
I mean, look at this place, huh?

54:37.640 --> 54:39.640
Oh, look.

54:44.680 --> 54:47.200
This place holds so many memories

54:47.240 --> 54:48.000
for so many people in this town.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.640
for so many people in this town.

54:52.960 --> 54:54.960
And they're the ones
who will get behind you

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
when they realise
what they're about to lose.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.560
when they realise
what they're about to lose.

55:01.280 --> 55:04.000
Well, we'd better
let them know it's on then.

55:04.000 --> 55:04.960
Well, we'd better
let them know it's on then.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
We should.

55:50.800 --> 55:52.000
How Green Was My Valley

55:52.000 --> 55:53.360
How Green Was My Valley

55:53.400 --> 55:56.080
I remember that, love.

55:56.120 --> 55:58.960
It's at the Lyric.
Yeah? Yeah.

57:18.960 --> 57:20.000
Excuse me. Do you know what's on?

57:20.000 --> 57:20.960
Excuse me. Do you know what's on?

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
They're showing
How Green Was My Valley for free.

57:37.720 --> 57:40.720
I am packing my belongings in
the shawl my mother used to wear

57:40.760 --> 57:44.000
when she went to the market.
And I am going from my valley.

57:44.000 --> 57:44.200
when she went to the market.
And I am going from my valley.

57:44.240 --> 57:47.440
And this time I shall never return.

57:48.440 --> 57:51.720
I am leaving behind me
my 50 years of memory.

57:51.760 --> 57:52.000
Memory.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.560
Memory.

57:53.600 --> 57:56.120
Strange that the mind... Richard!
..will forget... Richard!

57:56.160 --> 57:58.600
..so much of what only
this moment is past... Sit here.

57:58.640 --> 58:00.000
..and yet hold clear and bright the
memory of what happened years ago,

58:00.000 --> 58:02.120
..and yet hold clear and bright the
memory of what happened years ago,

58:02.160 --> 58:05.240
of men and women long since dead.

58:05.280 --> 58:08.000
Yet who shall say what
is real and what is not?

58:08.000 --> 58:08.760
Yet who shall say what
is real and what is not?

58:08.800 --> 58:11.200
And I believe my friends all gone...
Pick and Mix?

58:11.240 --> 58:15.080
..when their voices
are still a glory in my ears?

58:15.120 --> 58:16.000
No. And I will stand
to say no and no again,

58:16.000 --> 58:18.800
No. And I will stand
to say no and no again,

58:18.840 --> 58:21.960
for they remain a living
truth within my mind.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
There is no fence nor hedge
round Time that is gone.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.680
There is no fence nor hedge
round Time that is gone.

58:25.720 --> 58:29.560
And the valley would ring
with the sound of many voices,

58:29.600 --> 58:32.000
for singing is in my people
as sight is in the eye.

58:32.000 --> 58:32.840
for singing is in my people
as sight is in the eye.

1:00:40.720 --> 1:00:43.400
Men like my father cannot die.

1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:45.480
They are with me still,

1:00:45.520 --> 1:00:48.000
real in memory
as they were in flesh,

1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:48.760
real in memory
as they were in flesh,

1:00:48.800 --> 1:00:51.320
loving and beloved forever.

1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:54.240
How green was my valley then.

1:01:52.440 --> 1:01:55.720
What?
Yankee sugar-coated bullshit.

1:01:55.760 --> 1:01:58.840
Those cheery miners
singing like Disney dwarfs.

1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:00.000
They're victims of
capitalist exploitation.

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:01.120
They're victims of
capitalist exploitation.

1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:04.640
Have you no bloody soul? It's
a celebration of a way of life.

1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:08.000
- And they seem to like it.
- More! Yeah!

1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:11.840
- And they seem to like it.
- More! Yeah!

1:02:11.880 --> 1:02:13.880
Miserable sod.

1:02:18.040 --> 1:02:20.160
Thank you so much for coming.

1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:23.880
I saw a tear in your eye
during some of those scenes.

1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:24.000
It was very dusty in there.
Aye, aye.

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.920
It was very dusty in there.
Aye, aye.

1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:30.720
We can agree to disagree
about Hollywood's

1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:32.000
depiction of Welsh culture

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:32.760
depiction of Welsh culture

1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:35.000
but that's the point
of the arts, isn't it?

1:02:35.040 --> 1:02:37.440
They cause controversy.
Oh, absolutely.

1:02:37.480 --> 1:02:40.000
That's why we've got to join
the fight to save this place

1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:40.560
That's why we've got to join
the fight to save this place

1:02:40.600 --> 1:02:42.600
from that sleazeball of a mayor.

1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:45.960
I mean, a new Woolworths
doesn't spark much debate, does it?

1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.000
Well, their pick and mix does.

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:49.000
Well, their pick and mix does.

1:02:49.040 --> 1:02:52.800
Congratulations to both of you.
I thought that went really well, eh?

1:02:52.840 --> 1:02:54.800
Fabulous. Yeah.
I loved the singing.

1:02:54.840 --> 1:02:56.000
Did you hear me? I was upstairs
singing. No. Yes, yes.

1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:57.240
Did you hear me? I was upstairs
singing. No. Yes, yes.

1:02:57.280 --> 1:03:00.560
- I took a solo.
- Oh!

1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:02.840
Why don't you come by
tomorrow night for dinner?

1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:04.000
We'll work out what
we're going to put on next.

1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:04.920
We'll work out what
we're going to put on next.

1:03:04.960 --> 1:03:07.200
Yeah, yeah, I'd like that.

1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:36.000
Carmarthen Police
Get me SI Roberts on the phone.

1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:36.240
Carmarthen Police
Get me SI Roberts on the phone.

1:03:57.080 --> 1:03:58.720
I'm coming.

1:04:07.440 --> 1:04:08.000
Liz Evans? Yes.
This is a warrant for your arrest.

1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:11.400
Liz Evans? Yes.
This is a warrant for your arrest.

1:04:16.040 --> 1:04:18.040
Go back.

1:04:18.080 --> 1:04:21.480
Go back, inside, inside.

1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:29.520
Right. Here we go.

1:04:34.600 --> 1:04:38.120
Good. Let me know the minute
the building is totally cleared.

1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:44.640
Susan? Susan!

1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:48.000
Susan!

1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:48.040
Susan!

1:04:48.080 --> 1:04:52.720
We need to get social services
down here right away.

1:04:52.760 --> 1:04:56.000
There's two minors at least.
There's nothing we can do about it.

1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:56.200
There's two minors at least.
There's nothing we can do about it.

1:04:56.240 --> 1:04:58.400
I'm from the council.

1:04:58.440 --> 1:05:01.320
Mam?
Stop what you're doing.

1:05:01.360 --> 1:05:03.960
Who are you?
Their lawyer. Sorry I'm late.

1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:06.520
You can tell your clients,
I've got them bang to rights.

1:05:06.560 --> 1:05:09.680
Bang to rights? You've been
watching too many police dramas.

1:05:10.680 --> 1:05:12.000
OK. Criminal trespass and
operating an unlicensed business.

1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:14.000
OK. Criminal trespass and
operating an unlicensed business.

1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:17.520
And the complaint
was filed by USG Screens.

1:05:17.560 --> 1:05:20.000
I represent USG.
My clients lease this building.

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:20.400
I represent USG.
My clients lease this building.

1:05:20.440 --> 1:05:22.680
Excellent. Do you have
a copy of the lease with you?

1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:30.960
Thank you.

1:05:35.440 --> 1:05:36.000
Paragraph 15,
section C, subsection three,

1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:38.320
Paragraph 15,
section C, subsection three,

1:05:38.360 --> 1:05:41.240
grants access to employees
of the town council.

1:05:43.960 --> 1:05:44.000
See? Well, we won't
be arresting you then.

1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:46.160
See? Well, we won't
be arresting you then.

1:05:46.200 --> 1:05:49.840
But they're coming with me.
No, no, please. It's OK.

1:05:49.880 --> 1:05:52.000
Look at me, look at me.
Paragraph 26, section D,

1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:52.960
Look at me, look at me.
Paragraph 26, section D,

1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:55.720
subsection four.
The stage of the Lyric Theatre

1:05:55.760 --> 1:05:58.280
will be made available
to the Carmarthen Youth Opera

1:05:58.320 --> 1:06:00.000
up to four times a year.

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:00.320
up to four times a year.

1:06:00.360 --> 1:06:03.800
They are the principals of
the Carmarthen Youth Opera.

1:06:03.840 --> 1:06:07.520
It's them. I saw them in Jesus
Christ Superstar. It was brilliant.

1:06:09.760 --> 1:06:13.280
We've still got them on
operating an unlicensed business.

1:06:13.320 --> 1:06:15.880
Oh, Mam, please. Have you ever
been to a theatre before, officer?

1:06:15.920 --> 1:06:16.000
That is a set.

1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:18.080
That is a set.

1:06:18.120 --> 1:06:20.640
For what?

1:06:21.640 --> 1:06:24.000
Um... Hairspray.
Oh! I saw the film of that, yeah.

1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:24.960
Um... Hairspray.
Oh! I saw the film of that, yeah.

1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:28.120
Debbie Harry was in it.
I was on my own mind but it was...

1:06:28.160 --> 1:06:30.160
brilliant.

1:06:30.200 --> 1:06:32.000
I suggest you release everyone
without charges and leave right now.

1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:33.280
I suggest you release everyone
without charges and leave right now.

1:06:33.320 --> 1:06:35.320
Or you can tell the world
in open court,

1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:38.080
that you arrested a bunch of
actors for being on a stage.

1:06:40.360 --> 1:06:42.240
Thank you.

1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:51.720
And we need that front door
fixed by the morning.

1:06:51.760 --> 1:06:54.760
They did it.
So sue them.

1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:08.440
Susan!
Thank you so much.

1:07:08.480 --> 1:07:10.480
How did you do that?

1:07:15.480 --> 1:07:18.240
Have you boys heard the story
of how your mam and dad

1:07:18.280 --> 1:07:20.000
fell in love on stage? Only about
a hundred times. Oh, yes.

1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:21.600
fell in love on stage? Only about
a hundred times. Oh, yes.

1:07:21.640 --> 1:07:26.120
Stella... Stella! ALL: Stella!
That's you that is. It's Brando.

1:07:26.160 --> 1:07:28.000
I have always depended on
the kindness of strangers.

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:29.600
I have always depended on
the kindness of strangers.

1:07:29.640 --> 1:07:31.800
That was pretty good.
I did not do it like that.

1:07:31.840 --> 1:07:34.320
You did, Mam. You've got to admit
he's pretty good, isn't he?

1:07:34.360 --> 1:07:36.000
Have you seen the film?
Have you seen the film?

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:36.360
Have you seen the film?
Have you seen the film?

1:07:36.400 --> 1:07:38.400
I haven't seen the film, no.
Marlon Brando.

1:07:38.440 --> 1:07:41.600
Stella!

1:07:41.640 --> 1:07:44.000
So, have you ever acted, Mr Morgan?
Ah! Yeah, well, in my dreams.

1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:45.560
So, have you ever acted, Mr Morgan?
Ah! Yeah, well, in my dreams.

1:07:45.600 --> 1:07:47.600
Oh!
Yeah.

1:07:47.640 --> 1:07:51.320
Must be wonderful, eh? Stand on
a stage, look out at the audience

1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:52.000
and know you've got them
in the palm of your hand here.

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:53.480
and know you've got them
in the palm of your hand here.

1:07:53.520 --> 1:07:55.640
Must be the best
feeling in the world.

1:07:55.680 --> 1:07:58.360
I love it. Hmm!
A bit like teaching.

1:07:58.400 --> 1:08:00.000
You know, standing
in front of a class.

1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:00.880
You know, standing
in front of a class.

1:08:00.920 --> 1:08:03.960
Yeah. Did you boys
like the film last night?

1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:06.280
Yeah, we did.
I mean, it was a bit cheesy.

1:08:06.320 --> 1:08:08.000
Cheesy? But towards the end...
How Green Was My Valley cheesy?

1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:09.760
Cheesy? But towards the end...
How Green Was My Valley cheesy?

1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:12.040
It was in black and white.
I don't agree with that.

1:08:12.080 --> 1:08:15.840
So, what are we
going to put on next?

1:08:15.880 --> 1:08:16.000
Well, whatever it is, it'll
have to be something popular.

1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:18.880
Well, whatever it is, it'll
have to be something popular.

1:08:18.920 --> 1:08:21.760
This place has got to work
as a business, isn't it? Yes.

1:08:21.800 --> 1:08:23.880
Otherwise, it will be
a struggle to keep open.

1:08:23.920 --> 1:08:24.000
I agree. It's got to be something
that will bring the kids in.

1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:26.720
I agree. It's got to be something
that will bring the kids in.

1:08:26.760 --> 1:08:30.920
Your friends. Something new.
Something new. Something new?

1:08:30.960 --> 1:08:32.000
Yes. Such as? Come on.
I haven't got a clue.

1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.120
Yes. Such as? Come on.
I haven't got a clue.

1:08:34.160 --> 1:08:36.160
You've got school in the morning.

1:08:36.200 --> 1:08:39.120
Oh! Oh! Well...

1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:40.000
Well, that was a wonderful evening.
Thanks so much, eh?

1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:43.360
Well, that was a wonderful evening.
Thanks so much, eh?

1:08:43.400 --> 1:08:45.640
I'd be happy to run you home.
Oh, no, no, no.

1:08:45.680 --> 1:08:48.000
Oh, listen, could you bring those
cans of film for me sometime?

1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:49.000
Oh, listen, could you bring those
cans of film for me sometime?

1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:51.520
Yeah. No urgency, you know.
Tomorrow on the way back from work.

1:08:51.560 --> 1:08:54.120
Yeah. All right. Nos da.
Nos da. Nos da now.

1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:56.000
Nos da! Nos da.
Tara, Mam. Cariad.

1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:56.840
Nos da! Nos da.
Tara, Mam. Cariad.

1:08:56.880 --> 1:08:59.000
Are you gonna be all right now?
I'll be fine. Mmm!

1:09:00.080 --> 1:09:02.560
Make sure they go to bed. Yeah,
I will, don't worry. You know.

1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:04.000
Yeah, I know.
No television. OK.

1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:04.640
Yeah, I know.
No television. OK.

1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:06.680
Nos da.
Nos da.

1:09:07.680 --> 1:09:09.640
Goodbye, Mr Morgan.

1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:12.000
Goodbye.

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:13.160
Goodbye.

1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:19.360
Right. I'll get you boys home, yeah?

1:09:19.400 --> 1:09:20.000
Come on with me.

1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:21.400
Come on with me.

1:09:53.960 --> 1:09:55.960
I thought you'd gone home.

1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:58.040
Look, I just wanted
to come back and, er...

1:09:58.080 --> 1:10:00.000
Well,

1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:00.080
Well,

1:10:00.120 --> 1:10:02.960
ask your forgiveness.

1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000
For what?

1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.000
For ever doubting you.

1:10:08.040 --> 1:10:10.040
You proved to me...

1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:12.920
Well, not just to me, to everyone,

1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:14.960
that this place
is worth fighting for.

1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:16.000
Look, I should have been all in
from the beginning, I know.

1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:20.640
Look, I should have been all in
from the beginning, I know.

1:10:20.680 --> 1:10:24.000
But I am now... and forever.

1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:24.360
But I am now... and forever.

1:10:27.480 --> 1:10:29.480
Oh, David.

1:10:33.560 --> 1:10:35.560
I love you.

1:10:35.600 --> 1:10:37.600
I love you too, Liz.

1:10:39.160 --> 1:10:40.000
They're very expensive. Oh, just
from the garage.

1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:42.960
They're very expensive. Oh, just
from the garage.

1:10:50.160 --> 1:10:52.160
Mam! Mam!

1:10:52.200 --> 1:10:55.200
Mam! Mam, look at this,
look at this.

1:10:55.240 --> 1:10:56.000
What is it? It's a trade magazine.
We sent off for it.

1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.520
What is it? It's a trade magazine.
We sent off for it.

1:10:58.560 --> 1:11:01.280
It has a list of all the films that
are coming out. Look at The Firm.

1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:03.440
That's with Tom Cruise in it.
That'll be really good.

1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:04.000
Or Free Willy.
That looks even better.

1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:05.440
Or Free Willy.
That looks even better.

1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:10.440
Jurassic Park by Steven Spielberg.
I think it's about dinosaurs.

1:11:10.480 --> 1:11:12.000
I've read the book.
Oh, it's fantastic.

1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:12.760
I've read the book.
Oh, it's fantastic.

1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:15.480
So, they find these mosquitos
that have been trapped in amber

1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:18.360
for, like, millions of years.
But before they died,

1:11:18.400 --> 1:11:20.000
the mosquitos had bitten dinosaurs
and had the dinosaur blood in them.

1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:21.840
the mosquitos had bitten dinosaurs
and had the dinosaur blood in them.

1:11:21.880 --> 1:11:24.240
So, they get the dinosaur
blood out of the mosquitos,

1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:26.880
they sequence the dino DNA
and then... No, no. Stop it.

1:11:26.920 --> 1:11:28.000
You're gonna spoil it for us.
Um...

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:29.040
You're gonna spoil it for us.
Um...

1:11:29.080 --> 1:11:33.240
So, what do we think? Do we
think it's going to be a hit?

1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:36.000
Are you joking, Mam?
Mam, it's going to be massive.

1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:36.240
Are you joking, Mam?
Mam, it's going to be massive.

1:11:36.280 --> 1:11:38.760
It'll be the biggest ever.
Liz, I'd pay to see it.

1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:44.000
Jurassic Park needs to be
the next film we show at the Lyric.

1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:44.640
Jurassic Park needs to be
the next film we show at the Lyric.

1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:47.280
How are we going to pull that off?

1:11:48.280 --> 1:11:50.640
Where's there's a will
there's a way.

1:12:38.640 --> 1:12:40.000
Mr Morgan.

1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:40.640
Mr Morgan.

1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:43.640
Dai Evans.

1:12:47.320 --> 1:12:48.000
Mr Morgan?

1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:49.320
Mr Morgan?

1:13:00.640 --> 1:13:02.640
Oh, there you are.

1:13:02.680 --> 1:13:04.000
I've got your film cans.

1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:04.680
I've got your film cans.

1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:06.720
I can't stay long,
the van's badly parked.

1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:10.800
Mr Morgan?

1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:15.320
Please, no. Mr Morgan.

1:13:23.840 --> 1:13:26.400
Because their words
had forked no lightning

1:13:27.400 --> 1:13:28.000
They do not go gentle
into that good night.

1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:30.680
They do not go gentle
into that good night.

1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:33.720
Good men, the last wave by...

1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:36.000
..crying how bright

1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:37.560
..crying how bright

1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:40.720
Their frail deeds might
have danced in a green bay

1:13:40.760 --> 1:13:44.000
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light.

1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:44.480
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light.

1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:49.280
Wild men who caught
and sang the sun in flight,

1:13:49.320 --> 1:13:52.000
And learn, too late,
they grieved it on its way

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.480
And learn, too late,
they grieved it on its way

1:13:55.840 --> 1:13:58.160
Do not go gentle
into that good night.

1:13:58.200 --> 1:14:00.000
You're sure they're all there?
Absolutely sure?

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.160
You're sure they're all there?
Absolutely sure?

1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:05.080
As far as I can tell. And you,
my father... Right. ..there.

1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:07.440
Susan.

1:14:07.480 --> 1:14:08.000
Get me Martyn O'Byrne on the phone.

1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:09.640
Get me Martyn O'Byrne on the phone.

1:14:14.320 --> 1:14:16.000
Putting him through on line one.

1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:16.320
Putting him through on line one.

1:14:16.360 --> 1:14:19.720
Martyn. It's empty.
Empty for how long?

1:14:19.760 --> 1:14:22.560
For however long
a funeral in Dryslwyn takes.

1:14:22.600 --> 1:14:24.000
It'll take the best part
of an hour to get the men

1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:24.480
It'll take the best part
of an hour to get the men

1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:27.240
and the heavy equipment there.
So do it.

1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:32.000
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light.

1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:35.080
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light.

1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:38.280
Now let us all join together

1:14:38.320 --> 1:14:40.000
to celebrate the life
of Hywel Morgan.

1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:40.320
to celebrate the life
of Hywel Morgan.

1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:45.280
First and foremost,
Mr Morgan was a teacher.

1:14:45.320 --> 1:14:47.880
He taught hundreds of boys
and girls in Carmarthen.

1:14:47.920 --> 1:14:48.000
I was one of them.
He inspired us all.

1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:51.160
I was one of them.
He inspired us all.

1:14:51.200 --> 1:14:54.000
The most important
thing he taught me,

1:14:54.040 --> 1:14:56.000
he taught all of us,
is that this place,

1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:56.120
he taught all of us,
is that this place,

1:14:56.160 --> 1:14:59.800
its history, its identity,
its culture, its people,

1:14:59.840 --> 1:15:03.400
makes us who we are,
makes us what we are.

1:15:03.440 --> 1:15:04.000
He's called the builders.
Who has? The mayor.

1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:05.960
He's called the builders.
Who has? The mayor.

1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:09.120
He said to bring
the heavy equipment. How long?

1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:12.000
Why do you care? How long
before they get to the Lyric?

1:15:12.040 --> 1:15:14.560
An hour.
But that was 30 minutes ago.

1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:18.000
We should all, every one of us,
be proud of our community...

1:15:18.040 --> 1:15:20.000
Let's go.
..and our heritage.

1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:20.040
Let's go.
..and our heritage.

1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:23.320
As this community is threatened,
now more than ever

1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:26.880
we need to honour his legacy
and continue his fight.

1:15:27.880 --> 1:15:28.000
With Hywel Morgan's passing,
it is our turn

1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:31.320
With Hywel Morgan's passing,
it is our turn

1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:33.720
to stand on the shoulders
of a giant of a man.

1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:36.000
it's our turn to save
the soul of our community.

1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:37.120
it's our turn to save
the soul of our community.

1:15:37.160 --> 1:15:41.000
It's our turn to rage
against the dying of the light.

1:15:42.040 --> 1:15:43.920
Come on, Dad. Go faster.

1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:44.000
We're not going to make it in time.
Come on.

1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:46.320
We're not going to make it in time.
Come on.

1:16:04.040 --> 1:16:06.080
Oi! Watch it!

1:16:07.480 --> 1:16:08.000
Ugh!
Oi!

1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:08.960
Ugh!
Oi!

1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:18.440
Stop him! Get off!

1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:20.760
Oi!
Ugh!

1:16:29.240 --> 1:16:31.600
Come on! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1:16:31.640 --> 1:16:32.000
I'm stopping you from doing
something that will affect

1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:33.840
I'm stopping you from doing
something that will affect

1:16:33.880 --> 1:16:36.320
the lives of everyone who
lives here. Councillor Goodridge.

1:16:36.360 --> 1:16:40.000
Get down from there. No! I'm not
letting you destroy the Lyric.

1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:40.480
Get down from there. No! I'm not
letting you destroy the Lyric.

1:16:40.520 --> 1:16:44.520
You voted for it, you clown!
It was a dreadful mistake.

1:16:44.560 --> 1:16:46.680
Listening to you,
I made a dreadful mistake.

1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:48.000
Get him down from there now. What
on earth are you doing up there?

1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:49.600
Get him down from there now. What
on earth are you doing up there?

1:16:49.640 --> 1:16:52.440
I don't know. But I'm part
of the town council now, so...

1:16:52.480 --> 1:16:55.600
I don't care.
It doesn't put you above the law.

1:16:55.640 --> 1:16:56.000
Tell that to bloody him.
If you don't move,

1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:58.400
Tell that to bloody him.
If you don't move,

1:16:58.440 --> 1:17:01.080
I'm going to have to arrest you.
Get him down! Get him down!

1:17:02.320 --> 1:17:04.000
I've had enough.

1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:04.320
I've had enough.

1:17:05.320 --> 1:17:08.120
Just swing the bloody thing.
Come on.

1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:17.080
Be my guest. You do not have
to say anything... There you go.

1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:19.760
..unless you wish to do so
but what you say

1:17:19.800 --> 1:17:20.000
may be given in evidence. You're
gonna have to arrest all of us,

1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:22.640
may be given in evidence. You're
gonna have to arrest all of us,

1:17:22.680 --> 1:17:25.360
starting with me.
Yeah, and me. And me.

1:17:25.400 --> 1:17:27.880
Come on, woman! Do your job.

1:17:27.920 --> 1:17:28.000
Arrest all of them. Arrest them!
Hello, Wendy.

1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:30.200
Arrest all of them. Arrest them!
Hello, Wendy.

1:17:32.120 --> 1:17:34.320
Minister.
Oh, Christ!

1:17:34.360 --> 1:17:36.000
On the subject of Christ,
our Saviour,

1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:37.040
On the subject of Christ,
our Saviour,

1:17:37.080 --> 1:17:39.920
you're going to have to
arrest me as well. Go on, Father.

1:17:39.960 --> 1:17:44.000
As mayor of Carmarthen,
I'm ordering you to do your job.

1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:44.400
As mayor of Carmarthen,
I'm ordering you to do your job.

1:17:44.440 --> 1:17:47.800
I don't work for you, Mayor Jenkins.

1:17:47.840 --> 1:17:50.120
I work for the people of Carmarthen.
Yeah.

1:17:50.160 --> 1:17:52.000
So do I. I don't think so.
I think you work for him.

1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:54.640
So do I. I don't think so.
I think you work for him.

1:17:54.680 --> 1:17:58.720
All right.
Right, you lot, Get this machine

1:17:58.760 --> 1:18:00.000
out of here now.
I don't want to see you here again

1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:01.360
out of here now.
I don't want to see you here again

1:18:01.400 --> 1:18:03.320
without a court order. Understand?

1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:05.680
This is ridiculous.
Ah! You tell him.

1:18:05.720 --> 1:18:07.360
Right, let's go. Come on!

1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:11.520
And I'm letting you
off with a warning.

1:18:13.720 --> 1:18:16.000
Pick a side and stick with it.

1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:16.520
Pick a side and stick with it.

1:18:16.560 --> 1:18:20.000
You're gonna get
a firmly worded letter from me!

1:18:20.040 --> 1:18:22.120
Let's go in the Lyric.
Brilliant.

1:18:22.160 --> 1:18:24.000
Cocktails for
everyone. Well done, Richard.

1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:26.920
Cocktails for
everyone. Well done, Richard.

1:18:29.160 --> 1:18:32.000
Well, it seems I misjudged you.
Go on. It was very brave of you

1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:33.400
Well, it seems I misjudged you.
Go on. It was very brave of you

1:18:33.440 --> 1:18:36.120
to jump on top of
a 10,000lb wrecking ball.

1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:39.600
Really? 10,000lb?
Oh, give or take.

1:18:39.640 --> 1:18:40.000
Oh! I just saw it and I couldn't
think of anything else to do.

1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:43.640
Oh! I just saw it and I couldn't
think of anything else to do.

1:18:43.680 --> 1:18:45.920
Well, it worked.
Yeah.

1:18:45.960 --> 1:18:47.960
But you know, um...

1:18:48.960 --> 1:18:51.160
..there is something
else you could do.

1:18:52.160 --> 1:18:56.000
I don't know the first
thing about being a bloody mayor.

1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:56.080
I don't know the first
thing about being a bloody mayor.

1:18:56.120 --> 1:18:58.120
But I do and I'll help you.

1:18:58.160 --> 1:19:00.840
You know, win or lose,

1:19:00.880 --> 1:19:03.800
you know, this could be
a platform to get our message out.

1:19:03.840 --> 1:19:04.000
It could be a game-changer.
All right. I need one of these

1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:07.080
It could be a game-changer.
All right. I need one of these

1:19:07.120 --> 1:19:09.320
to go through every letterbox
in Carmarthen, right?

1:19:09.360 --> 1:19:12.000
I can do that, can't I? No. You're
excused from postman duties today.

1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:13.120
I can do that, can't I? No. You're
excused from postman duties today.

1:19:13.160 --> 1:19:15.400
Instead, you are going down
to the Herald offices.

1:19:15.440 --> 1:19:17.440
Lynn's expecting you in 15 minutes.

1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:20.000
And then at three o'clock, BBC
Radio Wales want to interview you.

1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:21.040
And then at three o'clock, BBC
Radio Wales want to interview you.

1:19:21.080 --> 1:19:24.560
Interview?
Yeah. You'll be fine.

1:19:24.600 --> 1:19:28.000
Bloody Goodridge. This is absurd.

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:28.120
Bloody Goodridge. This is absurd.

1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:32.080
All I know is, there's thousands
of them in people's letterboxes,

1:19:32.120 --> 1:19:34.400
at lampposts, bus shelters.
All right, all right.

1:19:34.440 --> 1:19:36.000
I get the idea.
But he's not even on the ballot.

1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:36.880
I get the idea.
But he's not even on the ballot.

1:19:36.920 --> 1:19:39.720
There's a space where you can
write in a new candidate's name.

1:19:39.760 --> 1:19:43.920
Who's going to do that?
I also heard that Aled and Darek

1:19:43.960 --> 1:19:44.000
have withdrawn from the election
and they're supporting him.

1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:46.640
have withdrawn from the election
and they're supporting him.

1:19:46.680 --> 1:19:48.880
That's six votes for the
bloody idiot right there.

1:19:48.920 --> 1:19:51.880
I'm trembling. He's giving
interviews to the Herald.

1:19:51.920 --> 1:19:52.000
He's on the radio.

1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:53.920
He's on the radio.

1:19:53.960 --> 1:19:55.960
You need to respond.

1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:58.000
He's making this
all about the Lyric.

1:19:58.040 --> 1:20:00.000
Nobody cares about that old ruin.

1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:00.040
Nobody cares about that old ruin.

1:20:05.600 --> 1:20:08.000
Oh, morning, Liz.

1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:08.440
Oh, morning, Liz.

1:20:08.480 --> 1:20:12.920
All right, Susan? So, how's it
looking on the dinosaur front?

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:16.000
The distributor gave us a flat no.

1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:16.840
The distributor gave us a flat no.

1:20:16.880 --> 1:20:20.960
They won't give a copy to
a cinema that's to be demolished.

1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:24.000
Etcetera, etcetera. So I've
decided to go straight to the top.

1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:26.520
Etcetera, etcetera. So I've
decided to go straight to the top.

1:20:26.560 --> 1:20:28.600
Who's at the top?

1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:32.000
Dear Mr Spielberg.

1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:32.640
Dear Mr Spielberg.

1:20:32.680 --> 1:20:35.160
My name is Liz Evans

1:20:35.200 --> 1:20:38.600
and I run a youth theatre group
in Carmarthen, Wales.

1:20:38.640 --> 1:20:40.000
We put on our performances
in the Lyric,

1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:40.800
We put on our performances
in the Lyric,

1:20:40.840 --> 1:20:46.080
an art deco building that was
turned into a cinema in 1935.

1:20:46.120 --> 1:20:48.000
The town council, in its wisdom,
wants to knock down the building

1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:51.200
The town council, in its wisdom,
wants to knock down the building

1:20:51.240 --> 1:20:53.840
and replace it
with a shopping centre.

1:20:53.880 --> 1:20:56.000
Now, that's as far
as I've got for now.

1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:57.400
Now, that's as far
as I've got for now.

1:20:57.440 --> 1:21:00.480
But I'm going to go on and explain

1:21:00.520 --> 1:21:04.000
how showing Jurassic Park
will help save the Lyric. Oh!

1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:04.600
how showing Jurassic Park
will help save the Lyric. Oh!

1:21:04.640 --> 1:21:06.640
I've got some of
the mayor's stationery.

1:21:06.760 --> 1:21:10.080
It will look more official
if you send it on this.

1:21:10.120 --> 1:21:11.920
Oh!

1:21:11.960 --> 1:21:12.000
And then I'll intercept any
letters coming in from America.

1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:14.760
And then I'll intercept any
letters coming in from America.

1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:16.600
Marvellous

1:21:16.640 --> 1:21:18.320
On my rounds as a postman, every day

1:21:18.360 --> 1:21:20.000
people talk to me about
their issues, bin collection,

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:22.560
people talk to me about
their issues, bin collection,

1:21:22.600 --> 1:21:25.600
transport, parking, schools.

1:21:25.640 --> 1:21:28.000
Lots of them have ideas about how
to improve our lives in Carmarthen.

1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:28.840
Lots of them have ideas about how
to improve our lives in Carmarthen.

1:21:28.880 --> 1:21:31.320
Now, if I'm elected mayor,

1:21:31.360 --> 1:21:33.800
my most important job
will be to listen to them.

1:21:33.840 --> 1:21:35.840
Every single one of them.

1:21:35.880 --> 1:21:36.000
He's a natural.

1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:38.360
He's a natural.

1:21:38.400 --> 1:21:40.680
It's still odds on
for Tom to win, mind.

1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:43.680
So we've got to get everyone
we can out to vote.

1:21:43.720 --> 1:21:44.000
Radio...

1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:45.720
Radio...

1:21:48.840 --> 1:21:51.240
A lot of people have
read about your heroics

1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:52.000
in the campaign to save the Lyric
Theatre. I'm not sure how heroic...

1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:54.440
in the campaign to save the Lyric
Theatre. I'm not sure how heroic...

1:21:54.480 --> 1:21:57.040
Richard Goodridge is just a postman.

1:21:57.080 --> 1:21:59.480
Yes? I'm there.

1:21:59.520 --> 1:22:00.000
Thank you. The real hero is Liz
Evans who put her life on hold

1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:03.560
Thank you. The real hero is Liz
Evans who put her life on hold

1:22:03.600 --> 1:22:07.000
to lead the campaign.
I'm very proud of my community.

1:22:07.040 --> 1:22:08.000
We're both very proud
of its history.

1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:09.080
We're both very proud
of its history.

1:22:09.120 --> 1:22:11.240
Listen. We all need to be clear
that it's not for sale.

1:22:11.280 --> 1:22:13.760
Not at any price.

1:22:38.200 --> 1:22:40.000
You all right?

1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:40.200
You all right?

1:22:42.240 --> 1:22:44.720
Still nothing from Mr Spielberg.

1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:48.000
I'm sure he's busy
promoting his new film.

1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:49.480
I'm sure he's busy
promoting his new film.

1:22:49.520 --> 1:22:51.960
Besides, it's only
been a couple of months.

1:22:58.120 --> 1:23:02.280
If we can't find a way
to get people to come here again

1:23:02.320 --> 1:23:04.000
and start spending money...

1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:04.320
and start spending money...

1:23:05.320 --> 1:23:07.320
..I don't know what I'm going to do.

1:23:08.520 --> 1:23:10.520
Hey.

1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:12.000
Hey, like you say, Liz, yeah?

1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.000
Hey, like you say, Liz, yeah?

1:23:15.080 --> 1:23:17.840
Where there's a will there's a way.

1:23:17.880 --> 1:23:20.000
Hey! Look at what
you've achieved so far.

1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:21.560
Hey! Look at what
you've achieved so far.

1:23:21.600 --> 1:23:23.760
Some of those people
here the other night,

1:23:23.800 --> 1:23:26.720
they hadn't left
their house for weeks.

1:23:26.760 --> 1:23:28.000
They hadn't seen
each other in years.

1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:29.280
They hadn't seen
each other in years.

1:23:29.320 --> 1:23:32.680
You brought them back together.

1:23:35.080 --> 1:23:36.000
The Lyric is important.

1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:37.480
The Lyric is important.

1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:42.920
And you will find
a way to keep it going,

1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:44.000
right?

1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:44.880
right?

1:23:44.920 --> 1:23:46.880
Right.

1:23:46.920 --> 1:23:50.120
Now get out there and vote.

1:23:50.160 --> 1:23:52.000
I want to see the look
on Tom Jenkins's face

1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:52.480
I want to see the look
on Tom Jenkins's face

1:23:52.520 --> 1:23:54.520
when he's booted out of his office.

1:23:54.560 --> 1:23:57.800
All right.
Thank you.

1:23:57.840 --> 1:23:59.840
You're very welcome.

1:23:59.880 --> 1:24:00.000
We need you. Chin up.

1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.320
We need you. Chin up.

1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:08.000
Darlene, will you go and
get me a whisky and Babycham?

1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:11.440
Darlene, will you go and
get me a whisky and Babycham?

1:24:11.480 --> 1:24:13.480
Ohh! Coming up.

1:24:13.520 --> 1:24:15.760
A double. Do you want one as well?
Do you fancy one.

1:24:15.800 --> 1:24:16.000
I'll have one. Why not?
Yes, come on. Let's go.

1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.640
I'll have one. Why not?
Yes, come on. Let's go.

1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:32.000
As clerk of the town council,
I declare that in the election

1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:33.080

Recount!

1:25:18.280 --> 1:25:20.000
Call for you on line one.

1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:20.760
Call for you on line one.

1:25:22.560 --> 1:25:24.040
Thank you.

1:25:24.080 --> 1:25:26.080
Right.

1:25:27.920 --> 1:25:28.000
Hello. Mayor Goodridge.

1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:30.480
Hello. Mayor Goodridge.

1:25:32.600 --> 1:25:34.720
Mayor Goodridge.

Let it ring.

1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:37.600
Let it ring.

1:25:37.640 --> 1:25:39.680

This is Jennifer Costas from

Amblin Pictures in Los Angeles.

1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:52.000
Hello? Right. Good.
Hi. Hello.

1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:52.120
Hello? Right. Good.
Hi. Hello.

1:25:52.160 --> 1:25:54.760
I'm calling about the Lyric Theatre.

1:25:54.800 --> 1:25:58.400
I passed on the letter that you
and Mrs Evans wrote to Mr Spielberg.

1:25:58.440 --> 1:26:00.000
And I just thought I would call you
myself and relay the information.

1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.440
And I just thought I would call you
myself and relay the information.

1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:06.080
Thank you. It's not every day
I can call a real live mayor.

1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:08.000
Mr Mayor. Yes. That's me. Yes.
Mayor of Carmarthen, Wales.

1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.720
Mr Mayor. Yes. That's me. Yes.
Mayor of Carmarthen, Wales.

1:26:10.760 --> 1:26:13.760
Carmarthen, Wales.
It sounds so romantic.

1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:15.760
Where in the world is it?

1:26:15.800 --> 1:26:16.000
It's in Wales.

1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.400
It's in Wales.

1:26:18.440 --> 1:26:21.120
Oh, yes, of course.
I'm sure it's very beautiful.

1:26:21.160 --> 1:26:24.000
Listen, are you and Mrs Evans
free to speak in an hour?

1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:24.080
Listen, are you and Mrs Evans
free to speak in an hour?

1:26:24.120 --> 1:26:26.720
Free in an hour? I don't think...
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1:26:26.760 --> 1:26:28.760
Yes, yes. Great.
Yes, we are, yes. Great.

1:26:28.800 --> 1:26:30.920
I'll speak to you in an hour then.
Bye-bye.

1:26:30.960 --> 1:26:32.000
Unbelievable.

1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:33.600
Unbelievable.

1:26:40.920 --> 1:26:42.920
I'm coming.

1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:46.120
Scissors and Combs. Dolly speaking.

1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:51.120
Are you having me on?

1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:54.200
You're joking.

1:26:55.480 --> 1:26:56.000
Er... Er... All right.

1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:57.920
Er... Er... All right.

1:26:57.960 --> 1:26:59.960
Er, she'll be there.

1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.000
OK. Bye.

1:27:07.600 --> 1:27:09.600
Liz. Liz!

1:27:09.640 --> 1:27:11.640
It's him.

1:27:11.680 --> 1:27:12.000
Who?

1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:13.680
Who?

1:27:13.720 --> 1:27:15.600
Steven Spielberg.

1:27:15.640 --> 1:27:18.840
What?
Steven Spielberg on the phone.

1:27:18.880 --> 1:27:20.000
Don't be daft. He's not going
to be calling us on a payphone.

1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:21.600
Don't be daft. He's not going
to be calling us on a payphone.

1:27:21.640 --> 1:27:25.440
No. He's calling the mayor's
office in half an hour.

1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:28.000
Now, hang on. What about my hair?
This is peroxide.

1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:28.560
Now, hang on. What about my hair?
This is peroxide.

1:27:28.600 --> 1:27:31.320
Oh, I can have a go.
No offence, Dolly,

1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:34.240
but there's only one woman who
does my hair and it's Elizabeth.

1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:52.000
OK. Stay calm, stay calm.

1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:52.520
OK. Stay calm, stay calm.

1:27:57.880 --> 1:27:59.880
Hello. Mayor Goodridge.

1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:00.000
This is Steven Spielberg.
It's a pleasure to speak to you.

1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.640
This is Steven Spielberg.
It's a pleasure to speak to you.

1:28:02.680 --> 1:28:04.560
It's a pleasure to speak to you too.

1:28:04.600 --> 1:28:07.480
But you should be speaking with
Liz Evans. She's the one leading

1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:08.000
the campaign to try and save the
Lyric Theatre. Shall I call back?

1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.240
the campaign to try and save the
Lyric Theatre. Shall I call back?

1:28:10.280 --> 1:28:12.280
No, she's right here.

1:28:13.280 --> 1:28:15.520
I'll pass you over to her now. OK.

1:28:23.600 --> 1:28:24.000
Hello. This is Liz Evans.

1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.440
Hello. This is Liz Evans.

1:28:26.480 --> 1:28:29.840
Mrs Evans, it sounds like you're
in the middle of a hell of a fight.

1:28:29.880 --> 1:28:31.800
I am.

1:28:31.840 --> 1:28:32.000
Can you believe
they want to knock down

1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:33.920
Can you believe
they want to knock down

1:28:33.960 --> 1:28:36.640
an art deco building
and put up a shopping centre?

1:28:37.960 --> 1:28:40.000
So, you want Jurassic Park?
Yes, please, Mr Spielberg.

1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:41.440
So, you want Jurassic Park?
Yes, please, Mr Spielberg.

1:28:41.480 --> 1:28:45.520
I think showing your new film
would really help save the Lyric.

1:28:45.560 --> 1:28:47.600
It would be tremendous.

1:28:53.680 --> 1:28:56.000
What I'm going to do is, I'm going
to send you my personal copy

1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:56.400
What I'm going to do is, I'm going
to send you my personal copy

1:28:56.440 --> 1:29:00.400
and you can out it on three minutes
after the London premiere starts.

1:29:00.440 --> 1:29:02.440
How's that?

1:29:02.480 --> 1:29:04.000
Oh, my God! I...

1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:04.480
Oh, my God! I...

1:29:04.520 --> 1:29:06.400
It doesn't seem real. I...

1:29:06.440 --> 1:29:08.480
I don't know what to say. Er...

1:29:08.520 --> 1:29:11.640
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much, Mr Spielberg.

1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:12.000
Good luck saving your theatre.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:13.760
Good luck saving your theatre.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

1:29:13.800 --> 1:29:15.800
Thanks. Goodbye, Mrs Evans.

1:29:15.840 --> 1:29:19.120
Oh, my God! He's gonna give
us the film. You're joking.

1:29:19.160 --> 1:29:20.000
He's going to give us the film!

1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:20.600
He's going to give us the film!

1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:33.960
Well?
You look great. Amazing.

1:29:35.560 --> 1:29:36.000
I feel a bit of a...
No, no.

1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:37.640
I feel a bit of a...
No, no.

1:29:37.680 --> 1:29:40.360
Honestly.
Are you sure? Really handsome.

1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:43.600
Your hat.

1:29:43.640 --> 1:29:44.000
No. Just carry it.

1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:45.800
No. Just carry it.

1:29:45.840 --> 1:29:47.840
OK. OK.

1:29:51.880 --> 1:29:52.000
Shall we?

1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:53.880
Shall we?

1:29:53.920 --> 1:29:56.320
Let's.
Knock 'em dead.

1:29:56.360 --> 1:29:58.640
OK.

1:29:58.680 --> 1:30:00.000
Mayor Goodridge.

1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:00.680
Mayor Goodridge.

1:30:00.720 --> 1:30:01.920
Mayor Goodridge.

1:30:01.960 --> 1:30:05.200
Good afternoon. Can you
tell us what we're going to see?

1:30:05.240 --> 1:30:07.960
Enough now. Quiet.
There she is. Look, look.

1:30:10.480 --> 1:30:13.040
You look beautiful there.
I couldn't believe it.

1:30:13.080 --> 1:30:16.000
I thought that Richard and
Dolly were playing a joke on me.

1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:16.720
I thought that Richard and
Dolly were playing a joke on me.

1:30:16.760 --> 1:30:20.600
It really was him,
it was Steven Spielberg.

1:30:20.640 --> 1:30:24.000
He's giving the Lyric his
personal copy of his new film.

1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:24.080
He's giving the Lyric his
personal copy of his new film.

1:30:24.120 --> 1:30:27.600
Liz, thanks very much. Love you.
And it's back to you in the studio.

1:30:27.640 --> 1:30:30.000
Back to studio! Well done, Mam.

1:30:30.040 --> 1:30:32.000
Well done, Mam. That was good.

1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:33.120
Well done, Mam. That was good.

1:30:33.160 --> 1:30:38.080
Hiya. Hi, Susan. I found a few of
these in storage in the town hall.

1:30:38.120 --> 1:30:40.000
They're from when Prince Charles
visited ten years ago,

1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:40.360
They're from when Prince Charles
visited ten years ago,

1:30:40.400 --> 1:30:43.320
do you remember? Yeah. Anyway, I
thought we might be able to sue them

1:30:43.360 --> 1:30:45.240
at the premiere.
Yeh! It's going to be great.

1:30:45.280 --> 1:30:48.000
Is anyone famous coming? No, but
because it's a people's premiere,

1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:49.680
Is anyone famous coming? No, but
because it's a people's premiere,

1:30:49.720 --> 1:30:51.800
why don't we all just
pretend to be celebrities?

1:30:51.840 --> 1:30:53.520
All right. Get to school now.
Come on.

1:30:53.560 --> 1:30:56.000
Oh! Got to go, man.
Give us one of those crisps.

1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:56.720
Oh! Got to go, man.
Give us one of those crisps.

1:30:56.760 --> 1:30:59.160
No, Wynne. How's Richard?

1:30:59.200 --> 1:31:01.640
Oh, he's great.
He's on his way to London.

1:31:01.680 --> 1:31:04.000
Channel 4 were so impressed
with his interviews yesterday

1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:04.400
Channel 4 were so impressed
with his interviews yesterday

1:31:04.440 --> 1:31:06.240
they asked him to be
on the Big Breakfast.

1:31:06.280 --> 1:31:08.640
No. No.
He's going to be in bed?

1:31:08.680 --> 1:31:10.800
What? No. They're
interviewing him. Yeah.

1:31:10.840 --> 1:31:12.000
That's how they do it
on the Big Breakfast. Yeah.

1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:12.840
That's how they do it
on the Big Breakfast. Yeah.

1:31:12.880 --> 1:31:14.880
The guests get into
bed with the presenter

1:31:14.920 --> 1:31:18.520
and she asks them questions.
Are you having me on? No. No.

1:31:18.560 --> 1:31:20.000
Oh, yes. Give me those
crisps. You should pop by tomorrow

1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:22.120
Oh, yes. Give me those
crisps. You should pop by tomorrow

1:31:22.160 --> 1:31:25.440
and we'll watch it together
in the morning. All right.

1:31:41.400 --> 1:31:44.000
I don't think we've ever had
a real live mayor in bed before.

1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:44.720
I don't think we've ever had
a real live mayor in bed before.

1:31:44.760 --> 1:31:46.760
I'm just yanking your chain.

1:31:48.520 --> 1:31:51.640
She's flirting with him.
Is it real gold? Mm-hm!

1:31:51.680 --> 1:31:52.000
That's how they do it on the show.

1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:53.520
That's how they do it on the show.

1:31:53.560 --> 1:31:57.560
So you talked to Steven Spielberg?
Yes, just for a moment.

1:31:57.600 --> 1:32:00.000
Then I passed him onto Liz Evans,
she's the one leading the campaign

1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:01.240
Then I passed him onto Liz Evans,
she's the one leading the campaign

1:32:01.280 --> 1:32:03.640
to save the
Lyric Theatre in Carmarthen.

1:32:03.680 --> 1:32:07.640
It's her passion and her energy
that really got, er...

1:32:07.680 --> 1:32:08.000
got Steven behind
the project at all.

1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:10.200
got Steven behind
the project at all.

1:32:10.240 --> 1:32:12.640
Passion and energy.
I like the sound of that.

1:32:13.640 --> 1:32:16.000
What is it? Or should I ask who is
it you're passionate about, Richard?

1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:17.320
What is it? Or should I ask who is
it you're passionate about, Richard?

1:32:21.440 --> 1:32:23.440
I think...

1:32:23.480 --> 1:32:24.000
I hope... they know who they are.

1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:27.440
I hope... they know who they are.

1:32:27.480 --> 1:32:29.480
That was Richard Goodridge.

1:32:29.520 --> 1:32:32.000
Carmarthen's newest sexy mayor.

1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:32.240
Carmarthen's newest sexy mayor.

1:32:32.280 --> 1:32:34.520
What? See you after the break.

1:32:34.560 --> 1:32:37.160
Richard. Richard!

1:32:39.520 --> 1:32:40.000
Hello. Hello.
There he is.

1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:41.520
Hello. Hello.
There he is.

1:32:41.560 --> 1:32:43.680
Thank you. Our local star.
You saw it then?

1:32:43.720 --> 1:32:46.400
Yeah, it was brilliant.
Ah! Thank you. Thank you.

1:32:46.440 --> 1:32:48.000
It was one of the strangest
experiences of my life

1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:48.800
It was one of the strangest
experiences of my life

1:32:48.840 --> 1:32:50.880
but I think I said everything
I wanted to for sure.

1:32:50.920 --> 1:32:53.600
You were great this morning. Thank
you. You really were. Thank you.

1:32:53.640 --> 1:32:56.000
The place looks amazing.
Oh! Speaking of which.

1:32:56.000 --> 1:32:56.040
The place looks amazing.
Oh! Speaking of which.

1:32:56.080 --> 1:32:59.960
Boys! Look what
I've got from London.

1:33:03.680 --> 1:33:04.000
What are they?
Massive inflatable dinosaurs.

1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:06.960
What are they?
Massive inflatable dinosaurs.

1:33:07.000 --> 1:33:09.960
Thanks. Whoa! Thank you.

1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:12.000
Oh!

1:33:13.440 --> 1:33:15.680
Hiya.
Hey! Hello.

1:33:15.720 --> 1:33:18.720
How's the um... the office?

1:33:18.760 --> 1:33:20.000
Everything's under control.
Lovely.

1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:21.600
Everything's under control.
Lovely.

1:33:21.640 --> 1:33:24.760
Hmm! Do you remember, um...?
Do you remember

1:33:24.800 --> 1:33:27.160
asking whether I'd like to go
for a drink with you sometime?

1:33:27.200 --> 1:33:28.000
Yeah. Well, I've
thought about it some more.

1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:30.200
Yeah. Well, I've
thought about it some more.

1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:32.160
And I've decided I would.

1:33:33.400 --> 1:33:35.400
You would?
Mm!

1:33:35.440 --> 1:33:36.000
Well, fantastic.

1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:37.440
Well, fantastic.

1:33:37.480 --> 1:33:39.640
Um... When?

1:33:39.680 --> 1:33:42.080
Now.
Now? Now?

1:33:42.120 --> 1:33:43.800
Look.

1:33:43.840 --> 1:33:44.000
Susan.

1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:45.840
Susan.

1:33:45.880 --> 1:33:47.920
Hi. Hi. That looks good.
Thank you. Hello.

1:33:47.960 --> 1:33:52.000
Now, get these down you
and tell me what you think.

1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:52.080
Now, get these down you
and tell me what you think.

1:33:52.120 --> 1:33:54.120
Oh, OK. Can I ask what it is?

1:33:54.160 --> 1:33:57.000
You can. So, for this occasion,

1:33:57.040 --> 1:34:00.000
I've invented a range
of prehistoric cocktails. Uh-huh!

1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:00.600
I've invented a range
of prehistoric cocktails. Uh-huh!

1:34:00.640 --> 1:34:03.120
This is a T-Rextacy.
Clever.

1:34:03.160 --> 1:34:05.960
And that is a Velicirapture.
Right.

1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:08.000
And what's in it?
You don't want to know.

1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:08.960
And what's in it?
You don't want to know.

1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:12.360
Go on!
OK, well, iechyd da. Yes.

1:34:12.400 --> 1:34:15.520
Oh, hang on.

1:34:18.080 --> 1:34:21.280
I, er...
Oh, that's strong.

1:34:21.320 --> 1:34:23.840
Oh, it's lovely.
No, it's lovely. Smashing.

1:34:23.880 --> 1:34:24.000
I'll... I'll be back there.

1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:26.360
I'll... I'll be back there.

1:34:30.440 --> 1:34:32.000
I, er... I wasn't sure you, er...

1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:33.360

1:34:33.400 --> 1:34:35.520
If you saw the, er...

1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:37.480
My, er, hold...

1:35:09.520 --> 1:35:12.000
Well, they promised me a limo
but I've ended up in this.

1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:12.520
Well, they promised me a limo
but I've ended up in this.

1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:15.960
Good afternoon to you. Now, minutes
after the premiere in London,

1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:18.600
the people of Carmarthen
are about to enjoy

1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:20.000
one of the first screenings
of Steven Spielberg's

1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:21.240
one of the first screenings
of Steven Spielberg's

1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:23.280
Jurassic Park.

1:35:23.320 --> 1:35:27.760
You join me right
in the heart of Carmarthen...

1:35:27.800 --> 1:35:28.000
Here in Carmarthen, there are no
freebies for the rich and famous.

1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:32.560
Here in Carmarthen, there are no
freebies for the rich and famous.

1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:35.240
Everyone has got to buy
their own ticket. The cost?

1:35:35.280 --> 1:35:36.000
£2.50 or half price for children.

1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:37.480
£2.50 or half price for children.

1:35:37.520 --> 1:35:39.800
Doesn't seem to have stopped
anybody coming out, though.

1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:42.160
Let's have a word with a few
of them. Who have we got here?

1:35:42.200 --> 1:35:44.000
Hello. And you are?
Hello. I'm Mavis, Mavis Jones.

1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:44.600
Hello. And you are?
Hello. I'm Mavis, Mavis Jones.

1:35:44.640 --> 1:35:46.640
And, Mavis, do you
live in Carmarthen?

1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:50.200
Yes, I've lived here all my life.
I work in Tesco's on Pensarn Road.

1:35:50.240 --> 1:35:52.000
And are you looking
forward to seeing the film?

1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:52.240
And are you looking
forward to seeing the film?

1:35:52.280 --> 1:35:54.640
Yes, very much so. Steven Spielberg.

1:35:54.680 --> 1:35:56.840
So, Mavis, enjoy the film.
Thank you. And with that,

1:35:56.880 --> 1:35:58.880
it's back to you in the studio.

1:36:00.480 --> 1:36:02.840
The combination of Princess Diana

1:36:02.880 --> 1:36:05.560
and dinosaurs is obviously dynamite.

1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:08.000
So Leicester Square came to
a complete halt this evening

1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:08.360
So Leicester Square came to
a complete halt this evening

1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:12.200
as, inside, the Princess of Wales
greeted Sir Richard Attenborough

1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:14.240
who plays the owner
of Jurassic Park.

1:36:14.280 --> 1:36:16.000
Steven Spielberg himself has
suggested that children under 13

1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:17.920
Steven Spielberg himself has
suggested that children under 13

1:36:17.960 --> 1:36:21.920
shouldn't be allowed to see what
some have called Jaws With Claws.

1:36:21.960 --> 1:36:24.000
Oh, yeah. We've got all
the bigwigs in tonight.

1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:24.240
Oh, yeah. We've got all
the bigwigs in tonight.

1:36:24.280 --> 1:36:27.120
Oh, thank you so much for coming.

1:36:27.160 --> 1:36:30.800
- We're going to sit down now.
- I've got an idea.

1:36:35.560 --> 1:36:38.640
Dave, it's only right
that the people of Carmarthen

1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:40.000
should see Jurassic Park first.
Right. Not the London people.

1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:41.680
should see Jurassic Park first.
Right. Not the London people.

1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:43.840
So, what are you thinking?
Us.

1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:48.000
Go on.

1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:48.480
Go on.

1:36:48.520 --> 1:36:50.200
There.

1:36:50.240 --> 1:36:52.480
Yes!
Come on.

1:36:52.520 --> 1:36:55.080
The townsfolk in
Carmarthen in North Wales

1:36:55.120 --> 1:36:56.000
say nothing ever happens
in their town

1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:57.440
say nothing ever happens
in their town

1:36:57.480 --> 1:36:59.920
and their theatre never gets
new films like Jurassic Park.

1:36:59.960 --> 1:37:01.880
But this year, they took a stand.

1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:04.000
They appealed directly
to director Steven Spielberg,

1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:04.200
They appealed directly
to director Steven Spielberg,

1:37:04.240 --> 1:37:06.840
who arranged to have the film
make its debut in Wales

1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:08.840
in their humble hamlet
and it worked.

1:37:08.880 --> 1:37:11.840
Spielberg cut through the red tape
and arranged to get the theatre

1:37:11.880 --> 1:37:12.000
a print of the film
for the premiere.

1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:13.720
a print of the film
for the premiere.

1:37:13.760 --> 1:37:16.280
It's a story with a happy ending.
Residents say

1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:19.120
it is the most exciting
thing to happen in years.

1:37:21.160 --> 1:37:24.360
Right. Let's go to a premiere.

1:37:35.720 --> 1:37:36.000
We did it.

1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:37.720
We did it.
