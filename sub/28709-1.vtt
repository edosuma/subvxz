Hi,

01:05.880 --> 01:08.005
Daddy and I working late
at the store again.

01:08.088 --> 01:10.921
Make yourself dinner and don't watch TV!

01:37.421 --> 01:39.546
...decided what you're gonna do
for your anniversary?

01:39.630 --> 01:41.005
Oh, I don't know, Clarissa.

01:41.088 --> 01:42.296
It's been so busy lately.

01:42.380 --> 01:44.213
I wouldn't mind a nice, quiet evening
at home.

01:45.255 --> 01:47.255
Well, it'd be nice
to do something special.

01:47.338 --> 01:50.171
- What did you have in mind?
- I don't know.

01:51.130 --> 01:52.088
You want some soup?

01:52.171 --> 01:53.671
My mom said to ask

01:53.755 --> 01:56.046
if you wanted some soup.
She makes way too much,

01:56.130 --> 01:58.380
then I have to bring the leftovers
to school in a thermos.

01:58.713 --> 02:01.213
Nobody wants to sit next to that kid
with the thermos soup.

02:01.630 --> 02:03.463
Only the other kids with the thermos soup.

02:03.546 --> 02:05.296
And I don't want to sit
next to those losers!

02:10.920 --> 02:11.755
Just kidding.

02:12.005 --> 02:13.255
What if I really did that?

02:13.338 --> 02:14.796
I thought you just did that.

02:14.880 --> 02:17.046
I thought you just shut the door
in my face.

02:17.130 --> 02:18.546
I did, to be funny.

02:18.880 --> 02:21.255
I so wouldn't have done that.
You're, like, my best friend.

02:21.338 --> 02:22.338
Okay, bestie.

02:22.421 --> 02:25.046
And by the way, I'd sit
next to you if you had thermos soup.

02:25.130 --> 02:26.630
I can't believe it.

02:26.713 --> 02:30.255
So glad you said that, though.
It made the joke way better.

02:31.130 --> 02:33.671
Mom! No more thermos soup for me!

02:34.046 --> 02:35.921
Look at that.
Doesn't that look amazing?

02:36.005 --> 02:38.088
It looks super amazing.

02:38.171 --> 02:40.213
Kimchi-jjigae is very simple,

02:40.796 --> 02:42.255
but that's what makes it so good.

02:42.338 --> 02:44.380
It's about using the best ingredients.

02:44.463 --> 02:46.588
It smells so good, Mrs. Kim.

02:46.671 --> 02:48.588
Sasha, I've told you a million times,

02:48.671 --> 02:50.630
call me Judy.

02:50.713 --> 02:54.505
And we Koreans use scissors
for everything.

02:54.588 --> 02:56.046
Vegetables, noodles...

02:56.130 --> 02:57.296
Our children.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.255
- All right. You wanna try?
- Okay.

03:02.838 --> 03:04.838
Look at you. You're a natural.

03:04.921 --> 03:07.255
Thanks... Judy.

03:08.838 --> 03:10.713
Are you sure you're not Korean?

03:12.088 --> 03:14.713
So I'm painting a sparrow
in its nest,

03:14.838 --> 03:17.171
and I finished painting the nest,

03:17.255 --> 03:18.921
and halfway through painting the sparrow,

03:19.130 --> 03:20.213
it flies away.

03:21.046 --> 03:22.380
That's when I learned...

03:22.588 --> 03:24.546
to start with the thing that can fly away.

03:27.796 --> 03:31.088
- Can I have some money?
- Why?

03:31.171 --> 03:34.255

08:52.546 --> 08:55.338
taught us, like, sex ed for a day, and...

10:05.088 --> 10:06.713

10:06.796 --> 10:08.963
Look, it was your idea to go all the way,
all right?

10:09.046 --> 10:10.130
Are you kidding me?

10:10.671 --> 10:12.588
You kissed me with tongue.

10:12.671 --> 10:14.921
You took off my underwear.
You took it to the next step.

10:15.005 --> 10:18.130

everyone at college that you're a virgin.

10:18.213 --> 10:20.130
Well, I was planning to lie about that.

10:20.588 --> 10:22.546

10:30.588 --> 10:31.796

10:32.421 --> 10:34.671
I-- I know that you're hurting

10:34.755 --> 10:37.421
- You know, I lost her too--
- But she wasn't your mom!

10:37.671 --> 10:39.671
Was she? She was my mom!

10:40.463 --> 10:43.880
Just because you're always at our house,
eating our food, watching our TV

10:43.963 --> 10:46.463
because your parents don't care enough
to ever be around

10:46.546 --> 10:48.463

12:02.796 --> 12:05.671
Uh, San Francisco, you're opening
a new restaurant in two months,

12:05.755 --> 12:07.880
and I need you there
by the end of this week, permanently.

12:07.963 --> 12:10.255
- That's beautiful, Sharice.
- I ordered you guys a great house.

12:10.338 --> 12:11.171
Oh, sounds good.

12:11.255 --> 12:12.838
Your mom wants to pick you up

12:12.921 --> 12:14.130
I told her I'd get you a car,

12:14.213 --> 12:16.046

- Oh.

12:16.380 --> 12:19.088
Their worst fear in life is for me
to have to tip somebody.

12:19.171 --> 12:20.755

12:37.588 --> 12:39.213
And I am so mad at Kate Middleton.

12:39.588 --> 12:42.213
I was driving to work this morning
thinking about her taking those pictures

12:42.296 --> 12:45.171
on the hospital steps like, what,
three hours after she had a baby?

12:45.255 --> 12:48.296
And she had that royal diaper on.
You know she had that diaper on.

12:48.380 --> 12:49.713
I don't want you to talk about that stuff

12:49.796 --> 12:51.421
- in front of the customers.
- Okay, cool.

12:51.505 --> 12:53.838
- You asked me a question. What's it again?
- Hey.

12:54.421 --> 12:56.130
- Hey.
- Mm.

12:56.463 --> 12:59.296
- Wow, you look great.
- Oh...

12:59.380 --> 13:00.630
- Ready to do this?
- Yes.

13:00.713 --> 13:01.671
Guys, enjoy yourselves.

13:01.755 --> 13:05.130
I'll just be here
looking like a fat Meghan Markle.

13:05.213 --> 13:06.713
We are

13:06.796 --> 13:07.921
at the Operation Smile benefit,

13:08.005 --> 13:10.380
catching up
with celebrity chef Sasha Tran,

13:10.463 --> 13:12.838
the genius
behind LA's trendsetting restaurant,

13:12.921 --> 13:13.838
Knives and Mercy,

13:13.921 --> 13:16.713
and her fiancé
and mega restaurant developer,

13:16.796 --> 13:17.963
Brandon Choi.

13:18.046 --> 13:19.671
Now Brandon, you're credited

13:19.755 --> 13:24.255
with the global branding and franchising
for a lot of A-list culinary stars.

13:24.338 --> 13:27.880
Do they ever get jealous
that Sasha is receiving special treatment?

13:28.213 --> 13:30.088
Well,
I hope they're all a little bit jealous,

13:30.380 --> 13:32.671
but not jealous enough
to stop working with me.

13:32.755 --> 13:35.046
What an amazing couple you two are.

13:36.088 --> 13:37.463
So sweet.

13:43.171 --> 13:45.130
What a great cause, huh?

13:45.505 --> 13:47.213
Hmm.

13:51.255 --> 13:54.046

- I challenge you to a battle.
- Well, since you put it that way.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.880
Oh, okay, stop, stop. You win the battle.

15:08.671 --> 15:11.421
another hipster donut shop opening
in an old laundromat?

15:11.796 --> 15:12.671
No.

15:12.838 --> 15:16.046
Artisan roast beef sandwiches
in an old record store.

15:16.130 --> 15:18.130
Unbelievable.

15:19.046 --> 15:22.338
Hey! Hey, what do you think about this
for the flowers for the wedding, huh?

15:23.046 --> 15:26.171
I'll do for black flowers
what I did for fish sauce ice cream.

15:27.380 --> 15:28.713
- Sure.
- Good.

15:28.796 --> 15:30.755
I just don't wanna be a boring-ass bride,
you know?

15:30.838 --> 15:32.546
- Let's spice it up.
- Can I talk to you about something?

15:33.088 --> 15:36.546
Yeah. Sure. What's up? Mm-hmm.

15:38.213 --> 15:39.838
I've been thinking about this a lot.

15:39.921 --> 15:42.130
And if it's cool with you,
I'd like to postpone the wedding.

15:43.463 --> 15:45.505
It's not that I don't want to get married.
I do.

15:46.338 --> 15:48.380
It's just-- It's just
that this opportunity has come up

15:48.463 --> 15:51.338
for me to go to India with José Andrés.

15:51.838 --> 15:53.005
The chef from Bazaar?

15:53.880 --> 15:54.713
Exactly.

15:55.296 --> 15:58.421
He's opening up a new restaurant there,
and he knows about my two years

15:58.505 --> 16:00.921
in the saffron fields of Kashmir
with Alice Waters.

16:01.630 --> 16:03.880
So you want me
to go to San Francisco alone?

16:03.963 --> 16:05.130
That's the beauty of it.

16:05.213 --> 16:07.880
We'd both be in new surroundings.
We'd be apart...

16:08.630 --> 16:09.588
together.

16:10.005 --> 16:12.296
Before entering
into a lifelong commitment.

16:12.380 --> 16:16.505
I just-- I just want this to be right.
So that when we do get married...

16:16.588 --> 16:19.671
...he'll be the best husband he can be.
So, in that sense,

16:20.046 --> 16:21.338
it's really for the both of us.

16:21.421 --> 16:23.213
Are you serious?
What the hell is happening right now?

16:23.296 --> 16:25.296
- He'll just be gone for half a year--
- Stop it.

16:25.380 --> 16:28.380
- And he flew out this morning to India.
- Like, the India? Like, the...

16:28.838 --> 16:30.213
- the country?
- India.

16:30.296 --> 16:33.505
So instead of getting married,
he's gonna, like, just Eat Pray Love?

16:33.588 --> 16:35.921
And in the meantime,
we're gonna see other people.

16:36.005 --> 16:37.130
Wait, what?

16:37.213 --> 16:39.088
We are gonna see other people.

16:39.171 --> 16:41.380
So we're both absolutely sure
that we belong together.

16:41.713 --> 16:43.880
Think of it like a six-month Bachelorette.

16:43.963 --> 16:46.630
You know? San Francisco
could not have come at a better time.

16:46.713 --> 16:48.588
I'll get away, reset.

16:48.838 --> 16:52.296
Go to the aquarium, marvel at that...
albino alligator.

16:52.380 --> 16:54.421
- It's all good!
- Mm-hmm.

16:54.505 --> 16:55.838
I'm gonna go do inventory.

17:24.171 --> 17:25.921
Oh, God.

17:26.005 --> 17:29.088
I'm sorry.
I'm just, um, getting the oyster sauce.

17:30.255 --> 17:32.380
Okay. Um...

17:33.755 --> 17:35.880
Never give anybody your heart, Enrique.

17:38.755 --> 17:39.630
Thank you, Chef.

18:07.046 --> 18:07.880

18:08.213 --> 18:09.963
- Veronica!
- Yes.

18:10.046 --> 18:11.630
- You're back in San Francisco?
- Hi.

18:11.838 --> 18:13.713
My God! How long's it been?

18:13.796 --> 18:16.880
Oh, gosh. I don't think I've seen you
since high school graduation.

18:17.338 --> 18:18.796
Veronica?

18:19.171 --> 18:20.171
Marcus!

18:20.255 --> 18:21.588
Hey!

18:21.671 --> 18:24.255
Oh, my goodness! Hi!

18:24.338 --> 18:25.463
- All right.
- Hi, hi, hi!

18:25.546 --> 18:27.838
I'll bring the rest. Be right back.

18:28.005 --> 18:29.671
- Wow, look at you!
- Yeah.

18:29.755 --> 18:30.713
It's so good to see you.

18:30.796 --> 18:33.546
- You, too.
- So you lost all your piercings, huh?

18:33.630 --> 18:35.171
Oh no, not all of 'em.

18:40.046 --> 18:43.713
Uh, well,
uh, thank you for hiring us for this job

18:43.796 --> 18:45.463
and, uh,
congrats on the house and the baby.

18:45.546 --> 18:47.505
- Oh, thanks. It's not my house, though.
- Hey, V!

18:47.588 --> 18:49.005
The bathroom counter is too high.

18:49.088 --> 18:50.463
I'm gonna need a stool to--

18:56.005 --> 18:59.046
Uh, hey, what's up?

18:59.213 --> 19:01.005
Wow. Look who's here? It's...

19:01.505 --> 19:03.213
Look who's here, this-- This is...

19:03.296 --> 19:05.338
And who's in the house. It's you!

19:05.421 --> 19:06.546
This is amazing.

19:06.796 --> 19:10.088
- Hi, Marcus.
- Hi! Yeah, hi, Sasha.

19:10.171 --> 19:13.005
Hi. Hello. Hi. What's up?

19:14.046 --> 19:15.505
Long time.

19:15.880 --> 19:19.171
Yes. Yes.
Very long time, uh, very much so indeed.

19:19.255 --> 19:24.296
Uh... But, you know, time passes,
and now it's like current, modern...

19:24.838 --> 19:27.796
It's like we're here, and this is great.
It's...

19:28.796 --> 19:29.796
So I...

19:30.046 --> 19:32.046
I guess you're the air conditioning guy?

19:32.380 --> 19:34.755
Oh? Oh, this?
No, no, I just like the ease of a onesie.

19:34.838 --> 19:36.171
Oh, okay.

19:36.380 --> 19:38.630
You're back in town?
I thought you moved to LA.

19:38.713 --> 19:40.338
Uh, I-- I did. Um...

19:40.421 --> 19:43.338
I'm just renting this house.
I'm here for two months.

19:43.588 --> 19:45.130
We're opening a restaurant.

19:45.296 --> 19:47.546
If you're renting,
then why are you installing AC--

19:47.630 --> 19:50.046
No way! Sasha Tran!

19:50.130 --> 19:52.505
Mr. Kim! Oh, my God.

19:52.588 --> 19:54.630
Oh!

19:54.713 --> 19:55.713
Look at you!

19:55.796 --> 19:58.546
You have not changed one bit.
How do you not age?

19:58.963 --> 20:00.463
I wash my face with shampoo.

20:02.421 --> 20:05.630
I can't believe I'm seeing you.
We thought you'd never come back.

20:05.713 --> 20:07.630
- You're like our own Asian Oprah.
- Oh!

20:07.713 --> 20:09.421
How much money do you have now?

20:10.963 --> 20:11.838
He's serious.

20:12.463 --> 20:15.380
- Oh...
- Oh! I just read you're getting married

20:15.838 --> 20:18.296
to that guy, your manager. Seems great!

20:18.380 --> 20:20.796
Older than I thought, but...

20:21.171 --> 20:22.005
good.

20:22.338 --> 20:25.296
- How old is he?
- He's a very young 50.

20:25.380 --> 20:27.171
Uh, he does a lot of Capoeira.

20:27.505 --> 20:31.463
He, uh, shops at, uh, um... Under Armour.

20:32.088 --> 20:33.588
And, uh, he has...

20:33.921 --> 20:36.171
uh, 57,000 followers on Instagram.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.838
Okay. Well, me and Marcus,

20:39.921 --> 20:42.505
we're gonna get you all set up.
Don't worry. Oh!

20:42.880 --> 20:44.546
Invest your money in lettuce.

20:44.838 --> 20:46.463
Kale can't hold on forever.

20:48.921 --> 20:49.880
Hmm.

20:50.213 --> 20:52.630
Dude, you so did that on purpose.

20:52.713 --> 20:54.505
I thought
it was just gonna be Mr. Kim.

20:54.588 --> 20:57.046
I had no idea
Marcus was gonna be working with him.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.921
The company
is literally called "Harry and Son."

21:00.338 --> 21:02.588
Yeah, "sun," like in the sky.

21:03.046 --> 21:04.505
- It's what I thought.
- Whatever.

21:04.588 --> 21:05.713
Your plan didn't work.

21:05.796 --> 21:08.171
Well, I thought
this was your six-month Bachelorette.

21:08.255 --> 21:09.421
Yeah, with strangers.

21:09.796 --> 21:12.088
I'm not trying to Bachelorette
with Marcus Kim.

21:12.171 --> 21:13.630
There's way too much history there.

21:13.838 --> 21:17.171
- Plus, he's so not my type anymore.
- Oh, you mean because he's not an asshole?

21:17.255 --> 21:20.171
Oh, he's an asshole.
He's just a stealth asshole.

21:20.505 --> 21:23.171
Like those good-looking guys,
those white dudes with a beard

21:23.255 --> 21:25.213
that come up to you on the street,
all good-looking,

21:25.296 --> 21:27.005
ask you how you're doing,

21:27.130 --> 21:29.505
and then you realize
they're carrying a clipboard,

21:29.588 --> 21:33.546
asking to donate money
for some endangered flora and fauna.

21:33.921 --> 21:37.255
- Misleading you.
- All right, I'll take that as a maybe.

21:37.463 --> 21:40.088
Look, I gotta go.
Denise wants to talk nursery motif.

21:40.171 --> 21:42.713
And for some reason,
she's so anti-penguin.

21:42.921 --> 21:45.088
I mean, this one has a hat on it.

21:45.338 --> 21:47.546
It's so cute.
I didn't know penguins get cold.

21:47.630 --> 21:49.713
I think it's fiction when they wear hats.

21:49.796 --> 21:52.755
I always forget whether fiction's
the real one or the fake one.

21:53.921 --> 21:55.963
- Love you!
- I love you, too. Good night.

22:00.796 --> 22:01.921
Look at my pool.

22:02.921 --> 22:05.546
You know who doesn't have a pool? Marcus.

22:12.046 --> 22:14.546
No,
the LA restaurant is non-denominational,

22:14.630 --> 22:15.755
modern Vietnamese fusion.

22:16.130 --> 22:19.046
The San Francisco one
is gonna be a step up from that.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.713
It's trans-denominational.

22:22.588 --> 22:25.088
Yes! Yes!

22:25.338 --> 22:29.171
Transgressive, transforming, transcendent.
Ah! Brilliant!

22:29.255 --> 22:31.755
Excellent thoughts, as always.
Thank you, Julian.

22:34.130 --> 22:35.505
Mm.

22:39.213 --> 22:41.005
Does it get tiring doing that?

22:41.213 --> 22:43.005
My work? No. I love it.

22:43.213 --> 22:44.838
No, your phone voice.

22:44.921 --> 22:45.796
My what?

22:46.671 --> 22:48.796
You know, that voice you use on the phone.

22:49.130 --> 22:52.296
"Brilliant!
Excellent, as always. Ta-ta, Julian!"

22:52.421 --> 22:53.505
Okay, first of all,

22:53.588 --> 22:54.880
you sound like Count Chocula.

22:55.088 --> 22:56.963
And that's very rude, Marcus.

22:57.255 --> 22:59.921
Especially considering
I'm the customer paying you money.

23:00.213 --> 23:03.130
It's just funny
because I know it's not you, that voice.

23:03.380 --> 23:05.463
Well, you haven't known me
for a very long time.

23:05.546 --> 23:08.046
And PS, have you seen yourself
in those coveralls?

23:08.130 --> 23:09.421
You look like a homeless astronaut.

23:10.421 --> 23:12.546
Hey, guys, I'm off to the restaurant,

23:12.630 --> 23:15.088
but I picked you up
some breakfast burritos.

23:15.171 --> 23:18.296
- Mm!
- I've already had one. Well, two.

23:18.588 --> 23:21.005
- Who's counting?
- Excellent.

23:21.838 --> 23:23.213
Ta-ta, Veronica!

23:23.296 --> 23:24.630
Oh, don't use your phone voice
on me, bitch.

23:29.255 --> 23:31.463
So, you just set it...

23:32.171 --> 23:34.713
...and forget it.
Like that commercial for that thing.

23:35.005 --> 23:36.713
- What thing?
- I can't remember.

23:36.796 --> 23:39.838
But if you have any problems,
like I said, call us.

23:40.380 --> 23:41.963
Thanks, Mr. Kim.

23:44.588 --> 23:45.546
Uh...

23:45.921 --> 23:48.213
- Thank you, Marcus.
- You're welcome, Sasha.

23:50.088 --> 23:51.796
Um...

23:52.880 --> 23:55.338
Oh, wait! Did you invite Sasha
to your gig tomorrow?

23:55.421 --> 23:56.296
- She'd love it.
- No.

23:56.380 --> 23:58.588
- Gig?
- Hello Peril. His band.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.796
- You ought to go. They're so good!
- Let's not do this, Dad.

24:00.880 --> 24:02.546
Hello Peril's still together?

24:02.630 --> 24:04.755
- Sixteen years strong.
- Wow.

24:04.838 --> 24:06.588
- I'll get you a flyer for the show.
- No, do not get a--

24:06.671 --> 24:08.630
- They're in the van.
- Why are you getting--

24:09.796 --> 24:13.380
- The whole original band's still together?
- No, it's just me and Quasar.

24:13.463 --> 24:15.046
Um, but remember Tony Gill?

24:15.130 --> 24:16.630
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. He joined.

24:16.713 --> 24:18.838
The only one you don't know
is our drummer, Ginger.

24:18.921 --> 24:19.755
She's awesome.

24:19.838 --> 24:21.921
She grew up in the Bay Area.
She had three moms.

24:22.338 --> 24:25.255
Oh! Their tampon budget must have been
through the roof.

24:25.338 --> 24:27.630
Hey, look at that.

24:27.838 --> 24:30.463
Um... My-- My schedule tomorrow's
a little tight, so...

24:30.546 --> 24:32.213
- Yeah.
- Well, if it changes.

24:34.380 --> 24:35.546
I have to say, uh...

24:35.963 --> 24:39.171
I'm surprised you two lost touch.
You used to be so close.

24:40.130 --> 24:41.130
I always thought...

24:41.713 --> 24:43.796
maybe you'd end up together.

24:44.921 --> 24:46.338
Dad! Jesus!

24:48.588 --> 24:50.505
Okay... Um...

24:51.005 --> 24:51.838
Yeah.

25:49.005 --> 25:52.088
So design-wise,
we're very much embracing your philosophy

25:52.171 --> 25:54.963
of highlighting the original architecture
of the space.

25:55.046 --> 25:59.421
Okay. So, right here, I'm thinking
big communal table with Gubi chairs.

25:59.505 --> 26:02.005
Over here, two-tops with Gubi chairs.

26:02.088 --> 26:04.713
Right over here, I'm thinking four-tops
with Gubi chairs,

26:04.796 --> 26:07.880
and in this little nook right here,
I'm thinking a six-top round with--

26:07.963 --> 26:09.796
Let me guess: Gubi chairs!

26:10.338 --> 26:11.796
I was thinking high-back...

26:12.255 --> 26:14.046
but, you know what?
You're the boss,

26:14.130 --> 26:16.380
so we can absolutely switch them
to Gubis.

26:16.463 --> 26:18.880
I don't even really know
what Gubi chairs look like.

26:19.213 --> 26:21.213
You know, they look a bit like chairs.

26:22.005 --> 26:24.296
Um... Meaning that they've got--

26:24.463 --> 26:27.921
They've got these, like... uh,
four kind of like...

26:28.796 --> 26:30.338
legs.
I don't know why I'm doing that gesture,

26:30.421 --> 26:31.505
and that's inappropriate.

26:31.588 --> 26:32.588
- I'm so sorry.
- Hello?

26:32.671 --> 26:33.796
- Um...
- Sasha!

26:33.880 --> 26:34.713
Hello?

26:34.796 --> 26:36.588
Sasha!

26:37.213 --> 26:38.588
- Sasha!
- Sasha? Are you in there?

26:38.880 --> 26:41.171
- Why are my parents here?
- Ooh, I don't know.

26:41.255 --> 26:44.005
- Parking meter is expired!
- I kept saying "Gubi."

26:44.088 --> 26:44.963
Yeah, you did.

26:45.088 --> 26:47.755
- I was spiraling.
- You got a little sweat on your top lip.

26:47.838 --> 26:51.213
- She's gonna fire me, isn't she?
- No. She'd make me do it.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.380
Oh! Hey!

26:55.838 --> 26:58.296
Hi.

26:58.755 --> 27:01.421
Hi! How are you?

27:01.963 --> 27:05.713
- Wow, this is so crazy you guys are here.
- Who picked you up from the airport?

27:05.796 --> 27:06.880
I got car service.

27:07.046 --> 27:08.130
Oh, no.

27:08.463 --> 27:09.671
Did you have to pay tip?

27:09.755 --> 27:12.671
No, Dad. I jumped out
when he slowed down at a stop sign.

27:12.838 --> 27:15.171
So, what are you guys doing here?

27:15.255 --> 27:18.130
Veronica posted on Facebook
that you would be here.

27:18.463 --> 27:20.213
Oh!

27:20.921 --> 27:23.671
Is someone-- I think someone's calling me
about Gubi chairs.

27:23.838 --> 27:25.338
We're just happy you're home.

27:25.421 --> 27:27.630
Now that we have sold
the store, we have so much free time.

27:27.921 --> 27:30.755
We are throwing
your cousin Barry's son, Liam,

27:30.838 --> 27:32.130
a birthday party next week.

27:32.713 --> 27:34.671
So, you get to see the new house.

27:34.755 --> 27:37.463
I didn't think I would like retirement,
but it's good.

27:37.546 --> 27:39.713
Yesterday, I hung a bird feeder in a tree.

27:39.796 --> 27:42.255
That's great, Dad, but you know,
guys, um...

27:42.338 --> 27:44.338
I'm gonna be really busy
opening the restaurant.

27:44.713 --> 27:48.880
I have two months to finalize the layout,
design the menu, choose the suppliers.

27:49.171 --> 27:51.505
Then I fly to New York
and have to do it all over again.

27:51.588 --> 27:52.755
What day?

27:52.838 --> 27:54.713
I know someone in New York
who can pick you up.

27:54.796 --> 27:55.963

Our T-shirt table sales have been fire.

28:59.296 --> 29:00.338
Stop.

29:00.796 --> 29:02.130
So, how many have we sold?

29:02.463 --> 29:03.463
Nine.

29:03.921 --> 29:05.880
Well, two got sent back, so...

29:06.380 --> 29:07.505
seven.

29:07.755 --> 29:11.630
- Seven?
- And I also got these.

29:15.046 --> 29:17.671
Hello Peril. Boop.

29:18.630 --> 29:21.088
But tennis balls have nothing
to do with our band.

29:21.171 --> 29:22.046
Uh, counterpoint:

29:22.130 --> 29:24.588
since when has our band made any sense?

29:25.171 --> 29:26.005
Okay.

29:26.380 --> 29:28.880
Well,
maybe we'll have a better chance of...

29:29.505 --> 29:31.796
selling these if we start playing...

29:32.255 --> 29:33.338
bigger venues.

29:33.421 --> 29:35.130
When are we gonna talk about tensions
in the band,

29:35.213 --> 29:37.213
'cause I'm mad at two of you right now.

29:38.130 --> 29:39.380
Marcus, did you have a chance
to call Southie's

29:39.463 --> 29:41.171
and ask about us playing Thursday nights?

29:41.255 --> 29:42.963
Oh, yeah... um, no.

29:43.130 --> 29:44.380
I don't like Southie's.

29:44.463 --> 29:46.088
Okay, okay, fair,

29:46.171 --> 29:48.838
except they're, like, three times
the size of this place.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.463
Yeah,
but they're on the other side of town.

29:50.546 --> 29:53.463
- People don't know us over there.
- Yeah, because we've never been there!

29:53.796 --> 29:56.338
Marcus, this is just like
when you refused to try cold brew

29:56.421 --> 29:57.713
because you'd never heard of it.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.588
And then it took a year
of me convincing you to try it,

30:00.671 --> 30:02.380
and then what happened? Huh?

30:02.755 --> 30:05.213
- What do you love now?
- Cold brew.

30:05.296 --> 30:06.713
Cold brew.

30:07.463 --> 30:09.296
I'm mad at Tony and myself.

30:10.046 --> 30:12.963
Tony annoys me,
and I'm mad at myself for that.

30:19.296 --> 30:20.338
Thank you so much!

30:20.421 --> 30:23.380
The next band is Hello Peril.
You don't wanna miss out.

30:25.671 --> 30:28.338
What's up, everybody?

30:28.421 --> 30:30.921
Hey, what's up, Bay Area?

30:31.005 --> 30:33.755
Yeah!

30:33.838 --> 30:36.046
All right, we are Hello Peril,

Hey, speaking of serving...

30:41.171 --> 30:42.380
who here likes tennis?

30:44.880 --> 30:48.421
All right.
Um, well-- Well, it's a great sport.

30:48.796 --> 30:51.671
- And we've got Hello Peril tennis balls...
- Yeah.

30:51.755 --> 30:53.838
I think they filmed some
of Boys Don't Cry here.

30:53.921 --> 30:55.421
Oh, which part?

30:56.213 --> 30:57.213
Not a good part.

30:57.338 --> 31:00.505
There you go. Yeah.
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

31:01.130 --> 31:02.546
All right, who's ready

So for your baby shower,

32:15.755 --> 32:17.880
I think I'm just gonna do,
like, a zoo theme.

32:18.130 --> 32:19.546
- Zoo?
- Yeah, zoo.

32:19.630 --> 32:21.046
- That's very safe. There's monkeys--
- No.

32:21.130 --> 32:23.338
Look, I'm gonna be changing diapers
for a very long time.

32:23.421 --> 32:25.630
I don't wanna smell shit
at my baby shower.

32:25.713 --> 32:27.588
- No, I'm not gonna have a zoo--
- I want--

32:27.671 --> 32:29.671
No way! Sasha and Veronica?

32:29.755 --> 32:30.713
- What's up?
- Hey.

32:30.796 --> 32:32.088
Hey, Tony, looking good.

32:32.171 --> 32:33.796
Thanks, girl. Feeling good.

32:35.046 --> 32:36.921
Oh shit, that's not mine, is it?

32:37.005 --> 32:40.630
- No, honey. It's my fiancée's. Denise.
- Cool!

32:40.713 --> 32:44.963
Um, actually, I'm a-- an LGBTQIA ally.

32:45.755 --> 32:48.296
So, thank you, uh, for your service.

32:50.046 --> 32:52.755
Uh, so anyway,
I-- I thought you couldn't make it.

32:52.838 --> 32:56.338
Oh, well, my schedule cleared up
last minute, so I thought I'd stop by.

32:56.546 --> 32:57.380
Sure, of course.

32:57.546 --> 33:00.546
- Yeah, it was fun.
- You guys are so good.

33:00.630 --> 33:03.213
- You're just blowing up, too.
- Oh, yes we are.

33:03.338 --> 33:04.921
Um, I don't know if you heard,

33:05.005 --> 33:07.255
- but we sold seven T-shirts.
- Oh!

33:07.338 --> 33:09.380
- What are you, like Old Navy?
- Yes, yes.

33:10.630 --> 33:13.296
I could listen to this story all night,
but I can't.

33:13.380 --> 33:15.296
I'm gonna go check to make sure

33:15.380 --> 33:17.171
- I haven't dropped my placenta.
- Oh.

33:17.255 --> 33:19.630
- Bye! Thank you for coming.
- [Okay. So much fun.

33:19.713 --> 33:22.171
- Bye, V!
- Love is love is... love.

33:22.338 --> 33:23.171
Gosh, Tony.

33:24.046 --> 33:26.130
So, uh, what are you guys up to?
You hungry?

33:26.213 --> 33:27.588
Oh, yeah. I'm down for some food.

33:27.671 --> 33:30.921
I actually have to get up early tomorrow,
but thank you for inviting me, Marcus.

33:32.588 --> 33:35.880
You killed it, babe!

33:36.171 --> 33:38.421
That was your best set yet, babe!

33:42.338 --> 33:48.213
Oh, my gosh, you guys. I forgot.
I, um... have to, uh... uh, vote.

33:49.046 --> 33:51.963
- Babe, that was so hot!
- Jenny! Jenny! Jenny.

33:52.421 --> 33:54.921
Jenny, this is Sasha. Sasha, Jenny.

33:55.921 --> 33:56.963
Oh, my God.

33:57.755 --> 33:58.755
Sasha Tran?

34:00.963 --> 34:03.630
Oh... Oh, hey.

34:04.046 --> 34:06.505
It's a lot of-- Lot of hair...

34:06.588 --> 34:08.295
...in my mouth, a little bit.

34:10.088 --> 34:12.670
It is so nice to finally meet you.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.963
It's nice to meet you, too.

34:15.045 --> 34:19.088
Marcus told me you guys are old friends,
but I kind of didn't believe him.

34:20.505 --> 34:21.838
I am a huge fan.

34:22.088 --> 34:24.920
You have to let me cook
for you tonight.

34:25.295 --> 34:27.380
- Oh, uh, Sasha has to get up early.
- Well...

34:28.005 --> 34:29.130
not that early.

34:30.130 --> 34:31.170
Really?

34:46.045 --> 34:47.920
Wow, Jenny.

34:48.838 --> 34:50.880
This looks... amazing.

34:51.130 --> 34:52.005
Thank you.

34:57.045 --> 34:58.546
Is that Vienna sausage?

34:58.630 --> 35:00.296
Yeah.

35:04.671 --> 35:07.213
Mm! So good!

35:07.296 --> 35:09.796
- Hey!
- She likes it.

35:10.005 --> 35:13.463
Sasha Tran likes my cooking!

35:14.421 --> 35:16.338
How did you and Marcus meet?

35:16.963 --> 35:18.380
Oh, um...

35:20.421 --> 35:22.838
The community youth group
that I work with...

35:23.005 --> 35:25.338
um, was performing performance art

35:25.421 --> 35:30.088
about the illegal trafficking
of tropical birds, and...

35:30.755 --> 35:34.421
Hello Peril was on the same bill,
and I saw him perform,

35:34.505 --> 35:35.963
and I just fell in love.

35:36.921 --> 35:40.005
Wow, babe,
that was almost five months ago.

35:40.088 --> 35:42.421
- Can you believe it?
- Five months? Wow. Yeah.

35:42.505 --> 35:44.963
I was a polyam
before Marcus and I got married.

35:45.296 --> 35:47.880
Wait... you two are married?

35:48.171 --> 35:49.588
No, no, no. No, we're not.

35:49.671 --> 35:53.796
Not in your traditional,
heteronormative sense.

35:54.005 --> 35:55.380
We're married spiritually

35:55.671 --> 35:56.796
and sexually.

35:56.921 --> 35:58.588
Yeah, but not literally.

35:59.588 --> 36:01.963
Uh, anyway, Jenny is, um, amazing.

36:02.130 --> 36:04.880
She, uh, works with underserved kids
in the community,

36:04.963 --> 36:08.421
teaching them drama and music,
and, uh, she's taught me a lot

36:08.505 --> 36:11.171
about being more conscious
of the world around me, you know.

36:11.505 --> 36:13.338
That's great.

36:13.421 --> 36:16.630
FYI. These are, uh, Paula Deen plates,
you know, the...

36:17.296 --> 36:18.255
racist butter lady.

36:18.921 --> 36:21.046
Oh, I know. That's why I stole them.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.880
Oh! Uh...

36:29.255 --> 36:31.005
- Oh, another one.
- Another one!

36:31.088 --> 36:33.463
Oh!

36:38.046 --> 36:39.421
You don't have to give me a ride home.

36:39.505 --> 36:40.713
I can call an Uber.

36:41.005 --> 36:43.671
I'd be happy to charge you for the ride
if it makes you feel better.

36:43.755 --> 36:46.338
Uh, you know it wouldn't.

36:49.546 --> 36:51.713
So, uh... Jenny's...

36:52.338 --> 36:53.421
quite the character.

36:53.713 --> 36:57.088
Yeah, she's, um... very free, you know?

36:57.171 --> 37:00.296
How does an Asian person
even cultivate dreadlocks on their head?

37:00.380 --> 37:02.421
I don't know,
but a crocheting tool is involved.

37:02.505 --> 37:04.796
Oh. Does the carpet match the drapes?

37:04.880 --> 37:07.171
No, it's just a huge bush.

37:07.255 --> 37:09.380
I kind of love it, though, you know?

37:09.463 --> 37:12.338
She sleeps bottomless
like a sexy Asian Winnie the Pooh.

37:17.421 --> 37:18.380
No way.

37:19.713 --> 37:22.713
- You still have the Corolla?
- In the same condition, too.

37:24.505 --> 37:25.755
Oh!

37:26.213 --> 37:28.338
Oh, locks stopped working in 2007.

37:28.671 --> 37:29.588
Oh...

37:31.880 --> 37:33.921
Yeah.

37:47.963 --> 37:49.088
What are you looking at?

37:49.171 --> 37:51.255
- Nothing.
- Why were you looking in my back seat?

37:51.338 --> 37:55.671
I wasn't. I was just, uh...
My chiropractor says I gotta, you know...

37:56.005 --> 37:57.338
- turn, rotate my--
- Look at the back seat?

37:57.421 --> 37:59.255
- Yeah.
- Because we had sex back there?

37:59.338 --> 38:01.463
- Oh, my God!
- That's why you're looking back there.

38:01.546 --> 38:02.463
Just calling you out on it.

38:03.838 --> 38:06.296
So what do you think?
Seeing it after all these years?

38:06.380 --> 38:08.921
That it might be even smaller
and grosser than I remember.

38:09.005 --> 38:11.046
You better still be talking
about my back seat.

38:12.546 --> 38:15.005
Hey, uh, by the way,
it would have been nice, you know,

38:15.088 --> 38:18.588
would have been cool to lose my virginity
someplace classy like, uh...

38:18.921 --> 38:20.421
on a blanket in a gazebo.

38:20.505 --> 38:21.713
Little hotel by the Bay.

38:22.005 --> 38:24.130
- A hotel by the Bay?
- A hotel by the Bay.

38:24.421 --> 38:27.171
Who was I? A lawyer having an affair
with a coworker?

38:27.713 --> 38:30.838
- I was 18. I had no money.
- Well, you could have saved it.

38:30.921 --> 38:31.796
You could have stolen it.

38:31.880 --> 38:34.296
You stole nuts out of the nut bins
every day at Rainbow Grocery.

38:34.380 --> 38:36.380
Okay, that's not stealing.
That's called "tasting."

38:36.463 --> 38:38.671
That's why they got those flaps,
so you could try shit.

38:38.755 --> 38:41.546
Whatever. The past is the past, right?

38:42.421 --> 38:44.588
Please tell Jenny
I enjoyed her enthusiasm.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.588
Not the sausage, not the...

38:46.963 --> 38:49.421
maca powder mixed with the ketchup,
but, uh...

38:49.505 --> 38:51.463
...her energy, her chi,

38:51.963 --> 38:53.630
her yin, her yang, all of it.

38:53.713 --> 38:54.963
I will.

38:59.796 --> 39:01.713
Well... uh, okay. Uh, bye.

39:01.796 --> 39:03.130
Bye.

39:04.296 --> 39:06.255
Oh, uh...

39:06.338 --> 39:08.088
Yeah, I-- I have to do that
from the outside.

39:08.171 --> 39:09.338
Oh! That weapon again. Hm.

39:12.671 --> 39:14.130
This window thing came off in my hand.

39:18.130 --> 39:19.046
What'd you say?

39:19.130 --> 39:21.046
I said, "This window thing came off
in my hand."

39:21.130 --> 39:22.421
Oh, right. Okay.

39:22.505 --> 39:23.838
- Thanks.
- All right, bye.

39:23.921 --> 39:25.213
Bye.

39:36.921 --> 39:39.755
And we could make the print look
like handwritten calligraphy.

39:39.838 --> 39:41.880
Oh, good. And print it on rice paper.

39:41.963 --> 39:44.088
- White people eat that shit up.
- Guilty.

39:46.338 --> 39:48.796
Hey, the flatware rep is here.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.505
I know, it's a lot.

39:51.005 --> 39:52.171
And Netflix just called.

39:52.255 --> 39:54.505
They wanna know if you can cater
a wrap party this Sunday at the Fairmont.

39:55.505 --> 39:57.505
- Is it for The Crown?
- No.

39:57.588 --> 40:00.921
It's for that new Kevin James show
where he plays a young Benjamin Franklin.

40:02.421 --> 40:05.796
Um... Okay, screw it. Yeah, sure.

40:05.880 --> 40:08.713
- Why not?
- All right!

40:22.755 --> 40:24.380
Is that Padma Lakshmi?

40:25.671 --> 40:28.380
He's Bacheloretting with Padma?

40:28.630 --> 40:32.005
Stupid, beautiful, talented Padma Lakshmi.

40:46.588 --> 40:49.046
I mean, what did we do
before the Internet?

40:49.130 --> 40:52.130
Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and fill out
the application for the audition...

40:57.046 --> 40:59.130
They wanna know
if any of us have been married

40:59.213 --> 41:00.880
for the application for the auditions.

41:00.963 --> 41:03.338
That's so weird-- Hello, Marcus?

41:03.421 --> 41:05.505
Are you listening to me
or are you messaging someone?

41:06.130 --> 41:09.171
- Oh, um... No, I'm listening. What's up?
- I called Southie's.

41:09.255 --> 41:11.796
They said Thursdays are open,
but we've gotta audition.

41:11.880 --> 41:13.588
Against 100 other bands.

41:13.671 --> 41:15.338
I mean, yeah, at least. It's Southie's.

41:15.421 --> 41:18.046
- Isn't that great?
- I have a question for you.

41:18.421 --> 41:19.255
Shoot.

41:19.338 --> 41:21.171
Why did you bail on dinner
the other night?

41:21.671 --> 41:22.546
What dinner?

41:22.630 --> 41:23.671
After the show.

41:23.755 --> 41:26.130
Remember? We were all gonna go to dinner,
and then...

41:26.213 --> 41:28.255
Jenny showed up, and then you bailed.

41:28.630 --> 41:31.838
Oh... Yeah, that's... Uh...

41:32.171 --> 41:34.505
- You-- You know, uh, I had...
- Uh...

41:34.588 --> 41:36.005
- What?
- I know what?

41:36.088 --> 41:37.546
- You were gonna say something?
- You--

41:37.630 --> 41:40.463
- I'm asking you, why did you bail?
- Right, and then you said something after.

41:40.546 --> 41:42.046
- I didn't.
- You were gonna tell me why I bailed.

41:42.130 --> 41:44.963
- No. No, I'm asking you why.
- Right. Um...

41:45.338 --> 41:46.588
You forgot what your lie was, didn't you?

41:47.130 --> 41:48.255
- I did.
- Yeah.

41:48.338 --> 41:50.296
Whatever. Um...

41:50.421 --> 41:52.921
Are we done with this meeting?
Because I wanna smoke weed now,

41:53.005 --> 41:54.713
but I don't wanna disrespect the process.

41:55.088 --> 41:56.463
Whoa! Me, too. Light her up.

41:59.588 --> 42:01.296
- Suppress the darkness.
- Yep.

42:16.630 --> 42:19.046
♪ Believe in the magic ♪

42:19.130 --> 42:21.796
♪ Magic, magic, believe in the magic ♪

42:21.880 --> 42:23.421
♪ Magic, magic ♪

42:27.213 --> 42:28.130
Barry.

42:28.296 --> 42:29.838
Hey! So glad you came.

42:29.921 --> 42:31.755
- Oh.
- Always fun seeing my famous cousin.

42:31.838 --> 42:34.546
No! Thanks for inviting me.

42:35.838 --> 42:37.505
Can you believe all this?

42:37.588 --> 42:40.046
You know what my parents gave me
for my eighth birthday?

42:40.130 --> 42:40.963
Flip-flops.

42:41.046 --> 42:44.213
Well, they've been
amazing godparents to Liam.

42:44.630 --> 42:45.921
They're really close.

42:46.630 --> 42:47.671
Nice for Liam.

42:47.755 --> 42:49.421
But sometimes they do go
a little overboard.

42:49.505 --> 42:51.588
Like getting a Diana Ross impersonator.

42:55.130 --> 42:58.421
What's a Diana Ross impersonator doing
at an eight-year-old's birthday party?

42:58.838 --> 43:01.213
Your dad said she was much cheaper
than Beyoncé.

43:05.880 --> 43:07.546
So, when are you gonna find out
the gender?

43:07.630 --> 43:13.088
I'm doing a non-gender-binary situation,
so just give me gray baby clothes.

43:13.255 --> 43:14.713
- Hey.
- Hey!

43:14.796 --> 43:16.046
- Yeah.
- You made it.

43:16.130 --> 43:17.505
- Thanks for the invite.
- Yeah.

43:17.588 --> 43:18.463
Yeah.

43:21.505 --> 43:22.921
- What's up, V?
- You know.

43:23.005 --> 43:25.838
- I do.
- Yeah.

43:27.171 --> 43:28.921
I think your dad's already here.

43:31.088 --> 43:33.338
- Lemonade?
- Oh... thanks.

43:33.546 --> 43:35.796
I'm Harry. Uh, huge Diana Ross fan.

43:36.546 --> 43:38.380
Kathy. Huge lemonade fan.

43:40.046 --> 43:43.380
I, uh... didn't know what to get him,
so I just went with Legos.

43:43.463 --> 43:45.630
Oh, what did you bring, Sasha?

43:45.921 --> 43:47.380
Kids love chocolate, all right?

43:47.463 --> 43:50.088
Matcha green tea dark chocolate
with French gray sea salt?

43:50.171 --> 43:52.255
Yes. Kids know that shit is delicious.

43:58.005 --> 43:59.338
Sorry, I'll be right back.

43:59.588 --> 44:00.630
That's cool.

44:01.505 --> 44:02.588
What kind of Legos?

44:03.171 --> 44:04.046
Red.

44:07.171 --> 44:08.088
- Hey!
- Hey.

44:08.338 --> 44:09.880
I know we said we wouldn't talk.

44:09.963 --> 44:11.796
No, it's okay.

44:12.380 --> 44:15.005
It's just that yesterday...
something hit me.

44:16.046 --> 44:18.171
I finally realized...

44:19.046 --> 44:22.796
that we need to think bigger
in terms of your global branding.

44:22.880 --> 44:25.671
Padma was making me breakfast
this morning, and she agrees.

44:25.755 --> 44:28.755
- Mm-hmm.
- Your food can be transcontinental--

44:28.838 --> 44:31.088
- Brandon!
- Trans-denominational...

44:31.255 --> 44:32.130
- Trans--
- Brandon!

44:32.213 --> 44:34.671
- What?
- I don't give a shit, okay?

44:34.755 --> 44:36.921
I don't give a shit
about your branding thoughts.

44:37.463 --> 44:39.671
You never loved me.
This was just about business.

44:39.755 --> 44:42.546
I cannot believe I wasted
my prime reproductive years on you.

44:43.255 --> 44:44.880
I hope you have terrible karma

44:44.963 --> 44:48.005
and come back in the next life
as a nasty little lizard

44:48.088 --> 44:50.671
and get stepped on by someone on a hike!

44:51.546 --> 44:54.005
You are getting the finger
so hard right now.

44:54.296 --> 44:55.671
I hope you get malaria

44:55.921 --> 44:59.088
and shit yourself to death,
you shitty piece of shit!

45:05.130 --> 45:06.713
A little softer, please.

45:07.338 --> 45:08.963
You are scaring the goats.

45:09.755 --> 45:10.713
Oh...

45:11.630 --> 45:13.088
We are so done.

45:13.921 --> 45:17.130
It was like being in love with a statue.
A sexy, handsome, chiseled statue

45:17.213 --> 45:19.088
of a Korean Eric from The Little Mermaid.

45:19.171 --> 45:20.588
He was just too perfect, you know?

45:20.671 --> 45:23.005
Like, I never felt
like I could be myself around him.

45:23.088 --> 45:24.671
Like, if I had to fart, I'd have to go

45:24.755 --> 45:26.671
to a completely different room
of the house.

45:26.755 --> 45:28.380
And he was so self-centered.

45:28.463 --> 45:31.171
He kept on saying how much he loved
and supported my career,

45:31.255 --> 45:33.880
when really it was just all
about how it made him look.

45:34.213 --> 45:37.046
All these men keep saying how much
they want a strong woman.

45:37.130 --> 45:39.088
What they really want is a cheerleader.

45:39.588 --> 45:42.713
So, yeah. I'm gonna die all alone
in a big house all by myself

45:42.796 --> 45:46.296
in complete, utter, and deafening silence.
I can feel it, Marcus.

45:48.213 --> 45:49.046
There, there.

45:51.838 --> 45:53.796
"There, there?" That-- That's all you got?

45:53.880 --> 45:55.755
Well, I had more
at the beginning of your speech,

45:55.838 --> 45:57.213
and then I forgot it by the end.

45:57.296 --> 45:59.338
Sorry. It was just so long.

46:00.171 --> 46:01.921
Oh, hey. Thank you.

46:05.255 --> 46:06.838
I can't believe this place
is still in business.

46:07.213 --> 46:09.463
What are we even doing here?
The food was always so terrible.

46:10.546 --> 46:12.505
- Are you insane?
- No.

46:12.588 --> 46:15.630
I eat here twice a week.
Here. Just try this, okay?

46:24.255 --> 46:26.421
- Hmm?
- Oh.

46:26.671 --> 46:29.671
- Yeah?
- Why do I remember this place as so bad?

46:29.755 --> 46:31.796
Because that's how you remember
your entire childhood.

46:31.880 --> 46:34.380
You painted the whole thing
with a shit brush, but it's not true.

46:35.713 --> 46:36.588
You're right.

46:37.380 --> 46:38.546
This is good.

46:40.130 --> 46:42.546
This place hasn't changed one bit, either.

46:43.005 --> 46:44.130
Those women are still so rude

46:44.213 --> 46:46.338
and disappointed
that neither of us speak Cantonese.

46:46.838 --> 46:50.130
Hmm. Hello!

46:50.213 --> 46:52.088
Hi, Marcus!

46:52.171 --> 46:54.171
- Hello!
- Marcus!

46:55.046 --> 46:56.380
I learned. Better service.

46:57.338 --> 46:59.546
Oh, also sometimes free shumai.

46:59.755 --> 47:01.630
Oh!

47:09.296 --> 47:10.130
Mm.

47:10.588 --> 47:11.880
Mm. Nope, nope.

47:18.671 --> 47:19.505
Wow.

47:19.796 --> 47:22.713
Every single car has a handicap pass.

47:22.796 --> 47:24.880
Chinese people are hella gangster.

47:24.963 --> 47:26.296
Look at that!

47:27.046 --> 47:29.130
Coming out of their cars all able-bodied.

47:31.421 --> 47:34.296
Hey! Hey, you guys are famous.

47:34.421 --> 47:35.796
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

47:35.880 --> 47:37.713
We're, uh, crushing it
in this neighborhood.

47:37.796 --> 47:38.880
Or, like, this block.

47:38.963 --> 47:41.296
Like, this half of this block,
we're big time.

47:41.380 --> 47:43.880
You make fun of it,
but your band could really be something.

47:44.255 --> 47:46.755
- Eh.
- What do you mean, "eh"?

47:46.838 --> 47:48.463
You used to talk about going
on a world tour.

47:48.546 --> 47:51.630
No, I can't.
My dad needs me here. I'm his caregiver.

47:51.796 --> 47:52.963
His caregiver?

47:53.046 --> 47:55.046
Harry seems like he can give care
to himself.

47:55.130 --> 47:57.171
Yeah, but he's getting older every day,
so...

47:57.255 --> 47:59.838
But don't you want more?
Even just creatively?

47:59.921 --> 48:02.255
Well, creatively I am writing a new song
called "Tennis Ball,"

48:02.338 --> 48:03.796
and I think it's really gonna connect.

48:03.880 --> 48:07.171
So you never wanna step outside
of this community, like, ever?

48:07.338 --> 48:08.213
No.

48:08.338 --> 48:09.588
Like, ever, ever?

48:09.671 --> 48:12.505
Sasha, I don't.
Okay? San Francisco's my home.

48:12.630 --> 48:14.588
These people are my family. I'm good.

48:14.796 --> 48:15.671
All right.

48:16.046 --> 48:16.963
No, that's cool.

48:20.463 --> 48:22.463
So, what are you gonna do
about Brandon?

48:22.546 --> 48:24.421
I guess I have to start dating again. Ugh.

48:24.505 --> 48:25.921
Is there anything worse?

48:26.005 --> 48:27.630
I don't know.
There are all those apps now.

48:27.880 --> 48:31.796
I saw one where a guy can't even message
a girl until he sends her a gift card.

48:31.880 --> 48:33.796
Well...

48:34.671 --> 48:36.838
Actually, if you want to know the truth,

48:36.921 --> 48:39.630
I was thinking I'd give dating
the old college try.

48:40.921 --> 48:42.755
But if it doesn't work out, um...

48:43.630 --> 48:45.588
maybe I'll just have a baby on my own.

48:46.213 --> 48:48.630
Really? You think you're at a place
to have a kid on your own?

48:48.713 --> 48:50.421
Why not? So it would only have one parent?

48:50.505 --> 48:53.005
So what? Not everyone has two parents.
I had no parents.

48:53.088 --> 48:54.505
Sasha, you had parents.

48:54.588 --> 48:55.421
I had me.

48:57.255 --> 48:59.505
All right. Don't get mad.
Do whatever you want.

48:59.588 --> 49:01.421
I don't need your go-ahead, Marcus,
but thank you.

49:02.463 --> 49:03.713
Hey, I have a big day tomorrow.

49:03.796 --> 49:05.963
I-- I'm catering a wrap party,
so I better get going.

49:06.046 --> 49:09.755
Oh, yeah, I got stuff, too, you know.
Important vent and duct stuff, so...

49:09.838 --> 49:12.671
- All right, well, my car's right there.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

49:12.755 --> 49:14.088
- Just--
- Oh, oh!

49:15.005 --> 49:16.213
Oh.

49:16.546 --> 49:18.171
- See you later.
- Okay, bye. See ya.

49:50.463 --> 49:53.213
Welcome, kuwakaribisha,

49:53.296 --> 49:57.421
to Kava Community Center's
slam poetry night!

49:57.505 --> 50:00.505
Yes!

50:02.713 --> 50:04.713
Sasha, this is amazing.

50:04.796 --> 50:07.421
- Thank you.
- I've never had this kind of food

50:07.505 --> 50:09.088
- at a wrap party.
- Yeah, it's really good.

50:28.380 --> 50:30.755
I hear you're responsible for all this.

50:30.880 --> 50:32.005
Yes, I am. I, uh--

50:32.796 --> 50:34.088
Oh, my God.

50:35.130 --> 50:37.338
And then after the show,

50:37.421 --> 50:40.171
Jenny gave every kid
a hand-painted ceramic swan.

50:40.630 --> 50:41.796
That's so sweet.

50:44.630 --> 50:45.755
Why are you grunting?

50:46.338 --> 50:48.588
'Cause I've always had my doubts
about Jenny.

50:49.546 --> 50:50.880
What? No, you haven't.

50:50.963 --> 50:53.088
I have.
I just didn't wanna meddle.

50:53.296 --> 50:54.255
But now you do.

50:54.796 --> 50:55.671
Yeah.

50:56.046 --> 50:56.880
Why?

50:57.838 --> 50:59.005
You know why.

50:59.088 --> 51:01.296
Oh, my God. You got, like,
a lot of dead skin on your face.

51:03.546 --> 51:05.338
Just say whatever it is you want to say.

51:05.421 --> 51:06.630
Because of Sasha.

51:06.838 --> 51:08.505
You and Sasha are great together.

51:08.588 --> 51:09.838
You always have been.

51:09.921 --> 51:12.630
Sasha thinks she knows everything
about everything.

51:12.755 --> 51:15.546
Plus, she's a celebrity now,
and all celebrities are insane.

51:15.630 --> 51:18.755
I once saw Glenn Close order
a pineapple sandwich.

51:19.171 --> 51:21.546
Jenny is a kind and compassionate person.

51:21.630 --> 51:23.296
And she cares about the community.

51:23.380 --> 51:25.213
And Sasha is Sasha.

51:25.838 --> 51:28.088
There's no one else like her,
and you know it.

51:29.505 --> 51:30.963
You do know it, don't you?

51:33.546 --> 51:34.713
That's what I thought.

51:35.338 --> 51:39.046
You don't want to wonder, "What if?"
Tell her how you feel, son.

52:12.005 --> 52:13.671
Great, thanks for meeting me here.

52:13.755 --> 52:15.630
- Oh, I'm so glad you texted me.
- You are?

52:15.713 --> 52:17.338
- Yes! I have some news.
- So do I.

52:17.421 --> 52:18.630
- Mine's big.
- Mine's big, too.

52:18.880 --> 52:20.380
Okay, look, um...

52:20.630 --> 52:22.546
So I was talking to my dad, and, uh--

52:22.630 --> 52:25.921
Okay, I wanna go first! I met someone.

52:28.546 --> 52:31.713
- Um, when?
- At that wrap party I catered.

52:31.796 --> 52:34.005
Marcus, he's amazing.

52:34.088 --> 52:37.130
I can't believe
a guy like this is actually into me.

52:37.213 --> 52:39.713
And I don't normally broadcast
this kind of thing, but...

52:39.796 --> 52:43.088
we had the most insane, freaky-ass sex.

52:43.171 --> 52:46.046
My toes are curled up right now
just thinking about it.

52:46.588 --> 52:49.338
And look, look!
I have a hickey, like a teenager.

52:49.421 --> 52:52.130
What? That looks like it hurt.

52:52.421 --> 52:54.838
- Like, a lot.
- Oh, my God, and this guy, Marcus,

52:54.921 --> 52:57.463
he has, like,
the best qualities of Brandon

52:57.546 --> 52:58.380
but...

52:58.796 --> 52:59.630
even better.

52:59.921 --> 53:02.338
Better than Brandon.
Wow, that's-- That's so great.

53:02.421 --> 53:03.338
- Right?
- Yeah.

53:03.505 --> 53:04.838
So... So, what's your news?

53:04.921 --> 53:06.171
- Something about your dad?
- It's...

53:06.755 --> 53:09.421
Uh, well, it's not, like,
news, but I just wanted to see if,

53:09.505 --> 53:12.296
you know, you wanted to have dinner

53:12.380 --> 53:14.713
- with Jenny and me. That's it.
- That's your big news?

53:14.796 --> 53:16.088
Well, how about a double date?

53:16.630 --> 53:19.046
- Uh, yes.
- And you can meet him!

53:19.130 --> 53:20.713
- Amazing.
- Your mind's gonna be blown.

53:21.046 --> 53:22.505
Oh, yeah, it's-- Yeah.

53:22.588 --> 53:25.671
Okay, that looks like you might need
to see a doctor or something.

53:37.546 --> 53:40.963
I thought this was a high-end restaurant.
Why am I the only one wearing a tux?

53:41.171 --> 53:44.963
Oh, sorry, I should have told you.
Rich people are done with fancy clothes.

53:45.046 --> 53:48.130
Now it's all $1,000 T-shirts that look
like they were stolen off the homeless.

53:50.588 --> 53:52.838
- Jenny's dressed perfect.
- Oh!

53:54.338 --> 53:55.796
So where's your man?

53:56.838 --> 53:58.796
Oh! There he is!

53:58.880 --> 54:00.255
♪ Sail ♪

54:14.838 --> 54:18.255
Oh, my God!

54:19.046 --> 54:22.755
I think that guy is Keanu Reeves.

54:23.380 --> 54:26.005
Hey, boo.

54:26.546 --> 54:30.546
♪ This is how an angel cries ♪

54:31.463 --> 54:35.255

54:38.213 --> 54:40.171
I wanted to surprise you.

54:40.796 --> 54:42.588
I took a photo of your faces. Look!

54:42.796 --> 54:43.838
You guys look so shocked.

54:44.171 --> 54:45.505
You only capture that shit once!

54:51.130 --> 54:52.505
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, baby.

54:58.380 --> 54:59.880
- I've missed you.
- I missed you, too.

54:59.963 --> 55:02.005
- I've missed you so much.
- I missed your mouth.

55:02.088 --> 55:03.338
I missed your heart.

55:03.421 --> 55:05.671
- Oh, God, I missed your beard.
- I missed your light.

55:05.755 --> 55:06.713
Oh.

55:06.880 --> 55:08.880
- I missed your chin.
- I missed your soul.

55:08.963 --> 55:10.005
I missed your ass.

55:10.088 --> 55:11.088
I missed your spirit.

55:11.171 --> 55:12.296
I missed your thumbs.

55:12.380 --> 55:14.213
- I missed your eyes.
- You're so good with your thumbs.

55:14.296 --> 55:16.921
I missed how you smell. Oh, my God.

55:17.088 --> 55:18.880
Um, these are, uh, my friends.

55:19.130 --> 55:22.130
- Uh, this is Marcus, and this is Jenny.
- Hi, Jenny.

55:25.296 --> 55:26.213
- Wow.
- Wow.

55:27.213 --> 55:30.380
Now I know what it feels like
to be completely starstruck.

55:31.338 --> 55:32.880
The only stars that matter...

55:34.255 --> 55:36.505
are the ones you look at when you dream.

55:37.296 --> 55:39.338
Thank you.

55:41.546 --> 55:42.588
A pleasure to meet you, Marcus.

55:42.838 --> 55:46.338
Likewise, Keanu. I-- I love your outfit.

55:46.963 --> 55:48.671
- Oh, thanks, man.
- Yeah.

55:48.880 --> 55:51.255
- Tom Ford made it custom for me.
- Wow.

55:51.921 --> 55:54.380
- I-- I didn't know you wore glasses.
- Oh, I don't.

55:54.463 --> 55:55.921
My eyes are perfect.

55:56.380 --> 56:00.005
This is for a part.
They don't even have lenses in them.

56:00.505 --> 56:01.505
- See?
- Wow.

56:01.588 --> 56:02.421
Nope.

56:04.671 --> 56:06.671
I love the suit. Classic.

56:06.755 --> 56:09.421
Thank you, thank you.
It's my, uh, old tux from prom.

56:09.505 --> 56:10.380
That's great.

56:10.755 --> 56:13.046
I dropped out of high school,
went to work.

56:13.963 --> 56:15.088
Followed my dream.

56:18.213 --> 56:19.171
Shall we?

56:23.296 --> 56:25.088
- You are stunning.
- Oh, my God.

56:25.546 --> 56:27.088
- You look good.
- What?

56:27.963 --> 56:28.963
You look good.

56:30.755 --> 56:31.588
Let's feast.

56:33.463 --> 56:35.588
- Hey, Charles.
- Good to see you again, Mr. Reeves.

56:35.671 --> 56:36.505
You, too.

56:36.671 --> 56:37.546
Hey...

56:38.213 --> 56:39.213
may I ask...

56:39.546 --> 56:42.671
do you have any dishes
that play with time?

56:42.963 --> 56:44.880
The concept of time.

56:45.005 --> 56:45.963
Ah!

56:46.421 --> 56:47.296
Yes,

56:47.380 --> 56:49.921
we have a meat course
of venison sous vide.

56:50.005 --> 56:51.588
It comes with headphones
so you can hear the sound

56:51.671 --> 56:53.838
of the exact animal
you are about to consume,

56:53.921 --> 56:56.171
illustrating nature's life to death cycle.

56:58.963 --> 57:02.255
And of course, everything you see
on the table tonight is edible.

57:02.338 --> 57:04.755
Yas!

57:05.880 --> 57:07.171
- Wait, so is this--
- No.

57:07.255 --> 57:08.213
Not the napkin, sir.

57:08.421 --> 57:09.921
Don't eat the napkin, Marcus.

57:12.588 --> 57:14.421
Microgreens
and lettuces encapsulated

57:14.505 --> 57:17.255
and served with dehydrated seaweed
and dried fish flakes.

57:18.005 --> 57:19.213
Sorry, fish food?

57:19.296 --> 57:20.713
- Fish flakes.
- Right.

57:20.796 --> 57:22.046
Which is fish food.

57:22.296 --> 57:24.588
We lightly scale the body
of the fish as it swims

57:24.671 --> 57:26.796
collecting the particles it sheds
into the ocean.

57:26.880 --> 57:27.713
Oh, got it.

57:27.796 --> 57:29.046
So it's fish dandruff.

57:33.213 --> 57:34.755
Clear asparagus soup

57:35.046 --> 57:37.296
extracted with a centrifuge.

57:37.380 --> 57:39.088
The all-black monochrome course.

57:40.171 --> 57:41.713
The flavor of Caesar salad.

57:41.796 --> 57:43.213
Mm!

57:43.671 --> 57:46.130
Mm! Mm!

58:19.088 --> 58:20.630
I'm sorry.

58:25.838 --> 58:28.088
And to finish,
crystallized lavender sugar bubbles,

58:28.171 --> 58:29.463
prepared by Wallace.

58:29.796 --> 58:31.296
Wait. How come--

58:31.380 --> 58:32.713
Wow! Mm!

58:33.671 --> 58:34.796
- Ah!
- Ooh, wow!

58:34.880 --> 58:36.380
It tastes like a cloud.

58:36.463 --> 58:38.505
- So, Henry--
- It's Marcus.

58:38.588 --> 58:39.755
So, Marcus...

58:40.296 --> 58:41.338
I hear you're in a band.

58:41.546 --> 58:42.921
Oh! They are so awesome.

58:43.046 --> 58:44.963
They could be really huge
if they wanted to be.

58:45.046 --> 58:47.171
Have I heard of you guys
on the festival circuit?

58:47.255 --> 58:49.046
Uh, no, we're just the block band.

58:49.130 --> 58:49.963
See...

58:50.296 --> 58:51.505
that right there...

58:51.588 --> 58:52.963
is what it's all about.

58:53.630 --> 58:55.796
Laboring in obscurity.

58:56.088 --> 58:57.630
Starving and struggling.

58:58.130 --> 59:01.338
The man who embraces
his mediocre nothingness...

59:01.921 --> 59:03.255
shines greater...

59:04.546 --> 59:05.421
than any.

59:07.630 --> 59:08.671
Thank you, Keanu.

59:09.171 --> 59:10.755
- Uh, to Marcus.
- To Marcus.

59:10.838 --> 59:13.921
To Marcus, via Keanu's wise words.

59:14.963 --> 59:18.463
Will you excuse me?
After a meal, I like to stretch my legs.

59:18.880 --> 59:20.796
- Visit with your friends.
- Okay.

59:20.880 --> 59:23.130
- I'm going to get some air.
- I love air.

59:23.921 --> 59:25.838
Let's get some air.

59:28.921 --> 59:29.921
Hey. Hey, don't be weird

59:30.005 --> 59:32.296
about that nothingness thing, huh?
It was a compliment.

59:32.463 --> 59:34.796
- That's just how he phrases things.
- Mm-hmm.

59:35.380 --> 59:38.880
So, what do you think about him otherwise?

59:38.963 --> 59:41.671
Well, you know,
I think he could dial down the theatrics

59:41.755 --> 59:43.421
by, like, 10,000.

59:44.255 --> 59:45.213
Well, he's an actor.

59:45.296 --> 59:46.338
He's a douche.

59:46.421 --> 59:48.588
- Marcus.
- What? You asked me what I thought.

59:48.671 --> 59:49.921
Yeah, well, I really like him.

59:50.005 --> 59:51.296
He's really good--

59:51.380 --> 59:53.838
Shall we continue our evening elsewhere?

59:53.921 --> 59:56.546
Take the party back to my hotel
for a nightcap?

59:56.630 --> 59:58.630
Yes, that would be so much fun.

59:58.713 --> 01:00:01.380
- Um, what about the bill?
- I took care of it.

01:00:01.921 --> 01:00:04.338
Saying I had to get some air
was just a charade.

01:00:05.088 --> 01:00:08.463
Oh, um, you didn't even give me a chance
to fight you for it.

01:00:08.546 --> 01:00:10.005
It's $6,400.

01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:13.588
Less than a residual paycheck
from my hit movie Speed...

01:00:14.213 --> 01:00:16.755
but... a little out of your ballpark.

01:00:19.088 --> 01:00:20.255
But it's okay.

01:00:21.171 --> 01:00:22.130
Thank you.

01:00:23.255 --> 01:00:25.505
- I'm going to get the chariot.
- Okay.

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:26.713
I'll get our bags.

01:00:29.671 --> 01:00:30.880
Look, okay... I--

01:00:30.963 --> 01:00:33.171
I can see
how you would misconstrue that...

01:00:34.255 --> 01:00:35.546
cupping of the face thing,

01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:38.255
but I know him,
and it was an honest show of affection.

01:00:38.338 --> 01:00:41.255
Yeah, he's great.
Everything about him, great.

01:00:42.421 --> 01:00:45.046
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means what it means.

01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:47.380
If you're implying
something negative about Keanu,

01:00:47.463 --> 01:00:48.796
have you taken a look at Jenny?

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.880
Jenny's a good person.
Jenny helps children.

01:00:50.963 --> 01:00:53.796
Keanu helps children, too, probably.
He's helped a lot of people.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.588
He was the greatest North American
box office draw

01:00:55.671 --> 01:00:56.880
of the '90s and early 2000s.

01:00:56.963 --> 01:00:58.255
- Then I'm wrong.
- You are wrong.

01:00:58.338 --> 01:00:59.963
You're wrong
about a lot of things in life.

01:01:00.046 --> 01:01:01.588
Well, I'm not wrong about the fact

01:01:01.671 --> 01:01:04.463
that I'm hungry as hell
after a $6,400 dinner.

01:01:04.546 --> 01:01:08.005
Hey! Can I get a monochrome burrito to go?

01:01:10.838 --> 01:01:13.630
Just kidding. Kidding.
Very full.

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:17.505
Glad I wore my Spanx. See?

01:01:31.505 --> 01:01:35.671
- ♪ I'm the man in the box... ♪
- Oh... my... God.

01:01:36.213 --> 01:01:37.963
Are you serious?

01:01:38.796 --> 01:01:40.255
Uh, hello?

01:01:41.005 --> 01:01:43.463

01:01:48.130 --> 01:01:51.963

01:01:53.588 --> 01:01:57.296
Whoa. This place is lit!

01:01:57.713 --> 01:01:59.046
- Welcome.
- Come on in.

01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:01.005
Wow.

01:02:01.088 --> 01:02:02.713
You guys want to play a game
or something?

01:02:02.796 --> 01:02:04.921
We can call the front desk
and see if they have Cranium.

01:02:05.005 --> 01:02:07.463
You know,
the stunt coordinator for John Wick

01:02:07.546 --> 01:02:09.213
taught me this game he invented.

01:02:09.671 --> 01:02:13.796
It's called "Icebreaker."
It's like Truth or Dare, but...

01:02:14.546 --> 01:02:15.671
a little more...

01:02:16.213 --> 01:02:18.296
- apocalyptic.
- Ooh!

01:02:18.546 --> 01:02:20.338
Sure you don't wanna play charades?

01:02:20.421 --> 01:02:21.421
I heard that.

01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:24.546
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

01:02:25.921 --> 01:02:27.713
- Cheers, baby.
- Cheers.

01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:30.338
- Ow!
- Oh.

01:02:30.838 --> 01:02:32.005
- Marcus.
- Sorry.

01:02:33.130 --> 01:02:34.005
My turn.

01:02:35.921 --> 01:02:37.588
Ooh, this is a good one.

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:41.046
Who was your childhood crush?

01:02:41.671 --> 01:02:42.505
Mine...

01:02:42.921 --> 01:02:44.046
was Mother Teresa.

01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:45.463
Oh, come on.

01:02:45.546 --> 01:02:47.505
Martin Luther King Jr.

01:02:47.588 --> 01:02:49.713
- What?
- Yes!

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:54.588
Um...
My childhood crush was...

01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:57.046
Marcus Kim.

01:02:57.421 --> 01:02:58.546
What?

01:02:59.838 --> 01:03:02.171
- Him?
- When? For those two hours?

01:03:02.255 --> 01:03:03.588
The car and Burger King?

01:03:03.671 --> 01:03:07.005
No. The entire time.
Eighteen years, I had a crush on you.

01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:08.421
No, you didn't.

01:03:08.546 --> 01:03:10.088
- Yes, I did.
- The whole time?

01:03:10.171 --> 01:03:12.130
Yeah. Thank you for noticing.

01:03:12.213 --> 01:03:15.380
Even when you told me I make
weird facial expressions when I dance?

01:03:15.463 --> 01:03:19.838
That was a neg. I was negging you.
It was supposed to make you like me.

01:03:21.255 --> 01:03:25.005
- Why didn't you just say it straight out?
- Because... Marcus, I don't know.

01:03:25.088 --> 01:03:27.505
I was young, and dumb,
and scared that you didn't like me back--

01:03:27.588 --> 01:03:30.171
You should have said it. We would have...
I mean...

01:03:30.421 --> 01:03:32.546
I always thought maybe,

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:35.838
- but, I-- I mean--
- Icebreaker is best played

01:03:35.921 --> 01:03:40.213
at a pace...
and you two are slowing it down.

01:03:40.296 --> 01:03:42.713
Oh, don't worry. That was a long time ago,

01:03:42.796 --> 01:03:45.171
and it's been 16 eye-opening years since.

01:03:45.588 --> 01:03:46.838
Right?

01:03:47.088 --> 01:03:48.088
Anyway...

01:03:48.338 --> 01:03:50.005
- Who's next?
- He's next.

01:03:51.338 --> 01:03:52.171
More wine.

01:03:52.296 --> 01:03:55.255
Yes, please!

01:03:55.505 --> 01:03:57.505
I love this game.

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:00.838
I feel so close to you guys.

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:03.713
This game is so deep.

01:04:04.046 --> 01:04:04.880
It's your turn.

01:04:04.963 --> 01:04:06.505
- It's my turn.
- It's your turn.

01:04:06.588 --> 01:04:07.713
It's your turn, Keanu.

01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:21.671
Who is the most disturbing person
you've ever masturbated to?

01:04:21.755 --> 01:04:23.171
Oh...

01:04:23.505 --> 01:04:25.338
Um, Gene Wilder.

01:04:25.421 --> 01:04:26.505
Mao Zedong.

01:04:30.755 --> 01:04:35.380
Um... Uh, Princess Jasmine
with her midriff top.

01:04:35.463 --> 01:04:36.713
A cartoon?

01:04:36.796 --> 01:04:39.588
Wow! That's disgusting.

01:04:40.255 --> 01:04:42.421
- And Gene Wilder isn't?
- Hey!

01:04:42.505 --> 01:04:44.088
Gene Wilder is a cinematic treasure.

01:04:44.171 --> 01:04:47.005
What about Mao Zedong?
Have you seen a picture of him?

01:04:47.088 --> 01:04:47.921
Of course I have.

01:04:48.005 --> 01:04:50.671
I'm very familiar
with Chinese dignitaries, Marcus.

01:04:51.130 --> 01:04:52.171
Xi Jinping.

01:04:52.671 --> 01:04:53.713
Li Keqiang.

01:04:54.046 --> 01:04:56.296
Okay, Keanu, you know everything!

01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:58.796
- Fine, I get it.
- Okay! Okay, guys!

01:04:59.255 --> 01:05:00.963
This is just a game, right?

01:05:02.463 --> 01:05:03.921
All right.

01:05:06.088 --> 01:05:08.963
If you had to choose one person
in this room to die,

01:05:09.838 --> 01:05:11.421
- who would it be?
- Marcus!

01:05:11.505 --> 01:05:12.546
Whoa! All right.

01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:14.963
Men should be able
to face their death head-on.

01:05:15.046 --> 01:05:16.921
That's fine. I'd kill you, too, Keanu.

01:05:17.005 --> 01:05:19.255
I'd kill you just for fun,
even if I didn't have to.

01:05:19.338 --> 01:05:21.796
Okay, why don't we play Cranium?
Right, Jenny? Cranium...

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.130
I'd kill Marcus.

01:05:23.463 --> 01:05:24.838
- What?
- I'm sorry.

01:05:25.921 --> 01:05:30.171
But Keanu and Sasha's cultural footprints
are way bigger than yours, babe.

01:05:30.713 --> 01:05:33.630
I just couldn't do that to the world.

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:37.046
All right, that's great. You know what?
Um, I don't wanna play this game anymore.

01:05:37.255 --> 01:05:38.338
Why, Marcus?

01:05:39.171 --> 01:05:40.755
What is it about this game...

01:05:42.463 --> 01:05:43.588
that frightens you?

01:05:43.921 --> 01:05:45.796
I'm not frightened, Keanu.

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:49.296
You know what? Fine.
Um, I dare you to...

01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:51.213
smash that vase on your head.

You see how easy that was?

01:06:08.838 --> 01:06:11.963
I never cower in the face of danger.

"Strike you"? What does that even mean?

01:06:18.755 --> 01:06:20.171
I'm feeling an energy from you...

01:06:20.838 --> 01:06:22.421

01:07:14.588 --> 01:07:16.171
about the community center.

You can't change the world

you'd kill Keanu just for fun?

You need someone on your arm that badly?

01:07:57.671 --> 01:07:58.796
Just stop talking, please.

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.671
And this whole thing
about having a kid by yourself

01:08:00.755 --> 01:08:02.838
if you don't meet someone
in the next five minutes.

01:08:02.921 --> 01:08:04.921
I should not have told you that.
Do not repeat that to anyone.

01:08:05.005 --> 01:08:07.088
- People are gonna know if you do it.
- Maybe not.

01:08:07.171 --> 01:08:10.171
Maybe I'll lie and say the dad died
getting trampled at the Women's March.

01:08:10.255 --> 01:08:11.463
- Great idea, Sasha.
- Very noble.

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:14.130
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Lie to everyone
just like you lie to yourself.

01:08:14.213 --> 01:08:16.380
- I don't lie to myself.
- You can't sit still!

01:08:16.462 --> 01:08:18.255
You just go and go and go,

01:08:18.337 --> 01:08:20.796
and you fill your life up
with these awards,

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.671
and deals, and these idiot boyfriends
who are obviously wrong for you,

01:08:23.755 --> 01:08:26.837
and you lie to yourself that any of it
is ever, ever going to make you feel

01:08:26.921 --> 01:08:29.671
- even slightly less miserable.
- Well, what about you?

01:08:29.755 --> 01:08:32.171
Stuck at home with your dad and that car?

01:08:32.421 --> 01:08:34.505
You have all this talent,
and you waste it.

01:08:34.587 --> 01:08:35.587
You do shit with it.

01:08:35.671 --> 01:08:38.712
And you say it's because you don't need
all that and you're happy, but really...

01:08:38.837 --> 01:08:40.421
it's because you're scared.

01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:46.712
Well, now you have nothing to say to me?

01:08:49.421 --> 01:08:50.462
What are you doing?

01:08:52.212 --> 01:08:55.296
I don't know.

- No.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.046

the worst option on purpose.

I can't believe it.
She always seemed so sweet in her movies.

01:12:59.713 --> 01:13:02.296
Just because somebody
plays a singing teapot in a Disney movie

01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:04.713
doesn't mean they're always nice, Marcus.

01:13:07.421 --> 01:13:09.171
It's nice to see you like this again.

01:13:09.463 --> 01:13:10.421
Like what?

01:13:10.505 --> 01:13:12.213
- Yourself.
- Well...

01:13:13.046 --> 01:13:14.255
thanks for reminding me how it feels.

01:13:15.255 --> 01:13:16.338
How what feels?

01:13:17.088 --> 01:13:18.421
Home.

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:21.838
I love that you're back home.

01:13:27.588 --> 01:13:30.463
Veronica, Denise, she's so beautiful.

01:13:30.546 --> 01:13:32.838
- Thank you.
- Isn't she amazing?

01:13:32.921 --> 01:13:34.671
I can't stop staring at her.

01:13:34.755 --> 01:13:36.130
I mean, no pressure,

01:13:36.213 --> 01:13:38.171
but I feel like
I'm a total natural godmother,

01:13:38.255 --> 01:13:39.588
like the way I'm cradling her.

01:13:39.671 --> 01:13:42.171
You're great.
You just can't cradle her from New York.

01:13:42.255 --> 01:13:43.796
Bitch, I will be her fairy godmother.

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.546
Okay? I will flit back and forth

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:47.171
to wherever she is, like a fairy.

01:13:47.255 --> 01:13:48.505
Okay, the fact that you said "bitch"

01:13:48.588 --> 01:13:50.713
while you're holding my baby means
that you are not ready.

01:13:51.213 --> 01:13:53.546
Um, so you're still planning
to go to New York?

01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:54.838
Yeah. I have to be on-site

01:13:54.921 --> 01:13:57.046
to get the restaurant up and running.

01:13:57.130 --> 01:14:00.755
Oh, I... I just, I don't know.
I thought you'd stay here for a while.

01:14:01.963 --> 01:14:05.130
I was actually hoping you'd come with me.
It'd be so fun to be there with you.

01:14:05.463 --> 01:14:08.588
I'm sure they have dive bars in New York
where you can play for free.

01:14:09.046 --> 01:14:09.880
Right?

01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:12.130
Yes. Godmother Sasha.

01:14:12.463 --> 01:14:15.880
- I'm gonna godmother the shit out of you.
- That's another strike.

01:14:31.546 --> 01:14:34.671
I thought you said fancy was out.
These dudes are all wearing tuxedos.

01:14:34.755 --> 01:14:35.796
No, you're fine.

01:14:36.046 --> 01:14:38.046
They'll just assume you're a K-pop Star.

01:14:39.838 --> 01:14:41.005
Coats required, sir.

01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:43.588
Shit.

01:14:45.755 --> 01:14:47.671
You don't have anything less roomy?

01:14:47.755 --> 01:14:49.005
This is all we have, sir.

01:14:49.505 --> 01:14:50.505
What about those?

01:14:50.963 --> 01:14:52.588
No. Those aren't available.

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:54.880
- They're not available?
- No, they belong to people.

01:14:54.963 --> 01:14:57.255
Right, and this one doesn't belong
to people,

01:14:57.338 --> 01:15:00.880
- because nobody is this big, right?
- The gentleman died, sir.

01:15:00.963 --> 01:15:02.963
- The person who owned this died?
- Yes, that's correct.

01:15:03.046 --> 01:15:04.296
Oh, André the Giant.

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:07.255
- It was André the Giant?
- He was a larger gentleman.

01:15:12.046 --> 01:15:15.005
You look like 1980s Ellen
when she did stand-up.

01:15:15.630 --> 01:15:18.546
Shut up. I am doing this for you.

01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:20.630
Hey, you're pulling it off. It's okay.

01:15:22.046 --> 01:15:24.963
Good evening.
Lamb carpaccio with a Caesar ice cream?

01:15:25.046 --> 01:15:26.838
Absolutely not, thank you.

01:15:27.796 --> 01:15:28.630
Quail egg parfait?

01:15:28.713 --> 01:15:30.963
Rather shoot myself in the face, thanks.

01:15:32.338 --> 01:15:33.588
What? I said thank you.

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:36.880
Sorry, I have to do
this red carpet thing real quick, okay?

01:15:36.963 --> 01:15:38.171
Okay.

01:15:40.130 --> 01:15:41.338
Can you hold my purse?

01:15:41.963 --> 01:15:43.255
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Great.

01:15:46.463 --> 01:15:47.755
Hey! Love it!

01:15:47.838 --> 01:15:51.755
Sasha, smile!
Smile! You look gorgeous!

01:15:51.838 --> 01:15:53.713
- Yeah.
- Thank you, Sasha.

01:15:54.338 --> 01:15:57.546
Sasha! Tell us about your new
San Francisco restaurant, Saintly Fare.

01:15:57.630 --> 01:16:00.171
Oh, all I can say is it's gonna be
something different, innovative.

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:02.380
- Love it!
- How are you handling the breakup

01:16:02.463 --> 01:16:03.380
with Brandon Choi?

01:16:03.463 --> 01:16:05.130
I wish Brandon nothing but the best.

01:16:05.213 --> 01:16:08.046
It was just time for us
to go in different directions.

01:16:08.213 --> 01:16:09.921
But I'm here tonight
with my new boyfriend,

01:16:10.546 --> 01:16:11.755
Marcus Kim.

01:16:12.963 --> 01:16:17.130
- Is he a chef, too?
- No, no, no, he's in heat and air.

01:16:17.213 --> 01:16:18.755
He's just a regular guy.

01:16:20.088 --> 01:16:22.213
Sasha, nice to see you.

01:16:30.546 --> 01:16:33.338
God, I can't believe
we're opening Saintly Fare tonight.

01:16:33.421 --> 01:16:34.921
Phew, I'm nervous.

01:16:35.296 --> 01:16:37.213
You thought the last event was crazy?

01:16:37.296 --> 01:16:38.755
Wait till you see what it's like

01:16:38.838 --> 01:16:40.921
- opening night of a restaurant.
- Hmm.

01:16:41.046 --> 01:16:43.713
I'm just glad this is the last thing
for a while.

01:16:43.796 --> 01:16:44.713
Well...

01:16:44.796 --> 01:16:47.463
not really. Remember,
I'm off to New York next week.

01:16:47.921 --> 01:16:49.296
You're still coming, right?

01:16:50.088 --> 01:16:51.296
Oh, um...

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:54.921
Well, I'm not sure I can, I got my dad
and that Southie's audition, so...

01:16:55.421 --> 01:16:56.921
So, come after the audition.

01:16:57.255 --> 01:17:00.880
Well, maybe. We'll see.
So, when are you planning on coming back?

01:17:02.046 --> 01:17:02.880
I wasn't.

01:17:03.921 --> 01:17:06.338
I'm... moving on to the next thing.

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:07.588
You know?

01:17:08.255 --> 01:17:11.546
Oh, right. Right.
It's because you're a celebrity chef.

01:17:11.755 --> 01:17:13.921
Who came up with that term anyway?

01:17:14.005 --> 01:17:15.255
It's so pretentious.

01:17:15.505 --> 01:17:17.505
Great, well, it wasn't me, okay?

01:17:20.171 --> 01:17:21.796
You know what other term I hate?

01:17:22.046 --> 01:17:23.796
"Elevated Asian cuisine."

01:17:24.130 --> 01:17:27.255
Asian food isn't supposed to be
"elevated." It's supposed to be authentic.

01:17:27.338 --> 01:17:29.213
That's what you used to make with my mom.

01:17:29.296 --> 01:17:31.338
I don't know why you're doing
this kinda stuff now.

01:17:31.421 --> 01:17:34.296
Oh, so now you're saying
my food isn't authentic.

01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:35.671
It's not authentic.

01:17:35.755 --> 01:17:37.921
Asian food shouldn't be served
in a shot glass.

01:17:38.005 --> 01:17:39.838
It should be served in a big ass bowl.

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:42.130
You're just catering to rich white people.

01:17:42.213 --> 01:17:45.213
Well, if you think I'm such a sellout,
then why are you dating me?

01:17:45.296 --> 01:17:48.046
If you think I'm just a regular guy,
then why are you dating me?

01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:48.963
Oh, I know,

01:17:49.046 --> 01:17:50.588
it's because you need someone
to carry your purse.

01:17:50.671 --> 01:17:53.005
I called you "a regular guy"
as a compliment.

01:17:53.088 --> 01:17:55.380
- You aren't caught up in all the bullshit.
- The way you are?

01:17:55.463 --> 01:17:56.463
Oh, right.

01:17:56.630 --> 01:18:00.880
Instead, you smoke weed every night
'cause that's so much more noble.

01:18:00.963 --> 01:18:03.671
God forbid someone relax
in Sasha Tran's presence.

01:18:03.755 --> 01:18:06.130
Don't shame me
for going after things, Marcus!

01:18:06.213 --> 01:18:08.338
- You're so scared to do anything new.
- I'm not scared.

01:18:08.421 --> 01:18:11.463
Okay? I just don't want to be some dude
on your arm

01:18:11.546 --> 01:18:12.921
so you don't have to show up
to places alone.

01:18:13.005 --> 01:18:13.963
Why not?

01:18:14.046 --> 01:18:16.213
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with you supporting me?

01:18:16.755 --> 01:18:18.671
No one would question it
if it was the other way around.

01:18:18.755 --> 01:18:19.963
You don't support me.

01:18:20.046 --> 01:18:22.046
You hate the band. You hate Ragga.

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:23.296
I don't hate the band!

01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:24.755
I think the band is great.

01:18:25.171 --> 01:18:27.213
Too great to be stuck playing
in that shithole!

01:18:27.296 --> 01:18:29.005
Well, I love that shithole!

01:18:29.421 --> 01:18:31.921
Sorry if it isn't "elevated" enough
for you.

01:18:33.005 --> 01:18:35.796
You know what, Marcus? Don't come tonight.

01:18:43.546 --> 01:18:44.463
Sasha!

01:18:48.005 --> 01:18:50.213
- Sasha, look, I didn't mean to--
- I love you, Marcus.

01:18:52.296 --> 01:18:54.130
I've loved you since we were kids.

01:18:55.671 --> 01:18:57.213
And I don't need you to live my life,

01:18:57.296 --> 01:18:59.796
but I need you to understand
that this is my life.

01:19:00.796 --> 01:19:01.963
I want to be with you.

01:19:02.046 --> 01:19:05.296
I want to come home to you,
even when you're being an asshole.

01:19:06.838 --> 01:19:08.630
After the opening,
I'm gonna go to New York,

01:19:08.713 --> 01:19:11.088
and if you don't want to come with me,
then just say it.

01:19:18.463 --> 01:19:20.338
I don't want to go to New York with you.

01:19:23.130 --> 01:19:24.838

Yeah, I'm fine.

01:20:20.255 --> 01:20:22.338
I came here to open the restaurant,
and that's what I did.

01:20:22.421 --> 01:20:24.130
- On to the next.
- Ok. I know this is gonna make you mad,

01:20:24.213 --> 01:20:25.755

and think, "Maybe if I tried harder--"

01:20:33.671 --> 01:20:35.255
- What am I supposed to do?
- Just talk to Marcus.

01:20:35.338 --> 01:20:37.171
I'm done talking to Marcus.

01:20:37.838 --> 01:20:40.088
I'll call you from New York.

01:20:41.005 --> 01:20:43.255
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:20:56.171 --> 01:20:57.630
Hey, dad, I got us some Panera Bread--

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:00.213
- Dad?
- Marcus.

01:21:00.296 --> 01:21:01.921
- Donna Summer?
- Diana Ross.

01:21:02.046 --> 01:21:03.338
- Kathy.
- Dad!

01:21:03.588 --> 01:21:04.421
Marcus.

01:21:05.463 --> 01:21:08.838
Okay, now that we've all met,
who wants some dinner?

01:21:12.005 --> 01:21:14.713
- How long has this been going on?
- For a while now.

01:21:15.046 --> 01:21:18.255
We hit it off at the party,
and you know how much I love Diana Ross.

01:21:18.338 --> 01:21:19.671
How come you never told me?

01:21:21.713 --> 01:21:23.213
I didn't know how you'd react.

01:21:25.963 --> 01:21:27.505
Did Sasha leave for New York?

01:21:27.588 --> 01:21:29.505
Um, yeah. Yeah, she did.

01:21:30.421 --> 01:21:31.421
Why didn't you go with her?

01:21:31.630 --> 01:21:32.463
Well...

01:21:32.838 --> 01:21:35.463
Because I have responsibilities here,
you know?

01:21:35.546 --> 01:21:37.296
I got the business, the band, you.

01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:39.880
- I'm your caregiver.
- What the hell are you talking about?

01:21:39.963 --> 01:21:41.921
- I don't need a caregiver.
- Yes, you do, Dad.

01:21:42.005 --> 01:21:44.005
You think I can't stick a needle
in my own ass?

01:21:44.088 --> 01:21:45.088
Well, why have I been doing it?

01:21:45.171 --> 01:21:47.213
You're using me as an excuse
not to live your life.

01:21:47.296 --> 01:21:48.130
You need me, okay?

01:21:48.213 --> 01:21:50.255
You lost Mom.

01:21:51.213 --> 01:21:52.380
I can't leave you, too.

01:21:58.338 --> 01:22:00.296
We both lost your mom.

01:22:01.255 --> 01:22:03.880
And as hard as it was,
it was her time to go.

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:08.130
Now, I thought if I gave you space,

01:22:08.213 --> 01:22:10.630
someday you'd be able to let go
and move on.

01:22:12.546 --> 01:22:15.546
But you just sat there
and let the world pass you by.

01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:18.963
It kills me seeing you like this

01:22:19.046 --> 01:22:21.463
because I know it would have broken
your mother's heart.

01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:25.463
Hey, at some point...

01:22:26.838 --> 01:22:29.546
you're gonna have to take a chance
on something, son.

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:38.505

01:23:00.796 --> 01:23:01.671
Breakup.

01:23:02.255 --> 01:23:03.338
You and Sasha broke up?

- What? When did that happen?
- Hey, check it out.

01:23:06.213 --> 01:23:08.463
It is audition night at Southie's.

01:23:08.546 --> 01:23:11.546

You know, you don't care about the band.
You don't care about us.

01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:45.380
Marcus, I lost 50 pounds,
and you don't even care enough to notice.

01:23:45.463 --> 01:23:47.671
Yeah, I wear a medium now.

01:23:47.755 --> 01:23:49.421
The tricky part's keeping it off.

01:23:49.505 --> 01:23:50.755
I am aware of that, Ginger!

01:23:51.713 --> 01:23:53.171
I don't need her, guys.

01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:56.046
Just tell me that I'm better off
without her and I don't need her.

01:23:57.171 --> 01:23:59.421
I hate her lifestyle, and she hates mine.

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:01.005
Come on, Tony.

01:24:01.088 --> 01:24:03.963
Just tell me that me
and Sasha were a match made in hell

01:24:04.046 --> 01:24:05.255
and this is all for the best.

01:24:05.338 --> 01:24:06.921
I don't know what to say to you, Marcus.

01:24:07.546 --> 01:24:10.588
I'm literally telling you exactly
what to say, word for word.

01:24:10.921 --> 01:24:13.421
You messed up, man.

01:24:37.296 --> 01:24:38.671
Hi, leave me a message.

01:24:38.755 --> 01:24:41.463
I am so sorry.

01:24:41.546 --> 01:24:42.463
I messed up.

01:24:42.755 --> 01:24:44.380
I know this is too little too late,

01:24:44.463 --> 01:24:47.338
and you probably
never want to talk to me again, but...

01:24:47.421 --> 01:24:49.546
I don't know, I'm gonna keep trying.

01:24:49.630 --> 01:24:53.005
I can't let another 16 years go by
without talking to you.

01:24:54.546 --> 01:24:56.130
Hey, it's, um, me again.

01:24:56.213 --> 01:25:00.255
So, Southie's gave us another chance,
and we killed it.

01:25:00.338 --> 01:25:02.921
Oh, and, um, I don't know
if you got the link I texted you,

01:25:03.005 --> 01:25:06.421
but I took over merch from Quasar
and set up an online store,

01:25:06.505 --> 01:25:09.088
and, uh,
our sales have gone through the roof,

01:25:09.588 --> 01:25:12.296
which is, like, totally crazy.

01:25:12.505 --> 01:25:14.838
Okay, I know you're probably sick
of hearing from me,

01:25:14.921 --> 01:25:17.630
but I just wanted to let you know
that I moved out.

01:25:17.713 --> 01:25:18.713
Got my own place.

01:25:19.088 --> 01:25:21.588
It's small, but at least it's shitty.

01:25:21.671 --> 01:25:24.005
Uh, and I'm actually gonna be
near your restaurant tomorrow,

01:25:24.088 --> 01:25:27.630
so I figured I'd stop by and see
if maybe you're in San Francisco.

01:25:27.921 --> 01:25:30.963
I just...
I just really want to talk to you, so...

01:25:31.046 --> 01:25:34.505
...okay, uh, bye.

01:25:44.463 --> 01:25:45.630
Mom? Dad?

01:25:45.713 --> 01:25:47.546
- Surprise!
- We came to visit you.

01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:49.838
- In New York?
- Yeah!

01:25:49.921 --> 01:25:52.046
We have free airline vouchers,

01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:54.130
and we found your address on the Google.

01:25:54.588 --> 01:25:56.755

01:25:57.088 --> 01:25:58.630
but the other one is a baby.

01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:01.630
Sasha... goodness.

01:26:01.713 --> 01:26:04.213
Hey! Your apartment is beautiful.

01:26:04.296 --> 01:26:07.380
Seriously, you guys didn't have to fly
all the way out here.

01:26:07.713 --> 01:26:10.921
We heard Food & Wine magazine
is giving you a big award,

01:26:11.130 --> 01:26:13.671
- and we wanted to come support you.
- Wow.

01:26:13.921 --> 01:26:15.213
That's a first.

01:26:16.338 --> 01:26:17.421
Okay, um...

01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:20.130
we... we know you're mad at us
because we weren't around much

01:26:20.213 --> 01:26:21.088
- when--
- "Much"?

01:26:21.421 --> 01:26:24.588
You used to leave me home alone
for an entire day, Mom.

01:26:25.171 --> 01:26:27.505
We're trying our best
to make up for it now.

01:26:27.963 --> 01:26:29.546

We went to your new restaurant
in San Francisco,

01:26:40.713 --> 01:26:42.380
and we didn't tell them
we were your parents,

01:26:42.463 --> 01:26:44.713
and we pay everything in full price.

01:26:45.755 --> 01:26:46.671
No way.

01:26:47.296 --> 01:26:49.046

01:26:51.088 --> 01:26:52.338

I'm flying to New York
in the morning.

01:29:00.296 --> 01:29:02.671
My friend Keanu Reeves
recommended you guys.

01:29:02.755 --> 01:29:04.505
Have you heard of Keanu Reeves?
He's my friend.

01:29:04.588 --> 01:29:06.880
I punched him in the face.
I'll take that one.

01:29:07.338 --> 01:29:08.838
Uh, excellent choice, sir.

01:29:08.921 --> 01:29:10.255

- Oh, no, thank you.

01:29:10.338 --> 01:29:12.380
Of course, champagne! Pour that shit!

01:29:14.046 --> 01:29:15.213
All right. Thank you.

01:29:15.671 --> 01:29:17.505

01:29:36.213 --> 01:29:37.838
It comes with a belt

- Hey.

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:27.713
- Sasha!
- Sasha, who's your date tonight?

01:30:27.796 --> 01:30:30.463
Uh, well, I couldn't decide on just one,

01:30:30.546 --> 01:30:32.046
so I brought two.

01:30:32.921 --> 01:30:34.130
Quoc and Sandy Tran,

01:30:34.546 --> 01:30:35.630
- my parents.
- Aw!

01:30:36.005 --> 01:30:37.880
- Get them in the photo with ya.
- Come on.

01:30:37.963 --> 01:30:40.338
Mom, Dad, you're lookin' beautiful.

01:30:41.171 --> 01:30:43.838
Excuse me. Uh, I have a question!

01:30:46.630 --> 01:30:47.880
Marcus?

01:30:49.296 --> 01:30:50.296
What are you doing here?

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.213
I came here to find you.

01:30:53.046 --> 01:30:55.130
Uh, the whole plane ride over here,

01:30:55.255 --> 01:30:58.005
I was trying to figure out
how I could say this in some great way,

01:30:58.088 --> 01:31:00.171
but I couldn't,
so I'm just gonna say it badly.

01:31:01.838 --> 01:31:03.338
I wanna be where you are.

01:31:04.255 --> 01:31:09.255
I don't care where it is.
I don't care what outfit I have to wear.

01:31:09.338 --> 01:31:13.171
I don't care if I have to eat
a lot of tiny, little things that I hate.

01:31:13.255 --> 01:31:14.713
I-- I just wanna be with you.

01:31:15.255 --> 01:31:16.505
I wanna make you laugh.

01:31:16.755 --> 01:31:20.046
I want you to call me out
when I'm not pushing myself hard enough.

01:31:20.296 --> 01:31:22.213
I want to have a lot of sex with you.

01:31:23.255 --> 01:31:25.046
I probably should have left
the sex part out.

01:31:25.130 --> 01:31:27.588
I'm worried that I cheapened it.
Anyway, I just...

01:31:28.171 --> 01:31:32.046
I want to have a family with you.
I want to spend my life with you.

01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:33.713
Even if it scares me,

01:31:33.796 --> 01:31:36.630
even if I'm as scared every day
as I am right now.

01:31:37.588 --> 01:31:38.921
So my question is this:

01:31:40.046 --> 01:31:41.005
Sasha Tran...

01:31:42.046 --> 01:31:43.713
can I hold your purse for you?

01:31:48.463 --> 01:31:50.046
That was the bad version?

01:31:51.046 --> 01:31:52.713
- It was good?
- It was great.

01:31:52.796 --> 01:31:54.046
- You liked it?
- I loved it.

01:31:54.130 --> 01:31:55.171
Kiss already!

01:32:17.630 --> 01:32:19.005
Let's go get your award.

01:32:20.421 --> 01:32:23.213
- Look this way, please!
- Sasha, thank you!

01:32:23.588 --> 01:32:25.296
- This is fancy.
- Yeah, you like it?

01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:27.296
- Where is that from?
- Suits 'N Stuff.

01:32:27.463 --> 01:32:29.546
- Oh, my-- What is that?
- Came with two pairs of pants.

01:32:30.171 --> 01:32:31.296
I think they're paper.

01:32:33.546 --> 01:32:35.088
- Paid for it myself.
- What?

01:32:35.171 --> 01:32:37.421
- With the merch money.
- Oh!

01:32:37.505 --> 01:32:39.380
Oh, I cannot believe you did that.

01:32:39.463 --> 01:32:43.046
And we are honored to present
our Visionary of the Year award to...

01:32:43.671 --> 01:32:46.630
Sasha Tran!

01:32:46.713 --> 01:32:47.755
Sasha!

01:32:50.005 --> 01:32:51.213
Whoo!

01:32:58.005 --> 01:32:59.005
Sasha!

01:33:00.630 --> 01:33:02.130
What an amazing night.

01:33:02.921 --> 01:33:03.963
Are you still hungry?

01:33:04.046 --> 01:33:05.671
Starving.

01:33:05.755 --> 01:33:08.588
The main course was a rice noodle
wrapped around a fig.

01:33:08.671 --> 01:33:12.171
Well, lucky for you,

01:33:12.713 --> 01:33:14.005
I know a great new place.

01:33:14.338 --> 01:33:15.213
Really?

01:33:15.296 --> 01:33:17.130
Unlimited quail egg parfait.

01:33:17.213 --> 01:33:18.755
- Oh, great.
- Yeah.

01:33:18.963 --> 01:33:20.880
It's a buffet of parfait.

01:33:23.338 --> 01:33:26.171
We don't open for a week,
but we're deep in prep mode.

01:33:30.213 --> 01:33:31.380
I love it.

01:33:31.463 --> 01:33:33.421
It looks so different
from your other restaurant.

01:33:33.505 --> 01:33:35.338
Come here.
I wanna show you something.

01:33:37.963 --> 01:33:39.046
Hey, is it ready?

01:33:39.796 --> 01:33:40.755
Yes, Chef.

01:33:46.838 --> 01:33:48.046
It's just like my mom's.

01:33:57.921 --> 01:33:59.213
It's all her recipes.

01:34:00.921 --> 01:34:02.713
This is what I want to do, Marcus.

01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:06.296
The kind of food
that makes people feel at home.

01:34:07.755 --> 01:34:09.630
The way your mom always made me feel.

01:34:15.338 --> 01:34:16.213
You win.
