WEBVTT

00:17.720 --> 00:19.320
<i>Previously on Babylon Berlin.</i>

00:20.320 --> 00:21.560
<i>April 29.</i>

00:21.640 --> 00:25.360
<i>The cue "Prangertag" for a secret</i>
<i>operation is mentioned several times.</i>

00:25.440 --> 00:26.800
The train will be sent back.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.400
<i>Including the wagon with the gold.</i>

00:28.480 --> 00:30.320
<i>-There is no gold in the wagon.</i>
<i>-There is.</i>

00:30.400 --> 00:32.120
<i>The wagon numbers were swapped.</i>

00:32.480 --> 00:34.840
The gold is still in there.
They want to take it out

00:34.920 --> 00:37.360
<i>on the way to Russia,</i>
<i>before the border, with a robbery.</i>

00:37.440 --> 00:39.120
-By the Black Reichswehr.
-When?

00:39.640 --> 00:40.480
Tomorrow. Attention!

00:41.920 --> 00:46.640
Let's bring some original Prussian
spirit to this matter.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.200
The President of the Reich has ordered

00:48.280 --> 00:51.040
that the train be sent back
to the Soviet Union immediately.

00:51.560 --> 00:52.560
Without delay.

00:52.640 --> 00:54.000
<i>Without further investigation.</i>

00:58.200 --> 00:59.360
-Fritz!
-Gretchen.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.480
-Let me go.
-We were ratted out.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.680
-Freeze.
-Gretchen, run! Run!

01:05.920 --> 01:08.440
Fritz! No! They shot him!

01:09.120 --> 01:10.240
Your Benda here.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.520
The guys who shot down Fritz,
they were his men.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.280
Tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

03:01.600 --> 03:02.640
Do you have to go?

03:04.280 --> 03:05.120
Not yet.

03:11.640 --> 03:15.680
Our hotel affair is beginning to feel
as secret as it was at home.

03:17.560 --> 03:18.760
We have to get a flat.

03:23.560 --> 03:24.520
Is that the boy already?

03:24.800 --> 03:26.880
Impossible, he's taking the circle line.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.800
Charlotte!
Where did you come from all of a sudden?

03:43.880 --> 03:45.680
-Has the train left Berlin?
-What?

03:46.240 --> 03:47.920
It's going back to the Soviet Union.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.960
-Where have you been?
-When exactly is it going back?

03:54.120 --> 03:56.000
Wait downstairs. I'll be down in five.

04:00.480 --> 04:01.400
Who was that?

04:03.040 --> 04:03.880
A colleague.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.600
It's urgent.
I have to take care of it.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.240
Have the children packed yet?

04:24.040 --> 04:24.880
Greta?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.280
-Have the children packed yet?
-I packed.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.760
You're to speak when you are asked
and not interrupt Miss Greta.

04:33.280 --> 04:36.000
Jakob has packed
and I'll help Margot after lunch.

04:36.240 --> 04:37.360
That's how we'll do it.

04:44.800 --> 04:45.840
When is your train?

04:46.320 --> 04:48.440
In two hours, from Stettiner Station.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.280
I'll take you there
and go to the office afterwards.

04:52.640 --> 04:53.840
Why are you crying?

05:02.160 --> 05:03.240
I'll be right back.

05:09.800 --> 05:10.640
Greta? Come on.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.080
You're such a good girl.

05:28.920 --> 05:29.880
And pretty.

05:34.520 --> 05:35.440
There you go.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.120
We'll keep our chin up.

05:45.520 --> 05:48.600
-I'll go finish the packing.
-Good. You do that.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.080
Charlotte?
I've been looking for you everywhere.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.840
I read Jänicke's notes. You were right.
His target was Wolter.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.920
-Where have you been all this time?
-I'll tell you later.

06:01.440 --> 06:02.920
Come on, we have to go straight away. -But where?
-To see Benda.

06:05.680 --> 06:08.000
-On a Sunday?
-Yes. Get in.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.960
Wolter meets State Secretary Wendt
and Alfred Nyssen,

06:27.040 --> 06:30.280
accompanied by a woman whom Nyssen
introduces as the Countess Sorokina.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.960
-Svetlana Sorokina.
-Yes, exactly.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.520
Listen closely.
They are talking about robbing the train

06:36.600 --> 06:40.200
while it is being sent back to Russia,
and it says here where exactly. Here.

06:40.480 --> 06:41.920
Milestone 127.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.360
But why would Wolter
want 20 tons of poison gas?

06:44.440 --> 06:45.680
This is not about gas.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.600
It's about a hidden freight
in one of the wagons.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.240
The Sorokins' gold? How do you know about the gold?

06:57.440 --> 06:58.960
Sorokina talked about it.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.680
You met Svetlana Sorokina?

07:01.760 --> 07:02.880
Yes, but I...

07:03.520 --> 07:04.800
I didn't take it seriously.

07:05.640 --> 07:06.640
About the gold.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.120
Yes. Sorokina swapped the wagon numbers.

07:09.200 --> 07:13.400
AB 3221 was the wagon
which was opened in the engine shed,

07:13.480 --> 07:17.160
and TY 2305 is the wagon
which now contains the gold.

07:17.240 --> 07:20.280
And they'll all try to stop
the train before the border.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.680
Who do you mean, all?

07:23.160 --> 07:24.000
Well, Wolter.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.240
And Nyssen.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.240
-Shall I pack Marie's evening dress?
-You don't need to.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.520
We'll be in the garden the whole time.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.440
When Mama does her exercises,
with Dr. Hutten.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.560
Are you getting ill?

07:51.200 --> 07:53.600
With Mama alone it's so boring.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.360
I don't want to go without you.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Please, children.

08:00.320 --> 08:02.640
Why did you cry earlier?

08:03.600 --> 08:05.760
Because I was sad. Because...

08:07.120 --> 08:08.480
I won't see you for so long.

08:11.360 --> 08:14.080
Then little Marie will stay with you.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.120
Thank you.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.400
-Charlotte.
-Greta.

08:30.480 --> 08:31.440
What are you doing here?

08:31.960 --> 08:33.520
-This is Inspector...
-Gereon Rath.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.640
-Is the Councillor in?
-Come in.

08:41.560 --> 08:43.880
-What's the matter?
-I'm sorry, but it's very important.

08:45.240 --> 08:46.560
Come on in, I don't have much time.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.480
Miss Overbeck,
please offer the lady a drink, thank you.

08:52.840 --> 08:53.920
What would you like?

08:54.840 --> 08:56.800
-I can make some tea...
-Nothing, thanks.

08:58.760 --> 09:01.760
I need an experienced task force,
about 12 men.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.560
It's too late for that, Inspector.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.440
-But if we catch Wolter in the act...
-Do you really think

09:07.520 --> 09:10.600
we'll mess with anybody
because of that damned train again?

09:11.360 --> 09:13.560
Wolter is small fry.
We'll catch him sooner or later...

09:13.640 --> 09:14.960
He killed Stefan Jänicke.

09:17.000 --> 09:17.840
Can you prove that? Not yet.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.200
But we both know he did it.

09:25.520 --> 09:26.360
Lotte?

09:27.840 --> 09:30.120
Lotte? Can we meet?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.760
I need to talk to someone.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.120
Your guy?

09:36.920 --> 09:38.480
-No...
-Oh.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.080
Tell the bastard to go to hell.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.840
Greta, no guy in the world is worth it.

09:55.880 --> 09:58.560
I'm sure Mr. Gennat
will take all the necessary steps

09:58.640 --> 10:00.120
should your suspicion be confirmed.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.360
And please let that damned train go.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.960
Please excuse me now,
I have to take care of my family.

10:10.200 --> 10:15.240
With all respect, you can't be serious.
You put Jänicke on Wolter's tail.

10:15.320 --> 10:18.240
You put this boy at an extremely high risk
and now you don't even want to try...

10:18.320 --> 10:20.720
This is not your responsibility,
Inspector!

10:20.800 --> 10:23.360
This is possibly
about a whole wagon full of gold.

10:29.080 --> 10:33.120
We need to clean up this mess.
We gambled and lost.

10:34.200 --> 10:37.200
In a few weeks, none of us
will likely be sitting in our chairs.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.360
We'll deal with Wolter and his gang

10:40.440 --> 10:41.520
in due time.

10:42.560 --> 10:46.160
And if someone wants to steal precious
metals, it's none of our business.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.840
Councillor, I beg you.

10:48.560 --> 10:52.640
-With just a dozen men we could...
-You still don't get it.

10:53.240 --> 10:57.600
Today, State Secretary Wendt will release
the train on behalf of the President.

10:57.680 --> 11:00.200
At exactly 3 p.m.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.240
Please excuse me.

11:23.640 --> 11:24.480
What will we do now?

11:29.640 --> 11:32.400
Milestone 127. We need to find it.

11:43.040 --> 11:43.880
Here.

11:45.640 --> 11:48.200
We need to go... towards Wünsdorf.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.880
And then to that lake,
and all along the water.

11:51.320 --> 11:54.120
Milestone 127 must be around here.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.360
Alright.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.120
Let's go now. Very well.

12:29.960 --> 12:30.800
<i>Hello?</i>

12:31.960 --> 12:35.680
It's me. They're gone now. You can come.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.080
CONFISCATED!
KEEP DISTANCE!

12:42.760 --> 12:44.080
-Is everything ready?
-Yes.

13:15.880 --> 13:19.320
Listen, Henning.
Take the fastest car you can get

13:19.400 --> 13:21.720
and take the same route. Milestone 127.

13:22.640 --> 13:26.400
Full gear, yes. Security level four.
With all the frills.

13:27.320 --> 13:30.160
Yes, dammit, gas masks, too. Hurry up.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.320
They're on their way.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.840
Good. So, where?

14:34.120 --> 14:36.960
-The study. Where is the study?
-This way.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.640
There.

15:56.640 --> 15:57.680
Here, hold this.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.040
-Otto, I don't know...
-It's too late for that now.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.400
-This won't get Fritz back to life.
-Be quiet and hold this.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.240
-I'm scared.
-Careful now.

16:14.920 --> 16:15.760
Otto.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.960
The other way round. Right.

16:37.920 --> 16:40.600
Check my jacket, right-hand side pocket.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.080
Who signed this?

16:52.160 --> 16:54.720
URGENTLY WANTED FOR INCITEMENT
OF THE PEOPLE AND DEFAMATION

16:54.800 --> 16:56.720
-Benda.
-Well then.

16:58.640 --> 17:00.800
This here is the ignition mechanism.

17:01.600 --> 17:02.840
You'll prime it later.

17:04.440 --> 17:09.160
Here, you'll twist these wires together
and put them back in the hole.

17:09.320 --> 17:12.800
But only shortly before the old guy
comes back, yeah? Don't wait too long.

17:20.520 --> 17:23.360
When he opens the drawer,
the bomb will explode.

17:23.680 --> 17:27.040
-You have to be gone then. Got it?
-Yes.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.360
You better disappear altogether.

17:41.800 --> 17:42.840
Get out of the city.

17:47.560 --> 17:48.520
Here.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.400
We're doing this for Fritz.

18:02.320 --> 18:03.600
Can I call you?

18:05.240 --> 18:06.400
We'll call you.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.320
<i>-Operator.</i>
-Please give me police headquarters.

18:39.680 --> 18:40.800
<i>One moment, please.</i>

18:45.480 --> 18:47.400
<i>Police headquarters, how may I help you?</i>

18:48.640 --> 18:54.160
Excuse me, I'm trying to reach
a female inspector, assistant Ritter.

18:54.240 --> 18:58.080
<i>-Which department?</i>
-Homicide department. Homicide squad.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.720
<i>-Department A, homicid</i>e.
-Yes.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.360
<i>-One moment, please.</i>
-I'll hold.

19:10.880 --> 19:13.960
<i>There is no deputy inspector</i>
<i>of that name here.</i>

19:15.360 --> 19:17.280
-Are you sure?
<i>-Yes.</i>

19:19.360 --> 19:21.200
<i>I can't help you.</i> OK. Thank you.

19:40.840 --> 19:41.680
Charlotte.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.360
Where have you been?

19:52.280 --> 19:56.920
If there is a time where you have
to tell me everything, it is now.

19:59.000 --> 19:59.840
What does he want? Gereon!

22:01.960 --> 22:05.040
Gereon, wake up! Wake up!

22:06.240 --> 22:07.200
Wake up!

22:08.080 --> 22:08.920
Wake up!

22:10.760 --> 22:12.360
I'm stuck.

26:51.560 --> 26:52.680
IN ETERNAL MEMORY OF OUR
WORLD WAR VICTIMS

26:52.760 --> 26:55.200
The brave men we've come here
to honor today...

26:56.680 --> 26:58.600
were ready to give something...

26:59.720 --> 27:01.600
no one can ever give them back.

27:02.640 --> 27:03.480
Their youth...

27:04.920 --> 27:06.040
their future...

27:08.160 --> 27:09.000
their lives.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.120
They gave it to us.

27:15.440 --> 27:17.000
To our German Fatherland.

27:19.240 --> 27:20.840
-Who is that man?
-Pardon?

27:23.680 --> 27:24.640
From the trust.

27:25.120 --> 27:27.720
They supported us
when Dad didn't come home.

27:28.120 --> 27:30.000
They want to pay for your studies.

27:30.360 --> 27:31.680
I don't want to study.

27:32.120 --> 27:33.160
I thank you.

27:33.800 --> 27:37.200
I would now like to ask
Mrs. Helga Rath from Cologne,

27:37.560 --> 27:41.240
the widow of infantry lieutenant
Anno Rath, to come forward.

27:42.200 --> 27:43.280
Leave me out this time, OK?

28:05.520 --> 28:07.960
I thank the Annemarie Nyssen Trust
for this invitation.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.840
Thank you for the opportunity
to speak here.

28:16.480 --> 28:18.960
I came to Berlin with my son, Moritz.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.200
Moritz who never got to meet his father.

28:25.280 --> 28:28.720
When I learned of the loss of my husband,
Moritz hadn't been born yet.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.440
My husband was deemed missing
at the time when...

28:32.960 --> 28:38.080
...when our early happiness as a twosome
was supposed to become "us". Us three.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.040
Loss, loneliness...

28:47.440 --> 28:48.440
gloom. Excuse me.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.160
I always say that I'm grateful. But today I see for the first time...

29:13.040 --> 29:15.560
a member of the Nyssen family in person.

29:19.480 --> 29:23.640
Your company, Nyssen AG, is the biggest
arms manufacturer of the German Reich.

29:28.440 --> 29:33.400
Someone who is responsible for producing
the weapons used to kill our husbands...

29:35.600 --> 29:39.480
can't then give us any solace
for the losses we have sustained.

29:48.760 --> 29:51.760
Mr. Nyssen, you and your family,
I'm grateful for your help.

29:54.120 --> 29:55.720
But I also despise what you do.

30:06.160 --> 30:07.080
I'm sorry.

30:08.680 --> 30:09.640
Excuse me.

30:11.600 --> 30:12.440
Mrs. Rath.

30:14.760 --> 30:18.440
How about I invite you for lunch
afterwards and we talk in peace?

33:08.040 --> 33:09.480
Good evening, Miss Overbeck.

33:10.480 --> 33:11.480
Going out?

33:12.200 --> 33:14.560
I wanted to go get some beer...

33:15.080 --> 33:16.480
before you come back.

33:16.920 --> 33:19.720
-Is there no beer left in the basement?
-There is.

33:20.440 --> 33:23.280
Yes, there is.
I thought it wasn't cold enough.

33:24.040 --> 33:25.360
You're all confused.

33:27.160 --> 33:29.440
Don't worry,
we'll do it differently tonight.

33:29.720 --> 33:34.560
I'll take care of the drinks,
you prepare dinner and keep me company.

34:29.560 --> 34:31.240
Are you ready, Miss Overbeck?

35:10.160 --> 35:11.640
A '15 Petrus.

35:13.080 --> 35:14.440
You've never had anything like it.

35:17.360 --> 35:20.400
...we investigate the suppliers
of the city hospital.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.640
Sold off to those Sklarek Brothers
four years ago,

35:24.720 --> 35:26.800
approved by Lord Mayor Böß.

35:27.800 --> 35:30.280
So far, so good. But...

35:31.920 --> 35:35.600
a company which deals
with hospital textiles

35:35.680 --> 35:38.320
can hardly invoice for fur coats, right?

35:38.800 --> 35:41.400
Who needs mink coats in hospital?

35:42.240 --> 35:43.400
Or at the police station?

35:46.080 --> 35:51.000
Miss Overbeck, I paid one sixth
of my monthly salary for this wine.

35:52.600 --> 35:56.760
And then there's
the wife of the Lord Mayor.

35:57.920 --> 35:58.880
Anna Böß.

36:03.280 --> 36:05.000
You must be suffering terribly.

36:07.760 --> 36:08.920
That guy should be ashamed.

36:09.760 --> 36:11.400
Such a lovely girl like you.

36:45.040 --> 36:46.840
Will you still need me, Councillor?

36:47.760 --> 36:48.600
No.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.120
Oh, Greta?

36:52.160 --> 36:53.240
Councillor?

36:54.400 --> 36:56.120
Give me the lad's name,

36:56.200 --> 36:59.480
I'll have him arrested
and thrown in jail for meanness.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.080
Get out of the car, we're home.

37:47.520 --> 37:48.640
Greta?

37:49.760 --> 37:51.160
What a surprise!

37:54.920 --> 37:57.520
-Did something happen?
-Jakob has a temperature.

37:58.080 --> 37:59.160
Where is the girl?

38:00.000 --> 38:01.360
I gave her the evening off.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Heartache.

38:03.680 --> 38:05.440
When it rains, it pours.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.280
I'll take the children to bed.

38:18.200 --> 38:21.280
Mum will make some tea for you,
so you'll sleep well.

38:21.760 --> 38:24.040
No, Mum, I'll go straight to bed.

38:41.320 --> 38:44.160
-A ticket to Usedom Island, please.
-Return?

38:44.360 --> 38:46.080
-Single.
-Eight fifty.

38:46.160 --> 38:47.600
It's this platform here.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.160
That's the one.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.800
Bribery! <i>Extrablatt!</i>

38:52.880 --> 38:55.080
-Sorry, I was too hasty.
-Mayor's wife gets mink coat

38:55.160 --> 38:56.080
paid for by the city!

38:56.440 --> 39:00.560
<i>Extrablatt! </i>Bribery in hospital supplies.

39:00.640 --> 39:04.280
Sklarek Brothers are suspects. <i>Extrablatt!</i>

39:04.360 --> 39:06.280
Bribery! Scandal!

39:14.840 --> 39:16.880
Böß, you pig, your wife's got what?

39:16.960 --> 39:18.880
Fur and mink on her Jewish bod!

39:18.960 --> 39:20.720
Böß, you pig, your wife's got what?

39:21.440 --> 39:23.480
Of course I'll go out there.

39:25.480 --> 39:26.600
Jewish sow!

39:26.680 --> 39:28.960
Böß, you pig, your wife's got what?

39:38.080 --> 39:39.000
Daddy?

39:40.760 --> 39:43.600
Can I be with you, Daddy? I can't sleep.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.520
Where is your mum?

39:46.240 --> 39:47.400
She's with Jakob.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.040
Come here, then.

39:55.880 --> 39:57.600
Do you want to help me work?

39:59.200 --> 40:00.280
Look here, then.

40:01.960 --> 40:05.120
So, please sign...

40:05.840 --> 40:06.680
here.

40:09.960 --> 40:14.040
Gentlemen! Please be reasonable.

40:14.120 --> 40:17.520
I... I give you my word.

40:24.440 --> 40:27.160
This is no way to talk to each other.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.840
This is no way to solve problems.

40:31.920 --> 40:35.920
This is... This is no way
to deal with one another.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.600
I will have this station cleared!

40:48.320 --> 40:50.800
How dare you talk to me like this!

40:50.920 --> 40:53.040
-I won't stand for this!

41:31.880 --> 41:32.680
Fritz!

41:33.800 --> 41:34.640
What?

41:37.200 --> 41:39.720
What are you doing here? Fritz...

41:41.160 --> 41:44.040
-Fritz, what are you doing here?
-You're mistaking me for someone else.

41:45.360 --> 41:47.400
Tell me, what are you doing here, Fritz?

41:47.480 --> 41:48.920
You're mistaken.

41:49.520 --> 41:52.760
Fritz, what are you doing here?

42:02.600 --> 42:04.960
Police, let's go! Quickly!

42:07.520 --> 42:08.960
Back up! Get back!

42:38.600 --> 42:41.120
STETTINER STATION

43:00.960 --> 43:01.800
Right.

43:03.720 --> 43:07.160
My darling, we've done enough work.
Now it's time to go to bed.

43:08.520 --> 43:09.480
Daddy?

43:11.640 --> 43:12.880
What's this?

43:18.760 --> 43:20.120
What, my little angel?

43:47.560 --> 43:48.760
August?
