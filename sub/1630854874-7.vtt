John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:33.299 --> 00:34.501
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:34.501 --> 00:36.569
I'M JOHN OLIVER, THANKS SO MUCH

00:36.569 --> 00:37.270
FOR JOINING US.

00:37.270 --> 00:39.205
IT HAS BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.907
A TEXAS JUDGE MOVED TO SUSPEND

00:40.907 --> 00:42.475
FDA APPROVAL OF A KEY DRUG FOR

00:42.475 --> 00:44.911
MEDICATION ABORTIONS, A RICH

00:44.911 --> 00:45.812
WHITE MAN SUFFERED THE BEGINNING

00:45.812 --> 00:47.714
OF A POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCE, AND

00:47.714 --> 00:50.183
WWE SOLD A CONTROLLING STAKE IN

00:50.183 --> 00:52.252
ITSELF, A DECISION VINCE McMAHON

00:52.252 --> 00:53.686
WENT ON CNBC TO EXPLAIN.

00:53.686 --> 00:55.088
YOU ARE THE WWE, AND THE WWE

00:55.088 --> 00:56.489
IS YOU.

00:56.489 --> 00:58.425
SO WHY?

00:58.425 --> 01:00.927
IT'S THE RIGHT TIME.

01:00.927 --> 01:02.328
IT'S THE RIGHT TIME TO DO THE

01:02.328 --> 01:03.396
RIGHT THING.

01:03.396 --> 01:08.101
John: OKAY, I'M SO GLAD HE'S

01:08.101 --> 01:09.936
THAT SAYING NOTHING THERE,

01:09.936 --> 01:11.471
BECAUSE I AM EXCLUSIVELY

01:11.471 --> 01:12.105
INTERESTED IN WHAT IS HAPPENING

01:12.105 --> 01:12.405
ON HIS FACE.

01:12.405 --> 01:12.972
IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN VINCE

01:12.972 --> 01:13.706
McMAHON BEFORE, DON'T WORRY, YOU

01:13.706 --> 01:15.208
STILL HAVEN'T.

01:15.208 --> 01:16.109
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HE'S LOOKED

01:16.109 --> 01:17.510
LIKE FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS OR

01:17.510 --> 01:19.212
SO, WHEREAS THIS IS CLEARLY AN

01:19.212 --> 01:20.480
AI-GENERATED RESPONSE TO THE

01:20.480 --> 01:23.116
PROMPT "SNAKE TYCOON."

01:23.116 --> 01:24.451
LOOK, SADLY, I CAN'T DEVOTE THE

01:24.451 --> 01:26.252
REST OF THE SHOW TO TALKING

01:26.252 --> 01:27.187
ABOUT THE DECISIONS ON DISPLAY

01:27.187 --> 01:28.721
HERE, SO I'LL JUST DEVOTE 30

01:28.721 --> 01:29.789
MORE SECONDS TO IT.

01:29.789 --> 01:31.057
HE LOOKS LIKE THE ANSWER TO THE

01:31.057 --> 01:32.192
QUESTION "WHAT IF SALVADOR DALI

01:32.192 --> 01:33.526
CHOSE TO LIVE WITHOUT

01:33.526 --> 01:34.961
IMAGINATION?"

01:34.961 --> 01:36.095
HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S ABOUT TO

01:36.095 --> 01:37.030
CHALLENGE SOMEONE TO A BALLOON

01:37.030 --> 01:39.065
RACE AROUND THE WORLD.

01:39.065 --> 01:40.133
HE LOOKS LIKE VINCENT PRICE

01:40.133 --> 01:41.468
HAVING AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO

01:41.468 --> 01:42.635
BEING STUNG BY BEES.

01:42.635 --> 01:43.636
HE LOOKS LIKE A CIRCUS OWNER

01:43.636 --> 01:45.171
FROM THE 1930S WHO HARASSES THE

01:45.171 --> 01:46.506
DANCERS, MISTREATS THE ANIMALS

01:46.506 --> 01:48.241
FOR FUN, AND IS EVENTUALLY

01:48.241 --> 01:49.342
MURDERED BY A LION WHILE THE

01:49.342 --> 01:50.710
WHOLE TOWN CHEERS.

01:50.710 --> 01:53.446
AND SADLY, THAT'S MY TIME.

01:53.446 --> 01:54.981
AND THE REASON WE CAN'T TALK

01:54.981 --> 01:56.716
MORE ABOUT THIS MAN'S FACE IS

01:56.716 --> 01:57.784
THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS THE

01:57.784 --> 01:58.685
EVENTS IN TENNESSEE.

01:58.685 --> 02:00.420
AFTER LAST WEEK'S MASS SHOOTING

02:00.420 --> 02:02.255
AT COVENANT SCHOOL, YOUNG

02:02.255 --> 02:03.923
ACTIVISTS HAVE BEEN AT THE STATE

02:03.923 --> 02:05.091
CAPITOL PROTESTING THE LACK OF

02:05.091 --> 02:06.292
RESPONSE FROM THE LEGISLATURE,

02:06.292 --> 02:07.894
WHILE ENGAGING IN SOME CATCHY

02:07.894 --> 02:08.862
CHANTS CONCERNING GOVERNOR

02:08.862 --> 02:10.163
BILL LEE.

02:10.163 --> 02:15.835
FUCK BILL LEE!

02:15.835 --> 02:18.171
John: LOOK, YOU CAN TRY AND

02:18.171 --> 02:19.472
GET CLEVER WITH IT, BUT AT THE

02:19.472 --> 02:21.374
END OF THE DAY, THERE'S NOTHING

02:21.374 --> 02:22.375
LIKE A CHANT THAT GOES "FUCK,"

02:22.375 --> 02:25.712
AND THEN THE NAME OF THE PERSON

02:25.712 --> 02:26.212
THAT YOU'RE MAD AT.

02:26.212 --> 02:27.780
IT'S SHORT, IT'S SWEET, IT'S TO

02:27.780 --> 02:29.516
THE POINT, IT'S FUCK BILL LEE.

02:29.516 --> 02:31.017
AND THAT ANGER IS TOTALLY

02:31.017 --> 02:32.218
JUSTIFIED, AS THE RESPONSE FROM

02:32.218 --> 02:33.286
LEE AND HIS FELLOW REPUBLICANS

02:33.286 --> 02:34.954
HAS BEEN DEEPLY UNDERWHELMING.

02:34.954 --> 02:37.090
HERE'S ONE REPRESENTATIVE

02:37.090 --> 02:38.291
ARGUING TO YOUNG PEOPLE'S FACES

02:38.291 --> 02:39.826
THAT IT WOULD BE POINTLESS TO

02:39.826 --> 02:41.528
BAN AR-15'S.

02:41.528 --> 02:42.729
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE MY

02:42.729 --> 02:43.763
ANSWER, AND LOOK, I'M GONNA SAY

02:43.763 --> 02:44.697
THAT STRAIGHT UP.

02:44.697 --> 02:47.033
IT'S NOT ABOUT THIS ONE GUN.

02:47.033 --> 02:48.601
IF THERE IS A FIREARM OUT THERE

02:48.601 --> 02:50.103
THAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE BEING

02:50.103 --> 02:52.171
SHOT WITH, PLEASE SHOW ME WHICH

02:52.171 --> 02:52.672
ONE IT IS.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.674
John: I MEAN, THAT IS A

02:54.674 --> 02:56.142
HALL-OF-FAME SHITTY RESPONSE

02:56.142 --> 02:56.976
BUT, ALSO, IF YOUR OPENER IS

02:56.976 --> 02:58.211
"YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE MY

02:58.211 --> 03:00.213
ANSWER," MAYBE START THINKING OF

03:00.213 --> 03:01.481
SOME BETTER ONES.

03:01.481 --> 03:02.582
AND, FOR THE RECORD, I DON'T

03:02.582 --> 03:04.117
WANT TO BE SHOT BY ANY GUNS.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.852
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GET SHOT BY

03:05.852 --> 03:06.619
A NERF GUN.

03:06.619 --> 03:08.254
AND NOT BECAUSE THEY STING MY

03:08.254 --> 03:09.389
PAPER BONES, WHICH THEY DO, BUT

03:09.389 --> 03:11.424
JUST BASED ON THE FACT THAT THIS

03:11.424 --> 03:13.860
IS MURPH, NERF'S ACTUAL MASCOT.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.895
AND I'M PRETTY SURE EVERY NERF

03:15.895 --> 03:17.096
DART IS ONE OF THE MANY PENISES

03:17.096 --> 03:19.899
THAT MAKE UP MURPH'S NUDE BODY.

03:19.899 --> 03:21.134
SOME PROTESTORS ACTUALLY MADE

03:21.134 --> 03:23.002
THEIR WAY INTO THE HOUSE GALLERY

03:23.002 --> 03:24.337
LAST WEEK, AND THREE STATE

03:24.337 --> 03:25.538
REPRESENTATIVES TOOK TO THE

03:25.538 --> 03:26.539
FLOOR TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT FOR

03:26.539 --> 03:27.106
THEM.

03:27.106 --> 03:28.541
THAT, IN TURN, LED TO

03:28.541 --> 03:29.776
REPUBLICANS INTRODUCING

03:29.776 --> 03:32.045
RESOLUTIONS TO EXPEL THE

03:32.045 --> 03:33.112
LAWMAKERS, WHICH THE HOUSE

03:33.112 --> 03:35.114
SPEAKER SUPPORTED AFTER CLAIMING

03:35.114 --> 03:37.150
THEY WERE "INCITING VIOLENCE."

03:37.150 --> 03:39.185
ALTHOUGH WHEN PRESSED FOR PROOF,

03:39.185 --> 03:40.486
HE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO OFFER.

03:40.486 --> 03:41.854
THERE'S NO DOUBT THEY WERE

03:41.854 --> 03:43.022
DISRUPTIVE, BUT WHAT'S THE

03:43.022 --> 03:44.057
EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE TRYING

03:44.057 --> 03:45.558
TO INCITE VIOLENCE?

03:45.558 --> 03:46.626
WELL THEY WERE TRYING TO JAZZ

03:46.626 --> 03:47.660
PEOPLE UP, WHEN WE HAVE

03:47.660 --> 03:48.628
REPRESENTATIVES--

03:48.628 --> 03:49.862
BUT INCITE VIOLENCE.

03:49.862 --> 03:50.897
WELL, WHEN WE HAD

03:50.897 --> 03:52.098
REPRESENTATIVES TRYING TO GO TO

03:52.098 --> 03:53.299
THE RESTROOM, THEY GOT SPIT ON.

03:53.299 --> 03:55.234
DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT

03:55.234 --> 03:56.502
THESE THREE MEMBERS WERE

03:56.502 --> 03:58.538
ENCOURAGING PROTESTERS TO SPIT

03:58.538 --> 03:59.806
ON MEMBERS OR TROOPERS?

03:59.806 --> 04:02.041
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT.

04:02.041 --> 04:03.142
John: OH, OKAY, SO YOU CAN'T

04:03.142 --> 04:05.311
PROVE THEY WERE INCITING

04:05.311 --> 04:06.145
VIOLENCE, BUT IN THE INTEREST OF

04:06.145 --> 04:06.946
SAFETY, YOU FEEL YOU HAVE A

04:06.946 --> 04:08.047
RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE THEIR

04:08.047 --> 04:09.949
DANGEROUS PLATFORM AWAY FROM

04:09.949 --> 04:10.383
THEM.

04:10.383 --> 04:12.185
BUT IF INSTEAD OF MEGAPHONES,

04:12.185 --> 04:13.186
THEY HAD, SAY, SOMETHING THAT

04:13.186 --> 04:14.487
CAN FIRE A HUNDRED ROUNDS IN A

04:14.487 --> 04:15.722
MATTER OF MINUTES, THEN, SADLY,

04:15.722 --> 04:17.056
IT'S LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO

04:17.056 --> 04:17.890
ANYTHING TO PREVENT THAT,

04:17.890 --> 04:20.159
BECAUSE WE ASKED THE PREMATURELY

04:20.159 --> 04:21.694
EMBALMED MAYOR OF WHOVILLE AND

04:21.694 --> 04:23.129
HE SAID "NO."

04:23.129 --> 04:25.031
ALSO, TO THE EXTENT THIS IS

04:25.031 --> 04:26.499
ABOUT "DECORUM," IT'S WORTH

04:26.499 --> 04:27.500
KNOWING THIS LEGISLATURE HAS

04:27.500 --> 04:28.935
APPARENTLY SEEN FAR WORSE

04:28.935 --> 04:29.736
BEHAVIOR.

04:29.736 --> 04:31.337
AS GLORIA JOHNSON, ONE OF THE

04:31.337 --> 04:32.271
LAWMAKERS THREATENED WITH

04:32.271 --> 04:34.040
EXPULSION, POINTED OUT, "WE HAD

04:34.040 --> 04:35.241
A CHILD MOLESTER ON THE FLOOR

04:35.241 --> 04:37.143
FOR YEARS, THEY HELPED HIM GET

04:37.143 --> 04:37.710
REELECTED AND DID NOTHING TO

04:37.710 --> 04:39.012
EXPEL HIM.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.813
WE'VE HAD MEMBERS PEE IN EACH

04:40.813 --> 04:42.248
OTHERS CHAIRS, WE'VE HAD MEMBERS

04:42.248 --> 04:43.716
PRESCRIBE DRUGS TO THEIR

04:43.716 --> 04:44.851
COUSIN-MISTRESS, AND NOTHING

04:44.851 --> 04:47.220
HAPPENED.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.422
AND, SORRY, "COUSIN-MISTRESS?"

04:49.422 --> 04:50.323
DO YOU KNOW HOW CRAZY A LIST OF

04:50.323 --> 04:51.758
ALLEGATIONS HAS TO BE FOR

04:51.758 --> 04:53.126
SOMEONE TO GO, "THERE WAS THAT

04:53.126 --> 04:54.360
CHILD MOLESTER FOR YEARS, BUT

04:54.360 --> 04:55.061
HONESTLY DON'T EVEN BOTHER

04:55.061 --> 04:55.895
WRITING THAT DOWN BECAUSE WAIT

04:55.895 --> 04:57.397
UNTIL YOU HEAR ABOUT THE NEXT

04:57.397 --> 04:58.131
COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I'M ABOUT

04:58.131 --> 04:59.766
TO SAY."

04:59.766 --> 05:01.668
THE HOUSE VOTED ON WHETHER TO

05:01.668 --> 05:02.235
EXPEL THE THREE MEMBERS ON

05:02.235 --> 05:03.636
THURSDAY, AND THERE WAS A

05:03.636 --> 05:04.704
PATTERN TO THE RESULTS THAT WAS

05:04.704 --> 05:06.539
PRETTY HARD TO MISS.

05:06.539 --> 05:08.675
THE GOP-CONTROLLED HOUSE

05:08.675 --> 05:10.977
VOTING THURSDAY TO OUST STATE

05:10.977 --> 05:12.211
REPRESENTATIVES JUSTIN JONES AND

05:12.211 --> 05:13.246
JUSTIN PEARSON.

05:13.246 --> 05:14.480
WHILE A MOTION TO EXPEL

05:14.480 --> 05:15.715
REPRESENTATIVE GLORIA JOHNSON

05:15.715 --> 05:17.550
NARROWLY FAILED BY JUST ONE

05:17.550 --> 05:19.352
VOTE.

05:19.352 --> 05:21.087
WHEN ASKED WHY SHE WAS SPARED,

05:21.087 --> 05:22.755
JOHNSON SAYING THIS.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.090
IT MIGHT HAVE TO DO WITH THE

05:24.090 --> 05:25.324
COLOR OF OUR SKIN.

05:25.324 --> 05:26.726
BUT STATE HOUSE REPUBLICANS

05:26.726 --> 05:27.927
DENYING THAT CLAIM.

05:27.927 --> 05:29.662
OUR MEMBERS LITERALLY DIDN'T

05:29.662 --> 05:31.898
LOOK AT THE ETHNICITY OF THE

05:31.898 --> 05:32.732
MEMBERS THAT WERE UP FOR

05:32.732 --> 05:33.900
EXPULSION.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.102
John: OKAY NOW, LEGALLY, I

05:36.102 --> 05:37.704
CAN'T SAY THAT GUY IS LYING,

05:37.704 --> 05:38.538
WHICH IS WHY IT'S GOING TO BE AN

05:38.538 --> 05:39.639
INTERESTING DAY FOR OUR LAWYERS

05:39.639 --> 05:40.773
TOMORROW WHEN THEY FIND OUT THAT

05:40.773 --> 05:42.375
I SAID THAT GUY IS DEFINITELY

05:42.375 --> 05:47.880
LYING.

05:47.880 --> 05:48.448
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

05:48.448 --> 05:49.015
"WE LITERALLY DON'T EVEN SEE

05:49.015 --> 05:49.882
COLOR" IS THE UNIVERSAL TELL FOR

05:49.882 --> 05:50.717
PEOPLE WHO SPEND ALL DAY

05:50.717 --> 05:51.317
THINKING ABOUT HOW THEY'D LIKE

05:51.317 --> 05:53.119
TO SEE LESS COLOR.

05:53.119 --> 05:54.187
NOW, FORTUNATELY, PEARSON AND

05:54.187 --> 05:55.621
JONES COULD BE RE-APPOINTED

05:55.621 --> 05:56.622
FAIRLY SOON, OR RE-ELECTED DOWN

05:56.622 --> 05:57.290
THE ROAD.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.324
AND WHILE REPUBLICANS CLAIMED--

05:58.324 --> 06:00.226
GALLINGLY-- THAT THIS WAS TO

06:00.226 --> 06:01.861
TEACH THEM A LESSON ABOUT

06:01.861 --> 06:04.030
GRANDSTANDING, PEARSON WANTED TO

06:04.030 --> 06:05.698
MAKE IT CLEAR EXACTLY WHY THIS

06:05.698 --> 06:07.600
ESCALATED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.801
I DON'T PERSONALLY WANT

06:08.801 --> 06:10.536
ATTENTION.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.371
WHAT I WANT IS ATTENTION ON THE

06:12.371 --> 06:13.806
ISSUE OF GUN VIOLENCE.

06:13.806 --> 06:16.743
BUT INSTEAD, WE'RE HERE WITH THE

06:16.743 --> 06:17.877
RESOLUTION YOU PUT UP, TALKING

06:17.877 --> 06:19.345
ABOUT EXPELLING ME FOR

06:19.345 --> 06:20.947
ADVOCATING FOR ENDING GUN

06:20.947 --> 06:22.148
VIOLENCE IN THE STATE OF

06:22.148 --> 06:23.382
TENNESSEE.

06:23.382 --> 06:24.917
John: EXACTLY.

06:24.917 --> 06:25.718
AND IT'S NOT A GREAT SIGN FOR

06:25.718 --> 06:26.886
TENNESSEE WHEN THEY PUNISH THE

06:26.886 --> 06:28.488
ONES SPEAKING OUT AGAINST GUN

06:28.488 --> 06:30.056
VIOLENCE, WHILE KEEPING THE ONES

06:30.056 --> 06:31.991
WHO ASK "WHICH GUN WOULD YOU BE

06:31.991 --> 06:33.459
COMFORTABLE BEING SHOT WITH?"

06:33.459 --> 06:35.895
LOOK, THERE ARE PRETTY CLEARLY

06:35.895 --> 06:36.863
TWO BIG ISSUES GOING ON HERE:

06:36.863 --> 06:38.464
RACISM AND GUN VIOLENCE--

06:38.464 --> 06:39.632
WHICH, INCIDENTALLY, WILL IN ALL

06:39.632 --> 06:40.967
LIKELIHOOD BE THE NAME OF THE

06:40.967 --> 06:43.536
NEXT KID ROCK ALBUM.

06:43.536 --> 06:44.937
AND TENNESSEE LAWMAKERS CAN

06:44.937 --> 06:46.172
CONTINUE TO BRUSH BOTH OF THOSE

06:46.172 --> 06:47.540
ISSUES ASIDE, SAYING "GUNS

06:47.540 --> 06:48.174
AREN'T THE PROBLEM" OR "WE DON'T

06:48.174 --> 06:49.742
SEE COLOR."

06:49.742 --> 06:50.877
BUT THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF

06:50.877 --> 06:52.078
TENNESSEE ARE MAKING IT VERY

06:52.078 --> 06:53.713
CLEAR THEY'RE SICK OF WAITING,

06:53.713 --> 06:55.982
AND THAT CHANGE IS LONG OVERDUE.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.583
OR IF I MAY PUT THAT IN THE

06:57.583 --> 06:59.485
WORDS OF THIS SEGA GENESIS VIDEO

06:59.485 --> 07:01.053
GAME VILLAIN.

07:01.053 --> 07:02.922
IT'S THE RIGHT TIME TO DO THE

07:02.922 --> 07:03.356
RIGHT THING.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.390
John: THANK YOU, FRENCH

07:04.390 --> 07:05.758
DRACULA, I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT

07:05.758 --> 07:07.260
BETTER MYSELF.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.661
AND NOW THIS.

07:08.661 --> 07:10.329
Announcer: AND NOW, IT'S

07:10.329 --> 07:12.532
EASTER, THE MOST TERRIFYING TIME

07:12.532 --> 07:15.268
OF THE YEAR.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.035
IT'S ALMOST TIME TO MEET THE

07:16.035 --> 07:16.469
EASTER BUNNY.

07:16.469 --> 07:18.237
ARE YOU READY?

07:18.237 --> 07:20.006
SOMETIMES, THE EASTER BUNNY'S

07:20.006 --> 07:21.007
A LITTLE SCARY ANIMAL.

07:21.007 --> 07:21.641
I SAW ONE AT THE MALL THE OTHER

07:21.641 --> 07:24.577
DAY.

07:24.577 --> 07:26.145
I WAS LIKE, I'M NOT DOING THAT.

07:26.145 --> 07:27.013
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE EASTER

07:27.013 --> 07:30.049
BUNNY WAS CREEPY.

07:30.049 --> 07:30.917
YEAH, I AGREE.

07:30.917 --> 07:35.288
SANTA I CAN DEAL WITH.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.856
I HAVE YET TO SEE A REALLY

07:36.856 --> 07:38.257
CUTE EASTER BUNNY, NOT A CUTE

07:38.257 --> 07:38.691
EASTER BUNNY THERE.

07:38.691 --> 07:39.058
A KIND OF SCARY.

07:39.058 --> 07:39.559
A CREEPY EFFECT.

07:39.559 --> 07:40.026
I WAS SCARED OF THE

07:40.026 --> 07:40.493
EASTER BUNNY AS A KID.

07:40.493 --> 07:41.060
IF THE EYES ARE DEAD UP

07:41.060 --> 07:42.461
THERE, NO THANK YOU.

07:42.461 --> 07:42.995
TALKING ABOUT A 6-FOOT

07:42.995 --> 07:49.936
TALL--

07:49.936 --> 07:51.838
I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY, THE

07:51.838 --> 07:52.405
VISUAL OF THE BUNNY.

07:52.405 --> 07:53.039
GIGANTIC BUNNY, DOES ANYBODY

07:53.039 --> 07:53.306
LIKE THAT?

07:53.306 --> 07:53.773
CUTE BUNNY.

07:53.773 --> 07:54.106
CUTE BUNNY?

07:54.106 --> 07:55.908
NIGHTMARE BUNNY.

07:55.908 --> 07:57.176
SO MANY LITTLE ONES ARE

07:57.176 --> 08:02.615
AFRAID OF THE BIG BUNNY.

08:02.615 --> 08:03.416
MANY ENCOUNTERS WITH THE

08:03.416 --> 08:03.883

THIS STORY'S ABOUT HOA'S, WHICH

08:54.033 --> 08:54.500
STANDS FOR HOMEOWNERS

08:54.500 --> 08:56.435
ASSOCIATIONS.

08:57.603 --> 08:59.238
HORSE ON ADDERALL, WHICH I

08:59.238 --> 09:00.806
BELIEVE IS THE POTENTIAL SEQUEL

09:00.806 --> 09:03.042
TO COCAINE BEAR.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.877
HOA'S, ALSO SOMETIMES KNOWN AS

09:04.877 --> 09:06.879
"COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS", ARE

09:06.879 --> 09:08.281
ENTITIES SET UP TO GOVERN GROUPS

09:08.281 --> 09:09.849
OF HOMES, LIKE SUBURBAN

NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENTS OR

CONDOS, AND OFTEN MAKE LOCAL

09:14.186 --> 09:15.454
LIKE THIS.

09:15.454 --> 09:16.923
IT'S A SIMPLE STORY OF A MAN

09:16.923 --> 09:18.758
WITH SOME SIMPLE NEEDS.

09:18.758 --> 09:22.295
SIT DOWN AND HAVE HIS LITTLE

09:22.295 --> 09:24.530
CHIPS AND A SODA IF HE WANTS,

09:24.530 --> 09:25.431
AND SAY HELLO TO SOME PEOPLE.

09:25.431 --> 09:26.499
TANYA'S TALKING ABOUT HER

09:26.499 --> 09:27.667
NEIGHBOR TED.

09:27.667 --> 09:28.935
I'LL BE 92 IN SEPTEMBER.

09:28.935 --> 09:29.902
AND THE BENCH OUTSIDE HIS

09:29.902 --> 09:30.903
DOOR.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.305
I HAVE A PLACE I LIKE TO COME

09:32.305 --> 09:33.606
OUT HERE AND SIT AND RELAX.

09:33.606 --> 09:35.107
NOTICES FROM HIS HOA, THE

09:35.107 --> 09:36.208
BETHANY VILLA ASSOCIATION,

09:36.208 --> 09:37.777
SAYING SIMPLY, "REMOVE YOUR

09:37.777 --> 09:39.111
BENCH FROM THE COMMON AREA, OR

09:39.111 --> 09:40.947
IT WILL BE REMOVED."

09:40.947 --> 09:42.715
THE MAN DESERVES A PLACE TO

09:42.715 --> 09:45.184
REST AND ENJOY NATURE AND EAT

09:45.184 --> 09:47.219
HIS LITTLE SNACKS AND SAY HELLO

09:47.219 --> 09:50.456
TO PEOPLE AND PET PUPPIES.

09:50.456 --> 09:52.158
John: YEAH, LET THAT MAN HAVE

09:52.158 --> 09:53.926
HIS FUCKING BENCH!

09:53.926 --> 09:54.961
HE DESERVES TO EAT SNACKS AND

09:54.961 --> 09:55.928
PET PUPPIES!

09:55.928 --> 09:57.096
WHICH IS, BY THE WAY, THE SINGLE

09:57.096 --> 09:58.564
GREATEST WAY YOU COULD SPEND A

09:58.564 --> 09:59.865
DAY.

09:59.865 --> 10:01.100
NOTHING TOPS THAT.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.435
IF ON THE DAY THAT YOUR BABY WAS

10:02.435 --> 10:04.170
BORN, A FRIEND CAME AND TOLD YOU

10:04.170 --> 10:05.504
THEY SPENT THE AFTERNOON EATING

10:05.504 --> 10:07.640
SNACKS AND PETTING PUPPIES, THEY

10:07.640 --> 10:09.442
HAD A BETTER DAY THAN YOU DID.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.509
THE MIRACLE OF LIFE CAN'T

10:10.509 --> 10:11.811
COMPETE WITH THE SIMPLE JOY OF

10:11.811 --> 10:12.778
MUNCHIN' SNACKS AND SCRATCHIN'

10:12.778 --> 10:14.981
BACKS.

10:14.981 --> 10:15.581
NOM, NOM, NOM, NOM-- AND THIS

10:15.581 --> 10:19.118
IS TRUE-- A RUB-RUB.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.586
ALSO, QUICK SHOUT-OUT TO TANYA

10:20.586 --> 10:21.954
THERE, THE NEIGHBOR BILLED BY

10:21.954 --> 10:23.055
THAT LOCAL STATION AS SIMPLY,

10:23.055 --> 10:25.124
"NEIGHBOR AND TED FAN."

10:25.124 --> 10:26.525
SHE MAY BE A TED FAN, BUT I, FOR

10:26.525 --> 10:27.593
ONE, AM A TANYA FAN, BECAUSE I

10:27.593 --> 10:28.894
SEE THE EFFORT THAT IT TAKES TO

10:28.894 --> 10:31.464
PUT ON A FULL FACE FIRST THING

10:31.464 --> 10:32.631
IN THE MORNING AND GO ON THE

10:32.631 --> 10:33.366
NEWS, JUST TO SAY, "STOP FUCKING

10:33.366 --> 10:36.268
WITH TED!"

10:36.268 --> 10:37.737
BUT THAT IS NOT A ONE-OFF.

10:37.737 --> 10:39.105
STORIES OF HOA'S BEING PETTY ARE

10:39.105 --> 10:40.940
LEGION.

10:40.940 --> 10:42.341
A VALLEY HOMEOWNER SAYS HER

10:42.341 --> 10:43.609
HOA WANTS TO FINE HER BECAUSE

10:43.609 --> 10:46.112
SHE INSTALLED ARTIFICIAL GRASS.

10:46.112 --> 10:47.246
A HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION

10:47.246 --> 10:48.614
TOLD ONE SAN ANTONIO FAMILY

10:48.614 --> 10:49.915
THEIR HOLIDAY DECORATIONS ARE UP

10:49.915 --> 10:51.117
TOO EARLY, SO THEY'VE GOTTA COME

10:51.117 --> 10:52.852
DOWN.

10:52.852 --> 10:54.954
I GOT LOTS AND LOTS OF

10:54.954 --> 10:59.258
LETTERS FROM THE HOA TELLING ME

10:59.258 --> 11:00.893
TO STOP FEEDING THE DUCKS.

11:00.893 --> 11:03.262
I MEAN, WHEN YOU RECEIVE A

11:03.262 --> 11:05.798
VIOLATION FOR A TREE NOT BEING

11:05.798 --> 11:06.365
TREE-SHAPED, IT BOGGLES YOUR

11:06.365 --> 11:08.934
MIND.

11:08.934 --> 11:11.103
John: YEAH, OF COURSE IT

11:11.103 --> 11:11.737
DOES.

11:11.737 --> 11:12.905
BECAUSE WHAT DOES "NOT

11:12.905 --> 11:14.407
TREE-SHAPED" EVEN MEAN?

11:14.407 --> 11:15.708
IF IT HAS BRANCHES, BARK, AND A

11:15.708 --> 11:17.009
PLACE FOR A SQUIRREL TO STORE

11:17.009 --> 11:18.244
SOME NUTS AND GET SOME FUCKS,

11:18.244 --> 11:19.678
IT'S A TREE.

11:19.678 --> 11:22.681
IT'S TREE-SHAPED, BY DEFINITION.

11:22.681 --> 11:24.550
THE FACT IS, A LOT OF PEOPLE

11:24.550 --> 11:25.818
LIVE IN HOA'S.

11:25.818 --> 11:27.653
29% OF THE U.S. POPULATION LIVES

11:27.653 --> 11:28.487
IN A COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION.

11:28.487 --> 11:29.422
AND IT'S ACTUALLY INCREASINGLY

11:29.422 --> 11:32.825
HARD TO FIND A HOME THAT DOESN'T

11:32.825 --> 11:34.360
COME WITH ONE.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.961
AS OF ALL THE NEW SINGLE-FAMILY

11:35.961 --> 11:37.663
HOMES SOLD IN 2021, 82% WERE IN

11:37.663 --> 11:40.332
AN HOA.

11:40.332 --> 11:42.802
THAT'S UP FROM AROUND 40% IN

11:42.802 --> 11:44.070
1990.

11:44.070 --> 11:45.905
WHICH IS PRETTY REMARKABLE,

11:45.905 --> 11:46.772
GIVEN THAT, WHEN ONE LOCAL

11:46.772 --> 11:47.840
STATION ASKED VIEWERS HOW THEY

11:47.840 --> 11:48.908
FELT ABOUT THEIR HOA, THE

11:48.908 --> 11:51.610
RESULTS WERE NEARLY UNIVERSALLY

11:51.610 --> 11:52.144
NEGATIVE, WITH ONE NOTABLE

11:52.144 --> 11:53.579
EXCEPTION.

11:53.579 --> 11:54.780
THIS WAS A RARE COMMENT, "I

11:54.780 --> 11:55.815
LIKE OUR HOA...

11:55.815 --> 11:57.349
I GUESS I'M THE LUCKY ONE?"

11:57.349 --> 11:59.051
BUT IT WAS QUICKLY FOLLOWED

11:59.051 --> 11:59.618
WITH, "DON'T COUNT YOURSELF

11:59.618 --> 12:00.753
LUCKY TOO SOON.

12:00.753 --> 12:03.456
EVERY HOA IS JUST ONE VOTE AWAY

12:03.456 --> 12:05.758
FROM HELLISH NIGHTMARES."

12:05.758 --> 12:07.860
John: WOW, "ONE VOTE AWAY

12:07.860 --> 12:08.961
FROM HELLISH NIGHTMARES" IS A

12:08.961 --> 12:10.729
PRETTY INTENSE COMMENT.

12:10.729 --> 12:11.831
IT'S ALSO, INCIDENTALLY, THE

12:11.831 --> 12:16.001
DNC'S SOLE CAMPAIGN MESSAGE FOR

12:16.001 --> 12:16.502
THE LAST TWO ELECTIONS.

12:16.502 --> 12:17.703
SO IF THEY'RE THIS WIDELY USED,

12:17.703 --> 12:19.972
AND THIS WIDELY LOATHED,

12:19.972 --> 12:21.273
TONIGHT, LET'S LOOK AT HOA'S,

12:21.273 --> 12:22.908
WHAT THEY ARE, WHAT PURPOSE THEY

12:22.908 --> 12:24.043
SERVE, AND THE SURPRISING POWERS

12:24.043 --> 12:25.811
THEY HAVE TO WREAK HAVOC IN

12:25.811 --> 12:27.079
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.614
AND LET'S START WITH THE BASICS,

12:28.614 --> 12:30.015
COURTESY OF THIS OLD EXPLAINER

12:30.015 --> 12:31.517
VIDEO.

12:31.517 --> 12:32.485
JUST WHAT IS A COMMUNITY

12:32.485 --> 12:33.986
ASSOCIATION?

12:33.986 --> 12:35.387
THE ASSOCIATION IS A LEGAL

12:35.387 --> 12:37.389
ENTITY CREATED AS A RESULT OF A

12:37.389 --> 12:39.024
PLANNED COMMUNITY.

12:39.024 --> 12:39.859
A BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS

12:39.859 --> 12:42.661
RESPONSIBLE FOR GOVERNING YOUR

12:42.661 --> 12:43.796
ASSOCIATION.

12:43.796 --> 12:45.131
WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE

12:45.131 --> 12:46.432
BOARD MEMBERS AND COMMITTEE

12:46.432 --> 12:47.733
MEMBERS CAN ENSURE THAT YOUR

12:47.733 --> 12:48.868
COMMUNITY WILL RUN SMOOTHLY AND

12:48.868 --> 12:51.036
EFFECTIVELY.

12:51.036 --> 12:52.271
AFTER ALL, BOARD MEMBERS ARE

12:52.271 --> 12:54.140
OWNERS JUST LIKE YOURSELF.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.374
John: OKAY, YOU CAN REALLY

12:55.374 --> 12:56.809
TELL THAT VIDEO'S FROM THE '90S,

12:56.809 --> 12:58.344
NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S SHOT WITH

12:58.344 --> 13:00.412
A QUALITY THAT CAN ONLY BE

13:00.412 --> 13:00.946
DESCRIBED AS "AFTER SCHOOL

13:00.946 --> 13:02.081
PORNO," BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE

13:02.081 --> 13:03.149
BOARD IN QUESTION IS JUST THREE

13:03.149 --> 13:04.517
MEN AND ONE WOMAN THAT THEY ALL

13:04.517 --> 13:05.985
IGNORE.

13:05.985 --> 13:06.986
IN OTHER WORDS, ALMOST EVERY

13:06.986 --> 13:08.754
'90S SITCOM.

13:08.754 --> 13:10.523
THE POINT IS, HOA'S ARE RUN BY

13:10.523 --> 13:12.458
ELECTED BOARDS OF YOUR FELLOW

13:12.458 --> 13:13.259
HOMEOWNERS.

13:13.259 --> 13:15.094
AND THEY REQUIRE THE PAYMENT OF

13:15.094 --> 13:16.428
DUES, WHICH AVERAGE AROUND

13:16.428 --> 13:18.197
$200-$300 A MONTH, BUT CAN BE

13:18.197 --> 13:19.431
MUCH MORE DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU

13:19.431 --> 13:20.299
LIVE.

13:20.299 --> 13:21.700
AND IN RETURN, THE HOA COVERS

13:21.700 --> 13:23.335
UPKEEP OF THE COMMON AREAS AND

13:23.335 --> 13:24.937
AMENITIES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

13:24.937 --> 13:25.804
LIKE PLAYGROUNDS OR SWIMMING

13:25.804 --> 13:26.739
POOLS.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.641
THEY ALSO, CRUCIALLY, ENFORCE

13:28.641 --> 13:31.443
ARCHITECTURAL AND LANDSCAPING

13:31.443 --> 13:32.411
GUIDELINES, LIKE "NO BENCHES" OR

13:32.411 --> 13:34.113
"TREES MUST BE TREE-SHAPED"--

13:34.113 --> 13:35.681
WHICH ARE OFTEN TRYING TO PUSH

13:35.681 --> 13:39.318
AESTHETIC UNIFORMITY AND

13:39.318 --> 13:39.852
PRESERVE PROPERTY VALUES.

13:39.852 --> 13:41.387
YOU CAN FIND HOA RULES LIKE,

13:41.387 --> 13:43.689
HOMES MAY DISPLAY A MAXIMUM OF 2

13:43.689 --> 13:45.157
EXTERIOR DECORATIVE OBJECTS, OR

13:45.157 --> 13:46.559
"ALL GARAGE DOORS MUST BE

13:46.559 --> 13:48.227
PAINTED BENJAMIN MOORE

13:48.227 --> 13:50.162
MAYONNAISE OC-85."

13:50.162 --> 13:51.797
AND ONE ARIZONA HOA REQUIRED

13:51.797 --> 13:53.632
THAT FRONT YARD LANDSCAPING MUST

13:53.632 --> 13:55.568
CONTAIN A MINIMUM OF ONE 36-INCH

13:55.568 --> 13:59.738
BOX TREE, ONE 24-INCH BOX TREE,

13:59.738 --> 14:00.439
TEN 5-GALLON SHRUBS, AND TEN

14:00.439 --> 14:01.941
1-GALLON SHRUBS."

14:01.941 --> 14:03.142
AND I GENUINELY CAN'T TELL IF

14:03.142 --> 14:04.343
THOSE ARE HOA REQUIREMENTS FOR

14:04.343 --> 14:06.378
TAKING CARE OF YOUR LAWN OR

14:06.378 --> 14:08.714
RULES TO SETTLERS OF CATAN.

14:08.714 --> 14:10.516
AND THOSE RULES AREN'T JUST

14:10.516 --> 14:11.684
ADVISORY, THEY'RE ENFORCED

14:11.684 --> 14:12.918
THROUGH FINES.

14:12.918 --> 14:13.986
AND HOA'S CAN BE PRETTY

14:13.986 --> 14:15.054
UNFORGIVING ABOUT HANDING THEM

14:15.054 --> 14:15.888
OUT.

14:15.888 --> 14:17.156
TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT

14:17.156 --> 14:19.825
DEBRA BLUE'S WAKE COUNTY HOME.

14:19.825 --> 14:20.593
THE COLOR OF HER SHUTTERS HAD

14:20.593 --> 14:21.560
HER FACING STEEP FINES WITH HER

14:21.560 --> 14:22.995
HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION.

14:22.995 --> 14:24.930
THEY DECIDED TO FINE ME $25 A

14:24.930 --> 14:26.465
DAY.

14:26.465 --> 14:28.567
DEBRA PAID CLOSE TO $2,000 IN

14:28.567 --> 14:29.668
FINES AND TOOK DOWN HER PLUM

14:29.668 --> 14:31.136
SHUTTERS.

14:31.136 --> 14:32.204
WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY MET

14:32.204 --> 14:33.339
WITH A RESPONSE.

14:33.339 --> 14:36.008
NOW THEY WERE GOING TO FINE ME

14:36.008 --> 14:36.609
IN VIOLATION OF TAKING THE

14:36.609 --> 14:38.544
SHUTTERS OFF THE HOUSE AND START

14:38.544 --> 14:39.912
FINING ME AGAIN.

14:39.912 --> 14:41.513
John: THAT IS ABSURD.

14:41.513 --> 14:43.015
SHE GOT FINED FOR THE COLOR OF

14:43.015 --> 14:46.418
HER SHUTTERS, TOOK THEM DOWN,

14:46.418 --> 14:47.253
AND THEN GOT IN TROUBLE FOR THE

14:47.253 --> 14:47.686
ABSENCE OF SHUTTERS.

14:47.686 --> 14:48.320
IT'S ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS

14:48.320 --> 14:49.788
WHERE NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO YOU

14:49.788 --> 14:51.223
LOSE, SORT OF LIKE GOING ON

14:51.223 --> 14:52.258
"THE VOICE."

14:52.258 --> 14:54.293
SURE, THERE ARE TECHNICALLY

14:54.293 --> 14:56.395
WINNERS, BUT NAME A SINGLE ONE.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.864
THE SHOW HAS BEEN ON FOR A

14:58.864 --> 14:59.632
CONSERVATIVE 50 YEARS AND NOT A

14:59.632 --> 15:00.633
SINGLE WINNER IS A HOUSEHOLD

15:00.633 --> 15:01.100
NAME.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.334
SERIOUSLY, TELL ME THE FIRST AND

15:02.334 --> 15:05.804
LAST NAME OF JUST ONE.

15:05.804 --> 15:06.205
YOU CAN'T.

15:06.205 --> 15:07.273
NO ONE CAN.

15:07.273 --> 15:08.641
NOT EVEN HONKY TONK FRANKENSTEIN

15:08.641 --> 15:10.843
COULD DO IT.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.111
AND SOME HOA'S CAN BE

15:12.111 --> 15:13.445
SURPRISINGLY AGGRESSIVE ABOUT

15:13.445 --> 15:14.680
ACTIVELY SEEKING OUT RULE

15:14.680 --> 15:16.181
VIOLATORS, AS THIS MAN

15:16.181 --> 15:17.583
DISCOVERED.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.717
THREE YEARS AFTER BUYING THIS

15:18.717 --> 15:20.286
PROPERTY, THE HENRYS RECEIVED A

15:20.286 --> 15:21.654
LETTER FROM THEIR HOMEOWNERS'

15:21.654 --> 15:23.622
ASSOCIATION.

15:23.622 --> 15:24.990
SAYING THAT THEY WERE DOING

15:24.990 --> 15:26.392
AN AUDIT AND THEY NOTICED THAT I

15:26.392 --> 15:28.394
HAD A SHED IN MY BACKYARD, AND

15:28.394 --> 15:29.328
IT WASN'T APPROVED BY MY

15:29.328 --> 15:31.196
HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION.

15:31.196 --> 15:32.464
GAVIN, WHO WAS A DISABLED

15:32.464 --> 15:34.333
VETERAN, TOLD THE HOA THE SHED

15:34.333 --> 15:36.468
WAS THERE BEFORE HE BOUGHT THE

15:36.468 --> 15:38.570
PROPERTY AND NONE OF HIS

15:38.570 --> 15:39.471
NEIGHBORS HAVE EVER COMPLAINED.

15:39.471 --> 15:40.673
SINCE YOU CAN'T SEE THE SHED

15:40.673 --> 15:42.241
FROM THE FRONT YARD AND NO ONE

15:42.241 --> 15:43.609
CAME KNOCKING AT THE HENRYS'

15:43.609 --> 15:45.177
FRONT DOOR, THEY ASKED THEIR

15:45.177 --> 15:47.946
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION HOW THEY

15:47.946 --> 15:48.614
WERE ABLE TO PERFORM AN AUDIT.

15:48.614 --> 15:49.782
THAT'S WHEN THEY WERE TOLD OVER

15:49.782 --> 15:50.949
THE PHONE THAT GOOGLE MAPS WAS

15:50.949 --> 15:52.451
USED TO SCOPE OUT THEIR

15:52.451 --> 15:53.552
BACKYARD.

15:53.552 --> 15:55.054
John: YEAH, THEY SPIED ON HIM

15:55.054 --> 15:56.722
WITH GOOGLE MAPS.

15:56.722 --> 15:57.423
WHICH FEELS EXTREME.

15:57.423 --> 15:58.357
IF YOU'RE RELYING ON THE

15:58.357 --> 16:00.125
ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE SPACE

16:00.125 --> 16:01.794
PROGRAM TO FIND OUT WHAT'S IN

16:01.794 --> 16:02.828
SOMEONE'S BACKYARD, IT'S

16:02.828 --> 16:04.697
PROBABLY NOT YOUR BUSINESS.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.598
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW

16:06.598 --> 16:08.334
HOA'S GET THE AUTHORITY TO DO

16:08.334 --> 16:09.568
ALL THIS, THE ANSWER IS THEY'RE

16:09.568 --> 16:11.103
BASICALLY BORN WITH IT.

16:11.103 --> 16:12.338
HOA'S ARE TYPICALLY CREATED BY

16:12.338 --> 16:15.107
DEVELOPERS WHEN THEY BUILD A NEW

16:15.107 --> 16:15.974
NEIGHBORHOOD.

16:15.974 --> 16:16.809
THEY WRITE THE HOA INTO DEED

16:16.809 --> 16:18.677
RESTRICTIONS, WITH MEMBERSHIP

16:18.677 --> 16:19.812
AUTOMATIC UPON PURCHASING YOUR

16:19.812 --> 16:20.913
HOME.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.147
AND THEY'RE SET UP AS

16:22.147 --> 16:23.449
NOT-FOR-PROFIT PRIVATE

16:23.449 --> 16:24.717
CORPORATIONS THAT CAN OFTEN

16:24.717 --> 16:25.284
FUNCTION LIKE A LOCAL

16:25.284 --> 16:26.352
GOVERNMENT.

16:26.352 --> 16:27.886
SOME HOA'S HANDLE STREET PAVING,

16:27.886 --> 16:29.188
SNOW PLOWING, LIGHTING, AND RUN

16:29.188 --> 16:32.024
PRIVATE SEWER AND WATER SYSTEMS.

16:32.024 --> 16:33.258
AND OTHERS EVEN DABBLE IN

16:33.258 --> 16:35.127
TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT.

16:35.127 --> 16:36.662
IN THE PARKVIEW COMMUNITY IN

16:36.662 --> 16:39.531
SPRING VALLEY, AN HOA BOARD

16:39.531 --> 16:40.299
EMAIL SAYS THEY INSTALLED THIS

16:40.299 --> 16:41.133
- A SPEED CAMERA.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.869
THEY SAY MORE ARE COMING.

16:43.869 --> 16:44.470
NEIGHBOR TED MORRIS SAYS WHAT

16:44.470 --> 16:45.237
WORRIES HIM AND SOME OTHER

16:45.237 --> 16:46.472
NEIGHBORS IS HOW MUCH A

16:46.472 --> 16:47.840
VIOLATION WILL COST YOU FOR

16:47.840 --> 16:49.541
GOING SLIGHTLY OVER 15 MILES AN

16:49.541 --> 16:50.542
HOUR.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.511
THE NOTICE SAYS IT'S $250 FOR

16:52.511 --> 16:54.847
THE FIRST TICKET, $500 FOR THE

16:54.847 --> 16:57.483
SECOND, $1,000 FOR THE THIRD,

16:57.483 --> 16:59.518
AND ANY MORE VIOLATIONS FOR YOU

16:59.518 --> 17:01.220
AND YOUR GUESTS.

17:01.220 --> 17:04.490
John: $1000 SPEEDING TICKETS,

17:04.490 --> 17:06.191
GIVEN OUT NOT BY THE CITY, BUT

17:06.191 --> 17:06.759
BY THE HOA!

17:06.759 --> 17:07.359
BASICALLY, THE WAY HOA'S WORK

17:07.359 --> 17:08.694
IS, THEY GET TO SET THE RULES,

17:08.694 --> 17:11.397
AND SELECT THE PUNISHMENT FOR

17:11.397 --> 17:13.232
BREAKING THEM.

17:13.232 --> 17:14.199
THINK OF IT LIKE DISNEYWORLD.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.534
WHEN YOU WALK INTO THE MOUSE'S

17:15.534 --> 17:17.202
HOUSE, YOU PLAY BY THE MOUSE'S

17:17.202 --> 17:19.071
RULES, AND IF YOU STEP OUT OF

17:19.071 --> 17:21.006
LINE, GOOFY IS ALLOWED TO BREAK

17:21.006 --> 17:23.542
YOUR FUCKING KNEES.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.210
AND THE EXISTENCE OF HOA'S IS

17:25.210 --> 17:27.112
SOMETHING MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

17:27.112 --> 17:27.980
ACTUALLY APPRECIATE.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.481
CASH-STRAPPED MUNICIPALITIES

17:29.481 --> 17:30.582
LIKE THEM BECAUSE DEVELOPERS

17:30.582 --> 17:32.751
BUILD ROADS AND PARKS AND PASS

17:32.751 --> 17:33.752
THE COSTS ALONG TO THE

17:33.752 --> 17:34.987
HOMEOWNERS.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.021
IN FACT, MANY MUNICIPALITIES

17:36.021 --> 17:37.589
EVEN MANDATE THE CREATION OF

17:37.589 --> 17:39.191
HOA'S IN NEW RESIDENTIAL

17:39.191 --> 17:42.060
DEVELOPMENTS.

17:42.060 --> 17:42.694
WHICH MIGHT BE WHY THE RISE OF

17:42.694 --> 17:43.962
HOA'S HAS BEEN CALLED "THE MOST

17:43.962 --> 17:45.330
SIGNIFICANT PRIVATIZATION OF

17:45.330 --> 17:46.064
LOCAL GOVERNMENT

17:46.064 --> 17:47.566
RESPONSIBILITIES IN RECENT

17:47.566 --> 17:48.700
TIMES."

17:48.700 --> 17:50.035
AND THAT GETS TO AN IMPORTANT

17:50.035 --> 17:51.103
POINT HERE, BECAUSE HOA'S CAN

17:51.103 --> 17:52.538
HAVE THE AUTHORITY OF A

17:52.538 --> 17:54.373
GOVERNMENT, AND COLLECT FEES AND

17:54.373 --> 17:55.941
FINES LIKE ONE, BUT WHEN IT

17:55.941 --> 17:57.543
COMES TO ACCOUNTABILITY, THEY

17:57.543 --> 17:58.710
CAN ACTIVELY RESIST IT, IN WAYS

17:58.710 --> 17:59.812
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS COULD ONLY

17:59.812 --> 18:01.547
DREAM ABOUT.

18:01.547 --> 18:02.714
AFTER THE RESIDENTS OF ONE HOA

18:02.714 --> 18:04.183
IN ARIZONA POSTED SOME SOCIAL

18:04.183 --> 18:05.484
MEDIA COMMENTS ABOUT AN UPCOMING

18:05.484 --> 18:07.719
BOARD ELECTION, THE HOA DEMANDED

18:07.719 --> 18:09.354
THEY REMOVE POSTS THAT WERE

18:09.354 --> 18:10.756
CRITICAL OF ITS BOARD, AND

18:10.756 --> 18:11.757
THREATENED TO FINE THEM AS MUCH

18:11.757 --> 18:13.358
AS $250 A DAY IF THEY DIDN'T.

18:13.358 --> 18:15.527
AND WHILE THEY EVENTUALLY WALKED

18:15.527 --> 18:18.964
BACK THAT THREAT, THAT'S A

18:18.964 --> 18:20.299
PRETTY STRIKING LEVEL OF

18:20.299 --> 18:21.767
HOSTILITY TOWARD BASIC SCRUTINY,

18:21.767 --> 18:23.435
EVEN BEFORE YOU LEARN THIS IS

18:23.435 --> 18:25.671
HOW ONE BOARD MEMBER DEALT WITH

18:25.671 --> 18:26.939
PRESS INQUIRIES AS THE STORY

18:26.939 --> 18:27.873
UNFOLDED.

18:27.873 --> 18:28.540
I GOT TO ASK YOU--

18:28.540 --> 18:29.308
NO COMMENT.

18:29.308 --> 18:30.209
NO, I'M SORRY, BUT YOU HAVE A

18:30.209 --> 18:30.576
LOT OF--

18:30.576 --> 18:31.343
GET AWAY FROM ME.

18:31.343 --> 18:31.944
NO, YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF--

18:31.944 --> 18:32.744
GET AWAY FROM ME!

18:32.744 --> 18:34.446
THAT'S VALVISTA LAKE'S BOARD

18:34.446 --> 18:35.881
DIRECTOR TODD McCOY FOLLOWING A

18:35.881 --> 18:37.616
PRIVATE BOARD MEETING TONIGHT IN

18:37.616 --> 18:38.016
GILBERT.

18:38.016 --> 18:39.618
AFTER BEING SHOVED, WE

18:39.618 --> 18:40.953
REITERATED TO McCOY THAT THE

18:40.953 --> 18:42.321
COMMUNITY WAS VERY UPSET.

18:42.321 --> 18:43.455
TO WHICH, HE REPLIED--

18:43.455 --> 18:44.623
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM RIGHT

18:44.623 --> 18:46.458
NOW.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.260
John: HOLY SHIT, HE CAME AT

18:48.260 --> 18:50.229
THAT REPORTER WITH THE FIRE OF A

18:50.229 --> 18:52.197
THOUSAND MEL GIBSONS.

18:52.197 --> 18:53.565
THERE'S ALMOST NO SCENARIO WHERE

18:53.565 --> 18:54.800
YELLING "GET AWAY FROM ME" THAT

18:54.800 --> 18:56.201
AGGRESSIVELY IS CALLED FOR,

18:56.201 --> 18:58.170
ASIDE FROM MAYBE BUMPING INTO

18:58.170 --> 19:00.272
EZRA MILLER IN HAWAII.

19:00.272 --> 19:01.507
AND AT THIS POINT, YOU PROBABLY

19:01.507 --> 19:02.341
WON'T BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT

19:02.341 --> 19:04.543
"PRIVATE ASSOCIATIONS DESIGNED

19:04.543 --> 19:07.145
TO HAVE THE FORCE OF LAW IN

19:07.145 --> 19:07.779
SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOODS," HAVE A

19:07.779 --> 19:08.780
HISTORY OF BEING USED TO EXCLUDE

19:08.780 --> 19:10.148
CERTAIN GROUPS.

19:10.148 --> 19:11.383
AS WE DISCUSSED IN OUR HOUSING

19:11.383 --> 19:12.584
DISCRIMINATION PIECE, MANY

19:12.584 --> 19:14.019
NEIGHBORHOODS HAD RACIAL

19:14.019 --> 19:15.988
COVENANTS BARRING THE SALE OF

19:15.988 --> 19:17.422
HOUSING TO BLACK AMERICANS.

19:17.422 --> 19:19.424
AND IN SOME CASES, HOA'S TRIED

19:19.424 --> 19:20.692
TO ENFORCE THOSE COVENANTS, EVEN

19:20.692 --> 19:22.794
AFTER THE SUPREME COURT RULED

19:22.794 --> 19:24.096
THEM UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

19:24.096 --> 19:26.198
BUT EVEN TODAY, THERE ARE CASES

19:26.198 --> 19:26.832
WHERE HOA'S ARE USED TO ACTIVELY

19:26.832 --> 19:28.600
EXCLUDE CERTAIN TYPES OF

19:28.600 --> 19:29.935
RESIDENTS.

19:29.935 --> 19:31.436
JUST LAST JUNE, THE BOARD OF THE

19:31.436 --> 19:33.272
PROVIDENCE HOA IN DENTON COUNTY,

19:33.272 --> 19:33.972
TEXAS-- WHICH OVERSEES A

19:33.972 --> 19:37.376
COMMUNITY MADE UP OF 2,200 HOMES

19:37.376 --> 19:38.043
- PASSED A RULE THAT WOULD BAN

19:38.043 --> 19:39.878
RENTING A HOUSE TO ANYONE USING

19:39.878 --> 19:42.114
A PUBLICLY FINANCED OR

19:42.114 --> 19:43.415
SUBSIDIZED HOUSING PROGRAM, SUCH

19:43.415 --> 19:45.017
AS SECTION 8.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.552
AND THE IMPACTS OF THAT WERE

19:46.552 --> 19:47.819
IMMEDIATE.

19:47.819 --> 19:48.954
REVISHA THREAT FEARS BEING

19:48.954 --> 19:49.988
HOMELESS SOON.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.790
THAT'S BECAUSE THE RULES HAVE

19:51.790 --> 19:53.292
CHANGED IN THEIR PROVIDENCE

19:53.292 --> 19:54.626
VILLAGE SUBDIVISION.

19:54.626 --> 19:55.327
I SIT IN MY LIVING ROOM AND

19:55.327 --> 19:56.695
CRY 'CAUSE I JUST DON'T KNOW

19:56.695 --> 19:58.063
WHAT TO DO.

19:58.063 --> 19:59.798
John: THAT IS TERRIBLE.

19:59.798 --> 20:01.233
BUT IT'S NOT JUST HER, THAT NEW

20:01.233 --> 20:02.434
RULE THREATENED TO DISPLACE MORE

20:02.434 --> 20:04.336
THAN 150 FAMILIES RENTING IN THE

20:04.336 --> 20:05.704
NEIGHBORHOOD, WITH BLACK

20:05.704 --> 20:08.106
FAMILIES MAKING UP 93% OF THOSE

20:08.106 --> 20:09.341
HOUSEHOLDS.

20:09.341 --> 20:11.209
AND I KNOW THOSE HOA OFFICIALS

20:11.209 --> 20:12.411
MIGHT NOT THINK OF THEMSELVES AS

20:12.411 --> 20:14.479
RACISTS, BUT 93% IS A PRETTY

20:14.479 --> 20:18.083
SOLID A FOR RACISM.

20:18.083 --> 20:18.884
THAT HOA'S POLICY IS NOW UNDER

20:18.884 --> 20:20.319
INVESTIGATION, BUT THE FACT IS,

20:20.319 --> 20:22.321
THERE IS NOTHING IN STATE OR

20:22.321 --> 20:23.488
FEDERAL LAW THAT EXPLICITLY

20:23.488 --> 20:25.490
FORBIDS HOA'S FROM ENACTING BANS

20:25.490 --> 20:26.558
LIKE THIS.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.627
IT'S BASICALLY A SEGREGATION

20:28.627 --> 20:29.928
LOOPHOLE, WHICH, BY THE WAY,

20:29.928 --> 20:31.597
WOULD BE A PRETTY GOOD SLOGAN

20:31.597 --> 20:32.965
FOR THE SUBURBS.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.566
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WELL,

20:34.566 --> 20:36.034
THIS ALL SEEMS FUCKED UP, BUT

20:36.034 --> 20:38.103
THANK GOD THERE AREN'T PRIVATE

20:38.103 --> 20:39.471
COMPANIES MAKING THIS WORSE!"

20:39.471 --> 20:41.039
HOLD ON, I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS.

20:41.039 --> 20:43.108
BECAUSE AT THIS POINT, WE SHOULD

20:43.108 --> 20:45.877
DISCUSS MANAGEMENT COMPANIES.

20:45.877 --> 20:47.379
YOU SEE, WHILE, AS I MENTIONED,

20:47.379 --> 20:49.081
ALL THE BIG DECISION-MAKING IN

20:49.081 --> 20:50.649
HOA'S IS DONE BY ELECTED BOARDS

20:50.649 --> 20:52.084
OF HOMEOWNERS, THEY MAY NOT HAVE

20:52.084 --> 20:53.552
THE TIME OR SKILLS TO DO

20:53.552 --> 20:55.020
EVERYTHING RUNNING AN HOA

20:55.020 --> 20:56.822
ENTAILS, OR THEY MAY NOT WANT TO

20:56.822 --> 20:58.090
GET THEIR HANDS DIRTY POLICING

20:58.090 --> 20:59.858
THEIR NEIGHBORS.

20:59.858 --> 21:01.693
THAT'S WHY THE MAJORITY OF HOAS

21:01.693 --> 21:03.729
HIRE PROFESSIONAL COMPANIES TO

21:03.729 --> 21:06.164
HANDLE THEIR DAY-TO-DAY NEEDS,

21:06.164 --> 21:07.599
UNDER THE BOARD'S DIRECTION.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.401
HERE'S HOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST,

21:09.401 --> 21:11.470
ASSOCIA, PITCHES ITSELF.

21:11.470 --> 21:12.838
THE PEOPLE WHO SERVE ON OUR

21:12.838 --> 21:14.906
BOARDS ARE VOLUNTEERS, AND FOR

21:14.906 --> 21:18.644
MOST OF THEM, THEY HAVE OTHER

21:18.644 --> 21:19.811
FULL-TIME JOBS.

21:19.811 --> 21:21.680
SO, OUR ROLE IS TO COME

21:21.680 --> 21:24.449
ALONGSIDE THEM AND HELP DO THE

21:24.449 --> 21:25.751
HEAVY LIFTING OF WHAT IT TAKES

21:25.751 --> 21:27.185
TO MANAGE THAT NEIGHBORHOOD THAT

21:27.185 --> 21:28.720
THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE TIME FOR

21:28.720 --> 21:30.222
OR THE EXPERTISE FOR.

21:30.222 --> 21:32.624
OUR ROLE IS REALLY TO HELP THEM

21:32.624 --> 21:34.159
ACHIEVE THAT VISION.

21:34.159 --> 21:35.193
John: NOW, IN THEORY, THAT

21:35.193 --> 21:36.294
SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD, DOESN'T IT?

21:36.294 --> 21:37.396
BUT IN PRACTICE, IT CAN GET MUCH

21:37.396 --> 21:39.698
MESSIER THAN THAT.

21:39.698 --> 21:41.333
REMEMBER TED, WHO WAS GETTING

21:41.333 --> 21:42.401
HIS BENCH TAKEN AWAY?

21:42.401 --> 21:43.735
HIS NEIGHBORHOOD WAS RUN BY

21:43.735 --> 21:45.103
ASSOCIA.

21:45.103 --> 21:46.271
SO IF ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS

21:46.271 --> 21:47.239
HELP A NEIGHBORHOOD "ACHIEVE A

21:47.239 --> 21:48.774
VISION," AS LONG AS THAT VISION

21:48.774 --> 21:50.008
INCLUDES "TED DOESN'T GET TO SIT

21:50.008 --> 21:51.143
DOWN," I GUESS, MISSION

21:51.143 --> 21:53.712
ACCOMPLISHED.

21:53.712 --> 21:54.479
THE PROBLEM IS, WHEN YOU

21:54.479 --> 21:55.947
INTRODUCE FOR-PROFIT COMPANIES

21:55.947 --> 21:57.916
TO FIND PROBLEMS IN YOUR

21:57.916 --> 21:59.618
NEIGHBORHOOD, THINGS CAN CHANGE

21:59.618 --> 22:01.353
FAST.

22:01.353 --> 22:02.454
MANY OF THESE MANAGEMENT

22:02.454 --> 22:03.522
COMPANIES HAVE PEOPLE WHOSE JOB

22:03.522 --> 22:06.958
IS TO DRIVE AROUND

22:06.958 --> 22:07.492
NEIGHBORHOODS, LOOKING FOR

22:07.492 --> 22:08.493
INFRACTIONS.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.895
IF YOU LOOK AT THAT LETTER THAT

22:09.895 --> 22:10.896
TED GOT REGARDING HIS BENCH,

22:10.896 --> 22:11.963
YOU'LL SEE THAT IT SAYS THE

22:11.963 --> 22:14.299
INFRACTION WAS NOTED BY THE

22:14.299 --> 22:14.866
ASSOCIA ARIZONA "INSPECTION

22:14.866 --> 22:16.668
TEAM."

22:16.668 --> 22:17.602
AND JUST WATCH AS ONE WOMAN

22:17.602 --> 22:19.104
EXPLAINS JUST HOW QUICKLY THINGS

22:19.104 --> 22:20.405
SNOWBALLED AFTER A NEW

22:20.405 --> 22:21.907
MANAGEMENT COMPANY TOOK OVER HER

22:21.907 --> 22:23.275
HOA.

22:23.275 --> 22:24.843
FIRST, THE HOA TOLD HER HER

22:24.843 --> 22:26.178
TRASH CANS COULDN'T BE VISIBLE

22:26.178 --> 22:27.112
FROM THE STREET.

22:27.112 --> 22:29.014
YOU HAVE TO TURN YOUR HEAD SO

22:29.014 --> 22:31.650
FAR OVER LIKE THIS TO SEE IT FOR

22:31.650 --> 22:33.485
THE SECOND THAT YOU ARE PASSING

22:33.485 --> 22:34.553
MY HOUSE.

22:34.553 --> 22:36.254
SO SHE MOVED THEM INSIDE.

22:36.254 --> 22:37.456
WHICH IS VERY HARD TO GET

22:37.456 --> 22:38.490
THEM IN AND OUT.

22:38.490 --> 22:39.224
THEN THE PROBLEM WAS HER

22:39.224 --> 22:39.691
HOSE.

22:39.691 --> 22:40.926
IT WAS, YOU KNOW, ALL WRAPPED

22:40.926 --> 22:43.061
UP, SO IT REALLY DIDN'T LOOK

22:43.061 --> 22:43.862
BAD.

22:43.862 --> 22:44.763
THEN IT WAS HER LAWN ART.

22:44.763 --> 22:46.598
YOU CAN'T HAVE THOSE.

22:46.598 --> 22:47.733
THEN THEY WANTED HER TO POWER

22:47.733 --> 22:48.967
WASH HER HOUSE AND SWEEP UP HER

22:48.967 --> 22:49.835
DRIVEWAY.

22:49.835 --> 22:51.803
BUT WHEN SHE DIDN'T GET IT DONE

22:51.803 --> 22:52.671
FAST ENOUGH, SHE GOT LATE FEES

22:52.671 --> 22:54.539
ON TOP OF LATE FEES, $25 A DAY

22:54.539 --> 22:56.341
FOR EACH INFRACTION.

22:56.341 --> 22:57.409
THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE SO

22:57.409 --> 22:58.376
INCIDENTAL, THEY'RE NOT

22:58.376 --> 22:59.311
IMPORTANT!

22:59.311 --> 23:00.879
THEY'RE ASININE.

23:00.879 --> 23:02.948
AND YOU'RE CHARGING ME $17,000

23:02.948 --> 23:04.483
DOLLARS?

23:04.483 --> 23:06.618
John: $17,000!

23:06.618 --> 23:13.125
THAT'S CLEARLY RIDICULOUS.

23:13.125 --> 23:13.725
I ADORE EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT

23:13.725 --> 23:17.095
WOMAN!

23:17.095 --> 23:17.729
INCLUDING HER WORLD-CLASS

23:17.729 --> 23:19.164
DELIVERY OF ASININE.

23:19.164 --> 23:19.831
ALTHOUGH, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH: I

23:19.831 --> 23:20.398
DO THINK SHE COULD DO BETTER

23:20.398 --> 23:21.299
WITH HER LAWN ART.

23:21.299 --> 23:21.900
IT'S NOT "$17,000 DOLLAR FINE"

23:21.900 --> 23:22.534
BAD, BUT IT'S CLEARLY A WASTE

23:22.534 --> 23:23.769
WHEN YOU COULD HAVE SOMETHING

23:23.769 --> 23:25.070
SPECTACULAR, LIKE THESE DUCKS

23:25.070 --> 23:26.972
WEARING BOOTS, OR THESE DUCKS

23:26.972 --> 23:28.340
MADE OF BANANAS.

23:28.340 --> 23:29.975
YOUR LAWN IS A CANVAS, PAT.

23:29.975 --> 23:31.243
FILL IT WITH WHATEVER DUCK ART

23:31.243 --> 23:33.845
SPEAKS TO YOU.

23:33.845 --> 23:35.514
THE POINT IS, THIS IS A SYSTEM

23:35.514 --> 23:36.982
THAT CAN QUICKLY TRAP PEOPLE IN

23:36.982 --> 23:39.417
A VICIOUS CYCLE OF DEBT.

23:39.417 --> 23:40.986
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS, LET'S SAY

23:40.986 --> 23:42.454
YOU FALL BEHIND ON HOA PAYMENTS.

23:42.454 --> 23:43.822
YOU MIGHT BE CHARGED INTEREST,

23:43.822 --> 23:44.990
AND HAVE TO PAY ADDITIONAL

23:44.990 --> 23:46.158
PENALTIES.

23:46.158 --> 23:47.592
BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING

23:47.592 --> 23:49.528
HERE, BECAUSE ONCE THE

23:49.528 --> 23:50.061
MANAGEMENT COMPANY STARTS

23:50.061 --> 23:51.196
PURSUING PAYMENT, THEY CAN

23:51.196 --> 23:53.098
INVOLVE LAWYERS, WHOSE FEES CAN

23:53.098 --> 23:54.499
BE ASTRONOMICAL, AND THINGS CAN

23:54.499 --> 23:55.801
GET OUT OF HAND FAST.

23:55.801 --> 23:57.602
HERE'S THE BILL OF JUST ONE

23:57.602 --> 23:59.371
88-YEAR-OLD HOMEOWNER IN TEXAS.

23:59.371 --> 24:00.739
SHE FELL ILL, AND WAS IN A

24:00.739 --> 24:02.774
NURSING HOME, SO SHE MISSED AN

24:02.774 --> 24:04.643
ANNUAL DUES PAYMENT AT THE START

24:04.643 --> 24:06.411
OF 2021, OF $423.

24:06.411 --> 24:08.079
HER HOA THEN STARTED CHARGING

24:08.079 --> 24:09.514
INTEREST AND FEES FOR MISSED

24:09.514 --> 24:10.448
PAYMENTS, AND JUST FIVE MONTHS

24:10.448 --> 24:11.049
LATER, HER BILL WAS ALREADY UP

24:11.049 --> 24:13.618
TO $682.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.520
BUT THINGS REALLY STARTED

24:15.520 --> 24:16.855
ESCALATING WHEN LAWYERS' FEES

24:16.855 --> 24:18.857
STARTED GETTING INTRODUCED.

24:18.857 --> 24:19.891
BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM.

24:19.891 --> 24:21.426
AND OVER THE COURSE OF JUST TWO

24:21.426 --> 24:24.729
YEARS, SHE SUDDENLY OWED OVER

24:24.729 --> 24:26.131
$8,000, WELL OVER HALF OF WHICH

24:26.131 --> 24:27.666
WAS LAWYERS' FEES.

24:27.666 --> 24:28.767
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHY

24:28.767 --> 24:29.634
LAWYERS ARE EVEN GETTING

24:29.634 --> 24:30.869
INVOLVED HERE, IT'S BECAUSE THEY

24:30.869 --> 24:32.804
OFTEN COME IN WHEN HOA'S ARE

24:32.804 --> 24:34.706
READY TO EXERCISE A TRULY

24:34.706 --> 24:35.640
INCREDIBLE POWER THEY HAVE OVER

24:35.640 --> 24:37.042
HOMEOWNERS, WHICH THIS WOMAN

24:37.042 --> 24:39.678
FOUND OUT ABOUT THE HARD WAY.

24:39.678 --> 24:40.612
THERE WAS A PROCESS SERVER

24:40.612 --> 24:42.447
WHO CAME AND KNOCKED ON MY DOOR

24:42.447 --> 24:43.548
AND SERVED ME WITH A FORECLOSURE

24:43.548 --> 24:45.016
NOTICE.

24:45.016 --> 24:45.917
AND OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, I

24:45.917 --> 24:47.485
FREAKED OUT.

24:47.485 --> 24:48.887
MIESHA HAD FALLEN BEHIND ON A

24:48.887 --> 24:49.988
LOT OF HER BILLS, BUT SHE SAID

24:49.988 --> 24:51.156
SHE'D WORK SOMETHING OUT WITH

24:51.156 --> 24:52.290
THE MORTGAGE COMPANY.

24:52.290 --> 24:53.725
BUT THIS WAS THE HOA, AND I

24:53.725 --> 24:54.926
HAD NO IDEA THAT AN HOA COULD

24:54.926 --> 24:56.461
FORECLOSE ON YOU.

24:56.461 --> 24:57.662
John: IT'S TRUE, HOA'S CAN

24:57.662 --> 25:00.332
FORECLOSE ON YOUR HOME.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.200
WHICH IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS

25:02.200 --> 25:03.001
THAT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS, BUT IS

25:03.001 --> 25:04.369
ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

25:04.369 --> 25:05.637
LIKE HOW THERE ARE FOUR TIMES AS

25:05.637 --> 25:07.239
MANY CHICKENS AS PEOPLE ON

25:07.239 --> 25:09.274
EARTH, OR LENNY KRAVITZ IS

25:09.274 --> 25:11.476
AL ROKER'S SECOND COUSIN, OR

25:11.476 --> 25:12.444
THAT THE FIRST SONG CHARLIE PUTH

25:12.444 --> 25:13.678
EVER MASTURBATED TO WAS

25:13.678 --> 25:15.146
"THIS LOVE" BY MAROON 5.

25:15.146 --> 25:16.248
THAT'S A TRUE FACT!

25:16.248 --> 25:18.283
AND I HATE THAT I KNOW IT!

25:18.283 --> 25:19.618
BUT I LOVE THAT YOU NOW KNOW IT,

25:19.618 --> 25:22.287
TOO.

25:22.287 --> 25:22.787
[LAUGHTER]

25:22.787 --> 25:23.421
AND THIS POWER GETS DEPLOYED ALL

25:23.421 --> 25:25.123
OVER THE COUNTRY.

25:25.123 --> 25:26.558
COLORADO'S HOA'S ALONE FILED

25:26.558 --> 25:29.094
MORE THAN 2400 FORECLOSURE CASES

25:29.094 --> 25:31.363
FROM JANUARY 2018 TO FEBRUARY OF

25:31.363 --> 25:32.597
LAST YEAR.

25:32.597 --> 25:34.165
AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THOSE

25:34.165 --> 25:35.967
HOMES CAN THEN BE SOLD AT

25:35.967 --> 25:37.502
AUCTION, SOMETIMES WITHOUT THE

25:37.502 --> 25:38.970
HOMEOWNER EVEN REALIZING.

25:38.970 --> 25:40.605
JUST LISTEN TO THIS WOMAN

25:40.605 --> 25:41.406
EXPLAIN HOW-- DESPITE

25:41.406 --> 25:44.976
DESPERATELY TRYING TO PAY LATE

25:44.976 --> 25:46.344
HOA FEES-- SHE WOUND UP LOSING

25:46.344 --> 25:46.945
EVERYTHING.

25:46.945 --> 25:47.512
WALKED IN, PAID OFF THE

25:47.512 --> 25:49.915
$2,700.

25:49.915 --> 25:52.584
AND WHEN I WALKED OUT, I SAID,

25:52.584 --> 25:53.118
"THIS IS ALL I OWE, RIGHT?"

25:53.118 --> 25:53.351
"YES."

25:53.351 --> 25:54.252
THEN HERE COMES THE NEXT SET OF

25:54.252 --> 25:54.886
LETTERS, AND NOW IT'S UP TO

25:54.886 --> 25:56.221
$6,400.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.689
TURNS OUT THERE WERE

25:57.689 --> 25:59.324
POST-JUDGMENT LEGAL FEES AND 18%

25:59.324 --> 26:00.258
BACK INTEREST.

26:00.258 --> 26:03.194
SO, EVEN AFTER SHE'D PAID MORE

26:03.194 --> 26:05.330
THAN $9,000, SHE WAS STILL

26:05.330 --> 26:06.564
SOMEHOW BEHIND ON HER DUES.

26:06.564 --> 26:09.768
BUT IN 2018, SHE RECEIVED THE

26:09.768 --> 26:12.203
MOST SHOCKING LETTER OF ALL.

26:12.203 --> 26:14.940
AN EVICTION NOTICE.

26:14.940 --> 26:16.241
YOU KNOW, YOU LOSE YOUR HOME.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.777
THAT'S HARD.

26:18.777 --> 26:20.245
BUT SADNESS TURNED TO ANGER

26:20.245 --> 26:21.746
WHEN SHE REALIZED THE HOA HAD

26:21.746 --> 26:22.681
PURCHASED HER HOME THROUGH

26:22.681 --> 26:27.352
FORECLOSURE FOR $3.24 A YEAR

26:27.352 --> 26:28.820
BEFORE SHE WAS EVICTED.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.922
John: THAT HAPPENED.

26:30.922 --> 26:31.990
THEY BOUGHT HER WHOLE HOUSE FOR

26:31.990 --> 26:33.792
$3.24.

26:33.792 --> 26:35.794
AND LOSING YOUR HOME ALONE IS

26:35.794 --> 26:37.095
HORRIFYING, BUT SEEING IT SOLD

26:37.095 --> 26:38.396
FOR SO LITTLE IS GENUINELY

26:38.396 --> 26:39.764
INSULTING.

26:39.764 --> 26:41.700
BECAUSE $3.24 IS SIGNIFICANTLY

26:41.700 --> 26:43.468
LESS THAN WHAT IT COSTS TO BUY

26:43.468 --> 26:47.238
JUST ONE OF THOSE BANANA DUCKS.

26:47.238 --> 26:48.773
THEY COST $17.98.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.241
AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS

26:50.241 --> 26:52.077
I BOUGHT ONE.

26:52.077 --> 26:52.677
AND YES, I, TOO, WAS SURPRISED

26:52.677 --> 26:55.547
BY HOW SMALL IT IS.

26:55.547 --> 26:57.048
BUT MUCH LESS SURPRISED THAN I

26:57.048 --> 26:58.383
WAS TO LEARN THAT IT TECHNICALLY

26:58.383 --> 26:59.818
COSTS MORE THAN SOMEONE'S ENTIRE

26:59.818 --> 27:02.087
FUCKING HOUSE.

27:02.087 --> 27:03.288
AND MOST STATES DON'T EVEN

27:03.288 --> 27:05.090
REQUIRE HOA'S TO OFFER A PAYMENT

27:05.090 --> 27:05.790
PLAN BEFORE TAKING LEGAL ACTION

27:05.790 --> 27:07.859
AGAINST A HOMEOWNER.

27:07.859 --> 27:08.626
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS

27:08.626 --> 27:09.060
SIMPLE.

27:09.060 --> 27:10.028
REMEMBER, HOA'S ARE PRIVATE

27:10.028 --> 27:12.130
ORGANIZATIONS.

27:12.130 --> 27:15.400
THAT MEANS THE NATION'S 350,000

27:15.400 --> 27:17.435
HOAS ARE LARGELY UNREGULATED.

27:17.435 --> 27:19.070
AND THE GOVERNMENT SEES ANY

27:19.070 --> 27:20.739
DISPUTES AS PRIVATE MATTERS.

27:20.739 --> 27:22.273
THE CALIFORNIA AG'S OFFICE SAYS

27:22.273 --> 27:23.575
THAT IT "DOES NOT HANDLE MOST

27:23.575 --> 27:24.576
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS

27:24.576 --> 27:26.578
COMPLAINTS," THE TEXAS SECRETARY

27:26.578 --> 27:29.814
OF STATE SAYS THAT "NO STATE

27:29.814 --> 27:30.915
AGENCY REGULATES HOME OR

27:30.915 --> 27:31.950
PROPERTY OWNERS' ASSOCIATIONS,"

27:31.950 --> 27:34.886
AND THE NEW YORK STATE AG SAYS

27:34.886 --> 27:36.121
"IN MOST CASES THERE IS NO

27:36.121 --> 27:38.156
GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT CAN HELP

27:38.156 --> 27:38.823
UNHAPPY HOME OWNERS WHO ARE

27:38.823 --> 27:41.626
HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THEIR

27:41.626 --> 27:42.761
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION," ADDING,

27:42.761 --> 27:43.461
"GOOD LUCK!"

27:43.461 --> 27:44.062
WHICH IS BASICALLY JUST A CUTE

27:44.062 --> 27:46.431
WAY TO SAY "YOU'RE FUCKED."

27:46.431 --> 27:48.566
IT'S LIKE "YOU'RE FUCKED" WASHED

27:48.566 --> 27:50.402
HER HAIR AND PUT ON A LITTLE

27:50.402 --> 27:51.436
CHURCH DRESS.

27:51.436 --> 27:52.170
AND IF AFTER ALL THIS YOU'RE

27:52.170 --> 27:54.572
THINKING, "WELL, I'VE LEARNED MY

27:54.572 --> 27:55.040
LESSON.

27:55.040 --> 27:55.807
I WILL NEVER BUY A HOUSE IN AN

27:55.807 --> 27:56.174
HOA."

27:56.174 --> 27:59.377
REMEMBER OVER 80% OF NEW HOMES

27:59.377 --> 28:02.113
THAT ARE SOLD, COME WITH ONE.

28:02.113 --> 28:02.747
ALSO, YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW YOU'RE

28:02.747 --> 28:04.416
DEALING WITH A BAD HOA UNTIL

28:04.416 --> 28:06.718
IT'S TOO LATE.

28:06.718 --> 28:07.285
AS IN MOST PLACES, YOU AREN'T

28:07.285 --> 28:09.120
LEGALLY REQUIRED TO BE GRANTED

28:09.120 --> 28:10.655
ACCESS TO ALL OF ITS RULES UNTIL

28:10.655 --> 28:12.223
AFTER YOUR OFFER TO BUY A HOME

28:12.223 --> 28:14.359
IS ACCEPTED.

28:14.359 --> 28:14.993
WHICH SEEMS A BIT WEIRD DOESN'T

28:14.993 --> 28:17.362
IT?

28:17.362 --> 28:19.998
IF YOUR HOA CAN SEE YOUR

28:19.998 --> 28:20.632
BACKYARD FROM SPACE, YOU SHOULD

28:20.632 --> 28:21.266
PROBABLY BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR HOA

28:21.266 --> 28:22.200
DOCUMENTS BEFORE YOU SIGN.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.568
AND LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING THAT

28:23.568 --> 28:25.503
ALL HOA'S SHOULD IMMEDIATELY BE

28:25.503 --> 28:26.805
GONE.

28:26.805 --> 28:30.608
FOR A START, SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE

28:30.608 --> 28:31.309

28:31.309 --> 28:32.477

28:32.477 --> 28:33.511
