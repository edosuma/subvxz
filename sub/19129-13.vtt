WEBVTT

00:01.869 --> 00:02.836
Previously, on "The Path"...

00:02.870 --> 00:04.772
I just need the files
for every disgruntled

00:04.805 --> 00:06.374
Meyerist who has ever left.

00:06.407 --> 00:08.776
Cal is in charge,
and he shouldn't be.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.444
What, are you collecting
Deniers now?

00:10.478 --> 00:13.081
We don't want to be Deniers.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.014
Special agent Gaines?

00:14.048 --> 00:15.359
They're the water results
you asked for.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.684
- How did this get in there?

00:16.717 --> 00:18.352
This is incredible.
It could be the same

00:18.386 --> 00:20.588
person who ran me off the road
last night.

00:20.621 --> 00:24.258
- Your mom told me that she had
a fight with your dad

00:24.292 --> 00:27.495
before she was chased off the
road, and he threatened her.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.563
- Are you thinking about
the outside world?

00:29.597 --> 00:31.599
Is there something else?
Someone?

00:31.632 --> 00:33.843
The man that you think might be
the father of your child?

00:33.867 --> 00:36.370
- Why are you here?
- My name isn't Sam.

00:36.404 --> 00:40.208
- So Sarah blackmailed the
people who came to her for help.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.376
- And if I bring them in
to testify,

00:42.410 --> 00:45.379
she's looking at four years
minimum sentence.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.348
- Cal, Sarah? They know.
- Richard, Felicia.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.183
- Are they safe?
- I don't know.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.285
- All I know is that it's over.
- I... I'm done.

00:51.319 --> 00:52.720
I just can't do this anymore.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.822
I'm sorry, Richard.
I really am.

00:54.855 --> 00:57.391
Cal is a false guardian.

00:57.425 --> 01:00.561
The Light has chosen Eddie Lane!

01:00.594 --> 01:04.532
- Richard? What are you doing?
- Sarah? Run!

02:29.717 --> 02:31.585
- Hey, Lizzie!

02:31.619 --> 02:33.321
- Hi, Ella.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.923
- We got to get to school,
girls.

02:35.956 --> 02:38.326
- Morning there.
- Morning.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.669
- How's everything
with the house?

02:39.693 --> 02:41.429
- Ah, it's great. Thank you.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.307
- You're so lucky
you don't have to go to school.

02:43.331 --> 02:45.933
- Oh, no, she has to
go to school, just homeschool.

02:45.966 --> 02:50.204
- We should get going too.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.440
- See you.

02:52.473 --> 02:59.413
*

03:13.394 --> 03:14.795
- All right, I'll see you soon.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.797
- Love you, Mommy.

03:16.830 --> 03:23.771
*

03:24.872 --> 03:26.907
Are we safe now?

03:26.940 --> 03:30.544
- Yeah.

03:36.750 --> 03:43.691
*

03:52.466 --> 03:54.702
Thank you for the gift
of this bread...

03:54.735 --> 03:58.306
To sustain these vessels
our bodies,

03:58.339 --> 04:00.574
so that we may have the energy
to create

04:00.608 --> 04:02.976
a more beautiful world,
and break through

04:03.010 --> 04:05.946
the blocks and barriers
of this life,

04:05.979 --> 04:09.617
and ascend The Ladder
of Enlightenment.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.360
- He's almost three weeks old,
and he still

05:16.384 --> 05:18.786
doesn't have a name.

05:18.819 --> 05:23.424
Did you want to call him Steve?

05:23.457 --> 05:24.858
- No.

05:24.892 --> 05:29.563
- Well, um, definitely not
my dad's name.

05:29.597 --> 05:34.034
- Well, the right name
will come.

05:36.103 --> 05:39.473
- Whose last name will he have?

05:42.510 --> 05:49.450
*

05:57.891 --> 06:01.094
- Are you and Daddy
back together again?

06:01.128 --> 06:04.732
- Daddy's just helping us.

06:04.765 --> 06:07.401
- I like you back together.

06:07.435 --> 06:14.374
*

06:45.539 --> 06:47.207
What are you doing?

06:47.240 --> 06:49.577
- I have to get this thing off.
- It itches.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.811
- Okay.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.713
We'll go to the doctor tomorrow.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.848
- I can't.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.918
I'll get caught.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.954
I don't care about me, but

07:00.988 --> 07:02.823
Summer...

07:08.896 --> 07:10.764
I did it for The Movement.

07:10.798 --> 07:15.469
All those people had done
horrible things.

07:15.503 --> 07:19.106
I know I was wrong.

07:19.139 --> 07:23.511
What I did was awful, and I'm
gonna have to live with it.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.913
That and for what happened
to Richard.

07:25.946 --> 07:29.049
- What happened to Richard
is not your fault.

07:29.082 --> 07:34.121
- What will happen to him?
- His soul?

07:34.154 --> 07:35.789
- I don't know.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.190
- How can you not know?

07:37.224 --> 07:41.695
You're supposed to be imbued
with The Light.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.906
So let me get this straight.

07:52.940 --> 07:56.076
A friend of yours at the FBI
told you

07:56.109 --> 07:59.813
that my blackmail victims
had been deposed?

07:59.847 --> 08:01.081
- Yeah.

08:01.114 --> 08:04.217
- Who is this magical friend?

08:08.989 --> 08:12.760
You know, you don't have to stay
with us.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.695
We'll be fine.

08:14.728 --> 08:18.265
- I know.

08:21.334 --> 08:25.038
Here.

08:25.072 --> 08:28.642
- Why are you doing this for me?

08:28.676 --> 08:32.212
- Because you're still
the mother of my children.

08:34.181 --> 08:37.818
Meyerists view death
as a celebration.

08:37.851 --> 08:42.590
A celebration of a life lived,

08:42.623 --> 08:45.759
and the promise of The Garden.

08:45.793 --> 08:50.664
But in this case,
there's no joy,

08:50.698 --> 08:54.134
only anger and sorrow.

08:56.804 --> 08:59.907
Many of you suggested we not
gather for Richard's passing,

08:59.940 --> 09:02.209
but he... he was with us
for a long time,

09:02.242 --> 09:04.344
and loved.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.914
He was, uh...

09:06.947 --> 09:10.217
he was loved by many of us.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.923
Um...

09:15.956 --> 09:19.059
My hope...
is that we can use today

09:19.092 --> 09:22.730
to transform

09:22.763 --> 09:25.766
the agony of this brutal loss

09:25.799 --> 09:27.868
into something, uh...

09:27.901 --> 09:30.671
Into some gain.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.774
Thank you, Bill and Felicia,
for standing by our side

09:33.807 --> 09:37.077
at such a difficult time.

09:40.113 --> 09:47.054
*

10:10.878 --> 10:13.413
- Things will be set right.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.415
- You'll say something
at Ascension Day?

10:15.448 --> 10:17.317
- Hasn't there been
enough damage?

10:17.350 --> 10:20.788
- Cal doesn't want
any more either.

10:20.821 --> 10:24.091
He's good for The Movement.

10:24.124 --> 10:29.429
Oh.
He's beautiful. Oh.

10:29.462 --> 10:35.068
- Thank you.
- I should get him home.

10:35.102 --> 10:38.071
- No way that baby is Sean's.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.840
What are they saying
at the city center?

10:39.873 --> 10:41.317
- Everyone's wondering
the same thing.

10:41.341 --> 10:45.779
- Huh.
- Whose baby is it?

10:45.813 --> 10:47.915
- Let's get you home.
- Yeah. Okay.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.017
Stay strong.
I'm here for you.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.986
This is very painful for me too.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.822
You know how much
I love your mother.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.390
All right...

10:57.424 --> 10:59.960
We're gonna fight these horrible
lies against her.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.995
- Okay?
- You okay?

11:02.029 --> 11:05.165
- You take care of him.
- All right?

11:05.198 --> 11:07.234
Okay, excuse me.
Hey, Russ?

11:07.267 --> 11:09.770
- Yeah.
- Talk for a sec?

11:09.803 --> 11:11.705
Hi, Nicole.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.473
Ah...

11:13.506 --> 11:15.175
Any sign of Eddie?

11:15.208 --> 11:16.810
- I dropped by there
the other day,

11:16.844 --> 11:18.722
saw a couple people going
in and out of his place.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.881
- What people?

11:20.914 --> 11:24.317
- Well, can we find out?
- Mm-hmm.

11:24.351 --> 11:28.221
You don't think
Eddie's with Sarah?

11:36.296 --> 11:43.236
*

12:20.841 --> 12:23.110
- You're good.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.345
*

12:25.378 --> 12:28.048
Move it up.

12:28.081 --> 12:35.022
*

12:58.946 --> 13:01.414
- Ah, wow. Check this out.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.084
Ah.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.420
- It's so beautiful.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.322
- Here.

13:09.356 --> 13:12.092
Hey, Summer, um, so,
I have something to tell you.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.027
I just think that your...

13:17.630 --> 13:20.868
All right, so I put a message
inside of this for you,

13:20.901 --> 13:22.369
and anytime you want to hear it,

13:22.402 --> 13:24.437
just put it up to your ear,

13:24.471 --> 13:26.573
and you will hear me.

13:26.606 --> 13:29.042
It's cool, right?

13:29.076 --> 13:31.378
- Mm-hmm.

13:31.411 --> 13:37.985
*

13:41.588 --> 13:43.556
Hi.

13:43.590 --> 13:51.431
*

13:51.464 --> 13:55.268
I'm hungry.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.603
Hungry?

13:56.636 --> 13:58.338
All right, let's go
grab some lunch.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.440
- I'm buying.
- Oh.

14:00.473 --> 14:03.076
Wow.

14:03.110 --> 14:05.012
*

14:05.045 --> 14:06.613
Can we get ice cream?

14:06.646 --> 14:08.448
Yeah, if your mom's
still buying.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.583
I did make some good
tips this week.

14:10.617 --> 14:13.386
- We can get a sundae.
- Ah, sundae.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.554
That sounds so good.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.323
What kind of sundae do you want?

14:16.356 --> 14:17.991
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

14:18.025 --> 14:19.635
- Just any kind of sundae?
- I don't know. Yeah.

14:19.659 --> 14:22.662
- I like that.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.364
- You know what? Um...
- What?

14:24.397 --> 14:25.909
- Here, go back to the truck.
- Go home.

14:25.933 --> 14:29.036
- What?
- Uh, my FBI friend is here.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.603
Look, I don't know
what side he's on.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.306
Just go home, and
I'll let you know

14:33.340 --> 14:36.576
if you have to move again.

14:39.646 --> 14:43.416
Go.

14:46.486 --> 14:49.189
Hey. What are you doing here?

14:49.222 --> 14:51.558
- Now, see, that's funny.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.593
You tell me to do
the right thing,

14:53.626 --> 14:55.628
and then you run off
with my case.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.497
- Sarah isn't here with me.

14:57.530 --> 15:00.934
- Eddie, I tell you
a judge approved

15:00.968 --> 15:03.703
a warrant for your ex-wife,

15:03.736 --> 15:06.206
then you two disappear,
and your car crosses

15:06.239 --> 15:07.307
the border that night.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.942
Come on, man. I'm FBI.

15:08.976 --> 15:12.045
- Well, she's not here.
- Just me.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.447
- Now, you know I don't believe
a word you're saying.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.349
- Look, I don't know
what to tell you,

15:16.383 --> 15:18.318
Sam...

15:18.351 --> 15:20.520
Abe...

15:20.553 --> 15:22.555
But that's the truth.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.358
- Hmm.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.735
Well, I guess that's
good luck for me,

15:26.759 --> 15:28.095
because I'm not here for Sarah.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.663
I'm here for you, Eddie.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.332
You're needed.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.134
Your people are waiting for you,

15:34.167 --> 15:38.005
and I'm here to bring you back.

15:41.041 --> 15:47.981
*

16:09.536 --> 16:10.703
Unburden.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.339
What's on your mind?

16:12.372 --> 16:14.307
Your mom, your dad?

16:16.109 --> 16:19.612
I don't even know
what to say anymore.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.382
What if she really did blackmail
all those people?

16:22.415 --> 16:26.419
And... I mean, Cal is so
protective of her,

16:26.453 --> 16:28.721
he just has everyone
convinced that

16:28.755 --> 16:31.624
she's being persecuted.

16:33.226 --> 16:37.197
Wish I could divorce
both my parents.

16:37.230 --> 16:40.467
- You know what I've learned?

16:40.500 --> 16:43.536
You don't have to stick with
the family you were born into.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.172
We can make a new one.

16:45.205 --> 16:48.208
And you have Cal, who loves you
like a father.

16:48.241 --> 16:51.811
You have me, if you want me.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.646
- Yeah.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.716
I want you.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.823
Oh, uh, sorry.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.425
- Oh. It's fine.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.759
This came for you in the mail.

17:06.792 --> 17:10.163
- Thank you.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.502
- "Do something with it."

17:16.536 --> 17:19.172
What is "It"?

17:19.205 --> 17:21.407
- It's from my mom.

17:21.441 --> 17:25.377
These are the Clarksville
water results.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.753
All right, man.

17:33.786 --> 17:37.690
I'll let you do your thing.

17:37.724 --> 17:41.661
Don't fuck with my case anymore.

17:43.496 --> 17:47.800
- Why are you still in
all of this, anyway?

17:47.834 --> 17:51.104
Running after me,
bringing me back?

17:51.138 --> 17:53.740
- I don't know.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.509
- Yes, you do.
- It got to you.

17:56.543 --> 17:59.379
- Yeah, maybe.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.281
But my moral compass is all off,

18:01.314 --> 18:04.617
and I need to get it
back on track.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.854
- Go home and deal with it.

18:07.887 --> 18:12.192
- You know, I've, uh...

18:12.225 --> 18:15.795
Eddie, I've done things.

18:15.828 --> 18:20.367
I've been with someone else.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.203
Yeah.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.472
How do I not tell my wife?

18:25.505 --> 18:29.609
And if I do,
how does she forgive me?

18:29.642 --> 18:32.745
Maybe you can't go back.

18:35.815 --> 18:39.452
- Maybe.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.290
Or maybe you miss out on
the best thing

18:43.323 --> 18:47.427
that's ever happened to you.

18:54.567 --> 18:57.270
Well, I got to take care of
some things first.

18:57.304 --> 19:01.641
I screwed someone else over,
and it is eating me up.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.876
- Anything I can do?
- You know, I'll...

19:03.910 --> 19:05.945
I'll let you know.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.647
Listen, man. Go ahead.
Go inside.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.848
They're waiting for you.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.817
Okay.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.820
- Hey.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.857
- Hey.
- God, I missed this.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.326
- Uh...
- Meadow told me.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.863
The Light chose you.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.931
- Wow, I, uh...

19:58.965 --> 20:00.833
I don't know what to say.

20:00.867 --> 20:06.339
Um, you know, I'm humbled
that you're all here.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.441
Look, the, uh, thing is,

20:08.475 --> 20:11.711
I was told that I had to finish
the climb

20:11.744 --> 20:13.980
before I...

20:14.013 --> 20:18.751
And now that seems impossible.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.292
You know, I... I've always been
able to...

20:25.325 --> 20:26.926
To see things.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.529
You know, visions.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.565
But I have no control
over when or how

20:32.599 --> 20:34.033
I see them.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.602
Like, I don't know
what happens next,

20:35.635 --> 20:39.739
or how all of this
is going to end.

20:41.874 --> 20:45.578
I guess why I'm telling
you all this

20:45.612 --> 20:48.281
is because...

20:48.315 --> 20:50.650
like, I don't know
if I'm "the one."

20:50.683 --> 20:53.420
I know Steve has asked me
to lead,

20:53.453 --> 20:55.922
but I just... you know, I just...
I don't know.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.957
- Eddie.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.627
Eddie, we're with you.

21:00.660 --> 21:05.832
- We're waiting for you to tell
us what to do next.

21:05.865 --> 21:08.601
- Okay.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.572
We've contacted the Mounties.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.407
Gave 'em a description
of Sarah Lane,

21:14.441 --> 21:16.008
traveling with a ten-year-old.

21:16.042 --> 21:19.412
- That's great.
- What's up?

21:19.446 --> 21:22.482
- I just don't get how people
can disappear anymore.

21:22.515 --> 21:25.818
Chuck your
iPhone, you're invisible.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.554
Hmm.

21:27.587 --> 21:30.623
This girl from Wisconsin,
both of her parents died

21:30.657 --> 21:33.626
in a freak car accident,
so she goes to the big city,

21:33.660 --> 21:35.362
gets arrested for prostitution,

21:35.395 --> 21:37.564
some predator picks her up
off the street,

21:37.597 --> 21:39.499
uses her.

21:39.532 --> 21:42.068
She gets out of jail, and flees.

21:42.101 --> 21:43.470
Guess where she goes.

21:43.503 --> 21:44.737
- Canada?

21:44.771 --> 21:46.339
- Hmm. No.

21:46.373 --> 21:47.740
Meyerist Movement.

21:47.774 --> 21:50.877
- Who are you talking about?

21:52.945 --> 21:56.483
Looking for her right there.

21:56.516 --> 21:59.519
I don't understand.
How did my mom get these?

21:59.552 --> 22:02.589
- The police found them in her
car after the accident.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.023
- This is amazing,
to be a part of

22:04.056 --> 22:06.593
being able to blow
this thing up?

22:06.626 --> 22:08.027
- Yes, it is.
- Wait.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.397
Is this why someone tried
to run her off the road?

22:10.430 --> 22:12.499
- 'Cause you said my dad...
- No, I said

22:12.532 --> 22:15.101
your mom had a fight with him
before she went off the road.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.837
- No, you pretty clearly
insinuated that...

22:17.870 --> 22:21.641
- We don't know who ran
your mother off the road.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.477
Got a minute?

22:24.511 --> 22:26.613
- Yeah, yeah, um...

22:26.646 --> 22:29.549
Yeah, give me a second.

22:31.618 --> 22:34.721
Your... your dad's caused your mom
a lot of pain.

22:34.754 --> 22:38.825
All right?
I've seen it up close.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.566
- He's right.

22:46.599 --> 22:50.603
I mean, your dad has been
nothing but heartbreak.

22:53.640 --> 23:01.047
* *

23:01.080 --> 23:02.749
- Eddie came back today.

23:02.782 --> 23:05.785
Guess whose car he got out of.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.086
Sam.

23:07.119 --> 23:09.722
- Sam Field?

23:09.756 --> 23:13.793
- His house is full of Deniers.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.162
- Hey.

23:16.195 --> 23:19.165
- People from the compound.
- Meadow Stamberg.

23:19.198 --> 23:22.068
Phil Kenswick. Betsy Singer.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.571
You remember Betsy?

23:24.604 --> 23:27.039
- Well, what are they
doing there?

23:27.073 --> 23:30.910
- They want to reform
The Movement.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.912
- Hmm.

23:35.615 --> 23:38.851
Okay. Okay. Thank you.

23:38.885 --> 23:45.825
*

24:02.542 --> 24:04.644
- Is it true
what they're saying?

24:04.677 --> 24:06.112
- What are they saying?

24:06.145 --> 24:08.815
- That Richard's lies
are getting to people.

24:08.848 --> 24:11.784
They're joining Eddie Lane.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.126
Hey.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.962
Five or six people.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.864
We have thousands of members.

24:24.897 --> 24:26.933
- I hear the rumors,
and people are listening.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.535
- Well, what are they saying?

24:32.572 --> 24:35.107
- That he's the one who's
supposed to build The Garden.

24:35.141 --> 24:36.843
And that he will make
The Movement

24:36.876 --> 24:41.013
- what we want it to be...
- That's nonsense.

24:41.047 --> 24:43.149
People don't know
what they want.

24:49.622 --> 24:51.824
- I am one of the people,

24:51.858 --> 24:55.061
so I do kinda know.

24:55.094 --> 24:58.631
We want the Wizard to be real.

24:58.665 --> 25:01.668
We want to believe that
the sad, angry boy

25:01.701 --> 25:03.703
can become the King.

25:03.736 --> 25:08.007
And that he will understand us,
because he once was us.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.976
- You talking about Eddie?

25:10.009 --> 25:13.846
- I'm talking about you.

25:13.880 --> 25:17.617
This place would not have
survived without you.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.218
The Movement is yours.

25:19.251 --> 25:21.053
It's not Steve's, not Sarah's...

25:21.087 --> 25:22.755
- She's not the problem here.

25:22.789 --> 25:25.892
- She blackmailed people, and
she will go to jail.

25:25.925 --> 25:30.129
You are what we want,
what we need,

25:30.162 --> 25:33.265
and you should be standing
before us on Ascension Day.

25:33.299 --> 25:37.236
But you need to do
something about Eddie.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.347
*

25:48.380 --> 25:52.018
- Cal?

25:52.051 --> 25:58.991
*

26:07.767 --> 26:11.303
- What are we gonna do, Eddie?

26:11.337 --> 26:13.172
- That ship has sailed, Cal.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.877
Why? Do you have a plan?

26:17.910 --> 26:20.179
- What do you want?

26:20.212 --> 26:23.149
- Do you think
you can lead people?

26:23.182 --> 26:26.686
Are you ready to take on their...

26:26.719 --> 26:29.789
Their hopes, their dreams,
their agony?

26:29.822 --> 26:32.925
- I'll do my best.

26:32.959 --> 26:37.196
- It's easy to tell, uh,
nine people

26:37.229 --> 26:38.965
you'll take care of them.

26:38.998 --> 26:41.801
What about 50?

26:41.834 --> 26:43.770
100? 1,000?

26:43.803 --> 26:45.104
You know, it changes you.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.974
Look at Sarah.

26:48.007 --> 26:50.176
You'll do whatever it takes

26:50.209 --> 26:55.014
to fend for them.

26:55.047 --> 26:57.917
The business of running
a religion changes you.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.052
- It's not a business.

27:00.086 --> 27:03.790
- Yeah, it is.

27:03.823 --> 27:06.325
I'm doing you a favor right now.

27:06.358 --> 27:09.028
- Really?
- Because you don't want

27:09.061 --> 27:11.430
what comes next.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.033
Pack up your Merry Men,

27:14.066 --> 27:15.968
before you thoroughly

27:16.002 --> 27:18.905
fuck up their lives

27:18.938 --> 27:22.274
and your own.

27:22.308 --> 27:25.077
- There's not a single thing

27:25.111 --> 27:29.982
that you can do or say

27:30.016 --> 27:34.086
to get me to walk
away from this.

27:34.120 --> 27:38.357
Get the fuck out of here.

27:39.458 --> 27:42.394
What about Sarah?

27:42.428 --> 27:45.297
What if you could help her?

27:45.331 --> 27:49.235
What if... what if we could?

27:49.268 --> 27:56.208
*

28:14.060 --> 28:21.000
*

28:28.240 --> 28:30.209
- Hello. Welcome.

28:30.242 --> 28:32.879
Come in.
The girls are so excited.

28:32.912 --> 28:34.446
So glad you could
come to dinner.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.282
- Thanks so much for having us.

28:36.315 --> 28:39.151
- I got a roast in the kitchen.
- Just needs a little more time.

28:39.185 --> 28:42.288
- Um, I sorry, I... we...
- We don't really eat meat.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.366
- I should have said something.
- You're vegetarians?

28:44.390 --> 28:46.793
- Yes, but we're... we're happy
with anything else.

28:46.826 --> 28:48.895
- Oh, gosh, I feel terrible.

28:48.928 --> 28:52.064
- You do the homeschool too.

28:52.098 --> 28:53.933
What does that make you?

28:53.966 --> 28:56.803
- Uh, weird, I guess.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.113
- Well, tell me you
at least drink.

28:58.137 --> 28:59.438
- I do like my wine.

28:59.471 --> 29:01.273
- Red or white?
- Red.

29:01.307 --> 29:06.012
Thank you.

29:06.045 --> 29:07.413
- Cast came off.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.048
- Yeah.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.382
- You take it off yourself?

29:10.416 --> 29:14.053
I noticed it in the trash.

29:14.086 --> 29:17.056
- It was itching, so...

29:17.089 --> 29:18.925
- American, eh?

29:18.958 --> 29:21.760
- Yes.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.431
- I hunt.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.199
Um, you look nervous.

29:27.233 --> 29:32.404
- Um, guns around kids
make me nervous.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.373
- Now, I tried Googling you.

29:34.406 --> 29:35.474
Paula Benson.

29:35.507 --> 29:38.077
And, uh, I couldn't find you.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.179
- Well, there's a lot of people
you can't Google.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.048
- Here's your wine.
- Thank you.

29:42.081 --> 29:43.859
- Roast is just about ready.
- Uh, do you mind

29:43.883 --> 29:45.323
telling me where
the ladies' room is?

29:45.351 --> 29:46.853
Sure.
It's right through there.

29:46.886 --> 29:49.488
- Excuse me.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.292
Hey, Lizzie?

29:53.325 --> 29:57.964
Uh, why don't we wash up
for dinner, huh?

30:05.637 --> 30:07.539
All right. Look at me.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.977
We have to leave.
Do what I say.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.511
Don't be scared, okay?

30:12.544 --> 30:14.246
Okay.

30:16.949 --> 30:19.018
Okay.

30:19.051 --> 30:22.321
Watch your head.

30:22.354 --> 30:24.023
It's okay.

30:24.056 --> 30:25.391
Go.

30:25.424 --> 30:32.364
*

30:33.465 --> 30:35.167
Go.

30:35.201 --> 30:42.141
*

30:47.246 --> 30:49.281
All right. Go to the car.

30:49.315 --> 30:52.518
- Wait!
- Wait, Summer.

30:52.551 --> 30:54.386
Come on.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.355
Come on, let's go.
Hurry.

30:56.388 --> 30:59.058
*

30:59.091 --> 31:02.328
- You guys okay in there?

31:02.361 --> 31:05.031
- Call 911.

31:05.064 --> 31:09.101
*

31:09.135 --> 31:11.938
- Okay.

31:11.971 --> 31:13.305
All right, get in there.

31:13.339 --> 31:14.673
Go.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.408
It's all right.

31:16.442 --> 31:19.611
*

31:19.645 --> 31:21.147
Okay.

31:24.416 --> 31:31.357
*

31:48.007 --> 31:50.076
- Gosh, you're so talented.
- Oh, thank you.

31:50.109 --> 31:52.120
- I don't know how you do it.
- I don't... I don't know how it...

31:52.144 --> 31:53.984
- It was the weirdest thing.
- It's incredible.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.514
- They're all in Cal's office.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.516
- Eddie Lane is there?

31:57.549 --> 31:59.918
- Just a second.

32:01.988 --> 32:03.689
What about Eddie Lane?

32:03.722 --> 32:07.593
- He's here.
- In Cal's office.

32:20.039 --> 32:23.209
- What's going on?
- Hello, Hawk.

32:23.242 --> 32:24.543
It seems as if your life

32:24.576 --> 32:28.080
is about as complicated
as my son's.

32:30.149 --> 32:34.286
- What is this?
- It's just, uh, business.

32:34.320 --> 32:39.491
- Now, one of you tell me
what's going on.

32:39.525 --> 32:43.729
- It's complicated, kid.
- Dad.

32:43.762 --> 32:47.766
- Bye, Eddie.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.036
- Cal, please...
- I think it's best

32:50.069 --> 32:53.105
if your dad explained
this one to you.

32:56.142 --> 33:03.082
*

33:13.525 --> 33:15.561
Right there's good.

33:22.101 --> 33:24.070
Hey.

33:24.103 --> 33:25.271
You're back at work?

33:25.304 --> 33:27.739
- Yeah.

33:27.773 --> 33:30.142
- Where's the, uh, the baby?

33:30.176 --> 33:32.244
- The nursery here is great,
and I can stop by

33:32.278 --> 33:35.314
every two hours to feed him.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.449
Don't be so old-fashioned.

33:37.483 --> 33:38.817
I love to work.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.820
Makes me a better mother.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.656
- Hmm.

33:45.724 --> 33:48.194
- Why was Eddie here?

33:48.227 --> 33:49.228
- We had some business.

33:49.261 --> 33:52.731
- What kind?

33:52.764 --> 33:54.400
Sorry.

33:54.433 --> 33:58.637
I like to hear about your life.

34:00.706 --> 34:03.642
- I, uh...

34:04.710 --> 34:06.712
I helped him to see that

34:06.745 --> 34:11.117
he... he doesn't have
what it takes.

34:11.150 --> 34:14.320
He was willing to

34:14.353 --> 34:16.155
completely abandon his...

34:16.188 --> 34:18.524
His... his... whatever he's doing

34:18.556 --> 34:22.494
in an instant

34:22.527 --> 34:25.531
to help Sarah.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.366
- And you trust him?

34:27.399 --> 34:29.435
- Hmm?
- To abandon it.

34:29.467 --> 34:32.204
- You can't start
a reform movement

34:32.237 --> 34:36.442
with a corrupt foundation.

34:36.475 --> 34:38.577
- Why'd you really help Sarah?

34:38.610 --> 34:40.279
- Excuse me?

34:40.312 --> 34:41.880
- She's not your lover anymore.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.216
And Hawk is not your son.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.118
You have your own son now.

34:46.152 --> 34:48.719
We have a son.

34:48.754 --> 34:51.357
And you should let him
and everyone know.

34:51.389 --> 34:52.791
They'll respect you for it.

34:52.824 --> 34:56.527
- Now, don't be so
fucking presumptuous.

34:56.562 --> 35:03.502
*

35:10.942 --> 35:14.280
- I'm trying to get this
cleaned up.

35:14.313 --> 35:16.715
Okay.

35:16.748 --> 35:19.518
- Ah!

35:19.551 --> 35:22.254
- Can't believe
it's fall already.

35:22.288 --> 35:23.755
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.391
- How's the baby?
- Great.

35:25.424 --> 35:27.893
- Have a name yet?
- No.

35:27.926 --> 35:31.397
Hey, um, I don't know if you're
talking to your mom,

35:31.430 --> 35:34.666
but if you do, will you tell her
I'm sorry?

35:34.700 --> 35:36.268
- For what?

35:36.302 --> 35:38.304
- I should have told her

35:38.337 --> 35:42.174
who the father of the baby was.

35:42.208 --> 35:44.443
- Who's the father?

35:44.476 --> 35:45.844
- Can you keep a secret?

35:45.877 --> 35:50.349
- We don't really have secrets.

35:50.382 --> 35:52.918
Yes.

35:58.657 --> 36:05.597
*

36:19.478 --> 36:21.380
Stop right there.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.682
Pop the trunk, please.

36:23.715 --> 36:26.852
*

36:26.885 --> 36:28.687
All right, next.
Move it forward.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.456
*

36:30.489 --> 36:32.424
Whoa, whoa. Right there.

36:32.458 --> 36:35.827
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you heading today?

36:35.861 --> 36:37.329
Yeah, copy that.

36:37.363 --> 36:39.265
Jim, we got this
late-model sedan.

36:39.298 --> 36:42.501
Coming over to you now.

36:42.534 --> 36:45.837
- You remember everything
I told you?

36:45.871 --> 36:48.340
When this man takes me away?

36:48.374 --> 36:51.943
- Grandma and Grandpa are
waiting for me over the border.

36:51.977 --> 36:53.345
- That's right.

36:53.379 --> 36:55.881
Liquids, seeds, animal products.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.450
*

36:58.484 --> 37:01.553
Okay, just pull right up
to that window.

37:01.587 --> 37:03.422
Next.

37:03.455 --> 37:10.396
*

37:12.364 --> 37:14.733
- Morning, ma'am.
- Passports, please.

37:14.766 --> 37:19.771
*

37:19.805 --> 37:22.974
- I'm scared.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.943
- Don't be.

37:24.976 --> 37:28.714
Okay?

37:28.747 --> 37:30.682
I love you.

37:30.716 --> 37:35.921
And I want you to see your mom
do the right thing.

37:35.954 --> 37:38.657
I want you to be proud of me.

37:38.690 --> 37:45.631
*

37:48.434 --> 37:50.402
- Mrs. Lane?

37:50.436 --> 37:51.637
You can go on through.

37:51.670 --> 37:55.407
Have a nice day now.

38:14.426 --> 38:17.696
Hey, Dad.

38:17.729 --> 38:20.732
- Hey.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.669
Hey.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.404
Um, hey, could you guys, uh,

38:25.437 --> 38:27.373
- just give is a minute...
- Sure.

38:27.406 --> 38:30.008
- Please?

38:30.041 --> 38:32.978
Thanks.

38:34.413 --> 38:36.582
- Planting a garden?

38:36.615 --> 38:39.385
- Uh, yeah.

38:39.418 --> 38:42.087
Uh, broccoli, kale...

38:42.120 --> 38:44.656
- Is it true?

38:44.690 --> 38:46.057
What Richard said about you?

38:46.091 --> 38:50.128
What they're all
saying about you?

38:50.161 --> 38:53.965
- Steve asked me to guide
The Movement.

38:57.002 --> 39:00.706
So, uh, my mom's a criminal,

39:00.739 --> 39:03.642
and Cal's not the man
I thought he was,

39:03.675 --> 39:07.479
and my dad is...

39:07.513 --> 39:08.914
magic?

39:08.947 --> 39:12.851
- I'm not magic.
- Well, you're something.

39:12.884 --> 39:15.621
Look, I believe in magic.
I floated.

39:15.654 --> 39:19.391
Okay, just...

39:19.425 --> 39:22.761
Just make me feel like the
people inside your house feel.

39:22.794 --> 39:24.563
- I wish I could.

39:24.596 --> 39:29.034
- I'm asking you to help me
believe in you.

39:29.067 --> 39:32.804
- It doesn't work that way.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.608
Why...

39:36.642 --> 39:40.846
Why were you and Cal
with Libby DeKaan?

39:44.916 --> 39:47.586
- We got her to pay back

39:47.619 --> 39:49.588
the people your mother
blackmailed,

39:49.621 --> 39:51.523
to get them to drop the charges.

39:51.557 --> 39:53.725
- So...

39:53.759 --> 39:55.761
Nothing's gonna happen
with the water tests?

39:55.794 --> 39:59.498
And Mom's not gonna...

39:59.531 --> 40:00.866
- Go to jail.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.601
- Why...

40:02.634 --> 40:04.102
I mean, after she and Cal, why...

40:04.135 --> 40:09.040
Why would you care about her
like that?

40:12.110 --> 40:15.814
And why did Cal need you there
to trade with Libby DeKaan?

40:15.847 --> 40:19.785
He could have just
done it on his own.

40:22.654 --> 40:25.991
- Cal tested me,

40:26.024 --> 40:31.563
and I'm not the one.

40:31.597 --> 40:33.632
Okay? I'm not...

40:33.665 --> 40:37.936
the guy to lead anyone.

40:39.505 --> 40:44.543
- The people inside
think you are.

40:44.576 --> 40:46.878
What do you think?

40:46.912 --> 40:48.847
Dad? What...

40:48.880 --> 40:51.116
Do you believe it?

40:54.152 --> 40:55.754
*

41:02.994 --> 41:08.734
*

41:08.767 --> 41:11.002
- Loss.

41:11.036 --> 41:13.038
What is this...

41:13.071 --> 41:16.241
overwhelming feeling?

41:16.274 --> 41:18.076
Debilitating...

41:18.109 --> 41:20.178
Loss.
What is this...

41:20.211 --> 41:21.880
This, uh...

41:21.913 --> 41:26.017
What is... what is this
overwhelming feeling?

41:26.051 --> 41:28.520
- Mercy.

41:28.554 --> 41:30.622
The act of compassion
that we hold

41:30.656 --> 41:34.159
like power in our hands.

41:34.192 --> 41:38.163
Loss washes over us

41:38.196 --> 41:40.699
and takes us under.

41:40.732 --> 41:44.536
Does it matter who drowns?

41:44.570 --> 41:46.538
Yeah, you know?

41:46.572 --> 41:49.240
How do you find compassion

41:49.274 --> 41:53.278
for all the people
you don't even know?

41:53.311 --> 41:56.748
And serve... serve lives

41:56.782 --> 42:01.553
you'd never intersect with?

42:01.587 --> 42:04.790
And make them matter.

42:07.826 --> 42:14.766
*

42:17.102 --> 42:20.872
And let go...

42:20.906 --> 42:23.141
of the loss

42:23.174 --> 42:27.813
so that we can embrace...

42:29.280 --> 42:33.919
So that you can embrace
what's new.

42:36.755 --> 42:41.326
How do we show mercy?

42:41.359 --> 42:46.732
When the one we're dying
for forgiveness from

42:46.765 --> 42:49.768
is ourself?

42:49.801 --> 42:56.742
*

43:17.128 --> 43:19.064
- Hey.

43:39.284 --> 43:41.086
- Forest.

43:43.454 --> 43:46.091
Because, um,

43:46.124 --> 43:48.660
that's where he was born.

43:48.694 --> 43:50.295
Hmm?

43:50.328 --> 43:53.331
And came out into the world.

43:53.364 --> 43:56.301
Yeah.

43:57.836 --> 44:02.440
Forest Roberts.

44:02.473 --> 44:06.277
Doesn't sound too bad, huh?

44:23.361 --> 44:27.132
Why?

44:27.165 --> 44:29.100
- Why did you do it?

44:29.134 --> 44:31.169
- Hawk told you.
- It was my crime.

44:31.202 --> 44:35.006
And if I wanted to pay for it,
I should have been able to.

44:35.040 --> 44:37.175
- Yeah, well, I couldn't
let you go to jail.

44:37.208 --> 44:41.312
- You could have helped
an entire community.

44:41.346 --> 44:43.281
- I know. Believe me.

44:43.314 --> 44:45.984
- Why? Why, Eddie?

44:46.017 --> 44:47.318
Why couldn't you let me

44:47.352 --> 44:50.321
take responsibility
for my own actions?

44:50.355 --> 44:52.457
- If you want to be punished,

44:52.490 --> 44:54.259
you will be, okay?

44:54.292 --> 44:56.261
You don't have to go out
searching for it.

44:56.294 --> 45:00.966
Your life will be hell.

45:02.033 --> 45:05.470
- Let's go.

45:05.503 --> 45:07.172
- Walk away together.
- Sarah...

45:07.205 --> 45:08.807
Be a family.

45:08.840 --> 45:11.910
It's what you wanted.

45:11.943 --> 45:14.445
I mean, Canada? Anywhere.

45:14.479 --> 45:17.215
We were happy.
We were almost happy, Eddie.

45:17.248 --> 45:19.217
- We could be happy.
- Sarah...

45:19.250 --> 45:20.819
- Please.

45:20.852 --> 45:22.087
- Sarah.

45:22.120 --> 45:24.422
Please don't go back inside.

45:24.455 --> 45:27.993
You will lose everything
beautiful about you.

45:38.904 --> 45:45.844
*

45:54.319 --> 45:59.224
This has been a season of loss.

45:59.257 --> 46:01.526
The loss of our beloved Steve,

46:01.559 --> 46:03.094
who climbed The Ladder

46:03.128 --> 46:06.164
and brought this all to us.

46:06.197 --> 46:09.500
That incredible day in 1974

46:09.534 --> 46:12.170
when we climbed...
Me, my husband, Bill...

46:12.203 --> 46:15.841
- We all know the story
of the climb, Felicia,

46:15.874 --> 46:19.344
but what we haven't
figured out is...

46:19.377 --> 46:21.279
Is what comes next.

46:21.312 --> 46:23.849
Um...

46:23.882 --> 46:26.584
Thanks, Felicia.

46:26.617 --> 46:30.321
It occurred to me
on this Ascension Day,

46:30.355 --> 46:34.993
maybe we need to really

46:35.026 --> 46:38.964
take a moment to live
where we are now.

46:38.997 --> 46:40.031
Right?

46:40.065 --> 46:45.436
Take this moment to stop...

46:45.470 --> 46:48.073
And...

46:48.106 --> 46:51.542
And hold the loss, right?

46:51.576 --> 46:53.278
- Right.
- Yes.

46:53.311 --> 46:55.513
And we have to...

46:55.546 --> 46:57.582
nurture it.

46:57.615 --> 47:00.986
And cradle it like we would

47:01.019 --> 47:03.889
our child.

47:06.925 --> 47:13.098
*

47:17.168 --> 47:20.438
So that we can let it go.

47:20.471 --> 47:22.573
Into the ether,

47:22.607 --> 47:26.544
where all the...
The lost things go.

47:26.577 --> 47:28.947
Time and money we wasted,

47:28.980 --> 47:32.417
and... and...
And loves we lost.

47:32.450 --> 47:37.923
*

47:37.956 --> 47:40.558
Where the dead go.

47:40.591 --> 47:46.364
*

47:48.466 --> 47:50.535
*

47:54.139 --> 47:57.075
*

47:57.108 --> 47:59.544
And release.

47:59.577 --> 48:02.280
Yes.

48:02.313 --> 48:04.382
- So that...
- Yes!

48:04.415 --> 48:07.185
We have room...

48:07.218 --> 48:11.289
Room to gain...

48:11.322 --> 48:13.391
Yes!

48:13.424 --> 48:16.027
So we can enter

48:16.061 --> 48:20.231
into this next shining era

48:20.265 --> 48:21.967
of The Movement.

48:25.336 --> 48:29.307
*

48:32.343 --> 48:33.378
*

48:33.411 --> 48:36.047
- * I'll carry you

48:36.081 --> 48:38.649
* You'll carry me

48:38.683 --> 48:41.252
* I'll carry you

48:41.286 --> 48:43.989
* You carry me

48:44.022 --> 48:46.424
* We will carry each other *

48:46.457 --> 48:50.128
* To The Light, oh, Light

48:50.161 --> 48:54.432
* Carry each other
to The Light *

48:54.465 --> 48:57.268
* We will carry each other

48:57.302 --> 49:00.638
* To The Light, oh, Light

49:00.671 --> 49:04.976
* Carry each other
to The Light *

49:05.010 --> 49:07.478
* I'll carry you

49:07.512 --> 49:10.215
* You'll carry me

49:10.248 --> 49:12.450
* I'll carry you

49:12.483 --> 49:15.553
* You carry me

49:15.586 --> 49:18.489
* We will carry each other

49:18.523 --> 49:20.558
* To The Light, oh, Light

49:20.591 --> 49:22.460
- What's going on?

49:45.716 --> 49:52.657
*

49:54.425 --> 49:55.626
- What's going on, Dad?

49:55.660 --> 49:57.662
- Find your mom.
- Get them out of here.

49:57.695 --> 50:00.031
*

50:00.065 --> 50:02.500
- What's your dad doing?

50:02.533 --> 50:05.236
He believes he's
the rightful Guardian.

50:05.270 --> 50:09.207
*

50:09.240 --> 50:11.609
- Hank. No more. Please.

50:13.411 --> 50:16.081
Hank.

50:16.114 --> 50:23.054
*

50:37.135 --> 50:40.638
Thank you.

50:40.671 --> 50:43.174
Oh! Ah.

50:43.208 --> 50:45.110
- You're back.

50:45.143 --> 50:47.112
- Yes, I am.

50:47.145 --> 50:52.217
*

50:52.250 --> 50:54.285
- Welcome back.

50:54.319 --> 51:01.259
*

51:13.738 --> 51:15.140
- We need to talk.

51:15.173 --> 51:16.383
- There's nothing to talk about.

51:16.407 --> 51:19.377
- Cal has taken
the role of Guardian.

51:19.410 --> 51:21.412
Eddie was chosen,
but his actions

51:21.446 --> 51:23.348
have proven him to be unworthy.

51:23.381 --> 51:24.591
- There's nothing
I could possibly do.

51:24.615 --> 51:26.151
- This will be the end
of The Movement.

51:26.184 --> 51:27.652
- Maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

51:27.685 --> 51:30.188
- I saw The Ladder, Sarah.

51:30.221 --> 51:33.658
My hands.
My hands burned.

51:33.691 --> 51:35.293
For this moment.

51:35.326 --> 51:37.495
So that I would never
waver from faith.

51:37.528 --> 51:39.397
You... you made mistakes.

51:39.430 --> 51:41.466
But you put us above everything.

51:41.499 --> 51:44.469
And you'd do it again.

51:44.502 --> 51:46.437
There are children...
Your children... here.

51:46.471 --> 51:48.839
Together, we can put
the rightful one in place.

51:48.873 --> 51:51.342
And if there is no right one,

51:51.376 --> 51:52.910
you, Sarah,

51:52.943 --> 51:57.648
you must take the role yourself.

52:00.685 --> 52:02.353
*

52:02.387 --> 52:04.855
- We have...
- And on this Ascension Day,

52:04.889 --> 52:08.659
we embrace... we... we pardon

52:08.693 --> 52:10.795
those who have left.

52:10.828 --> 52:14.265
And our Deniers,

52:14.299 --> 52:19.270
we take them back... we take them
back into our embrace.

52:19.304 --> 52:21.572
*

52:21.606 --> 52:24.842
* Everything

52:24.875 --> 52:26.544
*

52:26.577 --> 52:28.613
* Everything

52:28.646 --> 52:31.282
- Hi.
- So nice to have them back.

52:31.316 --> 52:34.185
* Everything Welcome home.

52:34.219 --> 52:36.187
We missed you.

52:36.221 --> 52:40.525
* Everything

52:40.558 --> 52:43.861
* In its right place

52:43.894 --> 52:45.230
How are you?

52:45.263 --> 52:47.398
- I told you.

52:47.432 --> 52:50.401
Now you really need to do
something about Eddie Lane.

52:50.435 --> 52:51.969
* In its right

52:52.002 --> 52:56.541
* Yesterday, I woke up
sucking on a lemon *

52:56.574 --> 52:58.876
* Yesterday, I woke up

52:58.909 --> 53:01.446
* Sucking on a lemon

53:01.479 --> 53:03.748
* Yesterday, I woke up

53:03.781 --> 53:09.954
* Sucking a lemon

53:09.987 --> 53:11.656
* Everything

53:11.689 --> 53:14.825
Oh, give me a hug.

53:14.859 --> 53:18.496
* Everything

53:18.529 --> 53:19.597
*

53:19.630 --> 53:24.435
* Everything

53:24.469 --> 53:29.240
* In its right place

53:29.274 --> 53:30.608
* In its right

53:30.641 --> 53:34.279
* Place

53:34.312 --> 53:35.580
* In its right

53:35.613 --> 53:39.350
* Place

53:39.384 --> 53:45.256
* Right place

53:45.290 --> 53:48.326
* There are two colors

53:48.359 --> 53:49.960
* In my head

53:49.994 --> 53:53.298
* There are two colors

53:53.331 --> 53:54.932
* In my head

53:54.965 --> 53:57.535
* What, what is that

53:57.568 --> 53:59.637
* You tried to say

53:59.670 --> 54:02.373
* What, what was that

54:02.407 --> 54:04.642
* You tried to say

54:04.675 --> 54:11.349
*

54:12.305 --> 54:18.725
