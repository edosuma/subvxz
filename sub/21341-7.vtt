01:13.907 --> 01:17.111
Riley, I thought we were
going to play in the pool

01:17.145 --> 01:18.412
after you called your mom.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.548
Yean, I don't feel
like it now.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.783
Hmm...

01:24.918 --> 01:26.620
Dana!

01:26.654 --> 01:28.822
What happened
on the phone?

01:28.856 --> 01:32.426
Nothing,
it doesn't matter.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.661
Okay, okay.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.296
She said she's
still working

01:35.329 --> 01:38.098
and won't be back home
for a few more days.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.506
You miss her?

01:45.539 --> 01:46.774
A lot.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.210
You know what I do
when I'm sad?

01:49.243 --> 01:51.545
- Dino experiment?
- Exactly.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.714
Don't you do those
when you're happy too?

01:53.747 --> 01:57.385
Yes and bored
or excited or nervous.

01:57.418 --> 02:00.188
Really, any feeling.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.556
Do you want to
do one with me?

02:02.590 --> 02:03.824
It might
cheer you up.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.595
Okay.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.231
Except we can't do
the dino experiment.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.633
Oh, why?

02:12.666 --> 02:13.934
Because we're doing

02:13.967 --> 02:15.736
a prehistoric marine
reptile experiment.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.306
What's the difference?

02:18.339 --> 02:19.873
Prehistoric
marine reptiles

02:19.907 --> 02:22.676
are creatures that lived
at the same time as dinosaurs

02:22.710 --> 02:24.445
but instead of
living on land...

02:24.478 --> 02:26.680
- They lived in the water?
- Right.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.849
Today, we're going to
try to figure out

02:28.882 --> 02:30.684
what they would have
sounded like underwater.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.353
But to figure that out,

02:32.386 --> 02:35.189
wouldn't we need to go back
to when dinosaurs lived

02:35.223 --> 02:37.358
in some sort of
a time traveling submarine?

02:37.391 --> 02:39.293
Yes.
Yes, we would.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.877
I don't hear anything,
captain Dana.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.680
Me neither,
Admiral Riley.

02:59.713 --> 03:02.583
Maybe we should try
different sounds.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.385
Good idea.

03:04.418 --> 03:07.221

03:17.698 --> 03:20.401
Maybe underwater prehistoric
marine reptiles

03:20.434 --> 03:22.370
didn't make any sounds?

03:22.403 --> 03:24.004
[distant squealing]

03:24.037 --> 03:25.573
Did you hear that?

03:25.606 --> 03:27.475
There it is again.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.209
It's coming
from this way.

03:34.282 --> 03:38.419
[***]

03:38.452 --> 03:40.421
It's getting closer.

03:40.454 --> 03:45.326
[distant squealing]

03:50.464 --> 03:51.965
And closer.

03:51.999 --> 03:56.404
[distant squealing]

03:56.437 --> 03:58.339
And close...

04:00.541 --> 04:03.010
It's inside the sub.
In that torpedo tube.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.713
Open it.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.615
You open it.
You're the Admiral.

Aww.

04:20.328 --> 04:23.297
[squeals]

04:23.331 --> 04:25.433
What is it?

04:25.466 --> 04:28.001
A baby plesiosaur.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.704
[both]
Aw...

04:33.106 --> 04:35.409
But what is it?

04:35.443 --> 04:37.010
This is it.

04:37.044 --> 04:39.547
Plesiosaurs are prehistoric
marine reptiles

04:39.580 --> 04:41.749
with super long necks
and four flippers.

04:41.782 --> 04:45.486
But, if we found its baby
then where's it's mom?

04:45.519 --> 04:46.954
Maybe she lost it.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.590
Aw.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.325
It's probably sad
and missing her.

04:51.359 --> 04:54.595
We have to get that baby
back to its mom, captain.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.364
Aye, Aye,
Admiral.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.832
[both gasp]

05:00.601 --> 05:03.371
Don't worry, baby.
I know you're sad.

We'll get you back
to your mom, I promise.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.013
Let's get back
to the control room

05:13.046 --> 05:14.615
and see what it is.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.718
And it's my turn
to hold the baby.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.998
What's uh oh?

05:31.031 --> 05:32.900
Take a look.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.036
[***]

05:36.069 --> 05:37.638
Uh oh.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.972
What is it?

05:39.006 --> 05:41.074
A Deinosuchus.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.643
What's a Deinosuchus?

05:45.479 --> 05:48.048
This is a Deinosuchus.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.518
- A crocodile?
- A crocodile?

05:50.551 --> 05:53.120
More like the biggest
crocodile that ever lived.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.422
That's not good.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.824
No, it's not.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.659
The Deinosuchus
is a carnivore

05:58.692 --> 06:00.628
that eats small
sea creatures.

06:00.661 --> 06:04.465
Small sea creatures
like baby plesiosaurs?

06:05.933 --> 06:07.801

Rise, rise, rising!

06:43.537 --> 06:46.139

06:46.173 --> 06:48.208
I don't hear
anymore snapping.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.078
We lost
the Deinosuchus.

06:52.680 --> 06:56.149
[distant roar]

06:56.183 --> 06:58.786
But we found
something else.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.990
[roars]

07:03.023 --> 07:04.592
Crocodile snout?

07:04.625 --> 07:06.894
It looks like
another Deinosuchus

07:06.927 --> 07:09.697
but why is this one
a different color?

07:09.730 --> 07:12.933
I don't think
it's a Deinosuchus.

07:12.966 --> 07:17.871
[roars]

07:19.039 --> 07:20.574
That's a Spinosaurus.

07:20.608 --> 07:21.975
What's a Spinosaurus?

07:23.977 --> 07:26.480
This is
a Spinosaurus.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.248
Another prehistoric
marine reptile?

07:28.281 --> 07:30.618
I can see why you
would think that

07:30.651 --> 07:33.754
but it's a dinosaur
that can swim underwater.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.189
Did he eat baby
plesiosaurs too?

07:36.223 --> 07:38.759
It ate anything it could
get its crocodile snout

07:38.792 --> 07:40.694
and long claws on.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.530
Like our sub?

[gasps]

07:47.067 --> 07:50.070
[roars]

07:53.273 --> 07:55.242
We need to shake off
that dino.

07:56.644 --> 07:57.745
I'm trying.

07:57.778 --> 08:00.714
[roars]

08:02.550 --> 08:04.117
Now the Deinosuchus
has us too.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.252
It's okay, baby.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.054
I don't know how

08:07.087 --> 08:09.623
we're gonna get you
out of this, it's okay.

08:09.657 --> 08:12.626
My mom would know how
to get us out of this.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.828
- I wish I could call her.
- That's it.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.664
- We should call my mom?
- No.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.198
We should call
the baby's mom.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.133
Plesiosaurs are
as long as a bus

08:20.167 --> 08:21.869
and may have
traveled in groups.

08:21.902 --> 08:24.271
They can scare off the
Spinosaurus and the Deinosuchus.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.640
Baby, we need you
to call your mom

08:26.674 --> 08:28.275
as loud as you can.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.706

Your wish is my command.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.258

But I thought you-

09:51.291 --> 09:53.927
After your call,
I decided to come home early.

What are you
two up to?

09:58.365 --> 10:01.068
Prehistoric marine

10:01.101 --> 10:02.836

submarine.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.205
Do you want to
join us on a mission?

10:05.238 --> 10:07.307
Can I be Admiral?

10:07.340 --> 10:09.009
You can be the commander.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.844
Can I play too?

10:10.878 --> 10:12.813
You're the Deinosuchus.

Good morning, Roland.

Oh...

11:59.452 --> 12:01.421
Hey,
Mr. Hendrickson.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.290
Mr. Hendrickson,
you won't believe

12:03.323 --> 12:04.925
what I just saw.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.961
Tyrannosaurus Rex,
but I don't know where it went.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.930
Are those binoculars?
Can I borrow them?

12:09.963 --> 12:12.232
Uh...

12:12.265 --> 12:15.502
Whoa, I can see right into
Ms. Curry's house.

12:15.535 --> 12:18.505
No, you can't.
Can you?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.009
What are you doing

12:22.042 --> 12:24.211
with all this stuff,
anyway?

12:24.244 --> 12:27.447
Well, I was
bird watching.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.816
Alone.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.184
- Do you like looking at birds?
- Yes.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.920
I like looking
at dinosaurs.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.155
That's great,
for you.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.891
Hey, Mr. Hendrickson.
We're samesies.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.126
Dinosaurs came from birds

12:39.159 --> 12:41.494
so we both like
looking at the same thing.

12:41.528 --> 12:44.965
- I'm not sure they're the same.
- Oh no, they are.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.534
Think about it.
Do birds lay eggs?

12:47.567 --> 12:49.436
Yes, of course they do.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.305
Guess who else did?

12:52.339 --> 12:54.842
I'll help you.
Dinosaurs.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.144
Birds have feathers.

12:57.177 --> 13:00.313
Guess who else did?

13:00.347 --> 13:02.482
It's the same
answer as before.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.417
Dinosaurs?

13:04.451 --> 13:07.420
Yes, birds had
wings for flying.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.457
Guess who else did.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.225
Dinosaurs.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.361
Ehn!
Trick question.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.529
Dinosaurs didn't have
wings that flew.

13:16.563 --> 13:19.032
Prehistoric winged
reptiles did.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.001
Don't feel bad
about getting it wrong.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.469
A lot of people do.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.905
Hey, can I dino
watch with you

13:24.938 --> 13:26.874
in case a T-Rex
shows up again?

13:26.907 --> 13:29.542
Well, it's kind of
a solo sport.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.344
Hey, Ms. Curry.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.346
I like your hat and boots.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.215
Oh, thanks.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.917
Guess what?

13:36.950 --> 13:39.286
Mr. Hendrickson is letting me
bird watch with him.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.989
Wow, that's very
kind of you, Roland.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.157
Oh, it's nothing.

13:44.191 --> 13:47.427
Helping the youth
and improving minds,

13:47.460 --> 13:49.396
ETC, ETC.

13:52.265 --> 13:55.402
Well, if you're going to
insist on joining me,

13:55.435 --> 13:58.972
then you're going to need
your own proper chair.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.640
Thanks, Mr. Hendrickson.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.210
I'll stay on the look out
while you're gone.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.145
Oh, and can you
bring me back

14:05.178 --> 14:07.347
some water or juice
if you have it?

14:07.380 --> 14:09.249
Anything but grapefruit
or cranberry.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.151
Those are gross.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.920
Okay.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.888
Thanks,
Mr. Hendrickson.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.261
Now all I have to do
is wait for...

14:21.294 --> 14:23.596
what?

14:23.630 --> 14:25.565
That was strange.

14:27.134 --> 14:28.535
What's doing that?

14:31.538 --> 14:34.074
[roars]

14:36.977 --> 14:38.611
The T-Rex is back.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.081
[snorts]

14:41.114 --> 14:44.017
What do you smell, T-Rex?

14:44.051 --> 14:47.187
Another dinosaur?
Maybe something to eat?

14:50.090 --> 14:51.959
[roars]

14:51.992 --> 14:54.427
Another T-Rex?

14:54.461 --> 14:56.964
I wonder if they're
going to fight.

14:56.997 --> 15:00.633
[roars]

15:00.667 --> 15:03.136
[chomps]

15:03.170 --> 15:04.704
[roars]

15:04.737 --> 15:07.507
I'd run away if I were you,
littler T-Rex.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.410
That other T-Rex
is a lot bigger than you.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.613
[roars]

15:13.646 --> 15:16.683
[grunting]

15:16.716 --> 15:19.386
What's it doing?

15:19.419 --> 15:23.523
[roars]

15:23.556 --> 15:26.559
[***]

15:26.593 --> 15:28.996
[roars]

15:29.029 --> 15:30.630
[groans]

15:34.501 --> 15:36.303
That was weird.

15:41.208 --> 15:44.044
Mr. Hendrickson, you won't
believe what I just saw.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.579
Don't tell me you just
a saw Kirkland's Warbler.

15:46.613 --> 15:50.350
Um, no.
I just saw two T-Rex's.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.618
Really?

15:51.651 --> 15:54.221
Yeah, and one was way
bigger than the other.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.389
- She must have been female.
- What?

15:56.423 --> 15:59.692
You did tell me that dinosaurs
are a lot like birds, right?

15:59.726 --> 16:01.694
- Yep.
- Well, most bird species

16:01.728 --> 16:03.630
the females is
larger than the male.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.999
So, it was a boy
and girl T-Rex?

16:06.033 --> 16:07.500
But that doesn't explain

16:07.534 --> 16:09.602
why the boy was
moving so strangely.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.637
What do you mean?

16:10.670 --> 16:12.305
The smaller boy dino

16:12.339 --> 16:15.375
was kind of dancing around
the bigger girl one like this.

16:15.408 --> 16:18.545
[laughs]

16:18.578 --> 16:20.280
What's so funny?

16:20.313 --> 16:22.349
Well, sometimes
the male bird

16:22.382 --> 16:25.185
will do a little dance
to impress the female bird.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.187
-Really?
-Yeah, let me see.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.655
This uh...

16:32.625 --> 16:34.461
Ah.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.529
That's a bird
of Paradise.

16:36.563 --> 16:39.266
See how the male
is dancing around the female?

16:39.299 --> 16:42.035
He wants to show her
that he's the strongest.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.703
Cool.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.372
I've got some
more information

16:45.405 --> 16:47.307
on birds of paradise
in my apartment.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.109
I'll be right back.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.178
[roars]

16:53.780 --> 16:56.249
Looks like you could
use a dance teacher.

16:58.185 --> 17:02.189
[***]

17:02.222 --> 17:04.491
[roars]

17:07.360 --> 17:09.296
[snorts]

17:09.329 --> 17:10.430
Hey, T-Rex.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.599
We need to teach you
some dance moves

17:12.632 --> 17:14.534
so you can impress
that girl T-Rex.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.236
Just follow me.

17:16.269 --> 17:19.139
* [dance music]

17:19.172 --> 17:21.808
Come on, T-Rex.
Don't you want her to like you?

17:21.841 --> 17:23.410
[roars]

17:23.443 --> 17:27.214
* [dance music]

17:27.247 --> 17:29.616
Nice moves, T-Rex.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.185
* [dance music]

17:32.219 --> 17:33.553
[roars]

17:33.586 --> 17:35.255
Look who's here.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.591
[roars]

17:39.892 --> 17:42.095
Another male T-Rex?

17:44.197 --> 17:46.133
We need to step
it up T-Rex.

17:46.166 --> 17:49.736
* [dance music]

17:52.705 --> 17:54.574
We need a big finish.

17:54.607 --> 17:58.211
* [dance music]

17:58.245 --> 18:02.682
[roars]

18:04.784 --> 18:06.386
Oh no.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.322
That other male T-Rex
is a better impresser.

18:09.356 --> 18:11.691
Sorry, T-Rex.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.560
I'll think of something.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.429
[Mr. Hendrickson]
Dana?

18:24.804 --> 18:27.140
I'm sorry,
this is all I could get

18:27.174 --> 18:29.709
on the Bird of Paradise
on such short notice.

18:29.742 --> 18:32.879
Mr. Hendrickson,
it's too late.

18:32.912 --> 18:36.149
He already lost
to a better dancing T-Rex.

18:36.183 --> 18:38.451
That's no excuse
to give up.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.753
Now see these
birds here?

18:40.787 --> 18:42.322
They're not
always successful

18:42.355 --> 18:43.490
but they keep trying.

18:43.523 --> 18:44.924
Like this one.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.527
It's called the superb
bird of paradise.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.362
See how he's hopping?

18:49.396 --> 18:52.465
Showing others
how strong he is.

18:52.499 --> 18:53.700
Yeah.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.468
[laughs]

18:55.502 --> 18:58.305
Whoa, cool moves, Roland.
I didn't know you could dance.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.707
I can't, really,
I'm just hopping.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.509
Well, you're very agile.

19:02.542 --> 19:05.312
You know, I was wondering
if I could interest you

19:05.345 --> 19:06.913
in a little walk.

19:06.946 --> 19:10.417
Well, I unfortunately-

19:10.450 --> 19:11.784
It's okay,
Mr. Hendrickson.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.753
I think you've
given me my answer.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.456
- Thank you.
- There you go, come on.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.425
I, I really should help.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.695
[growls]

19:22.729 --> 19:24.464
Hey, T-Rex.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.600
It's time to jump around

19:27.634 --> 19:32.505
* [upbeat hip hop]

19:36.876 --> 19:40.547
[growls]

19:40.580 --> 19:43.383

19:43.416 --> 19:45.585

Good job, T-Rex.

20:23.856 --> 20:27.594
[both roar]

20:27.627 --> 20:29.462
I think she likes you.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.936
You want dance
lessons now too?
