WEBVTT

00:34.951 --> 00:39.205
I came up with the best episode
of <i>West Wing</i> in my dream last night.

00:39.289 --> 00:43.501
There was a new janitor,
and he was dusting near the button.

00:43.585 --> 00:44.878
Sounds exciting.

00:44.961 --> 00:46.755
You know what else is exciting?

00:46.838 --> 00:49.424
It's the Eighth Grade Job Shadow Week.

00:49.507 --> 00:52.594
Ready to spend a week
working in the real world, son?

00:52.677 --> 00:55.847
Yep, I've even practiced
my office small talk.

00:55.930 --> 00:56.931


00:57.015 --> 01:01.770
I know it's only Tuesday,
but it feels like Friday.

01:01.853 --> 01:02.729


01:02.812 --> 01:05.315

Joe Jack'll love that one.

01:05.398 --> 01:08.443
Now, remember, sign up is
in the gymnasium at lunch,

01:08.526 --> 01:10.195
so just come register at my booth,

01:10.278 --> 01:12.072
and we'll head straight over
to Strickland.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.157
Uh, yeah, about that.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.492
I was thinking,

01:15.575 --> 01:18.912
I've heard you talk about propane
for 13 years,

01:18.995 --> 01:22.248
so maybe I should try something... fun.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.251
Or new?

01:25.335 --> 01:27.629
This isn't about doing something new,
Bobby.

01:27.712 --> 01:28.963
It's about taking advantage

01:29.047 --> 01:31.299
of the great head start
you've already got.

01:31.382 --> 01:33.468
You do a good job at Strickland this week,

01:33.551 --> 01:37.305
you'll have almost your whole life
figured out by age 14.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.266
Uh... okay.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.310
Hank, Bobby is a young man.

01:42.393 --> 01:45.647
Don't you think he should be learning
to make his own decisions?

01:47.398 --> 01:49.359
Hank, did you hear what I asked?

01:49.442 --> 01:52.153
-I asked if you thought that Bobby...
-Of course he should.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.863
I'm not forcing the boy.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.698
I know he'll find his own way.

01:55.782 --> 01:58.827
Just remember, I'll be under
the north end basketball net.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.245
You know my cell number, right?

02:00.328 --> 02:02.038
Uh-huh.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.207
Anyway, about my dream.

02:04.332 --> 02:07.460
Now, should I send it to them,
or should I shoot it first?

02:10.213 --> 02:12.006
This is so exciting.

02:12.090 --> 02:15.468
I just hope there isn't a big rush
for the medical textbook proofreader.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.554
I got dibs on the insurance rep.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.931
My future starts today.

02:20.014 --> 02:21.850
You guys are so lucky.

02:21.933 --> 02:24.853
My dad's leaning on me
to spend the week at Strickland,

02:24.936 --> 02:28.022
and the first day is
just gonna be a safety lecture

02:28.106 --> 02:31.109
about open flames and runaway trucks.

02:31.192 --> 02:32.944
Huh?

02:47.458 --> 02:48.793
Hey.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.171
Ooh.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.006
I like pecans.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.925
Oh, that could be fun.

02:56.676 --> 02:59.512
They've got everything.

03:00.930 --> 03:01.848
Bobby.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.268
Bobby.

03:12.650 --> 03:14.152
O-Over here.

03:15.653 --> 03:18.281
-Quickly, B-Bobby. Now.
-Hey, Mr. Hill.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.824
I want to do propane.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.995
Uh-huh. Well, uh...

03:24.078 --> 03:25.580
thanks for your interest, Joseph,

03:25.663 --> 03:27.832
but there's really
just one opening with us,

03:27.916 --> 03:29.667
and I'm saving it for Bobby.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.461
Oh, okay.

03:31.961 --> 03:33.129
Hold on there, son.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.298
Hank, you can't do that.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.550
This program's on a first-come,
first-serve basis.

03:37.634 --> 03:41.387
But Principal Moss, I'm saving this spot
for Bobby, and I...

03:41.471 --> 03:43.681
I don't want him shadowing me.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.266
I'm sorry, Hank.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.769
I don't know exactly
what ethnicity that boy is,

03:47.852 --> 03:48.853
but he's something.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.271
My hands are tied here.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.235
Welcome to Strickland Propane.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.778
Oh, sweet.

03:57.528 --> 04:00.198
Okay, pick something, quick.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.334
Well, Dad, let's make it legal.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.712
You're a little late, son.
Joseph's already taken your spot.

04:15.922 --> 04:16.965
Sorry, dude.

04:17.924 --> 04:19.467
What am I supposed to do?

04:19.550 --> 04:21.469
Everything else is already taken.

04:21.886 --> 04:24.097
It's all right, Bobby.
You see that booth over there?

04:24.180 --> 04:25.723
No one's signed up with him yet.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.394
-Earth Cleaners.
-Never heard of it.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.396
Very successful local business.

04:31.479 --> 04:32.480
Better hurry.

04:37.652 --> 04:40.405
Do you think I could get a ninth grader,
if she was ugly?

04:43.074 --> 04:45.702
-Hi, I'm Bobby Hill.
-Well, all right.

04:46.077 --> 04:49.831
I'm Peter Sterling, founder and president
of this little situation here.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.125
So what do we got?
Some sweet sign-up action?

04:52.208 --> 04:54.877
Yep, I'm supposed to be
your shadow this week.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.462
Well, all right.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.881
We're gonna have some
delightful times, <i>mi amigo.</i>

04:58.965 --> 05:01.050
-Really?
-Oh, you better believe it.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.719
We're gonna tear it up old school.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.596
Earth Cleaners must be
about the environment, right?

05:05.680 --> 05:07.974
Do we wash monkeys?

05:08.057 --> 05:09.225
Can I take one home?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.352
Nothing like that, Bobby.

05:11.436 --> 05:15.231
At Earth Cleaners, we only do one thing,
but we do it so sweet.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.109
We pick up poo.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.321
We pick up poo?

05:21.404 --> 05:23.239
Oh, we pick up mountains of it.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.159
Whose poo are we picking up?

05:26.242 --> 05:28.328
Ninety percent dogs, 10 percent other.

05:31.289 --> 05:34.250
Mr. Sterling, I have to make a phone call.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.543
Absolutely, <i>mi amigo.</i>

05:35.626 --> 05:38.212
Just meet me around back in five
and we'll rock and roll.

05:41.632 --> 05:43.634
<i>From the switchback ignition system</i>

05:43.718 --> 05:46.346
to the heavy-duty,
welded, stainless steel,

05:46.429 --> 05:48.056
the Char King Imperiale

05:48.139 --> 05:50.850
is the Vogner Company's
love letter to America.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.603
She's pretty hot.
Did you guys ever do anything?

05:57.940 --> 06:00.068
I've been looking all over for you, honey.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.861
It's a message from your son.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.239
"Dad, you've got to let me shadow you.

06:05.323 --> 06:06.657
Do whatever it takes.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.826
I want to be at Strickland Propane."

06:10.078 --> 06:12.872
Dang it, I've got to get Buck
to open another position here.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.918
You know, if you twist
that valve far enough,

06:17.001 --> 06:18.252
you'll kill us all.

06:18.836 --> 06:21.339
Why don't you just stand outside?

06:29.889 --> 06:31.057
Whoa.

06:31.140 --> 06:32.475
Hop on the sled, partner.

06:38.564 --> 06:41.109
Thanks for letting my boy
shadow you, Hank.

06:41.192 --> 06:44.237
Sooner or later,
Nancy's earning power is gonna crap out,

06:44.320 --> 06:46.072
and he's gonna have to pick up the slack.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.031
Uh-huh.

06:47.115 --> 06:50.368
You know what's great is that
Bobby's gonna be at Strickland, too.

06:50.451 --> 06:53.413
I got a message from him
saying how much he wants to be there.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.622
That's beautiful, Hank.

06:54.705 --> 06:57.500
Father and son working side by side.

06:57.792 --> 06:58.709
Beautiful.

06:58.793 --> 07:02.463
With the early start Bobby's getting,
there's no telling where he'll end up.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.882
Maybe Strickland North.

07:07.009 --> 07:08.094
Wow.

07:08.761 --> 07:11.013
I told you guys
we didn't have to leave the alley

07:11.097 --> 07:12.265
to see interesting things.

07:12.348 --> 07:13.266
Hey, Dad.

07:13.349 --> 07:17.145
Uh, Bobby, why don't you give
this nice man his costume back,

07:17.228 --> 07:18.229
and we'll hit the grill.

07:18.312 --> 07:19.605
I'll show you what you missed.

07:19.689 --> 07:23.067
No, Dad, I decided
I'm sticking with Earth Cleaners.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.902
It's the best job ever.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.028
But the message...

07:26.112 --> 07:27.155
I thought...

07:27.697 --> 07:29.615
What does Earth Cleaners do, anyway?

07:29.699 --> 07:31.117
Why don't we show him, partner?

07:32.994 --> 07:34.078
Yeah.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.543
You, uh...

07:40.626 --> 07:42.086
...you pick up poop?

07:42.170 --> 07:43.004
That's right.

07:43.087 --> 07:44.172
"Earth Cleaners:

07:44.255 --> 07:46.924
We pick up where your dog leaves off."

07:47.008 --> 07:48.009
Whoa, Bobby.

07:48.092 --> 07:49.552
Looks like you got triplets there.

07:58.019 --> 08:02.899
My boy is gonna spend an entire week
picking up dog poop for school credit.

08:02.982 --> 08:06.652
I hate to say this, but it seems like
the system's not working.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.489
Education today is so complicated.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.616
As a parent, I'd like to change things.

08:11.699 --> 08:12.992
Though, as an educator,

08:13.075 --> 08:15.077
I'd like people to mind
their own damn business.

08:15.161 --> 08:19.081
Well, I can't control education,
but I can control my son.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.708
I'm pulling Bobby out of this thing.

08:20.791 --> 08:23.252
If you do that,
he'll resist you all the way.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.756
The only way for us to win here
is to be supportive.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.760
Well, it feels like
this is one of those things

08:30.843 --> 08:32.553
where if we support it now,

08:32.637 --> 08:35.223
we'll just wind up
having to accept it later.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.600
Bobby has to learn to make choices now.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.978
Do you want to spend the rest of your life
making his choices for him?

08:41.062 --> 08:42.355
Well, why not?

08:42.438 --> 08:43.689
I do it for Bill.

08:47.401 --> 08:50.196
I never thought
working outdoors could be fun.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.782
Now I don't know
how I could do anything else.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.242
Oh, it's sweet, Bobby.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.619
But that's only one of the great things
about this gig.

08:56.702 --> 08:57.828
I don't have a boss,

08:57.912 --> 09:01.541
I make my own hours, there's no stress,
and the business is rock steady.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.376
You know how they say that death and taxes

09:03.459 --> 09:05.461
are the only things
you can count on in life?

09:05.836 --> 09:07.755
Well, look what they forgot.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.133
Aww, yeah.

09:12.301 --> 09:14.887
So if you provide
excellent customer service,

09:14.971 --> 09:17.807
you don't have to apologize
for charging a little bit more

09:17.890 --> 09:19.058
than the competition.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.811
-So what do you think of that, Joseph?
-Cool.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.479
Uh,

09:23.563 --> 09:25.982
well, it's a little bit
more than just cool.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.359
It's the guiding principle of our whole...

09:34.282 --> 09:36.534
Uh, Joseph,
I don't know if you realize it,

09:36.617 --> 09:38.744
but you just drank from my soda can.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.663
I only took a sip, dude.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.004
Oh, God.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.011
Yep.

09:55.511 --> 09:56.345
Yep.

09:56.929 --> 09:57.847
Mm-hmm.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.142
Speaking of Joseph,
how's he doing at Strickland, Hank?

10:01.225 --> 10:03.811
Uh... he's doing fine, I guess.

10:03.894 --> 10:04.812
Yes.

10:04.895 --> 10:07.732
I knew he'd make it,
if he'd just aimed low enough.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.776
Be honest with me, fellas.

10:10.860 --> 10:15.406
Would it bother you if your son was,
you know, doing what mine's doing?

10:15.489 --> 10:16.657
Uh...

10:16.741 --> 10:19.994
I don't see any problem... problem there.

10:20.077 --> 10:22.747
Hey, man, nothin' wrong
with them, dang ol' honest work, man.

10:22.830 --> 10:23.956
Probably wouldn't bother me.

10:24.540 --> 10:25.416
Hey, guys,

10:25.499 --> 10:26.584
I got a new one.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.295
What has red neck but brown hands?

10:29.378 --> 10:30.379
Bobby Hill.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.466
Brown...

10:36.469 --> 10:38.721
You know what the key to success
in business is, Bobby?

10:38.804 --> 10:39.680
Of course.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.724
My dad's been saying it my whole life.

10:41.807 --> 10:45.019
You find something that people want,
and you give it to them.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.396
Well, your dad's obviously
a very smart dude,

10:47.480 --> 10:49.023
very old school, very classy.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.191
But here's the problem.

10:50.274 --> 10:54.362
The whole stuff people want market,
well, it's, uh, all pretty much locked up.

10:54.445 --> 10:55.696
There's nothing new to give people.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.782
So my key to business success is this.

10:57.865 --> 11:01.035
You find the thing that
no one else wants to do, and you do it.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.454
That's brilliant.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.289
It's working pretty sweet for me.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.875
Think about it.
Any idiot can pick up a piece of poo.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.794
But, nine times out of ten, he doesn't.

11:10.127 --> 11:12.254
Well, I'm no idiot.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.508
Well, all right.

11:16.884 --> 11:19.428
I just wish my dad
understood the business more.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.639
I don't think he gets why it's so great.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.641
Oh, we can fix that, <i>mi amigo.</i>

11:23.724 --> 11:26.894
He just needs his own little taste
of the Peter Sterling lifestyle.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.651
Do we really have to do this?

11:33.734 --> 11:35.319
Yes.

11:35.403 --> 11:38.364
-Well, this is his street.
-Number 237.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.452
Peter Sterling lives here?

11:46.497 --> 11:47.540
Well, all right.

11:47.832 --> 11:48.958
Welcome, Hills.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.252
Oh, my God.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.795
Look at this place.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.047
Good Lord.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.632
Liking the casa, eh?

11:56.716 --> 11:57.633
Hi.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.468
That's my lovely lady, Sarah.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.847
Uh, Peter, do you have
another business or something?

12:02.930 --> 12:04.515
I, I hate to pry,

12:04.598 --> 12:08.561
but you couldn't have paid for all this
by just, uh, you know.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.604
-Oh, but I did.
-But I don't...

12:10.688 --> 12:12.523
I mean, how?

12:12.606 --> 12:14.525
Hank, my clientele is made up

12:14.608 --> 12:17.236
of practically every rich person
in the Heimlich County area.

12:17.319 --> 12:20.406
I've got almost no overhead expenses
and no competition.

12:20.489 --> 12:22.074
Dude, life is so sweet.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.952
Come on, folks. Let's grab some grub.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.167
Hank, Peggy,

12:31.250 --> 12:34.336
I just want to thank you both
for lending me Bobby for the week.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.923
Whatever he ends up doing,
Bobby's gonna be one successful dude.

12:40.509 --> 12:41.343
Hey.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.345
Did Bobby tell you
about our wild afternoon?

12:43.429 --> 12:46.056
No, but we support Bobby,
so we'd love to hear.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.475
Oh, it was crazy.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.310
We're scooping over
at the Strawbridge Estate,

12:49.393 --> 12:51.645
but we're coming across
some pretty weird-looking stuff.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.272
It was like nothing I'd ever seen.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.691
It was gigantic.
Too big even for the scoop.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.485
And it was really leafy.

12:57.568 --> 13:00.696
-Peter tried picking it up...
-But it just crumbled in my hands.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.407
So we're thinking,
what the heck's going on?

13:03.491 --> 13:06.952
-They only have one Irish Setter.
-You want to tell them what happened?

13:07.036 --> 13:09.830
Well, it turned out
the neighbor's fence is broken,

13:09.914 --> 13:13.000
and their farm of 28 alpacas
had gotten loose.

13:13.083 --> 13:17.838
They dropped product on every inch
of the Strawbridges' property.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.048
Yep, it was rough,

13:19.131 --> 13:20.174
but we made a mint on it,

13:20.257 --> 13:22.301
'cause we just started charging them
by the pound.

13:22.384 --> 13:23.385
Yeah, dawg.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.474
I've never really been a dinner person.

13:28.557 --> 13:30.893
I'm just gonna go sit in the car
for a few hours.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.778
-Well, did the third shower help?
-No, it did not.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.572
I can wash, but I cannot
wash away the memories.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.950
Well, thank God the week's over tomorrow,

13:46.033 --> 13:47.618
and everything will be back to normal.

13:49.995 --> 13:52.414
Product used to be
one of my favorite words.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.627
And if you shut the lid,

13:56.710 --> 14:01.173
you can get the indirect heat
up to 550 degrees in three minutes.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.174
Uh, yeah, yeah,

14:02.258 --> 14:04.260
and if you're cooking burgers or stuff,

14:04.343 --> 14:07.638
don't drop your cat in there,
'cause it could, like, explode.

14:07.721 --> 14:10.307
-Oh.
-Joseph, don't talk like that.

14:10.391 --> 14:11.809
Oh, sorry, dude.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.102
Look,

14:13.185 --> 14:16.397
this is your last day,
so why don't you just relax.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.859
Just stand over there
while Mrs. Ellis and I finish up.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.948
Joseph,
you've got to be more careful.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.659
-There's a lot at stake here.
-Dad?

14:28.742 --> 14:31.537
Yes, it is I, Dale, your father.

14:31.620 --> 14:32.538
What are you doing?

14:32.621 --> 14:36.292
I'm shadowing you to make sure
that you're properly shadowing Hank,

14:36.375 --> 14:38.586
which you are not.
Now, pay attention to him.

14:38.669 --> 14:41.005
Our financial future is at stake.

14:41.505 --> 14:44.675
Notice the way he gestures
gracefully with his hands.

14:45.259 --> 14:48.554
Look at his firm handshake
and direct eye contact.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.347
He appears confident,

14:50.431 --> 14:53.017
but not at all
like he wants to have sex with her.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.393
I'm trying, Dad.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.812
I don't want to put
any pressure on you, Joseph,

14:56.896 --> 14:59.398
but your parents' marriage
depends on this.

15:04.278 --> 15:07.281
Well, I'm just glad
this job shadow thing is over.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.450
It's high time everyone's kids went back

15:09.533 --> 15:10.659
to where they belong.

15:11.118 --> 15:12.411
Hey, Dad.

15:16.332 --> 15:19.335
Welcome home, son.
Did you enjoy your last day at work?

15:19.418 --> 15:21.629
Dad, it's not my last day.

15:21.712 --> 15:26.008
I'm taking Peter's business model,
and I'm starting my own company.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.344
What are you talking about?

15:28.427 --> 15:29.386
Hello?

15:29.470 --> 15:30.304
What?

15:30.387 --> 15:33.474
What do you mean "a vomit situation"?
Who is this?

15:33.557 --> 15:34.600
Oh, that's for me.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.019
Bobby Hill speaking.

15:37.436 --> 15:38.687
Yep, we do that.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.440
Please cordon off the area
and don't panic.

15:41.523 --> 15:42.900
I'll be right there.

15:42.983 --> 15:43.901
Got to run.

15:43.984 --> 15:47.696
It's like Peter always says,
customer service starts on time.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.532
-No, Bobby, you can't make a living...
-Sure I can.

15:50.783 --> 15:54.745
There's bounce houses, daycare centers,
and let's not forget bars.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.038
Dad, you were right.

15:56.121 --> 15:59.792
I've got almost my whole life figured out
before I'm 14.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.669
Now, hold on a minute, Bobby...

16:01.752 --> 16:02.586
Hill here.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.297
You bet I know where that is.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.341
The Delta Sigma Tau house.

16:07.424 --> 16:08.717
I've got it made.

16:09.259 --> 16:12.388
Dad, do you think
this jumpsuit is splatter-proof?

16:17.685 --> 16:18.852
<i>I don't get it.</i>

16:18.936 --> 16:22.106
You said you wanted me
to get an early start on my future.

16:22.189 --> 16:23.899
This job has a future.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.110
Bobby, did you wash your hands
before dinner?

16:26.193 --> 16:28.445
Well, there's more to a career
than money, son.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.197
There's the matter of respect.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.616
Bobby, did you wear that jumpsuit
to work today?

16:32.700 --> 16:35.953
First, you want me to have a future,
now, it's respect.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.372
I can't hit a moving target, Dad.

16:38.455 --> 16:41.458
My God, Bobby, your shoes.
Did you take your work shoes off?

16:41.542 --> 16:45.254
Other than the fact
that it's not the great almighty propane,

16:45.337 --> 16:48.340
show me just one downside to my career.

16:59.977 --> 17:04.523
So, I just don't want my son going
any further in this, uh, line of work.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.942
Do you have a problem
with what I do, Hank?

17:07.026 --> 17:07.860
Not at all.

17:07.943 --> 17:11.238
You provide a useful service,
and you do a quality job.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.991
Well, then, amigo,
I guess I'm a little confused.

17:14.074 --> 17:17.661
Look, Peter, you're a tall, handsome,
well-put together guy.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.288
And forgive me for saying this,

17:19.371 --> 17:21.373
but you're very... enchanting.

17:21.457 --> 17:24.209
I'm guessing you never had trouble
getting dates,

17:24.543 --> 17:27.504
and you probably never had
a cruel nickname stick to you.

17:27.588 --> 17:28.589
Everyone likes you.

17:28.672 --> 17:29.923
My son likes you.

17:30.007 --> 17:33.135
So, a guy like you
can pull off a career like this.

17:33.218 --> 17:37.556
Now, Bobby, well, he's a great kid,
but he's different than you.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.934
Well, maybe you got a point,
but Bobby's on his own now.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.603
What can I do for the little dude?

17:42.686 --> 17:45.856
Well, you could tell him
that the job isn't really so great.

17:45.939 --> 17:47.524
I can't lie to the little guy.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.905
Well, I'll just have to force him
to quit then,

17:52.988 --> 17:56.742
and deal with my own son hating me,
probably for quite a while.

18:02.039 --> 18:03.123
Well, all right.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.213
Well... all right.

18:10.464 --> 18:11.840
Let me get this straight.

18:11.924 --> 18:15.219
If I hurl, I just call you,
and you'll come get rid of it?

18:15.344 --> 18:16.261
Dude,

18:16.345 --> 18:18.055
that's the best thing I ever heard of.

18:18.138 --> 18:20.849
Now I can party
and, like, not hold back at all.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.017
Gentlemen,

18:22.101 --> 18:24.520
that's what I'm selling, freedom.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.396
I don't want to touch something
you touched.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.440
Could you put the card
in my pocket for me?

18:29.024 --> 18:30.109
Make the pledge do it.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.569
No way, man.
I don't know what he's touched.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.071
Okay, then eat my deodorant.

18:38.242 --> 18:39.118
Bobby,

18:39.201 --> 18:41.745
I'm sorry, but this ends right now.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.915
Hey, Bobby.

18:44.998 --> 18:47.292
Just came by to wish you much luck
with your new gig.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.627
Thanks, Peter.

18:51.421 --> 18:52.631
Got dang it, Peter,

18:52.714 --> 18:53.966
-I thought I made it...
-Hey.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.134
It's the poo man.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.635
And he's picking poo.

18:57.386 --> 18:58.887
Oh, no.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.390
Jimmy Wichard? What's going on?

19:01.473 --> 19:02.933
He's one of the Mashers.

19:03.016 --> 19:04.059
The Mashers?

19:04.143 --> 19:05.561
Oh, I'm afraid so.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.062
They're just one group of many

19:07.146 --> 19:09.356
who take pleasure in hurting guys
who do what I do.

19:10.023 --> 19:12.568
But I thought you were the only one
who does this.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.279
I am, which is why
I get the crap beaten out of me

19:15.362 --> 19:16.780
on a fairly regular basis.

19:16.905 --> 19:19.199
-You do?
-It goes with the territory.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.577
You should know, Bobby,
it's not an easy life.

19:24.538 --> 19:25.664
Do I do it now?

19:29.459 --> 19:31.336
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

19:33.046 --> 19:36.091
Mm-hmm. Okay, we got to do it now.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.426
Let's get the poo man.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.886
Bobby.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.221
Call Sarah and tell her
it's happened again.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.642
Have mercy.

19:49.188 --> 19:53.025
-Oh, my God. Dad.
-Well, I'll be got danged.

20:00.616 --> 20:01.658
Get back in, you.

20:03.076 --> 20:04.286
Stop.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.747
Oh, dear God.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.540
Aah. Ooh.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.004
So, how was your visit with Peter?

20:14.087 --> 20:15.088
He's okay.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.758
Just a couple of broken bones
and some scrapes.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.426
He'll be out in a few days.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.887
Well, I'll say this about Peter Sterling.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.889
He's a pretty darn decent man.

20:24.181 --> 20:28.227
I can't believe people treat him that way
just because of what he does.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.312
Yep, it's kind of unfair,

20:30.395 --> 20:33.649
but that's how it is with most ways
of making big, easy money.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.568
It either gets you jail time
or your ass kicked.

20:36.652 --> 20:40.030
I'm, uh, sorry you had
to shut down your business.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.114
It's all right.

20:41.198 --> 20:44.243
My week with Peter gave me
an even better business idea.

20:44.451 --> 20:45.327
It did?

20:45.410 --> 20:48.997
Yep. Custom-fitted, monogrammed jumpsuits.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.832
You can wear them for almost anything,

20:50.916 --> 20:52.668
and they look really cool.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.002
Wouldn't you want one?

20:54.086 --> 20:55.128
Huh.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.838
I actually kind of would.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.135
So, uh, you still want to get that?

21:02.219 --> 21:04.096
Nah, not interested.

21:04.179 --> 21:05.722
It's all yours.

21:47.055 --> 21:49.349
