What do you want?

37:13.796 --> 37:16.669
I'm in town for a conference
and I heard you were here.

So I thought it would be nice
to stop and say hello.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.469
After you talk to God?

38:17.512 --> 38:21.647
You are not going to talk
to God because you're
not going to get to God.

38:21.690 --> 38:24.519
He will never
let you get to...Let me.

38:26.608 --> 38:28.001

Where is she?

39:46.819 --> 39:48.168
I released her.

39:48.211 --> 39:50.257
She's a goddamn lunatic.
