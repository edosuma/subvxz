00:09.927 --> 00:12.964
Maybe we don't have to kill him.
Maybe we can find another way.

00:13.097 --> 00:14.086
I might have just the thing.

00:14.223 --> 00:15.212
Why would I help you?

00:15.308 --> 00:17.765
The place I'm sending you,
among its residents,

00:17.894 --> 00:19.384
is your Prince Eric.

00:19.478 --> 00:22.015
You have a nice girl
waiting for you back in Storybrooke.

00:22.106 --> 00:23.095
Belle, is it?

00:26.485 --> 00:27.611
You have to stay here.

00:27.737 --> 00:30.149
No. Why? lwant to help.

00:30.281 --> 00:33.398
Greg and Tamara weren't
working alone. Others will follow.

00:34.452 --> 00:36.067
It's a cloaking spell.

00:36.954 --> 00:40.492
It will shield the town,
making it impossible for anyone to find.

find your way back to me?

00:53.804 --> 00:55.931
The boy is my undoing.

00:56.432 --> 00:58.297

01:47.024 --> 01:48.639
What happened? Where is everyone?

01:48.734 --> 01:50.270
They stopped the self-destruct device.

01:50.361 --> 01:53.319
Those people who came,
Greg and Tamara,

01:53.739 --> 01:56.856
they kidnapped Henry
and they took him through a portal.

01:57.785 --> 01:58.945
A portal to where?

01:59.036 --> 02:02.028
I don't know. Everyone else
followed them on Hook's ship.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.535
Why did you stay behind?

02:07.461 --> 02:08.541
Because I had to.

02:22.310 --> 02:25.643
It's a cloaking spell. Why?

02:25.730 --> 02:26.845
Because Rumple said...

02:27.857 --> 02:29.563
He said others were coming.

He did say they were working
with the people

03:01.098 --> 03:02.679

03:02.767 --> 03:03.927
Can we panic now?

03:04.018 --> 03:05.974
Yeah. Sure. Maybe, just a little.

We'll be fine as long

We just need to open up a vein

13:02.824 --> 13:06.442
The fact that they both have feelings
for you is dangerous, too.

13:09.373 --> 13:10.408
None of that matters.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.748
All I care about is getting my son back.

13:13.835 --> 13:14.915
There you are.

13:15.921 --> 13:17.377
Care to take a stroll?

13:17.547 --> 13:19.924
There's someplace special
I'd like to show you.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.248
I'm not going anywhere with you.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.634
(SIGHS) Why not, Henry?

13:25.305 --> 13:26.465
I think you're lying to me.

13:26.807 --> 13:30.425
My family, they're here.
On Neverland. I know it.

13:30.519 --> 13:31.804
What makes you so sure?

13:31.895 --> 13:33.010
Does it matter?

13:34.231 --> 13:36.222
No. It doesn't.

13:36.525 --> 13:38.982
But I'd be remiss
if I didn't point out what does.

13:39.486 --> 13:43.445
If your family is here, Henry,
why haven't they come for you?

13:49.246 --> 13:50.577
Maybe you're keeping them from me.

13:51.123 --> 13:53.239
(WHISPERS) Henry, I promise you,

13:53.625 --> 13:56.002
I'm not holding your family prisoner.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.502
Then why do you keep
disappearing into the jungle?

13:58.588 --> 14:01.830
You're hiding something from me,
and I'm gonna find out what it is.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.085
FELIX: It would appear
we're losing the boy.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.388
He just requires some effort.

14:11.309 --> 14:14.221
Given his lineage,
I'd expect nothing less.

14:14.312 --> 14:15.597
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

14:15.772 --> 14:17.478
Shall I bring the cage here?

14:17.566 --> 14:18.681
No.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.479
I have another idea.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.653
Something tells me we won't find
Pan's Shadow in here, mate.

14:25.741 --> 14:28.448
Yeah, we're looking for something else.
It's a coconut that's carved in two.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.275
One part holds a candle,
the other part goes on top...

14:30.370 --> 14:32.201
Yeah, your star map.
We hid it. I'll go grab it.

14:34.041 --> 14:37.329
I owe you thanks
for being so understanding.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.496
Understanding about what?

14:43.175 --> 14:44.460
Emma and me.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.758
Emma and you?

14:47.012 --> 14:48.127
Our dalliance.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.506
You don't know, do you?

14:55.437 --> 14:56.472
Well, this is awkward.

14:57.147 --> 15:00.514
The two of us shared a kiss.
Apologies, I assumed she told you.

15:03.779 --> 15:06.395
Honestly, it probably slipped her mind.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.654
We're kind of focused
on getting our son back.

15:09.284 --> 15:10.319
Of course.

15:10.619 --> 15:11.779
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)

15:15.707 --> 15:16.947
Everything all right?

15:18.085 --> 15:19.120
Couldn't be better.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.167
Here it is. Your star map.

15:21.797 --> 15:23.003
NEAL: It's not a star map.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.955
It's what we're gonna use
to trap Pan's Shadow.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.631
A coconut? Are you daft?

15:26.718 --> 15:28.834
You came to Neverland
on a pirate ship through a portal,

15:28.929 --> 15:30.169
but you draw the line
at a magic coconut?

15:30.263 --> 15:33.380
Fair enough.
What's our next stop on this mission?

15:34.851 --> 15:36.466
Dark Hollow.

15:36.561 --> 15:37.892
EMMA: Really?

15:37.979 --> 15:41.312
Why couldn't it be called something like
Sunshine Valley or Rainbow Cove?

15:42.400 --> 15:43.776
What exactly is it?

15:43.860 --> 15:46.476
Just what it sounds like.
The darkest spot on the entire island.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.608
Any light that makes its way in
is snuffed out

15:48.698 --> 15:51.075
by the shadows that call it home.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.025
Even I manage to avoid it.

15:53.245 --> 15:57.033
Well, time to break tradition.
Dark Hollow it is.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.035
That's where we're gonna find
Pan's Shadow, right?

15:59.126 --> 16:02.209
Yeah, it's the only way
we'll ever get back to Storybrooke.

16:07.634 --> 16:08.749
ARIEL: Look at this stuff.

16:08.844 --> 16:11.381
Yeah. He's a (CHUCKLES)
bit of a collector.

16:13.557 --> 16:15.172
-This is a...
-Corkscrew.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.807
But it's not what Rumple needs.

16:23.358 --> 16:24.393
It's a...

16:25.569 --> 16:27.150
A button.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.402
Also not what he needs.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.650
No, I know. But Eric...

16:32.159 --> 16:35.401
He had one just like it on his jacket
when I rescued him.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.826
And Eric is...

16:36.913 --> 16:39.495
He's a prince. The kind with legs.

16:39.583 --> 16:40.572
(LAUGHS)

16:41.126 --> 16:45.745
I fell in love with him a long time ago,
but it didn't work out.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.253
Because you're a mermaid?

16:47.465 --> 16:48.625
Something like that.

16:49.593 --> 16:52.255
Well, that's just one more reason
that we need to succeed.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.334
(CHUCKLES)

16:53.680 --> 16:57.218
So Rumple said
I'd find the hiding space

16:57.309 --> 16:59.015
with the strength of our love.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.231
Ah.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.234
There's only one thing
he could've been talking about.

17:10.197 --> 17:11.687
-That's a...
-Tea cup.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.440
-It's chipped.
-I know.

17:15.118 --> 17:17.074
But no matter how much
this thing has been through,

17:17.162 --> 17:18.527
it's survived.

17:18.622 --> 17:19.737
Just like our love.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.614
So what now?

17:23.126 --> 17:25.458
-Do we make tea?
-l'm not sure.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.705
Rumple used to keep it in here.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.631
(TINKLING)

17:41.978 --> 17:43.559
(WHOOSH)

17:45.023 --> 17:47.355
He enchanted it. It's a key.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.358
(BELLE GASPS)

17:55.033 --> 17:56.148
(GASPS)

17:56.660 --> 17:58.196
ARIEL: It's a box.

17:58.870 --> 18:02.829
I've read about this in my books,
but I didn't realize it was real.

18:02.958 --> 18:05.324
-Or that Rumple had it.
-What is it?

18:05.418 --> 18:06.999
It's Pandora's box.

18:07.087 --> 18:11.330
Legend says it contains
the world's darkest evil.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.086
Shouldn't you be wearing gloves
or something?

18:14.469 --> 18:16.835
No. As long as
we don't open it, we're fine.

18:17.514 --> 18:18.503
Oh.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.974
Yeah. Sure.

18:20.642 --> 18:22.052
So what do you think is inside of it?

18:22.852 --> 18:27.516
Well, whatever it is, it's what Rumple's
gonna use to defeat Pan.

18:27.899 --> 18:28.888
-(CHUCKLES)
-(GUNS COCK)

18:30.610 --> 18:32.475
All that trouble for a box?

18:32.988 --> 18:34.023
Who are you?

18:34.114 --> 18:36.355
The people you tried
to keep out of Storybrooke.

18:40.662 --> 18:41.822
(BELLE AND ARIEL GRUNT)

18:43.748 --> 18:45.284
Stay still.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.832
I don't understand. Why do we
keep doing what he tells us?

18:48.128 --> 18:49.538
Because he has a gun.

18:49.629 --> 18:50.709
What's a gun?

18:50.797 --> 18:52.458
Trust me, you don't want to find out.

19:05.687 --> 19:08.099
What did Rumplestiltskin
tell you about this thing?

19:08.189 --> 19:10.145
I'm not afraid of you or your gun.

19:10.525 --> 19:12.481
And notjust because
I don't know what it is.

19:12.569 --> 19:13.558
Shall we demonstrate?

19:14.571 --> 19:16.778
The box. What is it?

19:18.199 --> 19:19.405
It's magic.

19:19.784 --> 19:23.117
Which you're only gonna destroy,
anyway. So why do you even care?

19:23.371 --> 19:25.362
Because our boss wants to know.

19:25.457 --> 19:28.915
Your boss? (LAUGHS) You don't
even know what this is all about.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.789
-Or who you're really working for.
-Peter Pan.

19:32.005 --> 19:32.994
What?

19:33.173 --> 19:36.836
Yes. We know exactly
who we're working for.

19:36.926 --> 19:37.961
But Rumple said that...

19:38.053 --> 19:39.839
Greg and Tamara didn't know.

19:40.305 --> 19:42.261
They were patsies.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.298
We, on the other hand,
are aware of our real mission.

19:45.393 --> 19:46.428
Which is what?

19:46.519 --> 19:48.259
Seeing that your Rumple fails.

19:48.772 --> 19:52.356
And that this thing
never makes it back to Neverland.

19:54.444 --> 19:57.527
Head to the other side of the island
and deliver the supplies.

19:58.907 --> 20:00.022
Understood.

20:02.202 --> 20:03.282
Anything else?

20:04.662 --> 20:07.950
Just be certain Henry doesn't find out
what you're up to.

20:35.193 --> 20:36.433
-Here.
-I'm okay.

20:36.778 --> 20:38.018
Are you?

20:38.238 --> 20:40.729
Because you've hardly said
two words to me since the Caves.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.238
Hell, since yesterday.

20:43.034 --> 20:45.525
Look, I know you're upset
I didn't tell you I was poisoned.

20:45.662 --> 20:48.278
And even though
it might seem like it wasn't fair,

20:48.373 --> 20:51.490
that's all I was trying to do. Be fair.

20:54.129 --> 20:57.087
I think Tinker Bell's is that way.

cut our way through.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.351
Here. Use this.

21:13.982 --> 21:15.062
My cutlass?

21:16.151 --> 21:17.186
You find it in the cave?

21:17.360 --> 21:18.861
No, actually, Hook gave it to me.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.438
Since when are you sentimental?

21:20.780 --> 21:23.988
I thought Emma would wish to have
something to remember you by.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.736
Oh. Thanks. She's got me now.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.071
What was that about?

21:29.164 --> 21:30.153
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

21:30.415 --> 21:32.952
I assumed he had heard my secret.

21:34.252 --> 21:36.868
I also assumed that you'd told him
about our shared moment.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.499
Why would you assume that?

21:38.590 --> 21:40.296
Because I was hoping
it meant something.

21:40.383 --> 21:44.001
What meant something was that
you told us Neal was still alive.

21:45.180 --> 21:46.636
Thank you.

21:47.265 --> 21:49.631
I realize you could've kept
Pan's information to yourself.

21:50.393 --> 21:52.759
-Why would I have done that?
-I don't know.

21:52.854 --> 21:55.596
Maybe Pan offered you a deal.
Why else would he tell you?

21:55.690 --> 21:57.100
It was a test.

21:57.192 --> 21:59.308
He wanted to see
if I'd leave an old friend to die.

21:59.402 --> 22:02.735
Even if the old friend happens to be
vying for the same woman I am.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.522
And you chose your friend.

22:06.493 --> 22:07.778
Does that surprise you?

22:07.869 --> 22:09.780
You are a pirate.

22:10.330 --> 22:11.695
Yeah, that I am.

22:14.042 --> 22:15.998
But I also believe in good form.

22:17.420 --> 22:20.287
So when I win your heart, Emma,

22:21.549 --> 22:23.414
and Iwill win it,

22:23.510 --> 22:25.421
it will not be because of any trickery.

22:26.888 --> 22:28.549
It will be because you want me.

22:31.434 --> 22:33.049
(WHISPERS)
This is not a contest, Hook.

22:33.144 --> 22:34.259
Isn't it?

22:34.687 --> 22:37.599
You're gonna have to choose, Emma.
You realize that, don't you?

22:37.690 --> 22:39.976
Because neither one of us
is gonna give up.

22:40.068 --> 22:43.435
The only thing I have to choose
is the best way to get my son back.

22:43.530 --> 22:44.861
And you will.

22:44.948 --> 22:46.279
You think so?

wears off this bracelet,

so they can't leave Storybrooke.

How do you destroy
something so powerful?

25:07.590 --> 25:09.046
You'd need something just as strong.

25:09.467 --> 25:10.752

25:11.386 --> 25:12.421
No.

No, a dwarf's pickaxe.

25:15.223 --> 25:16.884

25:16.974 --> 25:20.637

Henry, used to start all this trouble.

25:20.728 --> 25:22.593

25:23.398 --> 25:26.515
I think we're almost at Tink's.

25:28.903 --> 25:30.689
I can see why she picked this area.

25:31.823 --> 25:33.529

25:34.826 --> 25:37.693

25:44.585 --> 25:47.418
Snow. When are you going to
start talking to me again?

25:48.089 --> 25:50.876
When we're storming Pan's camp?
When we're grabbing Henry? When?

25:50.967 --> 25:53.083
You need to say something.

25:57.348 --> 25:58.383
VVhy?

25:58.474 --> 26:01.511
You didn't. You didn't tell me anything.

26:01.602 --> 26:04.469
At first I was hoping that
I could find a cure for the poison.

26:04.564 --> 26:07.055
And if I could, then I figured
there was no reason to worry you.

26:07.150 --> 26:11.484
Okay. But then you did find a cure,
and you still didn't tell me.

26:11.571 --> 26:12.777
-I know.
-So what?

26:12.864 --> 26:14.570
-Afraid to worry me again?
-No. I... (STAMMERS)

26:14.657 --> 26:16.272
NO. You didn't think.

26:16.367 --> 26:19.985
You didn't think I had a right to know
that you can never leave this island?

26:20.496 --> 26:22.236
Why didn't you tell me?

26:22.331 --> 26:23.411
I was scared.

26:25.126 --> 26:27.208
Did you think
I wouldn't stay here with you?

26:28.004 --> 26:29.494
After everything we've been through?

26:30.131 --> 26:32.122
Did you think
I would ever leave your side?

26:32.216 --> 26:34.673
No. I knew you wouldn't.
That's what scared me.

26:34.844 --> 26:36.004
And I didn't want that for you.

26:36.220 --> 26:39.383
I didn't want you to be
stuck on this island with me.

26:39.474 --> 26:42.386
The price of this cure was something
I didn't want to force on you.

26:42.477 --> 26:45.969
-Love means being together.
-I know. It also means sacrifice.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.228

How could a part of me
not want you to leave this place?

26:51.569 --> 26:53.776
I would happily build a tree house

26:53.863 --> 26:55.728
and spend the rest of my days

26:55.823 --> 27:00.112
dodging poison arrows and Lost Boys
as long as I had you by my side.

27:03.164 --> 27:04.449
But you should have told me.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.792
(WHISPERS) I know. I'm sorry.

Belle doesn't want to let them down.

38:14.668 --> 38:16.875
She wants you to make sure
that Wendy is okay.

38:17.754 --> 38:19.710
All that matters is Henry.

38:20.132 --> 38:22.498
ARIEL: And now you have a chance
to save him.

38:22.593 --> 38:24.174
Thanks to me and Belle.

38:24.261 --> 38:26.877
So rescuing that girl
is the least that you can do.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.212
We'll do our best.

38:28.307 --> 38:29.422
(EXHALES)

38:30.934 --> 38:31.969
Look, um,

38:34.897 --> 38:35.932
when you return,

38:37.941 --> 38:39.351
tell Belle I love her.

38:39.526 --> 38:41.266
And that she was right.

38:42.613 --> 38:43.819
I will see her again.

38:55.250 --> 38:56.660
Hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry.
I know I screwed up.

38:56.752 --> 38:57.832
Yes, you did.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.035
You both did.

38:59.129 --> 39:00.460
We almost lost our shot
at capturing the Shadow

39:00.547 --> 39:02.333
because you two
were fighting over a lighter.

39:02.424 --> 39:04.881
It wasn't the lighter
we were fighting over, love.

39:04.968 --> 39:06.253
Okay.

39:06.345 --> 39:08.085
Let me be very clear about something.

39:08.180 --> 39:09.795
If I had to choose someone,

39:11.767 --> 39:13.382
I choose Henry.

39:14.144 --> 39:15.805
He's the only love
I have room for in my life.

39:25.155 --> 39:26.656
(FOLIAGE RUSTLING)

39:29.576 --> 39:31.032
I was wondering if I'd see you again.

39:31.995 --> 39:33.610
But if you've come to
talk me into helping you

39:33.705 --> 39:35.161
before you've found a way
off this island, I still...

39:35.249 --> 39:37.456
We found one. Or we're about to.

39:37.668 --> 39:39.408
I'm not sure I like
the sound of "about to."

39:39.586 --> 39:41.087
Pan's Shadow.

39:41.171 --> 39:42.502
Emma went with Hook and Neal
to capture it.

39:42.589 --> 39:44.420
That's our way off the island.

39:44.508 --> 39:45.873
Capture Pan's Shadow?

39:45.968 --> 39:48.835
Yeah, I'm not lifting a finger until I see
some proof you've actually succeeded.

39:48.929 --> 39:50.920
Hey. (PANTING)

39:53.225 --> 39:54.931
Here's all the proof you need.

39:55.352 --> 39:57.138
Been a long time, Tink.

39:57.729 --> 40:00.846
-Bae, is it really you?
-Yeah.

40:01.942 --> 40:03.603
Most people call me Neal now.

40:04.695 --> 40:06.231
We did it.

40:06.321 --> 40:09.404
Are you finally ready
to do your part, Tink?

40:12.452 --> 40:14.909
Yes. Yes, I am.

40:19.126 --> 40:20.457
Uh, Emma.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.201
Neal.

40:22.296 --> 40:25.083
Listen, I just wanted to tell you
that you're right.

40:26.675 --> 40:28.791
About Henry. He is all that matters.

40:28.885 --> 40:30.876
And if he's the only thing
that came from us being together?

40:32.306 --> 40:35.093
-I'd say we did all right.
-Yeah.

40:37.060 --> 40:38.891
Now let's go get our son back.

40:47.279 --> 40:48.815
PAN: Why so glum, chum?

40:54.328 --> 40:55.909
You said you weren't
keeping any secrets.

40:57.581 --> 40:58.787
But you lied.

40:59.708 --> 41:01.949
-I found Wendy.
-Henry, I can explain.

41:02.127 --> 41:03.162
She's dying, isn't she?

41:03.962 --> 41:05.247
I'm afraid she is.

41:05.756 --> 41:06.836
Like much of the island,

41:07.007 --> 41:09.794
because the magic here
is slipping away.

41:09.885 --> 41:11.625
I would've told you,

41:11.720 --> 41:14.382
but I didn't want you to have
that weight on your shoulders.

41:14.473 --> 41:17.180
Knowing that a young girl's life
depends on you.

41:20.771 --> 41:23.478
So I'm the only one
who can save magic?

41:24.608 --> 41:25.848
You are.

41:30.072 --> 41:31.187
How do I do it?

41:31.698 --> 41:33.404
The question isn't how, Henry.

41:34.409 --> 41:35.660
It's where.

41:35.744 --> 41:37.109
Follow me.

41:46.046 --> 41:47.331
See that?

41:48.757 --> 41:50.338
HENRY: Is that Skull Rock?

41:50.842 --> 41:51.877
PAN: Yes.

41:52.719 --> 41:54.960
Inside is where our salvation awaits.

41:55.806 --> 41:59.344
A salvation that only the heart
of the truest believer can bring.

41:59.685 --> 42:00.765
Me?

42:00.852 --> 42:03.184
That's right, Henry.
But I won't lie to you.

42:03.897 --> 42:05.262
It won't be easy.

42:06.274 --> 42:09.607
It will require heroism and sacrifice.

42:10.320 --> 42:11.560
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

42:11.655 --> 42:15.489
The only question is,
are you up to the task?

42:22.290 --> 42:23.370
Yes.
