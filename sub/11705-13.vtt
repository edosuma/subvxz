{\an8}â™ª I REPRESENT MYSELF â™ª

15:12.411 --> 15:14.663
{\an8}â™ª I STARTED THIS WHOLE G.T.L. â™ª
- I'M JUST HAVING FUN RIGHT NOW.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.248
{\an8}I'M ON THE STRIPPER POLE.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.791
{\an8}I'M SHAKING MY BOOTY,

15:17.875 --> 15:19.543
{\an8}MEETING GUYS,
DANCING,

15:19.627 --> 15:21.128
{\an8}YOU KNOW, JUST DOING IT ALL.

15:21.211 --> 15:22.129
{\an8}- TONIGHT IS A FUN NIGHT.

15:22.212 --> 15:24.965
{\an8}YOU KNOW, THERE'S CHICKS
EVERYWHERE.

15:26.383 --> 15:27.926
{\an8}THESE TWO GIRLS ARE, LIKE,
ALL OVER ME.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.012
{\an8}AND THEY'RE SAYING THE CRAZIEST
STUFF TO ME THAT, YOU KNOW,

15:30.095 --> 15:31.263
{\an8}GIRLS DON'T USUALLY SAY
TO GUYS.

15:40.689 --> 15:41.774
{\an8}AND THEY'RE OKAY.

15:41.857 --> 15:43.567
{\an8}THEY'RE NOT THE PRETTIEST GIRLS
IN THE WORLD,

15:43.651 --> 15:45.027
{\an8}BUT SOMETIMES YOU MIX
TWO GRENADES,

15:45.110 --> 15:46.987
{\an8}IT MIGHT MAKE
ONE GOOD-LOOKING GIRL.

15:58.957 --> 16:00.042
{\an8}I DEFINITELY WAS THINKING
ABOUT RAMONA

16:00.125 --> 16:04.588
{\an8}WHEN, YOU KNOW,
THESE HOS WERE ALL OVER ME.

16:07.132 --> 16:09.843
{\an8}WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE
A GOOD GIRL OUT THERE,

16:09.927 --> 16:11.095
{\an8}SAY NO TO HOS.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.556
{\an8}- I'M PROUD OF VINNY
FOR COMING INTO HIS OWN.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.557
{\an8}BUT GUESS WHAT, BABY.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.810
{\an8}IT'S A CAROUSEL,

16:17.893 --> 16:20.229
{\an8}AND THAT'S TWO GIRLS,
ME, AND LOTS OF FUN.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.355
{\an8}- THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO.

16:21.438 --> 16:22.606
{\an8}THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO. GOOD.

16:22.690 --> 16:23.941
{\an8}- AND THAT'S CALLED
A THREESOME, OKAY?

16:24.024 --> 16:26.777
{\an8}THAT'S A SITUATION-SOME, OKAY?

16:36.954 --> 16:39.373
{\an8}THREE MINUTES LATER, GUESS WHAT.
I'M IN THE BATHROOM,

16:39.456 --> 16:42.292
{\an8}GETTING...

16:42.376 --> 16:43.836
{\an8}YEAH.

16:49.675 --> 16:50.759
{\an8}I'D LIKE TO GIVE A TROPHY

16:50.843 --> 16:52.803
{\an8}TO THE PERSON
WHO DID THE LEAST IN THIS HOUSE.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.930
{\an8}- WHO GIVES A [bleep]?
- ALL RIGHT.

16:55.013 --> 16:55.723
{\an8}WELL, YOU'RE IN THE RUNNING.

16:55.806 --> 16:58.392
{\an8}MOST LIKELY TO GET SKIN CANCER.

16:58.475 --> 16:59.768
{\an8}- OOH.
- THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.896
{\an8}- THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
- I'LL HAVE TO NOMINATE MYSELF.

17:02.980 --> 17:03.105
{\an8}[laughter]

17:11.780 --> 17:13.490
{\an8}- WAKE UP, SITUATION.

17:13.574 --> 17:17.786
{\an8}WE'RE GONNA DO ALL OUR ERRANDS--
THE GYM, ALL THAT [bleep].

17:20.372 --> 17:22.374
{\an8}- LIKE, WHAT IS THAT?

17:24.710 --> 17:25.794
{\an8}TODAY'S THE SECOND-TO-LAST DAY,

17:25.877 --> 17:29.173
{\an8}AND I WANTED TO BE
AT THE BEACH.

17:29.256 --> 17:30.507
{\an8}EW.

17:30.591 --> 17:34.428
{\an8}I WANTED TO BE ANYWHERE ELSE
BESIDES CLEANING THE FRIDGE

17:34.511 --> 17:35.804
{\an8}TO THE POINT WHERE
I'M ALMOST VOMITING.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.432
{\an8}WHEN DID I GET THIS JOB
IN THE HOUSE?

17:38.515 --> 17:41.310
{\an8}BUT BEING PART OF A FAMILY
IS TAKING ONE FOR THE TEAM.

17:41.393 --> 17:44.980
{\an8}THERE IS DECAYING FOOD

17:45.063 --> 17:47.816
{\an8}LEFT OVER FROM VINNY'S MOM
BEING THERE.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.652
{\an8}THERE'S ACTUALLY SPILLED--
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.488
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE A SLAVE
TO THIS KITCHEN.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.072
{\an8}HOW OLD IS THAT?

17:54.156 --> 17:56.658
{\an8}I THREW OUT TWO BAGS OF GARBAGE
WORTH OF [bleep]

17:56.742 --> 17:57.826
{\an8}THAT WAS INSIDE THE FRIDGE.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.537
{\an8}I JUST HATE CLEANING UP
AFTER SEVEN PEOPLE.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.414
{\an8}THIS IS JUST PATHETIC.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.333
{\an8}I AM NOT [bleep]
ANY OF MY ROOMMATES,

18:04.416 --> 18:06.919
{\an8}THEREFORE I SHOULD NOT BE
CLEANING UP AFTER THEIR [bleep].

18:07.002 --> 18:08.587
{\an8}UGH.

18:11.924 --> 18:16.220
{\an8}- DOING THE NASTY
IN THE JACUZZI.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.681
{\an8}- I HEARD
YOU'RE COOKING, SNOOKS.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.017
{\an8}- WHOEVER SAID I SHOULD COOK,
THEY'RE OUT OF THEIR MIND.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.019
{\an8}IF YOU WANT ME TO COOK
AND POISON EVERYBODY

18:24.102 --> 18:26.396
{\an8}AND WE'RE GONNA BE DEAD
IN TWO MINUTES, WHATEVER.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.148
{\an8}I'M GONNA TELL SAM
TO HELP ME COOK.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.650
{\an8}- BY THE TIME WE GET BACK,
MY GRANDMA--

18:29.733 --> 18:32.194
{\an8}- SAMANTHA!

18:32.277 --> 18:35.114
{\an8}WILL YOU HELP ME
COOK TACOS?

18:37.157 --> 18:38.200
{\an8}- NICOLE!

18:38.283 --> 18:38.742
{\an8}- WAIT, IF IT'S--
SNOOK, COME HERE.

18:38.826 --> 18:39.952
{\an8}- THAT'S RIGHT.

18:40.035 --> 18:42.621
{\an8}- STOP POUTING.
COME HERE.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.418
{\an8}- SAM DOESN'T WANT
TO HELP ME.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.546
{\an8}- I'LL HELP YOU, SNOOKS.

18:50.629 --> 18:51.713
{\an8}- NO.
NO BOYS CAN HELP.

18:51.797 --> 18:52.881
{\an8}IT'S GIRLS.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.383
{\an8}- BUT I NEVER COOK.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.051
{\an8}CAN I WATCH?

18:56.134 --> 18:57.970
{\an8}- IF YOU'RE NAKED.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.890
{\an8}- OH, THEY TALKING MAD [bleep]
ABOUT YOU IN THERE.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.852
{\an8}YOU BETTER GET IN THERE.
- WHO?

19:04.935 --> 19:07.229
{\an8}- EVERYBODY.
- TALKING [bleep] ABOUT WHO?

19:07.312 --> 19:09.565
{\an8}- ABOUT YOU.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.567
{\an8}- [laughs]

19:11.650 --> 19:13.402
{\an8}- MIKE'S DEFINITELY
A POT-STIRRER, YES.

19:13.485 --> 19:14.987
{\an8}HE LIKES TO CAUSE
A LOT OF PROBLEMS

19:15.070 --> 19:16.738
{\an8}AND THEN GO TAKE A NAP
AFTER HE DOES IT.

19:21.159 --> 19:22.286
{\an8}- JUST NICOLE?

19:22.369 --> 19:23.745
{\an8}- SNOOKI JUST SAID
YOU WON'T HELP

19:23.829 --> 19:24.997
{\an8}AND YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING
AND [bleep] LIKE THAT.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.999
{\an8}THAT'S ALL.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.086
{\an8}- WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME HELP, NICOLE?

19:31.169 --> 19:32.796
{\an8}- I WOULD.

19:32.880 --> 19:33.213
{\an8}- GREAT.
I'M HERE TO HELP YOU.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.885
{\an8}- YOU DON'T HAVE TO HELP ME
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

19:37.968 --> 19:40.888
{\an8}- I'M HELPING
'CAUSE I WANT TO.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.598
{\an8}- YOU'RE LYING.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.516
{\an8}- IF I DIDN'T WANT TO HELP YOU,
I WOULDN'T HELP YOU.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.517
{\an8}- SHE'S LIKE,
"OH, HEY, NICOLE,

19:45.601 --> 19:47.561
{\an8}I'M GONNA HELP YOU COOK
SOME TACOS."

19:47.644 --> 19:49.354
{\an8}LIKE, [bleep] SARCASTIC BITCH.

19:51.189 --> 19:53.734
{\an8}I WAS LIKE,
"WHO IS THIS GIRL?

19:53.817 --> 19:55.110
{\an8}WHAT IS WRONG WITH HER?"

19:55.193 --> 19:56.987
{\an8}- I'M SO EXCITED
TO HELP YOU RIGHT NOW.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.239
{\an8}- YEP, SO DON'T, SAM.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.282
{\an8}- I'M ACTUALLY FINE.

20:00.365 --> 20:03.577
{\an8}LIKE, DON'T QUESTION ME.
I'M HELPING YOU.

20:03.660 --> 20:04.912
{\an8}YOU WANT TO ACT LIKE THAT,

20:04.995 --> 20:06.663
{\an8}I'M GONNA HELP YOU,
BUT I'M GONNA BE A BITCH...

20:06.747 --> 20:08.624
{\an8}ON PURPOSE.

20:14.379 --> 20:15.339
{\an8}[door closes]

20:15.422 --> 20:17.591
{\an8}OKAY.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.134
{\an8}- DUDE, SHE [bleep] RUINS
MY MOOD.

20:19.217 --> 20:22.971
{\an8}WE WERE, LIKE, FRIENDS,
AND NOW SHE'S...

20:23.055 --> 20:25.515
{\an8}- "FRIENDS" IS A DEEP WORD.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.850
{\an8}- NO, WE WERE FRIENDS.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.685
{\an8}WE WERE.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.145
{\an8}EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE
FOR THAT GIRL...

20:30.228 --> 20:31.104
{\an8}- YEAH, NO [bleep].

20:31.188 --> 20:35.192
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD,
I'M SO ANGRY.

20:35.275 --> 20:36.485
{\an8}- DON'T LET HER GET TO YOU.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.737
{\an8}I'M IN THE SAME POSITION.
JUST DON'T.

20:38.820 --> 20:41.406
{\an8}- I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
A REASON WHY SHE'S LIKE THAT.

20:41.490 --> 20:42.783
{\an8}- SHE DOESN'T HAVE GIRLFRIENDS.

20:42.866 --> 20:44.493
{\an8}SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO ACT
WITH GIRLFRIENDS.

20:44.576 --> 20:45.494
{\an8}SHE DOESN'T KNOW.

20:45.577 --> 20:46.662
{\an8}- I GIVE SOMEONE
THE TIME OF DAY,

20:46.745 --> 20:48.538
{\an8}AND YOU'RE GONNA TREAT ME
LIKE THAT.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.998
{\an8}- NICOLE STILL TRIES
TO BE HER FRIEND.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.041
{\an8}LIKE, YOU'RE WORKING YOURSELF UP
TO GET UPSET,

20:51.124 --> 20:52.459
{\an8}BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY,

20:52.542 --> 20:55.545
{\an8}SAM DOESN'T GIVE TWO [bleep]
ABOUT YOU, SO WHY CARE?

20:55.629 --> 20:57.005
{\an8}LET'S GO BACK IN.

20:57.089 --> 21:01.510
{\an8}DON'T LET THIS RUIN YOU.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.637
{\an8}- DONE COOKING?
- ALMOST.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.597
{\an8}IF ANGELINA WAS HERE,
I'D GIVE HER THE BURNT ONE.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.933
{\an8}- IT'S READY.
- GIVE ME SALT.

21:08.016 --> 21:10.644
{\an8}- THE HAMBURGER MEAT LOOKS
LIKE VINNY'S CHEST HAIR.

21:10.727 --> 21:13.480
{\an8}[laughs]

21:13.563 --> 21:15.273
{\an8}LOOK WHAT WE FIRST STARTED
IN JERSEY.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.401
{\an8}WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW EACH OTHER.
EVERYBODY WAS PERFECT STRANGERS.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.819
{\an8}I MEAN,
NOW THE GIRLS COOKING DINNER.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.028
{\an8}LIKE, THIS IS CRAZY.
THIS IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.446
{\an8}- WE HAD SOME INTERESTING TIMES

21:21.530 --> 21:22.614
{\an8}HERE IN THIS HOUSE.
- YES, SIR.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.992
{\an8}I WILL GIVE RON
A COUPLE INTERESTING TIMES

21:25.075 --> 21:26.952
{\an8}IN THE FIRST WEEK OR TWO
HE WAS HERE--

21:27.035 --> 21:29.204
{\an8}A COUPLE
OF VERY INTERESTING TIMES.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.540
{\an8}RON GETS A COUPLE TROPHIES.

21:31.623 --> 21:32.416
{\an8}[laughs]

21:37.796 --> 21:39.006
{\an8}I'D LIKE TO GIVE A TROPHY

21:39.089 --> 21:41.383
{\an8}TO THE PERSON
WHO DID THE LEAST IN THIS HOUSE.

21:41.466 --> 21:42.551
{\an8}LET'S VOTE RIGHT NOW.

21:42.634 --> 21:43.301
{\an8}WHO DID THE LEAST
IN THIS HOUSE RIGHT NOW?

21:47.180 --> 21:48.515
{\an8}I'M VOTING FOR...

21:48.598 --> 21:52.561
{\an8}IT IS A TIE BETWEEN...
- WHO GIVES A [bleep]?

21:52.644 --> 21:54.563
{\an8}- I WASN'T GONNA SAY YOU.
- I DON'T CARE.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.273
{\an8}YOU COULD SAY ME.

21:56.356 --> 21:56.857
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT,
WELL, YOU'RE IN THE RUNNING.

21:56.940 --> 21:58.817
{\an8}- THAT'S WEIRD.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.278
{\an8}- WAIT, WHAT?

22:01.361 --> 22:04.072
{\an8}THIS--THIS IS ALL
IN HARMLESS FUN.

22:04.156 --> 22:07.451
{\an8}EVERYBODY
CHILL THE [bleep] OUT.

22:07.534 --> 22:09.536
{\an8}- YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT
TO ME RIGHT NOW.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.413
{\an8}I'M HAPPY.
- [laughs]

22:11.496 --> 22:12.789
{\an8}- MIKE IS A LUNATIC,
AND HE CAUSES

22:12.873 --> 22:15.667
{\an8}A LOT OF ISSUES
IN THIS HOUSE ON PURPOSE.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.295
{\an8}BUT IT MAKES ME LAUGH,
BECAUSE I'M OVER IT.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.592
{\an8}- NAH, 'CAUSE...

22:27.179 --> 22:29.431
{\an8}- ALL I SAID TO HIM--
ALL I--

22:29.514 --> 22:32.768
{\an8}I SAID I'M UPSET WITH YOU.
- WITH ME?

22:32.851 --> 22:33.852
{\an8}HOW THE [bleep]
DID I CALL YOU FAKE?

22:33.935 --> 22:36.021
{\an8}- THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.
- FROM WHO?

22:36.104 --> 22:37.397
{\an8}- [shrieks]
- YOUS ARE ALL [bleep] NUTS!

22:47.282 --> 22:47.783
{\an8}- OUR LAST NIGHT.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.077
{\an8}- I LOVE YOU.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.704
{\an8}WE JUST HAD THE MOST AWKWARD
DINNER I HAVE EVER HAD

22:52.788 --> 22:53.955
{\an8}IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

22:54.039 --> 22:56.458
{\an8}LIKE, HONESTLY, IT'S OUR
LAST NIGHT IN THE HOUSE.

22:56.541 --> 22:57.876
{\an8}LET'S JUST HAVE A GOOD TIME.

22:57.959 --> 22:59.795
{\an8}-<i> SALUTE.</i>

{\an8}- LAST NIGHT HERE.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.925
{\an8}WE ARE GONNA DO
A GAME OF SOME SORT.

23:05.008 --> 23:06.134
{\an8}- WHAT KIND OF GAME?

23:06.218 --> 23:07.761
{\an8}- YOU KNOW, LIKE,
WHEN YOU'RE IN A YEARBOOK

23:07.844 --> 23:10.013
{\an8}AND YOU WRITE OUT, LIKE,
MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED,

23:10.097 --> 23:14.142
{\an8}MOST LIKELY TO--YOUR SISTER,
MOST LIKELY TO THIS, TO THAT.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.978
{\an8}- HOW DO YOU SPELL LIKELY?

23:17.062 --> 23:18.355
{\an8}- WHO'S BEEN THE LIFE
OF THE PARTY THIS YEAR?

23:18.438 --> 23:21.108
{\an8}- THIS ONE'S ALWAYS DOWN
TO PARTY.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.192
{\an8}- MIKE HAD TO DRAG ME
OUT OF THE CLUB.

23:22.275 --> 23:24.236
{\an8}- IF YOU HAVE TO DRAG SOMEONE
OUT OF THE CLUB,

23:24.319 --> 23:26.947
{\an8}YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST [bleep]
GOING ALL OUT.

23:27.030 --> 23:28.782
{\an8}- MOST LIKELY
TO GET SKIN CANCER.

23:28.865 --> 23:30.408
{\an8}- OOH.

23:30.492 --> 23:31.660
{\an8}- THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.203
{\an8}TO NOMINATE MYSELF.
[laughter]

23:33.286 --> 23:35.247
{\an8}THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
- JUST 'CAUSE YOU HAD

23:35.330 --> 23:38.166
{\an8}A TANNING BED
IN YOUR HOUSE.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.837
{\an8}- WHO'S MOST LIKELY
TO BE A FOLLOWER?

23:41.920 --> 23:43.004
{\an8}- VINNY.
all: OOH.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.465
{\an8}- YOU HAVE TO SAY WHY.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.175
{\an8}- AH, 'CAUSE LAST YEAR

23:47.259 --> 23:49.511
{\an8}VINNY DIDN'T HANG OUT
WITH ME AND PAULY,

23:49.594 --> 23:51.680
{\an8}AND THIS YEAR
HE CONVENIENTLY...

23:51.763 --> 23:53.181
{\an8}- OKAY.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.517
{\an8}- MESHED IN WITH US,
AND HE DECIDED

23:55.600 --> 23:56.977
{\an8}THAT IT WAS A...
- [laughs]

23:57.060 --> 23:58.186
{\an8}DID THE ROBBERY
ON PAULY.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.855
{\an8}MIKE, YOU'RE JUST MAD

23:59.938 --> 24:02.399
{\an8}BECAUSE VINNY DID THE ROBBERY
ON YOUR BEST FRIEND PAULY.

24:02.482 --> 24:03.525
{\an8}I SAID IT STRAIGHT UP.

24:03.608 --> 24:05.110
{\an8}- YO, WHY YOU CALLING ME
A FOLLOWER, DOG?

24:05.193 --> 24:06.528
{\an8}THAT'S [bleep] UP.

24:06.611 --> 24:08.029
{\an8}- OH, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

24:08.113 --> 24:10.448
{\an8}- THAT'S [bleep] UP.
JUST 'CAUSE I G.T.L.?

24:10.532 --> 24:13.994
{\an8}LISTEN, LAST YEAR IN SEASIDE,
I DID G.T.L.

24:14.077 --> 24:15.245
{\an8}- YOU DIDN'T TAN, BRO!

24:15.328 --> 24:17.539
{\an8}- I DON'T FAKE-TAN.
I GO TO THE BEACH, [bleep].

24:17.622 --> 24:19.082
{\an8}- YOU [bleep] NOW,
[bleep] DON'T YOU?

24:19.166 --> 24:20.500
{\an8}- I SPRAY-TAN.
- OH, THAT'S EVEN MORE FAKE!

24:20.584 --> 24:23.587
{\an8}- HOW MANY TIMES
DID I GO INTO A SPRAY--A THING?

24:23.670 --> 24:24.713
{\an8}- TANOREXIC.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.673
{\an8}- WE ALL KNOW WHO THE FAKEST ONE
IN THE HOUSE IS.

24:26.756 --> 24:27.757
{\an8}- OH.

24:27.841 --> 24:28.967
{\an8}- OH, DAMN.

24:29.050 --> 24:30.886
{\an8}- OHH.
- YEAH.

24:30.969 --> 24:32.387
{\an8}- IT'S NOT COMING
FROM ME, SO...

24:32.471 --> 24:34.306
{\an8}- WELL, I'D LIKE SOMEBODY

24:34.389 --> 24:37.684
{\an8}TO ELABORATE,
WHOEVER IT CAME FROM.

24:37.767 --> 24:40.312
{\an8}- MIKE WAS REALLY GETTING HARD
ON VINNY

24:40.395 --> 24:41.855
{\an8}AND CALLING HIM FAKE
AND A FOLLOWER.

24:41.938 --> 24:43.273
{\an8}SO I JUST BLEW UP MIKE'S SPOT.

24:43.356 --> 24:44.691
{\an8}AND I'M LIKE,
"YOU'RE THE ONE ACTING FAKE,

24:44.774 --> 24:45.901
{\an8}AND IT'S NOT ME
THAT'S SAYING IT."

24:45.984 --> 24:51.072
{\an8}- I'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHO ALLEGEDLY OR IS SOME WAY

24:51.156 --> 24:52.532
{\an8}TALKING [bleep]
BEHIND MY BACK

24:52.616 --> 24:55.160
{\an8}WHO'S SUPPOSEDLY MY FRIEND
IN SOME WAY.

24:55.243 --> 24:56.411
{\an8}I'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHO DID IT.

24:56.494 --> 24:58.038
{\an8}YOU'RE GONNA TALK [bleep]
ABOUT ME THE LAST DAY?

24:58.121 --> 24:58.955
{\an8}AND THAT'S TYPICAL

24:59.039 --> 25:00.999
{\an8}OF SOMEBODY
TO DO THAT THE LAST DAY,

25:01.082 --> 25:02.751
{\an8}BECAUSE IF YOU DID IT
THE FIRST COUPLE WEEKS,

25:02.834 --> 25:04.085
{\an8}YOU WOULD BE ISOLATED.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.545
{\an8}I'M GLAD THAT [bleep] GOT
CLEARED UP THE LAST DAY,

25:05.629 --> 25:08.632
{\an8}WHO THE [bleep] FAKE PERSON
IN THE HOUSE IS.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.634
{\an8}IT'S NOT ANGELINA.
SHE'S NOT HERE.

25:10.717 --> 25:11.718
{\an8}IT'S [bleep] JENNI.

25:11.801 --> 25:14.930
{\an8}IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

25:15.013 --> 25:17.766
{\an8}SO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IT'S JUST--

25:17.849 --> 25:18.725
{\an8}- CAN WE CHANGE
THE SUBJECT, PLEASE?

25:18.808 --> 25:20.769
{\an8}- YEAH.
- MIKE IS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE,

25:20.852 --> 25:23.605
{\an8}BUT WE'RE NOT AS GOOD FRIENDS
AS HE THINKS.

25:23.688 --> 25:26.107
{\an8}SO WHEN HE TELLS ME STUFF
ABOUT JENNI,

25:26.191 --> 25:28.777
{\an8}HE THINKS I'M NOT GONNA
TELL HER, BUT, HELLO, GIRL CODE.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.820
{\an8}WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MY GIRL,
I'M GOING TO LET HER KNOW

25:30.904 --> 25:31.446
{\an8}WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

25:31.529 --> 25:32.322
{\an8}- WHAT'D I MISS?

25:32.405 --> 25:36.159
{\an8}- NOTHING.
- NOTHING.

25:40.288 --> 25:41.414
{\an8}- ARE WE GOING IN THE JACUZZI?
- YEAH.

25:41.498 --> 25:42.791
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

25:42.874 --> 25:46.419
{\an8}- IS THIS MY TOWEL OR YOURS?
- LET'S GO OUTSIDE.

25:47.879 --> 25:51.383
{\an8}AS OF RIGHT NOW, I WOULDN'T
TRUST ANYONE IN THE HOUSE.

25:51.466 --> 25:52.759
{\an8}- I HOPE I CAN TRUST YOU.

25:52.842 --> 25:53.635
{\an8}- I'LL TALK TO YOU
AFTER THIS.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.595
{\an8}- I'D LIKE TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

25:55.679 --> 25:58.890
{\an8}- JUST THE CONSENSUS
OF THE FAKEST IN THE HOUSE--

25:58.974 --> 26:00.934
{\an8}JENNI.

26:01.017 --> 26:03.603
{\an8}PAULY WAS LIKE...

26:03.687 --> 26:04.813
{\an8}- PAULY AND VINNY?

26:04.896 --> 26:06.982
{\an8}REALLY?

26:07.065 --> 26:08.817
{\an8}- LET'S GO MAKE A DRINK.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.902
{\an8}- NICOLE BASICALLY TELLS ME
MIKE WAS LIKE,

26:10.986 --> 26:12.654
{\an8}"THE MOST FAKE IN THE HOUSE
IS JENNI,"

26:12.737 --> 26:14.823
{\an8}THEN THAT PEOPLE WERE AGREEING.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.825
{\an8}AND THAT SET ME OFF.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.493
{\an8}- YOU GOTTA--
YOU GOTTA LET IT GO.

26:18.576 --> 26:20.662
{\an8}LET IT GO.
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

26:20.745 --> 26:23.498
{\an8}- SO [bleep] VINNY.
[Bleep] PAULY AT THIS POINT.

26:23.581 --> 26:24.791
{\an8}LIKE, I'M PISSED OFF.

26:24.874 --> 26:26.293
{\an8}COME WITH ME FOR A SECOND.

26:27.627 --> 26:29.254
{\an8}- WHAT UP?

26:29.337 --> 26:31.339
{\an8}- I GO CONFRONT MIKE,
AND I'M LIKE, "LISTEN.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.174
{\an8}"YOU KNOW,
YOU WANT TO CALL ME FAKE.

26:33.258 --> 26:34.843
{\an8}"WELL, THEN
YOUR BOY PAULY'S FAKE,

26:34.926 --> 26:37.637
{\an8}BECAUSE HE TALKED [bleep]
ABOUT YOU TO NICOLE."

26:37.721 --> 26:39.806
{\an8}WHO DO YOU THINK
SAID SOMETHING?

26:39.889 --> 26:43.059
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW.

26:43.143 --> 26:43.977
{\an8}PAULY?

26:44.060 --> 26:46.479
{\an8}I MEAN,
THAT'S VERY UPSETTING

26:46.563 --> 26:48.690
{\an8}FOR HIM TO EVEN--
FOR ME TO...

26:48.773 --> 26:49.733
{\an8}- BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

26:49.816 --> 26:52.319
{\an8}- I'M EXTREMELY UPSET
IF IT WAS HIM.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.951
{\an8}YO, I DON'T KNOW
WHY JENNI TOLD ME THIS,

27:00.035 --> 27:01.703
{\an8}BUT [bleep] JENNI--
JENNI JUST TOLD ME--

27:01.786 --> 27:02.579
{\an8}SHE'S LIKE, "YO, PAULY,
HE'S THE ONE."

27:02.662 --> 27:04.789
{\an8}- LIKE...
- ARE YOU BEING SERIOUS?

27:04.873 --> 27:06.499
{\an8}- THAT'S WHAT SHE JUST TOLD ME
TWO SECONDS AGO.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.585
{\an8}I'M JUST GONNA--
I'M JUST GONNA LEAVE IT ALONE.

27:08.668 --> 27:10.879
{\an8}- JENNI.

27:10.962 --> 27:12.589
{\an8}JENNI THINKS SHE HEARD ME
TALKING [bleep] ON MIKE,

27:12.672 --> 27:15.342
{\an8}AND NOW SHE'S BLOWING IT UP TO
SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

27:15.425 --> 27:16.384
{\an8}THAN WHAT IT ACTUALLY WAS.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.428
{\an8}I'M THE ONE
THAT RATTED OUT SITCH?

27:18.511 --> 27:20.930
{\an8}- NO.
- OH, MY GOD.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.223
{\an8}- SITCH JUST CAME OUT HERE
AND SAID THAT YOU SAID

27:22.307 --> 27:24.601
{\an8}THAT I RATTED HIM OUT.
- YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT.

27:24.684 --> 27:26.394
{\an8}AND I TOLD YOU THAT.
- I NEVER RATTED ANYBODY OUT

27:26.478 --> 27:27.896
{\an8}IN MY LIFE.
- NO, NO, NO.

27:27.979 --> 27:30.023
{\an8}YOU AND EVERYONE HERE SAID,

27:30.106 --> 27:31.107
{\an8}WHEN I WENT TO THE BATHROOM...
- OH, DEAR LORD.

27:31.191 --> 27:33.610
{\an8}- I'M FAKE.
- I SAID YOU'RE FAKE?

27:33.693 --> 27:34.569
{\an8}- YES.

27:34.652 --> 27:36.071
{\an8}- I NEVER SAID THAT.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.697
{\an8}- THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.
- SO YOU'RE GONNA TELL HIM

27:37.781 --> 27:38.656
{\an8}THAT I RATTED HIM OUT?
- THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.033
{\an8}- ARE YOU GONNA BREAK UP
A FRIENDSHIP?

27:40.116 --> 27:40.742
{\an8}- IT'S FUNNY
HOW JENNI REALLY DIDN'T GO,

27:40.825 --> 27:42.619
{\an8}"NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT."

27:42.702 --> 27:44.120
{\an8}SHE KIND OF WAS LIKE,
"WELL, YOU CALLED ME FAKE."

27:44.204 --> 27:45.955
{\an8}I DON'T THINK
PAULY WAS REALLY GETTING THAT

27:46.039 --> 27:47.749
{\an8}SHE WAS
KIND OF BRUSHING IT OFF.

27:47.832 --> 27:48.917
{\an8}- WHEN I WALKED AWAY...

27:49.000 --> 27:50.418
{\an8}- SO WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

27:50.502 --> 27:51.878
{\an8}- I DON'T WANT TO BRING IT UP.
- SNOOKS? WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

27:51.961 --> 27:54.589
{\an8}- I SAID WHEN I WALKED AWAY...
- BE REAL. BE REAL.

27:54.672 --> 27:56.132
{\an8}EVERYTHING'S OUT IN THE OPEN
RIGHT NOW. BE REAL.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.967
{\an8}EVERYBODY, BE REAL.

27:58.051 --> 28:00.011
{\an8}- PAULY, WHY ARE YOU SO MEAN
RIGHT NOW?

28:00.095 --> 28:01.596
{\an8}- BECAUSE SHE'S TRYING TO
[bleep] BREAK UP A FRIENDSHIP.

28:01.679 --> 28:03.098
{\an8}- I'M NOT TRYING
TO BREAK UP A FRIENDSHIP.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.016
{\an8}- I NEVER SAID HE WAS--
I NEVER [bleep] RATTED HIM OUT.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.184
{\an8}- I WALK AWAY, AND HE GOES,

28:06.267 --> 28:07.018
{\an8}"WHO'S THE FAKEST ONE
IN THE HOUSE?"

28:07.102 --> 28:08.770
{\an8}EVERYONE NODS
AND SAYS JENNI.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.355
{\an8}- OH, EVERYONE NODDED?
- THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

28:10.438 --> 28:11.314
{\an8}- YOU KNOW IT WASN'T ME,

28:11.398 --> 28:12.357
{\an8}BUT THEN YOU TOLD HIM--
YOU TOLD HIM--

28:12.440 --> 28:14.401
{\an8}- ALL I SAID TO HIM--

28:14.484 --> 28:16.778
{\an8}ALL I SAID TO HIM WAS--

28:16.861 --> 28:18.154
{\an8}I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH HIM.

28:18.238 --> 28:19.572
{\an8}I SAID I'M UPSET WITH YOU...
- WITH ME?

28:19.656 --> 28:22.033
{\an8}- BECAUSE I HEARD
THAT YOU CALLED ME FAKE.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.118
{\an8}- HOW THE [bleep]
DID I CALL YOU FAKE?

28:23.201 --> 28:25.161
{\an8}- THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.
- FROM WHO?

28:25.245 --> 28:26.496
{\an8}- [screams]

28:26.579 --> 28:27.747
{\an8}- I SAID THAT SHE'S FAKE?

28:27.831 --> 28:29.249
{\an8}- NO.
- ALL RIGHT, THEN!

28:29.332 --> 28:30.834
{\an8}WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOUS ARE ALL [bleep] NUTS!

28:35.255 --> 28:36.464
{\an8}- [crying] IT'S THE LAST NIGHT
IN THE HOUSE.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.882
{\an8}DO I REALLY WANT
TO HAVE PROBLEMS

28:37.966 --> 28:40.343
{\an8}WITH EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE?
- BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

28:40.427 --> 28:41.970
{\an8}- NOW I LOOK
LIKE A [bleep] DOUCHE BAG.

28:42.053 --> 28:44.806
{\an8}THIS IS RIDICULOUS THAT PEOPLE
ARE FIGHTING WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

28:44.889 --> 28:45.807
{\an8}I'M IN THE MOOD
TO GET THE [bleep] OUT.

28:53.064 --> 28:53.982
{\an8}- [screams]

28:54.065 --> 28:55.817
{\an8}- I SAID THAT SHE'S FAKE?
- NO!

28:55.900 --> 28:57.485
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, THEN!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

28:57.569 --> 28:59.362
{\an8}YOUS ARE ALL [bleep] NUTS!

29:02.157 --> 29:04.826
{\an8}I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S FAKE.
I DON'T RAT ANYBODY OUT.

29:04.909 --> 29:05.994
{\an8}I WOULD NEVER RAT OUT
MY BEST FRIEND.

29:06.077 --> 29:07.704
{\an8}- ALL I SAID WAS--
I JUST GO TO THE BATHROOM,

29:07.787 --> 29:10.081
{\an8}I HEAR
I'M GONNA GET MY ASS BEAT.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.583
{\an8}- WHAT'S THAT GOT
TO DO WITH ME?

29:11.666 --> 29:14.002
{\an8}- AND THEN I HEARD THAT PAULY
SAID THAT I WAS FAKE.

29:14.085 --> 29:15.378
{\an8}- THAT'S CRAZY
IF YOU WOULD SAY THAT.

29:15.462 --> 29:16.504
{\an8}- IT'S NOT CRAZY.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.338
{\an8}- I SAID SHE'S FAKE?
- NO.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.299
{\an8}- WHAT HAPPENED, THEN?

29:19.382 --> 29:20.842
{\an8}- CAN YOU NOT YELL AT ME
LIKE THAT?

29:20.925 --> 29:21.509
{\an8}YOU'RE SCARING THE [bleep]
OUT OF ME RIGHT NOW, PAULY.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.720
{\an8}- WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

29:23.803 --> 29:24.929
{\an8}LET'S GET [bleep] STRAIGHT
RIGHT NOW. WHAT HAPPENED?

29:25.013 --> 29:28.516
{\an8}- MIKE SAID A QUESTION,
"WHO IS FAKE IN THE HOUSE?"

29:28.600 --> 29:29.517
{\an8}- OKAY, WHO ANSWERED
THE QUESTION?

29:29.601 --> 29:31.478
{\an8}- MIKE DID.
- THANK YOU!

29:33.354 --> 29:35.648
{\an8}- IT'S A LITTLE SCARY,

29:35.732 --> 29:38.109
{\an8}'CAUSE PAULY--
HIS, LIKE, VEINS

29:38.193 --> 29:40.653
{\an8}WERE COMING OUT OF HIS,
LIKE, NECK AND HEAD.

29:40.737 --> 29:41.863
{\an8}- EVERYONE NODDED THEIR HEAD,

29:41.946 --> 29:43.281
{\an8}AND I WAS LIKE,
WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW?

29:43.364 --> 29:44.032
{\an8}- NOBODY NODDED THEIR HEAD.

29:44.115 --> 29:44.824
{\an8}- NOBODY NODDED THEIR HEAD!

29:44.908 --> 29:47.076
{\an8}- I NODDED MY HEAD TO JENNI?

29:47.160 --> 29:48.495
{\an8}- HE ANSWERED THE QUESTION.
- NO, NO.

29:48.578 --> 29:50.163
{\an8}- I NODDED MY HEAD TO HER?

29:50.246 --> 29:52.582
{\an8}- NO, WHEN MIKE SAID,
"WHO'S FAKE IN THE HOUSE?"

29:52.665 --> 29:53.500
{\an8}AND HE SAID, "JENNI,"

29:53.583 --> 29:57.045
{\an8}PEOPLE NODDED THEIR HEADS.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.796
{\an8}- AND I APOLOGIZED
TO HIM, AND I SAID,

29:58.880 --> 30:01.549
{\an8}"I AM PISSED OFF,"
BECAUSE I WAS WAITING

30:01.633 --> 30:02.842
{\an8}FOR YOU GUYS TO GET OUT.

30:02.926 --> 30:04.010
{\an8}- NOW YOU JUST SAID
THAT SNOOKI SAID

30:04.093 --> 30:05.136
{\an8}THAT I SAID
YOU WERE FAKE.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.638
{\an8}NOW SHE SAID
THAT SHE NEVER SAID THAT.

30:06.721 --> 30:08.389
{\an8}I'M JUST TRYING
TO CLEAR [bleep] UP.

30:08.473 --> 30:09.766
{\an8}- PRETTY MUCH
PAULY CALLED HER RIGHT OUT.

30:09.849 --> 30:11.976
{\an8}PAULY'S LIKE, "HOW DARE YOU
TRY TO BREAK UP

30:12.060 --> 30:13.895

{\an8}- THANK YOU.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.745

TO GO OUT LIKE THAT.

30:30.828 --> 30:32.247

{\an8}- I DIDN'T KNOW PAULY
WAS GONNA [bleep] BE THAT.

30:36.501 --> 30:39.003
{\an8}BECAUSE I AIRED IT OUT, NICOLE
THINKS I RUINED HER LAST NIGHT,

30:39.087 --> 30:40.838
{\an8}'CAUSE SHE THINKS THAT EVERYONE
HATES HER BECAUSE OF ME.

30:40.922 --> 30:43.424
{\an8}BUT THEN--
- NO, I'M VERY UPSET RIGHT NOW.

30:43.508 --> 30:44.634
{\an8}- BUT LOOK AT ME.

30:44.717 --> 30:46.010
{\an8}- [crying] IT'S THE LAST NIGHT
IN THE HOUSE.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.345
{\an8}DO I REALLY WANT
TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH EVERYBODY

30:47.428 --> 30:48.513
{\an8}IN THE HOUSE?
- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

30:48.596 --> 30:50.098
{\an8}WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

30:50.181 --> 30:52.433
{\an8}- SO STUPID.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.486
{\an8}- I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE ACTING LIKE THIS.

31:03.570 --> 31:05.613
{\an8}- NO, BECAUSE
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT, JENNI.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.907
{\an8}- HOW IS IT MY FAULT?
- BECAUSE.

31:07.991 --> 31:09.617
{\an8}- BECAUSE I APPROACHED THEM?

31:09.701 --> 31:11.494
{\an8}- NO, 'CAUSE YOU MADE ME
LOOK LIKE A [bleep] [bleep]

31:11.578 --> 31:13.037
{\an8}TO EVERYBODY.

31:13.121 --> 31:15.081
{\an8}- AND NOW I LOOK
LIKE THE [bleep] BAD GUY,

31:15.164 --> 31:16.249
{\an8}AND I'M NOT THE BAD GUY.

31:16.332 --> 31:17.667
{\an8}- YOU'RE NOT, THOUGH.
- I'M NOT.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.752
{\an8}BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU MADE ME
LOOK LIKE, JENNI.

31:19.836 --> 31:22.505
{\an8}- ALL I WANTED--I HEARD
THAT PAULY SAID THAT I WAS FAKE.

31:22.589 --> 31:23.881
{\an8}THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO KNOW.

31:23.965 --> 31:26.509
{\an8}- AND NOW I LOOK
LIKE A [bleep] DOUCHE BAG.

31:26.593 --> 31:29.721

31:29.804 --> 31:30.388
{\an8}- I REALLY DON'T CARE.
I JUST...

31:30.471 --> 31:34.934
{\an8}I WANT TO GO HOME.

ABOUT YOU, RIGHT?

31:58.124 --> 32:00.251
{\an8}- I--YEAH, I JUST--
- 100--100 TIMES I SWEAR

32:00.335 --> 32:03.755
{\an8}ON MY MOTHER'S LIFE,
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

32:03.838 --> 32:05.465
{\an8}- JENNI, DID I EVER SAY
THAT VINNY SAID ANYTHING

32:05.548 --> 32:06.507
{\an8}ABOUT YOU, OR PAULY?

32:06.591 --> 32:08.343
{\an8}DID I EVER?

32:08.426 --> 32:09.302
{\an8}- IT WAS A NOD.

32:09.385 --> 32:10.928
{\an8}- DID I EVER SAY
THAT THEY TALKED [bleep]

32:11.012 --> 32:12.305
{\an8}ABOUT YOU
BEHIND YOUR BACK?

32:12.388 --> 32:13.014
{\an8}- NEVER.
- I NEVER DID.

32:13.097 --> 32:14.015
{\an8}- NEVER.
- I NEVER DID.

32:14.098 --> 32:16.476
{\an8}- SHE EVEN SAID
THE SAME THING TO ME.

32:16.559 --> 32:17.518
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
SO NOW THAT THAT'S CLEARED UP...

32:17.602 --> 32:19.520
{\an8}- SHE EVEN SAID THE SAME THING,
THAT SHE...

32:19.604 --> 32:20.938
{\an8}- PAULY AND VINNY ARE
MY BEST FRIENDS IN THE HOUSE.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.732
{\an8}AND FOR THEM TO [bleep] YELL
AT ME LIKE THAT...

32:22.815 --> 32:24.776
{\an8}- NOBODY YELLED AT YOU.

32:24.859 --> 32:27.195
{\an8}- I DID NOTHING WRONG.

32:27.278 --> 32:28.696
{\an8}- SNOOKI'S CRYING.

32:28.780 --> 32:31.282
{\an8}I GOT JENNI THINKING
I WAS TALKING CRAP ABOUT HER.

32:31.366 --> 32:32.867
{\an8}IT HURTS,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

32:32.950 --> 32:33.993
{\an8}I'VE BEEN VERY CLOSE
WITH JENNI.

32:34.077 --> 32:36.454
{\an8}AND NOW JENNI HAS TO HEAR
FROM SNOOKI,

32:36.537 --> 32:37.372
{\an8}"DON'T TRUST ANYONE
IN THE HOUSE."

32:37.455 --> 32:39.082
{\an8}LIKE, YOU CAN TRUST ME,
YOU KNOW?

32:39.165 --> 32:40.124
{\an8}DON'T TELL PEOPLE
THAT YOU CAN'T TRUST ME.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.377
{\an8}- YOU HAVE FRIENDS
LEAVING THIS HOUSE.

32:42.460 --> 32:43.586
{\an8}I DON'T.

32:43.670 --> 32:44.545
{\an8}THANK YOU.

32:44.629 --> 32:46.172
{\an8}- NO. IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

32:46.255 --> 32:49.008
{\an8}- NO, IT DOES. IT DOES.
I'M NOT [bleep] STUPID.

32:49.092 --> 32:50.843
{\an8}- YOU TOLD ME
THAT THEY NODDED.

32:50.927 --> 32:53.304
{\an8}- BECAUSE MIKE WAS PISSED OFF
AT YOU.

32:53.388 --> 32:54.722
{\an8}- EXACTLY.

{\an8}- "EVERYBODY NODDED."
THERE SHE GOES AGAIN.

{\an8}I DON'T EVEN LIKE THE GIRL,

33:02.480 --> 33:04.232
{\an8}AND I DIDN'T EVEN NOD.

33:04.315 --> 33:07.068
{\an8}- IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH US.
IT WAS [bleep] BETWEEN THEM TWO.

{\an8}- I LOOK LIKE A [bleep]-TALKER,
AND I'M NOT.

33:09.779 --> 33:10.697
{\an8}I'M NOT.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.198
{\an8}- IT HAS TO DO
WITH THE CONVERSATION

33:12.281 --> 33:13.908
{\an8}I HAD WITH MIKE
IN HIS BEDROOM.

33:13.991 --> 33:16.160
{\an8}ALL I DID WAS APOLOGIZE
TO HIM

33:16.244 --> 33:17.412
{\an8}AND SAID THAT I AM UPSET.

37:22.782 --> 37:25.868
{\an8}BYE.
BYE.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.703
{\an8}I LOVE YOU.

37:27.787 --> 37:28.913
{\an8}I'M GONNA MISS YOU.

37:28.996 --> 37:31.165
{\an8}- I FEEL LIKE ME AND RON
ARE GOOD,

37:31.248 --> 37:31.832
{\an8}EVEN THOUGH I'M HURT
AND HE EMBARRASSED ME

37:31.916 --> 37:34.001
{\an8}AND I KNOW WHAT HE DID,

37:34.085 --> 37:36.837
{\an8}HE HELPED ME GET
THROUGH THIS TIME IN MIAMI.

37:36.921 --> 37:37.797
{\an8}- GET HOME SAFE.

37:37.880 --> 37:41.092
{\an8}- FOR ME TO SURVIVE

37:41.175 --> 37:43.135
{\an8}AND MOVE ON,
I HAD TO GO TO SOMEBODY

37:43.219 --> 37:44.804
{\an8}WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY FRIEND
PRIOR TO EVERYTHING,

37:44.887 --> 37:45.846
{\an8}AND THAT WAS RON.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.682
{\an8}BYE.

37:47.765 --> 37:51.727
{\an8}- I THINK I PRETTY MUCH LEFT
THE WAY I WANTED TO LEAVE.

37:51.811 --> 37:53.312
{\an8}YOU KNOW, I LEFT
FRIENDS WITH MIKE,

37:53.396 --> 37:55.856
{\an8}GOOD FRIENDS WITH PAULY,
BROTHERS WITH VIN,

37:55.940 --> 37:56.857
{\an8}AND I LEAVE WITH MY GIRLFRIEND,

37:56.941 --> 37:59.610
{\an8}WHICH I DIDN'T COME
IN HERE WITH.

38:01.278 --> 38:02.238
{\an8}- NUH-UH.

38:02.321 --> 38:04.115
{\an8}SHE SAY BYE TO SNOOKS?

38:07.284 --> 38:09.870
{\an8}- LIKE THE SPITEFUL BITCH
THAT SHE IS,

38:09.954 --> 38:11.330
{\an8}SAM DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE ME.

38:11.414 --> 38:12.415
{\an8}AND IT'S JUST PATHETIC
AT THIS POINT.

38:12.498 --> 38:15.001
{\an8}BUT WHAT RON WILL DO
TO HER IN THE FUTURE

38:15.084 --> 38:16.043
{\an8}WILL JUST GO TO SHOW

38:16.127 --> 38:18.504
{\an8}WHO WAS ACTUALLY THERE
FOR HER

38:18.587 --> 38:20.047
{\an8}AND WHO WASN'T.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.215
{\an8}[bird caws]

38:21.298 --> 38:22.675
{\an8}- THAT'S HUGE.

38:22.758 --> 38:24.510
{\an8}- WHY WOULD THAT JUST BE HERE
RIGHT NOW?

38:24.593 --> 38:25.928
{\an8}[laughter]
- THAT'S BAD LUCK.

38:26.012 --> 38:27.221
{\an8}- THAT'S BAD [bleep] LUCK.

38:27.304 --> 38:30.766
{\an8}- A CROW COMES,
AND IT STARTS QUACKING AT US.

38:30.850 --> 38:32.059
{\an8}OR NOT QUACKING.
WHAT'S A CROW DO?

38:32.143 --> 38:34.562
{\an8}- ON THE LAST DAY,
THERE'S A [bleep] BLACK CROW.

38:34.645 --> 38:38.024
{\an8}- USUALLY WHEN A CROW COMES
AND IT DOES THAT,

38:38.107 --> 38:39.233
{\an8}THAT MEANS YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.985
{\an8}IT'S WARNING YOU OF YOUR DEATH.

38:41.068 --> 38:43.446
{\an8}SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE THINKING,
"WHO'S GONNA DIE RIGHT NOW?"

38:43.529 --> 38:44.780
{\an8}NOT GONNA BE ME.

38:44.864 --> 38:46.866
{\an8}- EVEN THOUGH WE'RE SEPARATED,
WE'RE STILL MVP.

38:46.949 --> 38:48.284
{\an8}- M.
- V.

38:48.367 --> 38:49.910
{\an8}- P.
- SPECIAL, WHAT?

38:49.994 --> 38:51.746
{\an8}MVP DEFINITELY LAID ITS MARK

38:51.829 --> 38:54.415
{\an8}HERE ON MIAMI,
AND WHEREVER WE GO

38:54.498 --> 38:55.916
{\an8}AND IF WE'RE TOGETHER,
MVP WILL LIVE ON FOREVER.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.252
{\an8}GUYS, HAVE A SAFE TRIP BACK.

38:58.335 --> 39:00.713
{\an8}- YOU TOO.
- AND I'LL SEE YOU

39:00.796 --> 39:01.797
{\an8}ON THE OTHER SIDE.

39:01.881 --> 39:02.715
{\an8}- HAVE A SAFE FLIGHT, MAN.
- LOVE YOU.

39:02.798 --> 39:04.759
{\an8}- LOVE YOU.
- LOVE YOU, VINNY.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.475
{\an8}- GROUP HUG.

39:12.558 --> 39:13.809
{\an8}- WHAT UP?

39:13.893 --> 39:14.602
{\an8}- JENNI IS MY SISTER.

39:14.685 --> 39:16.812
{\an8}I LOVE HER--
MY BEST FRIEND.

39:16.896 --> 39:18.856
{\an8}AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
EVERYBODY HAS THEIR MOMENTS

39:18.939 --> 39:19.482
{\an8}WHEN THEY'RE LIKE,
"[Bleep] YOU."

39:19.565 --> 39:21.358
{\an8}BUT WE AIRED IT OUT,

39:21.442 --> 39:23.861
{\an8}AND NOW I FEEL
LIKE IT'S ALL GOOD.

39:23.944 --> 39:25.362
{\an8}- I GOT YOU SLIM JIMS
AND RED BULL.

39:25.446 --> 39:27.156
{\an8}- DID YOU REALLY?
- YEAH.

39:27.239 --> 39:29.033
{\an8}- I'M GONNA HAVE SEX
WITH YOU LATER.

39:29.116 --> 39:30.910
{\an8}- COMING TO MIAMI,
I WAS REALLY STRESSED,

39:30.993 --> 39:33.120
{\an8}BUT OVER THE MONTHS,

39:33.204 --> 39:34.955
{\an8}I DEVELOPED A HUGE BOND
WITH THIS FAMILY,

39:35.039 --> 39:36.624
{\an8}LIKE, SO IT HURTS.
IT SUCKS.

39:36.707 --> 39:39.085
{\an8}LIKE, I FEEL LIKE
IT CAN'T END.

39:39.168 --> 39:41.128
{\an8}- [whines]

39:41.212 --> 39:43.881
{\an8}- I'LL CATCH YOU--I'LL CATCH YOU
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

39:43.964 --> 39:45.299
{\an8}- I LOVE YOU.

39:45.382 --> 39:46.384
{\an8}LOVE YOU.
- THIS IS NOT MY FIRST RODEO.

39:46.467 --> 39:50.930
{\an8}SO I KIND OF KNEW
FROM LAST YEAR IN JERSEY

39:51.013 --> 39:52.098
{\an8}THAT IT REALLY DOESN'T HIT YOU

39:52.181 --> 39:55.559
{\an8}UNTIL YOU MAYBE HUG
THAT LAST PERSON GOOD-BYE

39:55.643 --> 39:56.894
{\an8}AND YOU WALK OUT THE DOOR.

39:56.977 --> 40:00.022
{\an8}WOW, LIKE, IT'S REALLY OVER.

40:00.106 --> 40:02.900
{\an8}- THERE WAS MAD DRAMA
THAT WENT DOWN,

40:02.983 --> 40:05.778
{\an8}BUT I'M GONNA MISS MIAMI
COMPLETELY.

40:05.861 --> 40:07.863
{\an8}- MIAMI!

40:07.947 --> 40:09.073
{\an8}- SEE YOU, MIAMI.
- MIAMI!

40:09.156 --> 40:10.324
{\an8}- I'M GONNA MISS YOU, MIAMI.

40:10.407 --> 40:12.076
{\an8}OH, MY GOD,
I'M GONNA MISS MIAMI.
