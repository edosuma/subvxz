WEBVTT

01:07.734 --> 01:09.652
LADY, STAY AWAY
FROM MY HANGAR.

01:09.736 --> 01:10.612
STAY AWAY FROM MY BIRDS.

01:10.695 --> 01:13.323
I DIDN'T TOUCH THEM
AND THEY'RE NOT YOURS.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.116
I ADOPTED THEM.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.284
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

01:16.367 --> 01:17.660
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:17.744 --> 01:20.622
THIS KOOK YOU'VE GOT
WORKING FOR YOU

01:20.705 --> 01:23.625
WAS BY MY HANGAR
IN THE TALL GRASS

01:23.708 --> 01:25.835
CRAWLING AROUND
ON HER BELLY.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.171
SHE LOOKED LIKE
SOME MUTANT GOPHER.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.507
{\an3}YOU'RE NO MAGAZINE COVER
YOURSELF.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.674
HEY, YOU...

01:31.758 --> 01:34.844
LET'S JUST GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.304
WHAT IS THAT?

01:36.387 --> 01:39.474
I INVENTED IT TO PEEK
AROUND CORNERS

01:39.557 --> 01:41.476
AND LOOK AT BIRDS WITH.

01:41.559 --> 01:43.561
{\an3}IT'S CALLED
"THE THING I USE

01:43.645 --> 01:45.522
"TO PEEK AROUND CORNERS

01:45.605 --> 01:47.357
AND LOOK AT
BIRDS WITH."

01:47.440 --> 01:50.777
TELL HER TO KEEP IT
AWAY FROM MY HANGAR.

01:50.860 --> 01:54.197
I'M WATCHING THREE
SHORT-EARED OWLS NEST.

01:54.280 --> 01:58.535
{\an1}ROY MIGHT BUILD AN ADDITION
TO HIS HANGAR ON TOP OF THEM.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.204
{\an1}I NEED THAT SPACE
FOR A HANGAR

02:01.287 --> 02:03.331
TO PARK MY NEW PLANE.

02:03.414 --> 02:05.041
PUT IT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

02:05.124 --> 02:06.584
I'VE GOT
A SUGGESTION.

02:06.668 --> 02:09.545
{\an1}YOU AND ME,
IN THE PARKING LOT

02:09.628 --> 02:11.172
ANYTIME YOU'RE READY, GRANNY.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.174
SHE'S BEEN ASKING FOR IT.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.009
{\an3}TAKE YOUR BEST SHOT,
LUMPY.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.010
{\an3}COME ON.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.720
JOE, CAN YOU COME

02:17.804 --> 02:19.639
TO THE AIRPORT
COMMITTEE MEETING

02:19.722 --> 02:21.599
AND HELP SAVE THE OWLS?

02:21.683 --> 02:23.810
THIS DOESN'T CONCERN YOU

02:23.893 --> 02:27.564
{\an1}AND BESIDES, YOU MIGHT WANT ME
TO RETURN THE FAVOR.

02:27.647 --> 02:28.565
ROY'S RIGHT.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.441
IF I ATTEND THAT MEETING

02:30.525 --> 02:33.403
I COULD JEOPARDIZE
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.030
WHAT TIME SHOULD I BE THERE?

02:36.114 --> 02:38.032
8:00.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.076
YOU'RE
A SWEETHEART, JOE.

02:40.159 --> 02:42.078
THANKS FOR
A WONDERFUL FLIGHT.

02:42.161 --> 02:43.288
MY PLEASURE.

02:43.371 --> 02:46.249
{\an1}HAVE YOU SIGNED UP
FOR BONUS TRAVEL MILES?

02:46.332 --> 02:48.626
YOU HAVE THAT PROGRAM?

02:48.710 --> 02:51.421
{\an1}I DON'T, BUT FOR YOU,
I'D START ONE.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.756
GIVE ME YOUR PHONE NUMBER.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.050
YOU'LL SIT IN FIRST CLASS

02:56.134 --> 02:58.261
DINE WITH ME,
SIT ON MY LAP.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.930
GET SERIOUS.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.809
{\an1}BRIAN, DON'T USE MY AIRLINE
AS A DATING SERVICE.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.729
{\an1}EXPLAIN AGAIN
WHY WE HAVE THIS AIRLINE.

03:07.812 --> 03:10.231
{\an3}DAD SAID TO HAVE YOU
NEUTERED

03:10.315 --> 03:11.774
ALONG WITH RANGER.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.611
{\an1}I'VE GOT A BIG
SURPRISE FOR YOU.

03:14.694 --> 03:17.113
{\an1}HELEN, SHAKE IT
ON OVER HERE.

03:17.196 --> 03:19.407
YOU KNOW,
WE'RE ALWAYS SAYING

03:19.490 --> 03:22.327
WE NEVER GET TOGETHER
LIKE WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.245
WELL, LISTEN TO THIS.

03:24.329 --> 03:28.124
{\an1}FRIDAY NIGHT, THREE SEATS,
CENTER COURT

03:28.207 --> 03:30.293
CELTICS-KNICKS GAME.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.669
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.755
HOW DID YOU
SCORE THOSE TICKETS?

03:33.838 --> 03:35.632
REMEMBER JERRY FROM LOGAN?

03:35.715 --> 03:37.467
WITH THE HOLE
IN HIS CHEEK?

03:37.550 --> 03:40.637
{\an1}YEAH. HE HAS ACCESS
TO LARRY BIRD'S PERSONAL...

03:40.720 --> 03:42.430
{\an1}LARRY BIRD'S
PERSONAL SEATS.

03:42.513 --> 03:44.265
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.977
{\an1}NO. HE HAS ACCESS
TO BIRD'S PERSONAL PLUMBER.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.479
HE GOT US SEATS?

03:49.562 --> 03:53.316
NO. WE GOT THE TICKETS
FROM A GIRL NAMED BABS.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.692
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

03:54.776 --> 03:55.735
I'M THERE.

03:55.818 --> 03:58.154
THIS WILL BE
LIKE OLD TIMES.

03:58.237 --> 04:00.198
{\an3}THE THREE MUSKETEERS
TOGETHER AGAIN.

04:01.908 --> 04:05.495
SO, WHAT DO WE OWE BABS
FOR THE TICKETS?

04:05.578 --> 04:08.873
{\an1}I CAN ANSWER THAT
IN THREE SIMPLE WORDS.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.583
BONUS TRAVEL MILES.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.298
CONGRATULATIONS.

04:17.382 --> 04:20.134
I HOPE YOU ENJOY
YOUR HONEYMOON.

04:20.218 --> 04:21.135
{\an3}HI, FAY.

04:21.219 --> 04:22.637
HOW WAS THE FLIGHT?

04:22.720 --> 04:25.181
FINE. THE PROBLEM
WAS MAKING THEM

04:25.264 --> 04:28.184
{\an3}RETURN THEIR SEATS
TO THE UPRIGHT POSITION.

04:28.267 --> 04:30.520
{\an1}I'M GLAD YOU'RE
IN A CHIPPER MOOD.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.981
I'M GOING TO THE GAME
TONIGHT.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.357
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.693
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

04:36.776 --> 04:39.737
{\an1}ROY FOUND OUT
ABOUT THE GAME TONIGHT

04:39.821 --> 04:41.990
{\an1}AND ARRANGED
AN EMERGENCY MEETING.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.784
NO. YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND
SOMEONE ELSE

04:44.867 --> 04:46.786
TO HANDLE THAT OWL THING.

04:46.869 --> 04:48.705
WHAT ABOUT
THE PRESIDENT

04:48.788 --> 04:51.082
OF THE NANTUCKET
NATURE SOCIETY?

04:51.165 --> 04:52.959
NO, I'M AFRAID NOT.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.586
REMEMBER THE BUMPER
STICKER ON HER CAR--

04:55.670 --> 04:57.588
"I BREAK FOR FIELD MICE"?

04:57.672 --> 04:59.757
SHE DID AND WAS REAR-ENDED

04:59.841 --> 05:01.426
{\an1}BY A BUS.

05:01.509 --> 05:04.095
I VISITED HER
IN THE HOSPITAL.

05:04.178 --> 05:05.555
SHE'S DOING FINE.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.557
SHE'S STILL A LITTLE SKITTISH

05:07.640 --> 05:11.269
IF YOU COME UP BEHIND HER
AND GO, "BEEP!"

05:11.352 --> 05:12.270
YOU'VE GOT TO COME

05:12.353 --> 05:13.730
TO THE MEETING.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.231
YOU'RE MY ONLY HOPE.

05:15.314 --> 05:18.276
NO, NO, FAY.

05:18.359 --> 05:19.694
NO, NO, PLEASE.

05:19.777 --> 05:22.697
{\an1}WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE KNICKS AND THE CELTICS.

05:22.780 --> 05:23.906
YOU PROMISED.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.283
SHE'S GOT YOU THERE.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.368
{\an1}UNLESS YOU HAD YOUR FINGERS
CROSSED

05:27.452 --> 05:28.745
YOU'RE DEAD MEAT.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.329
BUT...

05:30.413 --> 05:32.040
OH, ALL RIGHT.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.583
BE THERE AT 8:00.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.209
IT SHOULD BE FUN.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.627
FRANK GOODMAN'S TWINS

05:36.711 --> 05:38.087
HAVE THEIR
TONSILS OUT

05:38.171 --> 05:41.257
AND HE'S GOING TO BRING THEM--

05:41.340 --> 05:43.301
THE TWINS... I THINK.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.222
BAD NEWS, GUYS.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.266
{\an1}I CAN'T GO
TO THE GAME.

05:50.349 --> 05:52.977
I HAVE THIS AIRPORT
COMMITTEE MEETING.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.062
OH, NO, JOE.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.438
I'M AFRAID SO

05:55.521 --> 05:59.484
{\an1}BUT PROMISE ME YOU
WON'T LET MY NOT GOING

05:59.567 --> 06:01.194
STAND IN YOUR WAY.

06:03.988 --> 06:06.407
STAND IN OUR WAY OF WHAT?

06:06.491 --> 06:07.784
THE THREE MUSKETEERS.

06:07.867 --> 06:11.496
IT WOULD BE JUST LIKE YOU
TO CANCEL BECAUSE OF ME.

06:11.579 --> 06:13.790
GOOD ONE, JOE.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.416
OH, OH.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.293
WHAT TIME SHOULD WE LEAVE?

06:17.376 --> 06:18.628
{\an3}SOMEWHERE
AROUND 6:00.

06:22.006 --> 06:24.133
{\an3}Brian:
JOEY, WHAT'S UP?

06:24.217 --> 06:27.136
{\an1}I'M TRYING TO RECONCILE
THESE FUEL BILLS

06:27.220 --> 06:29.138
AGAINST THE ORIGINAL ORDERS.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.016
OH, WELL, DON'T
LET ME BOTHER YOU.

06:32.100 --> 06:36.813
(<i> imitating ping-pong noises</i> )

06:41.567 --> 06:45.488
(<i> imitating ping-pong</i>
<i>bouncing away</i> )

06:45.571 --> 06:47.115
DID YOU WANT SOMETHING?

06:47.198 --> 06:51.160
I CAME TO SAY IT WON'T BE
THE SAME WITHOUT YOU.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.204
YOU WON'T BE
NEEDING THIS.

06:53.287 --> 06:55.248
I'M KIND OF BUSY HERE.

06:55.331 --> 06:56.833
I'VE GOT TO FINISH...

06:56.916 --> 06:58.668
HEY, I'M BOTHERING YOU.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.294
SORRY, SORRY,
SORRY, SORRY.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.504
SORRY.

07:01.587 --> 07:05.383
(<i> tapping pencil</i> )

07:11.889 --> 07:14.809
{\an1}YOU KNOW THERE IS ONE THING,
THOUGH.

07:14.892 --> 07:17.562
{\an1}I'VE ASKED YOU THIS BEFORE,
MAYBE

07:17.645 --> 07:20.231
BUT JUST IN CASE
ANYTHING'S CHANGED...

07:20.314 --> 07:22.233
WHAT, WHAT?

07:22.316 --> 07:23.985
YOU AND HELEN?

07:24.068 --> 07:28.197
{\an1}IS THERE ANYTHING GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU GUYS?

07:28.281 --> 07:31.659
{\an1}HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
HER CELLO OUT OF ITS CASE?

07:31.742 --> 07:33.035
NO, I TOLD YOU.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.162
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.330
GOOD. SEE YOU.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.416
WHY DO YOU ASK?

07:38.499 --> 07:40.459
OH, IT'S NOTHING IMPORTANT.

07:40.543 --> 07:44.046
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
I THOUGHT I PICKED UP ON.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.381
PICKED UP ON?

07:45.464 --> 07:48.509
{\an1}WHY? DID HELEN SAY SOMETHING
ABOUT ME?

07:48.593 --> 07:51.512
NO. I'M TRYING TO BE CAREFUL--

07:51.596 --> 07:54.515
GIVEN OUR HISTORY,
THE WOMEN AND ALL.

07:54.599 --> 07:58.227
{\an1}LIKE WHEN YOU RAN OFF
WITH CAROL, MY GIRLFRIEND?

07:58.311 --> 07:59.437
GOOD EXAMPLE.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.731
{\an3}THIS TIME I WANT
NOBODY'S TOES

08:01.814 --> 08:03.608
TO BE STEPPED ON.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.902
{\an1}WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"THIS TIME"?

08:05.985 --> 08:11.240
{\an1}JOE, WHEN A MAN AND A WOMAN
ARE ALONE TOGETHER

08:11.324 --> 08:13.075
THINGS CAN HAPPEN

08:13.159 --> 08:15.077
AND SO, IF BY CHANCE

08:15.161 --> 08:18.748
IF BY THE GRACE OF GOD,
THINGS HAPPEN WITH HELEN

08:18.831 --> 08:21.083
I'LL FEEL BETTER
HAVING YOUR BLESSINGS.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.084
THANK YOU.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.086
I DIDN'T GIVE
MY BLESSINGS.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.088
I SIMPLY ANSWERED A QUESTION.

08:26.172 --> 08:29.592
BESIDES, YOU'RE FORGETTING
HELEN DOESN'T DATE PILOTS.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.094
YES, BUT IF OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS

08:32.178 --> 08:35.932
I WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH TO WEAR
WHEN I ANSWER THE DOOR.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.933
YOU'RE DREAMING.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.769
HEY, DAMN RIGHT.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.270
WELL, SEE YOU LATER.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.940
WISH US LUCK.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.775
RIGHT. GO, CELTS.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.193
HUH?

08:47.276 --> 08:48.653
OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

08:48.736 --> 08:49.987
CELTS.

08:58.579 --> 09:03.334
{\an5}Roy:
<i>THE AIRPORT IS</i>
<i>OUR MAJOR ARTERY.</i>

09:03.417 --> 09:04.961
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
SOME COCK-EYED OWL.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.379
SHORT-EARED OWL.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.882
{\an1}HEAR WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE CELTICS?

09:09.966 --> 09:12.635
{\an1}A WATER PIPE BROKE
AND FLOODED THE COURT.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.428
THEY CALLED OFF THE GAME.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.472
THEN I DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING.

09:16.555 --> 09:17.890
THAT'S GREAT.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.100
NO, IT ISN'T.

09:19.183 --> 09:20.685
IF THERE WASN'T A GAME

09:20.768 --> 09:24.230
WHAT ARE BRIAN AND HELEN DOING,
AND WHERE ARE THEY DOING IT?

09:25.690 --> 09:27.650
JOE, YOU'RE NEXT UP.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.946
WELL, THOSE OWLS SEEM FINE

09:32.029 --> 09:35.324
{\an1}SO I THINK WE SHOULD LEAVE
WELL ENOUGH ALONE.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.784
YOU CALL THAT PROGRESS?

09:36.867 --> 09:39.954
ROY, THOSE THREE OWLS
SHOULD BE TOGETHER.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.790
{\an1}NOBODY SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT SEPARATING THEM.

09:42.873 --> 09:44.125
NOBODY EVER DOES.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.626
IT JUST HAPPENS.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.796
THE BALANCE OF NATURE
IS VERY DELICATE.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.631
THE SLIGHTEST
DISTURBANCE

09:50.715 --> 09:52.800
AND EVERYTHING CAN GO
OFF-KILTER.

09:52.883 --> 09:56.512
HERE WE HAVE THREE OWLS
WHO ARE PERFECTLY HAPPY.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.139
BUT, WHAT IF ONE DAY

09:58.222 --> 10:01.684
TWO OF THOSE OWLS
DECIDED TO FLY AWAY

10:01.767 --> 10:03.519
TO BOSTON, FOR EXAMPLE?

10:03.602 --> 10:05.563
LEAVING THE THIRD OWL

10:05.646 --> 10:07.606
TO DO HIS CIVIC DUTY.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.568
IT MIGHT START
WITH JUST BASKETBALL.

10:10.651 --> 10:13.529
BUT WHAT IF THAT GAME
WERE CANCELLED?

10:15.281 --> 10:16.866
WHAT WOULD THEY DO THEN?

10:16.949 --> 10:18.367
THINK ABOUT IT.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.828
TWO HEALTHY, ATTRACTIVE OWLS.

10:20.911 --> 10:23.914
{\an1}BEFORE LONG, THEY WOULDN'T LET
THEIR FRIEND

10:23.998 --> 10:25.416
INTO THE NEST.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.209
THE FRIEND THAT
WAS ALWAYS THERE.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.211
DOES THAT SOUND FAIR?

10:29.295 --> 10:31.172
THE GOOD OWL

10:31.255 --> 10:34.091
THE RESPONSIBLE OWL
WOULD BE OUT IN THE COLD

10:34.175 --> 10:36.510
WHILE THE OTHER TWO
WERE HAVING FUN.

10:39.513 --> 10:40.723
JOE...

10:40.806 --> 10:42.516
HUH?

10:42.600 --> 10:43.726
OH.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.311
SAVE THE OWLS.

10:48.731 --> 10:49.899
THANK YOU, JOE.

10:49.982 --> 10:52.276
AND BEFORE WE LEAVE TONIGHT

10:52.360 --> 10:55.696
{\an1}LET'S MAKE SURE
JOE HAS A DESIGNATED DRIVER.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.239
WELL, TIME TO VOTE.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.866
{\an1}Lowell:
EXCUSE ME...

10:58.949 --> 11:00.785
I HEARD JOE MENTION OWLS

11:00.868 --> 11:03.913
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF THIS HAS ANY RELEVANCE

11:03.996 --> 11:07.792
BUT I WAS OUT BY ROY'S HANGAR
AND I RAN OVER THREE OF THEM.

11:09.668 --> 11:11.462
MEETING'S ADJOURNED.

11:11.545 --> 11:14.757
REFRESHMENTS OVER
AT THE COUNTER.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.550
GEE, FAY,
I'M REALLY SORRY.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.260
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION

11:18.344 --> 11:20.513
I DON'T THINK
THE OWLS SUFFERED.

11:20.596 --> 11:23.432
{\an3}YOU CRUSHED THEM
WITH A TRUCK?

11:23.516 --> 11:24.517
BUT REAL QUICK.

11:26.352 --> 11:29.313
I HAD TO BE DOING
A GOOD 40.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.565
CHICKEN WING, FAY?

11:35.528 --> 11:37.613
Helen:
THAT WAS SPECIAL.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.823
I HAD NO IDEA

11:38.906 --> 11:40.282
YOU COULD DO
A FLAMING SWORD DANCE.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.576
NO ONE WAS MORE SURPRISED
THAN ME

11:42.660 --> 11:45.871
EXCEPT MAYBE THE TOURISTS
AT THE OLD NORTH CHURCH.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.206
I REALLY HAD A GOOD TIME.

11:47.289 --> 11:48.290
ME, TOO. ME, TOO.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.292
{\an1}COME IN
FOR SOME COFFEE.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.919
REALLY?

11:52.002 --> 11:54.296
ME IN THE INNER SANCTUM?

11:54.380 --> 11:56.966
WELL, SO LONG
AS I'M ALREADY HERE.

11:57.049 --> 11:59.301
Helen:
HOPE INSTANT'S OKAY.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.303
YEAH, BUT MAKE IT QUICK.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.516
NICE SHOT OF YOUR PARENTS.

12:05.599 --> 12:09.520
I ALWAYS GOT THE FEELING
YOUR OLD MAN WASN'T FOND OF ME.

12:09.603 --> 12:10.980
NO, THAT WAS MOM.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.274
DAD COULDN'T STAND YOU.

12:13.357 --> 12:14.650
BE OUT IN A MINUTE.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.444
MAKE YOURSELF
COMFORTABLE.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.779
COMFORTABLE.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.656
I CAN DO COMFORTABLE.

12:20.739 --> 12:24.994
{\an1}<i>TOO BAD JOE COULDN'T</i>
<i>MAKE IT TONIGHT.</i>

12:25.077 --> 12:28.080
YEAH, IT'S A REAL SHAME.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.502
<i>ON THE OTHER HAND</i>

12:33.586 --> 12:35.921
{\an1}<i>IT DID GIVE YOU AND ME</i>
<i>A CHANCE</i>

12:36.005 --> 12:37.882
<i>TO BECOME REACQUAINTED.</i>

12:37.965 --> 12:42.511
YEAH, I HAVEN'T FELT
THIS CLOSE TO YOU IN YEARS.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.556
{\an1}<i>I FEEL</i>
<i>THE EXACT SAME WAY.</i>

12:45.639 --> 12:47.725
{\an1}<i>WHEN I MOVED HERE</i>
<i>FROM TEXAS</i>

12:47.808 --> 12:50.227
<i>I DON'T KNOW WHAT</i>
<i>I WOULD HAVE DONE</i>

12:50.311 --> 12:51.979
<i>WITHOUT YOU AND JOE.</i>

12:52.062 --> 12:55.483
{\an1}<i>EVERYONE ELSE WAS AFRAID</i>
<i>TO EVEN TALK TO ME.</i>

12:55.566 --> 12:56.692
<i>YOU KNOW WHAT?</i>

12:56.775 --> 12:58.861
{\an1}<i>I'M KIND OF ASHAMED</i>
<i>TO ADMIT THIS</i>

12:58.944 --> 13:01.197
{\an1}<i>BUT ALL NIGHT,</i>
<i>I KEPT EXPECTING YOU</i>

13:01.280 --> 13:04.074
{\an1}<i>TO MAKE SOME ASININE</i>
<i>SCHOOLBOY PASS AT ME.</i>

13:04.158 --> 13:07.286
{\an1}<i>BOY, WOULDN'T THAT HAVE</i>
<i>RUINED THE WHOLE EVENING?</i>

13:07.369 --> 13:08.245
IT WOULD?

13:08.329 --> 13:10.998
<i>IT SURE WOULD.</i>

13:11.081 --> 13:13.209
{\an1}<i>IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN</i>
<i>A NICE TIME</i>

13:13.292 --> 13:14.877
<i>AND TURNED IT CHEAP.</i>

13:14.960 --> 13:19.006
{\an1}<i>THESE DAYS, ALL GUYS</i>
<i>SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN</i>

13:19.089 --> 13:20.257
<i>IS SCORING.</i>

13:20.341 --> 13:22.384
<i>BOY, IS THAT</i>
<i>A TURN-OFF.</i>

13:22.468 --> 13:26.597
COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE.

13:26.680 --> 13:30.518
{\an1}<i>IF THEY ONLY KNEW</i>
<i>HOW STUPID THEY LOOKED.</i>

13:30.601 --> 13:32.520
YEAH... YEAH, STUPID.

13:32.603 --> 13:35.064
<i>DO YOU TAKE CREAM?</i>

13:35.147 --> 13:36.524
OH, OKAY.

13:39.318 --> 13:42.071
THIS IS REALLY AMUSING.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.031
{\an1}<i>GREAT MOMENTS</i>
<i>IN BRITISH HISTORY?</i>

13:44.114 --> 13:48.077
YEAH, CHURCHILL JUST GAVE
THE QUEEN A WEDGIE.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.913
BRIAN, CAN I ASK YOU
A PERSONAL QUESTION?

13:50.996 --> 13:52.665
YEAH. I WISH YOU WOULD.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.920
{\an1}WHY DID YOU
EVER MARRY CAROL?

13:58.003 --> 14:02.132
I MEAN, HERE YOU WERE,
A REASONABLY NICE GUY

14:02.216 --> 14:07.221
{\an1}TAKEN IN BY A MANIPULATIVE,
OVERSEXED, HOT-PANTSIED LIAR.

14:07.304 --> 14:10.266
WHAT COULD
IT HAVE BEEN?

14:10.349 --> 14:12.309
COME ON, BRIAN, BE SERIOUS.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.727
OKAY.

14:16.063 --> 14:18.941
I MARRIED CAROL BECAUSE...

14:19.024 --> 14:24.947
{\an1}UH, WHEN IT CAME TO HER,
I COULDN'T SAY NO TO ANYTHING.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.575
{\an3}I GAVE HER
WHATEVER SHE WANTED.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.703
FOR A SHORT TIME,
I GUESS SHE WANTED ME.

14:30.786 --> 14:31.704
SO...

14:41.005 --> 14:43.299
I WAS HURT, HELEN.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.679
HURT BADLY.

14:48.762 --> 14:52.016
AND I'M NOT ASHAMED
TO ADMIT

14:52.099 --> 14:55.519
{\an3}THAT IN THE SOLITUDE
OF MY ROOM

14:55.603 --> 14:57.146
I HAVE WEPT.

14:57.229 --> 15:00.107
{\an3}I SOMETIMES WONDER
IF I'LL EVER BE ABLE

15:00.190 --> 15:01.650
TO TOUCH A WOMAN AGAIN.

15:05.362 --> 15:07.489
DO I LOOK THAT STUPID
TO YOU?

15:07.573 --> 15:11.285
{\an1}OF COURSE NOT,
BUT LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING.

15:11.368 --> 15:14.330
I HOPED WE'D GET
THROUGH THIS EVENING

15:14.413 --> 15:16.498
WITHOUT YOU BEING A JERK.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.126
I LASTED LONGER
THAN YOU THOUGHT I WOULD.

15:19.209 --> 15:21.545
COME ON,
IT'S TIME TO GO HOME.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.885
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

15:27.968 --> 15:30.304
JOE IS PARKED
ACROSS THE STREET

15:30.387 --> 15:32.306
WATCHING THE HOUSE.

15:32.389 --> 15:33.891
JOE?

15:33.974 --> 15:35.684
WHAT'S HE DOING OUT THERE?

15:38.103 --> 15:41.690
HE DOESN'T TRUST US
TO BE ALONE TOGETHER.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.485
IS IT ANY OF HIS BUSINESS?

15:44.568 --> 15:48.447
{\an1}HE TREATS ME LIKE
I'M HIS LITTLE SISTER.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.949
WELL, IF JOE WANTS TO WORRY

15:51.033 --> 15:54.953
I'M GOING TO GIVE HIM SOMETHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.956
{\an1}I THINK IT'S TIME
YOU AND I TEACH JOE A LESSON.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.667
GOOD IDEA, HELEN.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.338
LET'S YOU AND I TEACH HIM

16:04.421 --> 16:07.675
UNTIL WE'RE TOO EXHAUSTED
TO TEACH HIM ANYMORE.

16:09.968 --> 16:12.346
{\an1}WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE YOU GO OUT THE BACK

16:12.429 --> 16:14.390
AND WE'LL LEAVE JOE THINKING

16:14.473 --> 16:16.558
{\an3}YOU AND I SPENT THE NIGHT
TOGETHER.

16:16.642 --> 16:20.062
{\an1}YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
REALLY TEACH HIM?

16:20.145 --> 16:24.733
{\an1}IF WE TOOK OFF ALL OUR CLOTHES
AND PRANCED BY THE WINDOW.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.069
{\an3}GET OUT.

16:31.448 --> 16:32.950
HEY, HELEN...

16:33.033 --> 16:36.412
JOE DIDN'T COME BACK HOME
LAST NIGHT.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.747
HE WAS STILL ASLEEP
IN HIS CAR

16:38.831 --> 16:40.582
WHEN I LEFT FOR WORK.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.418
{\an1}WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO TELL HIM?

16:42.501 --> 16:44.795
WHEN WE'VE HAD
A LITTLE FUN WITH HIM.

16:44.878 --> 16:46.588
WE DESERVE THE PLEASURE

16:46.672 --> 16:48.757
OF WATCHING HIM
TWIST IN THE WIND.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.468
{\an1}I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD SUCH A DARK SIDE.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.512
I LIKE IT.

16:56.682 --> 16:57.599
MORNING, JOE.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.309
MORNING, SUNSHINE.

16:59.393 --> 17:00.978
BRIAN.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.104
HELEN.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.605
YOU KNOW, BRIAN

17:03.689 --> 17:06.608
I CAN'T QUIT THINKING
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.609
I HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.237
{\an3}ME, TOO.

17:10.319 --> 17:11.946
YOUR UH...

17:12.030 --> 17:14.825
{\an3}COFFEE WAS NOTHING SHORT
OF INCREDIBLE.

17:14.907 --> 17:15.951
{\an1}THANK YOU.

17:16.034 --> 17:18.746
{\an1}I THOUGHT IT WAS
INCREDIBLE MYSELF.

17:18.829 --> 17:23.625
{\an3}WHAT KNOCKS ME OUT
IS HOW IT STAYED SO HOT.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.712
{\an3}WE'LL HAVE
TO HAVE... COFFEE AGAIN.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.716
SOON, I HOPE.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.431
SO, HOW WAS THE GAME?

17:37.514 --> 17:38.515
Both:
OH, GREAT.

17:38.599 --> 17:41.310
IT WAS AN USUALLY
PHYSICAL EVENING.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.645
{\an3}LOTS OF CONTACT,
LOTS OF SWEAT

17:43.729 --> 17:46.315
LOTS OF SCORING.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.150
WE REALLY MISSED YOU, JOE.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.151
YOU DID NOT.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.986
YOU DIDN'T MISS ME

17:51.069 --> 17:54.490
AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW
THE CELTICS GAME WAS CALLED OFF.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.783
I KNOW THAT.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.660
I'M TALKING LATER ON,
AT HELEN'S.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.997
WE PLAYED TWISTER.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.624
ALL NIGHT?

18:03.707 --> 18:06.043
{\an1}I KNOW YOU NEVER CAME HOME
LAST NIGHT.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.003
ARE YOU SURE, JOE?

18:08.086 --> 18:09.546
ARE YOU POSITIVE?

18:09.630 --> 18:11.465
WOULD YOU STAKE
YOUR LIFE?

18:11.548 --> 18:13.842
THIS COULD BE
A TRICK QUESTION.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.260
I'D STAKE MY LIFE.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.513
BANG, BANG, YOU'RE DEAD.

18:17.596 --> 18:20.641
JOE, WE SAW YOU OUTSIDE.

18:20.724 --> 18:23.060
WHILE YOU WERE STARING
AT MY FRONT DOOR

18:23.143 --> 18:24.561
BRIAN LEFT OUT THE BACK.

18:24.645 --> 18:27.397
WE WERE BOTH HOME
IN OUR OWN BEDS ALONE.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.691
Helen:
THE NEXT TIME

18:29.775 --> 18:33.153
{\an1}YOU WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT MY PRIVATE LIFE, ASK ME.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.864
IT'LL SAVE YOU A NIGHT
ON STAKEOUT.

18:35.948 --> 18:40.035
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SPY ON ME?

18:40.118 --> 18:41.578
I WASN'T SPYING.

18:41.662 --> 18:44.122
I WAS JUST WATCHING
WITHOUT YOU KNOWING IT.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.376
THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.419
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.759
BRIAN AND I ALWAYS HAD
THIS WEIRD COMPETITION.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.886
I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE RULES.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.096
BUT WHEN HE WINS

18:59.179 --> 19:01.890
{\an1}THE PRIZE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING
OF MINE.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.559
FIRST, IT WAS A BASEBALL.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.227
THEN IT WAS A BICYCLE.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.646
THEN, A FEW YEARS AGO,
IT WAS CAROL.

19:08.981 --> 19:12.943
{\an1}WELL, LAST NIGHT, I FELT
HE WAS TAKING AWAY A FRIEND.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.864
YOU KNOW HOW BRIAN IS.

19:16.947 --> 19:20.826
HE DIDN'T GIVE YOU
ANY BONUS TRAVEL MILES, DID HE?

19:20.909 --> 19:21.743
WHAT?

19:21.827 --> 19:23.245
NEVER MIND.

19:23.328 --> 19:26.415
{\an1}IT'S JUST THAT I'D GOTTEN USED
TO LOOKING AFTER YOU

19:26.498 --> 19:27.708
LIKE A BIG BROTHER.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.960
IF YOU WANT ME TO STOP,
I WILL.

19:30.043 --> 19:31.044
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.588
THIS IS CONFUSING.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.215
WHEN A BROTHER THINKS
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE

19:35.299 --> 19:37.551
HE PUNCHES YOUR DATE
IN THE NOSE.

19:37.634 --> 19:41.138
{\an1}BUT ONLY SOMEONE WHO'S JEALOUS
SPIES ON YOU LIKE A JERK.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.766
WAIT A MINUTE.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.435
IS THAT IT?

19:46.518 --> 19:49.229
ARE YOU JEALOUS?

19:49.313 --> 19:50.939
JEALOUS? DON'T BE SILLY.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.149
YOU ARE.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.442
I'M NOT JEALOUS.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.777
{\an1}I'M JUST WORRIED,
THAT'S ALL.

19:55.861 --> 19:56.778
REALLY?

19:56.862 --> 19:57.779
THAT'S ALL?

19:57.863 --> 19:58.780
YEAH.

20:00.407 --> 20:02.784
DID YOU WANT ME
TO BE JEALOUS?

20:02.868 --> 20:04.453
NOW YOU'RE BEING SILLY.

20:04.536 --> 20:05.579
OF COURSE NOT.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.414
OH.

20:07.497 --> 20:11.960
NOW YOU SOUND DISAPPOINTED
THAT I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.462
WELL, I'M NOT.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.923
{\an1}SO, IF NEITHER OF US
IS DISAPPOINTED

20:16.006 --> 20:17.257
WE MUST BE FINE.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.592
WELL, I'M FINE. YOU?

20:18.675 --> 20:19.968
ME, TOO.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.512
FRIENDS?

20:22.596 --> 20:24.556
FRIENDS.

20:27.017 --> 20:30.771
{\an1}YOU KNOW, HELEN, SOMETIMES
IT'S OKAY FOR FRIENDS

20:30.854 --> 20:32.814
TO GIVE EACH OTHER A HUG.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.691
SURE, JOE.

20:42.866 --> 20:44.201
BRIAN...

20:44.284 --> 20:48.497
{\an1}YOU'RE HUGGING ME
AND CALLING OUT HIS NAME.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.290
NO, WE HAVE COMPANY.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.709
BRIAN HACKETT!

20:52.793 --> 20:58.131
{\an1}OH! PAY NO ATTENTION
TO THE GUY BEHIND THE BLINDS.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.677
I'M THE GREAT AND POWERFUL OZ.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.136
GET IN HERE!

21:03.220 --> 21:04.972
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:07.432 --> 21:08.850
{\an1}MAKING SURE HELEN
IS OKAY.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.019
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.689
{\an1}I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE
BORING HER TO DEATH.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.525
HEY, GUYS,
WOULD YOU CUT IT OUT.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.361
IF WE'RE GOING TO BE
THE THREE MUSKETEERS

21:19.444 --> 21:21.989
WE HAVE TO GET
A FEW THINGS STRAIGHT.

21:22.072 --> 21:22.990
GOOD IDEA...

21:23.073 --> 21:24.324
{\an3}SHUT UP!

21:24.408 --> 21:27.202
{\an1}FOR SOME REASON
THAT ESCAPES ME AT THIS MOMENT

21:27.285 --> 21:29.329
YOU TWO ARE MY CLOSEST FRIENDS.

21:29.413 --> 21:30.539
THAT'S <i> FRIENDS,</i> OKAY?

21:30.622 --> 21:32.541
COULD WE BE MORE THAN THAT?

21:32.624 --> 21:36.044
{\an1}WE'LL NEVER KNOW BECAUSE,
AS I'M SURE YOU BOTH REMEMBER

21:36.128 --> 21:37.254
I DON'T DATE PILOTS.

21:37.337 --> 21:38.255
ABOUT THAT...

21:38.338 --> 21:40.007
{\an3}SHUT UP!

21:40.090 --> 21:43.552
THE WHOLE IDEA WAS FOR US
TO START HAVING FUN AGAIN.

21:43.635 --> 21:46.722
{\an1}FOR THAT TO HAPPEN,
WE HAVE TO TRUST EACH OTHER

21:46.805 --> 21:49.558
{\an1}AND PROMISE IF TWO MUSKETEERS
ARE ALONE

21:49.641 --> 21:52.519
{\an1}THE REMAINING ONE
WON'T MAKE AN ASS OF HIMSELF.

21:52.602 --> 21:54.104
AGREED?

21:57.024 --> 21:58.650
AGREED.
AGREED.

22:00.986 --> 22:04.072
NOW, TUCK IN YOUR SHIRTS,
WIPE OFF YOUR NOSES

22:04.156 --> 22:05.741
AND GET BACK TO WORK.

22:12.622 --> 22:15.834
{\an1}MMM, YOU EVER NOTICE
THAT ONE OF THE MUSKETEERS

22:15.917 --> 22:18.378
{\an1}HAS A REALLY WORLD-CLASS SET
OF LEGS?

22:18.462 --> 22:19.755
GOD, YES.
