WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:02.268
This is the Ev

00:02.268 --> 00:04.037
Evergreen forest.

00:04.037 --> 00:06.239
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:08.141 --> 00:10.510
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.045
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.546 --> 00:15.648
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.549 --> 00:17.650
Yikes!

00:18.451 --> 00:20.020
Yaaaah...

00:22.655 --> 00:23.957
Yeaaaah!

00:23.957 --> 00:26.993
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:34.334 --> 00:36.870
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:38.304 --> 00:39.706
Cyril Sneer!

00:43.343 --> 00:45.545
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:46.212 --> 00:48.081
the Raccoons!!

00:48.081 --> 00:50.417
â™ª (show theme music) â™ª

01:02.462 --> 01:04.564
The sun has
risen on another day

01:04.564 --> 01:06.266
in the Evergreen forest.

01:06.266 --> 01:09.102
And while some folks have to
struggle to get out of bed,

01:09.102 --> 01:12.072
Cyril Sneer has no such problem.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.573
He never went to bed.

01:13.573 --> 01:16.342
You say this product's
going to sell like hotcakes?

01:16.342 --> 01:17.377
But how do I know that?

01:18.078 --> 01:20.246
Ha! Because they are hot cakes!

01:20.246 --> 01:21.948
Send me 600 units!

01:21.948 --> 01:24.317
Pig 1: Here are those
papers you wanted, boss.

01:24.317 --> 01:26.586
Pig 2: Oh, and you've got
10 appointments waiting

01:26.586 --> 01:27.887
in the outer office.

01:27.887 --> 01:30.590
Six are urgent,
three are critical,

01:30.590 --> 01:32.725
and one is...
Your son!

01:32.725 --> 01:34.861
Look son, I'm kind
of busy right now, but...

01:34.861 --> 01:36.963
I know, Pop.
That's why I thought

01:36.963 --> 01:38.765
I'd come down and
give you a hand.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.066
I appreciate that, son,

01:40.066 --> 01:41.968
but I've got
things under control.

01:41.968 --> 01:45.438
But Pop, you've
been working awfully hard.

01:45.438 --> 01:47.607
That's right, son.
Business is booming,

01:47.607 --> 01:50.376
and I'm in the middle
of half a dozen deals.

01:50.376 --> 01:52.412
Big deals! Big risks!

01:52.412 --> 01:54.914
But big risks mean big profits.

01:54.914 --> 01:56.449
Thanks anyway, son!

01:56.816 --> 01:59.119
Sure, Pop.
See you later.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.887
Yeah!?

02:00.887 --> 02:03.089
No, I said, 'buy, not sell'!

02:04.424 --> 02:05.925
Oh-oh, ouuuh!

02:07.227 --> 02:08.394
Boss!!! Oh-oh-ooh!

02:08.394 --> 02:10.396
Master Cedric, hurry!

02:10.396 --> 02:12.398
Something's happened
to the boss!

02:12.398 --> 02:13.366
Pop?!

02:14.000 --> 02:15.869
Oh... no!!

02:15.869 --> 02:17.837
Somebody call the doctor!

02:22.509 --> 02:23.176
What I have to say today does

02:23.176 --> 02:25.245
What I have to say today
does not come easy,

02:25.245 --> 02:27.413
but running Sneer Enterprises

02:27.413 --> 02:29.282
has become too much work

02:29.282 --> 02:31.784
and too much stress,
even for me.

02:32.652 --> 02:35.155
So, on the advice of my doctor,

02:35.155 --> 02:37.824
and for the sake of my health,

02:37.824 --> 02:39.325
I've decided to...

02:39.826 --> 02:40.827
...retire.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.929
Ralph/Pigs: Retire?!

02:42.929 --> 02:44.664
That's right,
I'm retiring.

02:44.664 --> 02:46.699
Hanging up the old calculator.

02:46.699 --> 02:48.701
I've made my last million,

02:48.701 --> 02:50.637
done my last deal.

02:50.637 --> 02:52.005
So what does this mean?

02:52.005 --> 02:54.807
No more Sneer Industries
in the Evergreen forest?

02:54.807 --> 02:56.509
Not a chance, Raccoon!

02:56.509 --> 02:59.212
I may be changing my lifestyle,

02:59.212 --> 03:01.514
but as long as there
is money to be made,

03:01.514 --> 03:03.850
Sneer Enterprises will be there,

03:03.850 --> 03:05.785
with a new president,

03:05.785 --> 03:08.488
my son, Cedric's Sneer.

03:12.225 --> 03:13.927
A million dollars?!

03:13.927 --> 03:17.764
Gee, that's a lot of prize
money to put up, Mr Steel!

03:17.764 --> 03:21.634
Oh, well now, it
takes money to make money.

03:21.634 --> 03:24.370
Triathlons are the
sporting event

03:24.370 --> 03:26.573
the public wants to see.

03:26.573 --> 03:29.909
You got runnin', you got
swimming, you got cycling.

03:29.909 --> 03:32.045
What more could you want?

03:32.045 --> 03:35.148
Well, I don't see how
we're going to make a profit.

03:35.148 --> 03:38.084
Eh, now
it's simple, Cedric.

03:38.084 --> 03:41.988
You put up the million
dollars in prize money,

03:41.988 --> 03:44.591
and I'll promote the race.

03:44.591 --> 03:47.026
Get us a lot of attention.

03:47.026 --> 03:50.563
Then we cut a deal
with the TV networks,

03:50.563 --> 03:52.699
and you make back your money

03:52.699 --> 03:55.301
plus a pretty little profit.

03:55.301 --> 03:56.703
Maybe.. but I...

03:56.703 --> 03:57.737
You want to think about it

03:57.737 --> 04:00.039
for a couple of years, do you?
Fine!!

04:00.039 --> 04:03.176
But I've got other
interested parties

04:03.176 --> 04:06.279
that will bang down
my door to sponsor

04:06.279 --> 04:10.416
the Evergreen International Triathlon.

04:10.883 --> 04:12.652
What would Pop do?

04:12.652 --> 04:14.721
Cyril's Voice:
Big deals, big risks!

04:14.721 --> 04:17.023
Big risks mean big profits!!

04:18.024 --> 04:20.293
Okay, count me in.

04:20.293 --> 04:21.294
Terrific.

04:22.595 --> 04:26.266
Now, I'll get this
triathlon on track

04:26.266 --> 04:30.136
and you get that
prize money in place.

04:30.136 --> 04:33.539
Sure. Now, I think we
should have big ads in all the...

04:33.539 --> 04:34.807
Sure thing, me butto...

04:34.807 --> 04:37.310
Um, look, I've got to fly.

04:38.978 --> 04:41.948
Gee, I sure hope
I did the right thing.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.016
What right thing?

04:43.016 --> 04:45.752
Pop! What are
you doing at the office?

04:45.752 --> 04:46.953
Nothing, son.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.489
Got some kind of deal on the go?

04:49.489 --> 04:51.224
Yes, but you're retired.

04:51.224 --> 04:54.527
You're not supposed to worry
about this stuff anymore.

04:54.527 --> 04:58.598
Just relax, Pop.
I can take care of things.

04:58.598 --> 05:01.834
You're right, son.
I'll get out of your hair.

05:01.834 --> 05:04.170
The worries are all yours now.

05:06.005 --> 05:08.207
Yeah.. and I just might

05:08.207 --> 05:09.909
have a million of them.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.946
I never thought
we'd be printing a story

05:13.946 --> 05:16.516
about Cyril Sneer's retirement.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.753
Oh, no!

05:20.753 --> 05:23.423
It looks like it's
break time, guys.

05:23.423 --> 05:26.359
I'll need a couple
of minutes to fix this.

05:26.359 --> 05:28.461
Sure, Ralph. And
while you're doing that job,

05:28.461 --> 05:31.297
I'll take care of
another job I started.

05:31.297 --> 05:32.832
Eating!! He-he!

05:32.832 --> 05:35.535
Hey, where is that sandwich?

05:35.535 --> 05:38.304
Gee,
it doesn't look good.

05:38.304 --> 05:41.507
Hey, I-I haven't heard
anybody talking about this.

05:41.507 --> 05:45.311
The Evergreen
International Triathlon.

05:45.311 --> 05:47.647
No wonder.
With an ad that small!

05:47.647 --> 05:50.049
Running,
cycling and swimming!

05:50.049 --> 05:52.051
Those are your
three best sports, Bert!

05:52.051 --> 05:53.386
Don't I know it!

05:53.386 --> 05:56.155
Prizes, cash...

05:56.155 --> 05:59.192
and a gold medal to be awarded.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.862
A gold medal? Wow!!

06:02.862 --> 06:04.897
Just like the Olympics!

06:04.897 --> 06:06.399
What's just
like the Olympics?

06:06.399 --> 06:08.167
The Evergreen Triathlon.

06:08.167 --> 06:11.237
Bert's gonna enter and he's
a cinch to win the gold medal!

06:11.237 --> 06:13.072
Ohh, he is, is he?

06:13.072 --> 06:15.808
Bert Raccoon
steps up to the podium

06:15.808 --> 06:17.877
to be presented
with the gold medal

06:17.877 --> 06:19.879
for his record-setting

06:19.879 --> 06:22.648
performance in the triathlon.

06:22.648 --> 06:24.650
The crowd goes nuts!

06:24.650 --> 06:26.919
You know, Bert, there are
others who could enter this race

06:26.919 --> 06:29.188
and they might be
just as good as you.

06:29.188 --> 06:32.425
Ha! Bring
on the competition!

06:32.425 --> 06:34.594
I'm in tip-top shape,

06:34.594 --> 06:36.429
plenty of exercise,

06:36.429 --> 06:38.464
a well balanced diet!

06:38.464 --> 06:40.466
Bert, would
peanut butter sandwiches

06:40.466 --> 06:42.835
be part of a well balanced diet?

06:42.835 --> 06:46.205
Um.. sure,
I guess so, Ralph.

06:46.205 --> 06:49.442
Good. Then after I
scrape this one out of here,

06:49.442 --> 06:53.312
you can eat it!
(giggles) Ehm!

06:57.517 --> 07:00.953
Ohh, what's going on
over at Lady Baden-Baden's?

07:00.953 --> 07:03.089
Looks like some
kind of big deal!

07:03.089 --> 07:05.892
Pig 1: Now, boss,
you're retired,

07:05.892 --> 07:09.762
and you told Master Cedric,
you wouldn't interfere.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.898
Interfere?!
Never!!

07:11.898 --> 07:14.066
I'm just following
the bouncing ball.

07:16.702 --> 07:18.137
Foooore!

07:21.574 --> 07:23.643
What the devil?

07:24.177 --> 07:25.778
Sorry about that, Knox!

07:25.778 --> 07:29.148
I guess I've got a
bigger slice than you! Hah!

07:29.148 --> 07:30.983
So what's going on here?

07:30.983 --> 07:33.119
Lady Baden-Baden: May I have
your attention, please?

07:33.119 --> 07:35.922
I would like to thank you
everyone for coming

07:35.922 --> 07:37.990
to our little
charity art auction.

07:37.990 --> 07:41.461
And especially like to
congratulate Cedric Sneer,

07:41.461 --> 07:44.497
for making the largest
bid of the day!

07:44.964 --> 07:47.266
$10,000!

07:47.266 --> 07:49.769
Ten.. thousand.. dollars?!

07:49.769 --> 07:52.004
That's quite some son

07:52.004 --> 07:54.941
you raised, Mr Sneer.

07:54.941 --> 07:58.511
You know, he's really
changing my impression

07:58.511 --> 08:02.014
of Sneer Enterprises!

08:02.014 --> 08:06.452
Yeah, and he's really
changing the bank balance, too.

08:06.452 --> 08:08.721
Okay Bert,
as your trainer,

08:08.721 --> 08:11.023
I think we should keep
track of your times,

08:11.023 --> 08:12.992
and then we can see
how you're improving.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.360
Sounds good, little buddy.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.330
Hey, how about down to
the big pine and back?

08:17.330 --> 08:19.398
Too easy!!
Bert/Bentley: Huh?!

08:19.398 --> 08:21.701
Lisa, w-w-what
are you doing?

08:21.701 --> 08:23.069
Same thing you are!

08:23.069 --> 08:26.305
Training to win the triathlon
and the gold medal.

08:26.305 --> 08:28.875
Ha, Bert's the best!
You can't beat him!

08:28.875 --> 08:29.942
No?!

08:29.942 --> 08:32.144
How about to Willow's
store and back?

08:32.144 --> 08:35.014
Sure. But listen,
if you get too tired,

08:35.014 --> 08:37.350
you could stop
and rest, you know.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.351
Go!!

08:41.888 --> 08:43.823
Cycling is my specialty!

08:43.823 --> 08:46.559
Now, the important
thing to remember is...

08:47.260 --> 08:48.528
...to pace yourself!

08:55.935 --> 08:57.737
Hi, guys.
How'd the training go?

08:57.737 --> 08:59.839
Lisa and
Bert had this race.

08:59.839 --> 09:01.541
It was great!!

09:01.541 --> 09:02.742
And what about Bert?

09:02.742 --> 09:05.378
Oh, uh,
he's not back yet.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.646
Oh...

09:06.646 --> 09:08.915
Phewwww...

09:08.915 --> 09:10.416
Oh! Oooh!

09:10.416 --> 09:12.018
Bert, are you alright?

09:12.018 --> 09:16.689
S-sure. I-I
just pulled something.

09:16.689 --> 09:18.457
It slowed me down, and I,

09:18.457 --> 09:20.626
I couldn't really race,

09:20.626 --> 09:22.728
full out, you know?
Wow!

09:22.728 --> 09:25.598
I just figured out
Lisa's time. Look!!

09:25.598 --> 09:27.767
Not bad!
We may just have

09:27.767 --> 09:29.569
a budding athlete in the family.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.871
If you get this kind
of time in the race tomorrow,

09:31.871 --> 09:33.773
you're a cinch to
win that gold medal!

09:33.773 --> 09:35.675
Hey, what about me?

09:35.675 --> 09:38.344
Uh, well...
anything can happen in a race,

09:38.344 --> 09:40.279
and you've got lots
of experience, but...

09:40.279 --> 09:43.282
Never mind. You guys
don't have to worry about me,

09:43.282 --> 09:45.685
because I'm not racing tomorrow!

09:45.685 --> 09:47.954
In fact, I quit!

09:53.192 --> 09:54.827
Pig 1: Rise and shine!

09:54.827 --> 09:56.929
Pig 2: Time to get up
and face another day

09:56.929 --> 10:00.766
of doing absolutely nothing!
Whoohooo!

10:00.766 --> 10:05.137
Pig 3: Gee, I can't wait
'til we get to retire.

10:05.137 --> 10:07.206
If you three don't
get out of this room,

10:07.206 --> 10:09.542
you won't live long
enough to retire!

10:09.542 --> 10:12.812
Pig 1: Now, now, we shouldn't
be getting all excited.

10:12.812 --> 10:16.716
Master Cedric wants you to know
he has an early meeting

10:16.716 --> 10:19.251
and won't be able to have
breakfast with you.

10:19.251 --> 10:20.820
A meeting?! With whom?

10:20.820 --> 10:24.190
Pig 1: Well, aren't we full
of questions this morning?

10:24.190 --> 10:27.460
But all you have to
worry about is drinking up,

10:27.460 --> 10:31.631
and then maybe we'll all go
out for a nice little walk.

10:39.171 --> 10:43.042
But, Mr Steel,
we still don't have a TV deal!

10:43.042 --> 10:45.411
Yeah, well,
I'm working on it, uh,

10:45.411 --> 10:47.413
these things take
time, you know.

10:47.413 --> 10:49.982
But the
triathlon is tomorrow!

10:49.982 --> 10:52.385
And without that deal,
I won't make back

10:52.385 --> 10:54.487
the prize money I'm putting up.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.322
I'm going to lose a fortune!

10:56.322 --> 10:58.457
Yeah, bucko, relax!

10:58.457 --> 11:00.559
Everything's under control.

11:00.559 --> 11:03.229
Hey.. look, I gotta fly.

11:05.197 --> 11:08.467
Okay, give me a call
when you get things worked out.

11:10.069 --> 11:12.004
Pop?! What are you doing here?

11:12.004 --> 11:13.939
Well, I was just uh,

11:13.939 --> 11:15.608
passing by and...

11:15.608 --> 11:17.643
You're supposed
to take it easy!

11:17.643 --> 11:20.913
No excitement, no
exertion, no stress.

11:20.913 --> 11:23.049
You've got to learn to relax.

11:23.049 --> 11:26.252
And I know just
who can teach you!

11:26.252 --> 11:27.953
Pigs!!
Pigs?!

11:29.889 --> 11:31.891
Pig 3: Now, relaxation can be

11:31.891 --> 11:34.360
a very tiring job.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.895
Pig 2: Ahhh!

11:35.895 --> 11:38.431
The trick is not to fight it.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.966
Pig 1: Yes, sleep on it.

11:50.843 --> 11:52.545
Pig 2: Stop, boss!!!
Pig 3: Enough!!

11:52.545 --> 11:54.613
Pig 1: No more.
Pig 3: Relax.

11:54.613 --> 11:55.648
Ha! Ha!

11:56.882 --> 11:59.385
Gee, Schaeffer,
being the new president

11:59.385 --> 12:02.621
of Sneer Enterprises
isn't all that easy.

12:02.621 --> 12:05.024
Can I have another
one of these, please?

12:05.024 --> 12:06.992
Why are you quitting?
Because!!

12:06.992 --> 12:08.260
What kind
of answer is that?

12:08.260 --> 12:10.096
Are you quitting because
you might lose to me?

12:10.096 --> 12:11.597
Ha! Of course not!

12:11.597 --> 12:14.066
I just don't feel
like racing right now!

12:14.066 --> 12:16.202
Bert Raccoon,
you're acting like a child!

12:16.202 --> 12:19.271
I don't want anything to do
with you or this stupid race!

12:19.271 --> 12:21.941
I wish I'd never heard of it!
I'm quitting too!

12:21.941 --> 12:25.778
I wish I'd never heard
of this stupid race either.

12:25.778 --> 12:26.879
Cedric?!

12:26.879 --> 12:28.781
You've entered
the triathlon?

12:28.781 --> 12:31.851
No, but I've
invested a lot of money in it,

12:31.851 --> 12:34.353
and, well, it's
not going so great.

12:35.955 --> 12:39.024
I think I've really
blown it this time, guys.

12:39.024 --> 12:42.828
If I sell these
fish at $8 a pound...

12:43.629 --> 12:47.767
Pool boys,
a fortune awaits us!

12:49.769 --> 12:53.472
Pig 1: Oh, he must
have got too much sun.

12:53.472 --> 12:55.441
Don't worry,
Cedric, old buddy!

12:55.441 --> 12:57.476
With Lisa and me
back in the race,

12:57.476 --> 13:00.112
we'll win that prize
money back for you!

13:00.112 --> 13:01.981
Thanks. I sure hope so.

13:01.981 --> 13:04.150
Hey, you
guys gotta see this!

13:04.150 --> 13:06.452
There's a guy training
for the triathlon,

13:06.452 --> 13:08.754
and is he good! Here he comes!

13:12.725 --> 13:14.960
Hey, that's Mr Steel!

13:14.960 --> 13:18.764
Fantastic! That was
your best time ever!

13:18.764 --> 13:21.801
Hey, what's
going on here, Mr Steel?

13:21.801 --> 13:24.303
Ah, Cedric Sneer.

13:24.303 --> 13:29.608
Here, I want you to
meet my son, Rod Steel.

13:29.608 --> 13:32.444
Rod's training for
tomorrow's race.

13:32.444 --> 13:35.447
Your son
can enter the race?!

13:35.447 --> 13:36.916
Why not?!

13:36.916 --> 13:39.919
Well, you're the
promoter. It wouldn't be right!

13:39.919 --> 13:42.922
Check the contract, bucko,

13:42.922 --> 13:44.657
there's nothing to stop us!

13:44.657 --> 13:47.827
Yeah, well, doesn't
that contract also say,

13:47.827 --> 13:50.763
you were supposed
to get TV coverage?!

13:50.763 --> 13:53.465
I've got it! Right here!

13:53.465 --> 13:55.301
That's it?!

13:55.301 --> 13:57.536
Mr Steel, Cedric
can't make his money back

13:57.536 --> 13:58.938
with that kind of coverage.

13:58.938 --> 14:01.607
You're just after
the prize money, aren't you?

14:01.607 --> 14:03.509
Bingo!!
You figured it out.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.945
But that won't do
ya' any good now,

14:05.945 --> 14:09.849
because Rod here has never
lost a race to anyone!

14:09.849 --> 14:13.485
Maybe, but then,
he's never raced against us!

14:13.485 --> 14:16.488
Ha! If this is a
competition popsy,

14:16.488 --> 14:19.225
that million bucks
is as good as ours!

14:19.225 --> 14:23.662
Yeah, got to fly, me buckos.

14:23.662 --> 14:25.764
So long, suckers!

14:30.870 --> 14:34.740
A million dollars?!
Why those crooks!!

14:35.708 --> 14:38.677
Boys, it's time to
come out of retirement!

14:42.615 --> 14:43.282
I wanna thank you for coming

14:43.282 --> 14:45.117
I wanna thank you for
coming down at the last minute

14:45.117 --> 14:46.752
to tape the race for me.

14:46.752 --> 14:48.420
Well, after what y'all did

14:48.420 --> 14:51.323
for Lady Baden-Baden's auction,

14:51.323 --> 14:54.526
I'm only too happy to help out

14:54.526 --> 14:57.563
a buddin' business tycoon.

14:57.563 --> 15:01.267
But, I doubt any TV network

15:01.267 --> 15:04.670
will be interested in
this sporting event.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.272
I understand there's only

15:06.272 --> 15:08.207
one real possible winner.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.277
I sure hope not!

15:11.277 --> 15:12.845
Everyone ready
for the big race?

15:12.845 --> 15:14.013
You bet!!

15:14.013 --> 15:15.714
Bert and I are gonna
give this guy Steel,

15:15.714 --> 15:17.349
a real run for the money!

15:17.349 --> 15:19.919
Well, you've got
your work cut out for you.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.354
I've done some checking
up on Rod Steel.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.056
Uh, how good is he?

15:24.056 --> 15:26.125
Never lost a race.

15:26.125 --> 15:30.429
It seems Robin Steel goes around
setting up these triathlons,

15:30.429 --> 15:32.398
which he barely advertises.

15:32.398 --> 15:34.867
Then his son blows
away the field,

15:34.867 --> 15:36.769
and they collect
the prize money.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.737
What a scam!!

15:38.737 --> 15:41.974
All participants,
please take your marks!

15:43.943 --> 15:45.210
I bought us
these binoculars

15:45.210 --> 15:46.578
to watch the race, Melissa.

15:47.179 --> 15:49.448
Gee, thanks, Ralph.

15:51.917 --> 15:54.987
Hey, it's Pop!
Pop, what are you doing?

15:54.987 --> 15:56.655
What about your condition?!

15:56.655 --> 15:59.458
Ohh, hi, son!

15:59.458 --> 16:02.528
Don't worry, I'm just going
to take it nice and easy.

16:03.495 --> 16:05.397
And take care of these crooks!

16:07.967 --> 16:09.568
That's nice and easy?!

16:09.568 --> 16:12.871
That's going to kill
him! I've gotta stop him!

16:12.871 --> 16:15.774
Pop, stop!! Don't do this!

16:15.774 --> 16:20.279
â™ª I don't wanna lose you, â™ª

16:20.279 --> 16:23.315
â™ª You can't slip away â™ª

16:24.416 --> 16:27.019
â™ª I don't wanna lose you, â™ª
Oh!

16:27.019 --> 16:29.254
â™ª Oh, won't you please stay? â™ª

16:29.254 --> 16:33.525
â™ª I just gotta tell you â™ª

16:33.525 --> 16:36.095
â™ª Before it gets too late â™ª

16:36.095 --> 16:39.365
â™ª I just gotta say it â™ª

16:39.365 --> 16:42.301
â™ª Before time seals our fate â™ª

16:42.301 --> 16:46.538
â™ª Hold back tomorrow â™ª

16:46.538 --> 16:49.341
â™ª Hold back the tide â™ª

16:49.341 --> 16:52.344
â™ª All that I ask for â™ª

16:52.344 --> 16:54.546
â™ª A little time â™ª

16:54.546 --> 16:58.450
â™ª Hold back tomorrow â™ª

16:58.450 --> 16:59.451
Uaaah!

16:59.451 --> 17:02.554
â™ª Hold back the morning light â™ª

17:02.554 --> 17:05.324
â™ª You're all I hoped for â™ª

17:05.324 --> 17:08.861
â™ª We just need time on our â™ª
Yikes!

17:08.861 --> 17:11.163
â™ª siiiiiide... â™ª

17:11.163 --> 17:12.531
Ugh!

17:18.470 --> 17:19.671
Yeaaaaa!

17:19.671 --> 17:21.540
Pop!
â™ª

17:21.540 --> 17:24.143
â™ª Hold back tomorrow â™ª

17:24.143 --> 17:27.880
â™ª Hold back the tide â™ª

17:27.880 --> 17:30.049
â™ª All that I ask for â™ª

17:30.049 --> 17:33.452
â™ª A little time â™ª

17:33.452 --> 17:36.555
â™ª Hold back tomorrow â™ª

17:36.555 --> 17:40.159
â™ª Hold back the morning light â™ª
Pop!

17:40.159 --> 17:43.028
â™ª You're all I hoped for â™ª

17:43.028 --> 17:48.367
â™ª We just need time
on our side â™ª

17:54.273 --> 17:56.608
Uhg! Oh!

17:59.211 --> 18:01.580
What are you d-doing, son?

18:01.580 --> 18:03.115
We have to catch up to them.

18:03.115 --> 18:04.950
It doesn't matter, Pop.

18:04.950 --> 18:08.987
This is one million
dollars we're talking about.

18:08.987 --> 18:11.924
No! It's you,
we're talking about.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.059
'cause if you don't slow down,

18:14.059 --> 18:16.462
well, all the money
in the world

18:16.462 --> 18:18.430
won't buy me another Pop.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.269
There they go, Ralph.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.572
And Lisa is right behind Rod!!

18:26.572 --> 18:27.806
Oh, great!

18:27.806 --> 18:29.808
They're way
ahead of everyone, Ralph!

18:30.642 --> 18:32.411
A girl!? Ha!

18:32.411 --> 18:34.179
Eat my dust!

18:44.523 --> 18:47.326
Hey, watch it!
Stay on your own side!

18:47.326 --> 18:49.094
Melissa, could
you give me a hand?

18:49.094 --> 18:50.829
Later, Ralph,
I'm watching the race!

18:50.829 --> 18:53.465
Lisa's
going to pass him!

18:59.338 --> 19:00.839
Aaaah!

19:02.541 --> 19:06.645
Hey, what's the big idea?

19:06.645 --> 19:07.646
Bert!

19:09.781 --> 19:11.783
Lisa, are you okay?

19:11.783 --> 19:14.620
Yeah. But I'm out of
this race, thanks to Rod.

19:14.620 --> 19:17.956
He did this?! And
you could have won the race!!

19:17.956 --> 19:19.458
Why he outta be...

19:19.458 --> 19:21.960
Oh, forget it, Bert.
You're our only hope now!

19:21.960 --> 19:24.129
Me?!
Bert, you can do it.

19:24.129 --> 19:26.632
You can take this guy. Go!!

19:26.632 --> 19:29.868
I can see them again.
But, but what happened to Lisa?

19:29.868 --> 19:32.037
Rod's all alone in first place,

19:32.037 --> 19:34.173
and he doesn't look
like he's in any hurry.

19:39.378 --> 19:41.713
Oooh!

19:41.713 --> 19:43.615
Wait,
something's happening.

19:43.615 --> 19:44.650
Why, it's.. it's...

19:44.650 --> 19:46.385
It's who? It's who?!

19:50.122 --> 19:51.823
This race isn't over yet!

19:51.823 --> 19:53.492
It is for you!

19:53.492 --> 19:56.061
It's too late
for those tricks!

19:56.061 --> 19:57.796
They're even now!

19:57.796 --> 20:00.866
They're coming into the
home stretch! Here they come!

20:04.970 --> 20:06.171
Hey!

20:09.241 --> 20:11.009
What?

20:12.277 --> 20:13.745
He did it!

20:13.745 --> 20:16.748
Bert won! Oh, what a race!!

20:18.183 --> 20:20.986
Oh Ralph, quit fooling around!

20:20.986 --> 20:23.121
Thank you! Thank you!

20:23.121 --> 20:25.390
Thank you very much!

20:28.193 --> 20:30.562
And thank you!!

20:40.405 --> 20:42.708
The Evergreen
Triathlon turned out

20:42.708 --> 20:45.277
to be the sporting event
of the year.

20:45.277 --> 20:46.912
And thanks to Bert Raccoon,

20:46.912 --> 20:49.581
Cedric not only got
his prize money back,

20:49.581 --> 20:51.550
but much, much more.

20:51.550 --> 20:52.918
Look,
I'll let you work out

20:52.918 --> 20:55.187
the details with my new partner.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.556
Yeah, I decided the
business around here

20:57.556 --> 20:59.992
is too much for one
person to handle.

20:59.992 --> 21:02.527
Hang on, I'll transfer
you over to his office.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.465
It's for you, partner.
Thanks, partner!

21:07.032 --> 21:10.802
Knox? Heh, yeah, well,
retirement wasn't for me.

21:10.802 --> 21:12.471
Now, about that TV deal,

21:12.471 --> 21:15.540
how about we discuss it over
a game of golf this afternoon?

21:16.475 --> 21:18.110
Ohh, too busy, eh?

21:18.110 --> 21:20.979
Ha, listen Knox,
you've got to slow down

21:20.979 --> 21:22.414
and take things a bit easier!

21:24.283 --> 21:26.918
Bills, junk mail, bills...

21:26.918 --> 21:29.121
Hmm. What's this?

21:29.121 --> 21:30.589
For me?

21:30.589 --> 21:34.092
To the rightful
winner, from Bert Raccoon.

21:35.560 --> 21:36.595
The gold medal?!

21:37.829 --> 21:38.930
Thank you, Bert.

21:39.731 --> 21:40.732
Thank you.

21:48.307 --> 22:01.153
â™ª When darkness falls â™ª

22:01.153 --> 22:04.356
â™ª Leaving shadows in the night â™ª

22:04.356 --> 22:07.726
â™ª Don't be afraid â™ª

22:07.726 --> 22:11.263
â™ª Wipe that fear from
your eyes â™ª

22:11.263 --> 22:14.566
â™ª The desperate love â™ª

22:14.566 --> 22:18.070
â™ª Keeps on driving you wrong â™ª

22:18.070 --> 22:22.841
â™ª Don't be afraid â™ª

22:22.841 --> 22:24.409
â™ª You're not alone â™ª

22:24.409 --> 22:28.113
â™ª You can run with us â™ª

22:28.113 --> 22:33.585
â™ª We've got everything
you need â™ª

22:33.585 --> 22:35.020
â™ª Run with us â™ª

22:35.020 --> 22:38.690
â™ª We are free â™ª

22:38.690 --> 22:42.194
â™ª Come with us â™ª

22:42.194 --> 22:47.499
â™ª I see passion in your eyes â™ª

22:47.499 --> 22:49.167
â™ª Come with us â™ª
