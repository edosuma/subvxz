02:43.488 --> 02:44.956
You are very brave.

02:45.998 --> 02:48.364
To be brave for doing something.

02:48.633 --> 02:52.290
You live in Rome,
then you are brave.

02:52.481 --> 02:53.482
Okay, okay.

02:53.676 --> 02:54.961
First of all.

02:56.123 --> 02:57.020
Good.

02:57.263 --> 02:58.731
What did you do this morning?

02:58.836 --> 03:04.116
This morning I had some work to do

03:04.320 --> 03:07.806
'cause I'm still preparing
this new project.

03:09.266 --> 03:14.989
We are waiting for the money,
as usual it's not easy,

03:17.769 --> 03:21.295
but I'm confident
we're gonna find it.

03:21.484 --> 03:26.883
So, for homework.

03:27.313 --> 03:31.308
Write ten sentences
in past continuous tense

03:31.435 --> 03:33.844
using verbs you like.

03:34.036 --> 03:39.344
Any verb you choose, the important
is that is past continuous.

03:39.609 --> 03:42.396
Okay, wait.

03:43.259 --> 03:44.693
I have a little thing for you.

03:45.043 --> 03:48.689
Turn around, it's a surprise.

How's the baby?

05:31.206 --> 05:32.595
Good.

05:33.993 --> 05:35.255
Does she speak Italian?

05:35.667 --> 05:39.593
Yes, but also Moldavian, English.

05:41.035 --> 05:43.091
Bits of them together.

05:45.334 --> 05:49.520
It's complicated,
'cause I don't understand Moldavian.

05:49.584 --> 05:52.119
- It's the mother's fault.
- Yes!

05:52.911 --> 05:54.077

06:25.517 --> 06:30.988
It's not the season
for radicchio trevigiano, right?

06:31.049 --> 06:34.001
No, trevigiano is not now.

06:42.108 --> 06:46.826
I'll come back tomorrow
for pineapple and beans.

08:31.854 --> 08:34.056

that she's, like,

08:34.089 --> 08:36.457
gonna take this little clay

08:36.491 --> 08:39.061
and put it

if it's gonna last...

08:55.544 --> 08:59.481
Hey, when I... when I speak
to you in Italian, help me!

08:59.515 --> 09:01.483
Please don't answer
in English, huh?

09:01.517 --> 09:03.652
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:06.789 --> 09:08.724
(bubbling)

09:14.730 --> 09:16.431
- All right.

09:16.465 --> 09:18.834

09:22.571 --> 09:24.006
Yeah, no.

09:26.108 --> 09:27.442
Okay?

09:27.476 --> 09:29.011

10:31.773 --> 10:32.741
Yeah?

10:34.142 --> 10:36.945
Nikki, do you want a lot?

10:36.979 --> 10:39.715
Are you hungry?

10:39.748 --> 10:41.617
This.

10:41.650 --> 10:43.118
Put it.

10:44.953 --> 10:47.456
(baby babbling)

10:48.991 --> 10:51.426

13:18.240 --> 13:20.242

- Yes.

13:20.276 --> 13:22.711
- Easy?
- Finally.

13:22.744 --> 13:24.980
- Is she asleep?
- Finally asleep.

13:27.015 --> 13:30.353
I'm reading this thing,
I don't know...

13:30.386 --> 13:32.220
What is it about?

13:32.255 --> 13:34.122
No, it's, um, you know,

13:34.156 --> 13:36.958
it's the section with,
uh, you know,

13:36.992 --> 13:38.994
the thing that you...
the feeling is

13:39.027 --> 13:41.863
they traverse the galaxy
and now on the other side,

13:41.897 --> 13:44.699
they're... it's only
two inhabitants.

13:44.733 --> 13:46.701
All that is heard is
the sound of their breath.

13:46.735 --> 13:49.104
Mother asleep by bar,
covered up and warm,

13:49.137 --> 13:50.872
but now appears.

13:50.906 --> 13:52.808

before Russian girl.

13:52.841 --> 13:54.042
That part.

13:54.076 --> 13:55.610
(laughing)

13:55.644 --> 13:58.713
I just don't know
whether it's, um...

13:58.747 --> 14:00.182
too sentimental, or...

14:00.215 --> 14:02.717
And also, I...

14:02.751 --> 14:05.654
- No, it seems so sweet.
- I don't know...

14:05.687 --> 14:07.356
- You like it?
- Yes.

14:07.390 --> 14:10.192
I think it's very...

14:10.225 --> 14:12.894
It's like a dream, it's like...

14:14.696 --> 14:19.701
...something, you know,
out of this world.

14:19.734 --> 14:22.771
At least, you know,
you have a purpose to...

14:22.804 --> 14:24.307
No, I think...
I don't know.

14:24.340 --> 14:26.808
There's something wrong
about it, I don't know.

14:26.842 --> 14:29.111
I had something else
I wanted to...

14:30.212 --> 14:31.380
(sighs)

14:33.849 --> 14:35.150
How are you?

14:35.183 --> 14:36.385
(chuckling)

14:36.419 --> 14:38.220
I'm tired.

14:38.254 --> 14:40.956
- Yeah?
- I'm tired.

14:40.989 --> 14:44.293
I'm tired, you know,
she's really...

14:44.327 --> 14:47.896
- She seems good, though, huh?
- She's good, but she's...

14:47.929 --> 14:51.666
You know, it's not like
you just stay with her.

14:51.700 --> 14:53.835
- I know.
- You really gotta be very...

14:53.869 --> 14:58.441
all your focus is only
the baby, the baby, the baby.

14:58.474 --> 15:00.309
- I know, I know, I know.
- You forgot about...

15:00.343 --> 15:01.877
I know it better than anyone.

15:01.910 --> 15:06.014
- Yes.
- I think, you know, it's normal

15:06.047 --> 15:09.252
with a baby, but, you know,
you just gotta...

15:11.454 --> 15:13.422
Unless you aren't happy
with me anymore.

15:13.456 --> 15:15.358
(laughing)

15:15.391 --> 15:16.858
You don't even know.

15:16.892 --> 15:18.960
- Sometimes.
- I know, I know.

15:18.994 --> 15:21.129
- Sometimes.
- Wrong question.

15:21.163 --> 15:24.766
Sometimes I am...

15:24.799 --> 15:27.702
You know, sometimes you
just don't talk with me,

15:27.736 --> 15:30.138
you don't communicate with me,

15:30.172 --> 15:31.840
you don't...

15:31.873 --> 15:33.476
- I know.
- You know...

15:33.509 --> 15:36.445
- We get busy.
- You're so busy,

15:36.479 --> 15:40.449
and you forget about
that I'm a woman

15:40.483 --> 15:42.150
and I'm different.

15:42.184 --> 15:44.986
Okay, well, what should I know?

15:45.020 --> 15:46.821
(chuckling)

15:46.855 --> 15:48.357
Hmm?

15:48.391 --> 15:49.425
Yeah.

15:49.458 --> 15:51.760
You forget I'm a man, huh?

15:51.793 --> 15:54.430
This is what I'm talking about.

15:54.463 --> 15:56.965
I forget you're a man also

15:56.998 --> 15:59.868
because I have this little...

15:59.901 --> 16:01.102
baby.

16:01.136 --> 16:02.237
I know.

16:03.439 --> 16:05.073
Us.

16:21.390 --> 16:23.259
She's asleep now.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.127
Not here.

16:33.201 --> 16:34.869
Touch.

16:36.838 --> 16:38.274
It's so nice.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.440
Oh, such a beautiful ass.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.809
Oh, baby.

18:42.665 --> 18:45.301
- <i>Mama.</i>
- Wait.

18:45.334 --> 18:47.470
- The baby.
- What? The baby.

18:47.503 --> 18:48.604
Yes.

18:50.171 --> 18:52.274
- Wait a second.
- <i>Mama, Mama.</i>

19:18.334 --> 19:20.369
Oh! It's okay?

19:20.403 --> 19:23.238
Okay, sorry, I walked too fast.

19:23.272 --> 19:25.974
(speaking Italian)

19:29.445 --> 19:31.614
(chains squeaking)

19:41.490 --> 19:43.091
Okay.

19:44.225 --> 19:45.694
(speaking Italian)

19:45.728 --> 19:47.263
More?

19:49.102 --> 19:51.364
Elisa, don't be angry.

19:51.451 --> 19:52.906
I am angry.

19:54.665 --> 19:56.562
Go hug Anna.

19:56.772 --> 19:58.973
(speaking Italian)

20:03.050 --> 20:04.471
She is jealous...

20:04.657 --> 20:07.993
She's angry 'cause Anna
doesn't want to give her the bubbles.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.204
Anna, give her the bubbles.

20:15.724 --> 20:18.159
DeeDee.

20:18.193 --> 20:19.662
So fancy.

20:19.695 --> 20:21.497
What do you think?

to go get ice cream?

(speaking Italian)

23:15.537 --> 23:18.307
Oh my God, you look so good!

23:18.340 --> 23:20.776
Where have you been,
what you did?

23:20.809 --> 23:23.545
- Gelato.
- Gelato, fragola?

23:23.579 --> 23:24.546
Fragola.

23:28.684 --> 23:30.853
Lisa... Lisa cried?

23:30.886 --> 23:32.488
Lisa cried?

23:32.521 --> 23:35.223
(speaking foreign languages)

23:35.257 --> 23:36.792
Why Lisa cried?

23:36.825 --> 23:38.293
Oh my God.

23:38.327 --> 23:40.194
It's okay.

23:40.228 --> 23:41.730
We're gonna come back.

23:41.764 --> 23:44.733
Yes, we're gonna still play
with her.

23:44.767 --> 23:47.201
I gotta do something
real quick, okay?

23:47.235 --> 23:48.570
Yes.

23:51.774 --> 23:53.676
Let's wash our hands.

23:55.310 --> 23:57.680
(water running)

23:57.713 --> 24:00.214
(speaking foreign language)

24:07.623 --> 24:10.392
(mellow music)

24:24.273 --> 24:26.542
<i>Exterior: snow country, day.</i>

24:26.575 --> 24:29.845
<i>Credits over wild
winter landscape.</i>

24:29.878 --> 24:32.715
<i>When I had been pondering
many things to myself</i>

24:32.748 --> 24:35.350
<i>for a long time
and had for many days</i>

24:35.384 --> 24:39.254
<i>been seeking my own self
and what my own good was</i>

24:39.288 --> 24:41.824
<i>and what evil
was to be avoided,</i>

24:41.857 --> 24:44.326
<i>it suddenly spoke to me.</i>

24:44.359 --> 24:45.561
<i>What was it?</i>

24:45.594 --> 24:47.963
<i>I, myself, or someone else,</i>

24:47.996 --> 24:50.699
<i>inside or outside me.</i>

24:50.733 --> 24:54.503
<i>This is the very thing
I would love to know</i>

24:54.536 --> 24:55.904
<i>but don't.</i>

24:55.938 --> 24:57.873
(wind whistling)

25:08.050 --> 25:09.985
(dogs barking)

25:26.401 --> 25:28.337
(speaking foreign language)

25:32.374 --> 25:34.676
(percussive music)

25:36.578 --> 25:38.981
(pounding)

25:43.418 --> 25:45.954
(shouting)

25:53.562 --> 25:55.731
Sexy, beautiful, stupid.

25:55.764 --> 25:58.433
(speaking Italian)

25:58.505 --> 26:04.685
It's important to find the gesture
in an organic way,

26:05.184 --> 26:08.188
a simple way.

26:09.538 --> 26:12.180
I like this movement.

26:13.948 --> 26:15.036
Two...

26:17.428 --> 26:20.941
Go back to the circle.

26:21.012 --> 26:22.785
Three, keep going.

26:23.392 --> 26:26.328
(laughter)

26:33.602 --> 26:35.871
I want to say,

26:35.904 --> 26:39.508
the idea is,
these are all simple games,

26:39.541 --> 26:45.414
but I like very much the idea
of distraction,

26:45.447 --> 26:48.517
the double...
the double focus that you have,

26:48.550 --> 26:50.652
because you're all... for me,

26:50.686 --> 26:55.924
performing is always
between control and abandon.

26:58.760 --> 27:03.432
Okay. Um, so when we do some
of these distracting things,

27:03.465 --> 27:05.567
things that don't seem
to go together,

27:05.601 --> 27:07.936
it makes you feel off-balance,

27:07.970 --> 27:09.838
but if you can relax
in that state,

27:09.872 --> 27:11.907
it makes you
more emotionally available.

27:11.940 --> 27:13.942
(translating in Italian)

27:19.448 --> 27:23.418
Your job is to approach
that... that action that you know

27:23.452 --> 27:27.022
with a way that's not to show
but to do,

27:27.055 --> 27:30.525
to do the action,
do the action in a pure way,

27:30.559 --> 27:33.962
so the action is born,
and when the action is born,

27:33.996 --> 27:35.530
you have a reaction to it,

27:35.564 --> 27:37.866
and that propels you
to something.

27:37.900 --> 27:40.502
But it's sometimes
imitated emotion

27:40.535 --> 27:41.770
or demonstrated emotion,

27:41.803 --> 27:44.439
not really felt emotion
or experience.

27:44.473 --> 27:48.510
If you're only doing
emotional things

27:48.543 --> 27:52.080
that you feel safe with,
it's... it's for you.

27:52.114 --> 27:53.949
It's... you gotta go
beyond yourself.

27:53.982 --> 27:55.851
- Okay.
- We all know it in life.

27:55.884 --> 27:58.153
When we do things
and we forget about ourselves

27:58.186 --> 28:02.024
and we're just doing
the action in a pure way,

28:02.057 --> 28:06.628
that's when we get closer
to experiencing, for me,

28:06.662 --> 28:08.130
the beauty of life.

28:08.163 --> 28:10.432
(peaceful music)

28:51.807 --> 28:54.609
<i>So I'm making this movie
in Miami</i>

28:54.643 --> 29:00.916
<i>and I'm... I'm deep
into using crack cocaine.</i>

29:00.949 --> 29:03.118
<i>I'm drinking, heroin.</i>

29:03.151 --> 29:04.786
<i>I'm out, I'm out.</i>

29:04.820 --> 29:07.723
Hey! Good to see you.

29:07.756 --> 29:09.258
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Good to see you.

29:09.292 --> 29:10.692
It's hot, but...

29:10.726 --> 29:11.960
Look at that fucking water.

29:11.994 --> 29:12.828
(laughing)

29:12.861 --> 29:14.029
Like a beer.

29:14.062 --> 29:15.197
I'll see you down there
in a minute.

29:15.230 --> 29:16.265
Yeah.

29:21.169 --> 29:26.708
<i>You know, and we're making
this movie in Miami</i>

29:26.742 --> 29:30.178
<i>at a time that Miami is, like,
the nightlife is exploding,</i>

29:30.212 --> 29:32.714
<i>and just made a movie...</i>

29:32.748 --> 29:34.850
<i>I don't have
my regular people with me.</i>

29:34.883 --> 29:39.121
<i>I gotta make a movie that's
gonna be the first video...</i>

29:39.154 --> 29:41.089
<i>movie shot with a video camera.</i>

29:41.123 --> 29:44.092
<i>I'm feeling really like it's...
I'm it, you know, I'm...</i>

29:44.126 --> 29:46.895
<i>my ego is like,
"I'm gonna do this thing,"</i>

29:46.928 --> 29:49.898
<i>and not only...
I'm gonna make a remake</i>

29:49.931 --> 29:52.167
of La Dolce Vita.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.636
American remake,

29:54.669 --> 29:57.906
and I got this young Cuban actor

29:57.939 --> 30:01.576
and, uh, he's, uh,
he's down with it

30:01.610 --> 30:05.281
and he's also...
when I get there, you know,

30:05.314 --> 30:08.317
the guy's in rehab,
but I'm good with that,

30:08.351 --> 30:10.986
and I just gotta get him
out of rehab, and I do.

30:11.019 --> 30:14.290
I get him out of rehab.
I remember I even, you know,

30:14.323 --> 30:16.658
bringing him stuff
when he wasn't in rehab.

30:16.691 --> 30:20.896
He'd meet us outside...
outside the place,

30:20.929 --> 30:22.998
like middle of the night,
it was crazy.

30:23.031 --> 30:24.766
But I needed this kid.

30:24.800 --> 30:28.703
And, uh, one day, I'm...
I'm working on the set

30:28.737 --> 30:33.208
and I see this extra,
this chick, she's good looking.

30:33.241 --> 30:35.143
You know, I shouldn't be
messing with her,

30:35.177 --> 30:39.214
but I'm... I'm it, I'm having...
I can do whatever I want, right?

30:39.247 --> 30:41.716
I'm feeling strong
and I'm prancing.

30:41.750 --> 30:43.985
So I go out with her,
we're out late,

30:44.019 --> 30:47.022
and I go to my friend's place
that's got an all-night...

30:47.055 --> 30:50.125
it's like a diner,
but it's a hip place, you know,

30:50.158 --> 30:53.095
it's like a cool, fancy place.

30:53.128 --> 30:57.732
I get in there, I lay some...
a hundred dollar bill on the bar

30:57.766 --> 30:59.768
and I say,
"Hey, buy these guys a drink."

30:59.801 --> 31:03.071
I go in, go out with
the owner of the place

31:03.105 --> 31:07.042
to do some stuff,
and when I come back,

31:07.075 --> 31:09.345
the chick's not there.

31:09.378 --> 31:11.913
Uh, you know,

31:11.947 --> 31:13.915
she's gone,
and the guy says,

31:13.949 --> 31:15.318
"Hey, who's gonna pay
for the drinks?"

31:15.351 --> 31:16.985
I said, "I left a hundred."

31:17.018 --> 31:19.688
He said, "No, no,
I didn't see any hundred."

31:19.721 --> 31:22.224
So I'm really pissed,
I get on the phone,

31:22.258 --> 31:24.960
and I get her number and I say,
"You fucking bitch!"

31:24.993 --> 31:27.162
You know,
really chew her out nasty,

31:27.195 --> 31:29.831
like mean, like crazy,
like, you know,

31:29.865 --> 31:34.002
she betrayed this... this guy
that was happening, you know.

31:34.035 --> 31:36.972
What I didn't know is
this girl had a boyfriend,

31:37.005 --> 31:41.109
and her boyfriend was crazy
about what she was doing

31:41.143 --> 31:44.779
with these movie people,
and he was crazy jealous.

31:44.813 --> 31:48.150
She talked about, you know,
being afraid of this guy.

31:48.183 --> 31:52.154
Well, I go back
to my South Beach motel,

31:52.187 --> 31:54.323
I forgot
to double lock the door,

31:54.357 --> 31:58.093
and I think I'm dreaming,

31:58.126 --> 32:00.028
I go to bed
and I think I'm dreaming

32:00.061 --> 32:02.265
that some guy's beating
the shit out of me.

32:02.298 --> 32:05.901
Wailing away on me,
just slamming me in the face.

32:05.934 --> 32:07.403
But I'm not dreaming.

32:07.436 --> 32:10.939
This guy came in,
he's the boyfriend,

32:10.972 --> 32:13.342
he's fucking, you know,
cursing me out

32:13.376 --> 32:16.745
about what I did to the girl,
and he's beating me really bad.

32:16.778 --> 32:20.148
My face is all blown up,
I mean, like this.

32:20.182 --> 32:25.354
The guy leaves, they grab me,
bring me to the hospital,

32:25.388 --> 32:27.856
you know, nobody's there,
I'm all alone, you know,

32:27.889 --> 32:31.193
and I'm messed up,
and my ego is so crazy

32:31.226 --> 32:34.029
that I also think
that they want to kill me,

32:34.062 --> 32:36.332
you know, I get
these paranoid thoughts of...

32:36.365 --> 32:39.234
All I can think about
is being safe.

32:39.268 --> 32:45.274
So, I... I hear that
there's a rehab place

32:45.308 --> 32:47.310
in this hospital
on the third floor,

32:47.343 --> 32:50.379
and it's kind of a lockdown,
like, only family can come,

32:50.413 --> 32:53.848
so I go into rehab.

32:53.882 --> 32:55.150
(laughter)

32:55.183 --> 32:58.354
But I have no intention
of getting sober.

32:58.387 --> 33:01.424
None at all, I mean, this...
all this shit happens.

33:01.457 --> 33:03.326
I almost die, you know.

33:03.359 --> 33:06.462
Still, I don't get the idea
that, you know,

33:06.495 --> 33:08.297
what I'm doing is a problem.

33:08.331 --> 33:10.031
I'm still bigger than that,

33:10.065 --> 33:11.933
I'm still more important
than that.

33:11.967 --> 33:13.835
It still isn't occurring to me.

33:13.868 --> 33:16.171
It fucking...
it's hard to believe.

33:16.204 --> 33:18.940
I mean, this is 12 years before.

33:18.974 --> 33:20.208
So...

33:22.210 --> 33:23.812
You know, I go in this place,

33:23.845 --> 33:27.283
and I'm still using,
and my dealer's coming.

33:27.316 --> 33:29.117
You know, my face
starts to heal,

33:29.150 --> 33:32.153
and I'm feeling
like I can do it again,

33:32.187 --> 33:38.226
so it's just, you know,
amazing that it took me so long.

33:38.261 --> 33:42.797
I mean, yesterday
was my birthday.

33:42.831 --> 33:44.567
It's been six years.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.535
(applause)

33:48.304 --> 33:50.473
And, you know,

33:50.506 --> 33:53.342
I want to thank everybody.

33:53.376 --> 33:56.811
Also, something
magical happened,

33:56.845 --> 33:59.214
or at least for me
it was magical,

33:59.247 --> 34:03.985
that last month,
um, a guy came,

34:04.019 --> 34:08.223
he was a tourist
from the States,

34:08.257 --> 34:11.059
and he came to the meeting,
he came here,

34:11.092 --> 34:16.965
and afterwards, we were outside
and he came up to me,

34:16.998 --> 34:21.002
and he said, you know,

34:21.036 --> 34:24.572
"I was... I was your doctor,
I was your counselor

34:24.607 --> 34:28.344
in rehab in Miami, and, uh,

34:28.377 --> 34:32.112
I followed... I followed, uh...

34:32.147 --> 34:35.850
I followed your movies
and I followed you, and I...

34:35.884 --> 34:39.388
I just want to say that, um,

34:39.422 --> 34:42.358
I'm happy to see you alive."

34:42.391 --> 34:47.496
And I said, "Thank you,"
and that was really beautiful.

34:47.530 --> 34:49.398
And thank you all.

34:49.431 --> 34:51.966
(applause)

34:57.238 --> 34:59.475
Okay, so the time's
beaten us once again.

34:59.508 --> 35:02.210
Folks, we'll finish
with the Serenity Prayer.

35:08.917 --> 35:10.586
- God...
- God...

35:10.619 --> 35:15.324
grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change,

35:15.358 --> 35:17.660
the courage to change
the things I can,

35:17.693 --> 35:20.061
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

35:20.095 --> 35:22.431
Keep coming back,
it works if you work it,

35:22.465 --> 35:24.199
so work it,
you're worth it.

35:24.232 --> 35:25.233
(laughing)

35:25.267 --> 35:26.635
Well done, man. Good job.

35:26.669 --> 35:28.337
Congratulations.

35:28.371 --> 35:29.904
(unintelligible)

35:29.938 --> 35:31.172
Keep coming back.

35:31.206 --> 35:34.175
- Happy birthday, thanks.
- Happy birthday.

35:34.209 --> 35:35.511
Hey.

35:35.544 --> 35:37.946
(crosstalk)

35:37.979 --> 35:39.348
Hey.

35:39.382 --> 35:41.916
(crosstalk)

35:41.950 --> 35:44.152
(mellow music)

35:51.327 --> 35:53.228
(crickets chirring)

35:53.262 --> 35:56.231
(speaking foreign language)

35:56.265 --> 35:58.099
You're never gonna fall.

35:58.133 --> 36:00.068
Okay, we're here, we're here.

36:01.069 --> 36:02.671
(unintelligible)

36:02.705 --> 36:04.072
Okay, okay.

36:04.105 --> 36:05.307
Goodnight, moon!

36:05.341 --> 36:07.410
Goodnight, we go to sleep!

36:07.443 --> 36:09.210
(kissing)

36:10.145 --> 36:11.913
(laughing)

36:13.482 --> 36:15.016
Okay.

37:09.672 --> 37:12.040
(traffic sounds)

37:15.478 --> 37:18.012
(doors closing)

37:28.156 --> 37:31.327
(dark music)

37:31.360 --> 37:33.995
(footsteps echoing)

37:52.146 --> 37:55.083
(metal clinking)

38:29.485 --> 38:35.257
So you've been making speeches
to the crowd in the piazza.

38:37.393 --> 38:39.662
I only told some people

38:39.695 --> 38:45.166
that the temple
of old laws must fall

38:45.199 --> 38:48.837
and a new temple of truth
should be built.

38:48.871 --> 38:50.573
But don't take me literally.

38:50.606 --> 38:54.577
I'm just trying
to make myself understood.

38:54.610 --> 38:58.647
Why is someone like you
upsetting the people?

38:58.681 --> 39:00.449
Why?

39:00.482 --> 39:03.652
You think you know the truth?

39:05.186 --> 39:06.789
What is truth?

39:11.260 --> 39:13.529
The truth is,

39:13.562 --> 39:14.863
you're in pain.

39:14.897 --> 39:16.365
You have a terrible headache

39:16.398 --> 39:18.867
and you're thinking of suicide.

39:19.935 --> 39:21.403
You can barely look at me.

39:21.437 --> 39:23.839
The way you look at me
disturbs me.

39:23.872 --> 39:26.909
I don't want to be a torturer.

39:26.942 --> 39:31.547
But this feeling will go away.

39:31.580 --> 39:32.815
It will.

39:34.550 --> 39:36.318
It's going away.

39:40.923 --> 39:42.658
This feeling...

39:44.693 --> 39:46.495
...it's going away.

39:46.528 --> 39:50.131
It is, it's going away.

39:51.533 --> 39:53.335
It's going away.

39:58.273 --> 40:01.910
You should go take
a walk in the park.

40:01.944 --> 40:05.347
Totally up to you.
I could come with you.

40:05.381 --> 40:08.249
You seem like
an intelligent man.

40:10.352 --> 40:13.221
The trouble with you is
your mind is closed.

40:13.255 --> 40:15.658
You lack empathy.

40:15.691 --> 40:18.226
You only care for your dog.

40:21.330 --> 40:23.197
(speaking Italian)

40:24.366 --> 40:25.668
(keys jingling)

40:27.469 --> 40:29.505
(handcuffs unlocking)

40:47.022 --> 40:50.325
Tell me, are you a doctor?

40:50.359 --> 40:52.861
No, I'm not a doctor.

40:53.830 --> 40:56.589
How do you know that
I was thinking to pet my dog?

40:58.801 --> 41:01.737
Because you made a gesture

41:01.770 --> 41:04.673
as if to stroke something,

41:04.707 --> 41:06.508
and your lips...

41:09.445 --> 41:11.513
You are a doctor.

41:12.347 --> 41:14.248
No.

41:14.283 --> 41:16.285
I'm not a doctor.

41:27.730 --> 41:30.265
(breathing heavily)

42:20.082 --> 42:22.618
(puffing)

42:32.094 --> 42:33.862
(speaking foreign language)

42:49.845 --> 42:51.847
Ah, okay.

42:51.880 --> 42:53.882
You think it's
too heavy for you?

42:53.916 --> 42:55.984
No, Mama is gonna carry it.

42:56.018 --> 42:58.453
It's too heavy for you
to take, I know.

43:00.422 --> 43:02.591
Okay, now...

43:04.593 --> 43:06.728
Tommaso?

43:06.762 --> 43:09.131
- Yeah?
- We are about to leave.

43:09.164 --> 43:11.900
- You're going?
- Yup.

43:11.934 --> 43:14.903
- Okay.
- We're going to Nonna's.

43:14.937 --> 43:17.639
(speaking Italian)

43:18.874 --> 43:21.009
You sure you don't want to come?

43:21.043 --> 43:22.778
You sure you don't want
to come with us?

43:22.811 --> 43:24.713
No, I got...
I got too much to do.

43:24.746 --> 43:25.848
(laughing)

43:25.881 --> 43:27.583
- You know.
- Come on, you...

43:27.616 --> 43:30.385
Let me call you a cab, okay?
Did you call a cab?

43:30.419 --> 43:32.120
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm gonna go with the metro.

43:32.154 --> 43:33.822
No, no, no, it's too far.

43:33.856 --> 43:35.557
It's too far. Let me call.

43:35.591 --> 43:38.393
- No, no, listen...
- No, it's too far for the baby,

43:38.427 --> 43:39.661
and that's
a freaky neighborhood.

43:39.695 --> 43:41.864
I'm gonna take the metro
and I'm...

43:41.897 --> 43:44.166
- I'm calling a taxi.
- No, please don't call it.

43:44.199 --> 43:45.534
Please.

43:45.567 --> 43:46.668
(speaking Italian)

43:46.702 --> 43:47.669
No, please.

43:47.703 --> 43:50.772
(speaking Italian)

43:50.806 --> 43:52.040
- No.
- No, it's okay.

43:52.074 --> 43:53.575
No, I'm gonna take the metro.

43:53.609 --> 43:55.477
- Are you kidding me?
- Grazie.

43:55.510 --> 43:58.180
No, it's gonna... it's gonna come
in just a little...

43:58.213 --> 44:00.716
- Give me some money, please.
- Oh, okay, yeah.

44:00.749 --> 44:03.719
But I'm not gonna take the cab.

44:03.752 --> 44:06.622
I wanna take the metro.
It's cool.

44:06.655 --> 44:08.123
I'm really cool with that.

44:08.156 --> 44:09.958
- It's coming.
- No, really.

44:09.992 --> 44:13.528
- I'm calling you a taxi.
- Tommaso, don't do this to me.

44:13.562 --> 44:15.331
I'm really good with it.

44:19.201 --> 44:20.602
(car honks)

44:40.088 --> 44:42.925
(speaking Italian)

44:56.238 --> 44:57.773
Wow, okay.

45:05.647 --> 45:06.815
Okay.

45:07.272 --> 45:08.280
Are you tired?

45:10.336 --> 45:12.471
Do we want to finish earlier?

45:12.921 --> 45:13.956
No...

45:14.256 --> 45:17.776
Earlier I had a fight with Nikki

45:17.850 --> 45:23.372
'cause she wanted to get the subway
with the baby

45:23.436 --> 45:25.825
and I don't like that...

45:26.812 --> 45:27.920
It's hard,

45:29.192 --> 45:32.928
maybe it's my problem, but...

45:33.979 --> 45:40.582
Lately I believe

45:40.670 --> 45:44.329
that we should stay more relaxed.

45:44.766 --> 45:47.809
- Me?
- In general, not you.

45:50.137 --> 45:51.677
I'm trying to learn...

45:52.894 --> 45:54.629
(speaking Italian)

45:56.413 --> 46:01.475
I've learned
some breathing exercises.

46:01.564 --> 46:03.659
I can't do that.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.257
- You?
- Tommaso, for me it's impossible.

46:06.346 --> 46:08.512
I can't do the breathing.

46:08.710 --> 46:10.245
Inhale in.

46:12.180 --> 46:16.785
Bring it down to that point
of meeting down here.

46:20.256 --> 46:24.593
Switch, the other nostril,

46:24.626 --> 46:26.995
then bring the energy up.

46:30.732 --> 46:32.301
And then send it up

46:32.335 --> 46:35.003
through the crown of your head
with your diaphragm.

46:35.037 --> 46:37.273
- Okay, we'll breathe together.
- Mm-hmm.

46:37.306 --> 46:39.841
(inhaling)

46:42.844 --> 46:44.212
Hold.

46:45.348 --> 46:47.983
(exhaling)

46:51.801 --> 46:55.842
You stop the breath here.

46:56.537 --> 46:57.799
It's only...

46:59.194 --> 47:01.297
(exhaling)

47:03.198 --> 47:04.232
Okay.

47:04.267 --> 47:06.034
(speaking Italian)

47:06.735 --> 47:09.155
I must immediately find
a meditation teacher,

47:11.138 --> 47:12.781
I must learn.

47:14.400 --> 47:15.741
When am I gonna see you?

47:18.621 --> 47:20.282
Friday, great.

47:20.564 --> 47:22.495
Have a good day.

47:24.086 --> 47:25.654
(door opening)

47:25.687 --> 47:27.856
(light music)

47:59.154 --> 48:01.089
(traffic sounds)

48:20.242 --> 48:22.777
(bells chiming)

48:32.954 --> 48:34.756
(beeping)

48:45.000 --> 48:46.801
(speaking Italian)

48:52.408 --> 48:54.709
<i>Nikki? Tommaso.</i>

48:56.312 --> 48:58.813
- <i>Yo.</i>
- Nikki, what...

48:58.847 --> 49:00.283
<i>What? Why are you calling?</i>

49:00.316 --> 49:02.017
I, you know,
I've been calling you

49:02.050 --> 49:03.952
and you didn't pick up,
what the fuck?

49:03.985 --> 49:05.354
I mean, come on.

49:05.388 --> 49:07.756
- <i>What, what?</i>
- I've been trying to reach you,

49:07.789 --> 49:09.824
I've probably called you
50 times.

49:09.858 --> 49:12.160
<i>I just forgot the charger
of my phone, are you serious?</i>

49:12.194 --> 49:14.297
Either you don't pick up
or it goes to voice mail.

49:14.330 --> 49:15.931
What the fuck?
I mean, I worry.

49:15.964 --> 49:17.966
What if something happened
to the baby?

49:17.999 --> 49:20.336
- It's not funny.
- <i>Well, you don't have to worry.</i>

49:20.369 --> 49:23.038
You know, don't act like
a fucking kid, you know?

49:23.071 --> 49:24.440
You got some responsibilities.

49:24.473 --> 49:27.042
I worry about,
you know, I worry...

49:27.075 --> 49:29.978
So please, don't...
don't do that again, okay?

49:30.011 --> 49:31.880
<i>Everything is fine,
don't worry.</i>

49:31.913 --> 49:34.216
- <i>I just forgot the charger.</i>
- Okay, pick up next time.

49:34.249 --> 49:35.884
- <i>Okay, okay.</i>
- Okay.

49:35.917 --> 49:37.420
- Ciao, ciao.
- <i>Ciao.</i>

49:38.354 --> 49:39.355
(groans)

49:39.788 --> 49:41.066
My wife...

49:41.719 --> 49:47.895
she left the phone charger at home

49:47.947 --> 49:50.520
and it's been impossible
to reach her.

49:50.616 --> 49:53.116
She is with the baby,

49:53.787 --> 49:55.453
I started worrying,

49:55.546 --> 49:58.181
so I had to call my mother-in-law.

49:58.692 --> 50:00.367
You had to call all around.

50:01.310 --> 50:02.811
(groans)

50:02.844 --> 50:04.212
Okay.

50:06.582 --> 50:08.750
(speaking Italian)

50:12.120 --> 50:13.855
(money crinkling)

50:15.324 --> 50:16.325
(parking brake cranking)

50:16.359 --> 50:18.461
(speaking Italian)

50:25.301 --> 50:28.103
(mellow music)

51:14.215 --> 51:16.217
(speaking foreign language)

51:23.326 --> 51:31.232
<i>Lately, uh, with the mother
of my baby girl, DeeDee, uh,</i>

51:31.267 --> 51:34.869
<i>I've had some problems
because every time</i>

51:34.903 --> 51:39.240
<i>I try to extend myself to her,
do things for her,</i>

51:39.275 --> 51:41.109
<i>she really pushes me away.</i>

51:41.142 --> 51:43.312
<i>She's, like, got issues.</i>

51:43.346 --> 51:49.552
<i>She... she's younger than me,
she's, uh, 29.</i>

51:49.585 --> 51:52.921
<i>You'd think she would
appreciate my experience.</i>

51:52.954 --> 51:53.988
(laughter)

51:54.022 --> 51:55.957
But, you know, sometimes, she...

51:55.990 --> 51:58.527
she just says, "Oh, let me make
my own decision up.

51:58.561 --> 52:01.229
I don't know who I am
if I don't make a decision."

52:01.263 --> 52:03.031
And I'm telling you,
this goes down

52:03.064 --> 52:06.302
to just very simple things,
you know, like what food to eat

52:06.335 --> 52:09.438
or whether to take a taxi
or the subway,

52:09.472 --> 52:11.307
or these kinds of things,

52:11.340 --> 52:15.210
and it... it really robs me
of, um,

52:15.243 --> 52:18.381
feeling good
like I'm taking care of her.

52:18.414 --> 52:21.116
(bright music)

52:26.020 --> 52:29.991
<i>I do know, you know, she has
a strange relationship...</i>

52:30.024 --> 52:31.660
<i>well, a rough relationship
with her father</i>

52:31.694 --> 52:34.028
<i>because he was an alcoholic</i>

52:34.062 --> 52:36.231
<i>and a bad Russian drunk.</i>

52:36.265 --> 52:39.335
<i>Vodka, you know,
he was abusive with the mother.</i>

52:39.368 --> 52:41.370
<i>Eventually, she kicked her out</i>

52:41.404 --> 52:45.441
<i>and he left when she was
only four years old.</i>

52:45.474 --> 52:50.413
<i>And then, uh, things started
to change in the Eastern Bloc,</i>

52:50.446 --> 52:52.681
<i>and her mother and then
her sister went to Moscow</i>

52:52.715 --> 52:55.251
<i>and she got passed around
with family and...</i>

52:55.284 --> 52:56.652
<i>and other people.</i>

52:56.685 --> 52:58.521
<i>Um, that's where she lived.</i>

52:58.554 --> 53:00.623
<i>So she grew up
very independent.</i>

53:00.656 --> 53:02.691
<i>So she did learn
to be self-reliant,</i>

53:02.725 --> 53:05.428
<i>but at the same time,
she had these unresolved issues</i>

53:05.461 --> 53:08.531
<i>with her father because
she also romanticizes him.</i>

53:08.564 --> 53:10.633
<i>She still wants to talk to him,</i>

53:10.666 --> 53:12.268
but he won't talk to her.

53:12.301 --> 53:14.235
He still is around somewhere,

53:14.270 --> 53:16.472
he's still an alcoholic.

53:16.505 --> 53:18.407
You know.

53:18.441 --> 53:21.377
So that's a little hard to take.

53:21.410 --> 53:25.980
You know, I'm haunted
a little bit by the fact that...

53:26.014 --> 53:28.684
my... my DeeDee
is three years old,

53:28.717 --> 53:35.658
and when... when I wasn't sober,

53:35.691 --> 53:40.496
I had two adopted children,

53:40.529 --> 53:44.300
and I was not...

53:44.333 --> 53:47.570
I left when, uh...

53:47.603 --> 53:52.308
I basically left, I wasn't there
because I wasn't sober,

53:52.341 --> 53:54.477
when my youngest
was four years old,

53:54.510 --> 53:58.781
and I think she, you know,
it really destroyed her,

53:58.814 --> 54:01.650
and I don't want that
to happen again.

54:01.684 --> 54:05.688
I'm sober now, and, uh,

54:05.721 --> 54:08.657
I'm so afraid of it,
but I don't know how to do

54:08.691 --> 54:13.161
because I try to take care,
and every time I do, you know,

54:13.194 --> 54:19.301
it's like there's no recognition
that, um, that...

54:19.335 --> 54:23.405
Even like the idea
that the baby needs a father

54:23.439 --> 54:27.676
is like an oppressive
or, you know...

54:27.710 --> 54:31.680
She doesn't think
that's necessarily true,

54:31.714 --> 54:35.784
and for me, it's essential
because it breaks my heart.

54:35.818 --> 54:39.187
I remember the four-year-old,
right before I left,

54:39.220 --> 54:42.156
she said to me, uh,

54:42.190 --> 54:46.395
"Are you leaving
because I make too much noise?"

54:46.428 --> 54:48.430
And the truth is,
she was the quietest,

54:48.464 --> 54:50.432
sweetest girl in the world,

54:50.466 --> 54:52.735
so that...
that always stays with me,

54:52.768 --> 54:57.506
and I just don't want that
to happen again, and I'm...

54:57.540 --> 54:59.642
I'm happy about
a lot of things.

54:59.675 --> 55:02.678
I'm happy that I'm sober,
but, uh,

55:02.711 --> 55:05.548
this is something
that I'm dealing with right now.

55:05.581 --> 55:07.215
- Thanks, Tommy.
- Thanks, Tommy.

55:09.117 --> 55:10.753
Yeah, I'm Diedre, an addict.

55:10.786 --> 55:12.755
- Hi, Diedre.
- Hi, Diedre.

55:12.788 --> 55:17.259
Uh, related a lot
to what I just heard.

55:17.293 --> 55:20.262
I feel like being
in a partnership

55:20.296 --> 55:24.800
and parenting in a partnership
can be so challenging for me.

55:24.833 --> 55:28.537
Um, I mean, it says
in our literature,

55:28.571 --> 55:32.541
it is, like, impossible for us

55:32.575 --> 55:35.444
to form a true partnership
with another human being.

55:35.477 --> 55:38.581
I mean, that says it all.

55:38.614 --> 55:41.115
Um...

55:41.149 --> 55:42.885
Because, like, I've, you know...

55:42.918 --> 55:45.153
Like, we don't have
relationships,

55:45.186 --> 55:46.689
we take hostages, right?

55:46.722 --> 55:47.690
So like...

55:47.723 --> 55:49.223
(laughing)

55:49.258 --> 55:51.493
Like, we're either,
like, dominating

55:51.527 --> 55:53.295
or we're completely underneath.

55:53.329 --> 55:56.865
Like, there's not
the, just, the equality,

55:56.899 --> 55:58.901
you know, and I...

55:58.934 --> 56:01.235
I always... I always know

56:01.270 --> 56:04.440
my partner's inventory
better than he does.

56:04.473 --> 56:07.710
Like, I always know
exactly what's wrong with him,

56:07.743 --> 56:11.647
what he's gotta do, his past,
his psychology, everything,

56:11.680 --> 56:13.849
you know what I mean,
and the thing is is that

56:13.882 --> 56:16.385
this program teaches me to,

56:16.418 --> 56:18.420
like, stick to my side
of the street.

56:18.454 --> 56:21.790
I have to look
at what my part is,

56:21.824 --> 56:24.593
what I do, and, you know,

56:24.627 --> 56:26.895
as soon as I'm pointing
a finger,

56:26.929 --> 56:30.366
like, it's...
I've gotta look at myself.

56:30.399 --> 56:32.868
So, anyway, I'm super grateful.

56:32.901 --> 56:34.235
I pass.

56:34.269 --> 56:36.505
Thanks, Diedre.

56:36.538 --> 56:39.173
(crosstalk)

56:43.379 --> 56:44.880
All the best.

56:44.913 --> 56:46.448
Take it easy, guys.

56:46.482 --> 56:48.417
Okay, guys, I'm off,
I'm really hungry.

56:48.450 --> 56:50.452
I have to get something to eat,
so I'll see you later.

56:50.486 --> 56:52.354
All right, all the best.
Ciao. Take it easy.

56:52.388 --> 56:53.589
- Bye.
- All the best. Ciao.

56:53.622 --> 56:54.890
Ciao. I'm giving you two.

56:54.923 --> 56:56.759
Yeah, I should probably
get going too.

56:56.792 --> 56:58.226
Okay, yeah, all right.

56:58.260 --> 56:59.495
- Love you.
- Goodnight.

56:59.528 --> 57:00.929
- Okay, love you, sweetie.
- Bye.

57:00.963 --> 57:02.798
- Great to see you.
- Yeah, same.

57:02.831 --> 57:03.832
- We'll talk later.
- Okay.

57:03.866 --> 57:05.434
- Bye.
- Ciao.

57:06.602 --> 57:08.871
Hmm, all right, I'm...

57:08.904 --> 57:10.606
Yeah, I walk that way.

57:10.639 --> 57:11.774
Oh.

57:19.247 --> 57:20.549
So...

57:22.518 --> 57:24.453
Are you around for a while?

57:24.486 --> 57:25.921
Yeah, I'm here for the summer.

57:25.954 --> 57:27.556
You are,
you're not going anywhere?

57:27.589 --> 57:29.391
- No.
- Yeah?

57:29.425 --> 57:32.327
No, I usually like to travel
when it's not so crowded.

57:32.361 --> 57:33.996
- Smart idea.
- Yeah.

57:34.029 --> 57:37.266
I don't get this Italian thing
of everybody leaving at...

57:37.299 --> 57:40.569
Yeah, exactly, and being,
like, all packed on the beach.

57:40.602 --> 57:41.704
I get it, but...

57:41.737 --> 57:42.938
- I don't get it.
- ...what a drag.

57:42.971 --> 57:44.473
I mean, I get how it happens.

57:44.506 --> 57:46.442
Right, right, right, yeah, yeah.

57:46.475 --> 57:48.477
School holidays, whatever.

57:48.510 --> 57:52.648
No, I have the luxury
of traveling off-season,

57:52.681 --> 57:54.917
so I usually take advantage
of that.

57:54.950 --> 57:56.885
Do you usually go by yourself?

57:56.919 --> 57:58.520
Um, it depends, actually...

57:58.554 --> 58:01.523
- With friends?
- No, I usually go by myself.

58:01.557 --> 58:03.459
You were with that guy
for a little while.

58:03.492 --> 58:05.327
- Are you still with him?
- Mmm...

58:05.360 --> 58:06.462
No, no?

58:06.495 --> 58:07.529
(chuckling)

58:08.597 --> 58:10.332
Um... no.

58:10.365 --> 58:11.533
No, that's finished.

58:11.567 --> 58:12.935
How long ago was that?

58:12.968 --> 58:14.937
Well, it was on and off
for like six years,

58:14.970 --> 58:18.373
but finally finished like
about a year and a half ago.

58:18.407 --> 58:20.476
I'll... I'll walk you.

58:20.509 --> 58:21.710
Okay.

58:21.744 --> 58:23.345
- Okay?
- Yeah.

58:23.378 --> 58:24.546
Thanks.

58:24.580 --> 58:25.714
(soft music)

58:25.748 --> 58:27.316
How long ago?

58:27.349 --> 58:29.618
- About a year and a half ago.
- Oh, okay.

58:32.955 --> 58:36.024
And how has that been,
like, being alone again?

58:36.058 --> 58:37.392
Good?

58:37.426 --> 58:38.861
Hmm, yes.

58:38.894 --> 58:41.396
- Do you like being alone?
- Actually, yes.

58:41.430 --> 58:42.698
Yeah?

58:42.731 --> 58:45.834
At first it was, you know...

58:45.868 --> 58:49.037
Well, at first
I was just bummed out

58:49.071 --> 58:51.073
because we tried
on and off for so long,

58:51.106 --> 58:55.077
but now I'm pretty happily
single, you know.

58:55.110 --> 58:57.846
In fact, I was just talking
to a friend of mine

58:57.880 --> 59:00.382
about how much
I love sleeping alone.

59:00.415 --> 59:02.618
It's like heaven.

59:02.651 --> 59:05.487
- A whole bed to myself.
- Oh, God!

59:05.521 --> 59:08.056
Not me, I think I've
always been with someone.

59:08.090 --> 59:10.592
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah.

59:10.626 --> 59:13.796
But, I don't know, I never had
the opportunity to sleep alone,

59:13.829 --> 59:18.700
I think, so this is my...
my first big run of...

59:18.734 --> 59:20.636
- Enjoying yourself.
- ...hogging the bed.

59:20.669 --> 59:22.538
(laughing)

59:22.571 --> 59:25.741
You just need a big bed
so you have some choices.

59:25.774 --> 59:27.009
(laughing)

59:27.042 --> 59:28.610
You know.

59:28.644 --> 59:31.346
- Right?
- Uh, yeah.

59:31.380 --> 59:33.482
That's what I like.
I like a nice, big bed.

59:33.515 --> 59:35.684
We're gonna need a bigger bed,
it's like...

59:39.888 --> 59:41.857
Hmm.

59:41.890 --> 59:43.992
- Well...
- Okay, um...

59:44.026 --> 59:46.728
- This is me.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

59:46.762 --> 59:48.664
Okay, well,
have a good night, huh?

59:48.697 --> 59:50.632
Thank you. You too.

59:50.666 --> 59:52.868
Thanks for walking me home,
and, um,

59:52.901 --> 59:55.504
happy six years.

59:55.537 --> 59:56.805
- Thank you.
- That's awesome.

59:56.839 --> 59:58.440
- Thank you.
- Yeah, okay.

59:58.473 --> 01:00:00.075
Okay.

01:00:00.108 --> 01:00:03.645
- Make sure you get in.
- Thank you.

01:00:03.679 --> 01:00:04.847
(door opening)

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.682
- Okay, yeah, goodnight.
- Goodnight.

01:00:06.715 --> 01:00:08.951
- Sleep well.
- You too. Thanks.

01:00:11.086 --> 01:00:12.421
(door closes)

01:00:25.067 --> 01:00:26.935
(door opening)

01:00:32.441 --> 01:00:33.709
(door closes)

01:00:36.044 --> 01:00:38.981
(door locking)

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:46.755
(exhaling)

01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:50.525
(kicking)

01:00:53.528 --> 01:00:54.763
(clattering)

01:00:57.499 --> 01:00:59.434
(dishes clinking)

01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:16.685
(groans)

01:01:43.845 --> 01:01:45.647
(doorbell rings)

01:01:45.681 --> 01:01:46.982
Oh!

01:01:51.553 --> 01:01:53.121
Hey!

01:01:53.155 --> 01:01:54.656
(knocking)

01:01:54.690 --> 01:01:56.692
(door unlocking)

01:01:58.294 --> 01:01:59.262
Hey!

01:01:59.295 --> 01:02:00.629
(laughing)

01:02:00.662 --> 01:02:01.863
Hey!

01:02:01.897 --> 01:02:03.865
- How are you?
- Hey.

01:02:03.899 --> 01:02:07.035
Good? Yeah? Was it fun?

01:02:07.069 --> 01:02:09.738
Yeah, it's... it's fun.

01:02:09.771 --> 01:02:11.606
I missed you guys.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.041
(unintelligible)

01:02:13.075 --> 01:02:15.911
- Okay?
- Yes.

01:02:15.944 --> 01:02:17.646
(clattering)

01:02:17.679 --> 01:02:21.116
We had a great time.

01:02:21.149 --> 01:02:24.052
- Umbrella?
- Yeah, take the umbrella.

01:02:24.086 --> 01:02:27.689
Take the other shoe.
Okay, honey.

01:02:27.723 --> 01:02:29.124
Okay.

01:02:30.592 --> 01:02:32.194
But it was good?

01:02:32.227 --> 01:02:35.230
You know, it's always good,
you know.

01:02:35.264 --> 01:02:38.700
She has this big garden,
big things,

01:02:38.734 --> 01:02:43.138
and she plays with it,
and it's really nice.

01:02:43.171 --> 01:02:44.840
I missed you, huh?

01:02:44.873 --> 01:02:46.108
(water running)

01:02:46.141 --> 01:02:48.076
(laughing)

01:02:49.345 --> 01:02:50.812
Really?

01:02:50.846 --> 01:02:52.748
Yeah.

01:02:52.781 --> 01:02:56.184
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah!

01:02:56.218 --> 01:02:58.053
Well, I don't believe it.

01:02:58.086 --> 01:02:59.688
- You don't?
- No.

01:02:59.721 --> 01:03:02.190
- Okay.
- You look too good to miss me.

01:03:02.224 --> 01:03:04.159
(laughing)

01:03:04.192 --> 01:03:05.627
Okay?

01:03:06.928 --> 01:03:09.031
So, what's going on here?

01:03:09.064 --> 01:03:10.599
I've just been working.

01:03:10.632 --> 01:03:12.834
I've just been working,
you know?

01:03:12.868 --> 01:03:14.770
I'm trying to do
this crazy thing

01:03:14.803 --> 01:03:17.773
about these, um,
scenes with the bear.

01:03:17.806 --> 01:03:19.941
And?

01:03:19.975 --> 01:03:22.311
I don't know, 'cause you
don't want it to be, like,

01:03:22.345 --> 01:03:24.246
you know, like a big
special effects thing,

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:27.749
but I want the scariness
of the bear in there, so...

01:03:27.783 --> 01:03:30.118
(gentle music)

01:03:31.987 --> 01:03:33.722
<i>Clint puts down bar rag</i>

01:03:33.755 --> 01:03:36.292
<i>and comes around bar
to get a closer look.</i>

01:03:36.325 --> 01:03:39.061
<i>Numbers stop,
and again, it's a loss.</i>

01:03:39.094 --> 01:03:41.330
<i>Woodsman turns to Clint,
only this time,</i>

01:03:41.364 --> 01:03:45.133
<i>it is the head of a bear
in the clothes of the woodsman.</i>

01:03:45.167 --> 01:03:47.336
<i>Clint,
with no Mitchell in sight,</i>

01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:51.239
<i>is in bloody, violent, and
extended fight for his life.</i>

01:03:51.274 --> 01:03:52.707
(bear growling)

01:03:52.741 --> 01:03:54.910
<i>Dogs outside going wild.</i>

01:03:54.943 --> 01:03:56.912
(dogs barking)

01:03:56.945 --> 01:03:58.880
(shouting)

01:04:02.285 --> 01:04:03.819
(shouting)

01:04:21.837 --> 01:04:24.172
(growling, screaming)

01:04:30.245 --> 01:04:32.747
(smacking)

01:04:39.087 --> 01:04:41.022
(shouting)

01:04:46.228 --> 01:04:48.063
(grumbling)

01:04:49.865 --> 01:04:51.700
(speaking foreign language)

01:05:01.243 --> 01:05:03.778
- You're eating?
- Yes.

01:05:03.812 --> 01:05:06.047
Why didn't you call me?

01:05:06.081 --> 01:05:08.950
I thought...
I thought you already ate.

01:05:08.984 --> 01:05:10.152
No.

01:05:10.185 --> 01:05:11.820
- No?
- No.

01:05:11.853 --> 01:05:13.922
- Why?
- Why didn't you call me?

01:05:13.955 --> 01:05:16.224
But why you didn't eat yet?

01:05:16.259 --> 01:05:19.895
You know, it's fucking...
it's thoughtless.

01:05:19.928 --> 01:05:22.398
Come on, I waited...
you know, I...

01:05:22.431 --> 01:05:25.033
I missed...
I sat around all yesterday,

01:05:25.066 --> 01:05:27.403
and I made my own dinner,
then you make food,

01:05:27.436 --> 01:05:29.070
you don't even call me.

01:05:29.104 --> 01:05:30.872
I've been waiting to have lunch.

01:05:30.906 --> 01:05:32.874
Why you...
why you gotta wait for me?

01:05:32.908 --> 01:05:34.277
Why you gotta wait for me?

01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:36.111
You can cook, you are an adult.

01:05:36.144 --> 01:05:38.813
I know, okay, okay,
I can cook and I will cook.

01:05:38.847 --> 01:05:40.283
I'll cook my own stuff.

01:05:40.316 --> 01:05:44.219
Jesus Christ, do you know,
I waited for you.

01:05:44.253 --> 01:05:47.889
- You know, I wait for you...
- No, no, come on...

01:05:47.923 --> 01:05:50.992
No, it just bugs me
because it's inconsiderate.

01:05:51.026 --> 01:05:53.828
I like to eat
with you and the baby.

01:05:53.862 --> 01:05:55.096
Oh, come on.

01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:58.099
What do you mean,
"Oh, come on"?

01:05:58.133 --> 01:05:59.302
What do you mean?

01:05:59.335 --> 01:06:00.369
(Nikki laughing)

01:06:00.403 --> 01:06:01.903
Yeah, laugh, you know,

01:06:01.937 --> 01:06:03.838
you laugh when you know
you're full of shit.

01:06:03.872 --> 01:06:06.509
- That's what happens.
- Can I have at least the freedom

01:06:06.542 --> 01:06:10.346
to eat when I want
and with who I want

01:06:10.379 --> 01:06:13.316
and without busting my balls
and blah-blah-blah?

01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:16.319
Okay, I don't mean
to bust your balls, believe me.

01:06:16.352 --> 01:06:19.788
I just try to take care, it's
all a little silly, you know?

01:06:19.821 --> 01:06:22.791
You talk a lot of shit,
you know, you talk a lot of...

01:06:22.824 --> 01:06:23.992
(laughing)

01:06:24.025 --> 01:06:26.429
...hippie shit.

01:06:26.462 --> 01:06:29.030
- Oh my God.
- Why don't you make it for me?

01:06:29.064 --> 01:06:31.199
I mean, I'm trying to work.

01:06:31.233 --> 01:06:32.834
- Really?
- I make it for you.

01:06:32.867 --> 01:06:35.136
It's just... it's just
common consideration.

01:06:35.170 --> 01:06:36.938
Really, I thought
you already had.

01:06:36.972 --> 01:06:40.309
Being a family,
being a couple, you know,

01:06:40.343 --> 01:06:42.378
loving someone
is being present.

01:06:42.411 --> 01:06:44.212
It's about...
it's about attention,

01:06:44.246 --> 01:06:48.016
it's about... it's about,
you know, taking care.

01:06:48.049 --> 01:06:50.118
I'm trying to do my thing.

01:06:50.151 --> 01:06:51.387
(Tommaso laughing)

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:53.154
- And...
- What is your thing?

01:06:53.188 --> 01:06:55.156
- My thing?
- Yeah, what is your thing?

01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:56.559
(laughing)

01:06:56.592 --> 01:06:58.561
"It's your thing,
do what you wanna do,

01:06:58.594 --> 01:07:01.863
I can't tell you
who to sock it to."

01:07:01.896 --> 01:07:05.934
Oh, come on.
To do what I want, when I want,

01:07:05.967 --> 01:07:10.539
everything that I really want,
without explaining to somebody...

01:07:10.573 --> 01:07:13.342
So I have two children now?

01:07:13.376 --> 01:07:15.243
(laughing)

01:07:25.086 --> 01:07:27.188
(laughing)

01:07:27.222 --> 01:07:29.858
(bell ringing)

01:07:32.295 --> 01:07:34.963
(grunting)

01:07:34.996 --> 01:07:37.832
(ethereal music)

01:08:07.128 --> 01:08:10.065
(growling)

01:08:15.538 --> 01:08:18.374
(making low, pulsing sounds)

01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:35.390
(exhaling)

01:08:37.926 --> 01:08:39.462
Start your story.

01:08:43.769 --> 01:08:45.965
Once I met a boy.

01:08:47.863 --> 01:08:49.712
I liked his eyes.

01:08:52.886 --> 01:08:55.792
His eyes and his mouth.

01:08:58.091 --> 01:09:01.554
I liked his mouth, it was big.

01:09:02.345 --> 01:09:03.465
Beautiful.

01:09:05.911 --> 01:09:09.960
I remember he started
hugging and kissing me.

01:09:12.232 --> 01:09:13.854
I fell in love immediately.

01:09:20.453 --> 01:09:24.667
I liked his eyes, his smell...

01:10:28.404 --> 01:10:30.406
(belligerent shouting)

01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:43.619
(water running)

01:10:50.225 --> 01:10:52.193
(speaking foreign language)

01:10:52.227 --> 01:10:54.563
Okay? Don't worry.

01:10:54.597 --> 01:10:56.565
(shouting continues outside)

01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:58.601
Mama?

01:10:58.634 --> 01:11:01.437
(speaking foreign language)

01:11:03.772 --> 01:11:05.274
Mama, Mama?

01:11:05.307 --> 01:11:07.510
You know what,
I'm gonna go down there.

01:11:07.543 --> 01:11:10.479
- Okay?
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:11:10.513 --> 01:11:13.248
Everything gonna be okay.

01:11:15.484 --> 01:11:17.419
(shouting continues)

01:11:25.584 --> 01:11:29.674
Shut up!
You're making us crazy.

01:11:33.533 --> 01:11:36.446
Somebody call the police!

01:11:36.772 --> 01:11:38.574
(shouting continues)

01:11:39.744 --> 01:11:42.665
If you don't stop,
I'll come and punch you.

01:11:48.182 --> 01:11:50.452
You know,
he's freaking out the baby.

01:11:50.486 --> 01:11:52.588
I know, I know, I know, I know.

01:11:52.621 --> 01:11:54.590
Just... yeah, but just be careful.

01:11:54.623 --> 01:11:56.358
- Listen, be careful.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

01:11:56.392 --> 01:11:58.527
You know, with these guys,
you never know.

01:12:05.868 --> 01:12:08.169
(breathing heavily)

01:12:20.416 --> 01:12:22.351
(shouting continues)

01:12:26.722 --> 01:12:27.723
Yo!

01:12:30.744 --> 01:12:31.966
Stop it!

01:12:35.297 --> 01:12:37.633
(shouting obscenities)

01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:40.762
You are scaring my baby!

01:12:42.284 --> 01:12:44.403
Stop it! Shut up!

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:47.476
- ...motherfucker.
- Get outta here!

01:12:47.509 --> 01:12:50.779
- You speak English?
- I don't speak English but I...

01:12:50.813 --> 01:12:52.381
(drunken mumbling)

01:12:52.414 --> 01:12:54.783
Get the fuck outta here,
get the fuck outta here.

01:12:54.817 --> 01:12:56.619
Get outta here!

01:12:56.652 --> 01:12:57.686
(kicking)

01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:59.288
Fucking bloody...

01:12:59.321 --> 01:13:03.224
Get your shit outta here,
come on, go!

01:13:03.258 --> 01:13:04.793
(drunken mumbling)

01:13:04.827 --> 01:13:06.562
- ...I'll destroy you.
- Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

01:13:06.595 --> 01:13:09.732
Yeah, you're gonna do it?
Get outta here, get outta here.

01:13:09.765 --> 01:13:11.433
Just get out.

01:13:11.467 --> 01:13:13.268
Beat it, beat it.

01:13:13.302 --> 01:13:15.437
Come on, be on your way.

01:13:15.471 --> 01:13:18.307
Take your food with you. Go.

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:20.174
Oh, my baby, she can't sleep,

01:13:20.208 --> 01:13:21.910
you're scaring the shit
out of her.

01:13:21.944 --> 01:13:23.879
Where is it?

01:13:23.912 --> 01:13:25.714
Your baby is sleeping?

01:13:25.748 --> 01:13:27.650
Upstairs, upstairs.

01:13:27.683 --> 01:13:29.618
So I'm making bothering
with you?

01:13:29.652 --> 01:13:31.453
You're bothering me.

01:13:31.487 --> 01:13:34.256
- It's true?
- Yeah, it's true, it's true.

01:13:34.289 --> 01:13:35.724
Keeping...

01:13:35.758 --> 01:13:37.326
- Yeah.
- No anything.

01:13:37.359 --> 01:13:38.427
Okay.

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.695
(speaking Italian)

01:13:39.728 --> 01:13:41.563
We maybe compromises.

01:13:41.597 --> 01:13:45.401
Okay, you can sit down,
but no more, okay?

01:13:45.434 --> 01:13:46.702
Yeah.

01:13:46.735 --> 01:13:48.971
I don't want to bother you.

01:13:49.004 --> 01:13:50.606
Good.

01:13:50.639 --> 01:13:53.241
You're a nice person,
give me some coins?

01:13:53.275 --> 01:13:54.543
(mumbling)

01:13:54.576 --> 01:13:56.478
Yeah, I can give you some coins.

01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:00.816
Where you come from?

01:14:00.849 --> 01:14:02.518
The States.

01:14:02.551 --> 01:14:04.787
Which part of States?

01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:06.255
New York.

01:14:06.288 --> 01:14:07.923
- New York.
- How about you?

01:14:07.956 --> 01:14:12.828
All of my friends live
in here, here, just near here.

01:14:12.861 --> 01:14:14.363
They came from New York.

01:14:14.396 --> 01:14:16.398
Where are you from?

01:14:16.432 --> 01:14:18.467
- Pakistan.
- Pakistan?

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:19.768
You know where it is?

01:14:19.802 --> 01:14:21.403
I've heard of it.

01:14:21.437 --> 01:14:23.505
(unintelligible)

01:14:23.539 --> 01:14:24.540
(laughing)

01:14:24.573 --> 01:14:26.408
They are all bullshit.

01:14:26.442 --> 01:14:27.910
(unintelligible)

01:14:27.943 --> 01:14:29.578
I know, I know, I know.

01:14:29.611 --> 01:14:32.347
(unintelligible)

01:14:37.319 --> 01:14:39.722
(laughing)

01:14:39.755 --> 01:14:41.724
Okay, okay, okay.

01:14:43.592 --> 01:14:45.260
Fuckin' hell.

01:14:50.432 --> 01:14:53.769
That's... that stuff's poison,
you know that.

01:14:55.337 --> 01:14:56.972
- Enjoy yourself.
- Okay.

01:14:57.005 --> 01:14:59.608
- Have a good night.
- Yes, to you.

01:15:00.576 --> 01:15:02.344
See you the next time.

01:15:02.377 --> 01:15:04.245
Okay, good luck.

01:15:06.048 --> 01:15:07.349
Okay.

01:15:11.553 --> 01:15:12.755
Okay.

01:15:15.758 --> 01:15:16.992
Goodnight.

01:15:17.025 --> 01:15:18.961
(unintelligible)

01:15:20.095 --> 01:15:21.597
Just go.

01:15:21.630 --> 01:15:23.298
You're good.

01:15:36.912 --> 01:15:38.547
(muttering)

01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:44.553
(bells chiming)

01:15:44.586 --> 01:15:46.588
(mellow music)

01:16:18.987 --> 01:16:21.590
(mumbling mantra)

01:16:37.439 --> 01:16:38.740
(doorbell ringing)

01:16:46.648 --> 01:16:47.950
(door opening)

01:16:55.958 --> 01:16:57.893
(laughing)

01:17:12.441 --> 01:17:14.877
(dark music)

01:17:35.964 --> 01:17:38.433
(bells chiming)

01:17:50.045 --> 01:17:51.647
(child yelling)

01:18:06.862 --> 01:18:08.196
DeeDee!

01:18:09.231 --> 01:18:11.166
(insects chirring)

01:18:14.970 --> 01:18:16.204
(shouting)

01:18:16.238 --> 01:18:18.173
(tires screeching, car slams)

01:18:40.862 --> 01:18:43.966
(upbeat music playing)

01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:58.914
(cheering)

01:19:09.691 --> 01:19:11.727
(breathing heavily)

01:19:22.258 --> 01:19:26.580
Anybody have a story?
Raise your hand if you do.

01:19:28.810 --> 01:19:30.145
Okay.

01:19:30.854 --> 01:19:34.951
I left home when I was 19

01:19:35.688 --> 01:19:39.640
and I moved abroad.

01:19:40.682 --> 01:19:43.650
- Where?
- Dubai, in the Emirates.

01:19:44.338 --> 01:19:47.374
Good, do it again.

01:19:48.146 --> 01:19:50.893
Do the same movements,

01:19:50.981 --> 01:19:54.435
but this time tell the whole story.

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:57.357
Now I'm going, I don't care where,

01:19:57.403 --> 01:20:02.409
the important thing is that
I go far from my family.

01:20:03.422 --> 01:20:07.170
I will choose the first place
that wants me

01:20:07.210 --> 01:20:08.194
and I'll go there.

01:20:09.595 --> 01:20:12.373
I'm here, I'm here in Dubai.

01:20:15.153 --> 01:20:18.965
I really wanted to come here
because I thought

01:20:20.028 --> 01:20:23.621
I could find something here
that I couldn't find there.

01:20:24.045 --> 01:20:26.029
But here there's nothing at all.

01:20:27.235 --> 01:20:29.071
<i>So where is he now?</i>

01:20:30.906 --> 01:20:33.108
I don't know.

01:20:33.141 --> 01:20:36.078
You don't...
but he just wrote you, right?

01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:40.982
He sent you an email.

01:20:41.016 --> 01:20:45.787
Yeah, he sent me some emails
during those three years...

01:20:45.821 --> 01:20:49.925
Only... ahh, see, I thought
he just sent you recently.

01:20:49.958 --> 01:20:52.094
- No.
- No? Oh.

01:20:52.127 --> 01:20:57.132
No, like, a few emails
in three years...

01:20:57.165 --> 01:21:00.735
- Oh, that's terrible.
- ...are not enough for a father.

01:21:03.105 --> 01:21:06.241
So you're, you know,
so you basically cut him off,

01:21:06.275 --> 01:21:07.709
you're angry because he...

01:21:07.742 --> 01:21:10.112
- Of course I am.
- Yeah.

01:21:10.145 --> 01:21:13.282
He... he was everything for me.

01:21:13.316 --> 01:21:16.017
So he disappointed you.

01:21:16.051 --> 01:21:18.920
He...

01:21:18.954 --> 01:21:24.293
He was teaching me
to believe in some values.

01:21:24.327 --> 01:21:26.061
Mm-hmm.

01:21:26.094 --> 01:21:30.132
And he showed me
that those values

01:21:30.165 --> 01:21:31.400
don't exist.

01:21:31.434 --> 01:21:34.669
- Okay.
- He destroyed my world.

01:21:34.703 --> 01:21:39.908
He destroyed my hope,
everything.

01:21:39.941 --> 01:21:41.143
Right.

01:21:41.176 --> 01:21:42.144
So...

01:21:44.079 --> 01:21:47.749
How can it be possible,
like, for a father?

01:21:49.851 --> 01:21:51.320
I don't know.

01:21:51.354 --> 01:21:54.089
I mean, we are...

01:21:54.122 --> 01:21:55.857
He made me.

01:21:57.493 --> 01:22:00.429
He's supposed to love me,
to stay with me,

01:22:00.463 --> 01:22:03.698
to take care of me,
but he doesn't.

01:22:03.732 --> 01:22:07.035
He's completely focused
on other stupid stuff.

01:22:07.068 --> 01:22:08.770
Right.

01:22:10.972 --> 01:22:13.942
I don't...
I don't know what to say.

01:22:13.975 --> 01:22:16.379
- Anyway...
- I mean... yeah.

01:22:16.412 --> 01:22:18.347
Let's speak
about something more.

01:22:18.381 --> 01:22:20.115
Okay, something else.

01:22:20.148 --> 01:22:22.451
What about your baby?

01:22:22.485 --> 01:22:25.854
She's good, I mean, you know,
every day is a little miracle.

01:22:25.887 --> 01:22:30.091
She learns lots of stuff,
she's talking a lot more.

01:22:30.125 --> 01:22:33.028
Um, you know,
I love taking her to the park.

01:22:33.061 --> 01:22:37.165
I've got some stuff
with her mother, but, um,

01:22:37.199 --> 01:22:38.334
you know about that.

01:22:40.202 --> 01:22:43.306
So, it's hard, you know?

01:22:43.339 --> 01:22:46.908
But I'm dealing with it,
and, um, you know,

01:22:46.942 --> 01:22:49.512
making work and...

01:22:49.545 --> 01:22:51.380
I get to talk to you.

01:22:51.414 --> 01:22:53.782
(laughing)

01:22:53.815 --> 01:22:55.251
Class was good, huh?

01:22:55.284 --> 01:22:58.019
Yeah, today was amazing.

01:22:58.053 --> 01:23:02.090
Yeah, I love having you
in class.

01:23:02.123 --> 01:23:03.758
- Thanks.
- No, it's nice,

01:23:03.792 --> 01:23:06.161
and I'm always happy to see you.

01:23:07.530 --> 01:23:10.999
Okay, so, maybe I should go.

01:23:11.032 --> 01:23:13.868
Yeah, what are you up to?

01:23:13.902 --> 01:23:15.837
I don't know.

01:23:15.870 --> 01:23:17.406
You gotta go?

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:19.040
- Maybe, yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

01:23:19.074 --> 01:23:21.243
Okay, all right, ciao.

01:23:39.828 --> 01:23:41.196
(kissing)

01:24:03.952 --> 01:24:05.454
Okay, I gotta go.

01:24:06.322 --> 01:24:07.822
Okay.

01:24:09.592 --> 01:24:11.260
(door opening)

01:24:13.094 --> 01:24:14.162
(door closes)

01:24:21.537 --> 01:24:23.439
(engine starting)

01:24:23.472 --> 01:24:25.907
(soft music)

01:25:01.277 --> 01:25:04.212
(train hissing)

01:25:06.482 --> 01:25:08.417
(train squealing)

01:25:31.039 --> 01:25:33.975
(train whirring)

01:25:52.628 --> 01:25:54.563
(doors hissing)

01:26:28.196 --> 01:26:30.332
<i>When you touch
the fundamental nature</i>

01:26:30.366 --> 01:26:33.736
<i>of the ultimate reality
of any phenomenon whatsoever,</i>

01:26:33.769 --> 01:26:35.638
<i>there is pleasure.</i>

01:26:35.671 --> 01:26:38.307
<i>Everything that exists
is capable</i>

01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:41.577
<i>of eliciting pleasure
in your mind,</i>

01:26:41.610 --> 01:26:43.211
<i>but you are narrow.</i>

01:26:43.244 --> 01:26:45.246
<i>Your mind has
neurotic obsessions</i>

01:26:45.281 --> 01:26:49.685
<i>such as, "I only like things
that are purple."</i>

01:26:49.718 --> 01:26:53.589
<i>For you, only purple things
are beautiful.</i>

01:26:53.622 --> 01:26:56.024
<i>This sort of neurotic,
dualistic,</i>

01:26:56.057 --> 01:26:59.562
<i>unrealistic way of thinking
only gets you into trouble,</i>

01:26:59.595 --> 01:27:02.465
<i>but we do it all the time,
don't we?</i>

01:27:25.119 --> 01:27:26.789
(insects chirring)

01:27:26.822 --> 01:27:28.491
Hey!

01:27:33.329 --> 01:27:35.163
What's happening?

01:27:35.196 --> 01:27:37.232
How come you came here?

01:27:37.266 --> 01:27:39.268
What's with this surprise?

01:27:39.301 --> 01:27:40.603
What is this surprise?

01:27:40.636 --> 01:27:42.136
(speaking Italian)

01:27:46.275 --> 01:27:47.543
Okay, so...

01:27:47.576 --> 01:27:49.745
(speaking Italian)

01:27:51.514 --> 01:27:53.248
(laughing)

01:27:54.483 --> 01:27:55.784
(blows raspberry)

01:27:56.552 --> 01:27:58.254
(laughing)

01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:03.325
Hey!

01:28:06.829 --> 01:28:08.129
Ciao!

01:28:08.162 --> 01:28:09.565
(laughing)

01:28:09.598 --> 01:28:10.833
Hey, Lisa.

01:28:10.866 --> 01:28:12.066
Oh!

01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:13.302
(laughing)

01:28:13.335 --> 01:28:14.537
Hey!

01:28:15.504 --> 01:28:17.171
Oh!

01:28:17.205 --> 01:28:19.107
(shouting)

01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:20.509
(laughing)

01:28:22.176 --> 01:28:24.613
They're having fun,
they're playing.

01:28:24.647 --> 01:28:28.584
I've been all over the park
running after them.

01:28:36.525 --> 01:28:39.261
(bell chiming)

01:28:45.601 --> 01:28:48.437
<i>My name's Danny,
and I'm an alcoholic.</i>

01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:50.104
- <i>Hi, Danny.</i>
- <i>Hi, Danny.</i>

01:28:50.138 --> 01:28:52.408
<i>I've enjoyed the meeting,
you know,</i>

01:28:52.441 --> 01:28:55.477
<i>and I'm listening
to the stories around the room</i>

01:28:55.511 --> 01:28:58.647
<i>and just thinking about,
you know,</i>

01:28:58.681 --> 01:29:02.585
<i>often when I come here,
I'm afraid, you know.</i>

01:29:02.618 --> 01:29:04.620
<i>The thing that's
in my mind most</i>

01:29:04.653 --> 01:29:06.255
<i>is feeling sorry for myself</i>

01:29:06.288 --> 01:29:08.490
<i>because everybody else
is going to the pub,</i>

01:29:08.524 --> 01:29:12.695
<i>and I have to fucking come here
and listen to people talking</i>

01:29:12.728 --> 01:29:15.631
<i>and, you know,</i>

01:29:15.664 --> 01:29:17.633
and I think about
the way it was,

01:29:17.666 --> 01:29:19.768
like, going to the pub
with a pint in the hand,

01:29:19.802 --> 01:29:22.438
cracking the jokes,
and all the rest of it.

01:29:22.471 --> 01:29:25.341
So I come here and I'm feeling
sorry for myself,

01:29:25.374 --> 01:29:28.344
but I'm quickly reminded
of, you know,

01:29:28.377 --> 01:29:32.414
how good it is to be sober
and, you know,

01:29:32.448 --> 01:29:34.717
I'm grateful because this week,
as you all know,

01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:38.787
Noemi has been going through,
you know, she has cancer,

01:29:38.821 --> 01:29:41.757
and, um,
she did treatment already

01:29:41.790 --> 01:29:44.293
and things have been going
really well,

01:29:44.326 --> 01:29:49.230
but, um, you know, we're going
for a routine test this week,

01:29:49.264 --> 01:29:52.568
and unfortunately,
the fucking thing's come back,

01:29:52.601 --> 01:29:56.338
you know, and it's not
life-threatening, you know,

01:29:56.372 --> 01:29:59.942
by no means are we looking
at death or anything like that,

01:29:59.975 --> 01:30:04.446
but when I come here
and I'm feeling sorry for myself

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:07.716
because I have to sit here
and listen to people,

01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:09.585
and then I think
about the reality

01:30:09.618 --> 01:30:13.221
that, you know,
my future wife is facing,

01:30:13.255 --> 01:30:17.559
it brings in the sharp focus,
the, you know,

01:30:17.593 --> 01:30:19.628
the selfish,
self-centered nature

01:30:19.662 --> 01:30:21.764
of what it is
that I suffer from,

01:30:21.797 --> 01:30:29.338
and it reminds me of how lucky
I am to be here, you know.

01:30:29.371 --> 01:30:30.839
That's all I've got
for this evening.

01:30:30.873 --> 01:30:31.974
Thanks very much.

01:30:32.007 --> 01:30:34.910
- Thanks, Danny.
- Thanks, Danny.

01:30:34.943 --> 01:30:36.945
<i>My name is Souten,
I'm an alcoholic.</i>

01:30:36.979 --> 01:30:38.514
- <i>Hi, Souten.</i>
- <i>Hi, Souten.</i>

01:30:38.547 --> 01:30:40.516
<i>When I was about 19 years old,</i>

01:30:40.549 --> 01:30:44.319
I was already 13 years drinking
and doing drugs.

01:30:44.353 --> 01:30:48.290
I rock bottom big time.

01:30:48.323 --> 01:30:50.893
I came in AA,
somebody helped me,

01:30:50.926 --> 01:30:53.796
and I stayed in the program
for eight years,

01:30:53.829 --> 01:30:58.734
and then it stopped,
and I picked up one drink,

01:30:58.767 --> 01:31:02.705
and I was fucked again
for another 18 years.

01:31:02.738 --> 01:31:04.840
Four years ago,
I rock bottom

01:31:04.873 --> 01:31:07.643
a little different than
the first time I rock bottom.

01:31:07.676 --> 01:31:09.445
I was in my house,

01:31:09.478 --> 01:31:12.581
and there were all people
I don't know in my house.

01:31:12.614 --> 01:31:16.952
Everywhere were bottles
with booze on the floors,

01:31:16.985 --> 01:31:19.755
and cocaine on the table,

01:31:19.788 --> 01:31:23.492
and women in my bed
who I don't know.

01:31:23.525 --> 01:31:25.661
And the worst thing is
that my wife,

01:31:25.694 --> 01:31:31.266
she was in the airplane
coming from Amsterdam back home,

01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:33.936
and I kick everybody
out of my house,

01:31:33.969 --> 01:31:37.473
I clean my house,
and when I put the last bottle

01:31:37.506 --> 01:31:40.576
in the busta nero,
in the trash bag,

01:31:40.609 --> 01:31:45.280
the taxi came up with my wife,
and I run to the bathroom,

01:31:45.314 --> 01:31:48.817
and I had this mirror moment,
I looked in the mirror

01:31:48.851 --> 01:31:54.723
after 18 years and I saw myself
totally white with the red eyes.

01:31:54.757 --> 01:31:56.792
And I thought,
"Fuck, man, that's not you,

01:31:56.825 --> 01:31:59.895
that's the devil,"
and there it hit me,

01:31:59.928 --> 01:32:03.465
the little... something
told me in my ears,

01:32:03.499 --> 01:32:07.536
"You have to do something
about your life, man."

01:32:07.569 --> 01:32:09.304
And I did.

01:32:09.338 --> 01:32:12.441
<i>So I did a year full,
every day a meeting.</i>

01:32:12.474 --> 01:32:16.879
<i>That was my first sober year,
and it was a miracle.</i>

01:32:16.912 --> 01:32:18.947
<i>And then miracles
started happening.</i>

01:32:18.981 --> 01:32:20.382
- Hey!
- Can you give me a lift?

01:32:20.415 --> 01:32:21.717
Yeah, come on.

01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:22.951
All right, I'll see ya
later on then.

01:32:22.985 --> 01:32:25.420
Good luck, all the best,
take it easy.

01:32:25.454 --> 01:32:30.425
<i>I just want to be free,
free from all the bullshit.</i>

01:32:30.459 --> 01:32:33.862
(mellow music)

01:32:33.896 --> 01:32:35.564
I must... I must be careful.

01:32:35.597 --> 01:32:38.100
Yeah, okay.
No, I'll walk you down.

01:32:38.133 --> 01:32:40.402
Oh, no, I'm coming with you.

01:32:40.435 --> 01:32:42.437
You're coming...
Oh, you're coming.

01:32:42.471 --> 01:32:44.506
Watch your step.

01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:45.874
(car starting)

01:32:45.908 --> 01:32:47.810
(groans)

01:32:47.843 --> 01:32:49.411
Okay.

01:32:57.719 --> 01:33:01.890
<i>It's just, uh, becoming more
and more a problem, you know,</i>

01:33:01.924 --> 01:33:06.061
<i>and I know it, uh,
has to do with the baby</i>

01:33:06.094 --> 01:33:08.530
<i>sleeping with us,
but I mean, uh...</i>

01:33:08.564 --> 01:33:10.465
<i>But the baby has its own bed,
doesn't it?</i>

01:33:10.499 --> 01:33:11.600
<i>No, no.</i>

01:33:11.633 --> 01:33:13.669
No, she fucking sleeps with us.

01:33:13.702 --> 01:33:15.404
So she's using the bed?

01:33:15.437 --> 01:33:17.039
Well, I mean, you know,

01:33:17.072 --> 01:33:20.642
ever since... ever since that baby
was born, everything changed.

01:33:20.676 --> 01:33:24.780
You know, I don't know,
we just don't, uh...

01:33:24.813 --> 01:33:28.150
Yeah, it changed like overnight.

01:33:28.183 --> 01:33:31.453
What I think is happening here,
I think,

01:33:31.486 --> 01:33:37.426
is that she is living out
a childhood experience.

01:33:37.459 --> 01:33:41.029
The scenes which are occurring
now between you and her,

01:33:41.063 --> 01:33:43.599
I would think that
they probably reflect

01:33:43.632 --> 01:33:46.668
what was happening in the house
when she was a child,

01:33:46.702 --> 01:33:48.704
and she's provoking that.

01:33:48.737 --> 01:33:54.409
She has created this white...
white knight in shining armor

01:33:54.443 --> 01:33:57.679
that she idolizes,
but in a sense,

01:33:57.713 --> 01:34:00.015
<i>you can't... you should not
take away that figure</i>

01:34:00.048 --> 01:34:01.917
<i>because that figure,
for the moment,</i>

01:34:01.950 --> 01:34:03.652
<i>is holding her together.</i>

01:34:07.589 --> 01:34:10.959
<i>The big problem is, I have
such fucking rage about this</i>

01:34:10.993 --> 01:34:13.729
<i>'cause I know I have
no place to, uh...</i>

01:34:13.762 --> 01:34:15.163
<i>To discharge it.</i>

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.102
<i>But that's the number one issue
at the moment.</i>

01:34:20.135 --> 01:34:22.671
<i>Why does that tie up
to the anger?</i>

01:34:22.704 --> 01:34:27.175
<i>Because the anger occupies
so much space in your life.</i>

01:34:27.209 --> 01:34:30.779
<i>There's very little energy left
for anything else,</i>

01:34:30.812 --> 01:34:34.650
<i>so if you create areas
of interest</i>

01:34:34.683 --> 01:34:36.585
for you,
like empathy for people,

01:34:36.618 --> 01:34:38.153
you're involved
in their lives.

01:34:38.186 --> 01:34:41.823
Energy flows there, so there is
less energy for the anger.

01:34:41.857 --> 01:34:44.026
Look, we are like...
when we come into AA,

01:34:44.059 --> 01:34:46.929
we're like lost souls,
lost fucking souls.

01:34:46.962 --> 01:34:49.031
Your soul is either
hanging off the fucking tree

01:34:49.064 --> 01:34:52.134
or it's over there,
and you have to get it back,

01:34:52.167 --> 01:34:56.972
and by becoming human,
but joining with the other gods,

01:34:57.005 --> 01:35:01.810
uh, slowly it got accommodated
sort of in its own fucking time.

01:35:01.843 --> 01:35:03.211
(laughing)

01:35:03.245 --> 01:35:05.213
And you have...
you become your own self,

01:35:05.247 --> 01:35:08.817
and you give yourself
your dignity, not she.

01:35:08.850 --> 01:35:12.955
That's... then the codependency
ends there at that stage,

01:35:12.988 --> 01:35:13.989
you understand?

01:35:17.793 --> 01:35:19.828
(wind whistling)

01:35:22.898 --> 01:35:25.000
<i>Interior: cafe, nightfall.</i>

01:35:25.033 --> 01:35:27.836
<i>The two enter cafe
and make their way to the bar.</i>

01:35:27.869 --> 01:35:31.106
<i>Clint moves behind bar
and prepares them warm drinks,</i>

01:35:31.139 --> 01:35:33.008
<i>knowing already what they want.</i>

01:35:33.041 --> 01:35:34.977
<i>They speak to each other
in Russian,</i>

01:35:35.010 --> 01:35:36.878
<i>and whether Clint knows
the language,</i>

01:35:36.912 --> 01:35:38.914
<i>it is also hard to tell.</i>

01:35:38.947 --> 01:35:40.983
<i>After encouragement
from the mother,</i>

01:35:41.016 --> 01:35:43.051
<i>the girl stands up
and opens her clothes</i>

01:35:43.085 --> 01:35:44.987
<i>to reveal she is pregnant.</i>

01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:46.822
<i>Clint's eyes come alive.</i>

01:35:46.855 --> 01:35:49.925
<i>The feeling is as if
they traversed the galaxy</i>

01:35:49.958 --> 01:35:52.861
<i>and now were
its only two inhabitants.</i>

01:35:52.894 --> 01:35:55.597
<i>On the furs,
they begin to make love,</i>

01:35:55.630 --> 01:35:58.000
<i>both breathing
in rhythm as one.</i>

01:35:58.033 --> 01:36:01.036
<i>They come together.
It sounds like music.</i>

01:37:56.785 --> 01:37:58.653
Um, I'm tired.

01:38:13.969 --> 01:38:16.004
I'm... I'm gonna go to sleep.

01:38:16.037 --> 01:38:18.274
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

01:38:30.253 --> 01:38:32.053
(sighs)

01:38:39.227 --> 01:38:40.862

01:38:40.896 --> 01:38:41.897
(sighs)

01:38:41.930 --> 01:38:43.031
Fuck.

01:38:45.834 --> 01:38:47.202

01:39:35.551 --> 01:39:36.885
Fuck.

01:39:38.421 --> 01:39:39.955

01:42:10.706 --> 01:42:13.342
Take this.

01:42:13.376 --> 01:42:15.210
It's all I have.

01:42:15.243 --> 01:42:17.178

01:44:06.422 --> 01:44:08.657
(bags rustling)

01:44:32.809 --> 01:44:33.897
Good evening.

01:44:35.368 --> 01:44:37.479
A quick coffee, please.

See you, thanks.

01:45:16.358 --> 01:45:17.826
Yo!

Hey!

01:45:19.495 --> 01:45:20.529
(shouting)

01:45:20.563 --> 01:45:21.864
Goddamn it, what are you...

01:45:21.897 --> 01:45:25.099
- Just stop it!
- Where are you going?

01:45:25.133 --> 01:45:27.503
- Why don't you wait for me?
- Listen, you stop.

01:45:27.536 --> 01:45:29.471
You know damn well I need you!

01:45:29.505 --> 01:45:31.239
I need you to go to the...

01:45:31.273 --> 01:45:33.609

01:45:33.642 --> 01:45:34.610
(DeeDee crying)

01:45:34.643 --> 01:45:35.644
What's wrong with you?

01:45:35.678 --> 01:45:37.245
Don't scream at her!

01:45:37.279 --> 01:45:38.547
(shouting)

01:45:38.764 --> 01:45:39.968
Fuck you!

01:45:40.449 --> 01:45:42.318
- What? Stop what?
- Don't touch me!

01:45:42.351 --> 01:45:44.118
What are you doing?
We just go out...

01:45:44.152 --> 01:45:45.621
(shouting)

01:45:45.654 --> 01:45:47.489
...and you don't even help me
with anything!

01:45:47.523 --> 01:45:48.357
Stop it!

01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:49.325
(DeeDee crying)

01:45:49.358 --> 01:45:50.726
You're a big problem!

01:45:50.759 --> 01:45:52.494
I need you, I need you.

01:45:52.528 --> 01:45:54.128
Why... why did we go out?

01:45:54.162 --> 01:45:56.130
- To fix the lamp!
- Oh my God.

01:45:56.164 --> 01:45:58.132
What do you? You run off.
What the fuck?

01:45:58.166 --> 01:46:00.469
This is not about what you do,
look at you!

01:46:00.502 --> 01:46:01.804
What? You're the problem!

01:46:01.837 --> 01:46:03.339
You're the fucking problem!

01:46:03.372 --> 01:46:04.773
Don't scream at her!

01:46:04.807 --> 01:46:08.209
Look at you, you look insane!

01:46:08.242 --> 01:46:10.211
(DeeDee crying)

01:46:10.577 --> 01:46:11.963
What happened?

01:46:12.062 --> 01:46:13.380
He's crazy!

01:46:13.649 --> 01:46:14.717
You are the problem!

01:46:14.909 --> 01:46:16.091
What happened?

01:46:16.318 --> 01:46:17.453
That's my baby!

01:46:17.918 --> 01:46:20.460
Did they steal your wallet?

01:46:20.532 --> 01:46:21.579
Nothing!

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.190
Nothing!

01:46:27.396 --> 01:46:28.564
(sighs)

01:46:29.898 --> 01:46:31.199
Fuck.

01:46:32.534 --> 01:46:34.202
(screaming)

01:46:36.839 --> 01:46:38.874

(shouting)

01:46:54.323 --> 01:46:55.524
Shit!

01:47:10.806 --> 01:47:15.377
If you really check up deeper
what you do,

01:47:15.411 --> 01:47:18.447
what you did,
since you were born up to now,

01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:22.618
which is really worthwhile
to bring the true happiness

01:47:22.651 --> 01:47:24.720
and the joyful life,
what you did?

01:47:24.753 --> 01:47:25.854
You check up.

01:47:25.888 --> 01:47:29.324
(gentle piano music)

01:47:29.358 --> 01:47:32.294
You check up.
Don't look others.

01:47:32.327 --> 01:47:34.363
You check up your own action.

01:47:36.699 --> 01:47:39.568
(rain falling)

01:47:39.601 --> 01:47:41.235
(thunder rumbling)

01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:44.707
<i>You have your body,
your speech, your mind.</i>

01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:46.675
<i>These three.</i>

01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:50.913
<i>Okay, these three actions,
what you did worthwhile?</i>

01:47:53.482 --> 01:47:55.249
You check up that way.

01:47:55.284 --> 01:47:56.852
It's so simple.

01:48:03.726 --> 01:48:05.661
(thunder cracking)

01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:19.942

01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:43.759
(wailing)

01:49:46.128 --> 01:49:47.596
Look at me.

01:49:47.629 --> 01:49:49.064
Look at me!

01:49:49.097 --> 01:49:51.133
Look at me!

01:49:51.166 --> 01:49:52.901
Look at me!

01:49:58.674 --> 01:50:00.108
No!

01:50:03.879 --> 01:50:05.781
Pull.

01:50:05.814 --> 01:50:07.616
Pull!

01:50:07.649 --> 01:50:09.151
Stop it!

01:50:09.184 --> 01:50:10.752
(crying)

01:50:10.786 --> 01:50:13.021
Stop it!

01:50:13.055 --> 01:50:15.524
(shouting)

01:50:15.557 --> 01:50:18.927
You make like you're insane!

01:50:18.961 --> 01:50:22.164
I got enough of you!

01:50:22.197 --> 01:50:25.000
I can't stand you!

01:50:25.033 --> 01:50:29.471
I don't love you, I'm sorry,
I don't love you!
