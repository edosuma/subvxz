00:58.934 --> 01:00.811
<i>Oh, no, no, no, caller.</i>

01:00.811 --> 01:03.897
<i>You're wrong as lace panties
on a hog in hot number two.</i>

01:04.647 --> 01:08.527
<i>That kid's got bright-lights-big-leagues-
scrape-your-jaw-off-the-turf talent</i>

01:08.527 --> 01:10.696
<i>with a heart true as grandma's gravy.</i>

01:10.696 --> 01:13.824
<i>And I'll eat a zone-catcher's gym sock
if he doesn't come out tonight</i>

01:13.824 --> 01:15.325
<i>pitching nuke-the-town heat.</i>

01:15.325 --> 01:16.535
<i>That's right, Vistaville.</i>

01:16.535 --> 01:20.247
<i>You're talking Volts' Jetball
with Fastball Frank on WYBS.</i>

01:20.789 --> 01:23.250
<i>Show your queen who rules the scene</i>

01:23.250 --> 01:26.211
<i>with Marvin, Vistaville's HoverCar King...</i>

01:26.211 --> 01:29.882
Joe. You look spiffy. Big plans today?

01:29.882 --> 01:33.760
I'm trying out this new day job, actually.
It's a pretty great opportunity.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.679
It won't interfere with my shifts, though.
I promise.

01:35.679 --> 01:38.056
I see. Your life, your business.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.141
It's in sales.

01:39.141 --> 01:42.144
Kind of a big change, but
with Ma's hospital bills and everything I...

01:42.144 --> 01:43.270
Sales, huh?

01:43.270 --> 01:45.939
I never figured you for the greedy,
shifty type.

01:46.899 --> 01:49.151
But hey, you go get 'em, hotshot.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.696
And if you're not a millionaire
by tonight,

01:53.405 --> 01:55.324
I got another shipment you can hump.

01:57.242 --> 02:00.287
Right. Well, thank you, Mr. Hartoonian.
I knew you'd understand.

02:02.206 --> 02:05.000
There's absolutely no reason for alarm. Stop.

02:06.710 --> 02:10.881
Up here, today's a day like any other,
spirits are sky-high. Stop.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.925
Of course,
minor launch delays are a natural part

02:12.925 --> 02:14.968
of any growing Lunar operation. Stop.

02:14.968 --> 02:18.096
Funds are out to your sales managers
to cover any refunds,

02:18.096 --> 02:20.140
but we trust
that you'll keep our customers' eyes

02:20.140 --> 02:23.101
on tomorrow's smiles, not today's delay.

02:27.022 --> 02:30.651
Sincerely, new line, Stanley Jenkins,
comma, Brightside Lunar HQ.

02:34.446 --> 02:38.742
<i>Morning, Boss.
Ready for your shave, plus cooling lotion?</i>

02:39.451 --> 02:40.369
Goddamn it!

02:40.369 --> 02:41.662
Not today!

02:56.844 --> 02:59.513
To all account managers, new line.
For immediate action.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.102
Usually, I'm the first one down.

03:06.228 --> 03:10.357
Textbook desperation-punctuality.
Look at him eating his eggs.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.568
Like a born nobody going nowhere.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.239
Hey. Big morning for ya, huh, there...

03:18.490 --> 03:19.658
Jerry?

03:19.658 --> 03:21.827
Joey. And it's nice to see you guys again.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.289
Call me Mr. Nickels,
and that's Mr. Porter.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.543
So, you ever sold anything before, Son?

03:29.543 --> 03:32.212
Oh, no.
I've mostly just worked in groceries.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.755
Retail? Wow.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.927
You know,
you really blink a lot when you talk.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.470
Might wanna work on that, seriously.

03:40.470 --> 03:44.016
Some say it gives the unconscious idea
that you're half a perv.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.267
That's a free tip.

03:45.267 --> 03:46.768
Tip I was going to say is,

03:46.768 --> 03:49.479
how the customer is always
the most important thing,

03:49.479 --> 03:52.691
and never push them,
but never take no for an answer.

03:52.691 --> 03:56.612
'Cause at the end of the day,
what comes first is always the Brightside.

03:58.322 --> 03:59.615
- Uh-huh?
- Uh-huh.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.453
What a morning! Right, Shirl?

04:04.453 --> 04:06.288
Wire came in for ya.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.207
Listen to this from the moon.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.293
Jenkins says no launches
till next quarter.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.837
That's cash to refund whoever wants out.

04:13.837 --> 04:17.089
Goddamn it!
We're out there giving people our word.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.468
Our bosses turned us
into a bunch of liars.

04:19.468 --> 04:22.137
And I got a day's worth of no-fun calls,
letting everyone know it.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.181
Well, you make a root canal sound
like great news.

04:24.181 --> 04:27.267
Then how does this sound?
Those leads are limp.

04:27.851 --> 04:31.563
We need to move on from Vistaville
or find a way to cast a wider net.

04:31.563 --> 04:35.025
- Now, I was thinking--
- Enough with the wide-net talk.

04:35.025 --> 04:38.862
We're juggling the whole fruit bowl as is.
And you know, great salesmen--

04:38.862 --> 04:40.822
Make their own turf.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.699
More like I make the turf.
But it's a nice saying.

04:42.699 --> 04:46.286
I've seen worse. Here's one.
Give the new kid half a shot.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.540
You're gonna burn a good lead
on a kid you just met?

04:50.415 --> 04:52.543
We both know
he's not closing anything today.

04:52.543 --> 04:55.045
Oh, wow. We're gonna have a hell of a day
proving you wrong.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.922
Sometimes you're like talking
to a brick wall, Jack.

04:56.922 --> 04:59.383
World's made out of brick walls, Shirl.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.469
Hey, have you seen this?

05:05.347 --> 05:08.183
<i>Jack, it's Sal from Silver Creek.</i>

05:08.934 --> 05:10.686
<i>My oldest, Nina,</i>

05:10.686 --> 05:12.896
<i>and then this little rascal, Vinny.</i>

05:12.896 --> 05:17.651
<i>He's trouble, just like Gramps.
I just can't wait to get up to the moon.</i>

05:17.651 --> 05:20.529
<i>We've got the whole clan
back together again thanks to you.</i>

05:20.529 --> 05:23.699
<i>I'm forever grateful to you, Jack.
Take care.</i>

05:23.699 --> 05:24.783
Cute kid.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.911
Kind of makes all that talk about refunds

05:27.911 --> 05:30.998
and wide nets seem pretty silly, right?

05:30.998 --> 05:35.878
He gets to be a dad again.
And we did that for him.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.131
What's better than that?

05:45.888 --> 05:46.889
Heya, Boss.

05:46.889 --> 05:49.308
- Can't wait to get started today.
- That's a new suit, isn't it?

05:49.308 --> 05:51.435
- Looking sharp.
- Yeah. Good morning, fellas.

05:51.435 --> 05:53.562
God,
great to see the three of you together.

05:53.562 --> 05:55.272
Some leads for ya.

05:55.272 --> 05:58.275
And I think I will ride with Joe today,
maybe learn a thing or two.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.069
Great one, Mr. Billings.

06:01.069 --> 06:01.987
I'm sorry.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.322
Are these today's leads,

06:03.322 --> 06:06.325
or are they rejected obituaries
for being too depressing?

06:06.325 --> 06:08.994
- Now, don't tell me you're scared.
- Don't you be afraid, Joey.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.580
Remember, you will never be worse
at this job than you are today.

06:12.206 --> 06:13.415
He's not afraid. He's...

06:14.708 --> 06:15.709
He's...

06:17.544 --> 06:19.713
Oh, no, it's... it's fine.

06:19.713 --> 06:23.884
- It's actually wiping out just great.
- No, no. Hey, don't sweat it, kid.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.302
Most mornings, I'm much worse.

06:25.302 --> 06:28.055
And I got an extra that'll go great
with that suit.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.390
Let's leave these guys here
to gripe without us.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.893
- Thanks.
- For the record, I had no gripes!

06:32.893 --> 06:33.977
Shut up, Herb.

06:33.977 --> 06:36.730
Here. I saved you boys a decent one.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.941
Pull yourself out of the hole, Ed.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.108
God bless you, Shirl.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.445
You're like one of those furry dogs in the
snow with the booze thing around its neck.

06:43.445 --> 06:47.616
Yeah. Maybe you can remind Jack
that this is a business, not a day care.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.284
Yeah, gladly. Come on, come on.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.577
<i>Have a wonderful morning.</i>

06:50.577 --> 06:51.495
Did you look at the--

06:52.621 --> 06:54.456
Thanks again for the loaner, Mr. Billings.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.375
Five bucks you call me that again.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.293
All right. Deal, Jack.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.590
The tie was my old man's.
It looks pretty good on you.

07:04.216 --> 07:06.176
Hey, you ready to take your first swing?

07:09.346 --> 07:11.306
Sure.
But I'm not gonna watch you do it first?

07:11.306 --> 07:13.392
What, and get twice as nervous waiting?

07:13.392 --> 07:17.813
No, no, no. I just mean,
I read up on everything that you gave me.

07:17.813 --> 07:19.898
I just-- I don't, I don't--

07:20.440 --> 07:21.775
You're gonna do great, kid.

07:22.734 --> 07:25.904
Okay? This is not half as hard
as asking out a girl.

07:25.904 --> 07:29.658
- And who's any good at that?
- All right, fair enough.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.869
Well, how about your first time
behind the wheel?

07:32.911 --> 07:34.413
I wouldn't really know about that.

07:35.664 --> 07:39.084
Well, what have you been doing
with yourself, Joe?

07:40.335 --> 07:41.170
We-- Hey, no.

07:41.170 --> 07:44.131
You ever play ball
and you face a full count,

07:44.131 --> 07:46.133
you swing for the fences...

07:47.050 --> 07:49.261
Watched a lot more than I played, I guess.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.473
We got a bush league team over here.
The Volts.

07:55.684 --> 07:58.645
Wait. You don't say.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.147
What do you mean?

08:00.147 --> 08:02.649
And here, why,
I wasn't even thinking you're a fan.

08:02.649 --> 08:05.068
No, no, I'm a pretty big fan, actually.

08:06.153 --> 08:09.489
Well, I got us all tickets this morning.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.826
Front row, right behind home zone.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.786
Tonight?

08:15.621 --> 08:16.997
It's game two of the semis.

08:18.707 --> 08:19.708
Higgins is pitching.

08:20.292 --> 08:21.710
Well, yeah, exactly.

08:22.211 --> 08:25.797
Only I was gonna tell you later,
like as a congrats on a great first day.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.466
- Cat's out of the bag.
- Yeah.

08:27.466 --> 08:30.928
Wow, Jack! I mean,
I don't know if I deserve it yet,

08:30.928 --> 08:32.804
but I promise I'm gonna earn it.

08:33.639 --> 08:34.806
Okay.

08:34.806 --> 08:38.227
Well, then let's rip this Band-Aid off
and make a salesman out of you.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.773
All right. Okay. Yeah, here goes.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.283
Can I help you?

08:53.867 --> 08:55.744
Hi, yes. I'm Joey Shorter.

08:57.454 --> 09:01.250
With Brightside Lunar Residences.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.085
You know, ma'am,

09:03.085 --> 09:04.962
a lot of people today
aren't actually even aware

09:04.962 --> 09:07.840
of the kinds of opportunities
that are available to them

09:07.840 --> 09:12.094
in terms of the new kind
of life that you could actually afford.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.389
Well,
maybe you've got your hands a little full

09:15.389 --> 09:17.266
with that little angel there.
We could come back?

09:17.266 --> 09:19.309
- Sure, sure.
- Great. Thanks.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.644
Y'all two gentlemen have a nice day.

09:20.644 --> 09:23.730
Well, you have a nice day too,
ma'am. It's a beautiful fam-- Beautiful--

09:27.276 --> 09:28.777
That was worse than I thought.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.279
Hey.

09:30.279 --> 09:33.198
It's great that you're tough
on yourself, but...

09:35.868 --> 09:39.162
that might have been
the best first shot I've ever seen.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.836
Marv, hon! You gotta see this!

09:45.836 --> 09:47.337
Let's show Private Brownnoser

09:47.337 --> 09:49.423
what grown men can do with a choice lead,
shall we?

09:49.423 --> 09:52.217
No need for a pep talk, Ed.
I try my best no matter what.

09:52.217 --> 09:55.804
This is perfect timing, really.
How soon can we go?

09:55.804 --> 10:00.100
A woman who knows what she wants.
Earth's finest, rarest creature.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.643
Check out that Jacuzzi.

10:01.643 --> 10:04.396
Now, picture you,
some swank bit of swimwear--

10:04.396 --> 10:05.731
What couldn't wait?

10:07.941 --> 10:08.984
And who let in these bums?

10:08.984 --> 10:10.611
Hon, you're gonna flip.

10:10.611 --> 10:12.905
All those promises
about getting away together,

10:12.905 --> 10:16.283
somewhere nice where we can be alone.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.202
I found us the perfect place.

10:20.704 --> 10:23.624
I know, Mr. Mayburn.
But most difficult decisions in my life,

10:24.208 --> 10:26.251
my wife always has the exact right answer.

10:26.251 --> 10:29.129
I should also mention
we have time-shares available

10:29.129 --> 10:31.632
for the occasional escapade.
No big commitment,

10:31.632 --> 10:34.176
- you sneak in a little bit of fun.
- I see.

10:34.176 --> 10:37.137
I always thought it took movie-star money
to get up there, no?

10:37.137 --> 10:41.558
I don't do escapades, Marv.
You said just us.

10:41.558 --> 10:45.812
Exactly! A home you could both share
together forever.

10:45.812 --> 10:50.984
Or sometimes a real man likes to keep his
options open affordably and discreetly.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.445
- Are you six years old?
- I'm not going to answer that.

10:53.445 --> 10:57.032
Then how about laying back on this one,
'cause you're way in the dark here, okay?

10:57.032 --> 10:58.617
You got a problem, Mister?

10:59.451 --> 11:01.328
No, ma'am. No, ma'am. It's all--

11:01.328 --> 11:05.457
It's hunky-dory with me. It's beautiful.
It's natural.

11:06.458 --> 11:10.170
- No, sir, love's a many-splendored thing.
- Get the hell out of my house, you creep.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.297
- Can I--
- Get the hell out!

11:12.297 --> 11:13.841
- Okay.
- Now!

11:15.759 --> 11:17.803
So, usually at lunch,

11:17.803 --> 11:20.681
we do an update on all the things
that are going really good.

11:21.598 --> 11:22.724
I try to at least.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.893
I didn't get in a single door.

11:25.561 --> 11:29.731
Doctor, front-porch-itis.
Possible terminal case.

11:30.357 --> 11:34.236
Jack's been really nice, though.
Hate to think that I'm letting him down.

11:34.236 --> 11:35.320
Probably are.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.656
Not getting in the door is
about the worst thing that you could do.

11:37.656 --> 11:41.368
Said the drooling man-child
who just botched a sure thing B-Plex.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.870
I wouldn't give up on that lead, Ed.

11:43.745 --> 11:47.040
Hey, remember that D-Plex
that I sold to you?

11:47.749 --> 11:51.628
What great things did I say then
that might help you now?

11:52.296 --> 11:53.839
Well, you were real knowledgeable.

11:54.673 --> 11:55.549
And...

11:58.010 --> 11:59.845
it was more Jack's speech, honestly.

11:59.845 --> 12:02.181
Him calling Buck Manzell
didn't hurt either.

12:02.806 --> 12:04.516
One born every minute.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.226
Who, me?

12:07.102 --> 12:10.939
You really think that an American legend
like Mr. Manzell is gonna hop on the phone

12:10.939 --> 12:14.234
twice a week
from his A-Plex just to sell for us?

12:15.235 --> 12:17.321
It was actually prerecorded.

12:17.321 --> 12:19.448
It's kind of, like,
this trick that Jack does

12:19.448 --> 12:20.741
to warm up the crowd.

12:20.741 --> 12:21.909
That's sales, rookie.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.912
Really sorry the Easter Bunny wasn't here
to break that news to you.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.079
No, I know.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.374
Know what? You two can sit here chatting

12:29.374 --> 12:30.584
like grannies at bingo.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.294
I got units to move.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.047
He's pretty hardworking, huh?

12:35.047 --> 12:36.340
We all are.

12:37.257 --> 12:41.178
I'm gonna finish my food fast,
and get back out there. You should too.

12:52.523 --> 12:54.608
Look at you.

12:54.608 --> 12:55.817
Shit!

12:58.529 --> 13:00.489
Five behind home zone. Whatever it costs.

13:00.489 --> 13:02.115
What exactly are we celebrating?

13:02.115 --> 13:04.243
Hey, it's a ball game, Shirl.

13:04.243 --> 13:06.745
You got hot dogs, happy families,
fresh-cut grass.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.747
You don't like that,
something's wrong with you.

13:08.747 --> 13:11.917
And get some popcorn for the boys
with the change. You too.

13:11.917 --> 13:15.420
- Am I writing this off as an expense?
- Course not. It's on me.

13:15.420 --> 13:19.883
Spoke to most of our sales
about the delay. Out of 48, we lost six.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.636
The Mitchells need to launch
before the baby comes.

13:22.636 --> 13:23.971
Figure try them back in a few months.

13:23.971 --> 13:27.015
And the Pearlmans are worried
there's no chiropractor.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.892
Low gravity is great for the spine.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.853
I'm trying to keep these folks happy, Jack.

13:30.853 --> 13:31.937
But I call with bad news,

13:31.937 --> 13:33.897
and they start imagining
a million new problems.

13:33.897 --> 13:36.066
But that's a great sign, Shirl.

13:36.066 --> 13:39.945
They tell us their problems,
they trust us enough to solve 'em.

13:39.945 --> 13:41.738
The kid get inside a door even?

13:43.031 --> 13:45.659
He will. And I'll tell you all about it
at the game.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.160
- If he doesn't?
- Never thought about it.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.662
That's why I have to.

13:49.955 --> 13:53.250
How about if he doesn't, you let him go?

13:54.126 --> 13:56.086
Get your mind back on sales.

13:58.964 --> 14:00.465
That's pretty cold, Shirl.

14:02.259 --> 14:03.093
But sure.

14:04.553 --> 14:07.472
- I'll lay the house on him any day.
- I got your word on that?

14:07.472 --> 14:10.767
I'll shout it from the goddamn rafters
if I have to.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.020
You can't save everyone, Jack.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.736
We do welcome pets.

14:20.736 --> 14:24.448
Here I am, laid off after 20 years
taking it no grease,

14:24.448 --> 14:28.493
and you wanna pinch what little I got left
with this shined-up horseshit?

14:28.493 --> 14:30.746
Well a man like you doing such hard work,

14:30.746 --> 14:33.415
- I'm sure you earned a carefree getaway.
- Not from you. Thanks.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.667
Don't take it from me.
I mean, just look at the numbers.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.044
Tell me, do you own your home?

14:37.044 --> 14:41.006
Why don't you tell me
how many pencil-dick suits does it take

14:41.006 --> 14:43.592
to screw a town of good people to death?

14:43.592 --> 14:46.053
You've got us all wrong, Mister.
I'm actually from Vistaville--

14:46.053 --> 14:48.180
You're scum!
Rotten bloodsuckers, all of youse!

14:48.180 --> 14:50.057
- I'm sorry you feel--
- So he's scum with his ambition?

14:50.057 --> 14:51.141
His bright future?

14:51.141 --> 14:54.603
That's great advice coming from
a ham-faced, slobbering drun--

15:05.697 --> 15:07.074
You must be Mrs. Mayburn.

15:07.074 --> 15:10.827
I am, but whatever you're selling,
my husband handles all that.

15:10.827 --> 15:11.912
Marvin.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.623
Right. Have a nice day now.

15:14.623 --> 15:17.084
Forgive me, ma'am, but...

15:19.086 --> 15:22.130
are you totally sure

15:23.340 --> 15:27.344
that this is as happy a home
as you think it is?

15:28.178 --> 15:29.346
Excuse me?

15:29.346 --> 15:31.265
I know firsthand...

15:32.432 --> 15:35.978
that a loving marriage is built on trust.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.274
So, if you're planning a getaway

15:40.274 --> 15:43.777
or a fresh start
somewhere very far away from here,

15:44.653 --> 15:48.323
I would do my best
to give you a great deal.

15:51.577 --> 15:53.036
That's enough, thanks.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.621
Are you familiar with a Cindy?

15:57.249 --> 15:59.084
I met her. Here.

16:01.128 --> 16:01.962
Earlier.

16:03.338 --> 16:07.968
And all I could say is a woman of quality,
like yourself,

16:08.594 --> 16:09.928
deserves better.

16:16.185 --> 16:17.603
Easy for you to say.

16:18.687 --> 16:22.191
If it helps,
he was ready to do the same thing to you.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.706
Could be the escape
you've always dreamed of.

16:52.471 --> 16:54.515
Well, you know what?
I learned a lot today.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.852
There are gonna be more leads tomorrow, right?

17:02.564 --> 17:04.650
You remember the grandma
that you had earlier,

17:04.650 --> 17:07.944
who begged off to get her cookies
out of the oven? She liked you.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.070
I guess.

17:09.070 --> 17:12.491
So, pretend that I'm her, okay?
You just gave a good pitch.

17:12.491 --> 17:15.410
The smell of cookies is drifting in
from the kitchen.

17:15.410 --> 17:18.454
Now I gotta go get 'em out of the oven
before they burn. You're up.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.750
Okay, well, ma'am,

17:21.750 --> 17:23.836
if I could just have another moment
of your time--

17:23.836 --> 17:26.088
No, no, no. They're burning right now.
I just told you that.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.382
Well, I'm happy to wait
on the stoop until you get back--

17:28.382 --> 17:31.093
Like a Peeping Tom? Oh, no thanks.

17:31.635 --> 17:33.512
Trust me, ma'am,
you don't know the opportunities

17:33.512 --> 17:35.722
- that you're missing on the moon.
- So now I'm stupid?

17:35.722 --> 17:37.099
- I'm d--
- Smell the cookies, Joe!

17:37.099 --> 17:39.351
Your grandchildren
would have a great asset

17:39.351 --> 17:41.395
- that you can leave to--
- Jesus!

17:47.776 --> 17:50.988
Smell 'em. And what do you say?

17:53.740 --> 17:55.158
Smells pretty good.

17:58.036 --> 18:00.622
Pardon me, sonny? Little hard of hearing.

18:00.622 --> 18:02.291
The cookies smell great, ma'am.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.545
What are-- What are they, chocolate chip?

18:06.545 --> 18:11.967
Well, yes. Thank you for asking finally.

18:11.967 --> 18:14.136
Now, would you like to come in
and share one with me,

18:14.136 --> 18:17.681
and sell me on my new life
that I desperately need?

18:17.681 --> 18:21.185
Because my husband is dead,
my kids don't call,

18:21.185 --> 18:24.188
and I spend my days baking cookies
and eating them alone.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.690
Do you think she's really that sad?

18:29.526 --> 18:32.446
And if we don't help her, who will?

18:39.244 --> 18:40.287
What if--

18:41.538 --> 18:43.749
What if I didn't actually
smell the cookies?

18:45.375 --> 18:47.920
You better damn well find a way
to smell 'em.

18:49.922 --> 18:52.090
How about we try another one, okay?

18:52.591 --> 18:56.345
Just get inside one door.

18:58.472 --> 19:00.057
Okay. Okay.

19:00.057 --> 19:01.141
All right.

19:09.107 --> 19:10.400
Come on, kid.

19:11.443 --> 19:13.028
Let's go, Joe.

19:16.949 --> 19:17.950
Find a way.

19:23.372 --> 19:24.873
Come on, Joe.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.922
Yeah! There he is!

19:31.922 --> 19:33.966
That's my boy.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.521
The hell, Eddie?

19:48.105 --> 19:49.982
Who are you hiding from?

19:49.982 --> 19:52.526
What, is napping a criminal offense now?

19:52.526 --> 19:55.904
So that solemn vow you made last night,
all blubbering and naked,

19:55.904 --> 19:58.699
how I'm the only bet you'll ever need,
that didn't stick?

19:58.699 --> 20:01.201
It stuck. And then it unstuck.

20:01.702 --> 20:02.703
What the--

20:03.412 --> 20:05.080
Shirley, what is this?

20:05.873 --> 20:09.710
Maybe you're unfamiliar.
It's money that hasn't been pissed away.

20:11.086 --> 20:14.298
They let you hold bags that size,
and you didn't tell me about it?

20:14.298 --> 20:19.178
Yeah, don't get too aroused. It's refunds.
They're pushing launches.

20:19.178 --> 20:21.430
Sweet sadistic Christ. Are you kidding me?

20:21.430 --> 20:23.307
Humble salesmen are already drowning.

20:23.307 --> 20:25.184
Now they're gonna throw that turd
in the pool?

20:25.184 --> 20:28.520
Jack's taking the new kid to a ball game.
We get to tag along.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.605
Is that right?

20:30.939 --> 20:32.357
Shir-- Wait, Shirley?

20:32.941 --> 20:38.238
I'm having a vision of me and that bag
at a game at a wager window,

20:38.238 --> 20:39.406
and many, if not all,

20:39.406 --> 20:42.409
of my financial problems
just valiantly solved.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.579
Maybe we can find a better plan
than you losing more money

20:45.579 --> 20:47.206
that you don't have.

20:51.043 --> 20:53.045
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

20:53.921 --> 20:59.843
<i>welcome to game two of the semifinals
at Volt Park in Vistaville</i>

20:59.843 --> 21:04.014
<i>for tonight's match-up
between the Denver Dynamos</i>

21:04.014 --> 21:06.266
<i>and the Vistaville Volts.</i>

21:06.266 --> 21:08.227
- Look at these seats, right?
- Yeah.

21:09.061 --> 21:11.897
- Never been this close before.
- You earned this today.

21:11.897 --> 21:14.107
Tore off the training wheels,
never looked back.

21:15.025 --> 21:17.444
Might have helped
if I had actually made the sale.

21:19.029 --> 21:22.950
Now, as your boss, I'm telling you
to forget about all of that

21:22.950 --> 21:24.493
and enjoy the game. Okay?

21:24.493 --> 21:25.619
Right.

21:28.914 --> 21:31.291
Hey, guys? Great seats.

21:31.291 --> 21:36.672
You know I played right zone
in junior high, right? Nacho?

21:36.672 --> 21:39.508
Watch hi-- Shirley, Shirl,
watch Higgins' lateral.

21:39.508 --> 21:44.555
Tell me that is not a game-botching
hammy injury he is hiding at plus 160,

21:44.555 --> 21:47.391
and us
with a rare capital opportunity here.

21:47.391 --> 21:49.685
You're hallucinating.
He's just stretching.

21:49.685 --> 21:51.436
What? Look at him.

21:51.436 --> 21:53.730
<i>Show your queen who rules the scene,</i>

21:53.730 --> 21:55.566
<i>with a royal deal on high-class wheels.</i>

21:55.566 --> 21:59.695
Oh, this putz. In real life,
this guy is unnervingly tall,

21:59.695 --> 22:01.113
he two-times his wife,

22:01.113 --> 22:03.490
and he's got a scraggly dusting
of chest hair.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.367
But he's the one rolling in dough.

22:05.367 --> 22:09.413
<i>Marvin, Vistaville's hovercar king.</i>

22:09.413 --> 22:12.082
"Great salesmen make their own turf."

22:12.791 --> 22:14.001
What?

22:17.129 --> 22:18.672
Shir-- Where are you going?

22:22.551 --> 22:24.803
Look at him, Herb,
he's practically crippled.

22:25.721 --> 22:28.932
Oh, gee-- I--
I forgot that thing in Shirley's car.

22:30.851 --> 22:32.519
<i>...melting NachoPole here.</i>

22:33.103 --> 22:35.230
You know what's missing?
A couple of cold ones.

22:35.230 --> 22:37.482
You want to come track down a BarBot
with me?

22:37.482 --> 22:39.443
- No, I'm fine.
- None for me, thanks.

22:44.823 --> 22:48.535
Come on. Come on. Where's that damn car?

22:51.705 --> 22:54.082
Selling one
would be a great next goal for you.

22:54.082 --> 22:55.918
For now, you should be proud.

22:55.918 --> 23:00.797
Getting in the door is a good step,
considering how bad you were doing.

23:00.797 --> 23:04.718
Hey, can I tell you something?
Just between us?

23:04.718 --> 23:06.678
Sure. I'm very trustworthy.

23:07.971 --> 23:10.724
I didn't actually get in that door today.

23:13.393 --> 23:16.146
I just paid the guy ten bucks
to let me stand inside a while.

23:16.813 --> 23:17.981
Why?

23:17.981 --> 23:20.859
I don't know. For Jack, you know?

23:21.735 --> 23:25.239
Well, you ended up lying to him,
which is definitely worse.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.034
Right, yeah. Feels that way.

23:29.660 --> 23:30.786
Hey, Joey?

23:30.786 --> 23:32.287
I can keep this a secret.

23:33.705 --> 23:37.292
I'm just worried it's gonna hang
over your head the rest of your career.

23:46.718 --> 23:48.011
Hey, can you--

23:48.595 --> 23:53.684
Do you think you could give this to Jack
when he gets back, and just tell him...

23:55.352 --> 23:57.229
- that I'm sorry?
- Sure thing.

23:57.229 --> 24:00.023
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise for the national anthem.</i>

24:33.307 --> 24:35.184
Shit. Shit.

24:36.768 --> 24:38.103
Goddamn it, Shirl.

24:40.939 --> 24:41.940
Come on.

24:42.691 --> 24:43.775
Play ball.

24:44.985 --> 24:46.195
No!

24:47.196 --> 24:52.701
<i>At the end of the fifth inning,
number 15, Johnny Zapp.</i>

24:52.701 --> 24:57.080
He got in a door, Shirl. Goddamn, did it.

24:57.789 --> 25:01.543
You did right by him, Jack.
Not your fault he's not ready.

25:03.337 --> 25:06.632
<i>Third striker. You are out.</i>

25:07.799 --> 25:11.887
<i>Three, two, one, blast off.</i>

25:11.887 --> 25:13.388
Hey, that's our ad.

25:13.388 --> 25:15.724
<i>...to a new beginning beyond the stars.</i>

25:15.724 --> 25:18.852
Goddamn, Shirl. That's how you spent it?
The balls on you.

25:18.852 --> 25:21.271
<i>Brightside Lunar Residences are the new...</i>

25:21.271 --> 25:24.441
Look at this crowd.
Imagine if we sold all of them.

25:24.441 --> 25:26.485
<i>Our collection of fully furnished...</i>

25:26.485 --> 25:30.113
What do you say, Jack?
Making our own turf.

25:30.113 --> 25:31.365
You're way out of your depth.

25:31.365 --> 25:35.035
Shirl, how are we supposed to handle
this type of volume?

25:35.035 --> 25:37.412
You got no clue
how this is gonna play out.

25:37.412 --> 25:41.291
<i>Home is where the happiness is,
not the headaches. Where you're free--</i>

25:41.291 --> 25:43.627
...<i>easy to be your best.</i>

25:43.627 --> 25:47.506
<i>To live, love and laugh,
and leave the strains and stresses...</i>

25:48.674 --> 25:51.760
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

25:51.760 --> 25:54.930
Well,
that's not where I would have put 'em.

25:56.098 --> 25:59.351
But hey, that's why God made mops.

26:10.237 --> 26:13.323
Don't hurt yourself helping out
too much there, Mr. Salesman.

26:16.159 --> 26:18.161
Guess you hit the jackpot today, huh?

26:18.954 --> 26:21.331
That's why you're still half asleep
on the job.

26:21.331 --> 26:25.460
- I can take care of this on my own.
- That bad out there, huh?

26:25.460 --> 26:28.338
Well, I'm just glad you're back
in real life.

26:29.423 --> 26:31.133
Hope you can stay a while.

26:36.346 --> 26:41.393
You know, the day went great, actually.
I closed three before noon.

26:41.393 --> 26:43.604
"One of the best days a rookie's had,"
my boss said.

26:43.604 --> 26:46.398
Really? You pulling my leg?

26:47.441 --> 26:48.650
Thanks for believing in me.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.736
Oh, no. Hey, hey, not that.

26:50.736 --> 26:52.237
And the company's really taking off.

26:52.237 --> 26:54.656
You know, Jack says it's an opportunity
for a real career.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.158
You don't say.

26:56.158 --> 26:59.494
I guess people must really be getting sick
of life down here, huh?

27:00.704 --> 27:03.290
Sure. Well, I mean, w-- Can you blame 'em?

27:04.333 --> 27:05.626
I'll tell you one thing.

27:06.502 --> 27:09.505
You're never gonna catch me
in one of those rockets.

27:11.965 --> 27:13.300
No, of course. Of course not.

27:15.177 --> 27:17.387
Boy, I mean,
you have your whole store here.

27:17.387 --> 27:19.306
I mean, this place is your whole world.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.310
Lemme tell ya,

27:23.310 --> 27:25.479
you would not believe the rockets
they have now.

27:26.438 --> 27:28.899
Plush seats, cocktail waitresses.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.778
Hey, I get it's not for you.

28:05.269 --> 28:06.270
Myrtle?

28:09.606 --> 28:11.608
Hey! Myrtle?

28:14.027 --> 28:15.696
Myrtle!

28:42.181 --> 28:44.349
Hey, Jack! Look.

28:44.349 --> 28:45.350
Joey, hey.

28:45.350 --> 28:47.936
I'm sorry that I cut out
of the game early, but,

28:48.812 --> 28:51.273
I just remembered
I had this great lead to work.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.319
I sold him a C-Plex.

29:01.783 --> 29:04.369
I knew you had it, kid.

29:04.369 --> 29:07.122
Everything it's ever going to take,
you got it in you.

29:07.122 --> 29:09.917
Well, I just did what you taught me.
"Smell the cookies," basically.

29:09.917 --> 29:11.585
How did it feel?

29:12.836 --> 29:14.004
The best.

29:15.214 --> 29:16.757
I never found anything to beat it.

29:20.260 --> 29:21.803
Hey, what's going on in there?

29:21.803 --> 29:23.597
Well, we're about to have a big night.

29:23.597 --> 29:25.807
Yeah, I heard the ad on the radio.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.059
It's pretty neat.

29:29.603 --> 29:30.938
Aren't we gonna answer them?

29:35.400 --> 29:36.944
Just waiting on a little help.

30:02.469 --> 30:03.595
Hi, this is Joey Shorter

30:03.595 --> 30:05.806
- with Brightside Lunar Residences.
- <i>Oh. Hello.</i>

30:05.806 --> 30:07.808
And how can I be of assistance, ma'am?

30:08.475 --> 30:09.726
Absolutely, of course.

30:09.726 --> 30:12.938
Now we have multiple plans that I'm sure
you'll be over the moon about.

30:12.938 --> 30:16.275
We have A-Plex, B-Plex or a C-Plex
if you would prefer.

30:16.275 --> 30:19.528
Of course, D-Plex is,
one that I started with, but honestly,

30:19.528 --> 30:21.238
when I got up there, I knew that...
