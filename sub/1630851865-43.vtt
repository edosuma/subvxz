[Moon] Are you ready?

00:34.519 --> 00:36.400
Stanley, where are you?

00:36.519 --> 00:38.800
It's time to go to your family reunion!

00:38.920 --> 00:40.760
Oh, I can't wait to go to Canada

00:40.879 --> 00:43.720
and meet all your snail relatives
from around the world

00:43.839 --> 00:45.640
and play games and--

00:46.320 --> 00:48.000
[sniffs] What's that smell?

00:48.120 --> 00:50.760
My soup. I think I burned it.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.760
Really? Wow!

00:53.879 --> 00:57.440
How do you burn soup?
Isn't it made of water?

00:57.559 --> 00:59.800
[sighs] It's no use.

00:59.919 --> 01:02.879
Every year my family
gives out awards at the reunion.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.280
And this year,
I was hoping I could finally win one.

01:06.679 --> 01:09.119
But everything I try is a failure.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.800
[sighs] My soup isn't even
close to as yummy as Grammy's.

01:12.920 --> 01:15.759
-It tastes like burnt glue!
-Oh, Come on.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.679
It can't be <i>that </i>bad!

01:20.039 --> 01:21.720
-Burnt glue?
-I wish.

01:21.839 --> 01:22.759
Oh...

01:22.880 --> 01:24.640
Estella paints better than I do.

01:24.759 --> 01:26.360
Tucci's a better photographer.

01:26.479 --> 01:29.479
And Cousin Bret may be
a terrible bagpipe player,

01:29.600 --> 01:30.920
but he's still better than me!

01:31.839 --> 01:35.440
I guess I should just get used to going
unnoticed and unappreciated

01:35.560 --> 01:37.920
at the Snail Family Award Ceremony.

01:38.039 --> 01:39.119
Again.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.960
Aw, come on, Stanley!

01:41.080 --> 01:43.000
You can win an award
for something!

01:43.320 --> 01:45.839
You have all kinds of talents and skills!

01:46.360 --> 01:48.720
I do? Really? Like what?

01:50.160 --> 01:52.280
Like... er...

01:52.440 --> 01:54.640
Like... uh...

01:54.800 --> 01:57.440
-So many things!
-Too many to count!

01:57.559 --> 02:00.759
So, we'll talk about it when we get there!

02:00.880 --> 02:02.280
Yep! Don't want to be late!

02:02.880 --> 02:04.320
-To the reunion!
-Whoa!

02:10.400 --> 02:11.640
Whoo!

02:12.600 --> 02:14.359
Whee!

02:21.799 --> 02:25.600
<i>Now arriving in cottage country, Canada!</i>

02:26.160 --> 02:27.280
<i>Yay!</i>

02:29.959 --> 02:35.200
Oh, Ollie! Moon!
Welcome to the family cottage!

02:35.320 --> 02:37.040
Hi! Nice to see you again!

02:38.040 --> 02:41.440
Just look at these wonderful,
widdle, wuvs!

02:41.600 --> 02:43.600
Wuzza-wuzza-wuzza!

02:43.720 --> 02:47.200
It's so good to see you!

02:47.480 --> 02:49.079
Buongiorno!

02:49.200 --> 02:51.959
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah!

02:52.079 --> 02:54.400
[muffled] Delightful to see you guys.

02:54.519 --> 02:57.480
-What did he just say?
-I have no idea.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.440
He's got toffee in his mouth again!

02:59.560 --> 03:01.239
Hi, everybody!

03:01.359 --> 03:04.640
-Hey! Who's up for cards?
-Um. OK!

03:04.799 --> 03:07.160
Grab a chair
and enjoy some Canadian nature!

03:07.320 --> 03:08.480
[sighs]

03:10.560 --> 03:14.160
Cousin Stanley! You're here!

03:14.280 --> 03:16.480
Tina! I couldn't see you there!

03:16.600 --> 03:18.480
Hop on, kiddo! I'll give you a ride!

03:18.600 --> 03:21.560
Oh! Giddy-up, horsey!

03:21.679 --> 03:23.519
[giggles] Whee!

03:25.000 --> 03:26.640
[laughs]

03:30.280 --> 03:32.880
We have a few minutes
before Stanley catches up to us.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.959
Now, how are we going to win him an award?

03:36.320 --> 03:38.359
[gasps] I'm having a brainstorm!

03:38.480 --> 03:42.040
We can launch Stanley into space
for an astronaut award!

03:42.160 --> 03:43.760
But then he'll be in space.

03:44.359 --> 03:46.600
How about juggling?
I'll bet he can juggle!

03:46.880 --> 03:48.560
Stanley, catch!

03:50.880 --> 03:51.720
Oy...

03:51.840 --> 03:55.399
What about something sporty,
just without balls?

03:55.519 --> 03:58.640
Or what about a smart award
for knowing lots of stuff?

03:58.760 --> 03:59.720
-Sports!
-Smarts!

03:59.839 --> 04:01.760
-Sports!
-Smarts!

04:01.880 --> 04:03.440
I know! How about both?

04:03.560 --> 04:06.239
Hi, guys!
So what's the plan for winning my award?

04:06.359 --> 04:09.519
-Lots and lots of training!
-Starting now!

04:10.799 --> 04:14.440
Seriously? You really think
I can win a sports award, Moon?

04:14.560 --> 04:16.599
Of course you can! Now up you go!

04:17.079 --> 04:18.120
Seriously.

04:18.240 --> 04:19.079
[groans]

04:19.200 --> 04:20.079
Oh!

04:25.760 --> 04:27.840
[panting]

04:27.960 --> 04:28.880
Oh!

04:29.320 --> 04:31.719
Oh, good, you're here. Time to study!

04:32.000 --> 04:35.039
-Study? For a sports award?
-No.

04:35.159 --> 04:37.200
For your Smartest Snail award!

04:37.320 --> 04:39.640
Ready, set, memorise!

04:40.760 --> 04:42.320
But I'm so tired.

04:43.039 --> 04:44.440
Oh...

04:45.640 --> 04:46.919
Wow!

04:48.599 --> 04:50.440
Come on, Stanley! You're doing great!

04:50.560 --> 04:52.479
I just know you can make it
to 100 pull-ups.

04:52.599 --> 04:54.200
[groans]

04:57.039 --> 04:59.440
-Yay!
-How many is that?

04:59.560 --> 05:02.000
One! Only 99 more to go!

05:02.680 --> 05:04.120
[groans]

05:06.360 --> 05:07.719
Oh!

05:07.840 --> 05:08.960
Name these capitals!

05:09.719 --> 05:11.680
Paris, France! Beijing, China!

05:12.240 --> 05:13.080
Nairobi, Kenya!

05:13.400 --> 05:15.719
Stanley's worked out really hard.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.280
How's he doing with the quizzing?

05:17.400 --> 05:20.800
He's studied so hard
his eye-stalks are crossed.

05:20.919 --> 05:21.760
Uh-oh!

05:22.960 --> 05:24.560
So, am I ready?

05:24.680 --> 05:26.000
To win a sports award?

05:26.120 --> 05:28.240
A Smartest Snail award?

05:28.359 --> 05:30.960
-Yes!
-Nothing can stop you now!

05:31.080 --> 05:34.440
Chad! Chad!

05:34.560 --> 05:38.080
-Except maybe Chad.
-Chad!

05:38.200 --> 05:42.039
Ha, ha! Greetings, family.

05:42.159 --> 05:47.200
One moment while I effortlessly
park this heavy, heavy canoe.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.080
[everyone] Ooh.

05:50.200 --> 05:51.840
[everyone] Aah.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.680
Sure, he may be athletic...

05:55.800 --> 05:57.599
But is he smart?

05:57.719 --> 05:59.919
No way! Not a chance!

06:00.039 --> 06:05.800
Oh, Grammy. I haven't seen you
in 268,584 minutes,

06:05.919 --> 06:08.400
since which time
I learned all the languages of the world

06:08.520 --> 06:10.479
and memorized everything.

06:10.599 --> 06:14.719
Oh, my super smart son-in-law!

06:14.840 --> 06:17.960
I'm so glad you married our Estella!

06:18.080 --> 06:19.919
Yup. Smart.

06:20.039 --> 06:21.560
Pretty hard to beat that.

06:21.760 --> 06:24.039
Hmm. What about ballet?

06:24.159 --> 06:25.840
-Or archery?
-Piano?

06:25.960 --> 06:28.320
-Karate!
-Extreme origami!

06:28.560 --> 06:30.840
Whaddaya say, Stanley?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.520
Stanley? Where'd he go?

06:32.640 --> 06:34.320
Did we scare him off?

06:35.640 --> 06:38.479
In my family,
there's always someone better than me.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.440
I'm just not special enough.

06:40.560 --> 06:43.960
I'm too small and too weak.

06:44.080 --> 06:46.479
And too unco-ordinat...

06:46.599 --> 06:49.680
Hey! Whoa!

06:51.039 --> 06:52.599
Aaah! Ugh!

06:54.159 --> 06:55.000
Uh-oh.

06:55.120 --> 06:58.039
Hello? Help!

06:58.159 --> 06:59.599
Anybody?

06:59.719 --> 07:01.719
Please?

07:01.840 --> 07:03.320
Stanley!

07:03.440 --> 07:05.880
Yoo-hoo! Where are you?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Has anybody seen Stanley?

07:11.479 --> 07:12.799
Uh, hello?

07:13.120 --> 07:16.760
-Has anybody seen Stanley?
-Hi, kitties!

07:17.359 --> 07:21.440
Say, you haven't seen Stanley, have you?

07:21.760 --> 07:24.080
No, we can't find him anywhere.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.599
I'm worried, Ollie!
He's gone, and I think it's our fault!

07:28.159 --> 07:31.599
We've been so busy trying
to make him something he's not,

07:31.719 --> 07:33.760
we forgot the most special thing
about him!

07:33.919 --> 07:35.799
What a good friend he is!

07:35.919 --> 07:37.799
Come on! We have to find him!

07:41.760 --> 07:43.000
Well, this is just great.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.880
Not only am I not getting an award,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.039
I'm stuck in the middle of the lake!

07:47.159 --> 07:48.440
[crying]

07:48.560 --> 07:50.200
Huh? What was that?

07:53.719 --> 07:55.919
Tina? Are you hiding?

07:56.039 --> 07:57.960
What happened?
You look sadder than that time

07:58.120 --> 08:00.320
you dropped your marshmallow
into the campfire!

08:01.359 --> 08:03.560
No. It's just...

08:03.679 --> 08:08.440
I love my family and all,
but I just don't measure up

08:08.560 --> 08:13.080
to all my big,
amazing snail relatives, like...

08:13.200 --> 08:16.359
-Chad?
-No. You!

08:16.679 --> 08:19.919
-Me?
-I've been watching all day

08:20.039 --> 08:23.359
and I could never be as amazing as you.

08:23.479 --> 08:26.760
Uh, I think you have me mixed up
with somebody who's not me.

08:26.880 --> 08:30.320
Nuh-uh. You're an amazing friend!

08:30.440 --> 08:34.919
You're so kind with Ollie and Moon
and never get angry,

08:35.079 --> 08:37.000
even when things go wrong.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.159
Oh! I don't know.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.400
I guess that's true.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.520
And Ollie and Moon
wouldn't go to so much trouble

08:43.640 --> 08:47.480
if they didn't think
you were amazing, too!

08:47.600 --> 08:49.840
I sure look up to you!

08:51.240 --> 08:54.560
You know what, Tina?
That makes me feel kinda special.

08:54.760 --> 08:57.000
Don't you worry. I'll get us out of here,

08:57.120 --> 09:00.480
because I'm Stanley and I'm special!

09:04.920 --> 09:07.640
-Stanley!
-Stanley! There you are!

09:08.840 --> 09:11.439

09:55.400 --> 09:57.839
The Friendship Award,

09:57.959 --> 10:01.640
for being the best friend
a snail could be!

10:01.760 --> 10:03.880
[cheering]

10:04.040 --> 10:05.280
Hurray!

10:05.400 --> 10:07.360
Thanks, everybody. I'm touched.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.800
And I have something to share, too.

10:10.640 --> 10:12.760
Find it. It should be right... Oh!

10:12.920 --> 10:15.560
What is that doing here?
Ah, ha, ha! Found it!

10:15.920 --> 10:17.280
Oh!

10:17.400 --> 10:20.199
For our little cousin, Tina,
the Helpful Award,

10:20.360 --> 10:23.280
for helping me realise I'm special, too.

10:23.400 --> 10:27.880
What a great idea, giving awards
for friendship and helpfulness!

10:28.000 --> 10:31.959
Hmm. That gives <i>me </i>an idea!

10:32.920 --> 10:34.319
Best Cats awards!

10:34.439 --> 10:36.839
That was so nice of Grammy
to give us these.

10:36.959 --> 10:39.560
But weren't we the only cats?

10:39.720 --> 10:42.400
Yeah, so you totally deserve them!

10:44.959 --> 10:47.640
-Er... Stanley?
-What are you doing?

10:47.760 --> 10:49.480
Oh, practising for next year.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.880
For the Extreme Origami award!

10:52.040 --> 10:53.199
[chuckles]

10:53.760 --> 10:54.680
A swan!

10:54.800 --> 10:56.480
[laughter]

10:56.600 --> 10:59.120
Wow! That's awesome, Stanley!

11:00.079 --> 11:03.160
[lively music]
