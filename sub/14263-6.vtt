It'll turn this vault
into a giant pressure-cooker.

And we're the ones

So was ours.

It was a couple of years ago.

<i>We were scouting the rooftops</i>

<i>And he just robbed</i>
<i>the city treasury.</i>

16:21.913 --> 16:24.615
<i>We left him tied up there</i>
<i>for the police to find.</i>

16:25.817 --> 16:28.318
[ Carter ]
So Fripp
is the same guy as Chronos?

16:28.386 --> 16:31.588
Well, if he is, his taste
in clothes has really
gone down the tubes.

16:31.656 --> 16:35.325
Yeah, but didn't Chronos
call himself the king
of the clock tower?

16:35.393 --> 16:37.327
Yeah, and he said
something else.

16:37.395 --> 16:39.596
He said he knew
where we live.

But he'll destroy Splinter
if we attack him.

17:15.066 --> 17:19.403
Maybe not, guys.
He didn't say anything about me.
He hasn't mentioned me once.

17:19.470 --> 17:24.208
Yeah, if Chronos is
Winston Fripp, he wouldn't
know anything about Carter.

We think Chronos is--
<i>[ April ] Winston Fripp?</i>

- How did you know?
- Because it all fits.

17:31.182 --> 17:35.052
Fripp was fired from

He robbed the city treasury
for revenge,

17:37.555 --> 17:39.623
which is where you guys
caught up with him.

17:39.691 --> 17:43.593

to find him after you left him
tied up in the clock tower.

In the meantime,
these four concussion generators
will shake the city apart,

of the concussion generators.

20:31.329 --> 20:35.065
Of course.

straight into the clock's
machinery!

Precisely, Turtles.
