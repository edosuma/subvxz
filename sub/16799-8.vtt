00:10.810 --> 00:12.505
HOLMES:
Watson, I've gone to a meeting.

00:12.540 --> 00:14.371
Please rev_iew the matter
of the SIX Napoleons,

00:14.410 --> 00:16.378
as the client has asked
for an update.

00:16.410 --> 00:18.173
I'll join you when I return.

00:18.210 --> 00:20.371
I advise you not to use
the refrigerator this morning.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.081
My experiments in fermentation

00:22.120 --> 00:24.418
find themselves
at a critical stage.

00:24.450 --> 00:27.283
(doorbell buzzes)

00:33.660 --> 00:34.797
Good morning.

00:34.830 --> 00:36.468
I'm calling on Sherlock Holmes.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.195
He's not here right now.

00:38.230 --> 00:39.492
I'm his partner, Joan Watson.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.393
Can I help you
with something?

00:40.440 --> 00:41.793
You look familiar.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.569
Are you a friend of Bill W?

00:43.610 --> 00:46.374
More like a friend of a friend.

00:46.410 --> 00:48.731
But you've been to meetings
at St. Olaf's

00:48.780 --> 00:51.169
with Sherlock?

00:51.210 --> 00:53.269
My name is Holder.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.417
I was wondering ifI might

00:55.450 --> 00:57.384
leave something with you.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.648
Sherlock's not really
big on hats,

01:06.700 --> 01:09.294
so I'm not sure
he's gonna want a crown.

01:09.330 --> 01:11.662
It's a coronet,
technically.

01:11.700 --> 01:14.191
Holmes calls it
my "beryl coronet."

01:14.240 --> 01:17.107
Uh, the stones are
replicas, of course.

01:17.140 --> 01:18.664
The entire thing's
a simulacrum.

01:18.710 --> 01:21.406
I'm certain it'll be
very well received.

01:21.440 --> 01:24.204
He says it reminds him
of a case from London.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.808
Um, if you don't mind
me asking,

01:25.850 --> 01:28.341
why are you giving him
a beryl coronet?

01:28.380 --> 01:30.848
Holmes did a favor for me.

01:30.890 --> 01:34.417
I have a recovering addict's
hatred for owing favors.

01:34.460 --> 01:36.348
I mailed several checks

01:36.390 --> 01:38.187
to compensate him
for his time, but

01:38.230 --> 01:39.424
they went uncashed.
This, perhaps,

01:39.460 --> 01:40.529
will settle the matter
between us.

01:40.560 --> 01:41.857
Mm-hmm.

01:41.900 --> 01:43.527
Well, you're welcome
to leave it here,

01:43.570 --> 01:45.322
but if you'd rather
give it to him in person,

01:45.370 --> 01:47.838
uh, Sherlock is actually at a
meeting at St. Olaf's right now.

01:47.870 --> 01:49.633
St. Olaf's-- you sure?

01:49.670 --> 01:51.399
I'm positive. Why?

01:51.440 --> 01:55.331
We haven't seen
Sherlock there in ages.

01:55.380 --> 01:57.439
In fact, he told us
specifically he was going

01:57.480 --> 01:59.243
to another regular session
in Greenpoint.

02:00.420 --> 02:02.149
Variety, you know.

02:02.190 --> 02:04.249
Really?
Are you sure?

02:04.290 --> 02:05.416
Well, I don't live there,

02:05.450 --> 02:07.452
but I am a regular.

02:07.490 --> 02:08.582
I'd put it at
a month since

02:08.620 --> 02:09.757
we've seen Sherlock.

02:10.760 --> 02:12.751
(cell phone chimes)

02:15.630 --> 02:18.428
Is everything
all right, my dear?

02:18.470 --> 02:20.529
Yes, yes. I just...

02:20.570 --> 02:21.889
I didn't realize
he had made the switch.

02:21.940 --> 02:22.907
Mm.

02:22.940 --> 02:25.431
Anyway, I'm happy to keep
an eye on your crown.

02:25.470 --> 02:28.439
Um, your coronet.

02:28.480 --> 02:29.799
Did Hawes tell you
what we're doing here?

02:29.850 --> 02:32.171
I did not ask.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.642
He knows we discriminate
in the work we take on,

02:33.680 --> 02:35.910
so I trust
his judgment.

02:35.950 --> 02:37.542
How was the meeting?

02:37.590 --> 02:39.410
Oh, capital.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.416
The usual, St. Olaf's?

02:41.460 --> 02:43.280
Yeah, that's right.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.286
Morning, sir.
Morning.

02:45.330 --> 02:47.525
This is Efraim Albright,

02:47.560 --> 02:49.596
He died last night
from an allergic reaction

02:49.630 --> 02:51.666
to romifidine hydrochloride.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.668
They market that as a product
called Equithesia.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.361
Animal tranquilizer
used primarily

02:55.400 --> 02:56.469
in equine surgery.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.909
It's potent stuff.

02:57.940 --> 03:00.909
I think Mr. Albright here
took it by accident,

03:00.940 --> 03:02.646
but there's a lot more
I'd like to know

03:02.680 --> 03:04.409
before I issue
the autopsy report.

03:04.450 --> 03:05.678
Man ingests horse
tranquilizer and dies.

03:05.710 --> 03:07.211
That's hardly a
problem for the ages.

03:07.250 --> 03:08.239
Why did you contact us?

03:08.280 --> 03:09.486
You didn't let me finish.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.579
I'm pretty sure
there's foul play here.

03:11.620 --> 03:12.814
I don't think Mr. Albright

03:12.860 --> 03:14.282
ingested the horse
tranquilizer directly.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.584
There appear to be
sausage casings

03:16.630 --> 03:18.825
inside Efraim
Albright's stomach.

03:18.860 --> 03:21.420
According to the
toxicology report,

03:21.460 --> 03:23.769
the meat in those casings
contains human remains.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.564
That meat is tainted
with Equithesia.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.397
So he didn't die from
taking a horse sedative.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.432
He died from eating someone
who took a horse sedative?

03:31.470 --> 03:33.279
I think so. Yes.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.645
*

04:11.050 --> 04:12.642
I'll spend some time
over in Missing Persons,

04:12.680 --> 04:14.409
but I'm pretty sure
they won't be looking

04:14.450 --> 04:16.589
for anyone who matches
the description of a hot dog.

04:16.620 --> 04:17.939
HOLMES:
Sausage.

04:17.990 --> 04:19.309
Oh, a sausage.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.420
That'll clear things up.

04:22.460 --> 04:24.348
So the question is

04:24.390 --> 04:27.029
did Albright know
he was eating someone?

04:27.060 --> 04:29.028
BELL: We've already
put him under a microscope.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.824
He donated big chunks
of his salary to charity,

04:31.870 --> 04:34.361
sings tenor in the Brooklyn
Gay Men's Choir.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.867
I'm not ruling anything out yet,

04:35.900 --> 04:38.630
but so far, Albright doesn't
strike me as a cannibal.

04:38.670 --> 04:40.001
Oh, he is a cannibal.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.678
But is he a witting one

04:41.710 --> 04:43.701
or an unwitting one?

04:43.750 --> 04:46.071
These are the contents
of his stomach.

04:46.110 --> 04:47.816
Sausage casings and all.

04:47.850 --> 04:49.886
(sniffs deeply)

04:49.920 --> 04:51.342
(gagging)

04:51.390 --> 04:52.880
Are you okay?

04:55.490 --> 04:58.379
The trick is to suppress
the gag reflex.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.318
It was an illuminating whiff.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.362
I'm sensing strong notes of

05:03.400 --> 05:04.697
anise-- you might recall...

05:04.730 --> 05:06.595
WATSON: Oh, yeah,
we traced all the major

05:06.640 --> 05:08.335
buyers of anise in the city

05:08.370 --> 05:10.031
when we were looking
into what's his name?

05:10.070 --> 05:11.401
Musgrave.

05:11.440 --> 05:14.375
As it happens...
(pants)

05:14.410 --> 05:15.877
there is one such
consumer who seems

05:15.910 --> 05:18.299
of particular interest
mmsmm.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.115
MAN:
Sorry, I'm confused.

05:23.150 --> 05:26.039
You think I sold a sausage
with a person in it?

05:26.090 --> 05:28.411
Anise is your trademark
ingredient, is it not?

05:28.460 --> 05:31.122
Yeah, but my meat comes
from cruelty-free sources.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.720
Meat which you then
grind on the premises,

05:33.760 --> 05:35.421
if your sign outside
is to be believed.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.893
Of course it is.

05:36.930 --> 05:39.967
Wait, you think
I ground somebody up?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.137
That's crazy.

05:41.170 --> 05:43.138
Do you have any proof?

05:43.170 --> 05:45.661
Other than the smell of anise
in a dead guy's stomach?

05:45.710 --> 05:47.905
No, but we would like
to investigate.

05:47.940 --> 05:49.669
Nothing happened
in my shop.

05:49.710 --> 05:51.974
Does anyone else have
access to this place?

05:52.010 --> 05:53.614
Employees with keys?

05:53.650 --> 05:56.141
I open and close the place
myself every day.

05:56.180 --> 05:59.650
We did have
a break-in last week.

05:59.690 --> 06:03.148
Somebody snapped the padlock
off the storm doors outside.

06:03.190 --> 06:05.522
They never got
upstairs, though.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.494
I keep a deadbolt
on the basement doors.

06:07.530 --> 06:09.623
The grinder's downstairs,
isn't it?

06:11.700 --> 06:14.931
Okay, so someone killed the man

06:14.970 --> 06:16.403
who Efraim Albright ate.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.704
Or woman.

06:18.740 --> 06:20.173
The victim could as easily
been female.

06:20.210 --> 06:22.576
Fine, the cannibal was
equal-opportunity.

06:22.610 --> 06:24.703
Whoever the victim was,
he, or she,

06:24.750 --> 06:25.944
was killed, dragged here,

06:25.980 --> 06:26.947
dropped into the basement,

06:26.980 --> 06:28.447
and then ground up?

06:28.480 --> 06:30.186
That's more or less
my theory, yes.

06:30.220 --> 06:31.915
And this is all based
on the fact that

06:31.950 --> 06:35.886
you smelled anise
in Albright's stomach?

06:35.920 --> 06:37.581
It's pretty thin,
don't you think?

06:37.630 --> 06:40.622
I think that a unique
set of circumstances

06:40.660 --> 06:42.696
calls for a flexible intellect

06:42.730 --> 06:44.163
to act as interpreter.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.622
Well, I-I assume

06:45.670 --> 06:46.932
we're gonna have
to make our way

06:46.970 --> 06:47.959
to that meat grinder,

06:48.000 --> 06:48.967
eventually.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.706
Yeah.

06:50.740 --> 06:51.934
You know, it's been
a while since

06:51.970 --> 06:53.198
we talked about your recovery.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.798
I mean, we used to talk
about it all the time,

06:54.840 --> 06:56.501
and now it's just
something you do.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.142
Well, we used to talk
about it all the time

06:58.180 --> 07:00.068
because you were
my sober companion.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.519
And now we're partners

07:01.550 --> 07:03.916
in the consulting detective
concern.

07:05.220 --> 07:07.017
We're also friends.
It wouldn't be so weird

07:07.060 --> 07:09.984
if we checked in with
each other once in a while.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.624
My recovery's part
of my routine.

07:12.660 --> 07:14.059
I don't discuss it with you
any more than

07:14.100 --> 07:15.192
I discuss my, uh...

07:15.230 --> 07:16.766
inhalations.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.567
Wait...

07:20.240 --> 07:22.162
What, did you find something?

07:22.200 --> 07:24.566
That's skin
and hair.

07:24.610 --> 07:28.068
That is less than
ten days old.

07:28.110 --> 07:30.078
So if someone

07:30.110 --> 07:32.249
unconscious, or barely conscious
was dragged down here,

07:32.280 --> 07:34.544
they might have banged their
head and left this behind.

07:35.850 --> 07:38.683
Both skin and hair are entirely
without pigment.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.711
Yet both are

07:40.760 --> 07:43.058
robust and springy.

07:43.090 --> 07:45.650
So whoever left this behind
wasn't old.

07:45.690 --> 07:47.226
You think he was an albino?

07:47.260 --> 07:48.818
Or she.

07:48.860 --> 07:52.261
Albinism is equally common
between both sexes.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.689
I think we should call Marcus.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.662
The parameters of
our missing persons search

07:56.710 --> 07:58.735
may just have narrowed
considerably.

08:13.020 --> 08:13.987
Watson.

08:14.020 --> 08:15.783
Hmm?

08:15.820 --> 08:16.980
It's morning.
You fell, you fell asleep.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.520
Mm, yeah.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.255
Ijust, uh...

08:20.300 --> 08:23.963
I know that Benson Durant
did not maintain

08:24.000 --> 08:25.524
his security cameras
outside his meat shop.

08:25.570 --> 08:26.867
They were all down.

08:26.900 --> 08:29.289
But I noticed there were
shops on either side

08:29.340 --> 08:31.262
that had working cameras,
so I called them

08:31.310 --> 08:32.675
and asked them
to send me footage.

08:32.710 --> 08:34.109
And you checked for albinos?

08:34.140 --> 08:35.573
Well, until I fell asleep.

08:35.610 --> 08:36.941
I didn't find anything.
I did.

08:36.980 --> 08:39.005
I've been up here
for 40 minutes looking

08:39.050 --> 08:40.779
at the footage you procured.

08:40.820 --> 08:42.708
Alas, no albinos.

08:42.750 --> 08:45.139
However, protestors
had begun to frequent

08:45.190 --> 08:46.987
the meat shop we
visited yesterday.

08:47.020 --> 08:48.556
Apparently, its owner,
Mr. Durant,

08:48.590 --> 08:49.955
had been giving a few lessons

08:49.990 --> 08:51.548
on how to butcher your own meat,

08:51.590 --> 08:52.852
and that attracted the attention

08:52.900 --> 08:54.595
of the animal rights movement.

08:54.630 --> 08:56.598
None of the protestors
suffered from albinism,

08:56.630 --> 08:57.665
however...

08:59.900 --> 09:01.561
That guy has vitiligo.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.136
Yeah, we're not
looking for an albino.

09:03.170 --> 09:04.967
We're looking for
this fellow here.

09:05.010 --> 09:06.898
And who is he?
Got no idea.

09:06.940 --> 09:09.909
The woman he's having a heated
discussion with, however,

09:09.950 --> 09:12.271
that's_a nurse at
MountVIew Hospital

09:12.310 --> 09:14.346
in Bayside.
I see the scrubs,

09:14.380 --> 09:16.348
but there's no way
to read the ID. tag

09:16.380 --> 09:18.587
from this angle.
Don't need to read it.

09:18.620 --> 09:19.917
It's orange.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.951
Mountview Hospital
is the only hospital

09:21.990 --> 09:24.823
in the five boroughs that has
orange identification badges.

09:24.860 --> 09:26.589
I sent a still
from this to Marcus,

09:26.630 --> 09:28.621
and he's trying to see
if she works there.

09:28.660 --> 09:30.298
While he's doing that,
I'm going to go out.

09:30.330 --> 09:31.365
You should wait for his call.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.288
Are you going to St. Olaf's.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.295
I find it best to tick
that particular box

09:34.340 --> 09:35.830
first thing in the morning.

09:35.870 --> 09:38.668
Quick bite to eat,
and then I'm gone.

09:44.180 --> 09:46.148
(dog barking in distance)

09:56.830 --> 09:59.128

10:06.670 --> 10:08.661

10:12.240 --> 10:13.707

10:37.770 --> 10:39.226
£3;ng {22’
aging/ask:
@ 5‘
£562,253?

10:39.270 --> 10:41.795
I sent a message to Sherlock,
too-- he coming?

10:41.840 --> 10:43.705
Yeah, he'll be along
after he checks his phone.

10:43.740 --> 10:44.661
We can get started.

10:44.710 --> 10:47.372
So, the guy we think wound up
in that sausage

10:47.410 --> 10:50.402
was arguing with a woman
named Alma Cabrera.

10:50.450 --> 10:53.214
She's a nurse in the oncology
department at Mountview.

10:56.180 --> 10:57.386
WOMAN:
Sure.

10:57.420 --> 10:58.739
That's Joaq.

10:58.790 --> 11:00.155
Joaq?

11:00.190 --> 11:02.385
Joaquin Pereya.

11:02.420 --> 11:04.729
He's a great guy,
we hang out sometimes.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.125
Kind of an off and on thing.

11:06.160 --> 11:09.391
Have you seen him
in the past week or so?

11:09.430 --> 11:12.228
No, but that's not unusual.

11:12.270 --> 11:14.397
He gets really caught up
in his work.

11:14.440 --> 11:15.964
Is everything okay?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.264
Do you have anything
of Mr. Pereya's here?

11:18.310 --> 11:21.802
Toothbrush, comb, anything
that might have a DNA sample

11:21.840 --> 11:23.068
on it?

11:23.110 --> 11:24.748
"DNA sample"?

11:24.780 --> 11:25.974
What happened to Joaq?

11:26.010 --> 11:29.013
We're not sure yet.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.784
They finally got him,
didn't they?

11:32.820 --> 11:34.481
Who are "they"?

11:34.520 --> 11:37.250
Joaquin was a biotechnologist.

11:37.290 --> 11:38.848
He_ called himself
a tissue engineer.

11:38.890 --> 11:42.291
If you listen
to his colleagues,

11:42.330 --> 11:45.322
he was a genius, his work
was gonna change everything.

11:46.370 --> 11:47.860
If Joaquin is really gone

11:47.900 --> 11:50.437
and you want to know
what happened,

11:50.470 --> 11:51.903
I'd start right here.

11:54.910 --> 11:57.003
I'm not exactly sure
what you're talking about,

11:57.050 --> 11:59.348
but I really hope
that didn't used to be a person.

12:07.890 --> 12:09.414
BELL:
So it isn't actually meat,

12:09.460 --> 12:12.054
it's some kind of fake meat?

12:12.090 --> 12:13.523
No, it's actually meat.

12:13.560 --> 12:14.959
It's 100% American beef.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.228
We just...

12:16.260 --> 12:17.329
grow it here in the lab

12:17.370 --> 12:19.224
instead of on a cow.

12:19.270 --> 12:23.058
You do see how those
ideas don't go together.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.931
Well, muscle is
made of cells, right?

12:25.970 --> 12:28.404
We harvest those cells humanely
from living animals

12:28.440 --> 12:30.078
and replicate them here.

12:30.110 --> 12:31.509
HOLMES:
Obviating barbaric industry

12:31.550 --> 12:33.973
practices, animal slaughter,

12:34.020 --> 12:36.818
_ and._..
climate-destroying methane.

12:36.850 --> 12:37.680
Well, that is our hope.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.280
Big Meat must be quaking
in their boots.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.151
"Big Meat"?

12:42.190 --> 12:45.956
The cattle industry at large.

12:45.990 --> 12:47.992
May I?
Mm.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.967
(sniffs)

13:02.440 --> 13:04.840
It's a bit antiseptic.

13:06.110 --> 13:07.919
We're still perfecting texture.

13:07.950 --> 13:09.440
Fat to protein ratio.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.084
And what the cell's grown in,

13:11.120 --> 13:14.055
that must affect
the flavor as well, yeah?

13:14.090 --> 13:16.923
It's a solution of amino acids,
mineral supplements.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.928
Mostly sugar.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.188
So, it's what a cow
would taste like

13:20.230 --> 13:21.822
if it was raised on, um...

13:21.860 --> 13:23.088
breakfast cereal.

13:25.130 --> 13:27.064
It's a work in progress.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.489
And Joaquin Pereya's
role in all this?

13:29.540 --> 13:33.431
(cell phone buzzes)

13:33.480 --> 13:35.471
(phone clicks)

13:35.510 --> 13:37.239
(typing on phone)

13:37.280 --> 13:39.544
We haven't told
the rest of the team

13:39.580 --> 13:41.241
that he might be dead.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.443
I... I still can't
believe it myself.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.414
He is dead, I just got a message
from the forensic lab.

13:47.460 --> 13:50.054
The DNA that we found
was Mr. Pereya's.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.523
Sorry.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.448
Well, we'll gather everyone
this afternoon

13:53.500 --> 13:55.525
and let them know.

13:55.560 --> 14:00.236
Now, Brendan knows that
something might be up.

14:00.270 --> 14:02.864
He was second in_
command to Joaqum.

14:02.910 --> 14:08.371
He stepped up when we thought
that Joaquin had... flaked.

14:08.410 --> 14:11.379
This was his desk.

14:11.410 --> 14:13.947
Joaquin was our
lead bioengineer.

14:13.980 --> 14:15.174
He was a genius.

14:15.220 --> 14:17.188
He, uh, worked out
most of the science

14:17.220 --> 14:18.448
that made this possible.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.549
Our Mozart of Meat.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.454
BELL:
So,gwﬁnend,

14:23.490 --> 14:25.549
Alma, may have been
on to something.

14:25.590 --> 14:28.525
If someone wanted to hurt
their chances of succeeding,

14:28.560 --> 14:30.494
killing Joaquin was
a good place to start.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.038
That lady in the white coat,

14:34.070 --> 14:36.129
does she have any
reason to use this desk?

14:36.170 --> 14:37.467
Corrine? No.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.932
Why?

14:42.580 --> 14:46.004
Corrine, this is Detective Bell

14:46.050 --> 14:48.245
and his consultant,
Mr. Holmes.

14:48.280 --> 14:49.611
We just re-checked
your references.

14:49.650 --> 14:51.049
Care to explain

14:51.090 --> 14:52.239
why the phone numbers you gave

14:52.290 --> 14:53.257
for your last two employers

14:53.290 --> 14:54.484
are now disconnected?

14:54.520 --> 14:56.158
Excuse me?

14:56.190 --> 14:58.385
I could explain.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.398
Your recent work history's
a fiction.

15:00.430 --> 15:01.397
You're a spy sent here

15:01.430 --> 15:03.523
to gather intelligence
on Next Century Meats'

15:03.570 --> 15:05.993
linchpin scientist,
Joaquin Pereya.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.497
But Werner, I have no idea

15:07.540 --> 15:09.064
why the numbers aren't working.

15:09.100 --> 15:10.601
HOLMES:
Your shoes, Ms. Brighton,

15:10.640 --> 15:13.404
are the creation of celebrated
French deSIgner,

15:13.440 --> 15:15.078
Christian Louboutin.
Yes.

15:15.110 --> 15:16.532
And?
Early in his career,

15:16.580 --> 15:18.969
Monsieur Louboutin,
in a fit of artistic peak,

15:19.010 --> 15:22.116
used red nail polish to lacquer
the soles of his shoes.

15:22.150 --> 15:24.448
And that's been a trademark
of the brand ever since, yeah.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.981
Unfortunately for you,
the soles scuff,

15:27.020 --> 15:28.487
so I quite literally followed
your footprints

15:28.520 --> 15:29.953
over to Mr. Pereya's workstation

15:29.990 --> 15:31.981
where, judging by
the copious scuffage,

15:32.030 --> 15:33.452
you've been a very busy bee.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.297
BELL:
Whoever placed you here,

15:35.330 --> 15:36.991
might've had
Joaquin Pereya murdered.

15:37.030 --> 15:39.669
So unless you killed him
yourself,

15:39.700 --> 15:41.634
you'd be smart to
get in front of this.

15:41.670 --> 15:43.206
Wait.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.559
Joaquin is dead?

15:47.240 --> 15:49.674
I was placed here
by Midwest Cattle Ranchers.

15:49.710 --> 15:51.507
Oh, my God.

15:51.550 --> 15:53.415
They just said I was supposed
to share information.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.138
I never signed on for murder.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.543
I don't know much.

15:58.590 --> 16:00.319
But I'll help you ifI can.

16:07.460 --> 16:10.429
Any smoking guns from
Ms. Brighton's communiqus

16:10.470 --> 16:12.097
with Big Meat?

16:12.130 --> 16:13.597
You really love
saying that, don't you?

16:13.640 --> 16:17.235
Yeah, more than I enjoy saying
"Midwest Cattle Ranchers."

16:17.270 --> 16:18.737
Well, not yet, aanay.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.635
Plenty on what we already know.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.534
They faked her job history,
they set her up to spy on

16:22.580 --> 16:26.471
Joaquin Pereya, but so far no
e-mails saying "Great work.

16:26.510 --> 16:28.410
We're gonna kill him,
we'll take it from here."

16:28.450 --> 16:30.213
You going out?

16:30.250 --> 16:33.151
While you were perusing, uh,
Ms. Brighton's correspondence,

16:33.190 --> 16:35.215
I was nosing about
Midwest Cattle's computers,

16:35.260 --> 16:36.557
and I hit a firewall
I couldn't crack,

16:36.590 --> 16:37.579
so I asked Everyone for help.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.121
Their task du jour
is that I deliver

16:40.160 --> 16:42.321
five minutes
of observational comedy

16:42.360 --> 16:45.124
at open mic night at a place
called The Joke Hole.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.467
I'd invite you to come,

16:46.500 --> 16:48.138
but my plan is to stink.

16:48.170 --> 16:50.764
Oh, uh, your friend Holder
came by yesterday.

16:53.310 --> 16:54.675
He wanted me to give you this.

17:02.620 --> 17:06.488
Doesn't really go
with anything I own.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.715
Yeah, I told him the same thing.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.323
So I take it he informed you
I've not been going

17:16.360 --> 17:17.668
_ to St. Olaf's
in qUIte some time.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.224
The man needs a lesson
in the meaning

17:19.270 --> 17:21.238
of anonymity.

17:21.270 --> 17:24.205
He said that you
needed a change.

17:24.240 --> 17:25.559
That you're going
to a different meeting.

17:25.610 --> 17:27.237
Is that what's going on?

17:27.280 --> 17:29.339
Well, you followed me
to Van Kirk Park this morning,

17:29.380 --> 17:31.848
so... I'm sure you know

17:31.880 --> 17:33.677
that it isn't.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.848
I'm well versed in the art of
detecting a tail, Watson.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.610
Yeah, I probably should not
have done that.

17:39.650 --> 17:41.789
Well, I probably shouldn't
have lied.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.722
So let's put an an end to it,
shall we?

17:44.760 --> 17:47.354
The change that
I needed to instate

17:47.400 --> 17:49.459
is that I'm not going
to meetings anymore.

17:49.500 --> 17:50.728
Why?

17:50.770 --> 17:53.193
I needed to inject
an element of derring-do

17:53.240 --> 17:54.593
into my sobriety.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.631
Remove the safety net,
if you will.

17:56.670 --> 17:58.809
And you, even if no longer
in an official capacity,

17:58.840 --> 18:00.728
are part of that safety net,
so I kept you out of the loop.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.408
The daily business

18:03.450 --> 18:04.769
of staying sober,
of going to meetings

18:04.810 --> 18:06.471
with people not nearly
my intellectual equal,

18:06.510 --> 18:07.716
has become a bore.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.479
I've said before

18:09.520 --> 18:11.317
my mind rebels at stagnation.

18:11.350 --> 18:13.659
The process of recovery
has become stagnant,

18:13.690 --> 18:15.783
so I've increased
the level of difficulty,

18:15.820 --> 18:17.378
in order to remain engaged.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.648
What I have not done,
I assure you,

18:19.690 --> 18:22.818
is waiver in my commitment
one iota.

18:24.230 --> 18:25.720
You're arrogant.

18:25.770 --> 18:27.533
I beg your pardon?

18:27.570 --> 18:29.390
Your problem is that
you think you're smarter

18:29.440 --> 18:30.668
than everyone else.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.860
I am smarter than everyone else,
demonstrably.

18:32.910 --> 18:34.707
I didn't say
you weren't, you are.

18:34.740 --> 18:36.378
I said you think you are,
you think

18:36.410 --> 18:37.877
that being smarter
makes you different.

18:37.910 --> 18:40.845
Don't you think other people
get bored at meetings, too?

18:40.880 --> 18:43.144
It-it was one of the most common
things I used to talk about

18:43.190 --> 18:44.384
with my clients.

18:44.420 --> 18:46.684
Everyone gets bored at meetings.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.553
It doesn't make you
different, it makes you typical.

18:49.590 --> 18:52.184
But you know what the ones
who stay sober do?

18:52.230 --> 18:53.527
They keep going to meetings.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.391
Have you considered
the possibility

18:55.430 --> 18:57.227
that I experience
my boredom more acutely

18:57.270 --> 18:58.726
than others experience theirs?

18:58.770 --> 19:00.567
I've been relating to my
sobriety like a tourist

19:00.600 --> 19:02.192
who visits the Grand Canyon.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.800
But doesn't go near the edge
for fear of falling in.

19:04.840 --> 19:07.172
Yes, and that's how
you stay sober.

19:07.210 --> 19:10.441
It is also how you lull yourself
into a torpor.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.175
If addiction is an abyss,

19:12.210 --> 19:15.247
shouldn't the addict tiptoe
up to the edge once and a while?

19:15.280 --> 19:16.941
Stare down into the gorge.

19:16.980 --> 19:18.641
You know what?

19:18.690 --> 19:19.884
The first thing you said
was right.

19:21.390 --> 19:23.585
I'm not officially anything
to your sobriety

19:23.630 --> 19:24.858
other than your friend.

19:26.660 --> 19:28.321
You have the right to do
whatever you want.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.363
My vote is sober and bored.

19:34.870 --> 19:36.792
You know what?
Uh, there's another...

19:36.840 --> 19:37.932
box of Corrin_e's files
downstairs,

19:37.970 --> 19:39.369
I'm gonna go through it.

19:39.410 --> 19:40.536
You got to your open mic,

19:40.580 --> 19:42.730
I'm sure you'll kill.

19:59.330 --> 20:01.548
HOLMES:
Two breakfast sandwiches.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.818
One made with sausage
from our own larder.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.792
The other was concocted
from "shmeat,"

20:05.830 --> 20:09.869
which I brought home
from Next Century Meats.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.902
*

20:11.940 --> 20:13.532
"Shmeat"?

20:13.580 --> 20:15.798
A term of art among
scientists in the field,

20:15.840 --> 20:18.604
a "sheet of meat."

20:20.380 --> 20:23.417
You're not interested in
the blind taste test I devised?

20:23.450 --> 20:25.748
No offense. I appreciate
the gesture,

20:25.790 --> 20:27.781
or part of it, but...

20:27.820 --> 20:30.015
I'm gonna pass
on the lab-grown meat thing.

20:30.060 --> 20:32.381
If you wanted a skin graft,
you'd prefer cells grown

20:32.430 --> 20:34.557
in a lab over ones
from a cadaver, no?

20:34.600 --> 20:36.921
Why should what you put in
your mouth be any different?

20:36.960 --> 20:38.894
'Cause I don't eat
my own skin.

20:38.930 --> 20:40.830
I'm surprised. You're
a woman of science.

20:40.870 --> 20:44.533
Yeah. And I've been
around plenty of labs.

20:44.570 --> 20:47.903
It's not a place where you want
to go shop for groceries.

20:47.940 --> 20:50.773
Have you ever been around
an industrial slaughterhouse?

20:50.810 --> 20:52.448
(inhales)

20:52.480 --> 20:54.539
How'd your comedy set go?

20:54.580 --> 20:55.877
Oh, wonderfully. Boos abounded.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.285
A gentleman backstage told me

20:57.320 --> 20:58.947
I needed to be more relatable.

20:58.990 --> 21:00.617
The access

21:00.660 --> 21:02.412
I was granted
by Everyone, however,

21:02.460 --> 21:03.882
proved much more fruitful.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.956
According to Big Meat's
accounting records,

21:06.990 --> 21:08.821
they recently paid $100,000

21:08.860 --> 21:11.897
to a "performance consultant"
named Thomas Cockburn.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.991
Mm... What's
a "performance consultant"?

21:16.040 --> 21:18.964
I have no idea. And I'd bet
no one at Big Meat does either.

21:19.010 --> 21:21.478
Did a little digging
into Thomas Cockburn.

21:21.510 --> 21:24.308
He's attracted the attention
of both federal

21:24.350 --> 21:25.942
_ and local authorities
in multiple jurisdictions

21:25.980 --> 21:27.675
over the last six years,
in connection

21:27.720 --> 21:29.813
with eight other murders.

21:29.850 --> 21:32.819
In each case, a company with
reason to want the victim dead

21:32.850 --> 21:34.681
paid Cockburn as a
consultant around the same time.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.517
So, he's a corporate hit man.

21:36.560 --> 21:37.857
That is what
the authorities believed,

21:37.890 --> 21:39.619
but they were never
able to prove it.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.027
for each of the murders,
showing that he was in

21:43.060 --> 21:45.369
an entirely different city at
the times they were committed.

21:45.400 --> 21:46.992
But?

21:47.030 --> 21:49.897
But I noticed something
the authorities missed.

21:49.940 --> 21:52.465
Cockburn has an adult daughter,
named Grace.

21:52.510 --> 21:54.501
The two are ostensibly estranged

21:54.540 --> 21:56.974
after Cockburn's divorce
from her mother.

21:57.010 --> 21:58.568
It's why she
was never considered,

21:58.610 --> 22:00.919
but I think they're much closer
than they let on.

22:03.390 --> 22:05.119
So, she's been in each city

22:05.150 --> 22:07.755
when a murder happened.
You think they're partners.

22:07.790 --> 22:09.382
Grace happens to live
in New York.

22:09.420 --> 22:11.581
Marcus is inviting her
to the station as we speak.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.757
So, make yourself
an alternate breakfast.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.495
We should have
Joaquin Pereya's murder solved

22:15.530 --> 22:17.623
by the time you get dressed.

22:20.030 --> 22:21.759
BELL:
We get that you never
expected anyone

22:21.800 --> 22:24.007
to connect you to these
murders, but...

22:24.040 --> 22:25.837
it still would have
been a good idea

22:25.870 --> 22:27.633
not to keep so much evidence

22:27.680 --> 22:28.931
in your apartment.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.948
Our search turned up
building plans,

22:30.980 --> 22:32.948
travel receipts
and this coded log book

22:32.980 --> 22:35.949
that Mr. Holmes here
cracked in no time.

22:35.980 --> 22:38.642
I mean, it's really quite
easy to break a cipher

22:38.690 --> 22:39.941
if you know what
it's going to say.

22:39.990 --> 22:43.756
Feds are picking up
your dad in Miami,

22:43.790 --> 22:44.927
and a whole bunch of
other Cities are gonna

22:44.960 --> 22:46.757
want to talk to you,
but we get you first.

22:46.790 --> 22:49.429
And our DA. is gonna want
to close this quick,

22:49.460 --> 22:52.122
before the FBI
takes over. So...

22:52.170 --> 22:55.037
help us wrap up
Joaquin Pereya,

22:55.070 --> 22:56.935
and you're in a strong
position to make a deal.

22:56.970 --> 23:00.030
I would, honestly.

23:00.070 --> 23:02.630
Except I didn't kill
Joaquin Pereya.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.705
HOLMES: Is there a point
in denying it now?

23:04.750 --> 23:06.103
We have evidence
that you killed nine people.

23:06.150 --> 23:07.071
The game's lost.

23:07.110 --> 23:09.749
You have proof
that we killed eight people.

23:09.780 --> 23:12.681
My father and I had nothing
to do with Pereya's death.

23:12.720 --> 23:13.709
You had his info

23:13.760 --> 23:14.909
in your apartment.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.019
Records that you
were tailing him.

23:17.060 --> 23:19.688
Because Midwest Cattle Ranchers
did hire us to kill him.

23:19.730 --> 23:22.051
We had a plan. We were ready
to go through with it.

23:22.100 --> 23:26.025
But MCR canceled the contract
before we did the job.

23:26.070 --> 23:28.732
Why would they do that?

23:28.770 --> 23:31.898
An FDA ruling came down, about
the food Pereya was developing.

23:31.940 --> 23:34.101
The government classified it
as "meat substitute,"

23:34.140 --> 23:37.109
instead of recognizing it
as meat.

23:37.140 --> 23:39.779
So, Next Century Meats'
product will be relegated

23:39.810 --> 23:41.641
to the tofu aisle,

23:41.680 --> 23:45.081
along with veggie burgers,
and other fringe foodstuffs.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.747
So, Midwest Cattle's panic

23:46.790 --> 23:49.953
went from five-alarm fire
to a minor annoyance.

23:49.990 --> 23:52.788
They didn't need to kill him
anymore, so they called us off.

23:52.830 --> 23:55.151
Why would I bother lying?

23:55.200 --> 23:58.169
You're right that I am screwed
when the Feds get here.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.622
But we didn't kill your guy.

24:01.000 --> 24:01.637
Someone else did.

24:01.670 --> 24:02.864
*

24:10.550 --> 24:12.040
(door opens)

24:12.080 --> 24:13.809
GREGSON: I understand
congrats are in order.

24:13.850 --> 24:16.546
You picked up a team of hit men
that the FBI's been hunting

24:16.580 --> 24:18.081
for years?
Unfortunately,

24:18.120 --> 24:20.213
neither one of them
killed Joaquin Pereya.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.650
Well, Holmes texted me.

24:22.690 --> 24:25.727
"Big Meat innocent.
Further suspects to come."

24:25.760 --> 24:27.022
"Further suspects."

24:27.060 --> 24:28.493
I guess that's
what you're doing?

24:28.530 --> 24:30.191
The people Pereya
worked with?

24:30.230 --> 24:32.198
They called him
the Mozart of Meat.

24:32.230 --> 24:34.937
Sherlock says he knows a
little something about genius,

24:34.970 --> 24:36.494
and that... _
"No truly exceptional intellect

24:36.540 --> 24:39.737
would knowingly submit
flawed work."

24:39.770 --> 24:41.579
Now, the FDA
has consistently ruled

24:41.610 --> 24:43.703
that if two products are
genetically identical,

24:43.750 --> 24:45.900
then they're legally
the same thing.

24:45.950 --> 24:47.713
Even if one's natural and

24:47.750 --> 24:49.047
one's grown in a lab.

24:49.080 --> 24:51.219
Now, Pereya obviously knew that.

24:51.250 --> 24:52.842
So, Sherlock thinks
there's no way

24:52.890 --> 24:54.915
he would've submitted
bad research to the FDA.

24:54.960 --> 24:56.757
So, he went
to Next Century Meats,

24:56.790 --> 25:00.055
and got them to give us
Pereya's undoctored research.

25:00.090 --> 25:02.092
And you're comparing it
to the work

25:02.130 --> 25:04.223
that was submitted to the FDA.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.124
You think someone
doctored Pereya's work?

25:06.170 --> 25:07.194
Sherlock does.

25:07.230 --> 25:08.595
I'm agnostic.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.130
But right now I'm along
for the ride.

25:13.340 --> 25:15.171
Oh!
What?

25:15.210 --> 25:19.146
This chart in the official
report. It looks identical

25:19.180 --> 25:21.671
to the one in
Pereya's research, except...

25:21.720 --> 25:24.188
couple numbers are different.

25:24.220 --> 25:27.144
I'm sending pictures
off to Sherlock.

25:27.190 --> 25:29.181
I'm sure it'll be a minute
before I hear back.

25:29.220 --> 25:30.858
If you've got stuff to do...

25:30.890 --> 25:31.857
Hmm.

25:31.890 --> 25:32.982
(beeps)

25:33.030 --> 25:34.554
That's him.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.556
"Get here immediately."

25:36.600 --> 25:37.965
He used an eight to make it

25:38.000 --> 25:39.194
easier to type out
"immediately."

25:39.230 --> 25:41.164
"Our so-called 'Mozart of Meat'

25:41.200 --> 25:42.758
had his very own Salieri."

25:44.940 --> 25:47.807
Mr. Farley, you were
Mr. Pereya's understudy.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.307
If his work failed

25:49.340 --> 25:51.171
and then he disappeared
in disgrace,

25:51.210 --> 25:54.111
n-no one stood to benefit
more than you.

25:54.150 --> 25:57.813
Whoa, Joaq was my boss,
but he was also my friend.

25:57.850 --> 26:00.216
I hope you're not suggesting
I killed him.

26:00.250 --> 26:01.683
BELL:
We know someone sabotaged

26:01.720 --> 26:03.153
the data, Mr. Farley.

26:03.190 --> 26:05.078
You had access to Joaquin
Pereya's computer

26:05.130 --> 26:07.155
and you have the technical
expertise alter his work.

26:07.190 --> 26:10.125
We'll prove that, 'cause we've
already been granted access

26:10.160 --> 26:12.890
to Pereya's hard drives.
Your digital fingerprints

26:12.930 --> 26:14.261
are in there somewhere.

26:14.300 --> 26:16.291
It's the only explanation
that makes any sense.

26:16.340 --> 26:18.900
Theoretically speaking,

26:18.940 --> 26:20.976
let's say you find
the guy who fudged

26:21.010 --> 26:22.272
Joaq's research.
That doesn't mean

26:22.310 --> 26:23.902
you found the guy
who killed him.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.201
Is that a theoretical
admi55ion

26:25.250 --> 26:26.899
to being the saboteur?

26:26.950 --> 26:29.111
You guys have got messing around
with Joaq's numbers

26:29.150 --> 26:30.276
all tied up with killing him.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.140
One's a try at getting

26:32.190 --> 26:34.317
a leg up in the office.
The other's life in prison.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.681
It wasn't necessarily
the same person.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.029
So, convince us
they're not tied together.

26:39.060 --> 26:40.823
Okay, look.

26:40.860 --> 26:43.124
You dig around enough,
you're gonna see,

26:43.160 --> 26:46.789
it was me who fudged the data.
I'm not proud of it,

26:46.830 --> 26:49.697
and I hope you don't tell
my boss and ruin my career.

26:49.740 --> 26:52.004
But Mr. Platz called your office

26:52.040 --> 26:53.928
to learn what he could
about Joaq's murder.

26:53.980 --> 26:56.005
Apparently, he was killed
between Wednesday and Friday

26:56.040 --> 26:57.200
of last week?

26:57.240 --> 26:58.673
That's what we think, yeah.

26:58.710 --> 27:01.144
I was at a wedding
in Curacao last week.

27:01.180 --> 27:03.819
Left Monday, landed at JFK
middle of the day Friday.

27:03.850 --> 27:07.115
I'm telling the truth!
I was at the ceremony!

27:07.150 --> 27:08.981
You can ask
the bridesmaids I hit on.

27:13.290 --> 27:15.190
It's as we suspected.

27:15.230 --> 27:18.722
Brendan Farley's three-quarter
alibi is 100% percent true.

27:18.770 --> 27:21.091
He was harassing
bridesmaids in Curacao.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.802
So, it wasn't him.

27:23.840 --> 27:26.365
Who else wanted Joaquin Pereya
dead because he made

27:26.410 --> 27:29.231
a lucrative breakthrough
in the field of cultured meat?

27:29.280 --> 27:31.248
Well, I'm already going through
the company reports

27:31.280 --> 27:32.406
for Next Century Meats.

27:35.250 --> 27:37.218
I think you're bored
with recovery

27:37.250 --> 27:39.286
because you're not
saying what's on your mind.

27:40.790 --> 27:43.088
What's on my mind
is that I'm bored.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.054
And that's exactly what you need
to be talking about.

27:45.090 --> 27:46.955
That, and everything else
you said yesterday.

27:46.990 --> 27:49.299
Including the bit about being
the smartest person in the room?

27:49.330 --> 27:51.969
See, recovery only works
if you say what you're thinking.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.228
Those people in the room,
whatever their I.Q. is,

27:53.270 --> 27:54.237
they've been through a lot.

27:54.270 --> 27:56.363
They can handle you being
an arrogant jerk.

27:56.400 --> 27:57.389
I mean, will it be awloNard?

27:57.440 --> 27:59.067
Probably, but when's that

27:59.110 --> 28:00.259
ever stopped you?

28:02.310 --> 28:04.904
It's a better way to re-engage.

28:04.950 --> 28:08.010
I worked with a lot
of clients before, and...

28:08.050 --> 28:11.213
every time sometimes tries to go
it alone, it always ends badly.

28:12.790 --> 28:14.917
S...

28:14.960 --> 28:16.951
*

28:26.370 --> 28:28.361
*

28:32.370 --> 28:33.769
HOLMES:
Watson, you may want
to compose yourself

28:33.810 --> 28:35.835
before coming downstairs.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.474
A salon of sorts
is in progress.

28:38.510 --> 28:39.499
(man chuckles)

28:39.550 --> 28:42.747
It's so new!

28:42.780 --> 28:44.384
Aye, so true, so true.

28:44.420 --> 28:48.049
Now, we eat, uh, eggs, yes?

28:48.090 --> 28:50.251
These are cells
taken from an animal.

28:50.290 --> 28:52.884
The chicken is
presumably still alive.

28:52.930 --> 28:54.397
(laughter)

28:54.430 --> 28:56.796
That's an interesting example.
Mm-hmm.

28:56.830 --> 28:59.264
MAN:
Oh, good morning.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.800
Now, if we could only
find those chickens.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.467
(laughter)

29:05.510 --> 29:07.137
(laughter echoes)
(humming)

29:07.170 --> 29:09.001
WATSON:
Why is there some sort of

29:09.040 --> 29:11.440
world peace convocation
going on upstairs?

29:11.480 --> 29:13.846
Those are leading scholars
of their respective faiths.

29:13.880 --> 29:15.347
We've had a very
productive morning.

29:15.380 --> 29:17.314
We reached conclusions
on some knotty issues.

29:17.350 --> 29:19.386
And now it's time to eat.

29:19.420 --> 29:22.184
Jews and Muslims are united
by more than conflict, Watson.

29:22.220 --> 29:24.984
Both groups have labored
under dietary restrictions

29:25.030 --> 29:26.486
for millennia.

29:26.530 --> 29:28.521
Including very strict guidelines

29:28.560 --> 29:32.462
over the slaughter
and consumption of meat.

29:32.500 --> 29:34.331
Why would someone
doctor research

29:34.370 --> 29:36.031
to prevent
a lucrative breakthrough

29:36.070 --> 29:37.492
from being labeled as such?

29:37.540 --> 29:39.007
Only, I now believe,

29:39.040 --> 29:41.508
if it was more profitable
to have another label.

29:41.540 --> 29:43.508
Are you familiar
with the word pareve?

29:43.540 --> 29:45.849
Uh, it's a kosher thing, right?

29:45.880 --> 29:47.438
Mm. The laws of kashrut state

29:47.480 --> 29:49.471
that permissible foods
are divided into groups--

29:49.520 --> 29:50.885
dairy, meat.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.512
But there's a third
classification.

29:52.550 --> 29:55.212
Pareve. Water is pareve.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.251
Carrots are pareve.

29:57.290 --> 30:00.157
Okay, so pareve is like...
neutral?

30:00.190 --> 30:01.896
Exactly, it's the Switzerland
of food.

30:01.930 --> 30:05.388
Now, if shmeat is ruled
to be actual meat,

30:05.430 --> 30:08.558
that obviously opens up
the carnivore market,

30:08.600 --> 30:12.934
but it also subjects it to the
Gordian Knot of halal and kosher

30:12.970 --> 30:13.937
certification.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.402
If it is a mere meat substitute,

30:15.440 --> 30:18.341
then it sits, forlorn,
in the vegan aisle.

30:18.380 --> 30:20.917
But if shmeat can
thread the needle,

30:20.950 --> 30:23.510
if it can be actual
lab-grown meat,

30:23.550 --> 30:25.017
but not be classified
as such...

30:25.050 --> 30:26.415
It would be pareve,

30:26.450 --> 30:29.351
neutral to the kosher
and halal rules about meat.

30:29.390 --> 30:30.880
Imagine, Watson.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.420
Observant Jews
finally being allowed

30:32.460 --> 30:33.427
a cheeseburger.

30:33.460 --> 30:34.552
Religious Muslims indulging

30:34.600 --> 30:36.488
in pulled-pork Cubanos.

30:38.100 --> 30:40.261
Over a billion Muslims
in the world.

30:40.300 --> 30:42.234
It's a huge untapped market.

30:42.270 --> 30:43.532
Probably way more profitable

30:43.570 --> 30:45.299
for them to not label
shmeat as meat.

30:45.340 --> 30:48.229
Hence the doctored research.

30:48.280 --> 30:51.408
So, if Joaquin Pereya wasn't
on board for faking the data,

30:51.450 --> 30:52.439
that would mean
that whoever's

30:52.480 --> 30:54.038
in charge of that place

30:54.080 --> 30:55.547
would have reason to kill him.

30:55.580 --> 30:56.945
And that would be...

30:56.980 --> 31:01.087
Werner Platz,
CEO of Next Century Meats.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.280
Can we prove he was involved?

31:02.320 --> 31:04.049
We can if his coconspirator

31:04.090 --> 31:05.978
will talk to us.

31:08.530 --> 31:10.225
Mr. Farley,
thank you so much

31:10.260 --> 31:11.466
for coming on short notice.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.058
I thought I already
answered your questions.

31:13.100 --> 31:14.533
Well, we had one set
of questions for you

31:14.570 --> 31:16.959
when we thought that
you killed Joaquin Pereya.

31:17.000 --> 31:17.967
We no longer think that.

31:18.010 --> 31:20.160
Oh, okay.

31:20.210 --> 31:21.609
Good.
We now think

31:21.640 --> 31:23.505
that you were part of
a conspiracy to kill him.

31:23.540 --> 31:25.576
After you.

31:28.450 --> 31:30.077
BELL:
This is the intersection

31:30.120 --> 31:32.486
of 65th street and
Metropolitan Avenue.

31:32.520 --> 31:35.318
Street racers use this
stretch of Metropolitan.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.487
A concerned citizen
tried to catch

31:37.520 --> 31:39.385
_ some of their
license plates on camera.

31:39.430 --> 31:41.489
She overheard a
patrolman asking

31:41.530 --> 31:44.522
for security camera footage,
volunteered to share this.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.629
Am I supposed to be
looking at something?

31:46.670 --> 31:48.888
BELL: That's your boss,
Werner Platz.

31:49.740 --> 31:52.106
So?

31:52.140 --> 31:53.402
Mr. Farley,
that intersection

31:53.440 --> 31:54.998
is a half block away

31:55.040 --> 31:56.576
from Brooklyn's Best Wurst.

31:56.610 --> 31:58.544
This footage was gathered
the same night someone

31:58.580 --> 32:01.378
broke into the store
and ground Joaquin Pereya

32:01.420 --> 32:02.648
into so much mince.

32:02.680 --> 32:05.285
We can place your boss
right by the scene,

32:05.320 --> 32:06.719
on the night it happened.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.581
I've also had

32:08.620 --> 32:10.258
an informal peek
at your banking records.

32:10.290 --> 32:11.587
"Informal peek"?

32:11.630 --> 32:12.585
What does that mean?

32:12.630 --> 32:13.949
It means I have friends

32:14.000 --> 32:14.955
who are digitally nimble.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.353
Don't look at him.

32:16.400 --> 32:17.594
He had nothing to do with it.

32:17.630 --> 32:18.597
We'll get an authorized

32:18.630 --> 32:20.029
look soon enough.

32:20.070 --> 32:21.389
They'll show a judge
what we already know.

32:22.640 --> 32:23.664
Someone recently paid

32:23.700 --> 32:25.463
your mortgage in full.

32:25.510 --> 32:26.431
It was paid
by a third party.

32:26.470 --> 32:29.268
We're already trying
to link that to your boss.

32:29.310 --> 32:32.302
What does that have to do
with Joaquin?

32:32.350 --> 32:33.578
BELL: Werner
Platz wanted

32:33.610 --> 32:36.511
Mr. Pereya to alter
his... shmeat

32:36.550 --> 32:39.314
so the FDA would classify
it as a meat substitute.

32:39.350 --> 32:41.489
Then he could sell it
to the kosher and halal markets.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.488
WATSON:
But Pereya was
a true believer.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.681
_ He _cared more about
disrupting the meat industry

32:45.730 --> 32:47.357
than he did about the profits.

32:47.390 --> 32:48.755
He wouldn't make the change.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.654
So, Platz killed Pereya

32:50.700 --> 32:53.624
and found himself
a cringing mediocrity

32:53.670 --> 32:55.638
who would take a fee
to alter the data.

32:55.670 --> 32:58.332
And that was you, Mr. Farley.

32:58.370 --> 33:01.533
BELL: Testify against
Werner Platz.

33:01.580 --> 33:04.344
I already offered you one chance
to get in front of this.

33:04.380 --> 33:06.245
You won't get another.

33:07.280 --> 33:10.215
And if I say no, what happens?

33:10.250 --> 33:12.081
You take that
video to a judge.

33:12.120 --> 33:15.612
All that shows is Werner
driving down the street.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.116
Why'd he pay my mortgage?

33:17.160 --> 33:18.582
'Cause I'm a great employee

33:18.630 --> 33:21.121
and I just got a promotion.

33:21.160 --> 33:23.754
You guys have nothing on me

33:23.800 --> 33:25.768
and I'm pretty sure you've
got nothing on Werner

33:25.800 --> 33:28.291
or you wouldn't be trying
to get me to turn on him.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.637
It was a nice try, guys,

33:29.670 --> 33:31.729
but I'm going to leave
my lavwer's number.

33:31.770 --> 33:34.603
Don't call me again.

33:38.210 --> 33:41.748
So, Brendan Farley
and Werner Platz killed a man

33:41.780 --> 33:43.338
and ground him into sausage...

33:43.380 --> 33:45.416
and not only do
they get to walk free...

33:45.450 --> 33:48.180
They'll both be rich the moment
the shmeat hits the market.

33:48.220 --> 33:49.289
God bless America.

33:59.470 --> 34:00.266
We'll canvass the neighborhood

34:00.300 --> 34:02.461
near the meat shop
again tomorrow.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.434
Perhaps we missed someone
who saw Werner Platz

34:04.470 --> 34:06.301
carrying a body
down the stairs.

34:06.340 --> 34:09.229
The patrolman went
door to door twice.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.804
It's my party.
I'll clean up.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.308
You should rest.
You seem a little tense.

34:13.350 --> 34:15.341
I'm frustrated.

34:15.380 --> 34:17.769
Uh, we found the people
who broke into the Leviathan.

34:17.820 --> 34:19.481
We arrested half
of Le Milieu

34:19.520 --> 34:20.487
to get your brother
off the hook.

34:20.520 --> 34:22.181
We brought down Moriarty.

34:22.220 --> 34:23.619
I mean, these guys
are not criminal geniuses.

34:23.660 --> 34:25.548
They're just a couple of idiots
who killed for money.

34:25.590 --> 34:27.649
Granted, it's not
the perfect crime,

34:27.690 --> 34:30.818
but occasionally, criminals
walk free due to dumb luck.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.862
It's not a... perfect
universe, is it, Watson?

34:32.900 --> 34:34.561
Well, that sounds like

34:34.600 --> 34:36.534
giving up. I mean,
I know no one's quitting.

34:36.570 --> 34:38.663
I-I just hate that these guys
are getting away with it.

34:38.710 --> 34:41.531
We might not be able
to prove our case in court...

34:41.580 --> 34:43.468
but that doesn't mean
we can't punish them.

34:43.510 --> 34:45.603
What, are you gonna whip them
with a cherry Danish?

34:46.650 --> 34:49.369
No, I'm going to use this.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.546
We need to reconvene

34:50.580 --> 34:52.684
the council of rabbis and imams.

34:59.560 --> 35:01.448
Do you seriously think
this is gonna work?

35:01.500 --> 35:03.525
I have no earthly idea.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.528
Morning.

35:05.570 --> 35:06.798
We'd like to see
the coconspirators

35:06.830 --> 35:09.628
in the murder of Joaquin Pereya.

35:09.670 --> 35:10.659
Our lavwers are
on their way here.

35:10.700 --> 35:12.509
I'm gonna do everything I can

35:12.540 --> 35:13.461
to sue you two for harassment.

35:13.510 --> 35:14.909
Gentlemen,
we have unearthed

35:14.940 --> 35:17.579
no new evidence
against you.

35:17.610 --> 35:19.601
Despite our best efforts,

35:19.650 --> 35:20.639
we are unable to prove

35:20.680 --> 35:21.669
that the two of you

35:21.720 --> 35:23.278
murdered Joaquin Pereya.

35:23.320 --> 35:24.742
Then what are you doing here?

35:24.790 --> 35:27.543
We can make a compelling
circumstantial argument

35:27.590 --> 35:28.750
that you are guilty
and we did

35:28.790 --> 35:30.280
last night...

35:30.320 --> 35:31.753
to the Convocation
of Orthodox Rabbis

35:31.790 --> 35:33.553
and the I.C.H.,

35:33.590 --> 35:34.796
their equivalent
in the Muslim faith.

35:34.830 --> 35:36.650
Are you familiar
with those bodies?

35:36.700 --> 35:38.622
They're the ones who will
be deciding whether or not

35:38.670 --> 35:39.796
your shmeat can be sold

35:39.830 --> 35:42.196
to the halal and
kosher communities.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.458
They asked us
to pass on a message.

35:44.510 --> 35:45.863
Murder is not kosher.

35:45.910 --> 35:47.309
Oh? And what is that

35:47.340 --> 35:48.637
supposed to mean?

35:48.680 --> 35:50.238
We demonstrated
to the satisfaction

35:50.280 --> 35:52.498
of various religious
worthies that your shmeat

35:52.550 --> 35:54.643
became eligible
to be pareve

35:54.680 --> 35:56.318
by virtue of foul play.

35:56.350 --> 35:57.840
The imams and the rabbis
have got no intention

35:57.880 --> 35:59.689
of rewarding murder.

35:59.720 --> 36:01.187
They're never gonna
bless you with the labels

36:01.220 --> 36:02.881
that you seek and
they're going to use

36:02.920 --> 36:04.251
their influence
to see to it

36:04.290 --> 36:06.349
that other
certifying bodies

36:06.390 --> 36:07.721
follow their lead.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.728
_You can still sell it
in the vegan aisle,

36:09.760 --> 36:10.897
but good luck
staying in business.

36:12.770 --> 36:14.897
So, this is some
kind of retribution.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.931
You are going to rob the world
of our product

36:16.970 --> 36:20.565
because you can't prove
your insane theories.

36:20.610 --> 36:21.804
Maybe your shmeat
will go to market.

36:21.840 --> 36:22.932
Maybe it won't.

36:22.980 --> 36:24.277
The rabbis and imams

36:24.310 --> 36:25.607
have agreed
to change their minds

36:25.650 --> 36:28.619
on one condition: _
someone has to be conVIcted

36:28.650 --> 36:30.413
of Joaquin Pereya's murder.

36:30.450 --> 36:32.315
I don't understand.

36:32.350 --> 36:33.612
But we don't
need you to.

36:33.650 --> 36:35.982
Our appeal is
to Mr. Farley.

36:36.020 --> 36:38.352
He committed
the actual murder.

36:38.390 --> 36:40.324
Ground a corpse
into sausage meat.

36:40.360 --> 36:41.827
All you did was
fake some data.

36:41.860 --> 36:43.327
WATSON:
When we explained that

36:43.360 --> 36:44.827
to our captain,
he called the DA

36:44.870 --> 36:46.497
They're willing
to be flexible.

36:46.530 --> 36:47.428
In exchange
for your testimony,

36:47.470 --> 36:49.631
they will arrange a plea
that sees you serve

36:49.670 --> 36:51.399
no jail time.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.566
HOLMES:
He'll be convicted

36:52.610 --> 36:53.668
of Joaquin Pereya's murder.

36:53.710 --> 36:55.234
The shmeat will be, uh,

36:57.410 --> 36:58.968
and you can participate
in the profits

36:59.010 --> 37:00.443
while he rots in jail.

37:00.480 --> 37:02.243
Brendan, don't listen to them.

37:02.280 --> 37:05.408
For all you know,
they're bluffing.

37:05.450 --> 37:08.715
Or you can remain united
in relative penury.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.580
I mean, you know, he's
really good to his partners.

37:10.620 --> 37:12.588
He skinned the
last one and, uh...

37:12.630 --> 37:14.450
ground him into sausage.

37:14.500 --> 37:15.626
It's your choice,
Mr. Farley.

37:20.530 --> 37:23.761
NEWSWOMAN: Details of a shocking
crime continue to emerge as CEO,

37:23.800 --> 37:26.769
Werner Platz, is arrested for
the murder of Joaquin Pereya,

37:26.810 --> 37:28.573
the chief scientist
at his company.

37:28.610 --> 37:29.975
So, one coconspirator

37:30.010 --> 37:31.500
gets off nearly
scot-free

37:31.550 --> 37:32.949
in exchange for which the other

37:32.980 --> 37:33.969
is imprisoned for murder.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.272
Satisfactory outcome?

37:37.320 --> 37:39.584
I'll take it.

37:39.620 --> 37:41.656
It's a random universe.

37:41.690 --> 37:42.918
...of the actual murder...

37:42.960 --> 37:44.450
Where are you going?

37:44.490 --> 37:46.526
A meeting.

37:46.560 --> 37:48.790
Will you be following me
to confirm?

37:48.830 --> 37:50.627
Do I need to?

37:50.660 --> 37:53.663
* Life is like a storm

37:53.700 --> 37:57.363
* When we find out,
it's gone... *

37:59.370 --> 38:04.774
If no one else wants to share,
we'll wrap up for tonight.

38:04.810 --> 38:06.573
Okay, then.

38:06.610 --> 38:10.546
Yes. It's nice to see you again.

38:10.580 --> 38:12.639
Please.

38:12.690 --> 38:14.578
Thanks. Uh...
(clears throat)

38:14.620 --> 38:17.088
Hello, my name is Sherlock
and I'm an addict.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.678
ALL:
Hello, Sherlock.

38:18.730 --> 38:20.789
I'm also...

38:22.500 --> 38:24.468
...I'm the cleverest person
in the room.

38:26.800 --> 38:32.466
Now, I'm... I'm so much
cleverer than my peers

38:32.510 --> 38:35.775
that I've come to believe
I feel boredom more acutely

38:35.810 --> 38:37.675
than everybody else...

38:37.710 --> 38:39.803
* Would you care at all?

38:39.850 --> 38:43.069
...which leads me
to my recent quandary...

38:43.120 --> 38:46.112
arrogance.

38:46.150 --> 38:49.551
My-my own arrogance,
you know, to be precise.

38:51.090 --> 38:52.648
And the possibility
that that might be

38:52.690 --> 38:55.921
an Achilles' heel
to my recovery.

38:55.960 --> 38:59.760
* Would you care at all?
