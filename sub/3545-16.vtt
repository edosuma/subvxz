00:00.166 --> 00:02.000
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.083 --> 00:03.166
Hi, Maisy.

00:04.667 --> 00:06.417
Are you having an affair with Rex?

00:06.500 --> 00:09.166
<i>Mistresses were confronted.</i>

00:09.250 --> 00:11.667
- What's that?
- I'm on house arrest.

00:11.750 --> 00:14.458
- How are you gonna work?
- I can't.

00:14.542 --> 00:16.625
<i>The tables were turned.</i>

00:16.750 --> 00:20.166
- Good Lord, that's Angela.
<i>- And secrets from the past...</i>

00:20.250 --> 00:23.834
- My wife’s name was Mary Alice.
<i>- ...caught up with everyone.</i>

00:23.917 --> 00:27.250
I'm such an idiot!
You're such a liar. Oh, and a killer.

00:32.417 --> 00:36.166
<i>Even in the most respectable</i>
<i>of neighborhoods,</i>

00:36.250 --> 00:38.750
<i>you can hear the sound of scandal.</i>

00:42.250 --> 00:45.583
<i>Some scandals</i>
<i>announce themselves with a shout.</i>

00:45.709 --> 00:49.291
Ida? Ida Greenberg,
that is not your paper.

00:50.875 --> 00:53.709
<i>Some with a whisper.</i>

00:53.834 --> 00:57.250
Throw me a 20,
and I'll hook you up with free porn.

01:00.125 --> 01:04.834
<i>- And some with a bang.</i>
- Get the hell off my lawn!

01:05.458 --> 01:10.208
<i>And once in great while, there</i>
<i>comes a scandal so deliciously sordid,</i>

01:10.291 --> 01:13.208
<i>its roar drowns out all other noise.</i>

01:14.041 --> 01:18.583
Does your husband have any idea how
many men pay to sleep in this bed?

01:18.667 --> 01:23.083
There's not a lot of sleeping going on.
Not if I'm doing my job right.

01:24.625 --> 01:27.333
So, how do you wanna get started?

01:27.417 --> 01:29.625
With these.

01:29.750 --> 01:32.834
Well! That's gonna cost you extra.

01:32.959 --> 01:36.917
Maisy Gibbons,
you're under arrest for solicitation.

01:37.041 --> 01:39.625
- What?
- Please place your hands on the bed.

01:39.709 --> 01:43.000
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Now.

01:43.125 --> 01:45.917
Hey! Get off me!

01:46.000 --> 01:50.709
This is entrapment.
You all are making a gigantic mistake.

01:50.834 --> 01:54.166
Yeah, yeah. Hey, fellas,
here's one for your memoirs.

01:54.291 --> 01:55.333
Hey!

01:59.333 --> 02:03.500
No! No, don't you touch me!
You get your hands off me!

02:03.625 --> 02:05.208
Take it easy.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.667
<i>Yes, the scandalous arrest</i>
<i>of Maisy Gibbons</i>

02:08.792 --> 02:12.208
<i>would soon prove to be the shot</i>
<i>heard round the world.</i>

02:53.667 --> 02:56.208
Don’t you put me in here.

02:56.291 --> 03:00.083
<i>It is often said</i>
<i>that good news travels fast.</i>

03:00.166 --> 03:04.583
<i>But as every housewife knows,</i>
<i>bad news moves quite a bit faster.</i>

03:04.667 --> 03:10.709
Tish? You are not going to believe this.
Maisy Gibbons was arrested.

03:10.792 --> 03:13.667
- You cannot be serious!
- Did you hear about Maisy?

03:16.917 --> 03:20.709
Maisy Gibbons running in handcuffs?
I'd have killed to see that!

03:20.792 --> 03:22.583
Stay put. I'll be right back.

03:22.667 --> 03:27.417
Ladies, please calm down.
This is just a precaution.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.625
- If you'll just take a flyer,
- Hey, guys. What's going on?

03:30.792 --> 03:33.834
There's been an outbreak of head lice.

03:33.917 --> 03:34.917
Head lice?

03:35.000 --> 03:38.542
These flyers detail
all the important information,

03:38.625 --> 03:41.959
including
the recommended delousing combs.

03:42.083 --> 03:44.333
Delousing. It sounds so disgusting.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.834
- Anybody know where it started?
- That's confidential.

03:47.917 --> 03:50.959
Barcliff maintains
a strict "no blame" policy.

03:51.041 --> 03:52.083
Guys, over here.

03:52.166 --> 03:56.000
Parents have a right to know
who brought this into our school.

03:56.125 --> 04:00.834
Please calm down, ma'am. There's nothing
to be gained by pointing fingers.

04:00.959 --> 04:05.208
To identify the child who initiated
the outbreak might result in him

04:05.291 --> 04:08.208
or her being subjected to ridicule.

04:09.375 --> 04:12.125
I... Excuse me.

04:12.208 --> 04:15.792
- If you'll just take a flyer...
- Stop scratching.

04:15.875 --> 04:18.583
Stop it. Guys, let's go, OK?

04:18.667 --> 04:20.792
Stop scratching. Stop, stop.

04:21.625 --> 04:24.875
- Hey. See you later.
- Bye.

04:39.166 --> 04:41.291
What the hell...?

04:43.583 --> 04:46.166
- Gabrielle!
- What?

04:46.291 --> 04:50.667
- Gabrielle. We got a problem here.
- I can't hear you.

04:50.750 --> 04:53.792
I think we got a problem.
The water's backing up here.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.750
What?

04:55.834 --> 04:57.208
Is that sewage?

04:59.125 --> 05:02.000
Yeah, that's sewage.

05:02.083 --> 05:05.375
So, Mike,
the suspense is killing us.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.542
Just tell us the bad news.

05:08.125 --> 05:11.667
Your outtake pipe's corroded.
That's why it collapsed.

05:11.750 --> 05:14.542
I’ll have to re-pipe the whole system.

05:14.625 --> 05:17.041
And how much is this gonna cost?

05:17.125 --> 05:21.041
I'll do the job at cost, but you're
still looking at six, seven grand.

05:22.667 --> 05:24.583
OK, we'll let you know.

05:26.667 --> 05:29.333
Look, if money's an issue...

05:29.417 --> 05:31.875
Oh, no. It's not the money.

05:31.959 --> 05:36.500
Carlos and I are prioritizing some
things we need to do around the house.

05:36.583 --> 05:40.792
You don't consider sewage
backing up in the house a priority?

05:40.917 --> 05:43.959
It's definitely on the short list.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.000
I'm surprised you called me.

05:50.083 --> 05:53.667
- Why?
- Well, um, ever since my arrest,

05:53.750 --> 05:57.750
nobody around here seems
to want to have much to do with me.

05:59.542 --> 06:02.583
Innocent until proven guilty, my man.

06:04.291 --> 06:06.875
I hope he's more innocent than you are.

06:06.959 --> 06:10.500
<i>Hey, it's Lynette. I know</i>
<i>you're down about this Mike thing,</i>

06:10.625 --> 06:13.875
<i>but you gotta come to poker.</i>
<i>It'll be worth it.</i>

06:13.959 --> 06:16.250
<i>I got dirt on Maisy Gibbons.</i>

06:17.500 --> 06:23.000
<i>Hey, Susan, it's me. Look, I really wish</i>
<i>you'd return my calls.</i>

06:23.083 --> 06:25.792
<i>We need to talk.</i>
<i>I know I messed things...</i>

06:26.625 --> 06:27.625
You OK?

06:29.583 --> 06:30.625
Hi.

06:30.709 --> 06:34.625
- You know I can stay home if you want.
- No, no, no. Now, I know how much

06:34.750 --> 06:38.959
you were looking forward to this weekend
with your dad. I'm fine.

06:39.041 --> 06:42.625
- You don't look fine.
- Well, I'm a little sad.

06:43.792 --> 06:45.792
Mike and I were just a fling.

06:45.917 --> 06:49.834
Not even a full fling.
Sort of a borderline fling.

06:49.917 --> 06:53.000
Mom, anyone can see
how much you loved him.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.792
I also loved junk food
and I gave that up.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.959
There's your father. Go have fun.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.375
Last chance. You sure?

07:03.500 --> 07:05.417
I'm sure. Now, go.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.583
You'll find someone else, Mom.

07:17.667 --> 07:19.417
Someone great.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.625
I know it.

07:33.208 --> 07:36.959
What's wrong? Didn't you enjoy
your golf game with Dr Wallace?

07:37.041 --> 07:39.959
I didn't play.
I'm still feeling sluggish.

07:40.083 --> 07:42.583
Still? Did you talk to him about that?

07:42.709 --> 07:47.250
Of course. He doesn't know
why the medication isn't working.

07:49.709 --> 07:54.458
Tish is making the rounds.
She must have some juicy anecdote.

07:54.542 --> 07:57.458
Get her over here.
I could use a funny story today.

07:57.917 --> 07:59.583
Tish! Tish!

08:01.667 --> 08:06.000
I can tell you've got something good.
Now come on, don't be selfish.

08:06.083 --> 08:10.709
Well, first off, you're not friends
with Maisy Gibbons, are you?

08:12.291 --> 08:15.875
- No.
- Thank God, because this is too good.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.083
Maisy was arrested.

08:18.250 --> 08:22.250
While Harold was at work, she was
having sex in her house for money.

08:22.375 --> 08:24.083
Can you imagine?

08:27.125 --> 08:28.208
No. I can't.

08:28.291 --> 08:33.375
And word is, she had a little black book
with all her clients' names.

08:36.458 --> 08:39.625
So... you think that'll get out?

08:39.709 --> 08:41.291
Of course!

08:41.375 --> 08:45.333
Nancy, Wait up.
I can't wait to tell you this.

08:46.917 --> 08:50.208
Well, you heard your funny story, Rex.

08:50.291 --> 08:52.500
Why aren't you laughing?

09:02.792 --> 09:04.917
I'll get it.

09:06.458 --> 09:10.625
- Ah-ah-ah.
- Hello? Hi, Tammy. Yeah...

09:10.709 --> 09:14.959
- Can we see one of the bugs?
- Yeah, here. See?

09:15.083 --> 09:20.375
It's this little white thing.
Look, it looks like a sesame seed.

09:20.458 --> 09:23.709
- That's cool.
- Lots more where that came from.

09:23.792 --> 09:26.583
No, I'm so sorry.
He must be so disappointed.

09:26.667 --> 09:31.000
We'll get all the boys together
once Topher's back on his feet.

09:31.083 --> 09:33.291
- Bye.
- What'd Tammy want?

09:33.417 --> 09:36.834
She's canceling Topher's party
He's got measles.

09:36.917 --> 09:39.458
Measles, huh?

09:39.583 --> 09:40.625
Yeah.

09:42.417 --> 09:43.417
What?

09:43.500 --> 09:45.917
Tammy spent a fortune
on Topher's party.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.917
She'd call in specialists from
Switzerland before she'd cancel it.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.625
Why would Tammy lie to us?

09:52.709 --> 09:58.542
She saw Porter scratching his head
at school. Now word's getting around.

09:58.667 --> 10:02.834
Why is everything a conspiracy theory?
Kids get lice. It's not a big deal.

10:02.917 --> 10:06.250
It is for the rich B-I-T-C-H-es
at Barcliff Academy.

10:06.333 --> 10:09.583
It's been one day and
they've been disinvited to a party.

10:09.667 --> 10:15.417
If rumors start flying, these boys can
kiss campouts and pool parties goodbye.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.959
Uh-oh.

10:17.041 --> 10:19.166
Yeah. Not so cool now, huh?

10:21.667 --> 10:25.250
It's all here. Appraisal,
title search, escrow documents.

10:25.375 --> 10:29.166
Sorry about changing my mind but
it's not a good time to sell the house.

10:29.250 --> 10:32.041
Zach wants to finish high school
before moving.

10:32.125 --> 10:35.709
It's part of the business.
I expect to get screwed over.

10:36.667 --> 10:38.750
Now, where is your house key?

10:41.083 --> 10:44.417
I must have left it at home.
I'll bring it by tonight.

10:44.500 --> 10:48.667
Zach's away and I'm going
to Mount Pleasant on business today.

10:48.750 --> 10:53.750
- Just drop it by tomorrow.
- Or I could just keep it.

10:53.875 --> 10:54.959
What?

10:55.041 --> 10:59.875
It's a joke. I know your wife's dead
but it's been six months. Lighten up.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.500
- Hello!
- Felicia.

11:03.583 --> 11:05.250
Oh. Hi, Felicia.

11:05.333 --> 11:09.291
Edie, I found this in my sister's
things. It has your name on it.

11:10.500 --> 11:16.125
My necklace! Oh, you know,
I lent this to Martha three months ago.

11:16.208 --> 11:19.333
And she said
that it went down the drain.

11:20.709 --> 11:23.875
I miss how we used to steal things
from one another.

11:23.959 --> 11:27.750
So, Felicia, I heard they have
a suspect in your sister's murder.

11:29.083 --> 11:32.041
- Mike Delfino?
- He didn't kill her.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.333
They found her jewelry in his garage.

11:34.417 --> 11:38.166
- His fingerprints weren't on any of it.
- Just means he wore gloves.

11:38.250 --> 11:40.250
So, he's smart enough to use gloves,

11:40.333 --> 11:43.834
but he leaves her blood-spattered
jewelry lying around

11:43.917 --> 11:49.208
for anyone to find? Please. Is that
what you'd do if you killed someone?

11:49.333 --> 11:52.458
I don't know what goes through
the mind of a murderer.

11:52.542 --> 11:55.458
I'm just saying
I wouldn't trust him if I were you.

11:58.375 --> 12:01.458
Edie, that is lovely.

12:01.542 --> 12:04.208
- Is it an antique?
- Yeah. I think so.

12:04.291 --> 12:08.458
I know a store you would love.
It specializes in antique jewelry.

12:08.542 --> 12:12.291
It's in Salt Lake City.
Have you ever been to Salt Lake City?

12:12.375 --> 12:17.333
No. I try to steer clear of Utah.
It's a little too conservative for me.

12:17.417 --> 12:20.625
Too bad. Have you ever been, Paul?

12:21.792 --> 12:23.208
No.

12:23.291 --> 12:27.917
It's lovely. I used to live there
when I was a nurse.

12:29.500 --> 12:32.750
You should definitely go some time.

12:33.792 --> 12:34.834
Bye.

12:38.375 --> 12:40.834
<i>With no indoor plumbing,</i>

12:40.917 --> 12:46.333
<i>Gabrielle was now forced to improvise</i>
<i>when it came to her personal hygiene,</i>

12:46.417 --> 12:49.750
<i>wherever and whenever</i>
<i>she had the opportunity.</i>

12:53.291 --> 12:56.041
- Sorry.
- That's OK.

12:56.166 --> 12:59.125
I was just about to give
a Maisy Gibbons update.

12:59.208 --> 13:05.417
Guys, we should be ashamed of ourselves
for reveling in that woman's misery.

13:05.500 --> 13:08.875
That being said, Edie, please continue.

13:10.375 --> 13:12.959
I hear from a very reliable source

13:13.041 --> 13:16.250
that Maisy's gonna cut a deal
with the prosecution.

13:16.375 --> 13:19.625
Apparently,
she has some high-profile johns

13:19.709 --> 13:22.291
and the DA's looking for a second term.

13:22.375 --> 13:26.542
I don't get it.
I don't get who would pay Maisy for sex.

13:26.667 --> 13:30.417
Obviously someone
who's not getting it at home.

13:30.500 --> 13:34.583
So, the upshot is Maisy is going to
turn over her little black book

13:34.667 --> 13:37.125
with all of her clients' names.

13:37.208 --> 13:39.041
Really?

13:39.166 --> 13:42.208
Can you imagine
the fallout when this goes public?

13:43.458 --> 13:45.083
Blood on the walls.

13:47.375 --> 13:50.542
- I'm all in.
- I'll call.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.083
Bree?

13:57.875 --> 14:02.500
- What just happened?
- The stakes were raised.

14:02.583 --> 14:04.667
Yes. Yes, they were.

14:06.709 --> 14:07.834
I fold.

14:08.709 --> 14:10.750
You were lucky today.

14:10.875 --> 14:14.875
Luck had nothing to do with it.
I was bluffing the entire time.

14:14.959 --> 14:16.834
Really? Wow. You're good.

14:16.917 --> 14:21.166
That's the only nice thing
I can say about my first husband.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.917
- He taught me how to bluff.
- He played poker?

14:24.000 --> 14:29.208
No. He was lousy in bed.
I had to fake a lot of orgasms.

14:32.250 --> 14:35.458
- You don't have to respond.
- Thank you.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.959
So, where was Susan today?

14:41.500 --> 14:42.792
I'm not sure.

14:42.875 --> 14:46.250
Wow. Tom must be great in bed.

14:47.458 --> 14:52.625
Obviously,
you have no idea how to bluff.

14:52.709 --> 14:57.083
OK, she's going through something and
I'm sure she'd prefer it to be private.

14:57.166 --> 15:00.500
She's upset with Mike, isn't she?

15:00.625 --> 15:04.709
Well, come on.
I'm gonna find out sooner or later.

15:04.834 --> 15:08.875
She's devastated about the break-up
and she hasn't left the house in days.

15:08.959 --> 15:12.166
Well, why didn't you just tell me that?

15:12.250 --> 15:16.792
It's personal. It's the kind of thing
she would only tell her friends.

15:16.875 --> 15:19.291
I'm Susan's friend.

15:20.625 --> 15:23.917
Well, I don't hate her.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.750
If you want me to share stuff with you,
be more supportive of Susan.

15:27.834 --> 15:30.458
OK. How?

15:31.583 --> 15:35.333
What do friends do? They call.
They're sympathetic.

15:35.458 --> 15:40.583
They ask about the pain the other person
is going through and then they listen.

15:40.667 --> 15:43.083
What if you want to be supportive,

15:43.166 --> 15:46.500
but you just can't stand
listening to people bitch?

15:46.583 --> 15:49.041
Then it's good to know how to bluff.

16:07.583 --> 16:11.834
<i>- Congratulations.</i>
<i>- Thank you, thank you.</i>

16:14.959 --> 16:17.041
<i>I know, it’s very exciting.</i>

16:17.125 --> 16:19.166
<i>Thank you.</i>

16:19.250 --> 16:22.709
<i>You know, I really think</i>
<i>you do deserve this award...</i>

16:40.583 --> 16:43.166
God, I have to go to the bathroom again.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.875
- Go to Bree's.
- I've been to Bree's.

16:45.959 --> 16:48.375
- Then go to Susan's.
- I hate Susan's.

16:48.458 --> 16:52.083
She has all these weird scented candles.
It reeks of apricot.

16:52.208 --> 16:53.333
Hose.

16:53.417 --> 16:55.000
How about Lynette's?

16:55.083 --> 16:58.375
No. I don't want
to go to anybody's house anymore.

16:58.458 --> 17:02.875
I'm tired of making up excuses
as to why we haven't fixed our plumbing.

17:02.959 --> 17:05.500
- Why yell at me?
- It's your fault.

17:05.625 --> 17:06.625
My fault?

17:06.709 --> 17:10.000
If you hadn't gotten indicted,
we would have pipes now.

17:10.083 --> 17:14.667
I got indicted making money to keep you
happy. You're a little materialistic.

17:14.750 --> 17:18.166
Me? When the Johnson's
bought their new seven series

17:18.250 --> 17:22.417
you were the one who went and
traded in his car for something better.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.917
Who ended up driving it?

17:25.000 --> 17:28.208
I don't have time to fight right now.
I have laundry to do.

17:38.625 --> 17:44.000
- Nurse Abigail?
- Mrs. Scavo, right? The twins' mother?

17:44.083 --> 17:48.709
Yeah. I just wanted to tell you
that the boys are now lice-free.

17:48.792 --> 17:50.834
Good to hear.

17:54.417 --> 17:57.125
I just can't figure out
how it happened.

17:57.250 --> 18:02.625
They get a bath every night. Trust me.
It's the ugliest 15 minutes of the day.

18:02.709 --> 18:04.625
I believe you.

18:05.834 --> 18:11.083
I keep thinking maybe it was the
petting zoo I took them to last week.

18:11.166 --> 18:15.625
- That llama was really iffy.
- Mrs. Scavo, it doesn't work that way.

18:15.709 --> 18:19.667
Lice spreads from human to human.
The cleanest kid in the world can get it

18:19.750 --> 18:22.166
if he gets too close to the wrong kid.

18:22.250 --> 18:24.083
- Really?
- Yes.

18:24.166 --> 18:27.917
- So don't be so hard on yourself.
- I guess.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.792
Still, I can't help but feel guilty.

18:30.875 --> 18:34.000
After all, my kids
started an entire lice outbreak.

18:34.125 --> 18:38.083
Look, your...
your kids didn't start it.

18:38.166 --> 18:41.166
They didn't?

18:41.291 --> 18:45.375
No. I know for a fact that
Patient Zero was another little boy.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.542
This is his fourth time
with this particular problem.

18:49.625 --> 18:50.792
Oh.

18:51.875 --> 18:54.000
That's a load off my mind.

18:55.625 --> 18:57.750
Well, thank you.

19:01.250 --> 19:05.208
- So which kid is it?
- I can't tell you.

19:05.333 --> 19:07.667
You know we have a "no blame" policy.

19:07.750 --> 19:10.417
We have to protect the children.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.583
Of course.

19:14.542 --> 19:17.291
No, I don't.
You're gonna have to give me a name.

19:17.375 --> 19:19.375
- Mrs. Scavo...
- Here's the thing.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.667
Acting like parents won't assign blame

19:21.750 --> 19:25.041
is like pretending they don't keep score
at Pee Wee League.

19:25.125 --> 19:27.667
If you don't give the mob
someone to blame,

19:27.750 --> 19:31.333
they'll pick a scapegoat.
I can't let my boys be the scapegoat.

19:31.417 --> 19:34.458
- Don't put me in this position.
- I'm begging you.

19:34.542 --> 19:38.542
They've been uninvited from a party.
A really big birthday party,

19:38.625 --> 19:41.709
with a bouncy house,
a hotdog stand, a clown.

19:41.792 --> 19:43.333
I wish I could help you.

19:43.417 --> 19:45.625
There's gonna be a magician!

19:45.750 --> 19:47.834
Tammy Brennan went all out.

19:49.375 --> 19:52.834
Tammy Brennan? Topher's mother?

19:52.917 --> 19:54.250
Yes.

19:56.083 --> 20:00.250
Well, isn't that interesting?
Have a seat.

20:03.792 --> 20:07.041
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>at the Fairview County Prison,</i>

20:07.125 --> 20:10.959
<i>Maisy Gibbons was delighted</i>
<i>to find out she had a visitor.</i>

20:11.041 --> 20:15.291
<i>But she was soon reminded,</i>
<i>one should always beware of visitors</i>

20:15.375 --> 20:17.458
<i>bearing gift baskets.</i>

20:19.333 --> 20:22.208
You've gotta be kidding me.

20:22.291 --> 20:24.375
Hello, Maisy.

21:05.500 --> 21:08.208
Stuff like this is why I love you.

21:18.458 --> 21:21.375
So, what brings you here?

21:21.458 --> 21:23.917
I need a favor.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.458
I thought as much.

21:27.750 --> 21:33.166
I heard that there's a little black book
with the name of your clients in it.

21:34.208 --> 21:35.291
There is.

21:35.375 --> 21:41.250
I was wondering if, perhaps, you could
remove Rex's name from that little book?

21:41.375 --> 21:48.041
Wow. That's a big favor.
Those muffins better be really good.

21:49.709 --> 21:54.041
I have some money that
I've been putting aside for emergencies.

21:54.125 --> 21:56.333
It can be all yours, if you just...

21:56.417 --> 21:58.542
Keep my mouth shut?

22:00.333 --> 22:02.792
Continue to be discreet.

22:02.875 --> 22:06.709
Gosh, I don't know.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.667
I don't think it's asking that much.

22:10.750 --> 22:13.333
All you need to do
is remove one little name.

22:13.417 --> 22:18.250
But if I do it for you, then I have
to do it for all the other wives.

22:19.542 --> 22:21.834
That wouldn't be fair, now, would it?

22:21.959 --> 22:26.458
Maisy, please.
I mean, we used to be good friends.

22:26.583 --> 22:30.083
Where were you when Harold
lost his job a year ago, huh?

22:30.208 --> 22:32.667
Did you ask if there
was anything you could do?

22:32.750 --> 22:34.917
Did you bring
a basket of baked goods

22:35.000 --> 22:37.875
when you knew
we couldn't even pay our bills?

22:37.959 --> 22:43.750
If you did, those displays of friendship
seemed to have slipped my mind.

22:43.834 --> 22:48.750
Maisy, I didn't mention it when you were
having financial troubles because...

22:48.875 --> 22:53.291
- I thought it would embarrass you.
- I would've been embarrassed.

22:53.333 --> 22:56.709
But it would have been
a whole lot better than the silence.

22:57.792 --> 23:01.291
I have $14,000 in that account.
It can all be yours.

23:05.625 --> 23:08.041
I'm not interested.

23:12.917 --> 23:16.458
But you do get credit for one thing.

23:16.542 --> 23:21.375
You came to visit me.
Even if it was for an ulterior motive.

23:21.458 --> 23:26.959
None of the girls from the club
bothered. I've been abandoned.

23:27.041 --> 23:30.417
Guess that's what happens
when you become the town whore.

23:30.500 --> 23:35.542
Sweetie, they didn't abandon you
because you're a whore.

23:35.625 --> 23:40.000
They abandoned you because
you weren't all that nice to begin with.

23:56.792 --> 23:58.834
- Who is it?
- It's Edie.

23:58.959 --> 24:00.792
Edie, not now. I'm busy.

24:00.875 --> 24:03.417
- Hi.
- Or just come on in.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.959
What are you doing?

24:06.041 --> 24:09.667
I decided that
my life is way too complicated.

24:09.750 --> 24:14.542
And so I'm simplifying.
I am getting rid of the clutter.

24:15.583 --> 24:17.083
Ooh.

24:17.875 --> 24:20.875
I was on vacation.
It made sense at the time.

24:22.542 --> 24:26.083
OK, not to be rude,
but is there a reason you're here?

24:26.166 --> 24:30.667
I feel badly about
what you're going through with Mike.

24:30.750 --> 24:34.542
- Don't worry, I'm not gonna date him.
- It doesn't matter anymore.

24:34.667 --> 24:39.208
Well, don't get me wrong. I still have
every intention of sleeping with him.

24:39.291 --> 24:41.875
Some mountains
are just meant to be climbed.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.208
I gotta learn to keep my doors locked.

24:45.709 --> 24:47.792
How long have you been sitting here?

24:47.875 --> 24:52.041
I don't know. Five minutes,
give or take three hours?

24:52.125 --> 24:55.291
That's it. Get up. Get dressed.

24:55.375 --> 24:57.458
- Why?
- You're coming with me.

24:57.542 --> 25:01.125
It's time to get wasted.
Happy Hour started 45 minutes ago.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.125
Why would I go anywhere with you?

25:03.208 --> 25:06.333
That's what normal women do
when they get depressed.

25:06.417 --> 25:09.500
They put on short skirts,
they go to bars,

25:09.583 --> 25:14.583
have one too many and make out with
a man in the back of a dark alley.

25:14.709 --> 25:16.291
Wow.

25:16.417 --> 25:18.709
Come on. It'll be fun.

25:18.792 --> 25:20.792
I swear. Come on.

25:20.875 --> 25:23.333
- Come on!
- Why do you even care?

25:23.417 --> 25:26.500
I never said I cared.

25:26.583 --> 25:28.542
It's just...

25:28.625 --> 25:34.583
Well, I guess I know what it's like
to have your heart stomped on.

25:37.208 --> 25:42.291
OK. All right. Gimme a minute.
I'll go change my clothes.

25:44.125 --> 25:47.750
And don't forget to do something
with that skanky hair.

25:47.834 --> 25:50.166
You're a little scary looking.

25:55.083 --> 25:57.792
Ah! What about him?

25:57.959 --> 25:59.500
Not my type.

25:59.625 --> 26:03.834
The pickin’s are slim, but isn't
there someone here you're attracted to?

26:03.917 --> 26:08.083
I hate 'em all.
Look at 'em just leering at us.

26:08.166 --> 26:11.250
They're so cocky.
They know they have the upper hand.

26:11.333 --> 26:15.500
We have the upper hand.
Without us, they have nothing.

26:15.583 --> 26:19.625
Maybe 15 years ago. Not anymore.
Now we're just lonely and desperate.

26:19.709 --> 26:23.625
And they know it. And they
just sit there, ready to pounce,

26:23.709 --> 26:29.250
waiting for us to take any crumb
they're willing to throw our way.

26:29.333 --> 26:32.166
I don't want crumbs. I want Mike.

26:32.250 --> 26:36.000
Hi. Um, I'm gonna be
spending the whole night with her,

26:36.083 --> 26:39.458
so I'm gonna be needing
a lot more of these.

26:39.542 --> 26:44.041
I'm sorry. It's just so hard
to find a guy like Mike.

26:44.125 --> 26:46.959
I know in my heart
he didn't kill Mrs. Huber.

26:47.041 --> 26:51.417
OK. Let's say Mike's a peach.
And he didn't kill Martha. Who did?

26:51.500 --> 26:52.875
I don't know.

26:52.959 --> 26:58.208
Obviously, a bad guy. Somebody
really awful. Somebody like...

26:58.333 --> 27:00.458
somebody like Paul Young.

27:00.542 --> 27:02.667
Paul?

27:04.291 --> 27:07.709
- Are you serious?
- He's hiding something.

27:07.792 --> 27:11.750
He clams up every time
we try to ask him about Mary Alice.

27:11.834 --> 27:14.959
And then when we found out about Dana...

27:15.041 --> 27:16.417
Who's Dana?

27:16.500 --> 27:20.166
Paul and Mary Alice
had a baby that died.

27:20.250 --> 27:21.959
You're kidding.

27:22.041 --> 27:25.417
- Zach killed her.
- Holy crap. Who told you that?

27:25.500 --> 27:27.583
Paul. He said it was an accident

27:27.709 --> 27:31.583
but I think that's why
Mary Alice was being blackmailed.

27:31.709 --> 27:34.709
- Mary Alice was being blackmailed?
- Yeah.

27:34.875 --> 27:38.917
The girls and I
found a threatening note in her stuff.

27:39.875 --> 27:42.166
What kind of street do we live on?

27:42.250 --> 27:44.291
I don't know.

27:46.583 --> 27:50.083
Come to think of it, the other day,
Paul was talking to Felicia

27:50.166 --> 27:54.041
and he was working overtime
trying to make Mike sound guilty.

27:54.125 --> 27:58.417
See? Shifting blame onto someone else.
Classic criminal behavior.

27:58.542 --> 28:00.417
He's up to no good.

28:00.542 --> 28:02.417
Zach and Paul are out of town.

28:02.542 --> 28:05.834
We should sneak into their house
and snoop. I have the key.

28:05.917 --> 28:09.458
- Oh, my God. Yes, we should do that.
- I was just kidding.

28:09.542 --> 28:12.583
This is our chance.
We should go in for ten minutes.

28:12.709 --> 28:15.083
That's breaking and entering.

28:15.166 --> 28:17.458
Martha Huber was your best friend.

28:17.542 --> 28:22.333
If we could find out who killed her,
wouldn't that be worth the risk?

28:26.291 --> 28:29.375
- Have a nice evening.
- Thank you.

28:29.458 --> 28:31.792
Serena, hi. How are you?

28:35.166 --> 28:37.750
- I talked to Dr Wallace today.
- Oh?

28:37.834 --> 28:40.667
Still no idea
why the medication's not working.

28:40.750 --> 28:42.834
He said he's thinking of more tests.

28:42.917 --> 28:47.333
I said I'm thinking
about getting a second opinion.

28:48.959 --> 28:54.250
Rex, this might sound silly,
but are people staring at us?

28:58.041 --> 29:01.583
Yeah. What's going on?

29:01.667 --> 29:06.041
Well, I could be wrong, but I suspect
that Maisy Gibbons' client list

29:06.125 --> 29:08.291
has been released.

29:13.542 --> 29:15.625
You think they're laughing at us?

29:15.709 --> 29:20.041
No, I think they're laughing at you.
I think they feel sorry for me,

29:20.166 --> 29:23.417
- which is just as mortifying.
- What are we gonna do?

29:23.500 --> 29:27.166
We're gonna act like
nothing is happening.

29:27.291 --> 29:29.333
And when we've finished eating,

29:29.417 --> 29:33.291
we'll walk out of here with
all the dignity that we can muster.

29:35.583 --> 29:37.291
Please. Let's go now.

29:37.375 --> 29:41.208
I refuse to give them this kind
of satisfaction. Open your menu.

29:41.333 --> 29:44.291
Everybody's staring.
Bree, it's humiliating.

29:44.375 --> 29:48.083
Should've thought of that before
you gave Maisy a personal check.

29:48.166 --> 29:50.500
All right. You stay here. I'm leaving.

29:50.583 --> 29:54.750
Rex! If you walk out of this restaurant,
I will scream.

29:54.834 --> 29:58.375
- Bree...
- I will scream about your cruelty,

29:58.458 --> 30:02.500
I will scream about your infidelity.
And to make sure it really hurts,

30:02.583 --> 30:07.000
I will scream about
your distasteful sexual habits.

30:07.125 --> 30:11.792
You want to know what true humiliation
is, you just take one step.

30:29.041 --> 30:34.250
So, what are you having?
The veal looks good.

30:45.583 --> 30:48.875
What are we looking for?
An embroidered pillow that says

30:48.959 --> 30:50.500
"I Killed Martha Huber"?

30:50.583 --> 30:53.208
I don't know.
Just something... suspicious.

30:56.625 --> 30:59.375
Mmm. Smells expensive.

31:04.542 --> 31:09.291
- Do you believe in evil, Edie?
- Of course. I work in real estate.

31:09.417 --> 31:15.041
I'm serious. There’s something about
this house that’s so cold and creepy.

31:15.125 --> 31:19.041
You couldn't tell
when Mary Alice was alive.

31:19.125 --> 31:22.709
She just brought so much
warmth and light.

31:25.125 --> 31:28.000
Now there's something...

31:28.125 --> 31:30.750
I can just taste it. Can't you sense it?

31:30.834 --> 31:34.583
The only thing I can sense
is that you've had too much to drink.

31:34.667 --> 31:40.291
Something happened in this house,
so awful we can't even imagine it.

31:41.125 --> 31:44.959
- Ow! Sonofabitch!
- Are you OK?

31:46.792 --> 31:48.959
I just stubbed my toe.

31:49.083 --> 31:52.166
- Oh, my God! Angela.
- Huh?

31:52.291 --> 31:54.500
Mary Alice used to call herself Angela.

31:54.625 --> 31:55.709
What?

31:55.834 --> 31:59.333
It was on a tape Bree stole
from her therapist's office.

31:59.417 --> 32:02.166
It's a long story.
We gotta pop this in.

32:06.166 --> 32:08.625
- What was that?
- I think it's Paul.

32:08.709 --> 32:13.041
- You said he was gonna be gone.
- Well, I guess I was wrong.

32:13.125 --> 32:15.208
- Hurry!
- I gotta get the tape.

32:15.959 --> 32:17.000
Hide!

32:44.834 --> 32:45.875
Paul.

32:47.375 --> 32:49.500
Edie! God, you scared me.

32:49.583 --> 32:50.709
I'm sorry.

32:50.834 --> 32:54.291
I see that you made it back
from Mount Pleasant.

32:54.375 --> 32:56.917
Yes.
What... what are you doing here?

32:57.000 --> 33:00.792
I came by to bring you your key.
I was just about to leave you a note.

33:00.875 --> 33:03.750
You're returning my key
at 11.30 at night?

33:03.875 --> 33:06.041
What the hell is going on here?

33:06.125 --> 33:10.333
You're right.
We're too old to be playing games.

33:10.417 --> 33:11.667
What?

33:11.750 --> 33:17.625
My note was gonna tell you that I...
I wasn't kidding this afternoon.

33:17.709 --> 33:20.667
I really would like to keep a key
to your place.

33:20.750 --> 33:24.709
To use if the mood strikes me.

33:25.625 --> 33:27.542
You've been drinking.

33:27.625 --> 33:31.291
Just enough to get up the courage
to tell you how I feel about you.

34:04.709 --> 34:08.750
OK, well, obviously
you're uncomfortable about this.

34:08.834 --> 34:12.709
So, I'm really sorry
if I embarrassed you. Here's your key.

34:14.834 --> 34:19.125
- I'll see you around.
- Edie. Um, I'm not embarrassed.

34:19.208 --> 34:22.917
- Huh?
- If anything, I'm flattered.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.917
Susan.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.709
Susan, talk to me.

34:31.792 --> 34:34.583
Mike, I'm a little drunk
and a little freaked out.

34:34.667 --> 34:36.583
You haven't returned my messages.

34:36.709 --> 34:39.625
We're broken up.
I thought I made that pretty clear.

34:39.709 --> 34:42.208
- Can't we work this out?
- You lied to me.

34:42.333 --> 34:43.709
When did I lie to you?

34:43.792 --> 34:47.792
The police showed me your rap sheet.
You killed a man.

34:47.875 --> 34:50.875
- You believe I'm a killer?
- No. Of course not.

34:50.959 --> 34:53.417
But I didn't believe
Karl would cheat on me.

34:53.500 --> 34:56.375
I didn't believe
Mary Alice would kill herself.

34:56.500 --> 34:58.625
Mike, blind faith is not my friend.

34:58.709 --> 35:01.417
I was gonna tell you.
There wasn't a right moment.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.583
Now that's a lie.
There were plenty of right moments.

35:04.709 --> 35:07.166
When we went for pizza,
you could've said,

35:07.250 --> 35:09.333
"By the way, I once killed a man".

35:09.417 --> 35:12.417
Or when you said, "Let's jog",
you could've said,

35:12.500 --> 35:14.625
"By the way, I killed a man".

35:14.709 --> 35:17.250
At the movies,
when the hero shot the bad guy,

35:17.333 --> 35:20.000
you could've said
"By the way, I did that once".

35:20.083 --> 35:22.083
You didn't.

35:22.166 --> 35:24.500
Do you want to hear what happened?

35:24.625 --> 35:28.709
It doesn't matter. I will never
believe anything you say again.

35:43.750 --> 35:46.542
Well, at the very least
you can believe that.

36:04.083 --> 36:07.125
- Occupied!
- Carlos, I have to go.

36:07.250 --> 36:09.041
You'll have to wait.

36:09.125 --> 36:11.000
It's my port-a-potty.

36:11.083 --> 36:14.083
- What do you mean it's yours?
- I'm the one who stole it.

36:14.166 --> 36:17.709
Babe, I'm sorry.
You're just gonna have to wait.

36:26.083 --> 36:30.250
Thank you so much, Bree. Seeing your
tile has helped me make my decision.

36:30.333 --> 36:33.500
Next time I remodel,
I am using limestone.

36:33.583 --> 36:36.542
Gabrielle, is everything OK?

36:37.792 --> 36:39.000
Sure. Why?

36:39.083 --> 36:42.625
Well, it's just that
you've been acting kinda odd lately.

36:42.709 --> 36:45.333
In what way?

36:45.417 --> 36:49.083
You keep coming up with excuses
to use everyone's bathroom.

36:49.166 --> 36:52.458
And then two days ago Mr. Cawley
looked into your back yard

36:52.583 --> 36:57.208
and saw you and Carlos
doing your laundry in the Jacuzzi.

36:58.959 --> 37:04.208
Well, there's a simple explanation
for that. I...

37:05.583 --> 37:09.458
Are you and Carlos
having some sort of money trouble?

37:09.542 --> 37:13.917
- Gaby, it's OK if you are.
- Is that so?

37:14.000 --> 37:16.792
Yes. And I'm a little insulted.

37:16.875 --> 37:22.375
I am a good friend. Why would you feel
like you have to hide that from me?

37:22.583 --> 37:29.625
Probably for the same reason you didn't
tell me Rex was one of Maisy's clients.

37:29.709 --> 37:31.959
That is obviously different.

37:32.041 --> 37:36.041
Why? Because it happened to you?

37:37.500 --> 37:39.208
Bree, this is how I see it:

37:39.333 --> 37:43.041
Good friends support each other
after they've been humiliated.

37:43.166 --> 37:47.041
Great friends pretend
nothing happened in the first place.

37:51.542 --> 37:56.083
Well, then, good luck on your remodel.

37:56.166 --> 37:59.709
And please tell Rex I said hello.

38:20.959 --> 38:24.709
- Hey, Tammy.
- Lynette!

38:26.375 --> 38:29.000
I see Topher's made a speedy recovery.

38:29.083 --> 38:32.125
- Can we go play?
- Yeah, sure, boys. Have fun.

38:32.208 --> 38:34.709
Let's go play in the bounce house.

38:37.208 --> 38:41.125
All right, you caught me. I lied.

38:41.208 --> 38:45.625
But you have some nerve crashing a six
year old's birthday party.

38:45.709 --> 38:48.750
Just so you know, I got Topher
a set of bongo drums.

38:48.834 --> 38:51.041
You'll love them
as much as he will.

38:51.166 --> 38:54.709
Charlie, come out. I don't
want you playing with the Scavo boys.

38:55.417 --> 38:57.583
Mona, please! I'm sure they're clean.

38:59.083 --> 39:02.625
You are not ruining my party.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.500
Porter. Preston. OK, out, out, out.
Come on. Porter. Preston. Let's go.

39:09.583 --> 39:12.041
Not quite yet.
Boys, keep bouncing.

39:12.125 --> 39:14.083
That's right, keep bouncing.

39:14.166 --> 39:19.667
By the way, I spoke to Nurse Abigail.
I know who Patient Zero is.

39:21.542 --> 39:23.625
All right, that's it, kids. Get out.

39:23.750 --> 39:25.333
Out, out, out! Go! Go!

39:26.875 --> 39:28.875
How could you do that?

39:28.959 --> 39:32.333
Look, this party
meant everything to Topher.

39:32.417 --> 39:36.834
I couldn't risk people not showing up.
I had to do something.

39:36.959 --> 39:39.917
And so you let
my kids take the fall?

39:40.000 --> 39:43.208
People were already suspicious.

39:43.291 --> 39:45.458
- Oh, please.
- Yeah, it's true.

39:45.583 --> 39:48.333
Your boys
aren't the cleanest kids on the planet.

39:51.917 --> 39:55.959
- That was not a smart thing to say.
- Where are you going?

39:56.041 --> 39:59.000
I'm going to tell the truth
to every mother out there.

39:59.083 --> 40:02.000
And then I'm gonna take back the bongos.

40:02.083 --> 40:05.834
No, wait! OK, all right.
Look, I was wrong. I admit it.

40:05.959 --> 40:09.917
- I'm really sorry.
- Too little, too late.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.500
OK. I'll... I'll tell everyone
that I was wrong.

40:13.583 --> 40:16.333
That your kids aren't the ones.

40:16.458 --> 40:19.041
Please. I'm begging you.

40:21.333 --> 40:24.208
Well, why are you standing there?
Get to it.

40:37.417 --> 40:39.333
- Bree, hi.
- Hi.

40:39.458 --> 40:41.250
What's up?

40:41.333 --> 40:44.750
Well, I've been doing some thinking.

40:44.834 --> 40:48.333
Rex and I have been members
of the Fairview Country Club for years

40:48.458 --> 40:52.166
and lately it seems
to have lost some of its exclusivity.

40:52.250 --> 40:55.250
And so, I've decided
not to renew our membership.

40:55.333 --> 40:58.917
I'd rather see the money
go to someone I care about.

41:08.875 --> 41:10.875
Bree, I can't take that.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.458
Gaby, this is the way I see it.

41:13.542 --> 41:16.834
Good friends offer to help in a crisis.

41:16.917 --> 41:22.083
Great friends
don't take no for an answer.

41:30.208 --> 41:34.834
We're gonna pay you back every cent.
I promise.

41:34.917 --> 41:36.667
Take your time.

41:43.125 --> 41:47.500
<i>Yes, everyone loves a scandal,</i>

41:47.583 --> 41:50.667
<i>no matter how big or small.</i>

41:55.041 --> 41:57.875
<i>After all,</i>
<i>what could be more entertaining</i>

41:57.959 --> 42:00.917
<i>than watching the downfall</i>
<i>of the high and mighty?</i>

42:05.375 --> 42:07.417
<i>What could be more amusing</i>

42:07.500 --> 42:11.375
<i>than the public exposure</i>
<i>of hypocritical sinners?</i>

42:13.792 --> 42:17.583
<i>Yes, everyone loves a scandal.</i>

42:17.667 --> 42:21.166
<i>And if for some reason</i>
<i>you're not enjoying the latest one...</i>

42:25.083 --> 42:29.041
<i>well, the next one</i>

42:29.125 --> 42:32.166
<i>is always around the corner.</i>
