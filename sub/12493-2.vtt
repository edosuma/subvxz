WEBVTT

00:04.250 --> 00:05.083
- Teddy.
- What?

00:05.166 --> 00:06.250
- Teddy, I've got to talk--
- Oh.

00:06.375 --> 00:08.709
You're kidding.
Then what happened?

00:09.709 --> 00:10.583
Wow.

00:10.667 --> 00:12.041
Oh, hold on. I'm getting another call.

00:16.542 --> 00:17.375
Really?

00:17.875 --> 00:18.875
Really.

00:21.250 --> 00:22.458
Hold on. I gotta call you back.

00:24.083 --> 00:25.125
- What?
- What?

00:25.750 --> 00:27.250
I just opened up the phone bill.

00:27.333 --> 00:29.709
You are $90 over your texting limit.

00:29.792 --> 00:31.083
What have you got to say about that?

00:32.291 --> 00:33.458
I love you, Daddy?

00:34.959 --> 00:37.583
Come on, Teddy, this is so irresponsible.
You know, I expect more from you.

00:37.667 --> 00:39.500
Hold on. I'm getting a text.

00:41.792 --> 00:42.792
No, you're not,

00:42.875 --> 00:44.125
'cause I'm taking your phone away.

00:44.208 --> 00:45.083
Teddy: What?

00:45.166 --> 00:46.125
No, you can't do that.

00:46.208 --> 00:49.041
Taking away my phone would be like
taking away your pizza.

00:53.375 --> 00:55.959
You're fighting for your phone
by calling me fat?

00:59.125 --> 01:00.875
Well, I'm just really mad.

01:02.542 --> 01:03.583
I love you, Daddy?

01:05.625 --> 01:06.542
I'll tell you what...

01:06.625 --> 01:08.792
You'll get your phone back
when you come up with 90 bucks.

01:08.875 --> 01:10.458
What? That's so unfair.

01:10.875 --> 01:11.875
Hey...

01:12.458 --> 01:13.500
Dad. Uh...

01:14.500 --> 01:15.834
I gotta tell you something.

01:15.917 --> 01:16.834
What?

01:19.166 --> 01:20.667
Well, I was pulling into the garage...

01:20.750 --> 01:23.208
and I kind of scraped the bug truck.

01:24.625 --> 01:26.000
Instead of "Bob's Bugs Be Gone",

01:26.083 --> 01:28.750
it now says "Rob's Rugs Be Gone."

01:30.375 --> 01:31.750
- PJ!
- Yeah, Dad?

01:32.542 --> 01:33.834
Try and be more careful.

01:38.166 --> 01:39.208
That's it?

01:39.250 --> 01:42.000
He gets "Try and be more careful"
and I get my phone taken away?

01:42.083 --> 01:43.375
Unbelievable!

01:44.959 --> 01:45.917
Whoa.

01:46.208 --> 01:47.542

Hey, guys, see you later.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.834
- Are you taking Charlie somewhere?
- Yes, to the mall.

02:50.917 --> 02:51.875
We're going to go shopping.

02:52.542 --> 02:53.750
Shopping for what?

02:53.834 --> 02:54.834
Girls.

02:56.417 --> 02:59.000
They just can't resist
our adorable little sister.

02:59.417 --> 03:02.417
I just... I can't believe you'd use
Charlie as girl bait.

03:02.709 --> 03:03.834
Oh, let him do it.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.875
Without charm or personality,

03:06.417 --> 03:07.542
it's his only play.

03:08.959 --> 03:09.834
Thank you.

03:10.667 --> 03:12.166
All right, just have Charlie back by 3:00.

03:12.250 --> 03:14.125
I'm taking her to a birthday
party at Otto's Grotto.

03:14.208 --> 03:16.041
Oh, no problem. Shouldn't take long.
Hey, Charlie...

03:16.542 --> 03:17.834
say that thing I taught you.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.333
Charlie: I wuv PJ.

03:21.125 --> 03:22.333
"Wuv"? She can say "love."

03:22.500 --> 03:23.375
I know...

03:23.458 --> 03:24.917
but "wuv" gets me way more girls.

03:30.875 --> 03:31.792
Hey, honey.

03:32.083 --> 03:33.000
Hey.

03:33.375 --> 03:34.208
What's wrong?

03:34.417 --> 03:36.208
Nobody to play video tennis with.

03:36.792 --> 03:39.917
All my friends are doing homework
or spending time with their families...

03:40.959 --> 03:41.917
Losers.

03:44.166 --> 03:45.250
I'll play with you.

03:46.917 --> 03:48.083
I think I'll go read a book.

03:49.500 --> 03:52.625
You'd rather read a book
than play video games with your mom?

03:54.500 --> 03:55.583
Yeah, you're right.

03:56.041 --> 03:57.625
- I'm gonna go take a nap.
- Oh...

03:58.166 --> 03:59.125
Gabe...

04:00.125 --> 04:03.917
I've played video games before.
I know what I'm doing.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.417
Mom, that's the TV remote.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.333
Which I'm moving out of the way,

04:11.792 --> 04:13.792
so that I can pick up a controller.

04:15.375 --> 04:16.959
All right, serve it up, Sonny boy.

04:17.667 --> 04:18.667
Fine.

04:18.834 --> 04:20.875
This won't be any fun.

04:21.834 --> 04:22.959
Okay, are you ready?

04:23.041 --> 04:23.959
Go for it.

04:31.041 --> 04:33.542
Wow, this might be more fun
than I thought.

04:45.542 --> 04:46.834
Where's Charlie?

04:47.291 --> 04:48.583
Where'd Charlie go?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.291
Teddy: Oh, there she is.

04:52.166 --> 04:53.667
There she is.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.375
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:56.083 --> 04:56.834
Oh, wow.

04:57.417 --> 04:58.834
Maybe we should put that back.

04:59.250 --> 05:00.166
Mine.

05:02.000 --> 05:02.875
Well,

05:02.959 --> 05:04.250
they probably won't miss one ball.

05:04.375 --> 05:06.250
I count every ball every night!

05:09.959 --> 05:11.000
Can you zip me up?

05:12.166 --> 05:13.417
No. No, thank you.

05:14.542 --> 05:16.041
The girl that usually plays the mermaid...

05:16.125 --> 05:17.208
she quit on me.

05:17.375 --> 05:19.458
She's now the Pickle at Hamburger Hank's.

05:20.333 --> 05:21.750
Well, you knew her when.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.000
That Hank is killing me.

05:24.375 --> 05:26.458
With his fancy minimum wage.

05:27.917 --> 05:29.750
I can't believe I'm about
to say this, but...

05:30.250 --> 05:31.750
I could use a job.

05:31.959 --> 05:33.166
Okay, slow it down.

05:34.750 --> 05:37.125
It takes three things
to work at Otto's Grotto.

05:37.208 --> 05:38.041
One...

05:38.125 --> 05:40.083
- you gotta be 16.
- I am.

05:40.166 --> 05:42.125
Two... you gotta be good with kids,

05:42.208 --> 05:44.250
which basically means
willing to clean up their puke.

05:45.458 --> 05:46.375
"I am,"

05:46.458 --> 05:47.959
she said less excitedly.

05:49.542 --> 05:50.750
And most important,

05:50.834 --> 05:53.625
you gotta speak the language of the sea.

05:53.709 --> 05:54.875
The what?

05:55.208 --> 05:56.959
Like "Don't be crabby, kids.

05:57.041 --> 05:59.083
We're gonna have a whale of a time."
Stuff like that.

05:59.166 --> 06:00.208
It's our hook.

06:00.458 --> 06:02.458
Whoa, I just did it again!

06:03.959 --> 06:06.375
Yeah, well, don't worry,
I won't clam up on you.

06:08.083 --> 06:09.417
Well, you'll work on it.

06:10.458 --> 06:12.917
- When can you start?
- The sooner the baiter.

06:14.709 --> 06:16.375
First puke you clean up may be mine.

06:21.458 --> 06:22.417
Okay,

06:23.208 --> 06:24.583
Gabe, what do you think?

06:25.250 --> 06:26.250
Buttoned?

06:26.333 --> 06:27.375
Unbuttoned?

06:27.458 --> 06:28.375
Unbuttoned.

06:28.583 --> 06:30.500
Give those four chest hairs
a chance to breathe.

06:32.417 --> 06:34.041
So, you got a girl coming over?

06:34.125 --> 06:36.750
Yep, her name is Kayla.
I met her at the mall.

06:37.083 --> 06:39.417
- Charlie got you a girl?
- Yeah, worked like a charm.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.625
Well, except Charlie got
a little confused.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.625
Instead of saying "I wuv PJ",
She said, "I wuv poopy."

06:46.792 --> 06:48.375
I think Charlie knew what she was saying.

06:50.208 --> 06:51.709
Yeah, but I totally saved it.

06:52.208 --> 06:54.500
I told Kayla my nickname was Poopy.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.583
Kayla and Poopy.

06:58.709 --> 07:00.375
Many years of happiness, sir.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.542
Come on, boys.
Work your magic.

07:08.750 --> 07:10.000
- Hi Kayla.
- Hi.

07:10.083 --> 07:11.792
- Hi, This is my brother Gabe.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!

07:12.875 --> 07:15.125
Charlie, there's my little sweetie.

07:15.208 --> 07:16.875
Hi. Come here.

07:18.166 --> 07:19.375
- Have fun, poopy.
- Kayla: Oh!

07:20.834 --> 07:21.959
So, uh...

07:23.166 --> 07:24.500
You want to hang out downstairs?

07:24.583 --> 07:26.542
I have an even better idea.

07:26.625 --> 07:30.750
Both: ♪ Ashes, ashes, we all fall down ♪

07:30.959 --> 07:32.875
Oh, my goodness, you're so good.

07:34.625 --> 07:37.083
Okay, who wants to play...

07:37.166 --> 07:38.041
peek-a-boo?

07:38.125 --> 07:39.750
- Who wants to play peek-a-boo?
- Actually,

07:39.834 --> 07:41.291
Charlie has to take her nap right now.

07:41.792 --> 07:42.875
Oh.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.583
Well, guess I'll be going.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Really?

07:46.083 --> 07:48.583
I thought we could have some
Kayla and Poopy time.

07:48.917 --> 07:50.583
Yeah, well, maybe next time,

07:50.667 --> 07:52.542
but this was a really good playdate.

07:53.250 --> 07:54.417
I guess, yeah.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.750
- Bye, Charlie.
- Goodbye-bye.

07:57.834 --> 08:00.000
Who's gonna get a big kiss? I'm going in.

08:01.583 --> 08:03.166
Oh.

08:03.792 --> 08:04.792
Boop!

08:10.834 --> 08:11.709
Ha!

08:11.792 --> 08:12.959
Mom.

08:13.041 --> 08:13.917
Ha!

08:14.000 --> 08:14.959
Dad!

08:15.041 --> 08:15.917
Ha!

08:16.000 --> 08:16.917
Mom.

08:17.000 --> 08:17.875
Ha!

08:17.959 --> 08:19.000
Dad!

08:19.333 --> 08:20.333
Ha!

08:20.458 --> 08:22.333
Can you please make it stop?

08:22.709 --> 08:23.917
What are you doing?

08:24.166 --> 08:25.875
Practicing video tennis.

08:25.959 --> 08:27.250
Gabe crushed me today.

08:27.333 --> 08:29.208
You know, it's about eleven o'clock?

08:29.250 --> 08:30.834
Yeah, well, mama don't like to lose.

08:32.875 --> 08:34.250
Didn't we used to have a lamp here?

08:35.125 --> 08:36.375
I don't think so.

08:38.458 --> 08:40.834
Dad, get her out of here.
I have work tomorrow.

08:41.250 --> 08:42.208
You got a job?

08:42.291 --> 08:45.041
Yeah, I am the puke-cleaning mermaid
at Otto's Grotto.

08:46.458 --> 08:49.166
But of course if you give me my
phone back I can still quit.

08:50.417 --> 08:51.625
Be sure and wear gloves.

08:52.458 --> 08:53.542
Amy: Ha!

08:54.375 --> 08:57.333
- Ha! Ha!
- All right, let's go.

08:57.542 --> 08:59.083
Come on, give me the controller.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.709
Not now. Mama's in the zone.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.625
Yeah, mama doesn't know where the zone is.

09:13.041 --> 09:13.917
Hey.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.792
Oh good. You're right on time.

09:15.875 --> 09:19.250
Yeah, well, it's my first day,
didn't want to leave you floundering.

09:20.917 --> 09:22.458
So where's my mermaid suit?

09:22.834 --> 09:24.417
No, that was for a girls' party.

09:24.625 --> 09:26.625
Today you are working a boys' party.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.417
They don't like mermaids.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.750
All right, so what do they like?

09:34.083 --> 09:37.000
Hey, hey, stop that.
Ollie octopus is not a piñata.

09:37.083 --> 09:38.959
I know. Piñatas are fun.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.083
Okay, guppies, grab your shoes...

09:46.000 --> 09:49.500
or any shoes,
and join your parents outside.

09:53.250 --> 09:54.208
Hey,

09:54.500 --> 09:55.625
lock up for me, will you?

09:56.041 --> 09:57.166
Wait, what?

09:57.250 --> 09:58.917
And don't forget to count the balls.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.166
All right, you heard the man.
Everybody out.

10:03.917 --> 10:05.291
Na, na!

10:15.542 --> 10:16.959
Na, na!

10:17.041 --> 10:19.125
Just wait till I get my tentacles on you.

10:31.750 --> 10:33.125
Hey, I'm stuck.

10:35.792 --> 10:37.750
Could you help me?

10:38.041 --> 10:39.542
No.

10:42.375 --> 10:43.417
Hello?

10:44.208 --> 10:45.250
Anybody?

10:47.667 --> 10:48.542
Kelp.

10:55.333 --> 10:57.000
Oh! I'm getting better, aren't I?

10:58.458 --> 10:59.375
Yeah, Mom.

10:59.917 --> 11:01.875
That time you only lost 6-1.

11:04.750 --> 11:07.250
Hey, hey, excuse me, what are you doing?

11:07.542 --> 11:09.458
I have to study for my
history test tomorrow.

11:09.834 --> 11:12.291
Put that book down
and pick up the controller.

11:15.834 --> 11:18.208
Dad, Mom won't let me do my homework.

11:18.250 --> 11:19.917
You can do it when you finish playing.

11:20.792 --> 11:22.875
I am so confused.

11:25.250 --> 11:26.250
Fine. You know what?

11:27.250 --> 11:28.792
Finish your stupid homework.

11:28.875 --> 11:30.500
Call me when you get
your priorities straight.

11:35.083 --> 11:38.041
Dad, Dad, she's out of control.
You have to talk to her.

11:38.333 --> 11:41.166
Why? Because when I tell her
to do things, she does them?

11:42.417 --> 11:45.583
Haven't you been paying attention
to the way things work around here?

11:45.834 --> 11:47.458
Well, what am I supposed to do?

11:47.959 --> 11:50.917
Well, it's easy. Next time you play her,
you let her win.

11:52.166 --> 11:53.500
Let her win?

11:53.875 --> 11:57.250
Have you ever seen her play?
I'm not even sure that's possible.

11:58.375 --> 11:59.834
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

12:00.458 --> 12:01.375
All right, come on.

12:01.750 --> 12:03.125
Get over there and study for your test.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.834
Oh, I made that test up
just to get rid of her.

12:07.125 --> 12:08.333
- You want to play?
- Yeah, sure.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.917
Hey, Kayla. Are we going on a picnic?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.583
Yes, we are.

12:18.667 --> 12:20.500
I have animal crackers, juice boxes

12:20.583 --> 12:23.375
and PB&J sandwiches
cut into the shapes of stars.

12:24.834 --> 12:26.333
Wow, all my favorites.

12:27.458 --> 12:29.417
No, I brought them for Charlie, silly.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.542
Well, Charlie's not here.
My mom took her to the playground.

12:33.792 --> 12:34.750
Oh.

12:36.625 --> 12:37.834
Well, let's go meet them there.

12:38.375 --> 12:39.458
You know what?

12:40.125 --> 12:42.792
I'm starting to think that you'd rather
spend time with Charlie than with me.

12:43.583 --> 12:44.709
What?

12:46.041 --> 12:47.375
That's crazy.

12:47.458 --> 12:49.458
Are you really jealous of a two-year-old?

12:49.542 --> 12:53.834
How could a hot guy like you
be so insecure?

12:55.750 --> 12:57.500
- Okay, I'm feeling a little better.
- Yeah.

12:58.583 --> 13:00.083
The "hot guy" part really helped.

13:03.291 --> 13:04.917
Hello?

13:05.166 --> 13:06.083
Teddy!

13:06.458 --> 13:07.625
In here.

13:10.792 --> 13:11.709
What...

13:15.333 --> 13:16.291
So...

13:16.792 --> 13:18.041
how was your first day?

13:20.375 --> 13:21.959
Get me out of here. I'm stuck.

13:22.041 --> 13:23.458
Okay, all right.

13:24.250 --> 13:26.333
Don't worry. I'm coming in after you.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.625
Oh, man.

13:34.959 --> 13:35.959
Wow.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.667
You know, if I had unlimited texting,
this wouldn't have happened.

13:42.500 --> 13:43.375
Okay...

13:44.125 --> 13:45.750
I'm gonna try and push you out, okay?

13:48.625 --> 13:50.542
Now, try pulling.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.667
Wow, you know what?
You're really wedged in there, Teddy.

13:57.500 --> 13:58.542
All right, okay, I'm gonna...

13:58.959 --> 14:00.250
I'm gonna go for help.

14:08.542 --> 14:09.625
Uh-oh.

14:15.458 --> 14:17.750
Well, another good shot, Mom.

14:18.667 --> 14:21.333
Is that a bell I hear?
'Cause you just got schooled.

14:23.125 --> 14:25.875
- Are you trash-talking me?
- What's the matter? Can't take it?

14:25.959 --> 14:27.959
Gonna run home crying to your mommy?

14:30.875 --> 14:33.125
You are my mommy.

14:33.625 --> 14:36.208
And you are my loser!

14:38.625 --> 14:40.375
That's it. That's it, Mom.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.959
Now I'm playing for real.

14:42.041 --> 14:44.333
- Let's do this.
- Okay, let's to this.

14:52.875 --> 14:54.250
Where did you learn how to do that?

14:54.333 --> 14:56.542
Ah! I found some cheats on the Internet.

14:56.792 --> 14:58.417
Didn't think I knew about cheats, did ya?

14:58.500 --> 15:00.333
I didn't think you knew
about the Internet.

15:04.250 --> 15:05.458
Dad,

15:05.542 --> 15:07.458
why are you banging
your butt against the tube?

15:07.875 --> 15:09.375
I'm trying to butt-dial the house.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.500
It's number one on the speed-dial, so...

15:11.583 --> 15:12.959
it should be easy.

15:16.625 --> 15:17.875
Ralph: Ralph's pizza.

15:18.041 --> 15:20.333
You want your usual, Bobby?

15:20.500 --> 15:22.291
House is on speed-dial two.

15:29.709 --> 15:31.166
Mom, phone.

15:31.542 --> 15:32.583
You get it.

15:32.667 --> 15:33.959
No, you get it.

15:40.458 --> 15:42.041
Hi-yo.

15:42.291 --> 15:43.583
Charlie,

15:43.667 --> 15:45.125
Charlie, it's Daddy, honey. Listen.

15:45.208 --> 15:47.917
Go tell your mother we're stuck in a tube
at that kids' place at the mall.

15:48.333 --> 15:49.667
What's the name of this place?

15:49.750 --> 15:50.792
Dad, she's two.

15:51.583 --> 15:52.542
Good point.

15:53.166 --> 15:54.083
Charlie,

15:54.166 --> 15:55.417
go get your mommy.

15:56.417 --> 15:57.500
Bye-bye.

16:02.834 --> 16:04.041
Good going, Dad.

16:04.375 --> 16:05.792
I'm not the one who got stuck in a tube.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.542
Well, I'm not the first one anyway.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.917
No, this is all your fault.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.583
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't even need this stupid job.

16:16.667 --> 16:18.750
Hey, you're the one who went over
her texting minutes.

16:19.542 --> 16:21.417
Actions do have consequences.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.959
Uh, not for PJ.

16:23.041 --> 16:25.250
It's like you hold me
to a totally different standard.

16:25.500 --> 16:26.417
Yeah,

16:26.500 --> 16:27.792
I treat you differently.

16:27.875 --> 16:29.000
But why?

16:29.125 --> 16:30.667
Look, Teddy.

16:30.750 --> 16:33.458
This isn't about PJ This is about you.

16:33.667 --> 16:36.750
I have high expectations,
that's why I'm tough on you.

16:37.125 --> 16:38.583
Dad, that's not fair.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.959
Oh, honey, look,

16:41.208 --> 16:45.375
I hold you to a high standard
because you are capable of great things.

16:46.125 --> 16:47.250
I am?

16:47.500 --> 16:48.333
Well,

16:49.000 --> 16:50.250
in the future.

16:51.166 --> 16:54.834
Today, you were defeated by an octopus
costume and a plastic tube.

16:57.959 --> 16:59.083
Thanks, Daddy.

17:02.333 --> 17:03.375
What was that?

17:03.458 --> 17:05.417
That sounded like...

17:05.792 --> 17:06.750
Whoa!

17:08.000 --> 17:10.500
Ow!

17:21.250 --> 17:22.917
How long have you two been down here?

17:23.041 --> 17:24.041
Both: Quiet!

17:25.250 --> 17:26.542
I tried calling the house.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.125
In case anyone is interested, it was an...

17:28.917 --> 17:30.000
emergency.

17:33.458 --> 17:34.834
And that!

17:36.417 --> 17:38.709
- No, no, no!
- What happened?

17:38.875 --> 17:39.875
Oh, this?

17:40.375 --> 17:41.917
This is for your own good.

17:43.083 --> 17:45.000
Well, we've been playing for six hours.

17:45.083 --> 17:46.208
I was about to win.

17:46.291 --> 17:48.375
I was about to win.

17:48.458 --> 17:51.458
Well, now we'll never know,
because I'm taking this...

17:52.083 --> 17:53.834
and putting it on a high shelf.

18:10.041 --> 18:11.000
I don't know, man.

18:12.166 --> 18:14.709
Maybe he's right.
Maybe we did get a little crazy.

18:18.041 --> 18:18.875
Yeah.

18:19.750 --> 18:20.834
You know my friend Jake?

18:21.333 --> 18:22.583
He has the same game at his house.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.542
Oh, nah. It's really late.

18:25.458 --> 18:26.875
I know where they hide the spare key.

18:26.959 --> 18:28.083
Meet you in the car.

18:36.917 --> 18:38.458
Hey, Kayla, it's PJ.

18:38.542 --> 18:40.458
It's, like, my fifth message.
Where are you?

18:40.750 --> 18:42.417
- She's in the kitchen.
- What?

18:49.625 --> 18:51.083
What is going on in here?

18:52.375 --> 18:53.709
I can explain.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.000
- Poopy, I--
- Don't you "Poopy" me.

18:56.250 --> 18:57.792
You know, it's not what it looks like.

18:57.875 --> 18:58.792
- Kayla: It's--
- Really?

18:59.250 --> 19:02.709
Because it looks like...
you're having a playdate behind my back.

19:02.792 --> 19:04.625
I'm sorry, but it's...

19:05.250 --> 19:07.542
Charlie is so cute,
and then one thing led to another--

19:07.625 --> 19:09.500
No, I think it would be best
for everyone if you left.

19:10.125 --> 19:11.000
Charlie!

19:11.458 --> 19:12.542
Don't let him do this.

19:12.625 --> 19:13.709
Say something.

19:13.792 --> 19:14.917
Bye-bye.

19:25.917 --> 19:26.792
How could you?

19:27.458 --> 19:28.667
I sorry.

19:31.208 --> 19:32.792
Oh, I can't stay mad at you.

19:33.583 --> 19:35.458
Charlie: I wuv PJ.

19:36.125 --> 19:37.875
Save it for the mall.
We're going back tomorrow.

19:43.458 --> 19:44.458
Hey, Charlie,

19:44.959 --> 19:45.875
It's your dad here.

19:45.959 --> 19:48.625
I'm filling in for Teddy because
she's getting ready for her new job.

19:49.166 --> 19:51.458
She's working over
at Hamburger Hank's now, so...

19:51.834 --> 19:54.083
no more silly octopus costumes for her.

19:55.333 --> 19:57.041
Teddy: Dad, I'm ready. Can we go?

19:57.125 --> 19:58.291
You, uh, wanna...

19:58.375 --> 19:59.750
say something to your little sister?

19:59.834 --> 20:01.709
No, no. Oh Dad...

20:04.834 --> 20:06.625
Don't ever go over your texting limit

20:06.709 --> 20:08.417
unless you wanna end up like me...

20:08.834 --> 20:10.166
A dancing hot dog.

20:20.375 --> 20:21.417
Good luck, Charlie.

20:24.417 --> 20:25.417
What she said.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.542
What are you doing here?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.500
I'm missing a few things.

20:36.917 --> 20:38.834
The ball pit was a little light.

20:39.458 --> 20:40.458
You really count?

20:40.542 --> 20:42.500
Yes, I really count.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.458
You don't become the number four
kids' entertainment purveyor.

20:45.542 --> 20:48.041
in the Denver Metro area without counting!

20:52.208 --> 20:54.375
All right, well, we don't have any balls.

20:54.750 --> 20:55.667
Oh, really?

20:56.291 --> 20:59.875
'Cause, see, I noticed that your
little sister had some sticky fingers.

21:00.917 --> 21:02.041
Fine. I'll ask.

21:03.875 --> 21:05.083
Teddy: Charlie!

21:06.125 --> 21:08.667
Do you know anything
about some missing balls?

21:43.959 --> 21:44.834
Is that it, Charlie?
