00:10.020 --> 00:14.210
Tonight, a BMW i8 at full chat
in the Yorkshire Moors...

00:14.260 --> 00:16.930
the cream of Hollywood
on our track...

00:16.980 --> 00:20.180
and a pointless thing
about old Land Rovers.

00:26.580 --> 00:30.660
Thank you, everybody, thank
you! Thank you so much.

00:31.820 --> 00:34.250
Thank you, and welcome.

00:34.300 --> 00:38.370
Welcome to what is, for the
first time in many years,

00:38.420 --> 00:39.690
an actual car show.

00:39.740 --> 00:44.010
We've packed it with many facts
and a lot of informations.

00:44.060 --> 00:48.530
And we're starting the ball rolling
with this, the Mercedes SLS.

00:48.580 --> 00:50.810
This was one of my favourite cars

00:50.860 --> 00:53.570
and I was very sad when
they stopped making it.

00:53.620 --> 00:56.490
But, happily, there
is now a replacement,

00:56.540 --> 01:00.010
which I haven't been
driving on the track...

01:00.060 --> 01:01.930
because James has.

01:08.020 --> 01:11.210
This is what they've come up with.

01:11.260 --> 01:13.940
It's called the AMG GT.

01:16.300 --> 01:20.700
And it costs between
£97,000 and £120,000.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.290
Now, I have to be entirely
honest with you -

01:29.340 --> 01:32.290
when I woke up this morning and
got out of bed to come and drive

01:32.340 --> 01:35.340
this car, it was with a certain
amount of disquiet.

01:37.660 --> 01:41.090
I've always thought that
AMG Mercedes are a bit -

01:41.140 --> 01:44.060
as my mother would say - unnecessary.

01:46.180 --> 01:49.700
I don't like the
Stormtrooper body kit look.

01:51.860 --> 01:54.650
I don't really like those
pseudo-special forces names

01:54.700 --> 01:56.820
like "SLS" and "Black".

01:58.500 --> 02:00.640
Jeremy likes them a lot.

02:05.340 --> 02:09.650
With this car, however, you sense
that something is different,

02:09.699 --> 02:12.500
that everything's
a bit more grown-up.

02:15.340 --> 02:19.010
See, their last coupe,
the SLS, had a massive,

02:19.060 --> 02:23.250
and again, not entirely
necessary, 6.2-litre V8.

02:23.300 --> 02:26.850
This car also has a V8,
but it's a brand-new one

02:26.900 --> 02:29.570
and it's a much more
modest four litres.

02:29.620 --> 02:31.130
Because of that,

02:31.180 --> 02:35.530
you might expect it to take a little
longer to get from A to B.

02:35.580 --> 02:37.050
However...

02:39.000 --> 02:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:46.060 --> 02:52.610
The 0-60 time in that 6.2-litre
SLS was 3.8 seconds.

02:52.660 --> 02:55.890
On this, the four-litre car, it is...

02:55.940 --> 02:57.570
exactly the same.

02:57.620 --> 03:00.290
The top speeds are almost
exactly the same as well,

03:00.340 --> 03:03.420
both up in the high 190s.

03:07.380 --> 03:08.770
Strewth!

03:08.820 --> 03:13.820
And AMG has achieved this by
using brains to make the brawn.

03:16.900 --> 03:18.850
This car has two turbochargers.

03:18.900 --> 03:22.290
Normally, turbochargers would
be bolted onto the outside of

03:22.340 --> 03:26.410
the engines, but on this car, they
live inside the V of the engine.

03:26.460 --> 03:30.370
What this means is the
engine is more compact,

03:30.420 --> 03:32.820
the turbos are more efficient.

03:34.700 --> 03:39.010
So this car costs £50,000
less than the old SLS,

03:39.060 --> 03:43.420
it uses a lot less fuel and
it still goes just as quickly.

03:44.660 --> 03:48.620
That is what they call on
The Apprentice a "win-win".

03:54.860 --> 03:56.770
And then there's the styling,

03:56.820 --> 04:00.050
which also has a new
level of sophistication,

04:00.100 --> 04:04.340
with an interior that's more James
Bond than Fast And Furious.

04:07.780 --> 04:10.010
On the outside, it's
much the same story.

04:10.060 --> 04:13.250
These doors are perfectly conventional

04:13.300 --> 04:14.730
in and out sort of doors.

04:14.780 --> 04:18.410
They are NOT like those idiotic
gull-wing things you get on the SLS,

04:18.459 --> 04:20.970
which makes it look as if it's
sniffing its own armpits.

04:21.019 --> 04:23.410
This rear spoiler is
actually an option,

04:23.460 --> 04:27.850
but even that, by AMG's
standards, is quite discreet.

04:27.900 --> 04:32.740
In fact, the whole thing is quite
pretty. Quite classic, even.

04:35.740 --> 04:39.970
And now we must move on to
cornering, an activity where

04:40.020 --> 04:43.780
AMG normally scores maximum
points for mentalness.

04:46.260 --> 04:51.370
This is, when all's said and done,
a 503 horsepower rear-wheel drive

04:51.420 --> 04:56.060
muscle car, and that sounds like
a recipe for extreme trickiness.

04:57.460 --> 05:00.570
In fact, you can corner
quickly in this thing,

05:00.620 --> 05:03.220
and without soiling your trousers.

05:04.740 --> 05:08.610
Which, once again, is thanks
to intelligent engineering.

05:08.660 --> 05:11.890
In a normal car, the
engine and the gearbox,

05:11.940 --> 05:15.250
they're just dead weight hanging
in there and they move around a bit

05:15.300 --> 05:18.010
and sort of spoil the balance
as you go round corners.

05:18.060 --> 05:22.090
In this car, the mountings
for all that stuff are active.

05:22.140 --> 05:24.170
So, as you go through a bend,

05:24.220 --> 05:27.620
they stiffen up to keep
all that weight in check.

05:28.460 --> 05:31.930
It's a bit like the way a cat can
walk along the top of a fence

05:31.980 --> 05:34.920
using its tail to keep
itself in balance.

05:36.380 --> 05:38.450
However, if, like Jeremy,

05:38.500 --> 05:43.140
you want to devour your back tyres
in one sitting, you still can.

05:46.340 --> 05:48.010
Yes, thank you!

05:56.300 --> 05:58.290
And then, there's the noise.

05:58.340 --> 06:00.540
Are you ready? Here we go.

06:11.940 --> 06:14.450
I hate it when my prejudices
are demolished,

06:14.500 --> 06:17.170
but this card is giving me the fizz.

06:20.860 --> 06:24.370
What I like most of all is that
the GT is cleverly designed

06:24.420 --> 06:27.250
to be Jekyll and Hyde.

06:27.300 --> 06:29.250
I'm just going to quieten it down.

06:29.300 --> 06:32.490
Turn off the manual change,
the noisy exhaust.

06:32.540 --> 06:37.010
We'll put it back into comfort mode,
comfort suspension... There you go.

06:37.060 --> 06:42.330
When you turn all that off, it turns
into this incredibly civilised,

06:42.380 --> 06:44.580
long-legged cruiser.

06:46.580 --> 06:47.770
I like what they've done.

06:47.820 --> 06:50.970
They've got rid of the Andy McNab
names and all that nonsense

06:51.020 --> 06:54.540
and given us an AMG for grown-ups.

06:56.260 --> 06:59.130
I'm glad I got out
of bed this morning.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.660
It's what I've been saying
for a long time.

07:10.300 --> 07:12.300
So there you go, May.

07:13.060 --> 07:18.010
Ha-ha-ha! I've been saying for
ages, AMG Mercs are brilliant.

07:18.060 --> 07:21.090
Yes, there are couple of massive
problems with this one, though.

07:21.140 --> 07:24.570
~ What?
~ Well, firstly, it reminds me of you.

07:24.620 --> 07:27.290
The second one is that, to be honest,

07:27.340 --> 07:29.330
for not much more than
half the price of this,

07:29.380 --> 07:33.130
you could have a Nissan GT-R,
which, as we have established,

07:33.180 --> 07:36.650
is the finest car in the world.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.850
It's certainly up there,
I will grant you that.

07:38.900 --> 07:41.610
But I'll tell you what we'll do,
we'll sort it out on the track, OK?

07:41.660 --> 07:43.970
We'll see how fast this
one can get round.

07:44.020 --> 07:48.570
That of course means handing it
over to our tame racing driver.

07:48.620 --> 07:56.010
Some say that last week, he won
a BAFTA for Best Original Smell.

07:58.140 --> 08:01.330
And that when he dies, he
thinks he'll go to Devon.

08:03.140 --> 08:05.880
All we know is, he's called The Stig!

08:06.980 --> 08:09.770
And he's... not in the car.

08:09.820 --> 08:14.210
Oh, yes, Stig not happy about
Ricciardo's lap... He's punched him!

08:14.260 --> 08:16.090
He's punched him! That's bad.

08:16.140 --> 08:18.810
He's really not happy
about that fast lap.

08:18.860 --> 08:22.810
He's in the car now, and he's
off. A wheel-spinning start.

08:22.860 --> 08:24.970
Obviously in a furious temper.

08:25.020 --> 08:28.170
503 horsepower thundering
through the light but strong

08:28.220 --> 08:29.730
carbon fibre prop shaft.

08:29.780 --> 08:33.770
Oh, he's vandalised the first corner.
He is really very annoyed.

08:33.820 --> 08:35.490
But he is driving beautifully.

08:35.539 --> 08:40.929
♪ You know I can't
smile without you... ♪

08:40.980 --> 08:44.690
Another slice of the calming
Carpenters there.

08:44.740 --> 08:48.610
Through Chicago, looking very fast
and very controlled. Now Hammerhead.

08:48.660 --> 08:51.690
James says this car can suffer
from snap understeer,

08:51.740 --> 08:53.810
so let's see what happens.

08:53.860 --> 08:56.250
No, not a thing. It's worth
remembering, of course,

08:56.300 --> 08:59.100
that James suffers
from being a moron.

09:01.300 --> 09:04.250
♪.. I feel sad when... ♪

09:04.300 --> 09:06.450
OK, into the Follow Through,

09:06.500 --> 09:08.250
banging up the double clutch gearbox,

09:08.300 --> 09:11.730
letting the perfect balance of
the transaxle layout do its stuff.

09:11.780 --> 09:13.770
Just a stab of brakes past the tyres.

09:13.820 --> 09:17.130
Stig pretending the pedal
is an Australian's face.

09:17.180 --> 09:20.610
Two corners to go... Oh, he's
hot through there but very tidy.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.370
Only Gambon left.

09:22.420 --> 09:25.720
Laser-guided through there,
and across the line!

09:28.900 --> 09:30.900
I have the time here.

09:31.660 --> 09:33.410
Ready?!

09:33.460 --> 09:37.290
It did a 1.17.5.

09:37.340 --> 09:39.410
And that is... Well, look.

09:39.460 --> 09:43.170
That's quicker than the
old SLS Black and, ahem,

09:43.220 --> 09:44.610
quicker than the Nissan GT-R.

09:44.660 --> 09:47.890
Which shows, James, that you don't
know what you're talking about.

09:47.940 --> 09:50.890
Hmm, interesting. Didn't actually
feel like it would be that fast

09:50.940 --> 09:52.450
when I was driving it, to be honest.

09:52.500 --> 09:55.800
No, that's because... yeah,
YOU were driving it.

09:56.300 --> 10:00.930
Right, and now we must do the news.
And we start with big news.

10:00.980 --> 10:03.690
This is the biggest news we've
had in a long time, I would say.

10:03.740 --> 10:08.850
Because Ford, for the very first
time, is making the Mustang

10:08.900 --> 10:12.410
in right-hand drive and will be
bringing it to the UK officially.

10:12.460 --> 10:14.690
You can buy them over
here. There it is.

10:14.740 --> 10:18.610
Two versions - you can have a
four-cylinder EcoBoost for £28,000,

10:18.660 --> 10:21.330
or for £33,000, a five-litre V8.

10:21.380 --> 10:24.130
Mm, the one I want, though,
is the Shelby, the 350...

10:24.180 --> 10:27.930
~ GT, yeah, yeah, yeah.
~ .. or something like that.
It's 520 horsepower V8.

10:27.980 --> 10:30.450
~ That's the one. There it is, look.
~ It looks brilliant.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.810
But you can't, they're not
bringing that one here.

10:32.860 --> 10:35.770
~ They're not selling that one to us.
~ Why?
~ It's going to Canada in a year.

10:35.820 --> 10:37.850
Yeah, I know, but so is
the internet, but that...

10:37.900 --> 10:39.690
But that's not coming
here, no, we can't...

10:39.740 --> 10:41.850
~ Why won't they sell it to us?
~ I don't know.

10:41.900 --> 10:45.650
But you must be very looking forward to a
right-hand drive Mustang, Richard Hammond.

10:45.700 --> 10:48.250
Yeah, you'd think... No, not really.

10:48.300 --> 10:51.010
Because I don't want a
right-hand drive Mustang.

10:51.060 --> 10:54.970
Once it becomes right-hand drive,
it's like it's trying too hard

10:55.020 --> 10:57.690
to be British and sophisticated
and something it's not.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.610
I know what you mean. It's like
when Americans come over here

11:00.660 --> 11:03.050
and start using words like "bloody".

11:03.100 --> 11:05.330
~ Yes!
~ Isn't it?
~ It's exactly that.
~ It is.

11:05.380 --> 11:07.770
And they say, "I'm going
to the bloody pub!"

11:07.820 --> 11:10.770
~ It doesn't sound right. It's the same.
~ Exactly, it is.

11:10.820 --> 11:13.850
Or they say "mate". They try and say
"mate", but it just doesn't work.

11:13.900 --> 11:15.770
Yes, cos they think we're
Crocodile Dundee,

11:15.820 --> 11:18.330
~ cos it's all the same, cos
they haven't got atlases.
~ Yeah.

11:18.380 --> 11:21.090
So that, realistically, should
be called, now it's coming here,

11:21.140 --> 11:23.410
the "Ford Bloody Quid Mate".

11:24.140 --> 11:25.770
Should be its name! Ooh, now...

11:25.820 --> 11:28.250
Can I just do a survey?

11:28.300 --> 11:31.650
How many people here enjoyed the
ambulance film we did last week?

11:31.700 --> 11:33.610
Yes!

11:33.660 --> 11:36.930
OK, you see, the problem we have
is that we've had an electronic

11:36.980 --> 11:42.410
communication from a man called
Mr E36-Man-4000, who says,

11:42.460 --> 11:46.370
"Dear so-called Top Gear, I HATED
your thing on ambulances.

11:46.420 --> 11:48.210
"Why don't you stick to cars?"

11:48.260 --> 11:51.570
Shall we show Mr... What's
he called, Mr Hashtag?

11:51.620 --> 11:53.570
Shall we show him what
this show would be like

11:53.620 --> 11:55.370
if we just talked about cars?

11:55.420 --> 11:57.690
~ Yeah, OK.
~ Yeah, all right.

12:01.380 --> 12:03.610
I tell you what I drove this week...

12:03.660 --> 12:06.820
~ Volkswagen Passat diesel.
~ Did you?
~ Mm.

12:08.980 --> 12:11.120
Surprisingly comfortable.

12:13.700 --> 12:17.130
I also drove an Audi TT.

12:17.180 --> 12:20.180
~ Which is much nicer than you'd think.
~ OK.

12:22.180 --> 12:26.610
Actually, I've been driving the
new Porsche 911 Turbo, which is

12:26.660 --> 12:30.170
very fast but surprisingly quiet.

12:30.220 --> 12:32.380
Oh, is it? Mm-hm.

12:36.340 --> 12:40.770
Um, Aston Martin have built
a new one-off for a Bond film.

12:40.820 --> 12:44.170
~ It's called the DB10.
~ Yeah, mm.
~ Ooh!

12:44.220 --> 12:47.170
~ I don't think much of that, actually.
~ I don't like the way it looks.

12:47.220 --> 12:49.730
~ No, I don't.
~ No, I do.
~ OK.

12:49.780 --> 12:51.610
Erm, Vauxhall...

12:51.660 --> 12:53.930
.. has a new car, the Corsa.

12:54.860 --> 12:57.000
I've got nothing on that.

12:58.380 --> 13:00.810
Shall we give up on car news?

13:00.860 --> 13:02.250
I'm going to take charge again,

13:02.300 --> 13:04.450
because I want to talk about
something else, right?

13:04.500 --> 13:08.130
I want to talk about some
experts who said last week

13:08.180 --> 13:10.890
they wanted to rip up all of Britain's
railway lines and replace

13:10.940 --> 13:14.490
them with motorways that would
then only be used by coaches.

13:14.540 --> 13:17.170
~ And I think that would be a shame.
~ Why would that be a shame?

13:17.220 --> 13:19.210
Because I like having
coaches on motorways.

13:19.260 --> 13:23.250
~ Why?
~ Because you can drive alongside
them and use their Wi-Fi.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.850
Can you?!

13:25.900 --> 13:28.610
You can, honestly! Have you
not done that? It's fabulous.

13:28.660 --> 13:31.170
My kids always say, "Daddy,
Daddy, slow down to 70."

13:31.220 --> 13:33.330
~ I mean, sorry, "Speed up to 70."
~ Yeah.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.090
"Catch the coach, quickly,

13:35.140 --> 13:37.970
"so we can snapchat this
picture of a poo I've done."

13:38.020 --> 13:39.610
They do!

13:39.660 --> 13:43.250
~ So it's like a free roaming Wi-Fi?
~ Exactly! Do it on the way home.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.050
It's incredibly cheap.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.930
Now, a few years ago, we improved
police cars, and last week,

13:47.980 --> 13:50.170
~ we improved ambulances.
~ Yes, we did.

13:50.220 --> 13:54.050
We are now the emergency service
for the emergency services.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.450
Yeah, we are. That's what we are.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.930
Quite a lot of people have written
to us and said, "Right,

13:57.980 --> 14:00.450
"when are you going to
improve fire engines?"

14:00.500 --> 14:02.970
Mm! No, but there's
a... No, actually...

14:03.020 --> 14:05.210
We've looked into this
and there's a problem,

14:05.260 --> 14:07.770
because if you have to build
a vehicle big enough for all

14:07.820 --> 14:11.050
the water you need and pumps
and ladders and buckets

14:11.100 --> 14:15.330
and six burly men, and
women, in Wellingtons,

14:15.380 --> 14:17.810
what you end up with
is a fire engine.

14:17.860 --> 14:20.930
~ Yeah.
~ But, specifically, a British
fire engine. That's important.

14:20.980 --> 14:23.290
Yeah, not one of those stupid
American ones where all

14:23.340 --> 14:25.170
~ the firemen stand on the outside.
~ They do!

14:25.220 --> 14:28.170
So you get there and there's nobody
on board to put the fire out!

14:28.220 --> 14:31.330
Do you know what I like about
the British fire engine?

14:31.380 --> 14:33.780
It says "Dennis" on the front.

14:34.300 --> 14:36.250
Dennis is a reassuring name.

14:36.300 --> 14:40.210
A Dennis would remember
to return your lawn mower.

14:40.260 --> 14:43.970
It is interesting, actually, because American
fire engines have really stupid names.

14:44.020 --> 14:46.170
I've got a picture of an
American fire engine here.

14:46.220 --> 14:48.610
~ Guess what that's called?
~ Fire Engine.

14:48.660 --> 14:51.010
No, it's called The Igniter.

14:51.060 --> 14:53.890
It is!

14:53.940 --> 14:57.570
~ How does...? "I've already got a fire!"
~ Exactly!

14:57.620 --> 14:59.330
It should be called The Extinguisher.

14:59.380 --> 15:02.090
~ They've probably got an ambulance
called The Haemorrhage.
~ Yes.

15:02.140 --> 15:04.330
Right, earlier on, James

15:04.380 --> 15:08.010
had a go at a proper road
test in a one-off car show

15:08.060 --> 15:11.250
~ and now it's my turn.
~ Try not to muck it up.

15:11.300 --> 15:14.930
No, no, no, relax, this is going
to be a blizzard of facts

15:14.980 --> 15:18.650
because I'm going to talk
about the new BMW M3.

15:18.700 --> 15:23.050
It has a smaller engine
than the old model,

15:23.100 --> 15:24.770
three litres rather than four.

15:24.820 --> 15:28.730
It has two fewer cylinders,
but it is turbo-charged,

15:28.780 --> 15:33.690
so you get a little bit more
horsepower and 111 more torques.

15:33.740 --> 15:37.170
That means it's four
seconds a lap faster

15:37.220 --> 15:39.730
round our track than the old car.

15:39.780 --> 15:43.090
And four seconds is a huge
gulf because, remember,

15:43.140 --> 15:46.170
that was already five
seconds a lap faster

15:46.220 --> 15:47.650
round the Ascari track in Spain

15:47.700 --> 15:49.570
than the equivalent
Mercedes and Audi,

15:49.620 --> 15:54.050
so this is properly quick
AND it's more economical,

15:54.100 --> 15:56.370
but, and this is the big one,

15:56.420 --> 15:58.420
is it nicer to drive?

16:04.620 --> 16:07.920
Well, here it is, slithering
about on our track.

16:09.620 --> 16:13.940
Look at that. I mean, that's
just... the M3 signature dish.

16:16.140 --> 16:19.850
But, straightaway, I must tell
you there is a bit of a niggle.

16:19.900 --> 16:22.210
If you stick the tail out

16:22.260 --> 16:26.610
in a corner, which you can,
easily, because it's an M3,

16:26.660 --> 16:30.650
you'll find it very
hard to hold the drift

16:30.700 --> 16:35.300
because the power steering is now
electric rather than hydraulic.

16:38.060 --> 16:39.970
Going round a corner like this

16:40.020 --> 16:43.490
is like wrestling with the tail
of an excitable crocodile.

16:43.540 --> 16:45.730
It's not just hard to hold the slide,

16:45.780 --> 16:49.490
it's also hard to straighten
up again afterwards.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.280
See what I mean?

16:53.460 --> 16:56.050
Now, I admit, in the real world,

16:56.100 --> 16:59.010
this isn't going to be
much of a problem...

16:59.060 --> 17:01.050
ever, if I'm honest.

17:01.100 --> 17:03.810
And anyway, you can solve
it by taking the steering

17:03.860 --> 17:08.970
out of Sport Plus mode and
putting it in Comfort mode.

17:09.020 --> 17:11.160
Then everything is fine.

17:18.220 --> 17:20.089
Oh, yeah!

17:20.140 --> 17:22.210
In fact, everything
is more than fine,

17:22.260 --> 17:26.020
everything is absolutely sublime!

17:31.420 --> 17:34.850
I'm not going to beat about
the bush, this car is...

17:34.900 --> 17:36.170
utterly brilliant.

17:36.220 --> 17:39.370
It's well made, it's
got seating for four,

17:39.420 --> 17:44.010
it's got a decent-sized boot,
it's comfortable, it's quiet,

17:44.060 --> 17:46.730
it's got lots of standard equipment.

17:47.980 --> 17:52.490
In many ways, this car
is like the perfect dog -

17:52.540 --> 17:55.050
it's loyal, it's cute,
it doesn't chase sheep,

17:55.100 --> 17:56.970
it doesn't go wrong all the time

17:57.020 --> 18:00.130
and yet, if a burglar
comes, it has the power

18:00.180 --> 18:02.460
to rip his throat out.

18:04.180 --> 18:07.490
"Look at me! I'm an attack dog now!

18:07.540 --> 18:10.060
"I'm fierce and bitey!"

18:13.900 --> 18:16.210
And that really is that.

18:16.260 --> 18:18.930
It is a fabulous, wonderful car

18:18.980 --> 18:21.610
and if you have £56,000 lying around,

18:21.660 --> 18:24.130
you should buy one immediately.

18:25.580 --> 18:27.250
Or should you?

18:28.020 --> 18:31.010
Because today, we live
in strange times.

18:31.060 --> 18:33.050
Environmental times.

18:33.100 --> 18:37.130
And BMW has another new
car which reflects that.

18:37.180 --> 18:42.060
It's one of the most talked-about
cars in years and this is it.

18:46.060 --> 18:49.490
It's called the i8 and it's a hybrid,

18:49.540 --> 18:52.170
which means it's powered
by an electric motor

18:52.220 --> 18:59.130
and a tiny three cylinder, 1.5 litre,
turbo-charged petrol engine.

18:59.180 --> 19:02.050
That doesn't sound
like much of a recipe.

19:02.100 --> 19:05.410
It sounds like a sort of
glorified Toyota Prius,

19:05.460 --> 19:08.970
but let me give you
the headline figures.

19:09.020 --> 19:12.610
This car does 155mph

19:12.660 --> 19:16.970
and 134 miles to the gallon.

19:17.020 --> 19:20.570
And because it's so economical,

19:20.620 --> 19:23.690
you get a £5,000 grant from
the government if you buy one,

19:23.740 --> 19:26.370
it's exempt from the
London Congestion Charge

19:26.420 --> 19:29.090
and the road-tax bill,
as you can see here, is...

19:29.140 --> 19:30.340
nil.

19:33.740 --> 19:34.930
It really does sound, then,

19:34.980 --> 19:39.610
like this car answers everyone's
prayers, but does it?

19:39.660 --> 19:43.370
Are pure-bred petrolheads
like me really going to say,

19:43.420 --> 19:48.620
"Mm, yes, what I really want next
is a three-cylinder hybrid?"

19:50.180 --> 19:53.370
Well, that is what I'm
going to try and find out.

19:53.420 --> 19:56.570
I'm going to set the satellite
navigation for Whitby

19:56.620 --> 19:59.610
in North Yorkshire and, obviously,
in a car as futuristic as this,

19:59.660 --> 20:01.610
you don't push buttons to do that,

20:01.660 --> 20:04.690
you trace the letters you
want on this pad here,

20:04.740 --> 20:06.820
so, wuh...

20:08.420 --> 20:09.820
.. huh...

20:10.900 --> 20:11.970
.. ih...

20:12.020 --> 20:13.580
tuh...

20:14.580 --> 20:17.170
Ah-ha! OK.

20:17.220 --> 20:20.810
'Whitby, North Yorkshire,
guidance started.'

20:20.860 --> 20:23.650
Now, the reason I've
chosen Whitby is,

20:23.700 --> 20:26.450
A, you get the best fish and
chips and the world there

20:26.500 --> 20:30.650
and, B, the M3 we saw earlier
is waiting for me there,

20:30.700 --> 20:35.090
which means, when I arrive,
I will face a simple choice.

20:35.140 --> 20:38.900
Will I want to drive
home in that or this?

20:42.500 --> 20:46.010
With the sat nav looking for the
most economical route to Whitby,

20:46.060 --> 20:48.330
I put my sensible head
on and settled down

20:48.380 --> 20:51.940
for a 200 mile fact-finding mission.

20:54.340 --> 20:58.370
You have a choice of
three driving modes.

20:58.420 --> 21:00.410
Number one, electric drive.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.850
That's the electric motor only.

21:02.900 --> 21:07.650
It gives you a range of 20 miles,
19 more than you get from a Prius

21:07.700 --> 21:11.180
and probably enough for you
to do your morning commute.

21:12.580 --> 21:14.530
Then, if you move the
gear lever over here,

21:14.580 --> 21:17.890
you engage sport mode and that
means the electric motor

21:17.940 --> 21:22.330
and the petrol engine are working
together to give 352 horsepower

21:22.380 --> 21:26.620
and it makes the car sort of
firm and bitey and Nurburgringy.

21:29.620 --> 21:34.780
But, since we are on the A1,
I shall go for... comfort mode.

21:36.460 --> 21:37.800
Lovely.

21:38.540 --> 21:41.490
'And it really was lovely.'

21:41.540 --> 21:45.050
I know there is an electric
motor in the front,

21:45.100 --> 21:49.010
driving the front wheels through
a two-speed automatic gearbox.

21:49.060 --> 21:51.730
I know there's a petrol
engine at the back,

21:51.780 --> 21:55.210
driving the rear wheels through
a six-speed automatic gearbox.

21:55.260 --> 21:59.770
I also know there is another small
electric motor at the back,

21:59.820 --> 22:03.340
filling in the gaps and doing
all sorts of clever things.

22:04.420 --> 22:06.930
And yet, sitting here,

22:06.980 --> 22:12.770
this car feels no weirder
to drive than that...

22:12.820 --> 22:16.450
whatever it is, that
hatchback thing there.

22:16.500 --> 22:19.410
I've got a steering wheel,
gear lever, accelerator,

22:19.460 --> 22:23.010
brake and Ken Bruce on the radio.

22:23.060 --> 22:25.250
How normal is that?!

22:25.300 --> 22:28.890
♪ BBC Radio 2! ♪

22:28.940 --> 22:30.930
But there is a problem.

22:30.980 --> 22:35.250
If you're driving in comfort mode,
you're not really charging up

22:35.300 --> 22:39.300
the batteries and, eventually,
they are going to go flat.

22:40.780 --> 22:43.370
One solution is to
turn off the motorway

22:43.420 --> 22:45.490
and charge them up at the mains,

22:45.540 --> 22:49.500
but, as you're about to see,
this is not to be recommended.

22:58.660 --> 23:01.370
"Connect your vehicle and validate."

23:01.420 --> 23:04.490
Look, I can operate a Hoover!

23:04.540 --> 23:07.370
Oh, this is stupid!

23:07.420 --> 23:12.580
Well, it must... It must be
charging. It's plugged in, so...

23:14.700 --> 23:17.300
I shall go and get a cup of coffee.

23:20.300 --> 23:23.530
While we wait for the batteries
to charge, let me show you

23:23.580 --> 23:26.890
this incredible app that you
can get with your i8, OK?

23:26.940 --> 23:30.250
If I push that, I can
set the air conditioning

23:30.300 --> 23:33.340
so the car is cool when
I get back into it.

23:34.820 --> 23:36.690
How amazing is that?!

23:36.740 --> 23:38.290
If I can also flash the headlights,

23:38.340 --> 23:41.570
so I could find it if I've lost
it in a car park. I can lock it.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.330
I can unlock it.

23:43.380 --> 23:46.610
I don't know why you'd want to
do that remotely, but you can.

23:46.660 --> 23:50.250
I wouldn't be at all surprised
to find a feature on here

23:50.300 --> 23:54.340
that enables the i8 to find
another i8 for a good time.

23:55.540 --> 23:58.130
'After an hour, I
went back to the car

23:58.180 --> 24:01.810
'and found that the charging
point hadn't worked.'

24:01.860 --> 24:08.090
If you had a pure electric car,
you would be completely stuffed,

24:08.140 --> 24:10.810
but this is not a pure electric car.

24:11.860 --> 24:13.400
So I'm not.

24:16.380 --> 24:19.090
I can either drive along
without the batteries

24:19.140 --> 24:23.930
or I can put the gear lever
over here to engage sport mode

24:23.980 --> 24:28.260
and then they are being charged
up as I drive along.

24:30.820 --> 24:33.980
What's more, in sport mode,
the i8 is properly fast.

24:36.300 --> 24:39.330
I scoffed when BMW said they
were going to make a hybrid

24:39.380 --> 24:42.820
that was as fast as a 911 or
a Chevrolet Corvette, but...

24:44.500 --> 24:46.240
.. it really is!

24:47.740 --> 24:50.740
'It's so fast that soon
I was in the North.'

24:52.940 --> 24:56.370
This is Doncaster. This
is where I grew up.

24:56.420 --> 24:59.810
It was a mining town
back then, but now look.

24:59.860 --> 25:01.860
It's a wind farm.

25:03.260 --> 25:07.340
Bit less romantic, the windmills,
and they employ fewer people, but...

25:09.020 --> 25:11.100
Time moves on, I guess.

25:12.420 --> 25:15.450
'So far, then, the i8 had done well.

25:15.500 --> 25:20.010
'But to find out if it could truly
win the heart of the petrol head,

25:20.060 --> 25:22.650
'I turned off the A1 and plunged into

25:22.700 --> 25:25.690
'the beautiful North
Yorkshire Moors.'

25:41.620 --> 25:43.490
So, let's find out.

25:48.580 --> 25:50.850
Oh, God above, this is good!

25:55.580 --> 25:57.620
This is a revelation!

26:06.260 --> 26:09.690
It's the lightness that
staggers you most of all.

26:09.740 --> 26:14.060
It's almost as though I'm steering
using nothing but thought.

26:16.300 --> 26:20.050
And because the heavy battery pack
is located in the middle of the car,

26:20.100 --> 26:25.050
here, low down, it has the
same centre of gravity as...

26:25.100 --> 26:26.740
as a worm!

26:28.380 --> 26:32.850
Couple that to the
four-wheel-drive system and, honestly,

26:32.900 --> 26:37.580
you can go round any corner at
any speed that takes your fancy.

26:39.220 --> 26:43.170
The harder I go, the faster I drive,

26:43.220 --> 26:45.130
the sharper I brake,

26:45.180 --> 26:48.860
the more electricity I'm
making for the batteries.

26:49.940 --> 26:51.850
If you get busted for
speeding in this car,

26:51.900 --> 26:54.330
you get a thank-you letter
from Greenpeace.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.050
And rightly so!

26:57.460 --> 27:00.930
'But before we get carried away
with this environmental stuff,

27:00.980 --> 27:04.660
'there's one important point
we all need to remember.'

27:06.700 --> 27:11.130
I've always had a fundamental
problem with hybrids.

27:11.180 --> 27:12.850
And it's this.

27:13.780 --> 27:16.690
We all know the world
has limited resources

27:16.740 --> 27:20.010
and we must do all we
can to eke them out.

27:20.060 --> 27:21.930
And you're not going to do that

27:21.980 --> 27:26.170
if you drive around in a car that
has, effectively, two engines.

27:26.220 --> 27:29.970
You don't solve the problem
of conspicuous consumption

27:30.020 --> 27:33.490
by using conspicuous consumption.

27:33.540 --> 27:34.970
The thing is, though,

27:35.020 --> 27:38.610
while you have to rape the
world to make a car like that,

27:38.660 --> 27:40.970
the benefits of owning
one for you and I,

27:41.020 --> 27:44.460
in the here and now, are
immense, because that car...

27:45.820 --> 27:47.890
That car is staggering.

27:48.900 --> 27:50.770
It's breathtaking.

27:54.380 --> 27:57.320
It's nearly as
breathtaking as that view.

28:03.580 --> 28:08.130
'With the advert for Yorkshire
over, I got back on the road.'

28:08.180 --> 28:09.730
It is incredible to think

28:09.780 --> 28:15.250
that I'm now cruising into Whitby
in silent electric mode,

28:15.300 --> 28:20.890
using electricity that I made
by driving quickly on the moors.

28:20.940 --> 28:24.130
The message really is very
clear from this car.

28:24.180 --> 28:27.500
If you want to save the
planet, drive fast.

28:37.900 --> 28:42.780
'After a short eco drive through
the pretty fishing port of Whitby...

28:44.860 --> 28:49.660
'.. I arrived in the harbour, where
I faced a very difficult choice.'

28:51.340 --> 28:53.210
Cod or haddock...?

28:55.420 --> 28:56.960
I think cod.

29:00.100 --> 29:03.450
'Then I faced an even
more difficult choice.

29:03.500 --> 29:06.780
'Which of these cars would
I drive back to London?'

29:08.380 --> 29:14.290
This is the hardest decision I've
ever had to make between cars, ever.

29:14.340 --> 29:20.290
It's like the M3 is the best
of where we've come from

29:20.340 --> 29:24.610
and the i8 is where going.

29:24.660 --> 29:28.010
There must have been
a moment in history...

29:28.060 --> 29:29.850
when everybody had typewriters

29:29.900 --> 29:32.690
and typewriters had been
around hundreds of years

29:32.740 --> 29:36.570
and they were brilliant, and then
somebody came along with a laptop.

29:36.620 --> 29:39.020
That is what's going on there.

29:45.260 --> 29:47.460
No, I've made my mind up.

29:59.380 --> 30:01.850
Bet you weren't expecting that!

30:15.340 --> 30:18.010
~ What?
~ Hold on, hold on, hold on.

30:18.060 --> 30:20.090
Let me make sure I got this straight.

30:20.140 --> 30:23.290
~ You, let's be honest,
are our resident dinosaur.
~ I am.

30:23.340 --> 30:25.930
And you prefer the i8 to the M3?

30:25.980 --> 30:29.330
~ No.
~ But in the film...
~ Yes, I know.

30:29.380 --> 30:30.850
I was wrong.

30:30.900 --> 30:34.130
The thing is, I've had some time
to do some thinking since then

30:34.180 --> 30:36.330
and there are one or two
bits and bobs on the i8

30:36.380 --> 30:37.570
that would drive you mad.

30:37.620 --> 30:39.290
I mean, rear visibility is atrocious,

30:39.340 --> 30:42.210
the boot is microscopic, this window
doesn't go all the way down,

30:42.260 --> 30:44.770
so you can't drive along
with your arm hanging out

30:44.820 --> 30:48.290
and I discovered last week that
an i8 has just been bought

30:48.340 --> 30:49.810
by Wayne Rooney.

30:49.860 --> 30:51.890
Oh, no.

30:51.940 --> 30:54.850
~ And it gets worse.
~ How can it get worse than that?

30:54.900 --> 31:00.610
Because, in a laboratory in Munich,
it can do 134 miles to the gallon,

31:00.660 --> 31:03.890
but have a guess how many miles
to the gallon I averaged.

31:03.940 --> 31:05.650
~ 80?
~ No.

31:05.700 --> 31:07.770
~ 79?
~ No!

31:07.820 --> 31:10.770
~ 78?
~ No, James!

31:10.820 --> 31:14.290
I averaged 31 miles to the gallon.

31:14.340 --> 31:17.410
And other i8 owners are reporting
the same sort of thing

31:17.460 --> 31:21.050
and it only has a tiny little
fuel tank, seven gallons,

31:21.100 --> 31:24.010
which means you're going to be
stopping for fuel all the time.

31:24.060 --> 31:26.250
So, when you said, "It's a laptop,"

31:26.300 --> 31:28.850
~ it's one of those really early-days laptops?
~ It is.

31:28.900 --> 31:31.330
They are on the right road,
make no mistake about that,

31:31.380 --> 31:34.170
but they are not there just yet.

31:34.220 --> 31:39.330
So, anyway, let's move on, let's put
a Star In Our Reasonably Priced Car.

31:39.380 --> 31:41.850
Now, my guest tonight was
Jordan Belfort's wife

31:41.900 --> 31:43.290
in The Wolf Of Wall Street,

31:43.340 --> 31:45.650
one of my favourite films
of the modern age.

31:45.700 --> 31:49.570
She is now in a new film and
she's brought along her co-star,

31:49.620 --> 31:52.130
so please welcome Margot Robbie

31:52.180 --> 31:54.610
and a man called Will Smith!

31:57.220 --> 31:59.090
Oh, heavens above!

32:01.300 --> 32:02.850
Look what we've got for you!

32:02.900 --> 32:05.090
Yeah, we got you as well.

32:05.140 --> 32:07.410
~ Good to see you.
~ Good to see you both.

32:07.460 --> 32:09.730
Margot, I'll go round here.

32:12.300 --> 32:13.770
And relax.

32:16.340 --> 32:22.410
~ Have a seat! Have a seat!
~ This is fantastic!

32:22.460 --> 32:24.770
~ Wow!
~ Is it really fantastic?
~ This is great.

32:24.820 --> 32:26.010
Cos I was going to begin

32:26.060 --> 32:28.250
by apologising for
the trailers we have.

32:28.300 --> 32:30.970
~ The trailers! Oh! Those trailers, yeah.
~ They're really nice.

32:31.020 --> 32:35.570
~ You know...
~ Will set his bar very high
with trailers, though, so...

32:35.620 --> 32:38.530
~ Really?
~ Yes, his trailer is pimped.

32:38.580 --> 32:40.210
I'm very serious about trailers.

32:40.260 --> 32:42.530
The trailer, you know, it
has to be, like, you know,

32:42.580 --> 32:46.170
you got to hook it up, have a stereo
system, you know, it has to...

32:46.220 --> 32:49.320
Yours had mirrors on
the roof... if I recall.

32:50.980 --> 32:54.570
I'm not insinuating anything,
I'm just saying!

32:54.620 --> 32:56.730
That's going to get in trouble!

32:56.780 --> 32:58.890
That's going to get us
in trouble, there we go!

32:58.940 --> 33:01.810
Already in trouble
where my mind's gone!

33:02.620 --> 33:06.490
~ No, cos really, not that long
ago, you were in Neighbours.
~ Yeah.

33:06.540 --> 33:09.330
What interests me about Neighbours,
which is an Aussie TV...

33:09.380 --> 33:12.090
~ I know what neighbours is!
~ Don't pretend you know.

33:12.140 --> 33:16.290
Two days ago, they asked him
what show I did in Australia,

33:16.340 --> 33:18.810
a very popular show, and
you said it started with C.

33:18.860 --> 33:21.690
~ I couldn't remember the name.
~ There's no C in it.

33:21.740 --> 33:24.130
I just can't see Will Smith
finishing his day going,

33:24.180 --> 33:26.330
"You know what, I think
I'll watch Neighbours."

33:26.380 --> 33:28.210
"Ooh, 6.30, my show's on!"

33:28.260 --> 33:30.170
~ Russell Crowe started in that, didn't he?
~ Mm.

33:30.220 --> 33:33.290
What's his name, Guy Pearce was
another one. Kylie is another one.

33:33.340 --> 33:36.210
~ Yes, yes.
~ I was wondering, do you
know Coronation Street?

33:36.260 --> 33:38.770
~ Cos that's produced...
~ I know all those shows, man!

33:38.820 --> 33:43.090
~ You don't! And you won't because...
~ I got the DVDs and everything!

33:43.140 --> 33:46.250
It's just unbelievable, I'm afraid.

33:46.300 --> 33:49.090
I know all about this,
the Coronation Street

33:49.140 --> 33:50.930
and Neighbours and all those.

33:50.980 --> 33:53.370
EastEnders, yeah.

33:53.420 --> 33:57.490
~ Now, em, you are over here,
obviously, to promote a film.
~ Yes.

33:57.540 --> 34:01.170
It's called Focus, but it isn't
about the small Ford hatchback,

34:01.220 --> 34:05.090
which will have disappointed
some people in here. It's...

34:05.140 --> 34:07.770
Well, it's a love story between
you two, which is rather sweet.

34:07.820 --> 34:11.050
~ Yeah.
~ It's interesting, it's...

34:11.100 --> 34:15.650
My character plays a
conman, a master thief,

34:15.699 --> 34:20.810
and part of being a master
thief is he's a liar and...

34:20.860 --> 34:26.090
he meets Margot's character,
Jess, and falls madly in love

34:26.139 --> 34:30.409
and realises quickly that lying and
loving don't go together too well.

34:30.460 --> 34:34.810
They go together OFTEN, but
they don't go together WELL.

34:34.860 --> 34:38.530
~ I believe we have a clip,
which we can show now.
~ OK.

34:38.580 --> 34:41.570
~ ♪ This is a man's world... ♪
~ Are you working an angle?

34:41.620 --> 34:45.770
~ I wouldn't trust him, if I were you.
~ But I should trust you?

34:45.820 --> 34:50.489
~ You've got a problem.
~ I am going to kill you.
~ Kill me later.

34:50.540 --> 34:54.050
~ You lost everyone's money, my money?!
~ Hey!

34:54.100 --> 34:55.570
~ Wow!
~ Wow!

34:57.420 --> 35:00.170
~ This is your mess.
~ I think you're losing it.
~ Whoa! Whoa!

35:00.220 --> 35:03.570
~ Then why did you come up here?
~ Professional curiosity.

35:03.620 --> 35:06.660
And I like boobs. You know,
I figured it was a win-win.

35:09.340 --> 35:12.460
'At the end of the day,
this is a game of focus.'

35:19.980 --> 35:22.610
Did you notice when I had my shirt
off? You noticed, didn't you?

35:22.660 --> 35:26.170
Did you see that shot? I just want
to know if you saw the shot!

35:26.220 --> 35:28.290
That's what everyone took
away from the trailer.

35:28.340 --> 35:31.010
~ Margot had her trousers off.
~ Oh, yes! You saw that!

35:31.060 --> 35:33.890
~ Slightly more distracting.
~ I get that. I get that.

35:33.940 --> 35:36.770
And I've seen you with no shirt on
a million times, but I've never...

35:36.820 --> 35:39.920
Well, I have seen Margot
with no clothes on.

35:41.460 --> 35:43.460
I've never seen you...

35:44.060 --> 35:47.090
~ This just got awkward.
~ It did.

35:47.140 --> 35:49.290
Now, one of the things that
make it even more awkward

35:49.340 --> 35:53.770
~ is you filmed quite a lot
of the movie in Argentina.
~ Yes. Yeah.

35:55.980 --> 35:58.370
~ How did that go for you?
~ For me?

35:58.420 --> 36:00.610
It was good. It was good, man.

36:00.660 --> 36:03.290
~ Argentina's fantastic.
~ Is it?

36:05.660 --> 36:08.850
~ What's wrong with Argentina?
~ What's wrong with Argentina? What happened?

36:08.900 --> 36:10.840
~ Every
~ BLEEP
~ thing!

36:17.980 --> 36:20.410
The thing is... Well, I enjoyed
it and best of luck with it.

36:20.460 --> 36:22.930
~ Well, thank you, man.
~ When's it open?
~ When does it open?

36:22.980 --> 36:28.370
~ 27th.
~ 27th.
~ February 27th.
~ Is it the 27th here? Yes! OK! Yes.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.050
Now, we've got to get onto cars

36:30.100 --> 36:32.330
because you grew up on
a farm in Australia,

36:32.380 --> 36:36.090
so you, presumably, have been
driving since you were naught

36:36.140 --> 36:37.930
because it's such a vast area.

36:37.980 --> 36:40.810
Yeah, it's huge, but, yeah,
in our family, the rule was

36:40.860 --> 36:43.490
you could drive as soon as
you could like, you know,

36:43.540 --> 36:44.970
physically reach the pedals

36:45.020 --> 36:48.730
and you could have the car on your
own when you reached double digits,

36:48.780 --> 36:52.050
~ so when you were ten, you were allowed to...
~ Wow.

36:52.100 --> 36:54.450
And I remember being nine years old

36:54.500 --> 36:57.890
and arguing with the parents, being
like, "Guys, this is absurd.

36:57.940 --> 37:00.250
"I'm not like..." And they're
like, "No, you're nine.

37:00.300 --> 37:02.810
"You have to wait another year."
And I was like, "This is...

37:02.860 --> 37:04.970
"I can't believe this.
This is ridiculous."

37:05.020 --> 37:07.850
~ Have you been out to the outback?
~ The out... No, no, no.

37:07.900 --> 37:10.010
I feel like you'd fit right
in. You'd just love it.

37:10.060 --> 37:12.930
So it's a racial thing?
You went racial.

37:19.580 --> 37:21.210
And, so, what was your first car?

37:21.260 --> 37:26.850
It was a candy apple-red
IROC Z, a Camaro.

37:26.900 --> 37:29.250
~ Apparently you don't have those here.
~ No, we don't. No.

37:29.300 --> 37:31.900
We have... What's the word? Taste.

37:34.460 --> 37:37.450
I was thinking, "Maybe this would
indicate you don't know about cars,"

37:37.500 --> 37:39.570
and then I started to look
into some of the lyrics.

37:39.620 --> 37:42.170
~ Are you familiar with the
lyrics of the early songs?
~ Oh, jeez.

37:42.220 --> 37:43.570
I wasn't born.

37:43.620 --> 37:46.930
~ In a song called Gettin' Jiggy Wit It...
~ Yes.

37:46.980 --> 37:49.850
I remember that. Yeah,
I know that one.

37:51.140 --> 37:53.290
I don't recognise that one.

37:53.340 --> 37:55.450
It's got 850is.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.410
850is if you need a lift.

37:57.460 --> 37:59.530
~ Who's the kid in the drop?
~ Who else?

37:59.580 --> 38:02.130
~ Will Smith.
~ Will Smith.

38:02.180 --> 38:04.970
~ Now, drop, I presume, means drop-top.
~ Drop-top, yes.

38:05.020 --> 38:07.420
They never did a drop-top 850.

38:10.220 --> 38:12.220
It's a small problem.

38:14.540 --> 38:16.490
No, no, hold on.

38:16.540 --> 38:19.410
Now, see, he thinks
he knows everything.

38:19.460 --> 38:20.970
He thinks he knows everything.

38:21.020 --> 38:24.860
~ In the United States, we do a
thing where we customise our cars.
~ Yeah.

38:27.620 --> 38:29.730
~ Can I just give you another one?
~ This is brilliant.

38:29.780 --> 38:33.450
Just Cruisin'. The Maestro.
Do you know the next bit?

38:33.500 --> 38:35.050
~ Yes, yes, yes.
~ Nice flow.

38:35.100 --> 38:39.050
~ Nice flow. Hot like nitro.
~ Cool as ice, though.
~ Cool as ice, though.

38:39.100 --> 38:42.330
~ That's a dichotomy.
~ Do you know what a Maestro is?
~ You've got one?

38:42.380 --> 38:43.980
There you go.

38:48.620 --> 38:50.700
Oh, my God.

38:52.260 --> 38:56.620
It is so awkward for me to hear
you say my lyrics like that.

38:58.780 --> 39:02.530
~ I'll bet.
~ No, it's making my eyes water.

39:02.580 --> 39:05.490
We've done enough of this now.
We want to get onto your laps.

39:05.540 --> 39:08.850
~ OK, yeah.
~ How did you enjoy it out there?
~ It was really fun.

39:08.900 --> 39:11.610
~ It was really nerve-racking,
but it was really fun.
~ Was it?
~ Yeah.

39:11.660 --> 39:13.410
~ You...
~ No, it's fantastic.

39:13.460 --> 39:17.090
I've never... You know,
in the United States,

39:17.140 --> 39:19.330
~ the stick is on the other side...
~ Yeah.

39:19.380 --> 39:21.810
.. so having to drive
with the other...

39:21.860 --> 39:24.010
That's an advantage
for you, of course,

39:24.060 --> 39:25.530
because you're used to driving...

39:25.580 --> 39:28.290
~ Which is why he's mentioning it right now.
~ He's already started.

39:28.340 --> 39:30.130
Like, "In case she
beat me on the laps."

39:30.180 --> 39:33.210
~ It's the whole switching the side thing.
~ In case her time was better.

39:33.260 --> 39:36.090
OK. Margot, you went first and...

39:36.140 --> 39:38.610
Well, there was a bit of an off.

39:39.260 --> 39:40.850
Crashed. Yeah.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.330
Who'd like to see Margot...

39:42.380 --> 39:46.370
I said specifically, "Let's not
let Will know that that happened."

39:46.420 --> 39:49.210
Let's have a look. Come on. Let's
play the tape. Margot's off.

39:49.260 --> 39:52.460
Oh, wow, it's Chicago. It's
understeer at Chicago.

39:53.660 --> 39:55.450
~ It's Ian! It's Ian!
~ Oh!

39:55.500 --> 39:58.370
That is Ian the cameraman!

39:58.420 --> 40:01.570
Sorry!

40:01.620 --> 40:03.290
And he's dead!

40:08.340 --> 40:11.450
~ Margot, we have...
~ I am sorry about that.
~ No, relax.

40:11.500 --> 40:13.330
We've got a little present for you.

40:13.380 --> 40:15.890
It's the landing light you hit.

40:15.940 --> 40:19.730
You can take that home as a souvenir
of your trip to Top Gear.

40:19.780 --> 40:22.850
I'm so sorry about that.

40:22.900 --> 40:26.890
~ Right, now, we've got both
your laps to have a look at.
~ OK.
~ Ladies first.

40:26.940 --> 40:29.250
~ Ladies first!
~ So, Margot, let's have a look at your lap.

40:29.300 --> 40:32.040
This is going to end in a fist fight.

40:33.420 --> 40:35.290
Right, here we go.

40:37.300 --> 40:39.050
Good clean, aggressive start.

40:39.100 --> 40:43.490
Up to third. First
corner, first corner.

40:43.540 --> 40:45.770
Let's have a look at this.

40:45.820 --> 40:48.130
~ Good dab of the brakes.
~ It feel so much faster in the car.

40:48.180 --> 40:50.090
Everybody says it, but
the slower you look...

40:50.140 --> 40:53.730
Oh, I don't know. There's a lot of
understeer there. That's ballsy.

40:53.780 --> 40:56.130
Oh, God.

40:56.180 --> 40:58.530
Here we go. Are going to make
it without running over Ian?

40:58.580 --> 41:01.250
Oh, waving to Ian! There's a little
wave there. That was nice.

41:01.300 --> 41:02.650
That was a "Sorry, Ian!"

41:02.700 --> 41:04.890
Big corner, don't brake,
don't brake, don't brake!

41:04.940 --> 41:07.080
Don't brake! Don't brake!

41:08.900 --> 41:12.290
~ You do look like you're
concentrating in there.
~ Yeah.

41:12.340 --> 41:14.650
Trying not to hit anyone
this time round.

41:14.700 --> 41:17.700
This is good. I'm liking
the look of this.

41:19.260 --> 41:21.050
~ Yes.
~ Phew!

41:21.100 --> 41:22.690
Right, coming up to the fastest bit.

41:22.740 --> 41:25.460
Foot down, foot down, foot down!

41:27.020 --> 41:30.860
~ Confidence, that was. That
was the look of confidence.
~ Great face.

41:31.860 --> 41:36.370
~ Through the tyres. Yes.
That does look quick.
~ Very aggressive.

41:36.420 --> 41:37.970
That was the fun one. I liked that.

41:38.020 --> 41:40.810
Second-to-last corner, this is
what normally catches people out.

41:40.860 --> 41:44.250
~ Yeah, that's the one.
~ Through there easily. Through Gambon.

41:44.300 --> 41:47.010
More understeer! A lot of understeer

41:47.060 --> 41:49.660
and across the line! There we are.

41:50.820 --> 41:53.450
That was very good.

41:53.500 --> 41:55.040
And, now...

41:56.700 --> 42:00.210
~ That was strong.
~ It is strong, Mr Will Smith.

42:00.260 --> 42:02.210
Yeah, no, but it was on the left.

42:02.260 --> 42:04.930
~ For me, I'm used to driving...
~ Yeah, yeah. Any more?

42:04.980 --> 42:07.850
I had back surgery
like three days ago.

42:11.540 --> 42:13.210
Who'd like to see the lap

42:13.260 --> 42:16.560
with the poor man with
the back surgery himself?

42:18.740 --> 42:21.140
Let's have a look. Here we go.

42:21.700 --> 42:23.840
Whoa! That was some revs!

42:25.860 --> 42:30.010
~ Yep.
~ Whoo!

42:30.060 --> 42:32.890
~ Right, this is the one.
~ Did you do a few practices?
~ Yeah.

42:32.940 --> 42:35.090
Yeah, I did a few practice laps.

42:35.140 --> 42:37.490
That's a hard bit of braking
mid-corner, there.

42:37.540 --> 42:40.580
I tell you what, though, that
car - Bubba GM's finest.

42:42.300 --> 42:45.290
Put that power into the
road. Feeling good.

42:45.340 --> 42:51.210
There we go. This is the spiritual
successor of the IROC Z.

42:51.260 --> 42:54.010
I'm on the wall now. They're
putting me on the wall.

42:54.060 --> 42:59.450
My name with all of the fastest
times on this track.

42:59.500 --> 43:01.450
That is a confident man right there.

43:01.500 --> 43:04.290
It's actually lovely conditions
for a fast time, this.

43:04.340 --> 43:06.810
Keeping it in the lines nicely.

43:08.060 --> 43:11.810
Yes. It's just like watching
Daniel Ricciardo all over again.

43:11.860 --> 43:16.450
This is the one that
makes my children proud.

43:16.500 --> 43:18.650
Keep it in there. No
braking. Flat out. Yeah?

43:18.700 --> 43:21.170
~ No braking. Flat out.
~ Good man.

43:24.340 --> 43:26.410
Yep. That's looking very tidy.

43:26.460 --> 43:29.330
Second-to-last corner,
you have any problems?

43:29.380 --> 43:31.610
No, that is neat. Very neat.

43:31.660 --> 43:33.770
And through Gambon.

43:33.820 --> 43:36.130
Still on all four wheels,
unlike some people,

43:36.180 --> 43:39.090
~ and there we are. Across the line.
~ Whoa!

43:39.140 --> 43:41.970
~ That was nice.
~ That was so much fun.

43:42.020 --> 43:44.610
~ Yeah.
~ Well done, you two.

43:44.660 --> 43:49.130
Where do you think you've
come on the board?

43:49.180 --> 43:52.210
I'll be really psyched if I get
on the board, to be honest.

43:52.260 --> 43:54.730
You can't not be on the
it, because, trust me,

43:54.780 --> 43:56.650
Jack Whitehall, Ed Sheeran...

43:56.700 --> 43:59.450
So there's space down there
for me? OK. I want 1:52.

43:59.500 --> 44:02.340
1:52, and Will?

44:03.820 --> 44:05.960
Well, I want, like, 1:22.

44:09.660 --> 44:13.850
~ Oh, you're asking what I think I did?
~ Yeah, yeah.

44:13.900 --> 44:18.170
I think I might be in the 1:50 zone.

44:18.220 --> 44:19.490
Right in there.

44:19.540 --> 44:21.930
~ Somewhere with the Hugh Bonneville...
~ I felt like...

44:21.980 --> 44:24.490
These are wet times. Well,
let's have a look, shall we?

44:24.540 --> 44:27.650
~ Let's have a look. I've got the times here.
~ Oh, jeez. OK.

44:27.700 --> 44:29.930
~ I'm going to did you first, Will.
~ OK.

44:29.980 --> 44:31.610
~ Oh, jeez.
~ This is really exciting.

44:31.660 --> 44:33.770
~ Will Smith...
~ This is very exciting.

44:33.820 --> 44:38.250
~ You did a 1...
~ That's a good start.

44:38.300 --> 44:41.410
~ .. 40...
~ Oh!

44:41.460 --> 44:43.810
~ ..7...
~ Whoa!

44:43.860 --> 44:48.410
~ ..2.
~ OK. Yeah. I'm not mad at that.
~ That is not a very bad time at all.

44:48.460 --> 44:49.690
That puts you...

44:49.740 --> 44:53.330
~ Wow. OK, yeah.
~ That's really great.

44:53.380 --> 44:56.370
I'm not mad at that.
I'm not mad at that.

44:56.420 --> 44:59.570
~ That's not bad.
~ I like that.
~ That is not bad at all.
~ Yeah.

44:59.620 --> 45:04.050
~ And, now, we must get onto your co-star.
~ OK.
~ Oh, God.

45:04.100 --> 45:07.600
If you beat me, this is
your last day on the tour.

45:09.300 --> 45:12.290
I will never work again after this.

45:12.340 --> 45:15.580
It's Leo, Will Smith, and then TV.

45:18.860 --> 45:20.930
Margot Robbie,

45:20.980 --> 45:23.170
~ 1...
~ Oh, good!

45:23.220 --> 45:27.500
~ ..40...
~ What?
~ She'd better not.

45:30.500 --> 45:33.330
~ .. 7...
~ Oh!

45:33.380 --> 45:36.330
She'd better not. She'd better not.

45:36.380 --> 45:38.980
~ .. 1!
~ Oh!
~ Oh!

45:40.820 --> 45:42.820
I'm not making it up.

45:45.340 --> 45:46.810
I'm sorry!

45:52.580 --> 45:54.260
~ Holy
~ BLEEP!

46:02.700 --> 46:05.730
This was a bad idea.
This was a bad idea.

46:05.780 --> 46:07.170
It's like the Academy Awards

46:07.220 --> 46:10.420
where you've got to clap
for the other person.

46:17.300 --> 46:19.810
~ I don't know what to say now.
~ I actually can't believe that.

46:19.860 --> 46:23.570
Both of you have done amazing
times. There was a tenth in it.

46:23.620 --> 46:26.530
Neither of you have got anything
to be ashamed about and it has...

46:26.580 --> 46:29.970
Oh, no! One of us has something
to be ashamed about!

46:30.020 --> 46:33.050
~ I was trying to end on a really high note...
~ No, no.

46:33.100 --> 46:35.090
~ .. coming up with some nice things...
~ Yeah.

46:35.140 --> 46:37.080
.. but you're right.

46:38.380 --> 46:40.490
Ladies and gentlemen, I
think you'll all agree,

46:40.540 --> 46:43.980
this has been an absolute joy.
Will Smith and Margot Robbie.

46:52.300 --> 46:58.090
Right, now we must move
on to some very sad news.

46:58.140 --> 47:02.210
The Land Rover Defender
is going out of production

47:02.260 --> 47:06.730
and our producers thought that that
meant it deserved a fitting obituary

47:06.780 --> 47:10.780
and all we needed for that was
a beach and a rural simpleton.

47:16.300 --> 47:22.290
It's a little known fact that several
of mankind's greatest inventions

47:22.340 --> 47:27.020
have started out as drawings
in the sand on a beach.

47:28.620 --> 47:30.930
Henry Royce of Rolls-Royce fame

47:30.980 --> 47:33.330
made his first sketch
of the Merlin engine,

47:33.380 --> 47:37.050
the incredible motor that powered
the Spitfire and the Lancaster,

47:37.100 --> 47:39.570
in the sand at his local beach.

47:39.620 --> 47:42.770
Norman Woodland, no, I'd
never heard of him either,

47:42.820 --> 47:46.090
was in Miami when he
revolutionised shopping

47:46.140 --> 47:49.740
by drawing the first
barcode in the sand.

47:51.900 --> 47:55.450
And, in 1947, here at Red
Wharf Bay in Anglesey,

47:55.500 --> 47:58.440
it was the same story
for the Land Rover.

48:00.180 --> 48:04.210
The sketch was done by a
chap called Maurice Wilks

48:04.260 --> 48:07.810
who was the Technical
Director for Rover cars.

48:07.860 --> 48:13.330
At the time, he used an old Bren gun
carrier to get around on his farm

48:13.380 --> 48:18.170
until, one day, he swapped it for
his neighbour's old Willys Jeep

48:18.220 --> 48:23.140
and soon thought, "Hang on. We
can make something like this."

48:24.820 --> 48:27.930
So, he sketched out his
creation in the sand

48:27.980 --> 48:32.580
and a first prototype was quickly
built over the following few months.

48:33.660 --> 48:36.660
Sadly, though, there
was a bit of an issue.

48:38.180 --> 48:42.010
You see, Maurice thought putting
the steering wheel in the middle

48:42.060 --> 48:45.810
would mean they could sell it to right-
and left-hand drive countries,

48:45.860 --> 48:48.400
without having to re-engineer it.

48:49.340 --> 48:51.610
But then they realised that,
amongst other things,

48:51.660 --> 48:55.010
that was going to make hand
signals rather tricky.

48:55.060 --> 48:57.800
So, it was back to the drawing board.

48:59.140 --> 49:03.450
And, a mere ten months
after that shaky start,

49:03.500 --> 49:06.660
the first Land Rover was born.

49:11.500 --> 49:13.570
It came in this green

49:13.620 --> 49:16.890
because the only paint Land
Rover could lay their hands on

49:16.940 --> 49:21.010
was surplus army leftovers
they used for Spitfires.

49:21.060 --> 49:25.170
The body was aluminium, not for
clever engineering reasons,

49:25.220 --> 49:28.530
but because steel
was in short supply.

49:28.580 --> 49:31.250
If ever there was an underdog...

49:31.300 --> 49:32.650
it was this.

49:32.700 --> 49:36.290
Nobody back then could have predicted

49:36.340 --> 49:40.060
what a phenomenon the underdog
would turn out to be.

49:41.620 --> 49:44.210
The military bought
it by the thousand,

49:44.260 --> 49:49.290
and it was used by everyone from
the Medical Corps to the SAS,

49:49.340 --> 49:53.970
while in civilian life, it was
the very definition of versatile.

49:54.020 --> 49:56.250
You could have a Land Rover tank,

49:56.300 --> 49:57.770
a Land Rover train,

49:57.820 --> 49:59.450
a Land Rover conveyer belt,

49:59.500 --> 50:01.290
a snowplough,

50:01.340 --> 50:02.690
a fire engine,

50:02.740 --> 50:05.050
and, rather annoyingly...

50:05.100 --> 50:08.140
a Land Rover hovervan.

50:09.700 --> 50:12.490
If explorers wanted to explore,

50:12.540 --> 50:17.410
adventurers wanted to conquer terrain
that was unconquerable...

50:17.460 --> 50:19.730
they turned to one of these.

50:21.780 --> 50:23.890
It was the first production vehicle

50:23.940 --> 50:27.940
to travel 18,000 miles
from England to Singapore.

50:29.380 --> 50:32.420
The first to cross the Bering Strait.

50:33.500 --> 50:36.090
And the machine of choice
for Ranulph Fiennes

50:36.140 --> 50:38.970
on his epic trans-global expedition.

50:39.020 --> 50:41.250
In fact, at one time,

50:41.300 --> 50:47.530
the first car ever seen by 60% of the
developing world was a Land Rover.

50:47.580 --> 50:53.810
And, on top of that, it's been
in production for 67 years.

50:53.860 --> 50:55.970
67 years.

50:56.020 --> 50:59.970
Production run alone makes
this thing one of the greats.

51:00.020 --> 51:04.410
Look at the other icons -
Beetle, I'd say 57 years.

51:04.460 --> 51:09.010
2CV, that was a real
fly-by-night - 42 years.

51:09.060 --> 51:14.650
So great is my love for this
machine that when, 13 years ago,

51:14.700 --> 51:18.130
we ran a Top Gear competition
asking viewers to vote for

51:18.180 --> 51:20.530
the greatest car of all time,

51:20.580 --> 51:22.810
I championed the Land Rover.

51:22.860 --> 51:25.410
And the public clearly agreed.

51:25.460 --> 51:27.130
Because it won.

51:28.500 --> 51:31.010
I drove a Series 1 in that film.

51:31.060 --> 51:34.130
It was old and tatty and worn.

51:34.180 --> 51:38.570
But I fell so completely in love
with it that I actually bought it

51:38.620 --> 51:40.490
so I could restore it.

51:40.540 --> 51:43.530
I'll never forget the day I
brought it home 13 years ago -

51:43.580 --> 51:46.810
it stood in this very
yard like a lost orphan.

51:46.860 --> 51:49.250
So I took it into the
workshop, stripped it down,

51:49.300 --> 51:52.970
and laid it all out on the floor
so I could begin that long,

51:53.020 --> 51:56.850
loving process of restoring
it to its former glory.

51:56.900 --> 51:58.570
And here it is.

52:08.100 --> 52:09.810
Yeah, I mean...

52:09.860 --> 52:12.050
I have been REALLY busy.

52:12.100 --> 52:14.450
And-and the thing is it's...

52:14.500 --> 52:18.450
good to have a lot of spare parts
cos Land Rovers break down a lot,

52:18.500 --> 52:20.810
so you never know.

52:20.860 --> 52:23.960
Can't be too sentimental
about these things.

52:24.380 --> 52:27.770
But because it is the
greatest car ever made,

52:27.820 --> 52:32.860
I must now try to make amends
by giving it a fitting sendoff.

52:34.500 --> 52:37.690
And this is the perfect
starting point.

52:37.740 --> 52:40.650
There are many great
Land Rover TV adverts,

52:40.700 --> 52:44.570
but what you're watching now
is the most famous of them all.

52:44.620 --> 52:49.810
This is the one where it winches
itself up a vast, steep dam.

52:49.860 --> 52:52.250
'Next time you're late for work

52:52.300 --> 52:54.770
'it's worth remembering that nothing

52:54.820 --> 52:58.620
'but nothing gets in the
way of a Land Rover.'

53:02.300 --> 53:04.650
Now, the thing is...

53:04.700 --> 53:08.770
that advert, as exciting as
it looked, was, I'm afraid,

53:08.820 --> 53:11.210
the result of... shall we say,

53:11.260 --> 53:12.970
the magic of television,

53:13.020 --> 53:16.850
because the Land Rover
didn't winch itself up.

53:16.900 --> 53:20.090
The winch on the front bumper
pulled it the first few feet

53:20.140 --> 53:21.890
out of the water,

53:21.940 --> 53:24.770
but then it was actually hauled
the rest of the way up

53:24.820 --> 53:28.140
by a much bigger winch hidden
at the top of the dam.

53:29.300 --> 53:32.930
So I think you can probably
see what's coming next.

53:32.980 --> 53:35.650
As our tribute to the
Land Rover Defender

53:35.700 --> 53:39.220
we are going to redo
that stunt properly.

53:44.100 --> 53:46.220
Oh... God.

53:48.380 --> 53:52.380
The dam I'll be climbing
is Claerwen in Wales.

53:53.420 --> 53:56.210
It's 1,200 feet wide and,

53:56.260 --> 54:00.410
more worryingly for
me, 200 feet high.

54:00.460 --> 54:03.050
To make things worse,

54:03.100 --> 54:06.930
the Land Rover I'll be
using is 64 years old.

54:06.980 --> 54:11.730
So, in order to do what they
never managed in the TV advert,

54:11.780 --> 54:14.260
we've added some bits.

54:16.180 --> 54:19.930
When they made that advert there
wasn't a winch around big enough

54:19.980 --> 54:23.930
to take on board all the cable
you need to go up a big dam.

54:23.980 --> 54:27.210
So we - well, not Jeremy
and me, somebody else -

54:27.260 --> 54:29.700
has built this ginormous one.

54:30.820 --> 54:34.450
Then there's the matter
of the engine.

54:34.500 --> 54:39.650
You see, when this thing starts to
go up the dam it will go vertical,

54:39.700 --> 54:44.010
and at that point the engine
at the front will cut out.

54:44.060 --> 54:47.090
Problem, because we need the
engine to power the winch.

54:47.140 --> 54:49.410
Solution...

54:49.460 --> 54:51.570
a second engine just for the winch.

54:51.620 --> 54:54.530
Best of all this is
built so it can pivot.

54:54.580 --> 54:58.090
As the Land Rover goes
vertical this stays level.

54:58.140 --> 55:02.090
None of this gave me
much comfort, however,

55:02.140 --> 55:04.740
when I was standing at the bottom.

55:05.980 --> 55:07.930
Oh, bloody hell.

55:07.980 --> 55:10.090
It's much steeper

55:10.140 --> 55:13.770
than the other dam in the advert.

55:13.820 --> 55:17.490
For a brief moment I thought
I was off the hook

55:17.540 --> 55:20.730
because the start point looked
completely inaccessible.

55:20.780 --> 55:24.570
Sadly, the producers
had thought of that.

55:24.620 --> 55:26.780
I hate problem solvers.

55:29.660 --> 55:32.530
And this is just a
little amuse-bouche.

55:33.340 --> 55:36.170
Eventually, I was in place.

55:36.220 --> 55:39.540
The winch cable was
attached to the top.

55:42.500 --> 55:45.100
And it was time to begin.

55:46.620 --> 55:50.210
That's the engine in the back
that powers the winch, remember,

55:50.260 --> 55:51.610
cos of the angle.

55:51.660 --> 55:54.730
Um... I'd love to think of
something else to say or do.

55:54.780 --> 55:57.890
I can't, so I'm going
to go. So, um...

55:57.940 --> 55:59.740
Right, here I go.

56:04.500 --> 56:06.570
Oh, it's tensioning up.

56:09.620 --> 56:11.490
This is OK so far.

56:15.300 --> 56:17.940
Oh! There it is.

56:19.860 --> 56:22.250
Oh, my God!

56:22.300 --> 56:26.300
Oh! Oh-ho-ho! Oh!

56:31.540 --> 56:33.650
I know it's slow.

56:33.700 --> 56:37.580
Any faster and I risk burning out
all the winch motors and things.

56:38.740 --> 56:42.380
Plus, there was an issue with
the face of the dam itself.

56:43.860 --> 56:47.570
The one on the advert was smooth
concrete, this is rough stone.

56:47.620 --> 56:50.090
I didn't take that into account.

56:52.300 --> 56:54.850
What I've got to do is
steer between these rocks

56:54.900 --> 56:56.650
where they stick out from the face.

56:56.700 --> 57:00.130
Oh! It's jerking.

57:00.180 --> 57:01.930
I'm having to read the surface.

57:01.980 --> 57:03.850
CLANG! Oh!

57:05.420 --> 57:09.620
This vertical off-roading
gave me another problem.

57:11.260 --> 57:16.290
Because the Land Rover is winching
itself up on its own winch,

57:16.340 --> 57:19.770
the cable has to feed
evenly onto the drum.

57:19.820 --> 57:23.020
If it doesn't do that,
everything gets ruined.

57:23.860 --> 57:29.210
I couldn't see the drum, so, up top,
the producers were spotting for me.

57:29.260 --> 57:31.730
Straighten up, please, Richard.

57:35.460 --> 57:36.930
Ah...

57:36.980 --> 57:38.660
Oh...

57:41.300 --> 57:42.500
Oh...

57:44.940 --> 57:48.210
Because it's so slow I've got time
to think about what would happen if...

57:48.260 --> 57:50.650
I can't, I daren't.
I am now terrified.

57:50.700 --> 57:53.890
I am now absolutely petrified.

57:53.940 --> 57:55.140
Oh...

57:57.860 --> 58:01.740
Past the halfway point it
started to get even worse.

58:03.380 --> 58:06.250
I can feel the front wheels
now going very light...

58:06.300 --> 58:10.850
because... where it goes concave,
where it bellies in like that...

58:10.900 --> 58:14.540
my winch cable is pulling the front
of the car off the ground. Oh!

58:16.100 --> 58:19.200
And I can't tell you
how horrible that feels.

58:19.900 --> 58:22.130
Oh-ho!

58:22.180 --> 58:24.330
Stop, stop, stop.

58:24.380 --> 58:26.650
I'm stopping, I'm stopping.

58:30.780 --> 58:33.610
~ Honestly, mate, you've
got about 20 seconds, I'm
~ BLEEP
~ scared, OK?

58:33.660 --> 58:35.330
And I mean it.

58:36.860 --> 58:40.290
OK, take your mind off it, take
your mind off it. Um... this...

58:40.340 --> 58:42.250
THUMP! Ah!

58:42.300 --> 58:45.170
The water behind this dam
can supply Birmingham

58:45.220 --> 58:48.810
with 79 million gallons a day.

58:48.860 --> 58:50.890
~ Who gives a
~ BLEEP
~ right now?

58:50.940 --> 58:53.210
It's all right, we're good.

58:58.260 --> 59:00.400
It's really vertical now.

59:04.340 --> 59:05.740
Oh, God.

59:07.940 --> 59:09.610
I can hear the lines...

59:09.660 --> 59:12.760
I can actually hear the
tension in that wire.

59:15.980 --> 59:17.530
As I get to the top,

59:17.580 --> 59:19.290
the cable becomes less strong.

59:19.340 --> 59:22.090
Partly because, as well as the
weight of the Land Rover and me,

59:22.140 --> 59:26.140
it has to be carrying the weight
of itself and the winch.

59:31.580 --> 59:35.490
Oh, God, I'm depending so much
on things made by other people.

59:35.540 --> 59:39.730
Every single part now - the brake
that stops the winch feeding out,

59:39.780 --> 59:42.020
the engine - everything.

59:43.620 --> 59:46.250
In the face of unutterable terror

59:46.300 --> 59:49.700
I was, finally, nearing the top.

59:51.660 --> 59:55.060
We have nearly done this,
I've nearly cracked it.

59:55.460 --> 59:57.930
200 feet of near vertical rock.

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:06.620
Just a few inches, another
few turns on the winch.

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:12.730
What a fantastic way...

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:15.090
to pay tribute...

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.970
to the car... What?

01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:22.210
It was at this point the
producers broke the bad news.

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:25.090
Because of where the winch
cable was attached,

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:30.330
the Land Rover wouldn't be able to
climb over onto the flat dam top.

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:33.220
And this meant only one thing.

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:37.820
I'm going to have to go back down.

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:41.460
I'm going to have to
winch it down the dam.

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:46.060
I really need a piss!

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:56.610
Thank you. It was nothing.

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.330
It was nothing.

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:03.210
So... you failed.

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.810
Well, I almost got to the top.

01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:07.250
Yeah, but then you just came
straight back down again.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:10.530
I'm sorry, Hammond, if I said, "I'm
going to drive to Bristol," and then

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:14.570
got NEARLY to Bristol and came home
again, that's NOT going to Bristol.

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:17.490
Look, the main thing is I
gave the Land Rover Defender

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:21.290
~ a fitting sendoff.
~ Yeah, but they're working
on a new Defender now

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:24.210
and it looks EXACTLY
the same as the old one.

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:28.730
So you said you'd drive to the
top of a dam, which you didn't,

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:32.690
to pay tribute to a car that you
said was about to die, but it's not.

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:34.170
Yeah.

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:37.930
Well, that means you're a liar and
you've completely wasted our time.

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:39.610
Yeah.

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:41.770
And on that bombshell, I'm
afraid it's time to end.

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:44.490
Next week normal service is resumed.

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.970
James and I have a lot
of crashes on purpose.

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:50.100
Hopefully we shall see you then.
Thank you for watching, good night!
