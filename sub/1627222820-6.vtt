00:01.293 --> 00:02.878
When I direct a new show,

00:02.878 --> 00:06.215
the hardest part is getting
the actors to trust each other.

00:06.215 --> 00:07.674
I'm doing a podcast.

00:07.674 --> 00:10.969
A true crime podcast about a murder

00:10.969 --> 00:12.638
in our own building.

00:12.638 --> 00:13.764
‐ Are you associated with the deceased?

00:13.764 --> 00:15.557
‐ You're probably just starting
your investigation,

00:15.557 --> 00:18.519
looking into all the forensic‐‐
‐ Goddammit.

00:18.519 --> 00:21.355
If I meet one more true crime nut...

00:21.355 --> 00:23.148
‐ I am onto something great here.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.859
‐ What was it? 32K?
‐ Now, it's 35.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.945
‐ I tend to make packs wherever I go.

00:27.945 --> 00:30.239
When I was a kid,
I had my Hardy Boys pack.

00:30.239 --> 00:33.075
‐ Mabel is a sweet young woman who
promised not to keep secrets from us.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.451
‐ Oh my God! There she is!

00:34.451 --> 00:36.495
‐ It's Tie‐Dye Guy!

00:36.495 --> 00:38.288
‐ I didn't murder Tim Kono.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.624
‐ Tim was murdered?
Damn, he was right.

00:40.624 --> 00:42.334
‐ Tim thought he was gonna get murdered?

00:42.334 --> 00:45.128
‐ He'd been trying to take down this black
market jewelry dealer named Angel.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.589
‐ Tim Kono was a loner
who worked in a bank.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.633
Taking down a black market jewelry dealer

00:49.633 --> 00:51.885
seems a little off‐brand, don't you think?

00:51.885 --> 00:55.264
‐ Maybe... Then again,
I found all these in his apartment.

01:12.656 --> 01:14.658
We're all born alone.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.370
Unless you're a twin or something,

01:18.370 --> 01:20.372
but twins creep me the fuck out.

01:20.372 --> 01:22.374
And don't even get me started on triplets

01:22.374 --> 01:24.793
or quadrupla‐‐
Whatever the fuck they're called.

01:24.793 --> 01:28.046
I don't know 'cause that's
not my point. My point is

01:28.046 --> 01:29.631
we're born alone,

01:29.631 --> 01:31.967
spend most of our time alone,

01:31.967 --> 01:34.970
then we all go out alone.

01:36.305 --> 01:38.932
When I was a kid,
there was this show on TV‐‐

01:38.932 --> 01:41.268
Herman's Head.
You remember this shit?

01:41.268 --> 01:42.978
Herman was this dude who had

01:42.978 --> 01:45.647
these imaginary people
in his head, advising him.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.900
‐ There's no such thing
as love at first sight!

01:47.900 --> 01:51.111
One was the nervous one,
one was the romantic one...

01:51.111 --> 01:54.865
I‐I can't remember all the details,
but I remember the fuck outta that show.

01:54.865 --> 01:57.117
And I liked it 'cause
old Herman wasn't alone.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.494
You know what I mean?
He had these people in his head.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.334
For a long time, I played it like Herman.

02:05.334 --> 02:08.962
Just me and the people
advising me in my head.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.381
And then I went and fucked
that up by listening

02:11.381 --> 02:14.927
to that romantic fucker
in my head a little too much.

02:14.927 --> 02:16.345
CHARLES
Hey, podcast listeners.

02:16.345 --> 02:19.306
Here at Only Murders in the Building,
when we get hungry...

02:19.306 --> 02:20.974
Hey.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.810
What you doing? We said
we're doing the nursery together.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.355
‐ I waited. As long as I could.

02:26.355 --> 02:29.149
Perhaps Evelyn the cat's
paw prints meant nothing.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.194
But perhaps they were key to the entire...

02:32.194 --> 02:34.238
‐ Do not subject our unborn child

02:34.238 --> 02:36.740
to this true crime bullshit, please!

02:36.740 --> 02:39.159
‐ This one is cute.
‐ Mm...

02:39.660 --> 02:40.786
‐ I don't get a kiss hello?

02:40.786 --> 02:43.288
‐ Oh, my bad. My bad. I got you.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.749
...can't actually see the color red...

02:45.749 --> 02:47.668
‐ You think I won't smell
that cigarette on you?

02:47.668 --> 02:49.294
‐ Don't start.

02:50.212 --> 02:51.588
I had a dead kid today.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.966
I'm coming to you live from...

02:53.966 --> 02:55.759
‐ A little girl.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.427
Stepfather.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.513
Abuse. All of that.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.182
‐ Alright.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.476
But this shit stops when Kareem comes.

03:04.476 --> 03:06.645
‐ Who the fuck is Kareem?

03:06.645 --> 03:08.730
Not my son.
‐ Kareem Abdul‐Jabbar?

03:08.730 --> 03:11.441
‐ So?
‐ Is an athlete, a scholar,

03:11.441 --> 03:12.901
an activist?

03:12.901 --> 03:16.280
‐ And Kareem Hardison is Dwayne Wayne
on A Different World. I don't care.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.781
‐ Kadeem.
‐ What?

03:17.781 --> 03:18.907
‐ Kadeem Hardison.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.617
‐ That's what I said. It's the same shit.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.452
What are you talking about?

03:23.245 --> 03:26.123
‐ You know, I was hoping you'd be
home in time to help me with this.

03:26.123 --> 03:29.543
‐ Did you not just hear me
tell you about my day today?

03:29.543 --> 03:31.962
‐ Just...

03:31.962 --> 03:35.299
don't end up like Jerguson, Dee. Okay?

03:35.966 --> 03:38.927
That's not who I married.
‐ Alright. Okay.

03:38.927 --> 03:42.139
Howard Morris lives
at the Arconia in apartment 3D,

03:42.139 --> 03:44.850
a place pungent with cat dander.

03:44.850 --> 03:45.934
‐ The Arconia?

03:45.934 --> 03:47.811
But even stronger than the odor

03:47.811 --> 03:50.397
was Howard's rage toward Tim Kono.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.150
‐ What the fuck?
No, I‐I closed that case.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.485
‐ Oh shit, that's you
they're talking about?

03:55.485 --> 03:58.739
‐ What? W‐what the fuck are they saying?
‐ You know what?

03:58.739 --> 04:01.366
Let's just turn it off.
‐ No, that was a suicide,

04:01.366 --> 04:02.868
open and shut.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.662
‐ Okay, but, um, sorry...
What about the paw prints?

04:05.662 --> 04:06.914
Because the cat

04:06.914 --> 04:08.832
that came in after, and th‐they found it.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.918
‐ You fuckin' for real?

04:10.918 --> 04:12.753
So, what?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.630
The cat did it?

04:14.630 --> 04:16.381
No, for real. Let‐let's just‐‐
So, the cat did it?

04:17.758 --> 04:19.468
Why are you listening to this shit?

04:19.468 --> 04:22.513
‐ My Yard Dog Homies were
boosting it on Twitter.

04:22.513 --> 04:23.847
I mean, these guys, they're...

04:24.515 --> 04:27.559
they're dopey, but they
tell the story really well.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.729
‐ Yeah, I don't... I don't tell stories.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.774
And I don't make mistakes on my cases.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.151
‐ Wait, where are you going?
‐ Where do you think?

04:36.151 --> 04:38.153
‐ Dee, come on.
‐ You know...

04:38.820 --> 04:41.823
you didn't have to hit me
with the work shit. Not today.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.293
‐ We continued staring at the jewels

04:53.293 --> 04:55.796
for what felt like a beat too long.

04:56.922 --> 04:58.841
‐ I found them in Tim's apartment.

04:58.841 --> 05:00.843
I went back alone after we left.

05:00.843 --> 05:02.511
‐ You went back without us?

05:02.511 --> 05:04.555
‐ Charles I get, but without me?

05:04.555 --> 05:06.849
‐ I found him this one.

05:06.849 --> 05:09.601
And this one.
These are all from Angel.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.019
‐ Who is Angel?

05:11.019 --> 05:12.688
‐ That's the only name I got.

05:12.688 --> 05:14.648
Kono was obsessed with
buying pieces from Angel.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.277
Sucks Tim died before he
got the one he really wanted.

05:18.277 --> 05:19.820
‐ And which one was that?

05:20.737 --> 05:22.364
‐ Uh, I got a pic somewhere.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.908
He'd been trying to track it
down for years. I can dig it up.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.118
‐ Yes, please,

05:26.118 --> 05:27.870
and text it to me as soon as you find it.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.288
‐ Me, too.
‐ Me, three!

05:29.288 --> 05:30.330
‐ Just me.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.875
‐ You know, I hooked Tim up
with my jewelry connection,

05:32.875 --> 05:34.877
Cutter, to talk about
that piece he wanted.

05:34.877 --> 05:36.336
‐ Oh my God!

05:36.336 --> 05:39.047
The twists and turns of this
are just unbelievable.

05:39.047 --> 05:42.092
It's like a‐a rainbow crafted
by a drunken leprechaun.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.637
I can say that 'cause
I'm three‐quarters Irish,

05:45.637 --> 05:47.681
and I have a teeny bit
of a drinking problem.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.766
‐ Wait. Tim was supposed
to meet Cutter here today.

05:54.396 --> 05:55.814
‐ I'm gonna guess you're not Cutter.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.649
‐ You come to Bayport,

05:57.649 --> 05:59.776
I have to hear it from
Miss Skullcap over here?

06:00.194 --> 06:01.945
You don't call me?

06:03.155 --> 06:04.781
‐ Hey, Mom.

07:02.256 --> 07:05.551
‐ And that sad and lonely boy

07:05.551 --> 07:08.679
raised by a psychologically abusive
mother was none other...

07:09.721 --> 07:13.225
than Stephen Joshua Sondheim.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.187
And let me tell you something about Steve.

07:17.187 --> 07:20.315
When he is on his game, it's a blessing.

07:20.315 --> 07:23.735
And when's he's not, I'm patient.
‐ Mm.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.487
‐ Hey.

07:25.487 --> 07:26.864
Tavo texted me that photo from Tim.

07:26.864 --> 07:28.407
Tim?

07:29.658 --> 07:31.159
From the Arconia, Tim?

07:32.786 --> 07:35.581
Why are you still in contact with
that boy after what he did to Oscar?

07:35.581 --> 07:38.584
‐ I'm not, Mommy. He died.

07:40.169 --> 07:42.087
‐ He was murdered.
‐ Murdered?

07:42.087 --> 07:44.339
‐ In the building.
‐ Catchy, right?

07:44.339 --> 07:45.549
‐ Ay, dios mio.

07:45.549 --> 07:47.426
That place is no good for you.

07:47.426 --> 07:49.303
I knew I shouldn't have
let you go back there.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.972
‐ Let me? I'm grown, Mommy.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.642
‐ We're investigating, and your daughter
has been a big help in this.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.728
‐ What do you mean investigating?
I mean, we,

07:57.728 --> 08:01.315
and your daughter, are producing a podcast
about Tim Kono's murder.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.777
‐ I only let you go back there
because you promised me

08:05.777 --> 08:07.654
you were focusing on your design career.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.656
‐ Stop saying that you let me.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.325
And a podcast is nothing.

08:11.325 --> 08:14.203
‐ Well, tell that to our 17 subscribers.

08:14.203 --> 08:15.662
‐ Wow. Seventeen, is that good?

08:15.662 --> 08:17.664
‐ No.
‐ My daughter can't help herself.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.375
She's trapped in the past.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.045
But, you...

08:23.879 --> 08:25.797
How old are you two? 80?

08:26.340 --> 08:28.091
‐ I'll have you know that I am in

08:28.091 --> 08:30.093
my very early mid‐60s.

08:30.093 --> 08:33.096
‐ Dragging my little girl back into
the worst thing that ever happened to her?

08:33.096 --> 08:34.556
‐ Look, I'm not a little girl!

08:36.683 --> 08:39.728
My friend, our friend, Zoe died

08:39.728 --> 08:42.564
at a New Year's Eve party
on the roof of the Arconia.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.776
And we think Tim saw what really happened.

08:45.776 --> 08:48.403
‐ But he never told anybody.
‐ Oscar got blamed and went away,

08:48.403 --> 08:50.697
but he's out now, and I'm fine.

08:52.533 --> 08:55.202
‐ Is fine not being able
to finish anything or focus

08:55.202 --> 08:57.079
because your mind is trapped in the past?

08:57.079 --> 08:58.956
‐ Please stop!
‐ Temores nocturnos fine?

09:03.418 --> 09:04.419
‐ Ahem.

09:16.348 --> 09:18.267
‐ Wait, what? "Not submitted"?

09:22.729 --> 09:24.815
Oh, I thought I sent you to IT.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.445
‐ How they hangin', Williams?

09:31.238 --> 09:33.490
‐ Lower by the day, Jerguson.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.826
‐ That's my guy.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.506
It's my fault.

09:52.217 --> 09:53.719
I was always working.

09:55.721 --> 09:58.098
So, when my rich sister
offered to take Mabel

09:58.098 --> 10:00.100
for the school breaks, I thought...

10:01.185 --> 10:02.686
qué maravilloso.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.647
She'd go to the city,

10:05.647 --> 10:08.150
see museums and plays...

10:09.776 --> 10:11.778
be inspired to dream big.

10:16.408 --> 10:19.494
You try watching your only child,

10:19.494 --> 10:22.497
so smart, so sure of herself...

10:23.540 --> 10:25.417
turn into a ghost from grief.

10:27.002 --> 10:29.505
Then see if you want to
make a podcast about it.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.966
‐ We didn't know about that.

10:33.717 --> 10:36.720
We didn't know about a lot... it seems.

10:38.055 --> 10:40.140
But, your daughter is extraordinary.

10:40.766 --> 10:42.142
She's funny,

10:42.142 --> 10:44.353
intuitive...
‐ Weird.

10:45.437 --> 10:48.857
But, in‐in‐in the best ways.

10:49.483 --> 10:52.152
The way all your favorite
people are weird.

10:52.152 --> 10:55.531
‐ Have you ever felt like
there was something you screwed up

10:55.531 --> 10:57.741
so bad,

10:57.741 --> 10:59.701
you'll never forgive yourself?

11:01.119 --> 11:02.162
‐ Well...

11:05.290 --> 11:07.334
‐ For me,

11:07.334 --> 11:10.337
it was letting her spend time
at that damn apartment.

11:12.381 --> 11:13.882
Please leave her be.

11:14.842 --> 11:17.719
Let her move forward, not back.

11:20.639 --> 11:21.932
‐ Mommy.

11:25.727 --> 11:29.022
‐ Thank you for dinner.
‐ Yeah, th‐thank you.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.988
You know, she's probably right.

11:37.072 --> 11:38.991
This whole thing was stupid anyways.

11:38.991 --> 11:40.909
‐ It was many things,

11:40.909 --> 11:42.494
but I'm not sure it was stupid.

11:42.494 --> 11:43.704
‐ Why?

11:43.704 --> 11:46.373
I'm a stranger that lied to you a bunch,

11:46.373 --> 11:49.543
and you're two randos that
dragged me into a podcast.

11:50.085 --> 11:53.714
‐ "Rando" is a slang for
a person of no significance.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.341
‐ I used context clues, but thank you.
‐ You're welcome.

11:56.341 --> 11:59.094
‐ You could still do the podcast though.

11:59.094 --> 12:01.847
Can learn how to use Twitter.
It's not that hard.

12:01.847 --> 12:03.432
Don't do TikTok.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.518
‐ Mabel, it's been, uh...

12:07.769 --> 12:11.273
it's been the most alive
I've felt in a decade.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.443
‐ Me, too.

12:23.035 --> 12:25.037
‐ So, uh...

12:25.037 --> 12:26.413
Goodbye.

12:42.221 --> 12:44.056
‐ We got yelled at.

12:44.056 --> 12:46.266
By a mom.
‐ I know.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.768
I'm shook.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.103
Mabel taught me that word.
‐ Mm.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.856
Same.
‐ You know, it's a law of nature.

12:52.856 --> 12:55.859
Nothing good ever happens on Long Island.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.907
Gut Milk is really good.

13:01.907 --> 13:04.701
‐ Right?! I think it's giving me abs.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.286
‐ 13% alcohol.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.330
‐ Mm.

13:08.330 --> 13:09.915
Cheers.
‐ Hey.

13:09.915 --> 13:12.000
We had a good run,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.919
but we can't possibly go on.

13:13.919 --> 13:15.796
‐ Fully agree.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.172
And why is that exactly?

13:17.172 --> 13:19.007
‐ This is Mabel's life.

13:19.007 --> 13:22.678
We can't exploit her pain,
playing detective.

13:22.678 --> 13:24.555
Every true crime story

13:24.555 --> 13:26.765
is actually true for someone.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.642
‐ And this is just occurring to you?

13:29.101 --> 13:31.228
‐ I guess it feels personal now.

13:31.228 --> 13:34.189
‐ It already felt personal
to me 'cause of Winnie.

13:36.191 --> 13:37.192
‐ Who's Winnie?

13:39.027 --> 13:41.822
‐ Who‐‐ Are you kidding me?!

13:41.822 --> 13:44.241
My dog! Winnie! Who's recovering

13:44.241 --> 13:45.826
from being poisoned‐‐ The fact that

13:45.826 --> 13:48.787
you forgot about her completely
is deeply concerning to me.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.289
‐ Why? We barely know each other.

13:50.289 --> 13:52.249
Mabel was right. We're all randos.

13:52.249 --> 13:53.667
‐ Of course we know each other!

13:53.667 --> 13:55.127
‐ Are my parents dead or alive?

13:55.127 --> 13:57.004
‐ Dead.
‐ Lucky guess.

13:58.630 --> 13:59.923
Is that Mabel?

13:59.923 --> 14:02.176
‐ No, it's Teddy. Our sponsor.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.721
"Come to me.

14:05.721 --> 14:07.723
We need to speak."

14:10.017 --> 14:11.977
‐ All caps. Ominous.

14:11.977 --> 14:14.313
‐ No, that's just the way he types.

14:14.313 --> 14:16.231
But it still seems bad.

14:18.066 --> 14:20.068
Would you mind coming with me?

14:20.068 --> 14:22.029
Or am I too rando?

14:34.124 --> 14:37.127
‐ You know I barely dated my entire 20s?

14:37.127 --> 14:38.170
Did you know that?

14:38.795 --> 14:40.047
I was alone.

14:41.256 --> 14:42.799
Then,

14:42.799 --> 14:44.510
on a random Tuesday night,

14:45.719 --> 14:48.347
I pull over this woman

14:48.347 --> 14:50.933
who I caught texting while driving.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.228
And then this broad had the audacity

14:54.228 --> 14:56.563
to lie to my face

14:56.563 --> 14:58.232
and say that she wasn't texting.

14:58.232 --> 14:59.733
‐ I wasn't lying!

14:59.733 --> 15:02.194
‐ You still lying to me in my face!

15:04.863 --> 15:06.907
But, I knew...

15:06.907 --> 15:08.408
then...

15:10.661 --> 15:12.788
I wasn't gonna be alone anymore.

15:15.207 --> 15:16.917
And now, we got this kid coming‐‐

15:16.917 --> 15:17.918
‐ Kareem.

15:17.918 --> 15:20.921
‐ No. Over my dead body.
We're not doing it.

15:23.674 --> 15:26.426
I just need to know that
I'm gonna be good at this.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.595
‐ You will be.
‐ No, you don't know that.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.847
‐ I do!

15:30.305 --> 15:32.808
Just like I knew those podcast guys
were onto something.

15:36.854 --> 15:38.021
You missed something, didn't you?

15:38.480 --> 15:40.482
‐ The tox reports...

15:41.525 --> 15:43.527
they weren't submitted.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.613
And the victim's phone...

15:47.239 --> 15:49.324
never made it to IT.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.743
‐ Oh my God, yes!

15:51.743 --> 15:53.537
So now, you swoop in there

15:53.537 --> 15:56.748
and reopen the case
like a goddamn hero boss,

15:56.748 --> 15:57.958
and just‐‐
‐ Baby, no.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.960
When they don't submit something,

15:59.960 --> 16:01.712
that means they want all hands off,

16:01.712 --> 16:05.048
and I can't get up to sergeant by opening
a case that I already closed.

16:05.048 --> 16:07.467
No. That's not how it works.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.553
That's what we're not gonna do.

16:11.597 --> 16:13.056
But what we will do...

16:14.266 --> 16:16.268
is that we gonna go in here

16:16.268 --> 16:17.895
and work on this nursery

16:17.895 --> 16:19.938
for my man Keith.
‐ Keith?

16:19.938 --> 16:23.483
‐ Oh yes. You know,
it's not quite... Kareem.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.403
‐ Yeah, it's not‐‐
‐ But it's also not lame as fuck.

16:26.403 --> 16:28.280
‐ I could dig it.
‐ Okay.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.657
‐ Keith...
‐ Thank you.

16:39.791 --> 16:42.628
‐ Wow, I think I would've remembered this.

16:42.628 --> 16:45.005
‐ Yeah. Well, during my depressing years,

16:45.005 --> 16:48.300
my mom told me to read
about the Tree of Life.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.802
Instead, I just made one.

16:51.220 --> 16:53.222
‐ It's amazing.

16:55.766 --> 16:57.351
Could never forget the SVU poster.

16:57.351 --> 16:59.353
Weird‐ass crush you had on Stabler.

16:59.353 --> 17:03.106
‐ The hottest criminal mind ever
is right here.

17:03.106 --> 17:04.775
‐ Oh.
‐ And he kept it pretty tight.

17:10.739 --> 17:13.742
I know it's nothing compared to
what you went through, but...

17:14.952 --> 17:17.913
I had it pretty hard after
everything happened.

17:18.372 --> 17:20.123
‐ Yeah.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.583
Seems like we all did.

17:25.796 --> 17:28.423
What's this? Huh?
‐ Oh. No, no.

17:28.423 --> 17:30.217
‐ Mabel Sixth Grade?
‐ So embarrassing.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.052
‐ Yes, please. Hold on.
‐ No! Don't want you to see it!

17:32.052 --> 17:34.304
‐ Have a seat! Come on!
‐ I don't wanna look at‐‐

17:34.304 --> 17:36.306
‐ We'll look at it together. Here.

17:38.392 --> 17:40.811
Whoa! Who is this cute little boy? Huh?

17:40.811 --> 17:43.021
Um, I was adorable.
I don't know what you're...

17:43.021 --> 17:45.691
‐ What did you do to Silvia
for her to give you a bowl cut?

17:45.691 --> 17:48.610
‐ And now, you've lost the right
to look at these. So, good job.

18:08.297 --> 18:10.549
Damn.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.471
Holy shit.

18:18.265 --> 18:19.516
Tavo's text.

18:24.813 --> 18:26.273
What the hell?

18:26.940 --> 18:30.360
‐ Why was Tim after the ring
that Zoe had on

18:30.360 --> 18:32.362
the night she died?
‐ No.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.490
She didn't have it on.

18:35.490 --> 18:36.950
Not when she died.

18:41.413 --> 18:44.583
You don't forget the image of your
girlfriend's body on the ground.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.378
‐ But it's right here.

18:49.796 --> 18:53.717
So, does this mean
she lost the ring before she went over?

18:53.717 --> 18:55.719
‐ Yo, can we stop now?

18:57.429 --> 18:59.765
‐ Are you okay?
‐ Can we please spend, like,

18:59.765 --> 19:02.267
two minutes talking about not death?

19:07.397 --> 19:10.108
All I wanted to do today
was just... be with you.

19:12.444 --> 19:14.446
I've thought about this moment a lot.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.783
I've thought about you a lot.

19:18.283 --> 19:19.785
‐ Me, too.

19:21.537 --> 19:23.830
I think...

19:23.830 --> 19:26.500
I've kind of been waiting for you.

19:28.126 --> 19:31.255
Uh, sorry.
I‐I don't mean waiting for you

19:31.255 --> 19:33.215
like I was waiting...

19:33.215 --> 19:35.467
waiting for you.
I didn't save myself for‐‐

19:35.467 --> 19:37.386
‐ No, no, yeah, yeah. Yeah. For sure.

19:37.386 --> 19:39.805
‐ I did other things. I...

19:39.805 --> 19:43.016
I worked. I went to parties.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.811
I got bangs that were awful,
and I had to hide for a month.

19:45.811 --> 19:47.354
‐ No, I‐I bet you looked hot.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.273
‐ You'd lose that bet.

19:49.940 --> 19:52.150
‐ Well, let's see for myself.
Were they like the lower‐‐

19:52.150 --> 19:54.152
‐ Little longer and then
they did, like, a curl...

19:54.152 --> 19:57.406
‐ Oh God. You're right.

19:57.406 --> 19:59.908
‐ They're‐‐ It's horrible.
I can't unsee that.

20:15.007 --> 20:17.050
‐ Do‐do you ever feel like you've been

20:17.050 --> 20:19.094
too inspirational, Cinda? You know,

20:19.094 --> 20:20.762
like everyone has a podcast now.

20:20.762 --> 20:23.807
‐ It has gotten a little out there.

20:23.807 --> 20:26.894
Like, I guess the actor who played Brazzos

20:26.894 --> 20:29.646
has his own podcast now?
What?

20:29.646 --> 20:31.690
Wait, Charles, uh...

20:31.690 --> 20:33.817
Haden Church?
No, I'm mixing him up.

20:33.817 --> 20:36.236
Uh... He's Brazzos, and he's

20:36.236 --> 20:39.740
investigating a real murder, uh,
in his Upper West Side building

20:39.740 --> 20:41.533
with a theater director

20:41.533 --> 20:43.452
and one of their granddaughters.
Wow.

20:43.452 --> 20:45.162
‐ And their prime suspect is Sting.

20:45.162 --> 20:46.413
‐ No!

20:46.413 --> 20:48.999
No!
Yes! The title of their podcast

20:48.999 --> 20:52.711
is Dimas Chicken Wraps Presents...

20:52.711 --> 20:55.339
Colon. Only Murders In The Building.

21:02.262 --> 21:03.931
‐ Well, I do‐‐ I do love
a Dimas Chicken Wrap.

21:03.931 --> 21:07.017
‐ Love 'em! Everybody loves
a Dimas Chicken Wrap.

21:07.017 --> 21:09.019
My goodness.

21:14.983 --> 21:16.360
Teddy...

21:17.653 --> 21:19.488
‐ Do you understand...

21:19.488 --> 21:21.698
how huge Fallon is in Greece?

21:23.200 --> 21:25.744
Do you know what
my cousins back on Nisyros

21:25.744 --> 21:27.371
are gonna do when they see this?

21:29.206 --> 21:31.834
They're gonna shit themselves, Ollie!

21:31.834 --> 21:34.878
They're gonna squat right down
in their goat fields

21:34.878 --> 21:37.923
and shit themselves in envy!

21:39.883 --> 21:42.511
‐ Ha. That's... Wow.

21:42.511 --> 21:44.012
‐ Yeah, that's... quite an image.

21:44.012 --> 21:47.015
‐ You did it! You fucking homered!

21:47.015 --> 21:49.685
Two episodes of your "podcast,"

21:49.685 --> 21:52.479
and my name is in Fallon's mouth! Wow!

21:53.480 --> 21:55.148
You've got more coming, right?
Please tell me

21:55.148 --> 21:56.733
you've got more coming soon!
Of course.

21:56.733 --> 21:59.194
Yes. Yes, of course.
‐ Actually, we've had a setback‐‐

21:59.194 --> 22:01.238
‐ With lots of juicy twists and turns

22:01.238 --> 22:04.283
and room for at least
four Dimas spots in every hour?

22:04.283 --> 22:06.243
‐ At least. Sure.
‐ Oh...

22:06.243 --> 22:09.705
I gotta tell you,
I feel like a proud papa.

22:09.705 --> 22:11.665
My boys.

22:11.665 --> 22:13.375
Now...

22:14.835 --> 22:16.837
I'm writing you a check...

22:18.547 --> 22:20.924
and it's gonna be large.

22:20.924 --> 22:23.635
But, I don't want a fight.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.973
50,000 for the next three episodes.
Oh...

22:28.765 --> 22:30.017
We can't accept that, Teddy.

22:31.143 --> 22:33.187
‐ Don't say that.
‐ Oh please, don't say that.

22:33.187 --> 22:35.814
‐ Well, uh, we lost one of our partners,
and it wouldn't be right.

22:39.735 --> 22:42.988
‐ Come here. Come here, right now.

22:50.078 --> 22:51.121
You see that?

22:51.830 --> 22:55.751
That coin is my entire family legacy.

22:56.793 --> 22:59.338
You know of the Greek
and Armenian Holocaust?

23:03.967 --> 23:05.469
My grandmother.

23:06.929 --> 23:09.306
My yiayia Evangelia

23:09.306 --> 23:11.850
was a young woman when the Turks

23:11.850 --> 23:14.394
started slaughtering all the Greeks,

23:14.394 --> 23:16.396
forcing them to flee their home.

23:18.857 --> 23:22.194
They didn't have banks back then,
so women would wear necklaces

23:22.194 --> 23:23.904
with their family's life savings

23:23.904 --> 23:26.198
in gold coins around their necks.

23:28.283 --> 23:31.036
Desperate to flee,
my yiayia made a trade

23:31.036 --> 23:32.704
with a Turkish soldier.

23:33.330 --> 23:36.708
Her necklace for a spot on a boat
to take her to America.

23:38.794 --> 23:41.296
The soldier let her keep two coins.

23:42.381 --> 23:44.883
One to invest in a new future,

23:46.009 --> 23:47.511
and one for luck.

23:49.930 --> 23:51.306
Yiayia...

23:51.849 --> 23:53.851
held tight to those coins...

23:55.060 --> 23:56.854
through a sea

23:56.854 --> 23:59.565
made red with blood
and the chopped‐off limbs

23:59.565 --> 24:01.567
of her whole family.

24:02.401 --> 24:05.404
Till she finally made it to Ellis Island.

24:07.865 --> 24:09.908
Still clutching those two coins.

24:11.285 --> 24:13.245
She used one

24:13.245 --> 24:15.205
to start a small sandwich shop,

24:15.205 --> 24:17.708
and the other she held onto...

24:18.959 --> 24:20.961
and passed it on to my father,

24:20.961 --> 24:23.463
so he'd never forget the sacrifices

24:23.463 --> 24:25.966
made to carry on

24:25.966 --> 24:28.051
our proud Dimas name.

24:28.969 --> 24:31.597
‐ And your father passed it to you.

24:31.597 --> 24:34.099
‐ We, uh, didn't see eye‐to‐eye.

24:36.602 --> 24:39.688
In fact, he vowed he'd take
the coin to his grave

24:39.688 --> 24:41.190
rather than give it to me.

24:42.274 --> 24:44.818
‐ Well, obviously he changed his mind.

24:46.153 --> 24:49.531
‐ Or I dug the fucker up and ripped
it out of his cold dead hands.

24:55.037 --> 24:57.247
‐ Oh... Oh...

24:58.415 --> 25:00.751
Oh, y‐‐ Oh...
‐ What... the fuck?

25:00.751 --> 25:02.377
‐ Th‐that's so good.

25:02.377 --> 25:03.962
Tha‐‐ You fooled me.

25:03.962 --> 25:06.006
‐ My yiayia Evangelia taught me

25:06.006 --> 25:08.926
to make investments in the people

25:08.926 --> 25:10.969
who've been loyal to you,

25:10.969 --> 25:12.679
even when there's risk.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.515
I have a whole separate business

25:14.515 --> 25:17.976
in her name where I do this work.

25:20.062 --> 25:21.563
So, please...

25:22.523 --> 25:24.024
do me this honor.

25:28.987 --> 25:31.281
So, is Oscar a good kisser?

25:31.281 --> 25:32.824
‐ Mommy!

25:32.824 --> 25:35.160
‐ I saw the way he was looking at you.

25:35.577 --> 25:37.829
The same way he looked at you
when you were teenagers.

25:39.831 --> 25:42.459
I wish I could go back
in time to those days.

25:43.043 --> 25:44.962
‐ And do what?

25:44.962 --> 25:46.463
‐ I don't know.

25:46.463 --> 25:48.799
Keep you there until...
‐ Till...

25:48.799 --> 25:50.300
‐ Until I'm dead.

25:50.884 --> 25:52.678
Then, you can go do whatever you wanted.

25:55.514 --> 25:57.599
The old men are sad characters.

25:58.809 --> 26:00.811
‐ I guess. Sort of.
‐ Mm.

26:02.855 --> 26:05.858
‐ They're also the first friends
I've had in a really long time.

26:07.442 --> 26:10.445
‐ But seriously, how old are they? Yeah.
‐ They're, like, really old.

26:14.283 --> 26:16.285
I have to see this through.

26:17.703 --> 26:19.872
I have to figure this out.

26:21.164 --> 26:23.375
‐ I could never read you stories
when you were little.

26:24.459 --> 26:26.253
I tried, but...

26:26.253 --> 26:29.631
you always wanted
to skip right to the end.

26:31.300 --> 26:34.303
You always needed to know what happened.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.144
Baby...

26:45.647 --> 26:49.067
CHARLES If only we
had a window into Tim Kono's mind.

26:49.067 --> 26:51.862
Some way to know more of
what he was doing in the days

26:51.862 --> 26:54.448
leading up to his death. A laptop,

26:54.448 --> 26:58.160
a calendar, any piece of physical
evidence that would bring us closer

26:58.160 --> 26:59.912
to the truth.

27:01.246 --> 27:04.333
I don't remember how Herman's Head ended,

27:04.333 --> 27:07.711
but I suspect it ended with
him finally finding the girl.

27:08.587 --> 27:10.589
Or the guy.
I could never tell with Herman.

27:13.383 --> 27:16.094
And not needing those advisors
in his head anymore.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.722
That's how I would've done it.

27:19.723 --> 27:22.726
Herman doesn't need them
'cause he's not alone anymore.

27:23.477 --> 27:25.354
But even if you're not alone,

27:25.354 --> 27:28.357
it doesn't mean you don't
need help sometimes.

27:28.982 --> 27:30.984
‐ We have 1,265 downlo‐‐

27:30.984 --> 27:32.653
1,267!

27:32.653 --> 27:34.238
Why do we have to get popular now?

27:34.238 --> 27:36.532
‐ Apparently, people still watch live TV.

27:36.532 --> 27:39.701
Where was this audience when
I directed Godspell Live on NBC?

27:39.701 --> 27:42.120
‐ That was you?
‐ No, but it should've been.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.956
See, I‐I'm not getting them.

27:43.956 --> 27:46.542
I'm hitting refresh,
and nothing is working.

27:46.542 --> 27:49.211
‐ You're in airplane mode. Again.

27:52.172 --> 27:54.925
What?
‐ You knew my phone settings.

27:54.925 --> 27:56.260
I'm not a rando.

27:57.052 --> 27:59.137
‐ Alright, we need to deal with this mess.

27:59.137 --> 28:02.850
Your dip man gave us $50,000.

28:02.850 --> 28:05.060
‐ Right, and‐and...

28:05.060 --> 28:07.563
we can't accept it because...

28:09.273 --> 28:11.483
we agreed not to profit off

28:11.483 --> 28:13.694
our young friend's tragedy.

28:13.694 --> 28:16.488
‐ That's right, so we have
to take that check,

28:16.488 --> 28:19.116
and we have to rip it up.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.417
Now?
‐ Yes.

28:28.417 --> 28:30.961
I think we have to rip it up, uh, now.

28:32.921 --> 28:34.756
Wait, wait, wait!
‐ Wha‐‐ Thank God. What?

28:35.424 --> 28:38.427
‐ What's this account?
It's not in Teddy's name.

28:38.427 --> 28:40.470
‐ Well, he said he had
a separate business account for‐‐

28:40.470 --> 28:41.597
‐ Look at the name.

28:43.932 --> 28:45.767
‐ "Angel, Inc."

28:48.520 --> 28:51.940
Oh no, no, no. Teddy is not the Angel
that Tim Kono was trying to bring down.

28:51.940 --> 28:53.567
‐ I was wondering

28:53.567 --> 28:55.694
when he said his yiayia's name.

28:55.694 --> 28:57.529
Evangelia.

28:57.529 --> 28:58.655
Angel.

29:02.409 --> 29:03.827
You don't knock?
‐ Hey.

29:03.827 --> 29:06.830
‐ Women who knock rarely make history.

29:08.540 --> 29:11.084
A peace offering. Silvia's tamales,

29:11.084 --> 29:13.086
and I picked up some hummus.

29:15.297 --> 29:16.840
‐ This hummus expired yesterday.

29:18.091 --> 29:19.468
‐ But we both know you're gonna eat it.

29:20.260 --> 29:21.470
‐ I know. It's true.

29:22.429 --> 29:23.680
‐ Look...

29:26.642 --> 29:29.645
I'm really sorry about lying to you guys.

29:29.645 --> 29:32.147
‐ On multiple fronts. For weeks.

29:32.147 --> 29:34.358
‐ An inordinate amount of lying.

29:34.358 --> 29:36.735
It was borderline sociopathic.

29:36.735 --> 29:38.237
‐ It's just...

29:38.237 --> 29:40.531
very hard for me to trust people.

29:42.032 --> 29:45.577
Honestly, it's pretty hard
for me to even like people.

29:47.746 --> 29:48.997
But you guys...

29:52.918 --> 29:54.837
Are you really gonna make me say it?

29:54.837 --> 29:57.089
‐ I'd kinda like to hear the words, yes.

29:57.089 --> 30:00.759
‐ Also rank us. I'm dying to
know who your favorite is.

30:01.218 --> 30:03.303
‐ I want to do this podcast.

30:03.303 --> 30:05.430
I have to finish this with you guys.

30:08.809 --> 30:10.227
‐ That...

30:10.227 --> 30:12.312
is so rando.

30:12.771 --> 30:14.106
‐ That...

30:14.106 --> 30:15.524
is not the right gesture.

30:16.441 --> 30:19.111
‐ Give me those tamales.
‐ Wait.

30:19.903 --> 30:21.905
My final peace offering.

30:25.409 --> 30:27.828
Someone left this for
me at the front desk.

30:29.079 --> 30:30.789
It's Tim Kono's phone.

30:30.789 --> 30:31.915
- What?
- Whoa!

30:31.915 --> 30:33.333
‐ But we need to find the password.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.252
‐ Oy...
‐ Oh...

30:35.252 --> 30:37.254
‐ Well, we got one for you.

30:39.798 --> 30:41.466
Here.

30:41.466 --> 30:43.468
Say hello...

30:44.178 --> 30:45.220
to Angel.

30:45.804 --> 30:47.514
‐ Teddy Dimas?

30:47.514 --> 30:48.724
Wait, so you're saying‐‐

30:48.724 --> 30:50.601
‐ That's right. Our prime sponsor

30:50.601 --> 30:52.853
is now our prime suspect.

30:52.853 --> 30:54.855
‐ Ooh, that's good.

30:55.439 --> 30:57.941
That'll make a great
last line for an episode.
