WEBVTT

00:10.327 --> 00:11.468
(sighs)

00:16.183 --> 00:20.335
You know, Strand, you might be
a hell of a fire captain,

00:20.354 --> 00:22.412
but you're not
much of a spy.

00:22.431 --> 00:25.190
Do you know how easy it was
for me to find that thing?

00:25.342 --> 00:26.984
Who do you work for, Owen?

00:27.677 --> 00:28.694
ATF?

00:29.271 --> 00:30.254
FBI?

00:30.256 --> 00:31.271
Get out of my house.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.158
Grab a helmet.
We're going for a ride.

00:35.928 --> 00:39.038
(theme music plays)

00:52.035 --> 00:53.777
And what are we doing here?

00:53.796 --> 00:55.203
Well...

00:55.281 --> 00:56.764
there's someone
I want you to meet.

00:57.541 --> 00:58.724
(knock on door)

01:01.062 --> 01:02.210
Hey, buddy boy.

01:02.288 --> 01:03.470
What are you still doing up?

01:03.547 --> 01:05.455
JOANNE:
Jacob, only Mommy
opens the door.

01:05.549 --> 01:07.382
SGT. TY O'BRIEN:
Hey, Jo.
Mind if we come in?

01:07.401 --> 01:08.984
Who's this?

01:10.738 --> 01:11.695
A friend.

01:12.464 --> 01:13.647
This is my nephew, Andy.

01:13.741 --> 01:17.392
His mom, my sister Melinda,
died when he was 16.

01:17.469 --> 01:19.136
Breast cancer.

01:19.154 --> 01:20.470
The father was
never really in the picture

01:20.564 --> 01:22.989
so I tried to do everything
that I could for him.

01:23.066 --> 01:25.976
Uncle Ty has been great
to us, real great.

01:25.994 --> 01:27.327
Andy's got a big heart.

01:27.479 --> 01:29.980
He's been in a little trouble.
Nothing serious.

01:29.982 --> 01:31.148
But ever since
Jake came along,

01:31.166 --> 01:32.816
he's really
straightened his act up.

01:32.818 --> 01:35.410
Hasn't he, big boy?
Up here.

01:35.487 --> 01:37.429
This was him when, uh,
Jacob was first born.

01:37.581 --> 01:39.840
<i> -He's so big.</i>
-JOANNE:
<i> You don't gotta me that.</i>

01:39.992 --> 01:40.748
<i> There's your mama.</i>

01:40.768 --> 01:42.101
<i> Huh? See your mama?</i>

01:42.328 --> 01:46.087
About a month ago,
Jo got a call from Andy
late at night.

01:46.165 --> 01:47.331
He said he was scared, right?

01:47.333 --> 01:49.182
Yeah, yeah. And Andy, he...

01:49.335 --> 01:51.335
he don't scare easy.

01:51.337 --> 01:54.020
He said he was sorry,
that he was in trouble.

01:54.097 --> 01:55.656
Wouldn't say for what.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.450
And not to look for him.

01:59.769 --> 02:01.695
O'BRIEN:
That's the last
anyone's heard from him.

02:01.847 --> 02:04.272
Why do I feel like I know
where this is headed?

02:04.291 --> 02:06.125
Because you absolutely do.

02:06.201 --> 02:07.942
He joined the Honor Dogs
about a year ago.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.370
Didn't tell me 'cause
he knew I wouldn't approve.

02:10.447 --> 02:12.522
I thought they were
real nice at first.

02:12.524 --> 02:17.210
Was even invited to barbecues
with the wives and kids.

02:17.363 --> 02:19.621
Then Andy stopped
spending time with us

02:19.698 --> 02:22.457
and started spending
a whole lot more time with them.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.719
He'd come home
worked up, angry. I--

02:25.795 --> 02:29.373
I told him to stop going
if it wasn't fun no more.

02:29.391 --> 02:32.042
Said he couldn't quit
even if he wanted to.

02:32.044 --> 02:33.059
And what did the police say?

02:33.212 --> 02:35.487
They say that he's not
really missing

02:35.639 --> 02:38.715
because he called me to say
that he wasn't coming home.

02:38.734 --> 02:42.736
That he's an adult
and he can leave if he wants to.

02:42.812 --> 02:45.389
They're not even
looking for him.

02:45.407 --> 02:49.242
So you're in there looking
for evidence of a crime.

02:49.395 --> 02:51.503
No, I'm in there
lookin' for my nephew.

02:53.582 --> 02:54.339
-Ow!
-Oh.

02:54.491 --> 02:56.416
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

02:56.493 --> 02:57.751
Jacob! Not nice.

02:57.845 --> 02:58.919
-O'BRIEN: Grab some ice.
-JOANNE: Yeah, I got-- Let me--

02:59.071 --> 03:00.495
OWEN STRAND:
No, it's fine. (chuckles)

03:00.514 --> 03:01.496
O'BRIEN: You okay?

03:01.515 --> 03:02.497
Feel like
I was hit by a truck.

03:02.574 --> 03:03.407
JOANNE:
He's been acting out.

03:03.425 --> 03:04.591
-I'm gonna be fine.
-You okay?

03:04.743 --> 03:06.351
I am so sorry. Jacob!

03:06.428 --> 03:08.745
Time for bed,
you little monster.

03:08.764 --> 03:10.764
-OWEN: Oof.
That kid's got an arm.
-Yeah.

03:10.840 --> 03:12.766
OWEN:
You should sign him up
for the softball team.

03:12.918 --> 03:14.509
-O'BRIEN: Sorry, Owen.
-Yeah.

03:14.586 --> 03:16.086
Ty, I-I'm sorry
you're going through

03:16.088 --> 03:18.088
what you're going through.

03:18.106 --> 03:19.756
Thank you.

03:19.758 --> 03:23.368
Look, the, uh, the people
that sent you in there,

03:23.520 --> 03:25.687
they've been watching these guys
a lot longer than I have.

03:25.764 --> 03:28.356
Maybe they've seen
something that I haven't.

03:28.434 --> 03:29.691
I could bring you in,
you can talk to them

03:29.710 --> 03:30.934
and see if they could help you.

03:30.936 --> 03:32.527
No, I don't trust
the federal government,

03:32.604 --> 03:33.937
not at this moment.

03:34.030 --> 03:35.121
You sound like them.

03:35.274 --> 03:36.215
Look, if Andy's still alive,

03:36.366 --> 03:38.533
I just wanna
bring him home safe.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.386
Him going to a federal prison
doesn't do this family any good.

03:41.538 --> 03:44.281
So, I don't suppose
you wanna tell me

03:44.299 --> 03:46.433
what the government thinks
they're planning?

03:48.545 --> 03:50.437
You know I can't talk
to you about that.

03:51.381 --> 03:52.481
Yeah.

03:53.517 --> 03:54.691
I understand.

03:56.962 --> 03:58.795
Maybe...

03:58.814 --> 04:01.698
you don't need to tell them
about me and my nephew either.

04:05.562 --> 04:07.487
DETECTIVE GRIER:
So when Iris left here
the other night,

04:07.489 --> 04:09.973
you had just served her
with divorce papers?

04:09.975 --> 04:11.975
I don't think "served"
is the right word.

04:11.977 --> 04:13.460
She took them with her.

04:15.814 --> 04:17.589
Did she seem
upset or agitated?

04:17.741 --> 04:19.483
No.

04:19.501 --> 04:22.076
So you wouldn't characterize
this divorce as contentious?

04:22.154 --> 04:23.428
Not at all.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.266
And how long has Iris

04:27.417 --> 04:29.268
been diagnosed
as paranoid schizophrenic?

04:30.271 --> 04:32.771
Uh, she wasn't
officially diagnosed

04:32.922 --> 04:34.331
until after her sister

04:34.424 --> 04:36.650
found her living on the streets
a few years ago.

04:37.927 --> 04:39.695
She had been struggling
for a while.

04:42.283 --> 04:44.357
She's-- she's in
a good place now.

04:44.510 --> 04:47.619
She's seeing a psychiatrist.
She's taking her meds.

04:47.696 --> 04:49.413
She's holding down a job.

04:50.532 --> 04:51.665
She's better.

04:53.535 --> 04:56.202
And yet she left her meds
behind in her car

04:56.355 --> 04:57.779
when she walked away.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.507
I don't think she walked away.
I think she was working.

05:01.376 --> 05:02.617
Officer Reyes,

05:02.694 --> 05:04.619
I know you're worried
about your friend,

05:04.696 --> 05:07.531
but I have nothing at that car
to suggest foul play.

05:07.533 --> 05:09.457
What I do have
are a set of divorce papers

05:09.535 --> 05:10.717
handed to her three days ago

05:10.869 --> 05:13.795
by a husband she hasn't seen
in over five years.

05:13.872 --> 05:15.372
Divorce papers
she had not signed.

05:15.374 --> 05:17.482
She wasn't upset
about the divorce.

05:19.378 --> 05:22.062
The reason she didn't
sign the papers...

05:22.156 --> 05:23.563
is because she thought
it would be better

05:23.715 --> 05:24.990
if they got an annulment.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.310
I went to see her.

05:29.388 --> 05:32.331
-What? When?
-Yesterday.

05:32.407 --> 05:34.224
Why?

05:34.226 --> 05:36.501
So-- so she could
sign the papers.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.396
-TK.
-So you confronted her?

05:39.414 --> 05:42.090
No. No, no.
It-it wasn't like that at all.

05:42.901 --> 05:44.384
We even hugged.

05:48.832 --> 05:51.925
Alright. I'll be in touch.

05:52.077 --> 05:53.743
If either one of you thinks
of anything else,

05:53.762 --> 05:55.095
here's my card.

05:55.171 --> 05:56.613
-Thank you, detective.
-GRIER: Mm-hmm.

05:56.615 --> 05:57.731
I'll walk you out.

06:09.611 --> 06:10.927
Carlos.

06:10.946 --> 06:12.662
She was fine when I saw her.

06:13.523 --> 06:14.664
I swear to God.

06:16.693 --> 06:17.667
Okay.

06:21.607 --> 06:23.440
-Where are you going?
-I have a shift.

06:23.442 --> 06:25.942
TK STRAND:
Yeah. Tomorrow morning.

06:25.961 --> 06:27.177
I'm starting early.

06:29.281 --> 06:31.223
I can't just sit here

06:31.299 --> 06:32.891
while she's out there.

06:33.042 --> 06:35.301
-You think it's my fault.
-CARLOS REYES:
I didn't say that.

06:35.378 --> 06:36.978
Yeah, but you're thinking it.

06:38.306 --> 06:40.715
You should have
given her time, TK.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.143
-We weren't supposed
to push, remember?
-Uh, I-I know.

06:43.295 --> 06:44.403
Yeah, she would have
come around on her own.

06:44.479 --> 06:46.571
You didn't have to
go there and badger her.

06:47.983 --> 06:49.649
I know.

06:49.801 --> 06:50.742
Look, I'm sorry.

06:51.561 --> 06:53.161
But she was fine.

06:54.156 --> 06:55.497
She's not fine.

06:59.327 --> 07:00.460
I gotta go.

07:03.832 --> 07:05.048
(sighs)

07:05.817 --> 07:07.426
(engine revving)

07:10.431 --> 07:11.596
(engine stops)

07:15.084 --> 07:17.327
-JUDD RYDER: Whoa!
-Hey, Judd.

07:17.329 --> 07:19.187
What, you forget to duck?

07:20.165 --> 07:21.848
Oh, this?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.516
Eh. It's nothing.

07:23.593 --> 07:25.426
It don't look like nothin'.
Looks like a story.

07:25.504 --> 07:27.779
Yeah, it's just not a story
that's worth telling.

07:27.931 --> 07:30.356
But I will tell you this,
this time I didn't swing first.

07:30.433 --> 07:32.842
In fact,
I didn't even swing at all.

07:32.861 --> 07:34.035
(cell phone ringing)

07:35.013 --> 07:37.013
(sighs) I gotta take this.

07:37.032 --> 07:38.014
Sure.

07:38.033 --> 07:39.458
(ringing continues)

07:40.109 --> 07:41.776
This is Strand.

07:41.945 --> 07:44.187
AGENT ROSE KACEY: (on phone)
<i> Captain Strand,</i>
<i> Special Agent Kacey.</i>

07:44.206 --> 07:45.522
<i> We'd like you to come in.</i>

07:45.524 --> 07:47.073
Right now?
My shift just started.

07:47.283 --> 07:49.876
KACEY:
<i> We need to coordinate you</i>
<i> going back to the roadhouse</i>

07:49.953 --> 07:51.861
<i> and activating</i>
<i> the listening device.</i>

07:51.863 --> 07:53.805
<i> Do you have a free spot</i>
<i> in your schedule today?</i>

07:53.957 --> 07:57.959
Yeah, I don't really schedule
my days like that. Chaos does.

07:58.036 --> 08:01.313
KACEY:
<i>I know you appreciate the level</i>
<i>of chaos we could be facing</i>

08:01.464 --> 08:03.373
<i> if we don't</i>
<i> get ahead of this, Captain.</i>

08:03.375 --> 08:04.983
Alright,
I'll see what I can do.

08:05.060 --> 08:06.376
(line disconnects)

08:06.394 --> 08:08.394
What do you think
he's playing at?

08:08.547 --> 08:10.030
I have no idea.

08:16.404 --> 08:17.979
Can you tell me
your location?

08:18.165 --> 08:19.389
CALLER: (on phone)

08:21.168 --> 08:22.225

08:32.513 --> 08:35.329
Please, okay, she's over here.
She's not answering me.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.599
Okay, I need to step back, sir.
Thank you.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.413
Ma'am, can you hear me?

08:43.415 --> 08:44.839
No movement.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.174
Alright, Strickland, Marwani,
you're riding the ropes.

08:47.252 --> 08:49.343
Judd and Mateo,
you're on the winch.

08:49.421 --> 08:51.345
Prep fluids. Be prepared
for internal injuries,

08:51.365 --> 08:53.089
broken bones,
and a possible TBI.

08:53.108 --> 08:54.491
-Copy.
-Copy.

08:55.093 --> 08:58.161
♪ ♪

09:08.273 --> 09:09.956
-The victim, is she okay?
-Uh, we just got here.

09:10.033 --> 09:11.198
We're just suiting up.
What do you mean, "victim"?

09:11.276 --> 09:12.717
A witness on the service road
called in to say

09:12.886 --> 09:15.703
that she saw a man throw
what had looked like a body
over the cliff.

09:15.781 --> 09:19.391
The body matches the description
of a recent CLEAR Alert.

09:19.467 --> 09:22.043
-Iris?

Yes. Is she okay?

09:47.403 --> 09:49.662
You told the operator
your girlfriend slipped?

09:49.815 --> 09:51.147
Oh, it's all my fault.

You know, I was gonna

she sensed it and--

feel comfortable

10:01.084 --> 10:02.249
talking about that
with a stranger.

10:02.344 --> 10:03.435
You're gonna have
to answer the question, sir.

10:03.511 --> 10:06.346
The woman you say fell,
is her name Iris?

10:06.498 --> 10:09.691
Oh, I don't like that name.
I call her Chrissy.

10:11.353 --> 10:13.945
Marwani, Strickland,
status report, please.

10:14.022 --> 10:16.189
Gettin' there, Cap.
Still not seeing any movement.

10:16.265 --> 10:17.932
MARJAN MARWANI:
Or any blood, for that matter.

10:18.009 --> 10:19.117
CARLOS:
If that's your girlfriend
down there,

10:19.268 --> 10:20.860
then you must have
a picture of her on your phone.

10:20.937 --> 10:23.196
-Show it to me.
-She doesn't like
to have her picture taken.

10:23.348 --> 10:24.289
She's not really
your girlfriend, is she?

10:24.440 --> 10:26.032
Why does everyone say that?

10:26.109 --> 10:27.942
Did you take her
off the street?

10:27.961 --> 10:31.129
I didn't t-take her!
I found her.

10:31.206 --> 10:33.189
Where did you find her?

10:33.191 --> 10:34.758
Officer! A word.

10:37.787 --> 10:40.287
Detective, we have a witness
responding to the CLEAR Alert.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.048
Yeah. Do we have
a positive ID?

10:42.200 --> 10:43.391
CARLOS:
Not yet. They're...

10:44.202 --> 10:46.035
retrieving her.

10:46.054 --> 10:48.396
Mm-hmm.
You let me handle this.

10:50.208 --> 10:52.299
Mr. Granger, hi.
I'm Detective Grier.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.444
I have just a couple
of questions for you.

10:58.566 --> 11:00.307
Ma'am?

11:00.385 --> 11:02.735
-Ma'am?
-PAUL STRICKLAND:
Still no movement.

11:02.888 --> 11:05.071
MARJAN:
Ma'am, we need
to turn you over.

11:05.073 --> 11:06.906
-Oh!
-Oh.

11:07.058 --> 11:08.574
-No way.
-OWEN: (over radio)
<i> Alright, talk to me.</i>

11:08.651 --> 11:10.284
PAUL: (over radio)
<i> It's not Iris Blake, Cap.</i>

11:10.361 --> 11:12.078
-You sure?
-PAUL:<i> Yeah, I'm pretty sure.</i>

11:12.230 --> 11:13.730
It's not Iris.

11:13.748 --> 11:15.064
It's not Iris.

11:15.066 --> 11:15.899
Is she alive?

11:15.917 --> 11:17.083
MARJAN:<i> Uh, nope.</i>

11:17.235 --> 11:19.844
Was she alive
when she went over, you think?

11:19.996 --> 11:22.097
She-- she was never alive.

11:25.334 --> 11:27.060
She's a sex doll, Cap.

11:29.931 --> 11:32.357
Uh, what do you want us to do?

11:37.013 --> 11:39.364
-OWEN:<i> Sit tight.</i>
-Sit tight?

11:40.442 --> 11:42.275
Do you wanna try
mouth-to-mouth?

11:42.351 --> 11:43.684
I don't know where she's been.

11:43.778 --> 11:45.662
(both laughing)

11:50.785 --> 11:54.028
Okay, so the detective
has just gotten off the phone

11:54.105 --> 11:55.772
with, uh,
Mr. Granger's psychiatrist,

11:55.790 --> 11:57.123
and apparently he suffers from

11:57.200 --> 11:59.718
some sort of
attachment disorder.

11:59.794 --> 12:04.781
And he and Chrissy have been
together for over two years.

12:04.783 --> 12:06.466
-So it's serious then?
-No, obviously the therapy

12:06.618 --> 12:08.709
has progressed to the point
that he's ready to move on.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.377
I think it's time.

12:10.455 --> 12:14.123
Okay, so if he brought her
up here to murder her,

12:14.142 --> 12:15.458
why did he call 9-1-1?

12:15.460 --> 12:17.402
He can't let go
of a bad relationship.

12:17.553 --> 12:19.220
So maybe we can
give him a hand with that.

12:19.297 --> 12:21.055
Help end his suffering.

12:21.132 --> 12:22.490
And Chrissy's.

12:23.059 --> 12:24.909
(beeping)

12:25.061 --> 12:26.819
NANCY GILLIAN:
Come on, Chrissy!

12:26.896 --> 12:28.079
Stay with us.

12:28.231 --> 12:30.490
Oh, God,
please let her be okay.

12:30.566 --> 12:32.900
Her pulse is dropping, Cap.
We're losing her.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.294
No, damn it!

12:34.996 --> 12:35.920
Live!

12:36.072 --> 12:37.663
-Live!
-(flatline)

12:37.816 --> 12:38.757
TOMMY VEGA: Flatline.

12:38.833 --> 12:40.258
Nancy, it's over.

12:40.376 --> 12:42.969
-You did everything you could.
-(sighs)

12:45.766 --> 12:47.156
I'm sorry.

12:47.158 --> 12:49.267
Her injuries
were extremely grave.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.603
Would you like to say goodbye?

12:51.679 --> 12:52.687
Yeah.

12:54.590 --> 12:55.565
(sniffles)

12:57.927 --> 12:59.002
Goodbye, Chrissy.

12:59.020 --> 13:00.487
(sniffles)

13:02.007 --> 13:03.172
I'll love you forever.

13:03.174 --> 13:05.033
Or your money back.

13:08.179 --> 13:11.030
Ohh, I can't believe she's gone.

13:11.107 --> 13:12.499
I'm sorry for your loss.

13:13.868 --> 13:15.043
What do I do now?

13:16.538 --> 13:17.370
Keep going.

13:17.613 --> 13:19.631
It's what Chrissy
would have wanted.

13:20.859 --> 13:22.634
Thank you.

13:22.710 --> 13:25.595
You may not have saved her,
but I think you saved me.

13:26.698 --> 13:27.764
That's what we're here for.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.564
Captain Strand, thanks for--

13:39.894 --> 13:42.136
What happened to you?

13:42.213 --> 13:43.713
Nothing,
I walked into a door.

13:43.806 --> 13:45.214
Eye first?

13:45.216 --> 13:46.574
It was the doorknob.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.902
(groans) Alright.

13:50.021 --> 13:51.645
So, about the listening device

13:51.723 --> 13:54.057
-we asked you to plant--
-Oh, the listening device

13:54.059 --> 13:55.667
you neglected to show me
how to turn on.

13:55.818 --> 13:56.960
It's on.

13:57.896 --> 13:59.745
-It's on? How?
-Yes.

13:59.898 --> 14:00.839
I assume you turned it on

14:00.915 --> 14:02.423
when you put it in your pocket.

14:03.826 --> 14:04.901
In my pocket?

14:04.919 --> 14:06.594
Yes. In your pocket.

14:08.406 --> 14:11.908
Yes, it's in my pocket.
Because I put it there.

14:11.926 --> 14:14.018
-See? There.
-Why?

14:14.170 --> 14:15.336
-Why?
-Yes.

14:15.413 --> 14:18.005
Because I couldn't sleep.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.357
I was worried that
somebody would find it,

14:19.508 --> 14:20.525
and then they would
blame the new guy,

14:20.602 --> 14:22.268
and then they would
kill the new guy.

14:22.345 --> 14:23.844
So I went back and I got it.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.346
And walked into a doorknob?

14:25.423 --> 14:27.681
I had to get on my knees.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.516
Just out of curiosity,
how long has this
been transmitting?

14:29.536 --> 14:31.703
Well, at least before
your drive over here,

14:31.854 --> 14:34.947
when we were treated to
an alarmingly off-key rendition

14:35.041 --> 14:36.190
of "Bridge over Troubled Water."

14:36.267 --> 14:38.101
That is a very difficult
song to sing.

14:38.119 --> 14:40.436
Look, just tell me
how to turn this thing on.

14:40.455 --> 14:42.213
Oh, better yet,
tell me how to turn it off,

14:42.365 --> 14:45.199
and then I will go back
and I will replant it.

14:45.276 --> 14:46.533
I'm just gonna
get another one.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.444
Well, this one works
pretty well obviously.

14:48.446 --> 14:49.220
It's protocol.

14:49.372 --> 14:51.114
Maybe grab a bunch of 'em.

14:51.116 --> 14:53.725
(door opens, closes)

15:00.458 --> 15:03.318
♪ ♪

15:30.931 --> 15:32.388
(door opens)

15:35.251 --> 15:36.417
Let me show you
how to turn this on.

15:36.494 --> 15:38.177
-Uh, I think I got it.
-You sure?

15:38.329 --> 15:41.255
It involves moving
the switch into the on position.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.682
Well, you could have
told me that a lot earlier.

15:42.834 --> 15:44.000
There's no need
to cop an attitude.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.444
Well, I can have them
draw up a diagram if you'd like.

15:46.595 --> 15:47.503
I think I can handle it.

15:47.614 --> 15:51.023
Just plant it,
turn it on, and leave.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.025
And you'll be
done with all this.

15:53.178 --> 15:55.244
Okay, I'll do it.

15:56.531 --> 15:59.040
And watch the doorknob
on your way out.

16:09.861 --> 16:11.427
(woman whispering)

16:13.289 --> 16:14.864
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Can you speak up?

16:14.866 --> 16:16.048
I can't really hear you.

16:16.201 --> 16:19.385
WOMAN: (on phone)
<i> He's in the room. Asleep.</i>

16:19.462 --> 16:20.627
Okay. Well, then,

16:20.796 --> 16:23.130
you keep your voice
nice and low then, that's fine.

16:23.208 --> 16:24.874
Use as few words as you can.

16:24.876 --> 16:26.150
Can you tell me where you are?

16:26.227 --> 16:27.151
-WOMAN:<i> No.</i>
-Okay.

16:27.228 --> 16:28.987
Is it an apartment or a house?

16:29.138 --> 16:30.213
WOMAN:<i> A house.</i>

16:30.231 --> 16:32.473
<i> He drove me here. I...</i>

16:32.550 --> 16:33.382
<i> I don't know.</i>

16:33.568 --> 16:34.975
It's okay, love.
I'm gonna find you.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.995
My name is Grace.
What's your name?

16:37.146 --> 16:40.540
WOMAN:
<i> Iris. Iris Blake.</i>

16:45.897 --> 16:48.080
Iris, I'm with you, okay?

16:48.233 --> 16:50.233
Listen, I'm trying
to locate your phone.

16:50.251 --> 16:51.509
It's not coming up.

16:51.586 --> 16:53.069
IRIS BLAKE:<i> His.</i>

16:53.071 --> 16:54.345
Oh, his--
Okay, It's his phone.

16:54.422 --> 16:55.905
-IRIS:<i> Yes.</i>
-GRACE RYDER: Okay.

16:55.923 --> 16:58.758
Maybe it's a burner or something
because I can't track it.

16:58.834 --> 17:02.937
Iris, is there any way you can
safely get past him to run?

17:03.431 --> 17:04.747
IRIS:<i> No.</i>

17:04.766 --> 17:06.357
<i> Mattress...</i>

17:06.434 --> 17:07.859
Uh-huh.

17:07.935 --> 17:09.694
Iris, you with me still?

17:09.845 --> 17:11.678
IRIS: ...<i> against door.</i>

17:11.731 --> 17:14.014
Okay, so he's asleep on
a mattress in front of the door

17:14.034 --> 17:16.034
-so you can't get out.
-IRIS:<i> Yes.</i>

17:16.185 --> 17:17.535
(keys clacking)

17:17.612 --> 17:18.778
GRACE:
Are you hurt?

17:18.854 --> 17:20.687
IRIS:
<i> He's going to kill me.</i>

17:20.707 --> 17:22.114
I can't pull a location either.

17:22.267 --> 17:23.541
Could she
give us any details?

17:23.692 --> 17:25.001
Uh-uh.

17:26.771 --> 17:28.437
You know what?

17:28.456 --> 17:29.714
Iris, I'm not leaving you, okay?

17:29.865 --> 17:32.050
Give me one second.

17:32.126 --> 17:35.702
APD Unit
three-six-three-H-twenty,
do you copy?

17:35.780 --> 17:37.055
Copy, dispatch. What's up?

17:37.131 --> 17:38.205
GRACE:
<i> Carlos, it's Grace.</i>

17:38.283 --> 17:40.183
I have Iris on the line.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.636
Dispatch, how is she?

17:43.730 --> 17:44.970
She's being held hostage.

17:45.123 --> 17:46.789
<i> She took his phone</i>
<i> while he was sleeping,</i>

17:46.791 --> 17:47.899
<i> but I can't locate the signal.</i>

17:47.975 --> 17:48.958
I need to know

17:49.218 --> 17:50.810
where you guys found
Iris' car last night.

17:50.962 --> 17:53.905
Rusk Heights.
Near the homeless encampment
under 183.

17:53.981 --> 17:55.481
-(keys clacking)
-(beeps)

17:55.633 --> 17:57.891
Iris, do you remember
anything about being

17:57.893 --> 17:58.984
in his vehicle last night?

17:59.137 --> 18:02.121
Maybe what direction
you guys were going in?

18:02.731 --> 18:04.640
IRIS:<i> No. Knife.</i>

18:04.659 --> 18:06.992
Oh, he had a knife?
That's how he took you?

18:07.087 --> 18:08.494
IRIS:<i> Yes.</i>

18:08.571 --> 18:09.587
<i> His trunk.</i>

18:09.738 --> 18:11.330
Okay, Iris, I really
want you to think back.

18:11.407 --> 18:14.609
How long did it feel like
you were in the trunk moving?

18:14.611 --> 18:17.578
Maybe five minutes
or closer to an hour?

18:17.597 --> 18:20.264
IRIS:
<i> Eleven minutes,</i>
<i> twenty seconds.</i>

18:20.916 --> 18:21.915
You counted.

18:21.917 --> 18:22.825
IRIS:<i> Yes.</i>

18:22.918 --> 18:24.084
GRACE:
That's really good, Iris.

18:24.329 --> 18:26.771
And was he going fast or normal,
like the speed limit?

18:26.922 --> 18:28.255
IRIS:<i> Normal.</i>

18:28.333 --> 18:31.851
That's 11 and a half minutes
at 30 miles per hour.

18:32.003 --> 18:33.644
SARA ORTIZ:
A five-to-eight-mile radius.

18:33.796 --> 18:34.854
Iris, can you tell me anything

18:34.930 --> 18:36.505
about the house
you're in right now?

18:36.599 --> 18:37.448
Is it big?

18:37.600 --> 18:39.617
(Iris breathing shakily)

18:39.768 --> 18:41.694
Okay, is it new?

18:41.770 --> 18:43.329
-IRIS:<i> Abandoned.</i>
-Okay.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.368
Okay. That's Laurel Commons
in Rusk Heights.

18:49.445 --> 18:51.295
Isn't that where
all the loitering calls
were coming from?

18:51.372 --> 18:53.798
Uh-huh.
Lots of foreclosures
that are sitting empty.

18:54.025 --> 18:55.708
Full of squatters
and drug users.

18:55.860 --> 18:56.968
Flophouses.

18:57.044 --> 18:58.377
IRIS:
<i> He's going to wake up.</i>

18:58.529 --> 18:59.712
Okay, Iris,
you hang in there, okay?

18:59.864 --> 19:01.030
Help is coming.

19:01.366 --> 19:04.142
All units, be advised, we have
an abduction in progress.

19:04.293 --> 19:06.869
The only location that fits
the hostage's description

19:06.888 --> 19:09.372
is Laurel Commons
in Rusk Heights.

19:09.390 --> 19:11.056
<i> All units, please respond.</i>

19:11.133 --> 19:13.234
(tires screeching)

19:22.904 --> 19:24.570
-OFFICER 1: Go, go, go, go!
-OFFICER 2: Move, move, move!

19:24.739 --> 19:27.723
ERT CAPTAIN:
Alright, listen up. There's nine
abandoned houses in the area.

19:27.725 --> 19:29.241
SWAT goes through them
one by one.

19:29.318 --> 19:30.334
OFFICER 3:
Eyes peeled!

19:30.336 --> 19:32.061
IRIS:
<i> I don't want to die.</i>

19:32.079 --> 19:34.154
It's okay, Iris.
They're gonna
get to you on time.

19:34.232 --> 19:35.898
Everyone else,
canvass any neighbors

19:35.991 --> 19:37.249
who might have seen something.

19:37.251 --> 19:39.427
OFFICER 1:
Quick. Check the back room.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.087
OFFICER 2:
Go, go, go, go!

19:42.164 --> 19:43.756
Police! Coming in!

19:43.908 --> 19:45.090
Move, move, move.

19:45.167 --> 19:46.517
OFFICER 3:
Make sure it's clear.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.761
Check the windows.

19:48.837 --> 19:50.170
-OFFICER 4: Bedroom's clear.
-GRACE:<i> Iris.</i>

19:50.190 --> 19:51.564
Make a sound for me.

19:52.934 --> 19:55.008
Iris, it doesn't
have to be much.

19:55.086 --> 19:57.010
I just need to know
you're with me still.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.346
-IRIS: (softly)<i> Uh-huh.</i>
-Okay, good.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.273
OFFICER:
<i> Nothing in this one.</i>

20:01.350 --> 20:04.760
Iris, can you see out of
a window from where you are?

20:04.762 --> 20:06.120
Clear!

20:08.433 --> 20:10.266
We've already gone through
six abandoned houses.

20:10.284 --> 20:12.710
Iris, is there a tree
outside of the window

20:12.861 --> 20:14.861
or power lines?

20:14.956 --> 20:17.048
IRIS:
<i> Boarded up. Sky.</i>

20:17.199 --> 20:18.865
Okay. Well, can you
hear anything?

20:18.943 --> 20:21.610
Maybe like an AC
or some wind chimes?

20:21.612 --> 20:23.095
(Iris gasps)

20:23.556 --> 20:24.972
Iris?

20:26.617 --> 20:27.874
Iris?

20:27.894 --> 20:29.727
IRIS:
(gasps)<i> He's awake.</i>

20:29.878 --> 20:31.145
(line disconnects)

20:31.731 --> 20:32.897
I lost her.

20:32.974 --> 20:34.214
This room's clear.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.125
GRACE: (on phone)
<i> Carlos, I lost connection.</i>

20:36.127 --> 20:37.568
(woman screams)

20:39.072 --> 20:40.887
OFFICER 1:
Move, move, move!

20:40.965 --> 20:42.965
OFFICER 2:
Go, go, go, go!

20:42.984 --> 20:44.992
OFFICER 3:
Police! We're coming in!

20:48.564 --> 20:50.322
-CARLOS: Iris?
-OFFICER 4: Clear!

20:50.399 --> 20:51.457
Iris!

20:55.404 --> 20:56.254
Iris!

20:56.405 --> 20:57.571
OFFICER 5:
Closet's clear.

20:57.648 --> 20:59.406
Hey. Hey, hey.

20:59.484 --> 21:00.424
Hey.

21:01.836 --> 21:03.219
Oh, thank God.

21:04.672 --> 21:05.838
Come on. Hey, hey.
I'm here.

21:05.914 --> 21:07.172
-I'm right here.
-Mm. Carlos...

21:07.325 --> 21:08.432
I've got you.
Okay.

21:15.666 --> 21:18.276
(indistinct radio chatter)

21:18.503 --> 21:20.444
(sirens wailing)

21:22.264 --> 21:23.764
OFFICER:
Let's go. Move, move, move.

21:23.766 --> 21:25.265
I was afraid
he was gonna--

21:25.343 --> 21:26.692
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:26.769 --> 21:28.435
It's okay, Iris, it's over.

21:28.454 --> 21:29.453
It's okay.

21:30.348 --> 21:31.122
(winces) Ow!

21:31.516 --> 21:32.848
Sorry. Sorry.
We have to clean this out.

21:32.867 --> 21:34.608
This might sting a little.

21:34.627 --> 21:35.960
BP's high, Cap. 160 over 90.

21:36.111 --> 21:37.628
-I'm not surprised.
-Is that bad?

21:37.780 --> 21:39.964
No, it's okay, Iris, alright?
We'll get it down.

21:40.115 --> 21:42.133
We just gotta get you
some oxygen.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.876
Alright, Iris, I'm gonna
need you to take

21:44.028 --> 21:46.545
some deep, slow breaths, okay?

21:46.697 --> 21:48.030
We're gonna take you in
for observation.

21:48.049 --> 21:49.031
She has a concussion.

21:49.367 --> 21:51.124
IRIS:
I was afraid
you wouldn't find me.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.051
It's okay.

21:52.219 --> 21:54.562
Just breathe, okay?
Just breathe.

21:59.894 --> 22:02.194
Reyes, can I see you a minute?

22:08.143 --> 22:10.453
I'll be right back.
I promise.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.667
How's she doing?

22:16.819 --> 22:19.244
Pretty shaken up,
but I think she'll be okay.

22:19.321 --> 22:20.563
Did we catch the guy?

22:20.656 --> 22:22.898
APD searched the house
top to bottom.

22:22.900 --> 22:24.750
There was no one inside.

22:24.902 --> 22:27.236
Well, he must be
in one of these houses,
in the backyards or something.

22:27.254 --> 22:29.405
We have the neighborhood
locked down
and we're sweeping,

22:29.407 --> 22:31.432
but we're not
finding anything so far.

22:32.927 --> 22:34.352
You think
we let him get away?

22:34.428 --> 22:37.063
♪ ♪

22:47.033 --> 22:48.532
O'BRIEN:
That's him. That's Andy.

22:48.684 --> 22:50.851
OWEN:
Does that date
mean anything to you?

22:50.945 --> 22:53.704
December 8th.
That's two days after
his last call with Joanne.

22:53.781 --> 22:56.432
Okay. So we know he was
alive two days after that.

22:56.450 --> 22:57.708
And he's still with the Dogs.

22:57.935 --> 22:59.543
Wait a minute.
How did you get this?

22:59.695 --> 23:01.437
Uh, I came across it.

23:01.455 --> 23:03.105
Did you steal this
from the FBI?

23:03.107 --> 23:04.289
I didn't say that.

23:04.366 --> 23:05.624
Look, as much
as I appreciate it,

23:05.776 --> 23:06.884
not a great idea, Owen.

23:07.111 --> 23:09.628
It wasn't an idea so much,
it was... an impulse.

23:09.780 --> 23:11.872
Look, I'm doing everything
they want me to do,

23:11.891 --> 23:13.707
including replanting this.

23:13.784 --> 23:15.059
And let me make sure it's off.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.453
Okay. Good.

23:17.471 --> 23:18.729
But once I put this
in the office, I'm done.

23:18.881 --> 23:20.789
And the Feds are gonna do
whatever they're gonna do.

23:20.791 --> 23:23.550
In the meantime,
let me help you
find your nephew.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.218
Why are you doing this?

23:25.296 --> 23:26.629
Because I know what it's like

23:26.647 --> 23:28.739
to have a dumb kid
go down the wrong path.

23:28.816 --> 23:31.984
This is a pretty darned
wrong path.

23:32.136 --> 23:33.077
And it's worse
than you think.

23:33.228 --> 23:34.728
Two days after
that photo was taken,

23:34.747 --> 23:36.305
a shipment of ammonium nitrate

23:36.307 --> 23:38.082
was stolen from a truck
outside of Laredo.

23:38.233 --> 23:40.567
Maybe your nephew knew about it.
Maybe it spooked him.

23:40.645 --> 23:43.087
The FBI says that they have
a source in the Honor Dogs,

23:43.164 --> 23:44.571
but the source
is gone unreachable.

23:44.649 --> 23:46.982
Wait, y-you think
Andy works with the Feds?

23:46.984 --> 23:47.816
I don't know.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.318
If he's made,
he's probably dead.

23:49.320 --> 23:50.653
Or in hiding.

23:50.655 --> 23:53.931
So this training facility,
do you know where it is?

23:54.082 --> 23:55.933
No. But I have heard
the members talk

23:56.084 --> 23:57.326
about this place
called The Farm.

23:57.344 --> 23:58.661
I figured
that's where they train.

23:58.663 --> 24:00.996
You can't get in there
unless you're branded.

24:01.015 --> 24:03.691
Well, we need to
find somebody who is
who can get us in.

24:08.430 --> 24:11.006
They didn't have jasmine, so...

24:11.099 --> 24:12.741
-Peppermint.
-CARLOS: You got it.

24:16.030 --> 24:18.122
You haven't found him yet,
have you?

24:18.958 --> 24:20.166
Not yet.

24:25.447 --> 24:28.782
We, uh, we just need you
to retrace your steps.

24:28.859 --> 24:31.210
See if you can remember
any detail that can help.

24:31.362 --> 24:34.046
This is Detective Grier.

24:34.122 --> 24:36.474
Hello, Iris.
How are you doing?

24:36.625 --> 24:38.809
Seriously?
What do you want,
a one-word answer?

24:38.961 --> 24:41.962
Iris.
She's here to help.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.314
Can you tell me
what you were doing

24:43.465 --> 24:45.390
out near
the encampment last night?

24:45.543 --> 24:46.875
I was looking for Donna Burton.

24:46.969 --> 24:49.820
She's one of our residents,
sometimes at the shelter.

24:49.897 --> 24:52.323
So you went looking for her
on your own at night?

24:52.399 --> 24:55.384
It's not like I was afraid.
I used to live at that camp.

24:55.402 --> 24:57.477
And that's where
he grabbed you.

24:57.497 --> 24:58.554
Right?

24:58.572 --> 24:59.646
Yeah, he...

24:59.724 --> 25:01.907
He came up to me and, um,

25:02.059 --> 25:03.650
I thought he was one of us,

25:03.728 --> 25:04.910
them, who needed help.

25:04.987 --> 25:07.913
But, I'd never seen him before,

25:07.990 --> 25:09.656
and, uh, and he forced me

25:09.675 --> 25:13.302
into the trunk
and he took me to that...
place.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.422
Before he ran away,

25:17.499 --> 25:20.017
anything stand out about
this man's appearance?

25:20.168 --> 25:23.412
I-I already told the sketch guy
everything I know.

25:23.430 --> 25:27.340
Tall, plain.
Creepy. Mustache.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.484
And he had a...

25:29.529 --> 25:30.361
a messed-up hand.

25:30.437 --> 25:31.529
Almost like it was burned.

25:31.531 --> 25:32.846
The left one.

25:32.865 --> 25:36.608
When he had you captive,
he didn't--

25:36.685 --> 25:38.244
He didn't do anything.

25:39.688 --> 25:42.206
He said I wasn't "ready yet."

25:43.601 --> 25:45.042
He just looked at me.

25:46.194 --> 25:49.362
Looked, like I was
a painting or something.

25:49.456 --> 25:54.200
And then he--
he put the mattress
against the door

25:54.278 --> 25:57.704
and he just sat there, looking.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.282
-He had a knife.
-Hm.

26:00.284 --> 26:01.708
And then he took a nap.

26:01.786 --> 26:03.619
IRIS:
He fell asleep, yes.

26:03.637 --> 26:05.954
I'd have to step
onto the mattress
to get to the door

26:05.973 --> 26:07.731
so there-- there wasn't
anything I could do.

26:07.808 --> 26:09.716
But he had a phone,
so I used it.

26:09.794 --> 26:12.218
And when the police found you,
you were unconscious.

26:12.296 --> 26:14.646
Do you remember what happened
right before that?

26:14.799 --> 26:16.556
How you got that gash?

26:16.634 --> 26:19.660
He woke up
and he slammed me
against the wall.

26:21.897 --> 26:24.415
And that's the last thing
I remember.

26:24.642 --> 26:26.709
So you didn't see
how he left the room?

26:28.495 --> 26:29.753
No.

26:31.406 --> 26:32.756
GRIER:
Thank you, Miss Blake.

26:32.908 --> 26:33.999
You rest up.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.760
I'll circle back if I have
further questions.

26:36.837 --> 26:39.263
Officer Reyes, a moment?

26:48.441 --> 26:49.756
You don't believe her, do you?

26:49.850 --> 26:51.442
I understand you have
a strong connection to her--

26:51.593 --> 26:53.669
You made up your mind
this morning before
you even found her.

26:53.762 --> 26:56.113
-I let the evidence
speak for itself.
-What's it telling you?

26:56.264 --> 26:58.674
That she wandered eight miles
to a random house,

26:58.676 --> 26:59.691
hit herself in the face?

26:59.785 --> 27:02.102
No sign of anyone
at that house.

27:02.179 --> 27:04.121
No car that supposedly
hauled her there.

27:04.198 --> 27:05.105
The bedroom door,

27:05.273 --> 27:08.459
the only door
in and out of that room.

27:08.535 --> 27:11.854
We had a drone
over the neighborhood
during the search.

27:11.856 --> 27:14.690
No one entered
or exited that house.

27:14.692 --> 27:16.467
Not until your team went in.

27:17.862 --> 27:19.261
She was alone.

27:22.700 --> 27:24.391
(indistinct chatter)

27:26.628 --> 27:28.354
(chatter continues)

27:31.542 --> 27:32.650
There he is. Turner.

27:32.843 --> 27:35.394
He's big, he's dumb,
and he loves to show off.

27:35.546 --> 27:37.404
Go, lose to him.

27:39.492 --> 27:40.699
What about the bug?

27:41.643 --> 27:42.993
I'll handle it.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.316
Hey, brother,
you up for a friendly game?

27:50.394 --> 27:53.153
No. But I'm happy
to whoop your ass

27:53.230 --> 27:54.338
and take your money.

Hey.

You can still win
some of this back.

Oh, yeah. How?

28:53.399 --> 28:55.566
You got the pink slip

No, I know when I'm beat.

28:57.294 --> 29:00.220
From now on, I'm gonna keep
all my shootin' at the range.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.554
Nobody beats me there.

29:01.632 --> 29:02.722
You don't say, huh?

29:02.816 --> 29:05.484
Crackshot Strand.
That's what they call me.

29:05.636 --> 29:06.994
Who calls you that?

29:07.562 --> 29:08.971
People.

29:08.973 --> 29:10.164
People?

29:10.916 --> 29:12.666
Well, these people...

29:13.978 --> 29:15.401
they ain't never seen me shoot.

29:15.479 --> 29:19.831
And I will go up against you
at any range, anytime,

29:19.984 --> 29:22.050
any day of the week.

29:22.820 --> 29:23.835
How about today?

29:23.912 --> 29:26.488
Well, today's a day of the week.

29:26.490 --> 29:27.689
I don't think
there's a range in Texas

29:27.691 --> 29:29.658
who would let you shoot
in your condition.

29:29.660 --> 29:32.160
Uh, hell, I can still shoot.

29:32.179 --> 29:33.996
Yeah. Maybe next time.

29:33.998 --> 29:36.774
No. Hey, listen.
Let's do it now.

29:37.001 --> 29:39.801
I know a place, but you gotta
promise not to tell anyone.

29:39.803 --> 29:42.237
Just gotta
leak the lizard first.

29:57.963 --> 30:00.172
(footsteps approaching)

30:04.878 --> 30:05.877
TOMMY: You okay?

30:05.954 --> 30:07.721
Um, Carlos just called me.

30:08.699 --> 30:10.699
He's at the hospital with Iris.

30:10.717 --> 30:14.219
Okay, that's good.
She's been through a lot.

30:14.371 --> 30:15.871
Did they catch that guy?

30:15.964 --> 30:17.314
You ready for this?

30:18.150 --> 30:20.067
There may not have been a guy.

30:20.969 --> 30:21.893
What do you mean?

30:22.046 --> 30:23.153
I was there when she gave

30:23.230 --> 30:24.880
the description to the police.

30:24.882 --> 30:29.117
Which might have just been
Iris' paranoid delusions.

30:30.054 --> 30:31.995
She had a nasty head wound.

30:32.906 --> 30:35.332
They had a drone up and...

30:35.483 --> 30:37.709
no one else
came out of that house, Cap.

30:38.395 --> 30:39.461
Oh.

30:40.506 --> 30:41.505
Oh, I see.

30:41.748 --> 30:44.675
I mean, I don't get it.
She was doing so well.

30:45.994 --> 30:48.345
I mean, she hadn't had
an episode in years.

30:48.496 --> 30:50.422
Well, mental illness
isn't something you cure.

30:50.498 --> 30:54.076
It's something that you treat,
but it's always there.

30:54.078 --> 30:55.260
And-and, yes, you can

30:55.262 --> 30:58.246
all of a sudden
be triggered again.

30:58.265 --> 31:00.566
There's a chance
I may have loaded the gun.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.038
I do not like that woman.

31:15.190 --> 31:16.264
You don't have to.

31:16.283 --> 31:18.116
She's just here
to work the case.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.543
She doesn't believe me,
does she?

31:19.620 --> 31:21.436
Well, a good detective
never takes a position

31:21.455 --> 31:22.528
on an investigation.

31:22.606 --> 31:24.106
Then she's not
a very good detective

31:24.199 --> 31:25.716
because her position
is that I'm lying.

31:25.867 --> 31:28.760
How is she supposed to find him
if she doesn't think he exists?

31:33.300 --> 31:34.374
Oh.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.393
You don't believe me either.

31:38.972 --> 31:41.456
Of course, I do.

31:41.458 --> 31:44.401
I really think you experienced
everything you said, Iris.

31:46.130 --> 31:49.314
In the tiny world
inside my head
full of oompa-loompas.

31:49.391 --> 31:50.482
That's the worst part
of mental illness.

31:50.634 --> 31:51.742
Doesn't matter
if you get better,

31:51.893 --> 31:53.076
it's the only thing
anyone ever sees

31:53.228 --> 31:54.494
when they look at you.

31:55.472 --> 31:56.622
Not me.

31:57.658 --> 31:58.640
Iris...

31:58.825 --> 32:01.067
we launched drones
above the neighborhood

32:01.086 --> 32:02.568
when we arrived.

32:02.570 --> 32:04.496
That was several minutes
before your call ended

32:04.572 --> 32:09.484
and we scoured the footage
and no one ever left that house.

32:09.486 --> 32:12.320
What about his phone
that they took into evidence?

32:12.322 --> 32:14.431
We couldn't get
anything off of it.

32:15.659 --> 32:18.751
I'm gonna ask you this
as your friend.

32:18.845 --> 32:20.328
Is there any chance
that your mind

32:20.330 --> 32:22.022
is playing tricks on you?

32:24.334 --> 32:26.592
I have been taking my meds.

32:26.687 --> 32:29.112
I was doing so much better,
wasn't I?

32:29.264 --> 32:30.948
You have.
You've been doing great.

32:31.024 --> 32:32.440
-Haven't I?
-Yeah.

32:33.268 --> 32:35.369
I can-- I can still smell him.

32:36.271 --> 32:39.039
It was like a flowery detergent.

32:40.867 --> 32:42.459
I can see him.

32:42.962 --> 32:44.544
I see his face.

32:50.360 --> 32:53.044
The mind is a petty thing.

32:53.197 --> 32:54.379
Just one little thread
gets pulled

32:54.497 --> 32:56.974
and everything starts shifting.

32:57.050 --> 32:58.517
You start doubting.

33:00.462 --> 33:03.296
That-- that coffee ring
on the counter.

33:03.373 --> 33:05.399
I mean, I didn't see anyone
put a cup there.

33:06.694 --> 33:09.060
Might have been a nurse
or maybe it was just me.

33:09.213 --> 33:10.303
That's not the point.

33:10.322 --> 33:11.971
I mean, but there's
probably an explanation,

33:12.049 --> 33:15.066
but every little thing
makes you start to doubt.

33:15.219 --> 33:16.885
Is this even a hospital?

33:16.887 --> 33:18.478
Is everyone lying to me?

33:18.497 --> 33:22.057
This one little tiny crack
of doubt just rips open

33:22.075 --> 33:24.084
and then everything
falls into it.

33:26.063 --> 33:27.421
Iris.

33:29.399 --> 33:32.067
I don't wanna be
in there again.

33:32.069 --> 33:33.552
It was so lonely.

could live here.

Yeah.

35:56.229 --> 35:57.487
Huh.

36:18.660 --> 36:20.677
Well, this is some pantry.

36:20.828 --> 36:23.421
I'm surprised the Feds can't
get 'em on gun charges alone.

36:23.573 --> 36:26.016
Well, you're assuming
any of this is illegal.

36:26.092 --> 36:27.517
I bet it's not.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.105
Well, that's not legal.

36:41.182 --> 36:43.349
So this is what the Feds
were looking for.

36:43.368 --> 36:46.261
14,000 pounds
of stolen ammonium nitrate.

36:46.279 --> 36:47.445

Parking garage again?

37:12.213 --> 37:14.380
Yes, the parking garage again.

37:14.399 --> 37:15.974
We found the ammonium nitrate.

37:16.126 --> 37:17.216
-"We"?
-Yes.

37:17.310 --> 37:18.884
It was in the most
obvious place imaginable.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.478
It was at The Farm, in a barn,

37:20.630 --> 37:22.480
where they keep their munitions
and where they train.

37:22.632 --> 37:23.723
You've been to The Farm?

37:23.742 --> 37:24.741
(scoffs) Yeah.

37:24.892 --> 37:25.967
It's a whole story.

37:25.986 --> 37:27.135
And I will tell you everything.

37:27.153 --> 37:30.472
Yes... you will.

-But not in a parking garage.
-(tires screech)

37:35.328 --> 37:37.328
-What is this?
-This is what happens

37:37.481 --> 37:38.980
when you remove
government property

37:38.999 --> 37:39.923
from a federal building.

37:40.074 --> 37:41.341
Load him up.

37:52.162 --> 37:53.461
(Owen exhales)

37:54.681 --> 37:56.498
You know I did everything
you asked me to, right?

37:56.558 --> 37:58.850
Yeah, and a few things
we didn't.

37:59.002 --> 38:01.611
It's kinda the problem.

38:01.763 --> 38:03.505
Okay, I'm telling you, you need
to get down to that farm,

38:03.507 --> 38:04.764
and you need to
get down there now.

38:04.783 --> 38:05.949
What you're
looking for is there.

38:06.176 --> 38:07.008
Oh, we did.

38:07.010 --> 38:08.100
Judge granted a warrant

38:08.194 --> 38:09.953
five minutes after
we took you into custody.

38:10.030 --> 38:11.288
We raided the whole place.

38:11.364 --> 38:13.272
Oh, well, then,
what am I doing sitting here?

38:13.350 --> 38:14.849
Because there was
nothing there, Owen.

38:14.868 --> 38:18.628
I mean, there were munitions,
guns, lots of guns, all legal.

38:18.780 --> 38:21.372
But no stolen ammonium nitrate.

38:21.525 --> 38:23.149
No, no.
I'm telling you, I saw it.

38:23.226 --> 38:24.526
I believe you.

38:24.619 --> 38:27.286
Well, then somebody
must have tipped them off.

38:27.306 --> 38:29.364
Yeah. You!

38:29.366 --> 38:30.365
Me?

38:30.367 --> 38:33.217
How much of what
we shared with you

38:33.370 --> 38:35.219
did you tell Sergeant O'Brien?

38:35.372 --> 38:37.205
Sergeant O'Brien
is not really one of 'em.

38:37.207 --> 38:38.464
The only reason he is in there

38:38.542 --> 38:40.375
is because he's looking
for his nephew.

38:40.393 --> 38:43.545
Which, if my guess is correct,
was your former source.

38:43.547 --> 38:46.731
Do you really think
I would reveal to you a source,

38:46.808 --> 38:48.158
former or otherwise?

38:48.309 --> 38:51.578
My point is, Sergeant O'Brien
is not an Honor Dog.

38:52.739 --> 38:54.389
No.

38:54.407 --> 38:57.625
He's just... a founding member.

38:59.563 --> 39:00.670
Okay, he didn't mention that.

39:00.747 --> 39:02.321
KACEY:
No, I don't suppose
he would have.

39:02.399 --> 39:04.966
How much
did you tell him, Owen?

39:05.993 --> 39:07.135
Everything?

39:08.013 --> 39:09.662
Look, this doesn't make sense.

39:09.681 --> 39:10.588
If he were one of them,

39:10.682 --> 39:12.090
why would he let me
just walk in

39:12.166 --> 39:13.257
to where they're storing
the ammonium?

39:13.410 --> 39:15.243
Because he wanted you to see it,

39:15.261 --> 39:16.761
and he wanted you
to tell us about it.

39:16.838 --> 39:19.597
He knew
we would raid the place
and find nothing.

39:19.599 --> 39:22.100
Before anyone
even sets foot in a courtroom,

39:22.252 --> 39:24.694
he's already discredited
our star witness.

39:26.423 --> 39:30.492
You were played, Captain,
and you lost.

39:33.020 --> 39:35.413
