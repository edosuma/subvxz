00:06.131 --> 00:09.551
**

00:14.514 --> 00:17.017
- You know, it'd be great
if you could warn me

00:17.058 --> 00:18.393
before you drift
like that.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.353
I fucking slammed my goddamn
head into the window.

00:20.395 --> 00:23.940
- I said, "Hang on."
- You say that all the time.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.900
"Hang on.
I'm taking a curb.

00:25.942 --> 00:27.235
Hang on.
It's a speed bump."

00:27.277 --> 00:28.862
I mean, at this point
it's meaningless.

00:28.903 --> 00:31.364
- I should be mad at you anyway.
The reason we got robbed

00:31.406 --> 00:33.491
is because you needed
a piss break again.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.161
- Oh, come on!
You also needed to pee.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.662
You sounded like a broken
fire hydrant back there.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.205
- [John Doe]
Ha! You were listening.

00:39.247 --> 00:40.790
- [Quiet]
It was so loud.

00:40.832 --> 00:43.501
I bet that vulture heard you
from three states away.

00:43.543 --> 00:46.921
What'd he take, anyway?
- Ooh, found it!

00:46.963 --> 00:49.674
[laughs]
- Are you serious?

00:49.716 --> 00:52.469
You almost got us killed
for a bunch of stupid CDs?

00:52.510 --> 00:55.638
- Stupid CDs? I've been building
this collection for a decade.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.932
I have more memories in here
than I do in here.

00:57.974 --> 00:59.517
And, I'll have you know,

00:59.559 --> 01:02.604
good music is worth
its weight in gold nowadays.

01:02.645 --> 01:05.148
Let's see what other CDs
this guy's got.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.984
DMX.
Got that.

01:08.026 --> 01:10.487
Dave Matthews Band.
Pass.

01:10.528 --> 01:12.947
Hm, I've ever seen
this one before.

01:12.989 --> 01:15.200
- Uh, it's pretty good.

01:15.241 --> 01:18.078
I mean, you'll hate it at first,
but it grows on you.

01:18.119 --> 01:19.245
Especially track two.

01:19.287 --> 01:22.040
- Track t--
You know the tracks?

01:22.082 --> 01:23.958
- What? No.
Shut up.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.211
- Should I toss it?
- No! No.

01:26.252 --> 01:30.090
I mean, keep it or not.
I don't care. Whatever.

01:30.131 --> 01:33.093
[chuckling]

01:33.134 --> 01:34.886
You know, we're not
far from Topeka.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.513
I can walk
the rest of the way.

01:36.554 --> 01:38.098
If you leave now,
you can probably make it

01:38.139 --> 01:39.432
to New Chicago
by nightfall.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.184
- A milkman's job
is never done

01:41.226 --> 01:43.019
until his package
is safely delivered

01:43.061 --> 01:46.189
to its final
destination.

01:46.231 --> 01:50.360
And I'm sure your brother
would have wanted that.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.737
Besides, you think
I'd come this far

01:52.779 --> 01:56.449
and not see the fabled
Topeka for myself?

01:56.491 --> 01:58.493
- Fine.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.995
If you're
dead set on it,

02:01.037 --> 02:03.957
how about one
for the road?

02:03.998 --> 02:06.918
["MMMBop"
by Hanson playing]

02:09.295 --> 02:12.507
[laughs]
- It was close.

02:12.549 --> 02:15.135
You gotta
follow through.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.053
Like this.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.930
- That's what
I'm doing.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.515
Like this.

02:35.613 --> 02:36.489
- Here.

02:40.535 --> 02:41.911
To the end of
our road together.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.543
- Mmm,

02:48.585 --> 02:52.380
now you're
just showing off.

02:52.422 --> 02:55.342
[music slowing]

03:01.222 --> 03:02.724
[groans]
[bottle breaks]

03:08.688 --> 03:10.231
- Sorry, John.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.108
I can't have you
coming with me.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.322
Sweet Dreams.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.036
* Yeah yeah *

03:41.179 --> 03:43.348
- Loquacious.

03:43.390 --> 03:47.018
Boy, you're a loquacious lad,
aren't you?

03:47.060 --> 03:48.311
[knocking]

03:50.605 --> 03:51.648
Come in!

03:51.690 --> 03:55.652
Jamie, Carl,
how's the search going?

03:55.694 --> 03:57.404
- We have yet to find
the Mapmaker,

03:57.445 --> 03:58.863
but we think
we're close.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.115
- I'm talking about
the Milkman

04:00.156 --> 04:03.451
and the four-fingered girl.
Where are they?

04:03.493 --> 04:05.453
- Uh, there's been
no sign of them

04:05.495 --> 04:07.288
since they
vacated the dam.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.541
- When they pop up,
we'll be ready.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.877
- Pop up? Hmm.

04:12.919 --> 04:16.673
So, pop up.

04:16.715 --> 04:20.593
[sighs]
Pop up.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.387
These two lawbreakers

04:22.429 --> 04:25.390
ran rip-shod through
my largest outpost.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.767
They killed
my second in command,

04:27.809 --> 04:29.561
beat his brains in.

04:29.602 --> 04:34.315
And you're waiting for them
to pop up?

04:34.357 --> 04:38.069
Are they pieces of bread,
Roberts?

04:38.111 --> 04:40.488
Are we making
fucking toast here?

04:40.530 --> 04:41.614
- Sir, what Carl meant
was that--

04:41.656 --> 04:42.782
- Shut the fuck up.

04:42.824 --> 04:46.161
They defied the law,
and they defied me.

04:46.202 --> 04:49.456
Now get out there
and look for them harder

04:49.497 --> 04:52.167
than if you were checking
your lover for body lice.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.377
- That's actually
my sister, sir.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.589
We have the same--
- I know what a sister is!

04:57.630 --> 05:01.885
Look, I want their bodies
hung from the rotunda

05:01.926 --> 05:03.470
by this weekend.

05:03.511 --> 05:04.721
Provide the people
of Topeka

05:04.763 --> 05:07.307
with some light
Friday night entertainment.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.851
What do you say?
- [both] Yes, sir.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.311
- Okay.

05:13.938 --> 05:14.939
Fuck off.

05:35.502 --> 05:39.214
* Ding dang dong

05:39.255 --> 05:41.132
Well, you look like a man

05:41.174 --> 05:43.343
who values top-shelf
entertainment.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.178
Want to see a show?

05:45.220 --> 05:46.429
- I don't care
about your show.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.890
I need to see
your ORL now.

05:51.685 --> 05:55.563
- My ORL.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.440
"Orl" what?

05:57.482 --> 05:59.234
- I'll bring you in.

05:59.275 --> 06:01.820
[growls]

06:01.861 --> 06:03.446
- I think...

06:03.488 --> 06:07.325
I'll bring myself in.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.744
[gagging]
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.496
[whimpering]

06:11.538 --> 06:13.790
I've really enjoyed
this conversation,

06:13.832 --> 06:17.877
but let's pull a pin in it,
shall we?

06:17.919 --> 06:21.172
[whimpering]

06:21.214 --> 06:22.340
[sighs]

06:22.382 --> 06:24.009
Now, don't go touching
that grenade.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.593
Very sensitive.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.262
Hope you got
some friends inside

06:27.303 --> 06:29.139
who appreciate
the arts.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.174

they found Shepard?

07:04.966 --> 07:07.260
- He killed himself, right?

07:07.302 --> 07:09.429
Shit's messed up, man.
- [Lawman #1] No.

07:09.471 --> 07:12.849
I heard a new recruit
found him half naked,

07:12.891 --> 07:16.061
hand on his pecker,
head busted to shit

07:16.102 --> 07:19.022
with a sexy schoolgirl
comic book next to him.

07:19.064 --> 07:22.025
- That's the most fantastic
thing I've ever heard.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.193
- [Lawman #1]
Right?

07:23.234 --> 07:25.111
- [Lawman #2] So Shepard
was a sex pervert?

07:25.153 --> 07:27.822
I mean, I kind of see it.
I do.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.244
- Oh, fuck me.
Ham again.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.537
- I'll eat that shit.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.373
What kind of side
you got?

07:36.414 --> 07:37.874
Got any chips
or puffy Cheetos?

07:37.916 --> 07:39.292
- [Lawman #1] Hey, don't you
worry about my sides.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.543
- [Lawman #2] I will.
I'll trade you.

07:40.585 --> 07:41.961
- [Lawman #1] I'm not
eating those peanuts.

07:42.003 --> 07:42.921
They're nasty.

08:41.771 --> 08:43.732
Who would do that
to a dog?

08:43.773 --> 08:46.359
Separating a dog
from his best friend.

08:46.401 --> 08:47.777
It's kind of like me and you.
I mean--

08:47.819 --> 08:49.487
I mean, you were
my best friend.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.947
Not that I'm calling you
a dog or nothing.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.449
You know, you can be
a mean bitch

Don't worry.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.743

09:36.785 --> 09:39.496

doesn't equate to health.

Second, objects fall
at the same speed

here all dead like,

begging for it.

put you back to sleep.

Ah!

Oh, I hope I didn't
accidentally kill you,

to save your life.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.078
The truth is, Topeka isn't
what I said it was.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.872
It's Stone's
headquarters.

13:08.913 --> 13:11.332
Killing Shepard
wasn't enough.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.793
Oh, by the way,
I killed Shepard at the dam.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.420
He was jerking off.
It was a whole thing.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.047
- Didn't need that detail.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.340
- [Quiet] At least
you didn't have to see it.

13:18.381 --> 13:19.632
Now that we're here,

13:19.674 --> 13:22.344
I gotta make sure Stone pays
for what he did.

13:22.385 --> 13:25.013
- I would have helped you
if you just told me.

13:25.055 --> 13:27.557
- [Quiet] I would have told you,
but this isn't your fight.

13:27.599 --> 13:28.850
Don't follow me.

13:28.892 --> 13:31.394
Finish your delivery
and live your new life.

13:31.436 --> 13:34.397
Be the first milkman
without an expiration date.

13:34.439 --> 13:35.607
Good luck.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.776
- That's actually
pretty sweet.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.194
- [Quiet]
And go fuck yourself.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.571
- Of course.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.740
I guess that's it then.

13:43.782 --> 13:46.534
Jell-O, Quiet,

13:46.576 --> 13:48.620
whatever the hell
your name was.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.376
- [Loud] Dude, what do you think
they're gonna do to you

13:54.417 --> 13:55.877
when they catch your ass?

13:55.919 --> 13:58.213
They're gonna kill you.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.590
They always said
you were the smart one,

14:00.632 --> 14:02.384
but, man, I don't know.

14:02.425 --> 14:03.760
If this was my idea,

14:03.802 --> 14:07.931
you'd call me
a goose-brained dunder fuck.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.349
- Oh, my God,
will you shut the hell up?!

14:09.391 --> 14:12.227
- Ha! Like that works.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.853
I thought you knew your brother
better than that.

14:13.895 --> 14:16.356
- You're not my brother.
You're just my imagination.

14:16.398 --> 14:19.025
- You got a fucked up
imagination.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.111
You gave me the bullet hole
and everything.

14:21.152 --> 14:23.655
Is this how you really
remember me?

14:26.950 --> 14:29.452
Ah, dope, right?

14:29.494 --> 14:32.706
But imagine me, like,
two feet taller and ripped.

14:32.747 --> 14:35.208
But not, like, too swole,
just enough to show definition.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.502
- Fuck off!
- You fucking miss this.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.631
- I do.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.091
- Same.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.927
I mean, being dead
is a total buzzkill.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.762
At least you have
the Milkman.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.765
- Oh, John was a giant pain
in my crack.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.852
- Dude, I'm literally
inside your brain,

14:53.893 --> 14:56.646
and I know that's not
what you really think.

14:56.688 --> 14:59.607
I mean, I know you've seen him
with his shirt off.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.485
Nice back, huh?

15:02.527 --> 15:03.695
What?

15:03.737 --> 15:06.114
God forbid you feel
anything other

15:06.156 --> 15:08.491
than explosive rage
for a second.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.493
- You died
five days ago.

15:10.535 --> 15:14.497
The rage is hard
to ignore.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.207
No fucking way.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.889
- It's a dumb statue.
Forget it.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.850
- Forget it? They think
he's a fucking hero.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.977
- Who gives a fuck
what they think?

15:36.019 --> 15:38.146
- [Jamie] Officer.
[banging]

15:38.188 --> 15:41.066
Your vehicle's assigned
to patrol duty.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.276
Why are you idling?

15:43.318 --> 15:44.569
- [Loud] You've got to
say something.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.446
Silence will get you
killed here, little bunny.

15:46.488 --> 15:49.074
- Oh, I was just admiring
our boss, ma'am.

15:50.867 --> 15:51.618
- Yeah.

15:58.583 --> 16:03.588
I don't, uh, recognize
your face, officer.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.881
Are you new?

16:04.923 --> 16:09.719
- Transferred recently.

16:09.761 --> 16:12.430
- Hmm.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.724
- She's on to you.
You've got to leave now.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.267
[tires squealing]

16:16.309 --> 16:18.728
[gunshots]

16:18.770 --> 16:20.563
[clicks]
- Fuck!

16:20.605 --> 16:35.453
**

16:46.506 --> 16:47.716
- Holy fuck.

16:50.135 --> 16:51.553
- You're not getting
out of here alive,

16:51.594 --> 16:53.888
you fucking traitor!

16:53.930 --> 16:56.182
[whimpering]

17:00.854 --> 17:02.147
- [Sweet Tooth]
Need a hand?

17:08.820 --> 17:10.405
Oh, I found this one
lying around,

17:10.447 --> 17:12.115
so you'll have to
get your own.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.746
- Thank you.

17:17.787 --> 17:21.708
- Ah, don't mention it.
I really enjoy my work.

17:21.750 --> 17:25.503
Hey, hold this.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.629
- Okay.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.762
- And I'm gonna be
back for that.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.555
Hmm-boop!

17:40.685 --> 17:43.646
So, uh,
what's your name?

17:43.688 --> 17:44.898
- Stu.

17:44.939 --> 17:47.400
- Stu. I like
the mouthfeel of that.

17:47.442 --> 17:50.945
Stu.

17:50.987 --> 17:54.574
I'm Sweet Tooth.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.951
Put her there!

17:56.993 --> 17:59.037
- Nice to meet you,
Mister, uh, Tooth.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.955
- Firm grip
you got there, Stu.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.416
Bet you have a lot of fun
with that.

18:03.458 --> 18:07.337
You know, Stu, I got a feeling
you and I are kindred spirits.

18:07.379 --> 18:09.255
- You think we're a lot
alike?

18:09.297 --> 18:12.676
- You bet I do.
- In, uh, in what way?

18:12.717 --> 18:16.680
- I mean, you're a big guy,
I'm a big guy.

18:16.721 --> 18:20.517
Your name starts with "S",
my name starts with "S".

18:20.558 --> 18:24.437
The S Brothers,
who would have thunk it?

18:24.479 --> 18:28.441
Uh, something catch
your peepers, Stuber?

18:28.483 --> 18:29.442
- [Stu] Yeah.

18:35.407 --> 18:39.703
I found Mike...
and Ikes.

18:39.744 --> 18:40.870
You want some?

18:40.912 --> 18:42.247
- Ooh, yucky.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.832
I'm a Skittles guy.

18:46.584 --> 18:59.848
**

18:59.889 --> 19:02.726
[engine revving]

19:06.855 --> 19:21.786
**

19:36.885 --> 19:51.816
**

19:51.816 --> 19:52.650
**

19:52.692 --> 19:54.611
- Let's haul ass,
Evelyn.

19:54.652 --> 19:55.695
Make up some time.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.704
- Five flatheads
on one lure?

20:04.746 --> 20:06.247
Just a basic spooner.

20:06.289 --> 20:07.916
- Best day of my life.

20:07.957 --> 20:10.710
They were really bitin'
that day.

20:10.752 --> 20:12.045
- [Stone] Best day of my life
is gonna be

20:12.087 --> 20:15.340
when I complete my collection
of state quarters.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.551
The world went to shit
before I could find Idaho.

20:18.593 --> 20:21.846
But you know what?
I'll get there.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.557
The Union
will be complete.

20:24.599 --> 20:26.309
- Finished.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.269
- I think the spot's
still there, Cliff.

20:28.311 --> 20:33.650
[chuckling]
- Oh, there it is.

20:33.692 --> 20:35.568
- [Jamie] Agent Stone,
come in, Agent Stone.

20:35.610 --> 20:37.654
We have a 146A.
- Be right back.

20:37.696 --> 20:40.365
- [Jamie] A woman with
a missing finger, sir.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.742
- What about
the milkman?

20:42.784 --> 20:43.827
- [Jamie] She's alone.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.453
We have two patrol cars
on her tail.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.330
- Don't worry,
we'll bring you her teeth.

20:47.372 --> 20:50.875
- Oh, Carl.
No, do not engage.

20:55.422 --> 20:58.758
It's time I made
an example of her myself.

20:58.800 --> 20:59.884
[sirens wailing]

20:59.926 --> 21:02.220
- You're caught!
You gotta fucking bail.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.431
- No, I can't leave
until Stone is dead.

21:04.472 --> 21:05.557
- The only one dead
is you

21:05.598 --> 21:06.766
if you don't leave
this fucking place.

21:06.808 --> 21:09.269
When I died, I gave you
a second chance.

21:09.310 --> 21:10.895
And you're
throwing it away.

21:14.399 --> 21:16.151
- You're right.

21:16.192 --> 21:17.318
Fuck this shit!

21:17.360 --> 21:18.862
[laughing]
- That's right!

21:18.903 --> 21:20.530
That's the fuck
what I'm talking about!

21:20.572 --> 21:21.948
Come on!

21:21.990 --> 21:23.366
- [Stone] Guard 22.

21:23.408 --> 21:25.869
[brakes squealing]

21:25.910 --> 21:27.954
Come in, please.

21:27.996 --> 21:30.665
What happened to your
loquacious boyfriend?

21:32.584 --> 21:36.379
Did he
bite the dust?

21:36.421 --> 21:39.257
I have people in position
to kill you right now,

21:39.299 --> 21:41.426
but I think I'm gonna
give you a choice.

21:41.468 --> 21:45.597
Although, you remember
how that went last time?

21:45.638 --> 21:48.308
You can run,
in which case

21:48.350 --> 21:50.518
we'll hunt you down
like a dog.

21:50.560 --> 21:53.980
Or, you and I
can get together

21:54.022 --> 21:55.940
and have
a little chat.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.233
Turn around

21:57.275 --> 21:59.903
and we can finally
settle this one on one.

21:59.944 --> 22:02.238
- [Loud] Sis,

22:02.280 --> 22:05.909
you don't have
to do this.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.452
- Shut up.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.457
[tires squealing]

22:12.499 --> 22:14.542
- [Stone] Haha, good.

22:14.584 --> 22:17.295
My men will
show you the way.

22:29.599 --> 22:30.183
- Aww, you remembered.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.479
Thanks, Stuby.

22:34.521 --> 22:39.109
So, where are you off to
now that you're a free man?

22:39.150 --> 22:41.986
- Honestly,
uh, not sure.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.530
After Seattle,
my friend and I

22:43.571 --> 22:45.198
were looking for
a place of our own.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.033
A Shangri-La, you know?

22:47.075 --> 22:48.243
- Absolutely.

22:48.284 --> 22:50.161
- But, uh, then
when I got here,

22:50.203 --> 22:52.455
he, uh, threw me
under the bus.

22:52.497 --> 22:55.542
- Oh, I've done that before.
Crunch!

22:55.583 --> 22:59.504
Never to a friend.
I'm not a monster.

22:59.546 --> 23:02.090
- Listen, uh,
what you did today,

23:02.132 --> 23:04.342
saving me like that,

23:04.384 --> 23:07.345
it's, uh, it's the first time
in a while

23:07.387 --> 23:11.349
anyone's had my back.
So, uh, thanks.

23:11.391 --> 23:14.227
- Well, hell, I mean,
you're a reject, I'm a reject,

23:14.269 --> 23:15.854
we got to look out
for each other.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.898
I mean, you are about to head
out into a dangerous world

23:18.940 --> 23:21.443
where there are
two types of people,

23:21.484 --> 23:26.656
those who kill
and those who get killed.

23:26.698 --> 23:28.366
I know you're no wolf,

23:28.408 --> 23:30.076
but there is gonna
come a time

23:30.118 --> 23:33.163
when you're gonna
need to bite.

23:33.204 --> 23:37.292
And even puppies
have fangs, Stu.

23:37.334 --> 23:40.378
- That sort of thing is just
hard for me, I guess.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.047
I'm sure
I'll figure it out.

23:42.088 --> 23:46.092
- Oh, well, I mean,
maybe you could,

23:46.134 --> 23:51.139
I don't know,
but, tag along with me,

23:51.181 --> 23:55.352
and I could help you
find your fangs.

23:59.731 --> 24:01.191
- Yeah.

24:01.232 --> 24:02.067
You know what?
What the hell?

24:02.108 --> 24:04.069
- You mean it?
- Yeah.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.613
- Fuck yes!
Get in there.

24:06.654 --> 24:11.701
Aww, the S Brothers,
gonna paint the town red.

24:11.743 --> 24:14.204
Whoa, you sit bitch,

24:14.245 --> 24:16.039
Harold's got shotgun.

24:16.081 --> 24:17.165
- Sorry.

24:20.043 --> 24:22.837
So, where are we
off to next?

24:22.879 --> 24:23.880
- Well,
I'm not really sure.

24:23.922 --> 24:25.924
I mean, it felt
so freeing,

24:25.965 --> 24:28.009
ripping into
those law assholes.

24:28.051 --> 24:29.344
And the applause.

24:29.386 --> 24:31.680
Nobody ever cheered for me
like that in Vegas.

24:33.848 --> 24:38.937
- You know, if you want
to chase that feeling,

24:38.978 --> 24:40.271
there are outposts
like this

24:40.313 --> 24:41.981
all up and down
these routes

24:42.023 --> 24:43.650
and all through
the Midwest.

24:43.692 --> 24:46.027
Each one of them is filled
with captives just like me,

24:46.069 --> 24:48.279
waiting to get
set free.

24:48.321 --> 24:51.783
You save 'em
and boom,

24:51.825 --> 24:54.452
you have fans
for life.

24:54.494 --> 24:59.582
- Hmm.
Fans for life.

24:59.624 --> 25:01.042
Oh, I like that.

25:01.084 --> 25:05.964
[laughing]

25:06.006 --> 25:10.552
[cheering]

25:10.593 --> 25:13.555
I don't, um, I don't really
have room for all you guys,

25:13.596 --> 25:15.515
so maybe
you should carpool.

25:21.730 --> 25:25.650
- [Stone] Fall back;
she's mine.

25:25.692 --> 25:34.492
**

25:34.534 --> 25:37.203
Welcome to
Thrills and Spills Park.

25:37.245 --> 25:40.248
I came here every weekend
growing up.

25:40.290 --> 25:43.626
Got my first pickle tickle
on the Ferris wheel.

25:43.668 --> 25:46.755
But you know what
my favorite was?

25:46.796 --> 25:51.843
The Midway,
because I love games.

25:51.885 --> 25:53.970
Don't you?

25:54.012 --> 25:55.430
- Gotcha.
