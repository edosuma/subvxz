WEBVTT

00:07.216 --> 00:09.093
Um, well,
it really wasn't

00:09.176 --> 00:11.137
until the Drake
versus Pusha T beef

00:11.220 --> 00:13.264
of 2017, that, uh,

00:13.347 --> 00:16.767
bringing up a secret love child
was-was-was fair game.

00:18.811 --> 00:20.855
Holy shit.

00:20.938 --> 00:21.897
What is it, dude?

00:21.981 --> 00:24.817
- Weston's dead!

00:24.900 --> 00:26.902
- Oh, shit!
- Uh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:26.986 --> 00:28.195
- Uh, car crash.

00:28.279 --> 00:30.364
Toxicology report
came back inconclusive.

00:30.448 --> 00:31.657
FairFactor's reporting

00:31.741 --> 00:33.576
Mr. Hernandez was
in the car, too!

00:33.659 --> 00:35.995
I'm not dead.
I'm right here.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.788
I can't believe he's gone.

00:37.872 --> 00:39.623
I already miss him so hard.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.459
I just hope he's up there
in principal heaven,

00:41.542 --> 00:43.210
just balls deep in angels.

00:43.294 --> 00:45.087
Oh, this is so awful.

00:45.171 --> 00:46.589
My grandpa died when I was six,

00:46.672 --> 00:49.258
and now he lives in
a Folgers jar on the mantel.

00:49.341 --> 00:52.928
the number one trending topic.

00:53.012 --> 00:55.347
Damn!
Arthur Wong broke 5,000 likes

00:55.431 --> 00:56.932
just for posting
an old detention slip.

00:57.016 --> 00:59.393
Shut the fuck up!
Melody's going live!

00:59.477 --> 01:02.605
Hey,
Fairfax fam, it's me, Melody.

01:02.688 --> 01:05.441
Um, obvi,
it's with great sadness

01:05.524 --> 01:07.234
and a supes heavy heart

01:07.318 --> 01:10.988
that I confirm
Principal Weston's death.

01:12.448 --> 01:14.408
I'll be leaning
on my Harpsichords

01:14.492 --> 01:17.745
and, of course, eating lots of
Nabisco Nilla Wafers.

01:17.828 --> 01:20.956
Swipe up and enter
promo code deadprincipal

01:21.040 --> 01:23.459
to get ten percent off
all Nabisco products

01:23.542 --> 01:26.045

01:26.128 --> 01:29.131
Nabisco Nilla Wafers,
simple goodness.

01:42.186 --> 01:44.647
- A Nilla Wafer
death announcement?

01:44.730 --> 01:46.398
So performative.
So desperate!

01:46.482 --> 01:48.234
How does Melody live
with herself?

01:48.317 --> 01:50.903
Totally. Did any of you catch
that promo code?

01:50.986 --> 01:53.739
'Cause... I'm gonna be
grieving a lot tonight.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.326
Dale, homey, you okay?

01:57.409 --> 01:59.829
No. I mean, yes.
I mean, no, not yes.

01:59.912 --> 02:02.248
I just... Oh,
I think I need a minute.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.416
Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey,
don't fight the tears, bruh.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.752
Denial is the first stage of
P. Diddy's stages of grief.

02:06.836 --> 02:10.548
- drop a sad
yet tasteful banger.

02:10.631 --> 02:14.718
- Man, P-Dubs' death is hitting
Fairfax hard, bruh.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.679
What?! Tommy G is
making charcoal ice cream

02:16.762 --> 02:18.180
in Weston's honor?

02:18.264 --> 02:20.224
Fuck, that's a delicious way
to honor somebody.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.768
You know what? I'm gonna
reactivate my grief hotline

02:22.852 --> 02:24.812
from when Yung Polluter died
for, like, three hours.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.897
That's how
I'm gonna honor Weston.

02:26.981 --> 02:28.232
- Good idea.
- Sick, D.

02:28.315 --> 02:31.318
Bro, everybody's doing
something except for us!

02:33.487 --> 02:35.865
Why, God, why?

02:35.948 --> 02:37.074
- You get that?

02:37.157 --> 02:39.118
Oh, God!

02:39.201 --> 02:41.287
Why are you crying, Dale?

02:41.370 --> 02:43.831
Because you hardly got
to know him.

02:45.541 --> 02:48.419
Dang it, poked myself
in the eye again.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.879
I'm such a klutz.

02:49.962 --> 02:53.340
Oh, God.

02:53.424 --> 02:55.259
Get it together, you dingus.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.552
Okay.

02:56.635 --> 02:59.513
Maybe I just need
some comfort food.

03:01.140 --> 03:02.683
Baked Bean Bar?

03:02.766 --> 03:04.435
Huh, I'm feeling better already.

03:07.897 --> 03:09.607
Whoa.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.358
Huh?

03:23.412 --> 03:25.998
Damn, that's gonna get him
at least, like, 20,000 likes.

03:26.081 --> 03:27.791
How are we gonna honor Weston,
bruh?

03:27.875 --> 03:29.627
I-I feel like people are waiting
for our response.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.587
- We're Westy's guys.
- You're right.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.047
What would Weston want us to do?

03:33.130 --> 03:35.341
For him? For us?

03:38.052 --> 03:39.720
He'd want us to go big.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.434
Operator 24601.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.561
Weston's your grief.
I'm your relief.

03:47.645 --> 03:49.730
<i>Um,</i>
<i>I'm just really upset</i>

03:49.813 --> 03:52.483
<i>because my Weston post isn't</i>
<i>popping off on the Gram</i>

03:52.566 --> 03:53.859
<i>- like I thought it would.</i>
- Are you serious?

03:53.943 --> 03:55.152
Try using better hashtags.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.988
This isn't an excuse
to go fishing for likes!

03:59.573 --> 04:01.033
Operator 24601.

04:01.116 --> 04:02.785
Weston's your grief.
I'm your relief.

04:02.868 --> 04:06.455
<i>So, I accidentally</i>
<i>posted about Weston twice,</i>

04:06.538 --> 04:08.707
<i>and I'm worried that</i>
<i>if I delete one of them,</i>

04:08.791 --> 04:11.293
<i>um, my followers will think</i>
<i>I'm insensitive.</i>

04:11.377 --> 04:13.545
I-I'm sorry.
This is a grief hotline.

04:13.629 --> 04:15.839
God! Y'all are thirsty as fuck
for death clout!

04:18.467 --> 04:20.594
Operator 24601.

04:20.678 --> 04:22.763
Weston's your grief.
I'm your relief.

04:26.058 --> 04:28.602
Hey. Hey, it's okay to cry.

04:28.686 --> 04:29.979
Look,
losing a principal can feel

04:30.062 --> 04:31.397
like losing a distant cousin.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.190
I totally understand
how you're feeling.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.402
<i>You do? Oh, my God.</i>
<i>That's so litty.</i>

04:36.485 --> 04:39.947
Oh, my God.
It's Melody.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.282
Yeah, just know
I'm here for you.

04:42.366 --> 04:44.868
Do you want to talk about
your favorite Weston memories?

04:44.952 --> 04:45.869
<i>Well, like,</i>

04:45.953 --> 04:47.621
not many people know this,

04:47.705 --> 04:50.290
but this one time,
he, like, shit his pants

04:50.374 --> 04:51.583
at the ice cream social.

04:51.667 --> 04:55.379
No way! Yo, savage!

04:55.462 --> 04:58.966
Yeah, it was so bad I had to
let him borrow my track pants.

04:59.049 --> 05:02.094
It was crazy, he wore them
to a school board meeting.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.971
Oh, my God, he did not!

05:05.514 --> 05:07.433
Hello?

05:07.516 --> 05:09.685
I-Is somebody there?

05:17.192 --> 05:19.319
Of course
your basic ass would buy

05:19.403 --> 05:20.696
the baked bean bar.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.865
Principal Weston?! But...

05:22.948 --> 05:25.075
But... you're dead.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.994
Nah, I just faked my own death

05:27.077 --> 05:29.163
and Parasited myself
in this here bunker,

05:29.246 --> 05:31.999
- just like the movie.
- I don't understand.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.709
Why would you fake
your own death?

05:33.792 --> 05:36.211
Pshh. Some IRS bullshit.

05:36.295 --> 05:38.088
- Huh?
- What do you want me to say?!

05:38.172 --> 05:39.506
I'm in over my head, Dale!

05:39.590 --> 05:41.550
I have 45 credit cards!
All Discover!

05:41.633 --> 05:44.344
The retractable arena roof
- came in 100
- K over budget,

05:44.428 --> 05:47.181
and the IRS is up my ass
until next Tuesday!

05:47.264 --> 05:48.599
What about your poor wife?

05:48.682 --> 05:50.142
You can't just pretend
you're dead.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.686
Look, I'm-a need you
to keep this between us.

05:52.770 --> 05:54.521
You picking up
what I'm putting down?

05:54.605 --> 05:55.981
But, Principal Weston...

05:56.065 --> 05:57.983
lying is against Scout code.

05:58.067 --> 05:59.651
I don't know
if I can keep this a secret.

05:59.735 --> 06:01.028
- You better keep it a secret!

06:01.111 --> 06:03.197
Otherwise, I'm-a tell
that little white girl,

06:03.280 --> 06:05.157
what's-her-name,
that you got a crush on her.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.909
You mean Lily?

06:06.992 --> 06:10.037
Bingo! Lily. I'm-a tell Lily
you got a crush on her.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.414
How do you even know that?
I haven't told anyone about her.

06:12.498 --> 06:14.083
I know what I need to know,
Dale!

06:14.166 --> 06:15.584
It's my principal training.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.087
Also, I'm-a need you to get me
some supplies.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.922
Just off the top of my head,

06:20.005 --> 06:21.548
Slim Jims, beard trimmer,
Prilosec,

06:21.632 --> 06:23.634
a 50-inch LED
with NFL Sunday Ticket,

06:23.717 --> 06:25.427
and one of
them Amazon Fire Sticks.

06:25.511 --> 06:28.305
<i>Young Putin's</i> coming back,
and I don't want to miss it.

06:28.388 --> 06:32.142
- It's like <i>Young Sheldon,</i>
but Russian and dangerous.
- But...

06:32.226 --> 06:34.019
But what, Dale?!

06:34.103 --> 06:35.646
Maybe I should just DM Cody

06:35.729 --> 06:37.231
and let him know
you're all about his girl.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.398
You wouldn't!

06:38.482 --> 06:40.234
- Wouldn't I?

06:40.317 --> 06:43.070
Oh, wait a minute. Hold on.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.489
- This can't be.
- Oh, God, what now?

06:46.698 --> 06:51.495
I'm trending!

06:53.664 --> 06:55.874
Whoa, ghost alert.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.462
Now, if you take a step
to your right,

07:00.546 --> 07:03.924
you'll notice Principal
Weston's personal bathroom.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.926
Feel free to snap a pic
on the throne.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.637
As you head out,
don't forget to tag

07:08.720 --> 07:10.472
your favorite sadbois,
Benny and Truman,

07:10.556 --> 07:12.474
using the hashtag
WestonExperience.

07:12.558 --> 07:15.102
And check out our SoundCloud
for an exclusive mixtape

07:15.185 --> 07:17.813
of unreleased

07:17.896 --> 07:19.148
<i>Weston After Death.</i>

07:26.405 --> 07:28.365
- Okay, I'm shutting down
this area

07:28.448 --> 07:30.868
- for official Triangle
ghost-hunting business.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.788
Hey, yo, bro.
We're mourning in here.

07:34.872 --> 07:37.249
Yeah, this is our tribute.
Get the hell out of here, Cody.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.585
You did the best you could,
and you failed.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.796
So here we go. Cub, let's get
a full EMP scan going.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.549
There, there, and, oh, that
looks like a very hot corner.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.301
Hunting Weston's ghost
is, like,

07:47.384 --> 07:48.760
such a great way to honor him.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.470
Yeah, way better than
Benny and Truman's thing.

07:50.554 --> 07:53.265
- That motherfucker.
- Damn, bro, now what?

07:53.348 --> 07:55.392
Ah, fuck.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.813
- Hey, dude.
- Hey, guys. Shot in the dark,
does anyone have

07:59.897 --> 08:02.024
an NFL Sunday Ticket login
I can borrow?

08:02.107 --> 08:03.859
Bruh, we didn't want
to say anything,

08:03.942 --> 08:06.486
- but it's a little sus
that you haven't posted yet.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.488
Yeah, dawg.
People are starting to talk.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.407
You were his only follower.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.909
- That's like next of kin.
- Uh...

08:11.992 --> 08:13.243
You guys will not believe
who I talked to

08:13.327 --> 08:14.369
on the grief hotline.

08:14.453 --> 08:15.996
Yo, isn't that
supposed to be anonymous?

08:16.079 --> 08:18.457
Melody. Turns out
she was contractually obligated

08:18.540 --> 08:21.084
to post the Nabisco ad and was,
like, super torn about it.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.794
God, I was so wrong about her.

08:22.878 --> 08:25.130
We talked for hours.
It was actually kind of magical.

08:25.214 --> 08:26.965
Like, we laughed, we cried.

08:27.049 --> 08:29.635
How do you guys think
I should play this?

08:29.718 --> 08:31.803
My instincts are
all over the place.

08:31.887 --> 08:33.472
Maybe go talk to her.
I don't know.

08:33.555 --> 08:35.390
Man, don't play games
with her, girl.

08:35.474 --> 08:36.725
You know she wants the D.

08:39.478 --> 08:40.729
You're totally right.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.648
She could probably use
an IRL friend right now.

08:42.731 --> 08:45.651
Can I, uh...
can I tell you guys something?

08:45.734 --> 08:47.402
It's ju...
it's been eating me alive.

08:47.486 --> 08:48.737
Ow!

08:53.533 --> 08:55.077
I, uh...

08:55.160 --> 08:57.412
I'm ready to post
about Principal Weston.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.873
Just wanted to see
if you guys had any thoughts.

08:59.957 --> 09:02.292
My thought is, as long
as you don't upstream us,

09:02.376 --> 09:03.794
I don't give a shit.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.004
Hey, Melody.

09:06.088 --> 09:07.339
Look, I just wanted to say,

09:07.422 --> 09:09.132
I know you and Weston
were close and...

09:09.216 --> 09:10.759
Hello, are you blind?

09:10.842 --> 09:12.302
Do you not see the line?

09:12.386 --> 09:13.470
Yeah!

09:13.553 --> 09:16.139
Hold up.
Are you signing Nilla Wafers?

09:16.223 --> 09:18.850
I can't begin to tell you
how problematic that is.

09:18.934 --> 09:21.603
Then don't. What are you,
the fucking grief police?

09:21.687 --> 09:22.980
No, I just...

09:23.063 --> 09:24.606
I thought you were different.

09:24.690 --> 09:27.567
Nope, I'm not. Bye, bitch.

09:30.070 --> 09:33.407
Hey, Dale. Are you doing okay?

09:33.490 --> 09:35.367
Um, I saw you crying earlier,
and...

09:35.450 --> 09:37.703
Oh, no, that? I just got
baked beans stuck in my eye.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.913
No, I-I actually think
it's-it's cool

09:39.997 --> 09:42.332
that you're in touch
with your feelings, you know?

09:42.416 --> 09:45.711
To be totally honest,
dating a prank lord like Cody,

09:45.794 --> 09:47.629
it's hard to know
how he really feels.

09:47.713 --> 09:50.007
Like, everything with him is
a joke, you know?

09:50.090 --> 09:53.176
Well, I'm always honest
with myself and others.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.554
What do we have here?

09:55.637 --> 09:58.682
Prilosec, Slim Jims,
a gas generator?

09:58.765 --> 10:01.310
This is all stuff Weston loves.
What are you doing with it?

10:01.393 --> 10:04.646
Huh, what am I doing with it?
What am I doing with it?

10:04.730 --> 10:07.524
I guess I just wanted to be
closer to him.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.319
I-I can't help but feel
like he's still in the school.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.446
You know,
trying to connect with me.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.990
And the Slim Jims help me
snap into my feelings.

10:21.413 --> 10:25.208
Sick. He's a medium,
ladies and gentlemen.

10:25.292 --> 10:28.587
- Wow, Dale.
That's so spiritual of you.
- Uh...

10:28.670 --> 10:31.131
Shu had the genius idea
to search every nook and cranny

10:31.214 --> 10:32.883
of this place
for Weston's ghost tonight.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.427
What do you say, huh?
We could really use a medium.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.637
Cub, let's hook Dale up
with a romper, okay?

10:37.721 --> 10:40.807
I'm thinking a kids' small.

10:40.891 --> 10:42.726
Oh, geez.
No, I-I don't know, Cody.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.354
- Are you sure
that's a good idea?
- Course I do.

10:45.437 --> 10:48.940
Come on, amigo. Let's turn
this triangle into a diamond.

10:49.024 --> 10:51.068
- But what about Lily?
- Don't worry about her.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.404
- She's my diamond.
- Cody!

10:54.488 --> 10:56.156
See you tonight, Dale.

10:56.239 --> 10:58.950
Uh... Okay. Okay.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.036
Dale, check it.

11:01.119 --> 11:02.829
Fairfax Chabad is sitting shiva

11:02.913 --> 11:04.873
for your boy,
and I ain't even Jewish.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.625
Mazel tov to you,
Principal Weston.

11:06.708 --> 11:08.126
That's very exciting,

11:08.210 --> 11:11.129
but what I'm about to say is
of the utmost importance.

11:11.213 --> 11:12.964
Cody and the Triangle are coming

11:13.048 --> 11:15.175
to honor/hunt your ghost
tonight.

11:15.258 --> 11:17.344
Under absolutely
no circumstances

11:17.427 --> 11:19.012
can you leave this bunker.

11:19.096 --> 11:21.973
- Hey! Are you even listening?
- Uh-huh, yeah. I got it, man.

11:22.057 --> 11:23.725
Just sit tight.
Now do me a favor

11:23.809 --> 11:25.811
and throw that flat screen up
on the wall over there.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.354
You brought the mount, right?

11:28.647 --> 11:30.273
I can't even keep up
with the posts!

11:30.357 --> 11:32.567
- My fingies are fast,
but this is insane.

11:32.651 --> 11:34.569
Bruh, it just won't stop.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.822
Yung Polluter just announced
the Litter Gang is doing

11:36.905 --> 11:38.323
an honorary
Hour of No Polluting.

11:38.407 --> 11:41.159
BTS just retweeted Jules
and 'Manda's TikTok tribute.

11:41.243 --> 11:43.412
We're getting buried
in the feed, man.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.580
That's it!

11:45.664 --> 11:46.665
That's how
we're gonna honor him.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.500
We're gonna bury
this motherfucker.

11:48.583 --> 11:51.002
We're gonna give him
the funeral of a lifetime.

11:51.086 --> 11:53.922
And who better to throw
the Super Bowl-level service

11:54.005 --> 11:56.174
- Weston would have wanted
than us?
- Okay.

11:56.258 --> 11:58.385
So just off the top of the dome,
I'm thinking like

11:58.468 --> 12:02.013
if Kanye's Sunday Service
fucked the NBA All-Star Weekend,

12:02.097 --> 12:04.391
- but sad.
- Yo, my G.

12:04.474 --> 12:08.061
When you are on,
you are on. Ha!

12:08.145 --> 12:09.563
You handle
the music and lighting.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.064
I'm gonna call my dove guy.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.067
Bitch gonna tell me
there's a line?

12:14.151 --> 12:16.695
- The only line you care about
is the bottom line!

12:16.778 --> 12:21.032
Oh. No. She. Did. Not. Ugh.

12:21.116 --> 12:22.617
Operator 24601.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.619
Weston's your grief.
I'm your relief.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.997
I'm sorry
I keep bothering you.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.249
It's just...
something happened

12:29.332 --> 12:31.001
<i>at school today.</i>

12:31.084 --> 12:33.086
I'm listening.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.130
I was so rude to this girl.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.507
Oh, okay.
Do you want to talk about it?

12:37.591 --> 12:39.551
Well, like, she came up to me
at lunch and, like,

12:39.634 --> 12:42.637
tried to be nice to me,
but I totally bitched her out.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.723
And I don't know
why I'm acting this way.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.893
Oh, honey, that's okay.
You're grieving.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.187
Everybody knows anger is
the third stage

12:50.270 --> 12:52.105
of the P. Diddy stages of grief.

12:52.189 --> 12:54.441
Well, this girl said
I was problematic.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.693
And honestly, like, she's right.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.111
I mean, she would know.

12:58.195 --> 13:01.114
She's, like, really smart
and, like, really woke.

13:01.198 --> 13:04.493
- I bet she is.
- I'm just so tied up
in being this influencer

13:04.576 --> 13:06.578
that I... I don't know,
I-I just...

13:06.661 --> 13:08.955
Lash out at people because
you're forced to put on a face

13:09.039 --> 13:11.416
- for all these brands?
- Exactly.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.210
God, you're so great to talk to.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.170
I feel like
you're the only person

13:15.253 --> 13:16.796
I can be myself with.

13:16.880 --> 13:20.550
Thanks. Um,
I like talking to you, too.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.890
Yesterday, Principal Weston's
spirit came to me, Cody,

13:26.973 --> 13:29.976
and asked me to help him
with some unfinished business.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.603
<i>- Business...</i>
<i>business...</i>

13:31.686 --> 13:35.482
<i>So now myself</i>
<i>and a team of experts</i>

13:35.565 --> 13:37.317
<i>are going to honor Weston</i>

13:37.400 --> 13:39.736
<i>the most charitable way</i>


13:39.819 --> 13:42.656
<i>by helping his ghost ascend</i>
<i>to principal heaven.</i>

13:42.739 --> 13:44.991
<i>- Or hell.</i>
<i>- We've locked the doors.</i>

13:45.075 --> 13:46.493
<i>We've cut the Wi-Fi.</i>

13:46.576 --> 13:50.163
<i>This is</i>
Impractical Ghosters.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.416
Mm. Mm.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.544
- Yo, Dale. Come here.
- Uh...

13:55.627 --> 13:58.046
Lily said she saw you crying
in the hallway earlier.

13:58.129 --> 14:01.174
If you ever want to cry
together, shoot me a DM.

14:01.258 --> 14:03.343
I'm always here for you.

14:05.303 --> 14:06.721
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

14:06.805 --> 14:08.139
Uh, you know what?
You guys go ahead.

14:08.223 --> 14:09.558
I'm gonna check over there.

14:09.641 --> 14:10.934
Getting a lot of
medium interference.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.185
Need a little space.

14:12.269 --> 14:14.229
Oh! Split up
to cover more ground.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.064
Good thinking.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.900
What are you doing
out of the bunker?

14:18.984 --> 14:20.193
They cut the Wi-Fi.

14:20.277 --> 14:21.570
You got to get out of here.

14:21.653 --> 14:22.988
The Triangle's gonna find you.

14:23.071 --> 14:26.074
Please, I'm begging you.
Lily's with them.

14:26.157 --> 14:28.326
Fine, nature boy.
Give me a boost.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.537
- Ow. Ow. Ah.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.163
- My neck doesn't bend that way.

14:33.164 --> 14:34.708
Wait. You guys hear that?

14:34.791 --> 14:36.376
Oh, no.

14:36.459 --> 14:39.087
Man, what the fuck am I gonna do
with gray doves, Frank?

14:39.170 --> 14:41.381
Service is tomorrow, man!
Give me them white bitches!

14:41.464 --> 14:43.550
Oh, ey,
what do you think, homey?

14:43.633 --> 14:46.136
V tasteful?
V exclusive? Hmm?

14:47.220 --> 14:49.264
Well, paint 'em white, Frank.

14:49.347 --> 14:50.765
This is a funeral!

14:57.188 --> 14:59.399
- Whoa.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.782
Oh, my God! What is happening?!

15:09.034 --> 15:10.869
Dale? Dale, bro?
Can you hear me?

15:10.952 --> 15:12.621
Hey, hey.
What it do?

15:12.704 --> 15:14.039
What it do, students?

15:14.122 --> 15:15.624
It's your boy P-Dubs.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.667
Holy fucking shit.

15:17.751 --> 15:20.837
Dale, our medium,
has gone full ghost face.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.757
- This is huge.
- And super problematic!

15:23.840 --> 15:25.216
Go.
Now.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.177
Thank you for
ghost-hunting for me, Cody.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.054
It's truly shown me
how much y'all care.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.598
Anyhoo, I'm ready to move on.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.600
Y'all have helped me
ascend to principal heaven

15:33.683 --> 15:36.853
where I will rest in peace.
Deuces, playas.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.860
- Dale!

15:43.943 --> 15:46.279
- Dale, are you okay?

15:46.363 --> 15:48.740
Whoa. What happened?

15:48.823 --> 15:51.576
Don't freak out,
but Weston just used your body

15:51.660 --> 15:54.412
as a vessel to help his spirit
peacefully transition

15:54.496 --> 15:55.872
to the other side.

15:57.791 --> 16:01.419
And that's how you honor
your dead principal, baby.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.798
Okay, say your <i>Harry Potter</i>
house on three.

16:04.881 --> 16:07.342
One, two, three.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.469
None.
J.K. Rowling is canceled.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.721
- Oh, my God. Yes!

16:13.056 --> 16:15.183
Wow, this funeral is going
to be intense.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.477
The invite looks
like a music festival lineup.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.979
Yeah, I'm glad
they're going balls to the wall.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.648
It's what
Weston would have wanted.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.775
Totally. So, listen, um...

16:23.858 --> 16:26.277
I know this is supposed to be
anonymous,

16:26.361 --> 16:29.447
but do you, like, maybe want
to sit together tomorrow?

16:29.531 --> 16:30.907
I never found
that shoulder to cry on,

16:30.990 --> 16:32.992
- and I bet yours is perfect.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.245
- Hello?

16:35.328 --> 16:37.622
Uh, yes, hi.
You know what?

16:37.706 --> 16:40.709
Um, if you leave a seat open,
I'll be there.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.293
Whew. Coast is clear.

16:42.377 --> 16:44.129
I cannot believe that worked.

16:44.212 --> 16:46.172
Okay, if you can just stay put

16:46.256 --> 16:48.341
until after this Friday Service
Benny and Truman are hosting,

16:48.425 --> 16:50.218
- I think we...
- Friday Service?!

16:50.301 --> 16:53.638
On campus?! For me?!
That's genius!

16:53.722 --> 16:55.932
I knew Benny and Tru
would come through!

16:56.015 --> 16:58.226
I got to be there, Dale!
You got to make it happen!

16:58.309 --> 17:01.438
Dude, nuh-uh,
Principal Weston, no way.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.856
I'm done helping you.

17:02.939 --> 17:06.234
Look at me, Dale!
I'm a man with no Wi-Fi!

17:06.317 --> 17:08.319
I got nothing left to lose!

17:08.403 --> 17:10.905
So, unless you want Lily
to know you write

17:10.989 --> 17:14.159
"Mrs. Lily & Dale Foster"
in your damn Trapper Keeper,

17:14.242 --> 17:17.537
you're gonna get me
into that funeral.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.756
- Uh...
- Do you think
Tyrese'll be there?

17:27.839 --> 17:30.091
He hit me with his car once,
so, you know, we kinda tight.

17:30.175 --> 17:32.427
I just want to restate
how bad of an idea this is.

17:32.510 --> 17:35.555
If you get caught,
the IRS will take you to jail.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.348
Nah, this plan is bulletproof.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.976
I'm-a pretend to be dead,
you slip me this air tank

17:40.059 --> 17:42.687
before they close the casket,
I enjoy the funeral,

17:42.771 --> 17:45.440
get buried, then boom,
you dig me up tomorrow morning.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.942
Are you hearing what
you're saying, Principal Weston?

17:48.026 --> 17:49.194
This is insane!

17:49.277 --> 17:50.528
Don't you understand, Dale?

17:50.612 --> 17:53.948
I make bad decisions!
That's what I do!

17:54.032 --> 17:56.826
Now help me sneak into the damn
coffin, you little bitch.

18:00.246 --> 18:03.208
We are going to remember Weston
so fucking hard today.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.877
Kleenex better come correct
with that sponsorship.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.220
Ah!

18:18.973 --> 18:21.935
Gross,
who okayed a fake body?

18:22.018 --> 18:23.728
Luis, I swear to God,

18:23.812 --> 18:26.022
I thought we was going
with a symbolic empty casket.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.148
This is disgusting.

18:27.649 --> 18:29.484
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.444
Places, people!
Let's go.

18:38.743 --> 18:42.038
- Fairfax, we mourning.

18:42.121 --> 18:46.793
We mourning a friend
and a mentor.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.795
We mourning a flawed,

18:48.878 --> 18:52.048
mortgaged-out-the-ass
motherfucker.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.176
But... we loved him.

18:55.260 --> 18:58.680
We loved him,
didn't we, Fairfax?

18:58.763 --> 19:03.726
Because he was our principal.

19:19.200 --> 19:22.537
Uh, uh, uh. Move, Tyrese.
I'm saving this for someone.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.542
Where is that little white boy?!

19:27.625 --> 19:29.294
Ah!

19:29.377 --> 19:31.004
What the hell is happening?

19:31.087 --> 19:33.673
When we heard Benny and Truman
were throwing a funeral

19:33.756 --> 19:37.302
for Weston, we knew
we had to up our grieving game.

19:37.385 --> 19:40.305
- Nobody out-grieves
the Triangle.
- Yeah!

19:40.388 --> 19:42.348
What better way to pay
our respects

19:42.432 --> 19:44.934
than with a flyover
parachute drop-in

19:45.018 --> 19:47.228
alongside Weston's
first follower

19:47.312 --> 19:49.981
and the homey
who helped his soul move on?

19:50.064 --> 19:52.025
I have to get back
to the funeral!

19:52.108 --> 19:53.109
They can't bury him!

19:53.192 --> 19:55.320
Fastest way back is down,
my man.

19:55.403 --> 19:56.738
- Let's go.
- What?

20:00.241 --> 20:04.370
And now, I will lead
the Esports team

20:04.454 --> 20:07.665
in a <i>Call of Duty</i> 21-gun salute.

20:07.749 --> 20:09.709
Ready! Salute.

20:11.252 --> 20:14.881
- Help! Help!

20:16.674 --> 20:20.053
Holy shit!

20:20.136 --> 20:21.721
Aah!

20:21.804 --> 20:25.099
Now, let us open
the retractable roof

20:25.183 --> 20:27.435
and release
the Doves of Remembrance

20:27.518 --> 20:30.563
as we lower Weston
into the earth.

20:34.317 --> 20:36.611
Didn't I meet you
at the Shelton-Stefani wedding

20:36.694 --> 20:37.987
in Malibu?

20:42.575 --> 20:46.871
Shit. Looks like I'm gonna get
my die on down here.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.336
Hey.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.505
Ugh, you again.
What do you want?

20:55.588 --> 20:58.591
It's me. Operator 24601.

21:00.051 --> 21:02.387
Weston's your grief.
I'm your relief.

21:02.470 --> 21:06.349
You? I... I wanted it to be...

21:06.432 --> 21:09.811
<i>- Fairfax Middle!</i>
<i>It's Cody and the Triangle.</i>

21:09.894 --> 21:11.229
<i>Coming to you live from the sky</i>

21:11.312 --> 21:12.855
<i>with Weston's</i>
<i>number one follower,</i>

21:12.939 --> 21:15.942
<i>- our boy Dale Rubin.</i>
<i>- Aah...!</i>

21:16.025 --> 21:18.695
<i>Look up to the sky</i>
<i>if you love Weston.</i>

21:18.778 --> 21:21.155
<i>And special thanks</i>
<i>to Benny and Truman</i>

21:21.239 --> 21:23.366
<i>for being our opening act.</i>

21:23.449 --> 21:25.118
<i>Very cute job.</i>

21:25.201 --> 21:27.495
That motherfucker.

21:29.288 --> 21:32.834
Cubby, hit 'em with a chemtrail.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.883
- Holy shit,
that's so much better

21:40.967 --> 21:42.427
than doves and fire dancers!

21:44.846 --> 21:47.932
No, no.

21:48.016 --> 21:50.768
Weston. Weston. No.

21:50.852 --> 21:54.897
No! I'm too late.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.233
He's really dead,
and it's all my fault!

21:57.316 --> 21:58.735
Aw...

21:58.818 --> 22:01.029
No. No!

22:03.114 --> 22:04.365
Get it together, Weston.

22:04.449 --> 22:05.616
You can't die.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.785
Imagine how sad
those kids would be.

22:09.370 --> 22:12.040
- Let it out, homey.

22:12.123 --> 22:14.292
I can't take it anymore!

22:14.375 --> 22:16.836
I can't stand the lies!

22:16.919 --> 22:18.713
I have a confession to make.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.673
- Principal Weston is...

22:20.757 --> 22:22.717
- Alive!

22:22.800 --> 22:24.343
- Aah!

22:24.427 --> 22:26.304
Relax, y'all, I'm not a zombie.

22:26.387 --> 22:28.222
I just faked my death.

22:28.306 --> 22:29.891
But I never would have

22:29.974 --> 22:32.143
if I knew how much you kids
cared about me.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.063
- Boo, you're a liar!

22:35.146 --> 22:36.898
- We liked you better
when you were just a memory.
- Liar.

22:36.981 --> 22:38.900
Ooh! Damn, B!

22:38.983 --> 22:40.485
Just when we were
about to blow up.

22:40.568 --> 22:42.111
I can no longer be associated
with this service.

22:42.195 --> 22:44.906
- Let's get the fuck
out of here.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.991
Where the hell were you
with the air tank, Dale?

22:47.075 --> 22:48.534
I almost died because of you.

22:48.618 --> 22:51.079
He knew
the whole frigging time?!

22:51.162 --> 22:54.957
- No, Lily. Wait!

22:55.041 --> 22:57.293
That is insane,
right?

22:57.376 --> 22:58.920
I'm so sorry. Where were we?
You were about to say

22:59.003 --> 23:01.005
that you meant all that stuff
you said to me on the phone?

23:01.089 --> 23:02.131
I don't know, Derica.

23:02.215 --> 23:03.508
This is all super weird.

23:03.591 --> 23:05.468
That was when Weston was dead.
I'm just...

23:05.551 --> 23:06.928
I'm just really confused
right now.

23:07.011 --> 23:09.764
I'm sorry. I just...
I have to go call Nabisco!

23:09.847 --> 23:12.058
- Wait, I...

23:13.559 --> 23:15.978
I'm handing out detentions
to anyone booing.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.564
Luis, you better put
that apple down.

23:18.648 --> 23:20.650
My nuts!

24:08.698 --> 24:10.658
Chirp.
