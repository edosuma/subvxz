WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.563
Previously on "Faking it"...

00:01.588 --> 00:02.846
Amy, you have to tell her the truth.

00:02.870 --> 00:03.750
I know. But how do I even begin?

00:03.775 --> 00:04.750
"Oh, by the way, I'm
sometimes attracted to guys

00:04.750 --> 00:05.648
and oh, I once slept with Liam."

00:05.673 --> 00:07.633
All these private sessions
are starting to pay off.

00:07.658 --> 00:09.368
I've seen Duke's abs all over Stubble.

00:09.393 --> 00:10.274
The gay hook-up app!

00:10.299 --> 00:12.032
Robin, my sister, is really my mother.

00:12.057 --> 00:13.165
And those two, my grandparents.

00:13.190 --> 00:14.548
They raised me as their son.

00:14.573 --> 00:16.498
Why don't you just go to his
new school and out him as a narc.

00:16.523 --> 00:17.805
He isn't who he says he is.

00:17.830 --> 00:18.790
- He's a narc!
- Narc!

00:21.795 --> 00:24.597
As you breathe in, really
connect with the earth.

00:24.599 --> 00:26.934
Only at Hester would we waste a P.E. unit

00:26.959 --> 00:28.559
on [bleep] tai chi.

00:28.584 --> 00:30.083
Damn it! Duke's on Stubbl again.

00:30.085 --> 00:31.651
Well, you're on Stubbl.

00:31.653 --> 00:33.200
But only to see if he is.

00:33.225 --> 00:35.425
Which he is... for the fourth time today.

00:35.427 --> 00:39.207
Shane Harvey... sounds like
you wanna be monogamous.

00:39.232 --> 00:40.626
What? Eew, no! Gross.

00:40.651 --> 00:42.851
We're gay. I just want him

00:42.876 --> 00:44.076
to only be gay for me.

00:44.633 --> 00:46.190
What are we...

00:46.215 --> 00:49.350
Hey. Sneak out Friday night.

00:49.375 --> 00:50.974
And bring handcuffs.

00:50.976 --> 00:52.475
Yes, ma'am.

00:52.477 --> 00:54.744
Anything specific you'd like me to wear?

00:54.746 --> 00:56.846
Uh... whatever you want.

00:56.848 --> 00:59.615
But I might get hot wax on it.

00:59.617 --> 01:01.017
Eew!

01:01.019 --> 01:03.186
You sure you two aren't back together?

01:03.188 --> 01:05.721
We just... have a thing.

01:05.723 --> 01:08.191
No commitment, no labels,

01:08.193 --> 01:09.893
no hurt feelings.

01:09.918 --> 01:11.671
Speaking of... how'd your conversation

01:11.696 --> 01:13.328
with Reagan go last night?

01:13.330 --> 01:15.163
She texted and said she couldn't make it.

01:15.165 --> 01:17.299
But don't worry... I'm gonna
head over there after school,

01:17.301 --> 01:19.567
and I'm gonna tell her everything.

01:19.569 --> 01:21.536
I'm just afraid she's
gonna break up with me.

01:21.538 --> 01:24.239
Just be honest. Maybe she'll understand.

01:24.241 --> 01:27.542
But... to be safe, if she
gives you anything to drink,

01:27.544 --> 01:28.743
don't take it.

01:28.745 --> 01:31.456
So you said you had something to tell me.

01:31.481 --> 01:32.881
What is it?

01:33.126 --> 01:35.025
Okay. Wow.

01:35.050 --> 01:39.287
Uh... all right, let's just
get right into it, shall we?

01:39.289 --> 01:42.369
Well, you see...

01:42.394 --> 01:44.119
Can we go somewhere a little more private?

01:44.144 --> 01:46.360
I have five roommates.
There is nowhere private.

01:46.362 --> 01:48.362
Don't worry. He can't hear anything.

01:48.364 --> 01:49.437
Hey, Marley!

01:49.462 --> 01:53.263
See? Now, tell me what you need to tell me.

01:55.914 --> 01:57.491
Okay. You know what? This can wait.

01:57.516 --> 01:59.906
Jesus. You're such a [bleep] coward.

02:00.075 --> 02:01.341
What are you talking about?

02:01.343 --> 02:02.804
I was outside your window last night

02:02.829 --> 02:04.329
when you were talking to Karma.

02:04.354 --> 02:06.054
After everything I've
been through with my ex,

02:06.079 --> 02:07.680
how could you not tell me you're into guys?

02:07.705 --> 02:10.616
Because I'm not sure I
am. I only slept with one.

02:10.639 --> 02:12.296
Oh, yeah, and he just happened to be

02:12.321 --> 02:13.820
the boyfriend of your best friend,

02:13.845 --> 02:15.523
the same best friend
you kept secret from me

02:15.548 --> 02:16.781
because you're in love with her,

02:16.806 --> 02:18.101
and supposedly, you're over that.

02:18.126 --> 02:19.500
- I am.
- And I'm supposed to

02:19.526 --> 02:21.777
believe you? After all these lies?

02:21.802 --> 02:24.470
- Karma's not a lesbian.
- Neither are you!

02:24.495 --> 02:25.743
I am!

02:28.336 --> 02:30.269
And you're just realizing this now?

02:30.271 --> 02:32.233
Part of questioning your sexuality

02:32.258 --> 02:33.893
is eventually getting the answer,

02:33.918 --> 02:36.688
and survey says: lesbian.

02:38.044 --> 02:39.087
Prove it.

02:41.000 --> 02:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:59.026 --> 03:01.265
It's so sweet of you to walk me to school.

03:01.290 --> 03:03.202
Yeah, except I've been here ten minutes,

03:03.227 --> 03:04.540
and we haven't left your room.

03:04.565 --> 03:06.031
Maybe I should just call in sick.

03:06.056 --> 03:08.892
Tempting, but I've gotta train.

03:08.917 --> 03:10.347
My first fight's next week.

03:10.371 --> 03:12.297
You've been training so much lately.

03:12.323 --> 03:13.766
I've barely seen you.

03:13.791 --> 03:16.574
Except on Stubbl.

03:16.599 --> 03:19.499
Hey, I've seen you on there a lot too.

03:19.501 --> 03:21.430
I mean, not that I care,
because you've always said,

03:21.455 --> 03:23.113
you know, monogamy's for
straight people, right?

03:23.138 --> 03:24.741
I have always said that.

03:24.766 --> 03:26.739
And you're fresh out of the closet.

03:26.741 --> 03:27.751
I don't want to keep you

03:27.776 --> 03:30.354
from checking out all the
other rooms in the house.

03:30.379 --> 03:32.749
So... I guess we're agreed.

03:32.774 --> 03:36.497
We're now officially
in an open relationship.

03:36.522 --> 03:38.089
Do they make a greeting card for that?

03:38.114 --> 03:39.657
If not, they totally should.

03:43.899 --> 03:45.796
You told her you were a lesbian.

03:45.821 --> 03:49.421
I'm a girl in a monogamous
relationship with another girl.

03:49.446 --> 03:50.587
What else would you call me?

03:50.612 --> 03:52.258
Uh, I'm gonna go with Amy.

03:52.283 --> 03:53.485
What about the fact

03:53.510 --> 03:55.120
that you're sometimes attracted to guys?

03:55.145 --> 03:56.540
That hasn't happened in ages.

03:56.565 --> 03:57.806
I think it's all cleared up.

03:57.830 --> 03:59.631
- Amy, it's not a rash.
- Can we focus

03:59.656 --> 04:00.923
on what's important here?

04:00.925 --> 04:02.813
College. Our dream of going to CU together

04:02.838 --> 04:04.782
is never gonna come true unless
we do something this summer

04:04.807 --> 04:06.541
that they find... "impressive."

04:07.087 --> 04:08.853
The big question is...

04:08.878 --> 04:09.905
what?

04:09.930 --> 04:12.006
Why don't we just ask her?

04:12.232 --> 04:13.506
Hello, ladies.

04:14.157 --> 04:16.101
Can I tell you a little bit about us?

04:16.125 --> 04:19.274
No need, no need... we both
knew we wanted to go to Clement

04:19.298 --> 04:21.485
ever since we were old enough
to know what college was.

04:21.510 --> 04:23.086
Not too big, not too small.

04:23.111 --> 04:24.610
World-class media documentary program...

04:24.635 --> 04:27.034
And it looks just like that
school from <i>Greek,</i>

04:27.059 --> 04:28.235
and I love that show.

04:28.260 --> 04:30.702
Well, you two should definitely consider

04:30.727 --> 04:32.586
our Summer Scholars program.

04:32.612 --> 04:35.040
You can audit classes, live in the dorms...

04:38.951 --> 04:40.652
Oh, um...

04:40.677 --> 04:42.360
How much does it cost?

04:42.385 --> 04:43.750
There's no cost to the student.

04:43.775 --> 04:46.852
At CU we want to find the
best and the brightest,

04:46.877 --> 04:48.579
and this is how we find them.

04:48.604 --> 04:49.803
- Sign us up!
- Yeah.

04:49.828 --> 04:51.665
Well, there is an application process.

04:51.690 --> 04:53.087
And the deadline is soon.

04:53.112 --> 04:54.512
Oh, right. Of course.

04:54.537 --> 04:55.910
Just curious...

04:56.012 --> 04:57.544
How many spots are there?

04:57.569 --> 04:59.829
- 30.
- Oh! For how many applicants?

04:59.854 --> 05:01.743
3,612.

05:01.768 --> 05:03.180
Those were last year's numbers.

05:03.205 --> 05:05.606
- Hi. I'm Lauren Cooper.
- Oh! Hello.

05:05.631 --> 05:07.531
I know you'll be meeting
hundreds of students today,

05:07.556 --> 05:09.219
and I want to be the one you'll remember.

05:09.244 --> 05:11.705
Here's my card. It lists
a smidge of who I am.

05:11.730 --> 05:14.235
Sophomore class president,
ballroom dancing champion,

05:14.260 --> 05:17.236
- social chair.
- "Friend to the elderly"?

05:17.261 --> 05:18.587
I go every Sunday.

05:18.612 --> 05:21.368
They're helping me as
much as I'm helping them.

05:21.428 --> 05:24.391
Mother[bleep]!

05:28.439 --> 05:31.009
- Lauren, let me explain.
- Is this some sort of joke?

05:31.034 --> 05:32.103
After you guys outed me,

05:32.127 --> 05:33.391
they wanted to send me to another school,

05:33.416 --> 05:34.454
so I requested a transfer.

05:34.479 --> 05:35.970
I don't want to lie to people for a living.

05:35.995 --> 05:38.462
Big whoop, what do you
want, a Nobel Peace Prize?

05:38.487 --> 05:39.907
Why the hell are you here?

05:39.932 --> 05:41.699
The chief's not happy about my decision,

05:41.724 --> 05:43.047
so he transferred me to Hester.

05:43.072 --> 05:44.727
[bleep] you, narc.

05:44.752 --> 05:46.550
'Sup, Brad?

05:48.370 --> 05:51.165
Look, I know you're not
ready to forgive me yet,

05:51.190 --> 05:54.532
but maybe this'll give me a
chance to make things right.

05:54.846 --> 05:56.530
I want you back.

05:56.555 --> 05:58.913
The fact that you even
think you have a chance

05:58.938 --> 06:01.673
shows you have no clue
how deeply you hurt me.

06:01.698 --> 06:03.865
Just stay the hell away!

06:08.502 --> 06:10.844
Hey, buddy. Quick question.

06:10.868 --> 06:11.993
What are you doing this summer?

06:11.993 --> 06:13.525
- Jackson? Why are you...
- Here?

06:13.527 --> 06:16.261
Just swinging through with
an answer to that question.

06:16.263 --> 06:18.759
- Pow!
- "Southwest Artist Collective"?

06:18.784 --> 06:20.617
Yeah, I run it with a bunch
of artist friends of mine.

06:20.642 --> 06:23.242
But I gotta warn ya... we
got no idea what we're doing.

06:23.612 --> 06:25.718
But we still got an eye for talent.

06:25.743 --> 06:27.142
Every student we've hosted

06:27.167 --> 06:29.433
has been accepted to the
art school of their choice.

06:29.458 --> 06:31.024
And I think you'd be a shoo-in.

06:31.166 --> 06:32.665
But, uh, but why me? I mean,

06:32.690 --> 06:34.224
you didn't really like my piece,

06:34.249 --> 06:35.815
and I already rejected you once.

06:35.840 --> 06:37.099
Well, let's just say you remind me

06:37.124 --> 06:38.649
a lot of myself when I was your age.

06:38.674 --> 06:40.473
Except with far superior skin.

06:40.498 --> 06:43.266
So, what do you say?

06:43.291 --> 06:45.872
I really wish I could, but I can't.

06:45.897 --> 06:48.097
Ouch. That's twice, Booker.

06:48.122 --> 06:49.473
Third time's a charm.

06:49.716 --> 06:51.573
Think about it.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.573
Um... care to explain?

06:54.598 --> 06:56.097
That's Jackson Lee, the artist

06:56.122 --> 06:57.273
who offered me that fellowship.

06:57.298 --> 06:59.298
Now wants me to apply
to his summer program.

06:59.323 --> 07:02.073
Well, looks like someone
found himself a sugar daddy!

07:03.857 --> 07:05.690
Oh, my God.

07:05.715 --> 07:08.372
Shane, Shane, I think he might be my dad!

07:09.594 --> 07:12.561
Okay. Extracurricular activities.

07:12.586 --> 07:14.253
We were Homecoming Queens.

07:14.278 --> 07:15.973
Yeah. That'll really wow 'em.

07:15.998 --> 07:17.953
At least you have straight As.

07:17.978 --> 07:20.645
I got a B- in Yarn Arts.

07:20.772 --> 07:23.574
What have I been doing with my life?

07:23.599 --> 07:25.398
Chasing boys and the approval of others.

07:25.674 --> 07:27.173
Hate to rain on your parade.

07:27.198 --> 07:29.017
Speaking of parade, what's
up with the twirling?

07:29.042 --> 07:31.976
Did you not hear that F bomb
I dropped on that Clement rep?

07:32.001 --> 07:34.435
I wanted to make a
strong impression, but...

07:34.460 --> 07:35.486
not like that.

07:35.511 --> 07:36.736
Oh, yeah. What did Theo say?

07:36.761 --> 07:37.993
Not talking about it.

07:38.018 --> 07:39.459
I'm focusing on my future.

07:39.484 --> 07:42.151
Tomorrow, I will make a
lasting second impression

07:42.176 --> 07:43.864
via my lifelong passion for baton.

07:43.889 --> 07:46.134
You don't have a lifelong
passion for baton.

07:46.159 --> 07:47.796
Uh, yeah, Amy, I do.

07:47.821 --> 07:50.031
I know that schools look
for students with passions,

07:50.056 --> 07:52.366
and applying to college
is a cutthroat process,

07:52.391 --> 07:54.485
as your... blank applications

07:54.510 --> 07:56.190
clearly show you're realizing.

07:56.215 --> 08:00.251
And unfortunately, you
two can't just fake it.

08:00.276 --> 08:00.989
Bye!

08:01.289 --> 08:04.289
Why not?

08:04.587 --> 08:07.590
Well, we are really good at it.

08:10.077 --> 08:11.881
Hello, Clement University!

08:11.906 --> 08:13.171
I'm Karma.

08:13.446 --> 08:15.053
And I'm Amy.

08:15.390 --> 08:17.763
We're passionate about nutrition!

08:17.796 --> 08:20.248
So passionate, we turned Amy's backyard

08:20.273 --> 08:21.748
into an organic garden.

08:21.773 --> 08:24.085
Where we grew... all of this.

08:24.232 --> 08:27.567
Apparently, we have green thumbs!

08:27.592 --> 08:31.126
And soon, we were growing
more than we could ever eat.

08:31.151 --> 08:33.183
So we started juicing.

08:35.017 --> 08:36.851
- Mmm!
- Mmm!

08:36.876 --> 08:38.210
Delicious!

08:38.235 --> 08:41.168
Our friends thought so too,

08:41.193 --> 08:43.655
and their friends... and their friends!

08:43.681 --> 08:45.481
But we couldn't charge them for it.

08:45.506 --> 08:46.905
It didn't feel right.

08:46.930 --> 08:49.621
So our friends started
a Kickstarter campaign

08:49.646 --> 08:51.646
and got us this juice truck.

08:51.671 --> 08:53.185
Hashtag blessed!

08:53.210 --> 08:55.886
We just wanna help people
live healthier lives.

08:55.911 --> 08:57.985
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:58.190 --> 08:59.929
You can't be serious.

08:59.954 --> 09:02.062
Okay, look, Felix,

09:02.087 --> 09:03.726
we don't need a lecture on honesty.

09:03.751 --> 09:06.027
We just need to know if
it's believable or not.

09:06.052 --> 09:07.952
Nope. Not even a little bit.

09:07.985 --> 09:08.742
Oh...

09:08.766 --> 09:10.423
And Meryl Streep here

09:10.448 --> 09:12.348
isn't really doing you any favors.

09:12.373 --> 09:13.740
Wha... hey!

09:13.765 --> 09:15.952
I'm a good actor!

09:15.977 --> 09:18.053
I beg to differ.

09:18.604 --> 09:20.003
Well,

09:20.028 --> 09:22.061
I made you believe I was attracted to you.

09:22.086 --> 09:23.343
Well, you obviously weren't acting,

09:23.368 --> 09:25.034
'cause you can't.

09:25.059 --> 09:27.296
Okay. Now your lips are just flapping.

09:27.321 --> 09:29.577
- You can go now.
- This is my room.

09:29.602 --> 09:32.600
Felix, just give us a moment.

09:36.171 --> 09:37.972
Are you attracted to Felix?

09:37.997 --> 09:40.228
Eew! No. Gross.

09:40.253 --> 09:41.476
But you heard him.

09:41.501 --> 09:43.234
We're never gonna in the
Clement summer program

09:43.259 --> 09:45.358
with this. We need a plan B.

09:50.195 --> 09:52.960
So she was a freshman
when Jackson was a senior.

09:52.985 --> 09:54.966
There might be some proof in
here that they knew each other.

09:54.991 --> 09:55.888
Just for the record,

09:55.912 --> 09:57.348
I think you're jumping to conclusions,

09:57.373 --> 09:59.570
and I'm worried you're
gonna end up disappointed.

09:59.595 --> 10:02.295
I'm just helping because
I need to distract myself

10:02.320 --> 10:04.840
from the fact that Duke
is supposed to be training.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.864
But instead, he's logged on to Stubbl!

10:06.889 --> 10:08.122
Why can't you just tell him

10:08.147 --> 10:09.270
you don't want an open relationship?

10:09.295 --> 10:10.043
Because I don't know

10:10.069 --> 10:11.768
if I can do monogamy.

10:14.027 --> 10:15.995
Holy [bleep].

10:16.880 --> 10:19.547
Grr! Young Jackson Lee was cute.

10:19.549 --> 10:21.380
And that's Robin in the same picture.

10:21.405 --> 10:23.724
That's proof! Shane... he's my dad!

10:23.749 --> 10:25.224
I don't know.

10:25.248 --> 10:27.148
I've been in plenty of pictures with people

10:27.173 --> 10:28.672
- I haven't impregnated.
- No, it all makes

10:28.697 --> 10:29.903
so much sense now!

10:29.928 --> 10:31.494
Being an artist is in my blood,

10:31.519 --> 10:32.630
and now my dad has come back

10:32.655 --> 10:34.655
to build some kind of relationship with me.

10:34.828 --> 10:36.887
I've dreamt about this moment.

10:36.912 --> 10:37.944
- Liam...
- Shh!

10:37.969 --> 10:39.106
When I dreamt about it,

10:39.131 --> 10:40.764
there was no talking.

10:44.295 --> 10:45.628
What?

10:45.653 --> 10:48.057
I just got some amazing news.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.982
Remember that punk band
I opened for last month?

10:50.007 --> 10:51.051
Oh, Pussy Explosion?

10:51.076 --> 10:52.442
They're going on tour this summer,

10:52.467 --> 10:53.817
and they want me to come with!

10:53.842 --> 10:56.243
No way! That's so cool!

10:56.268 --> 10:58.067
You know what'd be even cooler?

10:58.092 --> 10:59.740
If you came with me.

10:59.765 --> 11:01.199
- Me?
- The bass player

11:01.224 --> 11:02.997
just dumped her girlfriend.
There's room in the van!

11:03.022 --> 11:04.655
Uh, that sounds amazing.

11:04.991 --> 11:07.202
But I can't.

11:07.227 --> 11:08.961
I've gotta spend my summer

11:08.963 --> 11:11.336
doing something that'll look
good on my college application.

11:11.361 --> 11:13.016
Look, you say you want to be a film major

11:13.041 --> 11:15.469
to make documentaries. Why wait?

11:15.494 --> 11:17.813
Make one this summer! Shoot the tour!

11:17.838 --> 11:21.373
Think about it. We'll stay out all night,

11:21.375 --> 11:23.593
stay in bed all day.

11:23.618 --> 11:25.961
Live on doughnuts.

11:26.139 --> 11:28.573
I do love doughnuts.

11:31.851 --> 11:34.317
But Karma's...

11:34.342 --> 11:36.617
Seriously, Amy, you say
you want a future with me,

11:36.642 --> 11:39.290
but you keep planning one with her.

11:40.331 --> 11:42.719
Hey, can we talk?

11:42.744 --> 11:44.448
Now's really not a good time.

11:44.473 --> 11:45.939
Amy, I'm really worried about...

11:45.964 --> 11:47.230
That summer program?

11:47.255 --> 11:48.656
Uh...

11:48.681 --> 11:51.246
I-I say let's just forget about it.

11:51.271 --> 11:52.856
It's not worth the stress.

11:52.881 --> 11:55.118
What? W... Amy...

11:55.143 --> 11:56.651
You always said you
wanted to be a lifeguard.

11:56.676 --> 11:58.275
Maybe you should just do that.

11:58.277 --> 12:01.340
But you refuse to get a job
that requires a bathing suit.

12:01.365 --> 12:03.741
And I stick to that statement.

12:03.766 --> 12:06.690
But Reagan is going on tour this summer,

12:06.715 --> 12:08.948
and she invited me to come, so...

12:08.986 --> 12:10.986
maybe I'll just do that.

12:11.011 --> 12:12.778
What... you're kidding, right?

12:12.803 --> 12:14.227
What about getting into Clement?

12:14.252 --> 12:16.684
Um... maybe college

12:16.709 --> 12:18.575
just... isn't my thing.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.063
I gotta... I gotta go.

12:20.088 --> 12:22.118
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

12:22.143 --> 12:23.532
Wha...

12:23.557 --> 12:25.057
Amy!

12:28.204 --> 12:31.657
Look... I know why you're
trying to help me out.

12:32.408 --> 12:33.741
Oh, y-you do.

12:33.766 --> 12:35.938
- Yeah.
- This isn't how I planned it.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.517
I wanted to get to know you better

12:37.542 --> 12:39.110
before I said anything.

12:39.135 --> 12:41.515
You're not, uh... you're not mad?

12:41.540 --> 12:43.674
No! Why would I be mad? No, I'm excited!

12:43.676 --> 12:45.409
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

12:45.411 --> 12:47.280
Great. Okay. Then so am I.

12:47.305 --> 12:48.838
I just wish we'd met sooner.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.239
Wait, wait... are you saying it's too late?

12:50.241 --> 12:53.141
We'll make the most of
the time we have now.

12:53.143 --> 12:56.609
Okay, s-so you'll
introduce me to your dad?

12:56.611 --> 12:58.381
What?

12:58.406 --> 13:00.590
No, no. You're my dad.

13:00.615 --> 13:02.007
What? No.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.132
Wait, wait, who's your mom?

13:03.134 --> 13:04.366
- Robin Booker.
- No, no, no.

13:04.368 --> 13:05.485
I'm definitely not your dad.

13:05.510 --> 13:07.777
Then... why were you talking about,

13:07.802 --> 13:09.269
you know, getting to know me?

13:09.294 --> 13:12.595
I heard your family's commissioning a mural

13:12.620 --> 13:14.285
at the new Skwerkelplex in Sao Paolo,

13:14.310 --> 13:16.076
and I thought that if I was your mentor,

13:16.101 --> 13:17.391
you'd put in a good word.

13:17.416 --> 13:19.336
You don't care if I'm an artist at all.

13:19.361 --> 13:20.728
Look, sorry, kid, but...

13:20.753 --> 13:23.559
use it in your art.

13:25.947 --> 13:28.430
I'm passionate, determined,

13:28.455 --> 13:30.355
willing to take risks.

13:41.107 --> 13:44.349
Oh!

13:48.476 --> 13:50.494
I'm so sorry.

13:53.440 --> 13:54.740
May I begin again?

13:54.765 --> 13:56.439
No...  That won't be necessary.

13:56.464 --> 13:58.931
I can already tell that
you're right for the program.

13:58.956 --> 13:59.975
You can?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.858
Was it my "refuse to give up" attitude?

14:01.883 --> 14:03.585
Actually, it's come to my attention

14:03.610 --> 14:06.912
that you are Hester's
first out intersex student.

14:06.937 --> 14:09.203
And we value that kind
of diversity at Clement.

14:09.228 --> 14:11.428
Now, I can't promise anything,

14:11.453 --> 14:13.225
but I would be very surprised

14:13.250 --> 14:16.110
if you didn't win a spot this summer.

14:17.648 --> 14:19.515
Because of my body?

14:19.540 --> 14:21.974
No! No, because of your...

14:21.999 --> 14:23.199
uniqueness.

14:23.224 --> 14:26.909
Well, then I withdraw my application.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.610
If you'll excuse me.

14:32.885 --> 14:34.709
You have to watch this video.

14:34.734 --> 14:38.302
You made another one?
So you're still applying?

14:38.327 --> 14:40.594
Just watch.

14:48.967 --> 14:51.601
Then the two princesses have tea.

14:51.626 --> 14:53.727
No, Karma, this is college.

14:53.752 --> 14:55.572
They're reading books underneath the tree.

14:55.597 --> 14:57.163
But what about the prince?

14:57.188 --> 14:59.173
He's the professor.

14:59.198 --> 15:02.033
Here's your diploma.

15:03.582 --> 15:05.649
I know what you're doing.

15:05.674 --> 15:07.707
Good. I was afraid I was being too subtle.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.719
But that was over a million years ago.

15:09.744 --> 15:12.177
Amy... you wanted this yesterday.

15:12.202 --> 15:14.703
And you're gonna ditch
college because what...

15:14.728 --> 15:16.227
because Reagan asked you to?

15:16.252 --> 15:18.399
Of course not. But she
didn't go to college,

15:18.424 --> 15:19.640
and she's doing fine.

15:19.665 --> 15:21.055
She's also a lesbian,

15:21.080 --> 15:22.846
something we both know you're not.

15:22.871 --> 15:24.392
Well, tell it to my wardrobe.

15:24.417 --> 15:26.351
I saw the way you blushed around Felix.

15:26.376 --> 15:28.553
Not again with that.

15:28.578 --> 15:29.939
I'm not into Felix.

15:29.964 --> 15:32.009
And why are you so
against me being a lesbian?

15:32.034 --> 15:33.266
I'm not!

15:33.291 --> 15:35.392
I'm against you changing who you are

15:35.417 --> 15:37.690
to make someone else happy.

15:37.715 --> 15:40.502
Amy, the one thing you've always said is

15:40.527 --> 15:42.368
that you can't wait to get to college.

15:42.393 --> 15:45.261
You're just upset that I'm
not gonna be here this summer.

15:45.286 --> 15:47.552
Yeah. I'll admit.

15:47.926 --> 15:49.774
I wanna spend the summer together,

15:49.799 --> 15:51.937
doing things to get us into Clement.

15:51.962 --> 15:54.767
Reagan wants you to go on tour with her.

15:55.065 --> 15:57.555
What do you want?

16:00.652 --> 16:03.391
I don't want to lose her.

16:05.471 --> 16:09.373
Well, you can't lose yourself to keep her.

16:20.121 --> 16:21.701
I got your text...

16:22.210 --> 16:24.511
Why do you like me?

16:24.536 --> 16:26.542
What?

16:26.567 --> 16:28.747
You claim your feelings for me are real.

16:28.772 --> 16:30.450
You say you want me back. Tell me why.

16:30.475 --> 16:32.466
And don't you dare say
it's because I'm pretty.

16:32.490 --> 16:34.317
Though that can be one of your reasons.

16:34.342 --> 16:35.440
You're gorgeous.

16:35.465 --> 16:37.648
You're also a tenacious badass.

16:37.673 --> 16:40.226
You know what you want, and
you won't stop until you get it.

16:40.251 --> 16:41.651
You've been through some [bleep],

16:41.676 --> 16:43.799
but you refuse to see yourself as a victim.

16:49.654 --> 16:51.455
Okay. What else?

16:51.480 --> 16:53.650
Keep 'em coming.

16:55.165 --> 16:58.199
Our first stop is Dallas.
There's this barbecue joint

16:58.224 --> 16:59.591
that you're gonna love.

16:59.616 --> 17:02.116
- Reagan...
- And then we drive to Amarillo.

17:02.134 --> 17:04.534
Wait until you see Cadillac Ranch.

17:04.536 --> 17:08.872
Reagan, I can't go on the
road with you this summer.

17:10.708 --> 17:12.809
Let me guess... Karma talked you out of it?

17:12.810 --> 17:16.476
No. She just reminded me of who I am.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.481
And who is that, exactly?

17:19.684 --> 17:22.585
A sexually confused girl who...

17:22.587 --> 17:25.855
wants to go to college.

17:27.005 --> 17:29.740
So you're not a lesbian either.

17:29.898 --> 17:31.264
I don't know.

17:31.289 --> 17:33.393
The best answer I can give you is maybe.

17:33.662 --> 17:36.259
I'm sorry I don't have
everything figured out

17:36.284 --> 17:38.817
- like you do.
- Ha. Hardly.

17:39.372 --> 17:41.666
I don't have everything figured out,

17:41.691 --> 17:43.257
like...

17:43.282 --> 17:46.416
I have no idea how I'm gonna get over you.

17:50.190 --> 17:53.360
Um...

17:53.471 --> 17:55.604
Does this have to be the end?

17:55.763 --> 17:58.797
We're just in different places, Amy...

17:58.822 --> 18:01.657
as much as I wish we weren't.

18:03.038 --> 18:05.768
Me too.

18:11.521 --> 18:14.430
Can I have one last kiss?

18:39.438 --> 18:41.161
Hey, you're frisky.

18:41.186 --> 18:43.186
And here I thought you'd be exhausted.

18:43.211 --> 18:47.300
I mean, how many Duke groupies
did you get sweaty with tonight?

18:47.325 --> 18:50.300
Just a few... the normal amount.

18:55.475 --> 18:57.410
Wait, Duke, hold on!

18:57.435 --> 18:59.301
I can't stand the thought of you hooking up

18:59.326 --> 19:01.392
with other people behind our Dumpster.

19:01.417 --> 19:03.018
I only agreed to that

19:03.043 --> 19:05.339
because I thought that's what you wanted.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.011
- Really?
- I haven't even hooked up

19:07.036 --> 19:08.835
with anyone else since
we got back together.

19:09.025 --> 19:11.230
Then why are you always on Stubbl?

19:11.255 --> 19:13.579
To see if you are.

19:13.604 --> 19:16.029
Shut up! Me too.

19:19.735 --> 19:21.135
Shane...

19:21.333 --> 19:23.642
when I got outed and lost my sponsorship,

19:23.667 --> 19:26.277
it was the worst day of my life.

19:26.302 --> 19:28.678
You were the only one there for me.

19:28.703 --> 19:31.437
I love you.

19:31.526 --> 19:33.777
I'm not going anywhere.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.643
I love you too.

19:46.032 --> 19:49.678
I just can't believe it's over.

19:49.893 --> 19:51.692
For now.

19:51.717 --> 19:54.284
But you know, maybe someday soon,

19:54.309 --> 19:56.609
you'll be in that place

19:56.634 --> 19:59.716
and she'll be in that place and...

19:59.741 --> 20:02.909
it'll finally be right.

20:02.934 --> 20:04.701
I hope so.

20:07.238 --> 20:09.777
Will you stay over tonight?

20:13.184 --> 20:15.477
Yeah, of course.

20:16.445 --> 20:20.715
Were you gonna get waxy with Liam?

20:21.085 --> 20:24.419
You're more important.
