00:25.498 --> 00:28.635
<i>Deb or Deborah, never Debbie.</i>

00:29.836 --> 00:32.439
<i>Leave the faggy ties
at home, okay?</i>

00:32.840 --> 00:35.674
<i>I'm fuckin' this cat.
You just hold the legs.</i>

00:35.676 --> 00:36.674
<i>Got it?</i>

00:36.676 --> 00:38.643
<i>See you never, flame sauce.</i>

00:39.679 --> 00:42.948
She put the MILF
in Milford High.

00:42.950 --> 00:45.851
Now, she's behind bars!

00:45.853 --> 00:48.086
Debbie Ward, a former
Texas Teacher of the Year...

00:48.088 --> 00:50.254
...tried to rig
last year's contest

00:50.256 --> 00:51.690
so her daughter could win.

00:51.692 --> 00:53.091
Ow! Shit!

00:53.093 --> 00:54.925
Yeah, she kidnapped
her daughter's main rival,

00:54.927 --> 00:56.894
a Miss Bianca del Rio,

00:56.896 --> 00:59.531
who I was shocked
to find out was a dude.

00:59.533 --> 01:01.565
She basically
got our teacher fired

01:01.567 --> 01:02.634
for just being gay!

01:02.636 --> 01:05.202
That's when the notorious
New York homosexual

01:05.203 --> 01:09.541
returned to Milford High as
the fabulous Bianca del Rio.

01:09.543 --> 01:12.743
Now she don't even
look like a woman!

01:12.745 --> 01:16.213
What kind of unnatural woman?!

01:16.215 --> 01:17.282
He's biting me!

01:17.284 --> 01:19.918
A snake attack
at a local high school.

01:19.920 --> 01:22.954
Did her breast implants
save her life?

01:23.790 --> 01:27.626
Then Miss del Rio
got her revenge,

01:27.628 --> 01:29.261
and it was so good.

01:29.263 --> 01:30.895
This is not true!

01:30.897 --> 01:32.963
This is a conspiracy!

01:32.965 --> 01:35.032
<i>Vice Principal Deborah Ward
exposed as</i>

01:35.034 --> 01:36.800
the infamous Miss First.

01:36.802 --> 01:39.037
Taker of underaged
male virginities.

01:39.039 --> 01:40.704
Okay, you don't have to push me.

01:40.706 --> 01:43.574
<i>That tampering Texas temptress,
Debbie Ward,</i>

01:43.576 --> 01:45.609
maintains her innocence.

01:45.611 --> 01:49.681
And to this day insists that
Bianca del Rio, not she...

01:49.683 --> 01:54.021
...is the one who should be
locked up in the County Jail.

01:54.555 --> 01:55.853
Lock her up!

01:55.855 --> 01:57.154
Lock her up!

01:57.156 --> 01:59.157
Rise and shine, bitch!

01:59.159 --> 02:01.026
What are you doin' here?

02:01.028 --> 02:02.627
You wanted me punished?

02:02.629 --> 02:04.499
Well, here I am.

02:05.665 --> 02:07.832
Who'd have thought
they'd make us cellmates.

02:07.834 --> 02:10.101
Life's pretty fucked up,
isn't it?

02:10.103 --> 02:11.303
This can't be happenin'.

02:11.305 --> 02:12.870
We're gonna be prison pals.

02:12.872 --> 02:14.038
We're gonna eat together.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.973
We're gonna sleep
in the same cell.

02:15.975 --> 02:18.679
We're gonna watch
each other on the toilet.

02:19.246 --> 02:21.880
Help! Someone get me
out of here!

02:21.882 --> 02:24.848
We're gonna be together
a long time, you and I.

02:24.850 --> 02:26.250
No hard feelings, Debbie.

02:26.252 --> 02:28.286
I might even
give you a makeover.

02:28.288 --> 02:31.089
You'd look really pretty bald.

02:31.091 --> 02:33.725
Now, make sure
no one's coming,

02:33.727 --> 02:36.727
‘cause I've got to take
a huge dump,

02:36.729 --> 02:39.263
and boy is it is gonna stink!

02:45.838 --> 02:47.608
Bianca!

02:52.712 --> 02:55.947
One more night terror
for the road, I guess.

02:55.949 --> 02:57.151
Lucky you.

02:57.717 --> 02:58.750
Now get up.

02:58.752 --> 03:00.054
Time for your release.

03:12.164 --> 03:13.263
Take a seat.

03:13.265 --> 03:16.201
We just have some forms
for you to fill out and, uh,

03:16.203 --> 03:19.269
a little somethin' special
before you go.

03:19.271 --> 03:21.106
I just want to thank you.

03:21.108 --> 03:24.274
This whole experience has
been a revelation for me.

03:24.276 --> 03:25.876
I'm a new woman.

03:25.878 --> 03:27.144
Sure you are.

03:27.146 --> 03:30.649
You know I was worried that
bein' in solitary for so long

03:30.651 --> 03:33.118
that you might have missed out
on some of the pleasures

03:33.120 --> 03:35.153
that prison life has to offer.

03:35.155 --> 03:37.155
Oh, but I didn't.

03:37.157 --> 03:38.822
That first night in solitary,

03:38.824 --> 03:40.792
with the cockroaches
crawling around my ears,

03:40.794 --> 03:42.661
I didn't think
I was gonna make it.

03:42.663 --> 03:44.828
But then, I saw him.

03:44.830 --> 03:46.163
Saw who?

03:46.165 --> 03:48.333
My Lord and Savior,
Jesus Christ.

03:48.335 --> 03:51.001
I smashed a cockroach up against
the wall with my bare hands

03:51.003 --> 03:55.006
and there he was
in the goo, the face of Jesus!

03:55.008 --> 03:59.209
And right then,
I knew I was born again.

03:59.211 --> 04:00.745
Again.

04:00.747 --> 04:02.746
Okay, I don't think
that's a thing.

04:02.748 --> 04:03.815
Oh, it is.

04:03.817 --> 04:06.250
I baptized myself in
the toilet just to be sure.

04:06.252 --> 04:07.286
And now that I'm gettin' out,

04:07.288 --> 04:10.354
I'm gonna do the work
God intended me to do.

04:10.356 --> 04:12.092
Charity shit or somethin'?

04:12.925 --> 04:15.795
I'm gonna kill Bianca del Rio!

04:16.762 --> 04:18.096
Excuse me?

04:18.098 --> 04:19.363
With kindness.

04:19.365 --> 04:21.769
I'm gonna kill her
with Christian kindness.

04:26.740 --> 04:28.809
That's one crazy bitch.

04:30.009 --> 04:31.879
She can't even spell.
Look at this shit.

04:39.452 --> 04:41.721
Watch out, Bianca del Rio.

04:43.023 --> 04:45.225
I'm comin' for ya!

04:47.127 --> 04:48.963
Isn't anyone gonna pick me up?

04:51.764 --> 04:53.334
Ow! No!

06:37.036 --> 06:37.902
<i>No, no, Melanie.</i>

06:37.904 --> 06:40.137
I'm pretty sure
that the Earth is round.

06:40.139 --> 06:42.005
- Hey, Mr. Martinez?
- Uh, yeah.

06:42.007 --> 06:43.841
Can you tell me
about Sputnik again?

06:43.843 --> 06:46.010
Oh, look at you,
taking interest in class.

06:46.012 --> 06:47.911
Isn't Sputnik
Russian for potato?

06:47.913 --> 06:51.082
Well, actually, Sputnik was
launched in 1957.

06:51.084 --> 06:52.317
You remember that year...

06:52.319 --> 06:53.985
That was the year that your
grandmother slept with her uncle

06:53.987 --> 06:55.353
and gave birth
to your dad-cousin.

06:56.622 --> 06:58.990
- Bye, Mr. Martinez.
- Bye, kids.

06:58.992 --> 07:01.125
Listen, make sure you get
those term papers done.

07:01.127 --> 07:02.627
They are due in a week.

07:02.629 --> 07:04.495
And I know you potheads
don't want to spend

07:04.497 --> 07:06.467
your spring break
doing homework.

07:07.067 --> 07:09.033
Surprise, bitch!

07:09.035 --> 07:12.173
Oh! Oh, ho-ho!

07:13.139 --> 07:14.938
What are you doing here?

07:14.940 --> 07:18.108
And Rex.
Ooh... Ooh...

07:18.110 --> 07:19.944
Where is Bailey?

07:19.946 --> 07:22.613
Oh, honey, I left Bailey
kenneled up in New York City.

07:22.615 --> 07:23.514
She's fine.

07:23.516 --> 07:25.550
But Rex here
is a helpless baby person

07:25.552 --> 07:28.151
and she couldn't be
left alone, so tada!

07:28.153 --> 07:31.154
Hello, Rex.
How was rehab?

07:31.156 --> 07:33.358
This bar looks closed.

07:33.360 --> 07:35.093
That's ‘cause it's
a high school, baby.

07:35.095 --> 07:36.961
You expect Rex to know
what a high school is?

07:36.963 --> 07:39.163
He was educated
in a Barbie Dream House.

07:39.165 --> 07:41.399
When you pull the string,
the elevator goes up.

07:41.401 --> 07:43.433
Ooh, Science 101.

07:43.435 --> 07:45.469
Oh, Mama, it's gotten worse.

07:45.471 --> 07:47.272
I asked her for directions
on the way here.

07:47.274 --> 07:49.307
She pointed at the windshield
and said...

07:49.309 --> 07:51.308
We're going that way.

07:51.310 --> 07:54.077
Well, I'm glad to see
not much has changed.

07:54.079 --> 07:56.313
Especially not in this
small-ass Texas town.

07:56.315 --> 07:58.515
Bitch, it still looks like 1865.

07:58.517 --> 08:00.284
Why are you still here?

08:00.286 --> 08:02.553
Well, someone has to
teach these inbred twats

08:02.555 --> 08:05.522
that the world is older
than those pants.

08:05.524 --> 08:06.623
Really, girl?

08:06.625 --> 08:09.127
Navy blue capri-length
at your age?

08:09.129 --> 08:10.195
My age?

08:10.197 --> 08:12.430
You have been gone from
New York City for a while.

08:12.432 --> 08:14.031
These came back.

08:14.033 --> 08:16.601
This bar looks dead
and I finished my drink.

08:16.603 --> 08:19.103
Wait a minute. Have you
been drinking lighter fluid?

08:19.105 --> 08:21.538
I'm hoping that's just
alcohol in a flask

08:21.540 --> 08:25.142
because she downed the last
of my Xanax with that shit.

08:25.144 --> 08:27.077
Thought they were Mentos.

08:27.079 --> 08:28.346
The fresh maker.

08:28.348 --> 08:30.214
She should be dead, right?

08:30.216 --> 08:31.248
Years ago.

08:31.250 --> 08:33.583
Come on. Let's give you
a ride to your place.

08:33.586 --> 08:35.419
Come on, girl,
I got my car back!

08:35.422 --> 08:37.722
- Did you get your license back?
- Well, technically, no.

08:37.724 --> 08:41.558
Oh, come on, Rex baby.
Put her in back. Baby seat.

08:41.561 --> 08:42.893
<i>I think the lesson is:</i>

08:42.895 --> 08:46.998
make sure your husband's penis
isn't inside the sink drain

08:47.000 --> 08:49.334
before you turn on
the garbage disposal.

08:49.336 --> 08:51.435
Thanks for the tip!

08:51.437 --> 08:54.004
And later in the show
we've got Marsha Marshall,

08:54.006 --> 08:55.973
who is gonna show us
ten different ways

08:55.975 --> 08:58.175
to decorate your cat for Easter.

08:58.177 --> 08:59.344
Meow!

08:59.346 --> 09:03.547
But first, back in the news,
in the headlines, Russia.

09:03.549 --> 09:05.349
Vladimir Putin has assigned

09:05.351 --> 09:08.453
a new Prime Minister of
Homosexual Propaganda,

09:08.455 --> 09:10.354
Svetslap Zlopa━

09:10.356 --> 09:11.756
Svetlana Zlopasnost.

09:11.758 --> 09:14.328
Oh! Well, there you go.
That is a mouthful.

09:15.495 --> 09:18.128
Yikes!
She looks like fun at a party.

09:18.130 --> 09:19.497
Unless your party is gay,

09:19.499 --> 09:21.598
because those are illegal!

09:21.600 --> 09:23.434
That's right,
you Russian queers.

09:23.436 --> 09:26.704
Don't even think about
decorating your cat for Easter.

09:26.706 --> 09:28.739
You might land in jail.

09:28.741 --> 09:31.309
Does Russia
even celebrate Easter?

09:31.311 --> 09:33.514
Other countries
are just so weird.

09:33.779 --> 09:35.780
<i>Oh, don't talk bad about Russia</i>

09:35.782 --> 09:37.418
<i>They might hack your emails.</i>

09:38.350 --> 09:41.018
Mama, you're back!
What happened?

09:41.020 --> 09:42.186
They released me.

09:42.188 --> 09:44.522
No one was there to pick me
up, so I had to walk home.

09:44.524 --> 09:45.723
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

09:45.725 --> 09:47.157
It's okay.
Walk did me good.

09:47.159 --> 09:48.792
Gave me time to clear my head
and to think.

09:48.794 --> 09:51.396
I came up with six new ways

09:51.398 --> 09:54.331
to get Bianca del Rio fired
and out of our lives.

09:54.333 --> 09:58.102
All I need is a t-shirt cannon
and four live raccoons.

09:58.104 --> 09:59.771
Mama, you need to forget her.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.805
After the trial
and all that publicity,

10:01.807 --> 10:03.807
there's nothing the district
can do to get rid of her.

10:03.809 --> 10:05.075
It's over.

10:05.077 --> 10:06.411
No, no, no, no.

10:06.413 --> 10:08.246
I'm not gonna let
Bianca del Rio win.

10:08.248 --> 10:10.580
- Uh-uh!
- Well, we need money.

10:10.582 --> 10:12.416
We're two payments behind
on the mortgage.

10:12.418 --> 10:14.352
Rent-A-Center
repossessed the recliner.

10:14.354 --> 10:16.253
And remember
how my boobs popped?

10:16.255 --> 10:17.622
Of course.

10:17.624 --> 10:18.757
The doctors says if I can't
get on next season of “Botched”"

10:18.759 --> 10:22.160
it's gonna be $10,000
for reconstructive surgery.

10:22.162 --> 10:24.127
That's if I want them
the same size.

10:24.129 --> 10:25.796
- As before?
- As each other!

10:25.798 --> 10:27.464
Mama, we are broke.

10:27.466 --> 10:29.599
These little schemes of yours
just make things worse.

10:29.601 --> 10:31.169
Is this what you want?

10:31.171 --> 10:33.171
A world where freaks
and homosexuals

10:33.173 --> 10:35.138
get to do whatever they desire?

10:35.140 --> 10:36.206
Nuh-uh.

10:36.208 --> 10:39.243
I did not pray to
President Trump every morning

10:39.245 --> 10:42.345
to turn this country into
a big transgender toilet.

10:42.347 --> 10:44.648
How are we gonna
make America great again

10:44.650 --> 10:46.751
with Bianca del Rio still in it?

10:46.753 --> 10:47.618
Oh!

10:47.620 --> 10:49.222
Where's my chair?

10:49.755 --> 10:51.421
It's okay, Mama.

10:51.423 --> 10:52.790
We're gonna get you a job

10:52.792 --> 10:54.758
and we're gonna get back
on our feet again,

10:54.760 --> 10:56.393
get me back into a bra again.

10:56.395 --> 10:59.097
Oh, prison was so hard!
Carly, you don't even know!

10:59.099 --> 11:00.797
I'd eat soup with a spork.

11:00.799 --> 11:04.234
Our Christmas eggnog
was spiked with Old Spice.

11:04.236 --> 11:06.570
Gettin' revenge on Bianca

11:06.572 --> 11:08.805
was the only thing
gettin' me through.

11:08.807 --> 11:10.343
There, there, Mama.

11:11.878 --> 11:13.511
What are you watchin'?

11:13.513 --> 11:15.682
“Texas Today.”
I never miss a show.

11:17.149 --> 11:20.151
Some “human rights
activists” are mad

11:20.153 --> 11:21.853
because in Russia
they can throw anyone

11:21.855 --> 11:24.488
they even suspect of being gay

11:24.490 --> 11:26.656
in jail without a trial.

11:26.658 --> 11:27.858
Well, you know me.

11:27.860 --> 11:29.861
- I don't hate the homosexuals.
- No.

11:29.863 --> 11:33.164
Even after Roger burned my neck
with a curling iron last week -

11:33.166 --> 11:34.598
and I still think
it was on purpose.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.434
<i>But, you know, you could</i>

11:36.436 --> 11:38.569
still be fired here
just for bein' gay.

11:38.571 --> 11:41.405
But that doesn't mean
you have to be mad about it

11:41.407 --> 11:44.275
and start waving your hands
in the air with a hot iron.

11:44.277 --> 11:46.209
You should be grateful
for what you have.

11:46.211 --> 11:47.377
Exactly.

11:47.379 --> 11:50.781
Just because it's legal
to discriminate against anyone

11:50.783 --> 11:52.749
at a bakery anytime, anywhere,

11:52.751 --> 11:55.286
at least we're not
throwin' you in prison.

11:55.288 --> 11:56.219
Right.

11:56.221 --> 11:57.921
You think Texas is bad,

11:57.923 --> 12:01.492
you should try to go
to Saudi Arabia, Roger!

12:01.494 --> 12:02.859
It's worse than Russia.

12:02.861 --> 12:06.464
They throw homosexuals
off buildings there.

12:06.466 --> 12:09.536
<i>My God, that is not fun
and it's very humid.</i>

12:11.303 --> 12:12.703
Nice dress, Deborah.

12:12.705 --> 12:14.338
When Rent-A-Center
took your recliner,

12:14.340 --> 12:16.706
I see they left you
with the fabric.

12:33.725 --> 12:36.763
Maybe those terrorist Arabs
are onto something.

12:40.832 --> 12:42.666
Ah, great.

12:42.668 --> 12:45.902
Another episode of
"Little House on the Dreary."

12:45.904 --> 12:49.440
Where does Ma Ingalls
keep her moonshine?

12:49.442 --> 12:52.776
The alcohol's above the sink
in the kitchen.

12:52.778 --> 12:54.911
Anything under the sink
is poison.

12:54.913 --> 12:57.350
So help yourself to
whatever you want down there.

12:58.750 --> 13:01.919
I cannot believe that you
brought Rex in effect here.

13:01.921 --> 13:02.954
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:02.956 --> 13:05.690
Well, I thought he needed
a change of scenery,

13:05.692 --> 13:07.858
and he's not the only one.

13:07.860 --> 13:08.925
Seriously.

13:08.927 --> 13:10.393
Here you are.

13:10.395 --> 13:11.963
You're still
at that same school,

13:11.965 --> 13:14.831
still in this same
old raggedy-ass house.

13:14.833 --> 13:16.602
Uh, girl, I moved.

13:17.370 --> 13:19.903
Still in a new raggedy house,

13:19.905 --> 13:22.006
still with those glasses.

13:22.008 --> 13:24.675
And I know damn well that
Lasik has made it to Texas.

13:24.677 --> 13:27.445
Baby, you know they'll take
any excuse they can

13:27.447 --> 13:29.313
to shoot someone
in the face around here.

13:29.315 --> 13:32.315
I am so glad that you drove
all the way from Fire Island

13:32.317 --> 13:35.652
in a rented car
to criticize my life.

13:35.654 --> 13:36.988
Me, too, sis.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.421
Great catchin' up.

13:38.423 --> 13:40.690
Okay, listen.
I'm fine here.

13:40.692 --> 13:42.459
- Did ya get the raise?
- No.

13:42.461 --> 13:44.328
Sleepin' with the hot coach?

13:44.330 --> 13:46.530
- No!
- Then how is any of this fine?

13:46.532 --> 13:48.965
And I'm not even talkin' about
those hideous-ass curtains.

13:48.967 --> 13:50.868
- Ah...
- Listen.

13:50.870 --> 13:53.436
Bianca made you sort of famous.

13:53.438 --> 13:56.674
Well, gay famous,
which is like straight famous

13:56.676 --> 13:58.276
except you don't make
as much money.

13:58.278 --> 14:00.777
And in America, the only reason
to be famous is to -

14:00.779 --> 14:01.811
say it with me now -

14:01.813 --> 14:04.217
get laid and get paid.

14:04.884 --> 14:06.751
Yeah. I read your shirt.

14:06.753 --> 14:09.619
I made that shirt...
and this.

14:09.621 --> 14:11.022
I make things.

14:11.024 --> 14:13.726
I'm a maker...
the fresh maker.

14:15.662 --> 14:17.331
<i>Weeee!</i>

14:26.405 --> 14:28.439
Yeah... Uh, listen.

14:28.441 --> 14:30.874
You need more Bianca
in your life.

14:30.876 --> 14:34.078
No! Bianca is upstairs
in the closet where she belongs.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.012
Nobody wants to see
anymore Bianca,

14:36.014 --> 14:38.081
much less Bianca
teaching Chemistry.

14:38.083 --> 14:40.651
Bianca does not
just have to teach.

14:40.653 --> 14:43.554
Look, Ambrosia Salad's been
wearing that same ass-green wig

14:43.556 --> 14:45.790
and same broken-down heels
since Stonewall,

14:45.792 --> 14:48.425
and she's still making
the money, honey.

14:48.427 --> 14:50.493
What is so wrong with me
being here teaching?

14:50.495 --> 14:52.363
That's what I moved here to do.

14:52.365 --> 14:53.497
- Well...
- There's a...

14:53.499 --> 14:55.534
You know what!
Enough about me.

14:56.001 --> 14:57.667
Okay... Better question.

14:57.669 --> 14:59.502
Are you staying for dinner?

14:59.504 --> 15:03.773
Yes or no? Because I've got
a box of wine

15:03.775 --> 15:06.509
that isn't gonna drink itself.

15:06.511 --> 15:08.045
A girl's night in?

15:08.047 --> 15:09.046
Mm-hmm.

15:09.048 --> 15:10.815
You had me at box, bitch.

15:10.817 --> 15:12.550
Come on, girl.

15:12.552 --> 15:14.451
Don't shit in my skillet!

15:14.453 --> 15:15.488
Ooh, shit.

15:28.668 --> 15:30.037
I made coffee.

15:31.104 --> 15:34.041
What happened last night?
I can't remember anything.

15:35.774 --> 15:37.675
This is vodka!

15:37.677 --> 15:39.109
It's coffee-flavored.

15:39.111 --> 15:41.145
You bitches put me
through it last night

15:41.147 --> 15:42.879
and that is not helping.

15:42.881 --> 15:44.147
- Oh, girl.
- Oh!

15:44.149 --> 15:46.016
You're just out of practice,
that's all.

15:46.018 --> 15:49.052
Yeah. It's as easy
as falling off a bike.

15:49.054 --> 15:50.688
I never forget how.

15:50.690 --> 15:53.690
We had fun...
and you let loose.

15:53.692 --> 15:57.060
And we even got a little
Bianca del Rio up in there.

15:57.062 --> 16:00.430
What? Oh! God.

16:00.432 --> 16:03.934
Oh...
I'm not sure this is progress.

16:03.936 --> 16:07.504
I finally met the famous
Bianca del Rio.

16:07.506 --> 16:10.007
And she's a lot more fun
than you, believe me.

16:10.009 --> 16:11.142
Oh, shut up.

16:11.144 --> 16:13.844
Hey, wh-
what's with the bags?

16:13.846 --> 16:16.180
Under your eyes?

16:16.182 --> 16:17.614
Just passin' through, honey.

16:17.616 --> 16:18.681
Bye, girls.

16:18.683 --> 16:20.684
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

16:20.686 --> 16:21.919
Where are you going?

16:21.921 --> 16:23.357
Where are you going?!!

16:25.658 --> 16:28.057
I know you just didn't come
here for an intervention.

16:28.059 --> 16:29.693
No, but I could have.

16:29.695 --> 16:30.861
Now sister, listen.

16:30.863 --> 16:31.862
What I say next to you,

16:31.864 --> 16:33.930
I say with the light of
the sweet Baby Jesus.

16:33.932 --> 16:35.699
Look at what you've become -

16:35.701 --> 16:38.835
an elderly woman living alone
on a fixed income.

16:38.837 --> 16:40.905
You make money, but you
never make enough to leave.

16:40.907 --> 16:42.605
That's called Texas Holdem.

16:42.607 --> 16:45.511
I think I have a deck
of cards in my ass.

16:46.178 --> 16:48.878
Look, I'm from here.
I know how it is.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.915
Pull Bianca
out of that genie bottle

16:50.917 --> 16:52.849
and make your escape now.

16:52.851 --> 16:53.917
Oh, great!

16:53.919 --> 16:55.853
And just go back to New York
with the two of you?

16:55.855 --> 16:57.121
Oh, not New York, honey.

16:57.123 --> 16:59.556
I am going to Hollywood.

16:59.558 --> 17:01.791
Well, technically,
Long Beach, but...

17:01.793 --> 17:05.195
It's like Hollywood
but for lesbians and fat people.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.998
I'm performing on a cruise ship.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.166
Cruise ship? How are you gonna
take Rex on a cruise ship?

17:10.169 --> 17:12.603
He can barely
stand up on dry land.

17:12.605 --> 17:14.204
Oh, I'm not going.

17:14.207 --> 17:16.207
I'm staying here with you.

17:16.209 --> 17:17.507
Oh, no, no, no, no!

17:17.509 --> 17:19.142
- No, no.
- <i>Ah, yes.</i>

17:19.144 --> 17:21.478
No! You are <i>not</i>
leaving me with this thing!

17:21.480 --> 17:24.815
Maybe the sweet Texas sun
has made your brain soft.

17:24.817 --> 17:26.916
Rex is your problem;
Bailey is mine.

17:26.919 --> 17:27.852
That's how this whole

17:27.854 --> 17:30.988
Little Sisters, Big Messes
program works.

17:30.990 --> 17:32.890
I have been gone
for over a year.

17:32.892 --> 17:34.624
Rex is no longer my problem.

17:34.626 --> 17:37.827
When you temporarily left,
you took your little goldfish,

17:37.829 --> 17:40.698
but you left your
not-quite fish with me.

17:40.700 --> 17:44.067
Now I've got bigger fish to fry,
so Rex is yours again.

17:44.069 --> 17:45.702
I'm fine.

17:45.704 --> 17:47.805
I just need some electrolytes.

17:47.807 --> 17:49.507
- No, no, no, no...
- Oh, yes...

17:49.509 --> 17:50.341
Get out of my car!

17:50.343 --> 17:52.242
You did not
bring him here before.

17:52.244 --> 17:53.844
Why are you
bringing him here now?

17:53.846 --> 17:55.679
Because before he had a man,

17:55.681 --> 17:57.815
but since he swallowed
that bag of pennies, well...

17:57.817 --> 18:01.084
Is this Red Bull or Gatorade?

18:01.086 --> 18:03.853
That's antifreeze!
Get away from there!

18:03.855 --> 18:06.222
Ha, ha! I told you
you'd be a good mom,

18:06.224 --> 18:08.225
and not just because
of your hips.

18:08.227 --> 18:09.759
Your life was empty.

18:09.761 --> 18:11.027
I gave it purpose.

18:11.029 --> 18:11.828
You're welcome, bitch.

18:11.830 --> 18:13.831
- No, no, no, no.
- You're welcome!

18:13.833 --> 18:15.665
- Do not do this to me.
- I'm goin', bitch.

18:15.667 --> 18:16.801
Do not do this to me.

18:16.803 --> 18:18.835
- Write me on the cruise.
- Stephen, this is not fair!

18:18.837 --> 18:21.738
<i>I hope you fall on
the propeller, you nasty bitch.</i>

18:21.740 --> 18:22.875
- <i>No!</i>
- <i>Oh, yes!</i>

18:24.076 --> 18:26.075
<i>I'll never let go, Jack.</i>

18:26.077 --> 18:27.580
Go fish!

18:32.718 --> 18:33.787
Fuck!

18:34.720 --> 18:36.021
Weee!

18:38.624 --> 18:40.724
I thought you were
nocturnal creatures.

18:40.726 --> 18:42.325
Go on, get out of here!
Get out of here!

18:42.327 --> 18:44.763
Keep your Bianca faces
away from me.

18:50.269 --> 18:51.802
Look, Mama.
I'm pretty again.

18:51.804 --> 18:52.769
Yeah. It looks like

18:52.771 --> 18:54.705
you're smuggling
fenders across the border.

18:54.707 --> 18:56.006
Don't worry, Carly.

18:56.008 --> 18:57.708
You'll get your
real fake boobs soon.

18:57.710 --> 18:58.909
I've got a plan.

18:58.911 --> 18:59.844
A job plan, right?

18:59.846 --> 19:01.844
Not an overly
complicated revenge plot.

19:01.846 --> 19:04.248
Got bit by those raccoons,
by the way.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.815
What's the worst place on Earth?

19:05.817 --> 19:06.984
Texas in July?

19:06.986 --> 19:07.951
Worse than Texas.

19:07.953 --> 19:09.620
Bigger than Texas.

19:09.622 --> 19:10.990
Stricter than Texas.

19:11.723 --> 19:12.756
Russia?

19:12.758 --> 19:14.725
That's where vodka gets born.

19:14.727 --> 19:16.626
And elections get stolen.

19:16.628 --> 19:18.228
Who cares
when you're the winner!

19:18.230 --> 19:21.198
“An all-expense-paid,
first class ticket to Moscow.”

19:21.200 --> 19:22.732
This smells like a scam.

19:22.734 --> 19:25.035
Don't look a gift whore
in the mouth,

19:25.037 --> 19:28.338
because she probably has
jacked-up teeth.

19:28.340 --> 19:31.174
I mean, how did I win a contest
that I didn't even enter?

19:31.176 --> 19:32.843
Because you didn't win.

19:32.845 --> 19:35.679
Look...
Bianca won.

19:35.681 --> 19:38.114
“We're pleased to honor
the Teacher of the Year,

19:38.116 --> 19:39.150
Bianca del Rio,

19:39.152 --> 19:42.119
at the annual Alchemy and
Manufactory Exposition

19:42.121 --> 19:46.155
and present her with
a cash prize of $100,000

19:46.157 --> 19:49.258
paid in real American money.”

19:49.260 --> 19:51.061
Seems legit.

19:51.063 --> 19:53.266
I guess this means
Bianca's coming back.

19:56.102 --> 19:57.234
Crunch!

19:57.236 --> 19:58.802
I was watchin'
that show you like,

19:58.804 --> 20:00.638
and they were talkin' about
how they throw gays

20:00.640 --> 20:02.405
off buildings in Saudi Arabia.

20:02.407 --> 20:05.909
And I'm thinkin', “How do I get
Bianca del Rio to Riyadh?”

20:05.911 --> 20:08.178
You can't throw someone
off a building, Mama.

20:08.180 --> 20:11.081
I know. I mean they
barely let you drive there.

20:11.083 --> 20:12.382
So then I'm thinkin', okay,

20:12.384 --> 20:14.284
what's the next best
worst place there is.

20:14.286 --> 20:15.251
Russia!

20:15.253 --> 20:17.321
Well, why would
Bianca del Rio go to Russia?

20:17.323 --> 20:20.690
Easy. I sent her a letter sayin'
she won this teachin' award,

20:20.692 --> 20:22.860
only she has to go
to Russia to get it.

20:22.862 --> 20:25.962
Knowin' her, that's an offer
her ego can't refuse.

20:25.964 --> 20:27.296
And once they get
a good look at her,

20:27.298 --> 20:29.333
they'll know she's a queer-bait
drag-queen freak

20:29.335 --> 20:30.366
and lock her up.

20:30.368 --> 20:32.638
Right, so pack those fun bags!

20:33.939 --> 20:34.841
We're goin' to Russia!

20:35.273 --> 20:37.106
I can't just fly to Russia.

20:37.108 --> 20:38.441
It's the middle
of the school year.

20:39.778 --> 20:41.045
How drunk are you?

20:41.047 --> 20:42.912
I'm completely sober.

20:42.914 --> 20:44.984
This is my one hour chip.

20:47.353 --> 20:48.352
I'm full.

20:48.354 --> 20:49.420
And you can't go either.

20:49.422 --> 20:51.689
You said that you just
got that job off your app.

20:51.691 --> 20:54.290
I did!
Last night in the park.

20:54.292 --> 20:55.926
I know you think
I don't work hard,

20:55.928 --> 20:58.261
but I'll work two jobs
at once if I have to,

20:58.263 --> 21:00.698
or if one of them is really hot.

21:00.700 --> 21:02.732
Remember when I told you
that when you talk

21:02.734 --> 21:04.267
it makes people sad?

21:04.269 --> 21:05.936
What have you got to lose?

21:05.938 --> 21:07.336
Call the number on the letter.

21:07.338 --> 21:10.039
If it's legit,
free trip to Russia -

21:10.041 --> 21:11.944
and all that money!

21:13.011 --> 21:16.479
Well, the expo is
during spring break,

21:16.481 --> 21:18.347
and $100,000
is a lot of money.

21:18.349 --> 21:21.852
And as much as I hate
to admit it, Stephen was right.

21:21.854 --> 21:24.153
There's absolutely nothing
keeping me here in Texas.

21:24.155 --> 21:25.424
Less than nothing.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.357
Okay, fine.

21:28.359 --> 21:30.427
Dasvidaniya, Texas!

21:30.429 --> 21:32.462
Bianca del Rio's
goin' to Russia!

21:34.799 --> 21:37.034
I can't wait
to see Bianca in action.

21:37.036 --> 21:39.001
No, no, no.
You're not coming with me.

21:39.003 --> 21:41.805
I'm sure there's some long-term
kennel I can put you in.

21:41.807 --> 21:43.006
You owe me.

21:43.008 --> 21:46.142
You left New York, and I
didn't even get to say goodbye.

21:46.144 --> 21:49.179
Bitch, you were in the ICU.

21:49.181 --> 21:51.981
Oh, yeah.
That was a fun party.

21:51.983 --> 21:56.987
Well, if I can't go to Russia,
I guess I'll just stay here,

21:56.989 --> 21:58.758
unattended.

21:59.023 --> 22:02.191
Hey, you don't need your
cleaning deposit back, do you?

22:02.193 --> 22:05.062
Okay. Put it down.
Fine, fine, fine.

22:05.064 --> 22:08.832
Bianca and Rex
are going to Russia.

22:11.804 --> 22:13.036
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

22:13.038 --> 22:15.372
And listen.
We are going as friends.

22:15.374 --> 22:17.106
Don't get handsy,
‘cause if you do,

22:17.108 --> 22:18.342
I'm gonna throw you
in the dumpster,

22:18.344 --> 22:20.844
like the one you were
born in on prom night.

22:20.846 --> 22:24.948
I- I-I just need to check in
with the CDC before I go.

22:24.950 --> 22:26.885
They always like to know
where I am.

22:29.855 --> 22:33.055
And now I have to
take a Silkwood Shower.

22:33.057 --> 22:34.326
It's gross.

22:36.461 --> 22:38.528
So how does
sending Bianca to Russia

22:38.530 --> 22:40.898
get us out of debt
and me in a bigger bra?

22:40.900 --> 22:42.298
First, we go to Russia.

22:42.300 --> 22:45.401
Then, we watch the Minister of
Homosexual Propaganda

22:45.403 --> 22:47.504
put Bianca in jail forever.

22:47.506 --> 22:51.141
Next, we get your boobs fixed
dirt cheap in Moscow.

22:51.143 --> 22:53.242
That whole country's like
one giant Dollar Store.

22:53.244 --> 22:55.144
Then, with Bianca
out of the picture,

22:55.146 --> 22:57.180
I'd get my old job back
at the school.

22:57.182 --> 22:59.850
I mean it's lose, win-win-win.

22:59.852 --> 23:02.018
Wait. If we can't even
afford a recliner,

23:02.020 --> 23:03.921
how are we gonna afford
to get to Russia?

23:03.923 --> 23:07.224
Well, I may have had myself
declared legally dead

23:07.226 --> 23:08.825
and collected
the insurance money

23:08.827 --> 23:11.094
by pretendin' to be
my imaginary twin sister.

23:11.096 --> 23:13.430
But we'll sort all that out
when we get back...

23:13.432 --> 23:14.498
from Russia!

23:14.500 --> 23:15.902
Woo-hoo!

23:17.169 --> 23:19.536
<i>Do you have any more wig glue?
I'm out.</i>

23:19.538 --> 23:21.470
I told you
not to huff that stuff.

23:21.472 --> 23:24.240
You barely have
a two-digit IQ as it is.

23:24.242 --> 23:26.879
<i>I use it for
legitimate purposes.</i>

23:30.481 --> 23:33.115
I've been downloading a lot
of apps on my phone -

23:33.117 --> 23:37.120
translators, local restaurant
guides, both hookup apps.

23:37.122 --> 23:40.123
Apparently there's a lot
of bears in Russia

23:40.125 --> 23:41.394
that are lesbians.

23:44.395 --> 23:46.563
Where do you think
you're going dressed like that?

23:46.565 --> 23:47.631
Moscow!

23:47.633 --> 23:50.334
How are you gonna
get through airport security?

23:50.336 --> 23:53.237
Okay, I'll change, but I don't
want to miss our 9:00 flight.

23:53.239 --> 23:56.405
Yeah, 9... 9 PM!
At night!

23:56.407 --> 23:58.107
On Saturday!

23:58.109 --> 24:00.009
It's Wednesday, you dink.

24:00.011 --> 24:01.178
Here.

24:01.180 --> 24:03.180
Now listen. I've got two more
days at the high school

24:03.182 --> 24:04.381
before we're outta here.

24:04.383 --> 24:06.952
Do not swallow a jar-full
of pennies while I'm gone.

24:10.655 --> 24:12.457
That only happened once.

24:20.432 --> 24:23.600
Mama, why does Bianca
get to fly first class to Russia

24:23.602 --> 24:26.335
and we're stuck hidin'
in this shipping container?

24:26.337 --> 24:28.404
I had to be sure
Bianca took the bait.

24:28.406 --> 24:30.574
Also, now that
I'm legally dead,

24:30.576 --> 24:32.478
I technically don't have
a passport anymore.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.080
Why's your bag movin'?

24:37.082 --> 24:39.382
Oh, I brought one of
the raccoons along

24:39.384 --> 24:40.616
in case we need it.

24:40.618 --> 24:42.184
Or if we get hungry...

24:42.186 --> 24:43.589
It's gonna be a long trip.

24:44.522 --> 24:46.326
- Old Spice?
- No.

24:49.595 --> 24:50.559
Woo!

24:50.561 --> 24:51.527
Ah!

25:16.321 --> 25:18.421
I'm convinced that
the movie “Psycho”

25:18.423 --> 25:20.257
was filmed in that bathroom.

25:20.259 --> 25:21.490
Twinsies!

25:21.492 --> 25:23.192
Oh, thank God.

25:23.194 --> 25:25.027
The only thing that would
make this room worse

25:25.029 --> 25:27.029
is havin' to
share a bed with you.

25:27.031 --> 25:28.332
You should be so lucky.

25:28.334 --> 25:30.600
You know this place
is really, really gross.

25:30.602 --> 25:33.003
It makes Motel 6 look high-end.

25:33.005 --> 25:35.538
No wonder Tolstoy
was so depressing.

25:35.540 --> 25:36.739
Right?

25:36.741 --> 25:38.607
Remember in Tolstoy Three
when they were

25:38.609 --> 25:40.710
all holding hands
in the furnace?

25:40.712 --> 25:44.113
I didn't know a cartoon
could wreck my shit like that.

25:44.115 --> 25:46.283
You should talk less
and maybe read more.

25:46.285 --> 25:50.187
At least the room comes with
a complimentary bottle of vodka.

25:50.189 --> 25:52.255
Yeah, well, we could
use that as disinfectant.

25:52.257 --> 25:54.560
I can see Alaska from my room!

25:56.161 --> 25:57.361
I don't think so.

25:57.363 --> 25:59.164
Hiiiii-eeeeee!

26:08.106 --> 26:10.407
Yeah, well luckily, we're not
gonna have to be here long,

26:10.409 --> 26:12.074
just a few days.

26:12.076 --> 26:14.247
Well, we got to soak up
some local color.

26:17.148 --> 26:18.481
Oh, God.

26:18.483 --> 26:22.419
I want to go down to the Expo
and let them know that I'm here.

26:22.421 --> 26:25.055
“House Hunters”!
I love this show.

26:25.057 --> 26:26.789
<i>I like house number one.</i>

26:26.791 --> 26:30.059
The open-concept kitchen
had good flow between

26:30.061 --> 26:33.630
the living room and bedroom
because no interior walls.

26:33.632 --> 26:37.299
But we'd have to draw water
from the well out back

26:37.301 --> 26:39.036
since it didn't have
indoor plumbing.

26:39.038 --> 26:40.270
Neither did house number three.

26:40.272 --> 26:44.106
The crumbling living room walls
let in a lot of natural light,

26:44.108 --> 26:47.544
which we need because someone
stripped the copper wiring.

26:47.546 --> 26:50.046
Th-that desperate hovel
was great,

26:50.048 --> 26:53.350
but I-I-I don't like a wall
with so many nails in it.

26:53.352 --> 26:54.750
We aren't royalty.

26:54.752 --> 26:57.586
I liked house number two.
It's in our price range.

26:57.588 --> 26:59.555
But on the small side

26:59.557 --> 27:02.058
and a little too close
to Chernobyl.

27:02.060 --> 27:06.430
Yes, but the interior walls and
the updated bathroom sold me.

27:06.432 --> 27:08.000
I think house number two.

27:08.267 --> 27:11.434
Our nice, young heterosexual
couple chose correctly.

27:11.436 --> 27:13.636
The second house
with its modern décor,

27:13.638 --> 27:15.705
functioning appliances

27:15.707 --> 27:19.442
and a tasteful use
of rich colors,

27:19.444 --> 27:23.182
obviously the work of a deviant
homosexual who must be punished!

27:23.781 --> 27:25.248
"House Hunters"
has gone downhill

27:25.250 --> 27:27.116
since they got rid of
Suzanne Whang.

27:27.118 --> 27:29.786
That's not “House Hunters.”
That's “Homo Hunters.”

27:29.788 --> 27:32.221
And look!
It's that Svetlana -

27:32.223 --> 27:33.489
that Russian bitch.

27:33.491 --> 27:36.093
She's the Minister of
Homosexual Propaganda.

27:36.095 --> 27:38.260
She's the one that
puts all the gays in prison.

27:38.262 --> 27:39.863
For making her wear that jacket?

27:39.865 --> 27:42.164
No, asshole, for being gay!

27:42.166 --> 27:44.133
Russia has very strict laws,

27:44.135 --> 27:48.138
which is why it's very important
for you to be inconspicuous.

27:48.140 --> 27:49.439
Do you know
what that word means?

27:49.441 --> 27:51.540
Inconspicuous is my middle name.

27:51.542 --> 27:53.211
I have mean parents.

27:56.181 --> 27:57.549
Hey, girls!

27:57.849 --> 28:00.150
So much for being inconspicuous!

28:00.152 --> 28:02.751
What? I don't want people
to know we're at a science fair.

28:02.753 --> 28:04.854
All we have to do
is find the coordinator

28:04.856 --> 28:07.257
and let them know that
Bianca will be here tomorrow

28:07.259 --> 28:10.392
to collect the check,
and then we're out of here.

28:10.394 --> 28:13.563
Siri. How do you say
“hot nerd” in Russian?

28:13.565 --> 28:16.298
<i>I am not Siri,
you capitalist pig.</i>

28:16.300 --> 28:17.834
- See.
- Just look around.

28:17.836 --> 28:19.503
You don't need an app for that.

28:19.505 --> 28:22.175
Ugh!
My boredom is zero feet away.

28:36.387 --> 28:39.221
To light bulb,
we cut potato in half.

28:39.223 --> 28:41.324
Find two coins
if you can spare them,

28:41.326 --> 28:43.160
two nails
from house next door,

28:43.162 --> 28:44.928
and a little bit
of copper wire.

28:44.930 --> 28:47.396
Now, copper wire is easy
to fetch from the neighbor,

28:47.398 --> 28:49.865
because once you take the two
nails the house falls down.

28:49.867 --> 28:50.866
He's cute.

28:50.868 --> 28:52.936
When we get back to the hotel,
remind me to go

28:52.938 --> 28:55.604
down to the basement
and find your standards.

28:55.606 --> 28:57.474
Standards? Coming from you?

28:57.476 --> 28:59.508
You're the one that found
the sex offender registry

28:59.510 --> 29:01.411
and thought it was
a dating site.

29:01.413 --> 29:03.580
Add all these materials
together to the potato

29:03.582 --> 29:05.485
and we are making electricity.

29:06.250 --> 29:07.452
Any questions?

29:07.885 --> 29:09.219
Da.

29:09.221 --> 29:10.853
When do we eat potato?

29:10.855 --> 29:12.189
Oh.

29:12.191 --> 29:15.324
How many share
in one-half potato?

29:15.326 --> 29:16.793
Whole family?

29:16.795 --> 29:20.396
Potatoes for making electricity.
Not for eating.

29:26.837 --> 29:29.372
Hi. I-I'm Richard Martinez,

29:29.374 --> 29:32.241
and I'm a science teacher
from America and...

29:32.243 --> 29:33.977
...and this is my friend Rex,

29:33.979 --> 29:36.680
and we've come here
for the, uh, science expo.

29:36.682 --> 29:38.815
Hi.
Mitya.

29:38.817 --> 29:40.283
Short for Dmitriy.

29:40.285 --> 29:42.686
Mitya, nice to meet ya'.

29:45.656 --> 29:46.890
Oh, look!

29:46.892 --> 29:48.894
Anything else.

29:55.366 --> 29:56.799
We can get lunch soon, Mama.

29:56.801 --> 29:58.267
That raccoon
wasn't very filling.

29:58.269 --> 30:00.237
Yeah, yeah.
I just got to find Bianca

30:00.239 --> 30:02.572
and then get the police
to rush in here and arrest her.

30:02.574 --> 30:04.911
It will be glorious!

30:06.510 --> 30:09.511
Why did the Russian hooker
pee on the mattress?

30:09.513 --> 30:11.783
‘Cause she thought
it was you, Deborah!

30:12.951 --> 30:14.653
Fake news!

30:19.758 --> 30:22.025
Hasta la pavement, bitch!

30:22.027 --> 30:24.393
Debbieeee!!!!

30:31.036 --> 30:32.835
She's dressed as Richard?!

30:32.837 --> 30:34.770
How am I gonna
get the police to arrest her

30:34.772 --> 30:36.538
if she's just a
run-of-the-mill gay burger

30:36.540 --> 30:38.874
without the flame sauce
and extra cheese?

30:38.876 --> 30:41.577
Mmm, cheese...
You're makin' me hungry.

30:41.579 --> 30:43.046
Come on.
Let's go back to the hotel.

30:43.048 --> 30:44.249
I know how to
get rid of her there.

30:45.683 --> 30:48.584
America is a long way to come
just for a little Alchemy Expo.

30:48.586 --> 30:49.553
Well, I'm...

30:49.555 --> 30:52.455
I mean, a friend of mine
is getting a prize.

30:52.457 --> 30:55.691
So I only came here tonight to,
uh, meet up with the organizer.

30:55.693 --> 30:58.862
Ah, Sacha is gone already,
but will be back tomorrow.

30:58.864 --> 31:01.398
Will, um, you be here tomorrow?

31:01.400 --> 31:02.399
Yes.

31:02.401 --> 31:03.767
I see you then?

31:03.769 --> 31:04.801
Sure.

31:04.803 --> 31:05.972
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:07.638 --> 31:08.305
See you then.

31:08.307 --> 31:09.338
- Da.
- Mm-hmm.

31:09.340 --> 31:10.606
- Ya.
- See you then.

31:10.608 --> 31:11.509
Bye-bye.

31:18.517 --> 31:19.818
Ahhh!

31:23.989 --> 31:25.455
Bye-bye...

31:25.457 --> 31:26.692
Please don't die.

31:26.958 --> 31:29.892
All I'm sayin' is
keep it in your panties.

31:29.894 --> 31:32.094
Russia's already dangerous
enough for the both of us

31:32.096 --> 31:34.530
without you making
a spectacle of yourself.

31:34.532 --> 31:35.699
Oh, don't come for me.

31:35.701 --> 31:37.600
I saw you over there with
the queen of the nerd herd.

31:37.602 --> 31:39.401
God, your meet cute
was so pathetic,

31:39.403 --> 31:41.904
if I still had the gag reflex
I'd barf.

31:41.906 --> 31:44.540
Mitya was the only interesting
person at that place.

31:44.542 --> 31:46.042
And really,
is that what they call

31:46.044 --> 31:47.544
a science fair here in Russia?

31:47.546 --> 31:49.645
Pretty flimsy for a country
that hacked elections.

31:49.647 --> 31:51.014
Exactly! Which doesn't explain

31:51.016 --> 31:52.782
how they could afford
those plane tickets

31:52.784 --> 31:54.950
<i>and</i> the $100,000 prize.

31:54.952 --> 31:56.986
You always overthink everything.

31:56.988 --> 31:58.020
You know what...

31:58.022 --> 31:59.788
You always
under-think everything.

31:59.790 --> 32:01.824
You see?
You see what you did there?

32:01.826 --> 32:04.661
You and Stephen always say
that we're friends,

32:04.663 --> 32:08.064
but you talk about me like I'm
your nephew with Alzheimer's.

32:08.066 --> 32:11.133
<i>All I'm saying is that
you should trust me more.</i>

32:11.135 --> 32:12.669
Why don't you just relax

32:12.671 --> 32:15.537
and enjoy all that Russia
has to offer?

32:15.539 --> 32:18.574
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Relax. Enjoy...

32:18.576 --> 32:19.778
Oh!!!

32:22.446 --> 32:23.546
Is this your room?

32:23.548 --> 32:24.849
Uh, ye-yeah.

32:25.584 --> 32:28.054
What seems to be
the trouble, officer?

32:29.453 --> 32:30.519
Whose suitcase is this?

32:30.521 --> 32:32.455
- Oh...
- Bianca.

32:32.457 --> 32:35.892
Is Bianca flaming drag queen
or degenerate homosexual?

32:35.894 --> 32:37.126
Yes.

32:37.128 --> 32:40.863
Actually, Bianca was gonna take,
uh, these clothes and... wigs

32:40.865 --> 32:44.500
to her mother's to cheer her up
because, uh, she's really sick.

32:44.502 --> 32:45.535
Cancer.

32:47.038 --> 32:48.039
Hmm!

32:48.940 --> 32:49.972
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey.

32:49.974 --> 32:52.409
I- I-I ju-had, just...

32:52.411 --> 32:54.980
Oh, great. Great.

32:58.517 --> 33:01.049
So far, your plan of relaxing
and waiting to see

33:01.051 --> 33:03.819
what Russia has in store for us
really worked out great.

33:03.821 --> 33:05.721
Didn't it?
Now what are we gonna do?

33:05.723 --> 33:08.490
Now that the police have
confiscated all of our drag!

33:08.492 --> 33:09.793
I went through your bag.

33:09.795 --> 33:11.827
Most of it was from
an outlet mall anyway.

33:11.829 --> 33:13.162
There was 50 cents in my purse.

33:13.164 --> 33:14.963
We'll replace the rest
when we go home.

33:14.965 --> 33:17.866
They're expecting Bianca del Rio
tomorrow at the expo.

33:17.868 --> 33:21.004
But how is Bianca gonna go there
and collect $100,000 check

33:21.006 --> 33:23.773
when Bianca's being
hauled away in a bag?!

33:23.775 --> 33:26.742
You can use my outfit.
You can have my wig.

33:26.744 --> 33:30.447
We'll let this dress out
in the back... A lot.

33:30.449 --> 33:32.015
And nobody will know any better.

33:32.017 --> 33:34.017
Well, that's not gonna work
because they've probably already

33:34.019 --> 33:35.884
seen pictures of me
on the internet.

33:35.886 --> 33:38.654
Internet?!
They barely have electricity.

33:38.656 --> 33:41.090
You've seen your boyfriend
and his potato.

33:41.092 --> 33:42.491
It's pathetic.

33:42.493 --> 33:44.727
Bianca has brown hair,
and that dress of yours

33:44.729 --> 33:46.462
is a walking
bacterial test strip!

33:46.464 --> 33:48.096
What we need to do
is find somebody

33:48.098 --> 33:49.966
in this country that has drag.

33:49.968 --> 33:51.801
We can create a new Bianca.

33:51.803 --> 33:54.671
I can go in, collect the check,
and get the hell out of here!

33:54.673 --> 33:56.738
Because the longer we stay here,
the bigger chance we have

33:56.740 --> 34:00.176
of somebody giving us a one-way
ticket to a Siberian hell hole!

34:00.178 --> 34:01.643
You're so dramatic.

34:01.645 --> 34:04.080
Fine. I'll ask some guys
on this app

34:04.082 --> 34:06.048
if there is a gay bar
around here.

34:06.050 --> 34:08.016
I'm sure there's
a tragic drag show.

34:08.018 --> 34:09.016
There always is.

34:09.018 --> 34:11.521
We'll steal some looks,
collect that check,

34:11.523 --> 34:13.525
and head back to Texas.

34:14.092 --> 34:15.025
What do you know!

34:15.027 --> 34:17.726
I guess I do have
some gag reflex left.

34:17.728 --> 34:20.597
I'm full of surprises.

34:20.599 --> 34:22.568
Gross.

34:26.538 --> 34:28.838
Mama, you'll never guess
what I got.

34:28.840 --> 34:31.840
Stop scratchin'
or it won't heal right.

34:31.842 --> 34:34.744
It's not gonna heal right
until that doctor fixes me.

34:34.746 --> 34:37.612
<i>We've been in Moscow two hours
and Bianca isn't in jail yet.</i>

34:37.614 --> 34:39.516
What kind of country is this?

34:39.518 --> 34:40.849
We called the police
and reported

34:40.851 --> 34:43.150
a room-full of flaming
drag queens and homosexuals.

34:43.152 --> 34:44.920
<i>What more can we do?</i>

34:44.922 --> 34:47.989
Can we please get some
lunch and find that doctor?

34:47.992 --> 34:49.226
We'll get some food on the way.

34:49.228 --> 34:52.527
Those queer burgers found
a gay bar they're goin' to.

34:52.530 --> 34:53.829
This could be our big break.

34:53.831 --> 34:55.898
Mm... Burgers.

34:55.900 --> 34:57.099
<i>But first...</i>

34:57.101 --> 34:59.170
we'll need a disguise.

35:03.708 --> 35:04.874
Where are we?

35:04.876 --> 35:06.543
I don't know.
We're in Russia.

35:06.545 --> 35:08.677
It smells like desperation.

35:08.679 --> 35:10.114
We must be close.

35:16.922 --> 35:17.923
<i>Da?</i>

35:20.157 --> 35:21.659
<i>Glasnost!</i>

35:23.862 --> 35:30.869

35:41.846 --> 35:43.211
Welcome to Club Katya.

35:43.213 --> 35:45.981
I am your hostess, Katya.

35:45.983 --> 35:46.950
Hello, Katya.

35:46.952 --> 35:49.751
This is my friend Rex,
and my name is Richard.

35:49.753 --> 35:51.653
Ah, yes.
Nice to meet ya!

35:51.655 --> 35:52.387
Oh.

35:52.389 --> 35:53.789
Mwah.

35:53.791 --> 35:54.958
Hmm.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.892
Uh, I was wondering, Katya,
if you could help us out.

35:56.894 --> 35:58.927
I'm looking for some drag.

35:58.929 --> 35:59.829
Oh, perfect.

35:59.831 --> 36:01.097
This is Gorky Park.

36:01.099 --> 36:03.231
She is one of our
very best drag.

36:03.233 --> 36:06.702
Huge, enormous talent!
And that is no fat joke.

36:06.704 --> 36:10.873
<i>♪ She's an uncover girl... ♪</i>

36:10.875 --> 36:14.142

36:21.853 --> 36:23.789
<i>♪ She's an undercover girl ♪</i>

36:24.188 --> 36:26.088
I'm actually looking
for some drag, as-

36:26.090 --> 36:28.090
as in clothing,
for myself.

36:28.092 --> 36:29.057
Huh?

36:29.059 --> 36:31.226
It's a really long story.

36:31.228 --> 36:33.329
Well, long story
made bearable by vodka.

36:33.331 --> 36:34.333
Come this way.

36:38.036 --> 36:42.005
What kind of a plastic surgeon
has an office in an alley?

36:42.007 --> 36:44.007
This is not as comfortable
as I thought.

36:44.009 --> 36:46.242
Focus up.
Bianca del Rio's in there.

36:46.244 --> 36:47.409
I need you to go in there

36:47.411 --> 36:49.679
and come back out
with a full report.

36:49.681 --> 36:52.851
If we're lucky, police will
round up the whole fruit basket.

36:55.320 --> 36:58.354
When I have a student,
they get class and sass.

36:58.356 --> 37:02.258
When Deborah has a student,
they get wrinkly old ass.

37:03.695 --> 37:04.863
Class dismissed!

37:06.764 --> 37:09.067
Deb!

37:11.101 --> 37:12.200
Now go! Go!

37:12.202 --> 37:13.369
But, Mama...

37:13.371 --> 37:15.237
Oh, and watch out
for that eye hole.

37:15.239 --> 37:17.373
They say they're not interested
in your lady business.

37:17.375 --> 37:19.909
With these foreign perverts,
you never know.

37:19.911 --> 37:20.913
Go.

37:21.813 --> 37:22.845
<i>You got this.</i>

37:41.900 --> 37:42.999
<i>So let me understand...</i>

37:43.001 --> 37:46.034
You are found out to be
gay teacher and then fired.

37:46.036 --> 37:47.135
Uh, yeah.

37:47.137 --> 37:48.737
Okay, and then sent to prison?

37:48.739 --> 37:49.938
No, no, no.

37:49.940 --> 37:52.307
I actually went back to school
in drag as Bianca del Rio.

37:52.309 --> 37:54.142
Oh. So you are
found out in drag

37:54.144 --> 37:55.311
and then sent to prison?

37:55.313 --> 37:56.878
No, no.
I'm still teaching there.

37:56.880 --> 37:59.115
The person that fired me
is the one who's in jail.

37:59.117 --> 38:01.217
This Texas, it must
be magical place.

38:01.219 --> 38:02.452
What's the winter like?

38:02.454 --> 38:04.019
Bitter and haunting?

38:04.021 --> 38:06.988
Uh, no, not haunting.
It's just pretty average.

38:06.990 --> 38:11.429
Oh! Let us drink to Texas,
the magical kingdom of paradise.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.766
You know, I never
thought about it that way,

38:17.768 --> 38:19.135
but Texas doesn't even
sound that bad

38:19.137 --> 38:20.836
compared to Russia after all.

38:20.838 --> 38:22.104
Ugh.

38:22.106 --> 38:23.340
When I think of the sad times
here in Russia, I say to myself,

38:23.342 --> 38:26.242
“Katya. At least you're not
living in Saudi Arabia.”

38:26.244 --> 38:27.844
They have
the killings, of course,

38:27.846 --> 38:29.211
but think of desert drag.

38:29.213 --> 38:30.479
Sand up your tuck?

38:30.481 --> 38:31.947
It's disgusting.

38:31.949 --> 38:33.349
Well, look at the bright side.

38:33.351 --> 38:35.016
You could probably make a pearl.

38:35.018 --> 38:36.385
I could have pearl necklace?

38:37.822 --> 38:40.155
You know, I'm-I'm-
I'm just curious.

38:40.157 --> 38:41.891
It's like, why are
all these posters up

38:41.893 --> 38:43.825
of this Svetlana bitch?

38:43.827 --> 38:45.927
Uck! The queens here
are obsessed with her.

38:45.929 --> 38:48.197
But isn't she the one
who hates all the gays?

38:48.199 --> 38:49.499
Yes, but not always so.

38:49.501 --> 38:52.802
She was at one time Moscow's
biggest, how you say like, um,

38:52.804 --> 38:54.103
stick witch.

38:54.105 --> 38:55.371
- Fag hag?
- <i>Da!</i>

38:55.373 --> 38:56.805
It was the classic tale.

38:56.807 --> 38:57.940
Woman love gays.

38:57.942 --> 38:59.008
Gays love woman.

38:59.010 --> 39:00.309
Woman turns her hair red.

39:00.311 --> 39:01.911
Gays talk shit at brunch.

39:01.913 --> 39:04.246
Woman becomes Minister
of Homosexual Propaganda,

39:04.248 --> 39:07.182
sends all her gay friends
to the Siberian work camp.

39:07.184 --> 39:09.217
Woo! That must have
been some brunch.

39:09.219 --> 39:10.920
No, it was an awful brunch.

39:10.922 --> 39:12.521
One egg and piece of toast
for a party of twelve.

39:12.523 --> 39:14.792
There is nothing worse
than a hungry queen.

39:15.860 --> 39:17.126
Gorky Park was one of them.

39:17.128 --> 39:18.961
She was the only survivor.

39:18.963 --> 39:20.896
<i>What happened to everyone else?</i>

39:20.898 --> 39:21.963
She ate them.

39:21.965 --> 39:22.965
Look at that fat fucking bitch.

39:22.967 --> 39:25.034
How else would you
survive winter in Siberia?

39:25.036 --> 39:27.804
Anyways, I'm sorry
I become emotional.

39:27.806 --> 39:29.204
Let me ask you.

39:29.206 --> 39:31.941
Who is this weird guy
you are hanging out with?

39:31.943 --> 39:33.208
He is boyfriend?

39:33.210 --> 39:34.242
Boyfriend?

39:34.244 --> 39:35.378
Oh, with Rex?

39:35.380 --> 39:37.146
Oh, God,
that's not my boyfriend.

39:37.148 --> 39:38.347
He's somewhere around here.

39:38.349 --> 39:40.048
He was whistling
at some guy earlier.

39:40.050 --> 39:41.818
Oh, that's him right
there by the bathroom.

39:41.820 --> 39:44.519
I don't suck dick,
but I'll put it in my mouth

39:44.521 --> 39:46.555
till the swelling goes down.

39:48.927 --> 39:50.258
I arrest you.

39:50.260 --> 39:52.063
Oh yes, daddy!

39:52.597 --> 39:53.896
Oh!...

39:53.898 --> 39:56.132
Oh, wait.
You're serious.

39:56.134 --> 39:57.400
You, too, tranny.

39:57.402 --> 39:59.501
Get your hands off of me.

39:59.503 --> 40:01.539
Oh, no!
Secret police!

40:02.172 --> 40:03.338
I'm not one of them!

40:03.340 --> 40:04.342
Hold that thought.

40:07.244 --> 40:09.211
Oh, no!
The paddy wagon!

40:12.150 --> 40:13.050
Nyet!

40:16.119 --> 40:17.286
Weeee!

40:17.288 --> 40:19.224
Wait! Wait!

40:20.358 --> 40:21.527
You!

40:42.547 --> 40:44.280
This whole trip -

40:44.282 --> 40:46.382
I should have known
you were behind it!

40:46.384 --> 40:48.119
Eat trash, sissy pants!

40:49.019 --> 40:50.389
Aw, fuck!

40:58.161 --> 40:59.263
Ahhh! Hey!

41:18.983 --> 41:20.318
Son of a bitch!

41:28.159 --> 41:29.327
Mama!

41:32.030 --> 41:33.131
<i>Mama!</i>

41:50.481 --> 41:52.280
So-so what'd you do

41:52.282 --> 41:54.282
to get out of jail, Deborah?

41:54.284 --> 41:56.284
Did ya have sex with the warden?

41:56.286 --> 41:57.954
I know that he's your uncle.

41:57.956 --> 42:00.456
Oh, save your insults,
Bianca del Richard,

42:00.458 --> 42:02.557
‘cause now I'm the one
holdin' the cat

42:02.559 --> 42:04.929
and you're the one
fuckin' his legs.

42:05.563 --> 42:06.662
Wait. Hold on.

42:06.664 --> 42:08.463
How tight
are your Spanx, Deborah?

42:08.465 --> 42:10.599
Is it cuttin' off the
circulation to your brain?

42:10.601 --> 42:12.467
I mean,
what have you done here?

42:12.469 --> 42:13.469
Revenge!

42:13.471 --> 42:16.706
I finally got revenge
on Miss Bianca del Rio!

42:16.708 --> 42:18.474
Really queen, revenge?

42:18.476 --> 42:19.541
I'm the one standing here

42:19.543 --> 42:21.577
and your daughter's being
hauled away to jail.

42:21.579 --> 42:24.079
Yeah, technically that wasn't
part of the plan.

42:24.081 --> 42:25.715
Yeah, and...
now we've lost them.

42:25.717 --> 42:28.450
Well, I got you!

42:28.452 --> 42:29.985
Wait, hold up.

42:29.987 --> 42:31.987
I don't know the way
back to the hotel.

42:31.989 --> 42:33.255
<i>Wait for me.</i>

42:58.048 --> 43:00.583
Do you have any idea
how dangerous Russia is?

43:00.585 --> 43:02.650
We should not have
come here in the first place.

43:02.652 --> 43:05.054
No! You never
shoulda come to Texas.

43:05.056 --> 43:06.755
You brought this on
yourself, gay boy.

43:06.757 --> 43:08.523
All I wanted to do was teach.

43:08.525 --> 43:10.159
You were the one
who shoulda been

43:10.161 --> 43:11.159
minding your own
fucking business.

43:11.161 --> 43:13.095
You queers shouldn't
be around children.

43:13.097 --> 43:14.396
Funny coming from you.

43:14.398 --> 43:16.197
Aren't you the one who
got caught having sex

43:16.199 --> 43:18.434
with a high school student,
Miss First?!

43:18.436 --> 43:21.070
He looked legal -
from the waist down.

43:21.072 --> 43:22.271
You're just jealous.

43:22.273 --> 43:25.106
The only person endangering
a child around here is you.

43:25.108 --> 43:27.242
Where's your daughter Carly?
In jail?

43:27.244 --> 43:29.110
She knew there
might be sacrifices.

43:29.112 --> 43:30.646
Besides, it was worth it

43:30.648 --> 43:32.815
seein' that hooker friend
of yours locked up.

43:32.817 --> 43:34.583
She prefers whore.

43:34.585 --> 43:36.786
Oh yeah?
Well, you're next, flame sauce.

43:36.788 --> 43:38.456
You better watch yourself.

43:39.724 --> 43:41.123
Where are you going?

43:41.125 --> 43:43.592
Oh, I got the room next door.

43:43.594 --> 43:45.496
Got a special rate.

43:56.740 --> 43:58.309
This bitch.

44:00.110 --> 44:01.510
Perfect timing.

44:01.512 --> 44:03.211
<i>Sorry to interrupt nothing.</i>

44:03.213 --> 44:04.713
<i>Rex wasn't answering his phone.</i>

44:04.715 --> 44:05.847
<i>Where is he?</i>

44:05.849 --> 44:07.450
<i>Another Netflix and chill?</i>

44:07.452 --> 44:08.550
<i>Hulu and hump?</i>

44:08.552 --> 44:09.684
<i>Amazon and anal?</i>

44:09.686 --> 44:12.153
We're in Russia.
Rex is in a Gulag.

44:12.155 --> 44:14.123
<i>Come on, girl.
Who's Gulag?</i>

44:14.125 --> 44:15.791
It's a Russian prison.

44:15.793 --> 44:17.827
They've taken Rex,
they've taken my Bianca drag,

44:17.829 --> 44:20.829
and I'm in some
hideous hotel with Deborah.

44:20.831 --> 44:22.764
She set me up, again.

44:22.766 --> 44:25.101
Well, I guess now is
not the best time to tell you

44:25.103 --> 44:27.635
that I'm not really
on a cruise ship, girl.

44:27.637 --> 44:30.305
I'm a contestant on
“RuPaul's Drag Race.”

44:31.309 --> 44:32.374
<i>Well, if you're calling already</i>

44:32.376 --> 44:34.577
<i>I guess we're both
not getting $100,000.</i>

44:34.579 --> 44:36.711
Sister, how dare you say that!

44:36.713 --> 44:38.646
Do you know what I've been
goin' through over here, girl?

44:38.648 --> 44:40.115
Save it,
Martin Luther Queen.

44:40.117 --> 44:41.550
I'm in a jam here.

44:41.552 --> 44:43.452
I've got to find a way
to get Rex out of prison

44:43.454 --> 44:45.153
and get us back to America.

44:45.155 --> 44:47.289
And drag alone
ain't gonna fix it.

44:47.291 --> 44:49.891
<i>Bianca del Rio solved
your Deborah problem before.</i>

44:49.893 --> 44:51.459
<i>Now I know she can do it again.</i>

44:51.461 --> 44:53.896
<i>Listen, if drag can fix
a face like yours...</i>

44:53.898 --> 44:56.101
Uh, I'm hanging up now.

44:59.302 --> 45:01.403
- Nice try, Bitch.
- Thanks, girl.

45:01.405 --> 45:03.639
Did you see it, girl?
They pulled a pag. Woo!

45:03.641 --> 45:05.510
It's all right.
There's always All Stars.

45:09.614 --> 45:10.746
Bitch!

45:10.748 --> 45:13.249
You know you're not
supposed to be on your phone.

45:13.251 --> 45:15.751
Listen, I need your help
pullin' together some new looks.

45:15.753 --> 45:17.253
It's an emergency.

45:17.255 --> 45:19.822
That's what I told you
on the runway, fag.

45:19.824 --> 45:21.023
Now get!

45:21.025 --> 45:24.325
Bunny, reach up into that
Moroccan bizarre up on your head

45:24.327 --> 45:27.362
and pull me out a #12
brunette wig now.

45:27.364 --> 45:29.197
Does anyone else around here

45:29.199 --> 45:32.568
hear an irritating screeching
voice that just won't quit!

45:32.570 --> 45:34.405
La-la-la-la-la-la!

45:34.938 --> 45:36.938
We have to help Bianca del Rio.

45:36.940 --> 45:39.708
Oh, the one whose face
looks like a smashed-in piñata?

45:39.710 --> 45:41.443
I cannot believe you
would say something like...

45:41.445 --> 45:42.510
- But!
- Yes, ma'am.

45:42.512 --> 45:44.746
Anything to shut you up.

45:44.748 --> 45:46.815
Just reach into the left,

45:46.817 --> 45:49.684
passed the gerbil cage,
which is open.

45:49.686 --> 45:52.423
Oh! I think I found
Natalee Holloway.

45:59.797 --> 46:02.367
I know that you're following me.

46:03.568 --> 46:06.138
Is not me. Is bowl of borscht!

46:12.610 --> 46:13.775
Fresh meat.

46:13.777 --> 46:16.280
More like day-old bread back.

46:23.286 --> 46:26.354
Someone smells fishy...
Too fishy.

46:26.356 --> 46:27.923
They think I'm one of you.

46:27.925 --> 46:31.860
If by one of you, you mean
a blond slut, then yes.

46:31.862 --> 46:33.095
Yes, ya are.

46:33.097 --> 46:36.599
The guard called me a tranny.
He said I had a meaty tuck.

46:36.601 --> 46:39.601
I know you. You're the girl
from Richard's school.

46:39.603 --> 46:41.970
Your mother's insane and
a snake bit your boobs off.

46:41.972 --> 46:43.671
Did we meet back in Texas?

46:43.673 --> 46:45.273
Oh, no. Stephen made
a picture book

46:45.275 --> 46:46.874
for me to read on the way
so I would know

46:46.876 --> 46:48.010
who all the players are,

46:48.012 --> 46:50.311
and he did not
do you justice, girl.

46:50.313 --> 46:53.282
What are they
gonna do to us in here?

46:53.284 --> 46:55.550
Keep us here forever,
if they want.

46:55.552 --> 46:56.784
That's not fair.

46:56.786 --> 46:58.086
Welcome to my world,

46:58.088 --> 47:01.356
which now that they think you're
one of us is your world, too.

47:01.358 --> 47:02.858
That's how it is.

47:02.860 --> 47:05.793
Fire us, imprison us,
don't text us back -

47:05.795 --> 47:07.463
whatever they want.

47:07.465 --> 47:09.530
I'm sorry. I didn't know
it would be like this.

47:09.532 --> 47:10.532
Oh, you're from Texas.

47:10.534 --> 47:12.470
I'm sure there's a lot
you don't know.

47:15.806 --> 47:17.438
I'm Vickie Leaks.

47:17.440 --> 47:18.941
I run this joint.

47:18.943 --> 47:22.278
What are you in for, fish stick?
That dress?

47:22.280 --> 47:25.380
No, for cutting hog-bodied
queens who wear Jaclyn Smith

47:25.382 --> 47:27.483
and try to start
what they can't finish.

47:27.485 --> 47:31.487
Honey, Rampage is a brand,
not a way of life.

47:31.489 --> 47:35.523
Don't take it out on me because
you aged out of Wet Seal.

47:35.525 --> 47:38.559
I've got a knife up in my wig.
Let's dance, bitch.

47:38.561 --> 47:40.795
Simmer down, Hot Topic!

47:40.797 --> 47:42.600
I'm just taking
your temperature.

47:46.503 --> 47:47.672
Thanks for that.

47:48.438 --> 47:51.340
Do you really have
a knife in your wig?

47:51.342 --> 47:53.309
An emery board and lipstick.

47:54.644 --> 47:56.644
I'm Carly, by the way.

47:56.646 --> 47:58.746
I'm Rex...
And don't worry about her.

47:58.748 --> 48:00.081
She's just testing you.

48:00.083 --> 48:02.483
The first night it's all about
trying to see how tough you are.

48:02.485 --> 48:05.653
Anyone tries to mess with you,
you just mess right back.

48:05.655 --> 48:08.691
Hopefully, my mom will be
here soon to get me out.

48:08.693 --> 48:10.825
The same mother
who tried to use you

48:10.827 --> 48:12.927
to exact her revenge
on someone else?

48:12.929 --> 48:15.463
You're not her accomplice;
you're her victim.

48:15.465 --> 48:16.731
You think so?

48:16.733 --> 48:18.666
I can speak for many a queen
when I say

48:18.668 --> 48:20.501
you cannot let a bad mother

48:20.503 --> 48:22.938
keep in the way
of you being fabulous.

48:22.940 --> 48:25.974
You've got a cute face
and legs, legs, legs.

48:27.010 --> 48:30.012
I've spent my whole life
hatin' homosexuals,

48:30.014 --> 48:31.914
but you're really nice.

48:31.916 --> 48:33.148
Oh, no, girlie.
I'm mean as hell.

48:33.150 --> 48:35.717
You're just seeing me as a
real person for the first time.

48:35.719 --> 48:37.721
That's all we are.
We're all just people.

48:43.360 --> 48:45.396
Except that bitch.
I don't know what she is.

48:53.536 --> 48:55.673
You wanna play Go Fishy?

48:57.440 --> 49:00.008
Did you smuggle that
deck of cards in your wig, too?

49:00.010 --> 49:02.978
The cavity search
wasn't very thorough...

49:02.980 --> 49:04.815
Unfortunately.

49:11.155 --> 49:12.854
I'm no Jessica Fletcher,

49:12.856 --> 49:15.057
but I know
when I'm being followed!

49:15.059 --> 49:17.159
Come on out, Deborah.

49:17.161 --> 49:18.894
How'd you know it was me?

49:18.896 --> 49:20.028
I have eyes.

49:20.030 --> 49:21.496
Yeah, four eyes!

49:23.733 --> 49:26.135
Look, Deborah,
I'm gonna temporarily ignore

49:26.137 --> 49:28.436
your psychotic blend
of down-home homophobia

49:28.438 --> 49:29.771
and lack of southern charm.

49:29.773 --> 49:31.072
Considering we both have

49:31.074 --> 49:32.874
two people that
we care about in prison,

49:32.876 --> 49:35.878
I think it's best that we work
together to get them out.

49:35.880 --> 49:37.146
You would do that?

49:37.148 --> 49:39.548
Yes, I would do that.
And I hate you.

49:39.550 --> 49:41.450
I'm sorry.
Hate is a strong word.

49:41.452 --> 49:44.485
What I meant to say
was I <i>really</i> hate you.

49:44.487 --> 49:45.720
You don't get to hate me!

49:45.722 --> 49:48.023
I get to hate you.
I'm a good person.

49:48.025 --> 49:50.458
I follow the teachin's
of the Bible!

49:50.460 --> 49:54.463
Shh!!! Shut up!
They'll hear you.

49:54.465 --> 49:56.130
What? Are the police
still around?

49:56.132 --> 49:57.132
No, the rats.

49:57.134 --> 49:59.168
Their screech is like
a God damn mating call.

49:59.170 --> 50:00.538
Come. Let's go inside.

50:04.775 --> 50:06.575
I really wish I had on
a horrible dress

50:06.577 --> 50:08.709
so I could talk to you
hag to hag.

50:08.711 --> 50:10.612
I'd call you a
“see you next Tuesday,”

50:10.614 --> 50:13.048
but that would imply I ever
want to see you again.

50:13.050 --> 50:14.115
Just say cunt, Deborah.

50:14.117 --> 50:16.617
We're in Russia.
Nobody knows what it means.

50:16.619 --> 50:17.952
No, we have cunt here.

50:17.954 --> 50:19.822
Is woman.
Woman like her, small.

50:19.824 --> 50:21.826
Not big in hips,
but huge vagina.

50:22.860 --> 50:25.994
Katya, this is Deborah,
the one I was telling you about.

50:25.996 --> 50:28.664
The wicked witch
of the Western Hemisphere!

50:28.666 --> 50:29.632
Oh, fuck you!

50:29.634 --> 50:33.534
I am a good Christian,
just like my president.

50:33.536 --> 50:35.804
And I came to this
Godless nation of yours -

50:35.806 --> 50:37.104
it smells like a burnt cat -

50:37.106 --> 50:38.941
to try to seek justice!

50:38.943 --> 50:41.776
Nyet. You are obviously selfish,
vindictive cunt, but no matter.

50:41.778 --> 50:43.545
Look at this place.
It's destroyed!

50:43.547 --> 50:44.813
They took everything, everyone.

50:44.815 --> 50:49.184
I barely escaped with my life
and just a little bit of money.

50:49.186 --> 50:50.052
You know what!

50:50.054 --> 50:52.019
Rex never turns off
his hookup apps.

50:52.021 --> 50:54.655
He will no doubt be held
under Kremlin in secret prison

50:54.657 --> 50:56.992
operated by the fabulous
Miss Svetlana Zlopasnost.

50:56.994 --> 50:58.594
You think you could
get us inside?

50:58.596 --> 51:00.628
Maybe hack into the mainframe?

51:00.630 --> 51:02.798
I wish, but I've maxed out
on sexual favors

51:02.800 --> 51:04.833
already this fiscal quarter.
Not work.

51:04.835 --> 51:05.900
Then what are we gonna do?

51:05.902 --> 51:08.704
There is a secret program
where local prostitutes

51:08.706 --> 51:10.505
try to convert queers
into straight,

51:10.507 --> 51:13.041
but even as Russian whores,
you two would be a stretch. No.

51:13.043 --> 51:15.510
Well, maybe you can
get us some disguises.

51:15.512 --> 51:17.545
We have to find our way inside.

51:17.547 --> 51:19.581
We could make visit
as relatives.

51:19.583 --> 51:21.083
Simple quick
“hello” and “goodbye.”

51:21.085 --> 51:22.851
It might work,
but we have to go now.

51:22.853 --> 51:25.253
Gorky Park is there.
It is way past her feeding time.

51:25.255 --> 51:26.458
Let's hurry!

51:27.992 --> 51:29.461
Come on, Debbie!

51:35.132 --> 51:37.202
Make fast.
Secret police everywhere.

51:38.568 --> 51:40.137
No one's gonna believe
these disguises.

51:41.105 --> 51:42.840
I've never felt so pretty.

51:44.875 --> 51:47.543
Eh... All Russian women
look like man.

51:47.545 --> 51:48.776
Who can tell difference?

51:48.778 --> 51:51.713
Now, we're just
relatives visiting, sisters.

51:51.715 --> 51:53.651
Now go to door on right.
They let you in.

51:54.117 --> 51:56.584
Wait, wait, wait.
You're not coming with us?

51:56.586 --> 51:58.753
No. Is too dangerous for Katya.

51:58.755 --> 52:01.789
If I don't get to see you,
it was nice to meet you...

52:01.791 --> 52:02.858
and good luck...

52:02.860 --> 52:04.559
You'll need it.
Bye.

52:04.561 --> 52:05.963
Wait, I...

52:06.163 --> 52:06.963
Come on.

52:10.099 --> 52:11.566
When we get inside,
I'm gonna get

52:11.568 --> 52:13.568
all the information
from Carly that I can.

52:13.570 --> 52:14.903
Yeah, funny coming from you.

52:14.905 --> 52:16.338
You don't even know
the difference between

52:16.340 --> 52:18.206
french bread and a french braid!

52:18.208 --> 52:19.675
I'll take care of it.

52:19.677 --> 52:21.809
You!
You fell for this entire scam.

52:21.811 --> 52:23.177
You thought you
were gettin' prize money

52:23.179 --> 52:25.246
for a science fair
in Russia.

52:25.248 --> 52:27.682
I mean suck it, fag lady!
I won!

52:27.684 --> 52:30.251
Can you please keep it down?!
Here come those horny rats!

52:30.253 --> 52:31.522
Go, go!

52:41.331 --> 52:46.136
Category is...
prison drag realness.

52:59.882 --> 53:01.650
This look doesn't
“Jail House Rock”

53:01.652 --> 53:04.086
so much as give me
“Folsom Prison Blues.”

53:04.088 --> 53:06.722
Oh, it's not that bad.
Maybe a little tight.

53:06.724 --> 53:07.856
Tight?

53:07.858 --> 53:11.228
She should get ten to life
for murdering those seams.

53:12.161 --> 53:14.061
Okay, playtime is over.

53:14.063 --> 53:15.332
Back inside.

53:17.735 --> 53:18.900
You have visitor.

53:18.902 --> 53:20.369
You, too, tranny.

53:20.371 --> 53:22.170
I'm obviously in
the middle of something.

53:22.172 --> 53:23.304
Who is it?

53:23.306 --> 53:25.240
It's mean woman with fat ass.

53:25.242 --> 53:26.778
Oh, that's Bianca.

53:33.117 --> 53:34.349
I don't know her.

53:34.351 --> 53:35.920
I can see you.

53:39.188 --> 53:40.222
<i>Nyet!</i>

53:40.224 --> 53:41.322
No touch!

53:41.324 --> 53:42.324
I wouldn't touch her.

53:42.326 --> 53:44.860
She's like a vending machine
full of STDs.

53:44.862 --> 53:46.095
How did you get in here?

53:46.097 --> 53:48.996
Well, obviously, I told them
I was your much younger sister.

53:48.998 --> 53:51.400
They're stupid, not blind.

53:51.402 --> 53:53.834
Anyway, where is your
whole Bianca del Rio?

53:53.836 --> 53:56.371
This is not
what I was expecting.

53:56.373 --> 53:57.773
Don't you remember?

53:57.775 --> 53:59.775
They took Bianca.
She is gone.

53:59.777 --> 54:02.778
Everything you need
is in the suitcase.

54:02.780 --> 54:04.211
You worry too much.

54:04.213 --> 54:06.748
This place is much nicer
than our hotel, by the way.

54:06.750 --> 54:08.316
At least here has room service.

54:08.318 --> 54:10.818
And what are you gonna do
if they send you to Siberia

54:10.820 --> 54:13.156
and make you eat
someone to stay alive?

54:13.856 --> 54:15.257
Is he hot?

54:15.259 --> 54:16.293
Focus!

54:16.760 --> 54:18.193
How you holdin' up, Carly?

54:18.195 --> 54:19.860
Well, I'd be a lot better
if I wasn't

54:19.862 --> 54:21.862
stuck in a Russian prison,
thanks to you.

54:21.864 --> 54:24.032
We've got to beat those queers!

54:24.034 --> 54:25.967
You know how important it is.

54:25.969 --> 54:27.735
All you think about is Bianca.

54:27.737 --> 54:29.170
You don't even care
what happens to me.

54:29.172 --> 54:31.840
Maybe those homos
aren't so bad, Mama.

54:31.842 --> 54:34.075
I mean when Jacklyn Smith
tried to stab me,

54:34.077 --> 54:36.077
Rex is the one
that protected me -

54:36.079 --> 54:37.945
a lot more than you ever did.

54:37.947 --> 54:39.116
That fruit fly?

54:40.117 --> 54:41.916
Yeah. I think
you're wrong about them.

54:41.918 --> 54:43.784
Nah. You don't mean that.

54:43.786 --> 54:45.420
It's got to be
the Old Spice talkin'.

54:45.422 --> 54:47.121
Listen. I don't
want you to worry,

54:47.123 --> 54:48.456
but we are trying
to work on a plan

54:48.458 --> 54:49.858
to get you out of here.

54:49.860 --> 54:51.025
I'm not worried.

54:51.027 --> 54:53.195
I've made this prison my bitch.

54:53.197 --> 54:55.197
All the queens
work for me now,

54:55.199 --> 54:57.798
and that hot guard
feeds me three times a day.

54:57.800 --> 54:59.367
He brings you food?

54:59.369 --> 55:01.036
Not exactly.

55:01.038 --> 55:03.804
Now, Bianca and I are gonna get
you both out of here together,

55:03.806 --> 55:05.974
but I got a plan of my own.

55:05.976 --> 55:07.508
Another plan, Mama?

55:07.510 --> 55:09.411
Yeah. Bianca thinks
I'm gonna help her,

55:09.413 --> 55:10.479
but once you're free,

55:10.481 --> 55:13.315
I'm gonna expose her
for what she is, and bam!

55:13.317 --> 55:14.349
She's gone!

55:14.351 --> 55:16.784
You would do that
after she helps get me out?

55:16.786 --> 55:18.353
It's what we came here for.

55:18.355 --> 55:21.990
I'm not leaving Russia till
Bianca's locked up forever.

55:23.193 --> 55:25.860
Listen. There's got to be
another way to get in here.

55:25.862 --> 55:28.162
Do you think I could pass
as one of those guards?

55:28.164 --> 55:30.231
Hmm...
Origami is straighter than you.

55:30.233 --> 55:31.867
The only other option
is actually

55:31.869 --> 55:33.934
better suited for you
than it is for me.

55:33.936 --> 55:36.170
Oh, you mean the hookers!

55:36.172 --> 55:39.340
Yeah. We have straight
conversion therapy tomorrow.

55:39.342 --> 55:42.846
I'm gonna have sex with a
gross Russian skank for science.

55:44.081 --> 55:46.914
I can't wait
to spank that bitch.

55:46.916 --> 55:48.316
No touch!

55:48.318 --> 55:50.318
That's not what
you said last night.

55:50.320 --> 55:51.318
Time is up.

55:51.320 --> 55:54.125
- Bye, Sis.
- Bye.

55:59.496 --> 56:02.363
These disguises barely got us
to the door as family.

56:02.365 --> 56:04.099
No one's ever gonna believe
that we're hookers,

56:04.101 --> 56:05.566
not even here in Russia.

56:05.568 --> 56:07.235
We can't just
leave Carly in there.

56:07.237 --> 56:09.003
Prison's doin'
terrible things to her.

56:09.005 --> 56:10.572
She's not strong like I am.

56:10.574 --> 56:13.074
I know. You can pull a cart.

56:13.076 --> 56:14.909
Okay. Insult me all you want,

56:14.911 --> 56:16.378
but I got to get
my daughter back.

56:16.380 --> 56:18.246
Okay, fine.
I will work out a plan

56:18.248 --> 56:21.316
to get Rex and your atrocious
offspring out of prison.

56:21.318 --> 56:22.950
If you had
that wig on right now,

56:22.952 --> 56:24.385
I'd snatch it
right off your head.

56:24.387 --> 56:25.987
Yeah, that's the
difference between us.

56:25.989 --> 56:27.988
I'd just snatch out your
own hair from the root.

56:30.393 --> 56:32.362
- Ya hungry?
- I could eat.

56:45.409 --> 56:46.510
Nothing.

56:50.047 --> 56:53.882
That glue-sniffin' dummy
is gonna end up in Siberia...

56:53.884 --> 56:55.519
If Gorky doesn't eat him first.

56:56.853 --> 56:59.089
Well, at last he's gettin' laid.

57:14.237 --> 57:17.371
Oh, look.
It's me in a faggy tie.

57:17.373 --> 57:19.974
Bianca del Rio,
what are you doing here?

57:19.976 --> 57:22.344
This is your
'come to Jesus' moment, Richard,

57:22.346 --> 57:25.146
but Jesus was busy,
so you got me.

57:25.148 --> 57:27.081
But how am I gonna
get Rex out of prison?

57:27.083 --> 57:29.251
Rex can take care of himself.

57:29.253 --> 57:30.952
You baby him too much.

57:30.954 --> 57:32.586
He is literally an adult baby.

57:32.588 --> 57:35.590
Anything he can grab, he sticks
up his nose or in his mouth.

57:35.592 --> 57:36.825
Or ass.

57:36.827 --> 57:39.327
Rex is a lot like wig glue,
more versatile than you think.

57:39.329 --> 57:42.597
It has a lot of uses
if you put your mind to it.

57:42.599 --> 57:45.166
But how am I gonna
get him out of that prison?

57:45.168 --> 57:46.434
Find me.

57:46.436 --> 57:49.970
Your way in is your way out.

57:49.972 --> 57:53.340
Eating Chinese food
late at night is a big mistake.

57:53.342 --> 57:55.476
Now I'm dreamin'
in fortune cookie.

57:55.478 --> 57:59.146
How is Rex like a
vending machine full of STDs?

57:59.148 --> 58:02.284
‘Cause when you put
three quarters in, you get one.

58:02.286 --> 58:04.422
Get out of my head.

58:10.460 --> 58:11.929
Dream over.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.469
I come up with my
best insults while sleeping.

58:19.969 --> 58:20.971
Wig glue.

58:32.014 --> 58:33.516
Shit!

58:44.527 --> 58:50.367
International overnight delivery
for Richard Martinez, huh?

58:53.135 --> 58:54.501
Um, wh...?

58:54.503 --> 58:55.672
Hey, hey! Wha...?

59:02.579 --> 59:04.378
, bitch!

59:06.650 --> 59:08.416
What the hell does that mean?

59:08.418 --> 59:11.086
I think it's “halleloo”
in Russian.

59:11.088 --> 59:12.619
- Yes!
- I have a better question.

59:12.621 --> 59:14.322
What the hell
are you doing in a box?

59:14.324 --> 59:17.358
Honey, airfare is expensive
and, you know,

59:17.360 --> 59:19.494
some of us didn't win
“RuPaul's Drag Race.”

59:19.496 --> 59:21.295
Ooh, the girls are hateful.
You'll see.

59:21.297 --> 59:23.999
I don't watch
reality television.

59:24.001 --> 59:25.666
Well, it turns out that
that “Frontline” episode

59:25.668 --> 59:28.003
on human trafficking
is a lot more informative

59:28.005 --> 59:29.537
than I think
it was meant to be.

59:29.539 --> 59:32.106
Well, I'm not sure
if that's good or bad.

59:32.108 --> 59:35.709
Whoa, baby, with me, it's
always a good thing because...

59:35.711 --> 59:39.179
say hello to my little friend.

59:40.650 --> 59:42.316
I love you.

59:42.318 --> 59:44.084
You old bitch.

59:44.086 --> 59:46.021
Old? Honey, you must be
talkin' to that wig,

59:46.023 --> 59:48.188
because you know there are
at least ten years

59:48.190 --> 59:49.557
between me and you.

59:49.559 --> 59:50.825
Well, let me tell you this -

59:50.827 --> 59:53.728
Rex is gonna have ten years in
prison if we don't get him out,

59:53.730 --> 59:57.097
but I think I have a plan.

59:57.099 --> 59:58.566
Ohhh!!!

59:58.568 --> 01:00:00.534
Do you have a plan
to get me out of this box?

01:00:00.536 --> 01:00:02.237
- Come on, girl. Just lean...
- Bitch, I know.

01:00:02.239 --> 01:00:03.604
Honey, the overage charges
for the weight.

01:00:03.606 --> 01:00:05.373
They tried to say I was
150 pounds, bitch.

01:00:05.375 --> 01:00:06.443
Ahhh!

01:00:35.271 --> 01:00:37.338
<i>Ooh! You look fabulous!</i>

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:40.474
See, I told you...
Bianca will fix everything.

01:00:40.476 --> 01:00:43.545
Oh, girl, it's just drag,
not a cure for herpes.

01:00:43.547 --> 01:00:45.380
No, honey, if you want
a cure for herpes,

01:00:45.382 --> 01:00:47.548
you leave Rex up in
that solitary confinement.

01:00:49.518 --> 01:00:53.454
You know, there's only
one more thing we need...

01:00:53.456 --> 01:00:54.692
Oh, Deborah!

01:00:55.425 --> 01:00:57.791
Bianca del Rio...

01:00:57.793 --> 01:00:59.860
as I live and breathe.

01:00:59.862 --> 01:01:01.695
Yeah, we'll fix that later.

01:01:01.697 --> 01:01:03.865
We've got lots
of work to do...

01:01:03.867 --> 01:01:05.236
on you.

01:01:42.539 --> 01:01:44.905
I've been waitin' a long time
for this makeover.

01:01:44.907 --> 01:01:46.441
How do I look?

01:01:46.443 --> 01:01:48.342
Well, when I said I wanted
to rearrange your face,

01:01:48.344 --> 01:01:49.878
this is not what I had in mind.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.378
My feet are killin' me.

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.280
How do you fruits walk
in these heels anyway?

01:01:53.282 --> 01:01:55.219
A lifetime of
pain and sufferin'.

01:01:55.684 --> 01:01:57.619
Hi. You must be Sacha.

01:01:57.621 --> 01:01:58.820
I'm Bianca del Rio.

01:01:58.822 --> 01:02:01.289
You're a fancy prostitute?

01:02:01.291 --> 01:02:04.391
I have no money,
not even for the short one.

01:02:04.393 --> 01:02:05.492
Uh, no.

01:02:05.494 --> 01:02:07.628
We're actually here
looking for my friend Mitya.

01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:09.463
Dmitriy.
He was here yesterday,

01:02:09.465 --> 01:02:11.465
and I do believe
that's his potato.

01:02:11.467 --> 01:02:12.700
Not here.

01:02:12.702 --> 01:02:14.702
At government job.

01:02:14.704 --> 01:02:17.871
Today, I watch potato!

01:02:17.873 --> 01:02:19.440
What's the big deal
with the potato?

01:02:19.442 --> 01:02:20.807
There is line for potato.

01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:23.443
Hey, calm down, Potato Lady!

01:02:23.445 --> 01:02:25.748
Um, Bianca's her pimp.

01:02:26.382 --> 01:02:28.215
Listen.
We need chemicals.

01:02:28.217 --> 01:02:29.617
This is a science fair,
isn't it?

01:02:29.619 --> 01:02:30.818
There's got to be
some place around here

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:34.655
we can buy or steal supplies
to make a chemical reaction.

01:02:34.657 --> 01:02:36.891
If you need work, I am also,

01:02:36.893 --> 01:02:39.394
how you say, uh, pimp.

01:02:39.396 --> 01:02:40.228
Oh.

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:43.463
These girls over here,
not my best.

01:02:43.465 --> 01:02:45.499
But prison not so picky.

01:02:46.436 --> 01:02:49.272
This place might have
what you look for.

01:02:50.206 --> 01:02:51.539
Thank you.

01:02:51.541 --> 01:02:53.675
Come on, girls.
We've got some shopping to do.

01:02:53.677 --> 01:02:55.742
We've got some shit to blow up.

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:06.420
<i>The secret prison
is under the Kremlin.</i>

01:03:06.422 --> 01:03:08.555
We only saw the visitor center
in the front,

01:03:08.557 --> 01:03:10.525
which means the prisoners
are in the back.

01:03:10.527 --> 01:03:12.626
Okay, this is a crazy plan,
even for you.

01:03:12.628 --> 01:03:13.628
Oh, shut up.

01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:15.630
Now you, you've got to
pass these around

01:03:15.632 --> 01:03:16.898
and wait for my signal.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:19.601
I'm not sure if it's enough
to put the Kremlin in orbit,

01:03:19.603 --> 01:03:21.536
but it definitely
will crack a few walls.

01:03:21.538 --> 01:03:22.537
Now hold up now.

01:03:22.539 --> 01:03:24.639
This is not gonna
go off in my hand, right?

01:03:24.641 --> 01:03:27.641
No! It's stable
until you use the detonator.

01:03:27.643 --> 01:03:29.245
You did bring the detonator?

01:03:29.579 --> 01:03:31.545
- It's in my wig.
- Good.

01:03:31.547 --> 01:03:32.546
Wait a minute, though.

01:03:32.548 --> 01:03:35.383
So they're supposed to
hire ya'll hookers

01:03:35.385 --> 01:03:36.851
to seduce the gays?

01:03:36.853 --> 01:03:38.222
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:03:38.887 --> 01:03:39.923
Hmm.

01:03:40.322 --> 01:03:41.255
Well, what are you gonna do

01:03:41.257 --> 01:03:43.291
if they try to make you
have sex with Rex?

01:03:43.293 --> 01:03:46.628
I'm totally gonna bite down on
the cyanide capsule in my molar.

01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:47.795
You guys, look.

01:03:47.797 --> 01:03:49.329
We're totally like
"Charlie's Angels" right now.

01:03:49.331 --> 01:03:50.865
Do-da-loo, do-da-loo,
do-da-loo...

01:03:50.867 --> 01:03:52.700
Hey...
You're Bosley.

01:03:52.702 --> 01:03:54.802
Oh, God.
Here. Take this.

01:03:54.804 --> 01:03:56.570
Here's the rest of ‘em.
Get ‘em and go.

01:03:56.572 --> 01:03:58.208
Beat it, queen.
Do your job!

01:03:59.009 --> 01:04:00.041
Now listen, Debbie.

01:04:00.043 --> 01:04:01.909
I know we have not
seen eye to eye,

01:04:01.911 --> 01:04:04.378
because I've seen
wiener dogs taller than you,

01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:06.380
but you and I really need
to work together

01:04:06.382 --> 01:04:07.682
to make this happen.

01:04:07.684 --> 01:04:08.983
You can count on me,

01:04:08.985 --> 01:04:11.318
and I'm not just sayin'
I'll work with you now

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.287
so I can double-cross you later.

01:04:13.289 --> 01:04:14.657
- What?
- What?

01:04:26.469 --> 01:04:28.271
- Tits up.
- I'm tryin'.

01:04:31.307 --> 01:04:32.407
Da?

01:04:32.409 --> 01:04:34.941
Hi. We're the prostitutes
here to fix the fags.

01:04:34.943 --> 01:04:37.744
Yeah, uh, we're here
to cure all the fags.

01:04:37.746 --> 01:04:40.250
Calm down.
I got this, Mother Teresa.

01:04:42.552 --> 01:04:46.753
We've done worse,
but not much worse.

01:04:46.755 --> 01:04:47.755
Come inside.

01:04:47.757 --> 01:04:49.960
Hmm...
Don't mind if I do.

01:04:50.994 --> 01:04:52.262
Told ya.

01:04:52.528 --> 01:04:53.594
<i>Comrade!</i>

01:04:53.596 --> 01:04:55.362
We must to get to prison.

01:04:55.364 --> 01:04:58.066
I feel a presence
I have not felt since...

01:04:58.068 --> 01:05:00.501
the last time your hand
was on my ass.

01:05:00.503 --> 01:05:01.472
Knock it off.

01:05:02.539 --> 01:05:04.104
Don't mind the rats.
The rats don't mind you.

01:05:04.106 --> 01:05:06.474
I really like what
you've done with the place.

01:05:06.476 --> 01:05:07.941
It's so drab.

01:05:07.943 --> 01:05:11.045
That's the radiation.
We have leaky pipe. Watch step.

01:05:11.047 --> 01:05:13.014
Is that Plutonium?

01:05:13.016 --> 01:05:15.583
Oh, that's Uranium-235.

01:05:15.585 --> 01:05:17.117
- Very good.
- Thanks.

01:05:17.119 --> 01:05:18.885
Prisoner today
thought it was Gatorade.

01:05:18.887 --> 01:05:20.021
Stupid homo.

01:05:20.023 --> 01:05:22.757
You're smarter
than most whores we get.

01:05:22.759 --> 01:05:24.925
- Oh, well.
- But just as homey.

01:05:24.927 --> 01:05:26.994
I'm sure you mean homely.

01:05:26.996 --> 01:05:29.697
No, homey.
My mother was whore.

01:05:29.699 --> 01:05:30.800
In you go.

01:05:31.701 --> 01:05:34.735
- Uh...
- Uh, so what do we have to do?

01:05:34.737 --> 01:05:39.106
Fix homo and I pay you
one potato each.

01:05:39.108 --> 01:05:43.110
One potato, two potato,
three potato...

01:05:43.112 --> 01:05:44.414
Nyet!

01:05:44.713 --> 01:05:46.113
He seems nice.

01:05:49.952 --> 01:05:52.720
Just to get set up.

01:05:52.722 --> 01:05:54.054
Then we begin.

01:05:54.056 --> 01:05:56.456
Now I've been to
some kinky shit,

01:05:56.458 --> 01:05:58.861
but this is weird,
even for me.

01:05:59.762 --> 01:06:02.463
I can't wait to see the skank
you picked out for me, though.

01:06:02.465 --> 01:06:04.367
I hope she's awful.

01:06:05.101 --> 01:06:07.168
Oh, she is.

01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:09.070
I thought there was
gonna be more hookers.

01:06:09.072 --> 01:06:10.405
I think it's just us.

01:06:10.407 --> 01:06:11.440
How does this work?

01:06:11.442 --> 01:06:13.173
Well, they've got him
strapped to that machine

01:06:13.175 --> 01:06:15.478
to test his sexual response.

01:06:16.079 --> 01:06:17.878
Don't you watch
“Masters of Sex?”

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:19.112
Premium cable?

01:06:19.114 --> 01:06:21.449
I'm a teacher,
not a lottery winner.

01:06:21.451 --> 01:06:23.150
There's a lot of lotteries
you didn't win.

01:06:23.152 --> 01:06:25.853
While you're down there...

01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:28.588
Yes, daddy!

01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:29.990
<i>Oh... Oh, look at that.</i>

01:06:29.992 --> 01:06:31.858
Now listen.
They're gonna pick one of us,

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:33.094
hopefully you,

01:06:33.096 --> 01:06:36.563
to go over there and grope him
to see if they can turn him on.

01:06:36.565 --> 01:06:39.099
Once he pops a boner,
he's out of here, free.

01:06:39.101 --> 01:06:40.802
This doesn't make sense.

01:06:40.804 --> 01:06:44.938
We're in drag in a secret
Russian prison under the Kremlin

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:47.575
tryin' to turn this
gay slut straight.

01:06:47.577 --> 01:06:50.644
And it's not like you sailed
here on the good ship Logic,

01:06:50.646 --> 01:06:51.748
did ya?

01:06:56.518 --> 01:06:58.721
Buy a lady a drink first.

01:06:59.188 --> 01:07:01.521
I'll take an Old Spice.

01:07:01.523 --> 01:07:03.624
- Neat.
- We must to test you.

01:07:03.626 --> 01:07:05.193
Okay, which hooker you want?

01:07:05.195 --> 01:07:07.728
Oh, this is like
“Sophie's Choice,”

01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:10.798
except I want to be the kid
who goes to the gas chamber.

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.066
Is that an option?

01:07:12.068 --> 01:07:13.601
I pick for you.

01:07:13.603 --> 01:07:15.036
Now listen.
I wanna help Rex,

01:07:15.038 --> 01:07:17.572
but if she picks me, I don't
know if I can do this.

01:07:17.574 --> 01:07:18.905
It's gonna be me anyway.

01:07:18.907 --> 01:07:20.208
I'm way prettier than you.

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:23.110
You really haven't caught onto
this whole homosexuality thing,

01:07:23.112 --> 01:07:24.679
have ya, Debbie?

01:07:24.681 --> 01:07:26.481
Stop callin' me Debbie!

01:07:26.483 --> 01:07:27.815
Rex is a walking hard-on.

01:07:27.817 --> 01:07:29.150
All you have to do
is go near him.

01:07:29.152 --> 01:07:31.755
He'll pop a boner.
You're a very lucky lady.

01:07:32.255 --> 01:07:34.921
Okay...
Show me hands.

01:07:34.923 --> 01:07:36.691
Thumbs up! Hands.

01:07:36.693 --> 01:07:37.858
Okay. Okay.

01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:39.860
No syphilis,
but we use them anyway.

01:07:39.862 --> 01:07:40.795
Come on.

01:07:40.797 --> 01:07:42.963
You very old whore.
You know what to do.

01:07:42.965 --> 01:07:45.099
Right here? Right now?
In this lighting?

01:07:45.101 --> 01:07:48.936
Make this queer a real man
or you both die in Siberia.

01:07:48.938 --> 01:07:51.171
I thought I was
getting a potato.

01:07:51.173 --> 01:07:53.974
Potato is for closers.

01:07:53.976 --> 01:07:56.846
There's got to be another way.

01:07:57.246 --> 01:07:59.012
Maybe Siberia's not so bad.

01:07:59.014 --> 01:08:00.648
Oh, please.
You know you want this.

01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:02.617
You've wanted this
since the night we met.

01:08:02.619 --> 01:08:04.784
I tripped over you
in a snow bank.

01:08:04.786 --> 01:08:06.186
I thought you were homeless.

01:08:06.188 --> 01:08:08.021
Oh, yeah? Then why
did you try to kiss me, huh?

01:08:08.023 --> 01:08:11.057
That wasn't a kiss.
I was giving you mouth-to-mouth.

01:08:11.059 --> 01:08:12.592
You weren't breathing.

01:08:12.594 --> 01:08:14.931
Well, I'm breathing now.

01:08:18.868 --> 01:08:20.600
If I throw up in my mouth,

01:08:20.603 --> 01:08:22.702
it's not gonna be good
for either one of us.

01:08:22.703 --> 01:08:25.606
Talking costs extra!
No more potato.

01:08:25.608 --> 01:08:27.743
Kiss! Kiss now!

01:08:30.313 --> 01:08:31.879
Wait. Before we do this,

01:08:31.881 --> 01:08:34.314
Richard, Richard,
something I have to say.

01:08:34.317 --> 01:08:35.450
What?

01:08:35.452 --> 01:08:39.687
If Deborah is over there
wearing my wig, I will kill you.

01:08:39.689 --> 01:08:41.692
Not if this kills me first.

01:08:47.564 --> 01:08:49.263
No response.

01:08:49.265 --> 01:08:50.263
Sorry.

01:08:50.265 --> 01:08:53.667
I smell cabbage.
Is anybody boiling cabbage?

01:08:53.670 --> 01:08:55.902
Listen.
This is no fun for me either.

01:08:55.904 --> 01:08:59.839
Now focus, or I swear to God
I will fist you like a Muppet!

01:08:59.841 --> 01:09:02.209
Thanks for the dirty talk,
but I don't think it'll help.

01:09:02.211 --> 01:09:05.178
Maybe if you tilt your head
a little so I can see the guard.

01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:06.981
No response.
Come on. Again!

01:09:06.983 --> 01:09:08.848
Again! Kiss.

01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:11.184
I really wish there
was cyanide in my molar.

01:09:11.185 --> 01:09:12.921
Then we could both die.

01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:16.723
I mean, you know it's a sin,

01:09:16.725 --> 01:09:19.662
but you're just not prepared
for how gross it is.

01:09:25.033 --> 01:09:27.968
Definitely boiled cabbage.

01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:29.336
Maybe with some turnips?

01:09:29.337 --> 01:09:30.870
Is anybody hungry?

01:09:30.872 --> 01:09:32.675
- Nothing.
- Sorry I'm late.

01:09:35.278 --> 01:09:38.011
Rex, look. It's the guy
from the science fair.

01:09:38.014 --> 01:09:39.746
I didn't think
he was cute then

01:09:39.747 --> 01:09:41.915
and I don't think
it'll help now.

01:09:41.917 --> 01:09:43.683
Oh, I make adjustment.

01:09:43.685 --> 01:09:45.854
Honestly, I thought
he was hotter as Katya.

01:09:46.689 --> 01:09:48.022
Wait. What?

01:09:48.024 --> 01:09:49.725
Nice to meet ya.

01:09:52.795 --> 01:09:54.294
How did you miss that?
I would think

01:09:54.296 --> 01:09:56.599
your nerdy senses
would have been tingling.

01:09:57.667 --> 01:09:59.032
You are a science teacher.

01:09:59.034 --> 01:10:00.269
You know what to do.

01:10:05.807 --> 01:10:06.944
All fine now.

01:10:07.644 --> 01:10:09.777
Listen. If you
try to stick your tongue

01:10:09.779 --> 01:10:12.315
down my throat again,
you're gonna taste my lunch.

01:10:23.192 --> 01:10:25.159
Success!

01:10:25.161 --> 01:10:26.393
Yay!

01:10:26.395 --> 01:10:27.727
Yay!

01:10:27.729 --> 01:10:30.330
Oh, yes! Success!

01:10:30.332 --> 01:10:34.168
Yay. Success!

01:10:34.170 --> 01:10:35.838
Success!

01:10:36.972 --> 01:10:39.342
Hey, take him back to his cell.

01:10:40.943 --> 01:10:43.947
Wait! I-I thought they were
released once they were cured!

01:10:44.413 --> 01:10:47.348
Girl, please.
Look at him.

01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:49.316
He need many more treatment,

01:10:49.318 --> 01:10:52.085
but at least you
don't go to Siberia.

01:10:52.087 --> 01:10:53.454
What about Carly?

01:10:53.456 --> 01:10:55.790
Curly? Who is this Curly?

01:10:55.792 --> 01:10:57.825
Shut your face, Debbie!

01:10:57.827 --> 01:10:59.226
You have my daughter, Carly.

01:10:59.228 --> 01:11:01.728
She isn't one of these flamers.
Let her go!

01:11:01.730 --> 01:11:03.164
You keep Bianca.

01:11:03.166 --> 01:11:04.964
Let me know
how this all plays out.

01:11:04.966 --> 01:11:07.237
I've got a man waiting for me.

01:11:11.039 --> 01:11:13.777
Oops. Baby made a boom boom.

01:11:18.914 --> 01:11:21.147
What is going on here?

01:11:21.149 --> 01:11:23.116
Mitya, what have you done?

01:11:23.118 --> 01:11:25.719
This hooker
is a flaming drag queen

01:11:25.721 --> 01:11:27.987
and a degenerate homosexual.

01:11:27.989 --> 01:11:29.924
I'm the real woman here, okay?

01:11:29.926 --> 01:11:31.357
You can take her.

01:11:31.359 --> 01:11:33.994
Bianca del Rio
is the one that you want.

01:11:33.996 --> 01:11:36.296
You thought those heels
were killing you before;

01:11:36.298 --> 01:11:38.264
wait till I get a hold of you.

01:11:38.266 --> 01:11:40.768
Okay, that's it. Guard!

01:11:40.770 --> 01:11:42.937
Take homo to cell!

01:11:42.939 --> 01:11:46.507
I stay with Mitya and these
prostitutes till you get back!

01:11:46.509 --> 01:11:49.143
Come on.
Go, go, go, go.

01:11:49.145 --> 01:11:50.376
Let's go.

01:11:50.378 --> 01:11:52.746
This is great.
Now we're both gonna rot

01:11:52.748 --> 01:11:54.781
in this rat-infested
prison together.

01:11:54.783 --> 01:11:56.282
You brought this
on yourself, homo.

01:11:56.284 --> 01:11:57.918
Oh, yeah. They're probably
gonna put us

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.085
in a cell together
with each other.

01:11:59.087 --> 01:12:00.454
Wouldn't you like that, Debbie?

01:12:00.456 --> 01:12:04.761
Never call me Debbie!!!!

01:12:05.994 --> 01:12:08.329
Oh, no.
That voice. The rats.

01:12:08.331 --> 01:12:10.263
Deb-bie. Deb-bie.

01:12:10.265 --> 01:12:12.866
Debbie, Debbie, Debbie.
Bzzz!

01:12:12.868 --> 01:12:15.936
Stop that! You stop that
with your faggy ties,

01:12:15.938 --> 01:12:18.772
your clown makeup,
your nasty one-liners,

01:12:18.774 --> 01:12:20.875
and your purse full of bees!

01:12:20.877 --> 01:12:24.945
You stop calling me Debbie!!!!

01:12:24.947 --> 01:12:27.548
Oh, no.
Is mating season!

01:12:27.550 --> 01:12:29.286
Whoa!

01:12:31.854 --> 01:12:33.787
<i>Little Debbie with her
Holly Hobbie dresses.</i>

01:12:33.789 --> 01:12:35.458
Little Debbie
with a lip gloss addiction.

01:12:36.192 --> 01:12:37.892
You stop that!

01:12:37.894 --> 01:12:39.860
<i>They called me
Little Debbie Snack Cake!</i>

01:12:39.862 --> 01:12:41.795
<i>I was the shortest one
in school!</i>

01:12:41.797 --> 01:12:43.897
You're just as mean as they are!

01:12:43.899 --> 01:12:46.402
<i>You stop teasing me!</i>

01:12:50.273 --> 01:12:53.374
Oh, no, no, no, no!

01:12:53.376 --> 01:12:55.378
They coming, they coming.

01:12:56.912 --> 01:12:58.180
Oh!

01:12:59.815 --> 01:13:01.147
Oh, no, they coming.

01:13:01.149 --> 01:13:03.987
They coming
to mate with my face.

01:13:04.921 --> 01:13:08.024
They-they-
they mate with my face!

01:13:15.497 --> 01:13:16.964
You don't have a key?

01:13:16.966 --> 01:13:18.531
Nyet. Maybe if I had wig,

01:13:18.533 --> 01:13:20.401
I could take bobby pin,
but I have nothing.

01:13:20.403 --> 01:13:22.102
Looks like we're next.

01:13:22.104 --> 01:13:23.603
Well, you see,
ever since Debbie here

01:13:23.605 --> 01:13:25.906
and her brother kidnapped me
and left me to die in the woods,

01:13:25.908 --> 01:13:27.273
I never leave home without this.

01:13:27.275 --> 01:13:28.875
I don't have time
for this!

01:13:28.877 --> 01:13:30.277
I don't have time for you!

01:13:30.279 --> 01:13:31.848
All right! Let's go,

01:13:36.551 --> 01:13:38.485
The prisoners
were kept downstairs.

01:13:38.487 --> 01:13:40.123
We must to hurry.

01:13:43.158 --> 01:13:45.226
That works perfectly, Deborah.

01:13:45.228 --> 01:13:46.427
Wait. What?

01:13:46.429 --> 01:13:49.229
Your voice...
It brought the rats.

01:13:49.231 --> 01:13:51.234
I told you we needed
to work together.

01:13:54.936 --> 01:13:57.004
They must to feed us soon.

01:13:57.006 --> 01:13:58.975
Gorky get hungry.

01:13:59.175 --> 01:14:01.177
What the hell?!
No, no!

01:14:01.944 --> 01:14:03.380
Look! They are here.

01:14:05.448 --> 01:14:07.414
- Mama, is that you?
- Carly!

01:14:07.416 --> 01:14:10.317
Oh, I couldn't leave
my baby here in prison.

01:14:10.319 --> 01:14:13.053
Listen, you guys, I'm gonna
have you out in no time.

01:14:13.055 --> 01:14:15.522
You and Bianca
are workin' together.

01:14:15.524 --> 01:14:16.790
Just to get you out of here.

01:14:16.792 --> 01:14:19.460
Don't worry. She's gonna get
what's comin' to her.

01:14:19.462 --> 01:14:22.396
Mama, haven't you learned
anything from all this?

01:14:22.398 --> 01:14:25.366
Well, I learned I look
pretty fierce as a blond,

01:14:25.368 --> 01:14:27.871
and did you know
rats have a mating season?

01:14:31.407 --> 01:14:34.508
It's okay, girl.
He's with me.

01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:37.410
I told you
I could take care of myself.

01:14:37.412 --> 01:14:38.912
I wish you
would have told me that

01:14:38.914 --> 01:14:40.446
before I had to
make out with you.

01:14:40.448 --> 01:14:41.483
Excuse me.

01:14:46.322 --> 01:14:47.524
You are free to go.

01:14:47.989 --> 01:14:49.291
Stay down, stay down.

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.929
Carly, you're free!

01:14:53.529 --> 01:14:55.161
I am.

01:14:55.163 --> 01:14:57.630
Now, help me
shove Bianca in here.

01:14:57.632 --> 01:14:59.232
It's what we came here to do.

01:14:59.234 --> 01:15:00.968
No, Mama. I can't.

01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:03.336
- What?
- You're right. I am free.

01:15:03.338 --> 01:15:05.104
Finally free of you.

01:15:05.106 --> 01:15:08.142
No! Carly!
What are you doing?

01:15:08.144 --> 01:15:10.076
These flamers
turned you against me?

01:15:10.078 --> 01:15:12.079
They're just people
just like you and me, Mama,

01:15:12.081 --> 01:15:13.379
tryin' to do the right thing.

01:15:13.381 --> 01:15:15.249
But we were never tryin'
to do the right thing.

01:15:15.251 --> 01:15:17.584
I mean all that hate -
and for what?

01:15:17.586 --> 01:15:20.120
You can't just leave me in here.

01:15:20.122 --> 01:15:21.455
Sorry, Mama.

01:15:21.457 --> 01:15:23.723
You said prison made
a new woman out of you...

01:15:23.725 --> 01:15:26.328
Well, it made a new woman
out of me, too.

01:15:27.595 --> 01:15:29.665
Noooo!!!

01:15:30.666 --> 01:15:33.536
I'll get you Bianca.
This ain't over.

01:15:34.103 --> 01:15:36.102
Looks like you're the cat.

01:15:36.104 --> 01:15:39.373
You're gonna have to
hold your own legs, bitch.

01:15:39.375 --> 01:15:40.674
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

01:15:40.676 --> 01:15:43.277
As soon as I get out of here,
I'm comin' for you, Bianca!

01:15:43.279 --> 01:15:44.481
I'm comin' for you!

01:15:45.347 --> 01:15:46.513
Oh, no.

01:15:46.515 --> 01:15:48.014
Here come those horny rats.

01:15:48.016 --> 01:15:49.184
Hey...

01:15:51.153 --> 01:15:54.356
Biancaaaa!!!!

01:16:01.029 --> 01:16:02.364
This way. Let's go.

01:16:03.198 --> 01:16:05.067
Thank you for everything.

01:16:24.653 --> 01:16:27.187
I can't believe that you
would do that to Deborah.

01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:29.356
I mean I wouldn't even
leave her in that jail cell.

01:16:29.358 --> 01:16:32.061
Well, Rex has been
nothin' but kind to me.

01:16:33.095 --> 01:16:35.161
I mean, it makes me question

01:16:35.163 --> 01:16:37.333
what this whole thing was about
in the first place.

01:16:38.333 --> 01:16:41.268
Maybe we are better together
livin' side by side,

01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:43.273
instead of tearing
each other down.

01:16:44.672 --> 01:16:47.340
Bianca has told me of snake
that bites your boobs off.

01:16:47.342 --> 01:16:48.209
Yeah.

01:16:48.211 --> 01:16:50.244
I know a doctor
who can make new again,

01:16:50.246 --> 01:16:51.211
creamy like mash potato.

01:16:51.213 --> 01:16:53.746
- Yes!
- They <i>will</i> be mash potato.

01:16:53.748 --> 01:16:56.150
Perhaps a bit lumpy,
but we do our best.

01:16:56.152 --> 01:16:57.718
Okay.

01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:59.820
Tater tits... Yeah.

01:16:59.822 --> 01:17:01.291
Let's go!

01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:06.128
I'll never forget you.

01:17:07.162 --> 01:17:09.231
Hey! Wait up.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.334
Hey, guys.
Let's blow this pop stand.

01:17:14.336 --> 01:17:16.169
- He's not coming with us?
- Who?

01:17:16.171 --> 01:17:17.370
Your new boyfriend.

01:17:17.372 --> 01:17:19.238
Oh, that was just
a prison thing.

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.473
He knows that.

01:17:20.475 --> 01:17:22.709
<i>Besides, I think
my time behind bars</i>

01:17:22.711 --> 01:17:25.446
<i>proves I don't need a man
to protect me anymore.</i>

01:17:25.448 --> 01:17:27.380
<i>What you need to
protect you is bubble wrap.</i>

01:17:27.382 --> 01:17:29.849
I've been doing just fine
in New York since you left.

01:17:29.851 --> 01:17:32.419
I don't need you to worry
about me anymore, mom!

01:17:32.421 --> 01:17:34.353
But I do worry about you.

01:17:34.355 --> 01:17:36.156
Why did you think
those bricks of cocaine

01:17:36.158 --> 01:17:37.424
in your bag would help?

01:17:37.426 --> 01:17:39.425
Not that bag...
The other bag.

01:17:39.427 --> 01:17:42.562
There were two bags,
like the ones under your eyes.

01:17:42.564 --> 01:17:44.598
All right.
You got me on that.

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.599
Look!
Is Svetlana Zlopasnost.

01:17:46.601 --> 01:17:47.670
We run now!

01:17:49.104 --> 01:17:51.405
Degenerate homosexuals
are escaping!

01:17:51.407 --> 01:17:52.742
<i>Let's get them!</i>

01:18:06.622 --> 01:18:07.754
Go!

01:18:07.756 --> 01:18:09.492
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:18:10.658 --> 01:18:12.492
Ah, sh...!

01:18:12.494 --> 01:18:14.197
Go, go, go, go.

01:18:15.864 --> 01:18:18.764
Perfect timing, as always.

01:18:18.766 --> 01:18:20.634
Girl, you know I got your back.

01:18:20.636 --> 01:18:23.202
That's ‘cause nobody
wants your front, but, uh...

01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:25.472
Oh!

01:18:25.474 --> 01:18:28.342
So that is end
of Svetlana Zlopasnost.

01:18:28.344 --> 01:18:31.544
Who is going to host next season
of “Homo Hunters?”

01:18:31.546 --> 01:18:33.213
That was a good show.

01:18:33.215 --> 01:18:34.481
R-I-P.

01:18:34.483 --> 01:18:36.549
Thanks for all
of your help, Mitya.

01:18:36.551 --> 01:18:40.620
Sorry we got your club raided
and that we blew up your job.

01:18:40.622 --> 01:18:43.557
But maybe this means that
you can come to America now.

01:18:43.559 --> 01:18:45.726
I- if you'd like to, I-I...

01:18:45.728 --> 01:18:47.727
Well, I would like it a lot.

01:18:47.729 --> 01:18:48.928
Is tempting.

01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:50.630
I would like
to know you better.

01:18:50.632 --> 01:18:52.532
But still so much work
to be done.

01:18:52.534 --> 01:18:55.936
Your Texas has given me hope
that if we stay and fight,

01:18:55.938 --> 01:18:57.803
we can have Texas, too.

01:18:57.805 --> 01:19:01.541
Oh, that is the saddest...

01:19:01.543 --> 01:19:03.910
and dumbest thing
I think I've ever heard.

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.446
I understand.

01:19:06.448 --> 01:19:08.682
You should stay and make
a bad situation better.

01:19:08.684 --> 01:19:09.950
I mean, that's the whole reason

01:19:09.952 --> 01:19:11.951
why I moved to Texas
in the first place...

01:19:11.953 --> 01:19:13.954
<i>and</i> the reason
why I'm going back.

01:19:13.956 --> 01:19:16.490
It's not just the children
that need an education.

01:19:16.492 --> 01:19:19.860
We've made some progress,
but there's still more to do.

01:19:19.862 --> 01:19:20.995
True.

01:19:20.997 --> 01:19:23.597
I'll help. I mean, if you queers
can change my mind,

01:19:23.599 --> 01:19:25.168
anyone can change.

01:19:29.738 --> 01:19:30.670
Oh, eat.

01:19:30.672 --> 01:19:33.674
Come on. Is nobody
going to eat that, huh?

01:19:45.688 --> 01:19:48.354
Is three months now since
we moved to homo house,

01:19:48.356 --> 01:19:49.889
and is great!

01:19:49.891 --> 01:19:51.724
Sometimes I miss the breeze

01:19:51.726 --> 01:19:53.727
come through
the cracks in the walls, but...

01:19:53.729 --> 01:19:56.763
And now we have central heat.

01:19:56.765 --> 01:19:58.865
When I build fire
in middle of room.

01:19:58.867 --> 01:20:01.802
In-in-in-in basement
I have swing.

01:20:01.804 --> 01:20:03.603
Oh, basement.
What treat!

01:20:03.605 --> 01:20:06.572
It's funny kind of swing
is in basement closet.

01:20:06.574 --> 01:20:08.741
Not so much with the weee!

01:20:08.743 --> 01:20:10.509
Sometimes I climb
into the swing.

01:20:10.511 --> 01:20:11.644
I hear moans.

01:20:11.646 --> 01:20:15.382
I think homo house haunted,
but it's just my Boris.

01:20:15.384 --> 01:20:16.519
Da!

01:20:17.619 --> 01:20:18.621
I like.

01:20:23.391 --> 01:20:24.724
<i>In International news,</i>

01:20:24.726 --> 01:20:26.526
<i>Russia continues to insist</i>

01:20:26.528 --> 01:20:29.662
<i>they weren't running a secret
gay prison under the Kremlin,</i>

01:20:29.664 --> 01:20:32.933
<i>and that the explosion
last month in downtown Moscow</i>

01:20:32.935 --> 01:20:35.468
<i>was just a gas leak.</i>

01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:38.472
<i>But word that dozens of gay
people have been arrested</i>

01:20:38.474 --> 01:20:41.842
<i>and imprisoned in Russia
has sparked outrage and protest</i>

01:20:41.844 --> 01:20:43.177
<i>all around the world.</i>

01:20:43.179 --> 01:20:46.446
Personally, I'm supporting gay
rights by wearin' this outfit

01:20:46.448 --> 01:20:48.949
that Roger told me
I looked great in...

01:20:48.951 --> 01:20:51.951
but I'm pretty sure he just
dressed me as Barb

01:20:51.953 --> 01:20:53.754
from “Stranger Things.”

01:20:53.756 --> 01:20:56.423
Yes. Justice for Barb.

01:20:56.425 --> 01:20:58.561
That is what it is all about.

01:20:59.528 --> 01:21:02.696
<i>It's deadly and it could
be in your purse right now.</i>

01:21:02.698 --> 01:21:04.298
<i>What is it?</i>

01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:05.969
<i>You'll find out
in the next hour.</i>

01:21:13.475 --> 01:21:14.840
Rex, no.

01:21:14.842 --> 01:21:16.009
Rex, no! Rex!

01:21:16.011 --> 01:21:17.943
If you don't bring
your whorish ass...

01:21:17.945 --> 01:21:19.282
Wooo! Rex!

01:21:48.844 --> 01:21:49.878
Ow!

01:21:50.479 --> 01:21:51.512

01:21:51.514 --> 01:21:52.812
Get that out of my face.
I'm trying to perform.

01:21:52.814 --> 01:21:54.947
I feel like a fuckin' roach.

01:21:54.949 --> 01:21:57.019
Here, like, I'm a crab?

01:22:02.725 --> 01:22:03.559

01:22:04.393 --> 01:22:06.496
You can't do this to me.

01:22:06.962 --> 01:22:08.628
I'm talkin' to a stick.

01:22:08.630 --> 01:22:10.863
How are you gonna get Bianca

01:22:10.865 --> 01:22:12.566
Oh, easy.

01:22:13.836 --> 01:22:16.902
I sent her a letter sayin'
she won a teachin' award, right?

01:22:16.904 --> 01:22:19.138
Only she has to go
to Russia to get it.

01:22:21.609 --> 01:22:22.878
Okay. Get it out, Dratch.

01:22:23.945 --> 01:22:26.612

No. Okay.

01:23:06.921 --> 01:23:08.621
Oh, God.

01:23:09.957 --> 01:23:11.491
Okay.

01:23:11.493 --> 01:23:12.862
This could be our big break.

01:23:18.132 --> 01:23:20.834
It's four AM and you're in
an old police station.

01:23:20.836 --> 01:23:23.405
I- It gets better.
It gets better.

01:23:24.872 --> 01:23:27.174
Oh, you don't like gays?
Or clowns?

01:23:27.176 --> 01:23:28.708
Shut up.

01:23:28.710 --> 01:23:30.843
Well, I think I found
Natalee Holloway.

01:24:30.872 --> 01:24:32.974
- Oh, don't look at me.

01:24:33.774 --> 01:24:34.875
