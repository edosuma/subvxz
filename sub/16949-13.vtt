On "Love and Hip Hop Hollywood:
The Reunion,"

00:04.871 --> 00:09.442
{\an5}the stage is set with lights,
and the cast is ready
for action.

00:09.509 --> 00:10.910
Shut the (bleep) up.

00:10.977 --> 00:12.178
Bitch, I wasn't
done with you.

00:12.245 --> 00:13.580
You full of (bleep),
you all fakers, (bleep).

00:13.646 --> 00:15.081
You're a punk-ass bitch.

00:15.148 --> 00:17.117
(announcer)
But the camera never lies.

00:17.183 --> 00:19.018
{\an5}I took care of your ass.

00:17.183 --> 00:19.018
When you take care of me?

00:19.085 --> 00:22.088
When you can pay for dinner,
we can talk about something.

00:22.155 --> 00:24.324
(announcer)
And it's all caught on tape.

00:24.391 --> 00:26.393
{\an5}A1 had lipo.

00:24.391 --> 00:26.393
(audience hollers)

00:26.459 --> 00:28.461
He asked her about
her pink (bleep),

00:28.528 --> 00:30.029
and she said she wanted
to (bleep) his (bleep).

00:30.096 --> 00:31.331
What?

00:31.398 --> 00:33.166
(announcer)
Everyone is under attack.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.902
He got mad 'cause I said
he has better (beep) than him.

00:35.969 --> 00:38.304
{\an5}No, no, we're not
gonna do that, hon.

00:35.969 --> 00:38.304
Just sit down.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.740
{\an5}(announcer)
As former friends
call each other out.

00:40.807 --> 00:41.975
I'm not sitting
on the couch with her.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.377
(announcer)
And enemies seek revenge.

00:44.444 --> 00:46.212
She keep on
talking (bleep) like--

00:46.279 --> 00:47.614
Your husband just had
a baby on you.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.582
So you can shut
the (bleep) up.

00:49.649 --> 00:51.418
I'm leaving,
I'll see them in court.

00:51.484 --> 00:52.652
{\an1}Good, get the (bleep)
outta here.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.554
Go to court, I got money.

00:54.621 --> 00:58.324
{\an5}(announcer)
And tonight, on part one
of "The Reunion."

00:58.391 --> 01:00.226
I'm tired of people (bleep)
running their wide-ass mouths.

01:00.293 --> 01:02.595
{\an5}At this point,
I'm kinda tired.
I'm burnt out.

01:02.662 --> 01:05.131
{\an5}(announcer)
Relationships are
destroyed for good.

01:05.197 --> 01:06.900
People are checking for me,
and nobody's checking for--

01:06.966 --> 01:08.768
Checking to see what
(bleep) you sitting on.

01:08.835 --> 01:12.305
{\an5}(announcer)
And there's no coming back
from the damage that is done.

01:12.372 --> 01:13.907
{\an1}You trying to release
a sex tape with your girl?

01:13.973 --> 01:16.543
It was not in the public until
y'all brought it to life.

01:16.609 --> 01:18.845
(announcer)
No topic is off-limits.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.580
Moniece gay, so...

01:20.647 --> 01:22.348
(audience cheering)

01:22.415 --> 01:26.119
{\an5}(announcer)
And every second is
downright uncomfortable.

01:26.186 --> 01:29.122
{\an1}Don't ever in your life try
to doubt my (bleep) baby!

01:29.189 --> 01:31.624
You called my child ugly.

01:31.691 --> 01:34.461
Am I sorry? No, I'm not.
That would be a lie.

01:34.527 --> 01:37.964
{\an5}(announcer)
In Hollywood, you either
make it or break it.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.265
I just wanna fight
and get it over with.

01:39.332 --> 01:41.034
{\an5}(bleep) (bleep)!

01:39.332 --> 01:41.034
Get up!

01:41.100 --> 01:43.736
{\an5}(bleep)!

01:41.100 --> 01:43.736
All right, ladies, ladies!

01:43.803 --> 01:44.771
{\an1}What the (bleep)--
what're you gonna do?

01:44.838 --> 01:46.773
This is crazy.

01:52.078 --> 01:54.414

to confront each other.

02:17.003 --> 02:18.972
You know how this goes.

02:19.038 --> 02:20.673
The third season of
"Love and Hip Hop Hollywood"

02:20.740 --> 02:22.175
was exciting as ever.

02:22.242 --> 02:24.210
In addition to catching up
with some of our favorite

02:24.277 --> 02:25.578

02:27.480 --> 02:30.183

at some of hip hop's elite.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.404
from our
"Check Yourself" segments,

where a few cast members gave

03:27.640 --> 03:29.542
to scenes from this season.

03:29.609 --> 03:31.644
And we want you to join in

03:31.711 --> 03:35.081
{\an8}by using the hashtag

03:35.148 --> 03:36.516
{\an8}Welcome, everybody.

03:36.583 --> 03:39.085
{\an5}What up, though?

03:36.583 --> 03:39.085
{\an1}Hey.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.486
All right,
now first let me start

03:40.553 --> 03:43.089
by saying congratulations
to Ray J and Princess.

03:43.156 --> 03:44.324
(Ray J)
Thank you.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.692
Ray J, how's married life?
I see the ring.

03:45.758 --> 03:47.126
{\an7}Married life is great, you see
I got my house shoes on.

03:47.193 --> 03:49.862
{\an8}You got-- yeah!

03:49.929 --> 03:51.564
All right,
let's dive into this.

03:51.631 --> 03:54.734
{\an5}For three seasons,
the relationship between
Fizz and Moniece

03:54.801 --> 03:56.469
has remained a troubled one.

03:56.536 --> 03:58.171
So, when he moved
into Moniece's house,

03:58.237 --> 04:00.506
it was far
from a happy home.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.342
Let's take a look.

04:02.408 --> 04:05.878
{\an5}It's been a while
since I've had a man in the
house other than Cammy.

04:05.945 --> 04:08.448
A man like a daddy.

04:08.514 --> 04:10.583
{\an6}Psych?

04:08.514 --> 04:10.583
{\an1}(laughs)

04:10.650 --> 04:12.051
{\an5}(Fizz)
I know what y'all
are thinking,

04:12.118 --> 04:14.554
me living with Moniece
of all people.

04:14.621 --> 04:15.955
But trust me when I say

04:16.022 --> 04:18.391
this is definitely just
a temporary situation.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.493
One day a week is not
good enough for me.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.362
Do you want my, like, key?

04:22.428 --> 04:24.163
{\an5}I do, I want a key.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.163
Well, I want a key too.

04:24.230 --> 04:25.565
I wanna be able
to come in.

04:25.632 --> 04:29.569
No, let's-- let's hold off
on that for a minute.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.537
{\an1}Why, you got a girl living
with you or something?

04:31.604 --> 04:33.973
I haven't broken
the news to Nikki yet

04:34.040 --> 04:35.375
about me living
with Moniece,

04:35.441 --> 04:38.044
but when she actually
opens up and shows me

04:38.111 --> 04:39.579
that she's serious
about this relationship,

04:39.646 --> 04:41.047
then I'll do the same.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.483
You are, you know, moving on,
trying to figure things out,

04:43.549 --> 04:45.485
and being more serious.

04:45.551 --> 04:48.421
I'm just confused as to how you
could be serious with someone.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.189
Why is he living with me?

04:50.256 --> 04:51.557
(Nikki)
What the (bleep)?

04:51.624 --> 04:53.359
I would never let
another bitch see me sweat.

04:53.426 --> 04:55.161
But I will have
my words with Drew.

04:55.228 --> 04:58.831
{\an1}The only thing I want
from him is a vial of sperm.

04:58.898 --> 05:00.800
{\an5}That's for you and Moniece.

04:58.898 --> 05:00.800
I'm not with Moniece.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.301
{\an1}I have something else
for you too,

05:02.368 --> 05:03.870
{\an4}'cause Moniece told me
she wanna have another
kid with you.

05:03.936 --> 05:05.405
{\an3}Hah! No.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.040
{\an1}That's why I left you
this onesies.

05:07.106 --> 05:08.841
You should give her that.

05:08.908 --> 05:09.909
Get the (bleep)
outta here.

05:09.976 --> 05:13.079
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

05:13.146 --> 05:14.614
Fizz, let me
come to you first.

05:14.681 --> 05:16.315
When you-- you needed
a place to stay,

05:16.382 --> 05:18.451
you decided
to live with Moniece.

05:18.518 --> 05:20.119
It wasn't like I needed--
let's correct that.

05:20.186 --> 05:21.287
{\an1}Okay.

05:21.354 --> 05:22.555
{\an8}I could've easily went
and got a place.

05:22.622 --> 05:24.223
{\an8}I was trying to do
something different,

05:24.290 --> 05:25.692
{\an8}outside of the box
for my son.

05:25.758 --> 05:27.927
{\an1}Now, was there ever
a part of you that thought,

05:27.994 --> 05:30.763
{\an1}perhaps there could also be a
rekindling of the relationship?

05:30.830 --> 05:33.199
{\an5}No, no, there never
was a thought between
either one of us.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.701
{\an1}It's just completely
co-parenting at this point.

05:34.767 --> 05:35.868
{\an9}Yeah.

05:34.767 --> 05:35.868
{\an7}Okay.

05:35.935 --> 05:37.370
{\an9}Forever.

05:37.437 --> 05:39.572
{\an8}Now, Nikki, you found out
about this situation

05:39.639 --> 05:41.541
{\an8}through Moniece.

05:39.639 --> 05:41.541
{\an7}Right.

05:41.607 --> 05:43.943
{\an8}How did it make you feel
to hear from another party?

05:44.010 --> 05:45.912
That wouldn't've been
my way to go about it,

05:45.978 --> 05:47.513
but, you know,
it is what it is.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.082
I just would've preferred
to hear it from him.

05:49.148 --> 05:51.184
You seem you handled
the shock pretty well.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.986
{\an1}Oh, yeah, I'm never gonna
let nobody get under my skin.

05:54.053 --> 05:56.322
Okay, let me ask you
a question, Nia.

05:56.389 --> 05:58.825
Would you be okay with being
in a relationship with someone

05:58.891 --> 06:00.593
{\an5}who was living under
the same roof

06:00.660 --> 06:03.329
as the baby mother
or baby father?

06:03.396 --> 06:04.864
{\an8}No, I wouldn't be
okay with it.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.299
{\an8}Okay.

06:06.365 --> 06:07.567
{\an8}But Moniece and Fizz,

06:07.633 --> 06:09.402
{\an8}they a whole different
type of situation.

06:09.469 --> 06:11.003
(all laughing)

06:11.070 --> 06:12.605
Why is theirs unique?

06:12.672 --> 06:15.408
Moniece's gay, so...
I wouldn't be worried.

06:15.475 --> 06:17.243
She has a girlfriend.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.245
{\an5}I am bisexual.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.245
You're bisexual.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.013
{\an5}I love her girlfriend.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.013
Really?

06:21.080 --> 06:23.382
{\an4}My family has accepted her,
we're working on
getting pregnant.

06:23.449 --> 06:25.551
Uh, Fizz, are you
involved in this at all?

06:25.618 --> 06:26.886
No, I'm not.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.755
Okay, I know you said
you wanted his sperm.

06:28.821 --> 06:31.791
{\an1}We talked about it, but we're
taking a different route.

06:31.858 --> 06:33.159
Let's go back
a little bit, though,

06:33.226 --> 06:35.461
because you did mention
the donation of the sperm.

06:35.528 --> 06:36.696
{\an3}Yeah.

06:36.763 --> 06:38.498
Why did you talk to Nikki
about that

06:38.564 --> 06:39.899
before you really had

06:39.966 --> 06:41.634
{\an1}a sit-down conversation
with Fizz?

06:41.701 --> 06:45.972
{\an1}Nikki had mentioned to me
that my son, that I birthed,

06:46.038 --> 06:48.541
had been asking
for another sibling.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.109
{\an1}That definitely didn't
come from my mouth.

06:50.176 --> 06:51.410
'Cause me and him never
had that conversation.

06:51.477 --> 06:53.112
So, it was like, I don't
need another woman

06:53.179 --> 06:55.348
{\an1}to tell me what my son wants
'cause he has me all the time.

06:55.414 --> 06:56.983
{\an1}You're right, 'cause I'm not
the other woman who said that.

06:57.049 --> 06:58.351
I didn't even say that.

06:58.417 --> 06:59.685
Fizz, did you feel like
her blowing up about that

06:59.752 --> 07:01.354
was the end
of the relationship?

07:01.420 --> 07:04.123
It was never nothing.
It wasn't going anywhere.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.925
So, what was the purpose?

07:05.992 --> 07:08.060
{\an5}Did you--

07:05.992 --> 07:08.060
You know, actually,

07:08.127 --> 07:09.929
{\an1}before you all clap,
you know, I...

07:09.996 --> 07:13.099
(applause)

07:13.166 --> 07:14.901
Goddamn right!

07:14.967 --> 07:17.069
{\an1}All my good (bleep)
out here.

07:17.136 --> 07:18.971
{\an1}Okay, back to what
I was saying though,

07:19.038 --> 07:21.073
{\an1}before they started
acting ignorant,

07:21.140 --> 07:24.443
{\an4}uh, you know-- what?
What?

07:21.140 --> 07:24.443
{\an3}It's okay.

07:26.979 --> 07:28.481
{\an7}Bitch, you in
the (bleep) crowd.

07:28.548 --> 07:29.782
{\an8}Shut the (bleep) up.

07:29.849 --> 07:32.351
{\an7}Stop talking, stop talking.
You an extra, boo-boo.

07:32.418 --> 07:34.253
{\an7}Be quiet,
get the bitch out--

07:34.320 --> 07:36.889
{\an7}You got your two seconds
to shine, congratulations.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.692
{\an1}Did you get a check
for coming today?

07:39.759 --> 07:41.928
{\an5}Ooh!

07:39.759 --> 07:41.928
Get out of here, bitch.

07:41.994 --> 07:43.095
What was it
after that situation

07:43.162 --> 07:44.230
that made you
completely move on?

07:44.297 --> 07:45.865
{\an1}We just kinda
didn't really talk.

07:45.932 --> 07:47.633
{\an1}I don't care for her,
so it's like,

07:47.700 --> 07:49.302
{\an1}I don't really need to be
in a situation

07:49.368 --> 07:51.537
{\an1}when I don't wanna
make myself uncomfortable.

07:51.604 --> 07:52.905
Where do you two
stand right now?

07:52.972 --> 07:55.074
Like I had told you, I was
going through my own thing,

07:55.141 --> 07:57.109
{\an1}so I won't put everything on
him, you know what I'm saying?

07:57.176 --> 07:59.445
But just don't speak on me in
interviews and do all of that.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.214
{\an3}Oh!

08:01.280 --> 08:03.049
{\an1}I don't know what interview
she's talking about.

08:03.115 --> 08:04.984
{\an1}I would love to know what
interview she's talking about.

08:05.051 --> 08:06.586
{\an1}Okay, it was a video,
and a lot of people was

08:06.652 --> 08:08.521
{\an1}tagging me in it,
and you know,

08:08.588 --> 08:10.456
I just felt like it was
a little uncalled for.

08:10.523 --> 08:11.524
Like, why you gossiping?

08:11.591 --> 08:12.592
Like, I'm not even
talking about you,

08:12.658 --> 08:14.460
{\an1}so why are you
talking about me?

08:14.527 --> 08:16.395
On your opinion, do you feel
like you're okay with Nikki?

08:16.462 --> 08:17.563
She's saying in an interview
she thought you guys were okay.

08:17.630 --> 08:18.898
I don't know where
all this is coming from,

08:18.965 --> 08:20.666
I wasn't speaking
on Nikki, at all.

08:20.733 --> 08:21.868
I never speak on Nikki.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.669
Nikki's the one
talking about me.

08:23.736 --> 08:25.504
{\an4}Desperate for fame,
that nobody should
take me serious,

08:25.571 --> 08:27.039
including Safaree.

08:27.106 --> 08:28.507
I felt like she wanted
a relationship

08:28.574 --> 08:29.809
for three episodes,
and then she--

08:29.876 --> 08:31.244
But why are you mad,
because I-- I did it

08:31.310 --> 08:32.879
{\an1}bigger than a lot
of these people on here,

08:32.945 --> 08:34.580
{\an4}who supposedly have
music careers--

08:32.945 --> 08:34.580
{\an3}No!

08:34.647 --> 08:36.082
{\an4}Because--

08:34.647 --> 08:36.082
I'm not mad at you at all.

08:36.148 --> 08:38.217
{\an5}I keep it very cool.

08:36.148 --> 08:38.217
But you mad at me because--

08:38.284 --> 08:39.518
We got a compilation.

08:39.585 --> 08:40.586
{\an1}We got a compilation
coming out, it's dope.

08:40.653 --> 08:41.988
It's real dope.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.422
But I did it right,
people are checking for me.

08:43.489 --> 08:44.757
And nobody's checking
for you.

08:44.824 --> 08:46.392
Checking to see what
(bleep) you sitting on.

08:46.459 --> 08:48.661
{\an5}(audience oh's)

08:46.459 --> 08:48.661
Really? Oh, really?

08:48.728 --> 08:49.896
{\an1}Oh, really, what (bleep)
I'm sitting on?

08:49.962 --> 08:52.832
{\an1}Because if I wanted you
or any (bleep) here--

08:52.899 --> 08:55.768
{\an5}You had me... bye!

08:52.899 --> 08:55.768
Yeah, and I didn't want you.

08:55.835 --> 08:56.836
{\an1}But I'm the only bitch
who did it right.

08:56.903 --> 08:58.070
And that pissed off--

08:58.137 --> 08:59.739
Did what?
The plastic surgery?

08:59.805 --> 09:01.140
{\an5}What plastic surgery?

08:59.805 --> 09:01.140
Fizz!

09:01.207 --> 09:02.508
I'm trying to figure out
what you got.

09:02.575 --> 09:03.876
What talent
you really got?

09:03.943 --> 09:05.411
{\an1}My bank account is bigger
than a lot of these (bleep),

09:05.478 --> 09:06.545
including you.

09:06.612 --> 09:08.614
{\an1}That's why you sleeping
on her couch.

09:08.681 --> 09:10.783
My baby mama had three
bedrooms, I had my own room.

09:10.850 --> 09:13.619
{\an5}That's great.

09:10.850 --> 09:13.619
(laughter)

09:13.686 --> 09:15.087
Congratulations.

09:15.154 --> 09:17.456
All right, well, we're
gonna move on from that,

09:17.523 --> 09:20.359
and hopefully this kind of
calms down a little bit later.

09:20.426 --> 09:22.495
Well, Fizz and Nikki
aren't the only ones

09:22.561 --> 09:24.063
who ended this season
on a sour note.

09:24.130 --> 09:26.465
Moniece had some unresolved
issues of her own.

09:26.532 --> 09:27.934
Let's take a look.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.404
The last person I want to
spend a relaxing day with

09:31.470 --> 09:32.805
is "Ho-niece."

09:32.872 --> 09:33.873
You don't know me.

09:33.940 --> 09:36.108
But you judge
by delusion!

09:36.175 --> 09:38.377
Don't raise my (bleep).
I can (bleep) you, honey.

09:38.444 --> 09:40.313
{\an5}(bleep) you.

09:38.444 --> 09:40.313
(bleep) you, bitch.

09:40.379 --> 09:42.848
{\an4}You like to sit here
and attack people
from behind your computer

09:42.915 --> 09:44.083
{\an1}like you some type
of Twitter thug?

09:44.150 --> 09:47.153
{\an1}(bleep) you, don't think
that it's over, bitch.

09:47.219 --> 09:49.555
(stools clattering)

09:49.622 --> 09:52.325
(Moniece)
Princess and Brandi,

09:52.391 --> 09:55.795
I wanted to share the tea.

09:55.861 --> 09:58.064
Brandi went looking
for her husband,

09:58.130 --> 10:01.100
and then she attacked Becky,
and then she was arrested.

10:01.167 --> 10:04.770
(shouting)

10:04.837 --> 10:07.306
{\an1}Now we got a problem, bitch.
Now we got a problem.

10:07.373 --> 10:09.175
You got the story
so wrong.

10:09.241 --> 10:11.577
Blessings to you all.

10:11.644 --> 10:14.613
(applause)

10:14.680 --> 10:16.782
{\an5}(Nina)
All right, Moniece,
let me start with you.

10:16.849 --> 10:19.986
Why does it seem like a lot
of the women come for you?

10:20.052 --> 10:22.421
What it really
boils down to is,

10:22.488 --> 10:26.592
last year, if everyone had
just kept their mouth shut,

10:26.659 --> 10:30.930
then none of this would've
ever even come about.

10:30.997 --> 10:33.666
Their go-to is
my motherhood,

10:33.733 --> 10:35.901
and you open up
the can of worms,

10:35.968 --> 10:37.636
you open up
the Pandora's Box,

10:37.703 --> 10:40.406
{\an5}and you don't know
what the (bleep)
might pop out of it.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.742
{\an4}A bunch of (bleep),
a bunch of lies.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.742
{\an3}Shh.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.310
Let me ask
a question, Brandi?

10:44.377 --> 10:46.479
Pandora's Box is
a (bleep) fraud.

10:46.545 --> 10:48.447
{\an7}A bunch of (bleep),
that's what popped out.

10:48.514 --> 10:49.882
{\an7}You don't (bleep) speak
on people's life

10:49.949 --> 10:51.217
{\an8}when you wanna
speak on lies.

10:51.283 --> 10:52.651
But you spoke on mine.

10:52.718 --> 10:55.721
{\an1}No, I speak on truth.
You spoke (bleep) (bleep).

10:55.788 --> 10:58.057
{\an5}Let me ask you a question.

10:55.788 --> 10:58.057
{\an1}Don't lie on me
or my family.

10:58.124 --> 11:00.493
{\an5}But that was my life.

10:58.124 --> 11:00.493
That's where you leave
all the whole argument.

11:00.559 --> 11:02.261
{\an5}But you spoke--

11:00.559 --> 11:02.261
Brandi, let me ask you
a question.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.963
{\an5}She's trying to ask you
a question.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.963
I'm sorry, Nina.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.364
Let's go back to last year,

11:05.431 --> 11:07.900
where Moniece felt that
her motherhood was attacked.

11:07.967 --> 11:09.969
Do you feel, at that time,
you were wrong?

11:10.036 --> 11:12.038
No, I do not, I have
every right to speak

11:12.104 --> 11:13.906
{\an1}on something
I'm passionate about.

11:13.973 --> 11:16.442
{\an1}My child, my son,
my experience.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.011
But when the behavior
is reciprocated,

11:19.078 --> 11:21.814
then "I'm a victim,"
then "I'm this-- "

11:21.881 --> 11:23.149
{\an4}(Nikki)
Moniece, you play
the victim a lot.

11:23.215 --> 11:24.950
That I'm the third--

11:25.017 --> 11:26.886
{\an4}She goes out of her way to
play the victim, I know
this firsthand for myself.

11:26.952 --> 11:30.790
Nikki, you said that you feel
that she plays the victim?

11:30.856 --> 11:31.957
When I hear
interviews about me

11:32.024 --> 11:33.559
or her re-tweeting
negative stuff.

11:33.626 --> 11:36.095
{\an1}You sitting here, talking
negative about me for what?

11:36.162 --> 11:38.364
You try to bully people
and play this victim.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.800
{\an1}I don't even think about you
for one second of my day.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.002
You slid in Safaree's DMs--

11:43.069 --> 11:44.537
(audience oh's)

11:44.603 --> 11:46.305
You didn't? You didn't?

11:46.372 --> 11:47.640
Safaree, did she not
slide into your DMs?

11:47.706 --> 11:48.808
{\an4}For work?

11:47.706 --> 11:48.808
{\an3}For work?

11:48.874 --> 11:50.810
Wait a minute.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.979
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.915
You think Safaree's
gonna work with you?

11:55.981 --> 11:57.817
{\an1}I sent Safaree
a clip of my record

11:57.883 --> 11:59.251
{\an1}and said I would love
to work with him.

11:59.318 --> 12:00.820
{\an1}It was definitely
about business.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.121
Safaree, clear that up.

12:02.188 --> 12:05.357
{\an7}It was-- it was a--
a working, um...

12:05.424 --> 12:08.160
{\an8}it was like-- nah,
it was about work.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.629
{\an5}Okay--

12:08.227 --> 12:10.629
Did I not send you
a clip of my video?

12:10.696 --> 12:12.164
Masika, what do you
have to say?

12:12.231 --> 12:13.532
{\an8}I don't agree
with everybody
ganging up on her--

12:13.599 --> 12:15.668
{\an7}I'm not ganging up,
this is not--

12:15.734 --> 12:17.770
All right, ladies,
ladies, one at a time.

12:17.837 --> 12:20.806
(overlapping shouting)

12:20.873 --> 12:22.641
{\an1}You're trash, I would never
talk about your child.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.143
I cannot compete with
your widescreen mouth.

12:24.210 --> 12:25.377
I just can't do it.

12:25.444 --> 12:26.779
{\an4}(bleep)!

12:25.444 --> 12:26.779
I can't do it.

12:26.846 --> 12:28.481
It's-- it's
the high-pitched squeak.

12:28.547 --> 12:29.748
{\an1}I know, because
I think you're pathetic

12:29.815 --> 12:30.883
{\an1}'cause you play
like you above (bleep).

12:30.950 --> 12:31.884
It's the high-pitched
squeak.

12:31.951 --> 12:33.285
But you came up
with this girl

12:33.352 --> 12:34.620
{\an4}and do messy (bleep),
you are just
as messy, shut up.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.589
Make your mouth
a little smaller.

12:36.655 --> 12:38.057
{\an5}No, I cannot.

12:36.655 --> 12:38.057
Make it a little smaller.

12:38.124 --> 12:39.492
{\an5}Because yours is
so goddamn big.

12:38.124 --> 12:39.492
And then talk.

12:39.558 --> 12:41.360
{\an5}Shut the (bleep) up.

12:39.558 --> 12:41.360
Oh, okay, like I was saying.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.862
{\an5}Go ahead.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.862
I don't agree with
everybody ganging up

12:42.928 --> 12:43.996
and then calling her
a victim.

12:44.063 --> 12:45.664
{\an4}Ganging up?
Wait-wait-wait-wait.

12:44.063 --> 12:45.664
{\an3}Yes.

12:45.731 --> 12:48.968
(overlapping shouting)

12:49.034 --> 12:52.338
{\an1}Her and her talking
about my child!

12:52.404 --> 12:54.206
{\an1}'Cause you talking
about my child!

12:54.273 --> 12:56.976
You can shut
the (bleep) up!

12:57.042 --> 12:59.011
{\an8}You're a punk-ass bitch.

12:59.078 --> 13:00.446
{\an8}Close that
wide-ass mouth.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.614
{\an7}Hey!

13:01.680 --> 13:02.882
{\an8}Calling your son ugly.
Am I sorry?

13:02.948 --> 13:04.483
{\an8}No, I'm not,
that would be a lie.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.552
{\an7}Don't say nothing
about my child.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.455
{\an7}It was not in the public until
y'all brought it to light.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.656
{\an8}Wait, wait, wait,
(bleep) all that (bleep).

13:10.723 --> 13:12.191
{\an8}What are you gonna do?

13:12.258 --> 13:14.627
{\an7}That isn't her nose
or her body or her cheeks

13:14.693 --> 13:16.562
{\an7}or her chin or her butt
or her boobs

13:16.629 --> 13:18.297
{\an8}or her hair-- anything.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.071
First of all, shut up!

13:26.138 --> 13:28.073
'Cause you talked
about my child,

13:28.140 --> 13:29.742
so you can
shut the (bleep) up.

13:29.808 --> 13:31.510
How about that?
(bleep)!

13:31.577 --> 13:33.179
{\an8}Sit down,
megaphone-mouth.

13:33.245 --> 13:34.747
(overlapping chatter)

13:34.813 --> 13:36.048
{\an1}You're talking about
somebody's (bleep) child.

13:36.115 --> 13:37.616
You (bleep) hatin'.

13:37.683 --> 13:38.851
(overlapping chatter)

13:38.918 --> 13:41.754
{\an1}Stupid-looking
black lace

13:41.820 --> 13:44.256
Elvira-looking bitch that
talks about people's kids.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.724
You do it too, bitch.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.826
'Cause you put on Twitter
something about my child.

13:47.893 --> 13:50.629
Everybody, we really wanna
hear from everyone.

13:50.696 --> 13:52.464
But we just can't
with you yelling.

13:52.531 --> 13:55.067
{\an8}Brandi, I'm gonna give you
an opportunity to respond.

13:55.134 --> 13:59.138
I-- apparently there was
a comment made about your son.

13:59.205 --> 14:00.606
Can you please respond?

14:00.673 --> 14:03.876
{\an8}You called my child ugly,

14:03.943 --> 14:06.045
{\an8}and you called
my family ugly.

14:06.111 --> 14:08.881
{\an1}You said that
we needed to save money

14:08.948 --> 14:11.584
{\an1}for my two-year-old
toddler's braces.

14:11.650 --> 14:14.753
{\an6}And said--

14:11.650 --> 14:14.753
{\an1}Shut up,
shut the (bleep) up!

14:14.820 --> 14:16.589
{\an8}You shut the (bleep) up!

14:16.655 --> 14:19.058
{\an1}Because you have no right
to say nothing

14:19.124 --> 14:21.026
{\an1}about my child--
Shut up!

14:21.093 --> 14:22.595
We have to do
one at a time, you guys.

14:22.661 --> 14:23.862
Be adults.

14:23.929 --> 14:25.464
{\an1}(bleep),
what're you gonna do?

14:25.531 --> 14:28.434
{\an5}Close that wide-ass mouth--

14:25.531 --> 14:28.434
Hey, shut up.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.202
She not gonna tell me
to shut the (bleep) up.

14:30.269 --> 14:31.570
{\an1}Talk about people
and try to act like

14:31.637 --> 14:33.038
you are unembarrassed,
that's what it's like,

14:33.105 --> 14:35.474
but you don't wanna hear
what somebody gotta say

14:35.541 --> 14:37.076
{\an1}when you talk
about their child!

14:37.142 --> 14:39.078
Masika! Is she saying
you were saying that, or...

14:39.144 --> 14:41.714
{\an5}No, no, I told her,
instead of stealing
for her son,

14:41.780 --> 14:42.715
she should save
for braces.

14:42.781 --> 14:44.450
No, you-- shut up.

14:44.516 --> 14:46.585
Bitch, don't worry about
our son, how about that?

14:46.652 --> 14:48.153
We're gonna switch gears,
we're gonna switch gears.

14:48.220 --> 14:51.190
{\an7}We gotta keep it moving,
this is too much.

14:51.257 --> 14:52.758
All right, Teairra,
let me ask you a question.

14:52.825 --> 14:56.428
There's a lot of people
talking to Moniece right now.

14:56.495 --> 14:58.631
Do you feel like
she's being ganged up on?

14:58.697 --> 14:59.632
Absolutely. Yeah.

14:59.698 --> 15:01.700
{\an8}I mean, but we're all grown.

15:01.767 --> 15:03.902
We can have one-on-one
conversations.

15:03.969 --> 15:06.472
You know, I can talk
to you, I can talk to you,

15:06.538 --> 15:09.375
{\an5}but I don't need
all y'all coming at me
at the same damn time.

15:09.441 --> 15:11.677
{\an5}And then call me a victim.

15:09.441 --> 15:11.677
(applause)

15:11.744 --> 15:13.979
{\an1}You said
it's not cool at all,

15:14.046 --> 15:16.215
{\an1}and you understand when
she spoke about my child.

15:16.282 --> 15:17.783
Absolutely, she shouldn't
have said that.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.852
That was wrong
as (bleep), okay?

15:19.918 --> 15:21.487
{\an7}(Jason)
I'm surprised at
all the women that think

15:21.553 --> 15:22.688
{\an7}that what she did is
appropriate.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.523
{\an6}What?!

15:22.755 --> 15:24.523
Who said--

15:24.590 --> 15:26.425
(overlapping shouts)

15:26.492 --> 15:28.160
I said that to you,
like, seven times.

15:28.227 --> 15:29.928
{\an5}(Moniece)
If you want me to address
calling your son ugly--

15:29.995 --> 15:32.998
{\an8}Am I sorry? No, I'm not,
that would be a lie.

15:33.065 --> 15:35.901
But, no, I should not
have said it publicly.

15:35.968 --> 15:37.903
{\an1}They so lucky that
God is in me right now,

15:37.970 --> 15:39.371
{\an1}'cause I'mma
leave it at that.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.240
{\an5}(Nina)
All right, you know what?
Time to move on.

15:41.307 --> 15:42.708
A sex tape
in the wrong hands

15:42.775 --> 15:45.110
can cause quite a stir
around town.

15:45.177 --> 15:47.479
So, when word got around
that Moniece was getting caught

15:47.546 --> 15:49.281
hot and heavy
in front of the camera,

15:49.348 --> 15:51.417
the news spread
like wildfire.

15:51.483 --> 15:52.751
I'm done,
I'm leaving.

15:52.818 --> 15:54.053
{\an5}You're leaving?

15:52.818 --> 15:54.053
I'll see them in court.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.888
Moniece, please don't leave.

15:55.954 --> 15:57.089
I'm met up with Jason Lee.

15:57.156 --> 16:00.059
He basically told me
he knows someone who has

16:00.125 --> 16:01.560
a sex tape of Moniece.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.930
{\an1}Oh, my-- it's the receipt
that we need.

16:04.997 --> 16:06.899
{\an5}(Moniece)
I'm not sitting here
for that clip.

16:06.965 --> 16:08.233
Oh, my God.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.836
Oh! No wonder you can't
keep it (bleep).

16:10.903 --> 16:12.571
Eww, she has
a hairy butthole.

16:12.638 --> 16:15.841
{\an1}Oh, my God, it is
(bleep) funny-looking.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.209
Yo, this is corny.

16:17.276 --> 16:18.444
{\an5}What you so angry for?

16:17.276 --> 16:18.444
It's whack.

16:18.510 --> 16:19.845
(bleep) Moniece.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.547
{\an1}I'mma just let you
know what's up.

16:21.613 --> 16:24.950
Jason came to us with
this (bleep) sex tape.

16:25.017 --> 16:27.986
{\an3}Psssh.

16:28.053 --> 16:29.688
{\an1}I just wanted
to give you heads-up.

16:29.755 --> 16:32.291
{\an4}I realize it was too much,
and it just really
needed to stop.

16:32.358 --> 16:34.793
{\an1}I actually had
a conversation with Max.

16:34.860 --> 16:36.829
Supposedly there's a tape
out here floating around

16:36.895 --> 16:38.197
with you in it.

16:38.263 --> 16:41.767
A sex tape.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.235
{\an1}Don't act like
a (bleep) victim.

16:43.302 --> 16:45.571
{\an1}You throw a rock, you gonna
get a rock thrown at you.

16:45.637 --> 16:47.139
I do not consent

16:47.206 --> 16:50.109
to the dissemination
of this tape.

16:50.175 --> 16:53.812
And I will have
my attorney reach out.

16:53.879 --> 16:56.382
Brandi, let me
ask you a question.

16:56.448 --> 16:58.250
I know that you were
upset about what she said

16:58.317 --> 16:59.818
about you onstage,
so you retaliated

16:59.885 --> 17:03.021
by possibly releasing
some type of sex tape.

17:03.088 --> 17:04.857
{\an5}I wanna be clear here.

17:03.088 --> 17:04.857
Okay.

17:04.923 --> 17:06.925
{\an1}The sex tape that you guys
are talking about,

17:06.992 --> 17:09.395
{\an1}didn't no one say, "Oh,
we are gonna ruin your life--"

17:09.461 --> 17:10.796
Thank you for joining us,
Moniece.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.098
{\an1}And going out of our way
to make this chick--

17:13.165 --> 17:14.566
You just did, though.

17:14.633 --> 17:15.834
You just posted
on Instagram...

17:15.901 --> 17:16.902
{\an7}You did dirt,
it's out there,

17:16.969 --> 17:18.237
{\an7}deal with it,
own your (bleep).

17:18.303 --> 17:21.839
{\an8}That tape is not out.

17:18.303 --> 17:21.839
{\an8}We-- it's not out.

17:21.906 --> 17:24.276
{\an5}Moniece, let me go
to you for a second.

17:21.906 --> 17:24.276
{\an1}My God.

17:24.343 --> 17:26.878
{\an5}When you initially
decided to talk about
Brandi's court case,

17:26.944 --> 17:28.947
you had to imagine that
they would retaliate back

17:29.014 --> 17:30.716
from what happened
at that night.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.385
I really have, like,
nothing to say, honestly,

17:33.452 --> 17:35.754
so let's just
go down the line.

17:35.821 --> 17:37.189
{\an8}In the very beginning...

17:35.821 --> 17:37.189
{\an8}(bleep) outta here.

17:37.256 --> 17:38.590
{\an8}I tried to have
conversations

17:38.657 --> 17:40.159
{\an8}with each person
individually.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.694
{\an5}Okay.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.694
By starting with Brandi.

17:42.761 --> 17:44.663
In that same
conversation,

17:44.730 --> 17:46.198
the mommies and
mimosas brunch,

17:46.265 --> 17:49.301
I started off by saying
I wholeheartedly,

17:49.368 --> 17:53.639
{\an5}sincerely apologize
if you misinterpreted,
misunderstood--

17:53.705 --> 17:55.274
She ain't doing (bleep).

17:55.340 --> 17:56.742
To me, that was
a dead issue.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.243
{\an5}I tried to have
a conversation
with Princess.

17:58.310 --> 17:59.478
Too late!

17:59.545 --> 18:01.346
The conversation
actually ended with us

18:01.413 --> 18:04.116
having a mutual
understanding.

18:04.183 --> 18:07.119
{\an7}Actually, I told you we could
just meet at the park

18:07.186 --> 18:08.921
{\an7}after the scene, and you
didn't wanna do that.

18:08.987 --> 18:11.123
{\an5}We are not children.

18:08.987 --> 18:11.123
She won't, she won't.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.091
I'm not going
to meet you in a park.

18:13.158 --> 18:15.561
{\an4}'Cause you're
a punk-ass bitch.

18:13.158 --> 18:15.561
We're not in junior high.

18:15.627 --> 18:17.629
I didn't go and put
her sex tape out.

18:17.696 --> 18:19.565
At least I know
who was in the video.

18:19.631 --> 18:21.066
You didn't even know
who was in your video.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.802
So-- I didn't even know
the video existed.

18:23.869 --> 18:26.205
{\an4}If she's upset that
I got some information
that I shared,

18:26.271 --> 18:27.606
{\an1}let's go to court,
I got money.

18:27.673 --> 18:29.074
{\an1}Why did you share it
with anyone other than her?

18:29.141 --> 18:30.809
Because I'm a blogger,
and I share it with the world.

18:30.876 --> 18:32.811
{\an5}Did she share it
with everybody
other than us?

18:32.878 --> 18:35.113
{\an8}But it's something
that was about her.

18:35.180 --> 18:36.515
{\an8}It's a video.

18:35.180 --> 18:36.515
{\an8}But she-- wait!

18:36.582 --> 18:37.749
{\an8}And it's all out there.

18:36.582 --> 18:37.749
{\an8}But wait, but--

18:37.816 --> 18:39.151
{\an8}Not talking to you, Brandi.

18:39.218 --> 18:40.652
{\an8}It was not in the public
until y'all brought it to light.

18:40.719 --> 18:43.388
No, wait-wait-wait,
(bleep) all that (bleep).

18:43.455 --> 18:45.023
{\an1}We tried to release
a sex tape with your girl?

18:45.090 --> 18:46.125
(Fizz)
I didn't say that.

18:46.191 --> 18:48.160
That's what you just said.

18:48.227 --> 18:49.461
{\an1}You keep saying that,
I didn't say that.

18:49.528 --> 18:51.196
Don't put the words
in my mouth, bruh.

18:51.263 --> 18:52.831
{\an5}No, you did just say that--

18:51.263 --> 18:52.831
I did not say (bleep)!

18:52.898 --> 18:54.066
I said y'all brought it
to the light.

18:54.132 --> 18:55.601
{\an5}I did not bring (bleep)--

18:54.132 --> 18:55.601
I said y'all.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.436
Did I point the finger?
I said y'all.

18:57.503 --> 19:00.072
{\an1}I ain't part of y'all
though, my (bleep).

19:00.138 --> 19:01.406
Y'all was all
in the scene, bro.

19:01.473 --> 19:03.108
That's all I'm saying.

19:03.175 --> 19:04.409
{\an1}Then why the (bleep) was
I named in that?

19:04.476 --> 19:05.644
And I said you was
the one that deaded it,

19:05.711 --> 19:06.778
so why you keep
bringing that up?

19:06.845 --> 19:08.347
(overlapping shouting)

19:08.413 --> 19:09.815
You making it funny.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.950
You guys,
one at a time, please.

19:12.017 --> 19:13.519
You're all adults
with children.

19:13.585 --> 19:15.354
{\an8}Seriously, first of all.

19:13.585 --> 19:15.354
{\an8}And I don't know

19:15.420 --> 19:18.624
{\an8}when you decide that this isn't
worth them seeing this later,

19:18.690 --> 19:21.293
{\an5}but I do know
that if it definitely
continues this way,

19:21.360 --> 19:22.561
it's not gonna
end well for anybody.

19:22.628 --> 19:24.463
What's done is done,
like--

19:24.530 --> 19:26.532
{\an5}So, you have no interest
in calling a truce
or sitting down--

19:26.598 --> 19:27.833
I just wanna fight
and get it over with.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.536
{\an5}So, you wanna fight?

19:27.900 --> 19:30.536
Yeah.

19:30.602 --> 19:33.672
{\an8}Princess is crazy.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.707
Max and Brandi,
any type of--

19:35.774 --> 19:37.276
{\an1}Nah, I just think it's funny
how people sit here

19:37.342 --> 19:39.344
and try to be cordial

19:39.411 --> 19:40.579
and act like it was their
family being (bleep) with.

19:40.646 --> 19:42.514
{\an1}But they would be cool--
that's not the case.

19:42.581 --> 19:44.116
{\an4}(bleep), you'd turn
the (bleep) up if somebody
(bleep) with Cam.

19:44.182 --> 19:46.785
{\an5}I said, if they
harm my son,
I would turn up.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.820
If they talk (bleep),
they talk (bleep).

19:48.887 --> 19:50.022
{\an1}If they talk (bleep) harm,
it's a problem, though.

19:50.088 --> 19:51.523
{\an6}To you.

19:50.088 --> 19:51.523
{\an1}That's how
I got brought up.

19:51.590 --> 19:53.458
{\an5}To you, you asked
the question,
I answered it.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.027
{\an5}Max--

19:53.525 --> 19:55.027
{\an1}You full of (bleep),
y'all fake as (bleep).

19:55.093 --> 19:56.595
{\an4}Y'all start (bleep),
y'all talk (bleep),
y'all don't fight.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.664
{\an5}Your wife started it though.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.664
You ain't got nobodies.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.198
{\an5}You ain't doing (bleep).

19:58.730 --> 20:00.198
Your wife started it.

20:00.265 --> 20:02.601
Y'all ain't got no goods.
You're not doing nothing.

20:02.668 --> 20:05.170
This isn't going anywhere,
so we're gonna go ahead

20:05.237 --> 20:07.706
and take a break,
we'll be right back

20:07.773 --> 20:10.042
on "Love and Hip Hop
Hollywood: The Reunion."

20:10.108 --> 20:12.044
(cheering and applause)

20:15.147 --> 20:17.516
I told myself that I would
fight with my words,

20:17.583 --> 20:18.951
and that's what I did.

20:19.017 --> 20:21.520
I will never again let
someone get to me like that

20:21.587 --> 20:23.221
to where I want
to attack 'em.

20:23.288 --> 20:25.924
Even though sometimes
I really want to.

20:25.991 --> 20:28.226
{\an1}I'm tired of people (bleep)
running their wide-ass mouths

20:28.293 --> 20:29.761
and not letting anyone talk.

20:29.828 --> 20:32.598
All of this... is not
gonna stop other people

20:32.664 --> 20:34.433
from saying what
you've actually done.

20:34.499 --> 20:36.802
{\an8}Were you invited at one time
to the wedding?

20:36.868 --> 20:38.203
{\an7}No.

20:38.270 --> 20:40.172
{\an8}I haven't talked to her
in, like, two years.

20:40.238 --> 20:42.374
{\an8}I was wrong.

20:40.238 --> 20:42.374
{\an8}Dirty and underhanded.

20:42.441 --> 20:45.277
{\an8}It was the way I reacted.

20:42.441 --> 20:45.277
{\an8}(audience reacting)

20:52.317 --> 20:54.786
You can't call
nobody's child ugly

20:54.853 --> 20:56.555
and think that somebody
gonna sit up there

20:56.622 --> 20:59.391
and support you, that's just--
to me, it's foul.

20:59.458 --> 21:01.994
I don't have anything
to say to anybody.

21:02.060 --> 21:04.529
{\an1}It's been a three-year
gang bang, and at this point,

21:04.596 --> 21:06.231
I'm kind of tired.
I'm burnt out.

21:06.298 --> 21:09.101
It's pretty ridiculous.

21:09.167 --> 21:11.703
(cheering and applause)

21:11.770 --> 21:14.473
{\an5}(Nina)
Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood: The Reunion."

21:14.539 --> 21:17.342
{\an5}Okay, now it's time to talk
about one of the happier moments
of the season.

21:17.409 --> 21:20.412
{\an8}Putting together a royal affair
is no easy task,

21:20.479 --> 21:22.147
{\an8}especially when the bride-to-be

21:22.214 --> 21:24.316
finds herself
at the mercy of a groom

21:24.383 --> 21:26.385
who wants no part
in the planning.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.386
Let's take a look.

21:27.452 --> 21:28.820
I need you
to help me.

21:28.887 --> 21:30.055
Let me ask you something.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.124
When you turn on
the Scoot-E-Bike, right,

21:32.190 --> 21:33.992
should it have
this sound?

21:34.059 --> 21:35.894
<i>Scoot-E-Bike,</i>
<i>by Raytroniks.</i>

21:35.961 --> 21:38.030
That's too low, huh?

21:38.096 --> 21:40.465
Ha ha!
Look who it is!

21:40.532 --> 21:41.600
Why are you here?

21:41.667 --> 21:42.701
I got a surprise
for you.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.105
{\an7}(Ray J)
I told y'all
I was a good person.

21:47.172 --> 21:48.507
{\an8}Look who's here.

21:48.573 --> 21:49.841
{\an7}(crying)
Grammy!

21:52.678 --> 21:54.746
{\an5}(Ray J)
I know it's been a lot
of ups and downs

21:54.813 --> 21:56.515
with Princess and her family,

21:56.581 --> 21:58.917
but that don't mean that
the real people that love her

21:58.984 --> 22:00.852
shouldn't be in her life.

22:00.919 --> 22:02.721
(Princess crying)

22:04.423 --> 22:05.657
Hey, sweetie.

22:05.724 --> 22:06.725
(crying)

22:07.893 --> 22:09.961
{\an7}I just wanted
to start off new.

22:10.028 --> 22:11.563
{\an7}Promise?

22:10.028 --> 22:11.563
{\an9}Mm-hmm.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.732
All right, sweetheart.

22:13.799 --> 22:15.934
(cheering and applause)

22:17.302 --> 22:18.670
(Nina)
Now, Princess, at one point,

22:18.737 --> 22:20.038
I know you're were
getting very emotional.

22:20.105 --> 22:21.940
I know it's difficult
to see that.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.075
{\an5}But...

22:22.007 --> 22:23.075
It's okay, baby.

22:23.141 --> 22:26.278
I'm glad that it
was a happy ending.

22:26.344 --> 22:29.047
{\an5}I know that you said
that there had been
almost ten years

22:29.114 --> 22:31.149
since you had spoken
to your dad at one point.

22:31.216 --> 22:32.517
{\an8}Yeah. Not like we
have any issues.

22:32.584 --> 22:34.186
{\an8}We just don't
call each other.

22:34.252 --> 22:36.188
{\an8}I don't call him,
he doesn't call me.

22:36.254 --> 22:37.389
{\an1}But they talk now,
though.

22:37.456 --> 22:39.091
Yeah, we've been
out there to visit.

22:39.157 --> 22:40.392
{\an5}Oh, really?

22:39.157 --> 22:40.392
So...

22:40.459 --> 22:42.527
(applause)

22:42.594 --> 22:44.763
{\an5}(Nina)
It looked like a really
well-planned wedding.

22:44.830 --> 22:49.134
How much, percentage-wise,
did you plan versus Ray?

22:49.201 --> 22:51.369
I think I planned
like 90%.

22:51.436 --> 22:53.004
(laughter)

22:53.071 --> 22:54.106
{\an8}You let her just--

22:54.172 --> 22:56.007
{\an8}No, I tried to put
the 25% in,

22:56.074 --> 22:57.175
and it was too much--

22:57.242 --> 22:58.510
Oh, so you just
garnished the wedding.

22:58.577 --> 23:00.679
Well, I was going over
the top with my ideas.

23:00.746 --> 23:02.147
{\an1}'Cause he said,
"Coming to America,"

23:02.214 --> 23:04.015
{\an1}and then the lady had
giraffes on the the table.

23:04.082 --> 23:06.785
{\an5}I just wanted
to wear the chain that
Arsenio Hall had on,

23:06.852 --> 23:09.187
not Eddie Murphy,
you know what I'm saying?

23:09.254 --> 23:10.722
Sounds about right.

23:10.789 --> 23:13.959
Now, while Princess may have
had a more distant relationship

23:14.025 --> 23:16.461
with her family,
Ray's was never too far away.

23:16.528 --> 23:18.163
His "momager,"
Sonja Norwood,

23:18.230 --> 23:21.333
was almost too close
for Princess's comfort.

23:21.399 --> 23:22.901
Let's take a look.

23:22.968 --> 23:25.637
{\an1}I'm bringing you
an agreement.

23:25.704 --> 23:26.872
This is prenup.

23:26.938 --> 23:29.207
I don't wanna
make her mad.

23:29.274 --> 23:32.477
There will be a prenup.

23:32.544 --> 23:34.613
{\an8}I just wanted to know

23:34.679 --> 23:37.249
{\an8}what you thought
about a prenup.

23:38.817 --> 23:41.119
{\an5}I don't feel
like this is you
that wants the prenup.

23:41.186 --> 23:44.489
I feel like it's
coming from...

23:44.556 --> 23:46.057
{\an3}Mrs. Sonja.

23:46.124 --> 23:47.993
I do not want
to sign a prenup.

23:48.059 --> 23:49.628
{\an7}I had this prenup
in my hand,

23:49.694 --> 23:51.663
{\an7}and I'ma just rip
the whole thing up.

23:51.730 --> 23:52.798
{\an8}Yes!

23:52.864 --> 23:54.299
{\an9}Wow. Wham!

23:54.366 --> 23:58.770
Real talk, like Ray
ripped his prenup up

23:58.837 --> 24:00.572
at the engagement party.

24:00.639 --> 24:02.674
{\an8}The prenup came from Sonja.

24:02.741 --> 24:07.179
{\an7}Little does she know,
I want the prenup for myself.

24:07.245 --> 24:09.114
{\an7}Little Brandi coming
up to me, yapping.

24:09.181 --> 24:11.650
{\an8}What did she say?

24:09.181 --> 24:11.650
{\an8}That you wanted
to get a prenup.

24:13.084 --> 24:14.452
{\an8}Don't let somebody come
tell me what's going on

24:14.519 --> 24:15.821
{\an8}without you telling me.

24:15.887 --> 24:17.489
{\an8}Somebody's butt's get
kicked out the wedding.

24:19.758 --> 24:22.460
(applause)

24:22.527 --> 24:24.963
Please welcome Sonja
to the stage.

24:25.030 --> 24:27.299
(cheering and applause)

24:27.365 --> 24:29.367
Now, Sonja, let me ask you,
why did you think that

24:29.434 --> 24:31.036
Ray needed the prenup?

24:31.102 --> 24:32.537
With him and Princess,

24:32.604 --> 24:35.440
{\an8}it was, you know, all of
the ups and downs.

24:35.507 --> 24:38.643
{\an1}You don't really know what
it's gonna be like in the end.

24:38.710 --> 24:40.612
Weren't her concerns
kind of legitimate?

24:40.679 --> 24:41.947
{\an5}Yeah, absolutely.

24:40.679 --> 24:41.947
(Nina)
Okay.

24:42.013 --> 24:43.548
She planted the seed,

24:43.615 --> 24:45.283
and then she saw the seed
grow in her own mind.

24:45.350 --> 24:47.118
And then her mind
grew away from me,

24:47.185 --> 24:49.788
and that's when I got mad,
and then I overreacted.

24:49.855 --> 24:52.157
How do you feel about them
being married now?

24:52.224 --> 24:55.427
I've come to know more
about Princess.

24:55.493 --> 24:58.697
When I met her grandmother
and I met her mom,

24:58.763 --> 25:00.799
and just having
a conversation about her

25:00.866 --> 25:04.336
{\an5}and her childhood,
and a lot of the things
that she's gone through,

25:04.402 --> 25:07.305
{\an1}it made me realize that
she's had to put up a guard

25:07.372 --> 25:08.974
to protect herself.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.475
She's strong,
I'm strong, too.

25:10.542 --> 25:12.510
Brandi, you went to Ray,
and you told him

25:12.577 --> 25:14.713
some information that Princess
told you in confidence,

25:14.779 --> 25:17.182
and in turn, she ejected you
from the wedding party,

25:17.249 --> 25:18.650
and you guys did
attend the wedding.

25:18.717 --> 25:20.385
How did you
feel about that?

25:20.452 --> 25:22.721
{\an8}Well, I always feel
like I'm the fixer.

25:22.787 --> 25:25.557
{\an1}So when Princess was
saying that to me,

25:25.624 --> 25:28.493
{\an1}I looked at it like,
"Oh, no, she feels this way.

25:28.560 --> 25:29.794
"I can help fix this.

25:29.861 --> 25:32.397
{\an1}"I'm a just tell Ray
where Princess is coming from,

25:32.464 --> 25:33.665
{\an1}so he can try
to understand--"

25:33.732 --> 25:35.166
No, but it was the way
I reacted, though.

25:35.233 --> 25:37.269
Stuff happened,
I blew up,

25:37.335 --> 25:40.071
they got mad, it was
a misunderstanding.

25:40.138 --> 25:41.907
But we got it
all together now,

25:41.973 --> 25:43.241
and we so happy
to be here together.

25:43.308 --> 25:45.310
{\an1}We all love each other.
We go through ups and downs.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.945
That's the nice PC answer.

25:47.012 --> 25:48.480
It's been rough
sometimes,

25:48.546 --> 25:50.015
{\an5}but as long
as you get through
the rough terrain,

25:50.081 --> 25:52.617
{\an5}and you get back
to the smooth roll,
God is good.

25:52.684 --> 25:53.919
(applause)

25:53.985 --> 25:55.553
{\an1}Now, Safaree, you were there.
How was the wedding?

25:55.620 --> 25:56.955
{\an5}(Safaree)
The wedding was amazing,
you know?

25:57.022 --> 25:59.624
Two beautiful people,
young, black,

25:59.691 --> 26:03.161
they had beautiful dogs
running down the aisle.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.196
{\an8}I wanna say thank you
for inviting me.

26:05.263 --> 26:08.633
{\an8}Floyd and Lyrica, they didn't
invite me to their wedding.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.036
{\an1}Our own parents
didn't come.

26:11.102 --> 26:13.004
{\an8}Now, Nikki, were you
dating Safaree at the time?

26:13.071 --> 26:14.439
{\an8}Did you go
to the wedding?

26:14.506 --> 26:15.907
{\an8}No, I didn't.

26:15.974 --> 26:17.709
{\an1}Nikki, were you invited
at one time to the wedding?

26:17.776 --> 26:19.444
No.

26:19.511 --> 26:21.646
It was actually
a very small wedding.

26:21.713 --> 26:23.782
{\an5}Nikki, did you feel
some type of way about
not being invited?

26:23.848 --> 26:25.717
I mean, I was
a little confused, 'cause,

26:25.784 --> 26:29.187
you know, I do feel like we had
some type of relationship.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.423
I haven't talked to her
in like two years.

26:31.489 --> 26:32.590
I mean, the reason
we didn't talk

26:32.657 --> 26:34.359
is 'cause the last time
we had texted

26:34.426 --> 26:35.694
you were like, "I'm not
with the fake (bleep)."

26:35.760 --> 26:37.228
And I was like,
"What are you talkin' 'bout?"

26:37.295 --> 26:39.431
I tried to reach out to you
and you never answered my call.

26:39.497 --> 26:41.399
{\an5}I'm not thirsty--

26:39.497 --> 26:41.399
You never reached out
to me after that.

26:41.466 --> 26:42.701
You know, whatever.

26:42.767 --> 26:43.868
(audience murmuring)

26:43.935 --> 26:45.103
(Nina)
Okay, we've gotta take a break,

26:45.170 --> 26:47.072
but when we return,
a New York native

26:47.138 --> 26:49.808
settles out West,
and he wants it all.

26:49.874 --> 26:52.277
It's "Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood:
The Reunion."

26:52.344 --> 26:55.380
(cheering and applause)

26:55.447 --> 26:56.815
{\an7}Well, that isn't her nose
or her body

26:56.881 --> 26:58.683
{\an8}or her cheeks or her chin.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.085
{\an8}You aren't gettin' what?

27:00.151 --> 27:01.519
{\an8}Keep on talkin' (bleep).

27:01.586 --> 27:03.722
{\an7}What's that (bleep)
you talkin'?

27:03.788 --> 27:04.956
{\an8}(audience gasping)

27:06.024 --> 27:07.092
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

27:13.531 --> 27:16.668
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

27:16.735 --> 27:19.838
{\an8}Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood: The Reunion."

27:19.904 --> 27:21.573
Despite what you
may have heard,

27:21.639 --> 27:23.641
Safaree wasn't crying
over his ex.

27:23.708 --> 27:26.344
Instead, he was packing
his bags for Hollywood

27:26.411 --> 27:29.681
where he quickly found
a new darling named Nikki.

27:29.748 --> 27:31.983
Yo, wild one,
it's Safaree here.

27:32.050 --> 27:34.552
Y'all may know me from
my past relationship with my ex,

27:34.619 --> 27:35.720
Nikki Minaj.

27:35.787 --> 27:38.056
I'm seeing a lot
of tweets from,

27:38.123 --> 27:39.324
you know, your ex.

27:39.391 --> 27:41.026
As much as I want to get away

27:41.092 --> 27:42.927
from my past
relationship with Nikki,

27:42.994 --> 27:45.263
every interview I do,
they bring her name up.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.832
{\an5}I put in work,
I just want to get what
I want to get from my work.

27:51.436 --> 27:52.904
(Nikki)
I know it's all over the blogs

27:52.971 --> 27:54.506
that Safaree is a gold digger

27:54.572 --> 27:56.041
and got nothing
going for himself,

27:56.107 --> 27:58.510
but to me, that's far
from the truth.

27:58.576 --> 28:00.211
{\an5}This guys says that
they are building
something.

28:00.278 --> 28:02.781
Safaree Minaj
and Nikki.

28:02.847 --> 28:05.083
{\an7}His situation just seems
really messy.

28:05.150 --> 28:07.919
{\an8}And I just don't want you
to be involved in that mess.

28:07.986 --> 28:09.621
{\an8}He looks like a lame.

28:09.687 --> 28:12.290
{\an8}(Nikki)
I understand that my girls
are just looking out for me.

28:12.357 --> 28:13.858
{\an8}But it's not his fault
if he got a thing

28:13.925 --> 28:16.027
for some fine boss bitches
named Nikki.

28:16.094 --> 28:19.531
(cheering and applause)

28:19.597 --> 28:22.133
Safaree, what is it
with you and Nikkis?

28:22.200 --> 28:24.803
{\an8}I can't control
who God attracts me to.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.471
{\an8}Nikkis with big asses.

28:26.538 --> 28:27.872
(laughter)

28:27.939 --> 28:29.641
You seem like a serial
monogamist.

28:29.707 --> 28:30.742
Is that true?

28:30.809 --> 28:32.010
When I find
the right person,

28:32.077 --> 28:32.944
like, that's how
I want to be, you know?

28:33.011 --> 28:35.947
But I'm not gonna, um...

28:36.014 --> 28:37.882
Um, I lost
total track of thought

28:37.949 --> 28:40.318
{\an1}and forgot what the (bleep)
I was just saying.

28:40.385 --> 28:41.886
{\an5}(Nina)
You are covered a lot
in the media,

28:41.953 --> 28:43.254
and a lot of it
does seem negative.

28:43.321 --> 28:45.023
Why do you think that you've
gotten a bad rap?

28:45.090 --> 28:47.892
{\an1}When I hear people say,
"Oh, Safaree's a gold digger,"

28:47.959 --> 28:49.894
{\an5}and I'm looking for
come-ups and all this
type of stuff...

28:49.961 --> 28:51.262
Okay.

28:51.329 --> 28:54.099
{\an1}I walked away from somebody
worth $50 million

28:54.165 --> 28:55.900
and didn't think twice.

28:55.967 --> 28:57.769
That's not a gold digger.

28:57.836 --> 28:59.771
{\an4}You can call him stupid,
but you can't call him
a gold digger.

28:59.838 --> 29:01.372
(laughter)

29:01.439 --> 29:02.774
{\an8}Talk to 'em, Safaree.

29:02.841 --> 29:04.709
Nia, let me ask you,
because you were very clear.

29:04.776 --> 29:06.010
You said you felt like
he was a lame.

29:06.077 --> 29:07.145
You still feel like that?

29:07.212 --> 29:09.547
{\an8}That was before
I ever really meet him.

29:09.614 --> 29:11.716
I like Safaree.
He's very nice.

29:11.783 --> 29:13.351
That's what I'm
talkin' about.

29:13.418 --> 29:14.519
{\an5}I accept your apology.

29:13.418 --> 29:14.519
He's a good person.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.887
{\an5}He really is.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.887
Thank you.

29:15.954 --> 29:18.490
Okay, we heard Rosa
call you Safaree Minaj.

29:18.556 --> 29:20.191
{\an1}How do you feel
about that reference?

29:20.258 --> 29:21.659
Actually, I've never
heard that before.

29:21.726 --> 29:23.695
That was the first time
I heard it.

29:23.761 --> 29:27.732
It was funny, but it
was a bit uncalled for.

29:27.799 --> 29:29.167
{\an5}(Nina)
Can you clear
something up for me?

29:29.234 --> 29:30.502
Because there was a report

29:30.568 --> 29:32.036
that you were suing your ex--
is that true?

29:32.103 --> 29:33.738
No, what had happened was

29:33.805 --> 29:37.976
my lawyers had just
drafted up...

29:38.042 --> 29:39.978
like some things,
just said, "Listen...

29:40.044 --> 29:41.546
"Here, look at this.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.915
We're not saying
this is a lawsuit."

29:43.982 --> 29:46.184
So I don't know
if the other side

29:46.251 --> 29:47.886
didn't explain what
that was and just said,

29:47.952 --> 29:49.487
{\an5}"Hey, we got a lawsuit."

29:47.952 --> 29:49.487
It's not happening.

29:49.554 --> 29:51.756
{\an5}Nothing was ever filed.

29:49.554 --> 29:51.756
{\an1}Ray J,
I see you over there,

29:51.823 --> 29:52.790
coaching him still.

29:52.857 --> 29:54.225
{\an1}No, no, no,
I'm just saying...

29:54.292 --> 29:56.294
{\an1}Because, listen,
'cause I do manage, too.

29:56.361 --> 29:57.862
{\an5}Like, I'm a manager.

29:56.361 --> 29:57.862
{\an3}Okay.

29:57.929 --> 29:59.397
{\an4}So I'm just like
when you getting all
this stuff around you

29:59.464 --> 30:01.432
{\an1}and nobody got your back,
it's like, tough.

30:01.499 --> 30:02.767
{\an1}So I'm just
trying to help.

30:02.834 --> 30:03.935
We appreciate
your advice.

30:04.002 --> 30:05.737
Well, while everyone
was suspicious

30:05.803 --> 30:07.172
about Safaree's intentions,

30:07.238 --> 30:09.941
it was Nikki Baby
who was covering things up.

30:10.008 --> 30:12.911
And even though she usually
manages to get what she wants,

30:12.977 --> 30:16.381
Nikki learned the hard way that
you can't always have it all.

30:16.447 --> 30:17.782
Watch.

30:17.849 --> 30:19.551
♪♪

30:19.617 --> 30:21.519
{\an7}I'm actually talking
to two people.

30:21.586 --> 30:23.354
{\an8}What?

30:21.586 --> 30:23.354
{\an8}Are y'all
in a mother(bleep),

30:23.421 --> 30:26.457
{\an8}uh, tri-- triship?

30:26.524 --> 30:28.059
{\an7}They don't know
about each other.

30:28.126 --> 30:29.294
{\an9}Oh, my God.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.162
{\an7}Why would I even
want to waste my time

30:31.229 --> 30:32.330
{\an8}wit anybody else?

30:32.397 --> 30:34.132
{\an7}They're not you.
You know what I'm saying?

30:34.199 --> 30:37.402
{\an7}But what about you,
you dealing with anybody else?

30:37.468 --> 30:40.004
{\an8}It's not like, "Oh, I have
another man or whatever."

30:40.071 --> 30:41.406
{\an8}It's just-- I'm working.

30:41.472 --> 30:43.608
Today, I'm doing a photo shoot
for Nude by Nikki.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.677
So I had to get
a true sex symbol

30:45.743 --> 30:47.178
to show it off.

30:47.245 --> 30:49.280
Rosa Acosta
is not letting me down.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.316
This girls' so goddamn bad,
she made me wanna

30:51.382 --> 30:53.685
take my clothes off
and join her, too.

30:53.751 --> 30:55.587
You know what's next door
to my store?

30:55.653 --> 30:57.789
Casa Mia,
that Rosa Acosta.

30:57.855 --> 30:59.557
Um, her shop.

30:59.624 --> 31:02.860
I heard they both,
know what I'm saying?

31:02.927 --> 31:04.095
Like one and one.

31:04.162 --> 31:05.730
But when you say they one,
what you saying?

31:05.797 --> 31:07.865
Don't get your feelings
caught up in one.

31:07.932 --> 31:10.668
If she with somebody else,
you gotta demand both.

31:10.735 --> 31:13.238
You hit with a...
"I want it all."

31:19.244 --> 31:21.179
(Nikki)
Oh, my God, I didn't think

31:21.246 --> 31:22.981
they would catch me
slipping like this.

31:23.047 --> 31:25.016
{\an1}You living, like,
a double life right now.

31:25.083 --> 31:26.184
{\an1}Why you so upset?
We're not in a relationship.

31:26.251 --> 31:28.686
I want the both of y'all.

31:28.753 --> 31:29.954
What do you think this is,
walking in here,

31:30.021 --> 31:31.556
trying to say,
"Hey, can I (bleep), too?"

31:31.623 --> 31:34.058
{\an5}That's not cool.
You not that type
of guy.

31:35.526 --> 31:36.761
This is some bull(bleep).

31:36.828 --> 31:38.329
I was waiting for
the moment to tell you!

31:38.396 --> 31:39.430
{\an7}All right.

31:38.396 --> 31:39.430
{\an8}I do feel bad.

31:39.497 --> 31:41.132
{\an7}This is what happens
when you wait.

31:43.001 --> 31:45.536
(cheering and applause)

31:45.603 --> 31:48.172
Nikki, let me ask you,
why not, off top,

31:48.239 --> 31:50.775
just tell both
Rosa and Safaree the truth?

31:50.842 --> 31:53.177
{\an8}I have no excuse, you know,
I own up to my actions.

31:53.244 --> 31:54.846
And I should have told them,
you know what I'm saying?

31:54.912 --> 31:56.247
'Cause if we're not committed,

31:56.314 --> 31:58.383
I don't really need
to lie to anybody.

31:58.449 --> 32:00.785
{\an4}So, you know,
it definitely didn't
have to get to that point.

32:00.852 --> 32:03.755
But I think I was just nervous
of hurting somebody's feelings.

32:03.821 --> 32:06.090
Who were you more angry at,
Rosa, when you found out

32:06.157 --> 32:07.725
about the both
of them dating?

32:07.792 --> 32:09.527
{\an8}I was more angry at Nikki.

32:09.594 --> 32:11.229
{\an8}Um, it did bother me

32:11.296 --> 32:13.598
{\an1}that he say you know,
"I want the both of you guys."

32:13.665 --> 32:15.733
No, no, I said,
"I want it all,"

32:15.800 --> 32:16.734
not "both of y'all."

32:16.801 --> 32:18.469
{\an1}See, it's
about the wording.

32:18.536 --> 32:19.904
{\an8}It's the same thing.

32:18.536 --> 32:19.904
{\an8}No, it's not.

32:19.971 --> 32:22.340
{\an7}No, no, it's not.
He said both of y'all.

32:22.407 --> 32:24.108
{\an5}No.

32:22.407 --> 32:24.108
{\an1}That wasn't what
I told him to say.

32:24.175 --> 32:25.943
{\an5}I said, "I want it all."

32:24.175 --> 32:25.943
It's the same thing.

32:26.010 --> 32:27.312
{\an1}That means everything
in the room.

32:27.378 --> 32:28.513
(Nina)
Now, is Safaree would have been

32:28.579 --> 32:29.847
a little smoother
with his approach,

32:29.914 --> 32:31.549
{\an4}No!

32:29.914 --> 32:31.549
...and maybe worded it
differently--

32:31.616 --> 32:33.584
{\an5}Absolutely not.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.584
No!

32:33.651 --> 32:35.353
{\an5}No, no, no.

32:33.651 --> 32:35.353
Safaree, you don't
even like threesomes.

32:35.420 --> 32:36.354
Let's be honest.

32:36.421 --> 32:37.655
(Nina)
Is that true?

32:37.722 --> 32:39.557
Are you more conservative
than we know?

32:39.624 --> 32:40.758
I'm not gonna lie.

32:40.825 --> 32:42.060
I be hearing that
there's some girls

32:42.126 --> 32:43.261
who be down
for that, so--

32:43.328 --> 32:44.662
Who you
hearing from, Ray J?

32:44.729 --> 32:46.097
{\an4}No, no.

32:44.729 --> 32:46.097
(laughter)

32:46.164 --> 32:47.465
(Nikki)
According to "sources."

32:47.532 --> 32:48.599
According to sources.

32:48.666 --> 32:49.834
There's people
in relationships

32:49.901 --> 32:51.402
who like to do
that type of thing.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.705
I think she shouldn't
be so selfish.

32:53.771 --> 32:56.541
{\an7}Like, when he said,
"I want the both of y'all,"

32:56.607 --> 32:59.010
you should have gave him
the both of y'all.

32:59.077 --> 33:00.511
(laughter and applause)

33:00.578 --> 33:03.281
Now,<i> that</i> is my G.

33:03.348 --> 33:05.717
You know I got
your back, baby.

33:05.783 --> 33:08.119
{\an5}(Nina)
Was that your first serious
relationship with a woman?

33:08.186 --> 33:09.287
{\an1}No.

33:09.354 --> 33:11.489
{\an7}Didn't you used to date
Amber Rose, right?

33:11.556 --> 33:12.657
{\an1}(Jason)
Oh.

33:12.724 --> 33:15.893
(audience murmuring)

33:15.960 --> 33:17.128
Is that true, Rosa?

33:17.195 --> 33:18.763
{\an1}Yeah, yeah,
we were talking.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.833
{\an1}I love her very much, 'cause
we're still very good friends.

33:21.899 --> 33:23.568
{\an5}(Nina)
We know you like
to hold onto your own.

33:23.634 --> 33:25.036
Would you call Rosa
your own?

33:25.103 --> 33:27.138
Are you two
dating still?

33:27.205 --> 33:28.139
{\an5}You are?

33:27.205 --> 33:28.139
Yeah, we still date.

33:28.206 --> 33:30.041
We still hang out.

33:30.108 --> 33:31.042
Are you guys
involved?

33:31.109 --> 33:32.076
{\an3}(bleep).

33:32.143 --> 33:33.544
(Nina)
It's kind of oozing out.

33:33.611 --> 33:34.712
I mean...
(laughing)

33:34.779 --> 33:36.013
What do you
want us to do?

33:36.080 --> 33:38.449
I don't wanna get y'all
excited over here.

33:38.516 --> 33:39.617
Do you wanna see?

33:39.684 --> 33:41.753
(cheering and applause)

33:45.456 --> 33:48.826
{\an5}Ray J's looking away.
He's not even looking
or anything.

33:48.893 --> 33:50.561
(applause)

33:50.628 --> 33:52.697
{\an8}Calm down, married man.

33:52.764 --> 33:54.565
{\an5}(Nina)
All right, we've got
to take a break,

33:54.632 --> 33:56.801
but don't move, because,
when we get back,

33:56.868 --> 33:59.103
we'll find out if the store
built on a trust fund

33:59.170 --> 34:00.271
was worth the money.

34:00.338 --> 34:01.272
Stick around.

34:01.339 --> 34:02.807
{\an3}Blow it up!

34:02.874 --> 34:04.442
(cheering and applause)

34:04.509 --> 34:06.377
{\an8}How often does Fetty
see Khari?

34:06.444 --> 34:07.578
{\an8}Who?

34:07.645 --> 34:09.981
{\an8}Have you paid back
the whole 27,000?

34:10.047 --> 34:12.083
{\an8}Yes, I have.

34:10.047 --> 34:12.083
{\an7}That's not true,
though.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.951
{\an7}I would have never touched
my child's savings.

34:14.018 --> 34:16.721
{\an8}I could give a (bleep)
if it thrives or fails.

34:23.094 --> 34:24.896
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

34:24.962 --> 34:27.665
{\an8}Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood: The Reunion."

34:27.732 --> 34:29.801
Money is said to be
the root of all evil,

34:29.867 --> 34:32.003
so when Brandi opened up
a boutique

34:32.069 --> 34:35.672
with the 27 stacks Max gave her
to invest in their son's future,

34:35.739 --> 34:38.176
there was nothing good
in store for them.

34:38.242 --> 34:39.310
Check it out.

34:39.377 --> 34:40.311
(baby babbling)

34:40.378 --> 34:42.413
Baby, what is all that?

34:42.480 --> 34:44.215
{\an8}Money, babe, it's money!

34:44.282 --> 34:46.217
{\an8}Well, yeah, you know,
I was thinking about
what you said.

34:46.284 --> 34:49.152
{\an8}We just, like, we need
to have a savings for you.

34:49.219 --> 34:51.422
{\an8}'Cause it's to the EP
for 27,000.

34:51.489 --> 34:52.723
{\an8}So all that money
is his.

34:52.790 --> 34:54.826
{\an8}What is this?

34:54.891 --> 34:56.060
{\an8}This is amazing.

34:56.127 --> 34:58.629
{\an7}So how-- how did you
put all this together?

34:58.696 --> 35:01.165
{\an8}(sighs)

35:01.232 --> 35:04.769
{\an7}You did not spend
that money.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.003
{\an8}Oh, my God.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.003
{\an8}I didn't put a dollar

35:06.070 --> 35:09.073
{\an8}into Brandus' savings,
not a dollar.

35:09.140 --> 35:12.543
{\an8}This is 50% our store.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.145
{\an8}And where you get the money?

35:14.212 --> 35:15.613
{\an8}(stammering)

35:15.680 --> 35:18.416
{\an9}The 27,000

35:18.483 --> 35:19.884
{\an8}that you had...

35:19.951 --> 35:22.386
{\an8}I know you not talking
about my son's money.

35:22.453 --> 35:24.355
{\an8}Don't leave me in
the middle of the store!

35:24.422 --> 35:27.024
{\an8}I'm going to pay you
all the money back.

35:27.091 --> 35:29.594
{\an8}No!

35:29.660 --> 35:30.628
{\an8}Get off my
mother(bleep) car.

35:30.695 --> 35:32.396
{\an7}Now...

35:30.695 --> 35:32.396
{\an8}Go, go, go, go, go.

35:32.463 --> 35:33.931
Get the (bleep) off.

35:33.998 --> 35:36.868
No! No! No!

35:36.934 --> 35:39.303
{\an5}He threw a ball.

35:36.934 --> 35:39.303
Hey, what's up?

35:39.370 --> 35:41.772
I thought you
wasn't coming.

35:41.839 --> 35:43.741
{\an5}I ain't gonna miss
my son's birthday
party.

35:43.808 --> 35:46.911
{\an7}I will do whatever it takes
to get your trust back.

35:49.113 --> 35:51.516
Why don't we just leave it
at I'm coming home?

35:51.582 --> 35:53.451
{\an4}Okay.

35:51.582 --> 35:53.451
And call it that.

35:53.518 --> 35:57.622
(cheering and applause)

35:57.688 --> 35:59.724
Glad you finally decided
to go home.

35:59.790 --> 36:01.826
Were you really
that upset or--

36:01.893 --> 36:04.028
{\an7}I was mad at first
because of the treachery.

36:04.095 --> 36:06.163
{\an5}Mm-hmm.

36:04.095 --> 36:06.163
{\an1}And that everybody
knew but me.

36:06.230 --> 36:07.965
{\an1}So I felt kind of stupid,
I ain't gonna lie.

36:08.032 --> 36:09.734
{\an1}But then, when I thought
about it, I'm like,

36:09.800 --> 36:11.302
{\an1}"You know, that
wasn't a bad move."

36:11.369 --> 36:13.404
Was the issue that
she kept it from you?

36:13.471 --> 36:15.773
No, the issue was
I have a bad habit

36:15.840 --> 36:19.210
{\an4}of spending money fast,
so she rides down on me
on that.

36:19.277 --> 36:22.079
{\an4}So when I finally
am like, "Okay, you
take the bread,

36:22.146 --> 36:25.516
{\an4}and you be in control,"
she go do the same (bleep)
I go do.

36:25.583 --> 36:27.151
{\an1}But it's cool
when she do it.

36:27.218 --> 36:29.720
{\an8}I was wrong, there's
no justification.

36:29.787 --> 36:31.589
{\an8}What I did was in
the right place,

36:31.656 --> 36:34.225
{\an1}and it was a great idea,
but the way I went about it

36:34.292 --> 36:35.526
was just completely
unacceptable.

36:35.593 --> 36:38.563
{\an1}Low.
Dirty and underhanded.

36:38.629 --> 36:40.965
{\an5}My husband was right.

36:38.629 --> 36:40.965
Now, Moniece, let me ask you,

36:41.032 --> 36:43.100
did you feel that Brandi was
justified in using the money?

36:43.167 --> 36:46.137
{\an7}She felt that that was the best
solution for her family.

36:46.203 --> 36:48.906
I could give a (bleep)
if it thrives or fails.

36:48.973 --> 36:50.741
{\an5}Kudos to her.

36:48.973 --> 36:50.741
(Nina)
Okay.

36:50.808 --> 36:52.243
Shanda, you're a mom
as well,

36:52.310 --> 36:54.412
and I know you guys
save for your children.

36:54.478 --> 36:55.980
Would you have used
a savings fund

36:56.047 --> 36:57.815
for your child
to fund a store?

36:57.882 --> 36:59.717
{\an7}No, I would have never
touched my child's savings.

36:59.784 --> 37:02.353
{\an1}At all, but I don't think
she had bad intentions.

37:02.420 --> 37:05.389
{\an5}I want to be clear,
I didn't take my son's
savings and go spend it.

37:05.456 --> 37:07.024
This was for
a CD account.

37:07.091 --> 37:08.225
{\an1}(Nina)
Okay, got it.

37:08.292 --> 37:09.393
He's had a savings
since he was born.

37:09.460 --> 37:11.262
{\an1}Okay, well, A1 how would
you feel about it?

37:11.329 --> 37:14.398
{\an8}I would feel exactly
like Max felt.

37:14.465 --> 37:16.100
And if she jumped
on my whip,

37:16.167 --> 37:17.535
I'd be going crazy.

37:17.602 --> 37:18.669
(laughter)

37:18.736 --> 37:20.371
Run that ass over.

37:20.438 --> 37:22.707
{\an5}(Nina)
Have you paid back
the whole 27,000?

37:22.773 --> 37:23.874
Yes, I have.

37:23.941 --> 37:26.177
(applause)

37:26.243 --> 37:27.445
How's the store doing?
Is it still open?

37:27.511 --> 37:30.147
Very well, and, yes,
it's still open.

37:30.214 --> 37:31.282
All right, but I'm glad
that you guys are good.

37:31.349 --> 37:33.117
I'm glad the store
is doing good.

37:33.184 --> 37:34.585
We've got to take a break,
but don't move,

37:34.652 --> 37:36.787
because when we get back,
the collaboration between

37:36.854 --> 37:40.157
Masika and Fetty Wap
is a whole lot more than music.

37:40.224 --> 37:42.293
It's "Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood:
The Reunion."

37:42.360 --> 37:44.228
(cheering and applause)

37:46.197 --> 37:48.199
{\an8}Hazel E. made some allegations

37:48.265 --> 37:50.635
{\an8}that Fetty isn't your
daughter's father.

37:50.701 --> 37:52.403
{\an7}Well, that isn't her nose
or her body

37:52.470 --> 37:54.005
{\an8}or her cheeks or her chin.

37:54.071 --> 37:55.606
{\an8}Please welcome Hazel
to the stage.

37:55.673 --> 37:57.742
{\an8}(audience gasping)

37:57.808 --> 37:59.076
{\an8}You're gonna get what?

37:59.143 --> 38:01.345
{\an8}You keep on talking (bleep).

38:01.412 --> 38:02.747
{\an8}Come on, Masika,
please.

38:02.813 --> 38:04.248
{\an7}What's that (bleep)
you talking?

38:04.315 --> 38:05.282
{\an8}(Nina)
Hey, hey!

38:11.589 --> 38:14.558
(cheering and applause)

38:14.625 --> 38:16.761
♪♪

38:16.827 --> 38:19.664
Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood: The Reunion."

38:19.730 --> 38:22.333
This season, we welcomed
Masika back to the show,

38:22.400 --> 38:25.636
who, on hiatus, got pregnant
by rapper Fetty Wap.

38:25.703 --> 38:27.304
But, with a baby
coming their way,

38:27.371 --> 38:29.240
Fetty Wap's fear
of being trapped

38:29.306 --> 38:31.475
had him questioning whether
Masika was his queen.

38:31.542 --> 38:33.310
Let's take a look.

38:33.377 --> 38:35.212
(Masika)
Last summer was crazy.

38:35.279 --> 38:37.148
I had a had single
with Fetty Wap,

38:37.214 --> 38:39.617
and we made a baby.

38:39.684 --> 38:41.519
From the time
I broke the news to Fetty,

38:41.585 --> 38:42.687
he's made this a living hell.

38:42.753 --> 38:44.422
And to add insult
to injury,

38:44.488 --> 38:46.991
now you're publicly
denying our child?

38:47.058 --> 38:50.294
{\an1}When you first called,
I was a little... skeptical.

38:50.361 --> 38:52.163
{\an1}I wasn't really sure
what to think.

38:52.229 --> 38:53.631
I just have to man up.

38:53.698 --> 38:56.000
Thank you for...
letting me show you

38:56.067 --> 38:58.335
that I really wanna be
her-- her dad.

38:58.402 --> 39:00.004
{\an8}(baby crying)

39:00.071 --> 39:01.472
{\an8}(Masika)
With all the ups and downs,

39:01.539 --> 39:04.775
{\an8}it just means so much
to me that Fetty made it here.

39:04.842 --> 39:06.677
{\an8}Say, "Bye, Daddy."

39:06.744 --> 39:09.246
{\an8}Have you spoken
with Sika?

39:09.313 --> 39:12.416
{\an7}Yo, man, last time we talked
wasn't really that good.

39:12.483 --> 39:14.885
{\an7}That's why I just wanna
make this (bleep) like...

39:14.952 --> 39:16.387
{\an8}clear with her, you feel me?

39:16.454 --> 39:19.190
{\an7}Like, "I don't wanna be
in a relationship with you."

39:19.256 --> 39:21.559
{\an7}Are you...
ready to apologize

39:21.625 --> 39:24.161
{\an8}for the asinine comment
you made about my child?

39:24.228 --> 39:25.529
{\an8}You actually referred
to my record,

39:25.596 --> 39:27.298
{\an8}saying it wasn't your B.D.

39:25.596 --> 39:27.298
{\an8}And it's not.

39:27.364 --> 39:29.533
{\an8}And then I said, "Well, maybe
the child isn't his as well."

39:29.600 --> 39:30.568
{\an8}Then you're done.

39:30.634 --> 39:32.303
{\an8}I expected you
to look magnificent.

39:32.369 --> 39:34.839
{\an8}I'm actually disappointed.

39:32.369 --> 39:34.839
{\an7}And I expected you to,
nasal "hee," I did.

39:34.905 --> 39:36.674
{\an8}Oh... (bleep)!

39:36.741 --> 39:38.642
{\an8}Bitch! You got
me (bleep) up.

39:38.709 --> 39:42.480
{\an5}Don't come play with
the big dogs if you can't
handle it, baby girl.

39:42.546 --> 39:45.116
(cheering and applause)

39:45.182 --> 39:46.383
{\an4}(Nina)
All right, Masika,
you're a new mother.

39:46.450 --> 39:47.485
{\an5}Yes.

39:46.450 --> 39:47.485
Let me ask you.

39:47.551 --> 39:49.787
How often does Fetty
see Khari?

39:49.854 --> 39:51.889
{\an1}Um, now it's much,
much better, much more often.

39:51.956 --> 39:54.325
He has since, you know,
apologized again.

39:54.391 --> 39:56.127
And we're starting fresh.

39:56.193 --> 39:58.863
{\an1}How long were you dating
before you became pregnant?

39:58.929 --> 40:00.598
Couple months.
Um, you know,

40:00.664 --> 40:03.267
{\an4}everybody wants to say how--
you know, their opinions
or what they think.

40:03.334 --> 40:05.770
You know, regardless of
whether he was fully there

40:05.836 --> 40:07.538
in support didn't make
a difference to me.

40:07.605 --> 40:09.573
{\an1}I'm a grown woman,
I'm gonna handle my business.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.976
Former "Love &amp; Hip Hop"
cast member Hazel E.

40:12.042 --> 40:14.245
{\an5}made some allegations--

40:12.042 --> 40:14.245
{\an3}Who? Who?

40:14.311 --> 40:16.814
{\an5}Hazel made some allegations...

40:14.311 --> 40:16.814
{\an3}Who?

40:16.881 --> 40:19.350
...that Fetty isn't
your daughter's father.

40:19.416 --> 40:21.652
Well, that isn't her nose
or her body or her cheeks

40:21.719 --> 40:25.189
{\an4}or her chin or her butt
or her boob or her hair
or anything.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.691
So she should know about
what doesn't belong to somebody,

40:27.758 --> 40:30.861
so to speak negatively
about my child

40:30.928 --> 40:33.164
out of turn
is inappropriate.

40:33.230 --> 40:35.866
Let's get Hazel's
side of the story.

40:35.933 --> 40:37.134
I'm not sitting on
the couch with her.

40:37.201 --> 40:38.302
Like I said, that one
scene I gave her,

40:38.369 --> 40:40.070
she didn't apologize
about my child,

40:40.137 --> 40:41.772
{\an1}so I'm not giving her
any more of my camera time.

40:41.839 --> 40:42.940
Please welcome Hazel
to the stage.

40:43.007 --> 40:44.775
Okay, well... to all--
I'm leaving.

40:44.842 --> 40:46.544
It's her or me.
No, I already said--

40:46.610 --> 40:47.545
Masika, come on, sit.

40:47.611 --> 40:48.913
You gonna get what?

40:48.979 --> 40:51.215
{\an1}You keep on
talking (bleep).

40:51.282 --> 40:52.216
You gonna get what?

40:52.283 --> 40:53.617
Come on, Masika,
sit down.

40:53.684 --> 40:55.085
{\an1}What's that (bleep)
you talkin'?

40:55.152 --> 40:56.187
(Nina)
Hey, hey!

41:01.792 --> 41:03.227
{\an8}You a Becky, a proud one.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.930
{\an8}You talk with every tooth
in your face, Jesus Christ!

41:05.996 --> 41:08.098
{\an8}♪♪

41:08.165 --> 41:10.034
{\an8}You better give me my props.
You have to.

41:10.100 --> 41:11.502
{\an8}Not like that.

41:10.100 --> 41:11.502
{\an8}(audience gasps)

41:11.569 --> 41:13.070
{\an8}You're just, like, too corny.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.372
{\an8}Like, you need to just
tone it down a little bit.

41:15.439 --> 41:16.774
{\an8}Masika, come on, sit.

41:16.841 --> 41:18.342
{\an8}Beat yo (bleep) ass!

41:16.841 --> 41:18.342
{\an8}How 'bout that?

41:18.409 --> 41:20.344
{\an8}What you talkin' about?

41:20.411 --> 41:23.581
{\an8}She didn't become Lyrica
just... without some guidance.

41:23.647 --> 41:25.516
{\an8}It's because of how
I trained her.

41:25.583 --> 41:27.084
{\an8}(laughter)

41:27.151 --> 41:30.354
{\an7}When the (bleep) was we in love?
Be honest.

41:30.421 --> 41:31.989
{\an8}Was this incident
a wake-up call?

41:32.056 --> 41:33.791
{\an8}I'm scared (bleep)less.

41:33.858 --> 41:36.360
{\an7}Shut the (bleep) up.
I'm not talking to you.

41:36.427 --> 41:38.395
{\an8}Turn your fat ass around.

41:38.462 --> 41:41.065
{\an7}And he got mad 'cause I said
Safaree had a better (bleep)
than him.

41:41.131 --> 41:42.433
{\an8}The only thing burning
is that vagina.

41:42.499 --> 41:44.235
{\an8}(laughter and gasping)

41:44.301 --> 41:45.603
{\an8}He asked her about her (bleep),

41:45.669 --> 41:47.838
{\an8}and she said she wanted
to (bleep) his (bleep).

41:47.905 --> 41:49.039
{\an8}What?

41:49.106 --> 41:51.275
{\an8}Your husband just
had a baby on you!

41:51.342 --> 41:52.343
{\an8}(audience groaning)
