Tonight is all about

02:11.463 --> 02:14.669
Country Kings.

02:14.099 --> 02:15.200
Now Ester, let me

02:14.099 --> 02:15.200
ask you this.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.699
What are you gonna be

02:15.300 --> 02:17.699
looking for tonight?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.638
- I think that

02:17.137 --> 02:18.638
at the end of the day,

02:18.737 --> 02:19.705
when it comes down

02:18.737 --> 02:19.705
to Country,

02:19.806 --> 02:21.373
it's tellin'--

02:19.806 --> 02:21.373
spillin' the heart out

02:21.473 --> 02:24.443
and-and-and relating

02:21.473 --> 02:24.443
to everyone in the audience.

02:24.544 --> 02:26.780
And I feel like that's what

02:24.544 --> 02:26.780
Country brings to the world.

02:26.879 --> 02:29.819
- Absolutely.

02:26.879 --> 02:29.819
I like that, y'all.

02:29.115 --> 02:32.849
So first up,

02:29.115 --> 02:32.849
he's a former football player,

02:32.185 --> 02:33.887
but now it's time

02:32.185 --> 02:33.887
to see him suit up

02:33.986 --> 02:35.921
as a Country King.

02:33.986 --> 02:35.921
Let's go.

02:36.889 --> 02:38.123
[cheers and applause]

02:39.626 --> 02:41.194
- My name's Adam Tucker.

02:41.293 --> 02:43.329
I'm from a town in West Virginia

02:41.293 --> 02:43.329
called Sissonville.

02:44.997 --> 02:47.766
I cover one of the biggest

02:44.997 --> 02:47.766
Country music artists

02:47.866 --> 02:49.635
of all time, Tim McGraw.

02:51.103 --> 02:54.699
I became a fan

02:51.103 --> 02:54.699
of him in 1992.

02:54.106 --> 02:57.110
He became my Elvis Presley.

02:54.106 --> 02:57.110
I watched everything he did.

02:57.143 --> 02:59.378
You get in my car,

02:57.143 --> 02:59.378
I still have a CD player.

02:59.478 --> 03:01.480
You hit eject,

02:59.478 --> 03:01.480
it's gonna be his CD.

03:03.616 --> 03:05.217
I was going to college,

03:05.318 --> 03:07.319
but I was the quarterback

03:05.318 --> 03:07.319
of the football team.

03:07.419 --> 03:08.822
We'd be on a bus ride

03:07.419 --> 03:08.822
to a football game,

03:08.921 --> 03:10.924
they, "Hey, can you sing

03:08.921 --> 03:10.924
a-a Tim McGraw song for us?"

03:11.569 --> 03:13.560
I'm like, "Yeah,

03:11.569 --> 03:13.560
I'll sing you a song."

03:13.659 --> 03:15.949
And I would sing

03:13.659 --> 03:15.949
to football players

03:15.194 --> 03:17.229
on the back of

03:15.194 --> 03:17.229
a bus, you know?

03:17.329 --> 03:20.800
I figured, hey,

03:17.329 --> 03:20.800
people say I can sing.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.235
Let's give it a shot.

03:23.336 --> 03:25.710
It was not easy.

03:25.104 --> 03:26.306
All the record companies,

03:26.406 --> 03:28.640
"Man, you're such a hard worker,

03:26.406 --> 03:28.640
you're such a great entertainer.

03:28.741 --> 03:32.512
"You just sound too much

03:28.741 --> 03:32.512
like the real guy."

03:32.611 --> 03:35.115
And then, I said,

03:32.611 --> 03:35.115
end it now

03:35.215 --> 03:38.384
and go pursue what you know

03:35.215 --> 03:38.384
you could've done

03:38.485 --> 03:39.651
six years earlier.

03:39.786 --> 03:42.655
**

03:42.756 --> 03:44.223
I have a little boy

03:42.756 --> 03:44.223
and a little girl.

03:44.324 --> 03:47.227
They love what I do, and I-I

03:44.324 --> 03:47.227
think they're proud of me.

03:47.326 --> 03:48.561
- Yeah.

03:47.326 --> 03:48.561
- You know, my children

03:48.661 --> 03:49.528
love the music.

03:50.530 --> 03:51.831
And they realize that

03:50.530 --> 03:51.831
Daddy's enjoying that.

03:53.599 --> 03:56.836
The artist that I portray,

03:53.599 --> 03:56.836
he is into fitness big time.

03:56.936 --> 03:58.771
I think he has written

03:56.936 --> 03:58.771
a book about it,

03:58.872 --> 04:00.840
so I gotta keep up

03:58.872 --> 04:00.840
with him, man.

04:00.939 --> 04:02.474
- 10 years and going, bro.

04:00.939 --> 04:02.474
I got you.

04:02.574 --> 04:04.777
- On stage with me,

04:02.574 --> 04:04.777
I brought three band mates

04:04.877 --> 04:06.780
from my home state

04:04.877 --> 04:06.780
of West Virginia.

04:06.879 --> 04:08.247
- Here we go, everybody.

04:06.879 --> 04:08.247
Stand by.

04:08.348 --> 04:09.716
- This is a big moment

04:08.348 --> 04:09.716
in my career.

04:09.816 --> 04:12.451
I'm gonna prove that

04:09.816 --> 04:12.451
I am the King of Country.

04:12.551 --> 04:14.554
And as soon as I put

04:12.551 --> 04:14.554
that hat on,

04:14.653 --> 04:16.622
it's game time, baby.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.591
[cheers and applause]

04:25.365 --> 04:27.199
- It's Tim McGraw!

04:31.670 --> 04:34.473
* It was Labor Day weekend

04:31.670 --> 04:34.473
I was 17 *

04:34.574 --> 04:35.475
- Whoo!

04:35.574 --> 04:38.779

04:35.574 --> 04:38.779

04:38.110 --> 04:41.447

04:38.110 --> 04:41.447
to the county fair *

04:41.548 --> 04:43.615
[laughter]

04:43.716 --> 04:45.851
* When I saw her

04:43.716 --> 04:45.851
for the first time *

04:45.951 --> 04:49.521
* She was standing there

04:45.951 --> 04:49.521
in the ticket line *

04:49.622 --> 04:53.930
* And it all started

04:49.622 --> 04:53.930
right then and there *

04:54.293 --> 04:57.764
* Oh a sailor sky made

04:54.293 --> 04:57.764
a perfect sunset *

04:57.863 --> 04:59.865
* And that's the day

04:57.863 --> 04:59.865
I'll never forget *

05:00.329 --> 05:02.802
* I had a barbecue stain

05:00.329 --> 05:02.802
on my white T-shirt *

05:02.901 --> 05:06.206
* She was killing me

05:02.901 --> 05:06.206
in that miniskirt *

05:06.305 --> 05:07.607
* Skippin' rocks

05:06.305 --> 05:07.607
on the river *

05:07.706 --> 05:10.810
* by the railroad tracks

05:10.910 --> 05:14.314
* She had a suntan line

05:10.910 --> 05:14.314
and red lipstick *

05:14.413 --> 05:16.915
* I worked so hard

05:14.413 --> 05:16.915
for that first kiss *

05:17.500 --> 05:19.552
* And a heart don't forget

05:19.651 --> 05:22.550
* No And a heart

05:19.651 --> 05:22.550
don't forget *

05:22.122 --> 05:26.589
* I said And a heart don't

05:22.122 --> 05:26.589

05:29.129 --> 05:32.231
* No not somethin'

05:29.129 --> 05:32.231

05:38.303 --> 05:40.939
[cheers and applause]

05:41.740 --> 05:43.175
- Hey, good God.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.848
- Keep it goin'.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.848
Keep it goin'.

05:48.947 --> 05:52.850
Yes.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.387
Adam, how you feelin'

05:52.185 --> 05:54.387
right now?

05:54.487 --> 05:56.456
- Yeah, I thought that was

05:54.487 --> 05:56.456
a really fun performance.

05:56.555 --> 05:57.824
You're very charismatic.

05:57.923 --> 05:59.391
The band is amazing.

05:59.492 --> 06:01.528
Um, and what we love

05:59.492 --> 06:01.528
about Tim McGraw

06:01.627 --> 06:03.228
is that he's really

06:01.627 --> 06:03.228
connected with his fans

06:03.329 --> 06:04.297
in the audience.

06:05.464 --> 06:06.932
And you were giving everybody,

06:05.464 --> 06:06.932
like, some-some energy,

06:07.329 --> 06:09.336
even us, pointing as us,

06:07.329 --> 06:09.336
playing with us.

06:09.435 --> 06:10.603
It was great.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.730
[cheers and applause]

06:10.704 --> 06:13.730
- Thank you.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.908
- Ester, how we feelin' about

06:13.173 --> 06:14.908
this performance right now?

06:15.410 --> 06:16.675
- I'm just hot right now.

06:15.410 --> 06:16.675
So, anyway.

06:16.776 --> 06:18.944
- [indistinct], yeah.

06:19.449 --> 06:20.379
- You know what?

06:19.449 --> 06:20.379
That's how I feel.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.682
I feel like I'm watching

06:20.480 --> 06:23.682
the summer concert

06:23.783 --> 06:25.617
in Nashville right now.

06:25.718 --> 06:26.786
I'm like watching him, like,

06:26.886 --> 06:29.221
"Hey, he look like Tim

06:26.886 --> 06:29.221
to me," you know?

06:29.322 --> 06:31.423
So...

06:29.322 --> 06:31.423
- Thank you.

06:31.524 --> 06:33.726
- Meghan, how you

06:31.524 --> 06:33.726

- Thank you.

06:40.659 --> 06:41.500
- Yeah.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.269
- That's hard to

06:41.600 --> 06:43.269
bulk up like that.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.437
You look incredible.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.437
- Thank you.

06:45.538 --> 06:47.574

06:45.538 --> 06:47.574

I think if anything, if we

06:47.673 --> 06:50.576

06:50.677 --> 06:52.778
I would love to send you

06:52.879 --> 06:54.613
is great,

06:54.713 --> 06:56.716
but it's almost a little

06:54.713 --> 06:56.716
too much twang,

06:56.816 --> 06:59.218
where I can't really

06:56.816 --> 06:59.218
understand what you're saying.

06:59.319 --> 07:03.889
And your movement on stage,

06:59.319 --> 07:03.889
it's a little bit tight.

07:03.189 --> 07:05.658
So I really wanna get you

07:03.189 --> 07:05.658
with our movement expert.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.726
And you're gonna be

07:05.759 --> 07:07.726
above and beyond.

07:07.826 --> 07:10.300
[cheers and applause]

07:07.826 --> 07:10.300
- Thank you.

07:11.398 --> 07:13.329
- I mean, how you feelin'

07:11.398 --> 07:13.329
right now, man?

07:13.660 --> 07:13.899
- Feelin' great.

07:14.339 --> 07:15.268
I-I'm ready for

07:14.339 --> 07:15.268
the Battle Round, man.

07:15.367 --> 07:16.536
Let's get to it.

07:15.367 --> 07:16.536
- Okay.

07:16.636 --> 07:18.379
- I ain't kiddin'.

07:16.636 --> 07:18.379
- I love that energy.

07:18.709 --> 07:19.238
I like that.

07:19.338 --> 07:21.875
When we come back,

07:19.338 --> 07:21.875
we will meet the competition.

07:22.420 --> 07:23.610
He's a family man

07:22.420 --> 07:23.610
from Virginia

07:23.709 --> 07:26.278
whose day job fits

07:23.709 --> 07:26.278
right into his tribute.

07:26.379 --> 07:27.846
I'ma go to the gym.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.500
[cheers and applause]

07:27.947 --> 07:30.500
- Yeah.

07:31.850 --> 07:33.218
- Coming up...

07:36.288 --> 07:37.490
- I love Keith Urban,

07:45.365 --> 07:49.468
**

07:50.470 --> 07:51.603
- Welcome back to

07:50.470 --> 07:51.603
Clash of the Cover Bands.

07:51.704 --> 07:54.173
Our next tribute artist is

07:51.704 --> 07:54.173
a family man from Virginia

07:54.274 --> 07:56.909
whose day job fits

07:54.274 --> 07:56.909
right into his tribute.

07:57.769 --> 07:58.745
Check this out.

07:59.778 --> 08:02.480
- My name is Adam Rutledge.

07:59.778 --> 08:02.480
I'm 40 years old.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.916
And I've paid tribute

08:02.148 --> 08:03.916
to Keith Urban.

08:04.170 --> 08:05.250
- Pass.

08:05.351 --> 08:06.720
- By day, I'm

08:05.351 --> 08:06.720
a stay-at-home dad.

08:06.819 --> 08:07.821
- Okay.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.588
- I'm taking kids to school,

08:07.920 --> 08:09.588
picking 'em up.

08:09.689 --> 08:10.723
- Come on, bro.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.658
- My beautiful wife, Kelly.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.326
We're gonna cook

08:12.759 --> 08:14.326
some breakfast.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.862
- At night and on the weekends,

08:14.427 --> 08:16.862
I'm rockin' out somewhere.

08:18.731 --> 08:20.800
- I grew up, um,

08:18.731 --> 08:20.800
my dad was in bands,

08:20.899 --> 08:23.360
uh, and from the time

08:20.899 --> 08:23.360
I can remember,

08:23.103 --> 08:25.538
and then I had a rock band

08:23.103 --> 08:25.538
for about 10 years.

08:25.637 --> 08:27.399
- I don't know if I'm gonna

08:25.637 --> 08:27.399
do that on stage.

08:27.139 --> 08:28.908
If I do that on TV,

08:27.139 --> 08:28.908
we're in trouble.

08:29.420 --> 08:30.776
- Tribute act's a pretty

08:29.420 --> 08:30.776
recent thing for me,

08:30.877 --> 08:33.460
and what got me

08:30.877 --> 08:33.460
into Keith Urban

08:33.789 --> 08:34.447
was his guitar playing.

08:34.547 --> 08:37.500
Not every artist

08:34.547 --> 08:37.500
plays the way he plays.

08:38.485 --> 08:41.587
Performing with me, I've got

08:38.485 --> 08:41.587
my band, Chris and Andy.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.591
Those guys are-are

08:42.522 --> 08:45.591
family to me.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.259
About to transform

08:45.692 --> 08:47.259
and go on stage.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.495
Just wanted to call

08:47.360 --> 08:48.495
and say I love you.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.960
- Good luck, babe.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.960
I love you.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.499
- My wife loves that I'm

08:50.196 --> 08:52.499
performing as this artist.

08:52.599 --> 08:54.669
You know, he's

08:52.599 --> 08:54.669
a good looking guy.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.335
I get a little better

08:54.100 --> 08:55.335
lookin' probably

08:55.434 --> 08:57.136
when I put

08:55.434 --> 08:57.136
the wig on, too.

08:57.236 --> 08:59.720
- Here we go, everybody.

08:57.236 --> 08:59.720
Stand by.

08:59.105 --> 09:01.374
- Ten seconds, here we go.

09:01.474 --> 09:04.100
- When I get on that stage,

09:01.474 --> 09:04.100
some nerves will kick in,

09:04.110 --> 09:05.778
but you gotta keep

09:04.110 --> 09:05.778
followin' your dream.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.413
You know, if you stay at

09:05.879 --> 09:07.413
the table long enough,

09:07.514 --> 09:08.847
eventually you'll eat.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.116
[cheers and applause]

09:12.351 --> 09:17.923
**

09:18.240 --> 09:20.192
- Yeah, it's Keith Urban!

09:20.293 --> 09:24.663
* And I'm lettin' go of

09:20.293 --> 09:24.663
all my lonely yesterdays *

09:24.764 --> 09:28.768
* I've forgiven myself

09:24.764 --> 09:28.768
for the mistakes I've made *

09:28.868 --> 09:31.471
* Now there's just

09:28.868 --> 09:31.471
one thing *

09:31.571 --> 09:34.173
* The only thing

09:31.571 --> 09:34.173
I wanna do *

09:35.274 --> 09:37.344
- That's what he does.

09:35.274 --> 09:37.344
He goes...

09:37.443 --> 09:40.460
* I wanna love somebody

09:40.799 --> 09:42.881
* love somebody like you

09:45.317 --> 09:48.654
* Yeah I wanna feel

09:45.317 --> 09:48.654
the sunshine *

09:48.754 --> 09:51.390
* Shinin' down on

09:48.754 --> 09:51.390
me and you *

09:53.927 --> 09:57.197
* When you put your arms

09:53.927 --> 09:57.197
around me *

09:57.297 --> 09:58.530
* You let me know

09:57.297 --> 09:58.530
there's *

09:58.630 --> 10:02.534
* nothing in this world

09:58.630 --> 10:02.534
I can't do *

10:05.605 --> 10:10.429
* I used to run in circles

10:05.605 --> 10:10.429
goin' no where fast *

10:10.143 --> 10:14.799
* I'd take a one step forward

10:10.143 --> 10:14.799
and a two steps back *

10:14.179 --> 10:16.816
* I couldn't walk

10:14.179 --> 10:16.816
a straight line *

10:16.916 --> 10:19.318
* Even if I wanted to

10:22.688 --> 10:25.325
* I wanna love somebody

10:25.424 --> 10:28.260
* love somebody like you

10:30.163 --> 10:31.931
* Whoa here we go now

10:32.649 --> 10:42.750
**

10:42.107 --> 10:47.246
**

10:59.225 --> 11:03.663
[cheers and applause]

11:03.763 --> 11:05.498
- Whoo!

11:05.597 --> 11:07.500
- Let's hear it for

11:05.597 --> 11:07.500
Adam Rutledge

11:07.600 --> 11:09.668
and the Keith Urban tribute,

11:07.600 --> 11:09.668
let's go.

11:09.769 --> 11:15.240
[cheers and applause]

11:15.341 --> 11:16.942
So, Meghan?

11:17.769 --> 11:19.278
- I love country music.

11:17.769 --> 11:19.278
I love Keith Urban,

11:19.379 --> 11:22.381
so I'm so excited

11:19.379 --> 11:22.381
for this right now.

11:22.481 --> 11:25.384
As you know, we're looking

11:22.481 --> 11:25.384
for vocal impressions,

11:25.485 --> 11:28.822
physical embodiment,

11:25.485 --> 11:28.822
and overall performance.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.524
I feel like you're so close,

11:28.922 --> 11:31.524
but I hear nerves

11:31.624 --> 11:33.393
and I also see that

11:31.624 --> 11:33.393
in the performance.

11:33.493 --> 11:34.961
And I know

11:33.493 --> 11:34.961
Keith Urban's smiling,

11:35.950 --> 11:36.730
having the best

11:35.950 --> 11:36.730
time of his life.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.990
I just wanted a little more

11:36.830 --> 11:39.990
like you're enjoying yourself.

11:39.164 --> 11:40.633
But I know how passionate

11:39.164 --> 11:40.633
you are about this

11:40.734 --> 11:43.102
and I love that

11:40.734 --> 11:43.102
and the band.

11:43.168 --> 11:44.336
You all killed it.

11:43.168 --> 11:44.336
Good job.

11:44.437 --> 11:47.941
[cheers and applause]

11:48.107 --> 11:49.408
- Ester, how you feeling?

11:49.509 --> 11:51.711
- You know what, I love

11:49.509 --> 11:51.711
seeing all type of genres

11:51.811 --> 11:53.446
of music 'cause

11:51.811 --> 11:53.446
I'm a songwriter,

11:53.546 --> 11:54.913
so it's my job

11:53.546 --> 11:54.913
to, you know,

11:55.149 --> 11:56.615
catch on and understand.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.485
I love the fact that

11:56.716 --> 11:59.485
you look like Keith,

11:59.586 --> 12:01.587
but next time

11:59.586 --> 12:01.587
I want you to just

12:01.687 --> 12:03.188
rock out, rock out,

12:01.687 --> 12:03.188
rock out.

12:03.288 --> 12:05.580
And I wanna

12:03.288 --> 12:05.580
close my eyes,

12:05.158 --> 12:07.559
I wanna feel in

12:05.158 --> 12:07.559
my spirit that I got Keith.

12:07.659 --> 12:09.620
Give me Keith.

12:07.659 --> 12:09.620
- Give me Keith.

12:09.950 --> 12:12.532
- There you go.

12:09.950 --> 12:12.532
- Exactly, exactly.

12:12.631 --> 12:14.167
- Adam, how you feeling?

12:14.267 --> 12:15.735
- You know, what we have on

12:14.267 --> 12:15.735
the show that's so exciting

12:15.835 --> 12:18.203
is we have access to

12:15.835 --> 12:18.203
the best of the best

12:18.303 --> 12:20.407
in the business

12:18.303 --> 12:20.407
behind the scenes.

12:20.506 --> 12:21.908
You're really

12:20.506 --> 12:21.908
natural up there.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.244
You got the pipes, you got

12:22.750 --> 12:24.244
the hair, but what we're

12:24.344 --> 12:26.613
saying is, like, if you just,

12:24.344 --> 12:26.613
like, got even more solid

12:26.712 --> 12:29.215
in the vocals and come off

12:26.712 --> 12:29.215
a little more confident.

12:29.315 --> 12:30.850
I think that would

12:29.315 --> 12:30.850
be really cool.

12:30.950 --> 12:32.284
So, we would like

12:30.950 --> 12:32.284
to pair you

12:32.384 --> 12:34.821
with our movement

12:32.384 --> 12:34.821
and vocal experts.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.255
I mean, there's always

12:34.921 --> 12:36.255
room to get better.

12:36.355 --> 12:37.356
I'm always trying

12:36.355 --> 12:37.356
to get better.

12:37.456 --> 12:38.991
- Absolutely,

12:37.456 --> 12:38.991
that sounds great.

12:39.919 --> 12:40.293
- It's a thing that

12:39.919 --> 12:40.293
we Adams have in common,

12:40.393 --> 12:41.226
we're striving

12:40.393 --> 12:41.226
for the best.

12:41.326 --> 12:42.227
- That's right,

12:41.326 --> 12:42.227
that's right.

12:42.327 --> 12:44.798
- Yeah.

12:42.327 --> 12:44.798
- Let me ask you something.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.100
After hearing that, does it

12:44.898 --> 12:47.100
feel different performing

12:47.167 --> 12:49.101
on this kind of

12:47.167 --> 12:49.101
stage comparatively

12:49.134 --> 12:51.971
to where you usually are?

12:49.134 --> 12:51.971
- Yeah, absolutely.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.773
We're from a small town in

12:52.105 --> 12:53.773
Virginia, so this is like--

12:53.873 --> 12:55.575
- Oh, wow!

12:53.873 --> 12:55.575
- Virginia.

12:55.674 --> 12:56.842
- It was a whole

12:55.674 --> 12:56.842
other world here.

12:56.942 --> 12:57.844
- There you go.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.278
You're getting the whole

12:57.943 --> 12:59.278
Hollywood treatment.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.379
Wow, I like that.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.379
- Hollywood!

13:00.480 --> 13:03.249
We're here to help you.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.249
- Now, when we come back,

13:03.350 --> 13:05.150
both of these country

13:03.350 --> 13:05.150
kings will get ready for

13:05.250 --> 13:08.355
the battle round with some

13:05.250 --> 13:08.355
help from our Clash experts.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.221
So don't go anywhere.

13:10.899 --> 13:13.590
[cheers and applause]

13:10.899 --> 13:13.590
- Coming up...

13:13.125 --> 13:15.662
* Labor Day weekend

13:13.125 --> 13:15.662
I was 17 *

13:15.761 --> 13:17.163
- I'm not asking

13:15.761 --> 13:17.163
for less energy.

13:17.263 --> 13:18.597
- Right.

13:17.263 --> 13:18.597
- Let's just channel the energy

13:18.697 --> 13:20.667
differently so it feels

13:18.697 --> 13:20.667
a bit more streamlined.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.470
- Got it.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.470
- Not lettin' go of--

13:23.570 --> 13:25.504
- Stop.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.504
Enunciate.

13:25.605 --> 13:28.107
* I wanna love somebody

13:35.148 --> 13:37.683
**

13:38.985 --> 13:39.818
- I'm about to go in here and

13:38.985 --> 13:39.818
meet with the Clash experts.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.621
I'ma learn as much as I can

13:40.820 --> 13:42.621
and put it to use

13:42.721 --> 13:45.909
in the battle round,

13:42.721 --> 13:45.909
try to go win this thing.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.692
- Hey!

13:45.125 --> 13:46.692
- Hey, what's up?

13:46.793 --> 13:48.227
- How you doin', man?

13:46.793 --> 13:48.227
- Good, how are you guys?

13:48.327 --> 13:49.461
- Doin' amazing.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.461
- We're good.

13:49.562 --> 13:50.730
- Great to meet you, brother.

13:49.562 --> 13:50.730
- Great to meet you.

13:50.830 --> 13:51.998
- What's goin' on?

13:50.830 --> 13:51.998
- Nice to meet you.

13:52.980 --> 13:53.399
- You look exactly

13:52.980 --> 13:53.399
like Keith Urban.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.235
It's unbelievable.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.235
- Absolutely, 100%.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.299
- Thank you.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.299
I've never done anything

13:57.102 --> 13:58.672
like this,

13:57.102 --> 13:58.672
havin' experts guide me.

13:58.772 --> 14:00.807
You know, I'm from

13:58.772 --> 14:00.807
a small town, so this is a--

14:00.907 --> 14:02.107
this is a once in

14:00.907 --> 14:02.107
a lifetime experience.

14:02.207 --> 14:02.942
I can't wait.

14:03.429 --> 14:05.477
* I wanna love somebody

14:05.577 --> 14:09.490
* Love somebody like you

14:09.149 --> 14:10.500
- I feel like

14:09.149 --> 14:10.500
you're so close,

14:10.115 --> 14:12.686
but I hear nerves

14:10.115 --> 14:12.686
and I also see that

14:12.785 --> 14:13.519
in the performance.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.321
And I know

14:13.620 --> 14:15.321
Keith Urban's smiling,

14:15.422 --> 14:16.355
having the best

14:15.422 --> 14:16.355
time of his life.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.192
I just wanted a little more

14:17.590 --> 14:19.192
like you're enjoying yourself.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.940
- Are you typically

14:19.292 --> 14:21.940
always nervous or--

14:21.193 --> 14:22.761
- Typically not,

14:21.193 --> 14:22.761
but it's just like--

14:22.861 --> 14:24.463
it was just so

14:22.861 --> 14:24.463
much happenin'.

14:24.563 --> 14:25.865
- So much happenin', yeah.

14:24.563 --> 14:25.865
- It's chaos.

14:25.965 --> 14:27.801
- It's so different from, like,

14:25.965 --> 14:27.801
normal shows that I do.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.202
It's nerves and a lot of

14:27.900 --> 14:30.202
adrenaline all there,

14:30.302 --> 14:31.403
right there at one time.

14:30.302 --> 14:31.403
- Yeah.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.139
- One thing that I noticed

14:31.504 --> 14:33.139
that was great about you,

14:33.239 --> 14:36.676
when you play guitar

14:33.239 --> 14:36.676
you were extremely confident.

14:36.775 --> 14:38.577
We have to get the confidence

14:36.775 --> 14:38.577
that you have

14:38.677 --> 14:40.746
as a guitarist as a vocalist.

14:38.677 --> 14:40.746
- Right.

14:40.846 --> 14:42.820
- We're gonna bring those

14:40.846 --> 14:42.820
two things together.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.649
Let's bring in your band.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.649
- Let's go.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.284
- Hey!

14:45.384 --> 14:46.919
- What's up, fellas?

14:45.384 --> 14:46.919
What's your name?

14:47.870 --> 14:47.986
- Andy.

14:47.870 --> 14:47.986
- Andy?

14:48.879 --> 14:49.154
- Chris.

14:49.254 --> 14:50.190
- Andy and-- right,

14:49.254 --> 14:50.190
nice to meet you.

14:50.289 --> 14:51.290
- Cool.

14:50.289 --> 14:51.290
- Chris.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.459
- Nice to meet you guys.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.459
- Nice to meet you, too.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.625
- Okay, let's do this thing.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.625
I'm excited.

14:53.726 --> 14:54.760
- Let's go.

14:53.726 --> 14:54.760
- All right, let's do it.

14:54.860 --> 14:57.463
- Adam does look just

14:54.860 --> 14:57.463
like Keith and it's cool.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.166
- But Adam as Keith needs to

14:57.563 --> 15:00.166
have more fun being Keith.

15:00.265 --> 15:01.600
- Yes, yes.

15:00.265 --> 15:01.600
Sing, like, a couple of

15:01.701 --> 15:03.870
bars of the first verse.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.870
- All right.

15:04.370 --> 15:07.399
* Not lettin' go of

15:04.370 --> 15:07.399
all my lonely *

15:07.106 --> 15:10.342
- Stop.

15:07.106 --> 15:10.342
Now, enunciate.

15:10.442 --> 15:13.846
Not lettin' go--

15:10.442 --> 15:13.846
Everything is on purpose.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.615
Like, when you play

15:13.947 --> 15:15.615
you're not playing

15:15.715 --> 15:17.216
in between threads.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.216
- Right.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.951
- 'Cause if you play in

15:17.317 --> 15:18.951
between threads

15:19.519 --> 15:20.286
it's noisy, right?

15:19.519 --> 15:20.286
- Sure.

15:20.386 --> 15:23.722
- So, when you sing,

15:20.386 --> 15:23.722
if you sing it on purpose

15:23.822 --> 15:25.958
it'll have

15:23.822 --> 15:25.958
a different intensity.

15:26.590 --> 15:26.826
- Okay.

15:26.590 --> 15:26.826
- All right?

15:27.793 --> 15:28.528
- I'm listening.

15:27.793 --> 15:28.528
- So now, move your mouth--

15:28.628 --> 15:30.163
Not lettin'--

15:30.263 --> 15:34.533
* Not lettin' go of

15:30.263 --> 15:34.533
all my lonely yesterdays *

15:34.634 --> 15:36.690
- Yes!

15:34.634 --> 15:36.690
- That's great.

15:36.101 --> 15:39.338
Now, we're feeling the fact

15:36.101 --> 15:39.338
that you understand the lyrics

15:39.438 --> 15:41.640
that you're singing

15:39.438 --> 15:41.640
and you're putting life

15:41.740 --> 15:43.809
behind every single

15:41.740 --> 15:43.809
one of those words.

15:43.909 --> 15:45.644
- Now, that's great 'cause

15:43.909 --> 15:45.644
when I get nervous the first

15:45.745 --> 15:47.346
thing I-- I kinda shrink

15:45.745 --> 15:47.346
down my-my movement.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.515
- Exactly. Sing to those

15:47.447 --> 15:49.515
judges next time.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.418
Now, I'm gonna put

15:49.615 --> 15:51.418
it over to you.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.852
- 'Cause what's happening

15:51.518 --> 15:53.852
now is the body's

15:53.952 --> 15:54.788
starting to work.

15:53.952 --> 15:54.788
- Exactly.

15:54.888 --> 15:57.322
- The physicality that

15:54.888 --> 15:57.322
Keith Urban has

15:57.423 --> 15:59.292
we need to bring

15:57.423 --> 15:59.292
to Adam today.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.628
Chest is lifted,

15:59.392 --> 16:01.628
engage the audience,

16:01.727 --> 16:04.297
and engage the fans.

16:01.727 --> 16:04.297
Perform for a reason.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.166
So we want the audience

16:04.397 --> 16:06.166
to lean in.

16:06.265 --> 16:07.333
- Make 'em lean in,

16:06.265 --> 16:07.333
I love that.

16:07.433 --> 16:09.836
- Once you feel the audience

16:07.433 --> 16:09.836
start to lean back,

16:09.936 --> 16:11.370
you have to

16:09.936 --> 16:11.370
jump right in.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.306
This is the battle of

16:11.471 --> 16:13.306
the kings of country

16:13.405 --> 16:14.807
so you gotta get on

16:13.405 --> 16:14.807
the throne, let's go.

16:14.908 --> 16:15.741
- Yeah.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.846
* Not lettin' go of all

16:16.809 --> 16:19.846
my lonely yesterdays *

16:19.946 --> 16:20.746
- Keep goin'.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.883
* I've forgiven myself for

16:21.880 --> 16:23.883
the mistakes I've made *

16:24.500 --> 16:24.650
- Relax.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.153
And who is it,

16:25.485 --> 16:27.153
who you singing to?

16:27.253 --> 16:29.889
- My wife. She's

16:27.253 --> 16:29.889
my high school sweetheart.

16:29.188 --> 16:31.291
We've been together for

16:29.188 --> 16:31.291
a long time, so for her.

16:31.390 --> 16:32.692
- Oh, man, that's a--

16:31.390 --> 16:32.692
that's incredible.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.827
When you sing, make sure

16:32.792 --> 16:34.827
you-you have that

16:34.927 --> 16:35.894
as your inspiration.

16:36.620 --> 16:36.929
- And the audience

16:36.620 --> 16:36.929
will feel it.

16:37.629 --> 16:38.398
- Absolutely.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.966
- Now that there's more

16:38.498 --> 16:40.966
awareness here, let's do it.

16:41.669 --> 16:42.802
- Let's pull it together.

16:41.669 --> 16:42.802
- Let's count him in.

16:42.902 --> 16:43.903
- Okay.

16:42.902 --> 16:43.903
- Let's-let's help him out.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.538
All right, right, so, uh,

16:44.700 --> 16:46.538
Chris, take your sticks--

16:46.639 --> 16:49.642
un, un-- and let's do it.

16:46.639 --> 16:49.642
One, two, three.

16:49.743 --> 16:53.513
* One step forward

16:49.743 --> 16:53.513
and two steps back *

16:53.613 --> 16:54.447
- All that

16:53.613 --> 16:54.447
body stuff is it.

16:54.547 --> 16:55.849
* I couldn't walk

16:54.547 --> 16:55.849
a straight line *

16:55.948 --> 16:57.850
- That's it!

16:55.948 --> 16:57.850
- I mean, from the first moment

16:57.951 --> 16:59.852
he walked in,

16:57.951 --> 16:59.852
Adam worked with us,

17:00.200 --> 17:02.355
took the notes really,

17:00.200 --> 17:02.355
really quickly.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.790
* I wanna love somebody

17:04.891 --> 17:07.926
* Love somebody like you

17:08.279 --> 17:12.898
- Love it.

17:08.279 --> 17:12.898
- Yes!

17:13.329 --> 17:14.834
- That's the vibes.

17:13.329 --> 17:14.834
- That's so much better.

17:14.933 --> 17:17.336
- I love your energy.

17:14.933 --> 17:17.336
Your confidence was there

17:17.436 --> 17:19.439
and you were

17:17.436 --> 17:19.439
having fun with it.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.607
- Even in this small

17:19.538 --> 17:21.607
session I feel myself

17:21.708 --> 17:22.709
growing immensely.

17:22.808 --> 17:25.310
I think in order to beat

17:22.808 --> 17:25.310
Adam I'm gonna have to

17:25.412 --> 17:27.180
settle my nerves and get

17:25.412 --> 17:27.180
out there and do what

17:27.279 --> 17:28.781
the coaches told me to do

17:27.279 --> 17:28.781
and just go for it

17:28.882 --> 17:30.150
and really sell it,

17:28.882 --> 17:30.150
have fun.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.284
- Congratulations,

17:30.250 --> 17:31.284
great job!

17:31.384 --> 17:32.585
- Thank you so much.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.585
Thank you so much.

17:32.685 --> 17:33.853
- I feel like you picked up

17:32.685 --> 17:33.853
everything greatly.

17:33.952 --> 17:36.559
- Thank you so much.

17:33.952 --> 17:36.559
- Excellent job, my friend.

17:36.690 --> 17:38.124
- Hey, buddy.

17:36.690 --> 17:38.124
- Hey, what's up, man?

17:38.223 --> 17:39.589
- How you doin'?

17:40.599 --> 17:40.759
- It's so nice to meet

17:40.599 --> 17:40.759
you guys, finally, man.

17:40.859 --> 17:41.661
- Nice to meet you.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.461
- Ray, very nice

17:41.760 --> 17:42.461
to meet you, man.

17:42.561 --> 17:43.296
- Thank you.

17:44.329 --> 17:44.763
- So happy to be here

17:44.329 --> 17:44.763
with you guys. Thank you.

17:45.765 --> 17:46.566
- We're excited to be

17:45.765 --> 17:46.566
able to work with you.

17:47.599 --> 17:49.568
* I had a barbecue stain

17:47.599 --> 17:49.568
on my white t-shirt *

17:49.669 --> 17:52.806
* She was killing me

17:49.669 --> 17:52.806
in that miniskirt *

17:52.905 --> 17:54.273
* Skipping rocks

17:52.905 --> 17:54.273
on the river *

17:54.374 --> 17:57.576
* by the railroad tracks

17:57.676 --> 17:59.746
- It was almost a little

17:57.676 --> 17:59.746
too much twang,

17:59.846 --> 18:02.147
where I can't really

17:59.846 --> 18:02.147
understand what you're saying.

18:02.248 --> 18:05.117
Your movement on stage

18:02.248 --> 18:05.117
is a little bit tight.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.869
- I think just getting

18:05.218 --> 18:07.869
you to just relax.

18:07.186 --> 18:08.210
- Yeah.

18:09.220 --> 18:09.622
- And just sing how you do

18:09.220 --> 18:09.622
your speaking voice.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.240
- Right.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.240
- And then, we'll move on

18:12.258 --> 18:12.726
to some movement, jump around

18:12.258 --> 18:12.726
a little bit, have some fun.

18:12.826 --> 18:13.759
- Sounds great, man.

18:14.827 --> 18:15.194
- Um, but we're missing

18:14.827 --> 18:15.194
some people, I think, so.

18:16.289 --> 18:16.328
- Yeah, let's

18:16.289 --> 18:16.328
bring the band in.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.330
- The band.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.330
- There they are.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.398
- All West Virginians here.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.201
Eighteen years I've

18:19.499 --> 18:21.201
been with this guy.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.134
- Really?

18:23.169 --> 18:23.369
- He's been with me for

18:23.169 --> 18:23.369
18 years, off and on.

18:23.836 --> 18:24.304
- Eighteen years?

18:25.337 --> 18:26.105
- I've been doing my thing

18:25.337 --> 18:26.105
for a long time now,

18:27.400 --> 18:28.141
but I haven't had a lot

18:27.400 --> 18:28.141
of instruction.

18:28.240 --> 18:31.176
I just took it and ran

18:28.240 --> 18:31.176
with it, so I'm excited

18:31.277 --> 18:33.579
to incorporate what

18:31.277 --> 18:33.579
they tell me to do.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.781
- Sing the first

18:33.680 --> 18:35.781
line for me.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.839
* It was Labor Day weekend

18:35.882 --> 18:38.839
I was 17 *

18:38.183 --> 18:39.486
- There you go.

18:39.586 --> 18:42.721
- It was Labor Day weekend

18:39.586 --> 18:42.721
I was 17--

18:42.822 --> 18:43.722
like, put the twang there.

18:43.823 --> 18:44.723
- Okay.

18:43.823 --> 18:44.723
- Pick your places.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.593
- All right.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.593
- Let's do some more.

18:46.692 --> 18:50.630
* It was Labor Day weekend

18:46.692 --> 18:50.630
I was 17 *

18:50.960 --> 18:52.932
* I bought a Coke

18:50.960 --> 18:52.932
and some gasoline *

18:53.660 --> 18:54.968
- Yeah, go soulful,

18:53.660 --> 18:54.968
so sweet.

18:55.680 --> 18:56.690
- It all started--

18:55.680 --> 18:56.690
- Nice!

18:57.170 --> 18:58.710
- Right then and there--

18:57.170 --> 18:58.710
- Hear-hear the difference?

18:58.171 --> 18:58.837
- Yeah.

18:59.806 --> 19:00.599
- Like, you-you're taking

18:59.806 --> 19:00.599
me in and out of--

19:01.141 --> 19:01.840
- Yeah, in and out, I'm

19:01.141 --> 19:01.840
definitely-- yeah, for sure.

19:02.909 --> 19:03.410
- Yeah, and it's giving me

19:02.909 --> 19:03.410
more passion because--

19:04.277 --> 19:04.411
- Instead of just

19:04.277 --> 19:04.411
coming right in it.

19:05.450 --> 19:05.450
- Yeah, yeah.

19:05.450 --> 19:06.378
- Okay.

19:06.378 --> 19:07.646
- All right, Tim, uh,

19:06.378 --> 19:07.646
uses props and stuff,

19:07.747 --> 19:10.150
so here we go.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.150
- All right.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.217
- You willing to

19:10.250 --> 19:11.217
play a little bit?

19:11.317 --> 19:13.920
- Yes, of course I am.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.920
- Could you actually

19:14.200 --> 19:15.355
jump over the chair?

19:14.200 --> 19:15.355
- Of course, easy.

19:15.454 --> 19:17.856
- He approaches everything

19:15.454 --> 19:17.856
like a linebacker.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.626
I know he has a football

19:18.240 --> 19:20.626
background, so movement-wise

19:20.727 --> 19:23.630
it's really important that

19:20.727 --> 19:23.630
he loosen up a little bit.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.299
- Okay.

19:25.309 --> 19:26.660
- So, if we build off

19:25.309 --> 19:26.660
of [indistinct], right?

19:26.165 --> 19:27.329
- Mm-hmm.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.134
- And how that's coming from

19:28.167 --> 19:29.134
the inside-out in vocals,

19:29.234 --> 19:30.603
how does that affect

19:29.234 --> 19:30.603
your physicality?

19:30.703 --> 19:32.172
- I'm more relaxed,

19:30.703 --> 19:32.172
more relaxed, yeah.

19:32.271 --> 19:35.407
- Yeah, more relaxed and

19:32.271 --> 19:35.407
it's-it's not less present.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.676
Let's just channel the energy

19:35.508 --> 19:37.676
differently so it feels

19:37.777 --> 19:39.846
a bit more streamlined.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.846
- Got it, got it.

19:39.945 --> 19:41.347
- Right, so we're not

19:39.945 --> 19:41.347
at 100% all the time.

19:41.448 --> 19:42.515
- Yeah, right.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.718
- And, here we go,

19:42.615 --> 19:44.718
two, three, four.

19:44.817 --> 19:47.921
* It was Labor Day weekend

19:44.817 --> 19:47.921
I was 17 *

19:48.539 --> 19:50.557
* I bought a Coke

19:48.539 --> 19:50.557
and some gasoline *

19:50.656 --> 19:52.826
- Now you can shift

19:50.656 --> 19:52.826
a little bit if you want.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.795
* Oh a sailor sky made

19:52.925 --> 19:55.795
a perfect sunset *

19:55.894 --> 19:56.663
- A little more.

19:57.630 --> 19:58.131
* And that's the day

19:57.630 --> 19:58.131
I'll never forget *

19:58.230 --> 19:59.566
- All right, you got it.

19:59.665 --> 20:01.567
* I had a barbecue stain

19:59.665 --> 20:01.567
on my white t-shirt *

20:01.667 --> 20:04.871
* She was killing me

20:01.667 --> 20:04.871
in that miniskirt *

20:04.971 --> 20:06.138
* Skipping rocks

20:04.971 --> 20:06.138
on the river *

20:06.239 --> 20:07.272
* By the railroad

20:07.374 --> 20:08.842
- See, I love that.

20:08.942 --> 20:10.710
Actually, can you jump

20:08.942 --> 20:10.710
from that position

20:10.809 --> 20:12.746
onto your feet, onto

20:10.809 --> 20:12.746
the seat of the chair?

20:12.846 --> 20:13.846
- Come on, yeah.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.315
- Yes, I'll count you in

20:13.946 --> 20:15.315
and I'll spot you.

20:15.414 --> 20:16.682
You ready?

20:15.414 --> 20:16.682
All right, here we go.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.884
- The spot.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.884
- Five, six, seven--

20:18.984 --> 20:20.319
- Hey.

20:18.984 --> 20:20.319
- Hey!

20:20.420 --> 20:22.689
- There we go.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.689
- There you go.

20:22.788 --> 20:25.392
- The one thing I would say

20:22.788 --> 20:25.392
be careful of is doing-doing

20:25.491 --> 20:28.940
stuff like that, once you get

20:25.491 --> 20:28.940
to that destination--

20:28.193 --> 20:29.461
- Yeah.

20:28.193 --> 20:29.461
- Don't let your adrenaline

20:29.561 --> 20:31.498
kick in, 'cause what'll happen

20:29.561 --> 20:31.498
is your adrenaline'll

20:31.597 --> 20:33.967
kick in and you'll just

20:31.597 --> 20:33.967
naturally go back to what's

20:34.670 --> 20:36.935
normal for you and that's over

20:34.670 --> 20:36.935
exaggerating the twang.

20:37.369 --> 20:38.672
- Right, okay. Right now,

20:37.369 --> 20:38.672
I'm learning so much.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.106
Just pull it back a little

20:38.771 --> 20:41.106
bit, be a little bit

20:41.207 --> 20:43.476
more myself, and it's

20:41.207 --> 20:43.476
gonna be a hit.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.789
- Between the two Adams,

20:43.576 --> 20:46.789
we got one who's nervous,

20:46.179 --> 20:47.614
you can see it.

20:47.713 --> 20:48.815
We got another one

20:47.713 --> 20:48.815
who's living up here.

20:48.914 --> 20:49.682
- Mm-hmm.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.684
- Maybe he's nervous and

20:50.650 --> 20:51.684
anxious too and just

20:51.785 --> 20:52.986
it comes out in

20:51.785 --> 20:52.986
a different way.

20:53.859 --> 20:54.988
And we just go like that.

20:55.822 --> 20:56.489
- Yeah, it's awesome.

20:55.880 --> 20:55.880
- Pleasure workin'

20:55.880 --> 20:57.323
with y'all.

20:57.323 --> 20:57.356
- I mean, so much,

20:57.323 --> 20:57.356
man, thank you.

20:58.258 --> 20:58.290
- Yes, an honor to

20:58.258 --> 20:58.290
meet you, no doubt.

20:59.291 --> 21:00.426
- Thank you very much.

20:59.291 --> 21:00.426
- Thank you, man. Yes.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.561
- Absolutely.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.561
- Thank you.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.364
- When I hit the stage

21:02.662 --> 21:04.364
they're gonna think,

21:04.463 --> 21:07.866
"Man, he is

21:04.463 --> 21:07.866
the king of country."

21:07.967 --> 21:09.635
- Coming up...

21:09.736 --> 21:11.570
* I may be a real bad--

21:11.671 --> 21:13.138
* Georgia--

21:13.239 --> 21:14.708
- Oh, my god.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.708
I'm like, "Wow."

21:14.807 --> 21:16.809
- Which one of

21:14.807 --> 21:16.809
these country kings

21:16.910 --> 21:18.978
reigned tonight?

21:27.354 --> 21:29.890
- One more time, give it up

21:27.354 --> 21:29.890
for both bands, guys.

21:30.900 --> 21:31.223
Give it up for both bands.

21:30.900 --> 21:31.223
Come on, here.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.192
- Yes, yes, y'all.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.192
It is battle time.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.295
How are you feeling?

21:33.292 --> 21:35.295
- I feel great.

21:35.394 --> 21:37.197
I been waiting on this

21:35.394 --> 21:37.197
all day long, man.

21:37.297 --> 21:38.298
- Oh, yeah? You about

21:37.297 --> 21:38.298
to bring the fire?

21:38.397 --> 21:39.365
- About to bring

21:38.397 --> 21:39.365
the fire, man.

21:39.465 --> 21:40.767
- How you feeling, man?

21:39.465 --> 21:40.767
- Let's sing, man.

21:40.866 --> 21:42.167
I'm ready to go.

21:42.268 --> 21:44.104
- This experience, I mean,

21:44.170 --> 21:45.305
it's something

21:44.170 --> 21:45.305
you really can't buy.

21:45.404 --> 21:46.873
I'm learning a lot.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.808
Now, I'm going out there

21:46.972 --> 21:49.808
tonight to prove

21:49.909 --> 21:51.211
that I am the king

21:49.909 --> 21:51.211
of country.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.130
[cheers and applause]

21:53.113 --> 21:54.114
- Yee-haw!

21:54.213 --> 21:55.647
- Yee-haw!

21:57.517 --> 21:59.685
- This is an opportunity

21:57.517 --> 21:59.685
for me to show

21:59.786 --> 22:01.755
I'm becoming

21:59.786 --> 22:01.755
a better Keith.

22:01.855 --> 22:03.923
Everything I sing,

22:01.855 --> 22:03.923
every movement,

22:04.569 --> 22:06.589
make it count.

22:04.569 --> 22:06.589
Everything matters.

22:06.159 --> 22:07.626
I'm ready for it.

22:07.727 --> 22:09.162
I'm going to leave it

22:07.727 --> 22:09.162
all on the stage.

22:09.261 --> 22:11.631
No regrets.

22:11.730 --> 22:14.233
- These two country tributes

22:11.730 --> 22:14.233
have really put in the effort.

22:14.334 --> 22:17.170
And now, it's time

22:14.334 --> 22:17.170
to battle.

22:17.269 --> 22:18.672
Let's go!

22:18.771 --> 22:20.807
- All right, battle rounds.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.807
Here we go!

22:20.906 --> 22:22.409
Who's gonna take it?

22:22.509 --> 22:24.277
- Here we go.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.277
Stand by.

22:28.981 --> 22:31.839
- Hey, Meghan,

22:28.981 --> 22:31.839
check it out.

22:33.686 --> 22:34.854
- Okay!

22:34.953 --> 22:38.657
* Girl you've never known

22:34.953 --> 22:38.657
no one like me *

22:38.758 --> 22:42.261
* Up there in

22:38.758 --> 22:42.261
your high society *

22:44.970 --> 22:46.633
* They might tell you

22:44.970 --> 22:46.633
I'm no good *

22:46.732 --> 22:50.869
* Girl they need

22:46.732 --> 22:50.869
to understand *

22:50.970 --> 22:54.606
* Just who I am

22:54.708 --> 22:59.612
* I may be a real bad boy

22:59.712 --> 23:03.650
* But baby

22:59.712 --> 23:03.650
I'm a real good man *

23:06.486 --> 23:10.323
* And the sun

23:06.486 --> 23:10.323
is shinin' *

23:10.423 --> 23:14.126
* This road's

23:10.423 --> 23:14.126
still windin' *

23:14.227 --> 23:16.528
* Through

23:14.227 --> 23:16.528
the prettiest country *

23:16.628 --> 23:19.231
* From Georgia

23:16.628 --> 23:19.231
to Tennessee *

23:22.434 --> 23:26.720
* And I got the one

23:22.434 --> 23:26.720
I love beside me *

23:26.105 --> 23:30.759
* My troubles behind me

23:30.175 --> 23:32.378
* I'm alive and I'm free

23:32.479 --> 23:35.414
* Who wouldn't

23:32.479 --> 23:35.414
want to be me *

23:37.450 --> 23:40.886
**

23:40.987 --> 23:43.222
* I said like it

23:40.987 --> 23:43.222
I love it *

23:43.323 --> 23:45.191
* I want some more of it

23:45.290 --> 23:48.827
* I try so hard

23:45.290 --> 23:48.827
I can't rise above it *

23:48.927 --> 23:52.798
* I don't know what it is

23:48.927 --> 23:52.798
'bout that little gal's lovin' *

23:52.898 --> 23:54.901
* But I like it

23:52.898 --> 23:54.901
I love it *

23:55.099 --> 23:57.299

Oh, come on, baby.

You know what I like.

24:04.844 --> 24:10.829

24:10.182 --> 24:13.385
- Oh!

24:10.182 --> 24:13.385
- Yeah!

24:13.486 --> 24:15.922
* Days go by

24:16.559 --> 24:17.490
* I can feel them flyin'

24:17.589 --> 24:20.660
* Like a hand out the window

24:17.589 --> 24:20.660
in the wind *

24:20.759 --> 24:22.828
* Cars go by

24:22.929 --> 24:24.698
* Yeah it's all

24:22.929 --> 24:24.698
we've been given *

24:24.798 --> 24:27.733
* You better start

24:24.798 --> 24:27.733
livin' right now *

24:27.834 --> 24:30.303
* 'Cause days go by

24:30.436 --> 24:35.442
**

24:35.541 --> 24:37.644
* Days go by

24:42.819 --> 24:43.982
- Yes.

24:44.116 --> 24:47.686
**

24:47.787 --> 24:50.900
* Hold the door

24:47.787 --> 24:50.900
say "please" *

24:50.123 --> 24:52.525
* say "thank you"

24:52.625 --> 24:56.628
* Don't steal don't cheat

24:52.625 --> 24:56.628
and don't lie *

24:56.730 --> 24:59.566
* I know you got

24:56.730 --> 24:59.566
mountains to climb *

24:59.665 --> 25:04.604
* But always stay

24:59.665 --> 25:04.604
humble and kind *

25:06.573 --> 25:09.275
* When the dreams

25:06.573 --> 25:09.275
you're dreamin' *

25:09.375 --> 25:10.276
* come to you

25:09.375 --> 25:10.276
- I like the vocals.

25:10.376 --> 25:11.810
- Yeah, I love

25:10.376 --> 25:11.810
everything about it.

25:11.911 --> 25:15.848
* When the work you

25:11.911 --> 25:15.848
put in is realized *

25:15.949 --> 25:18.484
* Let yourself

25:15.949 --> 25:18.484
feel the pride *

25:18.585 --> 25:22.321
* But always stay

25:18.585 --> 25:22.321
humble and kind *

25:24.857 --> 25:26.291
- Yeah!

25:33.732 --> 25:36.603
* And maybe it's

25:33.732 --> 25:36.603
a little too early *

25:36.702 --> 25:40.807
* To know if this

25:36.702 --> 25:40.807
is gonna work *

25:40.906 --> 25:44.978

25:49.315 --> 25:55.654
**

25:57.824 --> 25:59.792
- Yes! Yes!

25:59.893 --> 26:03.195
Yes, honey! Yes!

26:03.296 --> 26:05.164
- Let's go!

26:03.296 --> 26:05.164
- Woo-woo!

26:05.265 --> 26:06.766
- Give it up!

26:06.865 --> 26:08.367
It's the battle

26:06.865 --> 26:08.367
of the Adams.

26:08.468 --> 26:11.369
[cheers and applause]

26:11.104 --> 26:13.138
I feel how bad

26:11.104 --> 26:13.138
they wanted that.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.874
Did you see those

26:13.239 --> 26:14.874
little exchanges

26:15.410 --> 26:16.759
before every one of them

26:15.410 --> 26:16.759
got onstage?

26:16.175 --> 26:20.460
- Yes.

26:16.175 --> 26:20.460
- Those little...

26:20.799 --> 26:21.413
I mean, both of y'all

26:20.799 --> 26:21.413
brought it.

26:21.513 --> 26:23.349
All right, Ester.

26:21.513 --> 26:23.349
- Oh, my god.

26:23.450 --> 26:24.750
You guys are up here

26:23.450 --> 26:24.750
killing it.

26:24.851 --> 26:28.253
I'm like, "Wow!"

26:28.355 --> 26:31.191
I also got to work with

26:28.355 --> 26:31.191
Kuk the vocal expert,

26:31.290 --> 26:33.526
and what he did was show me

26:31.290 --> 26:33.526
how to feel music,

26:33.625 --> 26:35.194
and I felt

26:33.625 --> 26:35.194
the music tonight.

26:35.295 --> 26:37.630
It showed you studied.

26:37.163 --> 26:39.132
It showed you listened

26:37.163 --> 26:39.132
to our experts,

26:39.231 --> 26:40.599
and then brought it

26:39.231 --> 26:40.599
to the stage,

26:40.700 --> 26:42.368
so I just thank you

26:40.700 --> 26:42.368
for that.

26:42.469 --> 26:45.805
- Thank you so much.

26:42.469 --> 26:45.805
- All right, Adam.

26:45.904 --> 26:48.307
How are you feeling, man?

26:45.904 --> 26:48.307
- Man, that was a--

26:48.407 --> 26:50.477
that was a show.

26:50.576 --> 26:51.845
Thank you guys for

26:50.576 --> 26:51.845
the theatrics.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.913
We were very entertained

26:51.944 --> 26:53.913
out here. That was great.

26:54.799 --> 26:57.549
So, um, you both got a chance

26:54.799 --> 26:57.549
to work with the vocal expert

26:57.650 --> 27:01.621
and the movement expert,

26:57.650 --> 27:01.621
and you totally brought it.

27:01.721 --> 27:04.691
Um, Adam over here, Keith,

27:04.790 --> 27:06.259
you looked like you were

27:04.790 --> 27:06.259
having more fun,

27:06.589 --> 27:08.279
which was great!

27:06.589 --> 27:08.279
I thought that was awesome.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.328
And you sound great.

27:09.429 --> 27:11.730
I can tell you mean it.

27:09.429 --> 27:11.730
You feel it.

27:11.830 --> 27:15.349
And Adam over here,

27:11.830 --> 27:15.349
Tim McGraw,

27:15.134 --> 27:17.403
you were having fun before,

27:15.134 --> 27:17.403
and I felt like the vocal

27:17.503 --> 27:19.138
was, like, up a notch.

27:17.503 --> 27:19.138
It was great.

27:19.239 --> 27:19.873
- Thank you.

27:19.239 --> 27:19.873
- Especially on the ballad,

27:20.673 --> 27:21.875
I felt like it was

27:20.673 --> 27:21.875
more refined,

27:22.420 --> 27:24.440
less of a caricature.

27:22.420 --> 27:24.440
I thought that was really great.

27:24.144 --> 27:25.244
Congratulations.

27:25.345 --> 27:28.714
[cheers and applause]

27:25.345 --> 27:28.714
- Oh, yeah, Mr. Tim.

27:28.815 --> 27:31.384
My goodness, called me out

27:28.815 --> 27:31.384
right in the beginning.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.618
- Yes.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.618
- I was like,

27:32.719 --> 27:34.487
"Oh, you said my name!"

27:32.719 --> 27:34.487
Like, I was lost.

27:34.586 --> 27:36.155
You were so great.

27:36.256 --> 27:37.656
I heard every word

27:36.256 --> 27:37.656
that you said.

27:37.757 --> 27:38.424
- Good.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.226
- And I saw the improvement.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.226
Good job.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.894
[applause]

27:42.619 --> 27:44.931
- Well, judges, you definitely

27:42.619 --> 27:44.931
got a lot to consider.

27:45.650 --> 27:46.332
- Yeah.

27:45.650 --> 27:46.332
- I'm glad I don't have

27:45.650 --> 27:46.332
to make a decision.

27:59.144 --> 28:03.182
**

28:04.250 --> 28:05.617
- Welcome back to

28:04.250 --> 28:05.617
"Clash of the Cover Bands."

28:05.719 --> 28:09.455
Now, we saw an amazing clash

28:05.719 --> 28:09.455
between two country tributes.

28:09.556 --> 28:11.790
Adam Rutledge

28:09.556 --> 28:11.790
as Keith Urban

28:11.891 --> 28:14.361
versus Adam Tucker

28:11.891 --> 28:14.361
as Tim McGraw.

28:14.461 --> 28:16.429
[cheering]

28:14.461 --> 28:16.429
Woo, I know!

28:16.528 --> 28:18.464
That was fire.

28:18.565 --> 28:20.299
This isn't gonna

28:18.565 --> 28:20.299
be easy,

28:20.400 --> 28:22.634
but it's time to give

28:20.400 --> 28:22.634
your verdict.

28:22.736 --> 28:25.904
Which one of

28:22.736 --> 28:25.904
these country kings

28:26.390 --> 28:27.173
reigned tonight?

28:27.272 --> 28:30.442
- Well, we saw both of you

28:27.272 --> 28:30.442
really progress a lot

28:30.542 --> 28:31.310
since the last performance.

28:31.411 --> 28:33.145
We saw you,

28:31.411 --> 28:33.145
Keith Urban Adam,

28:33.246 --> 28:35.714
with the smiles

28:33.246 --> 28:35.714
and the stage presence.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.584
He was all over the place,

28:35.815 --> 28:37.584
having a great time.

28:37.717 --> 28:42.221
**

28:42.322 --> 28:44.656
I feel like you're so close,

28:42.322 --> 28:44.656
but I hear nerves.

28:44.758 --> 28:46.589
- Are you typically

28:44.758 --> 28:46.589
always nervous, or--

28:46.159 --> 28:47.930
- I'm typically not.

28:47.192 --> 28:48.260
You know, I'm from

28:47.192 --> 28:48.260
a small town,

28:48.361 --> 28:49.962
So this is a once

28:48.361 --> 28:49.962
in a lifetime experience.

28:50.630 --> 28:51.431
* lettin' go--

28:51.530 --> 28:52.432
- There you go.

28:53.599 --> 28:54.134
When you move your mouth,

28:53.599 --> 28:54.134
that makes all the difference.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.903
- Own it and have fun

28:54.867 --> 28:56.903
with it.

28:57.700 --> 28:59.772
- You-you looked like

28:57.700 --> 28:59.772
you were having more fun,

28:59.873 --> 29:02.799
which was great.

28:59.873 --> 29:02.799
I thought that was awesome.

29:02.750 --> 29:04.544
- I want to show my family

29:02.750 --> 29:04.544
that you can do it.

29:04.644 --> 29:05.711
You just got to keep

29:04.644 --> 29:05.711
going for it

29:05.811 --> 29:07.313
and believe in yourself.

29:08.882 --> 29:11.351
- And Tim McGraw Adam,

29:11.451 --> 29:12.384
you worked on

29:11.451 --> 29:12.384
that twang.

29:12.484 --> 29:14.421
I heard every single word.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.655
Your stage presence was,

29:14.520 --> 29:16.655
like, above and beyond.

29:16.789 --> 29:20.626
**

29:20.727 --> 29:22.461
[laughing]

29:22.561 --> 29:24.497
There's almost a little

29:22.561 --> 29:24.497
too much twang,

29:24.596 --> 29:26.665
where I can't really understand

29:24.596 --> 29:26.665
what you're saying.

29:26.766 --> 29:28.667
- I think just getting you

29:26.766 --> 29:28.667
to just relax.

29:28.768 --> 29:30.135
- Yeah.

29:28.768 --> 29:30.135
- And just sing

29:30.236 --> 29:31.337
how you do

29:30.236 --> 29:31.337
your speaking voice.

29:31.438 --> 29:32.538
Like, put the twang there.

29:31.438 --> 29:32.538
- Yeah.

29:32.638 --> 29:33.873
- Pick your places.

29:32.638 --> 29:33.873
- Okay.

29:34.400 --> 29:35.709
- Hey, hey!

29:34.400 --> 29:35.709
- Oh.

29:35.808 --> 29:36.476
One more time.

29:36.576 --> 29:37.777
[indistinct]

29:37.876 --> 29:39.479
I been doing this

29:37.876 --> 29:39.479
for 18 years,

29:39.578 --> 29:41.280
but I'm learning a lot

29:39.578 --> 29:41.280
about myself,

29:41.381 --> 29:43.829
to be honest.

29:44.183 --> 29:45.285
- I understood every word

29:44.183 --> 29:45.285
you said.

29:45.384 --> 29:46.419
That made me so excited.

29:46.519 --> 29:48.855
You're a whole new voice

29:46.519 --> 29:48.855
and I love it.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.623
- It's just amazing

29:48.954 --> 29:50.623
to be here.

29:50.723 --> 29:53.589
To win this

29:50.723 --> 29:53.589
would be incredible.

29:53.159 --> 29:55.528
Yeah!

29:55.627 --> 29:56.762
- Adam and Adam,

29:56.863 --> 29:59.531
you both clearly worked

29:56.863 --> 29:59.531
really hard for this.

29:59.632 --> 30:00.633
You worked with

29:59.632 --> 30:00.633
the experts,

30:00.733 --> 30:03.690
and it showed tonight

30:00.733 --> 30:03.690
for sure.

30:03.169 --> 30:06.538
It's really hard,

30:03.169 --> 30:06.538
but we've made our decision.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.308
The ultimate cover band is...

30:13.645 --> 30:15.347
Tim McGraw.

30:15.448 --> 30:17.616
- Oh!

30:17.717 --> 30:19.251
Yeah!

30:19.352 --> 30:23.923
Make some noise for

30:19.352 --> 30:23.923
Adam Tucker as Tim McGraw!

30:24.240 --> 30:25.625
Congratulations.

30:25.724 --> 30:30.195
You are tonight's winner

30:25.724 --> 30:30.195
of "Clash of the Cover Bands!"

30:30.296 --> 30:31.931
Let's go.

30:32.319 --> 30:35.268
Now, not only are you walking

30:32.319 --> 30:35.268
away $10,000 richer,

30:35.367 --> 30:37.871
but you're also still

30:35.367 --> 30:37.871
in the running

30:37.971 --> 30:40.272
to be crowned our

30:37.971 --> 30:40.272
ultimate cover band

30:40.373 --> 30:42.342
and appear live on

30:40.373 --> 30:42.342
"The Tonight Show"

30:42.442 --> 30:43.843
starring Jimmy Fallon.

30:43.942 --> 30:45.778
Now, how are you feeling

30:43.942 --> 30:45.778
right now, man?

30:45.878 --> 30:48.114
How are you feeling?

30:45.878 --> 30:48.114
- Man, listen.

30:48.213 --> 30:51.851
I'm feeling great,

30:48.213 --> 30:51.851
and we did this.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.552
We are the king

30:51.951 --> 30:53.552
of country.

30:53.653 --> 30:55.121
- Excellent [indistinct]

30:53.653 --> 30:55.121
right there.

30:55.221 --> 30:58.124
Give it up one more time

30:55.221 --> 30:58.124
for both of these artists

30:58.223 --> 30:59.925
putting on a fantastic show.

31:00.599 --> 31:02.295
I know Keith and Tim,

31:02.394 --> 31:04.130
they would be rockin'

31:02.394 --> 31:04.130
with y'all right now.

31:04.230 --> 31:07.166
Thank you, Adam, Ester,

31:04.230 --> 31:07.166
and Meghan,

31:07.267 --> 31:08.768
and y'all, we will see you

31:07.267 --> 31:08.768
next time on

31:08.867 --> 31:10.970
"Clash of the Cover Bands."

31:11.710 --> 31:14.740
[cheers and applause]

31:15.141 --> 31:15.842
**

31:15.942 --> 31:17.309
Next week on "Clash..."

31:17.410 --> 31:19.479
It's all about pop divas.

31:19.578 --> 31:20.880
Britney Spears.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.615
* Not that innocent

31:22.715 --> 31:24.839
I feel like I'm watching

31:22.715 --> 31:24.839
"TRL" right now, Meghan.

31:24.150 --> 31:25.585
How you feelin'?

31:25.684 --> 31:28.121
Versus Jennifer Lopez.

31:28.221 --> 31:29.955
* Let's get loud

31:30.900 --> 31:32.920
It's hard to

31:30.900 --> 31:32.920
sing and dance.

31:32.192 --> 31:33.359
- You have to find

31:32.192 --> 31:33.359
a happy medium.

31:33.460 --> 31:34.594
* Get loud

31:34.693 --> 31:37.329
Every note, on purpose,

31:34.693 --> 31:37.329
every single time.

31:38.998 --> 31:40.633
- This is gonna be one

31:38.998 --> 31:40.633
of the hardest decisions

31:40.733 --> 31:42.634
we've ever had to make.
