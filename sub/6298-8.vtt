WEBVTT

00:08.492 --> 00:09.997
Previously on The Borgias...

00:10.009 --> 00:11.677
I would eliminate
the Sforza dynasty.

00:11.744 --> 00:13.445
Ludovico first.

00:13.479 --> 00:16.315
<i>He's in hiding</i>
<i>with Catherina's son, Benito.</i>

00:16.349 --> 00:18.750
I said "capture!"
Not "kill"!

00:19.819 --> 00:21.820
<i>What purchase can</i>
<i>we get with a dead Sforza?</i>

00:21.854 --> 00:23.221
Two dead Sforzas.

00:23.289 --> 00:26.458
Are you to be the one who
decides Rome's future?

00:26.492 --> 00:28.260
You followed me to Rome?

00:28.328 --> 00:29.895
Where does this
affection go?

00:29.963 --> 00:31.530
Affection leads
to weakness.

00:31.564 --> 00:33.165
<i>Sooner or later</i>
<i>he will tell you everything.</i>

00:33.232 --> 00:34.733
Remember the book.

00:34.801 --> 00:36.601
<i>Catallus's Carmina.</i>

00:36.669 --> 00:38.804
I have two cousins who
would fight to the death

00:38.838 --> 00:40.272
<i>for the throne of Naples,</i>

00:40.340 --> 00:42.341
<i>Prince Frederigo</i>
<i>and Prince Raphael.</i>

00:42.408 --> 00:44.843
<i>And I have no interest</i>

00:44.911 --> 00:46.445
in that kind of power!

00:46.546 --> 00:48.413
The Turk threatens our shipping.

00:48.514 --> 00:50.749
We will raise a mighty Crusade!

00:50.817 --> 00:54.953
The Crusade requires coin.
That is what he wants.

00:55.021 --> 00:56.989
The Spear of Longinus.

00:57.023 --> 00:58.890
<i>Pilgrims will</i>
<i>contribute generously</i>

00:58.925 --> 01:00.492
<i>to St. Peter's Pence.</i>

01:00.526 --> 01:03.362
We are putting on a show here.

01:04.897 --> 01:07.232
I accuse you of the poisoning
of the only barrier

01:07.266 --> 01:09.401
that lies between you
and the throne of Naples!

01:09.435 --> 01:11.403
<i>Hand the field over</i>
<i>to your brother!</i>

01:11.504 --> 01:12.971
So, we're safe now?

01:13.039 --> 01:16.041
As long as this king
lives, yes, we're safe.

01:16.075 --> 01:18.810
<i>I am Catherina</i>
<i>Sforza's eyes and ears,</i>

01:18.878 --> 01:21.613
<i>and I would beg you</i>
<i>to make no hasty moves</i>

01:21.714 --> 01:23.715
<i>until my exit is secured.</i>

01:23.750 --> 01:25.584

Bless me, Father,

07:35.154 --> 07:36.421
Lying is

07:36.455 --> 07:37.856
One Hail Mary and 20 carlina <i>-</i>

07:37.957 --> 07:39.257
Father, I have sinned.

07:39.291 --> 07:40.658
And blasphemy,
you know, is serious.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.727
Eleven ducats.

07:42.795 --> 07:45.663
<i>Forgive me my sins.</i>
<i>I have fornicated.</i>

and donate 16 ducats to
our Holy Mother Church.

07:51.871 --> 07:53.171
<i>Forgive me, Father.</i>

07:53.205 --> 07:54.672
<i>I've been having</i>
<i>unpure thoughts...</i>

07:54.707 --> 07:56.808
Be pure of thought and deed

07:56.842 --> 08:00.378
and donate 12 ducats to
our Holy Mother Church -

08:01.847 --> 08:03.214
Twenty-five.

08:04.683 --> 08:06.651
Twenty-five?

08:06.685 --> 08:09.687
Twenty-five.
I'm a carpenter, not a banker.

08:09.722 --> 08:12.056
Can I not say
my penance in prayer?

08:12.158 --> 08:14.058
It's 25.

08:44.056 --> 08:46.224
Benito, my son.

08:49.528 --> 08:53.364
Can we both taste
revenge now, Cardinal?

08:53.399 --> 08:55.667
I am but
a common prelate.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.972
And revenge
would be sweet.

09:02.041 --> 09:06.478
The Holy Year.

09:06.512 --> 09:10.181
The pilgrims
flock to Rome,

09:10.249 --> 09:12.684
filling the papal
coffers for what-

09:12.751 --> 09:14.686
I have no doubt about it-

09:14.720 --> 09:17.489
will be an assault on me.

09:17.556 --> 09:19.924
But the pilgrim way
passes through Marino.

09:22.061 --> 09:24.229
Through Sforza
territory.

09:27.032 --> 09:29.033
There are catacombs
in Marino.

09:29.068 --> 09:34.873
If we could display
a relic there...

09:34.940 --> 09:37.942
of such magnificence,

09:38.010 --> 09:42.480
of such sanctity,
that it would divert

09:42.548 --> 09:45.550
all of those pilgrims from
their journey to St. Peter's...

09:50.856 --> 09:53.057
...what would it be?

09:56.061 --> 09:58.863
What have we here,
Cardinal De Luca?

09:58.898 --> 10:00.965
The Shroud
of Constantinople.

10:01.066 --> 10:02.700
It looks convincing.

10:02.735 --> 10:04.202
Thank you.

10:04.236 --> 10:06.604
<i>It definitely cost enough.</i>

10:06.705 --> 10:08.706
It wrapped our blessed
Saviour's body.

10:08.741 --> 10:11.543
It bears the imprint
of His sacred face.

10:11.577 --> 10:13.878
Will it fill the faithful
with awe, Cardinal?

10:13.913 --> 10:15.179
<i>It should.</i>

10:15.247 --> 10:17.949
It's the most sacred relic
known to Christendom.

10:17.983 --> 10:21.152
So, we charge the
pilgrims a hefty fee

10:21.253 --> 10:23.254
for onward passage
to Rome -

10:23.289 --> 10:25.957
or they can view our shroud
for no fee at all.

10:28.761 --> 10:30.762
But is the Shroud
wonder enough?

10:34.300 --> 10:35.934
Perhaps we should
add a miracle...

10:37.636 --> 10:39.637
Tears.
Tears?

10:39.672 --> 10:44.042
Tears of blood -
on Our Saviour's face-

10:44.109 --> 10:47.779
should draw the faithful
like flies to honey.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.615
Better than any
Spear of Longinus.

10:50.649 --> 10:52.317
Do it.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.469
Adultery, no doubt.

11:11.503 --> 11:12.804
Holiness.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.006
Diamond and black pearl.
Mm-hm.

11:15.074 --> 11:16.374
Mm.
Indeed.

11:17.476 --> 11:19.344
A word, young man.

11:19.478 --> 11:21.312
Holiness?

11:25.651 --> 11:29.053
All these donations

11:29.154 --> 11:33.157
to the Confessional Fund
go to...?

11:33.192 --> 11:34.859
The Vatican Treasury,
Your Holiness.

11:34.893 --> 11:37.895
No. No.

11:37.997 --> 11:41.032
To a side account in
the Vatican Treasury.

11:41.066 --> 11:42.700
Called?

11:42.768 --> 11:46.604
The Constantinople Endeavour.

11:46.705 --> 11:49.307
The Constantinople
Endeavour.

11:49.375 --> 11:54.479
Our Crusade against
the Infidel, the Turk.

11:54.546 --> 11:59.217
And the account books for this
fund are for your eyes only.

12:01.587 --> 12:03.221
The entire Turkish navy

12:03.255 --> 12:07.925
could be burnt to
a cinder, with oil.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.661
Oil?

12:09.728 --> 12:14.999
Lamp oil, pitch,
tallow, olive oil.

12:15.067 --> 12:18.403
If we spend the coin,
place the order now,

12:18.437 --> 12:20.471
for shipment to
the Christian lands,

12:20.572 --> 12:22.440
come the month of Ramadan,

12:22.474 --> 12:25.576
our oil-laden ships could
be berthed in Kefalonia

12:25.644 --> 12:29.480
for the Holy month, alongside
the entire Turkish fleet.

12:30.783 --> 12:32.450
How does it burn?

12:32.551 --> 12:34.952
There are Jews in Kefalonia.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.487
Ah-ha.

12:39.658 --> 12:42.226
And can you ensure
its success?

12:42.261 --> 12:45.596
If -
and only if -

12:45.631 --> 12:47.532
your Holiness
withdraws his demands -

12:47.599 --> 12:48.933
Oh...
to tax my people.

12:49.001 --> 12:51.903
If we can live freely -
trade freely -

12:51.970 --> 12:54.038
in this city of Rome.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.641
You ask for much,
Murrano.

12:56.675 --> 12:59.677
I am no Murrano.
No?

12:59.778 --> 13:02.480
You, on the other hand...

13:02.614 --> 13:03.848
Careful.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.350
I have heard the rumours.

13:06.418 --> 13:09.253
That Jewish blood
runs in Borgia veins.

13:12.424 --> 13:14.625
Why do you think
they hate you so?

13:19.298 --> 13:22.200
We could have your hide
for this presumption.

13:22.301 --> 13:25.636
But you are wiser
than that.

13:25.671 --> 13:28.339
So follow my guidance,
and your Crusade is won.

13:29.708 --> 13:32.276
The Adriatic is free of
the Moor and the Turk.

13:32.344 --> 13:34.679
As is the Mediterranean.

13:34.713 --> 13:38.382
All that is needed is
the coin to buy the oil.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.284
Well...

13:42.121 --> 13:46.858
if you can ensure the
success of this scheme,

13:46.892 --> 13:49.861
you will have
your papal bull.

13:55.200 --> 13:58.703
Come.
Come inside.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.073
Please, take one.
Welcome.

14:03.909 --> 14:06.344
It's a miracle;
you will see.

14:38.911 --> 14:40.211
A miracle!

14:40.279 --> 14:41.579
<i>Yes!</i>

14:41.647 --> 14:44.382
<i>Yes! Yes!</i>

14:44.416 --> 14:46.284
A miracle!

14:46.385 --> 14:48.386
Oh Lord,

14:48.420 --> 14:51.022
I have lived to see
the glory of your tears.

14:53.592 --> 14:55.092
Nomine Patri <i>-</i>

14:58.697 --> 15:00.565
Behold!

15:00.599 --> 15:02.867
The tears
of our saviour!

15:06.371 --> 15:08.639
A miracle!

15:27.459 --> 15:29.393
You've heard?
Mm.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.563
She's blocked
the pilgrim way.

15:32.598 --> 15:36.300
She claims that some random
rag hanging in Marino

15:36.335 --> 15:38.236
is the Shroud of our
Blessed Lord Himself.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.641
And our son
finds it amusing?

15:43.675 --> 15:46.611
I merely wonder
where this will end.

15:46.645 --> 15:48.946
What next in this
competition of relics?

15:48.981 --> 15:50.781
The Ark of the Covenant?

15:50.849 --> 15:52.850
The tablets of Moses?

15:52.951 --> 15:54.619
The Ark of Noah, perhaps.

15:54.653 --> 15:56.787
If you could find the
manpower to build it.

15:56.855 --> 15:58.890
Yes.

15:58.957 --> 16:02.093
Well, my son,
whatever our failings,

16:02.127 --> 16:04.962
we do not trade
in fakery.

16:05.030 --> 16:06.597
No?

16:06.632 --> 16:09.133
The Spear of Longinus?

16:09.167 --> 16:11.402
Is genuine.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.371
We have it on
the best authority.

16:13.438 --> 16:15.139
Of course,
that wandering Jew.

16:16.508 --> 16:18.075
He has been more
help to our cause

16:18.143 --> 16:19.844
than the entire
consistory.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.614
Now, you will
ride North.

16:25.317 --> 16:29.553
<i>You will expel the bitch</i>
<i>of Forli from Marino</i>

16:29.655 --> 16:33.925
and bring the Shroud back here

16:33.992 --> 16:37.361
so that we can vouch
its authenticity ourselves.

16:37.462 --> 16:39.397
With what army?

16:39.498 --> 16:41.232
Your own army.

16:41.300 --> 16:45.002
Surely papal arms should
be used for such a task.

16:45.037 --> 16:47.672
I would not waste
my own blood and treasure

16:47.739 --> 16:49.407
to free up pilgrim coin.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.509
Ah.

16:51.576 --> 16:53.878
One last time, Father.

16:53.979 --> 16:55.680
What?

16:55.747 --> 16:57.848
Give me command.

16:59.885 --> 17:02.219
We will pay you.

17:02.287 --> 17:05.723
By the day, by the horse,
by the ma

17:09.394 --> 17:11.996
Your mercenary,
Holy Father.

17:25.877 --> 17:30.514
Cesare Borgia is headed
toward the shrine in Marino

17:30.582 --> 17:33.684
to open up the pilgrim way.

17:46.865 --> 17:47.999
Keep that torch back.

17:48.066 --> 17:49.867
Not too close!

17:58.076 --> 18:00.945
We have word, my lady,
that the Borgia is coming.

18:03.915 --> 18:06.951
If there are
pilgrims here,

18:07.052 --> 18:09.387
there will be deaths.

18:09.454 --> 18:10.855
Many deaths.

18:10.889 --> 18:13.190
Well, they will die with
God in their hearts -

18:13.258 --> 18:15.526
as my son did.

18:27.906 --> 18:30.041
Out!
All of them! Out!

18:30.075 --> 18:31.776
Move along!

18:31.910 --> 18:33.744
Clear the square.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.179
Get them away!

18:35.247 --> 18:36.747
Send them to Rome!

18:36.782 --> 18:37.915
<i>It's a miracle!</i>
<i>Tears of blood.</i>

18:37.983 --> 18:39.517
What's he saying?

18:39.584 --> 18:43.187
Something about a miracle.
Tears of blood.

18:43.255 --> 18:47.191
The Shroud of Constantinople.

18:47.259 --> 18:49.627
<i>Go away! Move!</i>

19:31.603 --> 19:33.804
Tears of blood, my friend.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.339
I shed them often,
my lord.

20:20.018 --> 20:21.152
Paint.

20:22.654 --> 20:24.355
Red pigment.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.729
Run!

20:52.350 --> 20:55.019
The wrath of God,
my friend.

21:52.043 --> 21:53.444
Jesus must love you -

21:53.545 --> 21:56.013
Cesare Borgia.

21:57.282 --> 21:59.550
Yes.

21:59.618 --> 22:02.253
Yes, he wept.

22:02.354 --> 22:04.622
He wept bloodied tears.

22:08.793 --> 22:10.561
He does.

22:14.199 --> 22:15.733
He does.

22:18.403 --> 22:20.237
He loves me.

22:23.408 --> 22:25.809
Jesus loves me!

22:33.251 --> 22:35.252
Tears of blood?

22:35.353 --> 22:39.189
And then the earth exploded.

22:39.224 --> 22:41.492
Thank the Lord
you were spared.

22:41.559 --> 22:43.961
Thank God indeed.

22:45.297 --> 22:47.431
And a false shroud.

22:47.565 --> 22:48.632
Huh?

22:48.700 --> 22:51.435
One has to admire
her invention -

22:51.569 --> 22:53.270
if it is hers.

22:53.338 --> 22:56.840
You think there's
another hand involved?

22:56.941 --> 22:58.575
She has a dark shadow.

22:58.610 --> 23:00.344
It has crossed us
twice now.

23:00.412 --> 23:02.546
And what is the name
of this dark shadow?

23:05.617 --> 23:07.418
Rufio.

23:08.953 --> 23:11.055
Rufio.

23:13.024 --> 23:16.293
We need all the
friends we can get -

23:16.394 --> 23:21.532
which is why
we are investing

23:21.566 --> 23:24.468
King Frederigo of Naples.

23:50.395 --> 23:51.495
Your cousin, I believe.

23:51.596 --> 23:54.131
Once removed, yes.

23:54.165 --> 23:55.966
And can you trust him
with your family's future?

23:56.067 --> 23:59.470
I have no option, my lord.

23:59.504 --> 24:02.072
Which means you don't.
No.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.507
Which means your sister

24:03.575 --> 24:05.976
was the arbiter
of these events, not I.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.713
What is that?

25:16.815 --> 25:18.715
Your name.

25:21.319 --> 25:23.720
You can't read,
can you?

25:25.990 --> 25:27.825
I have no learning.

25:27.892 --> 25:31.862
I worked with my father
while others were at school.

25:31.963 --> 25:33.797
Then how can
you write?

25:33.832 --> 25:36.233
I remember shapes,

25:36.334 --> 25:38.035
all shapes.

25:38.069 --> 25:41.839
Like pictures in my head,
I do not forget.

25:41.906 --> 25:44.074
I can copy.

25:44.175 --> 25:45.642
I saw these shapes

25:45.677 --> 25:47.177
on the floor
over there.

25:47.312 --> 25:48.912
Why?

25:48.980 --> 25:51.348
I like to write your name
when you are absent.

25:51.483 --> 25:53.550
Why?

25:53.585 --> 25:55.419
It's the language
of love.

25:57.922 --> 26:01.024
So if I cannot read,
I cannot love?

26:01.092 --> 26:03.193
And how
do I learn?

26:03.228 --> 26:05.262
I can read
to you.

26:05.363 --> 26:07.498
Then read.

26:08.766 --> 26:10.934
Odi et amo.

26:11.002 --> 26:15.239
Quare id faciam,
fortasse requiris?

26:15.340 --> 26:22.212
Nescio, sed fiere
sentio et excrucior <i>.</i>

26:24.349 --> 26:26.216
What does it mean?

26:26.284 --> 26:29.386
I hate and I love.

26:29.420 --> 26:32.055
Why, you may ask?

26:32.123 --> 26:34.291
I don't know.

26:34.359 --> 26:36.593
But it happens
and I burn.

26:43.968 --> 26:47.404
I know this feeling,
all my life.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.542
All my life.

27:09.594 --> 27:12.296
I have one last favour
I would ask, Your Holiness.

27:13.565 --> 27:15.666
Tell us.

27:15.733 --> 27:18.402
French arms are upon
Italian soil once more.

27:19.971 --> 27:22.306
And they will
stay in Milan.

27:22.407 --> 27:23.840
One hopes.

27:23.908 --> 27:27.177
But, to guard against any
misunderstanding between us,

27:27.245 --> 27:29.179
I would ask for the appointment
of a special ambassador

27:29.247 --> 27:31.315
between the Holy See
and Naples.

27:31.382 --> 27:33.417
But we already
have one.

27:33.451 --> 27:37.020
One of little
consequence.

27:37.088 --> 27:41.358
But, to keep our ties
of friendship intact,

27:41.426 --> 27:44.494
I would plead for one
of mighty consequence.

27:44.562 --> 27:46.763
With all the wisdom
and stagecraft

27:46.831 --> 27:49.166
necessary
to the task.

27:49.267 --> 27:52.803
Your daughter,
Lucrezia Borgia.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.941
That is indeed an honour.

27:57.976 --> 28:00.644
Lucrezia?

28:00.678 --> 28:03.981
I am...
surprised...

28:04.082 --> 28:06.083
...and honoured.

28:06.117 --> 28:08.118
So, she will

28:08.186 --> 28:09.953
reside in Naples?

28:10.021 --> 28:12.522
She already does.

28:12.590 --> 28:15.792
With her husband
and her child?

28:15.827 --> 28:17.861
Of course.

28:17.929 --> 28:20.464
I would have her travel
back with my retinue

28:20.598 --> 28:22.432
as my most honoured guest.

30:09.841 --> 30:12.342
Peace, brother.

30:14.545 --> 30:16.346
Peace.

30:24.455 --> 30:25.889
Ambassador.

30:28.126 --> 30:30.727
And my embassy awaits.

30:33.531 --> 30:35.398
Do you trust him?

30:39.570 --> 30:42.773
Yes.

30:42.874 --> 30:45.142
And what does it
matter now?

30:45.243 --> 30:48.912
I have my child.

30:48.980 --> 30:52.249
I have my husband.

30:52.316 --> 30:53.917
I have everything
I wanted.

30:57.989 --> 30:59.723
Everything?

31:04.295 --> 31:06.797
Almost everything.

31:11.736 --> 31:13.603
Come and visit soon.

31:58.816 --> 32:00.617
We need bread.

32:00.651 --> 32:03.653
Yes. And milk,
and honey and cheese.

32:07.692 --> 32:09.459
Go to the market.

33:07.018 --> 33:09.019
When did you
learn to write?

33:09.053 --> 33:12.188
I do not read
and I do not write.

33:12.223 --> 33:15.859
But I remember,
and I copy.

33:15.927 --> 33:17.394
And I must

33:17.428 --> 33:19.262
before this fades
and is lost.

33:21.499 --> 33:23.533
What is this?

33:23.567 --> 33:25.535
I see pictures
in my mind's eye -

33:25.569 --> 33:27.704
shapes.

33:27.772 --> 33:31.374
On the page.

33:31.409 --> 33:32.909
Like a map that
would lead us to war.

33:33.010 --> 33:35.679
But I -

33:35.713 --> 33:37.781
I do not know
what it means.

33:37.882 --> 33:39.549
We need a mirror.

33:59.670 --> 34:02.238
Oh. Look.

34:02.273 --> 34:05.742
This is mirror writing.

34:05.810 --> 34:08.078
You can read this?

34:08.145 --> 34:10.447
These are all numbers.

34:10.481 --> 34:13.583
Each one of them has to
mean something different.

34:13.617 --> 34:15.819
There must be a code.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.654
Book code, I think.

34:22.760 --> 34:24.360
And where did you
find this?

34:24.428 --> 34:26.663
You do not need to know.
I'm afraid I must!

34:26.764 --> 34:28.665
The letter, my lord!

34:28.766 --> 34:31.668
What does it say?

34:31.768 --> 34:35.804
Nothing, as yet.

34:35.906 --> 34:38.408
So who did you copy this from?

34:38.476 --> 34:41.678
Someone I know.

34:41.779 --> 34:43.112
A friend?

34:45.449 --> 34:49.319
Well, you make sure
he remains your friend.

34:49.353 --> 34:50.754
He'll have a book.
Find it.

34:50.788 --> 34:52.589
The book is
the key to this.

35:37.935 --> 35:39.269
How would you define

35:39.303 --> 35:41.805
my ambassadorial duties,
Your Highness?

35:41.872 --> 35:44.474
Quite simple, really.

35:44.508 --> 35:47.811
You must keep me informed
of your brother's designs.

35:47.878 --> 35:49.612
And your father's.

35:50.881 --> 35:52.949
Your home is Naples.

35:52.983 --> 35:55.251
Your heart must
be in Naples.

35:55.319 --> 35:59.022
Your allegiance
solely to Naples.

36:16.841 --> 36:19.676
Your tone has changed,
my liege.

36:19.710 --> 36:21.744
Of course.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.848
I am king.

36:24.982 --> 36:26.683
What else
did you expect?

36:34.859 --> 36:36.226
Ladies first.

36:36.327 --> 36:37.527
Hm...

37:17.101 --> 37:18.701
Read to me.

37:27.311 --> 37:28.778
Let us live,

37:28.879 --> 37:31.781
my Lesbia,

37:31.882 --> 37:35.285
and love,

37:35.319 --> 37:38.188
and value
at one farthing

37:38.255 --> 37:41.257
the talk of
crabbed old men.

37:48.399 --> 37:51.167
Crabbed old men.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.788
You have the letter?

38:15.893 --> 38:17.260
Sit.

38:24.635 --> 38:27.303
Each number

38:27.404 --> 38:31.608
refers to a verse,
then a line, then a word.

38:36.280 --> 38:38.448
A nine.
That's verse nine.

38:45.522 --> 38:48.558
Then "Novem."

38:48.626 --> 38:50.960
Another nine.
That's line nine.

38:51.028 --> 38:52.362
Seven.

38:52.429 --> 38:56.799
Seventh word,
line nine, verse nine.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.968
That's...

38:59.036 --> 39:00.336
"They."

39:01.705 --> 39:03.606
A beginning.

39:06.677 --> 39:10.880
Who are "they"?

39:15.686 --> 39:17.654
I wonder?

39:19.523 --> 39:22.325
Twenty-seven,
that's verse 27.

39:25.796 --> 39:28.164
Line six, word three.

39:30.567 --> 39:32.368
"Must."

39:32.469 --> 39:34.237
"They must ..."

39:42.079 --> 39:44.080
Forli.

39:45.749 --> 39:47.917
The message:

39:48.018 --> 39:49.686
"They must not suspect.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.487
"He will lock the cage.

39:51.522 --> 39:54.090
We must know when they
will move on Forli."

39:56.360 --> 39:58.494
A cage is
for an animal

39:58.562 --> 40:00.196
or a prisoner.

40:01.699 --> 40:04.300
So who is in the cage
and who is the prisoner?

40:04.368 --> 40:06.669
Forli.
Catherina Sforza.

40:07.771 --> 40:11.708
But who is this "he"?

40:11.742 --> 40:14.844
I could beat it
out of him.

40:17.247 --> 40:18.681
Beat it out of whom?

40:21.218 --> 40:23.019
The boy who had the letter.

40:25.389 --> 40:28.391
A boy?

40:28.459 --> 40:30.126
What boy?

40:32.029 --> 40:33.763
A boy I took to my bed.

40:37.034 --> 40:40.169
The spy you took
to your bed.

40:50.114 --> 40:53.082
Kill me now,
my lord, please.

40:53.150 --> 40:55.318
Please?

40:55.419 --> 40:56.819
No.

40:56.920 --> 40:59.255
No, no killing.

40:59.289 --> 41:01.324
You must keep on
loving this boy.

41:06.063 --> 41:08.431
I can hate and love.

41:12.636 --> 41:15.605
These words are
worth more than gold.

41:15.672 --> 41:17.440
They will tell us
what she thinks.

41:17.508 --> 41:19.308
What she plans.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.134
All eyes.

41:56.013 --> 41:57.880
Are we in need
of protection?

41:57.981 --> 42:00.016
Not that I know of.

42:00.050 --> 42:01.851
Well, then why
do we have it?

42:01.952 --> 42:04.153
Is Naples always thus?

42:04.221 --> 42:05.721
Eyes watching
one's every move?

42:05.789 --> 42:07.457
Guards at
every corner?

42:07.491 --> 42:09.625
Will they even
watch us make love?

43:08.685 --> 43:10.753
"They suspect nothing.

43:10.821 --> 43:15.024
She thinks the King
of Naples is a friend."

43:15.092 --> 43:17.994
My God.

43:18.028 --> 43:20.530
And I knew.
Somewhere I knew.

43:20.597 --> 43:22.298
Knew what, my lord?

43:22.366 --> 43:24.867
He's in league
with Catherina Sforza.

43:24.935 --> 43:27.637
King Frederigo of Naples.

43:27.704 --> 43:29.372
She chose the wrong brother!

43:31.208 --> 43:34.443
My sister is
no ambassador.

43:34.511 --> 43:37.847
She and her child
will be kept hostage

43:37.881 --> 43:39.916
the moment
we attack Forli!

43:43.387 --> 43:45.988
Kill him.

43:46.023 --> 43:47.757
You kill the boy.

44:05.409 --> 44:07.643
My lady?
However irregular it may be -

44:07.711 --> 44:09.412
Please!
I will speak to His Highness.

44:10.948 --> 44:14.784
And ask him explain
my confinement.

44:14.851 --> 44:16.886
I apologize, Your Highness.

44:16.954 --> 44:18.788
Leave us.

44:23.627 --> 44:26.862
You are a prisoner,
my dear, plain and simple.

44:26.897 --> 44:28.731
And why am I
a prisoner?

44:30.567 --> 44:34.370
Because you chose
the wrong brother.

44:39.309 --> 44:41.844
Plenty of spice.

44:41.912 --> 44:44.280
<i>You will be missed Sebastian.</i>

44:44.381 --> 44:46.949
He did have secrets -

44:47.050 --> 44:48.751
poisonous ones.

44:48.819 --> 44:51.587
As a Borgia,

44:51.655 --> 44:54.256
you should
have known better.

44:56.493 --> 45:01.931
Poison is your hobby,
is it not?

45:06.069 --> 45:08.971
So you are in
a cage, my dear.

45:09.006 --> 45:12.108
Your every need
will be catered for.

45:12.142 --> 45:14.510
You will dine

45:14.578 --> 45:16.178
on gold and
silver platter.

45:19.349 --> 45:21.584
The best Neapolitan
cuisine.

45:24.588 --> 45:28.624
But you can never leave.

45:38.969 --> 45:40.936
Borgia bitch.

46:02.559 --> 46:04.860
Could she be
with child?

46:04.895 --> 46:09.331
I truly doubt
that possibility.

46:09.399 --> 46:11.133
And why, my love?

46:16.039 --> 46:19.041
There is a woman
in the forest.

46:19.076 --> 46:22.478
She knows every cure
that the earth provides.

46:22.512 --> 46:24.680
I would be examined by her.

46:37.594 --> 46:41.263
I hate and I love.

46:41.364 --> 46:44.366
Why, you may ask?

46:44.434 --> 46:46.702
I do not know -

46:46.770 --> 46:48.237
but it happens.

46:48.271 --> 46:53.876
And I...

46:53.944 --> 46:56.512
How does it go?
Hm?

46:56.546 --> 46:58.514
I burn.

46:58.582 --> 47:01.183
No, in the Latin,
please.

47:06.490 --> 47:08.324
Excrucior.
Excrucior!

47:10.827 --> 47:12.828
It is a big word
for "burn."

47:14.831 --> 47:16.432
Why?

47:16.500 --> 47:17.666
Why did you become
my lover?

47:17.701 --> 47:19.869
Why?
Because I was made an offer!

47:19.903 --> 47:21.504
From whom?

47:22.606 --> 47:24.440
You enjoyed the thrill -

47:24.508 --> 47:26.375
The danger - yes?

47:26.443 --> 47:30.713
Yes! Yes,
I admit, I did.

47:30.781 --> 47:32.715
I should flay
you alive!

47:34.718 --> 47:36.252
But I'll be merciful.

47:36.353 --> 47:37.386
You will?

48:05.816 --> 48:10.119
You tell me how you
wish to die, Pascal.

48:12.422 --> 48:14.657
I die?

48:32.108 --> 48:33.776
In your arms.

48:56.266 --> 48:57.633
You love another,

48:59.469 --> 49:01.503
who is not your husband.

49:04.207 --> 49:06.008
Close to you.

49:08.678 --> 49:10.212
Too close.

49:10.313 --> 49:11.981
Tell me more.

49:13.383 --> 49:15.517
You are
a prisoner here.

49:15.552 --> 49:17.820
And whose fault
is that?

49:17.888 --> 49:19.321
Mine.

49:19.456 --> 49:21.190
Forgive me.

49:21.224 --> 49:22.491
I knew he wanted
to be king

49:22.559 --> 49:24.126
but I did not know
that he would confine

49:24.194 --> 49:28.063
such a splendid
witch as you.

49:28.131 --> 49:32.067
But you have a future
away from here.

49:32.168 --> 49:36.805
So your hand tells me.

49:36.840 --> 49:38.707
How do I leave?

49:38.842 --> 49:41.510
You could make them sleep.

49:41.578 --> 49:44.647
Everybody sleeps,
do they not?

49:44.681 --> 49:47.716
Just never at the time
we want them to.

49:54.524 --> 49:57.593
I put a whole village
to sleep once with this.

50:11.908 --> 50:13.475
A bull is prepared

50:13.543 --> 50:15.010
and awaits your signature,
Holiness.

50:16.413 --> 50:17.746
All is ready?

50:17.781 --> 50:19.214
Ships loaded
with oil

50:19.249 --> 50:20.883
are docked
at Kefalonia.

50:20.951 --> 50:22.251
Uh-huh.

50:23.353 --> 50:26.188
And the Turkish fleet?
Docked alongside.

50:27.190 --> 50:28.624
Hm.

50:31.227 --> 50:33.128
And when will this happen?

50:33.229 --> 50:35.731
It may have
happened already.

50:52.582 --> 50:54.450
A Borgia bull.
