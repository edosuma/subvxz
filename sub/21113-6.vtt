00:02.136 --> 00:04.038
- All right, lovelies,
let's catch up

00:04.072 --> 00:04.805
with the women of "Bold."

00:04.838 --> 00:06.474
Jane, determined to be

00:06.507 --> 00:08.309
the world's finest
feminist writer,

00:08.342 --> 00:09.577
learns that means straddling
a fine line

00:09.610 --> 00:12.146
and revealing yourself.
- [screams]

00:12.180 --> 00:13.814
- Kat kissed a girl.
- And I liked it.

00:13.847 --> 00:17.451
- She really liked it,
but not everything else.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.187
- I booked a flight to Paris.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.555
Coco and I are going
to try to work things out.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.291
- And Sutton finally
got her job offer

00:23.324 --> 00:25.059
in the fashion department.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.627
- The starting salary,
it's just a little bit

00:26.660 --> 00:29.163
lower than I was expecting.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.465
- But she'd have to push
to make it work.

00:31.499 --> 00:34.268
- I'm Nora Ephron, bitch.

00:34.302 --> 00:36.170
- These are the women
of "The Bold Type."

00:37.471 --> 00:38.606
[upbeat music]

00:38.639 --> 00:40.274

00:40.308 --> 00:42.210

00:42.243 --> 00:44.078
* What happened
to my dreams... *

00:44.112 --> 00:45.613
- I'm not entirely
convinced this is a good idea.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.581
- I am.
- You're not just embracing

00:47.615 --> 00:50.351
the crazy to get over Adena?
- No.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.486
Are you wearing a bra?
What is that?

00:52.520 --> 00:54.522
- Okay, you know what?
- I can't feel.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.857
The fact that you guys can't
even tell is really depressing.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.592
Hey, no bra or no bra,
it doesn't make a difference

00:58.626 --> 01:00.861
'cause it's all
coming off in a minute, yeah?

01:00.894 --> 01:03.497
- Yeah.
- Not yeah.

01:05.433 --> 01:06.667
And there they are.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.569
- Are we gonna
get in trouble for this?

01:08.602 --> 01:10.671
- No, Jane.
It's all right. It's legal.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.873
- Yeah,
a lot of things are legal.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.609
Yoga pants on a date are legal.
Doesn't mean we should do it.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.145
- It was one time.
Yeah, you still did it.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.846
Hey, check out
cargo shorts dude.

01:18.879 --> 01:21.582
- He's totally gonna stare.
- Get a lawn chair, perv.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.318
But also, hey.
- All right, ladies.

01:24.352 --> 01:27.455
Are we almost ready?
[cheering]

01:27.488 --> 01:30.258
- No, not ready.
I'm not ready.

01:30.291 --> 01:33.861
- Jane, in 1986,
seven New York women

01:33.894 --> 01:35.863
on a picnic were charged
with showing

01:35.896 --> 01:38.566
"that portion of the breast
below the top of the areola."

01:38.599 --> 01:41.702
They appealed, and they won.
- Yeah.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.704
- Women fought
for our right to do this.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.673
- Anywhere in New York
that a man can take his top off,

01:45.706 --> 01:47.875
so can a woman.
It's the law.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.210
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- And I respect the law.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.479
- Yeah.
This is our contribution

01:51.512 --> 01:54.182
in an ongoing mission to fight
for women's breast health

01:54.215 --> 01:55.716
and breast equality.
- Oh, come on.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.451
You're just whipping
your boobs out.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.886
- Uh, yeah.
- True.

01:58.919 --> 02:01.555
- That is our
water delivery guy.

02:01.589 --> 02:04.192
You guys are gonna
flash the water delivery guy?

02:04.225 --> 02:05.426
- They're just breasts,
Jane.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.161
- Exactly,
which is why mine

02:07.195 --> 02:09.163
are going to stay
in my bra where they belong.

02:09.197 --> 02:11.665
all: Three, two, one.

02:11.699 --> 02:15.169
Go!
- You two guys have fun though.

02:15.203 --> 02:17.638

Stop, you guys. Seriously.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.724
This has been my desk
for the past three years.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.759

02:53.807 --> 02:55.676
- Red.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.546
From now on, early is on time,
and on time is late.

02:58.579 --> 03:01.549
- Got it.
- See this flea market?

03:01.582 --> 03:03.417
It all leaves
for Iceland in two days,

03:03.451 --> 03:05.353
which means every piece
gets ID'd,

03:05.386 --> 03:07.488

and carefully packed

03:07.521 --> 03:09.990
so that we don't have
any problems with customs.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.193
- Yes, I'm on it.

03:14.395 --> 03:18.366
- Mm-mm. This break room dreck
is not giving me life today.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.000
I'm getting coffee
for the room.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.570
Anyone?
- Venti cap.

03:22.603 --> 03:23.971
- Chai tea.
- Espresso.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.274
- Americano. Two Splendas.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.811
Don't run away to Aruba.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.581
- That's a venti cap, chai tea,

03:56.337 --> 04:00.808
- Have you ever wakeboarded?
- Uh, no.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.477
- They crank the music
from the back of the boat.

04:03.511 --> 04:06.314
- Okay.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.282
- So yesterday,
you posted a photo

04:08.316 --> 04:10.518
on Scarlet's Instagram account
that was removed

04:10.551 --> 04:12.386
by their compliance.
May I see it?

04:12.420 --> 04:15.789
- Uh, sure. It was the topless
protest in Central Park.

04:15.823 --> 04:19.026
I thought it fit well with our
breast health awareness issue.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.061
- Well, unfortunately,
Instagram has rules

04:21.094 --> 04:22.796
against posting photos
that include women's nipples.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.598
As our social media director,

04:24.632 --> 04:25.766
I'm surprised that
you didn't know that.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.768
- Oh, I did.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.637
That policy is sexist.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.373
Men can post photos of
their nipples but women can't,

04:32.406 --> 04:34.375
even though it's legal
for women to be topless.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.709
- You're making
the posting's removal

04:35.743 --> 04:37.345
from Instagram the story?

04:37.378 --> 04:38.779
- Already picked up
on "Jezebel."

04:38.812 --> 04:40.648
- That's an aggressive
strategy, which I like,

04:40.681 --> 04:42.816
but for the time
being I want you to stop.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.385
- What?

04:44.418 --> 04:45.786
- And so does our
board of directors.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.556
They've contacted me about this.
- Really?

04:48.589 --> 04:50.358
- I know
that it's frustrating, Kat,

04:50.391 --> 04:52.393
but our Instagram account
is important.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.061
It has enormous reach,

04:54.094 --> 04:55.696
and we can't afford
to have it taken down.

04:55.729 --> 04:58.666
So no more nipple postings
until you hear from me.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.468
- Yeah, okay.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.603
- Thank you.

All right, ladies.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.306
What do you have for me?

05:08.742 --> 05:11.345
What are the qualifications
to be a board member?

05:11.379 --> 05:13.781
- Balding,
off the rack suits, juggling.

05:13.814 --> 05:14.915
- No, I'm serious.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.384
- I don't know, why?

05:16.417 --> 05:17.618
- They just killed the campaign

05:17.651 --> 05:18.852
to raise
breast cancer awareness,

05:18.886 --> 05:22.556
so I'm thinking
the qualifications must be

cowardice and bully...ish...
- Ness.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.863
- Sure.
I mean, why do these

05:29.897 --> 05:31.599
middle-aged men
get to tell us

05:31.632 --> 05:33.467
how to manage
our breast health?

05:33.501 --> 05:36.136
Do we tell them how to manage
their testicle wellness?

05:36.169 --> 05:37.905
- Not me.
- And, you know, for some reason

05:37.938 --> 05:39.607
it's all about the nipple.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.409
Like, regardless of the law,

05:41.442 --> 05:42.943
a woman's nipple is
still this forbidden zone.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.812
It's ridiculous.

05:44.845 --> 05:45.879
I'm gonna find my way
around it though.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.681
- Oh,
is that what you're doing?

05:47.715 --> 05:49.450
- Yeah.
- You're not texting Adena?

05:49.483 --> 05:50.918
Checking in?
Even though she went back

05:50.951 --> 05:52.920
to Paris to be with
her girlfriend.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.722
- It's like you're a detective,
Tiny Jane.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.590
- Seriously though, what is
going on between you two?

05:56.624 --> 05:58.392
- We're just keeping in touch.

05:58.426 --> 06:02.730
We're keeping it light,
staying friends.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.633
And yes,
we were almost more than that,

06:05.666 --> 06:07.868
but the timing was off,
and we realized it just

06:07.901 --> 06:09.437
wasn't for us right now.

06:09.470 --> 06:10.638
It's not that big of a deal.

06:10.671 --> 06:11.905
It just took you that

06:11.939 --> 06:14.942
gigantic sentence
to explain it?

06:14.975 --> 06:17.878
- I'm gonna back
to freeing the nipple,

06:17.911 --> 06:21.449
which has nothing to do
with me

06:21.482 --> 06:23.183
avoiding thinking about Adena.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.753
- Wow.
Your self-awareness is amazing.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.588
Your parents must be
really good therapists.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.590

06:31.959 --> 06:33.927

we're playing hooky.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.896
- Yeah,
but we're on a coffee run.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.598

I like being outside
of the office with you.

- Yeah, me, too.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.741
- You seem deep in thought.

06:47.775 --> 06:50.210
Everything okay?
- Yeah, I just--I guess

06:50.243 --> 06:52.513
I'm thinking about
how to start off

06:52.546 --> 06:53.914

foot with Oliver.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.016
I want him to see me
as capable of more

06:56.049 --> 06:57.951
than just a coffee run.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.953

you are far more assertive

06:59.987 --> 07:01.722
than you give yourself
credit for.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.024
- Aw.
- After all,

'twas you who made
the first move on me.

07:07.027 --> 07:10.931

It was so mutual.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.600
- [laughs]
Oh, is that what you call it?

07:12.633 --> 07:14.502
Because I was there,
and I specifically remember

07:14.535 --> 07:16.937
you approaching me
with purpose.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.473
- Yes, that's because when
you see a superior in public,

07:19.507 --> 07:21.675
you're supposed
to give a professional hello.

07:21.709 --> 07:24.578
- Well, it was a pro move,
I I'll give you that.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.514
- Hey, do you want to know
a secret about that night?

07:26.547 --> 07:28.015
- Yeah.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.717
- I wasn't actually
there to meet Jane.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.952
I was supposed to be
going on a Tinder date.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.687
- Sutton Brady,
you pretty little liar.

07:33.721 --> 07:36.056
You said that she canceled
on you at the last second.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.991
- Nope, Tinder date.

07:38.025 --> 07:41.261
And I saw him walk into the bar
while we were talking.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.964
- [laughs] No way.
- Yeah, that's why I so deftly

07:43.997 --> 07:45.733
moved you into
a booth in the back.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.000
- Well, see right there?

07:47.034 --> 07:48.636
You are good at
getting what you want.

07:48.669 --> 07:51.471
- I guess I am, huh?

07:56.944 --> 07:59.046
Okay, I really got to go.

hair's not red, right?

08:10.858 --> 08:12.092
- Yes, but it should be.

- Just our second
crisis of the day.

08:19.132 --> 08:21.101
The first one
happened before you got here.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.703
- I will never be
just on time again.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.104
- The jewelry for Wednesday...
- Go on.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.306
- I wanted
to borrow from Paduano,

08:26.339 --> 08:28.008
from their new Rapture line.
- Oh, I love that line.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.578
- We all love that line,
but Felipe Paduano thinks

08:30.611 --> 08:32.713
I buried his last collection
too deep in the book.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.882
He's punishing me now,
not lending me anything.

08:41.622 --> 08:44.892
- He's mad at us. You can't.
- But what if I can?

08:44.925 --> 08:46.794

- Then call the other designers.

you want the pendant.

Let me get it for you.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.703
- Wow.
Gumption.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.605
Why am I not surprised?

08:57.638 --> 08:59.773
Bring me the Paduano pendant,

08:59.807 --> 09:03.076
but none of this
absolves you from any of this.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.012
- Got it.
Thank you, Oliver.

Jenny, hey.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.357
Yeah, I got a new job
and I'm wondering,

09:17.390 --> 09:19.793
do you wanna help me
kick ass at it?

09:19.827 --> 09:23.597
- Michelangelo's sculptures
are anatomically perfect

09:23.631 --> 09:25.699
with the exception
of female breasts.

09:25.733 --> 09:28.101
He was forbidden
from observing them.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.937
That is how old
our schizophrenic

09:29.970 --> 09:31.739
relationship with breasts is.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.807
Even today we deal
with some of the same issues,

09:33.841 --> 09:36.109
but we have to soldier on,
fight the good fight,

09:36.143 --> 09:38.111
especially where
breast health is concerned.

09:38.145 --> 09:41.581
So does anybody
have a new angle there?

09:42.683 --> 09:44.752
- I met a female
doctor who thought,

09:44.785 --> 09:47.187
with the right family history,
women should be offered

09:47.220 --> 09:50.090
genetic testing for mutations
in the BRCA genes--

09:50.123 --> 09:52.993
the BRCA genes,
as early as their 20s.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.962
- That's way too young.
- Why do you think that?

09:54.995 --> 09:56.964
- Well, actually,
a lot of people do.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.966
She's taken a lot of flak
for giving a preventative

09:58.999 --> 10:01.134
double mastectomy
to a woman in her 20s.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.170
- In her 20s?

10:03.203 --> 10:05.739
That's so irresponsible.
- Is it?

10:05.773 --> 10:07.641
I think we need to find out.

10:07.675 --> 10:11.378
Jane, go see her.
- Yeah, but what about Alex?

10:11.411 --> 10:13.146
- What about Alex?
You're a woman in your 20s.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.181
You'll have
a better handle on this.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.016
- Yeah, but it's his story.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.084
- Alex doesn't have a problem
with this,

10:17.117 --> 10:18.686
right?
- Mm-mm.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.087
- I like that you have
an opinion.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.889
Go in.
Ask her the tough questions.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.892
So what's next?
Sage, what do you have for me?

10:27.260 --> 10:29.763

name is Elysa Hendricks.

She is intense.

the Paduano necklace.

get into details.

that going to see

the BRCA doctor is a good idea?
- Yes, it's fine.

11:49.810 --> 11:50.911
I'm fine.
- You sure?

11:50.944 --> 11:52.312
- Yeah. It's an article.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.781
I'm gonna write it.
I write articles.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.016
That's what I do.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.786
So do I have permission to go?

11:58.819 --> 12:01.855
- Yeah, we were just thinking,
you know, while you're there,

12:01.889 --> 12:03.991
maybe you could, um...
ask the doctor

12:04.024 --> 12:06.960
about getting the test.

12:06.994 --> 12:09.429

you have a 50% chance
of having it.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.109

12:22.142 --> 12:23.877
your lifetime chance
of getting breast cancer

12:23.911 --> 12:27.347

12:29.149 --> 12:31.919
- Okay.
- It seems aggressive.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.121
- Cancer is aggressive,
so I am, too.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.056
- Some would call it
irresponsibly aggressive.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.991
- I get the impression
you are one of those people.

12:38.025 --> 12:40.460
- The stats you gave me
are for your whole lifetime.

12:40.493 --> 12:43.463
The chances of developing it
before 30 are much smaller,

12:43.496 --> 12:45.933
so to put a woman in her 20s
through this, why?

12:45.966 --> 12:49.336
What if a cure is found
before then or a better test?

Why put them through the worry
when there's nothing to be done?

12:51.972 --> 12:55.943

questions is prevention.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.946
Prevention is always
better than treatment,

12:58.979 --> 13:01.014

on the street the same question.

when she was diagnosed?

You're not the doctor,
she is,

that young women

17:41.394 --> 17:43.130

It's ridiculous.

even know about you?

Anything?
Your secrets?

No, of course not because
that's not how this works.

Not me. I don't.
That was a joke.

somewhere in Midtown.

on Jacqueline Carlyle.

It's okay.

gonna get fired, okay?

You're not.

You are too talented

It's not in my pocket.

left something in a cab,

you have a lost and found.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.949

No, stay home.

don't remember the cab company?

we still need the cab number.

nothing to me about Jane.

I have no idea
what she's gonna do.

So how much is
the necklace worth?

22:19.539 --> 22:20.640
About $5,000.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.108
- Well, there's only
one thing to do.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.010
Report it.
- I can't do that.

every woman, Jane.

You need control.

strongly consider

to know how scary this is.

not to steal stuff in New York.

not stealing stuff?

are security cameras everywhere.

flagged and taken down.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.973

It shouldn't have happened.

have a problem with that.

Brendan was one of them.

Kat, but one more

28:49.461 --> 28:50.462
and they'll shut down
the account.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.098
- They can't do that.

28:52.131 --> 28:53.465

crowdsourced compliance.

to lose that account

I'm sorry,

29:10.516 --> 29:12.218

that we play by the rules

- We understand.

29:14.286 --> 29:18.090
Thank you, Richard.

I don't think this
is about women's health

against the board.

- No buts.

Richard was right
about Instagram.

29:40.046 --> 29:42.381
We reach a lot
of women with that account,

29:42.414 --> 29:44.283

taken down.

to raise awareness.

29:46.185 --> 29:48.154
- Then raise it,
but remember that there are

29:48.187 --> 29:50.522
a lot of young women out there
at risk for breast cancer

29:50.556 --> 29:54.160
who are wrestling with
what is a horrible decision,

29:54.193 --> 29:56.162
and I don't think they need us
up in their face

29:56.195 --> 29:59.298
telling them what to do.

29:59.331 --> 30:01.533
They need our support

30:01.567 --> 30:03.402
and our understanding.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.473
And you know one of 'em.

- Sutton?
Where the hell is that girl?

30:17.316 --> 30:19.351
How long does it take
to get something cleaned?

30:23.222 --> 30:25.057
- Are you joking?

30:25.091 --> 30:27.159
- Can't give you video.
Can't reveal my customers.

30:27.193 --> 30:29.261
- Dude, this is a dry cleaners,
not a strip club.

30:29.295 --> 30:34.166
Who cares?
Ugh.

30:34.200 --> 30:38.437
Okay, we're gonna have
to scare him.

30:38.470 --> 30:39.571
- Scare him?
- Yeah.

30:39.605 --> 30:41.307
Like, threaten him or something.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.609
- You want me
to threaten a dry cleaner?

30:43.642 --> 30:47.279
- No.
Yes. I'm insane.

30:47.313 --> 30:50.549
- You're not insane.
Desperate.

30:50.582 --> 30:52.184
Let me think of something.

I have to get this.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.856

we're gonna get this tape.

31:01.327 --> 31:03.129
- Hi.
- You're not at work.

31:03.162 --> 31:06.332
- No, I'm at a dry cleaner
on 41st and 6th.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.267
I think that the security camera
might've caught my cab.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.269
- Sutton, what are you doing?

31:10.302 --> 31:11.470
- It's fine. Oliver thinks
that I'm just getting

31:11.503 --> 31:13.339
the necklace cleaned.
- No.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.174
No, he's annoyed
that you're not at your desk.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.576
I just walked by.
- Oh, crap.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.345
Look, if I could just get
this guy to show me

31:19.378 --> 31:20.646
the security footage,
I can fix this.

31:20.679 --> 31:22.381
- I don't think
this is a good idea.

31:22.414 --> 31:25.084
You should get
back to the office.

You still there?
- I need to do this, Richard.

you still work here.

32:06.692 --> 32:10.296
- No.
- Let me finish.

32:10.329 --> 32:13.432
I know I've been pushing you.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.968
It's really easy for me
to tell everyone else to go

32:16.002 --> 32:19.171
and get their breasts checked,
but I'm not in your position.

32:22.341 --> 32:25.211
You know why I
do it though, right?

32:25.244 --> 32:28.514
- 'Cause you want
what's best for me.

32:28.547 --> 32:31.150

really want what's best for me.

It says do not duplicate.
- Yeah, so?

33:15.561 --> 33:17.296
- Last week,
you duplicated it.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.497
- So?
- See, I went on a date

33:18.530 --> 33:20.332
with this girl,
she was crazy.

She stole this key and copied it
here at this store.

look at those tapes.

to call my lawyer right now.

He's telling the truth.

33:47.793 --> 33:50.729

- Seriously?

33:50.762 --> 33:52.464
What's the point
of even having the inscription?

33:52.498 --> 33:54.633
- I know.
Listen, sir, I don't know

33:54.666 --> 33:57.403

will you get out of here?

being too tough on you?

- Oh, no, he's not.

Thanks for asking.
- Good. Alex, right?

40:46.512 --> 40:47.546
- Plus, who knows
what kind of treatments

40:47.579 --> 40:49.748
they'll have in 5 years?
- In 10.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.483
- In 20,
we're all gonna be robots.

40:51.517 --> 40:55.487
- Yeah, fully bionic, baby.

40:55.521 --> 40:57.088
It's a killer day, huh?

40:57.122 --> 41:00.626
- Yeah,
it couldn't be better.

41:00.659 --> 41:03.495
- All right.
You guys ready?

41:03.529 --> 41:05.664
- Mm-hmm.

41:05.697 --> 41:08.033
- Me, too.

41:08.066 --> 41:11.637
All right,
three, two, one.

41:11.670 --> 41:13.505
*

41:13.539 --> 41:18.243
- * Hearts decomposed

41:18.276 --> 41:21.513
* And bound to be broken

41:21.547 --> 41:23.582
- You're right.
This does feel great.

41:23.615 --> 41:25.684
- Mm-hmm.
- Did anyone bring sunscreen?

41:25.717 --> 41:27.185
- Ooh, sunscreen.
Good idea.

41:27.218 --> 41:29.120
- Want me
to put it on you?

41:29.154 --> 41:31.289
- Out here?
We don't want to cause a riot.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.558
- Oh, sure we do.
