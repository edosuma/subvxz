WEBVTT

00:03.337 --> 00:05.806
(thunder and wind)

00:07.040 --> 00:08.509
GORDON: Bloody hell.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.145
Look what's happening
to the road down here.

00:12.145 --> 00:14.081
It's disintegrated,
literally into a river.

00:16.083 --> 00:18.118
Look at that. (Bleep).

00:20.420 --> 00:22.256
The actual bridge is
filling up with water as well.

00:24.424 --> 00:26.560
I've never seen a river
running across the bridge

00:27.361 --> 00:29.696
and a massive river
running under the bridge.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.832
Look at that river down there.
Holy mackerel.

00:33.233 --> 00:34.968
Don't wanna hang around
here long, trust me.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.672
Otherwise, I'll
be (bleep) toast.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.751
This is the untamed corner
of Hawaii, the Hana Coast.

00:52.286 --> 00:56.623
I'm 2,500 miles
out in the Pacific,
on the Hawaiian Islands,

00:57.190 --> 00:59.359
exploring Maui's
rugged Hana Coast.

01:00.294 --> 01:02.396
It's home to an
incredible culinary culture.

01:04.798 --> 01:10.003
Here, Hawaiian's staggering
array of unique indigenous
ingredients rubs shoulders

01:10.003 --> 01:13.240
with exotic foods,
brought here by immigrants
from across the world.

01:14.441 --> 01:17.711
I've heard the results
are mind‐blowing and
to find out first hand,

01:17.711 --> 01:20.514
I'm meeting trailblazing
local chef, Sheldon Simeon.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.786
So excited to be here,
look at this coastline.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.854
SHELDON: Yeah,
this is amazing, right?

01:28.288 --> 01:31.291
Voyagers came here,
using the wind, the stars,

01:31.892 --> 01:34.962
the birds and they
found this magical place.

01:36.196 --> 01:38.031
GORDON: Appropriately,
for the home of surfing,

01:38.031 --> 01:41.735
Sheldon's been making
waves with his modern spin
on classic Hawaiian dishes.

01:42.803 --> 01:46.573
His two restaurants showcase
the best of the island's
diverse multi‐culture cuisine

01:47.174 --> 01:50.911
and trust me, there's
a lot more going on here, than
chucking pineapple on a pizza.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.580
(laughs).

01:55.248 --> 01:57.584
SHELDON: Everyone's not
really from Hawaii, everyone
had to come from somewhere,

01:57.584 --> 02:00.454
and my grandparents came
from the Philippines when
they were just teenagers.

02:01.588 --> 02:03.657
The trade winds brings
all these different cultures

02:03.657 --> 02:05.659
and they kind of
seamlessly melt together.

02:05.659 --> 02:08.729
GORDON: What does this
part of the island mean
for you, food wise?

02:09.596 --> 02:13.266
SHELDON: The families that
live here, they don't have the
convenience of going down to

02:13.266 --> 02:15.836
the local supermarket,
so they get everything
from the ocean,

02:16.403 --> 02:18.338
foraging from the mountains.

02:18.338 --> 02:21.942
Everyone knows where
the refrigerators are and
they're right in the rocks.

02:22.376 --> 02:25.445
GORDON: So, we are on
uncharted territory right now,
this is off the beaten track.

02:25.445 --> 02:29.016
SHELDON: Yeah. Well,
we're excited to show you
and you got a lot to see

02:29.016 --> 02:31.885
and a lot to discover,
and we're gonna
start right now, Chef.

02:32.185 --> 02:33.787
We're gonna
meet some foragers.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.789
GORDON: Are these your boys?
SHELDON: These are my boys.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.357
GORDON: Hi, guys.
MAN: Hi.

02:37.357 --> 02:40.494
GORDON: Ina and Alan are
the kings of harvesting
Hawaii's unique sea life.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.597
They're gonna show me
where the bounty's hidden.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.499
MAN: Do you reckon
you'd jump in the water?

02:45.499 --> 02:46.667
GORDON: Yeah,
where do we start?

02:46.667 --> 02:48.068
MAN: Let's go down here.
GORDON: Okay, I'll follow you.

02:48.068 --> 02:49.603
SHELDON: Alright, Chef, I'm
gonna leave you guys to it.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.304
GORDON: Thank you.

03:00.647 --> 03:04.184
To gather spiky sea urchins,
the guys carry everyone's
favorite rhyming tools,

03:04.618 --> 03:06.687
homemade prongs and
old chef's tongues,

03:07.254 --> 03:10.657
as well as blades to
prise shellfish from
the rocky shoreline.

03:25.372 --> 03:29.743
A recent downpour has cut
visibility to almost nothing,
so I'm really struggling.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.514
Lucky for me, the boys
have found a sixth
sense for seafood.

03:35.415 --> 03:39.720
Alan finds sea urchin,
or Wana, and Ina bags a
delicious spiny lobster.

03:42.522 --> 03:45.392
GORDON: Look at this.
That's incredible.

03:47.094 --> 03:48.195
Man, that was tough.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.362
MAN: Oh, yeah.

03:49.362 --> 03:51.264
GORDON: Great job.
A tough snorkel.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.167
Visibility's difficult, but
what a bounty of ingredients.

03:57.671 --> 04:00.173
Sheldon, that was
magical in there.

04:00.874 --> 04:03.510
SHELDON: Oh, I'm just
enjoy here on the beach.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.412
You guys got some stuff, huh?

04:05.412 --> 04:06.446
Awesome.

04:06.446 --> 04:08.081
GORDON: Oh, no,
it was a great job.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.284
SHELDON: You guys got some
sea urchin, some lobster,
some Wana and some Opihi.

04:12.018 --> 04:13.954
GORDON: Yeah, I'm dying
to taste those things.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.623
And, I'm not alone,
Opihi are a protected species,

04:17.190 --> 04:19.292
that can only be harvested
above a certain size,

04:19.860 --> 04:22.329
so I let the boys take
care of that delicate task.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.231
Guys, thank you.

04:24.231 --> 04:25.999
Good to see you,
great job, thank you.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.300
MAN: You guys have fun.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.536
GORDON: Decent
sized lobsters, huh?

04:30.036 --> 04:32.806
SHELDON: Yeah, so in Hawaii,
it's all spiny lobsters,
they don't have the claws.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.876
How about we taste
some of this Opihi?

04:36.610 --> 04:38.145
GORDON: So, how would you cook
that, would you grill them?

04:38.145 --> 04:40.247
SHELDON: Oh, you would
grill them, but I like 'em
just actually like this.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.082
GORDON: What, raw like this?

04:42.082 --> 04:43.850
SHELDON: Raw, like this.
So take another one.

04:43.850 --> 04:47.187
I actually got some
handpicked salt here.

04:48.054 --> 04:49.356
GORDON: Wow.

04:49.356 --> 04:52.692
SHELDON: You can
see that it's stained,
from the lava rocks.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.563
But we'll take the smaller
one and then kind of
use that as the shucker.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.266
GORDON: Oh, I see.
SHELDON: To get it out.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.401
GORDON: Got ya. And then
the whole thing goes in?

05:01.835 --> 05:04.037
SHELDON: Yeah, the
whole thing goes in there.

05:04.271 --> 05:05.572
GORDON: That as
well, everything?

05:05.572 --> 05:07.741
SHELDON: All of it, Chef.
GORDON: Cheers, bud.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.443
SHELDON: Cheers.
GORDON: Ah, they're delicious.

05:12.212 --> 05:16.283
You can taste that sweet
crunchy creamy flavor.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.251
SHELDON: Yeah.

05:18.251 --> 05:21.388
GORDON: And all that natural
saltiness, not just the
seawater, but your salt,

05:21.388 --> 05:24.057
just lifts that
to another level.

05:25.692 --> 05:27.460
Mmm, that's delicious.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.763
SHELDON: It's only a small
little part of what Hawaii is.

05:29.763 --> 05:30.831
GORDON: Right.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.566
SHELDON: There's
a lot to discover.

05:32.566 --> 05:36.736
The first indigenous food
were from the Polynesian that
came and found the islands.

05:36.736 --> 05:38.171
GORDON: Right.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.674
SHELDON: And then
the next influx of people,
like my grandparents,

05:40.674 --> 05:44.211
who came to work on the
sugar cane field and brought
all their different culture.

05:44.211 --> 05:47.781
GORDON: So, if you
look at the base of the
DNA of Hawaiian food,

05:48.281 --> 05:49.482
it's a melting pot.

05:49.482 --> 05:51.284
SHELDON: Every time
somebody leaves their marks,

05:51.284 --> 05:54.588
it's one layer of deliciousness
that's added to it.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.893
GORDON: As the latest
arrival on these shores,

05:59.893 --> 06:02.395
I'm dying to add
to the melting pot,

06:02.395 --> 06:05.031
and Sheldon tells me,
I'll get a golden opportunity.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.201
SHELDON: I've set up this
feast that we're gonna
feed the locals here

06:08.201 --> 06:09.870
and you're gonna
cook for them.

06:09.870 --> 06:14.741
GORDON: Wow. So, a big
feast at the end of the
week for these families?

06:15.308 --> 06:18.879
SHELDON: Yeah, and
bring a little bit of
your history to it.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.248
GORDON: Sounds
fascinating, thank you.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.683
I'm about to start
this incredible journey,

06:23.683 --> 06:25.919
but if this is what
the beginning's like,

06:25.919 --> 06:28.889
can you imagine what
kind of treat I'm in for,

06:29.222 --> 06:31.124
by the time we get
to the end of the week?

06:31.124 --> 06:34.127
If I'm gonna add a pinch
of my Scottish heritage
to this Hawaiian banquet,

06:34.127 --> 06:37.497
I've got to come up
with something better than
haggis on a pineapple ring.

06:38.632 --> 06:41.034
I've definitely
got my work cut out.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.677
So, I'm hitting the island's
coast road for inspiration,

06:50.677 --> 06:52.812
but I've got to be careful,
this road hits back.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.883
GORDON: One of the
most dangerous drives
anywhere in the world.

06:57.584 --> 07:03.223
Really tight, windy roads,
add the rain to that
and you're in hot water.

07:05.091 --> 07:08.628
Apparently, in the sunshine,
the views are breathtaking,
but Maui is one of the

07:08.628 --> 07:11.331
rainiest places on earth,
so I think I'll be doing

07:11.331 --> 07:13.400
more hydroplaning than
sightseeing this week.

07:15.635 --> 07:19.239
GORDON: Flooding everywhere,
and look, bits of trees
floating down the road.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.743
These roads are so slippery.

07:27.781 --> 07:31.818
All this heavy rain makes
me think of two words,
British Summertime.

07:32.218 --> 07:33.954
I need a pit stop.

07:34.187 --> 07:38.158
Now, they say that the
Huli Huli Chicken Shack is one
of the most sought‐after sort

07:38.158 --> 07:41.795
of road side dishes
to pick up on route.

07:43.029 --> 07:48.435
So, this is it, and
I'm dying to see what
all the fuss is about.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.841
With its sauce created by a
Portuguese American local,
using his mother's recipe,

07:56.042 --> 07:58.578
Huli Huli chicken is a
typically crossed cultural dish.

07:59.245 --> 08:02.148
The main man
here is a local legend,
known as Uncle Russell.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.617
They look incredible.

08:04.617 --> 08:05.986
Now, everybody's talking
about this chicken.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.787
What is so special about it?

08:07.787 --> 08:10.023
UNCLE RUSSELL: Well,
you know, the Huli is a
Hawaiian word for turn.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.025
Watch this.
Did you see that?

08:12.592 --> 08:14.327
GORDON: I missed it.
UNCLE RUSSELL: That's a Huli.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.729
GORDON: That's a Huli.

08:15.729 --> 08:18.131
UNCLE RUSSELL: When
you do it again, what
do you get? Huli Huli.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.966
GORDON: Huli Huli.

08:19.966 --> 08:21.901
UNCLE RUSSELL: Yeah, Huli
Huli chicken is a barbecue
chicken Hawaiian style.

08:21.901 --> 08:24.270
GORDON: The color they
are already, is it brine,
did you marinate it?

08:24.270 --> 08:27.307
UNCLE RUSSELL: What we do, we
marinate it with Hawaiian salt

08:27.307 --> 08:30.643
and we let it sit
overnight and then we put
a secret sauce on there.

08:31.911 --> 08:32.946
GORDON: May I have a smell?

08:32.946 --> 08:34.114
UNCLE RUSSELL: Yes.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.415
GORDON: But, there's
a secret combination there,

08:35.415 --> 08:36.783
you're not gonna share
it with me, are you?

08:36.783 --> 08:38.218
UNCLE RUSSELL:
No, of course not.

08:38.218 --> 08:42.822
GORDON: Bloody hell.
That smells. That's intense.
This is beautiful.

08:43.690 --> 08:44.858
UNCLE RUSSELL: Nice.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.393
GORDON: I love the way
you're caramelizing that.

08:46.393 --> 08:49.162
Can I just say, I
mean, the power of this
grill is extraordinary.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.731
UNCLE RUSSELL: You look
like a natural here, you
sure you don't wanna stay

08:51.731 --> 08:53.366
and help me cook the
rest of this chicken?

08:53.366 --> 08:56.102
GORDON: I'd love to, but
I've got a long journey.

08:57.937 --> 08:59.539
What is that, window cleaner?

08:59.539 --> 09:01.775
(coughs).

09:01.775 --> 09:04.444
UNCLE RUSSELL: No,
we squirt our sauce in
there and we... (coughs).

09:04.978 --> 09:06.212
GORDON: (Bleep)!

09:06.212 --> 09:07.447
Is there alcohol in there?

09:07.447 --> 09:09.049
UNCLE RUSSELL: No,
but it should be.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.317
And then these birds
are ready to come off.

09:11.317 --> 09:12.819
I really appreciate
the free labor.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.988
GORDON: I don't mind
helping, but I got a
busy day ahead of me.

09:15.855 --> 09:17.357
(laughs).

09:20.393 --> 09:21.628
GORDON: What's the secret
behind this chicken?

09:21.628 --> 09:23.296
UNCLE RUSSELL: The
secret is to go slow.

09:23.296 --> 09:24.364
GORDON: Go slow.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.066
UNCLE RUSSELL: Just
take your time.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.202
I know you're in a rush,
Gordon, but you just need to
slow down, because in Hawaii,

09:29.202 --> 09:30.870
we go on Hawaiian time.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.405
You wanna try
some of my chicken?

09:32.405 --> 09:34.140
GORDON: I'd love
to, yes, please.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.175
Keep up the good work.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.509
UNCLE RUSSELL: Thank you.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.211
GORDON: And when you're
hiring, yeah, I'll be back.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.046
UNCLE RUSSELL: Okay.
GORDON: Okay, good man.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.449
Wow, talk about
dinner with a view.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.289
You don't need a knife
and fork for this, look at
the color of those wings.

09:55.662 --> 09:57.363
Delicious.

09:57.363 --> 10:00.600
I've seen chefs that have
spent thousands of dollars on
the most expensive rotisseries,

10:00.600 --> 10:03.803
that have got nowhere
near the flavor in the chicken
that I've just experienced.

10:04.704 --> 10:08.575
Tasting the trade winds come
to life, and this Portuguese
inspired Hawaiian dish has

10:08.575 --> 10:12.245
really got me thinking about
how I might put my spin on the
feast at the end of the week.

10:24.090 --> 10:28.061
The sun's back, for now,
but I've no time to tan,
like a rotisserie chicken.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.864
I need to crack on,
exploring the island's
food, for my feast.

10:32.398 --> 10:35.535
So, Sheldon's arranged for
me to meet Kimi Werner,

10:35.535 --> 10:37.837
she's a chef and a
world class free diver.

10:37.837 --> 10:39.906
Only in Hawaii.

10:39.906 --> 10:42.442
Now, they say she's one of
the best divers on the planet.

10:42.442 --> 10:45.612
This lady can hold her
breath for up to five minutes.

10:46.513 --> 10:52.152
And, for me, the exciting part
is that she's gonna teach me
how to hunt, right down there.

10:53.419 --> 10:55.155
And I can't wait.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.730
I can't believe
the color of this.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.832
KIMI: It's so gorgeous.
GORDON: Oh my God.

11:09.602 --> 11:11.337
Kimi's taking me
to the fishing grounds,

11:11.337 --> 11:13.973
15 miles along the
spectacular Hana coastline.

11:18.545 --> 11:21.814
Free diving, with
no air tanks, makes me
nervous, but I'm pumped,

11:22.549 --> 11:25.285
which is only gonna make
it harder to hold my breath.

11:27.053 --> 11:28.688
The secret of
controlling our breath.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.624
I mean, you do it for
just under five minutes.

11:31.624 --> 11:35.795
As a novice, what's
the fast track secret?

11:36.829 --> 11:39.098
KIMI: Above all,
it's relaxation.

11:39.966 --> 11:43.436
If you can turn yourself
into a docile stingray,
this is in the bag.

11:44.470 --> 11:48.241
Don't wait until you
think you're gonna die
and then you need oxygen.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.711
To do the job,
we need to be calm.

11:51.711 --> 11:55.114
GORDON: If I see a shark,
trust me, that's gonna be
hard for me to stay calm.

11:55.114 --> 11:57.183
KIMI: Just kind of nudge it.

11:57.183 --> 11:58.851
GORDON: Nudge it.
KIMI: Just nudge it.

11:58.851 --> 12:01.221
GORDON: Just nudge it.
KIMI: Gently, hold
your ground.

12:01.654 --> 12:02.989
GORDON: (Bleep).

12:02.989 --> 12:05.058
KIMI: You're good at
that, right, gently
holding your ground?

12:05.058 --> 12:07.193
GORDON: Yes, but on top of
the water, not underneath.

12:07.193 --> 12:08.828
Are they around this
time of year here?

12:08.828 --> 12:11.898
KIMI: I mean, yeah.
That's the ocean.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.171
Okay, so this is
going to be your tool.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.772
GORDON: Yeah.

12:19.772 --> 12:22.175
KIMI: So, this is your
trigger mechanism, obviously,
and when you see a fish,

12:22.175 --> 12:25.178
you're gonna look
right down your shaft.

12:25.645 --> 12:26.779
Pull the trigger.

12:26.779 --> 12:28.281
GORDON: Got ya.

12:28.281 --> 12:31.951
KIMI: Try not to take a
shot, unless you feel this
buzz in your finger,

12:32.318 --> 12:36.155
you feel this natural instinct,
you feel this confidence that
just says, I've got this.

12:36.155 --> 12:39.025
If there's any
question in your mind,
do not take a hail Mary,

12:39.492 --> 12:41.995
because you're
just gonna scare away
the whole school of fish.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.331
GORDON: Yeah.
KIMI: Let's do it.

12:45.698 --> 12:47.433
GORDON: Yeah.

13:03.650 --> 13:06.019
I've heard sharks
can sense fear.

13:06.019 --> 13:11.324
Right now, I must be lit up
like a neon sign at a roadside
diner and I'm dish of the day.

13:24.103 --> 13:27.307
GORDON: Spearfishing
in Hawaii, I'm like
a fish out of water.

13:27.707 --> 13:30.710
Thank God I've got
free diving champ,
Kimi, for a guide.

13:32.011 --> 13:34.013
She makes it look so easy.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.353
Damn, she's good.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.458
Despite my fetching
camouflage, I
can't hit a thing.

13:48.728 --> 13:51.097
KIMI: You were that
close, that close.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.298
Don't get frustrated.

13:52.298 --> 13:53.700
GORDON: Oh, man.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.335
KIMI: Like, really,
you're almost there.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.170
That was a good fish too.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.640
GORDON: How do you keep your
breath under such control.

14:00.640 --> 14:04.610
'Cause you're holding onto
the seabed, you've got
the spear in the other.

14:05.378 --> 14:09.349
KIMI: And the current
is pushing you back and
forth, the entire time,

14:10.116 --> 14:11.851
so it's a lot of work.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.786
GORDON: Right, here we go.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.988
KIMI: That was
awesome, though.

14:24.097 --> 14:27.767
GORDON: Right, hold my breath.
Line up my sights.

14:30.837 --> 14:33.039
This is just like
shooting fish in a barrel,

14:33.306 --> 14:37.543
a very big Pacific Ocean
sized barrel. Bingo.

14:48.888 --> 14:52.191
KIMI: Awesome.
GORDON: Got a beauty.

14:53.126 --> 14:56.262
I held onto the rock, bent
round the corner, and just
waited for him to pop up.

14:56.262 --> 14:58.798
KIMI: Oh, that was awesome.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.802
GORDON: Woo! I don't
wanna come out.
Amazing, honestly.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.570
(sighs).

15:04.570 --> 15:05.838
What a teacher.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.240
It makes you want
to live underwater.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.408
It's that exciting.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.776
You don't wanna come up.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.177
I wanna go back again.

15:11.177 --> 15:13.012
KIMI: This is an Ana Nui.

15:13.012 --> 15:14.380
GORDON: Ana Nui?
KIMI: Yeah.

15:14.380 --> 15:15.915
GORDON: Did you grow up
eating fish like this?

15:15.915 --> 15:18.351
KIMI: My dad would go
spear fishing to put
food on the table

15:18.351 --> 15:20.386
and this is one of the
main fish that he fed us.

15:20.386 --> 15:21.988
GORDON: Wow, how cool.
Beautiful.

15:21.988 --> 15:23.489
So you literally eat this raw?

15:23.489 --> 15:25.591
KIMI: We always would
eat this fish raw.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.427
This fish eats a
lot of seaweed and so,

15:27.427 --> 15:30.096
it tastes different all on
different parts of the island,

15:30.396 --> 15:32.698
depending on what type of
seaweed is growing there.

15:32.698 --> 15:34.467
GORDON: Thank you. Wow.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.103
KIMI: Can you taste that?

15:37.103 --> 15:39.806
GORDON: That was delicious
and it does taste a little bit
seaweedy, a little bit salty.

15:39.806 --> 15:42.408
KIMI: Ah‐hmm.
A lot of times we
add seaweed for flavor.

15:42.408 --> 15:43.910
GORDON: Yeah.

15:43.910 --> 15:46.579
KIMI: With this fish,
it's already pre‐seasoned,
because of it's diet.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.651
GORDON: I mean, it was
like the perfect trip to any
fishmonger you'll ever go to,

15:52.018 --> 15:53.553
your entire life.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.721
I didn't think it would
taste that good and my
God, without any dressing,

15:56.255 --> 15:58.491
without any chili,
or any soy.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.860
And so, that's got me
thinking now, you know,

16:00.860 --> 16:04.230
do I make this feast
predominantly around
the fish locally,

16:04.530 --> 16:06.966
or is it meat right now?

16:07.767 --> 16:09.435
Honestly, I'm
spoiled for choice.

16:16.008 --> 16:19.245
One thing's for sure, a
fish that seasons itself
is a new one on me.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.616
If only it could catch
itself and cook itself,
I'd be laughing.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.352
But with my feast now,
just three days away,

16:26.352 --> 16:29.288
it's time to widen
my search for some
incredible ingredients.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.124
So, I'm gonna
meet a local farmer,

16:32.124 --> 16:35.027
who's an expert in Hawaii's
most famous native dish, poi.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.331
Wade, good morning.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.765
WADE: Oh, what's up, bro?

16:39.765 --> 16:41.834
GORDON: The king of poi,
good to see you, bud.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.270
WADE: Oh, good to see you.
GORDON: Absolute pleasure.

16:44.470 --> 16:45.938
WADE: Now, we're
blood brothers.

16:45.938 --> 16:47.607
GORDON: Now, we're what?

16:47.607 --> 16:50.109
WADE: We're mud brothers.
GORDON: Mud brothers. Thank you.

16:50.743 --> 16:53.079
How long every day, do
you spend in that mud bath?

16:53.079 --> 16:55.014
WADE: Three or
four hours a day. Yeah.

16:59.752 --> 17:03.022
GORDON: Poi is made from
taro plants, which were first
brought to these islands by

17:03.022 --> 17:05.358
the Polynesians,
around 1,000 years ago.

17:07.159 --> 17:09.495
GORDON: (Bleep). It's slidey.
It's like a mud bath.

17:10.129 --> 17:12.098
The mud is pretty
tough to deal with.

17:12.098 --> 17:13.366
Much like Wade's laugh.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.001
GORDON: Ah, come on, (bleep).

17:15.001 --> 17:18.838
But, he's gonna be showing
me taro picking, which
requires a special skill.

17:19.305 --> 17:20.606
WADE: You know karate?
GORDON: Yes.

17:20.606 --> 17:23.609
WADE: Oh, side kick it.
GORDON: Side kick it there?

17:23.843 --> 17:25.344
WADE: Yeah.
GORDON: So you put
your foot down first?

17:25.344 --> 17:26.913
WADE: Yeah,
and then, your heel.

17:26.913 --> 17:29.582
Heel, toe. Yeah,
and you push 'em under.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.150
GORDON: Why are
you doing that?

17:31.150 --> 17:32.718
WADE: 'Cause otherwise
it'll break inside.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.253
Then you got
only half the taro.

17:34.253 --> 17:36.122
Then you gotta
dig with your hand.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.857
GORDON: This is true.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.026
So you're using the base of
your heel, to snap the roots.

17:40.026 --> 17:42.628
WADE: Right. Come on,
boy, let's go.

17:42.628 --> 17:45.097
GORDON: I know, I know, I'm
trying to get the, I'm trying
to get the mother one, here.

17:45.097 --> 17:46.566
WADE: This can't
be that hard, bro.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.435
Step up, yeah, like this,
push 'em, put your toe open.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.571
GORDON: So you put
it between your toes.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.439
WADE: With your toe and
you step and knock 'em over.

17:53.439 --> 17:56.208
Push 'em.
There you go, boy!

17:56.442 --> 17:59.612
(Bleep), we're gonna make a
farmer out of you yet, bro.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.881
GORDON: And pull up
with the roots, right?

18:01.881 --> 18:04.250
WADE: Yeah, and you always
wash and rinse and rinse 'em.

18:04.450 --> 18:06.986
That's correct.
Clean 'em good now.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.755
GORDON: Look at the color
of my (bleep) toes, man,
what have you done to me?

18:09.755 --> 18:12.158
WADE: You know, the people they
pay big money for mud baths,

18:12.658 --> 18:14.560
you're getting free, bro.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.464
WADE: That's enough,
that's plenty.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.433
GORDON: What a
technique though.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.535
(Bleep). That's amazing.

18:27.840 --> 18:31.877
We karate chopped our taro
from the mud bath, but they're
a long way from becoming poi.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.914
First, they must spend a
few hours in Wade's steamer.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.584
At least there, they
can't hear his laugh.

18:39.251 --> 18:41.420
GORDON: Obviously, if the
skins are nice and warm.

18:41.420 --> 18:42.622
WADE: Right.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.923
GORDON: They come off
relatively easy, right?

18:43.923 --> 18:45.992
WADE: Right.
It's like a potato.

18:45.992 --> 18:47.526
GORDON: And what
would you eat it with?

18:47.526 --> 18:49.428
WADE: Corned beef.
GORDON: Right.

18:49.428 --> 18:51.731
It's almost like your
mashed potato, then?

18:51.731 --> 18:53.933
WADE: Right.
GORDON: Yeah?
WADE: Right.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.470
GORDON: Yeah.
Packed with starch.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.671
Is it healthy?

18:58.671 --> 19:00.840
WADE: Oh, yeah.
You can eat nine
pounds of poi a day.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.675
GORDON: Stop it.
WADE: And don't get fat.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.110
GORDON: Stop it.
WADE: Mmm‐hmm.

19:04.110 --> 19:05.711
GORDON: You've hardly
got a six pack.

19:05.711 --> 19:09.281
So, we've steamed them,
we've cleaned them,
what do we do next?

19:09.615 --> 19:11.550
WADE: Now, we go inside.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.422
GORDON: Peeling these with
you reminds me of peeling
potatoes with my grandma.

19:17.256 --> 19:18.924
WADE: I don't look
like her, huh?

19:20.292 --> 19:22.194
GORDON: No, but
you sound like her.

19:24.730 --> 19:26.532
So, what happens next?
What is this contraption?

19:30.002 --> 19:31.137
GORDON: We put them in there?

19:31.137 --> 19:32.972
WADE: And you hold on the
top here, you just press.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.008
You go slow and every now and
then, you grab a little water.

19:36.475 --> 19:38.010
GORDON: Got ya.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.713
WADE: And then you push
'em all the way down till
you hit, there you go.

19:40.913 --> 19:41.947
Coming out.

19:41.947 --> 19:44.550
GORDON: That's it there.
Look at it.

19:44.550 --> 19:47.953
It's like this big,
thick, gloopy lava.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.089
WADE: That's poi cream,
instead of ice‐cream.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.957
GORDON: Poi cream.
WADE: Poi cream.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.694
GORDON: Now, please
tell me, is that done?

19:55.027 --> 19:56.128
Are we ready now?

19:56.128 --> 19:57.963
WADE: No.
GORDON: Stop it.

19:57.963 --> 19:59.398
WADE: Not yet.
One more thing.

19:59.398 --> 20:00.900
GORDON: Stop it.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.236
WADE: Box 'em in like that.
Box 'em in now, poom, poom.

20:04.503 --> 20:05.871
Smash your hand now.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.741
There you go, that's
the go, that's what
capelli means, boxing.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.042
There, you hear that sound?

20:10.042 --> 20:12.678
Yes, sir, now you
feel 'em, bro. See?

20:13.779 --> 20:15.614
Get your hands in there bro.

20:15.614 --> 20:17.216
GORDON: But it feels
like you're slapping
somebody's arse.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.418
WADE: Whatever it takes, bro.
GORDON: No!

20:20.619 --> 20:23.823
After beating the
poi within an inch of its life.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.592
WADE: But you did good,
bro, you did real good, bro.

20:27.026 --> 20:29.428
GORDON: Last time
I saw a bucket like that,
I was about to wallpaper

20:29.795 --> 20:31.130
and paste my mum's kitchen.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.199
WADE: You know what?
You can use this too, bro.

20:33.199 --> 20:35.034
GORDON: Oh.
WADE: This would good stick.

20:36.001 --> 20:38.137
GORDON: The poi is
finally ready to taste.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.541
WADE: Lovely, right.

20:42.541 --> 20:43.943
I can tell, you're
not saying a word.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.711
GORDON: (Bleep).

20:46.345 --> 20:47.847
'Cause I'm (bleep)
lost for words.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.249
Can we season that
with salt and pepper?

20:51.484 --> 20:53.853
WADE: You can do whatever
you want, but not
over here, that's sacred.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.021
Grandma would turn
over in her grave, bro.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.323
We don't want that
to happen, man.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.858
GORDON: I do not
want that to happen.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.860
Do you think this
work in a dessert?

21:00.860 --> 21:02.294
WADE: Oh, yeah.
Hell, yeah.

21:02.294 --> 21:04.497
We eat everything.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.433
GORDON: Good job, bud,
been an absolute pleasure.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.301
Good to see you, bud.
Thank you so much.

21:09.301 --> 21:10.636
WADE: Yeah, same here, bro.

21:10.636 --> 21:12.838
(speaking in native language).

21:14.974 --> 21:16.909
GORDON: I'm stuck
between a rock and
a hard place right now,

21:16.909 --> 21:20.279
whether it's a dessert,
or do I go down into a savory?

21:20.846 --> 21:25.084
But, when you have
a producer that is still
in love with something,

21:25.885 --> 21:29.255
after decades of making it,
I need to do it justice,
because if I don't,

21:29.255 --> 21:32.358
trust me, not only
will he let me know,
but he'll kick my ass.

21:39.765 --> 21:43.803
Now, I'm still in search
of that incredible centerpiece,

21:44.537 --> 21:49.108
the protein and I'm on my way
to meet an incredible hunter.

21:50.609 --> 21:54.847
The big problem I have,
is that this guy hunts
with a bow and arrow

21:55.548 --> 21:57.817
and I've never done that.

21:57.817 --> 22:01.153
Accurate bowmanship puts
food on the table for
game hunter, Robin Kean.

22:01.654 --> 22:04.523
If I don't embarrass myself,
I'll count that as a win.

22:07.393 --> 22:08.861
Robin. How are you, sir?

22:08.861 --> 22:10.429
ROBIN: I'm doing
well, Mr. Ramsay.

22:10.429 --> 22:13.165
GORDON: They say that you
are the best on the island
with a bow and arrow.

22:13.165 --> 22:16.135
I've never shot these things,
but, we'll hope for what?

22:16.435 --> 22:18.237
ROBIN: Oh, we're
going after Axis deer.

22:18.237 --> 22:19.271
GORDON: Right.

22:19.271 --> 22:21.974
ROBIN: We have goats,
deer and pigs out here,

22:21.974 --> 22:24.143
and they're
all non‐native to the island.

22:24.143 --> 22:25.277
GORDON: Right.

22:25.277 --> 22:26.812
ROBIN: We do have to
bring the numbers down.

22:26.812 --> 22:28.447
They are affecting
the ecosystem.

22:28.447 --> 22:29.949
GORDON: Wow.
So, big nuisances.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.217
ROBIN: Big Nuisances.

22:31.217 --> 22:33.586
Let's gear up
and get out there.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.624
GORDON: Axis deer were
first introduced to Hawaii
as a gift from Hong Kong

22:38.624 --> 22:40.693
to island royalty.

22:41.727 --> 22:43.162
What a view.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.897
ROBIN: Wait till
we get up top.

22:44.897 --> 22:49.034
GORDON: But, with no natural
predators, the population
has exploded and over grazing

22:49.034 --> 22:51.170
badly damages this
beautiful landscape.

22:52.137 --> 22:54.406
Enter Hawaii's
answer to Robin Hood.

22:56.108 --> 22:58.143
ROBIN: Oh, the wind.
The wind's gonna screw us.

22:59.578 --> 23:02.882
GORDON: Why?
ROBIN: You feel that's
just swirling on us?

23:03.616 --> 23:05.885
GORDON: Yeah.
ROBIN: And you have
all that cologne on.

23:06.952 --> 23:10.623
GORDON: (Bleep).
ROBIN: So, we're
gonna move real slow.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.559
Get down to the shadows?

23:13.559 --> 23:14.760
GORDON: Yes.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.729
ROBIN: Then we're gonna
get across and then, hopefully,

23:16.729 --> 23:18.731
into the dip and then
we're gonna go up the dip.

23:18.731 --> 23:19.899
So when you draw.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.367
GORDON: Yes.

23:21.367 --> 23:23.469
ROBIN: Try and keep your
bow low in one quick motion,

23:23.469 --> 23:26.205
'cause you can slowly
rise up after you draw.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.340
Don't move,
don't move, don't move.

23:28.340 --> 23:31.810
The farthest right black
one is the best one right now.

23:31.810 --> 23:34.880
We need him to get into this
ravine, so we can cut across.

23:36.048 --> 23:37.750
You gotta sneak
up on him, right?

23:37.750 --> 23:39.919
GORDON: So, I'll follow you?

23:40.185 --> 23:44.657
ROBIN: Yeah.
There are two over there.

23:48.994 --> 23:51.497
GORDON: Is it close
enough to shoot?

23:51.497 --> 23:53.866
ROBIN: No. Stay low.

23:58.137 --> 23:59.638
They see me.

23:59.638 --> 24:02.574
GORDON: There's two more.
ROBIN: Yeah.

24:03.008 --> 24:05.844
GORDON: Yeah, just in there.
ROBIN: Yeah, go for it. Shoot.

24:20.025 --> 24:21.927
ROBIN: Try and
keep your bow low.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.636
GORDON: (Bleep).

24:33.005 --> 24:34.740
I might look like Rambo,

24:34.740 --> 24:37.009
but it seems my first
blood is still some way off.

24:37.743 --> 24:39.211
This could be a long night.

24:39.211 --> 24:41.480
ROBIN: They're out
of there before the
arrow even got close.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.749
GORDON: And what is it,
because they hear the bow?

24:43.749 --> 24:45.551
ROBIN: Yeah. Sound's
faster than the arrow.

24:46.352 --> 24:48.821
GORDON: Yeah. Damn,
that's bloody hard.

24:50.356 --> 24:53.792
Because I got in a great
position, 60, 70 yards.

24:55.260 --> 24:58.297
And literally, the minute
I let go, they jumped.

24:59.198 --> 25:01.400
So, I missed my shot.

25:04.903 --> 25:08.607
I might have no idea
about hunting deer, but
fortunately, Robin does.

25:09.274 --> 25:11.343
And he's let me have
one he shot earlier.

25:12.077 --> 25:14.380
It's a win for Hawaii's
delicate ecosystem.

25:14.947 --> 25:17.282
Let's just hope it's
a triumph on my menu.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.588
ROBIN: I cooked some up
here, if you wanna try it.

25:23.389 --> 25:26.058
GORDON: So, this is the
loin here, just seared?

25:26.058 --> 25:28.927
ROBIN: Yeah, this is pretty
much one of the best cuts.

25:28.927 --> 25:30.829
You can almost eat it rare.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.999
GORDON: That's incredible
and so, it will be feeding
off what we're standing on now

25:33.999 --> 25:35.034
grasses and berries.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.503
ROBIN: Grass, guavas, mangoes.

25:37.503 --> 25:39.505
GORDON: I honestly
thought that was gonna
be a lot tougher.

25:39.505 --> 25:41.273
That is delicious. Wow.

25:41.273 --> 25:44.743
I'm just amazed, it's
almost like a super lean beef.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.246
ROBIN: It's 98 and
a half percent lean.

25:47.246 --> 25:48.514
GORDON: Is that what it is?

25:48.514 --> 25:50.182
ROBIN: Yeah.

25:50.182 --> 25:53.719
GORDON: Wow. The good news
for me, is that I've got it for
the cook and that's a dream.

25:54.787 --> 25:57.856
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant,
great job. Thank you.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.391
ROBIN: Yeah, cheers.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.127
And yeah, you owe me for
that arrow that you shot.

26:02.127 --> 26:03.829
We couldn't find it.

26:04.663 --> 26:06.532
It was a clean miss
though, good job.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.467
GORDON: Damn.

26:18.644 --> 26:21.980
I've now just
got 48 hours to
finalize my Hawaiian feast

26:21.980 --> 26:25.484
and if I'm gonna impress
the locals, my cooking
needs to really hit the spot.

26:26.218 --> 26:27.820
Unlike my archery.

26:30.756 --> 26:34.760
Now, I'm on my way to
meet an amazing owner of one
of the most incredible farms,

26:34.760 --> 26:36.962
Ono Farms, on this island.

26:39.031 --> 26:44.136
Ono, that means delicious, and
I'm hoping to find delicious,

26:45.137 --> 26:49.575
incredible fruit that I
could hopefully, utilize and
use across the final cook.

26:50.476 --> 26:53.178
There's 70 tropical
fruits grown on this farm.

26:53.579 --> 26:57.149
I mean, there's bound to be
something there, that I've
never seen or tasted before.

27:01.353 --> 27:04.590
Almost all of Hawaii's
fruits arrived on these
shores from other nations.

27:05.491 --> 27:09.661
Farmer Chuck Boerner's
family have introduced
six varieties themselves.

27:10.762 --> 27:12.397
GORDON: Chuck!
CHUCK: Hey. How you doing?

27:12.397 --> 27:14.066
GORDON: What an amazing farm.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.267
CHUCK: Welcome.
GORDON: Thank you.

27:15.267 --> 27:17.102
CHUCK: Yeah, you
haven't seen anything yet.

27:17.102 --> 27:19.872
We're gonna start right
here with some red bananas,
which I've been saving for you.

27:19.872 --> 27:23.742
GORDON: A red banana?
CHUCK: Yeah. Right here.
Grab one.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.344
GORDON: Any one?

27:25.344 --> 27:26.812
CHUCK: That's a
good one there.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.914
GORDON: Thank you.

27:28.914 --> 27:30.883
Bloody hell, look at
them in the sunlight,
they are really red.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.384
So the skin is red?

27:32.384 --> 27:35.020
CHUCK: But look at that
orange that's on the inside.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.055
GORDON: Absolutely delicious.
They are so sweet.

27:37.389 --> 27:38.790
CHUCK: Aren't they?

27:38.790 --> 27:40.659
I think we ought to take
a couple along with us,
in case we get hungry.

27:41.026 --> 27:42.861
GORDON: Yeah, good idea.
You just throw?

27:43.228 --> 27:44.997
CHUCK: Compost.
GORDON: Are you gonna drive?

27:45.531 --> 27:50.402
CHUCK: Yeah.
GORDON: Come on then. Ooph! Yes.

27:51.203 --> 27:54.139
CHUCK: Okay, we're off.
Huh, hold on.

27:54.540 --> 27:57.843
GORDON: When Chuck says,
hold on, he (bleep) means it.

27:58.043 --> 28:02.014
(Bleep). He floors
it around his farm circuit,
like it's the Ono Raceway.

28:03.315 --> 28:04.716
GORDON: (Bleep).
On every branch,

28:04.716 --> 28:07.953
it seems there's a
new fruit to see, if
they don't blind me first.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.722
(Bleep). (Bleep).

28:11.657 --> 28:14.126
Chuck's first pit stop
is to harvest papaya.

28:14.726 --> 28:15.827
We're going in here?

28:15.827 --> 28:20.232
CHUCK: Yeah. Alright.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.636
GORDON: Chuck, seriously?
(Bleep).

28:24.903 --> 28:27.673
We race on, to
sample some cacao seeds.

28:27.673 --> 28:30.342
CHUCK: Don't chew 'em, just
suck on 'em like a candy.

28:30.642 --> 28:33.545
GORDON: Wow, delicious. Ooph!
CHUCK: Yee‐haw.

28:34.112 --> 28:39.184
GORDON: Wow. Grass
doesn't look as long,
when you're sat inside.

28:40.018 --> 28:41.753
You jump out,
then it's bloody long.

28:41.753 --> 28:43.355
CHUCK: Yeah, just watch
out for the snakes, huh.

28:43.355 --> 28:44.523
GORDON: There's
snakes in here?

28:44.523 --> 28:46.692
CHUCK: No snakes in Hawaii.

28:47.526 --> 28:50.062
I'm just thinking of
fruit you've never
had, called Bilimbi.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.330
GORDON: Bilimbi?
CHUCK: Yeah.

28:51.330 --> 28:52.698
GORDON: No.
CHUCK: It's close by, yeah.

28:52.698 --> 28:56.001
GORDON: Thank God for
that, I'm feeling sick
with your driving.

28:58.637 --> 29:00.339
Oh, my God, it's sour.

29:00.339 --> 29:02.307
CHUCK: Ah‐ha. Yeah,
it's not too sweet.

29:02.307 --> 29:03.375
GORDON: Bloody hell.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.644
(coughs).

29:05.644 --> 29:07.179
What do you use 'em for?

29:07.179 --> 29:08.914
CHUCK: As a lime substitute.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.249
GORDON: So, where
are they from?

29:10.249 --> 29:11.750
CHUCK: Originally, they're
from the Philippines.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.385
So that's all
part of, you know,

29:13.385 --> 29:16.388
how Hawaii is in the middle
of the trade winds out here.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.724
GORDON: Chuck, what
an incredible insight.

29:18.724 --> 29:21.460
Also for me, seeing fruit for
the first time and tasting it,

29:21.460 --> 29:25.163
again, another layer's
been peeled back on this
incredible combination

29:25.163 --> 29:27.366
of cultures and cuisines.

29:27.366 --> 29:28.500
Thank you.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.701
CHUCK: Good.

29:29.701 --> 29:32.504
GORDON: Drive
carefully in that car,
will you, please, yeah?

29:34.039 --> 29:37.976
Chuck has given me
some great ideas, like,
never let Chuck drive.

29:37.976 --> 29:41.546
But he's also
shown me some incredible
ingredients for the feast.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.453
But, there's another
storm breaking.

29:54.826 --> 29:57.095
Look at that. (Bleep).

29:57.696 --> 30:00.532
I hope this Jeep is
equipped with an anchor.

30:03.568 --> 30:05.804
The actual bridge is filling
up with water, as well.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.740
I've never seen a river
running across the bridge and

30:08.740 --> 30:10.776
a massive river
running under the bridge.

30:10.776 --> 30:12.611
Look at that river down there.

30:12.611 --> 30:14.513
Holy mackerel.

30:14.513 --> 30:16.615
I don't wanna hang around
here long, trust me.

30:16.915 --> 30:19.818
Otherwise, I'll
be (bleep) toast.

30:20.719 --> 30:23.188
Bloody hell, and
look what's happening
to the road down here.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.624
It's disintegrating,
literally, into a river.

30:26.625 --> 30:30.696
So right now, it's not
an engine you want,
it's a (bleep) paddle. Wow.

30:38.270 --> 30:42.174
GORDON: The water running
down the road, it's almost
making like a skid path,

30:43.041 --> 30:46.611
because I'm
literally spinning my
wheels, as we go round.

30:48.113 --> 30:49.781
Look at that.

30:50.716 --> 30:52.918
That's what I
call a waterfall.

30:52.918 --> 30:55.253
Listen to that roar.

30:55.587 --> 30:58.924
Oh, boy.
That is ridiculous.

31:03.095 --> 31:07.599
The power coming from that
is absolutely incredible
and the spray is insane.

31:07.599 --> 31:10.869
But that is
breathtaking. My god.

31:11.970 --> 31:15.907
A perfect shower on a
very humid, stormy day.

31:19.411 --> 31:22.414
Every corner,
there's another waterfall.

31:22.414 --> 31:26.418
Any other country, it would be
a national landmark, but here,
it's almost like a bus stop.

31:32.057 --> 31:36.762
The rain is relentless and
right now I could really
do with some comfort food.

31:37.095 --> 31:39.865
So, I'm heading for a
slice of Hawaiian heaven.

31:40.198 --> 31:43.802
Everybody's in love
with banana bread, it's almost
like a staple here in Hawaii,

31:43.802 --> 31:46.438
and I'm a big lover,
I grew up with it.

31:46.438 --> 31:48.740
But they say,
Sandy's is the best.

31:49.307 --> 31:54.312
I can't wait to see
what the fuss is about
Sandy's banana bread. Morning.

31:55.147 --> 31:57.149
SANDY: Aloha.
GORDON: Oh, aloha,
how are you?

31:57.149 --> 31:59.584
SANDY: Very well.
GORDON: Oh, my God, the
smell is extraordinary.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.821
I am dying to try
some banana bread.

32:02.821 --> 32:05.490
SANDY: I can't give it
to you, you're so mean.

32:05.490 --> 32:08.794
GORDON: What?
It's not me.

32:08.794 --> 32:10.629
It's the idiots I
have to work with.

32:10.629 --> 32:14.332
I don't mean to curse,
it's just, unfortunately,
they (bleep) drop out.

32:14.699 --> 32:17.469
So just show me how you make
it then, give me something.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.738
SANDY: Sure, sure, if
you promise not to yell and
swear at me, you can come in.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.106
GORDON: I promise.
SANDY: Come in the back.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.175
GORDON: Come
in the back. Excellent.
Man, you're a toughie.

32:23.175 --> 32:25.544
Oh, dear, my
reputation precedes me.

32:27.145 --> 32:29.614
Time for some damage control,
doing what I do best.

32:30.081 --> 32:32.117
SANDY: So we're gonna put
flour first and then sugar.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.522
GORDON: Salt.
SANDY: Simple, simple.

32:37.989 --> 32:40.959
GORDON: Right.
SANDY: Look how much
bananas go into the mix.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.727
GORDON: All of that in there?
SANDY: All of it.

32:42.727 --> 32:45.630
And then we're gonna
put our hot melted
butter right over it.

32:46.097 --> 32:50.001
GORDON: Wow.
SANDY: So we're gonna
mix it, almost like S's.

32:50.368 --> 32:51.837
Like just S's.

32:51.837 --> 32:54.739
GORDON: S for (bleep).
SANDY: Or super.

32:55.106 --> 32:56.575
GORDON: Damn, I
slipped up here.

32:56.575 --> 33:00.512
But my charm offensive
seems to be working.

33:00.512 --> 33:03.648
Without a measuring cup
in sight, they're judging
the quantities completely

33:03.648 --> 33:05.517
by eye and it looks great.

33:06.518 --> 33:09.321
SANDY: We have four
generations that work in here.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.556
My father is Hawaiian Chinese.

33:11.556 --> 33:14.826
He and seven generations
of his family are
original to this spot.

33:15.060 --> 33:17.028
GORDON: So, the
essence of the trade winds,

33:17.028 --> 33:21.800
it festers this incredible
melting pot of different
origins, different cultures.

33:22.133 --> 33:23.802
SANDY: That's what Hawaii is.

33:23.802 --> 33:26.605
GORDON: Here we go. Oh, man.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.407
The smell coming
from this oven is amazing,

33:29.407 --> 33:31.443
and it's taking me
back to my childhood.

33:31.443 --> 33:33.912
I can't wait to taste it.

33:35.647 --> 33:37.415
SANDY: Mmm, oh you did good.

33:37.415 --> 33:39.851
GORDON: That is
(bleep) delicious.

33:39.851 --> 33:43.021
Sorry.
That is delicious. Sorry.

33:43.288 --> 33:45.590
Banana bread that
makes you curse.

33:45.590 --> 33:47.726
SANDY: Ah‐hmm.
GORDON: It's that good.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.194
SANDY: Yes.
GORDON: Oh, my God.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.462
SANDY: You're a lot
nicer in person.

33:50.462 --> 33:51.897
Thank you very much.

33:51.897 --> 33:53.598
Mission accomplished.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.000
SANDY: So nice to meet you.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.101
GORDON: Thank you so much.

33:56.101 --> 33:57.802
SANDY: Thank you.
GORDON: God bless. Delicious.

33:57.802 --> 33:59.571
Thank you.
Bye bye, thank you.

34:00.105 --> 34:01.406
SANDY: Aloha.

34:01.406 --> 34:03.308
GORDON: (Bleep) weather.

34:08.647 --> 34:12.317
I've got just 24 hours
left, to put my own unique
twist on a Hawaiian feast.

34:12.951 --> 34:16.221
Tasting that banana
bread has got me thinking
about my dessert.

34:17.455 --> 34:19.357
I could use banana, or
maybe that poi cream.

34:20.292 --> 34:23.395
But there's one more local
delicacy to try, breadfruit.

34:23.895 --> 34:27.432
It's another canoe plant,
brought here centuries ago,
by exploring Polynesians.

34:28.166 --> 34:30.468
But, it's a new one on me.

34:31.937 --> 34:34.573
Mike is a guardian
of the largest breadfruit
collection in the world,

34:35.407 --> 34:37.709
with over 150 types
to choose from.

34:39.477 --> 34:40.912
GORDON: What's so special
about the breadfruit, Mike?

34:40.912 --> 34:42.881
MIKE: You can do anything
a potato or rice can do.

34:42.881 --> 34:44.482
GORDON: Right.

34:44.482 --> 34:46.518
MIKE: Complex carbohydrates,
a lot of vitamin A,
vitamin C, a lot of protein.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.920
GORDON: But is it a fruit,
or is it a vegetable?

34:48.920 --> 34:50.155
MIKE: It is a fruit.

34:50.155 --> 34:51.957
GORDON: But it can be
used as a vegetable.

34:51.957 --> 34:53.158
MIKE: You bet, yeah.

34:53.158 --> 34:57.596
GORDON: Wow. That's what the
trade winds legacy blows in,

34:58.029 --> 35:01.199
food with an identity crisis.

35:01.199 --> 35:03.335
GORDON: That's amazing.
MIKE: Break that
open with your hands.

35:04.135 --> 35:05.637
GORDON: Really?
Just tear it open?

35:05.637 --> 35:06.838
MIKE: Yes.

35:06.838 --> 35:10.542
GORDON: Bloody hell. Whoa!
So that's strong inside there.

35:11.276 --> 35:12.644
MIKE: Yeah.
GORDON: Huh?

35:12.644 --> 35:15.213
MIKE: You can tell the
sweetness, try to grab
a little bit like.

35:15.213 --> 35:17.115
GORDON: (Bleep).
MIKE: And then.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.017
GORDON: (Bleep).
I don't know.

35:19.017 --> 35:22.487
Do you know, with the
new baby, diapers everywhere,
I'm just not sure that, argh.

35:25.724 --> 35:29.194
MIKE: So imagine that
in a pot, with some
chocolate, some honey.

35:29.194 --> 35:30.895
GORDON: Have you been smoking?

35:30.895 --> 35:32.664
MIKE: No, no,
that's the real deal.

35:33.331 --> 35:34.933
GORDON: (Bleep).

35:37.202 --> 35:39.904
Yeah, how can we turn this
thing into something delicious?

35:40.372 --> 35:42.874
MIKE: I challenge
you to make something
with this breadfruit,

35:43.308 --> 35:44.876
on your trip here in Hana.

35:44.876 --> 35:48.747
GORDON: So, I think what
I'd like to start off with,
is maybe a firmer one,

35:49.114 --> 35:50.415
a less ripe one.

35:50.415 --> 35:51.783
MIKE: Okay.

35:51.783 --> 35:53.551
GORDON: Because I've
got a couple of ideas,

35:53.551 --> 35:54.786
but I'm just not too sure
about the super sweet one.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.354
MIKE: Sure, yeah, I got
some right over here.

35:56.354 --> 35:57.722
GORDON: Thank you.

35:57.722 --> 35:59.157
MIKE: And we can
pick a couple more.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.059
GORDON: Great. Breadfruit,
let's be honest,

36:01.059 --> 36:03.395
not the most appetizing
looking fruit, stroke vegetable.

36:03.395 --> 36:07.432
It's almost like,
finding the right stage
of that breadfruit

36:07.866 --> 36:12.771
and you turn it into a
vegetable, or into a dessert,
'cause that was super sweet.

36:13.638 --> 36:16.708
Yeah, intriguing, it's
definitely got me thinking.

36:24.482 --> 36:26.384
This is it, the final cook.

36:26.384 --> 36:30.388
And for me, it's time to
give back, understanding what
these trade winds have done

36:30.388 --> 36:33.324
for this incredible island, but
more importantly, give back,

36:33.692 --> 36:35.293
the way the
island's given to me,

36:35.293 --> 36:37.062
because it's been amazing.

36:37.062 --> 36:40.865
Let's hope I do the
forage and the diving,
the hunting justice,

36:42.467 --> 36:46.271
no egg on my face and give
them a meal to remember.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.876
Five days ago, Chef Sheldon
sent me off on my journey.

36:52.243 --> 36:54.646
Now, it's time to show
him what I've learned.

36:58.316 --> 37:00.485
GORDON: Sheldon!
SHELDON: Hey, what's up, Chef?

37:00.785 --> 37:02.220
GORDON: How are you, bud?
Good to see you, my man.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.189
SHELDON: Hey, man.
Oh, you're alive.

37:04.189 --> 37:05.757
GORDON: Alive. Barely.

37:05.757 --> 37:08.593
SHELDON: Still kicking.
GORDON: What a week.
Bloody brilliant.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.162
SHELDON: You got to meet
a bunch of my friends
and the people of Hana.

37:11.162 --> 37:12.630
GORDON: Yes. Now I get it.

37:12.630 --> 37:14.532
The trade winds,
what it means,

37:14.532 --> 37:17.202
but more importantly, this
bounty of produce, incredible.

37:17.202 --> 37:18.503
You started?

37:18.503 --> 37:20.171
SHELDON: I started, which...

37:20.171 --> 37:22.707
I've been slaving
away, I even built a
fire already for you.

37:22.707 --> 37:24.075
GORDON: You're making
me feel bad now, huh?

37:24.075 --> 37:26.311
SHELDON: That's exactly
what I'm trying to do.

37:26.311 --> 37:27.712
GORDON: I'd better get going.

37:27.712 --> 37:29.247
What's that
called, by the way?

37:29.247 --> 37:31.950
SHELDON:
No, so, we're cooking in
the Imu, the fire pit.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.551
GORDON: And is it
gonna be hot enough?

37:33.551 --> 37:35.487
SHELDON: You feel it on
your balls, don't you?

37:35.487 --> 37:37.889
GORDON: I can feel it. (Bleep).
Now I can, yeah. Huh.

37:38.990 --> 37:43.695
Roasted testicles is the least
of my problems, Sheldon's
clearly in his element.

37:44.562 --> 37:46.498
If I don't step up, I'm toast.

37:54.139 --> 37:56.841
GORDON: I'd better
get started, bud.

37:58.443 --> 37:59.644
What's your centerpiece?

37:59.644 --> 38:01.713
SHELDON: I'm gonna
be cooking ulu.

38:01.713 --> 38:02.881
GORDON: Hulu?

38:02.881 --> 38:04.282
SHELDON: Ulu, breadfruit.

38:04.282 --> 38:07.218
I forgot, I gotta keep
on going back to the
layman's term for you.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.554
GORDON: Yeah, I'm sorry, yes.

38:10.622 --> 38:13.324
Sheldon is cool as a
cucumber, but I'm really
feeling the heat now.

38:13.725 --> 38:15.760
And not just from that fire.

38:15.760 --> 38:19.497
SHELDON: What's amazing about
this, I'm actually just gonna
bury it underneath the coals.

38:19.831 --> 38:21.132
GORDON: Oh, really?

38:21.132 --> 38:23.034
SHELDON: Yeah, and
it'll steam in itself,
I will cut the skin off

38:23.034 --> 38:24.669
and it will be
beautiful on the inside.

38:24.669 --> 38:26.104
GORDON: And how will
you finish that off?

38:26.104 --> 38:28.473
SHELDON: First thing I
made you do was forage
for those sea urchins.

38:28.473 --> 38:29.641
GORDON: Yes.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.376
SHELDON: So we're just
gonna top it off with that.

38:31.376 --> 38:33.645
GORDON: Wow, wow,
wow, wow, wow.

38:33.645 --> 38:37.315
While Sheldon cracks on with
his traditional dish, I let
him know how I've decided to

38:37.315 --> 38:39.384
put a British spin on
Hawaii's finest food.

38:40.185 --> 38:41.886
GORDON: I'm gonna use
breadfruit as well.

38:41.886 --> 38:43.488
SHELDON: Okay.

38:43.488 --> 38:46.524
GORDON: Like an incredible
mashed potato for the
cheap cuts from the deer...

38:46.524 --> 38:50.728
The belly, the neck, the
shoulder, and make like a,
don't go crazy now,

38:51.029 --> 38:53.965
look at that face,
almost like a shepherd's pie.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.669
Except we're not using
lamb, we're using deer.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.037
SHELDON: Alright.

38:59.037 --> 39:01.172
You've come to Hana,
to cook a shepherd's pie.

39:01.172 --> 39:04.843
GORDON: No, it's
gonna be a different
take on the shepherd.

39:05.243 --> 39:08.213
Imagine a shepherd's pie
with the most amazing
venison in there.

39:08.546 --> 39:10.849
SHELDON: Alright, I guess
I have to just see it.

39:12.116 --> 39:14.752
GORDON: Sheldon's not hot
on my pie, that's a worry.

39:14.752 --> 39:16.321
GORDON: I'm running
behind, man.

39:16.321 --> 39:18.456
Trust me, the taste
will blow him away.

39:18.456 --> 39:21.526
GORDON: Oh,
(bleep), that's hot.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.027
GORDON: Huh.

39:23.027 --> 39:25.964
Bloody hell, I don't think
that needs turning up.

39:25.964 --> 39:27.732
I'm gonna fry up all
the vegetable first.

39:27.732 --> 39:28.967
SHELDON: Okay.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.902
GORDON: And then
add the venison to it.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.804
That is so hot.

39:32.804 --> 39:36.274
For his main course,
Sheldon's preparing one of the
weirdest fish I've ever seen.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.743
GORDON: What's that
fish you've got there,
what's that called?

39:38.743 --> 39:40.578
SHELDON: This is Opelu Kala.

39:40.812 --> 39:42.580
Kimi got this
beautiful shot on it.

39:42.847 --> 39:44.249
GORDON: And you cook
it whole like that?

39:44.249 --> 39:46.584
SHELDON: So, we're gonna
cook it whole, kind of
in its shell, so to say.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.186
GORDON: Right.

39:48.186 --> 39:49.921
SHELDON: It has this
crazy leather skin.

39:49.921 --> 39:53.992
GORDON: That's incredible.
I've never seen that before.

39:54.325 --> 39:56.261
SHELDON: Feel how rough it is.

39:56.261 --> 39:58.630
GORDON: Yes, it's
almost like a dolphin.

39:58.630 --> 40:01.065
Holy (bleep).
That's hot in there.

40:01.466 --> 40:03.401
(Bleep). (Bleep).

40:03.401 --> 40:07.705
Oh, Sheldon, what
are you doing to me?

40:09.440 --> 40:12.443
So far, I'm the
only one cooking.

40:12.443 --> 40:16.481
All you've done is
stuck it on the fire,
and laughed at me.

40:16.481 --> 40:18.249
SHELDON: I think
I've watched one of
your shows, you said,

40:18.249 --> 40:20.485
"Work smart, not hard."
Chef, so.

40:20.485 --> 40:22.387
GORDON: Yes.

40:24.522 --> 40:26.357
Do you mind
just giving that
venison a little stir, please?

40:26.357 --> 40:28.493
You checking the
seasoning on that?

40:30.762 --> 40:32.230
SHELDON: It's definitely
seasoned, Chef.

40:32.230 --> 40:34.232
GORDON: Yes. A
little bit too much salt?

40:34.232 --> 40:35.934
SHELDON: A touch, a bit.

40:38.503 --> 40:40.638
GORDON: (Bleep).
What was that?

40:40.638 --> 40:45.877
SHELDON: It's some of the
charcoal kind of popping,
telling you to hurry up. No, no.

40:48.379 --> 40:51.082
GORDON: Dodging flying embers,
I crack on with my dessert.

40:51.082 --> 40:54.419
I've got big plans for
that Hawaiian staple, poi.

40:54.686 --> 40:58.389
Okay, now possibly
for one of the boldest
things I've ever attempted.

40:58.923 --> 41:01.559
I'm gonna make a poi custard.

41:02.060 --> 41:06.097
SHELDON: A poi‐nacotta?
GORDON: A poi‐nacotta.
Exactly that.

41:07.398 --> 41:10.034
So, I'm gonna finish it
off with a little bit of
a whipped coconut cream.

41:12.971 --> 41:16.074
SHELDON: I heard Uncle
Wade had some words to say
to you in the taro patch,

41:16.074 --> 41:17.475
you wasn't doing
your part, man.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.676
GORDON: I know,
what's that guy like?

41:18.676 --> 41:21.446
Honestly. My toes
are still caked in mud.

41:21.446 --> 41:23.514
What a character,
though, huh?

41:23.982 --> 41:25.516
Do you think
Wade's gonna like this?

41:25.516 --> 41:27.986
SHELDON: I mean,
there's only way to see.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.454
GORDON: Yes.

41:29.454 --> 41:32.190
SHELDON: I can assure
that it's never been
used in this form before.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.625
GORDON: Really?
Let's hope he likes it.

41:35.727 --> 41:38.663
It's not long until
all the guests arrive and
I'm really up against it.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.698
Are you good?

41:40.698 --> 41:42.967
SHELDON: Yeah, I'm
gonna get some of this
lobster on the grill.

41:42.967 --> 41:44.469
GORDON: Stop that, you're
not cooking are you?

41:44.469 --> 41:45.870
SHELDON: I'm actually
cooking, Chef.

41:45.870 --> 41:47.205
GORDON: Oh, my Lord.

41:47.205 --> 41:50.441
SHELDON: So, ginger,
garlic, black bean,
that's a lot of flavor.

41:50.441 --> 41:54.612
We're gonna tone that down,
with some coconut milk.

41:54.912 --> 41:58.583
GORDON: Beautiful. And
you've grill the lobsters,
the lobsters go inside?

41:58.583 --> 42:01.786
I've still got to
make the topping for my
Hawaiian shepherd's pie.

42:01.786 --> 42:05.323
GORDON: Breadfruit is
cooked, so you can slice
that with the butter.

42:05.990 --> 42:07.692
That's beautiful.

42:07.692 --> 42:12.463
So, that is now
ready for mashing.

42:18.970 --> 42:21.639
At last, I can
start my final dish.

42:21.639 --> 42:23.307
More of Robin's deer.

42:23.307 --> 42:25.943
Seared loin steaks, glazed
with soy sauce and lime.

42:27.412 --> 42:30.515
But, before I know
it, our guests are sat
down and are waiting.

42:33.718 --> 42:36.554
Everyone who's taught me about
Hawaiian cuisine is here,

42:36.788 --> 42:39.190
to taste my
take on their food.

42:39.190 --> 42:40.525
No pressure then.

42:40.525 --> 42:41.926
SHELDON: Chef, are
you ready to serve?

42:41.926 --> 42:43.895
GORDON: Yeah,
ready to go, bud.

42:44.495 --> 42:47.065
Finally,
my feast is finished.

42:47.799 --> 42:50.001
Shepherd's pie, made with
venison and breadfruit mash.

42:52.837 --> 42:55.406
Seared venison loin,
with breadfruit gravy.

42:56.941 --> 42:59.744
And for dessert, poi panna
cotta, with kukui nuts.

43:00.311 --> 43:02.413
(bleep).

43:04.282 --> 43:06.751
But Sheldon's also
pulled out all the stops.

43:07.385 --> 43:12.457
Opelu Kala fish in seaweed and
lemon sauce and spiny lobster,
cooked in spicy coconut,

43:13.091 --> 43:14.959
with breadfruit.

43:14.959 --> 43:17.462
Topped with a fern
and sea urchin garnish.

43:19.130 --> 43:21.199
GORDON: Yeah?
SHELDON: Let's go.

43:23.401 --> 43:25.636
GORDON: Aloha.
GROUP: Aloha!

43:25.636 --> 43:27.472
GORDON: Am I pleased
to see you guys.

43:27.472 --> 43:29.407
Let me help. Oh.

43:30.908 --> 43:32.243
GROUP: Oh!

43:32.243 --> 43:34.445
WOMAN: Opelu Kala.
MAN: Yes.

43:34.445 --> 43:37.748
GORDON: On the back of those
incredible trade winds that
have helped put this unique

43:37.748 --> 43:40.485
cuisine together, I
thought I'd bring a bit
of wind from Scotland.

43:40.952 --> 43:43.287
So this shepherd's
pie, this is my take.

43:43.688 --> 43:46.023
Enjoy, please,
all of you, dig in.

43:46.657 --> 43:48.726
Ah, amazing.

43:48.726 --> 43:50.761
(applause).

43:51.028 --> 43:52.763
GORDON: Enjoy.

43:53.531 --> 43:56.968
What an amazing
insight to unlock all
those incredible secrets,

43:56.968 --> 44:00.271
to understand what true
Hawaiian cuisine is all about.

44:01.205 --> 44:04.308
Phenomenal, because it's
multi‐layered and incredible.

44:04.876 --> 44:09.914
From what the ocean gives
you, to what the mountains
deliver, on a different level.

44:09.914 --> 44:12.583
What do you think's going
through their mind, right now?

44:12.583 --> 44:15.853
SHELDON: I could tell
you what, they've never
had shepherd pie made

44:15.853 --> 44:17.688
with the local venison.

44:17.688 --> 44:19.690
MAN: Chicken and rice.

44:19.690 --> 44:22.527
UNCLE RUSSELL:
You know what this
is a Huli Huli chicken.

44:24.428 --> 44:25.963
(laughter).

44:25.963 --> 44:29.333
GORDON: Fingers crossed,
one little treat, as a
parting thank you, really.

44:29.333 --> 44:33.437
I took that poi, turned
it into a poi‐nacotta.

44:33.437 --> 44:36.941
Now, you're either gonna
love it, or you're gonna
hate it, but, you know,

44:36.941 --> 44:38.576
I've got thick skin,
so I can take it.

44:38.576 --> 44:40.378
So, please, jump in.

44:40.378 --> 44:42.280
I'm gonna wait till the man
takes one spoonful over there.

44:42.280 --> 44:44.882
MAN: Wow.
WOMAN: Gordon, it's awesome.

44:52.056 --> 44:55.359
MAN 2: Delicious.
MAN 3: Number one.
MAN 4: So good.

44:56.627 --> 44:58.696
GORDON: Well, at least
they like my poi‐nacotta.

44:58.696 --> 45:01.232
But now, it's
the moment of truth.

45:01.232 --> 45:03.868
The Hana community leader,
Kaui delivers the verdict.

45:05.102 --> 45:08.039
And Kaui, what's the
general consensus?

45:08.472 --> 45:12.610
KAUI: The venison was really
soft and it's nice taste.

45:12.610 --> 45:17.915
And then, heads up to Sheldon
with, you know, stuff that
we are super familiar with,

45:18.716 --> 45:19.984
the Opelu Kala.

45:19.984 --> 45:22.353
The lobster was
nice and refreshing.

45:22.353 --> 45:26.724
But I think, overall, we
all agree, that shepherd's
pie was pretty amazing.

45:27.458 --> 45:29.026
WOMAN: Comfort food.

45:29.026 --> 45:32.163
KAUI: Flavorful.
A little bit on the salty side.

45:32.163 --> 45:34.165
GORDON: You called it.
Yeah, you're right.

45:36.367 --> 45:40.171
An amazing day and great
feedback from, not just
experts, but proper islanders.

45:40.771 --> 45:43.474
But for me,
a week of a lifetime.

45:44.375 --> 45:45.509
You've been amazing, bud.

45:45.509 --> 45:46.577
SHELDON: Thanks, Chef.

45:46.577 --> 45:49.180
GORDON: Thanks, man.
Right, onto the next adventure.

45:49.180 --> 45:50.881
Good luck, bud.
Good to see you, man.

45:50.881 --> 45:52.316
God bless.
Thank you, bud.

45:52.316 --> 45:53.517
(applause).

45:53.517 --> 45:55.286
SHELDON: Thank you.

45:56.020 --> 45:57.888
GORDON: Who'd believe
this far out in the Pacific,

45:57.888 --> 46:01.759
you'd find an incredible layered
surprising trade winds cuisine.

46:01.759 --> 46:05.997
A fish roasted in its
leathery skin, that's so
moist and luscious inside.

46:05.997 --> 46:10.501
A muddy root vegetable,
that can make a delicious
dessert and torrential rain,

46:10.868 --> 46:12.803
that grows such
mind‐blowing fruit.

46:12.803 --> 46:16.140
My Hana Coast experience
this week, a Chef's dream,

46:16.140 --> 46:18.142
because I've packed
so much into it,

46:18.142 --> 46:21.279
but, truthfully, I've
got so much out of it.

46:21.279 --> 46:22.947
