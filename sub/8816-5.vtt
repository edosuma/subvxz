20:04.974 --> 20:07.140
Oh, yeah.
You don't remember. [ Laughs ]

20:07.190 --> 20:10.543
Isn't it ironic that <i> I</i> forget
that <i> your</i> minds were erased?

20:10.737 --> 20:11.606
[ Laughs ]

20:11.626 --> 20:14.339
Anyway, Jeff's brain
is in an alien body.

20:14.456 --> 20:15.682
It was a whole thing in space.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.042
And nobody but me knows.
And now you.

20:18.119 --> 20:21.254
And the guy who's behind us
who won't stop eavesdropping!

20:21.279 --> 20:23.423
We know you're not asleep, buddy.

20:23.487 --> 20:26.128
Sorry. I'm just naturally curious.
[ Door opens ]

20:26.227 --> 20:28.136
Wow, Jeff.
That was amazing.

20:28.196 --> 20:30.963
Look, Mr. S.!
I fell in the toilet!

20:34.167 --> 20:35.435
Are you sure about this?

20:35.464 --> 20:37.970
That your daughter's married
to an alien with superpowers?

20:37.995 --> 20:40.440
- Yeah, babe.
- Superpowers?!

20:40.913 --> 20:43.876

<i>That's right, Dadders.
Jeff has superpowers.</i>

20:49.350 --> 20:52.061
<i>Tune in next week
and see if we deal with that.</i>

20:52.154 --> 20:54.756
<i>And maybe Reginald will come back.</i>
