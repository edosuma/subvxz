WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:04.170
Amy: Previously on
"Heartland"...

00:04.212 --> 00:05.463
(Loud squirt)
- Oh!

00:05.505 --> 00:06.965
- What was that?

00:07.007 --> 00:09.384
- Clay's ego was burning
out of control!

00:09.426 --> 00:11.553
So I put it out... with ketchup.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.975
(Horse whinnies)
- (Grunts in pain)

00:17.017 --> 00:18.977
- Did you loosen Olivia's
saddle this morning?

00:19.019 --> 00:22.272
Is that what I saw you do?
- (Nervous laugh)

00:22.313 --> 00:25.567
- As of today,
Samantha is on suspension.

00:25.608 --> 00:27.569
In the meantime, I'm gonna
choose a new headliner,

00:27.610 --> 00:29.404
so I want you all to bring
your A-game!

00:31.698 --> 00:39.330
**

00:39.372 --> 00:40.582
(Truck rumbles)

00:42.500 --> 00:44.294
(Hooves thud)

00:44.336 --> 00:50.800
**

00:50.842 --> 00:52.260
(Hooves thud)

00:52.302 --> 00:53.887
- Well, aren't we the keener.

00:53.928 --> 00:55.597
- We both know how important
this practice is.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.807
- Yeah, Natalie's finally gonna
pick me as the headliner.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.934
- I have just as good a chance
as you do.

00:59.976 --> 01:01.353
Sam: The only reason either
of you has a shot

01:01.394 --> 01:03.438
is because you ratted me out.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.647
You turned the coach
against me.

01:04.688 --> 01:07.359
- No one ratted you out.
You did that all on your own.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.902
At least she brought you
back from suspension.

01:08.943 --> 01:11.321
- Yeah, but I'm still
in her doghouse.

01:11.363 --> 01:12.614
- You're right.

01:12.655 --> 01:15.450
I'm still ticked off about
that stunt that you pulled,

01:15.492 --> 01:16.993
but that's not why you won't
be the headliner.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.745
You've missed too many
practices.

01:18.787 --> 01:22.415
So, yeah, I'll be picking
someone else.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.668
Believe me, it wasn't
an easy choice.

01:24.709 --> 01:27.796
Only two of you are even close
to being ready.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.466
Georgie...

01:32.967 --> 01:35.387
you're gonna be my backup...

01:35.428 --> 01:36.888
to Olivia.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.516
- Oh my God! I'm the headliner?!

01:39.557 --> 01:40.892
- If you're ready
to do the work.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.353
- Yes, I'm all in! Thank you.

01:43.395 --> 01:44.979
Natalie: All right,
let's get to it then.

01:45.021 --> 01:46.898
You need to learn
the tail drag.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.734
- Really? But that's,
that's kind of, uh--

01:49.776 --> 01:51.361
- Challenging?

01:51.403 --> 01:53.279
Yeah, that's the point.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.325
- Congrats.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.576
- Thanks.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.578
- Be careful, okay? The tail
drag's really dangerous

02:00.620 --> 02:02.831
for someone at your level.

02:02.872 --> 02:05.000
- My level?
- That's not what I meant.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.835
- You're just jealous
that she picked me.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.679
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

02:23.727 --> 02:27.313
(Customers chatter)
(Music plays on the radio)

02:27.355 --> 02:28.732
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:28.773 --> 02:30.734
- Hi. What- what are these?

02:30.775 --> 02:32.736
- For the Foothills Cowboy
Hall of Fame banquet.

02:32.777 --> 02:34.988
- I, yeah, but I-
I just need one.

02:35.030 --> 02:37.282
- Yeah, but what about
your students?

02:37.323 --> 02:39.743
I mean, it might be an
inspirational evening
for them, you know,

02:39.784 --> 02:41.036
make them aspire
to greater things?

02:41.077 --> 02:42.620
- Yeah, all right, all right.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.748
Can I pay you later for them?
- Yes.

02:44.789 --> 02:46.583
- You could sell steak
to a vegan, you know that?

02:46.624 --> 02:48.001
- I know. (Kiss)

02:48.043 --> 02:50.211
(Door opens)
- Bye.
- Bye.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.922
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Oh, Saturday night.

02:52.964 --> 02:54.591
Clear your schedule.
- Oh family dinner?

02:54.632 --> 02:56.968
Nope. Tim's got a surprise
for you.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.511
- Your aunt's a persuasive lady.

02:58.553 --> 02:59.929
I just bought
the whole team tickets

02:59.971 --> 03:02.474
to the Rodeo Hall of Fame
dinner. That's yours.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.143
- I'd rather you got me some
big-time sponsor like Jade.
- What?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.604
- How'd you do it?
- He didn't.

03:07.645 --> 03:09.647
Chuckwagon Soups approached me.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.024
And by the way,
I won't be needing a ticket.

03:11.066 --> 03:13.318
They're hosting the event
and I'm a special guest.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.904
- I don't get it.
You're not even a pro yet.
Jade: There you go.

03:15.945 --> 03:18.615
Well, they wanted
an up-and-comer to be
the face of the company.

03:18.656 --> 03:19.824
- What about me?

03:19.866 --> 03:21.785
- Guess they wanted
a pretty face.
(Bell rings)

03:21.826 --> 03:23.453
- This is because
you're a girl.

03:23.495 --> 03:24.829
- It could be...

03:24.871 --> 03:26.790
or maybe they just think
I'm better than you.

03:26.831 --> 03:30.001
Either way,
I'm totally stoked.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.754
Tim, get him whatever
he wants. It's on me.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.422
- Come on.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.763
(Hooves thud)

03:43.056 --> 03:45.600
- (Chuckles) Hey, Monty!

03:45.642 --> 03:46.976
(Monty snorts)

03:47.018 --> 03:48.770
(Truck rumbles)

03:52.857 --> 03:53.858
(Happy gasp)

03:53.900 --> 03:55.652
(Truck squeaks to a stop)
(Door opens)

03:55.694 --> 03:57.487
Will Vernon?!

03:57.529 --> 03:58.863
(Laughs)
(Door slams shut)

03:58.905 --> 04:00.073
I thought that was your truck!

04:00.115 --> 04:01.700
Will: Oh my God,
you look great!

04:01.741 --> 04:03.076
- (Laughing)
What a nice surprise!

04:03.118 --> 04:04.994
- Oh, you're as sight
for sore eyes!

04:05.036 --> 04:07.038
- (Laughing)
- Now, what's going on here?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.915
- Oh! Um...
- Oh!

04:08.957 --> 04:11.126
- I'm pregnant.
- Well, congratulations.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.919
- Thank you.
- That is fantastic news.

04:12.961 --> 04:16.589
As a matter of fact,
I happen to have a cigar...

04:16.630 --> 04:19.175
No, wait a minute, the husband's
supposed to give me the cigar.

04:19.216 --> 04:21.094
Where's he at?
- He's in Mongolia.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.971
- No, he's not.
Where is he? Ty!

04:23.013 --> 04:24.723
- Yeah, I'm afraid he is.

04:24.764 --> 04:27.058
It's a long story and I will
fill you in, I promise,

04:27.100 --> 04:29.519
but I want to see grandpa's
face when he sees you.

04:29.561 --> 04:32.105
- Oh, I'm not sure
how many I need,

04:32.147 --> 04:34.858
'cause I'm still thinkin'
about it.

04:34.899 --> 04:37.819
I'll let you know.
(Chuckles) All right.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.239
- Casey again, huh?
(Phone beeps off)
- (Groans)

04:41.281 --> 04:42.866
- Honey, tell her how
many tickets you want

04:42.907 --> 04:44.034
and she'll stop calling.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.910
- Well, I'm not sure
I want any.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.954
- You go every year! Come on.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.622
- No, I'm serious.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.833
I don't like how they're
runnin' things this year.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.627
They shoulda already announced
who the inductee is

04:54.669 --> 04:56.296
instead of waitin'
'til the actual night.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.673
It's a dinner.
It's not a murder mystery.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.258
- Okay.
- They're just tryin'
to sell more tickets.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.260
Amy: Oh, grandpa...
- Yes, what is it?

05:02.302 --> 05:05.221
Will: I'd recognize that
surly voice anywhere.

05:05.263 --> 05:08.475
- Well, look what the wind
blew in here!

05:08.516 --> 05:09.434
(Laughs heartily)

05:09.476 --> 05:10.477
- How ya doin'?

05:10.518 --> 05:11.936
Well, you said you had
an extra room

05:11.978 --> 05:13.605
if I ever wanted to swing by,

05:13.646 --> 05:16.066
so here I am, old buddy,
I'm swingin' by.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.776
- (Laughs excitedly)

05:17.817 --> 05:19.444
(Hooves thud lightly)

05:19.486 --> 05:21.029
- Okay, we'll start real slow.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.823
Now I want you to gently
lay back, flat out,

05:23.865 --> 05:25.867
right over his butt.

05:25.909 --> 05:26.910
Okay, you're too rigid.

05:26.951 --> 05:29.996
Loosen up. Let yourself go.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.206
Let yourself- Okay.
- (Nervous whimper)

05:31.247 --> 05:32.207
Natalie: Really stretch out!

05:32.248 --> 05:33.625
- (Terrified gasps)
No, I'm stuck! Help!

05:33.667 --> 05:35.168
- Okay, okay, calm down.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.628
- I'm gonna fall!

05:36.670 --> 05:37.879
Natalie: Can someone help
Olivia up?

05:37.921 --> 05:39.047
I have to hold the horse.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.468
- (Frightened gasps)
- (Grunts with effort)

05:43.510 --> 05:45.261
Here!

05:45.303 --> 05:47.055
- Ah!
- Uh!
(Hard thud)

05:48.890 --> 05:50.767
Here!
- Don't help me!

05:50.809 --> 05:51.810
- Sorry.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.853
- (Pants)

05:53.895 --> 05:54.938
- You okay?

05:54.979 --> 05:56.231
- She's fine. Right, Olivia?

05:56.272 --> 05:58.066
- Yeah, I'm okay.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.776
- All right, let's try it again.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.027
- Just as an option.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.779
There are a few other tricks
we could do,

06:02.821 --> 06:04.948
like the Stroud layout?
Or the full fender...

06:04.989 --> 06:07.075
- We're going with
the tail drag.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.618
You're not scared of this,
are you?

06:08.660 --> 06:10.370
- No! Uh, just we could try
a few tricks

06:10.412 --> 06:12.122
that I'm more suited to,
'cause I am the head--

06:12.163 --> 06:14.290
- You're the headliner
because I said so,

06:14.332 --> 06:16.626
because I thought
I saw something in you,

06:16.668 --> 06:18.628
but here we are learning the
first stages of a new trick

06:18.670 --> 06:19.713
and you're already quitting?

06:19.754 --> 06:21.089
- I'm not quitting.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.425
- I need a rider with guts.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.094
- Georgie, you're up.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.139
- What?
- What?

06:29.180 --> 06:31.725
- Unless you have a problem
with the tail drag as well?

06:33.101 --> 06:35.020
- Uh, no, no! Not at all.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.271
Natalie: Good.

06:36.312 --> 06:38.106
Then you're my headliner.

06:42.902 --> 06:52.954
**

06:52.954 --> 06:58.251
**

06:58.293 --> 07:02.714
* And at the break of day
you sank into your dream *

07:05.300 --> 07:06.634
* You dreamer *

07:06.676 --> 07:08.094
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

07:09.304 --> 07:11.639
* You dreamer *

07:13.725 --> 07:17.062
* You dreamer *

07:23.943 --> 07:26.863
Georgie: Hey, sorry I'm late.
Want to go sit down?

07:26.905 --> 07:29.032
- No problem.
Is everything okay?

07:29.074 --> 07:30.909
Georgie: Uh, yeah, actually,

07:30.950 --> 07:33.370
I think I just made headliner
for the Extreme Team.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.080
Jade: Seriously?!
- (Happy exhale)

07:35.121 --> 07:37.957
- Way to go, kid!

07:37.999 --> 07:39.751
- Thanks!
- That's amazing!

07:39.793 --> 07:41.169
- What? What's amazing?

07:41.211 --> 07:42.712
- I was picked to be Extreme
Team headliner.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.089
My coach wants me to do
the big finish

07:44.130 --> 07:45.590
at this season's show.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.717
- Fantastic! That's what
you wanted, right?
Jade: That's awesome!

07:47.759 --> 07:49.094
- Yeah, it's just
a little weird.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.345
- What? What's weird?

07:50.387 --> 07:51.888
- Just the way it happened.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.848
She chose Olivia first,
but then got all mad

07:53.890 --> 07:55.433
when was complaining
about this trick,

07:55.475 --> 07:58.061
so then she changed
her mind and chose me,

07:58.103 --> 07:59.104
but I was getting
a lot of dirty looks,

07:59.145 --> 08:01.106
especially from Olivia.

08:01.147 --> 08:04.025
- Well, of course.
They all wanted exactly
what you wanted.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.860
- I just read this
in a science journal.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.321
It said people who gravitate
to sports are actually born

08:08.363 --> 08:09.989
with a gene that makes them
more competitive.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.117
- You know, I bet Clay McMurtry
has that gene!

08:12.158 --> 08:13.702
I wish I coulda seen
his stupid face

08:13.743 --> 08:14.911
when he saw my billboard.

08:14.953 --> 08:16.621
- Billboard? What billboard?

08:16.663 --> 08:24.087
**

08:24.129 --> 08:26.381
- Wow! It's incredible!

08:26.423 --> 08:27.590
No short shorts this time.

08:27.632 --> 08:30.343
- No, and that's gonna happen
with these people.

08:30.385 --> 08:31.803
They are so straight-laced,

08:31.845 --> 08:33.388
but I'm totally okay with that.

08:33.429 --> 08:36.057
This deal means I can finally
afford to get my own place.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.768
- You're moving out
of your mom's? Again?

08:38.809 --> 08:40.186
- I already contacted Caleb.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.063
His trailer's been empty since
Mitch moved off the property.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.441
- Wow, some serious deja vu.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.401
Jade: Which mean I'm having
another house warming party.

08:46.443 --> 08:49.029
So, tomorrow night -
be there, both of you.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.031
- Okay.
- The rodeo school guys
are already coming,

08:51.072 --> 08:52.824
so you should invite
the trick riding girls too.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.075
- Okay, well,

08:54.117 --> 08:55.952
the Extreme Team and I
aren't so close right now,

08:55.994 --> 08:57.245
but I can put it out there.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.456
- Cool.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.166
(Sighs) Well, I better get back.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.339
- Great. Partying with
the rodeo crowd.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.965
- Come on, it'll be fun.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.384
Things are so awkward with
Extreme Team right now.

09:11.426 --> 09:14.346
I think this will help.
We should go.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.056
- Sure, why not.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.558
It went so well last time there
was a party there.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.019
- Just stay away from Olivia
and it'll be okay.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.191
Tim: Well, they said
you were here,

09:26.232 --> 09:27.859
and if I hadn't seen it
with my own eyes...

09:27.901 --> 09:29.027
- Well, I'd ask how
you're doin',

09:29.069 --> 09:30.195
but I can see everything's okay

09:30.236 --> 09:32.072
in your little neck
of the woods.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.115
- Casey McMurtry, Will Vernon.
- Hi.

09:34.157 --> 09:37.160
- Well, now there's a rodeo
name if I ever heard one.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.120
It's very nice to meet ya.
Sorry about your taste in men.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.915
(Everyone laughs)

09:41.956 --> 09:43.458
- Well, you got me there.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.418
Will: Now are you the lady
that has the tickets

09:45.460 --> 09:47.170
for this Hall of Fame deal?

09:47.212 --> 09:50.090
- You're in luck. My company
always gets a batch to sell.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.383
- Oh, great. Can I get two?

09:51.424 --> 09:52.384
One for this fella right here?

09:52.425 --> 09:54.719
- Oh, great. Now I have to go.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.221
Will: (Coughs)

09:56.262 --> 09:57.931
I think you'd find your way
there

09:57.972 --> 09:59.724
whether I helped you
or not there, Jack,

09:59.766 --> 10:01.851
'cause this could be your year.

10:01.893 --> 10:04.396
- You know what?
I don't even care anymore.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.855
Will: Yeah, right.

10:05.897 --> 10:08.274
- Nothin' but one big
cash grab.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.402
- Seems to be workin'
pretty nicely.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.903
Jack's been down
on the Hall of Fame

10:11.945 --> 10:13.488
since I got in before he did.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.198
- Oh, no, that's not true.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.866
- It's the only time he didn't
make it to the banquet.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.410
- That's because
Lou was in labour.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.036
- False labour.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.371
- No, I don't like
the tone of this.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.081
The whole point of this
Hall of Fame deal,

10:23.123 --> 10:24.416
you're supposed to get together
with old friends

10:24.457 --> 10:26.960
and talk about belt buckles
you didn't win,

10:27.002 --> 10:30.296
and rodeo queens he didn't
quite catch and all that.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.924
Remember that time in Airdrie?
There's a good example.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.301
We had that party up there
after we won the team event,

10:35.343 --> 10:36.469
and you were in the corner
in the kitchen--

10:36.511 --> 10:39.014
- Stop. Now's not the time
to be talkin' about that.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.306
- Really?

10:40.348 --> 10:41.850
- Georgie, why don't you tell
them about your news?

10:41.891 --> 10:43.351
- What news?

10:43.393 --> 10:46.187
- Ah, looks like I'm the new
headliner this season.

10:46.229 --> 10:48.815
- Oh, that's exciting!
- Well, good on ya!

10:48.857 --> 10:50.608
- You don't seem excited?

10:50.650 --> 10:53.987
- Well, I am. It's just,
I kind of feel bad for Olivia.

10:54.029 --> 10:56.031
- Really? Why?
- Well, she was picked first,

10:56.072 --> 10:58.033
but then she got all nervous
about the trick.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.076
- What's the trick?

11:00.118 --> 11:01.536
- Actually, it's the tail drag,

11:01.578 --> 11:03.580
so I could use your help
learning it.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.457
- Georgie, the tail drag?
At your level?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.125
No, that's way too dangerous.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.877
- Well, I can't say no unless
I want to end up

11:08.918 --> 11:10.211
on the sidelines like Olivia!

11:10.253 --> 11:12.130
- Well, that's better than
breaking your neck!

11:12.172 --> 11:13.548
- Can we talk about this later?

11:13.590 --> 11:16.009
- Yes, we definitely will.
- Okay.

11:16.051 --> 11:18.303
Actually, I have another favor
to ask.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.263
Jade's having a party
tomorrow night.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.681
Lou says I'm not grounded
anymore,

11:21.723 --> 11:24.351
so I'm okay to go
as long as you pick me up.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.436
- Okay, I can do that.
What's this party for?

11:26.478 --> 11:28.438
- Oh, it's her new sponsor.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.565
She just moved back into
Caleb's trailer so...

11:30.607 --> 11:32.275
- Wait second, back up.

11:32.317 --> 11:33.902
Say that again?

11:34.986 --> 11:36.154
(Door opens)

11:37.864 --> 11:40.533
- Can I get you boys some tea?

11:40.575 --> 11:42.994
- Actually, no, I'm gonna...

11:43.036 --> 11:44.579
I'm gonna hit the hay.
Do you mind?

11:44.621 --> 11:45.955
That's what I'm gonna do.

11:45.997 --> 11:47.999
- Okay.
- Getting old now.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.418
You know Jack.

11:50.460 --> 11:53.338
Last time I saw him he said,
"Oh, I just got married,

11:53.380 --> 11:57.175
to the most beautiful woman
in the world."

11:57.217 --> 11:59.052
Well, he wasn't lying.
- (Chuckles) I'm sure.

11:59.094 --> 12:00.261
- He did. Anyway...

12:01.596 --> 12:04.391
- That's sweet of you.
- Hey...

12:04.432 --> 12:07.018
Apparently you don't feel
too old to flirt.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.187
- You gotta leave me
with somethin'.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.730
Night.
Lisa: Night.

12:13.191 --> 12:15.652
He's charming. (Chuckles)
- Yeah.

12:15.694 --> 12:18.113
- Yeah, it's nice surprise
having him here,

12:18.154 --> 12:20.824
but I gotta tell you
somethin' doesn't feel right.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.325
- What do you mean?

12:22.367 --> 12:24.327
- Oh, he keeps bringing
up the past

12:24.369 --> 12:27.414
and he's tellin' old stories

12:27.455 --> 12:29.332
and talkin' about old friends
and...

12:29.374 --> 12:31.292
- Oh, honey, that's kinda
normal.

12:31.334 --> 12:33.253
That's what we do
as we get older.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.715
- Well, okay, but why would he
have come all this way

12:36.756 --> 12:40.969
just to go to a dinner
he doesn't give a damn about.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.220
- I don't know.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.389
Well, why do you think
he's here then?

12:44.431 --> 12:47.017
- Well, a few years back

12:47.058 --> 12:48.476
another old rodeo friend
of mine -

12:48.518 --> 12:51.396
well you remember him - Eli.
- Oh yeah.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.731
- Well he dropped in out
of the blue

12:52.772 --> 12:55.400
so he could tell me
he was dyin'.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.317
- Oh, well...

12:58.153 --> 13:00.363
You don't think that's
why he's here, do you?

13:00.405 --> 13:01.406
- I don't know.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.241
I mean, I hope not,
but the way he looks,

13:03.283 --> 13:04.909
the way he sounds? I...

13:06.119 --> 13:12.584
**

13:12.625 --> 13:14.169
(Truck rumbles)

13:19.466 --> 13:21.009
- (Annoyed exhale)

13:22.719 --> 13:24.971
(Door opens)

13:25.013 --> 13:26.181
(Door shuts)

13:28.391 --> 13:34.397
**

13:34.439 --> 13:36.232
- (Clear throat)

13:36.274 --> 13:37.692
I hate to interrupt,

13:37.734 --> 13:40.653
but the couple at the table
by the juke box need service.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.030
- Um, I just need to let
you know

13:42.072 --> 13:44.157
that I'm gonna have to cut out
for a while this afternoon.

13:44.199 --> 13:45.742
Chuckwagon's doing
this promotion

13:45.784 --> 13:47.118
and I have to hand out some
free soup and stuff.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.871
- I think you're gettin'
a little too big
for your britches,

13:49.913 --> 13:53.041
and I heard you're throwin'
a big party at Caleb's trailer

13:53.083 --> 13:54.626
that you're renting again.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.337
- So? I'm making enough money.
Don't worry about it.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.631
- Yeah, that's what I thought
too when I got my first sponsor,

13:59.673 --> 14:01.132
and then halfway through
the rodeo season

14:01.174 --> 14:03.134
I was outta cash,

14:03.176 --> 14:05.095
not to mention
the partying lifestyle--

14:05.136 --> 14:07.514
- Tim--
- I'm just sayin', Jade,

14:07.555 --> 14:10.141
I know all about this.
It's not a good path.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.768
- Okay, you need to chill out.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.269
I have worked really hard
for this

14:13.311 --> 14:15.480
and I'm not just gonna
screw it up.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.857
I rented a small trailer and
I'm having a few friends over.

14:17.899 --> 14:20.694
It's not like I'm living this
crazy rock n' roll lifestyle.

14:20.735 --> 14:22.654
God.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.739
- The table!
- Geez!

14:24.781 --> 14:26.324
(Dishes clank)

14:28.326 --> 14:30.286
(Hooves thud)

14:30.328 --> 14:32.080
(Tack jingles)

14:35.291 --> 14:36.751
- (Clicks tongue)

14:36.793 --> 14:38.253
(Hooves thud)

14:40.171 --> 14:41.423
- What are you doin?

14:41.464 --> 14:43.675
- I'm just warming up Checkers.

14:43.717 --> 14:46.177
- You're not thinkin' of doin'
the tail drag I hope?

14:46.219 --> 14:47.303
- I know it's a difficult trick,

14:47.345 --> 14:49.472
but I'm sure I can learn it.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.474
- Georgie, I'm not doubting
your ability,

14:51.516 --> 14:54.102
but it's dangerous
for anyone to try.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.478
I wouldn't do it.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.689
If Lou knew allowed you
she would kill me.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.108
- Well who says you have
to tell her?

15:00.150 --> 15:02.152
- Come here.

15:02.193 --> 15:05.363
Georgie, I wanna show
you something.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.282
- Whoa.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.369
- Okay...

15:11.411 --> 15:13.455
if we keep Checkers
at a standstill,

15:14.873 --> 15:16.750
can you get into position
for the tail drag?

15:16.791 --> 15:17.709
- Yeah, I think so.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.586
- Okay, let's see it.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.383
That's it.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.469
Now lay straight back.

15:27.510 --> 15:30.138
Lay back... fully extended
right back -

15:31.306 --> 15:32.474
More, more, there!

15:33.683 --> 15:35.477
Good. Okay.

15:35.518 --> 15:37.354
Now try to get out of it.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.606
Come on. Use your stomach
muscles!

15:39.647 --> 15:41.483
- (Grunts)
- Come on, use your hands!

15:41.524 --> 15:43.651
Just... (chuckles)

15:43.693 --> 15:44.903
Come on!

15:44.944 --> 15:47.447
- (Grunts)
- See how tough that is?
- (Pants hard)

15:47.489 --> 15:49.407
- Now imagine if you're going
at a full gallop

15:49.449 --> 15:51.368
and your head's down
by your horse's hooves.

15:51.409 --> 15:52.285
- I'll get stronger!

15:52.327 --> 15:54.371
Amy: No, Georgie,
you're not ready.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.498
I can't believe your coach
would even consider this.

15:56.539 --> 15:59.250
Maybe if it was done
in tandem as a hippodrome

15:59.292 --> 16:01.294
with a second rider able
to control the horse.

16:01.336 --> 16:02.545
- That's not risky enough
for Natalie.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.923
If I don't do this she'll just
move on to the next girl.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.257
- Just because she's your coach

16:06.299 --> 16:08.259
doesn't mean she's always right.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.344
I know it might be hard,

16:09.386 --> 16:11.680
but I think you need
to call her out on this.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.523
Will: (Coughs and hacks)

16:24.234 --> 16:25.902
- I'm gonna get his some water.

16:25.944 --> 16:28.530
Will: (Coughs and hacks)

16:28.571 --> 16:29.739
Lisa: My goodness!

16:29.781 --> 16:32.242
- Are you all right?

16:32.283 --> 16:33.993
Will: (Coughs) Oh wow!

16:35.578 --> 16:37.205
(Grimaces)

16:37.247 --> 16:38.248
Lisa: Can I get you
anything else?

16:38.289 --> 16:39.749
Will: Mmm mmm.
A shot of whiskey.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.626
That always helps.
- Aw.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.212
- (Wheezing) I guess it's far
too early for that.

16:44.254 --> 16:45.505
Lisa: Maybe a titch.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.590
Will: I've gotta be smarter
about this.

16:47.632 --> 16:49.509
(Sighs tiredly)

16:49.551 --> 16:50.301
I tell ya...

16:54.055 --> 16:56.641
Even a short stroll can
sometimes really take it out
of me

16:56.683 --> 16:58.935
and I'm stupid.
(Wheezing cough)

16:58.977 --> 17:00.270
That doesn't sound
too healthy, does it?

17:00.311 --> 17:02.605
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

17:02.647 --> 17:03.940
- I think maybe I...
maybe I'll lie down

17:03.982 --> 17:07.027
for a second or two.
Do you mind?

17:07.068 --> 17:10.238
Can you lend me a piece
of your paper?

17:11.698 --> 17:13.575
How about the
Dagwood and Blondie?

17:13.616 --> 17:15.617
- (Chuckles)
- I wouldn't mind catchin' up
with them.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.662
Aw, beautiful.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.663
Thank you, thank you.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.248
- Okay.

17:22.709 --> 17:26.253
Okay, you definitely need to
talk to him about his health.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.091
(Fairgoers chatter)

17:31.426 --> 17:32.927
- Are you a real cowgirl?

17:32.969 --> 17:35.347
- I am. I ride crazy
bucking broncos.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.973
- Wow! Really?

17:37.015 --> 17:38.558
Can I take a picture with you?

17:38.600 --> 17:40.268
- Of course.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.481
(Camera click)

17:44.522 --> 17:46.649
- Thank you!

17:46.691 --> 17:49.652
- Here, guys. We'll get in
and take a picture.
- Yes!

17:49.694 --> 17:52.739
(Laughs) (Camera clicks)
- That's perfect.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.491
Make sure you tag me in that,
okay?

17:54.532 --> 17:55.617
Brianna: Jade?
- Perfect.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.202
- Hi, Brianna Landon.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.371
I'm the rep from Chuckwagon
you'll be dealing with.
- Of course.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.997
- I'm sorry I'm late, but, uh,

18:01.039 --> 18:03.625
that was kind of the reaction
I was hoping for.

18:03.667 --> 18:06.002
You are gonna be a really
positive role model for us.

18:06.044 --> 18:08.296
I'll see you soon, okay?
- Okay.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.174
- Okay, give me your pen.
Clay: Well, look at you.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.385
- What's your name?
- You put the squeaky
in squeaky clean.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.886
You should go
on a national tour,

18:14.928 --> 18:16.012
hit all the Sunday schools
and church picnics.

18:16.054 --> 18:18.014
- Thank you, Jade!
- Jealous much?

18:18.056 --> 18:20.433
- Well, this isn't a good fit
for me anyways.

18:20.475 --> 18:22.852
I'm too much of a wild spirit
for them.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.563
- Oh yeah, I guess that's why
they never considered you
in the first place.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.066
- Thank you!
- Why don't you just
get out of here?

18:28.108 --> 18:29.150
- I'll catch you
at the party tonight.

18:29.192 --> 18:31.277
Maybe we could play
pin the tail on the donkey

18:31.319 --> 18:32.570
or musical chairs.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.656
- Whatever. We'll see who has
the wild spirit tonight.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.991
Hope your mommy gave
you a decent curfew.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.159
(Girls giggle)

18:38.201 --> 18:40.620
- Okay, everyone, obviously
lots of work to do

18:40.662 --> 18:42.706
on everyone's strength
training today.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.582
Let's get started
on the tail drag, Georgie.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.836
- Um, actually I already did
some work on it this morning.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.587
- Excellent! You hear that team?

18:49.629 --> 18:51.673
That's the kind
of commitment I need.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.092
- I don't think you understand.

18:54.134 --> 18:57.012
I couldn't even pull myself
back up into the saddle.

18:57.053 --> 18:58.304
- Well, like I said,

18:58.346 --> 19:01.558
we have a long way to go
if we want to nail this trick.

19:01.599 --> 19:03.768
- I'm sorry,
but Olivia's right.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.437
I think we should
do something else.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.651
- Fine, fine.
That's your choice.

19:11.693 --> 19:13.403
I'm sure I'll find somebody
on this team

19:13.445 --> 19:15.822
who's up for the challenge.

19:15.864 --> 19:18.074
- You can pick whoever
you want but...

19:18.116 --> 19:19.659
you shouldn't make them
do the tail drag.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.661
It's too advanced
for any of us.

19:21.703 --> 19:23.121
- Now you're telling me
how to coach?

19:23.163 --> 19:24.664
- No, no, that's not
what I meant.

19:24.706 --> 19:26.166
- I'm gonna pick
a new headliner,

19:26.207 --> 19:28.960
and she will be doing
the tail drag.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.713
Is that clear?

19:31.755 --> 19:34.174
- Fine. Then I quit.

19:36.134 --> 19:39.554
(Hooves clop)
- (Exasperated sigh)

19:39.596 --> 19:41.222
Olivia: Hold up, Georgie.

19:42.432 --> 19:44.059
I'm with you.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.977
I'm quitting too.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.396
Anybody else with us?

19:48.438 --> 19:50.231
(Hooves clop, horse snorts)

19:51.441 --> 19:59.449
**

19:59.491 --> 20:00.909
- I'm sorry.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.744
(Hooves clop)

20:04.829 --> 20:07.415
(Music blares)
(Partygoers laugh)

20:11.795 --> 20:13.254
- Thanks! Georgie! Come on!

20:14.798 --> 20:17.008
- Oh, I'll be over there
in a second.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.635
So she was really struggling
to get up

20:18.677 --> 20:20.345
and then I run over to help-

20:20.387 --> 20:22.555
- All those girls can talk
about is how you got up
in your coach's grill.

20:22.597 --> 20:25.558
It's like you're some sort
of folk hero or something.

20:25.600 --> 20:26.601
(Horn honks)

20:26.643 --> 20:28.770
Aw, now this party's starting!

20:30.063 --> 20:32.065
Awesome, boys, rig 'em up!

20:32.107 --> 20:34.943
Yes! Come here, let's go.
Follow me.

20:36.528 --> 20:37.696
- Are those what I think
they are?

20:37.737 --> 20:38.947
- Beer funnels?

20:38.988 --> 20:40.907
Yeah, we're gonna do some
friendly beer chuggin'

20:40.949 --> 20:43.159
if that's okay with wholesome
Chuckwagon Soup girl?

20:43.201 --> 20:45.745
- Uh, actually, barley soup
is my favorite kind.

20:45.787 --> 20:47.831
- Oh.
- You and me,
let's go right now.

20:47.872 --> 20:49.833
- All right.

20:49.874 --> 20:52.460
- Can you get this on camera?
(Beer bottles clank)

20:52.502 --> 20:53.461
- Okay.

20:53.503 --> 20:55.839
Guy: Oh, hold steady there.
You ready?

20:55.880 --> 20:57.841
(Beer flows)

20:57.882 --> 20:59.718
Partygoers: (Chant)
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug

20:59.759 --> 21:03.596
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

21:03.638 --> 21:06.057
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

21:06.099 --> 21:08.518
Yeah! Woo! Woo!

21:08.560 --> 21:09.811
- (Burps loudly)

21:09.853 --> 21:11.396
Girl: Yeah, that was good!
(Everyone cheers and laughs)

21:11.438 --> 21:13.648
- I beat you.
- Whatever.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.027
- You okay?

21:17.068 --> 21:18.737
- Charming.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.113
You can stay if you want,

21:20.155 --> 21:22.282
but I think I'm going
to get out of here.
- No. It's okay.

21:22.323 --> 21:24.659
I'm ready to go when you are.
I'll call Amy.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.708
(Pills rattle)

21:31.750 --> 21:33.626
- You uh...

21:33.668 --> 21:37.172
you think you oughta be taking
all those pills with whiskey?

21:37.213 --> 21:39.257
- Ah, at this point, Jack,

21:39.299 --> 21:40.842
I figure what's the difference?

21:40.884 --> 21:42.427
(Chuckles) You know?

21:44.804 --> 21:46.431
What?

21:46.473 --> 21:48.558
So what about Ty now?

21:48.600 --> 21:50.018
- Yeah.
- What's goin' on there?

21:50.060 --> 21:51.061
He's in Mongolia?

21:51.102 --> 21:54.814
- Yeah, he's, he's off
savin' the world.

21:54.856 --> 21:56.691
- That has to be pretty tough
on Amy.

21:56.733 --> 21:59.736
- Ah, no, no, no, she wanted
to support him on this.

21:59.778 --> 22:01.446
They made that decision
together.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.073
- Oh, well that's good.

22:03.114 --> 22:06.034
I mean, far be it
for me to judge.

22:06.076 --> 22:07.702
I'm hardly in a position.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.996
First decade of my marriage

22:10.038 --> 22:12.791
I was out the door
and on the circuit,

22:12.832 --> 22:15.043
but we survived
'cause we were built for it.

22:17.045 --> 22:19.464
Actually, there wasn't much
that me and Carol,

22:19.506 --> 22:21.716
we weren't built for.

22:21.758 --> 22:24.177
Of course until I fell apart.

22:24.219 --> 22:26.137
You know we don't even
speak anymore.

22:26.179 --> 22:28.098
- Yeah, well, that does seem
a shame.

22:28.139 --> 22:30.642
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't...

22:30.684 --> 22:34.104
Didn't mean to get
all heavy here. Not at all.

22:34.145 --> 22:36.564
I guess I've been holed up
on your own a little too much

22:36.606 --> 22:38.274
and I tend to dwell on things.

22:38.316 --> 22:39.526
I think been doing
a lot of that lately.

22:39.567 --> 22:44.030
- Will, there's somethin'
I've been meaning to ask ya...

22:44.072 --> 22:46.491
- Sure, go ahead.
- It's got to do
with those pills

22:46.533 --> 22:48.201
and your hackin' and coughin'.

22:48.243 --> 22:50.662
- All right, well,
just go ahead and ask me.

22:50.704 --> 22:52.664
- Yeah, okay, well...

22:52.706 --> 22:54.833
the thing is I'm wonderin'...

22:56.960 --> 22:57.794
- Just go for it. Ask me.

22:57.836 --> 22:59.045
- Oh just...

23:02.716 --> 23:04.426
Are you dyin'?

23:06.886 --> 23:08.805
- (Laughs hysterically)

23:08.847 --> 23:09.931
Am I dying?

23:11.141 --> 23:12.767
You're beautiful!

23:12.809 --> 23:14.144
- Well, then what's goin' on?

23:14.185 --> 23:16.980
Why did you all of a sudden
show up at my door?

23:17.022 --> 23:19.858
Why are you really here?

23:19.899 --> 23:21.818
- Well, okay.

23:21.860 --> 23:23.987
Look, I'm not supposed
to tell ya, Jack.

23:24.029 --> 23:25.613
I promised.

23:25.655 --> 23:27.407
So don't you let me down.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.701
It's all gotta do with that
Hall of Fame dinner.

23:29.743 --> 23:31.286
Like how they're telling
the inductee who it is

23:31.327 --> 23:32.996
until the actual ceremony.

23:33.038 --> 23:34.205
That's the big surprise
this year.

23:34.247 --> 23:35.290
- Yeah, I know.

23:35.331 --> 23:37.167
Will: Of course they had
to tell the person

23:37.208 --> 23:38.293
who's gonna be doing
the presenting

23:38.335 --> 23:39.753
and guess who that person is?

23:39.794 --> 23:40.962
That's me.

23:42.547 --> 23:43.923
You get it?

23:43.965 --> 23:45.800
Jack, you're in the Hall.

23:48.136 --> 23:51.639
You're finally gettin' into the
Foothills Cowboy Hall of Fame.

23:51.681 --> 23:53.141
It's done.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.811
Congratulations.

24:04.736 --> 24:08.031
Lisa: Oh my goodness!
What is going on in here?

24:08.073 --> 24:10.742
- We're having waffles.
- I can see that!

24:10.784 --> 24:12.702
Is there some special occasion?

24:12.744 --> 24:16.873
- I just wanted to start
this day... have a seat...

24:16.915 --> 24:20.001
on a positive note with my
favorite people in the world.

24:20.043 --> 24:21.878
- (Chuckles)
- (Laughing) Okay!

24:21.920 --> 24:23.672
Um, what's happening?

24:23.713 --> 24:25.048
- Oh, and I should mention

24:26.466 --> 24:30.387
that I bought everybody tickets
to Hall of Fame dinner tonight.

24:30.428 --> 24:31.554
- Wha-are you serious?!

24:31.596 --> 24:33.473
You're the one that was
complaining about what a,

24:33.515 --> 24:37.185
what a "clueless" association,
this stupid ceremony.

24:37.227 --> 24:38.478
You bought us all tickets?

24:38.520 --> 24:41.523
- Well, maybe they're not
as clueless

24:43.400 --> 24:46.111
or as stupid as I thought.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.237
- (Head slap)

24:47.278 --> 24:50.073
- Oh my God.
- They voted you in.

24:50.115 --> 24:51.116
- (Laughing) That's amazing!

24:51.157 --> 24:52.701
Amy and Jack: (Laugh)

24:52.742 --> 24:54.119
Amy: Where is dad?
He should be here for this.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.870
- No, don't tell him.

24:55.912 --> 24:57.372
I want to see the look
on his face

24:57.414 --> 24:59.332
when they call my name.

24:59.374 --> 25:02.210
That's gonna be just about
as sweet as gettin' inducted!

25:10.135 --> 25:11.886
(Knock on door)

25:13.304 --> 25:15.890
(Loud clattering)
(Bottles clank)

25:18.143 --> 25:20.020
- Brianna.
- Hey, hey.
(Door bangs shut)

25:20.061 --> 25:21.521
- Hey.
- Wow!
- Um...

25:23.231 --> 25:26.484
- Looks like you had quite
the party here last night.

25:26.526 --> 25:29.738
- No, yeah, it was just...
just a few friends actually.

25:31.990 --> 25:35.201
So hey, I had a really good
time at our event yesterday.

25:35.243 --> 25:37.162
- I'm really happy with
how it went too,

25:37.203 --> 25:38.997
especially the way you interact
with the public.

25:39.039 --> 25:42.167
It's... it's really terrific.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.753
Anyway. I just came by to say
you did a great job

25:44.794 --> 25:47.756
and drop off your first cheque.

25:50.550 --> 25:52.469
- Thank you very much.
- (Chuckles)

25:52.510 --> 25:54.888
- And don't worry, I...

25:54.929 --> 25:56.264
I really planning on
doing well this year

25:56.306 --> 25:58.767
and helping to boost
your company's profile.

25:58.808 --> 26:01.311
- (Chuckles)
Well, that would be nice,

26:01.353 --> 26:04.314
but it's even more important
that you represent us with...

26:04.356 --> 26:05.982
with class.

26:06.024 --> 26:07.275
Class and integrity.

26:09.402 --> 26:11.363
- It's a promise.

26:11.404 --> 26:13.156
- I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

26:13.198 --> 26:15.325
You quit the Extreme Team?

26:15.367 --> 26:16.785
You were gonna be
the headliner!

26:16.826 --> 26:18.953
Georgie! Sit down.

26:22.123 --> 26:23.917
- Dad, this is one time
when I think quitting

26:23.958 --> 26:25.460
was the right thing to do.

26:25.502 --> 26:28.171
I'm proud of Georgie for
standing up to that coach.

26:28.213 --> 26:30.256
- Well, how bad could she be?

26:30.298 --> 26:32.842
- It... You know, I'm-I'm pretty
much all talked out about this.

26:32.884 --> 26:34.719
I'm gonna go change.

26:37.180 --> 26:39.140
- This isn't a good thing!

26:41.059 --> 26:43.436
I thought being a part
of that team was a positive
thing for her.

26:43.478 --> 26:45.814
- I know, but since the
beginning this coach has been

26:45.855 --> 26:47.148
pitting the girls against
one another

26:47.190 --> 26:49.025
and destroying their confidence.

26:49.067 --> 26:50.902
Now she wants them to do
this crazy trick.

26:50.944 --> 26:52.195
- Did you tell Lou about this?

26:52.237 --> 26:53.905
- She wants me to go talk
to the coach,

26:53.947 --> 26:55.949
which is actually where
I'm headed right now.

26:55.990 --> 26:57.409
- That's a good idea.
I'll come with ya.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.160
- No, it's, it's okay.

26:59.202 --> 27:00.912
I can handle it on my own.

27:00.954 --> 27:02.497
- No.

27:02.539 --> 27:04.457
Amy, I can put my two cents
worth in, coach-to-coach.

27:04.499 --> 27:06.292
Cover me. I'm gonna be gone
for a bit!

27:07.877 --> 27:09.170
- (Sighs)

27:09.212 --> 27:10.964
- Can I help you?

27:11.006 --> 27:13.091
Tim: Uh, yeah, hi,
I'm Tim Fleming.

27:13.133 --> 27:14.384
I'm, I'm Georgie's grandfather.

27:14.426 --> 27:17.095
- I'm Amy, her aunt.

27:17.137 --> 27:18.972
- Nice to have
the family drop by.

27:19.014 --> 27:21.516
- Well, this isn't just
about family.

27:21.558 --> 27:23.101
We, uh, actually happen to know

27:23.143 --> 27:24.436
a little something
about coaching.

27:24.477 --> 27:26.271
- Oh, you do, do you?

27:26.312 --> 27:27.939
- The tail drag,

27:27.981 --> 27:30.191
I believe it's too advanced
for these girls.

27:30.233 --> 27:32.944
- Oh, I see.

27:32.986 --> 27:36.322
That's where Georgie
got all that bluster.

27:36.364 --> 27:39.034
What's wrong with
challenging my team?

27:39.075 --> 27:40.994
What's wrong with separating
them from the pack?

27:41.036 --> 27:45.081
- I understand that you want
the most out of them, but...

27:45.123 --> 27:47.042
- But you're gonna get 'em
killed out there.

27:47.083 --> 27:50.086
You can't put their safety
at risk.

27:50.128 --> 27:52.380
I have a rodeo school.
I know something about this...

27:52.422 --> 27:54.049
- Are you kidding me?!

27:54.090 --> 27:55.300
You're here to talk to me
about safety

27:55.342 --> 27:56.634
and you put your kids
on broncs?!

27:56.676 --> 27:59.012
- I don't put 'em broncs
until they're ready.

27:59.054 --> 28:00.555
I encourage them
to challenge themselves,

28:00.597 --> 28:02.599
not to impress me.
That's not coaching.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.100
That's an ego trip.

28:04.142 --> 28:05.560
- Oh, and old rodeo cowboy
like you

28:05.602 --> 28:08.229
wouldn't know anything
about ego, right?

28:08.271 --> 28:12.400
**

28:12.442 --> 28:13.860
- (Sighs)

28:13.902 --> 28:15.612
Jade: Georgie, where's Tim?

28:15.653 --> 28:17.405
- Oh, I don't know. Out.

28:17.447 --> 28:18.948
- Oh, thank God!

28:18.990 --> 28:20.325
- I wouldn't feel
too comfortable.

28:20.367 --> 28:21.826
He knows you're late and he's
pretty ticked off about it.

28:21.868 --> 28:23.536
- Great.

28:23.578 --> 28:25.413
- It's a good thing he doesn't
follow you on any social media.

28:27.207 --> 28:29.292
Take a look at what Sam posted.

28:29.334 --> 28:34.005
Partygoers: Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

28:34.047 --> 28:36.174
- (Burps loudly)
Oh, that party was epic!

28:36.216 --> 28:38.259
Why did you and Adam
leave so early?

28:38.301 --> 28:41.388
- Okay, I gotta admit, you
throw one hell of a shaker!

28:41.429 --> 28:44.265
- I do, don't I?
- I want a beer chuggin'
re-match though,

28:44.307 --> 28:45.308
maybe at tonight's
Hall of Fame thing.

28:45.350 --> 28:46.643
- No can do.

28:46.685 --> 28:48.853
I'm gonna be in Chuckwagon Soup
goody two-shoes mode.

28:48.895 --> 28:50.438
- Lame.

28:52.107 --> 28:54.359
Georgie, are you goin' tonight?
- Yeah, with Adam.

28:54.401 --> 28:58.196
- Cool. Sam's comin' too.
Maybe we could all hang out?

28:58.238 --> 28:59.197
- So what's the deal
with that now?

28:59.239 --> 29:00.365
Is she like your girlfriend
or something?

29:00.407 --> 29:03.201
- Oh, I don't like to label
these sorts of things,

29:03.243 --> 29:05.954
so don't go gettin'
all jealous on me.

29:05.995 --> 29:07.414
(Chuckles)

29:09.582 --> 29:12.168
- Couldn't you just punch him?

29:12.210 --> 29:13.378
Ugh.

29:13.420 --> 29:15.130
- Aw, I just...

29:16.881 --> 29:18.008
Old days...

29:18.049 --> 29:19.676
(Door opens)

29:19.718 --> 29:21.970
- Hey, Will, how you makin' out?

29:23.346 --> 29:26.391
Do you remember that time
I beat you in um...

29:26.433 --> 29:28.601
- Ponoka...
- Ah!

29:28.643 --> 29:31.104
- Will you ever let me
live that down?

29:31.146 --> 29:32.814
This speech that
you're writin' there,

29:32.856 --> 29:35.233
it's supposed to be about
my career, not yours.

29:35.275 --> 29:36.735
- Well, then it might interest
you to know

29:36.776 --> 29:40.280
that my best memory
from that whole weekend

29:40.321 --> 29:42.657
was not me beatin'
you that bad,

29:42.699 --> 29:45.994
it was actually that party
that we went to after.

29:46.036 --> 29:48.371
Remember that party?
- Oh, here we go.

29:48.413 --> 29:52.334
Will: You know, even after
getting his sorry butt
just kicked

29:52.375 --> 29:55.086
he had the good grace to get
Lyndy to introduce me

29:55.128 --> 29:57.380
to this sweet little thing,
this friend of hers that night.

29:57.422 --> 29:59.049
- Well, that was big of you.

29:59.090 --> 30:01.468
- Well, tell the best part.

30:01.509 --> 30:05.055
- One year later, he was
best man at our wedding.

30:05.096 --> 30:08.350
- Oh! That's sweet.

30:08.391 --> 30:10.560
It sounds like you boys had
quite the time on the circuit.

30:10.602 --> 30:12.687
Will: Yeah.
- Makes me a little jealous
I wasn't there.

30:12.729 --> 30:16.441
- Well, it wasn't all just
a bed of roses, believe me.

30:16.483 --> 30:17.817
- Well, don't downplay it.

30:17.859 --> 30:19.402
You're supposed to be basking
in these glory days, aren't ya?

30:19.444 --> 30:20.987
That's what tonight's all about.

30:22.739 --> 30:24.199
(Door opens)

30:26.368 --> 30:28.328
(Doors slam shut)

30:28.370 --> 30:29.371
(Truck rumbles up)

30:29.412 --> 30:31.289
- Natalie?

30:31.331 --> 30:33.500
(Truck crunches on gravel)

30:35.960 --> 30:37.337
(Door opens)

30:37.379 --> 30:39.089
(Dog barks in the distance)

30:39.130 --> 30:41.049
(Door shuts)

30:41.091 --> 30:42.300
- I've thought about what you

30:42.342 --> 30:44.719
and that blowhard father
of yours had to say.

30:44.761 --> 30:46.137
- What is she talking about?

30:46.179 --> 30:46.763
You and Tim went and talked
to her?!
- We were just trying--

30:46.805 --> 30:49.891
Natalie: Don't be upset
with them.

30:51.184 --> 30:53.520
They actually made me

30:53.561 --> 30:57.357
re-consider my entire
coaching style.

30:57.399 --> 31:00.360
Maybe I have been a bit
too hard on the team,

31:00.402 --> 31:03.738
but it's only because
I see so much potential.

31:03.780 --> 31:07.117
To be honest,
way more than I ever had.

31:07.158 --> 31:09.077
I woulda killed for
half of your talent.

31:10.495 --> 31:12.455
- Really? Well, then...

31:12.497 --> 31:15.083
You've never said
any of that to us, ever.

31:15.125 --> 31:17.460
- I know.

31:17.502 --> 31:19.087
And I've lost the team
because of it.

31:21.423 --> 31:23.633
Can you help me get them back
for one more practice?

31:23.675 --> 31:27.137
I just want have a chance
to say my piece.

31:27.178 --> 31:28.596
They'll listen to you.

31:30.390 --> 31:31.933
(People chatter)

31:33.560 --> 31:35.729
- Jade!

31:35.770 --> 31:37.147
- Well, hey, I was just
on my way home

31:37.188 --> 31:38.690
to get ready for the big event
tonight.

31:38.732 --> 31:40.191
- That's what I came to see
you about.

31:40.233 --> 31:41.192
You can keep your ticket,

31:41.234 --> 31:43.695
but I won't need you
to promote the company.

31:43.737 --> 31:45.488
- But you're the main sponsor.

31:45.530 --> 31:46.865
Shouldn't I be doing something

31:46.906 --> 31:48.658
as the face of Chuckwagon Soup?

31:48.700 --> 31:52.495
- I saw that video,
with you, the beer funnels.

31:52.537 --> 31:54.247
Not cool. Not for our brand.

31:54.289 --> 31:57.334
- Okay, I know that was stupid-
- Yes, it was.

31:57.375 --> 31:59.544
I told you we want someone with
class and integrity.

31:59.586 --> 32:00.920
- I can get that video
taken down.

32:00.962 --> 32:03.381
- It's too late for that.
- I'm really sorry!

32:03.423 --> 32:06.134
- So am I, but what's
done is done and...

32:07.802 --> 32:09.804
(Sighs) we're gonna have
to let you go.

32:09.846 --> 32:13.058
- Seriously? I- You mean...
- Yeah.

32:13.099 --> 32:14.476
You're fired.

32:18.480 --> 32:20.565
(Music plays)
(Guests chatter)

32:20.607 --> 32:30.367
**

32:30.408 --> 32:32.577
- Hey guys.
- Hey.

32:32.619 --> 32:34.329
- Um, Natalie showed up
at Heartland today.

32:34.371 --> 32:35.872
- No way!

32:35.914 --> 32:37.624
- Yeah, she wants us
to bring us back

32:37.665 --> 32:38.833
to talk to the whole team.

32:38.875 --> 32:40.627
I think we should let her.

32:40.669 --> 32:41.836
- What? You're the one
who quit

32:41.878 --> 32:43.254
and we all had your back.

32:43.296 --> 32:45.340
- I know, but do you really
want to miss the whole season

32:45.382 --> 32:47.342
just because of this
one coach?

32:47.384 --> 32:49.928
What if he's different?

32:49.969 --> 32:53.682
Sam: Okay, I'll listen,
but I'm not holding my breath.

32:53.723 --> 32:55.266
- I know what you did!

32:55.308 --> 32:56.851
Getting Sam to post that video
of me online!

32:56.893 --> 32:57.894
- Whoa. What are you
talking about?

32:57.936 --> 32:59.145
I post fun stuff all the time.

32:59.187 --> 33:00.355
- Don't act all innocent.

33:00.397 --> 33:02.857
He wanted me to lose
my sponsorship and it worked!

33:02.899 --> 33:04.651
All because they wanted me
and not you!

33:04.693 --> 33:06.903
Clay: Quiet down.
You are embarrassing yourself.

33:06.945 --> 33:09.364
- You think it's bad losing
to a girl at broncs?

33:09.406 --> 33:10.949
Wait 'til I kick your butt
right here!

33:10.990 --> 33:14.411
Tim: Hey, hey, hey!
What's goin' on here?!

33:14.452 --> 33:17.247
What was that about?
You can't make a scene here.

33:17.288 --> 33:18.456
What would your sponsor think?

33:18.498 --> 33:20.458
- Nothing. They already
dropped me!

33:20.500 --> 33:21.835
- What?

33:21.876 --> 33:23.503
- It's all Clay's fault!
He got his girlfriend to take

33:23.545 --> 33:25.755
this video of me partying
and posted it online.

33:25.797 --> 33:27.882
Partying? Wh-what kind of
partying are we talking about?

33:27.924 --> 33:29.509
- It was no big deal.

33:29.551 --> 33:32.512
- Well, it was obviously a big
enough for Chuckwagon
to drop you

33:32.554 --> 33:35.849
and I got a feeling that
no matter what's behind this,

33:35.890 --> 33:37.267
it's because you made
a bad decision

33:37.308 --> 33:38.601
and that's not Clay's fault.

33:38.643 --> 33:40.437
It's not anybody's fault.
That's on you.

33:40.478 --> 33:43.398
Now sit down.
Don't make a scene.

33:45.150 --> 33:46.401
(Cell phone chimes)

33:48.486 --> 33:50.530
Oh.
(Cell phone chimes)

33:50.572 --> 33:52.574
- Hey!
Ty: Hey, is Jack there?

33:52.615 --> 33:55.243
- Yeah. Um, oh, just a second.

33:58.455 --> 34:00.248
Ty: Hey Jack!

34:00.290 --> 34:03.418
- Ty! How the heck are ya?

34:03.460 --> 34:05.295
- I can't believe
I'm gonna miss this!

34:05.337 --> 34:07.422
- It's oh, it's no big deal.

34:08.715 --> 34:11.342
- Oh, come on, we both know
that's not true.

34:11.384 --> 34:12.719
You've deserved this for so long

34:12.761 --> 34:14.846
and I'm so happy
it's finally happening.

34:14.888 --> 34:17.474
I feel like a...

34:17.514 --> 34:19.893
like a really proud son
or somethin'.

34:19.934 --> 34:22.937
- Thanks, Ty. It...
that means a lot.

34:22.978 --> 34:24.481
- Well, you go enjoy your night.

34:24.522 --> 34:25.982
I'll talk to you soon, okay?

34:26.024 --> 34:28.318
- All right. See ya.

34:28.360 --> 34:29.610
Ty: All right, see ya, Jack.

34:31.446 --> 34:32.530
- Hey.
Ty: Hey.

34:32.572 --> 34:34.282
- Yeah, thanks for doin' that.
Ty: No problem.

34:34.324 --> 34:36.659
- (Kiss) Modern technology.

34:36.701 --> 34:38.828
- Yeah, I want to be beside
Jack to console him

34:38.870 --> 34:40.705
when he doesn't win.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.040
- (Chuckles)
- It's kinda become a tradition.

34:42.081 --> 34:43.166
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen,

34:43.208 --> 34:44.292
please give a warm welcome
to this year's presenter

34:44.333 --> 34:48.463
of the 2016 Foothills Cowboy
Hall of Fame inductee...

34:48.505 --> 34:49.755
Will Vernon!

34:49.797 --> 34:52.300
Guests: (Applaud)
Woo! All right! Yay!

34:52.342 --> 34:53.551
- What the hell is he doin'
up there?

34:53.592 --> 34:54.928
- Just pay attention.

34:54.969 --> 34:57.305
- Thank you, everyone. Hey.

34:58.556 --> 35:00.850
Well, it's been a long time

35:00.892 --> 35:03.770
since I've seen a lot of ya's
in this room here.

35:03.812 --> 35:07.065
It's been nice to be back
with you again and...

35:07.107 --> 35:10.902
you know, this is a great honor
for me to be able to present

35:10.944 --> 35:13.780
this year's inductee
into the Hall of Fame,

35:13.822 --> 35:16.282
except for the fact that
I have to do a little speech.

35:16.324 --> 35:17.701
Guests: (Chuckle)

35:17.742 --> 35:20.453
Will: So what I thought I would
do is start right about now

35:20.495 --> 35:22.539
and list all his
accomplishments,

35:22.580 --> 35:26.001
but then I was afraid that
we'd be here all night.

35:26.042 --> 35:28.712
So suffice it to say that

35:28.753 --> 35:31.172
this year's inductee
was a champion.

35:32.841 --> 35:36.469
He's a champion in team ropin'
and saddle bronc, bulldogging...

35:36.511 --> 35:40.140
You name it, he done it,
and he done it great.

35:40.181 --> 35:43.977
He's a true all-around cowboy
if ever there was one,

35:44.019 --> 35:47.397
but it occurred to me that
all the things that he did
accomplish

35:47.439 --> 35:49.858
inside the ring
and in the arena,

35:49.899 --> 35:53.111
were really nothing
compared to what he uh...

35:53.153 --> 35:56.406
contributed and what
he brought to the fraternity,

35:56.448 --> 35:58.867
and what he's done
for me personally.

35:58.908 --> 36:00.660
I'll never forget, uh...

36:00.702 --> 36:02.787
It's not a one of word
of exaggeration

36:02.829 --> 36:05.999
when I tell you
that he saved my life.

36:06.041 --> 36:08.543
and it was at a point when
I didn't feel like my life

36:08.585 --> 36:09.711
was worth saving.

36:10.962 --> 36:13.631
He's a true friend, and, uh,

36:13.673 --> 36:15.467
in my mind he's the embodiment

36:15.508 --> 36:19.637
of what great about this life
and about the rodeo.

36:19.679 --> 36:21.681
And sometimes, you know,

36:21.723 --> 36:23.933
when you have to wait
for somethin'...

36:23.975 --> 36:27.395
it finally comes
and it's all the sweeter.

36:28.855 --> 36:30.732
So ladies and gentlemen,

36:30.774 --> 36:34.861
put your hands together then
for this year's new member

36:34.903 --> 36:37.739
of the Foothills Cowboy
Hall of Fame -

36:38.782 --> 36:40.617
Mr. Jack Bartlett!

36:40.658 --> 36:43.745
All: (Cheer and applaud)
Yahoy! Yeah! Woo! Woo!

36:44.954 --> 36:46.748
Good job! Woo hoo!

36:46.790 --> 36:47.874
(Sharp punch)

36:49.459 --> 36:50.585
(Applause)

36:50.627 --> 36:51.753
Tim: Hey, Jack!

36:53.505 --> 36:54.798
- (Laughing)

36:54.839 --> 36:56.966
All: (Applause)

36:57.008 --> 36:58.510
Will: That's yours, pardner.

36:58.551 --> 36:59.886
Jack: Look at that...

36:59.928 --> 37:03.098
Oh my Lord.

37:03.139 --> 37:05.642
Guest: Woo!

37:05.684 --> 37:07.686
Jack: Thank you, my friend.
- You betcha.

37:07.727 --> 37:10.021
- Oh boy.

37:10.063 --> 37:12.649
Well...

37:12.691 --> 37:16.277
I am mighty grateful
for this honor, believe me,

37:17.570 --> 37:19.531
and I can't lie.

37:19.572 --> 37:22.492
I have wanted to be a part
of this...

37:22.534 --> 37:25.745
this brotherhood
for a long time now!

37:25.787 --> 37:27.414
Guests: (Chuckle)

37:27.455 --> 37:29.374
- Now here we are and uh...

37:30.834 --> 37:33.920
and I'm...

37:33.962 --> 37:36.631
You know, earlier today my...
my loving wife, Lisa,

37:40.010 --> 37:44.556
she gave me full permission
to bask in my glory days.

37:44.597 --> 37:46.766
(Guest chuckle)

37:46.808 --> 37:51.813
And she assumed that that was
the greatest time of my life,

37:51.855 --> 37:53.815
but that's not actually true.

37:55.775 --> 37:57.485
Yeah, don't get me wrong,

37:57.527 --> 38:00.196
oh, I loved my days
in the rodeo,

38:00.238 --> 38:02.657
especially the memories,

38:02.699 --> 38:04.617
they've lasted a lifetime,

38:04.659 --> 38:07.328
but, you know,
being a Hall of Famer,

38:09.456 --> 38:11.166
it wouldn't mean anything to me

38:11.207 --> 38:13.460
if I didn't have my family

38:15.170 --> 38:18.840
and my special friends
to share it with.

38:21.968 --> 38:24.763
So I want to thank them,

38:24.804 --> 38:27.515
and you all know who you are,

38:27.557 --> 38:29.351
for making these days,

38:31.978 --> 38:35.190
the here and now,

38:35.231 --> 38:37.984
the true glory days
of my life. Thank you.

38:39.652 --> 38:41.529
All: (Applause)
Tim: Oh, yeah, yeah!

38:42.989 --> 38:45.116
Guest: All right!

38:45.158 --> 38:48.161
- Way to go, Jack!
- Way to go!

38:48.203 --> 38:50.872
Guests: (Applause) Bravo!
- (Laughs)

38:55.835 --> 38:57.087
- Hey.

38:57.128 --> 38:58.755
- Hi.

38:58.797 --> 39:00.799
(Door shuts)

39:04.010 --> 39:06.012
- Well, the place looks
a lot better

39:06.054 --> 39:07.806
than last time I was here.

39:07.847 --> 39:09.265
- I just threw a party,

39:09.307 --> 39:12.811
and the way you saw me in that
video, that's not who I am.

39:12.852 --> 39:14.020
I was just blowing off steam.

39:15.814 --> 39:17.732
It was only one night.

39:17.774 --> 39:19.234
- That may be true,

39:19.275 --> 39:20.860
but you're in the public eye
now, Jade.

39:20.902 --> 39:23.780
You don't get to take
a night off...

39:23.822 --> 39:25.490
not if you're gonna be
our spokesperson.

39:27.158 --> 39:29.327
- What? I thought I was fired?

39:30.662 --> 39:33.289
- We've been getting a really
positive response to you,

39:33.331 --> 39:35.125
better than any promotion
we've ever done.

39:35.166 --> 39:39.671
So my bosses were pretty upset
that I let you go.

39:39.713 --> 39:41.172
It's my job on the line now...

39:41.214 --> 39:43.800
if I can't get you back.

39:43.842 --> 39:45.260
- Well, you don't have
to worry about that.

39:45.301 --> 39:47.053
I am so in.

39:47.095 --> 39:50.432
And I promise I won't do
anything to screw it up again.

39:51.599 --> 39:53.560
Deal?
- Deal.

39:59.107 --> 40:02.736
- Okay, first off, thanks for
agreeing to hear me out.

40:02.777 --> 40:05.864
I want to start by saying
I'm sorry.

40:05.905 --> 40:08.867
I guess I can be pretty
demanding and strict,

40:08.908 --> 40:12.662
and I know I have some pretty
crazy expectations,

40:12.704 --> 40:14.706
and I guess I got a little
carried away.

40:14.748 --> 40:16.583
Okay, maybe more than a little.

40:18.251 --> 40:20.378
I have to remind myself that
you're all still learning

40:20.420 --> 40:23.214
just like I'm still learning
how to be a good coach.

40:23.256 --> 40:24.716
So...

40:26.259 --> 40:28.053
what do you say?

40:28.094 --> 40:31.473
Will you give me another shot
at this?

40:32.766 --> 40:35.477
- We all miss Extreme Team
and we want to come back

40:35.518 --> 40:38.730
but the headlining trick--
- No, I know, I know.

40:38.772 --> 40:41.274
You're not comfortable
with the tail drag.

40:41.316 --> 40:43.193
And I did pick you
as the headliner,

40:43.234 --> 40:46.154
so I'm willing to hear
what trick you want to do.

40:49.407 --> 40:51.242
- I still think it should
be the tail drag,

40:51.284 --> 40:52.994
but the safer version.

40:53.036 --> 40:54.954
Two riders in tandem,

40:54.996 --> 40:57.374
one doing the hippodrome
so they can control the horse,

40:57.415 --> 41:00.877
and the other doing
the tail drag part.

41:00.919 --> 41:03.797
I think Sam should be the one
to do the tail drag.

41:03.838 --> 41:05.340
She's still the strongest
rider on our team

41:05.382 --> 41:07.592
and she can pull herself up
no problem.

41:07.634 --> 41:10.345
Olivia and I can take turns
doing thee hippodrome
at each show.

41:10.387 --> 41:13.098
- How's that sound
to the rest of you?

41:13.139 --> 41:15.016
Okay, so let's get to it.

41:16.309 --> 41:18.645
- Hey.

41:18.687 --> 41:20.021
Thank you.

41:22.023 --> 41:24.901
Will: Great party last night,
great friends.

41:24.943 --> 41:28.029
It really makes a man start
to think that maybe,

41:28.071 --> 41:29.989
well, just maybe,

41:30.031 --> 41:32.242
I've shut myself too far off
from the rest of the world.

41:32.283 --> 41:35.745
- Oh, well, it's not too late
to expand your horizons.

41:35.787 --> 41:36.996
You're not dead yet, are ya?
Let me look.

41:37.038 --> 41:38.248
- Despite what some people
think.

41:38.289 --> 41:39.457
- (Chuckles)

41:39.499 --> 41:42.210
- But I was thinkin' maybe...

41:42.252 --> 41:45.964
I'd go outside my comfort zone
as they say,

41:46.006 --> 41:48.174
maybe, uh, I drop in
on the ex.

41:50.051 --> 41:52.971
- Couldn't hurt.
Couldn't hurt at all.

41:53.013 --> 41:53.722
Natalie: (Clicks tongue)

41:55.348 --> 41:59.561
Okay, girls, let's try this
at a slow trot.

42:01.187 --> 42:04.065
- Way to control the horse,
Georgie!

42:05.316 --> 42:07.986
Give it a try when
you're ready, Sam!

42:08.028 --> 42:13.324
**

42:13.366 --> 42:14.325
- (Happy sigh)

42:14.367 --> 42:20.832
**

42:20.874 --> 42:21.958
(Claps)

42:22.000 --> 42:23.793
All: (Clap)

42:23.835 --> 42:25.211
(Happy sigh)

42:29.466 --> 42:31.343
Natalie: Good job, girls.

42:31.384 --> 42:33.928
A bit bumpy, but a really
good start.

42:33.970 --> 42:35.930
Georgie and Sam:
(Laugh excitedly)
Sam: What a rush!

42:40.310 --> 42:42.479
- (Chortles)
- (Laughing) What?

42:42.520 --> 42:45.565
- I'm just imagining her face...
(Chortles)

42:46.858 --> 42:50.362
when she sees me darkening
her door again.

42:50.403 --> 42:52.113
(Door bangs shut)
(Chortles)

42:53.531 --> 42:55.200
What do you think
she's gonna say?

42:55.241 --> 42:57.285
- Ah, who knows.

42:57.327 --> 42:59.496
Probably something like...

42:59.537 --> 43:02.290
"Hello, Will, I'm glad you
finally made it."

43:03.917 --> 43:06.044
- Yeah?

43:07.504 --> 43:09.798
Well, I hope so.

43:09.839 --> 43:12.133
Listen, thanks, Jack.

43:12.175 --> 43:14.636
- Good luck, Will.
(Pats truck)

43:15.845 --> 43:17.180
(Truck starts up)

43:17.222 --> 43:20.016
- I bet there might be a few
four letter words in there.

43:20.058 --> 43:21.434
- (Chuckles)

43:21.476 --> 43:22.811
- See ya.
- Yeah.

43:24.479 --> 43:26.106
* If it weren't
for second chances *

43:26.147 --> 43:28.900
* We'd all be alone *

43:28.942 --> 43:34.656
**
