00:02.502 --> 00:06.336
Captain's Log, Stardate 51367. 2.

00:06.406 --> 00:09.432
We've spent the last three days
on the Mari homeworld.

00:09.542 --> 00:11.476
lt's been a while
since we've had the opportunity

00:11.578 --> 00:12.772
to make new friends

00:12.846 --> 00:15.280
and the crew seems to be making
the most of our stay.

00:18.084 --> 00:19.210
Neelix.

00:19.285 --> 00:21.981
Tom. You've been doing
a little shopping.

00:22.055 --> 00:23.317
lt's a present for B'Elanna.

00:23.390 --> 00:24.584
What is it?

00:24.657 --> 00:27.023
Well, it's sort of personal.

00:27.093 --> 00:28.458
Of course.
Say no more.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.460
l'm on my way

00:29.529 --> 00:32.156
for a little romantic
rendezvous myself.

00:39.239 --> 00:40.729
Neelix...

00:40.807 --> 00:42.968
are you wearing cologne?

00:43.043 --> 00:44.305
Oh...

00:44.377 --> 00:46.038
Talchok musk.

00:46.112 --> 00:48.740
Very enticing scent,
don't you think?

00:48.815 --> 00:51.477
Well, uh, it certainly is...

00:51.551 --> 00:52.483
musky.

00:52.552 --> 00:55.521
l'm going to see Talli again.

00:55.588 --> 00:56.555
Ooh, that was fast work.

00:56.623 --> 00:57.647
Where're you taking her?

00:57.724 --> 01:00.215
Well, actually, l haven't
gotten that far yet.

01:00.293 --> 01:01.920
l'm going to visit her shop,

01:01.995 --> 01:04.589
under the pretext of buying
some produce for the ship,

01:04.664 --> 01:08.430
and then l thought l'd just
sort of segue smoothly

01:08.568 --> 01:10.297
into some dinner and dancing.

01:10.370 --> 01:12.235
Sounds like a good strategy.

01:12.305 --> 01:14.432
You really think so?

01:14.507 --> 01:18.204
l mean...you used to be
quite the ladies' man.

01:18.278 --> 01:19.210
"Used to be"?

01:19.279 --> 01:21.406
Well, l mean,
you're involved now,

01:21.481 --> 01:23.039
so, of course,
you won't be availing yourself

01:23.116 --> 01:24.242
of all the beautiful,
fascinating

01:24.317 --> 01:25.477
and very open- minded Mari women.

01:25.552 --> 01:28.146
Neelix, are you trying
to depress me?

01:28.221 --> 01:29.711
l just...

01:29.789 --> 01:31.916
l haven't been with anyone
since Kes

01:31.991 --> 01:33.925
and l'm feeling a little rusty.

01:33.993 --> 01:36.484
l...l could use some advice.

01:38.031 --> 01:41.489
The best advice l can give you
is to just be yourself.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.863
Right.

01:44.070 --> 01:45.401
Be myself.

01:47.040 --> 01:50.703
Actually...that's the
second- best piece of advice.

01:50.777 --> 01:51.709
What's the first?

01:53.279 --> 01:55.713
Go a little easier on the musk.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:09.395 --> 02:12.228
l'm sorry, Mr. Guill,
but that's my final offer.

02:12.298 --> 02:15.597
Actually, Captain,
l sense you'd be willing

02:15.668 --> 02:18.228
to raise your price
to 300 renns.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.738
Lieutenant Torres needs
this resonator coil to upgrade

02:20.807 --> 02:22.638
Voyager's
communications systems.

02:22.709 --> 02:23.903
Telepaths.

02:23.977 --> 02:24.909
Wait a minute.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.071
l sense you'd be willing to...

02:27.147 --> 02:28.705
settle for 250.

02:30.383 --> 02:31.611
You must have read my mind.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.680
Hey!

02:34.754 --> 02:35.721
l'm sorry.

02:35.788 --> 02:37.483
Are you hurt?

02:38.858 --> 02:40.291
No, no, l'm fine.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.885
l just wish people would
look where they're going.

02:42.962 --> 02:45.453
lt's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

02:45.532 --> 02:46.396
l'll finish up here.

02:46.466 --> 02:47.990
Why don't you go get Neelix?

02:49.903 --> 02:51.871
All right.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.201
This is some
of the loveliest fruit

02:55.275 --> 02:57.004
l've- l've seen in a long time.

02:57.076 --> 02:58.008
Actually, it's been

02:58.077 --> 03:00.341
one of our worst
waterplum seasons in years.

03:00.413 --> 03:02.210
l don't think you'll
find them very sweet.

03:04.651 --> 03:08.052
Mmm. Mmm.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.247
Oh, how wonderfully tart.

03:10.456 --> 03:12.720
Mmm. They'll make
excellent preserves.

03:14.294 --> 03:15.318
Neelix?

03:15.395 --> 03:16.293
Hmm?

03:16.362 --> 03:17.420
Why do you want me

03:17.497 --> 03:18.725
to tug on your whiskers?

03:20.133 --> 03:21.395
Excu- excuse me?

03:21.467 --> 03:23.435
That is what you're thinking,
isn't it--

03:23.503 --> 03:26.438
that you'd like me
to tug on your whiskers?

03:27.974 --> 03:29.805
Well, as a m- matter of fact...

03:29.876 --> 03:31.673
l'd love to.

03:31.744 --> 03:33.507
Do you have time
to wait until l close?

03:35.248 --> 03:37.546
Yes, l think
l can rearrange my schedule.

03:43.122 --> 03:46.319
l guess you could say
l'm becoming obsolete.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.654
ln what sense?

03:47.727 --> 03:51.424
There's virtually no crime
left in our society.

03:51.497 --> 03:53.055
lt took many years,

03:53.132 --> 03:55.157
but just walk
through our streets.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.293
Look around.

03:56.369 --> 03:58.337
Violence no longer exists.

03:58.404 --> 03:59.462
lmpressive.

03:59.539 --> 04:02.201
l'm one of the last officers
still working

04:02.275 --> 04:03.242
for the Constabulary.

04:03.309 --> 04:05.004
And no doubt one of the best.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.705
l'm curious to know more

04:06.779 --> 04:09.213
about your
crime- prevention methods.

04:09.282 --> 04:10.840
Under one condition:

04:10.917 --> 04:13.545
l want to see Voyager--
learn about your methods.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.418
l'm about to perform
my daily security rounds.

04:16.522 --> 04:17.988
Join me.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.718
They are routine
but informative.

04:19.791 --> 04:21.123
Wonderful.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.855
The transport site is this way.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.523
You prefer speaking aloud.

04:25.598 --> 04:26.826
Why is that?

04:26.899 --> 04:29.891
l've grown accustomed
to it over the years.

04:29.969 --> 04:32.733
There are very few
telepaths in Starfleet.

04:32.805 --> 04:35.137
Whatever you prefer.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.766
Neelix...

04:37.844 --> 04:39.334
ready to leave?

04:39.412 --> 04:40.777
Uh, no, uh, you go ahead.

04:40.847 --> 04:43.247
l haven't finished
examining the produce.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.312
Help! Help!

04:46.386 --> 04:48.377
Somebody help me, please!

04:48.454 --> 04:49.887
Stop him!

04:53.293 --> 04:54.658
Help me!

04:57.430 --> 05:00.627
This will teach you to watch
where you're going, you idiot!

05:00.700 --> 05:01.894
You idiot!

05:05.238 --> 05:06.671
Somebody get a doctor!

05:08.007 --> 05:10.407
Why? Why were you
beating that man?

05:13.513 --> 05:14.673
l don't know.

07:13.599 --> 07:16.898
Your..."brig."
lt's a puzzling concept--

07:16.969 --> 07:20.132
shutting someone
away as punishment.

07:20.206 --> 07:23.039
Do you find that it
rehabilitates the prisoner?

07:23.109 --> 07:24.838
The brig is primarily used

07:24.911 --> 07:27.277
as a means of ensuring
the safety of others.

07:27.346 --> 07:28.574
ln what sense?

07:28.648 --> 07:30.411
For example,
if we find ourselves

07:30.483 --> 07:32.417
with a hostile alien
in our custody,

07:32.485 --> 07:34.385
we may need
to confine the individual

07:34.454 --> 07:36.251
until we can locate
the proper authorities.

07:36.322 --> 07:37.414
l see.

07:37.490 --> 07:39.048
And on rare occasions,
we have been forced

07:39.125 --> 07:40.422
to incarcerate a crew member

07:40.526 --> 07:42.426
who has committed
a serious infraction.

07:42.495 --> 07:45.191
l'm surprised
that one of your people

07:45.264 --> 07:47.630
could be capable of doing
something serious enough

07:47.700 --> 07:49.167
to warrant imprisonment.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.668
lt's extremely rare.

07:50.736 --> 07:52.601
ln any case,
the brig has been occupied

07:52.672 --> 07:54.663
for less than one percent
of our journey.

07:54.740 --> 07:59.040
Forgive me, Tuvok,
but it seems...

07:59.111 --> 08:00.635
barbaric.

08:00.713 --> 08:01.771
lf all species were

08:01.848 --> 08:03.748
as enlightened
as yours and mine,

08:03.816 --> 08:06.182
there would be no need
for prisons.

08:06.252 --> 08:07.719
Bridge to Commander Tuvok.

08:07.787 --> 08:08.811
Go ahead, Ensign.

08:08.888 --> 08:11.857
Chief Examiner Nimira's
been recalled to the surface.

08:11.924 --> 08:15.189
There's been some sort of attack
in the marketplace.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.260
l've never seen
so much blood before.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.301
lt's all right.

08:22.368 --> 08:24.495
l heard about someone
getting beaten once

08:24.570 --> 08:25.537
when l was a little girl.

08:25.605 --> 08:26.572
lt's all over now.

08:26.639 --> 08:27.697
l had nightmares for weeks.

08:27.773 --> 08:29.968
lt's okay.
lt's all right.

08:31.410 --> 08:33.037
He was confused.

08:33.111 --> 08:35.273
He said he didn't realize
what he'd done.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.373
l don't understand
why nobody tried to help him.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.418
People were shocked.

08:39.485 --> 08:41.419
Violence is
almost unheard of here.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.580
But when it does occur,

08:43.655 --> 08:45.385
we like
to investigate thoroughly.

08:45.458 --> 08:46.425
Can we help?

08:46.492 --> 08:47.584
Yes. l would

08:47.660 --> 08:50.128
like you, Mr. Neelix
and, uh, Lieutenant Torres

08:50.196 --> 08:52.096
to answer some questions.

08:52.164 --> 08:54.064
Well, you have
our complete cooperation.

08:54.133 --> 08:56.101
Chief Examiner,
are you suspicious

08:56.168 --> 08:58.068
of my colleagues
for some reason?

08:58.137 --> 08:59.263
No, Lieutenant.

08:59.338 --> 09:01.568
l'm simply conducting
an investigation.

09:01.641 --> 09:03.575
Please.
Follow me.

09:17.657 --> 09:19.022
Please have a seat.

09:21.227 --> 09:24.094
l will be monitoring
your thoughts telepathically

09:24.163 --> 09:25.357
during the interview.

09:25.431 --> 09:26.898
This transcription device

09:26.966 --> 09:28.866
will log
your engramatic activity,

09:28.935 --> 09:30.766
so l can review
your statement later.

09:30.836 --> 09:32.360
Let me get this straight.

09:32.505 --> 09:35.736
Not only are you going
to read my mind,

09:35.808 --> 09:37.400
you're going
to record my thoughts.

09:37.476 --> 09:38.807
Yes.

09:38.878 --> 09:42.905
l guess it'd be pretty tough
to keep a secret from you, hmm?

09:53.326 --> 09:55.294
How long had you been
in the marketplace

09:55.361 --> 09:56.623
when the attack occurred?

09:56.696 --> 09:59.358
One hour--
maybe a little longer.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.662
And exactly where
were you standing?

10:01.734 --> 10:04.066
Directly across the square.

10:04.136 --> 10:06.627
From where you were, did you
have a clear view of the attack?

10:06.706 --> 10:09.072
Uh, not at first.

10:09.141 --> 10:10.369
We just heard yelling.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.842
Then, as we got closer,

10:11.911 --> 10:13.469
we saw what was happening.

10:13.546 --> 10:14.638
What exactly brought you

10:14.714 --> 10:16.238
to the market
in the first place?

10:16.315 --> 10:18.044
Captain Janeway and l

10:18.117 --> 10:19.914
had an appointment
with Mr. Guill.

10:19.986 --> 10:21.180
For what purpose?

10:21.253 --> 10:22.982
We'd met him the day before.

10:23.055 --> 10:25.683
He said he could get
a spare resonator coil for us.

10:25.758 --> 10:26.816
l see.

10:26.892 --> 10:28.985
And the two men involved
in the altercation--

10:29.061 --> 10:30.392
had you seen either of them
before?

10:30.463 --> 10:32.988
l'd never seen the victim...

10:33.065 --> 10:35.499
but the attacker...

10:35.568 --> 10:39.026
l think he was the same man
who bumped into B'Elanna.

10:39.105 --> 10:40.595
Bumped into her?

10:40.673 --> 10:42.004
Are you certain?

10:42.074 --> 10:44.008
Yes. They collided accidentally.

10:45.578 --> 10:48.138
When exactly did this happen?

10:48.214 --> 10:50.444
Just as we'd settled
on the price.

10:50.516 --> 10:52.313
He seemed to be
in quite a hurry.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.979
Do you recall what you
were thinking at the time?

10:55.054 --> 10:56.385
What l was thinking?

10:56.455 --> 10:57.547
What does it matter?

10:57.623 --> 10:58.555
Please...

10:58.624 --> 11:00.023
try to remember.

11:00.092 --> 11:01.354
lt may be important.

11:01.427 --> 11:03.327
l didn't think about it much

11:03.396 --> 11:05.261
and no one was hurt,
and l was busy

11:05.331 --> 11:06.958
trying to sort out the coins.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.160
l'm not used
to handling currency.

11:09.235 --> 11:10.566
What was l thinking?

11:12.004 --> 11:14.939
l was thinking how l could bake
a delicious pie

11:15.007 --> 11:16.440
with those waterplums.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.239
Are you sure that's all,
Mr. Neelix?

11:19.311 --> 11:21.245
Yes, of course.

11:21.313 --> 11:24.407
What else would l
be thinking about?

11:24.483 --> 11:27.145
l suppose l was
a little annoyed.

11:27.219 --> 11:29.278
Can you be more specific?

11:29.355 --> 11:31.118
All right.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.751
l guess l was thinking
my foot hurt.

11:34.827 --> 11:36.488
l mean, the idiot stepped
right on it.

11:36.562 --> 11:38.462
Did you call him an idiot?

11:38.531 --> 11:39.498
Of course not.

11:39.565 --> 11:40.896
But you thought it?

11:40.966 --> 11:42.831
l guess so.

11:42.902 --> 11:44.802
Did you also think
about retaliating?

11:44.870 --> 11:46.770
lt was an accident.

11:46.839 --> 11:48.431
But you said he hurt you.

11:48.507 --> 11:50.668
lt didn't occur to you
to hurt him back?

11:50.743 --> 11:51.801
l'd never do that.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.971
But you thought about it.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.483
How am l supposed to remember?

11:58.551 --> 12:01.884
Yes or no,
did you think about hurting him?

12:03.789 --> 12:05.620
Yes or no?

12:08.427 --> 12:10.827
Well, maybe for a split second.

12:11.864 --> 12:13.229
Hey!

12:14.800 --> 12:16.631
l mean, he should
have been watching

12:16.702 --> 12:17.669
where he was going,

12:17.737 --> 12:20.035
but l realized
that he didn't do it on purpose

12:20.106 --> 12:21.038
so l shook it off

12:21.107 --> 12:23.098
and l left.

12:23.175 --> 12:24.267
Why?

12:24.343 --> 12:27.107
What does it matter
what l was thinking?

12:29.315 --> 12:32.341
Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres,
you are under arrest.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.648
On what charge?

12:34.720 --> 12:39.020
Aggravated violent thought
resulting in grave bodily harm.

12:46.065 --> 12:49.262
Are you saying it's a crime
to think about violence?

12:49.335 --> 12:50.302
Yes.

12:50.369 --> 12:51.301
That's ridiculous.

12:51.370 --> 12:53.895
l assure you,
it's quite necessary.

12:53.973 --> 12:57.238
We were once a society
plagued by violence.

12:57.309 --> 12:59.243
When we prohibited
hostile thought,

12:59.311 --> 13:01.745
crime began to drop immediately.

13:01.847 --> 13:05.681
Over the past three generations,
it's all but disappeared.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.049
So you believe
that it's all right

13:07.119 --> 13:10.247
to tell people what they
can and cannot think?

13:10.322 --> 13:11.846
lt's an irrefutable fact

13:11.924 --> 13:13.892
that violent thoughts
from others

13:13.959 --> 13:16.427
can lead to violent actions.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.362
Even if B'Elanna had
a violent thought,

13:19.431 --> 13:22.093
it was Frane
who attacked that man.

13:22.168 --> 13:24.864
Which he only did
because he telepathically

13:24.937 --> 13:26.871
received that thought
from B'Elanna.

13:26.939 --> 13:29.373
His mind was contaminated
by the image,

13:29.441 --> 13:31.636
and it resulted
in a loss of control.

13:31.710 --> 13:33.439
He may have committed
the physical act,

13:33.512 --> 13:36.208
but it was instigated by you.

13:36.282 --> 13:37.214
Where we come from,

13:37.283 --> 13:40.047
people are responsible
for their own actions.

13:40.119 --> 13:42.781
And here,
people are responsible

13:42.855 --> 13:44.823
for their own thoughts.

13:44.890 --> 13:48.223
l'm sure you can understand
how that's necessary for a race

13:48.294 --> 13:49.488
of telepaths.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.052
Yes, l can.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.154
Captain!

13:52.231 --> 13:53.664
l'll accept that your people

13:53.732 --> 13:56.132
can be influenced
by the thoughts of others,

13:56.202 --> 13:59.171
but there were dozens
of people in that square.

13:59.238 --> 14:01.502
How can you be certain
it came from B'Elanna?

14:01.607 --> 14:04.701
The Mari no longer have
violent thoughts.

14:04.743 --> 14:08.338
lt's unlikely any of them
could have been responsible.

14:08.414 --> 14:11.645
Besides, the evidence
against B'Elanna is clear.

14:11.717 --> 14:14.208
She thought about
committing a hostile act.

14:14.286 --> 14:16.151
l'd like to review
that evidence myself,

14:16.222 --> 14:17.314
if you don't mind.

14:17.389 --> 14:19.118
Certainly.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.160
But l'm afraid
you'll be disappointed.

14:23.896 --> 14:25.761
What happens to B'Elanna now?

14:25.831 --> 14:29.130
We have an enlightened
penal system here.

14:29.201 --> 14:33.001
Unlike some, we don't lock
people away to punish them.

14:33.072 --> 14:35.063
You'll be released...

14:35.140 --> 14:37.768
once you've undergone
the engramatic purge.

14:37.843 --> 14:38.775
The what?

14:38.844 --> 14:39.936
lt's a medical

14:40.012 --> 14:42.173
procedure that will
identify and remove

14:42.248 --> 14:44.273
the offending images
from your mind.

14:44.350 --> 14:45.783
Captain!

14:45.851 --> 14:47.079
Once identified,

14:47.152 --> 14:51.111
the images can be removed
from Frane's mind as well.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.817
Memory extraction...

14:52.892 --> 14:55.087
that's a dangerous procedure.

14:55.160 --> 14:58.687
There is a risk
of neurological damage,

14:58.764 --> 15:02.564
but it's necessary
for us to treat Frane.

15:04.136 --> 15:06.161
Will you at least
delay the procedure

15:06.238 --> 15:09.036
until we've had a chance
to review the evidence?

15:09.108 --> 15:10.666
Will you?

15:14.213 --> 15:17.410
lt'll take us about a day
to reconfigure our instruments.

15:17.483 --> 15:20.680
That's all the time
l can give you.

15:22.388 --> 15:24.219
That's all the time
l'll need.

15:49.848 --> 15:50.906
Captain,

15:50.983 --> 15:52.245
we've got to get
B'Elanna out of there.

15:52.318 --> 15:53.376
You know the rules, Tom.

15:53.452 --> 15:54.578
We can't pick and choose

15:54.653 --> 15:56.814
which laws we'll respect
and which we won't.

15:56.889 --> 15:59.483
Nobody can be expected
to control their thoughts.

15:59.558 --> 16:00.684
Tell that to the Mari.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.489
Are you just going to let them
put her through this process?

16:03.529 --> 16:05.224
l'm doing everything
l can to stop it.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.356
Neelix is going to file
a diplomatic protest

16:07.466 --> 16:10.264
and Tuvok and l will be going
over the witness statements.

16:10.336 --> 16:13.328
Maybe we can poke a few holes
in the Chief Examiner's case.

16:13.405 --> 16:14.497
And if you can't?

16:15.574 --> 16:17.769
Then let's hope
the Doctor can figure out

16:17.843 --> 16:19.708
how to reverse
an engramatic purge.

16:22.014 --> 16:23.538
All away personnel
have been notified

16:23.615 --> 16:25.378
to return to the ship
as soon as possible.

16:25.451 --> 16:26.975
So much for R&R.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.888
Chakotay, we've got to talk.

16:30.956 --> 16:31.980
Have a seat.

16:32.057 --> 16:33.991
Here?

16:34.059 --> 16:36.357
l'm sure the Captain
wouldn't object.

16:36.428 --> 16:38.896
What's on your mind?

16:38.964 --> 16:41.262
While Tuvok and the Captain
are reviewing the evidence,

16:41.333 --> 16:43.358
B'Elanna's sitting
in a Mari jail cell

16:43.435 --> 16:45.027
waiting
for some sort of lobotomy.

16:45.104 --> 16:46.093
We can't let that happen.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.229
What did you have in mind?

16:47.306 --> 16:48.432
Break her out.

16:48.507 --> 16:51.374
And risk an all- out
confrontation with the Mari?

16:51.443 --> 16:52.876
They're a bunch of pacifists.

16:52.945 --> 16:54.139
They're no match for us.

16:54.213 --> 16:56.010
You're probably right,

16:56.081 --> 16:58.413
but before we start resorting
to extreme measures,

16:58.484 --> 17:00.418
don't you think we should give
the Captain a chance

17:00.486 --> 17:01.680
to find a legal solution?

17:01.754 --> 17:04.086
By the time that happens,
it may be too late.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.851
l'll tell you what.

17:05.924 --> 17:08.188
Why don't you come up
with a rescue plan--

17:08.260 --> 17:10.854
one that minimizes
the possibility of violence--

17:10.929 --> 17:11.953
and l'll review it.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.261
You're just trying
to keep me busy, aren't you?

17:14.333 --> 17:16.358
Can you blame me?

17:16.468 --> 17:18.402
l'm serious about this,
Chakotay.

17:18.470 --> 17:20.267
So am l.
lf your plan is sound,

17:20.339 --> 17:23.273
and the Captain doesn't have
any luck on her end,

17:23.342 --> 17:24.969
l'll recommend we attempt
the rescue.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.636
Thanks.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.406
l'll get right on it.

17:28.513 --> 17:29.674
Tom...

17:29.748 --> 17:31.909
l may have let you sit
in the Captain's chair,

17:31.984 --> 17:34.248
but remember,
she's still the boss.

17:38.357 --> 17:41.417
Then you don't accept
the Chief Examiner's conclusion?

17:41.527 --> 17:42.585
l'm not dismissing it,

17:42.661 --> 17:45.323
but l'm not going
to accept it blindly either.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.331
l've spent a great deal of time

17:47.399 --> 17:49.663
with Nimira
over the past few days.

17:49.735 --> 17:52.704
She clearly is
a very skilled investigator.

17:52.771 --> 17:54.068
l'm sure she is.

17:54.139 --> 17:55.436
And this isn't the first time

17:55.507 --> 17:57.304
Lieutenant Torres'
violent proclivities

17:57.376 --> 17:58.866
have created problems.

17:58.944 --> 18:00.411
No argument there.

18:00.512 --> 18:02.605
But l have a hard time buying

18:02.648 --> 18:06.209
that one fleeting thought
makes her responsible

18:06.285 --> 18:07.582
for a vicious attack.

18:07.653 --> 18:10.486
From what l've learned,
crime here is a result

18:10.556 --> 18:12.456
of exposure
to violent thought,

18:12.524 --> 18:14.355
much as it was on Vulcan

18:14.426 --> 18:17.088
before my people learned
to control their emotions.

18:17.162 --> 18:19.858
ln my opinion,
the Mari should be

18:19.932 --> 18:21.365
applauded for their efforts.

18:21.433 --> 18:24.129
Oh, l'm sure their intentions
are admirable, but, uh...

18:24.203 --> 18:27.104
l'm not about to let them
scramble B'Elanna's brain

18:27.172 --> 18:28.264
without a fight.

18:28.340 --> 18:30.604
But we must prepare ourselves
for the probability

18:30.676 --> 18:32.371
that she will turn out
to be culpable

18:32.444 --> 18:33.741
for the crime.

18:33.812 --> 18:35.541
Maybe so...

18:35.614 --> 18:37.912
and then again...

18:37.983 --> 18:39.746
maybe not.

18:39.818 --> 18:41.547
Take a look at this.

18:43.188 --> 18:45.554
l don't mean to accuse
your friend Nimira

18:45.624 --> 18:47.615
of being less than thorough,
Tuvok,

18:47.693 --> 18:50.992
but don't you find that
just the least bit curious?

18:54.099 --> 18:56.033
"New evidence"?

18:56.101 --> 18:59.036
lt concerns the attacker,
Mr. Frane.

18:59.104 --> 19:01.095
According to your own
security records,

19:01.206 --> 19:03.299
he was arrested on
four previous occasions

19:03.342 --> 19:04.707
for harboring violent thoughts.

19:04.776 --> 19:06.209
You classified him

19:06.278 --> 19:09.577
as an"habitual perpetrator
of hostile images."

19:09.648 --> 19:10.774
True.

19:10.849 --> 19:14.148
But those thoughts
were purged each time.

19:14.219 --> 19:17.620
He spent years
in neurogenic restructuring.

19:17.689 --> 19:20.681
The records also
say he was cured.

19:20.759 --> 19:24.627
Still, it is possible
that Frane had a relapse...

19:24.696 --> 19:26.027
that he alone is responsible

19:26.098 --> 19:27.793
for his actions
at the marketplace.

19:27.866 --> 19:31.233
Possible, but unlikely.

19:31.303 --> 19:34.602
Our engramatic scans of Frane

19:34.673 --> 19:37.870
show that Lieutenant
Torres's thought

19:37.943 --> 19:40.969
was prevalent in his mind
during the attack.

19:41.046 --> 19:43.537
And you are certain

19:43.615 --> 19:45.606
no other violent
thoughts were present?

19:45.684 --> 19:47.811
l'm beginning to feel

19:47.886 --> 19:49.751
like l'm the one
being investigated.

19:49.821 --> 19:52.688
l am simply exploring
all logical options.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.555
As a fellow
law enforcement officer,

19:54.626 --> 19:55.991
you should understand that.

19:56.061 --> 19:58.427
l do.

19:58.497 --> 20:02.433
And l'm willing to share
my findings with you.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.195
But if you're trying to prove

20:04.269 --> 20:09.002
your crewmate's innocence,
you're too late.

20:09.074 --> 20:12.009
The case is closed.

20:16.114 --> 20:18.344
Do you think
that this is easy for me?

20:18.417 --> 20:22.478
l don't want to harm B'Elanna,
but l don't have a choice.

20:22.588 --> 20:24.886
That thought has
to be contained.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.482
Otherwise, we risk
further violence, maybe even

20:27.559 --> 20:29.288
a citywide panic.

20:29.361 --> 20:31.921
You told me your people
spent centuries

20:31.997 --> 20:35.160
learning how to control
their violent impulses.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.203
l know we haven't achieved
your level of discipline,

20:38.270 --> 20:40.135
but we're trying.

20:41.506 --> 20:43.474
l thought you'd understand.

20:45.477 --> 20:47.672
l am not judging your culture.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.476
ln fact, l admire it.

20:50.549 --> 20:53.916
l have enjoyed
your company in particular,

20:53.986 --> 20:58.548
but l cannot abandon
my responsibility to B'Elanna.

20:58.657 --> 21:02.058
l must continue
my own investigation.

21:02.127 --> 21:04.322
Go right ahead.

21:04.396 --> 21:07.422
But l intend to proceed
with the engramatic purge.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.235
Telepathy...

21:13.305 --> 21:15.239
l don't like it.
Never have.

21:15.307 --> 21:17.275
lt's bad for negotiations,

21:17.342 --> 21:19.003
it's bad for relationships

21:19.077 --> 21:21.875
and it's certainly
been bad for B'Elanna.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.006
The fault was her own.

21:24.082 --> 21:25.811
What are you talking about?

21:25.884 --> 21:28.182
She was careless
with her thoughts.

21:28.253 --> 21:29.982
The result was violence.

21:30.055 --> 21:33.024
B'Elanna's not used
to being around telepaths.

21:33.091 --> 21:34.718
That doesn't make her guilty.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.954
Then her crime was ignorance--

21:37.029 --> 21:39.429
a common affliction
among your crew.

21:40.465 --> 21:41.955
What's that supposed to mean?

21:42.034 --> 21:43.865
You make contact
with alien species

21:43.935 --> 21:46.597
without sufficient understanding
of their nature.

21:46.672 --> 21:50.631
As a result, Voyager's directive
to"seek out new civilizations"

21:50.709 --> 21:52.301
often ends in conflict.

21:54.579 --> 21:59.243
What you call"ignorance,"
we call"exploration..."

21:59.318 --> 22:02.412
and sometimes it means
taking a few risks.

22:02.521 --> 22:05.422
But it's certainly better
than assimilating

22:05.490 --> 22:06.514
everything in your path.

22:06.591 --> 22:08.855
Your goal is to share knowledge.

22:08.927 --> 22:11.828
Assimilation is the perfect
means of attaining that goal.

22:13.231 --> 22:15.358
"Perfect."

22:15.434 --> 22:17.026
Good morning, Miss Tembit.

22:17.102 --> 22:18.433
Your usual selection?

22:18.537 --> 22:19.469
Yes, please.

22:19.538 --> 22:20.470
Okay.

22:20.539 --> 22:22.666
Oh, l'm- l'm so sorry.

22:22.741 --> 22:24.470
Hey!

22:24.543 --> 22:26.511
ldiot!
Watch what you're doing!

22:49.301 --> 22:50.529
She's dead.

22:56.274 --> 22:58.640
l can't believe she's dead.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.940
l know this is difficult
for you, Mr. Neelix,

23:01.046 --> 23:03.640
but try to recount for me
everything that happened.

23:03.682 --> 23:07.209
Seven and l were packing
to return to the ship.

23:07.285 --> 23:08.513
We heard a scream.

23:08.587 --> 23:09.781
l went running...

23:09.855 --> 23:13.018
The old lady was just
standing over Talli's body,

23:13.091 --> 23:15.616
holding the bloody knife
in her hand.

23:15.694 --> 23:18.629
l didn't even get a chance
to say good- bye.

23:18.697 --> 23:20.722
Did the old woman say anything?

23:20.799 --> 23:22.323
Not that l remember.

23:22.401 --> 23:25.131
She was as shocked and confused
as anyone else.

23:26.838 --> 23:29.204
Do you think this
is somehow connected

23:29.274 --> 23:30.673
with the other attack?

23:30.742 --> 23:32.141
l'm not certain,

23:32.210 --> 23:34.474
but it strikes me
as more than coincidence

23:34.546 --> 23:37.481
that two violent altercations
have occurred within two days,

23:37.582 --> 23:38.913
in a city which purports

23:38.984 --> 23:41.077
to have eliminated
virtually all crime.

23:41.153 --> 23:42.882
Bridge to Commander Tuvok.

23:42.954 --> 23:44.114
Tuvok here.

23:44.189 --> 23:46.487
Chief Examiner Nimira
wants to see you.

23:46.558 --> 23:49.288
She's requesting permission
to transport aboard.

23:49.361 --> 23:50.885
Permission granted.

23:50.962 --> 23:52.691
Have her escorted
to the briefing room.

23:52.764 --> 23:53.958
Tuvok out.

23:54.032 --> 23:56.000
We will continue later.

23:56.067 --> 23:57.898
Commander.

23:59.571 --> 24:01.368
She was a wonderful young woman.

24:01.473 --> 24:05.341
Whoever's responsible
for her death-- find them,

24:05.377 --> 24:07.174
and see that they're
brought to justice.

24:07.245 --> 24:09.509
l will do my best, Mr. Neelix.

24:32.270 --> 24:34.033
Thanks for seeing me.

24:34.105 --> 24:35.663
l heard what happened.

24:35.740 --> 24:38.971
Do you have any idea what
caused this latest attack?

24:39.044 --> 24:41.842
l just finished interviewing
the old woman.

24:41.913 --> 24:43.244
And?

24:43.315 --> 24:44.714
She attacked the victim

24:44.783 --> 24:46.876
in response to the
same violent thought

24:46.952 --> 24:48.783
that motivated
the previous beating.

24:48.854 --> 24:49.946
B'Elanna's thought?

24:51.122 --> 24:53.420
But both she and Frane
are in custody.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.960
How could the thought
have been passed to anyone else?

24:56.027 --> 24:57.790
l don't know.

24:57.863 --> 25:00.093
That's why l'm here.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.963
l need your help.

25:04.870 --> 25:06.030
Then you shall have it.

25:06.104 --> 25:08.299
Thank you.

25:08.373 --> 25:11.774
l don't know why that thought
is still contaminating people,

25:11.843 --> 25:13.811
but l have got
to put a stop to it.

25:13.879 --> 25:15.506
l've never dealt
with a murder before,

25:15.580 --> 25:19.141
but you've had experience
with homicide investigations?

25:19.217 --> 25:20.650
l have.

25:20.719 --> 25:22.209
l thought l would start
by tracing

25:22.287 --> 25:24.517
the old woman's whereabouts
for the past few days

25:24.589 --> 25:26.614
to see where she might have
encountered the thought.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.249
A wise choice.

25:28.326 --> 25:29.987
ln the meantime, l would like

25:30.061 --> 25:31.961
to interview B'Elanna
more extensively.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.395
Perhaps a fresh perspective

25:33.465 --> 25:35.660
might uncover facts
you hadn't considered.

25:35.734 --> 25:37.599
l'll arrange it immediately.

25:44.776 --> 25:47.244
l'm not sure l like
the idea of a mind- meld

25:47.312 --> 25:49.109
any better
than an engramatic purge.

25:49.180 --> 25:51.375
lt will be a limited meld.

25:51.449 --> 25:53.610
l will focus exclusively
on your memories

25:53.685 --> 25:55.744
of the events
surrounding the crime.

25:55.820 --> 25:58.152
lt poses no danger.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.781
Are you ready?

26:06.865 --> 26:09.265
Your mind to my mind.

26:09.334 --> 26:12.792
Your thoughts to my thoughts.

26:12.871 --> 26:16.534
Recall your encounter
with Mr. Frane.

26:16.608 --> 26:18.166
He bumped into you.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.870
What happened next?

26:19.945 --> 26:21.936
l guess that's
when l had the thought

26:22.013 --> 26:23.071
about hitting him.

26:23.148 --> 26:24.137
And after that?

26:24.215 --> 26:26.911
Guill came over
and asked if l was hurt.

26:26.985 --> 26:29.613
And what were you thinking
at that moment?

26:29.688 --> 26:30.848
Why?

26:30.922 --> 26:33.891
l'm sensing something
more to the encounter

26:33.959 --> 26:35.426
than what you've told me.

26:35.493 --> 26:37.324
Try to recall.

26:37.395 --> 26:38.953
lt may be important.

26:39.030 --> 26:42.090
Well, he was just holding me
by the shoulders.

26:42.167 --> 26:44.362
You said he'd been
reading your mind

26:44.436 --> 26:46.404
during the negotiation.

26:46.471 --> 26:48.063
Was he still doing it?

26:48.139 --> 26:49.163
l don't know.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.731
You experienced
negative feelings about him.

26:53.545 --> 26:55.069
He gave me the creeps.

26:55.146 --> 26:56.704
ln what sense?

26:57.616 --> 27:00.244
He...wanted something.

27:00.318 --> 27:02.752
Something terrible.

27:02.821 --> 27:04.448
What the hell?

27:06.324 --> 27:09.054
Why didn't l
remember that before?

27:09.127 --> 27:10.185
You may be recalling

27:10.261 --> 27:12.354
an unconscious thought
you had at the time

27:12.430 --> 27:14.057
or an intuition.

27:14.132 --> 27:17.260
Perhaps l should ask Mr. Guill.

27:26.244 --> 27:27.836
Mr. Guill.

27:31.082 --> 27:32.276
l'm Commander Tuvok,

27:32.350 --> 27:33.783
Voyager's Chief of Security.

27:33.852 --> 27:36.753
My children get upset
when l'm late for supper.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.049
lf you're here to do business,

27:38.123 --> 27:39.920
we could make an appointment
for tomorrow.

27:39.991 --> 27:42.425
l'm here to talk to you
about the attack.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.018
Why me?

27:44.095 --> 27:45.426
My crewmate, Lieutenant Torres

27:45.497 --> 27:47.624
has been charged with the crime.

27:47.699 --> 27:49.326
l believe
you're acquainted with her.

27:49.401 --> 27:51.426
Lieutenant Torres, yes.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.993
She was arrested?

27:53.071 --> 27:55.972
The Chief Examiner believes
it was her violent thought,

27:56.041 --> 27:57.474
which prompted the beating.

27:57.542 --> 27:59.942
She seemed like such
a pleasant young woman.

28:02.847 --> 28:04.678
Apparently, she was
almost knocked over

28:04.749 --> 28:06.148
while doing business with you.

28:06.217 --> 28:07.809
Do you recall that?

28:07.886 --> 28:09.080
Yes.

28:09.154 --> 28:11.122
A man accidentally
ran into her and...

28:14.626 --> 28:17.720
You're not like the others
from your ship, are you?

28:17.796 --> 28:19.661
You're a telepath.

28:19.731 --> 28:21.221
That is correct.

28:22.467 --> 28:24.230
Why are you so curious
about what happened?

28:24.302 --> 28:27.271
l am conducting my own
investigation of the crime.

28:27.338 --> 28:29.272
l see.

28:29.340 --> 28:33.174
For a moment, l thought you had
another reason for asking.

28:33.244 --> 28:38.045
You...struggle
with violent thoughts as well.

28:38.116 --> 28:40.812
Terrible images,
but they're hidden

28:40.885 --> 28:42.284
deep within your mind.

28:42.353 --> 28:44.981
l am in control of those images.

28:45.056 --> 28:48.548
All members of the Vulcan race
learn to inhibit emotions.

28:48.626 --> 28:51.026
lf my unconscious thoughts
are disturbing you,

28:51.096 --> 28:53.394
l will attempt to suppress
them further.

28:53.465 --> 28:54.432
No, please.

28:54.499 --> 28:57.161
Don't trouble yourself.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.294
l can't see them clearly enough
to be affected.

29:00.672 --> 29:04.870
l sense that you are fascinated
with my unconscious thoughts.

29:04.943 --> 29:07.878
That you would like to see
more of them if you could.

29:07.946 --> 29:09.607
No.

29:09.681 --> 29:13.708
l was just thinking
maybe l could help you.

29:13.785 --> 29:14.979
Help me?

29:15.053 --> 29:17.886
ln learning how to deal
with these...

29:17.956 --> 29:19.150
dark impulses.

29:19.224 --> 29:21.021
No, thank you.

29:21.092 --> 29:23.356
l have sufficient means
of controlling them.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.157
l'm sure you do.

29:32.303 --> 29:34.362
Any other questions?

29:34.439 --> 29:36.532
No.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.007
Then, if you'll excuse me,

29:38.076 --> 29:40.044
l really can't be late
for the table.

30:08.339 --> 30:09.636
Do you have the money?

30:09.707 --> 30:10.901
3, 000 renns.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.376
l have something
exciting for you tonight.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.537
Why are you following us?

30:39.604 --> 30:42.402
l was thinking
about what you said...

30:42.473 --> 30:45.237
your interest
in my unconscious thoughts.

30:45.310 --> 30:47.972
Perhaps we could
help each other.

30:48.046 --> 30:50.207
How would we do that?

30:50.281 --> 30:53.682
By telepathically exchanging
violent images.

30:53.751 --> 30:55.548
That is
what you want, isn't it?

30:55.653 --> 30:58.747
To see what's
buried in my unconscious?

30:58.823 --> 31:00.290
Who is he?

31:00.391 --> 31:01.824
Quiet.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.953
Why should l trust you?

31:04.028 --> 31:08.590
Because you know
we are very much alike.

31:10.835 --> 31:13.303
Perhaps l was mistaken.

31:13.371 --> 31:14.531
Wait.

31:19.577 --> 31:22.341
Maybe we can be of use
to each other.

31:22.413 --> 31:24.210
But you'll have
to get rid of this.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.749
Come back later, Malin.

31:34.826 --> 31:37.192
lf l'm right,
l'll have thoughts to share

31:37.262 --> 31:39.389
that are darker
than anything you can imagine.

32:07.892 --> 32:09.689
Well?

32:09.761 --> 32:11.194
Fascinating.

32:12.163 --> 32:14.427
Now...

32:14.532 --> 32:15.726
show me.

32:16.801 --> 32:18.894
l'll need a few moments
to recover.

32:20.838 --> 32:22.897
l'm surprised
you're so easily tired.

32:22.974 --> 32:25.442
Your telepathic abilities
are strong.

32:25.543 --> 32:28.512
lt is not often that l
exercise those skills.

32:29.847 --> 32:32.714
There must be violent thoughts
to be had from your shipmates,

32:32.784 --> 32:35.981
whether they want
to share them or not.

32:36.054 --> 32:40.013
After all, they
couldn't stop a telepath

32:40.091 --> 32:42.252
from probing their minds,
could they?

32:42.327 --> 32:44.852
ls that how you acquire
your merchandise?

32:45.863 --> 32:47.922
Sometimes l buy.

32:47.999 --> 32:49.626
Sometimes l find
a person like you

32:49.701 --> 32:50.861
who's willing to share,

32:50.935 --> 32:52.732
and, yes, when the opportunity
presents itself,

32:52.804 --> 32:54.704
l take what l need.

32:54.772 --> 32:57.468
Which is what you did
to Lieutenant Torres.

32:57.542 --> 33:01.376
Frane took her thought,
not me.

33:03.081 --> 33:04.548
So, you know Mr. Frane.

33:04.615 --> 33:06.674
Only casually.

33:06.751 --> 33:08.412
Well enough
to be in business with him?

33:08.486 --> 33:09.680
Why do you ask?

33:09.754 --> 33:12.245
l am interested in the thought
he acquired from B'Elanna--

33:12.323 --> 33:15.588
her violent tendencies
have always fascinated me,

33:15.660 --> 33:18.993
yet l've never succeeded
in probing her mind.

33:19.063 --> 33:22.863
lf you could help me purchase
that thought...

33:22.934 --> 33:24.333
lt's impossible.

33:24.402 --> 33:26.996
Frane's already had it purged.

33:27.071 --> 33:29.437
Odd.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.600
l was certain you possessed it.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.473
Me?

33:37.115 --> 33:39.845
Didn't you extract the thought
from B'Elanna as well,

33:39.917 --> 33:41.976
just after she collided
with Frane?

33:42.053 --> 33:43.645
What?

33:43.721 --> 33:46.622
l reevaluated B'Elanna's
memories of the incident.

33:46.691 --> 33:49.159
She remembers that
you probed her mind.

33:49.227 --> 33:51.024
She remembers incorrectly.

33:51.095 --> 33:52.426
Perhaps...

33:52.497 --> 33:54.863
or perhaps you did
extract that image,

33:54.932 --> 33:55.956
which would explain

33:56.034 --> 33:58.594
why that same thought
is still in circulation--

33:58.669 --> 34:00.136
why it prompted
a murder this morning.

34:00.238 --> 34:01.205
Enough.

34:03.741 --> 34:06.209
lt's time you gave me
what you promised.

34:06.277 --> 34:09.007
The only person you'll be
sharing thoughts with tonight

34:09.080 --> 34:11.047
is the Chief Examiner.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.378
Where are you going?

34:18.456 --> 34:19.684
Stand aside.

34:19.757 --> 34:22.658
Tuvok's taking me into custody.

34:22.726 --> 34:23.659
No!

34:42.647 --> 34:44.012
Still no sign of him.

34:44.081 --> 34:46.107
Try a multiphasic bio- scan.

34:46.184 --> 34:48.344
We're being hailed, Captain.

34:48.418 --> 34:49.476
lt's Nimira.

34:49.554 --> 34:51.283
On screen.

34:51.355 --> 34:54.620
Chief Examiner, have you
had any luck locating Tuvok?

34:54.692 --> 34:56.683
l'm afraid not.

34:56.761 --> 34:58.729
l'd like to send a search party.

34:58.796 --> 34:59.990
l can't allow that.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.087
Why not?

35:01.132 --> 35:03.999
We can't risk further violations
of our laws.

35:04.068 --> 35:05.228
That's ridiculous.

35:05.303 --> 35:06.270
Tom...

35:06.337 --> 35:07.304
l really don't think

35:07.371 --> 35:08.838
we pose a serious threat.

35:08.906 --> 35:11.272
There's nothing more to discuss.

35:11.342 --> 35:15.176
Lieutenant Torres will be purged
then returned to you.

35:15.246 --> 35:18.374
Captain, you can't
let them do that.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.917
The decision's been made.
l'm sorry.

35:31.395 --> 35:32.794
Let go of me!

35:32.864 --> 35:34.422
B'Elanna, please...

35:34.532 --> 35:35.931
try to relax.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.433
Oh, you have got to be kidding!

35:37.502 --> 35:38.560
Sedate her.

35:38.636 --> 35:39.603
No. Wait!

35:57.255 --> 35:58.415
Proceed.

36:10.101 --> 36:12.331
You won't escape punishment
for your crimes.

36:12.403 --> 36:13.734
Quiet!

36:15.973 --> 36:18.908
You are responsible for a death.

36:18.976 --> 36:20.409
l never meant that to happen.

36:20.511 --> 36:21.876
The old woman begged me
for that thought.

36:21.946 --> 36:22.878
l had to help her.

36:22.947 --> 36:23.879
Here.

36:27.285 --> 36:29.253
You are justifying murder.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.878
Enough.

36:30.955 --> 36:32.047
Malin, hold him still.

36:35.927 --> 36:37.622
Now...

36:37.695 --> 36:39.663
show me.

36:50.708 --> 36:52.642
You're holding back.

36:52.710 --> 36:56.305
l haven't seen
the best of it yet, have l?

36:56.380 --> 36:57.711
No.

36:57.782 --> 36:59.113
Then show me.

37:01.018 --> 37:05.250
lf l show you,
will you let me go?

37:06.290 --> 37:07.882
Yes.

37:07.959 --> 37:09.449
Come closer.

37:12.396 --> 37:13.795
Don't be alarmed.

37:13.864 --> 37:18.528
This will allow you to see
the deepest recesses of my mind.

37:18.603 --> 37:22.039
My mind...to your mind

37:22.106 --> 37:23.664
and my thoughts...

37:23.741 --> 37:25.800
to your thoughts.

37:30.214 --> 37:31.875
Yes.

37:31.949 --> 37:33.109
Good.

37:38.356 --> 37:40.950
This is the side of you
l wanted to know.

37:55.206 --> 37:59.233
What's...happening?

37:59.310 --> 38:01.972
We are locked
in a Vulcan mind- meld.

38:02.079 --> 38:04.639
You don't understand
the truth of violence.

38:06.484 --> 38:08.111
lts darkness...

38:08.185 --> 38:09.812
its power!

38:26.771 --> 38:29.035
Please...stop.

38:33.577 --> 38:35.738
lncrease the electrochemical
displacement,

38:35.813 --> 38:38.782
but be very careful
with the synaptic potentials.

38:38.849 --> 38:41.409
One miscalculation
and we could permanently damage

38:41.485 --> 38:43.385
her cerebral cortex.

38:43.454 --> 38:45.547
Communications Center
to Chief Examiner Nimira.

38:45.623 --> 38:47.352
Nimira.

38:47.425 --> 38:49.825
Captain Janeway insists
on speaking with you.

38:49.894 --> 38:52.158
She says it's extremely urgent.

38:52.229 --> 38:55.130
Relay her signal.

38:55.199 --> 38:56.291
What is it, Captain?

38:56.367 --> 38:58.062
lt's imperative
that you discontinue

38:58.135 --> 39:01.332
Lieutenant Torres' engramatic
extraction immediately.

39:01.439 --> 39:03.498
Commander Tuvok
has found new evidence,

39:03.541 --> 39:06.101
which proves her innocence.

39:28.032 --> 39:30.227
l hope this interruption
is justified.

39:30.301 --> 39:33.134
Suspending an engramatic purge
once it's begun

39:33.204 --> 39:35.195
is highly irregular.

39:35.272 --> 39:36.364
Then let's not waste
any more time.

39:36.507 --> 39:37.531
Commander.

39:40.044 --> 39:41.033
l have discovered

39:41.112 --> 39:42.807
that Guill and Frane
are responsible

39:42.880 --> 39:44.404
for the beating
in the marketplace,

39:44.515 --> 39:46.915
and consequently,
for Talli's murder.

39:46.984 --> 39:49.077
Guill, the merchant?

39:49.153 --> 39:50.677
That is correct.

39:50.755 --> 39:52.655
What possible involvement
could he have?

39:52.723 --> 39:55.590
lt was Frane who acted
on the violent thought.

39:55.659 --> 39:57.286
That is not in dispute.

39:57.361 --> 39:59.852
However,
Lieutenant Torres' thought

39:59.930 --> 40:02.262
was not transferred
accidentally.

40:02.333 --> 40:03.425
l don't understand.

40:03.534 --> 40:06.833
When Guill first met
Lieutenant Torres,

40:06.904 --> 40:10.271
he sensed strong, violent
tendencies within her,

40:10.341 --> 40:14.607
a potential for mental imagery
which interested him.

40:14.678 --> 40:16.873
ln order to exploit
that potential,

40:16.947 --> 40:19.973
he conspired with Frane
to provoke B'Elanna.

40:20.050 --> 40:22.746
They wanted to trigger
a violent thought,

40:22.820 --> 40:25.653
so they could telepathically
draw it from her mind.

40:25.723 --> 40:28.590
l can't believe that.

40:28.659 --> 40:30.889
lt is precisely what happened.

40:30.961 --> 40:33.327
Unfortunately,
they underestimated

40:33.397 --> 40:34.887
the intensity of the thought.

40:34.965 --> 40:36.728
lt was more powerful

40:36.801 --> 40:39.065
than anything either of them
had ever experienced.

40:39.136 --> 40:43.163
As a result, Frane lost control
and attacked the victim.

40:43.240 --> 40:47.142
Why would peaceful men
like Guill and Frane

40:47.211 --> 40:50.908
want to subject themselves
to such hostile images?

40:50.981 --> 40:52.744
My investigation has uncovered

40:52.817 --> 40:55.547
a rather disturbing side
of Mari society--

40:55.653 --> 40:57.985
a black market if you will,

40:58.055 --> 41:01.388
in which many of your citizens
trade in illicit mental imagery.

41:01.492 --> 41:04.461
Guill is a very prominent figure
in this underground,

41:04.528 --> 41:07.361
or was, until l brought him
into custody.

41:12.369 --> 41:14.803
Why would any of my people

41:14.872 --> 41:17.568
want to indulge
in that kind of behavior?

41:17.641 --> 41:20.337
Apparently, outlawing
violent thought

41:20.411 --> 41:22.003
hasn't made it go away.

41:22.079 --> 41:26.072
All you've done is force people
to share it in back alleys.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.675
lt seems you have
a somewhat more...

41:28.752 --> 41:31.949
serious problem than the random
thoughts of a single alien.

41:35.526 --> 41:37.994
Even if l believed you,

41:38.062 --> 41:40.155
l'm not sure anyone else would.

41:40.231 --> 41:43.200
Then l suggest you interrogate
Guill yourselves.

41:43.267 --> 41:44.359
His engramatic record

41:44.435 --> 41:46.767
will undoubtedly confirm
what l've told you.

41:46.837 --> 41:48.634
Where is he now?

41:48.706 --> 41:50.901
We have him confined

41:50.975 --> 41:52.101
in our brig.

41:57.381 --> 41:59.440
Captain's Log, supplemental.

41:59.517 --> 42:02.816
Chief Examiner Nimira
has taken custody of Mr. Guill.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.854
Whether his arrest
will lead to reforms

42:04.889 --> 42:07.119
in the Mari justice system
is anyone's guess.

42:07.191 --> 42:09.421
ln the meantime, the Doctor
is treating Lieutenant Torres

42:09.493 --> 42:11.586
and Commander Tuvok.

42:11.662 --> 42:13.254
Fortunately, the Mari
didn't get very far

42:13.330 --> 42:14.524
with the procedure.

42:14.598 --> 42:16.759
You can return to duty,
Lieutenant,

42:16.834 --> 42:19.166
though perhaps with one
or two fewer violent engrams

42:19.236 --> 42:20.965
in that fiery head of yours.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.005
lt's all right, Doc.

42:22.072 --> 42:24.040
There are plenty more
where those came from.

42:24.108 --> 42:25.973
Duly warned.

42:26.043 --> 42:27.943
Thanks for getting me
out of there.

42:28.012 --> 42:30.344
l was merely pursuing the truth.

42:30.414 --> 42:35.647
So if l was responsible
for passing that thought,

42:35.719 --> 42:37.346
you would have let them
lobotomize me?

42:37.421 --> 42:39.480
lt is incumbent upon us
to respect the laws

42:39.557 --> 42:40.990
of the societies we visit.

42:41.058 --> 42:43.026
So...

42:43.093 --> 42:47.655
you still a fan
of the Mari legal system?

42:47.731 --> 42:50.700
My views have been
somewhat modified.

42:50.768 --> 42:53.032
Then you're not
going to lecture me

42:53.103 --> 42:54.627
about losing my temper?

42:54.705 --> 42:56.935
lf you must know,
investigating this case

42:57.007 --> 42:59.237
has given me a new respect
for your inner struggle.

42:59.310 --> 43:00.402
Really?

43:00.511 --> 43:02.376
Burdened as you are

43:02.413 --> 43:03.971
by your primitive
Klingon psyche,

43:04.048 --> 43:05.310
it is a wonder
you are able to keep

43:05.382 --> 43:06.679
your violent thoughts
under control

43:06.750 --> 43:08.240
as much as you do.

43:08.319 --> 43:11.413
Thanks...l think.

43:11.488 --> 43:12.648
You're welcome.

43:12.723 --> 43:16.420
Of course, there are
various Vulcan techniques

43:16.493 --> 43:18.723
which could help you
increase your self- control.

43:18.796 --> 43:20.127
You don't say.

43:30.741 --> 43:31.935
Come in.

43:32.009 --> 43:33.033
l must speak with you.

43:33.110 --> 43:34.304
Of course.
Have a seat.

43:34.378 --> 43:35.310
l prefer to stand.

43:35.379 --> 43:36.311
l keep forgetting.

43:36.380 --> 43:37.369
You once encouraged me

43:37.448 --> 43:38.676
to express my opinions

43:38.749 --> 43:40.717
if l had something relevant
to say.

43:40.784 --> 43:42.479
Go right ahead.

43:42.586 --> 43:45.111
You wish to return this vessel
to the Alpha Quadrant,

43:45.189 --> 43:47.180
and yet you are following
Starfleet protocol

43:47.257 --> 43:48.781
regarding first contact.

43:48.859 --> 43:50.759
The two objectives
are incompatible.

43:50.828 --> 43:52.193
How so?

43:52.262 --> 43:54.890
Your philosophy of exploration

43:54.965 --> 43:56.899
exposes Voyager
to constant risk.

43:56.967 --> 43:58.832
lf you maintain a direct course,

43:58.902 --> 44:00.597
to Earth and avoid
all extraneous contact

44:00.704 --> 44:01.671
with alien species,

44:01.705 --> 44:03.536
it will increase
your chances of survival.

44:03.607 --> 44:05.541
Well, that would make
a dull ride home.

44:05.609 --> 44:07.270
Captain?

44:07.344 --> 44:11.303
We seek out new races
because we want to,

44:11.382 --> 44:13.373
not because
we're following protocols.

44:13.450 --> 44:16.578
We have an insatiable curiosity
about the universe.

44:16.654 --> 44:20.351
Your Chief Engineer and Security
Officer were nearly lost today.

44:20.424 --> 44:21.686
That is unacceptable.

44:21.759 --> 44:24.353
To you, maybe,
but not to me or my crew.

44:24.428 --> 44:27.226
Our experience with the Mari
gave us an insight

44:27.297 --> 44:29.356
into a culture
we've never encountered.

44:31.468 --> 44:33.060
But that is irrelevant.

44:33.137 --> 44:35.799
No.
lt's how we gain knowledge.

44:37.441 --> 44:39.272
Then we are in disagreement.

44:39.343 --> 44:40.742
Good. l dread the day

44:40.811 --> 44:42.972
when everyone on this ship
agrees with me.

44:43.047 --> 44:44.776
l thank you for your opinion,

44:44.848 --> 44:47.646
but our mission
is not going to change.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.026
Dismissed.
