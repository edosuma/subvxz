Come on, stop worrying.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.297
Okay.

01:42.834 --> 01:44.568
Maybe you should have worn

What?

I'm asking him

to refinance our
mortgage, not marry me.

01:55.715 --> 01:57.214
I know.

Someone left an

Aw, man. Is it a bomb?

We're not sure
what it is yet, sir.

02:24.777 --> 02:26.310
That's why
we're checking it out.

03:13.125 --> 03:14.592
Why's everybody
laughing?

03:14.594 --> 03:16.093
It's a Spanky.

03:16.095 --> 03:17.828
What's a Spanky?

03:17.830 --> 03:19.363
The guerilla
street artist, Spanky.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.665
You've never seen
his art around town?

03:21.667 --> 03:22.833
This isn't art.

03:22.835 --> 03:24.702
This is yelling "fir""
in a packed theater.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.003
Yeah.

03:30.842 --> 03:33.911
We did everything by the
numbers with the appraisal.

03:33.913 --> 03:35.279
Mm-hmm.

03:35.281 --> 03:36.947
Even used the company
the bank recommended.

03:36.949 --> 03:40.217
Yeah. Our mortgage broker
says we're a slam dunk.

03:40.219 --> 03:42.753
Slam dunk.
Slam dunk.

03:46.124 --> 03:48.192
I'm sorry.
We're not gonna be able

03:48.194 --> 03:50.528
to refinance your mortgage
at this time.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.329
You what?
Why not?

03:52.331 --> 03:54.198
I suggest you check back
with us in a year.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.266
A year?

03:55.268 --> 03:56.700
To a year and a half.

03:56.702 --> 03:59.303
No, no, no. You hold on
to those, because

03:59.305 --> 04:00.838
there's got to be some mistake.
Okay, Danny, Danny...

04:00.840 --> 04:02.206
We got to work
this out here.

04:02.208 --> 04:03.607
You know
what my husband is

04:03.609 --> 04:05.142
really saying here
is that we have been

04:05.144 --> 04:06.544
very loyal to this bank--
20 years

04:06.546 --> 04:08.245
we've been with this bank.
Over 20 years.

04:08.247 --> 04:09.580
Yeah, so that much loyalty

04:09.582 --> 04:12.383
maybe deserves
a little bit of a reward.

04:12.385 --> 04:13.651
Big reward.

04:13.653 --> 04:15.419
We appreciate your business.

04:15.421 --> 04:19.190
We do. That's why I hope you'll
check back with us in a year.

08:01.759 --> 08:03.126
Did his mother
hate him?

08:03.128 --> 08:04.360
It's his nom de guerre.

08:04.362 --> 08:06.362
Nom de what?
Pen name. He's an artist.

08:06.364 --> 08:07.830
No one knows
his real name.

08:07.832 --> 08:09.732
We're gonna, soon.
A lot of smart people

08:09.734 --> 08:11.667

08:11.669 --> 08:13.369
The police?
London and Paris, yes.

08:13.371 --> 08:16.139
Yeah, they call him an artist.
'Cause I call him a terrorist.

08:16.141 --> 08:18.641
Terrorist? Let's not get
carried away, Chicken Little.

08:18.643 --> 08:20.910
Who you calling chicken?
As in "the sky is falling."

08:20.912 --> 08:22.378
Frank, you want
to weigh in here?

08:22.380 --> 08:25.548
I don't think we need to move
to code red just yet, Sergeant.

08:25.550 --> 08:26.782
Exactly.
And I don't know

08:26.784 --> 08:28.784
anything about art,
but I do know the law.

08:28.786 --> 08:32.554
And what he did was a felony,
punishable by up to 25 years.

08:32.557 --> 08:34.256
25 years
for a stunt?

08:34.259 --> 08:35.857
You can't intentionally
leave a bag

08:35.860 --> 08:38.427
that looks and sounds like
a bomb in a public place.

08:38.429 --> 08:39.729
Not in this
day and age.

08:39.731 --> 08:40.897
But it wasn't a bomb.

08:40.899 --> 08:42.565
It was ticking.
It was a balloon.

08:42.567 --> 08:43.666
That's not the point.

08:43.668 --> 08:45.535
The point is it was made
to look like a bomb!

08:45.537 --> 08:47.303
That's a threat.
That's intimidation.

08:47.305 --> 08:48.938
That is the very
definition of terrorism.

08:48.940 --> 08:51.774
We call this guy a terrorist,
and all that word implies

08:51.776 --> 08:53.276
in this day and age?

08:53.278 --> 08:54.278
We're not.

08:54.279 --> 08:55.511
But he is.
You go out with that,

08:55.513 --> 08:57.280
lumping Spanky with Al Qaeda,

08:57.282 --> 08:58.681
the boss becomes a punch line

08:58.683 --> 09:00.149
for the left
and the right,

09:00.151 --> 09:01.817
from sea to
shining sea!

09:01.819 --> 09:04.020
We're a police department,
not an arts foundation!

09:04.022 --> 09:05.488
Stop!

09:09.059 --> 09:11.427
You're hurting my head.

09:13.530 --> 09:14.864
He's not a terrorist.

09:14.866 --> 09:18.267
He's a person of interest
in a felony hazardous act.

09:18.269 --> 09:20.703
And we do not arrest and charge

09:20.705 --> 09:23.506
on the basis
of profession or profile,

09:23.508 --> 09:25.608
only on the law.

09:25.610 --> 09:27.810
Now figure it out!

09:30.681 --> 09:31.981
Without making it

09:31.983 --> 09:34.717
more work for me. Copy?

09:49.766 --> 09:51.367
What are we doing out here?

09:51.369 --> 09:53.869
Male white with the scars,
he kept checking that window

09:53.871 --> 09:55.338
and looking
in this direction.

09:55.340 --> 09:57.773
A lookout, hand signals--
from everything you've told me,

09:57.775 --> 09:59.775
they seem like
a pretty sophisticated group.

09:59.777 --> 10:01.744
Yeah, they knew
what they were doing.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.047
Which is why
they would

10:05.049 --> 10:07.216
probably pick a building
with the highest elevation

10:07.218 --> 10:08.851
and the most cover.

10:08.853 --> 10:11.287
Perfect spot
for a lookout.

10:11.289 --> 10:13.756
This building--
come on, let's take a look.

10:23.634 --> 10:25.701
Perfect sight line to the bank.

10:25.703 --> 10:27.970
Unobstructed view
of the surrounding streets.

10:27.972 --> 10:29.538
From up here,
you'd know

10:29.540 --> 10:32.074
in a heartbeat
if the cops were coming.

10:37.981 --> 10:39.949
What are you looking for?

10:39.951 --> 10:42.585
Mistakes.

10:42.587 --> 10:44.387
Cigarette butt.

10:44.389 --> 10:45.955
Well, you can't smoke
in these buildings.

10:45.957 --> 10:47.223
People probably sneak up here.

10:47.225 --> 10:48.591
It could be anybody's.

10:48.593 --> 10:51.394
Yeah, but it's field-stripped.

10:51.396 --> 10:52.495
No middle-management
desk jockey's

10:52.497 --> 10:54.730
gonna do that.

10:54.732 --> 10:57.133
Or that.

10:57.135 --> 10:59.101
What do you got?

10:59.103 --> 11:00.269
Boot prints.

11:00.271 --> 11:03.306
When I was in
the military,

11:03.308 --> 11:05.074
it seemed like
I spent half my time

11:05.076 --> 11:06.909
polishing my boots.
Call me crazy,

11:06.911 --> 11:10.012
but those look like
military-issued boot prints.

11:11.982 --> 11:15.017
Son of a bitch.

11:16.753 --> 11:18.621
Sid, can I talk
to you a sec?

11:18.623 --> 11:20.990
I got a big head,
but I'm all ears.

11:20.992 --> 11:22.024
The commissioner
likes you.

11:22.026 --> 11:23.959
You remind him of
who he was as a cop.

11:23.961 --> 11:25.628
That's why you're
valuable around here.

11:25.630 --> 11:27.163
That's nice to hear.
But he's not

11:27.165 --> 11:29.465
a cop on the beat anymore,
he's the commissioner.

11:29.467 --> 11:30.566
I know that.

11:30.568 --> 11:31.367
Do you?

11:31.369 --> 11:33.703
Yeah. So?

11:33.705 --> 11:35.305
So you can't light him up
like that, Sid.

11:35.306 --> 11:36.739
I didn't light up anything.

11:36.741 --> 11:37.840
You used the word "terrorist."

11:37.842 --> 11:39.809
If it walks like a duck...

11:39.811 --> 11:41.610
I don't want to get
back on that treadmill.

11:41.612 --> 11:43.546
The point is, it's our job

11:43.548 --> 11:45.414
to steer the commissioner
to his best decision,

11:45.416 --> 11:47.416
not your first
instinct.

11:47.418 --> 11:49.085
I'll take that as an insult.

11:49.087 --> 11:51.053
Don't.
Then what do you mean?

11:51.055 --> 11:52.822
I just think,
in the next few months,

11:52.824 --> 11:54.623
maybe it's best
if you followed my lead.

11:54.625 --> 11:55.591
My instinct is

11:55.593 --> 11:56.592
what got me here, Garrett.

11:56.594 --> 11:57.793
That's what cops rely on.

11:57.795 --> 12:00.129
To my point,
you're not in the field.

12:00.131 --> 12:01.831
There's finesse,
gradations,

12:01.833 --> 12:04.166
options and impacts
to be considered.

12:04.168 --> 12:05.768
I'm not here to tap dance.

12:05.770 --> 12:07.470
I'm not saying you are, but...

12:07.472 --> 12:09.105
'Cause then the commissioner
would have two of you

12:09.107 --> 12:10.806
instead of one of you
and one of me.

12:10.808 --> 12:11.741
There's a learning curve, Sid.

12:11.743 --> 12:12.842
And I'm on it.

12:12.844 --> 12:15.111
You want to be an asset
or a liability?

12:15.113 --> 12:18.280
You really asking me that?

12:32.130 --> 12:33.730
Give me one reason
why I should help you.

12:33.731 --> 12:35.164
Because I'm your
favorite brother.

12:35.166 --> 12:36.132
Says who?

12:36.134 --> 12:38.334
Says the way you laugh
at all my jokes.

12:38.336 --> 12:39.635
I'm laughing at you,
not with you.

12:39.637 --> 12:40.903
Will you come on?

12:40.905 --> 12:42.671
If you don't help me out,
I got to fight through

12:42.673 --> 12:44.874
13 rounds of Department
of Defense red tape.

12:44.876 --> 12:47.076
That could take weeks
if not months.

12:47.078 --> 12:49.445
Well, I haven't spoken to
Holbrooke in over a year.

12:49.447 --> 12:51.881
Well, this is a great excuse
for the two of you to catch up.

12:51.883 --> 12:54.383
Yeah, except I wasn't
interested in reconnecting.

12:54.385 --> 12:56.685
Just like I wasn't
interested in a second date.

12:56.687 --> 12:58.487
I thought
he didn't call you back.

12:58.489 --> 13:00.723
Excuse me.
I didn't call him.

13:00.725 --> 13:03.592
Okay, well, look, what's
the worst that can happen, huh?

13:03.594 --> 13:05.995
You get a free cup of coffee
out of the deal, right?

13:05.997 --> 13:07.763
What makes you so sure
the guy you're looking for

13:07.765 --> 13:08.931
is military anyway?

13:08.933 --> 13:10.966
The footprint.
Besides the footprint

13:10.968 --> 13:14.270
of a boot that I'm sure I could
get at any Army Navy store.

13:14.272 --> 13:16.372
Filter from his cigarette
was separated from the tobacco,

13:16.374 --> 13:19.175
the paper was crumbled up
with no signs of weed remaining.

13:19.177 --> 13:22.077
I'm sorry, was that
an answer to my question?

13:22.079 --> 13:23.379
It's military procedure.

13:23.381 --> 13:24.780
We're trained not to leave

13:24.782 --> 13:26.315
any traces
of ourselves behind, okay?

13:26.317 --> 13:28.350
So you take your
cigarette butts with you.

13:28.352 --> 13:30.352
I'm pretty sure that's
what he was doing,

13:30.354 --> 13:31.620
but he must have
dropped it.

13:31.622 --> 13:32.922
How do you even know that?

13:32.924 --> 13:34.089
I know because I know.

13:34.091 --> 13:35.858
Look, can't you just
have Holbrooke

13:35.860 --> 13:37.960
run a test
on the DNA I gave you?

13:37.962 --> 13:40.663
And if I'm wrong, hey, I'll
spring for the coffee myself.

13:43.366 --> 13:44.533
You're not wrong.

13:44.535 --> 13:47.436
The DNA on the cigarette
belongs to

13:47.438 --> 13:49.805
a Retired Army Sergeant
Joe Raymond.

13:49.807 --> 13:51.474
You were testing me.

13:51.476 --> 13:53.843
Yes, because it cost me
more than a cup of coffee.

13:53.845 --> 13:55.344
I have to have dinner with him.

13:55.346 --> 13:57.880
Well, lucky you.

13:57.882 --> 14:00.449
Thank you.

14:00.451 --> 14:02.017
For the free dinner?

14:02.019 --> 14:03.519
You're welcome.

14:24.518 --> 14:25.885
Joe Raymond.

14:25.887 --> 14:28.087
Detective Reagan.
This is Detective Baez.

14:28.089 --> 14:29.622
Detectives, how can I help you?

14:29.624 --> 14:33.860
We're with the Lost and Found
department, Joe.

14:33.862 --> 14:36.062
And we found
something you lost.

14:36.064 --> 14:38.097
I'm not sure I understand,
Detective.

14:38.099 --> 14:39.232
You dropped it on the rooftop

14:39.234 --> 14:40.733
when you were doing lookout
for the robbery.

14:40.735 --> 14:42.001
I wasn't on any roof.

14:42.003 --> 14:43.936
I don't know anything
about a bank robbery.

14:46.373 --> 14:48.407
We didn't say it was a bank.

14:50.244 --> 14:51.978
Why don't you
come with us.

14:51.980 --> 14:53.579
We're gonna have a little
chat down at the squad?

14:53.581 --> 14:54.947
Wait, stop!

14:54.949 --> 14:56.082
Am I under arrest?

14:56.084 --> 14:57.583
We'll talk about it
at the squad.

14:57.585 --> 14:59.018
No, am I under arrest
for something or am I not?

14:59.020 --> 15:01.420
This is real bad
for you, Joe.

15:01.422 --> 15:03.689
Anything you do now in
the way of cooperating

15:03.691 --> 15:05.658
will go a long way
towards helping you.

15:05.660 --> 15:07.460
Yes or no, Detective?

15:07.462 --> 15:09.762
Technically, no.

15:09.764 --> 15:11.964
Then have a nice day.

15:16.303 --> 15:18.804
We'll sit on his place,
see if he goes anywhere

15:18.806 --> 15:20.239
or anyone
comes to visit.

15:20.241 --> 15:21.407
We could do that.

15:21.409 --> 15:24.110
You got a better idea?

15:24.112 --> 15:27.647
Raymond just made a call to a
restaurant in the East Village.

15:27.649 --> 15:29.282
You went up
on his phone?

15:29.284 --> 15:30.983
I got a court order.

15:30.985 --> 15:32.685
I know. Good work.

15:32.687 --> 15:35.688
Wow. Like that's never happened.

15:39.293 --> 15:41.527
That damn Spanky's at it again.

15:41.529 --> 15:44.130
Had to shut down the area
around Bethesda Fountain.

15:44.132 --> 15:45.498
Press conference?

15:45.500 --> 15:46.599
Just a release today.

15:46.601 --> 15:48.501
Try to tilt it in our favor.

15:50.370 --> 15:53.105
Like I wouldn't?

15:57.878 --> 16:00.580
I know you disagree with me
but it's my call.

16:00.582 --> 16:03.849
I'm just trying to look out
for you. For the office.

16:03.851 --> 16:05.318
Public perception's
gonna be

16:05.320 --> 16:07.553
we're launching missiles
at a gopher.

16:10.958 --> 16:13.526
So this is about Gormley.

16:15.762 --> 16:18.898
He's got a job to do,
same as you do.

16:18.900 --> 16:21.234
I worry about him
having your ear.

16:21.236 --> 16:23.302
Well, don't.

16:23.304 --> 16:25.738
Look, I like you;

16:25.740 --> 16:28.975
I respect you; in many ways,
I genuinely look up to you.

16:28.977 --> 16:31.377
But I think you have
a blind spot

16:31.379 --> 16:33.646
when it comes to how you view
your command.

16:33.648 --> 16:35.648
Do you, now?

16:35.650 --> 16:36.749
Yes.

16:36.751 --> 16:38.551
And lately I think
you put too much emphasis

16:38.553 --> 16:41.687
on how you're connected to your
officers and not enough emphasis

16:41.689 --> 16:43.756
on how you're connected to,
and perceived by,

16:43.758 --> 16:45.057
the rest of the world out there.

16:45.059 --> 16:46.926
It does matter.

16:52.933 --> 16:56.002
Bring me the release
when you have it, please.

17:02.776 --> 17:06.746
Let's hope this Joe Raymond
wasn't just ordering takeout.

17:06.748 --> 17:09.281
Keep your eyes open for anything
that doesn't look right.

17:09.284 --> 17:10.915
Like that Cobb salad?

17:10.917 --> 17:14.319
Okay, folks,
you ready for some chow time?

17:19.026 --> 17:20.526
That's her.

17:20.528 --> 17:21.794
Who?

17:21.796 --> 17:23.462
It's the girl
from the bank.

17:23.464 --> 17:24.664
You sure?

17:24.665 --> 17:25.998
It's her voice.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.334
Excuse me.

17:28.336 --> 17:29.635
We're ready to order.

17:29.637 --> 17:31.637
Um, this isn't
actually my section,

17:31.639 --> 17:32.972
so I'll get your server.

17:32.974 --> 17:33.939
Please?

17:33.941 --> 17:35.608
We're in a bit of a rush.

17:37.210 --> 17:39.078
You were right.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.346
I am a cop.

17:40.348 --> 17:43.416
Uh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:43.418 --> 17:44.717
Yeah, you do.

17:44.719 --> 17:46.519
Joe Raymond called
you 40 minutes ago.

17:46.521 --> 17:48.120
Yeah, how about
you tell your boss

17:48.122 --> 17:49.789
you're gonna
take a walk outside.

17:51.958 --> 17:52.958
Danny.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.034
Hold it!

18:07.908 --> 18:09.241
Hold it!

18:09.243 --> 18:11.143
Stop!

18:11.145 --> 18:12.978
Move it!

18:16.383 --> 18:18.217
Hold it!
Watch out!

18:38.672 --> 18:40.673
I think you're gonna need I.T.

18:40.675 --> 18:42.375
to take a look
at our server again.

18:42.377 --> 18:44.310
I never got the e-mail
on this meeting.

18:44.312 --> 18:45.745
Garrett, I'm sorry.
It's fine.

18:45.747 --> 18:49.348
I'm not mad,  but we .

18:49.350 --> 18:51.884
Garrett, no.

18:51.886 --> 18:53.452
You didn't get the e-mail
for the meeting

18:53.454 --> 18:54.954
because you're not on the list.

18:54.956 --> 18:56.889
What do you mean?

19:00.193 --> 19:02.995
Oh.

19:05.732 --> 19:08.667
I see.

19:08.669 --> 19:09.669
I'm sorry.

19:09.670 --> 19:12.071
No, not at all.

19:21.581 --> 19:23.282
All right, Angela Cabot,
who was your friend?

19:23.284 --> 19:25.384
Why'd he do the hundred-yard
dash when he saw us?

19:25.386 --> 19:26.952
I don't know.

19:26.954 --> 19:28.721
You'll have to ask him that,
won't you?

19:28.723 --> 19:29.688
That's okay.

19:29.690 --> 19:30.823
I know who he is.

19:30.825 --> 19:32.391
He was the one checking
the window in the bank.

19:32.393 --> 19:33.859
I recognized the scar

19:33.861 --> 19:34.894
on his wrist.

19:34.896 --> 19:36.996
Lot of people have scars.

19:36.998 --> 19:39.365
Yeah, a lot of people
don't run from the cops either.

19:39.367 --> 19:40.900
Anything else?

19:40.902 --> 19:42.468
My boss is gonna
start getting pissed.

19:42.470 --> 19:43.869
Yeah, I got
something else.

19:43.871 --> 19:45.604
How long did you serve
in the military?

19:45.606 --> 19:47.807
Who says I did?

19:47.809 --> 19:50.109
Well, the hand signals
used in the bank says you did.

19:50.111 --> 19:52.011
Nice try.

19:52.013 --> 19:53.879
You referred to lunch
as "chow time."

19:53.881 --> 19:55.347
Military jargon.

19:55.349 --> 19:56.382
Coincidence?

19:56.384 --> 19:59.852
I did one tour.

19:59.854 --> 20:01.454
12 months in Baqubah.

20:01.456 --> 20:02.555
There you have it.

20:02.557 --> 20:04.023
So you did a tour in Baqubah,

20:04.025 --> 20:05.624
same as Joe Raymond,
incidentally.

20:05.626 --> 20:08.561
And also same, I'm guessing,
as, uh, crazy legs

20:08.563 --> 20:09.929
who just took off here.

20:09.931 --> 20:11.363
So want to tell us

20:11.365 --> 20:12.498
what the hell's going on with

20:12.500 --> 20:14.133
a bunch of former soldiers
robbing banks?

20:15.035 --> 20:16.969
Don't say a word.
Who the hell are you?

20:16.971 --> 20:18.370
My name is Eli Campbell.

20:18.372 --> 20:20.506
I'm her attorney,
and this interview's over.

20:20.508 --> 20:21.974
It's not an interview,
Eli Campbell,

20:21.976 --> 20:23.909
it's a conversation
amongst friends.

20:23.911 --> 20:25.778
Not anymore it's not.
Let's go.

20:25.780 --> 20:27.012
You called your lawyer?

20:27.014 --> 20:28.848
You got a problem with that?
Innocent people

20:28.850 --> 20:31.150
don't usually have their lawyers
on speed dial.

20:31.152 --> 20:33.986
Another word out of you, and
I'll file harassment charges.

20:40.393 --> 20:42.595
Have a nice day, Detectives.

20:45.398 --> 20:46.732
He was with them.

20:46.734 --> 20:48.467
What?
The lawyer.

20:48.469 --> 20:50.569
He was the one bagging the cash
in the bank.

20:50.571 --> 20:52.004
He had a bandage
over his tattoo.

20:52.006 --> 20:53.772
Seriously?

20:53.774 --> 20:55.441
Son of a bitch.

20:55.443 --> 20:58.444
What the hell is going on here?

21:08.657 --> 21:10.625
That's not exactly
how I remember it.

21:10.627 --> 21:11.759
Oh, really?

21:11.761 --> 21:12.694
Mm-hmm.

21:12.696 --> 21:14.862
How exactly do
you remember it?

21:14.864 --> 21:16.964
Well...
Hi.

21:16.966 --> 21:19.634
Daniel Fitzgerald Reagan,
what are you doing here?

21:19.636 --> 21:20.968
I need your help.

21:20.970 --> 21:22.603
Uh, no, actually I need
your help.

21:22.605 --> 21:24.439
My help?
Yeah.

21:24.441 --> 21:25.606
Who is this?

21:25.608 --> 21:26.874
My brother.
Her favorite brother.

21:26.876 --> 21:27.942
My least favorite brother.

21:27.944 --> 21:29.477
And I already told you no,
so drop it.

21:29.479 --> 21:30.812
He can decide for himself.

21:31.947 --> 21:33.981
Drop what?

21:33.983 --> 21:36.150
Nothing. You've already
done enough, and Danny is

21:36.152 --> 21:37.152
just leaving.

21:37.153 --> 21:38.086
Good-bye, Danny.

21:38.088 --> 21:39.487
This is about that bank robbery.

21:39.489 --> 21:42.056
You know what,
it is about that bank robbery.

21:42.058 --> 21:44.659
Did you know
they were all military?

21:44.661 --> 21:47.862
Angela Cabot, Michael McCarty,

21:47.864 --> 21:48.996
Joe Raymond,

21:48.998 --> 21:52.200
even the lawyer,
Eli Campbell.

21:52.202 --> 21:54.836
They all served together
in Baqubah.

21:56.138 --> 21:57.372
I'm a vet myself.

21:57.374 --> 21:59.674
It's the last thing
I ever wanted to discover.

22:00.876 --> 22:03.644
What are you looking for?

22:03.646 --> 22:05.279
Well, as far as I can gather,
they were all

22:05.281 --> 22:06.948
part of a five-man
Stryker team.

22:06.950 --> 22:10.618
And you want to know
who the fifth man was.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.854
Right. Why wasn't
he part of the score?

22:12.856 --> 22:14.288
Why was he the odd man out?

22:14.290 --> 22:17.692
You think maybe they approached
him, he turned them down.

22:17.694 --> 22:18.793
Exactly.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.294
And if he turned
them down,

22:20.296 --> 22:23.131
maybe there's something there,
maybe I can get him to talk.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.265
Sam, it is
completely understandable

22:24.267 --> 22:26.634
if you are not
comfortable with this.

22:31.173 --> 22:33.141
Let's see what I can do.

22:34.476 --> 22:36.377
Thank you, Sam.

22:37.346 --> 22:39.781
How's your salad?

22:53.595 --> 22:55.596
Good morning.

22:55.598 --> 22:57.331
Not very.

22:57.333 --> 22:59.700
Okay, it was until now.

22:59.702 --> 23:02.270
You froze me
out of that meeting.

23:02.272 --> 23:04.071
What, that?

23:04.073 --> 23:05.473
That was a police meeting.

23:05.475 --> 23:07.742
It had no public relations
component.

23:07.744 --> 23:10.478
So that's all I am,
public relations?

23:10.480 --> 23:11.913
Well, you are,
after all,

23:11.915 --> 23:14.315
my deputy commissioner
of public information.

23:14.317 --> 23:16.284
And I sat in hundreds
of police meetings

23:16.286 --> 23:18.853
just like yesterday's,
but suddenly I'm disinvited.

23:18.855 --> 23:20.822
Uninvited. "Disinvited" implies

23:20.824 --> 23:22.790
you were invited
in the first place.

23:22.792 --> 23:25.827
Oh, thank you for clarifying.
I feel much better now.

23:25.829 --> 23:27.495
Cut it out.

23:27.497 --> 23:28.863
It was a purely

23:28.865 --> 23:29.897
technical huddle.

23:29.899 --> 23:31.899
I didn't want
to waste your time.

23:31.901 --> 23:33.434
Look, if this
is about yesterday...

23:33.436 --> 23:35.303
What about yesterday?
What I said.

23:35.305 --> 23:37.004
You said what you
were thinking,

23:37.006 --> 23:39.674
which I would encourage
you to continue doing.

23:39.676 --> 23:41.409
Hard to stay encouraged
when saying what I was thinking

23:41.411 --> 23:42.543
got me sat on the bench.

23:42.545 --> 23:44.679
It didn't.

23:44.681 --> 23:46.681
As I just said.

23:50.953 --> 23:53.387
And while I got you here,
there's something

23:53.389 --> 23:55.389
we need to get straight:
Gormley stays.

23:55.391 --> 23:58.192
You say it like I was
trying to get rid of him.

23:58.194 --> 24:01.662
I have no idea what your
intentions are, but he stays.

24:01.664 --> 24:04.699
Because he is valuable,
because I need his input.

24:04.701 --> 24:05.867
As opposed to, say, mine.

24:05.869 --> 24:09.303
In addition to yours!

24:09.305 --> 24:12.773
I'm just asking you
to get used to it.

24:12.775 --> 24:14.375
Asking?

24:14.377 --> 24:16.911
What, do you need an order?

24:16.913 --> 24:18.946
No, sir. Will that be all?

24:20.883 --> 24:24.318
I don't know. You're the one
who came barging in here.

24:25.787 --> 24:27.455
Anything you want to discuss?

24:27.457 --> 24:30.291
I think we're done here.

24:35.230 --> 24:37.765
We don't know what to expect
from this guy,

24:37.767 --> 24:39.934
so be ready for anything, okay?

24:47.776 --> 24:49.610
Who is it?

24:49.612 --> 24:51.812
Police.
Open the door, please.

24:57.019 --> 24:59.186
Richard Sullivan?

24:59.188 --> 25:00.821
Yes.

25:00.823 --> 25:02.189
Detective Reagan.

25:02.191 --> 25:03.558
This is Detective Baez.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.359
You think we can have a word?

25:05.361 --> 25:07.328
Of course.

25:08.997 --> 25:10.698
Can I offer you

25:10.700 --> 25:13.401
anything to drink,
Detective, uh...

25:13.403 --> 25:14.936
uh, Detect... uh...

25:14.938 --> 25:15.970
Baez.

25:15.972 --> 25:17.371
Yes. That's right.

25:17.373 --> 25:18.940
I'm, uh... I'm sorry.

25:18.942 --> 25:22.276
I'm not, uh...
I'm not, uh...

25:24.112 --> 25:25.613
I forget things.

25:25.615 --> 25:26.547
It's okay.

25:26.549 --> 25:28.616
Nothing for
me, thanks.

25:28.618 --> 25:30.051
Where'd you serve?

25:30.053 --> 25:31.919
Baqubah.

25:31.921 --> 25:34.021
Two tours Fallujah, myself.
Marines.

25:34.023 --> 25:36.190
I was, uh...

25:36.192 --> 25:37.925
I was with the, uh...

25:37.927 --> 25:40.928
Sixth Stryker Brigade.

25:40.930 --> 25:42.363
May I?

25:45.167 --> 25:46.701
They your buddies?

25:46.703 --> 25:48.302
Yeah.

25:48.304 --> 25:49.670
That's right.

25:52.274 --> 25:54.709
So, what is it
I can help you with?

25:56.144 --> 25:57.144
Sorry.

25:57.146 --> 25:59.146
It's okay.

25:59.148 --> 26:00.881
IED explosion.

26:00.883 --> 26:03.484
Took the roof right off
the Stryker we were in.

26:03.486 --> 26:05.486
We'd been hit before,
but this time...

26:06.688 --> 26:08.656
...this time we took it bad.

26:08.658 --> 26:10.725
I'm very sorry.

26:10.727 --> 26:13.194
Funny thing is,
when I lost my legs,

26:13.196 --> 26:15.763
I was devastated.

26:15.765 --> 26:17.798
Now...

26:17.800 --> 26:20.167
I realize that part was nothing.

26:23.305 --> 26:26.641
It's losing my mind
that's killing me.

26:26.643 --> 26:28.542
Concussions?

26:28.544 --> 26:31.779
Traumatic brain injury.

26:31.781 --> 26:33.981
I used to have a 140 IQ.

26:33.983 --> 26:37.918
Now I'm lucky if
I can follow the grocery list.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.420
Look, I don't
want to bore you

26:39.422 --> 26:41.022
with my-my sob story.

26:41.024 --> 26:43.224
Truth is, that's
all behind me now.

26:43.226 --> 26:45.626
I'm on my way back
to being the man I was.

26:45.628 --> 26:47.328
That your wife?

26:48.263 --> 26:49.764
Angela.

26:49.766 --> 26:51.465
Bless her soul.

26:51.467 --> 26:53.801
She put together
a charity in my name.

26:53.803 --> 26:55.803
They raised $100,000.

26:55.805 --> 26:57.605
I start treatment next week.

26:58.740 --> 27:00.007
She's beautiful.

27:00.009 --> 27:01.909
Yeah.

27:01.911 --> 27:03.077
How long you married?

27:03.079 --> 27:05.513
Four years.

27:05.515 --> 27:07.982
We did a tour together and got
hitched when we came stateside.

27:07.984 --> 27:10.284
Then I went back
for two more tours

27:10.286 --> 27:12.553
and, um...

27:14.456 --> 27:16.524
...came home like this.

27:18.126 --> 27:20.461
Tough break. Sorry.

27:20.463 --> 27:23.664
Not at all. I'm lucky.

27:23.666 --> 27:28.102
I know lots of guys
came home just like me,

27:28.104 --> 27:30.071
but their wives
couldn't take it.

27:30.073 --> 27:32.506
And I honestly
can't say I blame them.

27:32.508 --> 27:35.042
But, you know,
like I said, I been lucky.

27:35.044 --> 27:38.579
Angela would do
anything for me.

27:38.581 --> 27:40.981
Yeah, I bet she would.

27:40.983 --> 27:43.484
Yeah, uh, thanks for your time,

27:43.486 --> 27:44.885
and, uh,

27:44.887 --> 27:46.854
good luck with your recovery.

27:46.856 --> 27:48.355
But you forgot to tell me
what it is

27:48.357 --> 27:49.390
you wanted to talk to me about.

27:49.392 --> 27:51.926
Uh...

27:51.928 --> 27:53.427
Uh, burglaries
in the neighborhood.

27:53.429 --> 27:55.362
Just wondered
if you'd heard anything.

27:55.364 --> 27:57.932
Not a thing,
but I'll keep an eye out.

27:57.934 --> 27:59.266
Okay.

27:59.268 --> 28:01.202
Sorry to take your time.

28:12.915 --> 28:15.015
I hate this job.

28:15.017 --> 28:16.550
Yeah.

28:22.657 --> 28:24.892
Good night. Bye.
Good night.

28:31.333 --> 28:33.300
Hey.

28:33.302 --> 28:34.969
What do you want?

28:34.971 --> 28:36.103
I don't know.

28:36.105 --> 28:37.938
Part of me
wants to lock you up,

28:37.940 --> 28:39.940
the other part
wants to turn the other way.

28:39.942 --> 28:41.475
Do I get to pick?

28:41.477 --> 28:42.910
Are you confessing?

28:42.912 --> 28:44.578
No.
Well...

28:44.580 --> 28:47.014
Spent some time
with your husband today.

28:47.016 --> 28:49.583
What did you say?

28:49.585 --> 28:51.619
I didn't say anything,
'cause believe it or not,

28:51.621 --> 28:53.220
I want to help.

28:53.222 --> 28:55.656
We don't need any help.

28:55.658 --> 28:57.458
Look, I know he's been
waiting three years

28:57.460 --> 28:59.326
for Veterans Affairs
to approve his treatment.

28:59.328 --> 29:01.796
That's as long
as he served over there.

29:01.798 --> 29:03.731
And that would make
a lot of people--

29:03.733 --> 29:05.866
especially a jury-- understand,

29:05.868 --> 29:07.902
maybe, why you took
matters into

29:07.904 --> 29:09.436
your own hands the way you did.

29:09.438 --> 29:11.872
You'll forgive me if I've lost
my faith in the system.

29:11.874 --> 29:13.274
Look, I can't
change the system,

29:13.276 --> 29:15.276
and you will go away
for a long time,

29:15.278 --> 29:16.877
but how long depends on you.

29:16.879 --> 29:18.445
Hey.

29:18.447 --> 29:21.916
You cooperate, I'll put in
a good word with the D.A.

29:21.918 --> 29:26.086
I've had a long day and night
on my feet, Detective.

29:26.088 --> 29:27.855
I'm trying to help.

29:27.857 --> 29:29.790
I don't want to see things
get any worse

29:29.792 --> 29:31.392
than they already are
for your husband.

29:31.394 --> 29:34.628
Why do you care so much,
Detective?

29:37.132 --> 29:39.300
Because I was there, too.

29:39.302 --> 29:41.902
But you came home okay.

29:41.904 --> 29:43.804
On the outside.

29:43.806 --> 29:45.472
Look, Angela,

29:45.474 --> 29:47.141
I'm this close.

29:47.143 --> 29:49.610
And when I get you--
which I will--

29:49.612 --> 29:52.713
you're all going away
for a very long time.

29:59.855 --> 30:02.022
Think about what I said.

30:20.252 --> 30:22.153
Maybe you could just
look the other way.

30:22.155 --> 30:25.190
Jack, she
and her friends

30:25.192 --> 30:26.192
robbed a bank.

30:26.193 --> 30:27.959
That's a crime--
a serious crime.

30:27.961 --> 30:29.694
I know, but it was
for a good cause.

30:29.696 --> 30:31.262
Doesn't work
that way, Jack.

30:31.264 --> 30:33.097
You follow that logic
all the way through,

30:33.099 --> 30:34.432
and we're living
in anarchy.

30:34.434 --> 30:35.800
Yeah, where anyone can
do anything they want,

30:35.802 --> 30:37.502
so long as they
feel like it's justified.

30:37.504 --> 30:38.736
But I know
where you're coming from.

30:38.738 --> 30:39.904
Yeah, me too.

30:39.906 --> 30:41.739
Don't think it hasn't
crossed my mind

30:41.741 --> 30:44.542
to just tell them all
to get out of town.

30:44.544 --> 30:46.311
Which would make you
an accomplice.

30:46.313 --> 30:48.546
Which, in this case,
would be an honor.

30:48.548 --> 30:50.815
Don't romanticize it.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.152
Not at this table.

30:54.154 --> 30:56.387
Look, I'm a vet, like you

30:56.389 --> 30:57.956
and you, and I hate

30:57.958 --> 31:00.391
seeing her husband
suffer the way he is

31:00.393 --> 31:02.360
without any help
from the government

31:02.362 --> 31:05.163
he put his life on the line
to protect.

31:05.165 --> 31:07.098
Nobody likes that.

31:07.100 --> 31:08.933
Doesn't mean
the only alternative

31:08.935 --> 31:11.269
is to go out and rob a bank.

31:11.271 --> 31:14.138
I know. But we got a vet
who desperately needs help,

31:14.140 --> 31:16.274
and the only thing
stopping him from getting it

31:16.276 --> 31:18.109
is gonna be me
locking up his girl

31:18.111 --> 31:19.677
and her merry band of thieves.

31:19.679 --> 31:21.513
That's if you can prove it.

31:21.515 --> 31:23.014
Yeah, Grandpa's right.
You're feeling guilty

31:23.016 --> 31:25.517
over a collar
you can't even make yet.

31:26.685 --> 31:28.486
But you think you can make it.

31:28.488 --> 31:30.388
I know I can make it.

31:30.390 --> 31:31.523
How?

31:31.525 --> 31:33.057
The other night, when
she left the restaurant,

31:33.059 --> 31:34.959
she took the
uptown train.

31:34.961 --> 31:36.528
So?

31:36.530 --> 31:38.863
If she was going home, she would
have taken the downtown train.

31:38.865 --> 31:40.431
Yeah, well, maybe she was
running some errands, you know?

31:40.433 --> 31:42.000
Or-or meeting
some friends for dinner.

31:42.002 --> 31:43.968
Except she wasn't.

31:43.970 --> 31:45.837
I followed her and got pictures.

31:45.839 --> 31:46.871
Of?

31:46.873 --> 31:49.641
Extracurricular activities.

31:49.643 --> 31:52.277
What's wrong with that? We have
those all the time at school.

31:52.279 --> 31:54.445
Not the school kind, honey.

31:54.447 --> 31:56.214
Okay, so that
might not be right,

31:56.216 --> 31:57.615
but it doesn't make it illegal.

31:57.617 --> 31:59.384
Also doesn't
prove she robbed a bank.

31:59.386 --> 32:00.885
Not yet. But it will.

32:00.887 --> 32:01.853
How?

32:01.855 --> 32:03.988
He can use it as leverage.

32:03.990 --> 32:06.624
Either she confesses
or he reveals the photos.

32:06.626 --> 32:08.693
Then you arrest her
and you capture

32:08.695 --> 32:11.563
the cash from the robbery,
and that leaves her husband...

32:11.565 --> 32:13.731
Right back
where he started from.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.236
That's not right either.

32:28.213 --> 32:29.948
You got a minute?

32:32.184 --> 32:33.885
A minute.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.588
I just got a call
from <i>The New York Times</i>

32:36.590 --> 32:38.756
about Spanky.

32:38.758 --> 32:41.826
The investigation's ongoing;
more as the situations warrant.

32:41.828 --> 32:44.128
From their
Arts and Leisure section.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.598
You're kidding.
No.

32:46.600 --> 32:49.267
They're putting together
a piece about how the NYPD

32:49.269 --> 32:52.070
is trying to save
New York from art.

32:52.072 --> 32:53.571
Well, today's the day.

32:53.573 --> 32:55.506
Now I have really
heard everything.

32:55.508 --> 32:58.743
Do you want me to make you
or Sergeant Gormley available?

32:58.745 --> 33:01.346
Seriously?

33:01.348 --> 33:02.380
I have to ask.

33:02.382 --> 33:03.915
Neither.

33:03.917 --> 33:06.084
What about me?

33:06.086 --> 33:08.953
What would you say?

33:08.955 --> 33:10.321
That it's a ridiculous premise

33:10.323 --> 33:12.357
for an alternative
college newspaper,

33:12.359 --> 33:15.093
much less the Old Gray Lady.

33:15.095 --> 33:17.795
Oh.

33:19.932 --> 33:22.333
You were right about this
from the start.

33:22.335 --> 33:23.768
Correction.

33:23.770 --> 33:25.837
You and Sergeant Gormley
were right

33:25.839 --> 33:27.972
about this from the start,
and I missed it.

33:27.974 --> 33:30.308
It was a fastball right down
the middle of the plate,

33:30.310 --> 33:32.477
and I never got the bat
off my shoulder.

33:32.479 --> 33:35.613
Not down the middle;
it just nicked the corner.

33:35.615 --> 33:38.416
Regardless, I missed it.

33:38.418 --> 33:42.387
And what's worse than that,
I blasted Sergeant Gormley,

33:42.389 --> 33:44.822
the guy who hit it
on the screws.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.861
I owe him an apology.

33:51.697 --> 33:54.966
Yes, you do.

33:54.968 --> 33:57.268
I'll get him a nice bottle.

33:57.270 --> 33:59.203
What does he drink?

33:59.205 --> 34:01.873
What? You mean like a version
of candy and flowers?

34:01.875 --> 34:03.207
What do you mean?

34:03.209 --> 34:04.709
You can't apologize like that.

34:04.711 --> 34:05.576
I can't?

34:05.578 --> 34:06.844
Not between men.

34:06.846 --> 34:08.112
Not in something like this.

34:08.114 --> 34:09.514
What then?

34:09.516 --> 34:13.518
You ask him to do you a favor,
a favor that would flatter him.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.453
How is that an apology?

34:15.455 --> 34:17.121
You show the respect
that you didn't show

34:17.123 --> 34:19.690
when you did the thing
you want to apologize for.

34:19.693 --> 34:22.927
Nobody gets all mushy,
nobody has to hug it out.

34:22.929 --> 34:25.129
Trust me on this.

34:44.882 --> 34:46.617
How did you know?

34:46.619 --> 34:49.554
Does it matter?

34:52.725 --> 34:55.092
It's not what it looks like.

34:56.395 --> 34:57.929
We're friends.

34:59.398 --> 35:04.168
Yeah. Uh, we're probably
a little bit too close, but...

35:04.170 --> 35:06.637
we never really crossed
the line.

35:06.639 --> 35:08.272
Well, we're happy

35:08.274 --> 35:12.577
to hear that, but I'm not sure
Richard would see it that way.

35:12.579 --> 35:14.378
You don't understand.

35:15.347 --> 35:18.783
You don't know
what it's been like.

35:18.785 --> 35:21.185
I am a good wife.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.622
You know how long I went

35:24.624 --> 35:28.526
without a single loving touch?

35:30.129 --> 35:31.929
We're not here to judge you.

35:31.931 --> 35:33.531
No, no.

35:33.533 --> 35:36.467
You're here to flip me,
to use those against me.

35:36.469 --> 35:38.402
No, we're here to help you.

35:38.404 --> 35:40.838
Yes, some help you are.

35:40.840 --> 35:43.374
My husband gave
everything

35:43.376 --> 35:45.943
for his country,
and he got nothing in return.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.547
He's hanging by a string,

35:49.549 --> 35:51.582
and now my choice

35:51.584 --> 35:55.253
is to either destroy
the man I love

35:55.255 --> 35:57.955
with these pictures,

35:57.957 --> 35:59.957
or send myself

35:59.959 --> 36:02.760
to jail, and in the process,

36:02.762 --> 36:05.530
strip him of any chance
of getting better.

36:11.937 --> 36:14.071
What's this?

36:14.073 --> 36:16.307
I got a friend
in the Department of Defense.

36:16.309 --> 36:18.509
They cut through
some red tape.

36:27.352 --> 36:29.253
The V.A. authorized treatment
for your husband.

36:29.255 --> 36:32.256
He checks in Tuesday.

36:32.258 --> 36:34.325
It's fully covered.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.795
And I go to jail?

36:40.933 --> 36:44.001
Choice is yours.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.375
He's coming home.

37:06.258 --> 37:08.125
What's going on?

37:08.994 --> 37:10.728
Richard.

37:10.730 --> 37:12.964
Wh-What's wrong?

37:12.966 --> 37:15.499
Uh, you've, uh, met
these detectives already?

37:15.501 --> 37:17.501
Yeah, they came around

37:17.503 --> 37:19.904
asking about break-ins
in the neighborhood.

37:20.806 --> 37:22.940
Yeah, that's not
why they were here.

37:22.942 --> 37:26.510
Yeah, I'm starting to get that.

37:27.880 --> 37:30.514
So what is it?

37:48.100 --> 37:50.134
Any news?

37:50.136 --> 37:51.869
Sure, come right in, Danny.

37:51.871 --> 37:53.471
Thank you. Have you
heard anything?

37:53.473 --> 37:55.072
Yes, I just spoke to the D.A.

37:55.074 --> 37:56.173
And?

37:56.175 --> 37:58.943
They will each get
five years apiece.

37:58.945 --> 38:01.112
Yes! Great.

38:01.114 --> 38:03.014
Gave them a nickel
when they could have got a dime.

38:03.016 --> 38:04.348
First-time offenders.

38:04.350 --> 38:06.050
D.A. thought
five years was enough

38:06.052 --> 38:07.485
to knock some sense into them.

38:07.487 --> 38:08.619
Thanks to you.

38:08.621 --> 38:10.388
I owe you big-time
on this one, sis.

38:10.390 --> 38:13.457
You would only owe me
if I wasn't doing my job,

38:13.459 --> 38:15.826
but that's all I was doing.
Hmm.

38:15.828 --> 38:18.529
Right. How's things
with you and Holbrooke?

38:18.531 --> 38:20.698
Shut up.

38:23.335 --> 38:25.369
Yes!

38:25.371 --> 38:27.004
All right. All right.
Thank you. Thank you.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.341
Come on in.

38:30.343 --> 38:31.943
Good news?

38:31.945 --> 38:33.744
They got him!

38:33.746 --> 38:37.214
Our guys just grabbed
one Ned Tobolowsky, aka Spanky,

38:37.216 --> 38:39.183
trying to board
a flight to the U.K.

38:39.185 --> 38:40.384
They're bringing him in now.

38:40.386 --> 38:41.886
Congratulations.

38:41.888 --> 38:46.190
Thank you, and, uh,
my, uh, condolences to you.

38:46.192 --> 38:47.491
No, that's not...
that's not right.

38:47.493 --> 38:49.660
You want me
to get you his autograph?

38:49.662 --> 38:50.662
No.

38:50.663 --> 38:52.596
Or I could take you
down to booking,

38:52.598 --> 38:55.032
get one of those selfies with
him for your Instamatic page.

38:55.034 --> 38:56.467
You mean Instagram?

38:56.469 --> 38:58.536
Yeah, that one.
I don't have one.

38:58.538 --> 38:59.737
Oh.
Hey, we got him!

38:59.739 --> 39:01.005
Oh, yeah,
I just heard!

39:01.007 --> 39:03.507
I was just talking to Garrett
about getting a picture

39:03.509 --> 39:05.309
with him and Spanky.

39:05.311 --> 39:07.244
It would make a great
Christmas card.

39:10.183 --> 39:11.916
I'm kidding you.
I'm kidding you.

39:11.918 --> 39:13.150
You needed me?

39:13.152 --> 39:14.885
Uh, no, it can wait.

39:14.887 --> 39:17.321
You guys celebrate.
No, no, no. Come on, shoot.

39:17.323 --> 39:19.590
Well, I wanted
to ask you a favor.

39:19.592 --> 39:22.593
Okay.

39:22.595 --> 39:26.364
The John Jay School of Criminal
Justice-- they asked us

39:26.366 --> 39:27.665
for a speaker

39:27.667 --> 39:31.469
for their International
Urban Policing Symposium.

39:31.471 --> 39:34.372
And you want me?

39:34.374 --> 39:38.309
Well, they got a lot
of kind of...

39:39.911 --> 39:42.480
...egghead types
already signed up.

39:42.482 --> 39:46.484
Figured they could use
a real smart cop, a cop's cop.

39:46.486 --> 39:49.320
And you thought of me?

39:49.322 --> 39:51.889
Yeah, I thought of you.

39:54.426 --> 39:57.628
Hey, it's his call, Sid.

39:59.064 --> 40:01.098
Thank you, Garrett.

40:01.100 --> 40:03.267
I'd be glad to do that.

40:14.813 --> 40:17.782
You know
I don't like long good-byes.

40:17.784 --> 40:20.217
I just want to make sure
you get settled in okay.

40:20.219 --> 40:23.020
You've already done
more than enough.

40:23.022 --> 40:25.589
Then you can thank me
by letting me do this.

40:25.591 --> 40:26.957
Trust me, Richard.

40:26.959 --> 40:28.526
If she's anything
like my wife,

40:28.528 --> 40:29.827
just give it up now.

40:29.829 --> 40:31.495
Checking in?

40:31.497 --> 40:32.763
Name?

40:32.765 --> 40:35.633
Uh, Richard, uh...

40:39.404 --> 40:43.340
This is Captain Richard Sullivan
of the Sixth

40:43.342 --> 40:47.812
Stryker Brigade Combat Team,
Ninth Infantry Division.

40:47.814 --> 40:50.848
Please escort Captain Sullivan
to his room.

41:04.062 --> 41:06.163
I love you.

41:06.165 --> 41:08.699
And when we both get out,

41:08.701 --> 41:11.135
this is gonna be better.

41:37.662 --> 41:39.864
Good luck.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.035
Oorah.

41:45.037 --> 41:47.338
Oorah.

42:17.769 --> 42:19.970
I don't know what to say.

42:21.706 --> 42:24.608
Just say you'll
never do it again.

42:24.610 --> 42:27.011
Never.

42:27.013 --> 42:29.580
Good.

42:32.984 --> 42:34.952
And thank you.

42:34.954 --> 42:37.955
Thank you?

42:37.957 --> 42:39.957
Well, that is a first.

42:45.519 --> 42:47.420
Let's go.
