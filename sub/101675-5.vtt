WEBVTT

00:02.050 --> 00:03.056
All right, let me start

00:03.058 --> 00:05.089
by saying that I owe you an apology.

00:05.091 --> 00:08.009
I want you to know that
I'm trying to change.

00:08.010 --> 00:09.274
What do you want from me?

00:09.276 --> 00:10.720
One more chance.

00:10.722 --> 00:12.970
Thanks again for giving me another shot.

00:12.972 --> 00:15.915
Well, I'm trying to get
better at forgiving people.

00:15.917 --> 00:17.423
Well, I'm glad to hear you say that,

00:17.425 --> 00:19.646
'cause I'm the one who
egged your store last night.

00:19.648 --> 00:22.217
Hmm, forgiving people sucks.

00:22.219 --> 00:23.525
Should we say grace?

00:23.527 --> 00:24.814
Heck yeah!

00:24.816 --> 00:27.429
Oh, cool, let's say grace.

00:27.431 --> 00:28.431
Well?

00:28.433 --> 00:29.826
It's very...

00:29.828 --> 00:31.228
colorful.

00:31.230 --> 00:33.014
Check out the best part.

00:36.315 --> 00:38.274
Want to try it out?

00:39.665 --> 00:41.407
As long as I can remember,

00:41.409 --> 00:44.825
unlocking the mechanisms that
govern the physical universe

00:44.827 --> 00:46.907
was my greatest passion.

00:46.909 --> 00:49.939
- Whatcha workin' on?
- Dungeons & Dragons.

00:49.941 --> 00:51.095
Hey, even Hawking took

00:51.097 --> 00:52.939
a roll through the park once in a while.

00:52.941 --> 00:55.689
I'm working on a new campaign
to play with Tam and Billy.

00:55.691 --> 00:57.650
You know how I feel about that game.

00:57.652 --> 00:59.742
I'm aware, which is why
the most wicked thing

00:59.744 --> 01:01.406
in it is my sense of humor.

01:02.464 --> 01:05.077
I still don't like it.

01:05.078 --> 01:08.556
But you are playing with other
kids, so I'll take it as a win.

01:08.558 --> 01:10.691
Not just playing with other kids,

01:10.693 --> 01:12.913
controlling every aspect

01:12.915 --> 01:16.642
of their destiny as their
Dungeon Master overlord.

01:16.644 --> 01:19.469
I didn't believe in God but
I sure loved acting like one.

01:20.558 --> 01:21.861
Hey, Mary.

01:21.863 --> 01:24.126
Wayne, come on in. Thank you.

01:24.129 --> 01:26.517
George just ran to pick up some beers.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.042
It's funny when he runs, ain't it?

01:28.044 --> 01:29.565
Oh, hey, Darlene wanted

01:29.567 --> 01:31.766
to know if you were gonna
packanything nice to wear.

01:31.769 --> 01:32.960
For what?

01:32.962 --> 01:34.788
The coaches conference.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.125
I wasn't going to that.

01:36.128 --> 01:37.432
Darlene's going?

01:37.435 --> 01:39.182
A free weekend in San Antonio?

01:39.185 --> 01:40.547
Hotel on the river?

01:40.550 --> 01:41.838
Of course she's going.

01:41.840 --> 01:42.836
Oh.

01:42.839 --> 01:44.405
Did George not invite you?

01:44.408 --> 01:46.617
No, he didn't.

01:46.620 --> 01:49.627
Honestly, what is wrong with that man?

01:49.630 --> 01:51.067
Game time!

01:53.522 --> 01:54.999
What?

01:55.002 --> 01:57.723
Mom's just mad I'm
playing Dungeons & Dragons.

01:57.726 --> 01:59.118
Oh, good.

02:19.765 --> 02:22.024
I didn't know
he was bringing his wife.

02:22.027 --> 02:25.204
And of course it didn't
even occur to you to ask me?

02:25.207 --> 02:27.235
Well, no, but isn't that better

02:27.238 --> 02:29.455
than thinking about it
and then not doing it?

02:29.458 --> 02:31.146
They both make you a jerk.

02:31.149 --> 02:32.950
Since when are you interested

02:32.952 --> 02:34.648
in a coaches conference?

02:34.650 --> 02:36.633
I am interested in a weekend

02:36.636 --> 02:39.521
at a nice hotel by a river.

02:39.524 --> 02:41.570
Hotel is pretty nice.

02:44.224 --> 02:45.615
What's up?

02:45.617 --> 02:47.051
Watching the game with your dad.

02:47.053 --> 02:48.052
Where is he?

02:48.054 --> 02:50.402
Getting yelled at by your mom.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.797
Cool.

02:54.104 --> 02:56.680
Any chance you might want to
watch the kids this weekend?

02:56.683 --> 02:58.849
- Sure, no problem.
- Good.

02:58.852 --> 03:00.891
I thought you and Dalemight have plans.

03:00.893 --> 03:03.024
We might hang out, but...

03:03.026 --> 03:04.634
it's fine.

03:04.636 --> 03:06.114
Something going on?

03:06.116 --> 03:07.942
Mm-mm.

03:07.944 --> 03:10.118
Sounds like something.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.642
Well...

03:12.644 --> 03:16.603
he's trying to be a
better person, and...

03:16.605 --> 03:18.039
it's weird.

03:18.041 --> 03:19.040
Weird how?

03:19.042 --> 03:20.955
Just doesn't seem natural.

03:20.957 --> 03:22.957
I don't follow.

03:22.959 --> 03:26.003
Like when you see a
dancing bear at the circus,

03:26.005 --> 03:30.094
and you know it just wants
to rip some clown's head off.

03:30.096 --> 03:32.575
That's graphic.

03:32.577 --> 03:34.272
Where are y'all going?

03:34.274 --> 03:36.753
George has a coaches
conferencein San Antonio.

03:36.755 --> 03:39.165
Oh, and you weaseled
your way in? Good for you.

03:39.168 --> 03:40.322
I didn't weasel.

03:40.324 --> 03:41.845
So it was his idea?

03:41.847 --> 03:43.325
Not exactly.

03:43.327 --> 03:46.807
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a weasel.

03:48.419 --> 03:50.680
Congratulations.

03:58.035 --> 03:59.341
Getting ready for your trip?

03:59.343 --> 04:00.519
Yep.

04:00.522 --> 04:02.173
Dale told me you're taking his camper.

04:02.176 --> 04:04.738
Yeah. We're gonna head down
with Wayne and his wife.

04:04.740 --> 04:05.915
Cool.

04:07.525 --> 04:09.177
Just out of curiosity,

04:09.179 --> 04:11.179
when exactly are you and Mom leaving,

04:11.181 --> 04:13.272
and when exactly are y'all coming back?

04:13.275 --> 04:15.101
You're not bringing
your girlfriend here.

04:15.104 --> 04:18.236
Excuse me for taking an
interest in your life.

04:18.238 --> 04:20.320
Besides, your grandma'll
be here the whole time.

04:21.253 --> 04:23.146
Never mind.

04:23.149 --> 04:24.758
Wait.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.639
So her house'll be empty?

04:26.642 --> 04:28.464
Look, I used to be your age,

04:28.467 --> 04:30.894
but can you try thinking
with your brain for once?

04:30.897 --> 04:32.015
If you used to be my age,

04:32.018 --> 04:33.581
I think you know the answer to that.

04:36.641 --> 04:39.163
All right, baby,

04:39.165 --> 04:40.944
we're leaving here in a few minutes,

04:40.947 --> 04:44.241
but we'll be back on Sunday
and your meemaw'll be here.

04:46.346 --> 04:47.911
Sheldon?

04:47.913 --> 04:49.347
What?

04:49.349 --> 04:50.653
We're leaving.

04:50.655 --> 04:52.399
Where are you going?

04:52.402 --> 04:54.793
To San Antonio.

04:54.796 --> 04:56.358
When are you leaving?

04:56.361 --> 04:57.491
In a few minutes.

04:57.494 --> 04:58.797
When will you get back?

04:58.800 --> 05:01.358
- Sunday.
- But who's going to watch us?

05:01.361 --> 05:02.858
Meemaw.

05:02.861 --> 05:04.274
Okay. Bye.

05:04.277 --> 05:06.453
Can you at least give me a hug?

05:08.064 --> 05:09.892
I can.

05:11.857 --> 05:13.931
Hey. Just finishing up.

05:15.289 --> 05:16.600
See you again soon.

05:17.638 --> 05:19.290
How you doing?

05:19.292 --> 05:21.684
All right, I guess.

05:21.686 --> 05:23.272
Uh, Dale here?

05:23.275 --> 05:25.663
He went to go hang out with
my meemaw, who, by the way,

05:25.666 --> 05:27.725
is at my house all
weekend, so that's a no-go.

05:27.728 --> 05:28.874
Okay.

05:28.877 --> 05:30.399
What do you want to do later?

05:30.402 --> 05:32.619
Movies? Putt-putt?

05:32.622 --> 05:35.218
I was thinking maybe
we could go get a test.

05:35.221 --> 05:37.004
What kind of test?

05:37.006 --> 05:39.530
The... pregnancy kind.

05:40.755 --> 05:42.748
We're closed.

05:42.751 --> 05:44.098
But the sign says...

05:44.100 --> 05:46.276
We're closed!

05:50.566 --> 05:52.473
This can't be happening.
How sure are you?

05:52.475 --> 05:54.406
I'm not sure. That's why
I want to get the test.

05:54.409 --> 05:55.911
Well, you don't look pregnant.

05:55.914 --> 05:57.914
That's not how it works, Georgie.

05:57.917 --> 06:00.734
I know. I'm just freaking out right now.

06:00.737 --> 06:03.175
- Let's just go to the drugstore.
- Right.

06:03.178 --> 06:04.656
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

06:04.659 --> 06:06.182
Please don't say that.

06:06.184 --> 06:08.289
So you've stayed at this hotel before?

06:08.292 --> 06:09.664
Oh, yeah. It's nice.

06:09.666 --> 06:13.265
They got an indoor pool and
a killer breakfast buffet.

06:13.268 --> 06:15.660
There's even a real nice
gym we'll walk right past

06:15.663 --> 06:17.214
on the way to the breakfast buffet.

06:17.217 --> 06:18.912
Why didn't you tell me there was a pool?

06:18.915 --> 06:20.472
I would've brought my bathing suit.

06:20.475 --> 06:23.302
Hotels have pools... didn't
think I needed to mention it.

06:23.305 --> 06:25.542
Well, it would have
been nice if you did.

06:25.545 --> 06:27.058
They also have beds in the rooms.

06:27.061 --> 06:28.519
Did you remember your pajamas?

06:28.522 --> 06:30.034
Okay, you don't have to act

06:30.037 --> 06:31.738
- like that.
- Well, you don't need to blame me

06:31.740 --> 06:33.214
'cause you forgot your bathing suit.

06:33.217 --> 06:35.237
Well, I guess we're
not going in the pool.

06:36.878 --> 06:38.118
Maybe you're not.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.628
I packed my suit.

06:39.631 --> 06:42.409
Are you gonna behave
like this all weekend?

06:42.412 --> 06:44.107
What? Responsible and fun-loving?

06:44.110 --> 06:45.604
Probably.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.693
You are such a...

06:47.695 --> 06:49.695
monkey butt.

06:49.697 --> 06:52.011
Come on.

06:52.014 --> 06:54.214
There's got to be more
insulting name you can call me.

06:54.217 --> 06:56.304
I am sure there is, but
they're about to get in

06:56.307 --> 06:58.097
and they do not need to hear us arguing.

06:58.100 --> 07:01.841
Whoo-wee! Ha-ha! Hey, Mary.

07:01.844 --> 07:03.926
- Darlene, good to see you.
- Oh, hey.

07:03.928 --> 07:05.245
George, how's it going?

07:05.248 --> 07:07.799
Good, good. We were
definitely not arguing

07:07.802 --> 07:09.745
ten seconds ago.

07:12.679 --> 07:14.799
I figured we'd order pizza.

07:14.802 --> 07:15.801
Okay.

07:15.804 --> 07:17.891
What do you want on it?

07:17.894 --> 07:20.638
Everything except onions,

07:20.641 --> 07:22.902
green peppers, mushrooms,

07:22.905 --> 07:25.294
- spinach...
- No vegetables. Got it.

07:25.297 --> 07:27.167
How about a little salad, too?

07:27.169 --> 07:28.603
If you like wasting money.

07:28.605 --> 07:30.692
Spoken like a true Texan.

07:30.694 --> 07:32.607
So what's Sheldon like?

07:32.609 --> 07:33.862
A pain in the ass.

07:33.865 --> 07:37.345
No, he means, what does
Sheldon like on his pizza?

07:37.348 --> 07:39.003
Oh.

07:39.006 --> 07:41.746
Sheldon! What do you
want on your pizza!?

07:41.749 --> 07:43.003
Still glad you came?

07:43.006 --> 07:44.441
Actually, I am.

07:44.444 --> 07:46.487
I don't want any pizza.

07:46.490 --> 07:48.359
See? Pain in the ass.

07:48.362 --> 07:50.493
Well, we can get something else.

07:50.496 --> 07:52.409
I don't want anything. I'm not hungry.

07:52.412 --> 07:53.846
Well, what's the matter?

07:53.848 --> 07:55.412
My friends were supposed to play

07:55.414 --> 07:56.805
Dungeons & Dragons with me,

07:56.807 --> 07:58.120
but they cancelled.

07:58.123 --> 07:59.981
Aw. Sorry.

07:59.984 --> 08:01.680
We can play it with you.

08:01.682 --> 08:02.942
Really?

08:02.944 --> 08:05.081
Dale, that's nice, but...

08:05.084 --> 08:06.693
I don't think you'll like it.

08:06.696 --> 08:08.034
Afraid I might beat you?

08:08.037 --> 08:10.573
Actually, there's no one
winner. It's a cooperative game

08:10.576 --> 08:13.534
where you use your imagination
to explore a fantasy world

08:13.537 --> 08:16.128
with the help of the Dungeon
Master's preplanned scenarios

08:16.131 --> 08:19.480
and the rolling of polyhedral dice.

08:19.482 --> 08:21.090
Still sound fun?

08:21.092 --> 08:22.788
Yeah.

08:22.790 --> 08:23.965
Sorta.

08:30.167 --> 08:31.620
I got it.

08:31.623 --> 08:33.667
- Anybody see you?
- No. And I didn't

08:33.669 --> 08:35.277
recognize the guy behind the counter,

08:35.280 --> 08:37.605
but I used an Italian
accent just in case.

08:37.607 --> 08:39.259
Please tell me you're joking.

08:39.261 --> 08:41.393
Oh, I'm-a no joking.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.048
Oh, God.

08:43.051 --> 08:45.244
- Here. Do it.
- I can't do it here.

08:45.247 --> 08:46.768
I have to pee on it.

08:46.770 --> 08:48.862
Okay, fine.

08:48.865 --> 08:51.206
Although we've done
crazier stuff in this truck.

08:52.334 --> 08:54.245
Oh, by the way, I made
reservations tonight

08:54.248 --> 08:56.292
at that, uh, steakhouse
on the Riverwalk.

08:56.295 --> 08:58.167
- Ooh, fancy.
- Well, yeah.

08:58.170 --> 09:01.303
Nothing says fancy like
a two-pound slab of meat.

09:01.306 --> 09:02.915
Oh, shoot.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.402
I didn't pack my dress shoes.

09:04.405 --> 09:06.034
See, George? It might be helpful

09:06.037 --> 09:08.112
if you mentioned some of
these things ahead of time.

09:08.115 --> 09:11.139
- Here we go.
- Wayne's always doing stuff like this.

09:11.142 --> 09:12.917
I'm glad to know it's not just us.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.181
That's why I packed
his shoes last night.

09:15.184 --> 09:18.636
You did? Baby, you're the best.

09:18.639 --> 09:20.964
Well, how can I be
the best when you are?

09:21.969 --> 09:23.536
It is just us.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.652
So, how does this work?

09:26.655 --> 09:28.568
You start by creating your character.

09:28.571 --> 09:31.347
I want to be a Ninja
Turtle Princess of Power.

09:31.350 --> 09:33.566
Put me down for that, too.

09:33.569 --> 09:35.808
You have to choose from one
of the character classes.

09:35.811 --> 09:37.933
There's thief, druid, paladin, wizard...

09:37.936 --> 09:40.550
- Ooh, wizard. I want that.
- All right.

09:40.553 --> 09:41.987
Then I'll use my magic to turn me

09:41.990 --> 09:44.164
into a Ninja Turtle Princess of Power.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.284
No.

09:45.287 --> 09:47.461
W-Wh... Wait a minute. What's a paladin?

09:47.464 --> 09:50.605
A paladin is a holy knight who
crusades in the name of good.

09:50.608 --> 09:52.042
Oh, I like that.

09:52.045 --> 09:53.393
I want to be that.

09:53.396 --> 09:55.662
- Really?
- Yeah, I've been meaning

09:55.665 --> 09:57.972
to do more crusading
in the name of good.

09:58.929 --> 10:00.495
Okay.

10:00.498 --> 10:02.759
You say you got thief on that list?

10:02.762 --> 10:04.050
I'll be a thief.

10:05.043 --> 10:07.019
That sounds like fun.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.328
Okay, I think I got it.

10:09.331 --> 10:11.230
It takes ten minutes for the results.

10:11.233 --> 10:12.537
You want me to go in with you?

10:12.540 --> 10:13.800
To watch me pee on a stick?

10:13.803 --> 10:15.020
I'm being supportive right now.

10:15.022 --> 10:16.292
You could try the same.

10:30.700 --> 10:32.656
I'm pregnant. You
sure I'm not too heavy?

10:32.658 --> 10:34.051
No, I got it.

10:35.585 --> 10:37.501
I guess it's time to do what people do

10:37.504 --> 10:38.634
on their wedding night.

10:38.637 --> 10:40.682
Georgie, we're gonna be parents.

10:40.685 --> 10:41.858
We don't do that anymore.

10:41.861 --> 10:43.493
Oh, right.

10:43.495 --> 10:46.423
Besides, my water just
broke all over your bed.

10:46.426 --> 10:47.773
Dadgum it.

10:49.270 --> 10:51.575
Stop having fun, and help
me take care of these babies.

10:51.578 --> 10:54.100
But I just got home from my day job.

10:54.103 --> 10:56.087
And I only have ten
minutes till my night job.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.659
That's ten minutes you could be helping.

10:57.661 --> 10:59.922
Now go change whichever this one is.

11:02.123 --> 11:03.142
Georgie,

11:03.145 --> 11:06.124
there's a band called
Guns N' Roses on the phone.

11:06.127 --> 11:07.673
Really?

11:07.676 --> 11:09.997
Yeah. The guitarist hurt his hand,

11:10.000 --> 11:11.741
and they want you to fill in.

11:14.296 --> 11:16.775
Tell them I can't. I'm a dad now.

11:16.778 --> 11:18.257
Okay.

11:20.933 --> 11:23.326
This is a long ten minutes.

11:29.948 --> 11:32.503
Ooh, this camper is so cool.

11:32.506 --> 11:34.729
We borrowed it from my mom's boyfriend.

11:34.732 --> 11:37.080
Yeah, you might not want
to poke around too much.

11:37.083 --> 11:39.839
You find my mother-in-law's bra,
I'm driving into a brick wall.

11:40.936 --> 11:42.263
Maybe we get one of these.

11:42.266 --> 11:43.371
Spend our summers

11:43.374 --> 11:44.972
driving around, just the two of us.

11:44.975 --> 11:47.690
That sounds amazing.
Where would we go first?

11:47.693 --> 11:48.731
Does it even matter?

11:48.732 --> 11:50.706
We don't even have to
take it out the driveway.

11:50.708 --> 11:52.753
You got that right.

11:52.756 --> 11:55.148
- Can you guys not do that?
- Do what?

11:55.151 --> 11:58.154
Be so happy. You're
married. Act like it.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.717
How do you put up with him?

12:01.719 --> 12:04.222
That's a good question.
What's your secret?

12:04.225 --> 12:06.616
Communication.

12:06.619 --> 12:08.089
Oh, God.

12:13.046 --> 12:15.556
- Well?
- I'm not.

12:15.559 --> 12:18.299
- Really?
- We're good.

12:18.301 --> 12:20.216
Oh, thank God.

12:23.532 --> 12:26.306
- What a relief.
- I know.

12:26.309 --> 12:28.128
We better stop hugging,

12:28.131 --> 12:30.506
or you're gonna need
another stick to pee on.

12:31.232 --> 12:33.798
You enter a dark and musty crypt.

12:33.801 --> 12:36.316
Torches along the walls fill the room

12:36.319 --> 12:37.894
with a flickering light.

12:37.897 --> 12:41.440
In the center of the room is
a mysterious glowing chest.

12:41.443 --> 12:42.784
What do you do?

12:42.787 --> 12:44.003
I open the chest.

12:44.006 --> 12:45.934
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:45.937 --> 12:47.979
It's a chest in the middle of a crypt.

12:47.982 --> 12:49.804
That's a little
suspicious, don't you think?

12:49.807 --> 12:52.375
I don't know. I'm not
even sure what a crypt is.

12:52.378 --> 12:53.526
Aah!

12:53.529 --> 12:55.190
It could be booby-trapped.

12:55.193 --> 12:58.020
Thieves have the
ability to check for traps.

12:58.023 --> 12:59.925
Good for me, I can do that.

12:59.928 --> 13:04.082
Hold it. This chest
does not belong to us.

13:04.085 --> 13:05.878
So?

13:05.881 --> 13:07.503
I'm a paladin.

13:07.506 --> 13:10.933
It's not a very... paladin-y thing to do.

13:10.936 --> 13:12.544
You didn't want to steal the key,

13:12.547 --> 13:14.136
You didn't want to fight the goblins.

13:14.139 --> 13:15.972
You wouldn't even kill the spider.

13:15.975 --> 13:18.261
You put it in a cup and took it outside.

13:18.264 --> 13:19.487
Well, that wasn't in the game.

13:19.490 --> 13:20.683
I know.

13:20.686 --> 13:23.493
It was in real life, which is worse.

13:23.496 --> 13:26.823
Could me and your meemaw
have a little privacy, please?

13:26.826 --> 13:29.066
We can leave,
but we're still gonna listen.

13:29.068 --> 13:30.815
Also, you find no traps.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.698
What is your problem?

13:34.701 --> 13:36.570
You act like Mr. Goody Two-shoes,

13:36.573 --> 13:38.628
and you expect meto believe that's real?

13:38.631 --> 13:40.859
- Yeah.
- Well, I don't.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.253
Sheldon said there were no traps.

13:44.662 --> 13:47.228
Now, I know it's hokey,
but at least once a day,

13:47.231 --> 13:50.972
Darlene and I say one thing that
we appreciate about each other.

13:50.975 --> 13:52.972
Isn't that sweet?

13:52.975 --> 13:54.503
It was Wayne's idea.

13:54.506 --> 13:56.761
I appreciate you saying that.

13:56.764 --> 13:58.139
And I'm gonna vomit.

13:59.750 --> 14:01.576
It's fine.

14:01.578 --> 14:03.404
We-we know we appreciate each other.

14:03.406 --> 14:06.145
Mary, is it fine?

14:06.147 --> 14:08.558
I guess it wouldn't hurt

14:08.561 --> 14:10.411
to hear it once in a while.

14:10.413 --> 14:12.456
George?

14:12.458 --> 14:14.753
What? Now?

14:14.756 --> 14:16.147
You got something better to do?

14:16.150 --> 14:17.487
Come on, George.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.881
This is ridiculous.

14:18.884 --> 14:20.479
Just do it, you baby.

14:23.382 --> 14:27.097
Fine. Mary, I appreciate you.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.921
That's the best you can do?

14:28.924 --> 14:32.784
Baby, you have any single
friends for this poor woman?

14:35.240 --> 14:39.104
Mary, I appreciate how much
you take care of the house

14:39.107 --> 14:42.238
and... all of us.

14:42.241 --> 14:44.417
I know it's not easy.

14:46.506 --> 14:49.261
Thank you. That means a lot.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.433
I love it. Mary, you're up.

14:54.381 --> 14:56.300
Well, George...

14:58.461 --> 15:02.019
I appreciate how hard you work.

15:02.022 --> 15:05.253
I know you make a lot
of sacrifices for us,

15:05.256 --> 15:08.041
and you don't get
enough credit for that.

15:12.394 --> 15:14.222
Thank you.

15:19.324 --> 15:21.276
Now, let's hear how
much you appreciate me

15:21.279 --> 15:23.062
for fixing your marriage.

15:23.065 --> 15:25.023
Shut up, Wayne.

15:27.114 --> 15:29.097
I wonder who came up
with blue raspberry.

15:29.100 --> 15:30.495
Raspberries ain't blue.

15:30.498 --> 15:33.064
- It should be blueberry.
- You'd think.

15:33.067 --> 15:36.620
But blueberries ain't blue
either, they're purple.

15:36.623 --> 15:39.940
The whole blue food situation
in this country needs some work.

15:41.826 --> 15:43.173
So, what do you want to do?

15:43.176 --> 15:45.487
Probably something with our clothes on.

15:45.490 --> 15:47.331
No kidding. That was scary.

15:47.334 --> 15:48.745
- Terrifying.
- I was afraid

15:48.748 --> 15:50.472
I was gonna have to marry you.

15:50.475 --> 15:51.691
Afraid?

15:51.694 --> 15:53.564
Shaking in my boots.

15:53.567 --> 15:55.519
And what, exactly, would be so terrible

15:55.522 --> 15:57.342
about marrying me?

15:57.345 --> 16:00.026
I didn't say terrible.

16:00.029 --> 16:02.128
You can be afraid of
things that are great.

16:02.131 --> 16:03.827
Like what?

16:03.830 --> 16:06.026
Uh...

16:06.029 --> 16:08.291
Oh, roller coasters.

16:08.294 --> 16:09.979
You're an idiot.

16:09.982 --> 16:12.156
Roller coasters is a good answer.

16:12.159 --> 16:14.901
I didn't say sharks, which
is what I thought of first.

16:14.904 --> 16:16.338
You're making it worse.

16:16.341 --> 16:18.167
How is I worse? I didn't say it.

16:19.715 --> 16:21.846
Roller coasters is a good answer.

16:21.849 --> 16:24.893
What happened to you?
You used to be fun.

16:24.896 --> 16:26.519
Come on, I'm playing this stupid game

16:26.522 --> 16:28.479
- with your grandkids.
- That's rude.

16:28.482 --> 16:30.925
Cut the crap. We both
know this isn't you.

16:30.928 --> 16:32.449
Oh, I can't win with you.

16:32.452 --> 16:34.206
- What does that mean?
- Forget it.

16:34.209 --> 16:36.276
No, I'm not gonna forget it. Talk to me.

16:36.279 --> 16:38.659
- I don't want to.
- Missy, help me out here.

16:38.662 --> 16:40.401
Communication is important.

16:40.404 --> 16:42.706
- I learned that on the Fresh Princeshow.
- Oh...

16:45.241 --> 16:48.611
I asked you to marry me
and you turned me down flat.

16:48.614 --> 16:50.269
Are you still mad about that?

16:50.272 --> 16:52.351
Oh, hell yeah I'm still mad about that.

16:52.354 --> 16:53.500
He proposed?

16:53.503 --> 16:55.445
He just said he did. Pay attention.

16:55.447 --> 16:58.100
And you didn't even take it seriously.

16:58.102 --> 17:00.842
I didn't take it seriously
because you were drunk.

17:00.844 --> 17:02.406
That's when I'm the most honest.

17:02.409 --> 17:04.280
You can ask anybody at the bar.

17:04.281 --> 17:06.522
Okay, fine. That still
doesn't change the fact

17:06.526 --> 17:07.732
that I'm not interested

17:07.734 --> 17:09.508
- in getting married again.
- Why not?

17:09.511 --> 17:11.809
I don't have to explain myself to you.

17:11.810 --> 17:14.339
- I'd like to know.
- And I'd like to play D&D.

17:14.342 --> 17:16.383
We've been through this.

17:16.386 --> 17:18.555
I like my life just the way it is,

17:18.557 --> 17:22.150
and if you can't work
with that, then, well...

17:22.153 --> 17:23.979
Well what?

17:23.982 --> 17:26.416
Tough knuckles.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.897
Whoa.

17:27.901 --> 17:29.740
Huh.

17:29.742 --> 17:31.307
Well, that's good, then.

17:31.309 --> 17:32.787
I don't have to pretend to be

17:32.789 --> 17:35.311
mister water-drinking nice guy anymore.

17:35.313 --> 17:37.703
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

17:37.706 --> 17:41.012
Yeah, well.

17:41.014 --> 17:43.198
Will you all excuse me?

17:44.670 --> 17:45.843
Where you going?

17:45.845 --> 17:49.325
I'm gonna get myself a beer.

17:49.327 --> 17:52.467
So you're standing in a crypt
looking at a locked chest.

17:52.470 --> 17:53.711
What do you do?

17:53.714 --> 17:55.411
Pull a beer out of it.

17:59.397 --> 18:01.702
Get out of my way.

18:01.704 --> 18:05.053
I'm a thief, and I'm opening this chest.

18:05.055 --> 18:08.027
Have at it. I'm a
paladin with a buzz on.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.018
Success.

18:13.020 --> 18:14.889
The chest opens, revealing a scroll

18:14.891 --> 18:17.109
with ancient writing
in a strange language

18:17.111 --> 18:19.285
you don't recognize. What do you do?

18:19.287 --> 18:21.243
I say this is boring...

18:21.245 --> 18:24.161
and turn myself into a Ninja
Turtle Princess of Power.

18:28.292 --> 18:30.600
This game just got good.

18:30.602 --> 18:32.167
- High five.
- Yeah.
