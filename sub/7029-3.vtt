00:01.000 --> 00:02.500
Tonight on the curse of Oak Island

00:02.500 --> 00:05.670
I don't move some dirt wreck

00:05.770 --> 00:08.990
machine right there it's time to dig and

00:08.990 --> 00:12.019
you told me if you know where 30 rods to

00:12.019 --> 00:14.240
their lands right on that line x marks

00:14.240 --> 00:17.760
your spot that right there

00:17.760 --> 00:19.920
I claim this spot

00:19.920 --> 00:24.560
we're digging on Oak Island

00:24.560 --> 00:31.529
we can see something wait what's that

00:31.529 --> 00:35.000
there is an island in the North Atlantic

00:35.000 --> 00:36.730
where people have been looking for an

00:36.730 --> 00:39.620
incredible treasure for more than 200

00:39.620 --> 00:43.420
years so far they have found bits of

00:43.420 --> 00:47.020
gold chain a stone slab with strange

00:47.020 --> 00:50.690
symbols carved into it even a 17th

00:50.690 --> 00:54.270
century Spanish coin to date six men

00:54.270 --> 00:57.920
have died trying to solve the mystery

00:57.920 --> 01:01.480
and according to legend one more will

01:01.480 --> 01:07.690
have to die before the treasure can be

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074

01:20.890 --> 01:23.141
it is another day in the quest to find

01:23.141 --> 01:24.510
treasure on Oak Island

01:24.510 --> 01:31.229
here we me beat all this stuff and it's

01:31.229 --> 01:34.189
on this day that Rick and Marty lagina

01:34.189 --> 01:36.810
along with their partners have traveled

01:36.810 --> 01:39.320
almost 60 miles from Oak Island to

01:39.320 --> 01:42.790
Halifax in search of large-scale digging

01:42.790 --> 01:44.840
equipment everybody decide what they

01:44.840 --> 01:47.990
want to collect that little cat there

01:47.990 --> 01:48.990

02:19.940 --> 02:20.940
do it

02:20.940 --> 02:22.900
when we saw that equipment I think there

02:22.900 --> 02:25.280
were smiles on all our faces and yeah

02:25.280 --> 02:29.069
love to being new after spending 50

02:29.069 --> 02:33.000
years of dreaming decades of researching

02:33.000 --> 02:35.120
and the past two years actively

02:35.120 --> 02:38.120
identifying likely targets the Oak

02:38.120 --> 02:41.760
Island team is now ready to dig and dig

02:41.760 --> 02:44.620
deeper than ever before so here's one

02:44.620 --> 02:47.400
machine we're looking at right here wow

02:47.400 --> 02:48.930
that looks like plenty of machine my

02:48.930 --> 02:51.129
brother needs to step up to the plate on

02:51.129 --> 02:56.920
that I can work this thing

02:56.920 --> 02:58.500
Marty had all your remote monitoring

02:58.500 --> 03:00.350
these are the tracks right that's that's

03:00.350 --> 03:02.170
the controllers yeah and then a joystick

03:02.170 --> 03:05.099
control bucket curl on either side right

03:05.099 --> 03:07.450
and boom lift on the right so this is

03:07.450 --> 03:11.830
the boom down that'll be your curl okay

03:11.830 --> 03:15.630
I've got this we'll take it no this is

03:15.630 --> 03:17.300
fabulous this will do everything we need

03:17.300 --> 03:19.780
to do and probably more about can't wait

03:19.780 --> 03:21.970
to get it to the island and we're gonna

03:21.970 --> 03:23.760
use the big excavator to dig what do we

03:23.760 --> 03:27.400
want to dig this one here with the

03:27.400 --> 03:29.519
backhoe we can do with more fine-tuned

03:29.519 --> 03:32.209
digging where we might need to do that

03:32.209 --> 03:35.560
that looks comfy okay

03:35.560 --> 03:40.290
this is mine and then with the bulldozer

03:40.290 --> 03:42.090
Rick is a good bulldozer operator

03:42.090 --> 03:45.650
I don't move some dirt wreck Wow and we

03:45.650 --> 03:48.340
can use that to scrape off or level or

03:48.340 --> 03:50.879
whatever we need to get into any sites

03:50.879 --> 03:52.760
for future drilling yeah which is our

03:52.760 --> 03:55.959
little brother here the d4k these are

03:55.959 --> 03:58.739
beautiful machines yeah they're one you

03:58.739 --> 04:04.439
boys get up there take a look see eight

04:04.439 --> 04:07.370
there you go

04:07.370 --> 04:13.370
what I think Peter grandpa Ted loved

04:13.370 --> 04:16.190
running a bulldozer yeah he was never

04:16.190 --> 04:18.000
happier than when he was driving a

04:18.000 --> 04:23.860
bulldozer what give me started as Rick

04:23.860 --> 04:26.130
and Marty's youngest nephew Peter

04:26.130 --> 04:28.160
Fornetti has been steeped in the various

04:28.160 --> 04:30.940
legends and theories about Oak Island

04:30.940 --> 04:33.680
ever since he can remember he's wanted

04:33.680 --> 04:35.930
to considered by his family to be the

04:35.930 --> 04:38.400
one who most closely shears uncle Rick's

04:38.400 --> 04:41.580
passion for solving the 220 year old

04:41.580 --> 04:45.810
mystery okay so what do you guys think

04:45.810 --> 04:48.060
well here's the deal I've got strong

04:48.060 --> 04:50.320
opinions on the excavator backhoe side

04:50.320 --> 04:53.320
and he's kind of mr. dozer man so okay I

04:53.320 --> 04:55.090
think we'll take that big excavator the

04:55.090 --> 04:57.490
backhoe and that big dozer excellent

04:57.490 --> 05:00.360
okay yeah write it up deal we start

05:00.360 --> 05:05.830
moving some dirt around yeah

05:15.030 --> 05:16.030
okay

05:16.030 --> 05:18.060
okay Big Brother let's have a little fun

05:18.060 --> 05:19.970
as they await the delivery of the heavy

05:19.970 --> 05:23.430
digging equipment Rick and Marty lagina

05:23.430 --> 05:25.910
along with Craig tester stepson Jack

05:25.910 --> 05:28.080
Begley meet at the most infamous

05:28.080 --> 05:32.120
location on Oak Island the money pit hey

05:32.120 --> 05:35.600
Jack hey Marty hey Rick all right what

05:35.600 --> 05:37.300
we're gonna do we're gonna look for the

05:37.300 --> 05:39.600
x marks the spot from Robert Marcos

05:39.600 --> 05:43.250
let's go all right

05:43.250 --> 05:50.340
hey Robert good morning Gloria I'm Marty

05:50.340 --> 05:52.110
Marty pleasure yeah pleasure to finally

05:52.110 --> 05:54.230
have a seat while back home in Traverse

05:54.230 --> 05:57.229
City Michigan Marty lagina and business

05:57.229 --> 06:00.190
partner Alan Koh Strava arranged to meet

06:00.190 --> 06:02.479
with Oak Island theorists Robert Markus

06:02.479 --> 06:05.410
I want you to knock our socks off okay

06:05.410 --> 06:08.410
because my brother Alan Craig and I we

06:08.410 --> 06:10.240
really want to accomplish something this

06:10.240 --> 06:12.250
year it's time to dig and you told me

06:12.250 --> 06:14.030
you're gonna convince me that you know

06:14.030 --> 06:15.030
we're yes sir

06:15.030 --> 06:18.759
all right go for it based on his years

06:18.759 --> 06:21.570
of studying books maps and historical

06:21.570 --> 06:24.440
records his Marcus's belief that the

06:24.440 --> 06:27.050
lost treasures of King Solomon's Temple

06:27.050 --> 06:29.330
including the Ark of the Covenant were

06:29.330 --> 06:31.530
buried on Oak Island hundreds of years

06:31.530 --> 06:34.819
ago by the Knights Templar

06:34.819 --> 06:37.710
but while that in itself is not a new

06:37.710 --> 06:39.050
theory

06:39.050 --> 06:41.569
what makes Marcus's findings unique is

06:41.569 --> 06:43.669
that he believes the treasure lies

06:43.669 --> 06:46.330
buried not at the bottom of the money

06:46.330 --> 06:49.240
pit or the Oak Island swamp but at a

06:49.240 --> 06:53.120
very different location you know the

06:53.120 --> 06:54.729
history of Oak Island one of the

06:54.729 --> 06:57.479
characters is Gilbert Hedden yeah

06:57.479 --> 06:59.090
the thing about Gilbert which I really

06:59.090 --> 07:00.630
found interesting is he actually had

07:00.630 --> 07:03.190
something physical to look at and it was

07:03.190 --> 07:06.590
a math and it was Matt based out of a

07:06.590 --> 07:09.110
book written by Harold's Wilkins back in

07:09.110 --> 07:13.099
1935 and it was called Captain Kidd and

07:13.099 --> 07:16.830
his skeleton island in 1937

07:16.830 --> 07:19.280
industrialist politician and Oak Island

07:19.280 --> 07:21.910
treasure hunter Gilbert Hedden believed

07:21.910 --> 07:24.169
he had made a critical breakthrough when

07:24.169 --> 07:26.570
he saw a startling treasure map in the

07:26.570 --> 07:29.660
fictionalized account of real-life 17th

07:29.660 --> 07:33.910
century privateer Captain William Kidd

07:33.910 --> 07:35.729
this is the map that was in the book but

07:35.729 --> 07:37.650
as you can see one of the things that's

07:37.650 --> 07:41.509
strange is the reference to North okay

07:41.509 --> 07:45.740
North is upside down

07:45.740 --> 07:47.050
the text and everything is right side up

07:47.050 --> 07:49.570
but North is upside down and that's not

07:49.570 --> 07:51.419
the way we're taught to read a map the

07:51.419 --> 07:54.310
other thing is with the shape of the

07:54.310 --> 07:56.750
island itself this little Peninsula land

07:56.750 --> 07:58.789
that comes off the elephant's nose the

07:58.789 --> 08:02.919
elephant's nose if you look at your Oak

08:02.919 --> 08:03.919
Island

08:03.919 --> 08:05.550
there's your elephant's nose right there

08:05.550 --> 08:09.720
right and North is up so this would be

08:09.720 --> 08:12.280
like that if you're looking at now all

08:12.280 --> 08:15.310
the text is upside down right and North

08:15.310 --> 08:18.479
is up

08:18.479 --> 08:20.550
Gilbert Hatton was fascinated by the

08:20.550 --> 08:23.050
multiple similarities between the map

08:23.050 --> 08:26.810
and Oak Island such as the strange

08:26.810 --> 08:33.990
oblong shape stone markers a swamp and

08:33.990 --> 08:37.200
of course a treasure site indicated near

08:37.200 --> 08:39.720
the exact spot where the money pit was

08:39.720 --> 08:42.890
located

08:42.890 --> 08:45.000
excited by his findings Hedden traveled

08:45.000 --> 08:47.060
to England to meet with the author of

08:47.060 --> 08:48.060
the book

08:48.060 --> 08:51.850
Harold Wilkins but Wilkins insisted that

08:51.850 --> 08:54.490
the map was nothing more than a figment

08:54.490 --> 08:57.959
of his imagination disappointed and

08:57.959 --> 09:00.630
desperately short of money Hedden

09:00.630 --> 09:03.930
returned home and soon after abandoned

09:03.930 --> 09:07.600
his search for the treasure when he was

09:07.600 --> 09:09.720
first confronted on this mr. Wilkins

09:09.720 --> 09:11.769
said this is a rendition he had seen

09:11.769 --> 09:14.740
this map somewhere before so the

09:14.740 --> 09:16.260
question is what did he see

09:16.260 --> 09:19.880
I myself personally believe this map was

09:19.880 --> 09:21.600
actually created by the Zeno brothers

09:21.600 --> 09:23.780
and Henry Sinclair

09:23.780 --> 09:26.790
I believe this map was actually created

09:35.890 --> 09:40.010
by the Zeno brothers and Henry Sinclair

09:40.010 --> 09:42.620
Oak Island theorists Robert Marcus has

09:42.620 --> 09:45.540
just informed Marty lagina about the

09:45.540 --> 09:47.920
existence of a treasure map that was

09:47.920 --> 09:50.760
reprinted in a book about Captain Kidd

09:50.760 --> 09:53.820
back in the 1930s

09:53.820 --> 09:55.780
although the identity and location of

09:55.780 --> 09:58.550
the island in the book is unknown when

09:58.550 --> 10:01.230
turned upside down it bears striking

10:01.230 --> 10:04.620
similarities to Oak Island similarities

10:04.620 --> 10:07.279
which according to Robert Marcus are no

10:07.279 --> 10:11.110
coincidence it is his belief that the

10:11.110 --> 10:14.790
map was based upon one drawn by the 14th

10:14.790 --> 10:17.660
century Scottish Explorer Henry Sinclair

10:17.660 --> 10:19.790
along with his companions the Zeno

10:19.790 --> 10:22.320
brothers

10:22.320 --> 10:24.140
I know a little bit about this story

10:24.140 --> 10:27.370
they're Italian navigators right yes for

10:27.370 --> 10:29.420
centuries there have been many who

10:29.420 --> 10:32.100
believe that the Zeno brothers along

10:32.100 --> 10:34.329
with Sinclair traveling under the

10:34.329 --> 10:38.050
pseudonym seach Meany sailed as far west

10:38.050 --> 10:42.420
as Nova Scotia and as early as 1398

10:42.420 --> 10:44.790
nearly 100 years before Columbus

10:44.790 --> 10:48.640
according to legend once there

10:48.640 --> 10:50.500
they hid a vast religious treasure

10:50.500 --> 10:54.200
possibly the Ark of the Covenant and the

10:54.200 --> 10:56.760
golden menorah from the temple of King

10:56.760 --> 10:59.410
Solomon to ensure they would one day be

10:59.410 --> 11:00.940
able to find it again

11:00.940 --> 11:03.209
they created a map which was coated with

11:03.209 --> 11:07.680
a numeric key featuring the numbers 7 by

11:07.680 --> 11:12.980
8 by 4 I believe mr. Wilkins

11:12.980 --> 11:15.610
misinterpreted the 7

11:15.610 --> 11:20.120
there should be one by it by for workers

11:20.120 --> 11:22.260
and that is based on a stone that was

11:22.260 --> 11:26.070
found in Massachusetts this is called

11:26.070 --> 11:30.690
the boat stone located in Westford

11:30.690 --> 11:33.710
Massachusetts the so called boat stone

11:33.710 --> 11:36.240
has left researchers and historians

11:36.240 --> 11:41.029
baffled since its discovery in 1932 it

11:41.029 --> 11:44.120
is a round 2 foot in diameter stone on

11:44.120 --> 11:46.560
which can be found what are believed to

11:46.560 --> 11:49.510
be 14th century carvings of an ancient

11:49.510 --> 11:54.589
sailing vessel an arrow and the numbers

11:54.589 --> 11:56.570
one eight four

11:56.570 --> 12:00.940
could this map really be an important

12:00.940 --> 12:04.121
link between the boat stone and the 14th

12:04.121 --> 12:08.660
century Scottish nobleman Henry Sinclair

12:08.660 --> 12:12.320
this is the starting point okay the boat

12:12.320 --> 12:15.660
represents a coastal range followed the

12:15.660 --> 12:18.260
coast in the number a hundred and eighty

12:18.260 --> 12:20.720
for the unit of measure back then was

12:20.720 --> 12:24.160
called a league now one hundred eighty

12:24.160 --> 12:27.100
four leagues north takes you to Overton

12:27.100 --> 12:30.959
Nova Scotia when you get to there you

12:30.959 --> 12:34.430
find the stone within the stone right

12:34.430 --> 12:37.180
here you have a depiction of the circle

12:37.180 --> 12:39.230
with the Templars cross in it I believe

12:39.230 --> 12:40.420
the Templars have carved this now

12:40.420 --> 12:45.670
looking in the directions you have a

12:45.670 --> 12:48.490
northeast quadrant from that stone to

12:48.490 --> 12:50.920
travel north east takes you to the south

12:50.920 --> 12:54.870
end of Mahone Bay and at that you find

12:54.870 --> 12:58.620
this right here this giant boulder and

12:58.620 --> 13:00.339
if you're looking at this stone that's

13:00.339 --> 13:01.339
my home Bay

13:01.339 --> 13:03.430
okay yeah so you're looking at my home

13:03.430 --> 13:05.350
base I mean something's great here what

13:05.350 --> 13:08.389
happened you have an island to look for

13:08.389 --> 13:10.790
out of 300 Islands find the one that's

13:10.790 --> 13:12.730
shaped like the one that was in the book

13:12.730 --> 13:16.820
the one with the elephants from here you

13:16.820 --> 13:19.760
come across Oak Island

13:19.760 --> 13:21.780
what's the next thing you do the next

13:21.780 --> 13:24.430
thing down from 1 by 8 by 4 which is

13:24.430 --> 13:26.810
actually from one body by 4 the first

13:26.810 --> 13:28.620
thing you do is behind the tree the

13:28.620 --> 13:30.570
first tree that the beginners boys found

13:30.570 --> 13:34.910
in 1795 the tree that was so obvious in

13:34.910 --> 13:38.709
1795 after seen strange lights coming

13:38.709 --> 13:39.709
from Oak Island

13:39.709 --> 13:42.670
the teenager Daniel McGinnis along with

13:42.670 --> 13:46.899
two companions went to investigate

13:46.899 --> 13:49.519
what they found was an unusual circular

13:49.519 --> 13:51.600
impression in the ground under the

13:51.600 --> 13:55.420
branch of an old oak tree believing the

13:55.420 --> 13:57.209
impression to be evidence of something

13:57.209 --> 14:01.230
buried below the boys began to dig

14:01.230 --> 14:04.420
deeper and deeper until that came upon

14:04.420 --> 14:07.010
wooden planks and stones at 10-foot

14:07.010 --> 14:11.079
intervals over the next few years they

14:11.079 --> 14:14.430
found bits of gold chain coconut fiber

14:14.430 --> 14:17.200
and even a large stone slab edged with

14:17.200 --> 14:20.459
strange markings until the hole became

14:20.459 --> 14:23.740
flooded with seawater and the legend of

14:23.740 --> 14:28.209
the Oak Island money pit was born

14:28.209 --> 14:30.790
looking at this right here you have the

14:30.790 --> 14:33.240
money pit where the tree was yeah now if

14:33.240 --> 14:37.820
you do what it says 14 north and go

14:37.820 --> 14:40.839
opposite you go 14 radsolv the next

14:40.839 --> 14:42.610
thing you have to do is you have to go

14:42.610 --> 14:45.180
30 rods and it says south west you have

14:45.180 --> 14:46.180
to go with north east

14:46.180 --> 14:50.010
thirty rods to their lands right on that

14:50.010 --> 14:54.760
line x marks your spot let me ask you

14:54.760 --> 14:57.889
something if I said to you right now

14:57.889 --> 15:01.779
you can have five million dollars or

15:01.779 --> 15:04.180
I'll give you enough money to dig you

15:04.180 --> 15:10.570
can have what's here what would you do I

15:10.570 --> 15:13.290
dig okay well I like that answer

15:13.290 --> 15:15.829
interesting thing about Robert Marcus is

15:15.829 --> 15:17.780
that a lot of people come and have this

15:17.780 --> 15:19.410
theory in that theory but he is willing

15:19.410 --> 15:22.150
to put an X on the map right here 40

15:22.150 --> 15:24.970
feet down why not dig the x marks the

15:24.970 --> 15:27.620
spot before Marcus is it is who knows

15:27.620 --> 15:30.760
what we might find I had Jack look for

15:30.760 --> 15:34.210
the spot via GPS Jack did it the modern

15:34.210 --> 15:35.352
way you and I are gonna do it the

15:35.352 --> 15:36.630
old-fashioned way and we're gonna see if

15:36.630 --> 15:39.040
we end up at the same spot as now no

15:39.040 --> 15:40.240
problem this is gonna be like an

15:40.240 --> 15:42.149
old-fashioned treasure hunt we have an x

15:42.149 --> 15:45.410
marks the spot employment this is an old

15:45.410 --> 15:47.980
fish you know what you are so right on

15:47.980 --> 15:50.410
that okay let's find out though the

15:50.410 --> 15:52.889
exact location of the original money pit

15:52.889 --> 15:55.860
has been lost since the 1860s due to

15:55.860 --> 15:57.160
repeated excavations

15:57.160 --> 16:01.699
Rick Marty and the team believe they may

16:01.699 --> 16:03.649
have rediscovered it last year

16:03.649 --> 16:07.209
definitely when they drilled into what

16:07.209 --> 16:09.959
could be a treasure vault first reported

16:09.959 --> 16:13.220
in 1897 that's what they found at the

16:13.220 --> 16:17.710
top of the wall okay so we want to go

16:17.710 --> 16:20.339
339 feet due east from that point and

16:20.339 --> 16:22.050
remember that we're already fourteen

16:22.050 --> 16:25.120
feet north okay yep okay what's the

16:25.120 --> 16:26.910
measurement 200 something right we got

16:26.910 --> 16:28.550
to get our easterlies but don't worry

16:28.550 --> 16:30.490
about the measurement we're gonna find

16:30.490 --> 16:34.040
the spot using Marcus's coordinates it

16:34.040 --> 16:35.490
basically just gives an easterly and a

16:35.490 --> 16:38.850
northerly bearing and to this X but

16:38.850 --> 16:40.850
first we have to find it

16:40.850 --> 16:44.690
yeah that steak has to go to the north

16:44.690 --> 16:47.350
you know that way

16:47.350 --> 16:50.160
Yeah right there just have this edge

16:50.160 --> 16:51.600
line up with that steak over there and

16:51.600 --> 16:54.170
slide it all the way that way does that

16:54.170 --> 16:56.300
look about right yeah in the U P we do

16:56.300 --> 16:57.480
what we have to do in order to

16:57.480 --> 16:59.320
accomplish the task at hand and that's

16:59.320 --> 17:02.329
what we did we use a 2 by 6 and we use

17:02.329 --> 17:04.170
the measuring tape I mean it doesn't get

17:04.170 --> 17:06.010
more basic than that that's you per

17:06.010 --> 17:07.609
engineering it surely is you per

17:07.609 --> 17:13.250
ingenuity that it right there

17:13.250 --> 17:15.709
so we found we believe with a reasonable

17:15.709 --> 17:18.270
degree of accuracy where Robert Marcus

17:18.270 --> 17:21.210
would like us to dig I claim this spot

17:21.210 --> 17:26.650
plus there it is x marks the spot

17:26.650 --> 17:29.570
according to mr. Marcus it's worth a dig

17:29.570 --> 17:31.539
let's dig it it'll be farming yeah

17:31.539 --> 17:32.539
tomorrow we dig

17:32.539 --> 17:34.800
Oh red truck coming where comes a truck

17:49.700 --> 17:55.410
yeah that looks like capability right

17:55.410 --> 18:01.890
there

18:01.890 --> 18:05.210
finally after years of research

18:05.210 --> 18:08.960
experimentation and planning it is time

18:08.960 --> 18:11.270
to start digging that looks good I like

18:11.270 --> 18:13.450
the looks of that

18:13.450 --> 18:15.820
and to find out once and for all if any

18:15.820 --> 18:17.799
of the myths and legends about a

18:17.799 --> 18:21.030
mysterious buried treasure are true to

18:21.030 --> 18:22.740
see that stuff come across the causeway

18:22.740 --> 18:24.520
it's like bringing in the tanks when

18:24.520 --> 18:26.120
you're an infantryman you know you know

18:26.120 --> 18:28.500
yeah we could use that

18:28.500 --> 18:31.260
that's a nice machine

18:31.260 --> 18:34.110
pretty good-sized excavator I'm thinking

18:34.110 --> 18:36.419
of digging right in the middle of your

18:36.419 --> 18:38.290
house dad I've heard there's treasure

18:38.290 --> 18:41.670
under there

18:41.670 --> 18:49.090
like again welcome to Oak Island thank

18:49.690 --> 18:51.700
you Oak Island thanks Lawrence to be

18:51.700 --> 18:53.260
here did you feel anything when you came

18:53.260 --> 18:55.030
across this did you get it kind of a you

18:55.030 --> 18:57.150
kind of a jitter he did a little little

18:57.150 --> 18:59.400
scary feeling okay well a lot of history

18:59.400 --> 19:01.280
here's the guy I want to meet ya mr.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.630
Blankenship Mike Carlo dan Blankenship

19:03.630 --> 19:04.630
pleasure to meet you sir

19:04.630 --> 19:06.360
you have a lot of history here okay

19:06.360 --> 19:09.880
that's for sure today represents a

19:09.880 --> 19:13.799
momentous day for dan Blankenship at 92

19:13.799 --> 19:16.850
he has spent more time searching for

19:16.850 --> 19:19.419
treasure on Oak Island than anyone else

19:19.419 --> 19:21.990
in its history more than half his life

19:21.990 --> 19:24.500
in fact say this equipment was being

19:24.500 --> 19:26.690
offloaded 40 years ago what would you

19:26.690 --> 19:32.330
have done with it they did

19:32.330 --> 19:33.640
and when Dan was out there watching that

19:33.640 --> 19:36.080
equipment mentioned something you know

19:36.080 --> 19:37.980
Jesus I wish I'd have had those types of

19:37.980 --> 19:40.360
resources when I was doing my work so

19:40.360 --> 19:42.370
it's a big that's a big boon to our

19:42.370 --> 19:43.370
efforts

19:43.370 --> 19:47.270
but now seeing the big digging equipment

19:47.270 --> 19:49.630
represents a milestone that he has been

19:49.630 --> 19:52.669
dreaming up for more than 40 years

19:52.669 --> 19:55.410
because today his determination to find

19:55.410 --> 19:57.850
treasure on the island seems closer than

19:57.850 --> 20:04.080
ever to becoming a reality

20:04.080 --> 20:07.460
let's try give one little fold there and

20:07.460 --> 20:14.450
the way you go

20:14.450 --> 20:17.760
I'm very excited about actually two-week

20:17.760 --> 20:19.159
something I mean we've been frogging

20:19.159 --> 20:20.610
around out here with cameras and

20:20.610 --> 20:23.360
electronics and resistivity and stuff I

20:23.360 --> 20:25.390
mean at some point you have to dig I'm

20:25.390 --> 20:27.120
ready to dig

20:27.120 --> 20:29.760
I want to see the mystery salt what I

20:29.760 --> 20:31.860
like the lagina name associated with the

20:31.860 --> 20:34.140
Oak Island story yet for my father

20:34.140 --> 20:36.210
we asked dad if there's treasure on Oak

20:36.210 --> 20:38.690
Island what should we do and he didn't

20:38.690 --> 20:41.030
hesitate a moment he said do good with

20:41.030 --> 20:44.400
it but as excited as Rick Marty and the

20:44.400 --> 20:46.340
other members of the Oak Island team

20:46.340 --> 20:49.530
feel they are also aware that the

20:49.530 --> 20:51.810
islands long history offers as many

20:51.810 --> 20:54.690
sobering realities as it does

20:54.690 --> 20:57.309
opportunities for success last time

20:57.309 --> 20:59.020
really enormous equipment came across

20:59.020 --> 21:00.370
that causeway there was quite an

21:00.370 --> 21:02.659
excavation that went on out here we have

21:02.659 --> 21:05.120
to be careful to not repeat Robert

21:05.120 --> 21:07.760
dunfield's issues and even had good

21:07.760 --> 21:10.360
intent but use big equipment and we want

21:10.360 --> 21:13.400
to make sure we do this smart

21:13.400 --> 21:17.140
in 1965 just a few weeks after a tragic

21:17.140 --> 21:19.309
accident that claimed the lives of

21:19.309 --> 21:23.110
Robert rest on his son Bobby and two of

21:23.110 --> 21:25.400
their co-workers california geologist

21:25.400 --> 21:28.270
Robert Dunfield took over all treasure

21:28.270 --> 21:31.260
hunting operations on Oak Island after

21:31.260 --> 21:33.750
constructing the causeway which linked

21:33.750 --> 21:36.419
the island to the mainland he brought in

21:36.419 --> 21:39.179
a massive 70 ton digging crane along

21:39.179 --> 21:41.170
with other large-scale digging and

21:41.170 --> 21:44.120
drilling equipment but even after months

21:44.120 --> 21:46.919
of extensive excavations Dunfield

21:46.919 --> 21:49.230
failed to uncover any evidence of

21:49.230 --> 21:52.710
treasure instead he left much of Oak

21:52.710 --> 21:55.650
Island permanently scarred and many of

21:55.650 --> 21:57.309
its important stone markers and

21:57.309 --> 22:00.840
landmarks obliterated it is a legacy

22:00.840 --> 22:03.539
that Marty and Rick are determined not

22:03.539 --> 22:06.760
to repeat I know we're all eager to dig

22:06.760 --> 22:08.799
dig dig but it's getting late I say we

22:08.799 --> 22:09.799
call it a day

22:09.799 --> 22:12.200
round I've grown time for David last

22:12.200 --> 22:16.150
wine time for me tomorrow we hit it okay

22:16.150 --> 22:17.150
let's go right

22:17.150 --> 22:21.650
it
is the start of a new day on Oak

22:27.150 --> 22:29.169
Island

22:29.169 --> 22:31.030
but in spite of the eerie gloom that has

22:31.030 --> 22:33.650
enveloped the landscape

22:33.650 --> 22:36.830
Rick Marty and Jack Begley are

22:36.830 --> 22:38.780
determined to see if Robert Marcus's

22:38.780 --> 22:40.990
incredible theory will figure this out

22:40.990 --> 22:42.920
about a centuries-old map and a

22:42.920 --> 22:45.929
mysterious three number code could

22:45.929 --> 22:48.280
really pinpoint the exact location of a

22:48.280 --> 22:51.090
treasure that men have been looking for

22:51.090 --> 22:58.990
and dying for for over 200 years okay

22:58.990 --> 23:01.700
we found where Robert Marcus would like

23:01.700 --> 23:05.000
us to dig so we're going to dig as deep

23:05.000 --> 23:06.820
as we can with that big excavator we

23:06.820 --> 23:11.270
have it's time to dig while Marty

23:11.270 --> 23:13.760
operates the 40-ton excavator which is

23:13.760 --> 23:15.799
capable of digging up to two yards of

23:15.799 --> 23:18.620
Earth per bucket his brother Rick will

23:18.620 --> 23:21.429
stand ready with the bulldozer just in

23:21.429 --> 23:25.059
case they need to level off the ground

23:25.059 --> 23:27.929
in my mind what we spend out here in

23:27.929 --> 23:30.710
terms of time and money has to do with

23:30.710 --> 23:32.250
risk reward ratio

23:32.250 --> 23:37.429
the reward is huge if any of these

23:37.429 --> 23:45.049
theories are correct

23:45.049 --> 23:49.760
righty-right treasure baby treasure

23:59.460 --> 24:03.070
fine

24:03.070 --> 24:04.850
following up on Robert Marcus's

24:04.850 --> 24:07.300
incredible theory that a 14th century

24:07.300 --> 24:10.190
map created by Henry Sinclair provided

24:10.190 --> 24:12.620
dimeric clues as to the exact location

24:12.620 --> 24:16.450
of the Oak Island treasure

24:16.450 --> 24:18.980
Rick and Marty lagina along with Jack

24:18.980 --> 24:21.429
Begley have started to do

24:21.429 --> 24:27.290
we're digging on Oh God Matt x marks the

24:27.290 --> 24:28.290
spot

24:28.290 --> 24:30.059
it's exciting what how can it not be

24:30.059 --> 24:31.059
excited

24:31.059 --> 24:33.531
now if we hit something of a historical

24:33.531 --> 24:34.531
nature that'd be great

24:34.531 --> 24:35.531
but look nobody is hoping for the

24:35.531 --> 24:41.070
treasure more than I am

24:56.070 --> 25:01.640
that is hard digging

25:01.640 --> 25:05.290
let's see what I got here that is hard

25:05.290 --> 25:07.020
hard hard digging look see you can

25:07.020 --> 25:08.450
always tell see the teeth mark in the

25:08.450 --> 25:09.450
sides

25:09.450 --> 25:12.840
imagine digging that by hand I can't

25:12.840 --> 25:15.100
imagine it makes me understand why the

25:15.100 --> 25:17.750
rest dolls were happy just to get 2

25:17.750 --> 25:20.429
inches a day it is fun to actually dig

25:20.429 --> 25:22.820
on Oak Island it is fun to have that big

25:22.820 --> 25:26.531
piece of equipment and dig why don't I

25:26.531 --> 25:28.490
just keep digging I'll try I keep trying

25:28.490 --> 25:33.010
to dig deeper until I can't dig deep and

25:33.010 --> 25:35.200
yes each bucket that you bring up might

25:35.200 --> 25:36.780
have something in it I mean I was hoping

25:36.780 --> 25:39.260
every time as we got deeper something

25:39.260 --> 25:44.309
would pop out of there

25:44.309 --> 25:48.920
is that Iraq

25:48.920 --> 25:56.730
that's just a rock right sure

25:58.130 --> 26:01.990
it's a piece of one Cimber a wood timber

26:01.990 --> 26:04.600
at the exact spot where theorist Robert

26:04.600 --> 26:07.059
Markus told Marty a treasure vault lies

26:07.059 --> 26:10.780
buried could it be that Rick Marty and

26:10.780 --> 26:13.210
Jack have found the entrance to an

26:13.210 --> 26:16.289
underground vault or treasure tunnel or

26:16.289 --> 26:20.919
could it simply be cribbing the wooden

26:20.919 --> 26:23.140
posts and boards used by miners and

26:23.140 --> 26:25.510
treasure hunters to reinforce deep

26:25.510 --> 26:29.850
tunnels and keep them from caving in

26:29.850 --> 26:32.200
really

26:32.200 --> 26:39.240
doesn't smell bad

26:39.240 --> 26:43.290
although the strange piece of wood may

26:43.290 --> 26:46.409
have turned out to be a false alarm one

26:46.409 --> 26:49.130
supposedly dead end could lead to a

26:49.130 --> 26:52.010
crucial piece of evidence being found

26:52.010 --> 26:58.140
I think I see something no way what is

26:58.140 --> 27:00.940
it hey Rick

27:00.940 --> 27:04.929
is this blue clay

27:04.929 --> 27:09.179
blue clay although the presence of blue

27:09.179 --> 27:11.840
clay appears disconnected from Rick and

27:11.840 --> 27:13.660
Marty search for an underground treasure

27:13.660 --> 27:16.600
vault the existence of layers of blue

27:16.600 --> 27:19.700
clay was first reported on the island by

27:19.700 --> 27:22.539
searchers digging in the money pit in

27:22.539 --> 27:27.140
1803 it has also been a long-held belief

27:27.140 --> 27:29.630
by gold miners that the presence of blue

27:29.630 --> 27:32.809
clay is a sign that gold or silver could

27:32.809 --> 27:34.370
very well be present underground

27:34.370 --> 27:40.550
take a few more

27:40.550 --> 27:50.830
that's why that blue flag it's right in

27:50.830 --> 27:53.410
the bottom

27:53.410 --> 27:55.090
but as encouraging at the presence of

27:55.090 --> 27:58.900
blue clay is it represents less a

27:58.900 --> 28:02.039
welcome clue and more of an unwelcome

28:02.039 --> 28:03.039
obstacle

28:03.039 --> 28:11.270
baby's wet pretty way yeah where's the

28:11.270 --> 28:15.929
water it looks wet right there can you

28:15.929 --> 28:16.929
see that

28:16.929 --> 28:18.620
where right there yeah

28:18.620 --> 28:21.720
oh now it's pouring in from this side

28:21.720 --> 28:25.559
you got a water of course about eight

28:25.559 --> 28:28.120
feet down coming in this foot it's

28:28.120 --> 28:31.000
coming quick - Rick I wonder if we are

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
close to something

28:32.000 --> 28:37.570
at Marty and Rick simply hit groundwater

28:37.570 --> 28:39.070
or might they have breached one of oak

28:39.070 --> 28:40.860
islands legendary flood tunnels

28:40.860 --> 28:45.510
if so it could mean that they are close

28:45.510 --> 28:48.799
to finding something of great value you

28:48.799 --> 28:51.100
diggin yeah

28:51.100 --> 28:52.260
Oh

28:52.260 --> 28:59.180
see some cribbing or some yeah

28:59.180 --> 29:03.870
so that was my home it's something

29:03.870 --> 29:06.341
you're only gonna get one or two more

29:06.341 --> 29:09.289
scoops and then it's gonna full-blown

29:09.289 --> 29:11.090
you know water you know let me have a

29:11.090 --> 29:14.100
look - just don't take a look what could

29:14.100 --> 29:17.150
have missed I suppose but the water was

29:17.150 --> 29:19.320
already coming in you aren't going to

29:19.320 --> 29:21.690
dig in that particular area much deeper

29:21.690 --> 29:23.529
without it flooding that water table is

29:23.529 --> 29:25.880
consistent there's nothing stopping us

29:25.880 --> 29:27.510
undisturbed yeah BQ I wouldn't take

29:27.510 --> 29:29.279
another step look at that it's breaking

29:29.279 --> 29:30.279
right there

29:30.279 --> 29:34.400
here water coming in there mm-hmm

29:34.400 --> 29:36.809
although Rick Marty and Jack had been

29:36.809 --> 29:39.240
stopped from digging any deeper they

29:39.240 --> 29:41.059
refused to give up on the notion that

29:41.059 --> 29:43.070
the place they are excavating might

29:43.070 --> 29:46.640
still be an important treasure site like

29:46.640 --> 29:47.640
what about the timber

29:47.640 --> 29:49.669
yeah to make

29:49.669 --> 29:55.820
yeah it smells kind of new I guess Jack

29:55.820 --> 29:57.510
about where I would be at is there

29:57.510 --> 29:58.929
should be more of it and there's not

29:58.929 --> 30:00.630
yeah if it was connected something we

30:00.630 --> 30:03.070
dug I dug far enough away to check that

30:03.070 --> 30:05.580
oh yeah you're right

30:05.580 --> 30:07.790
if the laginas and their partners have

30:07.790 --> 30:09.860
learned anything during their years on

30:09.860 --> 30:12.660
Oak Island it's that nothing ever comes

30:12.660 --> 30:15.630
easily and no theory no matter how

30:15.630 --> 30:18.390
far-fetched should be dismissed without

30:18.390 --> 30:21.500
a proper investigation I think for the

30:21.500 --> 30:22.950
time being before dinner

30:22.950 --> 30:25.899
let me paraphrase Churchill we're not

30:25.899 --> 30:26.899
done here

30:26.899 --> 30:30.000
but we're done here for today I believe

30:30.000 --> 30:32.080
Robert Marx's theory requires the

30:32.080 --> 30:35.159
treasure chamber to be in the drawer I

30:35.159 --> 30:37.160
and so we've run out of room fast at

30:37.160 --> 30:39.200
that particular location doesn't mean

30:39.200 --> 30:43.480
we're gonna bend it let's fill this hole

30:43.480 --> 30:44.480
in it's dangerous

30:44.480 --> 30:47.900
the long fable money bitch

31:03.000 --> 31:09.870
now let's see if we can accomplish here

31:09.870 --> 31:13.260
okay gentlemen we're here to discuss

31:13.260 --> 31:15.380
recontouring this when we're gonna need

31:15.380 --> 31:17.100
some heavy equipment to do it and we

31:17.100 --> 31:18.779
need to get the water to run off this

31:18.779 --> 31:20.740
way or you want to check and see if we

31:20.740 --> 31:22.780
can make it go that way see up there all

31:22.780 --> 31:26.440
right let's look after digging at the

31:26.440 --> 31:28.820
precise spot where Oak Island researcher

31:28.820 --> 31:31.559
Robert Markus indicated a vast treasure

31:31.559 --> 31:34.420
could be located and finding only blue

31:34.420 --> 31:38.600
clay and water today Rick Marty and the

31:38.600 --> 31:40.909
team are turning their attention to the

31:40.909 --> 31:43.540
infamous money pit it's really important

31:43.540 --> 31:45.080
Dan that you're here because you have

31:45.080 --> 31:47.350
the most knowledge of what this looked

31:47.350 --> 31:49.350
like originally we know the money pit

31:49.350 --> 31:53.169
was somewhere there we also know that

31:53.169 --> 31:54.990
Robert Dunfield dug very close to this

31:54.990 --> 31:57.500
area right basically it would have been

31:57.500 --> 32:00.720
this whole big area after months of

32:00.720 --> 32:03.250
extensive and arguably excessive

32:03.250 --> 32:05.360
excavations at the site by treasure

32:05.360 --> 32:09.940
hunter robert dunfield in 1965 the exact

32:09.940 --> 32:12.240
location of the original money pit was

32:12.240 --> 32:14.279
lost for nearly five decades

32:14.279 --> 32:19.900
I would get a full barrel that is until

32:19.900 --> 32:22.929
last year when Rick Craig tester and

32:22.929 --> 32:26.620
Dave Blankenship drilled 140 feet down

32:26.620 --> 32:28.669
in an area that Craig had identified

32:28.669 --> 32:30.940
from a series of antique maps and

32:30.940 --> 32:35.059
careful measurements

32:35.059 --> 32:37.529
the result was a core sample that

32:37.529 --> 32:39.450
revealed evidence of what could very

32:39.450 --> 32:42.710
well have been a wooden vault possibly

32:42.710 --> 32:45.070
the same one that was first discovered

32:45.070 --> 32:47.460
by treasure hunter William Chappell back

32:47.460 --> 32:51.519
in 1897

32:51.519 --> 32:54.850
definitely got wood that's definitely

32:54.850 --> 32:58.280
clay concrete and then wood that's the

32:58.280 --> 33:00.390
description that's what they found in

33:00.390 --> 33:04.010
the top of the vault

33:04.010 --> 33:06.679
last year we drilled into what seems to

33:06.679 --> 33:09.779
be one of the original halls but we knew

33:09.779 --> 33:11.940
we were right on the edge we just didn't

33:11.940 --> 33:13.400
know whether we were on the outside edge

33:13.400 --> 33:14.880
or the inside edge or the south edge of

33:14.880 --> 33:17.679
the north edge although finding the

33:17.679 --> 33:20.299
fabled wooden vault suggests the

33:20.299 --> 33:22.340
partners are close to finding the money

33:22.340 --> 33:25.320
pit they still can't be sure of its

33:25.320 --> 33:29.230
exact location what they are sure of is

33:29.230 --> 33:31.210
that finding the money pit and then

33:31.210 --> 33:34.640
excavating it will take time persistence

33:34.640 --> 33:37.620
and an estimated two million dollars

33:37.620 --> 33:40.330
more than the team can risk spending

33:40.330 --> 33:42.660
unless they find absolute evidence that

33:42.660 --> 33:44.460
they have located the pit and that

33:44.460 --> 33:46.700
something of incredible value really

33:46.700 --> 33:49.600
could be down there what other shafts

33:49.600 --> 33:53.250
might we uncover if we kept digging here

33:53.250 --> 33:54.610
probably the hidden shaft

33:54.610 --> 33:58.820
I'm thinking that this is almost exactly

33:58.820 --> 34:02.539
the corner and of course if this is the

34:02.539 --> 34:05.170
end its rectangular so the other end

34:05.170 --> 34:10.330
would be down there in 1937 treasure

34:10.330 --> 34:13.210
hunter Gilbert Hedden constructed a 24

34:13.210 --> 34:16.099
by 12 foot wood crib vertical shaft that

34:16.099 --> 34:18.050
intersected the original money pit at

34:18.050 --> 34:22.070
its northwest corner approximately 125

34:22.070 --> 34:25.730
feet deep underground although Robert

34:25.730 --> 34:27.480
dunfield's massive excavations

34:27.480 --> 34:29.739
obliterated numerous searcher shafts and

34:29.739 --> 34:33.750
tunnels dating back to 1795 the Hedden

34:33.750 --> 34:37.168
shaft was supposedly left intact let's

34:37.168 --> 34:39.599
say we dug down we saw the entire

34:39.599 --> 34:41.981
rectangle of the head and shaft would

34:41.981 --> 34:44.199
that help us get to exactly where the

34:44.199 --> 34:47.909
top of the money pit was bearing in mind

34:47.909 --> 34:50.389
that there's nothing undisturbed above a

34:50.389 --> 34:53.070
100 foot depth I mean just right across

34:53.070 --> 34:54.070
the board

34:54.070 --> 34:55.070
I mean it's just been although though we

34:55.070 --> 34:56.350
could at least with the best of our

34:56.350 --> 34:59.270
knowledge if we had this head and shaft

34:59.270 --> 35:00.400
excavated we would have a much better

35:00.400 --> 35:02.200
idea where the original money pit was we

35:02.200 --> 35:04.270
couldn't be for sure but we know now

35:04.270 --> 35:06.290
won't be far all right Rick what do you

35:06.290 --> 35:08.589
say to getting a good sized excavator in

35:08.589 --> 35:10.910
here and seeing if we can locate this

35:10.910 --> 35:13.250
precisely this head shaft

35:13.250 --> 35:15.770
what do you say I totally agree

35:15.770 --> 35:18.200
if we do this and we say this is it here

35:18.200 --> 35:19.840
is where the original money pit was you

35:19.840 --> 35:21.700
know the 12-foot diameter hole then I'd

35:21.700 --> 35:22.980
like to put a hole right down in the

35:22.980 --> 35:25.250
middle of that thing okay so here's what

35:25.250 --> 35:28.040
we're thinking that we take this and we

35:28.040 --> 35:30.170
dig down a boat not a very big area just

35:30.170 --> 35:32.430
another three feet and we take this

35:32.430 --> 35:36.109
overburden off and we look for the

35:36.109 --> 35:37.730
location of the head and shaft and then

35:37.730 --> 35:39.790
try and use that information and you

35:39.790 --> 35:41.550
could help us to figure out where the

35:41.550 --> 35:44.079
exact money pit was until we see it we

35:44.079 --> 35:46.570
don't know exactly where it is I like to

35:46.570 --> 35:48.400
see all four corners of it when you Ray

35:48.400 --> 35:54.240
I totally agree let's do this

35:54.240 --> 35:57.150
Rick Marty and the team could be on the

35:57.150 --> 35:59.220
verge of the greatest breakthrough they

35:59.220 --> 36:03.099
have ever experienced on Oak Island but

36:03.099 --> 36:06.410
finding the money pit is one thing

36:06.410 --> 36:08.240
digging a 150 foot deep hole to get to

36:08.240 --> 36:09.550
it is quite another

36:09.550 --> 36:13.619
especially since everyone who has tried

36:13.619 --> 36:16.070
has been quickly thwarted by a network

36:16.070 --> 36:19.940
of flood tunnels and a maze a mysterious

36:19.940 --> 36:21.490
underground booby traps

36:21.490 --> 36:26.129
or checking things off the list Big

36:36.829 --> 36:37.829
Brother

36:37.829 --> 36:42.099
as a new day begins so too does one of

36:42.099 --> 36:44.430
the most critical operations in rick and

36:44.430 --> 36:46.970
marty lagina's quest to solve the Oak

36:46.970 --> 36:51.500
Island mystery okay because today will

36:51.500 --> 36:54.390
be the first time in almost 50 years

36:54.390 --> 36:56.260
that ground will be broken in the area

36:56.260 --> 36:59.490
known as the money pit the money pit was

36:59.490 --> 37:02.140
lost long ago over a hundred years ago

37:02.140 --> 37:04.260
according to oral history and some

37:04.260 --> 37:07.820
documentation but they believed at that

37:07.820 --> 37:10.460
point that in connection with the head

37:10.460 --> 37:12.340
and shaft the money pit was very close

37:12.340 --> 37:15.160
thus if we can find the corners of the

37:15.160 --> 37:17.730
head and shaft we can for ourselves come

37:17.730 --> 37:19.720
up with that circle in order to dig up

37:19.720 --> 37:21.390
the head and shaft or what I'd like to

37:21.390 --> 37:23.510
see is bring in the small backhoe you're

37:23.510 --> 37:25.580
good on both of them so bring in a

37:25.580 --> 37:28.160
smaller one find the corner okay then we

37:28.160 --> 37:32.420
know where it is all right let's keep

37:32.420 --> 37:34.740
going let's dig

37:34.740 --> 37:37.130
I wanted to do it I wanted to see one of

37:37.130 --> 37:38.760
these shafts with my own eyes I've seen

37:38.760 --> 37:40.230
nothing but pictures of these things

37:40.230 --> 37:46.849
maybe just lifts your spirits a little

37:46.849 --> 37:49.660
it helps their enthusiasm if the Hedden

37:49.660 --> 37:51.720
shaft verifies that bat fall where we

37:51.720 --> 37:53.720
had the vault could be where the

37:53.720 --> 37:55.580
original money pit was

37:55.580 --> 38:02.660
there's no proper jobsite well a guy

38:02.660 --> 38:06.720
leaning on a show

38:06.720 --> 38:09.910
as the excavation begins Marty must dig

38:09.910 --> 38:12.300
carefully I'll get it

38:12.300 --> 38:14.160
it was exciting to dig that big bucket

38:14.160 --> 38:15.590
into the ground and start moving the

38:15.590 --> 38:18.300
earth but it was a delicate operation -

38:18.300 --> 38:20.470
I mean that's a big piece of equipment

38:20.470 --> 38:23.800
and I'm concerned that in the process of

38:23.800 --> 38:25.390
investigation we don't destroy what

38:25.390 --> 38:27.750
we're trying to find he will also need

38:27.750 --> 38:30.410
to rely on dan henskee memory of where

38:30.410 --> 38:32.060
the head and shaft is located

38:32.060 --> 38:40.140
ask is that all right okay I think right

38:40.140 --> 38:41.930
about there is where you're gonna find

38:41.930 --> 38:42.930
it

38:42.930 --> 38:45.151
okay all right where the shadow is yeah

38:45.151 --> 38:47.230
Esther May 12 feet from there and you're

38:47.230 --> 39:03.800
right about here it's good this he finds

39:03.800 --> 39:17.210
would you'll tell the tale

39:17.210 --> 39:33.320
hold up hold up wait what's that

39:33.320 --> 39:34.800
what Rick what a wreck that oak yeah I

39:34.800 --> 39:35.800
need to take that all

39:35.800 --> 39:36.800
shovel them

39:36.800 --> 39:49.210
right in front of that rock it's going

39:49.210 --> 39:51.599
that way yeah let me dig it this way we

39:51.599 --> 39:53.750
strike out so often on Oak Island where

39:53.750 --> 39:56.100
nothing pans out so running into wood I

39:56.100 --> 39:57.770
wanted to get that scoop in there and

39:57.770 --> 40:03.780
dig that thing out good idea get some

40:03.780 --> 40:07.530
dirt moves' switching from the backhoe

40:07.530 --> 40:10.920
to the 40-ton excavator will allow them

40:10.920 --> 40:13.660
to strategically dig in a longer trench

40:13.660 --> 40:14.660
like fashion

40:14.660 --> 40:32.790
tell you get

40:32.790 --> 40:39.050
campaign much deeper

40:39.050 --> 40:45.079
don't spend much time down there Rick

40:45.079 --> 40:47.819
looks like it's right here there's a

40:47.819 --> 40:49.040
beam

40:49.040 --> 40:53.480
a beam did Marty Rick and the Oak Island

40:53.480 --> 40:56.000
team just find an important piece of

40:56.000 --> 40:59.390
evidence is that a wall that could be

40:59.390 --> 41:01.721
the wall yep I think we found it could

41:01.721 --> 41:04.020
it be that they found not only another

41:04.020 --> 41:09.130
Oak timber but the Hedden shaft itself

41:09.130 --> 41:12.010
on Oak Island every new day could lead

41:12.010 --> 41:15.300
to a dead end or an incredible

41:15.300 --> 41:18.650
breakthrough and every shovel full of

41:18.650 --> 41:21.650
earth could reveal the answer to one of

41:21.650 --> 41:28.690
the world's most incredible mysteries

41:28.690 --> 41:30.490
next time on the curse of Oak Island

41:30.490 --> 41:34.440
isn't that a Templar cross this cross is

41:34.440 --> 41:36.520
Portuguese I do have evidence that puts

41:36.520 --> 41:40.589
them at this location in 1502 1580 we

41:40.589 --> 41:47.079
want to get to the bottom of 10-x this

41:47.079 --> 41:49.750
is not a routine dive

41:49.750 --> 41:54.490
there's a wall here we're hoping it'll

41:54.490 --> 41:56.760
help us identify where the money pit was

41:56.784 --> 42:00.084
