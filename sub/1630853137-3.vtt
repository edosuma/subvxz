WEBVTT

00:02.083 --> 00:05.291
It must be very difficult having
all those voices inside one head.

00:05.833 --> 00:09.791
Marc Spector. Steven Grant. Khonshu.

00:10.041 --> 00:12.083
- Give it back, you fool.

00:15.833 --> 00:17.166
- Can you hear him?

00:17.333 --> 00:20.375
- Not anymore.
I was his former Avatar.

00:20.666 --> 00:24.208
Khonshu punishes those
who have already walked an evil path.

00:24.291 --> 00:26.708
His retribution comes too late.

00:26.833 --> 00:29.500
Ammit tears evil up from the root.

00:29.875 --> 00:32.500
I wish you could live
to see the world we make.

00:32.625 --> 00:34.833
Yet, Ammit has decided.

00:36.791 --> 00:38.708
You don't need to doubt her judgment.

00:38.875 --> 00:40.625
Ammit will light the path to good.

00:40.916 --> 00:42.458
We must resurrect her.

00:42.833 --> 00:45.208
- Steven, I made a deal with Khonshu.

00:45.416 --> 00:47.708
That deal is contingent
on you not interfering.

00:47.791 --> 00:48.916
Now, give me the body.

00:51.750 --> 00:54.583
- That scarab functions
as a kind of compass,

00:54.666 --> 00:56.958
leading us to Ammit's tomb.

00:58.791 --> 01:00.250
- Summon the suit!

01:04.416 --> 01:06.041
Shit!

01:06.125 --> 01:07.458
We'll find the scarab.

01:07.791 --> 01:10.250
- Too late. Harrow has it.

01:10.625 --> 01:14.125
- Then we'll find another way.
We'll get to Ammit's tomb first.

01:23.250 --> 01:26.250
And then I found him, with the scarab,

01:26.625 --> 01:29.250
living 20 minutes from our old place.

01:33.500 --> 01:37.375
Now, he's probably going to get himself
killed running around Cairo.

01:43.708 --> 01:46.791
That's why you look so unhappy
to be going home.

01:48.791 --> 01:50.208
Anxious, maybe.

01:55.041 --> 01:56.416
It's been 10 years.

01:59.958 --> 02:02.166
- Not worried you might've
burned too many bridges?

02:02.833 --> 02:06.041
All those stolen relics
and cheeky antiques?

02:08.708 --> 02:10.666
- I don't steal.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.500
They've already been stolen.

02:14.041 --> 02:15.583
That's what people forget.

02:17.750 --> 02:21.250
I take them off the black market

02:21.875 --> 02:24.708
and return them to their rightful owners.

02:26.041 --> 02:28.083
I might keep a few to pay the bills.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.083
- Clever you.

02:31.125 --> 02:33.458
Not so innocent anymore, eh?

02:37.291 --> 02:40.416
I wonder what your father would think
of his little scarab now?

02:40.541 --> 02:42.458
Hmm. We'll never know.

02:43.208 --> 02:45.833
I can't believe he let you teach me
how to do all of this.

02:45.958 --> 02:48.708
Ha! The man indulged you.

02:49.541 --> 02:52.583
You think his dig sites
were any place for a child?

02:54.208 --> 02:59.250
Archeology. One big mess
of obsessive bookworms.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.875
Whatever happened in that desert
is lost to the sands.

03:06.041 --> 03:10.250
- It's a hard thing,
exhuming the pain of the past.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.833
-Easy to get stuck.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.750
Fixate on what's hurt us.

03:17.125 --> 03:19.125
- Great. Then I won't do either.

03:19.375 --> 03:20.791
- Like you aren't already.

03:22.416 --> 03:23.875
I miss him, too, is all.

03:25.166 --> 03:28.375
But that's your baggage, not mine.

03:31.583 --> 03:35.833
Just avoid your old haunts.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.916
Call me sentimental,
but I worry about you.

03:43.833 --> 03:45.208
Have a good trip, love.

03:49.291 --> 03:50.500
- Thanks.

05:04.541 --> 05:06.083
- We found Ammit.

05:09.291 --> 05:10.375
She's here.

05:17.625 --> 05:19.125
She's here.

05:22.125 --> 05:23.625
Marc Spector's in Cairo.

05:24.291 --> 05:25.291
He's tracking us.

05:26.041 --> 05:28.416
I know. She's here.

05:51.958 --> 05:52.958
Oh, shit.

05:53.458 --> 05:54.458
You killed him?

05:54.833 --> 05:56.083
I needed to talk to that guy.

05:56.583 --> 05:57.666
About a dig site.

05:58.791 --> 06:00.750
Guess I'm gonna have to
talk to you instead.

06:01.375 --> 06:02.375
You're too late.

06:03.166 --> 06:05.166
-You're never gonna find Harrow.
-Really?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.208
Oh, wow.

06:11.958 --> 06:15.041
Oh. What, are we dancin'? We fightin'?
What are we gonna do?

06:36.333 --> 06:37.333
Ow!

07:11.291 --> 07:12.291
- Marc.

07:13.875 --> 07:15.125
Don't do it, Marc.

07:15.208 --> 07:16.208
Stop it.

07:16.291 --> 07:17.291
Stop.

07:22.333 --> 07:23.500
Where's Steven?

07:32.458 --> 07:33.791
Where are you taking me?

07:34.958 --> 07:36.250
You are said airport.

07:36.916 --> 07:37.916
Airport.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.708
Wait, wait, wait. Stop! Stop!
Stop, stop! Stop, stop, stop!

07:45.166 --> 07:46.416
Let me talk to you.

07:47.666 --> 07:48.875
Just let us go, man.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.291
-That wasn't me!

07:50.375 --> 07:51.708
Let me talk to you for a second.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.541
Where's Harrow?

08:43.250 --> 08:45.541
Where is Harrow? Tell me.

08:45.666 --> 08:46.666
- Marc.

08:48.083 --> 08:49.916
Marc, that's enough.

09:03.958 --> 09:04.958
What?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.166
Oh, my God.

09:08.583 --> 09:09.583
Oh, God.

09:09.750 --> 09:10.916
Steven, what did you do?

09:11.041 --> 09:12.250
I swear. That wasn't me.

09:12.500 --> 09:13.583
- Then who was it?

09:22.791 --> 09:23.791
Where's the tomb?

09:25.416 --> 09:27.000
- Take him to the ledge.

09:27.916 --> 09:28.916
He's just a kid.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.750
He'll talk.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.583
Where is Harrow?

09:46.208 --> 09:47.208
Where is Harrow?

09:51.375 --> 09:53.000
-Praise Ammit.
-No, kid.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.125
- Mmm.

10:03.708 --> 10:05.750
I thought he'd talk.

10:08.750 --> 10:10.500
What the hell's wrong with you, Steven?

10:11.708 --> 10:14.375
Me? You're the one
going on a killing spree.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.666
I didn't do any of this.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.833
Me neither. Listen, if you've got
a problem with the body count,

10:19.916 --> 10:22.291
I suggest you stop listening
to that stupid pigeon.

10:23.041 --> 10:24.333
Stay out of my way.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.750
Well, if we can't find
Harrow's digging crew,

10:27.833 --> 10:29.583
we're gonna have to stop 'em another way.

10:33.041 --> 10:35.291
So? What about the other gods?

10:35.375 --> 10:38.625
Are they just gonna stand by
and allow somebody to unleash Ammit?

10:39.625 --> 10:44.166
- To signal for an audience
with the gods is to risk their wrath.

10:44.541 --> 10:46.375
Why? What's the worst that could happen?

10:46.958 --> 10:50.791
- Anger them enough
and they'll imprison me in stone.

10:52.166 --> 10:53.750
That doesn't sound so bad to me.

10:53.833 --> 10:55.958
- See how you fare against Harrow

10:56.041 --> 10:59.000
without the protection
of my healing armor.

10:59.083 --> 11:00.083
All right. So, what?

11:01.125 --> 11:02.250
Do you have any good ideas?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.500
- I have a bad one.

11:09.666 --> 11:10.708
Khonshu?

11:25.041 --> 11:26.500
What are you doing?

11:27.416 --> 11:30.500
- Sending the gods
a signal they can't ignore.

11:43.041 --> 11:44.041
- Help!

11:45.916 --> 11:47.791
You're getting desperate, old bird.

11:48.333 --> 11:53.291
Keep digging!
No matter what happens, keep digging!

11:55.208 --> 11:59.125
Do not stop. I'm about to be called upon.

11:59.375 --> 12:01.333
That was a bit over the top,
don't you think?

12:01.416 --> 12:04.833
- Hurry.
They're gathering their Avatars now.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.833
Aren't they scattered all over the world?

12:06.916 --> 12:09.541
- Yes.
But for a meeting of the Ennead,

12:09.625 --> 12:13.041
a portal presents itself anywhere.

12:13.125 --> 12:15.541
Okay. So, where's mine?

12:21.666 --> 12:25.833
- The last time I spoke
to the gods, they banished me.

12:25.916 --> 12:29.750
Our case against Harrow
must be indisputable.

12:33.791 --> 12:34.833
Aren't you coming with?

12:35.083 --> 12:37.166
- Oh, I'll be there.

12:55.458 --> 12:56.500
- I can't believe it.

12:57.750 --> 13:00.333
Oh, my days. We're inside.

13:00.916 --> 13:03.250
We're inside the Great Pyramid of Giza.

13:35.833 --> 13:38.333
Khonshu's theatrics are unparalleled.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.291
You must be his Avatar.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.666
- Hi. And who are you?

13:42.791 --> 13:45.958
-I'm Yatzil, Avatar of Hathor.
-Okay.

13:46.208 --> 13:47.666
Goddess of music and love?

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Cool.

13:49.083 --> 13:50.791
Surely Khonshu mentioned her?

13:53.291 --> 13:55.166
The gods aren't really his favorite topic.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.125
Not even when they are old friends?

13:57.333 --> 13:59.125
-Sorry.

13:59.375 --> 14:04.625
She says it was not so long ago
Khonshu enjoyed Hathor's melodies.

14:05.500 --> 14:09.500
Well, as far as I know, the only melody
Khonshu enjoys is the sound of pain.

14:09.791 --> 14:10.875
Yatzil.

14:23.916 --> 14:26.000
Has Khonshu told you how this works?

14:26.583 --> 14:29.208
Not really.
Is there somethin' I should know?

14:29.291 --> 14:30.791
I try not to fight it.

14:30.875 --> 14:34.791
It's a strange sensation.
But you'll get used to it.

14:34.875 --> 14:35.875
Great.

14:38.083 --> 14:43.833
In attendance, Horus, Isis, Tefnut,

14:44.208 --> 14:47.083
Osiris and Hathor,

14:47.833 --> 14:50.166
to hear the account of Khonshu.

14:53.125 --> 14:56.291
You've been banished once
for nearly exposing us, Khonshu.

14:57.458 --> 14:59.916
And you know we despise your garishness,

15:00.250 --> 15:02.000
your showy masks, and weapons.

15:03.375 --> 15:05.458
But manipulate the sky again

15:06.333 --> 15:08.583
and we will imprison you in stone.

15:09.041 --> 15:11.750
Spare me
your self-righteous threats!

15:12.500 --> 15:15.291
I was banished
for not abandoning humanity,

15:15.375 --> 15:17.000
unlike the rest of you.

15:17.916 --> 15:19.625
We have not abandoned humanity.

15:20.708 --> 15:21.750
They abandoned us.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.958
We simply trust our Avatars
to carry out our purposes

15:26.041 --> 15:28.583
without calling undue attention
to ourselves.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.208
Not like some of us.

15:30.291 --> 15:34.333
Avatars are not enough!
We need the might of gods.

15:35.500 --> 15:40.125
Return from the opulence of the Overvoid
before you lose this realm.

15:40.458 --> 15:42.166
For the last time, Khonshu...

15:43.458 --> 15:47.291
The Avatars that remain here
are simply meant to observe.

15:49.250 --> 15:53.041
We decided long ago
we did not wish to meddle

15:53.333 --> 15:54.708
in the affairs of man.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.666
We will decide our best course of action.

15:58.666 --> 15:59.791
Speak your purpose.

16:00.166 --> 16:03.958
I call for judgment against Arthur Harrow.

16:04.625 --> 16:05.750
The charges?

16:06.041 --> 16:08.500
Conspiracy to release Ammit!

16:09.791 --> 16:12.458
That is a heavy accusation, Khonshu.

16:16.916 --> 16:18.458
Let us summon the accused.

16:29.666 --> 16:35.291
So, I see by the presence
of Khonshu's current makeshift Avatar,

16:36.291 --> 16:39.666
the purposes of our meeting
must be nefarious.

16:39.750 --> 16:42.000
You know exactly why we are here!

16:42.750 --> 16:45.708
I must admit I do not miss
the sound of that voice.

16:46.458 --> 16:48.916
But speak, old master, to the point.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.708
Do you not seek to release Ammit
from her tomb?

16:52.833 --> 16:54.333
- I was in the desert.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.291
But if visiting the sands were a crime,

16:57.416 --> 17:00.833
the line of sinners
would be longer than the Nile.

17:01.666 --> 17:05.791
Khonshu has searched for Ammit's tomb

17:06.291 --> 17:08.583
since he ensnared me to his service.

17:08.958 --> 17:12.833
His vision is obscured
by jealousy, paranoia, and his...

17:12.916 --> 17:15.125
He is a deceiver!

17:15.250 --> 17:18.875
Do not trust the word of a shamed god.

17:19.416 --> 17:22.125
No, Khonshu is unhinged

17:22.250 --> 17:24.583
and his servant unwell.

17:24.958 --> 17:26.291
How do you mean?

17:29.166 --> 17:33.541
This is a man who literally does not know
his own name.

17:34.875 --> 17:37.291
He has a marriage certificate
under the name Marc Spector...

17:37.375 --> 17:38.375
Liar!

17:38.458 --> 17:40.208
Employment records
under the name Steven Grant.

17:40.333 --> 17:41.333
Stop!

17:41.416 --> 17:44.208
-I've seen him speak to himself...
-Shut up!

17:44.333 --> 17:46.583
Threaten himself.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.083
I have no idea how many personalities
he must possess.

17:51.333 --> 17:53.541
The man is clearly insane.

17:57.750 --> 18:02.916
We will not tolerate violence
in this Chamber.

18:08.041 --> 18:11.958
- It brings me no pleasure

18:12.500 --> 18:15.625
to tell you
that this is a deeply troubled man.

18:17.500 --> 18:23.750
Khonshu is taking advantage of him
the same way that he abused me,

18:25.083 --> 18:28.791
the way he aspires to abuse this court.

18:29.833 --> 18:32.291
Take action now before it's too late.

18:36.708 --> 18:38.500
Let us speak to Marc Spector.

18:46.666 --> 18:48.458
Are you unwell?

18:59.166 --> 19:02.041
I am. I am unwell.

19:06.416 --> 19:07.416
I need help.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.250
But that doesn't change the fact
that this man is...

19:18.791 --> 19:23.625
This is a safe space for you to tell us
if you feel exploited by Khonshu.

19:23.708 --> 19:27.750
This is not about my feelings!
I'm not the one on trial here. He is!

19:28.708 --> 19:32.250
This is about how dangerous he is
if you would just listen for a second.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.041
He has committed no offense.

19:37.875 --> 19:39.291
This matter is concluded.

20:13.916 --> 20:16.750
Marc? There is another way.

20:17.291 --> 20:19.250
-You must listen to me carefully.
-Yes. Yes.

20:19.333 --> 20:23.000
Ammit was buried in secret.
The location hidden even from the gods.

20:23.458 --> 20:25.958
Ammit had many followers.
I didn't know who to trust.

20:26.083 --> 20:27.541
But someone had to know something.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.666
One man. A medjay named Senfu.

20:29.750 --> 20:32.041
He was tasked with recording
the location of the tomb

20:32.125 --> 20:35.625
in case the gods ever changed their minds
and decided to show mercy.

20:36.583 --> 20:39.416
Find Senfu's sarcophagus
and you'll find your tomb.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.208
Okay. How am I supposed to do that?

20:41.291 --> 20:44.583
His sarcophagus was stolen
and sold on the black market.

20:44.666 --> 20:46.291
You might want to start there.

21:02.875 --> 21:03.916
- I'll take one.

21:05.250 --> 21:06.791
Perfect, one, sir.

21:07.916 --> 21:10.041
Best juice ever in the world.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.041
- I'm looking for Senfu's sarcophagus.

21:18.916 --> 21:20.041
Senfu?

21:24.541 --> 21:26.083
I hope you like attention.

21:28.083 --> 21:30.500
Right guy, right place.
But you're not Egyptian.

21:30.791 --> 21:34.375
Layla, what the hell are you doing here?
You shouldn't be here.

21:34.458 --> 21:38.333
Why? Because my name pisses off
a few people in Cairo? Who cares?

21:38.791 --> 21:40.541
It's not the locals
that I'm worried about.

21:42.750 --> 21:45.625
- Come with me.
I'll help you find what you need.

21:50.583 --> 21:53.416
- So what exactly are we gonna
do here? What's the plan?

21:53.750 --> 21:54.791
Oh.

21:55.833 --> 21:57.833
It's not pleasant
being left in the dark, is it?

22:00.583 --> 22:01.583
Okay.

22:02.541 --> 22:06.750
I get that you're not happy about me
leaving so quickly and coming to Cairo.

22:06.833 --> 22:07.833
I understand.

22:08.666 --> 22:10.250
Wait. Is that your apology?

22:11.791 --> 22:15.083
-That's good. That's really good.
-Just so we can get through tonight,

22:15.166 --> 22:17.416
maybe let's just give our shit
a rest for a moment

22:17.541 --> 22:20.083
and just try to strategize
before we get to...

22:20.166 --> 22:22.125
-Mogart's?
-Mogart?

22:22.208 --> 22:24.166
Just so you know,
I'm not here to help you.

22:25.375 --> 22:28.708
I'm here for me and for everyone else
who would die if Harrow succeeds.

22:29.875 --> 22:31.583
-Copy that.
-Good.

22:34.500 --> 22:35.541
I am sorry.

22:37.375 --> 22:38.833
For whatever that's worth.

22:44.250 --> 22:47.541
So, this Mogart guy.
He's really gonna have his sarcophagus?

22:47.833 --> 22:50.041
Yes. I asked around.

22:51.291 --> 22:54.583
Mogart's collection is prime gossip
for those of us who deal in antiquities.

23:05.750 --> 23:09.375
I haven't heard that sound since...
Since our wedding.

23:16.083 --> 23:20.791
You could've told me. You know?
What's it's been like for you.

23:22.666 --> 23:23.666
About Steven.

23:26.875 --> 23:29.750
For what it's worth, I had it
under control until very recently.

23:30.750 --> 23:31.750
What happened?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.041
Doesn't matter.

23:39.625 --> 23:41.333
- We could've handled it together.

23:43.333 --> 23:44.333
Yeah.

23:46.750 --> 23:48.625
That's not really what I do, is it?

23:50.541 --> 23:54.833
Never really been able to just
talk about everything.

23:56.125 --> 23:57.250
Anything real?

24:02.416 --> 24:03.416
Yes.

24:03.833 --> 24:04.833
Yeah, I know.

24:05.333 --> 24:09.291
But that doesn't mean
that we shouldn't have.

24:12.250 --> 24:16.958
Yeah. Maybe.
A little too late for that now, though.

24:27.125 --> 24:30.416
Okay. Let's get our story straight.

24:39.041 --> 24:40.416
This guy's got a lot of friends.

24:40.583 --> 24:42.500
- Yeah, and a lot with guns.

24:55.541 --> 24:56.541
What is it?

24:59.791 --> 25:01.291
Harrow's men keeping tabs?

25:01.541 --> 25:02.750
I don't know. It could be.

25:05.958 --> 25:07.041
Let's go.

25:08.166 --> 25:10.750
Remember, your name is Rufino Estrada.

25:10.833 --> 25:11.833
- Right.

25:12.333 --> 25:14.791
We just got back from our honeymoon
in the Maldives.

25:17.291 --> 25:19.500
That's an interesting little detail
to give to them.

25:19.583 --> 25:21.375
I'd tell them you worked at a gift shop,

25:21.458 --> 25:23.250
but they'd never believe me, would they?

25:40.083 --> 25:41.083
Bek.

25:41.791 --> 25:42.791
Layla.

25:42.916 --> 25:43.916
- It's been a while.

25:44.666 --> 25:46.000
-Good to see you.
-Yeah.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.708
-Right this way.
-Thank you.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.583
- He's looking forward to seeing you.

25:51.666 --> 25:54.750
After Madripoor I'm sure you two
will have a lot to talk about.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.458
Excuse me for one moment.

25:57.791 --> 25:59.416
Mr. Mogart will be with you shortly.

26:03.541 --> 26:05.666
So what? This joker just puts on
El-Mermah games

26:05.750 --> 26:07.375
in his backyard, for fun?

26:08.041 --> 26:13.041
No, he gets private lessons by the best
in his backyard.

26:14.083 --> 26:15.083
- Cool.

26:16.708 --> 26:17.708
I like the robe.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.750
Layla. Come in.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.833
Such a delight to see you.

26:26.083 --> 26:27.083
You, too.

26:27.416 --> 26:28.500
How have you been?

26:28.583 --> 26:31.791
Good. Thank you for having us over
on such short notice.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.708
Oh, please. I hope you realize
you need no excuse to drop by.

26:36.458 --> 26:38.416
This is my husband, Rufino.

26:39.291 --> 26:41.500
-- Nice to meet you.
-Pleasure.

26:41.583 --> 26:42.666
Oh. Right.

26:44.500 --> 26:47.583
I hope you understand
this is more than a collection to me.

26:48.250 --> 26:51.833
Preserving history is a responsibility
I take very seriously.

26:53.041 --> 26:57.458
A self-appointed responsibility
that you alone were able to enjoy, no?

26:57.833 --> 27:04.333
Well, I prefer to see it
as a philanthropic effort at preservation.

27:05.958 --> 27:10.250
Now, if I may ask, why such interest
in Senfu in particular?

27:10.416 --> 27:11.833
Oh, actually, our purchases are...

27:11.958 --> 27:15.791
I'm sorry. I'd like to hear
from your husband, if you don't mind.

27:15.875 --> 27:18.125
- Hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

27:18.208 --> 27:22.958
I think that... But I think
I just would love to take a look.

27:25.250 --> 27:26.250
Funny man.

27:30.250 --> 27:31.250
Feel free.

27:31.666 --> 27:33.791
-Great.
-Yeah. Great.

27:35.958 --> 27:39.000
- Please, just let Steven out
before you blow this.

27:39.083 --> 27:41.625
Not a chance. All right, what do you see?

27:42.833 --> 27:46.041
Well, the burial practices are in line
with the Studenwachen texts.

27:46.125 --> 27:47.125
- The what?

27:47.541 --> 27:49.208
It's legit.

27:49.291 --> 27:51.791
But all I'm seeing is literature
to guide the dead.

27:51.875 --> 27:53.041
Uh-huh.

27:53.125 --> 27:54.791
There's no location indicated.

27:55.166 --> 27:57.166
- Because the information
has to be unlocked.

27:57.500 --> 27:58.500
It's coded.

27:59.875 --> 28:01.041
Okay, um...

28:02.208 --> 28:05.250
Will you give me a minute?
I gotta talk to Steven...

28:05.333 --> 28:07.083
Just keep him occupied.

28:12.250 --> 28:15.250
All right, Steven, you wanna talk to me?
Talk to me. What now?

28:15.333 --> 28:18.750
What now? What now is,
you give me the body and you piss off.

28:18.833 --> 28:20.916
Damn it, there's not time for this.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.916
Tell me if there's something
that you know.

28:23.291 --> 28:26.083
He just needs a couple minutes
in there alone,

28:26.375 --> 28:28.875
'cause... Yeah. He is...

28:32.125 --> 28:33.125
He's praying.

28:33.416 --> 28:36.583
Sorry. If you expect my help,
it's not gonna be while I'm imprisoned.

28:36.666 --> 28:38.500
Do you want a bloodbath? Huh?

28:39.333 --> 28:41.541
-Fine, have it your way.
-All right.

28:41.916 --> 28:43.708
You are the worst.

28:44.125 --> 28:45.333
Check the cartonnage.

28:46.583 --> 28:48.291
Okay. What do I do?

28:48.416 --> 28:51.125
Take that first piece
and fold it over the middle piece.

28:51.208 --> 28:52.708
-This one?
-Yes, that one.

28:57.208 --> 28:59.041
-Like this?
-Yeah.

29:01.750 --> 29:02.750
- Wait a second.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.791
- Now, if you match those stars up

29:04.875 --> 29:07.125
with the other piece over there,

29:07.250 --> 29:09.291
-it should make a star...
-- What are you doing?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.250
Marc! Don't.

29:16.958 --> 29:17.958
Shit!

29:23.333 --> 29:24.916
- Do you really think I'm an idiot?

29:27.250 --> 29:29.125
-Get on your knees.
-Anton, stop!

29:29.208 --> 29:30.250
Get on your knees.

29:31.166 --> 29:32.166
Okay.

29:37.708 --> 29:41.458
Layla, I was so ready
to make peace with you.

29:41.541 --> 29:44.833
You don't understand.
We're trying to save many lives.

29:44.916 --> 29:48.333
Hey, pal.
Take a look inside the sarcophagus.

29:50.083 --> 29:51.791
There's somethin' really, really big.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.041
Well, that's interesting.

30:02.125 --> 30:04.958
It appears we have a concerned
third party here.

30:05.708 --> 30:06.708
Get up.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.291
Whatever they've told you,

30:10.375 --> 30:13.041
I'm sure I can offer you something
much more tangible.

30:16.875 --> 30:20.291
Why settle for a clue
when you can have the treasure?

30:20.375 --> 30:24.166
Anton. Anton, don't listen to this man.
He's trying to stop us from reaching...

30:24.458 --> 30:25.458
Please, stop.

30:25.541 --> 30:27.041
He's gonna kill millions, trust me!

30:27.125 --> 30:28.875
Are you seriously talking about trust?

30:28.958 --> 30:33.208
Please, there's no need to descend
into violent accusations.

30:33.458 --> 30:36.708
Each one of you has so much more in common
than you know.

30:37.166 --> 30:38.166
Layla,

30:39.500 --> 30:41.541
you keep thinking that distance

30:42.208 --> 30:46.125
will prevent the wounds
from your father's murder from reopening.

30:46.208 --> 30:48.125
But something stands in your way.

30:48.750 --> 30:50.625
Your husband doesn't tell you the truth.

30:52.041 --> 30:56.416
And Marc, you don't tell her
because you know that if you do,

30:56.750 --> 30:59.458
she'll see you exactly
as you see yourself,

30:59.541 --> 31:01.416
as unworthy of love.

31:01.500 --> 31:02.625
You piece of shit.

31:02.916 --> 31:03.916
Anton...

31:05.666 --> 31:07.833
The lore surrounding these relics,

31:07.916 --> 31:10.208
I offer proof that it's real.

31:14.083 --> 31:18.000
This sarcophagus doesn't belong to anyone.

31:19.291 --> 31:21.666
- Do it. Summon the suit.

31:23.541 --> 31:25.375
Give them what they deserve.

31:25.541 --> 31:26.541
- Anton...

31:28.083 --> 31:29.833
Would you like to see for yourself?

31:30.583 --> 31:31.583
Yes.

31:32.291 --> 31:33.500
I do.

31:45.833 --> 31:47.708
- What are you waiting for?

31:57.791 --> 32:01.416
That's just a taste
of the godly power I offer.

32:09.666 --> 32:11.291
Hey, he's gone.

32:11.875 --> 32:12.875
- Where is he?

32:40.041 --> 32:42.250
-Buy me some time.
-I can do that.

33:22.791 --> 33:24.500
- Marc, stop it! Stop it!

33:26.708 --> 33:27.791
No, Marc!

33:39.625 --> 33:41.916
-Give me the body, Marc!

33:47.583 --> 33:50.000
Oh! Sorry.

33:50.166 --> 33:51.458
You all right?

33:52.250 --> 33:54.125
That's it. All right, time out.

33:54.333 --> 33:57.583
That's it, time out!
Guys, let's all calm down, yeah?

33:57.666 --> 33:58.708
We're all worked up.

33:58.833 --> 34:02.208
Let's all just, like, chill the F out
and talk for a second...

34:03.375 --> 34:06.875
Take the body.
Take the body, take the body, Marc.

34:50.583 --> 34:51.625
Layla!

35:21.416 --> 35:22.500
-You okay?
-- Yeah.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.875
-Do you have it?
-Yeah.

35:25.041 --> 35:26.583
-We need a car.
-Yeah, come on.

35:27.041 --> 35:30.791
- Tick-tock, Marc Spector.
Tick-tock.

35:35.750 --> 35:36.750
- Ay.

35:38.166 --> 35:39.625
I really liked that jacket.

35:41.333 --> 35:42.333
Oh, well.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.416
What was Harrow talking about?

35:46.375 --> 35:47.416
What do you mean?

35:48.500 --> 35:50.000
He said I had a right to know.

35:51.916 --> 35:53.166
I have no idea.

35:55.083 --> 35:57.166
I never told anyone why I really moved.

35:57.541 --> 36:00.625
I mean, but he knew,
he just saw right through me.

36:00.750 --> 36:02.416
He's just trying to mess with you.

36:02.500 --> 36:04.375
You know, he's trying to get in your mind.

36:05.583 --> 36:06.750
No, don't let him do that.

36:06.833 --> 36:09.166
You know, he's got this idea
that he can see

36:09.250 --> 36:13.500
the true nature of people
or some baloney like that.

36:13.583 --> 36:16.958
If that were true, I don't think he'd have
a bunch of homicidal maniacs

36:17.041 --> 36:18.375
as his disciples, would he?

36:18.458 --> 36:21.083
So, it's not true?
What he said about you and...

36:21.166 --> 36:22.333
No, it's not true.

36:22.416 --> 36:26.250
No, he's just trying to divide us.
Don't let him get in your head.

36:26.333 --> 36:28.583
Every time I learn something new
about you,

36:28.708 --> 36:34.291
I think, "That's it. There can't possibly
be any secrets left between us."

36:35.625 --> 36:40.208
And then something else pops up,
and it's like I've not known you at all.

36:40.291 --> 36:42.958
Yeah. You haven't.

36:45.083 --> 36:46.083
You don't.

37:02.333 --> 37:03.500
- I've spotted them.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.041
- Try that.

37:34.458 --> 37:35.583
- Maybe, actually.

37:36.583 --> 37:37.833
- This one?
- Okay.

37:39.541 --> 37:41.625
Uh... No. Anything else?

37:42.666 --> 37:47.333
I'm not getting any whole constellations.
It's just little pieces and fragments.

37:54.291 --> 37:55.500
This is gonna take forever.

37:58.875 --> 38:01.833
-Marc, we need Steven.

38:04.041 --> 38:07.291
He understands all of this. I really think
it's worth giving him a shot.

38:09.958 --> 38:12.958
- I summon the gods,
you summon the worm.

38:13.041 --> 38:15.750
He won't return the body.

38:16.166 --> 38:19.333
- Marc, we can't wait.
It's okay, just let go.

38:19.416 --> 38:20.666
-We don't have time.

38:25.208 --> 38:26.208
What are you doing?

38:36.708 --> 38:38.541
All right, go ahead. You're in.

38:42.916 --> 38:44.208
Cheers, thanks a lot.

38:44.625 --> 38:46.875
All right. Yeah.

38:53.208 --> 38:54.208
Here we go.

38:59.125 --> 39:00.791
Don't need that.

39:00.916 --> 39:02.208
I don't need that.

39:04.458 --> 39:05.458
Steven?

39:11.750 --> 39:14.250
Egyptians invented modern navigation.

39:16.250 --> 39:18.208
There's not a lot of landmarks
in the desert.

39:18.791 --> 39:23.125
So they came up with a way
to get about using the sun and the stars.

39:23.541 --> 39:24.791
It's bloody genius, isn't it?

39:25.041 --> 39:26.041
Yeah.

39:27.291 --> 39:28.666
Et voilà.

39:29.541 --> 39:30.791
- Whoa.

39:32.833 --> 39:33.833
It's French.

39:34.041 --> 39:35.833
I know.

39:41.666 --> 39:42.958
So, what do we do with it?

39:45.375 --> 39:49.708
Well, I'm not sure, but if...

39:50.166 --> 39:51.416
Wait, hang on a minute.

39:52.333 --> 39:55.375
You see that?
You see those little pinpricks there?

39:55.458 --> 39:56.791
That's a constellation.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.916
- We should be able to triangulate
the stars into coordinates, right?

40:00.000 --> 40:01.166
Let me just scan it.

40:01.250 --> 40:05.708
Well, um, actually...
Unfortunately, it's not that simple.

40:06.416 --> 40:09.375
-Not working. Why isn't it working?
-Yeah, yeah, you see, Senfu...

40:09.458 --> 40:13.875
Senfu marked that tomb,
like, 2,000 years ago.

40:14.166 --> 40:17.583
And stars drift over time.
Not much as far as stars go,

40:17.666 --> 40:20.583
but it could mean the difference
between us searching miles away

40:20.666 --> 40:22.458
from where we're supposed to be looking.

40:22.833 --> 40:26.708
So unless we know exactly
what the sky looked like on that date,

40:28.166 --> 40:29.166
we're buggered.

40:29.250 --> 40:30.916
- I remember that night.

40:33.458 --> 40:35.458
I remember every night.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.041
- Khonshu?

41:02.708 --> 41:06.000
- I can turn back the night sky.

41:06.583 --> 41:09.208
-How?
-It will come at a cost,

41:09.291 --> 41:11.750
and I cannot do it alone.

41:18.500 --> 41:21.958
Steven, when the gods imprison me,

41:22.041 --> 41:23.875
tell Marc to free me.

41:39.250 --> 41:41.000
Do what I do.

41:43.166 --> 41:45.458
- Yeah? Like this?

41:45.750 --> 41:49.125
-Whoa!

41:53.416 --> 41:55.458
Oh, man! This is mental.

42:29.916 --> 42:32.208
- This is the night.

42:34.291 --> 42:36.416
- This is surprisingly painful.

42:36.500 --> 42:37.500
- It's working.

42:37.833 --> 42:39.166
- It's working. Yes.

42:39.750 --> 42:40.750
Good.

42:46.583 --> 42:48.958
You brought this upon yourself, Khonshu.

43:01.375 --> 43:03.833
- I can feel my energy leaving me.

43:21.125 --> 43:23.375
Oh, God, I don't know
how much longer I can do this.

43:24.833 --> 43:27.875
- Coordinates found,
29 degrees north, 25 east.

43:27.958 --> 43:32.250
-I got it. 29 degrees north, 25 east.

43:54.166 --> 43:55.166
- Steven.

44:01.208 --> 44:03.666
Hey, Steven? Marc?

44:03.750 --> 44:05.666
Come on. Come on.

44:05.750 --> 44:06.750
Where are you?

44:07.166 --> 44:09.000
Marc? Come on.

44:15.666 --> 44:17.375
- You were right about Khonshu.

44:19.458 --> 44:22.541
And in the end, he left us no choice.

44:29.375 --> 44:33.125
Now, he's tethered to this place,

44:36.208 --> 44:37.458
like many before him.

44:40.291 --> 44:41.291
Can he hear us?

44:43.291 --> 44:44.333
We think so, yes.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.541
- Can I tell you a secret?

45:11.333 --> 45:15.541
I enjoyed dealing out pain on your behalf.

45:17.708 --> 45:20.000
That is the greatest sin I carry.

45:24.083 --> 45:25.291
I am grateful.

45:26.916 --> 45:29.458
Had you not broken me so completely,

45:30.375 --> 45:33.083
I might never have known
the value of healing.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.125
I'm going to do what you could not.

45:48.250 --> 45:49.625
And when it's finished,

45:50.791 --> 45:52.666
I want you to remember one thing.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.750
Your torment forged me.

45:56.625 --> 45:58.375
I owe my victory to you.
