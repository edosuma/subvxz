WEBVTT

00:01.375 --> 00:05.289
I've got to say that this report
is quite impressive, Miss Knope.

00:05.409 --> 00:06.676
Thank you very much,
Mr. City Manager.

00:06.711 --> 00:08.411
And I have to say that the way

00:08.446 --> 00:09.446
that you're rockin'
those slacks

00:09.480 --> 00:10.561
is quite impressive as well.

00:10.581 --> 00:11.748
Well, thank you.

00:12.817 --> 00:14.217
- Can we hurry this up, please?
- What?

00:14.252 --> 00:15.752
There's nothing wrong
with acknowledging

00:15.786 --> 00:18.054
the fantastic work
of one of your employees,

00:18.089 --> 00:19.890
especially if she's adorable.

00:19.924 --> 00:21.424
I am back
at the parks department,

00:21.459 --> 00:22.759
and Ben is city manager,

00:22.794 --> 00:24.115
but we're married,
so it's kosher.

00:24.128 --> 00:26.096
And awesome.
We live together...

00:26.130 --> 00:27.330
- And work together.
- And we are so...

00:27.365 --> 00:28.465
In sync...

00:28.499 --> 00:29.566
That we finish each other's...

00:29.600 --> 00:31.435
Sentences!

00:31.469 --> 00:33.370
We rehearsed that at home.

00:33.404 --> 00:34.371
Naked in bed.

00:34.405 --> 00:36.173
- What!
- What!

00:36.207 --> 00:39.342
Please stamp the form.

00:39.377 --> 00:41.578
I just want to admire it
one more time.

00:41.612 --> 00:44.614
Again, fantastic work.

00:44.649 --> 00:47.250
In fact, such good work...

00:47.285 --> 00:48.585
I think I'm in love with you.

00:48.619 --> 00:50.253
Oh, my God, that's great news,

00:50.288 --> 00:51.354
'cause I'm in love
with you too.

00:51.389 --> 00:52.355
- What?
- What?

00:52.390 --> 00:53.590
Stamp the form.

00:53.624 --> 00:55.392
Okay, let's not let Ron feel
left out.

00:55.426 --> 00:56.426
We love you too, Ron.

00:56.461 --> 00:58.295
- Stamp the damn form.
- Group hug!

00:58.329 --> 00:59.529
Oh, I'm down for a group hug.

00:59.564 --> 01:01.264
- Little G.H.
- Bring it in.

01:01.299 --> 01:03.033
Come o--

01:05.001 --> 01:06.303
Wow.

01:06.337 --> 01:07.604
I think our love
made him angry.

01:07.638 --> 01:08.705
I think he broke my wrist.
I'm not kidding.

01:08.739 --> 01:09.706
Really?

01:29.927 --> 01:31.228
Good morning, Ann Perkins.

01:31.262 --> 01:32.262
How are you feeling today?

01:32.296 --> 01:33.630
Perfect.

01:33.664 --> 01:35.999
Except that I'm a whale
and that my feet already kill.

01:36.033 --> 01:37.601
Whales don't have feet.

01:37.635 --> 01:39.569
I am a crazy shape.

01:39.604 --> 01:40.904
This morning
when I got out of bed,

01:40.938 --> 01:42.105
I just tipped forward

01:42.140 --> 01:44.040
like a poorly made bowling pin.

01:44.075 --> 01:46.009
Did I mention that my feet
kill me all the time?

01:46.043 --> 01:47.010
Oh!

01:47.044 --> 01:48.011
Let me rub them.

01:48.045 --> 01:49.780
Oh, wait. No.

01:49.814 --> 01:51.815
I read something
on raddadsolutions.net

01:51.849 --> 01:53.550
that there's a pressure point
in the foot

01:53.584 --> 01:54.751
that could induce labor.

01:54.785 --> 01:56.386
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I don't care.

01:56.420 --> 01:57.954
I'm gonna go choke down
those horse pills

01:57.989 --> 01:59.156
I have to take every day.

01:59.190 --> 02:00.857
Oh, no, no, I'll cut them
in half for you.

02:00.892 --> 02:03.260
And I will pour you a glass
of flaxseed milk

02:03.294 --> 02:04.294
to wash it down.

02:04.328 --> 02:05.829
Everything is amazing.

02:05.863 --> 02:08.164
Today is perfect,
and I love you.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.267
Chris is so wonderful

02:10.300 --> 02:13.937
and thoughtful and positive.

02:13.971 --> 02:15.605
He's driving me
up the  wall.

02:15.640 --> 02:17.007
Smoothie's ready!

02:19.377 --> 02:21.511
Opening this farmers market

02:21.546 --> 02:24.147
was one of my greatest
achievements as city councilor.

02:24.182 --> 02:25.482
It's good for the economy,

02:25.516 --> 02:26.950
it's good for families,

02:26.984 --> 02:28.819
and it's good for promoting
a healthy lifestyle,

02:28.853 --> 02:31.154
which Pawnee desperately needs.

02:31.189 --> 02:33.390
Look at this tiny tree.

02:33.424 --> 02:34.958
Can you eat this?

02:34.992 --> 02:39.496
Aww. This one's dead.

02:39.530 --> 02:41.331
Hey, Connie Cabbage.

02:41.365 --> 02:42.799
What's good today?

02:42.834 --> 02:44.501
Green cabbage is always
a safe bet.

02:44.535 --> 02:45.502
Red cabbage is good.

02:45.536 --> 02:46.536
I mean,

02:46.571 --> 02:47.804
you can't go wrong.

02:47.839 --> 02:49.739
That's the fun thing
about cabbage.

02:49.774 --> 02:50.740
One of the fun things.

02:50.775 --> 02:51.741
Oh!

02:54.412 --> 02:57.013
Time to crank this market
up a notch, y'all!

02:57.048 --> 02:59.716
"Chardbodies:
Get a chard on"?

02:59.751 --> 03:03.420
Let's get "re-charded"
in here!

03:03.454 --> 03:05.222
- What the hell is going on?
- Oh, yeah.

03:05.256 --> 03:07.357
That's the new chard stand.

03:07.391 --> 03:09.760
I suppose that's one way
to sell vegetables.

03:09.794 --> 03:12.229
We got Swiss chard,
we got white chard,

03:12.263 --> 03:13.397
we got chard poppers!

03:13.431 --> 03:16.366
And for all you freaky vegans
out there...

03:16.400 --> 03:18.535
We got chard shots!

03:18.569 --> 03:20.203
Yeah!

03:20.238 --> 03:22.739
Mmm, chard is so bitter.

03:22.774 --> 03:24.407
Ben, do something.

03:24.442 --> 03:25.675
What do you want me to do?

03:25.710 --> 03:27.778
Well, you're the city manager.
Kick them out.

03:27.812 --> 03:29.780
They're violating
every single one

03:29.814 --> 03:31.181
of the farmers market's
rules of conduct.

03:31.215 --> 03:32.249
By "rules of conduct,"

03:32.283 --> 03:34.618
do you mean that wooden sign
you made

03:34.652 --> 03:36.052
that says,
"Peas be kind to others"?

03:36.053 --> 03:38.689
Yes, and "In case of fire,
romaine calm,"

03:38.723 --> 03:42.292
and "You won't bay leaf
how nice olive our vendors are."

03:42.326 --> 03:43.426
I don't like vegetables,

03:43.461 --> 03:44.895
but I'm very good
at vegetable puns.

03:44.929 --> 03:46.630
Okay, I admit this is
a little iffy, but...

03:46.664 --> 03:48.532
- A little iffy?
- I can't do anything

03:48.566 --> 03:50.467
until I check the rules
for city vendors.

03:50.501 --> 03:51.868
Cabbage!

03:51.903 --> 03:54.337
Come and...get it.

03:54.372 --> 03:55.972
Connie, no.

03:56.007 --> 03:57.908
Put those away.

03:57.942 --> 04:00.143

04:00.178 --> 04:02.913

04:02.947 --> 04:04.514

04:04.549 --> 04:06.383

04:06.417 --> 04:08.652
Oh, my God.
You play guitar?

04:08.686 --> 04:10.120
No, that's a super small piano.

04:10.154 --> 04:11.555
Okay, I'm gonna need
the sarcasm

04:11.589 --> 04:13.390
to take a long walk right now.

04:13.424 --> 04:14.791
My terrible nephew Sebastian

04:14.826 --> 04:16.526
is having his sixth birthday
party this weekend,

04:16.560 --> 04:17.928
and the clown they hired
has shingles.

04:17.962 --> 04:19.129
You think your band could play

04:19.163 --> 04:20.130
for an hour?

04:20.164 --> 04:21.898
- How much?
- 75.

04:21.933 --> 04:23.233
$75,000?

04:23.267 --> 04:24.468
How about 300?

04:24.502 --> 04:26.636
$300,000?

04:26.671 --> 04:28.605
- 150.
- They'll do it.

04:28.639 --> 04:30.159
Ah, thank you.
That is such a relief.

04:30.174 --> 04:31.608
I love my nephew very much,

04:31.642 --> 04:32.743
but he's
a horrible little tyrant,

04:32.777 --> 04:34.745
so don't ruin this day for him!

04:34.779 --> 04:37.013
150 bucks?

04:37.048 --> 04:38.748
Split that four ways, boom.

04:38.783 --> 04:41.184
$600.

04:41.219 --> 04:43.086
I'll say it again:
The men's room needs

04:43.121 --> 04:45.288
a separate dispenser
for face wash.

04:45.323 --> 04:47.090
I can't wash my face
with hand soap.

04:47.125 --> 04:48.825
Look at these pores.
They're gaping.

04:48.860 --> 04:50.627
- Hey, guys.
- Time-out.

04:50.661 --> 04:52.462
Let's take a brief recess.

04:52.497 --> 04:53.797
Can we help you, Ann?

04:53.831 --> 04:56.099
I was looking for Leslie,
but now I'm curious

04:56.134 --> 04:57.894
why you guys are sitting
around doing nothing

04:57.902 --> 04:59.369
and getting drunk at work.

04:59.404 --> 05:01.071
It's the whine & cheese club,
gorgeous.

05:01.105 --> 05:02.572
It's a monthly gathering

05:02.607 --> 05:03.607
where we all get together
and vent

05:03.641 --> 05:04.808
about what annoys us at work.

05:04.842 --> 05:07.411
Over fine wines and cheeses,
of course.

05:07.445 --> 05:08.512
Larry, salami!

05:08.546 --> 05:11.014
The human resources department

05:11.049 --> 05:13.683
requires that I be available
once a month

05:13.718 --> 05:17.421
to discuss workplace disputes
with my employees.

05:17.455 --> 05:18.922
The rules do not specify

05:18.956 --> 05:20.290
whether or not
I'm allowed to listen

05:20.324 --> 05:23.627
to Willie Nelson
on my headphones.

05:23.661 --> 05:26.163
And Kyle parked his car
in my spot again.

05:26.197 --> 05:27.798
Now, that is the fourth time
this month.

05:27.832 --> 05:29.399
♪ Hello, walls

05:29.434 --> 05:31.835
- ♪ Hello
- ♪ Hello

05:31.869 --> 05:36.039
♪ how'd things go
for you today? ♪

05:36.074 --> 05:38.141
I just want to choke him
until he passes out.

05:38.176 --> 05:39.336
- Time.
- This looks like fun.

05:39.343 --> 05:40.777
I want to try.

05:40.812 --> 05:41.845
Mm, there's rules to this,
sweet pea.

05:41.879 --> 05:42.846
It's Donna's turn next.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.347
I'll cede my time to Ann.

05:44.382 --> 05:45.949
I have a feeling
this is gonna be good.

05:45.983 --> 05:47.150
Okay, well, I'm not gonna talk
for long,

05:47.185 --> 05:48.785
'cause I have to pee again,

05:48.820 --> 05:50.153
'cause I have to pee
every six minutes,

05:50.188 --> 05:52.289
'cause I have a beach ball
in my stomach

05:52.323 --> 05:53.356
that's punching on my bladder.

05:53.391 --> 05:55.125
That sucks.

05:55.159 --> 05:57.527
I know.
And I'm never not hungry.

05:57.562 --> 05:59.629
- Oh, well, have some cheese.
- I can't have cheese, Larry!

05:59.664 --> 06:00.864
And I can't have wine either.

06:00.898 --> 06:02.399
I can't have anything good.

06:02.433 --> 06:05.302
You know, what I can have
is liquefied flaxseed.

06:05.336 --> 06:07.070
But I don't want that.
You know what I want?

06:07.105 --> 06:08.872
Pork rinds.
I want jelly beans.

06:08.906 --> 06:11.708
And I want a huge trash bag
filled with mashed potatoes.

06:11.743 --> 06:13.076
I want to be Pac-Man,

06:13.111 --> 06:15.112
and instead of dots,
I want 'em to be cinnamon buns.

06:15.146 --> 06:17.447
I want to be a giant head
and a mouth,

06:17.482 --> 06:20.283
and I just want to eat rows
and rows of junk food pellets,

06:20.318 --> 06:23.020
and where's my trash bag
of potatoes?

06:26.791 --> 06:28.225
Time.

06:28.259 --> 06:29.259
Yikes.

06:29.293 --> 06:31.528
Okay, Harrison Ford
movie night.

06:31.562 --> 06:33.363
Before we do that,
I was thinking more

06:33.397 --> 06:34.731
about that chard guy.

06:34.766 --> 06:36.400
I mean, it would be very easy
for you to revoke

06:36.434 --> 06:37.534
their license.

06:37.568 --> 06:40.404
Okay, Leslie,
this is city business,

06:40.438 --> 06:41.638
and I'm not an emperor.

06:41.672 --> 06:43.540
I can't just kick them out
for no reason.

06:43.574 --> 06:45.442
The reason is
it's vegetable porn.

06:45.476 --> 06:46.743
Porn on the cob.

06:46.778 --> 06:48.178
I'm sorry.
I'm just very good at that.

06:48.212 --> 06:49.646
Look, I am not a prude,

06:49.681 --> 06:50.914
but the point is,

06:50.948 --> 06:52.282
people shouldn't be half naked,

06:52.316 --> 06:54.051
you know, in public,
in the middle of the day,

06:54.085 --> 06:55.185
in front of children.

06:55.219 --> 06:57.120
There's your reason.
Kick them out.

06:57.155 --> 06:59.923
Look, now that
we're working together again,

06:59.957 --> 07:02.826
maybe it would be good
to keep our home life

07:02.860 --> 07:04.795
and our work life separate.

07:04.829 --> 07:06.863
Like we only talk
about work stuff

07:06.898 --> 07:08.131
when we're at city hall,

07:08.166 --> 07:10.467
like a firewall system.

07:10.501 --> 07:12.502
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
That's smart.

07:12.537 --> 07:14.071
Home is home, and work is work.

07:14.105 --> 07:15.906
We can always talk about this
tomorrow at the office.

07:15.940 --> 07:17.874
Good.
Glad you agree.

07:17.909 --> 07:18.875
All right.

07:18.910 --> 07:21.211
<i>Crystal Skull</i> it is.

07:21.245 --> 07:23.480
No, it's ridiculous
to think that you could survive

07:23.514 --> 07:26.116
a nuclear blast
by jumping into a refrigerator.

07:26.150 --> 07:27.484
- Mm-hmm, yeah, uh-huh.
- But still, it's like--

07:27.518 --> 07:29.419
Okay, so I found
a legal precedent

07:29.454 --> 07:31.388
to shut down
those vegetable smut peddlers.

07:31.422 --> 07:32.823
What is happening?

07:32.857 --> 07:33.890
Firewall, man.

07:33.925 --> 07:35.325
We pulled into the parking lot,

07:35.359 --> 07:37.394
and this is technically
city hall property,

07:37.428 --> 07:39.062
so now we're at work--
let's do this.

07:39.097 --> 07:41.398
The farmers market is
a community meeting place,

07:41.432 --> 07:42.933
and that pan-sexual
stripper show

07:42.967 --> 07:44.568
basically negates
the whole purpose.

07:44.602 --> 07:46.303
So if you're looking
for a reason to kick them out,

07:46.337 --> 07:47.971
here's 158.

07:48.005 --> 07:49.873
The new farmers market
rule book.

07:49.907 --> 07:51.675
Okay, when did you make this?

07:51.709 --> 07:52.909
I stayed up all night.

07:52.944 --> 07:54.811
I also made these--

07:54.846 --> 07:56.813
Leslie's toffee surprise.

07:56.848 --> 07:59.483
The surprise is there's toffee
in the inside.

07:59.517 --> 08:01.184
You can eat those
once you revoke

08:01.219 --> 08:03.086
the chard vendor's license.

08:03.121 --> 08:04.988
Good day, colleague.

08:05.022 --> 08:06.823
Okay.

08:09.730 --> 08:11.429
Ann Perkins!
How are you feeling?

08:11.464 --> 08:12.464
You don't want to know.

08:12.465 --> 08:14.232
It's all I want to know.

08:14.267 --> 08:16.134
All right, man,
you asked for it.

08:16.169 --> 08:17.435
I have shooting pains
that go all the way up

08:17.470 --> 08:18.803
from my butt to my neck.

08:18.838 --> 08:20.305
My stomach has
so many stretch marks on it

08:20.339 --> 08:21.807
that it looks like
an old-fashioned globe.

08:21.841 --> 08:23.308
My boobs are getting
really sore.

08:23.342 --> 08:24.709
Also, I just read
Brooke Shields' book

08:24.744 --> 08:25.944
on post-partum depression.

08:25.978 --> 08:29.581
Now I have pre-post-partum
depression anxiety.

08:29.615 --> 08:30.982
Well, never fear.

08:31.017 --> 08:32.616
I will get you Tylenol
for your pain

08:32.652 --> 08:34.085
and shea butter for your belly.

08:34.120 --> 08:35.320
And your voluptuous figure

08:35.354 --> 08:36.755
only means your body is working

08:36.789 --> 08:38.957
exactly as nature intended it.

08:38.991 --> 08:41.025
There, it's all good.
Is that better?

08:41.059 --> 08:42.159
Yeah. Thanks.

08:42.195 --> 08:43.515
I've been reading up
on nipples.

08:43.529 --> 08:45.263
The reason that you're feeling
nipple sensitivity

08:45.298 --> 08:46.865
is because your milk ducts
in your nipples

08:46.899 --> 08:47.999
are opening up,

08:48.034 --> 08:50.468
which is why I bought you
this nipple kit.

08:50.503 --> 08:51.803
It's from Kernsten's--
the nipple people.

08:51.838 --> 08:53.972
It has nipple cream,
nipple pads,

08:54.006 --> 08:55.907
and also a special
nipple pimple ointment

08:55.942 --> 08:57.943
in case you develop
any pimples on your nipples.

08:57.977 --> 09:01.179
Oh, my God, you have to stop
using the word "nipple."

09:01.214 --> 09:02.447
Okay. Anyway.

09:02.482 --> 09:04.182
Hopefully that will help you
with any sensitivity

09:04.217 --> 09:07.786
that may arise around your...

09:07.820 --> 09:09.554
boob hats.

09:09.589 --> 09:10.956
Larry, get in there!
Come on!

09:10.990 --> 09:12.390
What do--I don't even know
what we're doing.

09:12.425 --> 09:14.125
What is the meaning
of this, nurse?

09:14.160 --> 09:15.660
Emergency whine & cheese club.

09:15.695 --> 09:16.862
Put your headphones on, Ron.

09:16.896 --> 09:17.896
I have a lot of complaints.

09:17.930 --> 09:19.898
Sit down.
I need to vent.

09:19.932 --> 09:22.234
And do not
under any circumstances

09:22.268 --> 09:23.235
respond to anything I say.

09:23.269 --> 09:24.369
All right.

09:24.403 --> 09:26.371
Let's talk about vomit, kids.

09:26.405 --> 09:28.206
I do it all day long.

09:28.241 --> 09:30.041
♪ Super fun

09:30.076 --> 09:31.776
♪ it feels super good

09:31.811 --> 09:35.080
♪ I wanna do it all the time

09:35.114 --> 09:38.750
♪ sex is cool

09:38.784 --> 09:41.019
Okay, <i>Sex Is Cool.</i>
<i>Got that.</i>

09:41.053 --> 09:43.822
I say we finish
on <i>Drunk Off Our Asses.</i>

09:43.856 --> 09:46.324
And I think we should do
<i>Sex in Space.</i>

09:46.359 --> 09:48.226
It's 20 minutes long,
but it's really good.

09:48.261 --> 09:50.462
Babe, I don't think you should
play any of those songs

09:50.496 --> 09:51.663
for a group of six-year-olds.

09:51.697 --> 09:53.565
Whoa, wait--
six-year-olds?

09:53.599 --> 09:55.367
Did you book us a gig
at a kids' party?

09:55.401 --> 09:57.102
You said we were playing
at a festival.

09:57.136 --> 09:58.503
You said Dave Grohl
might be there.

09:58.538 --> 10:01.006
Dave Grohl might be there.
I don't know.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.307
He might be anywhere.

10:02.341 --> 10:04.075
The guy's awesome,
and he's unpredictable.

10:04.110 --> 10:06.311
No, no, I'm not playing
for a bunch of screaming kids.

10:06.312 --> 10:08.446
Mouse Rat is a rock band.
We're not the Wiggles.

10:08.481 --> 10:09.648
Come on!

10:09.682 --> 10:11.616
I'm sick of all the drama
with this band.

10:11.651 --> 10:12.751
I-I quit.

10:12.785 --> 10:14.119
I'm going
back to rabbinical school.

10:15.188 --> 10:16.254
Umbilical school?

10:16.289 --> 10:17.355
Rivers, come back.

10:17.390 --> 10:19.057
Rivers, don't do this.
Hey!

10:19.091 --> 10:21.426
Shaq might be there!

10:21.461 --> 10:22.727
Hey, did you get a chance

10:22.762 --> 10:24.563
to sign off
on that booklet I gave you?

10:24.597 --> 10:26.765
Well, I read it,
but it seems like

10:26.799 --> 10:28.300
your farmers market rules

10:28.334 --> 10:30.702
may be specifically targeting
chardbodies.

10:30.736 --> 10:32.871
What? How?

10:32.905 --> 10:34.606
"No visible cleavage.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.041
"No strobe lights.

10:36.075 --> 10:37.742
No chard-related innuendo."

10:37.777 --> 10:39.377
Those apply to all vendors.

10:39.412 --> 10:40.478
Either way, it's too late.

10:40.513 --> 10:42.314
The train has left the station.

10:42.348 --> 10:44.115
Okay, what train,
from which station?

10:44.150 --> 10:45.483
- You're revoking my license?
- Oh, boy.

10:45.518 --> 10:47.485
Yes, Nolan, under the auspices

10:47.520 --> 10:48.787
of the office of city manager,

10:48.821 --> 10:50.121
et cetera, et cetera,
it's not important,

10:50.156 --> 10:52.124
you are in violation
of many rules,

10:52.158 --> 10:53.792
and therefore you cannot sell
your goods anymore

10:53.826 --> 10:54.926
at the Pawnee farmers market.

10:54.961 --> 10:57.596
Ben, back me up on this
without hesitation.

10:57.630 --> 10:59.397
Nolan, can I have a second
to speak with my w--

10:59.432 --> 11:01.500
with Ms. Knope
for a second?

11:01.534 --> 11:02.901
Look, chard is disgusting.

11:02.935 --> 11:04.669
You try selling it
without sexy dancers.

11:04.704 --> 11:05.770
It's impossible.

11:05.805 --> 11:07.205
It's like,
"Hey, you like lettuce?

11:07.240 --> 11:08.507
"Try this. It's worse.

11:08.541 --> 11:10.408
It tastes like kale
took a dump on spinach."

11:10.418 --> 11:12.019
I like to think of it
as celery with B.O.

11:12.044 --> 11:13.311
But if it's so gross,

11:13.346 --> 11:14.579
you should just sell
something else.

11:14.614 --> 11:15.814
I inherited this farm
from my dad.

11:15.848 --> 11:16.915
It's all I have.

11:16.949 --> 11:17.983
Plus, the other vendors
want me there.

11:18.017 --> 11:19.117
I'm good for business.

11:19.152 --> 11:20.752
We're not revoking
your license.

11:20.786 --> 11:21.887
For now.

11:21.921 --> 11:24.055
I am sorry you had to come in.

11:24.090 --> 11:25.257
Judas!

11:25.291 --> 11:27.359
I don't appreciate
being ambushed, Leslie.

11:27.393 --> 11:28.927
- Let's just go home.
- No.

11:28.961 --> 11:30.028
I know what
you're trying to do.

11:30.062 --> 11:31.329
If we go home,
the firewall is up,

11:31.364 --> 11:32.531
and then you don't have to deal
with me anymore.

11:32.565 --> 11:34.432
Instead, fellow employee,

11:34.467 --> 11:36.568
I will meet you
in the basement conference room

11:36.602 --> 11:37.869
at 6:00 P.M.,

11:37.904 --> 11:39.738
and we will solve
this chard issue

11:39.772 --> 11:40.839
once and for all.

11:40.873 --> 11:42.507
Don't forget your approval pen.

11:42.542 --> 11:43.775
What?
There's no such thing.

11:43.810 --> 11:45.110
Yes, there is.

11:45.144 --> 11:47.946
I made it for you last night.

11:47.980 --> 11:50.215
Ugh, and Lamaze class,

11:50.249 --> 11:51.850
wait till I tell you
about that Ponzi scheme.

11:51.884 --> 11:53.285
Ugh.

11:53.319 --> 11:54.953
Oh, hey, Donna, what the hell?

11:54.987 --> 11:57.722
You know I can't be
around smoke or fatty tuna.

11:57.757 --> 11:58.757
Ron--

11:58.791 --> 11:59.991
At first, this was funny,

12:00.026 --> 12:00.992
but it's gotten out of hand.

12:01.027 --> 12:02.294
This was our chance

12:02.328 --> 12:04.963
to vent about work,
and you've taken it over.

12:04.997 --> 12:06.064
Yeah!

12:06.098 --> 12:07.666
It's sushi and cigar club now.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.234
Wow. Okay.

12:09.268 --> 12:11.837
I see how it is.

12:11.871 --> 12:13.171
I feel bad.

12:13.206 --> 12:14.739
I don't.
This is a Cuban.

12:14.774 --> 12:16.408
This is yellowtail.
I feel amazing.

12:16.442 --> 12:18.577
Whoa!
Monster in the window!

12:18.611 --> 12:20.011
You know what
my biggest complaint is?

12:20.046 --> 12:22.180
I have a million things
I need to complain about,

12:22.215 --> 12:23.482
and I can't take them home
because Chris is

12:23.516 --> 12:25.016
the most considerate person
in the world,

12:25.051 --> 12:26.172
and he just wants to help me,

12:26.185 --> 12:27.425
and then I feel bad about that,

12:27.453 --> 12:29.221
and then I get annoyed
that he wants to help me,

12:29.255 --> 12:30.422
and I feel even worse
about that!

12:30.456 --> 12:31.756
I thought you guys
would be cool

12:31.791 --> 12:33.091
with me complaining
'cause it's all you do,

12:33.126 --> 12:35.994
is sit here and complain
without judgment or guilt.

12:36.028 --> 12:37.548
But you know what?
I guess I was wrong.

12:37.563 --> 12:38.930
And you know what?
I would yell some more,

12:38.965 --> 12:42.100
but I think I just peed
my pants a little bit.

12:42.135 --> 12:43.435
What's happening now?

12:43.469 --> 12:44.870
Is the nurse upset?

12:44.904 --> 12:46.872
I don't care.

12:46.906 --> 12:48.974
Okay, 6:00.
Let's do this.

12:49.008 --> 12:50.041
Larry?

12:50.076 --> 12:51.443
Mm. Hey, Leslie.

12:51.477 --> 12:52.477
Ben couldn't make it,

12:52.512 --> 12:54.212
so he asked me
to read you this.

12:54.247 --> 12:55.881
"Dear honey--"
Oh, how sweet.

12:55.915 --> 12:57.682
- Read.
- Oh.

12:57.717 --> 12:59.597
"Sorry, but I think we just need
to take a break

12:59.619 --> 13:00.719
"from this work issue.

13:00.753 --> 13:01.987
"Please don't grind your teeth
too hard

13:02.021 --> 13:03.455
"when you hear this.
I will see you in the car.

13:03.489 --> 13:04.456
I love you."

13:04.490 --> 13:05.557
Oh, that is so sweet

13:05.591 --> 13:07.025
that you still write
love letters to--

13:10.563 --> 13:11.796
What the hell
are you doing out here?

13:11.831 --> 13:14.299
Sorry, babe.
I am off city hall property.

13:14.333 --> 13:15.767
You have to stop.

13:15.802 --> 13:16.768
Firewall.

13:16.803 --> 13:17.769
Wrong.

13:17.804 --> 13:18.837
All roads and bridges

13:18.871 --> 13:20.138
fall under the purview

13:20.173 --> 13:21.439
of the Pawnee department
of transportation,

13:21.474 --> 13:23.742
which is located on
the fourth floor of city hall.

13:23.776 --> 13:25.377
Firewall down.

13:25.411 --> 13:27.579
Stay frosty, Wyatt.

13:27.613 --> 13:28.880
We're just getting started.

13:29.293 --> 13:31.048
Okay, well, that's interesting.

13:31.168 --> 13:31.998
You know why?

13:32.118 --> 13:34.653
- Why?
- Because--

13:34.687 --> 13:36.154
Mother--

13:39.228 --> 13:40.194
Ha-ha!

13:40.228 --> 13:41.996
Bank! Private property.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.531
Firewall restored!

13:43.565 --> 13:44.598
Ha-ha-ha!

13:44.633 --> 13:45.799
The concrete
that you're standing on

13:45.834 --> 13:48.969
was poured by a municipal
construction crew.

13:51.907 --> 13:53.207
Private fountain,

13:53.241 --> 13:54.208
private property.

13:54.242 --> 13:55.209
I'm safe.

13:55.243 --> 13:56.911
Guess where the water
comes from.

13:56.945 --> 14:00.614
The Pawnee reservoir.

14:00.649 --> 14:03.217
You can't escape
city hall, fool!

14:03.251 --> 14:06.720
Let's dance.

14:07.989 --> 14:09.056
Hey, friends.

14:09.090 --> 14:10.357
I'm just about to go
on my night jog.

14:10.392 --> 14:11.458
Would you like to join me?

14:11.493 --> 14:12.860
Mm, hard pass.

14:12.894 --> 14:15.062
We're here because you need
to tend to your woman.

14:15.096 --> 14:16.497
She's complaining
about everything,

14:16.531 --> 14:17.998
ruining whine & cheese club.

14:18.033 --> 14:19.700
I literally have
1,000 questions.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.468
Why is Ron wearing headphones?

14:21.503 --> 14:22.584
What's whine & cheese club?

14:22.604 --> 14:23.871
And what is Ann
complaining about?

14:23.905 --> 14:25.506
You, mostly--
how you never let her vent

14:25.540 --> 14:26.840
because you're always too busy

14:26.875 --> 14:28.236
trying to solve
everything for her.

14:28.243 --> 14:29.810
She's upset that I'm trying
to help her?

14:29.845 --> 14:32.580
You've fallen into a classic
trap, Christopher--

14:32.614 --> 14:34.682
trying to fix
a woman's problems

14:34.716 --> 14:36.684
instead of just listening
to what they are!

14:36.718 --> 14:37.918
Why are you yelling?

14:37.953 --> 14:40.855
Tom put all my records
into this rectangle!

14:40.889 --> 14:42.690
Hey, man, if Ann needs Tylenol,

14:42.724 --> 14:43.824
she can get it herself.

14:43.858 --> 14:45.226
What she needs from you

14:45.260 --> 14:46.827
is to just look her
in the eyes,

14:46.862 --> 14:49.463
nod your head, and say
those two magic words.

14:49.497 --> 14:51.665
"That sucks."

14:51.700 --> 14:53.100
"That sucks"?

14:53.134 --> 14:54.368
I spent my entire life

14:54.402 --> 14:55.836
reading instructional books
about relationships

14:55.871 --> 14:57.705
in order to trick women
into liking me.

14:57.739 --> 14:59.206
When Ann tells you
what's bothering her,

14:59.241 --> 15:00.441
don't try to fix it.

15:00.475 --> 15:02.009
Just say,

15:02.043 --> 15:04.278
"Damn, that sucks."

15:04.312 --> 15:05.746
The songs just play

15:05.780 --> 15:07.348
one right after the other!

15:07.382 --> 15:10.251
This is an excellent rectangle!

15:14.256 --> 15:15.356
Okay, this is insane.

15:15.390 --> 15:16.857
It is 40 degrees,

15:16.892 --> 15:18.459
and we are standing
in freezing water.

15:18.493 --> 15:19.760
No, this is our motivation.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.295
We are not leaving
this fountain

15:21.329 --> 15:23.230
until we've figured this out
once and for all.

15:23.265 --> 15:24.985
Fine. Why are you
not supporting me on this?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.300
I thought you agreed with me.

15:26.334 --> 15:28.402
I do, as a person,

15:28.436 --> 15:29.904
but as city manager,

15:29.938 --> 15:32.206
I'm not 100% sure
you have a case.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.141
You're not listening
to my side.

15:34.176 --> 15:35.242
I mean, sometimes when we
disagree,

15:35.277 --> 15:36.677
you're so passionate,

15:36.711 --> 15:38.546
I feel like I'm arguing
with the sun.

15:38.580 --> 15:39.947
What? That is totally crazy!

15:39.981 --> 15:43.817
I am super chill all the time!

15:43.852 --> 15:46.487
Look, let's just admit it.
We're in a weird position.

15:46.521 --> 15:48.289
We're married.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.890
Our professional status has
flipped, like, five times.

15:49.925 --> 15:51.892
I mean, now I'm your boss.

15:51.927 --> 15:54.562
This is "un-charded" territory
for us.

15:54.596 --> 15:56.764
Oh, that's nice.

15:56.798 --> 15:58.999
Thanks.
I learned from the best.

15:59.034 --> 16:00.067
The point is,

16:00.101 --> 16:01.769
forget firewalls.

16:01.803 --> 16:05.172
Let's just be respectful
and communicate,

16:05.207 --> 16:06.941
and we'll find
the right balance.

16:06.975 --> 16:08.475
You're right.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.511
I should have considered
your side.

16:10.545 --> 16:11.946
I love you,

16:11.980 --> 16:14.982
and you're also
a very smart person.

16:17.352 --> 16:18.752
Let's get out of this fountain.

16:18.787 --> 16:20.187
I can't because my legs
are numb.

16:20.222 --> 16:21.755
Yeah, I can't move.
Are we gonna die here?

16:21.790 --> 16:22.923
Yeah.

16:22.958 --> 16:24.959
No, don't do that.

16:24.993 --> 16:26.026
I don't like this game.

16:26.061 --> 16:27.127
I don't know
what the rules are!

16:27.162 --> 16:28.596
Okay, babe, here's what I did.

16:28.630 --> 16:30.364
Tell me if this is appropriate
for a kids' song.

16:30.398 --> 16:33.300
I changed the lyrics
in <i>Sex Hair</i> to...

16:33.335 --> 16:35.502
♪ You got sex bears

16:35.537 --> 16:37.605
♪ you got 'em from me, kids

16:37.639 --> 16:38.973
♪ sex bears

16:39.007 --> 16:39.974
♪ big ol' sex bears

16:40.008 --> 16:41.642
Andy, the word "hair"

16:41.676 --> 16:44.111
was not the problem
with <i>Sex Hair.</i>

16:44.146 --> 16:46.780
Oh, it's sex!
Oh, crap.

16:46.815 --> 16:48.015
Now what the hell
am I supposed to sing?

16:48.049 --> 16:49.583
It's time, Andrew.

16:49.618 --> 16:50.851
These kids are tearing
my house apart,

16:50.886 --> 16:52.319
and I need you to calm them
with the power of song.

16:52.354 --> 16:53.387
Oh, gosh,
here's the thing--

16:53.421 --> 16:54.555
I can't do it.

16:54.589 --> 16:55.689
I got laryngitis.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.192
You will not bail on me,
Andrew Dwyer.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.527
You <i>will</i> perform.

16:59.561 --> 17:00.995
My nephew is something
of an outcast in his school,

17:01.029 --> 17:02.797
and I got Erica Swarvane
to come,

17:02.831 --> 17:03.864
which is a huge get.

17:03.899 --> 17:05.132
She rules the first grade.

17:05.165 --> 17:06.567
And this party will determine
his social status

17:06.601 --> 17:08.402
for the next hundred years!

17:08.435 --> 17:10.637
So you better get out there,
or I am going to lose it!

17:10.672 --> 17:11.972
Have you not lost it?

17:12.007 --> 17:13.440
Oh, you don't even know!

17:13.474 --> 17:15.309
Babe, I'm freaking out.

17:15.343 --> 17:16.443
Listen to me.

17:16.478 --> 17:18.179
You make up songs all the time

17:18.213 --> 17:19.213
off the top of your head.

17:19.214 --> 17:20.548
You do.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.215
You can do this,
and afterwards,

17:22.250 --> 17:23.651
we can have cake.

17:23.685 --> 17:25.685
I already had cake.

17:25.720 --> 17:27.188
Andy!

17:28.323 --> 17:30.324
Okay, focus up,
you little monsters!

17:30.358 --> 17:31.992
Not you, Erica.
You're an angel,

17:32.027 --> 17:33.227
and we're thrilled you're here.

17:33.228 --> 17:35.029
Now, is everyone ready to hear

17:35.063 --> 17:36.530
the best music
you've ever heard

17:36.565 --> 17:38.399
in your miserable little lives?

17:38.433 --> 17:39.867
No!

17:39.901 --> 17:42.203
Okay, then,
ladies and gentlemen,

17:42.237 --> 17:44.071
please welcome--

17:44.105 --> 17:46.740
what even do you call yourself?

17:46.775 --> 17:48.509
- Yeah, I--
- Oh, it's too late!

17:48.543 --> 17:51.245
Please welcome Johnny Karate

17:51.279 --> 17:54.482

He's doing it!

18:29.985 --> 18:31.018
You're picking your nose,

18:31.052 --> 18:32.212
and you put it on your friend!

18:32.220 --> 18:34.522
Ha-ha, I started that.

This is so fun.

19:13.295 --> 19:16.063
I cannot believe
this only cost me 150 bucks.

19:17.710 --> 19:19.343
Oh, hey.
How was your day?

19:19.377 --> 19:21.011
It was okay.

19:21.352 --> 19:22.453
Now my legs really hurt.

19:22.487 --> 19:23.754
It's like I have
a tension headache,

19:23.788 --> 19:25.122
but in my calves.

19:25.156 --> 19:28.091
A new surprise every day.

19:28.126 --> 19:29.726
That sucks.

19:29.761 --> 19:31.228
I know.

19:31.262 --> 19:32.729
And I'm so gassy.

19:32.764 --> 19:35.399
There's just been, like,
a long, slow fart stream

19:35.433 --> 19:37.568
coming out of me
since we started talking...

19:37.602 --> 19:38.602
this morning.

19:38.636 --> 19:40.070
That really sucks.

19:40.105 --> 19:43.974
Yeah. It does.

19:44.008 --> 19:46.910
Thanks.

19:46.945 --> 19:49.446
I'm sorry that I was trying
to fix all your problems.

19:49.481 --> 19:51.915
Oh, God, don't apologize.

19:51.950 --> 19:54.318
I'm sorry I was such a freak.

19:54.352 --> 19:56.954
You're the nicest,
most thoughtful baby daddy

19:56.988 --> 20:00.357
a girl could ask for.

20:00.391 --> 20:01.859
That was incredible.

20:01.893 --> 20:04.094
You are overflowing with talent,
and I admire you.

20:04.128 --> 20:05.362
- Oh.
- Excuse me.

20:05.396 --> 20:07.164
- Mr. Karate?
- Mr. Karate!

20:07.198 --> 20:09.133
My son wants you to sing
at his birthday party

20:09.167 --> 20:11.001
next weekend.

20:11.035 --> 20:12.369
- Are you available?
- He is,

20:12.404 --> 20:14.972
but it's actually $250
for short notice.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.140
You can call this number

20:16.174 --> 20:18.275
and ask for April Karate.

20:18.309 --> 20:19.443
Yes, I will.

20:19.477 --> 20:21.011
- Babe...
- Oh, my God.

20:21.046 --> 20:22.346
That was amazing.

20:22.380 --> 20:24.782
I kind of think you can make
a career out of this.

20:24.816 --> 20:26.817
But, I mean, I don't know.

20:26.851 --> 20:29.052
W-what does that make me--
a kids' performer?

20:29.087 --> 20:30.621
I'm supposed to be a rock star.

20:30.655 --> 20:32.523
You just had fun in there
and made $150.

20:32.557 --> 20:34.892
Who cares about what you were
supposed to be?

20:34.926 --> 20:36.226
- Yeah.
- Plus, you have never been

20:36.261 --> 20:37.594
sexier to me
than when you were singing

20:37.629 --> 20:38.695
to those kids just now.

20:38.730 --> 20:39.696
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:39.731 --> 20:41.498
Well, that's weird.

20:42.567 --> 20:43.834
Nolan, I'm very sorry

20:43.868 --> 20:45.636
that I overreacted
and overstepped my bounds.

20:45.670 --> 20:46.737
I understand.

20:46.771 --> 20:47.838
When I got into the chard game,

20:47.872 --> 20:49.807
I knew I'd ruffle
some feathers.

20:49.841 --> 20:51.675
Sure. I'm just glad
that we could all come

20:51.709 --> 20:52.876
to an agreement.

20:52.911 --> 20:55.579
All right, everybody,
it is now 5:00 P.M.,

20:55.613 --> 20:57.481
which means the farmers market
is closed.

20:57.515 --> 20:59.583
And farmers market after dark

20:59.617 --> 21:02.219
is open for business!

21:06.758 --> 21:08.058
Well, if this is the way

21:08.092 --> 21:09.772
people want to buy
their produce, so be it.

21:09.794 --> 21:12.496
This town is full of lunatics.

21:16.434 --> 21:17.534
Ugh!

21:17.569 --> 21:19.089
Oh, my God,
this was a terrible idea.

21:19.104 --> 21:22.039
Yeah, it's like a tree
barfed in my mouth.

21:22.073 --> 21:23.748
Bleh.
