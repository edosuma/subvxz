00:03.103 --> 00:04.171
Aunt Hilda,
what's going on?

00:04.171 --> 00:06.006
I came over as soon
as I got your message.

00:06.006 --> 00:06.640
It's Zelda.

00:06.640 --> 00:09.776
She and Professor Carlin
broke up-- for good this time.

00:09.776 --> 00:11.945
At least that's what it sounded
like through the keyhole.

00:11.945 --> 00:15.015
Oh,poor Aunt Zelda,
she must be devastated.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.116
Whoa. ( <i>sniffing</i> )

00:16.116 --> 00:17.484
What is that delicious smell?

00:17.484 --> 00:21.088
That, my dear, is the
sweet smell of heartbreak.

00:21.088 --> 00:24.157
Every time Zelda has
a really horrific
breakup, she cooks.

00:24.157 --> 00:25.526
Well, that sounds
like a sensible way

00:25.526 --> 00:27.294
to deal
with an emotional crisis.

00:27.294 --> 00:28.695
Oh, hi, Sabrina.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.731
I made appetizers.

00:31.231 --> 00:32.099
Go ahead, take two.

00:32.099 --> 00:33.634
They're small.

00:35.469 --> 00:36.436
Mutton?

00:36.436 --> 00:39.640
Unfortunately, she's had
the same breakup menu
for the last 400 years.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.810
And the more upset she is,
the bigger the spread.

00:43.810 --> 00:44.811
She seems pretty upbeat.

00:44.811 --> 00:46.914
Maybe she's not as upset
as you think.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.616
Dinner is served.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.355
Okay, maybe
she is upset.

00:55.355 --> 00:58.625
And I need to pull out
my big jeans.

01:03.063 --> 01:09.036

01:41.034 --> 01:43.070
And make sure you leave room
for dessert.

01:43.070 --> 01:45.706
I made my specialty:
honeyed calf marrow.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.574
( <i>gasping</i> ):
In a cup or a cone?

01:47.574 --> 01:49.443
Aunt Zelda, look,
are you okay?

01:49.443 --> 01:51.578
I heard about your breakup
with Professor Carlin.

01:51.578 --> 01:52.713
Oh, please.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.481
Getting rid of Arthur
is the best thing

01:54.481 --> 01:56.383
I could ever have done.

01:56.383 --> 01:57.784
And now that the
last decent man

01:57.784 --> 02:00.887
on the planet wants absolutely
nothing to do with me,

02:00.887 --> 02:02.522
I'm free to return
to the carefree,

02:02.522 --> 02:04.958
fabulous life of a single woman.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.159
( <i>sobbing</i> ):
Try the haggis

02:06.159 --> 02:07.728
while it's still warm.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.764
I feel so bad
for Aunt Zelda.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.432
We can't just sit here
and gorge ourselves

02:12.432 --> 02:13.934
while she's in there
crying her eyes out.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.469
Sure we can.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.603
Dibs on the snout.

02:16.603 --> 02:18.438
Fine, but I get the ears.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.076
( <i>cauldrons bubbling)</i>
( <i>sobbing</i> )

02:23.477 --> 02:23.977
Oh, no.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.346
Aunt Zelda, don't cry.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.115
Well, you're right.

02:28.115 --> 02:29.950
I'm making
the gruel salty.

02:29.950 --> 02:30.884
Oh, that's okay.

02:30.884 --> 02:33.186
It'll cut the sweetness
from the calf marrow.

02:33.186 --> 02:34.054
I just want to say that

02:34.054 --> 02:35.789
I don't like the way
Professor Carlin treated you.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.858
Oh, this isn't
just about Arthur.

02:37.858 --> 02:42.396
<i>(sniffles)</i> It's about the
monumental mess
I've made of my love life.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.196
Yeah, Aunt Hilda said

02:43.196 --> 02:45.232
you've done a lot of
cooking over the years.

02:45.232 --> 02:46.400
It's true.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.067
But it's not the men

02:47.067 --> 02:49.369
who walked away from me
that I'm upset about.

02:49.369 --> 02:53.240
It's the man I walked
away from-- Gabriel.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.174
The archangel?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.942
No, that was Hilda's squeeze.

02:55.942 --> 02:57.878
My Gabriel was a poet.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.513
A free-spirited witch

02:59.513 --> 03:02.649
who asked me to run away
with him, get married,

03:02.649 --> 03:04.985
climb the Himalayas,
travel the Galaxy.

03:04.985 --> 03:05.719
( <i>sniffles</i> )

03:05.719 --> 03:09.056
Like a fool, I said no,
sent him on his merry way.

03:09.056 --> 03:10.891
Why? He sounds so perfect.

03:10.891 --> 03:14.261
Or is "merry" a euphemism
for something?

03:14.261 --> 03:15.595
Oh, I was a young lass

03:15.595 --> 03:17.998
and thought my work
and my research

03:17.998 --> 03:20.634
were more important than love.

03:20.634 --> 03:24.104
Saying no to Gabriel
was my biggest regret.

03:24.104 --> 03:25.706
Here, look.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.876
This was taken just before
he asked me to marry him.

03:29.876 --> 03:33.013
Wow! He's like
a total babe.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.114
Look at this guy.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.949
I can't believe you let such
a gorgeous hunk get away.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.250
( <i>crying</i> )

03:39.519 --> 03:41.288
Okay, well, I guess
I can scratch therapist

03:41.288 --> 03:43.023
off my list of career options.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.225
Muttonloaf?

03:45.225 --> 03:46.159
You can cross
sandwich maker

03:46.159 --> 03:48.895
off your list of
career options.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.998
Hey, did you take
this picture?

03:51.998 --> 03:53.734
Oh, yeah.
They're so sweet.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.168
She broke up with him
in high school,

03:55.168 --> 03:57.437
but he carried a torch for her
for almost 60 years

03:57.437 --> 03:59.439
until they found
each other again.

03:59.439 --> 04:01.074
All that wasted time.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.743
Yeah. Isn't it amazing
how one decision

04:02.743 --> 04:04.611
can change your entire life?

04:04.611 --> 04:06.346
I mean, what if they had
gotten together back then?

04:06.346 --> 04:08.014
Well, she would have spent
the last 60 years

04:08.014 --> 04:10.383
as Mrs. Henry Hungerdunger.

04:10.383 --> 04:11.151
Yeah, and we'd be reading

04:11.151 --> 04:13.687
about all the great times
they had together.

04:13.687 --> 04:16.189
Wow, if you could
only change the past.

04:16.189 --> 04:17.758
But you can't.

04:18.191 --> 04:19.659
Maybe <i>you</i> can't.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.027
Got to go.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.497
There's got to be something
on this magic CD-ROM

04:23.497 --> 04:25.599
to change Aunt Zelda's past.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.933
Oh, I can't imagine
going through life

04:26.933 --> 04:28.969
with a giant regret
hanging over my head.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.505
Hey, I regret
not invading Iceland

04:31.505 --> 04:34.708
when I had the chance, but you
don't hear me bellyaching.

04:35.308 --> 04:36.042
If I could just
go back in time

04:36.042 --> 04:37.310
I could-convince
her to say "yes"

04:37.310 --> 04:40.447
instead of "no" and all her
problems would be solved.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.715
There's got to be a way.

I know just the thing.

Hey, Zellie, you got
any more homemade brew?

05:21.288 --> 05:23.790
It's frabulous.

05:25.025 --> 05:28.695
I want to go back to the moment
this picture was taken.

05:28.695 --> 05:29.396
No problem.

But first I'm required

05:32.666 --> 05:33.433

or the altering of the

05:34.734 --> 05:35.502
Time travelers have been known

to experience nausea, vomiting
and premature hair loss.

Tax and license not included.

05:39.539 --> 05:41.474
Your biggest worry
will be the fallout

05:41.474 --> 05:44.578
if Zelda discovers you've been
messing around with her life.

05:44.578 --> 05:47.380
Well, she's not exactly thrilled
with the way it's going now.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.349
Besides, she doesn't need
to know about it.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.350
Anything else?

05:50.350 --> 05:51.585
Just keep your
hands and arms

05:51.585 --> 05:53.086

06:04.998 --> 06:07.234
oh, what a view.

06:11.905 --> 06:14.307
Oh, Gabriel, that was inspired.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.576
One guess who inspired it.

06:16.576 --> 06:17.677
( <i>beatnik</i>
<i>clears throat</i> )

06:17.677 --> 06:19.846
Hey, man, I'm doing
a <i>Life Magazine</i> layout

06:19.846 --> 06:21.081
on up-and-coming poets.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.883
How about a shot of
you and your lady?

06:27.153 --> 06:28.154
Whew!

06:28.154 --> 06:29.489
That Web site guy was right.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.458
Time travel does
make you nauseous.

06:31.458 --> 06:35.262
Zelda, there's something
I have to ask you.

06:35.262 --> 06:37.664
Oh, it's natural, all right.

06:37.664 --> 06:40.600
No. Something much deeper.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.435
I want us
to roam the Galaxy

06:42.435 --> 06:44.371
explore the stars

06:44.371 --> 06:46.306
the sea
and the sand;

06:46.306 --> 06:48.108
take each day as it comes

06:48.108 --> 06:49.175
together.

06:49.175 --> 06:50.977
Zelda Spellman

06:50.977 --> 06:52.812
I love you.

06:52.812 --> 06:54.848
Will you marry me?

06:54.848 --> 06:58.551
Oh, Gabriel,
I love you, too.

06:58.551 --> 06:59.252
But what about
my work, my...

06:59.252 --> 07:00.754
Aunt Zelda, wait!

07:00.754 --> 07:01.655
Before you say anything...

07:01.655 --> 07:02.756
I beg your pardon.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.392
Did you just call me
"Aunt" Zelda?

07:05.392 --> 07:07.294
Duh. Haven't
been born yet.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.396
Uh, I meant it
in that, you know

07:09.396 --> 07:12.132
"Hey, Daddio," "Hey, Auntio"
hepcat sort of way.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.100
So, what can I get
you crazy kids?

07:14.100 --> 07:14.801
Uh,would you excuse
us?

07:14.801 --> 07:15.902
We're in the middle of something

07:15.902 --> 07:16.736
kind of important here.

07:16.736 --> 07:18.738
And what is more important
than nourishment?

07:18.738 --> 07:20.173
besides marrying
your soul mate.

07:20.173 --> 07:23.310
So, if you are lucky enough
to find that person, hint, hint.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.278
I suggest taking him up
on that offer

07:25.278 --> 07:26.780
and trying the shrimp salad.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.182
It's enough for three.
Trust me.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.284
You're absolutely right.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.621
Gabriel, I will marry you.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.588
And dressing on the side.

07:36.356 --> 07:41.594
Zelda, you have made me the
happiest man in the world.

07:41.594 --> 07:42.896
Woo-hoo!

07:45.832 --> 07:47.434
Well, that went well.

07:48.368 --> 07:49.336
Oh, weird.

07:49.336 --> 07:53.006
Time travel makes you nauseous
and hungry.

07:57.410 --> 08:00.613
All I'm saying is,
the hair is a little retro.

08:00.613 --> 08:02.449
The whole Cher thing
has to go.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.751
And all I'm saying is,
I'm not taking fashion advice

08:04.751 --> 08:06.720
from a woman who dresses
like a giant pink rabbit

08:06.720 --> 08:08.254
to go to Chem lab.

08:08.254 --> 08:09.122
SABRINA:
Hey, guys.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.924
How old is this cheese?

08:10.924 --> 08:13.393
Excuse me.
Who are you?

08:13.393 --> 08:15.929
And why are your grubby hands
all over my string cheese?

08:15.929 --> 08:16.463
Sorry.

08:16.463 --> 08:17.230
Since when did you get

08:17.230 --> 08:19.399
so possessive
about your dairy products?

08:19.399 --> 08:23.003
Since I saw a complete stranger
rummaging through my fridge.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.538
I'm not a stranger;
I'm your roommate Sabrina.

08:25.538 --> 08:29.042
Right! And I'm
Lady Bird Johnson.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.143
MILES:
Hey, who's
the chick?

08:30.143 --> 08:32.779
And how come she's
allowed to touch
your cheese?

08:32.779 --> 08:35.882
Wait a minute. None
of you know who I am?

08:37.283 --> 08:41.921
Well... then I-I guess
I should probably, you know

08:41.921 --> 08:43.957
go check out something
on my computer!

08:43.957 --> 08:45.592
Stop her!

08:46.559 --> 08:47.627
Ooh!

08:47.827 --> 08:49.863
Okay, there's got to be
a simple explanation.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.664
I'll just log
onto that Web site and...

08:51.664 --> 08:52.265
( <i>pounding on door</i>
<i>and shouting</i> )

08:52.265 --> 08:55.168
Hey, where's my computer?

08:55.168 --> 08:56.202
Where's all my stuff?

08:56.202 --> 08:59.739
We're busting this door
down three, two, one!

09:03.676 --> 09:05.578
She's gone.

09:05.578 --> 09:06.846
God, that felt great.

09:06.846 --> 09:08.748
I've always dreamt
of kicking in a door.

09:08.748 --> 09:12.052
And since I did the kicking,
you can keep on dreaming.

09:12.519 --> 09:14.287
Okay, don't panic.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.923
I'll just slip in,
grab my magic book

09:16.923 --> 09:19.025
and make sense
of what's going on.

09:19.025 --> 09:23.163
Which would be a lot easier
if my key fit the lock.

09:23.763 --> 09:25.198
I thought I heard
someone at the door.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.667
Sabrina, what
are you doing?

09:28.168 --> 09:30.336
Oh, you know, I just
came over to say "hi"

09:30.336 --> 09:32.672
and grab a couple of
things from my old room.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.607
Hey, where's the piano?

09:34.607 --> 09:36.643
Sabrina, are
you. all right?

09:36.643 --> 09:37.911
Yeah, I'm fine.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.780
Really? Because we've
never had a piano

09:40.780 --> 09:43.817
and you don't have a room
here, old or otherwise.

09:43.817 --> 09:47.053
Okay, this is house number two
I've never lived in.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.090
Sabrina! Always a delight
to see you in our home.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.025
Well, something
worked out right.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.193
You are married, right?

09:53.193 --> 09:55.261
Of course. We've
been married for years.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.063
Huh, no need
to thank me.

09:57.063 --> 09:58.231
Why would we?

09:58.231 --> 09:59.532
Something's
definitely
wrong with her.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.634
She also thinks she
used to live here.

10:01.634 --> 10:02.502
Oh, this is what happens

10:02.502 --> 10:05.071
when you eat a whole can
of frosting for breakfast.

10:05.071 --> 10:06.306
( <i>laughs</i> )

10:06.306 --> 10:08.408
So, refresh my memory

10:08.408 --> 10:10.844
which isn't as good
as it used to be.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.779
Where would I
find Aunt Hilda?

10:12.779 --> 10:14.948
Sabrina, now you're
really scaring me, dear.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.783
You live with
Hilda and Salem.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.352
God, I hate
that smug pottymouth.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.820
And I'm not crazy
about the cat, either.

10:20.820 --> 10:21.688
Gabriel.

10:21.688 --> 10:22.856
Sorry.

10:22.856 --> 10:23.490
Would you excuse me?

10:23.490 --> 10:25.825
I'm hosting a salon.

10:26.759 --> 10:28.595
Today they're discussing
which came first:

10:28.595 --> 10:29.996
the poet or the rhyme.

10:29.996 --> 10:32.265
Oh, well, I'm waiting
for the movie.

10:32.265 --> 10:35.335
Okay, well, I'll let you two
get back to your domestic bliss

10:35.335 --> 10:38.071
and I'll just go to my place.

10:38.505 --> 10:42.475
You wouldn't happen to know
the address, would you?

10:43.943 --> 10:44.978
Well, the key fits

10:44.978 --> 10:49.215
so, unfortunately,
this must be home.

10:49.215 --> 10:50.517
Finally.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.719
You know, you forgot to fold
up your cot this morning.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.120
Why are you dressed
like that?

10:54.120 --> 10:55.688
Trying to class up
the act a little.

10:55.688 --> 10:57.924
Salem's idea.
He's a genius.

10:57.924 --> 10:59.792
You're a ventriloquist?

10:59.792 --> 11:00.960
Of course I am.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.128
Yup.

11:02.128 --> 11:04.197
And me and my dummy are going
straight to the top.

11:04.197 --> 11:07.000
That is, if my dummy'd
quit moving her lips

11:07.000 --> 11:08.835
and let me do the talking.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.436
If I don't move my lips

11:10.436 --> 11:12.272
people will think
I'm not doing anything.

11:12.272 --> 11:15.141
And that, Einstein,
would be the act.

11:15.141 --> 11:16.242
( <i>rumbling</i> )

11:16.242 --> 11:18.211
Whoa! What's going on?!

11:18.211 --> 11:19.512
( <i>train passes</i> )
Why are we living
in a dump?!

11:19.512 --> 11:21.014
Hey, what are you
complaining about?

11:21.014 --> 11:23.016
You've got a roof
over your head.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.120
More or less.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.788
Oh! I don't get
any of this.

11:28.788 --> 11:31.691
I mean, I'm supposed
to be in college.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.859
( <i>laughs</i> )

11:32.859 --> 11:34.861
Yeah, right.
Between your grades

11:34.861 --> 11:38.031
and what a ventriloquist
brings home, I don't think so.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.700
Aunt Hilda, there's something
I have to tell you.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.834
Look,I went back in time

11:41.834 --> 11:44.204
I convinced Aunt Zelda
to marry Gabriel

11:44.204 --> 11:45.772
and screwed up everything.

11:45.772 --> 11:46.406
What?

11:46.406 --> 11:47.707
This isn't our real life.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.742
In reality, Aunt Zelda
didn't marry Gabriel.

11:49.742 --> 11:50.910
We all lived together.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.046
And you were very happy,
owned a successful business

11:53.046 --> 11:55.014
and were dating the
president of a university.

11:55.014 --> 11:57.584
And no one considered the cat
the brains of the operation.

11:57.584 --> 11:58.651
She's lying.

11:58.651 --> 12:01.788
You inflicted this life on me?

12:02.589 --> 12:05.191
Yes, but I'm sure
I can get it back.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.259
Well, I'm pretty sure.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.927
I just have to get back
on that Web site.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.362
Now,where's your computer?

12:09.362 --> 12:11.064
Oh, I sent it out
to get detailed

12:11.064 --> 12:12.465
along with my Rolls Royce.

12:12.465 --> 12:15.101
Hey, Hildie, chop chop,
it's show time!

12:15.101 --> 12:17.470
Oh, right.
Now, if you'll
excuse me

12:17.470 --> 12:21.941
Salem and I are booked at the
Off-Ramp Inn on Route 17.

12:21.941 --> 12:24.377
We're opening for Carrot Top.

12:26.145 --> 12:28.681
Where am I going to
find a computer?

12:32.285 --> 12:33.453
Hi.

12:33.453 --> 12:34.420
There you are.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.855
I was getting
worried about you.

12:35.855 --> 12:36.856
Ah, thank goodness!

12:36.856 --> 12:38.524
I know this isn't going
to make any sense to you

12:38.524 --> 12:39.892
but I don't know
what I would have done

12:39.892 --> 12:42.262
if you didn't know
who I was. Hold me!

12:42.262 --> 12:43.630
Josh, what's going on?

12:43.630 --> 12:46.165
No idea. I said "hi"
and the chicken

12:46.165 --> 12:47.800
delivery girl
kind of freaked out.

12:47.800 --> 12:48.801
Delivery girl?

12:48.801 --> 12:50.436
Yeah, and where's
our 12-piece combo?

12:50.436 --> 12:51.871
We've been waiting
over an hour.

12:51.871 --> 12:54.173
Oh, my God,
I'm a chicken delivery girl?

12:54.173 --> 12:55.842
And a really bad one.

12:55.842 --> 12:59.178
Let's just grab something
across the street.

12:59.178 --> 13:01.214
I swear, I don't
even know her.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.916
All of a sudden,
she just started pawing at me.

13:05.051 --> 13:06.886
Ok, I guess the lesson here is

13:06.886 --> 13:09.789
in the future
I won't change the past.

13:14.093 --> 13:16.195

13:24.437 --> 13:25.872
What do you mean,
"out of business"?

13:25.872 --> 13:27.273
You can't do this to me!

13:27.273 --> 13:29.575
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Calm down, blondie.

13:29.575 --> 13:32.679
We had to close down because
of unforeseen complications.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.247
Oh, let me guess,
changing the past

13:34.247 --> 13:36.015
destroyed all of
your customers' lives?

13:36.015 --> 13:37.684
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

13:37.684 --> 13:38.851
What am I supposed to do now?

13:38.851 --> 13:39.986
Well, you could visit me

13:39.986 --> 13:43.356
at my new website
www.usedcauldrons.com.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.359
We've got some super deals
on brand name pots. We've
got--!

13:46.793 --> 13:50.530
Great. There's got to be some
way to get my old life back.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.032
Or at least figure out
who I am in this life.

13:53.032 --> 13:55.034
Hey, what are you looking at?

13:55.034 --> 13:57.070
Apparently, I'm kind of rude.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.905
Sabrina,
there you are.

13:58.905 --> 13:59.639
Harvey.

13:59.639 --> 14:02.075
You know your behavior
is totally unacceptable.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.843
When I agreed to hire you
at the Chicken Shack

14:03.843 --> 14:05.812
you and your probation
officer promised me

14:05.812 --> 14:07.013
you'd clean up your act.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.181
I'm on probation?

14:08.181 --> 14:10.483
And you're the manager
at the Chicken Shack?

14:10.483 --> 14:12.985
Assistant Manager.
But I'm still your boss.

14:12.985 --> 14:13.786
Now put your hat on.

14:13.786 --> 14:14.921
I don't have a...

14:14.921 --> 14:16.489
Oh, should've
seen that coming.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.191
We aren't by any chance
dating, are we?

14:18.191 --> 14:19.359
Come on, Sabrina

14:19.359 --> 14:22.528
you know the Chicken
Shack frowns upon that.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.131
Well, if you know me
and Josh knows me

14:25.131 --> 14:27.166
then maybe I could just
recreate my old life

14:27.166 --> 14:28.735
and it'll be like
nothing ever happened.

14:28.735 --> 14:29.936
I don't care what you do

14:29.936 --> 14:32.271
as long as you do it
in the Chicken Mobile.

14:33.639 --> 14:35.541
( <i>knocking on door</i> )

14:36.943 --> 14:38.544
Hi, it's me again.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.580
You must have a death wish.
What are you doing back here?

14:40.580 --> 14:42.448
Well, we seem
to have gotten off
on the wrong foot.

14:42.448 --> 14:43.850
And I thought maybe
we could start fresh

14:43.850 --> 14:45.418
over a bucket of thighs.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.286
I'll take an
explanation instead.

14:47.286 --> 14:49.188
What do you want?
Nothing.

14:49.188 --> 14:51.557
I just thought, you know,
maybe we could be friends.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.193
Maybe I could enroll
at Adams, move in here

14:54.193 --> 14:55.361
and, who knows,
maybe my presence

14:55.361 --> 14:56.863
would bring us all
a little closer together.

14:56.863 --> 14:58.464
It might if you reveal
the secret recipe

14:58.464 --> 15:00.733
of your 11 herbs
and spices.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.835
Well, believe me,
I would if I could.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.704
But I just want to say that

15:04.704 --> 15:06.739
I really, really
like you guys.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.007
And if you don't take me in

15:08.007 --> 15:09.742
I'll be forced
to live by the railroad tracks

15:09.742 --> 15:13.146
with my ventriloquist aunt
and her smart-mouthed cat.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.548
Okay, I think we have
a situation here.

15:15.548 --> 15:16.582
Just back away
from the chicken

15:16.582 --> 15:18.851
and no one will get hurt.

15:19.285 --> 15:21.921
Would this have gone any better
if I had brought gravy?

15:22.188 --> 15:23.956
...so I says to the guy

15:23.956 --> 15:27.160
that's no alley cat,
that's my mother.

your lips again.

going to take a little break.

Anybody want to buy me a drink?

15:42.341 --> 15:43.943
This is your act?

15:43.943 --> 15:45.178
You should've been here
for our first set.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.245
One guy was on the floor.

15:46.245 --> 15:48.781
He was having a heart attack.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.583
So, any luck getting
our old lives back?

15:50.583 --> 15:52.118
Well,you've got your
hand up a cat's butt,

15:52.118 --> 15:53.719
and I'm running
around town in a paper hat.

15:53.719 --> 15:54.587
What do you think?

15:54.587 --> 15:56.422
Hey! You're the one
who altered history.

15:56.422 --> 15:58.257
I'm sorry, I know
this is all my fault.

15:58.257 --> 15:59.826
I just can't figure
a way out of it.

15:59.826 --> 16:02.862
I can only think of
one person who could
possibly fix things

16:02.862 --> 16:04.397
but she and I
don't really speak.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.032
Who's that?
Your Aunt Zelda.

16:06.032 --> 16:06.566
We haven't gotten along

16:06.566 --> 16:08.267
since the day
she and that poet--

16:08.267 --> 16:10.503
<i>(guffaws)</i>
yeah, right--
got married.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.338
Every time you
say something,
I feel worse.

16:12.338 --> 16:14.841
Welcome to my world.

16:14.841 --> 16:16.008
I guess we have
no choice.

16:16.008 --> 16:17.944
We're just going to have
to tell Zelda what you did.

16:17.944 --> 16:20.179
But if we tell her,
then she'll find out
that her perfect life

16:20.179 --> 16:22.615
is just the result of
a magical contrivance.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.484
We can't ask her to give
up her happiness for us.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.184
Why not?

16:25.184 --> 16:28.254
Look,there' s got to
be a way for Aunt Zelda to keep
her perfect life

16:28.254 --> 16:29.555
and for us
to get ours back.

16:29.555 --> 16:31.591
If I could just get my
hands on a magic book.

16:31.591 --> 16:32.725
Zelda's got tons of them.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.994
We'll go right after
we finish our next set.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.596
Go now.

16:36.596 --> 16:37.697
We'll go now.

and restraining orders.

Unreasonable?

16:46.906 --> 16:48.774
Since when is it
unreasonable

16:48.774 --> 16:50.109
to want to spend
an evening alone?

16:50.109 --> 16:51.244
Zelda, please.
Our guests.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.446
Guests? Don't you
mean leeches?

16:53.446 --> 16:55.181
I am sick and tired
of waiting on you

16:55.181 --> 16:57.416
and your pathetic posse
of parasitic poets.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.151
Leave the alliteration
to the professionals.

16:59.151 --> 17:01.521
"Professional" implies
you actually get paid
for what you do.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.190
Oh, it always comes down
to money, doesn't it?

17:04.190 --> 17:06.659
It does when one of us
has to work three jobs

17:06.659 --> 17:07.660
in order to support us.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.929
You wanted to marry
an artist.

17:09.929 --> 17:11.364
Yeah, a con artist.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.266
You promised
to show me the galaxy.

17:13.266 --> 17:16.502
The closest I've gotten is
the inside of your Ford Galaxie.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.404
And even then, you brought
your stupid friends.

17:18.404 --> 17:19.906
What are you saying,
you regret marrying me?

17:19.906 --> 17:22.275
Every single day of my life.

17:22.275 --> 17:22.842
Well, you did

17:22.842 --> 17:24.243
and now you're
stuck with me.

17:24.243 --> 17:25.478
So, could you hurry
dinner along?

17:25.478 --> 17:27.880
The boys are getting
a little peckish.

17:28.180 --> 17:31.517
Oh, well, look who's here.

17:31.517 --> 17:33.853
Don't stand out in the cold.

17:35.688 --> 17:36.856
Well, well, well.

17:36.856 --> 17:38.724
Look what the cat dragged in.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.326
Oh, hi.

17:40.326 --> 17:43.162
You know, I really enjoyed
your last book of poetry.

17:43.162 --> 17:44.931
Though I would've
enjoyed even more

17:44.931 --> 17:47.233
if they'd published it
on two-ply.

17:50.169 --> 17:51.270
Aunt Zelda,
this is perfect.

17:51.270 --> 17:53.606
I know exactly how to get you
out of your horrible marriage--

17:53.606 --> 17:55.508
which is kind of my fault
to begin with.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.510
I don't know what
you're talking about.

17:57.510 --> 18:00.513
Gabriel and I have
never been happier.

18:00.513 --> 18:03.549
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have guests.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.351
Happy?

18:05.351 --> 18:07.286
What does she takes us
for, complete idiots?

18:07.286 --> 18:09.355
SALEM:
<i>(takes a deep breath)</i>
Not a word.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.157
Clearly she's in denial.

18:11.157 --> 18:12.825
Do you know where she
keeps her magic books?

18:12.825 --> 18:13.826
In the front hall.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.595
And can you distract
a roomful of poets?

18:15.595 --> 18:16.295
Easy.

18:16.295 --> 18:19.098
With your clothes on?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.333
Oh.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.804
...and so I says to the guy

18:24.804 --> 18:28.541
that's no alley cat,
that's my mother.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.811
Time... time...

18:31.811 --> 18:33.980
Time in a bottle."

18:33.980 --> 18:35.214
Time.

18:35.214 --> 18:37.350
"Subscribe to <i>Time</i> magazine."

18:37.350 --> 18:39.018
"Time travel!" Perfect.

18:39.018 --> 18:40.553
Going somewhere?
No!

18:40.553 --> 18:41.087
I mean, I wasn't.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.889
I was, uh, you know,
I lost my keys, I thought...

18:43.889 --> 18:45.825
I really don't think
time travel is something

18:45.825 --> 18:48.594
you want to play
around with, Sabrina.

18:48.594 --> 18:51.764
Believe me, you're
preaching to the choir.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.203
Hey, have any of you ever heard
my impression

18:57.203 --> 18:59.905
of Gabriel's "poetry?"

19:00.272 --> 19:02.108
This isn't part of the act.

19:02.108 --> 19:04.510
It's called
"Ode to a Big Fat Ego."

19:04.577 --> 19:06.979
I think that I shall never see

19:06.979 --> 19:09.115
Someone as talentless as me

19:09.115 --> 19:12.218
Oh, others may be mediocre...

19:12.218 --> 19:14.920
Ooh, she rhymed herself
into a corner there.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.155
"Mediocre."

19:16.155 --> 19:19.191
Excuse me while
I go and choke her.

19:19.191 --> 19:21.961
You and I
aren't finished.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.030
Oh, yes, we are.

19:24.030 --> 19:26.198
I need to mend the present
and return to the past.

19:26.198 --> 19:27.967
If I don't get my old life back

19:27.967 --> 19:30.636
I'll spend my days
at the Chicken Shack.

19:30.636 --> 19:32.872
Whew, talk about bad poetry.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.710
Zelda Spellman, I love you.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.145
Will you marry me?

19:39.145 --> 19:42.548
Oh, Gabriel,
I love you, too.

19:42.548 --> 19:43.616
But what about my work...

19:43.616 --> 19:45.818
No, wait!
Don't do it.

19:45.818 --> 19:46.952
Look, I know
you don't know me--

19:46.952 --> 19:49.021
well, you might,
it's hard to keep track--

19:49.021 --> 19:51.257
but I'm begging you,
see him for who he really is.

19:51.257 --> 19:52.391
He's a user.

19:52.391 --> 19:54.326
He'll never live up
to any of his promises.

19:54.326 --> 19:56.595
Your life and everyone else's
life will be miserable.

19:56.595 --> 19:59.065
Besides that,
he's really an awful poet.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.167
I was going to say
"no" anyway.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.769
But thanks for your support,
whoever you are.

20:03.769 --> 20:04.870
You're welcome.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.073
Carry on, then.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.011
Sabrina, hi.
What's going on?

20:12.011 --> 20:13.045
Honey, are you all right?

20:13.045 --> 20:14.080
I'm not sure yet.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.082
Are you now, or have
you ever been married?

20:16.082 --> 20:18.984
No.
Oh, I'm so
happy for you!

20:18.984 --> 20:20.786
I'm guessing
spell gone awry.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.254
Look,I know you're upset
about Professor Carlin

20:22.254 --> 20:23.089
but I just want you to know

20:23.089 --> 20:25.558
that you made the right
decision about Gabriel.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.226
Oh, I'm sure I did.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.360
You are?

20:28.360 --> 20:30.062
But what about all the
regrets you had yesterday

20:30.062 --> 20:31.464
about not marrying him?

20:31.464 --> 20:34.567
Oh, well, every time
a relationship ends

20:34.567 --> 20:36.402
I think of Gabriel.

20:36.402 --> 20:39.638
And then I remember
the bad poetry, the hangers-on

20:39.638 --> 20:42.708
and the fact that he always
"forgot" his wallet.

20:42.708 --> 20:44.977
Thank God I didn't end up
with that deadbeat.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.212
Loser.

20:46.212 --> 20:49.648
And you couldn't have
told me all this yesterday?

20:49.648 --> 20:51.917
Well, you didn't ask.

20:58.057 --> 21:00.092
Hi, I'm home.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.627
What are you doing here?

21:01.627 --> 21:03.062
Oh, for the love of...

21:03.062 --> 21:04.764
Look, you're just going
to have to believe me, okay?

21:04.764 --> 21:06.398
My name is Sabrina,
I'm your roommate.

21:06.398 --> 21:08.267
We're friends.
I go to college here.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.568
We work together
at the coffee house.

21:09.568 --> 21:11.437
I don't deliver chicken
nor have I ever.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.838
Is that clear?

21:12.838 --> 21:14.507
Perfectly.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.175
But I still don't know
what you're doing here.

21:16.175 --> 21:20.246
You were supposed to meet
Josh at the coffee house
20 minutes ago.

21:20.246 --> 21:21.981
Oops.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.883
Never mind.

21:23.883 --> 21:24.950
Got to go.

21:27.319 --> 21:28.721
And people think
I'm the ditzy one.
