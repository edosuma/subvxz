WEBVTT

00:05.306 --> 00:07.408
Alison:
THIS IS HOW I HEARD THE STORY.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.281
THE TWINS PLAYED SO NICELY
WHILE THEY WAITED

00:13.314 --> 00:15.349
FOR THEIR PARENTS
TO GET HOME.

00:23.224 --> 00:27.228
BUT THEY WOULDN'T GET TO
GO TRICK-OR-TREAT THAT NIGHT...

00:33.334 --> 00:35.836
...OR EVER AGAIN.

00:35.869 --> 00:40.241
ALISON! HE'S GONNA GO HOME
AND TELL HIS PARENTS THE STORY
AND I'M GONNA GET FIRED.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.243
COME ON, HANNA,
HE LOVES IT.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.612
RIGHT?

00:44.645 --> 00:46.214
YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.

00:46.247 --> 00:49.683
SHE LIFTED THE KNIFE
HIGH INTO THE AIR,

00:49.717 --> 00:53.187
AND THEN PLUNGED IT
DEEP INTO HER SISTER'S CHEST!

00:56.757 --> 00:59.493
A SICK SMILE
CAME ACROSS HER FACE

00:59.527 --> 01:04.063
AS SHE WATCHED THE BLOOD
OOZE OUT OF HER SISTER'S HEART.

01:08.436 --> 01:11.405
AND THEY HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO SEND HER AWAY

01:11.439 --> 01:14.742
TO A HOME FOR
THE CRIMINALLY INSANE.

01:14.775 --> 01:17.145
AND THAT'S WHERE
SHE REMAINED

01:17.178 --> 01:19.447
UNTIL...YESTERDAY

01:19.480 --> 01:23.217
WHEN SHE ESCAPED
AND VOWED RETURN TO ROSEWOOD

01:23.251 --> 01:27.588
AND STAB TO DEATH EVERY CHILD
WHO DARES TO GO
TRICK-OR-TREATING ON HALLOWEEN!

01:27.621 --> 01:28.789
AAAAH!

01:30.791 --> 01:33.261
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT *

01:33.294 --> 01:35.663
* SWEAR THIS ONE YOU'LL SAVE

01:35.696 --> 01:38.199
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

01:38.232 --> 01:40.768
* TAKIN' THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

01:40.801 --> 01:45.706
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU
 WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID *

01:45.739 --> 01:50.911
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

01:50.944 --> 01:52.446
( thunder crashes )

02:00.788 --> 02:05.159
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, EM?
SHOULD HANNA BE "CUTE BRITNEY"

02:05.193 --> 02:06.860
OR "BALD BRITNEY"?

02:06.894 --> 02:10.264
IF SHE WANTS TO BE,
CUTE BRITNEY.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.700
ARIA?

02:12.733 --> 02:16.404
SHE'S NOT GONNA
SHAVE HER HEAD.

02:16.437 --> 02:19.940
SPENCER, YOU'RE WORSE
THAN MY FATHER.
SORRY.

02:19.973 --> 02:23.311
BUT I DID JUST PROCURE
NINE VOTES FROM THE DEBATE TEAM.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.646
WAIT, THAT'S
A GOOD THING, RIGHT?

02:25.679 --> 02:29.317
YEAH. AND "PROCURED" MEANS TO
OBTAIN WITH SPECIAL EFFORT.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.951
AND "OBTAIN" MEANS TO--

02:30.984 --> 02:33.687
ARE YOU GONNA RECITE
THE ENTIRE DICTIONARY?

02:33.721 --> 02:37.625
I THINK THAT HANNA SHOULD BE
WHO SHE WANTS TO BE.

02:37.658 --> 02:41.429
FINE. BUT YOU BETTER WEAR
THE TIGHTEST SKINNY PANTS

02:41.462 --> 02:43.931
YOU CAN FIT
YOUR BIG BUTT INTO.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.299
( text ding )

02:45.333 --> 02:46.767
BEN?

02:46.800 --> 02:48.969
HE'S ALL ABOUT ME GOING
AS A SEXY COP FOR HALLOWEEN.

02:49.002 --> 02:52.306
BUT I'M THINKING INDIAN GIRL.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.942
( rocks music plays
on car stereo )

02:58.879 --> 03:00.381
WHAT A SHAME.

03:00.414 --> 03:03.384
ALL THAT TESTOSTERONE
AND NOT A SHEEP IN SIGHT.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.586
CAREFUL, ALISON.
I GET YOUR JOKES,

03:05.619 --> 03:08.622
BUT SOMEDAY YOU MIGHT
MEET A GUY WHO DOESN'T.

03:12.460 --> 03:15.596
SO AM I GONNA SEE YOU
AT MY PARTY ON FRIDAY?

03:15.629 --> 03:18.532
UM, I DIDN'T KNOW
WE WERE INVITED.

03:18.566 --> 03:21.402
YOUR ALI'S FRIENDS, RIGHT?
( horn honks )

03:21.435 --> 03:23.504
COME PREPARED
TO BE SCARED.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.842
DID WE JUST GET INVITED
TO NOEL KAHN'S HALLOWEEN BASH?

03:28.876 --> 03:31.345
I'M A LITTLE EMBARRASSED
BY HOW EXCITED YOU GIRLS ARE.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.547
IT'S JUST A PARTY.
ALI, IT'S NOT JUST A PARTY.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.383
IT'S THE PARTY.

03:35.416 --> 03:39.320
YOU'RE RIGHT. AND I'M HAPPY
WE'LL BE THERE TOGETHER.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.489
( all giggling )

03:46.794 --> 03:48.862
WE SHOULD
GET READY TOGETHER.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.931
SPENCE, YOU'VE GOT
THE BIGGEST BEDROOM,
LET'S HAVE IT THERE.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.700
IS THAT COOL?
YEAH.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.335
OKAY.
HOLD UP.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.769
I THINK THERE'S
SOMEBODY IN THERE.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.807
ARE YOU JUST
TRYING TO SCARE US?

03:59.840 --> 04:01.909
NO, I SWEAR, I JUST
SAW SOMEONE IN THE WINDOW.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.678
WELL, KIDS GO IN THERE
ALL THE TIME AROUND HALLOWEEN.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.614
IT'S LIKE A RITE PASSAGE
IN THIS TOWN.

04:10.784 --> 04:13.487
I WISH THEY'D JUST
TEAR THIS PLACE DOWN ALREADY.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.423
EVERY TIME I WALK BY HERE
I GET THE CREEPS.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.558
IT'S JUST AN UGLY
OLD HOUSE, ARIA.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.361
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
I JUST...

04:20.394 --> 04:23.531
I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING
REALLY BAD HAPPENED HERE.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.399
THERE'S NOBODY
IN THERE.

04:25.433 --> 04:26.534
COME ON.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.797
ARE YOU MOVING?

04:59.066 --> 05:01.935
MY DAD GOT MARRIED AGAIN.
THEY'RE MOVING IN.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.505
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

05:04.538 --> 05:07.375
IT HASN'T BEEN THAT LONG
SINCE YOUR MOM--

05:09.910 --> 05:12.346
IT WAS A YEAR AGO LAST WEEK.

05:15.749 --> 05:18.819
YOU SAID "THEY."
DOES SHE HAVE
ANY KIDS?

05:20.721 --> 05:22.890
A DAUGHTER.

05:25.626 --> 05:28.362
WHAT'S SHE LIKE?

05:28.396 --> 05:31.031
SHE GETS WHAT SHE WANTS.

05:38.005 --> 05:42.042
( rock music plays
over sound system )

06:06.133 --> 06:07.401
DAMNIT!

06:07.435 --> 06:08.569
NOEL!

06:08.602 --> 06:10.738
ADMIT IT.
YOU WERE SCARED.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.706
YOU NEED TO BRING THAT
TO HALLOWEEN.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.476
I'LL BRING A LOT MORE
THAN THAT.
GOOD.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.765
LADY G?

06:37.798 --> 06:40.568
I WASN'T GONNA DRESS UP
THIS YEAR,

06:40.601 --> 06:43.571
BUT I GOT INVITED
TO SOME PARTY, SO...

06:43.604 --> 06:44.805
WHOSE PARTY?

06:44.838 --> 06:46.507
UH, NOEL SOMEBODY.

06:46.540 --> 06:49.142
NOEL KAHN.
I'LL BE THERE.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.512
AND I'M GOING AS LADY G.
OH.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.781
SHE'S SO NEW,
I THOUGHT I WAS
BEING ORIGINAL.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.749
YOU STILL HAVE TIME
TO PICK SOMETHING ELSE.

06:55.783 --> 06:58.886
HMM. YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.488
MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.655
I KNOW WHO YOU'LL BE.

07:01.689 --> 07:04.592
AND YOU'LL SURPRISE ME.

07:07.561 --> 07:10.531
OH.
I'M ALISON.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.633
I KNOW.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.535
I'M JENNA.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.941
( phone beeps )

07:41.762 --> 07:43.463
FREAK!

07:47.735 --> 07:50.638
MY GRANDMOTHER
WAS A SWEATER MODEL.
I LOOK LIKE HER.

07:52.540 --> 07:55.976
OF COURSE, SHE'S OLD NOW
AND SHE SMELLS TERRIBLE.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.612
BUT I DON'T HAVE TO SEE HER MUCH
'CAUSE SHE LIVES IN GEORGIA.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.249
MY TURN.

08:02.282 --> 08:05.919
HMM. IT'S HD, SO...

08:05.953 --> 08:08.756
THE IMAGE IS PERFECT,
RIGHT?

08:08.789 --> 08:10.157
I LIKE WHAT I SEE.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.227
IT'S PERFECT, SPENCE,

08:14.261 --> 08:17.030
IT'S GOT HUMOR, HEART,
IT'S INSPIRING--

08:17.064 --> 08:18.999
I WISH I COULD BE THERE
TO HEAR IT.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.535
WOW, SPENCE, YOU GOT
MELISSA'S STAMP OF APPROVAL.

08:21.569 --> 08:24.004
MUST BE A GOOD SPEECH.
WELL, IT BETTER BE.

08:24.037 --> 08:27.174
MY PARENTS ARE ALREADY PLANNING
MY VICTORY PARTY.

08:27.207 --> 08:30.310
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU'VE GOT
A PERFECT OLDER SISTER.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.981
NO, ALISON, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU'RE A HASTINGS.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.783
I DIDN'T MAKE THE RULES.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.650
BESIDES, SPENCER
DESERVES TO WIN.

08:37.684 --> 08:41.121
HER AGENDA IS TOP-NOTCH.
THANKS, MELISSA.

08:41.154 --> 08:45.859
HMM.
IT'S COMFORTING TO KNOW
THAT SPENCER CAN COUNT ON YOU.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.828
SO, MELISSA,
DID YOU TELL SPENCE

08:47.861 --> 08:49.697
WHAT WE DECIDED ON
FOR HALLOWEEN?

08:49.730 --> 08:52.032
BONNIE AND CLYDE.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.834
COOL.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.608
OH. SORRY.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.721
HE'S IN A MEETING.

09:14.988 --> 09:18.792
OH. YEAH, I WAS JUST
LEAVING HIM A NOTE.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.967
AH. YES, I FORGOT
MY BRIEFCASE AGAIN.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.170
YEAH. MOM SAW IT
IN THE KITCHEN.

09:32.205 --> 09:35.108
OH. HEY, MEREDITH.
DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE HERE.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.711
I NEEDED A QUITE PLACE TO READ.
HOPE THAT'S OKAY.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.747
SURE.

09:39.780 --> 09:43.016
SO, UM, WANT TO GRAB
A COFFEE OR SOMETHING?

09:43.050 --> 09:45.919
I CAN'T. I PROMISED MOM
I'D BE HOME FOR DINNER.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.254
OKAY.

09:47.287 --> 09:50.791
WELL,
SEE YOU IN CLASS.
SURE.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.897
HMM.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.265
WHAT'S HER STORY?

09:58.298 --> 10:01.201
STUDENTS CRASH HERE
ALL THE TIME.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.270
'CAUSE YOU'RE SO COOL.

10:03.303 --> 10:06.774
YEAH, 'CAUSE
I'M DOWN WITH THAT.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.275
COME ON, GIMME A BREAK.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.646
TV (Girl): HE'S OUT THERE!

10:12.680 --> 10:15.649
HE'S WAITING FOR US!

10:15.683 --> 10:17.885
( screaming )

10:20.453 --> 10:23.190
( thud )

10:23.223 --> 10:25.258
( wind whistling )

10:25.292 --> 10:27.761
( telephone rings )

10:28.862 --> 10:30.397
( ringing )

10:30.430 --> 10:34.401
HE'S COMING TO KILL US!
 WE'RE GONNA DIE!

10:34.434 --> 10:36.704
( telephone rings )

10:36.737 --> 10:38.338
DON'T ANSWER IT!

10:43.176 --> 10:44.778
HELLO?

10:47.180 --> 10:48.749
HELLO?

10:59.259 --> 11:01.428
( telephone rings )

11:05.866 --> 11:07.100
HELLO?

11:08.736 --> 11:12.072
HELLO, IS ANYBODY THERE?

11:12.105 --> 11:14.041
Alison:
 WERE YOU AT
 THE COSTUME SHOP TODAY?

11:14.074 --> 11:15.876
ALISON?
 DID YOU SEND ME A TEXT?

11:15.909 --> 11:19.780
NO. WHY?
ALI, WHAT'S WRONG?

11:19.813 --> 11:22.015
FORGET IT.
( knock on door )

11:22.049 --> 11:23.416
I'VE GOTTA GO.

11:23.450 --> 11:26.253
( doorbell,
knocking )

11:39.199 --> 11:41.134
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.770
YOUR MOM DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG,

11:42.803 --> 11:44.337
SHE DID THE RIGHT THING.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.774
I HAD A FEW MARTINIS
AT THE GRILL.

11:46.807 --> 11:50.043
THEN SHE WISELY
ACCEPTED MY OFFER
TO DRIVE HER HOME.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.813
SO HERE'S YOUR KEYS.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.347
THANK YOU, OFFICER.
MM-HMM.

11:54.381 --> 11:58.051
I'M GLAD I COULD HELP.
AND IT'S DARREN, BY THE WAY.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.022
OKAY. I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.457
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.796
I'M SORRY, HANNA.

12:08.829 --> 12:12.399
SO WHAT? YOU HAD
TOO MUCH TO DRINK.
WHO CARES?

12:12.432 --> 12:14.534
NO, NOT THAT.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.404
ABOUT THE MESS WE'RE IN.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.073
I SHOULD HAVE
SEEN IT COMING.

12:20.107 --> 12:24.444
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU FEEL BAD
FOR WHAT DAD DID TO US.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.847
HE'S THE ONE WHO SHOULD BE
ROTTING IN HELL.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.918
OKAY, STOP.
HE'S STILL YOUR FATHER.

12:30.951 --> 12:34.121
HOW BAD IS THE MESS WE'RE IN?

12:34.154 --> 12:37.257
I WILL TAKE CARE OF IT,
HONEY.

12:45.398 --> 12:48.501
YOU REMEMBER WHAT
I TOLD YOU, RIGHT?

12:48.535 --> 12:51.038
SHE'S PRETTY UGLY.

12:51.071 --> 12:53.173
HOW UGLY
IS PRETTY UGLY?

12:53.206 --> 12:54.842
HIDEOUS.

12:54.875 --> 12:58.011
AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED
ON HER BIG ASS.

13:03.483 --> 13:06.186
Announcement:
 DON'T FORGET TO BUY YOUR
 HALLOWEEN FESTIVAL TICKETS.

13:06.219 --> 13:10.223
IF YOU HAVEN'T CAST YOUR VOTE
 FOR SOPHOMORE CLASS PRESIDENT,

13:10.257 --> 13:12.425
YOU HAVE UNTIL FIFTH PERIOD
 TO DO SO

13:12.459 --> 13:14.828
IN THE MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM.

13:14.862 --> 13:17.931
EM, YOU NEED TO GO
TALK TO BEN.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.200
WHAT'S GOING ON?
HE'S BEEN TELLING
ALL OF HIS GUY FRIENDS

13:20.233 --> 13:22.169
THAT YOU GUYS HAD SEX
LAST WEEKEND.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.404
Aria: WHAT?

13:24.437 --> 13:26.473
EM, I WILL GO OVER THERE
WITH YOU. LET'S SHUT
THIS THING DOWN RIGHT NOW.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.943
ARIA, DON'T.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.912
EMILY, YOU CAN'T
JUST IGNORE THIS.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.481
EM?

13:35.582 --> 13:36.950
OH, MY GOD.

13:36.984 --> 13:39.619
IS IT TRUE?

13:39.652 --> 13:42.289
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?
TELL US WHAT?

13:43.891 --> 13:45.258
HI, YOU GUYS.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.995
IF YOU IGNORE IT,
IT WILL GO AWAY.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.078
BEN'S TELLING PEOPLE
WE HAD SEX.

14:05.112 --> 14:07.280
WHAT?

14:07.314 --> 14:10.083
AND HE'S STILL BREATHING
BECAUSE?

14:10.117 --> 14:11.952
IT'S TRUE.

14:11.985 --> 14:15.255
I CAN'T BELIEVE EMILY
LOST HER VEE BEFORE
ANY ONE OF US DID.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.656
WHY IS THAT SO HARD TO BELIEVE?

14:16.689 --> 14:18.658
I DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING BY IT,

14:18.691 --> 14:21.128
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU WERE A PRUDE.

14:21.161 --> 14:24.564
SHY ON THE STREETS...
SEXY IN THE SHEETS.

14:24.597 --> 14:27.467
I KNEW THERE WAS
SOMETHING DIFFERENT
ABOUT YOU.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.579
Mona: ALISON!
DO YOU HEAR MONA?

14:39.612 --> 14:41.381
HEY, ARIA!
HEY, GUYS!

14:41.414 --> 14:42.916
IS SHE EVER GONNA
GET A CLUE?

14:42.950 --> 14:44.551
WHAT A DORK. SWITCH.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.561
ISN'T THAT YOUR DAD'S CAR?

15:22.089 --> 15:23.290
EVER HEARD OF KNOCKING?

15:23.323 --> 15:25.692
YOU WANT TO KEEP ME OUT,
PUT A LOCK ON IT.

15:25.725 --> 15:28.195
WHAT ARE YOU
AND YOUR STONER BUDDIES
DOING BEHIND YOUR LOCKED DOOR?

15:28.228 --> 15:30.430
YOU REALLY
WANT TO KNOW?

15:30.463 --> 15:34.167
GIMME TWENTY BUCKS.
I'M BUYIN' THE BEER
TONIGHT.

15:34.201 --> 15:38.305
TWENTY BUCKS FOR A SECRET?
YOU'RE SO CHEAP.

15:40.373 --> 15:43.410
WE'RE MAKING A MOVIE.
WHAT KIND OF MOVIE?

15:43.443 --> 15:46.546
IF I TOLD YOU THAT
I'D HAVE TO KILL YOU.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.715
THIS WAS ON THE PORCH.

15:53.686 --> 15:54.954
GOODBYE.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.128
( door closes )

16:17.377 --> 16:19.979
"IT'S MY TURN TO TORTURE YOU."

17:41.628 --> 17:44.431
DID YOU FIND
ANYTHING GOOD?

17:44.464 --> 17:48.601
WELL, I COULD BE A MAID
FOR THE HACKEN FAMILY,

17:48.635 --> 17:51.804
OR A NURSEMAID
FOR A DIRTY OLD MAN.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.308
THIS IS INTERESTING.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.211
( doorbell rings )

18:02.615 --> 18:05.285
MOM, IT'S THAT COP.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.189
WAIT IN THE KITCHEN.

18:17.197 --> 18:21.568
HEY. RAN INTO
THE MAILMAN OUT HERE.
OH. THANK YOU.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.871
I PATROL THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
SO I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY
AND SEE HOW YOU WERE DOING.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.140
I'M FINE.
GOOD.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.842
AND YOUR DAUGHTER,
SHE'S ALL RIGHT?
WE'RE BOTH FINE.

18:29.876 --> 18:33.146
I'M SURE IT'S NOT EASY
TO ADJUST TO LIVING WITHOUT
A MAN IN THE HOUSE.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.348
WE'RE ADJUSTING.
WELL, LISTEN,

18:35.382 --> 18:38.151
IF YOU EVER NEED ANYTHING,
I'M AVAILABLE.

18:38.185 --> 18:41.321
I THINK YOU MIGHT
HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD
THE SITUATION LAST NIGHT.

18:41.354 --> 18:44.191
I JUST NEEDED A RIDE HOME.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.459
THIS IS JUST ME,
TRYING TO BE NICE.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.928
THANK YOU.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.231
YOU SHOULD WATCH YOURSELF
ON THE ROADS OUT THERE.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.732
WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?

18:52.765 --> 18:56.936
PEOPLE ARE UNPREDICTABLE...
THAT'S ALL.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.905
HAVE A NICE DAY.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.946
WHAT WAS THAT?

19:06.979 --> 19:11.184
THAT WAS A HORNY COP.

19:11.218 --> 19:13.620
BUT I THINK HE GETS IT.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.523
I'M SURE WE WON'T SEE HIM AGAIN.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.899
( knocking on door )

19:31.238 --> 19:32.939
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
HANGING OUT WITH ARIA.

19:32.972 --> 19:36.709
SHE WASN'T FEELING THAT GREAT
AFTER WE STOPPED FOR YOGURT.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.278
OH.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.550
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.485
WHAT IS IT?

19:47.720 --> 19:50.657
I'VE GOT A FRIEND
ON THE ELECTION COMMITTEE.

19:50.690 --> 19:54.561
I THOUGHT FOR SURE
YOU WERE A SHOO-IN, BUT...

19:54.594 --> 19:57.297
DID I LOSE?

19:57.330 --> 19:58.998
THEY'RE STILL COUNTING...

19:59.031 --> 20:02.669
BUT IT'S GONNA COME DOWN TO
A HANDFUL OF VOTES.

20:02.702 --> 20:06.473
ALI, I WASN'T KIDDING
WHEN I SAID THAT MY PARENTS
HAVE ALREADY PLANNED THIS PARTY.

20:06.506 --> 20:09.576
THEY BOOKED A ROOM,
THEY'VE INVITED LIKE
HALF THE CLUB.

20:09.609 --> 20:13.313
I'M SURE MELISSA'S MADE
A FEW OF THOSE CALLS.

20:13.346 --> 20:18.451
WAKE UP, SPENCER.
THE BIG SISTER ACT
IS JUST THAT--AN ACT.

20:18.485 --> 20:21.488
AND SHE'S SUCH A MARTYR
WITH THE HASTINGS FAMILY CRAP.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.956
SHE WORKS SO HARD
TO BE PERFECT

20:23.990 --> 20:28.495
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT
YOUR PARENTS LOOKING BEYOND
THE GLOW OF HER HALO.

20:28.528 --> 20:31.398
SHE DOESN'T WANT THEM
TO SEE YOU.

20:31.431 --> 20:34.901
MELISSA'S JUST TRYING
TO SURVIVE IN THIS FAMILY,
JUST LIKE ME.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.903
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

20:36.936 --> 20:39.939
BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE
SHE'S WINNING, AND YOU'RE NOT.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.875
IF I LOSE TOMORROW, ALI...

20:42.909 --> 20:45.778
LOOK, IF YOU
REALLY WANT THIS...

20:47.314 --> 20:49.716
I CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.485
I DON'T WANT IT, ALI...

20:52.519 --> 20:54.654
I NEED IT.

21:08.568 --> 21:12.038
I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU
ALL AFTERNOON.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.940
WHERE'S MOM?

21:13.973 --> 21:17.344
SHE TOOK MIKE
TO THE MOVIES.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.980
ARE YOU OKAY?

21:21.013 --> 21:22.682
WHAT DOES SHE KNOW?

21:22.715 --> 21:24.451
NOTHING.

21:24.484 --> 21:27.387
HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO HER?

21:27.420 --> 21:29.856
LISTEN...

21:29.889 --> 21:33.326
WHAT YOU SAW WAS
THE END OF SOMETHING,
NOT THE BEGINNING.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.962
SHE'S TRANSFERRING
OUT OF MY CLASS.
I WON'T SEE HER AGAIN.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.697
AND THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO MAKE IT OKAY?

21:37.730 --> 21:40.032
NO...NO.

21:40.066 --> 21:42.435
BUT I'M HOPING
THAT IT'S ENOUGH

21:42.469 --> 21:45.705
FOR YOU TO REALIZE THAT
YOU DON'T NEED TO
TELL YOUR MOM ABOUT THIS.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.340
SERIOUSLY?

21:49.509 --> 21:50.710
THEN--

21:52.945 --> 21:54.814
YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO LIE FOR YOU?

21:54.847 --> 21:57.584
I MADE A MISTAKE.

21:57.617 --> 22:01.721
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
ANY BIGGER THAN IT IS
RIGHT NOW.

22:06.393 --> 22:08.094
WOULD YOU STILL THINK
IT WAS A MISTAKE

22:08.127 --> 22:11.964
IF I HADN'T SEEN YOU
WITH HER TODAY?
YES.

22:11.998 --> 22:15.935
ALL I'M THINKING ABOUT
RIGHT NOW IS YOUR MOM,
AND THIS FAMILY.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.804
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

22:19.439 --> 22:23.710
ARIA, YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO BE MAD AT ME.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.045
I'M JUST HOPING THAT THIS
CAN BE LESS ABOUT THAT

22:26.078 --> 22:28.715
AND MORE ABOUT
PROTECTING YOUR MOM.

22:28.748 --> 22:32.585
I DON'T THINK I CAN
EVER FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.562
I'M SO SORRY--

22:46.633 --> 22:50.136
WELL, I WILL RESPECT
WHATEVER YOUR DECISION IS.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.525
I KNOW A DOCTOR
IF YOU WANT TO GO ON THE PILL.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.861
HE'LL SEE YOU WITHOUT
TELLING YOUR MOM.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.096
I DON'T NEED TO
GO ON THE PILL.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.602
YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL,
EMILY.

23:22.635 --> 23:25.805
I MEAN, JUNO WAS A CUTE MOVIE,
BUT I WOULDN'T WANT TO LIVE IT.

23:25.838 --> 23:28.007
IT'S NOT THAT.

23:28.040 --> 23:32.612
I DON'T NEED TO GO ON THE PILL
BECAUSE I'M NOT HAVING SEX.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.180
IT WAS THAT BAD?

23:34.213 --> 23:35.848
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

23:35.882 --> 23:38.885
BEN AND I MADE OUT,
BUT I DIDN'T GIVE IT UP.

23:38.918 --> 23:43.122
THEN WHY IS HE TELLING PEOPLE
HE TOOK THE V.I.P. TOUR
TO NEVERLAND?

23:43.155 --> 23:45.024
I DON'T KNOW.

23:45.057 --> 23:47.093
WHAT AREN'T YOU
TELLING ME?

23:47.126 --> 23:49.662
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

23:49.696 --> 23:53.766
EVENTUALLY WE'LL DO IT,
SO PEOPLE CAN THINK IT NOW
OR THEY CAN THINK IT LATER.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.169
I CAN'T FIGURE YOU OUT.

23:59.606 --> 24:02.475
CAN WE JUST KEEP THIS
BETWEEN US?

24:02.509 --> 24:05.512
I DON'T WANT TO KEEP
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.

24:05.545 --> 24:06.946
SURE.

24:14.654 --> 24:17.590
WILL YOU STOP STRESSING?
I TOOK CARE OF IT.

24:18.791 --> 24:19.726
TOOK CARE OF WHAT?

24:22.895 --> 24:25.498
I HELPED HER WITH
HER ACCEPTANCE SPEECH.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.604
EASY ON THE COFFEE,
SPENCE.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.072
YOUR HAND'S
ALREADY SHAKING.

24:33.105 --> 24:37.610
ARE YOU KIDDING?
SPENCER BLEEDS CAFFEINE.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.111
YOU OKAY, SWEETIE?

24:39.145 --> 24:40.713
I'M FINE.

24:40.747 --> 24:42.248
WHAT'S WRONG, ARIA?

24:42.281 --> 24:43.750
HOW'S YOUR MOM?

24:43.783 --> 24:45.852
ALI.

24:49.956 --> 24:52.058
I-I'M SORRY.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.626
I'M SORRY, ALI.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.194
DON'T TOUCH ME.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.229
IT WAS JUST
AN ACCIDENT.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.766
IS THAT WHAT THE DOCTORS
TOLD YOUR MOM AND DAD
AT THE HOSPITAL?

24:59.799 --> 25:01.033
WHAT?

25:01.067 --> 25:03.536
I'VE HEARD THE STORIES
ABOUT YOU, HERMIE.

25:03.570 --> 25:05.972
MY NAME IS LUCAS.

25:06.005 --> 25:09.008
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE HERMIE TO ME.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.712
DO YOU STILL HAVE BOTH?

25:12.745 --> 25:15.114
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

25:15.147 --> 25:17.116
COME ON, GIRLS.

25:18.918 --> 25:21.821
BOTH WHAT, ALI?
 PARTS, HANNA.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.290
HE'S HALF-GUY, HALF-GIRL.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.862
ONE DAY SHE'LL GET
WHAT'S COMING TO HER.

25:33.666 --> 25:36.268
Announcement:
 STUDENTS, THE WAIT IS OVER.

25:36.302 --> 25:39.271
TO SAY IT WAS A TIGHT RACE
 IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

25:39.305 --> 25:42.842
WINNING BY TWO VOTES,
 PLEASE CONGRATULATE
 SPENCER HASTINGS,

25:42.875 --> 25:44.744
YOUR NEW CLASS PRESIDENT!

26:02.094 --> 26:03.863
( kids chattering )

26:21.113 --> 26:23.249
HEY.
HEY.

26:23.282 --> 26:26.018
HEY.
WHERE'S YOUR COSTUME?

26:26.052 --> 26:29.355
I'M JUST NOT REALLY FEELING
LIKE GOING TO A PARTY,

26:29.388 --> 26:31.891
BUT I WANTED TO SEE YOU GUYS
ALL DRESSED UP.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.861
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT, ARIA?

26:42.902 --> 26:45.137
OH, MY GOSH!
YOU GUYS!

26:45.171 --> 26:46.906
THERE'S SOMEBODY OUT THERE.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.607
HE'S WATCHING US.

26:49.742 --> 26:53.079
OH, MY GOD.
WHO IS THAT?

26:54.814 --> 26:56.649
I AM SO CREEPED OUT.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.918
WHOEVER IT WAS, THEY'RE GONE.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.426
THAT WAS FREAKY.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.662
IT'S HALLOWEEN, HANNA.

27:09.696 --> 27:11.798
DON'T YOU LOVE A GOOD SCARE?

27:11.831 --> 27:13.232
( doorbell rings )

27:13.265 --> 27:15.201
IT'S PROBABLY
THE PIZZA GUY.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.737
( doorbell )
HURRY UP BEFORE HE LEAVES.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.908
I DON'T WANT TO
GO DOWN ALONE.

27:21.941 --> 27:23.876
I'LL GO.
YEAH, ME TOO.
I'M HUNGRY.

27:25.812 --> 27:28.347
CAN I TALK TO YOU,
ARIA?

27:28.380 --> 27:29.782
YEAH.

27:31.851 --> 27:34.787
NOBODY LIKES A DOWNER,
ARIA...

27:34.821 --> 27:37.056
AND SINCE YOU SAW YOUR DAD
KISSING THAT TART,

27:37.089 --> 27:40.326
YOU'RE LIKE AN ENERGY SUCK
EVERY TIME YOU WALK
INTO A ROOM.

27:40.359 --> 27:42.829
( sighs )

27:42.862 --> 27:46.198
ALI, I'M KIND OF DEALING
WITH A LOT RIGHT NOW.
CAN YOU CUT ME SOME SLACK?

27:46.232 --> 27:49.435
ARE THEY GETTING A DIVORCE?
NO.

27:49.468 --> 27:52.204
IF I WERE YOUR MOM--
SHE DOESN'T KNOW.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.306
I KNEW YOUR DAD
WOULD TALK TO YOU OUT OF IT.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.710
I'M SO OVERTHINKING
ABOUT THIS.

27:57.744 --> 28:00.079
I JUST WANT TO GO TO A MOVIE

28:00.112 --> 28:03.382
AND BURY MY FACE
IN VAT OF POPCORN.

28:05.852 --> 28:08.187
YOU COMMITTED TO
THIS PARTY, ARIA.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.890
THERE'S GONNA BE
A GAZILLION PEOPLE THERE.
NOBODY'S GONNA MISS ME.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.892
I WILL.

28:12.925 --> 28:15.294
WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT,
BUT I JUST--

28:15.327 --> 28:18.798
YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T EASY
SCORING YOU AN INVITE.

28:18.831 --> 28:22.735
A WEEK AGO NOEL KAHN
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME.

28:22.769 --> 28:25.137
YEAH. YEAH, I GET IT, OKAY?

28:25.171 --> 28:28.007
I JUST... I'M SORRY.

28:30.009 --> 28:32.411
I DIDN'T TELL THE GIRLS
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

28:32.444 --> 28:35.047
I'M SURE
YOU APPRECIATE THAT.

28:36.816 --> 28:40.019
I DO...THANKS.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.789
ARE YOU SURE WE'RE
THE ONLY ONES WHO SAW THEM?

28:42.822 --> 28:46.392
I'D HATE FOR YOUR MOM
TO FIND OUT FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

28:46.425 --> 28:49.128
WOULD YOU ACTUALLY DO THAT?

28:49.161 --> 28:51.430
TRICK OR TREAT, ARIA.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.975
( band plays rock music )

29:03.009 --> 29:04.911
* OH YEAH YEAH

29:04.944 --> 29:08.314
* YEAH YEAH,

29:08.347 --> 29:09.916

29:12.218 --> 29:15.187

29:15.221 --> 29:19.291
Announcer:
THE BAND'S GONNA TAKE A BREAK,
THEY'LL BE BACK IN A FEW.

29:19.325 --> 29:23.029
IS THE DOCTOR IN?
ACTUALLY,
I'M A GYNECOLOGIST.

29:23.062 --> 29:26.065
OOH.
CARE TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT?

29:26.098 --> 29:29.401
HOT CHICK, BRITNEY,

29:29.435 --> 29:33.372
HOT WITCH, HOT INDIAN CHICK...

29:33.405 --> 29:37.009
AND, UH...
MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS.

29:37.043 --> 29:39.478
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHO THAT IS.
DOES ANYBODY?

29:39.511 --> 29:42.915
SHE BORN TO BE QUEEN,
BUT HER COUSIN STOLE
THE THRONE,

29:42.949 --> 29:44.516
AND THEN SHE WAS
ACCUSED OF TREASON

29:44.550 --> 29:46.853
AND HER FAMILY
HAD HER EXECUTED.

29:46.886 --> 29:49.588
( song plays
on sound system )

29:49.621 --> 29:52.925
IT'S MY SONG,
LET'S HIT THE DANCE FLOOR!

29:59.565 --> 30:03.936
Emily:
OH, MY GOD,
ANOTHER LADY GAGA?

30:03.970 --> 30:06.238
WHO IS THAT?

30:06.272 --> 30:07.539
JENNA.

30:15.514 --> 30:18.117
( song plays
on sound system )

30:24.090 --> 30:26.625
MEOW.
DO I KNOW YOU?

30:26.658 --> 30:28.861
NO, BUT YOU WILL.

30:31.630 --> 30:34.133
Jenna: YOU GUYS ARE SO NICE,

30:34.166 --> 30:37.136
I ALREADY FEEL LIKE
I BELONG HERE.
ROSEWOOD'S A FRIENDLY TOWN.

30:37.169 --> 30:40.272
I DECIDED TO WEAR
MY ORIGINAL COSTUME.
YOU LOOK GREAT.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.975
MAYBE EVEN BETTER THAN ME.

30:43.009 --> 30:44.076
SCRAM.

30:47.179 --> 30:50.549
WOW. YOU SAY "FROGGY,"
THEY JUMP.

30:50.582 --> 30:52.151
THEY'RE NOT AS DUMB
AS THEY LOOK.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.986
THEY KNOW
THEY NEED ME.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.521
CONGRATULATIONS.

30:55.554 --> 30:59.558
I CAN MAKE IT REALLY EASY
FOR YOU TO FIT IN HERE.

30:59.591 --> 31:02.561
IF I ACCEPT YOU,
EVERYBODY DOES.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.897
I KNOW HOW IT WORKS.

31:04.931 --> 31:08.034
WE'RE A TIGHT GROUP,
BUT I THINK THERE'S
ROOM FOR ONE MORE.

31:09.335 --> 31:12.471
I REALLY APPRECIATE
THE OFFER...

31:12.504 --> 31:15.874
BUT I LIKE TO
PICK MY OWN FRIENDS.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.617
YOU'RE DEFINITELY
THE BEST GAGA.

31:27.419 --> 31:30.256
BETTER NOT TELL ALISON THAT.
SHE DOESN'T SCARE ME.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.292
I'M JENNA.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.395
I'M MONA.

31:43.369 --> 31:45.104
HEY.

31:45.137 --> 31:47.706
I SAW YOU TALKING
WITH THAT NEW GIRL.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.341
WHAT WERE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

31:49.375 --> 31:52.044
NOTHING.
SHE'S A SLUT.

31:57.349 --> 31:59.085
HERE.

31:59.118 --> 32:02.388
YOU SHOULD GET RID
OF THE EVIDENCE.

32:06.458 --> 32:10.129
I THOUGHT YOU'D
LOOK AT THEM FIRST.

32:10.162 --> 32:14.300
YOU'D BE SURPRISED TO KNOW
WHO YOUR FRIENDS AREN'T.

32:23.042 --> 32:25.144
( band playing )

32:25.177 --> 32:28.614
* I'LL WATCH THIS
FOR A MINUTE *

32:28.647 --> 32:32.151
* IT COULD CHANGE
IN SECONDS... *

32:34.086 --> 32:36.322
WHY DO WE HAVE TO
GO TO THE WOODS
TO GET A DRINK?

32:36.355 --> 32:39.125
WHY CAN'T HE HAVE A KEG
LIKE A NORMAL PERSON?

32:39.158 --> 32:42.528
BECAUSE HE'S NOT
JUST A NORMAL PERSON.
HE'S NOEL KAHN.

32:47.133 --> 32:48.767
HUH.

32:48.800 --> 32:53.339
WELL...I GUESS WE MADE
A WRONG TURN SOMEWHERE.

32:55.507 --> 32:57.276
I'M NOT THAT THIRSTY
ANYMORE.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.978
( growls )
( girls scream )

33:03.249 --> 33:06.118
( both laughing )

33:06.152 --> 33:08.054
OKAY, LET'S JUST GO BACK.

33:08.087 --> 33:11.357
* ( lyrics indistinct )

33:42.621 --> 33:46.458
WERE YOU WISHING YOU COULD TASTE
HER CHERRY CHAPSTICK?

33:46.492 --> 33:48.360
WHAT?

33:48.394 --> 33:51.563
DON'T WORRY, EM.
YOUR SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.820
( rustling in bushes )

34:16.755 --> 34:19.725
HEY.
HAVE YOU SEEN ALI?

34:19.757 --> 34:21.760
NOT LATELY.

34:26.864 --> 34:28.434
OKAY...

34:28.467 --> 34:30.735
I USED TO THINK THAT
I WAS BORN IN THE WRONG CENTURY,

34:30.768 --> 34:33.205
BUT NOW THAT I'VE ACTUALLY
GONE TO THE BATHROOM
IN THIS THING...

34:33.239 --> 34:34.540
HAVE YOU SEEN ALI?

34:34.572 --> 34:38.143
LAST I SAW HER
SHE WAS AT THE BONFIRE.

34:38.177 --> 34:40.446
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE'D BAIL ON US, DO YOU?

34:40.478 --> 34:43.114
( cell phones ring )

34:43.149 --> 34:44.683
THAT'S WEIRD.

34:47.152 --> 34:49.521
OH, IT'S FROM ALI.

34:49.554 --> 34:52.690
"I'M IN TROUBLE.
COME ALONE."

35:02.201 --> 35:03.802
WHAT'S THE ADDRESS?

35:03.835 --> 35:06.438
IT'S 313 MOCKINGBIRD.

35:13.679 --> 35:16.582
I AM NOT GOING IN THERE.

35:16.615 --> 35:21.287
NO. THIS IS
SOME KIND OF JOKE.
SHE'S NOT IN THERE.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.622
WHAT IF IT'S NOT A JOKE?

35:54.253 --> 35:55.321
ALI?

35:57.889 --> 35:59.825
THIS ISN'T FUNNY
ANYMORE, ALI.

36:15.607 --> 36:16.808
ALISON!

36:20.479 --> 36:21.847
( distant clatter )

36:21.880 --> 36:23.715
( gasps )

36:23.749 --> 36:26.652
IT WAS JUST THE WIND.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.254
COME ON.

36:44.336 --> 36:46.872
( floorboards creak
in distance )

37:19.938 --> 37:21.307
ALI?

37:22.441 --> 37:24.476
( all gasp, scream )

37:37.656 --> 37:39.925
( rattling doorknob )

37:55.006 --> 37:56.642
YOU GUYS.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.978
( footsteps )

38:03.515 --> 38:04.816
IT'S LOCKED.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.652
ALI?

38:08.086 --> 38:10.789
DID YOU SEE HIM?
IS HE STILL HERE?

38:10.822 --> 38:13.024
WHO?
COME ON.

38:13.058 --> 38:14.426
COME ON.

38:18.630 --> 38:21.333
I DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS.
ALI, WHAT IS GOING ON?

38:21.367 --> 38:23.835
HE GRABBED ME AT THE PARTY.
I TRIED TO SCREAM,
BUT HE'S GOT A KNIFE.

38:23.869 --> 38:26.104
FOR REAL?
HE SAID HE BROUGHT ME HERE
TO KILL ME.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.907
I'M CALLING 911.
HE LOCKED ME IN A CLOSET,

38:28.940 --> 38:31.076
AND WHEN HE OPENED IT,
I JUST FREAKED ON HIM.

38:31.109 --> 38:33.712
I'VE BEEN HIDING UP HERE
EVER SINCE.
I'M NOT GETTING A SIGNAL.

38:36.382 --> 38:39.751
THERE'S NOBODY OUT THERE.
ALI, IT'S PROBABLY JUST
SOMEBODY TRYING TO SCARE YOU.

38:39.785 --> 38:42.087
IT'S THAT GUY THAT WAS
WATCHING US AT SPENCER'S.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.922
HE'S WEARING
THE SAME COSTUME.

38:43.955 --> 38:45.891
WE HAVE TO
GET OUT OF HERE NOW.

38:45.924 --> 38:48.360
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL
WE KNOW THAT FREAK'S GONE!

38:48.394 --> 38:49.895
LOOK, I CALLED YOU
FROM THE HALLWAY,

38:49.928 --> 38:51.663
I KNOW I'VE GOT
A SIGNAL THERE.

38:51.697 --> 38:53.399
LOCK THE DOOR BEHIND ME.

38:53.432 --> 38:54.700
ALI.
ARE YOU SURE?

38:54.733 --> 38:56.101
NO, ALI, DON'T.

38:56.134 --> 38:58.970
DON'T OPEN THIS DOOR
FOR ANYONE BUT ME.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.672
LOCK THE DOOR.

39:08.013 --> 39:11.483
( Ali screams )
HELP!
ALI!

39:11.517 --> 39:13.785
IT'S JAMMED!

39:13.819 --> 39:15.721
YOU GUYS, IT'S JAMMED!

39:15.754 --> 39:17.355
ALI!
ALI!

39:18.657 --> 39:19.891
NO! ( screams )

39:19.925 --> 39:22.928
( all shouting )

39:22.961 --> 39:24.896
ALI!

39:24.930 --> 39:27.466
ALISON!

39:29.668 --> 39:33.572
( all screaming,
shouting )

39:33.605 --> 39:34.906
ALI!

39:34.940 --> 39:37.876
OH, MY GOD.
ALI!

39:37.909 --> 39:39.978
ALI!

39:40.011 --> 39:41.413
ALI!

39:41.447 --> 39:43.549
( screaming )

39:46.785 --> 39:49.154
( wind whistling )

39:49.187 --> 39:51.823
EMILY, ARE YOU OKAY?
LET'S GO!

39:51.857 --> 39:54.192
YOU GUYS, PLEASE! MOVE!

39:54.225 --> 39:56.094
YOU GUYS, COME ON!

39:56.127 --> 39:57.763
COME ON!

40:00.699 --> 40:02.668
ALI?

40:02.701 --> 40:04.570
ALI?

40:04.603 --> 40:05.937
( creaking )

40:05.971 --> 40:07.138
ALISON.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.845
LOOK AT YOU FOUR.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.981
YOU'RE SCARED TO DEATH.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.819
I TOTALLY GOT YOU.

40:23.622 --> 40:24.923
IT WAS A HOAX.

40:24.956 --> 40:27.092
THE ZOMBIE WAS NOEL.

40:28.694 --> 40:30.128
HAPPY HALLOWEEN.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.509
KETCHUP.

40:43.542 --> 40:44.910
WANT SOME, HANNA?

40:47.579 --> 40:51.683
COME ON, YOU GUYS...
IT WAS FUNNY.

40:51.717 --> 40:54.586
WE'RE NOT LAUGHING.
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE.

40:54.620 --> 40:57.556
YOU GUYS PASSED THE TEST.
WHAT TEST?

40:57.589 --> 41:01.092
THE WAY YOU GUYS
CAME CHARGING IN HERE...

41:01.126 --> 41:03.862
I KNOW I CAN
COUNT ON YOU NOW.

41:03.895 --> 41:07.933
IF I REALLY NEED YOU,
YOU'LL BE THERE FOR ME.

41:10.268 --> 41:13.839
LET'S GO.
WE'RE MISSING A PARTY.

41:23.014 --> 41:25.050
*

41:25.083 --> 41:27.986
* PRETTY LITTLE NEIGHBOR

41:28.019 --> 41:32.257
* I LOVE YOU...

41:32.290 --> 41:35.093
I FEEL LIKE WE CAME BACK
TO A DIFFERENT PARTY.

41:35.126 --> 41:38.730
Aria: I KNOW,
EVERYONE'S SO MUCH OLDER.

41:38.764 --> 41:40.999
WHAT'S YOUR SISTER
DOING HERE?

41:41.032 --> 41:43.234
OH, THESE MUST BE
ERIC'S FRIENDS.

41:43.268 --> 41:45.971
HE'S NOEL'S
OLDER BROTHER.

41:55.947 --> 41:57.549
WHAT THAT SAYING?

41:57.583 --> 42:01.219
"BOYS PLAY WITH TOYS
AND GIRLS PLAY WITH BOYS."

42:01.252 --> 42:02.888
I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT ONE.

42:02.921 --> 42:03.955
HUH.

42:11.096 --> 42:12.798
WHO'S THAT GUY
DRESSED UP AS A COP?

42:12.831 --> 42:15.967
THAT'S NOT A COSTUME.
HE'S A REAL COP.

42:16.001 --> 42:17.669
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

42:17.703 --> 42:20.238
NO. UM, I'VE JUST...

42:20.271 --> 42:23.041
SEEN HIM DIRECTING TRAFFIC.

42:24.275 --> 42:26.645
BITCH.
WHO IS THAT?

42:29.815 --> 42:31.583
DON'T HATE ME, OKAY?

42:31.617 --> 42:33.251
ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT WAS PERFECT.

42:33.284 --> 42:34.786
YOU'RE NOT MAD?
NO!

42:34.820 --> 42:36.722
THE WAY YOU SHOVED ME
AGAINST THAT WALL?

42:36.755 --> 42:38.123
YOU EVEN SCARED ME.

42:38.156 --> 42:40.792
UH, I'M NOT SURE
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

42:40.826 --> 42:42.127
Aria: NOEL.

42:42.160 --> 42:44.896
WE KNOW THAT IT WAS YOU.
ALISON TOLD US.

42:44.930 --> 42:47.165
IF SOMEBODY
MESSED WITH YOU GUYS,
IT WASN'T ME.

42:47.198 --> 42:49.167
MY BROTHER TOOK THE CAR
FOR A BEER RUN.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.036
I'VE BEEN STUCK HERE
ALL NIGHT.

42:51.069 --> 42:54.105
IF YOU'RE LYING TO ME--
I'M NOT.

42:54.139 --> 42:57.042
IF IT WASN'T YOU...

42:57.075 --> 42:59.010
( cell phone beeps )

43:07.653 --> 43:09.154
WHO IS IT?

43:09.187 --> 43:11.322
IT'S A SECRET.
