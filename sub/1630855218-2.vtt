19:46.385 --> 19:48.554
but this is not
how you go about things.

19:48.554 --> 19:51.190
You should be going over
to child protective services

19:51.190 --> 19:53.125
over on Broad Street.
You go in there,

19:53.125 --> 19:55.427
tell 'em you'll do
better from now on.

19:57.162 --> 19:58.664
You might want
to get yourself calmed down

19:58.664 --> 20:00.265
before you go on over there.

20:02.301 --> 20:05.037
[door creaking and clanking]

20:05.037 --> 20:07.539
- [indistinct chatter]
- You still got a fever.

20:08.407 --> 20:10.642
Where is Mama?

20:10.642 --> 20:12.377
At home probably.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.680
You should eat
some food.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.315
Where is Mama?

20:16.315 --> 20:18.217
At home, Dora.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.952
- When is she coming?
- Come on, you gotta eat up now.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.654
She'll come
when she can, okay?

20:22.654 --> 20:26.325
Listen. Listen
to me, Niizh.

20:27.993 --> 20:30.195
Everything's gonna be okay.

20:30.996 --> 20:33.198
Now, you should eat
some food.

20:37.669 --> 20:39.838
[woman]: Sit up straight.

20:39.838 --> 20:41.907
Sit up straight.

20:44.042 --> 20:45.978
Don't play with that.

20:50.415 --> 20:52.985
[engine buzzing]

20:56.255 --> 20:58.090
[dog barking]

21:01.660 --> 21:04.196
Aaaaah!

21:09.668 --> 21:11.403
[car door closes]

21:25.083 --> 21:26.585
[coin clinking]

21:26.585 --> 21:30.355
[dial tone]
[buttons clicking]

21:32.758 --> 21:34.359
[three beeps]

21:34.359 --> 21:36.528
[female voice]: Your call c.

21:36.528 --> 21:39.564
Please check the number
and dial again.

22:00.619 --> 22:03.555
[coin clinking]
[dial tone]

22:03.555 --> 22:07.259
[buttons clicking]

22:07.259 --> 22:09.561
[phone ringing]

22:10.429 --> 22:11.897
man: [Mueller residence.]

22:11.897 --> 22:15.434
Hi. I'm looking
for a Dora Mueller.

22:15.434 --> 22:17.903
[I'm sorry, I think
you got the wrong number.]

22:17.903 --> 22:20.539
Okay, thank you.

22:20.539 --> 22:22.274
[coin clinking]

22:25.210 --> 22:27.779
[indistinct chatter]

22:27.779 --> 22:30.048
[phone ringing]

22:30.048 --> 22:32.217
My children
were taken yesterday,

22:32.217 --> 22:34.753
and I'm here
because I want them back.

22:34.753 --> 22:35.987
Well, okay.

22:35.987 --> 22:38.457
- Your name?
- Patricia Little Bird.

22:49.768 --> 22:51.436
[woman]: How can we help?

22:53.905 --> 22:55.540
Didn't know it would be you.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.542
Well, we're the child case
workers on your file,

22:57.542 --> 22:59.811
- so who else would it be?
- You took my kids yesterday.

22:59.811 --> 23:00.946
Apprehended.

23:00.946 --> 23:03.315
Your children
were apprehended.

23:04.649 --> 23:06.618
I want to see if I can
get them back.

23:06.618 --> 23:09.287
What you're saying is
you would like to be notified

23:09.287 --> 23:11.490
once the protection hearing
is set?

23:11.490 --> 23:14.860
- [Patti]: Yes.
- You coming in today so soon

23:14.860 --> 23:16.828
really shows how much you care.

23:18.363 --> 23:21.900
The post-apprehension hearing
will be in a few months.

23:23.635 --> 23:25.470
A few months?

23:25.470 --> 23:27.873
With court delays
even longer.

23:28.707 --> 23:31.276
I can't see them
for a few months?

23:31.276 --> 23:33.178
Are they being looked after?

23:33.178 --> 23:35.280
They are.

23:35.280 --> 23:38.016
Mrs. Little Bird...

23:38.016 --> 23:40.886
were you looking after them?

23:42.120 --> 23:44.623
Do you understand
that they were removed

23:44.623 --> 23:47.526
from your care
because we deemed you unfit?

23:49.428 --> 23:50.862
Once we apprehended
your children,

23:50.862 --> 23:52.597
you forfeit your right
to know anything

23:52.597 --> 23:55.767
about their circumstances
or their whereabouts.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.869
They are temporary wards
of the Crown.

23:59.738 --> 24:01.740
Do you follow?

24:01.740 --> 24:03.442
They are under the care

24:03.442 --> 24:06.178
and protection
of the government now.

24:09.581 --> 24:11.683
- If it was your children--
- I wouldn't neglect

24:11.683 --> 24:13.418
my children.

24:13.418 --> 24:15.187
Adele, would you... would you
neglect your children?

24:15.187 --> 24:16.354
[softly]:
I-I don't have...

24:16.354 --> 24:18.056
I... I don't...

24:18.056 --> 24:20.325
- No.
- I don't think.

24:20.325 --> 24:23.662
I didn't say it properly

24:23.662 --> 24:26.331
when you were in the house...

24:26.331 --> 24:28.934
but they are my children.

24:29.901 --> 24:32.070
I look after them.

24:32.070 --> 24:33.738
I feed them.

24:35.507 --> 24:37.442
I'm their mother.

24:42.080 --> 24:45.116
I came today to say

24:45.116 --> 24:48.420
I will do better. Please.

24:49.221 --> 24:50.989
Mrs. Little Bird,

24:50.989 --> 24:54.159
don't you have
a fourth child?

24:54.159 --> 24:57.996
A 12-year-old
named Leo?

25:00.298 --> 25:02.434
- Yes.
- Yes.

25:03.201 --> 25:05.270
If I were you,
I would be trying

25:05.270 --> 25:08.406
to hold onto the one child
that I have left.

25:11.009 --> 25:12.577
Mrs. Little Bird,
are you leaving?

25:12.577 --> 25:14.412
What are you doing?!

25:16.014 --> 25:17.115
Ha!

25:17.115 --> 25:20.252
Well, I guess
this meeting is over.

25:20.252 --> 25:23.255
Ha!
[phone ringing]

25:23.255 --> 25:25.390
- woman: [Hello?]
- Where's Leo?

25:25.390 --> 25:27.058
- [Patti?]
- Yeah.

25:27.058 --> 25:29.628
[He's outside. Leo!]

25:30.395 --> 25:32.864
You gotta take him
somewhere else,

25:32.864 --> 25:34.599
Asin's house.
Take him there.

25:34.599 --> 25:36.234
- [Okay.]
- I'm hanging up now.

25:36.234 --> 25:38.770
[Patti, don't hang up.
Are you there?]

25:38.770 --> 25:40.772
- [Hey?]
- Yeah, yeah.

25:40.772 --> 25:43.441
[Morris is
in the Indian hospital.]

25:43.441 --> 25:46.411
[I got a call from Shannon who
has a cousin who works there.]

25:46.411 --> 25:49.114
[Cops brought him in,
and he's...]

25:49.114 --> 25:52.183
[he's not doing
so good, Patti.]

25:52.183 --> 25:54.619
Okay. Okay.

25:55.921 --> 25:57.522
Take Leo now.

26:01.259 --> 26:03.895
[phone ringing]

26:03.895 --> 26:05.497
woman: [Hello?]

26:05.497 --> 26:08.533
Hi. I'm looking
for a Dora Mueller.

26:08.533 --> 26:10.101
[Dora?]

26:10.101 --> 26:11.436
Yeah.

26:11.436 --> 26:13.438
[She doesn't
live here anymore.]

26:13.438 --> 26:15.941
But this is where she lived?

26:15.941 --> 26:17.509
[Yes.]

26:18.276 --> 26:20.345
Do you know
where I can reach her?

26:21.346 --> 26:22.614
[No.]

26:22.614 --> 26:26.751
[I haven't seen her
in... five years now.]

26:26.751 --> 26:28.987
You don't have a phone number?

26:28.987 --> 26:31.389
- A forwarding address?
- [She ran off.]

26:36.194 --> 26:38.863
And you're... her mother?

26:38.863 --> 26:40.832
[I was, yes.]

26:42.100 --> 26:43.802
I'm her sister.

26:43.802 --> 26:45.770
I was adopted too.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.906
That's why I'm calling.

26:50.075 --> 26:52.544
Do you have any sense
of where I could find her?

26:55.880 --> 26:57.415
[No.]

26:59.050 --> 27:00.518
Well, I appreciate your time.

27:00.518 --> 27:03.421
You're the first person
I've talked to who knows her.

27:03.421 --> 27:06.725
Um, do you maybe have
a photograph of Dora?

27:07.859 --> 27:09.394
[Good luck finding her.]

27:09.394 --> 27:11.763
[dial tone]

27:14.833 --> 27:16.368
[coin clinking]

27:18.703 --> 27:21.206
[exhales]

27:28.680 --> 27:31.416
[woman]: You should
get yourself ready.

27:31.416 --> 27:34.619
The cops brought him in
late last night.

27:34.619 --> 27:36.421
They said he kept
slamming his head

27:36.421 --> 27:39.090
against the doors in holding.

27:39.090 --> 27:40.525
[nurse sighs]

27:41.126 --> 27:42.494
The doctor hasn't
been in this week yet,

27:42.494 --> 27:45.497
but... we got him
all cleaned up.

27:51.770 --> 27:54.973
Morris?
You have a visitor.

27:59.444 --> 28:01.179
[breathing audibly]

28:04.983 --> 28:06.551
I'm sorry.

28:06.551 --> 28:10.155
Shhh, shhh, shhh, shh...
It's okay.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.358
I'm so sorry.

28:15.560 --> 28:19.264
They... they fucked
me up and...

28:25.503 --> 28:28.807
- You gotta get the kids back.
- I will.

28:28.807 --> 28:31.042
Don't worry about that.

28:32.977 --> 28:35.780
You gotta do it now.

28:35.780 --> 28:37.615
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

28:38.550 --> 28:40.552
I'm gonna get them back.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.055
[soft music playing
on the radio]

29:36.508 --> 29:38.510
[door opens]

29:40.912 --> 29:42.046
Hi.

29:43.414 --> 29:44.582
Hi.

29:44.582 --> 29:46.417
I'm Esther.

29:46.417 --> 29:48.920
We spoke on the phone
about an hour ago.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.090
I'm Dora's sister.

29:53.158 --> 29:55.860
Uh, I... I...
[laughs nervously]

29:55.860 --> 29:58.930
I didn't know
she, um, had a sister.

29:59.998 --> 30:01.266
Are you her brother?

30:01.266 --> 30:04.068
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- I was thinking

30:04.068 --> 30:06.004
that if I came in person,

30:06.004 --> 30:08.239
you might want to talk to me
a little more,

30:08.239 --> 30:10.508
- maybe show me a photo of her.
- Yeah,

30:10.508 --> 30:12.510
well, I think there's a...
whole pile of them

30:12.510 --> 30:14.746
up in the attic actually.
Isn't there?

30:16.915 --> 30:18.349
I doubt it.

30:18.349 --> 30:20.718
Well, a photo would

30:20.718 --> 30:22.720
really mean a lot.

30:24.055 --> 30:27.592
Why don't you, um...
Why don't you leave a number.

30:27.592 --> 30:30.061
Yeah, sure.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.665
I'm staying
at a motel in town.

30:37.302 --> 30:39.304
[paper rustling]

30:41.973 --> 30:45.677
You said she ran away.
Why did she do that?

30:49.180 --> 30:51.783
She was
a good little girl.

30:51.783 --> 30:53.952
And then she turned bad and...

30:55.153 --> 30:57.088
- There was no turning her back--
- Mom, that's not...

30:57.088 --> 30:59.424
- it's not it went--
- Get inside. Go back inside.

31:05.830 --> 31:09.334
Well, what did the police say
when she went missing?

31:10.635 --> 31:13.338
What, you didn't report it
to the police?

31:14.205 --> 31:16.107
I did not, no.

31:16.107 --> 31:18.476
Weren't you
worried about her?

31:18.476 --> 31:21.446
Wait, are you
closing the door on me?

31:24.382 --> 31:26.885
Well, hey, I'd really like
that photo!

31:41.466 --> 31:44.135
[keys clinking]

31:46.838 --> 31:48.573
[knocking on car window]

31:52.510 --> 31:55.079
I'm gonna call you, okay?

31:55.079 --> 31:56.347
Okay.

31:58.616 --> 32:00.351
[car door closes]

32:03.488 --> 32:05.323
Oof...

32:07.292 --> 32:08.660
[engine revs up]

32:08.660 --> 32:10.628
- [detonation]
- Bezhig, come with me.

32:10.628 --> 32:12.730
[detonation]
Stand up. What's that?

32:12.730 --> 32:15.300
We'll sew the inside.
[detonation]

32:15.300 --> 32:16.734
It'll just take a minute.

32:16.734 --> 32:18.403
- A minute. Take it off.
- [man]: Smile.

32:18.403 --> 32:20.371
[woman]: I know you don't
want to come out. I'm gonna...

32:20.371 --> 32:22.707
Just for a second.
It's okay, okay?

32:22.707 --> 32:24.742
- I don't want to come out.
- I know you don't want to,

32:24.742 --> 32:27.545
- but it's gonna take one second.
- I don't want to come out.

32:27.545 --> 32:30.014
- Don't want to.
- Okay.

32:30.014 --> 32:32.650
My goodness me.
What's the matter with you?

32:32.650 --> 32:34.319
Come here.

32:34.319 --> 32:36.254
Now stop it, okay?

32:36.254 --> 32:38.489
All we want to do
is take your photo.

32:38.489 --> 32:41.826
We just want to make you
look your very, very best,

32:41.826 --> 32:44.128
so that people will see
your photo and say,

32:44.128 --> 32:47.598
"Oh my, what a handsome
little guy that is.

32:47.598 --> 32:50.001
"I'd like to take him home
with me and look

32:50.001 --> 32:53.404
after him
and make him happy." Okay?

32:53.404 --> 32:55.206
[camera clicks]

33:05.183 --> 33:06.818
[photographer]: There we go.

33:09.854 --> 33:12.890
Well, are you gonna quit?

33:14.292 --> 33:16.327
Girls who are gonna quit
all have that same look

33:16.327 --> 33:19.564
on their face: melodramatic.

33:24.235 --> 33:27.238
My brother,
he has a carwash,

33:27.238 --> 33:28.706
and he said that
I could work the till.

33:28.706 --> 33:30.942
Jesus, Adele.

33:30.942 --> 33:34.412
You're gonna let all
that education go to waste?

33:34.412 --> 33:36.581
I'm just finding it--

33:36.581 --> 33:38.383
What?

33:38.383 --> 33:39.951
Difficult.
[Jeannie sighs]

33:39.951 --> 33:41.919
[Adele]: All of the crying.

33:44.222 --> 33:46.491
[Jeannie]: You're not gonna be
able to do this job

33:46.491 --> 33:49.494
unless you can go beyond
being nice.

33:51.229 --> 33:53.231
You have to think to yourself,

33:53.231 --> 33:55.700
I'm saving these children...

33:55.700 --> 33:58.536
[camera clicks]
...from a life of poverty.

33:59.504 --> 34:00.605
Hmm?

34:03.941 --> 34:05.209
You know,

34:05.209 --> 34:07.111
the best thing to do
at the end of a long day

34:07.111 --> 34:08.780
is do what men do.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.716
Go home, kiss
that handsome husband of yours
