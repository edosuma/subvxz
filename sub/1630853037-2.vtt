(game chiming)

00:16.516 --> 00:18.309
(game over noise)
Ah...

00:18.351 --> 00:19.936
(game restarts)

00:19.978 --> 00:22.063
(game chiming)

00:28.903 --> 00:30.822
(whispers):
Get down.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.449
I don't know
about this.

00:32.490 --> 00:35.410
Dude, this isn't exactly
my idea of fun, either.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.454
But these dicks
illegally towed my baby

00:37.495 --> 00:39.539
from an overnight zone.
Fine.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.082
But if I'm gonna do this,
then you can at least tell me

00:41.124 --> 00:42.625
where you disappeared to
after your party.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.044
I didn't disappear.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.756
I went home
with someone, okay?

00:47.797 --> 00:49.632
Who? Stephen?
(sighs)

00:49.674 --> 00:52.177
No.
Don't tell me that you got
back together with Amy...

00:52.218 --> 00:55.055
Can we just focus on the felony
that we're about to commit?

00:55.096 --> 00:57.223
Please?
(phone buzzing)

01:01.394 --> 01:02.353
That your mysterious someone?

01:02.395 --> 01:04.355
Hey, Michaela. It's Mel.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.441
Uh, Vera.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.402
Again. I know it's late,

01:09.444 --> 01:11.905
but I just wanted to make sure
that you got my message.

01:11.946 --> 01:14.115
Messages.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.868
(buzzes)
(groans) I just...

01:16.910 --> 01:20.789
I'll explain everything later.
Okay? But first,

01:20.830 --> 01:24.084
we need to figure out a way
to distract that security guard.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.966
Seriously? Your slingshot
from when you were ten?

01:32.008 --> 01:34.344
Her name is Slingy,
thank you.

01:37.847 --> 01:40.141
(glass shatters)

01:40.183 --> 01:41.601
MEL:
I mean...

01:41.643 --> 01:44.395
what if we really are sisters?

01:44.437 --> 01:47.732
I mean, think about it.
I'm 28, you're 26.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.275
My mom could have
easily had another kid

01:49.317 --> 01:51.945
before I was old enough
to remember.

01:51.986 --> 01:55.448
I know, this is a lot
to take in, but...

01:55.490 --> 01:58.451
don't you want to know
the truth about...

01:58.493 --> 02:00.787
who you are?

02:07.836 --> 02:08.920
And you mocked Slingy.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.588
No. I mocked you,

02:10.630 --> 02:13.133
'cause you're a grown-ass woman
with a slingshot.
Shh.

02:13.174 --> 02:14.759
Now, if you're done
playing Stranger Things,

02:14.801 --> 02:17.220
can we just get
the hell out of here?
Okay.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.471
(grunts)

02:18.513 --> 02:20.598
(engine sputters)

02:22.433 --> 02:23.852
(engine sputters)

02:23.893 --> 02:24.936
GUARD:
Hey.
Ooh.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.939
Get out of the bus! Now!

02:27.981 --> 02:30.233
Oh, no, no, no. This
can't be happening...

02:30.275 --> 02:31.860
Dude, that was a gun.

02:31.901 --> 02:33.486
Like, a real gun.
Yeah.

02:33.528 --> 02:34.863
GUARD: I'm not
playing around.
Okay.

02:34.904 --> 02:36.489
(exhales)

02:36.531 --> 02:37.782
Think.

02:37.824 --> 02:38.992

02:39.033 --> 02:40.326

02:40.368 --> 02:42.954
Think, think, think...

02:42.996 --> 02:44.873

What the hell?

02:46.332 --> 02:47.709
(grunting)

02:47.750 --> 02:49.043
Get away!
The hell?

02:49.085 --> 02:50.712
Where did all those
butterflies come from?

02:50.753 --> 02:53.298
Oh, get off me. (grunts)

02:53.339 --> 02:57.093
What the hell's
going on?
I have no idea.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.306

hell out of here.

03:18.406 --> 03:20.783

03:20.825 --> 03:22.994
(chuckles)
Mm.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.871
(growls)
Patience, Seymour.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.831
We'll find her.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.000
And when we do...

03:29.042 --> 03:31.628
(snarling, growling)

03:32.587 --> 03:34.589
Exactly.

03:53.566 --> 03:54.984
(exhales)

03:55.026 --> 03:57.987
That demon has
a pretty good left hook.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.156
Had a pretty good
left hook.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.367
(wry chuckle) True.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.751
You doin' okay?

04:11.793 --> 04:15.255
I know this whole
Kaela thing's gotta be...

04:15.296 --> 04:17.048
pretty disappointing.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.133
I'm fine.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.427
She doesn't want to be
a part of this whole thing,

04:21.469 --> 04:24.222
and I can't exactly blame her.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.766
Especially after...

04:28.351 --> 04:30.478
Anyways...

04:30.520 --> 04:33.523
I am just gonna focus
on the things I can control.

04:33.564 --> 04:36.317
Like... the
demon population.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.361
And my thesis.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.613
Maggie...

04:42.949 --> 04:44.867
I'm just going to class.

04:44.909 --> 04:46.786
Deal's a deal.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.122
We slay all
the demons you want,

04:49.163 --> 04:51.040
but we always wear trackers,

04:51.082 --> 04:53.626
so we can find each other
if things go sideways.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.628
Fine. But just so we're clear,

04:55.670 --> 04:57.255
we're doing this so
I can save your ass

04:57.297 --> 04:58.589
when you get in trouble,
not the other way around.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.008

06:06.449 --> 06:08.743
She might be our sister.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.661
Yeah. According to your
insane conspiracy theory

06:10.703 --> 06:12.205
where Mom had another affair

06:12.246 --> 06:13.790
and didn't tell Ray about it

06:13.831 --> 06:15.625
and ditched her baby at

right now?

worked with her.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.963
We all saw it.

06:21.005 --> 06:23.132
It has to mean something.
I know.

06:23.174 --> 06:25.301
But if we come on so strong
that we scare her off for good,

06:25.343 --> 06:26.761
we're not gonna know
what that is.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.805
So please just
give her some space

(engine turns off)
(sniffing)

11:57.633 --> 11:59.677
(growls)

11:59.719 --> 12:02.096
I know you're hungry, Seymour.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.265
But he's not the one
we're after.

12:04.306 --> 12:06.267
(growls)
Here.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.061
A little something
to tide you over

12:09.103 --> 12:10.730
till we find her.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.982
(snarls, growls)

12:13.023 --> 12:15.234
(munching)

12:23.075 --> 12:24.368
(phone chimes)

12:39.216 --> 12:40.760
(whooshes)

12:40.801 --> 12:42.595
(witchboard chiming)
Oh, God.

12:43.512 --> 12:45.181
Kaela?

12:50.269 --> 12:52.313
(line ringing)

12:52.354 --> 12:53.939
Come on, Maggie, pick up.

12:53.981 --> 12:55.566
MAGGIE:
Hi. This is Maggie.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.110
I can't come to the phone
right now...
Screw it.

12:59.111 --> 13:02.573
(whooshing)

13:10.122 --> 13:12.041
KAELA:
Brynn, either pair
of shoes is fine.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.168
Come on, we're gonna be late.

13:15.836 --> 13:18.464
Mel? What are you
doing here?

13:19.423 --> 13:20.800
You're in danger.

13:20.841 --> 13:23.010
Yeah. From a crazy stalker lady

13:23.052 --> 13:24.720
who won't leave me alone.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.973
I'm serious. That big map
that you saw back in Seattle?

13:28.015 --> 13:29.975
It tells us whenever a witch
is in trouble,

13:30.017 --> 13:31.644
and your light just went off.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.771
Oh, how convenient.

13:33.813 --> 13:37.149
I don't return
any of your 12 voice mails,

13:37.191 --> 13:39.068
and suddenly I'm in danger.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.904
Michaela, I'm trying to help.
I don't need help.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.156
This life of yours with a threat
around every corner?

13:44.198 --> 13:45.616
I don't want it.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.953
Okay? I have a life
with incredible friends

13:48.994 --> 13:51.664
and a family
and my parents who raised me,

13:51.705 --> 13:53.541
who, by the way,
are the only people...
Crap.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.376
...who are allowed
to call me Michaela.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.753
MAGGIE:
Mel.
(groans)

13:57.795 --> 13:59.547
I'm so sorry, Kaela.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.340
Boundaries are not
her strong suit.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.424
Clearly.

14:02.466 --> 14:03.843
Please, just be careful.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.761
Okay.
And just have
a great night.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.806
(whispers):
What the...?

14:10.724 --> 14:12.476
Who were you talking to?
Oh.

14:12.518 --> 14:17.356
I was just giving directions
to someone who is very lost.

14:17.398 --> 14:20.234
You ready?
Yeah.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.735
Okay.

14:21.777 --> 14:23.779
Before you give me a lecture,
there was

14:23.821 --> 14:25.322
a red light on the witchboard.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.491
Yeah, I know. I saw it
after I got your call.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.369
Last I checked,
it's possible to protect someone

14:30.411 --> 14:32.329
without going full stalker.
Hey.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.623
I would want to know if there's
something evil coming after me.

14:34.665 --> 14:35.791
Yeah, but is there?

14:35.833 --> 14:37.376
What are you saying?

14:37.418 --> 14:38.544
The witchboard already tried
to play matchmaker

14:38.586 --> 14:40.045
with us and Kaela once before.

14:40.087 --> 14:42.089
Maybe it's doing it
again, trying to...

14:42.131 --> 14:43.799
trick us into coming here.

14:43.841 --> 14:46.343
And you're gonna bet
Kaela's life on a maybe?

14:46.385 --> 14:47.803
Look,

14:47.845 --> 14:49.346
you can go if you want,

14:49.388 --> 14:51.223
but I am not letting Michaela--

14:51.265 --> 14:55.352
Kaela-- out of my sight
until I know she's safe.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.313
Fine. I'll case the area.

14:57.354 --> 15:00.316
But while I'm gone,
just please promise me

15:00.357 --> 15:02.067
you'll...
Keep my distance. Yeah.

15:02.109 --> 15:04.028
Got it.

15:06.113 --> 15:08.574
What is that?
Binocu-lotion.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.743
She won't even know
I'm watching.

15:11.785 --> 15:15.039
Yeah,
I realize how that sounded.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.420
You sure you're okay with us
looking through Annie's stuff?

15:22.546 --> 15:25.549
I want to stop whoever
did this to her,

15:25.591 --> 15:27.760
before they hurt
anyone else.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.435
How do you do it?

15:36.477 --> 15:37.978
Do what?

15:38.020 --> 15:41.690
Keep going...

15:41.732 --> 15:43.609
when a part of you is gone.

15:50.407 --> 15:53.702
I'll let you know when
I figure it out.

15:59.083 --> 16:02.461
Harry, look.

16:02.503 --> 16:05.047
Maggie told me about this place.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.590
The Blue Camellia.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.760
The magical bar that
Mel's been frequenting.

16:11.595 --> 16:13.138
From what I hear,

16:13.180 --> 16:15.724
it's a bit rough around
the edges for a pixie.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.434
She would never go
to a place like that.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.729
Unless she was looking
for something.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.733
Like a special coin.

16:27.319 --> 16:30.906
(music playing indistinctly)

16:40.249 --> 16:44.461
Propinqua quod longe.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.592
Much better.

16:50.634 --> 16:54.471
Boxed wine, bean dip...

16:54.513 --> 16:56.015
foosball?

16:56.056 --> 16:57.933
How is that better than
being a Charmed One?

17:14.658 --> 17:16.201
MAGGIE:
Mel, pick up your phone.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.703
I've been looking for danger
for the past hour,

17:17.745 --> 17:19.955
and I still haven't
found a...

17:19.997 --> 17:21.540
thing.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.418
(sniffing)

17:25.419 --> 17:27.504
MAGGIE:
Can I help you?

17:31.842 --> 17:33.677
You don't happen to know
the owner

17:33.719 --> 17:36.013
of this motor coach, do you?

17:38.057 --> 17:39.433
Who are you?

17:39.475 --> 17:42.853
Just a concerned citizen.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.523
Have we met before?

17:46.565 --> 17:48.650
I think I'd remember.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.196
Now, what are you?

17:52.237 --> 17:54.281
That depends on you,
I suppose.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.408
Help me find the witch
who owns this bus,

17:56.450 --> 17:58.702
and I will be nothing more
than a brief

17:58.744 --> 18:00.662
and fleeting memory.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.956
Or?

18:02.998 --> 18:08.003
I can be something
much, much worse.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.967
(gasps)

18:14.009 --> 18:16.345
(panting)

18:31.360 --> 18:32.778
(laughs)

18:32.820 --> 18:34.905
(indistinct chatter)
(music playing)

18:36.740 --> 18:39.493
Hard to believe this is where
Mel's been spending her time.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.497
Beats getting your
ass kicked every night.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.415
I can tell you that much.

18:45.457 --> 18:48.127
Trouble in demon-hunting
paradise?

18:48.168 --> 18:49.878
(scoffs)

18:49.920 --> 18:52.047
I don't know, man.

18:52.089 --> 18:56.135
Maggie's just so far away
lately.

18:56.176 --> 19:00.514
No matter what I do,
I can't seem to reach her.

19:00.556 --> 19:03.725
Well, she's still grieving.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.561
Try to meet her
where she is.

19:05.602 --> 19:08.564
What if she just
keeps drifting

19:08.605 --> 19:11.024
further and further away?

19:11.066 --> 19:13.694
Trust me on this, I wasted
too many moments with Macy

19:13.735 --> 19:15.404
worrying about the future

19:15.445 --> 19:18.157
instead of cherishing the time
we actually had together.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.162
What?

19:23.203 --> 19:24.830
That's the first time
I've heard you say her name

19:24.872 --> 19:26.290
since she died.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.546
What are you boys drinking?

19:32.588 --> 19:34.673
Double whisk...
Nothing for us.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.633
But, uh,

19:36.675 --> 19:40.053
we were hoping maybe you could
help us with something else.

19:40.095 --> 19:44.016
Ever seen anyone around here
with a coin like this?

19:45.517 --> 19:48.312
I serve drinks,
not information.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.063
No, wait.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.691
We work with Mel
and Maggie Vera.

19:52.733 --> 19:53.942
The Charmed Ones.

19:53.984 --> 19:58.906
Kiss-n-tell Mel. Mm.

19:58.947 --> 20:02.868
Tell her she left
her tab open.

20:03.785 --> 20:06.288
Hey.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.414
Hey!

20:10.709 --> 20:12.794
A friend of ours was murdered

20:12.836 --> 20:14.755
by whoever's giving out
these coins.

20:14.796 --> 20:17.341
Now, I don't know
about you,

20:17.382 --> 20:18.926
but I've seen enough senseless
death and bloodshed

20:18.967 --> 20:20.719
to last two lifetimes.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.972
So do me a favor

20:24.014 --> 20:26.683
and tell me where the hell
you've seen them,

20:26.725 --> 20:28.310
because I know you have.

20:30.270 --> 20:34.149
(phone ringing)

20:38.487 --> 20:41.448
Yeah? Mm-hmm.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.534
You're the boss.

20:49.957 --> 20:53.835
There's a regular here.
A leprechaun. Deals in coins.

20:53.877 --> 20:56.755
He might be your guy.
Or he might not.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.340
Thanks.

20:58.382 --> 21:01.385
Oh, don't thank me.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.136
Thank Roxie.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.601
Come on, I am not
the worst dancer here.

21:09.643 --> 21:12.354
Mm.
I have moves.

21:12.396 --> 21:15.315
You've got a move:
the Brynn.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.776
(both laugh)

21:19.611 --> 21:21.989
I mean, hey, he's not wrong.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.449
You get two drinks in the girl
and she's all, like...

21:24.491 --> 21:26.952
Here it comes.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.829
(laughter)

21:30.747 --> 21:32.624
Do it with me.

21:32.666 --> 21:34.960
("Bailando" by Deluxxe playing)

21:35.002 --> 21:36.461
Com e on,
Carlos.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.010
There we go.

21:49.016 --> 21:52.227
MAGGIE: Mel, Mel,
you were right.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.645
She's being hunted by
some crazy old lady

21:53.687 --> 21:55.063
with a monster in her purse.

21:55.105 --> 21:57.190
Old-timey fashion?

21:57.232 --> 21:59.234
Schoolmarm vibe?

21:59.276 --> 22:01.153
Deadly pet tentacle?

22:01.194 --> 22:03.155
Yeah. How did you...

22:03.196 --> 22:04.489
It's called a Vittra.
I read about them

22:04.531 --> 22:06.450
in the old Book of Shadows.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.076
They were an ancient order

22:08.118 --> 22:09.411
who protected
the secret of magic

22:09.453 --> 22:13.040
by killing anyone
who showed it to humans.

22:13.081 --> 22:14.708
I didn't think
there were any left.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.711
Well, there's at least one,
and she is pissed.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.129
That is not good.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.422
You think?

22:20.464 --> 22:23.050
Uh, where's Kaela now?

22:23.091 --> 22:24.926
She's right over...

22:24.968 --> 22:27.637
No, wait. Sh...

22:27.679 --> 22:29.181
She was just here.

22:29.222 --> 22:31.183
Oh, crap.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.520
Guys, go. Go.

22:35.562 --> 22:37.564
Go, go.
Bad butterflies. Go.

22:37.606 --> 22:40.108
BRYNN:
Kaela.

22:42.110 --> 22:44.154
Hi.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.864
What the hell is going on?

22:52.287 --> 22:54.373
♪ ♪

22:58.960 --> 23:00.379
MAGGIE:
You had one job.

23:00.420 --> 23:01.671
One!
First you rip me

23:01.713 --> 23:03.298
for calling her too much,

23:03.340 --> 23:04.674
and now you're
freaking out because

23:04.716 --> 23:06.593
I lost sight of her
for one second.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.178
What is going on with you?

23:08.220 --> 23:10.097
I am terrified, okay?
Of what?

23:10.138 --> 23:13.683
The Vittra?
This. All of this.

23:13.725 --> 23:16.019
That bringing in
someone else

23:16.061 --> 23:20.524
into this... this life,
this sisterhood,

23:20.565 --> 23:21.858
means the same thing
that happened to Macy

23:21.900 --> 23:23.485
is gonna happen
all over again.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.612
Maggie...
We couldn't stop

23:25.654 --> 23:28.115
the destruction of
the sisterhood before.

23:28.156 --> 23:30.283
Why should this time
be any different?

23:34.037 --> 23:36.456
Maggie, look.

23:37.958 --> 23:40.502
Murder-y Poppins is
in the building.

23:48.844 --> 23:51.179
What was in those edibles?

23:51.221 --> 23:52.973
Brynn.

23:54.516 --> 23:57.102
(sighs heavily)

23:57.144 --> 24:00.397
I tried to tell you.
It's real.

24:00.439 --> 24:04.025
(chuckles) I'm a witch.

24:04.067 --> 24:07.446
So you're not sick?

24:07.487 --> 24:08.905
(chuckles)

24:08.947 --> 24:11.741
Seriously?
That's your first question?

24:11.783 --> 24:13.869
You're my best friend.
I frikkin' love you.

24:13.910 --> 24:16.746
Yes, that is my first question.

24:19.166 --> 24:22.294
Although I do have, like,
400 other questions.

24:22.335 --> 24:24.212
Yeah, you and me both.

24:24.254 --> 24:26.465
Do you think that this could
have something to do

24:26.506 --> 24:27.716
with your birth parents?

24:27.757 --> 24:29.092
Uh...

24:29.134 --> 24:32.429
(fire alarm sounding)

24:32.471 --> 24:34.598
Is that a fire alarm?

24:34.639 --> 24:38.268
(indistinct chatter)

24:38.310 --> 24:40.520
Heard a rumor there's
a leprechaun around here

24:40.562 --> 24:43.190
who might know a thing
or two about coins.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.361
Who's asking?

24:50.030 --> 24:52.949
What, you were expecting
a wee fella?

24:52.991 --> 24:55.327
Roxie sent us.

25:00.832 --> 25:03.585
I'm gonna cut to the chase,
Frank.

25:03.627 --> 25:06.755
This coin killed
a friend of mine.

25:06.796 --> 25:08.757
A pixie.
And I have it on good authority

25:08.798 --> 25:11.218
you had a hand in it.

25:11.259 --> 25:13.553
I'm a lot of things, boyo,

25:13.595 --> 25:17.140
but I'm no pixie killer,
just a middleman.

25:17.182 --> 25:19.184
Mm. For who?

25:21.394 --> 25:24.439
All I'll say is
some fella came 'round

25:24.481 --> 25:26.483
Looking to score
some cursed gold.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.859
Was offering a boatload for it

25:27.901 --> 25:30.278
So I didn't ask
any questions.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.031
Did he call himself
the Tallyman?

25:34.407 --> 25:36.409
Didn't get a name.

25:36.451 --> 25:39.538
Where can we find this fella?

25:39.579 --> 25:41.706
I don't sell out
me customers, lads.

25:41.748 --> 25:43.625
Bad for business.

25:45.585 --> 25:47.671
Thanks for the whiskey,
but we're done here.

25:47.712 --> 25:50.507
I wouldn't leave
if I were you, Frank.

25:52.425 --> 25:53.885
Oh, yeah?

25:53.927 --> 25:55.470
And why's that?

25:55.512 --> 25:59.599
Because I poisoned that bottle.

26:02.227 --> 26:04.229
Bollocks.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.398
You both drank
from it, too.

26:06.439 --> 26:09.734
HARRY:
My God. Yeah, he's right.

26:09.776 --> 26:12.529
Oh, if only there
were someone around

26:12.571 --> 26:15.907
who could heal the poison
out of our systems, hmm?

26:27.294 --> 26:28.837
Jordan?

26:39.598 --> 26:42.726
Now, unless you want to die

26:42.767 --> 26:45.895
an excruciating death,

26:45.937 --> 26:47.772
start talking.

26:50.108 --> 26:51.568
I don't know how to find him.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.195
It was a dead drop, I swear.
Where?

26:54.237 --> 26:58.241
At an old cabin in
the woods, outside Newport.

27:02.245 --> 27:04.331
Here.

27:04.372 --> 27:06.082
Now get the damn poison
out of me!

27:07.042 --> 27:09.044
What poison?

27:11.004 --> 27:13.965
See you around, Frank.

27:14.007 --> 27:16.009
What?

27:16.051 --> 27:18.637
(panting)

27:18.678 --> 27:21.139
(fire alarm sounding)

27:21.181 --> 27:24.309
(clicking tongue)

27:26.686 --> 27:29.272
You've been
a very naughty witch.

27:29.314 --> 27:33.026
Using your magic in front
of humans. (clicking tongue)

27:33.068 --> 27:35.278
Who the hell are you?

27:37.656 --> 27:39.449
Your punishment.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.284
(cries out)

27:44.788 --> 27:46.790
Back the hell off.
She's with us.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.708
I'm afraid I can't do that.

27:50.710 --> 27:52.796
Rules are rules.

27:54.464 --> 27:57.008
No exceptions.

28:07.602 --> 28:09.229
(cries out)

28:11.773 --> 28:14.025
Huh?

28:31.418 --> 28:33.837
You injured a human
with your magic.

28:33.878 --> 28:35.380
What happened to
"no exceptions"?

28:35.422 --> 28:37.090
That one wasn't supposed
to be here.

28:37.132 --> 28:40.260
That's why I pulled the alarm.
She's the guilty one.

28:40.301 --> 28:42.887
(growling)

28:42.929 --> 28:46.015
No, Seymour, please.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.600
It was a mistake, Seymour.

28:47.642 --> 28:50.645
Oh! No!

29:00.572 --> 29:01.906
She needs a doctor.

29:01.948 --> 29:04.951
No, she needs a healer.
And fast.

29:06.536 --> 29:09.414
That leprechaun better not have
given us a fake address.

29:13.918 --> 29:16.838
(door creaking)

29:33.521 --> 29:35.356
HARRY:
Oh, this is definitely
the place.

29:35.398 --> 29:37.859
Just a character from
a nursery rhyme, huh?

29:39.736 --> 29:41.154
(loud click)

29:41.196 --> 29:43.907
What was that?

29:43.948 --> 29:46.284
Stop.

29:46.326 --> 29:47.744
Damn it.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.163
Don't move.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.665
Pressure switches
rigged to explosives.

29:52.707 --> 29:56.544
I've seen them before
in Afghanistan.

29:56.586 --> 29:58.797
If one of us takes
the pressure off...

30:01.132 --> 30:02.592
Boom?

30:04.886 --> 30:06.221
Boom.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.232
Still no reception,
naturally.

30:17.273 --> 30:19.901
Of course, my bootleg
Whitelighter powers

30:19.943 --> 30:21.444
don't include orbing.

30:21.486 --> 30:25.490
If I could just reach you...

30:25.532 --> 30:27.116
No.

30:27.158 --> 30:29.327
I could orb us both
out of here.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.663
Or you could just
orb yourself out.

30:31.704 --> 30:34.666
Well, that'd set off
the explosives.

30:34.707 --> 30:37.252
Jordan, I know
I've been an ass lately,

30:37.293 --> 30:39.254
but I'm not going anywhere.

30:41.381 --> 30:46.302
Man, if I survived 26 years
of a witch's curse

30:46.344 --> 30:49.222
just to die like this,
I'm gonna be so pissed.

30:55.603 --> 30:57.772
If I don't die,
I'm gonna relish

30:57.814 --> 30:59.858
every second I get with Maggie.

31:01.192 --> 31:03.361
Try to meet her
where she is.

31:03.403 --> 31:05.196
And I'm gonna do the same
with you.

31:05.238 --> 31:06.990
Me?

31:07.031 --> 31:10.243
Maggie's not the only one
still grieving, bud.

31:13.079 --> 31:15.540
(door creaking)

31:22.964 --> 31:24.924
Maggie.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.384
How did you...

31:26.426 --> 31:28.261
I told you I'd use this thing
to save your ass.

31:28.303 --> 31:30.346
We need you guys back
at the command center now.

31:30.388 --> 31:32.557
My best friend is dying, and
we don't have a lot of time...

31:32.599 --> 31:34.517
Stop!
No, wait!

31:34.559 --> 31:37.061
This place is wired to blow.
Don't move.

31:39.856 --> 31:41.858
Okay, um...

31:41.900 --> 31:43.359
Well, if there is
an "on" switch,

31:43.401 --> 31:45.486
there's generally
an "off," so...

31:49.490 --> 31:53.286
There. That's the disconnect.

31:53.328 --> 31:56.873
Um, the question is,
how do we reach it?

31:56.915 --> 31:59.667
Macy's telekinesis power would
be super handy right now.

31:59.709 --> 32:02.587
So would Kaela's power
of manifestation.

32:05.548 --> 32:09.218
BRYNN:
You're like her, aren't you?

32:09.260 --> 32:11.471
A witch.

32:17.268 --> 32:19.395
Take care of her for me.

32:20.813 --> 32:23.942
She may act tough,
but she needs people.

32:25.485 --> 32:27.654
That is what
keeps her going.

32:27.695 --> 32:29.739
(breathing weakly)

32:29.781 --> 32:31.908
Brynn?

32:31.950 --> 32:33.868
Brynn!

32:33.910 --> 32:35.620
I can't do it. Hmm-mm.
Yes, you can.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.205
Do you have something
to draw with?

32:37.246 --> 32:39.123
Always, but...
Here.

32:39.165 --> 32:40.875
You're gonna draw on my jacket.
No, Maggie, you don't get it.

32:40.917 --> 32:43.252
When I want to manifest
stuff, nothing happens.

32:43.294 --> 32:45.922
But when I don't, poof!
All of a sudden

32:45.964 --> 32:48.591
there's an apple, and your
cousin is a paper doll.

32:48.633 --> 32:51.928
HARRY:
Kaela, you need to breathe.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.429
Just do it.

32:53.471 --> 32:55.431
Listen to him.
This is what he does.

32:55.473 --> 32:58.226
Close your eyes.
Close them.

33:00.853 --> 33:03.481
Visualize something that
can reach the switch.

33:03.523 --> 33:07.735
Something familiar.

33:07.777 --> 33:09.654
Personal.

33:09.696 --> 33:10.947
Something you know so well

33:10.989 --> 33:13.241
you could sketch it
in your sleep.

33:13.282 --> 33:14.534
Got it?

33:14.575 --> 33:17.161
Mm, mm-hmm.

33:17.203 --> 33:18.746
Draw.

33:20.915 --> 33:23.251
Draw it.

33:37.181 --> 33:38.141
Okay.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.435
HARRY:
Good.

33:40.476 --> 33:44.188
Now, open your
heart to magic.

33:44.230 --> 33:47.400
It's a part of
who you are.

33:47.442 --> 33:49.736
Your friend needs you.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.489
We need you.

33:54.490 --> 33:56.743
Because you...

33:59.704 --> 34:02.540
You are a Charmed One.

34:03.916 --> 34:05.960
(exhales)

34:18.181 --> 34:20.141
(laughing)

34:20.183 --> 34:22.685
Huh! You did it.

34:22.727 --> 34:24.228
Yeah.

34:24.270 --> 34:25.897
Duck, dude.

34:32.445 --> 34:35.156
Hurry, she's fading.

34:46.459 --> 34:47.960
(grunts)

34:48.002 --> 34:49.629
It's not enough.

35:00.640 --> 35:03.142
Come on. Come on.

35:04.185 --> 35:05.812
Come on, B.

35:07.855 --> 35:10.316
Come on. You're too stubborn
to go out like this.

35:12.568 --> 35:14.487
(gasps)

35:18.491 --> 35:20.868
Took you long enough.

35:20.910 --> 35:23.329
(laughs)

35:26.124 --> 35:28.584
Thank you.

35:28.626 --> 35:30.211
All of you.

35:40.596 --> 35:43.474
Well, this sure has been
a night to remember.

35:43.516 --> 35:46.185
Hey, about that,
we were kind of hoping

35:46.227 --> 35:48.563
you could, like, forget it.
(chuckles)

35:48.604 --> 35:51.232
Forget what?

35:51.274 --> 35:53.860
You ready to go?

35:59.657 --> 36:03.244
You're not coming, are you?

36:03.286 --> 36:05.913
Look, this is something
I gotta do.

36:05.955 --> 36:08.791
Not because I want to,
but because I need to,

36:08.833 --> 36:10.376
for both our sakes.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.883
Well, I expect daily texts,

36:16.924 --> 36:21.387
okay, weekly FaceTimes
and regular visits.

36:21.429 --> 36:25.141
Seeing as I'm just, um,
a big, freaky,

36:25.183 --> 36:28.728
glowy circle away.

36:28.769 --> 36:30.563
Bye.
Bye.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.073
(sighs)

36:41.115 --> 36:42.491
Are you okay?

36:42.533 --> 36:45.912
Yeah. Hmm.

36:45.953 --> 36:49.665
Thank you for saving her.
And me.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.878
It's what we do.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.714
And I'm sorry for
pushing you so hard

36:56.756 --> 36:59.133
to join our screwed-up
little family.

36:59.175 --> 37:00.551
I didn't even consider that

37:00.593 --> 37:02.178
you might already have one
of your own.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.764
It's okay. I get it.

37:06.390 --> 37:07.934
If joining this fight
is what I have to do

37:07.975 --> 37:11.437
to keep the people I love safe,
then I'm in.

37:11.479 --> 37:13.314
You sure?

37:13.356 --> 37:15.316
We don't want
to force you into anything.

37:15.358 --> 37:18.236
Fate brought us together
for a reason.

37:18.277 --> 37:22.240
And I'm not gonna lie, I...

37:22.281 --> 37:24.158

a lot more seriously.

37:44.387 --> 37:46.389
Agreed.

37:48.724 --> 37:51.852
Sure you don't want to stay in
with Kaela and Mel tonight,

37:51.894 --> 37:53.521

37:53.562 --> 37:55.815
