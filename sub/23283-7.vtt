Finally sharing a piece

07:05.166 --> 07:08.542
of our wedding cake.

07:08.583 --> 07:10.834
- I'm sorry, Tom,

07:08.583 --> 07:10.834
but I'm off cake.

07:10.875 --> 07:13.375
Ever since your mother sent us

07:10.875 --> 07:13.375
that awful anniversary cake...

[gagging]

07:13.417 --> 07:16.291
I can't eat cake.

07:16.333 --> 07:18.041
- It's our wedding cake.

07:18.083 --> 07:20.750
It was made with love

07:18.083 --> 07:20.750
and chocolate ganache.

07:20.792 --> 07:22.542
- I don't know,

07:20.792 --> 07:22.542
it's been in there 15 years.

07:22.583 --> 07:24.333
I mean, are you sure

07:22.583 --> 07:24.333
it's still good?

07:24.375 --> 07:25.750
- Ah, of course, Anne.

07:25.792 --> 07:27.083
Have I ever been wrong

07:25.792 --> 07:27.083
about anyth...

07:27.125 --> 07:28.917
It has ganache.

07:37.917 --> 07:40.125
- Now, Dentist!

07:37.917 --> 07:40.125
Do the face crusher!

07:40.166 --> 07:41.750
- I thought we were doing

07:40.166 --> 07:41.750
the face stomper!

07:41.792 --> 07:44.125
- Just do something

07:41.792 --> 07:44.125
to their face!

[phone ringing]

07:57.250 --> 08:00.250
Miles' phone is locked.

07:57.250 --> 08:00.250
Do you know the password?

08:00.291 --> 08:03.166
- No.

08:00.291 --> 08:03.166
But he loves my cat,

08:03.208 --> 08:05.333
so try, "I love Debbie."

08:08.583 --> 08:10.166
- No, nothing.

08:10.208 --> 08:12.875
- Then he probably uses

08:10.208 --> 08:12.875
his fingerprint.

08:12.917 --> 08:15.667
- His fingerprint?

08:12.917 --> 08:15.667
- Is that a problemo?

08:16.709 --> 08:19.250
- No, no, no,

08:16.709 --> 08:19.250
no problemo.

08:50.542 --> 08:52.166
[grunting]

08:53.041 --> 08:55.291
- Sorry, but there's

08:53.041 --> 08:55.291
an embarrassing message

08:55.333 --> 08:57.417
from Mae on Miles' phone,

08:55.333 --> 08:57.417
and I need you to help me

08:57.458 --> 09:01.125
get his fingerprint

08:57.458 --> 09:01.125
so I can unlock it and erase it.

09:01.166 --> 09:04.333
so why should I help you?

09:04.375 --> 09:05.875
- Because I'm your sister.

- Yes, but you're

09:05.917 --> 09:07.792
still not a dude.

09:07.834 --> 09:10.083
- Yeah, well Miles is

09:07.834 --> 09:10.083
your friend; he's a dude.

09:10.125 --> 09:12.792
- But you're still not!

09:10.125 --> 09:12.792
- Listen, dude!

09:12.834 --> 09:14.250
If Miles hears that message,

09:14.291 --> 09:15.709
he's gonna get

I don't want anything

She can't be here.

10:10.834 --> 10:12.208

10:12.250 --> 10:13.834
- There are time-honored

10:12.250 --> 10:13.834
traditions

10:13.875 --> 10:15.333
that must be followed.

10:13.875 --> 10:15.333

to use the backyard

10:15.375 --> 10:17.500
as a bathroom.

Okay, I'm alone.

12:20.125 --> 12:21.875
What's up?

- Wait, before we go

12:21.917 --> 12:24.667
any further,

12:24.709 --> 12:26.875
who wears corduroy

12:24.709 --> 12:26.875
cargo shorts?

12:26.917 --> 12:29.166
- Mostly boat owners

12:26.917 --> 12:29.166
and men of leisure.

12:29.208 --> 12:31.208
- Okay, can we forget

12:29.208 --> 12:31.208
about the shorts?

12:31.250 --> 12:32.917
What's going on?

12:32.959 --> 12:34.834
- There's a problem

12:32.959 --> 12:34.834
with Mae and Miles.

12:34.875 --> 12:37.166
- Yeah, we've got trouble

12:34.875 --> 12:37.166
in paradise.

12:37.208 --> 12:39.125
- What does that mean?

12:39.166 --> 12:41.667
- It usually indicates when

12:39.166 --> 12:41.667
a couple is having trouble--

12:41.709 --> 12:45.709
- Okay, I know what it means,

12:41.709 --> 12:45.709
but what does it<i> mean</i> ?

12:45.750 --> 12:47.834
- We just overheard Miles

12:45.750 --> 12:47.834
tell Dooley

12:47.875 --> 12:50.083
how he really feels

12:47.875 --> 12:50.083
about Mae.

12:50.125 --> 12:53.709
- Yeah, and let's just say

12:50.125 --> 12:53.709
it wasn't so paradise-y.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.208
- Why are you

12:53.750 --> 12:55.208
telling me this?

12:55.250 --> 12:57.041
Now I have no choice

12:55.250 --> 12:57.041
but to tell Mae.

12:57.083 --> 12:59.333
She's my best friend.

12:57.083 --> 12:59.333
- Well, our other option

12:59.375 --> 13:00.917
was handling it ourselves.

13:00.959 --> 13:03.041
- You made

13:00.959 --> 13:03.041
the right choice.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.542
Did Miles say

13:03.083 --> 13:04.542
anything else,

13:04.583 --> 13:06.375
like why he's

13:04.583 --> 13:06.375
feeling this way?

13:06.417 --> 13:09.875
- Well, we didn't exactly

13:06.417 --> 13:09.875
hear the whole conversation.

13:09.917 --> 13:13.208
- Okay, well I can't tell Mae

13:09.917 --> 13:13.208
unless I have more information.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.083
I need you guys to figure out

13:13.250 --> 13:16.083
why there's trouble in paradise.

13:16.125 --> 13:18.291
Can you handle that?

13:16.125 --> 13:18.291
- If we were good handlers,

13:18.333 --> 13:20.291
we wouldn't have called you

13:18.333 --> 13:20.291
in the first place.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.417
- Just handle it!

13:25.875 --> 13:27.542
- Hey, Miley-mi,

13:25.875 --> 13:27.542
random question.

13:27.583 --> 13:29.208
Not prompted by anything at all.

13:29.250 --> 13:31.834
Earlier, when you said

13:29.250 --> 13:31.834
you don't like her,

13:31.875 --> 13:35.542
exactly why don't you like her?

13:35.583 --> 13:37.500
- Well, I don't want this

13:35.583 --> 13:37.500
getting back to Mae.

13:37.542 --> 13:38.959
You know, you promise

13:37.542 --> 13:38.959
you won't tell?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.166
- No, of course not.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.166
- Promise.

13:40.208 --> 13:41.542
- Bro code.

13:41.583 --> 13:43.625
- She's just so moody,

13:41.583 --> 13:43.625
you know?

13:43.667 --> 13:46.125
Sometimes I'm talking to her,

13:43.667 --> 13:46.125
and she just walks away

13:46.166 --> 13:47.709
to stare at birds

13:46.166 --> 13:47.709
out the window.

13:47.750 --> 13:49.125
- She does?

13:47.750 --> 13:49.125
- That's weird.

13:49.166 --> 13:52.333
- Ooh, a blue jay!

13:52.375 --> 13:54.917
- Truthfully,

13:52.375 --> 13:54.917
it makes me not even want
