You heard what the doctor said.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.234
Who could understand her?

00:26.317 --> 00:29.112
I am fluent in mambo,
not mumbo jumbo.

00:30.447 --> 00:33.867
Well, as a future nurse practitioner,
let me explain her diagnosis.

I don't trust that doctor.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.623
The first thing she did was weigh me,

00:40.707 --> 00:44.127

was clouded by jealousy.

Abuelita,

need to start using your cane to walk.

Why should I have to use a cane

01:02.353 --> 01:03.438
I'm serious.

01:03.521 --> 01:04.981
I want to see you using that cane.

what everybody else should do.

that you're taller than my armpit.

And I am Lorenzo's colleague, Schneider.

12:29.123 --> 12:29.957
Avery.

12:30.666 --> 12:33.544
So are you a parent
or a teacher or a student?

12:33.627 --> 12:34.879
Please don't say student.

12:36.338 --> 12:37.298
Well, I'm...

12:37.381 --> 12:40.217
I teach kindergarten.
But really I'm a poet.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.094
I'm selling custom poems.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.095
No kidding.

12:43.179 --> 12:46.265
I type them onto paper I make at home
from recycled phone books.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.350
And my ribbon is loaded
with cuttlefish ink.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.562
Cuttlefish is my favorite cephalopod ink.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.939
-How's business?
-Not great.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.444
Oh, a customer!

12:58.527 --> 12:59.904
Catch you later, neighbor.

13:00.488 --> 13:01.322
Hi.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.827
Did I eat soft cheese?

13:10.748 --> 13:12.750
Let's see how many bids we have, huh?

13:13.667 --> 13:15.836
-Ay.
-Oh, sugar.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.263
These boots were not made for walking.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.309
Leslie, back to the corral!

13:30.392 --> 13:31.227
Elena's coming.

13:34.688 --> 13:37.483
Dr. Berkowitz,
why are you wearing cowboy boots?

13:37.566 --> 13:41.278
There's a long-storied history
of Jewish cowboys.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.573
Yippee-ki-oy vey!

13:48.953 --> 13:51.956
Abuelita, you can't be wearing
those high heels,

13:52.039 --> 13:54.083
and what happened to the knitting lessons?

13:54.166 --> 13:56.502
You are putting yourself
in serious danger.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.546
You're not some kid
at the Havana club anymore,

13:58.629 --> 13:59.880
you're an old woman.

13:59.964 --> 14:02.925
And you think an old woman could do this?

14:03.384 --> 14:06.387
[vocalizes in rhythm]

14:07.388 --> 14:08.222
Woo!

14:11.851 --> 14:12.685
Fine.

14:13.143 --> 14:16.689
Clearly you don't care what Mom
or me or the doctor says.

14:18.482 --> 14:19.316
I give up.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.778
That was very impressive.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.781
Most women your age
would have twisted an ankle.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.033
[hoarsely] I did.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.536
[groans]

14:35.499 --> 14:36.375
[clears throat]

14:37.501 --> 14:39.628
Is Belmondo acting up?

14:39.712 --> 14:40.796
Sure is.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.881
Keys are jammed.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.382
Oh. Let me take a look.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.056
You're really good with those tools.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.224
Oh, thanks.

14:52.683 --> 14:54.977
I like pretty much anything mechanical.

14:55.936 --> 15:01.692
To me, all these gears, springs,
and levers working in unison is like...

15:02.776 --> 15:04.695
poetry, you know?

15:05.988 --> 15:06.906
I do.

15:07.990 --> 15:12.286
Plus, with a typewriter, you can
create something that lasts forever.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.414
Something permanent you can...

15:16.665 --> 15:18.751
you can hold and cherish.

15:21.378 --> 15:22.379
[typewriter dings]

15:30.346 --> 15:31.972
Belmondo is fixed.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.767
Oh! Are you okay?

15:36.018 --> 15:37.561
All right, Abuelita, time to go.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.272
And no need to be dramatic.
You win.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.483
You're free to make your own choices
about your health,

15:42.566 --> 15:45.319
even if those choices are stupid
and can put you back in a coma.

15:45.402 --> 15:47.404
You finally get it.

15:50.950 --> 15:51.867
[winces]

15:54.620 --> 15:56.246
[chuckles]

15:56.330 --> 16:00.000
Interesting items.

16:00.918 --> 16:01.752
Abuelita.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.253
Did you hurt yourself?

16:03.337 --> 16:04.713
Don't be ridiculous.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.674
I'm simply interested in vaginal...

16:18.852 --> 16:20.062
I hurt my ankle.

16:21.188 --> 16:22.022
Okay.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.693
Dr. B. Can you please give us a hand?
We need to get her to the car.

16:25.776 --> 16:26.610
Of course.

16:26.694 --> 16:27.820
[yells]

16:32.032 --> 16:34.618
[Dr. Berkowitz]
I might need some help as well.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.414
I've been outbid.

16:38.497 --> 16:39.707
You have? By who?

16:40.249 --> 16:41.083
By me.

16:44.253 --> 16:47.089
Well, I have a tradition
to maintain, so...

16:49.383 --> 16:51.719
Well, I'm not much for tradition, so...

17:01.061 --> 17:02.563
I've had this dream.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.194
This is getting boring.
[clears throat]

17:13.240 --> 17:16.702
Whoa, she wrote a lot of zeros
and turned two of them in the boobs.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.706
I, um... I can't compete with that.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.876
Will you excuse me for one second?

17:25.252 --> 17:26.086
Yeah.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.215
No, Nikki. No, no, no.

17:32.301 --> 17:36.597
I'm breaking this cycle,
this dance of death that we do.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.098
I know Avery and I just met,

17:38.182 --> 17:41.435
but she's making me feel things
that I've never felt before.

17:41.518 --> 17:42.603
Okay, bring her.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.824
Really? No, no, no, no!

17:58.660 --> 17:59.620
[exclaims]

18:00.621 --> 18:02.873
[clears throat] So...

18:03.624 --> 18:06.752
Um, did you really mean
what you said about me?

18:07.669 --> 18:08.504
Yeah.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.425
I had a really nice time
meeting you and Belmondo tonight.

18:13.509 --> 18:14.468
Us too.

18:15.636 --> 18:16.470
In fact,

18:17.304 --> 18:19.264
we wrote you a poem.

18:23.060 --> 18:23.894
Oh.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.271
This is really...

18:27.397 --> 18:29.316
experimental. [chuckles]

18:29.399 --> 18:30.442
That's my phone number.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.073
Got ya.

18:37.157 --> 18:37.991
Thanks.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.744
I will be calling.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.872
Wow, it's just-- it's so refreshing

18:43.956 --> 18:45.499
to meet someone at one of these things

18:45.582 --> 18:48.210
that isn't a a privileged, rich,
trust-fund baby.

18:53.841 --> 18:57.136
We are so on the same page. It's crazy.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.934
Congratulations, we did it.

19:04.476 --> 19:05.978
[both] Woo-woo!

19:07.521 --> 19:09.356
Yeah, we did such a great job

19:09.439 --> 19:11.984
that Nikki will take all the credit
for it at the PTA meeting.

19:14.653 --> 19:15.737
Hey, you know what?

19:15.821 --> 19:18.699
I was thinking that you and me,
we should go out sometime.

19:19.992 --> 19:20.826
Go out?

19:20.909 --> 19:22.870
Yeah, you know, grab a drink, see a movie.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.706
Call the heat lamp company, start yelling.
I don't know, date stuff.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.084
Um...

19:31.128 --> 19:32.337
I don't think we should.

19:34.506 --> 19:35.340
Okay.

19:35.924 --> 19:38.218
I mean, you're the only parent here
I actually like.

19:38.302 --> 19:39.761
We're friends.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.138
I'd really hate to mess that up.

19:41.221 --> 19:42.181
-Right?
-Right, yeah.

19:42.264 --> 19:45.434
Then we'd be stuck with each other
for four more awkward years.

19:45.517 --> 19:46.435
Yeah, no, totally.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.270
But I am so flattered.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.272
-'Cause you--
-Yeah, I know, all good.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.358
I hope I didn't make it weird.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.902
No, come on, no. All good.

20:02.075 --> 20:05.245
[sighs] Here you go, Abuelita.
This should help with the swelling.

20:05.829 --> 20:06.663
Thank you.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.794
Now can we talk about
getting rid of the high heels?

20:12.878 --> 20:14.129
-[sighs]
-Elena, please,

20:14.213 --> 20:15.839
give the woman a moment's peace.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.343
I'm just used to taking her side.

20:19.426 --> 20:21.428
I don't even know what you guys
are talking about.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.019
Abuelita...

20:30.812 --> 20:31.688
please.

20:32.356 --> 20:36.151
I haven't slept since I saw you
lying in that hospital bed.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.488
I am so worried that something
is going to happen to you,

20:39.571 --> 20:42.991
and you're being stubborn
about a silly pair of shoes.

20:44.743 --> 20:45.577
Mija.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.581
It's not just about the shoes.

20:50.666 --> 20:53.502
It's... once the heels go,

20:54.253 --> 20:55.170
what's next?

20:56.213 --> 21:01.093
I don't want to put them on a shelf
and remember who I was.

21:02.052 --> 21:04.846
I want to be who I am.

21:05.931 --> 21:06.890
My abuela,

21:07.516 --> 21:08.433
Maria Luisa.

21:09.142 --> 21:13.230
She wore her four-inch
ruby stilettos everywhere,

21:13.313 --> 21:14.648
even snorkeling.

21:18.193 --> 21:21.363
Oh, boy, she was a strong woman.

21:23.031 --> 21:25.867
And she remained elegant.

21:27.202 --> 21:30.789
In spite of living in the world
that was not always beautiful.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.794
And she was who she was.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.381
Until the day she died.

21:43.844 --> 21:46.513
-I also have a really strong abuelita.
-[chuckles]

21:48.056 --> 21:49.641
And I want to keep her strong.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.562
So do you think that...

21:54.438 --> 21:56.732
she can be who she is

21:57.232 --> 21:58.942
in a slightly lower heel?

22:01.153 --> 22:02.029
For me?

22:04.239 --> 22:05.115
For you?

22:07.409 --> 22:08.827
Maybe she could try.

22:10.370 --> 22:13.332
If the shoes are sufficiently stylish,

22:13.415 --> 22:15.751
with a little platform,
and a bit of sparkle.

22:18.962 --> 22:19.796
Deal.

22:20.255 --> 22:21.089
Okay.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.721
And you know, maybe sometimes
you can use the cane.

22:27.804 --> 22:29.097
-Take the win.
-Okay.

22:33.477 --> 22:35.062
I want to make an announcement.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.147
Mami, what happened to the motor?

22:37.230 --> 22:39.149
Oh, so tragic.

22:40.317 --> 22:43.612
It broke when it was hit several times

22:43.695 --> 22:45.822
by a cane, which also broke.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.284
So what's your announcement?

22:49.368 --> 22:53.330
I realize that there are many things
I still want to do with my life.

22:53.955 --> 22:56.375
So I made a bouquet list.

23:02.297 --> 23:03.924
Do you mean a bucket list?

23:04.508 --> 23:05.759
No, that makes no sense.

23:07.719 --> 23:09.513
It is a bouquet list

23:09.596 --> 23:14.351
because it is an arrangement of all of
the beautiful things you still want to do

23:14.476 --> 23:15.727
before you kick the bucket.

23:20.982 --> 23:21.900
What'd you put on it?

23:22.943 --> 23:25.237
To sing in front of a big band again,

hold my grandchildren's children,

23:27.239 --> 23:29.199
have someone explain Star Wars to me.

23:31.368 --> 23:32.411
Okay.

"A long time ago

23:33.662 --> 23:36.498

-Check. Done.

[knock on door]

Mateo? Is everything okay?

23:44.339 --> 23:46.425
-Can I talk to you for a sec?
-Sure.

23:48.844 --> 23:49.928
What's up?

23:50.470 --> 23:53.598
Earlier you asked if I wanted
to go out with you and I said no.

23:53.682 --> 23:54.724
I remember.

23:54.808 --> 23:56.726
I said I wanted to protect the friendship.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.437
Yeah, that happened like an hour ago.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.647
I remember stuff,
I'm not freaking Memento.

24:01.231 --> 24:04.067
I actually don't want
to be friends with you.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.403
Okay, well, that could have been an email.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.531
Sorry. I'm not great at this.

24:10.365 --> 24:11.575
It's been 15 years.

24:13.118 --> 24:15.245
The thing is,
when you spilled water on your...

24:18.665 --> 24:20.876
It's like I saw you in a brand new way.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.211
Huh! Interesting. Go on.

24:24.379 --> 24:26.465
And then you asked me out and I panicked.

24:26.548 --> 24:29.468
I mean, I haven't been on a date
since I split with my wife.

24:29.551 --> 24:30.385
Mateo...

24:31.720 --> 24:33.138
Are you asking me on a date?

24:34.097 --> 24:34.931
I am.

24:37.225 --> 24:40.937
I actually started thinking about it
and I don't think it's a good idea.

24:43.064 --> 24:44.483
Remember five seconds ago

24:44.566 --> 24:47.319
when you asked me out,
I said no, but I meant to say yes?

24:48.945 --> 24:50.363
[Lydia] Stop toying with the man!

24:50.447 --> 24:53.783
Invite him in so he can see
what you will look like in ten years!
