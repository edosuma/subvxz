00:38.342 --> 00:40.633
<i>I once heard a man say that, in Africa,</i>

00:40.717 --> 00:43.800
<i>the sun is like a furnace
that either melts you...</i>

00:44.383 --> 00:45.425
<i>or forges you.</i>

02:02.050 --> 02:03.800
Everything...

02:03.883 --> 02:05.592
that is underneath this earth

02:05.675 --> 02:08.883
belongs to all our people.

02:10.092 --> 02:11.717
Does not belong to the Belgians.

02:12.592 --> 02:14.633
Does not belong to the Americans.

02:16.300 --> 02:18.633
Does not belong to you, <i>mon frère</i>.

02:19.925 --> 02:21.633
That's one way to look at it.

02:25.008 --> 02:26.300
Here's another.

03:23.300 --> 03:27.717
The Congo is a provider of over half of...

03:27.800 --> 03:30.592
more than half of the world's copper

03:30.675 --> 03:34.508
and cobalt to the USA and the USSR.

03:35.550 --> 03:37.383
Both of these minerals essential...

03:37.467 --> 03:41.633
Both of these minerals necessary to
the superpowers' weapons-guidance systems.

03:43.050 --> 03:44.717
We should not stand idly...

03:44.800 --> 03:48.050
No. We cannot stand idly by...

03:48.133 --> 03:51.300
while General Tshombe
colludes with the mining companies

03:51.383 --> 03:53.383
to control the province of Katanga.

03:54.092 --> 03:56.967
And with the assassination
of Prime Minister Lumumba,

03:57.050 --> 04:01.300
we now have a moral imperative
to send in more peacekeepers.

04:01.383 --> 04:04.425
The United Nations,
in deference to the Congo's wishes,

04:04.508 --> 04:06.133
has asked that, once again,

04:06.217 --> 04:08.467
these peacekeepers come from Ireland.

04:09.383 --> 04:13.217
Apart from serving as head
of the United Nations' Congo Division,

04:13.300 --> 04:14.592
I'm an Irishman myself.

04:15.633 --> 04:19.425
Therefore, I am very proud
that we've been asked to serve.

04:32.008 --> 04:34.008
You see Caesar, he knew.

04:35.092 --> 04:36.217
I'll be the first to go.

04:37.383 --> 04:40.633
- Are you lads in the Congo mission?
- We are, yeah.

04:40.717 --> 04:41.633
Sit down.

04:41.717 --> 04:44.092
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah, Guinness.

04:44.175 --> 04:46.258
P? Four, please.

04:46.342 --> 04:48.217
Everyone else was cracking.

04:48.300 --> 04:52.300
That's why you get 200,000 people
surrendering to 60,000.

04:52.383 --> 04:53.550
That's the difference.

04:54.133 --> 04:55.133
Now, the thing is,

04:55.217 --> 04:58.050
politicians,
they don't understand tactics.

04:58.675 --> 05:01.300
And soldiers,
they don't understand strategy.

05:01.383 --> 05:04.050
But Caesar, he understood both.

05:04.133 --> 05:05.508
Julius Caesar in the corner.

05:06.842 --> 05:09.758
He's read it all.
He knows every battle ever fought.

05:09.842 --> 05:12.967
- Does he know about the real thing?
- None of us do.

05:17.508 --> 05:18.800
Remember who's in charge.

05:20.633 --> 05:22.175
He's your commanding officer.

05:24.467 --> 05:25.508
Yes, sir.

05:28.425 --> 05:30.342
You could have said something.

05:30.425 --> 05:31.925
You're a fucking idiot!

05:35.342 --> 05:36.508
Commandant.

05:37.217 --> 05:39.008
Sure only my wife calls me that.

05:39.092 --> 05:40.383
One for my friend, please.

05:43.092 --> 05:46.800
- Are you looking forward to it?
- Looking forward to the challenge.

05:48.092 --> 05:51.717
- The men are looking forward to it, too.
- And I hope they're ready for it.

05:53.258 --> 05:54.508
What do you think?

05:54.592 --> 05:56.342
Will we see any action?

05:56.425 --> 05:59.883
Who knows? I don't think any of us
have a clue what's going on out there.

06:09.633 --> 06:10.842
Your dinner's in the dog.

06:11.925 --> 06:14.508
I was being delightful and witty company.

06:14.592 --> 06:16.467
Ah, that's a nice change for you.

06:17.508 --> 06:19.300
A lesser man
might take that the wrong way.

06:19.925 --> 06:20.758
Might he?

06:21.758 --> 06:23.217
Well, I would only be guessing.

06:24.717 --> 06:25.758
I love this song.

06:26.925 --> 06:28.217
Come here. Come here.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.675
- Can we dance to this?
- No.

06:46.217 --> 06:47.258
That'll be them.

06:47.925 --> 06:48.967
Making it official.

06:56.175 --> 06:57.217
Hold that thought.

07:09.633 --> 07:10.675
Jadotville.

07:10.758 --> 07:12.342
<i>In the Katanga region.</i>

07:12.425 --> 07:14.008
Yes, General. I understand.

07:14.592 --> 07:16.217
<i>Report 0600 hours.</i>

07:16.717 --> 07:17.758
Okay.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.883
Aren't you excited as all hell to go?

07:35.342 --> 07:37.842
Don't you want to see
if you're as good as you think?

07:52.300 --> 07:55.925
Hey. Hey. Hey, yes, hey.

07:56.008 --> 07:57.383
Hey. Hey.

07:57.467 --> 07:58.508
Donnelly.

08:05.717 --> 08:06.758
Trousers.

08:16.550 --> 08:17.925
Sweet Jesus!

08:23.592 --> 08:24.842
Is it going to be sore?

08:27.342 --> 08:28.383
I can't watch.

08:32.133 --> 08:33.174
This won't hurt.

08:36.508 --> 08:37.549
Hi.

08:43.549 --> 08:46.592
My fiancée is a nurse.
She said this will be all right.

08:50.175 --> 08:51.217
Fuck.

08:56.592 --> 08:57.675
Is that it?

08:58.300 --> 09:00.133
You know I'm shipping off to war, yeah?

09:02.925 --> 09:05.758
I might die without knowing the love
of a good Irish woman.

09:26.633 --> 09:27.842
I'll be all right.

09:30.217 --> 09:31.675
Do you have your coat now?

09:31.758 --> 09:34.467
Ma, we're going to the feckin' equator.

09:34.550 --> 09:36.758
Better watch your feckin' language
in Africa!

09:49.717 --> 09:51.008
So, you are on your way.

09:51.925 --> 09:52.967
Yeah.

09:54.758 --> 09:56.050
Your mother will miss you.

09:57.092 --> 09:58.133
Dad?

09:58.217 --> 09:59.258
Yeah?

10:01.258 --> 10:03.550
I had a dream I'm going to die over there.

10:05.217 --> 10:06.508
There's no chance of that.

10:07.217 --> 10:10.633
Your mother will pray for you.
You know she's got a direct line to God.

10:13.633 --> 10:14.592
<i>Company!</i>

10:16.217 --> 10:17.842
<i>Attention!</i>

10:20.717 --> 10:24.133
The UN was established
to ensure that the nations of the world

10:24.217 --> 10:25.592
would never again engage

10:25.675 --> 10:27.258
in another world war.

10:30.050 --> 10:32.758
We are the second wave of Irish soldiers

10:32.842 --> 10:34.550
to be sent into the Congo.

10:36.092 --> 10:39.300
So far, it has cost nine Irish lives.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.717
So this is where it gets serious

10:43.800 --> 10:45.217
for every single one of us.

10:47.717 --> 10:49.467
Nobody has shot at you,

10:49.550 --> 10:51.008
tried to kill you before.

10:52.592 --> 10:54.092
You are war virgins.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.425
The UN has given us this great honor,

10:59.508 --> 11:01.175
to serve as peacekeepers.

11:02.467 --> 11:04.092
And we are proud to accept.

11:06.925 --> 11:08.300
We are a country

11:08.383 --> 11:11.550
that has never owned or tried to conquer

11:11.633 --> 11:12.967
another sovereign nation.

11:14.550 --> 11:15.675
As a neutral country,

11:15.758 --> 11:18.258
Ireland has chosen
to never be the aggressor.

11:18.967 --> 11:20.425
That's why they have asked for us.

11:22.592 --> 11:24.925
And if anybody thinks
we're to be taken lightly...

11:26.175 --> 11:27.508
we'll show them

11:27.592 --> 11:30.050
that they are very sadly mistaken.

11:32.383 --> 11:33.508
Am I right, soldiers?

11:33.592 --> 11:35.133
Yes, sir!

11:47.258 --> 11:48.717
Carry on, Company Sergeant.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.842
Yes, sir.

11:51.758 --> 11:52.800
<i>Company!</i>

11:53.883 --> 11:56.258
<i>Left turn!</i>

11:58.467 --> 12:01.425
<i>Quick march!</i>

12:05.633 --> 12:07.342
Hey. Hey.

12:07.425 --> 12:09.175
Hey, yes, hey.

12:16.425 --> 12:20.758
We welcome the forces
of the United Nations here with open arms

12:20.842 --> 12:22.592
but with some confusion.

12:23.883 --> 12:26.383
We don't know why you are here
in Africa...

12:27.300 --> 12:30.050
as we are quite capable
of looking after ourselves.

12:31.258 --> 12:33.883
However, we will be thoughtful hosts.

12:34.758 --> 12:36.633
Unless you come here to start trouble,

12:36.717 --> 12:37.758
in which case

12:37.842 --> 12:39.717
you will force us to tutor you

12:39.800 --> 12:42.467
on how things are done here in the Congo.

12:44.008 --> 12:46.883
- General Tshombe!
- Gentlemen, that's it. We're done.

12:47.883 --> 12:50.508
<i>I had a call from Khrushchev earlier.</i>

12:50.592 --> 12:53.800
He reminded me
of the UN's refusal to send in troops

12:53.883 --> 12:55.342
when Lumumba asked me to.

12:57.050 --> 13:00.842
It's amazing how good an atheist is
in inflicting guilt.

13:03.092 --> 13:05.758
Meanwhile,
they're building a wall in Berlin.

13:07.217 --> 13:08.300
I know.

13:08.383 --> 13:09.717
Kennedy called.

13:11.175 --> 13:13.508
What did the Sun King of Camelot
have to say?

13:13.592 --> 13:17.217
We can't do anything
in Berlin, Vietnam or Cuba,

13:17.300 --> 13:19.133
but we can defuse the Congo.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.008
And I want you to go.

13:22.842 --> 13:24.967
Put an end to General Tshombe's antics.

13:25.050 --> 13:27.133
- Send him a message.
- Excuse me?

13:27.217 --> 13:29.592
I want you to be our man on the ground.

13:29.675 --> 13:31.300
But this thing, this...

13:32.717 --> 13:34.467
could lead to another world war.

13:34.550 --> 13:36.550
Yes, and everybody sees that.

13:37.133 --> 13:39.217
So the man who stops it

13:39.300 --> 13:40.967
will get a lot of credit.

13:42.258 --> 13:43.300
We'll make up a plan.

13:44.175 --> 13:45.217
What kind of plan?

13:46.175 --> 13:47.842
One with a lot of moving parts

13:47.925 --> 13:51.175
that requires a man astute
and hard-headed enough to pull it off.

13:52.383 --> 13:54.550
We each have our part to play in history.

13:55.842 --> 13:58.092
Yours is happening right now, Conor.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.008
I believe I can...

14:04.425 --> 14:06.175
accomplish the mission, sir.

14:06.258 --> 14:07.300
Good, Conor.

14:09.008 --> 14:10.133
Good.

14:11.675 --> 14:12.925
<i>The United Nations</i>

14:13.008 --> 14:16.300
<i>are going to send
more peacekeeping troops,</i>

14:16.383 --> 14:19.592
<i>so I need your assistance,
General de Gaulle.</i>

14:19.675 --> 14:21.425
<i>And what will you give in return?</i>

14:22.008 --> 14:27.217
<i>It's in all our interests that the mining
companies continue their operations.</i>

14:27.758 --> 14:29.175
<i>My old rival</i>

14:29.258 --> 14:32.258
<i>would have nationalized
everything you own.</i>

14:32.342 --> 14:35.258
<i>If I lose power, it might still happen.</i>

14:35.342 --> 14:38.258
<i>Your American friends wouldn't like that.</i>

14:38.342 --> 14:41.925
<i>Okay, I will send you
1,000 of our best former legionnaires.</i>

14:42.008 --> 14:44.967
<i>The mining companies
will hire them as security officers,</i>

14:45.050 --> 14:46.467
<i>but you will give the orders.</i>

14:47.758 --> 14:49.467
<i>Katanga thanks you for that.</i>

14:49.550 --> 14:51.967
<i>Tell Katanga it's a pleasure.</i>

15:43.467 --> 15:45.425
All right, lads. Everybody out.

15:46.425 --> 15:49.258
Boys, you're supposed
to rehydrate. It will be fine.

15:51.217 --> 15:52.258
Lads.

15:52.342 --> 15:53.383
Picture.

15:55.133 --> 15:56.133
Cheese!

15:56.633 --> 15:57.800
You're gorgeous.

16:00.175 --> 16:02.508
Calling it a compound is a joke.

16:03.050 --> 16:06.508
We've got exposure on three approaches.
Overlooked from the south.

16:08.008 --> 16:09.800
And there's a road splitting it in two.

16:11.258 --> 16:12.383
We're wide open.

16:13.092 --> 16:14.133
Okay.

16:17.258 --> 16:18.383
Do we have shovels?

16:19.675 --> 16:20.717
We do.

16:21.258 --> 16:23.258
Have the men up for drill at 0600.

16:23.883 --> 16:24.925
Yes, sir.

16:48.717 --> 16:50.467
Dr O'Brien, how was your flight?

16:50.550 --> 16:52.258
Very pleasant, thank you, General.

16:53.217 --> 16:54.758
We have a lot to talk about.

16:54.842 --> 16:56.883
We do. May I introduce General Raja?

16:57.592 --> 16:59.633
- Welcome to the Congo, sir.
- Good to meet you.

16:59.717 --> 17:02.508
<i>Tshombe has crossed the line.
We need to stop him.</i>

17:02.592 --> 17:04.467
We're beyond the point of no return.

17:05.050 --> 17:08.800
You are therefore authorized to implement
Operation Morthor immediately.

17:08.883 --> 17:11.467
I have decided
we should take aggressive action

17:11.550 --> 17:14.133
to reclaim key buildings held by Tshombe.

17:14.217 --> 17:16.175
There's a time for talking,

17:16.258 --> 17:17.425
a time for being tough.

17:18.467 --> 17:19.508
This is the latter.

17:20.508 --> 17:21.967
Your soldiers have the distinction

17:22.050 --> 17:24.842
of being the only troops
with any real military experience.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.550
The others will be looking to them
to set an example.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.467
Show them how decisive you can be.

18:00.092 --> 18:01.300
This place is amazing.

18:05.050 --> 18:06.467
This is some job.

18:11.050 --> 18:13.467
Yahoo!

18:14.050 --> 18:17.133
Wakey-wakey! Rise and shine, boys! Whoo!

18:17.217 --> 18:18.925
Up and at 'em! Come on!

18:19.550 --> 18:20.592
Get off, Cooley, will ya?

18:28.217 --> 18:29.633
Keep digging.

18:36.592 --> 18:39.342
Fuck! Fuck! Jesus! Oh, Christ!

18:39.425 --> 18:40.758
What? What?

18:40.842 --> 18:43.008
It's a fucking snake!

18:44.217 --> 18:45.258
Snake!

18:48.175 --> 18:51.092
These ones aren't poisonous.
Did you not read the info packs?

18:51.175 --> 18:54.050
With all due respect, boss,
are you sure they're not poisonous?

19:01.300 --> 19:02.842
- Get out.
- Look out!

19:03.883 --> 19:04.967
Out, you fuckers!

19:06.050 --> 19:06.883
St Patrick himself.

19:11.675 --> 19:12.842
Back to it.

19:47.675 --> 19:49.508
Weapons are state of the art.

19:50.383 --> 19:51.717
For World War II, anyway.

19:54.050 --> 19:56.092
These things... plastic.

19:56.175 --> 19:57.217
Useless.

19:58.633 --> 20:01.883
CQMS says we have food provisions,
enough for two days.

20:01.967 --> 20:05.383
The men have their own rations, but mostly
biscuits you wouldn't feed to your dog.

20:10.883 --> 20:12.133
Time to hunt and gather.

20:12.800 --> 20:13.925
Let's go.

20:14.008 --> 20:15.050
Yes, sir.

20:34.842 --> 20:35.883
How can I help you?

20:37.383 --> 20:39.508
I'll take as much
as that truck outside can carry.

20:39.592 --> 20:40.633
Yes, sir.

20:41.717 --> 20:43.258
Where's the best bar in town?

20:43.342 --> 20:44.508
At the end of the street.

20:46.508 --> 20:49.258
I don't think you will find
any of the bars here to your liking.

20:52.050 --> 20:53.383
Why is that?

20:53.467 --> 20:54.758
I don't mean to be rude,

20:54.842 --> 20:57.425
but you do know
that you're not welcome here, don't you?

21:00.217 --> 21:01.383
I'll take one of these.

21:03.258 --> 21:05.592
The people around here
are not particularly happy

21:05.675 --> 21:07.258
with how things are working out.

21:07.342 --> 21:09.508
They didn't like Lumumba taking over.

21:10.592 --> 21:12.383
But he was elected by the people.

21:12.467 --> 21:15.467
Who didn't put a lot of thought
into what would happen to the mines

21:15.550 --> 21:16.883
when he took over.

21:16.967 --> 21:18.925
Nationalizing the minerals,

21:19.008 --> 21:20.758
throwing out the mining companies.

21:21.258 --> 21:22.758
What did he expect to happen?

21:24.467 --> 21:26.550
I don't suppose
he expected to be assassinated.

21:27.258 --> 21:28.675
I love this country,

21:28.758 --> 21:30.175
but you don't tell the companies

21:30.258 --> 21:32.217
that have been making money here
for decades

21:32.300 --> 21:34.050
that they're suddenly out of business.

21:35.508 --> 21:37.342
I didn't tell them anything, madame,
but...

21:38.342 --> 21:40.008
sorry that we're not welcome here.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.008
Thank you for your time.

21:48.925 --> 21:49.967
Let's get a drink.

22:08.342 --> 22:09.342
Three beers.

22:10.717 --> 22:12.342
Won't you have a real drink?

22:18.550 --> 22:19.592
What would that be?

22:22.092 --> 22:23.133
French cognac.

22:25.633 --> 22:27.175
Perhaps you'll have one with me?

23:03.383 --> 23:04.842
Why are you here, Commandant?

23:05.633 --> 23:08.092
To protect the locals
from a man who stole power

23:08.175 --> 23:10.467
from the legitimately elected
prime minister.

23:12.675 --> 23:13.717
Why are you here?

23:14.633 --> 23:17.008
To protect the interest of the mines.

23:18.675 --> 23:20.675
Plus Paris is freezing this time of year.

23:24.717 --> 23:25.758
To Paris.

23:26.633 --> 23:27.675
To Paris.

23:36.050 --> 23:39.217
These people you're here to protect...

23:41.133 --> 23:42.800
are you sure they want you?

23:42.883 --> 23:43.925
I have my doubts.

23:44.758 --> 23:46.008
But I also have my orders.

23:47.342 --> 23:48.467
You follow all orders?

23:50.508 --> 23:51.550
I'm a soldier.

23:52.133 --> 23:53.175
That's how it's done.

23:56.008 --> 23:59.175
I looked up the Irish army
to see how many wars they have been in.

24:00.967 --> 24:02.133
You know what I found?

24:04.383 --> 24:05.467
None.

24:09.925 --> 24:11.383
And as for you, Commandant...

24:12.508 --> 24:14.008
you have never been in battle.

24:19.217 --> 24:20.467
I'm not sure about that.

24:20.967 --> 24:22.633
I've been married for ten years.

24:37.800 --> 24:38.967
Do you have a plan?

24:40.508 --> 24:42.258
Just to pray there's no need for us.

24:43.717 --> 24:46.175
Because no plan
survives contact with the enemy.

24:49.842 --> 24:51.217
That's a Rommel saying.

24:54.508 --> 24:55.758
I never liked Rommel.

24:57.592 --> 24:59.758
Not many Frenchmen like German tacticians.

25:03.925 --> 25:06.675
It only took them two weeks
to take over your entire country.

25:21.300 --> 25:23.383
You work your men too hard, I think.

25:24.842 --> 25:26.092
All of this digging.

25:28.258 --> 25:30.842
Nobody else felt the need to dig trenches.

25:38.550 --> 25:40.550
Thank you, Commandant, for your visit.

25:42.967 --> 25:44.800
Thank you for the drinks.

25:47.508 --> 25:48.633
His mercs look good.

25:49.675 --> 25:53.217
I'm not sure why he'd have such good mercs
here in the middle of nowhere.

25:54.758 --> 25:56.675
Finish and get back to the compound.

25:56.758 --> 25:57.800
Are you worried, sir?

25:59.133 --> 26:00.675
I'm worried about a lot of things.

26:06.300 --> 26:08.008
I need a house with a working phone.

26:09.925 --> 26:11.800
There's a big house beyond the compound.

26:17.467 --> 26:19.717
<i>Things are hotting up in Africa.</i>

26:20.675 --> 26:23.508
<i>Civil war is raging
in the new Republic of the Congo.</i>

26:24.592 --> 26:26.675
<i>But United Nations peacekeeping troops</i>

26:26.758 --> 26:28.092
<i>show they mean business.</i>

26:29.383 --> 26:30.508
<i>Here they are</i>

26:30.592 --> 26:34.050
<i>moving in on rebel-held
government buildings in Elisabethville...</i>

26:34.717 --> 26:36.800
<i>capital of the province of Katanga.</i>

26:42.300 --> 26:45.675
<i>The world waits
to see what General Tshombe will do next.</i>

27:06.550 --> 27:07.592
Madame.

27:08.633 --> 27:11.800
Would it be possible to use your phone
to place a call to Ireland?

27:12.425 --> 27:13.550
I'll pay, of course.

27:14.508 --> 27:17.175
I'm afraid my phone
is not for military use.

27:18.383 --> 27:19.633
It's a personal call.

27:20.383 --> 27:21.717
I need to speak to my family.

27:23.550 --> 27:24.592
Of course.

27:27.133 --> 27:29.258
Everybody's been talking about you.

27:29.342 --> 27:30.467
It's been on the news.

27:31.383 --> 27:32.425
<i>We're so proud of you.</i>

27:33.967 --> 27:35.300
I'm very happy to hear that.

27:36.675 --> 27:37.883
How are you?

27:37.967 --> 27:39.008
<i>I'm well.</i>

27:39.592 --> 27:41.467
It's hard to know what's going on here.

27:42.217 --> 27:43.967
<i>There are a lot of unknowns.</i>

27:44.675 --> 27:47.050
Don't worry, love. You'll figure it out.

27:47.133 --> 27:48.175
<i>You always do.</i>

27:49.133 --> 27:50.175
You're right.

27:52.383 --> 27:53.550
I must go.

27:53.633 --> 27:54.925
<i>I love you.</i>

27:55.008 --> 27:56.342
<i>I love you, too.</i>

27:56.425 --> 27:57.467
<i>Goodbye.</i>

28:05.633 --> 28:07.092
How is your family?

28:07.175 --> 28:08.217
All fine.

28:08.717 --> 28:10.050
I'm glad to hear that.

28:11.342 --> 28:12.300
Do you have any?

28:13.425 --> 28:14.633
I have two daughters.

28:15.758 --> 28:16.800
But I'm a widow.

28:18.425 --> 28:19.967
This place killed my husband.

28:21.342 --> 28:22.592
Radiation.

28:24.633 --> 28:27.967
The two bombs that America used
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

28:28.050 --> 28:30.008
came from the mines here in Jadotville.

28:31.300 --> 28:32.342
Uranium.

28:33.258 --> 28:34.967
The largest seam in the world.

28:36.925 --> 28:38.050
That explains a lot.

28:44.592 --> 28:45.633
Nice to meet you.

28:45.717 --> 28:46.758
And you.

29:02.425 --> 29:04.008
Take the jeep to Elisabethville

29:04.092 --> 29:06.842
and tell McEntee in person
there's a strong force of mercs here.

29:06.925 --> 29:10.092
Tell him to find out how many we're
dealing with and send reinforcements.

29:10.758 --> 29:11.800
Be nice about it.

29:58.342 --> 30:00.550
Sir. Reporting from A Company.

30:00.633 --> 30:01.800
Commandant Quinlan.

30:01.883 --> 30:04.508
Thank you, Sergeant. Take a seat.

30:10.508 --> 30:11.550
Yes, sir.

30:26.300 --> 30:27.342
Sergeant.

30:29.592 --> 30:31.883
So your commandant's
getting nervous, is he?

30:31.967 --> 30:33.550
Sir, he believes that, strategically,

30:33.633 --> 30:36.258
Jadotville is very important
to General Tshombe,

30:36.342 --> 30:38.883
and it's certainly more isolated
than any other UN compound.

30:38.967 --> 30:41.883
Might it be fair to say
that Commandant Quinlan is overreacting?

30:41.967 --> 30:45.925
Well, sir. The presence of mercenaries
would suggest that a plan is underway.

30:46.008 --> 30:48.717
A small number of mercenaries
hired as security by the mines.

30:49.717 --> 30:52.175
They would never dare attack
a United Nations company.

30:52.675 --> 30:55.425
This will all be over
before your commandant gets a suntan.

30:56.092 --> 30:57.717
I'll go and tell him that right now, sir.

30:58.717 --> 30:59.758
Thank you, Sergeant.

31:01.050 --> 31:02.383
As you were, Sergeant.

31:21.717 --> 31:23.425
Well, look at all of you.

31:26.758 --> 31:27.800
Oh-ho!

31:28.633 --> 31:29.717
Fuck.

31:32.842 --> 31:34.467
There's this girl at chapel.

31:35.842 --> 31:37.425
Mary Brannigan.

31:38.217 --> 31:40.633
I swear, she was built on springs.

31:40.717 --> 31:42.300
You should see her at Communion.

31:43.133 --> 31:44.467
Taking the Holy Ghost

31:44.550 --> 31:46.342
between those sturdy lips.

31:46.425 --> 31:49.925
Oh, Jesus, it's amazing!

31:50.008 --> 31:51.508
Cooley, that's a sin.

31:51.592 --> 31:54.383
It's all right,
we're going to Mass tomorrow.

31:54.467 --> 31:56.800
Yeah, this is worse than
my mother making me go.

31:59.300 --> 32:00.342
Reidy...

32:01.467 --> 32:02.883
what's your mother like?

32:03.758 --> 32:06.092
She's nice, yeah. Loves a good Mass.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.425
I mean what does she look like?

32:09.967 --> 32:11.008
Oh. Uh...

32:11.883 --> 32:14.258
Oh, blonde hair, blue eyes.

32:14.342 --> 32:16.508
Oh, no! Fuck off, Cooley!

32:47.508 --> 32:50.508
<i>To the escalating civil war in the Congo.</i>

32:50.592 --> 32:52.050
<i>UN peacekeeping troops</i>

32:52.133 --> 32:54.133
<i>are deployed into the Katanga region.</i>

32:54.217 --> 32:56.925
<i>With heavy fighting
in the city of Elisabethville,</i>

32:57.008 --> 32:59.425
<i>the thoughts and prayers of a proud nation</i>

32:59.508 --> 33:02.592
<i>are with our soldiers
serving the UN in the Congo.</i>

33:22.467 --> 33:24.758
Do you think O'Brien
believes his own bullshit?

33:27.008 --> 33:28.425
One hundred percent, boss.

34:07.133 --> 34:08.175
What?

34:08.550 --> 34:09.882
Operation Morthor, sir.

34:11.342 --> 34:12.675
Something went very wrong.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.882
- Sir.
- What happened?

34:26.967 --> 34:31.007
A security detail opened fire.
Return fire eliminated the troops.

34:31.092 --> 34:34.550
Then they barricaded themselves inside.
We couldn't afford a siege, so...

34:35.757 --> 34:36.800
So what?

34:36.882 --> 34:40.257
We finished them with grenades through
the windows and eliminated the enemy.

34:40.342 --> 34:43.632
- Used grenades on unarmed civilians?
- We didn't know they were unarmed.

34:43.717 --> 34:47.257
- What about ones climbing out of windows?
- They might have been armed.

34:47.342 --> 34:50.007
- So you killed innocent people?
- Yes, sir.

34:50.632 --> 34:51.592
Fuck!

34:55.467 --> 34:56.507
Fuck.

35:07.258 --> 35:08.300
This didn't happen.

35:09.258 --> 35:11.092
No mention of this in UN dispatches.

35:15.967 --> 35:17.883
We didn't just murder
30 men and women at work

35:17.967 --> 35:20.133
because the troops
lost the run of themselves.

35:24.050 --> 35:25.092
Is that clear?

35:25.592 --> 35:26.633
Yes, sir.

35:30.633 --> 35:32.467
They have just taken Radio Katanga

35:32.550 --> 35:35.008
and the government buildings
in Elisabethville.

35:35.508 --> 35:37.133
We need to retaliate.

35:39.508 --> 35:41.717

38:27.967 --> 38:30.133
Get ten of our best out there
to refuse the flank.

38:30.217 --> 38:32.133
The south flank? Sure, sir?

38:32.217 --> 38:33.258
Yes. Now, go!

38:34.758 --> 38:37.300
Yes, sir. Sniper, on me.

38:52.883 --> 38:54.675
Go now!

Let me look at you.
Get the Bren back up! Let me look!

39:14.925 --> 39:16.550
It's a scratch. You'll be fine.

39:17.342 --> 39:19.050

39:27.300 --> 39:28.967
Charlie Alpha Juliet to Control.

39:29.050 --> 39:30.342
We're under heavy attack.

39:30.425 --> 39:33.467
Send very strong reinforcements
immediately. Very urgent.

39:33.967 --> 39:35.175
<i>Operation Morthor</i>

39:35.258 --> 39:37.842
<i>has led to the suspension
of the Katangan government.</i>

39:38.342 --> 39:40.133
<i>We seized Katanga radio station</i>

39:40.217 --> 39:42.883
<i>and all communications
at 0400 hours today.</i>

39:42.967 --> 39:46.008
You attacked the enemy
without telling troops in the field?

39:46.092 --> 39:48.550
<i>The operation
has been completed successfully.</i>

39:49.092 --> 39:50.758
If the operation was a success...

39:51.758 --> 39:53.467
then why are they shooting at us?

39:56.133 --> 39:56.967
Fuck!

40:02.800 --> 40:03.842
Sniper.

40:06.467 --> 40:07.592
Go up to the trench now.

40:08.383 --> 40:09.633
Give us some cover. Go on.

40:11.383 --> 40:13.383
The rest of you, follow him. Go, go, go.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.633
Sir, there's nobody here.

40:25.550 --> 40:27.342
Because they're only coming from the east.

40:29.842 --> 40:32.133
Right, three of you stay here.

40:32.217 --> 40:34.050
The rest of you, pull back on me.

40:34.133 --> 40:35.175
Let's go.

40:35.883 --> 40:36.925
As we were.

40:38.717 --> 40:40.008
They are wide open!

40:45.550 --> 40:46.633
Use cover.

40:49.217 --> 40:50.050
Pair off.

41:03.425 --> 41:04.550
Fuck!

41:05.217 --> 41:06.258
Reidy!

41:08.675 --> 41:09.842
Magazine!

41:10.717 --> 41:12.758
Quinlan doesn't know what he's doing.

41:12.842 --> 41:14.175
He's gonna get us killed!

41:15.508 --> 41:17.092
I hope to fuck you're wrong!

41:19.258 --> 41:21.175
I'm going back for Reidy.

41:48.675 --> 41:51.758
- Am I dying?
- No, you'll be grand.

41:53.092 --> 41:54.258
Start her up!

41:59.300 --> 42:00.467
Bring her forward! Go!

42:04.925 --> 42:06.633
Cover that mad bastard!

42:40.967 --> 42:42.008
Faulques!

42:43.633 --> 42:45.342
Faulques, come on!

43:01.967 --> 43:03.383
Cease fire!

43:04.758 --> 43:05.800
Cease fire!

43:11.342 --> 43:12.258
Cease fire!

43:23.633 --> 43:26.967
- Hegarty, check positions.
- Send runners, one per trench.

43:27.050 --> 43:27.883
Yes, sir.

43:27.967 --> 43:29.342
Get me Battalion HQ.

43:59.717 --> 44:00.758
Sir.

44:01.508 --> 44:03.800
General McEntee's staff
said he's unavailable.

44:03.883 --> 44:05.258
Did you tell him we got attacked?

44:05.342 --> 44:07.675
Yes. They said,
"God bless and hold tight."

44:08.675 --> 44:10.633
"God bless"?
What's that supposed to mean?

44:10.717 --> 44:14.175
Um... I suppose he means,
"May God's blessings be upon us," sir.

44:17.217 --> 44:20.508
Start a radio log. From now on,
everything that's said goes on record.

44:21.258 --> 44:22.092
Yes, sir.

45:44.925 --> 45:46.550
I'll run position one.

45:47.133 --> 45:48.175
North flank.

45:48.258 --> 45:51.258
Company Sergeant, you run position two.

45:51.342 --> 45:52.467
East flank.

45:53.050 --> 45:53.883
Hegarty.

45:55.217 --> 45:57.092
Position three, south flank.

45:59.175 --> 46:01.425
We were told the enemy were unprepared.

46:02.050 --> 46:03.133
We were misinformed.

46:03.675 --> 46:04.758
They got lucky,

46:04.842 --> 46:06.342
but that only happens once.

46:07.425 --> 46:10.050
Remember,
none of these men have seen battle.

46:10.758 --> 46:14.467
On our next engagement, we will
overrun them with 20 times their forces.

46:16.133 --> 46:17.633
Where are we in logistics?

46:17.717 --> 46:19.258
FNs to the best marksmen.

46:19.342 --> 46:21.133
Gustafs to the officers and the NCOs.

46:21.217 --> 46:24.592
Each platoon splits the Brens and Vickers.
Donnelly is on the mortars.

46:24.675 --> 46:25.925
But, sir...

46:26.008 --> 46:27.800
they never sent us the heavy 81s.

46:28.508 --> 46:31.050
We'll finish this in one all-out victory.

46:34.133 --> 46:35.258
All right? So let's go!

46:35.342 --> 46:36.717
Let's go!

46:36.800 --> 46:39.717
The real problem's the ammo.
We've only 13,000 rounds.

46:41.050 --> 46:42.258
It's not gonna last long.

46:43.508 --> 46:45.383
Sir, I've got General McEntee.

46:52.133 --> 46:54.217
General, request an immediate update.

46:54.300 --> 46:55.967
Report your situation, Commandant.

46:56.550 --> 46:57.675
Company A, Jadotville

46:57.758 --> 46:59.758
has been under mortar
and machine-gun fire.

46:59.842 --> 47:01.592
Expect a heavy attack any moment.

47:01.675 --> 47:03.633
I sent a man. I told you this was coming.

47:03.717 --> 47:05.467
Watch yourself, Commandant.

47:06.258 --> 47:07.592
<i>General...</i>

47:07.675 --> 47:09.050
I'm in a bad situation here

47:09.133 --> 47:10.175
and I need your help.

47:10.925 --> 47:12.217
From the dead they left,

47:12.300 --> 47:14.633
I'd say
we're looking at a force of about 1,500.

47:15.717 --> 47:18.008
<i>I need you to send reinforcements
right now.</i>

47:18.550 --> 47:19.800
Send as many as you can.

47:19.883 --> 47:22.758
There's a negative exercise outcome
if we don't get them.

47:25.425 --> 47:26.467
Is that him?

47:26.550 --> 47:27.592
Mm.

47:31.008 --> 47:33.508
Commandant,
this is Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien.

47:33.592 --> 47:35.425
I urge you to stop panicking.

47:35.508 --> 47:36.550
<i>Panicking?</i>

47:36.633 --> 47:39.800
<i>With respect, sir, are you aware
of the realities on the ground?</i>

47:39.883 --> 47:41.967
I assure you I'm very well aware of them.

47:42.050 --> 47:44.550
These are the final death gasps
of Tshombe's government.

47:45.050 --> 47:46.342
I'm not sure he knows that.

47:46.842 --> 47:49.300
Hold your position.
Allow our plan to play out.

47:49.383 --> 47:50.967
<i>The plan is two days old</i>

47:51.050 --> 47:53.300
and didn't include Tshombe's mercs.

47:53.383 --> 47:55.300
What went wrong with your plan, sir?

47:55.383 --> 47:57.842
Sounds like you're looking for an excuse,
Commandant.

47:58.758 --> 48:00.842
We each have our part to play in history.

48:00.925 --> 48:02.592
Yours is happening right now.

48:02.675 --> 48:04.550
Rely on us to make sure it all works out.

48:05.133 --> 48:07.633
Sir, I don't understand
what you just said to me,

48:07.717 --> 48:10.967
and in tactical terms
I don't understand what you're doing.

48:11.050 --> 48:14.008
I have 150 boys here
and we need reinforcements.

48:14.092 --> 48:15.592
No, you listen to me, Quinlan.

48:15.675 --> 48:18.383
There are larger things at play
than you can possibly imagine.

48:18.467 --> 48:20.633
I don't give a damn
about the larger things!

48:20.717 --> 48:22.300
We're a company under siege

48:22.383 --> 48:24.217
and we require your assistance!

48:24.300 --> 48:26.592
Discuss the details with General McEntee.

48:26.675 --> 48:27.758
Jesus Christ!

48:28.675 --> 48:31.258
<i>General,
does he have a clue what he's doing?</i>

48:31.342 --> 48:34.758
All our troops in the field
are on Operation Morthor, Commandant.

48:35.383 --> 48:37.092
We don't have any reinforcements.

48:37.175 --> 48:38.217
Exactly.

48:38.592 --> 48:40.758
<i>Nobody thought this was a possibility,
did they?</i>

48:42.800 --> 48:44.217
When do our men come back in?

48:44.300 --> 48:47.175
<i>A heavy-weapons battalion's
expected here within 12 hours.</i>

48:47.800 --> 48:49.467
They'll be sent out to you immediately.

48:50.342 --> 48:51.383
Thank you, sir.

48:52.383 --> 48:53.425
One more thing.

48:54.258 --> 48:55.842
We could do with some whiskey.

48:57.717 --> 48:59.050
I'll see what I can do.

49:07.383 --> 49:08.467
Follow me.

49:11.175 --> 49:14.050
What exactly did he mean
by "negative exercise outcome"?

49:14.133 --> 49:17.883
It means that without reinforcements...
we're fucked.

49:25.633 --> 49:28.133
<i>The aggressive action
of the United Nations</i>

49:28.217 --> 49:30.717
<i>in Elisabethville is unacceptable.</i>

49:30.800 --> 49:33.092
<i>It is unfortunate for my beloved country</i>

49:33.175 --> 49:35.383
<i>that the United Nations peacekeepers</i>

49:35.467 --> 49:37.300
<i>have now become aggressors.</i>

49:38.633 --> 49:41.550
<i>Or, should I say, peace enforcers.</i>

49:42.425 --> 49:43.467
Desmond!

49:43.550 --> 49:45.883
<i>The international community
needs to realize</i>

49:45.967 --> 49:48.758
<i>that this type of imperialist intervention</i>

49:48.842 --> 49:49.883
<i>is nothing new.</i>

49:50.467 --> 49:51.717
<i>But we, Katanga...</i>

49:52.508 --> 49:53.550
Sir.

49:54.092 --> 49:56.133
I want a private meeting with Tshombe.

49:56.217 --> 49:57.258
Somewhere neutral.

49:58.675 --> 49:59.717
Just the two of us.

51:17.925 --> 51:20.050
They're coming! Get ready for it!

51:20.133 --> 51:21.300
Into your trenches!

51:34.425 --> 51:35.925
Pick your targets!

51:36.008 --> 51:37.008
Get ready!

51:49.467 --> 51:51.592
Cover up and pick a target!

51:51.675 --> 51:52.717
Stand to!

52:20.217 --> 52:22.758
Cooley, you are snatching the trigger!

52:22.842 --> 52:23.883
Slow down!

52:24.508 --> 52:27.050
Breathe, squeeze, kill!

52:27.133 --> 52:28.300
Breathe again!

52:30.550 --> 52:32.675
Good man, Cooley! Keep it up!

52:42.300 --> 52:43.217
Over here!

52:43.925 --> 52:44.758
Sniper!

52:44.842 --> 52:47.592
- Boss?
- Can you hit the schoolhouse?

52:50.717 --> 52:51.758
Yeah.

52:51.842 --> 52:53.133
Bren in a single shot.

52:53.217 --> 52:54.508
I need the Bren!

52:59.258 --> 53:00.300
Go on!

53:03.633 --> 53:04.842
The man in the white suit.

53:09.425 --> 53:10.592
Do you have his heart?

53:14.092 --> 53:15.217
Yeah, boss.

53:15.758 --> 53:16.675
Take it.

53:28.592 --> 53:30.008
Do you think he was important?

53:30.508 --> 53:34.217
If he was... we won't
have to wait too long to find out.

53:35.133 --> 53:36.217
Hey!

53:41.842 --> 53:43.550
Retreat! Retreat!

53:48.758 --> 53:50.008
Pick your targets!

54:00.175 --> 54:01.258
Cease fire!

54:02.467 --> 54:03.508
Hold your fire!

54:05.300 --> 54:06.342
Cease fire!

54:06.425 --> 54:07.717
Cease fire!

54:08.217 --> 54:09.717
Cease fire!

54:15.675 --> 54:16.967
Cease fire!

54:20.258 --> 54:22.258
We've got to clear that whole area.

54:57.467 --> 54:58.508
Cover me.

55:28.592 --> 55:29.800
Commandant Quinlan.

55:30.342 --> 55:32.633
You're a good drinker,
but not such a good soldier.

55:33.300 --> 55:35.008
And I believe I can be of help to you.

55:36.258 --> 55:38.425
That's nice of you.
How do you aim to do that?

55:38.508 --> 55:39.758
By making you see sense.

55:41.050 --> 55:43.008
You do realize that you are outnumbered

55:43.092 --> 55:44.133
by a factor of 20?

55:45.508 --> 55:46.800
I see a lot of dead men here.

55:47.550 --> 55:48.800
None of them are mine.

55:48.883 --> 55:51.342
Yet you must see
that your position is untenable.

55:52.592 --> 55:55.967
The only way to survive this
is to let the politicians sort it out.

55:56.467 --> 55:58.758
We were attacked without provocation.

55:58.842 --> 56:00.258
We responded.

56:00.342 --> 56:01.925
We will continue to respond

56:02.008 --> 56:03.300
if you continue to attack.

56:03.800 --> 56:05.508
I'm afraid I have orders to follow.

56:06.633 --> 56:07.925
I require your surrender.

56:09.300 --> 56:11.592
You're not formally recognized
to accept surrenders.

56:12.883 --> 56:14.133
But I am.

56:14.217 --> 56:15.300
I'll accept yours.

56:17.342 --> 56:18.467
That's not an option.

56:22.800 --> 56:25.717
Nevertheless,
we would like a cease fire...

56:26.592 --> 56:29.758
to send in ambulances
and remove the dead and wounded.

56:36.592 --> 56:38.175
Tell your men we have a cease fire.

56:56.175 --> 56:58.008
Use that flag as a range marker.

57:00.050 --> 57:02.717
Joyce, get the Vickers ready.
Set up a position in the chapel.

57:02.800 --> 57:04.008
Yes, sir.

57:04.633 --> 57:05.592
Murphy!

57:08.217 --> 57:09.467
Hold your fire.

58:19.342 --> 58:20.758
Boss! Boss!

58:20.842 --> 58:22.008
It's a trap!

58:22.675 --> 58:23.675
Move!

58:27.258 --> 58:28.550
Open fire!

58:30.967 --> 58:32.342
Get the mortars ready!

58:43.133 --> 58:44.342
Donnelly!

58:44.425 --> 58:45.592
Take those fuckers out!

58:46.467 --> 58:47.758
I'm on it!

58:48.633 --> 58:50.008
Get down!

58:56.592 --> 58:58.092
Incoming!

59:09.383 --> 59:10.550
Sergeant!

59:10.633 --> 59:12.092
Sergeant!

59:14.383 --> 59:15.592
Cover fire!

59:17.050 --> 59:19.175
Hegarty, get in the trench!

59:28.508 --> 59:29.592
Come here! Come here!

59:35.508 --> 59:36.925
Come on.

59:37.008 --> 59:38.842
Grab hold of my belt and don't let go.

59:38.925 --> 59:41.175
I can't see! I can't see!

59:49.925 --> 59:51.467
I'm blind! They hit my head!

59:51.550 --> 59:53.133
You're fine. You're fine.

59:53.217 --> 59:55.300
We're going for the trench, all right?

59:56.467 --> 59:57.675
Don't drop me.

59:57.758 --> 59:59.842
Yeah, boy. Fuck, okay, come on.

01:00:24.092 --> 01:00:25.342
We have to move.

01:00:26.467 --> 01:00:27.300
Go!

01:00:28.717 --> 01:00:29.592
Go! Go! Go!

01:00:33.717 --> 01:00:35.508
Target: X-ray four.

01:00:35.592 --> 01:00:37.592
Two thousand two hundred yards.

01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:42.092
Fire one!

01:01:14.342 --> 01:01:16.550
Dud. Timer blew.

01:01:16.633 --> 01:01:17.842
Bag it.

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:22.217
Fire two!

01:01:31.675 --> 01:01:33.800
Right in the red ring!

01:01:36.342 --> 01:01:38.508
That's their mortars going off.

01:01:43.008 --> 01:01:44.175
Pick your targets!

01:01:53.967 --> 01:01:55.008
Retreat!

01:02:01.967 --> 01:02:03.217
Cease fire!

01:02:03.842 --> 01:02:05.300
Cease fire!

01:02:32.675 --> 01:02:34.550
You acquitted yourself well out there.

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:42.592
What?

01:02:42.675 --> 01:02:43.508
Nothing.

01:02:44.925 --> 01:02:45.967
It was something.

01:02:50.633 --> 01:02:51.925
I felt scared.

01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:54.550
- It's only natural.
- No, that's not it.

01:02:56.467 --> 01:02:57.633
I was scared.

01:03:00.008 --> 01:03:01.758
But then... I liked it.

01:03:03.092 --> 01:03:04.133
The killing.

01:03:05.467 --> 01:03:06.925
It's what you're trained to do.

01:03:07.675 --> 01:03:08.717
You didn't like it.

01:03:12.925 --> 01:03:15.883
Each man reacts differently
to killing another man.

01:03:19.508 --> 01:03:21.092
None of us have done this before.

01:03:24.092 --> 01:03:25.258
Talk to me in a few days.

01:03:27.842 --> 01:03:29.467
Oh, you think we'll last that long?

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:42.467
How many dead at Radio Katanga?

01:03:42.550 --> 01:03:43.592
Thirty, sir.

01:03:44.175 --> 01:03:48.633
This will negate a vast reserve
of goodwill towards the organization

01:03:48.717 --> 01:03:52.092
and show that we cannot behave any better
than any single country.

01:03:52.175 --> 01:03:53.883
Sir, these things happen in war.

01:03:54.425 --> 01:03:55.550
Not in my war.

01:03:57.925 --> 01:04:00.008
What was O'Brien's role in all of this?

01:04:01.758 --> 01:04:02.925
He's a smart man, sir,

01:04:03.008 --> 01:04:06.050
but he's an academic
who thinks that everything stands still

01:04:06.133 --> 01:04:07.717
while he thinks about what to do.

01:04:12.092 --> 01:04:13.258
We are a new thing.

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:16.133
Sometimes new things stumble.

01:04:16.217 --> 01:04:17.717
But we pick ourselves up...

01:04:18.967 --> 01:04:21.550
instead of pretending
that we didn't fall.

01:04:21.633 --> 01:04:24.675
So we're going to say that,
in our first military intervention,

01:04:24.758 --> 01:04:25.592
we got it all wrong?

01:04:26.925 --> 01:04:28.383
We acknowledge the action...

01:04:29.758 --> 01:04:31.300
but we distance ourselves.

01:04:31.967 --> 01:04:33.717
It's our plan, our forces.

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.800
How do we distance ourselves?

01:04:36.383 --> 01:04:37.550
By applying blame.

01:05:00.258 --> 01:05:01.300
Dr O'Brien.

01:05:02.592 --> 01:05:03.633
General Tshombe.

01:05:06.467 --> 01:05:08.758
I would say, "Welcome to my country.

01:05:08.842 --> 01:05:10.175
Make yourself at home,"

01:05:10.258 --> 01:05:12.217
but it appears you already have.

01:05:13.717 --> 01:05:15.050
Well, there are those

01:05:15.133 --> 01:05:17.300
who might say you're a little premature

01:05:17.383 --> 01:05:19.425
in taking command of who you welcome.

01:05:20.133 --> 01:05:22.800
Would you rather my predecessor
was still in charge?

01:05:22.883 --> 01:05:25.383
The only people he welcomed
were the communists.

01:05:25.467 --> 01:05:28.425
Or perhaps
you would rather we send all our cobalt,

01:05:28.508 --> 01:05:31.175
copper and uranium to the USSR?

01:05:33.133 --> 01:05:34.300
Of course not, General.

01:05:35.217 --> 01:05:38.217
It's just you haven't been elected
to the office you claim to hold.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:41.217
I am merely saying that Katanga,

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.342
my province,

01:05:42.425 --> 01:05:44.008
is no longer part of the Congo...

01:05:44.967 --> 01:05:46.342
and I am its president.

01:05:46.883 --> 01:05:49.300
Yes, well, that's a little like Texas

01:05:49.383 --> 01:05:52.008
saying it's no longer part of the USA,

01:05:52.092 --> 01:05:54.675
that its oil
gives it the power to do that.

01:05:55.883 --> 01:05:57.675
Factually, that would be correct.

01:05:58.217 --> 01:05:59.508
They were part of Mexico.

01:06:00.050 --> 01:06:02.300
America land-grabbed Texas.

01:06:02.383 --> 01:06:04.508
Sir, I would like to see
an end to the conflict

01:06:04.592 --> 01:06:07.508
between the United Nations
and those loyal to you in Katanga.

01:06:07.592 --> 01:06:11.883
Then recognize Katanga's
legitimate government and president

01:06:11.967 --> 01:06:14.342
in a United Nations resolution.

01:06:18.925 --> 01:06:21.717
That's... simply not being realistic.

01:06:30.967 --> 01:06:32.967
Do you think we did not hear the rumors

01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:35.342
about the Radio Katanga massacre?

01:06:37.717 --> 01:06:38.758
Rumors? Well...

01:06:40.842 --> 01:06:42.883
- They're inaccurate.
- I don't think so.

01:06:44.008 --> 01:06:46.592
I think the United Nations,

01:06:46.675 --> 01:06:50.508
this paragon of virtue and fairness...

01:06:51.717 --> 01:06:54.092
executed my loyalists.

01:06:55.383 --> 01:06:56.425
Hm?

01:06:58.008 --> 01:07:00.508
Sir, I'm sure we can find a way

01:07:00.592 --> 01:07:02.633
to draw ourselves back from the brink.

01:07:02.717 --> 01:07:07.592
Then recognize Katanga's
legitimate government and president

01:07:07.675 --> 01:07:10.550
in a United Nations resolution.

01:07:12.133 --> 01:07:13.883
That's simply not going to happen.

01:07:13.967 --> 01:07:16.633
Then enough of this, Dr O'Brien.

01:07:18.633 --> 01:07:21.092
The United Nations went from peacekeeping

01:07:21.175 --> 01:07:22.467
to peace enforcement.

01:07:23.717 --> 01:07:25.133
And your mission has failed.

01:07:30.717 --> 01:07:33.175
Did you forget about your fellow Irishmen

01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:34.550
left out in the field?

01:07:35.842 --> 01:07:37.008
What do you mean?

01:07:37.092 --> 01:07:38.133
Because I didn't.

01:07:40.342 --> 01:07:42.008
I didn't forget about them at all.

01:07:55.467 --> 01:07:58.717
My boys are giving everything they've got,
but there's just not enough of us.

01:07:59.258 --> 01:08:02.550
I give you my word, you'll have
reinforcements with you tomorrow.

01:08:03.175 --> 01:08:05.425
We'll hold out
until our last bullet's spent.

01:08:05.967 --> 01:08:07.425
We could do with that whiskey.

01:08:14.383 --> 01:08:16.216
They're going after the ammo hut!

01:08:18.133 --> 01:08:19.175
Go, move!

01:08:25.716 --> 01:08:27.175
Get this out of here! Go!

01:08:31.591 --> 01:08:32.716
- Go!
- Run!

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:33.966
Grab this one.

01:08:56.133 --> 01:08:57.716
That will be blowing up all night.

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:03.216
We'd better get our reinforcements
tomorrow.

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:04.466
We'd fucking better.

01:09:05.591 --> 01:09:07.258
<i>Mr Secretary General,</i>

01:09:07.341 --> 01:09:10.258
in view of your failure
to prevent civil war in the Congo,

01:09:10.341 --> 01:09:13.258
President Kennedy
has personally told me to insist

01:09:13.341 --> 01:09:15.591
that the United States play a larger part

01:09:15.675 --> 01:09:19.050
in your mishandled military adventure.

01:09:19.133 --> 01:09:20.758
Please tell President Kennedy

01:09:20.841 --> 01:09:22.300
that I appreciate the offer.

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:26.050
You are aware
that if you had responded sooner

01:09:26.133 --> 01:09:29.591
to Prime Minister Lumumba's
request for UN intervention,

01:09:29.675 --> 01:09:31.758
we would not be where we are today.

01:09:31.841 --> 01:09:34.383
We might well have arrived here
by other means.

01:09:34.466 --> 01:09:36.966
Has General Tshombe
even accepted a cease fire yet?

01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:39.425
He has not. That's my first priority.

01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:40.633
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:09:42.425 --> 01:09:44.383
- Sir?
- Call Tshombe directly.

01:09:45.258 --> 01:09:48.133
Tell him that the Secretary General
of the United Nations

01:09:48.216 --> 01:09:50.091
is flying to meet with him in the Congo.

01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:53.091
See if that gets his attention.

01:10:06.883 --> 01:10:08.467
Would you like to say a few words?

01:10:17.217 --> 01:10:18.467
They poisoned the water.

01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:21.258
Take what you can from the barrels.
It's all we have. Do it now.

01:10:25.258 --> 01:10:27.008
- Cooley, get more buckets.
- Yes, sir.

01:10:31.592 --> 01:10:34.508
Radio! That'll be our reinforcements.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:39.842
What are you hearing?

01:10:41.008 --> 01:10:43.008
Nothing of ours, if that's what you mean.

01:10:45.592 --> 01:10:46.633
Let's go!

01:10:53.133 --> 01:10:54.842
Is that my reinforcements I hear?

01:10:54.925 --> 01:10:57.092
Kane's platoon are at the bridge.

01:10:57.883 --> 01:11:00.050
Thirty men?
What happened to the battalion?

01:11:00.633 --> 01:11:02.092
<i>It's all we could get.</i>

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:03.967
<i>They're under heavy bombardment.</i>

01:11:05.092 --> 01:11:06.675
<i>They may have to pull back.</i>

01:11:06.758 --> 01:11:08.550
Our only hope is that you reach us!

01:11:08.633 --> 01:11:10.092
<i>I'll try to get through to them.</i>

01:11:29.425 --> 01:11:31.967
We're facing bigger numbers
than we were advised!

01:11:32.050 --> 01:11:33.092
<i>We have to pull out!</i>

01:11:33.175 --> 01:11:34.800
<i>Pull back! Pull back!</i>

01:11:35.675 --> 01:11:37.508
Sir. McEntee.

01:11:37.592 --> 01:11:39.258
Back to your positions.

01:11:39.842 --> 01:11:43.133
- Quinlan.
<i>- They can't break through, Pat.</i>

01:11:43.217 --> 01:11:45.508
The Gends have shored up
with the big guns.

01:11:46.092 --> 01:11:47.883
Don't we have a load of big guns, Sean?

01:11:47.967 --> 01:11:51.133
Don't the United-fucking-Nations
have a load of big guns?

01:11:51.217 --> 01:11:52.633
<i>Not that we can get to you.</i>

01:11:54.675 --> 01:11:55.883
Get ready!

01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:00.050
You're hanging us out to dry.

01:12:00.133 --> 01:12:01.175
Tell me you're not.

01:12:01.883 --> 01:12:05.967
They're splitting
into platoons! Target their heavy guns!

01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:07.342
Open fire!

01:12:07.425 --> 01:12:10.633
Tell me what I'm supposed to do, General.

01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:14.342
<i>General!</i>

01:12:18.633 --> 01:12:20.508
Carry out your orders, Commandant.

01:12:21.467 --> 01:12:22.508
Hold your ground.

01:12:23.508 --> 01:12:24.967
Defend Jadotville.

01:12:26.508 --> 01:12:28.800
With what? A firm tone?

01:12:53.883 --> 01:12:54.925
Ammo!

01:12:55.008 --> 01:12:56.592
We need more ammo over here!

01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:04.425
Make it last!

01:13:05.675 --> 01:13:09.133
I'm going to start charging you
for every fucking bullet that misses!

01:13:13.258 --> 01:13:15.050
Stick to your positions!

01:13:15.133 --> 01:13:16.508
Last magazine!

01:13:20.133 --> 01:13:22.258
Go and find out where our fucking ammo is!

01:13:28.342 --> 01:13:29.967
I have to round up more ammo!

01:13:36.717 --> 01:13:39.758
Fucking... little bastards!

01:13:40.592 --> 01:13:42.008
Get off! Get off!

01:13:51.467 --> 01:13:52.717
Hold fire!

01:14:04.258 --> 01:14:05.300
We didn't do that.

01:14:08.342 --> 01:14:09.217
Incoming!

01:14:38.175 --> 01:14:39.550
Cooley!

01:14:43.175 --> 01:14:44.008
Find his head!

01:14:46.425 --> 01:14:47.258
There he is!

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:49.758
Get him some air.

01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:14.758
We're running out of supplies.

01:15:14.842 --> 01:15:16.883
Some of these lads won't last much longer.

01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:23.092
Any dead?

01:15:23.675 --> 01:15:24.883
Not yet.

01:15:56.675 --> 01:15:57.717
Medic!

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.800
Eyes on the south flank!

01:16:01.258 --> 01:16:02.592
Let's get him inside.

01:16:35.092 --> 01:16:36.467
And we're out of morphine.

01:16:38.217 --> 01:16:39.383
Oh, fuck.

01:16:42.008 --> 01:16:43.467
What's it like, getting shot?

01:16:46.092 --> 01:16:47.383
I wouldn't recommend it.

01:16:55.967 --> 01:16:57.717
Dr O'Brien,

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.675
<i>you have made a very bad thing much worse.</i>

01:17:00.758 --> 01:17:03.633
Sir, I made my decisions
based on conditions in the field.

01:17:04.383 --> 01:17:07.175
<i>Your decisions have led to more bloodshed.</i>

01:17:07.258 --> 01:17:10.383
Sir, Operation Morthor
has still been successful in the main.

01:17:10.467 --> 01:17:13.467
But you allowed a massacre
at the radio station.

01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:14.967
You expect me to defend that?

01:17:16.217 --> 01:17:18.633
What am I to do
if a commander chooses to go in hard?

01:17:18.717 --> 01:17:20.175
You're the man on the ground.

01:17:20.258 --> 01:17:21.717
Not every square inch of it, sir.

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:24.217
General Tshombe
was willing to negotiate before this.

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:25.842
Now he's broken all relations.

01:17:25.925 --> 01:17:29.925
And I am told there is an Irish company
stuck in the middle of nowhere under siege

01:17:30.008 --> 01:17:32.842
<i>as a result
of your Radio Katanga disaster.</i>

01:17:32.925 --> 01:17:37.508
Dag... you more than anyone understand
I couldn't control every circumstance.

01:17:37.592 --> 01:17:39.258
<i>You're attached to it, Conor.</i>

01:17:39.342 --> 01:17:41.092
Best leave you unattached to me.

01:17:41.633 --> 01:17:43.675
<i>It's about protecting the organization.</i>

01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:45.675
Secretary General,

01:17:45.758 --> 01:17:47.925
<i>I believe I made the correct decisions.</i>

01:17:48.008 --> 01:17:49.842
If you disagree, when you're here...

01:17:50.967 --> 01:17:52.633
I'll tender my resignation.

01:17:52.717 --> 01:17:55.008
I'm quite sure you think you're right,
Conor.

01:17:56.425 --> 01:17:58.467
But facts on the ground says different.

01:18:00.425 --> 01:18:02.717
And I will have to accept
that resignation.

01:18:05.717 --> 01:18:07.217
<i>Unidentified aircraft.</i>

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:19.842
Hello?

01:18:25.842 --> 01:18:26.675
Get out.

01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:29.342
- Conor, this is a highly volatile...
- Get out!

01:18:44.217 --> 01:18:46.092
Sir, the crow is incoming.

01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:57.467
Get that gun up!

01:19:10.883 --> 01:19:11.925
Sergeant!

01:19:12.508 --> 01:19:13.758
Help me flip it.

01:19:13.842 --> 01:19:14.883
Corporal Donnelly!

01:19:14.967 --> 01:19:16.133
Bring your sections!

01:19:17.508 --> 01:19:18.758
One, two, three!

01:19:20.883 --> 01:19:22.467
To your stations!

01:19:56.675 --> 01:19:58.258
I need directions immediately.

01:19:58.342 --> 01:20:00.592
<i>Your message
will be conveyed to Dr O'Brien.</i>

01:20:00.675 --> 01:20:02.508
What's he doing that's so important?

01:20:02.592 --> 01:20:05.092
Does he have any other
United Nations units under siege?

01:20:05.175 --> 01:20:07.592
<i>Your message
will be conveyed to Dr O'Brien.</i>

01:20:07.675 --> 01:20:08.717
Fuck!

01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:14.383
- We're gonna have to leave them out there.
- We're not abandoning them.

01:20:14.467 --> 01:20:17.633
If we engage a battle for air-superiority,
it could lead to full-out war.

01:20:17.717 --> 01:20:20.758
Sure you're not trying
to reinforce a failed operation?

01:20:20.842 --> 01:20:23.800
Look, we cannot be held responsible
for the radio station.

01:20:24.717 --> 01:20:28.342
Quinlan's company was a mistake on
a chess board, leaving a pawn vulnerable.

01:20:29.342 --> 01:20:31.550
You don't sacrifice a queen
to save a pawn.

01:20:35.633 --> 01:20:36.675
What?

01:20:38.508 --> 01:20:41.550
"UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld's
plane went down."

01:20:43.092 --> 01:20:44.842
"There are no reports of survivors."

01:20:52.467 --> 01:20:53.508
Oh, my God.

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:56.758
<i>The tragic death</i>

01:20:56.842 --> 01:20:59.258
<i>of the Secretary General
of the United Nations</i>

01:20:59.342 --> 01:21:00.800
<i>on his way to the Congo.</i>

01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:03.842
<i>Everything now teeters in the balance,</i>

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:06.508
<i>which has increased the stakes
for the United States</i>

01:21:06.592 --> 01:21:08.133
<i>and the Soviet Republic.</i>

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:10.342
<i>In Washington,</i>

01:21:10.425 --> 01:21:12.800
<i>President Kennedy voices his tribute.</i>

01:21:13.717 --> 01:21:17.050
<i>Dag Hammarskjöld's cause

01:21:17.133 --> 01:21:20.258
<i>his willingness

<i>in trying to strengthen
the United Nations</i>

01:21:24.467 --> 01:21:27.175
<i>and make it a more effective instrument</i>

01:21:27.258 --> 01:21:32.050
<i>for the aspirations of the hundreds
of millions of people around the globe</i>

01:21:32.133 --> 01:21:33.842
<i>who desire to live out their lives.</i>

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.717
<i>Those efforts of his are well known.</i>

01:21:37.675 --> 01:21:39.883
<i>It is tragic and ironical</i>

01:21:39.967 --> 01:21:42.258
<i>that his death came</i>

01:21:42.342 --> 01:21:44.300
<i>during a mission he was undertaking...</i>

01:21:45.217 --> 01:21:47.342
<i>in order to bring about cease fire</i>

01:21:47.425 --> 01:21:48.758
<i>in Katanga.</i>

01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:52.217
Let's see what everybody does now.

01:21:52.758 --> 01:21:54.258
<i>...recognizing...</i>

01:21:54.342 --> 01:21:55.383
Come on.

01:21:57.092 --> 01:21:58.133
Turn around.

01:22:02.758 --> 01:22:05.008
You'll be all right, Reidy.
We'll see you at home.

01:22:06.008 --> 01:22:08.258
Clear! We need to go now!

01:22:22.758 --> 01:22:24.508
Get out of there! Get out!

01:23:00.883 --> 01:23:02.842
- Get them!
- Don't let it get near us!

01:23:12.967 --> 01:23:14.342
Get them pilots out!

01:23:22.842 --> 01:23:24.133
What the fuck do we do now?

01:23:25.633 --> 01:23:27.217
The mission now is to keep men alive.

01:23:31.883 --> 01:23:33.883
Charlie Alpha Juliet to Control.

01:23:42.967 --> 01:23:44.008
No response.

01:23:44.092 --> 01:23:46.383
Sir, the radio's working,
they're just not answering.

01:23:46.467 --> 01:23:47.383
Try it again.

01:23:51.967 --> 01:23:54.758
I require an immediate decision
on our last request.

01:23:54.842 --> 01:23:57.425
This is Charlie Alpha Juliet

01:23:57.508 --> 01:23:59.175
awaiting further instructions.

01:24:05.342 --> 01:24:07.883
This is Company A, Jadotville calling.

01:24:09.342 --> 01:24:11.800
I require immediate contact
with anybody there.

01:24:17.175 --> 01:24:18.383
They can hear us, boss.

01:24:24.925 --> 01:24:26.925
If they were gonna help,
they would have by now.

01:24:36.758 --> 01:24:38.050
Sir!

01:24:38.133 --> 01:24:39.467
You need to see this!

01:24:40.133 --> 01:24:41.508
You come with me!

01:24:41.592 --> 01:24:43.217
Control your positions, lads!

01:24:57.633 --> 01:24:59.592
If they get close enough, we're fucked.

01:25:12.508 --> 01:25:13.925
Gather up all the shells.

01:25:14.008 --> 01:25:14.842
Now.

01:25:14.925 --> 01:25:16.050
Sniper!

01:25:16.133 --> 01:25:17.300
Vickers on the roof!

01:25:17.383 --> 01:25:18.383
Yes, sir!

01:25:19.092 --> 01:25:20.717
Man your trench until they get close.

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:23.758
Donnelly, take explosives into the chapel
and outer houses.

01:25:23.842 --> 01:25:26.508
- Yes, sir.
- Stack them against south-facing walls.

01:25:26.592 --> 01:25:28.508
Joyce, grab those boxes!

01:25:28.592 --> 01:25:29.425
Yes, sir!

01:25:29.508 --> 01:25:31.342
Grab that box! Grab that box!

01:25:36.633 --> 01:25:38.550
Sniper, cover the north flank.

01:25:39.258 --> 01:25:40.300
Let's go!

01:25:42.008 --> 01:25:44.175
Every shell you find, put it in the box.

01:25:47.092 --> 01:25:48.050
Get ready for it!

01:25:54.008 --> 01:25:55.050
Get ready!

01:25:55.133 --> 01:25:57.842
Stick to the plan and wait for my signal!

01:26:08.342 --> 01:26:09.967
- Joyce, with me.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:14.008 --> 01:26:15.300
Get those mortars out of there.

01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:18.508
Keep moving!

01:26:34.717 --> 01:26:36.092
Get ready for it!

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:54.383
They're almost there!

01:26:56.883 --> 01:26:58.092
Open fire!

01:27:26.008 --> 01:27:29.050
O'Driscoll's trench, fall back!

01:27:31.508 --> 01:27:33.508
Wait for it. Wait for it.

01:27:34.592 --> 01:27:35.842
Fall back!

01:27:54.133 --> 01:27:54.967
Hold.

01:27:57.217 --> 01:27:58.550
Hold. Wait for it.

01:27:59.508 --> 01:28:00.842
Flank's down!

01:28:03.925 --> 01:28:05.133
Now!

01:28:23.133 --> 01:28:24.842
Get back in your trenches!

01:28:25.508 --> 01:28:26.800
Man your trenches!

01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:46.800
Grab the guns!

01:29:09.467 --> 01:29:10.967
They're coming!

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:19.550
They're coming from the east as well!

01:29:33.425 --> 01:29:34.800
Boys on the left flank!

01:29:57.050 --> 01:29:58.633
We need more men over here!

01:29:59.842 --> 01:30:01.842
Williams, with me. You, too, now!

01:30:02.508 --> 01:30:03.550
Yes, sir.

01:30:06.592 --> 01:30:08.050
Man the north flank!

01:30:15.383 --> 01:30:16.550
Fuck!

01:30:36.633 --> 01:30:37.758
This is the spot!

01:30:44.967 --> 01:30:45.883
Fuck it. I'm out.

01:30:47.925 --> 01:30:51.133
Platoon, fall back!

01:30:51.717 --> 01:30:53.300
Fall back!

01:30:53.383 --> 01:30:54.800
Go! Go!

01:30:56.092 --> 01:30:57.050
Incoming!

01:30:58.675 --> 01:30:59.883
Gorman!

01:30:59.967 --> 01:31:01.550
Get the fuck out of that trench!

01:31:24.675 --> 01:31:26.008
Are you all right?

01:31:29.633 --> 01:31:31.217
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:31:34.342 --> 01:31:36.175
Run!

01:31:43.217 --> 01:31:44.592
Fucking run!

01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:54.883
Ammo's out, sir!

01:31:59.508 --> 01:32:00.592
Fuck! I'm dry clicking.

01:32:00.675 --> 01:32:02.092
I'm done, gents!

01:32:13.175 --> 01:32:14.217
Hold!

01:32:50.342 --> 01:32:51.383
Quinlan!

01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:53.717
Let's finish this!

01:33:48.842 --> 01:33:49.883
Are we done now?

01:35:10.633 --> 01:35:12.092
We've used every bullet twice.

01:35:13.717 --> 01:35:14.967
What do we do now?

01:35:26.425 --> 01:35:27.717
I want your honest answer.

01:35:30.717 --> 01:35:32.383
Should we surrender?

01:35:32.467 --> 01:35:33.758
- No.
- No.

01:35:34.925 --> 01:35:35.967
No.

01:35:38.758 --> 01:35:39.800
No, boss.

01:35:42.758 --> 01:35:43.883
- No, boss.
- No way.

01:35:46.467 --> 01:35:47.425
Well said.

01:35:54.508 --> 01:35:56.550
Good job
I'm the one making the decisions.

01:36:00.633 --> 01:36:01.675
It's over.

01:37:09.842 --> 01:37:13.592
<i>As General Tshombe
continued to play games with the UN...</i>

01:37:13.675 --> 01:37:14.842
<i>we sat in jail,</i>

01:37:14.925 --> 01:37:17.425
<i>under sentence of death, and waited.</i>

01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:24.383
<i>Finally, about a month later,</i>

01:37:24.467 --> 01:37:26.300
<i>word came that we were to be sent home.</i>

01:37:27.133 --> 01:37:28.717
Right, come on. Let's go.

01:37:30.008 --> 01:37:31.467
I wanna get out of this tip.

01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:32.592
Come on. Hurry up.

01:37:33.883 --> 01:37:35.008
Come on.

01:37:37.175 --> 01:37:39.758
<i>We were too relieved
to care what deal had been done,</i>

01:37:39.842 --> 01:37:42.633
<i>and traveled back
knowing that we'd held our own ground...</i>

01:37:43.633 --> 01:37:46.133
<i>and done Ireland and the UN proud.</i>

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:09.842
Commandant Quinlan.

01:38:14.258 --> 01:38:15.300
Welcome back.

01:38:17.133 --> 01:38:18.758
It's a poor reception, I know.

01:38:19.717 --> 01:38:21.633
I'm putting them all up for medals.

01:38:21.717 --> 01:38:24.175
For a virgin army... hell, for any army...

01:38:24.258 --> 01:38:25.550
they were magnificent.

01:38:26.842 --> 01:38:28.467
It's not the right time.

01:38:29.675 --> 01:38:30.717
What do you mean?

01:38:32.133 --> 01:38:34.133
There's not going to be
any mention of this.

01:38:36.758 --> 01:38:38.217
It's a complicated situation,

01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:41.092
and frankly,
you've made it more complicated.

01:38:41.175 --> 01:38:42.217
How?

01:38:44.175 --> 01:38:45.383
By surrendering.

01:38:46.175 --> 01:38:47.675
You made us look bad.

01:38:49.050 --> 01:38:51.133
Look, it's not just me, you understand.

01:38:53.258 --> 01:38:55.383
The whole United Nations has been judged.

01:38:56.592 --> 01:38:59.758
If we treat your men like heroes,
then we damage the institution.

01:39:01.175 --> 01:39:03.008
Is this coming from you or O'Brien?

01:39:03.883 --> 01:39:05.550
That's an impertinent question.

01:39:06.342 --> 01:39:07.383
Lads.

01:39:11.467 --> 01:39:12.925
What kind of a soldier are you?

01:39:14.467 --> 01:39:15.883
We can make it a lot worse.

01:39:16.675 --> 01:39:19.008
There's talk of a court martial
for cowardice.

01:39:21.925 --> 01:39:22.967
Do it.

01:39:23.467 --> 01:39:24.508
I don't care.

01:39:25.342 --> 01:39:26.383
Not just for you.

01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:28.383
For them.

01:39:42.258 --> 01:39:44.175
You can have him court-martialed for that.

01:39:45.383 --> 01:39:47.508
No, it would only kick up too much dust.

01:39:49.717 --> 01:39:51.008
Anyway...

01:39:51.092 --> 01:39:52.383
I think he owed me that one.

01:39:54.008 --> 01:39:55.050
I was right to do it.

01:39:58.383 --> 01:40:00.342
If I hadn't,
the world would be at war now.

01:40:01.467 --> 01:40:03.925
Well, he doesn't understand
how the world works.

01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:30.342
Carry on, lads.
