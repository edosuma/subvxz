00:00.001 --> 00:03.135
<i> I've never seen anything</i>
<i> like this virus before.</i>

00:03.137 --> 00:05.771
Thomas' cells contain
the blueprint for a cure.

00:05.773 --> 00:07.773
I need you to help me
sneak him out of the Cordon.

00:07.775 --> 00:09.441
I was wrong!
If Thomas leaves the Cordon,

00:09.443 --> 00:11.010
the virus leaves with him.

00:11.012 --> 00:13.712
Miss Katie!
You need to take him back!

00:13.714 --> 00:14.913
Thomas is a carrier.

00:14.915 --> 00:16.682
You'll be quarantined
here for 48 hours.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.717
Get out of my way.
(gun cocks)

00:18.719 --> 00:22.054
Yeah, I'm inside.
There's a lot riding on this.
Be safe in there.

00:22.056 --> 00:24.990
I've got the only open line
of communication in the Cordon.

00:24.992 --> 00:26.058
How much would that be worth
to you?

00:26.060 --> 00:28.360
I need to get back
to my family.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.595
JANA:
<i> I'm sorry that he left,</i>

00:29.597 --> 00:31.030
<i> but that is what happens</i>
<i> when you sleep</i>

00:31.032 --> 00:33.499
with married men.
They leave, and you knew that.

00:33.501 --> 00:34.500
I think I'm pregnant.

00:34.502 --> 00:35.768
We have a situation.

00:35.770 --> 00:37.736
<i> I'm sending in a unit</i>
<i> to subdue the crowd.</i>

00:37.738 --> 00:40.939
Negative. Under no circumstances
are you to send in troops.

00:40.941 --> 00:42.074
I don't need your permission.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.076
Go! Go! Go! Come on now!

00:44.078 --> 00:46.378
Hey. (grunts)

00:47.715 --> 00:49.248
Help me.
I can't, Tee.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.682
I bumped into someone.
I might be infected.

00:51.819 --> 00:52.885
Mary.

00:52.887 --> 00:54.420
(tires screech)

00:54.422 --> 00:55.154
Mary!

00:56.891 --> 00:58.824
Where's Mary?
We had to leave her.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.793
BRITNEY: She got sick.
What do you mean,
like sick-sick?

01:01.729 --> 01:02.594
Put her down.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.963
Please. Just put her down.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.171
(static crackling)

01:25.119 --> 01:27.219
They're only five minutes late.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.221
(men shouting in distance)

01:29.223 --> 01:31.623
The National Guard
is never late.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.759
(creaking)

01:34.829 --> 01:37.763
What's the latest
on the riot aftermath

01:37.765 --> 01:40.099
and the guardsmen in isolation?
I can't say, ma'am.

01:40.101 --> 01:41.433
You can't say
or you don't know?

01:41.435 --> 01:42.634
I don't know.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.970
Maybe he's too low down
the chain to know much.

01:44.972 --> 01:46.071
Exactly.

01:46.073 --> 01:47.739
Which means either
the situation is so bad

01:47.741 --> 01:49.408
they have all hands on deck
or...

01:49.410 --> 01:52.344
We're no longer important enough
to deserve anyone higher.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.645
A lot can change
in two days.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.314
There was a riot.
We weren't in charge.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.582
We lost control.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.784
So we get it back.
We change the script.

01:58.786 --> 02:02.221
Right after we go home
and take a shower.

02:02.223 --> 02:04.523
I'll meet you at Joint Ops
in an hour.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.560
And, Major,

02:08.562 --> 02:10.095
the press will be all over this.

02:10.097 --> 02:11.830
We need to be a united front.

02:11.832 --> 02:12.831
We are.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.833
(phone chimes)

02:21.142 --> 02:23.408
(beeping)

02:23.410 --> 02:25.177
(door opens)

02:27.181 --> 02:29.214
I'm way better at that.

02:29.216 --> 02:31.116
(chuckles)

02:31.118 --> 02:32.784
These are special circumstances.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.119
Yeah.

02:34.121 --> 02:36.188
The stakes are high.
You're nervous.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.590
It's called being clutch, Katie.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.592
Okay, the true mark of a good
ballplayer is if they're clutch.

02:44.598 --> 02:48.467
You know a lot of ballplayers
in isolation rooms?

02:49.470 --> 02:51.336
Only eight hours left.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.872
I should be sick, Jake.

02:53.874 --> 02:57.376
Holding Mary like that,
I broke every single rule.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.877
You were brave.
(scoffs)

02:58.879 --> 03:00.546
You think the virus cares
about that?

03:00.548 --> 03:02.114
Okay, fine.
You're right.

03:02.116 --> 03:04.283
If Mary had been sick,
you'd be sick.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.084
But she obviously wasn't.

03:06.086 --> 03:07.719
(beeping)
(door opens)

03:07.721 --> 03:09.721
You see?

03:09.723 --> 03:11.256
I told you.

03:11.258 --> 03:13.125
No sneezes?

03:13.127 --> 03:14.860
No sneezes.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.428
Can I go visit Thomas?

03:16.430 --> 03:17.529
Yeah.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.735
(chuckles)

03:23.737 --> 03:25.971
That's rough.

03:25.973 --> 03:28.407
You're not even the most popular
person in isolation.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.541
I'm a mom.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.444
I'm not in it
for the popularity.

03:34.281 --> 03:35.948
JANA:
Positive.

03:35.950 --> 03:38.650
(sighs)

03:38.652 --> 03:39.751
(Tee groaning)

03:45.859 --> 03:47.192
Tee.

03:47.194 --> 03:50.028
(groaning, panting)

03:52.099 --> 03:54.399
I think my water just broke.

03:57.438 --> 04:00.439
(panting)

04:00.441 --> 04:03.508
CANNERTS:<i> I must declare</i>
<i> the virus as highly contagious</i>

04:03.510 --> 04:06.812
<i> and fatal in 100%</i>
<i> of its victims.</i>

04:06.814 --> 04:08.413
LOMMERS:
<i> I recommend we institute</i>

04:08.415 --> 04:10.249
a cordon sanitaire to contain
the spread of the virus.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.284
LEX:
<i> What I need is the truth.</i>

04:12.286 --> 04:13.952
JAKE:<i> We are in the middle</i>
<i> of the damn hot zone. </i>
(screams)

04:13.954 --> 04:16.221
LEX: Jana!
<i> If we let anyone out,</i>
<i> we're risking the lives</i>

04:16.223 --> 04:18.056
<i> of everyone in this city.</i>

04:21.762 --> 04:23.762
(siren wailing in distance)

04:27.434 --> 04:29.134
Hey. Took you long enough.

04:29.136 --> 04:30.936
Did you get my messages?

04:30.938 --> 04:33.272
"Hey, Lex.
Yo, it's good to see you.

04:33.274 --> 04:36.108
You know, I'm really glad that
you didn't die in quarantine."

04:36.110 --> 04:37.776
It's Lommers.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.212
The whole damn thing.
It's Lommers.

04:40.214 --> 04:41.747
The real Patient Zero,
Henry Burns,

04:41.749 --> 04:43.749
the second he got sick,
he made a telephone call.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.484
The number was blocked,
but I happen to know

04:45.486 --> 04:46.918
it went to Nantucket.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.421
Lommers has a house in...

04:49.423 --> 04:50.522
In Nantucket, I know.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.958
You're me two days ago.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.693
She knew the Syrian kid
was innocent, man,

04:54.695 --> 04:56.695
but she got Cannerts
to make him the villain anyway.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.497
And that delivery notice
that I found, the one

04:58.499 --> 05:00.632
that made us think that Cannerts
sent the virus to Burns,

05:00.634 --> 05:02.834
my hacker says
it's got electronic fingerprints

05:02.836 --> 05:03.902
all over it.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.904
Meaning it's fake.
She planted it.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.572
She probably planted
all the evidence I found

05:07.574 --> 05:08.607
at his apartment, too.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.942
And you have proof
that it was her?

05:10.944 --> 05:12.110
I'm working on that part.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.879
That's the part we need.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.147
And the why.

05:15.149 --> 05:17.349
Why go on TV and blame Syria?

05:17.351 --> 05:18.750
Why risk a global war?

05:18.752 --> 05:20.085
It doesn't track, Leo.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.354
I just spent two days
with the woman,

05:22.356 --> 05:24.156
and I really believed...

05:24.158 --> 05:25.724
You were becoming BFFs?

05:27.895 --> 05:29.561
She's playing you.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.430
This is everything
I've got on Burns.

05:31.432 --> 05:34.800
I figure if we dig deep enough,
we'll find something.

05:38.739 --> 05:39.871
Wait, what's that?

05:39.873 --> 05:41.940
Well, if you remember,
I couldn't find

05:41.942 --> 05:43.942
any job history on him,
but one company...

05:43.944 --> 05:45.844
No, I've seen that before.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.379
In one of your videos

05:47.381 --> 05:48.780
on your blog.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.048
Maybe the one
at your friends' apartment

05:50.050 --> 05:51.416
when...
When they were dead.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.189
(beep)

05:58.592 --> 06:00.759
Where?

06:00.761 --> 06:02.227
There.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.628
(trilling)

06:03.630 --> 06:06.231
(typing)

06:09.603 --> 06:12.604
They were onto
the exact same thing.

06:12.606 --> 06:15.574
Which means they could have
exactly what we're looking for.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.075
How could I have missed this?

06:17.077 --> 06:18.744
I've seen it 100 times.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.145
You were focused
on your friends.

06:22.449 --> 06:24.316
But I'm supposed
to meet Lommers soon.

06:24.318 --> 06:25.517
We'll figure this out.

06:25.519 --> 06:26.952
We owe them.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.588
Yeah.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.257
Hey.

06:34.328 --> 06:36.561
Let's make her pay.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.563
We will.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.605
XANDER:
<i>She's been having contractions.</i>

06:46.607 --> 06:48.106
I think
they're getting closer.

06:48.108 --> 06:51.176
Okay. So, Teresa, we need
to get you settled somewhere.

06:51.178 --> 06:54.112
I think Clean Room Three
is probably best.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.647
You mean the place
we got attacked?

06:55.649 --> 06:57.916
Thanks, but I'm good right here.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.118
100 people have walked
over that floor. It is really

07:00.120 --> 07:01.319
not the best place
to give birth.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.088
We're in the middle
of a viral outbreak.

07:04.391 --> 07:05.791
There's no best place
to give birth.

07:05.793 --> 07:06.858
Sooz.

07:06.860 --> 07:07.959
TERESA:
No, she's right.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.494
If I have to do this,

07:09.496 --> 07:10.996
I'm doing it with Xander.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.831
If he's stuck, I'm stuck.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.538
Baby, listen.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.807
I am so sorry
that I'm in here.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.608
But you and I,
we've got a lifetime together.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.843
I promise you.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.912
But right now,

07:26.914 --> 07:28.447
I need you to be safe.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.248
For our daughter.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.917
Okay?

07:31.919 --> 07:33.218
Okay.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.519
Yeah?

07:34.521 --> 07:35.520
All right.

07:35.522 --> 07:36.988
Come on, sweetheart.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.757
All right.

07:38.759 --> 07:39.891
You're touching her?

07:39.893 --> 07:41.793
We're about to deliver a baby.
(groans)

07:41.795 --> 07:43.094
I think not touching

07:43.096 --> 07:44.362
is out the window.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.730
SUZY:
No. No, Jana, this is crazy.

07:45.732 --> 07:46.998
We can't do this here.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.134
None of us have any idea
what we're doing.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.635
Suzy, stop talking.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.571
Kitchen, laundry, now.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.805
All right, Sam,

07:53.807 --> 07:55.740
I need you to help Teresa
into the clean room,

07:55.742 --> 07:57.409
and then come back
and get whatever sheets

07:57.411 --> 07:58.743
and pillows you can find,
or anything

07:58.745 --> 07:59.744
that might resemble
those things.

07:59.746 --> 08:02.280
No problem.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.281
Don't you get sick

08:03.283 --> 08:05.417
while I'm having your baby.

08:05.419 --> 08:07.385
That would really suck.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.355
WOMAN:
You need to let 'em out.

08:10.357 --> 08:11.890
You need to let people
know what's going on.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.992
Same way you did them, same way
you did the people in the back.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.561
You sent my son into that hell

08:16.563 --> 08:18.597
and then you lock him
in a tent?!

08:18.599 --> 08:20.165
OFFICER:
Ma'am, let's move...

08:20.167 --> 08:21.433
WOMAN:
No!

08:21.435 --> 08:22.868
OFFICER: Ma'am, I'm sorry
for the situation.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.169
We'll try to get some
information on your son...

08:24.171 --> 08:25.604
Didn't think you'd make it.

08:25.606 --> 08:28.039
With all these family members
here, it's a madhouse.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.908
They have every right to be mad.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.110
It's been two days.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.713
We should have an update on the
guardsmen's condition by now.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.648
I agree,
but I can't reach

08:36.650 --> 08:37.649
Captain Scott.

08:37.651 --> 08:38.950
No one's cells work by the wall,

08:38.952 --> 08:40.085
and I've got

08:40.087 --> 08:41.219
conflicting reports

08:41.221 --> 08:42.554
from two different doctors.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.723
So what's our play?

08:44.725 --> 08:46.892
Go there ourselves--
see it firsthand.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.060
Give these people
the truth they deserve.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.098
You seem surprised.

08:53.100 --> 08:57.135
I guess I wasn't
expecting transparency.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.270
Some things are more important,

08:58.272 --> 09:00.605
like honoring
the men we've lost.

09:00.607 --> 09:02.440
Chief, I'd like you
to stay here

09:02.442 --> 09:03.608
and wait for my call.

09:03.610 --> 09:04.776
I'll need a sat phone
out there.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.511
Absolutely. Come with me.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.427
(knocks on glass)

09:23.664 --> 09:25.764
Hey. You're not gonna
believe this.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.165
So Lex said

09:27.167 --> 09:28.600
that there are these journalists
inside the Cordon

09:28.602 --> 09:30.068
who might've been
onto a conspiracy.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.202
That means there could be

09:31.204 --> 09:32.203
a whole apartment
full of evidence.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.339
Against Cannerts?

09:34.341 --> 09:35.974
No, against Dr. Lommers.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.477
Lex said she's the mastermind.

09:39.479 --> 09:40.745
Okay, but... Cannerts still lied

09:40.747 --> 09:42.147
about the timeline
of Patient Zero.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.848
Yeah, well, he'll be out soon,
and we can ask him why.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.016
I can ask him.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.484
You can go check
on that apartment.

09:46.486 --> 09:47.786
(laughs)

09:47.788 --> 09:49.187
Uh, I'm not going anywhere.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.422
Okay? Not for another...

09:50.424 --> 09:52.757
seven hours and four minutes.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.793
Are you crazy? I'm fine.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.161
This is what
we've been waiting for.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.395
No, I'm sorry, I've been waiting

09:57.397 --> 09:58.563
for cold beers and a night out.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.132
Though I'd be willing
to compromise

10:01.134 --> 10:02.367
for whiskey and a night in,
if that's what...

10:02.369 --> 10:04.135
Don't do that.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.804
You're not that guy

10:05.806 --> 10:07.138
you were pretending to be
two weeks ago.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.673
This matters and you know it.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.609
<i> You</i> matter.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.111
Then listen to what I'm saying.

10:14.681 --> 10:15.914
You're a clutch player,
Jake Riley.

10:15.916 --> 10:16.915
Go act like it.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.385
(breathing slowly)

10:20.387 --> 10:21.386
(door opens)

10:28.996 --> 10:30.929
Hey, Teresa?

10:30.931 --> 10:32.864
You okay?
Yeah.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.966
I was visualizing.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.369
They taught us in
this birthing class we went to.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.170
I know it probably sounds dumb.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.006
No, it doesn't.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.707
What-what do you see?

10:42.709 --> 10:45.710
Uh, well,
that's kind of the problem.

10:45.712 --> 10:49.114
When I imagined this,
I was in a hospital, you know?

10:49.116 --> 10:50.949
There were doctors and...

10:50.951 --> 10:53.184
a monitor to hear
the baby's heartbeat.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.487
Not to mention drugs.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.889
I'm guessing you guys don't
keep an epidural in the kitchen?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.926
Hey, Teresa,

11:01.928 --> 11:03.228
you know,
all that would be great.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.829
But you know,

11:04.831 --> 11:06.665
women have been giving birth
for thousands of years

11:06.667 --> 11:07.866
without any of it,

11:07.868 --> 11:09.567
so I'm guessing nature
just takes over.

11:09.569 --> 11:11.169
My great-grandmother
gave birth

11:11.171 --> 11:12.604
in a field in Maine

11:12.606 --> 11:14.572
and went right back
to picking blueberries.

11:14.574 --> 11:17.208
See? Who needs an epidural
when you got stories like that?

11:18.111 --> 11:19.377
(sighs)

11:26.753 --> 11:28.753
(coughing)

11:31.725 --> 11:34.392
Patient Alan Rockwell.

11:34.394 --> 11:37.228
Disease progression
from onset of symptoms...

11:37.230 --> 11:39.464
highly accelerated.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.052
Dr. Cannerts.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.221
I see you made it out
of isolation all right.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.956
I did, yes.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.958
Very happy to see
how great you're doing.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.827
How's Thomas?

12:08.829 --> 12:12.030
Remarkably sanguine
about being back here.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.531
I just wish...

12:17.270 --> 12:18.903
It was just wildly unlucky.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.739
The tests I ran to make sure

12:20.741 --> 12:22.073
he wasn't contagious.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.676
The virus happened
to mutate exactly within

12:24.678 --> 12:27.145
the target sequence
of my PCR primers,

12:27.147 --> 12:29.347
which produced
a false negative.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.583
At least now I can isolate
his antibodies and perhaps...

12:31.585 --> 12:32.951
Make a vaccine?

12:32.953 --> 12:35.653
Not exactly.

12:35.655 --> 12:38.189
It's called
passive immunization.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.725
And they've used it for Ebola
and it could really be effective

12:40.727 --> 12:42.026
to help fight the symptoms,

12:42.028 --> 12:43.561
especially now that
it's taking longer...

12:43.563 --> 12:45.430
It's taking longer
for people to get sick.

12:46.600 --> 12:47.832
I pay attention.

12:47.834 --> 12:50.268
Yes.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.469
I've noticed.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.971
How much longer?

12:52.973 --> 12:55.907
Most people
with the Thomas strain,

12:55.909 --> 12:58.643
they haven't shown symptoms
until past 40 hours.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.145
Uh, 42 hours,

13:00.147 --> 13:03.214
41, 45.

13:03.216 --> 13:06.351
So if I've made it through
42 hours that means nothing.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.854
When you said I was doing great,

13:09.856 --> 13:11.222
you were lying.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.724
Again.

13:12.726 --> 13:14.526
(door beeps, opens)

13:17.130 --> 13:18.797
Less than six hours.

Lommers, Jake.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.387
It was Lommers.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.125
I mean, if you'd seen her
this morning--

17:07.127 --> 17:09.127
the way
she worked the press...

17:11.965 --> 17:13.464
Lommers.

17:13.466 --> 17:16.334
So she's got someone
on the inside.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.770
Or she sent someone in.

Who, Meese?

they had an APD sat phone.

Chief.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.372
Wait, what?

She's working with the chief.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.045
(scoffs) What? No.
Yes.

18:01.047 --> 18:02.313
No. That doesn't even...

18:02.315 --> 18:04.782
Yes. He has the keys
to the sat phones.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.951
He's always telling me
to get right with Lommers.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.021
There is no way

18:10.023 --> 18:13.024
that she would
work with anyone like Meese,

18:25.472 --> 18:28.506
No. I'm sure if you were
hooked up to a monitor right now

18:28.508 --> 18:30.708
you would hear her heartbeat
just fine, okay?

18:30.710 --> 18:32.677
Just because we don't have that
doesn't mean it's not happening.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.584
Wasn't Dad weird too?

19:13.586 --> 19:15.253
What do you mean?

19:15.255 --> 19:18.656
Like... didn't he eat two whole
jars of peanut butter one time?

19:18.658 --> 19:21.058
Where did you hear that?

19:21.060 --> 19:24.629
Well, Grandma never
has peanut butter at her house.

19:24.631 --> 19:27.231
So I told her
she should get some.

19:27.233 --> 19:28.766
Then she got mad.

19:28.768 --> 19:32.136
And then she felt bad
and told me the story.

19:32.138 --> 19:34.138
What exactly did she tell you?

19:34.140 --> 19:36.807
She said that Dad was confused,

19:36.809 --> 19:38.843
and didn't know
what he was doing.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.679
I think
that's weird, right?

19:41.681 --> 19:44.348
Like, how could you not notice?

19:44.350 --> 19:45.483
Unless...

19:45.485 --> 19:47.585
Unless what?

19:47.587 --> 19:49.720
Unless you're on drugs.

19:51.424 --> 19:52.757
He was.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.091
Yeah.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.230
And so was I.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.932
For a while.

20:00.934 --> 20:03.201
But I'm guessing
you already know that.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.903
Grandma told me that part.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.572
Look, honey,

20:07.574 --> 20:09.907
that was a mistake

20:09.909 --> 20:11.576
that I made a long,
long time ago,

20:11.578 --> 20:15.846
and I would never,
ever do it again.

20:15.848 --> 20:18.182
I know.

20:18.184 --> 20:21.118
And, anyway, Jake doesn't
like peanut butter.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.454
(chuckles)

20:23.456 --> 20:25.122
You asked him?

20:25.124 --> 20:27.124
He said he's more
of a bratwurst guy.

20:27.126 --> 20:28.559
Lots of mustard.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.361
Sounds about right.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.667
LEO:
When this is all over, I think
I'll move out to the burbs.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.836
More space, less deadly virus.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.072
LEX: That's really interesting,
Leo. Can you focus?

20:41.074 --> 20:42.740
There must be a money trail.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.076
I know Meese-- he wouldn't
do anything for free.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.178
I can't get a warrant
for his accounts,

20:47.180 --> 20:49.513
and I can't go at the chief
without some leverage.

20:49.515 --> 20:51.115
Yeah, I'm working on it.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.084
Here she is now.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.051
Got to go.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.788
♪ ♪

21:02.161 --> 21:04.128
(knocking)

21:07.233 --> 21:09.500
Hi. Sorry to
bother you. Um,

21:09.502 --> 21:11.269
I've actually been interested
in buying this house

21:11.271 --> 21:13.471
for some time, uh,
but now it seems to be...

21:13.473 --> 21:14.739
Out of foreclosure, yes.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.307
Okay, would you mind, uh,

21:16.309 --> 21:18.209
if I asked you about it anyway?

21:18.211 --> 21:19.510
I'm just...

21:19.512 --> 21:20.811
crazy for real estate,

21:20.813 --> 21:23.581
and yours is the nicest house
on the block.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.683
Oh. Sure.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.686
How about this?

21:30.156 --> 21:31.489
Will it work?

21:31.491 --> 21:32.923
I don't know.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.792
I mean, I can't say most doctors
use a party balloon

21:34.794 --> 21:36.193
to magnify sound, but...

21:36.195 --> 21:38.129
Hey, we might as well
find out, huh?
Yeah.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.671
(panting)

21:50.810 --> 21:52.209
(chuckles)

21:52.211 --> 21:53.944
SAM:
You try.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.917
(heart beating)

22:12.932 --> 22:14.932
(pounding on glass)

22:14.934 --> 22:16.567
What was that?

22:16.569 --> 22:18.436
(door opening)

22:18.438 --> 22:19.603
DENNIS:
Hey!

22:19.605 --> 22:21.772
I'm-I'm back.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.574
(pounding)
Suzy?

22:23.576 --> 22:25.476
Hey! Suzy!

22:25.478 --> 22:26.477
Dennis?

22:26.479 --> 22:28.179
Suzy.

22:28.181 --> 22:29.947
Uh...

22:29.949 --> 22:31.916
Hey.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.189
Let-let me in.

22:38.191 --> 22:40.858
Let's-let's-let's...
let's talk. Um...

22:48.668 --> 22:50.668
(distant chatter)

22:56.909 --> 22:58.576
(indistinct chatter)

22:58.578 --> 22:59.677
(gun cocks)

22:59.679 --> 23:01.746
Uh-uh.

23:05.551 --> 23:06.951
It's all right,
it's all right.

23:06.953 --> 23:09.053
Go on.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.621
TREY:
It's the food drop cowboy.

23:10.623 --> 23:12.623
I just want to talk to Meese.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.692
Is your gun gonna play a part
in that conversation?

23:20.833 --> 23:22.299
MAN:
Yeah, sure do.

23:22.301 --> 23:25.336
Meese, you son of a bitch.

23:25.338 --> 23:27.338
I know what you did
in that apartment.

23:27.340 --> 23:29.507
(sighs)

23:29.509 --> 23:31.008
What apartment?

23:31.010 --> 23:32.743
You know, the good news for you
is I'm not here

23:32.745 --> 23:34.445
because you're
a worthless traitor, okay?

23:34.447 --> 23:36.313
I just want the research.
Why?

23:36.315 --> 23:37.982
You know
it won't change anything.

23:37.984 --> 23:40.284
You'll still be
stuck in here.

23:40.286 --> 23:43.254
Might as well have a beer.

23:43.256 --> 23:44.588
You know...

23:48.728 --> 23:50.127
Those are hard to come by.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.796
Yeah, and so's a conscience,
apparently.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.063
You want the research?

23:53.065 --> 23:54.265
Yeah.
Fine.

23:54.267 --> 23:56.133
Go back for the ashes.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.135
I may be a traitor,

23:58.137 --> 24:00.504
but I'm not sloppy.

24:00.506 --> 24:02.640
(laughs)
Yeah, you know the, uh...

24:02.642 --> 24:03.941
(sniffles)

24:03.943 --> 24:06.477
...the girl that ran the store--
she had your phone.

24:08.214 --> 24:09.814
You're sloppier than you think.

24:09.816 --> 24:12.550
You saw Teresa?

24:12.552 --> 24:13.717
Yeah.

24:13.719 --> 24:14.852
I want the phone back.

24:14.854 --> 24:17.321
And where the hell is Montana?

24:17.323 --> 24:19.457
I gave your guy the phone, okay?
He left.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.625
If he didn't make it back...

24:23.663 --> 24:25.663
And Teresa?

24:26.833 --> 24:28.666
I don't know
how she is, actually.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.702
Don't move.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.286
Make sure she stays strong
for the baby.

24:51.457 --> 24:52.857
I got kids, too.

24:54.727 --> 24:56.360
Outside.

24:58.531 --> 24:59.697
(yelling, pounding)

24:59.699 --> 25:01.232
DENNIS:
Come on, let me in!

25:01.234 --> 25:02.666
Come on! Hey!
(pounding continues)

25:02.668 --> 25:04.435
That one's 65 seconds,

25:04.437 --> 25:05.936
which is good.
When contractions

25:05.938 --> 25:07.771
are longer than a minute,
it means you're getting close.

25:07.773 --> 25:08.806
Okay. How do you know that?

25:08.808 --> 25:09.974
Uh, I-I don't.

25:09.976 --> 25:11.408
I watch...
I watch a lot of television.

25:11.410 --> 25:12.710
(pounding continues)

25:12.712 --> 25:15.079
Should we...?
No, we'll be fine. Just...

25:15.081 --> 25:16.881
Just sit there
on the table.

25:16.883 --> 25:19.083
(groans)
You're doing
really great, okay?

25:19.085 --> 25:20.618
Suzy, just let me in.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.052
I-I just...
I just want to talk.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.621
Hey, no! You need to leave!

25:23.623 --> 25:24.622
No! No, I...

25:24.624 --> 25:26.590
Listen, I want to... Suzy?

25:26.592 --> 25:27.892
Please just listen.

25:27.894 --> 25:29.994
I am, Dennis.

25:29.996 --> 25:32.229
I am. You can talk
from there, okay?

25:32.231 --> 25:35.466
I'm gonna die, and I know that.

25:35.468 --> 25:37.635
And it makes you think
about things.

25:37.637 --> 25:39.403
Suzy, we're...

25:39.405 --> 25:41.772
we're gonna have a baby.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.908
So, if-if you...
if you just let me in,

25:43.910 --> 25:46.010
we'll talk.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.745
I-I'll stay in my office.

25:47.747 --> 25:48.746
I don't want to be alone.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.247
I want to be with you

25:50.249 --> 25:51.415
and our baby.

25:55.621 --> 25:58.822
Actually, I took
a pregnancy test this morning,

25:58.824 --> 26:00.824
and it's okay.

26:00.826 --> 26:02.459
I'm not, so,

26:02.461 --> 26:03.961
you're off the hook.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.996
Really?

26:06.999 --> 26:08.432
Really.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.670
You should go.

26:15.608 --> 26:17.141
You have to go.

26:19.879 --> 26:20.978
Now.

26:26.485 --> 26:29.186
Well, I-I guess

26:29.188 --> 26:31.455
this is... this is good-bye
then, huh?

26:49.342 --> 26:51.342
(gasping)

26:55.982 --> 26:57.982
(indistinct chatter)

27:00.152 --> 27:02.152
Yeah.

27:02.154 --> 27:04.722
I'm actually looking
at him right now.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.523
Go on. I'll be right there.

27:06.525 --> 27:07.658
Okay, I will.

27:07.660 --> 27:08.859
Thanks, Leo.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.527
I'm sorry about that, Chief.

27:10.529 --> 27:12.596
My friend was just telling me

27:12.598 --> 27:14.131
how volatile
the housing market is.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.233
One day you have a home
at foreclosure.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.002
The next, you fall
into the Cordon,

27:18.004 --> 27:19.403
and suddenly
your house is safe.

27:19.405 --> 27:20.804
And your wife's
on a shopping spree.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.640
What are you talking about?

27:22.642 --> 27:24.675
I'm talking about the donation
made to Abigail Meese

27:24.677 --> 27:26.076
from the APD
with your signature on it.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.444
That was standard.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.179
Her husband got hurt on the job.

27:29.181 --> 27:32.349
I know, and quite frankly,
it's a pretty paltry standard.

27:32.351 --> 27:33.784
It makes me wonder
how she managed to save

27:33.786 --> 27:35.686
her house with it,
let alone clear 50 grand

27:35.688 --> 27:38.188
of her husband's gambling debts.

27:38.190 --> 27:39.556
That's none of my business.

27:39.558 --> 27:41.358
But Lommers made it
your business.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.128
I can probably
track down the proof.

27:44.130 --> 27:45.963
Or some fat deposit
from a shell corporation?

27:45.965 --> 27:48.365
But first, I need to know why.

27:48.367 --> 27:49.600
Meese, I understand--

27:49.602 --> 27:50.834
he's weak-- but you?

27:52.171 --> 27:54.171
How the hell she get to you?

27:55.174 --> 27:57.141
You know how?

27:57.143 --> 27:58.842
She convinced me.

27:58.844 --> 28:02.312
This is the way
it has to be done.

28:02.314 --> 28:04.314
You send in a cop
to clear out evidence

28:04.316 --> 28:05.783
against a Syrian family,

28:05.785 --> 28:07.685
because the public
doesn't need the details--

28:07.687 --> 28:10.187
especially when it might
incite violence against Muslims

28:10.189 --> 28:11.255
in this country.
Believe me.

28:11.257 --> 28:13.424
It was the right thing to do.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.694
That's what she told you.

28:18.164 --> 28:19.396
What?

28:19.398 --> 28:21.198
The evidence in that apartment

28:21.200 --> 28:22.866
would not have
damned the Syrians.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.435
It would've damned her.

28:24.437 --> 28:25.869
Sayid was not

28:25.871 --> 28:27.671
Patient Zero--
he was just some kid.

28:27.673 --> 28:29.807
The real guy
is someone Lommers knew.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.308
No, no, no, no.
Why would she do that?

28:31.310 --> 28:33.077
We don't know.

28:33.079 --> 28:35.145
But you can help us get closer.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.815
Chief, you can fix this.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.516
But you have
to tell me everything.

28:40.953 --> 28:42.219
(gasping)

28:42.221 --> 28:43.854
I think it's time.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.289
Okay.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.357
Okay, Teresa, does it feel like
you want to start pushing now?

28:47.359 --> 28:48.659
Can I just--? (stammers)

28:48.661 --> 28:50.761
I-I need my mom here for this!

28:50.763 --> 28:53.430
I need my mom, okay?

28:53.432 --> 28:54.798
(groaning)

28:54.800 --> 28:56.700
JANA:
Okay, um...

28:56.702 --> 28:58.502
I-I-I-I need her!

28:58.504 --> 29:00.070
Teresa, your mom--

29:00.072 --> 29:01.538
I need my mom!

29:01.540 --> 29:03.040
She promised me
she'd be here!

29:03.042 --> 29:05.275
I need to steal Jana for a sec.
Sam?

29:05.277 --> 29:07.044
You good?

29:07.046 --> 29:09.046
Okay, I'm gonna be
right back, okay?

29:09.048 --> 29:10.180
Breathe, sweetie.

29:10.182 --> 29:11.582
Sweetie...

29:11.584 --> 29:13.250
(groaning loudly)
Breathe, Teresa.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.219
Hey, slow down for a sec!

29:15.221 --> 29:17.588
You're right.
This was a terrible idea.

29:17.590 --> 29:18.989
Okay.

29:18.991 --> 29:21.525
We're not just pretending.
We're lying to her!

29:21.527 --> 29:23.160
Jana...
And now she's asking
for her mother.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.728
And what am I supposed to say--
"Oh, hey, Teresa, your mother

29:24.730 --> 29:26.029
"walked out of here
with a giant zombie bite

29:26.031 --> 29:27.197
and she's definitely
super dead"?

29:27.199 --> 29:28.298
No, no, I'd temper that--

29:28.300 --> 29:29.566
How am I supposed to help her?

29:29.568 --> 29:31.034
I've never had a mom!

29:31.036 --> 29:33.303
And-and Sam
has got grandmothers

29:33.305 --> 29:34.538
with blueberries,
and I don't even know

29:34.540 --> 29:36.473
where I was born or how or--
Jana?

29:36.475 --> 29:37.608
Stop it, okay?

29:37.610 --> 29:38.842
Listen to me.

29:38.844 --> 29:40.644
Who cares how you were born?

29:40.646 --> 29:42.212
Look at you now.

29:42.214 --> 29:44.181
There's no one I'd rather
have in a crisis and, well,

29:44.183 --> 29:46.183
I should know because that could
be me in eight-months time.

29:46.185 --> 29:49.720
With the pick of anyone in
this world to have next to me?

29:49.722 --> 29:51.688
I pick you.

29:51.690 --> 29:53.190
Every time.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.192
Okay.

29:55.194 --> 29:57.327
(panting)
Teresa?

29:57.329 --> 29:59.596
You got to breathe.
You got to breathe.

29:59.598 --> 30:01.598
Teresa?

30:01.600 --> 30:03.901
Okay.

30:03.903 --> 30:06.670
I need to tell you
something, okay?

30:06.672 --> 30:08.906
Your mom's not coming.

30:08.908 --> 30:10.507
And you know what?

30:10.509 --> 30:12.509
Xander's not gonna be
by your side, either.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.411
But it's okay.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.346
'Cause you're not
doing it for them.

30:16.348 --> 30:18.382
You're doing it for yourself.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.984
(panting)

30:20.986 --> 30:23.687
(mumbling, groaning)

30:23.689 --> 30:25.189
I think you were right before!

30:25.191 --> 30:26.223
(muttering)

30:26.225 --> 30:27.558
It's time to push!

30:27.560 --> 30:29.560
Okay.
Okay, so on three, we push.

30:29.562 --> 30:31.395
Okay? Ready?

30:31.397 --> 30:33.397
BOTH:
One, two, three!

30:33.399 --> 30:34.598
(screams)

30:47.213 --> 30:48.745
You're back.

30:48.747 --> 30:50.547
Katie, I know
you're upset with me,

30:50.549 --> 30:52.082
but you don't know
the whole story.

30:52.084 --> 30:53.150
Try me.

30:53.152 --> 30:56.053
What matters is
that I'm working as hard

30:56.055 --> 30:57.354
as I can to save us.

30:57.356 --> 30:58.989
What I was saying
about Thomas' blood--

30:58.991 --> 31:00.224
Stop.

31:00.226 --> 31:01.458
You're doing it again.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.093
What?
When you want

31:03.095 --> 31:04.761
to get me off track,
you throw science at me.

31:04.763 --> 31:06.930
You did the same thing
every time I asked

31:06.932 --> 31:08.065
about when Sayid died.

31:08.067 --> 31:09.333
You made me feel like I was

31:09.335 --> 31:11.935
an annoying girl
asking stupid questions.

31:11.937 --> 31:14.137
But turns out,
not so stupid.

31:14.139 --> 31:15.539
Because I figured it out.

31:15.541 --> 31:18.041
Katie, I assure you

31:18.043 --> 31:20.577
there is nothing to figure out.

31:20.579 --> 31:21.845
(chuckles)

31:21.847 --> 31:23.380
You're right.

31:23.382 --> 31:26.416
I'm sure that's why you
ripped up a hospital logbook.

31:26.418 --> 31:27.918
That's okay.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.554
We were still able to find out
who Henry Burns was.

31:30.556 --> 31:33.557
Yes.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.125
Well, I have, um...

31:35.127 --> 31:36.793
Like I said,
there's work to be done.

31:36.795 --> 31:38.462
I should...

31:39.698 --> 31:41.665
Hey, Dr. Cannerts?

31:42.735 --> 31:44.067
You're a coward.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.006
(screaming)

31:50.609 --> 31:52.910
Let's just cool you down
a little bit, huh?

31:54.380 --> 31:56.246
She's gonna pass out soon.

31:56.248 --> 31:57.748
What do we do then?

31:57.750 --> 32:00.250
I promised Xander I'd tell
him something, but I...

32:00.252 --> 32:02.019
You can lie.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.120
You can lie.

32:03.122 --> 32:05.022
All right.
Just go.

32:05.024 --> 32:06.790
You're doing great.

32:10.896 --> 32:13.230
No, not again.

32:20.940 --> 32:22.940
(elevator bell dings)

32:22.942 --> 32:24.942
(Teresa screaming)

32:27.146 --> 32:28.445
Hey, is she...?
Yes.

32:28.447 --> 32:29.713
Right now?
Yes!

32:29.715 --> 32:31.048
Just tell me
they train cops to...

32:31.050 --> 32:32.649
Yes, they do.

32:33.686 --> 32:35.152
I might be sick. I don't know.

32:35.154 --> 32:37.454
XANDER: Just please
help her, please.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.456
Last contractions were
at about a minute.
Please!

32:41.961 --> 32:43.927
JAKE:
Hey, Teresa, Teresa.

32:43.929 --> 32:45.262
Hey. Remember me?

32:46.532 --> 32:47.931
It looks like you might
be having a baby,

32:47.933 --> 32:49.266
which is great news,

32:49.268 --> 32:51.101
because I actually know
how to deliver babies, okay?

32:51.103 --> 32:53.136
I've just been waiting
for an opportunity.

32:53.138 --> 32:56.006
It hurts. It hurts.
I know, I know.

32:56.008 --> 32:58.041
Listen, first baby is supposed
to be this hard, all right?

32:58.043 --> 32:59.443
Now, from what
Sam told me,

32:59.445 --> 33:01.178
it sounds like
you are right on track.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.380
Really? It's normal?
Yeah.

33:03.382 --> 33:04.381
Totally normal.

33:04.383 --> 33:06.049
Hey, hey.

33:06.051 --> 33:07.751
I'm gonna check
under the blanket now.

33:07.753 --> 33:08.752
Is that okay?

33:08.754 --> 33:10.187
Yeah?

33:12.558 --> 33:14.391
I can see her.

33:14.393 --> 33:15.592
I can see her.

33:15.594 --> 33:17.227
Is she (indistinct)?
Yeah.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.428
Hey, Suzy, grab
that pillow for me.

33:18.430 --> 33:19.529
We're gonna sit you
up a little, okay?

33:19.531 --> 33:21.198
It's less pressure
on your spine,

33:21.200 --> 33:23.066
a little easier
for the baby to come out.

33:23.068 --> 33:24.668
And I know your legs are tired,

33:24.670 --> 33:26.837
but I need you to put
your knees up for me.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.505
Okay, this is it.
This is it, okay, Teresa?

33:28.507 --> 33:30.841
On your next contraction,
you're gonna push, okay?

33:30.843 --> 33:32.576
(whimpering)

33:33.946 --> 33:35.278
Hey.
Shh!

33:35.280 --> 33:36.446
This is the best part.

33:36.448 --> 33:38.081
...confidence down there
in Atlanta?

33:38.083 --> 33:39.483
Dr. Lommers has more than that.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.486
I've been getting calls
and e-mails

33:42.488 --> 33:45.055
from people really impressed
with what she did this morning.

33:45.057 --> 33:46.390
They like that she was honest,

33:46.392 --> 33:49.226
and, frankly, they like
her hard-line attitude.

33:49.228 --> 33:50.660
They're scared, Bob.

33:50.662 --> 33:51.995
Of course they are, Bob.

33:51.997 --> 33:52.996
She scared them.

33:52.998 --> 33:54.398
I think people are in.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.866
ANCHOR: So would you say
that the protests

33:55.868 --> 33:57.401
have quieted down...

33:57.403 --> 33:58.769
She is good, man.

33:58.771 --> 34:00.871
You have to admit it--
she's very, very good.

34:00.873 --> 34:03.740
It'll be nicer when my story
blows hers out of the water.

34:10.082 --> 34:12.416
You can't print this.

34:12.418 --> 34:14.384
Why not?

34:14.386 --> 34:15.886
We're still
working on it,

34:15.888 --> 34:18.055
and, uh, we don't have
enough evidence to convict.

34:18.057 --> 34:20.390
In court, maybe, but it doesn't
mean we can't get it out there,

34:20.392 --> 34:21.491
convict her in the press.

34:21.493 --> 34:22.893
In-in that press?

34:22.895 --> 34:24.294
Mm-hmm.
Are you kidding me?

34:24.296 --> 34:26.596
I mean, you print this now,
and she'll just spin it.

34:26.598 --> 34:29.266
Lex, this woman has to pay
for what she's done.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.068
Look, you want an exposé,

34:31.070 --> 34:33.770
but that's not gonna help
the people on the inside.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.439
Getting her out
of power will.

34:35.441 --> 34:37.607
Don't you want someone in charge
whose first priority is

34:37.609 --> 34:40.010
protecting these people rather
than covering her own ass?

34:40.012 --> 34:41.378
You're damn right I do,

34:41.380 --> 34:42.846
but if you're gonna shoot
at the king, you can't miss,

34:42.848 --> 34:45.849
and right now, with this
circumstantial evidence,

34:45.851 --> 34:47.484
up against a king like that...

34:47.486 --> 34:48.819
We'd miss.

34:48.821 --> 34:50.754
We'd miss.

34:50.756 --> 34:53.423
All right, what's your plan?

34:53.425 --> 34:55.092
We need to change the script.

34:57.096 --> 34:58.762
It worked for her,
it can work for us,

34:58.764 --> 35:00.430
but I need you to trust me.

35:02.468 --> 35:05.135
I don't.

35:05.137 --> 35:08.038
But I can give you two hours,
then I'm gonna press "send."

35:11.510 --> 35:12.843
(screaming)

35:12.845 --> 35:14.144
Hey, you're almost there.

35:14.146 --> 35:15.412
No, no, no, you're almost there.

35:15.414 --> 35:18.081
Teresa, hey, I just need
one more push from you.

35:18.083 --> 35:20.350
Just one more push.
Just one more.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.686
JANA: So close, Teresa.
TERESA: No, no, I can't.

35:22.688 --> 35:23.987
Yes, you can.

35:23.989 --> 35:25.355
And you're gonna
surprise yourself,

35:25.357 --> 35:28.024
and I promise you
that's gonna feel really good.

35:28.026 --> 35:30.360
Okay, one more push, and you're
gonna meet your baby girl, okay?

35:30.362 --> 35:31.795
Come on.

35:31.797 --> 35:34.131

36:01.560 --> 36:03.059
You did it.

36:22.114 --> 36:23.713
You're late.

We've got a meeting.

36:31.056 --> 36:33.390
This is the meeting.

36:42.401 --> 36:45.402
Do you want
to explain yourself?

36:45.404 --> 36:48.405
I want you to resign.

36:48.407 --> 36:51.408
That's a pretty bold
request, Major.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.276
Would you like to tell me why?

36:53.278 --> 36:55.378
Or should I just

36:55.380 --> 36:56.546
read quietly?

37:10.762 --> 37:12.862
Well, I see that you
and your vlogger buddy

37:12.864 --> 37:15.632
have been rather busy.

37:17.669 --> 37:21.004
(sighs) Not that you've
found any actual evidence,

37:21.006 --> 37:24.808
I'm sure it felt like fun
detective work at the time.

37:24.810 --> 37:27.811
Do you think this is a joke?

37:27.813 --> 37:30.113
That we wouldn't
take this public?

37:30.115 --> 37:32.182
I think you can take
anything you want public.

37:32.184 --> 37:35.485
I'd be happy to go a few rounds
with you on national television.

37:35.487 --> 37:37.354
If you've noticed,
I do quite well there.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.256
Come on, Lex.

37:39.258 --> 37:41.458
I see what you have here.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.827
A phone call to
an unregistered number

37:43.829 --> 37:46.363
on an island
with 50,000 summer residents.

37:46.365 --> 37:47.697

37:47.699 --> 37:50.367
This isn't a courtroom,
this is just you and me,

37:50.369 --> 37:52.869
and I'm asking you why.

37:52.871 --> 37:56.206
And I'm telling you that you're
out of your depth here, Major.

37:56.208 --> 37:58.375
And I think you should
forget this,

37:58.377 --> 38:01.378
in the name
of national security.

38:08.053 --> 38:11.054
I have more than a phone call.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.058
I have the chief.

38:18.397 --> 38:20.730
Maybe I don't know
why you did it,

38:20.732 --> 38:23.400
but I have a respected,
decorated chief of police

38:23.402 --> 38:26.736
who can testify that you ordered
him to destroy evidence

38:26.738 --> 38:30.740
of a colossal conspiracy
you orchestrated.

38:34.446 --> 38:36.780

Yeah, well,
it's all kind of a blur.

41:23.348 --> 41:25.081
Thankfully.

41:25.083 --> 41:26.416
But I bet it would have
been a lot easier

41:26.418 --> 41:28.017
if you had been there.

41:28.019 --> 41:30.687
There's always next time.

41:32.924 --> 41:34.591
(both laugh)

41:36.495 --> 41:38.161
I was thinking
I'd go grab us some dinner.

41:38.163 --> 41:41.831
And then maybe you
and I can sit down...

41:41.833 --> 41:43.833
(coughs)
