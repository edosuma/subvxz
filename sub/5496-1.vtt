Besides, I didn't know we were going
to end up trapped in a broom closet.

13:46.308 --> 13:49.059
Hey, guys?

13:49.061 --> 13:52.029
You might want to come over here
and read this.

13:56.351 --> 13:58.785
"During the 1950s,

13:58.787 --> 14:00.987
"the Sullivan Gang was rumored
to be responsible

14:00.989 --> 14:03.923
"for over 30 bank robberies
in California alone.

14:03.925 --> 14:06.426
"they were finally killed
in a shootout

14:06.428 --> 14:08.412
"right here in Elk Falls
at their hide-out,

14:08.414 --> 14:10.447
"the old Sullivan place.

14:10.449 --> 14:14.084
Cops said it was
a total bloodbath."

14:14.086 --> 14:16.419
Like, body parts everywhere!

14:16.421 --> 14:20.173
It also says the place is supposed
to be haunted by the gang

14:20.175 --> 14:22.342
and their vicious old dog
Salty.

14:22.344 --> 14:25.645
Haunted by a dog?
Let me see that.

14:25.647 --> 14:28.882
"Over the years,
many citizens of Elk Falls

14:28.884 --> 14:31.518
"have reported hearing
strange noises

14:31.520 --> 14:33.186
"coming from the house,

14:33.188 --> 14:35.622
"which to this day
remains abandoned

14:35.624 --> 14:38.791
"due to an ongoing dispute
over ownership

14:38.793 --> 14:40.778
"and the city's inability
to find a buyer

14:40.780 --> 14:45.148
willing to take on
the troubled property."

14:45.150 --> 14:47.951
NICK:
Dude! Look at these guys!

14:47.953 --> 14:50.620
They look like total psychos!

14:50.622 --> 14:54.874
Hey, this one looks
just like you, goggles.

14:54.876 --> 14:56.876
Haunted by a dog?

14:56.878 --> 14:59.996
What a bunch of baloney!
The place is just old.

14:59.998 --> 15:01.497
We're doing this.
End of story.

15:01.499 --> 15:04.417
Yeah, we kind of have to.
We chicken out now,

15:04.419 --> 15:07.087
our lives at Joe Dante
middle school are gonna suck.

15:07.089 --> 15:10.807
- Probably high school too.
- It already sucks.

15:10.809 --> 15:14.611
Yeah, but we're talking about it
going to an entirely new level.

15:14.613 --> 15:16.229
How are we going
to get our parents

15:16.231 --> 15:18.148
to let us stay the night
in that old house?

15:18.150 --> 15:20.266
It's simple.
We tell our parents

15:20.268 --> 15:21.868
that we're staying over
at each other's houses,

15:21.870 --> 15:23.603
and by morning,
we're heroes.

15:23.605 --> 15:25.889
Jake and those other lug nuts
won't be able

15:25.891 --> 15:28.575
- to push us around anymore.
- NICK: I gotta go home.

15:28.577 --> 15:32.012
My mom's making something
that vaguely resembles meatloaf.

15:32.014 --> 15:35.932
If I don't get there soon, my sister
will gives hers to the dog before I can.

15:35.934 --> 15:39.152
Remember, we meet behind the
school tomorrow at 6:00.

15:39.154 --> 15:41.838
Does this mean
no trick-or-treating?

15:41.840 --> 15:44.207
ALEX:
What do you think?

15:44.209 --> 15:45.859
CHARLIE: This will be better.
Trust me.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.460
NICK:
Oh, okay, Charlie.

15:49.882 --> 15:53.450
- See you tomorrow night, Charlie.
- No you won't.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.768
Got your new wrestling coach coming
over tomorrow night, remember?

15:55.770 --> 15:59.338
- Charlie doesn't wrestle.
- I hate wrestling, dad.

15:59.340 --> 16:01.224
Well, that's why
you're going to take lessons.

16:01.226 --> 16:03.026
That doesn't make any sense.

16:03.028 --> 16:05.612
You need to do something
more physical, okay?

16:05.614 --> 16:07.614
You're wasting too much time
at your computers.

16:07.616 --> 16:10.884
What kind of wrestling coach
comes over on Halloween, anyway?

16:10.886 --> 16:13.236
Bye, boys.

16:13.238 --> 16:16.239
But dad, we have
a big geometry test coming up.

16:16.241 --> 16:19.059
We're in a study group together.
I can't let my friends down.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.711
What about
letting your dad down?

16:21.713 --> 16:24.314
Day after tomorrow,
I promise.

16:25.668 --> 16:27.935
I expect to see an "A"
on that test.

16:30.555 --> 16:33.039
Geometry test, huh?

16:33.041 --> 16:34.658
I know what you guys
are doing.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.460
- You don't know anything.
- Really?

16:37.462 --> 16:41.881
Maybe we should have a talk
with mom and dad then.

16:41.883 --> 16:44.801
I'll do your homework
for a week.

16:44.803 --> 16:47.237
You're not getting my bank.

16:47.239 --> 16:49.473
I already looked in there.
There's not enough.

16:49.475 --> 16:53.110
25 bucks, that's the price
for my silence.

16:53.112 --> 16:54.778
I'll kill him for free.

16:56.582 --> 16:58.248
Deal.

16:58.250 --> 17:01.485
Not a word.

17:01.487 --> 17:03.854
And you're doing my homework.

17:22.373 --> 17:24.773
I'm impressed.

17:24.776 --> 17:26.192
Didn't think
you guys would show.

17:26.194 --> 17:28.377
This is a piece of cake.

17:32.184 --> 17:35.435
If you're doing this
for my sister, forget about it.

17:35.437 --> 17:37.554
- You got no shot with her.
- I'm doing this

17:37.556 --> 17:40.741
because I'm tired of you guys
always giving us a hard time.

17:40.743 --> 17:43.159
We do this,
you guys back off.

17:43.161 --> 17:45.094
Deal?

17:46.965 --> 17:50.316
Deal, but I won't
hold my breath.

17:50.318 --> 17:52.068
Ha!
You clowns ready?

17:52.070 --> 17:54.020
Born ready.

17:55.156 --> 17:58.158
Yeah? Well, talk is cheap,
professor.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.310
Smart money says
you won't make it 'til dark.

18:00.312 --> 18:02.546
I bet they don't
even go inside.

18:02.548 --> 18:04.881
- (BOYS LAUGHING)
- Let's just do this.

18:04.883 --> 18:07.433
Are you sure about this,
Charlie? You don't have to.

18:07.435 --> 18:11.154
Sure he is! The dare is you
stay the entire night.

18:11.156 --> 18:13.356
Of course if you decide
to split early,

18:13.358 --> 18:16.376
youtube and the whole rest
of the world will be watching.

18:16.378 --> 18:18.778
You guys will be
on hidden cameras all night.

18:18.780 --> 18:21.097
Uh, bye, boys.

18:27.690 --> 18:28.888
Can we go now, please?

19:00.488 --> 19:02.989
What are you doing? We didn't
even get to the house yet.

19:02.991 --> 19:06.209
My dad! We're supposed to
be studying for a math test

19:06.211 --> 19:08.311
at your house, remember?

19:08.313 --> 19:10.396
Come on, let's go.

19:23.178 --> 19:25.111
(SIGHS)

19:26.281 --> 19:28.982
Are we almost there yet,
Charlie?

19:28.984 --> 19:31.317
Almost.

19:45.534 --> 19:47.850
Hey, did you read the new
"zombie invasion" comic?

19:47.852 --> 19:49.819
Yes, it's awesome!

19:49.821 --> 19:52.021
Dude, it was awesome. I like
"the zombie warrior" better.

19:52.023 --> 19:54.324
Well, yeah,
because that was the first one.

19:54.326 --> 19:56.293
I mean, it's expected.

20:03.301 --> 20:04.834
(GULPS)

20:04.836 --> 20:08.287
(CROWS SQUAWK)

20:13.211 --> 20:16.296
What now?

20:16.298 --> 20:20.167
How are we
getting in this place?

20:31.563 --> 20:34.213
Okay, come on.

20:39.554 --> 20:42.389
There, that's our entrance.

20:42.391 --> 20:44.690
We pry that wood off
and slip inside.

20:48.530 --> 20:50.830
Let's see here.

20:50.832 --> 20:53.867
We're sure we really
want to do this?

20:53.869 --> 20:55.668
Don't chicken out now, Nick.

20:55.670 --> 20:58.137
They could be watching us
on those cameras.

20:58.139 --> 21:00.323
(GRUNTS)

21:00.325 --> 21:02.325
No turning back now.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.685
This is way too easy.

21:12.687 --> 21:14.704
This is going
to be an awesome night.

21:14.706 --> 21:17.373
Meet up at my place in an hour,
make sure everything's ready.

21:17.375 --> 21:19.709
- I got this.
- Tonight,

21:19.711 --> 21:23.779
those dipsticks are going
to get a double dose of ghost.

21:23.781 --> 21:27.750
- Do you guys really have cameras in there?
- Jake's dad works security.

21:27.752 --> 21:30.253
He gave me a few toys. Heighten
the experience a little.

21:30.255 --> 21:32.439
Plus we got to make sure
your friends don't wuss out.

21:32.441 --> 21:35.341
Don't you think
that's kind of mean, Jake?

21:35.343 --> 21:38.361
Absolutely!

Oh, my face.

22:00.902 --> 22:04.403
(MOANING, COUGHING CONTINUES)

22:04.405 --> 22:07.173
Would you get off me, please?

22:07.175 --> 22:08.942
I'm trying!

22:15.750 --> 22:18.484
Man, it's higher
than I thought.

22:18.486 --> 22:21.955
I don't think we could get back out
that way even if we wanted to.

22:21.957 --> 22:23.155
Great!

22:23.157 --> 22:24.691
So we're trapped
in here?

22:24.693 --> 22:26.358
We shouldn't even be here,
Charlie.

22:26.360 --> 22:27.927
This is all your fault.

22:27.929 --> 22:30.329
Yeah, I had my grimm reaper
super-hero costume

22:30.331 --> 22:34.150
all ready to go for tonight.
But no, I'm trapped here

22:34.152 --> 22:36.769
in this stupid old
haunted house with you guys!

22:36.771 --> 22:39.706
Would you guys calm down? You
whine worse than my baby brother.

22:39.708 --> 22:41.273
ALEX:
So you're calling us babies?

22:41.275 --> 22:44.176
Yeah, snot-nosed
little diaper-wearing babies.

22:44.178 --> 22:46.228
Okay, that's it.

22:46.230 --> 22:47.981
I'm done.
Party's over.

22:47.983 --> 22:49.381
Give me a boost, Nick.

22:49.383 --> 22:51.117
No way,
you give me a boost.

22:51.119 --> 22:52.986
Guys, you really
want to leave?

22:52.988 --> 22:55.855
Aren't you tired of those jerks
always getting the best of us?

22:55.857 --> 22:58.825
This is our chance to show
everyone what we're made of.

22:58.827 --> 23:01.293
We go back out that window now,
we can never show our faces

23:01.295 --> 23:03.062
in the school again.

23:03.064 --> 23:05.732
We can do this,
you know we can.

23:05.734 --> 23:09.169
Unless you really think we're the
gutless losers they say we are.

23:09.171 --> 23:10.904
We're not losers.

23:10.906 --> 23:13.006
So prove it.

23:14.475 --> 23:16.910
Come on, guys.

23:18.646 --> 23:21.948
Forget those guys,
right?

23:23.885 --> 23:25.585
I guess.

23:27.522 --> 23:30.172
CHARLIE: Let's take inventory.
Supply check.

23:32.327 --> 23:34.527
I brought the entertainment.

23:34.529 --> 23:38.164
Ipad, video game, dvd,

23:38.166 --> 23:40.833
D.S., and G.P.S.,
just in case.

23:40.835 --> 23:43.720
Oh, and this.

23:43.722 --> 23:45.187
Nice touch.

23:45.189 --> 23:47.190
Thought you'd appreciate
the irony.

23:47.192 --> 23:49.025
I brought the food.

23:49.027 --> 23:52.745
Chips, salsa-not too spicy-
drinks,

23:52.747 --> 23:54.247
chocolate-covered debby cakes,

23:54.249 --> 23:56.349
and my personal favorite,

23:56.351 --> 23:59.586
hungry boy
fried chicken dinners.

23:59.588 --> 24:02.054
These are frozen dinners.

24:02.056 --> 24:03.889
They'll thaw out
by the time we eat them.

24:03.891 --> 24:07.327
All right, so I brought
the batteries, matches,

24:07.329 --> 24:09.796
non-drip candles.

24:09.798 --> 24:11.931
No one will ever know
that we were here.

24:11.933 --> 24:13.666
What about the window?

24:13.668 --> 24:15.918
Cat did it.

24:15.920 --> 24:20.540
Oh, and these-
standard army flashlights.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.775
- They're the real deal.
- NICK: No, thanks.

24:22.777 --> 24:25.077
I have my cactus jack
ranger pocket knife.

24:25.079 --> 24:26.546
It has a light
built into it.

24:26.548 --> 24:28.080
Look.

24:28.082 --> 24:30.617
Did you get that
out of cereal box?

24:30.619 --> 24:33.820
- It's for small, tight spaces.
- Like your brain?

24:33.822 --> 24:36.205
Let's just look around
and find a place

24:36.207 --> 24:37.473
to settle down for the night.

24:37.475 --> 24:39.608
Maybe we should
just stay right here.

24:39.610 --> 24:43.913
In a dusty old basement?
I don't think so.

24:43.915 --> 24:47.267
Let's just go. This place
smells like a dungeon.

just in case.

25:12.660 --> 25:15.028
Just in case what?

25:15.030 --> 25:17.614
In case the bloody, rotting
corpses of the Sullivan Gang

25:17.616 --> 25:19.899
- are still living upstairs.
- That's not funny!

for a formal invitation?

25:34.799 --> 25:37.216
Maybe we should go
back downstairs.

They'll never know.

no more Jake and his meathead
friends bothering us.

27:16.734 --> 27:19.568
I thought you were out of your
gourd for getting us into this.

Yeah, this actually turned out to
be a pretty good idea, Charlie.

be coming back to school anymore.

41:33.757 --> 41:35.891

my $25.

42:27.560 --> 42:30.495
Turn your light on, Charlie.
I can't see a thing in here.

42:30.497 --> 42:32.397
It's out there.
I dropped it.

42:32.399 --> 42:34.132
Nice going, Charlie!

42:34.134 --> 42:35.901
Where's your cactus jack
ranger light?

42:35.903 --> 42:37.468
I left it
in my sleeping bag.

42:37.470 --> 42:39.121
Well, we're not getting out
this way.

42:39.123 --> 42:41.690
- What time is it?
- What does that matter?!

42:41.692 --> 42:44.709
Sunrise is 6:48 A.M.
I looked it up!

42:44.711 --> 42:46.744
I say we stay right here
until it's light.

42:46.746 --> 42:49.297
Then we make a break
for the front door.

42:49.299 --> 42:51.733
Look, if whatever is out there
wanted to hurt us,

42:51.735 --> 42:53.301
it would have done it already.

42:53.303 --> 42:55.170
Maybe it's just trying
to scare us.

42:55.172 --> 42:57.272
It's doing a pretty good job.

43:06.183 --> 43:09.201
D- d-did you just see that?

43:09.203 --> 43:12.237
That sheet just moved.

43:15.225 --> 43:16.991
Maybe it's just the wind
again.

43:16.993 --> 43:19.244
There is no wind
in this room.

43:19.246 --> 43:21.763

- What am I looking at?

43:21.765 --> 43:25.700
I could have sworn
that thing moved.

43:25.702 --> 43:29.437
Look, there's got to be a logical
explanation for all of this.

43:29.439 --> 43:32.574
This house is really old
and it's got creaks and drafts

43:32.576 --> 43:34.276
and all kinds of crazy stuff.

43:34.278 --> 43:37.128

43:54.965 --> 43:57.132
I think he's right.

43:59.436 --> 44:01.153
- Run!
- Which way?

44:01.155 --> 44:02.887
To anywhere but here!

44:02.889 --> 44:04.523

Him and his meathead friends
rigged all this up

44:51.388 --> 44:53.304
so that we'd leave
and they'd win the bet.

44:53.306 --> 44:55.490
I mean, think about it-
slamming doors,

44:55.492 --> 44:58.726

Come on.

44:58.728 --> 45:00.361
Let's see what else
they set up for us.

45:00.363 --> 45:01.697

45:01.699 --> 45:04.465
Maybe we can give them
a little surprise.

I told you
not to touch anything.

45:31.712 --> 45:33.044
I didn't touch anything.

45:33.046 --> 45:34.946
Well, then what happened
to the picture?

45:34.948 --> 45:37.298
- Maybe a ghost got 'em.

We're missing all the action.

- I did. It's not working.

45:55.819 --> 45:57.985
So you knew your brother was sneaking
off to pull this crazy stunt

45:57.987 --> 46:00.671
- and you didn't tell anybody?
- Dad, he begged me.

46:00.673 --> 46:02.407
I don't want to hear
another word from you.

46:02.409 --> 46:05.894

goes for these days?

46:05.896 --> 46:08.112
Mr. Hamilton,
Charlie was really determined.

46:08.114 --> 46:10.882
Charlie and his friends
lied.

46:10.884 --> 46:12.700
What if they got hurt
or they needed help?

46:12.702 --> 46:14.419
I wouldn't even know
where to find them.

46:14.421 --> 46:16.020
Mr. Hamilton.

46:16.022 --> 46:18.155
Didn't you do anything like this
when you were a kid?

46:18.157 --> 46:19.607
My dad was never a kid.

46:19.609 --> 46:22.610
All right,
get in the van, Todd.

46:22.612 --> 46:24.712
I'm not done with you. Come on,
I'll give you a ride home.

46:24.714 --> 46:26.297
And then I'm going
to deal with this nonsense.

46:26.299 --> 46:27.582
Let's go!

ghosts,

46:33.941 --> 46:36.307
all in one neat little pile.

46:36.309 --> 46:38.276
This is Jake's dad's stuff.

46:38.278 --> 46:40.378
That's how they rigged
the entire house.

46:40.380 --> 46:43.948
It's also how they made
all the doors close and stuff.

46:43.950 --> 46:45.316
No ghosts, huh?

the difference.

I know he lied to you, Mr. Hamilton,
but it was for a good reason.

48:19.196 --> 48:22.630
Yeah, to prove to those other
kids he's some kind of tough guy.

48:22.632 --> 48:24.466
That's not Charlie,
Mr. Hamilton.

48:24.468 --> 48:28.135

to himself he wasn't afraid.

being a kid, you know?

all the time.

about that?

that I'll disappoint

I'm a dork

and I won't be popular anymore.

being a kid sometimes.

Hey, danger is my middle name.

on your head as a kid?

Only once.

by accident.

anywhere?

55:49.896 --> 55:54.315
I'm pretty sure this TV was made
before remote controls were invented.

55:54.317 --> 55:57.068
Maybe there was a power surge.

55:57.070 --> 55:59.686
There is no power in this house.
How could there be a power surge?

01:21:04.042 --> 01:21:05.891
Who's this?

01:21:05.893 --> 01:21:08.310
- I don't know.
- Does he have a tag?

01:21:08.312 --> 01:21:11.064
- What's his name?
- I don't see one.

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:13.833
How about "Salty"?

01:21:13.835 --> 01:21:17.003
He sure acts
like he knows you, Charlie.

01:21:17.005 --> 01:21:19.705
He's so cute!

01:21:19.707 --> 01:21:21.925
What a good boy.

01:21:21.927 --> 01:21:24.543
Can we go home now, please?

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:34.487
(WHISTLES)

01:21:34.489 --> 01:21:36.005
Come on, boy.

01:21:36.007 --> 01:21:39.041
(DOG BARKS)

01:21:42.413 --> 01:21:44.380
Thanks for coming back
for me.

01:21:44.382 --> 01:21:47.650
(LAUGHS) Uh, Charlie
sort of made me do it.

01:21:47.652 --> 01:21:51.086
Boy, when that old TV
came on by itself...

01:21:51.088 --> 01:21:52.805
- (LAUGHS)
- ...or that fireball.

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:56.492
Man! That was the ugliest
ghost I've ever seen.

01:21:56.494 --> 01:21:58.561
Dude, that was the only ghost
you've ever seen.

01:21:58.563 --> 01:22:00.263
What are they talking about?

01:22:00.265 --> 01:22:02.648
Just an old ghost story.

01:22:02.650 --> 01:22:05.568
What did he mean when he said,
"thanks for coming back for me"?

01:22:05.570 --> 01:22:06.836
Tell me, Charlie.

01:22:06.838 --> 01:22:08.254
Really.

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:12.191
Did something happen
in that house last night?

01:22:12.193 --> 01:22:13.393
Yeah.

01:22:13.395 --> 01:22:14.961
I learned
who my real friends are.

01:22:20.451 --> 01:22:22.218
And I don't care what Jake

01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:24.353
or any of his friends
or anyone else says.

01:22:24.355 --> 01:22:26.122
I'm Charlie Hamilton

01:22:26.124 --> 01:22:29.092
and I like math
and science and "D&D"

01:22:29.094 --> 01:22:30.793
and old monster movies.

01:22:30.795 --> 01:22:32.929
And I think
that's pretty cool.

01:22:32.931 --> 01:22:34.463
So do I.

01:22:40.254 --> 01:22:44.324
Well, anyway, it must have
been pretty exciting.

01:22:45.877 --> 01:22:47.777
Are you going to keep him?

01:22:47.779 --> 01:22:49.679
Sure.

01:22:49.681 --> 01:22:53.382
Unless someone else
comes to get him.

01:23:10.451 --> 01:23:12.451
(BOYS LAUGHING)

01:23:12.453 --> 01:23:14.002
(DOG BARKING)

01:23:14.004 --> 01:23:16.355
CHARLIE: Good boy, come on!
Come on!
