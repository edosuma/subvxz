00:35.663 --> 00:37.036
If anyone can hear me,

00:37.036 --> 00:38.802
I'm just outside Trujillo.

00:38.804 --> 00:40.303
I'm not sick, but I'm running out of water.

00:40.305 --> 00:41.805
Please. My children need help.

00:41.807 --> 00:45.342
Please! If you can hear
me, please call back.

00:45.344 --> 00:47.210
We're out...

00:49.914 --> 00:52.582
People are starting to ask
about what goes on in here.

00:52.584 --> 00:54.652
And what do you tell them?

00:54.654 --> 00:56.787
That there's still survivors out there,

00:56.789 --> 00:58.856
that most of the news isn't good.

00:58.858 --> 01:01.025
The crew knows that we
cross-check every message

01:01.027 --> 01:02.860
against their files,

01:02.862 --> 01:06.029
that we'd tell them if we heard
anything about their families.

01:06.031 --> 01:08.230
People have no idea what's
going on outside the ship,

01:08.232 --> 01:10.432
other than what the officers tell them,

01:10.434 --> 01:11.934
and that's not much.

01:14.805 --> 01:16.572
Well, Dr. Scott says she's close

01:16.574 --> 01:19.976
to testing a vaccine on the monkeys.

01:19.978 --> 01:22.411
We should set a course for
home. No sense in idling here.

01:22.413 --> 01:23.713
Agreed.

01:26.183 --> 01:28.384
I know I'm not your mother...

01:28.386 --> 01:30.919
But you gotta eat, Mike.

01:30.921 --> 01:33.288
I think I'm becoming a vegetarian.

01:33.290 --> 01:34.556
Did you inform the galley?

01:34.558 --> 01:36.324
I'm hoping to get over it.

01:38.628 --> 01:40.228
So what's on your minds?

01:41.463 --> 01:43.165
We were wondering if
you'd given any thought

01:43.167 --> 01:44.632
as to what we're gonna tell the crew.

01:46.468 --> 01:48.136
About Nicaragua.

01:48.138 --> 01:50.972
It's our opinion, sir, that
they be spared the details.

01:50.974 --> 01:53.875
D.C.A. crew saw blood
all over our uniforms.

01:53.877 --> 01:57.645
We encountered some
hostiles, like at Gitmo.

01:57.647 --> 02:00.415
They don't need to know
about the village, El Toro...

02:00.417 --> 02:02.983
- Our lovely dinner.
- The sick people...

02:02.985 --> 02:05.119
Or how close we were to them,

02:05.121 --> 02:07.088
the fact that we couldn't help.

02:08.757 --> 02:10.890
You don't think they can handle it?

02:13.962 --> 02:16.931
It's our job to carry the weight of this,

02:16.933 --> 02:18.833
not those kids out there.

02:18.835 --> 02:20.801
And we talked to Tex and the lieutenants.

02:20.803 --> 02:22.970
Everyone's on the same page.

02:22.972 --> 02:24.338
And as soon as Mason's well enough,

02:24.340 --> 02:26.140
we'll give him the drill.

02:26.142 --> 02:28.475
It's need to know. It's
how we've always functioned.

02:28.477 --> 02:31.812
Well, some things have changed.

02:31.814 --> 02:34.181
We were all in the dark for
four months up in the Arctic.

02:34.183 --> 02:36.450
People didn't like that much.

02:36.452 --> 02:39.453
They took our word for it that
we were in the dark with them.

02:39.455 --> 02:41.155
We start keeping
information from them now...

02:41.157 --> 02:43.457
I understand, sir, but...

02:44.759 --> 02:47.260
The crew needs hope.

03:13.987 --> 03:16.721
So that's the vaccine?

03:16.723 --> 03:19.724
These are vaccine prototypes.

03:19.726 --> 03:21.493
There are dozens of small gene mutations

03:21.495 --> 03:23.728
between the primordial Arctic,

03:23.730 --> 03:27.365
the Egyptian, and the super virus strains.

03:27.367 --> 03:30.067
The key will be targeting the right one

03:30.069 --> 03:32.637
with the right combinations.

03:32.639 --> 03:35.239
Well, when you inject one
of those prototypes,

03:35.241 --> 03:37.542
how long before we know it if works?

03:37.544 --> 03:39.811
Anywhere from a few hours to a few days.

03:41.581 --> 03:44.182
But one of these could
be the vaccine.

03:44.184 --> 03:46.217
It's just a matter of
finding the right gene?

03:46.219 --> 03:49.620
It's not really that simple, but...

03:49.622 --> 03:51.689
But essentially, yes.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.195
Captain's on the bridge!

04:14.046 --> 04:16.579
Good evening, Nathan James.
This is the captain.

04:16.581 --> 04:18.581
- Shh. Heads up.
- Hang on.

04:18.583 --> 04:21.384
I wanted to inform you all of
our progress in the mission.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.887
As you know, a small team entered Nicaragua

04:23.889 --> 04:26.488
to find primates for Dr. Scott's test,

04:26.490 --> 04:29.325
which she hopes will be a
vaccine against the virus.

04:29.327 --> 04:30.926
While there, we encountered a drug lord

04:30.928 --> 04:33.262
who enslaved 150 people.

04:33.264 --> 04:35.064
We eliminated his men

04:35.066 --> 04:36.732
and we eliminated him,

04:36.734 --> 04:38.300
freeing those healthy people there

04:38.302 --> 04:41.170
to establish a life for themselves.

04:48.444 --> 04:51.413
We also encountered several
dozen infected people,

04:51.415 --> 04:53.815
including children.

04:53.817 --> 04:56.351
Yesterday,

04:56.353 --> 04:58.787
we couldn't help them.

04:58.789 --> 05:02.290
But perhaps tomorrow, we will be able to,

05:02.292 --> 05:04.225
because we came back to the Nathan James

05:04.227 --> 05:06.094
with 34 monkeys.

05:06.096 --> 05:09.563
Dr. Scott will now conduct
her trials on those monkeys.

05:09.565 --> 05:11.131
But we...

05:11.133 --> 05:13.834
We are not waiting.

05:13.836 --> 05:15.436
We're setting a course for home.

05:15.438 --> 05:17.271
By the time we get there,

05:17.273 --> 05:20.441
we believe Dr. Scott will have a vaccine,

05:20.443 --> 05:22.676
and our mission will be completed.

05:22.678 --> 05:26.480
Today's a good day.

05:26.482 --> 05:28.081
Carry on.

05:29.850 --> 05:32.819
Them Kardashian girls
always getting into trouble.

05:32.821 --> 05:34.922
You think they're still fighting for press?

05:34.924 --> 05:37.791
- No doubt.
- No doubt.

05:37.793 --> 05:40.434
Oh, man. I just hate reading
about people breaking up.

05:41.077 --> 05:42.577
I may not look it, but I'm a softie.

05:42.577 --> 05:43.964
I like seeing people getting together.

05:43.966 --> 05:45.665
Yeah, man, I bet ya do.

05:45.667 --> 05:47.301
I got a theory about you.

05:47.303 --> 05:50.203
You keep going on about this
no fraternization business,

05:50.205 --> 05:53.205
and I think maybe you just want
me to keep my grubby hands off

05:53.207 --> 05:54.506
the girl you're sweet on.

05:54.508 --> 05:57.643
You better tell me, amigo.

05:57.645 --> 05:59.878
Don't want our swords crossin' by accident.

06:01.449 --> 06:03.349
I'm just messin' with ya

06:03.351 --> 06:04.550
'cause I already know who he is.

06:04.552 --> 06:06.152
Yeah, keep talking, Tex.

06:06.154 --> 06:08.120
All right, I will.

06:08.122 --> 06:10.156
I'll bet you 10 to 1 that...

06:10.158 --> 06:11.557
She's a lieutenant,

06:11.559 --> 06:14.392
and her initials are...

06:14.394 --> 06:16.227
K.F.C. Without the "C."

06:16.229 --> 06:18.163
Kara.

06:19.532 --> 06:21.366
I swear to God, if you say anything...

06:21.368 --> 06:24.169
Buddy, your secret's
safe with me.

06:25.604 --> 06:27.839
Doesn't matter anyways. It's over.

06:27.841 --> 06:29.841
Didn't look over to me.

06:29.843 --> 06:31.642
Well, it is.

06:33.145 --> 06:35.513
It has to be.

06:37.749 --> 06:39.184
Did you see Mason?

06:40.719 --> 06:43.988
His leg's pretty messed up.

06:43.990 --> 06:46.656
He really didn't want to talk
about what they saw out there.

06:46.658 --> 06:48.925
Master chief looked right
through me on the bridge,

06:48.927 --> 06:51.228
and nobody's seen the X.O. all day.

06:51.230 --> 06:54.931
You really think Dr. Scott's
close to having a vaccine?

06:54.933 --> 06:56.933
I'm not counting my chickens.

06:56.935 --> 06:58.535
So...

06:58.537 --> 07:01.438
The captain's just trying
to buck everyone up?

07:03.408 --> 07:05.109
So we're going home then?

07:05.111 --> 07:06.410
Seem like.

07:06.412 --> 07:08.644
How long will that take?

07:08.646 --> 07:10.413
From here, seven to ten days, probably.

07:10.415 --> 07:12.715
Not sure if we're gonna have to refuel.

07:12.717 --> 07:14.617
And where will that be?

07:14.619 --> 07:16.419
It's above my pay grade, man.

07:16.421 --> 07:19.655
Have any idea what they'll do with me?

07:19.657 --> 07:22.025
Wherever we end up, I'm sure
we'll find a little place

07:22.027 --> 07:23.859
to make a cell for you.

07:23.861 --> 07:25.395
It's the end of days.

07:25.397 --> 07:27.130
You really think the captain
will bother with that?

07:27.132 --> 07:29.297
He ain't gonna let you
roam free. Why should he?

07:29.299 --> 07:32.134
This is madness.

07:32.136 --> 07:35.070
The fate of the world hangs in the balance.

07:35.072 --> 07:36.804
I can be of help to Dr. Scott.

07:36.806 --> 07:38.106
It was me who found the altered gene

07:38.108 --> 07:39.541
when they let me back in the lab.

07:39.543 --> 07:41.076
You tried to kill everyone on the ship.

07:41.078 --> 07:42.411
And I didn't go through with it.

07:42.413 --> 07:43.912
I was scared,

07:43.914 --> 07:48.683
desperate to save my family from Ruskov.

07:48.685 --> 07:52.687
Look, man, I can't help you.

07:52.689 --> 07:55.256
And if I could, I wouldn't.

07:55.258 --> 07:58.426
So let's just stick to chess, okay?

07:58.428 --> 07:59.894
Save your whining for someone else

07:59.896 --> 08:01.328
or take it up with the captain.

08:04.667 --> 08:05.934
Check.

08:21.850 --> 08:23.584
I'm sorry.

08:28.122 --> 08:31.959
I increased the
concentration of her vaccine

08:31.961 --> 08:34.061
and gave her some epinephrine,

08:34.063 --> 08:37.230
though I can't say that
I am altogether hopeful.

08:37.232 --> 08:39.631
But you expected this could happen.

08:39.634 --> 08:41.833
I expected that there
might be some setbacks.

08:41.836 --> 08:44.337
The virus seems to be a little
bit more complicated to target

08:44.339 --> 08:46.038
than I anticipated.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.608
And the added gene might not
be one that I've identified

08:48.610 --> 08:50.110
as of yet.

08:50.112 --> 08:51.711
So you don't really have an answer

08:51.713 --> 08:53.679
for what's going wrong?

08:53.681 --> 08:56.715
I'm still trying to figure out
what the right questions are.

08:56.717 --> 08:58.650
You've gotta be kidding me.

08:58.652 --> 09:01.720
This is all part of the scientific process.

09:01.722 --> 09:03.522
You heard what I told the crew earlier.

09:03.524 --> 09:06.291
I did, and I kinda wish you
hadn't been so optimistic.

09:06.293 --> 09:09.161
- Really?
- I said that I was ready to test.

09:09.163 --> 09:11.396
I did not say that I had the vaccine.

09:11.398 --> 09:14.199
You brought tea. You said you
would've brought champagne.

09:14.201 --> 09:16.368
I am making progress.

09:16.370 --> 09:17.902
It doesn't seem like it.

09:17.904 --> 09:19.370
The biggest breakthroughs
almost always come

09:19.372 --> 09:20.672
after the most enormous setbacks.

09:20.674 --> 09:22.674
You just need to be patient.

09:22.676 --> 09:25.409
And how you gonna
dispose of them?

09:25.411 --> 09:28.145
They're going to need
to be tossed overboard.

09:28.147 --> 09:30.313
I can't leave them there rotting.

09:35.553 --> 09:37.755
Do it at night.

09:37.757 --> 09:39.156
Flight deck.

09:39.158 --> 09:42.092
If anyone asks,

09:42.094 --> 09:45.663
just tell them that's hazardous waste...

09:45.665 --> 09:48.032
Which is what it is.

09:51.872 --> 09:53.997
There's no way they all died.

09:53.997 --> 09:55.698
Six for six.

09:55.700 --> 09:58.568
- She has no idea why.
- Jesus.

09:58.570 --> 10:00.570
I thought you said she had it.

10:00.572 --> 10:03.439
Apparently it's a little
more complicated than that.

10:03.441 --> 10:05.373
She's got 28 more, right?

10:05.375 --> 10:07.076
And if she keeps testing six at a time,

10:07.078 --> 10:09.712
it might not leave her much wiggle room.

10:09.714 --> 10:12.314
I don't wanna burn any more
fuel or time moving towards home

10:12.316 --> 10:15.084
when we may be turning around
and heading back to Nicaragua.

10:15.086 --> 10:17.152
So we're stopping the ship.

10:17.154 --> 10:18.887
Well, the closer we get to home,

10:18.889 --> 10:21.090
the harder it's gonna be on
everyone if we reverse course.

10:21.092 --> 10:22.691
We just told everyone

10:22.693 --> 10:25.727
she's on the verge of having the vaccine.

10:25.729 --> 10:27.229
Now what are we saying?

10:27.231 --> 10:29.797
She's gonna be discreet

10:29.799 --> 10:32.734
with how she disposes of the monkeys.

10:38.708 --> 10:40.609
Well, I'm good with that.

10:40.611 --> 10:43.278
If we go dead in the water without a plan,

10:43.280 --> 10:44.746
people are gonna start
scratching their heads

10:44.748 --> 10:45.462
and chattering.

10:45.462 --> 10:47.915
We just have to stall for a couple days,

10:47.917 --> 10:49.851
just until we know what we're dealing with.

10:49.853 --> 10:51.685
Yes, sir.

10:52.955 --> 10:54.421
Sir.

10:54.423 --> 10:56.624
Any idea why the captain
stopped the ship?

10:56.626 --> 10:58.926
The officers are just trying
to figure out where to go

10:58.928 --> 11:00.261
to make the vaccine.

11:00.263 --> 11:02.196
Really?

11:02.198 --> 11:03.597
Well, they don't wanna waste fuel

11:03.599 --> 11:06.033
going in the wrong direction now.

11:06.035 --> 11:08.569
That's odd,

11:08.571 --> 11:10.905
because the only possible
places which could

11:10.907 --> 11:13.775
accommodate the manufacturing
are in North America.

11:13.777 --> 11:15.242
Well, maybe they're thinking about

11:15.244 --> 11:18.011
going to Brazil or Venezuela.

11:18.013 --> 11:19.980
I'm sure they got labs there.

11:19.982 --> 11:21.447
Brazil and Venezuela were

11:21.449 --> 11:23.483
the hottest zones in this hemisphere.

11:26.154 --> 11:28.255
What does heat have to do with it?

11:28.257 --> 11:30.090
Hot zones, Bacon.

11:30.092 --> 11:31.792
98% death rates.

11:31.794 --> 11:33.894
There is no way anchoring south of here

11:33.896 --> 11:37.330
could even be contemplated,
and Dr. Scott knows it.

11:37.332 --> 11:40.667
I'm sure there's somewhere else.

11:40.669 --> 11:43.036
Puerto Rico has a lab.

11:43.038 --> 11:44.771
But would the captain
wanna go anywhere near there

11:44.773 --> 11:49.141
when Ruskov may still be
somewhere off the Cuban coast?

11:49.143 --> 11:51.911
Something's wrong, Bacon.
Let me assure you.

11:51.913 --> 11:53.445
Wrong how?

11:53.447 --> 11:56.748
Dr. Scott's experiments must be failing.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.751
Well, you said yourself that
they should be using you.

11:59.753 --> 12:02.054
If they were really failing,
don't you think they would be?

12:02.056 --> 12:04.323
Your captain's a stubborn man.

12:04.325 --> 12:06.458
He hates to admit he's
wrong, and as a result,

12:06.460 --> 12:08.393
the wrong people get punished.

12:08.395 --> 12:11.964
He just about tore a hole in
the hull evading the Russians

12:11.966 --> 12:15.166
because he didn't wanna share
the ingredients for the vaccine.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.634
Then he almost got everyone killed

12:16.636 --> 12:18.369
when the water filtration broke.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.139
That crazy stunt with the parachutes...

12:21.141 --> 12:24.709
Nobody's knows what's
happening until it's over.

12:32.384 --> 12:34.785
I speak the truth, Bacon.

12:34.787 --> 12:37.488
Whether or not you want to
hear it is another matter,

12:37.490 --> 12:39.357
but your captain is
hiding something from you.

13:01.346 --> 13:03.347
You're relieved, my man.

13:06.084 --> 13:07.851
Anything?

13:07.853 --> 13:09.686
Not a peep.

13:13.591 --> 13:16.059
Think we're really the only ones left?

13:16.061 --> 13:18.528
Russians are still out there somewhere.

13:31.075 --> 13:32.474
What the hell is she doin'?

13:40.285 --> 13:42.051
She killed six more.

13:42.053 --> 13:43.986
This time, it only took four hours.

13:43.988 --> 13:45.521
How did that happen?

13:45.523 --> 13:47.088
She tried something different.

13:47.090 --> 13:49.157
She's obviously going
in the wrong direction.

13:49.159 --> 13:50.591
Do we need to bring in Quincy?

13:50.593 --> 13:52.327
Maybe she needs another set of hands.

13:52.329 --> 13:55.663
Well, she said "no."

13:55.665 --> 13:57.399
He's not gonna be able to
help much at this point.

13:57.401 --> 13:59.968
- Well, does she have a game plan?
- She's modifying

13:59.970 --> 14:02.304
and experimenting.

14:02.306 --> 14:03.638
That's all she can tell me.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.706
Keep me posted.

14:05.708 --> 14:08.275
I heard blood comes out
of, like, every orifice.

14:08.277 --> 14:10.645
- Dude, come on.
- What?

14:10.647 --> 14:13.414
We saw shit at Gitmo, and it wasn't pretty.

14:13.416 --> 14:14.749
You saw a live one?

14:14.751 --> 14:16.818
No, man, they were dead, but...

14:16.820 --> 14:18.820
Rats were chowing down on their bodies.

14:18.822 --> 14:20.120
It was disgusting.

14:20.122 --> 14:22.222
I hope those C.B.R. suits really work.

14:22.224 --> 14:24.291
Of course they work.

14:24.293 --> 14:26.393
Yeah, but when we were at Gitmo,
we never even put our masks on.

14:26.395 --> 14:28.228
It was just the protocol,
man, to save the oxygen.

14:28.230 --> 14:30.730
And when you got near those
sick people in Nicaragua,

14:30.732 --> 14:32.199
how long did it take to get your masks on?

14:32.201 --> 14:35.402
Jesus! Will you fellas just relax?

14:35.404 --> 14:37.104
Nobody got exposed,

14:37.106 --> 14:38.973
and the lady doc gave us a
test when we got back on board.

14:38.975 --> 14:41.075
Now are we gonna play cards or what?

14:41.077 --> 14:44.345
Seven-card stud. Deuces and
one-eyed jacks are wild.

14:44.347 --> 14:47.165
Wild cards? Where you from, man?

14:47.165 --> 14:49.248
Would've thought you were
more of a purist, Tex.

14:49.250 --> 14:50.683
Ain't nothing about me that's pure.

14:50.685 --> 14:53.019
I thought you'd figure that out by now.

14:53.021 --> 14:54.687
Hey! Look what the cat dragged in.

14:59.126 --> 15:00.493
You all right, sir?

15:00.495 --> 15:02.528
Yeah, I just...

15:02.530 --> 15:05.365
Oh! Whoa! Sir!

15:05.367 --> 15:07.967
- Man, he looks bad.
- Sir!

15:07.969 --> 15:09.469
You all right?

15:09.471 --> 15:11.069
No! Hey, hey, hey! Stay away from him.

15:11.071 --> 15:13.672
Hey, buddy? Buddy? You all right?

15:13.674 --> 15:15.774
I thought you said he got tested.

15:15.776 --> 15:17.710
We got a game going on.

15:17.712 --> 15:20.112
- Get outta here now!
- Talk to me.

15:20.114 --> 15:22.681
All right, look at me. Look at me.

15:28.683 --> 15:31.405
Medical emergency. Medical emergency.

15:31.405 --> 15:34.798
Medical emergency in department 12545L.

15:34.798 --> 15:37.134
Crew lounge. Medical response team provide.

15:38.177 --> 15:39.807
How is he?

15:39.807 --> 15:41.473
Sir, you shouldn't be in
here. You need a suit on.

15:41.475 --> 15:44.977
He's not infected. What happened?

15:44.979 --> 15:47.447
He came in looking for water.
He passed out. He is burning up.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.947
Danny?

15:48.949 --> 15:50.781
- Danny, can you hear me?
- Yeah.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.084
Danny, how long have you
been feeling like this?

15:53.086 --> 15:55.420
Just a few... just...

15:55.422 --> 15:57.814
That's all right. I'm
gonna take care of you.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.125
You're gonna be just fine.
It's just a fever.

16:02.061 --> 16:04.562
Do I have it?

16:04.564 --> 16:06.531
No, you do not have the virus.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.966
- Let's get him up.
- Little help here.

16:13.104 --> 16:18.208
You have to understand, if
this is airborne or blood-borne,

16:18.210 --> 16:20.210
we will all be infected.

16:20.212 --> 16:23.780
The most likely scenario is
that he was bitten by an insect.

16:23.782 --> 16:27.751
In which case, he will not be contagious.

16:27.753 --> 16:31.255
Holy shit, doc. Is it Halloween?

16:31.257 --> 16:33.323
Did you actually walk down
the P-way wearing that?

16:33.325 --> 16:34.449
It's for everyone's safety.

16:34.449 --> 16:35.910
- We should all be wearing them.
- Don't you get it?

16:35.910 --> 16:40.130
If Lieutenant Green has
it, we're all dead anyway.

16:40.132 --> 16:42.899
Everyone just needs to stop panicking.

16:44.835 --> 16:47.470
How long will it take to run a blood panel?

16:47.472 --> 16:50.306
Four to six hours for the first set.

16:50.308 --> 16:52.942
- If nothing pops up, it could take longer.
- Do it.

16:54.311 --> 16:55.978
Something's not right here.

16:55.980 --> 16:57.346
What do you mean?

16:57.348 --> 16:59.482
Me and Cossetti saw her
dumping biohazard bags

16:59.484 --> 17:00.916
off the flight deck.

17:00.918 --> 17:02.285
And where the hell is she
heading with the captain

17:02.287 --> 17:03.952
- in such a rush?
- I don't know.

17:03.954 --> 17:07.356
Yeah. That's what I'm saying.
Nobody knows anything.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.023
This will keep him sedated.

17:09.026 --> 17:11.160
It'll lower his fever and rehydrate him.

17:11.162 --> 17:13.962
I'll be back to replace the
bag in a couple of hours.

17:13.964 --> 17:15.830
I will do it.

17:15.833 --> 17:17.800
You just find out what is
actually wrong with him.

17:25.340 --> 17:27.608
Sir, you need to
lockdown the ship.

17:27.611 --> 17:31.080
No, he does not. I tested
everyone before we boarded.

17:31.082 --> 17:32.681
That was two days ago.

17:32.683 --> 17:34.683
I mean, maybe the virus
hadn't taken hold yet.

17:34.685 --> 17:37.720
It doesn't work like that.
If he'd been exposed,

17:37.722 --> 17:39.787
it would present itself in
his blood within a few hours,

17:39.789 --> 17:41.288
if not a few minutes.

17:41.290 --> 17:43.224
All right, everybody. Let's
put our panties back on

17:43.226 --> 17:45.860
and see how we can help our friend.

17:47.796 --> 17:50.297
You said the virus mutates.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.534
How do you know the strain in Nicaragua

17:53.536 --> 17:55.536
isn't different from the
other ones you've seen?

17:56.839 --> 17:59.040
Even if it was,

17:59.042 --> 18:00.708
its essential core would be the same,

18:00.710 --> 18:04.011
and that is what I test for.

18:04.013 --> 18:05.812
But what if you're wrong?

18:05.814 --> 18:08.181
The mistakes that I made with the vaccine

18:08.183 --> 18:11.218
are an entirely different matter.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.486
That was an experiment.

18:12.488 --> 18:15.656
This test I am certain of 100%.

18:15.658 --> 18:17.258
Sir, every minute we wait

18:17.260 --> 18:18.726
is a minute people are
walking around the ship,

18:18.728 --> 18:20.761
spreading their germs.

18:33.841 --> 18:35.308
This is the X.O.

18:35.310 --> 18:37.943
We're gonna have to take precautions.

18:37.945 --> 18:40.045
Assume the worst until we learn more.

18:40.047 --> 18:42.615
Circle William, set boundaries.

18:42.617 --> 18:44.116
Full C.B.R. gear.

18:44.118 --> 18:45.485
Until Doc Rios gets us more answers,

18:45.487 --> 18:47.052
I don't wanna take any chances.

18:47.054 --> 18:49.088
I can't leave the crew lounge.

18:49.090 --> 18:50.390
You're gonna have to make the call.

18:58.431 --> 19:00.732
Attention, Nathan James. This is the X.O.

19:00.734 --> 19:02.967
All personnel stand fast.

19:02.969 --> 19:04.569
Do not break boundaries.

19:04.571 --> 19:07.539
Set Circle William throughout the ship.

19:10.110 --> 19:11.943
Close all hatches and
secure all ventilation.

19:11.945 --> 19:14.112
D.C.A. and department and
damage control personnel,

19:14.114 --> 19:17.080
pass out C.B.R. gear and filter canisters.

19:17.082 --> 19:19.149
This is the X.O. I say again,

19:19.151 --> 19:21.819
close all hatches and
secure all ventilation.

19:21.821 --> 19:24.722
D.C.A. and department and
damage control personnel,

19:24.724 --> 19:28.225
pass out C.B.R. gear and filter canisters.

19:30.563 --> 19:32.530
What the hell are you doing in here?!

19:32.532 --> 19:34.798
If he has it, I have it.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.266
We had lunch together, sir.

19:50.481 --> 19:53.683
Put this on. Now.

19:59.589 --> 20:02.124
She was throwing biohazard
bags overboard. At night!

20:02.126 --> 20:05.261
If she dumps at night, it's
because she's working at night.

20:05.263 --> 20:06.896
Then why is the lab under armed guard?

20:06.898 --> 20:08.231
How come nobody can know
what's going on in there?

20:08.233 --> 20:09.765
It is a biohazard area.

20:09.767 --> 20:11.200
We know she's testing the
vaccine on the monkeys.

20:11.202 --> 20:13.135
Is it working or not?

20:13.137 --> 20:14.837
Is it working? Look, for all we know,

20:14.839 --> 20:17.172
it's infected monkeys she's
been throwing overboard,

20:17.174 --> 20:18.940
and that's what spreading
the disease everywhere.

20:18.942 --> 20:22.277
Everyone calm down. The disease
is not spreading anywhere!

21:11.659 --> 21:14.395
You said you made some
mistakes with the vaccine.

21:14.397 --> 21:17.230
- Excuse me?
- Before,

21:17.232 --> 21:19.032
when you were arguing with the captain,

21:19.034 --> 21:21.500
you said you made some
mistakes with the vaccine.

21:23.203 --> 21:25.939
We thought it was going
in the right direction.

21:38.719 --> 21:40.085
This is the captain.

21:42.888 --> 21:45.890
Will you alert the X.O., please?

21:45.892 --> 21:47.592
Thank you, doctor.

21:48.761 --> 21:50.429
It's dengue fever,

21:50.431 --> 21:53.398
and it's not contagious.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.867
What does that mean? Is
he gonna be all right?

21:55.869 --> 21:58.337
The only treatment is fluid replacement

21:58.339 --> 21:59.704
and acetaminophen for the fever.

21:59.706 --> 22:01.772
The next 24 hours is crucial.

22:03.108 --> 22:05.609
You gentlemen are dismissed.

22:05.611 --> 22:07.611
Now get some rest.

22:13.485 --> 22:16.820
Dr. Scott, would you
give us a moment, please?

22:20.626 --> 22:22.026
Attention on deck.

22:22.028 --> 22:23.760
All hands, this is the X.O.

22:23.762 --> 22:25.796
The biological threat has been disproved.

22:25.798 --> 22:28.966
There is no biological threat.

22:28.968 --> 22:31.802
Secure from Circle William.
Restart ventilation.

22:31.804 --> 22:33.436
Secure all gear.

22:33.438 --> 22:34.838
I say again, secure from Circle William.

22:34.840 --> 22:36.740
Restart all ventilation.

22:36.742 --> 22:39.442
Secure from MOPP level
4 and restow all gear.

22:39.444 --> 22:43.480
Well...

22:43.482 --> 22:47.683
Now I know why he insisted on
being on that vessel with you.

22:49.119 --> 22:50.452
Yes, sir.

22:50.454 --> 22:52.287
And you were late that night.

22:52.289 --> 22:53.990
Sir?

22:53.992 --> 22:57.326
The timing was off to
impact with the vyreni.

22:58.762 --> 23:00.796
What happened, lieutenant?

23:00.798 --> 23:03.599
He slowed down, sir.

23:03.601 --> 23:05.300
He wanted me to jump too early.

23:05.302 --> 23:07.937
Because he was more concerned
about you than the mission.

23:10.574 --> 23:14.010
We almost ran into the
coral waiting on you.

23:14.012 --> 23:16.077
And now here you are,

23:16.079 --> 23:18.379
possibly infected by the disease.

23:18.381 --> 23:19.880
Running around the ship,

23:19.882 --> 23:21.315
exposing everyone else to get to him.

23:24.252 --> 23:27.020
You took an oath,

23:27.022 --> 23:30.657
and you have a duty to your shipmates.

23:43.705 --> 23:46.440
I'll have the doc come
back and relieve you.

23:46.442 --> 23:49.576
I'm pretty sure you're
anxious to get back to the lab.

23:51.345 --> 23:52.846
Captain.

23:58.552 --> 24:01.521
I know that I kept things
from you in the Arctic,

24:01.523 --> 24:03.323
but I thought that we understood

24:03.325 --> 24:05.391
that we were in this together now.

24:05.393 --> 24:08.561
And I will always be straight with you.

24:08.563 --> 24:11.064
When I don't know, I will say it.

24:11.066 --> 24:12.799
And when I say that I am

24:12.801 --> 24:15.201
- absolutely 100% about something...
- I don't know you.

24:17.571 --> 24:20.607
But I've risked everything for you,

24:20.609 --> 24:22.041
killed for you,

24:22.043 --> 24:24.577
lost men for you,

24:24.579 --> 24:29.015
asked these people to turn
their backs on their families,

24:29.017 --> 24:30.450
for you.

24:30.452 --> 24:33.419
Not for me, captain.

24:33.421 --> 24:34.954
For the human race.

24:34.956 --> 24:37.723
I just happen to be who you're stuck with.

24:37.725 --> 24:40.326
You might wanna figure
out a way how to trust me,

24:40.328 --> 24:41.794
or I have a pretty strong feeling

24:41.796 --> 24:43.496
that this whole thing is gonna fail.

24:57.486 --> 25:00.522
Cossetti saw Dr. Scott
dumping biohazard off the deck.

25:00.524 --> 25:02.324
No, I'm quite sure that was the monkeys.

25:02.326 --> 25:04.158
Her vaccine is failing,

25:04.160 --> 25:06.528
and the captain is covering it up.

25:06.530 --> 25:10.164
So... those monkeys were infected?

25:10.166 --> 25:11.666
Of course.

25:11.668 --> 25:13.134
She's injecting them with the virus

25:13.136 --> 25:15.102
to see if her vaccine is working.

25:15.104 --> 25:16.670
And when it doesn't, they die.

25:18.006 --> 25:20.208
Do you think that's why
captain called for the lockdown?

25:20.210 --> 25:23.044
It sounds to me the captain
feared an outbreak on the ship.

25:23.046 --> 25:24.511
Because of the monkeys?

25:24.513 --> 25:26.147
Or because he doesn't trust her test.

25:26.149 --> 25:28.515
Don't forget a bunch of
them were directly exposed

25:28.517 --> 25:31.018
to the disease in Nicaragua.

25:31.020 --> 25:32.854
But they wore the suits.

25:32.856 --> 25:35.622
So did Frankie Benz, and
he didn't make it back.

25:35.624 --> 25:37.825
Accidents happen.

25:37.827 --> 25:39.260
I imagine you're not the only one

25:39.262 --> 25:41.161
feeling out of sorts about all this.

25:41.163 --> 25:44.498
No. There's a lot of grumbling.

25:44.500 --> 25:46.600
A lot of grumbling.

25:46.602 --> 25:49.803
At the beginning of this epidemic,

25:49.805 --> 25:51.438
your captain told you all

25:51.440 --> 25:55.041
that this ship was the
safest place on earth.

25:55.043 --> 25:57.177
I'm afraid nothing could
be further from the truth.

25:57.179 --> 25:58.645
Your ventilation systems,

25:58.647 --> 26:01.281
everyone living on top of each other...

26:01.283 --> 26:03.116
You think the crud spreads fast?

26:03.118 --> 26:05.285
We're talking about the most
powerful, most contagious virus

26:05.287 --> 26:07.421
ever to strike the planet.

26:07.423 --> 26:10.523
And now you've got teams
going out into infected areas

26:10.525 --> 26:12.658
for supplies every week?

26:12.660 --> 26:14.326
A makeshift lab

26:14.328 --> 26:16.195
that was never meant to
support production of a vaccine,

26:16.197 --> 26:18.163
Dr. Scott playing God down there

26:18.165 --> 26:23.168
with no real idea of what she's doing.

26:23.170 --> 26:25.772
This vessel is a deathtrap.

26:28.208 --> 26:30.910
His temperature's spiking.

26:30.912 --> 26:33.078
When's his next dose?

26:33.080 --> 26:36.215
Not till 7:00.

26:36.217 --> 26:37.716
Can't you up his dosage?

26:39.252 --> 26:41.352
I'm sorry. Any more,
it'll damage his liver.

26:48.561 --> 26:49.928
Just tell her it's prince charming.

26:49.930 --> 26:51.430
She'll know who you're talking about.

26:51.432 --> 26:52.931
Ask her, or I'm gonna start signing.

26:52.933 --> 26:54.399
Hmm? Country? Western?

26:54.401 --> 26:56.668
Oh, just let him in, for Pete's sake.

26:56.670 --> 27:00.371
Aha! All right!

27:02.574 --> 27:05.108
So...

27:05.110 --> 27:08.045
This is your fortress of solitude.

27:08.047 --> 27:10.981
Except for I have no superpowers.

27:10.983 --> 27:12.450
Well, I don't know about that.

27:12.452 --> 27:15.453
I got a feeling about you.

27:15.455 --> 27:16.987
Sounds like the captain did, too, but...

27:18.691 --> 27:20.458
Well, he got a little spooked.

27:20.460 --> 27:23.427
Well, he did what he had to do.

27:23.429 --> 27:25.562
Oh, come on.

27:25.564 --> 27:27.564
Don't tell me that didn't smart.

27:27.566 --> 27:30.133
That lockdown?

27:30.135 --> 27:32.069
Who believes in me
and who doesn't...

27:32.071 --> 27:35.138
Seems like a fairly trite matter

27:35.140 --> 27:37.107
compared to what I have
on my plate right now.

27:37.109 --> 27:38.442
So...

27:42.814 --> 27:45.048
You're gonna figure it out.

27:49.287 --> 27:50.753
Yeah.

28:04.167 --> 28:06.002
Dr. Scott let it slip in the crew lounge

28:06.004 --> 28:08.505
that she was having problems
with her experiments.

28:08.507 --> 28:11.641
Now Burk, Miller, and Cruz are onto it.

28:11.643 --> 28:13.643
People are asking about the monkeys

28:13.645 --> 28:15.712
and why the ship stopped.

28:15.714 --> 28:18.180
They're even questioning
the ham frequency monitoring.

28:18.182 --> 28:19.648
They're isolated.

28:19.650 --> 28:22.151
They have no idea when it's gonna end.

28:22.153 --> 28:24.320
Or how it's gonna end.

28:24.322 --> 28:25.888
Come in.

28:25.890 --> 28:28.157
I apologize, gentlemen...

28:29.993 --> 28:31.427
But we've got a problem.

28:31.429 --> 28:34.330
A couple of the enlisted men came to me.

28:34.332 --> 28:35.898
They were speaking for a larger group...

28:35.900 --> 28:37.833
16 to be exact.

28:37.835 --> 28:39.235
They want off the ship.

28:40.870 --> 28:42.437
Who are they?

28:42.439 --> 28:45.173
You should know that
they were very respectful.

28:53.884 --> 28:57.953
Their enlistments are up... All 16 of them.

28:57.955 --> 28:59.521
And since we didn't uphold them,

28:59.523 --> 29:02.390
technically, they're not
even in the Navy anymore.

29:02.392 --> 29:04.459
I didn't know what to tell them.

29:04.461 --> 29:06.494
Are you suggesting we let them go?

29:06.496 --> 29:08.663
How do you think they'll feel
if we try to stop-loss them?

29:08.665 --> 29:10.998
It'll mean holding them against their will.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.901
I mean, we're not El Toro.

29:13.903 --> 29:16.604
And what kind of message will
that send the rest of the crew?

29:16.606 --> 29:19.107
They can just leave when
things get uncomfortable?

29:19.109 --> 29:22.910
Well, we all knew this
moment might come, didn't we?

29:40.609 --> 29:42.176
So what did the master chief say?

29:42.178 --> 29:43.678
He said he'd bring a
request to the captain.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.713
- You didn't mention me?
- Not yet, no.

29:45.715 --> 29:47.347
You save that for the last possible moment.

29:47.349 --> 29:49.216
I don't see why he would ever let you go.

29:49.218 --> 29:51.385
Because you can't survive
on land without me.

29:51.387 --> 29:53.854
You make that painfully clear,

29:53.856 --> 29:56.490
and at that point, the
captain will have no choice.

29:56.492 --> 29:59.693
It will all blow up in our
faces if he keeps us here.

29:59.695 --> 30:03.197
I can't see how he could
possibly do that.

30:21.082 --> 30:23.317
We know she's dumping monkeys

30:23.319 --> 30:24.751
look, you're the one that told us

30:24.753 --> 30:26.586
she was nowhere close to finding a vaccine.

30:26.588 --> 30:28.021
We took an oath.

30:28.023 --> 30:29.756
To a country that doesn't
even exist anymore.

30:29.758 --> 30:31.758
To each other.

30:33.928 --> 30:35.561
Look, nobody needs us here.

30:35.563 --> 30:38.631
Hey, we leave, that's
16 less mouths to feed.

30:38.633 --> 30:40.065
That's it.

30:40.067 --> 30:41.834
I can't believe you're doing this.

30:41.836 --> 30:44.370
I saw you after lockdown.
You were white as a ghost.

30:44.372 --> 30:45.838
Even Burk was freaked out.

30:45.840 --> 30:47.272
That doesn't mean we're jumping ship.

30:47.274 --> 30:49.208
Your enlistment was up three weeks ago.

30:50.877 --> 30:52.578
Come with us, man.

30:52.580 --> 30:54.447
You don't owe anybody here anything.

30:54.449 --> 30:56.281
Attention, Nathan James.

30:56.283 --> 30:57.850
All hands report to the
flight deck immediately.

30:57.852 --> 31:00.686
All hands report to the flight deck.

31:04.423 --> 31:06.591
Is this about us?

31:06.593 --> 31:08.860
I don't know, man.

31:29.547 --> 31:33.851
I've made some mistakes the past few days

31:33.853 --> 31:36.920
in the ways I've handled information.

31:36.922 --> 31:40.657
I kept you in the dark about our mission

31:40.659 --> 31:44.961
because I'm trying to
protect you from the truth,

31:44.963 --> 31:47.430
which...

31:47.432 --> 31:49.699
Is painful.

31:49.701 --> 31:53.203
That was a poor decision on my part.

31:53.205 --> 31:55.939
I am your captain,

31:55.941 --> 31:57.573
I'm your leader,

31:57.575 --> 32:00.310
and you have every right
to be disappointed in me.

32:00.312 --> 32:04.446
But that doesn't mean that
you should give up hope,

32:04.448 --> 32:07.682
because this mission's not about me,

32:07.684 --> 32:10.452
and it's not about you.

32:12.488 --> 32:14.823
- It's about them.
- Play it.

32:14.825 --> 32:16.525
Roger that, sir.

32:19.529 --> 32:23.065
My name's Henry.
I'm up in Portland, Maine.

32:23.067 --> 32:25.033
We're not sick, but
we're running out of food.

32:25.035 --> 32:27.636
If anyone knows any good
hunting grounds in the area,

32:27.638 --> 32:29.971
we sure could use a tip.

32:29.973 --> 32:32.841
I'm calling out to
anyone in Georgia.

32:32.843 --> 32:36.344
If you're healthy, there's
a safe haven up in Dalton.

32:36.346 --> 32:40.214
There's only 19 of us, and
we're making it day-by-day.

32:40.216 --> 32:42.918
Hello. I am Juan from Oaxaca.

32:42.920 --> 32:45.086
We are very sick here.

32:45.088 --> 32:46.554
Does anyone have the cure?

32:48.691 --> 32:51.292
That is our problem.

32:53.462 --> 32:56.364
In there...

32:56.366 --> 32:57.698
Is the solution.

33:17.487 --> 33:19.520
Come with me.

33:45.312 --> 33:47.913
We've all seen Dr. Rachel Scott,

33:47.915 --> 33:51.416
but most of you have no idea
what it is she's doing here

33:51.418 --> 33:53.084
or even who she is.

33:53.086 --> 33:55.387
She's dedicated her life to research

33:55.389 --> 33:59.758
on treatments and vaccines
for malaria, ebola,

33:59.760 --> 34:02.293
and half a dozen other viruses.

34:02.295 --> 34:05.195
But she wasn't chosen for this.

34:05.197 --> 34:06.797
She fought to be here,

34:06.799 --> 34:10.501
fought the politicians and the bureaucracy,

34:10.503 --> 34:12.937
and convinced them to take a chance on her.

34:12.938 --> 34:16.139
And she was right.

34:16.141 --> 34:19.744
When all the scientists were failing,

34:19.746 --> 34:22.847
she knew what had to be done.

34:22.849 --> 34:27.751
Just so we understand who
we're working with here,

34:27.753 --> 34:30.853
Dr. Scott, can you
explain what's happening?

34:30.856 --> 34:33.989
Thank you, captain.

34:36.494 --> 34:38.295
I, um, understand...

34:38.297 --> 34:40.130
This must all seem
incredibly foreign to you,

34:40.132 --> 34:41.665
so I'll do my best to explain

34:41.667 --> 34:44.101
without completely boring your socks off.

34:44.103 --> 34:46.570
You see, the monkeys have been dying

34:46.572 --> 34:49.972
because... right now,
my vaccine is failing.

34:52.775 --> 34:55.610
I'm sure you've all heard
of the disease yellow fever.

34:55.612 --> 34:58.247
It killed millions of
people all over the world.

34:58.249 --> 35:02.751
In 1937, there was a young
doctor named Max Theiler

35:02.753 --> 35:05.188
who was testing a vaccine on mice.

35:05.190 --> 35:07.656
Theiler and his coworkers attempted the use

35:07.658 --> 35:13.562
of 99 different substrains
of the virus in their vaccine.

35:13.564 --> 35:17.132
But each and every time, the mice died,

35:17.134 --> 35:18.901
until finally,

35:18.903 --> 35:21.403
on the 100th attempt,

35:21.405 --> 35:23.171
they found it.

35:23.173 --> 35:27.242
I don't have the answers today,

35:27.244 --> 35:29.144
and I may not have them tomorrow.

35:29.146 --> 35:31.480
But I can promise you this...

35:31.482 --> 35:37.219
There's absolutely nothing
that will stop me until I do.

35:39.155 --> 35:41.823
It's easy to believe in people

35:41.825 --> 35:43.858
when they're succeeding.

35:46.362 --> 35:48.062
But that's not what we're about.

35:49.599 --> 35:52.066
We have to believe in
each other when we fail.

35:52.068 --> 35:54.368
And if we have to go back to
Nicaragua for more monkeys,

35:54.370 --> 35:55.903
we will.

35:55.905 --> 35:57.605
If we have to go to Puerto Rico, we will.

35:57.607 --> 36:00.942
If we have to go Bangladesh
to find a Bengal tiger,

36:00.944 --> 36:03.210
that is what we will do.

36:03.212 --> 36:05.179
Now what I can promise you

36:05.181 --> 36:06.648
is that whatever we do from here on in,

36:06.650 --> 36:08.582
we will do together.

36:08.584 --> 36:11.418
And the chiefs and officers on this ship

36:11.420 --> 36:13.920
will share with you what
we know... good or bad.

36:17.191 --> 36:19.392
Now...

36:19.394 --> 36:22.863
It has come to my attention

36:22.865 --> 36:24.597
that there's a group of you

36:24.599 --> 36:27.400
who may no longer wanna
continue on with this mission.

36:27.402 --> 36:30.937
Your enlistments are up.

36:30.939 --> 36:32.738
I will not hold you here.

36:32.740 --> 36:34.740
As a matter of fact,

36:34.742 --> 36:37.543
you are owed our gratitude
for your services.

36:39.379 --> 36:42.414
And we have calculated what
you are collectively entitled to

36:42.416 --> 36:44.550
in back pay...

36:44.552 --> 36:49.088
$148,678.

36:49.090 --> 36:53.458
Enough to buy you one used
R.H.I.B. with a full tank,

36:53.460 --> 36:57.296
plus food, water, and medical supplies.

36:57.298 --> 37:01.933
We have determined to set a
course towards home... again.

37:03.503 --> 37:07.439
But for those of you who
still wish to leave us,

37:07.441 --> 37:10.542
report to the fo'c'sle tomorrow at 0700.

37:10.544 --> 37:13.877
Your boat will be waiting.

37:23.454 --> 37:26.423
Hey, Commodore. Cubano?

37:30.161 --> 37:32.229
Our girl was impressive.

37:32.231 --> 37:37.000
Hard thing to come back from...

37:37.002 --> 37:39.236
When you lose somebody's trust.

37:39.238 --> 37:42.172
Well, I'd follow you
into the gates of hell.

37:42.174 --> 37:45.708
That's only 'cause you
think it'd be exciting.

37:45.710 --> 37:47.676
Well, there is that.

37:47.678 --> 37:51.513
It's just 16 guys, you know.

37:51.515 --> 37:52.849
We can do without 'em.

37:52.851 --> 37:55.017
Until the next group wants to leave.

37:55.019 --> 37:56.953
We'll deal with that then.

37:56.955 --> 37:59.188
This is the test.

37:59.190 --> 38:01.758
If they go,

38:01.760 --> 38:04.760
hope goes with 'em.

38:26.239 --> 38:28.374
They're here.

38:57.470 --> 38:59.037
Sir...

39:00.439 --> 39:02.773
We all respectfully request to reenlist.

39:39.677 --> 39:41.978
I swear to support and defend

39:41.980 --> 39:44.513
the constitution of the
United States of America

39:44.515 --> 39:47.115
against all enemies, foreign or domestic,

39:47.117 --> 39:50.653
that I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same.

39:50.655 --> 39:52.220
And that I will obey the orders

39:52.222 --> 39:54.189
of the president of the United States

39:54.191 --> 39:56.992
and the orders of the
officers appointed over me,

39:56.994 --> 39:58.627
according to the regulations

39:58.629 --> 40:00.796
and the uniform code of military justice,

40:00.798 --> 40:03.198
so help me God.

40:10.440 --> 40:13.474
His fever's down. He's on the mend.

40:15.343 --> 40:16.878
Can I have the room?

40:16.880 --> 40:19.881
Aye, sir.

40:27.722 --> 40:30.958
He's one of the best I've served with.

40:32.594 --> 40:34.227
A true leader.

40:34.229 --> 40:35.929
He is.

40:35.931 --> 40:37.798
Doesn't mean I'm not gonna hand him his hat

40:37.800 --> 40:39.700
as soon as he's well enough.

40:39.702 --> 40:41.334
Yes, sir.

40:41.336 --> 40:43.804
What do you think your
punishment should be?

40:43.806 --> 40:46.172
Four weeks,

40:46.174 --> 40:47.873
port and starboard.

40:47.875 --> 40:49.241
Six and six.

40:50.611 --> 40:52.544
I think two weeks oughta do it.

40:52.546 --> 40:56.716
But I'd also like you to devise
and run a new training program

40:56.718 --> 40:59.852
for the J.O's in the
engineering department.

40:59.854 --> 41:03.723
I want them all qualified
on all stations in C.I.C.

41:03.725 --> 41:05.424
Of... of course.

41:05.426 --> 41:07.760
I think it would also be a...

41:07.762 --> 41:10.162
Good idea for you to explain to people

41:10.164 --> 41:12.697
why your behavior was so dangerous.

41:12.699 --> 41:15.800
As a lesson.

41:15.802 --> 41:18.370
I understand, sir.

41:18.372 --> 41:20.005
Good.

41:23.443 --> 41:26.111
Captain?

41:26.113 --> 41:28.113
Thank you.

41:45.698 --> 41:50.368
I hear you and Bacon have been
doing quite a bit of talking.

41:55.174 --> 41:57.074
No more talking.

42:05.931 --> 42:07.988
