WEBVTT

01:38.056 --> 01:39.389
- Get her arms.
- I got this side.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.226
Miss Pulaski?

01:42.393 --> 01:44.812
- Cover her arms.
- Miss Pulaski, calm down now.

01:44.979 --> 01:47.272
It's okay. It's gonna be all right.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.485
- Get her legs.
- I got it. Hang on.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.862
Miss Pulaski,
just calm down, please.

01:54.030 --> 01:55.989
- You're all right.
- Give her a sedative.

01:56.157 --> 01:58.492
No! No!

02:17.303 --> 02:21.056
Ronette pulled out her IV.
I just gave her a sedative.

02:24.352 --> 02:25.686
Looks like dye.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.564
- Harry, give me a hand.
- What's this?

02:28.731 --> 02:31.441
A little chloride.
Spray her finger.

02:31.609 --> 02:33.735
Albert, get your microscope.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.445
All right.

02:36.447 --> 02:39.032
All right, Ronette.
Breathe, now, honey.

02:46.332 --> 02:49.168
- He's been here.
- We have a 24-hour guard.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.961
Harry, he did this.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.504
And he tainted the IV.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.673
Maybe she saw him.

02:55.800 --> 02:59.219
Maybe she heard a Sousa march
and got up to look for her baton.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.847
I'll do a workup on the IV.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.724
That's our man.

03:03.892 --> 03:06.518
Those letters were never made public.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.272
Fellas,

03:10.440 --> 03:12.733
let's stand together for a moment.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.486
It's time I mentioned something.

03:16.946 --> 03:18.947
Now, I'm not sure,

03:19.115 --> 03:22.159
but I believe I was visited by a giant.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.785
Twice.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.287
In my room.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.206
He left me three clues.

03:27.498 --> 03:30.459
The first had to do with
Jacques Renault in a body bag.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.420
It came true almost immediately.

03:33.588 --> 03:37.799
The second was,
"The owls are not what they seem."

03:38.968 --> 03:42.721
The third was about a man
who points without chemicals.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.557
You were visited by a giant?

03:49.270 --> 03:51.146
Any relation to the dwarf?

03:58.404 --> 04:00.697
You're wearing a
different sweater than yesterday.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.824
Color's better on you.

04:03.117 --> 04:04.826
I forgot my manners.

04:04.994 --> 04:06.328
I'm Harold Smith.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.331
I guess you know who I am.

04:09.832 --> 04:12.000
Please come in.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.469
Would you like some lemonade?

04:22.637 --> 04:26.014
I also have some saltines
and some apple butter.

04:26.182 --> 04:27.683
Or would you
like to wash your hands?

04:27.850 --> 04:29.184
No, thanks.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.852
I insist.

04:41.739 --> 04:43.991
It's very warm in here.

04:44.158 --> 04:47.035
- Don't be nervous, Donna.
- I'm not nervous.

04:47.203 --> 04:48.704
I'm curious.

04:48.871 --> 04:52.916
Curious about my relationship
with Laura.

04:53.084 --> 04:55.877
Why did you send me that letter?

04:56.045 --> 04:59.589
Laura wanted me to get in touch with
you if anything ever happened to her.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.091
Why?

05:01.592 --> 05:04.386
She said you'd ask
a lot of questions.

05:05.263 --> 05:06.930
How long did you know Laura?

05:09.100 --> 05:10.934
Ever since she began
Meals on Wheels.

05:11.102 --> 05:14.313
I was her best customer.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.233
You don't seem
much like a shut-in.

05:18.401 --> 05:22.195
You mean, politely,
what's the matter with me?

05:22.363 --> 05:23.405
Okay.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.782
I don't like to go outside.

05:25.950 --> 05:28.160
I, uh...

05:33.166 --> 05:34.708
...can't.

05:35.918 --> 05:38.045
Do you have a judgment
you'd like to express?

05:38.212 --> 05:39.546
No.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.675
Laura said you were very fair-minded.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.887
If you knew her so well, why didn't she
ever mention you to me?

05:47.096 --> 05:50.682
Well, Laura liked to think of me...

05:52.727 --> 05:54.519
...as a mystery in her life.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.480
Then why did you call me?

05:58.608 --> 06:00.650
I am...

06:00.818 --> 06:05.280
Well, I used to be a horticulturist.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.948
I raise orchids.

06:07.116 --> 06:09.284
That's why it's so warm in here.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.578
They don't need a lot of light.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.955
I wrote to you because I wondered

06:14.123 --> 06:16.958
if you'd be kind enough
to place one of them on her grave.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.045
Of course.

06:22.590 --> 06:25.634
- Will you excuse me a moment?
- Sure.

06:56.999 --> 07:00.210
This is a hybrid.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.255
A lady's slipper.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.508
- It's very beautiful.
- Mm.

07:09.512 --> 07:14.433
Take it, please.
My last gift to Laura.

07:15.059 --> 07:17.936
That's very kind of you, Mr. Smith.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.481
Harold.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.861
She was very kind to me.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.907
Forgive me, but I know so much
about you, you see.

07:32.326 --> 07:33.410
What?

07:34.036 --> 07:37.080
You're every bit as lovely
as Laura said you were.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.384
I'll be back.

07:50.511 --> 07:52.345
I'll be here.

08:02.523 --> 08:06.067
R, B, T.

08:06.235 --> 08:08.862
Harry, I believe that these letters
and the Giant's clues

08:09.030 --> 08:11.406
are in some way related
to this long-haired man.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.035
Mrs. Palmer saw him in a vision.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.912
She called this morning
to say that Maddy

08:17.079 --> 08:19.080
had seen the man twice
in the past two days,

08:19.248 --> 08:20.582
both times in a vision.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.293
I've seen him in my dream.

08:23.461 --> 08:24.544
And Ronette.

08:24.712 --> 08:27.464
- Saw him physically at the train car.
- Right.

08:27.632 --> 08:30.634
Four of us have seen him
in different forms.

08:30.801 --> 08:35.347
This path is a psychic link
that will lead us straight to him.

08:36.349 --> 08:40.310
So, what did this giant sound like?
Hmm?

08:40.478 --> 08:43.480
I mean, did he have
a big, booming voice or what?

08:43.648 --> 08:47.734
- No, no. He spoke softly, distinctly.
- And you gave him the beans

08:47.902 --> 08:49.945
you were supposed to use
to buy a cow?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.489
No, Albert, I gave him my ring.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.951
Okay,

08:56.118 --> 08:59.287
confining my conclusions
to the planet Earth,

08:59.455 --> 09:01.498
the cocaine you found
in James Hurley's gas tank

09:01.666 --> 09:03.416
was a match to what we found
in Jacques' car

09:03.584 --> 09:04.960
and Leo's house.
Get the picture?

09:05.127 --> 09:06.169
Even got the frame.

09:06.337 --> 09:07.504
Handiwork of Leo Johnson,

09:07.672 --> 09:11.424
currently appearing at Calhoun
Memorial Hospital as Mr. Potato Head.

09:11.592 --> 09:14.719
The boots are a Circle Brand
rare work boot.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.930
Ones we found haven't been worn
or tampered with.

09:17.098 --> 09:20.350
The letter B from Ronette's finger

09:20.518 --> 09:23.436
was cut from a copy of Flesh World.
It's a perfect match.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.897
This particular edition features
swingers' clubs

09:26.065 --> 09:28.984
for standard poodle enthusiasts.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.569
No comment.

09:31.153 --> 09:33.280
We sent a portrait
of your long-haired man

09:33.447 --> 09:36.366
to every agency from NASA
to DEA and came up empty.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.285
This cat is in nobody's database.

09:38.452 --> 09:41.538
A man that four of us
have seen here in Twin Peaks.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.124
Sure.

09:44.292 --> 09:47.085
Oh, by the way, you were shot
with a Walther PPK.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.046
It's James Bond's gun,
did you know that?

09:51.299 --> 09:53.258
You're looking better today, Coop.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.468
Thank you, Albert. Feeling better.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.679
The trail of the man who shot you
is ice-cold,

09:57.847 --> 10:01.141
but I hoovered some fibers
from the corridor outside your room.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.684
My ticket out of Trolleyville.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.394
I'll be at the lab, gentlemen.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.606
- Anything we should be working on?
- Yeah.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.775
You might practice walking without
dragging your knuckles on the floor.

10:10.943 --> 10:14.029
Albert, let's talk about knuckles.

10:14.196 --> 10:16.239
Now, the last time,
I knocked you down.

10:16.407 --> 10:19.492
I felt bad about it. The next time's
gonna be a real pleasure.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.119
You listen to me.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.996
While I will admit to
a certain cynicism,

10:23.164 --> 10:25.248
the fact is that I'm a naysayer
and hatchet man

10:25.416 --> 10:27.000
in the fight against violence.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.877
I pride myself in taking a punch

10:29.045 --> 10:30.337
and I'll gladly take another

10:30.504 --> 10:34.341
because I choose to live my life
in the company of Gandhi and King.

10:34.508 --> 10:36.885
My concerns are global.

10:37.053 --> 10:42.265
I reject absolutely revenge, aggression
and retaliation.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.143
The foundation of such a method...

10:47.146 --> 10:48.688
...is love.

10:52.109 --> 10:54.319
I love you, Sheriff Truman.

11:01.285 --> 11:05.330
Albert's path is
a strange and difficult one.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.711
Deputy.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.383
James, you're not
gonna be charged.

11:16.550 --> 11:19.177
The cocaine we found in your bike
was planted.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.763
- I was trying to tell you that when...
- James,

11:21.931 --> 11:23.765
I don't wanna see you
down here again.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.141
Yes, sir.

11:25.309 --> 11:27.894
Stop trying to
figure it all out yourself.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.522
Find someone to talk to.
Talk to me.

11:31.148 --> 11:33.316
Go on home, James.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.030
How's it going, Lucy?

11:39.198 --> 11:41.574
Seventy-five words.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.702
Oh, wait a minute, 76.

11:45.621 --> 11:47.831
- Seventy-seven.
- Good work, Lucy.

11:48.624 --> 11:51.835
That's 78.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.964
Agent Cooper asked me to find
as many words as I could

11:56.132 --> 11:59.884
that contain the letters B, T and R.

12:00.052 --> 12:03.763
Let me see.
I used to be pretty good at this.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.902
My lunch date is here.

12:19.196 --> 12:22.073
This is the date that made Andy
call in sick?

12:23.868 --> 12:25.285
Hi, Lucy.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.745
There you are.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.581
Hello, Dick.

12:31.375 --> 12:35.962
Lucy, I've always considered you
to be a woman of letters.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.757
"Prohibited."

12:41.719 --> 12:45.638
I say, I don't believe
we've met.

12:45.806 --> 12:46.931
Richard Tremayne.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.725
Horne's Department Store.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.977
Designer Menswear.

12:52.229 --> 12:53.271
Robot.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.485
Did I do something to anger him?

12:58.652 --> 13:01.946
Not that native people don't have
enough reason to be angry, per se.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.408
- Let's go to lunch.
- Capital.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.035
We'll go Dutch.

13:08.662 --> 13:12.415
So how tall was this guy?
Did his head hit the ceiling?

13:12.583 --> 13:15.376
- Almost.
- Whew.

13:15.544 --> 13:20.048
I believe that the ceilings in The
Great Northern are at least 10 feet tall.

13:20.299 --> 13:21.508
At least.

13:21.675 --> 13:24.844
I'm sorry.
I hope I'm not interrupting.

13:27.389 --> 13:30.642
That's okay, Leland.
What's on your mind?

13:32.394 --> 13:33.895
This man.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.522
I know him.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.234
How do you know him,
Leland?

13:40.069 --> 13:41.653
When I was a little boy,

13:41.821 --> 13:44.531
my grandfather had a summer home
up on Pearl Lakes.

13:44.698 --> 13:46.491
We used to go there every year.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.202
- You knew him from there?
- Yes. Yes.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.955
Now, I know that
he wasn't a Chelbert.

13:52.122 --> 13:54.165
They were our neighbors that lived
on one side.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.001
On the other side
there was a vacant lot.

13:57.711 --> 13:59.629
Next to that was a white house.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.631
That's where he lived.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.342
Do you remember a name?

14:04.510 --> 14:06.010
No.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.347
I think...

14:09.515 --> 14:12.350
I think it was
Robertson. Robertson.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.560
Robertson.

14:13.727 --> 14:17.814
Robert. R, T, B. That's what
the letters are trying to spell.

14:17.982 --> 14:21.192
Hawk, get up to Pearl Lakes, find out
who used to live in that white house.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.444
I'll do what I can.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.113
Leland, thank you.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.825
- That's valuable information. Thanks.
- Thank you, Leland.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.535
Oh... Something else.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.873
He used to flick matches at me.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.713
He'd say:

14:41.881 --> 14:44.757
"You wanna play with fire,
little boy?"

14:56.353 --> 14:57.979
That's our man.

15:09.366 --> 15:12.327
Of course, most of the time I keep
my department running like a top,

15:12.494 --> 15:14.454
but Christmas...
Well, that was such a madhouse.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.331
Was absolutely
no time for paperwork.

15:16.498 --> 15:19.459
I simply had to develop a system
to memorize customer orders

15:19.627 --> 15:21.586
using mnemonic triggers.

15:21.754 --> 15:25.340
For instance,
someone looking for argyle socks?

15:25.507 --> 15:30.178
Well, that would file under A
for "argyle," subheading S for "socks."

15:30.346 --> 15:31.679
Now, it does get tricky.

15:31.847 --> 15:35.516
A request for a vulcanized mackintosh,
for instance...

15:35.684 --> 15:38.645
Now, does that file under R
for "raingear,"

15:38.812 --> 15:40.563
or W for "waterproof"?

15:40.731 --> 15:45.276
My familiarity with the inventory
finds me leaning towards an R.

15:47.529 --> 15:48.905
Lucy, may I ask you something?

15:49.990 --> 15:53.076
Do you find it odd that
I don't switch my fork when I eat,

15:53.243 --> 15:56.120
that I lift it to my mouth
with my left hand?

15:57.414 --> 15:59.666
My mother calls it piling.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.252
Actually, it's not odd at all.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.797
It's the European way.

16:07.132 --> 16:11.302
It's been six weeks, Dick.
You said you were gonna call.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.388
I know.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.557
I lost your phone number.

16:17.017 --> 16:20.603
I work for the sheriff.
You could've dialed 911.

16:21.480 --> 16:25.024
Lucy, I do apologize.
I've been so terribly busy, honestly.

16:25.192 --> 16:27.610
I've hardly had time to feed my cat.
Ha-ha-ha.

16:28.696 --> 16:32.323
We went out every Thursday night
for three months.

16:32.491 --> 16:35.702
You made promises to me. You said
you were gonna take me to dinner

16:35.869 --> 16:38.913
at the Space Needle in Seattle.

16:39.081 --> 16:43.251
Even though you took me to
Family Night at the Pancake Plantation,

16:43.419 --> 16:46.879
I still couldn't help but think
that it meant something special.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.134
When in fact the only thing special
we did that night

16:51.301 --> 16:52.927
was drink two bottles of champagne

16:53.095 --> 16:56.097
and end up on a display bed
in Horne's Home Furnishings!

17:02.688 --> 17:06.983
I admit it was daring.
That made it exciting.

17:07.151 --> 17:10.361
Still, I thought it would lead to more.
Like a phone call.

17:10.529 --> 17:13.740
Lucy, I feel terrible you're upset.
Really I do.

17:13.991 --> 17:17.160
- Let me make it up to you.
- Like how, for instance?

17:17.619 --> 17:19.245
For starters,

17:19.413 --> 17:22.540
I know I promised you a new dress
at my 20 percent employee discount.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.792
After lunch, I'll go right back

17:24.960 --> 17:29.047
and arrange something with Ms. Bolbo
in women's wear. Very special indeed.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.008
Oh, yeah?

17:32.176 --> 17:34.510
How about a maternity dress!

17:36.221 --> 17:37.346
Pardon?

17:38.057 --> 17:40.516
I'm pregnant, Richard.

17:41.393 --> 17:42.685
Pregnant.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.273
Preggers? Hmm.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.861
Does Donna seem different to you?

17:52.029 --> 17:53.529
What do you mean?

17:53.697 --> 17:56.532
Well, like, doesn't her smoking
and stuff bother you?

17:56.700 --> 18:00.369
She's trying to act, like, all tough
all of a sudden.

18:00.537 --> 18:04.415
James, you know her
better than I do.

18:04.583 --> 18:05.666
Yeah.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.795
She came to visit
when I was in jail and...

18:09.213 --> 18:11.089
I don't know.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.424
What?

18:14.134 --> 18:15.301
Well,

18:15.469 --> 18:18.638
she acted like she wanted

18:18.806 --> 18:21.516
to do it with me
through the bars.

18:21.683 --> 18:24.644
She didn't even care
if anybody was around.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.146
I don't know.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.856
It was weird.

18:29.024 --> 18:31.484
It wasn't like her.

18:31.652 --> 18:32.819
I don't know.

18:32.986 --> 18:35.363
I don't know anything anymore.

18:36.240 --> 18:40.660
Sometimes I think I should
just get on my bike and go.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.747
James.

18:45.874 --> 18:48.918
Running away
won't solve anything.

19:02.891 --> 19:05.059
It's gonna be okay.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.232
Donna, where you been?
You're late.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.610
I met someone
from Meals on Wheels.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.738
Those old folks must have
some pretty cool stories.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.282
This was a young man.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.492
Really?
What's wrong with him?

19:22.452 --> 19:24.996
You know, it's hard to say.

19:25.164 --> 19:29.667
Other than he was bright
and charming, intelligent.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.587
Completely unlike anybody I know.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.505
What's that supposed to mean?

19:34.673 --> 19:39.051
Why don't you sit here and hold hands
and try to figure it out.

19:53.275 --> 19:56.068
That's good, Emory.

20:00.407 --> 20:03.284
She's ready for her close-up now.

20:16.506 --> 20:18.299
We should get rid of her.

20:18.467 --> 20:22.428
She knows I sent Laura up here,
she knows her father owns the place.

20:22.596 --> 20:27.016
With what Ben Horne will pay to get
his funked-up little daughter back,

20:27.184 --> 20:28.809
I'll buy the bastard out.

20:28.977 --> 20:32.146
Look, I don't wanna lose my job.

20:34.775 --> 20:38.110
Honey, if this doesn't work,
you'll lose a lot more than your job.

20:38.278 --> 20:41.239
We can't handle this alone.
Ben Horne is dangerous.

20:41.406 --> 20:47.203
Now, listen, you spineless gasbag,
you are in this up to your shiny pate.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.664
Now, stop whining.

20:49.831 --> 20:54.710
You do as I tell you, and we'll have
all the help we need.

20:58.632 --> 21:01.175
Look at her.

21:01.343 --> 21:04.428
Riding the white tiger.

21:05.889 --> 21:09.267
In a few days
she won't wanna come down.

21:10.644 --> 21:13.646
Just like her daddy did to me.

21:14.356 --> 21:18.484
Now, these babies
are just perfect.

21:18.652 --> 21:22.655
For heavy field work,
and they're extremely versatile.

21:22.823 --> 21:26.951
- Durable, with a steel reinforced toe.
- Not quite right.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.705
Now, if the department does
any parading,

21:30.872 --> 21:35.710
on the Fourth or Veterans Day,
these are your best bet.

21:35.877 --> 21:37.044
- Nice, huh?
- Yeah.

21:37.212 --> 21:41.299
Add some silver-trimmed laces,
it's a real eye-catcher.

21:41.466 --> 21:44.427
I can see that. But a little outside
my budget, Mr. Gerard.

21:44.594 --> 21:45.970
I understand completely.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.097
- You need something more practical.
- Yep.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.309
A shoe for all seasons.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.396
Now, this is more like it.

21:56.023 --> 21:59.108
Yeah. Jim-dandy.

21:59.568 --> 22:03.070
Oh. Very popular.

22:04.281 --> 22:07.450
The lovely thing about...

22:07.617 --> 22:09.577
Mr. Gerard?

22:09.745 --> 22:11.245
Mr. Gerard, you okay?

22:11.455 --> 22:15.333
Oh. I'm sorry.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.543
Sometimes I get
a bit disoriented.

22:17.711 --> 22:20.546
Can I get you something?
Water?

22:21.173 --> 22:25.259
If there's a bathroom,
I have a medication.

22:25.427 --> 22:29.555
Sure. It's right down the hall.
This way.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.197
Thanks for coming down, Shelly.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.908
Sheriff, I'm just gonna say this:

22:49.076 --> 22:52.119
I know I don't have to, so I'm not
gonna say anything against Leo.

22:52.287 --> 22:54.121
We're not asking you to.

22:54.289 --> 22:57.291
He's my husband. I don't have
to testify against my husband.

22:57.626 --> 23:02.088
Well, you're not testifying.
You're just giving us a statement.

23:03.757 --> 23:06.342
Doc Hayward says he's too sick.

23:06.885 --> 23:09.053
What difference does it make?

23:09.471 --> 23:11.931
The difference, Shelly,
is there's some people injured

23:12.099 --> 23:13.974
and there's some people dead.

23:14.142 --> 23:17.186
Now, we know Leo started that fire.

23:17.604 --> 23:19.814
And we know you were there.

23:21.858 --> 23:25.277
I'm not gonna say anything
against him.

23:28.031 --> 23:29.365
I love him.

23:29.866 --> 23:33.369
Okay, Shelly, that's fine.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.830
- Thanks for coming in.
- What?

23:35.997 --> 23:39.417
Oh, I think Shelly's thought
long and hard about this.

23:39.584 --> 23:43.379
Maybe someday, with a little luck
and some topflight medical attention,

23:43.547 --> 23:44.922
you'll have Leo back.

23:45.757 --> 23:49.844
The same old Leo
that you obviously still love.

23:53.807 --> 23:58.269
Maybe then he'll realize what
a wonderful person he's married to.

23:58.437 --> 23:59.770
What?

23:59.938 --> 24:01.772
Thanks again, Shelly.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.649
Best of luck.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.445
What's going on?

24:07.612 --> 24:09.488
Smells like insurance money.

24:09.656 --> 24:11.490
Shelly didn't dream this up herself.

24:11.658 --> 24:13.701
So who do you think is
pulling the strings?

24:13.869 --> 24:15.119
Harry,

24:15.287 --> 24:17.037
that's a damn good question.

24:53.575 --> 24:54.742
Bob...

24:56.828 --> 24:59.497
...I know you're near.

25:04.628 --> 25:08.130
I'm after you now.

25:26.566 --> 25:30.945
- Mr. Horne?
- Tsk tsk. Gotta go, Jerry.

25:32.489 --> 25:35.115
Mr. Horne, have you heard
anything from your daughter?

25:35.283 --> 25:38.035
Not since I spoke to
Sheriff Truman yesterday.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.995
She phoned me last night.

25:40.163 --> 25:41.956
- From where?
- She didn't say.

25:42.123 --> 25:43.958
She referenced seeing me
in my tuxedo.

25:44.125 --> 25:47.795
Now, I was wearing a tux here
at the hotel the night that I was shot.

25:47.963 --> 25:52.007
Well, like I told you,
Audrey's gone missing before

25:52.175 --> 25:54.385
on a semi-regular basis.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.845
So have two other
local girls recently.

25:57.013 --> 25:59.431
Mr. Horne, speaking frankly,
is there trouble at home?

26:01.768 --> 26:03.686
Mr. Cooper,

26:03.853 --> 26:08.649
do I detect a note of something outside
the scope of professional concern?

26:09.609 --> 26:11.735
Audrey and I have struck up
an acquaintance.

26:12.028 --> 26:13.988
Acquaintance.

26:15.115 --> 26:17.491
Agent Cooper.

26:18.076 --> 26:21.787
Let me give you the best advice
that you're gonna get all week:

26:21.955 --> 26:24.373
Men fall under the spell
of Audrey's charms

26:24.541 --> 26:26.542
like ducks in a shooting gallery.

26:26.710 --> 26:31.547
And if you don't want a
load of buckshot in your tail feathers,

26:31.715 --> 26:36.385
may I suggest that you park your jalopy
outside of somebody else's window.

26:36.678 --> 26:41.640
Mr. Horne, if I've overstepped my
bounds with my concern, I apologize.

26:41.808 --> 26:44.101
I am here
with only the best intentions.

26:44.853 --> 26:47.146
That is achingly clear.

26:47.314 --> 26:49.398
And not unappreciated.

26:49.899 --> 26:51.525
I'll put a lamp in the window,

26:51.693 --> 26:55.613
you'll be my first call
when she comes home to roost.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.031
Thank you.

26:57.365 --> 27:00.743
No, thank you.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.983
Welcome back.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.277
Where am I?

27:35.779 --> 27:38.822
I brought you something.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.659
Open wide.

27:42.202 --> 27:44.203
English caramels.

27:44.371 --> 27:47.081
Sugar's what you need.

27:50.794 --> 27:54.338
- Please...
- Go slow, baby.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.548
Candy's dandy, huh?

27:56.716 --> 27:59.510
Plenty more where that came from.

28:07.811 --> 28:10.562
My name is Jean.

28:22.826 --> 28:24.660
Sweet sleep.

28:26.287 --> 28:28.956
Feel the warmth.

28:34.504 --> 28:35.879
That's the man.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.131
Oh, my God.

28:37.298 --> 28:38.882
- You know him?
- FBI.

28:39.050 --> 28:41.927
He's FBI. I saw him at the town
meeting after Laura died.

28:42.095 --> 28:43.429
He was up here?

28:43.596 --> 28:44.888
I want him.

28:45.056 --> 28:47.641
Jean Renault. Emory,

28:48.351 --> 28:51.395
say something weak and fawning.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.188
Jacques was your brother?

28:54.649 --> 28:57.735
And this is my sister. Nancy?

28:57.902 --> 29:01.530
I also had a brother, Bernard.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.866
This business cost me them both.

29:04.617 --> 29:07.786
I told you we'd have help.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.166
I'm your go-between.

29:12.333 --> 29:16.420
The father pays me,
my cut is 30 percent.

29:16.588 --> 29:19.298
The father never know
who snatch his baby.

29:19.466 --> 29:22.259
And I get the man
who kill my brother.

29:22.427 --> 29:23.886
What's his name?

29:24.345 --> 29:27.097
- Cooper.
- Cooper.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.975
And all you have to do
is bring him to me.

29:31.227 --> 29:34.188
Mr. Horne can maybe do that.

29:34.355 --> 29:38.525
But you're going to be a big help,
aren't you?

29:39.235 --> 29:42.112
Whatever you want...
Want me to do.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.907
The tape of the girl.
Get it now.

29:45.074 --> 29:47.159
Yes, all right.

29:50.538 --> 29:52.706
She goes back north,

29:52.874 --> 29:58.128
- or this deal goes south.
- Jean, tell my sister to behave herself,

29:58.296 --> 30:00.631
or you'll get mad.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.174
She stays.

30:02.342 --> 30:05.844
You get the money, I get Cooper.
Everybody happy.

30:09.516 --> 30:10.974
Of course, we...

30:11.142 --> 30:13.602
We can't let the girl live now,

30:13.770 --> 30:15.395
can we?

30:15.772 --> 30:19.358
No, no, no. Thanks, Pete.
I appreciate the call.

30:21.986 --> 30:23.862
Harry?

30:24.030 --> 30:25.864
Time for a break.

30:26.282 --> 30:29.159
Josie called Pete.
She'll be back tomorrow afternoon.

30:29.327 --> 30:31.245
Great. Let's bring her in.

30:31.412 --> 30:33.330
Coop, I need a favor.

30:38.461 --> 30:40.921
I'd like to see her first.
Alone.

30:41.464 --> 30:45.133
Harry, we can't let personal feelings
interfere with our work.

30:45.301 --> 30:46.844
Easier said than done.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.973
Talk to her.
Bring her in.

30:51.140 --> 30:53.892
You know there's a chance that
she's not involved with any of this.

30:54.060 --> 30:56.144
Harry, you have my blessing.

30:57.522 --> 31:01.608
Pearl Lakes. There's a vacant lot
next to the Palmer house.

31:01.776 --> 31:04.111
Next to that there's a white house
all boarded up.

31:04.279 --> 31:07.698
- Mailbox, no name on it.
- Title check?

31:07.866 --> 31:11.034
County's working on it. Power and
Lights are searching their records.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.745
- How soon before we know?
- Morning, earliest.

31:13.913 --> 31:15.998
Hawk, you haven't seen Mr. Gerard,
have you?

31:16.165 --> 31:18.375
- Shoe salesman?
- The one-armed man?

31:18.543 --> 31:19.960
He came in to show me
some samples.

31:20.461 --> 31:22.045
The one-armed man was here?

31:22.213 --> 31:24.882
Yeah, he got faint
and had to go to the bathroom.

31:25.049 --> 31:26.758
Never came back.

31:26.926 --> 31:30.637
Harry, remember in my dream?
The one-armed man knew Bob.

31:44.068 --> 31:45.444
What's going on?

31:55.371 --> 31:59.166
"Without chemicals, he points."

31:59.334 --> 32:02.169
The Giant's third clue.

32:02.337 --> 32:06.298
Harry, we've got to find
the one-armed man.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.355
Is that really necessary, doc?

32:21.522 --> 32:23.231
It's for her own protection, Ed.

32:23.399 --> 32:25.776
She ripped two pair
of leather restraints last night

32:25.944 --> 32:29.237
like tissue paper.
I ran a blood test.

32:29.405 --> 32:32.449
She's pumping out more adrenaline
than a wildcat well.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.534
Never seen anything like it.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.788
Now, your being here
may quiet her.

32:37.956 --> 32:41.833
Talk to her. Maybe sing.
She got a favorite song?

32:42.001 --> 32:43.919
Favorite song?

32:44.587 --> 32:47.005
Beats a trip to Lourdes.

32:47.173 --> 32:49.007
Okay.

32:49.509 --> 32:53.428
But if I'm gonna sing to her, doc,
I'd rather it was just the two of us.

32:53.596 --> 32:57.599
I'll close the door behind me.

33:04.023 --> 33:05.983
Nadine?

33:06.150 --> 33:09.486
Doc says I should sing a song for you.

33:10.697 --> 33:14.199
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm not sure what you'd like to hear.

33:22.834 --> 33:26.294
On top of Old Smokey

33:26.713 --> 33:30.590
All covered with snow

33:31.551 --> 33:35.429
I lost my true lover

33:36.305 --> 33:39.349
A-courtin' too slow

33:40.852 --> 33:44.312
Courting's a pleasure

33:44.480 --> 33:48.608
Parting's a grief

33:48.776 --> 33:51.111
A false-hearted lover

33:51.738 --> 33:57.284
Is worse than a thief

33:59.787 --> 34:01.621
Good God.

34:09.255 --> 34:12.257
You're a jack and I'm a jack
And Steeplejacks are we

34:12.425 --> 34:14.259
And when we climb up to the top

34:14.427 --> 34:16.803
The cry is victory!

34:16.971 --> 34:20.515
V-I-C-T-O-R-Y!

34:20.683 --> 34:22.726
Vi...

34:22.894 --> 34:25.228
Hi, Eddie.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.439
Did you come by
to pick me up?

34:28.441 --> 34:29.941
Uh-huh.

34:30.443 --> 34:34.279
Doc Hayward says
tonsillitis or no tonsillitis,

34:34.447 --> 34:37.324
I can go to cheerleading tryouts.

34:37.992 --> 34:39.576
Cheerleader tryouts?

34:40.244 --> 34:42.871
Well, I'm a senior, Eddie.

34:43.039 --> 34:45.624
You know what they say. Heh.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.629
You're only 18 once.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.708
Dr. Jacoby?

35:28.876 --> 35:31.336
Gents. Come on in.

35:32.296 --> 35:34.923
This is my wife, Eolani.

35:35.591 --> 35:38.969
She lives at our place in Hanalei.

35:39.137 --> 35:44.724
We're... Well, we're practicing
a kind of creative kahuna healing.

35:44.892 --> 35:46.935
- How do you do?
- Ma'am.

35:48.729 --> 35:50.480
Are you ready to be hypnotized?

35:51.315 --> 35:55.443
Oh. Yes, yes.
I've been under many times.

35:56.487 --> 36:00.824
This is the autosuggestion program
that I use.

36:00.992 --> 36:03.660
Eolani, start the tape, please.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.204
Sheriff Truman.

36:07.874 --> 36:12.169
Would you hold this stone, please,
at the end of the bed there?

36:15.298 --> 36:16.464
Great. Just...

36:17.550 --> 36:19.467
Yes. Whoa.

36:21.345 --> 36:25.265
Okay, Agent Cooper.
I'm ready.

36:27.435 --> 36:31.146
"You are standing on
a smooth, green carpet of grass.

36:31.314 --> 36:34.524
The ball is 15 feet from the hole.

36:37.653 --> 36:41.364
Beyond the green,
two pristine white sand traps

36:41.532 --> 36:45.619
and a lily-filled pond yawn out
towards the emerald fairway.

36:45.786 --> 36:49.497
The hole seems to slowly drift away
across the green

36:49.665 --> 36:52.918
towards the pond,
carried by the summer wind.

36:53.085 --> 36:56.463
The green grows larger and larger.

36:56.631 --> 36:58.548
The green engulfs you,

36:58.716 --> 37:03.011
enveloping you
in a soft blanket of peace.

37:03.179 --> 37:04.638
Harry.

37:06.432 --> 37:09.017
You stroke the ball.

37:09.393 --> 37:15.232
It drifts towards the hole
and gently drops in its center."

37:15.399 --> 37:17.692
Can you hear me, Dr. Jacoby?

37:18.653 --> 37:19.819
Yes.

37:20.446 --> 37:24.616
You're in your hospital room.
In the room is Jacques Renault.

37:24.784 --> 37:29.037
Do you smell anything?
Burned engine oil?

37:29.205 --> 37:32.749
I smell engine oil at the park.

37:33.376 --> 37:34.960
Air is filled with it.

37:35.753 --> 37:38.713
All right, we're going back to your room
at the hospital now.

37:38.881 --> 37:40.799
Does anyone come into the room?

37:40.967 --> 37:42.509
Nurses,

37:42.677 --> 37:44.135
Doc Hayward.

37:44.303 --> 37:46.596
You, Sheriff Truman.

37:46.764 --> 37:48.348
What happens after we leave?

37:49.267 --> 37:51.893
I dream I'm at Hanauma Bay.

37:52.061 --> 37:54.646
I'm juggling coconuts at a luau.

37:54.981 --> 37:58.108
The guests are all Nigerians.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.402
All right.

38:00.569 --> 38:03.363
Does anyone else come into the room,
later that night?

38:04.699 --> 38:07.784
The sound of the tape ripping
wakes me up.

38:07.952 --> 38:10.829
I see a pillow going over his face.

38:10.997 --> 38:14.165
He's making this sound.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.630
Almost like a dog barking.

38:21.048 --> 38:23.341
Jacques stops moving.

38:23.509 --> 38:26.761
I look up to see
who's holding the pillow.

38:26.929 --> 38:28.388
Who is it?

38:28.556 --> 38:29.889
Do you see who it is?

38:30.057 --> 38:31.766
I know him.

38:52.204 --> 38:53.955
Hi.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.836
This is from Harold Smith.

39:01.047 --> 39:04.132
Sorry I haven't been out
to see you since the funeral,

39:04.300 --> 39:06.926
but things have been
pretty strange.

39:08.012 --> 39:11.556
So were you sleeping with
this guy Harold or what?

39:11.724 --> 39:13.933
He seems pretty nice.

39:14.101 --> 39:16.311
Kind of an oddball.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.525
Although, I guess anyone
can start to seem like that

39:22.693 --> 39:24.944
when you look close enough.

39:28.741 --> 39:30.825
We need to talk.

39:31.619 --> 39:34.079
Maybe you already know
about me and James.

39:34.246 --> 39:39.793
But anyway, after you died,
we kind of got together.

39:39.960 --> 39:43.713
This isn't something
I feel like I have to explain to you

39:44.965 --> 39:48.468
because you probably knew
how we felt before we did.

39:49.804 --> 39:53.390
How can you be so smart
about things like that...

39:54.600 --> 39:57.852
...and so stupid
about so much else?

40:01.023 --> 40:02.607
I'm mad at you.

40:02.775 --> 40:06.945
When it was you and me
and James, it kind of worked.

40:07.113 --> 40:08.488
Now you're gone.

40:08.656 --> 40:10.782
I love James.

40:10.950 --> 40:13.076
And it's a mess.

40:14.745 --> 40:16.955
Your cousin Maddy's here,

40:17.123 --> 40:20.667
and I think there's something going on
between the two of them.

40:22.294 --> 40:25.880
And I'm afraid I'm gonna end up
losing both of you.

40:30.803 --> 40:34.389
I wanted so much to be like you,
Laura.

40:35.808 --> 40:41.104
To have your strength
and your courage.

40:43.065 --> 40:45.608
But look what it did.

40:47.945 --> 40:50.155
Look what it did to you.

40:52.616 --> 40:54.826
As much as I love you, Laura,

40:54.994 --> 40:59.289
most of the time we were trying
to solve your problems.

40:59.457 --> 41:02.083
And you know what?
We still are.

41:02.251 --> 41:05.545
Not mine or James' or Maddy's.
Yours.

41:05.713 --> 41:09.424
You're dead, Laura, but your problems
keep hanging around.

41:09.592 --> 41:12.552
It's almost like they didn't bury you
deep enough!

41:18.976 --> 41:20.018
James.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.395
I'm looking for Donna.
I can't find her.

41:22.563 --> 41:24.564
I just gotta talk to somebody.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.399
What's wrong, James?

41:26.567 --> 41:27.817
She came home.

41:27.985 --> 41:29.319
Who?

41:29.487 --> 41:33.323
My mom was all loaded.
She was all screwed up.

41:33.491 --> 41:34.908
God, I hate her.

41:35.075 --> 41:37.994
James, no.

41:38.162 --> 41:40.330
God, you're on fire.

41:50.466 --> 41:52.425
Hold me.

42:06.899 --> 42:08.233
Oh, my God.

42:08.901 --> 42:09.943
Donna.

42:12.279 --> 42:23.206
Donna!

42:24.333 --> 42:26.084
Why?!

42:33.676 --> 42:36.553
All I did was come to a funeral.

42:39.223 --> 42:43.601
And it's like I fell into a dream.

42:46.188 --> 42:49.399
It's like people think

42:49.567 --> 42:52.652
I'm Laura.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.988
And I'm not.

42:55.447 --> 42:59.242
- I'm nothing like Laura.
- It's so hard, I know.

42:59.410 --> 43:01.869
I know, sweetheart.
I know.

43:02.037 --> 43:06.457
All I know is that Laura
was my cousin,

43:06.625 --> 43:10.545
and I loved her and she died.

43:10.713 --> 43:13.506
I don't know anything else.

43:14.174 --> 43:17.010
You just want life to be the way
it was before.

43:17.177 --> 43:19.637
- Yeah.
- So do I.

43:20.264 --> 43:21.973
We all do.

43:23.017 --> 43:25.268
And try as we might,
it just won't cooperate, will it?

43:25.436 --> 43:27.145
No.

43:30.065 --> 43:32.025
Oh, baby.

43:32.735 --> 43:36.112
If life could only be like
those summers up at...

43:36.280 --> 43:37.947
...Pearl Lakes.

43:40.576 --> 43:41.659
Leland?

43:45.039 --> 43:47.290
The door was open.

43:48.792 --> 43:50.084
Leland...

43:51.253 --> 43:52.503
What is it?

43:57.176 --> 44:00.178
Leland, you're under arrest
for the murder of Jacques Renault.

44:17.613 --> 44:19.989
I'm sorry, I didn't know
where else to go.

44:20.157 --> 44:22.825
Donna.
What's wrong?

44:22.993 --> 44:26.746
I don't even know if I want to
talk about it, I feel so stupid.

44:27.373 --> 44:29.207
Slow down.

44:29.375 --> 44:31.417
Sit down.

44:32.169 --> 44:34.212
I keep telling myself
that he's confused,

44:34.380 --> 44:37.048
but how much longer
am I supposed to think that?

44:37.216 --> 44:40.176
- James Hurley?
- Yeah.

44:40.344 --> 44:42.512
Just when I thought I had it
all figured out.

44:42.680 --> 44:45.014
Why do I even care?
Why should I?

44:45.182 --> 44:48.976
Well, you care
because you care for him.

44:49.144 --> 44:54.148
- Don't you?
- I wish I didn't. I just want it to stop.

44:54.316 --> 44:55.858
First, you have to stop.

44:56.026 --> 44:59.487
Hey, what was it she
used to say?

45:00.989 --> 45:04.909
"Donna Madonna,
there's always mañana."

45:05.077 --> 45:07.203
How did you know that?

45:15.003 --> 45:19.257
- I'll get you something to drink, okay?
- Okay.
