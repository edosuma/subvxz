01:12.540 --> 01:13.641
You gonna share that thing or
what?

01:13.674 --> 01:16.410
No, not really, but go ahead.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.253
- I like this spot, man.
- Yeah, it's not...

01:25.286 --> 01:26.454
I think you're gonna do well
here.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.256
- It's good.
- I feel it.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.324
It'll be good.

01:30.358 --> 01:31.259
Thank you.

01:33.361 --> 01:37.598
What are you gonna do
if this shit goes legal?

01:37.631 --> 01:41.402
More people growing,
more people buying lights,

01:41.435 --> 01:44.238
electric, open up another store.

01:49.277 --> 01:52.413
Maybe I'll be a big box
hydroponic guy.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.283
High volume, low prices.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.224
I'll tell you what, this
stuff goes completely legal,

02:03.257 --> 02:07.161
you're gonna be the guy
that's in shit, man.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.669
- Okay.
- Yeah.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.972
My advice to you, if I was you,

02:52.005 --> 02:54.642
I would get the fuck out of here

02:56.677 --> 02:59.613
and start a new business with
a better class of people,

02:59.647 --> 03:03.317
you know, go to some
place that's tropical.

03:03.351 --> 03:06.287
- Okay.
- Where it's sunny everyday.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.755
Away from people like you and
me?

03:07.788 --> 03:08.756
Far away.

03:17.465 --> 03:18.165
Yeah.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.437
You going back in?

03:23.471 --> 03:25.573
Yeah, I'll lock up.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.375
Here.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.509
- I'm studying.
- Okay.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.577
See ya.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.225
French.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.842
- Where is it?
- Upstairs!

04:13.387 --> 04:15.055
What kind of food do
you want to get into

04:15.088 --> 04:17.425
to celebrate the new store?

04:19.793 --> 04:21.629
I feel like Cambodian tonight.

04:21.661 --> 04:22.296
- Okay.
- All right?

04:27.868 --> 04:30.471
Ah fuck, I gotta roll, man.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.476
So you going to
teach me some Spanish?

06:15.509 --> 06:16.744
What's up?

06:16.777 --> 06:18.646
Okay, let's do those numbers.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.614
You gotta get the numbers down.

06:20.648 --> 06:22.650
Okay, what's 14?

06:24.885 --> 06:26.720
They're gonna be impressed
that you speak Spanish

06:26.754 --> 06:30.591
and we're gonna need
it for this restaurant.

06:30.624 --> 06:31.759
And then now we get into the
easy ones,

06:31.792 --> 06:33.794
it's 10 plus the number.

06:37.565 --> 06:38.466
Damn!

06:41.669 --> 06:44.638
How do you say marijuana in
Spanish?

06:44.672 --> 06:45.539
Prison.

07:22.710 --> 07:26.046
- I've heard this before.
- He's smiling.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.616
Seriously, that's what I'm
saying.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.484
We're out and he's happy about
it.

07:30.518 --> 07:31.619
He's happy.
I can see that.

07:31.652 --> 07:32.820
I know.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.555
You all are crazy.
Is that purple king?

07:34.588 --> 07:35.689
Purple king?

07:35.723 --> 07:37.891
- What?
- That's what I smell.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.993
That's nice.
It is nice.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.931
This is the last crop.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.634
Seems like I've heard that
before.

07:46.667 --> 07:50.003
You've heard it before
but this is the real one.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.038
Wow, okay.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.842
What are you gonna do?

07:54.875 --> 07:56.710
You still on about the
restaurant?

07:56.744 --> 07:58.045
This is the plan for real?
Yep, yep.

07:58.078 --> 07:59.713
You guys are gonna open a
restaurant?

07:59.747 --> 08:02.015
- Yep.
- We're done, that's it.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.785
Nicaragua, you coming or what?

08:04.818 --> 08:06.520
Yeah, what am I gonna do, flip
burgers?

08:06.554 --> 08:07.821
No, you can be the bartender.

08:07.855 --> 08:08.989
Oh, the bartender, thanks.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.725
I'll make you guys your sugary
drinks.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.561
Sea Breeze, anyone?

08:13.594 --> 08:14.494
You too!

08:15.829 --> 08:17.097
1333 East 20th.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.869
He's got about 100 pounds in
there

08:21.902 --> 08:24.037
and I'm sure it's Carter's.

08:32.613 --> 08:33.847
I can't believe you're
back.

08:33.881 --> 08:37.017
I would have taken that
injury money and split.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.919
Not my way.

08:38.952 --> 08:39.852
Show him the scar.

08:39.886 --> 08:42.155
Fucking scar, it's a fucking
bear trap.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.592
Crushed my fuckin' leg bone and
ligament

08:44.625 --> 08:47.895
in Carter's grow-op and got
diddly-squat.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.772
- This it?
- Yeah.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.741
Got two kids at home,
Bernie, Christmas morning,

09:00.774 --> 09:01.775
let's fuckin' make this quick.

09:01.809 --> 09:02.976
Yes, sir.

09:03.010 --> 09:06.046
You're suck a fuckin' hotshot.
Carl, with me, let's go.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.948
Stay in the back here
so that squirrelly whirly

09:07.981 --> 09:09.950
doesn't find a hole to crawl out
of.

09:14.855 --> 09:15.522
Police, police!

09:15.555 --> 09:17.057
Right there, right there, hands!

09:17.090 --> 09:17.958
- Let me see your hands!
- Hands in the air!

09:17.991 --> 09:20.661
Down on the ground now!

09:20.694 --> 09:21.595
Put your hands behind your back.

09:21.629 --> 09:24.832
Your hands behind your back.
I got him.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.700
All right, I got him.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.739
What the fuck is this?

09:31.772 --> 09:33.674
What the fuck is this?

09:35.042 --> 09:36.677
Hockey
equipment, Bernie, really?

09:36.710 --> 09:38.211
Where'd you get this
robe?

09:38.245 --> 09:40.814
No go, bullshit!

09:43.116 --> 09:45.118
And you've been watching this
clown?

09:45.152 --> 09:47.187
Let's check the car.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.689
Where is it?

09:48.722 --> 09:51.692
Here, check out his
shitbox.

09:51.725 --> 09:55.395
Fucking hockey equipment,
are you fucking serious?

09:55.428 --> 09:56.730
So.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.868
Come on.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.041
Yeah, stupid.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.645
Fuckin' lie to me?

10:11.679 --> 10:12.913
You fuckin' hold back on me?

10:12.946 --> 10:14.014
You know what I can fuckin' do?

10:14.047 --> 10:15.716
See what I can fuckin' do?

10:15.749 --> 10:16.817
I can do fuckin' anything.

10:21.855 --> 10:22.756
Good.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.694
Bernie is gonna lose his
fuckin' mind.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.195
Carl, Bernie is a useless
piece of shit,

10:28.228 --> 10:30.097
you understand me?

10:30.130 --> 10:31.799
Where's Carter growing this
shit?

10:31.832 --> 10:35.002
Nothing, Bernie,
nothing.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.169
Where is it?

10:37.771 --> 10:38.906
Where the fuck?

10:40.240 --> 10:41.942
Where the fuck
Hey, hey, hey!

10:41.975 --> 10:42.575
- Is Carter growing this shit?
- All right, all right.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.244
Hey, let's go!

10:44.277 --> 10:45.779
Get outta here!

10:47.147 --> 10:49.750
This ain't the last time,
little bubba.

10:49.783 --> 10:53.053
You're gonna be seeing us again
real soon.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.757
- All right, on your feet.
- What the fuck?

10:56.790 --> 10:58.258
- Come on, let's go.
- Fuck.

10:58.291 --> 11:01.028
Tell Carter I'm coming for him.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.298
Simon, you didn't see anybody
come around back, right?

11:05.332 --> 11:06.233
No, no.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.035
Bernie, I think you're
gonna have to find

11:08.068 --> 11:11.238
this Carter character next year,
buddy.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.172
Fuck.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.145
What do you think about
leaving earlier?

11:18.178 --> 11:20.714
Like a week from now?

11:20.748 --> 11:22.816
- I think I can't.
- How come?

11:22.850 --> 11:23.784
I've got
the house to deal with,

11:23.817 --> 11:26.053
and I've got to wait
on the divorce papers.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.054
Forget the divorce papers.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.923
You get the lawyer to
deal with it, it's done.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.925
I can't do that.

11:31.959 --> 11:34.227
Mark just lost his plumbing
license or ticket or whatever.

11:34.261 --> 11:35.896
He doesn't have a job and he's
depressed.

11:35.929 --> 11:39.767
You're fired.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.507
Hey.
Hey, you got a second?

11:47.540 --> 11:51.879
All right, listen, so the
hockey equipment got taken.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.246
The bags are gone.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.083
What does that mean?

11:56.116 --> 11:57.818
Look, just, whatever you do,

11:57.851 --> 12:00.053
don't go to the old spot, okay?

12:00.087 --> 12:01.822
Move to a new spot.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.024
We'll figure this out, okay?

12:04.057 --> 12:05.325
But just...
Dude.

12:06.794 --> 12:09.096
My life's in those bags.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.259
How's it going?

12:39.292 --> 12:41.929
Hey, man, going well.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.897
I'm excited, got my first
customer.

12:43.931 --> 12:44.798
Oh, yeah, for what?

12:44.832 --> 12:46.366
Mm, come see.

12:47.835 --> 12:48.969
Get in there.

12:49.002 --> 12:52.005
I haven't even tried it yet.

12:52.039 --> 12:54.041
- You made that?
- Yeah.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.143
You look surprised.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.144
Why you look so surprised?

12:57.177 --> 12:59.312
- Come on, man.
- What, you think I bought it?

12:59.346 --> 13:01.581
- Yeah, you fuckin' bought it.
- I didn't buy it.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.150
You didn't fuckin' shit.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.384
I'm eating it.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.954
It better be fucking good.
It's good.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.122
I don't get sick.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.091
Mm.
So what you think?

13:12.025 --> 13:13.961
Club Kamikaze?

13:13.994 --> 13:14.828
And I know what you're thinking.

13:14.862 --> 13:17.397
Raw fish in Nicaragua with that
heat,

13:17.430 --> 13:19.933
that might be a problem, but
those cats have some iron guts

13:19.967 --> 13:22.369
so we're in the clear.
I need you to do me a favor

13:22.402 --> 13:25.372
and fire this back up for one
more crop.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.273
This is the last crop, man.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.441
I'm cutting it tomorrow, you
know that.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.944
I know but I'm in a jam.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.414
Zack lost all the weed.

13:39.887 --> 13:43.423
A man's got to know
his limitations, Carter.

13:44.391 --> 13:48.228
That cultivation license is
our ticket out of here now.

13:48.261 --> 13:51.398
You got to call Frank about
his psychiatrist uncle.

13:51.431 --> 13:54.301
We got to find a guy to grow for
us

13:54.334 --> 13:57.304
and send us the money to
Nicaragua.

14:01.041 --> 14:04.211
Frank, I just came from your
uncle's.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.147
He wants me to come back down
there.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.882
I gave you guys $10,000.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.083
You told me in and out no
problem,

14:10.117 --> 14:11.184
I get the cultivation license.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.086
I went in, I did my part.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.889
He's saying he wants to me to
go back in there in a week.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.324
I don't have a week.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.859
Man, he's really nervous.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.364
He thinks the place is being
bugged.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.100
Come on, man, buck up.

14:27.134 --> 14:30.503
Go back in there and tell him
some real mental problems.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.406
You gotta prove you're screwed
up.

14:35.342 --> 14:39.246
Go do it, one more
time, man, come on, now.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.147
Fuck.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.149
At the beginning,

14:42.182 --> 14:45.085
you use this white light
when the plants are small.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.019
Okay.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.187
When the plants get taller,

14:47.220 --> 14:50.357
you switch from the white
light to this yellow light.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.158
Oh okay.

14:51.191 --> 14:54.227
Okay, so, white lights, 12
hours,

14:54.261 --> 14:55.996
and then the yellow light, 24...

14:56.029 --> 14:57.697
David, this is important.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.500
You're going to fuck with
the universe of these plants.

15:00.533 --> 15:04.004
White light for 24 hours, so no
darkness.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.372
Then the second and final stage,

15:05.405 --> 15:08.942
12 hours of darkness, 12
hours of yellow light.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.410
See, when you switch
from white to the yellow,

15:10.443 --> 15:12.445
the plant panics and starts
producing buds

15:12.479 --> 15:14.281
'cause they think that summer is
over

15:14.314 --> 15:16.283
and it prepares to die.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.526
How many phones you got?

15:26.559 --> 15:28.461
- One.
- Give it to me.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.268
A flip phone?
Yeah, why?

15:35.302 --> 15:37.104
I don't know.

15:37.137 --> 15:41.141
Look, this is a double
encrypted phone, here.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.576
No photos, no personal
information,

15:43.610 --> 15:45.412
and you only use your handle.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.980
Handle?

15:47.014 --> 15:50.050
- Yeah, your username.
- What's my username?

15:50.083 --> 15:53.320
ItalianStallion69,
Carter said you're Italian.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.255
- Italian Stallion?
- Yeah.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.289
- What's yours?
- I don't have one yet.

15:56.323 --> 15:57.991
These phones are new.

15:58.025 --> 16:01.028
- How about yours?
- Latin Heat.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.562
- Latin Heat?
- Look.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.465
If the cops get this phone,
put in a wrong password twice,

16:05.498 --> 16:08.201
it scrambles the network and
sends a message to the server

16:08.235 --> 16:11.004
that it's been compromised,
okay?

16:11.038 --> 16:13.473
So, if you get any trouble
and you need a piece,

16:13.506 --> 16:15.375
come see me.
A piece?

16:19.146 --> 16:20.613
I thought this was legal.
It is legal.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.082
Yeah, it's legal, it's legal.

16:22.115 --> 16:25.418
Just, you know, in case anything
happens.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.587
You'll be fine.
Come here.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.595
I bring you the fucking kid
and you pull out a fucking gun?

16:35.628 --> 16:37.230
- You want him to be safe?
- Yeah.

16:37.264 --> 16:38.398
That's why I brought the gun.

16:38.431 --> 16:41.568
Look, this kid's no grower.
That's why he's perfect.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.270
He looks innocent.

16:45.272 --> 16:49.376
Yeah, innocent, that's
a good name for it.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.310
Come on.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.413
It's okay.

17:13.099 --> 17:14.601
Got how it works over
there?

17:14.634 --> 17:16.569
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.405
And you got a one-hour window
everyday

17:18.438 --> 17:20.607
to leave and go get food.

17:20.640 --> 17:24.511
No friends, no family, no
girlfriends, no ex-girlfriends.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.446
Just be calm, cool, and
collected.

17:34.321 --> 17:39.159
This guy I had a house with
set up a bunch of bear traps

17:39.192 --> 17:42.429
around the place, and a cop
ended up stepping on one of them

17:42.462 --> 17:44.464
and couldn't walk again.

17:46.666 --> 17:47.900
So I don't want anything stupid,

17:47.934 --> 17:50.337
you got nothing to be worried
about here, everything's cool.

17:50.370 --> 17:54.441
The place is legal, I've
got the license, okay?

17:54.474 --> 17:56.876
- Yeah, you got it.
- Okay.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.578
- Let's do it.
- Okay, cool.

17:58.611 --> 18:01.414
All right, brother, let's do it.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.589
So, I'm in a fucking jam.

18:12.759 --> 18:16.363
There's a delay with this shrink
that I've been dealing with

18:16.396 --> 18:20.400
for the cultivation
license, and I was wondering

18:21.668 --> 18:25.238
if you know somebody that knows
somebody

18:26.306 --> 18:28.741
that can get me a different one

18:28.775 --> 18:31.611
or if you want to get involved.

18:31.644 --> 18:36.115
Look, if I were you I'd be
getting rid of this Italian kid

18:38.185 --> 18:39.186
and laying low.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.153
It's going to go legal.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.222
I can't fucking wait, man.

18:42.255 --> 18:46.359
If pot goes legal, the price
will tank and I'm done.

18:50.197 --> 18:53.166
You know, I knew this one
shrink

18:53.200 --> 18:55.602
and he was selling locations to
bikers

18:55.635 --> 18:57.670
and everybody got robbed.

18:58.771 --> 18:59.906
It's gonna go legal.

18:59.939 --> 19:04.244
This is the worst time to
be doing what you're doing.

19:06.513 --> 19:07.614
So just chill.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.519
Make a taco.
You're killing me.

19:51.258 --> 19:53.260
Where the fuck are you guys?

19:53.293 --> 19:55.828
You said 8:30.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.478
Carter?

20:37.504 --> 20:38.338
It's about fuckin' time.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.872
I've been waiting here half an
hour.

20:39.906 --> 20:40.773
No Vince?

20:42.375 --> 20:43.443
This is Carter's spot?

20:43.476 --> 20:44.844
Oh yeah.

20:49.782 --> 20:52.452
Simon, around the front, fast!

21:16.909 --> 21:18.277
Over here.

21:24.884 --> 21:27.687
Black, 34 years old, deceased.

21:35.428 --> 21:36.796
Electrocuted.

21:36.829 --> 21:37.864
Earl Freeman.

21:45.872 --> 21:46.773
Any cash?

21:48.575 --> 21:50.543
No, nothing.

21:50.577 --> 21:51.444
You?

22:23.443 --> 22:24.811
Bernie?

22:25.745 --> 22:27.346
Yeah, I'm back.

22:27.914 --> 22:31.451
I thought those guys shut you
down

22:31.484 --> 22:33.886
with all the medical licensing.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.723
Any cash?

22:36.756 --> 22:37.857
Nothing.

22:37.890 --> 22:41.394
This guy's been dead less than
an hour.

22:41.428 --> 22:43.763
I'd say sometime around eight.

22:45.498 --> 22:48.401
- You guys were here at 8:30?
- I was waiting around back

22:48.435 --> 22:49.469
in the alley,

22:49.502 --> 22:51.904
but we didn't come in
until a little after 8:30.

22:51.938 --> 22:54.641
We were dealing with the
Sarge on the new postings, so.

22:54.674 --> 22:57.944
- We were here 8:30 tops.
- And you were here?

22:57.977 --> 22:59.746
Eight o'clock.

22:59.779 --> 23:00.647
Alone?

23:03.450 --> 23:05.852
No, with my imaginary friend.

23:06.786 --> 23:09.021
Yes, alone, that's my fucking
job

23:09.055 --> 23:12.892
as lead investigator of
this here Green Team.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.528
Hail Caesar.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.777
Both the bear trap house
and the Freeman house

23:30.810 --> 23:31.744
were run by Carter.

23:31.778 --> 23:34.547
I just need a little
more time to corner him

23:34.581 --> 23:35.815
with this phone.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.020
There is no Carter.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.155
And quite frankly,

23:43.189 --> 23:46.659
I don't give a goddamn
whose grow-op it is anyways.

23:46.693 --> 23:48.060
We have a homicide

23:48.094 --> 23:50.997
and you were the only
one who was there alone.

23:51.030 --> 23:53.633
So now we got two.
Two what?

23:54.967 --> 23:56.035
We've got the three hockey
bags

23:56.068 --> 23:57.904
from Zack's place at Christmas,

23:57.937 --> 24:00.940
and we've got the 105 plants
from the Freeman house.

24:00.973 --> 24:03.476
There were no hockey bags at
Christmas,

24:03.510 --> 24:04.944
and there was no pot there
today.

24:04.977 --> 24:05.845
Exactly.

24:08.615 --> 24:11.484
So from where I'm sitting,

24:11.518 --> 24:15.021
you're either involved
in the Freeman murder,

24:16.022 --> 24:17.857
or I gotta ask myself,

24:17.890 --> 24:19.692
what the fuck kind of
detective stakes out a house

24:19.726 --> 24:21.494
while a murder is going down
inside?

24:21.528 --> 24:22.729
Boss, come on, that thing
slipped

24:22.762 --> 24:24.864
by the eyes in the back
of my fuckin' head.

24:24.897 --> 24:28.000
These people are fuckin'
animals, you know that.

24:28.034 --> 24:30.503
You're Internal
Investigations' prime suspect.

24:30.537 --> 24:31.704
What?

24:31.738 --> 24:33.272
You're suspended.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.676
That bear trap nearly
chopped off my fucking leg.

24:36.709 --> 24:39.979
I turned down the payoff to get
this guy!

25:32.965 --> 25:33.866
Hi.

25:35.768 --> 25:36.669
Hey.

25:38.137 --> 25:39.071
We were thinking it'd be great

25:39.105 --> 25:43.009
if could get the divorce
papers signed today.

25:46.813 --> 25:50.016
It's not really funny, Carter.
Oh.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.017
Can you witness them?

25:51.050 --> 25:52.251
It doesn't matter who
signs them, it's just...

25:52.284 --> 25:56.656
Your truck's leaking antifreeze
all over the driveway.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.160
Mark.

26:14.974 --> 26:19.045
Hey, man, I'm glad you
decided to come by, but.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.682
What, you wanna fight me?
Fuckin' right I fuckin' do.

26:23.249 --> 26:24.817
Get the fuck up.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.857
Stay the fuck away from my wife.

26:42.068 --> 26:44.704
Are you okay?

26:44.737 --> 26:46.205
Carter, are you okay?

26:50.209 --> 26:53.880
Look at me.

26:56.015 --> 26:57.850
- Hello.
- Carter?

26:57.884 --> 26:59.786
Who's this?

27:08.260 --> 27:09.128
Hands up.

27:09.161 --> 27:10.797
You fuckin' deaf?

27:12.298 --> 27:13.165
I'm a cop.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.102
You're Carter Holmes.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.870
You must be Alexis.

27:20.139 --> 27:23.142
Now, your friend Earl
Freeman was murdered today

27:23.175 --> 27:25.211
in one of your grow-ops.

27:25.244 --> 27:27.680
Robbed then electrocuted.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.950
And you're gonna help me find
the piece of shit who did it

27:30.983 --> 27:33.285
or I'm taking you in.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.989
See, Alexis's name is all over
the lease of the grow house.

27:37.023 --> 27:39.726
And she's either gonna cut
herself a deal

27:39.759 --> 27:41.127
or you're gonna come work for
me.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.830
I'm a mechanic, I fix
up cars and I re-sell them

27:43.863 --> 27:45.965
Put on the jewelry, hon.

27:46.933 --> 27:47.767
Carter.

27:47.800 --> 27:51.070
Here, put on the old Soviet
jewelry.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.004
Do it.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.209
I don't know anybody named
Earl.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.983
Come.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.251
Don't try to run.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.053
I'm a sharpshooter, baby, and
I don't give a fuck who I hit.

28:07.086 --> 28:07.987
Come here!

28:23.035 --> 28:24.703
Please!

28:26.806 --> 28:28.174
Get me out of here!

29:31.838 --> 29:33.039
Can I come in?

29:37.109 --> 29:38.010
You okay?

29:42.181 --> 29:43.049
Get out.

29:44.350 --> 29:47.987
Fuckin' boy, you stay the
fuck back there, peppy.

29:48.020 --> 29:50.256
I got an itchy trigger finger.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.959
Get out, get her out of there.

29:54.861 --> 29:57.163
This just might be your lucky
break.

29:57.196 --> 29:59.165
Get over there.

29:59.198 --> 30:01.100
Keep moving, keep moving.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.836
I swear there's nothing
fuckin' stopping me

30:03.870 --> 30:04.670
from pulling a straight bullet

30:04.703 --> 30:07.373
and fuck the both of you right
now.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.377
Kneel down right there.

30:11.410 --> 30:12.845
Kneel down!

30:12.879 --> 30:15.147
- Look, look.
- Kneel down!

30:15.181 --> 30:16.983
Hey, hey, I know
Earl.

30:19.651 --> 30:20.386
Please!

30:24.356 --> 30:28.961
Okay, you're the only connection
I got to Earl's murder.

30:28.995 --> 30:31.263
You gotta help me fuckin' find
this guy.

30:31.297 --> 30:32.198
I will, I will.

30:32.231 --> 30:33.165
- You will?
- Yeah.

30:33.199 --> 30:36.102
See how easy it is
when you're agreeable?

30:36.135 --> 30:38.104
What's with her?

30:38.137 --> 30:40.907
She's fainting.

30:40.940 --> 30:41.440
Get her in the car.

30:41.473 --> 30:42.875
Babe, babe.

30:55.421 --> 30:56.322
Babe.

31:02.361 --> 31:05.497
Babe, I love you so much.
The fuck is wrong with her?

31:05.531 --> 31:08.134
- A diabetic reaction.
- What, a dia-what?

31:08.167 --> 31:09.335
Diabetic reaction.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.202
What it take to put a fuckin'
candy bar in your pocket?

31:10.236 --> 31:13.005
- Hey.
- You stupid fuckin' dumbass.

31:13.039 --> 31:15.241
- Hey!
- You fuckin' with me?

31:15.274 --> 31:17.376
Don't you talk to me like that.

31:17.409 --> 31:19.912
Don't you raise your fuckin'
voice at me.

31:19.946 --> 31:21.380
You don't think ahead at all.

31:21.413 --> 31:25.184
You think about anybody
other than yourself?

31:42.301 --> 31:45.271
Let's just drop Alexis off at
her house

31:45.304 --> 31:49.408
and I'll help you find the
people that killed Earl.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.945
You don't need to hold us
hostage.

31:52.979 --> 31:55.447
I'll do this with or without
you.

31:59.185 --> 32:00.052
Cool.

32:25.111 --> 32:26.045
Okay, I gotta find the
pip-squeak

32:26.078 --> 32:28.414
who's doing all this
pillaging or I'm fucked.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.549
You understand, I'm totally
fucked.

32:30.582 --> 32:32.318
You fuckin' look at me when
I'm fuckin' talking to you,

32:32.351 --> 32:33.185
you fuckin' understand?

32:33.219 --> 32:34.086
Open your mouth.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.588
Open your fuckin' mouth.

32:36.622 --> 32:40.092
All right, and I don't
give a fuck if this thing

32:40.126 --> 32:44.530
goes down in flames, 'cause
I got nothing to lose.

32:44.563 --> 32:48.334
So you sit there like
a pretty little kitty

32:48.367 --> 32:51.103
and don't cause no fuss

32:51.137 --> 32:53.539
or I'll blow your fuckin'
girlfriend's head off.

32:53.572 --> 32:54.973
You got that?

32:59.511 --> 33:00.412
Stay put.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.149
Come on out, honey.

33:03.182 --> 33:05.217
Come on, let me help you out.

33:05.251 --> 33:06.552
You're going home.

33:32.678 --> 33:33.612
You're gonna help me find

33:33.645 --> 33:37.483
who turned your friend into a
shish kebab.

33:37.516 --> 33:38.550
And when we're done,

33:38.584 --> 33:40.519
I don't want to hear the
name Carter Holmes again.

33:40.552 --> 33:41.553
You got it?

33:43.522 --> 33:47.226
And you're going shut
down all your grow-ops.

33:47.259 --> 33:50.562
They're all done, that was the
last one.

33:53.099 --> 33:54.533
You smoke?

33:54.566 --> 33:55.401
No.

33:55.434 --> 33:57.303
I thought you smoked.

33:57.336 --> 33:58.637
No.

34:00.439 --> 34:04.576
Fuckin' cocksucker, you're
smoking now, you piece of shit.

34:06.612 --> 34:07.579
Don't fuck with me.

34:07.613 --> 34:10.581
Don't you fuck with me,
you be straight with me.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.418
You got a sweet deal here.

34:12.451 --> 34:13.485
You could be in the pen sucking
cocks

34:13.518 --> 34:17.456
and getting fucked up
the ass, you understand?

34:39.911 --> 34:40.512
For the pain.

34:40.545 --> 34:43.149
Let's take a look inside.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.254
Get out of the car.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.469
Door was wide open.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.273
Anybody else you know have a
key?

35:08.740 --> 35:09.641
No.

35:11.477 --> 35:14.680
So what are you
thinking?

35:14.713 --> 35:17.583
Well, you say the door was
wide open,

35:17.616 --> 35:21.720
so obviously someone was let
in unless they picked the lock.

35:23.289 --> 35:24.690
Does anybody other
than Alexis

35:24.723 --> 35:26.625
know about this place?

35:28.294 --> 35:29.195
No.

35:42.408 --> 35:44.510
There, wait, all better.

35:46.712 --> 35:48.614
This here's Earl's phone.

35:48.647 --> 35:51.717
There's only two calls on the
call log,

35:51.750 --> 35:56.655
one of them is yours, do you
recognize this other one?

35:56.688 --> 36:00.459
This call was made four
hours before Earl was killed.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.661
Why don't you dial it up and
see if you recognize the voice

36:02.694 --> 36:04.630
on the other end.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.503
Hi, you have reached
Candy.

36:11.537 --> 36:13.639
Leave me a message and
I'll get back to you.

36:13.672 --> 36:14.573
Thank you.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.710
I just found Earl's phone.

36:18.744 --> 36:22.748
You can give me a call
back at 113-725-7522.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.316
Thank you.

36:24.350 --> 36:25.651
Sound familiar?

36:25.684 --> 36:26.652
No.

36:26.685 --> 36:30.389
You hang on to that
in case they call back.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.760
There's a sushi spot up the
street

36:34.793 --> 36:36.695
that Earl kept going to,
let's check that out first.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.609
Can you take these off?

36:56.448 --> 36:57.449
We are not open yet.

36:57.483 --> 36:59.451
Oh no, it's okay.

36:59.485 --> 37:02.854
We're just looking for a
friend of mine, Earl Freeman.

37:02.888 --> 37:05.591
Black guy with a beard,
comes in here all the time.

37:05.624 --> 37:08.327
Ah, yes, with the beard, Earl.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.262
You seen him lately
at all?

37:10.296 --> 37:12.264
A few days ago.

37:12.298 --> 37:13.765
Was he with anyone?

37:13.799 --> 37:15.301
Just by himself.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.268
Does he usually come in here
alone

37:16.302 --> 37:17.469
or does he come in here with a
girlfriend,

37:17.503 --> 37:19.505
or a friend, or someone?

37:20.472 --> 37:24.543
He always sits there
watching him make sushi, alone.

37:36.755 --> 37:39.658
Another man looks for Earl too.

37:39.691 --> 37:41.360
You have a friend.

37:41.393 --> 37:42.361
What do you mean?

37:42.394 --> 37:43.662
Handyman.

37:43.695 --> 37:46.732
The other day, white guy like
you.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.500
What kind of a handyman?

37:48.534 --> 37:52.070
He came in here asking if
his friend Earl was here,

37:52.103 --> 37:54.373
then tried to fix our fridge.

37:54.406 --> 37:56.642
He said this was dangerous,

37:56.675 --> 38:00.479
said he was a fridge repairman,
handyman.

38:00.512 --> 38:04.383
You notice what kind
of car he was driving?

38:04.416 --> 38:07.686
Color, no?

38:07.719 --> 38:10.722
It's that number from Earl's
phone.

38:10.756 --> 38:11.590
Hello?

38:11.623 --> 38:14.426
- Mm, what is your name?
- Carter, yours?

38:14.460 --> 38:15.394
Candy.

38:15.427 --> 38:18.430
So, he told you the
deal, 200 for one hour,

38:18.464 --> 38:21.633
300 for any fetishes, anything
special.

38:35.381 --> 38:36.782
You go up there,

38:36.815 --> 38:40.419
you tell her you want to set
up a threesome with Earl.

38:40.452 --> 38:42.421
See how she reacts.

38:42.454 --> 38:43.922
Then you fuck her.

38:43.955 --> 38:45.824
Whoa, you want me to bang this
chick?

38:45.857 --> 38:50.696
Handjob, blowjob,
footjob, whatever you like,

38:50.729 --> 38:52.431
so she's convinced of your
veracity.

38:52.464 --> 38:56.602
Then make sure you get her
outside and we'll follow her.

39:01.840 --> 39:02.741
Good dog.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.873
You nervous?

39:36.575 --> 39:37.476
No.

39:39.645 --> 39:43.415
The crazy ones are always
nervous.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.421
When's the last time you saw
Earl?

39:50.722 --> 39:51.890
I don't know.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.727
Let's not talk about Earl.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.630
You have a girlfriend?

40:01.700 --> 40:04.670
When's the last time you saw
him?

40:08.073 --> 40:10.408
Come on, play.

40:12.978 --> 40:17.449
When's the last time you
talked to him on the phone?

40:21.653 --> 40:22.521
Room service.

40:22.554 --> 40:24.422
Get off me.

40:25.524 --> 40:27.526
Room service.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.936
Who the fuck are you?

40:37.969 --> 40:39.771
Where do you live?

41:09.901 --> 41:12.671
I have never been to
your friend's place.

41:12.704 --> 41:14.039
Are you sure?

41:14.072 --> 41:15.641
Yes, I'm sure.

41:19.945 --> 41:23.014
Let me see your immigration
papers.

41:26.017 --> 41:26.885
Come on.

41:28.053 --> 41:30.689
Yeah, go get them.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.065
Look, all I know is
that he was complaining

41:40.098 --> 41:42.868
about a windowless van following
him.

41:42.901 --> 41:44.636
He thought it was a cop.

41:44.670 --> 41:45.904
Following him?

41:49.808 --> 41:50.909
Regina Vesela?

41:52.844 --> 41:54.880
Regina Vesela, that's my
Slovak name.

41:54.913 --> 41:57.983
Regina, with the G, the V, the
vag.

41:59.785 --> 42:00.952
How do you get Candy out of
that?

42:00.986 --> 42:03.555
Where'd the Candy come from?

42:03.589 --> 42:05.757
Where you hiding the candy?

42:08.660 --> 42:11.663
Have you been keeping up your
appointments with immigration?

42:11.697 --> 42:12.598
Yes.

42:12.631 --> 42:14.866
How do I know these aren't
photocopies

42:14.900 --> 42:17.002
of a forged document?

42:17.035 --> 42:17.936
Hey.

42:19.070 --> 42:19.971
Yo, yo!

42:24.009 --> 42:24.910
Yo, yo.

42:27.145 --> 42:28.814
Go get her, tiger.

42:41.827 --> 42:44.630
How long you been seeing Earl
for?

42:44.663 --> 42:46.932
I don't know, about a year.

42:48.867 --> 42:51.569
He only meets me at the hotel.

42:54.640 --> 42:56.141
All I know that he was excited

42:56.174 --> 43:00.211
about getting out of the growing
for good.

43:00.245 --> 43:03.615
He said it was his last crop.

43:03.649 --> 43:06.084
I find out you're lying to me,

43:07.185 --> 43:09.387
I'm going to shake this fat
fuck, I'm gonna come back,

43:09.420 --> 43:10.355
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you

43:10.388 --> 43:13.959
and whoever the fuck you're
working with.

43:16.728 --> 43:17.796
You get that?

43:20.198 --> 43:21.767
Do you get that?

43:23.234 --> 43:24.803
I'm not lying.

43:28.740 --> 43:31.677
Fuck, my neck is so tense.

43:31.710 --> 43:35.080
Need a fuckin' massage
with a happy ending.

43:37.683 --> 43:38.616
It's cheap.

43:39.885 --> 43:41.853
What's the matter, why you so
sad?

43:42.888 --> 43:45.256
So what's the plan now?

43:49.260 --> 43:50.195
The plan.

43:51.863 --> 43:52.764
We watch.

43:53.899 --> 43:54.933
We watch this fleabag hotel

43:54.966 --> 43:58.970
and see if little vaginita's
boyfriend shows up.

43:59.004 --> 44:02.107
He just might be our perp.

44:02.140 --> 44:03.208
Just in time.

44:05.977 --> 44:07.212
Hey, Skeezy.

44:07.245 --> 44:09.214
You wanna get up, you
wanna knock it down?

44:09.247 --> 44:13.819
I'll knock it down, buddy,
gimme two 10 packs, percs.

44:13.852 --> 44:15.887
This your new partner?

44:15.921 --> 44:17.889
Yeah.

44:17.923 --> 44:19.691
- I got some killer Kush.
- Right.

44:19.725 --> 44:21.126
- You a cop?
- Yeah.

44:22.060 --> 44:23.795
You need any weed?

44:23.829 --> 44:24.896
Yeah.

44:24.930 --> 44:25.797
What do you need, man?

44:25.831 --> 44:27.065
I got the killer.

44:30.101 --> 44:31.169
There you go.

44:33.071 --> 44:34.039
See ya.

44:34.072 --> 44:34.973
Hey!

44:36.274 --> 44:38.710
You just gave me one,
motherfucker.

44:38.744 --> 44:39.745
Don't fuck with me.

44:39.778 --> 44:40.712
Oh, yeah, yeah.

44:40.746 --> 44:42.480
No, I'm not fucking with you.

44:42.513 --> 44:46.184
I just, I had it.

44:46.217 --> 44:47.685
See you later.

44:52.791 --> 44:55.326
What happened to your
leg?

44:55.360 --> 44:56.728
What?

44:56.762 --> 44:58.764
What happened to your leg?

44:58.797 --> 45:01.099
I was eating pussy.

45:17.816 --> 45:19.084
You know, all those
plants at Earl's house,

45:19.117 --> 45:20.952
they weren't cut, or pruned, or
dried,

45:20.986 --> 45:23.121
they were just raw plants.

45:24.990 --> 45:26.024
What do you think about me
looking around a little bit,

45:26.057 --> 45:30.328
see if I can find somebody's
trying to sell them?

45:31.797 --> 45:33.231
You got two hours.

45:34.265 --> 45:37.002
I'll meet you back at the boat.

45:53.819 --> 45:54.986
Good
morning, Centennial Hospital.

45:55.020 --> 45:58.089
Hi, do you have an Alexis
Caine in?

45:59.157 --> 46:00.992
She was admitted this morning.

46:01.026 --> 46:03.862
One moment,
sir.

46:04.830 --> 46:06.231
She was released at eleven.

46:06.264 --> 46:07.165
Thanks.

46:10.368 --> 46:12.804
It's Alexis, leave a
message.

46:34.192 --> 46:36.928
Hey, babe, here's your phone.

46:41.199 --> 46:45.036
You heard of anybody robbing
any growers at all lately?

46:45.070 --> 46:45.937
No.

46:51.642 --> 46:53.011
Vietnamese guys that sold you
the store,

46:53.044 --> 46:55.213
any chance they've got
fuckin' surveillance

46:55.246 --> 46:59.184
or something going on on the
street here?

46:59.217 --> 47:00.385
No.

47:00.418 --> 47:03.955
Bikers come by and shake you
down?

47:03.989 --> 47:06.024
- You okay, dude?
- Yeah.

47:07.225 --> 47:09.294
The biggest problem is the
cops.

47:09.327 --> 47:11.930
They surveil people coming
in and out of the store.

47:11.963 --> 47:14.232
I tell them don't park on
the street, park in here,

47:14.265 --> 47:17.435
I got cameras, but they know
better so they park out there

47:17.468 --> 47:20.205
and the cops follow them and
put a magnetic tracking device

47:20.238 --> 47:22.908
under their thing and goodbye.

47:25.243 --> 47:26.077
I've been waiting around for
Earl,

47:26.111 --> 47:26.945
I was supposed to give him this
phone

47:26.978 --> 47:30.381
but I don't know where the fuck
he is.

47:37.155 --> 47:38.156
He's dead.

47:42.260 --> 47:43.128
What?

47:44.029 --> 47:44.996
Ah, Christ.

47:46.397 --> 47:47.298
Oh, dude.

47:52.103 --> 47:53.138
I gotta go.

47:54.439 --> 47:56.107
All right.

48:02.413 --> 48:04.149
- You okay?
- Yeah.

48:05.350 --> 48:06.484
I'm so sorry.

48:11.056 --> 48:13.158
I can't do this anymore.

48:14.292 --> 48:16.227
Can we just go now?
Shh.

48:16.261 --> 48:17.062
Look, I'm packed.

48:17.095 --> 48:20.165
I packed up our shit, we'll just
go.

48:23.301 --> 48:24.502
Let's leave town now.

48:24.535 --> 48:26.371
Come with me, okay?

48:26.404 --> 48:30.008
I gotta find out who killed
Earl

48:30.041 --> 48:32.477
and then we can go.
Yeah?

48:32.510 --> 48:35.113
- Okay?
- I need to feel safe.

48:35.146 --> 48:37.715
- You're safe.
- I don't feel safe.

48:37.748 --> 48:41.152
- Tell me what I can do.
- Leave with me.

48:41.186 --> 48:44.055
I can't, I can't leave.

48:44.089 --> 48:44.990
Not yet.

48:47.358 --> 48:48.493
I can't do this anymore.

48:48.526 --> 48:50.528
I won't do this anymore.

48:53.264 --> 48:54.165
I'm sorry.

49:35.173 --> 49:37.508
I've got a surprise for you.

49:38.543 --> 49:40.511
Recognize those?

49:40.545 --> 49:43.181
I told you the cops had them.

49:44.649 --> 49:49.220
Check this out, so two days
ago, a cop pulls me over,

49:49.254 --> 49:52.390
that's one of the three
cops from Christmas,

49:52.423 --> 49:53.358
tells me that they've been
trying to sell

49:53.391 --> 49:55.493
these three bags on
their own and they can't

49:55.526 --> 49:58.363
'cause it's too heaty or
whatever,

49:58.396 --> 50:01.032
don't have the connections.

50:01.066 --> 50:04.302
So he gives me all this Kush
back,

50:04.335 --> 50:06.804
tells me to sell it and they
want half.

50:06.837 --> 50:10.408
This isn't the cop that
was hunting me down, is it?

50:10.441 --> 50:13.511
No, it's the bald-headed titan
guy.

50:15.180 --> 50:17.448
Your guy's the wandering poet
dude.

50:17.482 --> 50:18.516
Crazy, right?

50:21.419 --> 50:23.121
It's fucking crazy.

50:24.689 --> 50:26.357
Earl was killed.

50:30.461 --> 50:31.229
Some thugs.

50:33.564 --> 50:36.534
I need you to find 105 Kush
plants.

50:39.504 --> 50:41.539
- They killed him?
- Yeah.

50:43.874 --> 50:44.609
Okay.

50:53.884 --> 50:54.585
Hello.

50:54.619 --> 50:55.653
Bernie?

50:55.686 --> 50:57.422
Your hearing is in two days,
Bernie.

50:57.455 --> 50:59.357
It's Tuesday at one o'clock.

50:59.390 --> 51:01.259
I would recommend that
you consult a lawyer

51:01.292 --> 51:02.193
and try not to cowboy this
shit...

Who was at you girl's place in
the van

53:02.613 --> 53:04.249
when I pulled up?

53:10.388 --> 53:12.723
Her husband, her ex-husband.

53:14.459 --> 53:16.594
Are they living together?

53:21.832 --> 53:23.301
No.

53:24.602 --> 53:26.604
Are you sure?

53:29.407 --> 53:30.308
Yeah.

54:43.548 --> 54:46.651
This friend I was talking to
yesterday

54:48.619 --> 54:52.490
was telling me some cops you
might know

54:52.523 --> 54:56.427
stole 106 pounds of Kush
in three hockey bags.

54:57.828 --> 54:58.696
Oh yeah?

54:59.964 --> 55:02.900
He's saying that this guy
Vincent

55:04.569 --> 55:07.104
brought the bags back to him,

55:07.137 --> 55:09.907
wants him to sell the weed for
him.

55:12.410 --> 55:13.378
- Yo.
- Hey.

55:14.579 --> 55:15.713
What the fuck?

55:17.382 --> 55:18.649
What's he doing here?

55:18.683 --> 55:20.385
- Merry Christmas, Zack.
- Yeah, Merry Christmas.

55:20.418 --> 55:21.586
What the fuck is going on?

55:21.619 --> 55:25.456
Open your mouth, open wide,
stay still, open it wide.

55:25.490 --> 55:26.624
Say ah.
Ah.

55:26.657 --> 55:28.959
Say hiya, hiya, hiya,
say it.

55:28.993 --> 55:31.562
- Ha, ha.
- Hiya, hiya, hiya.

55:34.832 --> 55:35.700
Who brought you these bags?

55:35.733 --> 55:36.701
Santa, huh?

55:39.837 --> 55:41.472
Vincent.

55:45.175 --> 55:45.943
Who else?

55:47.011 --> 55:49.914
The young kid with the red
hair.

55:49.947 --> 55:52.583
Anybody else?

55:52.617 --> 55:53.518
I think the black guy was
driving.

55:53.551 --> 55:55.453
See, next time you just
fuckin' tell me.

55:55.486 --> 55:57.422
Don't make me fuckin' ask so
many questions, all right?

55:57.455 --> 55:58.389
When I ask you a question

55:58.423 --> 56:00.791
you give me the fucking
details, all right?

56:00.825 --> 56:02.159
Don't make me ask, and ask, and
ask.

56:02.192 --> 56:03.928
We're part of the team now,
right?

56:03.961 --> 56:06.497
Blow your fucking nuts off.

56:08.833 --> 56:12.169
How's this deal supposed to go
down?

56:12.202 --> 56:14.839
They want 100 grand within the
week.

56:14.872 --> 56:18.609
I'll just call him when
I get all the cash.

56:20.511 --> 56:21.979
I want you to call Vincent.

56:22.012 --> 56:23.948
You got his number, right?

56:23.981 --> 56:26.584
Yeah, I have his number
but he's not fuckin' around.

56:26.617 --> 56:27.652
I need the money.
Okay.

56:27.685 --> 56:30.855
Just pick up your fuckin'
phone and call Vincent.

56:30.888 --> 56:32.490
Tell him you have the money

56:32.523 --> 56:36.393
and you need to see him
right here, right now.

56:37.995 --> 56:39.730
Pick up your phone.

56:43.468 --> 56:47.004
And you find out if he's
got those 105 plants.

56:49.006 --> 56:50.775
Just call him.

56:50.808 --> 56:53.911
Tell him you've got the dough.

56:53.944 --> 56:54.612
That's right.

56:54.645 --> 56:57.848
See, that's working together.

57:04.088 --> 57:05.422
It's Zack.

57:06.624 --> 57:11.061
So, good news, I just sold
the bags, I've got your money.

57:11.095 --> 57:12.162
Where are you?

57:12.196 --> 57:16.701
I'm at the parkade
on Union in Chinatown.

57:17.702 --> 57:18.803
Meet you there.

58:03.648 --> 58:06.817
You got the money in your
pocket, what?

58:07.818 --> 58:09.019
Holy fuck, what?

58:10.655 --> 58:11.421
Fuck, I had a buyer lined up

58:11.455 --> 58:14.925
and he didn't fuckin' pull
through.

58:14.959 --> 58:15.726
- Really?
- I'm sorry.

58:15.760 --> 58:18.896
- Really?
- I'm sorry, Vincent.

58:18.929 --> 58:20.531
I'm gonna meet him a little
later.

58:20.565 --> 58:21.098
Shut up.

58:25.069 --> 58:26.103
Where the fuck does this leave
me?

58:26.136 --> 58:27.772
Now what do I do?

58:29.139 --> 58:32.677
Put your head down there, look
at that.

58:54.999 --> 58:58.335
Yeah, you don't wanna get
Vincent mad.

59:01.906 --> 59:03.007
What happened?

59:04.041 --> 59:05.776
You did good.

59:05.810 --> 59:06.677
Good job.

59:07.945 --> 59:10.047
He doesn't have the plants.

59:10.080 --> 59:12.549
Now he wants all the cash.

59:14.819 --> 59:18.956
All 200 grand and he wants
it in the next 48 hours

59:21.959 --> 59:23.127
or he's gonna stuff me in the
bags

59:23.160 --> 59:26.764
and bury me in some fucking peat
bog.

59:26.797 --> 59:27.632
Oh yeah, the peat bog.

59:27.665 --> 59:31.068
I know that peat bog very, very
well.

59:31.101 --> 59:34.705
You did good, you're on point,
on mission.

59:34.739 --> 59:35.706
Now what you need to do

59:35.740 --> 59:39.610
is find out who's got
those whole Kush plants.

59:39.644 --> 59:41.846
What are you gonna do
with the hockey bags?

59:41.879 --> 59:43.714
We're keeping them.

59:43.748 --> 59:44.715
Collateral.

01:00:11.008 --> 01:00:12.009
I'm sorry.

01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:35.165
You sit on the bags.

01:00:40.237 --> 01:00:42.773
Yo, forget about Vincent.

01:00:48.245 --> 01:00:49.947
Keep your phone on.

01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:07.097
How's it going?
Hey, good.

01:01:07.131 --> 01:01:08.332
The thing you were telling me

01:01:08.365 --> 01:01:12.770
about the cops following people,
did you get a look at them?

01:01:12.803 --> 01:01:14.071
No, the owner of the
restaurant told me.

01:01:14.104 --> 01:01:17.041
Did he say what
they looked like at all?

01:01:17.074 --> 01:01:21.178
Goofy and Donald Duck, how
the fuck am I supposed to know?

01:01:25.783 --> 01:01:28.152
You got a spot to hold on
to a couple of bags for me?

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:30.020
Will you listen to me?

01:01:30.054 --> 01:01:32.222
This is the cops' last
chance to settle old scores.

01:01:32.256 --> 01:01:33.290
Anybody on their shitlist

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:35.059
is gonna get charged or ripped
off.

01:01:35.092 --> 01:01:37.027
So get your girlfriend and
get the fuck out of here

01:01:37.061 --> 01:01:39.897
or you're gonna end up like
Earl.

01:01:41.198 --> 01:01:43.333
Grab one of those.

01:01:43.367 --> 01:01:48.138
This bear trap thing is
coming down on you, brother.

01:01:48.172 --> 01:01:50.941
You should've left town a
year ago like I told you.

01:01:57.114 --> 01:01:59.349
- Yo.
- I've got some good news.

01:01:59.383 --> 01:02:01.185
I sorted it all out.

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:03.087
You got the license.
Oh yeah?

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.789
What's the catch?

01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:08.759
Is that you?

01:02:08.793 --> 01:02:09.493
Is that you out there?

01:02:09.526 --> 01:02:11.862
- No.
- You fuckin' with me?

01:02:11.896 --> 01:02:14.298
What do you mean, am I there?

01:02:29.279 --> 01:02:30.147
Fuck.

01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:45.029
Hey.

01:02:46.931 --> 01:02:48.799
What's your name again?

01:02:48.833 --> 01:02:49.366
Ricardo.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.136
You got any really good weed?

01:02:52.169 --> 01:02:54.138
Really high-end sativa?

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:58.275
No, I just got the heavy
stuff.

01:02:59.844 --> 01:03:00.777
Sativa, no.

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:04.849
But, hey, I got some of this.

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:07.918
Help yourself.

01:03:07.952 --> 01:03:10.387
- Are you sure?
- Sure, go ahead.

01:03:11.922 --> 01:03:13.958
This is good.
All right.

01:03:15.392 --> 01:03:17.427
Hey, do you know of anybody

01:03:17.461 --> 01:03:20.330
trying to unload some full
plants?

01:03:21.899 --> 01:03:24.001
No, that'd be pretty weird,
huh?

01:03:24.034 --> 01:03:25.970
No, I haven't seen any.

01:03:27.204 --> 01:03:28.338
Yeah, weird.

01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:53.864
You know of any grow-ops
being broken into lately?

01:03:53.898 --> 01:03:55.199
Grow-ops being robbed?

01:03:55.232 --> 01:03:59.103
No, I haven't, not
here, not that I know of.

01:04:00.905 --> 01:04:02.172
Frank?

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:12.482
You know, Carter, he's a good
kid.

01:04:12.516 --> 01:04:15.252
I've known him since he was a
little boy.

01:04:15.285 --> 01:04:17.854
He would never hurt anybody.

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:21.258
- Not at all, no.
- No.

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:45.375
I told you not to come here.

01:05:45.409 --> 01:05:47.544
Where the fuck is Mark?

01:05:48.545 --> 01:05:50.247
Where does he live?
Why?

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.315
- Where does he live?
- Why do you need to know?

01:05:51.348 --> 01:05:54.084
Because he just killed Frank.

01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:56.420
You tell him where the spots
are?

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:59.356
You tell him where everything
is?

01:06:00.357 --> 01:06:01.258
Fuck.

01:06:52.276 --> 01:06:56.480
Hey, I want you to cut all
those plants down right now.

01:06:56.513 --> 01:06:58.482
- Wait, what?
- Cut them down!

01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:00.817
I'm gonna call you in two
minutes, okay?

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.386
Shit.

01:07:06.156 --> 01:07:08.625
Hey, it's Mark, the
ex-husband.

01:07:10.094 --> 01:07:12.396
He just killed this friend of
mine, Frank.

01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:13.397
I've got this other warehouse

01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:15.332
and he's on this way down there.

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:17.601
It's at the corner of Brandon
and Hewitt.

01:07:17.634 --> 01:07:19.103
Don't fuck this up.

01:07:19.136 --> 01:07:20.070
Don't do any hotdogging,

01:07:20.104 --> 01:07:23.407
I need this guy in one
piece or I'm fucked.

01:07:37.621 --> 01:07:39.156
Vince?
Yeah.

01:07:39.189 --> 01:07:40.490
The guy who electrocuted Earl
Freeman,

01:07:40.524 --> 01:07:42.492
he just murdered another grower.

01:07:42.526 --> 01:07:44.428
His name is Mark White.

01:07:44.461 --> 01:07:47.331
He's heading over to take down
another warehouse right now

01:07:47.364 --> 01:07:48.665
and I need you to catch him at
it

01:07:48.698 --> 01:07:51.635
and bust his fuckin' ass, okay?

01:07:51.668 --> 01:07:52.702
You got anything real, Bernie?

01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:54.438
Anything real I can use?

01:07:54.471 --> 01:07:55.305
This is legit.

01:07:55.339 --> 01:07:57.174
It is, huh?

01:07:57.207 --> 01:07:58.275
Look, I'm not gonna follow

01:07:58.308 --> 01:08:01.211
one of your fuckin' barnyard
hunches here, all right?

01:08:01.245 --> 01:08:02.512
Do your job, gimme something I
can use,

01:08:02.546 --> 01:08:05.182
I need pictures, something,
Bernie.

01:08:05.215 --> 01:08:06.516
I'm doing you a favor, man.

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:08.485
Listen to me, you
useless fucking cripple,

01:08:08.518 --> 01:08:10.154
you're not doing me any favors,
okay?

01:08:10.187 --> 01:08:11.888
Well, maybe I should take
those three bags of weed

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:12.956
and take them down to Sarge,

01:08:12.989 --> 01:08:15.525
that'd make my life fuckin'
easier, wouldn't it?

01:08:15.559 --> 01:08:16.493
Wouldn't it, huh?

01:08:16.526 --> 01:08:18.562
Bernie, where the
fuck are my hockey bags?

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:21.598
I'll give you the bags
once you bust this guy.

01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:43.279
It's the corner of Brandon
and Hewitt, northeast corner.

01:09:43.313 --> 01:09:45.314
And you got the bags, right,
Bernie?

01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:46.515
'Cause I'll tell you something,

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:48.385
we're not going anywhere unless
you have the fuckin' bags.

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:49.786
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:58.595
Come on, where you at?

01:10:10.474 --> 01:10:12.309
Come on!

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:17.614
You know why they make you wait
a year

01:10:17.647 --> 01:10:21.351
for divorce to go through,
Carter, huh?

01:10:23.487 --> 01:10:27.757
It's 'cause the people
are still usually fucking.

01:10:27.791 --> 01:10:30.427
She's makes a good partner, bro.

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:31.495
I didn't even have to hit the
bitch

01:10:31.528 --> 01:10:34.431
to tell me where the junkie
lived.

01:11:57.847 --> 01:12:00.550
Okay, buddy.

01:12:00.584 --> 01:12:01.485
What, no!

01:12:18.402 --> 01:12:18.935
Fuck!

01:12:21.871 --> 01:12:22.739
Fuck you!

01:12:24.608 --> 01:12:26.342
Gimme a sec here.

01:12:29.446 --> 01:12:31.347
Carter, you fuckin'.

01:12:39.623 --> 01:12:42.626
Fuck you, you fuckin' piece of
shit.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.461
What?

01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:47.631
Hey, you gotta help me, man.

01:12:47.664 --> 01:12:49.666
He's fuckin' crazy, dude.

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:52.402
He's fuckin' trying to kill me,
man.

01:12:52.436 --> 01:12:54.471
Shut up, I'm trying to save
your ass.

01:12:54.504 --> 01:12:57.507
Easy, easy does it, Carter, come
on.

01:12:57.541 --> 01:12:59.609
You gotta help me.

01:12:59.643 --> 01:13:01.945
Carter, listen to me.

01:13:03.547 --> 01:13:04.948
You fuckin' piece...

01:13:08.017 --> 01:13:11.855
Put the gun down!

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:14.390
Put it down.

01:13:15.191 --> 01:13:18.862
Put it down or I'll blow
your fuckin' head off.

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:21.465
What the fuck have you done?

01:13:22.532 --> 01:13:24.601
What do you mean, what
the fuck have I done?

01:13:24.634 --> 01:13:26.436
It's an accident.
That's no accident.

01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:28.037
- Yeah, it's an accident.
- Yeah, right.

01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:30.507
Like my leg in your bear trap.

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:31.708
Bernie, you know I didn't do
that.

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:33.443
It was your grow-op.

01:13:33.477 --> 01:13:36.780
No, it was my grow-op but
it wasn't fuckin' bear traps.

01:13:36.813 --> 01:13:39.549
Put your hands on your head.

01:13:39.583 --> 01:13:40.450
Bernie, this is an
accident.

01:13:40.484 --> 01:13:42.719
- No, no accident.
- He fell into the...

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:44.854
I saw you fuckin' do it.

01:13:52.662 --> 01:13:55.665
Put your fuckin' hands on your
head.

01:13:58.602 --> 01:14:00.003
Don't fuckin' move.

01:14:00.036 --> 01:14:02.539
Don't you fuckin' move.

01:14:02.572 --> 01:14:06.543
Bernie, he was dead when you
got here.

01:14:06.576 --> 01:14:07.443
Shut up.

01:14:08.244 --> 01:14:10.580
Shut up.
You didn't see anything.

01:14:10.614 --> 01:14:11.515
Trust me.

01:14:18.087 --> 01:14:19.856
You never met me.

01:14:20.857 --> 01:14:23.927
You don't know me, you got it?

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:24.861
Bernie, trust me.

01:14:24.894 --> 01:14:27.063
Shut the fuck up.

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:28.765
You don't know me.

01:14:32.536 --> 01:14:34.904
Here's your guy, your grower,
take him.

01:14:34.938 --> 01:14:37.607
The killer's underneath the
panel, he's dead, he's fried.

01:14:37.641 --> 01:14:40.644
I gotta go.
Where are the bags?

01:14:40.677 --> 01:14:41.511
We'll do this later.

01:14:41.545 --> 01:14:42.345
Bernie, where are the fuckin'
bags?

01:14:42.378 --> 01:14:43.880
- Later, we'll do it later!
- Yeah?

01:14:43.913 --> 01:14:46.716
Okay, all right, cut him loose.

01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:47.884
I gotta go!

01:14:49.886 --> 01:14:50.787
Ah man.

01:15:17.781 --> 01:15:19.916
Now, there
were 196 OG Kush plants

01:15:19.949 --> 01:15:22.518
missing from that chop room.

01:15:23.086 --> 01:15:24.554
Do you know what happened to any
of them?

01:15:24.588 --> 01:15:25.955
No.

01:15:25.989 --> 01:15:28.725
You ever seen that
gold Caprice

01:15:28.758 --> 01:15:29.959
cruising around the warehouse?

01:15:29.993 --> 01:15:31.094
No.

01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:34.798
Have you ever seen him
before?

01:15:34.831 --> 01:15:36.099
No.

01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:37.767
So, Mr. Holmes,

01:15:37.801 --> 01:15:40.770
when you showed up at the
warehouse,

01:15:40.804 --> 01:15:41.738
just tell me what happened.

01:15:41.771 --> 01:15:43.106
Take me back through.

01:15:43.139 --> 01:15:44.808
I came through the warehouse,

01:15:44.841 --> 01:15:45.942
I went into the back part of the
room,

01:15:45.975 --> 01:15:48.011
he jumped me from behind,
we got into a fight there.

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:50.780
The fight spilled out into the
main part of the warehouse.

01:15:50.814 --> 01:15:52.982
I didn't know what to do, I went
the door.

01:15:53.016 --> 01:15:57.821
When I went to the door,
your cop was there, yes.

01:15:57.854 --> 01:15:58.822
And then what happened?

01:15:58.855 --> 01:16:00.790
Detective Watts, we
agreed to participate

01:16:00.824 --> 01:16:04.661
in a non-custodial interview,
not an interrogation.

01:16:04.694 --> 01:16:06.596
Now your evidence situates the
deceased

01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:09.599
in two identical robberies.

01:16:09.633 --> 01:16:10.767
My client was lucky enough to
escape

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:14.070
without being another victim
in this string of murders.

01:16:14.103 --> 01:16:16.740
I secured Carter, I cuffed
him.

01:16:16.773 --> 01:16:19.075
And then I discovered Mark
White's body

01:16:19.108 --> 01:16:20.944
lying underneath the electrical
panel.

01:16:20.977 --> 01:16:23.847
It looked like he had been
electrocuted.

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:25.181
An accident?

01:16:25.214 --> 01:16:27.116
As far as I could tell.

01:16:27.150 --> 01:16:30.053
And have you ever seen that
other officer before today?

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:30.987
Never.

01:16:32.956 --> 01:16:34.858
And that detective,
Detective Bernie Coulson,

01:16:34.891 --> 01:16:37.193
you've never seen him before?

01:16:37.226 --> 01:16:40.664
He's already answered the
question.

01:16:43.099 --> 01:16:45.001
Counselor, you got a
minute?

01:16:45.034 --> 01:16:46.102
Hang tight.

01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:54.978
He said you'll be subpoenaed as
a witness

01:16:55.011 --> 01:16:59.048
in Detective Coulson's
murder trial in a few weeks.

01:17:03.152 --> 01:17:05.655
So we got a suspended
detective

01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:07.657
in the middle of a crime scene,

01:17:07.691 --> 01:17:11.761
where 196 OG Kush plants are
missing, and a dead body.

01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:16.800
You know what I think, Bernie?

01:17:16.833 --> 01:17:17.667
I think you didn't accept

01:17:17.701 --> 01:17:20.069
that compensation package for
your leg

01:17:20.103 --> 01:17:21.270
because you wanted to go back to
work

01:17:21.304 --> 01:17:23.072
and you figured you could make
more money

01:17:23.106 --> 01:17:25.742
ripping off the growers

01:17:25.775 --> 01:17:29.245
and that you and Mark White were
partners.

01:17:29.278 --> 01:17:33.282
And that somewhere you've
got those 196 pot plants.

01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:35.118
And not to mention the quarter
million dollars worth of weed

01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:36.920
in them hockey bags.

01:17:38.087 --> 01:17:42.759
Yeah, I don't know if
I should be calling you.

01:17:42.792 --> 01:17:44.828
All right, man, here's the
keys.

01:17:44.861 --> 01:17:48.965
I saw this guy and he
seems really suspicious

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:52.468
and he's loading a bunch of
garbage bags and hockey bags

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:53.770
into his SUV.

01:17:59.876 --> 01:18:00.777
What?

01:18:02.211 --> 01:18:05.248
Well, it smells like marijuana,
yeah.

01:18:13.089 --> 01:18:17.193
He had a shaved head and a
black jacket and a ski hat.

01:18:25.935 --> 01:18:28.704
Yeah, okay, just trying to help.

01:18:35.912 --> 01:18:37.914
Okay, all right, thanks.

01:18:45.822 --> 01:18:47.824
We found the plants
from Frank Becker's grow house

01:18:47.857 --> 01:18:49.125
in Mark's van,

01:18:49.158 --> 01:18:52.862
but we didn't find any of
Carter's weed from the warehouse.

01:19:01.137 --> 01:19:05.041
Mark White was working
alone robbing grow-ops

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:06.943
and then killing the growers.

01:19:06.976 --> 01:19:08.344
The guy's a psychopath.

01:19:18.354 --> 01:19:19.222
When's the last time

01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:22.992
you seen Vincent around the
warehouse?

01:19:23.026 --> 01:19:24.260
Call my lawyer.

01:19:37.974 --> 01:19:42.879
Yeah, Sarge, got the 100
pounds in the hockey bags.

01:19:42.912 --> 01:19:44.881
And we have 196 plants.

01:19:46.315 --> 01:19:48.885
I'm bringing Vincent in now.

01:19:50.086 --> 01:19:52.355
What do you
want to do about Bernie?

01:19:52.388 --> 01:19:54.190
Cut the bear loose.

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:08.437
Here's the license.

01:20:08.471 --> 01:20:10.306
It's good for 200 plants.

01:20:10.339 --> 01:20:11.540
You can fire things up
with the Italian kid.

01:20:11.574 --> 01:20:14.310
If you don't want to do anything
then I'll find someone else

01:20:14.343 --> 01:20:17.046
and take 10%...
This license is useless.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.314
In two weeks the government's
going to announce

01:20:18.347 --> 01:20:20.917
that it's totally legal.

01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:22.818
- Says who?
- Says me.

01:20:23.486 --> 01:20:25.454
I'm working for a pharmaceutical
company

01:20:25.488 --> 01:20:27.223
and training them.

01:20:27.256 --> 01:20:30.193
They're already starting a farm,
it's a government contract.

01:20:30.226 --> 01:20:31.928
So why didn't you tell me
that?

01:20:31.961 --> 01:20:33.196
Because I can't bring you on
board.

01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:34.931
You have to go!

01:20:34.964 --> 01:20:35.464
Don't you get it?

01:20:35.498 --> 01:20:37.000
How have to go.

01:20:39.903 --> 01:20:41.437
You pushed it too far.

01:20:44.941 --> 01:20:47.043
Look, I know this friend in San
Miguel

01:20:47.076 --> 01:20:49.946
and he runs a language school.

01:20:49.979 --> 01:20:52.381
You could teach English.

01:20:52.415 --> 01:20:54.350
You want me to teach?

01:20:58.421 --> 01:21:01.925
I want you to get in that cab
and go.

01:21:03.459 --> 01:21:06.029
I lost fuckin' everything.

01:21:07.997 --> 01:21:11.334
The cops won't let
this slide.

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:12.268
I'm sorry.

01:21:55.044 --> 01:21:57.981
Will you come and visit me?

01:21:58.014 --> 01:21:59.915
Of course.

01:22:05.054 --> 01:22:09.158
Good thing you
taught me how to make tacos.

01:22:13.062 --> 01:22:15.531
Jesus fuckin'
Christ.

01:22:17.066 --> 01:22:19.102
