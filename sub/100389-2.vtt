The captain has some news.

17:56.417 --> 17:58.500
Yeah, you-- you should
probably get down from there.

17:58.583 --> 18:00.583
-Sturdy hands--
-Do you mind? I have a husband.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.959
-Oh! Oh-- I'm here.
-Well, shoot me for caring.

18:05.917 --> 18:07.458
Okay, I just wanted
to let you know

18:07.542 --> 18:10.417
that, uh, I've been running
a few options,

18:10.500 --> 18:13.834
and we think we may have found
a faster way home.

18:13.917 --> 18:17.000
-Is it less than six months?
-Yes, it is.
-BAILEY: Oh!

18:17.083 --> 18:21.291
-(CHEERING)
-No! No! No, no, no, no.

18:21.375 --> 18:23.458
Wait, no.
It's less than three years.

18:23.542 --> 18:24.417
(GROANING)

18:24.500 --> 18:26.583
It could be as little
as six months.

18:27.709 --> 18:28.792
(MATT CLAPS)

18:28.875 --> 18:31.041
-Thanks, Matt.
-We already knew that.

18:31.125 --> 18:34.208
-What?
-Yeah, I told a few people.

18:36.041 --> 18:38.208
Who heard about this from her?

18:39.709 --> 18:40.959
-RYAN: Jesus.
-MATT: Okay, great.

18:41.041 --> 18:45.333
And of those people,
how many of you love fudge?

18:45.417 --> 18:48.000
Just thought it would be good
to think about
something positive.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.375
-RYAN: Okay.
-Captain? Captain, can I...

18:50.458 --> 18:52.458
DEVON:
The captain's a shithouse.

18:52.542 --> 18:54.792
Just a quick word.
So, uh... bit of an update.

18:54.875 --> 18:57.667
The three injured passengers,
no longer injured.

18:57.750 --> 19:00.875
-At last, a bit of good news.
-No, no, no. Um... They're dead.

19:03.083 --> 19:04.792
Probably should have led
with that, Billie.

19:04.875 --> 19:05.959
Right.

19:06.792 --> 19:08.417
Hey, you're not, uh...

19:08.500 --> 19:10.333
getting into some escape pod,
are you?

19:10.417 --> 19:13.792
Ma'am, if I had an escape pod,
I would put you in it.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.709
(QUIETLY) And set
the fucking thing on fire.

19:17.792 --> 19:20.750
-I'm not done with you yet.
-You are very done.

19:20.834 --> 19:23.125
Six months?
Why can't we get six months?

19:23.208 --> 19:25.917
There's more brains
in this room
than a lifetime of sausages.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.375
On it.
Also, the acceleration needs

19:28.458 --> 19:29.542
to be realigned iteratively

19:29.625 --> 19:30.917
or the gravity system
could fail again.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.291
Just say "reset the gravity."

19:32.375 --> 19:34.166
We don't need to make things
sounds cleverer than they are.

19:34.250 --> 19:36.625

-Of course, your highness.

19:43.875 --> 19:45.291
Yes, but I need a new wrist.

19:46.792 --> 19:47.750
Been a long day.

19:47.834 --> 19:49.792
What say we, uh,
grab a drink, let our hair down?

19:49.875 --> 19:51.917
I'm not impressed
by your space career.

20:04.208 --> 20:05.709
RYAN: (IN ENGLISH ACCENT)
Am I disturbing you?

20:05.792 --> 20:07.667
My life is disturbance.

20:07.750 --> 20:09.458
I... just needed a moment.

20:11.417 --> 20:13.125
Not normally one for prayer.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.041
That's not gonna change.

20:16.125 --> 20:18.667
IRIS: How'd it go
telling the passengers
it was six months?

20:19.333 --> 20:20.458
RYAN: Uh... Not great.

20:21.458 --> 20:23.125
They all called me a shithouse.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.792
I'm not surprised.

20:25.875 --> 20:27.792
Seems like we've both
been feeling it.

20:28.959 --> 20:31.000
-If you ever need
a shoulder to--
-Noted.

20:33.959 --> 20:36.500
Well, maybe if I go first,
then...

20:36.583 --> 20:39.667
-you know, it might help you--
-IRIS: My grandfather got me.

20:39.750 --> 20:44.417
The only person I felt
truly myself with, you know?

20:44.500 --> 20:47.709
I was nine years old
when he took me rowing
for the first time.

20:47.792 --> 20:50.375
Just us,
out on the lake together,

20:50.458 --> 20:52.375
peacefully in nature.

20:53.750 --> 20:56.917
Then he had a heart attack
right in front of me and died.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.959
I had to row back to shore
alone,

20:59.041 --> 21:00.458
his lifeless body with me.

21:01.125 --> 21:02.166
RYAN: Oh, my God.

21:03.959 --> 21:05.000
That...

21:06.166 --> 21:09.041
That is terrible.
That is truly, truly awful.

21:09.125 --> 21:13.625
This person I loved,
staring flatly at me...

21:13.709 --> 21:17.250
All I wanted to do was scream
or cry, but I couldn't. I...

21:17.333 --> 21:18.667
just had to keep rowing.

21:19.875 --> 21:22.709
I had to say to myself,
"Pull through, Iris.

21:22.792 --> 21:23.875
Pull through."

21:24.875 --> 21:27.375
IRIS: (SIGHS)
And now it's happening again.

21:28.709 --> 21:30.417
Except this time, I'm not alone.

21:31.709 --> 21:33.291
I'm with you.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.000
Oh, no, wait.
That's not a uniform,

21:35.083 --> 21:37.792
that's a costume because
you're not a real captain,

21:37.875 --> 21:39.875

21:43.208 --> 21:45.917
What's wrong? What's happened?
How bad is it?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.625
Iris was...
uh, was in a rowing boat and--

21:48.709 --> 21:50.959
I just rowed out
and rowed back again.

21:52.291 --> 21:53.291
Hey.

21:54.125 --> 21:56.500
Cool. So, coffins.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.500

21:58.583 --> 21:59.875

I think we passed appropriate

22:02.583 --> 22:03.667
I mean, they're light.

22:03.750 --> 22:06.041
A compressed jet of air
will fire them out of orbit.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.625
Unseemly, yet practical.

-Good job.
-Thanks.

22:08.834 --> 22:10.583
How are you doing, Billie?

22:10.667 --> 22:12.000
-Uh... I'm fine.
-Yeah?

22:12.083 --> 22:14.166
'Cause you have gone above

22:14.250 --> 22:15.375
It's not a problem. It's fine.

I'm happy to hear any concerns,
is what I'm saying.

22:18.709 --> 22:20.417
Well, um...

-Uh-huh.

22:23.041 --> 22:25.458

as a captain

22:25.542 --> 22:26.959

of getting old.

-Right.

to talk to those passengers,

22:37.208 --> 22:39.041

he starts flinging his shit

22:46.750 --> 22:48.583

to go fuck themselves.

22:48.667 --> 22:51.875
I mean, he is like-- You know,
the best analogy I can think of

22:51.959 --> 22:54.083
is he's like an idiot
in charge of a spaceship,

22:54.166 --> 22:57.041
but that is not an analogy,
that is just a fact.

22:57.125 --> 22:59.709

Wait-- Wait a minute.
Judd said what to NASA?

into a freezer

the whole thing out.

a hand and you shat in it.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.625
You wanna just take me through
the thought process there?

up against NASA's,

a bit fucking short.
