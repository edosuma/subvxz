Good morning,
Breakfast Princesses.

00:46.446 --> 00:48.608
Mmm!

00:50.650 --> 00:52.312
Oh.

00:52.385 --> 00:53.478
Huh?!

00:53.553 --> 00:55.886
Oh.

00:55.955 --> 00:58.754
Sis, give me the phone.

01:01.027 --> 01:01.892
Oh, hey, Finn.

01:01.961 --> 01:04.328
I've got another Ice
King situation here.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.524
Oh, yeah?

01:05.598 --> 01:06.793
That would be great.

01:06.866 --> 01:09.131
Thanks.

01:10.270 --> 01:11.431
Ice King!

01:11.504 --> 01:12.938
How many times
have we warned you

01:13.006 --> 01:14.474
about using love potion?

01:14.541 --> 01:16.567
That's why I'm using honey.

01:16.643 --> 01:18.305
Man, who cares if it's honey?

01:18.378 --> 01:20.040
You stink anyways.

01:21.147 --> 01:22.274
Yeah, you stink so much,

01:22.348 --> 01:23.816
I'm gonna ground you for a week.

01:23.883 --> 01:25.977
What?! You can't do that!

01:26.052 --> 01:27.850
You're grounded for two weeks!

01:27.921 --> 01:30.083
<i>You're</i> grounded for two weeks!

01:30.156 --> 01:31.988
Three weeks.

01:32.058 --> 01:33.321
Oh, snaps!

01:33.393 --> 01:36.022
Why?! I didn't do anything!

01:36.096 --> 01:37.792
Four weeks?

01:40.033 --> 01:41.194
Fine!

01:41.267 --> 01:43.463
But I'm only gonna
do it for a week!

01:43.536 --> 01:46.005
That just grounded
you for four weeks.

01:46.072 --> 01:47.631
Oh, dang!

01:48.975 --> 01:50.637
Okay.

01:54.013 --> 01:56.175
What's up with the peace sign?!

01:56.249 --> 01:58.616
Oh. No, I-I was just
trying to show you

01:58.685 --> 02:01.519
how many weeks you got.

02:01.588 --> 02:03.682
Get out of here, bubble butt!

02:07.193 --> 02:08.923
Awesome.

02:08.995 --> 02:10.895
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

02:10.964 --> 02:12.899
This is so unfair!

02:12.966 --> 02:15.333
<i>They're</i> the ones who should
be grounded, not me!

02:15.401 --> 02:16.562
Ooh!

02:16.636 --> 02:20.505
I'm so mad I could
just hit them!

02:20.573 --> 02:24.943
If only I could hit them
without leaving the castle.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.508
"H... I... T...

02:31.584 --> 02:33.815
M... A... N..."

02:33.887 --> 02:36.186
Ooh!

02:36.256 --> 02:37.087
Perfect.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.592
"Dear, Mr. Scorcher.

02:39.659 --> 02:42.151
I would like you
to hit two people.

02:42.228 --> 02:43.821
Neat name, by the way.

02:43.897 --> 02:44.897
Love, the Ice King."

02:47.100 --> 02:50.036
Aah!

02:50.103 --> 02:51.103
Whoa, you are fast!

02:53.673 --> 02:56.268
And quiet.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.777
And very good at
dramatic silence.

02:58.845 --> 02:59.778
I like it.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.714
All right! So, how
do we do this?

03:02.782 --> 03:05.081
Uh, we shake hands, or... aah!

03:07.687 --> 03:09.280
Oh-ho!

03:09.355 --> 03:11.051
Paperwork.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.052
"Finn and Jake."

03:21.167 --> 03:22.897
Whoosh!

03:27.207 --> 03:29.574
Aha. There he is.

03:29.642 --> 03:31.702
Huh? What's he doing?

03:33.046 --> 03:34.105
What the...

03:34.180 --> 03:37.275
I hired a hitman, not a fireman!

03:39.419 --> 03:41.911
Dude, you see my masterpiece
coming together, right?

03:41.988 --> 03:43.422
Mine's whack.

03:43.489 --> 03:45.481
Well, put some meat in there.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.288
Huh. What kind of meat is that?

03:47.360 --> 03:49.124
That's Meat Man's meat.

03:49.195 --> 03:50.493
Do you think it hurts Meat Man

03:50.563 --> 03:51.690
when he gives us his meat?

03:51.764 --> 03:54.757
I don't know. I can't
read his mind.

03:54.834 --> 03:57.929
Phoo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

03:58.004 --> 04:00.473
No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

04:00.540 --> 04:02.304
You guys, I...

04:02.375 --> 04:03.934
What do you think
"grounded" means?!

04:04.010 --> 04:06.138
It's wasted, man!

04:06.212 --> 04:07.407
Oh, great!

04:07.480 --> 04:08.948
Now see what you
did to my buddy?!

04:09.015 --> 04:10.176
So help me, Ice King!

04:10.250 --> 04:12.845
Okay, okay. Ghal!

04:13.987 --> 04:15.216
It's all right, buddy.

04:15.288 --> 04:17.257
We can make another.

04:17.322 --> 04:19.291
Sheesh, this Scorcher guy's got

04:19.358 --> 04:22.796
some weird ideas about hitting.

04:22.862 --> 04:24.956
Hey, there you are.

04:25.031 --> 04:26.391
What's that? I
already signed that.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.097
I thought I told
you to <i>hit</i> them,

04:29.168 --> 04:31.660
not burn them alive,
you big dummy!

04:31.738 --> 04:32.933
Ghal!

04:33.006 --> 04:34.998
It's almost like you
want to kill them!

04:35.074 --> 04:37.669
Lucky for them, I
stopped the fire.

04:37.744 --> 04:40.145
You know what happens when
you're burned alive?!

04:40.213 --> 04:42.773
Your eyeballs explode! Blah!

04:42.849 --> 04:44.112
Hey, wha?

04:47.020 --> 04:49.012
Punch, punch.

04:49.088 --> 04:50.989
Punch.

04:51.057 --> 04:52.787
Rainicorn, don't eat him.

05:05.905 --> 05:09.000
Ice winds, blow!

05:09.075 --> 05:11.306
Blo-o-o-o-o-o-o-w!

05:11.377 --> 05:13.107
Blo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-w!

05:13.179 --> 05:14.670
Meat Man...

05:16.482 --> 05:18.280
Meat Man, I'm sorry, Meat Man.

05:18.351 --> 05:20.081
I-I didn't mean it, man.

05:23.289 --> 05:26.817
Finn and Jake, I
am just a dream!

05:26.893 --> 05:30.694
I was never here.

05:30.763 --> 05:34.894
Okay, mister, you are
really trying my patience!

05:34.967 --> 05:37.061
How clear can I be?!

05:37.136 --> 05:39.901
All I want you to
do is <i>hit</i> them...

05:39.972 --> 05:42.100
On the shoulder, or something.

05:43.309 --> 05:45.278
Are you even listening?

05:45.345 --> 05:46.779
Oh, I get it.

05:46.846 --> 05:50.374
Here's double the grease
to <i>not</i> kill Finn and Jake.

05:52.652 --> 05:54.245
You trying to hustle
me, Scorcher?

05:54.320 --> 05:56.414
Okay. I'll play this game.

05:56.489 --> 05:58.924
How about this prize
piece for your pad?

05:58.991 --> 06:01.392
♪ I wanna live, live, live ♪

06:01.461 --> 06:02.588
♪ I wanna live, live, live ♪

06:02.662 --> 06:04.460
No-o-o-o-o-o-o!

06:04.530 --> 06:05.930
Huh. Okay.

06:05.998 --> 06:07.466
How about these bad boys...

06:07.533 --> 06:09.161
Night vision x-ray goggles

06:09.235 --> 06:12.137
for when you have a
lady houseguest?

06:12.205 --> 06:13.867
Aw! Come on!

06:13.940 --> 06:16.432
At least renegotiate the target!

06:16.509 --> 06:19.570
You can destroy my least
favorite princesses.

06:19.645 --> 06:21.443
What about Lumpy Space Princess?

06:22.415 --> 06:23.610
Ghost Princess?

06:23.683 --> 06:25.413
I can't even hold her
with my love mitts.

06:25.485 --> 06:26.485
Aw, geez!

06:26.519 --> 06:27.418
Uh...

06:27.487 --> 06:29.479
Huh.

06:29.555 --> 06:30.818
Oh!

06:30.890 --> 06:33.485
A-A leg cramp, in my leg!

06:33.559 --> 06:35.050
Ow, ow!

06:35.128 --> 06:36.687
O-Oh, this is so embarrassing.

06:36.763 --> 06:38.425
I'll be right back.

06:38.498 --> 06:40.057
Ow! Ow!

06:42.702 --> 06:44.728
Think, baby. Come on.

06:44.804 --> 06:46.500
Ah!

06:46.572 --> 06:50.532
All right, let's hit
the hitman, right?

06:50.610 --> 06:52.943
There's got to be a...

06:53.012 --> 06:53.945
Ah!

06:54.013 --> 06:58.610
"Blastronaut... ♪1 solution
for all hitman problems."

06:58.684 --> 07:00.710
Sheesh! $99.95?!

07:00.787 --> 07:02.312
That's nuts!

07:04.290 --> 07:07.419
"Scor... cher."

07:12.098 --> 07:14.795
Sweet!

07:21.007 --> 07:22.007
No!

07:22.074 --> 07:25.101
Come back, you wussy!

07:25.178 --> 07:26.942
Ooh, that was weird.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.439
Was that your friend,
or something?

07:32.118 --> 07:35.213
Look! A supermodel!

07:35.288 --> 07:36.847
Look! A hoverboard!

07:36.923 --> 07:39.791
Look! The apocalypse!

07:39.859 --> 07:44.024
Someone got hit in
the boingloings.

07:44.096 --> 07:45.530
Hit in the boingloings!

07:45.598 --> 07:48.625
Boingloings! Boingloings!

07:48.701 --> 07:50.795
Somebody got hit in them.

07:50.870 --> 07:53.203
Peace out!

07:54.941 --> 07:56.341
Oh!

07:56.409 --> 07:57.649
Freakin' butt! Butt, butt, butt!

08:01.380 --> 08:03.975
Hey, Finn, are you awake yet?

08:04.050 --> 08:06.679
I'm trying.

08:06.752 --> 08:08.550
I had a dream about Meat Man.

08:08.621 --> 08:09.816
Oh, yeah?

08:09.889 --> 08:11.949
I think I'm gonna
stop eating Meat Man.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.549
Aah! Oh!

08:13.626 --> 08:14.889
You're grounded!

08:14.961 --> 08:16.589
I know, but shush!

08:22.602 --> 08:23.865
Okay.

08:23.936 --> 08:25.837
I hired a guy to kill
you by accident.

08:25.905 --> 08:26.736
What?!

08:26.806 --> 08:28.517
I thought he was gonna
just hit you in the gut

08:28.541 --> 08:31.340
and make you spit up your lunch.

08:31.410 --> 08:33.811
Well, I froze him in ice,

08:33.880 --> 08:35.280
but I think he's free now,

08:35.347 --> 08:36.976
'cause he's made out of fire...

08:37.049 --> 08:40.076
or he commands fire, maybe?

08:40.152 --> 08:43.020
Good job. Good
job, The Ice King.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.628
Oh, my life!

08:49.695 --> 08:51.288
Aah!

08:51.364 --> 08:52.423
Hyah!

08:52.498 --> 08:55.935
Come on, man! Let's
get out of here!

08:59.505 --> 09:01.974
Jake, do something!
He's getting close!

09:02.041 --> 09:04.670
Yah!

09:06.979 --> 09:09.073
Go faster, man!

09:10.716 --> 09:11.716
Oof!

09:17.023 --> 09:18.651
You alive?

09:18.724 --> 09:20.989
Uh, I think so.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.256
Whew! That was close!

09:29.435 --> 09:31.063
Uh, hey, guys?

09:31.137 --> 09:33.663
I don't think this ice
dome is gonna last long.

09:33.739 --> 09:34.798
What do we do?

09:34.874 --> 09:37.469
Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hm.

09:37.543 --> 09:39.637
Ooh! Got it! I'm
gonna kill you guys.

09:39.712 --> 09:41.442
Hey, I'll kill <i>you!</i>

09:41.514 --> 09:43.005
No, wait a minute, you two!

09:43.082 --> 09:45.017
I won't actually kill you.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.916
I'm just gonna lower
your body temperatures

09:46.986 --> 09:49.251
so you seem dead.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.621
And after we fool
that fool outside,

09:51.691 --> 09:53.660
I'll warm you up... good as new.

09:53.726 --> 09:55.251
No way, man!

09:55.328 --> 09:57.559
You already messed
up enough stuff!

09:57.630 --> 09:59.064
You'll probably kill us, too!

09:59.131 --> 10:02.863
Yeah! We don't trust you!

10:02.935 --> 10:04.130
Zap!

10:05.338 --> 10:06.338
You'll thank me later.

10:08.541 --> 10:09.668
Stop!

10:09.742 --> 10:11.734
Time out!

10:11.811 --> 10:14.747
You don't need to
do this anymore!

10:14.814 --> 10:17.181
Look! They're dead!

10:17.249 --> 10:19.582
I killed them myself!

10:19.652 --> 10:22.053
Dead, dead, dead!

10:22.121 --> 10:24.420
Dead, dead, dead!

10:24.490 --> 10:27.585
They're dead. No pulses.

10:36.268 --> 10:39.966
So, uh, looks like
you can go home now.

10:40.039 --> 10:42.099
Aah!

10:42.174 --> 10:44.200
Oh, yeah. O-Of course.

10:44.276 --> 10:46.108
There.

10:53.886 --> 10:56.151
Oh, glad all that's over.

11:05.965 --> 11:07.957
Hey, guys, guess what.

11:08.034 --> 11:10.799
You're grounded...
