00:05.651 --> 00:07.408
Help! Please help me!

00:09.161 --> 00:10.528
Please help me!

00:10.595 --> 00:12.161
Help! Please,

00:12.227 --> 00:13.795
Help me!

00:38.895 --> 00:41.995
The city of Miami has been
gripped with a local news story,

00:42.062 --> 00:45.528
First reported here on WETX
yesterday afternoon.

00:45.595 --> 00:48.361
The victim: innocent;
the crime: shocking.

00:48.428 --> 00:50.561
And all of it caught on tape.

00:50.628 --> 00:52.628
Local college student
Sherry Williamson

00:52.695 --> 00:54.895
Was brutally carjacked
early yesterday morning.

00:54.962 --> 00:58.094
A nearby security camera,
the only witness.

00:58.161 --> 01:00.962
With us, we have special
correspondent Ryan Wolfe,

01:01.028 --> 01:03.261
Former CSI
with the Miami-Dade

01:03.328 --> 01:05.161
Crime Lab. Welcome, Ryan.

01:05.227 --> 01:06.461
Thank you, Heather.

01:06.528 --> 01:07.828
It's nice to be here again.

01:07.895 --> 01:10.261
Now, the unnamed suspect
is still at large.

01:10.328 --> 01:12.494
What can your forensic
background tell us

01:12.561 --> 01:14.261
About the scene
of the crime?

01:14.328 --> 01:16.062
Okay, uh, well,

01:16.127 --> 01:18.028
You see, the average
person would look

01:18.094 --> 01:20.062
At the center
of the action,

01:20.127 --> 01:21.494
But as a CSI, I'm trained

01:21.561 --> 01:23.494
To look from the outside,
and work inward.

01:23.561 --> 01:25.327
Now, if we focus

01:25.394 --> 01:27.628
Here on the
attacker...

01:27.695 --> 01:29.761
we're never going
to see his face.

01:29.828 --> 01:33.361
So, we have to, uh, analyze
the environment around him.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.327
Okay, right here.

01:37.394 --> 01:40.494
If we isolate this image,
and then we magnify it,

01:40.561 --> 01:43.294
And then we
enhance it...

01:46.761 --> 01:49.494
...you'll see the attacker's
identity clear as day.

01:51.561 --> 01:53.028
If anyone has information

01:53.095 --> 01:54.761
Regarding this man's
whereabouts,

01:54.828 --> 01:58.861
Please call the station's
hotline at 555-0111.

02:37.795 --> 02:39.227
It's quite
a crowd, Frank.

02:39.294 --> 02:41.227
Yeah, word
spread fast.

02:41.294 --> 02:43.028
Everybody clamoring
to sneak a peek

02:43.095 --> 02:44.695
At public enemy #1.

02:44.761 --> 02:46.428
Carjacker.

02:46.494 --> 02:47.828
Yeah.

02:47.895 --> 02:50.028
Whose face Ryan plastered
all over television

02:50.095 --> 02:51.461
About an hour ago.

02:57.661 --> 02:59.761
Did we get a name?

02:59.828 --> 03:01.095
No.

03:01.162 --> 03:03.128
No ID, and
nobody's talking.

03:03.194 --> 03:04.461
City on the hunt.

03:04.528 --> 03:07.162
Looks like
vigilantes took it

03:07.227 --> 03:09.327
Upon themselves
to be the guy's judge and jury.

03:09.394 --> 03:11.761
Judge, jury

03:11.828 --> 03:13.828
And executioner.

04:20.411 --> 04:23.111
Is it just me, or have people
gotten a little too casual

04:23.177 --> 04:25.177
About seeing a dead body?

04:31.077 --> 04:33.511
Easier when decomp's
at a distance.

04:33.578 --> 04:35.578
Believe me.

04:43.878 --> 04:46.711
We've got at least
a dozens footprints here.

04:46.778 --> 04:48.545
If an angry mob got to him,

04:48.611 --> 04:50.645
That would explain
our boy's injuries.

04:50.711 --> 04:52.545
Ligature mark on his ankle,

04:52.611 --> 04:54.878
Possibly held in restraint.

04:54.945 --> 04:57.578
Baby boy didn't go down quietly.

04:57.645 --> 05:01.211
Bruising, lacerations.

05:01.278 --> 05:04.878
Fingernails
on both hands are torn.

05:05.978 --> 05:07.912
Wait a minute.

05:07.978 --> 05:10.878
Is that something
under the nail bed?

05:12.111 --> 05:16.311
It's like a wood splinter.

05:16.378 --> 05:18.711
It's going to be impossible
to process this scene.

05:18.778 --> 05:20.077
People have
contaminated it.

05:20.144 --> 05:22.745
Someone also contaminated
the body.

05:22.811 --> 05:24.620
Smell's unmistakable.
It's urine.

05:25.099 --> 05:26.865
It's not just enough
to kill somebody.

05:26.932 --> 05:28.898
You've got to make a statement.

05:28.965 --> 05:32.731
Media blew this carjacking
way out of proportion.

05:32.798 --> 05:34.499
Maybe Ryan fueled the fire.

05:34.566 --> 05:36.065
He didn't just fuel the fire.

05:36.132 --> 05:38.432
He lit the match.

05:43.136 --> 05:45.070
Miss Williamson...

05:45.881 --> 05:47.623
Miss Williamson,
I know this is difficult,

05:47.658 --> 05:49.424
But can you tell me

05:49.491 --> 05:51.824
If that's the man that hurt you?

05:51.890 --> 05:54.091
Yes, that's m.

05:54.157 --> 05:55.690
What happened?

05:55.757 --> 05:58.723
I just left the bank
and was going to my car.

05:58.790 --> 06:01.558
He came out of nowhere.

06:01.623 --> 06:02.990
Hey, how you doing? Hey.

06:03.057 --> 06:04.224
Hey!

06:06.057 --> 06:08.657
Help, please! Help me!

06:08.723 --> 06:10.458
Did he have a weapon?

06:10.524 --> 06:13.324
No.

06:13.391 --> 06:15.424
Guess he really
didn't need one.

06:20.890 --> 06:24.657
Now he's dead.

06:24.723 --> 06:28.191
I can't help
but feel responsible.

06:28.257 --> 06:30.291
Why do you say that?

06:30.357 --> 06:32.558
All the craziness
this caused.

06:32.623 --> 06:35.291
Yes, I wanted
justice, but...

06:35.357 --> 06:39.424
not like that.

06:39.491 --> 06:41.491
I understand.

06:43.357 --> 06:45.458
Stand by. 15 minutes to air.

06:45.524 --> 06:47.458
All remaining talent
to the set, please.

06:47.524 --> 06:48.590
Cameras to your places...

06:48.657 --> 06:51.157
Hey.

06:51.224 --> 06:53.057
How's it going?

06:53.124 --> 06:54.357
Thanks for
coming down.

06:54.424 --> 06:55.990
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

06:56.057 --> 06:57.191
You look different.

06:57.257 --> 06:58.723
Must be the eyeliner.

06:58.790 --> 07:00.391
I wear makeup now.

07:02.458 --> 07:05.224
You must think it's
pretty, uh, pretty silly.

07:05.291 --> 07:08.191
No, that wasn't the adjective
I was looking for.

07:12.824 --> 07:14.824
Well, I got to
earn a living.

07:16.124 --> 07:17.357
So, congratulations.

07:17.424 --> 07:18.690
I heard you found
the carjacker.

07:18.757 --> 07:20.623
Is that why
you called me down here?

07:20.690 --> 07:22.723
To ease your conscience?

07:22.790 --> 07:25.057
You know, you may have gotten
a man killed today.

07:25.124 --> 07:27.924
I didn't really think
it would go that far.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.424
Well, that seems
to be a pattern with you.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.824
Okay, so this about the, uh,
it's about the gambling...?

07:32.890 --> 07:33.990
It's about
everything, Ryan.

07:34.057 --> 07:35.291
You assaulted a police officer.

07:35.357 --> 07:36.890
You leaked information
to Erica Sikes.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.824
Okay, well, all
that is done now.

07:38.890 --> 07:40.757
Not doing it
anymore.

07:40.824 --> 07:44.291
Are you not doing it in the way that you
burned the counterfeit money never bet again?

07:48.324 --> 07:50.258
Doesn't this job
ever get to you?

07:50.324 --> 07:53.490
I needed an outlet.

07:53.557 --> 07:55.557
I wasn't
hurting anyone.

07:55.624 --> 07:57.324
Really?

07:57.390 --> 08:00.157
You were being blackmailed
by a suspect

08:00.224 --> 08:02.291
Who you owed money to.

08:02.358 --> 08:03.957
And I paid him
that money

08:04.024 --> 08:05.423
So that he wouldn't
have any power

08:05.490 --> 08:07.291
Over the investigation
that I was a part of.

08:07.358 --> 08:09.790
You gambled on the clock
so that you could pay him back.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.457
And I did it
in a card club.

08:11.523 --> 08:12.790
And I wasn't
breaking any laws.

08:12.857 --> 08:14.490
You broke all the rules.

08:14.557 --> 08:17.490
And because you have, every case
you have ever worked on

08:17.557 --> 08:18.924
Is being called
into question,

08:18.991 --> 08:20.790
So if you say that
you weren't hurting anyone,

08:20.857 --> 08:22.957
Think about all
of the people left behind

08:23.024 --> 08:24.590
To pick up the pieces for you.

08:24.657 --> 08:26.657
Speaking of which,
I'm needed in DNA.

08:26.724 --> 08:27.957
I have to go.
Wait a second. Wait.

08:28.024 --> 08:30.490
Just wait a second.

08:40.224 --> 08:42.157
After my
segment ran,

08:42.224 --> 08:44.258
The station received
a lot of phone calls-

08:44.324 --> 08:45.957
Including about a
dozen death threats-

08:46.024 --> 08:47.690
To the carjacker.

08:49.924 --> 08:51.490
These are the, uh,
names and numbers.

08:51.557 --> 08:53.557
Hopefully, one of
them is your guy.

09:10.957 --> 09:12.690
CAINE:
Are you familiar

09:12.757 --> 09:15.024
With the South Pointe
area, Mr. Hewitt?

09:15.091 --> 09:17.757
Yeah. Yeah, that's where
they found that guy.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.690
The carjacker, right?

09:19.757 --> 09:21.857
The carjacker you threatened.

09:23.291 --> 09:27.291
And we found your DNA
on his clothes.

09:28.324 --> 09:30.790
It was nice work, and quick.

09:30.857 --> 09:33.157
I'm a fan
of law enforcement, you know?

09:33.224 --> 09:34.824
Yes.

09:34.891 --> 09:37.423
But you don't believe
in the law, do you? I do.

09:37.490 --> 09:40.557
But sometimes you-You got to
take things into your own hands.

09:47.091 --> 09:49.924
I saw the carjacker on the beach
in the morning.

09:49.991 --> 09:52.624
Recognized him from the news.

09:52.690 --> 09:54.690
Did to him what he did
to that poor girl.

09:54.757 --> 09:56.124
With a little interest.

10:06.091 --> 10:09.358
Come on. Step outside
the badge a second.

10:09.423 --> 10:11.124
You got to admit.

10:11.191 --> 10:13.291
Streets are much safer
without this guy on them.

10:13.358 --> 10:14.924
That's not up to you.

10:18.891 --> 10:20.991
Sir, were you brought in
for questioning?

10:21.057 --> 10:22.957
Are you a suspect?
I'm not a suspect.

10:23.024 --> 10:24.590
I did it.
I killed the carjacker.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.824
Is there anything else
you'd like to say?

10:26.891 --> 10:29.124
You bet. People of Miami,
we can take back our city.

10:29.191 --> 10:30.490
Make it safe
for our families.

10:30.557 --> 10:31.957
So you admit it?
You are a vigilante?

10:32.024 --> 10:33.291
You can call me
whatever you want.

10:33.358 --> 10:35.224
I'm just a concerned citizen.

10:35.291 --> 10:37.824
Let's take back our city!

10:37.891 --> 10:39.824
Take it back!

10:46.824 --> 10:48.057
Excuse me,
Officer?

10:48.124 --> 10:49.857
Is that him?

10:51.624 --> 10:52.924
The guy who killed
my brother?

10:52.991 --> 10:55.657
Your brother?

10:55.724 --> 10:57.191
I'm sorry,

10:57.258 --> 10:59.490
But I'm not at liberty
to discuss an open case.

10:59.557 --> 11:01.258
Came as soon as I heard.

11:01.324 --> 11:02.423
I still can't believe it.

11:02.490 --> 11:03.724
What's your brother's name?

11:03.790 --> 11:05.824
Jason.

11:05.891 --> 11:07.757
Jason Billings.

11:07.824 --> 11:10.024
I just saw his picture
on the news.

11:10.091 --> 11:12.624
Think you would feel comfortable

11:12.690 --> 11:14.924
Identifying his body for us?

11:14.991 --> 11:18.957
Sure. Whatever you need.

11:19.024 --> 11:20.324
Okay.

11:22.091 --> 11:23.258
You heard it live.

11:23.324 --> 11:24.891
Derek Hewitt, a mechanic
from Homestead,

11:24.957 --> 11:28.224
Has confessed to the murder
of a still unnamed suspect

11:28.291 --> 11:29.657
Who was caught on video

11:29.724 --> 11:31.457
Assaulting young
Sherry Williamson

11:31.523 --> 11:32.957
In broad daylight yesterday.

11:33.024 --> 11:36.124
Hewitt, a self-Described
vigilante, urged others

11:36.191 --> 11:39.490
To "take back the city"
by any means necessary.

11:39.557 --> 11:41.057
H, Natalia called.

11:41.124 --> 11:43.057
She spoke
to the victim's brother.

11:43.124 --> 11:45.557
And we got a positive ID on him.
It's Jason Billings.

11:45.624 --> 11:47.523
Did you get a
cause of death?

11:47.590 --> 11:49.258
Yes. It's a Jefferson fracture.

11:49.324 --> 11:51.557
Vertical force
to cause a broken neck.

11:51.624 --> 11:53.957
Check out these photos
Alexx sent over.

11:54.024 --> 11:56.258
She documented all the
injuries he sustained.

11:56.324 --> 11:58.523
Several to his rib cage
were postmortem.

11:58.590 --> 12:00.724
And then there's this.

12:02.757 --> 12:03.757
That looks like
a shark bite.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.390
Yeah, also postmortem.

12:13.224 --> 12:15.291
So if Jason was already dead
when he was bitten,

12:15.358 --> 12:16.924
That means he died
out on the water

12:16.991 --> 12:18.690
And then somehow made it
back to shore.

12:18.757 --> 12:21.423
Before he was ID'd
on the news.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.991
Yeah, before Ryan
broadcast his face.

12:24.057 --> 12:26.624
So our vigilante didn't kill
the carjacker.

12:26.690 --> 12:27.991
He just wanted the credit.

12:27.992 --> 12:29.992
So if he did not kill him 
 who did?

12:43.101 --> 12:44.635
DUQUESNE:
Well, I mean...

12:45.701 --> 12:48.034
Wednesday.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.167
Yeah.

12:49.234 --> 12:50.401
I don't know.

12:50.468 --> 12:53.568
I mean, in all honesty,
I've been...

12:53.635 --> 12:55.034
Mm-Hmm.

12:55.101 --> 12:56.767
Bye.

12:57.900 --> 12:59.368
Hey.

12:59.434 --> 13:00.900
Great to see that smile.

13:00.967 --> 13:02.900
It's nothing.

13:02.967 --> 13:04.001
Who was that? Jake?

13:04.067 --> 13:07.268
Um, yeah, I
told him that

13:07.334 --> 13:08.568
If people would stop
killing each other,

13:08.635 --> 13:09.934
We could have
a proper meal.

13:10.001 --> 13:11.735
Is that info
on the carjacker?

13:11.800 --> 13:12.800
Yeah.

13:12.867 --> 13:14.134
Guy's name is Jason Billings.

13:14.201 --> 13:15.268
Born into money.

13:15.334 --> 13:16.501
He had some pretty
expensive hobbies.

13:16.568 --> 13:17.800
Like what?

13:17.867 --> 13:20.301
Like racing anything
he can get his hands on.

13:20.368 --> 13:22.301
Horses, cars, boats.

13:22.368 --> 13:24.635
Why would a guy with
that much money to burn

13:24.701 --> 13:25.967
Need to steal a car?

13:26.034 --> 13:27.568
Had to be out of desperation.

13:27.635 --> 13:30.601
We need to find out
where Jason docked his boat.

13:36.334 --> 13:38.334
Miami-Dade PD.

13:39.967 --> 13:42.101
Is this Jason Billings' boat?

13:42.167 --> 13:43.834
Yes, it is.

13:43.900 --> 13:45.268
Is he in some kind of trouble?

13:45.334 --> 13:46.534
Not anymore.

13:46.601 --> 13:47.767
He's dead.

13:50.034 --> 13:51.534
Oh, my God.

13:51.601 --> 13:53.701
How do you know him?

13:53.767 --> 13:54.934
I just... I work for him.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.434
I keep his boat
clean and running.

13:56.951 --> 13:59.384
Did you clean it today?

13:59.451 --> 14:01.584
No, no, I just, I
just got started.

14:06.684 --> 14:08.851
Check out the kill switch.

14:08.918 --> 14:10.051
The strap's torn.

14:10.118 --> 14:11.784
Didn't our victim
have ligature marks

14:11.851 --> 14:13.217
On his ankle?

14:13.284 --> 14:14.584
What, do you think
somebody pushed Jason

14:14.651 --> 14:16.051
Out of his boat?
Yeah,

14:16.118 --> 14:18.350
And it means Jason took
the kill switch with him.

14:22.784 --> 14:24.884
If it disengages,
the motor shuts off.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.284
It means the killer had

14:26.350 --> 14:28.751
To get it back to ride
the boat back to shore.

14:28.818 --> 14:30.151
Yes, leaving Jason
to die.

14:30.217 --> 14:31.151
Where were you

14:31.217 --> 14:32.951
This morning?

14:33.018 --> 14:34.384
I was in the Keys.

14:34.451 --> 14:35.951
Party went late. I slept in.

14:37.384 --> 14:39.751
I got, like, 30 people
who can vouch for me.

14:39.818 --> 14:41.217
Really?

14:41.284 --> 14:42.484
Well, you're gonna need
more than 30 hungover

14:42.551 --> 14:43.984
College kids.
Like what?

14:44.051 --> 14:45.984
Like DNA, prints.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.818
Yeah, sure, whatever.

14:50.151 --> 14:52.250
What am I supposed to do now?

14:52.317 --> 14:53.250
Why don't you take

14:53.317 --> 14:54.851
The rest of the day off?

14:54.918 --> 14:56.085
We'll look after the boat.

14:56.151 --> 14:57.151
Okay?

15:03.085 --> 15:05.284
This is a sweet ride.

15:10.317 --> 15:14.718
It's a custom-Built
twin-Engine Donzi.

15:14.784 --> 15:16.684
1,400-Horsepower.

15:16.751 --> 15:19.317
This thing's so fast you can
barely see it on the radar.

15:19.384 --> 15:21.085
This is such a guy thing.

15:21.151 --> 15:22.517
I mean, there's really
only one reason

15:22.584 --> 15:24.185
To buy a boat
like this.

15:24.284 --> 15:25.684
Try to look cool.

15:27.718 --> 15:30.350
Oh, there's another reason.

15:30.417 --> 15:32.551
How about
drug smuggling?

15:32.617 --> 15:34.951
See these markings
on the hull here?

15:35.018 --> 15:36.784
Mm-Hmm.
Cement.

15:36.851 --> 15:39.451
It's used to affix
what's called a blister.

15:39.517 --> 15:41.051
Okay, I've heard of those.

15:41.118 --> 15:43.185
That's what they hide the drugs
inside to avoid detection.

15:50.584 --> 15:52.751
Blisters are usually
made of fiberglass

15:52.818 --> 15:54.684
And painted the same
color as the boat.

15:54.751 --> 15:56.185
Easy to pry off
in case

15:56.250 --> 15:58.118
The Coast Guard spots them.

16:03.884 --> 16:06.484
This blister's long gone,
though.

16:06.551 --> 16:09.984
But the cement
left a mark.

16:10.051 --> 16:11.851
Looks like there's
something in it.

16:11.918 --> 16:14.584
Looks like sand.

16:14.651 --> 16:18.384
There's no reason to run
a $500,000 boat aground

16:18.451 --> 16:19.384
On purpose.

16:19.451 --> 16:20.484
Nope,

16:20.491 --> 16:21.591
Not unless you're
in a real hurry

16:21.658 --> 16:23.291
To offload a drug shipment.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.858
Oh, great.

16:25.925 --> 16:29.524
Now we got to search hundreds
of miles of Florida coastline.

16:38.257 --> 16:40.491
BOA VISTA: I'm all up for a
treasure hunt and everything,

16:40.558 --> 16:42.124
But this is a lot
of ground to cover.

16:43.825 --> 16:46.024
And that's why I brought along
our new toy, the Profiler.

16:46.090 --> 16:47.224
It's electromagnetic,

16:47.291 --> 16:48.691
So it picks up
more than a metal detector.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.891
Yeah, but so far
all we've got is

16:50.957 --> 16:52.758
An iPod, four beer bottles,
and a beach towel,

16:52.825 --> 16:55.224
But no fiberglass blister
with the drugs.

16:55.291 --> 16:57.424
So we keep looking
until we find the blister.

16:57.491 --> 16:59.357
Hey, Calleigh.

17:00.391 --> 17:02.791
Is that who I
think it is?

17:02.858 --> 17:05.558
Yeah, Ryan Wolfe with
on-The-Spot coverage.

17:05.624 --> 17:09.391
God, he just keeps anticipating
our every move.

17:09.458 --> 17:12.490
Want me to go
talk to him?

17:12.757 --> 17:15.124
No, let's
keep working.

17:33.525 --> 17:35.324
No.

17:35.391 --> 17:36.924
I don't have my
tripod, Wolfe.

17:36.991 --> 17:40.590
How do I get a decent
close-Up of them from here?

17:40.657 --> 17:43.391
You're not shooting them, Eddie.
You're shooting me.

17:43.458 --> 17:44.891
What's the matter?

17:44.957 --> 17:49.358
Afraid your CSI colleagues
will steal the spotlight?

17:49.425 --> 17:51.525
I'm respecting their work.

17:51.590 --> 17:53.525
Come on, man.

17:53.590 --> 17:55.124
A little closer.

17:55.191 --> 17:56.391
Come on.
Get closer.

17:56.458 --> 17:58.258
There's no
crime scene tape.

17:59.464 --> 18:00.631
Hey, man,

18:00.697 --> 18:01.931
Just 'cause you heard
about this

18:01.997 --> 18:03.231
On the police scanner
doesn't mean

18:03.298 --> 18:04.764
You get to interfere
with a murder investigation.

18:04.830 --> 18:05.764
You understand that?

18:05.830 --> 18:07.331
You got that?

18:16.697 --> 18:19.364
I'm going to do my opener
from here, all right?

18:19.431 --> 18:21.097
Yeah, looks good,
looks good.

18:21.164 --> 18:22.531
I just want it
a little wider.

18:22.598 --> 18:24.631
Yeah.

18:27.431 --> 18:28.830
Get it off!

18:28.897 --> 18:30.631
Hey, hey, Eddie,
Eddie, Eddie, relax!

18:31.665 --> 18:34.031
Get it off me!
I can't.

18:34.097 --> 18:35.830
I can't get it off or
you're gonna bleed to death.

18:35.897 --> 18:37.198
Hold on.

18:37.264 --> 18:38.198
Call for help!

18:38.264 --> 18:40.364
Call Emergency!

18:40.431 --> 18:42.764
Get Rescue
out here now!

18:42.830 --> 18:44.598
Oh, get it off! Hold on, man, hold on.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.565
All right?

18:59.730 --> 19:02.764
He lost a lot of blood.

19:03.797 --> 19:06.364
It's going
to be close.

19:09.331 --> 19:11.464
You know, us being here
and us following you around,

19:11.531 --> 19:13.064
That's not my idea.

19:13.131 --> 19:16.697
The assignment editors wanted me
to follow up on a story.

19:18.764 --> 19:20.764
Just in case
you were wondering.

19:20.830 --> 19:23.665
No, I, I, I wasn't.

19:27.665 --> 19:29.931
It's just that, um...

19:29.997 --> 19:32.398
it's just that I'm on
somebody else's payroll now,

19:32.464 --> 19:34.697
And it's weird.

19:35.730 --> 19:37.764
I know.

19:37.830 --> 19:39.198
I mean, I-I've been there.

19:40.398 --> 19:42.231
When I worked for
the feds, it was easy

19:42.298 --> 19:44.730
To lose sight
of whose side I was on.

19:46.764 --> 19:48.997
What do you think I should do?

19:51.268 --> 19:54.768
Short term:
get away from the cameras;

19:56.317 --> 19:59.117
And long term: you're just
going to have to decide

19:59.183 --> 20:01.317
What your own priorities are.

20:11.134 --> 20:13.234
You sure you're okay?

20:15.267 --> 20:17.601
I'm fine. Thanks.

20:19.095 --> 20:21.295
Natalia, that trap was put
there to protect something.

20:21.362 --> 20:22.495
Will you bring
your camera?

20:22.562 --> 20:24.795
Yeah.

20:45.228 --> 20:47.362
Thing looks like something
out of Vietnam.

20:47.428 --> 20:50.362
Or drug runners trying
to protect their stash.

20:54.343 --> 20:55.123
What is it?

20:55.438 --> 20:56.805
Looks like when that
trap was triggered,

20:56.872 --> 20:59.405
It disturbed a lot of
the sand around here.

21:00.405 --> 21:02.072
It's the blister.

21:10.629 --> 21:11.788
Can you help me lift this?

21:11.823 --> 21:13.421
Yeah.

21:19.621 --> 21:21.388
Well, there's our
buried treasure.

21:26.388 --> 21:27.922
It's wrapped
in banana leaves

21:27.988 --> 21:29.254
To protect
from moisture.

21:29.321 --> 21:30.955
It's a common
practice in Cuba.

21:31.022 --> 21:32.988
Jason Billings
was in deep.

21:33.054 --> 21:34.555
This is a big stash.

21:34.621 --> 21:36.288
If you bury something
this well,

21:36.354 --> 21:37.721
You don't draw attention
to it

21:37.788 --> 21:38.922
By setting a trap.

21:38.988 --> 21:40.354
You do if you intend
to kill the person

21:40.421 --> 21:42.054
That's following you.

21:45.922 --> 21:48.221
By looking into your
brother's past, Mr. Billings,

21:48.288 --> 21:50.588
It shined a light on your own.

21:50.655 --> 21:51.655
What do you mean?

21:51.721 --> 21:53.955
It turns out
the boat is registered to you.

21:55.221 --> 21:56.855
Yeah, the boat's in my name,

21:56.922 --> 21:57.988
But I gave it to Jason.

21:58.054 --> 21:59.388
So what?

21:59.454 --> 22:01.421
Jason may have been killed
on the boat.

22:01.488 --> 22:04.354
Wait, I thought the vigilante
guy killed him on the beach.

22:04.421 --> 22:07.421
We have new information,
don't we?

22:07.488 --> 22:08.588
Like that the boat
was being used

22:08.655 --> 22:10.388
For drug running.

22:11.421 --> 22:14.955
I...

22:15.022 --> 22:16.988
I thought he was into something.

22:17.955 --> 22:19.121
But it was his business.

22:19.187 --> 22:21.022
I didn't ask.
We believe

22:21.087 --> 22:22.888
That Jason was offloading drugs.

22:22.955 --> 22:24.555
We want to know for who.

22:24.621 --> 22:27.388
Do you have any idea
who he hung out with?

22:27.454 --> 22:30.821
There was this one guy.

22:30.888 --> 22:32.321
Tony.

22:32.388 --> 22:34.721
Tony... Decker.

22:34.788 --> 22:36.388
He had those eyes, you know,

22:36.454 --> 22:37.721
Like he wasn't afraid
of anything.

22:37.788 --> 22:40.221
That's going to change.

23:12.187 --> 23:14.788
Tony Decker.

23:15.821 --> 23:18.621
Can I help you?

23:18.688 --> 23:20.054
I think you can, Tony.

23:20.121 --> 23:21.588
Jason Billings.

23:22.621 --> 23:25.221
I know a lot of people.

23:25.288 --> 23:26.821
I'm, uh, not so good

23:26.888 --> 23:28.555
With names, though.

23:28.621 --> 23:31.088
Jason used his boat
to smuggle drugs for you

23:31.355 --> 23:34.121
And now he's dead.

23:34.584 --> 23:37.185
Wow, that's...
that's creative, man.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.051
I understand
you have a connection

23:40.118 --> 23:43.351
With the Sovantes cartel
of Cuba.

23:43.418 --> 23:45.885
Connection to a drug cartel,

23:45.951 --> 23:48.718
Now... now you're just
flat-Out insulting me.

23:49.885 --> 23:52.318
Listen, I have three homes.

23:52.385 --> 23:55.151
Okay, a yacht, solid rep.

23:55.218 --> 23:57.084
Life is good, man.
Why would I kill anyone?

23:57.151 --> 23:59.185
Maybe to keep it that way.

24:02.652 --> 24:05.585
Well, when you have proof...

24:05.652 --> 24:08.051
then we'll talk.

24:33.618 --> 24:35.352
So what have we got?

24:35.419 --> 24:37.684
Well,my friend, you dug up

24:37.751 --> 24:40.352
20 kilos of
pure heroin,

24:40.419 --> 24:42.485
Street value:
$1.4 million.

24:42.551 --> 24:44.385
Wow.

24:44.452 --> 24:46.651
Do you have any idea who was
handling the banana leaves?

24:46.718 --> 24:48.785
Sand destroyed most
of the prints,

24:48.851 --> 24:51.851
But I found one on the underside
that was willing to cooperate.

24:51.918 --> 24:54.018
It belongs to the left
index finger of this guy.

24:54.085 --> 24:55.684
Cole Telford.

24:55.751 --> 24:57.385
Yeah, H got

24:57.452 --> 24:59.785
A reference sample from him
earlier, including that ten card.

24:59.851 --> 25:01.618
Doesn't he work
on Jason Billings's boat?

25:01.684 --> 25:03.618
I guess.

25:03.684 --> 25:06.118
When he's not smuggling
heroin from Cuba.

25:17.785 --> 25:19.718
I'm not a drug runner, sir.

25:19.785 --> 25:21.651
I promise you.

25:21.718 --> 25:23.985
I'm not interested in getting
bounced out of Dade University.

25:24.052 --> 25:25.352
See, we found your

25:25.419 --> 25:26.918
Fingerprint though, Cole,

25:26.985 --> 25:28.918
On ten kilos of pure heroin.

25:28.985 --> 25:31.018
Explain that to me.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.385
Whenever Jason offered
to take me for a ride,

25:38.452 --> 25:40.185
It was usually
for a mile for two.

25:40.252 --> 25:43.519
One day he says,
"How about Cuba?"

25:43.584 --> 25:45.285
I was all over it.

25:52.185 --> 25:55.018
That far. That fast.

25:55.085 --> 25:56.352
It was awesome.

25:56.419 --> 25:58.851
What happened
when you got there?

25:58.918 --> 26:00.419
It was like an Indy pit stop.

26:00.485 --> 26:03.718
Some guys directed
us in to refuel.

26:05.352 --> 26:06.918
And Jason asked me to help him.

26:12.851 --> 26:14.651
Hey, don't just stand there.

26:14.718 --> 26:16.551
Give me a hand with this,
will you, buddy?

26:16.618 --> 26:18.285
What is it?

26:19.718 --> 26:21.285
Come on. What does it look like?

26:22.485 --> 26:24.419
No, I can't, man. I shouldn't.

26:24.485 --> 26:26.318
Well, you don't,

26:26.385 --> 26:27.684
You're not coming back with me.

26:31.851 --> 26:35.452
You helped him
load the boat?

26:35.519 --> 26:38.285
I didn't have a choice.

26:38.352 --> 26:41.618
He had this look on his face
I'd never seen before.

26:41.684 --> 26:43.785
Did you help him bury
the product when you got back?

26:43.851 --> 26:46.818
No, my involvement ended
when we docked here.

26:46.885 --> 26:49.519
He told me to keep my mouth
shut, and I did. That's it.

26:49.584 --> 26:52.452
Well, I guess we're going
to find out, huh, Cole?

27:01.252 --> 27:03.651
Hmm, that is gruesome.

27:03.718 --> 27:04.818
So you found something
in the trap?

27:04.885 --> 27:06.218
Yeah, epithelia,

27:06.285 --> 27:08.951
But they're not from our
unfortunate cameraman.

27:11.352 --> 27:13.985
It matches the reference
sample of Cole Telford.

27:14.052 --> 27:15.785
The college kid.

27:15.851 --> 27:17.618
I found skin in this
hinge right here.

27:17.684 --> 27:18.785
He must've gotten pinched

27:18.851 --> 27:20.684
Trying to put this
contraption together.

27:25.751 --> 27:28.152
He lied his way out of the prints,
but I think he's going to have

27:28.218 --> 27:30.052
A tough time with this one.

27:30.118 --> 27:32.785
So you're a mechanical
engineering major?

27:32.851 --> 27:34.452
Yeah, got one semester to go.

27:34.519 --> 27:37.052
Hmm. I wouldn't be
in such a hurry.

27:37.118 --> 27:38.818
What's that?

27:38.885 --> 27:40.318
Oh, come off it,
Mr. Telford.

27:40.385 --> 27:41.985
Your DNA already
broke the news.

27:42.052 --> 27:44.618
You set the trap, and I'm
willing to bet you built it.

27:44.684 --> 27:46.885
Yeah.

27:46.951 --> 27:49.818
It was spring-Loaded
for 125 pounds of pressure.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.651
Jason loved the idea.

28:13.318 --> 28:15.318
Oh, get it off!

28:20.018 --> 28:21.152
Jason was paranoid.

28:21.218 --> 28:22.485
He thought Decker
was tracking us,

28:22.551 --> 28:24.018
That he'd do anything
to get his heroin back.

28:24.085 --> 28:26.385
The trap was
to send him a message.

28:26.452 --> 28:28.485
Well, you're going
to have a lot of time

28:28.551 --> 28:29.918
To work on your
communication skills.

28:29.985 --> 28:32.684
Is he going to be okay?

28:32.751 --> 28:34.818
The guy in the hospital?
He's recovering.

28:36.851 --> 28:38.784
Well, I guess I got lucky.

28:38.785 --> 28:43.218
Yeah, real lucky.
Now you got about 20 years to figure out how to build your next trap.

29:15.691 --> 29:16.858
Afternoon, Mr. Wolfe.

29:16.925 --> 29:18.025
Good afternoon.

29:18.092 --> 29:19.491
Who are you here to see?

29:28.825 --> 29:30.725
Yeah, bring him in.

29:30.791 --> 29:32.292
All right, listen,
I've got to go.

29:32.359 --> 29:35.058
Yeah. Bye.

29:38.392 --> 29:39.758
You're late, pal.

29:39.825 --> 29:42.325
What, did you get, uh,
stuck in the makeup chair?

29:42.392 --> 29:43.992
That's very funny.

29:44.058 --> 29:45.992
Where's your visitor's pass?

29:46.058 --> 29:47.258
Are you serious?

29:47.325 --> 29:49.058
Yeah, I'm serious.

29:50.425 --> 29:52.491
All right, so you're pissed
at me now, too?

29:52.558 --> 29:54.491
No, Wolfe, I got
my own problems.

29:54.558 --> 29:56.092
Now put your
visitor's pass on

29:56.158 --> 29:58.158
Before I get my ass thrown
out of here, all right?

29:58.225 --> 29:59.459
Now, what have
you got for me?

29:59.524 --> 30:01.925
This is so strange.

30:01.992 --> 30:04.891
Yeah.

30:09.258 --> 30:14.025
This is the footage
you dissected from your TV show?

30:14.092 --> 30:16.691
You know, uh, "As a CSI,

30:16.758 --> 30:19.524
I like to work from
the outside inward. "

30:19.591 --> 30:21.658
You have an uncanny gift
for impersonations.

30:21.725 --> 30:25.359
I actually should've
practiced what I preached.

30:25.425 --> 30:28.092
Take a look at the part where
Jason gets in the front seat.

30:30.425 --> 30:32.158
There. You see that?

30:32.225 --> 30:33.658
No, see what?

30:33.725 --> 30:35.192
All right, roll it back.

30:35.258 --> 30:36.459
Go back to where you started.

30:36.524 --> 30:37.691
Now, go slowly.

30:37.758 --> 30:40.192
At 30 frames per second,

30:40.258 --> 30:42.092
The surveillance cameras
record too slow

30:42.158 --> 30:44.359
To pick it up.

30:44.425 --> 30:45.591
Right there on the roof.

30:45.658 --> 30:46.992
Yeah, some kind of spark.

30:47.058 --> 30:48.459
And you were able
to see that?

30:48.524 --> 30:51.025
Not until I looked
between the frames.

30:51.092 --> 30:52.258
That's a good eye, Wolfe.

30:52.325 --> 30:53.491
How many times
have you watched this?

30:53.558 --> 30:57.359
After the, uh,
citywide manhunt, I started...

30:58.624 --> 31:01.658
A few.

31:01.725 --> 31:03.925
Now, that spark-
I think it's a ricochet.

31:04.992 --> 31:06.658
Somebody fired a bullet.

31:06.725 --> 31:09.891
Yeah, well, Sherry Williamson
didn't mention anything

31:09.958 --> 31:12.558
About gunfire to Horatio
when she spoke to him.

31:12.624 --> 31:15.258
She's been in on this
the whole time.

31:15.325 --> 31:16.858
Not bad, huh?

31:16.925 --> 31:18.225
I still got it.

31:18.292 --> 31:20.524
Yeah, it's, uh...

31:20.591 --> 31:23.192
it's just too bad you
can't do anything with it

31:23.258 --> 31:25.658
Because I'm going to be the
one taking it to the judge.

31:27.425 --> 31:28.858
Good work.

31:28.925 --> 31:30.425
Nice shirt.

31:31.925 --> 31:33.858
Wow...

31:33.925 --> 31:35.858
Sherry.

31:35.925 --> 31:38.891
The entire city
knows your name.

31:38.958 --> 31:41.524
You got citizens who wanted to
kill the man who assaulted you,

31:41.591 --> 31:44.359
And yet...

31:44.425 --> 31:46.891
you forgot to tell us that
someone took a shot at him.

31:46.958 --> 31:48.791
What? What are you
talking about?

31:48.858 --> 31:50.891
Come on.

31:50.958 --> 31:52.791
I know you're covering
for someone.

31:52.858 --> 31:55.958
You're on the hook right now
for conspiracy to commit murder.

31:56.025 --> 31:58.058
Don't take the fall.

31:58.125 --> 32:00.658
Give me the shooter.

32:08.058 --> 32:09.791
It was Jason's brother.

32:09.858 --> 32:11.491
Jason's brother, Paul?

32:14.225 --> 32:16.992
Yes. He came to me.

32:17.058 --> 32:18.425
Asked for help.

32:18.491 --> 32:19.791
Why you?

32:19.858 --> 32:23.658
Paul and I are seeing
each other on and off.

32:23.725 --> 32:25.825
The money he offered me,

32:25.891 --> 32:28.158
It would've set me up
for a long time.

32:28.225 --> 32:31.292
So, for a price, you were
supposed to lure Jason to your car?

32:35.758 --> 32:39.025
He grabbed coffee at the same
place every morning, early.

32:39.092 --> 32:41.325
So I pretended to
have car trouble.

32:44.992 --> 32:47.258
Excuse me, sir.
Could you help me?

32:47.325 --> 32:48.992
My car won't start.
Yeah.

32:49.058 --> 32:50.192
Sure, where are you parked?

32:50.258 --> 32:52.058
It's just right here.

32:52.125 --> 32:53.992
SHERRY: I got him there.
Paul said he'd do the rest.

32:57.958 --> 32:59.658
Help! Please, help me!

33:06.725 --> 33:09.524
DELKO: So Paul fired outside
the security camera's range.

33:14.392 --> 33:15.858
The plan was botched.

33:16.125 --> 33:17.625
Paul missed.

33:17.691 --> 33:20.724
And then I end up on the news,
damsel in distress.

33:20.791 --> 33:23.292
"Damsel in distress," huh?

33:24.891 --> 33:26.958
Well, I'm afraid this isn't

33:27.025 --> 33:28.958
Going to have a storybook
ending, Ms. Williamson.

33:30.659 --> 33:33.258
I hope your payday was worth it.

33:39.025 --> 33:40.958
TRIPP:
That's enough.

33:41.025 --> 33:43.559
We've been down this
dead-End road already.

33:43.625 --> 33:45.758
You're in just as deep
as your little brother.

33:47.292 --> 33:49.559
Running out of ways
to phrase this, guys.

33:49.625 --> 33:52.758
It was his mess, not mine.

33:52.824 --> 33:56.292
Why did you take a shot
at him in broad daylight?

33:57.325 --> 33:58.758
Talked to Sherry?

33:58.824 --> 34:00.225
You should've paid her more.

34:00.292 --> 34:02.325
She belted it out
like an opera singer.

34:04.592 --> 34:07.225
Jason was in deep with Decker.

34:07.292 --> 34:10.292
His shipment numbers
from Cuba weren't adding up.

34:10.358 --> 34:11.690
You work
for Decker, too?

34:11.757 --> 34:13.824
He told me to
take care of it.

34:13.891 --> 34:15.757
Yeah.

34:15.824 --> 34:16.958
By killing Jason.

34:17.025 --> 34:19.125
Or he'd kill us both.

34:19.192 --> 34:21.324
I couldn't do it.

34:21.391 --> 34:24.858
So I fired a shot
off the top of the car.

34:34.525 --> 34:36.659
Jason took you out
on his boat.

34:36.724 --> 34:39.525
What was the purpose
of that?

34:39.592 --> 34:42.492
He was asking me for help.

34:45.158 --> 34:47.158
Someone tried
to kill me this morning.

34:48.659 --> 34:50.625
I think Tony's sent one
of his goons after me.

34:50.690 --> 34:52.592
Return the kilos
you took from him.

34:52.659 --> 34:54.492
It'll all go away.

34:54.559 --> 34:56.225
I promise.

34:57.559 --> 34:59.559
It's too late.

34:59.625 --> 35:01.258
W- What are you
looking for?

35:01.325 --> 35:03.091
You still carry
that Glock with you?

35:03.158 --> 35:05.991
No, and I wouldn't give it
to you if I did.

35:09.958 --> 35:11.392
You're one
of Tony's goons, Paulie?

35:11.458 --> 35:13.891
No, it wasn't like that.

35:13.958 --> 35:15.458
Go ahead. Finish it, Paulie.

35:15.525 --> 35:16.691
Come on. Finish it.

35:16.758 --> 35:18.292
Finish it, Paulie.

35:37.192 --> 35:39.492
He never surfaced.

36:05.325 --> 36:07.392
I recovered
the boat's kill switch,

36:07.458 --> 36:09.392
Rode back to shore.

36:09.458 --> 36:11.691
Worked out well
for you, didn't it?

36:14.124 --> 36:16.625
I never wanted him to drown.

36:16.692 --> 36:19.792
I just wanted him to give
the drugs back to Tony.

36:19.858 --> 36:23.191
I loved my brother.

36:24.224 --> 36:26.892
Get him out of here.

36:34.092 --> 36:35.858
Cause of death
was a broken neck.

36:35.925 --> 36:37.291
Guy's spinning us a yarn.

36:37.358 --> 36:38.892
Or maybe he's telling the truth,

36:38.958 --> 36:40.858
And somebody else
finished him off.

37:01.892 --> 37:02.992
Jimmy, push it!

37:03.058 --> 37:04.525
Get these guys off my ass!

37:06.324 --> 37:07.825
Get inside.

37:33.956 --> 37:36.556
This is the United States
Coast Guard

37:36.622 --> 37:37.823
And Miami-Dade
Police Department.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.789
Prepare to be boarded.

37:39.856 --> 37:44.489
Everyone on board your vessel
must immediately come topside.

38:06.515 --> 38:10.481
Did you have an accident
on your boat?

38:19.675 --> 38:20.625
It happens, you know?

38:20.660 --> 38:21.575
Day on the water.

38:21.642 --> 38:23.176
It gets slippery.

38:23.243 --> 38:26.842
It certainly was
for Jason Billings.

38:26.909 --> 38:28.909
He was never on my yacht, man.

38:28.976 --> 38:31.176
We found his blood
on your deck,

38:31.243 --> 38:34.909
And his cause of death
was a broken neck.

38:40.709 --> 38:42.742
Jason, uh...

38:43.934 --> 38:46.667
He drove the fastest boat
in Miami,

38:46.734 --> 38:48.099
And when his shipments
started coming in short,

38:48.219 --> 38:50.152
He would lie to me.

38:50.776 --> 38:52.052
Blame my Cuban suppliers.

38:52.391 --> 38:53.491
So you followed him.

38:54.098 --> 38:54.804
I had no choice.

38:54.839 --> 38:56.906
I knew his brother
wasn't going to finish the job.

38:57.222 --> 38:59.922
He left him out in the water.

39:08.655 --> 39:11.655
Hey, hey, hey.

39:12.923 --> 39:15.124
Give me your hand.

39:18.028 --> 39:20.028
Where are my missing kilos?

39:20.094 --> 39:21.727
I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:23.327 --> 39:25.527
You don't tell me where it is,
you're going right back in.

39:25.594 --> 39:27.127
You understand me?

39:27.194 --> 39:29.360
You won't kill me, man.

39:29.427 --> 39:32.093
I'm the only way
you'll get any of it back.

39:32.160 --> 39:35.260
You're right.
You're right.

39:48.454 --> 39:49.452
I cut my losses, man.

39:50.627 --> 39:53.026
Kid didn't want
to save his own life,

39:53.093 --> 39:55.327
I wasn't about
to save it for him.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.560
You're quite a humanitarian,
aren't you?

39:59.694 --> 40:01.660
Take him.

40:17.560 --> 40:20.360
Here to comment on our latest
breaking news story,

40:20.427 --> 40:24.427
Our resident crime expert,
former CSI, Ryan Wolfe.

40:26.527 --> 40:28.759
Hi, Heather.

40:28.826 --> 40:30.826
A woman in Pensacola drowned

40:30.893 --> 40:32.227
Her two young children
this afternoon

40:32.293 --> 40:34.327
Before taking
her own life.

40:34.393 --> 40:36.460
Is this postpartum...

40:46.060 --> 40:47.560
What?

40:47.627 --> 40:50.393
Is this postpartum
pushed to the extreme,

40:50.460 --> 40:52.893
Or is there some
societal influence at work?

40:52.960 --> 40:56.859
No, no, that's just horrible
is what it is.

40:56.926 --> 40:58.726
You know, to be honest,
I don't think

40:58.793 --> 41:00.160
It's really our right
to speculate

41:00.227 --> 41:01.759
On a mother who
drowned her children.

41:01.826 --> 41:02.926
But if you had to.

41:02.993 --> 41:04.594
But I don't have to.

41:04.660 --> 41:06.360
And I don't want to.

41:06.427 --> 41:07.694
I'm sorry, I...

41:07.759 --> 41:09.126
I'm sorry, Heather.

41:10.793 --> 41:12.826
Look, my time spent
here has been, uh...

41:12.893 --> 41:14.360
It's been really
fascinating.

41:14.427 --> 41:15.826
It's been great.

41:15.893 --> 41:18.826
But there's someplace else
I think I got to be.

41:26.660 --> 41:28.594
There are men and women

41:28.660 --> 41:32.193
Who put themselves
in harm's way every day.

41:32.260 --> 41:34.460
It's their lives for ours.

41:34.527 --> 41:38.260
And for them, it's not
something that they do.

41:38.327 --> 41:40.493
It's something that...
that, you know, they are.

41:50.293 --> 41:51.893
Now, I'm not going to try

41:51.960 --> 41:54.427
To make myself sound
so honorable,

41:54.493 --> 41:56.759
But I took an oath.

41:56.826 --> 41:59.427
I took an oath
to protect

41:59.493 --> 42:02.527
People in Miami,
and, uh...

42:07.826 --> 42:09.859
I was born to be a cop.

42:13.533 --> 42:15.533
And, um...

42:20.886 --> 42:22.587
I think I lost that
along the way.

42:28.092 --> 42:31.226
So...

42:42.543 --> 42:44.476
Hey, H.

42:44.543 --> 42:46.376
You helped us, Mr. Wolfe.

42:46.443 --> 42:48.443
Yeah, it was the least
I could do.

42:53.547 --> 42:55.087
But you consorted
with a known felon,

42:55.119 --> 42:57.209
And that's not going
to go away anytime soon.

42:57.226 --> 42:58.793
You understand that?

42:58.859 --> 43:00.893
I don't expect it to.

43:00.960 --> 43:02.626
Everything you've done
in the past,

43:02.693 --> 43:06.060
Everything you do today
will come under close scrutiny.

43:10.370 --> 43:13.803
I may not get my job back.

43:14.817 --> 43:16.984
But every case
that gets reopened,

43:17.051 --> 43:19.051
I'm going to answer to.

43:21.750 --> 43:24.750
I'm not going
to abandon this team.

43:27.350 --> 43:29.384
And we, Mr. Wolfe,

43:29.449 --> 43:31.449
Are not going
to abandon you.
