WEBVTT

00:03.765 --> 00:05.957
So you need a divorce attorney?

00:06.052 --> 00:08.263
Tell me, who is the
soon-to-be lucky guy?

00:08.264 --> 00:10.685
Okay, Cliff, for your Infowars,

00:10.686 --> 00:12.814
his name is Ben, and he's Jewish.

00:12.815 --> 00:14.442
So you're gonna have
to bring your A game.

00:14.443 --> 00:16.071
Okay, well, why would you want me

00:16.072 --> 00:17.991
to represent you?
I actively dislike you.

00:17.992 --> 00:19.995
All my girlfriends think
that you made me hate women,

00:19.996 --> 00:21.498
which is completely ridiculous.

00:21.499 --> 00:23.460
My mom made me hate women.

00:23.461 --> 00:25.632
Well, you know, I just saw
your ad in the subway,

00:25.633 --> 00:27.761
and you just looked
so hot and competent.

00:27.762 --> 00:29.347
Yeah, people keep saying that.

00:29.348 --> 00:31.184
I was worried it was a little corny.

00:31.185 --> 00:33.648
Oh, no, I love it.
You should wear that monocle.

00:33.649 --> 00:35.317
Well, look, he's gonna
want to destroy you.

00:35.318 --> 00:36.988
Trust me, I dated you
for a couple months,

00:36.989 --> 00:39.242
- and I wanted to destroy you.
- That is unfair.

00:39.243 --> 00:41.914
I've seen you through your
darkest family tragedies.

00:41.915 --> 00:44.920
You burned down the church
at my grandmother's funeral.

00:44.921 --> 00:47.049
Yeah, a fire which revealed
the chilling remains

00:47.050 --> 00:49.847
of a murdered nun.
You're welcome "Dateline."

00:49.848 --> 00:51.684
No, this is gonna get ugly,
so don't talk to Ben directly.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.270
You're only gonna fight.

00:53.271 --> 00:54.732
Do everything through your attorneys.

00:54.733 --> 00:55.942
Fight? What am I gonna fight over,

00:55.943 --> 00:57.320
half his "Star Wars" collection?

00:57.345 --> 01:00.767
The only good one of those
movies was "Spaceballs."

01:01.120 --> 01:04.125

01:07.776 --> 01:09.664
Now, before we finish this meeting,

01:09.689 --> 01:11.765
I would like all of us
to send a lot of love

01:11.790 --> 01:14.959
to a woman whose heart
battered and cracked

01:15.023 --> 01:16.901
like an old baseball glove.

01:16.902 --> 01:18.403
Okay, that's enough.

01:18.404 --> 01:21.284
Yes, I am divorcing Ben, but it's fine.

01:21.285 --> 01:22.996
We weren't even that married.

01:22.997 --> 01:24.833
I barely had time to let myself go.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.837
Is divorce necessary?

01:26.838 --> 01:29.175
What if I find Ben a mistress
or prescribe you some opium?

01:29.176 --> 01:31.221
No, stop. Hey, look at me.

01:31.222 --> 01:33.685
You let me know when you're
your old self again, okay?

01:33.686 --> 01:35.730
'Cause I want to hook up Ben
with some girls.

01:35.731 --> 01:37.693
No, no, no, listen.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:37.694 --> 01:39.362
The baker didn't want to make this,

01:39.363 --> 01:40.949
'cause it's so depressing.

01:40.950 --> 01:43.245
Guys, I'm fine. I have a great job,

01:43.246 --> 01:44.873
I have a great kid,
I have great friends.

01:44.874 --> 01:46.292
Yeah, but you don't have a husband,

01:46.293 --> 01:47.546
and that's all you ever wanted.

01:47.547 --> 01:49.800
I'm so sorry, Dr. L.

01:49.801 --> 01:52.138
You know you can join our team anytime.

01:52.139 --> 01:54.225
I don't have to be gay yet.

01:54.226 --> 01:56.020
Okay, I'm going. I'm taking the cake,

01:56.021 --> 01:57.398
and I'm not sharing it with any of you.

01:57.399 --> 01:58.693
- Oh, that's...
- Oh, come on!

01:58.694 --> 02:01.030
Tam, what's the deal?

02:01.031 --> 02:02.784
You haven't spoken to me in weeks,

02:02.785 --> 02:04.370
and I think it has something to do

02:04.371 --> 02:05.874
with our steamy night of erotic play.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.544
It was only steamy because your dogs

02:07.545 --> 02:09.045
were breathing all over us.

02:09.047 --> 02:10.758
I'm sorry, but it was a mistake.

02:10.758 --> 02:12.721
No, no, a mistake
is when I cut my scrubs

02:12.722 --> 02:15.309
into capri pants.
What we did is beautiful.

02:15.310 --> 02:17.104
Look, no, I was full of hormones

02:17.105 --> 02:19.317
from fertility injections,
and I was emotional.

02:19.318 --> 02:21.196
- It can't happen again.
- Listen...

02:21.197 --> 02:22.699
[door rattling]

02:22.700 --> 02:24.578
Hey, did you guys lock the door?

02:24.579 --> 02:26.498
It's Colette! Come on!

02:26.499 --> 02:29.713
Hey, don't make me
Kool-Aid Man this bitch.

02:29.714 --> 02:32.426
How are things in the romance
department, Jeremy?

02:32.427 --> 02:34.598
So recently I bedded a docent

02:34.599 --> 02:36.852
in the Georgian room at the Met.

02:36.853 --> 02:38.981
Now, the bed was neoclassical,

02:38.982 --> 02:42.279
but the sex, ooh, quite rococo.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.367
Uh...

02:44.368 --> 02:46.956
Sorry, I just came in here

02:46.957 --> 02:48.709
to grab a new hand sanitizer.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.089
Someone touched mine.

02:51.090 --> 02:53.385
Well, that was more awkward
than when we ran into

02:53.386 --> 02:55.013
Daddy's Hispanic family at dinner.

02:55.014 --> 02:57.351
Nice folks, the Kimball-Rubios.

02:57.352 --> 02:59.063
But I feel bad.

02:59.064 --> 03:01.025
Anna came over to
the apartment a few weeks ago.

03:01.026 --> 03:02.821
I think to try and get back together,

03:02.822 --> 03:05.242
but, well, I was "entertaining."

03:05.243 --> 03:08.373
Anna wants to get back
together, and you told her no?

03:08.374 --> 03:10.460
So now you're just spitting
in the face of the universe?

03:10.461 --> 03:12.423
You told me I should use
the breakup as an opportunity

03:12.424 --> 03:13.885
to level-up to hotter women.

03:13.886 --> 03:15.680
That was the gin talking.

03:15.681 --> 03:17.601
Of course you should
get back together with Anna.

03:17.602 --> 03:20.523
That's the bourbon talking.
Always trust the bourbon.

03:20.524 --> 03:22.151
Anna wants to have
more experiences dating,

03:22.152 --> 03:23.988
and I think she has a point.

03:23.989 --> 03:26.367
Well, there's your mistake.
Women don't have points.

03:26.368 --> 03:29.332
They have well-informed hysteria.

03:29.333 --> 03:32.212
Now let's see what
Mr. Jose Cuervo has to say.

03:32.213 --> 03:34.300
Dr. L! Dr. L!

03:34.301 --> 03:35.845
Karen, knock much?

03:35.846 --> 03:37.641
I thought I heard a bear in here.

03:37.642 --> 03:39.770
Uh, does it look like
there's a bear in here?

03:39.771 --> 03:42.316
Just a beautiful, feminine woman
eating an enormous cake.

03:42.317 --> 03:45.280
Well, there's some weird guy
out there asking for you.

03:45.281 --> 03:48.328
He's wearing cargo shorts
with a beer in each pocket.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.413
Wassup?

03:49.414 --> 03:51.459
Ahh! Peter!

03:51.460 --> 03:53.296
This is so great. Hi!

03:53.297 --> 03:55.635
- Hey. How you doing?
- What are you doing here?

03:55.636 --> 03:58.056
Well, Lauren got a new job
as the head of neurosurgery

03:58.057 --> 04:01.605
at Lenox Hill, so we're
living back in New York, baby!

04:01.606 --> 04:02.899
Oh, my God, this is amazing.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.861
Peter, I have missed you so much.

04:04.862 --> 04:06.907
Can my whole family crash
with you for a little bit?

04:06.908 --> 04:08.744
You see, we bought a condo
at Trump Tower,

04:08.745 --> 04:10.205
but we don't speak Russian,

04:10.206 --> 04:11.750
so it's really hard to make friends.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.336
Of course you can stay with me.

04:13.337 --> 04:15.048
Lucky for you, my marriage
just fell apart.

04:15.049 --> 04:17.512
I heard about that,
and I want to tell you,

04:17.512 --> 04:19.725
that dude, Ben, I never trusted him.

04:19.726 --> 04:22.229
I mean, who doesn't drink beer
when they're on antibiotics?

04:22.230 --> 04:24.108
You know what, everyone is
making a big deal about it,

04:24.109 --> 04:25.945
but my marriage was
just not meant to be.

04:25.946 --> 04:27.489
I'm doing fine.

04:27.490 --> 04:29.953
Mindy, no, you're not. I can see.

04:29.954 --> 04:32.416
You let your moustache
grow in from the sides.

04:32.417 --> 04:35.047
There's some of that cake that
hasn't been demolished yet.

04:35.048 --> 04:37.802
Something's not right,
and I am gonna make it better.

04:37.803 --> 04:40.099
Peter's back in New York!

04:43.147 --> 04:45.735
Guys, it's great to see you,
but you disgust me.

04:45.736 --> 04:48.448
No one is gonna throw Mindy
a party to cheer her up?

04:48.449 --> 04:50.368
They made me the office party planner

04:50.369 --> 04:53.584
because I'm gay, but I'm
the wrong kind of gay for that.

04:53.585 --> 04:56.297
Well, I say we throw her
a karaoke party.

04:56.298 --> 04:57.884
Oh, yes, oh, my God.

04:57.885 --> 04:59.971
I call "O Holy Night of Bethlehem."

04:59.972 --> 05:02.017
It's yours. We're gonna do it

05:02.018 --> 05:04.188
at this great place I found in Koreatown

05:04.189 --> 05:07.194
when I was chased out of
a massage parlor for my demands

05:07.195 --> 05:09.323
and I ran into a karaoke bar.

05:09.324 --> 05:11.077
- What?
- Who are you again?

05:11.078 --> 05:13.206
You have the entitlement
of a guy who works here

05:13.207 --> 05:15.795
but the demeanor of a guy who
gets injured in a viral video.

05:15.796 --> 05:19.218
Thank you. And may I just say... shwing!

05:19.219 --> 05:21.055
- Yeah.
- What is that?

05:21.056 --> 05:23.101
I'm Peter Prentice.
I used to be a doctor here.

05:23.102 --> 05:25.063
I didn't even work with Peter
and I love him.

05:25.064 --> 05:26.817
I think he might be my favorite Jew,

05:26.818 --> 05:28.403
'cause he doesn't rub your face in it.

05:28.404 --> 05:29.906
He doesn't take half of September off

05:29.907 --> 05:32.244
- for Rosh this or Yom that.
- Stop.

05:32.245 --> 05:34.081
Wait, so you moved back here,

05:34.082 --> 05:35.501
but you don't currently have a practice?

05:35.502 --> 05:36.962
Mm-hmm, I was doing the whole

05:36.963 --> 05:38.591
stay-at-home-day thing for a bit,

05:38.592 --> 05:41.137
but you know what,
I want to buy my own weed

05:41.138 --> 05:44.268
and my own sneakers, like a real man.

05:44.269 --> 05:46.940
Hey, that's my sandwich.

05:46.941 --> 05:50.322
No, it's not. This is Karen's.

05:50.323 --> 05:54.122
- I'm Karen.
- Then this is your sandwich.

05:54.582 --> 05:55.958
MINDY: Thanks for treating us
to such a fancy dinner,

05:55.959 --> 05:57.377
Mom and Dad.

05:57.378 --> 05:59.256
We had to pick a nice restaurant,

05:59.257 --> 06:01.427
because we have so much to celebrate.

06:01.428 --> 06:04.517
Oh, you must mean
my newly found independence,

06:04.518 --> 06:06.521
and it's so nice that
you called it a celebration.

06:06.522 --> 06:09.193
- It's very modern of you.
- No, dingus.

06:09.194 --> 06:12.825
We're here so you can meet
my girlfriend, Parvati.

06:12.826 --> 06:14.453
I'm sorry. You're his girlfriend?

06:14.454 --> 06:15.957
I thought you were some random cousin

06:15.958 --> 06:17.627
from the Pittsburgh light-skins.

06:17.628 --> 06:20.048
Nah. Parvati and I met when we were sat

06:20.049 --> 06:22.052
next to each other at a wedding table,

06:22.053 --> 06:23.471
and I was hella charming,

06:23.472 --> 06:25.267
'cause my edible hadn't kicked in.

06:25.268 --> 06:27.396
And we've been serious
for, like, a year.

06:27.397 --> 06:29.233
Well, Parvati, what do you do?

06:29.234 --> 06:32.447
I'm a pediatric oncologist
at Columbia Presbyterian.

06:32.448 --> 06:34.995
- Damn.
- She's changed my life, okay?

06:34.996 --> 06:38.126
As a matter of fact... waiter.

06:38.127 --> 06:40.255
I think it's time for dessert.

06:40.256 --> 06:43.512
Parvati, this last year has been
the greatest year of my life,

06:43.513 --> 06:46.434
and I just want you to know
that no matter what happens,

06:46.435 --> 06:49.315
I will always... nah! No, Mindy!

06:49.316 --> 06:51.945
- The ring is in there!
- [gasps]

06:51.946 --> 06:54.784
Okay, I definitely swallowed it.

06:54.785 --> 06:56.412
- No!
- Ahh!

06:56.413 --> 06:58.526
But I could tell
that it was big and nice.

06:58.551 --> 06:59.762
Yeah.

07:03.207 --> 07:05.658
Rishi, I can't give you
the ring right now.

07:05.683 --> 07:08.061
All right, tell Parvati
I'll give it to her tomorrow.

07:08.062 --> 07:10.566
11:00 A. M. on the dot.
I am very regular.

07:10.567 --> 07:12.235
It's cool. I told her
how much the ring cost,

07:12.236 --> 07:14.031
and that's all that really matters.

07:14.032 --> 07:15.659
She posted a picture
of the receipt on Instagram.

07:15.660 --> 07:17.997
I'm really happy for you, Rishi.

07:17.998 --> 07:20.043
God, what a reversal of fortune, huh?

07:20.044 --> 07:22.924
I know. It's almost like
we switched places.

07:22.925 --> 07:26.055
You know, you're struggling;
I'm succeeding.

07:26.056 --> 07:28.267
<i>You're getting a divorce;
I'm getting married.</i>

07:28.268 --> 07:31.107
I even grew an inch last month;
you seem to be shrinking.

07:31.108 --> 07:34.029
So, uh... I mean,
you're doing great too.

07:34.030 --> 07:35.449
MINDY: Okay, bye.

07:37.538 --> 07:41.085
[knocking]

07:41.086 --> 07:42.505
- Hey!
- Hi!

07:42.506 --> 07:43.799
How's it going? Hi, Henry.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.719
Come on in. Good to see you.

07:45.720 --> 07:48.182
- Make yourself at home.
- Hi. Thank you.

07:48.183 --> 07:50.563
Wow, Lauren.

07:50.564 --> 07:53.276
Uh, first of all, it's great to see you.

07:53.277 --> 07:56.616
Second of all, so I guess
you got a perm, huh?

07:56.617 --> 07:58.579
I know, it looks bad.

07:58.580 --> 08:00.875
It looked much better in Texas
where there's no humidity.

08:00.876 --> 08:03.379
- Eh.
- Look, I am so sorry

08:03.380 --> 08:06.218
that my apartment is not as
palatial as your Texas mansion.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.014
But I will say this.

08:08.015 --> 08:09.517
The rats are starting
to eat the cockroaches,

08:09.518 --> 08:11.228
so we barely have any cockroaches.

08:11.229 --> 08:12.940
Well, don't even worry about us.

08:12.941 --> 08:14.569
We will not in this apartment
that much at all.

08:14.570 --> 08:16.405
Besides, we have your karaoke party.

08:16.406 --> 08:18.409
Karaoke? Peter, just remember

08:18.410 --> 08:19.871
not to say the N word this time.

08:19.872 --> 08:21.625
It was in the lyrics.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.503
You were singing "Sweet Caroline."

08:23.504 --> 08:25.674
You know, I told you,
I don't need this karaoke party.

08:25.675 --> 08:27.637
My parents tried to cheer me up.
It completely backfired.

08:27.638 --> 08:29.641
Mindy, everybody already RSVP'd.

08:29.642 --> 08:31.310
Jeremy, Jodi, Anna.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.147
Who's this Anna you keep talking about?

08:33.148 --> 08:34.817
There was never an Anna before.

08:34.818 --> 08:36.403
Now all of a sudden everyone's all like,

08:36.404 --> 08:38.073
"Anna, Anna, Anna."

08:38.075 --> 08:41.080
Oh, Anna's so cool.

08:41.081 --> 08:42.667
This is her.

08:42.668 --> 08:44.921
Yeah, I actually
stole this from her house,

08:44.922 --> 08:46.716
and I was gonna take her photo out,

08:46.717 --> 08:48.512
but she's so pretty,
I thought I'd leave it in.

08:48.513 --> 08:50.390
She's not that pretty.

08:50.391 --> 08:52.562
I mean, her hair is straight,
if that's your thing.

08:52.563 --> 08:54.189
Honestly, straight, curly,
it wouldn't matter

08:54.190 --> 08:56.068
when it's framing
a perfect face like that.

08:56.069 --> 08:59.199
She's pretty, like, if
you think Kate Upton's pretty.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.538
- Yeah, I think everybody does.
- You know what, guys?

09:01.539 --> 09:03.542
I think I will go to karaoke with you,

09:03.543 --> 09:05.838
and maybe I'll debut a new song.

09:05.839 --> 09:07.633
It will likely have the N word in it.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.386
Mm-mm.

09:09.387 --> 09:10.639
Colette: Do you know
what's wrong with Morgan?

09:10.640 --> 09:12.852
He's been acting so sad.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.189
I don't know. Why you asking me?

09:15.190 --> 09:17.903
Do I look guilty? 'Cause I'm not.

09:17.904 --> 09:19.866
Hey, there are my girls.

09:19.867 --> 09:21.703
Yeah, I don't really know you like that.

09:21.704 --> 09:23.790
My brother and I replaced you
when you left.

09:23.791 --> 09:26.128
I know you, but I don't
think we ever spoke.

09:26.129 --> 09:28.382
Okay. Where's Mindy?

09:28.383 --> 09:30.428
Last time I saw her,
she was in the bathroom.

09:30.429 --> 09:32.349
She put a colander in the toilet

09:32.350 --> 09:34.646
and is trying to pass a diamond ring.

09:34.647 --> 09:36.524
It is not going well.

09:36.525 --> 09:38.987
Man, that's such a bummer.
I really wanted to work

09:38.988 --> 09:41.075
on my karaoke set list
with her at lunch.

09:41.076 --> 09:44.039
Don't be intimidated, but in my frat

09:44.040 --> 09:46.377
I was in a singing group
called Cockapella.

09:46.378 --> 09:48.965
Peter. Would you like
to have lunch with me?

09:48.966 --> 09:50.385
I've been meaning to talk to you.

09:50.386 --> 09:51.763
You want to have lunch with me?

09:51.764 --> 09:53.265
- Yes.
- Okay.

09:53.266 --> 09:54.769
I'll have lunch with you, but

09:54.770 --> 09:56.982
I have no money, so you'll have to pay.

10:00.949 --> 10:03.411
Anna. Anna Bo-banna.

10:03.412 --> 10:05.624
[sing-song] Makin' copies.

10:05.625 --> 10:07.920
No, I hate that. Please put that back.

10:07.921 --> 10:09.716
Thank you.

10:09.717 --> 10:11.553
Peter, I asked you in here
for professional reasons.

10:11.554 --> 10:13.682
Professional? You need a pap smear?

10:13.683 --> 10:14.851
You came to the right guy.

10:14.852 --> 10:16.311
When I was Mindy's OBGYN,

10:16.312 --> 10:18.357
she used to call me Pappa Smurf.

10:18.358 --> 10:20.361
I'm very happy to say I don't
understand what that means.

10:20.362 --> 10:22.867
Peter, I would like to offer you a job.

10:22.868 --> 10:24.954
- My job.
- Why, are you leaving?

10:24.955 --> 10:28.712
Jeremy has rebuffed my advances,

10:28.713 --> 10:32.051
and it's just too difficult
to face him every day.

10:32.052 --> 10:35.099
Jerem... I'm sorry.

10:35.100 --> 10:37.353
Jeremy turned you down?

10:37.354 --> 10:38.815
What, are you some kinda weirdo?

10:38.816 --> 10:40.652
No, I'm within the range of normal.

10:40.653 --> 10:42.405
I'd be happy to show you my brain scans.

10:42.406 --> 10:43.909
So what do you say?

10:43.910 --> 10:45.579
Will you take my spot at Shulman?

10:45.580 --> 10:49.837
I don't know. Let me think about it.

10:49.838 --> 10:53.344
Let me smoke about it.
And let me stroke about it.

10:53.345 --> 10:55.432
Please leave.

10:57.186 --> 10:59.982
Oh, Morgan, there is a ring in here.

10:59.983 --> 11:01.569
I need you to go to Brooklyn
and give it to my brother.

11:01.570 --> 11:03.615
Ooh, I would love to.

11:03.616 --> 11:05.869
Afterwards, I would like you
to go to my apartment

11:05.870 --> 11:08.040
and pick out a cute outfit
for karaoke tonight.

11:08.041 --> 11:09.836
Oh yeah, I'll pull some new
looks for the fitting.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.548
- Thank you.
- Hey, I gotta say something.

11:11.549 --> 11:13.467
I'm loving the new attitude, Dr. L.

11:13.468 --> 11:15.388
You know, Morgan,
I was thinking about it,

11:15.389 --> 11:16.933
and I have a lot to be thankful for.

11:16.934 --> 11:18.812
I got a great job, I got a great son,

11:18.813 --> 11:21.316
and "Will &amp; Grace" is back
and bitchier than ever.

11:21.317 --> 11:23.028
- Life is good.
- Damn straight.

11:23.029 --> 11:24.574
These are the best years of your life.

11:24.575 --> 11:26.159
- Right?
- Oh, oh!

11:26.160 --> 11:27.705
And Cliff, the divorce lawyer, called.

11:27.706 --> 11:29.835
Ben wants half of all your money.

11:34.511 --> 11:36.471
- Hello, Peter.
- Hey, there he is.

11:36.472 --> 11:38.560
I am so excited for tonight.

11:38.561 --> 11:41.189
I don't want to ruin things,
but we may be getting a visit

11:41.190 --> 11:43.570
from Peter, Paul and Jeremy.

11:43.571 --> 11:45.616
What the hell is wrong with you?

11:45.617 --> 11:47.493
Well, how much time do you have?

11:47.494 --> 11:49.832
Weak pelvis, soft ankles.

11:49.833 --> 11:51.794
No, you have this girl,
Anna, who works in this office,

11:51.795 --> 11:53.380
who is so cute.

11:53.381 --> 11:55.677
She's a living, life-size Bratz doll,

11:55.678 --> 11:59.644
and she's into you,
who is a grade-A Jeremy.

11:59.645 --> 12:02.858
Listen, I admit I might have
been a bit of a tit in the past,

12:02.859 --> 12:05.029
but things have changed. I'm cool now.

12:05.030 --> 12:08.118
Look, you're a weird guy,
as you've just proved

12:08.119 --> 12:10.331
by referring to yourself as a tit.

12:10.332 --> 12:12.628
But that's what's great about you,

12:12.629 --> 12:14.464
and if you can find a weird girl

12:14.465 --> 12:16.426
whose weirdness matches
up with your weirdness,

12:16.427 --> 12:20.185
pfft, I wouldn't let that go.

12:20.687 --> 12:22.815
LAUREN: Hey, Mindy, I'm back.

12:22.816 --> 12:24.067
Mindy?

12:24.068 --> 12:26.238
Oh, God, she's dead.

12:26.239 --> 12:28.492
I knew it would happen,
but it's still sad.

12:28.493 --> 12:30.121
- Ah! Ah! Ah!
- Ohh.

12:30.122 --> 12:32.166
- I'm not dead!
- What's wrong with you?

12:32.167 --> 12:34.045
Help me up. God.

12:34.046 --> 12:35.549
Why were you on the floor?

12:35.550 --> 12:37.301
I was extremely sad.

12:37.302 --> 12:39.974
Oh, are you thinking
about your ex-husband?

12:39.975 --> 12:43.022
He was very, very attractive.

12:43.023 --> 12:44.482
I had a dream about him.

12:44.483 --> 12:46.529
- What?
- I did.

12:46.530 --> 12:48.490
Okay, no, it was the right decision

12:48.491 --> 12:52.415
to get divorced from Ben,
but it's getting really messy.

12:52.416 --> 12:55.212
Lauren, do you know he wants
half of everything I own?

12:55.213 --> 12:56.674
- No.
- What's he gonna do

12:56.675 --> 12:58.135
with 12 Omaha steaks every month?

12:58.136 --> 12:59.597
You know, I was married before

12:59.598 --> 13:01.601
to a guy who was horrible, and, man,

13:01.602 --> 13:05.274
the years after my divorce
were the hardest of my life.

13:05.275 --> 13:07.863
But they were also
very valuable, because they

13:07.864 --> 13:10.159
gave me a chance to really
figure out what I needed.

13:10.160 --> 13:11.788
Which was Peter?

13:11.789 --> 13:14.502
Look, I'm as shocked as you, but, yeah.

13:14.503 --> 13:17.006
- Hey, where is Peter anyway?
- Oh, Peter.

13:17.007 --> 13:19.595
Last I heard, he was
having lunch with Anna.

13:19.596 --> 13:21.098
You remember, blonde, skinny,

13:21.099 --> 13:22.475
John Mayer wrote a song about her.

13:22.476 --> 13:24.563
Oh, yeah, I know Anna.

13:24.564 --> 13:26.776
Lauren, I gotta tell you, that
was some really good advice.

13:26.777 --> 13:29.489
And now maybe you'd like
some advice from me?

13:29.490 --> 13:31.159
Maybe about alternate hairstyles

13:31.160 --> 13:32.996
or different ways to style your hair?

13:32.997 --> 13:34.875
You know, I promised Peter
that I wouldn't use

13:34.876 --> 13:36.671
his tracking device, but what
am I supposed to do here?

13:36.672 --> 13:38.800
You have a tracking device
on Peter's phone?

13:38.801 --> 13:40.512
No, his thigh. What?

13:40.513 --> 13:42.056
They do it to zoo animals.

13:42.057 --> 13:45.271
Okay, what is at 22 West 4th Street?

13:45.272 --> 13:47.275
Oh, that's Anna's apartment.

[sighs]

17:00.913 --> 17:02.958
I've been thinking about
leaving the practice

17:02.959 --> 17:04.752
and getting Peter to replace me.

17:04.753 --> 17:06.965
He came over to my apartment
to work out the details.

17:06.967 --> 17:09.846
What? You were gonna leave the practice?

17:09.847 --> 17:11.809
Things have been so awkward with Jeremy

17:11.810 --> 17:13.521
ever since we broke up.

17:13.521 --> 17:15.942
I hate not being my normal,
easygoing self.

17:15.943 --> 17:17.403
So what? Suck it up.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.073
You can't just leave the practice

17:19.074 --> 17:20.867
'cause it's awkward
with some ex at work.

17:20.868 --> 17:22.705
That's, like, the story of my life.

17:22.707 --> 17:24.751
I like having another woman
working at the office.

17:24.752 --> 17:28.215
Plus, you're, like, my friend.

17:28.217 --> 17:29.803
Thank you.

17:29.804 --> 17:31.807
That's really nice.

17:31.808 --> 17:35.397
And I'm really sorry that
Ben went after your money.

17:35.398 --> 17:37.401
I know how important
money can be to people

17:37.402 --> 17:39.280
who didn't grow up with it.

17:39.281 --> 17:40.825
Yeah, I mean you went through
a divorce last year.

17:40.826 --> 17:42.161
How do I handle these negotiations?

17:42.162 --> 17:43.623
Negotiations?

17:43.624 --> 17:45.292
Why don't you just talk to Ben?

17:45.293 --> 17:47.087
Tim and I hammered it out
in one afternoon

17:47.088 --> 17:48.966
on our side-by-side ellipticals.

17:48.967 --> 17:52.014
Oh, no, my lawyer says
I shouldn't talk to him at all.

17:52.015 --> 17:54.435
You lawyer told you
to only talk to lawyers.

17:54.436 --> 17:56.189
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, seems like

17:56.190 --> 17:59.070
a pretty good way
to bill more hours, isn't it?

17:59.071 --> 18:01.157
You know what. I knew it, I knew it.

18:01.158 --> 18:02.952
I hate lawyers. First they tell me

18:02.953 --> 18:04.790
I can't come within 400 feet
of Carmelo Anthony,

18:04.791 --> 18:06.669
and now this.

18:06.670 --> 18:08.714
Okay, I better go talk to Ben.

18:08.715 --> 18:11.427
Good luck.

18:11.428 --> 18:13.181
You know, Anna, maybe we're lucky.

18:13.182 --> 18:15.102
We both got divorced from men

18:15.103 --> 18:17.231
that we weren't really in love with.

18:17.232 --> 18:20.237
Trust me, it's a lot harder to
break up with someone you love.

18:20.238 --> 18:22.242
Bye.

18:24.496 --> 18:27.292
[gasps]

18:27.293 --> 18:29.004
Okay, okay, I just heard a request

18:29.005 --> 18:31.426
for "Pearl Necklace" by ZZ Top.

18:31.427 --> 18:33.096
Excuse me, Karen.
I have to perform a gesture.

18:33.097 --> 18:34.891
- Get off the stage.
- Ow!

18:34.892 --> 18:37.897
Jeremy, I know that
you have moved on from me,

18:37.898 --> 18:40.402
but I have discovered that
I cannot move on from you.

18:40.403 --> 18:42.406
I think about the day
that I turned you down,

18:42.407 --> 18:45.120
and I'd do anything to have
another chance to answer you.

Oh, hello. Are you the clown

19:54.594 --> 19:55.970
to cheer up the patients in pediatrics?

19:55.971 --> 19:57.765
Obviously not.

19:57.766 --> 20:00.605
Although, yes, I do have
a scarf up my sleeve.

20:00.606 --> 20:02.190
But that's just because of static cling.

20:02.191 --> 20:03.484
I'm looking for Ben.

20:03.485 --> 20:05.280
Ben's in with a patient.

20:05.281 --> 20:06.909
You can sit in the waiting room
or just stand.

20:06.910 --> 20:08.913
Those shoes look so comfortable.

20:08.914 --> 20:10.918
Okay, that's enough.

20:13.005 --> 20:15.133
- Lindsay.
- Hey, Mindy.

20:15.134 --> 20:18.807
Hey, it's so great to see you.

20:18.808 --> 20:21.145
I just want to say I am really sorry

20:21.146 --> 20:23.651
that I'm not gonna be
your stepmom anymore.

20:23.652 --> 20:25.821
And I hope that what your dad
and I are going through

20:25.822 --> 20:28.368
doesn't hurt you too much,
because the truth is,

20:28.369 --> 20:30.246
I love you, and I think you're the best.

20:30.247 --> 20:31.833
Thanks.

20:31.834 --> 20:33.963
I heard my dad talking to the lawyer,

20:33.964 --> 20:36.718
and it seems like they were
asking for some money.

20:36.719 --> 20:38.597
Is it a lot?

20:38.598 --> 20:40.685
You know what? It doesn't matter.

20:40.686 --> 20:42.605
Because if it means
you get to have a nice life

20:42.606 --> 20:45.569
and go to college,
then it's money well spent.

20:45.570 --> 20:46.572
Come here.

20:48.618 --> 20:51.665
Oh, hey, and we can still
hang out, like, all the time.

20:51.666 --> 20:53.292
No, that's okay.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.296
I've been spending
a lot of time with my mom

20:55.297 --> 20:57.384
and my dad's new girlfriend, Vanessa.

20:57.385 --> 21:00.725
Exsqueeze me? There's a Vanessa already?

21:00.726 --> 21:02.729
Meanwhile, I had dinner with
Morgan three times last week,

21:02.730 --> 21:04.440
and I loved it.

21:04.441 --> 21:07.404
Vanessa's so cool.
She runs Reality at MTV.

21:07.405 --> 21:09.909
Okay, that's a cool job
if it's, like, 1987.

21:09.910 --> 21:12.080
Eh, anyway, I'm gonna let you
get back to your book.

21:12.081 --> 21:15.462
Oh, hey, Linds, please don't
unfollow me on Twitter.

21:15.463 --> 21:18.134
Yesterday @DollarsForFollowers
unfollowed me.

21:18.135 --> 21:19.721
I'm down to single digits.

21:19.722 --> 21:21.098
I won't unfollow you.

21:21.099 --> 21:23.436
Sweet, sweet girl.

21:23.437 --> 21:24.606
Bye, Linds.

21:24.607 --> 21:27.194
Bye.

21:27.195 --> 21:29.448
Dr. Lahiri, Ben's available bow.

21:29.449 --> 21:31.285
Not available romantically though.

21:31.286 --> 21:32.914
He's really serious with Vanessa.

21:32.915 --> 21:35.795
Actually, I don't need
to see Ben anymore.

21:35.796 --> 21:37.716
You can just tell him
I lost a lot of weight.

21:41.516 --> 21:44.562
Hey, Cliff, it's your
favorite ex-girlfriend.

21:44.563 --> 21:46.232
Well, that's not true.

21:46.233 --> 21:48.570
Fine, your favorite
non-white ex-girlfriend.

21:48.571 --> 21:51.117
That would be Agnes Choi
from high school.

21:51.118 --> 21:53.246
Okay, you know what, who cares?

21:53.247 --> 21:55.751
Just can you please tell me
how my divorce is going?

21:55.752 --> 21:57.547
Well, you know, normally
I don't get to say this,

21:57.548 --> 21:59.717
but I've actually got some good news.

21:59.718 --> 22:01.680
Apparently, you went
and spoke to Lindsay,

22:01.681 --> 22:03.474
who got her dad to back down.

22:03.475 --> 22:05.688
Wow, I tell you, even I've
never been cynical enough

22:05.689 --> 22:07.942
to go after the kid. I am impressed.

22:07.943 --> 22:10.363
Okay, it wasn't cynical.

22:10.364 --> 22:14.288
Lindsay and I shared
a really tender moment.

22:14.289 --> 22:17.920
Just goes to show you,
Cliff, that sometimes in law,

22:17.921 --> 22:20.049
the best way to get to people's heads

22:20.050 --> 22:21.636
is through their hearts.

22:21.637 --> 22:24.266
Yes, you have quite the legal mind.

22:24.267 --> 22:26.103
- Thank you.
- Get your feet off my desk.

22:26.104 --> 22:29.777
Well, either way,
I'm glad I was able to help.

22:29.778 --> 22:33.994
I just wish Danny's divorce
was going as easily as yours.

22:33.995 --> 22:36.666
Danny's getting divorced?

22:36.667 --> 22:38.587
No, I mean, not your Danny.

22:38.588 --> 22:42.010
No, it's a Danny... Italiano.

22:42.011 --> 22:44.014
That was terrible.
Look, just don't tell anybody.

22:44.015 --> 22:46.019
Oh, I won't tell a soul.
