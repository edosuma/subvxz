WEBVTT

00:03.711 --> 00:05.764
And it's another beautiful morning

00:05.788 --> 00:06.971
here in the southland.

00:06.995 --> 00:10.234
Clear and sunny skies
with the high for today of 78 degrees.

00:10.258 --> 00:13.238
Current temperature outside
is a crisp 60.

00:13.262 --> 00:15.814
Still no traffic problems
at this early hour.

00:15.838 --> 00:18.530
Clear cruising
on most of the major freeways,

00:18.554 --> 00:20.530
but watch out for construction
in the entrance

00:20.554 --> 00:23.196
to the 101 off Vine and Hollywood.

00:23.220 --> 00:25.414
Commuters headed
in that direction are advised

00:25.438 --> 00:27.851
to get out the door
a few minutes early.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.538
Fourth and Spring. No problem.

00:41.917 --> 00:44.977
- You see that sunrise?
- Yeah.

00:45.001 --> 00:46.961
Another day in paradise, right?

00:48.131 --> 00:50.645
- Not a morning person?
- Who is?

00:50.669 --> 00:53.392
Okay. Okay.
If you want my money, take it.

00:53.416 --> 00:55.054
It's not your money I want.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.514
Help! Help!

01:07.734 --> 01:08.849
Help me!

02:01.204 --> 02:02.758
I got it.

02:02.782 --> 02:04.592
Cowboy bar on Sunset.

02:04.616 --> 02:07.341
- With the mechanical bull?
- Yeah.

02:07.365 --> 02:10.604
No. Hetty plus mechanical bull
plus tequila equals bar fight.

02:10.627 --> 02:14.723
Trust me, I've been there.
Dom, is that a doll?

02:14.747 --> 02:19.196
Uh... Ha. No. This is one
of only 500 Alpha Centauri.

02:19.220 --> 02:22.152
Imperial Class Guardian Bobbleheads
in the entire world.

02:22.176 --> 02:24.568
It's not a doll.

02:24.592 --> 02:27.746
You're playing with an alien doll.
At work.

02:27.770 --> 02:31.201
There is a difference
between dolls and bobbleheads.

02:31.225 --> 02:34.663
And Imperial Class Alpha Centauris
are only part alien.

02:34.687 --> 02:37.319
The other part is cyborg.
I mean, everyone...

02:39.618 --> 02:41.610
- How about Disneyland?
- I hate Disneyland.

02:44.206 --> 02:46.673
- Kensi hates Disneyland.
- The happiest place on Earth?

02:46.697 --> 02:51.062
I have issues with grown men
in furry costumes.

02:51.086 --> 02:52.713
Unless it's Thursday night?

02:55.050 --> 02:57.599
- What are we talking about?
- Quality time with the team.

02:57.623 --> 02:59.736
Apparently it's been too long
since we hung out.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.234
Unless there's a corpse involved.

03:01.258 --> 03:05.299
- We're brainstorming ideas.
- Bowling. It's great competition.

03:05.811 --> 03:08.242
Builds camaraderie and you get
to wear those funny shoes.

03:08.266 --> 03:10.074
No bowling.

03:10.098 --> 03:13.914
Okay. What about the cowboy bar
on Sunset?

03:13.938 --> 03:16.245
Oh, that sounds like fun.

03:16.269 --> 03:18.545
They have a mechanical bull, Hetty.

03:18.569 --> 03:21.824
Oh, no. Never mind.

03:24.246 --> 03:27.970
Mr. Callen,
you received an e-mail this morning.

03:27.994 --> 03:31.749
More specifically,
Jason Tedrow received an e-mail.

03:32.671 --> 03:33.869
Who's Jason Tedrow?

03:35.173 --> 03:36.881
Alias from an old case.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.684
I don't remember it.

03:39.708 --> 03:41.606
You're on assignment
in Afghanistan.

03:41.630 --> 03:45.695
- A case that now involves all of us.
- Why is that?

03:45.719 --> 03:49.475
Because the man who sent you
the e-mail was killed two hours ago.

03:50.647 --> 03:54.074
Cabby's name was Joey Gale,
former Navy systems technician.

03:54.098 --> 03:56.291
- How'd he end up driving a cab?
- Four years ago,

03:56.315 --> 04:00.294
we took Gale and accomplices down for
pulling an electronic heist of $5 million

04:00.318 --> 04:02.838
from the Naval Advanced Defence
Research fund.

04:02.862 --> 04:04.445
Gale was the inside guy.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.744
Huh. Montrell Perez.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.894
- He's the crew's leader.
- Sociopath with gang ties.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.330
- Fourth Street Flats.
- Flats?

04:13.837 --> 04:16.707
Rough boys. Tightknit.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.730
- Jon Donnelly.
- No prior record.

04:19.754 --> 04:22.274
Bunked with Perez
who dragged him into it.

04:22.298 --> 04:24.796
- How'd you catch him?
- Deep-cover op.

04:25.307 --> 04:28.153
I went in as Jason Tedrow,
a dirty MP.

04:28.177 --> 04:29.952
Spent months getting close to them.

04:29.976 --> 04:31.698
Told them I knew they'd taken
the money

04:31.722 --> 04:34.542
and that I could use my connections
to sabotage the investigation.

04:34.566 --> 04:37.164
They believed me, I asked for a cut.

04:37.188 --> 04:40.622
And on the day of the payoff,
NCIS arrested all of us.

04:40.646 --> 04:46.005
Now, Gale and Donnelly struck up
a deal to testify against Perez.

04:46.029 --> 04:48.255
They each did four years
and got released,

04:48.279 --> 04:50.258
but Perez wasn't so lucky.

04:50.282 --> 04:53.683
He's doing a 10-year stretch at the
Naval Consolidated Brig at Miramar.

04:53.707 --> 04:57.304
So where does this crew think
their buddy Tedrow ended up?

04:57.328 --> 04:59.604
Shipped off to a brig
in South Carolina.

04:59.628 --> 05:01.851
- And the 5 million?
- Gone.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.688
Gale used his access
to transfer the money

05:03.712 --> 05:05.902
from the fund to an outside account.

05:05.926 --> 05:07.817
But money was gone
from the outside account

05:07.841 --> 05:09.510
when the investigators got access.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.950
Gale and the rest of them
passed lie-detector tests.

05:11.974 --> 05:14.327
They had no idea
where that money went.

05:14.351 --> 05:16.515
NCIS got the convictions
that they wanted,

05:16.858 --> 05:18.328
but the $5 million was never found.

05:18.352 --> 05:21.420
Which leads us back to the e-mail
Gale sent Jason Tedrow.

05:21.444 --> 05:23.747
Right. Now, Gale's been
tracking down the money

05:23.771 --> 05:26.213
since he was paroled
three weeks ago.

05:26.237 --> 05:27.785
He found an account number,

05:28.411 --> 05:30.713
now he wants Jason Tedrow's help
getting it.

05:30.737 --> 05:33.297
Why get in touch with someone
he hasn't seen for so long?

05:33.321 --> 05:34.911
I'm just a naturally likeable guy.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.875
- He was desperate.
- Could be a little of both.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.348
Given their history,
Gale must've thought Tedrow

05:40.372 --> 05:42.102
was one of only people
he could trust.

05:42.126 --> 05:44.269
- Honour among thieves.
- Gale connected the money

05:44.293 --> 05:45.524
to a shell corporation,

05:45.548 --> 05:48.401
but the account was closed
approximately two hours ago.

05:48.425 --> 05:51.528
Right around the time
that this happened.

05:51.552 --> 05:54.264
This is the traffic cam on the corner.

06:04.656 --> 06:07.419
He tossed the murder weapon
so he wouldn't be caught with it.

06:07.443 --> 06:09.835
It wasn't a mugging,
it was an execution.

06:09.859 --> 06:11.720
Someone knew he's getting close
to money.

06:11.744 --> 06:13.597
Kensi, head down to the brig
at Miramar.

06:13.621 --> 06:16.435
- Find out what Perez knows.
- And if Perez has ties to the Flats,

06:16.459 --> 06:18.974
then he's a suspect.
Could've ordered the hit from prison.

06:18.998 --> 06:20.724
All right, on my way.

06:20.748 --> 06:24.267
- Where's Jon Donnelly?
- Paroled three weeks ago like Gale,

06:24.291 --> 06:28.737
but no driver's licence, no utility bills,
no credit cards. Off the grid.

06:28.761 --> 06:30.638
I'll find him.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.717
How is our old friend
Jason Tedrow?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.374
It's just another alias, Hetty.

07:22.398 --> 07:24.536
An alias that reminds me

07:24.560 --> 07:28.128
of something Theodore Roethke
once wrote.

07:28.152 --> 07:32.297
My soul,
Like some heat-maddened summer fly,

07:32.321 --> 07:38.247
Keeps buzzing at the sill. Which I is I?

07:38.750 --> 07:41.264
- Well, I've been a lot of people.
- Yes.

07:41.288 --> 07:45.375
But you enjoyed
being Jason Tedrow best.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.812
It bothers me too, Mr. Hanna.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.643
He's going lone wolf on us.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.483
Keep an eye on him.

08:09.406 --> 08:13.652
- He's good at spotting tails.
- And you're good at running them.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.637
Stay close.

08:15.661 --> 08:20.537
Lone wolf or not,
Mr. Callen is one of our own.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.522
Oh, my God.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.611
- Jason.
- Hi.

08:51.656 --> 08:52.735
Been a while.

08:54.826 --> 08:59.737
- Mom.
- Jason, this is Michael. My son.

09:04.335 --> 09:05.960
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:25.080 --> 09:29.385
What is this? You think you can
just waltz back into my life?

09:29.409 --> 09:32.810
- Thought you'd be glad to see me.
- You disappeared.

09:32.834 --> 09:34.664
I was in prison.

09:35.090 --> 09:37.142
That's not an excuse.

09:37.166 --> 09:38.622
You didn't even say goodbye.

09:39.761 --> 09:42.442
Would've made it harder.
Didn't want you to deal with this too.

09:42.466 --> 09:47.016
The only person who decides
what I am fit to deal with is me.

09:47.352 --> 09:51.480
I've dealt with plenty
and I'm doing just fine.

09:52.607 --> 09:55.063
- I'm looking for your brother.
- Jon?

09:55.693 --> 09:58.944
He's still a lost cause.
Figures you'd be looking for him.

09:59.364 --> 10:02.091
- Kristin.
- In the kitchen.

10:02.115 --> 10:04.382
- Hey, big guy.
- Come here.

10:04.406 --> 10:06.012
How are you?

10:06.036 --> 10:10.581
Jason Tedrow,
this is Tommy Boyd, my fiancé.

10:12.502 --> 10:15.171
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.371
Jason's an old friend of Jon's.

10:19.426 --> 10:20.706
He was just leaving.

10:29.060 --> 10:32.405
- You're getting married?
- I met him right after you vanished.

10:32.429 --> 10:34.574
You thought
I was just gonna wait for you?

10:34.598 --> 10:35.598
No.

10:37.068 --> 10:40.354
No, I get it.

10:43.116 --> 10:44.337
Last I heard,

10:44.361 --> 10:47.083
Jon was hanging out in front
of the Supply Depot in East L.A.

10:47.107 --> 10:49.220
Just looking to pick up odd jobs.

10:49.244 --> 10:51.490
Trying to make ends meet.

10:54.461 --> 10:56.868
- Thanks.
- Jason.

10:59.382 --> 11:03.925
I've moved on.
Please, don't come back.

11:21.404 --> 11:23.776
You know I spotted your tail a half mile
into my drive.

11:24.365 --> 11:25.373
If you spotted me,

11:25.397 --> 11:27.294
- you would've tried to shake me.
- Uh-huh.

11:27.318 --> 11:30.387
It was that leapfrog manoeuvre
on Olympic that gave you away.

11:30.411 --> 11:31.778
You wish.

11:33.750 --> 11:34.757
What?

11:34.781 --> 11:37.248
Got involved with Jon Donnelly's
sister during the case?

11:39.589 --> 11:42.317
She was never a suspect or a witness.
Okay? It was deep cover.

11:42.341 --> 11:45.426
I just used her to gain the trust
of her brother's crew.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.035
Okay.

11:52.059 --> 11:54.242
So I got close to her.

11:54.266 --> 11:55.658
She doesn't know my real name.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.740
The man she fell in love
with doesn't exist.

11:57.764 --> 12:00.324
- What about the kid?
- He was never a suspect either,

12:00.348 --> 12:01.997
but he did seem a little shifty.

12:02.021 --> 12:04.437
Who's the kid's father?

12:07.825 --> 12:09.617
I don't know.

12:15.166 --> 12:18.250
- Need you to log in, please.
- Thanks.

12:25.718 --> 12:28.565
- Agent Blye, NCIS.
- That's me.

12:28.589 --> 12:31.360
Lieutenant Commander Neil Corby,
JAG.

12:31.384 --> 12:34.013
- Montrell Perez is my client.
- And?

12:35.770 --> 12:37.904
You're assuming I have conditions?

12:37.928 --> 12:40.264
We arrested him.
You defended him.

12:40.650 --> 12:43.520
And our relationship is adversarial
by nature.

12:48.491 --> 12:50.839
I need something, you have it.

12:50.863 --> 12:53.218
Namely the cooperation of my client.

12:53.242 --> 12:56.555
Quid pro quo.
I scratch your back, you scratch mine.

12:56.579 --> 12:59.620
Easy now, Agent Blye. We just met.

13:01.254 --> 13:02.392
What do you want?

13:02.416 --> 13:05.649
I'm petitioning the court of appeals
for reduction in my client's sentence.

13:05.673 --> 13:07.976
I'd appreciate the support of NCIS
at the hearing.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.276
I will see what I can do.

13:10.300 --> 13:11.823
Much obliged.

13:11.847 --> 13:16.012
So now, let's scratch your itch.

13:21.608 --> 13:24.121
Keep it down, Taylor.

13:24.145 --> 13:26.062
Here comes our boy.

13:31.242 --> 13:33.235
I ain't gay.

13:36.539 --> 13:38.366
You don't know.

13:41.502 --> 13:44.266
- You smell her?
- Counsellor, put a leash on your client

13:44.290 --> 13:45.543
or I'll do it myself.

13:45.965 --> 13:47.566
Agent Blye is prepared to help us

13:47.590 --> 13:49.858
get you out of here earlier
than planned, Montrell.

13:49.882 --> 13:52.045
All you have to do
is answer some questions.

13:52.639 --> 13:54.216
For this piece, I'll do it for free.

13:55.058 --> 13:56.635
Joey Gale is dead.

13:56.976 --> 13:58.518
And not from natural causes?

13:58.895 --> 14:00.495
Gunned down in the street
this morning.

14:00.519 --> 14:02.182
Well, I hope it hurt.

14:04.525 --> 14:06.435
I didn't do it. Ha-ha-ha.

14:07.820 --> 14:09.919
Yeah, but you're tight
with people who could.

14:09.943 --> 14:11.798
Prison records show
you made a dozen calls

14:11.822 --> 14:14.482
to Fourth Street Flats members
over the last month.

14:14.994 --> 14:16.797
Ain't no crime to phone home.

14:16.821 --> 14:19.238
- What about Jon Donnelly?
- Well, I hope he's next.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.851
Gale and Donnelly turned on me.

14:21.875 --> 14:24.058
- Karma's a bitch.
- Montrell.

14:24.082 --> 14:26.685
Please stop making yourself a suspect
in this case.

14:26.709 --> 14:29.015
- Knock it off.
- Haven't had visitor in a long time.

14:29.039 --> 14:31.968
- Let me try to work this out, man.
- Okay, we're done.

14:32.303 --> 14:34.023
Okay, okay, okay.

14:34.047 --> 14:36.274
Call me, huh?
I ain't going anywhere.

14:36.298 --> 14:38.513
Maybe we could go on a date.

14:44.982 --> 14:46.536
Package for you.

14:46.560 --> 14:48.502
From a JAG lawyer.

14:48.526 --> 14:50.663
- Corby.
- You read the card.

14:50.687 --> 14:52.084
Well, for security purposes.

14:52.108 --> 14:54.583
You know, national security,
classified document protocol.

14:54.607 --> 14:57.215
He doesn't have clearance
to know about this location.

14:57.239 --> 15:01.966
Well, he sent them through central
NCIS mail dispatch in San Diego.

15:01.990 --> 15:03.636
In record time.

15:03.660 --> 15:05.329
I hate flowers.

15:09.716 --> 15:11.126
Give him points for trying.

15:37.952 --> 15:40.443
- Here we go.
- I'll handle it.

15:42.623 --> 15:44.746
This crowd can smell a cop
a mile away.

15:45.460 --> 15:46.716
I smell like a cop?

15:46.740 --> 15:49.303
You smell like powder,
but that's a different conversation.

15:49.327 --> 15:50.964
What?

15:51.549 --> 15:53.376
You're scaring me.

16:08.065 --> 16:09.394
Jon.

16:11.277 --> 16:12.451
Jon.

16:12.475 --> 16:14.148
Jon.

16:15.698 --> 16:17.323
I just wanna talk.

16:18.493 --> 16:19.583
God.

16:19.607 --> 16:22.383
Jeez, are you trying
to get yourself killed?

16:22.407 --> 16:24.549
I'm trying to stop myself
from getting killed.

16:24.573 --> 16:26.552
- You all right?
- I heard about Gale.

16:26.576 --> 16:28.162
Thought maybe I was next.

16:29.545 --> 16:31.977
Haven't seen anyone run that fast
since that time you got caught

16:32.001 --> 16:33.892
with that Marine's girlfriend
in San Diego.

16:33.916 --> 16:35.526
That guy was a knuckle dragger.

16:35.550 --> 16:38.185
Only reason I ran is because
you broke the land speed record

16:38.209 --> 16:41.472
getting out of the bar after you realised
he had buddies with him.

16:43.267 --> 16:45.059
It's good to see you.

16:50.566 --> 16:53.792
This where you tell me I look good for
a guy who did 48 months in the brig?

16:53.816 --> 16:55.896
- I'm a thief, I'm not a liar.
- Heh.

16:57.406 --> 16:58.984
How'd you find me?

17:03.037 --> 17:04.496
Kristin.

17:05.205 --> 17:07.412
Bet she was glad to see you.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.328
Well, not as much as I'd hoped.

17:11.587 --> 17:13.141
I saw the report on Gale
this morning...

17:13.165 --> 17:17.016
And you heard it was a botched
mugging and thought I'd killed him.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.936
- I didn't say that.
- Don't feel bad.

17:18.961 --> 17:20.844
I thought the same thing about you.

17:22.013 --> 17:23.840
So that 5 million's still missing,
isn't it?

17:24.224 --> 17:25.885
I don't know anything
about the money.

17:26.853 --> 17:30.103
I just know I don't wanna be looking
over my shoulder the rest of my life.

17:31.983 --> 17:33.691
Do you think Perez
could've done this?

17:34.652 --> 17:35.731
He's a sick bastard.

17:36.445 --> 17:38.877
When I was locked up,
every time I talked to my sister,

17:38.901 --> 17:41.694
she made a point of asking
if I'd heard from you.

17:43.119 --> 17:45.028
You broke her heart pretty bad.

17:48.207 --> 17:49.701
I made a mistake.

17:50.084 --> 17:51.305
You're damn right.

17:51.329 --> 17:54.432
And to make up for it,
you're going to call my little sister

17:54.456 --> 17:56.290
and apologise
for all the things you did...

18:04.056 --> 18:05.764
Jon. Jon.

18:22.072 --> 18:24.539
This is the security cam
from Jet Plastics.

18:24.563 --> 18:27.256
No plates. Guy in a mask.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.006
No way to ID the driver.

18:29.030 --> 18:31.553
Gale and Donnelly are both dead.

18:31.577 --> 18:33.682
That leaves Montrell Perez.

18:33.706 --> 18:36.581
Guy in the SUV didn't take a shot
at Jason Tedrow.

18:37.379 --> 18:38.411
Why not?

18:40.633 --> 18:42.008
Callen?

18:43.052 --> 18:44.594
Callen?

18:45.054 --> 18:46.299
You okay?

18:51.602 --> 18:54.887
Jason Tedrow didn't show up
as a player until the end.

18:56.023 --> 18:57.162
Gale and Donnelly knew more.

18:57.186 --> 18:59.291
Or he was trying to shoot you too
and he missed.

18:59.315 --> 19:01.952
Well, Gale and Donnelly both testified
against Perez in court.

19:01.976 --> 19:03.957
He hated them for that.

19:03.981 --> 19:06.374
He could buy himself
a Fourth Street Flats hit squad

19:06.398 --> 19:09.007
for a whole lot less than $5 million.

19:09.031 --> 19:11.824
All right. I'll take another shot at him.

19:13.082 --> 19:15.288
Thought you hated flowers.

19:19.505 --> 19:22.647
I pulled up everything on
Kristin Donnelly's fiancé, Tommy Boyd.

19:22.671 --> 19:24.893
- And?
- Whew. Skeletons in the closet.

19:24.917 --> 19:27.643
Five years at Folsom State Prison
for armed robbery.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.444
Served his full sentence,
released in 2002.

19:30.468 --> 19:32.633
Anyone think Kristin's got a thing
for bad boys?

19:36.480 --> 19:37.654
And moving on.

19:37.678 --> 19:40.121
Boyd's records show an incident
where he was a minor.

19:40.145 --> 19:42.001
Underage drinking and a DUI.

19:42.025 --> 19:45.337
He was acquitted, but the details
of the case were sealed by the court.

19:45.361 --> 19:46.941
Work with Eric. Get it unsealed.

19:56.083 --> 19:58.632
Kristin has no idea
she's marrying an ex-con.

19:58.656 --> 20:01.505
- You don't know that.
- I know her.

20:02.089 --> 20:03.607
She'd never go down that path again.

20:03.631 --> 20:06.231
Not your place to look out for her.
She's part of this case.

20:06.255 --> 20:08.715
Oh, and Boyd just drops into her life
after I leave?

20:09.179 --> 20:10.697
It could be a coincidence.

20:10.721 --> 20:13.380
Somebody dropped the hammer
on Gale and Donnelly.

20:13.809 --> 20:15.861
Now, Perez making hits
from prison?

20:15.885 --> 20:18.445
That's a good theory.
It's not the only theory.

20:18.469 --> 20:22.491
Do you think it's Boyd?
Or do you want it to be Boyd?

20:22.515 --> 20:26.773
Sam, just as you said, I'll be okay.

20:36.832 --> 20:39.014
- What is this?
- I was thinking Ping-Pong.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.644
Ping-Pong.

20:40.668 --> 20:43.184
More specifically, a Ping-Pong night.

20:43.208 --> 20:44.934
Oh, yeah. For the team outing.

20:44.958 --> 20:48.025
And not to brag or anything,
but I'm really good.

20:48.049 --> 20:50.294
Fortunately for you, it's easy to pick up.
Come on.

20:54.892 --> 20:55.923
Serve it up.

21:02.441 --> 21:03.900
There you go.

21:04.902 --> 21:08.187
- How's the case?
- Callen wants to work alone.

21:08.739 --> 21:11.336
Ah. Behaviour that conflicts
with the fundamental tenets.

21:11.360 --> 21:14.238
Teamwork.

21:14.620 --> 21:17.762
One of the fundamental tenets
of G. Callen is to tackle things solo.

21:17.786 --> 21:19.592
It's the way he makes sense
of the world.

21:19.616 --> 21:21.310
He's been doing it his whole life.

21:21.334 --> 21:23.210
You debrief him after every case.

21:23.504 --> 21:24.962
You know what's not in the files.

21:25.839 --> 21:28.935
- And that's all you're gonna say?
- That's all I can say.

21:28.959 --> 21:32.396
If it affects NCIS,
it's my job to speak up,

21:32.420 --> 21:35.489
but as far as the innermost thoughts
of the field agents are concerned,

21:35.513 --> 21:39.265
it's my job to make sure
that they stay confidential.

21:41.188 --> 21:43.430
He trusts you more
than anyone else, Sam.

21:45.943 --> 21:48.244
What if he doesn't need my help
this time?

21:48.268 --> 21:50.438
You'll be ready to offer it anyway.

21:52.908 --> 21:55.695
What about the girl?
Kristin Donnelly.

21:58.914 --> 22:01.037
Nothing he can't handle.

22:08.298 --> 22:10.481
Did I mention I have
one of the sickest topspin serves

22:10.505 --> 22:12.360
- you've ever seen?
- No.

22:12.384 --> 22:14.106
- Ready?
- Sure.

22:14.130 --> 22:16.131
- Free lesson?
- Yeah.

22:19.101 --> 22:21.319
Yeah. Yeah, I just gotta
warm up next time.

22:21.343 --> 22:24.781
Because I got...
I have this rotator cuff thing.

22:24.805 --> 22:27.449
You ever get that? Like, in the gym?

22:27.473 --> 22:28.682
Probably not.

22:29.778 --> 22:32.732
Beat your ass at Pictionary.

22:34.867 --> 22:36.574
Thank you, sir.

22:38.370 --> 22:40.161
Right this way, ma'am.

22:40.998 --> 22:44.616
- This isn't a social call.
- How did you guess?

22:45.419 --> 22:47.850
The flowers weren't nice enough
to warrant a same-day visit.

22:47.874 --> 22:52.269
I hate flowers,
but the gesture didn't go unnoticed.

22:52.293 --> 22:54.602
What branch of NCIS
are you with anyway?

22:54.626 --> 22:56.321
I made an inquiry

22:56.345 --> 22:59.633
and got hit with the kind of clearance
request you'd expect from Langley.

23:01.518 --> 23:03.012
There's been another shooting.

23:04.146 --> 23:07.811
Jon Donnelly. We think Montrell Perez
may have had something to do with it.

23:08.609 --> 23:10.019
May I ask why?

23:11.153 --> 23:13.916
I can think
of about 5 million reasons.

23:13.940 --> 23:16.047
A less tactful attorney might suggest

23:16.071 --> 23:18.969
your efforts are better spent
trying to locate this alleged hit man

23:18.993 --> 23:22.588
rather than assigning blame
to a prisoner already serving his time.

23:22.612 --> 23:24.473
Perez is a legitimate suspect.

23:24.497 --> 23:26.884
And if you still want us
to support his appeal,

23:26.908 --> 23:28.805
he needs to tell us
everything he knows.

23:28.829 --> 23:30.878
Oh, he told me
he'd talk to you anytime.

23:32.674 --> 23:34.050
So long as it's face-to-face.

23:34.593 --> 23:36.467
And they say chivalry is dead.

23:39.556 --> 23:41.276
Just run it through
my office first, okay?

23:41.300 --> 23:43.763
Of course.
Thank you for the flowers.

23:44.811 --> 23:46.519
You said you didn't like flowers.

23:47.397 --> 23:49.805
I kind of like that you sent them.

24:07.167 --> 24:08.341
What are you doing here?

24:08.365 --> 24:11.141
- Kristin doesn't know, does she?
- Know what?

24:11.165 --> 24:12.974
That you got sent
to Folsom State Prison

24:12.998 --> 24:15.854
for a liquor store robbery
that left the owner paralysed.

24:15.878 --> 24:19.277
Look, I was 18.
I'm not the guy who pulled the trigger.

24:19.301 --> 24:23.338
And it takes a hell of a lot more
than talking like a cop to rattle me.

24:28.939 --> 24:32.913
Look, she'll leave me if she finds out.

24:32.937 --> 24:35.897
She's had it with people
who disappoint her.

24:37.406 --> 24:39.030
How'd you meet?

24:40.659 --> 24:42.046
At a bar.

24:42.070 --> 24:44.711
- Look, what do you want from me?
- I want you to convince me

24:44.735 --> 24:47.724
that you had nothing to do
with Jon Donnelly's murder.

24:47.748 --> 24:49.173
Look, that liquor store thing,

24:49.197 --> 24:51.641
I was a kid caught up
with the wrong crowd, all right?

24:51.665 --> 24:54.055
It's not an excuse.
It's what happened.

24:54.079 --> 24:57.043
But I served every day
of my sentence.

24:58.885 --> 25:00.878
- We all make mistakes.
- Yeah.

25:01.346 --> 25:02.805
We do.

25:03.140 --> 25:06.888
But one mistake I'll never make
is walking out on Kristin.

25:09.396 --> 25:11.851
It's more than I can say for you.

25:12.899 --> 25:14.773
Whoever you are.

25:31.043 --> 25:34.079
- At least he didn't shoot you.
- There is that.

25:36.548 --> 25:39.086
You mind explaining how this visit
is connected to our case?

25:40.802 --> 25:42.356
Is my partner interrogating me?

25:42.380 --> 25:44.463
Your partner's watching your back.

25:47.642 --> 25:50.216
Something's wrong with this guy.
It's just...

25:50.729 --> 25:52.365
He's got some demons.

25:52.389 --> 25:54.307
Don't we all?

25:55.734 --> 26:00.028
He said he met Kristin in a bar,
but it just feels like there's more to it.

26:01.365 --> 26:03.523
Then there probably is.

26:04.826 --> 26:07.993
But he does seem to care
about Kristin and the boy.

26:10.499 --> 26:12.242
I don't know.

26:12.626 --> 26:16.754
Four years ago, walking away
seemed like the right thing to do,

26:18.465 --> 26:21.134
but I told her so many lies.

26:22.886 --> 26:24.985
The deeper you get,

26:25.009 --> 26:30.008
the easier it is to leave the lies
in place and just disappear.

26:33.063 --> 26:36.396
The best thing you can do
is find the man who killed her brother.

26:52.455 --> 26:54.887
So I got a call
from Miramar naval brig.

26:54.911 --> 26:59.935
Perez just got a visit from
Andres Rodrigo a.k.a. Icey Andres.

26:59.959 --> 27:01.730
He's a Fourth Street Flats enforcer

27:01.754 --> 27:05.766
who is a prime suspect in,
I don't know, eight homicides.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.436
Now, unfortunately,
police can't make anything stick

27:08.460 --> 27:10.820
due to the fact
that witnesses against Señor Icey

27:10.844 --> 27:14.574
tend to suffer from such maladies
as unnatural strangulation,

27:14.598 --> 27:16.572
untimely dismemberment,

27:16.596 --> 27:19.499
and unfortunate spills
down empty elevator shafts.

27:19.523 --> 27:22.917
Am I the only one thinks he delivers
that information a little too cheerfully?

27:22.941 --> 27:24.166
Hey, don't hate.

27:24.190 --> 27:25.417
I love my job.

27:25.441 --> 27:27.878
Question Perez again,
but don't tell his lawyer.

27:27.902 --> 27:29.948
Let's see how he does
without coaching.

27:30.452 --> 27:32.634
Go behind Corby's back?

27:32.658 --> 27:34.844
Intrigue. Betrayal.
This is getting good.

27:34.868 --> 27:38.622
Sometimes, he's so cheerful
I just wanna punch him. Repeatedly.

27:39.043 --> 27:41.855
Since Corby said
Perez will see you anytime,

27:41.879 --> 27:43.244
then he doesn't need to know.

27:43.882 --> 27:47.024
Have another sit-down, smile a lot,
look like you're interested.

27:47.048 --> 27:48.523
Oh, be still, my beating heart.

27:48.547 --> 27:51.483
Another chance to hear
the latest penitentiary pick-up lines.

27:51.507 --> 27:54.230
We dress you in something tight.

27:54.254 --> 27:56.901
He will be so bewitched
and bothered,

27:56.925 --> 28:01.397
he won't even notice
when you plant this little bug on him.

28:09.574 --> 28:11.317
Nice.

28:11.659 --> 28:15.254
- You put that on just for me?
- Sure, I did.

28:15.278 --> 28:18.372
Jon Donnelly was killed in a drive-by
shooting this afternoon.

28:20.084 --> 28:21.804
Tragic.

28:21.828 --> 28:24.185
You're the only one in that
crew that isn't dead

28:24.209 --> 28:27.772
and you don't seem to be too scared
about being next.

28:27.796 --> 28:29.627
Scared?

28:30.178 --> 28:32.823
Right. I'm a big dog in here.

28:32.847 --> 28:34.639
Untouchable.

28:36.518 --> 28:37.893
To most.

28:43.358 --> 28:45.813
Do you like having me here?

28:47.820 --> 28:51.272
Then give me something I can use
or I'm gone.

28:52.659 --> 28:54.485
Well, what do you wanna know?

28:55.370 --> 28:57.113
What happened to the money
you stole?

29:00.124 --> 29:03.493
- Off the record?
- Sure.

29:08.091 --> 29:10.167
We stole 5 mil.

29:10.718 --> 29:13.066
Four-point-five
of which I never saw again.

29:13.090 --> 29:14.816
What happened to the difference?

29:14.840 --> 29:18.027
In a bank. Got my name on it.

29:18.051 --> 29:21.310
I'm gonna tell you something
I haven't told anybody before.

29:21.563 --> 29:23.685
Not even that JAG lawyer
of mine, Corby.

29:24.399 --> 29:27.826
Four years ago, the night
before the trial, I got a phone call.

29:27.850 --> 29:31.040
Guy on the other end was wearing
one of those voice distorter things.

29:31.064 --> 29:33.611
He told me I was going down.

29:34.826 --> 29:39.488
But I could walk away with some cash
if I did my time, kept my mouth shut.

29:39.914 --> 29:42.452
Do you have any idea
who it might've been?

29:44.627 --> 29:47.390
Could've been any
of a dozen guys I knew.

29:47.414 --> 29:49.474
Bunch of my old Flats boys.

29:49.498 --> 29:52.544
Maybe even this bent MP
named Tedrow.

29:53.219 --> 29:55.864
Gale and Donnelly said they got
calls too. They told the guy no.

29:55.888 --> 29:59.140
Thought they'd do their time,
get out, find the money.

29:59.434 --> 30:01.343
Guess they were wrong.

30:04.063 --> 30:06.768
- Is that all?
- For today.

30:07.483 --> 30:10.413
- You think I'm coming back?
- Yeah.

30:10.437 --> 30:11.726
I sure do.

30:12.280 --> 30:14.735
It'll be like Silence of the Lambs,

30:15.283 --> 30:17.880
only you're hotter than the FBI chick

30:17.904 --> 30:20.615
and I'm a lot smarter
than the creepy, old killer guy.

30:29.756 --> 30:30.787
Call me.

30:32.717 --> 30:35.777
Our killer started working on his plan
four years ago.

30:35.801 --> 30:39.588
He spoke to Perez and the others
before the trial.

30:40.808 --> 30:44.094
Sounds like he had inside information
on the case.

30:44.437 --> 30:45.979
Yep.

30:47.190 --> 30:49.657
You promised you'd run all visits
with Perez through me first.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.432
Oh, I'm sorry. Someone must've
screwed up at the office.

30:53.780 --> 30:55.997
Munro, what is it with you, man?
You jealous?

30:56.021 --> 30:58.796
- I'm trying to kick it to this hot agent.
- In your dreams.

30:58.820 --> 31:01.009
You saw the way
she touched my shoulder, man.

31:01.033 --> 31:02.318
- She...
- Perez?

31:04.123 --> 31:06.116
Perez. Get a medic now.

31:09.379 --> 31:11.252
Kensi, get back in there.

31:21.391 --> 31:23.276
- His pulse is fading fast.
- What happened?

31:23.300 --> 31:26.406
- He started choking and collapsed.
- Perez.

31:26.430 --> 31:28.074
Perez, who was the man
on the phone?

31:28.098 --> 31:30.728
Perez, who took the money?

31:35.154 --> 31:36.648
Kensi?

31:37.949 --> 31:39.776
It's too late.

31:40.660 --> 31:41.667
He's dead.

31:41.691 --> 31:45.760
Initial toxicology results indicate
that Perez was poisoned.

31:45.784 --> 31:47.391
Sodium cyanide.

31:47.415 --> 31:50.264
It's a colourless salt
that induces cardiac arrest.

31:50.288 --> 31:53.972
Slip it into someone's food or drink
and it could take hours to kill them.

31:53.996 --> 31:56.462
I've got something
on Kristin Donnelly's fiancé.

31:56.884 --> 31:59.482
Remember that sealed case
on Tommy Boyd's record?

31:59.506 --> 32:01.315
- The DUI he got as a minor?
- Yeah.

32:01.339 --> 32:04.219
I finally managed to access
the court records and get it unsealed.

32:05.393 --> 32:07.408
Tommy was acquitted
due to a technicality.

32:07.432 --> 32:10.664
His court-assigned lawyer discovered
an error in the arrest paperwork

32:10.688 --> 32:13.158
and got the prosecutor
to seal the case.

32:13.182 --> 32:15.067
That's pretty good
for a public defender.

32:15.361 --> 32:18.362
Yeah. It was Neil Corby.

32:33.544 --> 32:35.679
Corby's a former Navy petty officer.

32:35.703 --> 32:37.434
After graduating law school,

32:37.458 --> 32:40.063
he went the public-defender route
for four years,

32:40.087 --> 32:42.643
then decided he was a military man
at heart.

32:42.667 --> 32:44.648
Next stop was JAG.

32:44.672 --> 32:46.923
Perez said he didn't tell anyone
about phone call,

32:47.308 --> 32:49.028
but Corby knew about it.

32:49.052 --> 32:53.521
So either Perez was lying to me,
trying to make me feel special,

32:53.982 --> 32:56.307
or Corby knows more about this case
than he's letting on.

33:00.238 --> 33:02.230
I hate flowers.

33:36.983 --> 33:38.916
- You and Neil Corby.
- And don't hold back.

33:38.940 --> 33:41.659
Bring him to lay a beating on me,
is that what this is?

33:41.683 --> 33:43.523
Corby.

33:44.282 --> 33:48.125
He saved my ass on a DUI charge
when I was 17. I owed him.

33:48.149 --> 33:49.632
I kept in touch.

33:49.656 --> 33:51.430
From the way my life was headed,

33:51.454 --> 33:53.591
I figured I could use a lawyer
who was a buddy.

33:53.615 --> 33:57.219
And four years ago,
he called in the favour.

33:57.243 --> 33:59.851
- He wanted me to get close to a girl.
- Kristin Donnelly.

33:59.875 --> 34:02.100
The woman you supposedly met
in a bar.

34:02.124 --> 34:04.399
I did. He told me where she'd be
and he sent me in.

34:04.423 --> 34:07.357
- Why?
- To keep tabs on her brother Jon.

34:07.381 --> 34:09.440
Apparently he just got sent to prison.

34:09.464 --> 34:11.905
Corby seems to think he might've
known about some money,

34:11.929 --> 34:15.659
but as far as I could tell, Jon didn't
know anything and neither did Kristin.

34:15.684 --> 34:16.946
And you fell for her.

34:16.969 --> 34:21.561
When she told me she was pregnant,
I figured it was meant to be.

34:22.862 --> 34:25.708
Her and that boy, they're my family.

34:25.733 --> 34:28.232
I mean,
it doesn't matter how it started.

34:29.034 --> 34:30.992
They're all I care about now.

34:33.498 --> 34:35.704
Is she in some kind of danger
from Corby?

34:36.333 --> 34:39.168
- No.
- Why should I believe you?

34:39.670 --> 34:41.543
You're not the only one
that cares about her.

34:53.893 --> 34:55.197
Corby represented Perez in trial.

34:55.221 --> 34:57.328
He had inside information
about what went down.

34:57.352 --> 34:59.324
Got to the money,
switched to another account.

34:59.348 --> 35:02.501
Got nervous Donnelly might find out so
he hired Boyd to keep an eye on it.

35:02.525 --> 35:04.935
In the end, it was Joey Gale
who put it all together.

35:05.947 --> 35:08.520
- We'd better talk to Kensi.
- Yeah.

35:16.290 --> 35:19.682
Train Number 241,
direct service to San Juan Capistrano

35:19.706 --> 35:22.368
is now boarding on Platform 12.

35:30.221 --> 35:32.379
- Hi.
- Hey.

35:33.099 --> 35:34.427
Thanks.

35:34.851 --> 35:37.638
Well, thank you for meeting me.

35:37.979 --> 35:40.221
I have to apologise.

35:41.065 --> 35:42.476
I'm very sorry about Perez.

35:43.151 --> 35:46.187
Well, this isn't exactly the way
I envisioned our first date, but...

35:50.032 --> 35:51.443
The case has hit a dead-end.

35:53.327 --> 35:55.711
There was another guy
who got arrested four years ago.

35:55.735 --> 35:58.036
A crooked MP, Jason Tedrow.

35:58.833 --> 36:00.552
Yeah, I read his name
in the case file.

36:00.576 --> 36:02.056
He got released from Charleston.

36:02.080 --> 36:05.764
- All right, I'll check him out.
- I already did. Several times.

36:05.788 --> 36:07.898
Every time I went to Charleston
to visit clients

36:07.922 --> 36:10.986
over the past four years,
I made it a point to try to meet him.

36:11.010 --> 36:13.942
One time, the warden told me
Tedrow was in the infirmary.

36:13.966 --> 36:16.192
Another time,
Tedrow was on work duty.

36:16.216 --> 36:18.277
He was even in solitary once.

36:18.301 --> 36:20.493
With Jason Tedrow,
it was always something.

36:20.517 --> 36:21.743
The man's like a ghost.

36:21.767 --> 36:25.284
So now that he's out,
you can see why I've taken an interest.

36:25.308 --> 36:28.461
Yes. It certainly does
sound suspicious.

36:28.485 --> 36:30.196
It does.

36:31.449 --> 36:36.763
I started considering all the possibilities
with Tedrow and I landed on this one.

36:36.787 --> 36:40.133
There's this story
that's passed around the JAG guys,

36:40.157 --> 36:42.764
NCIS has an undercover operator

36:42.788 --> 36:45.890
who can turn himself into anyone
at any time for any reason.

36:45.914 --> 36:48.104
Gets his man and he's gone.

36:48.128 --> 36:50.731
Like some urban legend.
Doesn't even have a real name.

36:50.755 --> 36:52.884
Just Callen.

36:54.013 --> 36:56.255
Yeah, I'm not a huge fan
of urban legends.

36:57.391 --> 37:00.534
I know there was an undercover
NCIS element

37:00.558 --> 37:02.353
involved in the case four years ago.

37:03.648 --> 37:08.986
I think Jason Tedrow and Callen
are the same guy.

37:09.445 --> 37:13.004
Which means
you are wearing a wire

37:13.028 --> 37:16.425
and he is listening
to every word of this.

37:16.449 --> 37:19.655
So either he shows his face
right now,

37:20.248 --> 37:24.411
or I pull the trigger and leave you
bleeding out all over that seat.

37:26.295 --> 37:28.122
Corby.

37:28.589 --> 37:30.392
Tommy?

37:30.416 --> 37:32.560
- Why is Boyd here?
- What are you doing?

37:32.584 --> 37:35.986
I followed you from your house.
I'm making sure you don't hurt Kristin.

37:36.010 --> 37:37.864
She doesn't even know
where the money is.

37:37.888 --> 37:40.191
- Turn around and walk away.
- Look, whatever favour

37:40.215 --> 37:41.803
I owed you, is paid.

37:42.186 --> 37:45.033
- It's not that easy.
- Yeah? I figured you'd say that.

37:45.057 --> 37:47.437
He's got a gun!

37:53.948 --> 37:56.949
You wanna shoot a federal agent?
You go right ahead.

38:02.582 --> 38:03.826
Let her go.

38:04.458 --> 38:06.285
Get down.

38:14.468 --> 38:17.232
You're okay. Hang in there.
I got you. Hang in there. Hang in there.

38:17.256 --> 38:19.387
You're okay. You're all right.

38:20.099 --> 38:22.317
It's not that bad.
You'll be okay. Come on.

38:22.341 --> 38:23.597
Ambulance is on the way.

38:26.022 --> 38:27.053
That's him, isn't it?

38:29.150 --> 38:30.181
Callen.

38:31.277 --> 38:32.652
I've never heard of him.

38:43.247 --> 38:44.278
Hang in there.

38:46.917 --> 38:49.871
- I had to protect her.
- You did.

38:50.588 --> 38:53.293
I win, right?

39:09.023 --> 39:12.747
I don't know this Jason Tedrow guy,
but he's becoming a pain in my ass.

39:12.771 --> 39:13.975
Is he retired now?

39:15.071 --> 39:16.695
Almost.

39:22.536 --> 39:25.027
- Good job.
- Thanks.

39:29.168 --> 39:32.015
Congratulations are in order.

39:32.039 --> 39:36.756
Jason Tedrow has officially ridden off
into the sunset.

39:40.805 --> 39:42.489
What about Kristin?

39:42.513 --> 39:44.555
She has her son, Michael.

39:46.560 --> 39:49.976
- Is there anything you don't know?
- Plenty.

39:50.648 --> 39:54.942
But whether such things are worth
knowing, however, is debatable.

39:56.529 --> 39:57.809
What do I do?

40:00.491 --> 40:02.816
Ask yourself a question.

40:03.202 --> 40:06.345
Which I is I?

40:06.369 --> 40:08.803
Then tell her the truth.

40:08.827 --> 40:11.870
I'm certain she'll return the favour.

40:14.588 --> 40:16.248
Which truth?

40:17.925 --> 40:20.333
The one that sets you free.

40:31.063 --> 40:33.079
- What are you drawing?
- Hi.

40:33.103 --> 40:35.065
Looks good.

40:40.781 --> 40:43.295
- Hi.
- I'm sorry for showing up, I just...

40:43.319 --> 40:45.128
I probably should've called.

40:45.152 --> 40:47.285
Why start now?

40:48.080 --> 40:49.087
How's Tommy?

40:49.111 --> 40:51.366
Doctors say he
can come home tomorrow.

40:53.836 --> 40:55.034
He's a good man.

40:57.214 --> 40:58.874
Yes, he is.

41:09.435 --> 41:10.763
Michael's not your son.

41:14.815 --> 41:18.730
I should've told you the moment
you came back, but I was so angry.

41:21.280 --> 41:22.798
I wanted you to wonder.

41:22.822 --> 41:26.324
I wanted you to suffer like I had
after you left.

41:27.411 --> 41:29.202
I was wrong.

41:32.541 --> 41:34.498
One last thing, l...

41:38.297 --> 41:40.290
My real name...

41:42.468 --> 41:47.213
Goodbye, Jason.

42:11.789 --> 42:13.248
Bye.

42:27.263 --> 42:28.733
We were waiting on you.

42:28.757 --> 42:30.390
Why?

42:30.641 --> 42:32.195
The team outing, remember?

42:32.219 --> 42:34.196
Dom made reservations.

42:34.220 --> 42:36.352
Do I even wanna know
what he chose?

42:36.814 --> 42:38.012
I chose.

42:38.566 --> 42:41.851
I hope you all enjoy karaoke
as much as I do.

42:42.278 --> 42:45.943
But if not, deal with it.

42:46.323 --> 42:47.782
Come on.

42:48.742 --> 42:50.378
You don't have to.

42:50.402 --> 42:52.012
And miss the opportunity to show up

42:52.036 --> 42:54.885
your pathetic Mick Jagger
impersonation with my Springsteen?

42:54.909 --> 42:58.509
- Not a chance.
- You? Springsteen? This I gotta hear.

42:58.533 --> 43:00.229
- Where's Dom?
- I don't know.

43:00.253 --> 43:02.685
- Meeting us there, I guess.
- Bet he doesn't show.

43:02.709 --> 43:04.684
Bet he's got himself
a hot date instead.

43:04.708 --> 43:07.267
Guess he'll just have to hear you
some other time, Hetty.

43:07.291 --> 43:09.153
What are you gonna sing?

43:09.177 --> 43:12.074
I thought a little Ella Fitzgerald.

43:12.098 --> 43:16.513
I've been told I sound just like her.
