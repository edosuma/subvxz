WEBVTT

00:03.305 --> 00:07.708
You can't stop any of us. We can't
be killed, you stupid little chew toys.

00:10.212 --> 00:11.804
These are smarter than you.

00:11.980 --> 00:14.710
You don't have a clue how to kill them
or slow them down.

00:14.917 --> 00:16.680
And your plan is go right at them?

00:18.620 --> 00:20.679
- We've been busy.
- Hunting Leviathan.

00:21.223 --> 00:22.952
You met Dick yet?

00:23.191 --> 00:26.718
I'd sooner swim through garbage than
shake hands with a mutation like you.

00:26.895 --> 00:28.192
I'd never work with you.

00:28.363 --> 00:30.695
I hate the bastards. Squash them all.

00:32.100 --> 00:34.227
You need to see Frank Devereaux.

00:34.469 --> 00:37.233
Bobby Singer sent us. Or not. Who?

00:37.406 --> 00:39.601
We need you to get us
further off the grid...

00:39.775 --> 00:41.333
...but keep us on the board.

00:41.510 --> 00:43.239
Wipe all your old aliases.

00:43.412 --> 00:47.508
Change your phones on a very frequent,
non-schedule schedule, you understand?

00:48.016 --> 00:50.280
You can't just tell me you're fine.

00:50.485 --> 00:51.747
- Be honest?
- Yeah.

00:51.920 --> 00:54.388
I don't like lying to you.
It doesn't feel right.

00:54.556 --> 00:56.615
Got me there.
I've been climbing the walls.

00:56.792 --> 00:58.054
I know how that is.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.267
Good night, sweetie.

01:49.077 --> 01:54.572
<i>This is Nature
Sounds' "Sounds of Nature," Volume 4.</i>

01:54.750 --> 01:56.843
<i>"Soothing Seas."</i>

02:18.273 --> 02:20.366
What the hell?

02:25.981 --> 02:27.107
Leanne!

02:34.356 --> 02:35.789
No.

02:36.491 --> 02:38.083
No. Stay away.

02:38.593 --> 02:39.719
Leanne!

02:46.735 --> 02:50.398
<i>This is
Nature Sounds' "Sounds of Nature."</i>

03:02.651 --> 03:04.084
Did you strip enough wire?

03:04.252 --> 03:05.685
Yes, I stripped enough wire.

03:08.657 --> 03:09.817
All right.

03:20.001 --> 03:21.628
See? Told you.

03:29.177 --> 03:31.372
Well, isn't this cozy?

03:31.680 --> 03:36.174
Yeah. Well, Motel 6
just ain't leaving the light on anymore.

03:36.351 --> 03:39.514
Well, I'm taking a page
out of Frank Devereaux's bible on this.

03:39.688 --> 03:42.953
Everybody is out to get you.
Paranoia is just plain common sense.

03:43.158 --> 03:46.093
Weeks, guys. Weeks.

03:46.261 --> 03:49.196
We've been living with cold showers,
cold Hot Pockets.

03:49.364 --> 03:52.959
Cold everything. This is the bottom
that we're living in. You get that?

03:53.168 --> 03:55.068
How many big mouths are out there?

03:55.237 --> 03:56.898
Running card traces, like Chet...

03:57.072 --> 03:59.768
...or hunting us down
God knows what ways?

03:59.941 --> 04:03.206
No. Now is not the time to be
laying our bed rolls out on the grid.

04:03.378 --> 04:04.402
Not if we can help it.

04:08.550 --> 04:10.780
That's just great.

04:13.622 --> 04:15.249
This is stupid.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.653
I mean, our quality of life is crap.

04:17.826 --> 04:22.091
We got purgatory's least wanted
everywhere...

04:22.297 --> 04:24.993
<i>...and we're on our third
The World's Screwed issue...</i>

04:25.200 --> 04:28.431
...in three years. We've steered the bus
away from the cliff...

04:28.603 --> 04:30.594
...twice already.
Someone's gotta do it.

04:30.772 --> 04:34.071
- What if the bus wants to go over?
- The world wants to end?

04:34.242 --> 04:37.575
I think if we didn't take its belt
and all its pens away each year...

04:37.746 --> 04:40.510
...the whole enchilada
would have offed itself already.

04:40.715 --> 04:43.013
Stop trying to wrestle
with the big picture, son.

04:43.218 --> 04:44.776
You're gonna hurt your head.

04:46.488 --> 04:48.683
So, what's the guff?

04:48.857 --> 04:51.951
Well, uh, there have been
a rash of sightings...

04:52.127 --> 04:53.685
...all over the southern Pine Barrens.

04:53.862 --> 04:56.126
A strange, fast-moving,
human-like creature.

04:56.298 --> 04:58.027
Locals even have a name for it.

04:59.467 --> 05:02.698
"Jersey Devil"? I thought
that was just local tall-tale crap.

05:02.871 --> 05:06.034
The area's history of sightings
goes back more than two centuries.

05:06.241 --> 05:11.440
Some accounts gave it bat wings,
others, uh, horns, uh, a tail...

05:13.248 --> 05:14.875
...and, oh, yeah, a horse's head.

05:16.651 --> 05:19.552
The sketch looks
more like a Chewbacca head.

05:19.754 --> 05:21.312
- Sounds kind of mixed up.
- Yeah.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.719
Like it should be fighting
a Japanese robot.

05:23.892 --> 05:27.760
Well, mixed up or not, it sounds like
it might just have a body count.

05:30.165 --> 05:33.862
"Camping high season
harshed by human burrito"?

05:34.035 --> 05:36.560
Yeah. Something hung a camper up
in a tree...

05:36.771 --> 05:39.296
...then ate him alive
right through his sleeping bag.

05:39.474 --> 05:41.874
His wife hasn't been seen either.

05:42.043 --> 05:45.240
Plus four other missing-persons reports
in the last three weeks.

05:45.413 --> 05:48.644
State troopers, get this,
are saying it's a rogue bear.

05:48.817 --> 05:52.048
When was the last time you saw a bear
string up its own piÃ±ata?

05:52.220 --> 05:54.085
Something is out there in the woods.

05:54.723 --> 05:57.715
Hey, we're going
honest-to-goodness wilderness hunting.

05:57.893 --> 05:59.861
Haven't used my thirty-thirty
in a while.

06:00.028 --> 06:02.861
Davy Crockett, safari is gonna have
to wait till tomorrow.

06:03.031 --> 06:06.159
After our suit-and-tie dance.
We'll make sure this is not just...

06:06.334 --> 06:10.202
...some backwoods crackhead
who likes to roll glampers.

06:10.372 --> 06:12.033
What the hell is a glamper?

06:12.207 --> 06:13.401
Sam?

06:14.576 --> 06:16.043
High-end camper.

06:16.211 --> 06:18.543
TV, a.c., Wi-Fi.

06:18.713 --> 06:21.079
Back to nature, zero inconvenience.

06:21.249 --> 06:23.615
- That's idiotic.
- Yeah.

06:23.818 --> 06:26.116
Some people just don't know
how to live.

06:33.328 --> 06:35.057
So, Ranger Evans...

06:35.230 --> 06:37.596
Oh, uh, you can call me Rick.

06:37.766 --> 06:38.858
Ranger Rick.

06:40.735 --> 06:42.362
Heh, uh...

06:42.537 --> 06:45.472
You were the one who found
Mitchell Rayburn, correct?

06:45.640 --> 06:47.403
The human burrito.

06:49.110 --> 06:51.101
State police have it down
as a bear attack.

06:54.382 --> 06:56.646
Yeah, I read what the state police says.

06:56.851 --> 06:58.716
That was no rogue brown.

06:58.887 --> 07:03.449
Apparently, some others reported seeing
something a little, you know, weirder.

07:03.625 --> 07:06.116
You know,
I've been a ranger for 12 years.

07:06.294 --> 07:11.596
Tell you the truth,
we have no idea what's out there.

07:11.766 --> 07:16.499
Big, a lot of trees and whatnot.

07:16.671 --> 07:17.763
Tell you this, though.

07:18.306 --> 07:20.240
You gotta respect Mother Nature.

07:20.408 --> 07:23.104
You respect her,
or she's gonna string you up...

07:23.278 --> 07:26.247
...and she'll eat your ass
right through the Gore-Tex.

07:26.781 --> 07:29.272
So you're thinking it's Mother Nature?

07:29.451 --> 07:30.509
See, me and Phil...

07:31.186 --> 07:35.122
...we've been finding,
uh, something's leftovers for weeks.

07:35.690 --> 07:38.420
Deer remains, uh, badger...

07:38.693 --> 07:39.990
...missing pets.

07:40.161 --> 07:41.253
Who's Phil?

07:41.429 --> 07:44.330
Uh, assistant chief ranger.

07:45.500 --> 07:49.095
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen Phil in a couple of days.

07:50.438 --> 07:54.033
He's supposed to call
from whatever station he's checking off.

07:54.209 --> 07:56.769
You think maybe
your assistant chief ranger...

07:56.945 --> 07:58.037
...might be missing?

07:58.213 --> 08:00.613
I should probably report that.

08:04.519 --> 08:05.850
Excuse us.

08:06.021 --> 08:12.290
Well, you enjoy your lunch,
Ranger Rick.

08:18.700 --> 08:19.724
So?

08:19.934 --> 08:22.164
Well, I took a look at the cadaver.

08:22.337 --> 08:23.861
What's left of it.

08:24.039 --> 08:25.199
Not a happy camper.

08:26.641 --> 08:29.041
Don't have any stats
on a Jersey Devil...

08:29.210 --> 08:31.974
...but the bite radius
on the vic's wounds...

08:32.147 --> 08:33.808
...it's too small for a Leviathan.

08:33.982 --> 08:36.712
And he's still got a ventricle
and some change...

08:36.885 --> 08:39.217
...so I doubt we're talking werewolf.

08:39.386 --> 08:42.150
And a Wendigo don't leave no scraps.

08:42.323 --> 08:43.381
Hmm.

08:43.558 --> 08:44.650
Lunch?

08:44.826 --> 08:45.884
Starving.

08:46.061 --> 08:49.224
Hey, uh, Brandon. We grab a booth?

08:49.397 --> 08:52.855
Hey, uh, douchewad,
a hostess will seat you.

08:53.034 --> 08:54.865
Do I look like a freaking hostess?

08:55.603 --> 08:58.731
Do you wanna look like a hostess?

09:02.544 --> 09:04.739
That didn't really make sense,
what you said.

09:04.913 --> 09:07.006
What was that?

09:07.182 --> 09:10.208
I sure hope
we don't get Brandon's section.

09:10.919 --> 09:13.911
Sidewinder soup and salad combo goes
to Big Bird.

09:14.789 --> 09:16.586
TDK Slammer to Ken doll.

09:17.492 --> 09:19.392
A little heart smart for creepy uncle.

09:20.128 --> 09:23.689
- What is your problem?
- You are my problem!

09:26.367 --> 09:29.131
Oh, Brandon has got his flare all up
in a bunch.

09:29.304 --> 09:32.273
Yeah. There goes his 18 percent. Heh.

09:32.440 --> 09:35.739
Anyway, chief ranger? I don't think
he believes in the Jersey Devil.

09:35.910 --> 09:40.609
Oh, by the way,
did he seem a little stoned to you?

09:41.149 --> 09:42.377
Ranger Rick?

09:42.550 --> 09:44.950
Yeah. Definitely growing his own
on the back 40...

09:45.120 --> 09:46.553
...and smoking all the profits.

09:49.290 --> 09:51.724
He did seem to think
that there was something.

09:51.893 --> 09:53.053
Oh, that is good sandwich.

09:53.228 --> 09:55.025
What the hell did you get?

09:56.297 --> 10:00.427
New Pepperjack Turducken Slammer,
limited time only.

10:00.602 --> 10:03.799
Bunch of birds
shoved up inside each other.

10:03.972 --> 10:05.599
Shouldn't play God like that.

10:05.773 --> 10:09.072
Don't look at me sideways from
that Chinese chicken geezer salad.

10:09.244 --> 10:10.302
This is awesome.

10:10.845 --> 10:14.406
Like the perfect storm
of your top three edible birds.

10:17.252 --> 10:22.155
Anyways, the ranger did seem to think
there was something in Wharton Forest.

10:22.323 --> 10:24.450
- I'd say it's safari time.
- She's big-boned.

10:24.626 --> 10:26.787
Look at her.
You're telling me she's not fat?

10:26.961 --> 10:28.929
- Hey.
- No. Up yours, Mike.

10:29.097 --> 10:31.156
Shove it right up yours.

10:34.102 --> 10:38.596
Well, anyway,
back to bigger and better things.

11:12.473 --> 11:14.600
Couple of bucks.

11:14.909 --> 11:16.809
Head-butting over turf, probably.

11:16.978 --> 11:19.208
Pretty sure the other fella won.

11:28.823 --> 11:30.313
I guess I forgot.

11:30.491 --> 11:34.552
Before you were a hunter,
you were actually a hunter.

11:34.729 --> 11:38.165
Yeah, well,
we shot our dinner when I was a kid.

11:38.333 --> 11:40.494
You used to take us hunting.
Remember?

11:40.668 --> 11:43.034
Dad had a case,
he'd just dump us on you.

11:43.204 --> 11:45.695
You taught us
most of the outdoor tracking we know.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.431
Yeah, what I could get to stick.

11:49.077 --> 11:52.046
I never could get you little grubs
to pull a trigger on a single deer.

11:52.213 --> 11:53.771
You're talking about Bambi, man.

11:53.948 --> 11:56.041
You don't shoot Bambi, jackass.

11:57.452 --> 11:58.851
You shoot Bambi's mother.

12:09.664 --> 12:11.689
Well, looks like we found Phil.

12:19.707 --> 12:20.799
Special agents.

12:22.310 --> 12:24.244
Listen, I got your call.

12:24.412 --> 12:26.812
But I'm not sure
I got what you were saying.

12:31.619 --> 12:34.213
Hey. I think we found Phil.

12:34.389 --> 12:36.220
That's what I said.

12:36.391 --> 12:38.723
Heh.
Uh, I should probably call this in.

12:41.963 --> 12:43.897
Yeah, yeah. Solid move, Rick.

12:55.610 --> 12:57.009
Uh, this is Ranger Evans...

12:57.211 --> 12:59.406
...up at Acher's Point. Come in.

12:59.947 --> 13:03.075
Repeat. This is Chief Ranger Evans.

13:03.251 --> 13:04.275
<i>Go ahead.</i>

13:04.452 --> 13:06.147
I have a situation at Acher's Point.

13:07.588 --> 13:09.852
Ranger, I think we've got company.

13:10.024 --> 13:11.491
Yeah? Who's that?

13:12.360 --> 13:13.793
Whoa!

13:14.128 --> 13:15.755
Ranger!

13:17.532 --> 13:19.727
Ranger Evans!

13:20.802 --> 13:22.531
Ranger!

13:28.009 --> 13:29.874
It's got him up in the trees.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.940
- Lights off.
- What?

13:36.117 --> 13:40.383
- You think that's really a good idea?
- Shut up, shut off, and listen.

13:47.562 --> 13:49.359
Damn thing is eating Rick.

13:49.530 --> 13:50.690
Man, I liked Rick.

14:08.383 --> 14:10.544
Wow, nice shot, Bobby.

14:10.718 --> 14:11.912
Seriously.

14:12.086 --> 14:14.281
We all got our gifts.

14:26.567 --> 14:28.831
What about the rest of Ranger Rick?

14:29.704 --> 14:31.763
Ranger called in his 10-20.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.702
His own will find him.

14:33.875 --> 14:35.433
We got crap to do.

14:48.389 --> 14:51.950
Built like a supermodel, but the thing
was strong. That's for sure.

14:52.126 --> 14:54.856
Carried a full-grown man up a tree
in nothing flat.

14:55.029 --> 14:57.293
But it only took one bullet
to bring it down.

14:57.465 --> 15:01.595
And not even a silver bullet,
just a "bullet" bullet.

15:13.848 --> 15:16.043
First one must have just stunned it.

15:18.085 --> 15:23.421
All right, well,
let's check its Hulk pants for some ID.

15:26.627 --> 15:30.859
Ugh,
that is just gonna ruin the leather.

15:33.935 --> 15:35.732
Are you feeling okay?

15:35.903 --> 15:37.302
Yeah. I feel great.

15:38.272 --> 15:43.904
Gerald Browder, lived here in town,
5-foot-9, brown hair, blue eyes...

15:44.579 --> 15:45.876
...235 pounds.

15:46.981 --> 15:48.073
Whoa.

15:49.617 --> 15:52.245
Well, apparently, he's lost a little pudge.

15:55.790 --> 15:59.658
Maybe it's a lap band side effect.
Ha.

16:16.477 --> 16:18.604
What the hell?

16:19.046 --> 16:22.777
I think we better have a look
under Gerald's hood.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.520
God.

16:27.688 --> 16:30.555
His organs are swimming in the stuff.

16:30.725 --> 16:32.192
You guys getting hungry?

16:34.295 --> 16:35.523
I'm hungry.

16:37.965 --> 16:39.159
What's that?

16:39.333 --> 16:41.392
His stomach.

16:41.569 --> 16:44.800
For a guy on a diet,
Gerry here packed it in pretty good.

16:44.972 --> 16:46.496
That's human right there.

16:46.674 --> 16:48.869
That's fresh Rick.

16:49.043 --> 16:50.135
Let's see.

16:50.311 --> 16:52.142
Plus...

16:53.948 --> 16:55.210
A pine cone.

16:57.752 --> 16:59.982
A pack of gum in the wrapper.

17:03.591 --> 17:07.857
That's older. Maybe like, uh...
Maybe Ranger Phil or the camper.

17:08.029 --> 17:09.394
What's that?

17:09.564 --> 17:10.758
It looks like a...

17:10.964 --> 17:12.762
Yeah, that's a cat's head.

17:15.569 --> 17:17.094
A glamper or two is one thing...

17:17.271 --> 17:19.933
...but you gotta be damn hungry
to eat a cat's head.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.506
Mm-hm.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.113
Well, lookit here.

17:27.281 --> 17:29.772
I'm no Dr. Oz...

17:31.052 --> 17:33.885
...but I think that's his adrenal glands.

17:34.055 --> 17:35.113
Okay. And?

17:35.289 --> 17:38.690
Meant to be the size
of hotel bar soap...

17:38.859 --> 17:40.486
...and bright orange.

17:41.996 --> 17:43.691
Ugh.

17:43.864 --> 17:45.627
That might help explain the strength.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.428
Uh, but whatever this is,
it's not the Jersey Devil...

17:48.603 --> 17:51.094
...but it sure as hell ain't Gerald Browder
anymore.

17:51.539 --> 17:53.507
Okay, guys, seriously.

17:55.309 --> 17:56.776
It's time for dinner.

18:04.885 --> 18:10.221
Gerald Browder, 35, self-employed.
Air conditioning repairman.

18:10.391 --> 18:13.155
Missing person number three.
Disappeared eight days ago.

18:13.327 --> 18:16.956
Well, that explains all the people
who got eaten in the last eight days.

18:17.131 --> 18:20.225
Yeah.
Question is, what happened to him?

18:31.545 --> 18:32.603
Dean.

18:32.780 --> 18:34.077
Uh...

18:34.248 --> 18:35.738
So, what do you think?

18:35.916 --> 18:37.611
I'm not that worried about it.

18:37.785 --> 18:39.650
Excuse me?

18:40.421 --> 18:42.616
That's funny, right?

18:42.857 --> 18:45.291
I could give two shakes of a rat's ass.

18:46.427 --> 18:47.917
Is that right?

18:48.095 --> 18:51.087
Do rats shake their ass
or is it something else?

18:52.133 --> 18:53.600
Eh.

19:17.725 --> 19:20.023
- Give me that.
- Whoa, whoa, why?

19:20.194 --> 19:25.689
There's some funky chicken
in the TDK Slammer, ain't there?

19:26.233 --> 19:27.700
Yeah.

19:30.404 --> 19:31.996
This is stupid.

19:32.173 --> 19:34.004
My sandwich didn't do anything.

19:34.175 --> 19:36.507
I don't know what you think
you're gonna find.

19:36.977 --> 19:38.604
There's something wrong with you.

19:40.514 --> 19:42.141
Are you kidding? I'm fine.

19:44.552 --> 19:46.349
Pfft. I actually feel great.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.817
The best I've felt in a couple months.

19:50.991 --> 19:52.891
Cass, black goo.

19:53.494 --> 19:55.052
I don't even care anymore.

19:55.229 --> 19:58.426
And you know what's even better?
I don't care that I don't care.

20:01.836 --> 20:05.101
- I just want my damn Slammer back.
- Dude, you are completely stoned.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.534
Just like Ranger Rick was.

20:06.707 --> 20:09.198
Just like the dinner rush
back at Biggerson's.

20:09.376 --> 20:12.504
And everybody is loving
the Turducken.

20:14.849 --> 20:16.749
I think you pissed off my sandwich.

20:22.690 --> 20:24.089
That's in me?

20:24.258 --> 20:25.555
Only half of it.

20:25.726 --> 20:27.591
Does that snot look familiar?

20:28.162 --> 20:31.222
Okay, so whatever turned Gerry Browder
into a pumpkin head...

20:31.398 --> 20:33.923
- ...and is turning Dean into an idiot...
- I'm here.

20:34.101 --> 20:35.591
Right here.

20:35.770 --> 20:38.466
Is in the Turducken Slammer
at Biggerson's.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.299
- Yeah.
- It's in the meat.

20:43.310 --> 20:46.746
If I wasn't so chilled out right now,
I would puke.

20:55.990 --> 20:57.787
How's he doing?

21:02.062 --> 21:03.586
He's sleeping it off.

21:04.064 --> 21:06.396
Tryptophan coma.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.995
So you think he's okay?

21:09.203 --> 21:10.568
Yeah, he's all right.

21:10.738 --> 21:11.966
Good.

21:12.573 --> 21:13.835
You don't worry about him?

21:14.008 --> 21:17.068
What, you mean before the Turducken?

21:17.244 --> 21:23.183
Yeah. Yeah, I kind of mean
more like ever since my head broke.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.612
And we lost Cass.

21:24.785 --> 21:28.312
I mean, you ever feel like he's going
through the same motions...

21:28.489 --> 21:30.184
...but he's not the same Dean?

21:30.357 --> 21:32.951
- How could he be?
- Right, yeah.

21:33.127 --> 21:36.119
- But what if...?
- What if what, Sam?

21:37.231 --> 21:39.324
You know, you worry about him.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.195
All he does is worry about you.

21:41.368 --> 21:43.859
Who's left to live their own life here?

21:44.271 --> 21:45.329
The two of you.

21:45.506 --> 21:48.498
Aren't you full up just playing
Snuffleupagus with the devil...

21:48.676 --> 21:50.337
...all the live long?

21:53.681 --> 21:56.878
I don't know, Bobby.
Seeing Lucifer is fine with me.

21:57.952 --> 21:59.681
Come again?

22:00.521 --> 22:01.681
I'm not saying it's fun.

22:01.856 --> 22:06.225
I mean, to be honest with you,
I kind of see it as the best-case scenario.

22:06.393 --> 22:07.826
I mean, heh...

22:09.463 --> 22:12.762
...at least all my crazy
is under one umbrella, you know?

22:13.300 --> 22:15.996
I mean,
I kind of know what I'm dealing with.

22:16.170 --> 22:18.297
A lot of people got it worse.

22:20.374 --> 22:22.808
You always were
one deep little son of a bitch.

22:24.211 --> 22:25.371
Wait, wait, wait.

22:25.546 --> 22:27.309
Here we go.

22:53.374 --> 22:55.308
Well, I guess we follow it.

23:42.756 --> 23:45.122
That's weird, right?

23:45.426 --> 23:47.792
National franchise getting meat
from a place...

23:47.962 --> 23:51.261
...that looks
like it wholesales Hong-Kong knockoffs.

23:51.432 --> 23:52.797
Okay, yeah.

23:52.967 --> 23:54.264
It's a little weird.

23:54.435 --> 23:57.563
All right, well, I guess
we wait till they close up shop...

23:57.738 --> 23:59.000
...go take a look around.

24:00.574 --> 24:01.632
Hang on.

24:10.484 --> 24:11.974
No.

24:22.930 --> 24:24.192
Edgar.

24:26.100 --> 24:27.294
Leviathans.

24:35.109 --> 24:37.043
Son of a bitch.

24:37.211 --> 24:39.645
What the hell is going on?

24:49.790 --> 24:52.816
Put him with the others,
if you don't mind.

24:54.995 --> 24:56.360
Edgar.

24:56.530 --> 24:58.191
Follow me.

24:58.732 --> 25:02.224
I've been so busy with this experiment,
I didn't realize you were back.

25:02.436 --> 25:04.131
It's, uh, big stuff.

25:04.304 --> 25:06.135
I'm back because of the experiment.

25:06.306 --> 25:09.571
What's happening?
You said you were refining the formula.

25:09.743 --> 25:11.040
Yes. Absolutely.

25:11.211 --> 25:12.371
And it's going great.

25:12.546 --> 25:14.707
Absorption rate is up,
lower concentrations.

25:14.882 --> 25:17.373
Didn't solve our little issue
with adverse reactions.

25:17.551 --> 25:19.314
Well, no.

25:19.486 --> 25:21.351
Not a hundred percent.

25:34.601 --> 25:35.761
Burn them.

25:36.603 --> 25:37.695
What?

25:37.871 --> 25:39.998
But they represent crucial test data.

25:40.174 --> 25:43.769
Where the additive formula went wrong,
where my initial projections failed.

25:43.977 --> 25:45.410
Dick is coming.

25:49.550 --> 25:51.211
Burn them.

26:01.428 --> 26:03.362
<i>Nothing happening back here.</i>

26:03.797 --> 26:04.889
Yeah, okay, Sam.

26:05.065 --> 26:07.363
They're pretty dug in,
so you finish circling...

26:07.534 --> 26:09.434
<i>...and head on back.
Right.</i>

26:12.506 --> 26:13.803
How's your head?

26:15.742 --> 26:17.733
Well, I think the Slammer has wore off.

26:17.911 --> 26:21.438
In between that and 20 cups of coffee,
I'm nicely tense and alarmed.

26:21.615 --> 26:24.015
I wasn't talking about that.

26:25.652 --> 26:29.110
Oh, Bobby, don't go all Sigmund Freud
on me right now, okay?

26:29.289 --> 26:31.052
I just got drugged by a sandwich.

26:31.225 --> 26:34.456
I wanna talk
about your new party line.

26:34.761 --> 26:35.819
Party line?

26:36.730 --> 26:38.960
What are you talking about?
I don't even vote.

26:39.133 --> 26:40.998
The world is a suicide case.

26:41.168 --> 26:43.636
We save it, it just steals more pills.

26:43.804 --> 26:46.830
Bobby, I'm here, okay?
I'm on the case. What's the problem?

26:47.040 --> 26:51.739
I've seen hunters live and die. You're
starting to talk like the dead ones.

26:51.912 --> 26:55.780
No, I'm talking the way a person talks
when they've had it.

26:55.949 --> 26:59.350
When they can't figure out
why they used to think all this mattered.

26:59.553 --> 27:01.111
Oh, you poor, sorry...

27:03.257 --> 27:04.918
You're not a person.

27:05.092 --> 27:07.322
- Thanks.
- Come on, now.

27:07.494 --> 27:11.794
All right. You tried to hang it up
and be a person with Lisa and Ben.

27:11.965 --> 27:15.662
And now here you are with a mean
old coot and a van full of guns.

27:15.836 --> 27:17.861
That ain't person behavior, son.

27:18.071 --> 27:19.470
You're a hunter.

27:19.640 --> 27:22.165
Meaning you're whatever the job
you're doing today.

27:22.342 --> 27:24.139
You get a case of the Anne Sextons...

27:24.311 --> 27:27.109
...something's gonna come up
and rip your fool head off.

27:27.281 --> 27:30.614
Now, you find your reasons
to get back in the game.

27:30.784 --> 27:33.776
I don't care if it's love or spite
or a 10-dollar bet.

27:33.954 --> 27:36.514
I've been to enough funerals.
I mean it.

27:39.293 --> 27:42.228
You die before me, and I'll kill you.

27:45.299 --> 27:49.292
We need to scrape some money
together, get you a condo or something.

27:49.469 --> 27:52.370
Hey. Something's up.

28:05.152 --> 28:08.053
Well, I'll be a squirrel in a skirt.

28:08.488 --> 28:10.513
It's Dick frigging Roman.

28:11.625 --> 28:13.354
Who the hell is Dick frigging Roman?

28:13.627 --> 28:16.391
<i>Billionaire Dick Roman,
seen here at a press conference...</i>

28:16.563 --> 28:19.828
<i>...has been on the corporate takeover
warpath in the last months.</i>

28:20.000 --> 28:21.331
<i>Shows no sign of relenting.</i>

28:21.501 --> 28:25.528
<i>I believe in good old American values,
like unlimited growth.</i>

28:25.706 --> 28:28.174
<i>But it's like I always say,
if you wanna win...</i>

28:28.342 --> 28:30.401
<i>...then you gotta be the shark.</i>

28:30.577 --> 28:32.101
<i>And a shark's gotta eat.</i>

28:32.279 --> 28:33.746
<i>Well, that's a great question.</i>

28:33.914 --> 28:35.939
<i>Yes, we have made new acquisitions.</i>

28:36.149 --> 28:38.344
<i>I don't believe in hostile takeovers.</i>

28:38.518 --> 28:41.749
<i>I believe in merging,
and coming out on top.</i>

28:41.922 --> 28:44.618
<i>Whether at the helm
of his America's Cup-winning yacht...</i>

28:44.791 --> 28:46.452
<i>...or his Fortune 500 companies...</i>

28:46.660 --> 28:48.958
<i>...Roman has never shied away
from the spotlight.</i>

28:49.162 --> 28:51.392
<i>Roman's series
of motivational seminars...</i>

28:51.565 --> 28:55.126
<i>..."When in Rome," have outsold
every other money-making program.</i>

28:55.302 --> 28:58.863
<i>A vocal member of the NRA and
a supporter of the second amendment...</i>

28:59.039 --> 29:02.531
<i>...Roman has started attracting
conservative political attention as well.</i>

29:02.709 --> 29:05.439
<i>Roman is ruthless but good-looking.</i>

29:05.612 --> 29:07.978
<i>I think he'll make a great candidate.</i>

29:08.181 --> 29:13.084
<i>Another great question. No, I am not
running for political office at this time.</i>

29:13.253 --> 29:15.084
<i>But I do have a number one bestseller.</i>

29:16.757 --> 29:17.917
Holy crap.

29:18.091 --> 29:19.649
What the hell is that?

29:19.826 --> 29:22.294
One of the top 50 most powerful men
in America.

29:22.462 --> 29:24.692
Says here top 35 as of last month.

29:25.132 --> 29:26.599
Now it's all making sense.

29:26.767 --> 29:29.565
Remember when Crowley kept going on
about hating Dick?

29:30.971 --> 29:32.836
I thought he was just being general.

29:33.006 --> 29:35.406
If the Leviathan got to him,
then that means...

29:35.575 --> 29:38.408
...they're playing on a bigger board
than we were thinking.

29:38.578 --> 29:41.445
So what then?
I mean, we can't exactly outgun them.

29:41.615 --> 29:43.515
No. But we got the drop on them.

29:43.717 --> 29:47.414
Means we got a chance to figure out
what these guys are really doing here.

29:49.823 --> 29:51.313
Whoa, where did you get that mother?

29:51.491 --> 29:53.857
Ah, it's on loan
from Frank's Big Brother collection.

29:54.027 --> 29:58.225
It will pick up vocal vibrations
from window glass at half a mile.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.626
Well, it's time to find out
what these ugly bastards are up to.

30:10.277 --> 30:13.508
<i>The patient
is put under general anesthesia.</i>

30:13.680 --> 30:15.545
<i>The eye is immobilized.</i>

30:15.749 --> 30:19.549
<i>Then a scalpel is used
to sever the optic nerve.</i>

30:20.620 --> 30:24.647
<i>When a macular detachment occurs,
further visual field loss is...</i>

30:24.825 --> 30:27.623
The food additive
I've introduced into the Turducken...

30:27.794 --> 30:29.785
...has a near
100 percent effectiveness.

30:29.963 --> 30:33.694
Once the subject tries it,
they crave more within a few hours.

30:33.867 --> 30:36.062
The first dose starts to work
on their DNA...

30:36.269 --> 30:38.396
...slowing metabolism,
causing weight gain...

30:38.572 --> 30:43.009
...and dampening their emotional range,
which makes them perfectly complacent.

30:44.010 --> 30:48.970
As you can see, they have yet to notice
that Grandma is no longer with us.

30:49.149 --> 30:51.140
<i>Both eyes were surgically removed...</i>

30:51.318 --> 30:53.081
<i>...with the incorrect
clinical diagnosis...</i>

30:53.720 --> 30:56.587
If you leave out a cooked patty
for more than an hour...

30:56.790 --> 30:59.691
...it reverts back
to a somewhat unappealing state.

30:59.860 --> 31:02.351
But I have yet to have a case
of leftovers.

31:02.529 --> 31:03.928
You know what I love?

31:04.097 --> 31:06.793
I mean, besides handball
and a really crisp chardonnay.

31:07.501 --> 31:08.866
I love progress.

31:09.035 --> 31:13.301
And progress comes from collaboration
which makes moments like this thrilling.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.701
I am so glad to hear you say that.

31:15.876 --> 31:18.674
Now, what can you tell me
about your failures, hmm?

31:18.845 --> 31:20.210
My?

31:22.616 --> 31:24.243
The ones that went off the rails.

31:24.418 --> 31:26.352
After they ate your little treats.

31:26.520 --> 31:27.782
I, uh...

31:27.954 --> 31:31.890
- They're... They've been very instructive.
- No.

31:32.058 --> 31:33.855
See, I asked for complacency.

31:34.327 --> 31:36.921
Not complacency
and a 0.03 percent margin...

31:37.097 --> 31:40.897
...of hyperadrenalized cannibalism.
I will have this under control.

31:41.701 --> 31:44.795
Camping high season
harshed by human burrito?

31:44.971 --> 31:49.271
Have I ever mentioned how I feel about
our little forays making the papers?

31:49.443 --> 31:51.877
But, again, collaboration.

31:52.045 --> 31:54.206
Progress.

31:56.249 --> 32:00.117
I wanna turn this little mistake
into a big, fat teachable moment.

32:00.954 --> 32:02.444
Will you help me with that?

32:03.156 --> 32:05.590
Well, yes. Heh.

32:05.759 --> 32:06.851
Of course.

32:08.595 --> 32:10.119
Our side is still dead, Bobby.

32:10.297 --> 32:11.594
Anything with you?

32:12.132 --> 32:14.100
Yeah, same here.

32:14.267 --> 32:15.757
I got...

32:16.069 --> 32:17.627
Hold on.

32:17.971 --> 32:19.336
<i>Yeah, I got movement.</i>

32:19.506 --> 32:21.997
My side, second floor, meeting room.

32:22.976 --> 32:26.503
I'll reschedule with the senator,
you can deal with the archdiocese...

32:26.680 --> 32:28.113
...in the afternoon.
Fine.

32:28.281 --> 32:30.977
<i>Let me explain to you
what our program has to offer.</i>

32:31.151 --> 32:34.348
No. Let me explain
why we're shutting your program down.

32:34.521 --> 32:36.148
Shutting it down? You can't.

32:36.323 --> 32:39.019
I'm shutting it down
because of the one golden rule.

32:39.192 --> 32:41.490
- Do you know it?
- Yes. Don't make the papers.

32:41.661 --> 32:43.993
- And I promise that...
- No. The golden rule...

32:44.164 --> 32:46.291
...is there's no such thing
as monsters.

32:46.466 --> 32:50.596
Anything stirs their little pots
to the contrary, very bad for our plans.

32:50.770 --> 32:54.763
So how can I use your mistake to
communicate this to all your coworkers?

32:54.941 --> 32:58.707
Listen, sir, I will do anything.
I will give anything to make this right.

33:00.947 --> 33:02.812
I know you will.

33:18.298 --> 33:19.424
You're bibbing me?

33:32.679 --> 33:34.840
Do you know what you can give us,
doctor?

33:36.316 --> 33:38.250
Your example.

33:43.490 --> 33:44.855
<i>What's happening now?</i>

33:45.025 --> 33:46.322
Wait.

33:47.160 --> 33:48.218
Now, doc.

33:48.695 --> 33:50.492
It's time.

33:56.536 --> 33:59.369
Now I have officially seen it all.

33:59.539 --> 34:00.597
Bobby, what is it?

34:00.774 --> 34:03.766
He's making the doctor eat himself.

34:04.244 --> 34:05.609
- What?
- He's...

34:15.121 --> 34:16.554
They got him.

34:17.857 --> 34:20.018
There are at least four Leviathans
out there.

34:20.193 --> 34:22.491
We don't even know how to kill one.

34:28.435 --> 34:31.370
It will be a shock
when we walk in through the front door.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.531
We'll have the jet on standby at O'Hare.

34:35.708 --> 34:37.938
Thursday morning, you close
on the land acquisition.

34:38.110 --> 34:39.442
Fine.

34:39.612 --> 34:41.978
And this came this afternoon.

34:42.148 --> 34:44.616
- Sotheby's.
- Outstanding.

34:45.051 --> 34:47.281
Thank you, Susan.

34:47.721 --> 34:49.052
Oh, and, Susan.

34:50.556 --> 34:51.614
Eh...

35:02.602 --> 35:03.967
No, you're not tied up.

35:04.137 --> 35:06.765
We both know
you're not gonna get past me.

35:06.940 --> 35:08.066
How's your head?

35:08.908 --> 35:10.603
So you got Dick Roman.

35:11.277 --> 35:13.336
We can have whoever we want.

35:13.546 --> 35:15.173
We could have you, for example.

35:15.348 --> 35:16.940
If you were worth the effort.

35:17.117 --> 35:18.641
Oh, you're hurting my feelings.

35:18.818 --> 35:22.481
Well, it's a hard world, Bob.
It's an us-eat-dog world.

35:22.656 --> 35:26.183
- What have you got there?
- Winning bid at auction.

35:29.496 --> 35:30.986
Beautiful.

35:32.599 --> 35:35.830
Known for their peerless sighting.

35:36.603 --> 35:38.298
I imagine you appreciate guns.

35:38.471 --> 35:40.871
I'd appreciate one right about now.

35:42.475 --> 35:45.444
But I mean the machine, the idea.

35:45.612 --> 35:48.172
Just one of your species'
most inspired inventions.

35:48.348 --> 35:50.373
I mean it.
I really think you have spunk.

35:50.583 --> 35:53.984
You're like a planet of just the cutest
little engines that could.

35:54.154 --> 35:59.023
But like the late, great,
actual Dick Roman used to say...

35:59.192 --> 36:02.355
...to the whores
he'd kick out of a presidential suite:

36:04.631 --> 36:07.099
"Cute don't quite hack it, sugar."

36:07.500 --> 36:09.627
Oh, let's just cut to the chase.

36:09.803 --> 36:13.170
I clearly ain't worth the extra time
I'm getting here.

36:13.740 --> 36:15.605
I'm gonna eat you, Bob.

36:17.644 --> 36:19.043
Yes.

36:19.212 --> 36:20.907
But I like my meals prepared.

36:21.381 --> 36:23.474
Holding onto you
could pay big dividends.

36:23.650 --> 36:26.983
I bet your friends are on their way
to rescue the damsel.

36:27.153 --> 36:30.816
No, they're too smart.
They know they don't have the numbers.

36:30.990 --> 36:32.514
It would be suicide.

36:32.692 --> 36:34.489
I've run my race.

36:34.661 --> 36:36.686
Could die worse.

36:52.712 --> 36:54.407
No!

37:06.793 --> 37:09.284
I'd stay in the chair.

37:45.465 --> 37:47.228
Okay, sons of bitches.

37:47.767 --> 37:50.099
Let's see what you're up to now.

37:51.437 --> 37:52.995
You're coming with me.

38:16.029 --> 38:17.360
Sam.

38:17.530 --> 38:20.761
That is not how we communicate
from a place of yes.

38:22.435 --> 38:23.629
That was bracing.

38:23.803 --> 38:25.464
Where did you kids find this stuff?

38:28.975 --> 38:31.102
Hey!

38:31.277 --> 38:33.268
That's mine.

38:34.047 --> 38:36.481
- Ugh!
- Go! Go!

38:38.484 --> 38:40.452
Would you stop it with that stuff?

38:48.194 --> 38:50.253
Damn it, where's Bobby?

38:58.538 --> 38:59.800
Bobby. Come on.

38:59.973 --> 39:01.065
Come on, come on.

39:03.710 --> 39:05.200
Go! Go!

39:17.290 --> 39:19.224
Son of a bitch.

39:19.659 --> 39:21.092
I'm glad you got in.

39:21.294 --> 39:23.660
He almost took your freaking head off.

39:24.397 --> 39:27.730
Hey, Bobby, your hat.

39:34.574 --> 39:36.064
Bobby?

39:36.542 --> 39:37.770
Oh, God. Bobby?

39:37.944 --> 39:39.104
Bobby?

39:39.512 --> 39:41.412
Bobby?

39:41.748 --> 39:43.511
Bobby?
