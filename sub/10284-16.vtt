WEBVTT

00:03.540 --> 00:04.939
Previously on E.R.

00:05.010 --> 00:07.640
Our goal is to enroll 200
donor-recipient pairs.

00:07.710 --> 00:08.910
By mixing and matching,

00:08.980 --> 00:10.810
we'd find kidneys for almost 50% of
them.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.010
Ask me again.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.910
Ask me to marry you.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.590
I don't know what happened

00:21.110 --> 00:22.380
If it is what I think,

00:22.440 --> 00:24.610
it scares the hell out of me.

00:24.680 --> 00:26.740
She's yours,Tony.

00:26.810 --> 00:28.310
Is it possible?

00:30.830 --> 00:33.230
Crisis of conscience

00:38.310 --> 00:40.010
Oh,crap!

00:40.280 --> 00:41.010
What time is it?

00:41.180 --> 00:42.810
6:15. You let me fall asleep!

00:43.650 --> 00:44.910
I don't want to stay over.

00:44.980 --> 00:47.280
-It's okay. -No,it's not okay.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.680
We agreed that it was too soon for
Sarah to deal with this.

00:49.770 --> 00:51.770
Sleep in for another hour. She won't
even know you're here.

00:51.870 --> 00:54.080
Well,when are you going to tell her?

00:54.140 --> 00:55.100
Tell her what?

00:55.810 --> 00:56.970
Come on.

00:57.450 --> 00:58.510
I don't even know if it's true.

00:58.580 --> 01:00.480
Well,you will be if you do the test.

01:00.540 --> 01:01.710
What am I supposed to do?

01:01.780 --> 01:03.280
"Hey,can I have some of your DNA?

01:03.340 --> 01:04.840
I want to find out if I'm your father"?

01:04.910 --> 01:07.480
What if I'm not?I don't want to mess
with the kid's head.

01:07.540 --> 01:10.640
-Why,are you afraid to find out? -No.
Maybe.

01:10.910 --> 01:12.280
I don't know.

01:12.340 --> 01:16.010
Maybe the actual biology doesn't matter
anyway,huh?

01:19.180 --> 01:22.140
Of course it does.

01:22.410 --> 01:24.310
You want something to eat before you
go?

01:24.380 --> 01:25.210
No,I'm fine.

01:25.230 --> 01:27.130
-Some juice? -We don't have any.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.340
I'm sorry. Did we wake you?

01:31.410 --> 01:32.810
No,I couldn't sleep.

01:33.480 --> 01:34.840
I'm just leaving.

01:34.910 --> 01:36.780
You don't have to sneak out.

01:36.840 --> 01:38.580
She's not sneaking out. She's going to
work.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.280
And I'm... late.

01:40.340 --> 01:43.440
-I'll page you later? -Okay.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.710
I made coffee.

01:46.780 --> 01:48.080
Since when do you drink coffee?

01:48.140 --> 01:49.510
Since we ran out of juice.

01:49.580 --> 01:51.080
Oh. Give me some.

01:51.140 --> 01:54.480
Sorry,I meant to go to the store. I
just...

01:54.540 --> 01:56.110
You know,if you want me to,

01:56.180 --> 01:59.010
I can do all the cooking and the
shopping and cleaning.

01:59.080 --> 02:00.110
If you did that,

02:00.180 --> 02:01.380
when would you do your homework

02:01.440 --> 02:03.380
and talk to boys on the phone and text?

02:03.440 --> 02:05.940
It's called multitasking.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.009
Since it is plainly ludicrous

02:11.080 --> 02:13.980
to page a surgeon at 6:15 in the
morning

02:14.040 --> 02:15.410
for something as silly as Tylenol,

02:15.480 --> 02:17.340
the only conceivable explanation I have
for your call

02:17.410 --> 02:19.510
is that you have a crush on me.

02:19.580 --> 02:22.640
I'm flattered. Thank you. Good-bye.

02:22.710 --> 02:23.880
Who was that?

02:23.940 --> 02:26.140
This new ICU nurse. She's useless.

02:26.210 --> 02:27.840
Someone needs to show her the ropes.

02:28.210 --> 02:31.410
Did you say "ropes"?

02:31.680 --> 02:32.910
Jane,come on.

02:32.980 --> 02:34.410
I have to round soon.

02:34.420 --> 02:37.540
FYI? This is my last night in the call
room.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.320
The prosthetics lab could be fun.

02:39.320 --> 02:41.280
No,we're through with hospital kink.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.110
We're staying at your place next time.

02:43.110 --> 02:44.510
Whoa,whoa,whoa. No,we can't. I...

02:45.240 --> 02:49.940
I know,I know,you have no bed,you sleep
on the couch,your sink is clogged,

02:50.020 --> 02:53.240
this pathetic "I work all the time, so
my place is a rat hole" thing

02:53.340 --> 02:55.340
is not going to fly anymore.

02:55.480 --> 02:56.090
What?

02:56.520 --> 02:58.210
Yeah,you're going to clean up your
apartment

02:58.280 --> 03:00.610
and buy a proper bed today.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.380
Jane,just because you want to stay at
my place...

03:03.440 --> 03:05.440
Hey,it's been three months,okay?

03:05.510 --> 03:06.940
Upgrade the sleeping arrangements

03:07.010 --> 03:09.180
-or you will be punished. -Ooh.

03:09.240 --> 03:11.940
-Do you understand? -Yeah.

03:12.010 --> 03:13.710
It's tradition, a symbol.

03:13.780 --> 03:17.940
Yeah,a symbol of the wedding industrial
complex.

03:18.010 --> 03:19.110
No,I'll wear a ring.

03:19.180 --> 03:20.480
I want to wear a ring,

03:20.540 --> 03:23.280
you just have to abide by my ring
policy.

03:23.340 --> 03:25.490
Your ring policy?

03:26.910 --> 03:29.010
Yeah,if one of us loses our wedding
ring,

03:29.080 --> 03:32.020
we replace the ring immediately and
give the new ring full status.

03:32.150 --> 03:33.540
You're going to lose it?

03:33.790 --> 03:35.840
Well,I don't know,if something happens
to the ring,

03:35.910 --> 03:39.340
and everybody freaks out like the
marriage is doomed.

03:42.740 --> 03:45.110
But a simple gold band would be very
nice.

03:45.180 --> 03:47.010
Now we're getting somewhere.

03:49.080 --> 03:52.680
So do you think we should make an
announcement

03:52.740 --> 03:55.580
or just tell people individually and
let it trickle out?

03:55.640 --> 03:58.310
Uh,is it all right if we wait a while?

03:58.380 --> 03:59.810
Really? Why?

03:59.880 --> 04:02.580
When-when you tell people you're
getting married,

04:02.640 --> 04:06.040
they start asking a million questions
about a wedding,

04:06.110 --> 04:09.810
and marriage is not about wedding.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.680
Like it's not about ring.

04:14.780 --> 04:18.510
Let's just enjoy this for a while, the
two of us,okay?

04:18.579 --> 04:20.180
That's fine.

04:20.240 --> 04:22.440
A secret engagement will be fun.

04:23.740 --> 04:25.640
All right,Jane, you take the boob rash

04:25.710 --> 04:27.740
and,Ray,you get the bounty hunter with
the gout.

04:27.810 --> 04:30.410
Dr. Kovac returns. Nice seeing you
again,man.

04:30.480 --> 04:31.510
-You,too. -Welcome back.

04:31.580 --> 04:32.810
It was weird here without you.

04:33.810 --> 04:34.610
What's that?

04:34.680 --> 04:36.140
A rat died in the air vent.

04:36.210 --> 04:37.480
There's a cleaning crew up there.

04:39.410 --> 04:41.780
Hey,did you really squash your own hand
in a vise?

04:41.840 --> 04:44.840
I mean,'cause, wow,that's...

04:44.910 --> 04:46.210
Need a doc here.

04:46.280 --> 04:47.710
Jane,why don't we take this?

04:47.780 --> 04:50.540
35-year-old with uncontrollable
seizures.

04:50.610 --> 04:52.540
You,take the bus.

04:52.610 --> 04:54.410
Something bad's going to happen on the
El today.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.510
I upped my meds,but-but-but the
seizures won't stop.

04:58.580 --> 04:59.740
Well,you're not seizing now.

04:59.810 --> 05:01.210
No,yes,yes,I am.

05:01.280 --> 05:03.780
I-I... two milligrams of Ativan should
take care of it.

05:03.940 --> 05:05.810
Sir,you're sitting up and you're
talking to me.

05:05.980 --> 05:07.880
-You're not having a seizure. -Can we
not stop here?

05:07.920 --> 05:08.690
We're about to transfer you.

05:08.790 --> 05:10.160
Yeah,but can you just move me back at
all here?

05:10.260 --> 05:11.160
Just be patient.

05:11.260 --> 05:13.260
-Move me now,please?! -All right,all
right.

ER Season 13 Episode 16

05:30.320 --> 05:32.320
Lily's sick, Marquez is out on
vacation,

05:32.390 --> 05:34.860
and the rest of us are doing doubles
trying to cover all their shifts.

05:34.920 --> 05:37.190
This is why nurses quit and burn out.

05:37.260 --> 05:39.320
Shortage just keeps getting worse. What
about your boy ***?

05:39.450 --> 05:41.720
Uh,he was lured to a hospital in
Minneapolis.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.160
New cars for nurses willing to stay six
months.

05:44.990 --> 05:45.660
Cool with that?

05:45.720 --> 05:47.620
What,I got left for a Camry?

05:47.690 --> 05:48.920
Nah,it's a good gig.

05:48.990 --> 05:50.860
I can't blame him.

05:50.920 --> 05:54.560
Anna Hayes,39,vomiting and altered
mental status.

05:54.620 --> 05:57.160
Tachy to 120, sats 92 on room air.

05:57.220 --> 05:58.560
This your mom?

05:58.620 --> 06:00.520
Yeah. I could barely wake her up this
morning.

06:00.590 --> 06:01.720
Ms. Hayes, I'm Dr. Gates.

06:01.790 --> 06:02.720
Can you open your eyes for me,please?

06:02.790 --> 06:03.720
Please,just take me home.

06:03.790 --> 06:05.360
No,you need oxygen and fluids.

06:05.420 --> 06:06.490
Wait,is she going to be all right?

06:06.560 --> 06:08.020
Honey,I'm fine.

06:08.090 --> 06:09.720
Ma'am,you're not fine, you're severely
dehydrated,

06:09.730 --> 06:10.380
but we're going to help you with that.

06:10.390 --> 06:12.040
Access?

06:12.100 --> 06:14.190
20-gauge in the right antecube, but it
blew.

06:14.260 --> 06:15.260
Sam?

06:16.230 --> 06:18.760
Trauma One's open. I'll be right in.

06:18.820 --> 06:20.320
Hey,Jeff,what's up?

06:20.790 --> 06:23.360
I think we have something that belongs
to you.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.260
Alex,what happened?

06:28.990 --> 06:31.020
Okay,Mr. Brewer, let's get you hooked
up.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.020
Yeah,okay. You're not going to need
that.

06:33.090 --> 06:34.090
You're not going to need that?

06:34.160 --> 06:35.390
No?

06:35.460 --> 06:37.660
No,these are temporal lobe
seizures,okay?

06:37.720 --> 06:40.690
I never have any cardiac or respiratory
symptoms.

06:40.750 --> 06:42.390
Okay,well,we'll just hook you up to be
safe.

06:42.460 --> 06:46.620
If you haven't noticed,
my-my,uh,seizures are unusual.

06:46.720 --> 06:50.460
I get hunches,premonitions, that sort
of thing.

06:50.520 --> 06:53.290
Nothing ever shows up on the heart
monitor.

06:53.360 --> 06:54.960
-I see. -Yeah.

06:55.020 --> 06:57.190
Oh,here comes another one.

06:57.260 --> 06:58.530
I'm sensing...

07:00.590 --> 07:02.540
bacon and eggs.

07:03.820 --> 07:06.520
There you go,okay?

07:06.590 --> 07:08.290
So can you just give me the Ativan

07:08.360 --> 07:09.760
and I'll be out of your hair?

07:09.820 --> 07:11.190
I'm sorry,but I just think

07:11.260 --> 07:13.290
anybody could have made that
prediction,Mr. Brewer.

07:14.090 --> 07:17.920
Look,I know that,uh,it looks like I'm
making this stuff up

07:17.990 --> 07:20.140
just so I can get drugs...

07:20.590 --> 07:22.560
but that's not what's going on,okay?

07:22.620 --> 07:25.640
Can you call my neurologist? He'll back
me up.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.010
Did you get what you want,Alex?

07:29.190 --> 07:31.360
Huh? A couple bags of quarters?

07:31.420 --> 07:33.490
You know what? You can be in jail right
now.

07:33.560 --> 07:35.760
It's not anything like they're
saying,okay?

07:35.820 --> 07:38.060
Officer Greenberg is going to take you
home.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.720
I'm going to call you every half hour.

07:39.790 --> 07:41.720
You don't answer that phone, we got a
problem.

07:41.790 --> 07:44.480
-Mom,it's not my fault. -Of course,it's
not,it never is.

07:44.580 --> 07:46.660
Mom,please, just listen to me.

07:47.290 --> 07:50.260
I have to go back to work. I'll talk to
you tonight.

07:50.850 --> 07:52.520
-Thank you very much,Jeff. -Yeah.

07:54.680 --> 07:57.990
Hey. What's up with Alex?

07:58.060 --> 08:00.190
He knocked off a Laundromat near his
school.

08:00.260 --> 08:01.390
Ah...

08:01.460 --> 08:04.520
I'll get better faster at home,really.

08:04.590 --> 08:06.700
Mom,you're sick,okay? We're not
leaving.

08:07.420 --> 08:10.160
-She hates hospitals. -Oh,but this is
County.

08:10.260 --> 08:12.790
This is nice here.You get organic food
and room massage.

08:12.870 --> 08:16.100
We have ice sculptures. You're going to
love it here.

08:17.320 --> 08:18.890
All right,she needs coags.

08:18.960 --> 08:20.850
She's oozing around the needle.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.560
Pulse up to 125.

08:22.620 --> 08:24.560
You know,when you were four years old,

08:24.620 --> 08:27.220
our neighbor fell off that ladder and
they brought him here.

08:28.380 --> 08:29.690
Mr. Madsen?

08:30.140 --> 08:32.120
Oh,he was such a grouch.

08:32.630 --> 08:36.190
He was always yelling at you and your
brother for playing too loud.

08:36.650 --> 08:40.200
But when you found out he was sick, you
wanted to visit him.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.440
Systolic's only 84. She needs
access,Gates.

08:44.550 --> 08:48.490
I'm trying,Sam.She's clamping down. One
more try and I'll go central.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.560
You stood up on your chair

08:50.620 --> 08:55.860
and you stuck your favorite toy turtle
in bed with him,and you said anybody

08:55.920 --> 08:58.260
who was sick, needed a toy turtle.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.720
She's making this up.

08:59.790 --> 09:04.560
No,no,I made a lot of mistakes,son,

09:05.790 --> 09:08.080
but you were the one thing I got right.

09:09.240 --> 09:10.460
All right,I'm in,Sam.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.480
Let's get the fluids up.

09:17.910 --> 09:19.110
You okay?

09:19.820 --> 09:20.910
Yeah.

09:23.210 --> 09:24.890
Morning,Neela. Ready to round?

09:24.960 --> 09:27.720
Uh,sorry. Shoot, I need five more
minutes.

09:27.750 --> 09:30.080
I overslept.I never oversleep. Is that
a yoga mat?

09:30.190 --> 09:32.840
Yeah,there's an Ashtanga class in the
anesthesia conference room.

09:32.930 --> 09:33.590
You should check it out.

09:33.730 --> 09:36.200
Nurses station,five minutes. I'll see
you there.

09:37.680 --> 09:41.200
Uh,hello,good morning. I'm Dr....

09:42.230 --> 09:43.140
Manish?

09:43.250 --> 09:46.560
Hi. Uh,this is the doctor I was telling
you about.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.960
I'm Emily. I've heard a lot about you.

09:49.190 --> 09:50.290
What are you doing here?

09:50.360 --> 09:53.250
-Uh,well,I was... -Saving my life.

09:54.160 --> 09:58.260
I was giving a talk about the paired
exchange program

09:58.320 --> 09:59.720
at a dialysis center in Evanston...

09:59.790 --> 10:02.420
He was really impressive. He gave us
all hope.

10:03.040 --> 10:06.510
And there were all these people
there,and they were just waiting and
suffering

10:06.600 --> 10:09.560
and it inspired me.

10:09.560 --> 10:13.980
To donate your kidney? You ran
screaming from a blood drive.

10:14.710 --> 10:16.810
Well,I was moved by their stories.

10:17.410 --> 10:18.840
We've worked together every day for the
past month.

10:18.930 --> 10:20.450
How come you never said anything?

10:22.010 --> 10:23.960
'Cause I thought that I'd chicken out.

10:24.910 --> 10:26.790
I've been on dialysis for six years,

10:27.210 --> 10:28.990
on the UNOS list for five.

10:29.500 --> 10:33.270
I'd just about given up when,boom,

10:33.670 --> 10:35.760
Manish walks into my life.

10:35.820 --> 10:37.920
Got tested,turns out I'm a good match.

10:37.990 --> 10:39.520
Wow.

10:39.590 --> 10:40.820
Amazing,right?

10:40.890 --> 10:43.260
It's like right out of a movie or
something.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.190
What's your differential?

10:49.260 --> 10:51.560
Infectious hepatitis is at the top of
my list.

10:51.620 --> 10:53.020
Sent viral titers.

10:53.090 --> 10:54.390
Good. What else?

10:54.460 --> 10:56.690
Hepato-renal syndrome, vascular
disorder,

10:56.760 --> 11:00.960
autoimmune, alcoholic hepatitis.

11:01.020 --> 11:02.390
But my mom doesn't drink.

11:02.460 --> 11:03.960
Oh,we're just running through the
possibilities.

11:04.020 --> 11:07.720
Here,Luka,Jane's tibia fractures got
compartment syndrome-- ortho's MIA.

11:08.490 --> 11:11.710
What about toxic ingestions?
Acetaminophen,poison mushrooms?

11:12.360 --> 11:13.890
Tox screen's negative, acetaminophen's
zero.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.620
Okay,get a CT and notify nephrology and
GI.

11:16.690 --> 11:18.160
Sam,come with me.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.990
Is there,uh,is there anyone else you
want to be here?

11:21.520 --> 11:23.870
My other son's at work. Don't bother
him.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.060
Oh,I think he should be here. Is it
close?

11:26.120 --> 11:28.590
He's a repair guy over at Begley's
Appliances.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.260
My mom works there,too.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.790
It's just the stomach flu. Don't bother
Nick.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.120
It's a little more serious.

11:34.190 --> 11:37.360
Why don't you go out to the front desk.
The clerk will help you call your
brother.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.230
It's all right,honey. Go.

11:41.140 --> 11:43.990
It's out there to the left. Thanks.

11:46.060 --> 11:48.060
You're scaring him.

11:50.820 --> 11:52.720
You're in acute liver failure,ma'am.

11:52.790 --> 11:55.060
This-this is a little scary.

11:58.970 --> 12:00.160
Did you hear what I said?

12:00.390 --> 12:02.090
This is serious. You could die.

12:03.710 --> 12:05.120
I heard you.

12:05.740 --> 12:07.700
Do you have any questions?

12:10.910 --> 12:12.060
No.

12:15.650 --> 12:17.970
Manish nearly fainted the other day
when I was drawing blood.

12:18.090 --> 12:20.930
Now he's giving his kidney to someone
he barely just met.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.190
Isn't that a little strange?

12:22.270 --> 12:25.690
No,everyone goes through some kind of a
mini-life crisis in their 20s.

12:25.760 --> 12:29.420
He's far from family,he's unattached,
he's unsure about career,

12:29.690 --> 12:31.360
he's drifting, he's looking for
purpose.

12:31.360 --> 12:34.190
Some people donate kidneys, others end
up working at the Jumbo Mart.

12:34.430 --> 12:35.140
Who are we to judge?

12:35.240 --> 12:36.850
Neela,what are you doing?

12:37.110 --> 12:38.790
I came down to see the volvulus case.

12:38.860 --> 12:40.360
But you're supposed to be covering the
post-op floor.

12:40.420 --> 12:42.300
You done with all those dressing
changes?

12:42.400 --> 12:43.320
Well,not all of them,no.

12:43.380 --> 12:45.360
Okay,I'm going to leave you kids to
work this out.

12:45.420 --> 12:47.290
I'll be in Curtain Three.

12:47.360 --> 12:50.020
-You,upstairs,shoo. -Well...

12:52.210 --> 12:53.510
What is this?

12:53.890 --> 12:55.480
A consult note.

12:55.890 --> 12:58.610
-I said black ink today. Only black.
-Oh...

12:58.740 --> 13:01.800
-What color is this? -Eh,blue.Oops.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.300
Hey,Mayday. How's it going?

13:10.080 --> 13:15.040
Well,my attending thinks I'm a complete
idiot, and Crenshaw's back to being a
little bitch.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.420
Hey,most hepatic toxins take a few days

13:17.500 --> 13:18.590
to destroy the liver,right?

13:18.770 --> 13:19.380
Yeah.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.420
So,theoretically, you could trash your
liver,

13:21.520 --> 13:24.850
but by the time you become symptomatic,
the toxin couldn't be detected in the
blood.

13:25.030 --> 13:26.270
I suppose.

13:26.970 --> 13:28.700
Hmm. I'll page you later.

13:30.180 --> 13:31.570
Ms. Hayes?

13:32.740 --> 13:34.210
Anna.

13:35.170 --> 13:36.590
Anna...

13:37.710 --> 13:40.290
What's a young,healthy woman with no
medical history

13:40.360 --> 13:42.260
doing with fulminant liver failure?

13:43.760 --> 13:45.690
Aren't you the doctor?

13:47.030 --> 13:49.490
You got a family, 40 good years ahead
of you.

13:49.860 --> 13:52.520
Yet when I told you,you might die,you
hardly reacted.

13:53.190 --> 13:55.990
Yeah. I guess we all have our own way

13:56.120 --> 13:58.340
of dealing with bad news.

13:58.490 --> 14:01.760
Huh. You know,I used to be a paramedic
for ten years

14:02.120 --> 14:04.290
before I became a doctor.

14:04.660 --> 14:10.670
Young healthy patients,no matter how
religious,mellow,Zen they were...

14:11.390 --> 14:13.320
they don't want to die.

14:13.660 --> 14:17.560
Something kicks in-- instinct.

14:17.920 --> 14:22.290
Maybe I've just been too tired to cry.

14:23.390 --> 14:25.330
You seem depressed.

14:30.460 --> 14:33.030
Let's say someone wanted to kill
themselves

14:33.110 --> 14:36.650
without anyone knowing it was suicide.

14:37.720 --> 14:40.990
You know,there's a whole class of
chemicals

14:41.360 --> 14:45.390
that can damage the liver just days
after they're ingested.

14:46.290 --> 14:47.550
Please.

14:47.780 --> 14:49.540
I just want to go to sleep now.

14:49.620 --> 14:55.830
Fuels and solvents found in
refrigerators, dryers,cleaning
products.

14:56.090 --> 14:59.490
Stuff you'd have access to every day at
your job.

15:05.100 --> 15:07.200
Come on,Anna,tell me what you took so I
can help you.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.930
Your sons deserve to have you around.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.380
-They're all grown up now. -I know I'm
right about this.

15:11.640 --> 15:15.880
Propane? Kerosene?Carbon tetrachloride?
What? Tell me.

15:19.700 --> 15:24.320
I hear if you mix it with juice, it's
got quite a kick.

15:27.310 --> 15:29.110
Everything okay?

15:30.390 --> 15:33.060
Anna?!Anna?!!

15:34.960 --> 15:36.860
Everything's back to normal with you
and Luka?

15:37.220 --> 15:41.360
Uh,I don't know if I'd say normal, but
they're good.

15:41.720 --> 15:45.990
-How's things with you and Katey?
-Uh,she's great.Really great.

15:46.360 --> 15:47.690
But?

15:48.060 --> 15:49.270
But nothing. She's awesome.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.360
Our friend's hurt. Help!

15:51.720 --> 15:53.490
Don't move so fast. Come on,you're
tough.

15:53.860 --> 15:55.390
Please don't make me walk. You can do
it.

15:55.760 --> 15:57.020
Come on,guys, give her a break.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.730
-I got her. -Get a gurney over here
please.

15:59.810 --> 16:00.920
-Are you a doctor? -We both are.

16:01.150 --> 16:03.830
Okay,what happened? They were doing a
formation called layer cake.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.150
Most schools do three layers and we do
five.

16:06.250 --> 16:07.780
Tasha fell all the way from the top.

16:07.820 --> 16:09.580
Wow,four layer fall,huh?

16:09.640 --> 16:11.830
I need this kiddo back in action for
the Great Lakes Regionals.

16:11.860 --> 16:13.890
Okay,Tasha,let's go.

16:14.450 --> 16:15.450
Clear.

16:16.410 --> 16:17.930
Still V tach. No pulse.

16:18.550 --> 16:21.300
-Gates,I got poison control on the
line. -All right,put them on
speakerphone.

16:21.450 --> 16:23.390
-Wh... What's this about? -Okay,she's
on.

16:23.540 --> 16:25.790
Possible carbon tetrachloride overdose.

16:25.910 --> 16:27.710
Fulminant liver and kidney failure.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.370
Why the hell didn't you say anything
about this before?

16:29.450 --> 16:30.740
It was just a hunch.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.360
When did the exposure occur?

16:32.720 --> 16:33.760
Unclear.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.860
Transaminases in 2,000 range.

16:36.340 --> 16:39.190
It's too late.Nothing to offer other
than supportive measures.

16:39.540 --> 16:40.860
Nothing to offer?

16:41.220 --> 16:42.390
No. If it's carbon tet,the damage to
the liver has already been done.

16:43.160 --> 16:46.040
I'm afraid that's right. Cell death is
irreversible at this point.

16:46.140 --> 16:47.320
All right,thanks.

16:47.420 --> 16:48.460
Epi's in,fourth dose.

16:48.890 --> 16:50.320
Another hundred of lido and recheck the
K.

16:50.690 --> 16:53.730
Wh... why were you withholding patient
history?

16:53.940 --> 16:56.100
I wasn't sure. She didn't fully admit
it. Charging to 360.

16:56.860 --> 16:57.860
Where'd her son go?

16:57.990 --> 17:00.080
He's out at the front desk trying to
bet ahold of his brother.

17:00.170 --> 17:01.580
Well,he better find him fast.

17:02.560 --> 17:03.710
All right,clear.

17:05.359 --> 17:08.329
I don't think I could do something like
this for a stranger.

17:08.430 --> 17:11.030
So,maybe it bothers me that you can.

17:11.130 --> 17:13.410
Look,Emily's parents are too old to be
donors.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.569
She's getting sicker every day.You
would have done the same thing.

17:15.710 --> 17:17.760
I don't think so. You're a better
person.

17:18.359 --> 17:19.520
I'm not a better person,Neela.

17:19.890 --> 17:22.869
I'd be too worried about time lost from
work,complications.

17:23.190 --> 17:23.819
I don't mean to be negative,

17:24.190 --> 17:26.859
but you have to at least consider the
possibility of bleeding,infection...

17:26.930 --> 17:29.410
I've considered it. We've all
considered it.

17:29.570 --> 17:31.210
-It's covered. -Covered?

17:35.820 --> 17:36.970
Manish...

17:37.080 --> 17:39.730
Look,it wasn't my intent, it wasn't why
I agreed,

17:39.890 --> 17:42.340
but they offered, they insisted
actually.

17:42.430 --> 17:44.640
-Manish,no. -Just listen,okay?

17:44.810 --> 17:45.730
First I refused.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.720
But then I started thinking what
$50,000 could do for my family.

17:48.780 --> 17:49.990
Stop. I don't want to hear any more.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.770
Look,when I was 14,my parents sent me
here to live with a distant cousin.

17:54.300 --> 17:56.410
I went to school, I learned English,I
played baseball,

17:56.450 --> 17:59.220
while my sisters sewed shirts for two
dollars a day in Mumbai.

17:59.340 --> 18:02.130
-I understand you feel guilty.
-Yeah,well,with $50,000,

18:02.350 --> 18:05.760
I could hire an immigration lawyer. I
can get my whole family over here.

18:05.990 --> 18:09.700
My parents could get proper health
care. My sisters could get a proper
education.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.630
Emily's family is wealthy.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.870
It's no hardship for them. So why not?

18:15.070 --> 18:18.690
Because people don't sell their body
parts in this country,period.

18:19.170 --> 18:22.180
Not to mention the fact that you could
put our whole transplant program in
jeopardy.

18:22.220 --> 18:25.030
-Nobody needs to know. -But I
know,Manish.

18:26.680 --> 18:27.640
I don't understand why you told me,

18:27.750 --> 18:29.160
but if you were looking to clear your
conscience,

18:29.280 --> 18:30.390
I can't help you there.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.470
Of all people,I would think that you
would understand.

18:32.550 --> 18:33.730
Well,I don't understand.

18:33.810 --> 18:37.290
I don't. And I kind of resent the
assumption that I should.

18:37.660 --> 18:39.260
You can't do this, Manish,I'm sorry.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.090
No deformities, no step-offs.

18:42.460 --> 18:44.120
We have this one cheer, it's so cool.

18:44.490 --> 18:45.460
It's called paper dolls.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.080
Yeah,it's our signature formation.

18:47.170 --> 18:49.160
It's like a college level routine.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.680
Pulse is in the 120s, and the hemacue
is dropping.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.860
That would be because she's bleeding
into her belly.

18:53.920 --> 18:54.820
I have fluid here.

18:54.930 --> 18:56.820
We've got the All-Cheer Regionals
coming up next week.

18:57.190 --> 18:58.230
I've been driving them too hard.

18:58.300 --> 19:00.660
The outer flyers have their outside
hand in the half "Y,"

19:01.020 --> 19:02.410
and the other hand grabs hold of the
middle flyer.

19:02.570 --> 19:03.670
That's me.

19:03.730 --> 19:06.370
-And the ending is really cute. -Sounds
great.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.890
Liter of warm salinewide open, and call
for O-neg.

19:09.030 --> 19:10.790
Make sure surgery knows to get down
here.

19:10.990 --> 19:12.390
Oh,my God,surgery?

19:12.540 --> 19:14.390
If we don't have a middle flyer for the
competition,

19:14.590 --> 19:15.200
-we are so screwed. -Watch it,girls.

19:16.090 --> 19:18.370
Why don't we worry less about the
competition and more about your
friend,okay?

19:18.910 --> 19:20.460
I'll get the infuser.

19:23.150 --> 19:25.670
-Do you guys have any warm saline?
-There's LR in the oven.

19:25.980 --> 19:29.170
K is 7.2. Amp of D-50 and ten units of
insulin.

19:29.350 --> 19:30.370
Her nose is bleeding.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.690
Her coags are through the roof.

19:32.060 --> 19:33.860
Oh,my God,she wasn't like this when I
left.

19:34.190 --> 19:36.420
Her condition changed quickly.

19:36.790 --> 19:37.920
Without a functioning liver,

19:38.290 --> 19:39.760
toxins start to accumulate in the
blood.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.390
She's in an abnormal heart rhythm.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.850
She isn't getting enough blood to her
brain and body.

19:45.080 --> 19:47.640
We're doing CPR, and giving her
medications,

19:47.790 --> 19:49.850
but she's just not responding.

19:49.950 --> 19:51.720
But can't you just do something to fix
her liver?

19:52.090 --> 19:54.190
Once the cells have died, there's
little we can do,Evan.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.870
So is this it, or what?

19:55.960 --> 19:58.230
We're breathing and compressing her
heart for her,

19:58.320 --> 20:02.230
but your mother's body is... shutting
down.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.040
Anything you guys want to say?

20:08.200 --> 20:10.710
No,Mom,okay? This isn't happening.

20:11.270 --> 20:12.870
This can't be happening.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.020
Please don't go.

20:15.110 --> 20:17.830
-One more round for the kids? -Don't
let her die.

20:19.450 --> 20:20.400
Sam.

20:25.750 --> 20:27.310
All right,clear.

20:27.420 --> 20:29.630
Whoa,wait a minute. She's got a pulse.

20:31.280 --> 20:32.690
Sinus rhythm.

20:33.330 --> 20:34.940
I don't understand, is she dying or
not?

20:35.050 --> 20:35.740
Her heart is beating,

20:35.820 --> 20:38.920
but her brain was deprived of oxygen
for a long time.

20:39.050 --> 20:41.990
It's very likely that she suffered
serious brain injury.

20:42.330 --> 20:45.260
Wow. She can't even die right.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.250
Pressure's stabilized after two liters,

20:48.320 --> 20:51.040
but her crit's still dropping, and did
I mention I hate cheerleaders?

20:51.060 --> 20:51.960
I hate clowns.

20:52.080 --> 20:54.590
-I heard Gates was afraid of
folksingers. -Really?

20:54.680 --> 20:56.610
Two plus guarding with rebound on the
left.

20:56.710 --> 20:59.090
Could be a splenic rupture. Neela,you
writing this down?

20:59.190 --> 21:00.730
Yes,Dr. Crenshaw, I am.

21:00.810 --> 21:01.960
-How do you stand this? -I don't know.

21:02.460 --> 21:04.320
I'm like a battered child. I just keep
coming back for more.

21:04.570 --> 21:06.490
All right,let's bring her up to
whatever OR is open.

21:06.570 --> 21:07.950
Dr. Dubenko will meet you there.

21:08.080 --> 21:11.490
Okay,girls,Tasha's going to surgery
now. Everyone say good-bye and wish her
luck.

21:11.880 --> 21:14.360
I'm really sorry you need surgery and
everything,Tash.

21:14.490 --> 21:18.260
But you should know that we'll have to
replace you for All-Cheer.

21:18.780 --> 21:19.910
Where's my mom?

21:21.200 --> 21:23.840
Hey,she sacrificed her spleen for you
guys. Show some respect.

21:25.340 --> 21:27.440
It's going to be okay.I'll explain
everything as we go.

21:28.060 --> 21:30.340
-Am I going to have a big scar? -Not if
we can help it.

21:30.470 --> 21:32.820
-Let me tell you something about Mom...
-Don't talk like that,okay?

21:32.980 --> 21:34.600
She's not going to die.

21:34.750 --> 21:36.370
This is the best idea she's had in a
long time.

21:36.410 --> 21:38.550
You don't mean that. This is your
mother we're talking about.

21:38.610 --> 21:40.360
You don't know the first thing about my
mother.

21:40.590 --> 21:41.550
I know that she's barely alive,

21:41.690 --> 21:44.370
and I know you guys should be in there
instead of out here fighting in the
hall.

21:46.350 --> 21:48.610
-Sorry,I just don't care. -Why do you
hate her so much?

21:48.790 --> 21:51.460
Ever since Dad died,all she does is try
to make us happy.

21:51.570 --> 21:53.950
Happy,right. By gambling on the
Internet all day?

21:54.160 --> 21:56.000
-It helps her relax. -Shut up!

21:59.270 --> 22:01.160
She started out with a few dollars on
poker.

22:01.250 --> 22:02.740
And by the end of the year, she'd lost
everything.

22:02.830 --> 22:04.480
The crummy cars,the savings from our
dad.

22:04.600 --> 22:05.630
She has a problem.

22:05.760 --> 22:06.750
When they stopped giving her credit,

22:06.850 --> 22:09.520
she took out more cards in our name and
racked up more debt.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.940
$80,000,Evan.We got to live with that
now.

22:12.040 --> 22:15.090
-She was trying to get help. -Stop
making excuses for her!

22:15.190 --> 22:17.410
The house is in foreclosure, Evan.

22:17.490 --> 22:19.690
Next week,you're going to be homeless.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.150
All right,she may be screwed up, but
she's your mother.

22:27.010 --> 22:29.930
That's not good enough. It's not.

22:33.210 --> 22:36.100
-Can I get your advice on something?
-Yeah,of course.

22:37.260 --> 22:40.120
Well,let's say I knew a really nice
person

22:40.210 --> 22:42.290
about to do a pretty bad thing.

22:42.440 --> 22:47.220
But this bad thing had really good
consequences for a bunch of people.

22:48.260 --> 22:49.910
-You don't need my advice. -Yes,I do.

22:50.110 --> 22:53.750
No,no,'cause you have like this ethical
alarm system

22:53.860 --> 22:57.110
hardwired into your brain.Makes you a
self-righteous pain in the ass,

22:57.890 --> 22:59.210
but it's one of the best things about
you.

22:59.290 --> 23:01.120
But... if I tell what I know,

23:02.760 --> 23:04.940
it's going to mess things up for a
whole bunch of people.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.760
They'll get over it.

23:07.790 --> 23:09.760
It will be a major betrayal.

23:09.910 --> 23:12.620
Uh,do the right thing,Neela. That's all
I'm saying.

23:14.620 --> 23:17.910
Is this where I'm having my operation?

23:18.020 --> 23:20.200
Yep. The ORs are straight ahead.

23:22.310 --> 23:23.200
I'm scared.

23:23.340 --> 23:25.630
I know. But we're going to take good
care of you.

23:25.690 --> 23:27.220
My stomach...

23:27.590 --> 23:30.220
Hey,we'll get you more pain medication
when we get to pre-op.

23:30.690 --> 23:32.150
No. That's not it.

23:32.380 --> 23:33.750
Is it your mom?

23:34.060 --> 23:35.850
We won't start until she gets here.

23:36.760 --> 23:39.350
I didn't fall from the top of the
formation.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.580
You didn't?

23:42.410 --> 23:47.460
The other girls...they did this. They
didi this to me.

23:52.530 --> 23:53.910
New cheerleaders are forced to submit
to ten minutes

23:54.000 --> 23:56.250
in an equipment closet in their gym.

23:56.440 --> 23:59.680
The newbie just takes it while her
teammates do whatever they want.

24:00.040 --> 24:02.800
Tasha got kicked in the stomach till
she started coughing up blood.

24:03.220 --> 24:04.920
I trust the authorities have been
notified.

24:05.280 --> 24:07.050
-Ray's on it. -Good.

24:08.220 --> 24:10.450
Lucien,there's something else I need to
talk to you about.

24:10.820 --> 24:12.220
Sure. Go ahead.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.820
-Can it wait? -Not really.

24:15.980 --> 24:16.750
Well,it's going to have to.

24:16.870 --> 24:18.810
Our cases are completely backed up.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.200
Let's go.

24:20.640 --> 24:24.320
Oh,Dr. Kovac, you really must see this.

24:26.020 --> 24:27.640
This is,uh...

24:28.580 --> 24:29.580
Fred and Brenda.

24:29.720 --> 24:32.800
Neurovascular symptoms after a
Handfasting Ceremony.

24:32.910 --> 24:34.350
-A what? -It's a Wiccan wedding.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.100
The guests bound our wrists with cords.

24:36.190 --> 24:38.350
It's where the expression "tie the
knot" comes from.

24:38.910 --> 24:40.790
These are really strong.

24:40.850 --> 24:44.040
Braided to be tough, like our marriage
bond.

24:44.140 --> 24:46.890
Regular scissors didn't work, and the
knots were too tight to undo.

24:47.300 --> 24:49.680
-I can't feel my fingers. -And I can't
move my thumb.

24:49.770 --> 24:52.590
Is a Wiccan ceremony recognized by the
state?

24:52.640 --> 24:55.410
No. We have to get married at the
courthouse so I can put Fred on my
insurance.

24:55.650 --> 24:58.260
They don't recognize us because we
don't believe in mating for life.

24:58.490 --> 24:59.950
Oh,you don't?

24:59.950 --> 25:01.890
We are betrothed for one year and one
day.

25:01.970 --> 25:03.850
To be reevaluated at the end of that
period.

25:04.300 --> 25:07.930
Yeah,well,it does seem like "till
death" is kind of extreme.

25:08.030 --> 25:10.090
Yeah. Just Judeo-Christian bullcrap.

25:11.340 --> 25:13.100
I don't think so.

25:13.610 --> 25:16.940
We're getting married,and all those
things are on our minds.

25:18.960 --> 25:21.520
Sorry. Just slipped out.

25:22.180 --> 25:25.180
Uh... okay. That's all right.

25:25.550 --> 25:28.400
Um,all right,um... I'll be right
back,okay?

25:33.830 --> 25:37.350
What,the first people we tell are
strangers? Wiccans?

25:37.720 --> 25:38.480
I just felt like saying it.

25:38.530 --> 25:40.480
Hey,Abby,have you seen the cheerleading
coach?

25:40.600 --> 25:43.000
She's outside practicing with the
girls.

25:44.380 --> 25:45.750
Oops.

25:47.050 --> 25:50.350
When tissues are deprived of oxygen for
a long time,

25:50.450 --> 25:53.280
they produce acids,so we're giving her
medicine for that.

25:55.210 --> 25:56.860
How long can she live like this?

25:56.950 --> 25:58.830
Weeks. Months. It's hard to tell.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.460
But it's just a matter of time,right?

26:01.790 --> 26:04.060
I mean,if you want to help us,don't
prolong this.

26:04.660 --> 26:06.310
She's not suffering.

26:07.260 --> 26:09.600
Evan and I are going to have to be
responsible for her.

26:09.910 --> 26:12.120
We're the only close family she has.
We're alone.It's too much.

26:12.590 --> 26:14.420
I understand. Social worker will call
you.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.820
We have programs. There's a support
group.

26:17.020 --> 26:19.100
Please. We've been through enoug

26:32.980 --> 26:35.780
She's been having runs of V tach.

26:36.950 --> 26:38.330
Forget the lido drip.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.620
What,you want amiodarone?

26:40.980 --> 26:43.980
No. Why prolong the inevitable?

26:44.350 --> 26:45.580
That's not your call to make.

26:45.670 --> 26:47.280
Oh,come on,Sam,we both know how this
ends.

26:48.060 --> 26:49.560
Why put her boys through it?

26:49.930 --> 26:52.160
She's a full code. We don't know the
extent of her injuries.

26:52.230 --> 26:54.410
We gave her CPR for 40 minutes. Her
brain is fried.

26:57.430 --> 26:58.730
Another run of ten.

27:00.450 --> 27:02.810
Sam,your little raver is having a
dystonic reaction to Haldol.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.610
It's cool. Go.

27:06.130 --> 27:08.680
The lido is hanging and the infuser is
set.

27:08.770 --> 27:10.770
If she has another run, start the
drip,okay?

27:39.980 --> 27:43.920
Page Dr. Kovac and tell him his patient
in Trauma One is coding.

27:44.760 --> 27:45.950
Thanks.

28:09.510 --> 28:11.150
You heard what happened last year.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.550
My girls are not staying in the same
motel as the football team.

28:13.750 --> 28:15.220
I need to talk to you about Tasha.

28:15.580 --> 28:16.720
-How's she doing? -Get off the phone.

28:17.080 --> 28:18.680
I'll call you back.

28:19.050 --> 28:21.520
Tasha's injuries were not caused by a
fall.

28:21.880 --> 28:24.120
What do you mean? I saw her hit the
ground.

28:24.480 --> 28:25.950
She was forced into a closet,

28:26.320 --> 28:27.880
and then she was beaten by the other
girls.

28:27.900 --> 28:30.050
What? My girls would never...

28:30.420 --> 28:31.880
Come on! Don't do this!

28:32.250 --> 28:34.070
She knows you know.

28:35.530 --> 28:36.920
It's not what you think.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.580
Tasha's sensitive. Never really fit in
with the others.

28:39.710 --> 28:42.780
What she's referring to is just a
little team-building exercise we do.

28:43.130 --> 28:45.830
They ripped open her spleen. That's not
little.

28:45.950 --> 28:48.370
And I definitely wouldn't consider that
team-building.

28:49.180 --> 28:52.390
My girls are regional champions.
They're under a lot of pressure.

28:55.680 --> 28:57.900
Why don't you save the excuses for
these guys,all right?

29:02.800 --> 29:04.600
Mom,I don't care what happened. I don't
care about the money.

29:04.710 --> 29:05.990
Just please don't go.

29:06.100 --> 29:08.260
-Another mig of epi. -Charged to 360.
Clear.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.950
Resume compressions.

29:13.320 --> 29:14.550
What were you thinking? Why didn't you
talk to me?

29:14.920 --> 29:16.380
Lido isn't going to change the outcome.

29:16.750 --> 29:17.720
I thought you'd agree.

29:18.080 --> 29:19.320
Yeah,well, we work together here,Gates.

29:19.680 --> 29:21.280
Clear!

29:26.380 --> 29:27.600
I'll be right back.

29:27.610 --> 29:29.520
Gates,you can't leave in the middle of
a code.

29:29.880 --> 29:30.680
The kid should be in here.

29:30.690 --> 29:31.450
Gates!

29:31.820 --> 29:33.180
Hey!

29:33.550 --> 29:34.650
What do you want?

29:34.700 --> 29:36.650
Look,I know you're angry, and I know
you got screwed.

29:36.930 --> 29:38.180
You don't know anything.

29:38.550 --> 29:40.820
I know your dad died, and your mom
messed up.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.180
It ain't fair.

29:42.550 --> 29:43.650
No,it isn't.

29:44.020 --> 29:45.620
But your mom is dying.

29:45.980 --> 29:47.450
And I know you care.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.220
Because,if you didn't,you wouldn't be
out here sulking in the hall.

29:50.750 --> 29:54.280
You go in there and you forgive your
mother right now.

30:00.540 --> 30:02.050
I can't.

30:02.140 --> 30:06.130
Nick,you have one shot at being with
your mother while she's dying.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.640
Hold compressions.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.780
That's enough.

30:40.550 --> 30:42.060
Save a cheerleader, save the world.

30:42.140 --> 30:43.890
Lucien,I still need to talk to you
about that thing.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.270
Well,make it quick. Manish is on the
table, everyone's waiting.

30:46.360 --> 30:48.290
Well,that's what it's about. Emily paid
Manish for his kidney.

30:48.890 --> 30:51.520
-That's ridiculous.He knows better.
-Well,it's true.He told me.

30:51.610 --> 30:53.270
He was screened by psych. They would
have picked this up.

30:53.450 --> 30:55.570
-Well,they didn't. -Come on.

30:56.410 --> 30:59.450
It's wrong,and could jeopardize the
whole transplant program.

30:59.540 --> 31:00.880
All right. All right,Neela.

31:01.250 --> 31:04.150
All right,well,look. Just as an
exercise, consider this.

31:04.250 --> 31:07.600
There are over 65,000 people on the
UNOS list waiting for kidneys.

31:07.770 --> 31:11.150
Can we really rely on voluntary
altruism to solve this problem?

31:11.520 --> 31:13.180
-What are you saying? -What am I
saying?

31:13.240 --> 31:15.440
Well,when somebody donates a kidney,

31:15.510 --> 31:18.380
the recipient obviously benefits,right?

31:18.470 --> 31:20.310
Hospitals make money.

31:20.540 --> 31:21.880
The surgeons get paid.

31:21.990 --> 31:23.610
The donor who gives up a kidney

31:23.740 --> 31:26.300
gets flowers and a handshake. Am I
right?

31:26.910 --> 31:27.980
Are you kidding?

31:28.330 --> 31:30.550
So many sick people, so few organs.

31:30.660 --> 31:32.970
Why not let market forces sort out the
imbalance?

31:33.080 --> 31:35.480
Because people aren't commodities. We
don't live in a world

31:35.630 --> 31:37.980
where it's all right for rich people to
buy body parts from those less
fortunate.

31:39.050 --> 31:42.050
Hey,it's legal to rent out your uterus,
or to harvest your eggs for money.

31:42.440 --> 31:45.210
You can get paid to donate sperm. How
is this different?

31:45.280 --> 31:48.420
All I know is thata dying girl is going
to get a new kidney today.

31:48.480 --> 31:52.190
Then what happens to the 65,000 others
who can't afford to buy one?

32:00.090 --> 32:02.040
Ancef will be ready to run soon.

32:03.510 --> 32:06.750
Quick question. Why are you doing this?

32:06.920 --> 32:08.300
Excuse me?

32:08.430 --> 32:11.660
Why are you giving this girl your
kidney?

32:15.050 --> 32:17.550
I guess I've been inspired by the work
that we do here.

32:17.680 --> 32:22.160
Mm-hmm. And you would never dream of
jeopardizing everything

32:22.250 --> 32:25.330
by doing something stupid and
illegal,would you?

32:25.610 --> 32:26.350
What are you talking about?

32:26.430 --> 32:28.510
You know exactly what he's talking
about.

32:36.460 --> 32:40.760
Okay,Emily wanted to give me money,

32:40.870 --> 32:43.270
but I turned her down after talking to
Neela.

32:43.370 --> 32:46.630
Money was never part of the reason why
I wanted to do any of this.

32:46.780 --> 32:48.810
Lucien,he's just saying what he knows
you need to hear.

32:49.020 --> 32:50.220
She's obviously made up her mind about
me.

32:50.320 --> 32:51.930
I don't know what else to say.

32:52.130 --> 32:54.300
All right. That's enough.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.190
Neela,let's go scrub.

32:56.910 --> 32:59.920
No. I won't be a part of this.

33:03.130 --> 33:08.240
Fine. Shirley,have Crenshaw get me a
surgeon who actually wants to operate.

33:08.850 --> 33:11.110
You get out of here Nella,now.

33:17.350 --> 33:19.480
The tornado was hard to see against the
background,

33:19.850 --> 33:20.880
so I painted it black.

33:21.250 --> 33:22.570
I was going to put some lights in the
bottom,

33:22.660 --> 33:24.230
but I ran out of time.

33:24.350 --> 33:26.860
Wow,that should look really,really
cool. Sam.

33:26.970 --> 33:29.350
Yeah,and I fell down the stairs at
school and it broke.

33:29.480 --> 33:31.650
That's not the only thing you broke.

33:31.750 --> 33:34.160
I know-- I broke my tibia and my
fibula.

33:34.280 --> 33:35.760
Can you fix it fast?

33:35.870 --> 33:38.600
-I can fix you up in about an hour. -An
hour?!

33:38.940 --> 33:42.460
I'll never have time to finish my
tornado before the end of the science
fair.

33:42.830 --> 33:45.810
Hey,did you know that casts give off
heat when they're hardening?

33:45.940 --> 33:47.850
-No. -Mm-hmm.

33:47.880 --> 33:51.730
It's called an exothermic reaction. It
could make a pretty cool science
project.

33:51.950 --> 33:53.460
Can you help me make it?!

33:53.610 --> 33:55.980
Uh,sure. I'll get the stuff.

33:56.590 --> 33:59.410
-Sam,can you dispose of the rest of
that Ativan,please? -Sure.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.240
-Hi. -Hi.

34:01.410 --> 34:03.680
-So,I talked to your neurologist,
-Uh-huh.

34:04.050 --> 34:07.050
and I got quite an eful about temporal
lobe epilepsy.

34:07.420 --> 34:08.520
Yeah. Interesting stuff.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.350
-Well,I told you I was the real deal.
-Mmmm.

34:11.719 --> 34:14.250
Well,do you have any last words of
psychic wisdom

34:14.620 --> 34:17.250
before I medicate you and sever your
ties to the paranormal?

34:17.620 --> 34:18.880
Oh,sure.

34:19.250 --> 34:23.080
Um,well,I see great things for you in
the year to come,

34:23.110 --> 34:27.639
although you will struggle to...
balance home and career.

34:29.710 --> 34:31.370
-That's it? -Yeah.

34:33.520 --> 34:36.030
That's the most generic fortune I've
ever heard.

34:37.850 --> 34:41.630
And you should really invite your dad
to the wedding.

34:47.159 --> 34:49.090
I'm just saying.

34:53.530 --> 34:54.360
-Gates. -Hm?

34:54.440 --> 34:56.800
-Can you explain this,please? -Explain
what?

34:56.909 --> 35:00.100
Why did you write "idiopathic liver
failure" on her death certificate
worksheet?

35:00.170 --> 35:02.200
It should be "carbon tetrachloride
ingestion."

35:02.320 --> 35:04.580
Well,she never admitted it
straight-out.

35:04.830 --> 35:06.450
We don't know what really happened.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.900
You can't withhold information whenever
it suits you.

35:09.010 --> 35:11.750
What she told you needs to be part of
the medical record.

35:12.220 --> 35:15.940
If we document suicidality, then life
insurance won't pay.

35:16.750 --> 35:18.610
We say it was a natural death-- what's
the harm?

35:18.680 --> 35:21.490
The harm is that it's unethical, and
it's insurance fraud.

35:21.580 --> 35:24.610
Oh,come on,insurance companies screw
people over any chance they get.

35:25.100 --> 35:26.710
And why should those kids be punished
for the rest of their life

35:26.770 --> 35:28.530
because of something their mother did?

35:28.620 --> 35:30.790
Gates,I'm worried about you.Don't worry
abou4 me.I'm all right.

35:30.880 --> 35:33.170
No,I'm worried about your ability to do
this job.

35:33.260 --> 35:35.660
And it's too bad because you're good,
but you-you...

35:36.240 --> 35:38.650
you lie and you think nothing of it.

35:40.420 --> 35:42.880
It's not lying if we don't know for
sure.

35:45.950 --> 35:49.810
Now,come on,let their mother do this
one last thing for them.

35:54.950 --> 35:56.750
I'm not going to let you lie for
them,Gates.

36:03.280 --> 36:05.510
-Hey,Gates,can you sign this discharge?
-Later.

36:33.520 --> 36:35.080
Jane,you seen Neela?

36:36.710 --> 36:38.990
Uh,Dubenko sent her home early. Oh.

36:39.540 --> 36:43.140
I just had to wheel an appy up from the
ER, in case you're wondering.

36:45.790 --> 36:48.190
-Wondering what? -Why I'm here.

36:50.270 --> 36:51.680
Good night,Jane.

36:57.280 --> 37:01.570
King-sized,wrought iron frame. The rest
is up to you.

37:02.230 --> 37:04.240
Hey,you guys, have you seen Tony
around?

37:04.330 --> 37:07.280
-Not in a while. -Okay,have a good
night.

37:07.350 --> 37:10.870
-Do you think I chased away my father
too fast? -No.

37:11.740 --> 37:14.150
Maybe I should've at least listened to
what he had to say.

37:14.230 --> 37:16.620
-Why? You can call him. -I tried.

37:17.240 --> 37:20.190
He checked out of his hotel--the number
he gave me in Texas is disconnected.

37:20.260 --> 37:24.010
Um,Abby,uh...Sorry,I just need a minute
to check something,okay?

37:25.680 --> 37:28.190
Hey,Malik,do we still have the chart on
Anna Hayes?

37:28.520 --> 37:31.210
You think I memorize the name of every
patient who comes through here?

37:31.250 --> 37:33.330
The woman that died of liver failure.

37:33.450 --> 37:36.050
I forgot to do some paperwork for the
death certificate.

37:41.420 --> 37:42.520
-Here you go. -Thanks.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.320
Hey,first day back. How'd it go?

37:44.680 --> 37:47.050
Just like riding a bike.

37:47.420 --> 37:50.220
Luka,I told Miranda we'd be home by
8:00.

37:50.580 --> 37:52.280
Coming.

37:52.950 --> 37:58.210
CAUSE OF liver failure of unknown et
iology

37:58.410 --> 38:00.200
-Good night. -See ya.

38:01.710 --> 38:03.100
-Hey. -Hey.

38:03.190 --> 38:04.770
How'd it go with your little secret?

38:04.850 --> 38:08.360
Oh,terrible,actually. Worse than
expected. But our cheerleader did
well,though.

38:08.590 --> 38:11.570
The police are interviewing the whole
squad as well as the coach,so...

38:11.580 --> 38:13.790
-Oh,good. -Getting off soon?

38:13.960 --> 38:16.140
-Uh,yeah,thank God. -Yeah,me,too.

38:16.670 --> 38:18.420
Want to grab a beer?

38:20.210 --> 38:24.370
Sounds good,but,um... I've got some
dictations to do.

38:24.550 --> 38:26.540
Okay. Another time.

38:29.730 --> 38:31.780
-Dr. Gates. -You're still here.

38:32.830 --> 38:36.240
Yeah. Our uncle drove in from Ann
Arbor. He wanted to see her.

38:37.390 --> 38:39.320
I'm sorry for your loss.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.210
You know,I never got to thank you for
everything you did.

38:43.330 --> 38:44.970
It's my job.

38:45.790 --> 38:47.310
You really helped us.

38:47.980 --> 38:50.180
Yeah. Good night,Nick.

38:52.250 --> 38:54.500
You know,she knew it was the only way
out.

38:55.060 --> 38:57.930
Had to look natural so we could get the
insurance money.

38:59.290 --> 39:01.800
I found some old solvent at the store.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.520
You helped her?

39:08.210 --> 39:10.120
I left out a bottle.

39:13.260 --> 39:16.330
At least she finally got something
right.

39:17.850 --> 39:20.120
Good night,Doc.

39:27.300 --> 39:28.230
Leave me alone.

39:28.300 --> 39:30.940
No,you can't break and steal
things,Alex--you know that.

39:31.050 --> 39:32.360
You do that,you're going to end up on
the wrong track...

39:32.510 --> 39:35.570
Mom,you're not in my head,okay?

39:35.620 --> 39:37.370
You-you don't know what happened!

39:39.690 --> 39:41.260
Alex,come on.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.960
Alex! Open this door!

39:44.600 --> 39:45.670
You hear me?

39:45.790 --> 39:47.140
Right now!

39:47.750 --> 39:49.850
-Open the door! -Go away!

39:50.580 --> 39:53.190
I can't go away-- I'm your mom!

39:54.300 --> 39:57.380
Come on,Alex, don't do this to me.

39:58.770 --> 40:01.110
Hey,do you remember that time that,uh,

40:01.220 --> 40:04.430
we made that science project for your
school,that volcano?

40:04.720 --> 40:08.400
And I couldn't get the mix of,uh, of
baking soda and vinegar right?

40:08.480 --> 40:10.670
And it erupted all over the living
room.

40:14.400 --> 40:17.780
What were you,what, five or six?

40:27.410 --> 40:31.180
I know I didn't give you the most
stable childhood,okay?

40:32.250 --> 40:34.570
I know you've seen a lot of crazy
stuff,

40:34.740 --> 40:36.810
that is mostly my fault.

40:41.980 --> 40:45.560
But the only thing I ever wanted was
for you to be happy,Alex.

40:47.250 --> 40:49.180
Okay?

40:49.250 --> 40:51.660
And I don't know how to give that to
you.

40:54.110 --> 40:56.160
So,please...

40:56.710 --> 40:59.000
tell me what to do.

41:08.530 --> 41:11.520
I know you're listening in
there,Alex,okay?

41:15.620 --> 41:17.410
I love you.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.710
You know that,right?

41:31.330 --> 41:31.960
Hi.

41:32.070 --> 41:34.680
-Hi. -You look tired.

41:34.730 --> 41:38.040
-Want a beer? -Yeah,thanks.

41:41.500 --> 41:45.180
I made chili,salad and corn bread from
scratch.

41:46.730 --> 41:50.180
I know what your next question is. My
homework's already done.

41:51.280 --> 41:52.570
All right.

41:53.520 --> 41:55.610
No more fast food around here.

41:59.070 --> 42:00.670
Wow,Sarah, this looks great.

42:01.360 --> 42:02.880
Yeah.

42:30.970 --> 42:32.710
Leaving so soon?

42:35.220 --> 42:36.100
Guess not.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
