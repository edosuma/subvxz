02:45.580 --> 02:48.580
     (door creaking, gasps)

03:30.560 --> 03:34.130
         (techno music)

04:16.870 --> 04:20.209
      (tense violin music)

04:27.950 --> 04:30.290
          (baby crying)

04:30.290 --> 04:32.050
       - Go back to sleep.

04:33.090 --> 04:34.560
         - Are you sure?

04:45.670 --> 04:49.770
         - Shh... Shh...

04:49.770 --> 04:53.540
         Shh... Shh....

04:55.480 --> 04:59.110
          Shh... Shh...

04:59.120 --> 05:04.050
          Shh... Shh...
       It's okay, Andrew.

05:04.690 --> 05:06.150
          Daddy's here.

05:07.420 --> 05:11.490
       (suspenseful music)

05:28.110 --> 05:30.410
         (bell ringing)

05:31.880 --> 05:33.880
   How's your mom doing, Ray?

05:35.490 --> 05:36.720
             - Okay.

05:40.990 --> 05:44.030
     - What about your dad?
        - What about him?

05:45.330 --> 05:48.460
   - Do you want to talk about
      how things have been
      since he's been out?

05:51.500 --> 05:54.140
              - No.
         (bell ringing)

05:55.640 --> 05:57.070
       - Was it worth it?

06:01.980 --> 06:03.980
     I could recommend that
      they not suspend you,

06:03.980 --> 06:06.280
    but you gotta promise me
     this is the last time.

06:11.820 --> 06:13.550
   Do you even want to finish
          high school?

06:13.560 --> 06:16.760
         (bell ringing)
          - Eat a dick.

06:19.030 --> 06:19.860
    - What about your uncle?

06:23.830 --> 06:26.230
       Has he been around
 since the last time we talked?

06:35.750 --> 06:36.940
             Kelly?

06:39.120 --> 06:41.080
         (bell ringing)

06:45.890 --> 06:48.060
      He thinks you'll get
        the scholarship?

06:48.060 --> 06:50.630
    - What can I say, Mr. C?
        I'm good at math.

06:50.630 --> 06:53.590
   - Wow. That's great, Chris.

06:53.600 --> 06:54.860
     What does your mom say?

06:56.070 --> 06:59.030
    - Eh, it's hard for her,
            you know?

06:59.040 --> 07:01.370
  Without my dad being around,

07:02.310 --> 07:04.470
   and she doesn't really have
          anyone else,

07:04.470 --> 07:06.270
  so having me at home, well...

07:06.280 --> 07:07.640
        - It's a comfort.

07:08.410 --> 07:09.640
             - Yeah.

07:11.750 --> 07:13.210
    I don't want to leave her
             alone.

07:13.980 --> 07:16.820
- Well, she has to see that this
   is the best thing for you.

07:16.820 --> 07:18.320
      This is your chance.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.320
    - I know, I know, it's...

07:21.490 --> 07:23.720
 What if I go and she's just...?

07:25.400 --> 07:29.660
       You know, or, um...
       uh, I can't handle
       the workload, or...

07:30.430 --> 07:32.070
   all the rich kids hate me.

07:32.070 --> 07:34.300
 - None of that's gonna happen,
              okay?

07:34.300 --> 07:37.140
 If you want, I can come to your
   house and talk to your mom.

07:37.140 --> 07:40.510
           - Can you?
        - For you, I can.

07:43.180 --> 07:44.750
        - Thanks, Mr. C,

07:45.320 --> 07:46.880
   but I'll handle it myself.

07:48.020 --> 07:49.550
              Uh...

07:51.190 --> 07:53.090
              Here.

07:53.090 --> 07:56.160
       It was really good.
      - Glad you liked it.
         (bell ringing)

08:02.830 --> 08:04.270
   (door opening and closing)

08:04.630 --> 08:06.370
        How was he today?

08:06.370 --> 08:08.100
             - Busy.

08:16.980 --> 08:18.080
              Look.

08:19.650 --> 08:21.720
          - Holy shit.

08:23.450 --> 08:24.720
           (soft sigh)
             - Ohh.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.390
    - My mom called earlier.

08:27.860 --> 08:30.420
    She offered to come stay
     after the baby's born.

08:34.630 --> 08:36.200
       - Let's see, okay?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.799
 I want to try this on our own.

08:40.740 --> 08:42.870
   - I just wanted you to know
        it was an option.

09:29.390 --> 09:30.820
             - Ohh.

09:35.460 --> 09:37.260
           Sweetheart?

09:40.560 --> 09:42.030
             Honey.

09:47.640 --> 09:50.610
            Ohh. Ohh.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.480
          (soft gasps)

09:58.580 --> 10:00.180
              Evan!

10:01.250 --> 10:04.590
     (exhales, gasps, moans)

10:04.590 --> 10:06.520
    (medical machine beeping)

10:11.260 --> 10:12.490
            (exhales)

10:12.500 --> 10:15.860
   - You're doing great, baby.
           (loud moan)

10:17.800 --> 10:19.630
  - You might want to come over
           here, Dad.

10:19.640 --> 10:22.900
        Okay, Mom, ready?
         (pained moans)

10:22.910 --> 10:26.070
           Push. Push.

10:26.080 --> 10:31.980
        Push. Push. Push.
             (moans)

10:31.980 --> 10:42.020
        Push. Push. Push.

10:42.030 --> 10:46.530
        Push. Push. Push
            (screams)

10:46.530 --> 10:49.800
             (moans)

10:49.800 --> 10:53.600
      (gasps, baby crying)

11:18.160 --> 11:22.030
      - Hello. Hello, sir.

11:23.070 --> 11:25.100
      Welcome to the world.

11:29.070 --> 11:31.710
       - Hello, my loves.
       - Mom, you made it.

11:31.710 --> 11:34.410
             (gasps)
         - There he is!

11:34.410 --> 11:38.080
    Ohh! Isn't he beautiful?

11:38.550 --> 11:41.150
    - Marie! You need to wash
           your hands.

11:41.150 --> 11:45.390
        - Oh! Of course.
     I'm sorry, sweetheart.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.860
      And how's Mom doing?

11:47.860 --> 11:49.320
            - Great.

11:51.230 --> 11:55.330
           (soft gasp)
     - Look at this big boy.

11:55.330 --> 11:58.530
     How much does he weigh?
   - Seven and a half pounds.

11:58.530 --> 12:00.940
  - Seven pounds, five ounces,
            actually.

12:00.940 --> 12:04.340
     - Evan was nine pounds.
         (soft chuckle)

12:04.340 --> 12:06.940
    That was quite the labor.

12:09.250 --> 12:13.150
       But he was so calm,
       never made a peep.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.050
           Ohh. Shh...
          (baby crying)

12:16.050 --> 12:18.290
          There you go.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.060
              Shh.

12:21.060 --> 12:23.420
    Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

12:26.300 --> 12:29.030
           (soft gasp)
             - Shh.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.870
    (sharp intake of breath)
               Ow.

12:32.470 --> 12:35.740
     - Not like that. Here.

12:35.740 --> 12:38.140
          (baby crying)

12:45.110 --> 12:48.250
  - Nurse, may I suggest being
      a little more gentle?

12:48.250 --> 12:51.390
    This is their first baby.
     - Ma'am, may I suggest
      you let me do my job?

12:51.390 --> 12:53.490
 Because if she can't feed him,
        the baby'll lose

12:53.490 --> 12:55.220
    too much weight, and then
    we'll have to intervene.

12:59.430 --> 13:02.630
        There. Like that.

13:06.770 --> 13:08.970
- Well, she's quite the charmer.

13:10.470 --> 13:12.440
         Evan, honey...

13:12.440 --> 13:16.380
     Why don't I go pick up
  some food for everyone, hmm?

13:17.480 --> 13:21.280
 Everything is going to be fine,
     sweetheart, you'll see.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.580
   And if you need me to come
      and stay for a while,

13:23.590 --> 13:25.490
    you know there's nothing
         I'd rather do.

13:25.490 --> 13:27.860
      - That's okay, Marie.

13:28.620 --> 13:30.830
      I think we'll manage
           on our own.

13:30.830 --> 13:33.430
      - Yeah, thanks, Mom,
          we got this.

13:34.930 --> 13:36.230
             - Hmm.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.370
          - Hi, Andrew.

13:41.440 --> 13:43.170
        This is your dad.

13:44.140 --> 13:47.810
       First of all, many
 congratulations on being born.

13:47.810 --> 13:51.950
       It looked painful,
    and a little disgusting.

13:51.950 --> 13:55.120
   But you made it. Well done.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.850
       I thought we could
      take this opportunity

13:58.860 --> 14:01.960
     to have a little chat,
          mano a mano.

14:03.790 --> 14:05.560
     I will never hurt you.

14:08.730 --> 14:10.460
     I will never judge you.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.930
   And I will never leave you.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.370
 I'm not gonna let anything bad
         happen to you.

14:20.980 --> 14:24.080
(church bells ringing, birdsong)

14:50.270 --> 14:53.670
          (baby crying)
             - Shh.

14:54.580 --> 14:57.080
    - Should we try a bottle?
              - No.

14:57.550 --> 14:58.580
   If we give him the bottle,

14:58.580 --> 15:00.150
        he won't go back
        to breastfeeding.

15:01.350 --> 15:04.320
       - Okay, sweetheart.
             - Shh.

15:05.790 --> 15:07.250
          - Can I help?

15:07.260 --> 15:09.620
      - Not unless you can
      grow a pair of tits.

15:11.090 --> 15:12.690
    - I'll get right on that.

15:13.730 --> 15:17.230
          (baby crying)

15:17.230 --> 15:19.530
             (gasps)
   - Come on, Andrew, come on.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.270
          (sharp gasp)
            (crying)

15:25.140 --> 15:28.440
    He's not gaining weight.
            (gasping)

15:32.320 --> 15:34.620
 Why won't you let me help you?

15:34.620 --> 15:36.550
         (crying softly)

15:40.490 --> 15:44.560
           Here, baby.
   (baby's cries overlapping)

15:58.510 --> 16:02.280
    (baby crying in distance)

16:02.280 --> 16:05.510
         (intense music)

16:14.260 --> 16:16.360
       (voices whispering)

16:17.360 --> 16:19.930
           (distorted)
 - ...kill you, you little shit!

16:22.330 --> 16:24.100
  - Get the fuck away from him.

16:24.670 --> 16:28.400
     Evan, go to your room.
          (man grunts)

16:33.510 --> 16:36.210
    - I'm-- I'm sorry, Marie.
  I didn't-- I didn't mean to.

16:36.210 --> 16:37.580
           - Get out.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.180
  - You know I didn't mean it,
          right, Evan?

16:43.890 --> 16:47.450
- I promise you, I will kill you
 if you don't leave immediately.

16:57.470 --> 16:59.630
    You're okay, sweetheart,
   everything's gonna be okay.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.270
             (kiss)

17:03.170 --> 17:06.109
       Mother's here. Shh.

17:08.180 --> 17:10.380
              <i> Shh.</i>

17:11.880 --> 17:14.210
       (Marie whispering):
    <i> You're okay, sweetheart.</i>

17:15.579 --> 17:17.819
      <i> Everything is okay.</i>

17:17.819 --> 17:21.260
           (soft gasp)
             <i> Shh...</i>

17:22.560 --> 17:26.960
           <i> Shh. Shh.</i>

17:36.710 --> 17:39.570
    - I hope you don't mind,
        I let myself in.

17:41.040 --> 17:43.080
    - Let me know if it gets
       too cold at night.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.510
         - I will, dear.

17:46.020 --> 17:47.450
           Thank you.

17:51.020 --> 17:53.450
    How are you doing, Evan?

17:54.060 --> 17:56.520
           - I'm good.
      I'm always good, Mom.

18:01.730 --> 18:03.000
             - Sit.

18:06.700 --> 18:08.100
            Tell me.

18:08.740 --> 18:10.600
       - I'm okay, really.

18:11.570 --> 18:12.940
          But Lauren...

18:13.740 --> 18:16.210
  - It's hard for new mothers.

18:16.210 --> 18:18.780
  How can you take care of her
           and Andrew,

18:18.780 --> 18:22.280
     if you don't take care
          of yourself?

18:23.620 --> 18:25.550
     It's okay, my darling.

18:27.220 --> 18:29.690
 Everything is going to be okay.

18:30.730 --> 18:31.960
         Mother's here.

18:35.660 --> 18:38.470
        (muffled speech)

18:47.840 --> 18:49.080
            - Mr. C?

18:50.450 --> 18:52.650
         Hey. You okay?

18:55.250 --> 18:56.980
         - Sorry, buddy.

18:58.190 --> 19:00.820
   Baby isn't really sleeping.
        It's just, um...

19:01.960 --> 19:04.760
       Just is what it is.
            You know?

19:05.430 --> 19:07.260
 What's going on with your dad?
            Any news?

19:08.130 --> 19:09.660
           - Oh, um...

19:13.970 --> 19:15.340
           For Andrew.

19:16.710 --> 19:18.240
          - Wow, Chris.

19:20.310 --> 19:21.680
  You know you didn't have to.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.610
       - After everything
       you've done for me?

19:23.610 --> 19:24.850
          Yeah, I did.

19:26.980 --> 19:30.520
      - So, has there been
     any word from your dad?

19:32.820 --> 19:34.790
         (bell ringing)

19:34.790 --> 19:36.190
             - Um...

19:39.230 --> 19:40.930
  Try to get some sleep, okay?

19:43.700 --> 19:45.370
         (door opening)

19:50.740 --> 19:52.270
             (sighs)

20:11.990 --> 20:13.890
       (over headphones):
<i>I hope you can understand, man.</i>

20:13.900 --> 20:16.100
     <i> I don't think you know</i>
        <i> what it's like.</i>

20:17.500 --> 20:19.430
     (indistinct muttering)
    <i> You know, I lost my job,</i>

20:19.440 --> 20:21.030
        <i> I was drinkin'.</i>

20:21.040 --> 20:22.770
<i>You know how it is, right, man?</i>

20:22.770 --> 20:24.610
   <i> When your wife's screaming</i>
            <i> at you,</i>

20:24.610 --> 20:26.670
      <i> and your kids start</i>
         <i> mouthing off.</i>

20:26.680 --> 20:30.210
       <i> So I just hit 'em.</i>
    <i> And I kept hitting 'em.</i>

20:30.210 --> 20:33.610
  <i> It was like something broke</i>
  <i> inside and I couldn't stop.</i>

20:33.620 --> 20:36.880
      <i> I really didn't mean</i>
  <i> to hurt anyone. Please, man.</i>

20:36.890 --> 20:39.250
 <i> I never meant to hurt anyone.</i>

20:39.260 --> 20:42.260
           <i> This rage,</i>
     <i> it just comes over me.</i>

20:42.260 --> 20:45.460
 <i> Deep down, I'm a good person.</i>
       (knocking on door)

20:54.540 --> 20:56.300
       - I'm the oldest...

20:58.110 --> 20:59.970
        So I can take it.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.880
    But he came after James.

21:05.110 --> 21:07.250
        So I stepped in.

21:07.250 --> 21:08.620
             (sighs)

21:09.080 --> 21:11.990
        - You know I have
    to report this, legally.

21:13.460 --> 21:14.590
    They may send him back in

21:14.590 --> 21:16.390
          if he's found
     in violation of parole.

21:17.390 --> 21:18.890
   How do you feel about that?

21:19.760 --> 21:23.000
        (sniffs, coughs)
           - Whatever.

21:25.630 --> 21:27.700
    He gets what he deserves,
             right?

21:31.410 --> 21:34.980
             - Ray,
   everything's gonna be okay.

22:34.340 --> 22:36.800
         (intense music)

23:06.900 --> 23:08.970
     (laughter in distance)

23:11.940 --> 23:13.110
           (man): Hey!

23:16.180 --> 23:17.310
            Fuck you.

23:18.510 --> 23:19.810
            Fuck you!

23:20.550 --> 23:22.280
    You're a fuckin' traitor!

23:31.460 --> 23:32.990
             (spits)

23:48.380 --> 23:51.380
   (car door opens and closes)

23:56.320 --> 23:58.650
          - Hey, buddy.
        Let me help you.

24:06.230 --> 24:08.260
  Hey. Hey, are you all right?

24:08.260 --> 24:09.760
             - Huh?
       - You need a ride?

24:09.770 --> 24:11.670
   - What, are you queer? Huh?

24:11.670 --> 24:13.170
       - No, I'm a driver.

24:13.640 --> 24:15.340
  Looks like you need some help
          getting home.

24:17.310 --> 24:19.610
    Everyone could use a ride
          now and then.

24:19.610 --> 24:21.040
           No charge.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.380
- "What about immigrant rights?"

24:30.920 --> 24:33.390
  What about my fuckin' rights?

24:34.590 --> 24:38.430
             (sighs)
        Fuckin' wetbacks.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.360
           Fuck that.

24:45.970 --> 24:50.200
    Fuckin' everywhere, man.
  Every fuckin' where you look.

24:50.210 --> 24:52.070
      Everywhere you look.

24:59.310 --> 25:02.880
  It's time the white man took
     this country back, hmm?

25:02.890 --> 25:04.520
          You hear me?

25:05.220 --> 25:06.720
          - I hear you.

25:08.720 --> 25:10.790
     - Left here, left here.

25:10.790 --> 25:12.730
          Stay in here.

25:18.170 --> 25:20.300
       (crickets chirping)

25:44.760 --> 25:46.890
    You got anything to drink
            in there?

26:19.290 --> 26:21.160
          (soft groan)

26:28.370 --> 26:30.100
   - Nobody knows you're here?

26:30.610 --> 26:33.040
       - Been here a year.
      I never seen anyone.

26:33.640 --> 26:35.710
     Make yourself at home.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.050
            (grunts)

26:40.120 --> 26:42.150
          (soft groans)

26:49.760 --> 26:51.830
         What the fuck?

26:53.300 --> 26:55.400
    Oh yeah, very funny, man.

26:56.160 --> 26:57.860
        Let me go, okay?

27:00.100 --> 27:02.270
 Let me go, you fucking psycho!

27:02.270 --> 27:04.370
        (groans, coughs)

27:07.480 --> 27:09.340
     Why are you doing this?

27:15.450 --> 27:17.150
        - Louis Jackson.

27:18.620 --> 27:20.250
       (breathes heavily)

27:22.620 --> 27:25.030
         - Come on, man,
     you got the wrong guy.

27:25.030 --> 27:27.830
      Just let me go, okay?
  I won't tell anyone anything.

27:27.830 --> 27:30.000
        I don't even know
          who you are.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.170
   - Do you know who this is?

27:34.170 --> 27:35.770
          (man scoffs)

27:36.540 --> 27:39.170
   - What'd that little faggot
        say to you? Hmm?

27:39.710 --> 27:43.510
      - By "little faggot,"
       you mean your son?

27:43.510 --> 27:45.680
    - Fuck you! You fucking--

27:47.220 --> 27:48.620
             (spits)

27:48.620 --> 27:49.680
            (coughs)

27:49.690 --> 27:52.920
       (spitting, laughs)

27:53.820 --> 27:55.720
            Oh, yeah.

27:56.390 --> 27:59.430
   You're pretty tough against
       a guy tied up, hmm?

28:00.800 --> 28:05.070
     Why don't you untie me,
    see how easy it is then?

28:05.070 --> 28:09.370
- As easy as a grown man beating
  the shit out of a young boy?

28:10.640 --> 28:14.740
       As easy as a father
  taking his big, ex-con fists,

28:14.740 --> 28:17.610
     and pounding them into
   the flesh of his firstborn?

28:18.350 --> 28:21.480
     - Fuck you, you fucking
      cocksucker, fuck you!

28:21.480 --> 28:22.980
           (groaning)
            No, ohh!

28:22.980 --> 28:24.850
            (gasping)

28:24.850 --> 28:27.250
        Okay, okay. Fuck.

28:27.860 --> 28:30.320
      I'm sorr-- I'm sorry,
      I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28:30.330 --> 28:31.730
           - Louis...

28:32.660 --> 28:36.060
      Please describe to me
   the feelings and sensations

28:36.060 --> 28:38.260
         you experience
     when beating your son.

28:38.870 --> 28:39.970
            (gasping)

28:43.210 --> 28:46.640
      - I never meant to--
    to hurt them, okay? I...

28:48.680 --> 28:51.750
    I just got this thing...
          inside of me.

28:51.750 --> 28:54.210
 It builds and it builds, and--

28:54.220 --> 28:58.080
     and the kids, they push
  and they push and they push,
            you know?

28:59.090 --> 29:01.190
      And-- and then it has
          to come out,

29:01.190 --> 29:02.560
     and I gotta let it out.

29:02.560 --> 29:03.960
            You know?

29:05.930 --> 29:09.130
   I would never hurt my boys,
              okay?

29:10.730 --> 29:13.530
   You understand that, right?

29:18.240 --> 29:20.110
        - Of course I do.

29:22.710 --> 29:24.080
            (groans)

29:24.080 --> 29:25.710
            (gasping)

29:27.580 --> 29:29.380
   Thank you for sharing, Lou.

29:31.390 --> 29:33.020
            (gasping)

29:39.660 --> 29:42.460
     (intense techno music)

30:33.380 --> 30:34.880
        - Where'd you go?

30:36.280 --> 30:38.590
     - Just went for a drive
        to clear my head.

30:39.720 --> 30:40.920
             - Hmm.

30:52.030 --> 30:53.870
 - Coach let me go into practice
          a little late

30:53.870 --> 30:55.800
     so I can pick up James
     and bring him with me.

30:55.800 --> 30:58.540
    - That's great news, Ray.
          And your mom?

30:59.070 --> 31:00.470
    - She's been doin' great.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.580
             I mean,
  since my dad took off again.

31:03.650 --> 31:05.040
     - I'm glad to hear it.

31:11.890 --> 31:13.250
         Where's Andrew?

31:13.260 --> 31:15.220
    - He's with his grandma.

31:20.030 --> 31:21.490
       You're home early.

31:22.730 --> 31:24.100
         - I got lucky.

31:25.070 --> 31:27.100
 Maybe it'll happen twice today.

31:28.200 --> 31:30.640
    - The doctor said we have
            to wait.

31:31.440 --> 31:32.940
       - It's a long wait.

31:36.010 --> 31:38.080
    You look good, you know?

31:41.220 --> 31:43.080
         - No, I don't.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.080
  - You do, you look beautiful.

31:46.720 --> 31:48.290
     I know it's been hard.

31:52.130 --> 31:53.760
        - I'm sorry, I...

31:55.200 --> 31:56.960
      I've been difficult.

31:56.970 --> 32:00.030
   - Shh. You've been a champ.

32:02.470 --> 32:04.700
  - I thought he wasn't eating,
             and...

32:05.310 --> 32:07.610
       that fucking nurse
  saying I was doing it wrong,

32:07.610 --> 32:09.910
       and all the studies
     say how bad formula is,

32:09.910 --> 32:10.980
        and I thought...

32:12.380 --> 32:13.880
         ...this is it.

32:15.650 --> 32:17.020
          I'm failing.

32:19.890 --> 32:21.960
 I'm failing at being a mother.

32:23.390 --> 32:26.460
       - Forget the nurse
     and the studies. Okay?

32:27.060 --> 32:28.660
     You're a great mother.

32:29.400 --> 32:30.830
     - You don't know, Evan.

32:32.300 --> 32:33.670
   You sleep most of the night
 and go to work during the day,

32:33.670 --> 32:35.170
  and it's just me and Andrew,

32:35.170 --> 32:37.300
   and I thought... I thought
  I was doing everything wrong,

32:37.310 --> 32:39.170
      and I thought if I--
    if I can't do this right,

32:39.170 --> 32:40.570
       you would take him
       and leave me alone,

32:40.580 --> 32:42.010
      and I can't be alone.

32:43.980 --> 32:45.350
           Not again.

32:48.280 --> 32:50.820
   I won't let Andrew grow up
        without a family.

32:54.620 --> 32:56.160
        - Neither will I.

32:57.090 --> 32:58.860
    I'll never leave you two.

33:08.300 --> 33:10.970
       (TV in background)

33:10.970 --> 33:12.140
             (sighs)

33:12.140 --> 33:13.610
        - Can you please
        tell your mother

33:13.610 --> 33:15.340
  not to watch TV with Andrew?

33:17.980 --> 33:21.050
   (TV): <i> Have you tried every</i>
 <i> fad diet, one after the other?</i>

33:21.050 --> 33:23.350
      <i> We've done them all.</i>

33:23.350 --> 33:26.050
    - Oh, you're your daddy's
 little man, aren't you, Andrew?

33:26.050 --> 33:28.290
      So handsome already.

33:28.290 --> 33:29.460
             - Mom.

33:30.130 --> 33:31.490
          - Yes, dear?

33:31.490 --> 33:34.290
    - Lauren doesn't want you
      watching with Andrew.

33:34.300 --> 33:35.960
   - It won't hurt him, dear.

33:35.960 --> 33:37.860
      He doesn't even know
           what it is.

33:38.330 --> 33:40.070
 - Mom, Lauren doesn't like it.

33:52.910 --> 33:54.950
    - You need to be careful
            with her.

33:56.820 --> 33:58.480
         She's delicate.

33:59.050 --> 34:00.290
            - I know.

34:14.570 --> 34:16.540
      - Look, it's not like
 I want him around or anything,

34:16.540 --> 34:17.639
          it's just...

34:18.909 --> 34:20.739
       been a while since
we've heard from him, you know?

34:21.380 --> 34:25.980
  Uh, his parole officer called
        looking for him.

34:27.449 --> 34:31.280
    Did you report the thing
           last time?

34:33.620 --> 34:35.760
     - I followed procedure.

34:38.090 --> 34:39.530
  - Do you know what happened?

34:41.300 --> 34:43.530
      - What happens after
         isn't up to me.

34:44.570 --> 34:46.800
       But how many times
    has he just disappeared?

34:46.800 --> 34:50.100
  I'm sure he'll just show up.
         Unfortunately.

34:52.570 --> 34:55.639
             - Yeah.
  Yeah, you're probably right.

35:05.390 --> 35:07.550
         - He came over
       a couple days ago.

35:08.990 --> 35:10.820
    My mom told him to leave.

35:13.730 --> 35:15.830
       Told him she would
         call the cops.

35:18.570 --> 35:20.400
    - Did he hurt you again?

35:31.950 --> 35:33.150
             Kelly.

35:34.680 --> 35:36.350
     This is not your fault.

35:39.020 --> 35:41.150
     Do you want to tell me
         what happened?

35:45.930 --> 35:47.990
         (bell ringing)

35:49.160 --> 35:51.030
      - See you next week,
            Mr. Cole.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.500
     (Evan): Now, Fredrick,

36:30.510 --> 36:33.170
      please describe to me
   the feelings and sensations

36:33.170 --> 36:37.740
   you experience when raping
 your 15-year-old niece, Kelly.

36:41.380 --> 36:43.080
    - You've seen her, right?

36:44.650 --> 36:47.720
       She may be fifteen,
    but she's no little girl.

36:51.430 --> 36:54.490
       (cries out, coughs)
             - Shh.

36:57.070 --> 36:58.660
       Yes, I've seen her.

37:04.610 --> 37:06.270
   - Tell me you didn't think
          about fucking

37:06.270 --> 37:08.340
that sweet little mouth of hers.

37:10.280 --> 37:12.780
 It's not rape if she wants it.

37:13.380 --> 37:15.310
      She always wanted it.

37:16.950 --> 37:18.920
        Just look at her.

37:20.360 --> 37:23.060
           (cries out)
            Oh, fuck!

37:23.060 --> 37:24.790
            (gasping)

37:26.390 --> 37:28.330
       What the fuck, man?

37:29.600 --> 37:30.930
       - Please, continue.

37:30.930 --> 37:33.530
            (gasping)
  - Jesus fuckin' Christ, man!

37:33.530 --> 37:36.140
           What the--
            (gasping)

37:36.140 --> 37:38.700
       (cellphone ringing)

37:51.220 --> 37:52.420
           - Hi, baby.

37:52.420 --> 37:53.850
            (Lauren):
    <i> Where the fuck are you?</i>

37:55.560 --> 37:58.160
    Andrew's got a 105-degree
          temperature.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.330
        We're taking him
   to the hospital right now.

38:00.330 --> 38:03.160
       - Okay, stay calm.
      I'll meet you there.

38:03.970 --> 38:05.300
       (cellphone beeping)

38:06.770 --> 38:07.970
              Fuck.

38:09.600 --> 38:10.840
            (gasping)

38:12.010 --> 38:14.970
    - Jesus fuck! Jesus fuck!

38:14.980 --> 38:16.410
             - Fuck.

38:16.980 --> 38:19.410
          - Fuck! Fuck!

38:21.450 --> 38:23.320
       - We're gonna have
 to cut this short, I'm afraid.

38:23.320 --> 38:24.620
        - Jesus fuck. No!

38:24.620 --> 38:26.350
           (cries out)

38:39.500 --> 38:41.830
       (gasping, choking)

38:46.370 --> 38:50.040
       (breathing heavily)

39:19.210 --> 39:21.710
       (indistinct chatter
          over speaker)

39:24.880 --> 39:26.250
        - Where were you?

39:26.850 --> 39:28.910
       - I couldn't sleep,
       so I took a drive.

39:30.320 --> 39:31.720
   - Thank God you were there,
             Marie.

39:31.720 --> 39:33.120
       - Of course, dear.

39:33.820 --> 39:36.490
      - He's gonna be okay.
   - How the hell do you know?

39:47.000 --> 39:48.170
          - He's fine.

39:48.170 --> 39:50.070
     He must have picked up
        a cold somewhere.

39:50.070 --> 39:52.570
    We gave him some Tylenol
    to bring down the fever,

39:52.570 --> 39:54.370
        and we're running
      a couple final tests,

39:54.380 --> 39:55.670
 and then you can take him home.

39:56.440 --> 39:57.940
      - Thank you, Doctor.
      - Thank you, Doctor.

39:57.950 --> 39:59.180
        - You're welcome.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.850
    - Um... it's not unusual

40:02.850 --> 40:04.920
           for babies
      to run a fever, so...

40:04.920 --> 40:07.850
    try not to get hysterical
     at every little thing.

40:14.060 --> 40:16.200
  - Can we ride back with you?

40:16.760 --> 40:18.100
     Marie can take my car.

40:18.100 --> 40:19.900
       - Yeah, of course.

40:19.900 --> 40:21.930
  (sirens wailing in distance)

40:22.900 --> 40:25.540
    - Seems like he's better
         already, right?

40:27.070 --> 40:30.610
(sirens wailing in the distance)

40:34.280 --> 40:35.880
          - Why don't I
      help you, dear? Hmm?

40:35.880 --> 40:37.150
   You've had quite the night.

40:37.150 --> 40:39.150
     - We all have, I think.

40:41.890 --> 40:43.360
        Thank you, Marie.

41:08.020 --> 41:11.980
   (baby crying over monitor)

41:11.990 --> 41:14.750
      (Marie over monitor):
   <i> There, there, little man.</i>

41:14.760 --> 41:17.420
     <i> Still feeling poorly?</i>

41:19.160 --> 41:22.760
         <i> ¶ Hush a-bye ¶</i>

41:22.760 --> 41:25.230
       <i> ¶ Don't you cry ¶</i>

41:26.170 --> 41:28.700
        <i> ¶ Go to sleep ¶</i>

41:28.700 --> 41:32.400
       <i> ¶ My little baby ¶</i>

41:33.370 --> 41:37.010
       <i> ¶ When you wake ¶</i>

41:37.010 --> 41:40.210
       <i> ¶ You shall have ¶</i>

41:40.850 --> 41:43.520
       <i> ¶ All the pretty ¶</i>

41:43.520 --> 41:47.550
       <i> ¶ Little horses ¶</i>

41:48.220 --> 41:51.090
         <i> ¶ Hush a-bye ¶</i>

41:51.990 --> 41:54.630
       <i> ¶ Don't you cry ¶</i>

41:55.860 --> 41:58.560
        <i> ¶ Go to sleep ¶</i>

41:58.570 --> 42:02.470
       <i> ¶ My little baby ¶</i>

42:02.470 --> 42:05.570
       <i> ¶ When you wake ¶</i>

42:06.470 --> 42:09.110
       <i> ¶ You shall have ¶</i>

42:09.640 --> 42:12.650
    <i> ¶ All the pretty ¶</i>

42:12.650 --> 42:15.880
       <i> ¶ Little horses ¶</i>

42:43.080 --> 42:46.110
     (intense techno music)

43:12.370 --> 43:13.810
             - Hey.

43:15.210 --> 43:16.610
         (baby fussing)

43:16.610 --> 43:18.140
              Yeah.

43:22.150 --> 43:25.320
    Next time, Daddy's gonna
   make sure it's done right.

43:26.390 --> 43:29.720
     Yes, he is. He's gonna
make sure he gets what he needs.

43:31.790 --> 43:34.160
          A happy daddy
       makes a happy home.

43:47.170 --> 43:49.510
       (knocking, sighing)

44:16.100 --> 44:18.670
          (soft music)

44:42.460 --> 44:46.270
       I'm trying, Andrew.
         But it's hard.

44:50.340 --> 44:52.100
      (cellphone vibrating)

44:58.550 --> 44:59.810
             Hello?

45:00.750 --> 45:02.150
         (Chris): <i> Mr. C?</i>

45:03.320 --> 45:04.920
        It was my fault.

45:06.690 --> 45:09.390
 I mean, it's just with my mom,
        you know, and...

45:10.420 --> 45:12.830
        they were, uh...
             (sighs)

45:16.200 --> 45:19.060
         I heard around
    that he was back, and...

45:19.570 --> 45:22.500
  there he was, in my kitchen,

45:23.540 --> 45:25.100
           half naked.

45:28.710 --> 45:31.740
  And my mom, she's just acting
   like this is totally cool,

45:31.750 --> 45:33.680
    totally okay and normal.

45:36.120 --> 45:38.480
       They're fucked up,
         and it just...

45:40.590 --> 45:42.320
       Just pissed me off.

45:47.600 --> 45:49.500
        I shouldn't have
     yelled at him, though.

45:52.900 --> 45:54.770
  - It's not your fault, Chris.

45:57.710 --> 45:59.440
    Everything will be fine.

45:59.970 --> 46:01.510
      I'll make sure of it.

46:04.250 --> 46:07.050
   - I don't know what I'd do
     without you, Mr. Cole.

46:09.580 --> 46:10.980
            For real.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.570
- You went out again last night.

46:28.470 --> 46:31.240
         - Chris called.
       He needed to talk.

46:31.970 --> 46:33.840
    - Shouldn't you save that
           for school?

46:34.510 --> 46:35.840
      - He's a special kid.

46:35.840 --> 46:37.640
          His dad beat
      the fuck out of him.

46:37.650 --> 46:39.040
         I can help him.

46:41.120 --> 46:42.310
     Is that where you were

46:42.320 --> 46:44.080
      the night Andrew went
        to the hospital?

46:45.320 --> 46:47.220
    - Good morning, everyone.

46:47.820 --> 46:49.350
      Lovely day, isn't it?

46:49.990 --> 46:51.590
     - I have to go to work.

47:01.140 --> 47:03.740
         - He just needs
      a little space, dear.

47:06.940 --> 47:08.210
       - Thank you, Marie.

47:08.210 --> 47:10.880
It really makes a big difference
        having you here.

47:15.480 --> 47:16.480
         (Chris): <i> Hello?</i>

47:16.480 --> 47:18.680
  - Hey, Chris, it's Mr. Cole.

47:18.690 --> 47:20.820
  You missed our meeting today.
       Is everything okay?

47:20.820 --> 47:23.520
       (Chris): <i> Ah, shit.</i>
   <i> Yeah, I'm-I'm good. Sorry.</i>

47:23.520 --> 47:25.560
   <i> My dad picked me up early</i>
    <i> and took me to a movie.</i>

47:25.560 --> 47:27.090
     <i> I-I completely forgot.</i>

47:28.030 --> 47:29.130
            - Really?

47:30.330 --> 47:33.470
        That concerns me,
  after our last conversation.

47:33.470 --> 47:36.870
    <i> - No, it's good, Mr. C.</i>
  <i> He's getting clean for real.</i>

47:36.870 --> 47:39.000
 <i> I-I really think it's gonna be</i>
      <i> different this time.</i>

47:39.010 --> 47:40.210
         <i> He apologized.</i>

47:40.210 --> 47:42.110
  <i> Feel really good about this,</i>
           <i> you know?</i>

47:43.210 --> 47:45.240
<i>I gotta go. See you soon, okay?</i>

47:53.650 --> 47:54.950
             - Hey.

47:56.260 --> 47:57.890
      I got kidney stones.
  I-I just need to see a doctor

47:57.890 --> 47:59.220
 to get something for the pain.

47:59.230 --> 48:00.660
      I'm dying over here.

48:00.660 --> 48:03.130
   - Get out of here, junkie,
    before we call the cops.

48:03.900 --> 48:05.060
     - That's not necessary.

48:05.070 --> 48:06.100
              - Go!

48:12.440 --> 48:13.510
             (sighs)

48:13.510 --> 48:15.010
         All the winners
       come out at night.

48:17.240 --> 48:18.780
   Thank God my shift's over.

48:25.020 --> 48:27.950
     (intense techno music)

48:48.140 --> 48:52.610
       (footsteps echoing)

49:18.410 --> 49:20.370
      (distant clattering)

49:21.940 --> 49:24.410
    (techno music continues)

50:25.370 --> 50:28.340
       (music intensifies)

50:28.340 --> 50:30.910
       (Evan): Hey there.
          (music stops)

50:30.910 --> 50:32.480
          - Hey. Uh...

50:33.210 --> 50:35.210
   I-I was just lookin' for...

50:35.220 --> 50:38.220
      - Oh, shh. It's cool.
        (pills rattling)

50:41.060 --> 50:43.320
          (stammering)
  - Well, yeah, I'm a little...

50:43.320 --> 50:45.320
    short on funds right now.

50:46.060 --> 50:48.590
      - Consider it a gift
       from a new friend.

50:51.930 --> 50:54.100
        (pills rattling)

50:58.940 --> 51:00.140
          (sharp gasp)

51:00.910 --> 51:03.080
           (gurgling)

51:21.460 --> 51:23.800
         (intense music)

51:34.780 --> 51:36.210
          - Mark Wells.

51:43.480 --> 51:45.020
       - The hell is this?

51:48.490 --> 51:50.160
     What the hell is this?

51:51.590 --> 51:53.930
         - You told him
      you were cleaning up,

51:53.930 --> 51:55.530
        yet here you are.

51:56.230 --> 51:57.560
           - Told who?

51:58.970 --> 52:00.970
          I don't know
   what you're talking about.

52:02.300 --> 52:03.400
              - No?

52:04.070 --> 52:05.670
      I'll give you a hint.

52:06.470 --> 52:09.310
        You've been lying
 to this person his entire life.

52:10.480 --> 52:11.710
             - What?

52:13.680 --> 52:17.780
     Look, I-I have no idea
what's going on here, man, okay?

52:17.780 --> 52:19.750
      So... please, just...

52:19.750 --> 52:21.320
     untie me and let me go.
       You made a mistake.

52:21.320 --> 52:23.560
      I won't say anything
        to anybody, okay?

52:30.200 --> 52:31.600
             - Mark,

52:31.600 --> 52:34.830
      please describe to me
   the feelings and sensations

52:34.840 --> 52:38.340
         you experience
     when beating your son.

52:38.340 --> 52:40.410
          (deep breath)

52:46.880 --> 52:48.610
    - You're that counselor.

52:51.550 --> 52:53.390
   Chris... told me about you.

52:53.390 --> 52:57.220
   I mean, he talks about you
     all the time, actually.

52:59.230 --> 53:01.490
        - We're not here
        to talk about me.

53:01.500 --> 53:03.730
        (labored breath)

53:09.500 --> 53:11.270
    You've done this before.

53:16.680 --> 53:18.210
         How many times?

53:19.650 --> 53:21.810
     - This is not about me.

53:23.320 --> 53:25.620
       Now, tell me about
       how you hurt Chris.

53:28.060 --> 53:29.990
            (crying)
 - My wife and I were fightin',

53:29.990 --> 53:31.320
           and-and...

53:31.330 --> 53:32.820
            (exhales)

53:33.530 --> 53:36.060
   Chris just got in the way,
             but...

53:36.730 --> 53:39.100
          It wasn't me.
   It-it-it was the addiction.

53:39.100 --> 53:41.900
        It was the person
 that I become when I get high.

53:42.540 --> 53:45.500
 (grunts, gasping and coughing)

53:47.110 --> 53:49.240
     I have a disease, man.

53:53.680 --> 53:56.350
          I-I relapsed.
     You're a shrink, right?

53:56.780 --> 53:59.280
  I relapsed. Relapse is a part
     of recovery, isn't it?

53:59.290 --> 54:00.620
             Please.

54:01.120 --> 54:03.490
        - I'll let you in
    on a little trade secret.

54:05.560 --> 54:08.530
That AA stuff is total bullshit.

54:09.560 --> 54:12.660
   All Chris wants is to know
   that his father loves him,

54:13.570 --> 54:15.170
      like every other kid,

54:15.940 --> 54:19.800
       and you betray him
  over and over and over again.

54:21.070 --> 54:23.040
  Because you like to get high.

54:23.740 --> 54:25.810
      You could give a fuck
         about your son.

54:27.610 --> 54:29.110
        I know you, Mark.

54:29.120 --> 54:30.880
   We've met a thousand times.

54:32.320 --> 54:34.450
        Now, why did you
        really come back?

54:36.290 --> 54:38.160
        - I love my son.

54:39.130 --> 54:40.930
      I want to get better.

54:40.930 --> 54:44.360
 I want my family back. Please.

54:45.400 --> 54:49.170
      Please. Ahh! I swear!
            I swear!

54:53.340 --> 54:54.740
     I just want a chance--

54:54.740 --> 54:57.240
      I just want a chance
 at a relationship with my son.

54:57.840 --> 54:59.610
        Hmm? As a father,
you gotta understand that.

54:59.610 --> 55:01.580
             Please,
I'm begging you, please. I know.

55:01.580 --> 55:03.280
        I know you think
   I came back for the money.

55:03.280 --> 55:04.520
    I didn't. I didn't know.

55:04.520 --> 55:05.980
          - What money?

55:06.490 --> 55:08.090
    - Chris didn't tell you?

55:08.920 --> 55:13.190
 His mom, some uncle she hadn't
    seen in years left her...

55:13.190 --> 55:17.100
       I don't know, man,
   I-- please, please, just...

55:19.470 --> 55:21.070
   I don't know, man, please.

55:34.310 --> 55:36.250
      I know guys like you.

55:39.650 --> 55:41.420
      Prison's full of 'em.

55:42.720 --> 55:44.960
 Monsters hiding in plain sight.

55:46.490 --> 55:48.930
     You'll never really be
           a father...

55:49.400 --> 55:51.030
          or a husband.

55:52.170 --> 55:54.630
 You'll never love anybody else
           that much.

55:57.740 --> 56:00.840
     What are you gonna do?
              Hmm?

56:00.840 --> 56:02.170
      What are you gonna do

56:02.180 --> 56:04.380
       when they find out
       who you really are?

56:06.880 --> 56:08.780
    - Thank you for sharing.

56:13.020 --> 56:14.820
          (sharp groan)

56:19.230 --> 56:22.460
            (crying)

56:44.020 --> 56:45.080
             - Mom?

56:46.420 --> 56:49.120
          - Hi, honey.
   - What are you doing, Mom?

56:49.120 --> 56:51.360
   <i> - Just a bit of gardening,</i>
             <i> honey.</i>

56:53.230 --> 56:54.390
       - I saw you, Marie.

56:54.390 --> 56:55.730
     - You're not taking him
            anywhere.

56:55.730 --> 56:57.860
  - I need you to come with me,
           all right?

56:57.860 --> 57:00.430
 I'm gonna take care of you now.
    Doesn't that sound great?

57:00.430 --> 57:02.030
     - You get the fuck away
            from him.

57:03.600 --> 57:06.440
  (man): <i> Come on, we gotta go.</i>
   (Marie shouting, grunting)

57:07.540 --> 57:08.710
             Bitch!

57:17.720 --> 57:20.320
I am never gonna hurt you again,
           I promise.

57:20.320 --> 57:21.990
   Everything's gonna be okay.

57:27.260 --> 57:29.160
           (gurgling)

57:50.950 --> 57:52.820
   - You're a good boy, Evan.

57:53.620 --> 57:55.020
        Mommy loves you,

57:55.020 --> 57:57.990
     and I'm never gonna let
   anything bad happen to you.

57:57.990 --> 58:00.360
   Everything's gonna be okay.

58:42.170 --> 58:45.100
  - I'm glad you're taking care
          of yourself.

59:10.100 --> 59:12.330
 - Did you go for another drive
            tonight?

59:14.230 --> 59:15.470
            - Mm-hmm.

59:21.010 --> 59:22.970
- I need to know if you're okay.

59:24.880 --> 59:29.110
     - It's been stressful,
       but I feel better.

59:35.290 --> 59:37.760
- I need you here with us, Evan.

59:47.630 --> 59:48.930
           - I'm here.

01:00:15.730 --> 01:00:17.730
       (TV in background)
           - Honey...

01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:21.130
     I thought you told her
 not to watch TV with the baby.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.800
         - I did. Sorry.

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:31.180

01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:48.830
          - I'm sorry.
     It won't happen again.

01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:53.830
       - Okay. Thank you.

01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:14.350
        - It's my fault.

01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:22.590
          I hated him.

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.360
   - It's not your fault, Ray.

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:29.100
         - I hated him,
   but I didn't want him dead.

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:32.640
  - Ray, I promise things will
      get better with time.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.210
   - How the fuck do you know?

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.610
            - I know.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:45.320
  Kelly, let's talk about this.

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.950
       How you feel about
  what happened to your uncle?

01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:04.900
    - He wasn't the best dad,

01:02:06.010 --> 01:02:08.640
       but he was my dad,
      and he was changing.

01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:11.510
    He really was, Mr. Cole.

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:17.950
        Whoever did this
    took away my only chance

01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:19.050
    to ever really know him.

01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:20.550
     You know, the real him.

01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:24.290
 - Chris, I know this is hard...

01:02:25.790 --> 01:02:28.630
 But do you really think he was
  gonna be able to stay sober?

01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:31.630
     I'm sorry for the pain
   that you're going through.

01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:35.570
  I know it's almost impossible
   to find any glimmer of hope

01:02:35.570 --> 01:02:37.170
    in these moments, but...

01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:40.810
  Don't you think that this is
  maybe a blessing in disguise

01:02:40.810 --> 01:02:42.170
      for you and your mom?

01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:44.410
 - How could you even say that?

01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:50.680
      - I've known many men
     just like your father.

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:54.490
  My father was just like him,

01:02:56.090 --> 01:02:58.960
and he did to me the same things
  your father was doing to you.

01:03:01.930 --> 01:03:03.730
   He was never gonna change.

01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:06.530
        I think deep down
         you know that.

01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:08.370
              - No.

01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:12.800
  He was spending time with me,
       he was going to AA,

01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:13.840
      he was getting help.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.340
        - He lied to you.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.180
         Don't you think
      it's a bit convenient

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:19.640
that he shows up clean and sober

01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:22.050
       right when your mom
   gets some big inheritance?

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:27.890
    - How did you know about
        the inheritance?

01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:34.360
       - Well, you told me
      in our last session.

01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:36.660
       Don't you remember?

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:38.700
              - No.

01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:40.870
     I don't remember that.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.500
 - Well, I can understand that.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.170
     Periods of high stress
       can affect memory.

01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:48.940
  It's quite common, actually.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.550
       - Yeah, okay, sure.
     You're probably right.

01:03:54.550 --> 01:03:55.610
            - Chris.

01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:58.820
   We're not finished talking
           about this.

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:01.590
       - Uh, I'll see you.
   I'll see you later, Mr. C.

01:04:04.690 --> 01:04:06.390
           (knocking)

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:36.050
    - Good afternoon, ma'am,
    I'm Detective Overstreet.

01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:38.490
 Is this Evan Cole's residence?

01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:41.590
             - Yes.
     - And you're Mrs. Cole?

01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:43.960
    - Yes. What's this about?

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:47.400
  - Well, I just need to speak
  with your husband, Mrs. Cole.

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.570
           Is he home?

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:53.400
 - No, but he should be shortly.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.140
          - I can wait.

01:05:01.210 --> 01:05:02.350
            Mr. Cole,

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.920
  I'm sure you've heard by now
      about the burial site

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.920
  that was uncovered over near
  the Pine Street Development.

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:10.690
           - I heard.

01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:13.360
         It's horrible.

01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:17.800
  - Did you know all three men
    had one thing in common?

01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:24.000
  They all have relatives that
  are students at your school.

01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:27.340
           In fact...

01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:33.480
      I believe you see all
  of the students in question.

01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:36.610
        - Yes, of course.

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:39.050
           They're...

01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:43.850
       they're very upset.
     It's very hard on them.

01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:48.660
I'm sure you know, Detective...?

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:52.530
          - Overstreet.

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.170
        - ...Overstreet.

01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:59.700
   All my clients are children
            at risk.

01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:03.840
  Many of them have problematic
         family lives--

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:07.810
           drug abuse,
  criminality, mental illness.

01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:12.050
   Often their family members
     are at risk themselves.

01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:14.790
         And our school
   is a regional high school,

01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:16.590
 with over 5000 students, so...

01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:18.620
       - Yeah, well, uh...

01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:22.360
  We have several options that
  we're looking into right now.

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.260
     How long have you been
       a counselor there?

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:28.130
        - Social worker.
             - Oh...

01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:29.530
      - Little over a year.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:34.710
  Are you saying that you think
   that I might have something
        to do with this?

01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:38.740
   - It raises some red flags.

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:44.880
      But I'm just covering
          all my bases.

01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:46.880
          - Of course.
        - You understand.

01:06:46.890 --> 01:06:48.550
  - We've all got a job to do.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:50.620
             - Mmm.

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:53.790
    (quietly, pen scribbling)
            Social...

01:06:53.790 --> 01:06:55.730
       Now, where were you
         working before?

01:06:57.130 --> 01:07:00.030
     - I'm happy to send my
 employment record if you like.

01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:08.140
          - Uh... okay.

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:11.980
           Thank you.

01:07:14.410 --> 01:07:15.710
           And, uh...

01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:20.890
         Here's my card.

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.090
         Any information
        will be helpful.

01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:26.890
      I'll show myself out.

01:07:44.110 --> 01:07:45.980
        Uh, Mrs. Cole...

01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:52.180
      Has your husband had
     any late night absences
      that you've noticed?

01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:54.190
(Marie): Of course not, officer.

01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:58.260
   My son is a very dedicated
       father and husband.

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:02.430
          - Mrs. Cole?

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:06.500
              - No.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:08.930
       Nothing like that.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.180
   - Are you a heavy sleeper,
           Mrs. Cole?

01:08:25.649 --> 01:08:28.790
          (baby crying)
     - Excuse me, Detective.

01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:32.960
          - Oh, no, no.
        Here you go, Mom.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.830
  - Thank you, Marie. Shh, shh.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.069
          - Thank you.

01:08:54.250 --> 01:08:55.510
            - Don't.

01:08:58.420 --> 01:08:59.550
          - What is it?

01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:02.550
           - Nothing.

01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:06.319
          It's nothing.

01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:11.930
           (birdsong)

01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:20.100
           (knocking)

01:09:26.109 --> 01:09:29.080
      Oh, hello, Detective.
      Evan's still at work.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:33.020
      - I'm not here to see
        Mr. Cole, ma'am.

01:09:40.029 --> 01:09:41.859
      - What is this about?

01:09:44.029 --> 01:09:45.260
             - Um...

01:09:48.069 --> 01:09:50.569
    Do you know Chris Wells?

01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:54.100
 - He's one of Evan's patients.

01:09:55.170 --> 01:09:57.940
 - Did your husband ever see him
     outside of his office?

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:00.950
              - No.

01:10:04.150 --> 01:10:05.580
         - Are you sure?

01:10:07.150 --> 01:10:09.220
  - What are you trying to say,
           Detective?

01:10:13.690 --> 01:10:15.260
          - How long...

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.460
           have you...

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.300
       known your husband?

01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:23.230
    - Three years. Why?

01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:28.770
    - You know where he lived
         before you met?

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.910
     - Uh, near the desert.

01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:37.850
     I really don't see why
 this matters at all, Detective.

01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:40.750
       - Uh, well, a year
      after he left Hemet,

01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:42.750
     police uncovered a site

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:45.090
   not unlike the Pine Street
          Development.

01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:49.330
   - What does that have to do
         with anything?

01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:53.000
        - Maybe nothing,

01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:55.400
         but it's my job
       to see connections,

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:58.970
  and right now, I have to say,
 I'm beginning to see something.

01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:08.710
          - Do you know
     where your husband was

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:13.520
     the night of Thursday,
           March 26th?

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:22.160
    - I do, actually. He was
    at the hospital with me.

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:24.600
       Our son was running
          a high fever,

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.200
  and we took him into the E.R.

01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:31.700
             - Uh...

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:38.140
       Now, this camera is
          at the corner

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:40.040
     of Third and MacDonald.

01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:43.550
     Now, is this on the way
   to the hospital from here?

01:11:44.150 --> 01:11:45.320
     'Cause I have to admit,

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.180
          I don't know
  this neighborhood very well.

01:11:58.530 --> 01:12:00.860
 - Do you have kids, Detective?

01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:03.530
      - Never had the urge.

01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:10.210
     - When you have a baby,
       everything changes.

01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:12.880
   But not like everyone says.

01:12:13.450 --> 01:12:15.380
  It's like you're going crazy.

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.620
        You never sleep.
  The baby cries all the time.

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:21.850
    Every little thing feels
         like a crisis.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.390
  I can't even describe to you
       what it feels like

01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:28.360
   to be filled with love and
  total panic at the same time.

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:31.900
          - Yeah, well,
  I'm sure it's very difficult,
        Mrs. Cole, but--

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:34.530
 - My husband deals with people
      in crisis every day,

01:12:34.530 --> 01:12:37.940
   and he was coming home and
 feeling like he was in crisis.

01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:42.240
 He took drives, alone at night,

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.270
    for some space and peace,
      and do you know what?

01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:46.910
      I totally understand.

01:12:47.710 --> 01:12:49.350
   And I gave him that space,

01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:51.480
           and trusted
    that he would come home.

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:53.580
           And he did.

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.890
         He always did.

01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:07.130
             - Hmm.

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:15.570
   Give me a call if you think
       of anything else...

01:13:17.210 --> 01:13:19.080
    or you just want to talk.

01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:22.550
       Because from where
          I'm standing,

01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:24.450
       it's just a matter
            of time.

01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:29.990
     - Thank you, Detective.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.190
     I'll keep that in mind.

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:41.200
 That detective came over again.

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:44.540
   - Oh, yeah? What'd he want?

01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:48.140
- Asked me a bunch of questions.

01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:52.540
      About where you lived
     before you moved here.

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.380
      And he also asked me
         where you were

01:13:57.380 --> 01:13:59.280
    the night we took Andrew
           to the E.R.

01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:07.620
 - Really? What'd you tell him?

01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:10.530
 - That we were at the hospital,
           of course.

01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:15.730
        - Well, hopefully
     he won't be back around
      to bother you again.

01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:22.570
          - Hopefully.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.420
       (TV in background)

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.420
 - I'll tell her to turn it off.

01:14:44.530 --> 01:14:45.830
          (Evan): Mom.

01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:46.960
    <i> (TV): Police are trying</i>
      <i> to find a connection</i>

01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:48.370

01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:06.280

         - Turn it off.

01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:08.720

01:15:20.970 --> 01:15:24.500
 (Chris, at a distance): Mr. C?
      Come out here, Mr. C!

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:27.440
          - What is it?
       - It's Chris Wells.

01:15:28.170 --> 01:15:29.540
      I'll take care of it.

01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:32.380
      It's okay. I got it.
       (pounding on door)

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:33.710
            - Mr. C!

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:40.120
             Mr. C!
            - Chris.

01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:43.320
       Hey. You all right?

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.320
      - I know it was you.

01:15:46.190 --> 01:15:47.720
      - What was me, buddy?

01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:50.230
   - I know you killed my dad.

01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:53.100
     - Chris, you're drunk.

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:55.830
       - I never told you
   about the money. I know it.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.740
    Which means he told you.
          - Calm down.

01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:01.940
  Let me make you some coffee,
         and we'll talk.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:04.740
   - I don't think so, Mr. C.

01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:09.810
       Tell me the truth.

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.920
   - I would never do anything
          to hurt you.

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.620
 You're like a son to me, Chris.

01:16:17.290 --> 01:16:18.960
I just want the best for you.

01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:22.760
             - Evan.

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:27.100
      - It's okay, Lauren.

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:28.870
  Take Andrew back to his room.

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:31.800
             Lauren.

01:16:41.410 --> 01:16:42.650
           It's okay.

01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:47.650
        It's okay, Chris.
    You'll be all right. Shh.

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:52.220
      Shh. You'll be okay.
         It's all right.
         (Chris crying)

01:16:53.930 --> 01:16:55.630
              Shh.

01:16:57.130 --> 01:16:59.730
         Shh. It's okay.

01:16:59.730 --> 01:17:02.070
              Shh.

01:17:04.770 --> 01:17:06.640
              Shh.

01:17:14.010 --> 01:17:15.550
      You're gonna be okay.

01:17:19.690 --> 01:17:23.590
 Come on, let me take you home.
       You sleep this off.

01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:26.060
        - Don't touch me!

01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:29.490
         (door slamming)

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:40.340
     - I'm sorry about that.

01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:42.710
        He's confused...

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:45.340
          traumatized.

01:17:55.690 --> 01:17:57.720
          (baby crying)

01:17:59.490 --> 01:18:01.690
        I got it. Sleep.

01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:14.100
      I like to think that
     I'm a good man, Andrew.

01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:17.440
       That I help people.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:22.250
      (Evan over monitor):
       <i> But sometimes life</i>
    <i> backs you into a corner,</i>

     <i> any choice. You know?</i>

01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:31.350
    (chuckles)<i> No, you don't,</i>
          <i> do you, pal?</i>

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.820
            <i> Not yet.</i>

01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:38.160
<i>But no matter what, I love you.</i>

01:18:39.670 --> 01:18:42.400
   <i> I'll do whatever it takes</i>
      <i> to keep us together.</i>

01:18:47.710 --> 01:18:48.910

01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:34.970
   (baby fussing, music stops)

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:37.270
         - He's hungry.

01:21:40.510 --> 01:21:41.680
          Here you go.

01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:51.590
        I think our Evan
    is in a tough spot, dear.

01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:53.760
           Don't you?

01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:57.990
     It wasn't easy for him
            as a boy.

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.300
      He was... different.

01:22:02.970 --> 01:22:05.170
    But Evan was a good boy.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.810
      And he's a good man.

01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:15.910
     He learned the hard way

01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:19.480
          that children
     need to be protected...

01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:24.690
          that families
      need to be protected.

01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:37.970
    But now you have a family
     of your own to protect.

01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:43.740
          Sometimes...

01:22:44.410 --> 01:22:47.580
        the cost of that
          protection...

01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:50.680
    ... can be a little high.

01:22:59.090 --> 01:23:01.830
     It must have been hard
          for you too,

01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:04.690
        as a little girl
         with no family.

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:09.600
         I can't imagine
     what you went through.

01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:14.770
      - It was horrible...

01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:18.010
     the things I had to do.

01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:26.380
  - Thank goodness Andrew will
 never have to go through that.

01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:34.390
     We do everything we can
          for our sons.

01:23:35.730 --> 01:23:37.360
         Don't we, dear?

01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:55.410
        - Hi, sweetheart.

01:23:55.410 --> 01:23:58.080
          <i> - Hey, babe.</i>
     <i> Can you do me a favor?</i>

01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:59.250
          - Of course.

01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:01.150
     <i> - Can you watch Andrew</i>
         <i> after school?</i>

01:24:01.150 --> 01:24:02.990
           - Oh. Uh...

01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:05.020
      <i> - I need to get out</i>
 <i> of the house for a few hours.</i>

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:06.660
     <i> Go get my nails done,</i>

01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:08.930
   <i> go to the grocery store--</i>
         <i> I don't know.</i>

01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:11.090
 <i> Anything that doesn't involve</i>
       <i> getting puked on.</i>

01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:13.930
        - Sure. Of course
         I'll watch him.

01:24:13.930 --> 01:24:15.400
    <i> - Thank you, sweetheart.</i>

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:18.800
  I'll be home before bedtime.

01:24:33.690 --> 01:24:36.250
          (deep breath)

01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:49.530
     It's Lauren, Mrs. Cole.

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:52.940
               Hi.

01:24:55.710 --> 01:24:58.840
  Listen, I heard what you said
           last night.

01:25:00.450 --> 01:25:01.850
         I believe you.

01:25:02.710 --> 01:25:04.550
        <i> Um, I'm afraid.</i>

01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:08.120
     <i> I'm afraid for Andrew,</i>
  <i> and I need to do something.</i>

01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:10.890
              <i> Yes.</i>

01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:15.020
   <i> Thank you. See you there.</i>

01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:27.540
   - Did Lauren leave already?

01:25:28.170 --> 01:25:30.040
           - She said
     she was going shopping.

01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:33.640
             - Yeah.
    She said she needed time.

01:25:35.010 --> 01:25:36.580
     - And you believe her?

01:25:40.150 --> 01:25:41.680
     - Lauren would never...

01:25:42.650 --> 01:25:44.350
     She needs this family.

01:25:48.130 --> 01:25:49.660
      - What about the boy?

01:28:09.330 --> 01:28:10.370
       (Chris): Mrs. Cole?

01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:19.840
    Do you really believe me?

01:28:21.810 --> 01:28:23.250
       - He did it, Chris.

01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:26.650
          But the thing
      that makes it so sad,

01:28:27.090 --> 01:28:28.850
   is that he did it for you.

01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:34.860
    I'm really sorry, Chris.

01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:38.060
            (gunshot)

01:29:20.970 --> 01:29:22.470
            - Lauren.
             (gasps)

01:30:03.450 --> 01:30:05.080
   (Lauren): Hello, Detective.

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:07.680
           - You know,
     it's a different world.

01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:11.850
    These kids put everything
        on the Internet.

01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:19.960
        You have any idea
 how he could have gotten access
         to your files?

01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:24.500
   - I let him get too close.

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:29.440
          Let him, uh,
        hang in my office

01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:31.210
 when he was trying to get away
        from everything.

01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:34.140
     Maybe I shouldn't have.

01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:39.720
    - Well... with the, uh...

01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:44.390
 confession and the, uh, suicide
  with the victim's own weapon,

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:48.120
   not much else to look into.

01:30:50.630 --> 01:30:53.160
  And I'm sorry for your loss,
            Mr. Cole.

01:30:56.130 --> 01:30:57.830
     - Thank you, Detective.

01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:09.710
      - Well, I will, uh...

01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:13.080
      I'll show myself out.

01:31:17.190 --> 01:31:18.790
      - Goodbye, Detective.

01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:21.590
        Thank you so much
        for stopping by.

01:31:40.510 --> 01:31:41.940
